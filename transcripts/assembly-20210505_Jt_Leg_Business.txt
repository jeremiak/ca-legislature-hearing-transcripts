AND EXPRESS ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA OUR DEEP APPRECIATION FOR CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL AND FRONTLINE WORKERS INCLUDING THOSE OF OURSE ARE REGULATED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO INCLUDING THOSE IN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS- AND AGAIN ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR TIME AND THEIR ENERGY- AND IN MANY CASES REST THEIR LIVES- TO PROTECT HOURS. WITH ME TODAY FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IS DR HOWARD KRAUSS OUR BOARD VICE PRESIDENTS AT BILL PACIFICA OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REGGIE VERY GEEZ ARE DEPUTY DIRECTOR TERRY WEBB OUR STAFF COUNSEL MARINO CONNOR OUR CHIEF OF LICENSING AND JANET JONES OUR CHIEF OF ENFORCEMENT WE GET TO QUESTIONS ALL OF US WILL BE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT. I COURSE CONSUMER PROTECTION IS THE BOARD'S HIGHEST PRIORITY AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS PROVIDES FOR US TO DISCUSS OUR MISSION WITH ALL OF YOU. WE LOOK FORWARD TO GOING THROUGH THE TOPICS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET TO DURING OUR PRIOR HEARING. ONE AREA OF PRIMARY CONCERN FOR THE BOARD THIS YEAR IT'S RIGHT TO REGAIN SOLID FINANCIAL FOOTING. THE BOARD'S REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES ARE GREATLY IMBALANCED AND THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR WERE SEEKING A FEE INCREASE WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE FEE AMOUNTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. THE BOARD RECOGNIZES THE CONCERNS THAT MAY COME ABOUT WITH THE SIZE OF THE FEE INCREASE THATWE ARE SEEKING AND WE HOPE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE MAY CAN. CONTINUE AND ADVANCING OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION MISSION. THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO FINDING NEW WAYS TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS AND NEW EFFICIENCIES. ONE WAY IS THROUGH THE BOARD'S LICENSING PROCESS WHICH WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AS WE ARE REVIEWING HOW WE CAN REDUCE OUR PERHAPS EVEN ELIMINATE PAPER FROM OUR INITIAL APPLICATION AND LICENSE RENEWAL PROCESS THESE. OUR STAFF OF IDENTIFIED CERTAIN STATUTES THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF PAPER. WE HOPE TO SEE THESE AMENDED THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT WE CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN OUR LICENSING PROCESS. COURSE THE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ALSO ACCELERATED OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADOPTING NEW EFFICIENCIES THERE WHEN THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. WITH THAT CHAIRMAN WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU WERE CHAIR LOW HAVE OR TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MS LAWSON UP LET'S TURN TO. MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES. FOR THE BOARD MEMBERS OR BOARD STAFF INCLUDING MS LAWSON PERHAPS STARTING WITH MY- DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES SHARE LOW. HE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO HAVE SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS ONE OF ONE TWO BUT I WANTED OF POSE A QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO FEE INCREASES- TO- MISTER PER FISCAL. SINCE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OVER AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS THE BORDER DIGNIFIED ANY OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES- EITHER IN LICENSING OR ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED OR IMPACTED THE NEED FOR A FEE INCREASE SPECIFICALLY. YES WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I CAN ASSURE YOU FROM THE TIME THAT I FIRST STARTED OBVIOUSLY ARE THE FISCAL ISSUE WAS OF UTTER PRIORITY AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR EFFICIENCIES. AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE RESOURCES OF THE MEDICAL BOARD ARE DEVOTED TO ENFORCEMENT AND THEREFORE OPERATING ENFORCEMENT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY. IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY WHAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE THE TIME THAT I HAVE BEEN HERE IS WE HAVE INVESTED MORE IN REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS AT THE EARLIEST STAGES. TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TRIAGE AND MAY THE COMPLAINTS. ARE AND THIS INCLUDES A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF MEDICAL REVIEW OF CASE. WHERE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCE IT HAS OBVIATED THE NEED FOR CASES TO GO TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION WHEN THERE IS AN INITIAL DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS NO DEPARTURE FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE. FURTHERMORE IT'S THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THESE CASES WHICH WILL AT THE END DELIVER MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT AND MORE EFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT. SINCE THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE POSITION THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF CASES WITHIN THE COMPLAINTS SYSTEM. HAS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY THING IS FOR EACH CASE TO BE DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY THERE WILL BE SOME CASES THAT REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES. AND WILL REQUIRE- OF THE ABSOLUTE DEDICATION TO COME TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE WERE CASES ARE LESS SERIOUS BUT THERE IS NO ISSUE OF FITNESS TO PRACTISE IF WE CAN DEAL WITH THOSE EFFECTIVELY. AT AN EARLY STAGE THAT WILL BOTH PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND BE COST EFFECTIVE SO THAT IS ONE AREA OF SAVINGS THERE'S ANOTHER AREA OF SAVINGS IN TERMS OF. MAKING OUR LICENSING PROCESSES MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WITH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. WE'VE MADE MAJOR ADVANCES IN TERMS OF DOING OUR REVIEWS OF ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION ONLINE WE PARTNER WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY USE THE DOCKS PORTAL. AND THIS IS A WAY TO DO OUR JOB MORE EFFECTIVELY MORE EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT ANY DIMINISH THE QUALITY. FINALLY AS IN PARALLEL WITH OTHER STATE BODIES WE HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DELIVER FURTHER SAVINGS. AND SO WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES WE HAVE REALIZE SOME SAVINGS WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU DETAILS OF THAT. NOW AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THAT I CAN SAY THAT THE FIFTH FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS THAT WERE DELIVERED. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AT THE TIME THAT THE FEE INCREASE. WAS SOUGHT THEY HAVE IMPROVED BUT I MUST SAY IMPROVED MARGINALLY IT WAS ANTICIPATED. THAT WE WOULD BE AND DEFICIT POSITION IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. THAT IS NO LONGER ANTICIPATED TO BE THE CASE BUT STILL THERE IS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE WHICH WE HAVE. AND THAT CANNOT BE RECTIFIED BY THE CURRENT SAVINGS REALIZED IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE DETAIL IN TERMS OF OUR FUTURE SAVINGS I COULD TURN IT OVER TO OUR DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. MARQUISE PLEASE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF TWO X. SOME DETAIL OF ALL THE ACHIEVING THAT WE ACCOMPLISHED SO ALL LIKE MUST PRESS AND THIS ONLY AMOUNT TO ABOUT PER OF OUR OP AND SOME OF THIS IS- BABY IN ANY ANY ANY BILL ENTITY THAT YOU WOULD- UNDERTAKE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CHEATED THROUGH ABOUT NOVEMBER JANUARY- NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THIS IS A LIST OF ITEMS THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. AND BASICALLY WE LOOKED AT THE OPERATIONS TOP DOWN NOT JUST FOCUSING ON ANYONE UNIT LIKE LICENSING OR ENFORCEMENT BUT EVERY ASPECT OF THE WORLD'S OPERATION SO IN IN DOING SO WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AREAS LIKE WE WERE- STILL PRACTICING SOME OF BURNING THE DVDS AND UTILIZE SAYING OVERNIGHT MAILINGS OF MATERIALS TO OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE TO COOPERATE BUT FOR ENFORCEMENT ASPECTS WILL SO WE PUT A STOP TO THAT AND- START UTILIZING ONLINE CLOUD BASIS EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. AND ALSO- ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF OTHER MAILINGS THAT WE COULD ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFERRED WHEREVER WE CAN AND ALSO WE TOP DOWN EVERY DEPARTMENT EVERY STAFF MEMBER EVERY UNIT EVERY DIVISION ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY PRINTING UP DOCUMENTS AND ALSO WE TELEWORKING OF COURSE LEVELS AT BY PRODUCT OF KUWAIT BUT WE WERE ABLE TO UTILIZED TO THE MAXIMUM BY- ENABLING OUR STAFF TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE 100% OF THEIR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THROUGH TELEWORKING ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR HER TO COME INTO THE OFFICE SCAN AND PRINT OR COPY FILES AND TAKE IT WITH THE WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THEIR DOCUMENTS ONLINE. AND ALSO. ANOTHER AREA OF IMPROVEMENT BE MADE IN COST SAVINGS WAS IN THE PRINTERS SCANNER. AND RELATED SO. CONTRA IN ACROSS ALL- THE METAL BOARD AND WE ALSO USE OUR USE MORE AND MORE OF SHE- SITES REDUCE COSTS. ENSURING THE BETWEEN THE MEMBER. UTILIZING BY. TEAMS OUR SIR WERE. WAITING IN MAY. WAS A HUGE A FOR A- AT I MENTION STUFF CALL BE INDUSTRY MAIL AND SCAN AND- TO STAFF MEMBERS- AND ALSO- BE ONE OF THE MAJOR SAVINGS WE WILL ACHIEVE IT WERE WE WERE ABLE TO. WELL STOP THE BOARD'S NEW. AND PUBLISHING IT ON THE AND ALSO. IT BY. MEANS ANOTHER CALL SAVING AREA WAS IN IF. THIS LICENSE MEETS AND ONLY RENEW FOR WITH OUR APPS NO. ALMOST THESE SOME OF THE SAVINGS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE IN THE SHORT. IN ABOUT NINE TEN MY- GOING. BUT THERE ARE KERN WE ARE WE HAVE STOP IN LOOKING INTO IMPROVING. AND MAKING THIS A OR- SO CURRENTLY WORK PRO HARD IN THE AREA SAW IN A- WALLET. THAT WERE. EXT PRINTER PLASTIC COURT THAT ARE AT DISTRIBUTED BY. TO ALL THE LICENSE. AND THIS FOR IS KERN- WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECTED TO COMPLETE MY END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. AND ALSO WE ARE LOOKING INTO STARTING A PILOT PROGRAM FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURE TECHNOLOGY. ON CERTAIN BOARDS FORMS DOUBLE ELIMINATE- SUCH A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT FOR A NOTARY AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THERE'S A PILOT PROGRAM- AT THIS POINT BUT- THEY'RE ALSO THE PROJECTS THAT WE WOULD NEED YOUR SUPPORT. AND YOUR APPROVAL IN THE AREAS OF ST CHANGE INSPECTION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EVEN ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND COST IMPROVEMENT M. A. N- CONVERTING OUR RENEWAL. AND ONLINE. PROCESS TO MOVE AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL PAPER SO I WOULD STOP THEIR AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU AS KNOW WE'RE SENSE TO A FEE SPECIFIC NOT TO ON THIS BOY BUT AMONGST THE OF CONSUMER. THIS AS WE A LOOK AT THE SUNSET AND IS V. .COM OUT OF THE- COPA PENNED SO KNOW THAT YOU SHARE THAT SAME TYPE OF COMMITMENT ENSURING THAT TYPE OF EFFICIENCIES THAT WE HAVE AND I HOPE THAT. ARE COMEY SAID CAN WORK WITH YOU TO FURTHER FLESH OUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN THE FIVE FINALLY BEFORE PER TURN OVER TO THE- REST OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS NOW THEN PIVOTING TO THAT OF THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSES- ONE OF THE ISSUES. WITH RESPECT TO THE DETAIL RELATES TO THAT OF THE BILITY OF PHYSICIANS TO OBTAIN A FEDERAL TAX WAIVER TO PRESCRIBE MEDICATION USED TO TREAT THE OPIOID ADDICTIONS AS YOU WELL KNOW- AND- I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED THE SAME TYPE OF ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THAT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES. YES SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'LL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PTO LICENSE A CALIFORNIANS PRODUCED A THREE YEAR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AND OF COURSE AS YOU'VE NOTED THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE SIMILAR. TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS. ONCE THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO TEN FIFTEEN THAT WE'VE IDENTIFED THEY INCLUDE NEVADA- ARIZONA MASSACHUSETTS PENNSYLVANIA. NEW YORK OR AGAIN. AND OTHERS AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED AS YOU WOULD BE AWARE IS THAT THERE HAVE WE'VE ENCOUNTERED CERTAIN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH SOME THIRD PARTIES THEY INCLUDE MEDICAL IN TERMS OF. A REIMBURSEMENT- FOR MOONLIGHTING WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH SOME AGENCIES IN TERMS OF SIGNING DEATH CERTIFICATES WE'VE HAD OTHERS AS YOU SAID IN TERMS OF THE X. WAIVER. ISSUE WE HAVE REACHED OUT. TO THESE OTHER STATES- TO NEVADA AND FROM OUR PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THAT. WE ARE ENGAGING AT EVERY LEVEL TO COME TO SOME SOLUTION TO SOME OF THESE AREAS WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS TO THE F. S. M. B. N. TO OTHER AGENCIES. ARE FOR EXAMPLE A MAYBE ONE AREA WHICH IS OF GREAT CONCERN IS THE ISSUE OF X. WAIVERS AND I WOULD LIKE MY A COLLEAGUE MARINO CONNOR HEAD OF LICENSING. TO INDICATE WHAT WHAT THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING THERE TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. HI YES- WE DID MEET WITH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH. DETAILS OBTAINING TAX WAIVERS AND WE DID HAVE GOOD DISCUSSIONS WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH WITH THEM. ON A COUPLE OF TIMES TO EXPLAIN. WHAT OUR LAW ALLOWS. US TO DO IN THEIR SCOPE PRACTICE- YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE CENTRAL ISSUE IS- AND IF WE CAN WORK AROUND IT- SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM- ON THE X. WAIVER ISSUE- BUT THAT CURRENTLY JUST TO. POINT OUT- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU TELL HOLDER CAN BE ISSUED A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PERMIT ONCE THE ANTENNA PTL BUT THE ISSUE IS ATTAINING B. THE EX WEBER SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- CARILLO DR ARAMBULA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR CHAIR FROM ASSEMBLY BNP I'D LIKE TO ALSO ASK ABOUT THE POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING LICENSEES IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO FIRST STATE THAT OUR MEDICALSYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDER TREMENDOUS STRAIN OVER THE PAST YEAR MANY OF US MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE COME FROM AREAS THAT STRUGGLE TO HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND YET WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PART OF THE STRAIN MAY BE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF OUR POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING LICENSEES FROM BEEN BILLING MEDICAL FEE FOR SERVICE WHILE MOONLIGHTING. MANY OF OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES MANY OF THEM THAT I REPRESENT. MEDICAL AND IF WE ARE SHUTTING OFF ONE AVENUE FOR ACCESS TO CARE WE ONLY BROUGHT IN THE HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THIS SEEMS LIKE AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD QUICKLY FIX THE OPEN UP SERVICES. IF YOU COULD DOCTOR LAWSON AND MISTER PLUS HE FORGOT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PROVIDE THE BOARD'S PERCEPTION OF THE P. L. T. RESTRICTED STATUS FOR MOONLIGHTING. AND WHETHER YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE REMEDY WOULD BE THE ONLY COURSE OF ACTION TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND CERTAINLY THE PTO LICENSES- THE ACCESSIBILITY IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR THE BOARD ONE OF THE WHOLE REASON SUPPORT THE PTL IN THE FIRST PLACE. JUST TO REMIND EVERYONE WAS TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY BECAUSE WITH AN INTRODUCTION OF THE P. T. L. WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE. OF THE LICENSEES FROM OTHER MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHICH WE NEVER HAD BEFORE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DEDICATED TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM. WE ARE MEETING WITH% ALL THE RELEVANT OFFICIALS. AND THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE POSSIBLE FOR A SOLUTION TO BE REACHED. WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT TO OTHER PRESIDENTS WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. WE WILL DO THAT. IF NOTHING OF COURSE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE IF NECESSARY. BUT WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE ISSUE THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT WE COULD DO ADMINISTRATIVELY I MEAN AFFECTED LATE IF YOU TAKE A STEP BACK. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THESE DOCTORS ARE DOING IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED. THERE IS NO INCREASED RISK TO THE PUBLIC. THAT WOULD IN ANY WAY JUSTIFY THEM NOT BEING REIMBURSED FOR WORK THAT PREVIOUS GENERATIONS OF THESE LICENSEES HAVE BEEN DOING. IF ANYTHING I WOULD ARGUE THERE IS GREATER PRESSURE PUBLIC PROTECTION BECAUSE THEY ARE NOW FORMALLY WITHIN A PROGRAM IN THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS FOR APPROVAL WHICH WE THINK IS A VERY GOOD SAFEGUARD. BUT WE'RE ABSOLUTE DEAD. TO WORKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE HOPE LEGISLATION IS NOT REQUIRED. BUT IF WE REACH THAT DETERMINATION WE WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO ROLE IN IT TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ASSISTED AND PERHAPS- PRESIDENT LAWSON WOULD LIKE TO. ADD TO THAT. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS- EXECUTIVE OFFICER PACIFICA- AND- ALSO A SURE- DOCTOR ARAMBULA THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD IS COMMITTED TO THESE ISSUES THE MEDICAL BOARD- WILL BE MEETING ON MAY THIRTEENTH AND MAY FOURTEENTH AS A BOARD AND I. EXPECT THIS TO BE A TOPIC OF OUR CONVERSATION THERE AS WELL. I WANNA DIG INTO ONE OF THE POINTS THOUGH THAT HAPPENED MR PACIFICA HAD MENTIONED WHICH IS THERE'S NO RISK TO THE PUBLIC I THINK THE QUESTION I HAVE IS A FOR DECREASING ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC TO RECEIVE SERVICES. IF COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE DOCTORS. BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO BUILD FOR FEE FOR SERVICE IS THAT NOT A RISK TO THE PUBLIC. NO I BE JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS THE WRIST FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MEDIC COW. MEDIC COW ARE SAYING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THESE LICENSE THESE DOCTORS BECAUSE SOMEHOW THAT THEY ARE ON A RESTRICTED LICENSE. AND THEREFORE LESS ABLE TO PRACTICE I THINK THAT IS WRONG SO I WAS REFERRING TO THE REST FROM THE POINT OF MEDICARE. I ABSOLUTELY ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IF THERE'S ANY DEVIATION OF IN SERVICE THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM. AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO RESOLVING ISSUES OF LICENSEE IN WAYS. THAT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ACCESS. ASK FOR THIS. THIS IS OUR KRAUSS- WHAT YOU'RE GRADUATE MEDICAL AT WHICH ALL RIGHT FOR. IT'S KNOWLEDGE IS THAT MOONLIGHTING A SIX SO LONG IT IS WITH AS IT IS WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM I AM EVEN DURING MOONLIGHTING HOURS RESIDENTS IN TRAINING ARE STILL. UNDER SUPERVISION BY THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAM. THERE IS NEITHER INTENT NOR DESIRE ON THE PART OF THE BOARD BUT TO STOP MOONLIGHTING. I AND I AGREE DR ARAMBULA THAT MOONLIGHTING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT SERVICE OR HAS HELPED PROVIDE IMPORTANT SERVICE TO UNDERSERVED AREAS. IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE ALWAYS ARE FACED WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THIS PROBLEM WAS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED WHEN LEGISLATION WAS DRAFTED TO SEE THREE YEARS OF POST GRADUATE EDUCATION PRIOR TO LICENSURE AND AS MR PERCEIVED TO HAS SAID. WE ARE ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO THE TEN TO FIFTEEN OTHER STATES THAT ALSO REQUIRE MORE THAN ONE POSTGRADUATE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAVE FACED THE SAME PROBLEM. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A FIXABLE PROBLEM- BUT WE'VE JUST BEGUN TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN TERMS OF ULTIMATELY DETERMINING WHAT THE SOLUTION MAY BE- AND WE DON'T KNOW YET DEFERRED LEGISLATIVE ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED- BUT IT IS OUR INTENT. TO ALLOW MOONLIGHTING TO CONTINUE AS IT HAS SO THAT THERE IS NO INTERRUPTION OF MEDICAL SERVICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR KRAUSE AND THEN IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO ECHO OF OUR FOR GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN SAYS THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING IN SERVICE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAS IS HE HAD A CHANCE TO FIX SOME OF THE MISTAKES HE MADE WHILE IN SERVICE. I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE UPON THE LEGISLATION THAT THIS BODY HAS WORKED ON AND WE MUST BE RECEPTIVE TO WHAT MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES ARE SAYING. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE LOWER LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OR MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS WHO ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO MEET THIS CRISIS HEAD ON. P. AND WOULD ASK THIS- ESTES COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SPENDING THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO ADDRESS IT. IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH. ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND DE STIGMATIZING THE- SPEAKING OF MENTAL CARE IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN DURING A PANDEMIC BUT IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO THE DOCTORS WHO ARE FACING THIS VIRUS HAD ON IN OUR HOSPITALS ACROSS THIS NATION. POST TRAINING DR. KIDNEY POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING LICENSEES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS FIGHT AND WE SHOULD NOT PUNISH THEM FOR SEEKING THE CARE THEY NEED TO REMAIN FIT FOR THE COMBATING AGAINST. COOK AT NINETEEN. CURRENTLY THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ALLOWS THE MEDICAL BOARD TO ISSUE A PROBATIONARY PTL DUE TO THE ONGOING PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT. I'M CURIOUS DR LAWSON AND MR PACIFICA IF YOU MIGHT GO INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS CODE SECTION AND WHETHER YOU PERCEIVE THIS AS AN OBSTACLE OR SOURCE OF STIGMA FOR MANY. WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. DR ARAMBULA AND HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IF I MAY CARRY WEB STAFF COUNSEL. PLEASE PROCEED. ADD THE BOARD PRESHEAF THIS QUESTION VERY MUCH AND HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CHANGE ITS APPLICATION QUESTIONS SO THAT IT'S ASKING ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH OR PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT. WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE APPLICANT'S ABILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE SAFELY. IT'S NOT ASKING ABOUT PAST ISSUES IS NOTASKING ABOUT CONDITIONS THAT ARE WELL CONTROLLED. IT'S ASKING ABOUT IF THERE IS A CONDITION THAT COULD IMPACT THE SAFE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AT THIS TIME. AND BOB WAS A WORK IN IN PROGRESS BUT THE BOARD RECOGNIZED ABOUT IT DOES WANT TO SUPPORT PHYSICIANS AND IT AND- THAT DOES IN POST GRADUATE TRAINING TO. GET THE CARE NEEDED SO THAT THEY CAN BE HEALTHY. STANDS SO THE BOARD AUTHORIZED BY A CHANGE IN HOW THOSE QUESTIONS ARE WORDED. AND IT FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT A BARRIER- IT IS A NECESSARY QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND IF AN APPLICANT HAS A CURRENT CONDITION THAT IMPACTS THE SAFE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BUT THE BOARD IS NOT DIGGING IN TO INDIVIDUALS HOUSE TREATMENT OR ISSUES THAT ARE WELL CONTROLLED. FIND ME THEN IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN P. TALES AND HOW WE TREAT OTHER MEDICAL DOCTORS DO THEY GET ASKED THE SAME QUESTION REGARDING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. I DON'T AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION THOSE QUESTIONS ARE THERE THE SAME. THERE'S NOT. FOLLOW UP QUESTION AT A LATER TIME. BUT IF AN ISSUE COMES TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION ABOUT THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL CONDITION THAT IMPACTS SAFE PRACTICE THEN THE BOARD WILL ASK THAT PERSON TO VOLUNTARILY UNDERGOING EVALUATION. AND IF THEY WON'T AND THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY IT THE BOARD WILL SEEK TO COMPEL AN EVALUATION AND THIS IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP OFFLINE I JUST WANT TO ENSURE WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO DE STIGMATIZE WHAT ABSOLUTION AWFULLY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR MANY PROVIDERS ON THE FRONT LINES. AND TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO REACH OUT AND SEEKHELP WE SHOULD BE FIGURING OUT HOW TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SHOW UP AND FIGHT ON OUR BEHALF. THANK YOU DEFINITELY AGREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR UNDER THE DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY AND- THREE SHEETS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE BOARD- SO FIRST OF ALL JUST SORT OF FOLLOWING ALONG WITH- DOCTORING BILL AS- QUESTIONS- I KNOW IN ISSUE NUMBER SIX WE TALKED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE COVERED NINETEEN PROVIDERS IN ISSUE NUMBER FIVE POSITION HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS. I GUESS I SHOULD- FIRST OF ALL MAKE NOTE THAT NOT ONLY AM I A PHYSICIAN THERE FOR I GUESS MY TOPIC OF INTEREST I'M A LICENSEE OF THE MEDICAL BOARD- BUT ALSO- WAS FORMERLY A RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION- PRIOR TO BEING THE LEGISLATURE- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS UP. YOU KNOW A PART OF RUNNING A RESIDENCY PROGRAM I DID- YEAH I DID I WAS AWARE OF A PHYSICIAN WHO- BOTH IN TRAINING AND AFTER GRADUATION OF COURSE AND PRACTICE YOU DID HAVE SOME MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. BUT YET THE- WHEN WE TRIED TO APPROACH THE MEDICAL BOARD- IN TERMS OF. AND AGAIN THIS IS A WHILE AGO SO I DID I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS MAY BE THE CASE NOW- BUT THERE REALLY WEREN'T PROGRAMS TO HELP THIS POSITION BE ABLE TO- AND CONTINUE TO. PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CONTINUE PRACTICE I MEAN THAT'S NOT WHAT SOLELY NOT THE JOB IN AMERICA WERE TO DO THAT- THE MEDICAL BOARD COURSE DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF. CONSUMER PROTECTION SO FOUR THIRTY TO SPEAK TO WHAT WE'RE DOING- BECAUSE I SORT OF SEE THIS ISSUE FIVE AND SIX TOGETHER. TO HELP SUPPORT POSITIONS WHO MAY BE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- BUT- ONES THAT WOULD STILL ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE AND- AGAIN I THINK THE DRESSINGS THESEGMENT ISSUES WELL. THAT THEY CAN DO THIS AND YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE FORTHCOMING WITHOUT HAVING A MARK ON HEIR ESSENTIALLY THEIR LICENSING RECORD THAT AND OF COURSE. LEADS TO- I DON'T SCREEN IS NOT THE RIGHT WORD BECAUSE- WE WHAT. WE DON'T KNOW SAITO'S SCRUTINY BUT WE DON'T HAVE STIGMA AND THEN HAVING THEM BASICALLY BE LIMITED ABILITY TO PRACTICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS MARKUPS. TRAILS THEM EVERY TIME THEY APPLY FOR A- MEDICAL STAFF- APPLICATION OR- ANY OTHER THING BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST IN THE LICENSE THAT YOU NEED TO PRACTICE YOUR BOARD CERTIFICATION YOU HAVE. MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES- MANY OTHER MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICIANS NEEDS SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE MEDICAL BOARD'S WORK AND- PROVIDING THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. IN A NON STIGMATIZING WAY ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE BECAUSE CODED AND OUT OF WILL NOT POST CODE FORTY ONE MINUTES AGO THEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY. EALTH PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING PHYSICIANS WHO ARE. WHO ARE. YOU KNOW THAT BASICALLY TRYING TO LIVE A TRAUMA. YEAH SIR SIR CENTER PAM ALL RIGHT SURE YOUR CONCERN. THAT THERE ARE MANY ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT PHYSICIANS HAVE. THAT CANNOT BE DEALT WITH IN THE PUNITIVE WAY BUT REQUIRE SUPPORT- AND TO REQUIRES AN EMPHASIS ON. GETTING THEM WELL. I CERTAINLY- WHEN I RIDE ONE. THING THAT I NOTICED IS THAT THERE WAS NO POSITION HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM. CURRENTLY IN PLACE- AS YOU WOULD BE WELL NO THERE IS A LONG SOCIAL HISTORY TO THAT. BUT IT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE BOARD TO GET ONE. BACK UP AND RUNNING. WE CAN GIVE YOU DETAILS OF EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING THEIR THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT THE REGULATIONS IN PLACE- AND I CAN ASK OUR STAFF COUNSEL. MS WEBB TO GIVE YOU SOME DETAILS ON WHERE WE ARE IN THAT PROJECT AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO WITH IT. CREDIT MAYBE FOCUS I'D CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- WITH THAT INFORMATION AND PERHAPS- SHE CAN FOCUS REMARKS ARE SPECIFICALLY ON HOW TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A STIGMA FOLLOWING THIS AFTER. A PHYSICIAN WHOSE FORTHCOMING. AS WELL. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THAT CENTER PAM FOR THIS QUESTION AND- IT THE AS YOU MAY KNOW THE BOARD STAFF DID DRAFT. THOSE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE POSITION HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM AND THEN THERE WAS A MOVEMENT TO CHANGE THE UNIFORM STANDARDS FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSING MY CINCY IS WHICH THE BOARD'S. PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM MUST FOLLOW AND SO. THE BOARD STAFF REDRAFTED BE OPPOSE REGULATIONS SO THAT EVERY TIME THERE WAS A CHANGE SHOULD THE UNIFORM STANDARDS THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE CHANGED AND CHANGED TO THE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AND I AM VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT DCAS REGULATIONS UNIT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AS E'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT ECONOMIC INTERESTS TO SCHOOL TIME INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE RULEMAKING PACKAGE. AND SO DOT WILL BE MAKING PROGRESS WITH THE REVIEW PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED TO THREE D. CA AND BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY SO GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE THERE- AS FAR AS THE- STIGMA- DE PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW PHYSICIANS TO SELF REPORT AND TO YOU BECOME A PARTICIPANT IN THAT PROGRAM WITHOUT A REPORT BEING MADE TO THE BOARD SO LONG AS THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM SHE AND THAT THE UNIFORM STANDARDS ARE QUITE STRICT. AND SO IF- THEY'RE NOT FULLY COMPLIANT THEN THEY WILL BE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THAT WILL PUT THAT POSITION IN THE ENFORCEMENT PART BLACK- THIS A REQUIREMENT OF THE UNIFORM STANDARDS. AND SO IT WILL BE OVER A REQUIREMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT. THAT WILL MAKE IT LESS LIKELY FOR SOMEONE TO SELL HARPER- HEY. THAT IS A REQUIREMENT IN THE BOARD WILL FOLLOW THAT- I KNOW THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHO HAVE A HISTORY WITH THE BOARDS AND NOW DEFUNCT DIVERSION PROGRAM- WHICH ENDED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THE PHYSICIAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM IS NOT A DIVERSION PROGRAM. SO GEN IF A PHYSICIAN SELF PREFERS AND IS NOT FULLY COMPLIANT THEN. SENATE ACTION MAYBE THAT'LL COME. THE BRITISH APPRECIATE THE ANSWER I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE- WELL CERTAINLY THAT THE PREVIOUS DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT HAVE SOME ISSUES- THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO- UNFORTUNATELY PLAY ON THE FEARS OF THE PUBLIC- TO- TO ESSENTIALLY WE TALKED ABOUT THE DECREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WELL WE HAVE PHYSICIANS- AND JUMP PHYSICIANS ARE PEOPLE TOO THEY'RE NOT PERFECT- AND- AND SO YOU- AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND POSITION THE BOARDS AND- BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE REASONABLE- AND WE WANT TO BE SURE WE ARE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN. REALITY NOT JUST SYMBOLICALLY AND- THEREFORE DENYING OPPOSITION TO COULD PROVIDE SERVICES TO HE DIED VERY MUCH NEEDED SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC THAT- THAT WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE DEBATE NOT NIT PICKING THEM TO DEATH- AND ALSO CREATING HERE- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO COME FORWARD RIGHT- SO THEY ACCEPT THE FACT THEY HAVE A BIG ISSUE AND- AND THEN BUT YET CREATING AT THE POLICY YEAR OVER OVER THEM- THE DUTY IS FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY SELF. TO SEEK HELP AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF PRODUCTIVE BUT I APPRECIATE THE POSITION THE BOARD IS IN IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND PERHAPS WE CAN REVISIT THIS. ISSUE LEGISLATIVELY IN THE FUTURE. BEFORE YOU MOVE ON. PER MAY I TO THE THIS IS HOWARD CRY. BRIEFLY I DO HAVE MARK. SURE BUT BUT BUT I AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OR ACUTELY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM I. WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THREE PHYSICIANS IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WHO. COMMITTED SUICIDE AND THESE WERE NOT SUBSTANCE ABUSE CASES THESE WERE JUST. EST INDIVIDUALS WHO FEARED THE STIGMA OF COMING FORWARD AND HAVING TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE THEIR DEPRESSION- AND IS SERVING ON THE FEDERATION FOR STATE MEDICAL BOARDS- IT'S EVIDENT. THAT THIS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE ACTIVELY- WORKING ON THESE ISSUES HOSPITALS HAVE POSITION. AND WELLNESS PROGRAMS AND COMMITTEES. AND I THINK IT'S A GLARING DEFECTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A WELL FUNCTIONING. OPPOSITION HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON AND I KNOW THAT THIS SENTIMENT AND ACTIONS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. OR TO TRY TO- RECONSTRUCTION EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. WITH COOPERATION OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. POST HASTE. CHAU NO THAT OUR SYMPATHIES AND OUR INTENTION. OR TO ALLOW DOCTORS TO SELF DESIGNATE AND TO RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE LICENSURE SO LONG AS STATED BY MISS WEB. WE HAVE ADEQUATE ASSURANCES THAT THERE'S NO PUBLIC JEOPARDY. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN SENATOR PAT THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT IN FACT WHEN PEOPLE SELF DISCLOSE WE CAN PUT HIM UNDER SUPERVISION WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS PRIOR WHICH IF THEY DIDN'T. THEN THERE WOULD NOT BE THAT SUPERVISION BUT ALSO PUT AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP TO HIGH RATES UNFORTUNATELY. OF PHYSICIAN SUICIDE WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND WHAT THAT DOES TO DENY CARE TO COMMUNITIES AND HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR PUBLIC HEALTH- THE OTHER QUITE NEXT QUESTION ACTUALLY INTERESTING ENOUGH WE TALKED ABOUT THE- DETAILS- BECAUSE TRAINING LICENSES- INTERESTING ENOUGH I KNOW ISSUE TEN WE TALK ABOUT LICENSING TIME FRAMES- APPRECIATE. THE WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT- I NOTED THAT- IT'S REPORTED THAT. THAT THAT- BASICALLY- WORD THE AVERAGE TIME NOW FOR GETTING A LICENSETWENTY NINE DAYS OUT OF. MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WAS A TOOK OVER. SIX MONTHS. FOR ME TO YET AND MY INITIAL AND- THERE WAS NO ISSUE THAT THE MAY ISSUE ACTUALLY I CAN OUTSIDE WHICH I. PTL AND THOSE A CONTINUE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN THIS IS DECADES AGO AND THE MEDICAL BOARD OF MASSACHUSETTS WHICH OF COURSE I HAD. NO NO PROBLEMS OF MY LICENSE BUT BECAUSE OF THE P. T. L. THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT. SO NOW IT'S FINE IT'S INTERESTING WHEN HAVING DISCUSSION ABOUT DETAILS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- BUT I HOPE THAT- THAT THERE'S SOME CONVERSATION ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKING WITH OTHER STATES I KNOW SOME OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THERE ARE I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. WELL WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DETAIL THERE- PUT THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DO ONE- BUT I HOPE THAT- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- THE MEDICAL BOARD KEEPS- ARE COMMITTEES UP TO DATE AND ALSO TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO HELP. I REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES ARE ACTUALLY DECISIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEES A DETOX STANCE ABOUT THE X. WAIVER- THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM WE CAN CERTAINLY AYE KNOWS REACHED OUT TO DCS ABOUT THIS- THERE'S SOME CMS ISSUES. BUT WE REALLY SHOULD TRY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OTHER STATES AS YOU SAID TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS- AND RECOGNITION DATA. RESTRAINING LICENSE IS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED- EQUIVALENT TO A FULL LICENSE. OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT THE LICENSEES UNDER- THE SUIT. OF RESIDENTS. RESIDENCY PROGRAM BUT SHOULD OTHERWISE BE TREATED. BY WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC HEALTH FOR VITAL RECORDS OR BY. YOU KNOW- GOVERNMENT- HEALTH PROGRAMS OR- OTHER AGENCIES AS A FULL LICENSE AND- WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE PUSHING THAT. AS A- AS A POLICY- AS- SENATOR IF I CAN JUST INTERJECT THERE VERY BRIEFLY BRIEFLY. I CAN ASSURE YOU THE MEDICAL BOARD IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO DO EXACTLY THAT OKAY WE ARE WORKING WITH STAFF TO MEET SHAREHOLDERS. WE ARE DEDICATED TO RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. OKAY THANK YOU BUT I THINK IT'S AWFULLY WE CAN CLEARLY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE GENERAL POSITION SHOULD BE IS THAT PTL OPPOSE TRAINING LICENSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OTHER AGENCIES. AS EQUIVALENT TO A FULL LICENSE- ISSUE NUMBER NINE. SON CONDITION AND SEES- I KNOW WE TOUCHED ON THIS BEFORE AND THIS IS A REPEATED ISSUE FOR MULTIPLE BOARDS. BUT ONCE AGAIN I HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE AND THEY REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT- IS WHAT DOJ'S CHARGING THE VARIOUS BOARDS. AND I WOULD JUST. AGAIN REMIND PEOPLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOURLY ATE THAT THEY'RE BEING CHARGED. ESSENTIALLY FOR AN ATTORNEY IT'S EQUIVALENT OF. FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR- IF THAT WAS A FULL TIME ATTORNEY. AS A PARALEGAL WOULD BE A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND FERN ANALYSTS TO BE FOUR HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND YEAR NOW THE REALITY AGAIN IS THAT A SENIOR LET'S. LEGAL ANALYSTS- ACTUALLY GETS PAID BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT THE TOP VERY TOP OF THEIR SALARY RANGES ONLY SURE WHY THE- OF. BOARD WOULD BE CHARGE 400-500-0600 DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR SOMEONE TO GET PAID. EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND. AND EVEN A SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH IS THE HIGHEST RANKING- LAWYER- THAT'S A SHORT OF- GETS PAID AT THE TOP END OF THEIR PAY. COURT TO CAL EIGHT CHAR HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS A YEAR AT THE TOP AND THAT'S NOT THE AVERAGE TOP AND- YET WE'RE THE BOARDS ARE BEING CHARGED FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR. FOR AN ATTORNEY. AND I'M SURE WE'RE NOT GETTING A SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL EVERY TIME DOING TO INVESTIGATIONS I REALLY THINK WE DO NEED TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT. THAT THIS COST RIGHT FOR WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BOARDS INCLUDING MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN FINALLY- I DO WANT TO BRING UP- ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT- SOME MEMBER BLOOM AND I. WORKED ON- AND I HOPE THAT TO IN OUR- LEGISLATION TO- TO RE AUTHORIZE THE BOARD THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I KNOW THERE WAS SAYS THAT THERE'S A VERY POSITIVE QUESTIONS. UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY TAP INTO THE VERY AND THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THEM INTO THIS INTO A SUMMER BLOOMS- FINALISATION AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE BUT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT. FOR ACCREDITATION AND- BY AS AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION AS A REQUIREMENT FOR AN INSTITUTION TO. BE ABLE TO GET A- SPECIALTY FACULTY PERMIT- SO I KNOW IT'S ME NOTE AND- STAFF REPORT BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AGREED TO- AND I HOPE WE CAN. IMPLEMENT IT IN. AS PART OF THE- LEGISLATION RE IN RENEWING THE BOARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR FAN CLUB CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT AWAY- AND ASKED ABOUT LICENSED MIDWIFE- WE PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR- IN THE BOARD WAS GONNA- DID CREATE THE- THE PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY THAT THAT STALLED WHAT'S THE WHAT WHAT IS THE- THE STATUS OF THE- LICENSED MIDWIFE INDEPENDENT PRACTICE AUTHORITY AND- DO WE NEED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES OR WHAT DO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION IS- IS ACHIEVED. HI THIS IS SERRA KERRY WEBER AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- THE MEDICAL BOARD LICENSES AND REGULATES LICENSED MIDWIVES AND THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. WHY SINCE IS A REGULATORS CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES AND- CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES THAT WERE RECENTLY GRANTED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. LICENSE MIDWIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE BOARD SUPPORTS THEM ACTUALLY HAVING THEIR OWN BOARD AND TO BE OUT FROM UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD SINCE PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED FOR SOME TIME. THAT IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY'RE A LICENSE UNDER TWO DIFFERENT BOARDS THAT WE NEED MORE LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO- FURTHER MAKE THAT CLEAR. THIS APP IS A PART OF ADDING TO THE CONFUSION. ON IT. I THINK THERE IS CONFUSION BECAUSE- CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES ARE ACTUALLY REGISTERED NURSES TO DAN DEAD ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO BECOME CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES LICENSED MIDWIVES HAVE THEIR OWN PATHWAY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE MEDICAL MODEL. AND THEY- AND MOSTLY D. PROVIDE SERVICES IN THEIR CLIENTS HOMES WHERE A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES- VERY FREQUENTLY PROVIDE. THEIR SERVICES IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS FOR OUR BIRTH CENTERS- SO THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT. MODELED. HOW TO DIFFERENT- S. IS ON THAT PREGNANCY LAY DAY. AND THEIR REGULAR BY TWO DIFFERENT BUT IT DOES CREATE CONFUSION BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH MIDWIVES. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN ADJUSTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IN THERE ARE A LOT OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT WERE WORK ISSUED- IF SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ARE THERE ARE THERE ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED OR IS THERE ANY WAIVERS THAT WARRANT ANY STATUTORY CHANGES- ANY ISSUES RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC THAT YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH. HI IF I MAY THIS IS FRAN O'CONNOR- ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. PLEASE YES- THERE YES AS YOU SAID THERE WAS A NUMBER OF WAIVERS TO LICENSING REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE ISSUED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- A COUPLE OF THOSE ADDRESSTO BE EXPIRATION BY WHICH A- RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA MUST OBTAIN A POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE- THEY HAVE CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT LEVER UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH- CERTAIN RESIDENTS THAT MEET THE CRITERIA HAVE TILL JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR TO OBTAIN A PTL- WE ARE. STILL LOOKING AT- WHETHER OR NOT THOSE NEED TO BE EXTENDED OR NOT WE USUALLY- YOU KNOW KEEP AN EYE ON WHEN WE GET CLOSE TO THAT DATE- WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE IF THE WAIVER WAS NOT EXTENDED BEFORE MAKING THAT DECISION- BUT THOSE ARE TWO WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON AND THERE'S ALSO A CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION WAIVER FOR PHYSICIANS- UNLESS AS MIDWIVES CURRENTLY- THEY HAVE A SIX MONTH EXTENSION TO. COMPLETE THEIR CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS- WHICH BASICALLY GIVES UNTIL ABOUT AUGUST- SO THAT'S ANOTHER- WEAVER WORK WE'RE LOOKING AT- AND- THERE'S OTHER WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY- ISSUED- THAT IMPACT- THE- DETAILS ABILITY TO- ADMINISTER THE COVETED NINETEEN VACCINE- AS WELL AS- THINK. THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER THAT. THANK YOU US CENTER EGGMAN IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON. THE SENATORS LICENSED MIDWIFE QUESTION. A BIT IT WAS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AB THIRTEEN AWAIT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. REMOVE THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR A LICENSED MIDWIFE TO PRACTICE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN OF AN MD PHYSICIAN AND INSTEAD SPECIFIED THAT A MIDWIFE MAY ASSIST IN NORMAL PREGNANCY. AND BIRTH THE BOOK DEFINED BY REGULATIONS AND OUR ANALYSIS RECORD ON PAPER ANYWAY I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL HAVE READ. INDICATES THAT THE BOARD HELD SEVERAL INTERESTED PARTY MEETINGS ON THE REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT AB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT INCLUDING WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF ASSOCIATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE BACKGROUND PAPER NOTES A STICKING POINT IN THE DISCUSSION ON REGULATIONS WAS A LACK OF AGREEMENT ON WHETHER PRIOR. SYRIAN SECTION C. SECTION SHOULD BE ON THE LIST OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON EXAMINATION. PRIOR TO THE LICENSED MIDWIFE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE CARE PURSUANT TO. BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION TWENTY FIVE OH SEVEN. HAS THIS RATE YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CERTIFIED AND LICENSED MIDWIVES IN THIS THAT THE OTHER HAS THAT REGULATORY IMPEDIMENT BEEN RESOLVED AND ARE LICENSED MIDWIVES UNDER THIRTEEN OH EIGHT NOW FREE TO. INDEPENDENTLY PRACTICE PURSUANT TO THE STATUTE. CENTER PROCESS I MAY ANSWER THIS. I HAD. THAT REGULATORY REGULATORY HAS NOT BEEN THE BUT MIDWIVES ARE PRACTICE IN THE- THERE'S. USING MIDWIFERY STANDARD OF CARE AND THEIR JUDGMENT. AND THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL AT TEN TO WORK THE LEAD TO GET SOME CLARIFYING-LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WORDY- INCLUDED IN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE TWENTY FIVE OH SEVEN- FOR EXAMPLE- IT USES THE WORD. WHITE LEE. AND THERE ARE SO ANY PREVIOUS MATERNAL DISEASE OR CONDITION OR LIKELY TO AFFECT A PREGNANCY WELL THAT IS- YOU. MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS WHERE IT'S NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT THE PREGNANCY BUT THERE IS THIS MEDICAL RISK FOR THE DELIVERY TO OCCUR AT HOME- SO. THE BOARD DID SEEK. TODAY TO HAVE THAT CHANGED AS WELL AS THE REPORT. FOR WINTER CONSULTATION WITH A PHYSICIAN TO HAVE THE PHYSICIAN DETERMINED THAT THE CLIENT'S CONDITION OUR CONCERN HAS BEEN RESOLVED SUCH THAT THE RISK FACTORS PRESENTED BY WOMEN'S DISEASE OR CONDITION ARE NOT LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COURSE OF PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH WELL THAT'S THIS PUTS PHYSICIANS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION AND- WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY ABILITY INSURANCE DOES NOT SUPPORT POSITIONS. ENGAGING IN THIS KIND OF CONSULTATION AND MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. THAT WILL- THE CLIENT TO RETURN TO THE PRIME CARE OF THEIR MIDWIVES. AND SO ANOTHER WHERE BOARD LEGISLATOR SUPPORT TO- IT BASICALLY HAVE A DO THIS. AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION SO THAT THE CLIENT MAKE IN AND DECISION ON WHETHER- IF IT HOME BIRTH IS APPROPRIATE IN THE MIDWIFE NEEDS TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE STANDARD OF CARE SHE CONTINUED TO BE THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER FOR THEIR CLIENTS- SO FAR THAT. HAS NOT HAPPENED- IN THIS IS A THE- RELATIONSHIP BE AN- AND SO. THE BOARD AGAIN SUPPORT IS A MIDWIVES. HAVING THEIR OWN. FOR- AND IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIFFICULT LANGUAGE IN THIS. THE CARD SECTION WELL THE BOARD IS A SEPARATE ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH- STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND WHETHER OF A SEPARATE BOARD CAN. CAN FUNCTION OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TO START OUT IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT SITUATION DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES IN THE FEES THEY CAN FURTHER A WHOLE VARIETY OF ISSUES. INCLUDING I'M SURE PRACTICE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEPARATE BOARD BUT I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR WAS ATTEMPTING TO GET IT IS WHAT SORT OF FIX DO YOU NEED. IF THERE IS ANY IMPEDIMENT TO INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF THESE LICENSED MIDWIVES AND YOU. INDICATED THAT THEY'RE PRACTICING INDEPENDENTLY BUT HOW DO THEY PRACTICE. INDEPENDENTLY IF THE STATUTE ALLOWS THEM TO ASSIST IN A NORMAL PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH AND WE AND NOBODY IS DEFINED WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S A QUESTION BUT LET ME RAINY LET ME ASK ANOTHER ONE I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER I'M CERTAINLY NOT A PHYSICIAN. I USED TO BE A LAWYER. NOT ANYMORE. I GUESS. THAT I'VE- BEEN A MEMBER OF VARIOUS HOSPITAL BOARDS IN THE WAY BACK AND I REMEMBER. I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS THIS DEBATE OVER C. SECTIONS AND WHETHER. AFTER A C. SECTION YOU SHOULD HAVE A NORMAL DELIVERY OR NOT HAVE A NORMAL DELIVERY OR BE. HAVE ANOTHER C. SECTION AND SO THIS WHOLE LACK OF AGREEMENT ON CURRENCY SECTION. SEEMS TO BE SORT OF AN IMPEDIMENT WHICH WAS THE QUESTION ARE THERE ANY IMPEDIMENTS AND HOW. I GUESS WE NEED TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN A SUNSET BILL IN ORDER TO ALLOW LICENSED MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE STATUTE. CAN YOU HELP US. OKAY WELL. DO WE NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER SOMEONE WHO HAS A PRIOR C. SECTION MAY BE ATTENDED BY A LICENSED MIDWIFE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT LICENSE BID WIVES ARE PERFORMING E. B. BACKS AT HOME- THE ISSUE IS CLIENT SELECTION. AND I THINK OVER ALL LICENSED MIDWIVES TAKE GREAT CARE IN- THEY'RE SELECTING AS CLIENTS AND TO THEIR RETAIN US CLIENTS THAT THE CONDITION ARISES. AND SO THAT'S HOW THE PRACTICE. INDEPENDENTLY IS THAT- THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LEGISLATION AND SO THEY CAN'T TAKE ON CASES WHERE THERE'S- AND IT YOU MORE THAN THAN. THEN WHY FEEDER- DATE CAN'T BE BURIED. THEY HAVE TO. YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS PERIOD DELIVERIES EXPECT THAT GO OVER OR OR BE TREAT- ANDS. YOUR DAY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE STATE OF CARE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE MAKING GET THIS ABOUT CLIENTS. AND CURRENTLY NOT REGULAR THAT FURTHER THE FINAL- THE YOU KNOW THE POOR HAS NOT. A POSITION ON FOR SURE BE BACK NUMBER LICENSED MIDWIVES IN THE HOME INSIDE AND I'M TO COME WHAT BOARD BECAUSE TODAY IN THAT REGARD OKAY THAT IS UP TO THE BY JUST TO. IN YOU FURTHER TO NOT AND IN THE PORT OF COURSE THIS AND- IT. WELL IN ON THAT ONCE THERE'S LANGUAGE AVAILABLE WITH YOU I MAY HAVE SOME OTHER FOR LET ME TO FOR TO MY CAN MEMBERS DR WEBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR THE COMP. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AROUND A MIDWIFE- AS PRACTICING A- I ENTER THE TIME. THAT WE ARE TO TODAY- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE. YOU KNOW THE BACKS VAGINAL BIRTH THAT SEASON IT'S BEEN AT DEBATE FOR A LONG TIME. AS TO THE SAFETY WERE NOT A SAFE AND WHERE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT- AND HOW MANY TIMES IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE C. SECTIONS- HOW OFTEN WILL THAT YOU HAVE A FEEDBACK FOR TEN THIRTY BACK AFTER THAT- AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SAFE TO HAVE SOMEONE. DELIVER VAGINALLY AFTER THEY'VE HAD A C. SECTION AT HOME ON WHERE THEY'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO BE MONITORED SO. THESE ARE DEFINITELY ONGOING- DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN THE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TO UPDATE SOME OF OUR BUSINESS CODE IN PROFESSIONS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WE UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY IN THE REALM OF OBGYN THERE IS NO QUOTE NORMAL. PREGNANCY BECAUSE THINGS CAN CHANGE- AND I AN INSTANT SOMEONE CAN COME IN WITH NO MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS OF HAD A PREFABRICATED NORMAL. THIRTY NINE WEEKS AND THEN COME ON TO LABOR AND DELIVERY AND ABRUPT. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN- IN A VERY VERY QUICK. TIME FRAME FOR THE. MOST ON- I. OF PATIENT THAT HAD BUT WE ALSO WANT TO AND TO GIVE OUR PATIENTS OPTION. AND THAT THERE IS. IN PRACTICE- AN OBGYN AND I MIDDLE SIR- MASSANA I SAID I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSS THESE IS SO THAT WE CAN FOR. OUR PATIENTS WITH OPTIONS BETTER SAFE THAN THAT WE END UP HAVING SAFE MOTHERS AND SAFE BABIES THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS TELL MY PATIENTS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE WANT IS FOR A SAFE MOMMY AND SAFE BABY AND FOR EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO GO HOME AT THE SAME TIME- I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AND I UNDERSTAND. THE DESIRE TO- CREATE A SEPARATE BOARD AND THAT MAY. HAPPEN AND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. BUT WITH THE TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THERE WAS A- I MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS NO. LIKE MIDWIFE ON THERE WAS THERE EVER ANY THOUGHT TO CHANGE IT OVER TO LIKE MAYBE A STANDING COMMITTEE OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU DO. HAVE THE INPUT. OF SOMEONE FROM THE MIDWIFERY COMMUNITY. TO HELP. FLESH OUT SOME OF THESE I AM. VERY INTRICATE SIDE. THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T PRACTICE OF STATICS MAY NOT UNDERSTAND. RIGHT AND THIS IS KERRY WEBER AGAIN AND- THE TOPS FOR. THAT YOU'RE TALKING OF. AB DE MADE UP OF. TWO BOARD FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD CHIEF BOARD MEMBER. BUT WHEN THE- FORCE MET- DOES MEETING INCLUDED AND OF MIDWIVES THAT ARE IN THE CAN- REPRESENTATIVES A COG AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM CMA TO TRY TO CRAFT LANGUAGE THAT- COULD AVOID OP. AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE VILLAGE. AND- MANY MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT FOLLOWING THAT MEETING. SUCH LANGUAGE WAS CREATED HOWEVER- THERE WERE CERTAIN FACTIONS THAT WORKED TO- OPPOSE IT AND SO THE FIX WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOARD'S LAST SUNSET HILL- IT WAS DISAPPOINTING- BUT WERE ALWAYS HELPFUL THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THIS AREA BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE GAVE MIDWIVES THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY AND- YEAH WE NEED TO HAVE. THE TOOLS IN PLACE SAID BIDS CAN BE DONE EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY AND RECOGNIZE THEM AS- THE INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONERS THAT THEY ARE- BUT- AND TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO CONSULT- WITH PHYSICIANS IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY- I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS SAID MIDWIFERY ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT MEETS THREE TIMES A YEAR AND- INTERACTS WITH THE BOARD DURING BOARD MEETINGS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD FOR LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES BUT THE STRUCTURE- IT HAS ITS DIFFICULTIES FOR THE REASONS THAT I'VE- SAID BEFORE. MAKING WELL THANK YOU LETTER SAID I LOW FORWARD PROTECT IN DISCUSSIONS- AND HOW WE CAN UPDATE OUR OWN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE- SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW YOU KNOW LICENSED MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY SAFELY- AS THE LEGISLATIVE PREVIOUSLY- ALLOW FOR IT THIS TOOK OTHER QUICK THINGS- YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA. ECHO WITH MY OTHER COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS REMOVING YOU KNOW- THE STIGMA AROUND MENTAL HEALTH- IT'S NOT- JUST SOMETHING THAT WE SEE WITH COVERT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME WE HAVE- PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO A PRO ACTIVELY SEEK CARE WITHOUT BEING FEARED WITH SOME KIND OF RETRIBUTION OR SOME STIGMA THEN WE WILL DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. OR- BORN FRENCH HORN FOR MY STATE BEFORE THERE'S A VERY HIGH RATE OF. AMONG PHYSICIANS AND SO THAT ULTIMATELY IS TO. DECREASE ACCESS FOR USUALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND THE OTHER THING I'M JUST WONDERING IS WHEN YOU ALL COME BACK IF YOU CAN GIVE ME A SCOPE OF THE ISSUE OF THE- MOONLIGHTING- FOR OUR OUR TRAINEES YOU KNOW AS A RESIDENT- I STARTED RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF THE SWITCH OF THE EIGHTY HOUR. WORK WEEK REQUIREMENT AND SO WE WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO DO MORE LIGHTING AND I KNOW OUR RESIDENTS THAT I'VE MOST RECENTLY WORKED WITH. ARE UNABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'M IT WOULD GO OVER WORK. ON OUR REQUIREMENTS. ON THE EIGHTY HOUR WORK WEEK RULE. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF WHEN YOU COME BACK IF YOU CAN KIND OF GIVE ME- I HAD. SOME KIND OF SCOPE OF THE ISSUE OF HOW MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE STILL ABLE AND DESIRING TO DO MOONLIGHTING SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE WEBER THOSE AND- A RUMOR. I JUST FROM PURSE. ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE I. LOOKING FOR MIKE'S BEFORE I ASK YOU TO COMPLETE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. I HAVE NOT REVIEWED THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF AB THIRTEEN AWAIT AND I CERTAINLY WILL DIFFER ON MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER COLLEAGUES- AND THOSE RELATED TO THEM FOR. ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE ON THIS BUT IF THE STATUTE ITSELF CONTEMPLATED THE ISSUANCE OF REGULATIONS. ON THIS MATTER IN ORDER TO INFORM LICENSE MIDWIVES WHEN THEY PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY AND AT LEAST IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE STATUTE WAS ENACTED AND WE HAVEN'T ISSUED REGULATIONS. ON THIS. REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF GUIDANCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT AND EITHER THE MEDICAL BOARD'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. IN THIS SUNSET REVIEW REVIEW BILL OR OTHERWISE TO FURTHER DEFINE THIS ISSUE SO THAT LICENSED MIDWIVES AND PHYSICIANS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS KNOW WHAT THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS. AND CAN BE GUIDED BY IT. SO CENTER TOTALLY SEE YOUR MAKE UP PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ADD. TO THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AT THE- MY COLLEAGUES AT ASTOR LOOTED EARLIER THIS MORNING AND IT REALLY WANT TO ECHO- AT IT MIGHT GET COLLEAGUES FROM AT THE ASSEMBLY THAT DOCTOR WEBER AND- SPEAKING TO. M. MIDWIFERY HOW ABOUT HOW IT'S ABOUT SAFE MOTHERS AND SAFE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE BABIES I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND SOME QUESTIONS IN IN THIS AREA- THE FIRST- I DID LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND AN INFORMATION GATHERING. AND I HAVE A NUMBER OF FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO LICENSED MIDWIVES THAT- WERE AT LEAST EXPECTED TO REPORT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THERE IS NO REPORT OF FOUR TWENTY TWENTY BUT- YOU KNOW FIRST I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THIS NUMBER IS MORE OR LESS ACCURATE- I ALSO WANT TO. AB IT YOU KNOW KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT IT WHAT WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE PER COUNTY- I KNOW THAT IN MY A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW DIGGING THROUGH INFORMATION- FOR EXAMPLE IN MARIN COUNTY THERE'S- TWENTY. THAT NUMBER OF LIVE BIRTHS AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD PRETTY GOOD YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD OUTCOMES AT LEAST TWO THE REPORT THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN- BUT I WAS WONDERING IF WE HAVE MORE DEMOGRAPHICS OF. YOU KNOW OF THAT INTO THAT REPORT- AND ALSO WHAT I ALSO FOUND A LITTLE BIT- ALARMING I WOULD SAY IS. I'D BE INFORMATION ON- THE TRANSFER OF CARE. OF ELDERLY CHART AND OR A CLIENT- YOU KNOW SHORTLY BE- AT VBAC AB BACK AND I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT YOU KNOW THE V. G. Y. AND R. DR JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT- OUT YET THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE CLIENTS THAT HAD DEVELOPED. HYPERTENSION DURING THE PREGNANCY AND HAD TO BE THAT THERE THERE ARE CARE HAD TO BE TRANSFERRED. AND THERE WAS A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE CLIENTS AND F. SHORTLY BEFORE- YOU KNOW DELIVERY. I THERE WAS ALL. INTO TRANSFER CARE AT IN ISSUES LIKE YOU PROLONGED RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES AND- AND THAT HAD YOU KNOW WHAT THE UMBER IS MUCH HIGHER THERE WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW THE RECORD CAME UP. SO I THINK THAT THIS THIS. I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT ITS OWN ESTABLISHING ITS OWN- BOARD GIVEN FACT. THERE COULD BE COMPLICATIONS RIGHT- IT COULD BE YOUR PRIOR TO OR DURING. I DON'T REALLY KNOW TOO MUCH BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT- THERE'S REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE- AT THE PATIENT AND THE CARE- AND THERE SEEMS TO BE KIND OF TO KIND OF TWO STANDARDS. NOT TO. APPS NOT TO STANDARDS OF CARE BUT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT- A PRACTICE ACTS THAT- THAT THAT HAVE TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW NOBODY OBGYN- ABIDES BY ONE- PRACTICE ACTING IN THE MIDWIFERY AT. ABIDES BY DIFFERENT ONE SO- SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE COMMENT OR OR PROVIDE AN ANSWER ON- MY STATEMENT PLEASE. I'M HAPPY TO COMMENT ON THAT CENTER HER CHINA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- YOU KNOW THE TRANSFER OF CARE. THAT TELLS US THAT MIDWIVES ARE ACTING APPROPRIATELY THAT IS PRETTY CONDITION ARISES THAT IS BEYOND THEIR SCOPE THEY ARE SENDING THAT PERSON TO THE HOSPITAL AND- YOUR THAT THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT- AS- DOCTOR WEB SAID- THESE KIDS- IT'S YOU HAVE A CLAIM THAT THAT FALLS WITHIN THE LICENSED MIDWIFE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. AND SOMETHING TO DURING THE COURSE OF THE DELIVERY AND SO THE MIDWIFE APPROPRIATELY SINCE THE PERSON TO THE HOSPITAL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO AND SO THE BOARD DOESN'T CONSIDER THAT IN AND OF ITSELF NEGATIVE- OF COURSE QUESTIONS ARISE. IF THEY ACTED WITHIN THE STANDARD OF CARE ON THE TINY OF THE TRANSFER SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE SOONER- SHE WAS A SENATE APPROPRIATE CLIENTS TO TAKE BOND TO BEGIN WITH OR TO KEEP IT THE CONDITION AROSE. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MAKING TRANSFERS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO IF SOMETHING CHANGES STAND. SHOULD SAFETY REQUIRE THAT. AND AS A FOLLOW- THE MIDWIFERY ACT AUTHORIZES AUTHORIZES A LICENSE FEE TO ATTEND CASES OF NORMAL PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH- SO HOW DOES IT MEAN IT KINDA JUST SEEMS TO. KIND OF CONTRADICT ITSELF IF THERE'S A IF A PREGNANCY CAN HAVE A COMPLICATION AND IT WOULD IN AND MANY DO- DOESN'T THAT KIND OF CONTRACT DICT BE ACTED ITSELF. WELL IT. GOES ON TO FURTHER DEFINE NORMAL PREGNANCY AS SAYING THAT THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING ANY PRE EXISTING MATERNAL DISEASE OR CONDITION LIKELY TO AFFECT THE PREGNANCY AND THAT'S THAT LANGUAGE THAT I REFERRED TO BEFORE AS- BEING A SECOND. POINT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE TERMS ME OR- A SIGNIFICANT THE Z. IS A- FROM THE PREGNANCY- SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE. THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU HELP THE BOARD IDEALLY- I'M RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING- TO WORKER. THIS LANGUAGE- TO GET CLEAR BECAUSE THE BOARD- THE IN CLEAR TO GO FOR WITH THE RADIO ON THE- AND DOES ARE. THOSE ARE CONCERNS YES AS WHAT TO EXPECT OF US- WORKING CLASS. WITH A MET WITH THEM. THANK YOU AND MY SECOND QUESTION- DEAL WITH IT INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL SO I KNOW PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY THE MEDICAL RECORD THE MEDICAL BOARD RECOGNIZED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTY SIX INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL SCHOOLS- FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S NO- THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN A REASSESSMENT OF THOSE. SCHOOLS THAT WERE- I RECOGNIZE I WANTED TO KIND OF GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT WHAT THAT TIME FRAME- FOR A RECOGNIZING IT I MEAN TWO THOUSAND A SCHOOLS MORE ALAS. WHAT WAS THE TIME FRAME OF GIVING THEM RECOGNITION AND WHAT WERE SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION OR OR CRITERIA. FOR APPROVAL AND- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAS BEEN THE OUTCOME. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT AS WELL- WITH THE SHIFT TO THE POST TRAINING MICE REQUIRE THREE OPPOSED GRADUATE. THE. BOARD ASKED IN THE LEGISLATURE SHE HOW THE BOARD APPROVE. MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND SO NOW THE SCHOOL. IS ON. THAT WORLD HEALTH BUT- ON FAMER LIST. IT IS. RECOGNIZE THE BOARD NO LONG GOES TO A HI INDEPENDENT. TO REVIEW AND APPROVE. A PRIOR TO THAT. THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT STRUCTURES. FOUR ONE FOUR AND NONPROFIT SCHOOLS WHERE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO EDUCATE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY TO PRACTICE IN THAT COUNTRY. AND THE ONE WAS FOR PROFIT SCHOOL WHERE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY OF YOUR FOR PURPOSES THAT BAND. GOING ANYWHERE TO PRACTICE AND SO THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS REQUIRED A MUCH MORE INTENSIVE REVIEW- TO ENSURE THAT IT MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BOARD- THERE'S YOUR L. OF BLOOD A DETAIL WE NEED TO WHICH HAPPY TO GO OVER IF YOU WANT TO- IT'S JUST THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE BOARD'S PROCESS. RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WELL WHEN DID THIS PRACTICE OF BEGAN. I JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY WAS SAID WHEN THERE IS A SHIFT TO POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSES AT NO LONGER GOING TO THEIR- THE CREW WILL PROCESS FOR SCHOOL. PRIOR TO THAT WHEN DID IT SEEMS LIKE B. B. INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS- WERE RECOGNIZED THE PROGRAM ENDED IN TWENTY TWENTY BUT WHEN DID IT BEGIN. OH MY GOSH I AM. WAY BEFORE ANY OF OUR TIME HERE- IT. STATE SENATE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SCHOOL CENTER IF IT WAS RIGHT BACK DECADES. AND HOW MANY OF THE SCHOOLS ARE STILL RECOGNIZED. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT RIGHT RIGHT THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT I WOULD SUSPECT THAT. ALL OF THEM WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WITH THE CURRENT PROCESS- BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE FOR RECOGNIZING SCHOOLS AND THAT AND THAT'S THE POINT- IT MORE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO QUALIFY FOR LICENSURE. AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT THE BOARD DID- OF REASSESSMENT. I'M SORRY NOT A REASSESSMENT MY APOLOGIES SO UP THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE IN REGARDS TO THIS IS THAT PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY HOW MANY U. S. OR CANADIAN SCHOOLS APPLIED FOR A RECOGNITION. HOW MANY WERE APPROVED AND HOW MANY WERE DENIED. US OR CANADIAN SCHOOLS YES- DOES THE BOARD APPROVES IF THEY'RE ACCREDITED BY. THE BETTER L. C. N. B. SO THAT THAT THAT'S A LEVINE AGENCIES THAT- THE BOARD RELIES ON SO DID WE HAVE OR DID WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PROCESS IN PLACE FOR. APPROVAL PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. SPOHR INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL SCHOOLS YES BUT SAID PROCESS HASN'T CHANGED FOR U. S. OR CANADIAN SCHOOLS. OKAY AND. CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S FOR THAT THE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OVERSEES IT INCLUDES THE APPLE THE POST GRADUATE MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDY BY NON CITIZENS- DID YOU KNOW WHAT DINA- CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF AN AMC TO A SPONSORED INTERNATIONAL POSITION A PARTICIPATION FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM NONCITIZENS. I GUESS CA IN REGARDS TO THESE FOUR DIFFERENT SPECIAL PROGRAMS- HOW MANY HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW GIVEN OUT AND IN YOUR VIEW WHAT HAVE BEEN THE BENEFITS OF THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. PARDON I'M GONNA TURN THAT OVER TO MARINO CONNOR CHIEF OF LICENSING. I THINK YOU UNDER LOOKING THE NUMBERS JUST TO SEE HOW MANY CURRENTLY HVE- THEY'RE JUST JUST. ONE IN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY. WE HAD TWENTY FOUR SPECIAL FACULTY PERMITS ISSUED SELECT UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE TWENTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT. WE FIND THE OTHER. AND IF NOT THAT I MEAN THAT'S OKAY WE I COULDN'T YOU CAN PER THAT INFORMATION TO ME AT A DIFFERENT TIME I DON'T WANT TO HOLD EVERYONE UP AND COMMITTEE. BOB YEAH OKAY I I'LL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO THOSE NUMBERS GREAT THANK YOU AND HAVE JUST TWO QUICK QUESTIONS SHOULD BE THE LAST THE LAST ONES- AT. IT NOW MY NEXT QUESTION IS REGARDS TO THIS FOR PERMITS- THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO US SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE- HOW ARE YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE ENSURING THE QUALITY OF ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS A SPONSOR INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE SPECIAL FACT. FACULTY PERMIT PROGRAM. SO RIGHT NOW- WE HAD WE THERE'S SPECIFIC CRITERIA SET OUT STATUTES FOR HOW THE- ORGANIZATION WILL. YOU KNOW QUALIFY AS A ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER SO THERE'S ONLY ONE ORGANIZATIONS THUS FAR THAT HAS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER AND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THEM. ON AND MAKING SURE THEY CAN PROVIDE THE DOCUMENTATION TO SHOW THAT THEY MEET THOSE CRITERIA IN STATUTE. AND THE LAST QUESTION- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD RECEIVES ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR LICENSING AND RENEWAL CYCLE TOWARDS THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION. FUND THAT THAT. GOES TO THE PROGRAM THE STEPHEN M. THOMPSON FOUNDATION LONG REPAYMENT PROGRAM. IT'S THAT THE PROGRAM ENCOURAGES NEW PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE AND LOW INCOME UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- DO YOU HAVE MORE LESS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH MONEY IS RAISED OUT OF THOSE FEES AND- AND HOW MUCH IS RAISED OUT OF CONTRIBUTIONS. OR DONATIONS. I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME NO BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY GET THAT FOR YOU OKAY BUT THAT IS IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER HER TADO CENTER LEGAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING I HAD A QUESTION SURROUNDING A PTL THE POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSURE- SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS. TO ME ABOUT- PTL AND IT BEING INCONSISTENT WITH FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICIES SPECIFICALLY- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE THREE POLICIES WERE ADOPTED. TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF RESIDENTS. HOWEVER THE STRICT COMPLETION OF THE TIMELINE ON LICENSURE- DOES NOT ALLOW RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO ARE. IN NEED FOR THE CONTEMPLATING HAVING CHILDREN TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR LICENSURE WITHOUT DELAYING FELLOWSHIP AND JOBS START STATE SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE IS. IF YOU MISS A FEW MONTHS- WHATEVER THE AMOUNT OF TIME IS YOU HAVE TO ADD IT ON TO THE END. COULD YOU. TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IF THAT IS TRUE AND IF IT IS TRUE WHAT THE- WHAT THE PURPOSES. IF I COULD. OKAY SORRY HOWARD AT THIS KRAUSE. I IT'S CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN THE INTENT TO THE MEDICAL MORE AND TO SOMEONE WHO'S DOING AN EXTRA. THREE YEAR RESIDENTS. DO THIRTY NINE MONTHS OF- RESIDENCY. SO THIS AGAIN IS ANOTHER ON CONSEQUENCE LIKE THAT MOONLIGHTING ISSUE. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED HI AND CERTAINLY IF SOMEONE HAS MET ACGME REQUIREMENTS AND HAS COMPLETED THREE YEARS OF POST GRADUATE TRAINING WHICH WAS INCLUSIVE OF THEIR TIME OFF FOR THE JOURNAL NEEDS ARE OTHER HEALTH NEEDS. IT REALLY IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD TO WORK COURSE THEM IN THEIR PROGRAMS TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL THREE MONTHS EFFORT RESIDENCY TRAINING. SECOND COLLABORATION WITH THAT WITH OTHERS ALL RIGHT IT'S OUR INTENT TO SEE THIS PROBLEM BE FIXED. WELL THAT'S GREAT NEWS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA FOR RAISING THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE- MEMBER FONG. BUT THE CARE ROTH ENSURE LOW- I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LESSONS AND I BELIEVE MY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO- ALSO BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP EARLY BUT I JUST WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AS WELL I RESENTED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE- POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE THE MEDICAL BOARD. WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ENSURE PTL RESIDENTS COULD SIT MOONLIGHT WITHOUT IMPACTING MEDICARE REIMBURSES I THINK THERE WAS A ALLUSION TO THAT THIS ISSUE- IN THE PREVIOUS ANSWER FORTY THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT IS CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED WITH ACCESS TO RURAL HEALTH CARE AND PREVENT AND PREVENTING RESIDENTS FROM BUILDING MEDICAL- IN. HEALTH CENTER IS JUST AN BARRIER. TO WADA SPACE. SOLUTIONS ARE IS THE- TO FOR. TO FIX THIS ISSUE AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE RICHEST FROM G. HE. YES- THIS IS MARINO CONNOR I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- RIGHT AS WE HAD MENTIONED WE HAD MET WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- TO YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ISSUE WAS- WITH NOT RECOGNIZING DETAILS- AS AN ABLE TO. A QUALIFY FOR- PAYMENT OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS- IT WAS- IT WAS BROUGHT TO US THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE PTL WAS- CONSIDERED A RESTRICTED LICENSE- SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH- VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS- CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS- YOU KNOW. ALL WORKING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THERE'S ANY POSSIBLE WAY- IT WHETHER IT WAS A LOT CHANGE- OR ANY ANY KIND OF CLARIFICATION THE BOARD COULD PROVIDE- TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN RESOLVE THIS- AND WE HAD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM I BELIEVE THERE ARE. THERE WAS EVEN SOME- LANGUAGE PROPOSED AND WE WERE LOOKING AT IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SEE IF THAT WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE BUT- THEY DID NOT APPEAR THAT THAT WAS GOING TO RESOLVE IT- ACCORDING TO DH CS- SO YOU KNOW WE JUST CONTINUE TO. TRY TO FIND AVENUES FORWARD- YOU KNOW AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE YOU KNOW HOW BEST TO RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE- AND IT NEEDS TO BE A NEED TO BE RESOLVED. SO IF YOU DO MIND- FOLLOW I GUESS MMHM MAYBE CAN CUT OF DEVIL DEEPER- I UNDERSTAND IT IS TOP. AND TRYING TO OUT THE SOLUTION BUT WHAT ARE THE PROS. IS WHAT. D. H. C. S. PROPOSED WOULD HAS THE MEDICAL. BOARD PROPOSED- COMMITTEE IS THE GULF BETWEEN THE TWO THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS PRETTY LARGE FOR A WE CLOSE TO SOMETHING IS ARE SOME COMMON GROUND HERE. YEAH I MEAN WHAT WE'VE LOOKED AT IS- IS IT A MATTER OF- YOU KNOW HOW IN THE LOT. WE DEFINE WHAT OPPOSE GREATER TRAINING LICENSES AS FAR AS ITS EQUIVALENTS TO A FULL AND UNRESTRICTED PHYSICIANS. LICENSE SO- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF ME BUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED BUSINESS SOME WAY WE CAN WORD IT. SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME. ROUGHLY THE SAME- AND DISCREPANCY THAT THEY CAN STILL PRACTICE- YOU KNOW MEDICINE IN THE SAME SKILL. JUSTWITHIN THEIR THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAM- SO YOU KNOW WE WE'RE WE'VE WE'VE- TRYING TO FIND- WORKING WITH DH CS WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO WHAT OTHER LANGUAGE WE CAN PROPOSE- YOU KNOW WHERE. THEY WOULD CONSIDER A PTL AN UNRESTRICTED. LICENSE OKAY. TO ADD TO YES. WE'VE BEEN BLINDS. BY THIS ISSUE. HI THIS STATE OF THE- WE'RE ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO YOU- TEN TO. OTHER STATES. THAT ALL REQUIRE THAN YEAR COURSE GRADUATE TRAINING. HI AND DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME MOONLIGHTING ISSUE. WITH THAT T. OF OUR DISCOVERY IS TO LEARN HOW THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AVOIDED OR OVERCOME AND IN OTHER STATES AND HOPEFULLY TO BE ABLE TO. INSTITUTE THE SAME PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO I I'D LIKE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED OR EXACERBATED WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW THE CENTER VALLEY WHICH IS OUR OUR HEALTHCARE SHOULD- PERSONNEL SHORTAGE. AND SO- I CERTAINLY AM AND WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY AND I APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ANY SPECIFICS- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. THANK YOU OF MEMBER FONG.

IN A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE IMPACTING ACCESS TO CARE THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS PROVIDE THAT MEDICAID PROVIDERS MUST NOT HAVE CURRENT LIMITATIONS ON THEIR LICENSES AND AS NOTED IN YOUR COMMITTEE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT. THE PPL IS INTENDED TO BE AN UNRESTRICTED LICENSE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ACT.

THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. WE HAVE LINE NUMBER FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SURE MEMBERS TO MADDEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS I LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME INTO RIGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS ON THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE ISSUES AS WELL AS THE COMMENTS TODAY FROM BOTH MEMBERS AS WELL AS FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY AROUND THIS MEASURE. WE ALONG WITH THE OTHER GROUPS THAT JUST I'VE SPOKEN ARE CONCERNED WITH THE MULTIPLE ISSUES RELATED TO THE POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE QUICKLY FOCUS ON TO WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON MOOD LIGHTING AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN AN X. WAIVER. FOR EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESIDENTS AFTER THEIR FIRST TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK SHIFTS THAT OTHER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS URGENT CARE CENTERS OR CLINICS OVER THE REMAINING THREE YEARS OF THE WRENCHING RESIDENCY PROGRAMS MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE STARTING AT SIGNIFICANT WITH SIGNIFICANT STUDENT LOANS AND THEIR INCOME. FROM RESIDENTS HE DOESN'T GO VERY FAR. HAS THE ADDITIONAL IMPACT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS WHO ARE WANTING TO WORK SHIFTS. THAT ARE MANY TIMES DIFFICULT FOR HOSPITALS URGENT CARE CENTERS AND CLINICS. TO FIND POSITIONS TO COVER. TO PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE THIRD TWENTY TWO EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WITH ROUGHLY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESIDENTS I'M PARTICIPATING IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO THESE ARE ALL FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO WORK. IN THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DO AT THIS TIME THE SECOND ISSUE WE HAVE IS WITH THE- OBTAINING AN EX WEBER HAS MENTIONED WE'VE APPLIED. AND BEEN REJECTED FROM SAMPSON ONE OF PLANNING FOR THE X. WAIVER- THIS IS BECOME A AND A COMMON IMPORTANT TOOL ALLOWING EMERGENCY MEDICINE. PHYSICIANS TO START PATIENTS ON MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR THE PERSON'S ADDICTION CHALLENGES THIS RESTRICTION LIMITS THE ABILITY TO RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE CARE TO PATIENTS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH THEY'RE WORKING AND TRAINING AND ALL ALSO REPRESENTS ANOTHER BARRIER TO MOOD LIGHTING. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE ASKING THE POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE TO BE RESCINDED. AND WE'RE VERY THANKFUL OF YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU JUST A AS A NOTE FOR THOSE WAITING ON THE LINE WE- HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WAITING IN THAT NUMBER TENDS TO GROW I'M PRETTY LIBERAL IN TERMS OF ALLOWING.

AND I COULD NOT OBTAIN MEDICAL CARE I WOULD UNITE CARE. FOR THREE YEARS. I DID NOT REPORT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD COULD I WOULD FALL INTO THE YELLOWSTONE AT TEN THOUSAND I'M HEARD CASES. SO IT'S CONCERNING THAT WE HAVE NOWHERE TO TURN THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY FOR ME TO TURN IN CALIFORNIA. A MEDICAL BOARD BOARD BLAMES LEGISLATORS FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS SAYING IT'S A LAW THAT RESTRICTS THEM. AND ALSO YOU ARE APPOINT PEOPLE TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO ADVOCATE FOR MICRO. SAYS THAT DOING A PREDATOR TO THE MIRACLE MEDICAL BOARD THEY CALLED ME HOMELESSNESS POVERTY EMOTIONAL ANGUISH AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE OVER MY CRUSH BUT IT'S OKAY FOR THE PEOPLE TO THE BOARD. INSTEAD TO DOCTORS THAT HAVE BENEFITTED INTEREST IN PATIENT SAFETY AND ADVOCACY. REMOVE THE MEMBERS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES IT WILL MEMBERS EQUAL MEMBERS A PUBLIC PERSON DOCTORS.

THANK YOU RIGHT CENTER ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN STRYCHNINE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO LICENSE PLATE WITH REPORTS ON MULTIPLE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY AND AS MENTIONED ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. LIKE MIDWIVES AUTHORIZED TO PRACTICE ABOUT POSITION TO PROVISIONS LIKE MIDWIVES ARE GRANTED INDEPENDENT PRACTICE THEY ARE REGULATED AS THEY ARE TODAY BY THE MEDICAL BOARD USED TO WITH ME WITH REVISED WE COMMITTEE. AT THAT TIME STAKEHOLDERS AGREED TO EXPAND THIS GOAL BECAUSE THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD RETAIN REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVERSIGHT OF THE PROFESSION. WELL LIFE MIDWIVES MAY HAVE BEEN IN A TORTILLA THE PRACTICE OF MIDWIFERY CAN AND DOES SIGNIFICANTLY IN IRAQ WITH THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. ESPECIALLY WHEN PATIENTS REQUIRE TRANSFER TO THE NATION'S IN HOSPITALS PREPARED AS BEYOND THEIR TRAINING AND COMPETENCE. BASED ON THIS UNDERSTANDING ACRE CONTENT ESTABLISHING THE INDEPENDENT BOARD COLLECTIONS IS WHITE AT THIS TIME SHOULD NOT BE CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT A CONCURRENT REVIEW OF THE QUALIFICATIONS AND SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR LICENSED MIDWIVES. THAT PROTECTS PATIENTS AND PER THE COURT BY THE PRACTICE WE SIT BETWEEN POSITIONS IN MY MIDWIVES. JUST LAST YEAR A PUBLIC DILIGENTLY WITH A CERTIFIED NURSE CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES FUND SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN DIED WITH REVIEW NURSE MADE WITH MIDLIFE SCULPTING GRANTED THEM A LEVEL INDEPENDENCE WITHIN A SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK AND WHEN TO COLLABORATE WITH PHYSICIANS INCLUDING ATTORNEY TO BE FACTS. WE BELIEVE SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN WAS PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE CAN BE A MODEL IN RELATED COLLECTIONS MIDWIVES. AS WELL FOR ALL THESE REASONS A COGNOS SUPPOSED THE SON PRICE ELECTIONS MIDWIFERY BOARD THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. WHY NOT. THIRTY THAT'S FINE NUMBER THERE WE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS MORE- I AM TO OUR THE IN CREATING A BE PLACED INTO THE QUESTIONS NUMBER THREE BY BEING IN THE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA SUNSET DEL. THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE. WE HAVE NUMBER FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I MY NAME IS MONIQUE I AM FROM BIG AND I'M WITH THE FOR PATIENTS THAT BY REPRESENTATIVES ARE SENATE I'M- COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR MELISSA HURTADO AND ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY SALAS. THE BOARD PAID FOR ALL OF THE TRANSITION COSTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PROSECUTIONS FOR LICENSE TO RENDER REDEDICATION AND PROBATION WHAT OTHER BOARDS INCLUDING THE DENTAL BOARD AND THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING WE COVER THOSE COSTS. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE BOARD TO IMPLEMENT COST RECOVERY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ALSO APPROVE% THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION FOR LICENSING FEE INCREASE. THE FINES WOULD ELIMINATE FINANCING AS AN EXCUSE FOR THE BOARD'S FAILURES THEY WOULD ALSO REDUCE ENFORCEMENT TIMELINES BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR LICENSE YOU TO DRAG OUT AND REASONABLE AND HELPS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. WE HAVE LINE NUMBER SIXTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU HI MY NAME'S NICOLE ORIGINALLY AND I'M CALLING TO ASK THAT THE LANGUAGE CREATING A LICENSED MIDWIFE BOARD BE INCLUDED. IN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA REVIEW FOUND THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. WE HAVE A LINE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CENTER ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CENTER FOR AS MEMBERS IS VERY AND SAN BERNADINO COUNTY AND A CONSTITUENT OF SOME OF THE WILK. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR FAMILY ANOTHER PATIENT WHO SUFFERED HARM DUE TO MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE FAIRNESS FOR YOUR PATIENCE FACT. TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS. ON THE A POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE KEY. ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER JORDAN ONE MONTH SHY OF GRADIENT BIRTHDAY AND TWO MONTHS BEFORE HER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. DIED AS AN EGREGIOUS MEDICAL ARE RESULT OF EGREGIOUS MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE CAUSED BY AN UNLICENSED MEDICAL STUDENTS. IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT THAT STUDENTS WOULD HAVE HELD A PCL. WORKING WITH DIAGNOSED WITH BLOOD CLOTS BY THIS UNLICENSED MEDICAL STUDENT. SHE HAD BLOOD CLOTS IN HER ABDOMEN. AND INSTEAD OF REQUESTING CONSULATES AS HE SHOULD HAVE HE CALLED IN MEDICAL STATUS TWO ATTENDING PHYSICIANS WHO MAY HAVE NOT BEEN ON PREMISES. IN VIOLATION OF THE ACGME AND HOSPITAL POLICY. HE WAS A STUDENT IN AN ACCREDITED PROGRAM. IN A LICENSED FACILITY DID NOT PROVIDE ANY OVERSIGHT TO OUR DAUGHTER. JORDAN'S BLOOD CLOTS WERE IN HER VEINS TO HER LABOR THE VEINS TO HER SPLEEN WITH A HISTORY OF A LARGE PLANE FOR THREE YEARS. THEY WERE ALSO IN THE VEINS TO HER INTESTINES. SHE ALSO HAD INDICATIONS OF CIRRHOSIS. AND SEVERE INFECTION THAT RESULTED TO INFECTION TRAVELING TO HER BRAIN THROUGH HER V. P. SHOT. THIS MEDICAL STUDENT FAILED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE WAS NOT SUPERVISED. AND ACCORDING TO THIS MEDICAL BOARD WAS IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW BY PRACTICING MEDICINE WITHOUT A LICENSE. NOT ONLY IN RESULT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD STATEMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT KNOWLEDGE SB SEVEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH DEVELOPED THE POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE. MEMBERS OF THIS. TODAY'S MEMBERS INDICATED THAT THEY WANTED TO ALLOW. A POST GRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE TO ACT AS AN UNRESTRICTED LICENSE AND IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF A PHYSICIAN OR A TRAINING STUDENT IS A FULLY LICENSED INDIVIDUAL WHICH NOT ONLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF A TRAINING LICENSE TO GAIN MORE EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE ON THEIR OWN. BUT IT ALSO PUTS COMMUNITIES AT RISK. ASSEMBLY COOLEY I RECALL SENATOR ARAMBULA INDICATING THAT. WE NEED MORE DOCTORS AND THAT THE UNRESTRICTED NATURE OF THE PPL WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO ME THAT MEANS THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS. DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN FOR PATIENT SAFETY FOR LESS ADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH TYPICALLY ARE OF LOWER INCOME. APOLOGIES ARE THERE IS ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY BEFORE THE PPL AND EVEN AFTER THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES HOLDERS OF THE PPL ARE NOT CONTINUING TO VIOLATE THE LAW THEY ARE NOT FULLY LICENSED NOR SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED FULLY LICENSED. THEY SHOULD REQUIRE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS. THEY SHOULD HAVE FURTHER RESTRICTIONS WITH THE ACGME WHICH REQUIRE SUPERVISION UPHOLDERS OF THE PPL. THERE MAY BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE PTO HOWEVER DON'T QUESTION YOUR REVIEW DON'T RUSH IN YOUR JUDGMENT TO ALLOW CHANGES TO MAKE THIS AN UNRESTRICTED LICENSE AS IF THEY WERE FULLY LICENSED PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT MAKING MONEY OR BEING ABLE TO BILL MEDICARE OR MEDI CAL SHOULD NOT BE A REASON TO UNRESTRICTED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. THINK OF JORDAN. JORDAN HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE. SHE HAD THE RIGHT TO BE SEEN BY A LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND MEDICAL STUDENT WHO YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE GRANTED A PTO WITH ZERO OVERSIGHT. WE NEED MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. TO BE ABLE TO. HOLD THESE INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE WE NEED TRANSPARENCY FOR HOLDING THESE INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE. WE NEED A PUBLIC MEMBER MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL BOARD SO THAT WAY WE CAN ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND NOT ALLOWING DOCTORS TO CONTINUE POLICING THEMSELVES FOR THESE ACTIONS. I WISH THAT YOU GUYS WOULD. CONSIDER. THE VIEWS ON LIFE EXPERIENCE WHETHER YOU GIVE THEM A POSTGRADUATE TRAINING LICENSE OR NOT THEY ARE NOT FULLY LICENSED. THEY ARE NOT THE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE MEDICINE WITHOUT OVERSIGHT MOONLIGHTING OR OTHERWISE. I HOPE YOU TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE YOU REMEMBER JORDAN WHEN YOU TO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AMANDA MODERATOR NOW WILL NOT A LINE NUMBER. PLEASE GO ONLINE OF A THIRTY TWO YEAR OLD COMPLAINT PLEASE.

PROBLEMS AND WHY NOTHING EVER CHANGES FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THE STATE AUDITOR HAS NEVER AUDITED THE BOARD AND THAT IS WAY OVERDUE THE BOARD ISN'T BEING A 100% TRUTHFUL WITH YOU SO HOW CAN YOU DECIDE TO GRANT FOUR MORE YEARS WITHOUT ALL THE INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION. IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR DISHONESTY DISHONESTY INVESTORS MISDIRECTION BUT NOTHING EVER CHANGES OR IMPROVES WHILE THE BOARD ALWAYS PUNCTUATE THEIR MISSION STATEMENT OF CONSUMER SAFETY THAT'S NOT THEIR MISSION IN PRACTICE WHICH IS PROVEN BY THEIR DOUBLE 4% DISCIPLINARY RATE AND THE FACT THAT 96% OF THE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THEY RECEIVE ARE CLOSED. WITHOUT INVESTIGATION REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE CAUGHT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO LITERALLY THROWING COMPLAINT IN THE TRASH THE BOARD WAIT A LOT OF MONEY AND THAT'S WHY AN AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS BEYOND NECESSARY. FOR INSTANCE THEY HAVE QUARTERLY MEETINGS IN DIFFERENT. CITIES AROUND THE STATE BUT THEY ONLY. WHAT'S PRECLUDES THE PUBLIC FROM ATTENDING. THE SANDY HOTEL THEY USED BEEN DOLLARS A DAY PARKING WE REQUESTED FACILITIES BUT IT FALLS ON DEAF EARS SOMEONE ALSO NEEDS TO AUDIT THE BOARD MEMBERS PER DIEM AS BOARD MEMBERS ARE CHARGING WAY MORE THAN OTHERS WHEN I GET A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTATION THEY ILLEGALLY SENT ME INFORMATION OTHER THAN WHAT I ASKED FOR AND THEN STOPPED RESPONDING WHEN I TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT WHAT WAS REQUESTED. THEY CLEARLY DON'T WANT ME TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THEIR GUARDIAN BEING MISUSED AGAIN AN AUDIT IS CRUCIAL SO WE CAN NARROW DOWN ALL THE WAY AT THE MEDICAL BOARD IS PULLING THE WOOL OVER THE LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC BY THEY ARE NOT BEING TRUTHFUL WITH YOU LEGISLATORS.
