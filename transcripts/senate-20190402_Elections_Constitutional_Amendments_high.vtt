AND THERE'S BEEN A REAL

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.284
INTERESTING TRYING TO EXPAND

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.253
THIS THIS PRACTICE TO THE LOCAL

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.455

REGISTERED IN COMMISSIONS.

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:45.971
AND NOW COURSE THOSE LAWS ARE

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.472
PERMISSIVE IN THE JURISDICTIONS

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.074

PUSH FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.447
THE BALLOT BUT UNFORTUNATELY

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:56.915
JERRY MANNER HAS CONTINUED AT

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.617
THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU SEE THAT IN

00:21:58.684 --> 00:22:00.052
ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS I

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.119
MEAN BY.

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.354
ONE ANALYSIS I SAW RECENTLY FROM

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:05.390
THE LEGO I REPORTED THAT -- YOU

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:06.024
KNOW.

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:07.392
THAT LATINOS ARE 40% OF STATE

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.860
BUT ONLY 10% OF COUNTY

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.630
SUPERVISORS -- BEANO OFTENTIMES

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:14.099
YOU'LL HAVE COUNTIES WHERE --

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:14.900
THE COUNTY MAY BE VERY

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.802
POLITICALLY DIVERSE BUT THE

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.336
BOARD IS DOMINATED BY ONE

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.171
POLITICAL PARTY.

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.672
AND THAT'S BECAUSE ONE PARTY OR

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:23.675
THE OTHER HAS DOMINATED THE THE

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:25.477
THE DRAWING OF THE LINES AND WE

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:33.185
ALL KNOW FROM OUR STUDY OF

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.119
NATIONAL EXAMPLES HOW.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:34.786
THE EXTREMES TO WHICH MEMBERS OF

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:35.620
BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN WILLING

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.254
TO TAKE GERRYMANDERING TO

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.323
MAXIMIZE PARTISAN ADVANTAGE.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.924
THE STATE LEGISLATURES ALREADY

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.492
PASSED BILLS TO REQUIRE LA AND

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:42.327
SAN DIEGO COUNTIES TO ADOPT

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:43.829
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH COMMISSIONS.

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.163
AND IT'S NOW OUR STRONG SENSE

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.865
THAT IS THE TIME FOR EVERY FOR

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.300
THE OTHER LARGE COUNTIES TO JOIN

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:49.334
THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.969
CONGRESS AND TAKE.

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.271
PART IS IN AT A SELF INTERESTED

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:55.874
POLITICAL GERRYMANDERING OUT.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.309
OF REDISTRICTING.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.244
SO I THOUGHT THAT'S AFFECTED

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:00.445
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT REQUIRES

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:01.680

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.215
POWER TO DRAFT.

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:04.516
AND ADOPT MAPS INDEPENDENT OF

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:05.717
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:06.985
REQUIRES THE COMMISSION MEMBERS

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.153
BE POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT AND

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.888
FOR THE FIRST TIME IT PROHIBITS

00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:11.389
PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING COUNTY

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:12.324

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.692
IT ENSURES TRANSPARENCY BY

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:14.960
REQUIRING THAT DROP MAPS THE

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:23.435
PRIOR TO ADOPTING ANY MAPS.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:24.836
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I

THAT WOULD MAKE IT HIGHLY

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.815
UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF OUR

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.650

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:51.019

WE THINK THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US --

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:56.959
NOT GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY IS FAT

01:14:57.025 --> 01:15:00.062
MATTER.

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.730
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CALIFANO FOR

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.005
FIRST OF ALL DEMOCRATS AND THE

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:13.342

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:14.843

DEBATES THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED INTO

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.018
THE DEBATES -- END OF IT.

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:24.753
SO THIS WAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.389
TO ALLOW. FOR PARTIES HAVE THEIR

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:28.824

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.525
WE DO DO THAT WE HAVE OUR

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.760
DEBATES BEFORE CONVENTION

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.595

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.801
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIES GONNA BE.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.770
THE PRIMARY ISSUES BASICALLY AS

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.605
A BEAUTY CONTEST SO THAT OUR

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.940
DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.275

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.981
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.183
THE CURRENTLY THE WAY THAT WE'VE

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.052
BEEN DOING IT IS THAT -- BASED

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.253
ON PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING OUR

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.673
OF FINAL COMMENT I'D LIKE TO

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.742
MAKE IS THAT THE CANDIDATES FROM

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.010
OTHER STATES THIS IS A MUST BE

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:57.379
REGISTERED. TO VOTE WITH THE

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.247
PEACE AND FREEDOM PARTY -- IT'S

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.984
PROBABLY ABOUT.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.185
IT DOESN'T HAVE STATES THAT

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:05.187
DON'T HAVE A REGISTRATION BY

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:05.754
PARTY.

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.422
AND SO CANDY FROM ANY OF THOSE

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:09.825
STATES WOULD BE REGISTERED IN

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:13.395
WHATEVER PARTY -- YOUR SECOND.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.130
IN THE CURRENT BATCH TO BE LIKE

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:16.331
KEEPING.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:17.766
BERNIE SANDERS OFF THE BALLOT

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.001
BECAUSE HE'S NOT REGISTERED

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.769
DEMOCRAT.

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:22.471
HE'S AN INDEPENDENT [inaudible]

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:24.272
VERMONT.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.608
ANYWAY WERE OPPOSE THE BILL --

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:29.945
WE THINK IT -- DOES HARM -- SOME

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.614
OF THE PARTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:33.181
THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GO

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:36.518
DOWN [inaudible]

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.653
GO AHEAD.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.489
I AM REGISTERED WINGER WITH

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.057
BALLOT ACCESS NEWS.

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.525
THERE'S SOME FLAWS IN THE BILL

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.827
IT COULD EASILY BE IMPROVED.

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.062
THE PART ABOUT.

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:49.398
PRIMARY SEASON MATCHING FUNDS IS

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.266
AMBIGUOUS.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.168
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ONLY TWO

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.603
PEOPLE EVEN.

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.971
QUALIFIED FOR PRIMARY SEASON

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.739
MATCHING FUNDS.

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.474
THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERIOUS

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.076
DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:03.011
IT.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.679
BECAUSE IT COMES WITH STRINGS.

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:07.582
YOU CAN'T SPEND.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.051
OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.652
IN EACH STATE IF YOU TAKE THE

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.953
MONEY.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.088
SO IT'S IT'S VIRTUALLY A DEAD

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.489
LETTER [inaudible]

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:17.592
BUT IF IT WERE [inaudible]

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.594
CLARIFIED.

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.930
YOU MEAN THE THE PERSON

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:23.598
QUALIFIES IF.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.267
THEY WERE SEEN [inaudible]

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.168
THE MONEY [inaudible]

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:29.037
YOU KNOW. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.740
FOR ME TO TWENTY STATES.

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.575
BUT THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.310
MUCH OF THAT WOULD COVER LOTS OF

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.678
CANDIDATES.

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.180
AND THIS CAME UP IN OHIO IT WAS

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.748
AMBIGUOUS.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.450
AND SO THE OHIO LEGISLATURE

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:42.684
AMENDED THE LAW AND THEY SAID

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:44.319
WELL LET ME ME WHAT WE MEAN BY

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.054
THAT IS.

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:49.791
THE CANDIDATE RAISED THE MONEY.

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.626
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:52.594
HAVE TO ASK THE FEDERAL

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.863
GOVERNMENT FOR IT.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.598
AND I WAS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.967
BILL UNTIL IT WAS AMENDED THE

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.635
DEBATES PROVISION WAS

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:00.936
[inaudible]

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:03.138
SUBSTANTIALLY TOUGHENED AND THAT

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.739
MEANS SOMEBODY IS SERIOUS IS

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.775
WILLIAM WELD FORMER GOVERNOR OF

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:07.742
MASSACHUSETTS.

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:09.211
IT WAS COMMUNICATED.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.613
AS CONCERNS TO THE SECRETARY OF

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.881
STATE.

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.883
MIGHT BE EXCLUDED.

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.420
IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN.

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:19.321
TWENTY TWENTY DOESN'T WANT TO

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.357
HOLD ANY PARTY SPONSORED DEBATE.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.025
AND THEY PROBABLY WON'T.

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.660
AS IT WON'T WANT THEM TILL JUST

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:27.529
AS THEY DIDN'T HOLD ANY DEBATES

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.431
IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THIS

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:30.198
PRESIDENT.

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.933
GEORGE H. W. BUSH DIDN'T WANT TO

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.935
DEBATE ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN HE'S

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.370
RUNNING FOR REELECTION.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.172
YOU CAN QUALIFY UNDER THE

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.741

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:42.444
WAS OKAY BEFORE BEFORE.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.812
THE LIKE WILLIAM WELD IN MAYBE

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.413
GOVERNOR CASEY COULD HAVE GOT

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.381
TOGETHER AND HAD THEIR OWN

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.383
DEBATE.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.584
THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T BE THERE

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.019
BUT SO WHAT THEY COULD HAVE

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.554
DEBATED BUT NOW IT HAS TO BE A

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.789

REPUBLICAN SPONSORED DEBATE.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.733

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.334
ON THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:08.136
PRIMARY BALLOT.

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:10.038
ALL HE'S GOT LEFT IS THAT HE

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.373

BUT YOU HAVE TO SATISFY TOO AND

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.446
HE COULD ONLY SATISFY.

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.649

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.684

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.619
THE OLD LAW WAS TOO VAGUE BUT

01:20:24.686 --> 01:20:27.789

BILL FROM CENTER JACKSON HAVE

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:17.185
BEEN.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:21.122
QUITE SUCCESSFUL WE HAD OVER

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.723

THE BILL TODAY.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:28.663
TRYING TO SOLVE ONE TECHNICAL

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.898
ISSUE THAT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:31.599
WITH AN AGE THRESHOLD BUT IT'S

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.001
REALLY ABOUT A DMV FORM.

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.402
WHEN YOU'RE FIFTEEN AND A HALF

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:35.170

DL?

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:38.540
FORTY FOUR AND THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.575
THAT TRIGGERS A PROCESS TO

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:41.142
ACTUALLY ENTER YOU INTO THE

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:43.711
SYSTEM THEN GET PRE REGISTERED --

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:46.548
BY THE STATE -- HOWEVER WHEN YOU

01:24:46.614 --> 01:24:48.116
RETURN WHEN YOU'RE SIXTEEN OR

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:49.150

MAY HAVE ALREADY FILLED OUT THAT

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:53.955
FORM ANSWER TO MISS THE MOMENT.

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.423
SO WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.592
PROVIDE A TECHNICAL FIX WE THINK

01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:00.295
AROUND THIS THIS PARTICULAR FORM

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.497

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.780
THAT -- THEY DO PAY TAXES

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.081
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT TURNS OUT

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:23.184

UNDERTAKEN IN THE LEGISLATURE --

01:28:00.742 --> 01:28:02.744
STARTING A WAYS BACK WITH A BILL

INITIATIVE PROCESS STILL AT THE

CORE OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS STATE

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.564
AND IT'S STILL HELD DEAR BY MANY

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.767
VOTERS BUT WE NEED TO PROVIDE

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:27.235

A BILL WE MOVE LAST YEAR --

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.817
