OWED I JUST KNOW THAT THE PAST

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.057 region:rollup2
OUR OFFICE HAS RAISED CONCERNS

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:05.624 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY USED BY

EMPLOY THEIR APPROACH AYE THIS

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:10.896 region:rollup2
YEAR'S CUT CALCULATION IS

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.631 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THAT

00:27:10.896 --> 00:27:13.365 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:17.069 region:rollup2

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:23.775 region:rollup2
I THE MEASURE DOESN'T SPECIFY

HOW THE DEPOSIT MUST BE

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:26.645 region:rollup2
CALCULATED SO THERE'S NO CORRECT

00:27:25.677 --> 00:27:27.980 region:rollup2
WAY TO MEET ITS FISCAL

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.847 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.082 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN OUR VIEW THE

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:31.617 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION LIKELY

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:33.852 region:rollup2
UNDERESTIMATES THE SAVINGS FOR

00:27:31.617 --> 00:27:35.854 region:rollup2
VARIOUS REASONS.

COMPONENT COMPONENT OF THE

00:27:37.189 --> 00:27:39.858 region:rollup2
SAVINGS ARE THOSE ASSOCIATED

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:40.959 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:43.028 region:rollup2
I'M HAVING A LOWER PRISON

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:45.464 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE IF

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:46.732 region:rollup2
PROP FORTY SEVEN HADN'T PASSED.

00:27:45.464 --> 00:27:48.100 region:rollup2
I'M USING OUR APPROACH WE

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:49.968 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THAT THE PRISON

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.704 region:rollup2
POPULATION SAVINGS AND SEVENTEEN

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:53.672 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TO BE DEPOSITED IN.

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:55.440 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE'RE

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:57.309 region:rollup2
LIKELY TENS OF MILLIONS HIGHER

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.077 region:rollup2
THAN OR ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE

00:27:57.309 --> 00:28:03.849 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF OF

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:04.616 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION.

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:08.020 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD WE ARE?

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:10.289 region:rollup2
?

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.192 region:rollup2
WELL I'LL I'LL SEE IF ANYONE IS

00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:14.259 region:rollup2
SENDING QUESTIONS THIS IS TONY

00:28:13.192 --> 00:28:14.760 region:rollup2
JUDD EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.429 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE DISCERN WHO'S

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.664 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY IS CORRECT?

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:19.765 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:20.966 region:rollup2
TELLING US ABOUT THE MONEY

00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:22.200 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I YOU HEAR FROM A LOT

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:24.203 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THAT.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.572 region:rollup2
IT'S AN UNDER ESTIMATE THE

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.738 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MORE DATA OUT OF THAT.

00:28:26.572 --> 00:28:27.606 region:rollup2
AND.

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.541 region:rollup2
.

00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:30.342 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE DISCERN THAT IT WOULD

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.510 region:rollup2
WE DISCERN AT THE END OF THE

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:32.411 region:rollup2
YEAR WHEN AS EXTRA MONEY IN THE

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.146 region:rollup2
BANK I MEAN?

00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:35.514 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD WE DISARM WHOSE

00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:36.915 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE CORRECT?

00:28:35.514 --> 00:28:38.550 region:rollup2
BUT MADELINE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:39.651 region:rollup2
FINANCE THE INITIATIVE ACTUALLY

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.652 region:rollup2
GIVES THE AUTHORITY TO THE

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:42.387 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:44.156 region:rollup2
THE CALCULATION. AND ONCE THE

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:46.291 region:rollup2
CALCULATION IS SET THAT AMOUNT

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:47.659 region:rollup2
IS NOT ADJUSTED SO AGAIN

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:49.094 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY.

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.762 region:rollup2
SINCE PROP PROPOSITION FORTY

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:52.764 region:rollup2
SEVEN WAS IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:54.900 region:rollup2
COMPLETED THAT CALCULATION WITH

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:55.867 region:rollup2
SAME METHODOLOGY EACH YEAR.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.803 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY ANY EXTRA MONEY

00:28:55.867 --> 00:29:00.005 region:rollup2
LEFT OVER.

00:28:57.803 --> 00:29:01.907 region:rollup2
OR IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE.

00:29:00.005 --> 00:29:03.342 region:rollup2
YOU SAY IT IS IT MUST BE.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:04.943 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CALCULATION AGAIN IS

00:29:03.342 --> 00:29:05.477 region:rollup2
SET BY A CERTAIN PARAMETERS

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.778 region:rollup2
WHICH I CAN?

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:09.481 region:rollup2
WHEN HAPPY TO PROVIDE DETAILS

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.782 region:rollup2
TO STAFF ON EXACTLY HOW WE DO

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.985 region:rollup2
THE CALCULATION I BELIEVE THE

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.652 region:rollup2
MAIN POINT OF CONCERN BETWEEN US

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:15.220 region:rollup2
AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:17.055 region:rollup2
IS. A RATE.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.157 region:rollup2
THAT AMOUNT TO SEE OF SAVINGS

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:20.459 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTABLE AT THE CONTRACT BED

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:23.662 region:rollup2
RATE VERSES THE MARGINAL RATE.

00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:24.630 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE HAVE A MORE DETAILED A

00:29:23.662 --> 00:29:26.932 region:rollup2
BREAKDOWN WHERE WE HAVE TO

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.033 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTE SAVINGS TO ALL OF THE

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.301 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POPULATION REDUCTION

WITH AN ALREADY STRAINED BUDGET

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:36.013 region:rollup2
THE COST OF OBTAINING A JUDICIAL

00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:37.582 region:rollup2

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:02.520 region:rollup2
PERCEPTION IS THAT THE

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:04.021 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS SECRETIVE AND. YOU

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.090 region:rollup2
KNOW EVERYTHING IS DONE IN

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:07.591 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT THE

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.693 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY SEEKS TO PROTECT

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:10.361 region:rollup2
THE BENCH OFFICERS WHO ARE BEING

00:47:08.693 --> 00:47:11.295 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATED. BUT ACTUALLY THE

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:13.497 region:rollup2
CURRENT SYSTEM OF

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:14.699 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY IS A BALANCE IT

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:16.434 region:rollup2
PROTECTS THE COMPLAINANTS

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:17.802 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AS WELL AS THOSE

00:47:16.434 --> 00:47:18.936 region:rollup2
ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT.

00:47:17.802 --> 00:47:21.338 region:rollup2
AND THE.

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:23.341 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THIS

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:25.009 region:rollup2
BALANCE SHOWS THAT THIS WAS

00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:27.278 region:rollup2
DEEPLY CONSIDERED AND THOUGHT

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:30.214 region:rollup2
ABOUT BY THE LEGISLATURE BYTHE

00:47:27.278 --> 00:47:31.882 region:rollup2
COURT BY EMPLOYERS THE BAR. AND

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:33.584 region:rollup2
BY THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY PASSED

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:35.052 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE NINETY IN

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:36.053 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE SO IT'S NOT

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:37.455 region:rollup2
REALLY JUST THE COMMISSION

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:39.056 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH SOMETHING OUT OF

00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:40.424 region:rollup2
THIN AIR THIS WAS. YOU KNOW THE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:42.059 region:rollup2
CONCEPT CONFIDENTIALITY IS TRULY

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.793 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:44.462 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.496 region:rollup2
IT'S EVEN SUCH A CONCEPT

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:47.465 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED STATES

00:47:45.496 --> 00:47:50.201 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT THERE'S ACTUALLY

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:51.335 region:rollup2
ONE STATE IN THE IN THE COUNTRY

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:53.337 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T GIVE

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:55.106 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY TO COMPLAINANTS

00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:56.474 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE STATE OF ALABAMA.

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:58.676 region:rollup2
WOULD HAPPEN IS FORMER CHIEF

00:47:56.474 --> 00:48:01.045 region:rollup2
JUSTICE ROY MOORE INSTITUTED A

00:47:58.676 --> 00:48:02.246 region:rollup2
RULE THAT WAS PUNITIVE TO TRY TO

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:03.280 region:rollup2
FIND OUT ABOUT WHO COMPLAIN

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:05.249 region:rollup2
ABOUT HIM AND HE MADE IT

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.417 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVE ANY DID NOT SEND IT

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:08.419 region:rollup2
OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:10.788 region:rollup2
SO IN IN THAT STATE THERE IS NO

00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:12.356 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY THE ABA STUDY

00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:13.891 region:rollup2
THAT SIT AND FOUND THAT THE

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.192 region:rollup2
WHOLE SYSTEM IS NOW A MASS.

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:16.927 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED IS LAW

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:18.596 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT REFUSES TO WORK THAT

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:20.898 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IN THAT STATE NOW

00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:22.733 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROTECT THE

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:24.001 region:rollup2
IDENTITY OF VICTIMS? OF JUDICIAL

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:25.770 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT.

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:26.337 region:rollup2

LAWYERS WHO PRACTICE THERE THAT

00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:37.848 region:rollup2
EVER IF EVER A LAWYER COMPLAIN

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:40.317 region:rollup2
ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR JUDGE

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:41.685 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALL PUBLIC.

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2
THAT LAWYER AND THAT LAWYERS LAW

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:44.955 region:rollup2

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:47.057 region:rollup2
IN THAT LAWYERS ALL THEIR

CLIENTS EVEN ONE UP BEFORE THE

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:50.227 region:rollup2

COMPLAINT SO TO SUCH A CHILLING

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.630 region:rollup2

AND COURT STAFF NO LONGER FILE

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS ABOUT JUDGES BECAUSE

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.906 region:rollup2
THERE'S TOO MUCH FEAR OF

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.574 region:rollup2
RETRIBUTION. AND THAT WHAT WE

00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:06.110 region:rollup2
FOUND IN TWENTY YEARS OF LOOKING

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:07.645 region:rollup2
AT COMMISSION DATA IS THAT

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VERY HIGH CORRELATION

00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:10.047 region:rollup2
BETWEEN COMPLAINTS MADE BY

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:12.616 region:rollup2
JUDGES AND COURT STAFF AND

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:14.318 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AN ACTUAL DISCIPLINE

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:16.287 region:rollup2
GIVEN TO BENCH OFFICERS AND

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:17.922 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE.

00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:20.457 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE CA

00:49:17.922 --> 00:49:22.526 region:rollup2
CANNONS REQUIRE OF US JUDGES IN

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:23.828 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BEING ETHICAL. AND

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:26.363 region:rollup2
THERE THEY HERE VARIED THERE

00:49:23.828 --> 00:49:28.098 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY SO THEY SEE IT AND SO

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:29.200 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT I THINK TO

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:30.968 region:rollup2
PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE'S

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.503 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY. PARTICULARLY

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.371 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE

STILL WORKING COURT HOUSES WHERE

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:37.641 region:rollup2

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:03.033 region:rollup2

AUTHORITY THAT THEY HOLD SO OF

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:49.713 region:rollup2
COURT WORKERS WHO ARE SUBJECTED

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:53.918 region:rollup2
AFRAID TO REPORT IT TO THE COURT

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:56.020 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION OR IN SOME CASES

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:57.788 region:rollup2
EVEN HAVE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.224 region:rollup2
THE COURT ADMINISTRATION. AND

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:03.260 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:05.129 region:rollup2
THE C. JP'S COMPLAINT PROCESS

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.765 region:rollup2
AND INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAS MADE

00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:10.301 region:rollup2
THESE WORKERS FEEL CONFIDENT AND

00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:11.802 region:rollup2
SAFE REALLY TO STEP FORWARD AND

00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:12.870 region:rollup2
SPEAK OUT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.705 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WITNESS EITHER

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:17.007 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OR. WITH OTHER

00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:17.775 region:rollup2

WITH THE PUBLIC

00:51:17.775 --> 00:51:20.210 region:rollup2
SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:22.413 region:rollup2
THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT OF THE

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:25.516 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY IS A VERY REAL.

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:27.084 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THIS CGP

00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:29.486 region:rollup2

YOU'RE VERY VERY BRIGHT ARE

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.991 region:rollup2
WHICH IS MY MY NAME IS JANICE

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:35.259 region:rollup2
PRICKLY AND THE LEGAL ADVISER TO

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:36.560 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSIONERS I THINK THE

00:51:35.259 --> 00:51:37.761 region:rollup2
LEGAL POINTS HAVE BEEN COVERED

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.430 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE TWO

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:41.932 region:rollup2
BRIEF COMMENTS. FROM THE

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:43.634 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF STAFFS ARM OF THE

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:46.036 region:rollup2
COMMISSION ONE IS THAT. BEFORE I

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:47.604 region:rollup2
WAS HIRED AS THE LEGAL ADVISER I

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:49.206 region:rollup2
WORK IS INVESTIGATING ATTORNEY.

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:51.709 region:rollup2
AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:53.844 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN I WOULD CALL WITNESSES

00:51:51.709 --> 00:51:55.279 region:rollup2
OR EVEN COMPLAINANTS TO GET

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:57.114 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASE THEY

00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:59.583 region:rollup2
WERE VERY OFTEN RELUCTANT TO

00:51:57.114 --> 00:52:00.551 region:rollup2
TALK UNTIL THEY WERE ASSURED.

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:02.319 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR STATEMENTS WOULD

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:03.854 region:rollup2
REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL AND LESS THE

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:06.090 region:rollup2
CASE WENT TO FORMAL PROCEEDING

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:07.524 region:rollup2
WHICH IS VERY VERY SMALL

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:08.025 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THE CASES.

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.526 region:rollup2
HE'S OFTEN ATTORNEYS WHO

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:10.594 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO APPEAR BEFORE THESE

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:12.496 region:rollup2
JUDGES.

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:13.030 region:rollup2
COURT STAFF AS WAS MENTIONED AND

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.232 region:rollup2
LED AGAINST WHAT I'M GOING

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:16.333 region:rollup2
CASES.

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.668 region:rollup2
THE OTHER BRIEF POINT I WANT TO

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:20.037 region:rollup2
MAKE IS THAT.

00:52:17.668 --> 00:52:21.505 region:rollup2
STAFF IN OUR OFFICE WORKS VERY

00:52:20.037 --> 00:52:22.940 region:rollup2
VERY HARD THEY HAVE HEAVY

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:24.508 region:rollup2
CASELOADS.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:26.243 region:rollup2
A HOT DAY ARE COMMITTED TO THE

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:27.344 region:rollup2
MISSION OF THE COMMISSION WHICH

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:28.812 region:rollup2
IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:30.180 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:31.048 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN THE INTEGRITY OF

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.384 region:rollup2
JUDICIARY.

00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:35.052 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:33.384 --> 00:52:37.354 region:rollup2
ANY CUT IN OUR BUDGET WOULD

00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:40.190 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MEAN MUCH HEAVIER

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:42.226 region:rollup2
CASELOADS BACKLOG DELAY WHICH OF

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.660 region:rollup2
COURSE MEANS IT WOULD HINDER THE

00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:44.795 region:rollup2
COMMISSION'S ABILITY. TO PROTECT

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.698 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC

00:52:44.795 --> 00:52:49.867 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:52:47.698 --> 00:52:50.601 region:rollup2
NO I DIDN'T HAVE REQUEST.

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:52.903 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THE STONE.

00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:56.340 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:58.375 region:rollup2
HERE'S THE DILEMMA.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:00.477 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION REALLY IS AND.

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:01.578 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT.

00:53:00.477 --> 00:53:03.614 region:rollup2
WE AGREE THAT THE RECORDS ARE TO

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:04.948 region:rollup2
BE HELD CONFIDENCE.

00:53:03.614 --> 00:53:06.917 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS WHETHER.

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:07.885 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR.

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.020 region:rollup2
PERFORMING A FUNCTION ASKED BY

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:10.521 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.755 region:rollup2
WILL HOLD THOSE RECORDS

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:12.656 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:14.191 region:rollup2
AND THE OUTER SAYING YES THEY

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:15.526 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.261 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SO THAT'S NOT

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:19.063 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

00:53:17.261 --> 00:53:20.798 region:rollup2
SHOULD VIOLATE.

00:53:19.063 --> 00:53:22.566 region:rollup2
YOUR OBLIGATIONS OF OF

00:53:20.798 --> 00:53:24.201 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY AND THAT'S THE

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:25.903 region:rollup2
PIECE THAT REALLY ULTIMATELY

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:27.337 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GET WORKED OUT HERE.

00:53:25.903 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN THE

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:31.108 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND FORTUNATELY IT MAY

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:33.310 region:rollup2
TAKE US AWHILE TO GET TO SOME

00:53:31.108 --> 00:53:34.411 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION AND IN THE MEANTIME.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.280 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:37.581 region:rollup2
AND WE.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.049 region:rollup2
WE TAKE AR OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:40.718 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SERIOUSLY

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:42.019 region:rollup2
AND WE DO THAT A COUPLE OF WAYS

00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:44.955 region:rollup2
IS ASKING THE AUDITOR TO GO IN

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.125 region:rollup2
AND AUDIT. NOT JUST THE

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:49.426 region:rollup2
FINANCIALS BUT THE FUNCTION OF

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:51.328 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THIS HAPPENS TIME

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:52.863 region:rollup2
AND TIME AGAIN THEY ACTUALLY CAN

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:55.899 region:rollup2
HOLD THINGS CONFIDENTIAL WEARS

00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:58.368 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE DOING IT IT'S NOT HELD.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:59.803 region:rollup2
SO WE DO OVERSIGHT HEARINGS.

00:53:58.368 --> 00:54:01.705 region:rollup2
MY COMMITTEE OR HERE THROUGH THE

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:02.940 region:rollup2
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:04.108 region:rollup2
WE CAN ASK PEOPLE TO COME IN AND

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.044 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS.

00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:09.613 region:rollup2
SO.

00:54:07.044 --> 00:54:10.180 region:rollup2
FOR US TO WEIGH IN ON A BUDGET

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.381 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup2
UNDER.

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:14.384 region:rollup2
IS.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:16.453 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD ORGANIZATIONS

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:18.422 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING?

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:19.957 region:rollup2
WHAT THE INTERNAL RULES ARE?

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:21.592 region:rollup2
HOW DO RESPONSIVE THEY ARE OR

00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:22.359 region:rollup2
AREN'T IN SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.428 region:rollup2
THAT ARE RAISED BY THE PUBLIC?

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:25.662 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:27.131 region:rollup2
NOT WANTING TO BREAK THE

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:28.232 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY AGAIN THAT'S NOT

00:54:27.131 --> 00:54:29.900 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT

00:54:28.232 --> 00:54:31.702 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:33.036 region:rollup2
YOU DESCRIBED ALABAMA WHERE

00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:34.738 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TRUST ACCOUNTANTS IN

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:37.407 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM WE KEEP HEARING I

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:39.810 region:rollup2
KEEP HEARING. CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:40.778 region:rollup2
SEE JP IS IS FUNCTIONING AND AND

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.746 region:rollup2
I FEEL THAT THAT'S OUR

00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:44.248 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO TO FERRET OUT

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:46.450 region:rollup2
AND FIGURE OU WHAT'S REAL

00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:48.919 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NOT REAL. AND HOW WE DO

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:50.287 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD AND YES WE ARE.

00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:51.889 region:rollup2
SEPARATE YOUR GOVERNMENT

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:53.423 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WE WOULD HAVE TO PASS

00:54:51.889 --> 00:54:55.292 region:rollup2
LAWS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN OR

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:56.760 region:rollup2
SEEK CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO

00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:58.529 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT THAT WE CAN'T IF

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.497 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT THERE WAS. AN ISSUE

00:54:58.529 --> 00:55:01.431 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED IT TO RESOLVE BUT

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:03.100 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO IS

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:04.401 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE ISSUES ARE.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:07.037 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE ASK THE

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:09.473 region:rollup2
AUDITOR TO GO DO THAT FUNCTION.

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:10.741 region:rollup2
AND I WORRY THAT THE LAWSUIT.

00:55:09.473 --> 00:55:11.942 region:rollup2
AND EVERY SIDES AND TELL ME WHAT

00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.111 region:rollup2
WE'RE RIGHT WE'RE RIGHT.

00:55:11.942 --> 00:55:16.013 region:rollup2
TEN CHILE.

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:18.215 region:rollup2
AND FLICKS OR INFRINGES ON OUR

00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:19.082 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO OUR OVERSIGHT

00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:20.684 region:rollup2
FUNCTION AND AND GO GET

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.186 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIGURE

00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:25.556 region:rollup2
OUT HOW WE CAN GET THE

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:27.558 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WE NEED THROUGH

00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:29.293 region:rollup2
THE OUTER.

00:55:27.558 --> 00:55:31.895 region:rollup2
HOLD IT CONFIDENTIAL SO THAT

00:55:29.293 --> 00:55:33.163 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SATISFIED THAT THAT THE

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:33.997 region:rollup2
THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.465 region:rollup2
GETTING INFORMATION OUT THE

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:37.234 region:rollup2
PUBLIC MARKET HAPPEN.

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:38.602 region:rollup2
LET US POTENTIALLY FROM EITHER

00:55:37.234 --> 00:55:41.405 region:rollup2
POLICIES EMPLOYED AND OR BUDGET

00:55:38.602 --> 00:55:42.906 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT. REVIEW AND LOOK AT.

00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:45.442 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM THAT

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:46.643 region:rollup2
TGP USES TO HOLD JUDGES

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:48.312 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S VERY VERY

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:49.813 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF EVERYTHING

00:55:48.312 --> 00:55:51.081 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO.

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:52.416 region:rollup2
AND IN THE MEANTIME BE ABLE TO

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:54.351 region:rollup2
MAKE.

00:55:52.416 --> 00:55:56.820 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE BUDGET.

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:58.455 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.524 region:rollup2
THAT GET YOU THE MONEY THE

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:02.359 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO GO DO THE FUNCTION

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:04.628 region:rollup2
THAT THAT YOU NEED TO BEFORE.

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2
THAT SORT OF WHERE WE ARE AND IF

00:56:04.628 --> 00:56:06.630 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT NOW A

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:08.699 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS I THINK THAT'S CAN

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.934 region:rollup2
BE VERY FRUSTRATING.

00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:12.202 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYBODY IF THIS ENDS UP

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:14.404 region:rollup2
WITH OUR WITH.

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.872 region:rollup2
PUTTING SOME LIMITS.

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:17.908 region:rollup2
ON OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:18.942 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT FUNCTION.

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:20.577 region:rollup2
THE COURTS DECIDE THAT THE

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:21.712 region:rollup2
COURTS DECIDE THAT BUT IT WILL

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:23.947 region:rollup2
NOT GO VERY WELL WITH OUR

00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:24.381 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS.

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.550 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ASKING US TO

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:28.252 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE?

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.553 region:rollup2
WE'RE COMING OUT OF A HORT TERM

00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:31.622 region:rollup2
LIMITED ERA AND I THINK THE

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:32.990 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY ESPECIALLY HAD NOT

00:56:31.622 --> 00:56:34.858 region:rollup2
REALLY DONE ITS JOB FOR A LONG

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:37.594 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:38.495 region:rollup2
WITH THAT OVERSIGHT OBLIGATION.

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:40.230 region:rollup2
THOSE OF US HERE NOW HAVE A

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:41.231 region:rollup2
LITTLE LONGER HORIZON AND ARE

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.432 region:rollup2
TRYING TO TAKE SOME OF THAT

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:44.601 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY SO WE'RE LEARNING.

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:47.437 region:rollup2
WHICH AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:48.438 region:rollup2
OUR JOBS NOT JUST PASSED BILLS

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.907 region:rollup2
WHICH OF WE IF NOTHING ELSE TO

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:51.775 region:rollup2
DO WE'RE GONNA PASSED BILLS AND

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:53.243 region:rollup2
WE DO THAT AD NAUSEUM AND WE

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:55.112 region:rollup2
PASS BILLS THAT DON'T.

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.313 region:rollup2
ALWAYS MAKE MUCH SENSE BUT.

00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:57.781 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO WHEN

00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:59.683 region:rollup2
WE DON'T OR OVERSIGHT THAN THEY

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:01.251 region:rollup2
WERE SORT OF LEAVING BEHIND PART

00:56:59.683 --> 00:57:02.619 region:rollup2
OF PART OF OUR OBLIGATION.

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.654 region:rollup2
SO I'M REALLY HOPING THAT

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.789 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:06.957 region:rollup2
A PATH HERE.

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:08.558 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN GET SOME OF THOSE

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:09.993 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ALL.

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:11.662 region:rollup2
BUT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO IN

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:13.330 region:rollup2
THIS IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO

00:57:11.662 --> 00:57:14.631 region:rollup2
FOR US TO BUILD TO A BUDGET WE

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.366 region:rollup2
DO NEED.

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.734 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:19.770 region:rollup2
OF THE CHALLENGES.

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:21.872 region:rollup2
THAT YOU FACE.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.273 region:rollup2
BUDGET RESOURCE CHALLENGES BUT

00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:25.042 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS HOW THINGS WORK HOW

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:26.977 region:rollup2
THINGS AREN'T WORKING.

00:57:25.042 --> 00:57:28.512 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS OF

00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:29.112 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE THINK THAT'S GOOD BAD

00:57:28.512 --> 00:57:30.714 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AYE I DON'T REALLY

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:33.183 region:rollup2
KNOW IT THIS.

00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:34.418 region:rollup2
AND.

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:36.253 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT OPEN UP SOMETHING

00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:38.055 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO OPEN UP.

00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:39.356 region:rollup2
BUT I ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE FEW

00:57:38.055 --> 00:57:39.923 region:rollup2
WE WE SHOULD.

00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:41.291 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:42.693 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.293 region:rollup2
AND THE THE AUDITOR'S PERFORMING

00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:45.028 region:rollup2
THEIR FUNCTION BECAUSE WE ASK

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:47.230 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:49.232 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SORT OF A NORMAL WAY

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:50.934 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DO IT AND.

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:52.469 region:rollup2
BEFORE GONNA FIGHT OVER SEPARATE

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:54.271 region:rollup2
BRANCHES OF FOR UNIFIED OVER

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:57.374 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL

00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:59.443 region:rollup2
WELL AND GOOD. BY THAT LEAVES US

00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:59.977 region:rollup2
WITH OUT MUCH TO WORK WITH AS WE

00:57:59.443 --> 00:58:02.813 region:rollup2
TRY TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN

00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:05.015 region:rollup2
WHERE.

00:58:02.813 --> 00:58:06.049 region:rollup2
DECIDING. HOW TO HOW TO FUND

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:08.885 region:rollup2
THINGS HOW DO YOU OUR

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:10.554 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:11.655 region:rollup2

FOR THIS THING NOW TO BE

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:47.124 region:rollup2
RESOLVED IN COURT I AM I HAD

00:58:45.856 --> 00:58:48.492 region:rollup2
HEARD BEEN DISAPPOINTED SUPREME

00:58:47.124 --> 00:58:49.559 region:rollup2
COURT DID TAKE THIS UP AS I

00:58:48.492 --> 00:58:51.628 region:rollup2
THOUGHT. THAT WOULD BE A FASTER

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:53.830 region:rollup2

BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.870 region:rollup2

00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:10.714 region:rollup2
HAVE. BUILT GOOD RELATIONSHIPS

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:12.082 region:rollup2
AND I AM BOUND AND DETERMINED TO

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:14.051 region:rollup2
BUILD AND MAINTAIN A GOOD

00:59:12.082 --> 00:59:15.652 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JUDICIAL

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:18.755 region:rollup2
SEPARATE CO EQUAL BRANCH OF

00:59:16.453 --> 00:59:19.956 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.391 region:rollup2
AS ARE WEAK AND AND WE HAVE OUR

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:23.760 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS OF.

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:25.362 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION YES BUT OVERSIGHT.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.129 region:rollup2
GETTING QUESTIONS RAISED GETTING

00:59:25.362 --> 00:59:27.631 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ANSWERED AND FIGURING

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:28.799 region:rollup2
IT OUT

00:59:27.631 --> 00:59:30.167 region:rollup2
AND WE EITHER DO THAT OPEN

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:31.068 region:rollup2
HEARINGS LIKE THIS.

00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:32.135 region:rollup2
WE DO IT THROUGH THE AUDITOR

00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:34.004 region:rollup2
WHICH

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:35.906 region:rollup2
CAN'T HOLD INFORMATION

00:59:34.004 --> 00:59:38.141 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENTIAL.

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:40.310 region:rollup2
OR WERE SORT OF LEFT NOT KNOWING

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:42.145 region:rollup2
QUITE WHAT TO DO.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.580 region:rollup2
SO MY PLEA IS

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:45.949 region:rollup2
LET'S FIND A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:47.551 region:rollup2
LET'S BY THE WAY TO GET MOVING

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:49.086 region:rollup2
FOR LET'S GET THE INFORMATION.

00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:49.653 region:rollup2
INTO THE LEGISLATIVE CONTACTS

00:59:49.086 --> 00:59:51.888 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE INFORMATION IS

00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:52.889 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:54.024 region:rollup2
AND IF WE DISAGREE WITH THAT

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:55.892 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER SUBJECT WE

00:59:54.024 --> 00:59:57.294 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE CONVERSATION AROUND.

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.795 region:rollup2
BUT HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION

00:59:57.294 --> 01:00:00.797 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:03.400 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF OF THE C. JP AND

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:05.168 region:rollup2

WHICH I'D BE HAPPY TO DO.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:08.672 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT I UNDERSTAND IT OR

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:10.507 region:rollup2
SEEK POLICY CHANGES.

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:12.542 region:rollup2
THAT ADDRESS

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:14.311 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS THAT THAT

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:15.979 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BE MAYBE REYES. BUT

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.280 region:rollup2
AS A POLICYMAKER EVEN SITTING ON

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.914 region:rollup2

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:20.951 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:22.953 region:rollup2
AND I'M FRUSTRATED HAVING

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.955 region:rollup2

HAVE THE CHANCE TO GET THERE BUT

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:31.061 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL GET THERE EVENTUALLY

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:32.195 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S GET THERE. FIND A WAY

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:35.365 region:rollup2
TO GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:37.300 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:40.904 region:rollup2
TONY COMES MISTER LACKEY.

OF C. JP AND AND WE'VE HAD

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES SIMILAR ISSUES OF

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.850 region:rollup2
FOLKS NINE ONE TO SHARE

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.085 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND OWN WE DID A LOT

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.486 region:rollup2
GANG LIST WE ALMOST HAVE TO GO

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:58.421 region:rollup2
TO COURT ON THAT.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:03.426 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT BUT THE.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:04.861 region:rollup2
THE AUDITORS ARE ARE I REALLY.

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:06.463 region:rollup2
IS IT DOG REALLY AN ARM OF US IN

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:08.398 region:rollup2
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET THE

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:11.701 region:rollup2
THAT THEY AND NONE OF US DOUBT

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:13.803 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF EUROPE OF

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:15.438 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY. WITH REGARDS TO

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.006 region:rollup2
WHY YOU WANT TO KEEP CERTAIN

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:18.542 region:rollup2
THINGS CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:19.976 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. BUT THE AUDITORS ARE

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:22.178 region:rollup2
ALSO INDIVIDUAL SWORN TO SOME

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:24.281 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF SICK OF PRIVACY AND

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:27.217 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY AND HANDLING THE

MATERIAL THAT'S THERE. ARE IN

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.319 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR US TO GET.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:31.655 region:rollup2
THE PERSPECTIVE WE NEED ON HOW

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:33.456 region:rollup2
THINGS OPERATE I THINK THE THIS

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.991 region:rollup2
ALL UP COMMISSIONS EXIST AND

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:36.760 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SINCE WHAT SIXTY ONE OF

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:37.894 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. AND YOU NOT HAVE AN

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.363 region:rollup2
AUDIT DONE AT ALL.

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:41.831 region:rollup2
AND TO HAVE INTERNAL AUDITS OF

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.933 region:rollup2
THE WORDS YOU ARE ADDING

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.534 region:rollup2
YOURSELF WE FOUND THAT DOES

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:46.169 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK WELL I MEAN YOU

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:48.138 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE. SOME OUTSIDE

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:49.973 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE WITH REGARD TO THE

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:51.508 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS THERE NOW I KNOW

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:53.310 region:rollup2
THAT THE ALL MEMBERS OF THE C.

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:54.844 region:rollup2
JP CAN ALWAYS VOTE TO AMEND THE

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:57.013 region:rollup2
RULES IN ORDER TO ALLOW.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:58.281 region:rollup2
THIS STATE AUDITOR'S TO

01:01:57.013 --> 01:02:00.083 region:rollup2
BASICALLY LOOK AT THAT THE

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:02.352 region:rollup2
MATERIAL RULE ONE OUT TO MY

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:04.454 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING I WAS TOLD.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.055 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU IF THE

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.057 region:rollup2
AS IT IS AN ORGANIZATION ONE

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.992 region:rollup2
EVEN DISCUSS THAT AS WITH THE

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:11.494 region:rollup2
NOT THAT WOULD BE. A AN OPTION

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.429 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO ALL TOO MANY RULES

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:14.231 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE JUDICIAL

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:16.766 region:rollup2
COUNCILS AMENDING THE RULES AS

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:18.401 region:rollup2
WELL TEN. A TEN POINT FIVE TO

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:19.836 region:rollup2
DISCLOSE PAYMENTS MADE BY. THE

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:21.671 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO SETTLE

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:26.309 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES SO THERE

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:26.610 region:rollup2
ARE AMENDMENTS THAT DO EXIST IN

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.043 region:rollup2
AND AND AND.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
.

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.379 region:rollup2
IN THIS SO IT ARENA AND I WOULD

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:31.247 region:rollup2
IMAGINE HAVING NEVER BEEN ASKED

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:33.717 region:rollup2
TO DO AN AUDIT IN WHAT'S IN

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE. WHICH IS A VERY LONG

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.853 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:38.121 region:rollup2
WHAT ALMOST FIFTY YEARS BECAUSE

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE FIFTY

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.957 region:rollup2
YEARS OF FIFTY YEARS NEVER

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.059 region:rollup2
HAVING AN AUDIT PROBLEM NOBODY

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:45.228 region:rollup2
ASKED TO? WEAR THE RULES.

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:46.663 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY ENTITY

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:48.732 region:rollup2
THAT ASK THAT NEEDS TO HAVE

01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:50.500 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO DATA THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:51.401 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THAT YOU

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.670 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:54.904 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR OUR ISSUES

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.606 region:rollup2
MEGA SAID IN AND AND THE

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:58.308 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS AMENDING ITS

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:59.809 region:rollup2
RULESBECAUSE THIS OTHER PIECE

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:00.744 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF PAYMENTS. THAT WENT

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:02.212 region:rollup2
OUT ON ISSUES OF SEXUAL

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:03.647 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THAT TRADITIONALLY

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.448 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:06.016 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SO. EVEN THOUGH YOU

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.984 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.918 region:rollup2
A RULE CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH I

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:10.987 region:rollup2
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AND WOULD

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:13.223 region:rollup2
NOT WANT YOU NOT TO HAVE IT.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:16.059 region:rollup2
HAVING NEVER BEEN ASKED TO DO

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:16.693 region:rollup2
AN AUDIT YOU PROBABLY NEVER HAVE

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:16.860 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY EVEN THINK ABOUT

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:17.060 region:rollup2
IT.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.161 region:rollup2
AND.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.163 region:rollup2
AFTER FIFTY SOME ODD YEARS OF

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:22.165 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:23.700 region:rollup2
SOMEONE IN A LEGITIMATE POSITION

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:25.535 region:rollup2
LIKE THE LEGISLATURE THAT

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.003 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IS OVERSIGHT BODY. OF

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:28.772 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDS ALL OF THESE THINGS

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.673 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE WE OFTEN CALL

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:31.841 region:rollup2
FOUGHT IT'S ALMOST EVERYTHING WE

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:34.210 region:rollup2
DO. A NOW BECAUSE OF THE FACT

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:36.913 region:rollup2
pMUCH MORE.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:37.914 region:rollup2
A RESPONSIVE TO THE ISSUES THAT

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:40.116 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MAKE WHEN TRYING TO COME

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:41.851 region:rollup2
WATCH OR SPONSORED TO THE BUDGET

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:43.286 region:rollup2
THAT THEY REQUEST AND MAKE YOU

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.321 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT THAT WE CUT BUDGETS

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:45.789 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IF WE CAN AUGMENT

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.857 region:rollup2
BUDGETS AND GOOD TIMES. IT'S

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:49.459 region:rollup2
IMPORTED DO THAT TO YOU YOU

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:51.227 region:rollup2
MENTION THAT YOU'VE GOT A

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.995 region:rollup2
BACKLOG A YOU'VE BEEN CUT TEN

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:53.496 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:56.499 region:rollup2
HAVE A BACKLOG OF CASES MAY NOW

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:57.767 region:rollup2
BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW OF A

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.301 region:rollup2
IF WHETHER NOT TO AND AND IT

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.469 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE IS

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.770 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:02.639 region:rollup2
NINETY SOME ODD PERCENT I THINK

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:04.307 region:rollup2
IN THE REPORT FATHER EITHER

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:06.343 region:rollup2
CLOSED AFTER INITIAL REVIEW A

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:08.378 region:rollup2
CLOSE WITH THAT THIS POSITION.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:09.446 region:rollup2
AFTER INVESTIGATION SO I'M NOT

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.647 region:rollup2
AND I ASSUME THAT'S A GOOD THING

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:13.316 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:14.984 region:rollup2
OF ME WE OFTEN HAVE. FOLKS WHO.

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:16.152 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THESE HIGH NUMBERS

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:19.022 region:rollup2
IN THOSE NOT GOOD NUMBERS.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:20.957 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.859 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE NINETY SIX PERCENT OF

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:23.727 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINTS BEING FILED.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:27.363 region:rollup2
HAVING NO RESOLUTION TO A MORE

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:27.831 region:rollup2
NEEDS NO ONE NO ACTION TAKEN BY

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.998 region:rollup2
IN THAT SAME SET SO.

01:04:27.831 --> 01:04:29.999 region:rollup2
HAS YOUR ORGANIZATION THOUGHT

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:31.901 region:rollup2
ABOUT WAVING THE RULES I SHOULD

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:34.304 region:rollup2
GUESS I SHOULD ASK ALL SINCE YOU

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:36.039 region:rollup2
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:37.741 region:rollup2
JUST A.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:40.009 region:rollup2
JUST BRIEFLY MADAM CHAIR

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:41.945 region:rollup2
BUT THERE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:44.514 region:rollup2
THE STATUTORY SCHEME ABOUT THE

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:46.383 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS. ONCE

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:49.219 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THE HANDS OF THE

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:51.821 region:rollup2
AUDITOR. AND SECTION EIGHTY FIVE

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:54.357 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE ARM OF THE GOVERNMENT

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:56.493 region:rollup2
CODE STATES THAT.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:59.396 region:rollup2
RECORDS IN THE HANDS OF THE

01:04:56.493 --> 01:05:01.097 region:rollup2
AUDITOR ARE PUBLIC RECORDS AND

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:03.366 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE FORTY FIVE C. TALKS

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:05.335 region:rollup2
ABOUT. DOCUMENTS THAT ARE

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:06.770 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE BUT

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:09.806 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:14.077 region:rollup2
RELIED UPON FOR REPORTS THAT THE

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:15.745 region:rollup2
AUDITOR. R. RENDERS ARE SUBJECT

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.679 region:rollup2
ARE SUBJECT TO.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.315 region:rollup2
.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:20.683 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURE THROUGH.

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:22.685 region:rollup2
THROUGH RECORD REQUESTS UNDER

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:25.288 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:27.056 region:rollup2
AND SO EVEN IT AND I WOULD SAY

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:30.193 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS AN AT BEST

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:32.262 region:rollup2
AMBIGUOUS. AND THEN WOULD PUT

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:35.465 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS IN THE

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:37.567 region:rollup2
HANDS OF THE AUDITOR AT RISK OF

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:40.136 region:rollup2
REQUEST AND DISCLOSURE PURSUANT

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:41.404 region:rollup2
TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT SO.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:43.840 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT THE COMMISSION NEEDS

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:45.508 region:rollup2
IS IT NEED CERTAINTY THAT ALL

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.843 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS IN THE

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:49.078 region:rollup2
HANDS OF AUDITOR COULD REMAIN

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:52.382 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL. AND THEN.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:54.751 region:rollup2
AND AND ALONG WITH THAT YES

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:56.820 region:rollup2
THE THERE COULD BE ARE AT IT AN

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:58.455 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO RULE ONE NO TWO BUT

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.823 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD HAVE TO

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.990 region:rollup2
GO TOGETHER.

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:03.560 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR IF I MONEY.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.161 region:rollup2
IT'S ARMS.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.929 region:rollup2
DOES IT THAT'S IT TO TO GET THAT

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:06.729 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.864 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GET TOO MUCH IN IN THE

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.932 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH BUT THIS IS A

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:10.834 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND I THINK

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:12.168 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR CAN HELP. EXPLAIN

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:13.503 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T NOT SURE THAT.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:15.538 region:rollup2
THE RULES NEED TO BE CHANGED I

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:17.273 region:rollup2
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMON

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.942 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. DIRECT

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:20.310 region:rollup2
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:20.777 region:rollup2
REQUIRES WHAT SOME THE

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.146 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS ARE BECAUSE

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:24.481 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.882 region:rollup2
THE OTTER COULD NOT PERFORM

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.617 region:rollup2
THEIR FUNCTION THAT WE ASK THEM

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:28.184 region:rollup2
TO ON A REGULAR BASIS IS WE'RE

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.253 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:31.154 region:rollup2
IN

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:32.856 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTING THE AUDITOR TO GO

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:35.024 region:rollup2
GET RECORDS WHETHER IT'S FROM

01:06:32.856 --> 01:06:36.893 region:rollup2
TGP OR ANYBODY ELSE IN ORDER TO

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:38.328 region:rollup2
VIOLATE CONFIDENTIALITY OR MAKE

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:39.629 region:rollup2
RECORDS.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:41.197 region:rollup2
PUBLIC THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:42.699 region:rollup2
BE PUBLIC THAT'S THAT'S NOT IN

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:44.501 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.435 region:rollup2
OR ANYONE HERE AND SO YEAH FOR

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.669 region:rollup2
ME I THINK THESE MECHANISMS

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.770 region:rollup2
EXIST OUT LIKE TO GET THE

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.806 region:rollup2
AUDITOR TO RESPOND.

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:03.152 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:04.320 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVILEGE.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.855 region:rollup2
AB FIVE FORTY FIVE POINT TWO

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.992 region:rollup2
MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AS

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:11.127 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WE STAND IN THE SHOES

01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:13.496 region:rollup2

FIRST THING THAT WOULD WE WOULD

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:31.014 region:rollup2

TO PARTICIPATE AS THE REAL PARTY

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:49.832 region:rollup2
OF INTEREST IN THE EVENT THAT WE

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:52.735 region:rollup2
WERE SUED.

SINGLE YEAR THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA AT THE LOCAL

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:02.645 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT LETTER LEVEL IN THE

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:04.414 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL BRANCH AT THE STATE

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:06.382 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE DO NOT

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:07.850 region:rollup2
RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. WE

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.552 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT RELEASE YOUR

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:13.756 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:16.059 region:rollup2
WE COULDN'T IT WOULD BE A CRIME.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
NOBODY WANTS COMMIT A CRIME

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:19.896 region:rollup2
AGAINST AND JUDGE THIS VISION.

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:20.697 region:rollup2
SO I.

01:08:19.896 --> 01:08:22.231 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A FORM

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:23.566 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK FOR THAT WITHIN CITY

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:25.301 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO GET THE TWO

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:27.036 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES OUT THERE YEAH

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.972 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS THIS IS.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.640 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR FRUSTRATION IF WE

01:08:28.972 --> 01:08:32.275 region:rollup2
WANT TO COMPLETE OUR WORK OF

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.677 region:rollup2
GETTING AN AUDIT DONE. BEING

01:08:32.275 --> 01:08:35.244 region:rollup2
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.446 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:37.580 region:rollup2
RAISED ABOUT SEE JP WHETHER

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.948 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REAL WHETHER THEY'RE NOT

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.916 region:rollup2
REAL THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.217 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION IS ABOUT AND

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:42.418 region:rollup2
WHETHER. WE NEED TO WEIGH IN OR

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:44.053 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:46.589 region:rollup2
FOR ONE I'M NOT CONVINCED WE

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:49.359 region:rollup2
NEED TO CHANGE THINGS.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:51.260 region:rollup2
I'M HOPING THAT.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.861 region:rollup2
ABSENT THE LAWSUIT I WOULD HOPE

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.029 region:rollup2
THAT THE PARTIES COULD FIGURE

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:55.198 region:rollup2
THIS OUT.

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:57.033 region:rollup2
AND BUT BECAUSE A LAWSUIT IS

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:58.901 region:rollup2
THERE. YOU ARE ALSO LITIGANTS

01:08:57.033 --> 01:09:00.536 region:rollup2
AND ACTING LIKE LITIGANTS AS AS

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:03.373 region:rollup2
I WOULD EXPECT BUT THAT IS AND

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO FRUSTRATE.

01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:09.312 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL HERE WHICH IS TO GET.

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:11.014 region:rollup2
RELIABLE INFORMATION THIRD PARTY

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:13.282 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THE AUDITOR.

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:15.151 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT THE WAY THAT CGP

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:17.887 region:rollup2
OPERATES IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.521 region:rollup2
BUDGETARY AND POLICY DECISIONS

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.355 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO WORRY

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:21.557 region:rollup2
ABOUT AND NOT WORRY ABOUT.

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:23.393 region:rollup2
SO OUR GOAL IS NOT TO VARIOUS.

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:24.994 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL IS NOT TO.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:26.329 region:rollup2
FORCE YOU TO RELEASE RECORDS OF

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:28.031 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IT SEE THAT THAT YOU

01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:29.999 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT.

SUPPORT HEARING INSTEAD.

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:51.641 region:rollup2
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.409 region:rollup2
TRUTH IS NOT RELEVANT IN MY

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:54.777 region:rollup2
COURTROOM.

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:56.879 region:rollup2

SHOCK.

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:15.164 region:rollup2
MY BOTTOM LINE IS THAT.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:17.533 region:rollup2
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE CJ P.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:20.102 region:rollup2
NEEDS THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:21.671 region:rollup2

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:23.873 region:rollup2
