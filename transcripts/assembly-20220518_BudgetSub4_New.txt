IN MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I WENT ON THAT STATE WOULD HOUSING FOR THE FALL. WE WENT TO EVERYWHERE FROM CHICO TO INLAND EMPIRE TO FRESNO LA. AND EVERY SINGLE STOP. IT WAS RAISED WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- WE HEARD IT FROM EVERY COMMUNITY LARGE AND SMALL- AND SO IT'S AN OBVIOUS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF REDEVELOPMENT THAT'S- THAT A CHALLENGE FOR A LOT OF OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES- AND I KNOW THAT OUR STATE'S FLAGSHIP AFFORDABLE pGONNA RUN OUT OF FUNDS- AND I KNOW IT I THINK THERE'S JUST A REMAINING- TURNED FIFTY MILLION YEAR- SO I KNOW THE STATE'S OWN AND ARE THOSE ARE THE MINISTRATIONS OWN STATE WHAT HOUSING PLAN CALLS FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO MILLION NEW UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR.

PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR IN THE ACCELERATOR FUND WHICH WAS CREATED LAST YEAR TO CONSTRUCTION OF THIS. SO I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW. AS ONE LEGISLATOR WHO ALSO WAS TO BE THE HOUSING CHAIR- CALL FOR MORE FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LL KNOW WE NEED TO DO- YOU KNOW THEY SAY YOU ARE.

THAT WE VIEW IT AS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON OUR STREETS- IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES- URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL ARE FACING THIS CRISIS RIGHT NOW- AND SO THIS CRISIS I THINK WARRANT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. SIGNIFICANT ONGOING RESOURCES WHICH WILL BE A CONTINUED COMP A CONVERSATION I KNOW IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I KNOW THAT AGAIN HÃŒNH I KNOW THE GOVERNOR SAID A LOT IN THE SPACE BUT- I WOULD ASK FOR FORMER. MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE WE HAVE A GROWING. AND CATCHMENTS AND UNDERNEATH OUR- HIGHWAY OVERPASSES WE HAVE. CONSTITUENTS WERE LIVING IN THEIR CARS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE BARELY HANGING ON TO AFFORD RENT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR HOMES- IT'S SIMPLY NOT OK.

THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AMENDMENTS TO CREATE OR JUST BUDGET ITEMS- TO ACTUALLY EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENT THAT FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. SECOND ITEMS CONTROL SECTION. ELEVEN POINT NINETY ONE. THE GOAL OF THIS CONTROL SECTION IS TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF GENERAL FUND FOR OVER NINETEEN SPENDING- BY MAXIMIZING THE UE OF VARIOUS FEDERAL FUNDS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY OR FEMA. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND- TO COVER COVERT COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- AND THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A TOTAL OF TWO POINT THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR COVERT COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. ADMINISTRATION ALSO POSES SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES. TO BUDGET EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUNDING. THROUGH THE EMERGENCY. RELIEF FUND INSTEAD OF THE GENERAL FUND. THIRD AYE MR SECTION POINT NINE SIX- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE SIX TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY- TO MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO HOW THE STATE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS APPROPRIATED CALIFORNIA UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTS WERE TO BE EXPENDED- AND THEY REVISION MAKES TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING CHANGES- ALSO INCREASES THE- STATE.

AND WITH ME ARE MY COLLEAGUES FROM PARTNER FINANCE RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. SIR L. A. O. SKINNER PERCENT WRECKED. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GRANULAR FROM THE L. A. O. ALL RIGHT YOU'RE OVER THERE SORRY IS. FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY LA HOPE IS- BEFORE- MOVING TO OUR OUR COMMENTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL PROPOSAL JUST VERY BRIEFLY WANT TO OFFER A COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE KIND OF THE STRUCTURE THE MAY REVISION OVERALL. OVERALL THE MAY REVISION ALLOCATES FIFTY TWO BILLION AND A GENERAL FUND SURPLUS WITH THE LARGEST TWO CATEGORIES GOING TO NATURAL RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDES THIRTY NINE BILLION PROPOSALS TO ME A STATE APPROPRIATION LIMITS REQUIREMENTS AND THIS INCLUDES A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- IN TAX REFUNDS AND THIRTEEN BILLION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY- THE MIRRORS AND DOES LEAVE SOME SELL REQUIREMENTS UNADDRESSED IN PARTICULAR. A THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN REQUIREMENTS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND WE THINK- OVER TWENTY BILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND DOESN'T SET FORTH A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THOSE FUTURE REQUIREMENTS- WHICH WE THINK PRESENTS SOME RISKS TO THE THAT BUDGET PLAN- IN ADDITION WE SEE THAT CERTAIN. ECONOMIC INDICATORS THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE A SIGNALED- A RECESSION COULD BE ON THE RISE IN ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE BUDGET MAY BE FACING SOME DOWNSIDE RISK GOING FORWARD- GIVEN THESE FACTORS WE WOULD SUGGEST OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT RESERVES WILL BE ESSENTIAL. TO THE STATE AND MAINTAINING ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES GOING FORWARD- SO WITH THAT LET ME. MOVE THROUGH OUR COMMENTS ON A NUMBER OF THE ITEMS POSE HERE STARTING WITH OF THE CANNABIS PROPOSALS- WE THINK THE PROPOSALS TO MOVE- THE RETAIL EXCISE POINT OF COLLECTION AND TO ELIMINATE THE CULTIVATION TAX- MATCH RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'VE PREVIOUSLY MADE IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT- THE PER. RATE CHANGE FOR THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX IS PERHAPS MORE COMPLEX THAN WOULD BE IDEAL- THAT BEING SAID WE- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROPOSAL'S KALU TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN- KEEPING FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED OUT OF THESE REVENUES BUT HELPING LICENSE CANNABIS- THE LICENSE CANNABIS MARKET COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET. ON HOUSING- WE THINK THAT CONTINUES THEY FUNDING TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS IS. REASONABLE GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE STATE BUT WE THINK THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE. EXISTING PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCY IS AN APPROVED PROGRAM MINISTERED MINISTRATION AS OPPOSED TO PURSUING SOME OF THE NEW AND EXPANDED PROGRAMS THAT THE MAY REVISION SETS FORTH- IN ADDITION THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO. ALLOCATE HOUSING FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- UNDER THE CONSIDERATION OF SOME OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS ON THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER APPROPRIATING. ALL OF THE FUNDING THIS YEAR A TO BE DISPERSED OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THIS WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE. OF ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH IN NOW ON AN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GO TO HOUSING- AND SPREADING THAT BENEFIT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS- MORE OVER AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT COULD BE GAINED FROM THAT IS AS WE MENTIONED- IF IN FACT THE STATE DOES. START TO SEE SOME ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE YEARS IT IT COULD GAIN SOME BENEFIT AND HAVING ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS GOING INTO THE ECONOMY. IN THOSE IN THE FUTURE TIME PERIOD. ON A BROAD BAND- WE KNOW THAT THE BUDGET YEAR. THERE'S NO APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THERE'S NO ABOUT YOUR BILL OR OVER LANGUAGE THAT CODIFIES. THE OUT YOUR ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED. UNDER THE MAY REVISION- IN ADDITION THERE ARE OTHERS ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS COMING TO THE STATE IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. SOME ALLOWANCES FOR THOSE FUNDS TO FLOW INTO THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. ON GIVEN THESE FACTORS WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD- THE LADY MAKING ANY DECISIONS ON THESE APPROPRIATIONS- OR UNTIL NEXT YEAR. ON THE TAX BILL FLEXIBILITY- WE THINK THAT THE CONCEPT- DOES HAVE SOME MERIT- BUT WE FEEL THAT THE PERHAPS- LIKELY MODEST BENEFITS THE MOST TAXPAYERS- I CANNOT JUSTIFY THE RELATIVELY HIGH COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM IS ESTIMATED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROPOSED OUT REACH EFFORTS- WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- ONE PROPOSAL FOR FTV TO PROACTIVELY REACH OUT TO HOUSEHOLDS WHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR YET YOU SEE BUT DID NOT CLAIM IT. AND WHILE THIS SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE A REASONABLE PROPOSED- BASED ON PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO MAKE SIMILAR EFFORTS WE THINK IT'S LIKELY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE. ON THE PROPOSALS WITHIN GOBIZ TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RELIEF GRANTS TO BUSINESSES- THE STATE HAS MADE A CAN'T RELIEF GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES FOLLOWING AN APPROACH THAT PRIORITIZE. RAPID DISBURSEMENT OF ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES AND WE THINK THAT THAT WAS  WARRANTED AS A PRIORITY DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT- THAT APPROACH DID MAKE SOME TRADE OFFS IN THE YEARS OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE TARGETING AND WE THINK THAT APPROACH IS NO LONGER WARRANTED NOW THAT THE ECONOMY. HAS RECOVERED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE PANDEMIC AND SWEET- I. REJECTING ALLOCATING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE NEW HARD HIT INDUSTRIES GRANT PROGRAM SIMILARLY ON THE- RELIEF GRANTS- FOR AT DROUGHT- WE HAVE A SIMILAR CONCERN- THE PROPOSALS TO FOLLOW AGAIN A AND AN EMERGENCY MODEL THAT APPROACH IS GETTING THE FUNDING OUT RAPIDLY. AND GIVEN THAT DROUGHT IS A LONG STANDING PROBLEM FOR THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT KIND OF- THAT THAT APPROACH THAT PRIORITIZES RAPID DISBURSEMENT OVER THESE OTHER FACTORS IS APPROPRIATE AS AN APPROPRIATE MODEL FOR THAT FUNDING. ALL ON THE O. D. I. PROPOSAL WERE STILL REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL- IT GENERALLY APPEARS REASONABLE GIVEN THE OVERLAP. IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE ENTITIES WITH THEN GOV OPS. WE THINK THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND FINALLY ON THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY- PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS- IN. IN JANUARY WE NOTED THERE COULD BE SOME MERIT IN HAVING A PERSON WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER COORDINATE THE STATE'S EFFORTS. ARE OFTEN DISPARATE AND DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS- FOR PUBLIC AT REACH ACROSS STATE AGENCIES- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A LARGE NEW OFFICE WITHIN- PR- RAISES MANY CONCERNS FOR US IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE. TO MOVE- PUBLIC EVERYTHING ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DROUGHT- FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO. A NEW AGENCY AT OPR- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD DELAY THOSE OUT REJECTED BT'S AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEADMINISTRATION HAS ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED. OR TAKEN TAKEN STEPS TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES DOING SIMILAR OUTREACH. WITH THAT WERE HAPPENING ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS- MISTER COOPER YEAH I DO HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE MIDDLE MILE WE TALKED ABOUT- IS A FLEXIBILITY TO ALSO USE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE LAST MILE PROJECTS THERE'S A BIT THE SAME COST PRESSURES. CRISCO WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE- I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A COLLEAGUE ON THE LINE WHO COULD ANSWER THAT. BOB. HI THIS IS SCOTT ADAMS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF- BROADBAND AND DIGITAL LITERACY- STANDING UP FOR PARKMAN ROAD WHO SAID OVER AT THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING- YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION PLEASE. AS FAR AS THE FUNDING FOR THE FOR THE MIDDLE MILE IS OUR FLEXIBILITY BUT IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO SUPPORT THE LAST MILE PROJECTS THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THE SAME COST PRESSURES. I'M NOT TO SURE BACKUP NEW DEAD. ON EASY SUBMITTED BY BOB RELATED COST PRESSURES THE BELMONT. YOU'RE YOU'RE CUTTING OUT I GOT BITS AND PIECES OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID WAS SUBMITTED IT'S REALLY AREN'T AND WHY THEY MAY BE SIMILAR ON THE LINE MONTH THAT WE'RE GOING START AND WE'RE TO ASK YOU CARE OFF AND HOPEFULLY WERE ABLE TO pCRITICAL THAT OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE BROADBAND OR ABLE TO.

OKAY APOLOGIES THAT I HAD TO STEP OUT AND GO VOTE IN UTILITIES RIGHT NEXT DOOR- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE PROPOSALS PRESENTED TODAY WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH- HOMELESSNESS THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES A NEW PROPOSAL CALL THE INTERIM HOUSING PLACEMENTS THAT PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO ADDRESSED. UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS ON STATEOWNED LAND THROUGH TURKEY GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THERE IS NO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL DETAILING THE GRANTS THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS OR HOW THE PROPOSAL THE PROPOSAL AND PROGRAM WILL ROLL OUT CAN YOU PROVIDE MORE DETAILS. CRISCO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES- WELL ALLOW MY COLLEAGUE ON THE LINE TO- TO GET READY I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WE WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH STAFF AND WE'RE PREPARING TO HAVE MORE DETAIL WRITTEN TO SHARE AND PROVIDE- I STAFF ON THE COMMITTEE. BUT WHAT ASSET WHEN'S THE DEADLINE FOR YOU TO DO THAT. I COULD DO IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO. FINALIZING THE DOCUMENT NOW BUT I WILL ASK THAT MY COLLEAGUE AT FROM CALAIS C. H. H. C. D. TO PLEASE- ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE PROPOSAL WITH. IF THIS IS SUCH A CARD GAME ANDTHE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOUSING AT THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY AND I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS CRISIS OF WHAT WE'RE SPLIT IN THE OTHER HEARING- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR. OF THE PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE THE STATE ASSIST WITH THAT INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION FOR LAND SITE PREPARATION AND PROCUREMENT OF STRUCTURES THAT CAN BE USED TO EXPEDITE HOUSING PLACEMENT OPTIONS. REALLY TO ENSURE THAT UNSHELTERED. UNSHELTERED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON STATE RIGHT OF WAY. GET EXCEPT IT CAN'T MINCE INTO STABLE SUPPORTIVE INTERIM AND PERMANENT HOUSING SETTINGS I'M THIS WOULD INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THE STRUCTURES FUNDING FOR SITE PREPARATION WHEN REQUIRED. AND ALSO SERVICES COMPONENTS THE GRANTS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY EACH TV AND WE WOULD WORK IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH I. C. H. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BEST SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS CONTINUE TO STAY ALIGNED AND COORDINATED WITH THINGS EXISTING PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT MY CONCERN IS THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR I HAVE ASKED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON THE INCOMING GRAHAM PROCESS A PROCESS THAT HAD VERY LITTLE STRUCTURE AND STILL LEFT ME IN THE COMMITTEE WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS THE INCOMING GRAHAM PROGRAM HAD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT ADDITIONALLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW OUT OF THE WHAT IS ADDRESSED HERE **** STATE OWNED LAND WHICH IS CALTRANS PROPERTIES. WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF UN HOUSED INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO THE REST OF ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULARLY SKID ROW WHICH IS THE BIGGEST ENCAMPMENT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHICH IS NOT ON STATE PROPERTY. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I'M SURE I DO NOT HAVE THOSE STATISTICS AT THE READY I THINK THAT THE PIECE THAT I WOULD BUT WE CAN SHARE THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. THE PEACE. AFTER THAT AFTER THE HEARING TODAY- THE PIECE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO LIFT UP IS JUST THE URGENCY- AND THE- LACK OF SAFETY THAT EXISTS FOR. I'M SHELTERED INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE PARTICULARLY ON STATE RIGHT OF WAY BECAUSE IT IS A J. SENT. TO BE A KILLER TRAFFIC V. VERY FAST MOVING VEHICULAR TRAFFIC AT TIMES I'VE BEEN THIS IS RESIDENT WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SHARED ABOUT THE- THE LACK OF I'M NOT ONLY STABILITY AND BASIC SERVICES FOR FOLKS. I'M LIVING THERE BUT ALSO JUST SPECIFICALLY FOLKS THAT- ARE SO ADJACENT TO ROADWAYS SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S THIS FOCUS HERE ON MAKING SURE THAT B. I'M STATE IS ADDRESSING ENCAMPMENTS ON ITS OWN LAND AND WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH LOCALS I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S WAYS TO EXIT. SAFELY THANK YOU I DON'T THINK THE WEARER DEBATING THE MERITS OF. ENSURING THAT SAFETY IS A PRIORITY ON. ON RIGHT AWAY IS ON FREEWAYS ON CALTRANS PROPERTY WHERE ASKING FOR THE DETAILS AS TO HOW THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT. AND COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF IN HOUSE INDIVIDUALS ON RIGHT OF WAYS VERSUS THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. NOT ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY. YES I UNDERSTAND AND THANK YOU FOR THAT- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS ON STATE RIGHT OF WAY OR IN THE THOUSANDS I DO NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON IN. ON CAN'T MEDS AND SKID ROW OR IN OTHERS AREAS AT THE READY. THE WAY THAT THIS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED I AM IS REALLY. THROUGH EACH TV THAT THE GRANTS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BUT AS I MENTIONED- KELLY C. H. BRINGING THEIR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE. ACCORDING TO SHIN WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING SOME ACCOUNTABILITY- COMPONENTS BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AS YOU JUST STATED- ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD BE PARTNERING CAN ABOUT A STRIKE TEAM BASIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE CAN ASSIST WITH PROCUREMENT OF STRUCTURES. IDENTIFIED STATE OF LAND FOR CITING- AND WORK TO PROVIDE- OVERSIGHT OF SITE IMPROVEMENTS IF LOCALITIES NEEDED THAT SUPPORT. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS WOULD BE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WHERE PEOPLE ARE I'M AT THE ELIGIBLE USES COULD BE THOSE STRUCTURES FOR RAPID OR INTERIM SHELTER SITE PREPARATION INCLUDING ELECTRICAL OR SANITATION LAND ACQUISITION IF NEEDED AND SERVICES FOR UP TO THREE YEARS. THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST DID A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH WHILE LISTENING TO YOUR PRESENTATION AND CALMATTERS HAS AN ARTICLE BASED ON THE LAST CALIFORNIA COUNT WHICH PUT THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT ARE ON HOUSE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU DO THAT THE SAME SEARCH FOR SKID ROW IT'S OF MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE ON HOUSE ON SKID ROW SO AS WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO ADDRESSED UNSHELTERED. INDIVIDUALS ON STATE OWNED LANDS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED PRIORITIZE WHERE THE NEEDS ARE THE MOST- WHICH AS MENTIONED SKID ROW IS THE BIGGEST ENCAMPMENT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WHERE THESE FINDINGS ARE GOING TO GO ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN DO A COMPARISON ANALYSIS A TO HOW MANY FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY ON. STATEMENT THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH- I JUST WONDER IF I MAY WOULD JUST MENTION ONE MORE THING AND THAT THIS IS NOT CERTAINLY AS YOU KNOW WELL THIS IS NOT THE ONLY STRATEGY THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD OR ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS- AND WORKING WITH ENCAMPMENTS AROUND THE STATE. SO THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT SOLUTION ONE WHERE AS YOU MENTIONED WE ALL WILL NOT BE DEBATING THE MERITS OR THE NEED FOR BRINGING PEOPLE INTO MORE SAVE SITUATIONS- BUT REALLY AS ANOTHERIMPORTANT TOOL FOR A VERY CRITICAL NEED- WE WEEK WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DATA AS YOU REQUESTED. THANK YOU AND IF WE CAN FOLLOW UP AS TO I ASKED IN THIS LAST COMMITTEE AS WELL- THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DID APPLY FOR A GRANT FOR I BELIEVE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP WITH THE ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS GET ROW. AND I AM TALKING ABOUT SKID ROW SPECIFICALLY AS THE CITY OF LOS WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IT IS NOT IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY BUT IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND WITH THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC BOOM IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES SKID ROW CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT CONTINUES TO GROW OUTSIDE OF SKID ROW AND IT'S NOW GROWING. IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS BEING THE HIGHEST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE TALKING ABOUT I THINK IT BE IMPERATIVE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON BE BIGGEST ENCAMPMENT. WHICH IS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IN OUR OWN STATE IN MY OWN BACKYARD IN LOS ANGELES. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- pTO KNOW. A REASON AS TO WHY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WAS NOT GRANTED THAT SIXTEEN MILLION. GRANT FOR ENCAMPMENTS. AND FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION. THAT ULTIMATELY ALSO HELPS- NAVIGATORS ACROSS A SKID ROW IN PARTICULAR. THANK YOU I'M I MAY HAVE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE ON FROM OUR INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS BUT I'M OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNCIL IS IN THE SENATE. HEARING SO AT VICTOR ARE YOU ON AND DID WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD RELATED TO. THIS YEAR. YES ARBITRON YOUR GRANTS DIRECTOR WITH CALA SPEECH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MANAGER ON- SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DESIGNING INTO THE NEXT ROUND TRIP IN CAMDEN RESOLUTION GRANTS AS WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY PRIORITIZED- A FUNDING THOSE PROPOSALS THAT WERE NOT FUNDED DURING THE FIRST ROUND I'VE ALREADY HAD A WONDERFUL VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE LOS ANGELES- WITH THE FOLKS WHO PRESS AMID THE PROPOSAL FROM LOS ANGELES FOR SKID ROW- AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT- PROPOSAL AND SOME NEXT STEPS. AND ASSURING THAT IF THE- FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN KEVIN RESOLUTION- PART TWO WHERE TO MOVE FORWARD THEY WOULD BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE- FOR HAVING THAT. HAVING A PROPOSAL FUNDED- AS YOUR ALL THE WHERE THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM'S ONLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- WE WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED THREE TIMES OVER WHAT WAS AVAILABLE- AND ONE OF THE IT WAS COMPETITIVELY- SCORED APPLICATION IT WAS NOT. BASED ON POPULATION NEED LIKE SOME OF OUR OTHER BLOCK GRANT FORMULA ARE- AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF COURSE WAS TO SUPPORT AS MUCH GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE- AWARDS AS POSSIBLE- AND WE GET AWARD PROPOSALS FOR TO OUR PROPOSALS IN L. A. COUNTY ONE IN LONG BEACH AND ONE IN THE CITY OF LA AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUING TO WORK WITH CITY OF LA- TO FIND ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS AS NEW RESOURCES COME ONLINE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. WELL WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SAYS AS NEEDED THEN THANK YOU WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS ON HOUSING CAN FINANCE EXPLAINED THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO HOUSING WHAT IS THE GOAL BY LAYERING THESE GOALS OVER THE EXISTING PROGRAM WHO DECIDES WHAT AND HOW. THE GOALS WORK. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SO THE HOUSING TRADABLE INTENT IS TO- IDENTIFY SOME PRIORITY AREAS IN THE STATE MANY OF THOSE WHICH ARE ALREADY EXISTING- I BELIEVE ALL OF THEM ARE EXISTING HOUSING POLICY GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE- REDUCE SEEN EM TEA AND THE CLIMATE FOCUSED OBJECTIVE SO THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS MORE- INTENDED TO BRING THOSE ALL TOGETHER AND USES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME OF THE STATE PROGRAMS AND HOUSING. TO POINT TO AND TO IDENTIFY THOSE HOUSING PRIORITY AREAS AND TO BE USED. AS THE GOALS THAT THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SAYS THAT THIS POLICY WOULD GO INTO EFFECT JULY OF JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. HAS THIS POLICY BEEN VETTED ANYWHERE- OR WITH ANY STAKEHOLDERS AND IF SO WITH WHOM COLLEAGUES FROM- THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH ON THE LINE IF THEY'VE HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH ANY STAKEHOLDERS. HONEST LANGUAGE. THIS IS CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS NEW IN TARA KEEP FROM OPR YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. RIGHT YES I AM I DO NOT HAVE. INFORMATION ON THAT IMMEDIATELY AT HAND BUT WE WILL FOLLOW UP TO GET INFORMATION ON THAT QUESTION. IS THERE SOMEONE THAT YOU CAN CALL THAT MAY HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON HAND FOR THIS HEARING. HI SORRY ABOUT THAT. ISSUE AND YET LET ME REACH OUT TO A COLLEAGUE HERE AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A RESPONSE JUST ONE JUST ONE MINUTE. SHARKS. THE REQUESTED MR COOPER- I WANNA GO BACK ON SOMETHING I FORGOT TO ASK EARLIER CHARLOTTE FALL DATE LET'S GIVE THEM SOME TIME TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AND YOU CAN ASK YOUR QUESTION AS WELL THANK YOU. THE OTHER CANNABIS TAX PROPOSAL COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF IT. AND GO MORE IN DEPTH ON THAT. SURE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS ON THE LINE. HI NICOLE ELLIOTT DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT CAMPUS PLAN TO BE HERE WITH YOU GUYS TODAY I'M ALSO JOINED BY NICK MADURO'S- I BELIEVE OR SEND YOU WILL SEND FROM THAT COMPANY DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. I HAD TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE IF EITHER OF THEM ARE ON THE LINE WHICH WE ARE DOING DOUBLE DUTY AND BOTH AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS RIGHT NOW. YES THIS IS NICK WITH- SOME ONLINE. THANK YOU NICK WOULD YOU LIKE TO WALK THROUGH THE TAX PROPOSAL. SURE SO A SITE TESTIFIED I RECENTLY- WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AROUND THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE- CANNABIS TAXES AND STATE- AND RECOMMENDED THAT WE BOTH SIMPLIFY THE TAX STRUCTURE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR TAXPAYERS- SIMPLER FOR CONSUMERS AND FRANKLY- ENABLE OUR TEAM TO BETTER MINISTER THE TAX- THAT CANNABIS TAXES. AS WELL AS TO ADD ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- WORK MOST EFFECTIVELY TO- ADDRESSED THE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET- THAT WE FIND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO- THE PROPOSAL WOULD MOVE THE EXCISE TAX WHICH IS THE 15% TAX- FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR TO THE RETAILER WHICH IS- THE WAY THE TAX WAS STRUCTURED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR- THAT WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS- FIRST IT WOULD ALIGN BETTER LINE THE TAX WITH. PROP SIXTY FOUR IT WOULD ELIMINATE THIS- SITUATION WE HAVE CURRENTLY WHERE WE- COME UP WITH IT- AVERAGE STATEWIDE MARKUP RATE. TWICE A YEAR- THAT RESULTS FRANKLY IN WILDLY VARYING TAX RATES- FOR VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE AND IT'S VERY CONFUSING- TO CONSUMERS AND RETAILERS- WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD RESULT IN BY MANY FEWER REPORTING ERRORS ON OUR RETURNS- IT WILL MAKE OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD- AS WELL AS ALLOW US TO. LEVERAGE OUR VERY LARGE SALES AND USE TAX- JEAN TO ALSO TRY TO ADDRESS THE- PROBLEMS IN THE CAMPUS MARKET SINCE. THE CANNABIS RETAILERS ARE SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS SO WE'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH THEM ON SALES AND USE- AND FURTHERMORE IT- THE MOVE MOVING THIS TO THE POINT OF SALE- WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF THE DISPUTES THAT WE'RE- IN BETWEEN. JUST AND RETAILERS ABOUT WHO IN FACT DOES THE TAXES AND- WHETHER OR NOT THE DISTRIBUTORS HAVE BEEN- GIVEN THE MONEY FOR THE TAXES AND WOOD- I BELIEVE THAT THIS REALLY STREAMLINED THE THIS SITUATION FOR US IN THE ENFORCEMENT PIECES ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IT WOULD SIMPLY GIVE US THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE IN OTHER TAX PROGRAMS INCLUDING SALES AND USE TAX. AS WELL AS IN OUR- TOBACCO TAX PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE TAXES- YOU COMPLAIN I CAN GOING TO THOSE IN MORE DETAIL IF YOU'D LIKE BUT- THEY'RE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD- AND ALIGN OUR CANNABIS TAXES WITH THOSE OTHER. TAXES. THANK YOU. I KNOW WE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE LAST YEAR AND ADJUSTED AND ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC. ON THE- THE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND INTERVENTION TREATMENT. IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY LAST YEAR WHAT IT WAS. I THINK THEY DIDN'T GIVE ALL THEY GASSER ARE COMPLETE ANSWER WHAT WHAT THAT DID SPECIFICALLY. CAN SOMEONE COME ALONG THAT. HI THIS IS KIMBERLY HARVEST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE A- DOCUMENT THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH COMMITTEE STAFF MOVED OVER TO YOU ON WHAT YOU TO THE DEPARTMENTS DO WHAT THAT FUNDING. CAN YOU TELL ME THAT REYNELLA- I DON'T HAVE AT HAND I'M SORRY. BUT BUT IT IS THE THREE BUCKETS A 60% FOR THE YOUTH EDUCATION TREATMENT PREVENTION. 20% FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION AND THEN 20% OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OF SAFETY. SURE SO I'D LIKE TO BROKEN ON THAT ALSO THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE WHAT IT DID FOR THERE WAS DIFFERENT LAST TIME WAS THIS TIME ALSO. IF YOU COULD READ THAT ALSO ON THE EDUCATION PORTION. OKAY WILL PROVIDE THAT TO YOU- EITHER THIS AFTERNOON OR TOMORROW. OKAY THANK YOU. THE REPORT. THANK YOU. I REGARDING THE PROPOSED CANNABIS RETAIL GRANT PROGRAM WHAT WOULD BE THE TIMELINE TO ROLL OUT THIS PROGRAM IS THERE AN ANTICIPATED ANTICIPATED DEADLINE. FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO APPLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- WE WOULD ANTICIPATE IF APPROVED WOULD SEEK TO- ISSUE THE SOLICITATION FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND I'M CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE I SHOULD SAY. SPENDING THE SIX MONTHS BETWEEN JULY FIRST AND THEEND OF THE YEAR WORKING WITH- ELIGIBLE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS. SO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION THE ANTICIPATED DEADLINE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO APPLIES WITHIN CLARIFICATION THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE GUIDELINE PROCESS THAT WE WOULD BE DEVELOPING WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS BUT WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE WORKING IN EARNEST TO ENSURE THAT THAT SOLICITATION PROCESS. I IS PRETTY SWIFT SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT WE STRUCTURE IT ARTICLE JURISDICTION ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET I WOULD OPEN IT CLOSED IN. TWO MONTHS. THANK YOU AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT BE ABLE TO INCLUDE IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AN UPDATE ON THE JURISDICTIONS THAT APPLIED AND WHERE THE AWARDS WERE GRANTED. ABSOLUTELY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE TWO SIX ONE NINE ZERO DOES REQUIRE US REPORT ANNUALLY STARTING IN MARCH FIRST OF NEXT YEAR WE CAN- VERY HAPPILY I INCLUDE DATES ON THIS PROGRAM AS PART OF THAT. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO. BREAK DOWN THE JURISDICTIONS BETWEEN ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS. OR HOW IS IN CHECK HOW HOW IS A BROKE INTO. I SAW IT WOULD BE PER CITY OR COUNTY- I THINK WE CAN INDICATE IN THAT- REPORTING STRUCTURE WHICH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ASSOCIATED WITH I THOUGHT I WOULD BE. YEAH THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF YOU'RE ABLE TO INCLUDE THAT. AND LASTLY JUST TO KIND OF ECHO MR COOPER'S QUESTION HOW WAS THE DETERMINED. A FOR THAT QUESTION I WILL DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI THIS IS KIMBERLY HARVESTING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE 19% IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE TAX RATE IS NOW BECAUSE THE TAX RATE IS CURRENTLY. ABOUT FOUR IT'S 4% FOR CULTIVATION WHICH WE ARE ZEROING OUT AND IT'S 15% EXCISE TAX. SO IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE BETWEEN HELP THINKING OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE COME INTO THE LEGAL MARKET WE WANT TO SUPPORT THEM BY GIVING THEM A TAX BREAK BY LOWERING THE CULTIVATION IMMEDIATELY AND- PROVIDE THAT WE'RE ALSO COGNIZANT THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS. AS MEDICAL PREVENTION TO THAT RELY ON FUNDING FROM THE ALLOCATION THREE PART OF THE TAX REVENUE SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE. BETWEEN THE PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS BUT ALSO LOWERING THE TAX- ARDEN ON FOLKS WITH THE IDEA THAT IF THE TAXES ARE LOWER THE HOPE IS THAT THEY'LL BE MORE. LEGAL CANNABIS SOLD SO THAT THE OVERALL REVENUE. REMAINS ABOUT THE SAME AND THEN WE'VE ALSO- ARE PROPOSING A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. GENERAL FUND BACK FILL TO SORT OF MITIGATE ANY. LOWER REVENUE IF NEEDED AND THEN THE TAX RATE CHANGE- BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND NINETEEN PERCENT. IS ANOTHER MITIGATION STRATEGY. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATE THE ANSWER. CAN WE GO BACK TO. OF BACK TO HOUSING TO THE QUESTION ON STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT. DO WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL ONLINE. FIVE IS NEWMAN TARA KEY AGAIN FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH AND WE HAVE DONE SOME PRELIMINARY OUTRAGE I DON'T HAVE THE LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WHAT THAT ENGAGEMENT HAS LOOKED LIKE- WE HAVE DONE NO FORMAL IN ABOUT REGION ENGAGEMENT EFFORT BUT- I CAN CIRCLE WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO. GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE CAN SHARE THAT IN THAT- AS A FOLLOW UP. OKAY THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT IF WE CAN HAVE THAT INFORMATION PLEASE. LET'S MOVE ONTO A DIFFERENT TOPIC AGO THIS. CAN GO BATES EXPLAINED THE GRANTS FOR THE HARD OF FOR THE HARD HIT BUSINESSES HOW WAS THE PROGRAM SIZED AND HOW WILL CAL ALWAYS BE A ENSURE. THAT IT IS ADMINISTERED EQUITABLY THIS THE PROGRAM ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION BRIAN RUTLEDGE BUDGET OFFICER. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO IN TERMS OF THIS SIZE THE ADMINISTRATION WAS TRYING TO. REVISED SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WE KNOW THAT- BUSINESSES THAT WERE THE HARDEST HIT AT SPECIFICALLY FOOD SERVICES ACCOMMODATION THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT SAW DRAMATIC LOSSES IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF JOBS THAT WENT AWAY BUT UNDER COBIT. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE AND TO DRIVE THE RECOVERY SO THAT'S THE IMPETUS FOR THIS PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF THE SIZING ARE WE ANTICIPATE THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AWARDS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES- THERE IS AVAILABLE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS SO- WE DO BELIEVE THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION UP DEMAND OUT THERE AN ELIGIBILITY- BUT THAT'S IN TERMS OF HOW WE GOT TO THE FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION SO IN TERMS OF EQUITY WE THIS COMMITTEES FOCUS ON EQUITY- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WE KNOW THAT'S A PRIORITY ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY SHARES THAT AND HELLO IT'S BE A- THE DIRECTOR APOLOGIES- APOLOGIZES COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. BUT SHE SHE SHARES THAT SO WITH THIS PROGRAM THE HARD HIT INDUSTRIES. THE WAY WE WOULD ENSURE THAT EQUITY AND INCLUSION IT IS BIG TEN YEARS WE WOULD LEVERAGE THE COBIT RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS- AND OTHER EXISTING PRACTICES THAT ESSENTIALLY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE DEVELOPED- IN IN GETTING OUT GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES FOR RELIEF. I WOULD ALSO DO CAMPAIGNS MEDIA CAMPAIGNS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SORT OF WORKED OUT AND ARE. MOVING TOWARDS A SUCCESSFUL MODEL SO WE WOULD BASICALLY BE LEVERAGING THE COMPANY RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM. TRYING TO USE THE NETWORKS AND THE PRACTICES WE- WE'VE SEEN THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING AWARENESS UP. AND ALSO ENSURES THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE A MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION. THAT WHILE ALL LEAVE IT THERE BUT- HAPPY TO ADD ANYTHING IF THAT'S HELPFUL. DO YOU THINK THAT THE PROGRAM WILL BE OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE DO THINK THE AWFUL FIVE HUNDRED WILL GO OUT AND PROBABLY YOU KNOW RELATIVELY QUICKLY- THERE'S BEEN- THE THOUGH THE WAY IT'S GONE IS IT'S NOW. THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS OF FUNDING THROUGH THE COVERED RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM SO WE HAVE A SENSE OF. THAT THE TIMING ON HOW THOSE WAYS OF FINDING GO OUT. AND IN RECENT MONTHS THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOWDOWN WHICH DOES MAKE US THINK THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED. I IS A PRETTY GOOD- ESTIMATE FOR TERMS OF IT WOULDN'T GO OUT DAY ONE IT'S NOT IS IT- GOING TO THE FULL. VALUE WOULD BE MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED SO WERE WE DON'T CLAIM THAT THIS IS THE PERFECT NUMBER BUT WE DO CLAIM IT'S- I PRETTY. SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT AND THAT THE THAT IN OUR OVERALL FISCAL RESILIENCY DESIGN IS- IT SORT OF. MAKES SENSE. OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW IN IN OUR LAST HEARING WE DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE EXTEND OPPORTUNITIES TO BUSINESSES AND OUTRAGE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER THE SAME BUSINESSES THAT HAVE ALREADY. APPLIED OR HAVE KNOWLEDGE AS TO HOW TO APPLY BUT REALLY. ALSO INCLUDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DIFFERENT CULTURES. TO ENSURE THAT THEY TOO ARE ALSO PART OF. THE CONVERSATION ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY. YEAH I'LL JUST ECHO THAT POINT AND KNOW THAT CALLAWAY'S BA IS DEFINITELY TAKING THAT. INTO CONSIDERATION THAT'S BEEN THEIR GOAL AND THERE HAS BEEN A LEARNING CURVE BUT IT WORKED WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE- YEAH RICH HERE IS ALREADY IN PLACE THE TO THE NETWORKS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NONPROFITS. REYES PARTNERS TO HELP GET THE WORD OUT AND SO WE'RE- WE WOULD BE EXCITED BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S A- THERE'S BEEN. SUCH A NETWORK BUILT UP THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED HER. I BELIEVE THAT I HAD ASKED IN A PREVIOUS HEARING AND FORGIVE ME IF THERE WAS SHARED AND I'LL JUST ASK AGAIN. IF WE CAN PUT YOU CAN PROVIDE A LIST OF ALL THE- NOT OFFICE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT YOU POTENTIALLY WORK IN OUR WORK WITH. THE CAN HELP WITH THIS PROGRAM AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. I APPRECIATE THAT ALL I CAN I CAN GET BACK TO YOU- I DON'T WE HAVE NOT SHARE THAT SENSE- MY APOLOGIES IF THAT WAS- MISTAKE BUT BUT ESSENTIALLY WE CAN ALL GET BACK TO YOU. GREAT THANK YOU- AND MOST RECENTLY I WAS REALLY ALARMED. TO HEAR THE PROPOSAL WHICH WAS LATER WITHDRAWN. TO FUND INSTACART WITH A CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX SUBSIDY. DOES THE GOVERNOR'S NEW CAL COMPETES PACKAGE INCLUDE PROVISIONS TO FOCUS THE SUBSIDIES ON COMPANIES. WITH STRONG LABOR COMPLIANCE INCLUDING. PROPERLY CLASSIFYING WORKERS AVOIDING WAITSTAFF AND COMPLYING WITH OSHA STANDARDS. SIR GOBIZ DEFINITELY IGNORE ALL AGES THE CONCERN- WE KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE- HEARD AND TALKED CLOSELY WITH. SPECIFICALLY ON THE ASSEMBLY SITE IN GENERAL THE LEGISLATIVE. FOLKS THAT WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND HAVE- THOUGHT CLOSELY ABOUT THIS INTERNALLY. BEAT THE PACKAGE WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD FOR KHALKHIN PETE'S. DOES NOT HAVE A NEW. FRAMEWORK OF ANY SORT TO THE PROGRAM ITSELF IN TERMS OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY OTHER SOME OTHER TWEAKS I TO THE PROGRAM OR PROPOSING THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE INSTACART. SPECIFICALLY BUT WE HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS WE'VE- WE'VE BEEN PROCESSING INTERNALLY AND WE ARE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY I THINK THAT IT'S A HERE. I'M GLAD THAT IS BEING NOTED BUT IF I AM GOING TO BE JUST SPECIFICALLY VERY CLEAR. THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WOULD NOT BE IN AGREEMENT WITH CAL COMPETE SUBSIDIES GOING TO COMPANIES THAT DO NOT HAVE STRONG LABOR PROTECTIONS COOL MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS AND WERE PART OF A LARGE A LARGER CONVERSATION RELATED TO WAIT WAIT STAFF AND NON COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA. SO I HOPE THAT THAT CLEAR IN THE DIRECTION OF ANY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD. DEFINITELY HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR SUB APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU- MISS WICKS YOU WANTED TO GO BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION- QUESTION ON HOUSING YEAH AN APOLOGIES FOR. GOING BACK AND FORTH HERE- I BELIEVE WHEN I WAS OUT I THINK ELIADE SUGGESTED- INVESTING IN MULTI YEAR FUNDING- I WAS NOT IN THE ROOM NOW SO I WAS TOLD THAT BUT I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE- IF SO I AGREE- AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK D. O. F. YOU KNOW IF YOU ALL AGREE WITH. THE PREMISE THAT WE NEED SOME SORT OF ON GOING FUNDING TO TACKLE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE. AND IF SO WOULD YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION A VIABLE PATH FOR THAT ONGOING FUNDING. SO I. ADDED MORE BROADLY THE BUDGET IS YOU KNOW PRECARIOUSLY BALANCED- IT WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF OUT YOUR SPENDING BY I BELIEVE IT THAT NUMBER WAS IS LIKE NINETY SOMETHING 9597% OF THE FINDING. IS IN ONE TIME- INVESTMENTS SO I DON'T THINK THE COMMITMENT FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR HOUSING PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT. IS WITHIN THAT THAT LARGER BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK. BUT DEFINITELY IF YOUR QUESTION IS MORE OF HOW WE CAN DISTRIBUTE. THE HOUSING FUNDING. UNLOCKS THE YEARS I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WERE OPEN TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT. AND IF NOT THEN ON GOING WHAT ABOUT A SORT OF DEFINED APPEARED OF TIME TO GIVE THIS A LONG ENOUGH RUNWAY TO REALLY SERVE TACKLE THE PROBLEM. YEAH I MEAN AGAIN I WOULD JUST SAY IT OPENED OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT FUNDING. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WICKS LET'S MOVE ON TOWARDS EDT. I UNDERSTAND EDT NEXT AIMS TO MODERNIZE THE ENTIRE CLAIM EXPERIENCE CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THIS PROPOSAL IMPACTS THE VENDOR PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. YES AND IS DIRECTOR FERRIES ON THE LINE THEY CAN HELP I AM THANK YOU NANCY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS- NEED TO VARIOUS WITH EDT SO CURRENTLY- THE VENDORS THAT WE HAVE IN THE JAN TEN PER PROPOSAL. FOR MAINTAINING THE SUPPORT THAT WE'VE USED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SOME OF THESE WILL EVENTUALLY MERGE INTO EDT NEXT- BUT FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE TIME BEING WE STILL NEED THINGS LIKE ACCENTURE TO COMPLETE. SOME OF THE CSA RECOMMENDATIONS- WE ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MODERNIZE AT THE SAME TIME WE CALL IT CARILLO MODERNIZATION- TO BE PREPARED FOR A RECESSION OR- SOME SORT OF AN UNEMPLOYMENT SEARCH- OF COURSE CONSISTENT WITH THE CS AT EIGHT AND STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS- JUST TO SORT OF WRAP IT UP SOME OF THESE. VENDORS WILL LIKELY BE REPLACED AS WE ROLL OUT YOU'D NEXT- WERE FINISHING UP THE CSA CSA RECOMMENDATIONS AS THE COMPS COMMITTEE IS AWARE- AND AT SOME POINT THESE THINGS WILL MERGE I YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE VENDOR BCPS FROM JAN TEN. ARE TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW AND EDT NEXT IS FOR THE FUTURE AND FOR THE TOMORROW OF EDT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'VE AFTER THE BCPS PROBABLY THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS MOST OF THIS WILL PROBABLY BE ROLLED INTO EDT NEXT. ENTER VERY I AM SORRY I MISSED THE ANSWER BUT- WHAT EXACTLY IS THE IMPACT TO THE VENDOR PROPOSALS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IF ANY AT ALL- SO EASY THE NEXT EATING NEXT IS A SEPARATE PROPOSAL THAN THE JAN TEN PROPOSAL SO WE NEED TO JAN TEN PROPOSALS TO MOVE WHAT WE'RE DOING. NOW YOU KNOW I'M UPDATING- LANGUAGE ACCESS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN JAN TEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PANDEMIC TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE READY. FOR A RECESSION BECAUSE EDT NEXT AS A FIVE YEAR PROJECT. AND SO WE THAT'S WITH THOSE BCPS FOR THREE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO GAP. IN IN SOME OF THE MODERNISATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING. EBS TWO EDT NEXT BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED. Q. AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL ANTICIPATED COST OF THE MODERNIZATION PROJECT. SO IT'S I'M SORRY CHRIS DID YOU WANNA GO FOR A HER JOURNAL SO YEAH. SO THAT TOTAL- THE TOTAL PROJECTED AMOUNT IS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR ONE TIME COSTS WHICH IS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROADMAP OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THERE ARE OTHER COSTS THAT ARE- SEVERAL YEARS OF MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT EDT NEXT DURING THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD. THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION SO IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. TOTAL THANK YOU THANK YOU YOU KNOW I'D- THERE ARE MOMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE WHERE I HEAR THE BILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW AND ABOVE AND IT'S SUCH A JUST A JUST A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS OUR- THE CURRENT SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND RIDE IT MAY BE THE ONLY. MOMENT THAT WE ALL LIVE THROUGH WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUMS THE SUMS OF MONEY. SO THAT JUST. YOU KNOW JUST A MOMENT OF REFLECTION HERE. AT DIRECTOR VARIOUS HOW MANY LANGUAGES ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY EDT AND HOW MANY ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE ARE PLANNED TO BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE CONVERSATION EFFORT. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE I BELIEVE SIX LANGUAGES THAT HAVE DIRECT PHONE LINES ANSWERED BY EDT STAFF. THAT BASICALLY DOES NOT SPEAK THOSE LANGUAGES WE ALSO HAVE A LANGUAGE LINE. THAT PROVIDE INTERPRETER SERVICES- IN OVER ONE HUNDRED LANGUAGES- A LOT OF THIS IS THANKS TO AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT THIS COMMITTEE- WE ALL REMEMBER THAT VERY WELL FROM LAST YEAR THAT- AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. THE CALL CENTER COURSE- AND I LANGUAGE ACCESS AND EDT NEXT IS REALLY GOING TO LEVERAGE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING RIGHT NOW PER AB ONE THIRTY EIGHT WE ALSO HAD A- MEDIATION- THAT SORT OF MERIT ONE THIRTY EIGHT. SO GOING TO LEVERAGE THOSE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING NOW- AND JUST BUILD UPON THEM AT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE ALL ENHANCEMENTS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY PRIORITIES AS I THINK THIS COMMITTEE- KNOWS WELL- AND I CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DOING SOON IF YOU'D LIKE OR LEAVE IT AT THAT. THANK YOU DIRECTOR- INTERFERE HEARING THIS COMMITTEE OUTLINED CONCERNS WITH ID ME AND THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO ADDRESS THE PRIVACY. WHAT'S WITH ID ME SO THEY DO NOT USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY UNLESS THE CLAIMANT WANTS TO BASICALLY SO THEY- NOW THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT YOU CAN USE A TRUSTED REFEREE. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH ID ME WHICH IS A LIVE PERSON ON THE OTHER THING THAT- DELETING THE SELFIE SO IF YOU DO CHOOSE TO TAKE A SELFIE- NUMBER ONE THEY ARE NO LONGER USING THE ONE TO MANY RECOGNIZE FACIAL RECOGNITION- SO IT'S ONE TO ONE- I BELIEVE THAT IT'S CALLED. AND ONCE YOU TAKE A SELFIE AND UPLOAD IT- ID NY IT WILL DELETE THEM- RIGHT RIGHT AFTER THEY ARE APPROVED BASICALLY. SO IT WAS IT WAS THAT I MENTIONED THAT THE IRS ALSO ASKED FOR THE SAME. SAME THINGS FOR MY TEAMMATES. SO I BELIEVE THOSE ARE THREE CHANGES TO THE IDB PROGRAM THE DELETION OF THE SELFIE BEING A REFEREE- S. LIVE PERSON INDIVIDUAL AND THE FIRST ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED. THAT ONE TOO MANY. THAT WAS THE STAR OF SORT OF SOME CONTENTION ABOUT- ID ME USING PHOTOS AGAINST OTHER PHOTOS OF PEOPLE BUT THEY LONGER DO THAT GOT IT OKAY.

I WILL SAY I AND I THINK YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT HOME HE DOES HAVE A SET ASIDE. FOR A REQUIREMENT. FOR YOUTH HOUSING AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE'S A SET ASIDE IN THE HOT FUNDING. FOR YOUTH- AS WELL BUT VICTOR IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC IN THE PLANS FOR THE AND CAN'T MAKE GRANTS- FOR YOUTH. EXCUSE ME THAT'S THE SUBJECT AGAIN DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOUSING FROM B. C. S. H. VICTOR HAD TO STEP AWAY FOR A MOMENT IF WE COULD COME BACK TO THIS- BUT I. APPRECIATE WHAT CHRIS COOK SHARED ABOUT THE FOCUS WITHIN THE HUNKY PROGRAM THAT'S FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AND THAT SET ASIDE IS ALREADY SHOWING SHOWN A LOT OF- BENEFIT- IN THAT WE'RE FUNDING TRANSITION AGED YOUTH UNITS- AND REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT COMPONENT. I'M VICTOR ARE YOU BACK ON YET. APOLOGIES CARE AND YES YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST HOLDEN LITERALLY TWO DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT NOW TO APPRECIATE YOUR NOT PRETENDING HE'S- TRYING TO GET BACK IN. NOT A PROBLEM I'M HAPPY TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND THE TWO GUYS COMMUNICATE WHEN HE'S BACK AND WE CAN REVISIT THE QUESTION. OUT WE CAN GO AT THIS TIME TO A QUESTION I HAVE ON KELLY ATC. SO REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE TEN MILLION AND ONGOING FUNDING BUT- NOT ENOUGH WONDERING IF THERE'S- A SOMEONE THAT CAN SPEAK ON. THE NEED TOWARDS- THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED IN THIS COMMITTEE BEEN A FOR. TOWARDS OUTREACH PLANS- THAT ACTUALLY BENEFIT. THE ABILITY FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BECOME I TEND TAX HOLDERS AND THEREFORE GET OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR KELLY ITC. RIGHT SO BEFORE I ASK ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM F. T. B. THE JUMP ON AS NOTED THAT- IN THE L. A. WAS TESTIMONY THERE IS ALSO- OUT REACH FUNDING AT F. T. B. TO DO THEIR OWN- INTERNAL KELLY AT ATC OUR REGION I THINK I NOTED IN MY OVERVIEW- THERE IS A DEDICATED STAFF AT- FTV. TO DO OUTREACH AND THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE TEN MILLION AS AS YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT FOR THE ON GOING FUNDING SO THE THERE HAS BEEN- OKAY. CONCERNS SHARED FROM THE ADVOCATES THAT THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THOSE OUTREACH FUNDS AREN'T CONDUCIVE TO YOU KNOW PLANNING WITH LOCALS AND THAT THE CONTRACT AWARDS AND SO. OUR HOPE IS THAT NOW THAT THE FUNDING IS ON GOING THAT THERE IS A IS A ESTABLISHED A NETWORK OF THAT OUTREACH AND TAX PREPARATION FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO PROVIDE- INCREASED AWARENESS AND BENEFIT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE FROM FDB HAS ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO ADD UP. AT FRONT AT OXFORD YES SIR. I WAS PROPOSAL SUGGESTING OR ITS WITH ON FOR OF DURING THE COURSE THE STUDY I HOW TO INCREASE THE OF THE I. THAT'S OF THE COPS THAT'S BUT I. YOUR YOUR FUNDING- IS NOT AT THE AS I THINK COULD BE SOME OF OUR GRANTEES IN ORDER TO- RESPECT- FELT WHAT HOPE. ABOUT THE SERVER COOK AT MENTIONED WE DO HAVE A PROPOSED ALERT. I'M NOT SPEAK. HOUSE THIRTY BROUGH UP IN ALASKA SECOND OF YOUR QUOTE YOU'RE A COMMON USE THERE WAS AN OUTCRY FOR FILERS AND NON FILERS AND THEN YOU BROKE UP. YES I AM APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT'S PART OF OUR- AT THE FOURTEEN ONLINE STUDY ARE WE REALLY LOOKED AT. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS THAT. INCREASE THE UPTAKE OF YET YOU SEE AS SOME OF THE LOWEST PAYING FOR THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. IS THAT YES ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE IN HOUSE IN ORDER TO. REACH THE FILERS AND NON FILERS. SO IN LOOKING. AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE FOR FOLKS WHO FILED. BUT DIDN'T- PLAY YEAH I TO SEE WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS WOULD BE- EXCUSE. OUR SUMMER. THE THREE. IN. ORDER I'M ACTUALLY AN LETTING THEM KNOW ABOUT THE PRO AS WELL WIDESPREAD SAYS ADDING. TO APPLY ALSO LOOKING TO DO THE SAME FOR NOT FILERS SO BE LOOKING WITH OUR FILER DAY. TO IDENTIFY TO BE A LARGE BUT THE NOT **** AND ALSO IN THE LET LET THEM ABOUT THE PRO THAT VALUABLE CREDIT THIS. SO CHAIR IF I MAY AS NOTED F. T. B. DATA REESE. TO THE THAT AND HOUSE THAT IS WHAT. SHE WAS JUST A IS THOSE. FOR FILE ENOUGH. IN ADDITION TO THE CAN BASED. GRANTS THE TEN MILLION THIS IS WHAT'S FDB GOING TO BE DOING AND HOUSE TO TRY TO INCREASE- THE ATC PARTICIPATION. AND WHAT ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS LIKE HOW IS THE TRACKING OF SUCCESS INCREASE THE ATC CLAMOR. WHAT WHAT IS AND COLONISTS AND TAX FILERS- I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO BE HAVE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE EXPECTED- INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TAX FILERS. THANK L. FOR THE QUESTION- TAKE LONG ENOUGH TO BE SO WE ARE IN OUR FOLLOW AND UNFOLLOW ALTHOUGH WE ARE ESTIMATING A 5% RESPONSE RATE- THE AVAIL NOTED. THE RESPONSE RATE COULD BE HAS BEEN VERY LOW TRADITIONALLY- HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF FOR EXAMPLE LET'S LOOK AT THAT ON TOP. OF THE- NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND I DON'T OUT BEACH TO. WEAR INTO GETTING ALMOST STRAIGHT UP. HOUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING- I'M HAVING A HARD HEARING YOU LET'S CAN WE TRY MAYBE TAKING OFF THE VIDEO AND JUST HEARING- JUST HEARING YOU THE LAST I HEARD WAS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND NON FILERS. YES THE WE'VE IDENTIFIED NINE HUNDRED- DOT NON FILERS- BUT WE CLING OUTREACH TO- RESPONSE RATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- IT. I ALSO TO CHECK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT HOW ARE WE MEASURING I'M SUCCESS I THINK WE DID DISCUSS THIS LAST TIME- OUR VITAL. IS THAT WE ARE WORKING- AND HAVEN'T SPECIAL PROGRAMS- IN ORDER TO PUT THE METRICS SUCH AS THE PLACE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS- OUR GRANTEES ARE LOOKING AT REALLY. THE POPULATION WAS CARTONING USING OUR BY OUR BUSINESS DAY. FOUR THREE. TO IT NUMBER. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE FOR JUST DOING SOME QUICK MATH 5% OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IT'S FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. BUT WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT THAT'S GONNA WORK OUT MISTER LUCKY TO HAVE A COMMENT YEAH. I HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT- MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS ON THE NEUTRALITY THAT. POSITION THAT YOU SEEM TO TAKE ON THE ASSET RECOVERY- QUESTION THERE'S A BULLET POINT IN HERE THAT SAYS THAT THERE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. BEING REQUESTED ANNUALLY ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FOR THREE POSITIONS DEDICATED TO ASSET RECOVERY PROCESS. SO WHY THE NEUTRAL POSITION. YEAH I THINK I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IF ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER WAS REFERRING TO SPECIFIC- THAT LEGISLATION- AND MAYBE JUST NOT MY FAMILIARITY WITH- THOSE THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S NANCY FROM IT FROM EDT YEAH AS I AS I MENTIONED I MEAN WE ARE 1100% DEDICATED TO ASSET RECOVERY- THERE'S ALREADY RESTITUTION WHEN SOMEONE IS PROSECUTED. YOU KNOW AND WE ARE WE WOULDN'T GO AFTER ASSETS- WHEN WE FELT WHEN THEY ARE FOUND- SO IF I DON'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE ARE WE ARE WE CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ON THE LEGISLATION BUT GENERALLY. CORRECT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR B. C. P. AND THAT IS FOR ASSET RECOVERY AND WE PLAN ON GOING AFTER MIGHT THE PREVIOUS DOCTOR SAID AND I WILL SAY IT WE PLAN ON GOING AFTER EVERY DIME THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY GET IT NO MATTER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. IT'S MORE COURAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY YES AND CHAIR I BELIEVE. MY COLLEAGUE FROM- KELLY C. H. IS BACK ONLINE TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. ON YOUR COMMON SENSE. ON YOUTH. YES SEVENTH ST THAT THE SET ASIDE IF THERE'S ANY IN. ANY CLOSELY FOR VICTOR. THANKS SO MUCH AND- WEBER LET ME TRY. JUST WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. SO VICTOR I BELIEVE THE WAS- IF I MAJOR I BELIEVE THE QUESTION WAS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE AND CAN'T MAKE GRANTS IF THERE'S ANYTHING- EARMARKED OR SET ASIDE FOR TO ADDRESS YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND MY AND MY RESPONSE WAS I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING SPECIFIC BUT IF MAYBE YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE A CAP MEANT- PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN TARGETED TOWARDS YOU. THAT'S WHERE THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE ENCAMPMENTS BETTING ENCAMPMENTS YES THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY SO- HE HAS CURRENTLY AS CURRENTLY DESIGNED THE NEXT GENERATION OF INCOME AND RESOLUTION GRANT WOULDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC SET ASIDE FOR YOU- HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN OUR PROPOSALS. IN BOTH THE FIRST ITERATION AND THIS NEXT ITERATION WILL BE UP- PROPOSALS THAT LOOK AT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED I'M OF COURSE USE BEING ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES I'M AND OTHER COMPONENTS AROUND EQUITY AS WELL- ALTHOUGH I WOULD ALSO SHARE THAT ALL OF OUR- FLEXIBLE HABIT YOUTHS ASIDE AND THAT WOULD SET ASIDE HAS BEEN INCREASING WITH EACH GENERATION- IN FACT THE LATEST ROUNDS OF CAP REQUIRED THAT TEN PERCENT. OF THE BLOCK GRANTS E UTILIZED SPECIFICALLY FOR SERVICES. FOR YOUTH AND I JUST- BECAUSE THAT INCIDENTALLY SIR IF YOU BUT THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEEDS OF USE AND SO AS WE LOOK AT HALF THREE AND A HALF FOR AND THE LOCAL ACTION PLANNING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IS HOW ARE THEY LEVERAGING OTHER PROGRAMS THAT COME ONLINE- IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE LOCAL ACTION PLANS FOR HAPPENED THAT'LL OF COURSE INCLUDE HOW ARE THEY LEVERAGING THE ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION GRANT AND WILL THERE BE ANY SYNERGY THERE BETWEEN. THE US SATISFIED INDIAN CAPTAIN RESOURCES. ARE GOING TO BE COMING ONLINE. THANK YOU FOR THE- FOR THE RESPONSE. WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH- HOMELESS YOUTH. WHO LIVE IN ENCAMPMENTS. AS WELL AS FOSTER YOU WHO FIND THEMSELVES LIKE IN THIS LIMBO SPACE OF TRYING TO. YOU KNOW. FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR LIVES GOING. LIFE GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN END UP OFTEN TIMES- FUND HOUSE. SO I. I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW. WHY ONLY. WHY IS THE FOCUS ONLY ON HALF FUNDING AND POTENTIALLY NOT HAVING FUNDING FOR THAT NEXT YEAR. I WANT TO GET MYSELF CONFUSED WITH ALL THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE. CURRENTLY LOOKING AT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT YOUTH HOUSING- AND YOUTH ENCAMPMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. NO ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT LIKE I SAID WE'VE BEEN REQUIRED A YOUTH SET ASIDE ALL OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS- AND IN FACT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE EFFICACY OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THAT SET ASIDE AS WELL MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- THE CALVET INITIATIVE AND THE- I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION BUT- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY IF I'M LOOKING THIS CORRECTLY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF A ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WILL BE GOING TO THIS INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE AWARENESS WHICH IS CLEARLY. AN IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS HOWEVER- HOW TO RURAL AREAS COMPETE FOR THESE FUNDS AND HOW WILL WE BE ASSURED THAT THEY ARE JUST- CLUSTERED IN URBAN REGIONS. TIM WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I BELIEVE WE SOME FROM CAVAN WHEN THEY CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK UP CALIFORNIA BETTER HEALTH INITIATIVE. OF THE GRANTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED STRATEGICALLY- FOCUSING ON THEM HE BOTH INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE. WE WILL TARGET DIVERSE BETTER POPULATIONS. GEOGRAPHICALLY BOTH IN RURALAND URBAN SETTINGS AS WELL AS VETERANS OF ALL AGES SERVICE TYPE OF SERVICE DISCHARGED STATUS DISABILITY RATING AND SO ON. SO AS YOU KNOW- RURAL AREAS TEND TO HAVE A HARDER TIME THAT COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM CARE IS GENERALLY NOT IS STRONG IN THOSE AREAS SO TO STAND UP PROGRAMS IT OFTEN. TAKES A LOT MORE EFFORT ON CAL THAT'S PART AS WELL AS WORKING CLASS VERY CLOSE TO THAT COMMITTEE BASSIST MARK KERR WE SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE STRUCTURED IN THE VETERAN HOUSING THE HOMELESS PREVENTION PROGRAM. TO GET DEVELOPMENTS FOR THAT PROGRAM INTO RURAL AREAS THERE'S A LOT OF LEG WORK ON OUR END IN- ACTING THAT LOCAL. MANY BASIS TO OF CARE. AND HELPING THEM. STAND UP THE STRUCTURE IDENTIFY THEIR PARTNERS IN BUILDING NINETEEN WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY TO. TO PROVIDE SUCH EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY WITH THIS PROGRAM THE IDEA OF IT ALSO. IS TO FOR THOSE AGENCIES WITHIN. EIGHT MORE OWNERS LIKE SAN DIEGO FOR INSTANCE TO REACH OUT TO IMPERIAL COUNTY OR OR FOLKS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA TO REACH OUT FURTHER UP NORTH THERE IS ADDITIONAL EFFORT WILL BE ADDITIONAL EFFORT UNDER WAY TO COORDINATE AND CONNECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER. ON INFILL MORMON NETWORK OF CARE ADDITIONALLY WILL BE PROPOSED THE BE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE FUNDING THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR TELE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL. ALSO ASSIST IN FILLING SOME OF THAT GAP THAT- COULD BE AN OBVIOUSLY FROM A MORE URBAN SETTING. OKAY MY FEAR IS THAT- THE DIFFICULT THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED. AWFULLY EQUATES TO DENIAL. AND THAT'S WHAT I STILL FAIR AND I HOPE THAT- MY FEARS ARE. NOT JUSTIFIED AND THAT YOU ACTUALLY WILL MAKE AN EQUITABLE OUT REACH. TO THESE I KNOW IT'S MORE DIFFICULT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE DESERVING OF THEIR- OF THEIR SUPPORT IT'S NOT FAIR. FOR THEM TO BE DENIED JUST BECAUSE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS SO I'M HOPING THAT- YOU GUYS WILL TAKE US A- THIS REQUEST- SINCERELY THANK YOU. YES SIR AND THAT AND THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT AS WELL AND THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS MUCH OF WHETHER BECAUSE SUPPORT ARE ANY VETERAN SERVICE OFFICERS WHO ARE SUBVENTION FUNDING IN THAT PARTNERSHIP- WE ALWAYS DEVELOP A WAY TO- SHOULD SHARE THAT NEED IS ALSO ADDRESSED IN THOSE MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE WILL SOON BE GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT- MY LAST SET OF QUESTIONS- BEFORE WE DO THAT OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO I JUST. SHERA A FEW QUESTIONS CAN THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM PROPOSED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ONE. WHAT TYPES OF APPRENTICESHIPS WILL BE SUPPORTED TO. POWER THE DEPARTMENT ENSURE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES CAN LEARN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM THREE QUESTIONS. GREAT RISK UP FRONT PART IN FINANCE AND I DON'T. OKAY MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEPARTMENT OF GENERALIZATIONS WILL JUMP ON IN THE SECTOR EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF BUT- AS SHE'S PREPARING I WOULD JUST SAY THEIR PARTNERSHIPS- IS. PROPOSING THAT PRINTER PROPOSALS IS- IT TO EXPAND NONTRADITIONAL PRINCES IN AREAS SUCH AS LIKE FARM AND RANCH COMPUTER SCIENCE SOFTWARE IT COMPUTER SUPPORT AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING AND HEALTH CARE. AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM DR WILL EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE BROADER APPROACH FOR THAT- THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON FOLKS AND THIS IS A DAHLE BURNS AND I AM THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND- I'M HAPPY TO. ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS HERE SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT ABOUT FRIENDSHIP INNOVATION FUNDING. WAS MENTIONED BY CHRIS THAT BETTER IDEA HERE IS TO BE EXPANDING. NEW ALKA APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO SCALE TO SERVE MORE EMPLOYERS AND MORE APPRENTICES AND ULTIMATELY. TO ADVANCE MORE QUICKLY TOWARDS THE GOAL OF SERVING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPRENTICES BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE. SO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LAUNCH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. IT REALLY IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE A CONVENING FORCE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS NEEDED TO CREATE A PROGRAM. INCLUDING EMPLOYERS EDUCATORS OF COURSE APPRENTICES- AND SOMETIMES ALSO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS OR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE REALLY NEED THAT CONVENING FORCE TO BRING THOSE PARTNERS TOGETHER TO DESIGN REGISTER. AND LAUNCH A PROGRAM SO THE TRADITIONAL APPRENTICESHIPS SCIENCE IN THE C. A. C. FIVE IN THE BUILDING AND THE FIRE TRADES. OFTEN THIS CONVENING ROLE IS PLAYED BY A UNION. BUT AS WE LOOK TO TRY TO EXPAND APPRENTICESHIPS TO LOTS OF DIFFERENT SECTORS. WHO PLAYS THIS CONVENING ROLE CAN LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS WE CALL THIS CONVENING ROLE AN APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARY. AND REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING WITH THE SUBCONSCIOUS IN ADDITION. FUNDING IS TO BE. OR TOWARDS THE SYSTEM. AGREES FOR THESE PRINTER SHOULD TO MEET AND ALL WE WANT TO BE. A WHOLE. OF THESE APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARIES SO TO YOUR QUESTION- I DON'T YOU KNOW WHO ARE THE POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM- AS YOU KNOW AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT I ACCURATE APPRENTICESHIPS WHAT THAT MEANS IS. APPRENTICESHIPS IN ALL SECTORS THAT ARE NOT THE BUILDING PRIOR TRADES SO THAT INCLUDES HEALTH CARE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION TAX CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PUBLIC SECTOR TRANSPORTATION. I COULD GO ON BUT BASICALLY EVERY SECTOR THAT'S NOT THE BUILDING AND FIRE TRAINS- AND SO THIS. INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO REALLY CULTIVATE MORE PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO SCALE MORE- SERVE MORE APPRENTICES IN SECTORS SUCH AS TO GIVE YOU A FEW. CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF WHO COULD BE POTENTIAL RECIPIENTS OF THE FUND CALLED THE LAUNCH APPRENTICESHIP NETWORK WHICH IS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A REGIONAL APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARY SO THEY HAVE THEY ALREADY HAVE OCCUPATIONS REGISTERED IN AUTOMOTIVE HEALTH CARE T. MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SO THEY ARE A REGIONAL INTERMEDIARY THAT'S SERVING MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS. I'M A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXAMPLE IS WE HAVE A PROGRAM WITH THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND. AND BAND HAVE CREATED A PATHWAY FOR LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES TO BECOME REGISTERED NURSES AND THIS PROGRAM IS PHENOMENAL IT HAS 75% WOMEN 80% OF MINORITIES AND- THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THEY MORE THAN DOUBLED THEIR WAGES THEY GO FOR MAKING FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO THIS IS. JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE ABLE. TO SCALE- WITH THIS FUNDING SOME OTHER EXAM. IS- WHY IN THIS HOW WHICH IS OUT OF. HAS AND- DEVELOP UPON PRO. SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SCHOOL APPRENTICESHIPS IS ANOTHER PROGRAM WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT SPECIALIST. AND THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY STARTS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I'M NOT CERTAIN EXAMPLE ABOUT- AN EARLY MOVER IN TERMS OF HIGH SCHOOL AND YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP- AND THEN I'VE ALSO MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA FARM ACADEMY APPRENTICESHIPS THAT'S BEGINNING FARM AND RANCH MANAGERS SO. THIS IS JUST THAT A SET OF EXAMPLES TO OFFER YOU THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ALREADY TODAY IN THIS AYE ACCESS SPACE OF APPRENTICESHIP- BUT THAT. THE MEAN NUMBER OF APPRENTICES IS TWELVE SO WHAT THAT SHOULD TELL YOU IS THAT WE HAVE PROOF OF CONCEPT BUT THERE'S REALLY A NEED TO SCALE AND AS WE'VE TALKED TO THESE PROGRAMS THEY REALLY IDENTIFIED. FUNDING FOR THE ON GOING RUNNING AND SOMETIMES THE TRAINING COSTS IN ORDER TO SERVE MORE PARTICIPANTS. SO THIS FUNDING AIMS TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TO SCALING AND THEN- FINALLY TO YOUR QUESTION AND HOWEVER WE MAKING SURE THAT WERE MAKING USE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO. UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS AND THOSE THAT HAVE FACED BARRIERS. TO EMPLOYMENT- AS WE TO APPRENTICESHIP AND NO. IT'S IN OUR AND LEARN TALK. SO% BY. THIS EARLY LEARN TO. INTO A OF DIFFERENT CAREERS AND ARE TRYING. WORKFRONT CREATE A MORE ACT AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. ON RAMP INTO A CAREER THAT'S THAT'S MORE ACCESSIBLE TO WOMEN MINORITIES JUSTICE INVOLVED. ALMOST FASTER YOUTH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND REALLY OTHERS THAT FACE DEGREE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND I WILL SAY. PERSONALLY THIS IS WHY I DO THIS WORK IS BECAUSE I'M REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT CREATING IS ON RAMPS INTO LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY. I'M AND INCLUDED IN THIS YEAH- FUNDING THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IF THE WHOLE COMPONENT AROUND OUTREACH AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THESE PATHWAYS AVAILABLE. TO THE FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED THEM THE MOST AND- JUST I WILL SAY THAT SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE WERE ALREADY DOING THIS- WE ARE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BE ABILITY SHIN TO ELEVATE DIFFERENT APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY'RE SERVING- ANOTHER WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. THESE PATHWAYS MORE VISIBLE AND AVAILABLE IS BY PARTNERING WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD SO. HERE YOU GO DIAZ RECEIVED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR DEAL WHILE GRANTS FOR EXPANDING EQUITABLE APPRENTICESHIPS. WE HAVE TURNED AROUND AND DONE A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. INVITED COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN WORKFORCE BOARDS AND THESE APPRENTICESHIP INTERMEDIARIES AND WE JUST ANNOUNCED THE RECIPIENTS OF THOSE FRANCE ON MAY FOURTH AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING ON THOSE COLLABORATIONS. SO THAT REALLY ADDS WE'RE SCALING THESE IRAQ APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO THOSE. WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED. MUCH OF. THE DETAIL RESPONSE AND I CAN I CAN TELL THAT YOU ARE. INCREDIBLY ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU DO SO THANK YOU FOR THAT MUCH NEEDED THEY MENTIONED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW APPRENTICES BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE THAT'S SEVEN YEARS THAT'S ON AVERAGE. SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT NEW APPRENTICES EVERY YEAR TO MEET THAT GOAL YOU THINK THAT'S FEASIBLE. PRESIDENT SO WE CERTAINLY DID A LOT OF- FORECASTING AND MODELING TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT WHAT WAS I REQUEST FOR FUNDING THIS PARTICULAR FUNDING REQUEST IS FOR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE SPENT OVER THREE YEARS AND TWO YEARS IS NOT SEVEN YEARS RIGHT. MMHM SO THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO BE DEMONSTRATING HOW THIS NEW FUNDING MECHANISM WILL INDEED HELP SCALE I AKA APPRENTICESHIPS- SO RIGHT NOW THERE'S ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND I ACT APPRENTICESHIPS AND WE WANT TO BE DOUBLING NOT ROUGHLY BY MAKING THIS INVESTMENTS OVER THE COMING THREE YEARS- THAT WOULD GET US ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY TOWARD SERVING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND APPRENTICES BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE- BUT WE WANT TO START WITH THIS INVESTMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE A BRIDGE OF FUNDING. THAT REALLY BROKE INTO THE KIND OF SCALING UP IRAQ APPRENTICESHIPS THAT THAT WE WANT. TO BE MAKING AN- THANK YOU AND JUST. UP TO US I NEED SOME. WIRED THE- WHERE BUILDING TRADE APPRENTICESHIPS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL. GREAT QUESTION SO ACTUALLY IN- IN THE MAY REVISED THERE ARE TWO INVESTMENTS IN APPRENTICESHIP GENERALLY ONE IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN SCALING I ACT THAT APPRENTICESHIPS- BUT THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE RELATED AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION FUNDING WHICH IS TOP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING- AND THIS IS UTILIZED HEAVILY BY THE C. A. C. PROGRAMS TO COVER THE TRAINING COSTS. AND HISTORICALLY THAT HAVE BEEN BENCHMARKS TO THE NOT FOR CREDIT EDUCATION RATES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND- IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS BEING PROPOSED TO BRING THAT UP TO THE FOR CREDIT RATING AND REALLY IT'S DEMONSTRATING HOW MUCH WE VALUE APPRENTICESHIP EDUCATION AND- WE REALLY WANT TO BE CULTIVATING THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF APPRENTICESHIP AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WITH THIS OMBINED INVESTMENT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. THAT WILL BE- LIFTING THE TITLE BUT IT'S RIGHT THAT REALLY INVESTING BOTH AND- WELL ESTABLISHED CA SEE PROGRAMS AND ALSO SPARKING A WHOLE LOT BROKE THE INDIA. AFTER PROGRAMS AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR ME- FOR WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THE MAY REVISE INCLUDES TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOR THE BUREAU OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OVER THREE YEARS TO SHORE UP THE BUREAU'S FUNK- CONDITION. WHAT IS THE PLAN TO CHANGE THE BUREAU FEE STRUCTURE AND ARE THREE YARS NEEDED TO REVISE THE FEES. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. REPORTER PUT SECONDARY EDUCATION PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF HAVE A CONFECTIONERY EDUCATION INSTITUTION. WHAT IS THE NOBLE INDUSTRY- WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THE AND THE COMING HERE IT IS THINKING THANK YOU STUDY AND A NEW APPROACH TO FIGURING OUT HOW TO BEST FUNDING HE WILL REGULATORY AGENCY. OR A PRIVATE UNDENIABLE INTENSE AND THEN. SORRY WE'RE A HARD HEARING YOU- MAYBE IF WE TURNED OFF YOUR MICROPHONE I'M SORRY YOUR VIDEO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. STOP WHAT MICROPHONE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER THAT'S MORE HELPFUL. JUST KEEP GOING THEN WE'LL SEE. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN THE COMING YEARS IT IS- IT'S AFFECT THE BROADER RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE STRONG ABLE OVERSIGHT. EVEN IN INDUSTRY THAT FLUCTUATES OVER TIME AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR EDUCATION AND STRAIGHT FROM TO DO. SO I'M IN TERMS THAT WE BELIEVE A THREE YEAR TIMELINE FOR THE GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORTING THE GOAL OF ENSURING STRONG STABLE OVERSIGHT OF THE INDUSTRY. THE HIGH LEVEL TIMELINE TO EXPLAIN WHY IS FIRST TO BE GROWTH SLATED TO GO TO YOUR SUNSET REVIEW IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THIS YEAR. WE EXPECT AT THAT PROCESS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CURRENT CHARGER JURISDICTION. IN THE CHANGES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REFLECTED IN NEW FUNDING APPROACH. SO THIS TWENTY TWO TWO. AND THEN THE CHANGES LAW BE OFFERED AT THE START TWENTY TWENTY THREE. EARLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE BUREAU BEGIN AND- CHANGES STEMMING FROM SENATE THAT REVIEW PROCESS. AND WE WOULD ALSO ENGAGE EXPERTS TO DO THAT BROADER ANALYSIS APPROACHES. WE ESTIMATE THAT PROCESS WOULD CONCLUDE IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY THREE BY EARLY TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE BUREAU WOULD HAVE A NEW FUNDING PROPOSAL TO SHARE WITH LEGISLATORS TO TURN STAKEHOLDERS YOU MAY BE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND INTO LAW INVOLVED FALSE TWENTY FOUR EXACTLY GOING BACK TO TWENTY FIVE THAT IS REALLY WHY WE BELIEVE THREE YEARS NECESSARY TIME YOU THE GOAL AT A ABLE REGULATORS THE FACE. THANK YOU MUCH. THAT AND IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- I WANT TO THANK. ALL OF YOU THAT PARTICIPATED IN- TODAY'S HEARING. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PERMANENT FINANCING ONLY- AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET SOUTH. WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS.

PASSED WRECKED ALLOCATIONS AND HOPEFULLY FUTURE. IS PUT TO THE BEST USE POSSIBLE TO HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE ONGOING FLEXIBLE HOMELESS FUNDING CALLED HAP- IN OUR TOP BUDGET PRIORITY REMAINS A THREE YEAR. ALLOCATION THREE BILLION FOR THREE YEARS FOR HALF. A TO THE BIG TO THE THIRTEEN CITIES. THESE FLEXIBLE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS HAVE ALLOWED OUR CITIES TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL NINE THOUSAND SHELTER SPACES. AND SERVE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. THESE CITIES WE RELY ON THESE FUNDS OPERATE THOUSANDS OF INTERVENTION SUCH AS- COMMUNITY CABINS SAFE RV PARKING TINY HOME VILLAGES. AT TA WHY SHELTERS OUTREACH IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THE LIST GOES ON FOR ALL THIRTEEN CITIES WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS IN VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. OBVIOUSLY OUR FEAR AND OUR CONCERN IS WITHOUT HALF FUNDING THEN WE HAVE TO DEMOBILIZE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY OUR MOST- IN JEOPARDIZE THAT RESIDENTS WOULD BE HITTING THE STREETS HEADING BUT THE STREETS AGAIN SO.

AND IT'S UNCALLED FOR THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE WHO HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO SAFE PLACE TO GO. IN AN EVER COMMUNITIES. GRANTED WITH THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE LGBT Q. AND YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR.

AND SO WE SUPPORT YOU IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IT IS CRITICAL. FOR THE OVERALL HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM TO SURE THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY PREVENT IT. BUT THAT WE ALSO HAVE. A ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR THEM. AND THAT ARE CBO TO DO THIS WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT WHO ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING THE OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS CAN APPLY FOR THE FUNDS DIRECTLY.

THEY'RE PROTECTED AND THAT THEY- FIND A HOME THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MARKS DIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND- I JUST WANT TO SECOND THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAKES EARLIER THAT WAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR GREATER INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WE FACE AN UNPRECEDENTED SORT HOUSING CRISIS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE ARE REALLY TWO PROGRAMS ONE IS THE VERY SUCCESSFUL HOUSING ACCELERATOR THAT THE STATE CREATED LAST YEAR- IT ALLOWS PROJECTS THAT ARE STUCK IN THE QUEUE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TO ACTUALLY MOVE TO CONSTRUCTION WE ARE HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED WE'VE MAXED OUT OUR FEDERAL RESOURCES AND THE STATE CAME IN AND MADE THOSE PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD- WE NEED. THAT WOULD LIKE THAT THAT PROGRAM NEEDS TO CONTINUE AND THEN THE SECOND IS THE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND THIS IS HOW WE GET THE NEXT GENERATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS STARTED THEY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE AT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE LAST AWARD UNDER THAT PROGRAM BY NEXT YEAR THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT LEFT NEXT YEAR THE BOND FUNDS ARE PRETTY MUCH GONE SO- WITH NO SORT OF LONG TERM FUNDING AND- IT. COMING FOR THAT PROGRAM WE ESSENTIALLY ARE STOPPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION GOING FORWARD SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE DESPERATELY ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AS IT AS IT LOOKS TO THE MAY REVISE INTO THE FINAL BUDGET.
