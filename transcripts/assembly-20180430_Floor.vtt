01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:12.829 region:rollup2
.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.964 region:rollup2

GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:20.604 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT LAW

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:22.105 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SUPPORTS IT AND MOST

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:24.741 region:rollup2

THAT TIME YOU KNOW I FIND IT

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2

THIS FLOOR WE REGULATELAW

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:37.254 region:rollup2
ABIDING CITIZENS THIS BILL IS

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:39.189 region:rollup2

GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THAT'S

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:53.436 region:rollup2
THE FRUSTRATING PART OF YESES

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.171 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:57.140 region:rollup2
MEETS THE LAW AND THEIR

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:58.274 region:rollup2
QUIETNESS OF LAWS IS TO SEE

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.776 region:rollup2
FOLKS BE ABLE TO.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:01.811 region:rollup2

HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:36.012 region:rollup2
RECEIVED W. HOLDERS I THINK IT

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.647 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:39.382 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.718 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS I'VE HEARD OF HEARING

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.253 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO IT'S NOT CHANGED

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.721 region:rollup2
SOMETHING A FORMULA THAT IS

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:46.122 region:rollup2
WORKING EXTREMELY WELL.

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:47.657 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:48.558 region:rollup2

WE HAVE SOME MEMBERS WHO SEEM TO

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.931 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH ME THAT THE SYSTEM IS

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:55.665 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:57.567 region:rollup2
.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:59.135 region:rollup2

MEMBERS OF ALREADY SPOKEN HAVE

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:02.038 region:rollup2
BROUGHT ISSUES WITH THIS BILL.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.605 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.341 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING THAT MILITARY

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:07.310 region:rollup2
MEMBERS MAY HAVE HAD.

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:08.578 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT.

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.213 region:rollup2
COUNTY SHERIFFS ARE REALLY

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:11.314 region:rollup2
ALREADY IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:13.283 region:rollup2
OF REQUIREMENTS.

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:14.617 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:17.287 region:rollup2
I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:18.188 region:rollup2
POINT OF THIS BILL BRINKLEY.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:18.888 region:rollup2
DON'T FIX SOMETHING THAT ISN'T

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.757 region:rollup2
BROKEN.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
THESE REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:24.394 region:rollup2
PLACE AND I.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:26.529 region:rollup2
I MYSELF DON'T KNOW OF ANY

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:28.598 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH CCW

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:30.033 region:rollup2
HOLDERS IN THE STATE I KNOW WHAT

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.667 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD WITH

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.469 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T SUPPOSED TO

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:35.238 region:rollup2
HAVE GUNS. LIKE THOSE THAT ARE

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:36.673 region:rollup2
ON ON THE APPS DATABASE I KNOW

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:38.174 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PROBLEMS OF THEM BOYS

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:39.442 region:rollup2
CCW HOLDERS.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:44.280 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AWARE OF THEM SO I WOULD

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:45.515 region:rollup2
URGE NO VOTE.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.716 region:rollup2
MISTER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED

SPEAKER AND MEMBERS.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.154 region:rollup2
ONE THINGS I THINK IT'S

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.622 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT RECOGNIZES THAT WE

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:54.591 region:rollup2
FIND OURSELVES IN THE BLIND.

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:56.159 region:rollup2
OF THIS CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:58.628 region:rollup2
ISSUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF

01:04:56.159 --> 01:05:00.530 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:01.631 region:rollup2
TO BAN OPEN CARRY.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.399 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:05.201 region:rollup2
ABOUT PERSONS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:07.337 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO CARRY A FIREARM IF

YOU BANNED OPEN CARRY.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:10.073 region:rollup2
AND YOU TRY TO MAKE IT AS

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:11.941 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:13.943 region:rollup2
CONCEALED WEAPON. THEN YOU'RE

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.612 region:rollup2
PUTTING PEOPLE IN AN INABILITY

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:18.148 region:rollup2
BE ABLE EXERCISE THEIR OWN

01:05:15.612 --> 01:05:19.048 region:rollup2
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
ONE OF THINGS THAT I DO QUESTION

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:23.286 region:rollup2
HERE IS WATER THE COSTS

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE BURDEN TO

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:26.923 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A PROGRAM

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.691 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS. IN OUR WE INDEED

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:30.226 region:rollup2
SETTING UP A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.195 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:35.331 region:rollup2
MONEY A CERTAIN. AMOUNT OF

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:37.300 region:rollup2
WEALTH JUST TO SIMPLY EXERCISE

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:39.536 region:rollup2
THEIR RIGHT TO BEAR A FIREARM.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.805 region:rollup2
MISTER SPEAKER A.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:46.743 region:rollup2
I ASK THIS QUESTION AND I URGE A

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:48.678 region:rollup2
NO VOTE ON THIS BILL.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:50.046 region:rollup2
SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:52.182 region:rollup2
OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM BEFORE THE

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:53.583 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:54.851 region:rollup2
MISTER GLORIA YOU MAY CLOSE

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:55.952 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:58.021 region:rollup2
TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:59.355 region:rollup2
ROBUST DEBATE ON THIS IMPORTANT

01:05:58.021 --> 01:06:00.890 region:rollup2
PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.858 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO BE RESPONSIVE

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.892 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THIS IS THE

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:05.094 region:rollup2
MID POINT IN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:06.729 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF BUT WE CAN HAVE

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.530 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL AS THEY

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:10.166 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUR MILITARY VETERANS I

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:12.135 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE TAKEN AT LEAST TWO

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.735 region:rollup2
VOTES. LIKE THAT ALREADY THE

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.670 region:rollup2
SESSION WE COULD PROBABLY DO

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.838 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.472 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU'RE

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.940 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.707 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL GUN SAFETY

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.875 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.976 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA OF

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:21.044 region:rollup2
INVESTED THAT ABILITY IN EVERY

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.878 region:rollup2
SINGLE ONE OF US AND YOU CAN

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.546 region:rollup2
INTRODUCE A BILL IF YOU WANT TO

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.547 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT ON.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.715 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WANT TO ADDRESS

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.583 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE HEARD

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:28.384 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.819 region:rollup2
PROCESS BY SOME WHO WOULD LIKE

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:31.654 region:rollup2
TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.089 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.924 region:rollup2
AND I REJECT THAT ARGUMENT

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:36.526 region:rollup2
FORCEFULLY.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:38.161 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.762 region:rollup2
REALLY ASK WHY CAN'T WE HOW WHY

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:41.564 region:rollup2
DO WE WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
TRAGEDY OF SOME KIND FOR US TO

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.766 region:rollup2
PUT FORWARD A PIECE OF

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.468 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT IS REALLY WHAT

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:47.136 region:rollup2
THAT ARGUMENT IS. AND I DON'T

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:49.138 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT ANY OF US WANT TO SEE

01:06:47.136 --> 01:06:50.506 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TRAGEDY WE CAN TAKE

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:52.609 region:rollup2
ACTION TODAY NOT TO PENALIZE LAW

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:53.710 region:rollup2
ABIDING. GUN OWNERS BUT TO

01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:55.678 region:rollup2
SIMPLY TO ASK THEM TO PROVE

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.480 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY THE ABILITY TO%

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:59.282 region:rollup2
UTILIZE AND STORE THEIR GUN

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.883 region:rollup2
SAFELY.

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:01.451 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:03.653 region:rollup2
WRONG WITH THAT THERE IS A

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:04.721 region:rollup2
MINIMUM STANDARD OF FOR FOLKS TO

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:05.722 region:rollup2
FOLLOW ON AND I DON'T SEE THAT

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:06.990 region:rollup2
AS BURDENSOME.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THE SHERIFF'S DON'T

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.693 region:rollup2
SEE THAT AS BURDENSOME WHAT THIS

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:12.262 region:rollup2
DOES IS STANDARDIZED ACROSS THIS

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:13.663 region:rollup2
GREAT STATE OF OURS WELL WITH

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:15.465 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM STANDARDS BEFORE HE

01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:17.800 region:rollup2
PERMITTED TO WALK AROUND IN

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:19.269 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WITH A LOADED GUN.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.870 region:rollup2
AND SO. I THINK THIS IS WHERE

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:22.972 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION IT'S COMMONSENSE

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.407 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:26.543 region:rollup2
ALL OF YOUR OFFICES WERE VISITED

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:27.610 region:rollup2
BY CITIZEN VOLUNTEERS OFTEN MANY

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:29.045 region:rollup2
OF THEM IN RED SHIRTS MANY OF

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:00.803 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS BOUNTY HUNTERS.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.504 region:rollup2
THIS PRACTICE THEIR GRADES THE

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:03.439 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF OUR DIRECT

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:04.840 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY AND THIS STEP PROCESS

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:07.209 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BEHAVIOR IS BASED ON

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.844 region:rollup2
THE BOUNTY HUNTERS BOTTOM LINE

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:10.246 region:rollup2
AND NOT THE POLICY.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.580 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HELPS MAINTAIN THAT

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:13.182 region:rollup2
TAKE B. OF THE INITIATIVE

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.551 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND STILL ALLOWS FOR

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:17.186 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS TO BE PAID. HOURLY

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:19.455 region:rollup2
OF OR BY STIPEND I RESPECTFULLY

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:20.323 region:rollup2
ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.724 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER LOWE MISTER

VERY MUCH I MISTER SPEAKER AND

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.295 region:rollup2
MEMBERS. AYE THIS BILL IN MY

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:28.297 region:rollup2
OPINION IS A SALT ON THE

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:29.231 region:rollup2
GRASSROOTS PROCESS OF COLLECTING

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup2
BALLOT ISSUES HERE IN THE STATE

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:32.034 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.002 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:35.237 region:rollup2
NONPARTISAN CENTER FOR

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:37.106 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES NO I

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:38.674 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INITIATIVES IS WIDELY

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:40.409 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVELY ON VOLUNTEER SINCE

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:43.145 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND VERY

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:44.246 region:rollup2
FEW HAVE USED VOLUNTEERS AT ALL

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.681 region:rollup2
IT INDICATES THAT THERE'S A

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:47.183 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY IN ORGANIZING TO

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:48.517 region:rollup2
STATING A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT

01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:50.286 region:rollup2
CAPABLE OF COLLECTING SEVERAL

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:51.120 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND SIGNATURES.

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:52.822 region:rollup2
I WOULD ARGUE THAT INSTEAD

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.156 region:rollup2
EIGHTY.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:55.624 region:rollup2
EXTENSION OF THE PERIOD OF BE

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:58.060 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GATHER SIGNATURES TO A

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:59.829 region:rollup2
FULL YEAR WOULD ACTUALLY.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.930 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISH WHAT THE AUTHOR IS

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.065 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SEE.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:04.400 region:rollup2
WHICH IS RELYING LESS ON THE

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:06.202 region:rollup2
PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS MOURN

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.737 region:rollup2
GRASSROOTS ACTIVITY AND MORE ON

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:09.538 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:11.474 region:rollup2
I WE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:12.942 region:rollup2
OUR BALLOT INITIATIVES A WHERE

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:14.577 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ONLY BEING I HEARD

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:16.479 region:rollup2
DURING GENERAL ELECTIONS EVERY

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:18.080 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AND INSTEAD EXTENDING

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.714 region:rollup2
THE TIME WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.950 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:22.485 region:rollup2
ON THIS I BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:24.186 region:rollup2
WOULD LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S.

01:15:22.485 --> 01:15:25.788 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THE BALLOT

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.322 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE PROCESS AND I

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.523 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE

01:15:26.322 --> 01:15:29.658 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:31.260 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INTERESTED OFTEN IN

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.995 region:rollup2
PROTECTING ITS OWN TURF UP

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.664 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BALLOT ISSUE PROCESS

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:36.732 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED FOR THE VOTERS ARE

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.501 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GO AROUND THE

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:40.703 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE BUT

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:42.071 region:rollup2
INSTEAD. WE SHOULD GRANT THAT

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:43.739 region:rollup2
OUT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:45.408 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY OF THE VOTERS ON THIS

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:47.076 region:rollup2
ISSUE. OF THIS IS GOING TO

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:49.345 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE COST FOR INITIATIVE

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:50.880 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS ARE TRYING TO USE

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:53.716 region:rollup2
US SOME SORT OF SALARY.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.152 region:rollup2
OR WAGE I EFFORT I IS GOING TO

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:57.319 region:rollup2
BE MORE COSTLY INSTEAD OF.

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:59.588 region:rollup2
THE PERCH SIGNATURE.

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:01.157 region:rollup2
EFFORT OUT WHICH PAYS FOLKS FOR

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:02.858 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL PREDICT PRODUCTIVITY

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:04.427 region:rollup2
THAT THE INDEED GIVE AYE TO THE

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.861 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN TO QUALIFY SPOT

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:06.962 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:08.230 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:11.434 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR HAS PREVIOUSLY

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:13.135 region:rollup2
VETOED SIMILAR LEGISLATION S. B.

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.603 region:rollup2
C. ONE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WAS

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:16.572 region:rollup2
CARRIED BY CORPORATE NOT.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:18.174 region:rollup2
TWENTY ELEVENI WOULD HAVE DONE

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.942 region:rollup2
A VERY SIMILAR THING IN IT WAS

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:21.177 region:rollup2
VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. I

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:23.012 region:rollup2
THINK PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:24.280 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S EVEN REALIZE THAT

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:25.548 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO SQUELCH THE

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.416 region:rollup2
POWER OF THEIR OWN IN FUTURE

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:29.285 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:31.187 region:rollup2
BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. IS

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:32.955 region:rollup2
AGAIN AWAY TO GO AROUND THE

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:35.057 region:rollup2
STATE LEGISLATURE AND GO

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:35.858 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS SOMETHING

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.793 region:rollup2
THAT I'M SURE THAT EVERY

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:39.528 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR WOULD ACTUALLY WANT TO

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:40.529 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO KEEP. AND I ALSO

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:42.798 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:44.667 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:46.302 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CARTS OF NOTED AYE

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:47.770 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE THAT THESE ARE

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:49.905 region:rollup2
AMONG THE MOST PRECIOUS RIGHTS

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.773 region:rollup2
OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IT IS

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:52.808 region:rollup2
THE DUTY THE COURTS.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:54.977 region:rollup2
JEALOUSLY GUARD OF THESE RIGHTS

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:56.846 region:rollup2
FROM LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:58.314 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS ALL

01:16:56.846 --> 01:17:00.182 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:02.118 region:rollup2
AND OBSTRUCTION TO THE BALLOT

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:04.019 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE PROCESS I WOULD URGE

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:05.788 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO. AND

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:07.123 region:rollup2
KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF THE BALLOT

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:09.091 region:rollup2
ISSUE PROCESS

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:10.292 region:rollup2
GIVEN MORE TIME.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.994 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THIS IS

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.195 region:rollup2
OBSTRUCTIONIST AND DEFINITELY

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:15.097 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD NOT

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.564 region:rollup2
THROW UP IN FOUGHT AGAINST THE

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:17.099 region:rollup2

ASSASSINATION OF DR KING.
