00:46:38.428 --> 00:46:40.898
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK. THAT

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.233
AND IT'S DOME IS SLIGHTLY

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.035
TILTED TOWARDS THE WEST TO MARK

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.070
THE END OF THE WEST CORD IT

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:49.806
EXPANSION AS WELL AS TO FAVOR.

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:52.109
THE MORE IMPORTANT SIDE WHICH

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:52.910
IS THE FRONT DOOR ON THE WEST

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.179
SIDE. AND THEN TO THE LEFT

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.980
THERE YOU SEE AN OVAL- THAT

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:59.883
USED TO BE A YAK CARRIAGEWAY.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.053
THAT ALSO REINFORCES THAT AXES

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.588
ANYTHING WHITE SAID THERE WAS

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:08.392
ALSO AN APPROACH. TO THE

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:09.026
BUILDING FROM THE EAST SIDE. A

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.594
LITTLE BIT OF HIS HERE AND YOU

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.462
KNOW AS YOU KNOW AS THE

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:14.131
BUILDING HAS INVOLVED THE

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.133
NEEDED FROM. AS WE GO ALONG TO

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.468
BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO. THE NEEDS

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.037
OF THE TIME YOU CAN SEE HERE

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:22.839
HOW TO CARRY TAXES. MOVE WAS

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.341
REPLACED BY THE AUTOMOBILE

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:27.377
ACTORS AND THEN. LATER ON IN

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.145
NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THE PROCESS

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:29.947
GOT LARGER AS THE POPULATION OF

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:34.117
CALIFORNIA. EXPANDED ANOTHER

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.819
HERE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:38.555
TURN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:39.289
NINETEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:41.225
FOUR. YOU CAN SEE HOW THE

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.593
MATURE TREES THAT WERE

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.394
RESPONDING TO THE ORIGINAL

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.697
GEOMETRY OF THE OF THE PARK. I

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.799
FRAMING THOSE VIEWS TO THE

00:47:48.865 --> 00:47:52.302
DOME. AS WELL AS THE PILOT WAS-

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.238
THAT EXISTED NOT TODAY A LITTLE

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.673
BIT FURTHER IMPORTS- USED TO BE

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.809
MARKING THAT THRESHOLD- TENTH

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:01.545
STREET THINK CREATING AN ENTRY

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:04.081
TO THE PARK. AND THEN LASTLY

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:06.116
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AND OF

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.985
THE CAPITALAND X. IN NINETEEN

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.053
FIFTY TWO. WITH NOTABLY AT THE

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.922
INTRODUCTION OF PARTICULAR

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.490
RAMPS TO ACCESS THAT BELOW

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:16.493
GRADE PARKING. IN THIS IS AN

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.428
IMAGE OF THE CAPITAL OF THE

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:21.932
CITY TODAY- THIS IMAGE ALONE.

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:25.602
IT PRESENTS- THAT. I THINK THAT

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.471
HOW HOW SIGNIFICANT AND

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.606
IMPORTANT THIS PROJECT IT AND

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:32.009
OBVIOUSLY IT TELLS ABOUT HOW

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:34.444
IMPORTANT IT IS TO RESPECT THIS

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:37.214
BILL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:38.682
WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.783
SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OF THE

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.551
HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING IF

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:44.521
THAT SETTING IS THAT MANY

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.323
THINGS HAVE HAD TO CHANGE TO

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.791
ADAPT TO THE TIMES AND THAT THE

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:50.994
IMPORTANT THING ST DOOR. AND

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.597
THAT WE THINK THAT. THE BEST

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.766
THING THAT WE CAN DO TO FOR

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:57.901
THAT CONTINUED INTO INDOOR. IS

00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:00.270
TO ACTUALLY. RESERVE A BUILDING

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.539
THAT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL. AND

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:05.108
EFFICIENT AS THE CALIFORNIA

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:06.476
CITY GOVERNMENT. SO VERY

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:08.312
IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANS FAT WE

00:49:08.378 --> 00:49:11.481
THINK. REGARDING THE ONYX-

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.583
THERE WAS A REPORT AND I THINK

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.086
OF MR COOLEY THE GERMAN COOLEY

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:18.955
RISK- REFER TO THIS THE FINAL

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:21.958
REPORT OF DECEMBER TWENTY

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:24.695
SEVENTEEN. WHICH THE CALL OUT

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:27.230
FOR A FEW DEFICIENCIES BY THE

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.566
ONYX BECAUSE THAT THAT ARE IN

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:32.202
NEED OF AFTER. AND THEY THEY

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.071
RANGE FROM LIKE FIFTY TO

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:37.140
ACCESSIBILITY. IN OVERCROWDING

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:38.709
AS YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:40.077
THE CIRCULATION PATHS ARE VERY

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:42.713
CROWDED AT TIMES. AND THEN ALSO

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.648
FROM THE WORK SPACE PERSPECTIVE

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:46.116
THERE ARE MANY SHORTCOMINGS FOR

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:48.051
THE SHORTCOMINGS BEING

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:52.356
DEFICIENCY BUT MEETING SPACE-

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:55.425
OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. AND

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.661
FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE SO MANY

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.629
THINGS THAT ARE ARE ARE

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:03.967
PERHAPS- NOT WORKING SO WELL IN

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.936
THE EXISTING ON. CONSEQUENTLY

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:10.674
THE L. THE COMMITTEE YES. SHOW

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:14.378
UP I NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ.

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:18.715
HI CONSEQUENTLY- THE- PROJECT

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.317
OVERVIEW IN SEQUENCE REPORT

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:23.854
WAS- I ADOPTED TO NOT ADDRESS

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.689
TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS IS A

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:28.158
THIS REPORT. I CAN YOU HEAR ME

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:30.794
NOW YEAH. YEAH THIS REPORTS- A

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:33.997
STATES THIS PRINCIPLES I'M MORE

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:38.301
ALONG. OTHER USEFUL DESIGN

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.804
GUIDELINES THAT WILL. INFORM AT

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.139
THE DESIGN TEAM ON HOW TO

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:46.109
PROCEED AND WITH THE PROJECT.

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:49.846
SO THE VERY FIRST OF THOSE

00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:51.848
PRINCIPLES IS TO BE INCLUSIVE

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:54.584
AND WELCOME OBVIOUSLY I WAS

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.720
CALIFORNIA AS A BECAUSE OF THE

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.089
PEOPLE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:03.093
THAT IT BE INCLUSIVE AND. AND

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.227
WELCOMING THAT'D BE INVITING.

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:06.263
THAT'D BE TRANSPARENT IN THOSE

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:09.266
OF ARCHITECTS SAY IT REQUIRES

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.601
THAT THE BUILDING BE VERYPOOR.

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:14.438
AND NOTHING BETTER. TO START

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:15.605
THAT FEROCITY THAT WITH THE

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:19.109
FRONT DOOR AS WELL AS

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:21.044
MAINTAINING- THREE OTHER

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:22.446
ENTRIES ON THE NORTH SOUTH AND

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:24.481
EAST. THE VISITOR CENTER

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:26.316
PERHAPS ENTRANCE IS THE MOST

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:27.651
IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THAT

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.453
RESTORES THE HISTORICAL AND

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:34.591
CURRENT. NEXT WILL BE THE

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:36.359
ENTRANCE WILL HAVE SOME

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:37.961
INTERESTING BILLS THAT WOULD BE

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.663
EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST IN THE

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.998
SECURITY PROCESSES. AS WELL AS

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.468
IN TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE NEEDS

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:47.571
OF THE VISITORS THE MEATS AND

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:49.906
ALSO OBVIOUSLY AFFECT YOU. AND

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:50.807
THAT IT WILL BE FULLY

00:51:50.874 --> 00:51:52.909
ACCESSIBLE THROUGHOUT BOTH

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:57.113
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. AS WE

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.582
ACCESS THE BUILDING. THERE'S A

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:01.551
NEED. TO RELIEVE THAT

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.520
OVERCROWDING IN WE THINK THAT

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:05.222
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:52:05.288 --> 00:52:07.157
IS A FEW COMMENTS INTO THE

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.893
BUILDING IS TO HAVE A AMPLE-

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.662
PUBLIC A SPACE THAT WILL BE

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:16.566
ABLE TO BE SAFE- THAT THAT THAT

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:17.934
CAN I BELIEVE THAT OVERCROWDING

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.036
AND PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:23.440
ACCESS. AND THAT WILL BE.

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:26.543
COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED AND

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.913
OBVIOUSLY IT ALSO- PEOPLE CAN

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.882
FEEL PRIDE OFTEN THIS IS THIS

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.817
IS THAT IT IMAGES OF VERY

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:35.652
CONCEPTUAL IMAGES OF WHAT THAT

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.988
THE SPACE MICHAEL TALK ABOUT.

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.923
ONE IN THE VISITOR CENTER AND

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.958
THE OTHER IN THE ONYX IN WILL

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:44.060
BE ABLE TO REFER BACK TO THE-

00:52:44.127 --> 00:52:50.634
TO THE TO THE- DAHLE. ANOTHER

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.235
OF THE PRINCIPLE THIS TO BE ONE

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:54.504
BUILDING AND THAT REFERS BACK

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.640
AS HAVING THE ABILITY TO

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:59.075
CONNECT- BOTH THE HISTORIC

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:02.078
BUILDING. AND THE AND THE AND

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:04.281
THE NEW ANNEX AND NOTHING

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.416
BETTER TO DO THAT THAN A LINING

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.485
THE FLOORS SPECIFICALLY. TO BE

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.554
ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.155
SEEMINGLY THEME AND TO BE ABLE

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:15.158
TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT ALL

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:18.328
FUNCTIONS AS ONE BUILDING. AND

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.297
THEN IT DOESN'T PRINCIPLE THE

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.498
CALL IT'S CALLED EDUCATION SEE

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.667
TO EVERYTHING WHICH HE RELATES

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.935
TO THE- TO FACILITATING A

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:27.404
PRODUCTIVE- PRODUCTIVE WORK DAY

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.205
AND ALL OF YOU THAT LIVE IN

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:30.106
THIS BUILDING KNOW HOW

00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:31.708
IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE CLOSE TO

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.910
EVERYTHING. AND THIS IS ONE OF

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:36.046
THE THINGS THAT WE TAKE- FROM

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.881
THE EXISTING ONYX THAT. WE

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.383
THINK THAT IT WORKS WELL AS A

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:40.951
DAY BECAUSE THIS CONTINUOUS

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.053
CIRCULATION NO DEAD ENDS.

00:53:43.119 --> 00:53:46.923
FIGURE EIGHT CIRCULATION THAT

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.490
ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE IN THE U.

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.159
YOUR TO GO TO WHERE YOU NEED TO

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:50.627
BE FILLED. WOULD LIKE TO BRING

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:53.964
THAT. INTO THE NEW NEW DESIGN

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:57.067
AND BE ABLE TO CONNECT AND ON

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.102
CONTINUOUS FLOW. AND THEN BE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.604
FUNCTIONAL AND OBVIOUSLY ALL

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:01.771
FLOORS NEED TO BE FUNCTIONAL

00:54:01.838 --> 00:54:03.206
BUT THIS FLOOR THE SECOND FLOOR

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.574
WERE SPENDING RIGHT NOW IS

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.675
CRITICAL IN TERMS IT'S NOT

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.477
WISHING THE CONNECTIONS OF THE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.345
ASSEMBLY TO THE REST OF THE

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.747
FLOOR. AS WELL AS THIS THE SET

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:12.415
THE ENTRY LEVEL FLOOR WE CALL

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.551
THIS LEVEL. THE GARDEN LEVEL

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:16.686
THIS IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE- THE

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:18.755
FIRST LEVEL OF THE ROTUNDA. BUT

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:20.223
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.992
AS THEY COME IN AND HAVE A VERY

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:26.396
GOOD WAY FINDING- WAIT TO GET

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.832
INTO THE BUILDING. SO WITH THAT

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.467
I LIKE TO. PASS IT ON TO MY

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.502
COLLEAGUE- CHLOE LOGS THAT THEY

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.804
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE SITE

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:56.860
IN SOME OF THE. THANK YOU JOSE.

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:58.328
SO THE CAPITOL BUILDING IS

00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.896
DESIGNED TO SET SLIGHTLY

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.931
ELEVATED ABOUT THE POCK AND

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.066
THIS IS BOTH TO PROTECT IT FROM

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.801
FLOODING BUT ALSO TO GIVE IT

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:07.103
ITS CIVIC PRESENCE AND THAT'S

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.238
CIVIC PRESENCE IS FURTHER

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.040
ENHANCED BY THE GEOMETRY OF THE

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:11.808
POCK WHEREVER YOU'RE STANDING

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:15.011
THE PODS DIRECTING POINTS OF

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.880
VIEWS TOWARDS THE CAPITAL TO.

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:18.248
AND ALTHOUGH TODAY THOSE POTS

00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:19.883
AND JAVA TREES HAVE CHANGED

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:22.118
SLIGHTLY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.386
PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THOSE

00:55:23.453 --> 00:55:24.788
VIEWS ARE VERY MUCH STILL

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:29.325
PRESENT. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY IS

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.361
TO REINFORCE THE HISTORICALLY

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.996
THE HISTORICAL PROMINENCE OF

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.931
THE AXES AND ESPECIALLY THE

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:38.435
WEST IT'S AXES. BY REINSTATING

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:40.704
AND REINFORCING THE WEST ENTRY

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:44.007
WHICH TODAY IS AND USE. AS WELL

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.310
AS REINFORCING THE EAST ENTRY.

00:55:47.377 --> 00:55:48.945
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND READY

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.613
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THIS

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.948
IDEA THAT THE CAPITAL IS A

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.050
BUILDING WITHIN A POCK AND THIS

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.819
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:58.555
DESIGN TEAM AND MAXIMIZING IN

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:00.056
HAN SAYING AND PROTECTING THE

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.691
PARK IS ONE OF UTMOST

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:04.894
PRIORITIES. RIGHT NOW THE

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.796
EXISTING THE EXISTING RAMPS

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.465
DOWN TO THE PARKING READY

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.366
BIFURCATE THE POCK AND IMPEDE A

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:13.403
FREE AND EASY FLOW OF

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.371
CIRCULATION FOR PEDESTRIANS.

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:17.207
HOWEVER WE SEE A READY GREAT

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:19.209
OPPORTUNITY TO RELOCATE THOSE

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:21.711
RAMPS. AND THEREFORE COMPLETELY

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.046
RECONNECT THE POCK READY

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:26.549
ALLOWING. PEDESTRIANS TO SAFELY

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.051
ONE THE POP CONNECTING THE SIDE

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:30.820
OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS TO THE

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:31.454
EAST SIDE OF THE POT. WHICH WE

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.289
THINK IS A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:36.426
TO THE PROJECT. AND BECAUSE THE

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:38.795
CAPITAL IS- SLIGHTLY ELEVATED

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:40.463
FROM ITS NEIGHBORING STREETS

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.599
THIS NEW POP CONNECTION REALLY

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:44.000
HELPS US FACILITATE TRUE

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:47.303
UNIVERSAL ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:47.837
SITES AS WELL AS INTO THE

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.940
BUILDING. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:52.675
CONSIDERATION OF THE TREATIES.

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:53.710
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.245
DEDICATED IN LARGE TREES AROUND

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:58.047
THE SITE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE A

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.116
HANDFUL OF DEDICATED SMALL

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.719
TREES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:03.219
ANNEX BUT CAN BE EASILY

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:06.256
RELOCATED. THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:07.490
TREES ON THE SOUTH AND THE

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.125
NORTH AND NOT IMPACTED AT ALL

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:11.261
BY THE FOOTPRINT OF THE ANNEX

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:11.895
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:14.998
LATER. HOWEVER THE FOOTPRINT OF

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:16.332
THE PARKING WAS A BIT MORE

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.067
CHALLENGING FOR THE DESIGN TEAM

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.068
AND WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:21.337
DIFFERENT OPTIONS. WE LOOKED AT

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:23.039
LOCATING IT ON THE SOUTH SIDE.

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.440
AS WELL AS ON THE NORTH SIDE

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:25.909
AND AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.677
LOCATIONS IMPACT THE TREES

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.879
QUITE SEVERELY. AS WELL AS BOTH

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.714
OF THEM REQUIRING A SECOND

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:32.916
MEANS OF EGRESS WHICH WOULD

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:35.652
MEAN FURTHER IMPACTING THE POP

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:36.252
AND TUNNELLING UNDERNEATH THE

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.054
BUILDING. AND SO THE DESIGN

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.190
TEAM SAID ON A ON A LOCATION TO

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.692
THE EAST WEAVING THE PARKING-

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.260
BELOW THIS PAUL STREET RIGHT OF

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:46.429
WAY AND READY HAVING THE LEAST

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.264
AMOUNT OF IMPACT ON THE TREES.

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:49.232
AND HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.501
BASEMENT PLAN UP THE PARKING.

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:52.735
YOU CAN SEE HOW WE'VE LOCATED

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.137
THE RAMPS TO THE PREFERRED TO

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:55.371
THE PERMIT UP IN THE NORTH AND

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:56.573
THE SOUTH AGAIN READY

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:58.775
MAXIMIZING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:01.578
WITHIN THE POP. AND WE HAVE

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:04.113
READY TIA TWO ENTRIES FROM AND

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.216
THEN L. STREET. AS WELL AS A

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:07.717
TWO MEANS OF EGRESS BOTH OF

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.986
WHICH COULD BE EASILY REVERSED

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:12.255
OF THE CITY STREETS CHANGE. AND

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.556
ANOTHER GREAT PET BENEFITS OF

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.258
LOCATING THE PARKING AT IS THAT

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.926
THE LEAD OF THE PARKING CAN

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.461
BECOME A READY GREAT PEDESTRIAN

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.430
PROMENADE THAT CONNECTS. ALLEN

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:43.866
KNOW TODAY- ALL OF THE VISITORS

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.135
AS WELL AS- MEMBERS AND

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:47.603
EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING HERE

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.538
COMES THROUGH THE TWO PRIMARY

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.473
DOORS NORTH AND SOUTH AND

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.375
THERE'S A NEW STORE- WHAT THIS

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.144
DOES IS IT CREATES PITCH POINTS

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.179
AND IT CREATES CONFLICT- WITHIN

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.715
THOSE MAJOR CORRIDORS. BY

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:00.983
HAVING THE WEST ENTRY WE CAN

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.918
TAKE THOSE- SCHOOL GROUPS TOUR

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.853
GROUPS AND VISITORS AND HAVE

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.259
THEM COME IN- GATHER AND GET

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:10.826
READY FOR THEIR TOUR USE THE

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:11.427
RESTROOMS AND THEN AND ORGAN

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.995
MANNER TAKE THE TOUR AND GO

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:14.363
THROUGH THAT WITHOUT CREATING A

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.465
LOT OF CONGESTION FOR MEMBERS

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:17.299
AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:19.435
WORKING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.337
SO IT IMPROVES THE CIRCULATION-

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.940
BY PULLED TOGETHER AND ALLOWING

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:26.675
FOR THE GROUPS TO ASSEMBLE AND

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.578
THEIR LOGICAL LOCATIONS IT

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:30.846
IMPROVED LEARNING BE IT ALLOWS

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.915
FOR US TO DEVELOP EXHIBITS AND

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.550
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CALIFORNIA

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.685
DEMOCRACY. WITHIN THE VISITOR

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:37.786
CENTER TO WHERE THEY CAN TAKE

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:39.188
THE TIME AND THEY CAN LEARN

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.689
ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN STANDING

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.491
IN THE HALLWAY IS LOOKING AT

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.159
THE CURRENT EXHIBITS AND

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:47.663
CONTESTING THAT AND IT IMPROVES

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:48.564
THE OVERALL FUNCTION. OF THE

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.332
ANNEX BY SEPARATING THESE TWO

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.166
FUNCTIONS INTO THEIR

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:53.802
APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS IT ALLOWS

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.205
FOR THE- FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS AND

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.973
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT'S BEING

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.043
BUILT IN THE ANNEX BEING USED.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.611
TO HELP- FURTHER THOSE

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:05.581
ACTIVITIES AND IT ALLOWS FOR

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:08.317
THE LEARNING CURRENTLY WE HAVE

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.252
BROKEN THE VISITOR CENTER INTO

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:11.854
TWO DISCRETE PHASES AS KONG

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.089
MENTIONED. PHASE ONE IS WHERE

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.190
WE BUILD THE SHELL OF THE

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.059
BUILDING WE BUILD THE ENTRY

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.560
PORTIONS WHERE THE SECURITY AS

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:20.462
WE BUILD THE GATHERING PLACES.

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:21.997
AND WE BUILD THE RESTROOMS WE

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.032
BUILD THE CONNECTION TO THE-

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:27.703
WEST WING- THE POS BUDGET AS-

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.671
ADDENDA FIDE IN THE DOCUMENT

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:30.472
WAS THIRTY TWO POINT TWO

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.341
MILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.143
CURRENTLY AT ABOUT FORTY POINT

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:36.278
EIGHT AND- THAT PROJECT HAS

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:37.846
BEEN PUT ON HOLD WE BELIEVE

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.014
THAT IF THIS PROJECT WAS TO

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.716
MOVE FORWARD WE COULD FIND WAYS

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.484
TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT. WE

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.485
ARE CURRENTLY IN IN WHAT'S

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.120
CALLED THE CONCEPTUAL PHASE

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:46.455
WHICH MEANING IS WERE RIGHT AT

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:47.689
THE VERY BEGINNING WE STILL

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.624
HAVE SCHEMATIC DESIGN AND

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.159
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.060
DOCUMENTS TO GO THROUGH. AND AS

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.095
WE GET MORE INTO THE PROJECT

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.730
AND WE LEARN MORE WE BELIEVE

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:57.366
THAT WE ARE ABLE WILL BE ABLE

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:58.467
TO TIGHTEN THAT BUDGET UP.

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.035
PHASE TWO. IS REALLY THE

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.670
EXHIBIT PHASE IN THIS IS NOT

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.573
BEEN FUNDED- AS YOU YOU MAY OR

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.809
MAY NOT KNOW THE- EXHIBITS WERE

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.178
NOT PART OF THE APPROPRIATION

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.145
AND SO THAT NEEDS TO STILL BE

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:12.214
FUNDED. ONCE THE EXHIBITS ARE

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.315
DETERMINED THEN WE CAN

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.817
DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF BUILD

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:17.319
OUT WHAT KIND OF. FINISHES WE

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.154
NEED WITHIN THE ORIENTATIONS

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.656
ROOMS AND WITHIN THE EXHIBIT

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.791
SPACE. OUR EXPECTATION AT THIS

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.126
POINT RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'RE

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:25.527
LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.962
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EXHIBIT

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:29.832
PHASE. AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:31.934
BE A NEW APPROPRIATIONS SO

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.602
CURRENTLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:34.837
HAVING THE VISITOR CENTER ON

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.371
HOLD WHICH IS WHERE IT

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:38.106
CURRENTLY IS. IS THAT IT

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:40.742
REQUIRES US TO INCREASE CERTAIN

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:44.746
CIRCULATION ACTIVITIES WITHIN

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.715
THE- THE WE WILL NEED

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:48.217
ADDITIONAL SPACE WITHIN THE

01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:49.852
SECURITY AREAS SO THAT WE CAN

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.353
HANDLE THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.890
THAT ARE COMING IN. RATHER THAN

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:55.490
JUST HAVING THEM COME IN WITH

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.859
THE NORMAL TRAFFIC SO THAT'LL

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:00.028
INCREASE. IN SOME AREAS ONE TO

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.331
TWO MAGNETOMETERS- WE ALSO NEED

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:03.866
ADDITIONAL RESTROOMS TO BE

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.734
PLACED- WHICH WILL CHEW UP A

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.636
LITTLE BIT OF THE- FUNCTIONAL

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.271
SPACE THAT'LL HAPPEN BOTH ON

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.440
THE- GARDEN LEVEL AND ON THE

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.976
FIRST FLOOR. AND THEN- THE

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.477
BIGGEST IMPACT IS REALLY THE

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.212
CIRCULATION SPACE BECAUSE WE

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.013
NEED TO ACCOMMODATE

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.781
APPROXIMATELY. A MILLION

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.450
VISITORS A YEAR AND I WILL TELL

01:15:21.516 --> 01:15:23.518
YOU THAT ONCE THIS IS DONE. ONE

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:24.987
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.588
IN THE FOR CAPITALS THAT WE

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.589
HAVE DONE IS THE SPIKE OF

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:29.791
VISITORS GOES THROUGH THE ROOF-

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.894
IN UTAH WE SOUGHT TRIPLE. IN

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.462
MINNESOTA WE SOUGHT DOUBLE IN

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:36.965
IN WYOMING THEY SET RECORDS-

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.568
FOR VISITORS- IN FACT WHEN WE

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.603
OPEN TO WYOMING STATE CAPITOL

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.238
THEY HAD PEOPLE. ALL THE WAY

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.173
OUT ONTO THE LAWN AND DOWN THE

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.509
STREET- THE LARGEST CROWD SAID

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.478
THEY'D EVER SEEN SO. YOU WILL

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:50.946
HAVE AN INCREASE IN VISITOR

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.247
TRAFFIC SO THAT ONE MILLION

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.783
VISITORS IS LIKELY TO GO UP.

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.884
NOW WHETHER IT DOUBLES IT OR

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:58.120
NOT I CAN'T SAY BUT- WE NEED TO

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.554
MAKE SURE WE ACCOMMODATE THE

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.256
CIRCULATION CAPABILITIES WITH

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.325
WITHIN THE BUILDING. THEREFORE

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.660
WE HAVE. HAD TO ADD

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.361
APPROXIMATELY YOUR USE

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.330
APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.197
FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. OR

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:10.632
IT'S COSTING US ABOUT SIX

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.668
MILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT FORTY

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.103
MILLION DOLLARS ANYWAY TO-

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.306
UTILIZE OUR TO PREPARE THE

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:18.974
ANNEX TO RECEIVE. THOSE

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.009
VISITORS. NOW WE HAVE DONE SOME

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:22.878
STUDIES WITH REGARDS TO HOW

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.646
THAT LAYS OUT SO ON THE LEFT

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.481
YOU CAN SEE. IN THESE NEXT

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.817
DIAGRAMS THE LAY OUT OF WHAT WE

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:32.020
CALL THE DOUBLE T. AND WILL

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:32.621
ALSO GO THROUGH THE CIRCLE IN

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:33.155
THIS WHERE. BUT THAT'S THE

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:33.989
SPACE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:36.725
ALLOCATE. IF THERE WAS. NO

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.827
VISITOR CENTER IF WE BUILD THE

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:40.595
VISITOR CENTER. THEN IN THE

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.164
NEXTAG GRAHAM TO THE RIGHT YOU

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.932
CAN SEE THAT IN THE RED AREA WE

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.101
ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THAT SQUARE

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.569
FOOTAGE. AND VIRTUALLY SAVE

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.571
THOSE DOLLARS FROM HAVING TO

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.974
BUILD THAT. THE BLUE AREA IS

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.175
SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT WE'RE ABLE

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:55.110
TO REPURPOSE AND PUT BACK INTO

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.212
THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS. TO WEAR

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.914
BOTH ON THE GARDEN LEVEL WHICH

01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:00.215
IS WHERE THE HEARING ROOMS ARE

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.817
AND ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH IS

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.452
WHERE THE EXECUTIVE SUITES ARE.

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.653
THEY WILL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.221
USE THAT FOR OFFICE FUNCTIONS

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.956
OR FOR HEARING OR FUNCTIONS.

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:09.658
AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ALL

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.659
THREE OF THESE IT'S

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:13.895
APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ABOUT.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:14.529
ELEVEN TO TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:15.630
FEET COULD BE ELIMINATED

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.399
THEREBY SAVING US SOME MONEY.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.868
AND APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.536
SQUARE FEET CAN BE REPURPOSED.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.405
AND SO IN THE DOUBLE T. YOU SAW

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.073
THAT IN THE CIRCLE YOU CAN SEE

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.575
WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:29.077
REGAIN SOME OF THE- FUNCTIONAL

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.246
SPACE. AND IN THE SQUARE YOU'LL

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.849
SEE THAT NOW YOU'LL SEE MORE OF

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:34.549
THESE DESIGNS IN A FEW MINUTES

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.918
WHEN JOSE PRESENTS THOSE. IN

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.820
SUMMARY WHAT THAT REALLY SAYS

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:40.722
IS THAT WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.591
TWO POINTS ONE POINT TWO

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.459
MILLION AND ONE POINT THREE

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:46.928
MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. AND

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.463
WE ARE ABLE TO REPURPOSE

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.232
BETWEEN THREE POINT OR FOUR

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:54.002
POINT SIX. FOUR FOUR THOUSAND

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.238
SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. TO

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.774
FOURTH- TWO THREE THOUSAND NINE

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.674
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET SO IT'S A-

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.309
IT'S A GOOD BENEFIT TO BE ABLE

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:04.646
TO USE THOSE SPACES IN A IN A

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.915
DIFFERENT WAY. SO AS YOU SIT

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:08.383
AND CONSIDER THIS TODAY WE

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:09.584
RECOGNIZE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.086
QUORUM BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.522
HAVE YOUR DIRECTION- IN THE

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:15.490
NEAR FUTURE WITH REGARDS TO

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:16.425
WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.093
THIS CONTIUE OR WHETHER YOU'D

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.529
LIKE TO SEE A STAY ON HOLD. AND

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.931
WITH THAT I WILL. TURN THE TIME

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:25.567
OVER TO JOSE. WHO WILL TAKE US

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:26.168
THROUGH THE DISCUSSION ON THE

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:44.419
ANNEX.

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:50.625
SO. I HEARD PLOY AND I

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.394
WILL BE TAKING YOU THROUGH THE

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.729
WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN- PUTTING

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.299
TOGETHER FOR THE CAPITAL THE

01:18:57.365 --> 01:19:00.235
CAPITAL AND X. THE TEAM HAS

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:02.337
PREPARED THAT- THREE

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.172
ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.874
THIS CONCEPT TO CALL THE DOUBLE

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:09.311
T. CIRCLE IN THE SQUARE. AND

01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:12.214
WE'RE GONNA PRESENT ADMIN- AND-

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.149
IN THIS SORT OF FORMAT THE ALL

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:16.818
THREE TOGETHER BECAUSE AS THEY

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.220
RESPOND TO THE PRINCIPLES AND

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.255
GUIDELINES SET UP BY THE P. O.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.757
S. AS WELL AS THEY ALL HAVE THE

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.093
SAME PROGRAMMATIC- ELEMENTS.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.863
THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR- HOWEVER.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:31.199
THEY ALSO AVE SOME- DIFFERENT

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:34.402
ATTRIBUTES FOR THE WILL LIKE TO

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:35.203
POINT OUT TO YOU. SO THE THREE

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.805
IMAGES THE BOTTOM- YOU KNOW

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:39.274
POINT OUT HOW. THE THAT

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.842
PNEUMATIC SORT OF SITS IS TO

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.077
THE WEST SIDE OF THE OF THE

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.212
WEST WING AND NESTLED IN

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.381
BETWEEN THE TREES. AND THAT IT

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.818
IS- YOU KNOW- RESPECTFUL OF THE

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:52.754
HISTORIC BUILDING. ALL THREE OF

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.523
THE SCHEMES ALLOW FOR THAT TACK

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.925
CRITICAL PRODUCTION CONNECTION

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.693
THAT KHLOE MENTIONED AND WE

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.663
THINK THIS IS A GREAT BENEFIT.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.165
TO THE PROJECT INTO THE PARK.

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.934
SO ALL THREE DO THAT THEY ALSO.

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:08.069
HAVE MAINTAIN THOSE VIEWS TO

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.404
THAT TO THAT DAHLE MAY NEED

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:11.640
SOME CASES- MAYBE ENHANCE IT A

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:24.319
LITTLE BIT. YES. VERY. THE

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:37.766
LITTLE BLACK HOURS. AND OTHER

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:40.635
THE PALM TREE SORRY THE

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:43.305
RESOLUTION ON THE SCREEN IS NOW.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:57.352
YEAH YEAH YES. YEAH WHERE ARE

01:20:57.419 --> 01:21:00.655
SHOWING THE- AT RIGHT LOCATION

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:02.490
OF ALL THE TREES THAT CAREFULLY

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:04.693
SURVEYED THAT FILL ALL THE

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.994
TREES ARE YOU SEE IN OUR IMAGES

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.896
ARE IN THE RIGHT LOCATION AT

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.233
THE RIGHT TIME. ALL OF THE

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.735
SCHEME IS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:16.605
TO REVEAL- A PORTION OF THE

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:17.939
WEST WING FACADE THAT NOW IS

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:21.476
COVERED BY BY THE ONYX- SO WE

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:25.113
THINK THAT IS ALSO A BENEFIT-

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:25.647
THAT THAT NEW PROJECT WILL

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:29.217
BRING. ALL THREE SCHEMES OF

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.653
THREE CONCEPTS- ALSO STATE WAY

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.422
BELOW THE AT WHAT WE CALL THE

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:35.257
ONE TWENTY FIVE FOOT LINE WHICH

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:38.226
IS MARKING THE BOTTOM. OF THE

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:40.328
COLONNADE OF THAT ON THE DOME

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.030
SO NOT NON OF THE BUILDING

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:45.066
ELEMENTS WOULD GO TO ALL BE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.768
GOING ABOVE THAT. ALL THREE

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:49.471
SCHEMES ALSO ARE RELATING TO

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.006
THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.575
WEST WING MAINLY THE CORNERS

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:54.109
AND THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE

01:21:54.175 --> 01:21:56.578
STRAIGHT. THEY ALSO REVEAL A

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:57.879
BIT BACK YOU CAN SEE THERE IN

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.782
THE PLAN- FROM THE WEST WING TO

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.450
SET IT UP OPPOSITE MORE

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:03.418
IMPORTANT TYPE OF BUILDING

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.487
THERE FOR. OUR PHRASE THAT WE

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.455
USE THAT THIS CALL THAT THE

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.190
WEST WING NEEDS TO BE FIRST

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:12.494
AMONG EQUALS. AND IT OBVIOUSLY

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:13.895
WORKED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.764
SURROUNDING TREES BECAUSE THEY

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.265
ARE PART OF THE OVERALL

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.968
COMPOSITION. AND THEY HELP US

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.703
SET UP THE WEST WING ALSO AS

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.639
THE MOST IMPORTANT- BUILDING AT

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:29.144
ON THE FIVE. ALL THREE SCHEMES-

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.313
CAPITALIZE ON ON ACCESS TO

01:22:31.379 --> 01:22:32.781
DAYLIGHT IMPUSO WHO OBVIOUSLY

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.949
OF ALL THE SPACES THAT ARE

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:37.218
ABOVE GROUND THERE'S A MAJOR

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.386
DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.188
DOUBLE T. AND THE CIRCLE IN THE

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:43.024
SQUARE IN THAT THAT DOUBLE T.

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:45.460
IS LOOKING OUTWARDS MOST OF THE

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:47.362
STATE WITH THE WORK SPACES AT

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.064
LOOKING OUTWARDS. WHEREAS IN

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:51.933
THE CIRCLE AND IN THE SQUARE AT%

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.036
BOTH- INWARDS AND OUTWARDS

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:57.072
VIEWS WILL BE PROVIDED. YOU CAN

01:22:57.138 --> 01:22:58.740
SEE THERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.875
A NEW WORD FOR YOU THEY'LL BE

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.444
ABLE TO LOOK INTO THIS

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.880
COURTYARD AND HAVE USED TO THE

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.615
TO THE DAHLE. AND THEN THE ODD

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:09.384
WORD BE WITH WILL BE OBVIOUSLY

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:13.888
TO THE PARK AND THE THREE. ALL

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:16.324
THE THREE SCHEMES- HAVE ADOPTED

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:17.992
THE CNCEPT THAT WE TALKED

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.561
ABOUT EARLIER THAT IS BROUGHT

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.663
ABOUT FROM FROM THE EXISTING

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.699
IONIC SIX THAT ARE. THE HEAD

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:26.935
CONTINUOUS CIRCULATION. AND ALL

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:27.936
THE OBVIOUSLY THAT IS BROUGHT

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:31.873
IN INTO THE CHAMBERS AND OTHER

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.440
ELEMENTS OF THE WEST WING AS

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:36.511
WELL. VERTICALLY ALL THREE

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:38.046
SCHEMES WILL HAVE- THREE GROUPS

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.681
OF ELEVATOR I MEAN FOR GROUPS

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:40.915
OF ELEVATORS THAT WILL BE

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.684
DISTRIBUTED WRONG ARE ALONG THE

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.853
FLOORS-TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:47.622
ALL FLOORS. AND THAT'S WHERE

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.091
ALL THE ENTRYWAYS CONVERGE AT

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.560
THE NEXUS OF IT WILL HAVE. ALSO

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:54.963
A PUBLIC STAIRWAY- THAT WILL

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:57.031
CONNECT BOTH ALL THE FLOORS OF

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.733
THE WEST WING IN ALL THE

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.604
FLOORS. ON THE NEW IPHONE X.

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:04.639
THIS IS SPACE THAT WE'RE USING

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.107
TO PUT THE STAIRWAY IS-

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.610
REMINISCENT OF- THE OLD APPS

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:12.347
THAT WITH STAKING OUT WHEN THE

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:12.947
NINETEEN FIFTY TO ANNEX WITH

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:15.517
IN. SO WE'RE TAKING A LITTLE

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:18.019
BIT OF THAT HISTORY INTO THE

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.688
NEW PROJECT. AND THEN HEAR SOME

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.823
VIEWS OF WHAT THAT IS THERE

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.658
MIGHT LOOK LIKE- OBVIOUSLY WILL

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.627
LIKE TO PUT FROM ACCESS TO

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.295
DAYLIGHT AT THE TOP AND HAVE

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.531
THE ABILITY TO. RECALL THE

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:32.434
DOME. IF YOU WALK UP THE STAIRS

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.802
THERE'S A SPARE WILL BE VERY

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.603
IMPORTANT AND FOR VISITORS TO

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:36.638
BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.440
ENTRY LEVEL WHAT WE CALL THE

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:40.809
GARDEN LEVEL. UP TO THE ROTUNDA

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:41.943
LEVELING EVEN TO THE SECOND

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.446
LEVEL AND THEN OTHER USERS IN

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.948
THE IT AND THE STAFF AND

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.016
VISITORS WILL BE ABLE TO DO

01:24:48.082 --> 01:24:52.454
THIS. USE THE SPARE. FOR

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.056
CIRCULATION BETWEEN FLOORS. WE

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.558
TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:57.959
FLOOR ALIGNMENTS ALL THREE

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.728
SCHEMES ARE DOING JUST THAT IT.

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:03.164
HOWEVER WE'VE- I DID A

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.699
MEZZANINE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.534
SECOND FLOOR BECAUSE WE WERE

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.770
BUILDING QUITE A BIT OF VOLUME-

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.972
BECAUSE OF THE ALIGNMENT. OF

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.041
THE OF THE OF THE FLOORS TO THE

01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:15.243
KING TO THE WEST WING WE WERE

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:17.011
ALREADY HAVING THAT ABILITY TO

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:19.247
INSERT A MEZZANINE THERE TO

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.516
CAPITALIZE ON THE EFFICIENCY OF

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:23.651
THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE BUILDING.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.720
PROGRAMMATIC LEE- ALL OF THE

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.055
WORK SPACE ESPECIALLY THE

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.356
MEMBER SWEETS AND ALL OF

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:29.757
SUPPORT THE SPACES WILL BE

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:30.925
LOCATED FROM THE SECOND FLOOR

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:34.462
UP WITH OBVIOUSLY VERY

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.631
IMPORTANT AT CONNECTION TO

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.066
CHAMBERS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:42.036
THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR WILL BE

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:45.673
ASSIST NOW IN THE FIRST FLOOR.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:46.241
ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:49.210
THERE. AND THEN THESE NEWLY

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:50.478
DEVELOPED FLOOR THAT WE CALL

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.981
THE GARDEN LEVEL THAT HAS

01:25:53.047 --> 01:25:55.416
ACCESS. TO TWELVE THREE RIGHT

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:56.818
AWAY YOU MIGHT REMEMBER CHLOE

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.420
TOLD US THAT THIS BUILDING IS A

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:02.357
SLIGHTLY- PERCHED UP ABOVE THE

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.758
SURROUNDING STREETS SO THAT

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:07.195
FACILITATES. AN ENTRY RIGHT-

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:09.664
BELOW THE FIRST LEVEL AT IT

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:12.534
WHICH IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.738
PUT ALL OF THE HIGHLY ACCESS-

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.640
THE SPACES THAT NEED YOU HAVE A

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:21.009
LOT OF ACCESS FROM THE PUBLIC

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:22.076
PERSPECTIVE WHICH ARE THE HERE

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.212
ROOMS FOR ALL THE KIßM

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.713
HEARING RIVER LOCATED IN THIS

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.448
FLOOR. AND THAT GIVES US ALSO

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.317
AN ADVANTAGE FROM A LIFE SAFETY

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:31.286
PERSPECTIVE IN THAT WE CAN EXIT

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:35.156
A STRAIGHT OUT. ONTO THE TO THE

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.391
SIDEWALK. AND THEN LASTLY THE

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:39.260
BASEMENT BASEMENT THAT HOUSES-

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:41.195
SOME- COMMITTEE ROOMS AS WELL

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:43.398
AS OTHER SUPPORT SPACES. AND

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:47.235
ALSO PROVIDES- AT- AN ENTRY

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:47.769
FROM THE PARKING INTO THE

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:51.906
BUILDING. WE TALKED A LITTLE

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:53.808
BIT ABOUT THAT PUBLIC FACING

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:54.809
THE PORTENTS OF THIS PUBLIC

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.211
SPACE YOU CAN SEE HERE- SOME OF

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:59.147
THE IMAGES BELOW WHAT THAT.

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:01.516
MIGHT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HOWEVER

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:05.086
SOME DIFFERENCES THE DOUBLE T.

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.522
IS A NARROW AND- VERY TALL

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.724
ATRIUM SPACE WHERE THE PUBLIC

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:12.627
WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE OF

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.495
THE SPACE AND AT EVERY LEVEL.

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.464
IN OTHER WORDS THE PUBLIC WILL

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.266
BE ABLE TO. BE LOOKING DOWN

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:19.968
INTO THE SPACE YOU KNOW ALL THE

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:22.103
WAY FROM THE TOP OR OR AT ANY

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:24.272
LEVEL THAT ONE. THERE AT THAT

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:26.507
WHEREAS THE CIRCLE AND A DOUBLE

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:29.911
P. AS MORE OF A BROADER TYPE OF

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:30.645
SPACE MORE ABOUT A CALL IN THE

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:33.247
PUBLIC ROOM. BUT IT ALSO ONLY

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:37.385
CONNECTS- THAT CARD LEVEL IN

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:37.986
THE FIRST LEVEL SO IT'S A TWO

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:41.689
STORY. INSTEAD OF- ALL THE WAY

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:44.425
UP. EIGHT THE VIEW A LITTLE BIT

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:45.960
SO BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:46.794
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.097
THE SCHEME. HERE'S A DOUBLE T.

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:51.766
AND- IN THAT IN THAT. IMAGE IT

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.167
THERE TOO TO THE RIGHT THERE'S

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:55.837
A PRECEDENT IMAGE. OF A ONE OF

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:57.672
A PROJECTS THAT WE'VE DONE WITH

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.240
A SIMILAR TYPE OF THE SPACE YOU

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.609
CAN SEE HOW. THE CIRCULATION

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.012
AND IS BARCLAYS WILL BE ABLE TO

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:07.615
PROVIDE THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:08.216
THAT A SPACE AT EVERY LEVEL.

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.051
AND THEN HERE'S WHAT THAT MIGHT

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.120
LOOK LIKE IN THE CIRCLE- IS

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:13.788
ONLY A TWO STORY SPACE

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.657
CONNECTING THE GARDEN LEVEL

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.792
AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.727
EXECUTIVE FLOOR. SO IT'S MORE

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:21.696
OF A GALLERY TYPE SPACE PERHAPS

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:23.831
COULD BE USED FOR SOME EXHIBIT

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:26.434
SPACE. AND THEN IT'D BE CAPPED

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:27.935
WITH WHAT WE CALL A LADY LIKE

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:28.836
TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY A

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.805
SKYLIGHT THAT IS LOWER. THAN

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.640
THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. ALL

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:34.742
THE UPER FLOORS WILL BE A

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.111
LITTLE MORE INDEPENDENTLY SAY

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.813
FROM THIS PUBLIC SPACE DONE.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.516
AND DONE THE DOUBLE PHD.

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:43.484
LIKEWISE THE SQUARE IS- IT

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:46.287
ARRANGES SIMILAR NATURE JUST

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:48.589
THE JAVA TREES DIFFERENT. WITH

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:51.859
THAT I LIKE TO CALL BACK- CHLOE

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:52.360
TO GO THROUGH SOME ENTRY

01:28:52.427 --> 01:29:10.845
SEQUENCE.

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:12.313
SO YEAH WE'RE LOOKING

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.848
AT A CROSS SECTION OF THE

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.982
DOUBLE T. AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.050
TAKE YOU THROUGH AN ENTRY

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.752
SEQUENCE OF ALL THREE SCHEMES

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.687
STARTING WITH THE DOUBLE T. SO

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:20.988
YOU CAN SEE AS YOU ARRIVE ON

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:22.990
THE EAST YOU'RE GREETED WITH

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.692
VERY VISIBLE VIEWS OF THE DOME.

AND THIS IS BOTH FOR AWAY

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.464
FINDING TOOL BUT ALSO FOR HIS

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:30.064
STARK REVERENCE THROUGHOUT THE

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:32.500
BUILDING. THIS IS A VIEW JUST

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:33.968

ABOUT TO APPROACH THE PUBLIC

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.872
SPACE. AND HERE IS THE PUBLIC

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.373
SPACE YOU CAN SEE THIS AMPLE

THE DOME AND- THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.779
MENTIONED. THE SPACE IS

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:45.780
ACTIVATED ALL THE WAY UP SO

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.316
THIS. TRULY BECOMES THE

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:50.418
PEOPLE'S HOUSE. AND THEN THIS

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:52.453
IS A VIEW FROM ONE LEVEL UP.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.821
THIS IS- THE ENTRY TO THE

DOWN ON TO THE PUBLIC SPACE

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:00.795
LOOKING UP TO THE DOME AND

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.163
LOOKING DIRECTLY AHEAD IN FRONT

CIRCLE. AS YOU APPROACH THE

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.239
CIRCLE YOU SEE GLIMPSES OF THAT

01:30:11.305 --> 01:30:13.741
DOME. AND THEN THIS IS A VIEW

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.510
STRAIGHT OFF TO THE SECURITY

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.245
YOUR LEADS THROUGH A CORRIDOR

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:20.748
INTO THAT SECULAR PUBLIC SPACE.

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.216
IN THIS WE THINK COULD BE A

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.451
GREAT OPPORTUNITY A FLEXIBLE

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:26.120
SPACE PERHAPS FULL- TEMPORARY

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:28.089
OLE PERMANENT EXHIBITS FOR

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:33.161
GALLERY FULL FULL MOTIFS I'M-

INTO THE WEST WING. AND THEN

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:46.040
AGAIN VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:48.142
CIRCLE YOU SEE THE SQUARE THE

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:51.746
APPROACH FROM THE EAST. AS

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:52.380

LITTLE. MMHM. THIRTY TWO- PLAY

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.781
MUSICAL CHAIRS MIGHT WE THOUGHT

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:27.748
THAT IS SPEAKING THROUGH A

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:29.851
MASK- MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:32.453
THAT THAT DIFFICULT BECAUSE SO-

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.156
WILL HAVE I'M I'M GONNA TAKE

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.390
OVER NOW IN THAT BAG WALK YOU

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:39.427
THROUGH- GOING COUNTER TOP

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.195
THROUGH THE SITE AND- CHLOE

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.496
WILL BE SPINNING THE MODEL KIND

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:45.399
OF TRYING TO ORIENT YOU IF YOU

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.267
CAN SEE IT. AND THERE SO HERE'S

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.502
THE FIRST FEW. WE'RE LOOKING-

01:31:48.569 --> 01:31:52.206
FROM THE SOUTHWESTAPPLE TO THE

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:52.773
CAPITOL BUILDING AND YOU CAN

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.643
SEE THAT- BOTH THAT DOUBLE T.

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.612
IN THE CIRCLES TO RECEIVE BACK

01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:00.448
A LITTLE BIT TO IN AND BEHIND

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.049
THE CAPITAL MAKING IT. A LITTLE

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:03.784
BIT MORE PROMINENT WEARS A

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.519
SQUARE IS MORE OF A FLASH

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:08.222
CONDITION IN A LET IT ALIGNING

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.057
WITH THAT WITH THAT SOUTH AND

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:12.927
NORTH. FOR FIVE. IT IS A BIT

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:18.532
MORE- THEY SAY- IN PARALLEL

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:20.601
WITH THE CAPITAL. THIS IS A

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.603
VIEW NOT LOOKING IS STRAIGHT-

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:27.308
ISTA ON THE NEWLY. THE NEW- SO

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.176
PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY THAT WILL BE

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:31.779
RECONNECTING- THE CAPITOL

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:34.115
GROUNDS WITH THE PARK. A IN

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:36.317
HERE YOU CAN SEE ALSO THAT THAT

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.786
RESET RECEIVE THAT THAT. THAT

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:39.987
THE DOUBLE T. FOR EXAMPLE

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.188
RECEIVED BACK THERE IN THE

01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:43.324
MIDDLE A LITTLE BIT TO ALLOW

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.892
THE CAPITAL TO BE MORE

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.927
PROMINENT AND JUST AS

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:48.863
IMPORTANTLY GIVING US- TREES ON

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.165
THE SOUTH AND MAINLY THE NORTH

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:54.402
OPEN THE MOON TREE AND SO FORTH

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:57.338
A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM. AT WHAT

01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:00.541
THAT DOES IS IT. MAKES THE EAST

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:01.976
SIDE OF THAT BUILDING TO

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:04.478
PROTRUDE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

01:33:04.545 --> 01:33:06.580
SAY THAT THE LIMITS OF THE OF

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:09.951
THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF SOUTH OF

01:33:10.017 --> 01:33:11.385
THE CAPITAL. THE CIRCLES A

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.553
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.255
IT'S GEOMETRY IS VERY COMPACT

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:18.225
AND- WELL WE SEE IT FROM- FROM

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.894
FROM ABOVE AS IT LOOKS LIKE A

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.362
VERY BIG BUILDING BUT WHEN YOU

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.731
ARE AT EYE LEVEL. THE GEOMETRY

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.500
OF THE CIRCLE ALWAYS IS BY

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.469
GOING AWAY FROM YOU SO YOU

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:29.637
NEVER REALLY SEE THE ENTIRE

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:31.505
VOLUME OUT OF THE BUILDING

01:33:31.572 --> 01:33:33.007
BECAUSE ALWAYS PEELING AWAY

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:35.609
FROM YOU. SO THAT ALLOWS

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:37.745
NATURALLY BY GEOMETRY BE ABLE

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:40.147
TO PULL AWAY FROM. FROM THAT

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:41.782
FROM THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE IN

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:45.786
AND CREATE THE ROOM- FOR THE

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:48.522
TREES AS WELL. THE DOUBLE THAT

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:49.690
THE SQUARE IS A LITTLE BIT

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.125
DIFFERENT IN THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.660
OUTLINES WITH THAT NORTH AND

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.862
SOUTH FACADE FOR THE OF THE-

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:57.498
WEST WING. A. N. YOU KNOW

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:00.101
FEMALE MORE PROMINENT- FACADE-

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.802
YOU KNOW I AM COMPETING A

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.337
LITTLE BIT MORE WITH THE WEST

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:04.805
WING BUT STILL. ABLE TO BE

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:07.108
RESOLVED IN A IN A IN A GOOD

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.477
WAY. FOR THE TREES AND MAYBE A

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.212
LITTLE BIT OF MORE CHALLENGING

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.913
TO DEAL WITH THE MILITARY BUT

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.983
WE THINK- THAT WE CAN. WE CAN

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:19.453
STILL PRESENT A TREE. AND THEN

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.123
ALL THREE OF THE FACADES ALSO

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:25.860
REVEALED BACK THE- THE HISTORIC

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.828
FACADE OF THE SITE OF THE WEST

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:32.733
WING. AND THIS IS A VIEW A

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.036
LITTLE FURTHER EAST- FROM THE

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.871
SOUTHEAST LOOKING BACK AT THE

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:39.073
DOME AND YOU CAN SEE HOW. THAT

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.542
THE BUILDING THREE FEEDBACK- A

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:44.045
BIT ALLOW YOU TO STILL HAVE A

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:47.014
VERY GOOD VIEW TO THE DAHLE.

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.682
AND THAT IS WITH THE TREES SO

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:50.251
THE TREES ARE SOLD DANCE AROUND

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.153
THE SITE THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.055
THESE VIEWS ARE OBVIOUSLY. FROM

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:57.425
PICKING FROM AWAITING THE TREES

01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:57.992
THE TREES ARE VERY IMPORTANT

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:59.927
PIECE OF THE OF THE CONTEXT OF

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:02.930
ALL OF THIS PROJECT SO WE MUST

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:05.766
THAT BE BE REALLY REALLY.

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:06.367
CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:09.737
A- THIS IS A VIEW GOING UP-

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.107
THE- TWELVE STREET FROM ANOTHER

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:25.486
THAT. LOOKING OVER. WELL.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:36:00.754
SOMETHING. RIGHT. THERE IS.

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:14.201
SOMEWHERE THE CORRECT. HELLO

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:16.270
YEP NOT SMELL MUCH BETTER SO AS

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:18.038
I WAS SAYING THIS VIEW IS

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:21.075
LOOKING NORTH- I'VE- THAT TOLD

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:23.511
THE STREET RIGHT AWAY- ONE OF

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.346
THE DIFFERENCES IS THE CIRCLE-

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:27.348
IT PROTRUDES A LITTLE BIT OUT

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:29.783
INTO THIS RIGHT AT AREA YEAH

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:32.953
CREATING A PORCH- AN ENTRYWAY.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.390
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE DOUBLE

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:37.791
T. IN THE SQUARE WILL NEED TO

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:40.461
RELY ON A SMALLER CANOPY OR

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.730
SMALLER GESTURES TO BE ABLE TO-

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.298
THE NOTE THAT THAT ENTRY WAY

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.633
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

01:36:45.699 --> 01:36:48.936
WITH THE TREES SO THAT THE

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:50.437
BUILDING IS FAIRLY WELL THE

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:54.475
SCREEN WITH A LOT OF THE TREE.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:57.645
ANOTHER OF USES- LOOKING. AND

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:59.780
WE'VE ALL OF THE SCHEMES HAVE A

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:02.950
WHAT WE CALL AN INCISION OR A

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:03.517
GESTURE TO BE ABLE TO FRAME-

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:05.953
THE VIEW TO THE TO THE DAHLE.

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.556
AND THEN DENOTE AN IMPORTANT.

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:11.825
ONTO ON TO THE NEXT BUILDING.

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:14.495
HOWEVER IF WE LOOK FROM THE

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:15.829
VANTAGE POINT WHERE WE THIS

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.698
PERSPECTIVES WERE TAKEN THE

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.066
TREES ARE SO DENSE THAT YOU CAN

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:21.268
BARELY SEE IT. I'M SURE THAT AS

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:22.670
YOU WALK THROUGH THE PARK THERE

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:24.138
REMAIN INSTANCES THAT YOU CAN

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.307
SEE THROUGH THE TREES AND STILL

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:28.742
BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY'LL-

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:31.979
AND THEN LASTLY- THE VIEW-

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:35.082
LOOKING AT- FROM THE- I GUESS

01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.484
IS THE NORTHEAST. AT THE MOON

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.119
TREATS YOU CAN SEE IT THERE.

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:41.322
HOW THE DOUBLE T. AND YOU CAN

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:43.090
SEE IN THE PLANT THERE ON TOP-

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.992
THE RED THE RED LITTLE CIRCLE

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.694
THAT IS THE MOON TREE THAT IS

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.063
THE DREAM THAT. THE COMES THE

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:51.832
CLOSEST TO THE STRUCTURE-

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:52.900
DOUBLE T. AND THIS IN THE

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:55.869
CIRCLE ARE ABLE TO- STAY AWAY

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:57.204
FROM THAT TREE AND ABLE TO

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.139
PRESERVE REQUIRED QUITE A BIT.

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.875
WE THINK THAT THE SQUARE STOLE-

01:38:01.942 --> 01:38:03.744
ABLE TO DO THAT B. AS IT AS IT

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:05.613
IS IT WILL BE. ALMOST IN THE

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.114
SAME LOCATION AS THE EXISTING

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:10.317
ANNEXES BUT IT WE NEED TO HAVE

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:14.421
A LITTLE BIT MORE STUDY TO MAKE

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:14.989
SURE THAT THAT TREE COULD BE

01:38:15.055 --> 01:38:17.191
PREPARED. WITH THAT SCHEME. AND

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.926
THEN HERE'S A VIEW- WITH ALL

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:21.929
THE TREES TOGETHER SO- YEAH WE

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.798
ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO TRY

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:27.268
TO PRESERVE THE TREES OF MANY

01:38:27.334 --> 01:38:31.005
OF THEM. THAT WE CAN. FROM A

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.973
PERFORMANCE PERSPECTIVE- THIS

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.142
CAPITAL WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:40.180
A- HIGHEST ENERGY. PERFORMANCE

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:44.285
OF ANY CAPITAL IN THE NATION.

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:46.954
AND WE ALSO OF FOCUS A LITTLE

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:49.790
BIT ON THAT ASPECT OF WELLNESS

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:52.526
AND THE TOO TOP ROWS THERE ARE

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:55.062
ABOUT THE LIGHT AND GLARE WHICH

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:57.364
IS YOU KNOW. MANIFESTA SILVA

01:38:57.431 --> 01:39:00.834
HOW THE INHABITANTS IN THERE

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:02.536
WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.571
THE DAYLIGHT IN AND BE ABLE TO

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.407
DEAL WITH CARE THEREFORE AS THE

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.242
THOUGHT OF THE LOWER- I WROTE

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:12.546
THERE IS ABOUT- SOLAR RADIATION.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.516
AND I THINK THAT THE CIRCLE

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:16.450
PERFORMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:19.153
THAN THE OTHERS. EVEN THOUGH

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:19.687
THEY ALL A LOT HAVE A GOOD

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:25.125
PERFORMANCE. LASTLY WE HAVE-

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:27.795
WORKED THE PROGRAM IN ALL THREE

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:29.029
OF THESE CONCEPTS. IN ITS

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.532
TOTALITY FROM ON ALL THE FLOORS

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.600
AND WE THINK THAT THEY ARE

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:38.639
WORKING WELL AND THEY HAVE A-

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.774
GOOD FUNCTION FUNCTIONALITY AND

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:42.543
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SPACE

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.478
AND WE WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:46.647
WITH THE AUTHORIZED

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:47.981
REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE SURE

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:50.551
THAT THE SPACES ARE FUNCTIONING

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.119
FOR THAT. FOR YOU FOR THE

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:54.555
LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS FOR THE

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:57.891
EXECUTIVE. BRANCH HERE'S A

01:39:57.958 --> 01:40:02.763
CIRCLE. FAMOUS LAY OUT. AND

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.867
THEN THE SQUARE. AND THEN

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:09.837
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE WE'VE- FOUND

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:11.672
MANY COMMONALITIES AND WE SORT

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:13.774
OF GROUP THEM HERE- FOR YOUR

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.342
READING AND ALL THAT SOME OF

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:17.778
YOU HAVE- THE PACKET OR HALF

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:18.812
MAY HAVE RECEIVED THE PACKAGE

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:21.782
YESTERDAY. AND WE'VE SORT OF A

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.751
GROUP THEM IN TWO CATEGORIES

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:26.520
THE WORK WORKDAY PRODUCTIVITY

01:40:26.587 --> 01:40:29.456
WELL BEING AND THAT OF A PUBLIC

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:32.226
AND USER SUCH AS SAFETY AND

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:34.528
ACCESSIBILITY AND THEY ALL WE

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:38.132
THINK OUR GREAT IMPROVEMENT-

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:41.702
FROM FOR MORE SITTING HERE

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.137
TODAY ON. THE ALEX. WITHOUT

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:46.006
THAT WE BUY ONE FOCUS ON THE

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:49.543
MODEL AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT.

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.278
FOUR THOSE VIEWERS THAT ARE ON

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:52.846
THE INTERNET YOU MAY WANT TO

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.681
FOCUS THE CAMERA ON THE MODEL

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:57.284
NOW AND- YEAH IF WE COULD GET

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:59.186
THE TELEVISION ON THE MODEL AND

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.088
WHOEVER'S IN THE ROOM CAN CA.

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:02.389
SO WE LIKE TO USE THIS AS A

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.057
TOOL JUST TO REITERATE SOME OF

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:05.426
THE POINTS THAT WE WERE TALKING

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:06.026
ABOUT THAT THE THREE DIFFERENT

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:07.961
SCHEMES. SO YOU CAN SEE YEAH

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:10.264
THE DOUBLE T. HOW IT CINCHES IN

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.433
IN THE MIDDLE READY TO CREATE

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.368
READING ROOM FOR THE WEST WING.

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:15.702
AS WELL AS TO PROTECT AND

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:17.404
PRESERVE THE THREE FIVE ON THE

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.273
NORTH AND THE SOUTH. AND THEN

01:41:19.339 --> 01:41:22.376
YOU SEE HOW I'M THE REST OF

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:22.976
THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE IS PUT IN

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:25.379
THE BACK. AGAIN IN A PLACE WITH

01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:27.748
NO EXISTING TREES. AND YOU CAN

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.750
ALSO SEE HOW THE RHYTHM OF THE

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:31.118
DOUBLE T. THE FACADE RHYTHM

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:32.453
READY FAST. YOU LAKE THAT

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:34.755
RHYTHM. ON THE WEST WING. AND

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:37.591
I'M GOING TO VERY CAREFULLY

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:44.164
TAKE THIS ONE OUT. IT WAS. AND

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:53.106
THEN WE CAN PUT THE CIRCLE AND.

01:41:53.173 --> 01:41:53.674
AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT YOU

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.743
CAN SEE. WITH THE SEVERAL PM

01:41:56.810 --> 01:42:00.380
JUST BY VIRTUE OF ITS GEOMETRY.

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:03.450
THAT THE GEOMETRY NATURALIST

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:06.053
INCHES IN AROUND THE WEST WING.

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:06.854
GIVING THE WEST BRING A LOT OF

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.189
BREATHING ROOM AS WELL AS

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:11.658
TENSIONS IN TO THE EAST- AND WE

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:15.529
MENTIONED HOW THE CIRCLE RATES

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:17.965
THIS PORCH OVER THE TWELFTH

01:42:18.031 --> 01:42:18.899
STREET RIGHT OF WAY READY

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.568
CREATING A KIA ENTRANCE INTO

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.302
THE BUILDING. ANOTHER WE

01:42:22.369 --> 01:42:23.604
LOOKING AT THE MODEL NOW FROM

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.706
ABOVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:27.541
THIS AS A PEDESTRIAN FROM MY

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.376
LEVEL THE GEOMETRY READY IS

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:31.078
ALWAYS RECEDING AWAY FROM YOU

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:33.213
SO YOU NEVER QUITE EXPERIENCED.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.682
THE FULL THE FULL- THE VOLUME

01:42:35.749 --> 01:42:40.954
OF THE OF THE SCHEME. WE'RE

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:47.494
GOING TO TAKE THE FUN OUT. YOU

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:58.605
HAVE THAT. THEN WILL AND WITH

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:03.410
THE SWIFT GAME. THE DEFINITELY

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:04.478
THE DRAMA THREE OF THE WAY

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:07.281
POSSIBLY GEOMETRY THAT'S MORE

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:10.751
RECOGNIZABLE YOU CAN SEE HOW IT

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.519
ALSO CINCHES BACK A LITTLE LESS

01:43:12.586 --> 01:43:14.354
THAN THE OTHERS AT THAT THE

01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:16.223
OTHER SCHEMES SO REVEALING THE

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.992
EAST FACADE- AND REALLY IS IN

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:20.727
TUNE WITH THE GEOMETRY OF THE

01:43:20.794 --> 01:43:23.430
WEST WING HAS A LOT OF THE SAME

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:24.698
FEATURES. I'LL JUST SPEND THAT

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:32.339
AROUND. I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:35.042
REPORTING BY THE- ON

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:37.277
PRESENTATION MODE SO WE CAN

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:39.246
MOVE ON TO A- THIS THEIR

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:41.415
HEARTS- COMMENTS ON BUDGET AND

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:44.885
SCHEDULE. I'M GONNA TRY TO

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:49.856
ADVANCE THE SLIGHT BEFORE. HOW

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:57.297
DO I GET RID OF THE- WELL.

01:43:57.364 --> 01:44:05.238
TRANSACTION. ALL RIGHT THERE

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:27.394
YOU GO. BIGELOW DAVID.

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:37.804
FOR A

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:38.805
FORGET I WANT TO THANK THE

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:41.375
ASSEMBLY STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:44.144
DONE TO KEEP THINGS- CLEAN I'VE

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:46.813
I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:47.381
EFFORT I'M SURE HE DIDN'T

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:49.683
INTEND TO JUMP UP AND DOWN SO

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:50.951
MUCH AS HE HAS BUT WE REALLY

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:52.819
APPRECIATE HIM TAKING CARE OF

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:54.187
THAT I WANT TO TALK FOR A

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.455
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BUDGET AND

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:57.424
SCHEDULE AND THE MANAGEMENT

01:44:57.491 --> 01:44:59.826
STRATEGY THAT WE'RE WE'RE USING

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:03.363
FOR THE- ANNEX BUILDING- FIRST

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.598
OF ALL BEFORE I START AGAIN I

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:07.200
WANT TO RE AND- REINFORCED THE

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:08.068
FACT THAT THESE ARE CONCEPTUAL

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.469
DRAWINGS. WE STILL HAVE A LONG

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.638
WAYS TO GO THEY LOOK WONDERFUL

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:13.573
I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.609
OVER YOU KNOW THE OVERTIME AS

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:17.778
HE EVOLVED TO WHERE THESE LOOK

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:19.613
LIKE THEY'RE FINISHED DRAWINGS

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.447
BUT I DON'T WANT TO FOOL YOU

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:22.015
HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO AND WE

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:23.350
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:24.851
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO

01:45:24.918 --> 01:45:27.721
STILL TRY TO BRING THINGS TO

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:30.357
TOGETHER- I WAS ASKED TO TALK A

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.491
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:34.428
THAT WE'RE USING- IN- MANAGING

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.762
THE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE IN THE

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.764
AND THE PROJECT OVERALL. WE'VE

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.067
DEVELOPED A PROCESS- UTILIZE

01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:41.868
OVER THE LAST- FOR CAPITAL SO

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.336
WE VIEWS CALLED EARLY PROJECT

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:45.305
DEFINITION AN ALIGNMENT WHICH

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:47.040
IS WHAT THE THAT GENERALLY DOES

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:48.642
ARE BASICALLY DOES IS IT TRIES

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.577
TO TAKE THE EXPECTATIONS THAT

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:54.414
YOU THE- OWNER HAS AND ALIGN

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:55.716
THAT WITH THE BUDGET AND

01:45:55.782 --> 01:46:00.320
SCHEDULE AND QUALITY THAT. YOU

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:00.887
WANT FOR YOUR YOUR BILL IN

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:02.856
DOING THE- WELL WE DO IS IF YOU

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:04.224
LOOK AT THE CHART THAT IS-

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:07.394
DISPLAYED. A BLACK LINE THAT IS

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:07.961
RUNNING THROUGH THERE IS THE

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:10.564
TRADITIONAL. SHOW THAT ON THE

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:29.249
SCREEN.

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:34.788
OOPS YEAH SUCH SHOWING

01:46:34.855 --> 01:46:37.190
UP SO THE BLACK LINE THAT YOU

01:46:37.257 --> 01:46:39.459
SEE ON THE IN THE GRAPH THERE

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:41.528
ON THE RIGHT IS THE TRADITIONAL

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.463
DESIGN PROCESS AND WHAT WE TRY

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:45.932
TO DO IS WE TRY TO MOVE THAT TO

01:46:45.999 --> 01:46:47.801
THE LEFT WHICH IS WHERE THE RED

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:49.269
LINE IS SHOWING AND WHAT THAT

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:50.904
DOES IS IT PLACES IT UNDER THE

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:54.007
BLUE CURVE AND- THAT BLUE CURVE

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.909
IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE

01:46:55.976 --> 01:46:58.278
OF THE PROJECT AND EARLY IN THE

01:46:58.345 --> 01:47:00.514
PROJECT THE MORE WE CAN DO

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.283
EARLY ON THE LESTICUS COSTS US

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.718
WITH THE MORE INFLUENCE WE HAVE

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:06.319
BECAUSE LESS DECISIOS HAVE

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.221
BEEN MADE. SO THE MORE THINGS

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:09.489
WE CAN DO UP FRONT THE MORE

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:11.792
WORK WE CAN PUT INTO IT UP

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:12.893
FRONT THE MORE WE CAN IMPACT

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:14.761
THE COST THE QUALITY IN THE

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:16.863
SCHEDULE IN A POSITIVE WAY IF

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:19.199
WE WAIT AND ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.001
IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE AND WE

01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:22.068
ALLOW FOR THOSE DECISIONS TO BE

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:24.871
MADE AFTER THOSE TWO LINES THE

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:25.405
RED IN THE BLUE LINE HAVE

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:27.174
INTERSECTED THEN ALL OF A

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.875
SUDDEN THAT COST OF THE CHANGE

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:30.844
BECOMES MUCH HIGHER AND YOU

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.379
START TO SEE CHANGE ORDERS AND

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:34.314
YOU START TO SEE PROBLEMS. FOR

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.950
THE LAST FOUR CAPITALS UTAH-

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:39.619
IDAHO MINNESOTA AND WYOMING WE

01:47:39.686 --> 01:47:41.021
HAVE USED THIS PROCESS FOR

01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:42.088
MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM REVIEWS

01:47:42.155 --> 01:47:43.924
THIS PROCESS TO HELP DELIVER

01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:45.926
THOSE PROJECTS ON BUDGET AND

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:47.494
THAT IS THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:49.362
USING TO HELP MANAGE YOUR

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:51.331
PROJECT AND SO TO GIVE YOU A

01:47:51.398 --> 01:47:52.933
LITTLE BIT OF- OUR MANAGEMENT

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:57.571
STRATEGY- MR COOLEY- THE-

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.439
CHAIRMAN COOLEY HAD- HAD YOU

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:01.241
PUT TOGETHER A PLANNING STUDY

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.343
WHICH WAS PERFECT IN TWO

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.212
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WHICH-

01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:07.447
IS THE BLUE BOOK SHOWN HERE-

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:09.182
THAT IDENTIFIED THE

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:10.517
DEFICIENCIES THAT THE CURRENT

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:13.386
ANNEX HAS. IDENTIFIED THAT MATT

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:15.088
WAS- THAT DRAFT WAS COMPLETED

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.923
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND

01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:18.058
THAT WAS A VERY HELPFUL DRAFT

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.593
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED US TO START

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:20.827
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROBLEMS

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.596
WERE WITH THE BUILDING SO WE

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:24.431
COULD EVALUATE THOSE AND MAKE

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:28.034
THE DECISION AS TO HOW TO MOVE.

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.002
MOVE FORWARD. YOU RECEIVED BACK

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:32.405
IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:33.473
NINETEEN THE POS THE PROJECT

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.242
OVERVIEW IN SEQUENCE REPORT.

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:36.376
THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WHICH

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:37.777
BASICALLY IDENTIFIED THE

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:40.747
QUALITY COST SCHEDULE. AND

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:42.916
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:44.317
IDENTIFIED HOW WE WOULD DO THAT

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:45.185
IN A PUT TOGETHER CLEAR

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:47.854
PRINCIPLES AND- GUIDELINES TO

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:49.756
HELP. THE ARCHITECTS AND THE

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.391
ENGINEERS AND THE CONTRACTORS

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:53.360
MOVE THOSE THINGS FORWARD. AND

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.095
THAT DRAFT AS I MENTIONED WAS

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:59.099
COMPLETED IN AUGUST OF TWO

01:48:59.165 --> 01:48:59.733
THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE HAVE OVER

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:01.701
THE LAST- I WOULD SAY FOUR

01:49:01.768 --> 01:49:03.003
MONTHS FIVE MONTHS DURING THE

01:49:03.069 --> 01:49:05.405
SCOLDED PERIOD WE HAVE HELD

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:07.807
EIGHT DIFFERENT WORKSHOPS- WITH

01:49:07.874 --> 01:49:10.076
THE DESIGN TEAM AND PRIOR TO

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.945
THAT WE HELD FOR FIVE DIFFERENT

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:15.181
WORKSHOPS WITH THE- VISITOR

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:17.284
CENTER TEAM- WE HAVE ONE

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.652
WORKSHOP LEFT TO DO WHICH IS A

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.820
COST RECONCILIATION WORKSHOP

01:49:20.887 --> 01:49:22.289
FOR THE ONYX WHICH- WE CAN'T

01:49:22.355 --> 01:49:24.190
REALLY DO UNTIL WE GET DOWN TO

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:25.592
ONE SCHEME BECAUSE IT TENDS TO

01:49:25.659 --> 01:49:27.527
BE A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF

01:49:27.594 --> 01:49:28.762
WORK THAT HAS TO GO INTO THAT.

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:30.964
THAT RETIREES RESULT AND SELL

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.933
THOSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH-

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:34.868
THOSE WORKSHOPS. AND THEN WITH

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:36.836
REGARDS TO MANAGING THE BUDGET-

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:39.105
WE USE CONTINGENCY IN THE

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:40.907
BUDGET DEVELOPMENT TO HELP

01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:43.510
MANAGE THE RISK THAT WE KNOW IS

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:44.644
THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.313
EVERYTHING AT THIS POINT. AND

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:48.148
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN CONCEPT

01:49:48.214 --> 01:49:50.317
DESIGN WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE WE

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:51.017
TRY TO HAVE A LOT OF

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:52.953
CONTINGENCY. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.688
CARRYING ABOUT 20% OF THE

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:56.690
BUDGET OR ONE FIFTH OF THE

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.625
BUDGET TO ONE QUARTER OF THE

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:00.527
BUDGET IS IN CONTINGENCY RIGHT

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:03.229
NOW. UP FOR EXAMPLE ON SOME OF

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:04.197
THESE GAMES THERE'S A LITTLE

01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:05.231
MORE CONTINGENCY BECAUSE

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.067
THERE'S A LITTLE LESS KNOWN-

01:50:07.133 --> 01:50:08.868
AND THERE'S- ON OTHERS A LITTLE

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:12.172
LESS BUT IT'S ALL BETWEEN

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:13.173
TWENTY AND 24% SCHEMATIC DESIGN

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:14.240
WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:16.476
NEXT WITH ONE SCHEME. WE WILL

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:17.777
WORK TO BRING THAT CONTINGENCY

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:19.779
DOWN TO ABOUT 15% AND THEN IN

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:21.514
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:22.816
WHERE WE REALLY GET INTO THE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:23.783
NUTS AND BOLTS OF HOW THE

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:24.884
BUILDING GOES TOGETHER AND HOW

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.087
THINGS. ARE LEARNED. WE WILL

01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.355
MAIN WE'LL GET DOWN TO ABOUT

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:30.590
10% CONTINGENCY EACH TIME WE DO

01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:32.993
THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:34.694
SOME AND MOVE SOME IN TO THE

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:36.663
DESIGN THEREBY HELPING TO

01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:39.332
REDUCE THE OVERALL BUDGET- AND

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.401
WE INTEND THEM TO SIGN THE GMP

01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:42.936
AND GO INTO CONSTRUCTION WITH

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.504
ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN. PERCENT

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:47.173
CONTINGENCY. SO WHERE ARE WE

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.042
CURRENTLY WITH THE ESTIMATE. IF

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:50.577
YOU TAKE ANY ONE OF THESE.

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:53.613
SCHEMES WE ARE BETWEEN ABOUT

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.448
FIVE AND 10% IN THE AGGREGATE-

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.816
THE ON THE BUDGET BEYOND THE

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:58.651
POS BUDGET. WHICH IS NOT

01:50:58.718 --> 01:51:00.487
UNUSUAL FOR THE STATE BECAUSE

01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:02.022
AGAIN REMEMBER THIS A LOT WE

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:03.923
STILL DON'T KNOW AND THERE'S A

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.824
LOT THAT WE STILL HAVE TO

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:07.093
DISCOVER. THE CONTINGENCY THAT

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.995
WE'RE CARRYING IS BETWEEN

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:11.297
TWENTY AND 24% SO YOU CAN SEE

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:11.898
THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:13.900
ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY. AND

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:16.870
15% WITH REGARDS TO- HOW MUCH

01:51:16.936 --> 01:51:20.573
CONTINGENCY OVER THE OVER THE-

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:21.941
OVERREACH THAT WE CURRENTLY

01:51:22.008 --> 01:51:23.977
HAVE. WE ARE FAIRLY WE ARE VERY

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:25.745
CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.680
REDUCE THAT AND GET THE PROJECT

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:29.082
DOWN TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE.

01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:32.419
AND AGAIN WE ARE USING THAT

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:33.019
CONTINGENCY AND WE'VE USED IN

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.587
THE PAST TO MATCH. THE SO THAT

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:36.489
WE ACTUALLY PUT MORE IN AT THIS

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:38.324
STAGE BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAT

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.460
WE UNDERSTAND. SO IT IS

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:42.162
ANTICIPATED THAT AS WE MOVE

01:51:42.228 --> 01:51:43.696
FORWARD THAT CONTINGENCY WILL

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:45.331
BE ABSORBED INTO THE PROJECT OR

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:47.167
ELIMINATED ALL TOGETHER. AND

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:49.903
WHEN WE GO INTO CONSTRUCTION

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:51.237
WILL BE DOWN TO ABOUT 5% WHAT

01:51:51.304 --> 01:51:53.106
I'D LIKE TO DO NOW. IS TO TURN

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.174
THE TIME OVER TO TELL YOU TO

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.408
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:51:55.475 --> 01:51:57.310
SCHEDULE AND THE MILESTONES.

01:51:57.377 --> 01:52:17.363
THEN I'LL COME BACK IN AND WRAP.

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:21.000
GOOD AFTERNOON ALL HERE WE HAVE

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.535
A FIVE YEAR LOOK AHEAD SPANNING

01:52:22.602 --> 01:52:23.770
THE DURATION OF THE VISITOR

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.271
CENTER WEST WING AND ANNEXED

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:27.507
PROJECTS- I WILL GO INTO

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:28.808
FURTHER DETAIL OF ALL THE

01:52:28.875 --> 01:52:30.343
MILESTONES ON THE NEXT SLIDE

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:31.644
HOWEVER IT IS OF NOTE THAT THE

01:52:31.711 --> 01:52:32.946
VISITOR CENTER AND THE NEW

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:35.381
ANNEXED PROJECTS WILL BE PHASED

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:37.951
DESIGN PROJECTS MEANING THAT-

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:39.752
DO YOU DESIGN AND PERMITTING

COLLAPSING. JOBS ARE BEING LOST.

02:05:26.051 --> 02:05:28.554
FALL IN A WAY THE SURPLUS IS A

02:05:28.621 --> 02:05:32.491

GOVERNOR SAID LET'S KEEP A

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:41.967
CHECK ON OUR SPENDING. THIS IS

02:05:42.034 --> 02:05:43.936
HIS JOB AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:45.838
SO FOR THIS REASON THE VISITOR

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:48.307
CENTER WHICH WHILE IT PLAYS AT

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:50.476
INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE STRATEGY

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.378
TO GET RID OF BOTTLENECKS AND

02:05:52.444 --> 02:05:56.916
CONGESTION. OF AND OVERCROWDING.

02:05:56.982 --> 02:06:00.219
IS SORT OF A PLUS ELEMENT. TO

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:02.087
THE LARGER ENERGY PROJECTS OF

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:03.589
ASHLEY PUT ON PAUSE SO I JUST

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:06.458
WANNA SAY I ACTUALLY FAVOR THAT

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:08.594
BUT I THINK THAT'S A- IF. IT'S

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:12.464
UNDER THE LAW. THE JOINT RULES

02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:13.465
COMMITTEE IS TO HAVE THE

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.434
PREEMINENT ROLE IN DECISIONS

02:06:15.501 --> 02:06:17.036
ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT'S

02:06:17.102 --> 02:06:19.305
ACTUALLY WORE TO DISTRACTION

02:06:19.371 --> 02:06:22.341
PREEMINENT. THAT BEING THE CASE

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:24.743
IT DOES SAY ANNEX PARKING

02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:27.212
GARAGE RESERVE CENTER. BUT IT

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:29.882
SAYS TIMING COULD VERY SO I

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.283
SORT OF FEEL IF IT IS THE VIEW

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.718
OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE AS

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:35.354

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:39.124
QUORUM. AND HAVE A SETTLED VIEW.

02:06:39.191 --> 02:06:40.659
DID WITH SERVICE CENTER I

02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:42.328
BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:44.430
TO ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNOR

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:48.767
CONVERSATION. BECAUSE OF WE ARE

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:49.335
PARTNERS WITH THE EXECUTIVE

02:06:49.401 --> 02:06:52.171

RESPECT ALL OUR PARTNERS SO I

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.621

02:09:35.534 --> 02:09:38.103
THE- FUNDS FOR THE ENTIRE

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:40.639
PROJECT. THE APPROPRIATIONS OR

02:09:40.706 --> 02:09:42.574
PASSED IN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:44.309
FUNDED THE ENTIRE PROJECT. IN

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:47.346
THE DOWNTURN THE REQUEST WAS

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:49.348
CAN A EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVE

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:52.217
ACCESS TO THAT CASH. WHICH I

02:09:52.284 --> 02:09:55.420
SAID YES. CAN WE PUT THE

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:57.055
VISCERAL PAUSE THAT SEEMED

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:59.158
REASONABLE AGAIN THIS IS THE

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:02.427
MIDDLE OF MARCH AND I'M ON THE

02:10:02.494 --> 02:10:02.961
FOR THE GOVERNORS FINANCE

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:05.531
DIRECTOR- BUT THE CONVERSATION

02:10:05.597 --> 02:10:08.133
AS WELL. WE DO HAVE PLANNING

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.635
DESIGN WORK IN A WAY WE CAN OF

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.370
COURSE CONTINUE THAT. BECAUSE

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.005
IT'S AN ELEMENT OF THE

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:14.640
LEGISLATURE'S STATE FOR A

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:18.443
STORY- NINETY ONE TWELVE. ANNEX

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:21.146
PARKING GARAGES OR CENTER. AND

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.981
THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:25.384
PLANNING CONTINUING. SO I DO

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.286
FEEL AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WE

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:30.522
JUST. WE DO NEED TO WORK WITH

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:34.660
THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGREEMENT

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:35.294
TO FUND THE VISITOR CENTER THAT

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:38.263
IT'S- CLAIRE WE ALREADY HAVE

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:40.632
AUTHORITY UNDER STATUTE ENACTED

02:10:40.699 --> 02:10:44.937
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT. WE

02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.872
CAN USE LEASE REVENUE BONDS FOR

02:10:46.939 --> 02:10:50.042
THE PROJECT. AND AT THE FORTY

02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:53.745
IS ALSO IN PLACE SO WE

02:10:53.812 --> 02:10:56.048
SUPPORTED OUR STATE IN

02:10:56.114 --> 02:10:56.949
RESPONDING TO A STATE OF

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:59.384
EMERGENCY WE HAVE THESE REVENUE

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:02.221
BONTA FORTY AVAILABLE THAT'S

02:11:02.287 --> 02:11:04.323
ALSO WHEN THE MAYES. BUDGET

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:08.493
REVISE NO- BUT I YEAH I MEAN I

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.930
FEEL IT'S- BY LAW JOINT RULES

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:14.032
HAS THE STATE FOR A FORTY ITS

02:11:14.099 --> 02:11:16.501
HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THE ANNEX

02:11:16.568 --> 02:11:18.303
THE WEST WING WAS A LEGISLATIVE

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:21.473
PROJECT. THE LAW REFLECTS THAT

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:24.243
I THINK IT'S FAIR FOR THE

02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:27.279
MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. TO

02:11:27.346 --> 02:11:28.580
CONSIDER WHERE THEY FEEL WE

02:11:28.647 --> 02:11:30.949
OUGHT TO BE GOING AND IF WE

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:32.818
FAVOR MOVING FORWARD AS

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.253
AGGRESSIVE AS YOU CAN WITH THE

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:35.587
VISITOR CENTER AND IT IS A

02:11:35.654 --> 02:11:37.456
CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:39.258
ALONG THOSE LINES I THINK

02:11:39.324 --> 02:11:41.093
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HELPFUL

02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:44.029
FROM THE MANAGEMENT TEAM. MIGHT

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:49.001
BE. SOME COST PROJECTIONS OF.

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:51.837
DOING VISITORS CENTER THIS.

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:52.571
ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:55.340
SCHEDULE VERSUS A DELAY IN

02:11:55.407 --> 02:11:58.277
POTENTIAL COST INCREASES THAT

02:11:58.343 --> 02:12:00.479
MIGHT. FURTHER INFORMED

02:12:00.545 --> 02:12:01.179
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.515
LEGISLATURE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S

02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:05.651
OFFICE THEN IF I COULD MOVE TO

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:06.818
A QUICK QUESTION MISTER CHAIR

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:09.054
JUST ON THE THREE DESIGN

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:12.090
CHOICES ON THE ANNEX- ON THE

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:16.194
CIRCLE DESIGN- IN TERMS OF

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:20.966
CONFIGURATION OF OFFICE SPACE-

02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:21.533
ARE THERE ANY ISSUES. OF THE

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.269
RAM ONE FOR FURNITURE AND- ARE

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:26.371
THE COSTS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT OF

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:28.740
THE THREE OPTIONS AND- DO ANY

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.575
OF THE OPTIONS HAVE UNIQUE.

02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:34.513
SPATIAL COST ISSUES THANK YOU

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:37.015
MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SENATOR

02:12:37.082 --> 02:12:40.552
MONNING. THEY ALL HAVE A LITTLE

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:43.288
DIFFERENT- COST IMPLICATIONS

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:45.691
FOR EXAMPLE THE DOUBLE T. HAS A

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:47.726
VERY LARGE ATRIUM SO WE'RE

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.394
PAYING FOR THAT ATRIUM THE

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:51.096
VENTILATION AND THE SMOKE

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:53.665
EVACUATION SYSTEM IN THE ROUND

02:12:53.732 --> 02:12:56.335
SCHEME- IT IS ONLY A TWO STORY

02:12:56.401 --> 02:12:57.769
SPACE SO IT'S TECHNICALLY NOT

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:59.671
AN ATRIUM THEREFORE NO WE'RE

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:00.305
NOT PAYING FOR AN ATRIUM

02:13:00.372 --> 02:13:03.208
EVACUATION SITUATION. HOWEVER

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.177
THE ROUND SCHEME DOES POSE

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:08.480
CERTAIN- COMPLEXITIES WITH

02:13:08.547 --> 02:13:10.916
REGARDS TO CONNECTIONS AND-

02:13:10.982 --> 02:13:12.951
WITH REGARDS TO HOW YOU TAKE

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:16.822
FLAT MATERIALS AND ENDITEM AND

02:13:16.888 --> 02:13:17.389
TO CURB MATERIAL SO YOU YOU

02:13:17.456 --> 02:13:17.956
YOU'RE ASKING AN EXCELLENT

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.558
QUESTION WE ARE ACTUALLY

02:13:19.624 --> 02:13:22.728
CARRYING ABOUT TWENTY FOUR

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:25.197
POINT 5% CONTINGENCY ON THE

02:13:25.263 --> 02:13:27.032
ROUND SCHEMES OR CARRYING MORE

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:31.336
CONTINGENCY THERE. BECAUSE

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:31.937
THERE IS MORE ON THE- AND SO

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:32.504
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:34.606
THOSE THINGS AS WE TALKED ABOUT

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:35.774
WITH REGARDS TO THAT

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:37.642
CONTINGENCY IN AS WE LEARN MORE

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:38.944
WE'LL- MOVE THAT HOPEFULLY

02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.012
NUMBER DOWN THANK YOU IN. FOR A

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:44.116
YIELD BACK TO THE CHAIR JUST A

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:44.649
FINAL COMMENT ON THE THREE

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:48.787
DESIGNS. THE IS IT THE DOUBLE

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.522
T. THAT HAS THE FORCE. FOR

02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:54.559
FLOOR ATRIUM. SO JUST A THOUGHT

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:55.694
FROM A CONCERT THE SECURITY

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:59.331
POINT OF VIEW. THE PUBLIC AREA

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:03.301
AS IT FILLS UP IF THERE ARE.

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:05.604
PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS PEOPLE

02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:08.807
EXERCISING PEACEFUL FIRST

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:12.177
AMENDMENT RIGHTS THERE COULD BE

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:14.513
A PREFERENCE TO HAVING UPPER

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:18.016
FLOORS SEALED OFF FROM THAT

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:21.086
PARTICIPATORY- SHOULD GAUGE

02:14:21.153 --> 02:14:23.655
MEANT IF YOU WILL- SO I THINK

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:26.124
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:28.894
THERE IT'S- RIGHT SPACES OPEN

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.929
FOR TWO FLOORS VERSUS FOR

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:33.465
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES- SO

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:34.666
THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS THANK YOU

02:14:34.733 --> 02:14:37.869

MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:51.283
THE INCREDIBLE PRESENTATION

02:14:51.349 --> 02:14:53.151
TODAY SENATOR MONNING HAD

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:54.252
TOUCHED UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.121
THAT I WANT TO RAISE AS WELL- I

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:57.823
BELIEVE IT'S MEXICO CITY'S

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:58.690
CONGRESS THAT'S DESIGNED IN THE

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:01.460
CIRCULAR WAY. OUT WHEN I WENT

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:02.828
TO GO VISIT IT JUST FELT LIKE

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:04.963
IT TOOK A REALLY LONG TIME TO

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:07.466
GET TO THE OFFICE. AND I'M JUST

02:15:07.532 --> 02:15:09.835
WONDERING THE WALKABILITY OF

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:11.369
EACH DESIGN AND WHICH WHICH

02:15:11.436 --> 02:15:14.105
DESIGN I PREFER MY PREFERENCES

02:15:14.172 --> 02:15:15.607
THAT THE CIRCULAR ONE-

02:15:15.674 --> 02:15:17.275
PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT HELPS SAVE

02:15:17.342 --> 02:15:19.144
THE MOST TREES. WHICH IS I

02:15:19.211 --> 02:15:20.612
THINK A AN IMPORTANT PART OF

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:23.014
THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE- AND SO

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:24.015
I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S ANY

02:15:24.082 --> 02:15:27.586
DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE

02:15:27.652 --> 02:15:28.220
WALKABILITY- AS YOU KNOW STAFF

02:15:28.286 --> 02:15:30.856
RUNS AROUND AND- AND WE ALL DO

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:31.456
RUNNING FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE

02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:33.592
TRYING TO DO OUR OUR JOBS ON A

02:15:33.658 --> 02:15:35.126
DAILY BASIS AND JUST WHAT THE

02:15:35.193 --> 02:15:37.429
<u>&lt;c.red&gt;MPACT EACH OF THOSE. THOSE ARE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.264
SIGNS ARE. SURE THANK YOU FOR

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:42.400
THE QUESTION. THE WE HAVEN'T I

02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:43.935
HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH AND HAVE

02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:45.570
THE ARCHITECTS FIGURE OUT THE

02:15:45.637 --> 02:15:48.206
AMOUNT OF LINEAL DISTANCE ON

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:49.508
ANY OF THE SCHEMES YOU HAVEN'T

02:15:49.574 --> 02:15:51.009
DONE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:53.278
NOT YET SO I DON'T KNOW THE

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:55.046
ANSWER SPECIFICALLY BUT WE HAVE

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:59.217
CREATED A SERIES OF- CROSS

02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:00.452
CORRIDOR IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:01.586
DESIGN AS WELL SO YOU HAVE THE

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:05.023
CIRCULAR 8EME

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:05.590
ABILITY TO WALK ALL THE WAY

02:16:05.657 --> 02:16:06.958
AROUND THE BUILDING. BUT WITHIN

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:07.826
THAT CIRCULATION WE HAVE

02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:09.594
CIRCULATION AND IS HAPPENING ON

02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:10.428
TWO SIDES SO YOU CAN CROSS

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:13.131
THROUGH AND GO BACK. SO IF YOU

02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:15.133
WANT TO WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND

02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.536
THE PERIMETER OR THE INTERIOR

02:16:17.602 --> 02:16:19.905
IT PROBABLY ISN'T- UP MAYBE A

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.206
LITTLE MORE BECAUSE OF THE

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.774
CIRCULAR NATURE THAN MAYBE THE

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:25.176
DOUBLE T. BUTTON THE DOUBLE T.

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:28.480
ALSO HAS A CIRCULATION OF GOES

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:29.080
DOWN EITHER SIDE AND THEN HAS

02:16:29.147 --> 02:16:30.148
WINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:32.951
UP INTO. AND SO LIKE MY GUESS

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:35.487
IS THE CIRCULATION IS PROBABLY-

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:39.858
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:41.026
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE MORE-

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:42.994
HIDDEN IN IN THE DOUBLE T. THE

02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:44.262
OTHER THING THAT I WILL TELL

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.931
YOU IS THAT- ONE OF THE

02:16:45.997 --> 02:16:47.532
CHALLENGES THAT WE GAVE TO THE

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:50.235
ARCHITECTS. IS THIS CONCEPT OF

02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:52.704
ADJACENCY TO EVERYTHING TRYING

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:54.472
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:55.941
ABILITY TO GET FROM POINT A TO

02:16:56.007 --> 02:16:58.176
POINT B. QUICKLY AND SO THAT'S

02:16:58.243 --> 02:16:59.411
WHY A LOT OF THESE CROSS

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:02.581
CONNECTIONS OCCUR WITHIN THE

02:17:02.647 --> 02:17:05.517
WHAT WHAT WE TO THE SIR OF THE

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:07.686
FIGURE A- SO THAT IF YOU ARE IN

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.120
THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE AND

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:10.055
YOU NEED TO GO ONE WAY OR THE

02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:11.556
OTHER YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO

02:17:11.623 --> 02:17:12.657
MOVE OR IF YOU NEED TO GO

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:13.792
ACROSS TO DOUBLE CROSSED

02:17:13.858 --> 02:17:15.794
WITHOUT HAVING TO WALK AROUND.

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:16.995
SO WE TRY TO MAKE IT AS

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:18.730
CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE BUT I DO

02:17:18.797 --> 02:17:20.231
THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:23.835
INHERENT ADDITIONAL.

JUST VERY COLORFUL CHART. AND

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:37.816
THE UPSHOT OF THIS CHART IS

02:17:37.882 --> 02:17:39.851
THAT WHAT IS QUITE UNIQUE IN

02:17:39.918 --> 02:17:42.320
OUR STATE CAPITOL IS THIS IDEA

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:44.155
WE HEARD REFERRED TO THE

02:17:44.222 --> 02:17:45.757
ADJACENCY OF EVERYTHING. A

LET'S SAY COUNCIL GET TO THE

02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.438
CAUCUS ROOM. THERE IS JUST

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:02.173
EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO GET

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.408
ALL AROUND THE BILL INTO ALL

02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:05.877

ONE. HAS LOOKED AT THE

02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:21.092
IMPORTANCE OF NOT LOSING THIS

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:23.194
QUALITY OF OUR CAPITAL. OF

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:25.930
EVERYTHING WITHIN EASY REACH.

02:18:25.997 --> 02:18:27.298

THINKING ABOUT THAT. ALL THESE

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:41.146
QUARTERS RESIGNED TO PROVIDE

02:18:41.212 --> 02:18:43.648

KEY THINGS THAT MAKES

02:18:53.158 --> 02:18:54.793
CALIFORNIA'S CAP ON UNIQUE.

02:18:54.859 --> 02:18:56.461
MANY OTHER CAPITALS IT'S MUCH

02:18:56.528 --> 02:18:58.830
MORE SPRAWLING OF THE WHOLE DC

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:00.999
EXPERIENCE- BUT MANY OTHER

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:02.634

02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:14.446
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IT CONCERNS

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:20.685
EXISTED FROM IN THIS BOOK. ON.

02:19:20.752 --> 02:19:22.554
GIVEN THE LONG HISTORY SECONDS

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.923
A PLACE OF HUMAN HABITATION.

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:25.356
THERE IS A VERY REAL

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:27.859

PRESENT ON THE GROUNDS. AND

02:19:32.263 --> 02:19:34.499
THERE'S A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.534
MAKING SURE WE ARE CAREFUL WITH

02:19:36.601 --> 02:19:40.004
THE FACT TO TRIBAL ROLEX OR

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.673
OTHER EVIDENCES ANYWAY THIS

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:44.709
POINT WE'VE HAD FORENSIC DOGS

02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:45.577

PENETRATING RADAR TO HELP US

02:19:53.017 --> 02:19:55.353
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BELOW GRADE

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:59.958
WITH THIS IN MIND- I SAY THAT

02:20:00.024 --> 02:20:03.628
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE IS.

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:05.263
IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:08.399
SENSITIVITY AND I PERSONALLY

02:20:08.466 --> 02:20:10.969

JOINT RULES IS UP TO SPEED- BUT

02:20:20.612 --> 02:20:22.714
THIS HAS BEEN A CONCERN FROM

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:24.149
DAY ONE AS IT WAS SAID THE

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:25.617

QUICK I'M IN A DIFFICULT

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:03.588
ECONOMIC CYCLE IT IT IS IT IS A

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:06.357
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE-

02:21:06.424 --> 02:21:06.958
CONSTITUENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY

02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:09.694
YOU'RE- BUILDING SOMETHING

02:21:09.761 --> 02:21:12.163
WHEN. EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:13.698
FURLOUGHS AND YOU'RE MAKING

CONSTITUENTS THAT FUNDING HAS

02:21:21.339 --> 02:21:22.941
BEEN APPROPRIATED THIS IS NOT

ALREADY SAID BONDS ASIDE TO DO

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:30.682
THIS. AND THAT IT ACTUALLY

02:21:30.748 --> 02:21:33.985
WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND-

02:21:34.052 --> 02:21:37.488
IN A GREAT ECONOMIC VITALITY-

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:41.059
WE BUILT TERMINAL C. AT JOHN

02:21:41.125 --> 02:21:41.626
WAYNE AIRPORT ORANGE COUNTY

02:21:41.693 --> 02:21:43.995
DURING THE GREAT RECSSION. AND

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:44.596
WHEN I WOULD TOURED EVERY SIX

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:47.165
WEEKS. THE WORKERS RED BANK ME

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:49.300
THAT THEY WERE WORKING THEY HAD

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:50.835

COMMUNICATE THIS AND THAT

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:59.310
WHAT'S THE GOVERNOR THINKING

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:00.712
AND IF THE GOVERNOR PUTS A HOLD

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.180
ON EVERYTHING THEN. THIS IS ALL

02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:07.485
ACADEMIC. AND DINNER SO IN THAT

02:22:07.552 --> 02:22:08.720
REGARD I WOULD ALSO. GIVE YOU A

02:22:08.786 --> 02:22:10.054
COUPLE OF IDEAS ONE IS THAT WE

02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:11.789
SHOULD FOCUS ON THE VISITOR

02:22:11.856 --> 02:22:14.759
CENTER AT THE SAME TIME. TWO S.

02:22:14.826 --> 02:22:16.527
THE TYPE CIRCLE SQUARED A

02:22:16.594 --> 02:22:18.529
DOUBLE T. EITHER ONE WORKS FOR

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:19.831
ME SO I DON'T HAVE LIKE A

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:21.966
STRONG BIAS. BUT WOULD YOU

02:22:22.033 --> 02:22:23.768
LEAST BEFORE WE HEAR SPEAKERS

02:22:23.835 --> 02:22:25.536
COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR

02:22:25.603 --> 02:22:26.771
PERSPECTIVES AS WELL ON THE

02:22:26.838 --> 02:22:29.240
TREES AND THE CONCERN THAT

02:22:29.307 --> 02:22:30.074
PEOPLE ARE HAVING. ABOUT THE

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:36.314
PARK. YEAH. ON THE- ON THE

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:38.316
TREES FROM A E. I. R.

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:40.184
STANDPOINT YOU END UP PUTTING A

02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:43.121
LARGE. MARK ON THE GROUND WHERE

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:45.323
THE PROJECT WILL BE SITUATED.

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.226
OF FROM DAY ONE. WE HAVE

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:50.862
FOCUSED ON HOW TO MINIMIZE THE

02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:52.063
IMPACT ON THE TREES LOOKING

02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:53.765
VERY CLOSELY AT THE FOOT PRINT

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:55.700
SERVER EXAMPLE THE VISITOR

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:57.235
CENTERS TO THE DEODAR CEDARS

02:22:57.302 --> 02:22:59.337
ARE OUT FOR THE VISITOR CENTER.

02:22:59.404 --> 02:23:00.471
WE'RE NOT EXPECTED TO TOUCH

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:02.407
THOSE TO BYRON SHIRE TREATED

02:23:02.473 --> 02:23:04.943
MARKETEER TREE OF THE SELF

02:23:05.009 --> 02:23:06.210
INTEREST OF WHOLE LINE OF NOT

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:07.445
GOING TO TOUCH THOSE OR THAT

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:12.717
SOUTH LAWN. THE PARKING GARAGE

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:13.818
WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE TO PLACE

02:23:13.885 --> 02:23:16.354
IT. WAS A CONVERSATION SELF ON

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:18.623
NORTH LAWN. ORDER TWELVE STREET

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:21.192
ALIGNMENT. IT'S NOT A REAL

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:22.060
PROBLEM BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.127
LOOK AT THE PARKING GARAGE

02:23:23.194 --> 02:23:25.163
YOU'LL SEE A NOTCH. ON THE EAST

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:26.898
SIDE ADJACENT TO THE TULIP

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.933
TREE. WE HAVE A GRAND TOTAL OF

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.468
THREE OUT THERE THE LAWN. NEAR

02:23:30.535 --> 02:23:31.970
THE FISH POND WHICH IS THE

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:33.838
NOTCHES DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD

02:23:33.905 --> 02:23:40.778
THAT TREE. SO THE. THE PLAN OF

02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:42.347
THIS PROJECT IS TO BE

02:23:42.413 --> 02:23:45.216
COMPATIBLE WITH THE PARK TO THE

02:23:45.283 --> 02:23:47.285
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND I

02:23:47.352 --> 02:23:49.020
PERSONALLY FEEL A CONSIDERATION

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:51.556
IS THE AESTHETIC OF THE- HOW

02:23:51.622 --> 02:23:52.156
THE BUILDING LOOKS INSIDE THE

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:55.660
PARK I SORT OF LIKE A CIRCLE

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:57.562
BUT I TOO AM OPEN TO WHATEVER

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.364
DESIGN PEOPLE WANT TO GO WITH.

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:00.665
BUT I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S

02:24:00.732 --> 02:24:01.833
SORT OF RECEIPTS AWAY IT

02:24:01.899 --> 02:24:03.301
DOESN'T LOOK QUITE SO. A

02:24:03.368 --> 02:24:07.805
MASSIVE. SO YEAH I WOULD SAY

02:24:07.872 --> 02:24:10.608
THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:14.946
BE. SAFEGUARD THE TREES TO THE

02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:17.015
UTMOST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND I

02:24:17.081 --> 02:24:18.916
ADMIT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:20.885
AYE ARE YOU SEE A LARGE AREA

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:22.954
THAT IS MARKED. THAT MIGHT

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:26.357
INVOLVE THE PROJECT FROM L. TO

02:24:26.424 --> 02:24:29.794
N. TO TEN. AND OF COURSE THE

02:24:29.861 --> 02:24:30.895
WALKWAY BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:32.930
DISTURB ALL THAT GROUND. AND I

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:34.966
ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE REMOVAL

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:37.301
OF THE DRIVEWAYS. SO ANYONE WHO

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:39.470
WANTS TO WALK THE LENGTH OF THE

02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:41.272
PARK BESIDE THE BUILDING CAN DO

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:44.742
SO WITHOUT RUNNING INTO THAT.

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:45.877
THAT FENCE ON BOTH SIDES. I

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:49.547
FEEL THAT IS A GREAT ADDITION.

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:51.382
AND JUST A LINE OF SIGHT THAT

02:24:51.449 --> 02:24:53.751
THAT WOULD AFFORD OF THIS VISTA

02:24:53.818 --> 02:25:01.826
WITHIN THE PARK. AND. YEAH I

02:25:01.893 --> 02:25:05.263
CONSIDER THAT OF. ON THE

02:25:05.329 --> 02:25:06.264
FUNDING GENERALLY THAT IS

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:07.498
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WORK OUT

02:25:07.565 --> 02:25:09.534
WITH THE GOVERNOR WE WILL BE IN

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:10.401
A POSITION TO MOVE INTO THE

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:12.036
SPRING SPACE IN OCTOBER OF NEXT

02:25:12.103 --> 02:25:14.105
YEAR. THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE

02:25:14.172 --> 02:25:17.141
SOMETHING THAT. VIEW THE LANDS

02:25:17.208 --> 02:25:19.043
OF THE ANY CONVENTIONS THE

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:20.078
CALIFORNIA A LETTER THE

02:25:20.144 --> 02:25:22.780
JASINSKI OF EVERYTHING WE START

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:24.649
MUCKING OUT UP A LITTLE BIT

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:25.416
WHEN WE WERE IN ONE PLACE AND

02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:28.352
THEN THE CHAMBERS ARE OVER HERE

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:30.321
WORKING WAITING SESSIONS WE

02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:31.989
WILL USE OUR BIG HEARING ROOMS

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:33.491
IN THE NEW BUILDING BUT THEY'LL

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:34.592
BE OTHER HEARING ROOM STILL

02:25:34.659 --> 02:25:36.394
OVER HERE PEOPLE BE. SHUTTLING

02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:39.897
BACK AND FORTH- PEOPLE WHO COME

02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:40.832
TO PARTICIPATE WILL HAVE TO GO

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.533
THROUGH METAL DETECTORS

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.235
MULTIPLE TIMES IN ORDER TO

02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:48.906
VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES AND- YOU

02:25:48.973 --> 02:25:52.777
KNOW I TOTALLY AGREE THAT THERE

02:25:52.844 --> 02:25:54.579
IS AN ECONOMIC VALUE FROM

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:56.114
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY FROM

02:25:56.180 --> 02:26:00.284
PROJECT ACTIVITY- I THANK AS

02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:01.853
THEY DID A HUNDREDS OF YEARS

02:26:01.919 --> 02:26:02.620
AGO YOU SORT OF TAKE THE LONG

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:06.124
VIEW. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- I

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.726
BELIEVE WILL INDEED BENEFIT OUR

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.695
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. IN

02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:11.295
NINETEEN FIFTY TWO WE DIDN'T

02:26:11.362 --> 02:26:12.897
HAVE MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS IN

02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:14.332
THE BILL THEIR PEOPLE WITH.

02:26:14.398 --> 02:26:17.802
SERIOUS IMPAIRMENTS. TO BE

02:26:17.869 --> 02:26:18.903
ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS THE

02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:20.438
GOVERNMENT LIFE IN THE SAME WAY

02:26:20.505 --> 02:26:22.273
THEY DO TODAY. AND YET THEY

02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:23.975
COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL TODAY

02:26:24.041 --> 02:26:27.545
AND THEIR- YOU KNOW. I MAY GO

02:26:27.612 --> 02:26:28.946
THIS WAY YOU HAVE TO GO ANOTHER

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:30.748
WAY WE HAVE THESE LIFT WOULD

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:32.750
SEEM A LITTLE PRECARIOUS OF

02:26:32.817 --> 02:26:34.252
YOUR WATCH OF. AN OPERATION

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:35.653
IT'S DEFINITELY KINDA LIVING

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:40.158
OUT THE CAPITALS VALUES- TO

02:26:40.224 --> 02:26:42.059
WELCOME PEOPLE TO THE BUILDING.

02:26:42.126 --> 02:26:43.528
SO I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THE LONG

02:26:43.594 --> 02:26:45.062
TERM GOAL IS TO ALIGN THE

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.731
CAPITAL WITH THESE. BASIC

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:52.803
VALUES. BUT PART OF IT WAS. HOW

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:54.405
MANY JOBS ARE CREATED PUTS THE

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:58.042
ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR- FOR THE

02:26:58.109 --> 02:27:02.747
REGION. I'M IT'S A IT'S A GREAT

02:27:02.813 --> 02:27:04.282
GREAT QUESTION ONE OF THE

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:06.217
THINGS THAT WE FOUND- BECAUSE

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:07.985
WE DID THE UTAH STATE CAPITOL

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:10.621
DURING THE RECESSION AND ONE OF

02:27:10.688 --> 02:27:12.790
THE THINGS THAT- WE WERE TOLD

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:15.626
IS THAT- CONSTRUCTION TYPICALLY

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:18.496
TURNS A DOLLAR BETWEEN NINE AND

02:27:18.563 --> 02:27:20.264
ELEVEN TIMES SO AN AVERAGE OF

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:22.266
ABOUT TEN TIMES WHICH IS ONE OF

02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:24.535
THE HIGHEST TURNS WITHIN THE

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:26.637
ECONOMY. SO BY BUILDING

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:28.206
CONSTRUCTION YOU ACTUALLY MOVE

02:27:28.272 --> 02:27:29.840
MORE MONEY INTO THE ECONOMY AND

02:27:29.907 --> 02:27:31.142
YOU GET MORE PEOPLE THE

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:33.744
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND IT AND TO

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.246
UTILIZE IT THAN YOU DO IN ANY

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:38.516
THEN AND THE OTHER SEGMENTS OF

02:27:38.583 --> 02:27:39.617
THE ECONOMY AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

02:27:39.684 --> 02:27:41.152
SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S

02:27:41.219 --> 02:27:42.987
BENEFICIAL AND THEN JUST TO

02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:45.523
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT TREES. ONE

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.657
OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING TO

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:48.092
PROTECT THE TREES IS REMOVING

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:50.661
THE RAPS OUT. INTO THE STREET

02:27:50.728 --> 02:27:51.963
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CITY OF

02:27:52.029 --> 02:27:53.831
SACRAMENTO SO THAT WE- DON'T

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:56.467
HAVE TO TEAR UP THE TREES WITH

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:58.302
WITHIN THE SITE THAT IS. ADDING

02:27:58.369 --> 02:28:00.238
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

02:28:00.304 --> 02:28:01.472
THE OVERALL BUDGET PART OF

02:28:01.539 --> 02:28:04.575
THAT. 710% OVERAGE IS BECAUSE

02:28:04.642 --> 02:28:06.677
WE ARE BUILDING THOSE RAMPS.

02:28:06.744 --> 02:28:07.979
AND SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF WORK

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:10.681
THROUGH THAT- BUT THE IDEA IS

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:14.518
TO SAVE THOSE. THOSE TREES. IN

02:28:14.585 --> 02:28:15.920
ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE WE

02:28:15.987 --> 02:28:17.221
BROKE THE TREES INTO THREE

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:19.690
CATEGORIES- THOSE TREES THAT

02:28:19.757 --> 02:28:24.862
ARE- HISTORIC. AND PARDON ARE

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:28.065
BEING SAVED OR OR OR MOVED.

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:29.834
WITHIN DEAL WITH THE TREES

02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.136
THAT- HAVE TO BE REMOVED OR

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.938
REPLACED AND THEN WE HAVE THE-

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:35.306
THE PALM TREES AND SO WE'RE

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:36.607
TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL AS

02:28:36.674 --> 02:28:38.042
WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH GROUP OF

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:40.344
THOSE TREES. SO THAT WE ARE

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:42.446
DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN TO

02:28:42.513 --> 02:28:44.482
MINIMIZE THE DISRUPTION. TO THE

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:46.951
SITE WITH REGARDS TO TREES AND

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:48.419
TO THE DESIGN THAT'S WHY THE

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:50.621
PARKING STRUCTURE WAS MOVED.

02:28:50.688 --> 02:28:52.023
FROM THE SOUTH WHERE WE THOUGHT

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:54.058
IT MIGHT GO INITIALLY. TO THE

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:56.294
EAST BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT WE

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.496
WERE ABLE TO. REALLY SAVE A

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:00.531
GREAT NUMBER OF TREES. MISTER

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:01.799
HART JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION

02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:02.867
SINCE YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU

02:29:02.933 --> 02:29:04.869
DID THE UTAH CAPITOL DURING A

02:29:04.935 --> 02:29:07.738
RECESSION. HOW MUCH LOWER THE

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:10.641
ACTUAL. COST SCHOOL BELOW YOUR-

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:13.277
ESTIMATES RESERVE 10% 20%

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:15.046
SAVINGS BECAUSE- YOU COULD

02:29:15.112 --> 02:29:19.216
PRICE THINGS MUCH BETTER SURE-

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:20.818
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE

02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:22.653
UTAH CAPITOL. WAS HAPPENING

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:25.856
DURING A- AN ECONOMIC RECESSION

02:29:25.923 --> 02:29:28.592
DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN

02:29:28.659 --> 02:29:29.393
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND TWO

02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:31.195
THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND SO IT

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:33.164
WAS LARGELY JUST A SLOWDOWN IN

02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:34.732
THE ECONOMY THERE FOR WHAT WE

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:38.169
SAW WE SAW A LOWERING. OF

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:39.537
CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ACROSS

02:29:39.603 --> 02:29:41.906
THE STATE WE SAW LOWERING OF

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:44.375
ECONOMIC SPENDING- WHICH IS A

02:29:44.442 --> 02:29:45.176
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:47.144
WE'RE SEEING TODAY WHICH IS I

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:47.878
THINK THE POINT YOU'RE TRYING

02:29:47.945 --> 02:29:50.114
TO GET TO. TODAY THE PROBLEM WE

02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:54.385
HAVE IS THAT- THE MATERIALS.

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:57.822
ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY- AND SO. IF

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.123
YOU LOOK AT THE LAW OF SUPPLY

02:29:59.190 --> 02:30:00.391
AND DEMAND IS A LITTLE

02:30:00.458 --> 02:30:03.127
DIFFERENT THAN YOUR TYPICAL.

02:30:03.194 --> 02:30:05.730
RECESSION ORDER OR OR SLOWDOWN

02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:07.231
OF THE ECONOMY BECAUSE WHAT'S

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:09.133
FORCING THAT IS BECAUSE WORKERS

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.801
ARE ABLE TO GO AND DO THE WORK

02:30:10.868 --> 02:30:12.470
THEY NORMALLY DO AND PRODUCE

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.471
THE PRODUCTS THEY TYPICALLY

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:15.673
PRODUCE. RATHER THAN SEEING IT

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.875
REDUCING COST WE'RE SEEING SOME

02:30:17.942 --> 02:30:19.744
PRODUCTS ACTUALLY RAISING COST.

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:22.012
WE DO THINK THAT OVERALL-

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:24.115
MOVING INTO THIS YEAR AND INTO

02:30:24.181 --> 02:30:25.783
NEXT YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:29.754
A REDUCTION. OF ESCALATION AND

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:31.188
WE BELIEVE THAT ESCALATION WILL

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:33.424
EITHER BE FLAT OR LOWER OVER

02:30:33.491 --> 02:30:37.128
THE NEXT YEAR. BY PERCENT OR TO

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:37.728
THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:39.397
PAST AND WE HAVE AN ECONOMIST

02:30:39.463 --> 02:30:41.265
WHO WORKS. FOR US WHO IS

02:30:41.332 --> 02:30:42.867
PROJECTING THAT THAT ESCALATION

02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:44.869
WILL FLATTEN OUT ACTUALLY DROP.

02:30:44.935 --> 02:30:46.237
THERE MAY BE SOME SEGMENTS OF

02:30:46.303 --> 02:30:48.439
THE ECONOMY TO GO UP AND SOME

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:52.243
OF THOSE WILL HOLD FLAT SO I

02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.710
HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

02:30:52.777 --> 02:30:53.277
QUESTIONS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

02:30:53.344 --> 02:30:55.212
THE TYPICAL RECESSION VERY

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:56.313
GOOD. ASSEMBLY WOMAN COME

02:30:56.380 --> 02:31:00.017
LONGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:02.486
I AM ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

02:31:02.553 --> 02:31:04.021
THIS VERY COMPREHENSIVE

02:31:04.088 --> 02:31:07.992
PRESENTATION- MY QUESTIONS ARE

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:11.429
ALONG THE- LINES OF MY

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:17.935
COLLEAGUES THAT JUST SPOKE. YOU

02:31:18.002 --> 02:31:18.969
KNOW AS THE STATE IS TIGHTENING.

02:31:19.036 --> 02:31:23.607
OUR BUDGET BELT. I DO THINK IT

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:25.075
WOULD BE GOOD AND I KNOW WE

02:31:25.142 --> 02:31:26.277
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AT AN

02:31:26.343 --> 02:31:28.512
EARLIER JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:30.714
BUT IT IT MIGHT BE NICE AS A

02:31:30.781 --> 02:31:33.017
REFRESHER JUST TO GET AN

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:36.320
ESTIMATED NUMBER OF JOBS- THAT

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:38.088
IT WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE THE

02:31:38.155 --> 02:31:40.324
ENTIRE PROJECT BECAUSE AS WE

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:41.992
ARE TALKING ABOUT A RECESSION

02:31:42.059 --> 02:31:44.094
AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU

02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:46.197
KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT- IT WOULD BE

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:47.898
NICE TO HAVE A COUNTER WITH

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:50.100
REAL NUMBERS AS IT RELATES TO

02:31:50.167 --> 02:31:55.039
JOBS- THAT WILL BE. CREATED AS

02:31:55.105 --> 02:31:59.743
A RESULT OF THIS- AT ENDEAVOR.

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:02.780
I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:04.815
TO ALSO HAVE SOME REAL NUMBERS

02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:06.717
AROUND THE PAST CONSIDERATIONS

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:11.589
FOR DELAY IN MY PRIOR. LIFE ON

02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:13.157
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD WE

02:32:13.224 --> 02:32:17.094
WERE DEALING WITH CONSTRUCTION.

02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:19.597
I CRY SEVEN CAMPUSES AND EVERY

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:23.534
SMALL THING IN KHURDA CAR. AND

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:26.470
SOMETIMES YOU'RE MAKING

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:28.105
AESTHETIC DECISIONS AND THEN

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:29.406
OTHER TIMES ARE MAKING

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:33.944
BUDGETARY DECISIONS SO. IT

02:32:34.011 --> 02:32:34.545
MIGHT BE HELPFUL AT LEAST FOR

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:35.513
ME JUST TO GET A FROM FROM WHAT

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:36.480
THE CAR CONSIDERING WOULD FOR

02:32:36.547 --> 02:32:44.855
THE LAKE OF THE VISITORS CENTER.

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:50.427
ABOUT MY HAVE IS THIS FOR

02:32:50.494 --> 02:32:53.030
CONTRAST SO ARE THE ANNEXED BY

02:32:53.097 --> 02:32:54.765
IS IN SIZE TO THE NATURAL

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:55.866
RESOURCE HEADQUARTERS WERE

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.868
BUILDING DOWN THE STREET ON

02:32:57.935 --> 02:32:59.036
THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:02.606
REPORTING TO WORK SEVENTEEN

02:33:02.673 --> 02:33:03.173
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WORKER

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:06.176
MONTHS WHICH MEANS A WORKER

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:06.810
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

02:33:06.877 --> 02:33:08.379
WORKERS WORKING FOR A MONTH ON

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:10.014
UP ON THAT PROJECT SO IT'S A

02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.916
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK FOR

02:33:11.982 --> 02:33:15.419
WORKERS THAT WERE PUT IN TO

02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:16.887
WORK ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS.

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:22.726
THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. V. SO I

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.662
MEAN I'VE I'M TO THE THIRTY

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:25.863
DESIGN BUT I THINK AT THE END

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:27.197
OF THE DAY I THINK I'M ALSO

02:33:27.264 --> 02:33:28.465
PARTIAL TO THE DESIGN THAT

02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:30.200
MIGHT COME IN UNDER BUDGET MOST

02:33:30.267 --> 02:33:32.202
QUICKLY AND ALSO TO THE DESIGN

02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:34.004
THAT WILL SAVE THE MOST SPACE I

02:33:34.071 --> 02:33:36.307
FEEL YOU KNOW AS WE'RE DEALING

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:38.576
WITH. WILDFIRESIT SEEMS LIKE

02:33:38.642 --> 02:33:40.778
EVERY DAY HEY OF THE YEAR. I

02:33:40.844 --> 02:33:43.480
CAN'T GET ENOUGH. OF THE OXYGEN

02:33:43.547 --> 02:33:45.215
THAT COMES FROM TREES AND SO

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.850
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO FACE HAS

02:33:46.917 --> 02:33:50.621
MANY OF THEM. I AM FOR. AND

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:52.389
THEN LASTLY I JUST I DIDN'T

02:33:52.456 --> 02:33:55.392
WANT TO KNOW. PARDEE DESIGNS

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:57.361
REFEREE TWO OTHER MUNICIPAL

02:33:57.428 --> 02:34:00.497
BUILDING BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES

02:34:00.564 --> 02:34:01.765
OR SOME SORT OF HISTORICAL

02:34:01.832 --> 02:34:04.034
REFERENCE ALL CONNECTION TO THE

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:06.403
DESIGN SO I JUST ADDED NUMBER

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:07.237
THREE I MENTIONED THAT WHEN SHE

02:34:07.304 --> 02:34:09.373
WAS IN MEXICO CITY SHE WAS IN A

02:34:09.440 --> 02:34:12.242
BUILDING THAT WAS CIRCULAR. AND

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:14.778
SO I JUST I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:16.981
WAS IN HERE I DIDN'T SEE IT.

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:17.748
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE MY

02:34:17.815 --> 02:34:20.751
QUESTION. YES I GENEVA PLEASE

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:25.990
GO AHEAD- IT'S INTERESTING THAT.

02:34:26.056 --> 02:34:27.658
IF YOU GO BACK TO SOME OF THE

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:30.027
NATIVE AMERICAN AND SOME OF THE

02:34:30.094 --> 02:34:31.862
POLYNESIAN AND SOME OF THE

02:34:31.929 --> 02:34:35.399
SOUTH AMERICA SOUTH. PACIFIC

02:34:35.466 --> 02:34:37.334
ISLANDER PEOPLE A LOT OF THEIR

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.470
CEREMONIAL GATHERINGS WHERE THE

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:40.971
CHIEFS WOULD COME TOGETHER TO

02:34:41.038 --> 02:34:43.574
TALK WOULD BE IN A CIRCULAR

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:45.042
BUILDING SO IT'S KIND OF AN

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:48.312
INTERESTING THING I CAN TELL

02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:48.912
YOU THAT WE DIDN'T START WITH

02:34:48.979 --> 02:34:52.816
THAT IN MIND I THINK THE- THEN

02:34:52.883 --> 02:34:54.418
THE NOTION OF A CIRCULAR

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:56.587
BUILDING IF YOU LOOK AT-

02:34:56.654 --> 02:34:58.989
THERE'S A BUILDING AND- FRANCE

02:34:59.056 --> 02:35:01.225
I BELIEVE THAT IS THE- EUROPEAN

02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:01.825
UNION'S HEADQUARTERS A

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:04.161
CIRCULAR- AND THERE'S A NUMBER

02:35:04.228 --> 02:35:07.097
OF. OF BUILDINGS ARE CIRCULAR

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:10.300
KIND OF THE NOTES- UNITY AND IT

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:13.103
KIND OF THE NOTES- THAT NO-

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:14.605
EVERYBODY'S KIND OF THE CORE.

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:17.207
WHICH I THINK IS VERY GOOD THAT

02:35:17.274 --> 02:35:19.243
THE DOUBLE T. IS REALLY A- A

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.377
BUILDING THAT HAS KIND OF

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:21.812
EVOLVED FROM THE NOTION OF HOW

02:35:21.879 --> 02:35:24.381
DO WE SAVE. AS MANY TREES AS WE

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:25.783
POSSIBLY CAN SO PULLING THE

02:35:25.849 --> 02:35:27.618
CONSTRUCTION AWAY AND THEN

02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:30.120
ALLOWING THE FIRST TEE SO TO

02:35:30.187 --> 02:35:32.489
SPEAK TO BE SHORTER. AND THE

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:33.190
OTHER ONE TO BE A LITTLE A

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:34.525
LITTLE FURTHER OUT AND THE

02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:37.027
SQUARE IS TRYING TO TAKE A

02:35:37.094 --> 02:35:39.329
MINIMALISTIC APPROACH. I DON'T

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:40.431
KNOW JOSE IF YOU WANT TO ADD

02:35:40.497 --> 02:35:43.167
ANYTHING TO THAT YEAH SURE YEAH

02:35:43.233 --> 02:35:46.103
THERE'S ALWAYS A- METAPHOR FOR

02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:48.072
A- CONNECTION YOU KNOW FOR

02:35:48.138 --> 02:35:51.642
WHAT. WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:53.310
THAT THE CIRCLE. HE IT IS A

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:55.279
GALLAGHER. LET'S SAY THAT

02:35:55.345 --> 02:35:57.614
ANOTHER- YEAH COMMITTEE JUST

02:35:57.681 --> 02:35:59.216
BECAUSE OF CONTINUED FOR THE

02:35:59.283 --> 02:36:02.286
CLUB AND ALL FIVE RIGHT- EAT

02:36:02.352 --> 02:36:03.987
YET WE HAVE ONLY TWO CORNERS

02:36:04.054 --> 02:36:05.856
BECAUSE OF THE INCISION WHERE

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:07.758
MAKING TO MAKE THE ENTRY BUT IF

02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:10.394
WE DIDN'T DO THAT. EVERY SPACES

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:13.097
SIDE WOULD BE PRETTY EQUAL. AND

02:36:13.163 --> 02:36:16.333
IN A SENSE. THAT IS- A BIT OF A

02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:18.702
DEMOCRACY MY OPINION- THAT THAT

02:36:18.769 --> 02:36:20.137
EVERYONE HAS A VOICE AND

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:22.740
EVERYONE. HAS AN EQUAL SO THAT

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.541
THERE'S SOME SORT OF ET

02:36:24.608 --> 02:36:28.245
METAPHOR THERE'S THAT THAT ONE

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:29.513
CAN MAKE A CONNECTION EIGHT

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:31.682
ALSO SOME. THAT IN THIS

02:36:31.749 --> 02:36:34.384
BUILDING THAT THAT THAT THAT'S

02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:37.654
ALL RIGHT IN THE- UNDERNEATH IS.

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:39.423
THE PLAZA IN FRONT THE EARTH

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:43.494
THAN THAT. FIVE FORGET THE NAME

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:44.962
OF THE OTHER BUILDING IS ALSO

02:36:45.028 --> 02:36:49.867
SO. A IN THE APT THE WITH A OUT

02:36:49.933 --> 02:36:53.170
HAD HELLO THE CIRCULAR EVEN

02:36:53.237 --> 02:36:55.806
THOUGH IT WAS NOT COME CIRCLE.

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:56.540
SO THERE IS SOME SORT OF A

02:36:56.607 --> 02:37:00.210
PRESS OF FUNDING. IF YOU IF YOU

02:37:00.277 --> 02:37:01.211
LOOK AT THE HAS SOME OF THE

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.247
ORIGINAL PLAN OF THE PART THEY

02:37:03.313 --> 02:37:07.484
WERE AN OLD. IN THE AREA THAT

02:37:07.551 --> 02:37:08.719
MUST BE CARRIED IN THE BACK

02:37:08.786 --> 02:37:11.221
THAT. IS FELLOW JUST TO BE GIVE

02:37:11.288 --> 02:37:14.057
PRESS PREFERENCE TO THAT TO THE

02:37:14.124 --> 02:37:17.895
THAT EAST WEST AXIS WHICH IS AB.

02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:23.801
IN THE SORT OF PERSPECTIVE. SO

02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:25.669
THERE ARE SOME PRESS FOR THAT.

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:27.838
THAT WILL BE A THE RED.

02:37:27.905 --> 02:37:29.840
BUILDINGS ARE VERY WELL AS HERE

02:37:29.907 --> 02:37:31.809
THIS BILL IS I MAY CUTTING. OF

02:37:31.875 --> 02:37:34.645
THAT SO THAT NOTHING WRONG WITH

02:37:34.711 --> 02:37:37.481
THE OTHER AS WELL SO THAT THAT

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:39.917
SORT OF MY PERSPECTIVE. I WANT

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:41.685
TO ASK A THE SMALL THE BEFORE I

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:45.122
GO TO THE GAL. PHONE OPERATOR

02:37:45.189 --> 02:37:46.356
IS SENATOR BOB HERTZBERG ON THE

02:37:46.423 --> 02:37:54.965
LINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

ONLINE YOU MAY PRESS STAR THEN

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:07.811
ZERO. WELL WE'RE DOING ANY

02:38:07.878 --> 02:38:10.113
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:12.950
GENERALS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR.

02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:14.318
FOR MATHIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:16.220
MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:19.056
THINK WE FOR A LOT OF COMMENTS

02:38:19.122 --> 02:38:20.657
I THINK A LOT OF US BORROWED

02:38:20.724 --> 02:38:23.126
INGREDIENTS I THINK MY BIGGEST

02:38:23.193 --> 02:38:26.396
QUESTION RIGHT NOW AND I. IS

02:38:26.463 --> 02:38:30.200
IT- IT'S UNFORTUNATELY- THAT WE

02:38:30.267 --> 02:38:31.735
DO NOT HAVE QUORUM TODAY

02:38:31.802 --> 02:38:32.803
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF US

02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:34.504
WOULD WANT TO VOTE TO MOVE

02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:38.208
FORWARD- JUST IN THE FACT THAT.

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:41.879
YOU KNOW WHAT IF. WE CAN SAY

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:43.780
LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

02:38:43.847 --> 02:38:45.048
SQUARE THE CIRCLE LEARN THE

02:38:45.115 --> 02:38:48.051
DOUBLE T. DAN. OUR FOLKS THAT

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:49.353
ARE DOING ALL OF THIS GREAT

02:38:49.419 --> 02:38:50.354
WORK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:52.723
TODAY THEN THEY'RE NOT SPENDING

02:38:52.789 --> 02:38:55.492
EXTRA TIME AND MONEY. LOOKING

02:38:55.559 --> 02:38:59.930
AT THESE OTHER OPTIONS. I WISH

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:01.598
THAT WE COULD SAY HEY LET'S

02:39:01.665 --> 02:39:03.634
TAKE THE DOUBLE T. OFF THE

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:08.171
TABLE OR YOU KNOW LET'S FIND TO

02:39:08.238 --> 02:39:09.239
DATE BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:10.741
HAVE A CAR I DON'T KNOW IF

02:39:10.807 --> 02:39:11.375
THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:39:11.441 --> 02:39:14.344
MEASURE ON THAT CAN BE DONE

02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:16.513
THROUGH THE AUTHORITY- OF THE

02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:20.117
CHAIRS. BLUT A THINK THAT IF WE

02:39:20.183 --> 02:39:23.820
GET. KIND OF BRING IT DOWN- WE

02:39:23.887 --> 02:39:25.122
WOULD ALSO SEE A LOT OF MONEY

02:39:25.188 --> 02:39:27.224
INCOME A LOT OF TIME ON FOR

02:39:27.291 --> 02:39:28.158
THOSE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH

02:39:28.225 --> 02:39:29.393
THIS PLANNING PROCESS SIX

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:31.028
SPECIALLY AS AS MENTIONED

02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:34.364
EARLIER BY OUR COLLEAGUES- WITH

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.465
THE RECESSION WITH EVERYTHING

02:39:35.532 --> 02:39:36.967
ELSE FOR EVERYBODY VERY.

02:39:37.034 --> 02:39:39.870
CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE

02:39:39.937 --> 02:39:42.839
SPENDING ADDITIONAL FONTS A

02:39:42.906 --> 02:39:45.175
DEFINING UNFORTUNATELY THAT WE

02:39:45.242 --> 02:39:48.078
DO NOT HAVE MEMBERS HERE-

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.012
PERSONALLY AFTER LOOKING AT

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:50.113
EVERYTHING AFTER LOOKING AT ALL

02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:52.316
THE NUMBERS AFTER LOOKING AT

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:54.384
THE ECOLOGICAL REPORTS ON YOU

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:57.120
KNOW HOW WE SEE THE MOST TREES.

02:39:57.187 --> 02:40:00.123
HOW DO WE SAVE THE MOST MONEY-

02:40:00.190 --> 02:40:01.792
SECURITY PUBLIC SPACE

02:40:01.858 --> 02:40:04.928
EVERYTHING- I THINK THE BEST

02:40:04.995 --> 02:40:07.597
THIS. MODEL FOR US TO GO

02:40:07.664 --> 02:40:09.766
FORWARD WITH WOULD BE THE

02:40:09.833 --> 02:40:14.304
CIRCLE. I DO APPRECIATE THE

02:40:14.371 --> 02:40:18.742
HISTORY LESSON ON ON WITH THE.

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:20.077
WHERE THE CIRCLE CAME FROM MY

02:40:20.143 --> 02:40:22.145
IT REMINDS ME OF- MY OLD ART

02:40:22.212 --> 02:40:24.314
HISTORY CLASSES BUT- WE LIKE

02:40:24.381 --> 02:40:25.849
TAMARA GRECO ROMAN AND

02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:27.985
COLISEUM'S IN THOSE THINGS-

02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:29.987
GOING BACK AND SOME OF YOU IN

02:40:30.053 --> 02:40:32.856
THE GOTHIC DESIGN. VOIGTS I

02:40:32.923 --> 02:40:34.558
THINK THE MEANING BEHIND THAT

02:40:34.624 --> 02:40:36.893
ALSO CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT.

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:39.162
BUT THE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:41.498
PUBLIC THE PUBLIC SPACE- THE

02:40:41.565 --> 02:40:44.634
ABILITY FOR THEM TO SEE THE

02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:46.770
DOWN ON THE TICKET AND THE BILL

02:40:46.837 --> 02:40:48.238
TO HAVE THAT GALLERY TO

02:40:48.305 --> 02:40:50.741
SHOWCASE- ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:40:50.807 --> 02:40:52.642
AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. IS

02:40:52.709 --> 02:40:56.079
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WELL BUT-

02:40:56.146 --> 02:40:59.349
AGAIN THE QUESTION IS MORE OF.

02:40:59.416 --> 02:41:00.851
IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE

02:41:00.917 --> 02:41:02.185
AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHICH

02:41:02.252 --> 02:41:04.021
IS USUALLY SOMETHING I'M NOT IN

02:41:04.087 --> 02:41:06.990
FAVOR OF- TO CUT SOME TIME AND

02:41:07.057 --> 02:41:10.560
MONEY SO. OUR DESIGN TEAM ISN'T

02:41:10.627 --> 02:41:11.661
SPINNING THEIR WHEELS ON

02:41:11.728 --> 02:41:13.430
SOMETHING MOST OF US ARE IN

02:41:13.497 --> 02:41:14.197
AGREEMENT WITH YEAH I

02:41:14.264 --> 02:41:17.667
ANTICIPATE THAT WHILE. I DO SEE

02:41:17.734 --> 02:41:19.436
THAT. SCHEDULE A JOINT RULES

02:41:19.503 --> 02:41:21.571
COMMITTEE MEETING BEFORE THE

02:41:21.638 --> 02:41:24.274
END OF THE MONTH. AND BRING UP

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:25.308
FOR FOUR DECISION. AND I THINK

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:29.713
OF. OUR DESIGN TEAM I HAVE TO

02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:31.815
SAY IS AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB TO

02:41:31.882 --> 02:41:33.850
CONJURE UP THREE FAIRLY

WE'RE SEEING TODAY OR TONIGHT

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.582
FOR THE FIRST TIME IS VERY

02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:14.317
DIFFERENT THAN THAT WAS IN THE

02:43:14.384 --> 02:43:17.521
RECIRCULATED DRAFT E. IR. I

02:43:17.587 --> 02:43:20.590
JUST NOTE THAT- THE NEW PARKING

02:43:20.657 --> 02:43:22.592
LOCATION THE STRIP ALONG

02:43:22.659 --> 02:43:25.028
TWELFTH STREET IS ABSOLUTELY

02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:28.732
NOT IN THE PREVIOUS E. I. R. IF

02:43:28.798 --> 02:43:30.600
WE TRUST THE ARBORIST THAT

02:43:30.667 --> 02:43:32.402
ANYTHING FIFTY FEET FROM AN

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:36.039
EXCAVATION. WOULD PUT IT RISK

02:43:36.106 --> 02:43:38.742
AT. I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT

02:43:38.808 --> 02:43:40.777
THE PARKING GARAGE LOCATION

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:43.013
WOULD IMPINGE WITHIN FIFTY FEET

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:45.282
OF THE CIVIL WAR GROWTH AND I

02:43:45.348 --> 02:43:46.616
KNOW THAT'S VERY PERSONALLY

02:43:46.683 --> 02:43:49.286
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU- SO IT

02:43:49.352 --> 02:43:51.021
CAUTIONED THERE IT APPEARS THE

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:53.690
DOUBLE T. SCHEME VIOLATES WHAT

02:43:53.757 --> 02:43:55.692
IN THE ARE WAS A PRIEST THE I.

02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:57.561
R. WAS A PRECEPT. WE WOULD NOT

02:43:57.627 --> 02:44:00.597
GO BEYOND THE NORTH AND SOUTH

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:03.133
BOUNDARIES OF THE HISTORIC

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:05.969

02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:09.906
SCHEME SEEMS TO DO THAT ALSO-

02:44:09.973 --> 02:44:12.742
AND IT ALSO PROTRUDES INTO THE

02:44:12.809 --> 02:44:15.178
TWELFTH ST ALIGNMENT WHICH WAS

02:44:15.245 --> 02:44:18.548
PRESERVED IN THE E. I. R. IT

02:44:18.615 --> 02:44:21.084

IN MULTIPLE FLOORS- SEEM LIKE

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:45.842
THEY WOULD BE SOMETHING KIND OF

02:44:45.909 --> 02:44:48.545
HARD TO EXPLAIN. AND FINALLY AS

02:44:48.612 --> 02:44:50.814
