SP.

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:38.216
FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR THE BILL

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:39.517

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:50.728
MEDIA PLATFORM.

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:51.863
THE DRAFT THE MODELS OF TEACHING

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.365
PLAN FOR SUCH PLATFORMS MITIGATE

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.367
THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:58.703
PLATFORMS.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.307
I DO STE SP FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.308
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CLEAR ISSUE

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:04.676
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPREAD OF

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:05.810
FALSE INFORMATION.

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:06.711
CERTAINLY IN OUR SOCIAL MEDIA

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.482
WORLD -- NOW

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.717
WE SEE FIRST ABOUT --

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:16.254
THE EARTH IS FLAT THEN.

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.255
SO FOR THAT NAY SEEMS A BIT

00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:18.623
AMUSING BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.526
GOT MORE SERIOUS SIDE YOU HAVE --

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:23.428
DISSEMINATION OF THE HOLOCAUST

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:26.097
DENIAL DENIALS.

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:29.067
SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED AT SANDY

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:30.535
HOOK AND PARK LAND WHICH ALSO

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:33.304
RESULTED NOT ONLY JUST YOU KNOW

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:37.408
COST INFORMATION BUT LED.

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:41.079
TO INTIMIDATION AND THREATS --

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:42.447
AND THEN WE EVEN MORE SERIOUSLY

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:45.049
PRONE TO MANIPULATION SO FOR

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:47.852
EXAMPLE SIDE.

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:48.920
AND YOU SAID IT WAS ACTUALLY

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:55.193
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA --

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.060
UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY SAYS

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:59.264
DIVISIONS --

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.698
I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT AND

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:02.233
MARCH TWENTY EIGHTEEN SCIENCE

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.434
MAGAZINE REPORTED THAT IN

00:30:03.501 --> 00:30:04.736
INVESTIGATING THE DIFFERENCE OF

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.938
THE FUSION OF ALL VERIFY TRUE

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.206
AND FALSE NEWS CHOICE SHOULD.

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:10.975
BETTER BETWEEN 200-062-00017

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.677
THAT FALSEHOODS IF YOU

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:14.646
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER FARTHER AND

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:15.613
DEEPER.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.315
AND MORE BROADLY THE TRUTH IN

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:18.383
ALL CHARACTERS INFORMATION IN

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.217
FACT THEY NOTED THAT --

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.019
FALSE INFORMATION ACT TO BE

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:21.953
TWICE AS FAR.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.855
AS THAT CHIU INFORMATION.

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:25.423
AND SAID SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.758
ARE PLATFORMS FALSE INFORMATION

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:28.226
SPREADS ITS CAN BECOME MORE

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.394
IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHY

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.362
THIS IS HAPPENING.

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:32.330
I KNOW THAT SEVERAL COMPANIES

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:33.598
ARE REALLY TRYING TO COME UP

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:34.599
WITH PLANTS THE DELEGATE THE

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:35.500
SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION THE

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:36.601
PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW WHAT THOSE

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:39.137
PLANS ARE AND HOW THE WORKING.

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:41.773
AND AS A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES --

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:44.576
TO LET US KNOW IF THEY HAVE.

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:46.177
PLANS ABOUT THOSE CLAIMS ARE CAN

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:49.280
BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE SPREAD.

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:49.881
COULD BE A WORK GROUP TO STUDY

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.449
RESEARCH PLAN MILES.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.351
STEPPED WORKING TO SLOW THE

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.786
SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION I

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:55.386
HOPE WE CAN BETTER PROTECT THE

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.888
PUBLIC.

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:59.390
HARM THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY.

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:02.160
BY THESE FALSE STORIES I WOULD

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:03.328
MAKE YOU KNOW THAT.

00:31:03.394 --> 00:31:03.928
WHAT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.997
CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND?

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:07.565
THAT PEOPLE THE FIRST.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:08.466
RIGHT TO POST WHICH UP WHATEVER

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.734
THEY WANT.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:10.501
AND THAT IT CERTAINLY THIS IS

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:13.404
NOT IN ANY WAY. TO LIMIT THE

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.807
ABILITY PEOPLE TO POST THINGS ON

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:17.809
SOCIAL BE A BAD THING AT THE END

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:19.544
OF THREE NEVER EARLIER

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:22.680
INNOVATION THAT DEL TERMS OF

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:23.281
QUIETLY YOU CAN'T THIS WORKING

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.549
GROUP -- WE

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.651
EVEN HAD CHALLENGES TRYING TO

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.852
JUST COME OF THE DEFINITION OF

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:28.453
WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA WAS IN LEGAL

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.721
TERMS.

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.122
OKAY AND EXACTLY WHAT WOULD FALL

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.457
UNDER THAT AND WEBER.

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:33.124
I THINK SOME OF THOSE ISSUES ARE

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.459
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE.

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.094
I WORKED OUT WITH VERY

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.828
STAKEHOLDERS IS VIA A WAY TO

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:37.462

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.098
TECHNOLOGY --

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:42.166
SO WE INSERT THE REGULAR MEDIA

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:45.169
THERE ARE MECHANISMS BOB IN

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.405
PLACE TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:47.939
WHILE STILL ALLOWING FIRST

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.008
AMENDMENTS.

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:51.242
RIGHTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:52.043
TO BE SURE WE PROTECT FIRST

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.411
AMENDMENT SPEECH RIGHTS BUT WE

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:54.679

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:04.489
SO.

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:06.391
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT NEED

AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.710
BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL WITH

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:49.012
THIS BILL IS TO HAVE TRUTH.

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:53.216
IN HOW THE INTERNET IS USED TO

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:55.385
CREATE DECEPTION.

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:56.553
WHETHER IT'S IN THE AREA OF

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.388
POLITICS JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN MY

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:00.323
ALEXIAN THIS VERY LAST TIME IN

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.025
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:03.660
WE SEE IT IN BUSINESSES WHERE

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.429
COMPANIES ARE SAYING THEY'VE GOT

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.930
SO MANY FOLLOWERS.

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:08.765
AND WE SEE THAT WERE CELEBRITIES

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.234
COME IN AND GO HIGHER COMPANIES.

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.169
WE DON'T WANT NO I KNOW THERE'S

00:51:12.235 --> 00:51:13.437
A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:15.272
APPROPRIATELY SO MORE SENSITIVE

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.239
TO WHAT ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.742
ISSUES IN THE ANALYSIS.

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:21.745
THE ISSUE IS NOT WHAT TO BE SAID

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.580
BUT THAT PEOPLE THAT WHEN YOU

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.515
TRY TO FAKE IT.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.917
WHEN YOU TRY TO CREATE THE

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.285
IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:29.486
TO A HUMAN BEING?

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:30.987
YOU'RE DOING THAT TO DECEIVE

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:33.123
SOMEBODY NOT IN THE NATURE OF

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.758
YOUR MESSAGE BUT WHO IS THE

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.193
MESSENGER.

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:38.128
AND SO THIS BOTS BILL IS TO US

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.930
IS A BIG DEAL WITH COMMON SENSE

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.298
TO SPONSOR WILL DO LET THEM TALK

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.466
IN A MINUTE.

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:44.668
BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.303
OF JUST DISCLOSURE THAT'S THE

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.305
MOST IMPORTANT THING IN SOME

00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:48.772
REASONABLE METHODS OF

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.539
ENFORCEMENT.

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.208
SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT WHEN

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:53.610
SOMEBODY SAYS IT'S KANSEN CHU ON

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:55.979
THE LINE IT'S NOT REALLY YOU ITS

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.848
JUST A NOTIFICATION THAT IF

00:51:57.914 --> 00:51:59.850
SOMEBODY SAYS THAT THERE YOU

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:00.717
COULD BE BOOK.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.519
LAST POINT I'LL MAKE.

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:03.820
FUNDAMENTAL THE CONSTITUTION IS

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:04.988
ANONYMITY.

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.623
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS THE FOLKS

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.424
THAT WROTE THAT THEY DID HAVE

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.092
THEIR NAMES ON IT THOMAS PAINE

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:11.361
DIDN'T NAMES ON COMMON SENSE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.629
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.130
BUT WE KNEW IT WAS SOME HUMAN

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.065
BEING.

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:15.665
THAT WAS BEHIND IT RATHER THAN

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:18.935
SOME.

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:21.605
KNOWLEDGE THE IN A DECEPTIVE WAY

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:22.639
AND UNDER THE LAW THERE'S A

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.441
BASIC CONT THERE'S A BASIC RIGHT

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:25.609
THAT IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:26.877
RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH.

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:29.379
AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.314
TO DO IT TEND NOT TO FRAUD TO BE

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:32.449
FREE OF THE FRAUD.

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.017
IS ALL THROUGHOUT THE LAW IS A

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:36.052
CRIME AGAINST FRAUD THAT'S ALL

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.621
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET JUST

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:41.791
WE DON'T CARE JUST LET US KNOW

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:43.093
THAT IT'S DONE THROUGH A

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:45.028
COMPUTER --

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.429

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:49.332

REASONABLY ASKING YOURSELF?
