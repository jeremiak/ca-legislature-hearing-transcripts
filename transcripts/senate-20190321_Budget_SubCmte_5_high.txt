SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE ON CORRECTIONS IN THE JUDICIARY. PUBLIC SAFETY WILL NOW. BEGIN CAN YOU CALL THE ROLL. CENTER SKINNER I'M HERE THERMAL AKA [inaudible] SIR ABOUT. ALL RIGHT SO I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY -- CHANGES TO ANNOUNCE ON THE AGENDA -- OUR HEARING TODAY IS PRIMARILY DISCUSSION ITEMS [inaudible] THE ONE SECOND. YOU WILL BE. HEARING ONE OF THE BUDGET CHANGE. BCP'S OR SAY BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THAT THING MEANS BUT WHATEVER -- WE WILL BE HEARING THAT IN ISSUE ONE BUT WE WON'T BE ACTING ON IT. I'M AND THEN WE WILL -- HAVE SOME OTHER ITEMS AS DESCRIBED ON THE AGENDA. BUT PART OF THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT -- OF SOME OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT NOW BEFORE I GO FURTHER WITH THAT. WE ARE -- R. J. LACKEY MEDI THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. DIRECTED THE STATE AUDITOR TO DO AN AUDIT OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHAB PROGRAMS AND THAT AUDIT WAS RELEASED. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND WE WILL HAVE. THE AUDITOR HERE. AT FUTURE HEARING TALK ABOUT THOSE FINDINGS. I'M BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO YOUR PERSPECTIVE SO. JUST IN THE CONTEXT ON FREE THE RECESSION. CALIFORNIA HAD. SOME VERY MINIMAL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN. OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT BUT WE DIDN'T EVEN ADD. THE WORD WE DIDN'T ADD TO OUR TO THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO WHAT YEAR WAS THAT ADDED SENATOR BILL DO YOU RECALL. OKAY BUT IT WAS IT WAS. BUT IT WAS OWN MORE. NO NO NO IT WAS MORE IN THE YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY IT WAS IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS SO WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO. SO WE DID NOT VIEW. OUR CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT AS A AS WE DO NOT VIEW THAT IT HAD A REHABILITATIVE PURPOSE UNTIL. AS LATE AS TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND THEN VERY QUICKLY THERE AFTER WE HIT THE RECESSION. AND WE PRETTY MUCH SLASHED THE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. SO WE DIDN'T REALLY START. REINVESTING IN REHABILITATION WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONS DIVISION UNTIL ABOUT. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT AND SO REALLY WE'VE NOT HAD GOOD INVESTMENT INTO A MUCH MORE RECENTLY. ADDITIONALLY. WHEN WE LOOK AT I MEAN SO WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS? DEPENDING ON ONE'S PERSPECTIVE BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT WE HOLD IN OUR STATE PRISONS GO HOME. THEY RETURN HOME AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER. AND SO. THE ONE VERY VALID PERSPECTIVE IS IF WE ARE. HOLDING PEOPLE FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO RETURN HOME INDEPENDENT OF OF TRYING TO KEEP RECIDIVISM LOW. WE OBVIOUSLY OUR JOB IS TO IS PUBLIC SAFETY. IS TO DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO WE WANT. ONCE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HELD IN OUR FACILITIES AND THEN RETURNED HOME. WE WE WANT TO HAVE DONE THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE. TO HAVE THEM. THRIVE AND BE ABLE TO RE ENTER IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SAFE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES OF OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AND BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THEM REALLY IN REINVESTED IN THEM IN REALLY A PRETTY MORE PRETTY SHORTER RECENT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S HARD WHILE THE LA -- NOT ELIO POLICIES. THE AN AUDITOR. HAS IDENTIFIED SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'LL HEAR ABOUT WHEN THEY AUDIT YOUR PRESENTS. IT'S HARD TO DO A REALLY GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NUMBER BECAUSE OF THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN INVESTING IN THEM. AND SO WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. PARTIALLY TODAY WAS TO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM PEOPLE WHO EITHER DELIVER THOSE PROGRAMS OR WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THE PROGRAMS TO GIVE US A LITTLE CONTEXT SO THAT THEN WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE AUDITOR IT'LL HELP US [inaudible] ON ASK HER QUESTIONS AND UNDERSTAND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BETTER AND THAT SORT OF THING OKAY. SO LET US BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE WHICH IS INCREASING AND MET IN MAPLE LITERACY B. C. P. SO THIS IS A CDC ARE WILL BE PRESENTING. AND WE HAVE. ERIC SWANSON OR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND RYAN SUZETTE WHO IS THE MISTER SWANSON'S OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES IN FISCAL SERVICES. BUT MR SERVICES ARE DIRECTOR. FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. MISTER SWANSON YOU WANNA START SURE. THANKS WATSON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES GOOD MORNING THE FIRST REQUEST TODAY IS. FOR FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY AT ABOUT THE SAME ON GOING. INTO EITHER FORT ILLITERACY MENTOR PROGRAM ACROSS ALL CDC OUR ADULT INSTITUTIONS. AS YOU MENTIONED WITH ME TODAY IS RYAN SOUSA OR DIVISION OF REBUILDING OF THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATION PROGRAMS TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS RYAN SEES I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR -- FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AS MISTER SWANSON DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. I'M IN GENERAL FUND AND THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS BEGINNING IN NINETEEN TWENTY TO ESTABLISH A LITERACY MENTOR PROGRAM ACROSS ALL CDC ARE DAHLE INSTITUTIONS. LITERACY CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION -- AND WE DEFINE IN THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THOSE OF THE LITERACY NEED AS ANYONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE. A HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY OR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THAT'S REALLY THE MEASURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET -- ALL INMATES TO PRIOR TO RELEASE. AT THE TIME OF THE PROPOSAL 53%. NINTH GRADE LEVEL. AND 62% OF INMATES I'M DID NOT POSSESS THE DOCUMENT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE WITHIN OUR DAHLE INSTITUTIONS. NOT PERCENT WAS 53% OF INMATES RIGHT ABOVE THE NINTH GRADE LEVEL BUT 62% DID NOT POSSESS A DOCUMENT AT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENCY. ESSENTIALLY MEANING THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF WORK TO DO AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR INMATES HAVE THAT LITERACY NEW NEED MATT BY THE DIVISION. THIS PROPOSAL STEMS FROM THOSE FACTS -- THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED LITERACY IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR CREATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REACH THE STUDENT POPULATION IN NEED. THIS PROPOSAL ESTABLISHES THE MENTOR PROGRAM WHICH IS LED BY AN ACADEMIC ACCREDITED TEACHER MENTORS WILL GO THROUGH ROBUST TRAINING INTERCEPT AND MENTORING PROGRAMS WHERE THEY WERE -- IN MY ALSO COMPLETION CREDITS AND ULTIMATELY IN GRAHAM. UPON FINAL COMPLETION DAHLE MAINTAIN PAID POSITIONS A COMPATIBLE RATE TO OTHER HIGHLY REQUESTED WORK ASSIGNMENTS. WELL THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO SUPPLANT ACCREDITED TEACHERS ARE FACE TO FACE INSTRUCTION WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF THE STUDENT POPULATION WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES CREATE. A PEER TO PEER PROGRAM THAT CAN HELP STUDENTS ACHIEVE THE LITERACY STABILITY AND SUCCESSFUL MITIGATING IMPACT OTHER REHABILITATIVE ARE JOB. I'M WHO WILL IN TURN HAVE TWENTY MEN. THE GROWTH IN THE ABILITY TO REACH THE STUDENT POPULATION IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL THIS PROPOSAL. THERE ARE TWO POINTS -- THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO BRING UP THAT OFFICE AFTER REHABILITATION WHICH IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MEASURE SUCCESS.-I'M AND THAT IS GONNA BE DONE THROUGH OUR TAPING COSTAS -- TESTING WHICH IS BASIC ARM LITERACY LEVELS THAT ARE TESTED THROUGHOUT PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO EDUCATIONAL ASSIGNMENTS. OTHERS USUALLY YOU'LL HEAR MASQUERADE LEVELS ONE THROUGH. NINE AND SO WILL BE MEASURING THOSE STUDENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS MENTOR PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING -- EDUCATIONAL LITERACY GAINES AND IN TERMS OF LEVELS AND ULTIMATELY WILL BE MEASURING HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS AND EQUIVALENCIES THAT THEY AREN'T AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE MEASURABLE COMBINATIONS PLUS LOOKING AT HOURS THAT THEY SPEND IN THE LITERACY PROGRAM. HOURS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACADEMIC MOVING WILL GIVE US A REALLY ROBUST -- ABILITY TO TO MEASURE SUCCESS IN THE PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE. IT WAS ONE FINAL THING THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP THAT I'M WAS MENTIONED IN THE PROPOSAL AND THE LA -- WILL BRING UP PROBABLY AS A CONCERN IS THE ABILITY -- TO SUPPLANT CBT I IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL THINKING AS PART OF THE COMPONENTS FOR THE MODULES. RELATED TO THIS LITERACY MENTOR PROGRAM THERE IS SOME CRIMINAL THINKING ON THIS GOING TO BE S. THAT WE WERE NOT PLANNING TO HAVE. THOSE CRIMINAL THINKING SLOTS THAT ARE DONE WITH OUR C. B. T. FACILITATORS. USED BY OUR IN MAY MENTORS THIS IS ESSENTIAL IDEA HERE IS THAT THEY G THROUGH SOME LEVEL OF CRIMINAL THINKING APPROXIMATELY ASSESSED FOR CRIMINAL THINKING. SO IF THEY TAKE IT WOULD NOT REQUIRE THEM TO TAKE IT AGAIN. THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT ASSESSED FOR CRIMINAL THINKING PART OF THE CURRICULUM IS BEING DEVELOPED AND LED BY THE ACADEMIC INSTRUCTORS WILL HAVE CRIMINAL THINKING COMPONENTS IN ONE OF THE MODULES FOR THE TRAINING. AND THEY WILL TAKE IT THERE SO THAT THEY'RE NOT -- IMPACTING OUR CPT. LOTS I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL. I KNOW THAT THE LA -- HAD. SOME CONCERNS THAT ARE IN OUR MATERIALS YOU WOULD LIKE. TO PROVIDE ANY THAT WOULD BE. THE CHRIS MORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- AS IS MENTIONED WE DID RAISE A FEW CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL -- AT IS THAT WAS MENTIONED BY CDC ALL ONE THE CONCERNED HAD BEEN THE C. B. T. -- COMPONENT IN ADDITION TO THAT DO THE UNTESTED NATURE OF THE PROGRAM WE ARE NOT ENTIRELY SURE THIS WOULD BE A COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM -- NOTABLY INMATE MENTORSHIP I HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THIS CONTEXT PREVIOUSLY. THAT WE RECOMMEND PURSUING THIS AS A PILOT PROGRAM. THE CIVIC I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY POINT ONE AND THE FOLLOWING YOUR WITH FIVE IN MAY. I AM INSTRUCTORS. THIS WOULD SUPPORT. A PILOT PROGRAM AT FIVE INSTITUTIONS WITH FIVE INSTRUCTORS ON A LIMB TERM BASIS FOR THREE HOURS. WE THINK THIS WOULD BE OF ENOUGH TIME TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE PROGRAM HAS. IMPACTED LITERACY GAINES. IN ADDITION WE PUT OUT THAT THE REASON IT'S DIFFERENT IN FUNDING LEVELS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THE FOLLOWING YOURS IS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THE IN IT MENTORS TO GET TRAINED. I'M GOING THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE PAID THE CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THAT TIME PERIOD THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION -- WHEN YOU INDICATE THAT? THERE'S NOT BEEN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS DID THE LA -- LOOK AT WHETHER ANY OTHER STATES. I USE AN INMATE MENTOR PROGRAM. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY IN A MENTAL PROGRAMS FOR IN THE GENERAL ACTUALLY RESEARCH IT WE LOOKED INTO IT WE DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY. OF COURSE M.. IT. A SUCH A PROGRAM COULD BE RELEVANT NOT ONLY IN THE STATE IT'S BILL ANYBODY IN COUNTY FACILITIES ALSO. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW EXHAUSTIVE [inaudible] THE AT SEARCH WAS. WHEN LOOKING TO THE PROGRAMS WE DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY I THOUGHT THE JAIL LEVEL OR IN THE PRESENCE [inaudible] RIGHT. SENATOR BILL YOUR QUESTION. CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU MEAN BY CRIMINAL THINKING. SO WHERE IS THE DEFINITION OF HELLO THINKING IS A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT ON IT. THAT WE CURRENTLY -- FACILITATE OUR CBT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO OF CRIMINAL THINKING IS -- BASICALLY A TREATMENT PROGRAM -- DESIGNED TO US AT OUR LEVELS OF CRIMINAL THINKING AND ULTIMATELY REACT TO THE CRIMINAL THINKING TO CHANGE THOSE. DYNAMIC CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS IT'S A PEOPLE THAT HAVE CRIMINAL THINKING. OR IS -- IS ACTUALLY A RANGE OF THINKING. THERE'S A REASON. YES ESSENTIALLY SO -- WHAT KIND OF -- ACTIONS YOU TAKE. IN SAY THESE PROGRAMS -- WITH SOMEBODY WITH CRIMINAL THINKING. TO CHANGE THEIR LEVEL OF CRIMINAL THINKING. MUCH OF THE CRIMINAL THINKING OPPONENTS LIKE EITHER COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT COMPONENTS ARE REALLY ADDRESSING THAT DYNAMIC COMMITTED GENIC FACTORS SO -- ASSESSING BOTH THAT THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL THINKING NEED GETTING THEM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. YOU AND THEN MAINTAIN -- BEHAVIORAL CHANGE OR SURROUND US THE ADDED VALUATIONS -- OF THE CRIMINAL THINKING. ARE THERE VALUATIONS OF WHO DOES IT. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A SPECIFIC EVALUATION COMMIT THINKING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CURRICULUM THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED ON AND I THINK SOME OF IT ACTUALLY IS IN THE QUEUE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE. THE NOW YOU OKAY ON REAL TO THE READING PROGRAM -- THE QUESTION I HAD WHEN I READ THIS WAS -- A LOT OF PROGRAMS IN OUR FACILITIES OR ESTABLISHED IN TERMS OF EDUCATION RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OTHER INSTITUTIONS -- COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERTISE. AND EDUCATING PEOPLE. ADULTS AND CHILDREN. THAT -- HAVE -- DEFICIENCIES AND READING. ERROR SPECIALIST THEIR TRAIN TEACHERS SPECIALISTS WITH CREDENTIALS. TO TAKE CARE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH THOSE KINDS OF READING PROBLEMS -- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOUR MODEL INVOLVES THAT. IS THAT TRUE. OUR CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM WORKS VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ORDER ABOUT THE READING PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THEY ARE ACCREDITED TEACHERS THAT WILL BE LEADING THIS AND WE ARE ALSO WALK ACCREDITED SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. SO THEY DO WORK VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THOSE AND THEIR EVIDENCE BASED PRINCIPLES THAT THEY'RE AND IMPLEMENTING WITH THESE PROGRAM MODULES IN TERMS OF I'M LOOKING AT WHAT WORKS AN EVIDENCE BASED PRINCIPLES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE HAVING A FORMAL STRUCTURE. MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE DOING FOLLOW UP THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE BUILT INTO OUR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE WALK ACCREDITATION AN ACCREDITED TEACHER. TERMS OF HOW THEY ACTUALLY WERE THEY HAVE SPECIAL CREDENTIALS. RELATIVE -- TO READING. OF EDUCATION CREDENTIALS. I DON'T BELIEVE OUR TEACHERS WERE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIALS THEY DO HAVE SINGLE AND MULTI LEVEL SUBJECT CREDENTIALS AND ARE CREDITED. INSTRUCTORS DO THEY DO HAVE A MEDICAL EDUCATIONAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION OTHER READING ISSUES. AND WHY THEY HAVE READING ISSUES STEPPING DOWN [inaudible] DURING A DOT A DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION. AS DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROBLEMS FOR READING METERS. WIDE RANGE OF REASONS WHY IT. PEOPLE ARE DEFICIENT IN REASON AND READING ABILITIES. ABSOLUTELY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENT OF IT BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE GIVE OUT THE TAPE -- WHICH IS THE TEST OF ADULT BASIC EDUCATION AND THE COST SAYS WHICH IS FEDERALLY DRIVEN THOSE ARE TASK THAT. ARE ABLE TO DIVE VERY DEEP INTO -- THE COMPONENTS OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING SO FOR INSTANCE WE GIVEN ACOSTA SETTLEMENT. THEY CAN GO DOWN TO THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL TO THAT OFFENDER AS OF NEEDS THEY HAVE MIGHT BE TELLING TIME OR SIMPLE MATH SO THE CEDIT HE TEACHERS CAN REALLY FOCUS. ON THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH THAT STUDENTS SO ACROSS THIS TAX IS A REALLY ROBUST ANALYSIS AND THE BACK END OF THAT SYSTEM PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL DATA FOR US TO BE REALLY FOCUS ON PEOPLE ON THEIR TARGETED NEEDS. SO ARE MEDICAL DOCTORS INVOLVED THESE EVALUATIONS. NOW NOT SAID NONE OF SOMETIMES THE REASONING BEHIND YOUR READING DIFFICULTIES INVOLVES CONDITIONS THAT ARE PICKED UP BY A MEDICAL DOCTORS -- AND IT'S QUITE COMMON ACTUALLY IT'S MORE COMMON ACTUALLY REALIZE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT CHILDREN AND ADULTS THEIR READING PROBLEMS ARE ACADEMIC TEACHERS AND I'M SORRY I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE QUESTION ACTUALLY OUR ACADEMIC TEACHERS DO LOOK AT MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE DONE -- TO DEDICATE STAFFING JUST TO THOSE WITH ABOVE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES SO THOSE ASSESSMENTS DONE BY MEDICAL ARE INCLUDED IN OUR STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGER THEY LOOK AT WHEN THEY SEE SOME OF THE READING PROBLEMS THAT THEY DO A READING MEDICAL ASSESSMENT TO SEE IF THEY HAVE. PROBLEMS WITH HER EYES -- THERE'S ALL KINDS OF REASONS I MEAN THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF REASONS YOU KNOW THAT THE BILL IN A BILL TO FOCUS. ON WORDS YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER REASON -- DYSLEXIA IS -- SPECTRUM. YEAH THERE'S ALL KINDS OF TYPE TO THAT -- THE GOVERNOR HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT HIMSELF HAVING IT HIMSELF YOU KNOW. ON IN A VERY HONEST -- VERY PROUD OF OUR GOVERNOR FOR DOING THAT. PEOPLE ARE -- VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS HE WANTS TO DO WITHOUT. AND SO I I I THINK THE DEBT. THE PART THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT NEEDS TO BE. EXPLAINED BETTER AND YOUR PROPOSAL [inaudible] OKAY -- THEN ENTERS A MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS. ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT LAKE BEFORE AND AFTER READING SCORES PROGRESS [inaudible] TESTING OF HER EYES TESTING KIND OF PROCESSES. YES TO ALL OF THE VERGE OF READING OKAY -- THERE'S SOME. IN TERMS OF READING -- THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY IS NOW AVAILABLE. OF OF PEOPLE -- REHABILITATE THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF THEIR DISABILITY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE -- REGARDING READING SO THERE'S A LOT OF NEW -- TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN INVENTED -- IN TERMS OF IS IS A MATTER OF LIKE IN A LOT OF CASES TRAINING THAT HIGH. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO READ SOMETHING [inaudible] AND IS THAT PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL FOR THE READING LITERACY. PART OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY IS MACHINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IS -- WE HAVE A SEPARATE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DISABILITY. REPLACEMENT ITEMS TO HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE READING IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR VISION ARE STRUGGLING WITH A TIME BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENT IT -- TECHNOLOGY BASED THINGS LIKE READING HORIZONS OR AZTEC WHICH ARE PROGRAMS.% ACTIVELY ACHIEVE LITERACY BY LEVERAGING COMPUTERS AND GIVING PEOPLE AN ADDITIONAL STRUCTURED TIME -- SURROUNDING THOSE ITEMS SO -- THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND THEY ARE -- KIND OF A SUPPLEMENT PLAYING -- YOU'RE GOING TO USE. THOSE. TOOLS AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. THAT IN TERMS OF GOALS OF OF OF AND THEN IN TERMS OF HOW WE PRIORITIZE. THE PROGRAM LIKE. HOW DO YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ATTACKING? SEVERITY -- OF READING PROBLEMS OR YOU JUST DOING -- IN A GENERAL WAY. THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE WORST PROBLEMS. OR YOU DON'T IN A GENERAL WAY. HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING RIGHT NOW -- OUR MAIN FOCUS IS THOSE THAT HAVE HIGHER LITERACY LEVELS THAT ARE KIND OF MEETING THAT I'VE TARGETED FOCUS THAT THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED RELATIVELY QUICKLY. THAT LEAVES MORE TIME FOR OUR CREDIT ACADEMIC INSTRUCTORS TO FOCUS ON THOSE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF LITERACY. WE'RE NOT XCLUDING THE LOWER LEVEL LITERACY AS PART OF THE PROGRAM'S REALLY IS MENTORS ARE NOT INTENDED TO SUPPLANT. I'M EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTORS WHICH ARE REALLY CRITICAL IN GETTING PEOPLE'S LOWER LEVEL LITERACY IS UP TO A HIGHER LEVEL. AS THE WERE FOCUSED ON THE HIGHER LEVEL MORE ALSO FOCUSED ON THOSE WOULD BE CLOSEST TO A RELEASE SO THAT PEOPLE WITH A COUPLE OF YEARS ORA YEAR OR MONTHS. CAN HAVE SOME TARGETED INSTRUCTION BEFORE. OKAY -- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PROPOSAL EXPLAINS THAT GOOD ENOUGH I THINK. ONE OF ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS. YOU KNOW I ALWAYS I ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE IF YOU'RE. IS KIND OF LIKE SPECIAL ED HERE IS WHAT WE'RE DONE WITH -- DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THE MOST SEVERE IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD THING TO DO. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED TO DO IT SO I I I KIND OF HOPE THAT YOU. WE'LL THINK ABOUT. HOW YOU MAKE YOUR PRIORITIES AND NOT JUST -- HELLO THE MODERATES AND AS OPPOSED TO SERVE YEARS IN TERMS OF READING READING DIFFICULTY THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE. IT SEEMS INTUITIVE THAT -- THEIR READING SKILLS. I'M. BUT TO HAVE. I I DIDN'T. LIKE SEE A STUDY THAT KIND OF A FIRM THAT I REMEMBER THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM BUT DO WE HAVE ANY. STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT A READING LITERACY PROGRAM IS USED. IN A STATE AND HERE WERE THE RESULTS OVER A PERIOD TIME. I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC STUDY TO REFERENCE FOR THE LITERACY PROGRAM BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS THAT EXIST OUT THERE -- AND I I BELIEVE THERE'S ONE STATE THAT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS AN ENTIRE INMATE DRIVEN TEACHING SYSTEM FROM ACTUAL EDUCATION TO VOCATIONAL PART OF WHAT WE KNOW HERE. IS THE BASE FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF LITERACY OR THAT ACHIEVED THAT HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA WILL DO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED IN TERMS OF OR SAID ABOUT THEM WE HAD SOME INITIAL NUMBERS. I'M THAT ARE STILL PRELIMINARY THERE'S A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHICS THAT HAVE TO BE ANALYZED AROUND IT BUT FOR THOSE -- PEOPLE THAT WERE RELEASED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT HAD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE. THEIR RECIDIVISM ONE YEAR CONVICTION RATE WAS ABOUT NINE POINT 5%. WHEN YOU LOOK AT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHICH IS A TO RELATIONS ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE IT'S EIGHTEEN POINT 3% SO ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES THERE'S MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITH THAT'S INITIALLY SAYING IS? THERE'S NEARLY A 50% DROP IN ACTIONS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE THOSE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS WORK OF ONE SEES. IT'S VERY PRELIMINARY WE NEED TO DO MORE ABOUT IT BASICALLY SUPPORTS THE FACT IN THERE'S A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES OUT THERE FROM RAND. TO OTHER PLACES AS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE THOSE OF THE WAYS TO TARGET PEOPLE BEFORE THE RELEASE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL TO THEM. IF SOMEBODY HAS -- A CVT NEED OR VOCATIONALLY BUT THEY CAN ACTUALLY READ THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP THEM AS MUCH SO REALLY HAVING THIS ACADEMIC LITERACY SUPPORT IS CRITICAL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE BASED PRINCIPLES. AND DATA SURROUNDING IT TO SAY GETTING PEOPLE FOR THIS EDUCATIONAL LITERACY LEVELS REALLY IMPORTANT. SO WHILE YOU'RE ANSWERING CENTER BELLS QUESTIONS I JUST LOOK UP ON MY IPHONE BUT CAST. PROGRAMS ARE STUDIES ROUTE THERE IN WHAT CAME UP WHEN I KEYED IN A FEW KEY WORDS. WAS A A SITE CALLED PRISON FELLOWSHIP. WHICH AS A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WHERE. PEOPLE CAN COME AND HELP EACH. INMATES HOW TO READ I'M JUST WONDERING DO WE TAP INTO A VOLUNTEER BASIS SPECIALLY WITH THE A SENIOR RETIREE POPULATION IS GROWING. I KNOW THATWE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS THAT COME IN BOTH ON THEIR OWN INTER INNOVATIVE GRANTS. I DO. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OFF THE TOP MAN BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO GET YOU SOME INFORMATION ON WHETHER WE HAVE. EDUCATIONAL. HERE STUDENT TUTORS I KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS I'M JUST YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO AND VISIT AN INSTITUTION OFTEN ARE. MATERIALS DESCRIBED. AND NUMBER OF THE VOLUNTARY ON THE THE VOLUNTEER EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ALSO DESCRIBED A BILL. WHICH I ESTABLISH THEM UNDER SENATOR HANCOCK SO THERE ARE I DON'T KNOW ROBUST. GREEN I AM [inaudible] STILL AT CORRECTIONS ONE A ONE SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS I'M TRYING TO LEARN ABOUT HOW MANY SO WE DO HAVE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE PRISONS AND INDIVIDUALS. SO HOW DO WE MERGE THE VOLUNTEERS WITH. THE THIRTY FIVE POSITIONS THAT YOU'RE. TRYING TO ADD. I THINK THIS IS A DISTINCT PROGRAM BUT THOSE VOLUNTEERS CREATE A CULTURE THAT WE FULLY SUPPORT I THINK IT CONTINUES TO HELP. THE BASIC CONCEPTS AS WE HAVE IF WE SAY WE HAVE 62% OF PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENCY. IN OUR INSTITUTIONS THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE -- AND THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM TO GROW SO I THINK I'LL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THESE THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMBINING BIRTH APPROPRIATELY -- BUT THEY REALLY CAN STILL STAND ON THEIR OWN I BELIEVE AND ACHIEVE WHAT WE WANT WHICH IS GETTING PEOPLE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SEE PRIOR TO RELEASE. AND THEN. HOW DO YOU ASKED BECAUSE READING IS WANTING COMPREHENSION IS ANOTHER? IS THIS ORDER. COME OUT OF THE THE THE READING HORIZONS PROGRAM DO THEY KIND OF THE KIND OF GREAT OR ANALYZE HOW. SOMEONE IS IMPROVING HE'S BEEN. ON THEIR READING SKILLS IN THE RETENTION SKILLS. OUR OUR BASIC ASSESSMENTS ARE DONE THROUGH OUR TAPING COSTS. WHICH ARE STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS OUR INSTRUCTORS GIVE OUT AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT IN BOTH READING HORIZONS AND ASKED TECH -- AS PEOPLE ANSWER QUESTIONS THEY RE FOCUS ON THOSE TARGETS BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED THINGS OR OFFER UP SOLUTIONS THANKS TO FOCUS ON SO ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE USE -- GO BACK TO WHAT TARGETED NEEDS MIGHT BE THERE AND THEN ARE STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT THERE WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO USE IN TERMS OF GRADE LEVEL GROWTH. IS THERE A COMPONENT OF SAY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THIS OP OR THAT KIND OF HIS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALREADY WAY BEYOND LEVEL WE NEED TO MOVE YOU UP WITH A HIGHER. IT WOULD IT WOULD DISPLAY IN OUR WHERE WE REALLY FOCUSED BUT IF THEY WERE DOING A SOFTWARE SO READING HORIZONS FOR INSTANCE IS USUALLY PEOPLE BETWEEN. A GRADE LEVEL -- OF ZERO TO FOURTH GRADE AND SO IT REALLY FOCUSES ON THOSE OF THOSE LOWER LITERACY LEVELS AND IF THEY WERE SEEING ACADEMIC GROWTH -- IMPROVEMENT AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER F HOURS THEY WOULD GET REASSESS THROUGH OUR TABOR COSTS THIS TEST AND THEN THEY WOULD BE PLACED INTO A HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAM BASED ON THAT TEACHER. REVIEWING BUT THOSE TEST SCORES AND THEIR ACADEMIC GRASS. AND THIS VOTE HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS BACK TO ONE A ONE HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS CAN YOU SIGN UP [inaudible] FOR THE A WHOLE LOT BUT BASS FIRE FIRE. TRAINING. CAN AND HOW MANY CAN YOU SIGN UP. FOR ONE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LIMIT ON SIGNING UP FOR PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT. WHAT THE SCHEDULE LOOKS LIKE IN THE ABILITY FOR THE -- AND MADE ACTUALLY ATTEND A FIRE CAMP YOU COULD BE IN THAT PROGRAM AND BE A MAN OR FOR THE READING. I IMAGINE THAT THE THE READING PROGRAM AS WERE ROLLING IT OUT THAT HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THINGS LOCATED IN THE PRISON -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE OUR OF VOLUNTARY EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH IS ARE ACCREDITED INSTRUCTORS THAT HELP OUT OF FIRE CAMPS. GREAT THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LACKEY SO I'M. I AM A NUMBER QUESTION FIRST. ON THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR BILL ASK AROUND THE CRIMINAL PERSONALITY THERAPY. IN OUR OWN. AND IT YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW THIS. IT INDICATES THAT IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE WAS A ESTIMATION OF ABOUT 41%. OR FORTY FOUR THOUSAND OFFENDERS WERE ASSESSED YOU HAVE A MODERATE TO HIGH NEED FOR CRIMINAL PERSONALITY THERAPY. THAT WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE. THAT THERE'S BEEN WELL PERHAPS NOT A FULL ON ASSESSMENT OF ALL INMATES. SOME LEVEL OF ASSESSMENT OF A GOOD PROPORTION OF VIDEO DIDN'T SEEM TO INDICATE THAT. I MIGHT HAVE I MIGHT HAVE. NOT BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH. SO WHEN. WHEN ANY IN MAY COMES IN TWO THE DCR THE RECEPTION CENTER AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT ONE OF THE EXCLUSIONARY GREATER THEY WILL GET A COMPASS ASSESSMENT? WHICH ASSESSES THEIR DYNAMIC COMMISSION IT NEEDS ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS IS CRIMINAL THINKING WHAT YOU'RE READING IS PROBABLY -- WHAT THAT IS FROM WHICH IS ABOUT OUR STATE INSTITUTION THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY ASSESSED AS A MODERATE TO HIGH FOR CRIMINAL? SO ASA HIGH NEED FOR CRIMINAL PERSONALITY THERAPY YES. INTERCHANGEABLE SO SO I'M SORRY WELL GIVEN THAT. YOUR PROPOSAL THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL. SAYS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE THIS THERE BE TO EVERY INMATE WHO WAS PART OF THIS MENTOR PROGRAM SO THAT WOULD. BE INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER THEY WERE IT MODERATE TO HIGH NEED GIVEN THAT. I MEAN THAT I THINK THE ALEJO'S POINT THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. IS LEGITIMATE WHY WOULDN'T YOU ONLY REQUIRE THAT FOR THOSE WHO WERE. ASSESSED AT MODERATE TO HIGH NEED. SO THOSE THAT WERE ASSESSED MOTOR TINY WILL ALREADY BE A PART OF THE C. B. T. PROGRAM WHICH IS. WHAT WE'RE READING INDICATES NOT EVERYONE IS RECEIVED THAT SO I DID SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T PROVIDE IT FOR EVERYBODY AT ONCE? SO CLEARLY IT'S YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BACKLOG. SO WHY WOULD YOU REQUIRE IT. FOR THOSE IN YOUR MENTOR PROGRAM WHO ARE NOT ASSESSED AT MODERATE TO HIGH. THOSE IN THE PROGRAM THAT WERE NOT AS FAST AS A MODERATE I NEED WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PART OF THE C. B. T. PROGRAM THAT EXCESS. WEIGHT THEY ARE AS PART OF THE CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION WITH THE VOLUNTARY EDUCATION. GOING TO BE TAUGHT CRIMINAL THINKING OPPONENTS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POPULATION THAT THEY MAY BE INTERACTING WITH HAVE A CRIMINAL THINKING ASSESSMENT. SO A LOT OF IT WAS ATTACKED I WANT TO SAY LIKE A TRAIN THE TRAINER APPROACH HAVING THEM UNDERSTAND THOSE CRIMINAL THINKING BEHAVIORS WILL ALSO HELP THEM INTERACT WITH POSSIBLY THE VOLUNTARY STUDENTS. NOW IF THEY ALREADY ARE SETTLED IT'S NOT WRITTEN THAT WAY RIGHT SO YOU NEED TO NOW IF THERE. I WILL WE WILL CLARIFY BUT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL. I'M ALL RIGHT SO NEXT POINT -- BACK TO MISTER SENATOR BELLS POINTS ABOUT. AN ADEQUATE ASSESSMENT TO LEARN HOW TO READ. IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE UNDERLYING ISSUES OF SAY VISION. OR SOMETHING ON THE SPECTRUM OF LEX YES. WE'RE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS THAT. COULD IMPEDE ONE'S ABILITY TO READ. THAT HAS TO BE IDENTIFIED BEFORE. pOUT OF TEN TO ASSIST SOMEONE TO BE ABLE -- TO LEARN HOW TO READ. SO IF THAT HASN'T BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND WE HAVE MENTORS BRING TO HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO READ. WE CAN CREATE A VERY FRUSTRATING CIRCUMSTANCE BOTH FOR THE INMATE. WHO IS TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO READ AND THE AND THE INMATE WAS MEANT BRING THEM? IF THAT UNDERLYING SO YOU DESCRIBE A THING WHERE YOU THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS CAN DISCOVER FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER. YOU SAID TO ME ABOUT RECOGNIZING NUMERALS FOR TELLING TIME I THINK WAS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE. WELL THAT COULD BE IDENTIFIED. WHAT IF THAT'S SAY ON THE DYSLEXIC SPARE ROOM? UNLESS IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT IS WHY VERSUS JUST THAT. NO ONE EVER MADE THAT CORRELATION THE FOR THEN JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT TO SOMEONE HITS A NUMBER. THEY'RE NOT LEARNING. RIGHT SO WHAT TYPE OF PRE DIAGNOSIS IS DONE. SO THAT WE CAN. ENSURE THAT WHAT EVER. WE'RE OFFERING TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT YET AT NINETY THREE READING LEVELS [inaudible] WORKS. SO I I WILL ANSWER IN GENERALITIES AND I WILL GIVE YOU MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION THERE ARE ASSESSMENT THEY'RE DONE BY MEDICAL UP FRONT THIS SIZE. I PEOPLE'S RELIABLE THAT THAT HAPPENS AND OUR TEACHERS USE THAT INFORMATION ADDITIONALLY. ALL OF OUR ACCREDITED TEACHERS ARE TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE THOSE ISSUES NOW THEY'RE IN THEIR INCLUDED IN THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS REPORTS AN ACADEMIC NOTES FOR THE STUDENT IN OUR SYSTEM. I'LL GET MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT EXACTLY THAT TRAINING LOOKS LIKE BUT WE DO HAVE ALL OF OUR TEACHERS ARE CREDITED AND THEY ARE ON ABLE TO DISCERN SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU THAT'S REFERENCE SO THAT. THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FACILITATING THE RIGHT STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT AND LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE STUDENT. FOR THE MENTOR FOR OFF FOR EVERYBODY THAT THEY'RE INTERACTING WITH SO THEY WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN. IN. PLANS TO LAY OUT THE TEACHER WOULD BE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THOSE MENTORS WHO ARE LOOK WORKING WITH THE MENTEES AND THE TEACHER WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THOSE MEN TEASE. THOSE STUDENT RECORDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RECOGNIZING ANY OF THOSE NEEDS YOUR AVAILABLE OR THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO MAKE UP FOR I'M. THE THE OTHER. ANOTHER POINT THAT I WANTED. TO YES I KNOW. BUT IN ORDER IS WE DIDN'T GET THE YEAH. OKAY. I'M. BERMAN FINANCE DID YOU HAVE ANY THING YOU ONE DAD. WHICH MARIN APARTMENT FINANCE WANT TO NOTE THAT WE SEE THIS AS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO REACH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INMATES. ON THE LA -- MAN MENTIONED A RAMP UP PERIOD AND BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT RAMP UP HERE IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO ROLL THE PROGRAM OUT WE THINK PILOTING IT WILL JUST TO LIKE TO AVOID -- ALL RIGHT I'M. I WILL SEE IF CENTER MORE LIKE WHAT. MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THERE A WAY TO QUANTIFY. I GOT. THE RESULTS. IMPROVE READING SKILLS IS THERE ARE SOME. THROUGH SOME WAY THAT THE RECIDIVISM GOES DOWN WHICH THEN THEREFORE RESULTS IN LAST. INCARCERATION WHICH TRANSLATES INTO THE FOLLOWING DOLLARS SO THAT WERE SPENDING A DIME TO MAKE A QUARTER. WE HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WELL. WE'VE THE DEPARTMENT TWENTY COLLECTING A NUMBER OF THOSE -- OUTCOME MEASURES WE CAN SEE THE EFFECT OF THE PROGRAM ON LITERACY RATES AND THEN WE CAN -- EXTRAPOLATE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR RECIDIVISM BUT THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THAT EVALUATION AND THEN. WE COULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO A HYPOTHETICAL A DOLLAR AMOUNT BASED ON HOW MUCH WE THINK THIS WILL IMPACT RECIDIVISM BUT YES THAT IS THE IDEA THAT THIS WILL -- GET A BIG BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN TERMS OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM QUICKLY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTRE BELL. I JUST HAD ANOTHER QUESTION -- WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED THAT ARE -- THEIR ENGLISH. IS NOT YOUR MAIN LANGUAGE AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT -- NATURE OF YOUR PROGRAM RELATIVE TO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING. INMATES AND WHETHER OR NOT THE SAME. LEVEL OF PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO PLAY APPLY TO THEM VERSUS ENGLISH SPEAKING. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THIS PROGRAM FOR THE? THE BILINGUAL -- OR ARE THEY ARE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING OF SAID NON ENGLISH SPEAKING [inaudible] IMAGE. OUR OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION -- RIGHT NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THERE'S THERE'S NOT BEEN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT ASSESSES PEOPLES -- SECONDARY LANGUAGE LEVEL SO RIGHT NOW WE LOOK AT THOSE READING BELOW THE FOURTH GRADE LEVEL FOR THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. AND THERE'S ABOUT SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE RIGHT NOW. THE THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT IS WE ARE -- PROPOSING AND IMPLEMENTING A TAPE CLASS THE EXAM WHICH FOCUSES ON YES CELL AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO BETTER IDENTIFY AND NOW IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS. IF THERE'S A VOLUNTARY NATURE THAT THEIR PARTY FOR OUR TEACHERS WILL BE WORKING TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO BEST FACILITATE -- THAT INSTRUCTION THAT'S THE IDEA OF BEING REALLY COLLABORATIVE WITH THESE VOLUNTARY EDUCATION MENTORS AND CONSTRUCTION -- THAT'S HAPPENING ALREADY IN THE FIELD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR TAG TO THE RIGHT MENTOR TIED TO THE RIGHT TEACHER. BUT WE ARE ALSO IMPLEMENTING THAT TAPE CLASSY EXAMPLE. TO BETTER HELP US ASSESS WHO HAS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE ISSUES. WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AT ALL AGES? THEY DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. FOR THOSE -- I DON'T I HAVE TO GO BACK AND AND SEE WELL I JUST SAY YOUR PROGRAM DOES NOT DESCRIBE. THE ISSUE ADEQUATELY I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT. DESCRIBE A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY SO THAT WE CAN. BE SURE THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR LANGUAGES THERE ARE THE PROGRAM WILL TREAT THEM EQUALLY SELECT. WERE ALL LANGUAGES. THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AFTER THE GUM. DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY INMATES IN OUR SYSTEM. DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH AT ALL. I DO NOT HAVE THAT THE TOP I DON'T KNOW MEANS OF CAN MAYBE TELL US OF THEY THINK IN TERMS OF LEARNING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEARN FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST. THE EXISTING ENGLISH. I THANK YOU SENATOR OVER FOR ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- I ATE A I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES BUT I WANTED -- TO INDICATE THAT MY QUESTIONS WEREN'T NECESSARILY. I DON'T WANT THEM TRIGGERED THAT I WOULD OPPOSE THIS PROGRAM BUT RATHER I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SET UP A SITUATION WHERE EITHER THE MENTOR OR THE INMATE IS THERE'S A THAT WE CREATED MORE FRUSTRATION AND LESS SUCCESS BECAUSE WE'VE NOT DONE ASSESSMENTS PROPERLY -- WE HAVEN'T AND THE TRAINING. I MEAN I THINK THAT. NOW. THAT WE AS A STATE UNDERSTAND THAT REHABILITATION IS AN ESSENTIAL THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF OUR SEIZE YOUR SYSTEM. MUCH MORE ROBUST PROGRAMS. IN LITERACY AND EDUCATION. IN -- ROB TRAINING IN IN ALL IN MANY MANY ASPECTS OF THINGS THAT SOME OF US MAY HAVE. YOU KNOW BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO ACQUIRE EARLIER IN OUR LIFE. BUT YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE MUST BE VERY ROBUST PART OF OUR ENTIRE CORRECTION SYSTEM AND THEY STILL AS WE KNOW OR NOT WE'VE MADE. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS THERE OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S NOT YET REAL ROBUST. AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YES WE AS WE EXPAND PROGRAMS AT THEIR IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE. POSSIBLE SO I WANT TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMENT. ANYONE ON THIS SIDE OF OKAY. SEEING NONE. WE WILL -- MOVE ONWERE NOT ACTING ON THE ITEMS THAT WILL OFFICE TO GET MORE INFORMATION FOR WHEN WE COME BACK -- WHEN WE VISITED AGAIN? AND ACT ON THE B. C. P.. SO THE NEXT ITEM THAT WILL NOW MOVE TO IS OUR INFORMATIONAL PANEL. ON WHAT WE CALL THE PRISONS COMMUNITY PIPELINE WE CALLED IT THAT BECAUSE AS I POINTED OUT -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR FOLKS THAT ARE. INCARCERATED. WILL BE RETURNING HOME. AND SO. WHAT WHAT IS THE STATUS NOW IN THIS OF COURSE IS NAP SHOT? THIS IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS YOU KNOW EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH OR EXHAUSTIVE. OVERVIEW OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN OUR SYSTEM BUT RATHER. IT IT IT'S UP THE PURPOSE OF THIS INFORMATIONAL PANELISTS TO GIVE US SOME SENSE. OF THE VALUE NON VALUE PRESENTS NON PRESENCE AND NEED -- FOR THINGS WITHIN OUR STATE FACILITIES TO HELP US. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY. PRISON TO COMMUNITY PIPELINE SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE SPEAKERS COME TO THE TABLE. WE HAVE OUR NINE CON WHO IS THE CO FOUNDER OF RESTORE JUSTICE AND WHO WAS ALSO FORMALLY INCARCERATED PERSON. HAVE KEITH WHAT LEE WHO IS THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNCOMMON Là. UNCOMMON Là PROVIDE -- LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO FOLKS. BEFORE AND DURING THEIR WHEN THEY'RE PRESENTED BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD AND COMMON LAW MAY DO ADDITIONAL THINGS BUT THAT IS THE WHAT I AM MOST FAMILIAR WITH -- BUT AS A RESULT OF PROVIDE ALL TO FOLKS BEFORE THEY GO TO THE PRO BOARD. ON THE FOLKS THAT WORK WITH UNCOMMON Là OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF REACTION WITH PEOPLE WITHIN OUR INCARCERATED SYSTEM. SO. I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN [inaudible] YOUR PREFERENCES. GOOD MORNING MADAM WHAT LIKE. I'LL I'LL START US OFF HERE -- I AM KEITH WILEY FROM ON COMMON LAW AND WHAT WE DO. PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE GOING THROUGH OUR DISCRETIONARY PAROLE PROCESS WHICH RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY IMPACTS. MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA PRISONERS. MOST OF WHAT WE DO IS LONG BEFORE SOMEONE APPEARS BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARDS AND IN THE WAY OF COUNSELING -- AND HELPING TO GUIDE THEIR THEIR PUNIC EFFORTS INSIDE AND MR OILY BEFORE YOU GO COULD YOU -- JUST SAY LITTLE MORE ABOUT WE'RE ON COMING LAWS BASED AND AND RIGHT AND THEN. DESCRIBE IT'S OUR OFFICE IS IN OAKLAND. AND WE'RE A NONPROFIT -- THAT WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS. FOR ALMOST THIRTEEN YEARS NOW. WE HAVE WORKED WITH OF THEM. THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THIS DISCRETION APRIL PROCESS. BOTH IN -- INDIVIDUAL MATTERS REPRESENTING THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND IN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY LITIGATED AGAINST. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND INCLUDING THE WE'RE NO LONGER INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AT THIS POINT -- THAT THAT THAT HAS BEEN WRAPPED UP WHICH I THINK HAS HELPED -- OPEN UP DIALOGUE FRANKLY BETWEEN US AND THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS AS WE HAVE. GAINED A LOT OF PERSPECTIVE. ARM ABOUT HOW. THE PROBOARDS VIEWED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE INSIDE -- AND I THINK THAT CAN INFORM CONVERSATION BETWEEN US AND THE BOARD ADMINISTRATION AND AND AS LONG AS THE ADMINISTRATION IS INCLUDED. OF MISS SHAFER WHO'S THE CURRENT EXECUTIVE OFFICER -- WE'VE NOTICED THE A CHANGE IN HOW THEY OPERATE IN TERMS OF BEING MORE TRANSPARENT AND WILLING TO FIND WAYS -- TO REALLY TACKLE SOME REALLY DIFFICULT TIME -- SO I APPRECIATE HER -- OPENNESS TO TO OUR OUR INPUT -- AND WORKING WITH US. THE UNCOMMON Là STARTED WHERE IN YOUR STAFF FOR MOSTLY WHAT. WE OWE. WELL I FOUNDED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIX IN OAKLAND AND WE ARE STAFF WE HAVE A SMALL STAFF OF SIX PEOPLE. N.. WE HAVE LAWYERS SOCIAL WORKERS -- WE HAVE -- PEOPLE FORMING CARS RATED WHO WORK WITH US AND DO THE SAME KIND OF COUNSELING AND SUPPORT THAT WE THAT THE REST OF THE TEAM DOES. WE ALSO HAVE ABOUT TWO DOZEN -- VOLUNTEERS IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REACH AS MANY AS WE DO -- AND THEY ARE MADE UP OF LAWYERS A OTHER THERAPISTS -- AND TOGETHER WE WE REACH -- QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WE'VE HAD -- A COUPLE HUNDRED OF OUR CLIENTS. WHO WERE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES BE RELEASED THROUGH THE DISCRETIONARY PROBOSCIS AND WE? WE DO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WE HAVE A RECIDIVISM RATE BELOW 1% -- SO WE WE FOUND THAT. WHAT WE DO SEEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY EAGER -- TO CONTINUE REGION AS MANY AS WE CAN -- WITH TO MAKE THIS MODEL AVAILABLE TO A LOT MORE PEOPLE -- I'D I PERSONALLY -- A FIRST WAS A A I'M HONORED TO BE SAID HERE NEXT TO MISTER KHAN BECAUSE I THINK IN A LOT OF WAYS THE PERSPECTIVE HE CAN PROVIDE IS ONE THAT IS JUST -- ONE MOST OF US DON'T HEAR OFTEN ENOUGH AND AND WILL PLAY A REALLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SHAPING -- THE PROGRAMMATIC OFFERINGS WITHIN INSTITUTIONS GOING FORWARD -- AND I KNOW THAT WITH THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE WAS IN SAN QUENTIN. ALSO THERE'S THE MUCH BETTER BLUE ON HIM I WILL SAY -- IN. AND I THINK BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS WHAT'S POSSIBLE WEN PEOPLE ARE BY THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE SUPPORT -- BE SUCCESSFUL -- I MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- DOES HELP ME BE HERE -- AND MY IN WITHIN MY OWN FAMILY I'VE SEEN THE THE MULTI GENERATIONAL IMPACT OF UNRESOLVED TRAUMA OF INCARCERATION. OUR END RELEASE WITHOUT SOME KEY SUPPORTS BEING IN PLACE. MY OWN SISTER SPENT ABOUT. MOST OF TWENTY YEARS IN JAILS AND PRISONS GLAZER PRETTY LONG STRETCHES AND WHEN SHE WOULD COME HOME. SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY BETTER SENSE OF HOW SHE ENDED UP THERE. AND SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT. THERE WAS NO COUNSELING THOSE THERAPY NO SUPPORT FOR HER TO ANSWER THE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW. HER OWN CHILDHOOD. EXPERIENCES -- IMPACT HER DECISIONS IN OUR ACTIONS -- AND IT TOOK ME SHE WAS SHE WAS -- IN THE AND FORTIES BEFORE SHE REALLY CONNECTED TO SOME WORK I WAS DOING. AND SO I I STE I KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND I I SEE HOW THAT IMPACTS HER KIDS AND HER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR KIDS. AND SO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON REALLY PROVIDING THE KIND OF COUNSELING AND AND SUPPORT THAT THAT SHE NEVER HAD. AND I FIND THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S SO MUCH NEEDED INSIDE THE INSTITUTION OF PEOPLE REALLY HUNGRY. FOR I WILL SAY THE WHAT I FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON -- ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO. ARE COMING FROM LIFE SENTENCES AND AND AND AND FOCUS ON A POPULATION. FOR THIS CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE WORK THEY HAVE TO DO. IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE PAROLE BOARD THERE NO LONGER WAS THE PUBLIC SAFETY. IS WORK THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DO. THEY HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEIR OWN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES IMPACT THEIR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. LED TO LET THEM HURT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS IF YOU DON'T RESOLVE THOSE THINGS WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON THEY CAN'T COME HOME. SO WHEN THEY DO COME HOME HAVING DONE THAT WORK. I THINK THEY ARE THE ARE THE KEY. TO REALLY DISRUPTING VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- THEY PLAY REALLY CRITICAL ROLE AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE EMPLOYMENT ACT PASSED. AND EVEN MOTHER INSIDE THE PRISON. THEY PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE. IN -- PROVIDING MENTOR SHIP GUIDANCE SUPPORT TO OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO TRAIN TRYING TO TRAVEL THE SAME ROUTE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE SAME ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. AND SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT -- IS A GREAT POTENTIAL IN THIS THINGS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE. HAVING -- WORK WITH SO MANY PEOPLE INSIDE THE PRISON OF IDENTIFIED. SOME SOME ASPECTS OF SOME OF THE BETTER -- PROGRAMS INSIDE INSTITUTIONS -- AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH WITH -- WITH THIS COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE THE KEY PIECES THAT WE FIND IS THAT -- WHEN WE START A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE? YOU KNOW THE THE WORST CHILD EXPERIENCING A REMEMBER. AND THEY MAY START TO OPEN UP ABOUT THAT. AND WE STE MAY SPEND OUR COUPLE HOURS WITH THEM AND THEN I GO BACK TO MY OFFICE. AND THEN THERE LEFT IN THE PRISON. WHERE THEY HAVE A GREAT A SUCCESS IS WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE COMMUNITY? WITHIN THE INSTITUTION THAT SUPPORTS THAT INQUIRY. GIVES THEM THE SPACE TO BE VULNERABLE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS SUPPORTS THEM DOESN'T JUDGE THEM DOESN'T SHARE THAT INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE ART. OF THOSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT SEEM TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THOSE THE ONES THAT -- THEY GO BEYOND -- THINGS LIKE ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS AND NARCOTICS. ANONYMOUS WHICH SIDE THE PRISONS ARE ANYTHING BUT ANONYMOUS -- N.. IN AND THEY GO INTO THESE THAT THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT MANY OF UNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- BUT THE ONES THAT DO THIS DEEPER DEEPER DIVE INTO SOMEONE'S HOME. HISTORY AND AND AND LIFE EXPERIENCES -- BUT I FOUND THAT THOSE THAT THOSE PRISONS THAT HAVE A SUPPORTIVE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY. WHERE THIS WHAT CAN HAPPEN? IS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE GREATEST SUCCESS -- IN THERE AREN'T ENOUGH OF THOSE -- THE THE ONE WITH SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF MASLOW HIERARCHY OF NEEDS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AT THE BASIC AT THE BOTTOM LEVELS THERE'S JUST BASIC. BASIC NEEDS OF OUR FOOD SHELTER WATER SAFETY. YOU CAN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT MUCH ELSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS HANDLED. N. AT THE HIGH SECURITY LEVEL PRISONS AND THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE A THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY. THE THE THE MAIN FOCUS IS NOT OUR SURVIVE TODAY. A YOU CAN'T THINK BEYOND HOW TO MY CHILDHOOD IMPACT MY DECISION YOU DON'T GET TO THAT POINT. SO -- YOU GOTTA HAVE YOU GOTTA BE IN A SAFE PLACE AND AND THAT TAKES. ON A SHARED AGREEMENT I THINK. AMONG THE PEOPLE INCARCERATED AND THE STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION. THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE. FOR TO DO THIS WORK WE'RE NOT JUST HERE TO WAREHOUSE AND WE'RE NOT JUST HERE TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. WE HERE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ENDED UP HERE AND HOW TO GET OURSELVES OUT. AND I THINK WHERE YOU SEE THESE THESE POCKETS EXIST LIKE THE SAN QUENTIN'S. THERE ARE MANY OF IT'S WHERE THERE'S A SHARED AGREEMENT THIS IS THE WORK WE'RE HERE TO DO. AND WERE SUPPORTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT BY THE STAFF AND PEOPLE WERE INCARCERATED THERE READ YES THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE'RE GONNA DO THIS WRK -- SO ONCE YOU HAVE THE SAFETY PIECE WE'RE NOT HERE JUST -- TO TO YOU KNOW COMPETE -- WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER THEN YOU COULD DO THAT WORK. I'M. SO THAT THE WITHIN THOSE SPACES THEY'RE ABLE TO EXPLORE THEIR CRIME THE ONLY WILL ABLE TO CRY. THEY'RE ABLE TO BE TO TRUST THAT THE INFORMATION IS HERE WILL NOT MAKE IT OUT TO THE YARD WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE THEIR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS -- IN ONE OF THE OTHER KEY PONENS CAM COMPONENTS ARE JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY IS. THAT THEY ARE OFTEN GUIDED BY DRIVEN BY -- PEER MENTOR TYPE RELATIONSHIPS PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM -- FIGURE THEMSELVES OUT. DEVELOP CERTAIN SOARING KEY COPING SKILLS THAT THEY'VE AND SHARE WITH OTHERS AND MEN TOWARDS THEIR OWN. JOURNEY -- THOSE THOSE FOLKS IN OFTEN THERE YOU KNOW. LIFE IS DO THAT FOR OTHER LIFE IS THE DOOR FOR FOR NON LIFE IS ALSO. THAT IT'S SUCH A KEY COMPONENT THAT IF YOU HAVE A CORE GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO HAVE THOSE BASIC SKILLS IN US THEY'RE PRETTY COMBINED WHERE THEY CAN SHARE THOSE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STATE? IT MAKES A HUGE IMPACT GIVE PEOPLE THE THE THE HOPE THAT THAT THEY CAN GET THEMSELVES UP PRISON AND A PATHWAY TO ACTUALLY DO THAT. THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE. I'M I'M REALLY EAGER TO HEAR WHAT A NON AS A SAY HAVE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE EXPERIENCES BUT BUT I'LL BE HAPPY IT ALSO ANSWERED QUESTIONS. GO THROUGH. TIME FOR ME SEE WHETHER THERE IS ANY QUESTION EITHER CENTER MORE LOCKER SENATOR PAUL WANTS TO DIRECT PARTICULAR TO MISTER -- LIGHTLY BEFORE WE HEAR FROM A NINE OKAY BUT CENTER MORE LIKE. IT'S UP TO YOU. MISTER WILEY YOU TO ME THAT IF THE TIMES SO MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME. BUT WHAT IS. HAPPENING IN YOUR CHILDHOOD YEAH. COULD YOU GIVE ME. IT'S OBVIOUS ON ITEMS THE JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF BUT AT BRINGS UP CHORE -- WHEN IT COMES TO MIND IS -- THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WORK ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS AS I HAVE A LOT OF STORIES. I'LL TRY TO THE TO NOT GO DO ONE ALONG WAS BUT WELL I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU A SORT OF A GENERAL EXAMPLE. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE I'VE WORKED WITH [inaudible] WHO -- COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES WEATHER WAS GANG RELATED OF ANGER RELATED OTHER ISSUES -- A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE -- HAD AT THE HEAD SORT OF THE CITY THIS IS THE FOLLOWING SCENARIO PLAY OUT. THE HAD A RUN IN AT SCHOOL OR SOMEONE TO BIKE OR TOOK THEIR PROPERTY. THEY CAME HOME CRYING ABOUT IT. AND THEIR PARENTS SAID IF YOU DON'T GO BACK. DOWN THERE GET THAT BY. AND COME BACK HERE THEY DON'T COME BACK. OR WHEN YOU COME BACK I'M GONNA GIVE YOUR WORDS BE THAN THEY DID. SO THEY THEY WERE TOLD IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS YOU HAVE TO USE VIOLENCE. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND YOU BETTER LEARN THAT NOW. OR I'LL TEACH YOU THE HARD WAY. IT'S A VERY COMMON LESSEN THAT PEOPLE GET SO THE WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE WHO'S AGE SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN AND THEIR FIRST RESPONSE TO BEING CHALLENGED IN SOME WAY IS TO USE VIOLENCE IT'S NOT A MYSTERY HOW THAT HAPPENED. BUT THEY OFTEN HAVE NEVER ASK THEMSELVES. AND I'VE NEVER HAD A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY TO FIGURE THAT OUT HOW THEY HOW THEY DEVELOP THAT AS THE RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGER OR OR STRESS THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S ONE THAT SHOWS UP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT. SCENARIOS IN THE CASE THAT WE DEAL WITH. THANK YOU YOU ALSO MENTIONED YOU HAD A 1%. FAILURE RATE IS AT YES THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR PEOPLE WE WORK WITH -- WHO'VE GOTTEN OUT. IS BELOW 1%. 99% NEVER COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME RIGHT. HOW MANY CLIENTS HAVE YOU HAD OVER THE THIRTEEN YEARS YOU'VE BEEN ALL CLIENTS OF OF HAD IT WELL BECAUSE I REPRESENT THEM IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CAPACITIES? OF THOSE THOSE ARE OUT OF THE NOW 200- AND TWELVE LICENSE CLIENTS I'VE HAD RELEASED FROM PRISON -- ARE A WIN WE WE GO TO ROADS AND REPRESENT THE MEN PAROLE HEARINGS WE ALSO DO WORKSHOPS FOR LARGER GROUPS OF PEOPLE WE DO. OTHER THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF CONSULTATIONS TO GIVE THEM ADVICE AND HERE'S HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES NEXT TIME YOU GO. EVEN IF WE'RE NOT REPRESENT BECAUSE SUCH A SMALL GROUP WE CAN REACH EVERYBODY. AND BUT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE WHAT WE DO EAGER TO FIND WAYS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE TRAIN PEOPLE INSIDE INSTITUTIONS TO DO THE WORK WE'RE DOING WHICH WE THINK IS THE MODEL THAT COULD. CAN EXPAND THE REACH OF WHAT WE DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALL RIGHT WE WILL M. HERE FROM ADEN AND CON NOW. AND PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU YES -- MY NAME IS A NON KHAN -- I'M REPRESENTING RESTORE JUSTICE WHICH I'M A CO FOUNDER AND CURRENTLY A CO DIRECTOR OF AND FIRST I WANT TO THANK MADAM CHAIR FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE RARE OPPORTUNITY -- AND I APPRECIATE IN AUSTIN ONE THINK THE STAFF TO HELP ALONG SIDE -- WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME -- ALSO WON SAID I ALSO FEEL THE SAME WAY NEXT TO YOU -- AND YOU'RE TO IS NOT TO THE OF AND SO I THINK THAT. THE RASON -- WALKING OVER BACKGROUND MYSELF I'M A COMMITTED A CRIME AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN IN WHAT SENSE IS THIS ONE FIVE YEARS TO LIFE -- THREE MONTHS AGO ON CHRISTMAS EVE GOVERNOR BROWN COMMUTING MY SENTENCE. I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE RECEIVED THAT -- AND FORTUNATELY SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN PASSED IN AUGUST AND IN JANUARY WHEN INTO EFFECT. WHICH RELEASED ME ON JANUARY. SO I'VE BEEN -- I SERVE SIXTEEN YEARS AND I'VE BEEN OUT TWO MONTHS NOW. I'M THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE I READ THE AUDIT. A POWER THROUGH IT. AND I SAW SOME. ALSO A LOT OF THINGS IN THERE THAT WERE LEFT OUT IN MY OPINION BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF ATTENDING A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS I'M ATTENDED MULTIPLE SELF OGUZ REBUILT TO THE PROGRAMS. AND THERE WAS ALSO A COUPLE OF DISTINCTIONS. IN MY OPINION THAT WERE COMPLETELY LEFT OUT -- THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION GROUPS VERSES THE THE CDC ARE RAN PROGRAMS -- IS A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT TALKS ABOUT. IN TERMS OF CULTURE AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TRUST -- AND ALSO ANYTIME I BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM -- CAN'T MAKE RECIDIVISM RATES UNLESS YOU TALK ABOUT -- AGAIN IN MY OPINION HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THOSE THE TWO HIGHEST. REASONS WHY PEOPLE COME BACK FROM LAST ONE OF THE STUDIES ARE READY SAID.82% OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE COME BACK WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. DIRECTLY LINKED TO HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. AND SO WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS LINKED TO THOSE POOR CBT PROGRAMS COGNITIVE OR THERAPY PROGRAMS. EVER BEEN A SET IN THE AUDIT. I FEEL LIKE THAT WAS FAILED. IN. I HAVE I CAN SPEAK A LOT MORE ON THAT BUT I THINK -- ARE OPEN TO QUESTIONS THE MEASURE ACTUALLY WORKS I'M. SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY. PARTICIPATED IN. A VARIETY OF WHAT CDC ARE CONSIDERED TO BE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS CAN YOU JUST SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THAT -- AGAIN KNOWING THAT THIS IS. YOU'RE SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVES. BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. I THINK -- WHEN I WANT TO START WITH -- WE TALK ABOUT. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY I THINK WHAT IT DOES WHAT COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND I'M NOT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT. A RIGHT OR WRONG WAY BUT I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IS AND PRESSES -- THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM MEANING -- OKAY WHY AM I THINKING LIKE AS I HEARD THAT I'M CRIMINAL THINKING CRIMINAL THINKING A LOT AND IT KIND OF MADE ME. THINK LIKE WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN AM I SUPPOSED TO STOP. THINKING CRIM CRIMINALLY NOW -- AND AND OVERCOME THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE ISSUE THAT'S WITHIN ME. AND A REALLY IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING TRAUMA AND PAIN AND HOW. EXAMPLE I ALWAYS LIKE TO USE IS I WENT FROM MY EIGHT YEAR OLD LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL. EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WITH A LIFE SENTENCE. AND SO HOW CAN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY IN THAT MOMENT HELP ME I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE. FOR ME IT WOULD WHAT HELPED ME WAS REALLY GOING BACK UNDERSTANDING THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ME WHEN MY PARENTS DIVORCE AND THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT WAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME. YES I COMMITTED MY CRIME AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND I MADE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE THAT DAY THAT NIGHT. HOWEVER MY ABANDONMENT FROM EIGHT YEARS OLD MY EXPERIENCES OF NEGLECT AND ABANDONMENT AT TWELVE YEARS OLD. MY HOMELESSNESS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHICH REINFORCED NOT THIS PHYSICAL STRUCTURE ON HAVE A PLACE TO STAY BUT THE REINFORCEMENT OF YOU DON'T MATTER YOU DON'T CARE. THE NEED. FOR A FATHER FIGURE WHO WAS ABSENT IN MY LIFE THE AGAIN AMANDA MANY LIKE THOSE THINGS AREN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESSED AND ADDRESS AT THE ROOT OF WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN. AND SO WHEN I STARTED TAKING THESE -- PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALSO COMMUNITY BASED BRAND WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT MY OPINION. BECAUSE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THERE'S A HUGE BUST. THE FOR ME AND FOR MANY MEN AND WOMEN IN SADDAM'S ONLY FOR WOMEN OR MEN MANY OTHER FRIENDS THAT ARE SPOKEN TO INSIDE. LOT OF TIMES WE DID NOT FEEL LIKE WE WERE EVER PART OF SOCIETY OR COMMUNITY TO BEGIN WITH -- I STRUGGLE AT HOME WITH WITH ISSUES I WENT TO SCHOOL ANDYES MY BEHAVIOR SHOWED UP IN SCHOOL BUT I WAS CONSIDERED A QUOTE UNQUOTE BAD IT. AND SALAS TAKEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM PUT IN DETENTION OR SUSPENSION WE'RE LITERALLY MY FUTURE DEPENDENT ON ME BEING IN THE CLASSROOM. AND SO WHAT I WAS OBSERVED AS IS AN ACADEMIC FAILURE. AND MY EMOTIONAL -- ARMS WERE NEVER DEALT WITH THAT EIGHT NINE ON I STILL NEVER FELT LIKE OKAY I DON'T BELONG AT HOME I DON'T BELONG IN SCHOOL. I WAS KICKED OUT OF HOME NOW TO BELONG IN SOCIETY AND SO THEREFORE AT LEAST LIKE A LOGICALLY -- SOCIETY RULES NO LONGER APPLY TO ME. AND THERE ARE GOING TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES. AND COMING INTO PRISON THERE IS A HUGE CULTURE OF IS ABUSIVE CULTURE OF POWER AND CONTROL IS ACTUALLY. HOT FOR THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS IT'S TIED TO PAID STAFF THAT OVERSEE THE PRISON PROGRAMS. LIKE IF YOU GUYS SIT IN THE TRAINING HONOR SENATE TRAINING BUT JUST. KNOWING HEARING ABOUT IT SITTING IN THE TRAINING IT'S THE MANIPULATORS THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO DO THIS YOU DON'T GIVEN THIS DON'T GIVEN THAT TREAT HIM LIKE THAT THAT THERE. THEY'RE TAUGHT WITH ABUSE AND CONTROL IS IS THE IS THE WAY TO FUNCTION AND DEAL WITH HUMAN BEINGS -- EN EN. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I WANT TO SAY DO NOT DO THAT. IT IN THE AUDIT IT WAS CLEAR TO ME RIGHT WHEN I READ IT IS SAID THAT SANK NGUYEN HAD THE LOWEST. CAMINO A CVT ENROLLMENT RATE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY ENROLLMENT RIGHT. THAT'S BECAUSE IN IN SEGUIN THE LAST FOUR YEARS I SPENT THERE. THIS IS SO HUGE ON COMMUNITY. MAYBE IS THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IS STRUCTURED AND IN THE MIDDLE MARIN QUOTE UNQUOTE LIBERAL BAY AREA I DON'T KNOW BUT IT HAS ACCESS TO PEOPLE -- AND SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING IN THERE THEY WERE BRINGING THEIR PROGRAMS WITH THEM. SO LOT A LOT OF THE MEN INSIDE WERE LIKE I'M NOT GOING TO SEE THE PROGRAM WHERE. IT'S A PAID CDC OUR STAFF. AND THERE'S NO TRUST THERE I'M GOING TO WEAR WE'RE JUST COMMUNITY WHERE I FEEL LIKE I'M LAW -- IN THEIR MIND IN THEIR HEART AND SOUL IF I'M SUPPOSED TO EXPECTED. TO SIT IN A PROGRAM. WELL SUPPOSED TO SHARE MY INNERMOST JAMES TRAUMAS HAYNES. A HERTZ WHATEVER THAT MAY BE. BUT I DON'T TRUST THE PERSON I'M SAYING THAT TO THE WORK IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE. INTERNALLY IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE. BUT IF I'M SITTING IN A IN A CULTURE IN A IN A IN A CLASSROOM. ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE PERSON I'M AND THE PEOPLE I'M SPEAKING. TO I TRUST THEM THEY HERE FOR MY INTEREST THE NOT SEAT CDC ARE OR OR ENOUGH FROM PORTABLE THE MAN. THAT I I BELIEVE I CAN REALLY SPEAK ABOUT MY MY TRAUMAS AND FIND HEALING. ALSO A LOT OF THE CBC PROGRAMS DID NOT ADDRESS VICTIM IMPACT. TO A DEGREE THAT I FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT OUR ORGANIZATION RESTORED IT JUST RESTORE JUSTICE. UNDER OU STAFF WE HAVE SURVIVORS OF CRIME PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES TO VIOLENCE. WORKING ALONGSIDE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED HARM. UNDERSTANDING WHAT HEALING MEANS WERE BOTH SIDES INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY AND THAT THAT WAS LACKING IN MY OPINION IN THE CBC PROGRAMS. ON SO SO THAT IS ANOTHER THING I THINK CULTURE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT -- IS IS I CAN GO INSIDE A CLASSROOM SURE I CAN BE IN A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. GROUP WAS SOON AS I STEP OUT I'M BEING TOLD TO GET OVER HERE GO THERE SHUT UP SIT DOWN. ABUSIVE LANGUAGE CONTROLLING LANGUAGE AND IT'S KIND OF COUNTERPRODUCTIVE -- AN EXAMPLE LIKE TO USE I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND ANYONE ELSE IN THE MILITARY BUT SOMEBODY IS SUFFERING FROM PTSD WOULD YOU PUT HIM IN A PUNITIVE CULTURE. TO HELP HELP THEM OVERCOME PTSD. MANY MEN AND WOMEN IN PRISON SUFFER FROM PTSD. WAR ZONES MAYBE WITHIN THE HOME COMMUNITY -- ENVIRONMENTS. SUFFER FROM PTSD AND I NEED TO BE SEEN AS SUCH [inaudible] AND I SEE LOOK AT THE CLOSER NOW WILL OF WIND DOWN BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOLUNTEERISM AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS VOLUNTEERISM IS ONE THING WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND GIVE THEIR TIME. AND GO BACK INTO THE NINE TO FIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THEY'RE NOT A FIVE THAT IS THEIR JOB. THEY EMOTIONALLY. INVESTED THEY ARE THEY ARE THEIR CAREER IS INVESTED IN THIS TYPE OF WORK [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FOR MY CALL. OKAY -- CENTER VOEPEL HEAD. I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF PRISONS OKAY. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT THERE ARE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. LOOK AT THE WAY THEY OPERATE THE MANAGEMENT -- THE PHILOSOPHY -- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT OF SAN QUENTIN IS DIFFERENT LIKE YOU POINTED OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. SOLUTION. OF YOU PROBABLY BEEN A FEW. DIFFERENT ONES -- WE HAVE WE HAVE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND WE TRY. TO DO THESE STATEWIDE PROGRAMS. THEN WHEN THEY GET NEEDS AND OF THE THIRTY WHATEVER THIRTY FIRE THIRTY FIVE PRISONS. OF THEIR DONE DIFFERENTLY. DEPENDING ON WHO'S IN CHARGE. RIGHT SO DO YOU HAVE A IN GERMANY -- COMMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD CHANGE THAT OF LIKE WHAT KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO THE OPERATE IN A DIFFERENT MODEL -- HOW HOW HOW CAN BE DONE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY? BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THE AUDIT I READ THE OTHER. TWO OF COURSE I WASN'T VERY HAPPY TO READ THAT WE HAD. YOU KNOW LIMITED IMPACT. BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE ONLY WAY A MEASURE THOSE PROGRAMS. WHAT TIME SIX KIND OF? YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I MEASURE PROGRAM I WANT TO SEE IT. BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. FACTORS OF MORE SOPHISTICATED WAY OF MEASURING A PROGRAM. AND AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE RIGHTWAY TO DO IT YOU KNOW SO YOU CAN SEE. YOU KNOW. IF IT MAY NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON RECIDIVISM. BUT HOW DID IT HAVE AN IMPACT INSIDE THE FACILITY I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT. WAYS TO MEASURE. A PROGRAM SO YOU COMMENT ABOUT THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW THE NATURE OF OUR THIRTY FOUR CALIFORNIA PENAL INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE AN YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD CHANGE THOSE. THE THE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS I HAVE I HAVE SOME UPS VOTE FOR YOU. NUMBER REALLY IT WOULD HAVE TO SAY TO OF IN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR OWN OBAMA FELLOWSHIP OF THANK YOU YEAH YOU'RE A MOM OF FELLOW HERE. MANY OF OUR OTHER IS LIKE TWENTY OR TWENTY OF US TWENTY IN THE COUNTRY AND HIS ONE OF HIS OWN COUNTRY. ONE OF OUR BOMBING FELLOWS -- WELL IT AND TO ME JUST BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT THAT UP THE THING THAT I'M. I GUESS PROCESS OF ABOUT THAT IS THAT. IT VALIDATES THAT THE THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH MATTER. RIGHT RIGHT WE WE WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE CONVICTED OF SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES -- AND WEIRS HELPING PEOPLE SEAT LOOKED THE NARRATIVE WE HAVE ABOUT THIS GROUP IS ALL TWISTED. YOU THESE OF BOOKS WE HAVE WHO TRIPPED TRUMP HAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEMSELVES AND THEN THE TRANSFORMER COMMUNITIES -- AND THEY SAY WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO LIFT UP AND ANDAND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON A LARGER SCALE -- SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT FELLOWSHIP IS ABOUT. UP BUT AS TO THE INSTITUTE NEXT. YEAH WHICH ONE DONOVAN OKAY BEEN THERE MANY TIMES. WHAT I FIND IS THAT -- IF V. PRISON ADMINISTRATION. ARTS PROGRAMS MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS AND IS OPEN TO PEOPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE COMING TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY DO BEST -- THEN THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE HEADS OF THIS IT. IT HAS TO GO THROUGH EVERY LEVEL WITHIN THE INSTITUTION I WAS AT A PLACE. OF OUR LEVEL FOR PRISON OF RECENTLY. AND THIS THIS HAPPENED BE ONE THAT HAS HAD A REALLY TERRIBLE RECORD OF OF VIOLENCE USE OF FORCE -- ALL KIND OF NEGATIVE THINGS IN IN THE INSTITUTION [inaudible] N.. I WAS IN THERE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE -- SORT OF FOCUS ON THE PATHWAY HOME. N.. WE'RE COMING TO THE PRISON A STAFF MEMBER. SAID YEAH I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE REWARDING THESE PEOPLE WITH PROGRAM. I GETS ITS ARE THERE ARE MANY TIME RIGHT IT'S IT'S IT'S A MENTALITY THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR THAT. LIKE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT BENEFITS ANYBODY WOULD JUST HELP WITH THESE PEOPLE OUT IT'S NOT BETTER FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL TO WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING PART OF CORRECTIONS. UP WHERE YOU HAVE STAFF AND WARDEN RESTED MINISTRATION I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT MAKE IT A PLACE WHERE THIS IS THE WORK TO BE DONE NEVER HEARD A WORD AND SAY THAT. NO NEVER -- WORDS SEEM TO BE MORE COMMITTED TO THE SERVICES WELL WARDENS ARE THAT'S DEFINITELY ONE SAID THAT THAT THEY OWN I MEAN THANK NGUYEN WAS ALWAYS THE SINK WHEN WE KNOW ABOUT. SURE -- AND IT TOOK WARDEN BEING COMMITTED I EN AND SUCCESS OF WORDS BEING WILLING TO CONTINUE THAT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT OPENNESS TO THE COMMUNITY. A CULTURE WITHIN THE PRISON PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSFERRED IN FROM OTHER PRISONS. DONE TIME IN OTHER PRISONS THEY GET THE SAME POINT IN THINKING OKAY LET ME. RUN IT DOWN FOR ME WHO IS RUNNING WELL WHAT WE DO HOW TO WHAT WHERE DO I GET A KNIFE OUT OF IT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY THIS A NO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE. AND IT BLOWS THE MIND. IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THIS DIFFERENT CULTURE THAT IT THIS. AND I DON'T SAVED SYNC WITH THAT THAT ANY PRISON THIS REALLY GREAT. BUT SAN QUENTIN HAS CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT ON ALL SIDES THIS IS THE WORK WE'RE HERE TO DO. AND THAT TAKES A COMMITMENT FROM THE WAR LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN N.. BOTH SUPPORTING AND AND REWARDING STAFF TO SUPPORT THAT. AND DISCIPLINE THOSE WHO DON'T. PEOPLE GET IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS PEOPLE WHO WORK WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS PROGRAMS PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING UP WITH REASONS TO LOCK PEOPLE DOWN AND IN INTERFERE WITH THE PROGRAM -- IT TAKES ADMINISTRATION BEING COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE LOOK LET'S REMOVE BARRIERS. TO THE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION IS ACTUALLY SUPPORT -- WHERE I SEE THAT HAPPENING? PROGRAMS FLOORS. THE N. EMITTED HELPS THE WITH THEIR CLOSE ENOUGH TO A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA THIS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT OR THEY HAVE TO GET. EXTRA CREATIVE -- TO FACILITATE THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I SEE. THANK YOU -- YES I AGREE WITH MR WILEY -- OF IF I WERE TO ADD TO THAT I WOULD SAY THAT. INITIALLY NOTHING IT DOES NOT WITH THE CULTURE OF THE PRISON -- IS IT A IS IT A PLACE FOR LEARNING IS A PLACE FOR GROWTH IS IT A PLACE FOR ME TO SHARE LIKE A THEN PAINS AND THAT THAT GOES WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING IN CHARGE. OF ME ABOUT I'M GONNA SAY TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS. BUT I'M NOT TO SINK WHEN I STARTED MY SOME SECURITY PRISON WORK MY WAY DOWN TO LEVEL TO SAN QUENTIN WHY ACTUALLY SHIP AND OFFICERS HAND -- AND I'LL ALSO SAY THEY THINK WE CAN STILL IMPROVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CULTURE OF OFFICERS -- IN MY OPINION. BUT IT TOOK ME THAT LONG TO CHECK AN OPPOSITE HAND AND AND THEN. IMMEDIATELY HIT MY MY MY MY LIKE WHOA OKAY -- NOT SO BAD. I FEEL SAFER I FEEL SAFE. I'M A LOT OF THE FEARS COME FROM USE OF AUTHORITY. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BEGINNINGS -- AND THEN NOTHING LIKE YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE ATTRACTED BECAUSE THEY'LL BE MORE INCLUDES INCLUDED. INTO THESE PRISONS -- Là TIME THERE'S THIS DIVISION OF IN MEAT LOVERS ALL THE TERM GOING AROUND. YOU KNOW -- KNOWN. AND IN LANGUAGE AS THE OWNER ON THE I'M NOT I WON'T USE HERE BUT YOU'RE IN MAY LOWER YOUR SUCH AND SUCH AND SO IT IT'S IT'S MORE THESE DEMORALIZING -- AND THEN THE THE THE TROUBLE IT TAKES FROM VOLUNTEERS OR COMMUNE BASED ORGANIZATION TO GET IN A PRISON. IS CONSTANTLY OUR TURN AROUND YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS EVEN THOUGH THAT PERSON PUT IT A WARRANT THE SAME THING THE WEEK BEFORE I'M IT IS IS IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR GAMES -- AN IS REALLY DEMORALIZING THEY CAN BE AND SO THAT CULTURE I BELIEVE NEEDS TO CHANGE -- WORK MANY VETS ORGANIZATIONS CAN COME IN INTO THE PRISON AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE PEOPLE INSIDE -- I THINK. IT IS ALSO CLEAR IN THE IN THE AUDIT WHERE TO TALK ABOUT SAID AS THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. ANY FACILITY CORCORAN THEY TALK ABOUT THE RECIDIVISM RATES FOR THE INCARCERATED MEN AND BY THAT PROGRAM THAT THEY EVALUATED WAS LOWER AND I'M GONNA ASK A QUESTION NEXT ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND SO SO IN THAT FACILITY. THERE'S AN OFFICER THAT WAS QUOTED BY SAYING THAT I AN OPPOSITE SAID THE I BELIEVE THE REASON WHY THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS OFFICER SAYING THAT IN THE AUDIT AND SO. I THINK THAT -- NOTHING I WAS ONE ADD BRIEFLY IS WITH ME BASS ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU TALK ABOUT MAKING. A CHANGE THE CULTURE -- AND LINKING IT TO RE ENTRY. THE REASON I AM I FEEL LIKE I'M SUCCESSFUL AND I'M SET UP TO BE SUCCESSFUL ON MURRAY ENTRY IS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HELPED ME. THROUGH AND THROUGH THE DAY AFTER THE THEIR DAY OF ON ME THAT I GOT OUT. THAT LINKAGE OF RE ENTRY IS NOT THERE WHEN IT COMES TO NOT IN MY OPINION NOT COMING BACK. AND SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE OR JUST. PUT OUT THERE THE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING. IS THAT MANY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO BE AT THE CENTER OF WHATEVER THIS CULTURE SHIFT IS GOING. TO AND HAVE A STATE IN A HUGE STAKE IN. HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THIS PROGRAM IS AN HOUR GOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF? C. C. R.. AND RECIDIVISM LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES. I HAD A WE WE DISCUSSED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- ESTABLISHING A A MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND INCREASING OUR PROGRAMS -- MEDICAL ASSISTED TREATMENT -- FOR INMATES AND WETALKED ABOUT -- HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE? SUBSTANCE ABUSERS INSIDE THE PRISON. AND HOW HAT OVERWHELMS. SERVE THE CULTURE IN THE PRISON -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT -- AND YOU TALK ABOUT. HOW WE CAN A COUNTER THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE CULTURE? INSIDE THE PRISONS. HOW WELL YOU YOU THINK THIS MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING? UPPER IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE MEDICAL STUFF THAT WE NEED TO PUT INTO THOSE WHAT I'D LOSE WHAT'S YOUR OPINION I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE -- EXPLORING. ALL THE DIFFERENT. NOW THESE AND AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT -- UP TO NOW IT HAS BEEN -- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS YEAH WELL STEP YEAH. WHICH DOESN'T WORK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE -- BUT IT IS SORT OF THE FAVORED. APPROACH ON AND WHAT I FOUND AGAIN. LOOKING AT AT IT THROUGH THE PAROLE BOARD LENS. IT IS BECAUSE IT'S A FAMILIAR ENOUGH MODEL TO ROLL COMMISSION. IF THEY CAN THEY CAN TRACK -- TRACK IT AS A STRUCTURED APPROACH TO RECOVERY AND SOBRIETY -- TWELVE STEPS OKAY WOULD YOU WORK TWELVE STEPS AND YOU CAN SHOW THAT YOU HAVE A CLEAN UP RECORD BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN PRISON. THEN YOU'VE YOU'VE ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE. BUT IT DOES THAT DOESN'T WORK THE WAY FOR EVERYBODY. AND SO THERE'S SOME OTHER STRUCTURED WAY SOMEONE'S GOTTEN CLEARLY MAINTAIN SOBRIETY. RATE MOST -- AND THEN. THEY SAY THE THREE THINGS WOULD BE THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. OUR NUMBER HERE ABLE SERBIAN TWELVE STEP SO. THE YEAH I KNOW IT IN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AUDIT IS IS. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. YOU KNOW MAYBE. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I I'M NOT SURE I'M NOT SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT THE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD. I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY THOSE THINGS ARE [inaudible] I KNOW [inaudible] PERSONALLY THAT -- MY SISTER BECAME A DRUG ADDICT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT. TRAUMA SHE EXPERIENCED AS A KID WAS OR FALL. NOW IF NONE OF THESE GROUPS ADDRESS THAT. THEN THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT. AND SO THAT THAT CORD TRAUMA. IF IT REMAINS UNADDRESSED THEN SORT OF FIXING IT IN THE IMMEDIATE. TIME DOESN'T REALLY GET THERE IT DOESN'T HAVE A LASTING. IN FACT I THINK BUT GEN. IF YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE ALL AGREE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT. THEN AS SOON AS I OFFER AT NINE SOMETHING THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE. THEN I'M GOING TO BE OSTRACIZED THIS COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY'VE ALL AGREE IS NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING -- BUT YOU GOTTA HAVE YOU GOTTA HAVE AND AND YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE OF THAT ASPECT OF THE THE THE AUTO AUDITOR'S REPORT. TALK ABOUT SAID AT THE THE KEY THAT IT WAS IT WAS A WE HAVE A A CULTURE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION BUT THEY CREATED THAT THEY'RE SAYING. WE'RE GOING TO GROUP TOGETHER PEOPLE DOING THIS WORK AND THEY SUPPORT EACH OTHER THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT. A THAT'S WHAT CREATES THE COMMUNITY AND SO THEY AGREE THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT YOU CAN'T JUST SORT OF DO ONE THING. YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER AND IT WORKS THE CREATE EVEN EVEN THE INSTITUTION WHERE THE OTHER YARD. WE HAVE ONE WHERE THIS IS WHAT OR IN ONE BUILDING THIS IS WHAT WE DO HERE. IT'S A START BUT YOU GOTTA OF THE MORE THOSE POCKETS WE CREATE THE BETTER SUCCESS WE SEE. FIVE ADD TO THAT THINK THAT -- YEAH ABSOLUTELY NO SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS A HUGE ISSUE IN OUR SOCIETY AND AND AND THEN INSIDE OF OUR PRISONS. IT DOESN'T CHANGE -- AND I AGREE FOR THAT TOTAL RECOVERY ACT AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT A RELAPSE IS PART OF RECOVERY -- HAPPENS IT CAN BE A PART OF RECOVERY AND UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR PRESENT CULTURE NOW IF YOU RELAPSE IN PRISON YOU WILL BE DEALT WITH -- AND SO NOBODY ADMITS EVEN THOUGH THE A OR AN A YOU CAN GO THERE HI MY NAME'S ANONYMOUS ALCOHOLIC OR ON THE YOU KNOW. THE DRUG ADDICT. I CAN'T ADMIT HEY MAN I I I I SLID LAST NINE I HAD. YOU KNOW I USED. BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO BE PUT INTO SEGREGATION. AND THEN GET ADMINISTRATIVE -- RIGHT UP THE WORKING JEOPARDIZE MY FUTURE AND AND WHATEVER. AND SO. EVEN IF THE PERSON RELAPSE AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND RELAPSE TO BE PART OF RECOVERY HAPPENS THAT'S OF HATE IS NOT OKAY WITH OKAY -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT STUFF IS IS HITTING A HAS TO BE IT BECAUSE OF THE FEAR. OF OF PUNISHMENT. SO WE LOOK AT THAT POLICY. YEAH THANK YOU. THAT ARE MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MEDICARE THANKS FOR THIS PANEL TOGETHER THIS IT'S BEEN. REAL HELPFUL BY BACKGROUND I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. ORANGE COUNTY SO WE HAD. ONE WELL ONE OF THE TOP. TEN JAIL SYSTEMS AND IN THE IT'S PRETTY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SIZE BROKE. WHEN I WALKED INTO THE JOB -- THERE WERE THIRTY LAWSUIT IT'S MY INMATE. IT WOULD JUST HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITY THAT ALL SAID YOU KNOW IN A CLOSED SESSION YOU START TO REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COUNTY THAT YOU. REALLY WEREN'T PRIVY TO BEFORE. THERE WAS ALSO A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS -- IT INTO ONE OF OUR JAIL STEEL LACEY WHO -- THE THE THE THAT BE SURE OF SOME FORM OF THE OTHER INMATES SAID HE HAD. BEEN. PUT IN THERE BECAUSE HE HAD MOLESTED A CHILD WHICH WAS NOT TRUE. AND THE DEPUTIES LOOK THE OTHER WAY WATCH TV WHATEVER AND IS HIS FELLOW INMATES IN THAT PARTICULAR WORD [inaudible] PROCEEDED [inaudible] TO VDM. I POURED SCALDING WATER ON THE JUMPED FROM BUNKS ON HIM. AND WHEN THE AUTOPSY REPORT CAME OUT I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THAT MANY RIPS THAT WERE THAT WE MUST BE BROKEN. SO I IT'S IT'S IT'S NICE TO KINDA. WITH ALL THAT BACKGROUND. BECAUSE OF OUR OTHER CONTEXT I'M IS DURABLE AND ANYTHING YOU BRING BACK ALL THIS. THIS HISTORY THAT YOU. YOU YOU HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN IT HAD A READ ALL THESE LAWSUIT. GRAND JURY REPORTS AND AND AND AND THAT -- I APPRECIATE. TRYING TO CHANGE A CULTURE. BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT WE HAD TO DO. IN ORANGE COUNTY. NOT EASY. TO DO -- SO I SO THANK YOU THIS IS. MEMBER VERY HELPFUL SO I I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. UNLIKE SENATOR BELL. I'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF STAYING OUT OF STATE PRISONS THEY DON'T. I'M INVITING YOU TO GO WITH YEAH YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ALWAYS. CENTER BELLS INVITED ME TO GO TO DONOVAN YOU'VE BEEN A COUPLE TIMES A FEW TIMES.

VISIT IS THAT AS MANY AS YOU CAN -- AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A MIX OF SECURITY LEVELS -- BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE. AND YOU'LL SEE YOU KNOW -- I'M I REFERRED TO TO THE HIERARCHY OF NEED YOU'LL SEE. THAT PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON SURVIVAL. IN CERTAIN PLACES AND OTHER PLACES THE CONVERSATION IS VERY DIFFERENT [inaudible] VERY DIFFERENT. HI BUT YOU CAN ONLY SEE THAT WHEN YOU GET IN THERE AND ACTUALLY ACTUALLY TALKED. TALKED WITH MANY PEOPLE CAN I WAS THEY DON'T JUST. DON'T JUST DON'T JUST TAKE THE GUIDED TOUR -- GROUPS OF THAT'S GREAT YEAH. THAT'S GOOD WAS LISTENING MORE THAN TALKING IS A GOOD WAY TO GO I THINK. I ALSO ENCOURAGE GOING AS MUCH MAGIC AND DIFFERENT FACILITY JUVENILE FACILITIES I MEAN GIVE. OUR PERSPECTIVE A SEGREGATED HOUSING UNITS. WERE IN ADMINISTRATORS. MISSION -- I CAN THE FIRST THAT IS TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THERE AND I MEAN PEOPLE I MEAN I'VE HEARD -- LIKE YOU KNOW THE TERMS LIKE INMATES AND PRISONERS AND OFFENDERS OF CONSTANTINE USED AND AND I I PREFER THE TERM INCARCERATED PERSON A PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED OR FATHER OR MOTHER WAS INCARCERATED -- HUMANIZES PEOPLE. I A IN A LONG ACROSS THE QUALIFIER OF HEY YOU ARE YOU ARE ON A FENDER IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE CAUSE AND REMINDING PEOPLE. IS WRITTEN TO OUR LEGISLATION I MEAN IT WHEN I WENT TO TRIAL IT WAS. IT WAS THE PEOPLE VICE VERSUS A NON CON. THE ALREADY I'M AGAINST THE pPEOPLE. I'M I'M NOT I WANT TO BE PART OF SOCIETY AND SO YOU HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE INSIDE -- I BE I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE BENEFICIAL SO THAT I CAN THE FIRST THAT IS TO TALK TO PEOPLE INSIDE I THINK THE NEXT THAT IS ENOUGH THE WHENEVER YOU HAVE THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW PEOPLE. I'M I THINK THERE'S A DOES THE NEXT. TALKING TO PEOPLE -- AND THEN. FORMERLY INCARCERATED HUNDRED PEOPLE UT HEE BAY AREA UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA THERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED DOING AMAZING THAT PEOPLE RIGHT BEHIND ME. WHEN AMAZING AMAZING WORK SO IF YOU CAN'T GO THERE COLLISON HERE? HAVE LUNCH IN A IN OR SOMETHING AND AND I LOVE THE FOOD OUT HERE I'VE BEEN OUT TWO MONTHS. IN -- LET'S HAVE LET'S HAVE LUNCH FIRST AND THEN WE'LL GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. BUT BUT SO YES I WANNA Là ORDINANCE FOR ANSWERS PLEASE YES. MY LAST QUESTION AND THEN IS FOR YOU AND THAT IS WHY DID GOVERNOR BROWN ACT. GRACE. I MEAN HE WROTE IT OUT ON PAPER BUT PERSONALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM I UNDERSTAND THAT GETTING A COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE IS IS LIKE WINNING. MAYBE EVEN MORE HAVE MORE RARE THAN THAT BECAUSE HOW. INFREQUENTLY THEIR HANDED OUT. ON AND SO WHY WHY DID YOU WHY DID YOU DO ANY ON PAPER HE WROTE -- WHO HE SAW WHY WAS TODAY IN THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE? I'M IN A BELIEVE HE BELIEVES THAT HE BELIEVE I'M NO LONGER A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY -- THAT'S LIKE THE IF YOU COULD SAY I DID ANYONE IS IN IT BUT LIKE PROBABLY THE CORRECT WRITING. I WITH THAT YOU ASKED EXACTLY WHAT EACH WAS MEAN -- I'M I I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IN AS WELL -- BUT I I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT -- I'M PRIVILEGED IN THIS AND NOW ALSO SADISM THERE ARE MANY MORE MANY WOMEN INSIDE RIGHT NOW. THE DESERVE THAT AS WELL. I READ THIS. I READ IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD MAN NOW. AND WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU A GOOD MAN. I CANNOT SAY THAT I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD MAN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD KID -- THERE'S A PIECE OF ME THAT OUT WHAT IS THE HUGE VOID OF VACANCY IN MY HEART THAT WASN'T FILLED -- I MEAN IF YOU ASK ME WHO I WAS. OUR BEFORE MEETING MY CRIME NOW IS IT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR. WE NEEDED I'M A FATHER FIGURE WHO NEEDED SHELTER BUT WHO LOVE PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY GAVE ASK DOLLARS. HAVE A BURGER TO EAT AND THEN FOUND AND SEVEN CENTS BECAUSE THE DOLLAR SEVEN NINE EISENBERGER THAT DOLLARS. SEVEN YOU KNOW AND FIND SEVEN CENTS TO FULLY GO GET THAT NINE EISENBERGER THAT THAT'S WHAT WAS -- IN THAT MOMENT. I LET MY SELFISHNESS MAMA HOMELESSNESS EXCUSES MUCH TRAUMA ONE GOING GROWING UP ALL ADD UP AND I MADE THE DECISION -- THAT NIGHT TO DO THAT AND SO. I NEARLY THREW ACCOUNTABILITY FEW HOURS LATER WHEN I WAS ARRESTED -- HAD GENUINE GENUINE REMORSE I MEAN. CRIED RIGHT MY EYES OUT THE NEXT MORNING COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN. AN EMPATHY AND THAT NEVER CHANGED I THINK THAT WE TALK OR REHABILITATION -- IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT CHANGING SOMEBODY BUT AS IT'S REMINDING. PEOPLE OF THE GOODNESS AND THEN -- AND SOMETIMES YOU ASKED ME A WHAT WHY DID YOU CHANGE I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CHANGE AYE BEALL ABSOLUTELY UP GROWN. BUT I'VE BEEN REMINDED OF MY TRUE CORE MY WHY AM. FUNNY. PERSON CARING -- AND AND PATHETIC. YOU KNOW SELFLESS BUT THOSE ARE QUALITIES THAT WERE ALREADY ALWAYS IN ME. THERE WERE JUST. FOSTER TO COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE. THANK YOU SENATOR BROWN SENATOR. MORE LIKE FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT. ALLOWED THESE THINGS. TO BE EXPRESSED. IT'S A HARD NOW TO JUST -- QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE LEGIT FOR US GIVEN THAT WE'RE HAVING HEARING TO TRY TO COME OUT BUT I WILL DO MY BEST RIGHT NOW -- BUT THANK YOU BOTH. EVERYTHING YOU'VE EXPRESSED A FOR I'M. BOTH OF YOU HAVE EXPRESSED IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT I WOULD LIKE IF YOU -- COULD. TO GIVE US A LITTLE RECAP ON WHAT YOU FEEL. MAKES A SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM AND YOU CAN BOTH PROVIDE THAT AND I HAVE TWO OTHER QUESTIONS. I MEAN I AM PROUD TO REPEAT WHAT I'VE BEEN MAKING THIS WHOLE TIME IS. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT FALL IS MORE THAN VOLUNTEERS AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW GOING LIKE IT'S A GOING TO YOUR NINE TO FIVE AND THEN MAYBE YOU HAVE. ON THE WEEKENDS ARE LATER ON THE DAY. TWO HOURS IN A CLASS MANY DAYS ORGANIZATIONS ARE FULLY INVESTED IN THE IN THE SERVICE OF PEOPLE AND TRULY HONORING COMMUNITY AND THAT. GOES INTO RE ENTRY LIKE I SAID THE REASON I AM IN THE SUCCESSFUL MISSION. BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF RE ENTRY OF A PLACE TO STAY AND I HAVE A JOB. BECAUSE WE AND IT WAS IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PROGRAMS I WAS TAKEN WHILE I WAS INSIDE -- IN FOR IT THE CBO THE COMMITTEE BASS OR THIS THIS UPCOMING MOVEMENT -- AND ALSO IF I COULD ADD I THINK. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST BUT MAYBE AN INDEPENDENT NEWER EVALUATION OR NEW AUDIT WITH INCLUDING ALL OF THESE FACTORS THAT WE MENTION HERE -- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE PREVIOUS AUDIT WITH -- SO THEY'LL BE NOW THE ONE THING AND THEN -- BIGGER THING IS CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN TRULY TRULY FEEL SAFE. TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME PAIN AND TRAUMA. NOT JUST IN THOSE HOUR AND A HALF OR TWO HOURS AT THEIR IN THAT CLASS BUT BUT WHEN THEY EXIT THEIR CLASSROOM AND GO BACK INTO. PRISON THAT THEY STILL FEELS. THAT THERE'S A COMMUNITY INSIDE A PRISON THAT STILL CARES. I WOULD ADD TO THAT. THE FIRST TO TO TO ECHO THAT LAST POINT IS. THIS IDEA OF THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES THAT THAT. THAT ARE COMMITTED. TO THE SAFETY TO HEALING AND TO CONFIDENTIALITY -- TO TO CREATE THE SPACE WAS WORKING HAPPEN. I WOULD ALSO ADD -- THE THE CRITICAL PIECE AND AND NON TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT THE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME WAY TO CONNECT VIOLENT CRIME OF PREFERABLY IN A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MODEL -- THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON EVERYONE INVOLVED PERPETRATE CRIMES. THE THING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND I WOULD ALSO ADD -- THAT. THE ROLE OF PEER MENTORS -- TO CONTINUE IN GUY THESE CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE TIME THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LAST. ON THE YARD -- YOU MOVING THROUGHOUT THE PRISON -- INFORMALLY AT NIGHT IN THE MORNING THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE ARE HAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION THAT EVERYONE GETS. DEPRESSED DIVE POSSIBLE OUTSIDE OF THE STRUCTURES OF THE CIVIC PROGRAM WHICH MAY BE LETTER OR FACILITY ABOUT CIVIL FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE LAST PIECE I WOULD I WOULD ADD IS. IT'S CONNECTED TO THE PYRAMID. FOR YOU GOT EXPAND THE THE ROLE IN ACCESS OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE -- IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN. M. ON THE OUTSIDE. BECAUSE THEY'VE COME OUT WITH SUCH A HUGE YOU KNOW WEALTH OF INFORMATION SKILLS AND INSIGHTS. AND THERE AND NOW THEY'RE BUT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF WHO USED TO BE THAT. RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S THOSE ARE SOME COMPONENTS I THINK ARE ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL. PROGRAMS INSIDE AND A BRIEF WE ADD -- ONE WHEN WHEN I WHEN I SICKENING AND I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT ONE AS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS ONE IDENTIFY WITH THAT WHO THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE THEY ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. FLOODING THESE COMMITTEES SURVIVORS OF CRIME BUT IN THESE COMMUNITIES POPLE WHO HAVE RESOURCES AND AND DIFFERENT PRIVILEGES LET IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- SO JUST IDENTIFY WHAT THAT COMMITTEE. MY SECOND QUESTION IS. IN. BOTH ADDRESS THIS TO A DEGREE BUT IF YOU WANTED TO REACH OUT. WHAT ARE THE KEY SUPPORTS AND PROGRAMS THAT WORK UP ON REENTRY? WE OBVIOUSLY. PART OF WHY WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE INVEST IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS INSIDE. IS FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY BUT THEN WE'VE ALSO. IT'S ALREADY BEEN RAISED. IT'S NOT ENOUGH ALONE DO THE PROGRAM'S INSIDE. WHAT AND WE ALSO HAVE TO DO? UPON RELEASE AND IF YOU COULD JUST RECAP THAT ARM. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE HAS TO BE CLARITY AND CERTAINTY -- AND AND IN TERMS OF THE PLACEMENTS IN A SAFE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT. ON THE OUTSIDE. THAT IS NOT OVERLY RESTRICTIVE THAT IS NOT AN EXTENSION OF THE PRISON. OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST NON FOR FOCUSING ON TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. AND THEIR NUMBER THOSE PROGRAMS THAT OF THAT -- COME INTO BEING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON FROM. A AN INDETERMINATE LIFE SENTENCE MOST OF THEM ARE GOING TO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX MONTHS OR A TWO YEAR. SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE -- MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY READ A GREAT. THEY THEY IMPOSE SOME BARRIERS ON YOU DISSIPATE IN IN -- COLLEGE COURSES ORDER JOBS EVEN OR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE A JOB WAITING FOR YOU. THAT THEY WILL LET YOU GET -- TO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE PLACES BE SUPPORTIVE AND PROVIDE. ACCESS TO PEOPLE TO REALLY RE INTEGRATE WITH. AND I ALSO THINK. THAT THEY HAVE TO BE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT TO USE THESE THE SOFT SKILLS THEY'VE LEARNED WHAT. PRESIDENT OF THE THURGOOD HARD SKILLS TO THEY NEED ACCESS TO TRADE UNIONS -- IN A PRESS A PROGRAMS FOR SURE BUT ALSO A BECAUSE THEY CAN PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO THEM DOING THAT -- SO I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT I WOULD ALSO SAY. THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME -- SOME TYPE OF MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. BECAUSE PEOPLE PEOPLE STRUGGLE PEOPLE STILL DEALING WITH THEIR CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE PRISON DRAMA. FROM FROM THE PRISON EXPERIENCE ITSELF -- I HAVE I'VE. WORKED WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME OUT THERE LIKE YEAH THIS IS THIS IS ART IS A LOT HARDER IF I WOULD BE. THE CHALLENGES I DIDN'T COULDN'T FULLY ANTICIPATE INSIDE. AND ARNOLD THERE AREN'T ENOUGH -- SUPPORTS FOR THEM ESPECIALLY. IF THEY'RE NOT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH CASE LOAD FORMALLY. THEIR CONTACT WITH -- THE PRO OUTPATIENT CLINIC ON THE OUTSIDE IS LIMITED -- IFNOT A MEDICATION VERY LIMITED BUT THEY NEED THAT THAT THAT TO REALLY SUPPORT THE TRANSITION I THINK AND THAT THAT GOES. TO DEALING WITH MARRIAGE AND FAMILY IS ALSO. AMANDA ECHOING WHEN HE SAID NOTHING UP TO A FRIEND OF BY SAYING THAT. THE THE PROGRAM'S INSIDE ME TO HAVE A DIRECT. AND AND LIKE SUBSTANTIAL LINKAGE. I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE OF RT. THE MY FINAL QUESTION IS. MR WIDELY YOU -- DESCRIBED WHAT AND COMMON LAW IS DOING. YOU ALSO DESCRIBED THAT YOU'RE KIND OF SMALL -- SO I AM SENSING THAT YOU FEEL ARE THE GREATER NEED I CAN YOU DESCRIBE OR ARE YOU ALREADY IN THE MIDST OF OF LOOKING OUT -- STUDYING OR DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL FOR HOW. YOU'RE THE TYPE OF SUPPORT YOU PROVIDE MIGHT BE EXPANDED. WHAT YEAH IN FACT YOU KNOW? THINKING ABOUT ALL THE PIECES WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. THE THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THE YOUR MENTOR MODEL -- PARTNERING WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THIS WITH A DEEP DIVE -- THERAPEUTIC WORK INSIDE. WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE IS? TO CREATE MORE OF THESE POCKETS MORE OF THESE. PLEASE FIND A A POPULATION THAT IS MANAGEABLE MIA A DIVIDE A COUPLE OF PRISONS. BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR -- SO WE'LL LOOK THERE'S THERE'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED OR SO -- PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES AT THIS PARTICULAR PRISON WHAT IF WE HAD ALL OF THEM IN THE PROGRAM. WHAT IF MY THE WHAT THE MODEL WE'VE CREATED? WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF THEM. AND THAT INVOLVES FORMING CARS REALLY PEOPLE INVOLVES TRAINING PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY THERE. TO HELP LEAD AND MENTOR OTHERS -- HAVING COUNSELORS AND THERAPISTS -- FROM THE OUTSIDE COME IN AND DO THIS WORK SO THAT WHEN WE'RE GONNA CONVERSATION EXISTS AND THEY CREATE. MORE THESE THESE THESE POCKETS THESE OF THESE PLACES WHERE THEY CAN REPLACE THE THE THE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE THAT WE STAND WITH I WOULD. CALL IT CYCLES OF VIRTUE. PLACES WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SUPPORTIVE. OF EACH OTHER IN ADDITION -- TO IN ADDITION TO MORE OF THEM BEING SUCCESSFUL AS THEY GO TO THE PAROLE CONSIDERATION PROCESS. WE ALSO THINK WHILE THEIR THEIR WILLS THERE IS SOME OTHER WAYS WE CAN MEASURE WHAT SUCCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE. I THINK WE SEE LESS VIOLENCE IN PRISON WE SEE FEWER USES OF FORCE WE SEE FEWER ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS. WE FEW WE SEE -- LET'S DISCIPLINE OF OF THE STAFF MEMBERS -- AND WE SEE OVERALL GREATER PARTICIPATION IN OTHER TYPES OF POSITIVE PROGRAMS. AND THOSE ALL MEASURABLE MEAN EVERY EVERY ALL MOVEMENT IS TRACKED ELECTRONICALLY IN PRISONS NOW SO WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HOW ALL THAT LOOKS -- BUT WE THINK THAT HAVING OF A CONCENTRATED EFFORT. FOR SHORT PERIOD TIME WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING OF THIS AGO THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM -- WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE? AND BY THE END OF THAT THREE YEARS WITH THE LAST HALF INVOLVES A A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT. IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND DESIGN WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE ON A STATE BY STATE. ALL WE CAN IN OTHER WE CAN INTENTIONALLY CREATE ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL WHAT HAS WHAT TOOK. TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO CREATE IT. FOR EXAMPLE. WE CAN CREATE MORE POCKETS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE I'M HAPPY TO SHARE ALL THE DETAILS BUT BUT YOU IT -- YOUR PARTY DEVELOP THAT PROPOSAL YES THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE. YES YES I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MY ONLY WORRY. THE LAST MOMENT. OUR HEARING WITNESSES ONE MAKE MISTER HONOR MISTER WILEY. I WOULD JUST SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO TALK ABOUT THESE DAYS. EIGHT EIGHT TO HEAR MR CONCERTS -- PERSPECTIVE OF SOAP SO CRITICAL IN THIS CONVERSATION. I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY. FOR OPPORTUNITY I MEAN TWO MONTHS OUT OF PRISON WHO WHO GETS THIS OPPORTUNITY I'M VERY PRIVILEGED UNDERSTAND THAT. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- AND ALSO WANT TO SAY LIKE MAYBE OR ALL UP TO DATE GOOD QUESTION TO ASK MILEY. THERE'S A ORGANIZATION THAT IS ME BASED COLLABORATIVE ORGANIZATION THIRTY FIVE ORGANIZATION CALLED THE TRANSFORMATIVE -- IN PRISON WORKGROUP THE P. W..

SUPPORT PROGRAM MORE RIGHT I DON'T THINK SHOULD TAKE MORE. THE STUFF OUT OF PROGRAM AT THE CITY SO OFTEN THE PROGRAM IS NEEDED THE PROGRAM ALSO. HAVEN'T BUT ON WHAT WHAT WOULD THEY COULD GET SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. HOW MUCH I'M IN IT TRY TO KEEP THIS REALLY BRIEF CONCISE? ONE MORE ITEM. ARMED MY NAME IS AMANDA BURGER ON THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITHIN SAY CURTAIN PROGRAM WHERE OF FORTY EIGHT WEEK CURRICULUM. ALL IS TO RECONNECT PEOPLE TO SPELL. COMMUNITY IN THE NATURAL WORLD. ACTUALLY NATIONALLY I'M ALSO A FOUNDING MEMBER OF W. AND I ON THE BOARD OF FUND COMMON LAW -- ONE IS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT WE WORKING NINE PRISONS AND CALIFORNIA SPENDING HEALTH FACILITIES WOMEN'S FACILITIES WORK WITH PEOPLE OR THINGS LIKE THAT. PEOPLE FACING LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE WITH YOUTH AND I ALSO MANAGER PROGRAM ON EACH UNIT AT SAN QUENTIN. MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE UPPER YARD IT'S AND CLINTON. PLACE CALLED H. UNIT WHICH IS WHERE THE MEN LIVE WHO HAVE TO TERMINATE DATES WHO WERE GOING HOME IN EIGHT YEARS OR LESS ON I WANTED TO SAY THE JUST ANECDOTALLY ESPECIALLY ON EACH UNIT WE DO WE WORK FROM TO SUPPORT REENTRY NEEDS WITH PEOPLE IT OFTEN ALL AND ALSO IT FULL SERVE WOMEN'S FACILITIES. AND I WANNA SAY ANECDOTALLY IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR US TO HAVE PARTICIPANTS. WHO EVEN A MONTH BEFORE THEY GO HOME HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY'RE GOING? WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE LIVING WHAT THEY'RE AND PORT THEM -- AS A RESULT OF THAT WE NOW IT SAYS THE NEED PEOPLE BEFORE THEY LEAVE PRESENT SO WE CAN CONNECT THEM WITH TRUSTED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES EMPLOYERS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS. I WANT TO FOCUS MY REMARKS TODAY ON A OUR FOCUS GROUP THAT WE DID WITH CHIEF WENDY STILL FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THE MAN ON A UNIT THIS SUMMER. ARE IN AUGUST AND WE ASK THEM TO QUESTIONS WE ASKED THE MEN TO QUESTIONS. IF YOU HAD THE POWER TO DESIGN RE RELEASED PROGRAMMING WHAT WOULD YOU DO. WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION GOING HOME? HERE ARE SOME OF THEIR RESPONSES. WE NEED TRAINED COUNSELORS WITH FEWER PEOPLE ON THEIR CASE LOADS RIGHT NOW WE CAN BARELY SEE OUR COUNSELORS ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE NEED A SKYPE SYSTEM TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH PAROLE AGENTS PRIOR TO RELEASE AND WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR AGENTS BEFORE LEAVING. WE NEED JOB TRAINING THAT MATCHES THE MARKET ECONOMY MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR APPRENTICESHIPS AND CONNECTIONS TO UNIONS BEFORE GOING HOME. WE NEED BETTER COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE THE MOST TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH US. AND THUS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN OUR REENTRY IF ALLOWED BY THE CDC ARE IMPRISONED STAFF. ON ONE THING I THINK YOU ALL NEED TO KNOW IS THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME TECHNICAL BARRIERS. THAT PREVENT US FROM HAVING ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OUR PROGRAMS ONCE THEY PAROLE. WE NEED THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER PEOPLE ERA AND TRANSFER PAROLE INDOOR PROBATION TWO DIFFERENT COUNTIES BASED ON WHERE MORE OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT EXIST. NOT ALL COUNTIES ARE CREATED EQUAL AND I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE WITH SOMEONE BEING FORCED TO PAROLE. TO TURLOCK FOR EXAMPLE HAD HE GONE TO STOCKTON WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR HE WOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF SERVICES BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT COUNTY. WE NEED MORE FOCUS ON PROGRAMS GEARED TOWARDS MEN ON EACH UNIT PROGRAMS GEARED TOWARDS MEN THAT HAVE TO TERMINATE DATE CENTER GOING HOME. WELL SAN QUENTIN KNEW SO WELL KNOWN TO ALL OF US FEW VENTURE EACH UNIT. WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS PRE RELEASE THAT ADEQUATELY PREPARE MANNING WOMEN TO DEAL WITH REENTRY REALITIES. FAMILY REUNIFICATION RELAPSE CLIMENT POTENTIAL PAROLE VIOLATIONS WE NEED MORE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO GUIDE US. AND TALK WITH US TO PREPARE US FOR THE CHALLENGES ON THE OUTSIDE AND FINALLY ONE LAST RECOMMENDATION THEY HAD. WE NEED TO BRING THE PACK MEETINGS BACK INSIDE THE PRISONS. SO THAT SERVICES SO THAT PEOPLE INSIDE CAN MEET PEOPLE OFFERING SERVICES AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM BEFORE THEY GO HOME. POTENTIALLY EACH BUILDING SIGNING UP FOR PROGRAMS AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR BUT WHEN PEOPLE. ROLE THEY GO TO ACT MUNICH MEETING IN THE COMMUNITY AND THERE'S KIND OF LIKE A ONE STOP SHOPPING WHERE YOU KIND OF LIKE DO SOME QUICK SPEED DATING WITH THE PROGRAM. WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY RELATIONSHIPS ARE KEY. PROGRAMS NEED TO BE INSIDE PRISONS PRIOR TO PEOPLE LEAVING SO THE RELATIONSHIPS THE TRUST IN THE COMMUNICATION CAN START BEFORE THEY GO HOME. AN WE THINK THAT THIS WOULD REALLY -- HELP THE POOR PEOPLE BEING MORE SUCCESSFUL. MY LAST COMMENT. ON WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THIS WORK IT WENT IN AS A VOLUNTEER I MET A GENTLEMAN SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE. TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO COME FROM HIGH DESERT PRISON TO SAN QUENTIN. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE FEELING OF BEING DEAD AND THEN COMING BACK TO LIFE. THAT'S WHAT MOTIVATES THE WORK WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO WITH THAT. I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE. FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO THANK OUR TWO WITNESSES FOR SHARING. YOUR INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO US AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR GOOD QUESTIONS. AND THIS WAS INFORMATIONAL BUT OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO BE. BEFORE. ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. WALKING DOWN ON SOME. APPROPRIATIONS FOR OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND JUST OUR GENERAL CORRECTIONS BUDGET SO I THINK A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED TODAY WILL HELP INFORM US AS WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR NEXT ITEM. IN THANKS SO MUCH. IN OUR NEXT ITEM -- RELATES TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE WERE ABLE LAST YEAR TO SECURE IN THE BUDGET. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR REENTRY. A SUPPORTING VERSION SUPPORT. AND WAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON HOUSING SUPPORT WHICH WE'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE FOR WHEN PEOPLE ARE. RELEASED ON AND WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR TODAY FROM OUR BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. IN RELATIONSHIP TO THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE APPROVED LAST YEAR IS [inaudible] OF WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE R. F. P. FOR THAT MONEY IS OUT IN THE FIELD NOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS. WHAT OUR -- WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE? OF MEANING THE INTEREST SO FAR RATE WHAT'S BEEN THE INTEREST. WHAT'S YOUR TIME LINE FOR AWARDING GRAHAM LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PROCESS. SO. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BSE SEE GETTING OVER A LITTLE COLD HERE FOR FOR GIVE ME. ON WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TODAY AND PROVIDE AN UPDATE -- I WANT TO THANK YOU IN PARTICULAR SENATOR SKINNER THIS WAS YOUR PROPOSAL FROM LAST YEAR THE ADULT RE ENTRY GRANT. AND THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS -- FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE -- ADMINISTERS A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT SORTS OF GRANTS THIS ADULT RE ENTRY PROGRAM WAS ON SIMILAR TO OTHER KINDS OF GRANTS THAT THE BOARD IS ADMINISTERING AND SO I THINK OUR OUR EXPERTISE WAS RECOGNIZED IN TERMS OF RECEIVING THIS FUNDING. ON THERE IS THE R. F. P. WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JANUARY AND WAS PUT OUT INTO THE FIELD THOSE PROPOSALS ARE ACTUALLY DO NEXT MONDAY THERE HAS BEEN IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR A TREMENDOUS. AMOUNT OF INTEREST OF FROM THE FIELD WE ASK PEOPLE TO SUBMIT A LETTER OF INTENT TO APPLY IN THOSE LETTERS OF INTENT WERE DUE IN FEBRUARY WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT INDICATIONS OF IN AN INTENTION TO APPLY. THERE COULD BE FEWER THERE COULD BE MORE THAT LETTER OF INTENT BUT WE JUST FOR PURPOSES OF PLANNING OUR WORK WE LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT HOW MANY -- APPLICATIONS ARE RATHER PROPOSALS TO EXPECT -- CENTER SKINNER OF COURSE WAS ABLE TO COME TO ONE OF THE FIRST EXECUTIVES DURING COMMITTEES LAST FALL AND SHARE HER VISION FOR THIS. ON THE COMPONENTS FOR FINDING THAT ARE OUT IN THE FELD RIGHT NOW ARE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE CAN APPLY. FOR SO INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS CAN APPLY FOR UP TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES OVER THE APPROXIMATELY THREE YEAR GRANT PERIOD. AND THEN IN ADDITION THERE IS NINE POINT THREE FIVE MILLION FOR WARM HAND OFF SERVICES AND ALSO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE MEANT WHEN WE SAID THOSE TWO THINGS -- WHEN THOSE? GRAMS CAN REQUEST UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GRANT PERIOD -- WE HAVE RECEIVED LIKE I SAID A HUNDRED MORE THAN A HUNDRED SIXTY MORE OF CONTINUE TO COME IN MY TEAM HAS TOLD ME FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE. ON THE FORTY STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS FORMED AN EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE WHICH IS ACTUALLY CHAIRED BY THE CHAIR OF OUR BOARD LINDA TANNER. ON THE EXPERTISE ON THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE IS JUST TREMENDOUS INCLUDING FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ON POLICY EXPERT ON HOUSING -- IT'S IT'S JUST A TREMENDOUS GROUP I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT ROSTER ON WITH YOU MISTER FRANCIS IF YOU LIKED YOUR WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON SO -- THE THE APPLICATIONS AS I MENTIONED ARE DUE NEXT MONDAY AND THERE'S A RATHER ON BROAD RANGE OF LINES OF SERVICES THAT CAN BE A FIVE OR SO FOCUSING FIRST ON THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT. WE PROVIDED A LIST AND THE COMMITTEE HAD. DEEP DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ALL OF THIS THEY WANTED -- TO PUT SOME BROAD PARAMETER AND THEN BECAUSE IT IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM BASICALLY SEE HOW THE FIELD RESPONDED WE HAVE A A PROCESS BY WHICH THERE ARE READING CRITERIA BUILT INTO THE R. F. P.. THE PROPOSALS WILL BE SCORED AND THE AWARDS WILL BE MADE AT THE BOARD MEETING IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. SO THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES COULD INCLUDE AND ARE NOT LIMITED TO SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING ASSISTANCE LANDLORD INCENTIVES RENT SUBSIDIES VOUCHERS MOVING COSTS. AVERAGE OF BACK GRANT STIPENDS TO FAMILIES WHO ARE WILLING TO HOUSE OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF STATE PRISON. ON TRANSITIONAL HOUSING -- BROAD RANGE OF RENTAL RELATED -- A NEEDS AND THEN ON THE WARM HAND OFF AND IT WAS EALLY INTERESTING TO NOTE ON THE WARM HAND OFF IS A NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR. PART OF FUNDING AND WE RECEIVED -- EVEN MORE LETTERS OF INTENT FOR THAT WARM HAND OFF -- RE ENTRY SERVICE PART OF THE R. F. P. SO THOSE SERVICES CAN INCLUDE AND MANY OF THE SPEAKERS ON THE LAST PANEL AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT YOU'VE JUST RECEIVED ON TOUCHED ON THE KINDS OF RE ENTRY SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED. SO IT CAN INCLUDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES I THINK THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT -- THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS ENTIRE GRANT PROGRAM. ON THE ONLY ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ARE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING TODAY. IT CAN INCLUDE CASE MANAGEMENT REGION SERVICES TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS WHEN SOMEONE IS PREPARING ON TO TO LEAVE STATE PRISON HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES TRANSPORTATION FOOD EMERGENCY SERVICES EMPLOYMENT VOCATIONAL SOCIAL SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. MENTOR SYSTEM -- AND SYSTEM NOW THE AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE AS THEY COME IN BUT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO LAY OUT WHAT THEY PROPOSE IN TERMS OF CASE MANAGEMENT. BASED NEEDS ASSESSMENT SO THAT PEOPLE TO RE ENTRY. AND THE MATCH SO I'D LIKE TO STOP THERE AND SEE WHAT QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT. MORRELL A WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TALK SOME ABOUT IS THE THE FOCUS OF THE WELL IT WAS YES TERM REENTRY SUPPORT THE FOCUS WAS. ON RECOGNIZING THAT HOUSING IS SUCH A CRITICAL NEED AND SO DIFFICULT. HIGH COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA -- THAT ALREADY IS A HUGE BARRIER BUT ADDITIONALLY -- AS A PERSON WITH THE RECORD -- MOST LANDLORDS IF THEY DO A BACKGROUND CHECK AREN'T REALLY JUMPING UP AND DOWN TO ONE A RENT TO YOU -- AND ANYWAY SO -- A GOOD AMOUNT OF OUR MOTIVATION WAS TO PROVIDE -- AS MUCH HOUSING SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE AND THE GRANT AS YOU MENTIONED DID DO THE RENTAL BUT WHAT PROBLEMS DID YOU ENCOUNTER IN. THE ADMINISTERING OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TRYING TO FIND GOOD HOUSING SUPPORT. ON WELL I WOULD SAY THAT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT OF THE R. F. P. ON WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN WHAT THOSE PROPOSED IT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TALK BROADER BECAUSE THE REASON IT'S ONLY RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN OURS. HE ISN'T AS OF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU ENCOUNTER OKAY WE REALLY HAD BROADER IN MINE RIGHT AB SIDE THE BOARD CHOSE TO LIMITED. AND SO I WANT THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS LIMóN OKAY SURE I CAN DO THAT SENATOR ON SO ONE OF THE COMPONENTS AT A AT A THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS GRANT WAS TO BE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE REHABILITATION OF EXISTING PROPERTY TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF STATE PRISON. AND AS THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE -- ENDEAVOR THROUGH SEVERAL MEETINGS IN THE FALL THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND POLICY AND ON MONITORING QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT INTERNALLY AND AND IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE. ON HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD ON THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS TO HAVE DONE A FAIRLY-EXTENSIVE. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND SOME OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVIDING -- HOUSING IS SOMETHING AS ONE EXAMPLE JUST ONE EXAMPLE IS IS IF IF THERE'S A REHABILITATION PROJECT THAT THE STATE IS FUNDING -- THERE COULD BE A RESPONSIBILITY TO COVER RELOCATION THIS IS FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE THERE'S TO BE. ON A REMODEL OR YOU KNOW SOME SOME IMPROVEMENTS MADE AND SO WE WANTED TO BE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO FELT LIKE AND AND AND IN CONSULTATION WITH YOUR OFFICE SENATOR THAT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. ON THE OTHER TWO COMPONENTS THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND THE WARM HAND OFF WHICH WERE A LITTLE BIT LESS COMPLEX LEGALLY AND IN TERMS OF THE MONEY. AND ALL THAT SO WHILE I THINK WE CAN YOU KNOW MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT HOW THE REHABILITATION OF EXISTING PER IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. JUST FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO THE BEFORE THE RFP WAS DEVELOPED. WE HAD HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF NONPROFITS IN DIFFERENT. ALL CALM AGENCY THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY GOVERNMENT BASS THOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD RECEIVED GOVERNMENT FUNDING. THAT -- BASICALLY WERE. WHAT THEY DID WAS PROVIDE? IN FACT. ALL SEE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING BUT IT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN WE HEARD FROM OUR OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKER SO WASN'T RESTRICTIVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WAS MORE. LIKE HOUSING LITERALLY FOR REENTRY FOLKS AND THAT WAS THE THE VERY. A MISSION THAT THOSE NONPROFITS WERE INVOLVED IN AN AMITY COMES TO MIND THERE'S OTHERS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE IS THAT THERE WERE PROPERTIES THAT WERE AVAILABLE BUT WHAT THEY NEEDED WAS THE MONEY TO PUT HIM INTO SHAPE. TO TO THEN HOUSE MORE PEOPLE AND SUCH. AND SO IN THE CONSTRUCTION -- ORIGINALLY OF THE R. P. THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS FUNDING THAT. BUT WHAT WE ENCOUNTERED WERE A VARIETY OF WE JUST ENCOUNTERED A VARIETY OF LEGAL ISSUES AND THEY WORK IT'S NOT THAT STATE FUNDING CAN'T DO THAT IT WAS MORE. THAT OUR WE HAVE SOME AGENCIES THAT ARE USED TO THAT. AND THEY HAVE A CERTAIN -- PROCEDURES AND THEN OF COURSE BSE SEE HAD NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE AND SO SHOULD WE HAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF THE OTHER AGENCIES SO THEY WERE JUST ISSUES LIKE THAT WHICH AT SOME POINT WE DON'T HAVE -- TO HAVE THAT ALL PRESENTED NOW BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME KIND SOMETHING. IN WRITING ONLY SO THAT IF WE INTEND. TO MOVE FORWARD IF WE WERE SO -- SUCCESSFULLY GETTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DESIGN IT SO THAT THIS WAS NOT AN OBSTACLE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS. FOR GO AHEAD -- ONE OF THE LOWER THE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FUNDING. ON THE HOUSING AND OR I ASSUME THAT. YOU'RE. GOING TO HAVE THESE APPLICANTS SHOW HOW THEY'RE APPLYING. FOR OTHER FUNDS AND MAYBE LEVERAGE THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE -- HAVING. TO BE USED FOR LIKE FEDERAL FUNDS THE OTHER STATE FUNDS. THAT ARE OUT THERE LOCAL HOUSING FUNDS. OF THAT THEY NEED LIKE IF THEY WANTED TO DO REAL BILL TATIAN THAT COULD GO TO THE YOU KNOW THE LOCAL HOUSING. PROGRAMS THAT FUND THAT KIND OF STUFF THIS CD BG. FEDERAL PROGRAM FUNDS RE -- SO DO THE WHEN YOU VALUE ITEM TO THE SHOW -- OTHER USING THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE LINE FOR WITH YOU TO LEVERAGE. GETTING SOME OF THOSE OTHER GRANTS. ON THE PART OF IT -- I'M JUST SCANNING VERY YOU KNOW IRAN SAYING I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CENTER IN GETTING THROUGH ARE. THE BASIC RATING CRITERIA WE TALK ABOUT LET'S SEE HERE ORIGINALLY. AND IN THE BUDGET INFORMATION WE GENERALLY ASK THE APPLICANTS TO TALK ABOUT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT ARE BEING LEVERAGED -- SO I CAN GIVE YOU -- FURTHER DETAIL AFTER OF A YOUNG WORK PLACED IT IN THE R. F. P. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TYPICALLY DO IS TALK ABOUT LEVERAGING FUNDING AND IN. SO WILL YOU WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT. LIKE WE HAVE LIKE PROGRAMS -- LIKE PROPOSITION ONE WE PASSED LAST YEAR -- THE BOND FUND. AS MONEY FOR THIS THING -- IT HAS MONEY -- FOR US SUPPORT OF HOUSING. RIGHT OF PROGRAMS -- WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT A HOUSING UNIT WITH. YOU KNOW CRAZY A I DON'T THINK THE REALLY BIG. PROJECTS OR ANYTHING BUT MAYBE -- OF A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE MAYBE. SIX PEOPLE. SMALL -- THEY HAVE A HOUSE IN EITHER MAYBE FIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT IS THAT WOULD KIND OF WHEN YOU SAY RE AB THAT'S ARTS CENTER WAS SO SO -- SOMETIMES THESE FUNDS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. JUST SAY HAVE LIKE LESS THERE YEARS. ABSOLUTELY -- AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN USE THOSE FUNDS FOR SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND MAYBE THE MONEY YOU HAVE. FOR THE WHAT HE CALLED THE WARM HAND OFF YEAH THAT. ONE THE SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS RIGHT LAST WEEK'S WILL JUST ONE I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW I THINK YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL IS TO LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE USING THE OTHER FUNDS. EVERY EVERY LARGE COUNTY HAS OF A FUN LIKE THIS I MEAN ORANGE COUNTY DOES. SET MY COUNTY SAN JOSE DOES. OR MEDIA. ALL THE COUNTIES HAVE THESE HOUSING FUNDS. AND THE THEIR FUNDS ARE PRETTY PRETTY. FLEXIBLE IN THEIR USE RIGHT NOW FOR THESE KINDS OF SERVICES OKAY SO YOU CAN YOU CAN -- YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE MONEY YOU HAVE HERE. FOR THESE APPLICANTS -- VERY WELL I THINK IF YOU YOU SET THAT UP RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I AND I ALSO THINK THAT THAT REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW THAT THEY EXPECTED DURING COMMITTEE ITSELF WILL BE THE ONES. REVIEWING AND RATING THE PROPOSAL'S YOU KNOW I I IS STAFF DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THAT BUT WHAT I ANTICIPATE WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THOSE PROPOSALS. IS A CLEAR. INDICATION FROM THE PEOPLE ON WINE FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE TARGET. AND IN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING HOUSING NEEDS THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AND IT AS A MATTER OF A POLICY BASIS I THINK IT'S ALSO. HELPFUL THINGS THAT WAS -- IMPORTANT FOR OUR EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE THE WELL BRIEFED ON BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF HOUSING FOR WHICH I THINK MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE. FAMILIAR WITH AND IT IS A A POLICY THAT SAYS THAT. THE FUNDING FOR THE HOUSING AND THE THE THE YOU KNOW THE THE THE HOUSING RELATED SERVICES AND SUBSIDIES. HAVE TO BE PROVIDED PEOPLE WITH OUT STRINGS ATTACHED SO JUST YOU KNOW IN IN PART IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENT SENATOR ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW THERE CAN'T BE A REQUIREMENT THAT SOMEONE. HAS TO BE SOBER IN IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE HOUSING SERVICES IT IT IS ON SEPT THAT HOUSING AS TO BE PROVIDED FIRST SO THAT THAT LEVEL OF FOUNDATION IS -- PROVIDED FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S. COMING OUT OF STATE PRISON. ORDER TO PURSUE YOUR TREATMENT IF YOU ARE NOT HOUSE STUFF. YEAH ANY QUESTIONS FURTHER. OKAY WELL WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO HEARING ABOUT HOW MANY APPLICATIONS AT ACTUAL PROPOSALS ARE RECEIVED. AND WHETHER THE AMOUNT REQUESTED IS. YOU KNOW ABOUT AROUND WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE OR QUADRUPLE TIME. INTERSIL ITEM MORE I'LL BE AND THEN -- YEAH SO MUCH. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THEN WE WILL. OF OUR SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE WILL STAND. ADJOURNED
