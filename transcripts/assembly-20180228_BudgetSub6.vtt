00:34:51.056 --> 00:34:53.325 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:55.393 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE.

00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:57.095 region:rollup2
.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:58.396 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY THE STATE BUT OTHER

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:59.798 region:rollup2
PARTNERS ARE INVESTING IN RIGHT

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:01.800 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WILL BE COMING OUT

00:34:59.798 --> 00:35:03.969 region:rollup2
LATER THIS YEAR THAT WILL THERE

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.704 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THAT THE PROVIDES DOWN

00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:07.172 region:rollup2
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD TYPE DATA.

00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:09.474 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:35:07.172 --> 00:35:10.909 region:rollup2
ARE SO THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:13.178 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SHOULD WE WE EXPECTED

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:14.512 region:rollup2
IN ON A COASTAL COMMUNITY VERSES

00:35:13.178 --> 00:35:16.648 region:rollup2
THE TEMPERATURE INCHED INCREASES

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:18.350 region:rollup2
THAT WILL EXPERIENCE. UP IN THE

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:19.551 region:rollup2
M. UP IN THE UP IN THE FOOTHILLS

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.753 region:rollup2
UP TO THE MOUNTAINS.

00:35:19.551 --> 00:35:23.455 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT THAT IS REALLY

00:35:21.753 --> 00:35:24.923 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALLOWS THOSE

00:35:23.455 --> 00:35:25.457 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE STATE PROGRAMS

00:35:24.923 --> 00:35:27.425 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:28.860 region:rollup2
ENTIRE STATE. IT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:30.495 region:rollup2
MODIFY THEIR PROGRAMS IN A WAY

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.963 region:rollup2
THAT THAT REALLY IS RESPONSIVE

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:33.264 region:rollup2
TO THE CONDITIONS AT HAND AND

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:34.466 region:rollup2
THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY EXPECT

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:37.102 region:rollup2
TO TO SEE IN THE FUTURE.

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:39.337 region:rollup2
.

00:35:37.102 --> 00:35:41.339 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO BUILDING BEHIND THAT

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:43.842 region:rollup2
SCIENCE WE'RE BUILDING. TOOLS

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:46.144 region:rollup2
ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO ALLOW THESE

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:47.912 region:rollup2
POP POLICYMAKERS TO SEE VISUALLY

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:49.681 region:rollup2
AND SPATIALLY HOW THOSE IMPACTS

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:51.383 region:rollup2
WILL BE IMPACTING THEM AND THOSE

00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.017 region:rollup2
TOOLS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO THE

00:35:51.383 --> 00:35:52.717 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS

00:35:52.017 --> 00:35:54.619 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:56.287 region:rollup2
SO.

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.822 region:rollup2
I THINK THE STORY OF HOW HOW THE

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:59.124 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDING PLAN WAS DEVELOPED

00:35:57.822 --> 00:36:00.558 region:rollup2
IS ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE

00:35:59.124 --> 00:36:02.027 region:rollup2
CONTENT OF THE PLAN.

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:03.495 region:rollup2
THE PLAN ITSELF THE NATURAL

00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:05.230 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AGENCIES IS DIRECTED

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.498 region:rollup2
BY STATUTE TO ORGANIZE

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.433 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION OF THIS PLAN BUT IT

00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:10.268 region:rollup2
REALLY IS. IT REALLY IS A A

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:11.903 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE DOCUMENT THAT YOU KNOW

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:13.405 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE HAVE CONTROL OVER OUR

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:15.607 region:rollup2
CHANNEL BUT WE DON'T. QUITE HAVE

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:16.775 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO TO TO DICTATE HOW

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:19.310 region:rollup2
OTHER AGENCIES DO THEIR BUSINESS

00:36:16.775 --> 00:36:20.779 region:rollup2
SO WE ENGAGED IN AN IN AN

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.347 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED.

00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:24.182 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE COLLABORATED

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:25.750 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ACROSS

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:26.951 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT ALMOST OVER

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.054 region:rollup2
THIRTY DIFFERENT STATE

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:31.756 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES.

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:33.858 region:rollup2
GUM CONTRIBUTING TO THIS BOOK.

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:35.860 region:rollup2
AND WORK AND I AM.

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:37.595 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SOCIALIZING ASPECT

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.264 region:rollup2
IS FOR ME IS ONE OF THE

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:41.166 region:rollup2
STRONGEST TAKEAWAYS IS THAT YOU

00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:43.101 region:rollup2
KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:44.502 region:rollup2
REALLY SEEN A SHIFT WHERE. IN

00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:46.371 region:rollup2
THE PAST THAT THE CLIMATE THE

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:47.105 region:rollup2
CLIMATE PLANNING ELEMENTS OF OUR

00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:48.506 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES AND STATE

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:49.908 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS. AND A LOT OF WAYS

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:50.942 region:rollup2
IS REALLY SILENT OFF FROM THAT

00:36:49.908 --> 00:36:52.711 region:rollup2
FROM THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.611 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS GO

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:55.013 region:rollup2
THEN ENGAGE IN.

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:56.614 region:rollup2
AND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:58.183 region:rollup2
ARE THESE THIS KIND OF THIS

00:36:56.614 --> 00:37:00.985 region:rollup2
TIGHTER INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE

00:36:58.183 --> 00:37:02.153 region:rollup2
CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND IN IN THE

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:03.121 region:rollup2
THE EVERYDAY PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2
OVER AGENCIES.

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:11.496 region:rollup2
.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.098 region:rollup2
WE STRUCTURE THIS PLAN MUCH LIKE

00:37:11.496 --> 00:37:14.466 region:rollup2
A BUDGET IS STRUCTURED WE WE

00:37:13.098 --> 00:37:17.469 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED AROUND.

00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:19.237 region:rollup2
STE ELEVEN KEY POLICY AREAS SO

00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:21.339 region:rollup2
THING OF A FEW MORE THAN THE SUB

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:23.441 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES BUT WE WE BATCH THEM

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:24.075 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS LIKE THEIR PASSED

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:25.977 region:rollup2
IN SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:28.246 region:rollup2
WE ORGANIZED AROUND PROGRAM

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:30.281 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN POLICIES

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:31.516 region:rollup2
SO SO IT YOU KNOW YOU WHEN YOU

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:33.985 region:rollup2
READ TO THE PLAN YOU'LL SEE

00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:35.987 region:rollup2
THINGS LOOK A LOT LIKE. BCP'S

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:36.454 region:rollup2
AND AND AND NEXT YOU KNOW AND AN

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.190 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE REPORTS.

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:41.025 region:rollup2
.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.628 region:rollup2
WE.

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:46.064 region:rollup2
IN EACH POLICY AREA WE WE WE WE

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:47.398 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH COME HIGH LEVEL

00:37:46.064 --> 00:37:49.767 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEMES IN

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:51.002 region:rollup2
THAT WE BUILT. WE BUILT OUT

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.170 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS UNDERNEATH THAT

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:54.239 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROGRAMS.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.373 region:rollup2
AND.

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:57.242 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT REALLY IS

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:58.610 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO DOIS TO GIVE GIVE

00:37:57.242 --> 00:37:59.344 region:rollup2
THOSE INTERESTED IN DIFFERENT

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.979 region:rollup2
POLICY AREAS.

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:03.648 region:rollup2
.

00:38:00.979 --> 00:38:04.716 region:rollup2
JUST A WAY TO TO WHEN THEY ASK

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:05.717 region:rollup2
WHEN THE YOU KNOW WHEN THEY HAVE

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:07.352 region:rollup2
THE TIME TO ASK THE QUESTION ARE

00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:09.420 region:rollup2
WE PREPARED TO RESPOND CLIMATE

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:11.189 region:rollup2
CHANGE. IN THIS SPECIFIC POLICY

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.624 region:rollup2
AREA IT REALLY GIVES THAT PERSON

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:14.058 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINT START ASKING QUESTIONS

00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:16.394 region:rollup2
OF DRILLING DOWN AND PUSHING ON

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:17.662 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES AND AND AND HOLDING

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:19.364 region:rollup2
HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE.

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:20.932 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES I WANTED

00:38:19.364 --> 00:38:22.767 region:rollup2
TO TALK YOU THROUGH IN THE PLANT

00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:24.369 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST ME TALKING BUT.

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:26.171 region:rollup2
I THINK THE FIRST ONE I WANTED

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:27.572 region:rollup2
TO TURN TO IS ON PAGE.

00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:28.873 region:rollup2
I'M JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW THE

00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:30.909 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLAN IS STRUCTURED.

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:32.243 region:rollup2
.

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:33.645 region:rollup2
AND GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THEY

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:35.613 region:rollup2
CONNECT ACROSS POTS HERE IS THE

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:36.247 region:rollup2
FIRST ONE WAS IN THE M.

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.282 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SECTION OF

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:39.884 region:rollup2
PAGE SIX

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:41.152 region:rollup2
TWO. AND IT WOULD BE TITLED IN

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:43.988 region:rollup2
THIS IS VERY WANT KIDS FEDERAL

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:45.657 region:rollup2
E. M. DASH THREE POINT ONE D..

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.791 region:rollup2
AND AND AND THERE'S THERE'S A

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
METHOD TO THAT LABELING BUT I'M

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.394 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.994 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING IT SAYS

00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:51.396 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE CLIMATE

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:52.964 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION DROUGHT AND

00:38:51.396 --> 00:38:54.032 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY PLANNING

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.166 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY GENERAL

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:56.634 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THE NET THEN

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:58.269 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE THE WATER MARK NEXT

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
TO IT. IN THE WATER SECTION OF

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:01.306 region:rollup2
THE PLANE YOU'LL SEE FOLLOW

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:03.641 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MATCH THAT.

00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:04.242 region:rollup2
IN AN THOSE TOGETHER YOU KNOW

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.410 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT'S BEING ON THE

00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:07.045 region:rollup2
GROUND HAS EMERGED. THE OFFICE

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.545 region:rollup2
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WORK IN

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:11.482 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND REALLY BUILDING UP

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.884 region:rollup2
LOCAL PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE.

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:14.352 region:rollup2
TO THE FLOOD RISKS THAT WE SEE

00:39:12.884 --> 00:39:15.620 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IN OUR MAJOR RIVER WAYS

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:17.555 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN THE URBAN WATER

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.656 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT ARE ARE MANY TIMES

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:21.159 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE UNPREDICTABLE.

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:22.861 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THE NEXT ONE HOPEFULLY

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:25.763 region:rollup2
AND. I HAVE SOME TIME PUBLIC

00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:27.665 region:rollup2
HEALTH ON PAGE ONE OF FIVE.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:29.534 region:rollup2
THE HIGH LEVEL THE HIGH LEVEL

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:31.236 region:rollup2
GOAL HERE IS TO ESTABLISH AN

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:34.305 region:rollup2
IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN ROBUST

00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:35.506 region:rollup2
SURVEILLANCE MECHANISMS.

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:37.008 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.475 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:39.410 region:rollup2
IS REALLY.

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:41.179 region:rollup2
IS MAKING SURE YOU HAVE EYES ON

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.647 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:43.982 region:rollup2
THESE CHANGES ARE IMPACTING OUR

00:39:42.647 --> 00:39:46.451 region:rollup2
ARE THE PEOPLE AND THE

00:39:43.982 --> 00:39:48.253 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT. YOU KNOW.

00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:49.721 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL AROUND US AND. YOU

00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:52.357 region:rollup2
KNOW THOSE THOSE SIGNALS ARE NOT

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:53.424 region:rollup2
ALWAYS OBVIOUS SO. IN HERE WE

00:39:52.357 --> 00:39:56.561 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:57.695 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS TO TO TO TO GIVE

00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:58.730 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:39:57.695 --> 00:40:00.131 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TRACK THESE

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.366 region:rollup2
IMPACT IS THAT GOING TO THE

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:03.434 region:rollup2
CONCERT MONITORING THEM.

00:40:01.366 --> 00:40:04.769 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LAST.

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.903 region:rollup2
I HAVE ONE MORE

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.673 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION BUT I THINK MIGHT

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:11.576 region:rollup2
HAVING SYSTEMS.

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:13.011 region:rollup2
LOG OF THE LAST ONE BECAUSE I.

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.946 region:rollup2
IN OCEANS IN CO STEM PAGE ONE

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.981 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO. THERE'S A WHOLE

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:18.583 region:rollup2
SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:20.285 region:rollup2
PLANNING AN ADAPTATION TO

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:21.119 region:rollup2
REDUCE HAZARDS TO INCREASE

00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:22.887 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE OF COASTAL

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.722 region:rollup2

DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER RESOURCES.

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:28.793 region:rollup2
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ARM.

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:30.061 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IS THIS.

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.428 region:rollup2
NEAR THE ISSUES OF SEA LEVEL

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:32.230 region:rollup2
RISING COASTAL.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:33.498 region:rollup2
.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.899 region:rollup2
COSTA RESILIENCY COULD I SPREAD

00:40:33.498 --> 00:40:36.501 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT BUT WHEN

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:38.736 region:rollup2
YOU START TO LOOK AT THE ICONS

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:40.772 region:rollup2
NEXT TO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:42.373 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY SEE HOW THOSE LINK TO

00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:43.741 region:rollup2
POLICY AREAS THAT. YOU KNOW SEA

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:45.043 region:rollup2
LEVEL RISE IS OFTEN TALKED ABOUT

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:46.577 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND

00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:48.046 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE THREE BUT SEA LEVEL

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:49.380 region:rollup2
RISE REALLY SHOULD BE TALKED

00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:51.449 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN EVERY SUBCOMMITTEE AS

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.051 region:rollup2
IT AS IT IMPACTS THOSE. POLICY

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.385 region:rollup2
AREAS AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO AND

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:56.120 region:rollup2
IT'S BETTER ONLINE WE YOU KNOW

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.555 region:rollup2
WE WE TRIED IT WE LINK THESE

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.957 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS TO OTHER

RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE PUBLIC

00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:01.426 region:rollup2
CAN. CONTRACT THAT AS A BECAUSE

.

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:09.701 region:rollup2
SO THE LAST THING I WANTED TO

00:41:06.998 --> 00:41:12.503 region:rollup2
POINT OUT WAS WE. WE DID ALL WE

00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:14.272 region:rollup2

REALLY ARE GONNA THE HARD AGO

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:44.435 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN CLIMATE IMPACTS COME

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:46.137 region:rollup2
INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES HOW DO

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.972 region:rollup2
YOU. HOW DO YOU BUILD UP TO

00:41:46.137 --> 00:41:49.540 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO? TO MAKE SURE

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:51.075 region:rollup2
THAT THUMBED THEIR NEEDS ARE

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.977 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED BUT ALSO THAT THERE

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:53.578 region:rollup2
THEIR VOICES ARE CAPTURED IN THE

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.245 region:rollup2
PLANNING PROCESS ARE GOING TO

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:55.313 region:rollup2
HAPPEN.

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.980 region:rollup2
ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT POLICY

00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:57.582 region:rollup2
AREAS OVER TIME.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:01.219 region:rollup2
.

00:41:57.582 --> 00:42:02.787 region:rollup2
WE HAD. SO ONE PAGE THIRTY ONE.

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:04.756 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE THIRTY PITCH THIRTY

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:07.225 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE THE CLIMATE JUSTICE

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:07.792 region:rollup2
CHAPTER I'M IS THE PRODUCT OF

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:08.393 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION WITH

00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:10.895 region:rollup2
THE.

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:12.897 region:rollup2
.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:14.465 region:rollup2
WITH THE

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.999 region:rollup2
CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKING GROUP

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.601 region:rollup2
HAS HAVE A LOT OF WORKING

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.869 region:rollup2
GROUP'S MAP BUT THE THE CLIMATE

00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:19.570 region:rollup2
JUSTICE WORKING GROUP WHICH HAD.

00:42:17.869 --> 00:42:21.205 region:rollup2
WHICH HAD PARTICIPANTS FROM

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.774 region:rollup2
FROM NGOS CROSS THE STATE IN

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:24.008 region:rollup2
THOSE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:25.309 region:rollup2
SCHOLARSHIPS BY THE BY THE

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.878 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION COMMUNITY TO

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:28.813 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE.

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:30.048 region:rollup2
THEY PROVIDED.

00:42:28.813 --> 00:42:33.117 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLE.

00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:35.153 region:rollup2
INPUT TO OUR INITIAL DRAFT AND

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:36.020 region:rollup2
WE REALLY WORKED WITH THEM TO T

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:36.554 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.321 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SPREAD

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:40.458 region:rollup2
ACROSS.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:42.226 region:rollup2
.

00:42:40.458 --> 00:42:43.895 region:rollup2
SO KIND OF WHAT COMES NEXT WITH

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:45.630 region:rollup2
THIS WE HAVE WE HAVE OVER A

00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:47.064 region:rollup2
THOUSAND RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.599 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE WHERE WE'VE WE'VE.

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.601 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF AND ALMOST A

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:51.602 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OF ONGOING ACTIONS

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.970 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT SO

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.272 region:rollup2
THERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE AN

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.572 region:rollup2
EFFORT THIS YEAR AND THIS ISN'T

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:56.641 region:rollup2
STATURE TO.

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:58.609 region:rollup2
TRACK

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:00.211 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:01.746 region:rollup2
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND I

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:03.748 region:rollup2
THINK THE CLOSEST THAT I CAN A

00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:05.483 region:rollup2
LINE THAT TO RIGHT NOW IS IS THE

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.784 region:rollup2
STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON THE

00:43:05.483 --> 00:43:07.985 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE ABILITY OF

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:10.121 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS TO MEET. AUDIT

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:11.689 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS SO WORRYING WORK

00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:13.791 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING DEEP INTO THAT THAT

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:14.959 region:rollup2
EXTREME DATA DIVE RIGHT NOW IF A

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.661 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRACK.

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:18.062 region:rollup2
EACH OF THESE AGENCIES AND HAVE

00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:19.931 region:rollup2
THEM TRUCK THEMSELVES AS PART OF

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:20.998 region:rollup2
THAT SOCIALIZING THAT BUT TOOL

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:22.400 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM FOCUSED ON THESE

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:24.035 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.336 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE REALLY IN THE

00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:26.804 region:rollup2
LEARNING PHASE RIGHT NOW OF HOW

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:28.673 region:rollup2
TO HOW TO TRACK PROGRESS SO. YOU

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:30.508 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'LL BE THIS YEAR IN THE

00:43:28.673 --> 00:43:32.543 region:rollup2
FUTURE WE MAY ONE AROUND THAT UP

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:33.811 region:rollup2
INTO SOMETHING MORE. MORE.

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:35.279 region:rollup2
GENERAL AND PROGRAMMATIC

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.813 region:rollup2
INFEASIBLE BUT. WE'RE NOT QUITE

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:38.249 region:rollup2
THERE YET.

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:39.517 region:rollup2
.

00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:41.953 region:rollup2
AND THEN LAST YOU KNOW.

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:43.521 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.022 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:45.923 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS PLAN IS THE QUESTION

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:49.060 region:rollup2
OF HOW SHOULD IT BE USED.

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:51.762 region:rollup2
.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.664 region:rollup2
ALL WE DESIGNED THIS DOCUMENT SO

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:54.765 region:rollup2
THAT IT IT. IT REALLY IS MEANT

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.666 region:rollup2
TO BE TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:58.302 region:rollup2
TOOL ACROSS GOVERNMENT.

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:59.737 region:rollup2
.

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.872 region:rollup2
AND IT SHOULD ANSWER THE

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.340 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR EVERYONE AND

00:44:00.872 --> 00:44:03.241 region:rollup2
WHATEVER DAY TO DAY BUSINESS

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.109 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WORK ON IN THIS

00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.377 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND AN ACROSS THE STATE

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:07.578 region:rollup2
ARE WE READY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:08.779 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ISN'T JUST AN

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.981 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE IT'S

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:11.482 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MULTIPLIES CROSS

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:14.118 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION HEALTH.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:16.387 region:rollup2
PARKS AND RECREATION CULTURE

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:18.556 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK.

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:20.057 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW MY

00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:21.459 region:rollup2
HOPE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:23.728 region:rollup2
REALLY USE THIS AS A AS A

00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:24.295 region:rollup2
CLIMATE LOANS AND WITH WITH WITH

00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:25.396 region:rollup2
YOU ALL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:28.032 region:rollup2
BUDGETS.

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:29.667 region:rollup2
AS A POLICY LENDS WHEN WE WHEN

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.502 region:rollup2
WE WHEN WE DRAFT BILLS WE LOOK

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.304 region:rollup2
AT PROPOSED PROGRAMS.

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:34.572 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:36.240 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO USE THIS AS A AS A

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:37.041 region:rollup2
TOOL TO REALLY PUSH ON STATE

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.243 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:41.012 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY SEE AREAS THAT WERE

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:42.880 region:rollup2
WERE QUITE FRANKLY LACKING HONOR

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.315 region:rollup2
THEY YOU KNOW. WHERE THEY SEE

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.684 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED?

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:47.985 region:rollup2
AND THEN LAST IN IN THIS IS

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.787 region:rollup2
REALLY THIS IS REALLY.

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:50.922 region:rollup2
TAKING OFF

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:52.657 region:rollup2
IN A WE'RE IN THIS WERE IN THE

00:44:50.922 --> 00:44:53.925 region:rollup2
STATE WIDE COLLECTIVE EFFORT

00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:56.527 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

00:44:53.925 --> 00:44:58.229 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THIS IS A DYNAMIC

00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:00.998 region:rollup2
CHANGING NEW.

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:02.433 region:rollup2
AREA PLANNING WERE WERE CHASING

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:04.202 region:rollup2
IN A TREND LINES THAT ARE THAT

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.036 region:rollup2
ARE NOT COMPLETELY STABLE HONOR

00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:07.371 region:rollup2
THEIR GOING UP AND DOWN.

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:09.674 region:rollup2
.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:10.908 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT THIS PLAN REALLY

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:11.976 region:rollup2
SERVES AS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:13.244 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER STATES WE

00:45:11.976 --> 00:45:15.813 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT. THAT OTHER

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:17.248 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS AMUSES AS A MODEL

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:19.216 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR OWN PLANNING EFFORTS.

00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:20.318 region:rollup2
BUT THEN YOU KNOW.

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:22.086 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY THAT'S REALLY WORKS

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:23.621 region:rollup2
AS A PHASES OF THE MODEL LEARN

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:25.957 region:rollup2
FROM US AND THEN DO A BETTER

00:45:23.621 --> 00:45:27.625 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES. AND WE CAN COME BACK

00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:29.560 region:rollup2
IN THREE YEARS WE'RE STATUTORILY

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:31.195 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THIS AND

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.730 region:rollup2
LEARN OFF AT THEIR WORK SO WE

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:33.631 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY STRONG COLLABORATIVE'S

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.766 region:rollup2
WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:36.801 region:rollup2
AROUND. ON THIS PLAN AND WHAT

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.569 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING IN AND THE WAY

00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:40.404 region:rollup2
THAT. WE'RE WE'RE SETTING UP OUR

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:42.373 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AS WELL HAVE THAT WILL

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.908 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT THAT FEEDBACK LOOP SO

00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:46.277 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEXT TIME WE COME.

00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:47.445 region:rollup2
TO DRAFT THIS DOCUMENT WE WILL

00:45:46.277 --> 00:45:48.512 region:rollup2

.

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:16.440 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO CONSOLIDATE THAT

00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:19.377 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND REALLY PROVIDE A

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.878 region:rollup2

CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE AND WHAT WE

00:46:25.283 --> 00:46:29.487 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO SEE IN THE IN THE IN

FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN THAT

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:37.762 region:rollup2
WE WILL JUST NEED TO REVISIT

00:46:36.861 --> 00:46:39.330 region:rollup2
THEM SO.

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:41.332 region:rollup2

OF THE REPORT.

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:10.327 region:rollup2
AND. ONE OF THE THINGS CONCERNS

00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:12.329 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE IS. THAT.

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:14.332 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE ALLOCATED A

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.366 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO

00:47:14.332 --> 00:47:17.601 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT

00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:18.502 region:rollup2
LARGE WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AND

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.204 region:rollup2
OTHER SECTION.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:21.772 region:rollup2
WAS READING IN THE NEXT STEPS

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:23.274 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:25.343 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING SUBSTANTIVE WATER

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:25.976 region:rollup2
STORAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS AND I

00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:27.445 region:rollup2
WONDERED WHAT THE

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:28.779 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO

00:47:27.445 --> 00:47:30.648 region:rollup2
THAT WAS GOING TO BE AND WHETHER

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:32.550 region:rollup2
NOT INCLUDED. ABOVE GROUND WATER

00:47:30.648 --> 00:47:34.552 region:rollup2
STORAGE PROJECTS.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:36.420 region:rollup2
SO SO THE WATER STORAGE.

00:47:34.552 --> 00:47:38.589 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY ARE OUR

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.024 region:rollup2
FOCUS IT STATEWIDE IN THEY THEY

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.992 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NAM.

00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:44.595 region:rollup2
INCLUDE.

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:46.397 region:rollup2
ABOVE GROUND STORAGE AND THEN

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:47.431 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CONDUCTIVE BELOW GROUND

00:47:46.397 --> 00:47:48.833 region:rollup2
STORAGE WHERE THOSE SYSTEMS

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.334 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE.

00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:52.403 region:rollup2
THIS DOCUMENT DOESN'T GET INTO

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:53.971 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES OF HOW THOSE TO

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:55.773 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU KNOW. THAT LEADS TO THE

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:57.575 region:rollup2
WATER OF THAT THE PROCESS IS IN

00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:58.442 region:rollup2
PLACE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.877 region:rollup2
STORAGE BUT IT'S A IT'S AN

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:01.779 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO FLAG. THE

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF OF HAVING THOSE

00:48:01.779 --> 00:48:05.182 region:rollup2
INSURANCE MECHANISMS IN THE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:07.184 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLIES YOU GIVE MAXIMIZE

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:08.853 region:rollup2
OUR WATER MANAGEMENT OPTIONS.

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:10.454 region:rollup2
SO YES IT DOES AND.

00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:11.922 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:13.257 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH THOSE AGENCIES ON

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:15.059 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A.

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:16.794 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT PANDA ANOTHER QUESTION

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:18.763 region:rollup2
THAT I HAD WAS ARE A REPRESENT A

00:48:16.794 --> 00:48:19.663 region:rollup2
VERY RURAL AREA OF THE STATE AND

00:48:18.763 --> 00:48:20.898 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOR INSTANCE

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:21.465 region:rollup2
MARTIN LUTHER SHARE YOUR

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.167 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT. FOR STANDING

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:25.302 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
THE REDUCTION OF THE POTENTIAL

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:27.772 region:rollup2
FOR CATASTROPHIC FIRE.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.839 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:30.040 region:rollup2
ARE BAD FOR THE CLIMATE AND BAD

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:32.176 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.611 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CONCERNED WHEN I READ

00:48:32.176 --> 00:48:34.812 region:rollup2
THE FOREST THINNING SECTION IT

00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:36.347 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WE HAVE TO PURSUE SOME

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:37.681 region:rollup2
THINNING BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:40.351 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE STATE'S.

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:42.586 region:rollup2
LACK OF CAPACITY FOR PROCESSING

00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:43.854 region:rollup2
THOSE THINNING PRODUCTS IN A WAY

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:45.322 region:rollup2
THAT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:47.258 region:rollup2
AND I WONDERED IF YOU HAD A PLAN

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:49.260 region:rollup2
FOR HOW TO INCREASE THE STATE'S

00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:50.861 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO THOSE.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.762 region:rollup2
FACT WE DO HAVE A PLAN I'M IN

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.030 region:rollup2
ITS IN ITS SHOULD BE RELEASED

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.264 region:rollup2
SHORTLY BUT WHERE WE'VE BEEN

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.731 region:rollup2
WORKING.

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:54.632 region:rollup2
.

00:48:53.731 --> 00:48:56.333 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:58.602 region:rollup2
ACROSS

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:59.804 region:rollup2
MANY AGENCIES STATE AND FEDERAL

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
AND DO SOME PUBLIC ON THE FORCE

00:48:59.804 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
CARBON PLAN.

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:06.143 region:rollup2
SPACE DEDICATED TO TO WHAT DO

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.945 region:rollup2
YOU DO WITH THE MATERIAL.

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:09.547 region:rollup2
.

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:10.514 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR BOTH OF THE BIOMASS

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:12.316 region:rollup2
SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE WOOD

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:13.384 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS SIDE WE ALSO WERE

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:15.052 region:rollup2
DIRECTED BY S. B. EIGHT FIFTY

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:16.387 region:rollup2
NINE IN THE TRAILER BILL TO.

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:18.122 region:rollup2
PUT TOGETHER THE WOOD PRODUCTS

00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:19.457 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP WHICH WHICH

00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:20.958 region:rollup2
DELIVERED RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE

00:49:19.457 --> 00:49:22.560 region:rollup2
BEGINNING THE AIR AND THAT. THAT

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.893 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP WAS REALLY

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.094 region:rollup2
TARGETED THAT.

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:26.263 region:rollup2
.

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:28.032 region:rollup2
THE NON ENERGY SIDE OF THE OF

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:29.567 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL QUESTIONS HOW DO

00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:31.035 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE DO YOU STIMULATE

00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:32.670 region:rollup2
MARKETS FOR THE USE OF THIS

00:49:31.035 --> 00:49:34.004 region:rollup2
MATERIAL WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN THAT

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.739 region:rollup2
THAT RAMP UP OF THINNING BECAUSE

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:37.041 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. THAT THE MATERIALS

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:38.709 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THAT ARE CLEARED IN THE

00:49:37.041 --> 00:49:39.944 region:rollup2
THINNING PROJECT ARE URNT IN

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:41.846 region:rollup2
OPEN PILES.

00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:44.281 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART IN THE

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:46.116 region:rollup2
FIELD SO HOW DO WE HAD WE HAD TO

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
USE THE THROUGH MASS TIMBER YOU

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:50.120 region:rollup2
KNOW STE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WOOD

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:51.355 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.823 region:rollup2
THERE MANY BENEFITS THAT ARE

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:54.458 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MARKET WALK

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:55.559 region:rollup2
LOOK PAULA FORD READING ABOUT

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2

IN PARTICULAR I'M CONCERNED

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:02.233 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEAKAGE BECAUSE WHEN WE

TAKE THAT THOSE WOOD PRODUCTS

00:50:02.233 --> 00:50:05.569 region:rollup2
AND WE TO SHIP THEM OFF TO CHINA

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:07.104 region:rollup2
OR WHEREVER THEY GO. AYE IF IF

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.305 region:rollup2
THOSE PRODUCTS ARE USED AND

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.740 region:rollup2
MARVELING UNFRIENDLY WAY IN

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:11.675 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES IT REALLY DOESN'T

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:14.178 region:rollup2
DO LOSS IS A GLOBAL CLIMATE ANY

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:17.948 region:rollup2

AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND.

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:31.262 region:rollup2
INVESTED SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.496 region:rollup2
INTO A FOUR STRING THE CAP AND

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:34.198 region:rollup2

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:37.134 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT SORT OF HAMPERED

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:39.570 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT WAS WHAT

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:41.372 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THE TREES EVEN AFTER.

FIXES FOR THESE.

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.509 region:rollup2
I'M WE ALSO PICKED UP TO

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.110 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ON REVIEW SINCE WE

SO WITH THAT I'M SEVENTIES AND

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:54.391 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SORT OF TARGET

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.692 region:rollup2

TANGIBLE PRODUCTS IN KIND OF A

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.033 region:rollup2
FLOW BASIS RIGHT THIS THIS SPELL

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:04.268 region:rollup2
WE WORKED REALLY CLOSELY. WITH

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:06.403 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGET COUNTERPARTS TO

00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:08.472 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:09.606 region:rollup2
OF ON THE BUDGET STRUCTURE FOR

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:11.909 region:rollup2
STATE HOSPITALS THE BUDGET

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:13.010 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE BINDER. AND THEN ALSO

00:55:11.909 --> 00:55:15.078 region:rollup2
ON THE SALARIES AND WAGES

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:16.513 region:rollup2
GALLEON WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:17.714 region:rollup2
IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY INTO THAT

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.917 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS I KNOW

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:21.318 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR. FOR

00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:22.719 region:rollup2
ELLIE O. COUNTERPARTS.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:24.087 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TACKLE

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:25.722 region:rollup2
SOME SOME BIG THINGS THEY WORK

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:26.723 region:rollup2
ON SOME STOPPING STUDIES IN THE

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:28.358 region:rollup2
PAST FEW YEARS ARE GOING TO BE

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:30.194 region:rollup2
TACKLING THOSE IN THE NEXT.

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:31.128 region:rollup2
FEW MONTHS SO SO THAT'S REALLY

00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
GONNA ONE IT'S GOING TO GO ON

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:34.498 region:rollup2
FOR AWHILE AND WE'RE GONNA SORT

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:35.933 region:rollup2
OF HAVE TANGIBLE TO LIBERAL

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:07.190 region:rollup2
I CALIFORNIA'S POINT TIME COUNTS

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:08.625 region:rollup2
ARE GOING UP AND OTHER GOING UP

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.158 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY SIXTEEN PERCENT

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.260 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE TERMS THE TOTAL

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:12.195 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.129 region:rollup2
OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.831 region:rollup2
WHERE THE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:16.833 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HOMELESS

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:17.467 region:rollup2
ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN THE STATE?

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.968 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:20.336 region:rollup2
WHILE THIS IS A STATE WIDE

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:21.638 region:rollup2
PHENOMENON JUST ABOUT EVERY AREA

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:22.572 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE THIS

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.107 region:rollup2
UPTICK.

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:25.608 region:rollup2
WE DO SEE SOME AREAS THAT HAVE

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPACTED OUR

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:28.177 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA COUNTY WENT UP BY. A

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.346 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE PERCENT YEAR OVER

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:32.215 region:rollup2
YEAR LA COUNTY WENT UP BY TWENTY

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:33.750 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.350 region:rollup2
AND SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION OF

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.585 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON HOW DO WE GET

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.420 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:38.988 region:rollup2
AND I I I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.223 region:rollup2
SORT OF START BY SAYING YOU KNOW

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:41.324 region:rollup2
THERE IS A COURT CHALLENGE HERE

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.692 region:rollup2
WHICH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT I'VE

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.193 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT WITH THIS COMMITTEE

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.862 region:rollup2
AND IN THE PAST WHICH IS. A

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:47.931 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS SYSTEMATICALLY

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:49.232 region:rollup2
CHRONICALLY UNDER BUILDING HOMES

01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:50.566 region:rollup2
AND HAS BEENFOR A PERIOD OF

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.901 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE DECADES.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.770 region:rollup2
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AND

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.605 region:rollup2
THE MULTI FAMILY AND AFFORDABLE

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.107 region:rollup2
HOUSING AREA.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:59.609 region:rollup2
ARE WE'VE AVERAGED STATEWIDE

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:01.511 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:03.046 region:rollup2
HOMES PER YEAR OVER THE LAST

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:04.380 region:rollup2
COUPLE DECADES.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.715 region:rollup2
BUT LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT BY

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.116 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAD PROJECTED WE KNEW

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:08.518 region:rollup2
WE NEEDED TO BE BE BUILDING TO

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.685 region:rollup2
KEEP PACE.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.386 region:rollup2
AND.

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:12.522 region:rollup2
.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:14.257 region:rollup2
IN THE LOWER INCOME PORTION.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.391 region:rollup2
OUR DATA THAT WE RECEIVED FROM

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.359 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES EVERY YEAR

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.859 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR ANNUAL PROGRESS

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
REPORTS THIS PARTICULAR

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.829 region:rollup2
TROUBLING.

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:21.230 region:rollup2
IN THIS CURRENT REGIONAL

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:22.865 region:rollup2
HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION CYCLE

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:24.334 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE ONLY PRODUCED SEVEN

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:25.802 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:28.338 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE KNEW WE NEEDED IN THE

01:08:25.802 --> 01:08:30.440 region:rollup2
LOWER INCOME AREA. AND TODAY A

01:08:28.338 --> 01:08:32.108 region:rollup2
NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF TRIPS

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.110 region:rollup2
DICKENS ALL BUT A HANDFUL.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.978 region:rollup2
ARE BEHIND PIECE IN TERMS OF

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:38.414 region:rollup2
DELIVERING ON THAT LOWER INCOME

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:39.782 region:rollup2
SEGMENT.

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.984 region:rollup2
MORE TROUBLING AS WELL AS THAT

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.151 region:rollup2
THE A WHERE WE ARE SEEING THAT

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:43.486 region:rollup2
HOUSING GETTING PRODUCED.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:45.121 region:rollup2
IS NOT.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:46.823 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY IT IS

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.057 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY OF FARTHER

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.592 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM JOBS IT IS FARTHER

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:51.427 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM AMENITIES IT IS

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:52.161 region:rollup2
FARTHER AWAY FROM TRANSIT. AND

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.962 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE PUTTING A FURTHER

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
BURDEN.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.365 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ARE BUILDING HOMES AND

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:57.300 region:rollup2
FOLKS TALKED BY THOSE HOUSES

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:57.867 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A CONTINUED

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.468 region:rollup2
DEPENDENCE ON CARS AND LONG

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.736 region:rollup2
COMMUTES.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.371 region:rollup2
A DIFFICULT ACCESS THE RESOURCES

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:03.506 region:rollup2
AMENITIES IN JOBS THEY NEED TO

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:05.508 region:rollup2
BE STABLE AND THE STATE HOUSE.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:07.110 region:rollup2
BOB THAT FACTOR HAS.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.112 region:rollup2
IS MUCH THE REASON WHY THE

01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:09.946 region:rollup2
UNITED CENSUS BUREAU LAST YEAR

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:12.081 region:rollup2
PLACE CALIFORNIA NUMBER ONE IN

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:13.349 region:rollup2
THE NATION. ARE FOR ITS POVERTY

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.517 region:rollup2
RATES ONCE COST OF LIVING IS

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:16.052 region:rollup2
FACTORED IN.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.919 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS MUCH OF THE REASON

01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:18.521 region:rollup2
WHY.

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:20.590 region:rollup2
TODAY CALIFORNIA ONE POINT

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:22.592 region:rollup2
SEVEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ON

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:25.128 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS HOUSEHOLDS.

01:09:22.592 --> 01:09:26.429 region:rollup2
ARE CAN BE ARE I HAVE WORST

01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:28.097 region:rollup2
CASE HOUSING NEEDS WHICH IS A

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:30.133 region:rollup2
HUD TERM THAT CAPTURES LOWER

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:31.634 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS NOT CURRENTLY

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:32.969 region:rollup2
RECEIVING ANY KIND OF RENTAL

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:34.537 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE OR SUPPORT. BETTER

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:36.139 region:rollup2
PAYING EVERY MONTH MORE THAN

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:38.241 region:rollup2
HALF OF THEIR INCOME.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:39.909 region:rollup2
IN HOUSING COSTS THIS A

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.377 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC IS ONE THAT WE NEED

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:42.078 region:rollup2
TO BE WHAT WORRYING AND WATCHING

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.312 region:rollup2
VERY CAREFULLY.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:45.181 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH OUT THERE

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:47.216 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE.

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.418 region:rollup2
BOB THIS THIS OF A BODY OF

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.786 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS ARE ONES WHO ARE

01:09:48.418 --> 01:09:51.587 region:rollup2
FALLING BEHIND ON TURN IT ON

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:53.189 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE NOT SAVING FOR THE

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:55.625 region:rollup2
KIDS' EDUCATION. UP AND HEART

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.460 region:rollup2
USES THIS NUMBER AS A PROXY FOR.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.961 region:rollup2
FOR HOMELESSNESS.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:09.138 region:rollup2
I'M HERE CALIFORNIA THAT NUMBER

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:09.706 region:rollup2
IS UP BY ALMOST A THIRD FROM

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.306 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WERE A DECADE AGO.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.907 region:rollup2
NOW PART OF THE STORY IS ALSO

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.574 region:rollup2
CLEARLY. ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.241 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY THAT HAS BEEN GOING OUT

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:12.842 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THIS POPULATION DIXIE

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:13.443 region:rollup2
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.110 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:14.644 region:rollup2
END UP IN A SIGNIFICANT PART OF

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.612 region:rollup2
THAT STORY.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:17.213 region:rollup2
DOES ALSO THAT TIE INTO THE

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.347 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE THE

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.982 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:22.518 region:rollup2
NOT OVER THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:24.554 region:rollup2
SEEN FEDERAL CUTS TO OUR QUIRK.

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:25.088 region:rollup2
A AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.656 region:rollup2
COMING INTO THE STATE OF

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:28.391 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:29.959 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2
THOSE CUTS HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.195 region:rollup2
IMPACTED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:34.130 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:36.232 region:rollup2
AS MANY MAY BE AWARE OF THE

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.934 region:rollup2
FEDERAL THAT REFORM FEATURE ONE

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.035 region:rollup2
THAT A CHANGE THE TAX CODE LAST

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:41.370 region:rollup2
DECEMBER.

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:42.739 region:rollup2
HAS HAD THE CONSEQUENCE OF

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.573 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE VALUE

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.608 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL LOW INCOME

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:46.242 region:rollup2
HOUSING TAX CREDIT.

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.610 region:rollup2
COR PART OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:50.012 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.580 region:rollup2
BUT SUCH THAT FROM TAX REFORM WE

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:52.482 region:rollup2
ARE NOW GONNA BE SEEING AN

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.584 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED. OF FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:56.552 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS OF LAST PER YEAR

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.887 region:rollup2
IN INVESTMENT. ARE GOING INTO

01:10:56.552 --> 01:11:00.990 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:03.192 region:rollup2
ANNUAL.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:04.193 region:rollup2
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.762 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S ALL WE DO KNOW

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:07.230 region:rollup2
WHAT WORKS I THINK THERE IS A

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:09.065 region:rollup2
VERY STRONG BODY OF LITERATURE

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:10.867 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AROUND HOMELESSNESS.

01:11:09.065 --> 01:11:12.201 region:rollup2
THAT GIVES US SOME SHOULD GIVE

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:13.836 region:rollup2
US SOME COURAGE AND HOPE.

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.938 region:rollup2
WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A NUMBER OF

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:17.106 region:rollup2
STATES SMALLER STATES ADMITTEDLY

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.074 region:rollup2
I'M AND CITIES AROUND THE

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.775 region:rollup2
COUNTRY WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.009 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HAVE THE MAYORS

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.244 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS GET OUT THERE DECLARE

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.345 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE ATTAINED. WHAT'S

01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:24.213 region:rollup2
CALLED FUNCTIONAL ZERO EITHER

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:25.848 region:rollup2
WITH A VETERAN HOMELESSNESS OR

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.849 region:rollup2
CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS.

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.317 region:rollup2
IN FACT RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:29.886 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HIT THAT MARKER.

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.921 region:rollup2
NOT THAT LONG AGO FOR FOR.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:33.856 region:rollup2
A CHRONIC VETERANS HOMELESS SO

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.791 region:rollup2
WE WE REDUCE THE PLACES THAT

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.392 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT THIS ALL

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.727 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AND THAT THE USE OF

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:39.395 region:rollup2
CIGARETTES THE BUTTE INGREDIENTS

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.264 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE. NO CLEARLY NUMBER

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:43.199 region:rollup2
ONE TACKLING THIS WORST CASE

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:44.667 region:rollup2
HOUSING YOU POPULATION WE CANNOT

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.902 region:rollup2
SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IF WE CAN'T

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.669 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE LARGER ISSUE.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:48.304 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:51.240 region:rollup2
A RENT BURDEN FOR LOWER INCOME

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:53.643 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.911 region:rollup2
BUT SECONDLY A INVESTING IN WHAT

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.679 region:rollup2
THE LITERATURE SHOWS ACTUALLY

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:58.648 region:rollup2
WORKS FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE A

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:59.215 region:rollup2
PRICKLY EPISODIC AND CHRONIC

AGAIN ANOTHER SET OF

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:09.171 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATIONS.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.072 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE IN THE

A WHAT CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:21.283 region:rollup2
MAY BE IN PLACE TO A GETTING

THIS FUNDING OUT THE DOOR A TO

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:24.687 region:rollup2
LOCAL ENTITIES AND THEN.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:26.889 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY A CONSTRUCTING THE

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:29.358 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN AND BRING IT ON LINE.

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:31.760 region:rollup2
ONE UNDERLYING CONSIDERATION IS

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:33.562 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THAT ONLY A SUBSET

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.731 region:rollup2
OF BUILDERS AND NON PROFITS

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:36.231 region:rollup2
I DO A SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:37.366 region:rollup2
BILLS PERMITS SUPPORTIVE

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:39.368 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:41.837 region:rollup2
AND STATE FUNDING IN PAST YEARS.

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:43.338 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT SPORADIC ó

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.307 region:rollup2
IT'S RELIED ON A ONE TIME

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:46.241 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS IN BOND FUNDS IN

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.676 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:49.778 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.313 region:rollup2
QUITE INCENTIVE FOR A ROBUST.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:53.649 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION OF NONPROFITS AND

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:55.050 region:rollup2
BUILDERS A SPECIALIZING IN THIS

01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:56.685 region:rollup2
TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:57.453 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF TAKE HOLD IN THE

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:59.388 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:20:57.453 --> 01:21:00.589 region:rollup2
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MANY

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:02.224 region:rollup2
OF THESE NONPROFITS ARE STARTING

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:03.425 region:rollup2
TO STAFF UP NOW AND AND RAMP UP

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:05.127 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:06.762 region:rollup2
RECENT ALLEGATIONS IN THIS AREA.

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:07.096 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF THAT WILL WILL TAKE

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:09.098 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:09.798 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS THAT IS ONE

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:10.799 region:rollup2
THING TO CONSIDER IS YOUR

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:12.868 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:14.636 region:rollup2
HOW QUICKLY THE CURRENT FUNDING

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:16.805 region:rollup2
IS MOVING OUT AND HOW QUICKLY

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:18.140 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAKE IT UP?

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:19.441 region:rollup2
A ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.110 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DOES

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:23.212 region:rollup2
REQUIRE A MORE SIGNIFICANT US

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:24.313 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES ON A PER UNIT BASIS

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:26.582 region:rollup2
THAN A TYPICAL AFFORDABLE

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:28.517 region:rollup2
HOUSING DOES. ON THIS IS THIS IS

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:30.819 region:rollup2
A GENERALLY DO THE THE SIMPLE

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:32.955 region:rollup2
FACT THAT A HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:34.857 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY CAN PAY A LITTLE

01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:36.925 region:rollup2
LITTLE OR NOTHING IN RENTS EVEN

01:21:34.857 --> 01:21:38.594 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO. THE GENERAL LOW

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:40.295 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:42.030 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN A GENERAL AFFORDABLE

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:44.066 region:rollup2
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:45.567 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT A LOW INCOME

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:47.770 region:rollup2
HOUSING TAX CUT TRADED PROJECT

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:49.972 region:rollup2
DATA FROM THE LAST FEW YEARS.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:51.874 region:rollup2
SHOWS OF THAT THAT THE TYPICAL

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:52.641 region:rollup2
STATE SUBSIDY NEEDED FOR A

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:55.043 region:rollup2
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:57.146 region:rollup2

JUST GENERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:59.248 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.183 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.984 region:rollup2
THIS NEED FOR GREATER SUBSIDY

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:03.152 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:05.120 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS TO

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:06.021 region:rollup2
PENCIL OUT IN THAT CAN CONSTRAIN

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.357 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:09.091 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FOR. A DEVELOPERS TO

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:12.227 region:rollup2
BRING THESE KIND OF PROJECTS

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:13.028 region:rollup2
FORWARD AS COMPARED TO A JUST A

DEVELOPMENT.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.100 region:rollup2
CITING A.

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:19.501 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.436 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:22.838 region:rollup2
A CONTINUES A TO BE SOMEWHAT OF

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.338 region:rollup2
A CHALLENGE AND IT AND IT DOES

01:22:22.838 --> 01:22:24.306 region:rollup2
TAKE TIME.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.542 region:rollup2
WE.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:28.310 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS.

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:30.512 region:rollup2
MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:32.147 region:rollup2
THIS AREA WITH A LEGISLATION

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.981 region:rollup2
LAST FOR YEARS TO ATTEMPT A TO

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.917 region:rollup2
STREAMLINE THESE LOCAL

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:35.851 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:37.186 region:rollup2
OF TIME IT TAKES TO THESE

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.921 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:40.222 region:rollup2
BUT THE BUT THERE'D STILL

01:22:38.921 --> 01:22:41.523 region:rollup2
REMAIN SOME REALITIES THAT THAT

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:43.225 region:rollup2
CREATE BARRIERS.

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:46.328 region:rollup2
AND CREATE TIME AT THE LOCAL

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:47.696 region:rollup2
LEVEL ONE KEY FACTOR IS A LANE

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:49.631 region:rollup2
LAND AVAILABILITY.

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:50.966 region:rollup2
OF MUCH OF THE HOMELESS PROBLEM

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:53.035 region:rollup2
IS CONCENTRATED OUR IN OUR

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:56.038 region:rollup2
DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREAS

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:56.538 region:rollup2
WHERE OF VACANT AND UNDER

01:22:56.038 --> 01:22:57.806 region:rollup2
UTILIZED LAND IS

01:22:56.538 --> 01:23:00.175 region:rollup2
VERY SCARCE.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.743 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPERS OF SPERM PERMITS

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:03.679 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ARE COMPETING

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:04.847 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:07.149 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS WITH COMMERCIAL

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:09.184 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS WITH ALL ALL A HOST

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:10.752 region:rollup2
OF OTHER KINDS OF A POTENTIAL

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:12.454 region:rollup2
USES FOR THAT SCARE SLOWING AND.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:13.322 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN CONSTRAIN THE

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:15.057 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.725 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTS TO COME

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:23.131 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN A GIVEN YEAR.

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:23.665 region:rollup2
I'M POUNDED A BY A LOCAL ZONING

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.567 region:rollup2
RULES.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:28.370 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.704 region:rollup2
CAN. ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.705 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH.

01:23:28.704 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
.

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:33.275 region:rollup2
WITH THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.277 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:36.445 region:rollup2
WE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAT TWO

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:38.580 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF MULTI FAMILY

01:23:36.445 --> 01:23:40.382 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS AND LARGE CITIES

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.651 region:rollup2
AND LA IN THE BAY AREA.

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:44.553 region:rollup2
NEEDED ZONING CHANGES TO MOVE

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:46.955 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN RECENT YEARS.

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:47.122 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.124 region:rollup2
HAS.

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.325 region:rollup2
.

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.426 region:rollup2
BEFORE HIS A PASS SOME

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:52.561 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.630 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM.

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.964 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S MADE SOME SOME

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:58.267 region:rollup2
BIG STEPS THERE OF BUT THIS IS

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:59.701 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN A

01:23:58.267 --> 01:24:01.003 region:rollup2
SOMETHING OF AN ISSUE FOR THE

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:02.704 region:rollup2
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

01:24:01.003 --> 01:24:04.473 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONSIDERATION.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:05.874 region:rollup2
THAT HASN'T BEEN AN ISSUE TODAY

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:07.442 region:rollup2
BUT THAT COULD BECOME AN ISSUE

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.378 region:rollup2
IN FUTURE YEARS. IS THE

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:10.646 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.813 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS THROUGH THE LOW

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.548 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:14.650 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AS DIRECTOR MET CALF

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:16.118 region:rollup2
MENTION.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.286 region:rollup2
THE LONG COMMITTING TAX CREDIT

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:19.421 region:rollup2
IS KIND OF THE FOUNDATION OF

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:20.789 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.556 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS.

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:23.358 region:rollup2
A AND THIS THIS PROGRAM.

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:25.294 region:rollup2
HAS.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:26.261 region:rollup2
TWO PARTS THERE'S THE THE NINE

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:26.995 region:rollup2
PERCENT CREDIT WHICH PROVIDES

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.497 region:rollup2
DAY.

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:29.731 region:rollup2
MORE SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDY FOR

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:31.099 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT THERE'S

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.134 region:rollup2
THE FOUR PERCENT CREDIT.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:34.603 region:rollup2
WHICH PROVIDE THE LESSER

01:24:32.134 --> 01:24:36.572 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY BUT IS A PAIRED WITH TAX

01:24:34.603 --> 01:24:37.172 region:rollup2
EXEMPT FINANCING THAT'S PROVIDED

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.173 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE STATE TREASURER'S

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:40.575 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:42.144 region:rollup2
AND BOTH SIDES OF OF THIS

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:43.278 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BOTH THE NINE PERCENT

01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:45.514 region:rollup2
CREDIT. AND DETECTIVE GOT

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:47.149 region:rollup2
FINANCING OUR OUR.

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:48.984 region:rollup2
CAPT ANNUALLY BASED ON LIMITS A

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:50.619 region:rollup2
SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:52.988 region:rollup2
A RIGHT NOW THE NINEPERCENT

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:54.389 region:rollup2
CREDIT IS A IT IS COMPETITIVE

01:24:52.988 --> 01:24:56.391 region:rollup2
IT'S OVER SUBSCRIBED.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:59.061 region:rollup2
BUT ON THE FOUR PERCENT SIDE.

01:24:56.391 --> 01:25:00.295 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH OF FUNDING

01:24:59.061 --> 01:25:00.929 region:rollup2
TO GO AROUND FOR ALL THE

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:02.297 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.764 region:rollup2
IN RECENT.

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:04.766 region:rollup2
BUT OTHER THERE IS THE

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:06.601 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.402 region:rollup2
IN THE COMING YEARS.

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.904 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:11.606 region:rollup2
IF NO PLACE LIKE HOME IN S. B.

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:12.975 region:rollup2
THREE DO COME ONLINE ASSUME. AND

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:14.977 region:rollup2
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE S. B.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:16.478 region:rollup2
TO FUNDING IN SOME OF THE LOCAL

01:25:14.977 --> 01:25:18.880 region:rollup2
BOND MEASURES THAT HAVE PASSED.

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:20.215 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF THAT FUNDING COMING

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.218 region:rollup2
ONLINE AT ONCE.

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:25.053 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKELY OR POSSIBLE OR

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.054 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAT EVEN THE FOUR

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.356 region:rollup2
PERCENT SIDE OF THE LOW INCOME

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:29.291 region:rollup2
HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM COULD

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:31.026 region:rollup2
BECOME OVER SUBSCRIBED.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:32.461 region:rollup2
THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:34.262 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE ALL THE

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:36.031 region:rollup2
PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD. OF BUT

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:37.566 region:rollup2
IT COULD MEAN YOU HAVE TO SPREAD

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:39.735 region:rollup2
OUT THOSE TAX CREDITS.

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:42.104 region:rollup2
MORE THINLY ACROSS A LARGER

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:44.439 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PROJECTS WHICH WOULD

01:25:42.104 --> 01:25:46.241 region:rollup2
THEN REQUIRE AS ESSENTIALLY A

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:47.442 region:rollup2
STATE TO FILL IN THE ADDITIONAL

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.944 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY NEEDED FOR THOSE

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:51.279 region:rollup2
PROJECTS MAKING. THE KIND OF THE

01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:53.415 region:rollup2
STATE'S COST FOR EACH UNIT. A

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:55.317 region:rollup2
MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:56.585 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WITH THAT THAT'S THE

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:58.387 region:rollup2
KIND OF A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:59.021 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS THAT

01:25:58.387 --> 01:25:59.554 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:01.490 region:rollup2
TAKEN.

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:02.758 region:rollup2
TO ACCOUNT AND THINKING ABOUT

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:06.828 region:rollup2
HOMELESS FUNDING MOVING FORWARD

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:09.498 region:rollup2
AND HAVE IT ANSWERED QUESTIONS.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:11.166 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU.

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:12.868 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO YOUR EARLIER POINT

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:15.604 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:17.339 region:rollup2
FUNDS OUT THE DOOR. DID YOU ARM

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:18.473 region:rollup2
FIND ANY PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:20.342 region:rollup2
THAT WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AT

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:21.910 region:rollup2
MOVING.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:23.445 region:rollup2
MONEY FASTER NOW A DIRECT

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.880 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT ALEJO AND

01:26:23.445 --> 01:26:25.914 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR MATT CASH

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.481 region:rollup2
A OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO BE

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.150 region:rollup2
PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:29.918 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:31.253 region:rollup2
I WE DO HAVE A CRISIS AND WE DO

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:36.958 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET SHELTER UP AS SOON

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:38.794 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:41.129 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT.

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:42.464 region:rollup2
.

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:44.533 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF MOVING

01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:45.801 region:rollup2
MONEY OUT MORE QUICKLY ONE OF

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:47.736 region:rollup2
THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS.

01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:49.371 region:rollup2
IS.

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:51.440 region:rollup2
TRYING TO LEVERAGE.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.674 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROGRAMS IN EXISTING

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.508 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:55.777 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:57.546 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE THROUGH EACH CITY

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.980 region:rollup2
OR THROUGH.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:00.382 region:rollup2
THE THE STATE LONG COME HOUSING

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.050 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:03.785 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:06.588 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO NOT

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:08.290 region:rollup2
REQUIRE. EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:09.458 region:rollup2
PROCESS EASIER OR A REGULATORY

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:12.027 region:rollup2
PROCESSES

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:13.829 region:rollup2
FOR EACH CD TO START MOVING A

01:27:12.027 --> 01:27:15.230 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING OUT THE DOOR.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:17.632 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:19.334 region:rollup2
ANY CD OF THAT KIND OF WORK

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:20.969 region:rollup2
COURSE PROGRAM HAS BEEN THE

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:22.537 region:rollup2
MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM.

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:24.372 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:25.373 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW POTENTIALS TO KIND OF

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:26.875 region:rollup2
HAVE SET ASIDE FOR THE TIME

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:29.878 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS LIKE A SUPPORTIVE

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:30.946 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:32.180 region:rollup2
AND AND MAYBE THE DIRECTOR

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:35.217 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE.

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:36.785 region:rollup2
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

01:27:35.217 --> 01:27:37.419 region:rollup2
BUT NO I THINK I THINK IF YOU

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:39.187 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT I THINK FOR FROM

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.122 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE A BUILDING ON

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:41.723 region:rollup2
WHAT WORKS INTERVIEW THE PROGRAM

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:42.357 region:rollup2
SO BACK IN THE PAST IS

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:44.126 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY THE BEST WAY THAT

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:45.594 region:rollup2
WE CAN MOVE. DEFINING OUT THAT

01:27:44.126 --> 01:27:46.962 region:rollup2
SAID WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.929 region:rollup2

DO THAT WITH THE S. B. THREE OF

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:56.838 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AS WELL. HIT THE OTHER

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:58.340 region:rollup2
THING I JUST MENTION. IT IS

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.141 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SOMETIMES A TEMPTATION

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.575 region:rollup2

OF OF CARE. ABOUT BUT I THINK

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.692 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THAT WE

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:36.344 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT'S A MUCH MORE COST

01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:36.945 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND TO HUMANE OPTION

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:39.147 region:rollup2

THE REALITY ON THE STREETS.

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:35.604 region:rollup2

POLITICS ALSO BEEN VERY FACILITY

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:19.861 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT ABOUT CLEANER THAT WE

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.895 region:rollup2
CAN WE CAN DO MORE TO SUPPORT

01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:22.063 region:rollup2
BUNDY'S CUT BEST PRACTICE LOCAL

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.031 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.598 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE AN

01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:25.433 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT?

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:26.868 region:rollup2

VERSES THE NEED THAT'S OUT

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:33.842 region:rollup2
THERE IN THE INCREASING NEED.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.409 region:rollup2
HI I I CERTAINLY THINK WE ARE

01:33:33.842 --> 01:33:35.477 region:rollup2
NOT A POSITION WHERE WE CAN

01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:37.545 region:rollup2
EXPECT.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND.

01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:42.317 region:rollup2
SO EVEN AT THE LEVELS I

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.952 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

01:33:42.317 --> 01:33:46.387 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE A PULL BACK THAT

01:33:43.952 --> 01:33:48.223 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TRAGIC OF BUT. A EVEN

01:33:46.387 --> 01:33:50.325 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NO PULL BACK WE NEED

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:53.161 region:rollup2
MORE DOLLARS NOT FEWER. THERE'RE

01:33:50.325 --> 01:33:54.429 region:rollup2
IS SET MY UNDERSTANDING AND. ONE

01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:55.630 region:rollup2
OF THE DYNAMICS HERE NOT MY

01:33:54.429 --> 01:33:57.832 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING ONE OF THE

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:59.501 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS HERE IS. THAT.

01:33:57.832 --> 01:34:02.904 region:rollup2
I'LL BE

01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:04.739 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF THE

01:34:02.904 --> 01:34:07.308 region:rollup2
RENTAL MARKET SECTION EIGHT

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:08.810 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS ARE. TIED OF DIFFICULTY

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:11.446 region:rollup2
UTILIZED AND MANY OF THE MORE

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:13.381 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AREAS OF THE STATE AND

01:34:11.446 --> 01:34:15.383 region:rollup2
CLUED IN AREAS SET IN AND AROUND

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:17.151 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT WHERE. THERE HAS

01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:18.753 region:rollup2
BEEN A TRADITION OF A GOOD DEAL

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:20.255 region:rollup2
OF SECTION EIGHT HOUSING THERE

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:21.890 region:rollup2
ARE SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:24.425 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS I IF I UNDERSTAND THE

01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:25.293 region:rollup2
NUMBER. CORRECTLY IN LOS ANGELES

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:27.962 region:rollup2
COUNTY THAT THE FEDERAL

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:29.731 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS THREATENING TO

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:31.266 region:rollup2
REMOVE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN HIS

01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:34.736 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY

01:34:31.266 --> 01:34:35.970 region:rollup2
COULDN'T FIND. A AND A A LAMB

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:37.605 region:rollup2
WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:40.441 region:rollup2
VOUCHER BECAUSE THE VOUCHER

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:41.843 region:rollup2
AMOUNT IS LOWER THAN THE MARKET

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:43.111 region:rollup2
WILL PAY TO THAT LANDLORDS

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:44.646 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE

01:34:43.111 --> 01:34:47.482 region:rollup2
MARKET WILL PAY. SO THERE'S A

01:34:44.646 --> 01:34:49.951 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT THERE AND THE.

01:34:47.482 --> 01:34:52.120 region:rollup2
OUTRAGEOUS CONSEQUENCE OF THAT

01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:55.523 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE ARE SEEING VOUCHERS

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.591 region:rollup2
GO UNUSED. AND A GOVERNMENT THAT

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.158 region:rollup2
IS SAYING WELL YOU KNOW IF

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.927 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT USING THEM WHICH

01:34:57.158 --> 01:35:01.429 region:rollup2
SKINNER PULLED BACK THE THE

01:34:58.927 --> 01:35:02.030 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:03.665 region:rollup2
THEM AGAIN.

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:06.067 region:rollup2
I AM NOT A NOT A POSITIVE

01:35:03.665 --> 01:35:07.769 region:rollup2
OUTCOME AYE I THINK BECAUSE.

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:09.370 region:rollup2
I'VE AND I'M REPEATING MYSELF

01:35:07.769 --> 01:35:10.838 region:rollup2

SAYING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:14.242 region:rollup2
BUT THE. COST OF AFFORDABLE

HOUSING IS.

01:35:14.242 --> 01:35:18.146 region:rollup2
OF SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:20.215 region:rollup2

HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

CURRENTLY AND WHILE AFFORDABLE

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:36.998 region:rollup2
HOUSING COSTS MIGHT BE?

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:38.700 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT WE

THAT THE A AND THE COSTS ARE SO

01:37:06.521 --> 01:37:12.160 region:rollup2
HIGH THAT THE IDEA THAT WE ARE

01:39:38.206 --> 01:39:42.510 region:rollup2
WITH. BALLOONING HOUSING COSTS

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:44.078 region:rollup2
AND SO. NOTE ARE ACRE CHALLENGES

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:45.346 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TOWARD UPSTREAM

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:46.714 region:rollup2
HERE RIGHT WE TRY TO MAKE

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:48.115 region:rollup2
PROGRESS BUT THE TIDE IS GONE

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:48.683 region:rollup2
GOING AGAINST US IN MANY WAYS IN

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:50.551 region:rollup2
TERMS OF JUST THE GROWTH OF

01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:51.185 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:52.920 region:rollup2
WHAT I CALLED WORST CASE HOUSING

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:54.755 region:rollup2
IS POPULATION?

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.123 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GUY AT THE CHALLENGES

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:57.191 region:rollup2
IN WEALTHIEST TO WHAT TURNED THE

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:58.192 region:rollup2
ECONOMY OFF THAT WOULD THAT

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:59.527 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT A NUMBER HOW THAT

01:39:58.192 --> 01:40:02.230 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE WAY TO LOWER THE

01:39:59.527 --> 01:40:03.798 region:rollup2
HOUSING COSTS? ON OF THE WHICH

01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:04.765 region:rollup2
IS PRETTY YOUR UPS RIGHT MEMBERS

01:40:03.798 --> 01:40:07.768 region:rollup2
WERE STRUGGLING WITH.

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:08.369 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:10.071 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO THIS YOU KNOW WHAT

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:11.672 region:rollup2
WHAT'S?

01:40:10.071 --> 01:40:13.741 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU TAUGHT DO

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:14.375 region:rollup2
UP WE CAN WRITE THAT THAT I

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:16.477 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLES

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:18.913 region:rollup2
OF YOUR PRODUCT. A THINKING OF

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:19.914 region:rollup2
ON. YEAH I DID I DID ONE ASKED

01:40:18.913 --> 01:40:22.149 region:rollup2
PARTNER FINDS YOU IN GOOD

01:40:19.914 --> 01:40:22.850 region:rollup2
MENTION DIRECTOR COUPLE NUMBERS.

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:25.453 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:27.221 region:rollup2
IMAGE P. IN THE FIFTY MILLION

01:40:25.453 --> 01:40:29.190 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. G. THIRTY SIX

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:31.659 region:rollup2
MILLION. NOT AND NEITHER OF

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:32.460 region:rollup2
THOSE SHOW UP ON MY.

01:40:31.659 --> 01:40:34.996 region:rollup2
CHARGE WHICH I BELIEVE ARE THE

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:36.430 region:rollup2
CHARTS THAT MY STAFF AND.

01:40:34.996 --> 01:40:38.499 region:rollup2
FINANCE WORKED ON IS THERE A

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:39.634 region:rollup2
REASON WHY.

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:41.335 region:rollup2
MAY AND ECONOMIC DEPARTMENT OF

01:40:39.634 --> 01:40:43.237 region:rollup2
FINANCE THE CHART THAT YOU HAVE

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:43.738 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU REPRESENTS THE

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:46.307 region:rollup2
FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE

01:40:43.738 --> 01:40:47.675 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND SO FROM

01:40:46.307 --> 01:40:49.176 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF IOUS SHE FOR

01:40:47.675 --> 01:40:50.478 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE FUNDING THAT WAS

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:52.113 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED WAS NOT

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:53.414 region:rollup2
INCLUDED AGAIN TO AVOID DOUBLE

01:40:52.113 --> 01:40:56.317 region:rollup2
COUNTING.

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:57.084 region:rollup2
I'VE A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CHART.

01:40:56.317 --> 01:40:58.252 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH WAS ACTUALLY

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:59.253 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED IN THE TWENTY

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:00.788 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT.

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:03.190 region:rollup2
.

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:04.158 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BCP

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:07.061 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THE RESOURCES TO

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:08.629 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS.

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:10.831 region:rollup2
OKAY. SO THE MONEY WE

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:12.733 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED.

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:16.037 region:rollup2
I IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD BE

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:16.871 region:rollup2
IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET.

01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:18.506 region:rollup2
I'M THE THE FUNDING WOULD HAVE

01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:19.507 region:rollup2
RATED YOU AND THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:41:18.506 --> 01:41:20.708 region:rollup2
BUDGET ACT.

01:41:19.507 --> 01:41:22.410 region:rollup2
FOR THAT SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:23.744 region:rollup2
BUDGET CONGRESSIONALLY SO'S WE

01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:26.213 region:rollup2
SHOULD LOOK AT THE SIXTEEN

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:27.048 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN BUDGET AS WELL.

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:28.082 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SET ON THE FUNDING WAS

01:41:27.048 --> 01:41:29.417 region:rollup2
PROVIDED FOR THAT THIRTY FIVE

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:31.552 region:rollup2
MILLION YESTERDAY THAT'S THAT

01:41:29.417 --> 01:41:33.120 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REFLECTED THERE.

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:35.156 region:rollup2
SO IT'S LIKE AS PART PART OF OUR

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.756 region:rollup2
OUR OUR CHALLENGES AND LIKE I

01:41:35.156 --> 01:41:35.923 region:rollup2
CAN'T DIRECTED EVERYBODY WHICH

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:39.794 region:rollup2
IS.

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:41.295 region:rollup2
ON.

01:41:39.794 --> 01:41:43.597 region:rollup2
IS ARE YOU KNOW WE WERE WERE

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:44.131 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:46.033 region:rollup2
HOW TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:48.202 region:rollup2
MONITOR? WE KNOW THAT MONEY

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:49.604 region:rollup2
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:51.038 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:41:49.604 --> 01:41:53.007 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T EVEN SEEM TO QUITE FIT

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:54.175 region:rollup2
ROUTE.

01:41:53.007 --> 01:41:55.676 region:rollup2
WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING WHAT ITS

01:41:54.175 --> 01:41:56.510 region:rollup2
BEING SPENT ON? AND HOW MUCH

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:58.679 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:59.947 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.948 region:rollup2
SO IS THERE A WAY AT LEAST THAT

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.016 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:08.189 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED VERY.

01:42:02.016 --> 01:42:10.191 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:11.292 region:rollup2
ANYBODY CAN ANSWER.

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:12.994 region:rollup2
I GUESS I WOULD JUST ECHO THE

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.594 region:rollup2
SENTIMENTS THAT YOU EXPRESSED

01:42:12.994 --> 01:42:15.630 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS.

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:16.831 region:rollup2
ANY CHALLENGE TO QUANTIFY

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:18.666 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN ALL OF THE

01:42:16.831 --> 01:42:20.534 region:rollup2
ABOVE STRATEGY AND WE COME AT IT

01:42:18.666 --> 01:42:22.970 region:rollup2
FROM A DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:24.939 region:rollup2
SO. ON. THE STATE FIRST

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:26.307 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY ALL THE

01:42:24.939 --> 01:42:27.141 region:rollup2
FUNDING ACROSS VARIOUS

01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:28.642 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS.

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:29.910 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE LAST HANDFUL OF

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:31.278 region:rollup2
YEARS AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:33.047 region:rollup2
IT IS A CHALLENGE IN CONTINUING

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:33.881 region:rollup2
TO WORK AT THIS.

01:42:33.047 --> 01:42:34.982 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE NOTABLY WE

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:36.384 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESS WE CAN

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.918 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THE SOFA CUSHIONS

01:42:36.384 --> 01:42:39.520 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR THE NICHOLS THAT

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:40.521 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN HEAR HIM BUT BECAUSE

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.323 region:rollup2
OF THE. YOU KNOW THE URGENCY OF

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:43.524 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION SO SO MANY CASES

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:45.126 region:rollup2
WHAT THE NUMBERS THAT WERE

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:46.327 region:rollup2
TALKING TO HERE REFLECT FUNDS

01:42:45.126 --> 01:42:47.361 region:rollup2
WERE WE'VE GONE BACK TO PASS

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:48.929 region:rollup2
YOUR ALLOCATIONS AND ACTUALLY

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:50.431 region:rollup2
CLAWED BACK DOLLARS BECAUSE OF

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:51.332 region:rollup2
NON PERFORMANCE. OF EXTRA LIKE

01:42:50.431 --> 01:42:52.733 region:rollup2
THOSE MONIES ARE MORE

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:54.001 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY IN THERE. SOME CASES

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:55.436 region:rollup2
WE HAD DOLLARS OUT WITH THE

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:56.971 region:rollup2
LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT ARE NO

01:42:55.436 --> 01:42:58.406 region:rollup2
LONGER RELEVANT AND TRY TO

01:42:56.971 --> 01:43:00.207 region:rollup2
REPURPOSE THEM THROUGH THE SPORT

01:42:58.406 --> 01:43:01.642 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING. MUCH DIRECTORY AS

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:02.910 region:rollup2
WELL SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:04.245 region:rollup2
THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:05.846 region:rollup2
ABSENCE OF YOU AT THIS POINT

01:43:04.245 --> 01:43:07.348 region:rollup2
TIME NOT HAVING. YOU KNOW THE

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:10.518 region:rollup2
DEDICATED PERMITS SOURCE TO DRAW

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:13.954 region:rollup2
ON OR GET NOT HAVING BEEN ABOUT

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:15.122 region:rollup2
A NEW A NEW INFUSION BOND FUNDS.

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:17.158 region:rollup2
OKAY ARE I HEAR THAT.

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:18.893 region:rollup2
.

01:43:17.158 --> 01:43:20.294 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY THE MOST ACCEPTABLE

01:43:18.893 --> 01:43:21.929 region:rollup2
ANSWER IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:25.399 region:rollup2
ARMS.

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:27.501 region:rollup2
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN?

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:29.270 region:rollup2
ON.

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:32.406 region:rollup2
BUT POSSESS WHICH IS THIS THIS

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:34.642 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN CLEARLY. COMMUNICATED

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:35.743 region:rollup2
TO BE. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NOT

01:43:34.642 --> 01:43:37.912 region:rollup2
JUST IN MY CITY BUT I THINK IN

01:43:35.743 --> 01:43:39.880 region:rollup2
MOST.

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:41.482 region:rollup2
MOST CITIES ACROSS THE LEAST THE

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.684 region:rollup2
LARGE CITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

01:43:41.482 --> 01:43:46.053 region:rollup2
HARM.

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:48.055 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALL GETTING GAS

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.390 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE IS DOING. HOME

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:52.493 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS IS TRYING TO DO

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:53.160 region:rollup2
MORE IN THIS AREA BUT ITS HARD

01:43:52.493 --> 01:43:54.962 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:57.531 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DONE.

01:43:54.962 --> 01:44:01.669 region:rollup2
SO HARM.

01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:03.237 region:rollup2
HOW SOON CAN WE? GET A CLEARER

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:04.238 region:rollup2
PICTURE OR A MORE ACCURATE.

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:05.739 region:rollup2
PICTURE I UNDERSTAND AND

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:07.942 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE EFFORT OF. GOING

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:09.110 region:rollup2
BACK LOOKING AT OTHER PROGRAMS

01:44:07.942 --> 01:44:09.710 region:rollup2
GETTING MONEY RE PURPOSING I

01:44:09.110 --> 01:44:10.845 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S FABULOUS I THINK

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.414 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:44:10.845 --> 01:44:14.014 region:rollup2
CHAU INGENUITY BUT. HOME

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:17.284 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T HELP US THROUGH OUR

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:17.752 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:19.420 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T WANNA BE

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:21.088 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRATIC ABOUT A PLAY DO I

01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.689 region:rollup2
LEAST WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.491 region:rollup2
MONEY WE'RE SPENDING AND WHERE

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:25.760 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING.

01:44:23.491 --> 01:44:27.762 region:rollup2
SOUTH CENTRAL HAVE THAT.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.996 region:rollup2
IN A MOCHA FIGHTER.

01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:30.531 region:rollup2
AFTERNOON SIR DANIEL PRINTED

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.532 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE CAN

01:44:30.531 --> 01:44:32.933 region:rollup2
WORK WITH STAFF TO COME UP WITH

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:34.902 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION DEVELOP A

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:36.370 region:rollup2
TIMELINE KILLED IT MORE SPECIFIC

01:44:34.902 --> 01:44:40.074 region:rollup2
PSALM ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:40.074 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR.

01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:43.444 region:rollup2
HAD MENTIONED.

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:45.780 region:rollup2
AT THIS IS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE.

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:47.615 region:rollup2
BUT DAMN I'M. I'M CONFIDENT WE

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.583 region:rollup2
CAN DO IT I WOULD SAY. HOPEFULLY

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:50.384 region:rollup2
WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO DELEGATE

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:52.052 region:rollup2
RICH YET BECAUSE BECAUSE

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:53.587 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS. THESE TOOK FOUR

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:55.890 region:rollup2
WEEKS IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:57.391 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:44:55.890 --> 01:45:00.027 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT AN ENTIRE.

01:44:57.391 --> 01:45:01.662 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY YOU KNOW.

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:03.998 region:rollup2
STOCK PLEASE STOP SHOT I THINK

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:05.933 region:rollup2
IS CONCERNING.

01:45:03.998 --> 01:45:07.902 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND I THINK THAT ON.

01:45:05.933 --> 01:45:09.336 region:rollup2
I OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO

01:45:07.902 --> 01:45:11.639 region:rollup2
ADVOCATE FOR PROP MORE

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:13.841 region:rollup2
PREPARATIONS IF THERE IS

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:15.409 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR. IF THE

01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:16.744 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:19.013 region:rollup2
SPENDING HASN'T REALLY PROVEN TO

01:45:16.744 --> 01:45:20.014 region:rollup2
BE EFFECTIVE EITHER.

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:21.715 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT JUST

01:45:20.014 --> 01:45:23.484 region:rollup2
MORE MUCH JUST MORE MONEY IS

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:24.952 region:rollup2
ALWAYS DANCERS WAS WE OBVIOUSLY

01:45:23.484 --> 01:45:25.920 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:45:24.952 --> 01:45:27.021 region:rollup2
AS WERE DEPLOYING FUNDS THAT

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.588 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:28.889 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVENESS TO IT MISTER

01:45:27.588 --> 01:45:30.691 region:rollup2
BLUE.

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:32.393 region:rollup2
I.

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:34.295 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMBER OF FIFA OF

01:45:32.393 --> 01:45:37.731 region:rollup2
FOLKS AROUND THE STATE WHO HAVE

01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:40.234 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THAT WE. OF A ASK THE

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:41.569 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR TO CREATE A STATE OF

01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:43.337 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY OR DECLARE A STATE OF

01:45:41.569 --> 01:45:45.973 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY AROUND HOMELESSNESS

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:48.209 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS. AN

01:45:45.973 --> 01:45:49.944 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE ARE A GOOD IDEA

01:45:48.209 --> 01:45:51.946 region:rollup2
PUTTING PUTTING THAT ASIDE I

01:45:49.944 --> 01:45:54.582 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD BE TREATING THIS

01:45:51.946 --> 01:45:54.748 region:rollup2
ISSUE AS IF IT WERE AN EMERGENCY

01:45:54.582 --> 01:45:57.651 region:rollup2
SO.

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:59.420 region:rollup2
.

01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:00.688 region:rollup2
I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK

01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:02.022 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT THAT WAY I AM NOT

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.523 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THAT YOU DON'T SEE

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:03.424 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT AND THEY

01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:05.159 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T.

01:46:03.424 --> 01:46:06.927 region:rollup2
BEEN PUTTING EFFORT INTO IT BUT

01:46:05.159 --> 01:46:08.696 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT IF WE START TO

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:10.831 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT

01:46:08.696 --> 01:46:13.033 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY. BEYOND. THAT WILL

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:14.902 region:rollup2
BE HELPFUL I I WOULD POINT OUT

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:16.604 region:rollup2
THAT THE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE

01:46:14.902 --> 01:46:18.472 region:rollup2
CITY OF LOS ANGELES FFSA ARE

01:46:16.604 --> 01:46:19.673 region:rollup2
ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE AS AS THEY

01:46:18.472 --> 01:46:21.575 region:rollup2
ARE AND AND.

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:24.278 region:rollup2
MANY PLACES AROUND THE STATE

01:46:21.575 --> 01:46:27.882 region:rollup2
AND OF VOTER DAY OF.

01:46:24.278 --> 01:46:30.217 region:rollup2
A.

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:31.852 region:rollup2
TO GET THE AMOUNT OF DATA.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:32.887 region:rollup2
THE SALES TAX MEASURE THAT IS

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:34.455 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO.

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:35.689 region:rollup2
AT AND THAT WILL GENERATE

01:46:34.455 --> 01:46:37.992 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:40.361 region:rollup2
TO A BILL TEN THOUSAND UNITS

01:46:37.992 --> 01:46:42.396 region:rollup2
OVER TEN YEARS.

01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:44.231 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE GOAL OF.

01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:46.834 region:rollup2
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:49.103 region:rollup2
I'VE GOT THIS JUST AS WE SEE AT

01:46:46.834 --> 01:46:51.105 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL

01:46:49.103 --> 01:46:54.141 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THERE ARE BOTTLENECKS

01:46:51.105 --> 01:46:57.478 region:rollup2
IN OUR LOCAL EFFORTS AND THERE'S

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:59.947 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY. NO PLAN FOR ACTUALLY

01:46:57.478 --> 01:47:01.949 region:rollup2
STE A. OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE

01:46:59.947 --> 01:47:03.851 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE HOUSING PRODUCTION

01:47:01.949 --> 01:47:05.586 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING A OF FOR

01:47:03.851 --> 01:47:07.554 region:rollup2
HOMELESS PRODUCTION FROM WHERE

01:47:05.586 --> 01:47:10.257 region:rollup2
IT IS NOW TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:13.060 region:rollup2
BE TO GET TO A THOUSAND. UNITS A

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:15.095 region:rollup2

THOUSAND AND TEN YEARS.

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:20.434 region:rollup2
SO WE ALL AND THAT THE REASON I

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:22.169 region:rollup2
BRING THIS UP IS THAT WE ALL

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:23.637 region:rollup2
