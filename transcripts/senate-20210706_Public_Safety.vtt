THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.753
SENATOR SCANNER. NO QUESTIONS

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.290
OR CONCERNS FROM. MEMBERS YOUR

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:13.027
IN THIS COMMENT THAT TIME.

01:32:13.094 --> 01:32:14.862
WHILE THERE THE TESTIMONY WAS

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:18.900
THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS- THESE

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:21.269
FACTORS CAN ALREADY BE FACTORED.

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:23.037
I THINK WE HAVE LOTS OF

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:28.676
INDICATION. OF- I WILL FOCUS ON

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:30.945
WOMEN FOR THE MOMENT OF WOMEN

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.713
WHO ARE SERVING QUITE LONG

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:37.885
SENTENCES WHO- WERE THE VICTIMS

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:39.654
OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WHERE

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.721
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS A

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.823
FACTOR IN THE IN THE

01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:45.226
CIRCUMSTANCE OR AND OR THE

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.395
HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND YET IT

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:50.898
DID NOT AFFECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:55.069
SO WHETHER- AND IN MY-

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:57.104
UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE THERE

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:58.806
WAS NOT ENOUGH CLARITY IN THE

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:00.808
LAW THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.743
BILL DOES IS CREATE THAT TYE

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.412
OF CLARITY SO IT REALLY CAN BE

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:07.348
FACTORED IN I THINK THAT'S IN A

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.717
VERY VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.886
SENTENCING SO THAT IS WHY

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:14.221
SUPPORTABILITY THANK DR PER

01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:18.359

YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.764
ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS-

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.733
FROM THE OPPOSITION. HEY WE

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.602
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM-

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:30.504
AND HAVE TAKEN QUITE A FEW

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:32.039
AMENDMENTS TO NARROW DOWN THIS

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:35.209
BILL- SO. I WOULD LIKE THEM TO

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:38.879
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT SOME POINT-

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:41.349
THE SECOND THING IS. IF YOU

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:45.386
LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY- SO A

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.922
THIS IS NOT ABOUT A WOMAN WHO

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.257
STEALS A GALLON OF MILK. YOU

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.526
KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.128
CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED THIS

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:56.030
IS NOT ABOUT EXEMPTING AND

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:56.797
CONDONING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:58.966
EITHER BUT IT IS ABOUT ALLOWING

01:33:59.033 --> 01:34:00.267
THE COURTS TO TAKE INTO

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.770
CONSIDERATION THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.905
OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND TRAUMA THAT

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:07.308
LED TO THAT PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:09.210
THIS IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:12.079
FREE CARD- BUT IT ISN'T ONCE

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:14.015
AGAIN ABOUT. SOMEONE IT'S NOT

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.783
JUST ABOUT EXEMPTING ALL KINDS

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.918
OF YOU KNOW CRIMINAL OR FELONY

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.653
OR VIOLENT CRIMES TO FOCUS ON

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.622
THESE NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:24.892
CRIMES THAT DON'T. THE REALITY

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.395
IS THAT MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:28.729
ARE OR WHO HAVE BEEN

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.765
INCARCERATED. HAVE STORIES THAT

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.466
INVOLVE SEXUAL ABUSE OF THEIR

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.135
BODIES AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:36.070
THE COURTS DO NOT SEE THAT

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:37.805
BECAUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED. YOU

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:40.608
KNOW BY A PATRIARCHY. KIANA

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:42.943
STORY APRIL STORY INVOLVES

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:45.713
SITUATIONS WHERE MEN. IN

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.848
MULTIPLE TIMES PURCHASED AND

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:50.017
SOLD AND TRAUMATIZED THESE

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:51.919
WOMEN AND THOSE FOLKS WERE NOT

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:53.421
GIVEN ANY KIND OF SERIOUS

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.489
PUNISHMENT. AND WE KNOW THAT

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:57.024
COURTS LOOK VERY DIFFERENTLY AT

01:34:57.091 --> 01:35:00.995
WOMEN. WHO TAKE. HOLD OF THEIR

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.963
BODIES AND THEIR FREEDOM. I'M

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.866
VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN AND

01:35:05.933 --> 01:35:08.636
SO THIS WORKS TO ADDRESS THIS I

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:09.804
WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO ADD

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:10.938
THAT THE VERY NARROW

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:12.173
PRESCRIPTIONS AT THE OPPOSITION

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.075
CONTINUES TO ASK FOR ACTUALLY

01:35:14.141 --> 01:35:18.079
CREATE. INFLEXIBILITY WITH IN

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:19.747
THE COURT SYSTEM AND TIE THE

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:22.183
HANDS OF JUDGES AND WE KNOW

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:25.719
THAT. JUDGES DON'T WRESTLE

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.888
OFTEN TIMES WITH THESE KINDS OF

01:35:27.955 --> 01:35:29.523
ISSUES THEY ERR ON THE SIDE OF

01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:32.226
THE CONSERVATIVE RULING- AND SO

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.928
THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW FOR

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:35.596
DISCRETION AND FOR FLEXIBILITY

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:36.897
IN THE COURT SO THAT JUDGES ARE

01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:38.699
ABLE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:40.668
CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT ARE PART OF

01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:41.969
A PARTICULAR CHARGE WHEN

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:43.804
THEY'RE MAKING A SENTENCING-

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:46.507
RULING. THAT THE DEFENSE COULD

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:47.942
WE STILL HAVE TO DISPROVE THESE

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.910
THINGS SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.745
HAVING FOLKS COME OUT. WITH

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:54.281
THESE RANDOM ACTS OF LOVE WILD

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.317
VIOLENCE AND YOU HAVE TO LET

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:57.952
THEM OUT BECAUSE OF THESE BILLS

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.120
THINGS STILL HAVE TO BE PROVEN

01:35:59.186 --> 01:36:00.521
AND THEY HAVE TO BE DISPROVEN

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.823

GANGS ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND AT

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:52.753
THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL IS

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.923
JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT

ORDINAY CRIMES. ARE TURNED

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:23.450
INTO GANG CRIMES BECAUSE OF OUR

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.986
FEAR OF GANGS AND THE STEREO

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:29.423

TODAY. IN MY INDIVIDUAL

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:03.363
CAPACITY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.197
THREE THREE THE STEP FORWARD

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:06.667
ACT. AB THREE THIRTY THREE IS A

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:08.301
MODEST BILL THAT WOULD MITIGATE

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.437
SOME OF THE IMBALANCES BETWEEN

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:12.773
PROSECUTORS. AND PEOPLE ACCUSED

01:45:12.839 --> 01:45:14.875
UNDER THE ANTI GANG. LAW WE

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:16.877
KNOW IS THE STEP BACK. WHEN IT

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.278
WAS PASSED OVER THIRTY YEARS

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.247
AGO THE STEP UP PROPONENTS OF

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.448
THE STEP ACT PRESSURED

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:22.783
CALIFORNIANS THAT IT WOULD BE

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.751
USED IN ONLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:27.688
CASES. BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:29.489
IN FACT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:31.591
THE USE OF GANG HANDS MRS

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.493
INCREASED OVER FORTY PERCENT.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.831
WHAT CRIMES OF ALL TYPES HAVE

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:38.965
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:40.634
IS TRUE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.402
OF LEGISLATIVE ADVANCEMENTS AND

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:43.904
JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE

01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:45.872
STEP ACT THAT HAS GREATLY

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:48.442
ENHANCED ITS REACH. ORIGINALLY

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:50.010
PROPONENTS JUSTIFIED THE

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.912
INCREASE IN PUNISHMENT FOR

01:45:51.978 --> 01:45:53.513
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.248
STREET GANGS. BASED ON TWO

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:57.551
FACTORS FIRST THE ORGANIZED

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.720
NATURE CRIMINAL STREET GANGS

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.154
AND SECOND THE PATTERN OF

01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:02.789
VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:05.392
THEY ENGAGED IN. BUT NOW ALMOST

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.661
ANY CRIME CAN BE DESIGNATED I'M

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:08.929
SORRY ANY GROUP CAN BE

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:10.530
DESIGNATED AS A CRIMINAL STREET

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:13.133
GANG AS LONG AS A POLICE

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.069
OFFICER SAYS SO. AB THREE THREE

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:16.570
THREE WOULD TIGHTEN THE

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:17.971
REQUIREMENTS IN ESTABLISHING A

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.239
CRIMINAL STREET GANG IN

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:21.975
IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST IT WOULD

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.944
REMOVE EIGHT ACTUALLY IF WE

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.712
TAKE A BERKELEY SEVEN. A

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:28.048
NONVIOLENT PROPERTY CRIMES FROM

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.382
A LIST OF THIRTY THREE

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:32.119
PREDICATE OFFENSES THAT- THAT

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.287
ARE USED TO PROVE UP PATTERN OF

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.389
GANG ACTIVITY. SECOND IT WOULD

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:38.158
NOT ALLOW THE CURRENT- CHARGED

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:40.794
OFFENSE TO BE A QUALIFY AS ONE

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.629
OF THE PREDICATE ACTIVITIES

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:45.165
FENCES. AND THIRTY WOULD ENSURE

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:47.601
THAT ONE OF THE PREDICATE ONE

01:46:47.667 --> 01:46:49.603
OF THE- PREDICATE OFFENSES

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:51.838
OCCURS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:53.406
THE CHARGED OFFENSE. MOST

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:54.407
SIGNIFICANTLY IT WOULD

01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:56.209
BIFURCATE THE PROOF OF THE GANG

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:58.745
ENHANCEMENTS. RESEARCH SHOWS

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:00.380
THAT MERELY PRESENTING GANG

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:01.982
EVIDENCE CAN MOVE JURORS TO

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:04.184
CONVICT EVEN IF GUILTY BEYOND

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:05.786
REASONABLE DOUBT HAS NOT BEEN

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:06.566
INCARCERATE THE MOST VIOLENT

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:08.334
OFFENDERS AND THAT INCLUDES

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:11.337
GANG MEMBERS. THE PROPOSED

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:13.139
AMENDMENTS ARE COMMONSENSE

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:14.140
FIRST WE'RE ASKING YOU TO

01:55:14.207 --> 01:55:17.744
DELETE THE MODIFIER ORGANIZED

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:18.244
FROM THE DEFINITION OF A

01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:19.846
CRIMINAL STREET GANG. THE

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.247
CURRENT DEFINITION AND I

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:23.316
UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS TECHNICAL

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:24.784
IT IS PRECISE AND IT'S PROBABLY

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:26.519
ONLY SOMETHING THAT A LAWYER

01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:28.187
WOULD APPRECIATE BUT WHAT I

01:55:28.254 --> 01:55:29.956
WOULD SUBMIT TO THIS COMMITTEE

01:55:30.023 --> 01:55:32.292
IS THAT THE PEOPLE MUST PROVE

01:55:32.358 --> 01:55:34.494
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.097
A GAME IS A ORGANIZATION GROUP

01:55:38.164 --> 01:55:40.166
OR ASSOCIATION WITH THREE OR

01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:41.768
MORE MEMBERS WITH A COMMON SIGN

01:55:41.834 --> 01:55:44.337
OR SYMBOL WHO HAVE AS THEIR

01:55:44.404 --> 01:55:46.272
PRIMARY ACTIVITIES. FOR LOANING

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:48.508
US CONDUCT THESE FELONIES

01:55:48.574 --> 01:55:50.643
INCLUDING MURDER ROBBERY

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:54.347
KIDNAPPING EXTORTION VIOLENT.

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:56.115
THAT ARE COMMITTED. I MERRILY

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:59.819
WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES.

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:03.189
ORGANIZED CHANGES THAT STANDARD

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:04.991
BECAUSE GANGS ARE NOT ALWAYS

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:06.959
ORGANIZED THEY MAY EVEN MAKE

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.061
KIND OF QUALIFY AS AN

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:09.929
ORGANIZATION ASSOCIATION OR

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:13.299
GROUP BUT TO REQUIRE THIS HIRE-

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.134
HURDLE FOR THE PROSECUTOR TO BE

01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:16.336
ABLE TO PROVE THAT THE GANG

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.237
ITSELF IS ORGANIZED SIMPLY IS

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:21.774
NOT REFLECTED IN THE REALITY OF

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:22.275
HOW GAINES CONDUCT THEIR

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:24.277
BUSINESS. IF YOU DELETE THAT

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.346
TERM THEN WE CAN TURN TO THE

01:56:26.412 --> 01:56:28.448
SECOND A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.683
DELETE. THIS REQUIREMENT THAT

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:32.285
THE COMMON BENEFIT OF A

01:56:32.352 --> 01:56:34.487
PREDICATE OFFENCE BE MORE THAN

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.823
REPUTATIONAL. IF THE IF THAT

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:39.092
LANGUAGE IS DELETED THEN OUR

01:56:39.158 --> 01:56:41.661
OPPOSITION CAN SHIFT TO NEUTRAL

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.663
AND WE WENT COLD WE WOULD IN

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:46.132
KOREA IN COURAGE. OR LAW

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:47.266
ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO DO THE

01:56:47.333 --> 01:56:49.369
SAME THE REASON WHY WE

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:51.671
SUGGESTING THIRD THAT THIS MORE

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:53.106
THAN REPUTATIONAL BENEFIT

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:55.141
LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE DELETED IS

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:57.677
BECAUSE- INCREASING A GANG'S

01:56:57.744 --> 01:57:00.046
REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE IS THE

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:02.348
PRIMARY MOTIVATION OF MOST GANG

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.584
CRIME. THE AUTHOR HAS USED THE

01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.185
EXAMPLE OF AN ELDERLY

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:07.653
INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY BE JAY

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.123
WALKING AND GETTING ENHANCEMENT

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.891
IS GOING TO BE OUT LATE AGAINST.

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.659
BUT THERE SIMPLY IS NOT BASED

01:57:13.726 --> 01:57:15.928
IN REALITY. REALISTICALLY THE

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:17.597
VAST MAJORITY OF GANG

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:19.232
ENHANCEMENTS ARE LEVIED AGAINST

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:22.602
VIOLENT CRIMINALS INDIVIDUALS

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:23.870
WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CURRENT

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:26.639
OFFENSE INVOLVING VIOLENCE. END

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:29.075
THEIR MEMBERSHIP REFLECTS A

01:57:29.142 --> 01:57:31.978

FOLKS. AND THEN THE NATURE OF

02:06:05.724 --> 02:06:09.028
THE VIOLENT CRIMES. AND I THINK

02:06:09.094 --> 02:06:10.829
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:13.832
THAT WE THIS DOES NOT IMPACT AT

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:16.068
ALL THE BASIC SENSE OF THE

VIOLENCE AGAINST ON THE VIOLENT

02:06:17.002 --> 02:06:19.438
CRIMES AND IT STILL ALLOWS THE

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:21.206
PERSON TO BE CONVICTED OF A

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.908
VIOLENT CRIME THAT THEY MAY

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:28.047

02:06:28.113 --> 02:06:29.448

THE HIGHEST SENTENCE FOR

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:34.553

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.856
JUST IF WE IN EVEN ELIMINATING

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.291
OUR ENHANCEMENTS THINKING

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:42.094
HANSON'S INSECT RB SENSES ARE

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:44.396
ALREADY LONGER THAN MOST OTHER

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:47.266

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:51.136
A- FIVE IF WE COMPARE OURSELVES

02:06:51.203 --> 02:06:54.106
EVEN THE TEXAS RB SENSES ARE

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:56.875
LONGER IN MOST CASES IN MOST OF

02:06:56.942 --> 02:06:58.344
OUR CRIME CATEGORIES AS BAY

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.946

THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL ARE YOU

CHARACTERIZED AS SOFT ON CRIME.

02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:13.492
SO I SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING AS

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:17.262
TRYING TO CORRECT. A IS NOT TO

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:19.264
TRY TO ELIMINATE. THE

CONSEQUENCE FOR SOMEONE WHO

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.168
ENGAGES IN A VIOLENT ACT BUT

02:07:23.235 --> 02:07:25.771
RATHER TRYING TO ELIMINATE

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:28.007
THOSE THINGS THAT ARE. AND THIS

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:29.241

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.310
PROBLEMS WITH OUR SENTENCING

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.946
SCHEMES AND NOT TRYING TO

02:17:30.108 --> 02:17:31.943
FOR THE VICTIMS. CURRENTLY IN

THAT DOG THEY ARE MORE

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.083
PROTECTED THAN THESE WOMEN. AND

02:17:38.149 --> 02:17:39.651
SO WHAT I AM ASKING YOU TO DO

02:17:39.718 --> 02:17:40.785
IS HARD I'M ASKING YOU DO SOME

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.654
THINGS THIS COMMITTEE RARELY IF

EVER DOES. WHICH IS ENHANCE THE

02:17:45.523 --> 02:17:47.792
PENALTIES ON THESE CRIMES. BUT

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:49.227
I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IT BECAUSE

02:17:49.294 --> 02:17:51.262
WE HAVE WOMEN THAT ARE BEING

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:53.031
DENIED THE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:17:53.098 --> 02:17:55.567
RIGHT. TO WALK INTO THESE

02:17:55.634 --> 02:17:57.135
CLINICS AND GET THE HEALTH CARE

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.870
THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.639
BECAUSE THEY TURN AWAY BECAUSE

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:03.108
THEY'RE AFRAID AND IT IS OUR

02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:05.644
JOB TO PROTECT THEM WE ARE A

02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:07.846
STATE THAT STANDS AND SAYS WE

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:09.314
WILL ALWAYS PROTECT A WOMAN'S

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:11.149
RIGHT TO CHOOSE. BUT THAT

02:18:11.216 --> 02:18:12.817
DOESN'T JUST MEAN THAT WOMEN

02:18:12.884 --> 02:18:13.718
HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT TO AN

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.954
ABORTION IT MEANS ENSURING

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.055
THEIR SAFETY SECURITY AND

02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:19.090
DIGNITY WHEN THEY WALK IN TO

02:18:19.157 --> 02:18:20.392
SEE THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:21.292
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:23.528
DOES. ANY DOES IT IN A NUMBER

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:25.196
OF WAYS IT ENSURES THAT OUR

02:18:25.263 --> 02:18:28.133
POLICE ARE TRAINED IT ENSURES

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:29.768
THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS THERE TO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.469
ENFORCE TO ENSURE THAT THESE

02:18:31.536 --> 02:18:34.305
WOMEN ARE NOT VICTIMIZED WHEN

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:36.608
SEEKING THEIR HEALTHCARE. AND

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:38.076
THE PROBLEM IS ONLY GETTING

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.678
WORSE AND SO I KNOW I'M ASKING

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:40.612
THIS COMMITTEE DO SOMETHING

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:42.213
HARD TODAY. BUT I THINK IT IS

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.882
SO CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE

02:18:43.948 --> 02:18:45.917

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:52.991
HERE ASKING FOR THIS. AND WITH

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:55.060
THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.896

02:18:57.962 --> 02:18:59.397

YOU- YEAH RESEARCHER I MEAN IT.

OUR PREFERENCE THAT WE MOVE

02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:51.949
FORWARD WITH. WYLER'S BUT IF

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:52.849
THE CHAIRS ARE QUESTIONABLE

02:39:52.916 --> 02:39:57.287
THEM NOT AGREE TO THE. SINNERS

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:59.923
CAN. ARM I NOTICED THAT THERE

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:02.960
IS A SUNSET IF THE BOTTLERS ARE

02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:05.362
REMOVED DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:08.732
TO HAVE THE SUNSET. MY

02:40:08.799 --> 02:40:09.933
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS PUT

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.435
IN BY SOMEBODY PUBLIC SAFETY SO

02:40:11.501 --> 02:40:12.836
WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH

02:40:12.903 --> 02:40:13.937
THEM IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE

02:40:14.004 --> 02:40:16.373
WITH THAT COMING OUT FINE FOR

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:19.176
ME MAY. I IF I MEAN AND THAT

02:40:19.242 --> 02:40:21.144
IT'S UP TO YOU BUT THAT DOESN'T

02:40:21.211 --> 02:40:22.446
YEAH SO WHAT WE HAD DONE WAS

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:23.947
PART OF THE QUESTION WHICH I

02:40:24.014 --> 02:40:24.982
THINK IS A QUESTION POSED BY.

02:40:25.048 --> 02:40:26.049
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

02:40:26.116 --> 02:40:27.017
COMMITTEE I SAID ON THE OTHER

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:29.086
SIDE AS WELL AS DOES THIS WORK

02:40:29.152 --> 02:40:29.920
RIGHT IS RAISING CRIMES

02:40:29.987 --> 02:40:31.888
ACTUALLY DETER. AND IN MOST

02:40:31.955 --> 02:40:33.457
CASES THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY NO

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:34.891
BUT THIS IS SUCH A NARROWLY

02:40:34.958 --> 02:40:37.060
FOCUSED BILL. FOCUSED ON A

02:40:37.127 --> 02:40:38.128
GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WE

02:40:38.195 --> 02:40:39.529
KNOW WE ONLY HAVE ESCALATING

02:40:39.596 --> 02:40:40.530
PROBLEMS ITH THAT WHAT WE HAD

02:40:40.597 --> 02:40:42.032
AGREED TO WAS FOR THE WHILE

02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:43.600
OTHERS REMAIN IN FOR THREE

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:44.568
YEARS TO REPORT BACK TO THE

02:40:44.634 --> 02:40:46.703
LEGISLATURE. AND THEN HOPEFULLY

02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:47.637
I'LL STILL BE HERE BUT MANY OF

02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:50.007
US HERE THREE YEARS OVER BACK

02:40:50.073 --> 02:40:51.141
TO PUBLIC SAFETY ACTUALLY TAKE

02:40:51.208 --> 02:40:52.876
A LOOK AND SEE DID THIS ACHIEVE

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:53.977
THE GOAL WHICH WAS TO ALLOW THE

02:40:54.044 --> 02:40:56.480
RIGHT TO. SAFE ACCESS TO

02:40:56.546 --> 02:40:57.748
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BUT

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.983
THE BEST SUNSET THE QUESTION WE

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:01.051
WERE ASKING WAS WHETHER THE LAW

02:41:01.118 --> 02:41:02.619
BLURS WORKED SUNSET ONLY

02:41:02.686 --> 02:41:06.189
RELATES TO THE WATER SO I DON'T

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:06.757
EVEN THINK I WOULD HAVE ANY

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:09.026
EFFECT TO BE HONEST. WELL IF.

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:10.260
ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY'S

02:41:10.327 --> 02:41:12.295
CONTROL. GIVEN THAT THE AUTHOR

02:41:12.362 --> 02:41:14.498
IS ACCEPTED THE REMOVAL OF THE

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:17.200
BOTTLERS AND- IF THEY DIDN'T

02:41:17.267 --> 02:41:18.769
HAVE OBJECTION SEEMS TO ME WE

02:41:18.835 --> 02:41:22.039
SHOULD LOOK AT THE SUNSET. WELL

02:41:22.105 --> 02:41:24.174
I'M NOT IN POSITION TO OVERDO

02:41:24.241 --> 02:41:25.609
IT PUBLIC SAFETY AS JOHN

02:41:25.675 --> 02:41:28.278
PURCELL I'M JUST GONNA RESPECT

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:30.280
THAT PROCESS IN. AND DEAL WITH

02:41:30.347 --> 02:41:31.882
THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEFORE

02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:33.817
US RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S AGAIN

02:41:33.884 --> 02:41:35.318
REMOVING THE FELONIES AND- WELL

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.921
I SUPPOSE ONE POSSIBLE BENEFIT

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:40.290
OF. LEAVING THE SUNSET IS THAT

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:43.493
THIS DOES NOT DETER DEFENDERS

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:45.462
THREE YEARS IT SHOWS THAT THE

02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:49.132
MISDEMEANOR IS NOT ADEQUATE. TO

02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:51.601
STOP REPEAT OFFENDERS THEN OF

02:41:51.668 --> 02:41:53.737
COURSE THEN WE COULD ENTERTAIN.

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:55.005
THE LEVELLERS AGAIN BECAUSE

02:41:55.072 --> 02:41:57.074
THAT WOULD BE AN INDICATION OF

02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:58.975
THAT THE MISDEMEANORS WERE NOT

02:41:59.042 --> 02:42:01.478
ADEQUATE TO DO SO. AND I

02:42:01.545 --> 02:42:03.413
APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THE

02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:05.849
MOTIVATION OF THE BILL I ALSO

02:42:05.916 --> 02:42:06.650
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO

02:42:06.716 --> 02:42:09.119
TAKE THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THE

02:42:09.186 --> 02:42:12.255
DIFFICULTY I THINK A LOT OF A

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:15.592
SPACES THAT. I FOR EXAMPLE HI

02:42:15.659 --> 02:42:17.961
KERRY BILLS AT TIMES TO TRY TO

02:42:18.028 --> 02:42:19.863
CORRECT WERE I THINK WE ARE

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:23.266
OVER- CHARGING AND I TRIED TO

02:42:23.333 --> 02:42:24.568
BRING IT BACK TO MISDEMEANOR

02:42:24.634 --> 02:42:26.870
BECAUSE IN MANY OF THE CASES AT

02:42:26.937 --> 02:42:28.238
LEAST IN MY BILLS THOSE

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:30.073
SENTENCES CAN BEUP TO YEAR IN

02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:31.775
COUNTY JAIL AND A YEAR AND

02:42:31.842 --> 02:42:33.043
COUNTY JAIL IS QUITE

02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:34.678
SIGNIFICANT FOR ANY OF US I

02:42:34.744 --> 02:42:35.946
MEAN OUR LIVES ARE GREATLY

02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:37.914
ALTERED IF WE ARE IN COUNTY

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:40.083
JAIL EVEN SIX MONTHS. WHEN WE

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:42.652
LOSE OUR JOBS MOST LIKELY WE

02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:44.721
KNOW THERE'S MANY MANY FACTORS

02:42:44.788 --> 02:42:45.789
AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THAT

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:50.127
RECORD SO I FOR ONE AM NOT

02:42:50.193 --> 02:42:52.395
COMFORTABLE WITH THE ASSERTION

02:42:52.462 --> 02:42:53.430
THAT A MISDEMEANOR MEANS

02:42:53.497 --> 02:42:56.900
NOTHING HOWEVER IF WE FIND THAT

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:59.202
THIS IS NOT CREATE THE EFFECT

02:42:59.269 --> 02:43:01.004
THAT WERE INTENDING AND WITH

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:02.873
THE HIGH FINES IN SECTION I

02:43:02.939 --> 02:43:04.741
REALIZED THE ORGANIZED GROUPS

02:43:04.808 --> 02:43:06.343
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY THE

02:43:06.409 --> 02:43:08.979
FINE SO AT LEAST- IF IT DOES

02:43:09.045 --> 02:43:11.014
NOT CREATE THE EFFECT THAT WE

02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:12.015
ARE TENDING BECAUSE I WANT

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:13.550
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A

02:43:13.617 --> 02:43:17.287
CLINIC SAFELY. AND OF COURSE WE

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:18.321
CAN RE ENTERTAIN THE- HIGHER

02:43:18.388 --> 02:43:23.193
PUNISHMENTS. SURE WINNER I

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:25.195
THANK YOU I THANK THE AUTHOR

02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:27.397

I AM WAS OPEN TO SUPPORTING

ON THIS ON THIS- ISSUE I DO

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:44.814
ONCE I THINK HI I CANNOT BEGIN

02:43:44.881 --> 02:43:45.882
TO COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES

02:43:45.949 --> 02:43:47.450
THAT I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNITY

02:43:47.517 --> 02:43:49.519
MEETINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO AS A

02:43:49.586 --> 02:43:51.788
SUPERVISOR AS SENDER RIGHT GOT

02:43:51.855 --> 02:43:54.858
INTO PUBLIC ARGUMENTS WITH

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:55.659
POLICE OFFICERS WHO. TELL THE

02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:57.961
PUBLIC- IT'S ONLY A MISDEMEANOR

02:43:58.028 --> 02:44:01.198
NOW- IF SAID AROUND PROP FORTY

02:44:01.264 --> 02:44:02.032
SEVEN TO MISDEMEANOR SO WE

02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:02.933
CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

02:44:02.999 --> 02:44:04.868
WHICH IS. JUST PATENTLY FALSE

02:44:04.935 --> 02:44:06.703
AND TO SIGNAL TO THE PUBLIC

02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:08.038
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:10.073
MISDEMEANOR SOMEHOW DON'T EXIST

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:11.875
ONE AS CENTER SKINNER QUICKLY

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:13.476
MENTIONED YOU CAN DO A WHOLE

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:15.378
BUNCH OF TIME IN COUNTY JAIL-

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:18.148
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE. AT

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:19.149
TIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO WILL

02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:21.585
NOT- TAKE ACTION ON

02:44:21.651 --> 02:44:22.919
MISDEMEANORS AND AT TIMES ARE

02:44:22.986 --> 02:44:26.323
SOME COUNTIES WHERE THE COURTS

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:27.023
TO AN ACTOR MAYBE THE DA. IT

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:28.692
DOESN'T ACT AND YOU KNOW MIGHT

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:29.659
BE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE AS WE

02:44:29.726 --> 02:44:31.161
NEED TO HAVE CONSISTENT

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:33.430
ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY-

02:44:33.496 --> 02:44:34.698
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.466
HAVE TO HAVE. YOU KNOW.

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:38.501
SHOCKINGLY LONG SENTENCES YOU

02:44:38.568 --> 02:44:40.403
CAN ACHIEVE. WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:44:40.470 --> 02:44:42.105
WITH YOU KNOW WITH SHORTER

02:44:42.172 --> 02:44:47.510
SENTENCES. SO I- YOU KNOW I

02:44:47.577 --> 02:44:49.779
ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY- IN OUR

02:44:49.846 --> 02:44:50.380
EFFORTS ARE CAMANCHE JUSTICE

02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:52.549
REFORM I DO THINK THAT THERE'S

02:44:52.616 --> 02:44:53.650
A LITTLE BIT OF DISTINCTION

02:44:53.717 --> 02:44:55.085
BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.254
AND I THINK. THE CRIMINAL

02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:00.190
JUSTICE SYSTEM IN GENERAL THE

02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:01.625
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING THESE

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:03.693
CRIMES AND THEY ARE CRIMES

02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:06.830
FRANKLY AT TIMES. CAN BE IT CAN

02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.598
BECOME VERY SOCIOPATHIC IN

02:45:08.665 --> 02:45:11.301
