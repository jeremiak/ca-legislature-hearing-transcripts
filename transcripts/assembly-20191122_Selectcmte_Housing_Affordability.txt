MELINDA JUST TALKED ABOUT THANKS ROLE AS THE COT IS STRIPPED. TO EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE BAY AREA THERE. NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS BY INCOME ARE WE HAD AS DETERMINED BY ATD. SO I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS THERE BECAUSE MONDAY ALREADY DEAD BUT- I'M NOT FINDING IT NOTE A BAG HAS. KICK OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH FOR AT THE BAY AREA NEED. TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THIRTY HOUSING PLANNING SIDE WELL. I'M. I'M PLANNING KICK THAT EARLIER THIS FALL. THE DEADLINE FOR ELECTING OUR RENOWNED CATIONS IS GONNA BE ON. AND ONE SO. AND WE'RE- GONNA BE PRETTY FAR ALONG TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE ARE THE BEST I'M REGION IN THE STATE SO WE ARE. THEIR BEHALF I KNOW I SPENT THE REST OF THE STATE. AND AFTER THAT YOU KNOW THE CITY IS THAT AND TOWNS THAT WE WITH ARE GONNA BE REQUIRED TO ZONE APPROPRIATELY. I JUST WE WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I'M A HUGE THANKS THE LEGISLATURE FOR ALL THE RECENT- RESOURCES THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED I IN THE LAST SESSION AND WITH SB TO. TO SUPPORT A BAG IN OUR WORK AND DOING THIS IMPORTANT PLANNING AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT GEN. I'M. SO ONE THING WE WANT TO TALK. ABOUT IS THAT WE REALLY KNOW THAT AND THEN BREAK DOWN. THAT'S IN THE PAST I'M THE HOUSING SHORTAGE. REALLY CUTE FIELD AND THE BAY AND IT'S- OF LIFE. AND HAS THE FIRST COALITION IN THE BAY AREA TO COALESCE AROUND A THREE D. FREIGHT TEN CENTS OF. WHAT WE DO IS AN TAX CHALLENGE. SO THAT THREE P. FRAME IS. IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS PRESERVE PORTABLE HOUSING THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND PROTECT CURRENT TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT- WE WERE REALLY HAPPY TO SEE ALL THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DAN AND LAST. TO EMBRACE THIS P. MARKET AND. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LOT OF WORK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE PLANNING PORTION OF PRODUCTION. SEVENTY IN WE SEEN I THINK IT DOESN'T WORK AND HOUSING ELEMENT BELLS BY MY COUNT. ON THAT ARE PUT LOCALS AND RECONSIDER PLANNING. A HOUSING THAT NEEDED TO COME. WORK. WE NOW CYCLE IS GONNA LOOK RELEASE CANTLEY DIFFERENT EFFECT IN THE PAST AND THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE IT ACTS AND AGAIN WORK ON IN OUR CYCLES WE DON'T FOR SURE WE EXPECTED THE HD WILL SHOOT TO THE BAY AREA ON A LARK OUR INCOME TARGET THAN AND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT- MODERATE TARGET READ RECENT YEARS I'M MRS IN THE CONTEXT ASIAN THAT THE AREAS TOTAL HAPPEN NEED A SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD. I'M ACTUALLY AT THE KNOWLEDGE YOU. EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT SENATOR WE SPELL I'M AND. THANKS A- LOT IT IS ME NEWS AT SKAGGS NUMBER- WAS THREEFOLD I HAVE HAD BÀN YES CYCLE SO LIMÓN IT'S KIND OF THIS ALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THE OTHER PIECE THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAT'S BEEN FOR MODERATE INCOME IS AT THAT WORKFORCE HOUSING HAS REALLY BEEN ELEVATED IN THE FAIR OUR DISTRICT AND CONSIDERATIONS. SO I'M WHAT. WHERE THE WHERE THE WINDOWS AT DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE BETTER ALIGNED WITH PROJECT. GROWTH TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE LOOK HOUSING. AND SEND. SENATE. MINIMIZING THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WORK. AGAIN AT ALSO OVER THE PAST THREE. NUMBER OF HOUSING ELEMENT LAW UPDATES I INTENDED TO PROVIDE THE POST FREENET SITE TO ACTUALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO. DATE THERE'S HOUSING NEED SO. THE HOUSING ACTION PROCESS IN THE PAST. BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THAT THE LEAD TEACHER BAGS POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP LET THIS PLAY OUT. AGAIN THE DEEPENING OF A NEW CYCLE YOU HAVE SOME TIME ASIDE WHETHER FROM THE SIXERS ARE WORKING ON AND GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD THE NEXT CYCLE THEY GET. IF WE'RE NOT SEEING WHAT WE WANT TO. ADEN AT. MAKE THE CHANGES ARENA IS NOT MEAN THAT WE DON'T THINK THAT SACRAMENTO CAN DO TO HELP WITH AFFORDABILITY FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. CENTER WINNER TALK ABOUT IT ALREADY OTHERS HAVE ABOUT IT ALREADY THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OUR INDECENT SECOND TAKE INTO LOOK AT REMOVING AND BARRIERS TO PRODUCTION AT LOOKING AND SOUNDING AND YOU KNOW MAKE HOUSING THE GROUND. THE PROCESS FASTER AND CHEAPER. AND ALSO I'M HEADING INTO A MEETING. THE DEEP SUBSIDIES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR AFFORDABLE FOR HOUSING AND THEN- ALSO THERE IS INVESTMENT IN. IT'S NECESSARY. STORE UP AND SEND TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT. TO MAKE WHEN HOUSING CONS MAKE THE QUALITY OF LIGHT I WORK. THE ENVIRONMENT THE SECOND HEARING OF THE- TODAY WHICH I REALLY. AS YOU WELL KNOW MIGHT NOT ALL INCOME MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING CLASS BUT THERE AT THAT THE VERY LOW IN BETWEEN THE LOW END OF THE INCOME SCALE. IT SAY THAT YOU THE CONTENT LET ME HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE- SAYS HER MIDDLE INCOME. AS WELL TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL. I REALLY WANNA AND. MELINDA AND ARE REALLY BIRD M. RENO PROCESS SORT OF ALL THE VARIOUS LAWS HAVE CHANGED I THINK WE'LL HAVE HOPE ARE GONNA PUT US ON A BETTER PATH. ON THE LAND USE AND ZONING AND IN THE FUTURE- BUT BUT I JUST WANT TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT- ON SOME OF THAT JUST SO WE SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT'S- GOING ON. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THE NATURE OF THE CRISIS. SO IT YOU KNOW. FOLKS ARE PROBABLY THEIR STATEWIDE 76% OF EXPAND. HOUSEHOLDS SO THAT. THEY'RE MAKING THIRTY. IN CONTRAST. INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THOSE WHO ARE AT EIGHTY TO ONE TWENTY AM I BEING. 4% SO 4% OF THEIR INCOME HOUSEHOLDS STATEWIDE. I THAN HALF THEIR INCOME IN RENT. NOW SHIFT TO LOOKING AT YOUR SAID LATE WE CALL THAT OVER FIFTY FOR THE EXTREME COST. COST BURDEN WHICH IS THOSE THAT ARE OVER 30% LESS THAN 50% THOSE NUMBERS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE GO CA. UP FOR THE MODERN COMPOSED. THE BIGGEST BURDEN CLEARLY AND THAT IS WHAT THE MUCH LESS. ABOVE MINE IN THE PROCESS 1% AND THEN ALSO SOME IMMEDIATE HOUSEHOLD IS A HIGHER PERCENT A MINE AND THEY'RE GIVEN REGION CAN AFFORD RENT THE AVERAGE RENT IN FIFTY TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN 90% OF THE STATE'S A COAT AS 10% OF THE CODE WHERE THEY CAN'T OR SPREAD ACROSS TWENTY SIX DIFFERENT COUNTY SO THEIR POCKETS AND A LOT OF THEM ARE NOT SURPRISINGLY IN THE BAY AREA. AND POCKETS OF LOS ANGELES AND ALONG THE COAST. IT IT AND JUST TO PUT SOME ADDITIONAL NUMBERS TO THAT SO LOOKING AT A FEW SPECIFIC CAPS AS EXAMPLES TO HELP FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE NATURE OF THE CRIME. SINCE INYO COUNTY THREE PER HOUSEHOLD. THAT THAT 83% OF AM I CAN AFFORD TO MEDIAN RENTS. SO THAT'S A SOLIDLY MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BORDERING ON ALMOST LOW INCOME AND THEN AND THAT'S FOR A TWO BEDROOM UNIT AND- GO NOT ONLY GOES QUITE. YOU NEED TO GET 210028% OF AM I TO FOR THE MEDIAN RENTS. IF YOU'RE A THREE PERSON HOUSEHOLD- AND SOME ADDITIONAL NUMBERS TO SEVEN OVERLOOKING OUT IN TERMS OF INCOME SO THING YOU COUNTY MEDIAN INCOME RIGHT NOW FOR A THREE PERSON HOUSEHOLD IS SEVENTY SEVEN SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AND THE UPPER LIMIT FOR A MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLD IS NOT THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND UNDER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S MEDIAN INCOME INTIMATE CISCO. AND INCOME TOPS OUT OF FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED. AND HAVE SOME CONTEXT OF LIKE HOW PEOPLE ARE MAKING AND- FIVE AS- INCOME IN. THAT LOT OF INTEREST FAQS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON I JUST WANT TO GET A SHOT BECAUSE- I DON'T REALLY THE HELP HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS. HARD WORK INTO ALL THAT. TO REALLY GIVE US THAT'S ALL. IS CAN AFFORD RENT WHO THREE. SO DOESN'T THAT THERE'S NO ISSUE AT ALL MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND- IN I THINK. IT DOES LOOK AT CHALLENGES OF MOVING INTO HOW SHIP YOU KNOW OUR OUR HARD BECAUSE THERE CAN BE A BIG THE COST OF A AND THE AVERAGE MEDIAN RENTS RIGHT SO EVEN IF YOU'RE- 40% OF YOUR INCOME AND- COST RENTAL UNIT THAT THE FOR. TO YOU THAT'S STILL KLAY ISN'T GET TRANSITION INTO A MUCH HIGHER COST. AT OF. PEOPLE AREN'T MOVING RIGHT I'M AND THEN CONTINUE A IN AFFORDABLE THAT AND INSTEAD OF MOVING INTO SHIP IN BEING ABLE TO BUILD THAT EQUITY WHICH WHICH WE WANT FOR PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT RATE HOW FAR PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO DRIVE TO FIND THAT MEETING COMMUNITY ACROSS THEIR COUNTY IT DOESN'T TALK A LOT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF. FINDING A PLACE WORK. LIVE ACTUALLY WORKS YOU CAN ACTUALLY CUT. IT'S AN COST SO BUT I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO THE CONTEXT THE SCALE. OF PRICES IN COMMERCIAL. AND WANT TO KNOW IT IT JUST AND I THINK IS INTERESTING IN A FULL CONVERSATION ABOUT MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING- LOOK WHAT ARE. THEY TALKING. SO LIKE ME RIGHT THANK. MIDDLE INCOME CUT A LEGAL CONTRACT THAT'S THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE AT ONE TWENTY A PERSON. MIDDLE THEY'RE PROBABLY. REALLY WIDE BAND OF FOLKS ALL THE WAY FROM VERY LOW INCOME ALL THE WAY UP TO PROBABLY. 50% AM I IT'S A MUCH BROADER SPOTTED PEOPLE SO A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN THE CAN BE AN AND ONE INTEREST JEFF WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA OF LATE AS- A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT JUST FIVE YEARS AGO WERE NOT MODERATE INCOME BEYOND. THE NO FAULT AS INCOME. IN SOME CASES VERY LOW INCOME BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING MEDIAN INCOMES GO UP AS WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF. IN A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S DRYING IT IN INCOME UP AND WILL SETTLE. TO THE BOTTOM AND. SO THAT'S SHIFTING PEOPLE INTO LOWER AND LOWER INCUMBENTS. SORT OF. CHALLENGE WE THINK THAT ADDRESS THE HOUSING. SO THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE DATA CONTEXT AT ING AND TO GET IT TO THE SORT OF THE PACIFIC QUESTION HANNAH MEET AYE AYE THE REMAINS REGISTER AYE THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES ARENA PROCESS IN LAST YEAR'S AND WE'RE- SIX HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE IN AND- YOU EVER. THERE READ A NUMBER IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN YOU. TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAH SO AND THEN THE NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THEM ALL AND EIGHT YEARS IF I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AND SEE DID THE CHANGES FROM. A AN AB. ONE ANOTHER BILL TRULY. COURSE THAT YOU KNOW THE READ IT DOES ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS. IT EXISTING AND MADE FOR HOUSING ACROSS THE- LAND. COME IS IN THERE- BUT I WOULD I DO THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY. HOUSING. IT'S NOT SO MUCH A SUBSIDY ISSUE FOR MIDDLE INCOME LIKE WE CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PRODUCES UNITS BUT WHAT WE WANT REALLY IS A BROADER RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES. STATE WE SHIFTED FROM OUR CITY IS HAVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TYPE OF HOUSING UNITS ARE. USED A LOT OF MULTI FAMILY WE HAD CORRECT AS WE HAD YOU KNOW BOARDING HOUSE THEN WE HAD DUPLEXES AND TRIBALISM FOR PLACES AND NOW INCREASING THOUGH WE SEE IS THEIR SINGLE FAMILY. AND THERE'S HIDING. APARTMENTS A LOT HAPPENING IN BETWEEN. AND I THINK ONE THING AND HOW COMMENT SO. ONE OF THE BIG THE THAT RAN A NUMBER RIGHT BIG RAN IT'S- IT'S BROKEN DOWN CITIES HAVE TO PLAN FOR AND THAT THE ONE OF THE BIG THINGS I HAVE TO DO AMONG MANY OTHER. IMPORTANT THINGS IN THE HOUSE NOT PROCESS IS YOU HAVE TO SHOW. ONE OF THEM'S OUT TO COMEDY THAT NUMBER. TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE THE LOW IN VERY LOW INCOME. THAT YOU HAVE TO POINT. PLEASE ON MULTI FAMILY. BUT THEN NOT MINE ABOVE MINE YOU CAN OUT. AT A 100% NUMBER SINGLE FAMILIES ON SITES. THAT DOESN'T REALLY. IN A JURISDICTION THAT'S NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SIGNING FOR DUPLEXES IN TRIAL EXCELLENT FOR PLEXUS CAN TELL THAT TO HAPPEN SO I THINK. CONSENT HOUSING ON A LOT OF THAT. IN THE ABOVE MY SOME PERCENTAGE THAT SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TOOK TO SITES ALLOW MULTI FAMILY MOMENT AT LEAST FOR SAYS RATE MAYBE HOW MAY BE TIRED TODAY. BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO WRITE. OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER THE JURISDICTION OR NOT. BROADER RANGE OF HOUSING TYPOLOGIES NOT ADDRESS SECTION. AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS HAPPENED IN THE TEXT OF. BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THAT HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS AND ONE THING IS WHEN YOU. PLACE THEM IN TWENTY MINUTES DECISION ARE YOU GONNA UPS ON AND WHERE YOU'RE NOT. YEAH IT. BUT HERE PERSONS OVER IS THIS GOING TO HELP US AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER FOR HOUSING MOUTHFUL OF ILLEGAL HAVE XIN BUT THAT EFFECTIVELY SAYS THAT M. NOT ENOUGH FIRST IS IN. THE STATE. AT THE END NOT DO THOSE THINGS DID NOT REPLY NOT DOES BAD THINGS WE NOW HAVE IN THE PAST YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THREE SHOWING YOUR- ACTIVE. UNDO THAT LEGACY. SYSTEM THAT ADDS THOUGH ANYTHING CALIFORNIA THE BILL IF WE REALLY THINK THOSE ZONING DECISIONS HAPPENING IN THAT CONTEXT NOW IS REALLY THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THAT BUT THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION HAVE THAT COULD ENABLE US TO REALLY I THINK MOVE. THE AGENDA YOU'RE HOPING TO PURSUE FURTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LAST UP ON THIS. THANK NUMBER GLORIA THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU TO THE OTHER MEMBERS PLEDGED TO FOR BEING I'M BILL FULTON- I'VE BEEN A URBAN PRACTICE OF FORMULA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS OF FORMER PLANNING DIRECTOR OF SAN DIEGO FORMER. MAYOR. AN ICE RIGHT ABOUT LAND USE POLICY ISSUES FOR PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT REPORT- I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT A FEW OBSERVATIONS TO TRY. CONGRESS CAN THINK. THE OTHERS YOU PANELS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF BEING OUT ONE OF YOUR POLICY CHANGES THE ASSISTANT. OF HAS GONE THANKS IN LARGE. THE WORK THAT THAT THE LAST THREE AT THERE'S A HUGE I THINK IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE FOR BOTH A C. H. CG AND BUGS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IN IN FOR TING OTHER ARENA. STUFF THE QUESTION AT HAND IS S. IS ON IT HAD REALLY IS- SHOULD WE LOOK UP YOU SHOULD WE DOUBLE EFFORTS IN EIGHTY ONE TO ONE TWENTY RANGE DID WE DO ABOVE THE LAW ALTHOUGH ABOVE THE 120% HUNDRED YOU KNOW BOB CURTIS THERE'S PEOPLE MAKE A 100% COME HAS MONDAY SEPT ELEMENT THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT UNTIL YOU TRY TO BUY A HOUSE. SO. TO SOME WOMEN THIS POINT YEAH I'M IT'S MY OBSERVATION THAT IN FACT. THE PRIVATE DEVELOPERS IN THIS BLOOM AREA REALLY ARE IN FACT BUILDING TO THE HIGH END OF THE MARKET THEY'RE NOT BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET I THINK THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITY IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S AN- DOWNTURN TO SET THINGS UP SO THE- MORE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MARK. AT ALL. GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. ON THE RIGHT IS IT WORTH CREATE OTHER LAYER IN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD IN THE ABOVE MODERATE RANGE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TO FIFTY OR A HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED SAN AYE THAT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT I THINK THAT IS A POLICY IDEA WORTH CENTERING THE QUESTION IS I THINK THEN WHAT DO YOU DO. RIGHT YOU OKAY FINE YOU HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER RIGHT IN THE RENO PROCESS YOU HAVE ANOTHER ANOTHER TARGET TO HIT. IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT. WHAT TOOLS DO YOU HAVE IN THE STATE THIS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS. TARGETS I THINK IT IS PUT. THAT IN A MINUTE. I THINK. TO THE CRITICAL QUESTION I THINK IS NOT NECESSARILY. IS THERE TARGET IN THE RENO WITH AS I SAY IS WORTH CONSIDERING BUT THEN WHAT TOOL DOES THE STATE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS STUFF ACTUALLY GETS BUILT BECAUSE IN THE END AS YOU ALL SAID AT DINNER TIME THE QUESTION HERE IS NOT HOW TO PLAY I DID GO TO CREATE A GOOD PLAN EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT TALKING AND THEY TAUGHT ME IN SCHOOL IT'S HOW DO YOU. MORE HAPPENING. ASPECTS IS THE SECOND ONE WHICH. TING TYPE A SECOND ONE IS THE OVERALL PLYWOOD WHICH- WHICH I THINK IT CAME UP EARLIER IS THE QUESTION OF TENURE WHAT TENURE WE SHOULD. ARE WE SHOOTING FOR MORE ARE WE SHOOTING FOR RENTAL HOUSING AND FINALLY FINANCING HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT OR HOW DO YOU HELP. HOW DO YOU HELP IT'S- TENANTS TENANTS OR HOME OWNERS PAY FOR IT. GOING THROUGH THOSE VERY QUICKLY. EACH ON THEIR OWN I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS HI I AGREE WITH ON THE- THAT REQUIRING FORCING OR OTHERWISE COURAGE IN OF THE READING COURAGE IN GEORGIA. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONSIDER A WIDER RANGE OF HOUSING TYPE IS A VERY GOOD IDEA AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION THE EXCELLENT ISSUE. AT THE EXIT POINT ON THE SUPPLY QUESTION I THINK YOU ALL SAID IT IS NOT YOU'VE ALL TALKED A VERY WAS ABOUT HOW THE. THE BARRIERS ARE HIGH NEED TO COME DOWN THEY HAVE DOWN IN MANY WAYS WE'RE THE WE'RE THAT TENDS TO GO IS WHERE THAT HAS TENDED TO GO ON IT GO IS TAKE A BREAK SINCE ELSEWHERE FOR IN ELEMENT THAT STILL PRETTY COMPLEX AND I RELATED TO THIS TOPIC SIMPLE FOR THIS OP OF A SAID I WAS HAVE A SET THING THAT. SIMPLE THANKS A IS ALWAYS REALLY COMPLICATED. I THINK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SIMPLIFY THE INFILL REQUIREMENTS IS IT IS. BUT THE LAST TWO POINTS TENURE. I THINK OTHER THINGS HERE WHAT. YOU REALLY GOING TO MISS THE TOUGH QUESTION OF WHAT. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE EIGHTY TO ONE TWENTY ENTER ONE TWENTY TO ONE FIFTY ONE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. HOW ARE WE TRY TO GET THOSE PEOPLE BECOME HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. OR HAVE WE IT'S THE DISTANCE IT'S WHERE I HAVE TO BE RENTERS AND IF THEY ARE PRINTERS HOW DO WE HELP THEM DO THAT HOW DO WE HELP THEM STABILIZE AND- IN RENT AN ILLICIT SO I WOULD GETTING TO THE- MISSING. ONE OF THINGS THAT WE- HAVEN'T. PLEASE LET PAST EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA IN GETTING MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE OR PEOPLE OF RELATIVELY MODEST MEANS INTO HOUSING. OR IT TOO TICKLING AND OWNERSHIP HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE THE POSTWAR EXPERIENCE HAS SOME RELEVANCE NOT A LOT OF RELEVANT BECAUSE THAT WAS LAND OF RICH LAND RICH CHEAP LAND BUT- WHAT THE FEATHER IN AT THAT POINT DID DO WAS CRY S. GREASE OF FINANCE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOWED. HOMER HOMEOWNERS TO BUY WITH VERY VERY LOW BY IN BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT'S VERY VERY LOW. PAYMENT AND I THINK YOU THINK ABOUT MIDDLE TRYING TO MAKE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING WORK AND MAKE IT WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF THOSE INCOMES. MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT THERE ARE THE ARE THE IS THERE SOME OF FINANCING PROGRAM. CAN UNDERTAKE OR EXPAND. THAT WOULD THAT WOULD EXPECT THE BILL OF THE OF MIDDLE INCOME READY TO GET INTO A AN EXPENSIVE. ON THE COSTA LOT OF MONEY BUT WE ON PAYMENT AND SO THAT. THE SYSTEM THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY. QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT. INCOME RESIDENTS AS RENTERS IS TO LOOK AT AMONG THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER STATES- PARTICULARLY PROBABLY THE PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE MIDDLE INCOME RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAM IN AMERICA ST. HELLO MY PROGRAM IN NEW YORK- WHICH WAS A NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES YOUR PROGRAM A WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY PROVIDED DEVELOPERS THE GUARANTEED RETURN IN EXCHANGE FOR BUILDING MIDDLE INCOME RENTAL OF PROJECTS- FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS. NEW YORK CITY UNDER MANY ALLAMA. AS I SAY THAT WAS A RENTAL PROGRAM THAT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT ONE FOCUS ON BUT IT MAY BE THIS POINT. BUT I THINK THE VERY RELEVANT POINT ABOUT SELAMA IT AND SIMILAR THREE ENGUERRAND RETURNS FOR DEVELOPERS. THAT IN A BULL MARKET. DEVELOPERS MAY NOT BE SO INTERESTED IN THAT BUT BUT IN A BUST MARKET AND I REMEMBER BEING A MAYOR DURING THE DURING THE LAST BUST AND WATCHING ALL OF OUR PROJECTS ALL OVER PRO PROJECTS TO. NIGHT YOU CAN MAKE THOSE SAME DEVELOPERS INTERESTED IN A DIFFERENT MARKETS. IF YOU PROVIDE THEM SOME SOME FINANCING INCOME STABILITY SO AS I SAY I THINK THE THOSE ARE FOR DIFFERENT ISSUE TYPE SUPPLY YOU'RE IN FINANCING AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT THOSE THANKS VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY BURGLAR. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ALL OF OUR PANELISTS I WILL TRY TO MEMBERS THE BEFORE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. IF ANYONE WANTS A- HE WOULD BE SHOT SENATOR GO FOR PLEASED THAT A WINNER. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THAT WAS ALL. THE I. HELPFUL AND I. WANT TO ASSIST BECAUSE I- I WAS CRITICAL OF THEM NOW I COMPLIMENT THEM OPPORTUNITY I CAN PUBLIC I WANT TO CONGRATULATE SCOTT AG- FOR REALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING- SCOTT I COULD TRY TO PROPOSE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS SHE CAME BACK. THREE NINE THANKS TO A SB TO. BE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE YES. NUMBER. THE BILL AND UPS GUY. THAT NUMBER AND ACCEPTED IT AND THEN THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE PUSHING A LOT OF THE DOG INTO THE KITCHEN OF ALLEN INLAND EMPIRE AND THEN THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND I. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OF LA IN. AND SCOTT A GOOD DOCTOR A STRONG MAN AND I BE I'D SHALL. SB THIRTY WILL HELP BECAUSE- WITH THREE THOUSAND UNITS HE SAID LIKE HUNDRED IN SANTA MONICA AS A BILL HAVE HUGE INCREASES- IT WAS A BIG SUPPORTERS OF CHOICES TO SCOTT FOR DOING THAT NO IT BAG IS GOING TO I'M. TO EVEN BETTER AND OUR OKAY. ONE TALK ABOUT IN A BOOK REMEMBER FRIEDMAN. I MENTIONED ABOUT BUILDING BY AN I THINK SOMETIME HE- VIEW THIS HOUSING AND VERY EASY HELPING FORCES LOOK TO YOU LUXURY AND ALL OF. WHAT'S LUXURY BECAUSE EXPENSE SEVEN IS EXPENSIVE IT IS NOT OFTEN BECAUSE THE SAME PEOPLE CALLING A LUXURY HOUSING STOPPED HOUSING FOR ANY. SO YES THERE IS DEVELOP THERE ARE IS TO HAS CLEARLY LUXURY WITH. EVERY POSSIBLE AMEND THE MORE PERSON AND. IS THERE ARE A- MYSTERY THAT IS THE JURY CONDO. I LOOK AT MY OLD ISRAEL THIS RECENT UPPER MARK A LOT OF THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT ARE BUILT THERE SURE IT'S NEW CONSTRUCTION SO IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THERE'S NOTHING FANCY ABOUT IT IS HOUSING THAT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO IT'S LIKE IF YOU GO AND RENT A HUNDRED YEAR OLD FLAT INSTANCES GO AN OLD ACCORDION THAT'S I EVEN NOT GREAT SHAPE IT MIGHT COST YOU THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH TO WRITE. BECAUSE IT'S A LUXURIOUS BUT IT'S. AIR SOME EXTENSIVE FAMILY HOMES. SELLING FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHATEVER THEY'RE SELLING FOR HELLO FOR A TEN. A SINGLE HOME OUT OF NOT. BECAUSE IT SCARES AND EXPENSIVE SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT IT THE HIGH END LUXURY WHICH ARE SOME OF THAT BUT WHAT'S AND SEVEN EVERYTHING. A HUNDRED YEARS OLD OR SIX OLD IT'S ALL EXTRA AS IS NOT ENOUGH OF IT. AND ARE YOU FOR DEVELOPER BECAUSE WE MAKE IT. LONG AND EXPENSIVE TO ACTUALLY LEARN ANYTHING YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE COULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO GO MORE TOWARDS THE HIRING BECAUSE THAT'S ALL. AND I FIGURE FOR ABLE TO BRING CALL ON A LOT OF WAYS. WE CAN. THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN I WAS TRYING TO LISTEN CAREFULLY DOLLARS WANTED ASK I KNOW DOES NOT WAS MOST RAP RENO BUT- DO ANY OF YOU HAVE KILLER POLICY PROPOSALS ON WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO TO THIS SO CALLED MISSING WORKING CLASS. HOUSE NOT SURE I. THEY HER REFLECTIONS IN STATE BUT I. ROLL AM I CORRECT YOUR ANYTHING PARTICULAR THAT ACTUAL FOR US. AT THE RISK OF THE LAST. BUT IF YOU COULD SIMPLIFY IT AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU SAY IDEA WAS WE REALLY CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE FORMAL SIDE. BECAUSE THE- CLASS AND WORKING CLASS NUMBER SIR OR SO MUCH SMALLER THAT WAS. TO HEAR WHAT YOU SAID THE ONE THE ONE CONCRETE SUGGESTION I HAVE IS THAT I THINK IN THE SITE TO MENTOR AND. I'M AS I WAS SAYING ALL ALONE THE VERY LOW INCOME NUMBER HAVE TO GET ALLOCATED TO MULTI FAMILY SITES. RIGHT BUT THEN YOU CAN PUT A HIGH RISK MODERN YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT ON. THAT SCHEDULE WITH. ALLOW BURKE HI. MEANT WHETHER IT'S FOR PLACES ARE FRANKLY MARK. APARTMENTS I GET A BROADER RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES I'M ESPECIALLY THE BIG GREEN IN NUMBERS ON A LOT OF. THINGS MUCH BIGGER NUMBERS AND THAT KIND OF SHIFT WILL. YOU KNOW IN ADDITION. TO THE ZONING GONNA HOW COME TO THOSE NUMBERS THAT THAT'S. YOU KNOW EIGHT ALL CONSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT DISPLACEMENT AND IT WILL. THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO BRING IN NEW DEVELOPMENT OF PLACES WHERE MY CLIENTS LIVE NOW GREAT MY LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE. THEM TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN EXCLUSION. IF THEY WANT. WHICH THEY CAN'T BUT IT. I'M PROCESS IF WE MAKE THOSE ON HOW SAYS IT ALSO. AN ANALYSIS BY IMPORTANT WHICH IS WHY I LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING IT THERE. THANK YOU. OTHER I AGREE WITH THAT IS IT IDEA I THINK. IN MY REFLECT THIS WHAT'S THAT I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR SOME KIND OF COMFORT. THAT NECESSARILY INVOLVE. THAT PASTORE DEEP'S CITY YOU DON'T KEEP WITH THE FOR LOW INCOME WHAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER UP. WERE ALL INCOME TO GET TO THE HOT DOG AND ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC IDEA THAT RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'D BE HAPPY. PLUS FOR YOU I WOULD LOVE YOU. LAST COUPLE YEARS I. WOULD HAVE BOUGHT A PROPERTY TAX EXCLUSION FOR. A DIFFERENT. HAD COME TO US FOR THE. PERCENT MIA TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE. IT'S **** THESE DON'T FOR OTHER. IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT SUBSIDY WOULD BE IN THE TRADE OFFS WITH LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE IS HARD SO I'M ALMOST TO THE POINT HAVING TRIED THAT A COUPLE TIMES DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AS MUCH UP TAKE FOR THAT THAT. AYE AYE MAY I BE HEARD ON ORDER. A PROPOSED OUT OKAY. QUESTION FROM ARMS THING IN MELINDA'S. POWER POINT AND JUST A QUESTION OF. HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS ON THE GROUND. THE YOUR ASSERTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THEIR HOUSING GRAHAM SO YOU MENTION YOUR WAS REMOVING IN MITIGATING BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT AND I WONDER BESIDES BUT ENTIRE CITY. BEING STE BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OPENING I COME TO THE HAVE SOARED ANORA PLANNED DO. LOOK WE GET ABOUT THE WAY THAT. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE AN APPROVED HOUSING. AND I'LL JUST I'LL THROW OUT A SAMPLE I CALLED FOR ME. BUT I DID THREE BILLS ABOUT EIGHTY ACTION LAST YEAR I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A CITY. WHERE I. IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD WITH VERY LARGE LOTS BECAUSE MY CITY REQUIRES THAT EVERY STANDALONE EIGHTY YOU AFTER. ON SITE. NO PART IN ANY OF THESE. ON THIS PURPOSEFULLY. AND HE NOTHING FROM EUROPE OR AGENCY THAT PUSHES BACK DAHLE ON CITIES AND ASKING THEM TO JUSTIFY AN ORDINANCE THAT THAT YOU KNOW IS CLEARLY MEANT. COURAGE AND BY THE WAY IN THIS GAME NEIGHBOR. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A 40% LIVE LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENT FOR FRONT SETBACKS SO JUST TO YOU. IT WAS. SO HOW. YES SO THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TIMES IN WHICH HE- KIND OF TAKE A LOOK AT ANY ISSUES SAYS- FIRST IS AND THE REVIEW OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH IT COMES ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEAR AND AT IS ON THAT TIME FRAME SO IT WILL TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT ABOUT REMOVING. BARRIERS I AM LOOKING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. TING WHAT ARE THEY EIGHTIES ENTER WESLEY GIVEN ALL THE LAWS AND- AT AT WHAT NOT. MY DEAR. EXCEPT FOR MULTI IN A MULTI FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT THE STATUTES AS IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IDENTIFIED THEN YOU HAVE A PROGRAM TO REMOVE THEM AND MITIGATE- WHICH MEANS WE WILL LOOK FOR A PROGRAM SUCH AS- IN CYCLE MOBILE OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS FOR MULTICAST. AND MULTI FAMILIES OUT. VIEW STAGE RIGHT AND SO THAT IS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEARS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK. EIGHTY SEVEN TWO WE HAVE THE NEW FORSMAN THORIUM AND HOUSE WE PROVIDED SOME TECHNICAL. INSTITUTE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THEM IN THE DECISION MAKING. MORE TEETH NOT SO WITH STANDING UP. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND THEN ALSO WITH THE NEED TO LEGISLATE ASKED WE HAVE FORTY AROUND UP LOOKING. EIGHTY TWO ORDINANCES. AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FINDINGS AND PER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE HAVE THAT. WE GET ON A COMPLAINT BASIS RIGHT NOW THROUGH OUR OUR WEBSITE. INFORMATION ABOUT ISSUES AT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE. DEVELOPERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE TRYING. TO THAT PROP US EVEN QUESTIONS FROM LOW BERMAN IMPLEMENTS PIECES OF LAW AND WE PROVIDE FIRST. LET THOSE WE HAVE IT AS A KIND OF IT. ANTI PROCESS WE START WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN- FINDINGS AND THEN FROM. EVENTUALLY GET TO THE WE'VE BEEN THIS YEAR THROUGH A LOT OF OUR WORK AROUND THIS ISSUE THAT. THE TIME WILL WE PROVIDED. THINGS SEEM TO OUT WELL- AND IF NOT THEY WERE GOING CONTINUE TO. THE REQUEST. AND DO THAT INVESTIGATION WORK AND IT DOES TAKE SOME STOP YOU BECAUSE I IT'S ONE THING TO DO. BARRIERS AT CITY YOU ALWAYS USE TO STOP ABOUT AND THOUGHT THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR OWN. SEEN THAT DO THAT. BUT WHEN THEY'RE THEMSELVES BECAUSE- WITH WITH YOU HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT JURISTIC MEAN THESE HAVE RIGHTFULLY ADOPTED CODES THAT. WILL SLIP TOP I'LL MAKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST SAID DOESN'T APPLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO COMPLAINING TO THE THEIR FOLLOWING THEIR OWN RULES WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THESE ARE PUTTING BARRIERS UP ON PURPOSE. ALL MANNERS OF HOUSING- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE COMPLETE BUT OCCASIONALLY FROM DEVELOPERS WERE THERE FOLLOWING THEIR OWN RULES THEY'RE ASKING FOR- MEDICATIONS AFTER PROPOSED HAPPENED GIVE AND YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT DIFFERENT STORY I'M- SAYING THAT YOU MAYBE THINK A LITTLE. BIT MORE BROADLY. THIS IS EVEN. IF YOU TO. TELLING YOU THAT THE PRETTY. I WAS HAS VERY SIMILAR ORDINANCES AND- WE'RE DOING IT ON PURPOSE TO STOP BUILDING OF AT AND OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING AND THEY MAKE A DOT ALL THE READ THE NUMBERS THEY WANT BUT WHEN THEIR OWN CODES MAKE IT. PROHIBITIVELY X. FOR. I DO YOU FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE ARE. SO JUST THROW OUT. THIS IS FRIEDMAN I'LL TRY TO BE EFFICIENT I KNOW IT NUMBER JORDAN YOU YOU MENTIONED EMBARK ON- THAT I CALLED PREVENT TALK ABOUT BASED THESE LAWS PASSED RECENTLY IN THE DISCUSSION AT YOUR BOARD LEVEL WHAT DO YOU SEEN IN TERMS OF DISCUSSION I KNOW THAT INDIGO HAS BEEN PAYING BACK HOME THE DIFFERENT PROCESS. I'M IN OFFICES WIENER VISIONS THE FACT THAT HE'S A BIG THINGS FOR ME WHAT. KIND. OF QUESTIONS ARE. THE MEASURE LOCAL WANTED. SURE I'M- WE ARE- EARLY ON AND DOES THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS AT THE BOARD LEVEL BUT- YET BUT WE HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR OUR- HAVING A LOT A LOT LIKE THE OFFICIALS AND I'M REPRESENTATIVES FROM A- BUNCH OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AROUND. THE COMMUNITY HE TRANSFERRED IN. THERE I AM IN WHAT WE CALL THE HOUSING THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE ON MEETING TO TALK ABOUT ONE TO GET OUR NUMBER FROM EACH C. D. HOW ARE WE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE IT ACROSS THE REGION AND- WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST THAT I THINK WILL BE MORE PROBABLY ROBUST THIS TIME. ROUND LOOK I. LOOK AT WHAT THE JOBS HOUSING CONNECTION PEACE IS GOING TO BE ANYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE OUT LAST TIME AROUND WHEN HE TRIED TO. I TRIED TO GIVEN. I IT NUMBERS UP SO GIVING HIGHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING NUMBERS TO JURISDICTIONS THAT HIGHER NUMBERS OF LOCAL JOBS. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST I THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT CAN WE STRENGTHEN NOT ON. TIME AROUND SO YOU KNOW VERGE L. REALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES. I ALSO LIKE TO SAY IS THAT BILL TALKED ABOUT. I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. I'M HOW CAN WE TRY TO ADDRESS SOME PORTABILITY FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ALSO IN THE LOOKING AT. TING BARRIERS PRODUCTION FOR ALL TYPES OF HOUSING CAN HELP AT THAT MIDDLE AND PEACE AND- A LOT OF THE WILL HAVE FRUIT. GUYS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SOME PRETTY AMAZING ACTION ON ON A BIG THIS IS THE COST AND SO BIG THIS IS THE AFFORDABLE SUBSIDIES. NUMBER OF BILLS THAT ARE THAT ARE. TO HAVE BEEN TO EUROPE. I'M ANY OTHER PIECES AROUND. GETTING HOUSING PRODUCTION TO GO FASTER. SOME OF THE. LOOKING AT THROUGH MINISTERIAL- APPROACH THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT C. GREG'S ACTIONS TO SUPPORT AND FELL OUT WHICH IS THE TYPE OF MAN IS LOCATION EFFICIENT I CAN ALSO HELP ADDRESS THE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AFFORDABILITY ORANGE WHICH REALLY THOSE ARE THE TWO BIGGEST PIECES OF. MOST HOUSEHOLDS. I'M AT BUT RIGHT NOW SEE THE STREAM. ROBERT WHO HAVE BEEN. IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLICATED ON THE SHORE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO EXPIRE IS EASY WITH STREAMLINED- FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA OPEN TO LITIGATION. JUST GONNA GO THROUGH. STATUS ALL WHERE IN. YOU KNOW OUR PEACE. IF YOU'RE DRESSING BILLS COMING UP BECAUSE IF I SEE. TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND- IF ANY OF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT SO IT'S. THERE IS NOT CALLED ME UP. DOMINO'S FORTY TO GO A KIND OF THING UP BIT OF A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT WE- ACTUALLY WE'RE THERE'S ENOUGH MAKING UNITS TO US FOR INSTANCE THE HOUSE READY THAT THERE'S REALLY NO HOUSING PRICE CRISIS THAT THIS IS A- MANUFACTURER THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST- BUILDING THINGS AND HOLDING THEM FAKE AND ARE. HOLDING ON A UNIT CAN AND THEIR- PURPOSE EITHER BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANT YOU KNOW THE MOST IS WHAT THE TIMES YOU KNOW ARGUED THERE. IT'S MORE AFFAIRS THAT IS TRYING TO DRIVE A BY. I AM ALWAYS BE SOME BREAKING IT IS ME MAYBE ON THEM DON'T LIVE THERE YEAR ROUND YES. IT'S THAT AREN'T READY YET. THE NUMBER SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IT'S AN ANY TIME ARE INTO COULD BE RENTED THAT ARE YOU CONSIDER READY TO TOWN AND WHAT IF ANY. I'VE SEEN. DO YOU THINK I MEAN COUNTY IS. PEOPLE COURT SO DO YOU THINK THAT THIS REALLY ISN'T A FACTOR. PRESS TO MAKE IT A SURE WE ARE PEOPLE AGO FOREIGN LA TO SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE BUILDING AND ANGER NO HOPPING CRISIS THERE'S NO LACK SUPPLY I IT'S ALL JUST. VACANCIES. KICK IT OFF. A PRETTY VACANCY RATE AMONG A LOT OF THE TRUE LUXURY ANNONCES ENTERTAINER WAS TALKING ABOUT OUR LIVES GET SNAPPED UP BY FORTY TWO IT'S REALLY TRULY DISSONANT. AND THEY DON'T NEED TO RUN TODAY. BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE PLAYING OUT OF EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY ON THE STATE IT'S REALLY IN THOSE. HOT MARKETS THAT ARE. SO EXAMINE CISCO LA PLACES THE- GLOBAL CITIES. I'M AT THINK ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH DODD WHICH WE'VE SEEN IN VANCOUVER HAVE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH HIS IMPOSING A TAX. THAT MEANS THAT. AND QUITE SUCCESSFUL DAY AND SO. HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR CÁC I THINK IT WOULD TAKE UP THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE ON A STATEWIDE BASIS IT FEELS IN A LOT OF WEIGHTS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT. A PARTICULAR TO A BIGGER MARKET AND IS TO BE. A LITTLE TOO BUT PERHAPS THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT. I THINK WE DO HAVE A ONE CITY RIGHT BUT IT IS KIND OF THAT CITY THAT WILL CITY MUCH LIKE THE PLAGUE SAME. RATES AMONG THE SET OF UNIT SO I THINK IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS WE KNOW WE'RE SHORT. UNITS IN THE STATE DRAMATICALLY SO YOU SEE THAT BUT IT'S NOT WHAT I HEAR FROM. CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THE NARRATIVE THE DOUBT THEIR COMPUTER ONE MORE THING IN THERE. THEY WILL YOU KNOW CUT BONTA DISCARDED AND WE HEAR IT FROM HOW BECAUSE. THEIR WORK BUT DISPLACEMENT AND THEN ALSO HAVE PIPPIN SEE ABSOLUTELY NO SO MY PROBLEM YEAH THIS IS ALL A BIG LIE IT'S ONLY. SHIRTS SO. YOU KNOW WHAT IT. YEAH. WAS ONE AND I AM IS A CASUALLY IN I THINK A PART OF OUR CHALLENGE RIDE TALK ABOUT. IT IS THAT PROTECTIONS FOR. PEOPLE I AM IT DOT FOR INVESTORS. LOOKS AT A RABBIT FOR A FULL TO ACTUALLY IS FOR KIDS AND THEIR GRANDKIDS ARE MAKING THEMSELVES ON AN- ANCIENT AND THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS. RIGHT RIGHT DIVERSITY PRODUCT. SOME VERY INNOVATIVE STUFF I'VE SEEN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I'M THE ONLY MATCHING I GREW UP WITH BUT SEEMS RELATIVELY POPULAR TERMS OF SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THEN IT AND WHATNOT AND- WE INCENTIVIZE THAT TO THE. I DON'T KNOW BUT MAKES POINTS. MAYBE IT TO WRAP UP. IN THE I'D BE INTERESTED IN WHAT OWNERSHIP THE CHAIR. THE LEGISLATIVE SUGGEST BUT. YOU KNOW MY OFFICES DOORS BY. THE IT. YOU MAY FOR RELIEF FROM POINT IN THAT AND I APPRECIATE AND OF MAKING THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS IN THE TOP. CUSTOM. RECALL ABOUT HOW WE'RE USING. IS INSTREAM- BUT IF THERE'S A SORT OF GATE ON THAT I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A CALL THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE- DOING. ON THAT ARE SO THE. HERE I THINK THAT I THINK ONE SOME OTHER THINGS BUT. BUT OKAY HOUSING. AND THE COST XIN HIM THE STATE RIGHT NOW CLEAR BEST OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR. PART OF THAT. SEEM TO ME THAT ONE OF THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE THING SO I'M NOT IN THIS THE STATE IS A WORK FOR IT BOB AND PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE A- OF. CONSTRUCT IS THAT EVERYBODY. I AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GOT AN UPPER LIP PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF CONSTRUCTION LABOR RIGHT AT THAT THAT'S ONE THING. ANOTHER POINT WHICH UP ABOUT UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN DOES NOT YOUR POINT BUT BUT GHOST OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IN NEW AREAS. IS ONE OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE IS A LAND USE PLAN ARE HAVING SAY OVER THE YEARS AS- TELL TYPICALLY WANT TO DEVELOP ON PRESS COME SIT ALONE PROCESS. AS ALL OF YOU KNOW- DID GET THE DENSITY GETS KNOCKED DOWN IN THE PROCESS EIGHT YOU YOU'VE ALL SEEN THAT. I'M AN EXCEPTION TO THAT IT REALLY WHEN THERE IS A SPECIFIC AND PLANTS- WHEN THERE IS A FOR ALTHOUGH THAT CAN BE. A TIME. I MEAN FOR AN EXPENSIVE FRONTAL SAYS. NEVER THE LESS THE RESEARCH DIED. YES THAT IS A THIS OFTENTIMES THERE'S A TRUCK GOOD SIGNAL IF YOU ARE AT AND YOU BE ABOUT A DOWN THE CITY YOU SEE A 1100% APPROVAL RATE. AND FOR CALIFORNIA PLANET REPORT WORKING RIGHT NOW ON AN ARTICLE ABOUT ABOUT THE- HELLO OF EVIDENCE. IN EL SERENO WHICH HAS BEEN A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE. SO. I WOULD SEE BEYOND REGULATION BEYOND FUNDING. OF THE OF THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPING FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. THE USE IN THE RIGHT SITUATION OF SPECIFIC PLANS LAID THE GROUND AND GET EVERYTHING SET UP AHEAD OF TIME SO THEY WIND UP IN THAT KNOCKDOWN DRAG. COME AT UPS. AT THE PROJECT LEVEL. THANK YOU SIR AND I WOULD JUST BEYOND FOR THE BEYOND THE SESSION NEW LEGISLATION WHICH TYPICALLY IT'S LIKE ME CAN BE HELPFUL FOR THE EVENT OUT AND HE'S OUT I THINK ONE OF THE. IS OVERSIGHT- AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A GREAT DEAL JUST PLACE THIRTY TODAY'S. HOW DOES IT IS HARD AS THE MEAN IT. WAS GONE AND THAT THINGS HAVEN'T PLAYED IT OUT. GIVEN THAT WE HAD BOTH A HOUSING CHAIRS. TODAY IN SOME TIME TO GO BACK AND LOOK AND SEE YOU KNOW IT IS A THE ACTIVITIES. OF OUR WE GAUGING WITH AG'S OFFICE TO FOLLOW ON AND MAKE. THEIR FAIR PART HOW THE WHOLE AGENCIES IMPLEMENTING SOME THIS. I'M EVEN IF IT'S IN PROGRESS B. THINK ABOUT OFFICIALLY TIME. DEGREES NAY LOCAL COMMUNITIES UP TO THESE CHANGES. YES SO THAT WE DON'T WHEN WE HAVE MIDDLE PORTION. DO I THINK IT'S WHERE YOU'RE SORT OF BRINGING UP YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I THINK WE ONLY KNOW OF OUR CONSTITUENTS BY NOT PROVIDING WHAT THEY WERE PROMISED INTENDS ITALY ON THE CAN OF WHAT IN THE ABILITY. TO SOMETHING IN DAHLE TWELVE I MIGHT FOR THE FACT HI A UNIT THAT SOMEONE WHO SHOULD MAKE IT A LOT LESS MONEY HE SHOULD. BE RENTING A BECAUSE I CAN FOR THE NEXT ROUND IT'S ON CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TOWN'S BUT ALSO THE CHALLENGE RIGHT AND SO- YOU KNOW- AS WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NEXT STEPS THAT ARE MAYBE SOME OF THE BEST TIME TO BE USED ON A PROVIDING. THE OVERSIGHT ASK THE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING UP WITH. AFTER UNDERSTOOD. WE DOING. WORKING IN AND WHAT MORE MAY NEED TO BE DONE. MANY FOR COMMENTS MADE ON THE- WE CHECK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOU THIS AFTERNOON. CHECK THIS. TO OUR PANELISTS. IN THE AUDIO. AND THE LARRY WILL BE JOINING US. THE PRESENTATION AGAIN WILL TAKE- MAY NEVER QUESTION AFTER THEY PRESENT WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE IS A PUBLIC COURT HERE WAIT FOR THAT SHOULD MAKE THE TIME UNLESS YOU HAVE A PRISON CALIFORNIA BE WHO ARE HERE WITH. IT'S NOT SURPRISING IN THE LEAST. GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE. WELCOME. AIR AND GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK BETTER DOES ON ISSUES AROUND HOW OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU SO MUCH- IN IN IN THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I AM. THE RESEARCH AT THE TURN CENTER FOR HOW THE- KLAY. I'M I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE DONE AROUND DEVELOPMENT IS AN- THE- SO. NOT THIS COMPENSATION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE WERE. DIFFERENT IS I'M A THING FROM QUIMBY IT IS TO DO IT HARD. TO IF YOU FELT THAT CAN PROJECT. IMPACT ALL OF THE MEDICATION YEAH. SOMETHING THAT WE STRESSED IN BOTH OF OUR REPORT AROUND THEM AND FEES AND IMPACT FEES I FUND VERY PORTENTS THIS IS THIS IS REALLY NEAT. TO SUPPORT NEW RESIDENTS. OUR RESEARCH IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX INCREASE. ON IN TO FIND CAMPUS THE WAY. SO WHAT COUNTIES REPLY ON REVENUE GREAT EXTENT THAN THEIR. AND THIS I'M YOU IN TO THE INTERSECTION HENCE PASTORS AND. AND ADDITIONAL GEN. CALIFORNIA. REVENUE PROPERTY TAXES CLIMB FROM PERCENT OWNED REVENUE IN NIGHT. SIX AND TWELVE THAT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO A POLICIES LIKE PROP THIRTEEN THAT DO LIMITS ON. PROPERTY TAX THE LEVY GOVERNMENTS. WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT THIS AND THIS TRIP IS CONCERNING BECAUSE OF THE BODY OF IMPAIR BUTTONS DOES DRAW A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN. ISN'T AND HOUSE PRICES. ARE THE SAM'S LOCAL MARKET THEY MET HOUSING PRODUCTION PRICING OUT NEW. FEES ARE TOO HIGH SIX KILLER LEAVE MORE AFFORDABLE TYPE PROJECTS MAY NOT PENCIL OUT ABOUT. SO FIRST REPORT WAS RELEASED IN NUMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IN COURT WE ACTION. LATER THE FULL AMOUNT. IS EXCLUDING UTILITY. FOR PRODUCT OF FAMILY. DEVELOPMENT EXTRA ACTIONS PROCESS AND WE FOUND THOSE. SIX THIS IS POSSIBLE. IN FACT WE FOUND THAT SOME CASES REPRESENT UP 218% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY VALUES MR. MOST RECENT REPORT ON IMPACT FEES STEMMED FROM ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THAT WAS WRITTEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRACE. OF THE ROAD FOR THAT STEP WAS TO. THE SYMBOL OF LOCAL CHARGE YOU TO MEN'S. SECTION THE SIX THOUSAND SO THAT'S IN THE NATION. AND AGAIN THAT'S THE IMPACT YOU AXOLOTL JUST. IN THAT REPORT JUST LOOKING AT IMPACT FEES THAT FALL UNDER THE MEDICATION FEET. THEY AGAIN VERY WIDELY BY FICTION THEY CAN BE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. WE ALSO FOUND THAT INSTEAD. ARE YOU. SO MORE. CONSIDER IN DEVELOPMENT I THINK THESE THINGS HOW. I THINK MORE GREEN ABOUT ARE PRIORITIZING THINGS THINGS TRANSPORTATION. POURTANT POINT FOR THIS CONVERSATION. CAN AN ADVISER TO INCENTIVIZE TYPE. SO IF YOU LOOKED AT HER DOOR. THEY ACTUALLY. WHERE BEAR BAIT THING THERE SAMPLES. HE'S UP FOR YOU PLACE IS GOING INSANE. THANKS ABOUT. I'M GOING TO BE PARKS BOB BROWSE CHARGING IS ON A SCRIPT. THIS IS AN CENTER IS THAT SIR. MORE AND THE STATE. ALSO TURNING LOWER FEES TO REFLECT THE LESSER IMPACTS THE GAMBLING DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE SITUATED NEAR TRACK. OR WHEN THEY ARE FOR. I CAN INCENTIVIZE THOSE AFFORDABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. JUST A STEP BACK. AS I KIND OF CLOSE OUT MY TALK. I WANTED TO MENTION. WHY. SO THAT WE ARE SEE WHAT COMES UP. PLOT THAT. TING TOOLS MORE FAMILY TO HELP AND WE ARE SEEING LAST NOVEMBER. THE ONE LARGE METRO AREA. THE SINGLE I NEED HELP ARE MUCH MORE LIKE TO BE IN THE TOP. SO IN SUMMARY WE NEED TO BE USING AS MANY TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL AS POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE MORE OF ONE SUSTAINABLE HOUSE TYPES INCLUDING DANCEABLE. CONSTRUCTION AND WE SHOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO FUND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THAT IMPACT THESE DON'T AFFECT THE- THREE OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AND TO LEVERAGE. FOR THE MILLIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU HAILING. GET YOUR NAME ON SSA RIGHT RANELLIDAE VALLEY. RANELLIDAE VENTILATING HASN'T RALLY THAT. VISIT OPEN THEIR LIVE THE SACK THANK YOU. I THANK YOU BUDGET. I REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND- TO CUT SPRINT'S WITH THE ADOPTED TO DEVELOP AN IMPACT FEES IN OAKLAND- WHICH IS OFTEN HELP AS A MODEL OF A GOOD WAY TO DO IT- SO I'M GONNA SHARE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCES FOR DOING THAT AND THEN ALSO ALL. COLLECTIONS ON WHERE WE THINK THE STATE COULD HELP. THOUSAND SIXTEEN HE DID A COP SWEET. IS THE FOCUS FOR WILL HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND CAPITAL FACILITIES THAT'S THINGS LIKE HOUSES PARKS AND SO FORTH. 80% OF THE FEE GOES FOR ABOUT HOUSING SO THIS IS REALLY A HOUSING IMPACT FEE PROGRAM. ARTICLE TEAM THAT DIDN'T STUDIES- FINANCIAL STABILITY AND WE HAVE A DOT IS THAT WERE SMALL AT FIRST THAT GREW OVER TIME TO GIVE THE MARKET I'M TO. THE FEES ARE SET BY GEOGRAPHIC HOME BASED ON. FINANCIAL FEET BLOODY BECAUSE A GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT TO DESCRIPTION NEW DEVELOPMENT THEY'RE ALSO SET UP PRINT TYPES BECAUSE- TYPES DIFFERENT. BILL EIGHTIES THE TEST WAS VERY TRANSPARENT WE HAD A WEBSITE WITH ALL THE RIVER POSTED WE HAD A COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WAS COMPRISED OF DEVELOPERS- AT THIS FOR DIFFERENT- PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY HOW EXPERTS AND SO FORTH. THE CONSENSUS ON WHAT THIS PACKAGE WOULD BE. THE FEES OF VERY. SOME OF THE CITY THERE WAS NO FEE AT FIRST. SOME PARTS OF THE CITY WHERE THE MARKET IS A. HAVE A MUCH HIGHER FEE. SINCE THOSE FEES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED WE HAVE. BEEN A SLOWDOWN IN DEVELOPMENT IN FACT IF YOU COMPARE THIS REPAIRS PRIDE FEET COMPARED TO THE THREE YEARS AFTER THAT. WE ARE SUPPLY MARKET RATE HOUSING. I AM. OAKLAND HAS A THOUSAND UNITS UNDER. MORE HOUSING IN ANY CITY IN THE BEAR. IN TERMS OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING. AT THE RELEVANCY FOR APPROACH. THE EGGS DID. COME RESTRICTED ON HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE FEE. SUBSIDY FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING IS AN EL WILL USE. AND WE ALSO EXEMPTED EXCESS. ON THE FEE WHICH IS YOU KNOW IS A GOOD SOURCE OF ON. YOU KNOW FOR THE IS. TO ADOPT THEIR EXPECT. IT WILL OUR CONTRACT ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS THE CONSULTANT TOOK OVER A YEAR. HAVE THE CAP THE TO DO THAT BUT A LOT OF SMALLER THESE ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE. SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA. THE BEST PART. IS THE FOLLOW ON THEY'RE GONNA NEED HELP ON IT RATHER THAN EVERY CITY REINVENT THE WHEEL DOING. ANALYSIS I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A ROLE FOR THE STATE. TO CREATE SOME KIND OF TAX CALCULATOR BECAUSE REALLY UP. US AND RENTAL PRICES AND IF YOU DO THAT ZIP CODE TO SOME BY GEOGRAPHY STATE THAT'S A LITTLE JURISDICTIONS TO DO THIS MUCH MONEY. THANK YOU. JERRY FISHEYE BY WHITE MALES OF. LARRY YOU LASSEN PANEL FOR SHORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TRY TO BE JUST MISSION. BEYOND PRESENT ABOVE CAL'S. THANK NEXT YEAR. AND WE'VE OVER FIVE THAT AFFORDABLE HOMES AND CURRENTLY OWN AND MANAGE OVER 4% HOMES IN THE NORTH. WE ARE. PERHAPS BEST KNOWN UNFORTUNATELY YEAH THE CENTER OF THE BY WILDFIRES RECENTLY THE KING K. FIRES AND SO JUST ABOUT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HE HAS BEEN RECOVERY AND REBUILDING. I'M AND. WHEN OUR HOUSING AND I WANT TO MAYBE IT'S THE AT THE TABLE HERE TOO LITTLE BIT ABOUT A SPECIFIC. KEY STEP. BRING YOU SPECIFICALLY HOW FEES CAN IMPACT OBJECTS AND HOW THEY CAN FASCICULATION PACK WORKS HOUSING WHICH I THINK WAS TO FOCUS ON HERE SO I'M GONNA BRING UP THIS LATE TO. THIS IS- THIS IS ACTUALLY A CHECK THAT WE BUILT UP IN A- CALL. IN SANTA ROSA IT WAS C. B. HOME. SOLD UP TO PERCENT MY DOWN TO SIX THEN I AM I WE THINK THAT CLOSE IT OUT ABOUT YEARS AGO I'M WE ARE A LITTLE UNUSUAL AS- A HOUSING COMPANY THAT WE BUILD PRIMARY BUSINESS IS A CREDIT PROJECT. MULTI MENTAL. OWNERSHIP PROJECTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO STRUCTURE. NOW. FOR IT YOU NEED TO STOP. AFFORDABLE PRICE AND MARK THIS- STEP MAKING SEVENTY TWO A 100% I'M INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH ONLY FIRST TO AVERAGE FOR THIS WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. HE'S THIRTY FOUR OHMS. WE PRE QUALIFY TO FORTY PEOPLE MEAN THERE WENT TO THE CREDIT CHECKS IN WITH ENDED A LOTTERY AND SHOWS BEFORE WE HAVE BACK UPS IN BACKUPS BEHIND THOSE FOLKS IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DON'T END UP CLOSING SO THE DEMAND OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT BUT IT WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING TESTIMONY SO I JUST TO THE LEVEL IN THE EXTENT OF THE DEMAND. IS THERE. I'M. HERE'S MY LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING IN IN THIS PROJECT. THE STATE OF OFFICE THERE IS. GUARD BUILDERS MACHINE NOT WRITER UP. IS IT IN NAPA THERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FEW THAT WERE DISPLACED BY THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES THINK OF THE SPREE FOR HOMES I THINK. TWELVE ARE ACTUALLY IN MOST AMONG FOREIGN OR THAT WERE HOMES WERE DESTROYED IN THE FIRE THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SERVICES AND TO START FOR THEM I'M EFFECTIVE SALES THIS IS FOR. INDY FIVE TELL FOR THE SAID. MEANING. FOUR WE SET THESE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND- END UP TO FOUR HUNDRED ANYTHING ON THE HIGH END. IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT THEY- A NAP IS UNDER. AND SO THESE ARE WELL WELL WELL BELOW MARKET TO SAY THE LEAST I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL THAT SO TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE LIST AS WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE IN STEP DAD FEES HAVE ON APPROACH LIKE. AS AN IN WAYS THANK YOU. ITS BUDGET SEE THAT WHAT I THINK DOING THAT PEACE PIPE IN PUBLIC SERVICES THERE AFFECTING FOLKS AND THEIR. THE LOWER INCOME LEVELS HIGHER THAN OUR. ARE THE HIGH AND SAID. THROUGH THE PROJECT THAT YOU LOOK AT THE RED GROW BUDGET WHERE CASA WERE COME NINE HAVE BEEN JUST IT OUT ON FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THIS OR THIRTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET BUT. IF OR NO WELL YOU SAID. EVERY STEP WAS FIRST HOME. TYPE OF HOME THIS SPECIFIC SAME MODEL WE HAVE FINISHED IT FIVE YEARS AGO WE DID IN FRONT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SO WE'VE ALREADY SEEN 20% INCREASE IN COSTS OVER- THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW HOW MUCH OF CLASSES TO BUILD THE SOME SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE. SO IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH IN CONSTRUCTION- BUT SOME OF IT IS ALSO BECAUSE OF INCREASED IS ON THIS. SO WE LOOK AT THE SOCKS US ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. THE END PLEASE AND THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT. WELL YOU. TELL THEM THAT. WE REALLY ARE RIGHT AND WE DO NEW PROJECT UP TO THAT END UP. AT LOCAL IMPACT IS THAT WE NEED HELP. I'M AT YOUR EARLIER YOU CAN GO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THAT MARKET AND I'M NOT SURE I WOULD AT THAT AT THAT VALUE BUT I'M REALLY WERE ABOUT. DOLLARS PER HOME IT'S WHAT WE PAY AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WERE ALSO PAYING THE PERMIT FEES THAT YOU CHARGE AT THE COUNTER SO IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WE WERE. KISSING SAYS 70% I AM I DON'T YOUR 20% IN MY THE FEATURE ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO JUST UNDER 10% OF THE COST IS ACTUALLY GO. USE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ARE YOU USED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND SNAP APPS. FIFTY NINE IN THIS NOW. FIFTY THREE HUNDRED. THESE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR PARKS AND RECREATION STREET IMPROVEMENTS UTILITIES FIREARM PARAMEDICS AND WATER TODAY- SO IN A PERMIT FEES ON TOP OF THAT THAT I SHOULDN'T. TOTAL POSSIBLE. PLEASE HOLD THESE SO GOING BACK HERE AGAIN IT'S BASICALLY TODAY PRETTY IT'S OVER TELLING BELOW COST IS THIS ISSUE A DAYS ARE ALL SUBSIDIZED. YEAH THESE ARE ALL SUBSTANCE. THANK UP RESTRICT REGULAR YOUR AGREEMENTS THEY'RE FINISHED. IS WHAT YOU'RE FEES. THAT PUT THAT IN EVERY JURISDICTION THAT WE BUILD EVEN IF WE BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSES IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF THE OUT OF HAVING THE LEGISLATURE IS TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THESE ARE BELOW MARKET IN FACT THIS. PROCESS IS THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO THE WHAT. SUBSIDIZING SO THE GIVING US MONEY. INDEED ASSISTANCE TO BASES DOWN AND THEN IN THEM. IN PART THOSE MONIES IT'S JUST IT'S JUST. IT'S A MESSED UP SYSTEM SAY ITALY'S TO BE. HERE WHICH I THINK I CAN I'M. I MEAN I. MUCH TO ADD EXCEPT THE. GOOD FOLKS THAT ARE IN THIS THESE INCOME ERROR BY. THAT DOLLAR IMPACT WHEN WE ARE PROJECTED OUT OF PASTA MORTGAGE. IT'S GOING TO COME TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ACTIVITY THAT PERSON IS PICKING BACK SO IN SOME WAYS YOU CAN BILL LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY FINANCING THEIR IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS CASE ON THE BACKS OF BLOW IT AT LOW LOW INCOME FOLKS WHO ARE BUYING THESE HOMES SINCE. THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE END. AT THE END OF THE PROJECT IT ALSO. SIR ABILITY TO GET A MORTGAGE. THE ABILITY WE COULD SELL THEM HOMES TEARS WE HAVE TO GO HIGH. YEAH MEDIAN COMES IN ORDER TO REACH FOLKS CAN MORTGAGE INCOME THAT INCLUDE THE. THERE IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. IN HOUSING CALL US. THE PROJECT THAT ARE AS A RESULT OF THE FEES THAT ARE BEING CHOPPED UP OBJECT WHICH WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT MAKING SIXTY THOUSAND HELLO IN THE. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HIT THEM SO. IT MIGHT HAVE ONE PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WORK FOR HOUSING THIS IS WHAT I THINK WE'LL- BE TALKING ABOUT IS EIGHT. 120% I AM UP. SALE WE DO NOT RENTAL PRICE ON THE FOR SALE SIGN WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET SOME KIND OF RELIEF. ABILITY TO LOCAL FEES AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOP LEVEL. SO THAT HAVE ENTERED A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU GUYS VERY. I THOUGHT WE CAN GET THIS THING ABOUT THE SLIDE BEFORE WITH THE. A TRIAL THAT IS PRESS POINT DIFFERENCE. SO ON THE SOFT BECAUSE IT WOULD YOU HAVE COUNT FOR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND OF IT. BUT WHAT WE ESTIMATE. THE COST OF THE SAAB THREE THOUSAND. ANDERSON OF CAR SEAT IN AND CATCH SEQUEL- EXPENSIVE ENTITLEMENT EXPENSE IS YOU KNOW RELATED WE HAD TO DO ANY AYE ARE IN THIS THAT CALIFORNIA THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE SO A LOT OF THAT COMES OUT OF THIS OKAY SO IT WILL. COME PUBLIC CHARGES AND THOSE ARE LIKE CHARGES BUT THOSE ARE REGULATORY RIGHT EXPLAINS YEAH. IS THAT HURDLE TO. RESOLVE THE REGULATORY EXPENSE. SO YEAH THAT HAVE NOT BEEN A HOW TO. THAT SPECIFICALLY BUT I GUESS IS IT. YES TOM ACOSTA HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER UNIT. SO ON A FIVE THOUSAND. IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE LITTLE OVER THE- PRICE OF THE HOME. OKAY THAT HELPS. THOUGHT ABOUT. THE REGULATORY ONES. CASE DO NOT DOING SO BAD BUT IN IN THE- I GET IT AND UNDERSTOOD. IT BY LEYVA MAYES IN SOMEBODY. IN A SEVERE CURRY IN THE NAPA AREA AND SHE'S FANTASTIC WITH. STILL MANY QUESTIONS CAN I GO BACK TO HEY WE CAN JUST START WITH YOU ON. THE. I GUESS DAMAGE GAME THIS ALONE BUT THERE AMERICA GETTING TO THIS. I'VE HEARD LATE FEES OAKLAND IS. DON'T UP TO SEVEN SEVEN. DOESN'T APPLY TO MIDDLE INCOME. THEIR SET BY GEOGRAPHY AND WEAKER MARKET THAT'S WHERE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET WON'T SUPPORT IT SET LOWER. ALSO BEFORE THE HOUSING IS THE EXIT EXAM SO. WHEN HE'S NOT PAYING IMPACT FEES AND I GUESS TELL ME IN YOUR- VIEW DID YOU SEE SIMILAR SORTS OF. DIFFERENTIALS I MEAN I THEY MAKE. THIS AN ICE MASON IS A NEW. FOR ME I DON'T I CAN THINK OF TO ME FEEDBACK ON THE OR- YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY THAT'S VERY MUCH. THIS IS FAIRLY TYPICALLY WHAT WE- THE- BEING A VISIBLE DISABILITY PROCESS AND ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING THE DIFFERENT HOUSING MARKETS WITH IN A JURISDICTION AND THEN ADJUSTING THE FEE RATES WITHIN THE JURISDICTION BASED ON FEASIBILITY CONCERNS- THAT OBVIOUSLY THE BEST PRACTICE BUT IT IS ALSO EXPENSIVE AND TING- AND I THINK. SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY ELEVATE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT WELL HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE TYPICALLY PAYING FEES I THINK THAT OFTEN WE FIND THAT THE- IT'S IMPORTANT. HIM IT WILL BE WHERE BUT OTHER PLEASE. YOU ARE A. IN SORT OF SOME AND WE CAN FIX THIS NOW SWEAR ON THE SQUARE FOOT VERSES IN IT. AND JOHN. THERE'S NOTHING IN STATE LAW ABOUT WHAT THAT DECISION GIVE CHOOSING UNIT OR- RIGHT NOW. IT DOESN'T FIVE. THE KIND OF PRODUCTION AND AS WE TALKED MORE ABOUT DENSITY THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE SOMETHING WE SHOULD GIVE SOME. TO OR AT LEAST. BLAIR IS TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A FOUR SAYS THAT IN INCENTIVIZE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUBS. YEAH. SORT OF YOU KNOW KIND OF SPIDER IS THE KEY THEIR INDICATION SYSTEM IS SITUATIONALLY. YEAH A WAR WHAT BILL MORE UNITS IS THE PART. THE CHARGES. WHAT'S GOING ON FREMONT IN YOUR. I MEAN I SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE- REALLY WERE JUST TRYING TO. SELECT A. I WERE AS IT'S REALLY TO BE NEGATIVE. PROCESS STATE. COUNTIES THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDING PRIOR AND YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY TO SPECIFY OUT FREMONT SPECIFICALLY TO SAY LIKE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE SEEING A WIDE VARIATION IN COSTS TO THAT I SAY THE WORST OF TO AND THAT WAS THE ESSENCE A REGION A JUDGMENT ON THAT BUT THEY THAT THE HIGHEST IT IS. TIED TO THE SAMPLE YOU. LIKE THAT BUT IT'S. AND WITH IT HERE ON THE OTHER END I RECOGNIZE THE. CONSENSUS BUT IT KIND OF THE POINT NEXUS STUDIES MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ARTIST- IT FEELS LIKE OF AN ART THAN A- SCIENCE. I WOULD SAY THE NEXUS EXPERTS WOULD PROBABLY THIS. OFFICIAL I WAS MINISTER AND I HOUSING DIRECTOR YOU GET A BETTER THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT IN THE BUNCH THAT THINKING. WHERE FOOT. POLITICALLY UNTENABLE ANNEX CANADA AND SOLUTIONS TO POLITICAL WRESTLE THAT HAPPENED IT CAME OUT EIGHTY DOLLARS PER FOOT I THINK INDICATES WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF. THESE. YEAH I THINK THERE'S PRETTY ESTABLISH METHODOLOGY ON THE NEXUS STUDY THE ISSUE WHERE HE SAID THAT HE- ACCESS IS GOOD SO YOU. LEGALLY AND THAT YOU CAN ANYWAY. SO WHAT WE DID WAS LOOK WHAT WITH THE MARKLE OUTFIT THE AND THEN SET FEE THERE MANY CITY. THAT AND SO WHERE THEY SAID IT IS JUST BASED. AND COMMUNITY AND. LAYS THANK YOU AND THAT IS A GOOD REFER. BACK TO EUROPE. THIS IS GO ABOVE IN MY RESERVE CITY STEPPING BACK IN CAME BACK A DIFFERENT NUMBER REALLY HAD TO DO MORE ABOUT STAYING WITHIN A BAND THE POSTED AN ARBITRARY. EVER BUT SORT OF SPEAKING TO I MEAN. AFRICA HAS ALWAYS FRIEDMAN IS GAME TO EARLIER ABOUT ANY ZONING IN HER CITY. IT'S LIKE. COULD BE ABILITY TO TRY TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT. TO THAT THERE ARE A OUR SERVICE ACCEPTED PRACTICES WITH THIS EARN BUT THE VERY IS PRETTY. DOUBLE TO ME TO HAVE THE WHOLE TIME PLEASE FIVE INPUT ON THE BACKS OF. MOTORS AND AN END TO OUR RENT- I DON'T OF HIS WEIGHT AND PUTS PORK- GUARDRAILS AROUND THAT TO NOT HAVE SIX AT. THE EIGHT. BE ON THE GEOGRAPHIC AND- AND WAGED PROBABLY DIFFERENT. MAYBE I DON'T. OWN THE LAND QUESTION. DID THE VARIATION FEELS. THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED A LOT OF REGIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPACT I THINK YOU YOUR VARIETY OF OPINIONS. YOU WOULD ALSO. GET THEIR FROM CERTAIN CITIES AND SPITTING SPECIAL DISTRICTS. SO DEPENDENT ON FEES THAT THEY DELIVER THE SIR. IN OPEN IT'S DIFFERENT- FEES ARE REALLY SMALL OF OUR REVENUE. DESIGN NOT PROHIBIT SO. YOU CAN THAT WAY BUT YOU CERTAINLY THE NUMBER OF BOOKS THE CHALLENGE OF ANY KIND OF GUARDRAIL A CONSTRAINT ON FEET BUT I THINK IF WE COULD FIT A DIFFERENT WAY TO FIX OUR AND IT REALLY COMES OUR- OFFICE DOES AGE OF LEBANESE AND HAPPY. ALLOW GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE. SO THAT WE CAN FIX THOSE OTHER. ELEMENTS THEN WE CAN LINE UP ON FEES YEAH. I'M. THE FEE THAT YOU SPOKE OUT IN THERE YES. IS SIMPLY HOUSING FEE IT'S NOT THE IT'S NOT THE WHOLE IF YOU LIKE SCHOOL FIGURES TO MAKE THAT. THAT'S RIGHT SO I WAS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING TO DEVELOP AN IMPACT THE CITY. AND SO WE FOR A HOUSING IMPACT FEE THAT. V. AND THEN A CAL FACILITIES FREE OKAY THERE ARE OTHER FEET. IS THERE'S DE. YEAH EACH IS FROM OTHER DISTRICTS- OTHER CHARGE IN THAT IS SO THOSE ARE A IN WITH THE GRAPHIC DIFFERENT BILL. VISINE NOTED THAT APPLIES TO THOSE OTHER ONES. YOU JUST THAT'S RIGHT THOSE PERCENT BY THESE AND DID NOT. BUT WE DID. THE ANALYSIS LOOK AT A COME PROJECT PRO FORM THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. PLEASE AND. LARRY THE. YOU WERE YOU MADE IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT JUST A PART OF A POINT ON IT. WHEN YOU ABOUT THE FREE MONTH. YOU WOULDN'T GO THERE RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T TAKE YOUR PRODUCT THERE YOU WOULDN'T MAKE AN EFFORT THERE YOU JUST USE OF THESE REALLY DETERMINE WHERE YOU GO AND VOTER SHERMAN IMPACT ON WHAT WE BUILT UP. WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUILD ON WITH THOSE. PRODUCT OR TALKING ABOUT HERE IT IS WITH THIS CITY. THE WAY ANYTHING WE. I DO DIAL IT IS A BOX YEAH IT'S ESSENTIALLY A DUPLEX THERE'S- THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED ROOF. HI ABILITY TO SELL THEIR SEPARATE BUILDINGS BUT TECHNICALLY THE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THAT WAS A NEW FOR ME AND- I WAS A NEW WAY TO ADVANCE. TO SAY. THANK YOU BYE. WHAT KINDS IN USE THESE DAYS AND I'LL BE HERE FOR THE LINK OUT. I GUESS I ONE MORE QUESTION. WE DON'T HAVE A MARKER REDEVELOP HERE YOU KNOW WHO SORT OF CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MAYBE YOU KNOW OR JERRY WHEN YOU DID YOUR STYLE. BUT YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. WHEN YOU TURN ANY KIND OF FEE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE IT SOME MORE SOMEONE HAS TO GIVE. AND GIVEN THE HIGH COST OF CONSTRUCTION PLANS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ARE YOU. SAN FRANCISCO OR OR. ARE YOU LOOKING AT- THE IMPACT THAT. THE. BUT YOU'RE- MORE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING IS ON THE RENTS OF MARKET RATE PRODUCTION IN OTHER WORDS OTHER DEVELOPERS AT ALL TO JUST OBSERVE ARE THERE LIKE HEY WE HAVE TO PAY THIS FEE THAT'S GOING TO GO FOR A HOUSING AND WE JUST NEED AT ALL OR THEY RAISING THEIR RENTS OUT THEIR NEW THINGS TO PAY FOR IT AND IF SO TO JUST CRUISE CONTINUING. THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE AREN'T. YOU KNOW TO GET YOUR SUBSIDY AREN'T WHAT. WAY MORE PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY THAN THEY EVER GET LOTTERY TO GET ONE OF THESE UNITS. YOU ALSO TO INCREASE. THAT'S GOING ON YOUR BILL CLASS. I RENTER'S I DOING THIS OR YOU'RE NOT SEEING A CHANGE. YES NO MATTER. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU FEED EITHER GONNA WRITE COST PRODUCT THIS CASE YOU CAN'T REYES WHAT PEOPLE MORE THAN A PEOPLE OF EIGHTY FOUR ONE HEY SO YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I'M GONNA PASS THIS ON TO THE TUMOR OKAY BECAUSE THIRTY SEVEN THE WILLING HEY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR YOUR PROP. WHAT IS OUT OF THE VALUE OF THE LAND. AND. GET MUCH OF IT COMES OUT OF PROFIT WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE DEVELOPMENT. MOMENT THIS IS PART OF ELEMENT YOU DON'T YOU THINK IN OAKLAND IT'S NOT RAISING RENTS WHAT ABOUT AN AREA THAT'S A NOT AS HOT HOUSING IN YOUR- YOU KNOW. THIS IS PRETTY UNIQUE IT'S AN EXTREMELY HOT HOUSING MARKET. VIEW WITH DOWN ON LOS ANGELES BEVERLY HILLS I WORRY. THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN. BURBANK. SO THERE IS A BIG RANGE OF VALUES IN OAKLAND SO EAST OAK AND OUR OUR WEAKEST REAL ESTATE MARKET THAT'S WHY THE FEE WAS SET AT ZERO. SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DEPENDS SENATE ZERO WHAT HAPPENED. WELL WE'RE GETTING VERY LITTLE MARKET DEVELOPMENT THERE. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO SEE LACK OF DEVELOPMENT THERE. YEAH I THINK IT THREE THAT. IS SUPPOSED TO WORK BUT IT HASN'T IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME SAID. DID IT SHOULD FLOW TO THE LAMB. GO DOWN IN PRICE AS A RESULT OF INCREASED CALL US. UNFORTUNATELY I AND AS IN ALL THE CAN OCCUR THE NEW LANDFILLS SO THEY SAY AND SO. GOING ON TO THEIR POWER TING ON THE LAND SIDE AND SO IT'S NOT REFLECTING THE WAY THAT THE MARKET SHOULD WORK AND SO THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT BACK. THE PRIEST CASA BY CREATING YOUR MUSIC TO INCREASE SOME AS HIGH AS YOU CAN GET IN THE MARKET THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE SAYS INCREASE INCREASE FRANCE. AND IF I MAY JUST ADD ON THAT POINT- I THINK IN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY SPECIFIC UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE LANDOWNERS ARE NOT SEEING THEIR PROPERTY TAX INCREASE THE RATE THAT WE ARE SEEING THE VALUES. THANKS FOR THEIR STATE. CENTER FOR AND- LAND. THANK YOU. IN A LAST CHANCE FOR MANY THE PANEL I'M ALSO A KIND OF REMINDER THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS AFTER HIS ABOUT INTAKE IDEAS TENSION. STATION CAN OVERSIGHT MATTERS YOU KNOW IN FOR ITEMS BEFORE A COMMITTEES GOING FOR. CERTAIN OPEN ENDED HIGHLY BUT POINTED THAT SOMETIMES THE VALUE THESE COMMITTEES ANY ANY FINAL CONTACTS FOR THE COMMITTEE. I'M NOT GONNA JUST USES AN OPPORTUNITY I MEAN YOU YOU SORT OF HIT ON AT THE IMPACT WAS ONLY A- PERCENTAGE OF THE COST. I MEAN WE'RE SPENDING PRADA THIRD OF THE COST OF OUR DEVELOPMENT IS JUST ENTITLEMENTS BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT NORMALIZE THE PROCESS OR START TO RATIONALIZE THE PROCESS EVEN IN TERMS OF ENTITLEMENTS. WILL HAVE A HUGE HUGE IMPACT IT'S GOING TO BE IN DEVELOPMENT I WAS A PRIME. ON OUR OPERATE INS INSTEAD OF JUST GO FOR ALL. THERE IS SIR. TO CREATE A- THAT DETERMINE FIVE THEY HAVE A PROJECT IN SOME YOU KNOW IT GOING IN AND NO YEAH THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS A SIMPLE AND HOW LONG IT'S GONNA TAKE IS POOR AND SO AND- YOU CAN DO TO NORMALIZE.

BE ON THE MARKET WON'T PRODUCE YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABLE. TIRED AS ANY SO WE'VE CREATED THIS SYSTEM. THAT WE'RE SEEING MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING GROUP. USED TEST REDRAWING UNITS ALTHOUGH THE MARKET ISN'T REALLY PRODUCING THOSE BECAUSE INVESTORS ARE PRODUCING THEM FAMILIES ARE PRODUCED I'M SO GETTING YOU. FUTURE INVEST FOR CHANGING. STANCE AND THEN- SOME CASES SOMETHING GIVE EITHER YOU HAVE TO HAVE A YOU KNOW A ROUTE AND PROPERTY TAX REDUCTION IN A LAND COST TO IN IN THE STATE HAS BEQUEATHED. INOTES NONPROFIT UPPER OR. IN OKAY ELIMINATED MOST OF OUR PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE BUT ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY PARKING IS A HUGE EXPENSE SOME US HAS TO GIVE SO I. STATE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THOSE COST. MUCH EASIER. TO TACKLE THEM. BUT IT'S THAT THE WHOLE PICTURE. THE HELPFUL LATE CAN I JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT. WHAT ARE YOUR REACTIONS TO THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE HAVEN'T SEEN I MEAN I SAY THIS BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S WELL INTENTIONED WE SEEN AN ACTOR AT ALL IMPROPER AS I HAVE TO KIND OF LAUGH IN WAYS I'M- SORRY SARCASTICALLY I'M AND BECAUSE DEALING WITH THE WILD FIRES WE THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT DEMOCRATS. DOING ACTUALLY IN SANTA ROSA RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO FIRE VICTIMS AND WE CAN USE THOSE THOSE VISIONS BEFORE THE AS WITH THIS WAS GONNA LEVIN MONTH ANTI PROCESS. LEGISLATION.

COMPLAIN TO I'M JUST NOT SAYING. I GET IT IS SET ON IT IN THE SENSE. AN EMERGENCY MEASURE IS FOR A MINUTE PERIOD. AND THAT SERVICE IS WHAT YOU WERE SAYING A MOMENT AGO WANTING THAT CERTAINTY PROCESS I THINK IN SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE TRIED. IT AGAIN. AUTHOR IS AN AMAZING. THIS IS THE RECOGNITION WAS POLITICALLY POSSIBLE POINT TIME AND YOU KNOW IT BACK TO THAT OVERSIGHT OBSERVATION IF WE. SEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY WORKED OUT PRETTY GOOD THE CITIES ARE ADOPTED INTO IN TAKING THE ECSTATIC COMPONENT OF REVIEW THE VIEW TO HEART SEE MAKE IT HAPPEN THAT WOULD BE WORTHY OF CERTAINLY EXTENT BUT MAYBE SOME SORT OF OPINION IN LAW WE REALLY CAN I. CAN LOOK AT THE STATE. AND DON'T YOU. PROP WE WERE JUST STARTING TO AND THOMAS AND I WILL HELP YOU KEEP YOUR OF. ARMED IF THAT WE- THE PROCESSES RESULT I WOULD LOVE FEEDBACK- GOOD OTHER REASON THIS PAN- I WILL TO. OPEN THE FLOOR. I'M OVER HERE IN ONE REYES. PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT IT ALL MENTION. KNOWLEDGE AND THAT COMMON CAUSE AFTERNOON WHY NOT I MEAN WITH. BUT YOU'RE IS FOR A- TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS KAREN I CAST I AM- REGIONAL ORGANIZING FOR CALIFORNIA MD YES IN MY BACKYARD ONE THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND COMMUTING IT'S REALLY CRITICAL STOCKTON. AND JOINING US IN AN AREA WHERE WE SEE. ONE OF THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING AS AS EXPRESSED IN A REALLY STRONG WAY WHICH IS THE CHALLENGES SPECIFICALLY THAT WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE HAVE FORTY HOUSING- I THINK ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE IS A CRISIS OF. AFFORDABILITY FOR PEOPLE IN EXTREME POVERTY. THAT'S ONE OF THE PAGES VISION PROPERTIES IS VERY BUT BEFORE ANYTHING. HOUSING VERY MUCH INCLUDED- BUT I GREW UP. AND IN IOWA. SOME OF THE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE INCOME IN THIS AREA WOULD. HI INCOME WHERE I GREW UP- ARE ABLE TO DOESN'T I IN A WAY THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN THE BAY AREA AND CALIFORNIA. I THINK INCREASING THE STATE IS LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE I THINK A LOT ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE LIVED IN SOUTH BERKELEY AND NORTH OAKLAND. INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF HOUSING TYPES. IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THERE ARE SIX HOMES IN THERE ARE COMPLEX IS IN THERE ARE SMALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS THEIR MID SIZE OF THE BILL. HI THAT'S WHAT IT IS WHAT A GREAT DIVERSITY OF RESIDENTS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE DIVERSE AND RACE AND AGE AND GENDER PRESENTATION AND OCCUPATION AND NATIONALITY. ARE BUT MOST OF THE BUILDINGS IN THE HOODS WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO BUILD TODAY. PLEASE I HAVE LIVED IN. ILLEGAL TO BILL TODAY I HOPE FOR THE. IN BERKELEY I A PROVIDE TWENTY HAS TWICE AS MANY AS ARE CURRENTS OWNING DEFICIT RIDLEY SAYING IN THE LAND USE POLICY WE MADE A MISTAKE WILL OUT TOO MANY HOMES TO BE BUILT HERE THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE LIVING- THE HERE AND- WE'RE NOT LET LET THE MISTAKES HAPPEN AGAIN. IT DOESN'T RUN OF OUR STREET PARKING- IT'S WITHIN THE HIGHLANDS I'M SURE IT'S VIOLATING SETBACKS UNLOCK COVERAGE. AND THESE ARE ALL SORT OF THE STATE EVEN IN A RELATIVELY PRO HOW. XIN MOST OF THE CONSTRUCTION THAT ICE HE IS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING RENOVATION. RATHER THAN NEW MULTI FAMILY HOUSING THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED BEING. I SO. I THINK BLAH BLAH INTERNET IS TO THE TELL ALL MY GRANDFATHER TO BUY A HOME IN BERKELEY AS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY THERE I DON'T THINK A PROFESSOR THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO AGAIN TO. NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE BARRIERS- HAD A CALM A LOT BECAUSE. HUNDRED PROGRAM IS THE IS. YEAH THEY JUST LINE ON A MAP AND THOSE COMMUNITIES FACING THE SAME. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. I'M THE DIRECTOR WITH DOES NOT FIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION BY THEMSELVES YEAH SO FIRST AS LIKE YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING HEARING HERE. IT'S AN ORGANIZATION. OUR TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED THE HOUSE FOR THE LOWEST INCOME IN THE BAY AREA BUT- WHICH- ARE HOUSING FOR THE MISSING MIDDLE AND A TREND THAT WE HAVE BEEN OBSERVING STATE LEVEL HAS BEEN AT THAT LOCATION SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIES. ARE MISSING MEN HOW OLD WHICH WE THINK YEAH. ARE ANY. BUT COMPARED TO THE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS WHERE- WITHOUT THE SUBSIDY IS THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY PROVIDES THEY WOULD HAVE A HOMES AT ALL WOULD BE HOMELESS WE THINK THAT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS FOR MISSING MIDDLE COULD BE ADDRESSED. THROUGH ZONING REFORM. SHOULDN'T WE HAVE TO EARN FOUR WE GET TO THE DIRECT SUBSIDIES THOUGH THERE IS ALSO A ROLE TO PLAY WITH DIRECT SUBSIDIES WITHIN THE HIGH COST OF THE STATE BUT FRANKLY MOST OF CALIFORNIA ISN'T YET IN AS EXTREMIST SITUATION AS THE BAY AREA BUT EVEN HERE WE- CAN DO A LOT MORE. ZONING REFORM TO LOOK IMPACT FEES AND SAYING. WE CAN STRUCTURE THESE. MRS WITHOUT. ME EASIER S. AS IN OR GET XIN WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THESE SO SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE REALLY BELIEVE IN RESERVING THE SUBS. DOES. TOM I'LL MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE MARKET PROVIDE HOMES OF FOR THE FOR THE LITTLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WE WRAP UP THE MAIN PARTING COMMENTS FOR. THE HEARING TODAY. GLORIA FOR HAVING. THIS HEARING BUT WE HAD NOW A COUPLE HEARINGS AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY VALUABLE- YOU DO SEE THEM IN THE LEGISLATURE ALL RIGHT UP TO HER TO TACKLE A LOT OF ISSUES. AND IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE WE- A LOT. ONLY FILL IN FIGHTING WITH OUR OWN LOCALITY. SITUATIONS AND TRYING TO BE MINDFUL DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND DIFFERENT. AT ALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN OUR STATE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTION SETTING UP A ZONING LAWS THAT HAVE- NEEDED TO WEAR FOR A LOT ARE RED. IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN OUR- AND. NOW WE KNOW HAVE THIS HUGE CRISIS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S HOLDING US BACK KLAY AND CAUSING BE LIVING UP. AND I PUT WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE A POSSIBILITY TAKEN. IF IT MAKES A SOME POP. I JUST WISH. I GUESS THAT MORE PEOPLE SAW THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR OWN ON WILDERNESS TO SO MUCH HOW TO LIVE A LITTLE BIT AND MAKING ROOM FOR EVERYONE AND I ALSO WE- ARE JOB. WITH THE DEMOCRATS READING REALLY GOOD. HOLDEN I. WAS I THINK THEIR JOB WITH THE BEAR. MORE THAN A- BUT YOU KNOW DANCE USUALLY HAS CUT THE COST OF OUR COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN ADDING TO COMMUNITIES I THINK MAYBE GOES BACK TO A LITTLE ABOUT THE LACK OF ABILITY TO CREATE A VARIETY OF HOUSING STYLE AND DOING IT IN PLACES WHAT MAKES IT INTO FOR PEOPLE TO BE TO LIVE. AND WORK ALL AREA I. WATER RESISTANCE BECAUSE OF DENSE WE'VE DONE TEN. OFF CHANGE BUT I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE PARTY EQUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S AN UPGRADE TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD I'M NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I WISH I COULD TAKE THEM OUT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND- OAKLAND BERKELEY. AND SHOW THEM HOW. THIS TO BE IN A PLACE THAT. NO MORE JOHNSON HOW YOU STILL HAVE SIMPLY DOWN. AT. FOR US HE CITY STREETS IN A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND A HEALTHIER.

TEACHER AND IS ANYONE SACRAMENTO NO THAT THAT'S HOW ARE THEY DOING ABOUT IT. AND THAT THE MULTIPLE YEARS IS COMMITTEES BEEN AROUND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE. A PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTERNET LAW- SOME THAT REQUIRE OVERSIGHT A FOLLOW UP TO SEE A JURISDICTION BUT IMPLEMENTING. IN SUMMER PILOT PROGRAMS NEED TO BE EXPANDED THE POINT IS THAT THESE HEARINGS. ACROSS THE STATE I THINK A VERY HELP. A FOR TRYING TO GET. THREE MINS POINT ABOUT WHAT PRODUCTION ADDITIONAL SUPPLY LOOK LIKE. LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS THEY WORK TO THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE DONE. THIS LAST CONVERSATION. THIS FRIEDMAN TALKS ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHICH IS IMPORTANT I RECOGNIZE- NOBODY WANTS IN AN UGLY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD I GET IT SOME OF THE CITY OFF TO SAY THAT WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE HOUSING TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMES BACK AND YOU ARE QUITE POINTED AT THE CHICKEN A CONVERSATION. YOU HAVE TO KIND OF GET AHEAD. MORE SPECIFICALLY. WHAT ABOUT THE BY SAYING THAT THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE. IS INTENDED TO BE EXCLUSIVE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE.
