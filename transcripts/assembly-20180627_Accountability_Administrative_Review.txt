ALRIGHT WE DO HAVE A QUORUM -- I IT WOULD BE -- TIE ME FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE A MOVE ON THE CONSENT AGENDA PEOPLE ARE SO INCLINED. SECOND IT'S BEEN MOVED BY MISTER PATTERSON SECOND BY MISTER LACKEY SECRETARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THE CONSENT ITEMS. THAT WOULD BE SB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO BY PAN THAT WOULD BE L. S. BEAT FIFTEEN OH FIVE BY. A THE THE KEY GEO COMMITTEE AND S. B. FIFTEEN OWN NINE THE GOVERNOR AND FINANCE COMMITTEE BILL. THE MOTION IS. DO PASS AND REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BUT A MONTH AS EGGMAN BELLOMONT THIS EGGMAN AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE BURKE [inaudible] FRAZIER [inaudible] LACKING LACKEY AYE MEDINA QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. ITEM IS PASSED -- WOULD COHEN A SENATORS WE ARE LOOKING FOR CENTERS SKINNER. LARA AND GLAZER COME TO PRESENT WELCOME SENATOR SKINNER. THANKS SO MUCH SHARON MEMBERS OKAY SO TODAY BEFORE AS YOU ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTING SP. NINE EIGHTY FOUR CORRECT THANKS SO MUCH SO. NINE EIGHTY FOUR IN THIS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE WE'RE MY THINK INC GROWING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT WHILE WE HAVE WORK TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS THAT WE STILL HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS SOME WHAT THEY REFER TO AS CLASS THE CEILING I WOULD JUST SAY BARRIERS. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR PRIVATE SECTOR CEOS. COMPOSITION OF BOARDS AND WE EVEN LOOK AT THEIR MEMBERSHIP FOR LEGISLATURE WE STILL DON'T HAVE. A FEMALE REPRESENTATION THAT'S ANYWHERE NEAR. OR PORTION OF THE POPULATION NOW. ONE COULD DEBATE WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE -- REPRESENTATION EXACTLY PROPORTIONATE TO POPULATION AND THAT IS A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE DEBATE BUT CERTAINLY WHEN WOMEN MAKE UP 51% OF OUR POPULATION AND YET WERE -- IT IN CORPORATE ENTITIES TO NO LESS THAN 4% OR SO IN THE LEGISLATURE 20% ARE UNDER. THEN YOU CAN SAY THERE'S YOU WE NEED SOME CORRECTIONS SO THE POINT OF MY BILL IS TO HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUDDEN EXAMPLE AND BE A LEADER IN THIS QUEST. AND THROUGH THAT TOO BOTH OPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN BUT ALSO TO HOPEFULLY SEND A MESSAGE TO PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR. THAT WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE A RIGHT TO HAVE A STRONGER REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN. SO WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE APPOINTMENTS THAT WHERE EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS THAT MEMBERSHIP. AND SO WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST APPOINTED BOARDS. OUR WOMEN -- AND THAT IS ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE MOVING AND IT'S WE HAVE SOME TIME. AND THAT IF THERE IF THE BOARD IS SMALL SO EXACT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S ONLY A FIVE MEMBERSHIP BOARD THAN A MINIMUM OF TWO WOMEN IF IT'S ONLY FOR MEMBERSHIP BOARD A MINIMUM OF ONE WOMAN. SO THAT'S THE WHAT THE BILL DOES THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF IT AND IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF RECOGNIZES THAT GENDER IS NOT A FIXED CONCEPT AND SO IT ALLOWS. FOR SELF DEFINITION OF ONE'S GENDER. AND WITH THAT I'LL ASK MY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT TO SPEAK. FIRST PERSONS BECAUSE SUPPORT PLEASE. THAT MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PAUL GOT BACK I AM THE FOUNDER WOMEN SERVE ON BOARDS. A MOMENT THAT ENCOURAGES FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO BUILD LIVERS BOARDS THAT OCCLUDE WOMEN. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. A QUOTE RIGHTS ADVOCATES I HAVE WRITTEN THE BOOK AND REGULAR THEIR SPEAK RIGHT AND TRAINED PROFESSIONALS ABOUT BOARD SERVICES. GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR BROWN HAS RECENTLY APPOINTED ME TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION. LET ME JUST BECAUSE THE BENEFITS FOR WOMEN TO SERVE ON GOVERNMENT BOARDS TO GIVE THEM LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MAKES HIS BILL VERY IMPORTANT. ONE GOVERNMENT SERVICE OFTEN GARNISHED PUBLIC VISIBILITY AND MAY PROVIDE RECOGNITION FOR OUTSTANDING SERVICES ON THE JOB. TOO MANYGOVERNMENT BOARDS TOUCH SUBSTANTIVE AREAS OF LAW BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY AND THAT'S PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN NEW SUBSTANTIVE AND LEADERSHIP SKILLS. THREE OVERSEEING THIS AGENCIES. AND PROJECTS CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH RESPONSIBILITIES SUCH AS INCREASED LEADERSHIP BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS. FOR SERVICE ON GOVERNMENT BOARDS HELPS TO BUILD A REPUTATION OF INTEGRITY AND ETHICS BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT BOARDS ALL ARE ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. FINALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT MINORITY BUT TALKING ABOUT 50% OF THE POPULATION THIS IS WHY THE COMPOSITION OF EACH APPOINT AU OF WHAT A BOARD AND COMMISSION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA. IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD GENDER PARITY [inaudible] IN CONCLUSION -- I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS STATISTICS FROM UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE KNOWN AS GO. IT WILL TAKE ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO TO REACH PARITY IN THE UNITED STATES ON CORPORATE BOARDS SO LET ME PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE I'M. THIRTY SIX IN FORTY YEARS OLD THE SEVENTY SIX IN A HUNDRED YEARS I WILL BE. A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER IS SIX YEARS OLD. FORTY YEARS YOU'LL BE FORTY SIX IN THE HUNDRED SHE WILL BE OVER A HUNDRED SO THE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. WOMEN NOT REACH PARITY IN MY LIFETIME IN HER LIFETIME AND AND AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. THIS BILL IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DELUDE BY EXAMPLE AND SHOW THAT THE REST OF THE NATION. WORLD AND CORPORATE AMERICA HOW INCLUSION IS DONE RIGHT AND HOW THAT IS MORE IMPORTANTLY DONE IN OUR LIFETIME. FOR THIS REASON WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AS BEING NINE EIGHT FOUR AND FOR EACH YEAR I WILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT NEXT SUPPORTER IF YOU COULD JUST BE BRIEF THIS DOES ENJOY MY RECOMMENDATION. OKAY GREAT I HAD A GOOD MORNING AUDIBLE CHAIRPERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TONY SAYS SOME OF CURRENT FELLOW WITH THE WOMEN'S POLICY IS A TO THROUGH THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION. AN ALUM OF THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON ONE KNEE -- AS BE NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER WITH A BRIEF WORDS OF THE ONE OF THE FIERCEST WOMEN THAT I KNOW A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG. SHE STATES WOMEN WILL HAVE ACHIEVED TRUE EQUALITY WHEN MEN SHARE WITH THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BRINGING UP THE NEXT GENERATION. ASHIS COOPERATE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IT'S INFLAMING THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A WITH ALL THE ADVANCES THAT WE HAVE MADE FOR WOMEN THAT THIS FIGHT CONTINUES. ARE KENTUCKY I MEAN NOT CONNECTICUT FLORIDA AND KENTUCKY MISSOURI NORTH CAROLINA AND MANY OTHERS I GENERALLY REQUIRE APPOINTING BOARDS TO HAVE -- DIVERSITY BUT ALSO THE INCLUDE GENDER EQUITY HAS BEEN NINETY FOUR WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA OF THE MODEL FOR GENDER EQUITY -- THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. AS A LATINA DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT IMMIGRANTS AND POLICY ADVOCATE MY DREAM IS TO BE A PART OF SHAPING CALIFORNIA A LEGISLATION AND STATE GOALS BY ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE SEATS ON APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THE STATE IS COMMITTING A TO FORMALIZING MUCH NEEDED GENDER EQUITY WITHIN OUR STATE. WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR SEATS FOR THEM AT THE TABLE AND IF THEY WORK HARD ENOUGH THEY CAN GET THERE AND BE A PART OF SHAPING THE STATE'S LANDSCAPE. I WILL END WITH THE WORDS OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER CHEN HAS GINSBURG ON THE IMPORTANCE OF POWERFUL WOMEN -- IN MALE DOMINATED SPACES. YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE THINGS YOU HAVE. IF YOU GONNA CHANGE THINGS YOU HAVE TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD THE LEVER. THE WIND THE WPI HAS TRAINED OVER FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY CISGENDER TRANSGENDER WOMEN AND NON CONFORMING INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S FIFTEEN YEARS ALREADY TO TAKE THAT LEVER. OF POLICY MAKING. WE DESERVE SEATS AT THE TABLE WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT A COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ONCE AGAIN I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BE NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER. AND HELP MAKE CALIFORNIA A MODEL OF GENDER EQUITY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. JOHN MICHAEL FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA AT WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE WERE HAPPY TO WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURE THAT TRANSGENDER WOMEN ARE REFLECTED IN THEIR SERVICE ON CORPORATE BOARDS.

IT'S QUIRK SILVA. WELL GOOD MORNING TO OUR SENATOR AND RIGHT AWAY I DO. REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL ON WOULD ASK TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED. THE W. MOTION THING. YES. I DON'T SECOND. I'M NOT SURE FOR TWO HOUSES ALLOWED JOINT AUTHORED BUT THEY CERTAINLY ALLOW CO AUTHOR OKAY SO WHAT. BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK BECAUSE AS WE REALLY LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE. INVOLVED IN THEIR TIME REALLY PROFESSIONS IT'S A SO MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH OPPORTUNITIES AND I KNOW ALMOST SIXTEEN YEARS AGO I AS MY PROFESSION I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER. BUT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY TO BE AS A COMMISSIONER ON IN MY LOCAL CITY. AND HAD TO GO THROUGH VARIOUS INTERVIEWS AND WAS. SELECTED TO BE ON THE PARKS AND RECREATION SO TO BE HONEST THAT WAS THE VERY BEGINNING OF UP KIND OF STEPPING INTO -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND RECREATION COMMISSION AND THEN ALSO GOING TO COUNSEL MANY TIMES THAT WAS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE ROOM I'M NOT ONLY WITH JUST -- COUNCIL MEMBERS BUT ALSO WITH CITY MANAGERS AND ALL THAT AND DEPARTMENT HEADS MANY TIMES IT WAS MYSELF MAYBE ONE OTHER ONE WOMAN. AND I THINK THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING BUT WE HAVE TO BE DIRECT ABOUT THAT CHANGE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE NOTICE THOSE CHANGES BECAUSE OF IT. WOMEN ARE GETTING MORE ENGAGED IN ACTIVE BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO SO I APPRECIATE THIS AND SUPPORT THIS BILL. ENQUEUE. IF YOU MEASURE WHICH SPEAK. OKAY BUT YOU ALSO SEE I THIS I TH I THINK WE'VE BEATEN I THINK YOU HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT APPROACH THAT WILL BEGIN LEADING BY EXAMPLE WITHIN OUR OWN PURVIEW. TO PUT TO THE STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I RECENTLY HAD A CONSTITUENT COME TO ME WHO FELT LIKE SHE WAS BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ABOUT GETTING HIRED UP IN A TRADITIONALLY MALE ORIENTED FIELD. I HAD GONE GOT ADDITIONAL THAT CERTIFICATES AT IT THAN ANY OTHER MALE APPLYING HAD -- ALONE I KINDA LOOKED INTO LOOKING THE BOARD THAT THAT OVERSAW THAT INTO CORPORATION. ALL MALE BOARD SO WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES DOES THINGS HAVE REPERCUSSIONS WHEN WE LOOK AT PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO EVEN START COMING UP THE LADDER. LEADERSHIP REALLY MATTERS -- SO I AM OFF I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL BAH AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE ALSO KNOW THAT MUCH OF OUR AT THE OPPORTUNITIES COME FROM RELATIONSHIPS. AND SO BY -- EXPANDING MORE WOMEN ON SUCH OPPORTUNITIES THEY DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN ASSIST THEM GET INTO OTHER POSITIONS SO WITHOUT ASKING RIGHT VOTE. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. ELEMENT THIS EGGMAN BY THAT AMOUNT THIS EGGMAN AYE PATTERSON. PATTERSON NOT VOTING BURKE FRAZIER [inaudible] LACKING [inaudible] LACKEY I MEDINA [inaudible] QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. WILL HOLD THAT ROLE OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS SO MUCH CENTER GLAZER. MORNING SENATOR HOME YOU ARE HERE TO STAY TO PRESENT S. B.. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN AND MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- THEN YOUR STAFF OF COURSE. THAT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU WOULD AUTHORIZE THAT DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF A PROPOSED EXPANSION OF AN OFF HIGHWAY MOTOR VEHICLE PARKED THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT. THIS EXPANSION IS KNOWN AS THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION. AND ITS ADJACENT TO THIS EXISTING PARK THAT WE REFER TO AS CARNEGIE. IT'S BEEN THERE FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS SO. HEAR ABOUT THE EIGHT THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKS IN CALIFORNIA NOT ENOUGH. I FOR THOSE WHO I PRACTICE THAT ACTIVITY BUT ONE OF THEM'S IN MY DISTRICT TEN VERY MUCH ENJOYED. UP BY THOSE WHO I DO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ACTIVITY. IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE DEPARTMENT OVER SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS PURCHASE THIS ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION. FOR AROUND NINE MILLION DOLLARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THIS EXPANSION PROJECT HAS BEEN MIRED IN CONTROVERSY I EVER SINCE -- BOTH THE ASSEMBLY WILL BEEN BAKER -- AND AYE AYE SHE IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO AT THIS PROPERTY SITS AND TO HAVE BOTH THAT I TRY DO OBSERVE CAREFULLY THE PLAYERS INVOLVED IN THIS CONTROVERSY WE'VE BOTH GONE OUT. TO THE SITE TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. BOTH IN THE EXISTING SITE IN THE PROPOSED EXPANSION TALKED ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO CONSTRUCTIVELY HELP. IN THIS DILEMMA OF THIS EXPANSION AREA. AND THAT THE PARTIES ARE PRETTY WELL -- SAID IN THEIR VIEWS ABOUT IT AND THAT -- THAT THE BEST THING THAT WE COME UP WITH AS A CONSTRUCTIVE STEP FORWARD ALTHOUGH ARGUABLY A SMALL. ONE IT'S TOO IF AT SOME POINT IN THE IN THIS PROCESS I THE DEPARTMENT DECIDES THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY GOING TO LEAD TO EXPANDING THIS PAR -- THAT THE IS THERE AN OPTION FOR THEM TO DISPOSE OF THE LAND APPROPRIATELY GET THAT MONEY BACK INTO THE OFF ROAD FUND AND TRY TO FIND ANOTHER PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT. CAN BE AT CONSTRUCTED FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY THIS ACTIVITY. AND SO IT WAS OUT OF THAT WORK THAT THIS BILL IS BEFORE YOU THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING. IT IS NOT SPEAK TO THE ACTIVITY OF OFF ROAD RIDING IT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE CURRENT OFF -- HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKED THAT I I MENTION. IT SIMPLY GIVES THE PARKS DEPARTMENT THE OPTION TO SELL THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION AREA IF THEY DECIDE. IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST AND THEN TO RETURN THE MONEY TO THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE FROM FUND FROM WHICH IT ORIGINATED. I THE ONLY CONDITION IS THAT THIS LAND. IF IT ISN'T -- IT THE DECISION IS TO NOT DEVELOP IT WOULD BE PERMANENTLY PRESERVE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES. I THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE LOCAL AND STATEWIDE PRESERVATION NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS SIX LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND FOR THESE REASONS THAT WOULD ASK FOR YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION TODAY. AND WITH ME ACTUALLY IS TO BE JOINED BY TERESA COOK REPRESENTS THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND BET THAT WUERZBURG PRESIDENT THE EAST BAY CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANTS. SOCIETY CHAPTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR IN THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST PERSON SPEAKING IN SUPPORT PLAINTIFFS IN AN ADVISER. GOOD MORNING CHAIR ADDS READING TO COOK ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PARTICIPER FRASER IS VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT OF THIRTEEN SIXTEEN S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN OFFERS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR THE ALAMEDA TUSSLE EXPANSION WHICH AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION AND HAS A STRONG. SUPPORT OF NOT JUST THE COUNTY BUT NUMEROUS LOCAL WHEN PART OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE THE EXPANSION OF CARNEGIE CITING A CONFLICT WITH OUR COUNTIES I POLICIES RELATIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL HABITATS. THIS IS A UNIQUE ALBEIT COMPLICATED -- SITUATION AND DISTRICTS SITUATION SPECIFICALLY -- BUT WE DO I VERY MUCH WANT TO ECHO OR SUPPORT FOR THOSE POTENTIAL SOLUTION WANT TO THINK I SENATOR GLAZER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR OTHER CONSIDERATION. I THINK YOU'RE BUDGET EXPERTS BEGAN SUPPORT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S BETH WORST BURKE AS I'M SENATOR GLAZERS SENATE PRESIDENT THE EAST BAY CHAPTER OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY COVERING ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES. A WE THANK SENATOR GLAZERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER AND THE OTHER ON COAUTHORS FOR THIS BALANCED BILL THAT ALLOWS STATE PARKS THE OPTION TO PRESERVE AN EXCEPTIONAL PLACE TESLA. WHILE COMPENSATING OHB AND AVOIDING LENGTHY AND COSTLY LITIGATION. MY CHAPTER AND OUR STATE ORGANIZATION SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL RARE AND UNIQUE BIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THIS PARK. THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS STATE WHICH I BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE SEEN FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS WRITTEN AT RISK CO SIGNED BY OVER FORTY FIVE SCIENTISTS UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS AND LEADERS IN VARIOUS FIELDS SUCH AS ECOLOGIES SYMBOLOGY AND BOTANY. AS WELL AS THE PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND UC BERKELEY PROFESSORS. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE FORTY TWO SPECIAL STATUS WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING EIGHT STATE AND FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES TWENTY EIGHT LOCALLY RARE NAY PLANTS THIRTEEN SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES SEVEN SENSITIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES. CRITICAL HABITAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA READ LIKE IT FRAUD ALAMEDA WHICH SNAKE CRITICAL WILDLIFE CORDER CONNECTING NORTH AND SOUTH MOUNT DIABLO REGIS. ACKNOWLEDGES AUDUBON IMPORTANT BIRD AREA AND FOR OWN CHAPTER IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT'S PART OF OUR OWN CORRAL HOLLOW BIOLOGICAL PRIORITY PROTECTION AREA ONLY ONE OF FIFTEEN ALL OF ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS HIGH PRIORITY FOR PROTECTION BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE RESOURCES. SORT OF LIKE TO SPEAK TO BE ABOUT US FAQS FAIRNESS IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF FACTS THERE WAS NO PRE ACQUISITION <u>&lt;c.green&gt; I&lt;/c&gt;</u> ARE FOR TESLA. SO THE STATE WAS OPERATING IN THE DARK IN SOME SENSE IN WHAT WAS THERE AND WHETHER IT WAS EVEN APPROPRIATE TO BE PURCHASED FOR OHP USE. IT'S TRUE THAT THE STATE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE AIRY SCIENTISTS COLLECTED DATA INTO ITS SURVEYS FOR BOTH CARNEGIE AND TESLA. HOWEVER THE ANALYSIS WAS REALLY DONE BY THE SCIENTISTS I REFERRED TO EARLIER IN THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS STATEMENT. THEY DETERMINED BY DOING A THOROUGH ANALYSIS THAT THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF RARE AND HIGH VALUE NATURAL RESOURCES HERE. AND THAT THERE'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE BY COMPARING CARNEGIE TO TESLA THAT A WHICH WE USE SEVERELY DAMAGES NATURAL RESOURCES AND UNDERMINES HABITAT INTEGRITY. THIS IS A UNIQUE PARK AND UNIQUE CASE. AS FAR AS THEIR EIGHT OHB PARKS THAT'S TRUE COMPARED TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED STATE PARKS BUT IT NEGLECTS TO MENTION THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF U. S. FOR SERVICE AND BLM LAND. OPEN FOR A EACH USE AND PAID FOR IN PART BY GRANTS FROM THE OHP. THE CARNEGIE GENERAL PLAN FOR TESLA DOESN'T IN FACT AS AN ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES FOR ALL HP USE IS PROHIBITED. IT ONLY DISALLOWS FACILITIES. ON IN ADDITION [inaudible] I CARNEGIE. WE KNOW THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY AND CALIFORNIA POPULATIONS ARE INCREASING. BUT THE CARNEGIE SRV A VISITOR SHIP HAS DECLINED CONSISTENTLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND NOW IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HAD ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND VISITORS. WE CONTRAST THIS TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASING SINCE THAT TIME AND HAD SEVENTEEN MILLION VISITORS. THE TERMS OF FAIRNESS WE RECOGNIZE THAT TESLA PURCHASE THIS THAT THE TEST WAS PURCHASED WITH THE INTENT THAT ABUSE AS OHP. BUT THIS WAS BEFORE ALL THE FACTS WERE KNOWN IN THIS CASE WE RECOGNIZE THAT A WHICH WE SHOULD BE COMPENSATED THAT ALL PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE SHOULD GO BACK TO A WAGE FEE FOR PURCHASE OF LAND. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP PREVENT A LENGTHY AND COSTLY LITIGATION BATTLE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL BOTH TO THE CONSERVATION OHB COMMUNITIES. AS FAR AS THE FUTURE GOES I HAVE TO ASK WHEN YOU FAX COME TO LIGHT DO WE ALLOW REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION FOR US NOW AND FOR THE FUTURE. ONE HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL STATE PARKS ROLE IN THIS HOLD UP. BILLY EVEN HAVE THE OPTION TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND FINALLY I'D LIKE TO QUOTE FROM THE SCIENTISTS WHOSIGNED THE STATEMENT YOU SAID SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST FORWARD THINKING WORK OF OUR STATE. IN RESEARCH EDUCATION AND GOVERNMENT HAS RESULTED IN THE PRESERVATION OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WONDERS FOR THE FUTURE. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN TO ALLOW STATE PARKS TO EXERCISE THEIR BEST JUDGMENT IN THIS DISPOSITION OF THIS UNIQUE PLACE IN THIS UNIQUE CASE. THANK YOU THINK YOU'RE MUCH ANYBODY ELSE BECAUSE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY.

LARA CULTURAL ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY INTEREST BEGAN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL TODAY MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TERRY MIKHAIL WITH AARON READ NOT SO SEATS. REPRESENTING A COALITION OF OFF HIGHWAY MEET VEHICLE OF RECREATION STE [inaudible] UP. SENATOR GLAZER HAS A WELL DESERVED REPUTATION FOR BRINGING DISPIRITO ARTIE'S TOGETHER AND TRYING TO WORK OUT DIFFICULT SITUATIONS -- I KNOW HE HAS TRIED ON THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. A UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SEVENTY CLIENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. I KNOW OF NONE IN WHICH THERE IS MORE PASSION IN MORE DISAGREEMENT. THEN WHEN WE DEAL WITH OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AND COMMUNITIES THAT OPPOSE IT. BUT MADAM CHAIRMAN [inaudible] LAST YEAR. WE SPENT THE ENTIRE SESSION MEETING [inaudible] WEEKLY. HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS THOUSANDS OF HOURS TO REVISIT THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. UNTIL LAST YEAR THE PROGRAM WAS SUNSET ID EVERY FIVE YEARS. BUT AFTER LAST YEAR'S SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATION WITH SENATOR ALLEN. THAT WAS STRONGLY SUPPORTED. BY BOTH ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND THE OHP COMMUNITY. THE SUNSET WAS REMOVED. AND IT WAS REMOVED BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD. THAT NO PART OF PARKS. HAS A GREATER RESOURCE OF SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS. THEN THE OVERWEIGHT FEE PROGRAM IT'S IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER. THEN ON SEPTEMBER THIRD WHILE THAT NEGOTIATION WAS GOING ON THE FRIENDS OF TESLA WALKED AWAY FROM THE DISCUSSIONS. AND DECIDED NOT TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND IN THE MEMO THAT THEY SHARED WITH THE COMMUNITY. THEY SAID THAT INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING IT THEY WOULD RATHER. PUT THEIR RESOURCES INTO THE FACT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE ALTAMONT LANDFILL OPEN SPACE COMMITTEE. BUYING THIS PROPERTY. NOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT ONE OF THE MANDATES OF THAT COMMITTEE IS THAT THEY CANNOT ALLOW ANY OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. THE SECOND ISSUE. IS THAT THAT COMMITTEE AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH. TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAD THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FUND. WHEN ASKING THE PARK'S WHAT THE VALUE OF THESE THIRTY ONE HUNDRED ACRES ARE [inaudible] OR IS [inaudible] A THEY SAID. IT WOULD BE A GREAT STEEL AT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR LEGISLATION. SAYS THAT THIS PROPERTY CAN BE SOLD AT BELOW MARKET VALUE. AT BELOW MARKET VALUE. AND IT IS CLEARLY INTENDED. BUT THIS PARTICULAR ENTITY PURCHASE THIS PARK [inaudible] SECONDLY. SENATOR GLAZER IS VERY FAIR. BUT WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THE BILL DELIBERATELY AVOIDS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT THE GROUP. THAT DIRECTS. THE ACQUISITION AND THE CARE OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. IS AN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE COMMISSION WITHIN PARKS. UNDER THIS BILL. THEY ARE COMPLETELY BYPASSED. THE DECISION ON THE SALE IS MADE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS. ALL OF US WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] RECOGNIZE. THAT OHB HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED THE RED HEADED STEPCHILD OF PAR. YOU COULD WRAP ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. BY CHAPPY EASY BURKE THEY VERY DELIBERATELY CREATED A SEPARATE DIVISION OF OHP TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATIONS. BECAUSE THEY SAID PARKS HAD DIFFERENT INTERESTS. IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. THE ENTIRE PROPERTY HAS BEEN MAPPED. SEVEN YEARS MAPPING THIS PROPERTY EVERY SQUARE FOOT HAS BEEN MAPPED. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN MORE THAN FAIR WITH WORKING WITH THE DIVISION IN TERMS OF HOW THIS WILL BE USED. ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THIS TWO THOUSAND ACRES WILL NOT BE USED FOR OHP IT WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK YOU'RE MUCH NEXT PERSON AGAIN OPPOSITION CLEAR MADAM CHAIR CAPPING LEDGE REPRESENT ANY OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF OF WRITERS -- WE TO MR MCHALE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF EXPLAINING OUR POSITIONING JUST TO REITERATE THAT LAST YEAR ON S. B. TWO FORTY NINE BY SENATOR ALLEN THAT WAS A YEAR LONG PROCESS AND IT WAS A PAINFUL PROCESS AT TIMES. AND THERE WAS A REAL TUG AND PULL BETWEEN THE BE -- CONTINUATION OF OFF ROAD VEHICLE RECREATION PURSUIT AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ALL WORKED COLLABORATIVE -- TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS INC. YOU'LL SEE BY SOME OF THE PICTURES OF THE BEEN HANDED OUT -- THE KIND OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AT THE CARNEGIE AREA AND SO WE WOULD JUST URGE YOU TO RESPECT THE PROCESS THAT YOU WERE PART UP LAST YEAR. AND CONTINUING -- SP TWO FORTY NINE THERE'S ALSO TO BE AN OUT REACH US STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AS A AS PART OF SP. TWO FORTY NINE AND THAT WOULD BE A PROPER PLACE FOR SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE BUT SHORT CIRCUITING IT AND BY PASSING IT. IS VERY PROBLEMATIC AND WHILE THIS IS PRESENTED AS A DISTRICT ISSUE IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN THESE ARE STATE PROPERTIES AND ONCE YOU START DOWN THIS ROAD AND SET THE PRECEDENT. ARM BAND REALLY EVERY STATE PROPERTY. IS SUBJECT TO DISTRICT WENT SO WE WOULD ASK FOR EVERYONE TO WORK TOGETHER AND TO CONTINUE. PALM WHAT THE WHAT THE PLANT YOU THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE BEEN IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY. TO THE MICROPHONE NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING COMMISSIONERS DAVID PICKET REPRESENTING DISTRICT -- THIRTY SIX AMERICAN MOTORCYCLIST ASSOCIATION DISTRICT THIRTY SEVEN DISTRICT THIRTY EIGHT CAL FOUR WHEEL DRIVE ASSOCIATION OASIS FOR KIDS. AND A HOST OF OTHERS WHERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND FOR CORRECTIVE PURPOSES IT IS NOT A PARK. THE LEGAL DEFINITION AS A STATE VEHICLE RECREATION AREA. THAT WAS BUILT DESIGNED AND PURCHASED FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AND A LEGAL AND MANAGED. ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] OKAY. A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HURT AND THIS -- THIS BILL HAS CERTAINLY -- INSPIRED OF LOT OF OF INTEREST FOR AN AREA THAT. FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT I'M AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IT. THREE MY DISTRICT TOUCHES IT I'M AT THE TOP OF THE ULTIMA. I'M SO. MY MY I THINK MY ISSUE IS AROUND THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND AND SOME THINGS ARE GLAZER I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. AND IS AB THORNY ISSUE THAT THE LAND WAS PURCHASED. THROUGH THIS FUND BY THE OFF ROAD PEOPLE WHO USE IT -- I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU SENATOR GLAZER IS WOULD YOU BE WILLING. TWO TAKE OUT AT THE SECTION THAT SAYS THAT IT CAN BE SOLD FOR BELOW MARKET VALUE BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW AND I CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PART OF SALES OF A CITY PROPERTIES THAT YOU CAN SELL FOR A DOLLAR -- TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF SOMETHING WHICH OF COURSE THEN WOULD NOT -- COME ANYWHERE NEAR SINCE THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS USED OUT OF FEES FEES PEOPLE PAID THINKING THEY'RE GONNA HAVE OFF ROAD AND NOW WE'RE SAYING. AND AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT THEY'RE STILL UP A SINGLE CASE ARE STILL LITIGATION GOING ON SO THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS PIECE OF LAND. STILL UNCERTAIN BUT YOU'RE SAYING IF. IF IN FACT S. FOUND THAT CAN'T BE USED FOR THIS. THEN IT COULD BE SOLD. FOR BELOW MARKET VALUE. THAT MONEY THEN TO BE USED TO PURCHASE OTHER AREAS. ARE YOU WILLING OR WHAT WAS THE REASONING FOR ALLOWING THE STATE. SELES AT BELOW MARKET VALUE WHICH AGAIN BIKE BY DEFINITION. IS LESS THAN THE NINE BILLION DOLLARS THAT. THAT HONEST CALIFORNIANS HAVE PAID INTO A FUND THAT WE SAID WE USE FOR ONE THING. MANAGER THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I IT WASN'T MY INTENTION TO SHORT. CHANGE THE FUND THAT DIES YOU HAD CORRECTLY STATED IT'S COLLECTED THESE FEES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. OUT WHAT WE WERE DOING WITH THE BILL WAS REFLECTING WHAT. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS. I THAT WHEN A PROPERTIES IT'S TO BE ROUTE PRESERVE FOR OPEN SPACE THAT THAT'S PART OF THE THE CURRENT LAW AND WEAKENING COOPERATE BUT I I WOULD BE WILLING -- TO I HAD TO DELETE THAT IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE ASKING DELETE AT LESS THAN FAIR MARKET VALUE. AYE AND AND DATA ELIMINATE THAT PHRASE I IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO SHORT CHANGE THE FUN I THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF A PARKING REDWOOD VALLEY ALL THE ELEMENTS INCLUDING WHEN THEY GET THE MONEY BACK AND I CERTAINLY WOULD. WANT TO GET THE MONEY BACK SO I I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT YES OKAY. YES MISTER PATTERSON -- YOU STATED ARE THE TEARS. CERTAIN LAW THAT YOU AND COOPERATED. WITH THAT STATEMENT. WOULD TAKING THE STATEMENT OUT. A STILL ALLOW THE PROCESS TO SELL IT FOR LESS [inaudible] THEN. THE MARKET VALUE BECAUSE YOU STATE ITSUSE I GUESS IS NOW DETERMINE TO BE OPEN. IF U. DESIGNATED FOR OPEN YOU DON'T YOU OPEN. THE DIRECT -- LIKELIHOOD -- THAT SOME AGENCY DIVISION OR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO DECIDE TO SELL IT FOR LESS. THEN OF FAIR MARKET VALUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AYE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO IT I'M HEARING THAT QUESTION FROM THE CHAIR NOW I IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO SHORT CHANGE THE FUND -- SO IT IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STAFF IN OUR UNDERSTANDING IF WE EXPLICITLY SAY IT MUST BE SOLD FOR MARKET VALUE THEN THAT WOULD BE THE LAW WHICH WOULD THEN CIRCUMVENT AND THE OTHER LAW THAT SAYS IT MAY BE SOLD OR MUST BE SOLD FOR LESS THAN MARKET VALUE FOR CONSERVATION. HIT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF YOU SELL IT I MEAN FOR THE CONSERVATION BUT BUT THE THEN NINE MILLION I THINK IS THE PART THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THEN MUST BE ABLE TO GO BACK. TO PURCHASE OTHER LAND FOR OFF ROAD VEHICLE [inaudible] ACCESS. I GUESS THE ONLY AND MY ONLY REACTION TO AT THE MOMENT IS THAT. AS WE KNOW APPRAISALS ARE DONE BASED ON SOME THAT. DESCRIPTION OF HOW THAT. PIECE OF LAND MIGHT BE USED AND THAT [inaudible] I YOU KNOW WHAT RAISES A FLAG WITH ME IS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT AN APPRAISAL TO BE DONE IS IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A SUBDIVISION OUT THERE. BECAUSE THAT WOULD REALLY BE A FAIR. APPRAISAL OF WHAT THAT LAND WHATEVER EVENTUALLY BE USED FOR APPROVED FOR SELF. BECAUSE IT GOES BACK. TO THE DEFINITIONS THAT ARE USED IN TERMS OF FIRE. HOW THAT MARKET VALUE IS DETERMINED IF THE MARKET VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON CONSERVATION LAND? THEN I'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT WE BE CLEAR HOW IT'S BEING VALUED -- BUT THAT WOULD BICU THE CAUTION THAT I WOULD PUT FORWARD ON THAT [inaudible] AB WHEN. WHAT'S BEFORE US IS YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE OUT LANGUAGE. BUT I DO ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT IN SPECIFIED LANGUAGE. THAT IT WILL NOT BE SOLD FOR LESS THAN MARKET VALUE. BUT ONCE AGAIN I I'D BE COMFORTABLE IF WE COULD DEFINE THE TERMS THAT I'M NOT SURE I WERE ABLE TO DEFINE THE TERMS AT THE MOMENT. AND AGAIN I HAD NO ONE THAT I DON'T BE DIFFICULT BUT THAT. BUT THE REALITY HERE IS TERMS. LANGUAGE AND IDENTIFICATION LANGUAGE MEANS SOMETHING WE HEARD EARLIER FROM. UP BOB BUT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WHICH SAID. THAT THIS IS AN OFF ROAD VEHICLE DESIGNATION AND TO DESIGNATED OPEN SPACE AND AVAILABLE FOR CONSERVATION SEEMS TO ME TO BASICALLY INVITE -- THE DEVALUATION OF THAT PROPERTY SO FOR A LOT REASONS I'M REALLY REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHERE WE ARE HERE. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING TO HAVE A RESOLUTION OF ANY ANY REAL FAIRNESS. SIR I'D I DON'T GO THROUGH THE CHAIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE APPRAISAL THAT WAS. DONE FOR THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE WHEN THEY STARTED TO ASSEMBLE THESE UNITS AND I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND WHAT WAS USED TO AND WHETHER THAT APPROPRIATE SOUL WAS DEFINED. AS AN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKER SOMETHING DIFFERENT I JUST DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THE COUNTY HAS ANY IDEA OF THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT HOSE PURCHASES HAPPENED I THINK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES SO QUITE SO QUITE A LONG TIME AGO. LOOK MY LIFE INSURANCE TOO TO YOU IS THAT I IT'S NOT MY INTENTION TO SHORT CHANGE THE FUND. I THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT GET THE BEST VALUE THEY COULD. BUT I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE IS A SUBDIVISION. BECAUSE IT'S A WIDE EXPANSE OF LAND IN THE COUNTY MAY HAVE ITS OWN FOR HOUSE EVERY FIFTY ACRES. AND THEN YOU GET A SITUATION WHERE THE MARKET VALUE WAS TWO HUNDRED HOMES AND I I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR EITHER CELLS TRYING TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE. I THINK THE I THINK THEY THE IDEA THAT THAT. THIS IS GOING TO BE -- APPRAISED AT AT THE SUBDIVISION I THINK IS A VERY EXCESSIVE -- AND AUTUMN. DETERMINATION HERE ARE JUST AS EXCESSIVE AS SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING -- TO APPRAISE THIS IS CONSERVATION LAND. THIS HAS GOT TO BE AN OPEN MARKET FREE MARKET. A ASSESSMENT OF THIS THAT'S MY FIRST CONCERN I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING THERE HERE. MY SECOND MY SECOND THE CONCERN. REALLY IS THE EVEN IF YOU MADE THE FOR THE FUND HOLE THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN FIND A SIGNIFICANT REPLACEMENT WITH THIS KIND OF VALUE IN THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT BY OFF ROAD FOLKS -- I JUST THINK IS OF UP A REAL. UP A DIFFICULT POSSIBILITY I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF THIS IS SIMPLY A MANEUVER. IN ORDER TO TAKE THE GROUND AND TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR CLAIMS THAT YOU JUST BASICALLY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING HERE BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE THAT TO ME AND I I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT. AND I AND I DON'T THINK. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS BEEN OF LESSEN FORTHCOMING THAT IS THAT IS THE PURPOSE. THAT IS THE PURPOSE IS TO TAKE THIS LAND AND DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT. THAT'S THE PURPOSE NOT RIGHT NOW. THAT THAT UP SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE NOT WITH THE BILL BUSINESS IS TED THAT THE PURPOSE THAT THE LAND WAS PURCHASED. THE DESIRE FOR THAT PROPONENTS IS THAT IT BE USED FOR CONSERVATION. I THINK THAT THAT. FOR ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER AND I I HAD THE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS BILL IS DUE AT THAT THE THESE WARRING PARTIES BEEN WHORING FOR A LONG LONG TIME AYE AYE AND I UNDERSTAND SIR THAT YOUR YOUR AND AND WE SIMPLY WANT A PET RIGHT NOW WE'VE THAT WITH PARTY. LIKE RATTLE PIECE I UNDERSTAND I HIM BEAT WELL WHEN WE MET WE MET WITH THE FIRE BUT THE DIRECTORS APARTMENT PARTS OF IRAQ. A THAT THAT THEIR THEIR VIEW WAS WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT AS AN OPTION STEVE. CATHERINE WE MET TOGETHER AND AND THAT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE THEM THAT OPTION IF THEY DECIDED THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH OF THE LITIGATION. WAS TOO I WAS TO MOVE THIS DISTRICT BILL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING DOESN'T TAKE A SIDE IN THE DISPUTES -- AS I SAID I HAVE A AT THE FACILITY IN MY DISTRICT TODAY I HAVE MANY CONSTITUENTS TO ENJOY IT. I AM AND IT'S NOT MY ATTEMPT TO CURTAIL THAT ACTIVITY -- IT'S TO GIVE AN OPTION THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY GET THAT THEY DECIDE TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THAT. I THOUGHT THAT THE BILL GIVES THEM THAT OPTION NOW MANDATE WHATSOEVER OKAY [inaudible] FROM. AGAIN I WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I WILL NOT. SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD OUT OF THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND I SAID ON APPROPRIATIONS. IF WE HAVE NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE UP I THINK THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS NEED TO BE MADE WHOLE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF IT CAN'T BE THROUGH THE SALE. THEN I THINK THEN I THINK THE INTERESTED PARTIES IN CONSERVATION NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT FUND HOLE OF THAT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. I AMIF IT CAN'T BE THROUGH THE LAND SALE THEN I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER MECHANISM IN PLACE. SO WHILE THAT WE CANNOT REWRITE THE BILL TODAY I UNDERSTAND IS A THORNY ISSUE AND I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD ABOUT IT FOR YEARS TO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GUYS ARE TRYING. TO A THREAD THAT NEEDLE -- SO I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I AM. I WANT EVERYONE TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I AM SAYING FURTHER AND I WILL -- SERVING MAKE THAT VERY WELL KNOWN THAT IF WE CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T. WORKING WITH LEDGE COUNCIL FIND A LEGAL WAY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT NINE MILLION DOLLAR THAT WENT INTO THE PURCHASE OF THAT LAND. TO MAKE THAT FUND HOLE IF THAT LAND THEN SHOULD BE PUT INTO CONSERVATION. AT FAIR ENOUGH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION THAT WOULD BE MY INTENTION TO MATCH YOUR DESIRES IS WEAKENED THE BILL FOUGHT WITH THAT CONDITION I'M. I WILL BE SUPPORTED MR POTATO I'LL MOVE THE BILL. LIKE TO ASK OF THE OPPONENTS. IS THIS MERELY A THE A NINE MILLION DOLLAR MAKE COAL. AND IF THAT TAKES PLACE DOES THAT SATISFY YOUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT ARE. I DO WANT TO SOME LOCAL I. I DO NOT BELIEVE. IN ANY WAY THAT SENATOR GLAZER. WANTS TO ROB OHP I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT AS MAKE UP AND I JUST THINK IT WAS. IT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT. THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T MAKE THE THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS WAS A PURCHASE IN. NINETEEN NINETY THE VALUE OF THAT PROPERTY NOW AT A LOW VALUE IS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR HP TO GO OUT AND BUY ANOTHER PROPERTY THEY HAVE TO BUY IT. AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRICES NOT NINETEEN NINETY PRICE. SO WE WOULD SAY THAT IF SENATOR GLAZERS BILL IS TO MOVE FORWARD IT'S GOING TO BE THE MARKET VALUE. WHICH PARKS WILL DETERMINE THAT IT'S CLOSER TO TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THEN. NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
