02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:25.891
SEEING AND HEARING NONE.

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:28.360
MR GABRIEL YOU MAY CLOSE.

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:29.995
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER --

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:31.530
I JUST SAY I RESPECTFULLY

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:32.631
DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM

02:09:32.698 --> 02:09:34.633
IRVINE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS --

02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:36.168
IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM I THINK

02:09:36.235 --> 02:09:37.469
THAT MASS SHOOTINGS ARE PROBLEM

02:09:37.536 --> 02:09:38.804
OUR SOCIETY.

02:09:38.871 --> 02:09:39.905
I SUSPECT THAT IF MY COLLEAGUE

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:41.540
WENT KNAUS MOST PARENTS IN HIS

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:42.708
COMMUNITY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.376
MASS SHOOTINGS OR PROBLEM.

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:45.144
THEY WOULD AGREE THAT THEY ARE

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:46.478
PROBLEM AND I THINK WHAT'S

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:47.813
FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF US IS

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:48.947
THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:49.748
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH IS A

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.984
REASONABLE MODEST COMMONSENSE

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.018
MEASURE.

02:09:53.085 --> 02:09:54.419
ON THE ISSUE OF GUNS THERE SO

02:09:54.486 --> 02:09:55.721
MUCH PUSH BACK AND I JUST WANT

02:09:55.787 --> 02:09:56.922
TO CLARIFY.

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:58.824
THIS IS NOT A MEASURE TO TAKE

02:09:58.891 --> 02:10:00.626
FOLKS GUNS AWAY.

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:01.894
MULTI BURST TRIGGER ACTIVATORS

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:03.662

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:05.397

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:07.866

THINGS ARE LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:12.638
MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE USED

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:13.972
IN A WAYS THAT ARE LEGAL UNDER

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:14.907
STATE LAW.

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.608
AND REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

02:10:16.675 --> 02:10:18.777
THESE DEVICES WHICH ARE ALREADY

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.579
ILLEGAL UNDER STATE LAW WILL BE

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:21.413

GREATER PROPORTIONALITY IN OUR

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:48.433
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.168
UNDER EXISTING LAW OUR STATE HAS

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:51.036
ONE OF THE MOST CONFUSING

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:52.704
SENTENCING STRUCTURES IN THE

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:53.438

PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE OFTEN

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.212
UNCERTAIN WITH THE INTERPLAY

02:12:00.279 --> 02:12:00.779
BETWEEN VARIOUS SENTENCING

02:12:00.846 --> 02:12:03.782
SCHEMES. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM

02:12:03.849 --> 02:12:04.983
OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES THE

02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:06.652
CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HAS GROWN

02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:07.653
EXPONENTIALLY.

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:09.154
INCLUDING OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:10.155
SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS ON OUR

02:12:10.222 --> 02:12:11.990

02:12:12.057 --> 02:12:13.458
AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I HAVE

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:15.661

02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:16.962
DRUGS THE TOUGH ON CRIME

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:19.531
APPROACHES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.066
THIS IS RESULTED OFTEN IN A

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.868
CYCLE OF CRIME AMONG

02:12:22.934 --> 02:12:23.835
DISADVANTAGED AND UNDERSERVED

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:27.606
COMMUNITIES.

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:30.142
WHAT THIS BILL IS A SMALL CHANGE

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.843
IN A LARGER SYSTEM WHICH SEEKS

02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.111
TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS BY RESTORING

02:12:33.178 --> 02:12:35.013
SENTENCING PROPORTIONALITY AND

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.448
PREVENTING INDIVIDUALS FROM

SERVING MORE TIME? FOR AN

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:39.618
ENHANCEMENT THEN THE UNDERLYING

02:12:39.685 --> 02:12:41.219
CRIME ITSELF.

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:42.854
ULTIMATELY THIS BILL WOULD HELP

02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:44.289
TO REFINE ARE CONFUSING

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:46.692
SENTENCING LAWS BY INSURING THAT

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:48.660
A FULL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT DOES

02:12:48.727 --> 02:12:49.961
NOT EXCEED TWICE A NUMBER OF

02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:51.396
YEARS FOR THE BASE TERM.

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:52.864
IT'S A MEASURED AND CAREFULLY

02:12:52.931 --> 02:12:54.032
CRAFTED BILL THAT DOES NOT

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:55.667
ELIMINATE ANY ENHANCEMENTS AND

02:12:55.734 --> 02:12:57.069
DOES NOT INCLUDE A HOST OF

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:59.104
OFFENSES THAT ARE NO SERIOUS

02:12:59.171 --> 02:12:59.805
VIOLENT.

02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:01.340
IN NATURE AND WITH THAT

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:09.481
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

02:13:09.548 --> 02:13:10.749

VERY STRONG OPPOSITION

02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:18.824
[inaudible]

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.293
NOT BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.795
SIMPLE.

02:13:23.862 --> 02:13:24.563

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:25.764
PROPORTIONAL [inaudible]

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.733
CRIMINAL CODE.

02:13:27.799 --> 02:13:31.570
BUT BECAUSE PASSING THIS LAW.

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:33.105
IS GONNA MAKE LIFE VERY ON

02:13:33.171 --> 02:13:34.906
SIMPLE AND DISPROPORTIONATE FOR

02:13:34.973 --> 02:13:36.875
THE VICTIMS LITTERED DESPERATELY

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:39.077
UNDERSERVED BY THE US.

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:40.345
THIS GIVES A VOLUME DISCOUNT TO

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:42.881
CRIMINALS.

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:45.117
SO LONG AS THEY GET CENTS FOR

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:46.184

WHO IS COMPLETELY THROWN ASIDE

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.158
BY THE US?

AND IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME OF THE

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:56.995
GROSSEST MOST SEVERE CRIMES ON

02:13:57.062 --> 02:13:59.064
CHILDREN.

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:01.366
LET'S TAKE A FEW EXAMPLES.

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:03.168
LARRY NASSER HAD OVER A HUNDRED

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:05.303
AND SIXTY VICTIMS MANY

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:07.205
CALIFORNIANS.

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:09.608

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:17.549

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:19.017
THOSE VICTIMS WHAT ARE YOU

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:20.419
SAYING TO THE FOURTEEN AND

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:21.820
FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS.

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:24.256
THE OTHER HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:24.856
THAT WERE VICTIMIZED BY LARRY

02:14:24.923 --> 02:14:25.957
NASSER.

02:14:26.024 --> 02:14:27.092
YOU'RE SAYING I'D RATHER HAVE A

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:27.893
SIMPLE CODE IN THIS IS THE ONLY

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.895
WAY TO DO IT.

02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:31.596
THEY ALSO WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:34.065
BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T COVER.

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.901
NON FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A

02:14:35.967 --> 02:14:37.803
MINOR.

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:40.272
ONLY FORCIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:14:40.338 --> 02:14:42.874
A MINOR IS COVERED BY THIS.

02:14:42.941 --> 02:14:43.875

THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.548
THINK THE CRIMINAL SHOULD HAVE

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.450
TO SERVE MORE TIME.

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:52.517

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:04.055

02:16:29.548 --> 02:16:31.149
BODILY INJURY.

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.717
WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH THIS

02:16:32.784 --> 02:16:34.119

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:14.459
THEY DESERVED.

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:16.161
EXTENDED SENTENCES DO NOT LEAD

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:17.596
TO A DECREASE IN CRIME OR

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:38.450
POINT THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

AND TRYING THEM AS ADULTS WHAT

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:56.434
DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN A

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.802
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SHARES A

02:17:57.869 --> 02:17:58.870
CELLBLOCK.

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.905
WITH A FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD.

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:04.009
MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:18:04.075 --> 02:18:05.043
THAT ARE THROWN IN PRISON WITH

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:07.512
ADULTS.

02:18:07.579 --> 02:18:08.980
ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

02:18:09.047 --> 02:18:11.216
INSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM.

02:18:11.282 --> 02:18:13.685
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT VICTIMS AND

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:15.654

WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:18:21.559 --> 02:18:23.528
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CORRECT

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:25.230
MANY OF THE WRONGS THAT WE HAVE

02:18:25.296 --> 02:18:27.132

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:28.466
THIS BILL.

02:18:28.533 --> 02:18:31.136
IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO REDEFINE

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:32.537
CALIFORNIA'S COMPLICATED

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:33.672
SENTENCING APPROACH AND

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:35.040
REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT TO A

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER --

02:18:55.293 --> 02:18:56.528
FIRST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I

02:18:56.594 --> 02:18:57.796
WANT TO CLEAR ONE THING UP

02:18:57.862 --> 02:18:59.164
CHILDREN DO NOT GET SENT TO

02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:01.466
PRISON WITH ADULTS.

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:02.467
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO LET'S

02:19:02.534 --> 02:19:04.202
JUST DISPENSED WITH THAT BALD

02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:07.272
HEAD SECOND OF ALL NO VICTIM I

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.673
DON'T THINK VICTIMS.

02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.541
WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

02:19:09.607 --> 02:19:10.775
CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED AGAINST

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:16.848
THEM?

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:17.882
WHEN YOU'RE THINK WHEN THEY'RE

02:19:17.949 --> 02:19:18.516
THINKING ABOUT THE CRIME

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:19.684
COMMITTED AGAINST THEM I REALLY

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:21.419
DON'T THINK THAT WHAT'S FIRST

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:22.620
AND FOREMOST IN THEIR MIND IS

02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:24.622
THE RACE?

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.557
OF THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE

02:19:25.623 --> 02:19:28.226
CRIMES TO BRING RACE INTO IT IS

02:19:28.293 --> 02:19:29.994
INSULTING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.696
COLOR YOU ARE WHEN YOU COMMIT

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:32.497
THE CRIME OR WHAT COLOR THE

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:33.331
VICTIM IS.

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:35.533
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO JUST BE

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:40.839
OUT OF THE CONVERSATION --

02:19:40.905 --> 02:19:42.107
THE ARGUMENTS FOR THIS BILL

02:19:42.173 --> 02:19:44.175
SUGGESTS THAT.

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:45.643
THE SENTENCING LAWS THEY'RE JUST

02:19:45.710 --> 02:19:47.645
TOO CONFUSING.

02:19:47.712 --> 02:19:49.114
SO I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT ANYBODY

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.381
WHO IS AN ATTORNEY A CRIMINAL

02:19:50.448 --> 02:19:51.916
DEFENSE ATTORNEY OR ANYBODY WHO

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:53.251
SUGGESTING THAT OUR CRIMINAL

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:54.385
SENTENCING LAWS ARE TOO

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:55.320
CONFUSING.

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:56.521
PERHAPS THEY MIGHT WANT TO

02:19:56.588 --> 02:19:57.756
CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSION ONE

02:19:57.822 --> 02:19:58.723
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE EASILY

02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:00.558
UNDERSTOOD BY THEM.

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:01.359
BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:03.394
MISUNDERSTANDING WHEN IT COMES

02:20:03.461 --> 02:20:04.229
TO CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:06.731
AGAINST CHILDREN.

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:08.133
AND FOR THE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:09.801
BROUGHT FORTH IN THIS BODY

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:11.336
PARTICULARLY RELATING TO CRIMES

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:11.903
AGAINST CHILDREN ARE SEXUAL

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:13.605
CRIMES.

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:14.906
YOU ARE SUGGESTING WITH THIS

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:17.041
BILL THAT --

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:21.613
PRIESTS WHO MOLEST CHILDREN.

02:20:21.679 --> 02:20:22.847
SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

02:20:22.914 --> 02:20:24.582
SHE GET A BUY ONE GET ONE FREE

02:20:24.649 --> 02:20:25.183
IN THIS CASE IS THAT WHAT YOU

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:26.985
WANT.

02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:30.054
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:31.356
I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE WAS

02:20:31.422 --> 02:20:33.558
CORRECT IN STATING THAT WE HAVE

02:20:33.625 --> 02:20:35.994
PASSED QUITE ENOUGH.

02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:37.295
SOFT ON CRIME [inaudible]

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:38.897
PRUE.

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:42.934
CRIMINAL BILLS THIS YEAR ALONE.

02:20:43.001 --> 02:20:45.270
THEN I THINK IT'S ENOUGH THINK

02:20:45.336 --> 02:20:46.738
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING DO NOT

02:20:46.805 --> 02:20:49.474
BE ENTICED BY THE SIREN SONG OF

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:51.176
THIS IS ABOUT RACE.

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:54.479
AND NO THIS IS ONLY ABOUT RACE.

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:55.113
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.247
ABOUT.

02:20:56.314 --> 02:20:57.882
STOP RACE BAITING AND TALK ABOUT

02:20:57.949 --> 02:21:00.585
THE REAL ISSUE IN MAYBE FOR ONE

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:04.022
SOMEBODY HERE.

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:04.756
CAN TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS HOW

02:21:04.823 --> 02:21:07.492
ABOUT THAT.

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:08.960
HIS VICTIMS HAVE A VOICE TO AND

02:21:09.027 --> 02:21:11.162
NEVER TO EVER HEAR ANYONE TALK

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:12.831
ABOUT THE VICTIMS WHO SPEAK IN

02:21:12.897 --> 02:21:14.532
SUPPORT OF SOME BILL LIKE THIS

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:15.266
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

02:21:15.333 --> 02:21:16.401
OPPOSITION SPEAK ABOUT IT

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:18.536
THANKFULLY.

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:20.104
BUT IF YOUR HEART IS SO FULL OF

02:21:20.171 --> 02:21:22.240
COMPASSION.

02:21:22.307 --> 02:21:24.209
THEN SURELY THERE CAN BE SOME

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:25.076
ROOM IN THERE FOR SOME

02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:26.644
COMPASSION FOR THE VICTIMS I

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:34.052
URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible]

WITH THIS BILL.

02:21:45.597 --> 02:21:47.732
AND I THINK.

02:21:47.799 --> 02:21:49.901
WE ALL KNOW THAT WE HAVE PASSED

02:21:49.968 --> 02:21:50.201
[inaudible]

02:21:50.268 --> 02:21:53.238
SEVERAL MEASURES. TO SWING THE

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:55.206
PENDULUM BACK FROM WAR WE WERE

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:57.842
IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES.

02:21:57.909 --> 02:21:59.611
WHEN WE WENT TOO FAR?

02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:02.447
WHEN WE OVER INCARCERATED

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:02.747

ESPECIALLY.

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:08.419
PEOPLE FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

02:22:08.486 --> 02:22:10.588
AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL AND

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:13.258
THE INTENT.

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:15.426
THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF MANY OF

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:16.394
THE BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE

02:22:16.461 --> 02:22:17.896
US.

02:22:17.962 --> 02:22:19.831
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:20.131
[inaudible]

02:22:20.198 --> 02:22:22.300
BUT THIS.

02:22:22.367 --> 02:22:26.704
IS A BAD BILL.

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:30.441

THIRTY YEARS BUT ALSO AS A

04:30:27.077 --> 04:30:29.012
MOTHER OF FOUR THIS IS A BILL

04:30:29.079 --> 04:30:29.680
THAT.

04:30:29.746 --> 04:30:32.082
YES IT IS BACKED UP WITH DATA

04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:34.685
AND RESEARCH BUT IT IS ONE OF

04:30:34.751 --> 04:30:36.320
THOSE BILLS THAT.

04:30:36.386 --> 04:30:37.854
THEORY AND RESEARCH COMING

04:30:37.921 --> 04:30:41.525
CONFLICT WITH PRACTICALITY.

04:30:41.592 --> 04:30:43.560
WE HAVE MANY MANY FAMILIES THAT

04:30:43.627 --> 04:30:45.896
DO NOT JUST HAVE JUNIOR HIGH AND

04:30:45.963 --> 04:30:48.365
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS WE HAVE SOME

04:30:48.432 --> 04:30:49.866
FAMILIES THAT HAVE PRESCHOOL.

04:30:49.933 --> 04:30:53.470
ELEMENTARY JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH

04:30:53.537 --> 04:30:54.438
SCHOOL KIDS WE ALSO HAVE

04:30:54.504 --> 04:30:56.506
FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO BE TO WORK

04:30:56.573 --> 04:30:58.208
EARLY IN THE MORNING AND EVEN

04:30:58.275 --> 04:31:00.844
WITHOUT A NAY THIRTY TIME SLOT

04:31:00.911 --> 04:31:02.980
I'VE OFTEN SEEN KIDS DROPPED OFF

04:31:03.046 --> 04:31:03.947
AT SCHOOLS.

04:31:04.014 --> 04:31:06.650
AT SEVEN A. M. OR EARLIER AND

04:31:06.717 --> 04:31:07.951
THEY'RE SITTING ON THE STEPS IN

04:31:08.018 --> 04:31:09.753
FRONT OF SCHOOLS WAITING FOR

04:31:09.820 --> 04:31:11.888
SCHOOL TO START AND I TELL

04:31:11.955 --> 04:31:14.224
USUALLY EIGHT O'CLOCK AM.

04:31:14.291 --> 04:31:15.826
THIS IS A BILL THAT ALSO WOULD

04:31:15.892 --> 04:31:18.128
AFFECT CHILD CARE GIVERS.

04:31:18.195 --> 04:31:20.230
IT WOULD AFFECT A TEACHERS

04:31:20.297 --> 04:31:21.798
THEMSELVES AS TEACHERS ARE

04:31:21.865 --> 04:31:23.734
PARENTS MANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE

04:31:23.800 --> 04:31:25.135
TO MAKE DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS

04:31:25.202 --> 04:31:26.603
IN THE MORNING.

04:31:26.670 --> 04:31:29.339
AND IT ALSO WOULD HAVE A FACT ON

04:31:29.406 --> 04:31:31.475
AFTER SCHOOL SPORTS IT WOULD

04:31:31.541 --> 04:31:33.677
HAVE AN EFFECT ON A STUDENTS

04:31:33.744 --> 04:31:35.612
COMING HOME LATER IN THE DAY SO

04:31:35.679 --> 04:31:37.914
AS MUCH AS I DO BELIEVE THE

04:31:37.981 --> 04:31:38.715
RESEARCH.

04:31:38.782 --> 04:31:42.019
I DO HAVE TO OPPOSE SECOND THING

04:31:42.085 --> 04:31:43.954
THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUES IS THAT WE

04:31:44.021 --> 04:31:45.689
HAVE STUDENTS AND CHILDREN AND

04:31:45.756 --> 04:31:47.391
FAMILIES STAYING UP LATER AND

04:31:47.457 --> 04:31:49.259
LATER AND LATER BECAUSE THEY ARE

04:31:49.326 --> 04:31:51.128
OUT USING TECHNOLOGY TO FALL

04:31:51.194 --> 04:31:52.029
ASLEEP.

04:31:52.095 --> 04:31:54.264
AND SO THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

04:31:54.331 --> 04:31:55.399
THAT PARENTS HAVE TO BE IN

04:31:55.465 --> 04:31:57.768
CHARGE OF AND GETTING TO THERE'S

04:31:57.834 --> 04:31:59.236
THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL

04:31:59.302 --> 04:32:01.004
SOMETIMES A THREE DIFFERENT

04:32:01.071 --> 04:32:02.773
SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT

04:32:02.839 --> 04:32:04.341
LOCATIONS THEIR KIDS GO.

04:32:04.408 --> 04:32:08.478
TO THIS COULD BE A VERY VERY --

04:32:08.545 --> 04:32:11.081
DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR PARENTS TO

04:32:11.148 --> 04:32:13.183
HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND LESS WE

04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:15.085
HAVE ALL OUR BUSINESSES ALIGNED

04:32:15.152 --> 04:32:18.088
AND SO FORTH SO I REGRET.

04:32:18.155 --> 04:32:20.590
THAT THAT I OPPOSE THIS BILL.

04:32:20.657 --> 04:32:21.892

RIGHT AND THERE'S USUALLY DEBATE

04:32:46.349 --> 04:32:47.951
ON EITHER SIDE OF THOSE.

04:32:48.018 --> 04:32:49.753

EVEN THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED.

04:32:53.290 --> 04:32:57.327
WILL SAY THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR.

04:32:57.394 --> 04:32:59.029
TEENAGERS DO BETTER IF THEY

04:32:59.096 --> 04:33:00.530
START LATER.

04:33:00.597 --> 04:33:01.865
WE KNOW IT'S BETTER FOR OUR

04:33:01.932 --> 04:33:04.167
CHILDREN.

04:33:04.234 --> 04:33:04.801

SCHOOLS I UNDERSTAND IT'S A

04:33:09.406 --> 04:33:11.108
STRUGGLE.

04:33:11.174 --> 04:33:12.142

WORKING FAMILIES.

04:33:20.317 --> 04:33:21.651
AND I FIND THAT AN INTERESTING

04:33:21.718 --> 04:33:23.520
ARGUMENT BECAUSE REALLY ALL

04:33:23.587 --> 04:33:25.489
SCHOOL HOURS CAN BE INCONVENIENT

04:33:25.555 --> 04:33:26.790
FOR WORKING FAMILIES I COME FROM

IT IS VERY CLEAR IN EDUCATION

04:35:47.898 --> 04:35:50.300
THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.

04:35:50.367 --> 04:35:52.769
WHY PUT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

04:36:17.260 --> 04:36:19.329
MY OFFICIAL TIME WAS AT EIGHT

04:36:19.396 --> 04:36:21.698
FORTY FIVE KIDS CAME IN AT EIGHT

04:36:21.765 --> 04:36:22.265
FORTY FIVE AND IT WORKS IN

04:36:22.332 --> 04:36:23.366
FONTANA.

04:36:23.433 --> 04:36:25.001
AND THEY STAGGERED THAT START

04:36:25.068 --> 04:36:26.636
TIME SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET

04:36:26.703 --> 04:36:28.138
TO SCHOOL ON TIME AND IT WORKED

04:36:28.204 --> 04:36:29.339
I WORKED THERE FOR FOURTEEN

04:36:29.406 --> 04:36:30.240
YEARS.

04:36:30.307 --> 04:36:31.641
AND IT WAS FINE PARENTS --

04:36:31.708 --> 04:36:34.878
WERE ABLE TO TO SCHOOL WITHOUT

04:36:34.945 --> 04:36:36.880
ANY PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO

04:36:36.947 --> 04:36:39.149
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT.

04:36:39.215 --> 04:36:41.785
ANYTHING BUT THE KIDS AND WHEN

04:36:41.851 --> 04:36:43.019
WE START HAVING CONVERSATIONS

04:36:43.086 --> 04:36:44.220
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS

04:36:44.287 --> 04:36:45.655
THAT'S THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I

04:36:45.722 --> 04:36:47.023
WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN.

04:36:47.090 --> 04:36:48.992
I APPRECIATE THAT WE ALL HAVE A

04:36:49.059 --> 04:36:50.727
BUSY LIVES AND WE HAVE

04:36:50.794 --> 04:36:52.429
DIFFERENCES IN --

04:36:52.495 --> 04:36:54.531
RESPONSIBILITIES BIKED RESEARCH

04:36:54.597 --> 04:36:55.598
STATES THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR

04:36:55.665 --> 04:36:58.201
KIDS AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT S.

04:36:58.268 --> 04:36:58.835

04:37:07.110 --> 04:37:08.712
I SERVED ON MY SCHOOL BOARD FOR

04:37:08.778 --> 04:37:09.813
OVER TWELVE YEARS BEFORE SERVING

04:37:18.688 --> 04:37:19.856
THIS.

04:37:19.923 --> 04:37:21.124
AND A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY

04:37:21.191 --> 04:37:22.659
THEY SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS LIKE

04:37:22.726 --> 04:37:23.326
THIS.

04:37:23.393 --> 04:37:25.261
IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A VERY

04:37:25.328 --> 04:37:26.796
DIVERSE STATE WITH A LOT OF

04:37:26.863 --> 04:37:28.398

STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:37:39.042 --> 04:37:40.443
BUT MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY

04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:41.945
MUCH LARGER DISTRICTS IN URBAN

04:37:42.012 --> 04:37:43.480

04:37:49.119 --> 04:37:51.454
BEING ABLE COMEDY FOR SPORTS.

04:37:51.521 --> 04:37:53.189

04:38:09.706 --> 04:38:11.141
NEEDS.

04:38:11.207 --> 04:38:13.076

RIGHT TIME TO BE ABLE TO START

04:38:23.753 --> 04:38:25.088
SCHOOL.

04:38:25.155 --> 04:38:26.756
THEY SHOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION

04:38:26.823 --> 04:38:27.857
FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL

CHILDREN IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE

04:38:40.804 --> 04:38:43.273
LAST SIX YEARS SO I HAVE A LOT

04:38:43.339 --> 04:38:44.140
OF PRACTICAL RECENT EXPERIENCE

04:38:44.207 --> 04:38:45.942
WITH THIS.

04:38:46.009 --> 04:38:48.211

04:39:00.690 --> 04:39:02.926
BUT I WAS AMAZED WHEN I WORKED

04:39:02.992 --> 04:39:04.594
AT THE RESEARCH SURROUNDING THIS

04:39:04.661 --> 04:39:05.528
ISSUE IN THE RESEARCH SHOWS

04:39:05.595 --> 04:39:07.464
CONCLUSIVELY.

04:39:07.530 --> 04:39:09.666
THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST

04:39:09.732 --> 04:39:11.201
COST EFFECTIVE THING WE CAN DO

04:39:11.267 --> 04:39:12.402
TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES IN

04:39:12.469 --> 04:39:14.938
CALIFORNIA.

04:39:15.004 --> 04:39:16.473
THE RESEARCH IS VOLUMINOUS IT'S

04:39:16.539 --> 04:39:18.842

04:39:20.043 --> 04:39:22.178
DISPUTING IT.

04:39:22.245 --> 04:39:24.214
NOW I KNOW THE DIFFICULTIES THAT

04:39:24.280 --> 04:39:25.415
TAKING THIS ACTION WOULD CAUSE

04:39:25.482 --> 04:39:26.583
IN MY OWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

04:39:26.649 --> 04:39:27.750
IN OPPOSITION TO IT AND WHEN I

04:39:27.817 --> 04:39:29.419
ASKED THEM WHY.

04:39:29.486 --> 04:39:30.753
THEY SAY WELL WE WOULD HAVE TO

04:39:30.820 --> 04:39:32.288
REORGANIZE OUR BUS SCHEDULES WE

04:39:32.355 --> 04:39:33.456
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A BUS

04:39:33.523 --> 04:39:34.757
AVAILABILITY AND WE HAVE A

04:39:34.824 --> 04:39:36.126
PROBLEM WITH AFTER SCHOOL SPORTS

04:39:36.192 --> 04:39:36.926

04:39:42.465 --> 04:39:44.134
THOSE PROBLEMS.

04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:46.603
UNTIL WE AGREED TO WORK TOWARDS

04:39:46.669 --> 04:39:48.037
THE GOAL OF STARTING SCHOOL

04:39:48.104 --> 04:39:49.639
LATER IN THIS BILL IS THE WAY

04:39:49.706 --> 04:39:52.308
THAT WE DO THAT.

04:39:52.375 --> 04:39:53.576
LET ME SAY AGAIN THIS IS THE

04:39:53.643 --> 04:39:55.278
SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE THING

04:39:55.345 --> 04:39:57.814

GRADUATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA I

04:39:59.482 --> 04:40:00.583
THINK IT'S TIME WE TAKE THAT

STEP.

PARENTS HAVE TO DO.

04:41:18.828 --> 04:41:19.929

BUT MOVING THE START TIME BACK

04:41:47.857 --> 04:41:51.027
IS NOT NECESSARILY GONNA MEAN

04:41:51.094 --> 04:41:52.629
MORE SLEEP FOR EVERY KID.

04:41:52.695 --> 04:41:54.831

04:42:21.557 --> 04:42:23.026
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE NUMBER OF

04:42:23.092 --> 04:42:24.827
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS TO SAY.

04:42:24.894 --> 04:42:26.129
THIS IS NOT YOUR DECISION TO

04:42:26.195 --> 04:42:27.063
MAKE THIS IS OUR DECISION TO

04:42:27.130 --> 04:42:30.233
MAKE AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO

04:42:30.300 --> 04:42:31.067
THE PARENTS IN YOUR SCHOOL BOARD

EVERY CD.

04:42:35.972 --> 04:42:37.040
I AM VERY SURPRISED AT HOW MANY

04:42:37.106 --> 04:42:38.608
FACEBOOK PAGES ARE OUT THERE BY

04:42:38.675 --> 04:42:40.777
THE WAY BUT EVERY CITY HAS A

04:42:40.843 --> 04:42:42.078
DIFFERENT FACEBOOK GROUP AND I

04:42:42.145 --> 04:42:43.313
PUT IT OUT ON ALL OF THEM I

04:42:43.379 --> 04:42:44.981
ASKING THEIR OPINION.

04:42:45.048 --> 04:42:47.884
I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF SAID.

04:42:47.950 --> 04:42:49.719
THEY LIKE THE IDEA OF THE LATER

04:42:49.786 --> 04:42:51.854

04:42:51.921 --> 04:42:53.189
US IMPOSING IT ON THEM THEY

04:42:53.256 --> 04:42:54.657
WANTED TO BE A SCHOOL DISTRICT

04:42:54.724 --> 04:42:56.426
LEVEL DECISION THE OTHER HALF.

04:42:56.492 --> 04:42:57.960
SAID THAT IT DIDN'T WORK FOR

04:42:58.027 --> 04:42:58.828
THEIR SCHEDULES AND THAT

04:42:58.895 --> 04:43:01.030
SACRAMENTO OUGHT NOT BE DECIDING

04:43:01.097 --> 04:43:03.666
FOR EVERYONE AS A WHOLE.

04:43:03.733 --> 04:43:04.500
WHAT TIME KID SHOULD START

04:43:04.567 --> 04:43:05.902
SCHOOL?

04:43:05.968 --> 04:43:07.870

NOT DECIDE THAT WE KNOW BETTER.

04:43:19.382 --> 04:43:20.416
AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE

04:43:20.483 --> 04:43:22.085
DECISION FOR THEM AND NO ONE IS

04:43:22.151 --> 04:43:24.554
DISPUTING THE SCIENCE BUT IT'S

04:43:24.620 --> 04:43:25.788

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS

04:44:21.677 --> 04:44:23.279

AND THE REASON WHY IS IS WHAT

THAT.

04:44:53.776 --> 04:44:55.111
WE NEED TO DEFER THIS TO THE

04:44:55.178 --> 04:44:56.379
LOCAL CONTROL FOR OUR SCHOOL

04:44:56.446 --> 04:44:57.713
BOARDS TO TO WORK THIS OUT I

KNOW THAT THEIR PROBLEMS WITH

04:44:59.482 --> 04:45:00.450
THAT WITH THE SPORTS SCHEDULES

04:45:00.516 --> 04:45:02.351

THIS DEBATE FORWARD --

04:45:15.798 --> 04:45:17.533
IS TO HAVE GROUPS LIKE THE

04:45:17.600 --> 04:45:18.634
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS

04:45:18.701 --> 04:45:20.837

THEN TO HAVE THEM BRING THE

04:45:28.744 --> 04:45:30.379

IMPOSING A SOLUTION AND FOR THAT

04:45:32.315 --> 04:45:33.616
REASON I WANT TO EXPLAIN

THIS BILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME

04:45:51.968 --> 04:45:52.902
AND I'VE BEEN CONFLICTED ON THIS

04:45:52.969 --> 04:45:54.303
BILL FOR A LOT OF THE REASONS I

04:45:54.370 --> 04:45:54.837
THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE

04:45:54.904 --> 04:45:55.838
CONFLICTED.

04:45:55.905 --> 04:45:58.174
ON THIS BILL IS THAT I'VE HEARD

04:45:58.241 --> 04:45:59.775
FROM A LOT OF MY LOCALS --

04:45:59.842 --> 04:46:02.645
THAT DO NOT SUPPORT IT AND THEY

04:46:02.712 --> 04:46:04.247
WANT TO BE ABLE TO RAIN RETAIN A

04:46:04.313 --> 04:46:05.114
DOUBT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THEIR

04:46:05.181 --> 04:46:06.816
RIGHT TO DICTATE WHAT THE START

04:46:06.883 --> 04:46:08.184
TIMES ARE FOR SCHOOLS.

04:46:08.251 --> 04:46:09.218

WHAT MY LOCALS HAVE TO SAY

04:46:14.156 --> 04:46:15.658
BECAUSE THAT MATTERS TO ME AND

04:46:15.725 --> 04:46:18.161
HELPS ME MAKE BETTER DECISIONS

04:46:18.227 --> 04:46:20.062
AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT --

04:46:20.129 --> 04:46:21.864
A LOT OF HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT YOU

04:46:21.931 --> 04:46:22.932
KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF WE

CHANGE SCHOOLS TART START TIMES --

04:46:26.235 --> 04:46:28.137
BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME

04:46:28.204 --> 04:46:30.273
SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE

04:46:30.339 --> 04:46:31.607
IN SUPPORT --

04:46:31.674 --> 04:46:33.109
AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE IN

04:46:33.175 --> 04:46:35.244
PARTICULAR A THREE YEARS AGO

04:46:35.311 --> 04:46:36.979
SIERRA VISTA MIDDLE SCHOOL.

04:46:37.046 --> 04:46:38.981
CHANGED ITS START TIME FROM

04:46:39.048 --> 04:46:39.582
SEVEN FIFTY AM TO EIGHT TWENTY

04:46:39.649 --> 04:46:40.950
FIVE PM.

04:46:41.017 --> 04:46:42.685
SINCE THAT CHANGE.

04:46:42.752 --> 04:46:44.053
THEY HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN

04:46:44.120 --> 04:46:46.889
TARDY'S BY GREATER THAN 90%.

04:46:46.956 --> 04:46:49.091
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DROPPED TO

04:46:49.158 --> 04:46:51.027
JUST THREE POINT 8%.

04:46:51.093 --> 04:46:53.095
THE LOWEST RATE IN ANY SECONDARY

04:46:53.162 --> 04:46:54.497
SCHOOL AND THE HOSPITAL APPOINT

04:46:54.564 --> 04:46:56.098
THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

04:46:56.165 --> 04:46:57.833
THEY HAVE ALSO ONE OF THE

04:46:57.900 --> 04:46:59.402
HIGHEST ATTENDANCE RATES IN THE

04:46:59.468 --> 04:47:01.804
DISTRICT AT 97%.

04:47:01.871 --> 04:47:02.838
AND BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE IN

04:47:02.905 --> 04:47:04.473
THEIR SEATS MORE THE SCHOOL HAS

04:47:04.540 --> 04:47:06.042
WITNESS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT

04:47:06.108 --> 04:47:09.345
INCREASE IN SUSPENSIONS DECREASE.

04:47:09.412 --> 04:47:10.413
THIS BILL.

04:47:10.479 --> 04:47:12.381
I BELIEVE WILL ENSURE THAT

04:47:12.448 --> 04:47:14.483
MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS IN OUR

04:47:14.550 --> 04:47:16.419
STATE ARE ABLE TO READ.

04:47:16.485 --> 04:47:17.987
THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT COME

04:47:18.054 --> 04:47:19.689
FROM THE START TIME BORN OUT OF

04:47:19.755 --> 04:47:22.024
SOUND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO

04:47:22.091 --> 04:47:24.694
THE SLEEP NEEDS OF ADOLESCENCE.

04:47:24.760 --> 04:47:26.896
ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY

04:47:26.963 --> 04:47:28.698
THAT RURAL DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT

04:47:28.764 --> 04:47:30.199
SO THOSE CONCERNS SHOULD BE NO

04:47:30.266 --> 04:47:31.100
AND VOID.

04:47:31.167 --> 04:47:33.169
THERE IS ALSO A THREE YEAR

04:47:33.235 --> 04:47:35.538
IMPLEMENTATION ON THIS BILL AND

04:47:35.605 --> 04:47:37.273
I THINK THAT THAT IS QUITE

04:47:37.340 --> 04:47:39.442
ENOUGH TIME TO GET BUS SCHEDULES

04:47:39.508 --> 04:47:40.810
IN CLASS SCHEDULES IN ORDER I

04:47:40.876 --> 04:47:43.713

THIS BILL ON THE BASIS OF ITS

04:47:53.456 --> 04:47:55.291
SCIENCE.

04:47:55.358 --> 04:47:56.492
AND LONG TERM BENEFITS TO OUR

04:47:56.559 --> 04:47:58.494
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

04:47:58.561 --> 04:47:59.762
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I KNOW SOME

04:47:59.829 --> 04:48:02.198
MAJOR CONCERNS FOR THIS BODY TO

04:48:02.264 --> 04:48:04.834
EXAMINE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. FOR

04:48:04.900 --> 04:48:06.602
DISTRICTS LIKE MINE WITH WORKING

04:48:06.669 --> 04:48:08.371
FAMILIES THERE STILL REMAINS THE

04:48:08.437 --> 04:48:09.605
REALITY THAT CHILDREN WON'T BE

04:48:09.672 --> 04:48:11.874
GETTING DROPPED OFF AT SCHOOL AT

04:48:11.941 --> 04:48:13.676
LATER TIMES SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR

04:48:13.743 --> 04:48:14.977
PARENTS MUST LEAVE.

04:48:15.044 --> 04:48:17.480
EARLY FOR THEIR JOBS.

04:48:17.546 --> 04:48:18.614
THIS PUTS BURDENS ON THE CAMPUS

04:48:18.681 --> 04:48:20.549
IS TO BE OPEN OR TO HAVE SOME

04:48:20.616 --> 04:48:22.818
SORT OF SECURITY OR SUPERVISION

04:48:22.885 --> 04:48:23.753
IN THE MORNING BEFORE SCHOOL

04:48:23.819 --> 04:48:24.987
STARTS.

04:48:25.054 --> 04:48:27.690
AMONG OTHER CONCERNS.

04:48:27.757 --> 04:48:29.825
FURTHERMORE IN JUST ONE OF THE

04:48:29.892 --> 04:48:30.993
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SAN

04:48:31.060 --> 04:48:32.628
BERNARDINO COUNTY.

04:48:32.695 --> 04:48:33.996
THEY'VE ADVISE ME THAT IT'LL

04:48:34.063 --> 04:48:35.698
COST OF APPROXIMATELY TEN

04:48:35.765 --> 04:48:37.533
MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE ENOUGH

04:48:37.600 --> 04:48:39.535
BUSES AND REROUTE. TO REROUTE

04:48:39.602 --> 04:48:42.371
AND TRANSPORT CHILDREN SAFELY.

04:48:42.438 --> 04:48:44.807
SCHOOL WITH THIS NEW START TIME.

04:48:44.874 --> 04:48:47.009
WITH NO STATE SUPPORT.

04:48:47.076 --> 04:48:48.744
THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

04:48:48.811 --> 04:48:50.479
ARE HUGE TO CONSIDER AND MUST BE

04:48:50.546 --> 04:48:53.182
MITIGATED.

04:48:53.249 --> 04:48:54.650
IF WE IS THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT

04:48:54.717 --> 04:48:56.719
MAKE IT A POINT TO ASSIST AND

04:48:56.786 --> 04:48:57.219
SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS TO

04:48:57.286 --> 04:48:58.220
ADEQUATELY.

04:48:59.755 --> 04:49:02.058
BILL WE WILL HURT SCHOOL AND

STUDENT PERFORMANCE.

04:49:03.559 --> 04:49:07.963
RATHER THAN HELP IT.

04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:10.366
WHEN I WANT TO LISTEN ALSO TO

04:49:10.433 --> 04:49:12.301
THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE CALLED ME?

GABBY AND IZZY WHO TELL ME THIS

04:49:16.272 --> 04:49:18.040

SO I URGE YOU THAT [inaudible]

04:49:19.575 --> 04:49:21.310
WE COMMIT.

TRULY SUPPORTING OUR EDUCATIONAL

04:49:23.412 --> 04:49:25.181
INSTITUTIONS MOVING FORWARD TO

04:49:25.247 --> 04:49:27.883
ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION BOLSTERS.

04:49:27.950 --> 04:49:29.885

STUDENTS AND NOT HINDER THEM AS

04:49:32.988 --> 04:49:36.358
WE AS WE IMPLEMENT THIS BILL.

04:49:36.425 --> 04:49:38.928
THANK YOU.

04:49:38.994 --> 04:49:40.596
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN

YOU'RE RECOGNIZED.

04:49:43.265 --> 04:49:44.133
I THINK YOU MEADOW SPEAKER

04:49:44.200 --> 04:49:47.203
MEMBERS AND IT'S INTERESTING FOR

04:49:47.269 --> 04:49:49.271
ME ON SOME LEVEL CITY HERE ALLAH

04:49:49.338 --> 04:49:52.441
TALK ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THE

04:49:52.508 --> 04:49:53.809
DECADES OF EX OF A RESEARCH IN

04:49:53.876 --> 04:49:58.547
THE THE THE THE DATA CLEARLY

04:49:58.614 --> 04:50:01.283
SHOWS AND VOLUMINOUS RESEARCH

04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:03.352
TELLS US.

04:50:03.419 --> 04:50:04.954
A THAT'S AN ARGUMENT I MADE

04:50:05.020 --> 04:50:05.755
ABOUT THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION

04:50:05.821 --> 04:50:07.389
CENTERS.

04:50:07.456 --> 04:50:08.424
THERE HAVE THERE HIM THREE

04:50:08.491 --> 04:50:10.659
DECADES OF A RESEARCH

04:50:10.726 --> 04:50:13.229
OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWING SOMETHING --

04:50:13.295 --> 04:50:15.030
BUT TO THREE YEARS TO GET A A

04:50:15.097 --> 04:50:16.232
ONE CITY PILOT.

04:50:16.298 --> 04:50:17.466
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO THIS FOR

04:50:17.533 --> 04:50:20.903
STATEWIDE CHANGE OF START TIMES --

04:50:20.970 --> 04:50:22.438
THE BIGGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

04:50:22.505 --> 04:50:25.107
MY COMMUNITY IS A STOCKTON

04:50:25.174 --> 04:50:27.910
UNIFIED WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND

04:50:27.977 --> 04:50:28.778
STUDENTS IN IT --

04:50:28.844 --> 04:50:31.447
AND THEY ALSO LOOKED AT THE

04:50:31.514 --> 04:50:33.249
LOOKS LIKE IT'S A WAY TO GO.

04:50:33.315 --> 04:50:34.717
AND THEY TRIED A PILOT FOR A

04:50:34.784 --> 04:50:35.518
YEAR.

04:50:35.584 --> 04:50:37.186
AND WAS AN ABJECT FAILURE.

04:50:37.253 --> 04:50:39.088
TRYING TO COORDINATE THE BUS

04:50:39.155 --> 04:50:40.656
SCHEDULES AND ARTISTS ARE

04:50:40.723 --> 04:50:41.657
GETTING WE HAVE BUSES WE THE

04:50:41.724 --> 04:50:43.125
CITY BUSES IN.

04:50:43.192 --> 04:50:44.460
GETTING KIDS AROUND --

04:50:44.527 --> 04:50:46.428
SO WELL I THINK A BILL LIKE THIS

04:50:46.495 --> 04:50:47.797
THAT WOULD HAVE SAID.

04:50:47.863 --> 04:50:49.165
EVERY DISTRICT SHOULD MAYBE HAVE

04:50:49.231 --> 04:50:51.033
A HEARING ON THIS. TO LOOK AT

04:50:51.100 --> 04:50:53.135
WHAT WORKS FOR THEM.

04:50:53.202 --> 04:50:54.570
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE TO ME

04:50:54.637 --> 04:50:56.305
BUT TO DO A STATEWIDE MANDATE

04:50:56.372 --> 04:50:57.740
ABOUT WHAT TIME SCHOOLS ARE

04:50:57.807 --> 04:50:58.774
GOING TO START.

04:50:58.841 --> 04:51:00.009
JUST SEEMS TO ME TO BE AN OVER

04:51:00.075 --> 04:51:02.945
REACH A AGAIN THE DATA CAN

04:51:03.012 --> 04:51:04.713
REALLY GUIDE US BUT IT'S UP TO

04:51:04.780 --> 04:51:06.448
US THAN TO CREATE GOOD PUBLIC

04:51:06.515 --> 04:51:08.017
POLICY.

04:51:08.083 --> 04:51:08.851
THAT ALLOWS IT TO ACTUALLY BE

04:51:08.918 --> 04:51:10.452
IMPLEMENTED.

04:51:10.519 --> 04:51:11.720
I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE

04:51:11.787 --> 04:51:12.021
[inaudible]

04:51:12.087 --> 04:51:13.722
THANK YOU.

04:51:13.789 --> 04:51:14.323
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBBER YOU ARE

04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:18.894
RECOGNIZED.

04:51:18.961 --> 04:51:20.529
MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I HAD

04:51:20.596 --> 04:51:21.931
DUBBED DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO

04:51:21.997 --> 04:51:23.566
SPEAK ABOUT THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I

04:51:23.632 --> 04:51:25.034
TOLD YOU LAST YEAR.

04:51:25.100 --> 04:51:25.701
THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF

04:51:25.768 --> 04:51:27.469
RESEARCH BUT THAT THIS BILL WILL

04:51:27.536 --> 04:51:28.470
BE KILLED BY IGNORANCE.

04:51:28.537 --> 04:51:31.307
AND IT WAS.

04:51:31.373 --> 04:51:31.907
A LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY A

04:51:31.974 --> 04:51:33.609
COUPLE THINGS ONE YOU KNOW THE

04:51:33.676 --> 04:51:35.511
WORST SCHOOL BOARD MEETING I

04:51:35.578 --> 04:51:39.381
EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

04:51:39.448 --> 04:51:40.115
ABOUT START TIMES.

04:51:40.182 --> 04:51:40.783
YOU THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD KILLED

04:51:40.850 --> 04:51:43.018
EVERYBODY'S CHILD STOLEN EVERY

04:51:43.085 --> 04:51:43.919
GRANDPARENT ON THE FACE OF THE

04:51:43.986 --> 04:51:46.121
EARTH BLOWN UP EVERY BUSINESS

04:51:46.188 --> 04:51:47.256
BECAUSE WE WERE CHANGING THE

04:51:47.323 --> 04:51:48.324
TIME THAT PEOPLE STARTED THE

04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:50.659
SCHOOL.

04:51:50.726 --> 04:51:52.294
EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED

04:51:52.361 --> 04:51:53.896
THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW ABOUT

04:51:53.963 --> 04:51:55.598
KIDS BEING DROPPED OFF AT NOT

04:51:55.664 --> 04:51:56.632
BEING DROPPED OFF IN WHOSE HOME

04:51:56.699 --> 04:51:57.733
WHO'S NOT.

04:51:57.800 --> 04:51:59.902
EXIST IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT

04:51:59.969 --> 04:52:01.470
YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW.

04:52:01.537 --> 04:52:02.872
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

04:52:02.938 --> 04:52:04.473
IN EARLY AND SOMEONE LADEN

04:52:04.540 --> 04:52:05.674
PEOPLE COMPLAIN IF SOMEONE TOLD

04:52:05.741 --> 04:52:07.142
COULD NOT DRIVE SO AND SO THE

04:52:07.209 --> 04:52:07.977
SCHOOL.

04:52:08.043 --> 04:52:10.112
THIS THAT ALL THOSE THINGS EXIST

04:52:10.179 --> 04:52:12.047
RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE A

04:52:12.114 --> 04:52:13.983
PERFECT SYSTEM OF SCHOOL

04:52:14.049 --> 04:52:17.887
STARTING AND STOPPING TO FIT

04:52:17.953 --> 04:52:19.054
EVERY PERSON'S AGENDA IN YOUR

04:52:19.121 --> 04:52:19.555
DISTRICT.

04:52:19.622 --> 04:52:20.189
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS

04:52:20.256 --> 04:52:21.290
WHY WOULD DISTRICTS OFTEN DEBATE

04:52:21.357 --> 04:52:23.025
THIS ISSUE THEY ARE PARALYZED.

04:52:23.092 --> 04:52:24.193
BECAUSE THEY LISTEN TO

04:52:24.260 --> 04:52:26.528
EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL ISSUE AND

04:52:26.595 --> 04:52:27.930
EVEN WHEN YOU GIVE THEM WHAT

04:52:27.997 --> 04:52:29.832
THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE STILL

04:52:29.899 --> 04:52:31.700
HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IT'S TOO

04:52:31.767 --> 04:52:33.302
LATE IT'S TOO EARLY I GOTTA GO

04:52:33.369 --> 04:52:34.904
TO WORK HE'S GOT TO COME HOME.

04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:36.372
SOMEBODY AND PICK UP THE BABY SO

04:52:36.438 --> 04:52:38.374
MY GARDENS UP THAT EXIST RIGHT

04:52:38.440 --> 04:52:41.210
NOW SO LET'S STOP PRETENDING

04:52:41.277 --> 04:52:41.744
THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS

04:52:41.810 --> 04:52:42.244
PERFECT.

04:52:42.311 --> 04:52:43.646
IF YOU EVER SERVED ON A SCHOOL

04:52:43.712 --> 04:52:44.780
BOARD YOU KNOW IT IS MOST

04:52:44.847 --> 04:52:46.615
IMPERFECT IN TERMS OF THE START

04:52:46.682 --> 04:52:48.717
AND STOP TIME AND IS NOT BASED

04:52:48.784 --> 04:52:50.286
ON RESEARCH A DATA IT'S OFTEN

04:52:50.352 --> 04:52:51.520
BASED ON BUSES RUNNING UP AND

04:52:51.587 --> 04:52:52.821
DOWN THE STREET AND A HOST OF

04:52:52.888 --> 04:52:54.356
OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE.

04:52:54.423 --> 04:52:55.791
SO DON'T PRETEND THAT WHAT WE

04:52:55.858 --> 04:52:57.526
HAVE IS A WONDERFUL SYSTEM THAT

04:52:57.593 --> 04:53:00.062
WORKS IT DOES NOT.

04:53:00.129 --> 04:53:01.230
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SEE

04:53:01.297 --> 04:53:02.531
HAVE THE NIGHTMARE GO TO SCHOOL

04:53:02.598 --> 04:53:03.933
BOARD MEETING WOULD YOU DECIDE

04:53:03.999 --> 04:53:05.834
TO CHANGE THE TIME TO SCHOOLS TO

04:53:05.901 --> 04:53:07.336
TRY TO MAKE IT FAIR FOR THOSE

04:53:07.403 --> 04:53:09.104
WHO HAVE LAID WHO NOW WANT EARLY.

04:53:09.171 --> 04:53:10.572
AND YOU WILL HAVE A NIGHTMARE

04:53:10.639 --> 04:53:12.441
AND A MIDNIGHT MEETING AS WE DID

04:53:12.508 --> 04:53:13.709
IN SAN DIEGO.

04:53:13.776 --> 04:53:14.710
SO I JUST WANT KNOW WHAT YOU

04:53:14.777 --> 04:53:17.313
HAVE IS NOT PERFECT.

04:53:17.379 --> 04:53:17.980
BUT THE LEASES HAVE SOME

04:53:18.047 --> 04:53:19.915
RESEARCH BEHIND IT.

04:53:19.982 --> 04:53:21.183
AND IT HAS BEEN MANY YEARS AND

04:53:21.250 --> 04:53:22.584
ALTHOUGH SCHOOL BOARD TWENTY

04:53:22.651 --> 04:53:23.552
YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

04:53:23.619 --> 04:53:25.888
THE SAME SUBJECT.

04:53:25.955 --> 04:53:26.789
FINALLY THIS YEAR SAN DIEGO IS

04:53:26.855 --> 04:53:28.490
GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT.

04:53:28.557 --> 04:53:30.092
BECAUSE WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING

04:53:30.159 --> 04:53:31.460
TO HELP KIDS AND WHEN THE DATA

04:53:31.527 --> 04:53:33.829
COMES BACK AND SAYS THIS WILL

04:53:33.896 --> 04:53:35.397
ACTUALLY HELP TO KEEP YOUR

04:53:35.464 --> 04:53:37.833
SCHOOLS HAVE THE KIDS IN SCHOOL

04:53:37.900 --> 04:53:39.068
HAVE BEEN DOING BETTER SO FORTH

04:53:39.134 --> 04:53:41.603
AND SO ON THEN YOU OUGHT TO AT

04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:43.539
LEAST LISTEN TO IT.

04:53:43.605 --> 04:53:45.374
AND THE REALITY IS WE WILL

04:53:45.441 --> 04:53:47.242
ALWAYS HAVE THESE CONCERNS

04:53:47.309 --> 04:53:48.711
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LIFE IS VERY

04:53:48.777 --> 04:53:51.013
COMPLEX WE DON'T JUST HAVE

04:53:51.080 --> 04:53:52.348
EVERYBODY GOING TO WORK AT THE

04:53:52.414 --> 04:53:53.482
SAME TIME COMING BACK THE SAME

04:53:53.549 --> 04:53:53.949
TIME.

04:53:54.016 --> 04:53:55.351
THE BUSES DON'T ALWAYS RUN THE

04:53:55.417 --> 04:53:56.952
SAME WAY ON EVERY COMMUNITY BUT

04:53:57.019 --> 04:53:58.787
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

04:53:58.854 --> 04:54:00.456
WHEN YOU CHANGE THEIR START TIME

04:54:00.522 --> 04:54:01.857
PEOPLE HAVE A FIT THEY SAID ALL

04:54:01.924 --> 04:54:03.492
DIAGRAM OF THE RUNWAY

04:54:03.559 --> 04:54:05.060
EVERYBODY'S GOAL SOME GO HAPPEN

04:54:05.127 --> 04:54:05.995
TO EVERYBODY?

04:54:06.061 --> 04:54:08.030
THEY ALL JUST.

04:54:08.097 --> 04:54:08.630
AND THEY SHOW UP AT SCHOOL ON

04:54:08.697 --> 04:54:09.732
TIME.

04:54:09.798 --> 04:54:11.734
THAT'S THE REALITY.

04:54:11.800 --> 04:54:12.868
SO IF YOU THINK THIS IS

04:54:12.935 --> 04:54:14.269
SOMETHING THAT HELPS KIDS YOU

04:54:14.336 --> 04:54:15.738
SHOULD BOTH.

04:54:15.804 --> 04:54:16.772
FOR IF YOU THINK IT DOESN'T HELP

04:54:16.839 --> 04:54:18.073
KID YOU SHOULDN'T.

04:54:18.140 --> 04:54:19.641
BUT DON'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN A

04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:22.478
BASKET BASED ON GROWN FOLKS.

04:54:22.544 --> 04:54:23.078
WHAT THEY THINK IS CONVENIENT

04:54:23.145 --> 04:54:24.246
FOR THEM?

04:54:24.313 --> 04:54:25.214
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

04:54:25.280 --> 04:54:27.850
BECAUSE WE WILL SOLVE AS PARENTS

04:54:27.916 --> 04:54:29.151
WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.

04:54:29.218 --> 04:54:30.919
ALL OF YOU HAVE.

04:54:30.986 --> 04:54:32.755
YOU GOT KIDS IN SCHOOL NOW MANY

04:54:32.821 --> 04:54:33.756
OF YOU WORKING TO TRY TO FIGURE

04:54:33.822 --> 04:54:35.224
OUT HOW LITTLE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL

04:54:35.290 --> 04:54:37.159
LATE.

04:54:37.226 --> 04:54:38.660
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

04:54:38.727 --> 04:54:39.294
WHO SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

04:54:39.361 --> 04:54:41.597
TO BE WORKING A AND YOU'RE JUST

04:54:41.663 --> 04:54:42.798
AND YOU ADAPT IN THE SCHOOL

04:54:42.865 --> 04:54:44.500
MAKES THOSE THINGS HAPPEN.

04:54:44.566 --> 04:54:46.402
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS

04:54:46.468 --> 04:54:47.369
REALLY GOING TO MOVE THE

04:54:47.436 --> 04:54:50.472
CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD.

04:54:50.539 --> 04:54:51.607
WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME

04:54:51.673 --> 04:54:52.574
THAT WE SPENT TOO MUCH TIME

04:54:52.641 --> 04:54:53.475
TALKING AT ALL PEOPLE AND THEIR

04:54:53.542 --> 04:54:55.044
NEEDS.

04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:56.111
AND VERY SUBTLE DO WE TALK ABOUT

04:54:56.178 --> 04:54:57.913
YOUNG PEOPLE AND WHAT IS GOING

04:54:57.980 --> 04:54:59.481
TO REALLY HELP OUR KIDS GET FROM

04:54:59.548 --> 04:55:00.916
THE BOTTOM TO AT LEAST THE

04:55:00.983 --> 04:55:02.885
MIDDLE IF NOT THE TOP.

04:55:02.951 --> 04:55:04.086
IT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS

04:55:04.153 --> 04:55:05.354
HAS POINTED OUT BY RESEARCH WE

04:55:05.421 --> 04:55:06.789
NEED TO GRAB IT.

04:55:06.855 --> 04:55:07.923
AND I CAN TELL YOU TO TURN IT

04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:09.191
OVER TO THE SCHOOL BOARDS BAY

04:55:09.258 --> 04:55:11.193
WILL BE PARALYZED BY THE NUMBER

04:55:11.260 --> 04:55:13.028
OF PEOPLE SHOW UP.

04:55:13.095 --> 04:55:14.396
I TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY

04:55:14.463 --> 04:55:16.498
WENT FROM.

04:55:16.565 --> 04:55:17.099
EIGHT TO EIGHT THIRTY AND HOW

04:55:17.166 --> 04:55:17.666
SOME BY ANOTHER THE WORLD'S

04:55:17.733 --> 04:55:18.200
GONNA FALL APART IN THIRTY

04:55:18.267 --> 04:55:19.501
MINUTES.

04:55:19.568 --> 04:55:21.203
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:22.137
YOU DO IN THIS FOR THE RIGHT

04:55:22.204 --> 04:55:23.705
REASON.

04:55:23.772 --> 04:55:24.540
AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO

04:55:24.606 --> 04:55:26.708
HELP OUR KIDS WE HAVE TO LEAD

04:55:26.775 --> 04:55:27.843
AND MANY OF OUR PORTS WILL BE

04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:29.378
HAPPY BECAUSE EVEN THEY WILL

04:55:29.445 --> 04:55:30.979
HAVE TO TAKE THE HEAT.

04:55:31.046 --> 04:55:32.047
THAT'S ALL THAT WAS DONE BY

04:55:32.114 --> 04:55:33.082
THOSE PEOPLE SACRAMENTO SO WE

04:55:33.148 --> 04:55:35.184
JUST GOT IMPLEMENTED.

04:55:35.250 --> 04:55:36.618
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL REALIZE

04:55:36.685 --> 04:55:37.486
WHAT THEY REAP THE BENEFITS AS

04:55:37.553 --> 04:55:39.388
WE'VE SEEN IN SO MANY CASES AS

04:55:39.455 --> 04:55:40.956
WELL AS HERE ON THE FLOOR.

04:55:41.023 --> 04:55:42.658
IT WILL HELP OUR CHILDREN.

04:55:42.724 --> 04:55:44.326
AND I HOPE THAT'S A CONVERSATION

04:55:44.393 --> 04:55:45.894
WE HAVE IS THIS GOOD FOR KIDS.

04:55:45.961 --> 04:55:48.097
RESEARCH SAYS YES THEY'RE THE

04:55:48.163 --> 04:55:49.398
MAKE OLD FOLKS LIKE US FEEL

04:55:49.465 --> 04:55:51.233
SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY

04:55:51.300 --> 04:55:52.968
WOULD SO WHAT WE'VE ALREADY HAD

04:55:53.035 --> 04:55:54.736
EXPERIENCE IN SCHOOL WE'VE DONE

04:55:54.803 --> 04:55:55.137
WHAT WE DON'T DO.

04:55:55.204 --> 04:55:56.905

I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR

04:56:11.120 --> 04:56:12.321
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO

THE METAPHOR OF WHAT ABOUT THE

04:56:16.391 --> 04:56:17.960
KIDS SO LET ME TO SHARE A QUICK

04:56:18.026 --> 04:56:18.494
STORY.

04:56:18.560 --> 04:56:20.229
I'M SURE DID A LITTLE BIT BEFORE

04:56:20.295 --> 04:56:21.964
BUT I AM I I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN

04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:23.732
ABOUT IT BUT I DROPPED OUT OF

04:56:23.799 --> 04:56:25.000
HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS OUT RULES

04:56:25.067 --> 04:56:25.567
OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE

04:56:25.634 --> 04:56:26.602
HEIGHTS.

04:56:26.668 --> 04:56:29.271
AND THE REASON WHY THAT HAPPENED

04:56:29.338 --> 04:56:30.806
WAS BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY

04:56:30.873 --> 04:56:33.675
LATE CONSTANTLY TARDY ROOSEVELT

04:56:33.742 --> 04:56:35.210
HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME HAD A

04:56:35.277 --> 04:56:37.112
THREE TRACK SYSTEM REMEMBER WHEN

04:56:37.179 --> 04:56:37.746
WE HAD THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS A

04:56:37.813 --> 04:56:39.148
GOOD IDEA.

04:56:39.214 --> 04:56:40.082
AND IT STARTED AT SEVEN THIRTY

04:56:40.149 --> 04:56:41.583
IN THE MORNING.

04:56:41.650 --> 04:56:43.452
I WASN'T DRILL TEAM I HAVE TO BE

04:56:43.519 --> 04:56:46.221
ON CAMPUS AT SIX AM AND WHEN WE

04:56:46.288 --> 04:56:47.089
WEREN'T.

04:56:47.156 --> 04:56:48.690
I HAD TO EITHER WALK TO SCHOOL

04:56:48.757 --> 04:56:50.392
WHICH WAS ABOUT TWO MILES OR

04:56:50.459 --> 04:56:52.461
TAKE -- THE

04:56:52.528 --> 04:56:54.730
AND THE TRANSIT OR TAKE A BUS

04:56:54.796 --> 04:56:56.031
AND THERE WAS TWO BUS LINES THAT

04:56:56.098 --> 04:56:57.332
I HAVE TO TAKE SO I HAVE TO

04:56:57.399 --> 04:56:58.867
LEAVE HOME.

04:56:58.934 --> 04:57:00.936
AROUND SIX IN THE MORNING.

04:57:01.003 --> 04:57:03.305
IF I IF I DID THIS AND THEIR GOT

04:57:03.372 --> 04:57:05.774
THERE THERE GOT TO A POINT WHERE

04:57:05.841 --> 04:57:07.509
I WAS JUST TOO TIRED.

04:57:07.576 --> 04:57:10.412
THANK YOU I WAS TOO TIRED AND I

04:57:10.479 --> 04:57:12.214
WAS CONSTANTLY LATE I WAS

04:57:12.281 --> 04:57:14.416
CONSTANTLY TARDY.

04:57:14.483 --> 04:57:16.084
AND BECAUSE I WAS TARDY.

04:57:16.151 --> 04:57:18.086
SCHOOL AT THE TIME HAD A POLICY

04:57:18.153 --> 04:57:21.356
THAT IF YOU WERE TRUANT OR TARDY.

04:57:21.423 --> 04:57:22.324
PARENTS AT LU ES DE WOULD GET A

04:57:22.391 --> 04:57:23.825
TICKET.

04:57:23.892 --> 04:57:26.261
AND YOU WOULD GET FINE.

04:57:26.328 --> 04:57:28.063
AND MAYBE PERHAPS THAT YOU MAY

04:57:28.130 --> 04:57:29.932
NOT REMEMBER THAT BUT LOW INCOME

04:57:29.998 --> 04:57:31.567
PARENTS REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO

04:57:31.633 --> 04:57:32.534
BE GETTING TICKETS BECAUSE

04:57:32.601 --> 04:57:33.268
YOU'RE FIFTEEN MINUTES LATE TO

04:57:33.335 --> 04:57:35.070
CLASS.

04:57:35.137 --> 04:57:36.371
ROTH WELL HAS CHANGED NOW AND

04:57:36.438 --> 04:57:37.139
SEVERAL OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE

04:57:37.206 --> 04:57:39.841
CHANGED. TO HAVE A LATER START

04:57:39.908 --> 04:57:41.376
TIME WHICH HAS DRAMATICALLY

04:57:41.443 --> 04:57:42.878
IMPROVED [inaudible]

04:57:42.945 --> 04:57:45.981
GRADUATION RATES IN FACT BECAUSE

04:57:46.048 --> 04:57:47.849
IF THE SCHOOL STARTS AT EIGHT

04:57:47.916 --> 04:57:49.885
O'CLOCK OR EIGHT THIRTY KIDS ARE

04:57:49.952 --> 04:57:51.019
ACTUALLY THERE EARLIER.

04:57:51.086 --> 04:57:52.821
BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING BREAKFAST

04:57:52.888 --> 04:57:54.356
SCHOOL AND FOR MANY KIDS AND

04:57:54.423 --> 04:57:55.357
MANY KIDS IN LOW INCOME

04:57:55.424 --> 04:57:56.792
COMMUNITIES.

04:57:56.858 --> 04:57:58.093
THE ONLY TIME THAT THEY ACTUALLY

04:57:58.160 --> 04:57:59.728
GET TO EAT HIS BREAKFAST AND

04:57:59.795 --> 04:58:00.462
LUNCH [inaudible]

04:58:00.529 --> 04:58:02.397
SCHOOL.

04:58:02.464 --> 04:58:03.298
SO THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE

04:58:03.365 --> 04:58:04.700
SLIGHTLY EARLIER TO HAVE

04:58:04.766 --> 04:58:05.968
BREAKFAST THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

04:58:06.034 --> 04:58:08.937
GET DROPPED OFF AT THAT TIME.

04:58:09.004 --> 04:58:10.606
SO I JUST WANT US TO THINK ABOUT

04:58:10.672 --> 04:58:12.174
WHAT THE DAILY LIFE LIVED

04:58:12.241 --> 04:58:15.077
EXPERIENCES OF THESE KIDS ARE I

04:58:15.143 --> 04:58:16.078
REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS

04:58:16.144 --> 04:58:16.612
ANGELES.

04:58:16.678 --> 04:58:18.947
ELLIE WAS THE IS THE LARGEST

04:58:19.014 --> 04:58:20.282
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF

04:58:20.349 --> 04:58:22.918
CALIFORNIA THE SECOND LARGEST IN

04:58:22.985 --> 04:58:24.453
THE NATION I CALLED MY

04:58:24.519 --> 04:58:26.521
SUPERINTENDENT.

04:58:26.588 --> 04:58:28.156
I CALLED ARBORE PRESIDENT THEY

04:58:28.223 --> 04:58:29.057
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS

04:58:29.124 --> 04:58:30.459
HAPPENING BROUGHT TO THEIR

04:58:30.525 --> 04:58:32.661
ATTENTION THEY HAVE CONCERNS.

04:58:32.728 --> 04:58:33.295
THERE'S A THREE YEAR

04:58:33.362 --> 04:58:35.364
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS.

04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:37.733
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND WE

04:58:37.799 --> 04:58:39.434
ALWAYS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

04:58:39.501 --> 04:58:41.436
IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE STUDENT

04:58:41.503 --> 04:58:42.537
THAT'S ACTUALLY ATTENDING

04:58:42.604 --> 04:58:42.838
[inaudible]

04:58:42.904 --> 04:58:44.506
THE CLASSROOM HOW DO WE MAKE

04:58:44.573 --> 04:58:46.041
SURE.

04:58:46.108 --> 04:58:47.876
THE KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE

04:58:47.943 --> 04:58:49.811
AXES.

04:58:49.878 --> 04:58:52.914
EQUITY OPPORTUNITY JUSTICE AND

04:58:52.981 --> 04:58:54.383
MIMI A SLIGHT CHANCE AT A BETTER

04:58:54.449 --> 04:58:55.951
LIFE AND THE LIFE THAT THEY'RE

04:58:56.018 --> 04:58:56.618
CURRENTLY LIVING.

04:58:56.685 --> 04:58:59.788
AND IF THE SCIENCE IS THERE.

04:58:59.855 --> 04:59:00.422
EITHER WE BELIEVE EVEN THE THIGH

04:59:00.489 --> 04:59:03.025
AND OR WE DON'T.

04:59:03.091 --> 04:59:05.560
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DO

04:59:05.627 --> 04:59:08.597
SOMETHING DIFFERENT KIDS. TO DO

04:59:08.664 --> 04:59:10.399
SOMETHING THAT IS.

04:59:10.465 --> 04:59:12.434
THE ACTUAL BECAUSE THE SCIENCE

04:59:12.501 --> 04:59:14.269
IS THERE.

04:59:14.336 --> 04:59:15.971
THE REST OF THE ISSUES WILL GET

04:59:16.038 --> 04:59:17.706
TO FIGURE OUT BUT WILL NEVER GET

04:59:17.773 --> 04:59:18.607
TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY

04:59:18.674 --> 04:59:20.309
RESOLVING THEM.

04:59:20.375 --> 04:59:22.144
IF WE CAN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE

04:59:22.210 --> 04:59:24.446
FORWARD AN EDUCATION AND THERE

04:59:24.513 --> 04:59:25.914
ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT WE TALK

04:59:25.981 --> 04:59:27.549
ABOUT EDUCATION SO MANY THINGS

04:59:27.616 --> 04:59:28.216
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY WHICH

04:59:28.283 --> 04:59:29.084
ARE.

04:59:29.151 --> 04:59:31.153
CREDIBLE AND VALID POINTS BUT WE

04:59:31.219 --> 04:59:32.688
NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT

04:59:32.754 --> 04:59:33.989
OTHERWISE THE STATE OF

04:59:34.056 --> 04:59:36.325
CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY FACING.

04:59:36.391 --> 04:59:38.960
A DECREASE AND DOCTORS AND

04:59:39.027 --> 04:59:40.329
NURSES AND TEACHERS AND

04:59:40.395 --> 04:59:42.631
ENGINEERS AND IF WE CAN GET OUR

04:59:42.698 --> 04:59:44.633
KIDS TO SIMPLY GRADUATE.

04:59:44.700 --> 04:59:46.301
THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA INCREASE

04:59:46.368 --> 04:59:47.903
THE WORK FORCE FOR CALIFORNIA

04:59:47.969 --> 04:59:49.738
AND THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE.

04:59:49.805 --> 04:59:51.373
SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

04:59:51.440 --> 04:59:52.541
FOR AN AYE VOTE AND PLEASE

04:59:52.607 --> 04:59:54.576
ALWAYS CONSIDER.

04:59:54.643 --> 04:59:55.210
WHAT THE STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY

04:59:55.277 --> 04:59:56.611
GOING THROUGH I WONDER GOING TO

04:59:56.678 --> 04:59:58.146

YOU KNOW I I COME FROM THIS

05:00:32.214 --> 05:00:33.715

OF MY CHILDREN WENT TO NINE

05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:36.351

WORLD.

05:00:38.820 --> 05:00:40.389
AND I CAN TELL YOU.

05:00:40.455 --> 05:00:41.623

IOWA.

05:00:44.559 --> 05:00:46.128
AND IN IOWA WHICH IS WHAT ONE

05:00:46.194 --> 05:00:47.996
TWO OR THREE IN THE NATION.

05:00:48.063 --> 05:00:49.131
THEY STARTED LATER FOR THE CORE

05:00:49.197 --> 05:00:51.566
PROGRAMS.

05:00:51.633 --> 05:00:52.768
NOW THEY IT IS ZERO PERIOD BUT

05:00:52.834 --> 05:00:53.034
THEY HAD.

05:00:53.101 --> 05:00:56.004
THE SAME THING [inaudible]

05:00:56.071 --> 05:00:58.039
YOU KNOW.

05:00:58.106 --> 05:00:59.541
WE TALK ABOUT [inaudible]

05:00:59.608 --> 05:01:02.911
I SCIENCE.

05:01:02.978 --> 05:01:05.213
WE WORRY ABOUT BUS SCHEDULES.

05:01:05.280 --> 05:01:06.214
WERE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT

05:01:06.281 --> 05:01:09.084
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A REAL ISSUE.

05:01:09.151 --> 05:01:10.652
AND OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS WE

05:01:10.719 --> 05:01:12.087
HAVE.

05:01:12.154 --> 05:01:13.522
REDESIGNED OUR ENTIRE.

05:01:13.588 --> 05:01:16.358
ENERGY GRID SYSTEM IN THE STATE.

05:01:16.425 --> 05:01:17.125
WE ARE CHANGING OUR HOLD

05:01:17.192 --> 05:01:18.660
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THIS

05:01:18.727 --> 05:01:20.328
STATE WE BROUGHT IN NEW

05:01:20.395 --> 05:01:22.497
TECHNOLOGIES AND GOT RID OF A

05:01:22.564 --> 05:01:23.999
WHOLE INDUSTRY MOVING OUT OF

05:01:24.065 --> 05:01:25.167
FOSSIL FUELS.

05:01:25.233 --> 05:01:26.501
WE COULD CHANGE OUR WHOLE

05:01:26.568 --> 05:01:28.670
ECONOMY.

05:01:28.737 --> 05:01:29.504
UNDER THE IDEA OF PROTECTING

05:01:29.571 --> 05:01:32.407
SCIENCE.

05:01:32.474 --> 05:01:33.742
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SCIENCE ON

05:01:33.809 --> 05:01:35.143
WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR OUR

05:01:35.210 --> 05:01:38.113
CHILDREN RECOGNIZING THAT?

05:01:38.180 --> 05:01:39.881
WE'RE NOT DOING SO GREAT IN

05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:41.116
CALIFORNIA I THINK WE'RE LASSEN

05:01:41.183 --> 05:01:42.951
MICE I WENT.

05:01:43.018 --> 05:01:43.585
FORTY THREE I THINK THAT'S KIND

05:01:43.652 --> 05:01:44.753
OF A GOOD THING WHEN I CAME HERE

05:01:44.820 --> 05:01:46.621
SIX YEARS AGO WHERE.

05:01:46.688 --> 05:01:47.222
FORTY NINE SO WE'RE KIND OF

05:01:47.289 --> 05:01:49.658
MOVING DOWN IN QUALITY BUT WE

05:01:49.724 --> 05:01:51.293
STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

05:01:51.359 --> 05:01:52.127
AND I THINK SCIENCE SHOWS WE

05:01:52.194 --> 05:01:54.629
SHOULD DO THIS.

05:01:54.696 --> 05:01:55.697
ADDITIONALLY I THINK IT'S NO.

05:01:55.764 --> 05:02:00.302
OF TWO MONTHS AGO THE PTA WAS

05:02:00.368 --> 05:02:01.803
AGAINST THIS I GOT A LETTER

05:02:01.870 --> 05:02:05.440
TODAY THE PTA IS SUPPORTING THIS.

05:02:05.507 --> 05:02:07.175
THEY'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE

05:02:07.242 --> 05:02:08.143
TO DO MORE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO

05:02:08.210 --> 05:02:10.111
GET THEM THROUGH THIS.

05:02:10.178 --> 05:02:13.281
AND I LEAVE YOU THIS LAST WILL.

05:02:13.348 --> 05:02:14.249
FIVE BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY ONE

05:02:14.316 --> 05:02:18.453
THE OLDEST PEOPLE AROUND HERE IN.

05:02:18.520 --> 05:02:19.488
NINETEEN SIXTY SIX WHEN I WENT

05:02:19.554 --> 05:02:20.555
TO HIGH SCHOOL AND TOWARDS AYE

05:02:20.622 --> 05:02:21.923
SCHOOL.

05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:26.294
CLASSES STARTED AT NINE AM.

05:02:26.361 --> 05:02:27.696
NOW THEY HAD ZERO PERIOD YOU CAN

05:02:27.762 --> 05:02:28.997
GO IN EARLIER IF YOU NEED SOME

05:02:29.064 --> 05:02:30.532

HE SAID HE WORKED FOR A LIVING

05:02:36.972 --> 05:02:38.607
NOT LIKE HIS OTHER TEACHERS.

05:02:38.673 --> 05:02:40.542
HE WAS A QUITE A CHARACTER.

05:02:40.609 --> 05:02:43.478
BUT WE STARTED AT NINE AM.

05:02:43.545 --> 05:02:45.480
AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX

05:02:45.547 --> 05:02:47.749
CALIFORNIA ACADEMICALLY WAS TWO

05:02:47.816 --> 05:02:49.818
OR THREE IN THE NATION.

05:02:49.885 --> 05:02:51.553
WE ARE ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOL

05:02:51.620 --> 05:02:52.454
SYSTEMS IN THIS IN THE UNITED

05:02:52.521 --> 05:02:54.756
STATES.

05:02:54.823 --> 05:02:56.458

TO ENSURE OUR CHILDREN.

05:03:02.464 --> 05:03:05.834
CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND GO FORWARD.

05:03:05.901 --> 05:03:08.069
IF WE CAN A CHANGE OF ECONOMY

05:03:08.136 --> 05:03:09.371
AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.

05:03:09.437 --> 05:03:11.706
BECAUSE OF SCIENCE.

05:03:11.773 --> 05:03:13.275
WE CAN USE SCIENCE ENSURE THAT

05:03:13.341 --> 05:03:14.943
OUR CHILDREN HAVE THE BEST

05:03:15.010 --> 05:03:16.778
OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

THIS BILL.

05:03:30.625 --> 05:03:32.727
IN SPITE OF MANY CONCERNS THAT I

05:03:32.794 --> 05:03:33.728
HAD -- THEN

05:03:33.795 --> 05:03:35.597
ABOUT THE BILL.

05:03:35.664 --> 05:03:38.199
AND I STILL HAVE THOSE CONCERNS.

05:03:38.266 --> 05:03:40.201
ABOUT THE BILL.

05:03:40.268 --> 05:03:42.637
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

05:03:42.704 --> 05:03:44.539
QUESTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE ON

05:03:44.606 --> 05:03:46.608
THE FLOOR JUST NOW.

05:03:46.675 --> 05:03:48.777
IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THIS BILL

05:03:48.843 --> 05:03:50.078
MAY BE MORE THAN ANY I'VE EVER

05:03:50.145 --> 05:03:52.981
HEARD IN FOUR YEARS.

05:03:53.048 --> 05:03:55.517
EVERY ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE FOR

05:03:55.584 --> 05:03:57.419
OR AGAINST WAS VALID AND EVERY

05:03:57.485 --> 05:04:00.221
ARGUMENT THAT YOU HEARD ME YOU

05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.755
COULD SAY.

05:04:00.822 --> 05:04:01.990
IS THE RIGHT THING.

05:04:02.057 --> 05:04:03.892
I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING THAT

05:04:03.959 --> 05:04:05.994
SOUNDED MORE CORRECT OR OR NO

05:04:06.061 --> 05:04:08.129
THAT'S WRONG.

05:04:08.196 --> 05:04:09.464
EVERYTHING I HEARD.

05:04:09.531 --> 05:04:11.433
WAS THE FACT.

05:04:11.499 --> 05:04:12.701
THAT MIGHT BE A FIRST AT LEAST

05:04:12.767 --> 05:04:16.605
WHAT I'VE HEARD ON THIS FLOOR --

05:04:16.671 --> 05:04:17.572
THE MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER ALLEN

05:04:17.639 --> 05:04:19.040
AS BOOKING AND I'M JUST GETTING

05:04:19.107 --> 05:04:20.842
JUST KIDDING I JUST GET.

05:04:20.909 --> 05:04:22.310
I WAS STARTING THERE I'M

05:04:22.377 --> 05:04:23.745
STARTING THE READING ALREADY --

05:04:23.812 --> 05:04:25.981
IT IS A FACT.

05:04:26.047 --> 05:04:29.284
IS AN IRREFUTABLE FACT.

05:04:29.351 --> 05:04:30.051
THAT THE BRAIN SCIENCE SAYS THIS

05:04:30.118 --> 05:04:32.787
IS GOOD.

05:04:32.854 --> 05:04:35.423
FOR IT IS ALSO IRREFUTABLE FACT.

05:04:35.490 --> 05:04:36.925
THAT IF YOU MAKE THIS CHANGE

05:04:36.992 --> 05:04:37.225
[inaudible]

05:04:37.292 --> 05:04:38.727
YOU'RE CREATING. FOR MANY MANY

05:04:38.793 --> 05:04:41.563
PARENTS A DEPARTURE.

05:04:41.630 --> 05:04:43.131
BECAUSE IT IS A FACT.

05:04:43.198 --> 05:04:44.666
THAT MOST PARENTS DO NOT HAVE

05:04:44.733 --> 05:04:46.201
THE KIND OF FLEXIBLE JOBS.

05:04:46.267 --> 05:04:47.736
THAT WE DO.

05:04:47.802 --> 05:04:49.904
OR THAT OTHERS DO THAT ALLOW

05:04:49.971 --> 05:04:51.873
THEM TO SAY TO THEIR EMPLOYER

05:04:51.940 --> 05:04:52.173
[inaudible]

05:04:52.240 --> 05:04:53.708
COMING IN.

05:04:53.775 --> 05:04:56.144
HALF HOUR LATER OR WHATEVER UP

05:04:56.211 --> 05:04:58.613
TIME LATER THAT'S JUST A FACT.

05:04:58.680 --> 05:04:59.848
AND IF THIS BILL GOES FORWARD.

05:04:59.914 --> 05:05:01.883
AND PREVAILS AND IS SIGNED INTO

05:05:01.950 --> 05:05:04.519
LAW.

05:05:04.586 --> 05:05:05.954
THE AUTHOR IN THE COALITION

05:05:06.021 --> 05:05:07.055
WHOEVER ELSE HAVE TO BE VERY

05:05:07.122 --> 05:05:08.423
SERIOUS.

05:05:08.490 --> 05:05:10.659
ABOUT HOW TO CREATE.

05:05:10.725 --> 05:05:11.192
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

05:05:11.259 --> 05:05:12.160
IMPLEMENTED.

05:05:12.227 --> 05:05:13.895
THAT CREATES SUCCESS.

05:05:13.962 --> 05:05:15.330
AND CONSIDERS THE HARDSHIP THAT

05:05:15.397 --> 05:05:17.365
IT CREATES FOR PARENTS YES IT IS

05:05:17.432 --> 05:05:18.767
A FACT THAT THE BRAIN SCIENCE IS

05:05:18.833 --> 05:05:20.135
GOOD FOR KIDS BUT WE HAVE TO

05:05:20.201 --> 05:05:21.036
ACKNOWLEDGE.

05:05:21.102 --> 05:05:22.270
THAT IT CREATES A HARDSHIP FOR

05:05:22.337 --> 05:05:26.074
FAMILIES FOR MANY.

05:05:26.141 --> 05:05:27.609
WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE

05:05:27.676 --> 05:05:28.843
WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATION WITH

05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:30.545
FAMILIES AND GETTING INPUT.

05:05:30.612 --> 05:05:31.146
FROM OUR FAMILIES AND IT IS A

05:05:31.212 --> 05:05:32.447
FACT.

05:05:32.514 --> 05:05:34.015
THAT SHOULD IT BE IMPLEMENTED

05:05:34.082 --> 05:05:36.017
THIS BILL WILL CREATE A HARDSHIP.

05:05:36.084 --> 05:05:36.651
FOR MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR

05:05:36.718 --> 05:05:38.019
STATE.

05:05:38.086 --> 05:05:41.056
UP SOME DISTRICTS WILL DO THIS.

05:05:41.122 --> 05:05:42.357
MUCH EASIER THAN OTHERS YOU

05:05:42.424 --> 05:05:43.625
HEARD EXAMPLES TODAY.

05:05:43.692 --> 05:05:44.626
FROM A FEW DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

05:05:44.693 --> 05:05:46.394
ALREADY DONE THIS.

05:05:46.461 --> 05:05:47.195
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS FOR MOST

05:05:47.262 --> 05:05:49.464
DISTRICTS [inaudible]

05:05:49.531 --> 05:05:51.132
THIS WILL.

05:05:51.199 --> 05:05:52.534
MEAN INCREASED COSTS THAT THEY

05:05:52.600 --> 05:05:53.768
HAVE NOT PLAN.

05:05:53.835 --> 05:05:55.970
FOR AND WILL NEED HELP. TO GET

05:05:56.037 --> 05:05:58.139
IT DONE IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY

05:05:58.206 --> 05:06:00.341
WILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR THAT HELP.

05:06:00.408 --> 05:06:02.110
IT'S FROM THIS CHAMBER.

05:06:02.177 --> 05:06:04.713
THE RED CHAMBER.

05:06:04.779 --> 05:06:06.648
IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THEY

05:06:06.715 --> 05:06:07.849
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

05:06:07.916 --> 05:06:10.018
THIS.

05:06:10.085 --> 05:06:11.286
USING THEIR LOCAL CONTROL

05:06:11.352 --> 05:06:12.620
FUNDING FORMULA OR ANY OTHER

05:06:12.687 --> 05:06:15.190
LOCAL DOLLARS.

05:06:15.256 --> 05:06:16.024
THEY WILL NEED HELP ON THIS

05:06:16.091 --> 05:06:17.125
LEGISLATURE AND FROM THIS AND

05:06:17.192 --> 05:06:18.593
FROM THE GOVERNOR. TO GET THIS

05:06:18.660 --> 05:06:21.029
DONE.

05:06:21.096 --> 05:06:24.566
SO HERE I AM A YEAR LATER.

05:06:24.632 --> 05:06:27.168
STILL WILLING TO VOTE.

05:06:27.235 --> 05:06:29.504
FOR STILL VERY CONFLICTED.

05:06:29.571 --> 05:06:30.572
BUT WANTING MEMBERS TO BE

05:06:30.638 --> 05:06:31.873
SERIOUS IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT

05:06:31.940 --> 05:06:33.608
YOU DO HERE TODAY.

05:06:33.675 --> 05:06:34.576
THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

05:06:34.642 --> 05:06:35.810
TRUE FACTS AND WE'VE GOT TO GIVE

05:06:35.877 --> 05:06:37.312
DISTRICTS SUPPORT.

05:06:37.378 --> 05:06:38.680
IT THIS MOVES FORWARD THIS

05:06:38.747 --> 05:06:40.415
CANNOT BE AN UNFUNDED MANDATE WE

05:06:40.482 --> 05:06:42.050
JUST EXPECTED TO WORK BECAUSE IF

05:06:42.117 --> 05:06:43.551
NOT WE DOOM.

05:06:43.618 --> 05:06:44.686
THE FAMILIES TO FAIL THE DISHES

05:06:44.753 --> 05:06:46.788
TO FAIL.

05:06:46.855 --> 05:06:49.124
AND POTENTIALLY THE KIDS TO FAIL

05:06:49.190 --> 05:06:49.424
[inaudible]

05:06:49.491 --> 05:06:54.729
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY.

05:06:54.796 --> 05:06:56.397
YEAH THANK YOU MEMBERS.

05:06:56.464 --> 05:06:57.632
I JUST OF FELT COMPELLED TO

05:06:57.699 --> 05:06:59.067
STAND.

05:06:59.134 --> 05:06:59.634
THE DEFENSE OF THE POSITION

05:06:59.701 --> 05:07:03.104
BECAUSE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO

05:07:03.171 --> 05:07:04.973
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO I DO

05:07:05.039 --> 05:07:05.673
NOT FEEL THAT THIS BASED ON

05:07:05.740 --> 05:07:07.442
IGNORANCE.

05:07:07.509 --> 05:07:08.777
I THINK THE BELIEVING IN LOCAL

05:07:08.843 --> 05:07:11.412
CONTROL IS A VERY POWERFUL.

05:07:11.479 --> 05:07:12.213
PIECE OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL

05:07:12.280 --> 05:07:14.048
GOVERNANCE.

05:07:14.115 --> 05:07:15.617
AND I BELIEVE HAVING BEEN A

05:07:15.683 --> 05:07:17.051
MEMBER THE SCHOOL BOARD WHICH IS

05:07:17.118 --> 05:07:18.153
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

THIS PARTICULAR DELICATE ISSUE.

05:58:34.526 --> 05:58:36.161
AND I THINK THAT --

05:58:36.228 --> 05:58:39.664
THIS BILL IS A VERY VERY CLOSE.

05:58:39.731 --> 05:58:41.099

05:58:48.673 --> 05:58:50.342
MINUTE.

05:58:50.408 --> 05:58:52.177

COMPLETELY THOUGHT OUT BY ALL

05:58:59.150 --> 05:59:00.318

05:59:02.020 --> 05:59:03.221
THERE ALSO WAS A GREAT NEED FOR

05:59:03.288 --> 05:59:04.956
THIS TYPE OF BILL.

05:59:05.023 --> 05:59:06.358
ADMITTEDLY THERE'S BEEN SOME

05:59:06.424 --> 05:59:07.359
VERY VERY FRUSTRATING

05:59:07.425 --> 05:59:09.361

05:59:16.301 --> 05:59:17.068

THIS PARTICULAR.

05:59:20.005 --> 05:59:22.307

TERM THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A LOT

05:59:40.725 --> 05:59:42.594

I THINK IT HAS [inaudible]

06:00:28.373 --> 06:00:30.241
CRITICAL LIMITATIONS I THINK IT

06:00:30.308 --> 06:00:31.609
WILL ALLOW WHERE THERE IS A

06:00:31.676 --> 06:00:33.345
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION YOU CAN

06:00:33.411 --> 06:00:34.980

06:00:36.314 --> 06:00:36.781

THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

06:00:38.984 --> 06:00:41.753
AND TO BE CLEAR IT ONLY APPLIES.

06:00:41.820 --> 06:00:43.288
THESE RECORDS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE

OR GREAT BODILY INJURY. THREE

06:00:56.668 --> 06:00:58.703
THE OFFICER WAS FOUND TO HAVE

06:00:58.770 --> 06:01:00.271
COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT ON

06:01:00.338 --> 06:01:01.873

06:01:01.940 --> 06:01:05.677

06:01:13.051 --> 06:01:15.487
MOST OFFICERS OUT THERE MOST LAW

ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS ARE

06:01:17.422 --> 06:01:19.557
HONEST HARD WORKING PEOPLE

06:01:19.624 --> 06:01:21.326

06:01:23.628 --> 06:01:27.298
BUT THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES.

06:01:27.365 --> 06:01:29.067
I THINK THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE

06:01:29.134 --> 06:01:30.235
PUBLIC TO ACCESS AND YOU KNOW

06:01:30.301 --> 06:01:32.370

ALWAYS IT'S OFTEN JUSTIFIED.

06:01:45.650 --> 06:01:48.920
AND THAT SHOULD COME OUT.

06:01:48.987 --> 06:01:50.855
THE THE INVESTIGATION THAT

06:01:50.922 --> 06:01:52.857
CLEARS THE OFFICER THAT WAS

06:01:52.924 --> 06:01:55.293

06:01:55.360 --> 06:01:56.394

06:31:09.112 --> 06:31:10.213
DEVASTATED LOW INCOME

06:31:10.280 --> 06:31:13.349
COMMUNITIES SOMEHOW THE CURE FOR

06:31:13.416 --> 06:31:16.586
BIAS ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE.

06:31:16.653 --> 06:31:18.521
WE SHOULD FIND REASONABLE

06:31:18.588 --> 06:31:20.590
INCREMENTAL BILLS LIKE THIS ONE

06:31:20.657 --> 06:31:22.592
TO HELP ON WINE THE LEGACY OF

06:31:22.659 --> 06:31:24.761
MASS INCARCERATION AND THE

06:31:24.828 --> 06:31:26.162
MISTAKES OF PRIOR GENERATIONS OF

06:31:26.229 --> 06:31:28.064
LEGISLATORS.

06:31:28.131 --> 06:31:29.632
THESE PRIOR GENERATIONS OF

06:31:29.699 --> 06:31:31.334
LAWMAKERS WERE NOT AS DIVERSE AS

06:31:31.401 --> 06:31:33.303
WE ARE NOW.

06:31:33.369 --> 06:31:34.938
THERE WERE FEWER WOMEN IN THERE

06:31:35.004 --> 06:31:36.773
WERE FEWER PEOPLE OF COLOR THERE

06:31:36.840 --> 06:31:39.442
WAS NOT AN OUT LGBTQ MEMBER

06:31:39.509 --> 06:31:42.779
UNTIL SENATOR SHEILA KEWL IN.

06:31:42.846 --> 06:31:43.813
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WAS

06:31:43.880 --> 06:31:45.181
NOT ONE INDIAN AMERICAN MEMBER

06:31:45.248 --> 06:31:46.583
UNTIL TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN

06:31:46.649 --> 06:31:47.550
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA WAS

06:31:47.617 --> 06:31:49.152
ELECTED.

06:31:49.219 --> 06:31:50.887
LAWMAKERS IN THE NINETEEN

06:31:50.954 --> 06:31:52.422
EIGHTIES WERE LESS DIVERSE AND

06:31:52.488 --> 06:31:53.857
DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE WEALTH

06:31:53.923 --> 06:31:56.559
OF RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TODAY

06:31:56.626 --> 06:31:58.661
TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF GET

06:31:58.728 --> 06:32:00.563
TOUGH ON CRIME POLICIES.

06:32:00.630 --> 06:32:02.832
SO IT FALLS ON US TO ADDRESS THE

06:32:02.899 --> 06:32:05.034
BIASES AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF

06:32:05.101 --> 06:32:06.669
THOSE PRIOR GENERATIONS OF

06:32:06.736 --> 06:32:08.605

AGO THE COMET WAS MAY ON THE

06:32:39.769 --> 06:32:42.805
OTHER SIDE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE

06:32:42.872 --> 06:32:43.940
THE JUDGES THE DISCRETION.

06:32:44.007 --> 06:32:45.275
BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE WAS DOING

06:32:45.341 --> 06:32:46.209
SOME OTHER THINGS AND WE SAID

06:32:46.276 --> 06:32:48.177
WAIT A MINUTE WE WERE MOVING IN

06:32:48.244 --> 06:32:49.612
A DIRECTION OF JUDGE DISCRETION.

06:32:49.679 --> 06:32:51.114
AND THAT IS TRUE AND THAT'S WHAT

06:32:51.180 --> 06:32:52.315
THIS BILL DOES IT DOES NOT

06:32:52.382 --> 06:32:54.250
ELIMINATE ENHANCEMENTS.

06:32:54.317 --> 06:32:56.019
IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ALL THE

06:32:56.085 --> 06:32:57.053
OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO

06:32:57.120 --> 06:32:59.522
DO BUT IT SAYS THAT IN THE END.

06:32:59.589 --> 06:33:01.124
IT JUDGE SHOULD HAVE THE

06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:03.293
DECISION A A TO DO ACCEPT OR

06:33:03.359 --> 06:33:05.261
REJECT THE ENHANCEMENT THAT IS

06:33:05.328 --> 06:33:06.663
BEING RECOMMENDED BASED ON THE

06:33:06.729 --> 06:33:08.164
CIRCUMSTANCES AS THERE.

06:33:08.231 --> 06:33:09.032
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER

06:33:09.098 --> 06:33:10.066
BEEN IN A COURTROOM AND YOU'VE

06:33:10.133 --> 06:33:12.335
SEEN WHAT HAPPENS IS ALMOST AS

06:33:12.402 --> 06:33:14.070
LIKE A MATH GAME THERE'S THREE

06:33:14.137 --> 06:33:16.139
PUT THIS THIS FOR FOR THAT THIS

06:33:16.205 --> 06:33:16.572
FIVE WITH THI THAT.

06:33:16.639 --> 06:33:18.508
AND I'M JUST BUT NO WOULDN'T AND

06:33:18.574 --> 06:33:19.342
I WAS IN ONE COURT ROOM WHERE

06:33:19.409 --> 06:33:20.643
SOMEONE HAD A CALCULATOR AND

06:33:20.710 --> 06:33:22.045
THEY WERE ACTUALLY CALCULATING

06:33:22.111 --> 06:33:24.080
THE YEARS OR HOW MUCH TIME A

06:33:24.147 --> 06:33:25.748
PERSON HAVE TO SERVE IN THE NECK

06:33:25.815 --> 06:33:27.016
AT SUBTRACT TWO YEARS FOR THIS

06:33:27.083 --> 06:33:27.717
OF I MEAN.

06:33:27.784 --> 06:33:30.386
THE THE CONCEPT OF JUDGING AND

06:33:30.453 --> 06:33:32.088
JUDICIAL DISCRETION HAS BEEN

06:33:32.155 --> 06:33:33.623
TAKEN OUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE

06:33:33.690 --> 06:33:35.291
MATH AND WE GIVE THEM IN TERMS

06:33:35.358 --> 06:33:36.092
OF HOW YOU.

06:33:36.159 --> 06:33:38.161
CALCULATE WHO DESERVES TO SPEND

06:33:38.227 --> 06:33:40.163
MORE TIME AND WHO DOES NOT SO I

06:33:40.229 --> 06:33:41.731
THINK IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT

06:33:41.798 --> 06:33:42.966
THAT IF WE GO BACK AND SAY TO

06:33:43.032 --> 06:33:44.334
OURSELVES AS WE SAID A FEW

06:33:44.400 --> 06:33:45.234
MINUTES AGO AGAINST THE OTHER

06:33:45.301 --> 06:33:45.835

06:33:45.902 --> 06:33:47.136

06:33:49.238 --> 06:33:51.007
SOME DISCRETION.

06:33:51.074 --> 06:33:52.342
EVERYONE ELSE STILL HAS THE

06:33:52.408 --> 06:33:54.310
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE THE

06:33:54.377 --> 06:33:56.512
SENTENCING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

06:33:56.579 --> 06:33:57.413
TO A BASICALLY ASK FOR

06:33:57.480 --> 06:33:59.582
ENHANCEMENTS ALL THAT IS THERE

06:33:59.649 --> 06:34:01.184
BUT RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS A

06:34:01.250 --> 06:34:02.819
JUDGE CANNOT.

06:34:02.885 --> 06:34:04.187
CANNOT REMOVE AN ENHANCEMENT

06:34:04.253 --> 06:34:05.388
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT HE

06:34:05.455 --> 06:34:06.856
SHOULD HAVE THAT DISCRETION OR

06:34:06.923 --> 06:34:08.124

CASE.

06:34:10.426 --> 06:34:12.195
WE SHOULD DO TEN YEARS OF

06:34:12.261 --> 06:34:13.663
ENHANCEMENT BUT WE SHOULD DO

06:34:13.730 --> 06:34:14.731

06:34:14.797 --> 06:34:15.898
ENHANCEMENT BASED ON SPECIAL

06:34:15.965 --> 06:34:18.034
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS GIVES A JUDGE

06:34:18.101 --> 06:34:20.036
SOME DISCRETION TO BASICALLY

06:34:20.103 --> 06:34:21.838

WE SAY GOODBYE TO HIM TODAY.

06:52:28.323 --> 06:52:30.826
THE REASON HE SAID THIS.

06:52:30.892 --> 06:52:34.129
IS A TESTAMENT TO HIS CHARACTER.

06:52:34.196 --> 06:52:37.032

06:54:03.084 --> 06:54:03.852
I'M GONNA SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

06:54:03.919 --> 06:54:05.554

BEEN REPEATED.

06:54:09.257 --> 06:54:10.792

ALL OF YOU I'M HAVE HAVE SAID.

07:21:36.770 --> 07:21:37.737
THE ONE THING OF COURSE THAT

07:21:37.804 --> 07:21:39.039
STICKS OUT IS THAT HE IS A

07:21:39.105 --> 07:21:41.041
MARINE.

07:21:41.107 --> 07:21:43.243
AND THAT HE WAS A COLONEL IN THE

07:21:43.310 --> 07:21:44.878
MARINE CORPS AND YOU DON'T GET

07:21:44.945 --> 07:21:46.479
TO THE RANK OF COLONEL.

07:21:46.546 --> 07:21:48.415
WITHOUT BEING HAVING INCREDIBLE

07:21:48.481 --> 07:21:49.950

07:21:50.016 --> 07:21:51.785
PRESENCE.

07:21:51.852 --> 07:21:55.856

07:21:55.922 --> 07:21:58.758
THE FINE MARINES A SIMPLIFY

07:21:58.825 --> 07:21:59.059

07:22:03.663 --> 07:22:04.297
LEADER.

07:22:04.364 --> 07:22:07.467
IRAQI WAS WAS ALWAYS FAITHFUL

07:22:07.534 --> 07:22:09.269
AND HE WAS ALWAYS LOYAL.

07:22:09.336 --> 07:22:09.903
AND IF WE ARE GOING DOWN A PATH

07:22:09.970 --> 07:22:10.203
[inaudible]

07:22:10.270 --> 07:22:13.306
IF HE WOULD ARGUE WITH ME DEBATE

07:22:13.373 --> 07:22:14.074
WITH ME WHETHER WAS THE RIGHT

07:22:14.140 --> 07:22:16.476
PATH BUT ONCE THAT PATH WAS SET.

07:22:16.543 --> 07:22:18.812
HE STOOD RIGHT NEXT TO ME AND

07:22:18.879 --> 07:22:20.814
CONTINUED TO KEEP FIGHTING THAT

07:22:20.881 --> 07:22:23.283
FIGHT.

07:22:23.350 --> 07:22:25.018
AND AS WE KNOW.

07:22:25.085 --> 07:22:26.019
THERE WAS OUT THERE'S BEEN A FEW

07:22:26.086 --> 07:22:28.255
TOUGH VOTES --

07:22:28.321 --> 07:22:30.223

07:22:36.763 --> 07:22:38.398
DO.

07:22:38.465 --> 07:22:40.901
HE WAS GONNA DO IT.

07:22:40.967 --> 07:22:41.735
IN YOU KNOW MARINES HAVE THAT

07:22:41.801 --> 07:22:43.103

IN MY CAREER THAT I'VE BEEN

08:06:31.061 --> 08:06:33.531
AROUND [inaudible]

08:06:33.597 --> 08:06:35.599
THERE'S ALWAYS.

08:06:35.666 --> 08:06:36.567
BIG PERSONALITIES IN THIS

08:06:36.634 --> 08:06:39.036
BUILDING.

08:06:39.103 --> 08:06:40.070
THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE WERE SORT

08:06:40.137 --> 08:06:41.772
OF IN THE MIDDLE.

AND YET THIS IS THIS GREEN

08:06:46.644 --> 08:06:48.145
CARPET.

08:06:48.212 --> 08:06:50.581

08:07:00.925 --> 08:07:04.862
AND I THINK --

08:07:04.929 --> 08:07:06.864
WE'RE IN AN ERA CERTAINLY WIN

08:07:06.931 --> 08:07:08.165

08:07:09.733 --> 08:07:12.436
BEING TEST.

08:07:12.503 --> 08:07:13.971
AND WHAT IS MOST ASSUREDLY IS A

08:07:14.038 --> 08:07:17.141
TIME IN WHICH PEOPLE COME

08:07:17.207 --> 08:07:19.577

MISTER SPEAKER I WAS ACTUALLY

11:16:59.946 --> 11:17:02.248
NOT.

11:17:02.315 --> 11:17:03.716
THE BILL TODAY BUT AFTER READING

11:17:03.783 --> 11:17:06.218
THE BILL IN BEING VERY CONCERNED.

11:17:06.285 --> 11:17:08.020
ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THE BILL I

11:17:08.087 --> 11:17:10.056
WANTED -- TO

11:17:10.122 --> 11:17:12.091
ADDRESS YOU AND TOP TELL YOU

11:17:12.158 --> 11:17:13.259
ABOUT SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS

11:17:13.326 --> 11:17:14.593
I'VE HAD WITH THE BILL'S AUTHOR

11:17:14.660 --> 11:17:15.828
WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP IN

11:17:15.895 --> 11:17:17.163
COMMITTEE I HEARD AND COMMITTEE.

11:17:17.229 --> 11:17:18.664
AND HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

11:17:18.731 --> 11:17:20.700
BILL. FOR ONE THING THE GOALS OF

11:17:20.766 --> 11:17:22.668
THIS BILL ARE EXTREMELY

11:17:22.735 --> 11:17:24.937
MERITORIOUS YOU KNOW I HAVE A

11:17:25.004 --> 11:17:27.239
YOUNG DAUGHTER AND I WORRY EVERY

11:17:27.306 --> 11:17:29.508
DAY THAT I WILL ONE DAY HAVE TO

11:17:29.575 --> 11:17:31.344
TELL HER THAT THOSE BEAUTIFUL

11:17:31.410 --> 11:17:33.112
ANIMALS THAT SEE SEASON BOOKS.

11:17:33.179 --> 11:17:35.147
DON'T EXIST ANY LONGER.

11:17:35.214 --> 11:17:35.781
BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THEM IN THE

11:17:35.848 --> 11:17:37.516
WILD THAT MAYBE THERE'S ONE OR

11:17:37.583 --> 11:17:38.884
TWO LEFT IN ZOOS BUT THEY ARE

11:17:38.951 --> 11:17:40.720
ALL PRACTICALLY. FOR ALL

11:17:40.786 --> 11:17:42.154
INTENSIVE PURPOSES OFF THE

11:17:42.221 --> 11:17:43.789
PLANET THAT MIGHT SEEM.

11:17:43.856 --> 11:17:45.191
FAR FETCHED BUT THAT'S HAPPENING

11:17:45.257 --> 11:17:46.625
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF POACHING

11:17:46.692 --> 11:17:48.427
RIGHT NOW.

11:17:48.494 --> 11:17:49.528
BUT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE BILL

11:17:49.595 --> 11:17:50.629
AND THE REASON I WAS WORRIED IS

11:17:50.696 --> 11:17:51.597
BECAUSE OF SOME OF YOU DON'T

11:17:51.664 --> 11:17:53.299
KNOW THIS BUT AFTER I HAD MY

11:17:53.366 --> 11:17:54.400
CAREER IN THE FILM INDUSTRY I

11:17:54.467 --> 11:17:55.868
BECAME AN ANTIQUES DEALER.

11:17:55.935 --> 11:17:57.603
AND ICE THE DEAL IN ANTIQUE

11:17:57.670 --> 11:17:58.871
INVENTED STORY.

11:17:58.938 --> 11:18:00.706
AND SOME OF THAT VINTAGE STORY

11:18:00.773 --> 11:18:01.974
IN FACT QUITE A LOT OF IT

11:18:02.041 --> 11:18:03.943
OCCASIONALLY WILL HAVE IVORY AND

11:18:04.010 --> 11:18:05.511
OTHER TYPES OF MATERIAL AND

11:18:05.578 --> 11:18:08.014
BECAUSE THE BILL BANS POSSESSION.

11:18:08.080 --> 11:18:09.548
I WAS AFRAID ABOUT WHAT WOULD

11:18:09.615 --> 11:18:11.183
HAPPEN.

11:18:11.250 --> 11:18:13.953
IF SOMEBODY IF SOME OVERZEALOUS

11:18:14.020 --> 11:18:15.721
PROSECUTOR STARTED TO GO AFTER.

11:18:15.788 --> 11:18:16.522
SOMEONE FOR THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S

11:18:16.589 --> 11:18:18.357
BROOCH.

11:18:18.424 --> 11:18:19.525
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

11:18:19.592 --> 11:18:20.793
THAT WASN'T THE INTENT OF THE

11:18:20.860 --> 11:18:21.427
BILL AND THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN IN

11:18:21.494 --> 11:18:22.795
THE BILL.

11:18:22.862 --> 11:18:23.763
BUT I ALSO DIDN'T WANT A

11:18:23.829 --> 11:18:25.398
SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO

11:18:25.464 --> 11:18:26.932
PROVE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAD.

11:18:26.999 --> 11:18:28.968
OWNED A PIANO WITH IVORY KEYS

11:18:29.035 --> 11:18:30.936
FOR TWENTY YEARS OR THIRTY YEARS.

11:18:31.003 --> 11:18:32.605
I HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION SAY

11:18:32.671 --> 11:18:33.706
WITH THE BILL'S ADVOCATES IN THE

11:18:33.773 --> 11:18:35.207
BILL'S AUTHOR THAT CERTAINLY

11:18:35.274 --> 11:18:36.809
WASN'T ITS INTENT AND HE WAS

11:18:36.876 --> 11:18:38.778
WILLING TO PUT A LETTER INTO THE

11:18:38.844 --> 11:18:41.247
FILE WHICH HE DID. TO CLARIFY

11:18:41.313 --> 11:18:43.783
THAT NUMBER ONE IT WOULD BE IT

11:18:43.849 --> 11:18:45.551
WAS HIS INTENT THAT THE AND

11:18:45.618 --> 11:18:47.119
BURDEN OF PROOF WOULD BE ON THE

11:18:47.186 --> 11:18:50.623
PROSECUTORS ON THOSE WHO WANT.

11:18:50.689 --> 11:18:52.024
TO REST PRESS CHARGES AGAINST

11:18:52.091 --> 11:18:53.726
SOMEONE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVE.

11:18:53.793 --> 11:18:55.461
THAT THE ITEM WAS NOT OWNED FOR

11:18:55.528 --> 11:18:58.397
MANY YEARS AND SECONDLY IT WAS

11:18:58.464 --> 11:18:59.465
ALSO NOT AS INTENT TO HAVE

11:18:59.532 --> 11:19:00.966
PROSECUTION OVER DIMINISH THIS

11:19:01.033 --> 11:19:02.468
SMALL AMOUNTS OF THE MATERIAL

11:19:02.535 --> 11:19:03.736
SUCH AS YOU WOULD FIND IN

11:19:03.803 --> 11:19:05.771
VINTAGE JEWELRY.

11:19:05.838 --> 11:19:07.506
THAT LETTER IS NOW IN THE FILE

11:19:07.573 --> 11:19:08.641
AND NEXT YEAR I'M COMMITTED TO

11:19:08.707 --> 11:19:11.477
DOING A BILL TO CLARIFY THIS.

11:19:11.544 --> 11:19:13.012
SO THAT THE LAW IS A LITTLE BIT

11:19:13.079 --> 11:19:14.580
CLEARER AND DOESN'T LEAD TO THE

11:19:14.647 --> 11:19:17.049
OVERZEALOUS PROSECUTION OF SOME.

11:19:17.116 --> 11:19:18.451
ANTIQUE MALL OWNER WHO HAS A

11:19:18.517 --> 11:19:19.919
TEENY PIECE OF JEWELRY IN A

11:19:19.985 --> 11:19:21.220
SHOWCASE BUT CERTAINLY NOT AN

11:19:21.287 --> 11:19:22.922
IMPORTER OR SOMEONE WHO EVEN

11:19:22.988 --> 11:19:24.223
WOULD KNOWINGLY PUT THIS

11:19:24.290 --> 11:19:25.791
MATERIAL OUT FOR SALE.

11:19:25.858 --> 11:19:27.059
WITHOUT I'M VERY COMFORTABLE

11:19:27.126 --> 11:19:28.127
WITH THE BILL RITE NOW AND I

11:19:28.194 --> 11:19:29.328
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE

11:19:29.395 --> 11:19:31.197
TIME IS RUNNING OUT. FOR THESE

11:19:31.263 --> 11:19:33.132
AMAZING AN ENDANGERED ANIMALS

11:19:33.199 --> 11:19:36.202
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:19:36.268 --> 11:19:37.837
BIG IS FRIEDMAN MISTER GALLAGHER

11:19:37.903 --> 11:19:39.271
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU

11:19:39.338 --> 11:19:41.841
MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS.

11:19:41.907 --> 11:19:45.144
SO I WANTED TO RISE BECAUSE I I

11:19:45.211 --> 11:19:48.647
SHARE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS --

11:19:48.714 --> 11:19:49.849
THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM

11:19:49.915 --> 11:19:54.854
GLENDALE THAT HAS POINTED OUT --

11:19:54.920 --> 11:19:56.122
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS

11:19:56.188 --> 11:19:56.989
OBVIOUSLY A VERY WELL

11:19:57.056 --> 11:19:58.724
INTENTIONED.

11:19:58.791 --> 11:19:59.859
ONE AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN

11:19:59.925 --> 11:20:01.026
THIS ROOM WOULD PROBABLY AGREE

11:20:01.093 --> 11:20:02.761
WITH THAT INTENTION.

11:20:02.828 --> 11:20:06.031
THE ISSUE IS ABOUT HOW BROAD.

11:20:06.098 --> 11:20:07.800
THIS THIS BILL REACHES

11:20:07.867 --> 11:20:08.100
[inaudible]

11:20:08.167 --> 11:20:10.970
AND THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE

11:20:11.036 --> 11:20:11.804
COMMENTS --

11:20:11.871 --> 11:20:14.673
FROM MY COLLEAGUE.

11:20:14.740 --> 11:20:15.841
A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL DOES IT

11:20:15.908 --> 11:20:17.276
REALLY DO THAT.

11:20:17.343 --> 11:20:18.644
AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS

11:20:18.711 --> 11:20:19.645
COULD GO AFTER PEOPLE

11:20:19.712 --> 11:20:21.280
RETROACTIVELY COULD GO AFTER

11:20:21.347 --> 11:20:22.114
PEOPLE.

11:20:22.181 --> 11:20:23.616
WHO MAY BE IN POSSESSION OF

11:20:23.682 --> 11:20:26.452
JEWELRY OR SOME OR A BROOCH OR

11:20:26.519 --> 11:20:27.653
SOME KIND OF THING THAT COULD BE

11:20:27.720 --> 11:20:28.988
CONSIDERED?

11:20:29.054 --> 11:20:30.589
UNDER THIS BILL AND FACE

11:20:30.656 --> 11:20:32.625
PROSECUTION.

11:20:32.691 --> 11:20:35.828
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S JUST.

11:20:35.895 --> 11:20:36.495
AND THE OTHER POINT THAT I WOULD

11:20:36.562 --> 11:20:38.364
BRING UP THAT I THINK IS OFTEN

11:20:38.430 --> 11:20:39.899
LOST IN THIS DISCUSSION

11:20:39.965 --> 11:20:40.199
[inaudible]

11:20:40.266 --> 11:20:42.334
IS.

11:20:42.401 --> 11:20:44.637
THAT MANY OF THE HUNTERS.

11:20:44.703 --> 11:20:46.238
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR THE

11:20:46.305 --> 11:20:47.940
GREATEST CONTRIBUTORS TO

11:20:48.007 --> 11:20:50.242
CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN AFRICA

11:20:50.309 --> 11:20:51.110
THAT ARE PROTECTING THE SPECIES

11:20:51.177 --> 11:20:53.879
TODAY.

11:20:53.946 --> 11:20:54.647
AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

11:20:54.713 --> 11:20:56.248
GROUPS LIKE SAFARI CLUB

11:20:56.315 --> 11:20:58.284
INTERNATIONAL YOU TALK ABOUT

11:20:58.350 --> 11:21:00.152
MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS WHO.

11:21:00.219 --> 11:21:02.188
WHO ARE HUNTERS?

11:21:02.254 --> 11:21:03.355
BUT WHO ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

11:21:03.422 --> 11:21:05.257
THEY'RE NOT POACHERS THE BIGGEST

11:21:05.324 --> 11:21:06.759
PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WITH POACHERS

11:21:06.825 --> 11:21:07.326
THAT'S WHO WE HAVE A PROBLEM

11:21:07.393 --> 11:21:09.195
WITH.

11:21:09.261 --> 11:21:10.496
AND WHO ARE LEADING TOO THE

11:21:10.563 --> 11:21:12.731
DECIMATION OF SPECIES.

11:21:12.798 --> 11:21:14.233
IT'S NOT WITH RESPONSIBLE

11:21:14.300 --> 11:21:15.334
HUNTERS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE

11:21:15.401 --> 11:21:16.068
CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN ANYONE

11:21:16.135 --> 11:21:18.938
ELSE. TO THE CONSERVATION OF THE

11:21:19.004 --> 11:21:20.339
SPECIES [inaudible]

11:21:20.406 --> 11:21:21.941
AND SO.

11:21:22.007 --> 11:21:24.376
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

11:21:24.443 --> 11:21:28.547
AND AS WELL AS NOT EVERY SPECIES.

11:21:28.614 --> 11:21:30.216
UNDER THIS BILL IS A THREATENED

11:21:30.282 --> 11:21:32.051
SPECIES SO AGAIN THE THE ALL THE

11:21:32.117 --> 11:21:32.985
SPECIES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS

11:21:33.052 --> 11:21:35.387
BILL.

11:21:35.454 --> 11:21:36.889
IS NOT TARGETING THE MOST

11:21:36.956 --> 11:21:38.390
ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT WE'RE

11:21:38.457 --> 11:21:39.758
TALKING ABOUT SO AGAIN I THINK

11:21:39.825 --> 11:21:40.859
THAT THAT WE NEED SOME MORE WORK

11:21:40.926 --> 11:21:42.161
ON THIS BILL IT CAN WAIT TILL

11:21:42.228 --> 11:21:43.596
NEXT YEAR.

11:21:43.662 --> 11:21:44.863
AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE SO

11:21:44.930 --> 11:21:46.098
THAT WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT IN

11:21:46.165 --> 11:21:46.665
THE NEXT SESSION [inaudible]

11:21:46.732 --> 11:21:49.034

OF THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM

I AM I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

11:22:07.586 --> 11:22:09.021
BILL THIS EVENING BUT I DO THINK

11:22:09.088 --> 11:22:10.356
THAT IT ACTUALLY.

11:22:10.422 --> 11:22:12.291

11:22:12.358 --> 11:22:14.026

NINE OF THEM ARE --

11:22:17.930 --> 11:22:19.732
THREATENED AND I THINK ITS

11:22:19.798 --> 11:22:21.066
IMPORTANT FOR US FOR THE SHORT

11:22:21.133 --> 11:22:22.468
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE'VE GOT TO

11:22:22.534 --> 11:22:23.535

11:22:25.771 --> 11:22:28.440
WE CAN A TO BE ABLE --

11:22:28.507 --> 11:22:29.575
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

11:22:29.642 --> 11:22:30.609
KILLING ANIMALS THEY SHOULDN'T

THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR

12:39:37.164 --> 12:39:38.199
LIABILITY.

12:39:38.266 --> 12:39:40.701
THAT HAS BEEN A DRIVING FORCE OF

12:39:40.768 --> 12:39:44.205
CONVERSATION TO BEGIN THIS YEAR.

12:39:44.272 --> 12:39:45.673
WHEN WE STARTED THIS YEAR?

12:39:45.740 --> 12:39:47.675
WE HAD A NUMBER OF UTILITIES

12:39:47.742 --> 12:39:48.209
ACTUALLY ALL THE UTILITIES

12:39:48.276 --> 12:39:49.443
PRIVATE.

12:39:49.510 --> 12:39:50.645

12:39:55.416 --> 12:39:56.984
THE FIRE WAS HAVING ON THEIR

12:39:57.051 --> 12:39:58.185
OPERATIONS ON THE POTENTIAL

12:40:01.789 --> 12:40:05.059
CONTINUE TO OPERATE.

12:40:05.126 --> 12:40:06.427
AND AS WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH

12:40:06.494 --> 12:40:07.495
HEARING A LOT OF THE KIND OF

12:40:07.561 --> 12:40:09.397
COMPLICATED ISSUES AND THINGS

12:40:09.463 --> 12:40:11.632
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE.

12:40:11.699 --> 12:40:13.134
IT KIND OF BOIL DOWN TO THE

12:40:13.200 --> 12:40:14.969
POINT WHERE THIS LEGISLATIVE

12:40:15.036 --> 12:40:17.004

12:40:23.277 --> 12:40:25.279
FEARS.

12:40:25.346 --> 12:40:27.615
BUT IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT

12:40:27.682 --> 12:40:29.083
THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY NEEDED TO

12:40:29.150 --> 12:40:30.785
GET ITS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND.

12:40:30.851 --> 12:40:32.486
THIS IN A VERY [inaudible]

12:40:32.553 --> 12:40:34.855
DRAMATIC WAY.

12:40:34.922 --> 12:40:36.257
AND SO THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

12:40:36.324 --> 12:40:37.658
WAS ESTABLISHED BY BOTH HOUSES

12:40:37.725 --> 12:40:39.794

STABILIZE UTILITY IN THE MARKET

12:40:53.341 --> 12:40:55.242

12:41:07.588 --> 12:41:08.823
THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPORT

12:41:08.889 --> 12:41:10.524

12:41:36.450 --> 12:41:37.585
IT'S CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT

12:41:37.651 --> 12:41:39.020
NOTHING IN THE REPORT WILL

12:41:39.086 --> 12:41:40.287
CHANGE THE TRIAL COURT

12:49:09.803 --> 12:49:10.304
I DON'T WANT TO SEE FUTURE

12:49:10.370 --> 12:49:12.906
VICTIMS AND THAT'S WHY HAVE

12:49:12.973 --> 12:49:14.208
FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE VEGETATION

12:49:14.274 --> 12:49:16.143
MANAGEMENT.

12:49:16.210 --> 12:49:17.411
I THINK MOST OF THE CONVERSATION

12:49:17.478 --> 12:49:19.012
HERE TONIGHT.

12:49:19.079 --> 12:49:20.747
IS ABOUT WHETHER THE CONFERENCE

12:49:20.814 --> 12:49:22.516
COMMITTEE STRUCK THE RIGHT

12:49:22.583 --> 12:49:25.652
BALANCE AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE.

12:49:25.719 --> 12:49:27.154
BUT I DO LINE IN THE SAND WHEN I

12:49:27.221 --> 12:49:28.689
SAID WE NEEDED TO PUT PEOPLE

12:49:28.755 --> 12:49:29.656
FIRST.

12:49:29.723 --> 12:49:31.758
AND BY THAT I MEAN VICTIMS.

12:49:31.825 --> 12:49:32.693
AND THOSE WHO MIGHT BECOME

12:49:32.759 --> 12:49:34.194
VICTIMS IN THE FUTURE.

12:49:34.261 --> 12:49:36.129
BUT PREVENTION HAD TO BE A PART

12:49:36.196 --> 12:49:38.599
OF THE OVERALL SOLUTION. TO ME

12:49:38.665 --> 12:49:40.300
THAT MEANS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

12:49:40.367 --> 12:49:41.735
AND RESOURCES FOR OUR FIRST

12:49:41.802 --> 12:49:44.104
RESPONDERS OUR FIREFIGHTERS.

12:49:44.171 --> 12:49:45.772
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS

12:49:45.839 --> 12:49:48.041
PACKAGE DEDICATES ONE BILLION

12:49:48.108 --> 12:49:50.077
DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS.

12:49:50.143 --> 12:49:51.478
EACH YEAR THAT MEANS A HUNDRED

12:49:51.545 --> 12:49:53.547
AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

12:49:53.614 --> 12:49:54.047
FOR EFFECTIVE VEGETATION

12:49:54.114 --> 12:49:55.415
MANAGEMENT.

12:49:55.482 --> 12:49:57.684
FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND

12:49:57.751 --> 12:49:58.452
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

12:49:58.519 --> 12:50:00.020
PER FRIES PRESCRIBE FUEL AND

12:50:00.087 --> 12:50:02.689
FUEL REDUCTION PROGRAMS.

12:50:02.756 --> 12:50:04.291
THERE IS ALSO FUNDING TO ALLOW

12:50:04.358 --> 12:50:06.994
FIREFIGHTERS TO PRE POSITION IN

12:50:07.060 --> 12:50:08.729
ORDER TO BETTER RESPOND TO FIRE.

12:50:08.795 --> 12:50:09.596
AND DIRECTION FIRE SIZE AND

12:50:09.663 --> 12:50:11.899
DIRECTION.

12:50:11.965 --> 12:50:12.966
THIS REPRESENTS WOULD THE

12:50:13.033 --> 12:50:14.601
LARGEST COMMITMENTS TO FIRE

12:50:14.668 --> 12:50:15.402
PREVENTION IN THE STATE'S

12:50:15.469 --> 12:50:17.371
HISTORY AND IN MY OPINION IT'S

12:50:17.437 --> 12:50:19.540
LONG OVERDUE.

12:50:19.606 --> 12:50:20.807
ADDITIONALLY THE VEGETATION

12:50:20.874 --> 12:50:22.376
MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN THIS BILL

12:50:22.442 --> 12:50:24.177
WILL ENCOURAGE LOCAL COMMUNITIES

12:50:24.244 --> 12:50:26.146
TO BETTER PLAN FOR WILDFIRE AND

12:50:26.213 --> 12:50:27.915
MAKE IT EASIER FOR LANDOWNERS TO

12:50:27.981 --> 12:50:29.016
CONDUCT FUEL REDUCTION ON THEIR

12:50:29.082 --> 12:50:30.517
OWN LAND.

12:50:30.584 --> 12:50:31.818
SPECIALLY LA SMALL SMALL

12:50:31.885 --> 12:50:34.488
LANDOWNERS.

12:50:34.555 --> 12:50:36.423
I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE PACKAGE

12:50:36.490 --> 12:50:37.758
STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE

12:50:37.824 --> 12:50:39.326
BETWEEN MAKING VEGETATION

12:50:39.393 --> 12:50:40.627
MANAGEMENT AFFORDABLE.

12:50:40.694 --> 12:50:41.962
AND PROTECTING OUR NATURAL

12:50:42.029 --> 12:50:43.397
RESOURCES BUT MAKE MAKE NO

12:50:43.463 --> 12:50:45.632
MISTAKE.

12:50:45.699 --> 12:50:46.633
AS A PROUD ENVIRONMENTALISTS I

12:50:46.700 --> 12:50:48.535
WILL WORK CLOSELY.

12:50:48.602 --> 12:50:52.673
I WON'T TOLERATE ABUSES.

12:50:52.739 --> 12:50:54.107
IN CLOSING WE CAN'T STOP THE

12:50:54.174 --> 12:50:55.509
SEVERITY THESE WILDFIRES WITHOUT

12:50:55.576 --> 12:50:57.578
DEALING WITH THE CAUSES.

12:50:57.644 --> 12:50:59.046
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT

12:50:59.112 --> 12:51:00.881
AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE.

12:51:00.948 --> 12:51:01.982
CAN REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF THE

12:51:02.049 --> 12:51:03.517
FIRES.

12:51:03.584 --> 12:51:05.686
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ONE MAJOR

12:51:05.752 --> 12:51:07.688
FIRE OFFSETS ALMOST EVERYTHING

12:51:07.754 --> 12:51:09.690
THE STATE DOES.

12:51:09.756 --> 12:51:11.158
WHEN WE GO TO TO TRY TO REDUCE

12:51:11.224 --> 12:51:12.059
CARBON EMISSIONS ON A YEARLY

12:51:12.125 --> 12:51:15.529
BASIS?

12:51:15.596 --> 12:51:16.129
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION

12:51:16.196 --> 12:51:17.497
COLLEAGUES AND I RESPECTFULLY

12:51:17.564 --> 12:51:19.733
ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

12:51:19.800 --> 12:51:24.605
THEY COULD ACT WOULD MISS LEVINE.

12:51:24.671 --> 12:51:26.206
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND

12:51:26.273 --> 12:51:27.674
MEMBERS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE

12:51:27.741 --> 12:51:28.642
THE EFFORT.

12:51:28.709 --> 12:51:30.177
OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BUT

12:51:30.243 --> 12:51:31.945
I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO

12:51:32.012 --> 12:51:33.914
THIS BILL.

12:51:33.981 --> 12:51:35.415
WELL THERE ARE IMPAIR MANY

12:51:35.482 --> 12:51:36.950
COMMENDABLE PROVISIONS REGARDING

12:51:37.017 --> 12:51:38.552
FIRE PREVENTION.

12:51:38.619 --> 12:51:39.586
INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE

12:51:39.653 --> 12:51:40.821
IMPROVEMENTS IN BETTER

12:51:40.887 --> 12:51:42.489
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

12:51:42.556 --> 12:51:45.525
THIS DID NOT NEED TO BE JOINED

12:51:45.592 --> 12:51:47.794
TO THIS BAIL OUT.

12:51:47.861 --> 12:51:50.197
IT STILL LEAVES UTILITY RATE

12:51:50.263 --> 12:51:51.264
PAYERS.

12:51:51.331 --> 12:51:53.700
ON THE HOOK.

12:51:53.767 --> 12:51:54.668
ON THE HOOK FOR HUGE COSTS DUE

12:51:54.735 --> 12:51:58.071
LARGELY. TO UTILITY NEGLIGENCE

12:51:58.138 --> 12:52:00.073
MEMBERS THE WORD NEGLIGENCE.

12:52:00.140 --> 12:52:02.542
DOESN'T EVEN APPEAR IN THE BILL

12:52:02.609 --> 12:52:03.477
WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF HOW

12:52:03.543 --> 12:52:04.645
LIMITED IS IT IS [inaudible]

12:52:04.711 --> 12:52:08.949
IN TERMS A RATE PAIR PROTECTIONS.

12:52:09.016 --> 12:52:10.050
IN THE MOST CRITICAL SECTION OF

12:52:10.117 --> 12:52:11.318
THE BILL ON COVERING THE COST OF

12:52:11.385 --> 12:52:13.920
WILD FIRE DAMAGES IN TWO

12:52:13.987 --> 12:52:14.788
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT STATES.

12:52:14.855 --> 12:52:15.756
THAT THE P. YOU SEE SHALL

12:52:15.822 --> 12:52:16.790
CONSIDER THE ELECTRICAL

12:52:16.857 --> 12:52:19.426
CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATUS.

12:52:19.493 --> 12:52:21.395
IN DETERMINE THE AMOUNT A

12:52:21.461 --> 12:52:25.332
CORPORATION CAN PAY.

12:52:25.399 --> 12:52:26.733
WITHOUT HARMING RATEPAYERS ARE

12:52:26.800 --> 12:52:28.669
MATERIALLY IMPACT IN ITS ABILITY

12:52:28.735 --> 12:52:29.536
TO PROVIDE.

12:52:29.603 --> 12:52:32.506
ADEQUATE AND SAFE SERVICE.

12:52:32.572 --> 12:52:34.107
THIS STRESS TEST [inaudible]

12:52:34.174 --> 12:52:37.077
PROCESS WILL ULTIMATELY

12:52:37.144 --> 12:52:38.812
DETERMINE HOW MUCH A UTILITY.

12:52:38.879 --> 12:52:40.313
AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS WILL PAY

12:52:40.380 --> 12:52:41.148
FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

12:52:41.214 --> 12:52:42.683
WILDFIRE DAMAGES [inaudible]

12:52:42.749 --> 12:52:44.518
SO.

12:52:44.584 --> 12:52:46.520
THIS PUTS A CAP THAT COULD WELL

12:52:46.586 --> 12:52:48.288
PROVE TO BE A DISPROPORTIONATELY

12:52:48.355 --> 12:52:49.523
LOW.

12:52:49.589 --> 12:52:50.357
ONE THAT ALLOWS IN THE POUND

12:52:50.424 --> 12:52:53.126
SIGN MAJOR COSTS TO RATEPAYERS

12:52:53.193 --> 12:52:57.264
TIED. TO UTILITY NEGLIGENCE SO

12:52:57.330 --> 12:52:59.032
AGAIN IT'S A CAP [inaudible] FOR

12:52:59.099 --> 12:53:00.567
SHAREHOLDERS.

12:53:00.634 --> 12:53:04.237
BUT NOT FOR RATEPAYERS.

12:53:04.304 --> 12:53:05.939
LET'S REMEMBER THAT CAO BUYER

12:53:06.006 --> 12:53:07.340
HAS FOUND THAT PJ ANY VIOLATED

12:53:07.407 --> 12:53:08.742
LAWS REQUIRING PROPER

12:53:08.809 --> 12:53:12.379
MAINTENANCE IN ELEVEN INSTANCES.

12:53:12.446 --> 12:53:13.680
AND THAT COULD ADD TO THE COST

12:53:13.747 --> 12:53:15.348
OF LAW LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS

12:53:15.415 --> 12:53:16.683
SUMMER THOSE.

12:53:16.750 --> 12:53:18.285
AFTER THE SAN BRUNO DISASTER

12:53:18.351 --> 12:53:20.387
THAT DISASTER.

12:53:20.454 --> 12:53:21.688
WHERE PIPELINE APPEAR GINNY

12:53:21.755 --> 12:53:23.990
PIPELINE BLEW UP A NEIGHBORHOOD

12:53:24.057 --> 12:53:25.992
WHERE PEOPLE IN THE SANCTITY OF

12:53:26.059 --> 12:53:26.893
THEIR OWN HOME [inaudible]

12:53:26.960 --> 12:53:29.196
WERE KILLED.

12:53:29.262 --> 12:53:29.763
THAT AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN A

12:53:29.830 --> 12:53:31.998
HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN LAWSUITS

12:53:32.065 --> 12:53:33.834
SETTLEMENTS.

12:53:33.900 --> 12:53:35.435
WHILE THOSE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS

12:53:35.502 --> 12:53:36.603
WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED PER P.

12:53:36.670 --> 12:53:37.738
GINNY COST RECOVERY FROM

12:53:37.804 --> 12:53:39.072
RATEPAYERS.

12:53:39.139 --> 12:53:40.140
NOTHING IN THIS BILL

12:53:40.207 --> 12:53:40.907
SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS THE STRESS

12:53:40.974 --> 12:53:43.076
TEST.

12:53:43.143 --> 12:53:44.311
FROM BEING APPLIED TO PGM EASE

12:53:44.377 --> 12:53:47.214
FINANCIAL STANDING AFTER.

12:53:47.280 --> 12:53:47.814
ASSESSMENT PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN

12:53:47.881 --> 12:53:49.249
APPLIED.

12:53:49.316 --> 12:53:51.351
AND HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ITS

12:53:51.418 --> 12:53:54.721
FINANCIAL STATUS.%

12:53:54.788 --> 12:53:56.423
I SUCH IN ADDITION TO PAINT

12:53:56.490 --> 12:53:57.958
REPEATING EASE NEGLIGENCE

12:53:58.024 --> 12:53:59.426
DIRECTLY.

12:53:59.493 --> 12:54:01.261
RATEPAYERS COULD BE ON THE HOOK.

12:54:01.328 --> 12:54:01.895
FOR ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO

12:54:01.962 --> 12:54:04.131
LAWSUITS.

12:54:04.197 --> 12:54:05.632
SO ONCE THE IMMEDIATE FINANCIAL

12:54:05.699 --> 12:54:08.135
THREAT HAS PASSED.

12:54:08.201 --> 12:54:09.336
SHAREHOLDERS AND WALL STREET

12:54:09.402 --> 12:54:11.404
UNDERWRITERS CAN RETURN TO THEIR

12:54:11.471 --> 12:54:13.940
SAFE DEPENDABLE PROFITS WHY RATE

12:54:14.007 --> 12:54:15.375
PIERCE WILL KEEP WRITING TRACKS.

12:54:15.442 --> 12:54:17.677
TO PAY FOR DAMAGE THEY DID NOT

12:54:17.744 --> 12:54:21.181
BECAUSE MEMBERS.

12:54:21.248 --> 12:54:23.283
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE COST OF OUR

12:54:23.350 --> 12:54:24.284
CHANGING CLIMATE WILL BE A

12:54:24.351 --> 12:54:25.952
SHARED.

12:54:26.019 --> 12:54:27.487
ONE WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

12:54:27.554 --> 12:54:28.588
TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN

12:54:28.655 --> 12:54:29.389
FIRE FIGHTING AND PREVENTION

12:54:29.456 --> 12:54:31.057
EFFORTS.

12:54:31.124 --> 12:54:32.893
IT WE WILL SURELY HAVE COSTS

12:54:32.959 --> 12:54:34.060
FROM FIRES.

12:54:34.127 --> 12:54:36.696
YET TO COME.

12:54:36.763 --> 12:54:37.764
COST WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

12:54:37.831 --> 12:54:38.064
[inaudible]

12:54:38.131 --> 12:54:41.334
THE COSTS OF NEGLIGENCE SHOULD

12:54:41.401 --> 12:54:44.638
NOT FALL PRIMARILY ON RATEPAYERS.

12:54:44.704 --> 12:54:46.807
THE UTILITY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS

12:54:46.873 --> 12:54:49.176
NEED TO SHARE RISK.

12:54:49.242 --> 12:54:49.876
NOT BE CAPPED BECAUSE OF A

12:54:49.943 --> 12:54:53.847
STRESS TEST THEY CAN'T SOCIALIZE.

12:54:53.914 --> 12:54:55.715
THE COST OF DISASTER.

12:54:55.782 --> 12:54:59.553
WHILE PRIVATIZING ALL PROFITS.

12:54:59.619 --> 12:55:03.123
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT

12:55:03.190 --> 12:55:06.860
RESOLVE THAT IMBALANCE.

12:55:06.927 --> 12:55:09.029
REMEMBER EVEN WHEN CONGRESS

12:55:09.095 --> 12:55:12.566
BAILED OUT THE AUTOMAKERS.

12:55:12.632 --> 12:55:16.136
THE AUTOMAKERS PAID THEM BACK.

12:55:16.203 --> 12:55:17.637
THEREFORE DESPITE.

12:55:17.704 --> 12:55:19.105
THE PROACTIVE FIRE SUPPRESSION

12:55:19.172 --> 12:55:21.241
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL.

12:55:21.308 --> 12:55:22.475
I ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

12:55:22.542 --> 12:55:26.379

TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AS YOU KNOW

12:55:47.734 --> 12:55:48.735
I'VE TALKED ABOUT VEGETATION

12:55:48.802 --> 12:55:50.637
MANAGEMENT.

12:55:50.704 --> 12:55:52.372

12:55:56.509 --> 12:55:58.511
THAT WE WERE USING [inaudible]

12:55:58.578 --> 12:56:00.180
AND CARBON.

12:56:00.247 --> 12:56:02.382
AS FOR TRANSPORTATION AS WHERE

12:56:02.449 --> 12:56:03.516
WE SPEND MOST OF OUR RESOURCES

12:56:03.583 --> 12:56:04.951
BECAUSE I THOUGHT.

12:56:05.018 --> 12:56:05.752
WE SHOULD PUT MORE THOSE

12:56:05.819 --> 12:56:08.722
RESOURCES TOWARDS.

12:56:08.788 --> 12:56:10.190
EWING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN

12:56:10.257 --> 12:56:14.828

12:56:14.895 --> 12:56:16.329
WE CAME TO THE POINT LAST YEAR

12:56:16.396 --> 12:56:18.765
WHERE WE SAW CATASTROPHIC

12:56:18.832 --> 12:56:19.065
[inaudible]

12:56:19.132 --> 12:56:21.268
WILD BUYER.

12:56:21.334 --> 12:56:23.069
OVER FIVE THOUSAND HOMES BURNED

12:56:23.136 --> 12:56:25.071
DOWN THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING

12:56:25.138 --> 12:56:27.274
THIS CONVERSATION TONIGHT.

12:56:27.340 --> 12:56:28.942
BECAUSE THOSE FIRES AND NOT A

12:56:29.009 --> 12:56:31.845
CASES WORK BECAUSE BY UTILITIES.

12:56:31.912 --> 12:56:33.546
BUT I WILL SHARE THIS WITH YOU.

12:56:33.613 --> 12:56:35.415
THAT WHAT ONE OUT A TEN FIRES IS

12:56:35.482 --> 12:56:37.484
STARTED BY UTILITIES.

12:56:37.550 --> 12:56:40.020
THE OTHER NINE ARE STARTED BY.

12:56:40.086 --> 12:56:41.388
AUTOMOBILES LIGHTNING MANY OTHER

12:56:41.454 --> 12:56:43.690
THINGS.

12:56:43.757 --> 12:56:45.358
I HAVEN'T CHRISTIAN USE A PROP

12:56:45.425 --> 12:56:45.659

12:56:45.725 --> 12:56:49.596

12:56:49.663 --> 12:56:51.598
THIS IS CAL FIRES.

12:56:51.665 --> 12:56:54.434
FIRE THREAT MAP.

12:56:54.501 --> 12:56:56.202
IF YOU'RE IN RED.

12:56:56.269 --> 12:56:59.506
YOU'RE GONNA BURN.

12:56:59.572 --> 12:57:00.106
I DON'T KNOW NGUYEN BUT YOU'RE

12:57:00.173 --> 12:57:04.778

12:57:04.844 --> 12:57:07.147
I SEE A LOT OF MILLIONS OF

12:57:07.213 --> 12:57:08.982
PEOPLE LIVING DOWN HERE.

12:57:09.049 --> 12:57:11.618
MAYBE A MILLION FROM HERE UP.

12:57:11.685 --> 12:57:14.254
BUT THAT YOU'RE WATERSHED.

12:57:14.321 --> 12:57:17.824

ACRES JUST THIS YEAR. SEVEN

12:57:25.832 --> 12:57:27.634
PEOPLE DIED.

12:57:27.701 --> 12:57:29.936
IN REDDING CALIFORNIA.

12:57:30.003 --> 12:57:33.139
WHEN A FIRE TORNADO?

12:57:33.206 --> 12:57:34.941

BITING THE SPIRES.

12:57:40.914 --> 12:57:43.116
NOW WE KNOW ONE THING.

12:57:43.183 --> 12:57:47.554
FIRE CANNOT BURN WITHOUT FUEL.

12:57:47.620 --> 12:57:48.755
YOU TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THE FIRE.

12:57:48.822 --> 12:57:50.357

12:57:57.397 --> 12:57:59.733
I'VE BEEN ASKING SIX YEARS TO

12:57:59.799 --> 12:58:01.067
REDUCE.

12:58:01.134 --> 12:58:06.206
VEGETATION AND FUEL.

12:58:06.272 --> 12:58:07.240
YOU'RE GONNA BURN IF WE DON'T DO

12:58:07.307 --> 12:58:08.775

12:58:15.682 --> 12:58:17.784
CAME TO A POINT.

12:58:17.851 --> 12:58:19.352
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY DO

12:58:19.419 --> 12:58:21.054
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

12:58:21.121 --> 12:58:21.354
[inaudible]

12:58:21.421 --> 12:58:23.423
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL

12:58:23.490 --> 12:58:25.492
REDUCE THE RISK.

12:58:25.558 --> 12:58:28.128
EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA.

12:58:28.194 --> 12:58:29.929
IF YOU'RE A HOMEOWNER.

12:58:29.996 --> 12:58:31.564
IT'S GONNA DRIVE YOUR CHURCH

12:58:31.631 --> 12:58:33.433
RATES DOWN.

12:58:33.500 --> 12:58:35.335
IF YOU DRINK WATER.

12:58:35.402 --> 12:58:36.269
IT'S CAN PROVIDE MORE WATER WE

12:58:36.336 --> 12:58:38.938
DO VEGETATION NAMES IN THE FORCE.

12:58:39.005 --> 12:58:40.840
WE'D TO EXPAND ON TOOLS LIKE

12:58:40.907 --> 12:58:43.576
GRAZING IN THE 300-010-0023

12:58:43.643 --> 12:58:45.278
THOUSAND FOOT AREA.

12:58:45.345 --> 12:58:46.046
ON THE COAST YOU WHO LIVE ON THE

12:58:46.112 --> 12:58:47.781
COAST.

12:58:47.847 --> 12:58:50.116
WHERE THERE'S BRUSH?

12:58:50.183 --> 12:58:52.852
YOU NEED RESOURCES TO DO.

12:58:52.919 --> 12:58:54.554
MASTICATION IT'S A MACHINE THAT

12:58:54.621 --> 12:58:55.855
BRUSHES IT DOWN BECAUSE YOU

12:58:55.922 --> 12:58:57.290
NEEDED TO STAY ALIVE.

12:58:57.357 --> 12:58:58.458
SO THAT WHEN IT RAINS IT DOESN'T

12:58:58.525 --> 12:59:00.193
WASH IN THE OCEAN THAT'S WHERE

12:59:00.260 --> 12:59:04.030
THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT.

12:59:04.097 --> 12:59:05.231
I WON A CIRCLE BACK TO THE

12:59:05.298 --> 12:59:07.667
UTILITIES AND BUT MY PREVIOUS

12:59:07.734 --> 12:59:11.471
COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT.

12:59:11.538 --> 12:59:13.506
IT'S NOT PERFECT BILL.

12:59:13.573 --> 12:59:14.040
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A

12:59:14.107 --> 12:59:15.442
PERFECT BILL.

12:59:15.508 --> 12:59:16.543
THE WRANGLINGS THAT WENT BACK

12:59:16.609 --> 12:59:17.577
AND FORTH BETWEEN THE HOUSES WAS

12:59:17.644 --> 12:59:19.846
DIFFICULT.

12:59:19.913 --> 12:59:20.480
BUT I WILL SHARE WITH THIS WITH

12:59:20.547 --> 12:59:24.350
YOU. TO DO NOTHING. TO DO

12:59:24.417 --> 12:59:26.219
NOTHING.

12:59:26.286 --> 12:59:28.421
WOULD BE ON US.

12:59:28.488 --> 12:59:29.722
WE'VE DONE SOMETHING.

12:59:29.789 --> 12:59:31.524
IT'S NOT PERFECT.

12:59:31.591 --> 12:59:32.725
BUT I THINK IS A STEP IN THE

12:59:32.792 --> 12:59:34.561
RIGHT DIRECTION I AM PROUD TO BE

12:59:34.627 --> 12:59:35.929
ABLE TO SAY THAT I CAN VOTE.

12:59:35.995 --> 12:59:37.464
FOR S. B. NINE A ONE BECAUSE I

12:59:37.530 --> 12:59:38.832
CAN GO BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS

12:59:38.898 --> 12:59:39.866
AND ALL OF YOU CAN DO THE SAME

12:59:39.933 --> 12:59:40.600
THING.

12:59:40.667 --> 12:59:41.835
WE NEED TO TURN CALIFORNIA FROM

12:59:41.901 --> 12:59:42.969
RED.

12:59:43.036 --> 12:59:45.105
BACK TO GOLD GOLDEN STATE LIKE

12:59:45.171 --> 12:59:46.539

THIS SOON.

12:59:53.413 --> 12:59:55.148
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME BUT

12:59:55.215 --> 12:59:56.249
THIS IS A STEP AND I JUDGE WE

12:59:56.316 --> 12:59:57.917
ACTUALLY HAVE PUT RESOURCES. TO

12:59:57.984 --> 12:59:59.886

THEIR GENERAL.

13:00:22.008 --> 13:00:23.076

WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THE

13:02:46.486 --> 13:02:48.588
SESSION GO AND NOT START TO TAKE

13:02:48.655 --> 13:02:50.490
THIS.

13:02:50.556 --> 13:02:51.924
AND AND MOVE HEAD WITH THAT WE

13:02:51.991 --> 13:02:54.961
NEED TO START IT'S A GOOD START --

13:02:55.028 --> 13:02:56.262
WE CAN AFFORD TO GO THROUGH

13:02:56.329 --> 13:02:58.231
OTHER FIRE SEASONS IN YEARS OF

13:02:58.298 --> 13:03:00.266
NOT TAKING CARE THIS VEGETATION

13:03:00.333 --> 13:03:01.367
MANAGEMENT.

AND SOME OF THE OTHER DEALS WITH

13:03:03.636 --> 13:03:05.738
THE UTILITIES ORIGIN I'VE.

13:03:05.805 --> 13:03:07.040
THANK YOU MISS WALDRON

13:03:07.106 --> 13:03:07.340

13:03:07.407 --> 13:03:09.909
DOCTOR EGGMAN.

13:03:09.976 --> 13:03:11.144
I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER

13:03:11.210 --> 13:03:14.414
MEMBERS I I'M I WAS NOT A AND

13:03:14.480 --> 13:03:17.016
ONE OF WAS A PRIVILEGE ERA THAT.

13:03:17.083 --> 13:03:18.351
AND THE PUNISHMENT TO BE ON THE

13:03:18.418 --> 13:03:20.720
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE --

13:03:20.787 --> 13:03:22.488
BUT I WATCHED MOST OF THEM AND I

13:03:22.555 --> 13:03:23.990
AND I SERVE ON NATURAL RESOURCES

13:03:24.057 --> 13:03:25.024
AND I AM.

13:03:25.091 --> 13:03:25.958
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN VERY

13:03:26.025 --> 13:03:27.427
INTERESTED AND INVOLVED IN THIS

13:03:27.493 --> 13:03:29.429
TOPIC AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

13:03:29.495 --> 13:03:30.396
THIS BILL.

13:03:30.463 --> 13:03:31.764
AND AS PEOPLE SAID IT IS NOT A

13:03:31.831 --> 13:03:33.266
PERFECT BILL AND I DON'T THINK

13:03:33.333 --> 13:03:34.934
ANYTHING THAT WE EVER DO IN THIS

13:03:35.001 --> 13:03:36.869
BUILDING IS PERFECT NOR CAN

13:03:36.936 --> 13:03:38.938
ANYONE ASK US. TO WORK TOWARDS

13:03:39.005 --> 13:03:40.239
PERFECTION BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN

13:03:40.306 --> 13:03:42.508
BEINGS DOING THE BEST WE CAN IN

13:03:42.575 --> 13:03:43.810
AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED

13:03:43.876 --> 13:03:46.012
ENVIRONMENT.

13:03:46.079 --> 13:03:47.180
BUT I TELL YOU SOMEBODY WHO

13:03:47.246 --> 13:03:48.681
LIVES IN THE VALLEY.

13:03:48.748 --> 13:03:49.849
AND WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED

13:03:49.916 --> 13:03:51.284
ABOUT OUR AIR.

13:03:51.351 --> 13:03:53.453
AND THE PRICES BAR OF OUR ENERGY

13:03:53.519 --> 13:03:55.021
THAT WE HAVE HAD TO HAVE OUR AIR

13:03:55.088 --> 13:03:56.789
CONDITIONING IS RUNNING MORE

13:03:56.856 --> 13:03:58.691
THAN I HAVE EVER HAD MY PUP MY

13:03:58.758 --> 13:03:59.992
POWER BILLS HIGHER THAN IT'S

13:04:00.059 --> 13:04:01.194
EVER BEEN BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN

13:04:01.260 --> 13:04:02.562
ABLE TO HAVE OUR WINDOWS OPEN.

13:04:02.628 --> 13:04:04.764
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO SMOKEY AND

13:04:04.831 --> 13:04:05.331
PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

13:04:05.398 --> 13:04:06.532
BREEZE.

13:04:06.599 --> 13:04:08.201
BECAUSE OF THE FIRES THAT ARE

13:04:08.267 --> 13:04:09.769
HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM US

13:04:09.836 --> 13:04:12.472
BUT THE BUT THE SMOKE COMES DOWN.

13:04:12.538 --> 13:04:15.308
AND EVERYBODY SUFFERS FROM IT --

13:04:15.375 --> 13:04:16.976
AND THERE WAS UP A FEW MEMBERS

13:04:17.043 --> 13:04:18.411
OF THE OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WHO

13:04:18.478 --> 13:04:20.113
HAPPEN TO BE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS

13:04:20.179 --> 13:04:22.281
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO --

13:04:22.348 --> 13:04:23.916
WHEN ANOTHER FIRE BROKE OUT?

13:04:23.983 --> 13:04:25.051
A AND WE HAD TO BE EVACUATED OUT

13:04:25.118 --> 13:04:27.453
OF A PLACE --

13:04:27.520 --> 13:04:28.988
AND I TALK WITH SOME OF THE

13:04:29.055 --> 13:04:30.356
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER THAT TIME

13:04:30.423 --> 13:04:30.990
AND SAID WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED

13:04:31.057 --> 13:04:32.191
ABOUT.

13:04:32.258 --> 13:04:33.059
YOU KNOW LETTING PEOPLE KNOW

13:04:33.126 --> 13:04:35.294
WHEN THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

13:04:35.361 --> 13:04:36.696
AN OF CHP OFFICER SAID WE'VE

13:04:36.763 --> 13:04:38.464
LEARNED THAT SOMETIMES THEY MOVE

13:04:38.531 --> 13:04:40.333
SO FAST THERE'S NO TIME.

13:04:40.400 --> 13:04:42.402
THERE'S JUST NO TIME.

13:04:42.468 --> 13:04:44.537
AND AND JUST ONE OTHER ISSUE WE

13:04:44.604 --> 13:04:45.104
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH IS

13:04:45.171 --> 13:04:46.572
WILDLIFE.

13:04:46.639 --> 13:04:48.875
AS WE WERE BEING EVACUATED OUT

13:04:48.941 --> 13:04:50.109
AND AS WE WERE GOING DOWN DARK

13:04:50.176 --> 13:04:51.811
ROADS.

13:04:51.878 --> 13:04:53.112
ALL YOU COULD SEE ON THE SIDES

13:04:53.179 --> 13:04:57.049
OF THE ROAD WERE EYES OF ANIMALS.

13:04:57.116 --> 13:04:58.050
HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS WHO ARE

13:04:58.117 --> 13:05:00.420
RUNNING FROM THE FIRES.

13:05:00.486 --> 13:05:02.321
TRYING TO FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE

13:05:02.388 --> 13:05:02.922
AND AND THERE ISN'T ANY PLACE

13:05:02.989 --> 13:05:04.991
SAFE.

13:05:05.057 --> 13:05:06.159
SO FOR THOSE ANIMAL LOVERS THINK

13:05:06.225 --> 13:05:09.195
ABOUT THAT.

13:05:09.262 --> 13:05:10.596
AND THEN ALSO SAY IF YOU'RE

13:05:10.663 --> 13:05:13.332
WORRIED ABOUT RATES GOING UP.

13:05:13.399 --> 13:05:15.568
IF WE DO NOTHING.

13:05:15.635 --> 13:05:18.404
RATES ARE ARE ARE GONNA GO UP.

13:05:18.471 --> 13:05:19.539
AND THEN I'LL TALK BRIEFLY JUST

13:05:19.605 --> 13:05:21.240
AS A SOCIAL WORKER.

13:05:21.307 --> 13:05:23.543
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN

13:05:23.609 --> 13:05:25.578
DO AS A GOVERNMENT WHAT OUR

13:05:25.645 --> 13:05:27.413
CHARGE IS?

13:05:27.480 --> 13:05:29.215
IT'S I HOPE WE HAVE PEOPLE TRUST

13:05:29.282 --> 13:05:30.716
IN THEIR GOVERNMENT.

13:05:30.783 --> 13:05:31.584
AND TRUST THAT WITH THE

13:05:31.651 --> 13:05:32.885
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE THAT

13:05:32.952 --> 13:05:35.555
WE'RE DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN.

13:05:35.621 --> 13:05:36.422
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE

13:05:36.489 --> 13:05:38.124
LEVEL OF ANXIETY THAT PEOPLE

13:05:38.191 --> 13:05:39.926
HAVE WHO LIVE IN FIRE DISTRICTS

13:05:39.992 --> 13:05:41.194
WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE

13:05:41.260 --> 13:05:42.829
GOING TO GO TO BE SAFE.

13:05:42.895 --> 13:05:43.796
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING

13:05:43.863 --> 13:05:45.164
TO HAVE A HOME TO GO TO WHO

13:05:45.231 --> 13:05:46.599
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCHOOLS

13:05:46.666 --> 13:05:48.201
GOING TO GO ON IN THE MORNING.

13:05:48.267 --> 13:05:50.036
WHO WHERE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS OF

13:05:50.102 --> 13:05:51.270
LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE BEEN

13:05:51.337 --> 13:05:52.472
WIPED OUT AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE

13:05:52.538 --> 13:05:54.907
INSURANCE?

13:05:54.974 --> 13:05:57.109
THAT LEVEL OF ANXIETY.

13:05:57.176 --> 13:06:00.046
IT WE CAN'T JUST WISH IT AWAY.

13:06:00.112 --> 13:06:02.715
IT TAKES ACTION IT TAKES PEOPLE

13:06:02.782 --> 13:06:04.784
SAYING WE'RE PUTTING PLANS IN

13:06:04.851 --> 13:06:06.085
PLACE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE

13:06:06.152 --> 13:06:07.386
DATA WE CAN IN THIS IS THE BEST

13:06:07.453 --> 13:06:08.821
THAT WE CAME UP WITH IN THIS

13:06:08.888 --> 13:06:09.856
AMOUNT OF TIME.

13:06:09.922 --> 13:06:11.057
AND WE'RE GOING TO THIS IS WHAT

13:06:11.123 --> 13:06:12.725
WE'RE GOING ON AND THAT WE'RE

13:06:12.792 --> 13:06:13.826
NOT WALKING AWAY FROM IT THEY

13:06:13.893 --> 13:06:14.927
WERE TO CONTINUE COME BACK IN

13:06:14.994 --> 13:06:15.795
THE FALL WE'RE GONNA WORK ON

13:06:15.862 --> 13:06:17.263
THIS WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT EVEN

13:06:17.330 --> 13:06:18.798
BETTER WHERE TO CONTINUE TO

13:06:18.865 --> 13:06:20.066
ADDRESS THIS.

13:06:20.132 --> 13:06:21.467
BUT HERE ON THIS LAST DAY OF

13:06:21.534 --> 13:06:22.969
SESSION THIS IS THE BEST WORK

13:06:23.035 --> 13:06:24.904
THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH.

13:06:24.971 --> 13:06:25.738
THAT IS GOING TO BE A HOPE WOULD

13:06:25.805 --> 13:06:27.840
BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN RATES.

13:06:27.907 --> 13:06:29.609
DEEPER UTILITIES IN BUSINESS TO

13:06:29.675 --> 13:06:30.776
TAKE CARE OF OUR FOREST.

13:06:30.843 --> 13:06:32.478
AND TO GIVE [inaudible]

13:06:32.545 --> 13:06:35.214
CALIFORNIANS SOME PEACE OF MIND

13:06:35.281 --> 13:06:36.682
THAT THERE LEGISLATORS ARE DOING

13:06:36.749 --> 13:06:38.451
THE BEST THAT THEY CAN. TO PASS

13:06:38.518 --> 13:06:39.752
LAWS [inaudible]

13:06:39.819 --> 13:06:41.354
PROTECT THEM.

13:06:41.420 --> 13:06:43.322
I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE

13:06:43.389 --> 13:06:43.623
[inaudible]

13:06:43.689 --> 13:06:46.626
MISTER STONE.

13:06:46.692 --> 13:06:48.794
YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS

13:06:48.861 --> 13:06:49.996
AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE

13:06:50.062 --> 13:06:51.697
CHAIRMAN.

13:06:51.764 --> 13:06:53.399
FROM PASADENA BUT THIS TOGETHER

13:06:53.466 --> 13:06:56.536
AND MINORITY LEADER WHO REALLY

13:06:56.602 --> 13:06:58.337
WORKED HARD ON THIS DEAL IN THE

13:06:58.404 --> 13:06:59.939
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO

13:07:00.006 --> 13:07:02.275
SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THIS.

13:07:02.341 --> 13:07:03.876
THE DILEMMA THAT I FIND IS THAT

13:07:03.943 --> 13:07:05.978
WE'VE CONFLATED TWO VERY

13:07:06.045 --> 13:07:08.447
DIFFERENT THINGS AND ONE IS.

13:07:08.514 --> 13:07:10.383
PROTECTING P. GENIES LIABILITY

13:07:10.449 --> 13:07:12.084
WHICH IS REALLY BACK AND THEN

13:07:12.151 --> 13:07:14.186
THIS STARTED OUT OF A PANIC.

13:07:14.253 --> 13:07:16.122
ABOUT PROTECTING P. JEANNIE.

13:07:16.188 --> 13:07:17.890
ALL ON THE BACK AND WITH REALLY

13:07:17.957 --> 13:07:19.458
NO TALK ABOUT THE FRONT END

13:07:19.525 --> 13:07:22.228
WHICH IS EXACTLY THE VEGETATION

13:07:22.295 --> 13:07:24.230
MANAGEMENT THE WORK THAT NEEDS

13:07:24.297 --> 13:07:25.164
TO BE DONE.

13:07:25.231 --> 13:07:26.699
THE HARDENING OF THE SYSTEMS ALL

13:07:26.766 --> 13:07:27.433
THOSE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

13:07:27.500 --> 13:07:29.068
DONE TO PREVENT FIRES FROM

13:07:29.135 --> 13:07:31.170
GETTING WORSE ONCE THEY START

13:07:31.237 --> 13:07:33.272
BECAUSE FIRES WILL START.

13:07:33.339 --> 13:07:34.907
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE AMOUNT

13:07:34.974 --> 13:07:35.474
OF MONEY THAT'S BEING PUT IN

13:07:35.541 --> 13:07:37.677
HERE. TO GO CLEAN UP SOME OF

13:07:37.743 --> 13:07:39.278
THESE PROPERTIES BECAUSE THERE

13:07:39.345 --> 13:07:40.379
HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF MONEY

13:07:40.446 --> 13:07:42.281
THAT'S DONE THAT.

13:07:42.348 --> 13:07:44.016
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT SOME

13:07:44.083 --> 13:07:46.485
OF THE RELAXATION OF THE RULES.

13:07:46.552 --> 13:07:49.088
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE THE PEOPLE

13:07:49.155 --> 13:07:51.157
WHO HAVE MARKETABLE TREES ON

13:07:51.223 --> 13:07:52.525
THEIR PROPERTY ARE GOING TO BE

13:07:52.592 --> 13:07:54.160
HAPPY WITH THAT RELAXATION.

13:07:54.226 --> 13:07:55.928
AND THEY'RE GONNA CUT.

13:07:55.995 --> 13:07:57.229
BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY

13:07:57.296 --> 13:07:59.231
GOING TO DUE THE FIRE MANAGEMENT

13:07:59.298 --> 13:08:00.333
THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT

13:08:00.399 --> 13:08:01.968
THAT WE'RE EXPECTING HERE.

13:08:02.034 --> 13:08:03.135
IF WE PUT USE YOUR OF MONEY UP

13:08:03.202 --> 13:08:04.503
FRONT.

13:08:04.570 --> 13:08:06.238
THEN WE CAN SAY THIS IS WHAT WE

13:08:06.305 --> 13:08:07.540
EXPECT YOU TO DO WITH THAT MONEY

13:08:07.607 --> 13:08:08.641
SO I THINK THAT'S MONEY GOING TO

13:08:08.708 --> 13:08:10.643
BE VERY WELL SPENT.

13:08:10.710 --> 13:08:11.877
THERE'S ALSO SOME MONEY FOR THE

13:08:11.944 --> 13:08:13.412
FIREFIGHTERS WE ASK THE FIRE

13:08:13.479 --> 13:08:14.847
CHIEF WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING

13:08:14.914 --> 13:08:17.116
FOR THE EXPIRED SEASON THEY SAID.

13:08:17.183 --> 13:08:18.851
MONEY FOR EQUIPMENT FOR PRE

13:08:18.918 --> 13:08:20.152
POSITIONING FOR USING THE

13:08:20.219 --> 13:08:21.420
PREDICTIVE TOOL SO THAT WE KNOW

13:08:21.487 --> 13:08:22.688
WHERE THE FIRES ARE GOING TO BE

13:08:22.755 --> 13:08:23.889
STARTING TO HAPPEN.

13:08:23.956 --> 13:08:25.491
HOW WE CAN KNOCK THEM DOWN

13:08:25.558 --> 13:08:27.326
BEFORE IT HAPPENS [inaudible]

13:08:27.393 --> 13:08:29.428
SO.

13:08:29.495 --> 13:08:30.896
THAT PIECE OF IT.

13:08:30.963 --> 13:08:32.298
IS ACTUALLY A LOT BETTER THAN I

13:08:32.365 --> 13:08:33.566
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND I HAVE

13:08:33.633 --> 13:08:34.500
TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM

13:08:34.567 --> 13:08:36.302
BIEBER WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS

13:08:36.369 --> 13:08:37.503
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW FOLKS HERE

13:08:37.570 --> 13:08:39.071
WHO'S DONE LAND USE.

13:08:39.138 --> 13:08:40.172
AND DONE FORESTRY AND

13:08:40.239 --> 13:08:41.440
UNDERSTANDS THE PATTERNS IN THE

13:08:41.507 --> 13:08:43.442
PRACTICES IN THOSE INDUSTRIES

13:08:43.509 --> 13:08:45.911
AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE

13:08:45.978 --> 13:08:48.781
JUST LOOSEN UP REGULATIONS OR IF

WAY WE EXPECT THEM TO DO.

13:08:55.054 --> 13:08:55.921
BUT WE'VE ALSO CONFLATED THIS

13:08:55.988 --> 13:08:57.990
WITH THE LIABILITY FEES AND AND

13:08:58.057 --> 13:08:59.759
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN VERSE

13:08:59.825 --> 13:09:01.160
AND LIABILITY IN ALL THAT THAT

13:09:01.227 --> 13:09:02.061
HAS BEEN.

13:09:02.128 --> 13:09:04.997
A MECHANISM. TO GET MONEY INTO

13:09:05.064 --> 13:09:06.298
THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE

13:09:06.365 --> 13:09:07.967
REBUILT AFTER THE FIRE THAT'S

13:09:08.034 --> 13:09:09.835
REALLY WHAT THAT IS.

13:09:09.902 --> 13:09:11.771

THE THE THESE RULES A KATYUSHA

13:09:13.272 --> 13:09:14.774
RULES THAT APPLY TO PGD BECAUSE

13:09:14.840 --> 13:09:16.509

13:09:19.545 --> 13:09:21.514
IT MONEY.

13:09:21.580 --> 13:09:22.415
GUARANTEED RAIDER TURNED BUT THE

13:09:22.481 --> 13:09:26.519
THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT. TO THEM IS

13:09:26.585 --> 13:09:27.687
HAVING TO TAKE ON ALL THIS

13:09:27.753 --> 13:09:29.088
RESPONSIBILITY AND STUPIDLY FUN

13:09:29.155 --> 13:09:30.589

13:09:30.656 --> 13:09:31.824
THEY'RE NOW THEY'VE MADE

13:09:31.891 --> 13:09:34.093
DECISIONS.

13:09:34.160 --> 13:09:36.462

13:09:37.129 --> 13:09:38.698
AT RISK.

13:09:38.764 --> 13:09:40.399
AND THOUGH NOW THE

13:09:40.466 --> 13:09:41.967
CONFLAGRATIONS OF COST SO MUCH

13:09:42.034 --> 13:09:43.836
THAT THEY'RE VERY VERY WORRIED

13:09:43.903 --> 13:09:45.271
ABOUT WHAT THAT REPRESENTS I

13:09:45.337 --> 13:09:46.872
GUESS WALL STREET IS.

13:09:46.939 --> 13:09:48.441
AND BONDING AGENCIES AND ALL

13:09:48.507 --> 13:09:49.875
THAT ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT

13:09:49.942 --> 13:09:51.844
THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE THROUGH

13:09:51.911 --> 13:09:53.345
THIS WE HAVEN'T REALLY TESTED

13:09:53.412 --> 13:09:53.646
[inaudible]

13:09:53.713 --> 13:09:56.682
AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

13:09:56.749 --> 13:09:58.084
BEING PROPOSED AND I DO

13:09:58.150 --> 13:10:00.319
UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO

13:10:00.386 --> 13:10:01.821
HELP OUT ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A

13:10:01.887 --> 13:10:04.623
VIABLE UTILITY AFTER ALL OF THIS.

13:10:04.690 --> 13:10:05.825
BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT

13:10:05.891 --> 13:10:07.727
IF WE DON'T DO THIS RIGHT.

13:10:07.793 --> 13:10:08.627
THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

13:10:08.694 --> 13:10:09.795
TELLING OUR CONSTITUENTS OF THE

13:10:09.862 --> 13:10:10.896
END OF THE DAY SORRY YOU GOT

13:10:10.963 --> 13:10:12.732
BURNED OUT BUT THERE'S NOT

13:10:12.798 --> 13:10:14.233
ENOUGH MONEY FOR YOU TO REBUILD.

13:10:14.300 --> 13:10:16.068
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DEAD.

13:10:16.135 --> 13:10:19.004

13:10:19.071 --> 13:10:20.072
FIVE SIX YEARS SEVEN YEARS FOR

13:10:20.139 --> 13:10:22.074
FOR OTHERS.

13:10:22.141 --> 13:10:23.275
AND UTILITIES ARE STILL FLASH

13:10:23.342 --> 13:10:25.845
AND HAPPY.

13:10:25.911 --> 13:10:26.779
AND THE RATEPAYERS ARE STILL

13:10:26.846 --> 13:10:28.781
CONTINUING TO PAY THAT MONEY.

13:10:28.848 --> 13:10:29.448
THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT US

13:10:29.515 --> 13:10:32.985
AND SAYING WHAT DID YOU DO.

13:10:33.052 --> 13:10:35.454
SO I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

13:10:35.521 --> 13:10:36.455
THE BACK END AND THE FOCUS OF

13:10:36.522 --> 13:10:37.857
THE BACKEND.

13:10:37.923 --> 13:10:39.158
AND EVEN THOUGH THEIR PROVISIONS

13:10:39.225 --> 13:10:40.593
IN HERE TO GET PGP HARD TO DO

13:10:40.659 --> 13:10:42.328
THE WORK UP FRONT.

13:10:42.394 --> 13:10:43.729

13:10:43.796 --> 13:10:44.363
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS WE'RE GONNA

13:10:44.430 --> 13:10:45.798
DO THAT.

13:10:45.865 --> 13:10:46.866
AND I KEEP ASKING MYSELF WHERE

13:10:46.932 --> 13:10:48.901
WERE YOU TEN YEARS AGO.

13:10:48.968 --> 13:10:50.569
AT DOING THE HARDENING IT DOING

13:10:50.636 --> 13:10:51.604
THE PREDICTIVE TOOLS THAT

13:10:51.670 --> 13:10:53.205
HELPING US MAKE SURE THAT THESE

13:10:53.272 --> 13:10:55.307
FIRES DIDN'T GET OUT OF HAND TO

13:10:55.374 --> 13:10:57.143
BEGIN WITH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S

13:10:57.209 --> 13:10:58.844
BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE ES DE JEANNIE

13:10:58.911 --> 13:11:00.079
BECAUSE THEY'RE FIRED AND SAN

13:11:00.146 --> 13:11:00.312
DIEGO.

13:11:00.379 --> 13:11:01.981
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT

13:11:02.047 --> 13:11:02.615
THEY'VE ACCIDENT PRETTY GOOD JOB

13:11:02.681 --> 13:11:02.915
[inaudible]

13:11:02.982 --> 13:11:06.385
OF SENDING UP SO WE HAD THOSE

13:11:06.452 --> 13:11:08.621
EXAMPLES IN CALIFORNIA OF STUDY

13:11:08.687 --> 13:11:11.056
OF WHAT TO DO FOR A UTILITY.

13:11:11.123 --> 13:11:12.658
SO YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE ON THIS ON

13:11:12.725 --> 13:11:13.292
YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE WHAT YOU'RE

13:11:13.359 --> 13:11:14.827
GONNA DO.

13:11:14.894 --> 13:11:15.961
IT'S SO COMPLICATED WITH

13:11:16.028 --> 13:11:18.531
CONFLATED SO MANY THINGS IN HERE

13:11:18.597 --> 13:11:19.431
THIRTY SECONDS REYES DOWN

13:11:19.498 --> 13:11:21.500
DIFFICULT TO TO KNOW WHAT THE

13:11:21.567 --> 13:11:23.402
RIGHT ANSWER IS BUT FOR THOSE OF

13:11:23.469 --> 13:11:24.470
US WHO ARE GOING TO BE AROUND

13:11:24.537 --> 13:11:25.604
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF WE DO

13:11:25.671 --> 13:11:27.039
PASS THIS.

13:11:27.106 --> 13:11:28.274
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

13:11:28.340 --> 13:11:30.009
HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO NGUYEN

13:11:30.075 --> 13:11:33.546
AND AND COOP ACT IF NECESSARY

13:11:33.612 --> 13:11:34.380
MONEY TO GET BACK TO OUR

13:11:34.446 --> 13:11:37.116
RATEPAYERS. TO HOLD PGD ANY

13:11:37.183 --> 13:11:38.851
OTHER UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR

13:11:38.918 --> 13:11:39.919
MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR

13:11:39.985 --> 13:11:42.054
PART IF WE'RE GONNA DO OUR PART

13:11:42.121 --> 13:11:42.822
BY PUTTING THE MONEY ON THE

13:11:42.888 --> 13:11:44.056
TABLE AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE

13:11:44.123 --> 13:11:45.591
DOING VEGETATION AND FORESTRY

13:11:45.658 --> 13:11:46.692
MANAGEMENT.

13:11:46.759 --> 13:11:47.793
THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT'S

13:11:47.860 --> 13:11:49.628
BEEN DONE THIS IS A VERY

13:11:49.695 --> 13:11:51.330
DIFFICULT DECISION WERE WORKING

13:11:51.397 --> 13:11:52.364
WITH A LOT OF UNKNOWNS INCLUDING

13:11:52.431 --> 13:11:53.866
NOT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THE RATE

13:11:53.933 --> 13:11:55.501
ISSUE IS WITH PGD BECAUSE WE

13:11:55.568 --> 13:11:56.535
DON'T SEE THEM OR SHARE WITH US

13:11:56.602 --> 13:11:58.170
THEIR FINANCIALS.

13:11:58.237 --> 13:12:00.105
SO IT'S VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT.

13:12:00.172 --> 13:12:00.673
WHAT THE UPSIDE IS WHAT THE

13:12:00.739 --> 13:12:02.041
DOWNSIDE IS [inaudible]

13:12:02.107 --> 13:12:03.742
SO.

13:12:03.809 --> 13:12:05.578
GOOD LUCK IT'S AFTER TEN THIRTY

13:12:05.644 --> 13:12:07.046
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME AND WE

13:12:07.112 --> 13:12:08.380
HAVE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

13:12:08.447 --> 13:12:09.415
DECISIONS I THINK THAT WE HAVE

13:12:09.481 --> 13:12:13.319
FACED IN A LONG TIME.

13:12:13.385 --> 13:12:14.887
AS MR STONE SAID WE'RE RUNNING

13:12:14.954 --> 13:12:16.589
OUT OF TIME [inaudible]

13:12:16.655 --> 13:12:19.592
SO WE'RE WE HAVE THREE MORE

13:12:19.658 --> 13:12:21.160
MICROPHONES TO MORE MICROPHONES

13:12:21.227 --> 13:12:22.361
UP AND THEN A CLOSE MISTER

13:12:22.428 --> 13:12:24.330
VOEPEL.

13:12:24.396 --> 13:12:26.765
HOW GOOD VAST MISTER SPEAKER?

THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S THE BACK

13:12:29.068 --> 13:12:31.270
AT WE HAVE TO DO IT TO SOME

13:12:31.337 --> 13:12:34.673
GREAT EXTENT.

13:12:34.740 --> 13:12:35.274
BUT THE REASON I'M GOING TO

13:12:35.341 --> 13:12:35.908
SUPPORT THIS BILL IS THE FRONT

13:12:35.975 --> 13:12:37.276
END.

13:12:37.343 --> 13:12:39.445
NEXT SESSION THERE ARE SOME

13:12:39.511 --> 13:12:42.214
POSITIVE THINGS WE CAN DO FOR

13:12:42.281 --> 13:12:44.550
THE FUTURE ONE OF THEM IS HAVE

13:12:44.617 --> 13:12:46.585
THE POWER COMPANIES THE FOUR

13:12:46.652 --> 13:12:48.954
MAIN ELECTRICAL POWER COMPANIES

13:12:49.021 --> 13:12:50.522
ESTABLISH A JOINT POWER

13:12:50.589 --> 13:12:52.291
AUTHORITY.

13:12:52.358 --> 13:12:54.126
SO THE TAKEN PRE FUND SOME OF

13:12:54.193 --> 13:12:56.262
THESE CLAIMS.

13:12:56.328 --> 13:12:58.931
WITH THAT JOINT POWER AUTHORITY

13:12:58.998 --> 13:13:03.402
THEY CAN ALSO ADD RE INSURANCE

13:13:03.469 --> 13:13:05.237
FOR CATASTROPHIC CLAIMS.

13:13:05.304 --> 13:13:07.706
SO THERE PREFONTAINE THAT

13:13:07.773 --> 13:13:09.608
ESTABLISHES THE RISK FOR WALL

13:13:09.675 --> 13:13:11.610
STREET THAT ESTABLISHES THE RISK

13:13:11.677 --> 13:13:13.445
LEVEL FOR THE STOCKHOLDERS IT

13:13:13.512 --> 13:13:15.114
JUST BECOMES.

13:13:15.180 --> 13:13:17.283
A PART OF DOING BUSINESS

13:13:17.349 --> 13:13:17.583
[inaudible]

13:13:17.650 --> 13:13:20.419
NUMBER.

13:13:20.486 --> 13:13:22.388
TWO THE INSURANCE SERVICES

13:13:22.454 --> 13:13:24.857
ORGANIZATION I SO THEY'RE THE

13:13:24.924 --> 13:13:26.992
ONES THAT DETERMINE ALL THE FIRE

13:13:27.059 --> 13:13:29.628
AREAS AND BASICALLY DETERMINE

13:13:29.695 --> 13:13:31.597
LEVEL ONE THROUGH FOUR HOW MUCH

13:13:31.664 --> 13:13:32.564
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR

13:13:32.631 --> 13:13:34.500
INSURANCE PREMIUM.

13:13:34.566 --> 13:13:36.101
THEY'VE BEEN TRACKING THESE

13:13:36.168 --> 13:13:38.604
FIRES SINCE.

13:13:38.671 --> 13:13:40.439
NINETEEN FIFTY AND THE I ALSO

13:13:40.506 --> 13:13:42.641
AREAS ARE SET UP TO PROTECT

13:13:42.708 --> 13:13:44.810
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

13:13:44.877 --> 13:13:47.046
WE CAN LOOK AT THAT.

13:13:47.112 --> 13:13:49.114
IT'S SEE ABOUT REDOING THE I SO

13:13:49.181 --> 13:13:52.351
AREAS THAT COULD SAVE A LOT OF

13:13:52.418 --> 13:13:52.751
MONEY.

13:13:52.818 --> 13:13:55.154
ANOTHER ONE IS FAIR PLAN

13:13:55.220 --> 13:13:57.222
FINANCING THAT'S RUN BY THE

13:13:57.289 --> 13:13:59.525
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S OUR

13:13:59.591 --> 13:14:02.695
INSURANCE COMPANY BASICALLY.

13:14:02.761 --> 13:14:06.365
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE PUT

13:14:06.432 --> 13:14:06.899
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

13:14:06.966 --> 13:14:08.567
DOLLARS OR WHATEVER NUMBER

13:14:08.634 --> 13:14:10.369
EVERYBODY COMES UP WITH.

13:14:10.436 --> 13:14:13.205
THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THEIR RISK.

13:14:13.272 --> 13:14:13.706
THAT WOULD LOWERED THEIR

13:14:13.772 --> 13:14:17.376
PREMIUMS AND IT WOULD GIVE THEM

13:14:17.443 --> 13:14:19.311
A BASS LINE THAT THEY CAN

13:14:19.378 --> 13:14:22.047
ACTUALLY INSURER THESE PEOPLE

13:14:22.114 --> 13:14:23.716
THEIR END OF RED AREAS

13:14:23.782 --> 13:14:24.016
[inaudible]

13:14:24.083 --> 13:14:26.685
THEN LASTLY.

13:14:26.752 --> 13:14:28.887
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAS AN

13:14:28.954 --> 13:14:30.656
INCREDIBLE SYSTEM FOR

13:14:30.723 --> 13:14:32.858
CONTROLLING.

13:14:32.925 --> 13:14:33.959
THEIR GRIT.

13:14:34.026 --> 13:14:36.061
THEY'VE OF STAB US CAMERAS

13:14:36.128 --> 13:14:38.130
INFRARED ANOTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO

13:14:38.197 --> 13:14:40.265
DETECT FIRES THROUGHOUT THE GRID.

13:14:40.332 --> 13:14:42.001
THAT ALLOWS ANY SECTION OF THE

13:14:42.067 --> 13:14:44.470
GRID TO BE POWERED DOWN. FOR

13:14:44.536 --> 13:14:47.172
FIRE LIGHTENING ANOTHER THREATS

13:14:47.239 --> 13:14:48.374
ASUS ESTATE.

13:14:48.440 --> 13:14:50.175
HAD THAT SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING

13:14:50.242 --> 13:14:53.078
RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE A OF WEATHER

13:14:53.145 --> 13:14:54.513
CENTER.

13:14:54.580 --> 13:14:57.483
AND THE LAST TOUR THREE FIRES

13:14:57.549 --> 13:14:58.817
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE.

13:14:58.884 --> 13:15:00.753
TO PAY HIM NAYLA SO THE

13:15:00.819 --> 13:15:02.354
FIREFIGHTERS CAN GO IN THERE AND

13:15:02.421 --> 13:15:05.557
SAFELY PUT OUT THE FIRES AND IF

13:15:05.624 --> 13:15:07.960
THERE'S LIGHTNING HER BIG STORMS.

13:15:08.027 --> 13:15:09.995
THEY CAN SHUT DOWN THEIR POWER

13:15:10.062 --> 13:15:12.965

13:56:11.488 --> 13:56:12.722
TO ME.

13:56:12.789 --> 13:56:13.923
BECAUSE TONY THURMOND WAS MY

13:56:13.990 --> 13:56:17.260
SEAT MATE. FOR MY FIRST

13:56:17.327 --> 13:56:17.560

AS MY SEAT MATE.

13:56:20.463 --> 13:56:22.632
HE WAS MY MENTOR.

13:56:22.699 --> 13:56:23.633
AND HE WAS REALLY THE PERFECT

13:56:23.700 --> 13:56:24.701
MENTOR FOR ME [inaudible]

13:56:24.767 --> 13:56:29.005
BECAUSE HE HAS OF WISDOM.

13:56:29.072 --> 13:56:31.007
ABOUT HIM THAT HE EXUDES EVERY

13:56:31.074 --> 13:56:32.742
TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.

13:56:32.809 --> 13:56:34.110
AND SPEAK SO ELOQUENTLY AS HE

13:56:34.177 --> 13:56:35.879
ALWAYS DOES.

13:56:35.945 --> 13:56:38.147
EMPLEOS OFF THE CUFF ON SUBJECTS

13:56:38.214 --> 13:56:40.483
THAT IMPASSIONED HIM.

13:56:40.550 --> 13:56:42.652
AND WHEN HE CHOOSES TO SPEAK HE

13:56:42.719 --> 13:56:43.253
SPEAKS THE SAME WAY THAT HE

13:56:43.319 --> 13:56:44.654
VOTES AND THAT'S WITH A

13:56:44.721 --> 13:56:46.789
RIGHTEOUSNESS.

13:56:46.856 --> 13:56:48.791
THAT ALWAYS IMPRESSES ME.

13:56:48.858 --> 13:56:50.360

13:56:50.426 --> 13:56:51.828
AND A HALF THAT WE SAT TOGETHER

13:56:51.895 --> 13:56:53.429
I CAN THINK OF ONE TIME THAT WE

13:56:53.496 --> 13:56:55.198
VOTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND NOT

13:56:55.265 --> 13:56:56.132
JUST BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS PRESS MY

13:56:56.199 --> 13:56:57.100

AYE ON SO MANY THINGS --

13:57:07.544 --> 13:57:09.646
BUT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT HE

13:57:09.712 --> 13:57:11.848
REALLY --

13:57:11.915 --> 13:57:13.917
IMPRESSED HIMSELF ON ME AND MADE

13:57:13.983 --> 13:57:15.785
AN IMPACT ON ME IS.

13:57:15.852 --> 13:57:17.754
THE COMMUNIST BY WHICH HE

13:57:17.820 --> 13:57:19.822
CARRIES HIMSELF.

13:57:19.889 --> 13:57:21.424
HE DOESN'T GET EXCITED AND HE

13:57:21.491 --> 13:57:23.226
DOESN'T GET ANGRY [inaudible]

13:57:23.293 --> 13:57:25.295
HE'S DETERMINED.

13:57:25.361 --> 13:57:28.197
AND HE'S FORCEFUL WHEN HE SPEAKS

13:57:28.264 --> 13:57:29.899
BUT HE DOES IT WITH HIS WISDOM.

13:57:29.966 --> 13:57:31.701
AND NOT WITH HIS TONE.

13:57:31.768 --> 13:57:32.969
AND EVERY TIME I WOULD WATCH HIM

13:57:33.036 --> 13:57:33.803
SPEAK I WOULD SIT THERE AND

13:57:33.870 --> 13:57:36.072

ONE OF OUR STONE WALL MEETINGS

14:28:47.175 --> 14:28:48.843
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

14:28:48.910 --> 14:28:50.044
AND WHILE THE SPEECH WAS RUNNING

14:28:50.111 --> 14:28:51.579

TRAIN CAUCUS.

14:28:55.550 --> 14:28:56.350
WHERE WE LIVE THERE'S NOT A LOT

14:28:56.417 --> 14:28:58.085
OF TRAINS GOING THROUGH A LOT OF

14:28:58.152 --> 14:28:59.821
TIME SPENT IN CARS UP AND DOWN

14:28:59.887 --> 14:29:01.355

14:29:01.422 --> 14:29:02.790
THE FIVE AND UP AND DOWN?

14:29:02.857 --> 14:29:05.126
ROADS WHERE THERE'S NO SELF

SERVICE A LOT OF PLACES IN --

14:29:06.961 --> 14:29:08.429
BUT SHE AND ONE WOULD COME UP

14:29:08.496 --> 14:29:09.630
AND DOWN AND TALK WITH PEOPLE

14:29:09.697 --> 14:29:11.132
AND MEET WITH PEOPLE IN.

14:29:11.199 --> 14:29:12.200
A MINUTE THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

14:29:12.266 --> 14:29:14.135
THINGS THAT I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED

14:29:14.202 --> 14:29:15.470

14:29:15.536 --> 14:29:18.372
TENACITY HER HARD WORK --

14:29:18.439 --> 14:29:19.240
HER SPEAKING OUT FOR RULE

14:29:19.307 --> 14:29:21.209
CALIFORNIA.

14:29:21.275 --> 14:29:22.643
AND FOR THE UNIQUE ISSUES THAT

14:29:22.710 --> 14:29:24.045
PEOPLE FACE WHEN THEY LIVE

14:29:24.111 --> 14:29:25.580
WITHOUT RESOURCES AND THEY LIVE

14:29:25.646 --> 14:29:26.948
WITHOUT CLEAN AIR AND THEY LIVE

14:29:27.014 --> 14:29:28.483
WITHOUT CLEAN ATER.

14:29:28.549 --> 14:29:29.784
AND THEY LIVE WITHOUT GOOD

14:29:29.851 --> 14:29:31.319
QUALITY SCHOOLS AND THEY STILL

14:29:31.385 --> 14:29:33.087
WANT REPRESENTATIONS ALL OF THE

14:29:33.154 --> 14:29:35.056
THINGS THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS.

14:29:35.122 --> 14:29:35.723
AND YET THEY'RE NOT A SIMPLE TO

14:29:35.790 --> 14:29:36.624
GET.

14:29:36.691 --> 14:29:37.725
WHEN YOU LIVE IN AREAS THAT ARE

14:29:37.792 --> 14:29:40.094
OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS SO

14:29:40.161 --> 14:29:41.562
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

14:29:41.629 --> 14:29:44.332
STRONG ARTICULATE VOICES? TO

14:29:44.398 --> 14:29:46.501
SPEAK ON YOUR BEHALF AND TO BE

14:29:46.567 --> 14:29:47.401
ABLE THE HOUSE PASSED

14:29:47.468 --> 14:29:48.903
LEGISLATION ON YOUR BEHALF AND

14:29:48.970 --> 14:29:49.837
TO BE ABLE.

14:29:49.904 --> 14:29:51.172
TO HELP OTHER MEMBERS UNDERSTAND

14:29:51.239 --> 14:29:53.241
THAT CALIFORNIA'S MORE THAN.

14:29:53.307 --> 14:29:54.475
THEN THE AND THEN JUST THE COAST

14:29:54.542 --> 14:29:56.377
THAT IT IT IT IS IT IS IT IS

14:29:56.444 --> 14:29:58.613
FARMS IT IS FARMWORKERS AND IT

14:29:58.679 --> 14:29:59.113
IS.

14:29:59.180 --> 14:30:00.348
THE FABRIC OF THOSE PEOPLE'S

14:30:00.414 --> 14:30:02.450
LIVES TO HELP MAKE UP OUR STORY

14:30:02.517 --> 14:30:04.852
IN OUR REALITY.

14:30:04.919 --> 14:30:06.487
AFTER SHE LEFT THE ASSEMBLY SHE

14:30:06.554 --> 14:30:08.856
WAS A SECRETARY FOR JOBS AND AND

14:30:08.923 --> 14:30:10.992
NOT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

14:30:11.058 --> 14:30:11.759
AND THEY CAME BACK INTO THIS

14:30:11.826 --> 14:30:13.227

14:30:13.294 --> 14:30:15.429
SERVING.

14:30:15.496 --> 14:30:16.397
AND AS A CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S

14:30:16.464 --> 14:30:17.765
CAUCUS I COULD SAY IT IS BEEN AN

14:30:17.832 --> 14:30:19.267
HONOR TO SERVE WITH ON A

14:30:19.333 --> 14:30:21.168
CABALLERO WHEN SHE GAVE YOU HER

14:30:21.235 --> 14:30:23.838
WORD SHE KEEPS IT.

14:30:23.905 --> 14:30:24.906
AND SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO DO

14:30:24.972 --> 14:30:26.641
SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T.

14:30:26.707 --> 14:30:27.808
AND WHEN SHE TOLD YOU SHE CAN'T

14:30:27.875 --> 14:30:29.010
DO SOMETHING IT SHOULD SAY THAT

14:30:29.076 --> 14:30:30.177
LOT MEMBERS LED MEMBERS THE

14:30:30.244 --> 14:30:31.312

14:30:31.379 --> 14:30:31.512
BILLS.

14:30:31.579 --> 14:30:32.547
NOW.

14:30:32.613 --> 14:30:33.714
IF SHE WAS HONEST AND SHE WAS

14:30:33.781 --> 14:30:35.583

14:30:37.552 --> 14:30:38.119
PERHAPS LONGER THAN YOU WANT TO

14:30:38.185 --> 14:30:39.287
HEAR.

14:30:39.353 --> 14:30:39.854
WHY SHE COULDN'T OR WHY SHE

14:30:39.921 --> 14:30:41.556
WOULDN'T?

14:30:41.622 --> 14:30:42.823

14:30:42.890 --> 14:30:44.358
REASONED.

14:30:49.363 --> 14:30:52.166
REPRESENTATIVE OF HER COMMUNITY.

14:30:52.233 --> 14:30:53.467
AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN

14:30:53.534 --> 14:30:55.536
ASK ANY MORE THAN A POPE FROM A

14:30:55.603 --> 14:30:56.604
PUBLIC SERVANT IS TO SERVE WITH

14:30:56.671 --> 14:30:59.307

14:31:16.991 --> 14:31:18.259

14:48:34.928 --> 14:48:36.096
THAT AGAIN.

14:48:36.162 --> 14:48:37.197
SO WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS

14:48:37.263 --> 14:48:38.898
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE OUR

14:48:38.965 --> 14:48:41.167
ECONOMY IS RUNNING RUNNING THAT.

14:48:41.234 --> 14:48:42.235
THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING

14:48:42.302 --> 14:48:44.004
POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE

14:48:44.070 --> 14:48:45.538
NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

14:48:45.605 --> 14:48:47.540
AND WHAT HAS BEEN GREAT IT'S

14:48:47.607 --> 14:48:50.844
BEEN ABLE TO SEE YOU ADVOCATE.

14:48:50.910 --> 14:48:53.480
FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT.

14:48:53.546 --> 14:48:57.751
BUT TO DO IT TOGETHER AND IT'S

14:48:57.817 --> 14:49:00.286
MY EXPERIENCE THAT.

14:49:00.353 --> 14:49:02.255
THAT IF YOU GET PEOPLE IN A ROOM

14:49:02.322 --> 14:49:03.256
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE

14:49:03.323 --> 14:49:05.125
COMMON VALUES ARE.

14:49:05.191 --> 14:49:07.293
AT YOU USUALLY CAN GET TO A

14:49:07.360 --> 14:49:08.662
RESOLUTION AT THE END.

14:49:08.728 --> 14:49:10.664
AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET

14:49:10.730 --> 14:49:11.831
IN A ROOM AND TALK ABOUT OUR

14:49:11.898 --> 14:49:13.266
VALUES TALK ABOUT.

14:49:13.333 --> 14:49:15.468
RAISING CHILDREN TALK ABOUT THE

14:49:15.535 --> 14:49:17.237
IMPORTANCE OF FOSTER.

14:49:17.303 --> 14:49:19.472
FOSTER CHILDREN AND SUPPORTING

14:49:19.539 --> 14:49:21.408
THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD

14:49:21.474 --> 14:49:25.478
pGOOD JOB.

14:49:25.545 --> 14:49:26.046
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH

14:49:26.112 --> 14:49:27.147
DIGNITY.

14:49:27.213 --> 14:49:28.982
THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET

14:49:29.049 --> 14:49:30.917
AROUND WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE A

14:49:30.984 --> 14:49:32.452
VEHICLE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

14:49:32.519 --> 14:49:33.953
ARE ISSUES THAT.

14:49:34.020 --> 14:49:35.155
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

14:49:35.221 --> 14:49:39.659
FOCUS ON AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT

14:49:39.726 --> 14:49:41.227
THIS JOB IS THAT I GET TO TALK

14:49:41.294 --> 14:49:43.263
ABOUT WHAT I REALLY LOVE.

14:49:43.329 --> 14:49:45.665
AND I WAS NOT RAISED IN RURAL

14:49:45.732 --> 14:49:47.534
CALIFORNIA I WAS RAISED IN

14:49:47.600 --> 14:49:48.601
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT

14:49:48.668 --> 14:49:49.736
THERE'S NOTHING ROTH THERE'S A

14:49:49.803 --> 14:49:51.104
LITTLE BIT GIRL IN SPANISH

14:49:51.171 --> 14:49:52.405
CALIFORNIA BUT THERE'S NOT A

14:49:52.472 --> 14:49:53.306
WHOLE HECK OF A LOT.

14:49:53.373 --> 14:49:54.674
ACTUALLY FIGHT WHEN I WAS

14:49:54.741 --> 14:49:56.209
GROWING UP THERE WERE A LOT

14:49:56.276 --> 14:49:58.211
ORANGE TREES ALL THAT'S GONE --

14:49:58.278 --> 14:49:59.913
AND THAT'S PROBABLY IT A STORY

14:49:59.979 --> 14:50:01.081
FOR ANOTHER DAY TO TALK ABOUT IF

14:50:01.147 --> 14:50:03.883
WE'RE NOT WISE STEWARDS THIS IS

14:50:03.950 --> 14:50:05.785
WHY LIBERAL CALIFORNIA IS THAT

14:50:05.852 --> 14:50:07.654
WHAT I WHAT I LEARNED MOVING TO

14:50:07.721 --> 14:50:09.689
RURAL CALIFORNIA IS THAT HARD

14:50:09.756 --> 14:50:11.891
WORKING PEOPLE MAKE IT HAPPEN.

14:50:11.958 --> 14:50:13.793
AND THEIR DEDICATION TO TAKING

14:50:13.860 --> 14:50:15.595
CARE OF THE EARTH BECAUSE

14:50:15.662 --> 14:50:16.896
OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A

14:50:16.963 --> 14:50:19.966
GOOD CROP IS REALLY COMPLETE AND

14:50:20.033 --> 14:50:21.668
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GET UP AT

14:50:21.735 --> 14:50:23.403
THREE O'CLOCK EVERY DAY AND GO

14:50:23.470 --> 14:50:25.004
OUT TO THE FIELDS AND WORK.

14:50:25.071 --> 14:50:26.906
AND AND THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR

14:50:26.973 --> 14:50:29.776
A GOOD SALARY A THE ABILITY TO

14:50:29.843 --> 14:50:31.177
RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR

14:50:31.244 --> 14:50:32.512
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN

14:50:32.579 --> 14:50:33.546
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE MOST OF

14:50:33.613 --> 14:50:35.582
THEM -- CAME

14:50:35.648 --> 14:50:37.350
HERE LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE.

14:50:37.417 --> 14:50:38.618
AND WHAT I LEARNED OUT OF ALL OF

14:50:38.685 --> 14:50:40.720
THAT IS THAT THERE IS TREMENDOUS

14:50:40.787 --> 14:50:43.223
OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE. TO CHANGE

14:50:43.289 --> 14:50:44.891
THE COMMUNITY AND TO REALLY BE

14:50:44.958 --> 14:50:46.760
ABLE TO TO DO GOOD THINGS SO

14:50:46.826 --> 14:50:48.194
THAT THOSE KIDS DO HAVE AN

14:50:48.261 --> 14:50:49.763
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CHANCE IN

14:50:49.829 --> 14:50:50.764
THE GET A GOOD EDUCATION AND GET

14:50:50.830 --> 14:50:52.499
A GOOD JOB.

14:50:52.565 --> 14:50:54.234
BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL.

14:50:54.300 --> 14:50:55.869
ON THEN WE'RE GONNA LOSE

14:50:55.935 --> 14:50:56.436
AGRICULTURE AND THAT'S WHAT

14:50:56.503 --> 14:50:57.837
WORRIES ME.

14:50:57.904 --> 14:51:00.740
AND SO I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR

14:51:00.807 --> 14:51:02.108
THE PEOPLE.

14:51:02.175 --> 14:51:04.744
I LOVE THE HARD WORK I LOVE THIS

14:51:04.811 --> 14:51:07.781
SOIL I LOVE THE THE FEELING OF

14:51:07.847 --> 14:51:09.482
BEING OUT IN.

14:51:09.549 --> 14:51:13.553
OPEN OPEN FIELDS --

14:51:13.620 --> 14:51:18.024
AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TO

14:51:18.091 --> 14:51:19.058
EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT

14:51:19.125 --> 14:51:19.826
CALIFORNIA AND IF WE'RE NOT

14:51:19.893 --> 14:51:21.995
CAREFUL LOSING --

14:51:22.061 --> 14:51:23.396
SO THAT'S WHY I KIND OF FEEL

14:51:23.463 --> 14:51:25.398
LIKE I'VE GOT TO BE HERE.

14:51:25.465 --> 14:51:26.032
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I

14:51:26.099 --> 14:51:27.667
KEEP COMING BACK ALL THE TIME

14:51:27.734 --> 14:51:30.303

14:51:30.370 --> 14:51:32.005
THAT I AM SO DEDICATED TO MAKING

14:51:32.071 --> 14:51:33.673
SURE THAT.

14:51:33.740 --> 14:51:34.874
THAT THAT THAT DOOR STAYS OPEN

14:51:34.941 --> 14:51:36.676
THAT WE REALLY DO LOOK AT WAYS

14:51:36.743 --> 14:51:38.077
TO BE ABLE --

14:51:38.144 --> 14:51:39.679

14:51:41.181 --> 14:51:43.316
AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS

14:51:43.383 --> 14:51:44.450
SUSTAINABLE.

14:51:44.517 --> 14:51:45.919
AND THAT PROVIDES A LIVING A

14:51:45.985 --> 14:51:47.520
GOOD LIVING FOR THE FAMILIES

14:51:47.587 --> 14:51:48.922
THAT HAVE DECIDED THAT THAT'S

14:51:48.988 --> 14:51:50.790
