THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I COME TO PRESENT EIGHTY THREE OH SEVEN A GRANTS PROGRAM WHICH WOULD AWARD FUNDS TO NON PROFITS OR CONTINUUM OF CARE ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES. TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AS YOU MAY KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IN THE NATION WITH OVER 54% OF THE NATION'S TOTAL NUMBER OF HOMELESS. HOMELESS YOUTH RESIDING HERE I CAT IN CAT ON THE CALIFORNIA STREETS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER ONE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED. HOMELESS YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT WITHOUT A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME. AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE HUNDRED PARENTING YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ALONGSIDE THEIR CHILDREN. UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE PREDICAMENTS IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. WITH ONLY TWENTY OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVING DIRECT SERVICES FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB THREE OH SEVEN A GRANT PROGRAM TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL LOCAL PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE AND CULTURALLY INFORMED WRAPAROUND SERVICES ENHANCING EFFORTS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO COMBAT YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. THERE'S SIMPLY NO REASON THAT THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY SHOULD HAVE SUCH A HUGE POPULATION OF YOUTH LIVING ON THE STREETS RATHER THAN RECEIVING CRITICAL SERVICES. WELL THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED SOME FUNDS TO COMBAT HOUSING ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. A DEDICATED FUNDING. SUPPORT PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS TRULY WHAT IS NEEDED. HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME ON BEHALF OF THIS MEASURE ARE KIM LEWIS AND GIOVANE WILKES FROM CALIFORNIA COALITION. FOR YOUTH. HI THANK YOU. WHEN HE WAS DIVINE WORKS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOU? NOW WATCH OUT TO IMAGINE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. TO INDOOR WEEKS OF EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON THE SIDEWALK. I DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE BECAUSE I WAS ONCE HOMELESS AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN ON THE SIDEWALK. TRYING TO MAKE IT THROUGH -- I WAS UNSAFE AND NOT WELCOMED AT MY HOME. WHILE GROWING UP TOO OVERWHELMING AMOUNTS OF ADVERSITY BEEN A HOME ISSUE COULD HAVE BEEN DEBILITATING. HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR SUPPORT FROM A SCHOOL PSYCHIATRIST. AND THE HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTER. THAT WAS PROVIDED THROUGH THE CAT THE LOS ANGELES YOU -- NETWORK -- NOW KNOWN AS THE YOUTH EMPOWERMENT -- YOUTH EMERGING STRONG. THERE HAVE SUPPORT OF ADULTS AND MENTORS ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE. ACCESS TO EDUCATION SUPPORT BOOT SHOWER A BED AND A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. ONE WEEKS ON THE STREETS ALONE HAVING TO FIND WAYS TO EAT. STAY CLEAN GET TO SCHOOL STAYING SAFE AND HOPING FOR AN UNINTERRUPTED NIGHT OF SLEEP. BARN DOOR HOMELESSNESS DURING THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. THAT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE ESPECIALLY OUR YOUTH. I'VE SEEN A TIME WHILE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT BEDS DROP IN CENTERS AND YOUTH SHELTERS DECREASED. CAPACITY AND EVEN SOME CLOSE THEIR DOORS. TODAY I HOPE TO SEE AND LIVE IN A TIME WHERE YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IS RARE. SHORT LIVED NON RECURRING. AND THAT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED TO YOUTH. TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. YOUR TIME IS MUCH APPRECIATED AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SHARE.

EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY FIVE EXPANSE TRAINING CURRICULUM PROVIDED TO FOSTER YOUTH RESOURCE FAMILIES TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SPECIFICALLY THE TRAINING FOCUSES ON RISK FACTORS FOR COMMERCIAL AND SEXUALLY EXPLOITATION AND LABOR TRAFFICKING. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A CRITICAL ISSUE WHERE IN THE US CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS ONE YEAR OLD ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO EXPLOITATION. CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE OF DOMESTIC MINOR SEX TRAFFICKING INDICATES THAT 7585% OF SURVIVORS WERE IN FOSTER CARE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR ADOLESCENCE. THE FBI ESTIMATES THAT OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING ANNUALLY AND FOSTER YOUTH MAKE UP 60% OF CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. THE REST TO THIS POPULATION IS CLEAR BUT CARE GIVERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE YOUTH ARE NOT PROVIDED. THE ACCESS TO PROPER TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO BETTER SUPPORT THIS POPULATION WE MUST DO BETTER. AB EIGHT SIXTY FIVE ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS BY PROVIDING RESOURCE FAMILIES WITH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS POPULATION. THROUGH THIS EDUCATION RESOURCE FAMILIES WILL BE PROPERLY EDUCATED ON HOW TO CARE FOR THESE YOUTH IN AN APPROPRIATE AND LOVING MANNER.

GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JORDAN SOSA AND SERVE AS A STATEWIDE POLICY COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTION ALSO FORMER FOSTER YOU FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND SERVE AS A C. YC MEMBER THROUGH THE ORANGE COUNTY CHAPTER. A FEW THINGS TO KNOW FOR A. B. ONCE A FIVE FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE MANY STRIDES AND PROGRESS FOR THE FOSTER YOUTH IN TERMS OF HOUSING HIGHER EDUCATION PARTIALLY DUE TO THE WORK THAT MANY FOLKS IN THE ROOM HAS BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES THAT FOSTER YOUTH FACE EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WERE VERY DIFFERENT THOSE THERE WERE FACE TODAY AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT OUR PROGRESS AND PROTECTIONS MATCHES ACCORDINGLY. I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL BE ONE STEPPING STONE CLOSER TO THAT -- ONE THING THEY GAIN THROUGH MY ADVOCACY WITH CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTION AND UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL ISSUES ARE HAPPENING WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WAS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF MY RIGHTS AS OF CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BEING SEPARATED FROM MY SIBLINGS OR BE IN TONIGHT TO MAKE PHONE CALLS TO MY SIBLINGS OR BEING IN CHARGE TO USE ELECTRONICS IN THE HOME WAS A VIOLATION OF MY RIGHTS. AS AN ORGANIZATION IT IS OUR VISION TO ADVOCATE FOR ALL FOSS YOUTH. AND EMPHASIZE IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE PEOPLE PUT COULD BE EQUAL PARTNERS IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE POLICIES AND THE DECISIONS THEY MADE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. ALL OF YOU THE FOSTER CARE NEED TO HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET -- I'M SAYING THIS AS THE STREETS THIS MAIL IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE MY PRIVILEGE AND TO ADVOCATE FOR THE LGBTQ YOUTH WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE. WE BELIEVE THE A B. TWELVE WILL MAKE THESE DIRECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE THE RIGHTS THAT GIBSON HAS LISTED. AND LIKE WE SAID THAT OUR VISION IS TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR MEETS NET TO SUPPORT TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT ADULTS. WE WILL HEAR OF COMMENTS ON THE OPPOSITION WHY BUT ONE COMMENT AND QUOTE THAT MY CIAC MEMBER MADE THROUGH MY WORK IN CALIFORNIA WITH CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTION. SHE SAID IF TRAUMA COULD BE PASSED DOWN THROUGHOUT GENERATIONS. THEN SO CAN HEALING. SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT WE WOULD BE PASSING DOWN TO OUR YOUTH SO WE PREFERRED ROUTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A A VOTE FOR THIS LEGISLATION. AS PART OF AS I HAVE MY BACK TO THAT PERSON SO I APOLOGIZE ARRAYED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LINDA DO HERE'S TO I'M A COKE PASTOR OF THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN SACRAMENTO WE CALL OURSELVES THE TABLE HI. IN OUR CHURCH IN SACRAMENTO ARE FOSTER PARENTS AND FOSTER CHILDREN. AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALS IN THE FOSTERING SYSTEM AND I MYSELF AM AN ADOPTIVE MOM. MY FAMILY IS PART OF AN OPEN ADOPTION AND WE ARE IN -- FULL LOVING COMMUNITY WITH OUR SON'S BIRTH MOM AND HIS BIRTH SIBLINGS AND SHE HERSELF WAS -- PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FOSTERING SYSTEM. SOMETIME AGO I SERVED ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE TEAM IN NAPA COUNTY WHICH SUPPORTED FOSTER FAMILIES WHO FOSTER TEENAGERS TO FIND WAYS. TO COMMUNICATE AND BUILD TRUST AND REALLY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES. I KNOW THAT FOSTER CHILDREN BEGIN BY EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF SEPARATION FROM THEIR FAMILY FOR ANY VARIETY OF REASONS. AND AS A UNITED METHODIST PASTOR I BELIEVE ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. AND WITH DIGNITY REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY OR THEIR RELIGIONSO IN ORDER FOR THE WORK OF OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED A INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT BARRIERS AND EXPERIENCES. THE CHILDREN HAVE AROUND RACE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND RELIGION MAY CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL WORKERS. AND THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BE CALM OR BE FOSTER PARENTS. SO AS A PASTOR SUPPORTING A LOT OF OF FOSTER PARENTS I BELIEVE IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A FOSTER PARENT TO PROVIDE THE ABSOLUTE BEST. LOVING AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR FOSTER CHILD OR CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF WHO THE CHILD IDENTIFIES AS OR WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK TOWARD FULL INCLUSION FOR FOSTER USE IS. HARD WORK IN ITS VARIED AND IT'S COMPLEX -- THEREFORE I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO MODERNIZE THE FOSTERED USE. BILL F RIGHTS FOR ALL OF US SO THAT IT ADDRESSES CURRENT CULTURAL COMPETENCIES. AND AMONG THOSE ARE LIFTING UP THE RIGHTS OF NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN UNDER OUR INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT. TO RECEIVE GROOMING AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS. WHICH THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD WANT TEENAGERS TO ALWAYS HAVE REGARDLESS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY ANDTO ATTEND A CULTURAL ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT. WITH THEIR IDENTITY AS WELL AS FINALLY TO BE REFERRED TO BY THEIR PREFERRED NAME AND THEIR GENDER PRONOUNS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU -- HEARING ME TODAY THANK YOU. I WOULD HAVE SEND YOUR SUBCOMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. I TRIED WITH INTREPID I IT ABSOLUTELY WE DO TAKE REMEMBERS ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

PLEASE COME UP IT JUST THREE MINUTES GO AHEAD. THANK YOU DUMB. MY NAME'S GREG BIRDS -- CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- I WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME SOME OF THE CONCERNS WITH JUST SOME OF THESE RIGHTS. THEY'RE BEING ESTABLISHED THAT I THINK IS WORTH A DISCUSSION -- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOUR SYSTEM IS SET UP TO PROTECT KIDS FROM BEING EXPLOITED -- INTO INSURE THEIR SAFETY SO. I THINK THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK IS DO ALL THESE RIGHTS ACTUALLY KEEP KIDS SAFE. SO HERE'S SOME OF THE ONES THAT -- WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- OF THE RIGHTS TO THE INTERNET -- DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN AGE ON HERE I KNOW MY LIVER NEAR OLD SON. DOESN'T HAVE UNLIMITED RIGHTS THE INTERNET'S -- SOME CONCERN ABOUT THAT HOUSE AT THE FIND -- HERE'S ANOTHER THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TO MAKE. SEND RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL PHONE CALLS AND LIKE TRYING TO COMMUNICATIONS. I'M ASSUMING THIS MEANS EMAILS TEXTING AND SNAIL MAIL. TO OKAY MY ELEVEN YOUR WHOLE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE CONFIDENTIAL PHONE CALLS. BECAUSE I'M OUT TO PROTECT HIM RIGHT AND IT AND LIVE TWO GIRLS AS WELL AND SO I'M INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES I WANNA MAKE SURE ADULTS ARE NOT. ENOUGH TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEM -- OTHER THE NEXT ONE OF THE RIGHT AT ANY AGE TO GET ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION. ABORTION SEXUAL SOLD HEALTH CARE. WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT OF ANY ADULT -- I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY THAT WOULD. BE IN THE BEST DIFFERENCE BEST INTEREST OF FOSTER KIDS -- L. ANOTHER ONE THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES OF PERSONAL BELONGINGS. OKAY WHEN I I USED TO WORK FOR SENATOR WALTERS DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS IN CHARGE OF WAS. A SEX TRAFFICKING AND SO I GOT A TOUR OF THE ORANGE WOULD GROUP HOME AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- THEY TOLD US DOWN THERE IS IS THAT. JUST SOMETHING WE JUST HEARD THE LAST HEARING THAT FOSTER KIDS ARE VERY VULNERABLE TO BEING TRAFFICKED. AND THEY WOULD ACTUALLY DO THE TRAFFICKERS WAS ACTUALLY RECRUIT KIDS INTO TRAFFICKING AND THEN THEY WOULD SEND THEM BACK INTO THE HOME TO RECRUIT THE OTHER KIDS -- AND WE'LL DO KNOWING THESE NEW RIGHTS I THINK THIS IS THE TRAFFICKERS ARE GONNA LOVE THIS -- BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH KIDS AND THE FOSTER CARE PARENTS AND OVERSEERS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT ANYTHING IS HAPPENING -- ANOTHER RIGHT THAT'S ESTABLISHED FOSTER CARE PARENTS CAN'T THREATENED TO CALL POLICE I'M NOT. LOVE TO HAVE THAT EXPLAIN TO ME -- AND THEN ALSO THE RIGHT -- THIS BEING ESTABLISHED TO BE REFERRED TO BY THE PREFERRED NAME IN PRONOUN NO MATTER WHAT THE AGE OF THE CHILD -- WITH OUR ORGANIZATION A LOT OF FOLKS -- WITH RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WITH VERY TRADITIONAL VIEWS ON GENDER AND SEXUALITY AND A LOT OF THEM WERE APPALLED FOSTER CARE. AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS BY FORCING. ARE THESE PARENTS TO A FIRM -- BELIEVES THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN -- THAT'S GOING TO PUSH THOSE KIDS OUT OF FOSTER CARE THAT NO THOSE KIDS WITH THE PARENTS OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO. FOR THOSE EASONS -- WERE IN OPPOSITION THANKS. SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE GENERAL FOR A RAISING OF THE SAME QUESTIONS AS HE DID AND THE ASSEMBLY -- HUMAN SERVICES -- LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS -- FOR INSTANCE -- THROUGH A MEMBER TODD GLORIA HAD ALREADY -- MADE -- CODIFIED -- LAW IN -- IN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE AND NINETEEN THEY TALKED ABOUT GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. A LOT OF THE BILLS THAT -- THE GERMAN SPOKE ABOUT WE BRING IT TOGETHER. AND WE'RE PUTTING IT INTO THE POLICY THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS A LOSS THESE ARE ALREADY LAWS THAT THESE YOU ALREADY HAVE. BUT THEIR PLACE IN DIFFERENT PLACES WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO IS PLACE THIS INTO THE BALL TO YOU BILL OF RIGHTS WITH DS ASK HAS ALREADY -- ACQUIESCE IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THIS IN TERMS OF MAKING THIS BILL -- BETTER -- WHEN IT COMES -- TO YOU KNOW. NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO CALL THE POLICE CERTAINLY A PARENT HAS THE ABILITY IN TERMS OF CALLING THE POLICE SPECIALLY IF IN FACT SOMEONE'S LIFE ISN'T IN DANGER -- RAISE THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT A CHILD -- NAMES PRO NOW RIGHT WELL. YOU SHOULD BE WANTED TO IF YOU'RE BRINGING A CHILD IN AS A FOSTER YOU INTO YOUR HOME -- THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A STRUCTURE AS A GOAL THERE IS ALSO PROVIDE -- LOVING GUIDANCE -- AT THAT TIME I WANT TO BE CALLED BY THEIR PRO NOW THEN YOU SHOULD DO JUST THAT DO YOU WANT TO FURTHER STIGMATIZE -- OUR CHILDREN AND TRAUMATIZED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MOST VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TODAY AND WE WANT TO TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO LOVE THEM. I'M JUST SHOW THEM LOVE -- NOT PERSECUTE THEM -- NOT FURTHER DISENFRANCHISE THEM -- NOT TRY TO MAKE THEM TO BE SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT -- THEY'RE NOT ALREADY RIGHT AND SO THIS BILL SEEKS. TO ALLOW ON THE FALSE TEETH BILL OF RIGHTS TO HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS DON'T WE WANT KIDS TO HAVE A ACCESS TO HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND AND GROOMING. WHY WE WERE WE WILL PUT THIS IN HERE? WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT THIS IN HERE IF IT WAS ALREADY BEING DONE. AND IT'S NOT BEING DONE THAT'S WHY WE PUT IT INTO LAW THE MAKING SURE THESE FOSTER YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS. UNDER THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS AND SO SENATORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I VOTE. FOR A B.. ONE SEVENTY FIVE WHAT EFFECT OF OUR HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

I THINK THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- SO ONE OF THOSE IN AND I GUES IT DOES TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON SERVE -- THIS APPLIES TO ALL FOSTER YOUTH THOUGH SO THEY SPEND THE AGE RANGE -- SO IN GENERAL I WOULD AGREE THAT -- THAT YOU KNOW PROBABLY AT AND OUR LESSON OR SOMEONE -- WITH THE ONES THAT USE YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FOR YOUR MEDICAL DENTAL CENTER AND IN IN IN PRINCIPLE I THINK THAT MAKES SO A LOT OF SENSE -- BUT AT SOME POINT IN TERMS OF THE AGE RANGE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE EVEN A TWELVE YEAR OLD OR A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD. WE THOUGHT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEAR OLDER THREE YEAR OLD AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW THESE HOW DO YOU SEE THIS OPERATIONALIZE AND EXACTLY WHAT IS RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. TO SEE THAT HOW HOW HOW IS THAT RIGHT FORCED FOR VERTICALLY A YEAH AT A VERY YOUNG CHILD. TO PERHAPS IS USUALLY NOT IN YOU KNOW MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AT THE AGE IN WHICH WE DON'T EXPECT TO MAKE THOSE CUTS THAT CAN DECISION I JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WATER SERVING WITH THE WOODEN AND THE THING IS A WORLD. YOU SOCIAL WORKERS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PLAY A ROLE RIGHT IN THIS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOSTER YOUTH HAVE. ADEQUATE CARE AND ACCESS TO THE ADEQUATE CARE -- WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO HELP KINDS OF DECISION MAKING ALONG WITH THE FOSTER CARE YEAH I? GUESS THAT -- IS THIS -- AT THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND BACK CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND IS FORD -- I THINK MAYBE SHOULD LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S AND THINK ABOUT PUTTING SOME PHRASES ABOUT YOU KNOW. A RELATION TO THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL YOU KNOW CAPACITY RIGHT I I JUST. I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT AS WE AS AS WE MOVE THIS YEAH. HOPEFULLY THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AND THOUGH EXACTLY HOW THEREFORE WHAT IS THE RISK CLEARLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTY YOU KNOW. THE OFFICE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THE WHAT THE STATE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT BUT TO YOUR PARENTS SO THAT THEIR SO THAT THERE ISN'T -- AND IT DOES SO THERE'S MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I THINK WE WANT TO EMPOWER FOSTER YOUTH.

ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WOULD ALSO EXEMPT CENSUS RELATED INCOME FROM EITHER GOVERNMENTAL OR NON PROFIT AGENCY TO ENCOURAGE CENSUS PARTICIPATION IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

I WATER FATHER THINKING YOU'RE MAKING TWENTY STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THE FILM WEEKS OF MAYBE IN THE NEXT. THANK YOU AB A SIXTY ARE TRYING TO COME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE BAND'S RECORD. WELL HOME WITH THIS IS NOT A REASON TO ENTER IN FOSTER CARE WE KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE YOU CLICK ON THE STREETS BECAUSE IT IS SAFER THAN THE HOME THAT THEY CAME FROM AND FORTUNATELY. THEY'RE OFTEN LIVING ON THE STREETS IN THEIR CARS OR BOUNCING FROM SHELTER TO SHELTER. WHEN THESE MINERS REPORTS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT GO UNDER INVESTIGATED THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS MID AFFIDAVIT? FOR A JV TO CONFORM TRIGGERING A FINAL TEMP GETS SOCIAL WORKERS INVESTIGATE THEIR CLAIM. WE SHOULD BE DOING WHATEVER IS NECESSARY RIGHT SAFETY SHELTER AND A SPEEDY PROCESS FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED. USE THIS BILL PRIORITIZES HOMELESS YOUTH YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT WERE FORMALLY BEEN DEPENDENT OF THE COURT PRODUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT SOCIAL WORKER HAS TO FILE. COMMENCED APPENDICES PROCEEDINGS OR NOT FROM THREE WEEKS TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS. WHICH IS A FOURTEEN CALENDAR DAYS. THE CASE OF WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKER DECIDE TO DO NOTHING AFTER THESE TEN BUSINESS DAYS THEN THE MINOR AND THEIR COUNSEL MAY SUBMIT A PETITION TO THECOURT TO REVIEW THE DECISION. IF THAT STEP WAS TAKEN THEN THIS BILL WILL GIVE THE COURT FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER FORM. A REVERSE DECISION BY THE SOCIAL WORKER. THIS PROCESS IS ONLY USED AS A LAST RESORT FOR USE WITH CALLS TO THE HEARTLAND HAD NOT BEEN ACTED ON THESE ARE KIDS THAT HAVE CONTINUOUS MAKE CLAIMS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT ARE NOW CONSIDER HOMELESS. PLEASE HELP ME TODAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS FASTER FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY SUPPORTERS BILLS CAN REALLY LEWIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH. AND PALMER VOCALS FROM BAY AREA LEGAL AID AND WHO HANDLES MANY OF THESE. CASES. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KHAN REVIEW TIME IS NOW TURNING AT BAY AREA LEGAL AID AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY ONE WHICH PROPOSES A MODERATE REDUCTION IN THE TIME LINE IN WHICH THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. MUST INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT REGARDING THE SMALL NUMBER OF HOMELESS OR PREVIOUSLY SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH WHO PETITION FOR AN INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE FORMAL PROCESS. WE HAVE ASSISTED HOMELESS YOUTH AND SUBMITTING REQUESTS FOR CHILD WELFARE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. ALL BASED ON ALLEGATIONS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO THE LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES OR THE AGENCY EITHER NEVER RESPONDED OR ELECTED NOT TO INTERVENE. I PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING TO CASE EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ISSUE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF A SHORTENED INVESTIGAR INVESTIGATORY TIMELINE FOR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. CASE A ALLEGATIONS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE FOOD AND KICKING THE USE OUT OF A FAMILY HOME REPORTED TO THE OCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCY AT LEAST TWO TIMES. THE MINOR SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION TO THE AGENCY WOULD RESPOND TO TEN DAYS LATER THAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE UNFOUNDED AND NO PETITION WOULD BE FILED. THE MINOR THAN REQUESTED A HEARING. SIX WEEKS LATER FOLLOWING TWO DAYS OF TESTIMONY ON THE SAME ALLEGATIONS. THE AGENCY AGREED TO FILE A DEPENDENCY PETITION. THIRTY THREE DAYS LATER THE MINOR WAS DECLARED A DEPENDENT. HE'S TO ALLEGATIONS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT ON THE BASIS OF FAILURE TO PROVIDE BASIC SUPPORT WERE REPORTED TO THE LOCAL CHILD WELFARE AGENCY ON AT LEAST THREE OCCASIONS OVER TWO MONTHS. THE MINOR THEN SUBMITTED AN INVESTIGATION REQUEST TO THE AGENCY AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE. AFTER THREE WEEKS MINOR IN COUNCIL REQUESTED A HEARING AT WHICH THE AGENCY WAS ORDERED TO FILE A DEPENDENCY PETITION WHICH IT DID TWELVE DAYS LATER. FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER THAT THE MINOR WAS DECLARED A DEPENDENT. TO SUMMARIZE THE AGENCY WAS AWARE OF AUSE AND NEGLECT ALLEGATIONS FOR TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE JB. TWO TEN AFTER SUBMISSION OF WHICH IT TOO TEN WEEKS BEFORE THE MINOR BECAME INDEPENDENT. THESE CASES HIGHLIGHT TWO PROBLEMS. FIRST IT CAN TAKE UP TO TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BE ABLE TO FILE UNDER WITH THREE THIRTY ONE EVEN WHERE THERE IS NO DECISION MADE. AND NO INVESTIGATION COMPLETED. SECOND WHERE THE YOUTH MUST ULTIMATELY CHALLENGE THE DECISION IN COURT IT CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL WEEKS OR MONTHS. AS OF RIGHT NOW YOU CAN ONLY REMAIN IN SHELTERS FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. EVEN IF EXTENDED WITH THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED LEGISLATION INCLUDING A B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS AGO. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL WORKING AGAINST THE CLOCK TO COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. THE LONGER YOUNG PERSON REMAINS IN A SHELTER WAITING INVESTIGATION THE MORE STABLE AS THEY BECOME DUE TO INCREASING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. TRANSPORTATION LIMITATIONS THAT INTERFERE WITH SCHOOL ACCESSING EDUCATIONAL ENGAGEMENT SARAH. CURRENT LAW AND REGULATION ALREADY REQUIRED THAT THE IN PERSON INVESTIGATION TAKE PLACE WITHIN TEN DAYS. WHILE SOME MIGHT FIND THE PROPOSED TIME WHEN BURDENSOME IT IS A MINIMAL DIFFERENCE GIVEN THE MOST INTENSIVE PORTION OF THE INVESTIGATION MUST ALREADY BE COMPLETE. SHORTENING AN INVESTIGATION ONLY INCREASES ACCESS TO A CRITICAL SAFETY NET FOR HOMELESS YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR PRIOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. WE OFFER STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. KEEP IT TO THREE MINUTES PLEASE. ADAMS KILLERS ARE VISITING A CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEAR THAN I AM. SOME OF MY MEMBERS OPERATE RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH SHELTERS FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AND THEN THESE MINERS CASES ARE STAFF THAT ARE WORKING WITH THEM ARE MANDATED REPORTERS. AND OFTENTIMES MAKE MULTIPLE CALLS THE HOTLINE IN. AND AT SOME LEVEL WAY AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATION COME OUT OR ANYTHING DO WE JUST CONTINUE TO CALL THE HOTLINE. AND HAVE NOBODY COME OUT BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THIS IS THE ONLY MECHANISM IN CODE THAT REALLY HAS A BACKSTOP. TO BE ABLE TO WIN OUR FOLKS ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THOSE YOU. TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM TO COME INTO YOU CARE AND SO. THE STUDY RESPECT APPRECIATED AND I ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. I'D DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. COME ON UP -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR. I WAS AT FAULT [inaudible] YOU HAVE. EIGHT THE SECOND SORRY IT'LL BE SANCHEZ SEIU CALIFORNIA WE SUBMITTED UNOPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED POSITION TO THIS MEASURE -- IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN REJECTED SO. AT THIS POINT WE UNFORTUNATELY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR STAFF WILLINGNESS TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME CHATTING WITH US ABOUT IT BUT I DID JUST WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH. THE REASONING BEHIND OUR OPPOSITION AND THE REQUEST FOR AMENDMENTS -- FIRST OF ALL THE THE TIME LINE THAT EXISTS UNDER CURRENT LAW OF TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR A RESPONSE. IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE HAVE ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS EVERY SINGLE MONTH TO OUR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES HOTLINE IT'S THE LARGEST CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. AND CITY IN THE COUNTRY WHEN YOU IMPOSE A TIMELINE WHERE BY YOUR PRIORITIZING ONE SMALL POPULATION AND PLEASE NOTE THAT EVERY SINGLE KID. IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CAT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE PRIORITIZING A VERY SMALL POPULATION AND IT'S A POPULATION THE SCOPE OF WHICH WE DON'T KNOW THE ONLY INFORMATION WE'VE. FROM THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU PERCEIVE TODAY TWO ANECDOTES BUT THIS BILL SEEKS TO CHANGE THE LAW FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RIGHT. SO WHEN YOU RE PRIORITIZE A TIMELINE. IN -- CON CONFLICT WITH EVERY SINGLE OTHER STATUTORY REGULATORY OBLIGATION THAT A SOCIAL WORKER HAS THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE REPLACING THE JUDGMENT EDUCATION TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE OF THE SOCIAL WORKER WITH THE STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR WHICH THERE IS NO FUNDING TO ACCOMPANY IT. WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THIS WILL CREATE A SITUATION WHERE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE FOR EXAMPLE GETTING A CALL TO THE HOT LINE SAYING. A HEROIN ADDICTED BABY HAS JUST BEEN BORN AND NEEDS TO BE PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY BUT YOU HAVE THIS TIME LINE WHICH IS SUDDENLY TEN DAYS IN LIEU OF TWENTY ONE DAYS. HOW ARE SOCIAL WORKERS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES? ADDITIONAL SOCIAL WORKER STOP GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS THIS NEW OBLIGATION. SECONDLY THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO POTENTIALLY ARE GOING TO BE KICKED OUT OF HOMELESS SHELTERS BECAUSE OF THE COMING UP AGAINST THE TWENTY ONE DAY TIMELINE. WE A COMPLETELY RECOGNIZED APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO TWENTY ONE DAYS THAT'S WHY WE OFFER GOING DOWN TO NINETEEN DAYS BUT TO SUGGEST. THAT THE BULK OF THE INVESTIGATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE TEN DAY MARKER WHERE IN THAT INVESTIGATION IS OBLIGATED IS NOT ONLY FACTUALLY INACCURATE BUT WRONG IN PRACTICE. A LOT OF THE INVESTIGATION HAS TO TAKE PLACE HOST. VISIT TO THAT FACILITY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE'VE ASKED THAT IT BE WHEN LIMITED TO NO LESS THAN NINETEEN DAYS WERE WERE ACCEPTING OF THE FACT THAT MAYBE A TWO DAY WINDOW WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. BUT ALSO WE WERE ASKING THAT IT BE LIMITED. JUST TO YOUTH LIVING IN HOMELESS SHELTERS OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT THEY GET KICKED OUT THE HOMELESS SHELTERS ON TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS TO INVESTIGATE. THEN IT SHOULD ALSO BE LIMITED JUST TO THE YOUTH THAT ARE LIVING IN THE HOMELESS SHELTERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NUMBERS CAN BE CENTRALLY WHAT THEY CAN YOU OFFER DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TO BE CLEAR WE SENT A LETTER OF CONCERNS A REQUEST FOR AMENDMENTS -- WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL OPPOSE POSITION ON THE LEGISLATION -- BUT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE CONCERNS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF MS SANCHEZ EXPRESSED ON AS YET HIS BEHALF WITHOUT WE COME UP AFTER HER. AND JUST SAY -- THAT WE THINK IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS THIS GROUP IN PARTICULAR OF THE HOMELESS SHELTER YOU'VE HAS COME UP AS THE THE THE SORT OF MOST IMPORTANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS. SO ARE A MOMENT IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THIS QUESTION OF HOW MANY DAYS DO ALSO REQUEST THAT IT BE LIMITED TO THE CHANGE. FOR THOSE PARTICULAR YOUTH WERE IN THE SHELTERS WE DO AGREE THAT A B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WOULD HELP TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF. EVEN AS THE BILLS -- SITS TODAY IN ADDITION TO THE TO THE TEN DAYS THAT WOULD BE GIVEN THAT WE'RE ASKING TO BE A LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME. THE JUDGE WOULD THEN HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY ACT ON SO WE'RE NOT SURE THE BILL REALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE. FOR THE YOUTH HER IN A HOMELESS SHELTERS I MEAN I THINK THE UNDERLYING ISSUE IS TWENTY ONE DAYS IS TOO FAST FOR YOUTH TO BE ABLE TO WHO IS THAT EXPERIENCE ABUSE OR NEGLECT IN OUR CURRENT HOUSING SITUATION. GET INTO THAT NEXT SYSTEM WE WANT TO BE THERE TO HELP THESE YOUTH WE SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE BILL WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE SURE. CAN YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO THE MOVE FORWARD AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS ARE ON THE FINANCIAL ISSUES AND PROP THIRTY ISSUES -- IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. TAKE A BREAK OR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK WE ALSO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE AUTHOR IS DONE ON THIS SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL. BUT WE ALSO -- ARE UNABLE TO SUPPORT WHERE AND TWEENER ON THIS RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. WHAT DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL OKAY -- A SMALL NUMBER TEN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE AN UP ON OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. SURE -- I LIKE TO THINK OF THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO ADD ADDITIONAL BURDENS THE SOCIAL WORKERS. WE HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR BUT RATHER TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ORIGINALLY THIS BILL WAS TO HAVE FIVE DAYS. OF A TURNAROUND TIME WE MADE IT TO TAT -- ADDITIONALLY -- RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. ONE OF THE MAIN SPOKES PEOPLE I'VE SPOKEN TO WAS -- ONE AND A HALF THE KIDS AND ONE OF THE EXPERTS IN LA COUNTY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES BUT AS YOU KNOWTHIS IS GOING TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. I WILL HAVE MORE TIME TO DISCUSS THE FUNDING ISSUE. AT THAT MOMENT -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY AN OPEN TO OPPORTUNITIES OF WHETHER OR NOT. TEN DAYS IS APPROPRIATE OR NINETEEN DAYS BUT AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A DECENT MIDDLE GROUND. BUT ALSO LIKE TO TURN IT TO Y COLLEAGUES RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THAT YOU LIKE TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO THAT. AM I WOULD JUST SAY FROM SOME OF THE HOMELESS SHELTERS WERE HEARING OF MY YOUTH BETTER SEVENTEEN WHEN THE CALLS ARE COMING INTO THE HOT LINE THAT THERE IS NO INVESTIGATION THAT COMES OUT. BECAUSE THE PROCESS ITSELF GETTING THE YOU THROUGH. DEPENDENCY COURT IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME IN THE LATE JOHN TURNED EIGHTEEN BEFORE YOU FINALIZE THE DEPENDENCY PROCEEDING SO. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS ON THEIR SEVENTEEN IT MAKES A REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST THE CLOCK AND SO IF NOBODY'S ACTUALLY COMING OUT IN INVESTIGATING. THANK YOU -- DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CENTER PAN. THANK YOU -- SO IF YOU QUIT FIRST OF ALL JUST TO CLARIFY THAT I THINK WAS A VISITOR NOTHER BILL WE'RE HEARING TODAY TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE TURNING FROM. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BIG AT CELL I MEAN THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PARTICULAR I MEAN CERTAINLY A VERY IMPORTANT SITUATION BUT BUT THIS. YOU KNOW. I MEAN. I UNDERSTOOD THE BILLS NOT JUST ABOUT ANY IT'S IN TERMS OF SOMEONE RUNNING OUT THE I GUESS ABOUT TO TURN. EIGHTEEN RIGHT I MEAN. YOU BROUGHT THAT UP THAT. IS AS WELL AS ANOTHER BILL AB SOME FORTY EIGHT THAT PASS ON CONSENT. LOOK AT AGO YES AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THE DEPENDENCY AND SO THAT'LL NINE TO THIS THAT THE CELL AJANI CLEARED. THE THAT IS WHAT SHOULD NO LONGER BE AN ISSUE PRESUMING THAT THEY'LL GET SIGNED I MEAN THIS BUILDING. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW CAN MISS CERTAINLY NO YOU WILLING TO COME BACK UP. PRODUCTION BEGAN I SHOULD I THE BOARD OF WHERE WHEREVER YOU LIVE YOU AS COMFORTABLE. OKAY WHEN SHE COULD EVER GET SO. SO I MEAN AT EIGHT THIRTY THE THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTER CERTAINLY YOU KNOW MAKE A ARE MAKING THE CASE AND I THINK IT'S THE IMPORTANT ONE THAT OKAY WELL YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S HOMELESS RATE YOU HAVE A CHILD WITH. HOMELESS WHO NEEDS FOSTER CARE. AND THERE MAY BE AN SHELTERED THEY MAY BE OUT IN THE FIELD AND AND AND DAVE PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE SOME PRIORITY RIGHT THEY MEAN DURING A VERY. SICK CAN YOU SPEAK TO FOR EXAMPLE OKAY SO WE HAVE TWENTY ONE DAYS. I'VE MET ON THE FACE OF A NINETEEN DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT'S LIKE GIVING A WHOLE LOT -- DO YOU MAYBE SPEAK TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH IN THAT ANYTHING THE OTHER WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE ANY ANY CHILD TO YOUR LOOK CONSIDERING PUTTING INTO THE FOSTER CARE PROGRAM IS. IN AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE PRECARIOUS SITUATION -- THAT WHEN SOMEONE CALLS. CAN YOU MAYBE SPEAK -- TO RIGHT NOW -- WHAT SOCIAL WORKERS DUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE I MEAN DATE YOU KNOW YOU GOT A HOLD YOU GOT SEVERAL DIFFERENT BECAUSE HE TALKED ELEVEN THOUSAND A MONTH IN LA IN HIM TO EACH COUNTY AND? SO -- SO YOU NOW YOU HAVE SOME YOUTH WHO ARE IN SHELTERS NO LIKE KATE MIGHT CULTURES AND THEY'VE GOT A CALL ON FRIDAY THAT WE HEARD THE COMPLAINT THAT WELL GEE WE CALL NO ONE EVEN COMES OUT GREAT -- SO -- SO HOW I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND HOW YOU CAN GIVE ME CONFIDENCE THAT THE SOCIAL WORKER JUDGMENT IS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PRIORITIZE A SUFFICIENT ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD STATUTORILY SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE THINK THESE ARE. REALLY IMPORTANT KIDS. AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULD DO THIS FIRST. THANK YOU I WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS -- KATHY SINGLING FOR CWD A AGAIN WERE WE HAVE CONCERNS ON THE BILL WE DON'T HAVE IT. IT IS A PROCESS CLARIFY ABSOLUTELY. SO -- THE SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT I I I WANT TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO THAT I THINK -- IF YOU PROBABLY HAVE A COUPLE THINGS GOING ON AS MRS SANTOS NOTED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCESS WHEN THE CALLS COME IN. IS TO TRY TO TALK WITH THE PERSON AND THAT ASCERTAIN WHETHER AN IMMEDIATE OR TEN DAY RESPONSE IS NEEDED OR IF NO RESPONSE IS NEEDED. AND SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS AND THERE'S A DECISION MAKING TOOL THAT WE UTILIZE IN EACH COUNTY ALONG WITH THAT THAT PARTICULAR HOTLINE WORKERS BEST JUDGMENT. TO TRY TO TRIAGE AND PRIORITIZE THOSE CASES IT IS A FACT THAT WERE OPERATING -- IN A SITUATION WHERE WE THINK AND ARE GOING TO BE HAVING SOME CONVERSATION STARTING IN THE FALL WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN HOPEFULLY BRINGING FROM CONVERSATIONS HERE TO THE LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR ABOUT THAT EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM SO I THINK -- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE SOCIAL WORKERS NECESSARY ON THE GROUND TO ARM THEM WITH THOSE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EXCELLENT DECISIONS AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE. IS REALLY CRITICAL AND IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO THE THE YOUTH OR AT PART OF THIS BILL I THINK -- IN THE CONVERSATIONS IT HAS COME UP THAT THE HOMELESS YOUTH ARE THE ONES THAT APPEAR TO BE IN THE MOST NEED OF A QUICKER RESPONSE AND THAT MAKES SENSE TO US THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING. LOOK THE GROUP THAT'S IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY BROAD AND SO -- IT'S YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S HAD A PAST EXPERIENCE ANYONE I THINK THEY'RE SORT OF THREE GROUPS THAT ARE IN THE BILL AND SO GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCESS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH -- GIVEN THE INSTITUTION OF VARIOUS TOOLS AND DECISION MAKING -- THAT IS SUPPOSED TO FEED INTO OUR EFFORTS THAT WERE ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS TIMELY. ON THAT THE TEN DAYS DOES SEEM QUICK TO W. A FULL INVESTIGATION AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS DO YOU RUN THE RISK OF THE WORKER. IN AT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE JUST SAYING UNDER GOING TO SAY NO BECAUSE I CAN'T GET TO YES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BACK THAT UP IF YOU GO TO COURT. YOU HAVE TO FILE A PETITION AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH IN THAT PETITION TO SAY THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE AND I NEED TO BRING THIS YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE. AND IF THEY CAN'T GET TO THAT WITHIN TEN OR EVEN TWENTY ONE DAYS -- I THINK INVESTIGATING A LITTLE BIT TOGETHER WHAT IS WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IF THERE'S NOT A RESPONSE AT ALL. THE LAW IS STRUCTURED TO ME HONESTLY IN A WAY WHERE. THE SOCIAL WORKER HAS TO ACT WITHIN THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS. BUT THERE'S NO REAL PRESUMPTION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T AND SO THE ANECDOTES THAT WE'VE HEARD AND I THINK THE ANECDOTES WERE PRESENTED TODAY I DIDN'T. COMMIT THEM TO MEMORY SEEMED IT SORT OF HAVE THE SORT OF LIMBO WHERE YOU'VE MADE THIS REPORT AND THEN NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AND THEN THE HANDS ARE TIED TO DO ANYTHING AND GO ON TO THE NEXT STEP I MEAN MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AND SAY IF WE'VE. HAD THAT TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THE ANSWER IS LOOK I'M STILL WORKING ON IT I'M TRYING TO GET A FAST AND THERE'S BEEN AN ENGAGEMENT THAT'S ONE THING IF THERE HASN'T BEEN A DECISION MADE. AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET A HOLD OF THAT PERSON WITH A COPY AT THAT WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION SEPARATELY -- MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING TO SORT OF PROCEED TO THE PROCESS WITH THAT THAT. I DON'T KNOW PUT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT ALSO DOESN'T ELEVATE ALL OF THOSE PARTICULAR YOUTH IN THAT GROUP THAT THE BILL CURRENTLY ELEVATES INTO THAT FASTER OR YOU KNOW KIND OF NEXT STEP PROCESS I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME WAYS TO GET OUT THIS. THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL DOES BUT THAT MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE KIND OF THE WORKLOAD IMPLICATIONS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE NUMBERS WE DON'T I CAN'T GET OUT THAT I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW TO GET THAT IN THE DATA. I'M SORRY IT'S KIND OF A LONG WINDED ANSWER BUT LIKE WE'RE TRYING WE SEE THE NEED FOR THESE USED TO BE SAFE WE DON'T WANT THESE USED TO BE IN DANGER. THAT'S I THINK EVERYONE CAN STIPULATE TO THAT THE QUESTION IS WITH IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM AND STRUCTURE HOW DO WE MAKE THAT WORK AND WE JUST DON'T THINK THIS BOOK LIKE IT THAT IT. OKAY. THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW -- BRIDGE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO AND SPONSORS AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. I THINK THE QUESTION IS IS THAT THE RIGHT SOLUTION AND THAT'S READ SOMETIMES LIKE OKAY QUESTION IS IF WE JUST SHORTEN THE DEADLINE IS THAT GOING TO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING. TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHAT A POTENTIALLY GET ATTEND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT IS SOMEONE WHO ALSO YOU KNOW IF IT'S ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES WERE GETTING THE COUNTIES AND SO FORTH. AND MAY WE NEED TO EVISIT SOME OF THAT I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE IF YOU JUST SAY NO NO REALLY DO IT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ENOUGH. TO FIX THE OVERALL ISSUE OR UNDERLYING ISSUES. THANK YOU. THUNDERSTORMS THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW FOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS THAT ARE IN CRISIS AND GOTA CAR LOAN ALLOWS THESE RUNAWAYS AND USED TO STAY IN THESE HOMES FOR TWENTY ONE CONSECUTIVE DAYS AND AND I WANT TO PLUG THE AUTHOR. FOR FOR TRYING TO GET TO THESE -- THESE THESE KIDS IN TROUBLE A LOT SOONER AND I SING IN MY REPORT THAT -- IF A SCIAL WORKER -- DOES NOT FILE A JUVENILE COURT PETITION WITHIN THE TEN DAYS OF THE APPLICATION THE SOCIAL WORKER MUST JUST DOCUMENT FOR ANY REASON NOT FILING. IN NOTIFYING THE APPLICANT OF THE DECISION SO IT DOES GIVE YOU AN OUT IF YOU CAN'T GET TO THE ACCOMPLISH GOALS WITHIN. OF THE TWENTY ONE DAYS BUT YOU KNOW WITH. WE JUST GOT THROUGH TALKING ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND WE WE HAVE KIDS THAT ARE -- IT AT RISK AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SHORTEN THE TIME FRAME MAYBE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DAYS IS TOO LONG AND MAYBE TEN DAYS A LITTLE BIT TOO SHORT. BUT I WANT I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ON THE SIDE OF TEN DAYS AND I WORK WITH LIKE. SOCIAL WORKERS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT JUST DOING YEOMAN'S JOB AND AND SOMETIMES -- YOU KNOW ALL DEPARTMENT SOMETIMES THE A LITTLE INCENTIVE. AFTER SOME LEGISLATION TO GET THINGS TO MOVE FASTER THE GEARS OF GOVERNMENT ON ALWAYS WORK THAT FAST BUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- CHILDREN'S LIVES AND SO YOU KNOW -- I'M. WHEN HEARING THAT MAYBE THE AUTHORS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE MOVE THE BILL FORD I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE? HEALTH THE SAFETY OF OUR OUR YOUNGSTERS TO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS -- VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I LIKED WITH THE BILL. DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I JUST THE I I WOULD. THE I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND AND MY BIG FRUSTRATIONS I THINK WE'RE JUST UNDER. SERVICING THIS IMPORTANT AREA UNDER YOU KNOW FUNDING IT UNDER SOURCING IT -- IT'S HARD TO CREATE HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE THESE KIDS ARE ALL IN NEED AND THEY'RE ALL ENTITLED TO WHATEVER WE CAN DO FOR THEM BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WE RECOGNIZE THAT. AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE ENTITLED TO THE BEST WE CAN GIVE THEM AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE PUTTING MORE INTO THE PROCESS AND NO I THINK WE NEED MORE SOCIAL WORKERS I THINK WE'RE WE NEED TO PAY THEM BETTER. THAN THAT THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN OUR SOCIETY IN IN THE FABRIC OF OF YOU KNOW. TRYING TO TRYING TO HELP THE NEXT GENERATION BE CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATING AND THE WELL ADJUSTED PEOPLE -- IN THE CHALLENGES ARE IN THESE INSTANCES CAN BE ENORMOUS SO. I I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS MADE I APOLOGIZE HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF IN THIS BUT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING AND AND YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP BANGING THIS FROM BECAUSE THESE ARE. VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE THE NOTION THAT WE TRAFFIC THEM -- OR THEY ARE TRAFFICKED AND WE DON'T WE'RE NOT THERE TO HELP -- THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THESE THESE KIND OF OUR NEEDS THAT ANYONE WOULD HAVE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR LIVES -- HISTORY -- SO I I JUST THE THANK YOU AND AND HOPE THAT WE CAN. WE CAN RECOGNIZE HIM PORTENTS OF COMMITTING TO THESE KIDS GOING FORWARD. I THANK YOU I'M SORRY I I THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL AND I I SUPPORT AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- I I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE -- RESOURCE CONCERNS FROM THE COUNTIES AND OFFER MESSY I YOU AND I DON'T DOUBT THOSE RESOURCE. CONSTRAINTS -- AND BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SET THE POLICY. AND THEN YOU WORK TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES FOLLOW AND I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW FOR GONNA. WAIT FOR THE RESOURCES TO ENACT IN FOREIGN POLICY -- A LOT OF TIMES ARE IN WAITING A LONG TIME ONCE WE SET THE POLICY. THE RESOURCES -- CAN FOLLOW AND pTHAT HAPPENS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A REASON NOT TO MOVE FOR A GOOD POLICY TO PROTECT SOME VERY VERY VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE. SOME OF THE NUMBER TEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TIME AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THE GREAT WORK THEY'VE DONE. AGAIN -- I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR SOCIAL WORKERS AND IS NOT MY INTENT TO ADDITIONAL BURDENS TO THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE PROCESS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PRIORITIES. THE CASE WORK IT DOESN'T ADD ADDITIONAL LOADS TO THAT CASE WORK AND SPEAKING TO SOME EXECUTIVES OVER AND DCFS FROM CHILDREN FAMILY SERVICES OR FRIEND LA COUNTY. THEY'VE CAME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS IN TERMS OF RESOURCE WISE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS OF POSSIBILITIES OF ADDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND IN LA COUNTY IN THE VARIOUS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF UNSPENT PROCESS THREE FRONTS MEDICAL SERVICE I DOLLAR FUNDS. AND ACCORDING TO THEM THERE IS A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE USE THOSE HOME WITH USE WHICH HAVE CORPORATISM DISORDERS. BUT THEY HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IN THE OFFICE. SUBSTITUTE -- MEDICAID WITH DRUG AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THAT IS A POSSIBILITY FOR THIS RESOURCE BUT I'M JUMPING AHEAD OF THE GUN. I THINK IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY PASSES COMMITTED WHEN IT GOES ON THAT COMMITTEE I ASSURE YOU AND GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN PROMISE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. OF FINDING A TIME BUT THE TEAM ALSO APPROPRIATE IT IS MY INTENT THAT WITHIN THIS THREE WEEK TIME FRAME AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW. MANY YOU WITH MANY CHILDREN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IT IS MY INTENT THAT WE CAN TRY TO STOP AT THE CURB SOME OF THAT -- FROM HAPPENING SO THAT IS WHY WHEN THIS BILL FOR STARTED WAS FIVE DAYS NOW IT'S AT TEN SO WHAT YOU HAVE MY SOLEMN PROMISE FROM ME AND MY STAFF THAT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY.

NINE AB SEVEN ONE EIGHT AND THERE AFTER WE HAVE [inaudible] AGENDA ITEM. SEVEN EIGHTY SIX ONE TWO SORRY NOT THAT ROOM. NOT. ITEM NUMBER -- SIXTEEN EIGHTY NINE FORTY TWO A SOMEONE A BREAK MY PLEASE FEEL FREE TO START WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YOU VERY MUCH ENDED AT WHILE I'M SITTING HERE BUNCHES AUGUST BODY -- AND LISTENING TO LAST A CONVERSATION I WANT I BET. YOU WOULD ALL BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT THERE'S NO TITLE PROTECTION FOR SOCIAL WORKERS. SO COUNTY'S DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES CPS THEY CAN HIRE ANYBODY LIKE THAT THEY THINK IS QUALIFIED EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN MSW AND CALL THEMSELVES A SOCIAL WORKER. SO THIS IS SOMETHING I HOPE MY FRIENDS IN THE ROOM -- WHO HAVE OPPOSED ME EVERY TIME WE TRY TO DO SOMETHING AROUND TITLE PROTECTION -- JUST MIGHT THINK ABOUT LOVE IT MORE WAS IT WAS A GOOD OPENING I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS GOING OUT AND DOING ASSESSMENTS. I THINK IT'S A GOOD TO HAVE AN ACTUAL MSW OR BSW SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED -- IN SOCIAL WORK AND ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT INTERACT WITH THAT. TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT COULD MAYBE NEXT YEAR. ANYWAY TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT A. B. -- SEVEN EIGHTEEN AND CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW STILL -- PEOPLE CAN NOW STAY IN FOSTER CARE UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE SO THEY CAN GET MRE SERVICES OR WHATEVER THEY MAY NEED -- BUT TRADITIONALLY THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEIR LEGAL DOCUMENTS THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR SOCIAL SECURITY CARD AND TO GO INTO COLLEGE -- AND SOME PEOPLE START AS YOUNG AS SIXTEEN GETTING EMPLOYMENT GOING TO COLLEGE SO THIS WAS THIS SAYS THAT WE REDUCE THE AGE UNDER SIXTEEN WHEN THEY GO FOR THEIR REVIEW. THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE DOCUMENTS -- AND ALSO HAVE -- SOME EDUCATION AROUND HOW DO YOU GET A JOB HOW TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID AND DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE THINK THIS EMPOWERS THE THE YOUNG SIXTEEN YEAR OLD -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME MORE DECISIONS AT THE SAME TIME IS PROVIDING THEM GUIDANCE AS THEY CONTINUE ON IN THE FOSTER CARE AGENCY AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE JULIE MCCORMICK FROM THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHARTER TADO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER EGGMAN FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTY -- TO MY CURRENT ROLE AS A POLICY ASSOCIATE I SPENT ALMOST A DECADE IN THE COURT ROOM PROVIDING DIRECT REPRESENTATION FOR CHILDREN IN CARE. AND WE'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THE NEED FOR THESE YOUTH TO RECEIVE THEIR CENTRAL DOCUMENTS AS THEY BEGIN THEIR TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN WILL BETTER ENABLE OUR TRANSITION AID USED TO PREPARE FOR ADULTHOOD. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE COUNTY WELFARE AGENCIES MUST MAKE CERTAIN IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO A NON MINOR. WHEN THE COURT IS TERMINATING THEIR CASE SUCH AS A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD BIRTH CERTIFICATE HEALTH AND EDUCATION SUMMARY AND THE DRIVER'S LICENSE? UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT LAWS NOW AT ODDS WITH AB TWELVE WHICH EXTENDED FOSTER CARE UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE NOW MANY MANY YOUTH ARE CHOOSING TO STAY IN FOSTER CARE. PAST EIGHTEEN TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BUT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS. UNTIL THEIR CASE CLOSES OFTEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THIS DELAY PRESENTS MANY CHALLENGES TO OUR NON MINOR DEPENDENCE OFTEN TIMES WHEN THEY APPLY FOR JOBS OR FINANCIAL AID OR CERTAIN HOUSING FACILITIES. THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THESE DOCUMENTS YET THEY FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO COME TO COURT TO GET ORDERS JUST TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS. THIS DELAY IS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CLIENTS TO LOSE JB AND OR HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN WOULD FIX THIS ISSUE PROVIDING DOCUMENTS TO OUR CLIENTS WHEN THEY NEED THEM. IT IS A MORE SENSIBLE APPROACH ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF AB. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN ALSO PROVIDES TRANSITION AND YOU WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING AND THE SKILLS ARE CRITICAL AND WILL BETTER PREPARE CLIENTS FOR THEIR TRANSITION. OUT OF FOSTER CARE. AND FINALLY MANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED THIS BILL WILL JUST CHANGE THE TIME FRAME BY WHICH THESE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. AND ASKED THAT THE AGENCY INCLUDED THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED REVIEW HEARINGS REPORT ON THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

WELL I GUESS TO FOSTER YOUTH OR SOMEONE. THAT EIGHTEEN IS IT TWENTY ONE WITH THE THE THE SYSTEM I MEAN WHAT WHEN WHEN DO THEY ACTUALLY. LIKE YOU THEY ARE. CURRENTLY YOU WHEN THEY ARE TURNING JURISDICTION IN THE CASE SO -- FOR A LOT OF YOUTH IT'S TWENTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT AND THEY WOULD GET THEM AT THE REGULAR SCHEDULED HEARING BEFORE THEY TURNED.

ANYTHING FOR MOST DOCUMENTS YOU'RE ABLE TO APPLY IT WENT TO LOSE AND YOU CAN. REAPPLY FOR THEM WHICH IS A SHORTER DOES HELP THE YOUTH WITH A FAKE DO GET LOST SO MOST OF THESE DOCUMENTS EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE AN ORIGINAL.

EIGHTY NINE FORTY TWO THE ACCESS TO SAFE FOOD CHOICE AND FOOD SECURITY ACT -- THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE AND IN DANGER OF EXPERIENCING HUNGER EVERYDAY. PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS DISABLED AND ELDERLY HAVE PARTICULAR. VULNERABILITIES TO HUNGER AND BECOMING FOOD AND SECURE. THE CALIFORNIA FIRST RICH RESTAURANT MEAL PROGRAM THE RMP WAS DESIGNED TO SERVE THESE POPULATIONS RECOGNIZING THE STRUGGLE WITH THE ABILITY TO COOK. AND TO REPAIR THEIR OWN MEALS LACKED THE FACILITIES TO COOK AND STORE FOODS SAFELY I LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES. THE THE RESTAURANT MEAL PROGRAM ALLOWS QUALIFIED PARTICIPANTS TO USE THEIR FOOD BENEFITS TO PURCHASE HOT MEALS. FROM A QUALIFIED PARTICIPATING RESTAURANT DELI COUNTER OR STORE IN A PARTICULAR AND AND PARTICIPATING COUNTIES. CALIFORNIA INTERESTING ENOUGH ONLY HAS TEN COUNTIES ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. AND LAST YEAR OF THE BILL AB EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR WAS CHAPTER TO ALLOW ALL TWENTY THREE C. IS USED TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTY'S PARTICIPATION. WHILE EXPANSION OF COW FRESH RMP OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS OFFERED MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO FOOD OF SAFE FOOD COULD CHOICES TO ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. HUGE GAP FOR MAIN ACCESS AND AND REMAIN. THE OPT IN MODEL HAS FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE REALITIES AND GROWING NEEDS OF PEOPLE'S SITUATION IN THE REMAINING FORTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. AB NINE FOUR THREE WOULD EXPAND THE RESTAURANT MEAL PROGRAM STATEWIDE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER INCREASE FOOD ACCESS FOOD SECURITY FOOD CHOICES FOR HOMELESSNESS -- DISABLED AND ELDERLY RECIPIENTS OF CAL. FOR THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN. ALL OF US ARE NONE THE LORD'S WORK THE FOUNDATION AND THE MOMS RISING IN ADDITION TO THE SUPPORTED BY A MULTITUDE OF FOOD BANKS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS. WITH ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF AB NINE FOUR FOUR TWO IS ESPERANZA FOR NASCO WHO IS A CALIFORNIA SENIOR ORGANIZE A WOOD UNITED FOR RESPECT. AND ALSO FORMER FORMER HOMELESS RECIPIENT OF CAL FRESH LIVING IN A COUNTRY THAT DID NOT OPT IN TO THE RMP. AND JESSICA BARTOLO WHO'S THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. YES OKAY THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS I SPENT ON STUFF ON THICK I I AM I CALIFORNIA SENIOR ORGANIZED EVERYTHING I DID FOR RESPECT. AND ALSO A FOLLOW WITH THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE ECONOMIC JUSTICE TEAM. I'M A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I WAS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AFTER BEING KICKED OUT OF MY HOME AND LET GO FROM MY JOB DUE TO MY GENDER TRANSITION. ADD THIS CAUSED ME TO BE REALLY FOOD INSECURE AND NOT ONLY NO NOT ON THE QUESTION WHERE I WAS GOING TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT. BUT ALSO HOW I WAS GOING TO EAT. WHEN I WENT INTO THE OFFICE TO GET MY EBT CARD AND I'D BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE ASSISTANCE TO EAT? I THOUGHT THAT MY PROBLEMS WERE OVER BUT WHAT I LEARNED IS NOT BECAUSE I WAS HOMELESS IN ONE OF pINTO THE RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM. I COULD NOT USE MY PUBLIC BENEFITS CARD TO PURCHASE ANY FOOD THAT WAS HOT ARE PREPARED. MANY FOLKS THINK THAT THIS IS JUST ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PURCHASE FOOD IN A RESTAURANT BUT IT'S NOT IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO BUY SOMETHING THAT I COULD EAT FROM A GROCERY STORE ARE BEING FORCED TO LOOK AT FOOD OPTIONS. I HAD TO PREPARE WHEN I WAS LEAVING AND MY BOYFRIEND'S CAR AND HAD NO WAY TO STOREMY FOOD AND NOWHERE TO KICK IT. WHAT I LEARNED THROUGHOUT TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME IS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS MASSIVE ACROSS OUR STATE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EASILY FIX WITH THIS LEGISLATION? AMANAT FLY WE URGE YOU TO PLEASE HER EYE ON THIS ASSET THAT WE CAN TAKE A AN OPT IN MODEL THAT GOES COUNTY BY COUNTY. AND MAKE IT A STATE WIDE PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK ABOUT THE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON MOM POVERTY. ONLY JUST TO ADD THAT -- FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A LOCAL. ORGANIZER -- TO END HUNGER IN MY COMMUNITY I ORGANIZED TO TRY TO GET THIS PROGRAM AFTER HAVING MET SENIORS WHO -- TOLD ME THAT THEY WHEN THEY GOT THEIR BENEFITS ON THEIR SNAP CARD THEY HAD TO CHOOSE. WHETHER OR NOT TO SELL THE BENEFITS SO THAT THEY CAN BUY FOOD. BECAUSE THEY LIVED ON THE STREETS IN A COMMUNITY THAT DIDN'T HAVE A GROCERY STORE -- OR GO HUNGRY AND THAT AND THAT THE SENIORS TOLD ME THEY'D RATHER GO HUNGRY -- THIS IS HORRIFYING TO ME THAT WE HAD BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE TO USE AND THEY COULDN'T USE THEM -- AND SO I ORGANIZE LOCALLY THEY SHOULD BE EASY TO FIX. TEN YEARS LATER. THEY SEE MY OWN COMMUNITY WHERE I WAS ORGANIZING STILL DIDN'T HAVE. THE THE THE BENEFIT AND THIS IS THE BENEFITS ARE THERE IS JUST HOW DO YOU USE THEM -- AND AND SO THIS REALLY IS CALLING OUT FOR A STATEWIDESOLUTION -- THIS CAN'T HAPPEN IT DOES HAPPEN IN TEN COUNTIES -- AND WE NEED A LITTLE HELP FROM THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT GO STATEWIDE SO WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL. I NEVER THOUGHT -- I'D SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEEN OR DO SO THANK YOU AND I OR DRIVE A THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY -- WITNESSES AND OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION ALL RIGHT PUSH TO HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS US SENATOR -- CHECK OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOME KIND OF POLICY THAT I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME FIGURE OUT. WHY YOU CAN'T BUY I MEAN YOU'RE HOMELESS? TO HAVE A WARM MEAL. IT COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE I MEAN WAS THERE ANY THINK I'M ASSUMING EVEN IF IT WAS FAULTY THINKING THERE MUST BEEN SOME. SOME EXPLANATION FOR WHY THEY LIMITED TRUE TO WHAT KIND OF FOOD YOU COULD BUT WHAT IS WHO CARES I MEAN WHY IS THAT WHY WAS IT AN ISSUE COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME. WHAT I'M THINKING MAY HAVE BEEN YEAH I MEAN I THINK JUST BRIEFLY AT THE PROGRAM ITSELF WAS? MADE DURING A TIME WHEN PEOPLE REALLY ONLY BOUGHT FOOD STORES IT'S AN OLD PROGRAM THE PROGRAM JUST CELEBRATED FIFTY YEARS. OF ENDING HUNGER -- REDUCING HUNGER IN AMERICA -- SO I THINK THAT -- HOMELESSNESS REMEMBER I I TRY TO TELL YOUNG PEOPLE WE DIDN'T USED TO HAVE HOMELESSNESS LIKE WE HAVE NOW. THIS IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST IN A HOMELESS CRISIS BUT REMEMBER WHEN WHEN THERE WASN'T PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS ALL THE TIME WE ACTUALLY USED TO HAVE THAT IN AMERICA AND WE DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE AND AND THE PROGRAM RULES FEDERALLY. THIS OPTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AVAILABLE BUT BUT PEOPLE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD TO USE IT -- SO I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A COUNTY I UNDERSTAND WHY COUNTY MIGHT. NOT CHOOSE TO YOU KNOW COUNTY COW FRESH OFFICE MIGHT NOT CHOOSE TO ADMINISTER IT IT IS. IT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO KIND OF CREATE ANIMAL YOU WITH A RESTAURANT AND THAT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT A COW FRESH OFFICE USUALLY DOES. AND SO -- YOU KNOW -- WHEN THEY HAVE SOME SO MUCH WORK TO DO JUST TO HELP PEOPLE COMING IN THE DOORS? I I RESPECT THE REASON WHY THEY MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO BUT IT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO IT TO CREATE A SYSTEM AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. FOR THEM TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WORK RIGHT YOU EITHER TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS SO THAT NOT EACH COUNTY HAS TO HAVE A POINT PERSON FOR THE RESTAURANTS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. YES SENATOR I AM. I ALWAYS SAY THERE'S A REASON WHY THE WORD NONSENSE EXIST. HI THAT WAS THE WORD THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT I TRY NOT TO USE IT TO BE NOT ONLY IN DELICATE IF IDEA IF YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND IT AND SO THAT COULD BE WRONG WITH YOU. OKAY. WELL IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND pTO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RATIONALE OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ALL OF OUR FOOD PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH FOOD. AND AND YET WE HAVE SO MANY OBSTACLES THAT PREVENT US FROM DOING IT. AND I HAD NO IDEA THIS ONE NIGHT WHEN I RAN FOR A FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE. I HAD A STUDENT WHO WAS JUST A STUDENT MIGHT WHO WORKED IN MY OWN MY CAMPAIGN. AND SHE STARTED TELLING ME ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF USING HER FOOD STORE HER CAL FOR S. AND SHE HAD TO LEAVE CAMPUS TO GO GET. SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THE CAMPUSES DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH CAL FRESH AN EBT CARDS. AND SO SHE LOSER PARKING IN THIS IS SO THERE WOULD BE SO SHE COULDN'T BUY THE CERTAIN THINGS ON CAMPUS AND SHE COULDN'T. AND YOU HAVE TO LEAVE CAMPUS TO COME BACK AND SOLD SO WE BEGAN TO SAY WELL LET'S PUT EBT CARDS ON CAMPUS WELL OF COURSE UNIVERSITY TOLD US IT WOULD COST US. WHAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER CAMPUS TO BUY LITTLE MACHINE? AND WE ALL BOUGHT INTO IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR UNTIL A ONE OF THE CAMPUS CAME AND SAID WE DID THAT. AND IF SO HOW MUCH IT COSTS IS ALL ABOUT. TO A FIFTY DOLLARS I MEAN. IT. AND THEREFORE WE GOT EBT CARDS ON EVERY CAMPUS BECAUSE OUR OUR ANIMALS TOLLS WAS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY TOLD US IT WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. AND SO WE WHEN EVERYBODY REALIZED HOW SIMPLE IT WAS WE JUST DID IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ADDING WHETHER ADDING ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE THE LITTLE MACHINE IN AND OUT. I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT BUT THAT HAS BEEN WE HAVE BEGUN AS WE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH WITH THE THE GROUPS HERE. TO REALLY DISCOVER ALL THE SMALL THINGS THAT REALLY PREVENT US FROM THE PROVIDING SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS FOOD TO PEOPLE AND THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN A FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT IS SO IT DOESN'T COST US TO DO THIS PROGRAM. AND YET WE DON'T DO IT IN AND OUT OF FIFTY SOME ACCOUNTS WE HAVE. TEN AND AND WE AND WE HAD CAMPUSES THAT DID MORE IN COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE IT SO WE THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO MAKE IT HAVE AGREEMENT WITH A C. ISSUES THAT THEY WOULD USE IT ON THEIR CAMPUSES. AND SO IT IS IT'S IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU LOOK AT AND THINK. WHAT IT IS REALLY SIMPLE YOU KNOW AND YET ONLY TEN COUNTIES ARE PARTICIPATING -- SO YOU KNOW WE JUST TRY TO PUSH THIS I THANK YOU. BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE THIS ONE OUT I CAN IMAGINE THE RATIONALE I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HELP DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY WELL UP. FROM EVERYONE LASTLY I WON'T.

ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO REDUCE CHILD HUNGER THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS PROGRAM HAS HELPED CHILDREN GAIN ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD AND IS AIMED TO REDUCE FOOD AND SECURITIES. AND PROMOTE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT WHICH AS WE KNOW ESPECIALLY FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IS VERY CRITICAL TO THEIR LEARNING. HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FOOD IN SECURE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING FREE OR REDUCED MEALS BUT THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING BENEFITS THROUGH CAL FRESH. AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WILL DIRECT STATE DEPARTMENTS LOCAL HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO EXAMINE DATA AN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT BENEFITS PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO FIND THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION AND DEVELOP A STATEWIDE PROCESS THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE XCELERATED ENROLLMENT OF CHILDREN INTO CAL FRESH. THE BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. AND I WILL LET MY WITNESSES -- SELF INTRODUCE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YET AGAIN FOR ANOTHER I VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY CENTERED WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION PLEASE A CO SPONSOR OF LEGISLATION. THE THE ISSUE AS WE KNOW IS THAT CHILDREN IN POVERTY CHILDREN HER HUNGRY AND THE TOXIC STRESS THAT THAT BRINGS MAKE THEM UNABLE TO LEARN EFFECTIVELY ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS. IT SETS THEM BACK AND THERE HAVE BEEN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS OVER THE TWENTY YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THIS JOB ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE NOT INVOLVED. WE FEEL LIKE THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE AN AVENUE FOR THAT WE FEEL LIKE PERHAPS USING MEDICAL DATA WOULD HAVE AN AVENUE FOR THAT BUT THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE THREE PROGRAMS. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DATA SYSTEMS AND SO WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TRY TO MATCH ALL OF THAT UP TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS OUR UNIVERSE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND HOW DO WE GET AT THAT UNIVERSE TO REDUCE AND BRING AS MANY OF THE CHILDREN. AND THEIR FAMILIES INTO THE PROGRAM AS WELL THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES RIGHT NOW OF COURSE WITH IMMIGRANTS AND IMMIGRATION THERE -- EFFORTS WE DON'T WANT TO PRESUME THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT LEGISLATION THAT WE THOUGHT SPONSORED OURSELVES IN SOME CASES JUST HAVEN'T GOT IT DONE. WE FEEL LIKE BRINGING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE AND HAVING THE LEGISLATURE STAY THIS IS IMPORTANT FORMALLY WE WANT YOU AT THIS TABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT WILL HELP US CRACK THAT NOT THAT'S WHAT THE IDEA. DYLAN WE ARE DRIVER. THANK YOU YOUR SON OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS -- AS YOU HEARD WE KNOW THAT HOW FRESH IS A REALLY CRITICAL SAFETY NET AND WE SEE THAT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT DO HAVE ACCESS TO CAL FOR ASH. THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE LOWERED THEY HAVE HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF I'M GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY LOWER THEIR RISK OF HEART DISEASE AMONG MANY OTHER FACTORS -- THAT IMPROVE THEIR LIVES AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE ENROLLMENT RATING HOW FRESH IS TOO LOW AND THAT MANY MANY HOUSEHOLD INCLUDING CHILDREN WHO ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE NOT. AND ARE NOT GETTING THE ACCESS THAT THEY DESERVE TO THE PROGRAM. I'M. LIKE YOU HEARD MANY COUNTIES HAVE TRIED -- TO FIGURE OUT A GOOD CONNECTION BETWEEN SCHOOL MEALS AND CAL FOR US AND IT'S BEEN. INCREDIBLY CUMBERSOME AND REALLY COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. I AM SO WE A ALONG WITH -- THE DEBT THE DEPARTMENTS AND MANY OTHER ADVOCATES ARE REALLY% LOOKING FORWARD TO A FORMAL PROCESS TO TRYIN. I'M FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS WELL IN A WAY THAT MAKES ACCESS TO CAL FRESH AND DIGNIFIED INEFFICIENT AND ALSO CREATES A STREAMLINED AND REALLY SIMPLE PROCESS FOR BOTH COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SO. ON THIS ON THIS BILL. DOES HAVE A BI PARTISAN SUPPORT AND AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE ANY WITNESSES THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. LIKE HE DOES HE'LL BE HAVE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND SUPPORT. DOES PARCLO WESTERNS AND OUR LAN PARTY IN SPORT.

NEEDED FOR SUPPORT. TO HELP IN THESE PLACEMENTS -- THIS BILL STREET IN THE CITY PROCESS BY CREATED NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. ENGAGE NEUTRAL FACILITATE FACILITATORS. ENSURES EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS HOLDER IS INCLUDED DECISION. I'M DELIGHTED TO HAVE SUPPORT TODAY FROM. CURRENT MAKE SURE I GET THIS RIGHT -- STEVE ASHMAN WITH THE SENSOR COUNTY CASA PROGRAM. AND I'M GONNA TURN TO STEVEN MY OTHER WITNESSES BECAUSE FOR THE BILL. GREAT THANK YOU I'LL BE EXTREMELY BRIEF GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SEAN C. AS YOU AND I WORK WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND WE ARE VERY HONORED TO BE CO SPONSORS OF A V.. TEN SIXTY EIGHT JOHN FAMILY TEAMS ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM THEY GIVE THE YOUTH CARE GIVERS AND FAMILIES A VOICE IN THE DECISION MAKING AND SERVICE PLANNING THAT IMPACTS OUR LIVES. HOWEVER THAT ONLY WORKS WHEN FAMILIES HAVE ADVANCE NOTICE OF TEAM MEETINGS WHEN THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSIONS. I WENT ITEMS AGREED TO BY THE TEAM OR FOLLOW UP ON AND ACTED UPON SO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. AND STEVE AUSTIN IS HERE TO SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE PROVISIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I STRONGLY URGE RIVAL. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME'S STEVE ASHTON I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES PROGRAM IN STANISLAUS COUNTY -- BUT IS ALSO BEEN MY PRIVILEGE OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS TO BE AN ADVOCATE -- FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR COUNTY. IN THAT ELEVEN YEARS -- I HAVE HELD EDUCATION RIGHTS FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DIFFERENT CHILDREN. CURRENTLY I HOLD EDUCATION RIGHTS FOR THIRTY SIX DIFFERENT CHILDREN AND YOUTH -- I A I'M SOMETIMES INCLUDED IN CHILD FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS BUT OFTEN WHEN I AM I'M NOTICED -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE HOUR AND TWO DAYS AHEAD OF TIME -- NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TIME TO PREPARE AND OR EVEN SHOW UP TO A MEETING THAT IS OFTEN VERY VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ALL OF THE KIDS THAT I ADVOCATE FOR AND HOLD AT RICE FOR HOUSE SOME SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL OR MENTAL HEALTH OR CUT SOME COMBINATION OF NEED. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DISCUSS THEIR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PROBABLE ONES WHEN THEY'RE MOVED. RECENTLY IN FEBRUARY I HAD A YOUNG MAN WHO'S FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WHO IS FOUR MONTHS AWAY FROM GRADUATING FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL AND MOVING ON TO HIGH SCHOOL. HE WAS ATTENDING A NON PUBLIC SCHOOL IN OUR COUNTY -- AND CHILD WELFARE DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO MOVE HIM AND IN THEIR INFINITE WISDOM THEY MOVED HIM ABOUT EIGHTY MILES AWAY FROM HIS CURRENT SCHOOL. THEY MOVED HIM TO A COUNTY WHERE THERE WERE NO SERVICES WHATSOEVER TO MEET IS EDUCATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH OR OTHER NEEDS. HAD THEY INCLUDED ME IN THE MEETINGS THAT THEY WERE HOLDING TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION FOR THIS YOUNG MAN. THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE SERVICES -- IN THE COUNTY THEY WERE MOVING HIM TO WERE BASICALLY NONEXISTENT. AS A RESULT -- BECAUSE I HELD HIS HEAD RIGHTS AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP HIM IN A SCHOOL OF ORIGIN THANKS TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATION -- WE WORKED OUT A WAY TO KEEP HIM IN A SCHOOL UNTIL THE END OF THE SEMESTER -- HOWEVER ALL A LOT OF ISSUES COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED NOT NOT. THE LEAST OF WHICH WERE SOME OF THE STRESSORS THAT WERE PLACED UPON THIS YOUNG MAN KNOWING THAT HE WAS MOVING AND THE FEAR THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE LEAVING A SCHOOL THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS -- AB ONE TEN SIXTY EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT RIGHTS HOLDERS ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE. IT ALSO WOULD ASSURE INSURES THAT THERE IS SUCH A PROPER NOTICE GIVEN TO US SO THAT WE CAN MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN ANY AND ALL MEETINGS. WHICH IS A NECESSITY. AND LASTLY -- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE COURT. OUR JUDGE IN OUR COUNTY WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER CASES AND ALSO WANTS TO KNOW VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF EDUCATION. I THINK THAT. NOTICE OF A CFT MEETING AND WHAT HAPPENS IN WHO ATTENDS THOSE MEETINGS IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE IN THOSE COURT REPORTS SO I RESPECTIVE RESPECTIVELY REQUEST YOUR I VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU STEVE. THANK YOU HOW DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD EVENING DANIEL MALL A CALIFORNIA LIGHTS OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND SUPPORT.
