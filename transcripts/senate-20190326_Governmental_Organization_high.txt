DODD. YOUR DIED HERE WILK PRESIDENT WILL CARE ALLEN. ARCHULETA. ARCH LETTER HERE PORGES. OR JUST HERE BRADFORD. CHANGE. GALGIANI GLAZER. GLAZER HERE HILL. HILL HERE WEST SO JONES. JONES HERE NIELSEN [inaudible] TINO. PORTANTINO HERE RUBIO. RUBIO AS A RUBIO HERE WIENER. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM OF FIRST ORDER BUSINESS MORNING'S ITEM NUMBER TWO SB TWO SIXTY FOUR BY CENTER GLAZER [inaudible] GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES IN OUR WORLD AND CERTAINLY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT ONE ON THIS BILL SO I WILL WALK YOU THROUGH -- THE PURPOSE OF IT BUT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW A TYPE TWO WINE GROWERS LICENSEE. TO HAVE UP TO TWO OFFSITE TASTING ROOMS. UNDER EXISTING LAW TYPE TWO WINERIES ARE ALLOWED UP TO TWO TASTING ROOMS TOTAL ONE ON SITE AT THEIR PRODUCTION FACILITY. AND A SECOND OFF SITE. I HAVE A OVER -- FIFTY FIVE ONE REASON MY DISTRICTS HAVE BETWEEN THE LIVERMORE VALLEY IN EAST CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND A YEAR OR SO AGO WHEN TORY MY DISTRICTS AGRICULTURE ON WINE REGION IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT AN ISSUE ARISES FOR SOME WINERIES. WHEN THEY OPERATE UNTRUE AND UNDER AN ALTAR ALTERNATING PROPRIETORSHIP? AN AGREEMENT WHERE WINERY IT WILL PRODUCE THEIR WINE AT ANOTHER WINERIES PRODUCTION FACILITY. WHEN A WINERY ENTERS INTO THIS AGREEMENT? THERE ARE MASTER TYPE TO WINE GROWERS LICENSE AND THE ACCOMPANYING RIGHT TO AN ON SITE TASTING ROOM IS USED TO COVER THE BORROWED FACILITY. WITH SOME RARE EXCEPTIONS THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE THAT WINERIES OPERATING UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN AND USE IT TO DUPLICATE TYPE TO WINE GROWERS LICENSE FOR THEIR INITIAL TASTING ROOM. AND AS A RESULT ARE UNABLE TO HAVE TO STE TASTING ROOMS LIKE MOST OTHER TYPE TWO WINERIES. TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ALL TIED TO WINE GROWERS TO HAVE TWO TASTING ROOMS WHILE MAINTAINING THE EXISTING PRIVILEGES FOR WINERIES WHEN VESTED THEIR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT. IMPORTANTLY ANY ADDITIONAL OFFSITE TASTING ROOM THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS BILL WOULD NEED TO MEET EXISTING LOCALZONING REQUIREMENTS. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURES TIM SCHMELZER WITH THE WINE INSTITUTE. pWINE INSTITUTE -- HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION -- TASTING ROOMS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALLER WINERIES TO CONNECT WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS -- THE EXPANSION OF THIS PRIVILEGE TO ALLOW FOR ANOTHER ROOM -- WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THEIR OPPORTUNITY BUSINESS AND CONNECT WITH CALIFORNIANS. KIRCHER SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE'S SUPPORT ANY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE TURN BACK -- TO COMMITTEE [inaudible] YES [inaudible] THIS. THANK YOU JUST A QUICK QUESTION. WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE OR DO YOU ARE YOU AWARE OF THE RATIONALE THAT LIMITED TO ONE IN NOT? THREE FOUR WELL IT IT THEIR EXISTING LAW ALLOWED YOU TO HAVE TO BUT A MONTH WHAT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE TO WHICH ONE COULD BE WHERE YOU'RE WE PRODUCE THE WINE. AND THE SECOND WHERE YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR TASTING ROOM SAY AND MARK -- CONVENIENT LOCATION FOR VISITORS -- BECAUSE WINERIES DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT THAT THE CAPITAL TO HAVE ALL THEIR PRODUCTION IN HOUSE. THAT THEY THEY CONTRACTED OUT FOR THAT PRODUCTION ADD ANOTHER WINERY SPACE SO THEY COULDN'T HAVE THAT THEY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING LAW TO HAVE A TASTE ROOM AT SOMEONE ELSE'S SPACE. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN ALLOWED. TO BUT THEY WERE THEY DEFINE ONE OF THEM TO BE WHERE YOU PRODUCED AND IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU'RE SMALL YOU DON'T NESTLE HAVE ALL THE EQUIPMENT TO PRODUCE AN AT AND HOUSE. ALLOWING YOU TO HAVE TO LIKE OTHER WINERIES SO THIS WOULD GIVE THEM THAT EXTRA PRIVILEGE OUT BECAUSE OUR SMALL. I'D OF A SPORT THANK YOU IF WE A MOTION BY SENATOR HILL -- TO TO PASS -- THIS THIS BILL -- WE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE FILE ITEM TO SB TWO SIX FOUR MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE DODD. HI. DODD HI WELCOME HI WILK AYE ALLEN. ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA I'D FORGES OR BORDERS AYE BRADFORD. BRADFORD I CHANGE. CHIANG AYE GALGIANI AYE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE HILL. HILL AYE HUESO. JONES.

ELEVEN WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR THAT -- HAS ELEVEN ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT WONDERFUL CLOTHES THAT I'D NEVER ALLOWED YOU TO GIVE -- WITH THAT -- WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THANK SENATOR. WE'RE GONNA DO -- GOING -- TO COUPLE BILLS I'M RUNNING SO -- ITEM NUMBER THREE WILL BE FIRST SB TWO NINETY HI. I KNOW YOU REMOVED REMEMBER THAT FOREVER MISTER CHAIR YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CLIMATE CHANGE IS CREATING ENORMOUS FINANCIAL RISK AND CHALLENGES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL FIRES BROKE OUT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BURNING EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND ACRES DESTROYING HOMES AND TRAGICALLY KILLING. A HUNDRED FOR PEOPLE. WHILE FAR DESTRUCTION RESULTING INSURED LOSSES OF OVER TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA'S SPENT OVER NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON WILD FIRE SUPPRESSION IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN EXCEEDING ARE EXPECTED BUDGET. BY OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION THE SUPPRESSION IN RESPONSE COST. THE STATE IS SPENDING BILLIONS MORE ON RECOVERY. THIS FINANCIAL STRESS LEADS THE BUDGET INSTABILITY. THIS INSTABILITY IS BECOME TYPICAL RATHER THAN OCCASIONAL. OUR STATE BUDGET IS BEING IMPACTED FOR YEARS TO COME. UNEXPECTED DISASTERS CREATE EXTREME BUDGET UNCERTAINTY TAKING AWAY RESOURCES FROM OTHER VITAL SERVICES AND REDUCING OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT AGAINST OR PREVENT FUTURE DISASTERS. TO CORRECT THAT. SB TWO NINETY IS A PLAN THAT BRINGS GREATER PREDICTABILITY TO OUR STATE COFFERS IN TIMES OF DISASTER. IT ALLOWS US. TO FIND MORE STATE SERVICES OR MAKE GREATER INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA'S ACTOR DISASTER INSURANCE ACT SB TWO NINETY THE THE GOVERNOR WORKING WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE TREASURER IS AUTHORIZED TO NEGOTIATE ENTER INTO. AN INSURANCE POLICY THAT PAYS OUT WHEN WE HAVE UNEXPECTED DISASTER EXPENSES. SIMPLY PUT. THIS IS INSURANCE ON A SPECIFIC PORTION OF OUR STATE BUDGET THAT LETS US HARNESS INSURANCE MARKETS TO STABILIZE THE STATE WILDFIRE BUDGETS. IN FREE UP RESOURCES FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO EMBARK ON SUCH A RIG -- COURSE OF REDUCTION RISK REDUCTION THROUGH INSURANCE THE STATE OF OREGON HAS BEEN USING INSURANCE ON WILDFIRE FUNDS FOR THE PAST FORTY YEARS. THE STATE WOULD ONLY SECURE INSURANCE. ON TERMS THAT BENEFIT TAXPAYERS LET ME REPEAT THAT THE STATE WOULD ONLY SECURE INSURANCE ON TERMS THAT WOULD BENEFIT% TAXPAYERS. SB TWO NINETY IS SUPPORTED BY OUR TREASURE WHO'S HERE WITH ME TODAY THE AUDIBLE FIELD AMAT. AS WELL AS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE RBEL RICARDO LARA REPRESENTED TODAY BY DEPUTY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MICHAEL MARTINEZ. THANK YOU A SENATOR DODD AND INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND TO MEMBERS IT'S NICE TO BE. UP BACK -- INVOLVED THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS -- I THINK WE ALL HAVE SEEN THAT -- FIRES AND FLOODS -- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WITH IF BUT WHEN AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE INSTEAD OF REACTIVE. IN THIS AREA SO YOU THE THREE MAIN TAKEAWAYS OUT FOR THIS BILL THIS BILL IS PERMISSIVE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE TO ANYTHING JUST ESTABLISHES THE REQUIREMENT THAT IT MAY DO SOMETHING UNDER THE RIGHT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. NUMBER TWO THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO WILDFIRE SHOULD BE SEEN AS A CONTINUUM NOT AS A SINGLE LEGISLATIVE ACT. RESPONSES ARE INTENTIONAL INTERCONNECTED AND BECOME PART OF A LARGER WHOLE PROBABLY THE LARGER HOLE THAT THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE IS. UNDOUBTABLY CONTEMPLATING AND THREE THE STATE'S CURRENT FINANCIAL SURPLUSES ARE NOT A FUTURE GIVEN RATHER ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY IS OFFERED BY SB. TWO NINETY IS WHEN ABLE FUTURE FINANCIAL BURDENS TO BE INSURED IN THE FUTURE. IF IT IS IN THE STATE'S BEST INTEREST TO DO SO AND BY DOING SO THE STATE'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RECEPTION. IN THE DEBT MARKETS IS PROTECTED IN TIMES OF FISCAL STRESS. IN AS SENATOR DODD MENTIONED -- YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST STATE TO DO THIS -- ORGAN HAS HAD A LONG STANDING WILDFIRE POLICY -- AND THEY BY COVERAGE THAT LAST FORTY YEARS. OF THE WORLD BANK HAS A CATASTROPHE BOND TO HELP WITH EARTHQUAKES AROUND THE WORLD. AND THEN FEMA ALSO HAS INSURANCE THAT PROTECTS US STATES AGAINST FLOOD INSURANCE SO. ON THIS IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT JUST LIKE WE BUY HEALTH INSURANCEAND HOME INSURANCE AND CAR INSURANCE AT THE SAME CONCEPT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HI GOOD MORNING MICHAEL MARTINEZ SENIOR DEPUTY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HERE. ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RECORD A LOT OF SENSES REGRETS NOT BEING ABLE TO BE HERE HE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF THE STATE. AND I HAVE HERE WITH ME MIKE PETERSON WHO SERVES AS THE COMMISSIONERS NEW INAUGURAL DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR CLIMB AND SUSTAINABILITY TO HELP PROVIDE US SOME REMARKS MUTUALLY AFTER ME. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU REMEMBER IT THEN CENTER LOT I WHEN HE WAS HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE YOU MIGHT REMEMBER HIS STRONG PASSION. FOR COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN HE WAS HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND SO HE STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS CURRENT CONTRIBUTING TO MORE SEVERE WILD FIRES AND VOLATILE COSTS FOR THE STATE. WE SEE THIS INSURANCE MARKETS WITH LOSSES TOTALING OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THAT THESE CONTINUAL CLIMATE RESTORED REALLY CHALLENGING US TO RETHINK. HOW WE PROTECT OUR STATE BUDGET FROM ALL FIRE SHOCKS INCLUDING HOW TO HARNESS PRUDENT INSURANCE PRODUCTS USED ALREADY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD? THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE OUR BUDGETS PREDICTABILITY AND EMPOWER THE STATE TO INVEST IN GREATER RISK REDUCTION EFFORTS WITHOUT NEEDING TO DROP ON THE STATE'S. BUDGET RESERVES AND AS THE THE THE TREASURED STATED THAT THIS IS A AGAIN PERMISSIVE IT ALLOWS US WITH THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THE FROM THE GOVERNOR. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND STATE TREASURER TO EXPLORE THIS OPTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S AN BENEFIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN ONE THING. TO OF CHAIR DOT FOR HS AUTHORSHIP OF THIS MEASURE AND AND FOR COOPER -- CO SPONSORSHIP IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TREASURE MIKE. THE MORNING OF MY PEERS AND AND DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE -- SO I JUST WANTED A COUPLE NOTES ON THE FEMALE EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY FEMA'S NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM HAS HELD RESERVES TO RESPOND TO LARGE SCALE STORMS. IN COULD YEARS USERS OR STAY PUT AND THEY LOOK LIKE A STRONG POLICY BUT THEN THERE ARE CHALLENGING YEARS SO IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN HURRICANE KATRINA HIT. ON THE COSTA SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN SUPERSTORM SANDY HIT THE NORTHEAST THE COST WITH EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THIS CAUSED VEHEMENTLY CONSIDER OTHER STRATEGIES BETTER POSITION AGENCY TO RESPOND TO FLOODS WITHOUT OVER ANY RESERVES. SEVEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FEMA BEGIN SECURING REINSURANCE ON THEIR FLOOD RESPONSE FUNDS. THE POLICY WAS SET UP THIS WAY THE POLICY WOULD TRIGGER IF TOTAL LOSSES REACHED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN WHICH CASE FEMA RECEIVES UP TO BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL COVERAGE. ONE YEAR LATER HURRICANE HARVEY TRIGGERED THE POLICY AND THE FOR INSURANCE PROGRAM RECEIVE THE FULL COVERAGE -- SO WITH THAT SO AN EXAMPLE ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THE TREASURE. TALKED ABOUT THE EXAMPLE ORGAN ON THE STATE LEVEL WITH A FEW OTHER EXAMPLES TO THE WORLD BANK FOR WHAT ALL THESE EXAMPLES HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY ARE A MECHANISM TO DIVERSIFY RISK. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE DISASTROUS YOU CAN EITHER SELF INSURE YOU CAN RELY ON PREVENTION OR YOU CAN TRANSFER SOME OF THIS RISK AND THE BASIC ARGUMENT FOR INSURANCE IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE HIGHLY VARIABLE COST YOU CAN SOME OF THE BUDGET. BY STRATEGICALLY TRANSFERRING RISK WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE GOVERNOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND TREASURE TO EXAMINE HAS A POLICY TO BETTER POSITION CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK FOR YOU AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE HONESTY. TO NINETY SECURE MEMBER SHANE LEVINE ON BEHALF OF THE RE INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TWO NINETY SB TWO NINETY WILL ALLOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITY TO CONVERT UNKNOWN NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE COSTS INTO A MANAGEABLE BUDGET ITEM. THAT ENSURES THE CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE NATURAL DISASTER EMERGENCY SERVICES AND MAINTAIN ITS OTHER BUDGET PRIORITIES. SIMPLY PUT REINSURANCE IS INSURANCE THAT IS SOLD TO AN INSURER OR A STATE ENTITY TO TRANSFER RISK TO LIMIT THE PROBABILITY OF A LARGER THAN EXPECTED LOSS OR COSTS. FROM IN THIS CASE A COVERED NATURAL DISASTER. THIS IS A FISCALLY PRUDENT WAY FOR THE STATE TO MANAGE ITS DISASTER RIGHT RISK LIKE THE WAY FOR HIM IN THE STATE OF OREGON CURRENTLY DO. COMPARED BORROWING OR BONDING INSURANCE TRANSFERS A FINANCIAL RISK OF AN ON CERTAIN AMOUNT FOR A CERTAIN PREMIUM PAYMENT INSURANCE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO BORROW NEW MONEY. IN KERR INTEREST OR REPAY ANY PRINCIPLE. DESPITE LARGE LOSSES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN REINSURANCE PRICES AND OTHER TERMS CONTINUE TO BE FAVORABLE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE CAPITAL EXCEEDS THE DEMAND FOR REINSURANCE. BRIEFLY PRICE RISK THEY'RE STILL INCREDIBLY ROBUST REINSURANCE MARKET WAS REINSURER CAPITAL SITTING AT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY AND READY TO BE DEPLOYED. WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE PROBABILITY OF FUTURE DISASTERS AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THIS TOOL AT ITS DISPOSAL WITH THAT WE HAVE TROUBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE ANY OTHERS WANT TO ADD ON GERMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WHEN I'LL BE OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE WHOLESALERS ASSOCIATION.

THIRTEEN HOLD IT OPEN. CONGRATULATIONS MISTER CHAIR PAST THIRTEEN OH IS IN NOW MOVE ON TO RULES COMMITTEE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE SB. TWO OH NINE HEY MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AS B. TWO OH NINE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE WARNING CENTER A JOINT VENTURE OF THE CPUC. CAL -- WE US IN CALIFORNIA TO CONDUCT FIRE WEATHER FORECASTING THAT ALLOWS FOR ACCURATE LOCALIZED WILD FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT. AND THREAT WARNING. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WILD CARD CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP BETTER WHILE FAR FORECASTING AND WILD FOR FIRE THREAT ASSESSMENT CAPABILITIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR DEFICIENCIES WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF FIRE WEATHER MONITORING AND FIRE THREAT RISK ASSESSMENT IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LACK OF CRITICAL WEATHER DATA ESPECIALLY LOCALIZED WIND DATA. THERE'S A LACK OF STATE LEVEL COORDINATION IN THE DEPLOYMENT A WEATHER STATIONS BY UTILITIES. THERE'S A LACK OF AGGREGATION OF WEATHER STATION NETWORK DATA. THERE'S A LACK OF STATEWIDE FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL. OF SKEWS ME FIRE PART -- THREAT THE POTENTIAL FOR CASTING WHICH LEADS TO IN EFFECTIVE USE OF STATE RESOURCES. AND THERE'S A DECENTRALIZED -- FIRE WEATHER MONITORING WHICH SLOWS STATE WILDFIRE RESPONSE. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED SB NINE OH ONE THAT REQUIRED THE CPC AND CAL FIRE TO ENTER. INTO AN M. O. U. TO COOPERATIVELY DEVELOP CONSISTENT APPROACHES AND SHARE DATA RELATED TO FIRE PREVENTION SAFETY. IT BUT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN ENERGY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ENSURE RESULTS FROM VARIOUS FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WILDFIRE PREDICTION DEFICIENCIES I JUST MENTIONED SB TWO OR NINE TAKES THAT COOPERATION REQUIRED IN SB NINE A ONE ONE STEP FURTHER. AND BRINGS CAL FIRE DIRECTLY INTO THE MIX. UNDER SB TWO OH NINE THE C. W. W. C. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING MONITORING OF FIRE WEATHER. FIRE WEATHER IN THREAT CONDITIONS AS WELL AS ON GOING IMPROVEMENT OF FIRE WEATHER FORECASTING MODELS. THE C. W. W. C. WILL RECEIVE COURT DATE AND VERIFY INFORMATION PERTAINING TO WILDFIRE THREAT CONDITIONS. UTILITY PROACTIVE DEANNA. P. URGES ATION OF POWER LINES IN FIERY VETS THE C. W. W. C. WILL OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF AUTOMATED WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATIONS DESIGNED. TO OBSERVE SMALL SCALE METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA THAT CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASE WILDFIRE RISK INCLUDING A STATE WHAT STATE WIDE FIRE WEATHER FORECASTING MONITORING AND THREAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. THE C. W. W. C. WILL WORK WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO ADOPT C. W. W. C. APPROVED WHETHER MONITORING EQUIPMENT. AND THE C. W. W. C. WILL OVERSEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VALIDATED FIRE THREAT POTENTIAL INDEX IT ENSURE THAT EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN CALIFORNIA IS COVERED BY A FIRE THREAT. POTENTIAL INDEX I'M AWARE THAT SOME VERY GOOD WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE IN THE AREA FIRE THREAT WEATHER PREDICTION INCLUDING THE WORK OF ES DE JEANNIE. AT OUR OWN CAL FIRE. IT'S MY INTENTION THAT IN OFFERING SB TWO OH NINE IS TO BRING THE DESPERATE FIRE THREAT PREDICTION ACTIVITIES TOGETHER TO COORDINATE AND STANDARDIZE RESPONSE PROTOCOLS. TO THOSE THREATS BY OUR ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND LOWER THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S JOHN KENNEDY I'M WAS RC RC RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA -- WE SUPPORT AS THE TWO OH NINE AS WAY TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE WILD FIRE WARNING CENTER RC RC MEMBER COUNTIES CONTAIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S FORCE PLANS. AND WE BORN THE BRUNT OF A LOT OF THE RECENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AS SUCH. AND GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND DESTRUCTIVENESS OF THOSE FIRES WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK AN INCREASE -- WILD FIRE RESPONSE. WE BELIEVE THIS ENHANCED WEATHER MONITORING SYSTEM WILL HAVE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS INCLUDING AS WAS SAID THE PREDICTION OF WILDFIRE RISKS IMPROVING THE STATE AND LOCAL ABILITY TO CALL OUT PRE POSITION ASSETS TO QUICKLY RESPOND IN THE EVENT TO WILD FIRE BREAKS OUT. AND ENABLING UTILITIES TO BE A LITTLE MORE NIMBLE AND THEY'RE DE ENERGIES ATION EVENTS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND ARE INTENDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK. HOWEVER IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES HAD THEIR POWER SHUT OFF BY P. JEANNIE -- BECAUSE OF SEVERE WIND WARNINGS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT FORTY ONE CIRCUITS WERE SHUT OFF FACT IN ROUGHLY SIXTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS. OVER A THREE DAY PERIOD IT TOOK THREE DAYS BEFORE ALL THE CIRCUITS COULD BE -- TURNED BACK ON BECAUSE P. GINNY HAD TO GO OUT AND INSPECT EVERYTHING -- THIS CREATE A NUMBER OF DIFFICULTIES THAT THE PC IS CURRENTLY DEALING WITH AND THE REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS -- BUT HAD A NUMBER OF IMPACT ON WATER UTILITIES WASTE WATER DISTRICTS -- AND ESPECIALLY RESIDENTS -- THOSE RESIDENTS IN RURAL AREAS THAT RELY ON GROUNDWATER WELLS OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS AND SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE POWER TO FLUSH TOILETS TAKE SHOWERS. UNLESS THEY COULD GO TO A COMMUNITY CENTER -- OR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO DO THAT SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWO OH NINE WE HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WE CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. TO TRY AND REDUCE ANY POTENTIAL AND ON RATE PAYERS -- TO UTILIZE THE EXISTING NETWORK OF MONITORING STATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE AT THE STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVEL AND UTILITY LEVEL AND DRIVE VOTE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WOULD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE WHOLESALERS ASSOCIATION. ANYTHING THE STATE CAN DO TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES OR LOSSES FROM WILDFIRES WILL BENEFIT THE AFFORDABILITY IN THE AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE -- WHICH IS BEGINNING TO BE AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE'D LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL INNER DRIVE A THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER NORWOOD ANY OTHER SPEAKERS WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON ACROSS THE BEHALF OF THE INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU.

ANY AT BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AS I SAID MY IN MY STATEMENT IS WE DON'T HAVE THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I I WOULD LOOK AT THIS IS DUPLICATIVE WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT IS IT'S COOPERATIVE WITH SANDY -- YOU PARTICULARLY USING THE CAMERA YOU HAVE THEIR THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE COMING AND THE WIND MONITORING STATIONS WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE DUPLICATION AND AND MORE MORE COSTS WE WANT TO SHARE RESOURCES. NOT ONLY OF LIKE THE UTILITIES BUT ALSO THE UC SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE CAMERAS AND ALL THOSE THINGS WOULD COME INTO THESE -- WHETHER MOTT MONITORING STATIONS IT'LL JUST MAKE THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- INCREDIBLY MORE EFFECTIVE AT DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT AND I YOU KNOW MY CONCERNS ARE.
