I STAND HERE TODAY ASKING FOR THIS AUGUST BODY TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF. JOHN ROBERT LOUIS AN AMERICAN ICON A PUBLIC SERVANT TO THE HIGH SIXTEEN INDIVIDUAL WHO. DEMONSTRATED ON A DAILY BASIS THAT LOVE WILL CONQUER ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD I INDIVIDUAL WHO WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU LOOK AT THE BLACK LIVES MATTER AND ALL THE YOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE ACTIVATED IT WAS THROUGH HIS EXAMPLE. AS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. WHO WENT TO. GEORGIA AND GOT INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WITH DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD A TEENAGER MANY TIMES WE ATTRIBUTE. WELL LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING AND- RALPH ABERNATHY AND- JULIAN BOND IN INDIVIDUALS LIKE THAT FOR THE CITY AND BUT IT WAS THE YOUNG FOLKS WHO REALLY SAT DOWN. JOHN LEWIS. SAT DOWN FOR US TO STAND UP. JOHN LEWIS STOOD UP. SO WE COULD ENTER PLACES THAT WE COULD GO BEFORE. JOHN LEWIS WAS ARRESTED OVER FORTY TIMES IN HIS LIFE. DURING PEACEFUL PROTEST SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT WE SEE TODAY AND IT'S SOMEWHAT SAT BACK SOME OF THE FEDERAL RESPONSE IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE SIXTIES SUPPOSED TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CROSSING IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE OF THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE WHERE JOHN LEWIS. CAME WITHIN INCHES OF LOSING HIS LIFE THIS CALL WAS CRUSHED. BY BILLY CLUB BY STATE TROOPERS THE SAME STATE TROOPERS WHO YESTERDAY ESCORTED HIS CASKET. AND HIS- HIS COFFIN ANA ACROSS THAT MEANT PETTUS BRIDGE A SYMBOLISM OF. THE MOVEMENT AND THE GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH TO DO. I'M HONORED TO HAVE MET MISTER LEWIS DURING THE COURSE OF MY LIFE. WE WERE FRATERNITY BROTHERS WERE PROUD MEMBERS OF PHI BETA SIGMA FRATERNITY. AND I WAS ALWAYS. HONOR TO INTERACT WITH THEM AND YOU ALWAYS CALL ME MY BROTHER SO I'M HONOR TO HAVE SERVED THROUGH A FRATERNITY OF FRATERNAL ORDER WITH MISTER LEWIS BUT I'M MORE HONOR TO HAVE MET SOMEONE. WHO LIVED A LIFE OF LOVE. OF GENEROSITY A INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD THE COURAGE OF A WARRIOR. THE FIERCENESS OF A WARRIOR BUT OUR HEART OF AN ANGEL. A MAN WHO GOOD FOR DO YOU HAVE THE KKK. INDIVIDUAL WHO NEARLY BEAT HIM TO DEATH SOME FORTY YEARS LATER THEY MATT AND HIS OFFICE IN WASHINGTON DC AND NOT ONLY THE FORGIVEN HE HUGGED ON ANY SAYS I LOVE YOU MY BROTHER. THAT TO JOHN LEWIS WAS THAT TWO YEARS AND WE SHOULD ALL STRIVE TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE. I INDIVIDUAL AGAIN WHO STOOD FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. VOTING RIGHTS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS I ASKED THE OUIJA EARN IN HONOR OF JOHN LEWIS. AND. MADAM PRO THANK YOU AN IMPRESSIVE TELL A SEVERAS TO MEN OF A LOVED NATIONAL YOU REP JOHN ROBERT LOUIS. CONGRESSMAN LEWIS WAS TRUE A RIGHT FORCE AND ARE REAL FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN LIBERTY. FROM LEADERSHIP DURING THE SUNDAY MARCH ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN SELMA. HAVING CHAMPION THE EQUALITY ACT TO END DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT Q. AMERICANS. CONGRESSMAN LEWIS TAUGHT US WHAT BRAVERY LOOK LIKE A NEVER HESITATED IN HIS PURSUIT LIBERTY AT HIS DECADES OF SERVICE. HE ALSO NEVER STOPPED AND- FUTURE GENERATIONS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN HE CAME TO COMIC CON IN SAN DIEGO AND COSPLAY HIMSELF SPORTING A JACKET. AND A BACKPACK LIKE THE ONES HE WORE WHEN HE LED THE MARCH ACROSS THE BRIDGE TO MONTGOMERY ALABAMA. ALTHOUGH KING A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD VERSION OF HIMSELF HE LED A GROUP OF CHILDREN IN A MARCH. THROUGH THE CONVENTION CENTER SHOWING THEM THAT YOU DON'T NEED A CAKE OR SUPER POWERS TO BE A HERO. P. DID THAT TRIP AND THE MARCH THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS. HE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ME AND TO ALL WHO BELIEVE TRUE EQUALITY IS A CALL IS WORTHY OF SACRIFICE AND HIS LEGACY REMAINS A BEACON OF HOPE FOR ALL WHO CHAMPION JUSTICE. WE GRIEVE THE LOSS OF CONGRESSMAN LEWIS AND WE CARRY HIS WISDOM AND ENERGY FORWARD AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE EQUALITY INCLUSIVITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR DRAWS A. FROM I NEED TO ALSO INCLUDE IN ALL OF THE WORDS THAT WE'RE ALL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN LEWIS IS THE ROLE THAT HE PLAYED IN RAISING THE PROFILE AND THE NEED TO INCLUDE THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS IN OUR STRUGGLES HERE IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE DID THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS FREEDOM RIDE. COURSE IN HONOR NOT OF RESPECT FOR WHAT THE FREEDOM. RIDERS HAD DONE A DECADES BEFORE- AND HE DID NOT HESITATE- TO BECOME OF THE NATIONAL CO CHAIR ALONG WITH REVEREND JAMES LAWSON- SO I AM. PERSONALLY AND DEEPLY- INDEBTED FOR THE ROLE THAT HE PLAYED. AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO- I THINK RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HE ALSO GOT ARRESTED- IN WASHINGTON DC ON ISSUES OF IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS AS HUMAN RIGHTS SO. WE ALSO- HONOR HIS ROLE IN THIS NATION FOR ALL PEOPLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE. INTERNET MEMORIES PLEASE BRING HIS NAME FORWARD SO HE CAN BE APPROPRIATELY MEMORIALIZED BY THE SENATE. IF THERE IS NO OTHER BUSINESS SENATOR ACTIONS THE DESK IS CLEAR THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU AND CERTAINLY MY APOLOGIES.
