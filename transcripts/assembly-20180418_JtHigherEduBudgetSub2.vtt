SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH LCF

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.225 region:rollup2
HALF?

THE. FINAL BUDGET SO WITH THAT

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.779 region:rollup2
BALLOTS BEGIN BLAST FIRST THE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO GIVE US

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.016 region:rollup2
AN OVERVIEW.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.885 region:rollup2
IT THINK HUMOR ITS VOTE HE SAU

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.486 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL FOR

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:12.225 region:rollup2
STUDENT FOCUSED FUNDING FORMULA

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.760 region:rollup2
I WANT TO BEGIN BY. I'M

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.729 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.230 region:rollup2
ON THE EXISTING MODEL AND

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.865 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS AND AND

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.333 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THE EXISTING I'M

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:22.736 region:rollup2
FUNNY MODEL. SO COMMITTEE

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.470 region:rollup2
COLLEGES CURRENTLY RECEIVE ABOUT

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.871 region:rollup2
THREE QUARTERS OF DEFINING

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.673 region:rollup2
THROUGH GENERAL PURPOSE PORTION

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.775 region:rollup2
MEN'S IT'S ABOUT SEVEN.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.443 region:rollup2
AT BILLION FOR PORTION MEN'S

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.713 region:rollup2
PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:33.647 region:rollup2
BUDGET. A PORTION OF FUNDING IS

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.648 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED TO DISTRICT.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.782 region:rollup2
TO DISTRICTS BASED PRIMARILY ON

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.118 region:rollup2
A ROMANCE OF FULL TIME

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:39.786 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT STUDENTS AB T. S..

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:41.455 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE THAT F. T. AS HIS

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:43.056 region:rollup2
GENERATED GENERALLY CALCULATED

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:44.691 region:rollup2
ON ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS AT A

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:46.226 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME WHICH

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.894 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY OCCURS AT AT SAYS

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.662 region:rollup2
SENSES STATE EARLY AM IN THE

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.263 region:rollup2
TERM.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.764 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT FUNDING MODELS

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.265 region:rollup2
OFTEN THE MODELS CREATE

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:54.301 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.635 region:rollup2
AND A PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THE

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:57.204 region:rollup2
EXISTING A ROMAN BASE FUNNY

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:58.905 region:rollup2
MODEL IS THAT IT ENCOURAGES

00:03:57.204 --> 00:04:00.774 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO PRIORITIZE.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.608 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT AND ENROLLMENT

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:03.677 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.978 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REGARD FOR STUDENT

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.980 region:rollup2
SUCCESS SUCH AS TIMELY

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:08.315 region:rollup2
COMPLETION AND BETTER SERVING

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.916 region:rollup2
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:11.218 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT MODEL ACTUALLY

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.886 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGES DISTRICTS FROM

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:14.688 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT REDUCE

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:16.556 region:rollup2
I'M ACCESS UNITS AN INCREASE

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.991 region:rollup2
TIMELY COMPLETION GIVEN THAT

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:20.293 region:rollup2
THAT CAN RESULT IN A REDUCTION

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:21.628 region:rollup2
OF AB T. AS. AND AS A RESULT OF

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:23.263 region:rollup2
REDUCTION OF REVENUE FOR THE

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.798 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.166 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING ENROLLMENT BASED

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.667 region:rollup2
MONEY MODEL IS ALSO CREATING

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:29.703 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM PLANNING

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:31.037 region:rollup2
HARDSHIPS FOR DISTRICTS BECAUSE

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.706 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROMANCE IS

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:34.040 region:rollup2
COUNTER CYCLICAL TO THAT KIND OF

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:35.408 region:rollup2
ME. SO WE KNOW THAT WHEN

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.576 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:39.179 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGE ENROLLMENT

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:39.746 region:rollup2
REMAINS FLATTER DECLINE SWITCHES

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:41.548 region:rollup2
WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:42.449 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN ECONOMIC

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:45.118 region:rollup2
TIMES ARE BAD.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.386 region:rollup2
A ROMAN DEMAND INCREASES AT THE

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.455 region:rollup2
SAME TIME FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:50.323 region:rollup2
COLLEGE GENERALLY INCREASES WHEN

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.725 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD AND

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:53.860 region:rollup2
DECLINES WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES OUR

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:54.561 region:rollup2
BATTLE IS REALLY. A DISCONNECT

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.996 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:57.397 region:rollup2
SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.932 region:rollup2
PROPOSES IN NEW SUIT AND FOCUS

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:00.433 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:02.435 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE EDGES

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:04.337 region:rollup2
THAT RECOGNIZES FACTORS BEYOND

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.672 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.274 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ENROLLED.

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:08.575 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ALIGN THE

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:11.778 region:rollup2
FUNNY MODEL WITH THE GOALS OF

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.778 region:rollup2
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND THE

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:14.714 region:rollup2
SERVE STUDENTS AND TO ELIMINATE

00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:16.516 region:rollup2
EQUITY CAPS.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:18.151 region:rollup2
MOVING AWAY FROM ENROLLMENT BASE

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.686 region:rollup2
FUNNY MODEL IS ALSO EXPECTED TO

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.188 region:rollup2
CREATE GREATER FISCAL STABILITY

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.923 region:rollup2
FOR DISTRICTS.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:24.925 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:26.960 region:rollup2
BUDGET AT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.695 region:rollup2
FOR COLLEGES TO GROW FISCALLY BY

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.597 region:rollup2
IMPROVING ON STUDENT SUCCESS

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:32.732 region:rollup2
METRICS AND ENSURING ACCESS FOR

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:34.134 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME STUDENTS.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:36.503 region:rollup2
BY MOVING AWAY FROM ENROLLMENT

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:38.438 region:rollup2
GROWTH MODEL AND SAID FOCUSING

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.673 region:rollup2
ON TIMELY COMPLETION OF

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:41.474 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REDUCING

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:43.343 region:rollup2
EXCESS UNITS AND FURTHERING

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:45.312 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS. IT ALSO

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.780 region:rollup2
EXPANDS ACCESS BY CREATING ROOM

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:48.481 region:rollup2
FOR ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT WHICH

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.816 region:rollup2
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.151 region:rollup2
A RECESSION.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.419 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS THE

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.987 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.956 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA FOR PORTION

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:57.190 region:rollup2

SLIPPED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:08.168 region:rollup2
STUDENT RATE AS THAT WOULD BE A

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.061 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRANTS.

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:10.096 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PROPOSAL DISTRICTS

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.431 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ALIGN

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.899 region:rollup2
I'D THE GOALS IN THEIR EDUCATION

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.767 region:rollup2
MASTER PLANS WHAT THE GOALS

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.902 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN THE VISION FOR

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.037 region:rollup2
SUCCESS INCLUDING ACTIONS FOR

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.905 region:rollup2
MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARDS A

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:20.640 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS. AND DISTRICTS WOULD BE

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:22.776 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO ALIGN THEIR BUDGETS

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.077 region:rollup2
WITHOUT REVISED AT MASTER PLAN

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.578 region:rollup2
BY THE DATE DETERMINED BY THE

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:27.480 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:28.682 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS TRANSITION

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.283 region:rollup2
TO THIS NEW STUDENT CENTER

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:31.618 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA THE GOVERNOR'S

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.453 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.988 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.623 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:38.858 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT NO DISTRICT RECEIVES

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:40.627 region:rollup2
LESS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:42.529 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT A FUNDING FORMULA

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.397 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:46.399 region:rollup2
TO THIS HOLD HARMLESS. AFTER THE

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.933 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.102 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE AN EIGHTEEN

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:50.737 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EACH DISTRICT WOULD

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:52.605 region:rollup2
RECEIVE NO LESS THAN THE TOTAL

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:53.373 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT FUNDING THAT THE

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.608 region:rollup2
DISTRICT RECEIVED AND SEVENTEEN

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:57.010 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN. EACH YEAR THERE AFTER

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:59.212 region:rollup2
THE HOLD HARMLESS WILL BE

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.047 region:rollup2
CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:03.483 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PURSUED AT

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:04.884 region:rollup2
RATES TIMES THE ABBOTT DISTRICTS

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.719 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.354 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:08.788 region:rollup2
INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:10.357 region:rollup2
POINT TWO MILLION PROPOSITION

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.591 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.426 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FIVE ONE COST OF

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:15.028 region:rollup2
LIVING ADJUSTMENTS. THESE FUNDS

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.463 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE BASE

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:18.765 region:rollup2
RATES OF THE PROPOSED A FUNDING

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:20.900 region:rollup2
FORMULA. AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:22.402 region:rollup2
BASE RESOURCES FOR DISTRICTS.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.070 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY A NOTE ON

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:25.672 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AT THE

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.073 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS ON THE

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.775 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO CONSULT

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:31.211 region:rollup2
WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.746 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:34.247 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE MAY REVISIONS THAT

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:36.282 region:rollup2
WOULD CONSOLIDATE CATEGORICAL

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:37.450 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND AND THE GOAL HERE

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:39.386 region:rollup2
IS REALLY TO CREATE A MORE

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.621 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY WE OFTEN

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:42.889 region:rollup2
HEAR. THAT THERE'S A NEED AYE

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:44.524 region:rollup2
FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY SO COLLEGES

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.626 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO BEST A DEPLOY THE

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.228 region:rollup2
RESOURCES I TO MEET THEIR.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.362 region:rollup2
LOCAL NEEDS THE MOST

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:51.398 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY WAY

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:53.700 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE SO AND THAT THAT'S

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:55.335 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMPONENT OF OF THE

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.303 region:rollup2
BROADER AND FRAMEWORK. AND I

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:59.406 region:rollup2
THINK YOU ARE HERE TO ANSWER

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:02.709 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:03.309 region:rollup2
THANK YOU LA.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.377 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON NETWORK BROUGHT

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.979 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:08.014 region:rollup2
OFFICE. AND I THINK THIS IS AN

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:08.715 region:rollup2
ISSUE IT DESCRIPTIVE AT THAT

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:10.250 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THAT THE

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.085 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S HAD A SIGNIFICANT

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.453 region:rollup2
TRISTEN NAME A NUMBER OF ANGLES.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:15.088 region:rollup2
I'M FIRST OF THE CHAIRMAN JIM

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:16.756 region:rollup2
THERE IS INTERESTING AND NOT

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:17.590 region:rollup2
REFORMING THE FUNDING FORMULA

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.324 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE AFTER OFFICE

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.826 region:rollup2
TO.

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.795 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE FUNDING AND

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:23.263 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR FIRST GENERATION

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:26.032 region:rollup2
AND LOW INCOME. I'M.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:26.966 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THEY ARE IN DIRE

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.700 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BECAUSE BUT ALSO TO

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:30.136 region:rollup2
YOU SEE SEAT AT THE IF YOU

SYSTEM. AND OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.639 region:rollup2
A REPORT IN LATE DECEMBER THAT.

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.507 region:rollup2
LAID OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:35.408 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO OPTIONS FOR REFORM

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:37.377 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDE A WE DID STERN

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:41.247 region:rollup2
FORMULA AURA. AND CONSOLIDATED

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:42.382 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATING CATEGORICAL

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.116 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS INTO A BLOCK GRANT.

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:43.383 region:rollup2
AND THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.517 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.118 region:rollup2
OUR EFFORTS NOT ON THE FUNDING

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.286 region:rollup2
SITE BUT IN THE INTEREST OF

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:48.254 region:rollup2
IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES OVER

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.422 region:rollup2
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND I'M

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.757 region:rollup2
WE DO OUR HAND OUT THOSE PASSED

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.391 region:rollup2
A TWO AND ON PAGE TWO OF THAT

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.158 region:rollup2
HAND OUT WE WALKED THROUGH MANY

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.194 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:55.161 region:rollup2
RECENT STUDENTS THAT SUPPORT

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.296 region:rollup2
EFFORTS

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:58.064 region:rollup2
I'M BEGINNING WITH THAT THE

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:59.399 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS TASK FORCE AND

00:09:58.064 --> 00:10:00.967 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRIPLETS

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.935 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEM THE STUDENTS ACROSS

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.169 region:rollup2
IN SPORT PROGRAM.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:05.004 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:06.739 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR BASIC SKILLS TO

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:08.842 region:rollup2
IMPROVE REMEDIATION EFFORTS.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.876 region:rollup2
I'M THE LEGISLATURE ALSO I'M A

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:11.077 region:rollup2
TOOK ACTION TO.

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:12.846 region:rollup2
CREATE THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:13.980 region:rollup2
TRANSFER AREN'T TO STREAMLINE

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:15.148 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRED FROM

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.884 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.451 region:rollup2
CSU SYSTEM SO. A LOT OF INTEREST

00:10:17.884 --> 00:10:18.685 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA IN A NUMBER OF

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.386 region:rollup2
WAYS.

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.921 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:23.523 region:rollup2
I WOULD AND INCOMES OR HAND ARE

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.057 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU MOVE TO PAGE FIVE I

00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:26.125 region:rollup2
THINK THE MISTRESS TO WALK

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:27.327 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT. THE COMPONENTS OF

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.028 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL.

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:29.696 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT DETAIL I THINK ARE

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.763 region:rollup2
JUST.

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:32.665 region:rollup2
I'M IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.932 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I DO THINK WE WE

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.002 region:rollup2
THINK IT.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:38.471 region:rollup2
PARA WE DO RECOMMEND MOVING TO

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:39.839 region:rollup2
AN APPROACH THAT HAS A CHANGE OF

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.508 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FOR ME TO INCLUDE A

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:43.376 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT. I'M

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:43.843 region:rollup2
SO MUCH OF ADMINISTRATION.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.279 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:47.714 region:rollup2
WE SHARE MANY OF THE SAME

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.548 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.082 region:rollup2
HAS WITH REGARDS TO THE COURT

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:51.484 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT BASED. APPROACH

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:52.785 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.586 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS INHIBIT SOME

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.822 region:rollup2
INNOVATION BY.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:57.056 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MANY

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:58.791 region:rollup2
OF THE REFORMS THAT WE WANT TO

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.359 region:rollup2
BLACKS YOU. COULD RESULT IN

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:01.327 region:rollup2
FEWER.

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:03.062 region:rollup2
UNITS BEING TAKEN BY STUDENTS

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:05.598 region:rollup2
SO I'M WE WE WE SERVE THOSE

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:07.967 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND WE THINK ALSO THAT

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:09.836 region:rollup2
THE. ARAB PROVIDING THAT THIS

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:11.838 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AT THE FUNDING COMPONENT

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:13.306 region:rollup2
REALLY OUTLINES ARE A LOT OF THE

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.307 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FROM THAT SOLVE TO

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:15.074 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE GOALS THAT THE

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:17.477 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS FOR THE SYSTEM

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:18.311 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF. IMPROVING OUTOMES.

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.980 region:rollup2
AND.

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:22.382 region:rollup2
IT AN IMPROVING THOSE IN A MORE

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.883 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER.

00:11:22.382 --> 00:11:25.151 region:rollup2
WE DID LOOK AT WHAT THE RESEARCH

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:26.719 region:rollup2
SHOWS BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:28.521 region:rollup2
THAN THIRTY STATES ARM WHO DO

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:29.155 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME PERFORMANCE BASED

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.290 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:32.025 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.760 region:rollup2
NUMBER THAT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.261 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL I'M. OF THERE'S A

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.795 region:rollup2
CORRELATION BETWEEN CHANGING

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.330 region:rollup2
YOUR FUNDING FORMULA TO A

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:39.532 region:rollup2
PERFRMANCE BASED ARE FUNDING

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.600 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND SING INSTITUTIONAL

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.834 region:rollup2
CHANGES MANY OF WHICH I THINK WE

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.102 region:rollup2
WOULD CONSIDER. THE KINDS OF

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.437 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.905 region:rollup2
BEEN WANTING TO SEE OF THE LAST

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:47.907 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS THINGS LIKE. I'M

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:50.877 region:rollup2
CHANGING ARE THE YOUR APPROACH

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:51.411 region:rollup2
TO TO REMEDIATION TO IMPROVE

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.178 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR BASIC SKILLS

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.179 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.415 region:rollup2
I'M PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:56.883 region:rollup2
ADVISING IN SUPPORT STUDENTS SO

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:59.719 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MEANT TO HELP GET THEM

00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.887 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SYSTEM M. DROP OPENS

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.122 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.856 region:rollup2
NUMBER DESPITE THOSE CHANGES IN

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:05.124 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR THAT THE RESEARCH

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:07.727 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SHOW A SIGNIFICANT

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:08.294 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN. INSTANT OUTCOMES

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.796 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK WE WE MEANT TO

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:10.930 region:rollup2
ADJUST THE STATE THIS IN AND OF

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:12.765 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS NOT IS NOT GONNA BE

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.333 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:15.034 region:rollup2
CHANGES BUT WE THINK IT'S

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.135 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT. THAT IS WORTH

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:17.503 region:rollup2
PURSUING BECAUSE IT DOES HELP

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:19.272 region:rollup2
ONLINE THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.273 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM WITH WITH VOTE THE

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.241 region:rollup2
FUNDING APPROACH.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:23.409 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.544 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THERE A COUPLE OF KEY

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.378 region:rollup2
THINGS IN UP AT SIX O'CLOCK OR

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:27.113 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.680 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH THE SPECIFIC

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.648 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.984 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:31.951 region:rollup2
FIRST IN TERMS OF THE THOSE

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.753 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES BASED.

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.687 region:rollup2
COMPONENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.422 region:rollup2
BUDGET WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:38.558 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE. THE THE INCENTIVES

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.959 region:rollup2
THAT THEY COULD CREATE UNTIL THE

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.427 region:rollup2
FIRST IS RELATED TO.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.195 region:rollup2
TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:45.465 region:rollup2
OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE.

00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:46.432 region:rollup2
WHO COME INTO THE SYSTEM? WE

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:47.700 region:rollup2
LEFT PREPARED IF LIKELY TO IT TO

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.469 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM. I'M THE

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.169 region:rollup2
FORMULA CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:51.404 region:rollup2
ENROLL MORE OF THE STUDENTS

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:53.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A SPECIFIC

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:54.807 region:rollup2
COMPONENT FOR. A GOING CONCERN

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.309 region:rollup2
COUNTS BUT THERE ISN'T A

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:59.712 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INCENTIVE TO HELP

00:12:56.309 --> 00:13:01.014 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THEIR

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:01.681 region:rollup2
DEGREE ERA OR.

00:13:01.014 --> 00:13:02.749 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE OR TO TRANSFER IN A

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.017 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER THIS IS SOMETHING

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.717 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER IN

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:05.985 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES WHEN THEY'VE

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:07.754 region:rollup2
ADOPTED THESE.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:09.288 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF FORMULAS ARM

00:13:07.754 --> 00:13:10.556 region:rollup2
THAT OFTENTIMES ARE COLLEGES

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.058 region:rollup2
MIGHT CHOOSE TO FOR EXAMPLE

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:13.259 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON STUDENTS ONE OF THE

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.661 region:rollup2
MOST PREPARED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.294 region:rollup2
FIND IT TO BE MORE COST

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:15.828 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY OF IMPROVING THEIR

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.864 region:rollup2
OUTCOME.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:19.198 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK ONE WAY DEBT TO

00:13:17.864 --> 00:13:21.367 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IS TO PROVIDE

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.934 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE ALL A FUNDING SO THAT

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.969 region:rollup2
YOU PROVIDE HIGHER OUTCOMES

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.670 region:rollup2
BASED FUNDING.

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.971 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.706 region:rollup2
FOR THE OUTCOMES OF LOW INCOME

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:28.341 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:29.976 region:rollup2
BUT SIMILARLY WE WEREN'T WE SAW

00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:30.877 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH OF CONCERNS ON ON

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.779 region:rollup2
THE.

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:34.013 region:rollup2
AND SOME COLLEGE OF MOVING TO

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.848 region:rollup2
MORE SHORT TERM.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:38.017 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AS BECAUSE

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:39.986 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE CHEAPER YOU ACTED TO

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:40.920 region:rollup2
PRODUCE OUTCOMES TO IMPROVE

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.921 region:rollup2
INCREASE YOUR FUNDING.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.723 region:rollup2
IT'S I THINK AGAIN WE THINK OF

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.825 region:rollup2
ONE ONE THING FOR YOU TO

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:47.093 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IS ARE MAKING A

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:47.760 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:50.029 region:rollup2
OCCAM'S YOU PROVIDE FOR SOME OF

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.097 region:rollup2
THOSE. HIGH COST PROGRAMS FOR

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.131 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SOME OF CITY PROGRAMS

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:54.801 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE A MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:56.636 region:rollup2
COLLEGES. TO OPERATE BUT BUT WE

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:59.105 region:rollup2
THINK ARE ARE ARE PROVIDED A

00:13:56.636 --> 00:14:00.239 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE VALUE.

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.941 region:rollup2
THE THE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:03.409 region:rollup2
COMES UP THAT WE THINK ERA CAN

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:04.744 region:rollup2
BE A THOUGHT BY MONITORING ERA

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:06.245 region:rollup2
IS IS THIS CONCERN THAT THERE

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:07.647 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE INFLATION UPGRADES OF

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:09.716 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:11.351 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE REWARDED

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:12.185 region:rollup2
BY GETTING STUDENTS UP THE DOOR

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.553 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE WE'VE

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.088 region:rollup2
HEARD IN OTHER STATES AS A

00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:15.922 region:rollup2
CONCERN THERE IS ENOUGH EARLY

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.023 region:rollup2
STRONG EVIDENCE THAT IT'S

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:19.492 region:rollup2
HAPPENING BUT WE DO THINK

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:21.060 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN. ADDRESS

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:22.729 region:rollup2
BY HAVING ADDITIONAL MONITORING.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.364 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:26.199 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSOLIDATING OUR ORDERED

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.766 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THEIR OTHER THE

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.469 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WHICH

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:31.204 region:rollup2
REPRESENT. ABOUT A QUARTER OF

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.038 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE NINETY FUNDING WE

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.773 region:rollup2
DO THINK THAT IT'S BONTA

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.541 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THOSE PROGRAMS IN

00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:37.210 region:rollup2
TANDEM WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.411 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT'S PART OF THE

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.579 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FORMULA.

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:41.280 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE FORMULAS ARE BOTH

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:42.482 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.050 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN RECOGNITION THAT

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.617 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS IN THE

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.985 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT NEED ADDITIONAL

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.453 region:rollup2
SUPPORT. AND WE THINK THERE'S A

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:49.322 region:rollup2
BIT OF A DISCONNECT RIGHT NOW

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:51.491 region:rollup2
WITH ONE FUNDING STREAM THAT'S A

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:52.558 region:rollup2
VERY FLEXIBLE ARE VERY FEW

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:54.060 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND IN THE

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.628 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL AS WITH A LOT OF

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.896 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS. ARE A BUNCH OF

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:59.465 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR VERY

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.899 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PURPOSES.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.667 region:rollup2
SO IN TERMS OF OUR

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.903 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS I'M WE DO

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:06.139 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND YEAH I'M SHIFTING OUR

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.974 region:rollup2
APPROACH. AND AND WE THINK I'M

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:09.375 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO SORT OF. EXACTLY

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:10.143 region:rollup2
HARDER FAST RULE FOR WHAT WE

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.844 region:rollup2
THINK MAKES SENSE BUT WE DO

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.779 region:rollup2
THINK THERE. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.013 region:rollup2
APPROACH OF.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:15.081 region:rollup2
SHIFTING TO ONLY HALF OF THE

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:17.083 region:rollup2
FORMULA BEING BASED ON

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.351 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IS REASONABLE.

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:20.453 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THINK THAT PROVIDING I'M

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:21.621 region:rollup2
FUNDING BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:23.423 region:rollup2
WE'VE YOU WANTED TO KEEP IT IS

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:24.457 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL SO THAT YOU HAVE

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.058 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES FOR

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:27.126 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WE THINK. BASED ON WHAT

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.194 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THE RESEARCH THAT

00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:30.296 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OR MORE.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:31.397 region:rollup2
IS IS IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.899 region:rollup2
THAT THE CASE.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.567 region:rollup2
I'M AS I MENTIONED WE DO

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.435 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT YOU THAT THAT THE

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.602 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES BASED COMPONENTS

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.804 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SO THAT YOU PROVIDING

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.304 region:rollup2
MORE OUTCOME MORE FUNDING FOR

00:15:37.804 --> 00:15:39.472 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.740 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:42.408 region:rollup2
AND FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE HIGH

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.676 region:rollup2
VALUE PROGRAMS.

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:45.278 region:rollup2
I'M AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:46.145 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WE WOULD

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.447 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND LOOKING AT THE

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.815 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND THE

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:51.818 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS TOGETHER.

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:53.619 region:rollup2
COLLAPSING THEM INTO ONE LARGER.

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:55.021 region:rollup2
POT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.622 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD SPECIFY THAT

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.757 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS THAT. THAT YEAR

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:59.725 region:rollup2
INTENDING TO SERVE WITHOUT

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:02.028 region:rollup2
AMOUNT AND THEN HAVE FEW STRINGS

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:02.929 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REPORTING

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:04.597 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.897 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING. IS BEING SPENT AT

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:06.232 region:rollup2
EACH COLLEGE

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.800 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.302 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE WE DO RECOMMEND

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.870 region:rollup2
MONITORING A COUPLE ASPECTS TO

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:12.371 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEING

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.540 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED.

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:15.741 region:rollup2
MONITORING A NEW PROGRAM OR AT

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.409 region:rollup2
THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.277 region:rollup2
CREATED TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:20.379 region:rollup2
NOT SERVE ONLY FOCUS ON THE

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:22.215 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM PROGRAMS. MONITOR

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.216 region:rollup2
GREAT RELATED DATA TO IT TO

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.884 region:rollup2
MONITOR TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:27.119 region:rollup2
KIND OF GRADE INFLATION. AND.

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:28.654 region:rollup2
MONITORING THE TYPES OF.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.489 region:rollup2
DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.157 region:rollup2
AWARDED TO SEE IF WE ARE.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.691 region:rollup2
SEEING A DIFFERENCE IN THAT THE

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.558 region:rollup2
KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:36.262 region:rollup2
BEING.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:37.396 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE BY COLLEGES.

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:38.631 region:rollup2
SO DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:40.399 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.968 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MANY COLLEGES CHRISTOS

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.036 region:rollup2
MANY OF US CHANCELLOR FOR THEIR

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:45.171 region:rollup2
TELL PARTICULARLY COLLEGES. BUT.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.739 region:rollup2
I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT WE'VE

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.874 region:rollup2
PASSED OUT TOO MANY OF THE

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.375 region:rollup2
SLIDES COVER MUCH OF THE GROUND

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:50.676 region:rollup2
THAT WAS COVERED BY THE OTHER

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.645 region:rollup2
PRISONERS ALL MOVE QUICKLY

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:54.180 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEM. BOB TO BEGIN I

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:55.481 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WE SUPPORT

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.049 region:rollup2
THE FRAMEWORK PROPOSED IN THE

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.251 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE THINK THERE

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.252 region:rollup2
ARE WAYS WE CAN PROVE THE

00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:01.020 region:rollup2
FORMULA ITSELF.

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.487 region:rollup2
AND WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.923 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:04.524 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I'LL TALK TO

00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:06.659 region:rollup2
YOU MORE OF OUR THOUGHTS AS WE

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.893 region:rollup2
MOVE ALONG. I JUST TO BE CLEAR

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:08.361 region:rollup2
AS WE.

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:10.596 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.531 region:rollup2
FINANCE ALL THE TALKING BOTH

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:14.433 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GENERAL PORTION

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.700 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND ABOUT CATEGORICAL

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.502 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.137 region:rollup2
SO PAGE TWO COVERS OUR CURRENT

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:18.804 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AGAIN AND THE

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:21.274 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:23.075 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN THIS WELL WE FUNDED

00:17:21.274 --> 00:17:24.510 region:rollup2
GENERAL PORSCHE MEANT BASED ON A

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:26.145 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF STATE FUNDS

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.980 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES AND ENROLLMENT

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.649 region:rollup2
FEES DISTRICTS RECEIVE THOSE

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.284 region:rollup2
FUNDS CURRENTLY LARGELY ON THE

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:32.785 region:rollup2
BASIS OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.953 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ENROLLED. WE'VE GOT

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.855 region:rollup2
SOME FUNDING.

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:37.490 region:rollup2
IN THERE ALSO BASED ON THE

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:39.659 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND CENTERS

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.960 region:rollup2
IN A DISTRICT AS WELL SOME OTHER

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.261 region:rollup2
DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS THE

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.896 region:rollup2
MOST PROMINENT IS.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.997 region:rollup2
SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.565 region:rollup2
RURAL DISTRICTS.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:48.334 region:rollup2
AND IN IN ADDITION TO THE

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.835 region:rollup2
GENERAL APPORTIONMENT WE FUND A

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:51.304 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS ABOUT A

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:53.539 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE FUNDING IS FINANCE

00:17:51.304 --> 00:17:55.374 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS FOR THOSE PURPOSES.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.809 region:rollup2
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT STUDENT

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:58.110 region:rollup2
SERVICES CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.145 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THE STUDENT SUCCESS

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.280 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT PROGRAM STUDENT

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:02.448 region:rollup2
EQUITY PROGRAM. BASIC SKILLS BUT

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.250 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE CATEGORICAL

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:05.618 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR ECONOMIC AND

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.852 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:08.254 region:rollup2
THE MOST PROMINENT ONE IS THE

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:09.121 region:rollup2
STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM YOU ALL

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.190 region:rollup2
CREATED.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.991 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGO A WE HAVE A

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.259 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:14.827 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIONAL KIKWIT MAKE

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.862 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL AND SO WE HAVE WE

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:18.464 region:rollup2
HAVE CATEGORICAL IS FOR A NUMBER

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.532 region:rollup2
OF PURPOSES.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:21.033 region:rollup2
ON PAGE THREE.

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.601 region:rollup2
WE SHOW THE DATA THAT FINANCE

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.936 region:rollup2
REFERENCED

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.971 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN BILLION

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.138 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.607 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT WHEN YOU TAKE INTO

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:28.941 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THE STATE FUNDS THE

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.177 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES IN THE STUDENT

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:33.412 region:rollup2
FEES. THE REMAINDER OF FUNDING.

00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:35.214 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:35.748 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.817 region:rollup2
IN THE FORM OF CATEGORICAL

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:38.985 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:40.820 region:rollup2
PAGE FOUR IS THE PROBLEM

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:42.388 region:rollup2
STATEMENT AGAIN WE'VE TALKED

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.990 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW I THINK.

00:18:42.388 --> 00:18:44.290 region:rollup2
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.592 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.827 region:rollup2
BUT THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IN

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:49.228 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM I THINK IT'S ONE OF

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:51.697 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WE ARE.

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:52.698 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE THINK WE HAVE IT

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:54.433 region:rollup2
OUR BOARD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.502 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES COMMUNITY

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.303 region:rollup2
COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE MOST

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.405 region:rollup2
STUDENTS DON'T.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:01.273 region:rollup2
ATTAINED A DEGREE OR

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:02.708 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER THOSE

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:05.111 region:rollup2
THAT DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:06.612 region:rollup2
SO AND WE SEE GAPS BOTH ACROSS

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.813 region:rollup2
STUDENT GROUPS ACROSS REGIONS.

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:09.415 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.616 region:rollup2
PRINT PERVERSE INCENTIVES

00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:12.284 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ECONOMIC AND

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.486 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS THAT WE

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:14.987 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.088 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.390 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:20.126 region:rollup2
GRADUATION ARMS.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.594 region:rollup2
CLASS SIZES AND ECONOMIC

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:23.329 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS WHEN THOSE.

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:25.331 region:rollup2
TRANSMIT ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.165 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.867 region:rollup2
SOME PAGE FIVE.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.135 region:rollup2
MMHM

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:30.736 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO MAKE

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:32.238 region:rollup2
EXPLICIT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.838 region:rollup2
WITH THE FOREIGN LET ME THINK

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.340 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT THINGS

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.908 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING. BOB ONE OF

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.476 region:rollup2
THEM IS ENCOURAGING PROGRESS

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:38.177 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:40.246 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:41.847 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THE THEORY OF

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:43.516 region:rollup2
ACTION THAT DRIVES WHAT MOST

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.383 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THINK OF AS PERFORMANCE

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.152 region:rollup2
SPACE THROUGHOUT COME SPACE

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:48.120 region:rollup2
FUNDING. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:50.389 region:rollup2
THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.457 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE BETTER INSTITUTIONAL

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:54.260 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:55.261 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE SECOND PART IS

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.996 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT MAKES THE

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.230 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND AND THE

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.965 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT WE THINK MAKE

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.067 region:rollup2
SOUNDS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.735 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL OUTCOME SPACE

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:04.203 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT. MORE LIKE THE

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:05.838 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WE

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:08.607 region:rollup2
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO ALLOCATE

00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:10.376 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARM. BASED

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:11.677 region:rollup2
ON CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDENTS

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.878 region:rollup2
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY FACE

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:14.380 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY HIGH BARRIERS TO

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.381 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.749 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.050 region:rollup2
TO ALLOCATE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:19.518 region:rollup2
PORTION OF OF THE FUNDING BASED

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.953 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:22.221 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT PRINCIPLE THAT WE.

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:23.389 region:rollup2
THINK IS IMPORTANT AND

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.990 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY I THINK THE

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:26.859 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS THINK IS IMPORTANT.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.427 region:rollup2
HAS THAT MOVING FORWARD FUNDING

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:29.528 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE NEED TO BE STABLE AND

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.863 region:rollup2
PREDICTABLE BUT ALSO.

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:33.032 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THEM WITH FLEXIBILITY

00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:33.599 region:rollup2
TO TO MAKE THE KINDS OF CHANGES

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:35.067 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN THIS

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.135 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.436 region:rollup2
THE MEN THAT SECOND BULLET IS

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:38.337 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO HIGHLIGHT I THINK

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.872 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:41.741 region:rollup2
THINKING THROUGH AS WE MOVE

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:43.442 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IS HOW DO

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.210 region:rollup2
THE TYPES OF THE WAYS IN WHICH

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:45.745 region:rollup2
WE DESIGNED A NEW FUNDING

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.346 region:rollup2
FORMULA ALIGNED WITH THE OTHER

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:49.115 region:rollup2
TYPES OF INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:50.883 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.584 region:rollup2
YEARS YOU KNOW GUIDED PATHWAYS

00:20:50.883 --> 00:20:53.152 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:55.554 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY IS THE WAY IN WHICH

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:56.655 region:rollup2
WE SEEK TO. ALLY AND A VARIETY

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.690 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT STUDENT SUCCESS

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.657 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES IN THE COMMUNITY

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.760 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TOGETHER GUIDED

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:02.361 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.429 region:rollup2
UPON A STUDENT CENTURY

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:04.964 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THEIR EDUCATIONAL

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:06.499 region:rollup2
GOAL. PUT THEM ON A PATHWAY

00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:07.466 region:rollup2
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THAT GOAL

00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:08.934 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.602 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEY NEED TO GET BETTER

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.537 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:13.539 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UNDER GUIDED PATHWAYS

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:14.907 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SET OF KEY INDICATORS

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:15.608 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT A

00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:17.776 region:rollup2
MONITOR.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:19.145 region:rollup2
PIECE OR THINGS LIKE A

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.146 region:rollup2
COMPLETION OF TRANSFER LEVEL

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:22.214 region:rollup2
MATH AND ENGLISH IN THE FIRST

00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:24.216 region:rollup2
YEAR AS A WAY IN WHICH WE THINK.

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:26.285 region:rollup2
WE ARE PUTTING STUDENTS ON A

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.920 region:rollup2
BETTER PATH TO SUCCESS WERE

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.687 region:rollup2
WORKING THROUGH THOSE TYPES OF

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.855 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:30.890 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK THROUGH THE FUNDING

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.691 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND SO OBVIOUSLY THAT

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.826 region:rollup2
INCLUDES BASIC SKILLS REFORM BUT

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.860 region:rollup2
IT ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF THE

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:36.495 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING A STRONG

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.397 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:43.936 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TRANSFER OUTCOMES. BUT

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:44.837 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOUT CAREER OUTCOMES.

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:46.338 region:rollup2
SO THE NEXT SLIDE TALKS ABOUT.

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:48.474 region:rollup2
.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:49.775 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:51.043 region:rollup2
HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS PROPOSAL

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:52.812 region:rollup2
SENSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:54.013 region:rollup2
JANUARY BUDGET.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.382 region:rollup2
SO IN JANUARY.

00:21:54.013 --> 00:21:58.384 region:rollup2
WASH ALL ALL BEGIN BY SAYING

00:21:56.382 --> 00:22:00.452 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A STANDING ADVISORY

BUT THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:12.191 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WE HELD A SERIES OF

00:23:10.823 --> 00:23:13.926 region:rollup2
EVENTS FOCUSED ON.

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:15.194 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY IN

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:16.929 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION?

00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:17.830 region:rollup2
AROUND IN THE FUNDING FORMULA

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:19.298 region:rollup2
AND HOW DO WE.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.933 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE OUR GOALS AROUND

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.668 region:rollup2
EQUITY UP THROUGH THIS

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:24.103 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND THAT WE'VE

00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:25.504 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED TO SURVEYS ONE ON

00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:27.706 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FORMULA AND ONE ON

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:29.541 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS TO OUT TO

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:30.576 region:rollup2
GET ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK IN FOR

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:34.113 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE HE RECEIVED.

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:35.814 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF RESPONSES.

00:23:34.113 --> 00:23:37.349 region:rollup2
AND SO IS WORTH BANKING THROUGH

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.751 region:rollup2
OUR NEXT STEPS I THINK WE ARE

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.653 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:42.187 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HEARD OF THE FEEDBACK

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:43.589 region:rollup2
FROM THE LEADERSHIP IN OUR

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:44.523 region:rollup2
OFFICE FROM OUR BOARD OF

00:23:43.589 --> 00:23:45.758 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS. TO MAKE

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:47.059 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEM ABOUT

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:48.627 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE MAY

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:50.062 region:rollup2
REVISION AND SO WE THINK THAT

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:51.463 region:rollup2
THE MAYOR VISION IS A PLACE

00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:53.766 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN BEGIN TO.

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:54.633 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:56.302 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:58.137 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.

00:23:56.302 --> 00:24:00.539 region:rollup2
I TRY TO INCLUDE SOME QUESTIONS

00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:02.007 region:rollup2
HERE THAT REFLECT ADAM SOME OF

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:03.542 region:rollup2
THE WAYS OF SOME OF THE THOUGHTS

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:04.710 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE EMERGED IN SOME OF THE

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:07.046 region:rollup2
WAYS OF ORGANIZING THIS

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:08.213 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. AND SO AGAIN YOU

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:09.214 region:rollup2
KNOW WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:11.016 region:rollup2
THAT THE FORMULA SHOULD

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:12.418 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE ACCESS SUCCESS IN

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:13.686 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:15.454 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOW

00:24:13.686 --> 00:24:16.755 region:rollup2
MUCH EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:18.590 region:rollup2
ON EACH OF THE THREE COMPONENTS

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:19.692 region:rollup2
OF THAT PROPOSAL. AND SO ONE OF

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.260 region:rollup2
THE AREAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:23.429 region:rollup2
FINANCE SUGGESTED WE USE THE

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.763 region:rollup2
SHORTHAND OF ABOUT HALF OF THE

00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:26.699 region:rollup2
MONEY GOING OUT BASED ON ACT.

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:28.233 region:rollup2
BASED ON ENROLLMENT ABOUT A

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:30.369 region:rollup2
QUARTER BASED ON THESE MEASURES

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:32.037 region:rollup2
OF STUDENT NEED AND THE FINAL

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:33.339 region:rollup2
QUARTER BASED ON OUTCOMES. YOU

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:35.374 region:rollup2
KNOW I THINK WE'RE HAVING A

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:36.775 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT BY A WHAT'S

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:38.110 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT BALANCE THERE.

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:39.311 region:rollup2
THE SECOND BULLET ASKS YOU KNOW

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.946 region:rollup2
IN A FUNDING FORMULA THAT

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:42.681 region:rollup2
PROVIDES RESOURCES HAVE FOR

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:44.383 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SPOUSE

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:46.018 region:rollup2
CERTAIN GROUPS OF STUDENTS. WHAT

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:47.586 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT MIGHT WE

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:48.420 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AND I THINK THE

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.988 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.223 region:rollup2
THEIR IS OTHER CHARACTERISTICS

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:53.592 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:54.193 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL NEED? VETERANS

00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:55.227 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:56.762 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:58.864 region:rollup2
OTHER THIRD IS AROUND KIND OF

00:24:56.762 --> 00:25:00.032 region:rollup2
IMPROVED OUTCOMES TO GET OUT OF

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.633 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL USES

00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:02.968 region:rollup2
DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES ARE

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:04.370 region:rollup2
THERE OTHER OUTCOMES

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.804 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY OUTCOMES RELATED TO

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.005 region:rollup2
PROGRESSION THAT WE MIGHT WANT

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:08.707 region:rollup2
TO ALSO CONSIDER IS THE BASIS

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:09.942 region:rollup2
FOR FUNDING.

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:11.477 region:rollup2
A FOURTH OF WITH REGARD TO

00:25:09.942 --> 00:25:13.312 region:rollup2
STABILITY HOW MUCH YEAR OVER

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:14.646 region:rollup2
YEAR CHANGE ARE WE COMFORTABLE

00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:16.081 region:rollup2
IN A DAY FOR FORMULA.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:17.683 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY AS WE

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:19.718 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO A NEW FORMULA WHAT

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:21.787 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME IS APPROPRIATE

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:23.655 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPE OF HOLD HARMLESS TO WE

00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:25.157 region:rollup2
NEED TO A DESIGN WAS THAT LOOK

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.792 region:rollup2
LIKE AND WHAT KIND OF CAPACITY

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:28.260 region:rollup2
DO WE NEED IN THE SHORT TERM.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:28.794 region:rollup2
SO I'M HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH THE

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.262 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH SOME OF THE

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:31.864 region:rollup2
GROUPS.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:32.831 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVE TALKED TO THAT.

00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:34.900 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:36.402 region:rollup2
HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.770 region:rollup2
SO JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE YOU KNOW

00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:39.238 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU KNOW.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.440 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO BE

00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:43.742 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF IS THAT A NEW FORMULA

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.310 region:rollup2
DE IN OUR MIND IS INTENDED TO

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:47.379 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE CHANGES THE OTHER

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.680 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES AND SO. WE NEED TO

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.115 region:rollup2
THINK THROUGH HOW WE ARE CHOOSE

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.817 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT THIS.

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:53.218 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY CHANGES IN STATUTE

00:25:51.817 --> 00:25:54.653 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:56.388 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS POLICIES THAT OUR

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:57.790 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT SYSTEMS. AND THEN

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:59.291 region:rollup2
REQUIRE US TO COMMUNICATE THOSE

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.325 region:rollup2
WITH OUR COLLEGES BUT I THINK

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:02.828 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE THINK

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:03.762 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:04.963 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING THE

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:06.999 region:rollup2
TYPE OF CAPACITY BUILDING THAT

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:08.634 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO ENCOURAGE

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:09.902 region:rollup2
A COLLEGE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:11.503 region:rollup2
OF THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE

00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:13.138 region:rollup2
CREATED IN THE NEW SYSTEM.

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:14.907 region:rollup2
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE MAKING

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:16.408 region:rollup2
A SET OF HYPOTHESES THAT THESE

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.043 region:rollup2
TYPES OF POLICY CHANGES WILL

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:19.211 region:rollup2
RESULT IN IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:20.913 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE

00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:22.281 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THE FACTS OF THOSE IN

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:22.781 region:rollup2
THE COMING YEARS. AND MAKE

00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:24.183 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS AND SO THAT

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:26.151 region:rollup2
INCLUDES.

00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:27.886 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN COMING

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:29.555 region:rollup2
YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WERE

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:31.290 region:rollup2
FIND THE FORMULA. TO DO WHAT WE

00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:31.924 region:rollup2
WANTED STIFF.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.192 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.627 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:37.529 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:38.497 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:40.699 region:rollup2
TAKING THE ROLE TODAY THIS IS A

00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:41.967 region:rollup2
JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:43.635 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AND KNOW TO THE TO THE

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.971 region:rollup2

AGAIN AT THAT AT THE END WE

00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:52.377 region:rollup2
WILL.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.847 region:rollup2
WE WILL.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:56.248 region:rollup2
OBLIGED FIRST WILL START WITH

00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:58.417 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:26:56.248 --> 00:27:00.586 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS OUT OF A FEW

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:01.954 region:rollup2
BUT OPENED UP TO. MY OTHER

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:04.890 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

AND IT WAS THE INTENT OF OF THE

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:14.500 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.904 region:rollup2
AND THAT MAY BE GIVE THE

00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:20.873 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PERMANENT

00:27:18.904 --> 00:27:22.574 region:rollup2
FINANCED IT TO CLARIFY. THAT

00:27:20.873 --> 00:27:24.042 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SMALLER CATEGORICAL

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:26.111 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.181 region:rollup2
THE.

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:31.316 region:rollup2
HE AT THAT POINT DAY AND NAY

00:27:29.181 --> 00:27:32.784 region:rollup2
SAYER PIANISSIMO JOB THAT WE

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:34.753 region:rollup2
WERE NOT CAN YOU DID DISABILITY

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:36.488 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WE WERE NOT CONSIDERING

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:37.322 region:rollup2
THOSE TO BE PART OF THIS FUNDING

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.856 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.191 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS IS THAT IS THAT

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:41.326 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:43.462 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS SO

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:44.730 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND TERMS OF

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:46.098 region:rollup2
AT CHANGING THE FUNDING FORMULA

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.399 region:rollup2
APPLIES ONLY TO GENERAL PURPOSE

00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.201 region:rollup2
PORTION MEN'S. WHAT THE

MORE FLEXIBILITY AS WE DON'T

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.212 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY AT AT THIS POINT WE'RE

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:01.313 region:rollup2
NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC

00:28:00.212 --> 00:28:02.581 region:rollup2
CATEGORIC WAS YOU WANNA HEAR

00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:04.016 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK FAIR CHANCE HIS OFFICE

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.350 region:rollup2
MAYBE COMMITTEE COLLEGES CAN

00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:08.453 region:rollup2
CLARIFY BUT AS WHEN I. MAKE SURE

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.521 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT WE SO FAR

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:10.455 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.323 region:rollup2
THE IN ITS COLLECTIVE INTENT

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:13.058 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT

00:28:11.323 --> 00:28:14.560 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THAT'S NOT PART OF THE

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.361 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION MEAN LOOKING AT THE

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.063 region:rollup2
THREE BIG POTS OF MAYBE YES SO I

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:19.831 region:rollup2
THINK YOU KNOW. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:22.067 region:rollup2
REQUEST WAS LOOK AT CATEGORICAL

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:24.369 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:26.104 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS BUT THOSE ARE PLACES

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:28.507 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD LOOK. OUT TO YOUR

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.074 region:rollup2
POINT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE

00:28:28.507 --> 00:28:30.709 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:32.110 region:rollup2
SUCCESS IN SUPPORT PROGRAM THE

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.345 region:rollup2
STUDENT EQUITY PROGRAM AND THE

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.046 region:rollup2
BASIC SKILLS INITIATIVE WHICH

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.614 region:rollup2
ARE SIZE WILL.

00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:38.216 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT WE THINK.

00:28:35.614 --> 00:28:41.219 region:rollup2
WE CAN CHANGE INCENTIVES THERE.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:42.955 region:rollup2
THERE AND AND THAT BE THE THAT

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.755 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE SEND

00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:45.157 region:rollup2
OUR THE RECOMMENDATION WE SEND

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:47.392 region:rollup2
BACK WITH PART OF FINANCES I

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:48.994 region:rollup2
THINK THE MESSAGE GOT NOW. WE

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:50.395 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE DOZENS OF THEM.

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:52.798 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE AND TWENTY STUDENTS IN

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:53.699 region:rollup2
THE AUDIENCE HERE TODAY SO. I

00:28:52.798 --> 00:28:55.634 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER ONE IN THE NUMBER

00:28:53.699 --> 00:28:57.135 region:rollup2
TWO I I DO ASSUME THAT YOU'RE

00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:58.637 region:rollup2
TAKING THIS COLLECTIVE FEEDBACK

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:00.072 region:rollup2
IN THE NAY REVISION YOU'LL TAKE

00:28:58.637 --> 00:29:01.440 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION

00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:05.377 region:rollup2
WITH THAT REVISION FOR THE. WITH

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.012 region:rollup2
THAT REVISED PROPOSAL FOR THIS.

00:29:05.377 --> 00:29:08.947 region:rollup2
SO I CAN SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY ON

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:09.581 region:rollup2
A WELL ONLY NOW BEING HEARD AND.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:10.415 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW INCLUDE IN THE IN THE

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:12.618 region:rollup2
MAYOR VISION BUT WE ARE

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.785 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ENGAGING THEM WITH

00:29:12.618 --> 00:29:15.921 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE RECEIVING

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:16.855 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK ARE DEATHLY TAKING THAT

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:20.025 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION.

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:21.793 region:rollup2
OKAY. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE ON.

00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:23.462 region:rollup2
THE HOLD HARMLESS ISSUE I KNOW

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:25.631 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD FROM A FEW COMMUNITY

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:25.831 region:rollup2
COLLEGES NOT JUST.

00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:27.399 region:rollup2
AND.

00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:30.969 region:rollup2
IN IN MY DISTRICT UT FROM

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:31.436 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE AND. AND I I

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:33.105 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:35.307 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE OUGHT

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:36.742 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE DID

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:38.577 region:rollup2
WITH LCF F..

00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:39.978 region:rollup2
THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY PICK

00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:41.513 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS SOME MAY SAY

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:42.047 region:rollup2
NO WE'RE HAVING DEBATES IN K.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:43.081 region:rollup2
TWELVE THAT THERE ARE THAT

00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:44.716 region:rollup2
BITES.

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:46.818 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AS WE GROW GOING

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:48.620 region:rollup2
FORWARD THE NEW REVENUES NOT

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:50.722 region:rollup2
AFTER ONE OR TWO YEARS.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.523 region:rollup2
TO TEN SEE RE BAD SHOULD HAVE

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:52.991 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS TAKEN A

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:54.860 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:55.127 region:rollup2
I HAD SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.260 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:57.295 region:rollup2
.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.997 region:rollup2
.

00:29:57.295 --> 00:30:00.932 region:rollup2
TO TO ME I THINK TO TO TO PICK

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:02.467 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE SO FAR SIDES WANNA

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.536 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE WE HAVE THAT.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:07.139 region:rollup2
ON THE RECORD. AND THEN.

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:10.008 region:rollup2
AT AND THEN AT SO I THINK THE

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:10.309 region:rollup2
DEBATE IS WE KNOW WHAT WHAT

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:12.244 region:rollup2
BUCKETS OF.

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:12.811 region:rollup2
.

00:30:12.244 --> 00:30:15.347 region:rollup2
AB ANYWAY TALKING ABOUT THE

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:17.249 region:rollup2
GENERAL. KIND IT IMPORT CEMENT

00:30:15.347 --> 00:30:18.483 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IN THE COMPARISON TRADE

00:30:17.249 --> 00:30:20.686 region:rollup2
LIKE K. TWELVE.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:23.055 region:rollup2
JUST MEAN UPPER PEOPLE.

00:30:20.686 --> 00:30:25.724 region:rollup2
AND THEN LOOKING AT SOME TAPPED

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:27.793 region:rollup2
A DEMOGRAPHIC. CHARACTERISTICS

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:29.027 region:rollup2
INCOME AND THEN THE ARM AND THE.

00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:30.829 region:rollup2
.

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:33.332 region:rollup2
.

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:35.167 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME SPEAKS AND SO I KNOW

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:36.435 region:rollup2
THAT TWO CRITICISMS HAVE COME UP

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:38.103 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS I WANT TO

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:38.670 region:rollup2
GIVE BACK COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:39.838 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TO

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.506 region:rollup2
RESPOND.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.108 region:rollup2
AND TO THOSE AND SO AS FAR AS

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.776 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES BASED.

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:46.645 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:47.846 region:rollup2
CRITICISMS IS THAT.

00:30:46.645 --> 00:30:50.182 region:rollup2
IT WOULD JUST IT WOULD

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:51.817 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BE AT M. ANALOGOUS

00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:53.318 region:rollup2
TO WHAT HAPPENS IN K. TWELVE AND

00:30:51.817 --> 00:30:54.453 region:rollup2
TESTING THAT.

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.053 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:30:54.453 --> 00:30:56.388 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOUR REWARD SCHOOLS

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:57.656 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:59.291 region:rollup2
TESTING AND NOT TEACHING AND

00:30:57.656 --> 00:31:01.259 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE IS DIFFERENT TACK

00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:02.761 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IN THOSE.

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:04.129 region:rollup2
THOSE I ON OUTCOMES ARE OUT OF

00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:05.163 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETIMES OUT OF THE REACH

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:06.865 region:rollup2
OF THE PEOPLE TO TEACH A

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:09.267 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM AND SO I'M YOU KNOW WE

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:10.902 region:rollup2
DON'T ALWAYS. PAY TEACHERS BY

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:12.104 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE AND HOW THEY'RE YOU

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:13.505 region:rollup2
KNOW THE OUTCOMES OF OF THE

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:15.440 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:31:13.505 --> 00:31:17.943 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN TO IT IF YOU HAD

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.711 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF FORMULA BASED UPON.

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:21.813 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:23.682 region:rollup2
COM YOU KNOW WOULD IT BE A

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:24.282 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:25.584 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE BEST

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:26.718 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:28.720 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE IS A HIGH

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:30.255 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING SCHOOL THAT HAS

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.490 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS TRANSFER RATES AND.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:32.824 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.392 region:rollup2
HOW ARE THEY GONNA BE REWARDED

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.861 region:rollup2
WITH THE WHOLE NOTION OF THIS IS

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.963 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO GIVE RESOURCES TO THE

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:39.731 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS. HAS STUDENTS WHO NEED

00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:41.266 region:rollup2
THE MOST HELP SELL.

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.401 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU CAN START OFF BY

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:45.604 region:rollup2
RESPONDING TO IT TO TO HAVE THAT

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:48.006 region:rollup2
OF THE CRITICISMS AS FAR AS.

00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:49.341 region:rollup2
THE AT IMPLEMENTATION.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:52.444 region:rollup2
SURE SO.

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:53.879 region:rollup2
ON THE CONCERNS ABOUT ALL OUT

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:55.046 region:rollup2
QUALITY I THINK AS AND THAT LEO

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:56.281 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:58.150 region:rollup2
ME OF THE RESEARCH IS

00:31:56.281 --> 00:32:00.986 region:rollup2
INCONCLUSIVE ON WHETHER OUT

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.621 region:rollup2
QUALITY ADD DECREASES AND.

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.555 region:rollup2
IT IN INSTANCES WHERE

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:04.689 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE SPACE OUT BECAUSE

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:06.191 region:rollup2
HE'S FUNNY MODELS HAVE BEEN

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:07.559 region:rollup2
ADOPTED SO THERE'S STRONG

00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:09.461 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT FACULTY WILL NOT

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:11.196 region:rollup2
LOWER STANDARDS I THINK ONE OF

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:13.331 region:rollup2
THE. CONCERNS HAS BEEN BROUGHT

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:14.733 region:rollup2
UP IS SAYS INCREASE OF

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.934 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES A SHORT TERM

00:32:14.733 --> 00:32:17.702 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES IN THE FUNNY MODEL

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:19.271 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:20.672 region:rollup2
THERE. TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONTINUES TO

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:25.210 region:rollup2
MONITOR AND.

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:27.179 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP STANDARDS FOR THE AT

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.713 region:rollup2
METRICS ARE COUNTED AS PART OF

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:30.582 region:rollup2
THE OF THE FUNDING FORMULA WE

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:32.350 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TAKING FEEDBACK ON YOU

00:32:30.582 --> 00:32:34.019 region:rollup2
KNOW THINKING THROUGH THOSE.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.455 region:rollup2
POLITY ISSUES.

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:38.623 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SORT OF A FUNDING

00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:40.926 region:rollup2
FORMULA PENALIZING AT COMMUNITY

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:42.894 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THAT THAT SERVE LOW

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:44.463 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS. I THINK THE KEY

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:46.565 region:rollup2
IS REALLY FINDING THAT BALANCE I

00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:49.601 region:rollup2
THINK WE WANNA HAVE A STRONG

00:32:46.565 --> 00:32:51.169 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF RESOURCES TO THOSE

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:53.171 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT SERVED AND

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.872 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SO WE

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:55.907 region:rollup2
CRAFTED.

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:57.209 region:rollup2
A FORMULA THAT TRAVIS TRIES TO

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:59.744 region:rollup2
STRIKE THAT BALANCE THAT IT'S

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.779 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO DRECK RESOURCES TO

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:02.113 region:rollup2
THOSE COLLEGES THAT'S HURDLES

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:05.183 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS BUT IT'S ALSO

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:06.017 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO CREATE THE

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.619 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES.

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:09.020 region:rollup2
TO TO FURTHER.

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:09.955 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.523 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING.

00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:13.492 region:rollup2
AT THE COLLEGES SO WE'RE

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.993 region:rollup2
DEATHLY THINKING THROUGH THAT

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:16.728 region:rollup2
BALANCE AND ONE OF THE. COMET

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:18.396 region:rollup2
PIECES OF FEEDBACK HAS BEEN IS

00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:19.764 region:rollup2
OUR WAY TO BETTER INCORPORATE

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:21.366 region:rollup2
EQUITY INTO THE STUDENT SUCCESS

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:23.602 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRANT TO WE ARE TAKING

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:25.370 region:rollup2
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS PART

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:27.239 region:rollup2
OF THIS A LARGER RESPONSE TO HOW

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.106 region:rollup2
DO WE ENSURE. THAT THE DISTRICTS

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:30.375 region:rollup2
A SERB.

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:31.710 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:33.512 region:rollup2
RECEIVING IN THE RESOURCES AND

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.447 region:rollup2
ARE BEING REWARDED FOR.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:37.148 region:rollup2
IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR THOSE

00:33:35.447 --> 00:33:38.783 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:40.886 region:rollup2
AND DAD CAN YOU GO BACK TO THE

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:43.054 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT I RAISED EARLIER

00:33:40.886 --> 00:33:45.056 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE. DISTRICTS CONCERNED

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:46.057 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:48.126 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD THE NEW ENGLAND

00:33:46.057 --> 00:33:50.662 region:rollup2
HOLDING HARMLESS.

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:52.330 region:rollup2
I'M OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM.

00:33:50.662 --> 00:33:53.565 region:rollup2
I SURE SO IT THINK THAT'S

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.933 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:55.901 region:rollup2
BEEN YOU KNOW HEARING FEEDBACK

00:33:54.933 --> 00:33:58.503 region:rollup2
ON.

00:33:55.901 --> 00:34:00.405 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THERE'S THERE'S AN

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:01.606 region:rollup2
ONGOING HOLD HARMLESS THAT WE

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:03.308 region:rollup2
PROPOSE AND THERE'S.

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:05.343 region:rollup2
IN US THERE'S VARIOUS

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:06.811 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS TO THAT BUT I'M IN

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:08.413 region:rollup2
THINKING THROUGH THE TRANSITION

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:10.849 region:rollup2
TO THE NEW FORMULA WE THINK THAT

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:11.983 region:rollup2
AS FEES RATES INCREASE THAT

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:12.517 region:rollup2
THOSE DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.518 region:rollup2
HELD HARMLESS IN THE FIRST

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:15.020 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:17.222 region:rollup2
WOULD QUICKLY TRANSITION INTO.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.189 region:rollup2
AT THE NEW FORMULA THAT THAT

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:19.791 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:21.426 region:rollup2
DEATHLY LOOKING INTO THAT

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:23.695 region:rollup2
TRANSITION PERIOD BUT OF THE

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:25.897 region:rollup2
GOAL IS REALLY TO HAVE DISTRICTS

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:27.766 region:rollup2
MOVED TO THE CITY A FUNDING

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:29.467 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND YOU ALLOCATION. AWAY

00:34:27.766 --> 00:34:30.902 region:rollup2
FROM THE HOLD HARMLESS SO THAT

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:33.238 region:rollup2
BE JUST THROUGH THAT FIRST

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:34.205 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS OF A TRANSITION AND

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.840 region:rollup2
THEN YOU WOULD RIVER.

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:38.343 region:rollup2
TO THAT TO THE NEW FORMULA

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.677 region:rollup2
POURED. ALL GOING FORWARD NEW

00:34:38.343 --> 00:34:41.880 region:rollup2
MONEY SOAK.

00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:44.015 region:rollup2
NEW MONEY WOULD BE PART OF THAT

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.383 region:rollup2
NEW FORMULA AT THE HOLD HARMLESS

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:46.584 region:rollup2
IS AN ON GOING HOME HOLD

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:48.386 region:rollup2
HARMLESS THAT IS TIED TO

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:51.923 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN.

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:53.858 region:rollup2
PURSUED AND RATES.

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:55.260 region:rollup2
IF I'D JUST ON THE OUTCOMES PART

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:55.994 region:rollup2
OF THIS SITE I DO WANT TO SEE

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.862 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK.

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:59.297 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:01.333 region:rollup2
HAVING A CERTAIN ABOUT HOW DO WE

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:02.968 region:rollup2
STRIKE A BALANCE ACROSS A

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:05.003 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT VALUES. I

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:06.438 region:rollup2
THINK THE POINT OF THE VISION

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:08.440 region:rollup2
FOR SUCCESS OR ONE OF THE.

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:09.941 region:rollup2
KEY PARTS OF THE VISION FOR

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.042 region:rollup2
SUCCESS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.644 region:rollup2
THAT OUR OUTCOMES TODAY ARE

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:15.347 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE

00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:16.915 region:rollup2
SO I THINK. A GREATER EMPHASIS

00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:18.550 region:rollup2
ON OUTCOMES IN OUR MIND IT I

00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:19.951 region:rollup2
THINK IS A WELCOME PART OF THIS

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.052 region:rollup2
FORMULA WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.787 region:rollup2
.

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:24.089 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS THE METAPHOR.

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:27.559 region:rollup2
FOLKS OFTEN USES.

00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:29.294 region:rollup2
MOVING FROM A CAFETERIA STYLE.

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:32.097 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:33.898 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PRIMARY VALUE IS ON

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:35.266 region:rollup2
BROAD ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:37.502 region:rollup2
COURSES.

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:39.637 region:rollup2
SHIFTING INTO A MORE FOCUS

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:40.705 region:rollup2
PATHWAY WHERE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.240 region:rollup2
OR ARE ASKED WHAT THEIR

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:43.475 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL GOALS ARE AND ARE

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.642 region:rollup2
GIVEN A DIRECTION.

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.077 region:rollup2
TO GET THERE AND SO I THINK.

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:47.579 region:rollup2
.

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:49.180 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE WILL NEED

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:49.848 region:rollup2
TO SEE IF A.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.649 region:rollup2
PUTTING THIS IN A FUNDING

00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:53.318 region:rollup2
FORMULA TAKES US

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:55.387 region:rollup2
FAR LEADS TO.

00:35:53.318 --> 00:35:55.987 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT I

00:35:55.387 --> 00:35:58.556 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:36:01.526 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS.

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:02.527 region:rollup2
ALL WHINING OUR FUNDING SYSTEM

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:03.094 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXPECTATIONS WE'VE SET

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.829 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:08.400 region:rollup2
TO THE POINT ABOUT.

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:09.167 region:rollup2
ACCESS FOR ON YOU KNOW STUDENTS

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.402 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.870 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED OR WHOSE

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:14.372 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS SUGGEST THAT.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.240 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HARDER

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.107 region:rollup2
TIME MEETING THE OUTCOMES THAT

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.842 region:rollup2
WE.

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:19.244 region:rollup2
INCLUDING A FORMULA YOU KNOW I

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:21.012 region:rollup2
THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:22.514 region:rollup2
NOTED THAT ONE WAY YOU CAN

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.748 region:rollup2
DESIGN A FORMULA AND IN A PLACE

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.949 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:26.251 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE IN OTHER

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:28.086 region:rollup2
STATES THAT THIS HELPS TO

00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:30.488 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS. IS BY.

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:32.257 region:rollup2
INCLUDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.857 region:rollup2
FOR THE OUTCOMES ATTRIBUTABLE TO

00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:35.226 region:rollup2
CERTAIN GROUPS AND SO LOOKING

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:37.529 region:rollup2
AT.

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:39.064 region:rollup2
DEGREES EARNED A BY LOW INCOME

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:40.498 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S A OR

00:36:39.064 --> 00:36:41.766 region:rollup2
SOMETHING REASONABLE AND AND

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.267 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BE

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:47.572 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:49.007 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY.

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:50.542 region:rollup2
WELL I WOULDA I WAS GONNA

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:51.543 region:rollup2
IMPLIED THAT THAT ISSUE ABOUT

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.278 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES OF THE GREAT NOW

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:54.579 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HIM LIKE THAT THAT THE

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.880 region:rollup2
DATA RUN THAT THAT THE

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.382 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCED PRODUCED.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.683 region:rollup2
YOU LOOKING AT OUTCOMES THAT ARE

00:36:57.382 --> 00:36:59.517 region:rollup2
NOT CONTROLLING FOR THE

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.052 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS I THINK ONCE

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:03.354 region:rollup2
YOU'VE. DESIGNED A SYSTEM THAT

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:05.056 region:rollup2
DOES THAT I THINK YOU YOU THE.

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.625 region:rollup2
YEAR LOW UNIT YOU ELIMINATE THE

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:09.294 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF SERVE PENALIZING.

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:10.595 region:rollup2
GOT DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OUR

00:37:09.294 --> 00:37:11.629 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT ARE HARDER TO

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.764 region:rollup2
SERVE SO WE THINK THAT THE ONE.

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:14.699 region:rollup2
KEY WAY THAT YOU COULDN'T

00:37:12.764 --> 00:37:16.568 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT COMPONENT. ON ON ON

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:17.569 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE ARE MUCH OF THE GETS

00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:18.903 region:rollup2
ITS ACT.

00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:20.805 region:rollup2
IF THE CHALLENGING ISSUE ON THE

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:23.374 region:rollup2
ONE HAND YOU WANT TO PROVIDE

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:25.110 region:rollup2
SOME STABILITY FOR. A NURSE FOR

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND COMMITTEE BECAUSE

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.479 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS OF THE TRANSITIONING

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:29.614 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME EVENTUALLY YOU

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:30.215 region:rollup2
DO WANT THIS TO MATTER BECAUSE

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:31.516 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THE

00:37:30.215 --> 00:37:33.485 region:rollup2
FORMULA FOR BOTH TO CREATE AN

00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:35.019 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE. DIRECTED TO CHANGE

00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:36.054 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND SO I THINK THAT FOR

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:36.921 region:rollup2
A DIFFICULT TRADE OFF AND KIND

00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:37.655 region:rollup2
OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.524 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:41.292 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SOME STABILITY WHAT

00:37:39.524 --> 00:37:43.261 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT THE

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:45.330 region:rollup2
THE FORMULA ITSELF. HAVE AN

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:48.633 region:rollup2
EFFECT I'M I'M ON BOOK COLLEGES

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:56.407 region:rollup2
RECEIVE.

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:57.809 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAVEZ.

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.943 region:rollup2
I'M A VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.311 region:rollup2
WHOLE EFFORT WE'RE DOING HERE I

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:02.046 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S.

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:03.748 region:rollup2
THE LA TIMES STUDY LOOKING AT IT

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:04.916 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO.

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:07.719 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:08.686 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:09.587 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:11.389 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THE COMMUNITY

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:12.557 region:rollup2
COLLEGES FARMS HOW MANY STUDENTS

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:14.959 region:rollup2
WHO ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED IS USE

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:15.360 region:rollup2
YOUR USUALLY.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.995 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.063 region:rollup2
.

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:20.665 region:rollup2
WHO?

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.633 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CAFETERIA MODEL YOU

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:23.101 region:rollup2
LAID OUT IS PROBABLY APPROPRIATE

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:24.702 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE TAKE A LOT OF THINGS

00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:25.737 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KIND OF WONDER AND FOR

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:28.439 region:rollup2
WHAT AND TO WHAT END.

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:29.174 region:rollup2
.

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:31.943 region:rollup2
MAKES YOU THINK BACK WHEN I

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:32.710 region:rollup2
WOULD TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE.

00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:35.146 region:rollup2
BEFORE I BECAME A COMMITTEE

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.481 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WAS VERY SH SCRIPTED

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.749 region:rollup2
WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD GO

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:39.951 region:rollup2
THERE AND YOU WERE GOING TO

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:42.387 region:rollup2
TRANSFER TO A. SERIOUS YOU GET A

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:43.655 region:rollup2
PATHWAY HE HAS VERY CLEAR LOT A

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:44.222 region:rollup2
COUNSELING.

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:44.689 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE I THINK WE GOT OFF

00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:47.859 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
.

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:51.062 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED THAT DID. THAT THE

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.932 region:rollup2
CURRENT MODEL DISCOURAGES

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:57.302 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

00:38:53.932 --> 00:38:59.838 region:rollup2
THAT THE ECONOMICS OF THE STATE.

00:38:57.302 --> 00:39:02.607 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE OF ROBUST ECONOMY

00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:03.041 region:rollup2
THE AROMA DROPS WE HAVE MORE

00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:04.275 region:rollup2
MONEY BUT WE HAVE.

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:06.144 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING ECONOMY WITH PEOPLE

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:07.879 region:rollup2
TRYING TO RETRAIN.

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:08.980 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A DROP IN THE MONEY AND

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:10.481 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY MORE PEOPLE THERE.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.450 region:rollup2
SO THIS SHOULD.

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:13.952 region:rollup2
COULD ADDRESS IT.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.988 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:17.622 region:rollup2
WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE GOAL OF THE

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:19.457 region:rollup2
STATE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:22.227 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND THAT WAS. EDUCATION.

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:24.262 region:rollup2
ARE PREPARED FOR WORKFORCE.

00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:25.129 region:rollup2
I THINK DOES A REALLY GOOD

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:26.464 region:rollup2
POINT SOME WHY WE NEED TO DO

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:28.933 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:30.768 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:32.437 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS HERE.

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:34.305 region:rollup2
NOW AND. I DON'T THINK I HEARD A

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:35.974 region:rollup2
LOT OF DISCUSSION OR MAYBE YOU

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:37.976 region:rollup2
COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT.

00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:39.744 region:rollup2
THE RURAL COMMUNITIES.

00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:41.246 region:rollup2
I MAY LOSE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING I

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:43.881 region:rollup2
HAVE A QUESTION HERE.

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:44.949 region:rollup2
HOW DOESTHE ADMINISTRATION PLAN?

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:47.685 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF WORLD

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:49.120 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:51.422 region:rollup2
THEY EXPRESSED THAT THEY'RE

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE RELEASING FUNDING.

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.425 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.993 region:rollup2
RURAL KING COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:57.862 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:59.230 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:40:00.531 region:rollup2
CHRIS FORGET SOME OF FINANCE SO

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.466 region:rollup2
CERTAIN WE WE'VE HEARD THOSE

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:03.268 region:rollup2
SAME CONCERNS.

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:05.069 region:rollup2
CHAU AS WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:06.804 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS AND FEEDBACK

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.805 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:09.674 region:rollup2
WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT INTO

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:11.509 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION I THINK ONE OF THE

00:40:09.674 --> 00:40:13.244 region:rollup2
MOST COMMON ELEMENTS THAT WE'VE

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:14.946 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM WORLD COLLEGES TO

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:16.881 region:rollup2
CONSIDER. IF THERE'S A

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:18.583 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR COMPONENT UP REFERRED

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:20.685 region:rollup2
TO AS THE BASE ALLOCATION IN THE

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:22.687 region:rollup2
FORMULA. AND IF THAT.

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:24.522 region:rollup2
USING THE RIGHT BANDS AND THE

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:26.991 region:rollup2
RIGHT WAITS TO CAPTURE SOME OF

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.925 region:rollup2
THOSE BASIC NECESSITIES THAT AT

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:29.027 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF COLLEGES.

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:30.395 region:rollup2
I'M SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

00:40:29.027 --> 00:40:31.029 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HEARD FROM DISTRICTS

00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:31.629 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT WERE

00:40:31.029 --> 00:40:34.699 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:36.634 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING AND LOOKING UP.

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:37.802 region:rollup2
IT.

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:39.437 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.872 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK OFTEN WHEN WE

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:42.206 region:rollup2
ARE CONSIDERING HER BECAUSE

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:43.207 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:44.809 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF CONSIDERING A NEW

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.344 region:rollup2
FORMULA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.946 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVE WHAT WE HAVE IN

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:50.982 region:rollup2
PLACE TODAY BUT I THINK.

00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:53.184 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:55.219 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITY SPACE ARE OFTEN

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:56.454 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES HAVE. YOU KNOW.

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:58.656 region:rollup2
.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:59.991 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT ECONOMIES OF SCALE

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:01.292 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK ARE SIMILAR

00:40:59.991 --> 00:41:03.728 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND AND ENROLLMENT

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:05.163 region:rollup2
FUNDING SYSTEM AND I THINK YOU

00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:06.364 region:rollup2
CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW. A

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:08.733 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES MIGHT

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:10.368 region:rollup2
BE ALLEVIATED IN A SYSTEM THAT

00:41:08.733 --> 00:41:12.070 region:rollup2
ISN'T SO BASED ON C. TIME BUT IS

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:14.405 region:rollup2
BASED ON KINDS OF THE TYPES OF

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.974 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES. AND IN SOME CASES HERE

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:17.475 region:rollup2
I THINK DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

00:41:15.974 --> 00:41:18.776 region:rollup2
DEFINE WHICH STUDENT GROUPS.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:20.845 region:rollup2
ARE IMPORTANT TO.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:21.646 region:rollup2
TARGETING A FORMULA I THINK YOU

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:23.047 region:rollup2
CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:23.548 region:rollup2
CONCERNS TO SO I THINK THIS IS.

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:25.049 region:rollup2
.

00:41:23.548 --> 00:41:27.452 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:27.819 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD ALSO

00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:28.853 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:30.655 region:rollup2
TAKEN YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:32.090 region:rollup2
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BUT I DON'T

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.591 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD FUNDAMENTAL

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY IMAGINE THAT RURAL

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:36.594 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:38.229 region:rollup2
WOULD DO WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:39.097 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THEM IN AN INFORMAL

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.498 region:rollup2
I THINK IN MANY WAYS.

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:42.200 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN

00:41:40.498 --> 00:41:44.202 region:rollup2
DESIGN BENEFITS THAT ARE BETTER

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.736 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:45.536 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR SOME OF THESE

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:49.240 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPE OF BENEFITS?

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.575 region:rollup2
WE THINK SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.410 region:rollup2
TWO COMPONENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:41:50.575 --> 00:41:53.911 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS ARE YOU KNOW THE

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.279 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THIS THAT THE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.513 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION CALLS A BASE

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:56.681 region:rollup2
GRANT.

00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:58.116 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS.

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:59.917 region:rollup2
FINANCE SUGGESTED.

00:41:58.116 --> 00:42:01.619 region:rollup2
THAT IS A COMBINATION OF PER

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:03.788 region:rollup2
FTE YES FUNDING AND.

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:05.123 region:rollup2
PER COLLEGE PER DISTRICT

00:42:03.788 --> 00:42:07.392 region:rollup2
FUNDING SO I THINK.

00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:08.860 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT WHAT THE RELATIVE

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:09.961 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THOSE TWO PARTS OF THAT

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.529 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ARE IMPORTANT COME.

00:42:09.961 --> 00:42:12.597 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I THINK AS WE

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:14.265 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:42:12.597 --> 00:42:15.266 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THIS THEN IT'S HOW DO

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:16.534 region:rollup2
YOU DEFINE.

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:18.403 region:rollup2
WHICH STUDENTS WERE TARGETING

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.570 region:rollup2
IN THE FORMULA AND I THINK ON

00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:21.439 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME SIDE OF THIS.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:23.141 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:24.876 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS IS LOOKING AT WHAT

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:26.144 region:rollup2
IS THE RATIO OF THE COLLEGES

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:27.979 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES TO ITS.

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:30.681 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT AND HOW DO WE YOU

00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:31.749 region:rollup2
KNOW IN SOME CASES I'M CERTAIN.

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:33.985 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN OUTCOMES THAT WE

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:36.788 region:rollup2
CHOOSE OUR MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE

00:42:33.985 --> 00:42:37.355 region:rollup2
SENSE I MAKE MORE SENSE AND.

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:40.291 region:rollup2
CONNECT CONTEXT COMPARED TO

00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:41.626 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:43.361 region:rollup2
NOT JUST MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW

00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:46.030 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:47.799 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU SEE. A REAL ECONOMIC

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.332 region:rollup2
ENGINES IN A COMMUNITY AND MANY

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:50.468 region:rollup2
TIMES IN THERE AND A RURAL

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:52.603 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:53.938 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE. IN THOSE LOWER

00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:55.840 region:rollup2
COST OF LIVING THEY OFTEN HAVE.

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:57.775 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING FOR JOBS AND THINGS

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.510 region:rollup2
SO. I JUST HAVE THAT CONCERNED

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:01.345 region:rollup2
ON THE ROAD COLLEGES.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.780 region:rollup2
I'M NOT THE LA GO THEY HAVE THIS

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:04.148 region:rollup2
LAST BULLET HERE MONITOR

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.583 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION DETERMINE IF

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:08.920 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES.

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:10.588 region:rollup2
EMERGE HOW DO YOU SEE THAT.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.823 region:rollup2
WHEN WILL YOU START SAY IN. HOW

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:13.391 region:rollup2
DID YOU GUYS CAN BE REPORTED

00:43:11.823 --> 00:43:15.326 region:rollup2
BACK TO US ON THE IMPACT OF THIS

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:16.861 region:rollup2
DECISION?

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:17.361 region:rollup2
WHAT BINGO A LOT OF THE THE

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:18.663 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WE ARE

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.997 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THE CHAPTERS OFFICE

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:20.264 region:rollup2
ALREADY COLLECT THAT INFORMATION

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.100 region:rollup2
AND AND?

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:23.734 region:rollup2
HAS IT AVAILABLE WHAT'S MORE

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.169 region:rollup2
ABOUT MINORING OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:26.237 region:rollup2
YEARS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.738 region:rollup2
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE

00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:28.806 region:rollup2
DEPARTING RELEASED A FEW YEARS

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.807 region:rollup2
OF INFORMATION. TO COME TO GET A

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:31.576 region:rollup2
SENSE OF THERE'S A TREND GOING

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:33.211 region:rollup2
ON BUT I THINK IT'S JUST LOOKING

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:34.879 region:rollup2
AT THINGS LIKE ARE WE SEEING OF

00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:36.314 region:rollup2
THIS CONCERN ABOUT SHIFTING TO

00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:37.348 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES ARE WE

00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:39.117 region:rollup2
SEEING THEIR THE SYSTEM AS A

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.618 region:rollup2
WHOLE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT

00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:41.719 region:rollup2
OVEREMPHASIS ON THAT OR A

00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:43.154 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ON THAT

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.556 region:rollup2
VERSUS OTHER. OTHER.

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:47.291 region:rollup2
AT DEGREES OR CERTIFICATES DO

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:48.159 region:rollup2
WE SEE OUR DIFFERENCES IN

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:51.095 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOR THE GROUND WITH

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:51.829 region:rollup2
WITH DIFFERENT UP PARTICULAR

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
STUDENT GROUPS.

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.965 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IT'S NOW OF

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.266 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK YOU'RE

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.400 region:rollup2
GONNA SAY FIND THE THE EXACT

00:43:55.266 --> 00:43:57.768 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OF YUGOSLAVIA BUT

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.436 region:rollup2
MONITORING THAT DATA CAN HELP

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.138 region:rollup2
YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING

00:43:58.436 --> 00:44:01.305 region:rollup2
ON IN THE SYSTEM. AS LONG AS

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:02.507 region:rollup2
ALSO OBVIOUSLY HAVING

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:04.175 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH.

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:05.376 region:rollup2
WITH COLLEGES ADMINISTRATORS

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:06.711 region:rollup2
FACULTY ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:08.479 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:09.547 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF. HOW

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.915 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE CHANGING IN THE

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:12.083 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT WE THINK IT'S ONE

00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:13.651 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WAY TO ENSURE THAT?

00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:15.052 region:rollup2
I'M MORE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING

00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.053 region:rollup2
ON AND IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.555 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPEN THAT ARE.

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:19.023 region:rollup2
OR ISSUES THAT WE DIDN'T WE

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:20.091 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANT TO CARVE OUT THERE

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup2
COULD BE SOME.

00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup2
THOUGHT TO HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:24.362 region:rollup2
MAKE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM TO

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:25.530 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THEM.

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:27.265 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS A YOU KNOW WE

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:30.601 region:rollup2
START LOW CONTROL FUNDING. SIX

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:32.503 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. OF YOU KNOW WE HAD TO

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:34.038 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THE EL CAP WE HAD TO.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:35.473 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT THE DASHBOARD.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:38.209 region:rollup2
IT CHANGED THE.

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:39.744 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE CULTURE IN SCHOOLS

00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:42.046 region:rollup2
NOT JUST SOMETHING CONTROLLED BY

00:44:39.744 --> 00:44:43.714 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT BUT THE COMMUNITY

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:45.016 region:rollup2
AND PARENTS AND KIDS AND.

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:46.851 region:rollup2
AND REALLY CHANGED.

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:48.352 region:rollup2
.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.921 region:rollup2
THE INVOLVEMENT A COMMUNITY FOR

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:52.056 region:rollup2
OUR KATIE TWELVE RIGHT AND I

00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:53.658 region:rollup2
THINK ALL THOSE ARE GOOD. BUT TO

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:55.226 region:rollup2
WAIT SIX YEARS NOW.

00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:56.527 region:rollup2
ARE AND WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:58.029 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE NICK UNICOLOR

00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:00.231 region:rollup2
DISTRICT POLICE TO.

00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:01.232 region:rollup2
A MONETARY SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:02.900 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE LONG TIME SO DO

00:45:01.232 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup2
THE.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.869 region:rollup2
TO THE CHANCELLOR.

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.704 region:rollup2
.

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:08.372 region:rollup2
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THIS

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:10.608 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN?

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.742 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I MADE A COMMENT BACK

00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:12.843 region:rollup2
WE STARTED SIX YEARS AGO OF

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:14.045 region:rollup2
LOCAL FUNDING AS IT IS COULD

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.812 region:rollup2
TAKE FOUR TO SIX YEARS TO GET

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.048 region:rollup2
THIS THING ALONE.

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:18.182 region:rollup2
COULD YOU DON'T.

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:19.817 region:rollup2
WE HAD A LIGHT SWITCH OF PEOPLE

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:21.018 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CHANGE.

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:22.920 region:rollup2
IN OTHER GOING TO THINK HOW THEY

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:24.388 region:rollup2
USED TO DO IT SO.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.756 region:rollup2
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THE

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:27.825 region:rollup2
CHANGE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:29.126 region:rollup2
COLLEGES OF WE DO THIS?

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:30.561 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THEY ARE YOU

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.796 region:rollup2
KNOW I I MENTION CAPACITY

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.363 region:rollup2
BUILDING I THINK THAT TAKES A

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:34.198 region:rollup2
LOT OF FORMS.

00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:36.701 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD SAY THANK YOU KNOW

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:38.369 region:rollup2
WE ARE RAMPING UP THOSE EFFORTS.

00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:39.670 region:rollup2
GENERALLY I THINK THE.

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:41.038 region:rollup2
PART OF CHANCELLOR OAKLEY'S

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.473 region:rollup2
VISION IS THAT THE COMMUNITY

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:44.108 region:rollup2
COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.476 region:rollup2
PLAYS A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:47.311 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS IN

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:48.446 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM ARM. SO I THINK THERE

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:50.748 region:rollup2
ARE THERE BEEN.

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:52.817 region:rollup2
YOU NO LONGER EFFORTS.

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:54.118 region:rollup2
THE AYE IP AYE INSTITUTIONAL

00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:55.586 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS PARTNERSHIP WORK

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.787 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE DOING I THINK IS ONE

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:58.589 region:rollup2
WAY WE'VE DONE IT.

00:45:56.787 --> 00:46:00.124 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THE

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:01.892 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS WORK OF

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:03.361 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING COLLEGES AND

00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:05.162 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING GUIDED PATHWAYS IS

00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:06.697 region:rollup2
A MODEL BUT I THINK WE CAN.

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:08.366 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:09.667 region:rollup2
THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK OUR

00:46:08.366 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY BUT I.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.936 region:rollup2
.

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.237 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ARE COMMITTED AND WE

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.872 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A PART OF

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:17.675 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:18.976 region:rollup2
WORKS IS THAT. COLLEGES KNOW HOW

00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:20.978 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:22.179 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:23.814 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES THAT CREATES SO I

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:24.382 region:rollup2
THINK THAT INVOLVES WORK FROM

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.416 region:rollup2
OUR OFFICE IN THAT INVOLVES

00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:27.551 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:28.486 region:rollup2
FROM THE SYSTEM AND THINKING

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:30.421 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:32.690 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE TAKE SUCCESSFUL

00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:33.758 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IN ONE CONTEXT AND

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.859 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:46:33.758 --> 00:46:36.427 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO THE COLLEGES

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:37.762 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE?

00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:39.664 region:rollup2
ARE YOU SETTING UP A SEPARATE

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE HOT. HOW

00:46:39.664 --> 00:46:43.367 region:rollup2
YOU DOING THIS YET THE LOTTERY

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:44.969 region:rollup2
WORDS RIGHT THERE BUT I'M SURE I

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:46.037 region:rollup2
THINK I'M HARD I GRABBED ON?

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:47.838 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS WOULD BE ONE

00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:48.339 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT I THINK WE HAVE

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:50.441 region:rollup2
PROVIDED.

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:51.809 region:rollup2
SO ONE TIME RESOURCES

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.944 region:rollup2
LEGISLATUREAPPROVED ONE TIME

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:55.479 region:rollup2
RESOURCES LAST YEAR OUR OFFICE

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:57.314 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THAT WE

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.948 region:rollup2
OFTEN AND THROUGHOUT A LOT OF

00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:00.384 region:rollup2
THIS WORK.

00:46:57.948 --> 00:47:01.886 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPERTISE

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:04.055 region:rollup2
OF COLLEGES THE INSTITUTIONAL

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:05.723 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS WORK IS LARGELY IN

00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:07.191 region:rollup2
MANY CASES PEER DRIVEN BUT IT'S

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:08.693 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SUPPORTING OTHER

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:09.160 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND ADVANCING CHANGE.

00:47:08.693 --> 00:47:11.028 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:13.931 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:15.533 region:rollup2
PROPOSED ANY TYPE OF NEW

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:17.935 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE BUT I THINK WE.

00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:20.971 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CENTRALLY OUR

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:21.505 region:rollup2
OFFICE NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE.

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.340 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU CARRY BACK HIS

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.841 region:rollup2
CHANCES ARE I.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.609 region:rollup2
I LIKE TO HEAR THE DISCUSSION I

00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:27.178 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA MANAGE CHANGE THAT IS

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:28.512 region:rollup2
LISTEN ALLOCATE TO OUR WE HAD A

00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:30.648 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:32.416 region:rollup2
THE STATE. HERE'S ONE GOVERNANCE

00:47:30.648 --> 00:47:33.117 region:rollup2
BODY AND IF INDEED DO SOME LIKE

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:33.884 region:rollup2
THIS TRAINS.

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:35.786 region:rollup2
THE CULTURE.

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:37.488 region:rollup2
.

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:39.156 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU UP WHEN I READ MY STATE

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:39.990 region:rollup2
AGENCY AND I WAS CHANGING AT.

YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
.

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:47.365 region:rollup2
RESPECT YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO YOUR

00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:49.734 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES. TO GET THEM TO WHERE

00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:51.702 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO GO GET. INTO THIS

00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:52.937 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT.

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:55.239 region:rollup2
CHANGE I GUESS OF MY LAST COMING

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:56.707 region:rollup2
TO BE. AS I WAS LOOKING THIS

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.008 region:rollup2
ABOUT TALKING MY STAFF ON ITS IT

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.110 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY.

00:47:58.008 --> 00:48:00.611 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.680 region:rollup2
PAST WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:05.216 region:rollup2
WELL IN THIS IN THIS IS A COMMON

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.685 region:rollup2
THERE? MANY BUREAUCRACIES THAT

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:09.620 region:rollup2
WE REWARD ACTIVITIES.

00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:12.289 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WERE GIVEN MONEY FOR

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.091 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO DO STUFF.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.559 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A FAILURE.

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:16.394 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:18.496 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BETTER TO REWARD

00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:20.197 region:rollup2
RESULTS.

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:22.199 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ACTIVITIES BUT RESULTS

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:23.734 region:rollup2
AND SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.902 region:rollup2
IS CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.604 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE JUST THINK THAT?

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:28.105 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:48:26.604 --> 00:48:30.641 region:rollup2
YOU NO M. BUSINESSES BEEN THERE

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:33.077 region:rollup2

I WISH I COULD BE AROUND IS SIX

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:39.183 region:rollup2
YEARS HE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:39.917 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:48:39.183 --> 00:48:43.053 region:rollup2
YOU OUT.

THEIR LIFETIME OR A CONSIDERABLE

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:58.455 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME TO VOTE ON

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:59.290 region:rollup2

00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:02.626 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

SIX MONTHS.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.238 region:rollup2
PROVIDE JANUARY TO JUNE IS

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:16.006 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:18.275 region:rollup2
TO REALLY MAKE INFORMED

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:20.444 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ON SOMETHING SO

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:22.479 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS THIS.

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:24.515 region:rollup2

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:27.952 region:rollup2

00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:34.959 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.961 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:38.862 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO.

00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:39.463 region:rollup2
TO TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:41.365 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL THAT I

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:44.401 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:51:41.365 --> 00:51:46.704 region:rollup2
SO I I I THINK THIS IS TOO

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:48.539 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT A DECISION.

00:51:46.704 --> 00:51:50.674 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:52.176 region:rollup2

REALIZE IT'S.

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:07.291 region:rollup2
A LOFTY GOAL.

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:08.926 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:10.361 region:rollup2
ANYONE WHO CARES MORE ABOUT

BUT I AM STRUCK.

00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:22.339 region:rollup2
ALSO BY WHAT I'VE SOMETIMES SEEN

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:24.041 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATION HOW THE PENDULUM

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:26.043 region:rollup2
SWINGS.

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:27.544 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATION.

AND I AGAIN WOULD ASK WHERE ARE

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:35.619 region:rollup2
THE FACTS

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.754 region:rollup2
WORDS WERE IS THE DATA WHERE IS

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:37.621 region:rollup2

00:52:36.754 --> 00:52:39.423 region:rollup2
HEARD GOOD QUESTIONS.

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:42.092 region:rollup2

BE THE CONSEQUENCES TWENTY FIVE

00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:45.929 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:52:45.763 --> 00:52:47.331 region:rollup2

OUT OF THOSE ROUND OF

00:53:04.248 --> 00:53:06.884 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES THAT SCHOOL

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:08.619 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:12.389 region:rollup2
A DISCOURAGE STUDENTS

00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:15.359 region:rollup2

AND AGAIN I'VE HEARD FROM

00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:21.432 region:rollup2
FACULTY.

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:24.501 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD BE PRESSURE TO.

00:53:21.432 --> 00:53:27.337 region:rollup2

00:53:27.337 --> 00:53:30.941 region:rollup2
MUCH STRUCK BY THE THE TIME

FRAME. OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:36.113 region:rollup2
DO HERE. AND US AND SAY WOULD

00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:37.748 region:rollup2
AND ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT. IS

00:53:36.113 --> 00:53:39.216 region:rollup2
THE HURRY SO LET ME ASK THAT

00:53:37.748 --> 00:53:40.384 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHAT IS THE VERY WHY

00:53:39.216 --> 00:53:42.753 region:rollup2
ARE WE TRYING TO DO THOSE SO

00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:44.488 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:46.824 region:rollup2
SO. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS

00:53:44.488 --> 00:53:47.791 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AND

00:53:46.824 --> 00:53:50.060 region:rollup2
ENGAGING WITH.

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:51.462 region:rollup2
IT DISTRICTS IS A CURRENT MODEL

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.863 region:rollup2
IS JUST NOT WORKING AND LOOKING

00:53:51.462 --> 00:53:55.999 region:rollup2
AT.

00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:57.468 region:rollup2
AT THE RAISING COSTS AND

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:59.536 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT A ROMAN TRANSIT

00:53:57.468 --> 00:54:01.405 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF VOLATILITY AND

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:03.507 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING MODEL AND MAKES IT

00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:05.175 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGES.

00:54:03.507 --> 00:54:07.778 region:rollup2
ADDS TO PLAN SO THIS IS A

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:08.312 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

00:54:07.778 --> 00:54:11.915 region:rollup2
HEARING.

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:13.217 region:rollup2
AT AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:15.853 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT.

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:17.988 region:rollup2
AT THIS MOMENT AYE THIS IT IS

00:54:15.853 --> 00:54:19.957 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ALIGN THE FUNDING

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:22.159 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES AND THE INCENTIVES.

00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:24.394 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER ENHANCE AND SUPPORT

00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:25.996 region:rollup2
AT THE STUDENT SUCCESS WORK THAT

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:27.931 region:rollup2
IS HAPPENING A CURRENTLY WITH

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:30.167 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS WIT AB SEVEN OH

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:31.602 region:rollup2
FIVE AND RE SHIFTING THE

00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:33.737 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES AND THE GOAL IS TO

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.771 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT NOT JUST ONE FACTOR

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:36.774 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.574 region:rollup2
BUT THINKING ABOUT AS STUDENT

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.409 region:rollup2
SUCCESS

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.978 region:rollup2
AND ALIGNING THE FISCAL

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:43.046 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES WAYS.

00:54:40.978 --> 00:54:44.681 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:46.550 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING SO WE THINK

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:48.118 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP ON

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.354 region:rollup2
FURTHERING AND HAD SEEN THAT

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:51.588 region:rollup2

00:54:50.354 --> 00:54:53.257 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT.

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:54.091 region:rollup2
BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE

00:54:53.257 --> 00:54:55.325 region:rollup2
TRANSITION.

00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:57.094 region:rollup2
TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:59.296 region:rollup2
WE'VE INCLUDED A HOLD HARMLESS

00:54:57.094 --> 00:55:01.865 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS AND

00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:02.900 region:rollup2
HAVE TIME TO PLAN AND TO KNOW

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:04.535 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH FUNDING THEY WILL BE

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.103 region:rollup2
GETTING AS A TRANSITION TO THE

00:55:04.535 --> 00:55:06.803 region:rollup2
NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND WE HAVE

00:55:06.103 --> 00:55:09.907 region:rollup2
AN ON GOING.

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:10.174 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS AS WELL AS PART

00:55:09.907 --> 00:55:12.075 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

00:55:10.174 --> 00:55:14.111 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THINKING ABOUT.

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:15.579 region:rollup2
AT PROVIDING THE COLLEGES WITH

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:17.147 region:rollup2
SAM AND STABILITY IN PLANNING

00:55:15.579 --> 00:55:18.248 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE ALL

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:21.485 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:22.920 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN TRAINING CORPORATE INTO

00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:25.189 region:rollup2
INTO OUR PROPOSAL.

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.958 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST AND AND I. RESPECT

00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR PLOT POINT ABOUT US

00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TO WORK WITH

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:33.096 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS IF THERE'S WORK THAT

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:33.497 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE DOING OVER THE NEXT

00:55:33.096 --> 00:55:36.366 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS.

00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:36.600 region:rollup2
WE ARE HAPPY TO DO IT I DO ONE

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.601 region:rollup2
IT JUST.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.902 region:rollup2
.

00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:39.469 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAYBE SUGGEST THAT I

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:44.608 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THIS IS THE THIS

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:46.877 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN.

00:55:44.608 --> 00:55:48.779 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED IN OUR SYSTEM IN THE

00:55:46.877 --> 00:55:50.447 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST DECADE

00:55:48.779 --> 00:55:51.448 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THIS IS A CONVERT

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENED

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:54.084 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.319 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THOSE PROPOSALS

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.852 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN ENACTED WE THINK

00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:58.155 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:59.590 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MODEST STEP FORWARD

00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:01.758 region:rollup2
THAT BEGINS TO.

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:03.961 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:06.930 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL VALUES VALUES AROUND.

00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:07.464 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BEGINNING TO CONSIDER

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.466 region:rollup2
AS PART OF A FONT FUNDING

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:11.034 region:rollup2
FORMULA STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:12.870 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:14.571 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT A. YOU KNOW

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:16.306 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE AND THEN.

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:17.307 region:rollup2
THIS EMPHASIS ON PERFORMANCE

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:19.243 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY I THINK THE

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.710 region:rollup2
TIMING IN MANY WAYS IS DRIVEN BY

00:56:19.243 --> 00:56:20.944 region:rollup2
OUR BOARDS.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.512 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE VISION

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:24.281 region:rollup2
FOR SUCCESS THAT WE NEED TO

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:25.482 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO DO MORE BUT A PRETTY

00:56:24.281 --> 00:56:27.317 region:rollup2
FAST TIME FRAME THAT THE VISION

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:28.318 region:rollup2
FOR SUCCESS SAYS THAT WE WILL

00:56:27.317 --> 00:56:30.087 region:rollup2
MEET THE GOALS BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:31.855 region:rollup2
TWO. AND IF WE'RE GONNA.

00:56:30.087 --> 00:56:33.690 region:rollup2
YET ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS I THINK

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:36.226 region:rollup2
WE FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY THAT.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:38.362 region:rollup2
THE WORK NEEDS TO BEGIN

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:40.030 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY.

00:56:38.362 --> 00:56:41.965 region:rollup2
I I HEARD SAID THAT.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.233 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:45.602 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN THAT.

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:47.104 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP AND THAT IT'S BEEN

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:49.273 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST DECADE

00:56:47.104 --> 00:56:51.275 region:rollup2
BUT I I I WOULD REMIND THE

00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:53.844 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THAT. THAT AS A SENIOR

00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:55.412 region:rollup2
MEMBER THERE'S NO ONE WHO'S BEEN

00:56:53.844 --> 00:56:57.948 region:rollup2
IN THIS LEGISLATURE LONGER THAN

00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:59.449 region:rollup2
I. A AND THAT'S FIVE YEARS SIX

00:56:57.948 --> 00:57:00.951 region:rollup2
YEARS RIGHT NOW. AND.

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:03.287 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:57:00.951 --> 00:57:04.288 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT AND

00:57:03.287 --> 00:57:05.589 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IT I MEAN I DON'T

00:57:04.288 --> 00:57:06.857 region:rollup2
MEAN TO SUGGEST THIS SPECIFIC

00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:08.625 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THESE TYPES

00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:09.526 region:rollup2
OF CONCEPTS THINKING ABOUT

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:11.161 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:12.429 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCE.

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:14.031 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:15.532 region:rollup2
CONTEXT I THINK THESE ARE.

00:57:14.031 --> 00:57:16.934 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN THE

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:18.835 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS TASK FORCE ON

00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:21.104 region:rollup2
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:22.039 region:rollup2
WORK LED BY OUR PARTNERS.

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.040 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN FOR

00:57:22.039 --> 00:57:25.309 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY PREVIOUSLY

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.842 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU WRITE. THIS PROPOSAL

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:28.745 region:rollup2
IS CERTAINLY.

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:29.913 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAME

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.681 region:rollup2
OUT IN JANUARY BUT I.

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:32.349 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE'VE.

00:57:30.681 --> 00:57:33.650 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN DELIBERATING ON

00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:38.088 region:rollup2
SIMILAR ISSUES.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:39.456 region:rollup2
FOR FIRST A NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:57:38.088 --> 00:57:40.924 region:rollup2
I I HAVE NO OTHER.

00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:42.926 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I DON'T HAVE ANY

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:44.528 region:rollup2
OTHER RECOURSE THAN TO TO SAY

00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:46.463 region:rollup2
THAT I I I WOULD THINK THAT THE.

00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:47.030 region:rollup2
.

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:48.899 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SLOW THE PROCESS

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:51.001 region:rollup2
DOWN.

00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:54.471 region:rollup2
IF I DON'T FEEL.

00:57:51.001 --> 00:57:55.906 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN IN THE PROCESS I I

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:56.473 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT

00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:58.475 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF. FOLKS IN

00:57:56.473 --> 00:58:00.010 region:rollup2
THE.

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:00.577 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNICABLE ITS

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:02.579 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT FEEL THE SAME

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:04.981 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:07.050 region:rollup2
AND I JUST DON'T THINK THE BEST

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:12.022 region:rollup2
POLICY IS EVER MADE JUST RUSSIAN

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:13.557 region:rollup2
IT THROUGH.

00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:15.058 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBERS ONLY

00:58:13.557 --> 00:58:16.660 region:rollup2
MEMBER LIMON.

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:18.628 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.397 region:rollup2
COMMENTS I THINK FROM COLLEAGUES

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:22.532 region:rollup2
IT THEY'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY

00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:25.669 region:rollup2
HELPFUL IN IN THINKING THROUGH

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:27.404 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES. AND MY QUESTION IS

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:28.605 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S FOR YOU KNOW.

00:58:27.404 --> 00:58:30.841 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:31.575 region:rollup2
AS I KEEP HEARING IN THE FUNDING

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:34.478 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

00:58:31.575 --> 00:58:35.912 region:rollup2
I ALSO KEEP REFERENCING TO THE

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:37.814 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE I HAD AS A SCHOOL

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:39.649 region:rollup2
BOARD MEMBER WITHOUT LC FF AND

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:40.283 region:rollup2
THEN WITH KELSEY FF.

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:42.786 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:44.054 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THAT THERE IS A LOT.

00:58:42.786 --> 00:58:46.656 region:rollup2
THE FEELINGS THAT ARE VERY

00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:49.059 region:rollup2
SIMILAR AROUND MOVING TO A LOCAL

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:51.995 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

00:58:49.059 --> 00:58:54.197 region:rollup2
BUT I ASK MYSELF WHAT DO SUCCESS

00:58:51.995 --> 00:59:04.374 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE UNDER THIS FUNDING

00:58:54.197 --> 00:59:05.409 region:rollup2
FORMULA IN THE EYES OF STUDENTS.

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.877 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK FUND IT AYE I THINK

00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:09.379 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS.

00:59:06.877 --> 00:59:11.848 region:rollup2
IMPROVED DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:15.252 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT IMPROVE TRANSFER OR.

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:16.253 region:rollup2
IMPROVE COMPLETION OF CAREER

00:59:15.252 --> 00:59:18.422 region:rollup2
ORIENTED PROGRAMS.

00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:20.323 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AMONG STUDENTS TO.

00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:21.992 region:rollup2
WE SEE GAPS IN PERFORMANCE THAT

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:24.594 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:26.196 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE A. I ACTUALLY THINK

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:28.031 region:rollup2
THAT DOES SOUND LIKE GOALS THAT

00:59:26.196 --> 00:59:29.599 region:rollup2
YOU MAY ALL HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:32.068 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT IS GONNA

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:33.570 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE LIFE OF A STUDENT.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:35.172 region:rollup2
ON EVERY DAY BASES A COMMUNITY

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:37.707 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:59:35.172 --> 00:59:39.709 region:rollup2
CAMPUS BY GOING TO THIS FOR

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:41.144 region:rollup2
THIS FORMULA LIKE WHAT IT IS WAS

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:41.978 region:rollup2
THEIR EXPERIENCE GOING TO BE

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:43.980 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:47.050 region:rollup2
ARE THEY GONNA HAVE MORE ACCESS

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.985 region:rollup2
TO PROGRAMS LESS ACCESS. AND OR

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:50.153 region:rollup2
LIMITED ACCESS BUT NOW MORE

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:51.688 region:rollup2
FOCUSED AS OPPOSED TO MUCH

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:54.157 region:rollup2
GENERAL ADVISING WHAT DOES THIS

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:56.126 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK LIKE. FROM A STUDENT

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:57.594 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:59:56.126 --> 00:59:58.695 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD JUST ECHO SOME OF

00:59:57.594 --> 00:59:59.796 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS THAT THE LA ALL

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:01.465 region:rollup2
MADE THAT.

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:03.433 region:rollup2
THERE IS THROUGH RESEARCH THAT

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:04.968 region:rollup2
CORRELATES AT AN INCENTIVE SOME

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:07.003 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULAS WITH BEHAVIORAL

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:08.505 region:rollup2
CHANGES AT THE INSTITUTION.

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:09.372 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE REVAMPING STUDENT

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:11.208 region:rollup2
ADVISING STREAMLINING

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:12.742 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY PROCESS THESE

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:14.878 region:rollup2
INCREASING DATA TO INFORM

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:16.279 region:rollup2
DECISIONS SO THERE IS RESEARCH

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:18.248 region:rollup2
OUT THERE THAT'S SHOWS I'M VERY

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:21.451 region:rollup2
REAL PRACTICES AND BEHAVIORS

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:23.153 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE WHEN THE FINANCIAL

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.721 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES CHANGE.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:26.056 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND AND AGAIN THAT IS I

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.457 region:rollup2
THINK A RESPONSE AND.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:29.659 region:rollup2
IT THAT THAT SOUNDS TO ME FROM

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:31.294 region:rollup2
THE EYES OF AN ADMINISTRATOR

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.929 region:rollup2
RATE SO WHEN I THINK OF THIS IS

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
SO INCREASE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.499 region:rollup2
AID SO THERE'S GONNA BE LESS

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.800 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID LINES ARE NOT HAVE

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.868 region:rollup2
TO WAIT IN LINE LONGER THE

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.735 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS GOING TO GO FASTER

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:40.036 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA. GET AN EMERGENCY

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.638 region:rollup2
LOAN LIKE WHAT DOES THIS LOOK

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:43.140 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR STUDENTS THEY'RE GONNA

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.375 region:rollup2
GET TO SEE AN ADVISER A

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.310 region:rollup2
COUNSELOR SOONER. AND THEIR

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup2
CLASSES ARE GOING TO BE FULL AND

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.646 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:52.449 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SEMESTER TO GET YOU KNOW

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:53.650 region:rollup2
THE A GET THE CLASSES WHAT IS IT

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.484 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE FOR STUDENTS.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.886 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT I THINK THERE ARE

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.954 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PRACTICES THAT WE'VE

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:59.222 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL COLLEGES

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:01.358 region:rollup2
LAKE I'M NOT STREAMLINING

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:03.693 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INVESTING IN SOFTWARE

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.227 region:rollup2
TO STREAMLINE FINANCIAL APOSTASY

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:04.728 region:rollup2
SO HE COULD AND HE GET OUT

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.996 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:08.331 region:rollup2
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:09.566 region:rollup2
STUDENT TO STREAMLINE THE

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.734 region:rollup2
PROCESS SEES WHAT IS THAT MEAN

01:01:09.566 --> 01:01:11.968 region:rollup2
FOR THE STUDENTS STUDENT AS I

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:13.270 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE THEY'RE

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.472 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:17.741 region:rollup2
MUCH QUICKER SO THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:20.610 region:rollup2
PLAN. AND.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:21.444 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR THE PROGRAMS.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.045 region:rollup2
BUT BY EMPRESS FOR SOME OF

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:24.014 region:rollup2
FINANCE I WOULD ALSO ADD THE

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:25.549 region:rollup2
WHAT IT MEANS FOR STUDENT IS NOW

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:27.317 region:rollup2
THAT THAT STAFF IS NO LONGER

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:28.919 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE MANUAL PROCESSING

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:30.120 region:rollup2
OF APPLICATIONS. GRADUALLY

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:32.222 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.391 region:rollup2
THAT THE STUDENT WOULD HAVE. TO

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.292 region:rollup2
HELP THEM FILL OUT THE THE FORMS

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.360 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE GETTING STUCK ON A

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:39.262 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR YOU KNOW BOX IN THE

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.564 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF WHAT THAT MEANS. SO

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:42.933 region:rollup2
REALLY FROM A STUDENT THEY HAVE

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:43.867 region:rollup2
MORE ACCESS TO THE TYPES OF HELP

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.769 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO COMPLETE

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:47.637 region:rollup2
THEIR APPLICATIONS. TO RECEIVE

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:50.140 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID I THINK YOU WILL

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:52.309 region:rollup2
SEE COLLEGES LOOK POURED SOME OF

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:54.244 region:rollup2
THOSE ASPECTS I'M IF WE LOOK

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:55.779 region:rollup2
PORT AB SEVEN OH FIVE. YOU KNOW

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:57.314 region:rollup2
IT IT'S THOSE TYPE OF ASPECTS

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:58.815 region:rollup2
WERE FROM A STUDENT NOW YOUR

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:00.784 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL GPA AND TRANSCRIPT

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:02.586 region:rollup2
DATA MAY BE USED. TO HELP PLACE

01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:04.120 region:rollup2
TO IN COURSES SO THAT YOU CAN

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:05.889 region:rollup2
BETTER OUT COMPLETE.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.390 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:09.626 region:rollup2
COURSES IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.061 region:rollup2
WHICH ACTUALLY LEADS TO A MORE

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:14.364 region:rollup2
TIMELY COMPLETION OF YOUR DEGREE

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:15.765 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE REAL WORLD THINGS

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:17.067 region:rollup2
THAT A STUDENT WOULD SEE.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.968 region:rollup2
WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW. SPEAKING

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.903 region:rollup2
OF TIME TO DEGREE I MEAN THAT

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:21.304 region:rollup2
MEANS A LOT FOR THOSE OF US THAT

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:23.240 region:rollup2
WORKED ON TIME TO AGREE I JUST.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.873 region:rollup2
YET YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD GOAL

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.141 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:26.409 region:rollup2
OUT HOW IT HELPS THE EVERYDAY

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.410 region:rollup2
STUDENT BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:31.581 region:rollup2
FOR ME ONE OF THE PIECES THAT'S

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:33.550 region:rollup2
BEEN MISSING I HEAR A LOT OF THE

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:36.519 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE GOALS IT HAS BUT I ALSO

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:38.655 region:rollup2
THINK. THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDING

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:40.890 region:rollup2
FORMULAS DATE THE PENDULUM DOES

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:41.391 region:rollup2
SWING IT DOES GO FROM ONE STATE

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:41.891 region:rollup2
TO ANOTHER WE BELIEVING

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.693 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL AS WERE VERY

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:45.762 region:rollup2
FOCUSED.

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:46.963 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE KIND OF MOVE BACK

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:49.733 region:rollup2
AND WE DO MORE OF A BLOCK GRANT

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:51.167 region:rollup2
OR SOME LC FF MODEL. AND I JUST

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:54.037 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:55.672 region:rollup2
MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION OUT WE

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:58.842 region:rollup2
DON'T LOSE SIGHT THAT IF THE

01:02:55.672 --> 01:03:02.045 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NOT SEEN. THIS THAT

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:03.446 region:rollup2
POSITIVE IMPACT I THINK IT IT IT

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:05.749 region:rollup2
BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:07.250 region:rollup2
I. AND.

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:08.985 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:11.054 region:rollup2
THERE IS DEFINITELY AA THINK.

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:13.223 region:rollup2
.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:14.457 region:rollup2
TO PROPOSALS THAT HAVE JET AND

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:15.959 region:rollup2
GENERATED A LOT OF CONVERSATION

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.661 region:rollup2
HOME AROUND THE COMMUNITY

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:19.362 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THIS BEING ONE OF THEM.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:20.497 region:rollup2
AND THE PROPOSAL AND IN THE THE

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.731 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AT LEAST FROM THE

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:23.466 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:27.070 region:rollup2
GENERATE MORE QUESTIONS AND

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:28.571 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND I WONDER WHAT THAT.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.240 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND AND NOT NECESSARILY

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:31.875 region:rollup2
STRICT OPPOSITION AS IS MORE OF

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.743 region:rollup2
LIKE HERE'S.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:35.178 region:rollup2
BUDGET QUESTIONS TO ASK

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:37.714 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:39.149 region:rollup2
AT THE HOLD HARMLESS AND IN THE

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:40.850 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS CAME FROM THE K.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.052 region:rollup2
TO TWELVE HEALTHY FF WORLD LIKE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.353 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:45.055 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN FROM A SPACE WHERE

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
THERE WERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:48.191 region:rollup2
AND OVER COMING TO LEGISLATORS

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.592 region:rollup2
AND SAY. WE ARE YOU KNOW NOT

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
BENEFITING FROM THIS.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.962 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THE LOSERS THE

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:55.198 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS DISCOURSE

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:58.234 region:rollup2
CAME FROM THAT AND. AND THOSE

01:03:55.198 --> 01:04:00.437 region:rollup2
CONCERNS BY I THINK WE HAVE WAYS

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:02.372 region:rollup2
TO GO TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:04.274 region:rollup2
TO BRING FOLKS ON BOARD I DON'T

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:05.608 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE STEPS ARE I FEEL

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.142 region:rollup2
LIKE I ACTUALLY THE COMMUNITY

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:06.910 region:rollup2
COLLEGES I THINK HAVE BEEN

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:09.145 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:10.947 region:rollup2
AN EXCELLENT JOB AND HOLDING

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:12.782 region:rollup2
REGIONAL MEETINGS WAY IF

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.818 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS BUT

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:16.152 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:17.821 region:rollup2
HELPFUL BUT THEY HAVEN'T MET.

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:19.856 region:rollup2
AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REALLY

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.257 region:rollup2
BRINGING EVERYBODY EDUCATORS

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:24.627 region:rollup2
INCLUDED ONBOARD.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:25.862 region:rollup2
TO SAY HEY I THINK WE CAN MOVE

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:29.933 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH THIS.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:31.968 region:rollup2
AND IN THE END FOR ME IF I AM.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:35.705 region:rollup2
IF THE STUDENT IS GOING TO SEE

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:38.308 region:rollup2
KIND OF EVERY DAY EXPERIENCE OR.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:40.677 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATUS QUO IN SOME WAY.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:43.046 region:rollup2
I WORRY THAT WE HAVEN'T PUT

01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:44.748 region:rollup2
THAT STEPS IN THE STRUCTURE THE

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.783 region:rollup2
PATHWAY THERE TO GET TO THESE

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:48.084 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD GOALS THAT I CAN

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:49.319 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH ALL THOSE GOAL YOU'VE

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.987 region:rollup2
MENTIONED NOT ONE GOAL THAT I

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:52.155 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH. THAT I THINK

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BAD FOR STUDENTS.

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:56.192 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT IF THE

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.660 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS NOT CREATED. TO GET

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:59.295 region:rollup2
BOTH EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.897 region:rollup2
THERE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:02.532 region:rollup2
TO THE SCHOOLS.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:04.033 region:rollup2
SO AND YOU KNOW I A HERE THE

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:05.802 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL'S I HEAR THE COMMENTS

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.604 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:12.809 region:rollup2
I'M STILL KIND OF THINKING OF

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.978 region:rollup2
WHAT SPACE WHAT'S MISSING TO GET

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
US THERE A IS IT TIME THAT'S

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:19.682 region:rollup2
MISSING IS IT MORE STAKEHOLDER

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.950 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT AND.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:22.152 region:rollup2
I YOU KNOW I I MET LITTLE BIT AT

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.520 region:rollup2
A LOSS I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:24.788 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION TO OFFER.

THERE.

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:36.366 region:rollup2

IS THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS WHO

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.277 region:rollup2
BATES BASICALLY ONLY PROTECT

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:29.546 region:rollup2
THEM FOR ONE YEAR.

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:32.148 region:rollup2

FUNDING FORMULA GOES FORWARD AS

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:41.758 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY DEFINED BY THE

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:44.694 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITHOUT

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:47.630 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPERIENCE.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:50.199 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND ANALYSIS OF THE

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:52.435 region:rollup2
C. E. O.'S AND CB OWES OF OUR

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:54.370 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE IS. THIS MAY PROVE

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:55.838 region:rollup2
TO BE THE WORST EXPERIMENT AND

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.407 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

01:07:55.838 --> 01:08:00.076 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS EVER SEEN.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:01.644 region:rollup2
SO.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.379 region:rollup2

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:05.248 region:rollup2
COMING FROM. YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.382 region:rollup2
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF RUNNING ONE

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.083 region:rollup2
OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMITTEE

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.052 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
RACES.

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:14.591 region:rollup2
SERIOUS DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:17.360 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:19.662 region:rollup2
FINANCE HAS CONSULTED WITH OUR

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.431 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE LEADERS WHO HAVE

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:27.337 region:rollup2
BEEN PRODUCING THE SUCCESSFUL

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:27.904 region:rollup2
RESULTS?

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:30.673 region:rollup2
I SEE ME LIKE A RESPONSE TO

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:32.041 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:35.244 region:rollup2
IF YOU LIKE MAYBE THERE ARE

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:36.946 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:38.414 region:rollup2
YEAH I'VE I THINK ONE OF THE

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.416 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WE'VE FACED.

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:41.884 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROCESS IS THERE IS A

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.553 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR STARTING.

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.687 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:46.489 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY AND I THINK THE

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:50.059 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY.

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:51.327 region:rollup2
IS MAKING OF FOLKS YOU KNOW.

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:53.363 region:rollup2
ANXIOUS IS PROBABLY A VERY.

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:55.064 region:rollup2
MILDLY TO PUT IT I THINK

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:57.567 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DESIGN IN OUR

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:58.735 region:rollup2
INTENT WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.002 region:rollup2
CEOS THAT WE'VE CONSULTED WITH

01:08:58.735 --> 01:09:01.471 region:rollup2
PICK AND.

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:03.573 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR OAKLEY ASKED A GROUP

01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:04.974 region:rollup2
OF CIOS TO THINK THROUGH THE

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:07.777 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.777 region:rollup2
HEAT WE'VE RELIED ON THE ADVICE

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:11.147 region:rollup2
ADVISORY WORK GROUP ON FISCAL

01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:13.049 region:rollup2
AFFAIRS WHICH IS A GROUP OF CBO

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:14.384 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH THEM I

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:16.319 region:rollup2
THINK THERE IS A STRONG

01:09:14.384 --> 01:09:17.053 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FROM BOTH OF

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.889 region:rollup2
THOSE GROUPS THAT.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:21.257 region:rollup2
WE NEED A HOLD HARMLESS THAT IS.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:23.126 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:24.694 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL A DISTRICT WOULD GET NO

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:26.195 region:rollup2
LESS THAN A GETS IN SEVENTEEN

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:29.065 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. AND THEN BEGINNING IN

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.299 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY OF A DISTRICT

01:09:29.065 --> 01:09:32.368 region:rollup2
WOULD GET NO LESS ON A PER

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:33.569 region:rollup2
STUDENT BASIS I THINK WHAT THE

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:37.106 region:rollup2
LETTER SUGGESTS IS THAT.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:38.207 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ARE SEEKING A OF A

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.909 region:rollup2
LONGER PERIOD WHERE THEY ARE

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:42.045 region:rollup2
HELD AT NO LESS THAN THE

01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:42.745 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVELS AND I

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:45.114 region:rollup2
THINK FOR MANY DISTRICTS.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:46.416 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD LIKE NO LESS THAN

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:49.485 region:rollup2
THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVELS

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:51.554 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF LIVING.

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:52.422 region:rollup2
.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.089 region:rollup2
HE KNOWS THE. YEAH.

01:09:52.422 --> 01:09:54.457 region:rollup2
WE HEAR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:56.693 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TAKING IT

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:57.293 region:rollup2
INTO VERY STRONG CONSIDERATION

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:59.462 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK ABOUT

01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:00.763 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS A TO MAKE TO THE

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:02.131 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.866 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES ONE THAT WAS.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:05.768 region:rollup2
PRODUCT BY THE LEGISLATIVE

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.403 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT BE. UP THE

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:09.872 region:rollup2
LONGER YOU.

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:11.874 region:rollup2
HOLD DISTRICTS HARMLESS AND THE

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.175 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY WE SPEND FOR THOSE

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.109 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

01:10:12.175 --> 01:10:14.744 region:rollup2
.

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:16.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S LESS MONEY THAT WE ARE

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:17.547 region:rollup2
ABLE TO USE TO CREATE THE TYPES

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.848 region:rollup2
OF INCENTIVES WE WANT TO CREATE

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.116 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S THE BALANCE

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:23.619 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:25.188 region:rollup2
TO STRIKE NAM. BUT I I HOPE AND

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.756 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE YOU KNOW. THE

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:28.357 region:rollup2
MESSAGE WE WOULD GIVE IS THAT WE

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:31.027 region:rollup2
HAVE HEARD A LOT OF THESE

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:32.495 region:rollup2
CONCERNS LOUD AND CLEAR WE ARE.

01:10:31.027 --> 01:10:34.397 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT

01:10:32.495 --> 01:10:36.466 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A GOAL

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.133 region:rollup2
OF TRYING TO. BUY IMPLEMENT A

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.702 region:rollup2
FORMULA THAT.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:41.437 region:rollup2
ACHIEVES THE KINDS OF

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:43.372 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR.

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:44.874 region:rollup2
FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.475 region:rollup2
THAT AND ENCOURAGES THE TYPES OF

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:47.310 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:48.377 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.412 region:rollup2

THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TIME TO

STUDY THIS IS THIS IS BEN RUSHD

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:01.203 region:rollup2
IF ANYONE WERE TO SAVE IT TO ANY

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.538 region:rollup2
REASONABLE PERSON WE'RE GONNA

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.506 region:rollup2
OVERHAUL THE COME. WE'RE GOING

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:05.574 region:rollup2

INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:10.846 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES WITH VERY

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.447 region:rollup2
LITTLE SHOULD STAKEHOLDER INPUT.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.149 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT IN A FEW

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:15.184 region:rollup2
MONTHS TIME PEOPLE THINK YOU

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:16.819 region:rollup2
WOULD BE CRAZY TO DO THAT SO WE

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.054 region:rollup2
NEED FAR MORE TIME TO STUDY THIS

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.555 region:rollup2
IN DETAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE SO

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.656 region:rollup2
MANY. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:23.259 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:24.427 region:rollup2
YET WITH THIS AND LASTLY IT WAS

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:25.861 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ABOUT THE HOLD

01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:27.496 region:rollup2
HARMLESS WHICH IS BASICALLY GIVE

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:29.498 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THEIR BUDGETS. THAT

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.700 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THIS YEAR AND KEEP

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.934 region:rollup2
THEM AT THAT LEVEL.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.135 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.270 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE BASIC EIGHT

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.504 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS NOW THOUGH THE

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.906 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT DON'T RELY ON

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:39.075 region:rollup2
STATE APPORTIONMENT THE FUNCTION

01:14:36.906 --> 01:14:40.743 region:rollup2
WHY NOT ADOPT THAT FUNDING MODEL

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:42.011 region:rollup2
FOR ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHY

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:43.446 region:rollup2

YOU CAN TO SERVE STUDENTS WHICH

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.552 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE DO WITH TEN PERCENT

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup2
OF THE DISTRICTS WHY CAN'T THAT

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:51.787 region:rollup2
BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:55.691 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS.

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:56.826 region:rollup2

FUNDING FORMULA COURTS WITHIN

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:39.135 region:rollup2
MIT THIS IS A BROAD OUTLINE THEY

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:41.103 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT RUN ONE SIMULATION AND

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:42.838 region:rollup2
HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT. THE

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:44.140 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO.

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:45.207 region:rollup2
IF YOUR GONNA GO AHEAD AND

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.842 region:rollup2
APPROVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.677 region:rollup2
WHICH NO SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:50.212 region:rollup2
DONE THAT THIS IS GOD THIS IS

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:51.514 region:rollup2
JUST CRAZY. OKAY.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.748 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THE OTHER THING I DO

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:54.250 region:rollup2
WANT TO SAY NO ONE MAKE SURE

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:55.851 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS IS

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.219 region:rollup2
THAT WITHIN THE CURRENT FUNDING

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
FORMULA WHICH WE HAVE A GROWTH

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:00.322 region:rollup2
MULLIN WHICH OCCURRED. SINCE I

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.490 region:rollup2
SPS THREE SIXTEEN AND TWO

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:03.459 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:05.127 region:rollup2
OKAY WE DO IT WITH THERE IS A

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:07.263 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT MORE MONEY NEEDS TO

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:09.231 region:rollup2
GO TO THE TO THOSE DISTRICTS

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:11.100 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SERVING ON A. A VERY

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:13.269 region:rollup2
NEEDY STUDENTS SO IN THE AYE

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.737 region:rollup2
FORMULA WE ALREADY HAVE OF OF A

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:16.205 region:rollup2
A FACTOR THAT INVOLVES

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.140 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:16:16.205 --> 01:16:19.675 region:rollup2
I'M POVERTY. AND THERE'S ANOTHER

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:22.478 region:rollup2
ONE THAT ALSO IN YOUR DISTRICT

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:25.448 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF DEGREE.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:27.016 region:rollup2
GRADUATE DEGREES THERE IN YOUR

01:16:25.448 --> 01:16:28.717 region:rollup2
DISTRICT SO IF YOU'RE IN A

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:30.219 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT HOUSED LA LOT OF

01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.787 region:rollup2
NON DEGREE EARNERS YOU'RE GOING

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:33.055 region:rollup2
TO GET MORE MONEY.

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:35.491 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO BE.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:36.826 region:rollup2
ALSO HOW MANY PELL GRANTS THAT

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:38.861 region:rollup2
ARE BEING SERVED IN THE DISTRICT

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:40.296 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE ALREADY FACTORS ARE

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:43.265 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THE BUDGET FORMULA

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:44.934 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. AND SO IS NOT AS IF

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.935 region:rollup2
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE THOSE

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.435 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND THINGS IT'S BEEN IN

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.537 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR OVER TEN YEARS

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:50.739 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:52.908 region:rollup2
SO ALL IF IF WE NEED TO ADJUST

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.577 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES SOME SENSE SMALL

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:56.412 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS I'M FINE WITH THAT.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.913 region:rollup2
BUT. NO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:16:56.412 --> 01:17:00.382 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THESE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:17:01.016 region:rollup2
FACTORS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:04.720 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT BUDGET POINT. THANK

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:48.130 region:rollup2
WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:50.199 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING BUT

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:52.134 region:rollup2
WE ARE OPPOSED TO ANY FUNDING

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:53.836 region:rollup2
FORMULA THAT HAS.

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:55.704 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING FOR

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:57.273 region:rollup2
SEVERAL REASONS ONE OF THEM IS

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:58.874 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:00.442 region:rollup2
IT MOVES THE NEEDLE ON OVERALL

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:01.777 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THAT

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.845 region:rollup2
IS THE GOAL. ON THAT'S

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:04.880 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S GOAL.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.948 region:rollup2
.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.516 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH THE

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:09.485 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE SPACE PIECE IS THAT

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.519 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:13.489 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S AN INHERENTLY

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:16.225 region:rollup2
FLAWED IDEA TO THINK. THAT IF WE

01:18:13.489 --> 01:18:18.060 region:rollup2
CHANGE HOW WE FIND THE COLLEGE

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:18.994 region:rollup2
ON OUTCOMES THAT IT WILL CHANGE

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.263 region:rollup2
THE THE.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:23.098 region:rollup2
ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THE

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:25.501 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:27.469 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FACULTY ARE DEDICATED TO

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:29.338 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES OF THEIR STUDENTS.

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:31.040 region:rollup2
WE.

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:32.074 region:rollup2

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.310 region:rollup2

IN THE STATE.

01:18:38.047 --> 01:18:40.249 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE UNINTENDED

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:42.217 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE ARE

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:43.652 region:rollup2

DISENFRANCHISEMENT FURTHER

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:50.793 region:rollup2

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:53.529 region:rollup2
SO.

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:56.164 region:rollup2
WE STAND TO LOSE IN MY DISTRICT.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:59.101 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLE FUNDING DESPITE THE

01:23:56.164 --> 01:24:02.104 region:rollup2
FACT THAT WE HAVE VERY VERY.

01:23:59.101 --> 01:24:04.506 region:rollup2
STRONG METRICS FOR STUDENT

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:05.407 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AND I'M CONCERNED

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.975 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.910 region:rollup2
DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.744 region:rollup2
STUDENT I JUST MENTIONED THANK

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:12.814 region:rollup2
YOU SO MUCH.

01:24:08.744 --> 01:24:14.483 region:rollup2
THANK YOU PRESIDENT.

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:16.485 region:rollup2
GOOD EVENING I'M JIM REMAIN WITH

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:17.753 region:rollup2
THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND I AM

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
TREASURER ELECT.

01:24:17.753 --> 01:24:21.423 region:rollup2
SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.758 region:rollup2
ABOUT GUIDED PATHWAYS SO FIRST

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.126 region:rollup2
OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:25.594 region:rollup2
SPENDING YOUR LATE AFTERNOON

01:24:24.126 --> 01:24:26.762 region:rollup2
EARLY EVENING AND WITH YOUR

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:28.297 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:30.699 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:32.367 region:rollup2
THE GUIDED PATHWAYS PLANS HAVE

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:33.802 region:rollup2
JUST BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:35.570 region:rollup2
COLLEGES BY THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:37.306 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY WERE DUE

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.640 region:rollup2
ON MARCH THIRTIETH.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:40.075 region:rollup2
A GUIDED PATHWAYS ARE IN THE

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.311 region:rollup2
VERY BEGINNING OF STAGES AND MAY

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:44.146 region:rollup2
TAKE A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS IN

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.314 region:rollup2
AS MANY AS TEN YEARS TO BE FULLY

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:47.049 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED AT OUR HUNDRED

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:48.283 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN COLLEGES.

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:50.552 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T SEE HOW OUTCOMES

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:52.487 region:rollup2
BASED FUNDING IS SUPPORTED BY

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:54.957 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS AT THIS TIME.

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:56.391 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO DATA SUPPORTING THIS.

01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.926 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE WE HAVE EVIDENCE

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:59.528 region:rollup2
THAT OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING DOES

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:01.496 region:rollup2
NOT INCREASED DEGREE AND

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:02.998 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT.

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:04.933 region:rollup2
YES THE CURRENT MODEL ISN'T

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:06.768 region:rollup2
WORKING BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:09.705 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WILL EITHER.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:10.706 region:rollup2
BUT MORE FULL TIME TEACHERS DOES

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:15.377 region:rollup2
WORK THANK YOU.

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:17.012 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:25:15.377 --> 01:25:18.246 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:19.982 region:rollup2
ADDRESS YOU TODAY HAVE UP MY

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.816 region:rollup2
NAME IS DIANE BRADY ON THE VICE

01:25:19.982 --> 01:25:22.918 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:25.087 region:rollup2
SERVICES AT LOS PROCEEDS COLLEGE

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:26.622 region:rollup2
IN EAST BAY. UP I ALSO WANT TO

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:28.557 region:rollup2
EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:29.591 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:31.193 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA AS IT'S

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:32.628 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PROPOSED.

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:33.895 region:rollup2
SOME SIMULATIONS REVEAL THAT

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:35.263 region:rollup2
MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.964 region:rollup2
COLLEGES STATEWIDE WOULD

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:38.033 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE A CUT IN THEIR

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:40.268 region:rollup2
FUNDING. IN MANY CASES THE CUP

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:40.902 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MORE SEVERE THAN WHAT

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:42.037 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGES EXPERIENCE DURING

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:43.305 region:rollup2
THE GREAT RECESSION A FEW YEARS

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:45.574 region:rollup2
AGO.

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:46.641 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION I WOULD LIKE TO

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:49.077 region:rollup2
MAKE THE POINT THAT THE.

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:50.879 region:rollup2
THE ASSERTION THAT THE COLLEGE

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:52.748 region:rollup2
BUDGETS WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:54.316 region:rollup2
IS MISLEADING IN THAT EVEN CALL

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:55.851 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO THOSE

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:57.152 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WE WOULD BE HELD

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:58.754 region:rollup2
HARMLESS AT THE SEVENTEEN

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.922 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN RATE WHILE COSTS ARE

01:25:58.754 --> 01:26:02.591 region:rollup2
RISING FOR. UTILITIES AND

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:04.893 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT AND OTHER THINGS WE

01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:06.728 region:rollup2
WOULD RECEIVE CALL A AND THAT

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:08.630 region:rollup2
WAS ESSENTIALLY A PAY CUT.

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:09.698 region:rollup2
OF AND EVEN WORSE THE FORMULA

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.400 region:rollup2
FAILS TO HELP THE STUDENTS WHO

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:12.501 region:rollup2
NEED US THE MOST IN THE SENSE

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.436 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:16.171 region:rollup2
PART TIME. WE HAVE MORE THAN

01:26:14.436 --> 01:26:17.739 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:19.141 region:rollup2
ARE ATTENDING PART TIME. OR THEY

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:20.075 region:rollup2
ON SUCCESSFUL IF THEY DON'T

01:26:19.141 --> 01:26:21.043 region:rollup2
REACH THEIR GOALS IN TWO OR

01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:22.711 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS BECAUSE IT TAKES

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:23.812 region:rollup2
THEM LONGER MORE THAN SIXTY

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:25.514 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:27.482 region:rollup2
WORK MORE THAN TWENTY HOURS A

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.850 region:rollup2
WEEK. UP AND I WOULDN'T CALL

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:30.185 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS UNSUCCESSFUL

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.253 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET OUT IN

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:32.554 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE YEARS.

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:33.889 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.790 region:rollup2
IN THE STUDENT THE VISION FOR

01:26:33.889 --> 01:26:37.025 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:38.827 region:rollup2
IT SAID GOAL SHOULD BE USED TO

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:40.762 region:rollup2
MOTIVATE AND PROVIDE DIRECTION

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:42.030 region:rollup2
NOT PUNISH.

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:44.499 region:rollup2
THIS FORMULA'S IT'S WRITTEN

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:46.268 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS SEVERELY PUNITIVE.

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:46.802 region:rollup2
I WOULD URGE THAT YOU PLEASE

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.437 region:rollup2
TAKE THE TIME TO STUDY IT

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:50.472 region:rollup2
LONGER.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:52.441 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING

01:26:50.472 --> 01:26:54.743 region:rollup2
FORMULA THAT WE DO COME UP.

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:55.711 region:rollup2
MEETS THE INTENT THERE IS A

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:57.813 region:rollup2
LAUDABLE INTENT BUT.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:59.715 region:rollup2
STILL MAINTAINS.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.650 region:rollup2
STABLE AND PREDICTABLE FUNDING

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:05.387 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY HARMING

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:07.055 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THANK YOU.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:08.056 region:rollup2
GOOD EVENING JENNIFER BAKER WITH

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.957 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:11.259 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:12.761 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THE GOLD THAT.

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.628 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:15.130 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE AND WE THINK IT'S A LOT

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:17.199 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL HERE TO TRY TO HAVE A

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:19.334 region:rollup2
STABLE FORMULA PARTICULARLY

01:27:17.199 --> 01:27:20.735 region:rollup2
THROUGH TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:22.104 region:rollup2
THEIR QUESTION THAT WE WOULD

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.971 region:rollup2
ASK REGARDING THE FIRST FIFTY

01:27:22.104 --> 01:27:25.507 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:27.175 region:rollup2
IS IS THAT ENOUGH BASED ON THE

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:29.211 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD ON

01:27:27.175 --> 01:27:30.846 region:rollup2
THE K. TWELVE SIDE WE REALIZED

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:32.347 region:rollup2
INITIALLY WHEN THE LC FF WAS

01:27:30.846 --> 01:27:33.748 region:rollup2
CREATED. THE THOUGHT WAS THAT

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:35.650 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:37.819 region:rollup2
LONG TERM SYSTEMIC COST THAT THE

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:39.421 region:rollup2
SYSTEM NEEDED IN AS MANY OF YOU

01:27:37.819 --> 01:27:41.389 region:rollup2
KNOW TO OTHER CONVERSATIONS WERE

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:42.991 region:rollup2
FINDING OUT NOW THAT WE HAVE TO

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:45.060 region:rollup2
DO SOME WHATEVER REVENGE. SO THE

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:47.095 region:rollup2
QUESTION WE WE'D LIKE TO POSE

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:48.396 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.865 region:rollup2
IS FIFTY PERCENT GOING TO BE OUT

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:52.501 region:rollup2
NOW FOR THE LONG TERM SYSTEMIC

01:27:49.865 --> 01:27:53.769 region:rollup2
IMPACTS IN COST INCREASES THAT

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:55.470 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:56.905 region:rollup2
TO HAVE OVER THE YEARS WE THINK

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:58.874 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE A VERY THOUGHTFUL

01:27:56.905 --> 01:28:00.575 region:rollup2
FISCAL PROCESS TO ANALYZE THAT

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:01.910 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT BASE NUMBER IS

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:03.245 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE. ENOUGH.

01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:04.746 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE

01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:05.480 region:rollup2
CONCERNS SET UP A REYES

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:07.749 region:rollup2
REGARDING.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.751 region:rollup2
DUH HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION FOR

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.585 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR WE WOULD ASK IS THAT

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.720 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.221 region:rollup2
AND WOOD OF THE IN THE

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.223 region:rollup2
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:16.024 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS BECAUSE WE'VE

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:18.426 region:rollup2
SEEN SIMILAR.

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:20.095 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES ON THE KEY TWELVE

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:22.531 region:rollup2

INITIAL STUDENT.

GRANT TO HELP STUDENTS IN NEED

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:28.236 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:29.571 region:rollup2
VERY VERY REFLECTIVE COMMENTS

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:31.406 region:rollup2

FIVE PERCENT GRANT.

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.830 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA TALK VERY LONG

01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:30.565 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.499 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULD HAVE ON YOUR DESK OUR

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:33.969 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:35.170 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CONSTITUTES THIRD OF

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:36.371 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTUALLY

01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:38.206 region:rollup2
DEAN THIS CAME OUT JUST THIS

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:41.443 region:rollup2
PAST MONDAY I JUST A COUPLE

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:42.878 region:rollup2
THINGS I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IN AND.

01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:44.412 region:rollup2
SINCE THIS JUST CAME OUT MONDAY

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:46.414 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DESIRE TO HAVE

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:47.482 region:rollup2
CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS BUT.

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:50.619 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING A

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:52.821 region:rollup2
LOT ABOUT IS INSTITUTIONAL

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:54.322 region:rollup2
CAPACITY SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMO

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:54.890 region:rollup2
AND YOU ASKED THE KEY QUESTION

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.926 region:rollup2
WHICH I'M NOT TO BE ABLE TO

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:59.561 region:rollup2
ANSWER. BUT ABSENT INSTITUTIONAL

01:29:57.926 --> 01:30:01.096 region:rollup2
CAPACITY

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:03.098 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:30:01.096 --> 01:30:04.933 region:rollup2
SERVE I ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:06.635 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:08.003 region:rollup2
AND MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS SO

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:10.138 region:rollup2
IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:12.107 region:rollup2
CEO WORK GROUP. THERE IS.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:14.309 region:rollup2
A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:16.144 region:rollup2
BASS ALLOCATION RESOURCE AND

01:30:14.309 --> 01:30:17.946 region:rollup2
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NOT

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.847 region:rollup2
JUST FOR A NEW FUNDING FORMULA

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:20.749 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH IT'S CRITICAL FOR

01:30:18.847 --> 01:30:21.816 region:rollup2
PACKAGES SO THAT WE CAN. I DO

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:24.085 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO EQUITY

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:26.054 region:rollup2
MINDED APPROACH TO TO FUNDING.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:27.989 region:rollup2
AND ALSO YOU'LL SEE IN THE IN

01:30:26.054 --> 01:30:30.358 region:rollup2
THE REPORT THAT THERE IS A PHASE

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:32.594 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S RECOMMENDED IN THIS

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:33.995 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO THANK YOU. SO MISTER

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:35.730 region:rollup2
GLAZE YES IF YOU COULDN'T MAYBE

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:37.232 region:rollup2
HANG OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:39.067 region:rollup2
YOU YOU ARE.

01:30:37.232 --> 01:30:40.902 region:rollup2
KEY QUESTION IS THAT.

01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:42.704 region:rollup2
WE WE HEARD IN THE LETTER FROM

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:44.572 region:rollup2
EL CAMINO RECEIVED A PHONE CALL

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:46.141 region:rollup2
FROM TO DISTRICTS OUTSIDE OF MY

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:47.442 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WE HEARD FROM THE

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:48.777 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT SHOULD BOW AND.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:51.313 region:rollup2
AND YOU REPRESENT HUNDRED

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:52.847 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN.

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:54.349 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHAT'S UNDER

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
IT HUNDRED FOURTEEN YOUR FOR

01:30:54.349 --> 01:30:57.218 region:rollup2
COLLEGES COLLEGES.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.620 region:rollup2
AND HUNDRED FOUR DIFFERENT

01:30:57.218 --> 01:31:01.623 region:rollup2
OPINIONS BUT.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:02.624 region:rollup2
SOME VERY VOCAL VOICES SAYING.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.391 region:rollup2
TOO FAST TOO MANY UNANSWERED

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:05.160 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:07.329 region:rollup2
.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.430 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT EVEN SLOW DOWN BUT

01:31:07.329 --> 01:31:10.265 region:rollup2
THAT THE WAY YOU'RE GOING JUST

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:13.134 region:rollup2
DOESN'T QUITE WORK.

01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:14.903 region:rollup2
SO. HOW COULD THE LEAK?

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:17.138 region:rollup2
IT IN IT THE CAPACITY.

01:31:14.903 --> 01:31:18.907 region:rollup2
GO FORWARD WHENWHEN HERE'S

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:20.775 region:rollup2
SOME MUCH DISSENT.

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:22.077 region:rollup2
FROM YEAR ON FROM YOUR MEMBERS

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:24.079 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA RIGHT IT I AM

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:26.047 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR. OUT AND AS YOU'LL

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:28.483 region:rollup2
SEE IN THE REPORT THE CEO

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:30.051 region:rollup2
WORKGROUP IS NOT SAYING. I WE

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:32.287 region:rollup2
ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT SUPPORTIVE

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:34.489 region:rollup2
OF THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK AND

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:36.057 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AS AN AND I THINK.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.058 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDABLY THERE WAS A VERY

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:38.893 region:rollup2
STRONG REACTION TO THAT

01:31:37.058 --> 01:31:40.662 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IN THE

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:42.263 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK AND THEN ONCE THE

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:43.932 region:rollup2
SIMULATIONS CAME OUT.

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:46.768 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A LOT OF DAMAGE

01:31:43.932 --> 01:31:48.136 region:rollup2
DISEASE STRIKES SO THE CEO WORK

01:31:46.768 --> 01:31:50.271 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT FRAMEWORK.

01:31:48.136 --> 01:31:52.240 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:54.976 region:rollup2
KEYS THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS THAT

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.644 region:rollup2
MIGHT PROVIDE. A OUTCOMES BASED

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:57.545 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:59.748 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S PHASED AND

01:31:57.545 --> 01:32:02.617 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE GREAT DIVERSITY

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:03.818 region:rollup2
AMONGST OUR CEOS JUST AS WE HAVE

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:05.854 region:rollup2
GREAT DIVERSITY UP AT THE

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:08.089 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND SO. ON.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:09.391 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:11.726 region:rollup2
THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:32:09.391 --> 01:32:14.662 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:16.531 region:rollup2
SOME SPECIFICITY ALTHOUGH. IT'S

01:32:14.662 --> 01:32:18.733 region:rollup2
CLEARLY I AM.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.668 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE THIS WOULD

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:22.904 region:rollup2
PROVIDE HARDING UNLESS ESTATE

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:25.673 region:rollup2
FURTHER COMMUNICATION SO.

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:27.709 region:rollup2
WE THE WORKGROUP HAS TRIED TO

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:30.211 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE IT EVERY STEP OF THE

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:31.846 region:rollup2
WAY BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:33.415 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN A YOU KNOW ENOUGH IN

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:35.183 region:rollup2
A MONTH'S TIME SO THAT'S WHY

01:32:33.415 --> 01:32:36.918 region:rollup2
THOUGH IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:32:35.183 --> 01:32:38.086 region:rollup2
IT'S A PHASED IN PROCESS AND THE

01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:40.021 region:rollup2
KEY IS.

01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:41.756 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CALL OR THE WORKGROUP

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:44.025 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AN OVERSIGHT COUNCIL?

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:45.693 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD DO AN ANALYSIS IN

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:47.295 region:rollup2
CONTINUAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE IF

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:48.763 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:50.565 region:rollup2
THEY ALL HAVE SOME KIND OF A

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:51.833 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT LOOKS AT UNINTENDED

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:53.601 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES HOW DO WE CHANGE

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:55.136 region:rollup2
THE HYDRAULICS. SO WE'RE TALKING

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:57.038 region:rollup2
ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF A LONGER

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:58.473 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION IN LAST QUESTION

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:00.875 region:rollup2
EIGHT WORK IT IS TO US BUT.

01:32:58.473 --> 01:33:03.812 region:rollup2
BUT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:04.846 region:rollup2
LC FF IN QUAKE IN CAPE TWELVE.

01:33:03.812 --> 01:33:06.481 region:rollup2
THE MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION

01:33:04.846 --> 01:33:07.649 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:09.484 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO OFTEN SOME OF THAT

01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:11.519 region:rollup2
THE DESCENT SO DO YOU THINK THAT

01:33:09.484 --> 01:33:12.987 region:rollup2
THAT THAT KIND OF FORMULA THAT

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:15.390 region:rollup2
YOU OUTLINED HERE AND

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:17.358 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE STATE.

01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:19.127 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION WILL MITIGATE SOME

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:21.362 region:rollup2
OF THAT CONCERNS FROM ACROSS

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:22.864 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:24.866 region:rollup2
I THINK THE WORK GROUP BELIEVES

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:27.769 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN THERE WAS A CONCERN

01:33:24.866 --> 01:33:28.837 region:rollup2
ABOUT TIME IN DOING ANALYSIS SO.

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.839 region:rollup2
THAT SO.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:33.007 region:rollup2
THE.

01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:35.276 region:rollup2
I I GUESS THE ANSWER IS ABSENT

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:37.312 region:rollup2
SIMULATIONS AND EVEN WEEK WE

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:39.848 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN SIMULATIONS ARE OF.

01:33:37.312 --> 01:33:41.816 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF APPROACH ABSENT

01:33:39.848 --> 01:33:43.518 region:rollup2
SIMULATIONS WE WON'T KNOW I GET

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:46.454 region:rollup2
I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT.

01:33:43.518 --> 01:33:48.423 region:rollup2
WHO IS THAT ARE WE COUNTING ON?

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:50.225 region:rollup2
CERTAIN REVENUE GROWTH AND

01:33:48.423 --> 01:33:52.060 region:rollup2
PROPPING IT OVER LIKE A FIVE SIX

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:54.262 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD. THAT WILL MAKE IT

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.897 region:rollup2
PALATABLE AND WITHOUT THAT WHO

01:33:54.262 --> 01:33:57.465 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS.

01:33:55.897 --> 01:33:59.934 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK REGARDLESS OF THE

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.935 region:rollup2
FORMULA YOU HAVE IF WE HAVE SOME

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.704 region:rollup2
KIND OF A SEVERE PROBLEM BUT.

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:03.838 region:rollup2
.

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:05.707 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE THERE ARE NO

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:08.676 region:rollup2
SIMULATIONS IN HERE SO WE DON'T

01:34:05.707 --> 01:34:10.311 region:rollup2
KNOW THE EXACT IMPACTS BUT.

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:11.946 region:rollup2
YOU NEED SOME KIND OF BASE

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:14.649 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:16.150 region:rollup2
FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:18.920 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS.

01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:20.054 region:rollup2
YES WE NEED TO INCREASE THE

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.623 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF OF THE

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:24.659 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:26.694 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA TO

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:27.795 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED SO ME JUST A

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:29.264 region:rollup2
REALLY QUICK EXAMPLE WITHOUT

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:30.899 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND SOME

01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:32.133 region:rollup2
OF OUR SMALLER COLLEGES DON'T

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.835 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:35.203 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH. YOU CAN

01:34:33.835 --> 01:34:36.571 region:rollup2
DO THE DATA FORMED ANALYSIS THAT

01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:37.872 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD NEED TO DO TO LOOKING

01:34:36.571 --> 01:34:39.741 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION AND FIGURE OUT HOW

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:39.908 region:rollup2
CAN WE.

01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:41.843 region:rollup2
I.

01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:43.978 region:rollup2
YEAH CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:46.447 region:rollup2
SOUTH.

01:34:43.978 --> 01:34:47.315 region:rollup2
AND I THINK APPS REGARDLESS OF

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:48.850 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR

01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:50.185 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY THERE

01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:51.419 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE. AT A BASE

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:53.454 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION INCREASE FOR THE

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:55.089 region:rollup2
COLLEGES SPREAD THE COSTS AND

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:55.823 region:rollup2
AND TO SERVE.

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:56.357 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE IT'S

01:34:55.823 --> 01:35:00.995 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:35:02.730 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:04.032 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DEEPLY

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.471 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH THE PURPOSE WITH

THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL.

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:13.374 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT FACT IS ACTUALLY
