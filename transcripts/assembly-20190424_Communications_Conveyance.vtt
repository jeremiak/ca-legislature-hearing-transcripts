THE CALLER.

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.369
BUT THE ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.171

AND REALLY I WANT TO START WITH

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.935
A PERSONAL STORY TO EMPHASIZE

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:39.138
THIS MY SON FELL AND HURT

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.706
HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS JUMPING ON

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:41.573

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.976

THE WINDOW SILL.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.480
HE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND I

WAS TRYING TO GRAB A TOWEL AND

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.017
HOLD IT TO HIS BLEEDING HEAD

DEVICE TO CALL.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.425

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:02.361
TIMES BAY HUNG UP ON ME.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:03.996
AND I FINALLY HAD TO GIVE UP

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:06.498
GRAB MY SON AND RUSHED HIM OFF

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.966
TO THE HOSPITAL ON MY OWN.

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.436

AND SAID THAT THEY HAD STOPPED

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.450

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:26.952

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:36.981
THAT DEREGULATION WOULD CAUSE

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.716
IMPACTS ON PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:39.651
IT'S A CLARA COUNTY'S COUNCIL A

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:40.185

AMENDMENT THAT HAD SOME --

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.157
LANGUAGE BUT WHICH WAS VERY

00:31:33.224 --> 00:31:35.026
TROUBLING AT THE BEGINNING --

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.261
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO THINK THAT

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:38.429
THERE ARE SOME SPECIFICS IN HERE

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:39.030
WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK

ON THE EMERGENCY TRIGGER HOW

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:45.870
WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY --

HOW ARE THEY NOTIFIED WHEN THERE

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.540
IS AN EMERGENCY -- IF IT'S A

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:52.343
VERY LOCALIZED SITUATION -- THAT

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:56.014
CREATES COMPLICATIONS -- THE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.548
INDUSTRY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND AND

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:58.716
KNOW.

00:31:58.783 --> 00:32:00.652
WHEN AND WHERE THEIR OBLIGATIONS

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:03.087
OF APPLY -- AND I THINK THAT

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:04.822
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD LIKE

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:05.590
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MISTER

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:08.559

THINK IMPAIR INTEGRATE IMPAIR OR

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:13.131
DEGRADE DOES HAVE SOME -- HAVE --

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.899
HAS SOME AMBIGUITY TO IT IT'S

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.734
NOT NECESSARILY THE IMPAIRED TO

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.603
GREAT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.771
THAT NEUTRALITY AGAIN AS THE

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.039
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT WHICH IS THE

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.341
IMPAIR DEGREE BECAUSE OF CONTENT

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:25.910
THIS HAS TO DO WITH DATA -- SO

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:27.445
FOR THOSE REASONS.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.914
WE ARE A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:36.187
IS A I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:39.324

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.961

SOMETHING THAT -- WE SUPPORT --

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.799
WE THINK THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.768
FOR A CONFUSION WITH -- C. C. P.

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.703

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.473
THE CALIFORNIA -- CONSUMER

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.246
WARRIOR ON THAT DONE ON A ON A

CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:46.417
THINK THAT TO SOME ISSUES THERE

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:49.386
THAT WE'D LIKE.

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:49.987

WE ALSO WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.824
TO CONSIDER.

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.826
THAT IT SHOULD BE THE WALKED AND

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:59.630
NOT THE WHO THAT IS BEING --

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:01.732
DEALT WITH HERE -- THERE ARE

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:02.867
OTHER.

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:05.770
TECHNOLOGIES THAT USE THE SAME

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:08.205
TYPE OF INFORMATION -- CELL SITE

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:10.241
INFORMATION LIKE THIS IS THE GPS

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:13.144
AND THE LIKE -- AND WE THINK

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.813
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.916
ALL THE DATA THAT'S SIMILARLY

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:21.118

YOU GET THE THEN I THINK THAT

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.147
THE OTHER POINT OF CONFUSION IS

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:50.781
THAT IT IT IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.616

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:57.822
COULD RESULT FROM THIS WE

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.785
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING FOR

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.320
THE PUBLIC IS BECAUSE SOME OF

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:31.955
THE ISSUES YOU'VE TALKED TO US

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:32.923
ABOUT AND BILLS YOU BROUGHT

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.258
FORWARD.

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:36.226
RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.861
MANY OTHERS.

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.530
IS THEY HAVE ABOUT.

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:40.964
A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.767
INFORMATION OF RELATED TO WHAT

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.035
THEY'RE GIVING OUT AND WHAT'S

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.370
BEING USED.

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.739
SO I THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY --

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.841
EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:53.110
PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.680
PERHAPS THROUGH -- OUR DISTRICT

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:58.615
OFFICES WE COULD HOLD SOME --

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:02.319
SOME TYPE OF INFORMATIONAL --

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.854
AND WORKSHOPS ON THAT.

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.489
SO THAT'S JUST A COMMENT ON IT

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:08.659
BECAUSE THIS ISRAEL AREA IN

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:11.328
FULLER TEN OF NOT TOO LONG AGO

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.930
ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS AGO --

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:14.464
THERE WAS A CASE OF THAT THE

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.966
POLICE WERE INVOLVED THROUGH CAL

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:28.178
ON A LINE KNOWING WHERE THEY

00:47:28.245 --> 00:47:29.079
WERE.

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:31.215
NOT GOING AFTER THEM BUT GOING

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.549
TO WHERE THEY LIVED.

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:34.751
AND WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.987

00:47:46.263 --> 00:47:48.098
AND THEY PUT THE INFORMATION

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:49.733
TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.635
THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVICT HIM OF

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.836

BUT OF THE GIRLS ACTUALLY.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.918
IT WAS SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:08.411
THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS -- TO

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:12.315

INFORMATION TO YOUR LOCATION --

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.456
I THINK AT THE DIFFERENCES

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:22.325
BETWEEN -- GENERAL GEOLOCATION

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.194
IMPRECISE YOUR LOCATION -- IN

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.762
THIS INSTANCE I THINK WHAT THEY

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.263
DO IS THEY CAN TAKE THAT AND%

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.666
THEN ADD MORE INTO A TO TO TRACK

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.234
TO TRACK THE INDIVIDUAL BUT I

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:32.469
THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:36.940
QUESTION -- LET ME GO FURTHER ON

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.608

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:39.042
OKAY.

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.076
AND AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.778
THAT THE F. C. C.'S THAT THAT IS

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:44.447
THE CASE OF BUT THE FCC IS NOT

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:46.216
ENFORCING IT [inaudible]

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:48.151
ALL RIGHT.

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.686
I AM LAST QUESTION WOULD BE

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:50.720
CONCERNING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.921
ACTION WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:53.423
NORMALLY NOT A BIG FAN OF

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.858
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE SAY THAT

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.526
SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL WE HAVE AN

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:57.427
ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT SHOULD BE

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:58.495
ENFORCING THAT.

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.530
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF LARGE

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:02.065
CLASSES OF CONSUMERS AND I'D

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.967
RATHER LEAVE IT WITH THAT AGENCY

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.903
THEY ON CREATE A POSSIBLE PROFIT

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.239
MOTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO AFTER --

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:10.874
SO IN THIS CASE THAT'S THAT'S

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.841
SOMETHING THAT MITIGATES IN MY

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.276
OPINION AGAINST THE BILL BUT I

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:14.644

THINGS INTO THIS BILL THAT THAT

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.790

ACTUALLY THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING --

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:11.039
IT IS GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:12.407
FOR THE WORKERS IN THE CONSUMERS

JUST THIS IDEA OF REGULATION BUT

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:21.115
WE AS LEGISLATORS I THINK I'M

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:22.584
FAR BETTER POSITION TO

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.053

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:26.221
