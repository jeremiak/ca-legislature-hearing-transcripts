all for being here welcome to our informational hearing being conducted by the joint legislative committee on emergency management and the assembly select committee on natural disaster response recovery and rebuilding today's discussion will be on the alert strengthening California's public warning systems I do have an opening statement -- but before I read that I I feel compelled to make the following statement Carpinteria California which less the or a little over a year ago I guess it was less than a year ago -- we suffer through what was that at the time the worst wildfire in history California -- it started December fourth during our so called off season and burned for forty days moving up from Santa Paula in Ventura county to past where we are right now ending up over monta Seto in next to the city Santa Barbara and of course -- resulting in a debris flow two weeks later they killed twenty three people we have since that period of time we are no longer the worst -- or the largest fired wildfire in California history we've been superseded now on several occasions just within the last twelve months so it makes us ask the question of what is going on and frankly it's really tragic that we're here today to discuss how to deal with raging wildfires that have become the new abnormal in our state these fires have snuffed out lives of over a hundred and fifty Californians in the past year alone destroyed homes and property in the hopes and dreams of thousands our failure to listen to the plaintive cry of mother nature that we are warming our natural climate creating severe and dramatic changes in our weather leading to extreme drought winds and conditions that have now led us to the point we're at here today and even after in undisputed bull scientific study was released trust this past week national leaders continue to foolishly did not hide the challenging conditions of our planet recklessly and irresponsibly blaming those they do not like for something that is obviously occurring as a result of human behavior all that aside we are here and today we meet at the epicenter of one of these disasters the Thomas fire again it occurred not even a year ago and which has been supplanted over the past several months by larger fires by more deadly fires fires that have existed during our so called rainy season and so here we are so with the state of California come together to try to find ways to reverse this threat to our communities and as governor brown has referred to it as the existential crisis of our time he is not wrong and I ask how many times does mother nature have to hit us in the face with a two by four for us to start recognizing that we must change the way we work and live and provide within our communities this is going to continue unless we immediately recognize our behavior is creating the circumstances that have led to these fires in these deaths and so we are here today to work to protect our people our property our communities by focusing on this is issue a public warning systems it is not going to fix the problem we must try to fix the problem but in the interim we are here working on waste that we can protect our communities it is our responsibility is government it is our responsibility as human beings living on this planet and it's one that we must start to take more seriously and act more dramatically while we figure out ways in the interim to protect the people who make up our great state and with that I'd like to wish you all good morning and the thank a first the the city of carbon rear for hosting this event here -- in their city hall the cut the discussion today will be our on public warning systems I'm senator Hannah Beth Jackson I represent this magnificent area the nineteen state Senate district which is all of Santa Barbara county and the western portion of inter county and like my colleague assembly member Monique Limon every member of the Thomas fire burned within our respective districts so we understand and appreciate the magnitude of this problem I am here also with assembly member Marc Levine who service along with assembly member thing known as co chairs of the assembly -- committee on disaster response recovering and rebuilding he represents a nice area the tenth assembly district in Marin and Sonoma counties and of course -- has similar experiences -- that -- he has had to address in his tenure as well and Dodd like to well I'll give a warm welcome to all of you were here our distinguished witnesses and guess who travels for throughout the state to to be with us here in Carpinteria to provide us with their expertise -- so that we can work to improve a system which we have been working to improve we made great strides last year -- but we still have work to do we have a lot of work to do in this area any others to try to remove -- to improve our responses -- to these horrific conditions which have created such damage and destruction throughout our state -- the we have -- papers in the back the -- that include a variety of materials and the -- agenda for today also available online for those -- watching today's hearing remotely at emergency management dot Senate dot CA dot gov that's emergency management dot Senate dot CA dot gov in if years older so I am you wonder what the heck did you just say but there it is we're going to get a good response the public needs to understand what we're doing we need input we will at the end of our hearing a lot for brief public comment but this is just the beginning of the conversation -- our witnesses come from emergency management offices across the state representing both urban and rural northern and southern California regions and many of us who are many of those who are here today and I want to thank you are fresh off emergency assignments -- in their home jurisdictions or deployments elsewhere throughout the state which is an extraordinary -- system that we have here in California which is responsible for doing the extraordinary job in dealing with these horrific fires reducing the potential loss of life -- is significantly as we have and putting out some of these fires that would otherwise continue to rage on perhaps indefinitely -- we have -- also a Louisiana and seen this the bilingual public outreach coordinator for the city of Santa Barbara fire department to is here with us today we have issues said I know assembly member Limon will mention them -- dealing with making sure that all our population gets appropriate messages in languages that they are able to understand -- when we have the significant events I remember when we had the -- Thomas fire it was translated as the hair brush fire and obviously when I hear brushes on fire you're not quite is concerned some -- detrimental impacts as a result of that poor interpretation that -- that was submitted to the community for being here she's a state coordinator for the least those program -- her name doesn't appear on the agenda but she will take part in the next steps panel toward the end of the hearing this is the third hearing in a series examining our emergency public warning systems ironically last year on December fourth we held I think was our first hearing on the subject after the tubs fire in the Sonoma fires -- to talk about that system little did I know that an hour and a half after banging down the gavel saying hopefully we have a little rest but it's December together some of these best practices that an hour and a half later the Thomas fire started -- an irony that will never leave me -- we have as I mentioned fourth on March seventh the committee held a second hearing focused on California's decision to opt into the first net public safety network managed -- by the federal national telecommunications and information administration -- we will perhaps have further discussion about the various different programs and systems that are available but the goal of these two hearings was to educate state policymakers on how these two categories of emergency communications networks functioned and to identify areas for improvement of I believe it was for -- pieces of legislation last year we will be discussing of legislation are being implemented and -- we will proceed with that discussion here in just a couple minutes we do know there is more work to be done to create a more robust reliable and effective network a public warning systems across the state and as we know the stakes cannot be higher so -- rather than go through the various fires that we've had in the past twelve months some of which are literally still smoldering -- we're we're trying to wreck -- identify the remains of those who but in addition to now the eighty eight who lost their lives at the campfire -- in others and the will see fire -- in all the other tragedies that we've been suffering we have work to do -- we have to move forward we have to try on a national level to the extent possible as well as within our state to everything we can to protect the public which is our primary responsibility is government so with that -- I'd like to invite my co chairs to offer an opening statement and -- also have a -- statement from assembly member Gallagher and if one of you would like to read that as well you may note he is the is assembly member in the area of the -- campfire in office he was unable to join us today so Mister culture toss it over to my colleague -- assembly member Monique Limon thank you thank you all of you for being here and and those watching online or at home -- a think as is been said it we had a thought about gathering and having this conversation independent of what's happened over the last month and the fires -- in primarily it was our chance and ability to reassess where we've been a number of when we first had a hearing in our district I think you know several months ago we we shared the dozens of bills that had moved forward -- related to and natural disaster response emergency notifications -- and there after everything that that that comes thereafter related to recovery and -- meal we've learned in California that even the fires that we talked about -- a year ago that we lived in experience -- are all identical and that on -- our abilities as human beings on science to give us directions -- about what to do and how to do things that there are the magnitude of what we've lived -- in the state of California -- has grown to an extent that we didn't really think was possible we thought that even with these laws in place -- and knowing the direction we wanted to go into -- it would certainly help I want to be clear that the laws that we put in place the are the hearings that we have do help the do you aid in the situation remedy to these fires isn't nearly impossible -- I think those of us that represent these areas know that and now I see the coalition of members who represent impacted areas growing -- and he needs a coalition that we worry about how fast it's growing we now have more members -- throughout the state of California that are feeling the impact of of these wild fire specifically and that is a concern to us but what we're here to do today is also to listen to what has worked on what one maybe hasn't work what we need to change and to accept the fact that this is an evolving conversation that we don't necessarily have a magic bullet at once but that we assess and that we come together from experts -- who are on the ground -- dealing with some of the emergency to those of us that are thinking more about the the impact of laws and what things need to change and and how we think about this so I want to thank my colleagues on for being here -- regrettably we've all had very first hand experience -- with this and also think everyone else for being here all of those of you that are going to testify -- I feel like we were becoming friends that very quickly because we keep seeing each other -- the because there's so much happening in our community but this is an opportunity to take back what we learned what we discussed today to accept that things are going to be involving and that we may not have a magic bullet but also at to recognize that both the state assembly and the state Senate are committed to this this is why you see a joint hearing -- I do believe that will have another US senator joining us and you know at about ten thirty or so and and -- a do you want to share the statement -- from Gallagher who of there's print had on my phone and that from our colleague James Gallagher James Gallagher assembly member James Gallagher represents -- the city as the communities of paradise and couldn't be here today but I think yeah his statement is is very important at to hear and to get on record colleagues it is with great sadness and shared grief with my community that I have to report of yet another tragic wildfire cleaning the lives and property of Californians after last year's fires I hoped it couldn't get worse it has I never could have found them that my district would be the site of the deadliest wildfire in California history we are up to eighty eight people confirmed dead and over fifteen thousand structures destroyed the communities of không cal paradise Mongolia have been disseminated but as many of you on the select committee know all too well devastating wildfire is and has been an imminent threat in California and in recent years due to the drought high fuel levels low moisture and ever increasing high winds have become an even more deadly had become even more deadly for our communities this fire moves faster than anyone could have imagined it started in a remote area off highway seventy into rain that was extremely difficult to reach by firefighters it was quickly blown to fifty miles per hour winds and within two short hours had blazed through the communities of con cal jumped to canyons and was already lightning lighting fires in the community of paradise quite simply no one expected it to move this fast respond hers have likened it unto a flame thrower which shot fiery embers up to a mile from the fire line beginning new spot fires which in turn were blown even further down when I don't pretend to have the answers to how we prevent tragedies like this from happening I know you are discussing warning systems today all I can tell you today is that this happen in communities that were very fire aware that had evacuation plans and strategies in place that had a practice and simulated evacuations and that had led community efforts to get people signed up for warning system like code red the fire move faster than we prepared for in the end we still had people who said they had no notice and we still had traffic jams during evacuation that prevented people from getting to safety fast enough knowing that we had these types of fires to contend with we will mostly we will most definitely need to up our game I am committed as I know you are to finding out how we can do so thank you for your time and attention to this important matter and I look forward to working with you to find the answers in the coming legislative session assembly member James Gallagher with those words I will pass it on to our co chair Marc Levine thank you very much thank you very much a some some number and and senator you all so much for being here and coming -- to this hearing and -- I also think everyone who traveled here to give testimony and provide your expertise cinema really grateful for your leadership in the state as we're going through impacts of climate change above all I'd like to take a moment to recognize on the Los that the state has experienced over the past thirteen or fourteen months and also of the sacrifices of brave women and men across the state who risk their lives to protect us their efforts do not go unnoticed one -- on Wednesday thanksgiving eve I had an opportunity visit the camp fire and see firsthand the faces of displaced residents devastated by yet another wildfire in California assemblymember Gallagher's words -- could not I heard -- on Wednesday night personnel who detailed countless close calls in horror stories from the initial hours of evacuation the devastation is all too reminiscent of the then record setting fires and twenty seventeen -- the effects of which we are still recovering from -- in the North Bay as well as here in not in Santa Barbara and Ventura county all while I have friends and acquaintances who lost their homes in the North Bay fires last year it was the Thomas fire that took at the home of one of my family members here inventor county subsequent year will force us as residents public safety personnel and lawmakers to face an ever changing emergency landscape not only with the threat of fires but mud slides earthquakes floods and other unforeseen disasters and it was earlier this year that I join my colleagues some Amberley known to tore the mud slides of mine a CEO and and see first hand -- how your community was impacted by this we thought that we're doing a lot of work to move our state forward and better prepare ourselves last year but this is something that we will be working on for many years to come as our communities rebuild and we protect our communities from future disaster is my hope that from the discussions that we have today we can learn ways to improve the efficiency and and -- effectiveness of our public warning system so we may mitigate the fear and loss California's face in the event of an emergency thank you thank you Assemblymembers I appreciate your participation and know that you have been actively involved as well in both trying to prevent these events and to the process of recovery in rebuild which will go on for years to come and we're likely to see more these events going forward and will likely hear more stories -- but we're here today to try to do everything we can to improve our system I wanna again thank everyone is here we notice standing room only so I'm appreciative of your interest I know we have representatives of elected officials here I want to just give a shout out to my friend and colleague on the Santa Barbara for supervisors Janet will who is personally present here today thank you for being here I know you lost your home several years ago in the paradise painted cave excuse me painted que fire so you know this affects all of us when we're other whether directly and I know the senator stern will be joining us shortly he lives in the area of the holes he file in my fired my understand is he lost his apartment in that fire as well so without further do I would like to welcome our first three panelists who will provide an overview of recent fires as well as recent changes in state law governing public warning systems again today we're going to focus on the public warning systems how do we let people know is quickly and effectively -- and efficiently as possible -- so that they can get out without a good morning to -- Tom Porter chief strategic planning department of forestry and fire protection Kim's a garish state fire and rescue chief with the governor's office of emergency services and Mike -- medic of itch I get that right close enough deputy director of logistics management with also the governor's office of emergency services Sherman the floor's yours good morning -- air Jackson and low moan -- thank you for having this conversation I'll give -- cam a basic overview I'm not gonna go into detail about the fires in specific terms just because you really have been monitoring that and the public has been monitoring that through the through the media and that is is where the best information is -- but I wanted to reflect on a couple of things -- the climate is changing the fire environment is changing and we are watching that in real time -- with -- what's happening with wild fires -- two thousand seventeen was the worst fire what fire season in California history up until this past month and this month and -- we did have largest fire in California history -- and Mendoza meant Mendocino county and beyond -- and that we is concerning to us but that that fired in Bernie textures didn't kill anybody and of course who we are -- sitting on the heels of of -- the to -- fires that we're really talking about today -- the campfire -- up in county and then the will the fire in in started in Ventura county burned into Los Angeles county but -- to very populated areas and really is is what we're seeing as a as a different -- thing in in the fire environment southern California -- we are we expect fires to move miles in hours -- that's not something that's an and expected we in the northern part of the state have prepared extensively and paradise in particular con cow and some of the most exercised in evacuation planning areas in the northern part of the state we've had bad fires and we know that there are -- road system issues and -- we we so we plan and we have done a lot of fuels work in those in those communities and the camp fire outstripped our planning efforts in sheer time everything was everything would have gone according to our worst case estimates previous to what happened on that morning and is we're watching a climate that that has fire moving in miles per hour state moving north to areas where it hasn't done that before and so -- we are re tooling our our efforts to reflect that that -- condition that we're seeing -- and everything and it's not just the whether it's not just the wind -- or the relative humidity it's it's the extent of the drought the length of time that fuels have been dry up in in -- bird as burning embers in a the column and dropped miles ahead of the fire starting new fires in and around communities that trap people -- that are trying to get out in that direction these are all things that we we are going to be -- working through in the fire environment and the response to fire and so -- that I think in in and of itself is is the one of the biggest challenges that that the fire respond hers and and those that are doing pre fire work as we as we will be continuing under under -- funding under the nine oh one a bill and then also your bill -- senator be helping us to do more of this important work -- and we will continue -- to land for the things that are unexpected which I have just mentioned -- I think it's important to -- add to with the the situation here -- the what happened in monosyllables was mentioned -- with the the debris flows that have followed some of these fires and and our -- watershed emergency response teams are are out on the fires and have developed plans to help with the early warning and and the development of plans to keep people out of the way when those events occur and -- I think the the public -- warning systems and the importance of those forward in all of all of the work that we're doing pro actively and in a response departments -- response -- just to give get people out of the way and I think while we're while the year coalition is growing that is important for the state of California and I believe that is where we need to be going -- as a state we need an informed public so we can keep everybody safe thank you thank you very much you will need your -- right -- hello yeah the maybe we might yeah your yeah -- my real job is to manage the up fire rescue mutual aid system for the upstate a California why I do that it's really an honor and I do it on behalf the California fire service without the California fire service without our law enforcement partners along first mutual aid written to management every other just one sector California would not have the resources to mobilize and surge when necessary for these emergencies and others that will follow I will tell you after last year and a lot of conversation -- one of the things that -- SB nine a one brought us was pre positioning that -- money that was put into Calaveras his budget icon as I refer to my fire chief partners kind of an escrow fund we've got some premonition there and how that money can be used but I can tell you both the fires in the north and the south that -- pre positioning was actually in place -- during that time and -- it least so I can tell you both the camp in the film was a fire resources removed to assist -- because of that particular issue we've been working since last year with California fire chiefs California metro chiefs company prior districts league city fire chiefs conference state firefighters California professional firefighters and the Callaway as fire rescue fire scope -- border directors continue on out of that and has been an easy process to put it together but I would think experience over the last the last number of months in being utilized only for fires but county for potential my debris already and we've also stood up the will be far from Los Angeles county to assist with the with flooding and mud to breeze -- to this point nam Y. retail this -- our hats really should go off to these first responders said to respond each and every day and then their ability to not only provide additional initial tack in that search capacity the goes on and on during the course of -- at least when we hit -- -- the peak and I and I would tell you that -- extremely close together -- on a day to day basis but even more closely at the exact level as -- these fires and other emergencies progressive require a real coordinated approach and we come together under what we call Usagi unified courting group and -- headquarters and statements are putting center to make things come together at the height we mobilize a hundred twenty seven oh yes engines five hundred and forty eight low government engines of about seven or eight six hundred thirty five engines we brought in another two hundred forty four engines through email burden to manage assistance contact at that time given example working organ provided is eighty five engines and all the ten of those engines want to to the camp where the other ten came to southern California watching state provided up forty five -- engines Utah twenty six New Mexico seven Idaho six Montana twenty engines from in so when you look at that -- that was just three mac rather -- cal fires ability to work with our federal partners additional stage brought in at the end by nineteen states provided -- fire resources to assist us in and number degree from engines to some overhead do some hand crews -- during that time -- at the height we put nine her nineteen engines just a mutual aid side not counting cal fire in our federal partners on the fire lines additional eighty three engines were covering fire stations partners little over three thousand six hundred twenty two of firefighting personnel as a as things would just things would have been a almost almost should agree pops for property four hundred engines on both the walls the fire in the Compton the -- and the -- campfire in another about seventy eighty engines on the hill fire spread out those resources throughout the state war was over also all the hills resources removed over the walls the fire -- from and then now we would at least on the campfire return are tensions as things would start to -- I look better to their search recovery probably no other time in our history on fire Los side of the house Los started out with working on the missing personnel were quickly overwhelmed by number of task and and resources that we needed system brought in a number of type three urban search and rescue teams an additional five regional urban search rescue team much like we did during the the -- but flows here in Santa Barbara in January -- at the height in old and brought in level would call HR human remains dogs little over dished all three hundred firefighters so probably to heights well over a thousand a fire law personnel working jointly together also to a point that -- stretch the limits along permits one person's capability were cal fire -- off the incident stood up and brought in additional logistical support to feed shower and take care of those personality in other site to their in Butte county again working very closely together and I would tell you that -- a lot of first you're gonna come out of this the way -- we do mapping the way we identified in search for those -- individuals at -- and in the weeks and months to come I think that -- also they should be recognize that of this is that -- station coverage specially in southern California became a significant issue Los Angeles county Los Angeles city inventor a all had stations that were uncovered vacant -- is we work with our partners on the on the fires Orange County fire authority in talking to chief Brian Fennessy was it made it was able to make additional personnel to assist and help Garbarino stations and we brought in those resources from out of state venture able release some of those resources on the incident back to cover their every day nine one one calls of those agencies were dealing with the biggest thing facing most for firefighters today in the state is a continuing on going number of incidences in protracted the long term these incidences are worrying upon their fatigue and their ability down the road -- we refer to it as a behavior health issues that we're dealing with and it is significant item -- specially -- knowing in response that -- our personal deal with but in how they -- recover and how well they do down the road aid assistance on a law enforcement standpoint in our with our partner trips H. P. if she pays over here with Jay how excellent and how well that was done we've had to bring in human remains dogs from all over the country to assist right now as well through the long pursue mutual aid side of the house and our for our side to system that particular site working alongside our online person stage piece than the will great work of Caltrans -- working on road closures -- however many women from the California National Guard in a variety of issues from firefighting operations law enforcement to assisting with shelters -- we gave a new assignment this last weekend to help with the -- feeding and caring for animals up on upon the incident on the campfire state himself stepped in health services a number of state agencies have really stepped up to work to read I think you'd go back and look probably at the height probably between north and south over three hundred thousand personnel were evacuated -- over one thousand public schools were closed it impacted more than million students being displaced from north to south and I think as you're well aware some students have no schools to go back to in that long range impact I would also add that -- comes down to some leadership and I would provide talked early on working through pre positioning of the fire service leadership why it hasn't been easy some days and I think had a couple of very strong conversations at the end the day working together getting it done and and we kind of kind of tease to one point mark and I did I said wow so once he should do we had no money because forces you to do more things together when you do have money but those things are going to make for a better California better response system that we do have today leadership is provided at the local level with our fire law -- emergency management side of the house been just just been really excellent one point two we brought in a type three a fire -- instance fourteen to -- show up -- support to paradise city town hall -- eventually managers outside of the house able to pony up enough folks to -- -- make that get them out of there and and get the right people the right place also were good we should the state level and I think most of you seen it at around the panel is that -- at callow yes cal fire CHP California National Guard leadership there they meet regularly once a month usually the fourth Thursday of the month for breakfast every morning there that they do that and -- they talk about ways we can do it better -- we talked very frankly about things that need to get done and I think that's really important in today's day and age is not about who we work for its not about a political affiliation about the citizens and visitors of this great state to make things better the real fame of this -- of of today's hearing is really about communications I'll leave you with this we've talked about it we've spoken it links after last year we need a communication system not just alert warning that is resilient in reliable for only the public but Russian public service to provide critical services whether be our land mobile whether B. R. sell your would be satellite whatever it may be we need that capability each and every day especially when we loose power or news unique situation storms firestorms whatever they may be hit us that's I would leave you with today I want to thank you and -- just before we go on to Mitchell -- I think that the and I think all of us who have experienced these fires -- who agreed that the that the mutual aid programs the coordination that the agencies have all demonstrate together's been extraordinary I I think without question we have the finest of emergency in the country -- and thank you for that and I also want to mention when you talk about pre positioning I know that for the debris flows which occurred here and which could occur sure we start getting some significant rain throughout the state where those fires have completely destroyed all vegetation and created that instability in the hillsides on the night of that debris flow people were saved because of pre positioning that you would Don in anticipation of that happening so -- the public I think should certainly feel reassured that the the best that can be done is being done in terms of these kinds of life saving efforts by our first responders and I think we all share in our appreciation for that and of course going forward there is much more than the we need to do is these events become more more dramatic -- you did mention something it's not really on the agenda for today but I think we're all concerned about is the impacts that these events are having on our first responders whether it's their mental health -- we know we're seeing a ordinary and an unusual number of -- first responders having serious mental health issues leading in some instances the suicides no recovery time or training time for this new abnormal that were having to deal with so I hope that we will take that into account but the costs just the monetary cost the cost to our children and the lack of opportunity to continue their education businesses that are losing their businesses homes people losing their homes their valuables their sense of hope all things that is who we are going for we're going to have to recognize and try to address that certainly the work that's been done -- and I'm sure with all these fires the fact that the will see fire we did have three fatalities but when you look at the extent of the damages many of us have -- I just driving up to one a one yesterday sing in Calabasas and gore and a jump eight lanes of freeway and just I know in Malibu similar things the fact that there were three dances is tragic there could have been so many more -- and one of those people we have to recognize that -- the work that's being done has been -- extraordinary so I wanted to and thank you all for the next where we are now going to focus in on the emergency notification issuing thank you gentlemen for your reports and your great work of Mitch it yet match -- who is the deputy director of logistics management with the governor's office of emergency services will give us an overview of the recent changes to state law governing emergency notification thank image thank you and good morning it's -- -- so honored to be here at -- destroying hearing information hearing and I want to thank you center Jackson and -- and your leadership I mean you're you're taking this extremely seriously and we appreciate all of your efforts and your leadership in this endeavor largest wildfires in California's history happen in less than a year and as you just heard from the chief Porter and she secures on the most LA as far the campfire -- into county was -- finally contain this -- this last Sunday and if you look back just in the last year in two thousand seventeen we had all fifty eight counties for included in the federal major disaster declaration you for either the winter storm or the catastrophic wild fire incidents so this is not isolated in his individual area everybody's impacted in California not as a result of those wild fire impacts many bills were introduced to the legislature -- in there are some specific bills that dealt primarily with a notification public safety communications and so I want to give you a follow up on where we stay stand on those -- those bills Senate bill eight thirty three a month -- from center require -- which should required Callaway yes -- before this coming July first in two thousand nineteen and warning god lot guidelines and best practices -- those that we've been working on that extensively at this time there's been a series of of meetings -- at the local level with all of our local partners group -- that we as part of the -- state emerge management system that has been addressing this and they're gonna be presenting that information to the advisory board its next upcoming meeting assembly twenty one -- for -- center Jackson really was going to is going to change the the made the nature how we doing business it's taking us from an opt out in requirement by using the utility information that's out there -- I've seen that -- we have our colleague -- -- Jeff Norris from San Matteo on the agenda today which is great because a San Matteo is our is our first adopter -- of that system and and taking advantage of that and the lessons learned our at the county partners seventy seven -- from said in as is focused primarily on translation of services in transition styles and guides and we're working on that as well and that is continue to move forward and then the assembly bill eighteen thirty six Senate bill eight seventy last year was on the docket which was going to restructure funding for the nine one one system -- to push us into the governor signed eight thirty three a twenty one in eighteen seventy seven and however was unfortunate that -- eight seventy was refuse passage about the legislature did a person politics during election year and it's important because as Kim said Rick resiliency redundancy of our communication systems it all ties together through alert and warning through nine one one and -- obviously through the -- public radio side of the house that we work on so this this it's a holistic nexus of inclusion with an entire -- network of of that communications for us so one of things I wanted to highlight the today is that recovery -- ensuring that local government government maintains their responsibility for merging notification and communication incident management is critical in key to this and which is why we work so closely with our partners at the local level -- they generally have the most accurate information -- they understand the immediate situation they have knowledge of both the potential impacts and wear protective measures are going to work or not work so that role -- their role in their maintaining their leadership out at the local level is the basis of our standardized emergency management system you'll hear their term Sims use regularly and -- it's critical for the for them -- to be in that lead and the state and the federal government come in support them in those efforts as a previous stated on -- Senate bill eight thirty three on a late morning guidelines those guidelines have been drafted they're gonna cover the timeline for sending alerts we're gonna cover -- best practices for sending advance warning impending threats a best practices for testing and training and exercising at the at the city and county level of their warning systems -- protocols for redundancy -- how to do staffing patterns trained operators to to provide those alerts at all times for affected notifications for the axis and functional needs community and really developing the message templates that we need to have in place for common terminology roles responsibilities for alerting authorities -- has to be completely vetted and and well developed and then the course the technologies available to send those alerts -- for us so -- we anticipate that guideline going for the what we taking from the technical subgroup to the advisory board which is that thirty member of state accounting and and and local membership and then if they get full adoption and will be able to publish those guidelines here are in relatively soon jurisdictions -- -- we're we're anxious to see that I get a greater put greater -- use and and really -- the counties of feeling more comfortable for the implementation and that's why I think assembly tales -- comments here today we're gonna be so good and then for the translation -- set household member them on that is working right now -- we expect that to be completed in have that in place by the summer of nineteen so three great bills that were looking forward to seeing -- moving forward and really getting good implementation -- through all of our our local and -- partners -- this is the year of implementation for those and we look forward to working together with the -- you on any future and needs that we may have thank you thank you -- I have couple questions and then I'll put it up for other questions local jurisdictions implement these bills and -- are you considering -- crafting an implementation plan with things like a model memoranda of understandings among public and private sector stakeholders yeah are a local partners are obviously the critical component to this and that's why it's -- it's great to see the -- the members that are on your next steps and then future panel we have here and they have to have that by in a for anything that we're going to push and and develop together so we've been jointly meeting with them at this time we continue to meet with them we draft up them to come back and ask them to tell us where we're offer we're wrong where we we think and so we continue to meet on a regular basis with that with those members -- to try to crafting develop the best gonna have Ford and continue prudent in is your timeline for -- -- pushing this to local emergency -- managers prior to this -- unfortunately Ted the so recent events that our time -- between the of the hill will see and and campfires December we were intending to have this -- pushed out at the next assumes advisory group on that may shift a little bit force based on time lines and then finally hopefully getting into the holidays and giving some folks a little bit time off but -- we're very close to being able to push a definitive guidelines now I've seen the draft -- and we just need to make sure that we have complete by and from all the stakeholders and weeks we can push that out services -- our target is the summer of nineteen -- to have that in place one of the things you mentioned I think we all agree is that there has to be from each of the fifty eight counties but that they have to take leadership in this -- are you -- seeing that happening are weak it has there been -- full cooperation and enthusiasm my guess is a good word from from all of our counties so I would say that -- were fortunate that we have are now at the state -- forty five that I'm tracking forty five counties -- and their representation of fifty eight that are actually signed up within the op I pause a community that gives them the ability to access emergency alert systems and send -- wireless emergency alerts -- for example nay may also have local offices so there's still some room to to do better -- to grow have a better job Xin I use I would say that Lake County is probably our best example we saw them in two thousand and and fifteen -- struggle with alert warning -- when their face the vents and by two thousand seventeen -- they were -- the the absolute example of success of alert warning on the two thousand seventeen fire that -- that struck in in neighboring to them they use their their men she alert system for the broadcast side they used it for wireless emergency alerts to use their own social media and their own local platform so -- we know that through practice and through good development -- you can have a good program in place and and I think they're a good example of of what you can see I would add that -- sure Martin's not a larger operation he's at the smaller county and -- he fights to staff in his own operation everyday but they are really good example of what can be done and how it can be done the other day it's gonna come down the locals doing it emerges camp to continue to work together at the state and local level to make it come together is there a you know we do I think all agree that the counties need to take the lead but if you only a forty five and fifty eight that still thirteen counties that are not participating be pretty upset if they don't get the kinds of warnings that might otherwise be available so perhaps offline or at some point we can have that conversation because we really do want to counties to take ownership but if they're not willing to do that that that presents a challenge and -- if you have a thought on that mental opening up to the questions yes and and we agree -- and we're also getting more and greater fidelity every day on are some cities within those counties that have adopted so you see -- they have certain and programs in place but I want to give you a county wide kind of implementation level so you can see for that's a thinking questions thank you at there were a few elements that were mentioned in this particular discussion that probably could have their own -- hearing touch on a couple of them particularly because that we have you here as panelists now and to give us feedback on -- perhaps direction the legislature should be thinking about the elements that to a a wanted to touch on it were related to mapping and search of the missing -- the other one you mentioned station coverage I and how we we think about that conversation that I know has been happening and assembly member Jim wood around a bill this year related to schools students in the state of California missing schools and several who are who no longer have a school to go back to conversation to have I know that California's it new superintendent of public instruction the lacked -- has had conversations -- at least with us a few of us at here about what needs to happen but if there are any thoughts or direction that you can provide on those three elements -- certainly they require their own hearing but it would be helpful to hear the sun mapping for them such a further search recovery standpoint again I think that in areas largest paradise and con cal and even parts Miguel you that had to be covered I think that -- it's it's a pretty daunting task so together the world in search and rescue site from law enforcement and then the urban search rescue side I think up different ways to approach how to do things but in the end the day we did it did come together mapping was brought in because of the the the share responsibility I think what you're gonna see firewall will sit down after this talk about best practices income together you know we we've got great technology and I mean that whole heartedly with with some of the mapping it's done on a day to day basis so I I think it's again just working together to to look at the lessons learned a because the next go around -- whatever the next event will be the fifth larger -- maybe it's the major earthquake we're still gonna have to work through some of this down the road so I I feel pretty confident from that side of it -- Leeson mapping side of where we're going and I think that -- CalPERS incident management team working with the urban search and rescue long person was able to that what we really need to do like to about everything we do in today's day and age it's about having programs that are not proprietary but were how we can actually interchange information no matter what we're doing -- to make it easier to bring it together and some a technology some interest sophistication of it but I think if you were at the infinite base you would see -- just some of the great work that was done by firing a lot to get to this point where we're at today Blair said going back in searching of structures over and over wasn't going to be the way to go -- but a lot of good lessons learned from last year we've made it this year and still more to do station yeah and I'll cover which is kind of -- it's a bigger issue than cal fire -- so I'll cover it in a bigger issue that will include the mutual aid fire local government and other we're recovering still from from the loss of jobs that occurred during the recession and so fire departments across California across the nation are still rebuilding -- staff that that the Los during that period of time and it's happening -- but we need to -- look at what the staffing model is that we need for this this new situation where in where -- wildfire season is year round -- and so we do have a year round need coming back to cal fire for more of that year round type of staffing that will help with station coverage because will have additional staff in the in the summer months to be able to back fill fire stations -- as we are sending engines out to going fires issue as I mentioned across the state there is there is a need for -- more equipment and more personnel that are trained in order to provide that back filling keep the the nine one one regular emergency service needs -- covered behind these mega events that were sending people across the state I'll just close out said I I we we welcome the opportunity to have further discussions with you -- I can tell you that from emerging management standpoint we have multiple task forces that are stood up simultaneously that we're trying to address issues that are ongoing from the event that is taking place -- the schools issue -- that you mentioned is is absolute critical to us simultaneously were working a debris removal -- and how to get all those cell that has the watershed -- is another key functional area that were actively engaged in a both for protection and for follow on -- and then and then right now equally with the that we would say within that same group is and we're dealing with a fairly large -- shelter population still it's going to transition into a housing -- issue that we have to resolve -- for finding a way for temporary housing -- for the survivors that area so those task forces are all on going right now -- and we welcome the opportunity to to kind of lay that out for you at a future date the earlier this year we had the -- the presidential alert devices all mobile devices are required to be sold by their manufacturers to -- Kerry those types of alerts so all devices are required to receive a presidential or -- so would you would you by the way explained with that presidential learned is so weak when you do that there are the most common type that everybody's familiar with is an amber alert -- which we see administered by the California patrol as part of that -- alerting process come from the National Weather Service where you can see when that comes from presidential time have been tested and -- have all the exact out in front of me here but they were so mixed results depending on where you're at that the some latency -- of that alert discussed a practice and understanding how to to the minister that program obviously makes it more successful so that was what I and I don't want to get in to talk about the value of that alert so that that was essentially a test of an alert that can be used by state and local agencies and has been used by state and local agencies for many times before that national test was was conducted in so that equipments the coming that all of us have it is equipped us can get those alerts in state and local agencies can avail themselves of it that is correct in and when we talk about alert warning -- obviously there's multiple levels for the wireless modular to make it from broadcasting stations might have sirens yep local a prescriptions at a many different types will be used as a down to the last piece which is door to door -- working on it but you're you're actually correct it's -- that one and then of course the one that you saw them straight away of where they were doing it to falsely state that that that was in a test that was an error was an error in a practiced a scenario yeah -- the environments you'll back us especially during the North Bay fires tubs and nuns and and others we -- up for the next sole for those local opt ins and dive in so of course a lot of people were not signed up for those they didn't go out to take that step to to do it I'd subscription of course took off -- afterward what can you tell me the that is the benefit for that because when we do sign up for an excellence by zip code to to get that more localized -- targeted alert and warning then -- people who use the wireless emergency alerts are able to give there are some limitations with current W. system the number of characters -- is probably a good example -- and then also the comfort level at the local level so that's really -- where you you like to see our our local partners a deciding what they when he is with its code red with its ever bridge whether it's an excel whatever they're using -- to push and regular basis -- I pas gives them another tool the tool kit them it's free and and so that's where we like to see if they have nothing else please sign up at the local level to have as many tools which will gets in the ability to feel comfortable a crafting a message in giving you on that alert that there's something that might you need to be aware of or the warning which and you take action -- afterwards there was a and and I'm not going to engage in critique but there is criticism about the lack of use or use of we -- -- in cinema and I have had so many conflicting conversations from people about how targeted it can actually be implemented it of course it we've talked about the lack of training -- but a about how how much for the scalpel they can really approach a community with those tools I can say that the obvious technology continues to improve from that report there was information they weren't aware that the technology an improvement on the ability to do some better shape files for your alerts -- was there that being said when you're when you're broadcasting alert over sell either platform it's going to bleed over there's always a of the over point in between areas -- but what we have found is that -- that there's kind of a myth that that -- -- sending these out will somehow be -- create other problems for her panic and and that's just not of -- been the case it's very very -- so we find that people want to know when there's a problem and they want you to send them that information or something they need to be aware of we had a -- there is the great case study of of lake and how they learned from how they use these tools and then use them very effectively and and lake has so many challenges which the chief had mentioned but geographically challenged but also -- of very low density but but very few paths of egress from the community which is extraordinarily challenging we also saw this with the Oroville dam evacuation -- in a in a similar community in the same region as the campfire where you know a hundred and eighty thousand people were told to evacuate we saw with the impacts were like -- on -- the the the few arteries out of that community and south and that that was a demonstration of the fear the concern the people had about doing too broad of an evacuation we saw -- this complicated with the campfire where they had a plan of phased evacuations that -- the speed of which the fire just overtook what that plan could ever could ever deal with that plan would have dealt with the -- B. E. impacted of of traffic on the few pass outside of paradise this this is a really challenging complication of we have it were very close to what while in urban interface for in it we have a very fast fire but we never developed the community to have -- egress that would allow for evacuation in these type of in in these types of events and that's when we're talking about alerting communities and we're just throwing them at you know these clocked pass out of town and we we heard about people had to flee their cars for died in their cars I remember -- listening to NPR one morning and and they had someone from cal fire try to give advice on how to hide in the car in a fire which was just heroin to listen to -- how to even get to that point legislate our way out of that unless you're legislate that we need to have more ways out of communities here are related to that that's really a land use planning issue on that piece that we're talking about nay primarily here is is important and and more surgically -- implementing that and then also early whatever early means and we talked about that previously a time line on that but land use planning is a big piece of this is well we need to look at communities as -- ways of mom at the the community arteries as ways of moving people out of the way as well and then -- where there are challenges we need to we need to look at what shelter in place zones look like and what they need to look like in order to get people to those spots that are closer to their homes allow for the fire to go through which is how a lot of the people ended up writing out -- the campfire they they only made it to a point in the community where some resources were there to be able to help keep them safe while the fire went past and we need to do that but if we're going to do that we need to do that in a planned and orderly way that we that we developed and we understand the resources that are at those sheltering in place points -- we can't just -- haphazardly do this has had to happen in that community me they they knew where those their those points were -- but we need to have a whole system of getting people out first and then sheltering where we have to for a short period of time until it's safe to get people I know we need to move on our next panel of we have voluntary guidelines that are coming up out of legislation that we passed this past year do you envision that these will become de facto standards or are they voluntary because we've got fifty eight counties with very different communities and and there needs to be more flexibility thank you re talking about the -- on yeah I I think -- what's happened here is going to really put an emphasis on on what voluntary means voluntary Terry is going to be a need to be before we do go on I had one other question with that and then perhaps before the next panel center stern is joined us and I'd like to give them an opportunity to share with us briefly -- his thoughts on the emergency the warning system there are so many parts to this land uses one -- and access is another hardening our infrastructure there in many different we're gonna try if we can stay focused on this alert system issue and so my question a deals with them you know we rely heavily on wireless telephone companies a two day as we look at how are we going to notify people fewer and fewer people have landline so reversed nine one one isn't as effective I know in one of the fires we had -- we ended up being alerted when a police officer came to our bedroom window -- and knocked on the door and said it's time to leave not exactly a high tech approach now on wireless telephone -- I'd like I'd like to ask you how -- -- involved are our wireless telephone companies -- at this point telephone alerts cellphone alerts to the public could you tell us -- whether they are working with you to harden that infrastructure -- what we can and should be doing to get their engagement in this -- because they they are going to become when they are one of the critical notification -- avenues and if they're not participating if they're not cooperating if they're not focusing at all on this issue that is probably something we should take a look at could you respond to that so our our cellular partners said as you pointed out our art it is actually critical -- that that they're part of this equation -- fort because that's the backbone of which we -- push all of this information -- out so -- I'll say that they're they're actively involved this particular the recoveries are stages that were in response for ages that we're in right now of the fight -- as far as the overall hardening of their infrastructure I don't have that information is not shared that with this at this time I do know that -- it is a weak point it's not public safety great I can I can say that -- that it's that is a true statement -- fort other model isn't necessarily built on that when they when they designed it but obviously the criticality of what -- we rely on -- has change so -- they are partners and they they obviously want third their networks -- to be functioning it's what they do for their business model because fiber -- either gets burned over or towers and that backbone goes down on when it's when it's impacting its down for weeks not days you know it's it it takes some time to recover restore that and we see that in the hurricanes were in fire said that we're dealing with -- but they do everything in our power afterwards to try to find ways to bring coverage back as quickly as possible except that doesn't help us when we're trying to use those wireless systems to notify people of the need to get out it is critical those as our salary is so the power in in in in the whole system without power they don't run forever the don't let the bed have something back mark again you go back to your comment about role infrastructure needs to be protected all the way around in and I'd be remiss to not say that to going back to our nine one one funding side of the house Callaway S. looks forward to working with the incoming legislature in the new governor to try to resolve the ongoing funding that we need for local government in for the state's system for the future thank you thank you -- did you want to add something that you know I just I was gonna say that yes please that that that as Kim said to secure said next Gen nine one one is going to bring other opportunities other technologies their other states that are doing things with those systems that are going to allow us to -- change how we do a late morning and and those other is -- comes on the seller's side -- actually correct also applies to the to the cable community -- that's out there if you use -- of wait for all of your communications now -- so there's you know we have to have that infrastructure -- that's resilient redundant and we can get the information out thank you center stern would you like to make an opening comment thank you madam chair and -- the other members for let me jump in on the hearing today appreciated all thank you for joining the it's been a tough couple weeks here -- I don't wanna I wanna stay refined within the scope there's a lot to say about everything that's happened and is happening in will be working with you all intensively over the next weeks months mean even days ray doing god rains coming this is all real time -- you know we don't know what Wednesday and Thursday are going to look like that's the mode everyone's in here -- so very timely hearing today -- I mean I have I have even going into this next potential series of small crises we hope they are small through the winter rain season -- question just about in the in this sort of slide vulnerable regions I do we not repeat Monna CDO that sort of middle of the night scenario power vent preceding it maybe you don't lot of folks is sleep county stood still having all opted into these frameworks that we know the members put a lot of work into so not everyone's up to speed on the alert system like very much right now what what's how's it going to look for I guess homeowners or or or residents in this region who are re populating so that's my first question just playing out and and what we hear is really that county's leading now in the response on on Wolsey -- on both sides we have to counties engaged to just maybe yeah with that sort of overlay not realizing that maybe you're not in the lead on this how how will that communication system look as we just try to get through the winter I I know there's big long term -- reforms in other topics but I can tell you that I know that we work very closely with the the county -- -- counties and and as part of their overall restoration plans to help prioritize and work together and bring all of the necessary resources and our other partners a whether it's in the utility said household as you mentioned -- senator or so we're we're constantly trying to bring resource together to help the system in that in that -- but for the for the communication sides upcoming counties are in the lead on that like it's it's really they're the main point of entry for the average resident not from state so in the weeks ahead that's that's what we're gonna see right with in terms of who people will be communicating with them in the public at large like they'll need to tap into VC alerts or log on the LA county and sort of pursue those pathways correct and what we're gonna support whatever out reach method that the that particular county has in place in addition to a town halls that were working with them on a on a regular basis to get information out Ross obviously going to post and work with them for whatever method that they have established for this whether it's on the web sites whether it's -- Britney cation through one of those alert morning -- platforms three using understood I yeah I it's something of food for thought for you all to consider I'm I'm wrestling with those moments where we just need just like you have unified command what unified communication actually looks like we had twelve competing Twitter accounts maybe not all competing maybe competing their people on scanners there's homemade Google maps going up there's officially released cal fire maps people are hunting and frenzied for information and he's crises and so I know it's hard jurisdiction only in from a coordinating function to to get these sort of multi jurisdictional events together but I I just wanted to tee it up for this committee to think on and and for you all to think on is yeah how do we just make it one stop like they're really they're really ought to be you want it you might not even you maybe shouldn't even have to know what county you're in I mean they're people live in bill canyon who who are Ventura county but there LA city fire and they think of themselves as some of them think I'm cells Angelenos some like what what system ready even on so happy I guess maybe you can answer today but how does that would unified communication là believe it or not -- after fires which UC's you do see fire law emergency management your emergency management folks the county level and ultimately the city's really are the ones that you know have a strong coordinating piece to bring people together much like we have unified command that would joint information center that comes together to share information and again if you've already stipulated that the the emergency knows no boundaries knows no jurisdictions and so they actually start talking very really honest pressures weather starts coming a lot of coordination is taking place and I think is the next panel comes up you like to be able to communicate that were some of them you know and examples from the folk should appear actually had experience of last year here in Santa Barbara we get ready for it again requires us all come together much like unified command the early planning stages -- at all levels of government inspection response side of the house to get the notification out to stay in the same page this critical and the only thing I would add for a that is that -- when at the average the average person public actually wants to look for a different piece of information they they actually want confirming information from you so you don't you to say that you think you're gonna have a single one stop shopping is really not going to be a it because people will receive -- double check you a one of allocate that and get confirming data that is out there and from a source temas we so appreciate that point because I mean you said TV news coverage actually play an incredibly important and in some cases actually a critical public safety role between the AM radio stations and TV news which you're not gonna tell channel seven what to say right they're gonna say what they want to say but in fact they played a really helpful role in both you know post disaster and even during getting information out I mean that's that's not cellular but depend so people literally mean KNX was a lifeline for certain them so I appreciate that and yet maybe that's not the right question then maybe it's not you know one stop shop but it's how to get the most accurate real time data out there maximizing that transparency during an emergency event without undercutting your fire fighting strategy but really empowering all those resources we have with maximum data about fire movement you know sort of looking just aye aye I swear there's got to be a better way to engaging with the tech community here -- that we have at our disposal like how how does that real time fire mapping start interact with the public and what what can be done to empower the all these nontraditional outlets to and I'll leave it at that thank each minute match I think just a comment we were during the Thomas fire I think we were all wherever we were relocated to watching our local news which was on twenty four seven which provided us with the best real time information as to where the fire was going who needed to be on the alert -- and again as we've been discussing center there it's a multi faceted approach whether it's radio TV cellular internet all the options -- have to be on the table that's why I think we're all looking forward to hearing what some of those best practices are thank you and I want to thank the three of you for providing to U. S. particularly as we get ready to start the legislative year -- and and think about what what needs to be done -- and how we can continue to work together so think you and for your testimony I am going to ask the following -- the next panels it to please join us now and the next panel is going to focus on implementing change on the ground -- so so we're gonna really look at what's happening we are going to start off with Holly Crawford director of that for the county of San Diego office of emergency services at Jason Terry Husing administrative analyst for to loom county office of emergency services Jeff Norris -- emergency services coordinator San Mateo county sheriff's office as well as -- Bryant will emergency managers Santa Barbara county office of emergency management just good morning senators and assembly members are going to get started my name is Holly Crawford and director of the county of San Diego's office of emergency services I've served as director for about seven years now and I look forward today to telling you about the alert and warning system that we have established in San Diego county and I think you'll find exactly what you senator stern we're talking about one unified coordinated a one stop shop for not only public alert and warning but also public communication in two thousand six the county San Diego purchased what's commonly referred to as a reverse nine one one system we now brand that system alerts San Diego that includes both listed and unlisted land line telephone numbers as well as opt in the mobile phone numbers it's a regional tool that means that all eighteen cities in the county of San Diego plus the county itself uses that same mass notification system why is that important well in the two thousand and fourteen fires which was a state -- governor declared a emergency we had one of our cities call us and say were overwhelmed can you evacuate a certain part of our city we said certainly and my staff duty officer did so registrations and are publicly written warning system called alert San Diego total five hundred and fifty thousand mobile phones where a population of three point three million that's a very high number comparatively speaking how we've done that we've offered free tacos we've offered free lift rides we've offered sandwiches we've done all sorts of promotions in order to convince the members of our community that it's important for them to register their mobile phones through our system but well we realized years ago is that people are shedding their land line phone phones more and more they're going strictly to mobile in fact in that you nine one one system which includes listed and unlisted a land line phones there are only one point three million phone numbers left so we have three point three million in our population we have five hundred fifty thousand numbers proactive mobile phone registrations and we have one point three million land line phone numbers we also recognized that as people shed their land line phones that these types of predominately often systems would not be adequate in the years to come and that's why in two thousand and nine the county of San Diego partnered with the Federal Communications Commission along with FEMA in New York City to pilot what is now known as I pause and specifically the wires wireless emergency alert system we've been strong advocates for changes to the wireless emergency alert system and we've advocated for an expanded number of characters the inclusion of weblinks and refined geo targeting some of which are up and coming in will be implemented in the year years to come recognizing that we also needed to find a way to reach our most vulnerable residents -- in two thousand eleven we launch what's called assessable alert San Diego so when a member of our community goes on to our website which by the way is a one stop shop for residents anywhere in San Diego county no matter what city they live in to find the definitive map of whatever the disaster is where the shelters are located what the evacuation areas are it's located on one website eighteen cities in the county partner to find that website and support that we lunch what's called accessible alert San Diego so when a member of our community goes to that website to register for alert San Diego you can check a box to receive the public alert and warning message whatever the protective action recommendation is an American Sign Language we have a contract twenty four hours a day seven days a week three and sixty five days a year with an organization called definitely out of Texas we pay them when we send out a public alert and warning within fifteen minutes they turn around a short video clip of someone communicating that message in American Sign Language that end user then gets a link to that video and is able to view that message it also includes text and audio along with a message now we've used the wireless emergency alert system a year ago and the lilac fire and because we are results in mass over notification we've elected to do business with we a and the way we do pretty much everything else as it relates to emergency management San Diego county which we do it as a region so the eighteen cities have signed a memorandum of understanding such that the sheriff's department and my office my staff at the office of emergency services are the only entities that initiate a wireless emergency alert what does this do well it prevents one city from sending out one message in another city from sending out a conflicting message so it's all coordinated on the issue of language AB eighteen seventy seven a dress addresses this aye we don't currently make outbound calls Cullerton warning calls in Spanish however within fifteen minutes sometimes sooner of sending out a public alert and warning a translation of that message in Spanish is posted to both the Spanish version of our emergency website it's posted to our es de emergency mobile application and it's included on our Spanish Twitter account my office is long recognized the need to reach communities isolated because of language work we have a community of four hundred thousand people who speak languages other than English at home and report speaking English less than very well and two thousand and twelve my office in partnership with our public health services watched what we call the partner really system we hold focus groups to understand the cultural considerations and communication preferences of eight eight different language communities those who speak Arabic Chinese Karan Korean Somali Spanish Tagalog and Vietnamese we recruited within our community what we call language champions within each of these language groups their faith based leaders refugee resettlement agency leaders nonprofit service organization managers all committed to receiving information during times of disasters translating the information and then distributing it back out on their networks such as their social media accounts their websites and posting it in their actual facilities the group representing the most commonly spoken language other than English and argues that would be Spanish is not necessarily the most vulnerable population for example thousands of newly arrived immigrants from Burma who speak Karan have no news channels TV stations are publications which regularly disseminate information in their native language whereas Spanish media abounds in San Diego county so it's clear that one size does not fit all when it comes to public alert and warning I would caution against over regulating or mandating requirements that may be different and rural versus urban settings and with varying demographics and local communities it's clear to me that future the future of mass notification is we have the we a system as of next year when the geo targeting is refined to a tenth of a mile our alert San Diego system which is the traditional system of both listed and unlisted landline telephone numbers and proactively registered mobile numbers will become secondary to the we a system but I want to end with the fact that we can't put all of our emphasis on tools the very definition of the disasters that systems will be overwhelmed and technology will fail that is certain where do I think the gap exists I think it exists in personnel emergency managers my staff for the ones who identified that there was no -- single grade system it was used among fire law enforcement to communicate the boundaries of an area that needed to be evacuated we solve that problem by working with fire and law enforcement to adopt a single public safety grid system so that communication from the field to dispatchers is streamlined and quicker my staff margins the managers at the county level are working to train fire and law enforcement dispatchers on the wireless emergency alert system we've emergency managers are promoting our alert warning systems and disaster preparedness in general fire service is there to fight fire law enforcement is there to stop crying and and maintain public safety but into other significant investment at the local level in people who think about these large scale catastrophic disasters on a daily basis and work to improve our resilience to them I believe these stories will sadly repeat that concludes my testimony subject to your questions thank you and the next we have Jason Terry morning senators assembly members my name is Jason Terry I have -- a little bit and a lot of the same perspective in a very different scenario I it a in part of this woman county office of emergency services are county has just north of fifty thousand people and one incorporated cities so we have where we're from but -- a lot of the same challenges in twenty thirteen atomic county was devastated by the rent fire which at the time was the third largest wildfire in California obviously with recent events unfortunately that that is dropped a little bit lower -- it was during this time that practices some of our emergency alerts and tried to find additional ways in which we could reach out to our community were -- actually drastically increased our membership in ever bridge -- was a contract with Comcast in eighteen T. and looking at the numbers today ninety five percent of the people that we have signed up through ever bridge in our county is by those contracts have opted in on their own at this point in time of course we continue to try and work with AB public education -- and a lot of our different response activities as mentioned earlier we've had storm events last couple years we have archery mortality epidemic -- we we incorporate all the public information together and just trying reaches many citizens as possible when those events beneficial -- -- tool for us to use but at the same time what I like was previously mentioned and we see -- some of those dropping off and and that leads us to one of the issues that we have using are ever bridge alert system or even aye plus system is -- seventy percent or more of our county is and Stanislaus National Forest and I heard it earlier infrastructure eyes you're climbing the hill up one await toward Sonora pass for people like to recreation or going out to Yosemite -- down highway one twenty and it depending on what service provider you have and where you're at you mind might not have reliable service so using the systems as a backbone to notify individuals just sometimes is insufficient -- and we've used it we we use a lot of different tools to counteract this -- we had the Donald fired this summer it was approximately thirty six thousand acres and was up by lake Don L. and we were able to evacuate a large number of people -- style a few dozen structures were destroyed permitted the struck structures in forest land but no lives were lost send out the emergency alerts we pair that with that -- physical contact whenever possible and then of course working with our local media partners working with the the social media sites -- through our sheriff's office and our fire offices -- we are able to fill some of those gaps but -- we still definitely have that that gap of you just reliable infrastructure up the hill at that's all I have I'll take any questions if if there are any thank you and they think will will reserve our questions so we hear from all four of you I next we have brand you'll from Santa Barbara county the morning thank you for allowing me to speak here today and for taking on this important issue -- my name is Brian you'll members who manager with the Santa Barbara county office of emergency management and one of the -- officials in our office that are tasked with public learned warning as the previous speakers pointed out and as we seen in the course of several recent disasters in our state being able to deliver coordinated prompt reliable actionable mercy information -- to the community is critically important keeping them safe in the last two years alone Santa Barbara counties been faced with several -- disasters and my office is now hundreds of alerts and warnings as a result of that we've learned a lot now and we use that knowledge to develop -- what we feel is a very sound -- emergency alerting protocol one of the things I want to convey to you today is that while a mercy learning may seem simple it can be anything but mercy incidents can happen suddenly leaving officials without enough time to get the word out there are unavoidable delays in the field alerting officials are often operating within complete non verified information their major limitations of learning tools and infrastructure there's the ever present potential for technical failures and human error there's also legitimate concerns associated with over learning causing unnecessary panic in one of the most difficult often overlooked aspects of the learning process is associated with crafting emergency messages that can be easily understood by a diverse population and can override individuals internal decision making process and trigger them to take swift and appropriate action that'll keep them safe one with the state can assist local governments is understand these and other obstacles faced by learning officials and helping a more accurate picture of the learning process for the public we need to make clear what's possible and what's not currently the public's perception is that as soon as an incident breaks whether to fire debris flow has mess bill or other type of emergency at all emergency officials have to do is press a single button and while law and alert containing complete and accurate information is sent out instantaneously reaches its intended destination within seconds and with geographic precision and arrives in multiple languages and in multiple formats this is the perception and forcing the reality as mentioned previously can be quite different another challenge in an area where the state can help is with coordination the learning process is a chain that consists of a mix of public and private sector entities that spans multiple levels of government and includes a Thomas cellular internet radio television cable and utility providers each link in the alerting chain is dependent on its downstream partners and their infrastructure to get an alert or warning out if there's one weak link in that chain the whole system can fall apart and the alerts and warnings will fail in order to be successful all of the aforementioned groups must be fully engaged properly trained have compatible gear and a willingness and ability to work together in a coordinated manner just getting these groups stick to the table can be difficult is one of my former coworkers put it coordinating this process is like extreme cat herding only worse I'd have to agree with them but despite these challenges we can and must succeed recent Senate simply bills in the state wide alert warning guidelines currently under development or takes steps in the right direction but more needs to be done a little later today -- the panel's going to be speaking about successful learning in the future hopefully I won't sealer their thunder by giving you all the details of their presentations but what I will say is that in order to be successful at a liberty -- and implementing change on the ground now local governments need a simple procedure that provides clear guidance and takes as much of the guesswork out of the learning process as possible it should also leave enough flexibility so that each jurisdiction is able to develop specialized procedures that work for them based on their own unique operational needs demographics staffing levels and budgets any products or processes developed along these lines should bolster their efforts and operations not constrain them there also needs to be adequate support and funding to provide regular repeated training on a learning tools this is imperative because just like a firefighter paramedic trains to become proficient on a piece of life saving equipment agencies and officials tasked with alert warning you to train just as relentlessly on the use of their learning tools to be able to generate fast and effective public alerts warnings in Santa Barbara county armors sealer in protocols are based on these principles we realize an array of alert morning tools with the goal of getting messages out early and often and as many formats as possible to help guide this process we've developed at your chart that provides clear direction as to which alerting tools to use and under what circumstances the chart allows us to quickly matches severity of a hazard -- threat with a specific set of a learning tools the higher the urgency or more severe the threat the more learning tools we use to notify the public this speeds up the decision making process significantly and adds an element of consistency to an otherwise a radic process we've also developed easy to follow job Bates and fill in the blank message templates in English and Spanish that service work arounds for certain a learning tool limitations like character limits and help dispatchers get emergency information out quickly this simple model has been used during several recent real world incidents as and proven to be flexible scalable and effective in closing I just want to say that we have a unique opportunity here to get this right we have the will of our local representatives and emergency officials there stop the legislation on the books and the public is asking in no uncertain terms that we do better I believe we're up to this challenge and by continuing to work together we can get this job done thank you very much for your time and next we have Jeff Norris from San Mateo county so thank you very much for including me on this panel -- San Matteo county is a resident population of seven hundred sixty thousand people were -- located between San Francisco and Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties so we're kind of the one reliable bridge between San Francisco and the rest of the nation which puts us in a unique position in that we are the support structure to San Francisco we have twenty cities that are incorporated within San Mateo county and we have our twenty first city which is San Francisco International Airport which is entirely in San Mateo county so we have a very diverse structure we have rural territories are coastal areas are in one mountain region and then we have extremely -- high density urban areas along the bay side of we have towns that range from populations of a hundred and sixteen thousand to a population sixteen hundred so we have a great diversity a cemetery county is now on its third alert and warning system over the course of the last fifteen years we're currently an integrated -- reverse nine one one as well as an opt in system were also using it for our health alerting system for our health department to be able to notify -- clinics and service providers so it's it's a very diverse as stuff -- as such I've been tasked as the primary system administrator and consequently I'm into the hardware all the way down to the how to code a particular city or particular jurisdiction into the system -- with the support of our board of supervisors and -- champion by our supervisor David Canada -- we were able to be the first to adopt a measure to pursue the additional information can be obtained under -- Senate bill eight twenty one and we greatly appreciate that -- as such we're looking to our alternative sources we're not looking at obsolete in our opt in system because that is how we're always going to obtain individuals who otherwise aren't going to be in the system are traveling community our student population individuals who may be passing through San Francisco International Airport -- to other parts of the county visiting relatives are members who have opted into our system in other states and even other countries because they have relatives here and want to know what's happening they want to know that our community is safe to obtain other data sources and we know that the biggest lack a gap in our data sources is voice over IP telephones they have superseded in many areas land lines and because of the topography of San Mateo county even though we have a large urban population we have a significant percentage who are in canyons where there is no cellular coverage at all we know that these individuals are still using a conventional land lines if they have a phone or they are using voice over IP phones -- so we're looking forward to the opportunity to how we can obtain those informations -- we don't look at these measures as obsolete in our opt in system we look at them as complementing and filling in the holes where our system currently lacks ability to contact people but as all my colleagues of stated all of these systems rely on robust ruggedized -- technology to maintain these services and when something as simple as a single telephone pole falling over taking out a fiber optic cable can cut off and isolate an entire community -- that is really the circumstance in our county we've seen numerous landslides even a small landslides that were able to take out a single pole which in turn cut off communications for an entire community -- we continue to look forward to how are other systems are other technologies are going to work on our behalf we -- were one of the early and -- applications for and I pause integrated public alert and warning system -- agreement with -- FEMA we have had the good fortune of not needing to use it but we can't that tool available to us -- we have studied and experimented with the -- training system so we understand the limitations of ninety characters we also understand the limitations of a one and done type message when a we a messages sent right now that comes through it is gone that messages lost -- and also if you don't receive it on the first pass you will not receive it we've looked at how we have -- the inability to know where towers are two right now -- centralize our our location of are targeting and we understand how we a systems consistently will over alert or under alert because your coverage of towers varies dramatically and where they're located verses the -- emergencies -- we certainly encountered that during the Glen view fire which was the -- gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno covered most of the city of San Bruno but did not cover the affected area there was no technology left in the affected area it wasn't going to get a message anyway forward to your assistance and particularly -- how the state can provide us with assistance templates guidelines that we can adopt and fit into our system we've looked at our language issue we've identified are for most common languages but we also have twenty five other languages that are less than half a percent in our population and we we're we're working at how we can reach the four most common languages knowing full well that that still leaves part of our community uncovered -- so going forward we intend to utilize these opportunities to enhance our systems to build upon it -- rather than to obsolete any section of it we intend to keep as much of are often as we possibly can to continue encouraging it -- right now we're sitting at about seventy two thousand options of our seven hundred sixty thousand population were about nine percent we're looking to try to make that number larger because we still view opt in is our best source for it for accurate information doesn't have to be de conflicted or -- checked for accuracy or or -- remote removal of duplications at any rate if -- if you have any questions I'd be more than happy to answer them thank you and I will start off -- with it just at asking a question all of you brought up language access and you know all of us here have been authors co authors and voted in support of a number of bills -- aging including one related to language I access and we share something in common with each of you that we put forward a tool which is our legislation to try to address an issue but certainly as you've all identified that tool doesn't solve every single problem right even one piece of legislation does not cover one the changing landscape on a bit too even the landscape as we understood it -- and if you have us here we're open to unending to changing to thinking forward thinking in terms of how how we address some of this issue but I mean there's we knew from the beginning there was more than one language that was gonna be spoken right other than English we also identified that it was critical to get as many people informed because one and four percent -- could actually be not just a safety issue for him or herself but certainly for others as well so how do we think about that and and moving forward and I appreciate and the recognition that there are regional differences and there is difference in what capacity what cities and counties can or can't do you -- but how do we think about that moving forward I think it's a it's very taxing from a local government perspective to talk about mandating issuing public alert and warning messages in various languages and there should be a recognition of that -- I have one staff member and I am well resource Ste a comparatively to other local three staff and I have one staff person who speaks Spanish what we've done is we've recruited county workers who are bilingual in they volunteer their time such that when we send out a public alert and warning if it's a weekend at you know o'clock on a Saturday night -- they try men and translate for us it's completely voluntary translating messages into multiple languages and only getting it out to the people its intent that it's intended for that that system doesn't exist so as the bill is written now we would need to send out a wireless emergency alert in English and as as the system exists today if I am targeting petco park in downtown San Diego that message is going to be received in my neighboring counties that's what happened last year it was received an Orange County in riverside county who called me and said stop learning my people and I said sorry it's the system I have no control over it but I will be sending out an alert in English reaching millions of people I will then by law now follow that up with a message to all of those same people in Spanish and my fear and my concern is that people immediately go already got that I don't understand this language and they go in and they turn off the wireless emergency alerts because they're able to opt out of wireless emergency alerts and less it's and by the president they can opt out of my messaging and next time when I need to reach them I won't be able to so that's the laws it's written now is if I send out an English alert it it's not geo targeted right now so it there's another year before that goes into place -- at the end of twenty nineteen the system will be improved that will allow for a tenth of a mile geo targeting that's not the case now there's mass over -- sort of a learning in the system so that's the that's the are concerned from my standpoint so beyond that even when we do get this new advanced geo targeting to one tenth of a mile and the expansion from ninety characters to two hundred forty or three hundred sixty -- depending upon which a proposal SEC read even then much of the telephone hardware the actual handsets that individuals have are not capable of receiving them still and it's going to take a obsolete in time period while people are returning older equipment getting newer equipment that's capable of receiving these messages -- we actually encountered this problem when we were having a issue with a levy able to -- call to an adjacent agency in my -- my sheriff's office and I ask for the most fluent Spanish speaking person who works in the jail he can be over in my building in about three minutes four minutes and I use him to translate for him or her -- to translate the message for me we did this for a levy issue and we discovered our older technology did not recognize answering machines we fielded hundreds of complaint phone calls -- from individuals who say they only receive the message in Spanish because when the sense system sense that the phone had picked up its start playing the English message by the time it started recording it recorded the Spanish message there are technology to our current system detects a tone and starts the message over again -- but there are technology issues that will make a multi lingual multi language -- notification very difficult and we're attempting to overcome this past weekend in this is our often systems some of which are working now with experimental systems where users can select the language they want us to receive a language and we're actually testing some prototype software that'll do that it's not ready for general public use but it certainly has great promise thank you and I appreciate to a you know the comments and and the concern about over tax seen counties and certainly when we move forward legislation it's not with the intent to over tax counties but it's also comes from especially the language issue came from multiple counties having this issue at right having real challenges in in translation I mean the examples we were getting -- were probably not refax it did reflective of the fact that you know so much of technology started in California -- and translations that not only are wrong but are putting people in more danger that causes a concerned I'm not a one time thing but a repeated thing a for counties -- and what I am also looking for is when it when we have a state a California one more than forty four percent of California speak a language other than home than English at home -- you know how how we get there it sounds like working with our partners in tech -- I know several of us that have been working with them to try to identify how we I mean the geo targeting is very important -- certainly but also how to make some determinations to be more specific -- and more targeted in what message were trying to get out to what constituency not for people to opt out previous panel also said that you know that there's a mixed review on on whether too much information one is and what it really does -- it does it really you know concerned folks or are not concerned make it sounds like there's different schools of thought -- on what that does so and again I appreciate the comments and and I look forward to hearing what what pieces we need to change so that you can be effective -- in really doing what you're you know what you're responsible for doing what the county level but also so we can get information out to Californians because that is something we hear about on a very regular basis how many during emergencies that they want accurate information to the top so think you and assemblymember Levine -- thanks very much for your presentation default on a very good job to demystify a little bit about the work that you do and and -- deals with perceptions of the emergency alerts which I think a lot of Californians have concerns and questions about you all have different size communities and therefore different size offices to respond to disasters in your communities and let's have some practical questions about how alerts work for your offices and they're not I don't I don't mean to have any suggestions the overly prescriptive because of the differences but -- is there specialized software or hardware used to do these alerts or is this something that's a web based apps that could be used on a tablet or computer from any location I also am curious about how many staff have this training in your offices and also whether there's any requirement for the staff that is trained to be on or on call and able to do these alerts in your communities thank you in Santa Barbara county and we work in tandem with our a sheriff's dispatch center -- they have dispatchers on twenty four seven where is the office of emergency management we work beyond normal business hours and we have a duty officer coverage driving down the freeway in my vehicle and if I were to get a call to send out alert I would have to pull over turn my hot spot log in my computer log into the system craft a message sent out the alert it's far from ideal especially with rapidly developing -- emergencies like a fast moving wildfire something to that effect so in Santa Barbara county the dispatch center is is really key as a twenty four hour -- warning point for the community so were working very hard to make sure that all of those dispatchers are trained to become proficient in the system so that they can get the alerts out as quickly as possible any type of computer device or or does it have to be special dedicated hardware software so it can be done on any device including a phone -- from my personal experience I I don't recommend doing it from your phone -- there's some challenges associated with that -- but they can log in anywhere in our office -- for a period of time I did a lot of the initial learning and our our protocols of shifted to wear the dispatch center is doing the initial learning and we will follow up with that or if for some reason to dispatch centers over one which happens quite frequently when alerts go out people me more information they call my will want to get that information unfortunately -- then we we will assess and by doing that -- in those cases like I described we will pull over from our vehicles and log in and -- if we're not in the office or something like that and we are available twenty four seven to do that and we have done that numerous times in the past twenty county has a very similar scenario -- our office of emergency services has one FTA and he said right here -- so twenty four hour coverages it is difficult for that it is so our emergency alerts are done through a sheriff's dispatch I previously mentioned I can be done for many computer -- utilizing the ever raging iPod systems I would just say ditto at the same exact thing -- in the two thousand and seven fires San Diego county evacuated five hundred and fifteen thousand people as a result of those fires and our staff the office of emergency services very much back up to the sheriff's dispatch initiating a public late morning evacuation campaigns senator counties taken a slightly different approach some of our dispatch centers for our twenty incorporated cities do do the notifications for the agencies other agencies contact the office of emergency services to do our notifications on duty officer status one emergency manager and one deputy sheriff for one -- sure of sergeant so we always have to people available at any given time with sending capability but we've also extended our message origination capability out to of our agencies some of our wonderful partner agencies like the highway patrol some of their sergeants have the ability to put messages out and arm our software similarly can be a have accessed from anything including a mobile app -- but we've actually -- made it configured things so that our software can be operated from the mobile data terminals that you'll find in most police cars most of our fire engines so a fire battalion chief on scene if he decides he wants a shelter in place he can put that message out right there from the back of his -- battalion chief vehicle thank you -- you know all this testimony just confirms the fact that there is no one way to solve this problem but I'd like to focus on the of that I try to resolve in the legislation that that we've been referring to my legislation on opting requiring an opt out in requiring that people are included in the notifications unless they don't want to be there are very few people OB I don't know whether we should have voted taken the taco approach Xin often talk a list everyone but we're getting people to opt into the system has not been as successful as we would like even after the Thomas fire we discovered of very few people that we seat we did see a little spike in some of the areas that were most directly affected but not throughout the county -- counties as a whole -- and this is a first line of defense so the legislation that -- that I introduced was passed does the discretion to create an opt out program everyone by requiring that are utility companies will share their information about where people live with their phone numbers are whether it's wireless her lan line and put that into the system then giving people the right to opt out if they don't want the notifications my suspicion is a people the ark and do anything and so they'll have been opted into the program which is a plus but as you say when people voluntarily often they can tell you where they live the language that they prefer to get notifications clearly a better approach but not one that seems to have been as effective so it's a system that allows discretion within each county and I'm curious -- because I'd like to see every county do this -- I just think it will help save lives and give people notice assuming that the systems don't go down you know that we don't lose sell power will all the other options but assuming that the system is in place it will give notice to people and that's one of the things we want to do could you share with me about whether you are using that system wanna use that system -- what the impediments are because nothing's perfect and I don't think I was able to anticipate all of the concerns -- and just generally where you and your counties or cities said in terms of implementing this discretionary programs that that does have those parameters to it that so in summary county we're working with to local utilities on the south coast because that area was most impacted by the recent emergencies -- and what we're trying to do right now is we're trying to identify the type of data that they have how we can configure it to be able to upload it into our mercy notification system at some of the concerns about the data are that -- some of the data can be quite old -- when she tell the information -- it also can be incomplete ideally what we want to have is one have a person's name their current address your email address number so they can receive text alerts voice calls their lan line number -- and so on and so on and so on -- the utility company so far that we spoke with have some of that data but not all of it so being able to piece it all together in a way that that makes sense so that they can get those alerts as quickly as possible checks in the mail being the fastest route to getting information it is what we're trying to accomplish can be done easily and like a server using those two utilities on the south coast as our test cases for this and are deadline for that to kind of have in place and see how it works is gonna be January first not soon enough but you know we are -- trying to do this in a way that our local utilities -- anymore than we have to -- but we're also there's a sense of urgency right maybe storm predicted for tomorrow you know and we could be utilized in information -- but I feel very confident based on what our vendors is told us and then also about the ability to provide an easy opt out for the public thank you working with that same software platform and with one of our cities being its own cable TV and voice over IP phone provider they actually voluntarily came to us and said how do we get our data into your system so we actually have a test set of about twenty thousand customers that we're actually working with how we will manipulate the data how we will get it to fit into the template how we will de conflicted with our existing so that we don't end up having to originate -- which ties up dial tone -- which will be violations short in a large scale emergency so we're we're working with the same thing we're anticipating being able to have that cities data in our system by the end of the year and using that as our test structure for how we will then go to -- are peninsula clean energy -- S. to see what their data said looks like so that we can incorporate their information as well so we're we're we're in using the same software were working on the same project successful in at least a test in very short short term thank you the other two counties yeah twenty county is excited about being able to utilize this tool -- the specifically with our utility sanitary district to be able to reach more folks -- we do have a larger population of up retired in elderly -- individuals and -- some of the intelligence individuals that we come in contact with our little more hesitant sign up for it but if they were to opt out and there are a part of it I I feel that it will make it a much more streamlined process for them to come into it be some work on the front end duplications and and -- trying to transition it seamlessly into our current system -- but there we definitely feel that there are a large amount of benefits to this program I think my colleagues have covered it well a different software program in San Diego county but same issues with de conflicting as well as setting up a formal agreements with utilities which often take sometimes with lawyers lawyers involved -- I would just say that after -- in a year from now in twelve months when that tenth of a mile is established with wireless emergency alerts that will be our primary learning system because it does capture visitors -- and you know people who don't have a land line phones and our alert San Diego system we will still use it but it will be sort of our secondary reach more people -- through the wireless emergency alerts then then with the other system but we we are excited about the the development with having utility information so the last question with respect to that it does this this does require cooperation from the utility companies they have the information at least most of it are in your experience are they cooperating is their problem is or something that needs to be done to get greater -- participation by the companies in providing that information so far -- the utilities and I've approached have been very willing to cooperate with this urgency is a little less than mine -- but on the numbers to manager some always anxious but -- I I think we're moving in the right direction and having the legislation to back up our request for information is being critical twenty counties worked with a lot of these districts and and incorporating them into our hazard mitigation plan and and we have a lot of good relationships with these folks in a lot of the same goals envisioned so I don't foresee any issues with with any of our local agencies and partners thank you thank you senator stern thank you similar -- couple just quick factual question so how how has anyone used we a in the past year I know there is a there is a instance you mentioned Holly but just just by number of times twenty counties used at -- once for the Donald fire once for done now and then if you use your reverse nine one opt in framework how many times -- last two years say a got a dozen times about a dozen non fire exam a notification rivers come through fires this several different incidents in Santa Barbara county we pride use that a total of thirty times in the last twelve months ouija ouija okay in the last twelve months it's probably been between ten or fifteen the the majority of that was around the Thomas fire is the Thomas fire moved from Ventura county into Santa Barbara county incrementally we were sending out we alerts to alert folks about the evacuations that were Kern and we had to do that repeatedly over the course of several days and then subsequently for that the debris flows we actually also did a preemptive we -- as part of the evacuation process ahead of the January ninth the free flow I think I remember you have the alert early seeing one of them I just was going back through with my staff but fast moving brush fire was the big county wide alert that went and then it was in a refer and then went to refer to the county website it wasn't sinister there for refined said evacuation instructions it was sort of a general be ready then came more refined and and you sort of plug and play through the disaster where you're going we at first but then you're using other the other platform or or you should once you pick going that route you sort of stayed there it's it's a combination thinks of first I'm not sure if that was our alert embedded in Ventura county and either way I'm sorry but yeah it is same same idea what we try to do is we at a minimum we try to get three bits of information in there what's happening where it's happening and what people need to do to stay safe if we can will try to squeeze in some Sir link to more information right and -- that's extremely challenging with ninety characters at the start of the Thomas fire every we are that we sent out Santa Barbara county what county Y. and R. counties very diverse so we're in for having something occurring in say Santa Barbara longer south coast people in Santa Maria you know tens of miles away are getting that alerts so for not specific about the location -- then there's going to be issues people are gonna be panicked unnecessarily in an unaffected area and like I mentioned before they're going to call nine one for more information to find out what to do we've had that happen and till next year right and next year we we the the system will update the tenth of a mile that should solve that should help you know actually in in the process of the I can't remember if it was during the Thomas fire or the debris flow the process actually became a fine without our knowledge we'd became aware that because we didn't receive the we are in the EOC that we sent out and we try to figure out why so we actually did some some field testing to try to figure out what area did receive the alerts since then -- it's it's been targeted -- to a greater degree than had been in the past so -- alerts are going out count or are we alerts I should say are going out county wide anymore they're going out to a much smaller more targeted area but at like was mentioned by one of the other speakers it's those we are at -- geo fences are really dependent on the configuration location a range right of the individual cell towers and even if you have those maps those ranges are are you know very you know across the board -- so that's been extremely challenging for us because we know that anytime we send this it's not going to go out necessarily to the poly gone that I draw on a map or dispatcher draws on a map to look it's gonna bleed over and there's also equal potential a if we go to small to not reach those towers for we and nothing goes out and so so it's it in a lot of ways it's -- one of our most valuable tools may be our most valuable tool but it also has a lot of complications that you don't make it difficult for us to get these out and what we're trying to do is hopefully once -- the character limit is increase it'll allow us to be more specific in the air so that even if something does go county wide if you are an orchid aye and something's occurrence out of our and says Santa Barbara -- you know you might have gotten woken up in an all night hopefully not but you'll quickly be able look your phone say okay that's Santa Barbara on nine merry that's gonna be impacted by that what I'm hearing from you all is even if we get more refined with we you can do a big county wide steerer find you also get to tenth of a mile you do everything you can on the Oct inside tacos it cetera to try to get the public information that we haven't had the opt in rates we need I mean I don't I don't represent days I know Nielsen or Dahle your Gallagher date there's some going to be some strong opinions coming out of that incident -- and it always happens and law enforcement actually it's been a very difficult position to to make that discretionary call the state at the time work shares going to you know make the decision or on the back order like you're going to the transportation factor is it is an element here that I I want to know more about it don't know if it's appropriate for this panel but sort of understanding the staggered ifak discretionary decision tough judgment calls getting made I don't know what we can do for best practices we can talk to -- yes about that too but the last question was just even if all this gets better get more refined infrastructure goes down we're still down right cell phones are down you're still down so we even we are not fail safe because we a single point of failure in our telecommunications and our electricity system so question is how to veteran a great your voice is is emergency managers into telecommunications planning and great management because we're rebuilding our our power lines right now as we speak Edison is jumped on it added Wolsey mean things are going back up but we still have some of the same vulnerabilities some of the polls are better so they're going to be more fire resistant were still it we are greed still operates essentially the same way as it has been have you have you given thought to sort of how to participate I know you have limited capacity and maybe we can help with this but -- how to how to get our rebuild of our telecommunications and energy systems to be more resilient to ensure that you're going to have a better shot as it is that more distribute generation for instance and are there sort of our do we need smaller cellular penetration in the communities that aren't great depend -- I mean have you thought about sort of those technological improvements that you want to see and if so bring him to us I mean we're having -- a fire technology the PC just announced in March I think a fire tech symposium I think it's not just about fire fighting technology it's about resiliency technology so what what it like what's what's your best thought so for having gone through this what is the what we need in this rebuild what what should we be doing differently this time around if if you could wave a magic wand could I just suggest a brief answers because that's what the next panel was actually own clout if that's alright yeah we like unless you would have to sure unless you have some quick thoughts but that is of very good good question and the next panel is hopefully going to address thank you so much for taking the time add to it to have a conversation with us anything assembly member Levine is going to introduce the next panel thank you thanks very much for that and we're going to break the next panel out into two panels just simply because I don't think we have enough seats for -- for the seven people that we've got so let me invite up for next ups improving emergency alerting in California part one rob Lewin the director the Santa Barbara county office of emergency management Kevin a gallon the manager of the Ventura county sheriff's office of emergency services lieutenant Eric Everhart of the tawny county sheriff's office and captain Cindy Pontus the Santa Barbara area commander for the California highway patrol thank you for joining us and -- in Mister loan if you like to begin a senators and members thank you -- overall the broader issue is evacuation ultimately in times of disaster be an approaching wildfire debris flow flutter hurricane evacuating people may be the only sure way to protect them evacuating people is complicated the decision to evacuate the timing the method the messaging the manner of alerting the coordinating of the evacuation all require a great deal planning educating staffing and funding ostensibly evacuation seem simple alert those who need to leave and they'll comply of course evacuation is complex emergency responders may not fully understand the situation technology and staff training women options especially when events outpace expectations finally in the chaos of a disaster citizens ultimately make their own decisions individually on their course of action in some incidents emergency officials have enough time to do three things create a plan alert the public and execute the evacuation other emergency situations cascade rapidly without adequate time for advance preparation or warning alerting becomes a kill the feel of evacuation when it comes to late or doesn't reach enough people to Brett loss of life instead of a common approach to learning evacuation however each of California's fifty eight counties have been left to its own devices resources and safeguard lives -- during disasters then after each tragedy news articles identify perceived failures of the impacted county systems and methods blame misplaced however and appropriately in the light of hindsight and finally some corrections are made the next time disaster strikes me joining county or in a county that just does not have the resources to identify and fix a problem they do not know they even have the same systematic problem leads to greater loss of life and property the necessary following the two thousand three devastating fires in southern California that killed twenty four destroyed three thousand seven hundred ten homes outgoing governor gray Davis in incoming governor Arnold Schwarzenegger establish the governors Blue Ribbon fire commission charged with broad review of all aspects of wildland fire impacts in California the governor's Blue Ribbon fire commission a report identified many recommendations that dealt with all aspects of while and fire protection one of those clearly identified -- they need to improve systems to alert and evacuate residents a quote from the report the commission recognizes the critical role of timely emergency notification of the public of imminent threats and recommends that local governments prioritize development of appropriately early warning systems to address the needs of their communities many of the victims of the October two thousand three fire siege indicated that they had no warning of the fires approach in examining potential early warning system to address our needs of their communities local governments should consider reverse nine one one emergency evacuation siren systems and potential combination systems especially in remote areas so what do we do to improve our learning and ultimately evacuation so taking a cue from the two thousand three fire season it behooves us to once again convene a diverse group of experts to focus on evacuation alerting and provide a foundation for all the counties -- to insure each county has three tangible things for successful learning software and hardware adequate staffing and good training number three for an alert to be successful requires five three five things the field into c£m Anders of fire law need to be able to attain a situational understanding the murders he quickly lan to put together they must convey the actions of the public needs -- they must convey the action the public needs to take to -- the dispatch center a clear messaging of the public that they understand including a multiple language must be sent quickly from that dispatch center a technical system that works faster deliver the alert message every time -- we have so providers that are now as important as our public utilities they should be included in that level of regulation and finally a citizenry that is prepared and willing to take action such as to evacuate thinking thank you Mister Lewis wrote down cheers on shares honorable members of the committee my name's coming down from the Ventura county sheriff's office of emergency services thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony today regarding emergency notifications -- first I would like to just offer a heartfelt thanks on behalf Ventura county for everyone that -- supported us during our response and now are recovery from the borderline hill and we'll see incidents it's been a pretty impactful two weeks room and maybe watching where some of the first responders to mutually to help us out so thank you Ventura counties Hauser portfolio spans a pretty broad broad spectrum is many places in California we have technological failure hazards such as dams natural hazards earthquakes being one of the prominent ones and human costs threats such as terrorism unfortunately many of these hazards we face catastrophic results and come with no notice so there's a big difference between what our east coast -- public safety organizations may face with a hurricane -- than what we face here in southern California or California on the broader scale I think I'm you know alert and warning has become such a valuable tool but also is one of the most important critical responsibilities and functions we face in public safety on these large scale events and disasters on because it out inventor county we strive for perfection in alert and warning we've invested significant capital and resources over the years to ensure that we have a successful program and at the core of the it's a partnership and a lot of our colleagues today have already discussed this but -- rob rob brought it up with the mornings really just a tool it's evacuations its emergency protective measures that were trying to communicate and those are originated via software tool -- those are human decision making processes and capacities and so first and foremost I just want to acknowledge that and Ventura county -- we look at that as the primary -- the primary focus of an effective alert morning program is this human element the decision making process -- and it's an integration between what's going on in the field and what's going on out support locations whether their command post emergency operation centers -- so forth -- our approach to hold community emergency management on the grand scale is our emergency notification an alert morning program of inter county all ten cities along with the county on a formal are in mourning agreement which establishes our baseline standards and processes this also includes our emergency operations plan that includes sections -- that discuss how alert morning is going to take place in the county -- we use a multi modal system -- that system includes our emergency alert system the wireless emergency alert system VC alert which is our locally -- managed program -- siren systems for one particular hazard the dam hazard -- and then all of our other sources traditional social media -- websites and then something I can't under emphasize but it's the in person notification we spent a lot of time talking today about the technological side but when you have it a no notice event such is the hill fire that occurred have dispatchers who are twenty four seven it doesn't matter if you have someone keyed up ready to you -- type out an emergency notification initial notifications gonna happen by first responders inventor county we spent a lot of time training discussing planning for be our typical response to something so if there's a fire it's rapidly moving based off of red flag conditions we as an operational area take different actions initially them what would have been take in if it wasn't in those conditions such as fire resources and law enforcement resources might not actually put out the fire they might go down range to trying to evacuate people -- so in person notification still still is a very very important pillar within our notification process all kinds of respond or is using PA systems aviation air assets -- the whole nine yards aye during recent incidents like the Thomas fire walls the in hell fires be deployed everyone of these tools to significant levels and we've had the opportunity to see were some of the challenges exist within the deployment of these tools I also would like to mention that pose the Thomas fire all of our lives have gone out in both English and Spanish along with all of our support public information tools such as our websites and social media accounts -- it comes out Acosta aye specificity and -- -- the ability to be -- clear and timely when you're adding translation factors into it definitely has effectiveness -- however it's increase the effectiveness in communicating to you larger populations so there's a given take and we're trying to navigate through that process as we work in -- unfortunately were navigating it through during real disasters -- currently not one of these tools is perfect we for that multiple times today -- there's plenty of limitations each one use so that's why were in all in county we deploy every tool we think is appropriate given the scale or the severity of that event now we're not gonna send out a wireless emergency alert for a small -- -- incident that's in packing a very you know type population we might have better opportunities using in person notifications and our and our hosted system the sealer -- but when we rise to the scale of large fast moving brush fires or other types of events -- we had hazardous materials incidents -- a few years back in Santa Paula we use every tool on those types of events -- to mitigate these limitations enhance infected effectiveness in providing emergency notifications alerts and warnings for this panel to take kind of contemplate a few things that we think are important one obtaining better access to the best data sets available including -- cellular service providers -- continued funding for local emergency management training programs and continue funding to procure the best a learn warning systems available on the market -- even with passing the recent legislation for example that the opt out program -- with -- utilities -- it doesn't include that cell service provider group and they have a monumental amount of data that could be used by us to effectively communicate that right now we don't have access to -- additionally improvements in the wireless emergency alert system we as a local organization -- are trying constantly to communicate the importance through FEMA and the F. T. C. too quickly improve or provide these updates to the wireless emergency alert system I would just ask that you know the state also participate in that advocacy to continue to improve the wireless emergency alert system or I pause the integrated public alert and warning system as the programs called -- at the national level and when we get this new rollout next year -- with expanded characters and the possibility of embedded images we're we're a nation of images now -- we like to get evacuation orders with maps -- that's why all of us have interactive maps on our websites now I having the wireless emergency alert come across with expanded character count and then also embedded images would be an amazing -- improvement in that system but once we achieve that hurdle there's going to be the next hurdle that we need to achieve a jump over aye with wireless emergency alert and so just to continue to -- -- advocacy on all of our parts at the local and state level with the federal government to continue to improve that project in the long run I including Ventura county will continue to partners both local state and federal to ensure that we're on the cutting edge of defective bleeding edge we tend not to want to deploy tools that are vetted in don't have -- tried and true methodology a we're one of those groups that was one of the early adopters of ouija however we didn't initially deploy our our wireless emergency alerts at first -- because of the challenges and the unintended consequences that could have been a created by it so it took us some time to -- before we deployed in on the Thomas fire was the first time we deployed that I thank you very much for this opportunity to testify in and happy to answer any questions you may have your mistress from a gallon of the tenant -- heart put an error error with each woman county sheriff's office in is described earlier twelve county is a rural county were about twenty two hundred square miles with about fifty two thousand people so with the spread out quite a bit about seventy percent of that land is public land so we get a lot of outdoor recreation which was actually challenge during the Don L. fire going up those campgrounds because we don't have coverage in those areas a lot of the solutions we talk about deal with technology and we do used ever bridge we do use we -- but because of those gaps in the cell coverage in our county we still make personal contact with that said typical staffing for us for law enforcement is a sergeant three deputies for the entire county so for me that to get Debbie's out to a campground that maybe forty five minutes or an hour away to make sure it's clear -- working with local for service cal fire whoever else maybe in the area as a kid get those contacts out there when you start looking at ways to increased the resiliency or the coverage in those areas I know that first net is going to help without any with the following first not know the bill those solutions are many years out so as we go forward you I think we need to look at the so companies and see you asked the question are we doing everything we can to expedite that process second we are the so companies doing everything they can using all the technology that's available today to provide that resiliency so if that bundle of fiber is melted our cat -- that there's some type of back call whether it's be through radio or satellite to make sure that system stays up in place I we had a bundle of fiber several years ago coming into quality county that was cut and the majority county was without phone service for many hours point of failure so we need to also make sure we identify where those other single point failures are -- so that's that's a big challenge for us in our in our county is one is having the system is reliable that we know is gonna get the message out but also getting the resources on the ground how to the people that need those notifications thank you lieutenant captain Pontus place good morning I met city pints cap to the California highway patrol here in Santa Barbara I'm honored to be here on behalf of commissioner Stanley who was regrettably unable to make it today -- I'm here to provide some information regarding C. H. P.'s emergency alerting processes and capabilities this each fees emergency notification and tactical alert center serves as a resource to all law enforcement statewide into learning the public in response to adopted children assaults on law enforcement an endangered missing elderly persons through the amber blue and silver alert programs divisibility these emergency public notifications the siege be directly accesses the national emergency alert system to broadcast approved alerts across public television cable and radio broadcast networks we also utilize the wireless emergency alert system we add to you directly message cellular devices with best within specified geographic areas in addition to these alerts the C. H. P. may coordinate the activation of highway changeable message signs with Caltrans the lottery message boards with the California state lottery and we also post to social media sites which are actively monitored by law enforcement and media outlets across the state amber blue and silver lower emergency notifications to the public are typically disseminated within minutes of the initial request as a result of these capabilities proven over more than fifteen years this CHP possesses the technologies and has established the relevant communications links to support emergency notifications to the public at a note as a no cost resource to all law enforcement statewide unlike most other emergency operation centers which must be stood up over a period of time in response to an event the siege be status it's emergency notification and tactical alert center around the clock twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days a year which insures immediate access to a cadre of trained personnel only slowed in the dissemination of emergency notifications by the limitation of exist in technologies disease fees not combined or limited by jurisdiction a single county or city when disseminating emergency notifications rather as the state police the department rapidly pushes these notifications statewide or can target any combination of local jurisdiction I county or several counties several cities a suburb or specific neighborhood and that is necessary to reach the affected public based upon the specified incident that's occurring at the time the C. H. P.'s emergency notification and tactical alert center has become a known resource for all law enforcement statewide as a result of the amber blue and silver alert programs thinking thank you captain Pontes we're gonna ask for this panel to swap seats with part to the panel that to still hang out with us we may have some questions for you and you may have some more insight to add the like to welcome Dr Chad Hansen the research he colleges with the John Muir project Mitch make dig of itch the deputy director of logistics management from the governor's office of emergency services for an encore presentation and lily on and seen as the public outreach coordinator from the Santa Barbara fire department when I say thank you for all three of you for sticking it out and remain with us -- for this panel and doctor Hanson if you will thank you I want to thank the legislators said and staff first off for organizing this and and focusing on public safety -- on these issues where it needs to be -- I also want to start by emphasizing -- that you're the point obviously is to create a public warning system that is effective and meaningful in in protecting the public and done there are two things that don't really need to happen to make sure that that occurs is not just a matter of of of having a warning system because out and we talked a little bit about that -- -- cellular primary but some people don't have that access -- that the communication for structure can get taken up pretty easily so -- low tech redundancies are going to be important they're going to continue to be important -- sirens knocking on doors basic things like that especially some the more rural areas thing is that -- people you need to be able to receive the information a way that helps them to safely evacuate -- and part of that comes down to evacuation assistance -- not everyone once they receive the warning is able to evacuate on their own -- there are some of residents who are elderly and are not able to -- actually assistance -- people gonna need that help -- some people need help evacuating themselves and animals as well and we need to keep that in mind because people are staying behind in some cases because they don't want to be there forces are dogs or cats need to be mindful of that -- so I think we need a a better evacuation assistance infrastructure -- they can be mobilized -- and that maybe is dispersed in various places especially during high fire weather when we know what's coming and then the the the other key aspect of this is the timing people need the amount of time to evacuate after they receive the warning and there's certain things that can influence that so I'm a talk about one of those briefly which is -- unplanned human additions in this comes in a lot of different forms but the reason I raise this especially as a a forest and fire ecologists is that ignitions are very very different in high elevation more remote mountain areas other farther away from communities those are mostly lightning strikes and those areas those fires are a long ways away the people have a lot of notice a lot of time even if those fires do move downslope towards towns Sir to communities in lower elevation areas those -- ignitions are overwhelmingly human additions and -- they're coming from a lot of different things sometimes it's power once images have a conversation about putting a lot of that underground in some cases making sure that those power ones are shut down during extreme fire weather do that in other cases it's is just people doing -- ill advised things fireworks are illegal campfires -- lots of things that can cause ignitions -- near communities in some cases it's ours are there is an example just a few weeks ago -- in the mountains where I live in southern California -- where we had -- the person driving up and down highway thirty eight in the truck throwing flaming objects out the window -- during what was predicted to be extreme fire weather -- and -- this happened this one of ours and -- to my knowledge this individuals not was not caught but the point is is that people were you knew about this is happening this was going on for three or four hours up and down in this person was deliberately doing this to throw to try a treat fires near communities during what was predicted to be extreme fire weather now fortunately the heavy winds that were predicted didn't come on that particular day at that elevation and so -- disaster was averted but the point is is that extreme fire weather was known to be coming and this was a person who is taking advantage of that in a very -- your pathological way and -- this can be prevented if we have -- more law enforcement funding more infrastructure devoted to preventing those on plan human additions in extreme fire weather near communities so I think we need to think about that because that matters from alert and warning standpoint because if it's humid missions are occurring close to communities during extreme fire weather then people have very very little time to evacuate once those warnings come and so it's it's a factor we need to keep in mind -- the other one -- mention yes just in terms of funding allocation resources are finite and there's a lot of different funding streams out there that have been allocated for various things about these issues of the did the basic dichotomy is do we focus on -- vegetation management out and while this what we focus on communities hardening -- making your Farsi principles prevention on twenty missions things a prevent those fires close in the communities and I would submit we we need to focus on the ladder -- and I set up for a couple reasons number one it's been proven to be highly effective -- and number two a lot of the vegetation management activities that happen removing chaparral for example can replace it with very combustible invasive grasses that spread far even faster -- allowed the logging activities that occur can actually increase fire intensity and spread -- and -- you again resources are finite so -- to the extent possible where there's flexibility -- I would argue that those resources should be focused and spent on protecting homes -- prevention on planes unit ditions helping people do defensible space doing all those things that can prevent fires and help people safely evacuate during fires -- I would say also that -- -- SB nine a one funding is an example of this three broad language fire prevention I think a lot of that funding to be used in that capacity and I would suggest that you be happy to questions with thank you doctor handsome semitic that should thank you are you know there's been a lot of great information it's been shared so I just wanted to target in a couple items -- specifically for improving -- and you've heard it over and over but it's if the question when you're gonna have to issue an alert so -- exercise in practice and proficiency -- has to be maintained at anybody who's going to be issuing alert has that authority and has that responsibility on has to be ready to to show when you get that warning -- whether it's a red flag or purple or of some type you know locally have to be ready to what's what is the message you're gonna send that alert level increase participation -- and there are multiple tools and tool kits and you have to have something in your could -- ready to be used at the local level resiliency of infrastructure in you're going to hear that -- over and over again should be our standard -- that we're looking at -- and in those areas -- with our full cooperation together between local to federal -- we should be able to take take a good chance to -- to tackle this set and come back to the original method thank you thank you very much Byzantinist hello thank you for having me I'm honored to be here and make a statement on these issues -- secondary alerts for non English speakers is unacceptable just unacceptable cross cultural sensitivity successfully navigating a different culture and interacting with this culture cultural relativism is the idea that a person's beliefs values practices should be understood and based on that person's own culture it has been proven time and time again that -- in an emergency situation people will revert to their native language and I translators and interpreters build capacity and -- and they have to have deep knowledge of both languages linguistic disciplines that are rarely performed by the same people the difference is not only the medium but the difference in skills training aptitude and even knowledge that are so substantial that few people can do it successfully we should not rely solely on volunteers or persons familiar with the language but invest in our own staffing model certified and qualified multi lingual personnel that are within our emergency operations centers -- because of the ability -- so interpretation and translation are two different things and the skill of interpretation is crucial in an emergency setting because of the ability to transform idioms local colloquialisms and other cultural specific references into analogous statements the target audience will understand I'm it's just like you cannot explain of thought without understanding the thought first and so if you did not fully understand it neither can you translate or interpret that message -- without the mastery of the subject matter related and hence the importance of certified qualified interpreters and translate into translators hence the importance of cultural relevant teaching being crucial in all of our preparedness efforts such as programs that are state funded or state supported through the office of California volunteers which is the state office I like least those for example that means ready in Spanish and these are grassroots public education programs that enhance the preparedness efforts taking into consideration that cultural sensitivity there's the Spanish language cert program which stands for community emergency response teams and then there's programs like our local programs here the radio ready programs that partner with agencies that will have of you know live broadcasting or or airing and and really relay that message to these will double populations are non English speakers I'm I'm gonna leave you with the with up well lastly right no one is at lunch to seek out to your community and include them in your local preparedness efforts sometimes at an emergency of managers level or worry within our organization we forget to get the communities input and what do they want how do they want to receive this messaging to they rely on their phone what is their method of communication and sometimes it's easy if we relate relate to that to build the whole community approach when up plan for disasters nuns again leave the powerful phrase that always sticks to me by -- Nelson Mandela and it says if you speak to a man in a language they'll understand but if you speak to them in their language it will not go to their heads but to their hearts think thank your image for leaving us with that thought are there any questions for the panel yeah we could just throw down a bit with with you match on -- can just go a little further on resiliency we talked about the cell network on the edge of that last panel but help us through this bit so what thank you ideally you would like to be at the public safety grade -- for what is that what is that mean that is a standard that is established that -- allows -- its its premise for what -- the hardening in the resiliency of of the what you have there so on those platforms received back up of power sources for them you're gonna see -- gently hardened and structure of some type in a sea of maintained a for them -- so there's in a kind of a whole series of those items that are there and -- and when you have that it obviously helps protect radio infrastructure that you're using so -- that's obviously the ideal and you want to be able to you know for example callow yes we divert areas we could refill our personal network were because we support -- the first responder community cal fire CHP -- DOJ's corrections are on our on our network calluses network power for multiple days and so -- you know we have backup generators that allow them to run -- for long periods of time so that they're not going to -- go down there we didn't have to try to race in there to get to refuel them in the middle of the event -- we had that capacity and so on when you have that that back up nay capability it's certainly helpful and so the more resilient whether to hurricane or fire your you want to make sure that you're in a position where -- systems are operating in and so in the context of SB nine no one I mean I I know we sort of went through a broad directive to the public utilities commission about how to interface with both I'll use -- I have I forget the role the PO used by no the CCA's also have a role to play here I mean are they your your your protocols are pending right you're still you're going to publish the protocols sorry not under nine no one but your recommendations later this year early next year you for a eight thirty three for our guys for before that's I work we're gonna have ours we've already drafted -- and at the what I would call the technical advisory level where our locals they've already taken a good look at this in a been editing the document so we we were scheduled to have that presented at the Sims here in the middle of December I just don't know if -- the advisory board -- and not sure if that's gonna still take place based on what our current events but just to just to manage expectations for the scope of that that's a that's voluntary guidelines for public emergency alerting and warning not necessarily gonna touch on this resiliency question correct it it's it's it's more about best practice -- Acosta locals to utilize that's correct okay so really it's a Browning this conversation would got its start maybe engaging the PC or those on the on the who can actually require or -- interface with our telcos in our utilities in terms of that resiliency planning that is actually correct and we -- have met with the CPC and continue to work with them okay great thank you thank you yes I think there's a lot more in the hardening level I think of our cell phone companies I've heard I've heard that mentioned several times that they've got a step up here and help they're one of the primary sources of information I'm not sure that SB nine a one included them per se it might been the power companies but they have been -- noticeably silent in their my hope that they will step up -- before the legislature since they are clearly now part of this whole emergency notification process -- I wonder if the other people who spoke if anyone has -- any thoughts about that war I did I did have a couple of quick questions -- I know we've we're running over in our colleague to go to catch a plane -- but I think this is still very important we're not done yet we've got debris flow pot potential up and down the state very I think urgent and media is solemn for anyone on the panel -- it is anyone thinking about alert and warning systems like cell phone tax that -- cam and confirm receipt or identify -- causes why the lower alerts are not being received so that we make sure everybody gets that information Sir any anything being done to address that problem for that conserve senators and members -- -- I guess I would add to what you're suggesting that the the cell companies responsiveness in that we have vast -- questions and of the cell companies on why certain things are happening why there were certain failures and unfortunately we don't get those responses I'm not sure what the requirements of a cell company already to go and do researcher report back to who or what -- let me give a couple examples during the -- one nine debris flow the National Weather Service issued a we -- of flash flood warning but it did not seem to go out we don't know exactly to -- one of the provider companies -- so there was a big hole in the system -- that we don't know exactly why that happened and then there's -- during the presidential alert -- we experience that several phones in this big meeting we're having did not activate including one of mine -- both of my phones have the same provider but one activating the other didn't we've asked a question about why so there's I think part of it just not just hardening but also understanding and looking at the technology to try to figure out where these problems are Santa Barbara City we're all fond of a path not gray was -- asks why we can't have a read a -- system that works to the same level of uber and lift where when you need a fire engine it goes and sees where you're out in response to in the same sort of method Alaska another question why can't we have learning system instead is based on cell towers but instead is based on the GPS of your telephone that instead of sending it out all over and hitting different -- bleeding over other system why is there a technology I've no idea that could hit target people that are in those areas just in the same way that other systems that we currently have do they certainly target you to show you a pair of shoes and they also target you -- when you're in another location I was in Chicago over thanksgiving for share with my grand kids and I was getting all sorts of advertisements about all the stuff I could buy in Chicago I'd not given them permission I didn't know how they knew it but they do and I think -- I think you know obviously there's a lot of money associated with that those kinds of efforts and -- hopefully they will be a little more responsive when it comes to saving lives in the public safety of the people in the communities that they are also serving so appreciate that you are absolutely right that those kinds of things I'm sure are available they know where you are all the time chisel creepy but but they do know this and certainly there there should be upper opportunities and least some sort of incentive for them to step up on this and that and eight I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that they are very responsive during an emergency to trying to help first responders are communicate and all of that is greatly value well that's wonderful to hear and obviously once you're in the emergency getting that help is critical but also we we talk about those warnings to get people to safety -- we've got extend that debt responsibility as well would seem to me warning system that allows the public to follow up and to ask questions in a way that doesn't involve calling nine one one -- because I know during the -- -- I can't remember what part of the Thomas fire two thirty in the morning I got a we a call that there was a fire didn't say where didn't say what in my temptation was to call -- markedly duty because I am on speed dial of not a good plan at two thirty in the morning but I was awakened and I wanted to know what was happening and I suspect everybody in the community had those same -- anxieties but didn't have his phone number so I think that that's a question that would be helpful if we could get some kind of indication whether that follow up type system is being considered is available or should be part of our discussion going forward chairs that kept me going again from mentor county office of emergency services so currently I don't know about that technological capability of the notification system in that sense we do get analytics back on our on our hosted system the BC alert where we can see people had received the message when they -- select different they get the message a how we address that a very topic though is we establish a call center alleviates pressure off of our one system -- which is hugely important because people still need to call nine one one when they're having a heart attack -- while the fires occurring right so we -- establish immediately when we issue evacuation orders or shelter in place orders in Ventura county we established that -- emergency hotline and then we also have the website where people can get information and we push those emergency notification system so as they're getting those BC alerts or the wireless emergency alerts they're getting follow up information that says go to these different sources for additional information and we actually use the caller ID number for RBC alert system as the call center number so some people will just be able to hit re dial or a you know call back that caller ID number and they'll get routed directly to our -- call center all right do we have anyone else who wants to respond guess cation we asked the the residents if they have a need or systems to get out of their home to contact us and writing a refer as well because it was an issue that came up on the rim fire was how many ambulances buses or whatever also may need for people that can't walk that they were were car assistance getting out of the home -- what would be nice if there was a way to a one stop shop if you will for somebody to it whether it's physicians in hotel services to provide that information to law enforcement so that we we have that information readily available when we draw our map of the impacted area to say okay I'm gonna need six ambulances to get these people out area so that would be some we would like to see as well thank you very interesting all right -- yes Mister yeah account center check such wonder does he won party thing there there's a couple conversations on on accuracy and for that information and some of the technologies was going on there ma'am the FCC controls location accuracy and this is an area that -- your support when you're talking with our federal counterparts could be helpful to remind them to continue to improve our location accuracy whether it's calling nine one one or the ability to broadcast signal backwards on same cellular network -- for that same location accuracy Mitch cam just as commission fall here Sir in lightness in terms the we advocacy Prosser with the stage it is there are there Senate guidelines have been published that folks are commenting on now like how how does that process actually worked to hitting at twenty nineteen deadline coming up and then as well as sort of this FCC side like is this is this all locked in or is it influx could go faster potentially you know are we gonna have formal opportunities to reshape this or is it just sort of on track and going the the from from the sampling from Calloway's producing those guidelines were on track and work and that night that you -- the federal process on the federal side yes yes the the federal process for for improving -- location accuracy is is -- is has been said they're not they have not adjusted their time lines to increase that so -- we obviously would prefer them there there's currently no mandate to actually go to a hundred percent so -- they're they're they having set their target at in our level where you're going to guarantee that portion of the let alone the the more we talk about the Z. axis for vertical axis for you -- that's -- we're just one X. Y. I know where you're out on the ground and can target Chiu a properly on your call and get you complete located there so and the reason assure that is because the the you you reverse frame the question of what can I similar back out to the individual and and so because hand in hand with the same location accuracy and that's not a part of the we update process though that's a separate process within FCC that's it that's outside and who's who's overseeing the the we update is that going to DHS it is sent and we work on the aye plus our household that that whole program is working DHS silence I think that might be something we can pursue a little bit further what we can do is a state we do have some limitations -- certainly there are things that we need to do going forward if we can jurisdictional a we may not be able to but to the extent we do a jurisdiction that would be helpful so we have run a little bit late but it's time to thank you very much I I hope it's been is helpful for you is I think it's been for those of us here in the días and hopefully for people who are -- watching us online -- it we will take public comment now if there is any may I see how many people are public up we have -- at least three four will give you a two minutes each and I will I will bang down the gavel at the end of that two minutes so why don't you come on up give us your name affiliation and good afternoon I'm Richard road when I'm vice chair of the California emergency alert system state committee and is your single point of contact for broadcast radio television and cable as far as -- emergency warnings that go over the air or come through the cable half century of research that says that reinforcement is important to get -- a public at risk to act in reinforcement comes through multiple warning sources multiple messages and -- coordinated information release -- the -- this is going back to something that is kind of low tech like broadcasting is important when the infrastructure is impaired it also provides a feedback loop if you have relationships with local broadcasters so that when the time people have a way to in the broadcasters can actually if they're monitored by the emergency management community can -- get a handle on what's going on out in the field on going to say is I have a hand out I'm gonna leave with -- with you about draft best practices for local emergency public information and -- I think I'm gonna leave it there and -- anybody wants to speak to be off line I'm very much available on the contact information is on here and I think a major two minute limit thank you and thank you for your good work on this issue will look forward to the documentation next my name is Brian could on the vice president IBM which is emergency management consulting company I also previously served as the director of emergency management for the state of Florida -- for seven years until the end of last year -- Florida faced in faces many this similar challenge the California does in terms of large population rural and urban divide -- and the number of hazards as well as areas they're difficult to evacuate -- so a couple of recommendations based on my experience in Florida one is -- insured as Lilly Anna said to be citizen centric and think about all the different ways that your Californians receive information so aside from city county government state government they'll also be receiving information from schools colleges universities a utilities so you wanna make sure that you coordinate your policies and your messaging receive conflicting information because conflicting information leads to friction in their back you Asian process which can lead to death so bringing more people to the table at this stage -- will greatly enhance your effort -- the second thing is it is -- in your working on and you guys are doing terrific work in terms of policy development and legislation -- is everything you can do at the state level to help support in terms of policy development -- in terms of funding in terms of marketing outreach education to help citizens understand cannot do and what their role will be when they receive this information -- and then making sure that they'll the local governments have the operational control it it's a very important at the locals be able to push that message out for their communities that you do everything you can at the state level to empower their ability to do that we found that to be the most effective relationship -- and I think -- probably also work in the state of California as well thank you thank you very much appreciate I'm should I know you've had a few problems in Florida too so we she hears testimony anyone else step up hi my name's Frank Redondo Chumash most likely descendants native American heritage commissions list as part of that the disturbance of ancestors are buried in when we have fire occasions like this there's a potential

responses from the agencies that say that we deal with federally recognized tribes the Armenian venture abandon mission Indians are not fully recognize what they are are listed on the heritage commissions AB fifty two tribal consultation this now granted that's for development proposals but if you look at the tribal policy for -- office so yes have an option for non for the recognize strides as any in organizations to participate especially for developing best management practices as well as protocols we would like to be at the table we wish we would have been notified about this meeting we only heard it I heard about it on the radio by Mr Palminteri this morning coming in and notify the tribal chair that this meeting was taking place and she said definitely come in and say something so -- under the government's eleven its responsibility of all agencies to initiate some form of consultation with tribes because this group is on the verge to list they've done the due diligence to the paperwork to follow the laws we just want to be noticed brought to the table so Preciado thank Newman Julie noted thank you for coming any other members of the public good afternoon

thank our first responders I want to thank all of you who are working in the emergency management field and all of the public has been here and our media it's ical import the public has got to understand that there are limits to what we can do mother nature does not share play book with us mother nature is not happy with this we are seeing events occurring throughout the country in the world from Florida to Texas the California that we never anticipated -- if what we are doing our best and I think it's important that that message get out there that we are working together -- the
