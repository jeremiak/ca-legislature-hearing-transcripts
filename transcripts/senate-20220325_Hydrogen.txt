ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A ONE TRILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT INCLUDED NINE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR CLEAN HYDROGEN PROGRAMS. THE GOAL OF TODAY'S SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING IS TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR HYDROGEN STAKEHOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PRESENT THEIR WORK IN THE HYDROGEN SECTOR AND TO PRESENT THEIR PLANS FOR OUR STATE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY. RENEWABLE HYDROGEN WILL PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE TO REACH OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS THIS IS UNDENIABLE NEW HYBRID THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RIGHT WAY THIS MEANS BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS. WE NEED TO RESPECT AND HONOR THE WORKERS PAST AND PRESENT WHO HAVE HELPED MAKE CALIFORNIA A GLOBALLY ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WITH TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS NEW HYDROGEN SECTOR. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE LOW INCOME EARNERS OR PEOPLE OF COLOR WE HAVE JUST BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFERED THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE WITH US IN THIS NEW GREENER VENTURE. AND THE FUTURE OF GREENER ENERGY. THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WHO COMPEL US TO SEEK THE BEST ALTERNATIVE. FOR OUR CARBON BASED ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA IS A TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS AT ALL OPTIONS TO GET US TO ZERO CARBON. HYDROGEN WILL BE A MAJOR PART OF THIS EQUATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE TO MAKE OUR PLANE ZERO CARBON HYDROGEN FUTURE A REALITY. NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER- TYSON ACKERLEY. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MARKET DEVELOPMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. GOOD MORNING MISTRETTA LATE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE ALL THE SPEAKERS- AT ABOUT A TWELVE MINUTE INTERVAL SO- RIGHT ABOUT THEN WE'LL WE'LL GO AHEAD AND LET YOU KNOW THAT. YOU CAN- CLOSE WITH YOUR REMARKS YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO KEEP EVERYONE DOWN TWELVE ROCKNE TWELVE MINUTES CHAU WELL WELCOME ONCE AGAIN AND PLEASE AGAIN. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER AFTER A LOT OF THINGS FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. IT'S OUR YOU KNOW REALLY SAID I WANT TO ACTUALLY START WITH AN ANECDOTE FROM THIS WEEK IN FACT AND WE HAD A AN EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETING FOR THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL PARTNERSHIP. I'M IN IT IN CENTER TO NEW MAN ALSO AT THAT WAS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ATTEND AND SPEAK AT AND IT'S REALLY GREAT INSIDE. ONE OF THE LINES OF INQUIRY THAT CAME THROUGH WAS REFERRING TO STATION DEVELOPERS AS COMPETITORS AND- THEY STATED ONE OF THE STATE OR CITY AND- STOOD UP AND SAID YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE ARE COMPETITORS. I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT IN MY MIND AND IT IT REALLY STOOD OUT AND IT TALKED ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN THE MARKET REALLY IN A COOPERATION PHASE. A MARKET CREATION PHASE AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AT SCHOOL BIDS TO TAKE THE LEAD REALLY IN FIGURING OUT THE BEST ROUTE IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CALIFORNIA TRACKS A LOT OF THIS FEDERAL INVESTMENT. THEBILL THE WORLD'S LEADING YOU NEVER KNEW WILL GREEN HYDROGEN HUB. AND TAKING A STEP BACK THIS ONE IS TALKING A LITTLE BIT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND- TO HAVE GO BASED YOU IT MEANS YOU KNOW DRIVING TOWARDS CONSENSUS WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU KNOW ACROSS ALL OF OUR AGENCIES. AND THAT PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AND WORKFORCE ALL THIS IT MEANS ENABLING. OUR PRIVATE CAPITAL TO SCALE THE MARKET AND IT'S REALLY A FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTATION YOU DO A LOT OF WORK ON BERMAN STREAMLINING AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS. INVESTMENT TRANSLATES INTO STEEL IN THE GROUND AND A GROWING MARKET PLACE. THE SENATE REGULATED MENTIONS DAY I'M THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND I JUST. BUT IT'S GOOD TO PUT IS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA READ THROUGH THAT LANGUAGE HERE BUT WE JUST HIGHLIGHTED IT THE PLACES WHERE CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF STRENGTH IT'S IN THE RENEWABLES. YOU KNOW IT'S AN ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRIAL NET AND PARTICULARLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FOR WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK. FOR US. AND YOU KNOW YOU REALLY CALIFORNIA IS. IN A VERY STRONG POSITION- AS THEY- AS A- TO WIN A- OF THIS. IN THIS IS IT A SLIGHT BIT IS THAT THE DEAL WE- TOGETHER. AND RESPOND TO THE HIGH TO IT I DON'T. SHOT AND IT'S HAVE. AND IF YOU LOOK IT THIS THAT'S THE- OUT YOU HAVE A- REGION'S. ALTHOUGH AND BANNED. AND SO IN CALIFORNIA HOW BY FAR THE MOST RESPONSES. AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S CALLED OUT IN THIS CALIFORNIA REALLY IS RATHER EARLY MARKET IS. SPECIALLY WORK RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. AND IT I WANNA REMIND US YOU KNOW WE NEED A NATIONAL MARKET SIXTY FOR THIS ALL THE BEEF OF TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT IN MANY WAYS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO GREEN HYDROGEN THE NATIONAL MARKET NEEDS CALIFORNIA SIXTY. AND I THINK AS YOU HERE THIS MORNING WE REALLY HAVE A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES I THINK YOU KNOW FIRST OFF ARE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND HEAR FROM ANY OF THEM IS AMAZING. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN ENERGY BEHIND THAT- OUR POLICY ENVIRONMENT THINGS THAT IT LEADERSHIP THE LEGISLATURE ENDED AND- AND- ADMINISTRATIONS. THIS CURRENT AND PAST IS REALLY ROBUST. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE BIGGEST REALLY MARKET. IT'S REALLY UNDENIABLE AS FAR AS THIS PLACE IS GOING TO. THINK ABOUT IT WHEN WE WANT TO GET. OUT OF THIS IS THAT AS THE STATE. I THINK IT'S THREE FOR. THAT I HAVE TEN YEARS. GETS SORRY THIS IS. BUT THAT. YOU KNOW REALLY IT'S TIME. IT'S MONEY AND THAT'S ENOUGH THEY AND THAT'S- OUT NUMBER HOPE THIS BETTER. MONEY WE CAN LAUGH. IN A WAY THAT IT. OUR TRANSIT TO ZERO. I HAVE. URBAN TRANSPORT. ENTITIES I'M MONEY SIDE WERE. AFTER A FINANCIALLY SELF SUSTAINING EXPANDING LOW CARBON FREE HYDROGEN MARKET AND REALLY. INDUSTRY TELLS US IS THE ONLY PLACE BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT YOU CAN REALLY HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS AN INNOVATION OUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU WANT CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN HUB TO. ACCELERATE GLOBAL ADOPTION. OF LEAN HYDROGEN SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE NATIONAL NETWORK IT'S SUCCESSFUL THAT WE'RE PARTNERING WITH HUBS ACROSS THE NATION TO DO THIS BILL. AND THE INNOVATION IS YOU KNOW BOTH IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION BUT IT'S ALSO POLICY INNOVATION. AND ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION. AND YOU'LL HEAR YOU KNOW FROM THE UC SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE. AND HOW WE CAN PULL THAT TOGETHER. I THINK EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE BUILT ON OUR CORE PRINCIPLES AND SO AS A STATE IF IT GROUP OF AGENCIES WE GOT TOGETHER TO DRAFT A FEW WET WINTER FOR PRINCIPLES FOR. HYDROGEN WE'RE PRIORITIZING ZERO LOW CARBON HYDROGEN OR GREEN HYDROGENS THAT INCLUDES YOU KNOW BROAD DEFINITION. REALLY FOCUS IN ON CARBON INTENSITY- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN THE SYSTEM. TAKING A MULTI SECTORAL APPROACH THE OPTIC THAT YOU'LL HEAR A LOT EVEN FOR THREE HUNDRED A COALITION ABOUT HOW THAT. PULLS TOGETHER- IT'S THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC POLICY ENABLES REALLY MARKETS AND PRIVATE CAPITAL REALLY SCALES THAT. AND WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE THE HARDEST TO BATES SECTORS WITH THE BIGGEST EMISSIONS PROFILES AND THAT'S OF. HYDROGEN SWEET SPOT AND REALLY FOCUS ON READING ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE MARK AT THIS. YOU KNOW ALL INCLUDES- YOU KNOW. ROBUST WORKFORCE AND CREATING ACTED THAT ACCESS IS LIKE HE SAID SENATOR ARCHULETA. FINALLY WE WANNA MAKE SURE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON COMMUNITIES OF. THE LARGEST POLLUTION- AND SO WHAT ARE THE HARDEST TO BE EXACT. I BUT FORCE A LOT OF WORK ON THAT AT HERB HAS. A RESOURCE FOR AND MAY WORK ON THIS BILL BE PLAN. I'M NOT GONNA THROUGH ALL THE OF THIS% LIFE AT THE IS FROM MODEL- AND SO YOU KNOW WHERE DO WE NEED. NEEDED NEEDED ELECTRIC ELECTRIC POWER WE NEED AN INDUSTRIAL. AND THEN ALL OF THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE HYDROGEN IS ENERGY STORAGE THAT'S REALLY ACROSS SECTORS THANKS WE'VE GOT INTO DETAILS BUT- EVERYTHING GOING FORWARD WILL BE BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION. OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL BEING PLANNED OF SB ONE HUNDRED ANALYSIS. TO MAKE SURE THAT HYDROGEN IS BEING PUT TO ITS BEST. AND THEN. WHAT'S THE STATE'S ROLE IN THE APPLICATION AND PARTICULARLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ROLE AND THAT'S IT. I'M WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. WE REALLY NEED TO SET CLEAR OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA FOR STATES THE FORKS. WHO FIND THE PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA HAS A ROBUST BUDGET. THAT PUTS US IN A IN A HUGE ADVANTAGE TO COMPARED TO OTHER STATES- YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO. CONNECT PARTY STANFORD COLLABORATION THIS IS ONE OF THE RISING TIDE LIFTS ALLBOATS AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL OF US ARE TRYING TO BUILD AN ECOSYSTEM THAT WILL DRIVE. A FOR A LONG TIME. RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR APPLICATION IS POSITIONED TO WIN. I'M IN YEAH THAT MEANS CONNECTING THE DOTS COMMUNICATING WHY CALIFORNIA AND THEN IT'S BRINGING REGIONAL PARTNERS WITH OUR NEIGHBORING STATES. I'M TO GO BEARS ARE ROLE YOU KNOW THE LEAD ORGANIZER BUT IT'S REALLY IN COLLABORATION AND CONSENSUS WITH MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND PARTNERS SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY. AND OUR TARGET YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THIS IS HAVING ONE UNIFIED. STATE WIDE STATE ENDORSED AND WHO FIND THAT APPLICATION. WITH YOU KNOW REGIONAL SPECIFICITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOSE ANY OF THAT MONEY COMING IN AND SO THAT THAT. THIS REGIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES CREATE. BROADER OPPORTUNITY PLUS STATE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE BRING IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND THE GOAL IS RE AGNES FAR AS THIS IS. IT'S ORGANIZATION IS BUILDING A SELF SUFFICIENT MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WITH CLEAR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WILL THRIVE LONG INTO THE FUTURE AS LONG AS IT'S NEEDED AND THEN DISSOLVED WHEN THE MARKET. FORCES ULTIMATELY TAKE OVER. AND THOUGH. THIS WHEN I PRAY SHOULD MAKE THIS LITTLE EIGHTY EIGHT. BUT I. THIS HELPS LIKE HOW WE THINK ABOUT THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH. CIRCLE OF WE ARE PROUD TO PROPOSE IN THE MID THESE OF THE A LOT OF- IF YOU'RE FROM. WHO ARE OR- STAPLE. TRYING TO IT YOU KNOW AROUND THIS OPPORTUNITY. MANY LATER AND SUPPLIERS WHO HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER TO THE AND MARKETPLACE VIA. ELECTROLYZER SUPPLIER. AT THE HIDERS FLYER VEHICLE SUPPLIERS- WITH. ALL THE END END IT'S THE DEMAND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DEMAND IS THERE. AND PULLING ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER WE MADE IT POOREST BECAUSE THESE ALL HAVE TO INTERACT BUT IT'S REALLY GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROJECT PROPONENT. IN MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IS CLEAR. YOU ON THE STATE SIDE WE NEED TO SEND A CLEAR SIGNALS. GET MONEY TO ENABLE THAT HELPS THAT I'M ORGANIZED. AT THAT STAKEHOLDERS I'M INDUSTRY CITING US REALLY RESPONDING TO MARKET NEEDS RESPONDING TO STATE POLICY NEED IT'S MATCHING SUPPLY AND DEMAND. BUT BOTH OF US NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTATION THIS NEEDS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I'M IN SO I IN TERMS OF FUNDING WE JUST ORGANIZED YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WITHIN IS WITHIN OUR CURRENT AUTHORITY AS THE ADMINISTRATION TO PUT FORWARD I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH AND ALL THE DETAILS BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES BECOME FULL FROM AND HAVE TO BE SURE THE SLIDES AFTER TO BE GREAT TO WORK OBVIOUSLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION VEHICLES FROM HARPER WE ALSO HAVE YOU KNOW HOW FIRE HEALTH HEALTHY FORCES OR THAT- DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION OF BIOMASS. ENERGY STARTED LATER THESE THINGS ONLINE AND IT CREATES A LOT OF PRETTY COMPELLING STORY THAT WE CAN PERSPECTIVES HERE AND- YOU KNOW PROVIDE THAT OF COURSE THERE'S THE CALIFORNIA BLUEPRINT PLAN WITH THE GOVERNOR- AN OUNCE IN JANUARY AN ENEMY REVISED COMING UP WITH THAT HAD MONEY FOR ELECTROLYSIS WHICH IS ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT AND pWE'RE THINKING WE'RE ALSO THINKING BEYOND MONEY YOU KNOW. WE BRING A LOT TO THE TABLE AT THE STATE YOU KNOW IT'S THE MARKET CERTAINTY FROM OUR REGULATIONS IT'S WORKING ON A MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT THREE DTS WHERE WE HELP TRANSIT AGENCIES- HAVE CLEAR TRANSPARENCY IN THE HYDROGEN PRICING THE MATCHING SUPPLY AND DEMAND YOU KNOW IT'S THE PERMIT STREAMLINING WORK AND THEN THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW OTHER STUFF IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IN DEVELOPMENT THINKING THAT'S THE HEADLINE INJECTION AT THE TERROR FOR ELECTROLYSIS IS KIND OF TO BE DETERMINED BUT RATHER THINKING ABOUT BUILDING CODES YOU KNOW PERHAPS MAKING SURE THAT. ARE RECYCLED WATER IS AVAILABLE ONSITE FOR EXAMPLE FINALLY I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TIGHTENING- AND THIS YOU KNOW IT IT'S A BIT OF A MOVING TARGET YOU MAY HEAR FROM OTHERS THAT MORE RECENT INTEL BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE EXPECTING THE FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT COME OUT IN MID MAY THEY'RE THINKING YOU KNOW LAUNCH ONE WOULD BE FORTY SIX AWARDS YOU KNOW KIND OF FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO BE YOU KNOW FORTY SIX WEEKS TO RESPOND WITH A CONCEPT PAPER AND WE DO A FULL SOLICITATION- IN AT LUNCH TO- IT WOULD BE IS TO BE DETERMINED AND THREE AND BORIS KIND OF BUILDING ON THOSE LAUNCHES ONE INTO THIS HOW WE UNDERSTAND. THAT SO IF THEY IS ANYTHING TO TAKE AWAY THIS LIFE. WE TO BE IN. ONE AND WE WANT AWAY TO LUNCH BY ANYTHING WAY MAKE SURE THAT ARE ORG. AROUND THAT INGREDIENT NOT SHOPPERS. AS AND SO. WITH THAT- THERE'S MY CONTACT INFORMATION. RETREATED AS UP WITH FOR EACH. TO STATE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE AS RETHINKING ABOUT HYDROGEN STRATEGY WILL BE UP. ON STUFF OUT BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND I'LL HAND IT BACK TO YOU SENATOR ARCH ALETTA THE PANEL AND THE PEOPLE- CALLING IN. SO YOU DON'T GO AWAY. OKAY WE NEED YOU TO STAND BY. SO LET'S GO ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. AND OUR NEXT BAKER DR SCOTT BRANDT- SPECIAL ADVISER TO RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND WELCOME MISTER BRANDT OF BLOOD HAVE YOU BOARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING. LET'S SEE ONE SECOND THANK YOU. YOU FOR DIVIDING THE UNIVERSE IN CALIFORNIA THIS CONVERSATION GIVEN THE CHANCE TO SPEAK ON OUR BEHALF- MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL ADDRESS THREE QUESTIONS WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW CAN THE STATE LEVERAGE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WATCHING A CALIFORNIA PUBLICLY. AT FIRST WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND A HOST OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT'S EVIDENT IN THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLICIES PROGRAMS AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN LEADING AND OVERSEEING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE EFFORTS. CALIFORNIA'S ROADIES ARE OBVIOUS. GOVERNOR'S NEWSOM'S BLUEPRINT HIS PRIORITIES ARE EQUALLY CLEAR AS ARE THE SENTENCE BY VIRTUE OF THIS HEARING TODAY GREEN HYDROGEN IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. THAT WE SAW THIS LIGHT ALREADY. ORDERLY AND I ASSUME EVERYBODY HERE HAS SEEN IT BEFORE- IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO PUTTING HIGH PRIORITY ON CLEAN ENERGY AND HYDROGEN THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S HYDROGEN PROGRAM. THE DEAL WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO FIND A HANDFUL OF REGIONAL CLEAN HYDROGEN HUBS- IN THE WORDS OF US SECRETARY ENERGY JENNIFER GRANDHOMME. THIS IS TO SCALE UP THIS CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY SOURCE THE CLEAN UP AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND SLASH EMISSIONS FROM CARBON INTENSIVE MATERIALS WHILE CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS CALIFORNIA. BUT TAKE EXCEPTION ABOUT WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. IT DOESN'T MENTION THE CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IT DOESN'T MENTION THAT IT'S ABOUT 12% OF THE US POPULATION IT DOESN'T MENTION CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE GEOGRAPHY ECO SYSTEMS. DEMOGRAPHICS AN ECONOMY DOESN'T SAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND IT DOESN'T SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S OBJECT OBVIOUS LOCATION FOR HYDROGEN. I CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANT TO JUST KILL HER FAVOR BUT IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT THE HYDROGEN OF BELONGS HERE. SO HOW CAN THE STATE LEVERAGE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WELL YOU SEE IS THE PREMIER RESEARCH UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. IT COMPRISES TEN CAMPUSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THREE NATIONAL LABORATORIES TO IN CALIFORNIA. EXTENSIVE STATEWIDE NATURAL RESERVE SYSTEM IN AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEM AND MORE. UC'S RESEARCH ENTERPRISE REPRESENTS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION IN ANNUAL EXPENDITURES. YOU SEE HAS THE PEOPLE THE TOOLS THE BIG IDEAS INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE WILL TO HELP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDED SCREEN ENERGY GOALS. THIS IS ALSO DEEPLY COMMITTED TO CLIMATE SOLUTIONS INTO PUTTING THAT COMMITMENT INTO ACTION BY DEVELOPING ENACTING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT COMMITMENT THROUGH ITS ACTIONS INCLUDING THE UC CARBON NEUTRALTY INITIATIVE. USING GLOBAL CLIMATE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AT LEAST YOU SEE APPLIED RESEARCH WORKING GROUP. YOU SEE DOES MORE GREEN ENERGY UC USES MORE GREEN ENERGY THAN ANY UNIVERSITY IN THE NATION AND IS FULLY DIVESTED FROM FOSSIL FUELS FIRST UNIVERSITY TO DO THAT BUT I'M CERTAIN WITH LARGEST. YOU SEE PRESIDENT DRAKE IS SPECIFIED FOR PRIORITIES THAT WILL BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF HIS EVERYDAY WORK AT UC. AFFORDABILITY ACCESS EXCELLENCE IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY FOR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS THE FOURTH ONE THE FIRST THREE ARE KIND OF MOTHERHOOD AND APPLE PIE. FOR UNIVERSITIES THE FOURTH ONE IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. IN HIS WORDS AS A GLOBAL AS A NATION. IT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK TO REVERSE THE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE SEEN CHANGING ECO SYSTEM RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. AND THE UNIVERSITY IS MEANT TO BE A LEADER. UNDER PRESIDENT DRAKE AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH AND INNOVATION- DOCTOR THERESA MALDONADO. THIS IS A BRACING A COLLABORATIVE ALL OF YOU SEE APPROACH HOLD YOU SEE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE GRAND CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE IN THE NATION. THIS IS COME OUT THERE ARE DEEP PARTNERSHIP WITH THE KIDS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THE- AROUND THE STATE'S COLD RESPONSE. IT'S ALSO COME OUT MORE RECENTLY. IN THE INITIATIVE TO HELP CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU SEE IS COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH THE STATE AND OTHERS TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GREEN HYDROGEN ENERGY GOALS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS. YOU SEE IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN GREEN HYDROGEN RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT DEMONSTRATION. TO GATHER WITH THE UC MANAGE NATIONAL LEAD YOU SEE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY GREEN HYDROGEN. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING. BUT THER ARE MANY MANY EXAMPLES OF MAJOR GREEN HYDROGEN PROJECTS AROUND ONE SUCCESSFUL. AND IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT AFTER WE'RE DONE I CAN GO THROUGH MANY EXAMPLES BUT- JUST A FEW OF THE USER UC IRVINE HAS PARTNERED WITH SO CAL GAS AND OTHERS FOR NEARLY A DECADE. TO DANCING SALARY GROWTH IN GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY. UCLA IS WORKING THROUGH LA GRAND CHALLENGES INITIATIVE. OF INTELLECTUAL CITY TO A DIGITAL VERSION STORAGE. AND LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB PARTY COLLEAGUES MULTIPLE HYDROGEN ARGUED PROGRAMS FOR VIDEO WE SPENDING A PLATE TECHNOLOGIES TO BASIC RESEARCH. AND I COULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU A DOZEN MORE. THAN I'VE GOT SLIDES. WE DON'T HAVE TIME. TO GO THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU SEE PLAY PIVOTAL ROLES COULD BE A ORGAN. CATALYZE HYDROGEN HUB HUNDRED HUB. PROVIDING THE RESEARCH UNIT OF- NECESSARY TO REACH TECHNO. MARKET COMMUNITY GOALS AND PROVIDING THE TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NECESSARY TO DEVELOP ABOUT THE ROBUST WORK FORCE. TO SUPPORT EMERGING EMERGING HYDROGEN ECONOMY. SO HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS WHAT WE ENVISION- FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HOW THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP FOR CLEAN CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN NECKLACES THE- WE ENVISION ABROAD PEOPLE CENTERED COLLABORATION IT WAS PARTNERSHIP ISN'T IS KEY TO COME TO SEE AT LEAST. STATE AGENCIES WHO REPRESENT THE STATE'S INTERESTS NEUTRAL NON POP PROFITS LIKE NOBLES ONE HUNDRED POLICY INSTITUTE WE'RE FOCUSED ON OUR COMMON GOALS INDUSTRY PARTNERS WITH THE CAPACITY TO MOVE TECHNOLOGIES INTO PRACTICE AT SCALE AND WILL DO SO SPENDING PRODUCERS CONSUMERS TRANSPORTERS AND STORAGE LABOR UNIONS COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE CODES AND STANDARDS PARTNERS IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND OF COURSE YOU SEE ANOTHER CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER AT. WE ALSO IN HOUSTON VISION FOCUSED INCLUDES GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION HYDROGEN TRANSPORTATION HYDROGEN STORAGE AND HYDROGEN NEWS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. GOING FORWARD. THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK TO DO. BUT THE IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO WELL YOU'RE A STATEWIDE EFFORT INTO FOUR REALLY GOOD AT. IT INVOLVED EVERYBODY IN THIS EFFORT WE REALLY NEED TO WORK ON ESTABLISHING THE KERR CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL T. AND GO SHOOTING TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DOUBLE THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK- I THINK THAT EVERYBODY HERE HAS ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER PROPOSAL WHO THEY'RE GOING TO WORK WITH. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO A STATEWIDE EFFORT TO WORK TOGETHER WE HAVE TO START WORKING ON THAT IMMEDIATELY. AT TO DO THAT WE ENVISION A GOVERNANCE CONCEPT. WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS. AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE A SMALL. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. COMPRISING HIM FOR PRIMARY PARTNERS INCLUDING YOU SEE A FEW REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE HE CORPORATE PARTNERS AND POSSIBLY OTHERS MUCH LARGER STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING WITH BROAD REPRESENTATION- THIS IS WHERE IT BROUGHT ENGAGEMENT COMES WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE MAY HAVE SOME COMMITTEES FOCUSED ON THE AREAS OF THE PARDONS FOR EXAMPLE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY. ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMMUNITY. S. THIS IS GOING TO ENGAGE. EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED AND THEN US SUBGROUPS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC TECHNICAL AREAS RICHARD THE COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION WITH A TECHNICAL GOALS OF THE PROJECT COMES WITH. FINALLY WE'VE DEVELOPED TO SERVE NINE PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK HAS TO GOVERN- HE CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT ANY CALIFORNIA HAVE REALLY MUST BE STATEWIDE- CALIFORNIA'S GEOGRAPHICALLY ECONOMICALLY AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE AND IT'S REALLY AN IDEAL HYDROGEN TEST BED FOR THE NATION- THE CALIFORNIA MUST BE FREE CALIFORNIA'S LED THE NATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND POLICY AND GREEN HYDROGEN IS THE WAY FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA- THE CALIFORNIA HOPE. WROTE MUST HAVE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AS ITS ORIENTATION EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT GET US TO THE TWO DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM THE LEGAL NOR THAT ONE ONE ONE HYDROGEN CHUCKLE. RESEARCH AND INNOVATION HAS TO HELP DRIVERS FOR. IT MUST BE ALIGNED THE STATE INTERESTS STATE INTERESTS HAVE TO BE BUILT DIRECTLY INTO THE GOVERNANCE MODEL INSURE THAT. THE HOBBIT IS FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. I'M IT MUST HAVE THE OBJECTIVE AND UNBIASED. IT MUST REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS WE SAID CALIFORNIA HAS A REALLY DIVERSE- THE- CULTURALLY DIVERSE BASE AND WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ALL ENGAGED AT ALL STAGES- AND THAT HAS TO BE IN THE GOVERNANCE AND THEY HAVE TO BE ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND THEY HAVE TO BE PRIORITIZED OVER THE DECISION. INTEGRITY AND JUSTICE ALSO HAS TO BE CENTRAL TO THE PROCESS THROUGHOUT IT HAS TO BE PRIORITIZED IN ALL DECISIONS WITH A FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S DISADVANTAGED LOW INCOME IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. FINALLY THE WORK HAS TO BE MULTI DIMENSIONAL. WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE ALTHOUGH THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE PART OF IT THERE ARE ALSO MAJOR QUESTIONS OF POLICY ECONOMICS MARKETS. USER BEHAVIOR IN SOCIOLOGY LAW EQUITY LABOR AND-THE CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY. UNLESS IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED. IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN THE REGION. IS THE SENSE AGENCIES UTILITIES OTHER HUBS. SO THE CONCLUSION THAT IS WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS- THE BIG OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE DELETE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO POSITION CALIFORNIA'S BENCHMARK FOR THE NATION ONCE AGAIN THIS TIME ONE THREE HYDROGEN SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. YOU SEE IS A KEY RESOURCE FOR HELPING CALIFORNIA BEACHES FREE HYDROGEN GOALS OF THE DEAL WE TWO DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM TARGET IN THE U. S. HYDROGEN SHOT ONE ONE ONE CALL. THE STATE CAN PLAY A KEY LEADERSHIP ROLE. HERE ONE IN DEVELOPING AND HELPING FUND A UNIFIED CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL INTO IN ALIGNING STATE AND FEDERAL HYDROGEN PROGRAMS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S SUCCESS. AND FINALLY TOGETHER WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE EQUITABLE SUSTAIN COORDINATED AND SCIENCE AND FOR DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN HYDROGEN FOR CALIFORNIA FOR. THANK YOU- WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE- THE UNIVERSITY WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE ENTIRE STATE OBVIOUSLY SO NOW WILL GO ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER UP. AND IT'S TERRY AND MINION CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ALL TO SEE WELCOME. THANK YOU US SENATE ARCHULETA AND SENATOR NEWMAN AND I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES TO JOIN YOUR WE CAN SEE OUR I CAN'T SEE THE VOLUME THERE THE DÍAS BUT- THANK YOU FOR OF THIS CANADIAN FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WELL THANK YOU SENATOR BEN ALLEN JUST JOINED IS SO- CALL HE'S ON BOARD. A GOOD FRIEND SENATOR THANK YOU FOR JOINING AS WELL- WE JUMP RIGHT INTO THIS AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK GOBIZ FOR TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COORDINATING ALL OF US AND- AND- TAKING THE LEADERSHIP POSITION HERE I'M JUST ABOUT OUT OF THE WAY WHERE WE GO- IS QUITE A FEW SLIDES IN HERE THAT I USE AND OTHER PRESENTATIONS I'M GONNA SKIP OVER QUICKLY BUT THE STAFF WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR. STUDY AFTERWARDS SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M GOING QUICKLY ON A FEW OF THESE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- I'M- GOING TO GO. UP AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED HYDROGEN SOMEONE A SKIP THROUGH THAT- AS YOU HEARD TYSON MENTION. THAT THERE IS THIS NINE AND A HALF BILLION THAT IS GOING OUT FROM WHAT LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR. OF FOR THESE HYDROGEN HUBS- AND IT'S CLEAR WHY WE NEEDED AGAIN I'M GONNA SKIP THROUGH THIS BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT CALIFORNIA'S REALLY UNIQUELY POSITIONS FOR THIS- AS YOU'VE HEARD BOTH FROM DR BRANDON FROM TYSON- WE HAVE THE FEEDSTOCK DIVERSITY THE AND USED DIVERSITY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE'VE GOT THE LEADERSHIP POSITION- THAT- THAT. YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY MENTIONED. AND HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE RECENTLY PULLED TOGETHER WITH THE L. A. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. AND ALL TO SEE A UNDER THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES MANY OTHER PARTNERS THAT YOU SEE HERE. COMPETING FOR FUNDING THAT ALSO CAME OUT OF THAT LEGISLATION AND FUNDING LAST YEAR. FOR A BILL BACK BETTER REGIONAL. GROUNDS AND- OF THAT GROUP IS NOW POISED TO ROLL UP ITS SLEEVES AND WORK ON YET ANOTHER VERY COMPLICATED SOLICITATION WHEN THE SOLICITATION COMES OUT IN MAY. BUT THEN BY ADDING. OUR PARTNERS. FROM THE HYDROGEN COMMUNITY THAT THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR SOME TIME FOR THIS SPECIFIC PURPOSE. SO WE FEEL THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PEOPLE HERE FROM TODAY THE PEOPLE THAT- GO BILLS WORKS WITH THE OTHER NETWORKS. THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT WE HAVE A VERY POWERFUL ONE HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN HELP. DRIVE MUCH OF THE GOALS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE- THE KEYSTORE LEADERSHIP AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT- WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE RAPID EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN OUR STATE WE HAVE THESE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SET. IN POLICY. AND I THINK THAT LEADS THE NATION IT'S SO. FAIR TO SAY. AND ALTHOUGH CLICK THROUGH THESE SLIDES VERY. IN A THERE. LATER BUT HIGH. THAT CALIFORNIA I THINK SHOULD BE GIVEN A PRIORITY OR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LAID THE POLICY GROUNDWORK AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WHEN WE SUBMITTED. THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. TO THE DEAL WE A WEEK OR SO AGO- ABOUT THE HYDROGEN HUBS. WE SUGGESTED THAT PRIORITY BE GIVEN OUR SCORING THE GIVEN. TO ANY STATE THAT HAS LAID THE POLICY GROUNDWORK AND IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE NOT THAT ARE GETTING INTO THE HYDROGEN- INDUSTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME. WILL THEN HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ABOUT PERMITTING AND SITING ON. SAFETY ON ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THAT WILL DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT WILL COME OUT IN MAY. IT'S GOING TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON THINGS THAT CAN BE COMMERCIALIZEDRAPIDLY. AND THAT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'VE HAD. SUPPORT FROM. US SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS WHEN WE'VE HAD SUPPORTING LEGISLATION WHEN WE'VE HAD A WIDE VARIETY OF POLICIES WHICH OF COURSE DON'T JUST BENEFIT HYDROGEN BUT- CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN FUELS AND- TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH IN GENERAL- WHEN WE'VE SET STANDARDS THAT OF COURSE LEAD THE WORLD. AND COINCIDENTLY JUST YESTERDAY I BELIEVE IT WAS THE FOR THE BY THE MINISTRATION. REINFORCED CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE RIGHTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT- TO SET STANDARDS. FOR VEHICLES IN TERMS OF CLEAN AIR. ARE WE ALSO HAVE- BEEN DEVELOPING CLEAN FLEET ROLES AND ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST USERS OF HYDROGEN. SOLUTIONS AND HYDROGEN AND TRANSPORTATION SO I JUST DON'T THINK ANY OTHER STATE COMPARES WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE THINGS IN GENERAL- IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS THEREFORE READY TO PUT THIS KIND OF MONEY TO WORK. SO THE HYDROGEN HUB THAT WE'RE ENVISIONING OUR ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS AND DR BRAD I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT OF- OVERVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL FOR COLLABORATION. WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY FINANCE AND THEN ONE UNIQUE ASSET THAT WE HAVE HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE ALL TO SEE CAMPUS. ALL TO SEE IS A NONPROFIT THAT WAS DEVELOPED. TO TO ACCELERATE THE BLUE ECONOMY AND WE THINK HYDROGEN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT FLOW KANA- THE SLIDE DECK THEN GOES INTO THINGS THAT AGAIN MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW HOW IS HYDROGEN PRODUCED ELECTROLYSIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT. WHICH CAN BE DONE WITH- WITH- OF SOLAR AND WIND. PARTICULAR ONE UP EMPHASIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT WITH CURTAILED WIND RIGHT NOW. IS THAT THERE IS WIND THAT BLOWS AT NIGHT WHEN WE DON'T NEED THE POWER OF THE SYSTEM OPERATOR SENDS THAT OTHER STATES ARE LITERALLY STEPS INTO THE GROUND EVEN SOLAR. IS NOW BEING PRODUCED IN. GREATER QUANTITIES THAN WE CAN USE OUR AND- THERE'S ENOUGH OF HYDROGEN IN THE WASTE WATER THAT WE THROW AWAY EVERY SINGLE DAY FROM OUR SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS TO POWER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION FLEET. SO WE CAN TAKE WASTE WATER AND THIS CHART ARE- CURTAILED RENEWABLES AND MAKE HYDROGEN OF AMONG THE VERY MANY WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE DONE IN THE STATE AND DEMONSTRATED RIGHT HERE. WE ALSO THINK THAT- ALTHOUGH. WE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A- ABOUT FRESH. AND NOW GAS AND VARIOUS OF FOSSIL FUELS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ALL OF OUR HYDROGEN FUTURE COMING FROM. FOSSIL FUELS THAT BIO GASES- IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL SO TO SPEAK. IT'S RIGHT NOW GOING UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM OTHER LAND USES LANDFILLS AND AGRICULTURE AND- CONFINED FEEDLOTS AND SO FORTH. AND IT'S TWENTY SIX TIMES MORE POTENT HEAT TRAPPING GAS AND CARBON DIOXIDE. AND SO IT'S MUCH BETTER WE THINK TO TURN THAT INTO A-HYDROGEN AND MAKE USE OF THAT GAS RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO DEVELOP THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF HYDROGEN BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FOCUS ON GREEN HYDROGEN OR- WHATEVER THEIR DEFINITION IS OF HOW TO MAKE IT- AND THEN OF COURSE THE COOL. USES AT THE END USES THE CARS I DRIVE A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAR. OF THE NEW TRUCKS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COMING OUT USING AT OF COURSE STATIONARY APPLICATIONS BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE BUT LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DON'T GET IT FROM WHERE IT'S PRODUCED TO WHERE. IT'S CONSUMED OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO RUN INTO BOTTLENECKS AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL. STORAGE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE HYDROGEN AS A MEANS OF STORAGE EVERYONE THINKS BATTERIES WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT STORING. INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES OR EVEN FOR TIME VARIANT PRICING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT HYDROGEN IS SOMETHING WHICH I CAN ALSO BE USED. AND UNLIKE BATTERIES DOESN'T DEGRADE I THINK ANYONE WHO'S LEFT THEIR CAR FOR TOO LONG IN THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT AND COME OUT THE BATTERY IS DEAD KNOWS THAT BATTERIES DEGRADE SO- HYDROGEN WHAT STORE DOES NOT. AND DEEP DECARBONIZATION HEARD FROM DR GRANT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT CALIFORNIA'S- OF LARGER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS FOR INTEGRATING HYDROGEN INTO THAT. LIGHT DUTY TRANSPORTATION WE ALREADY HAVE- FOURTEEN THOUSAND. OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THOSE OUR TRUCKS ANOTHER HUNDRED BOSSES THE ROADSTER LIGHTER DUTY. AND. AND IT'S GROWING AFTER THE WAY THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL. COMPONENT WELL IN MANY SAY THAT. ARE TACKLE. MORE EFFICIENT. BOUGHT OF NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN PLUG IN AT NIGHT AT HOME OR IN THE OFFICE DURING THE DAY. SO IF WE WANT TO GET ELECTRIC VEHICLES INTO THE HANDS OF EVERYBODY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DIVERSIFY. OF THE FUEL FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND SUPPORT REMEMBER THAT A FUEL CELL VEHICLE IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE JUST LIKE A BATTERY CAR. IT'S JUST THAT IT STORES THE ENERGY AS HYDROGEN RATHER THAN IN A BATTERY. AND WHEN WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK A YEAR OR SO AGO TO WIN THE TEXAS POWER GRID. WENT DOWN FOR DAYS OF COURSE PUT THEM IN THE DARK IF EVERYONE HAD BEEN DRIVING A TESLA AND- IN TEXAS. THEY WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN- WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION SO I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSIFYING OUR ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY THOSE WHO DON'T TYPICALLY CARE FOR THE LIGHT DUTY APPLICATIONS OF HYDROGEN EVEN THEY WILL AGREE THAT THE HEAVY DUTY. YOU CAN EITHER MOVE GOODS AND CARGO OR BATTRIES BUT NOT BOTH BECAUSE BATTERIES TAKE UP TOO MUCH WEIGHT SPACE. AND BUT- TAKE LONG HOURS FOR RECHARGING SO WHAT'S VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. SO IMPROVING THE- ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION OF HEAVY DUTY WITH HYDROGEN IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. AND THEN OF COURSE MARITIME AVIATION AND RAIL- WITH LIQUID HYDROGEN WITH OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTING IT FROM WHERE IT'S PRODUCED TO WHERE IT IS CONSUMED- PRESENTS TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. AND- CLEANER ENERGY. L. HANDLING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FUEL CELL. IN THE U. TODAY THAT WAS AS OF TWENTY TWENTY MORE EVERY DAY. LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE CONTAINER HANDLING EQUIPMENT IMPORTS. TO HELP CLEAN UP THE AIR ELECTRIFY THOSE SOURCES AS WELL- I ONE OF THEM JUST HIGHLIGHT BRIEFLY AS I MENTIONED I'M THE CEO OF ALL TO SEE IN THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES. THIS PENINSULA THAT YOU SEE HERE IF YOU CAN SEE MY POINTER. IS OUR CAMPUS AND THESE ARE HUNDRED YEAR OLD HISTORIC WAREHOUSES THAT WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF RENOVATING FACT I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BACKGROUND NOISE THERE'S- CONSTRUCTION GOING ON HERE AT THE MOMENT. TO RENOVATE THESE HUNDRED YEAR OLD- FACILITIES INTO A- A COMMERCIALIZATION CAMPUS FOR BOTH HYDROGEN AND THE BLUE ECONOMY. AND SO WITH THE UNIVERSITY PARTNERS- COLLEGE PARTNERS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH. TO INVENT THIS FUTURE IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AND HYDROGEN- THAT'S WHAT THESE. WAREHOUSES WILL BE USED FOR AND THEN WE HAVE THIS LARGE FIFTEEN ACRE SITE THAT IRONICALLY USED TO BE AN OIL TANK FARM. AND OTHER TANK'S BEEN REMOVED THAT'LL BE CLEANED UP AND THAT GIVES US A PLACE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE PRODUCE HYDROGEN. WITH THE TWO POINT TWO MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ON OUR ROOFTOP. AND SEA WATER OR WASTE WATER AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. WE COULD PRODUCE IT HERE ON SITE AND THEN. FUEL SHIPS ON HARBOR CRAFT ON ONE SIDE AND TRUCKS AND- CONTAINERIZED VESSELS ON THE OTHER. HERE WE ARE IN THE PORT OF. LOS ANGELES TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE. AND WHEN RENOVATIONS COMPLETE OUR WAREHOUSES WILL LOOK LIKE THIS WHERE INNOVATORS CAN COME IN AND BUILD THEIR PROTOTYPES DEMONSTRATE THAT SCALE. OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AND THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY. WE ALSO HAVE ROLE UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AND BOB BALLARD FOUND THE TITANIC HE IS- LEADER IN UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AND SENSORS OF COURSE AND IS WORKING WITH US ON HYDROGEN FUEL CELL OF VESSELS. AND THIS IS THE- SCIENCE EDUCATION CENTER IN FACT WERE- HOPING THAT THE STATE WILL OF SUPPORT SOME OF THE RENOVATION OF THIS. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE WILL HAVE- LABS AND- CLASS. OF FOR UNITS. TO WORKING ON THE BOOK AND HYDROGEN ECONOMY MENTION WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE MAKING THIS A RESILIENCE CENTER INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T GET INTO THAT JUST NOW BUT THESE WILL BE OF THESE WAREHOUSES WILL BE A PLACE THAT IN EMERGENCIES WILL BE POWERED BY. CLEAN ENERGY ARE ALSO WANT TO MENTION FINALLY THAT WE'VE ATTRACTED THE INTEREST OF THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AND WILL BE BUILDING A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- HYDROGEN FUTURE FUND WITH OTHER INVESTORS FROM HERE IN CALIFORNIA NEW YORK THAT A PLEDGE TO DO THIS ALONGSIDE A HYDROGEN BOMB. SO GOVERNMENT MONEY CAN BE USED FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR INITIAL COMMERCIALIZATION BUT THEN WE NEED INVESTORS TO COME ALONGSIDE AND ACTUALLY- INVEST IN THAT FUTURE. SO I THINK I JUST TOOK MY TIME WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AGAIN WILL MAKE THIS A DECK AVAILABLE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ONE TIME COSTS. WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND PLEASE STAY WITH US BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AND- WHAT A GREAT PRESENTATION FROM- ALL TO SEEAN END YOURSELF. NEXT UP WE HAVE- JANICE LYNN WHO IS THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION. OF THIS THEN ARE YOU THERE. THE CAN YOU HEAR ME THERE YOU GO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. THANK YOU SENATORS I. KNOW GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN ME. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIGH DELOS ANGELUS HOW ARE ARCHITECTING THE GREEN HYDROGEN ECOSYSTEM FOR A DEEPLY DECARBONIZE LA. I WANT TO- JUST EMPHASIZE AGAIN AND ADD ON TO Y. CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE IS A GREAT PLACE. FOR A GREEN HYDROGEN UP AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON ONE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS THERE WERE ALSO QUITE AHEAD OF THE GAME- WHEN I PLAN TO DO TODAY IS TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION ARE WORK TO DATE. AND WHERE WE PLAN TO GO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WITH THAT WE'LL GET STARTED SO REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE HUGE FEVER FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE EDUCATIONAL NONPROFIT WE WORK. THROUGHOUT THE US BUT PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE WESTERN UNITED STATES OUR MISSION IS TO FACILITATE POLICIES AND PRACTICES. TO ADVANCE THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN ALL SECTORS WHERE DOES XCELERATED CARBON FREE ENERGY FUTURE- I FOUNDED THE G. H. TWENTY NINETEEN- I ACTUALLY WITH THE MEETING THAT WAS HOSTED BY TYSON AND GO VISIT IN SACRAMENTO. AND FROM THE BEGINNING THE G. H. C. S. FOCUS IS TO ACCELERATE THE GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY. BY LEVERAGING MULTI SECTORAL OPPORTUNITIES TO SIMULTANEOUSLY SCALE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUR PURPOSE IS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE ALL ABOUT ACCELERATING CLEAN AND JUST ENERGY TRANSITION- I DO WANT TO DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY GREENHYDROGEN- WE ARE BIG FANS OF CARBON INTENSITY AND WE HAVE A BROAD DEFINITION. AND THAT IS HYDROGEN THAT IS NOT PRODUCED WITH FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS AND HAS CLIMATE INTEGRITY MEANING ZERO OR TO MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PRIOR SPEAKERS FOR RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL OF NOT ONLY ARE ABUNDANT RENEWABLE ENERGY HERE IN THE STATE BUT ALSO WERE ABUNDANT ORGANIC WASTE FEEDSTOCKS NOT ONLY. BY GAS BUT ALSO BIOMASS. DID YOU CHEER FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY A BROADER RANGE. OF GENEROUS DONATIONS- TRULY REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS AUSTRALIA JAPAN GERMANY. IN EVERY. STAKEHOLDER ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN. IN TERMS OF ARE IN. IN ADDITION I MANAGED ABOUT IDEAL NORTH IN. ON IN A SECOND BUT WE HAVE TO KEY INITIATIVES ONE IS THE WESTERN GREEN HYDROGEN INITIATIVE WHICH IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE GHC NAZARIO THE WESTERN INTERSTATE ENERGY BOARD AND THIS IS A STATE. AND PROVINCIAL LEAD ACTIVITY TO FOCUS ON REGIONAL CLEAN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. IDEAL NORTH AMERICA IS OUR COMMERCIALIZATION PLATFORM TO ACCELERATE- LOW COST MASS SCALE DELIVERED GREEN HYDROGEN IN TARGETED LOCATIONS I DO WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR OTHER WESTERN GREEN HYDROGEN ISSUE THERE- DR ANDREW MCALLISTER- CDC COMMISSIONER. HAS SERVED AS ITS VICE CHAIR SINCE THE BEGINNING ALONG SIDE OUT WYOMING AND MONTANA AND I COMMERCIAL PLATFORM HIGH DEAL AND- WAS THE FIRST HIGH DEAL PLATFORM LAUNCHED IN EUROPE BY ONE OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS. THE IDEA BEHIND HIGH DEAL AMBITION WAS TO ACHIEVE LOW DELIVERED COST- THE IDEA WAS TO FORGET A LOW DELIVERED COST WHERE YOU KNOW YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION IN EUROPE THEY TARGETED ONE FIFTY EURO PER KILOGRAM DELIVERED. AND THEN WORK BACKWARDS FIGURE OUT WHAT'S AT WHAT SCALE WHAT THE OUR SYSTEM PLAN AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE THAT LOW DELIVERED COST ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN EUROPE AS I'M JUST LITERALLY TWO WEEKS AGO THEY ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF HIGH DEAL ESPANA. WHICH IS A FUNDED ARE VERY LARGE GREEN HYDROGEN HUB SIX POINT SIX MILLION TONS OF GREEN HYDROGEN OVER TWENTY YEARS ELECTROLYTIC WE PRODUCED WAS SEVEN POINT FOUR GIGAWATTS OF ELECTROLYSIS PRODUCTION. TO START IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. PART OF THE REASON WHY I PERSONALLY EXCITED ABOUT GREEN HYDROGEN IS THAT IT'S WITH GREEN HYDROGEN WITH REIMAGINE AND REPURPOSE THE ENERGY SYSTEM. THAT WE RELIED ON FOR THE LAST CENTURY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF THE VALUE CHAIN- WILLING GAS WE CAN RE USE SOME CARD FOR ALL OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THIS NEW LITTLE TINY POWERFUL MOLECULE. AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE PRIOR SPEAKERS IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEEPLY DECARBONIZE ECONOMY WIDE GOING AFTER THE SECTORS THAT ARE VERY HARD. TO DECARBONISE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE SO WHEN YOU GO THROUGH- FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY KNOWS TODAY THE GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY IS NOT HERE BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE THIS IS A OUR COSTS FOR ALL IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION COSTS NOT A DELIVERED COST. COMPARING GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE GREEN BARS IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD COMPARING THE DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM PRODUCTION COSTS COMPARED TO BLUE AND GRAY HYDROGEN. IN THE BLUE AND GRAY BOXES AS YOU CAN SEE ACROSS THE WORLD IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ITS GRAMBLING COUNTERPARTS THAT'S THE SITUATION TODAY BUT EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AGREES. THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE CERTAINLY BY TWENTY FIFTY GREEN HYDROGEN WILL BE THE LOW COST ALTERNATIVE. AS SHOWN BY THE- GREEN. GREENS AND DASHES OVERREACH AND COMPRESSED THAT REALIZATION WE CANNOT WAIT TILL TWENTY FIFTY. WE HAVE A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM THE REASON THAT GREEN HYDROGEN SO EXPENSIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT SCALED IT. IS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AND BILLABLE TODAY BUT WE HAVEN'T SCALED IT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SCALED IT WE DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY STORAGE AND TRANSPORT AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR LOW DELIVERED COST SO THE ANSWER IS YOUR SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY MARKET DESIGN BECAUSE IT'S ONE HUNDRED COSTS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILL OUT TO APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURE OUR MARKET AND APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATE FOR ALL THE BENEFITS AND THIS COULD YIELD A VERY HUGE IMPACT AT THE TIME THAT HE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT WHERE TO START WITH HERBS WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS. ON THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND DECIDED THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE- AMONG THE TOP TOP PRIORITIES FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION THAT EXIST HERE WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE FIVE TOPS MOPPED UP SOURCES OF SMOG IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALL FIVE OF THEM CAN BE ADDRESSED BY GREEN HYDROGEN INCLUDING AVIATION RAIL AND OF LONG LONG HOMERIC TIME SHIPPING. AS JERRY MENTIONED. OUR VISION WITH HIGH DEAL. WAS TO ESTABLISH NORTH AMERICA'S. GREEN HIGH G. INTO HIGH ADDS. THE FIRST TO ACHIEVE A 100% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY THE CARBONIZED OIL REFINING REDUCE SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVE DECARBONISE FUELS FOR SHIPPING AND AVIATION MAYBE SOMEDAY TO PRODUCE FERTILIZER HERE FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS. DEMONSTRATE ZERO CARBON YOURSELF LIGHT AND SOMEDAY EXPORT MASCHIO GREEN HYDROGEN WITH THE FLAG OF JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. SEWER CREW WHICH IS TO START WITH OFFICERS. ON IN AND THIS IS REALLY ACTUALLY FINDING AND I THINK IMPORTANT FOR ANY. JOB ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY- TO REALLY GET STARTED IT STARTS WITH THE OFF TAKERS YOU NEED BANKABLE ONCE AND IMPORTANTLY OFF TAKERS THAT ARE WILLING TO GO FIRST. AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCALE. SO WE STARTED IN THE LA BASIN AND OUR- APPROACH WAS CAN WE ACHIEVE SIMILAR EUROPE THEY WENT AFTER ONE FIFTY EURO CAN WE GET YOU. A DOLLAR FIFTY- WE STARTED THIS EFFORT FOR PHASE ONE IN MAY OF LAST YEAR WE RECRUITED AN AMAZING PANEL A VERY DIVERSE PANEL OF SUPPORTING PARTNERS AND ADVISORS WILL SHOUT. OUT TO TYSON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. YOUR SUPPORT AND- OVER THE LAST YEAR A HALF. AND I BASICALLY IN PHASE ONE WE SET OUT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. IS IT A CRAZY IDEA CAN WE ACHIEVE A DOLLAR FIFTY PER KILOGRAM DELIVERED. BUT WITH THAT THE MAN LOOKS LIKE FROM WHICH OFTEN OCCURS WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS NEEDED AND WHAT ARE THE POLICY AND REGULATORY BARRIERS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SITTING HERE TODAY WE COMPLETED PHASE ONE AND NUMBER OF LAST YEAR WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH THESE TWO WHICH ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT FIRST ON PHASE ONE FINDINGS I DID WANT TO SHARE. THAT THIS IDEA IS ENTIRELY ACHIEVABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY WE CONTINUE. UNDER TWO DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM DELIVERED BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THE NECESSARY ASK YA INFRASTRUCTURE. WE FOUND IT WAS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH THE 1100% GREEN HYDROGEN PIPELINE CONNECTED TO UNDERGROUND GEOLOGIC STORAGE IN THE NEAR TERM AND THE MEDIUM TERM WE CAN GET STARTED SOONER. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME WE CAN DO IN BASS AND ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTION. WILL BE MASS SCALE WE CAN DO SOME BLENDING AN INJECTION IN THE EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE BUT AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE MASS SCALE. EITHER BECAUSE THERE'S A LIMITS. HERE'S AN OVERVIEW OF OUR HAN HE- DESIGN AT THE END PHASE ONE SURE HERE- THE LEFT THE OFF TAKERS CAN BE FOUND IN THE SMALL BLACK BOX. AND ON THIS GREEN LINE INDICATES A BI DIRECTIONAL 100% HYDROGEN PIPELINE THAT CONNECTS. ON VERY LARGE MULTI SECTORAL OFF TAKERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. REUVEN UNDERGROUND SALT DOMES IN CENTRAL UTAH THAT'S THE LARGEST PROVEN FALL DOWN IT HAS BASICALLY UNLIMITED STORAGE. THERE NEED BE SALT FORMATIONS IN SOUTHERN NEVADA IF WE WERE ABLE TO USE CLOSER SADDAM FORMATIONS. FROM ABOUT THIRTY FIVE CENTS AND THE DELIVER COST THIS IS AN END TO AND COST- SO PROVEN TOTALLY ACHIEVABLE TODAY IS A DOLLAR NINETY FIVE PER KILOGRAMME DELIVERED THAT'S WITH NO INCENTIVES- NOTHING IT'S A PURE COST- AT SCALE PROJECTION. ENTER CAN WITH WHAT THE GOP IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE SHOW HERE IN THE MIDDLE IS A IS THAT EXPANDED VIEW OF THIS SMALL AREA. CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT WE HAVE OFF TAKERS NOT ONLY IN AND AROUND THE PORT OF LA PORT OF LONG BEACH AND AROUND LOS ANGELES BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY IN VICTORVILLE IN BAKERSFIELD AND IT ALSO SHOWS IN THESE RED CIRCLES THAT WE'VE UNDENGE. RENEWABLE RESOURCE OUR STUDY FOR PHASE ONE WITH LIMITED LECTURE LYTIC PATHWAY IS ONLY JUST FOR BY VIRTUE OF SCOPE. ON THIS IS A ONE TO THREE MILLION METRIC TON MULTI SECTORAL DEMAND PRODUCTION PRODUCTION PER YEAR. BY TWENTY THIRTY SERVICES- THIS VIEW WOULD REQUIRE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT THAT'S AN END TO AND COST INCLUDING UPSTREAM PRODUCTION FOR EXPORTS DURING COMPRESSION. I WANT TO RIGHT SIZE THAT INVESTMENT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FIRST OF ALL MISTER MEMBER A LOT OF IT WILL BE COMING FROM PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT IT REPRESENTS ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES WITH FANS OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD I WANTED TO VOTE MY LAST MINUTE TO TALKING ABOUT THESE TWO IN WHAT WE'RE UP TO NEXT. WE ARE JUST ABOUT TO LAUNCH ON FACED YOU HAVE HIGH DEAL L. A. AS SHOWN BY THIS BAR ON THE TOP. AND ON NEXT STEPS WILL HAVE BASICALLY A COUPLE OF REALLY BIG FOCUS AREAS ONE IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY VALUE PROPOSITION WE HAVE A VISION FOR WHERE TO GO. THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS TO GET FROM A TO B. AND PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THE COMMUNITY. I IS TO EXPAND OUR GREEN HYDROGEN OXYGEN CONTENT SO WE DID NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS FOR MARITIME SHIPPING AVIATION. AND WE NEED TO DO DEEPER DIVES ON THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT IS THAT NO REGRETS INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO INVEST IN TUESDAY. TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS. OUR WORK WILL BE. IN FOR MAJOR MAJOR WERE STREAMS IN OUT WE YOU INTO TO CORPS. VERY CLOSELY WITH EVERY ON CALL LOCAL. AND REGIONAL. AND OUR OUR GOAL IS TO WORK WITH A MUCH BROADER TENT OF STAKEHOLDERS EVERY STAKEHOLDER IN THIS JOURNEY HAS AN IMPORTANT AND UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO PROGRESS. AND THE IDEA IS IF WE CAN ANSWERING INNOVATIVE AND HOW WE COME TOGETHER. AS A COMMUNITY. AND ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED WE'RE INNOVATING IN THE PLATFORM ITSELF AND THAT PLATFORM CANBE REPLICATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ULTIMATELY KNITTING TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL GREEN HYDROGEN STRATEGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS NOW AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FOLLOW- FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. AND LOOK FOR DIFFERENT COLLABORATING WITH EVERYONE ON THIS MEETING. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MRS LANE AND WE ASK YOU TO PLEASE STAY WITH US BECAUSE THERE WILL. BE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL AS WE PROCEED SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM RANDY HOWARD- GENERAL MANAGER REPRESENTING THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY. WELCOME MISTER HOWARD. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS FOR BY NICE TO PARTICIPATE IN A QUICKLY GO OVER WHAT'S GOING ON IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I ME. ME GO- ON WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO GET TO THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE ON THE PATHWAY TO HYDROGEN. C. S. AS SHOWN HERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY WHERE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE FOR THE SOUTH IS ONE POKE WE SUPPORT AND SERVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND METERS WE HAVE ONE OF THE CLEANEST- OF PORTFOLIOS OF ENERGY TO SUPPLY THOSE NEEDS AND CPA IS A POINT POWER AGENCIES SO WE BUILD OWN AND OPERATE POWER PLANTS ON BEHALF OF MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. OUT THERE HUNDRED IS GOING TO BE KEY FOR THE ROLE OF OUR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE AND TRANSITIONING JENNESS POINTED OUT FROM TRANSITION EXISTING POWER PLANTS- IN TRANSITION ROSE TO HER PERCENT CARBON FREE ENERGY SOURCE FROM NINETEEN NINETY A TRIBUTE ITS- ARM OF A- DISPATCH YLIDES FLEXIBILITY. NO NEW TRANSMISSION REQUIRED FOR THOSE FACILITIES AND LONG DURATION STORAGE A WE CAN WE CAN INTEGRATE WORTH OF RENEWABLES HOW CAN ALSO UTILIZE. ACCESS REMOVAL ENERGY FROM THE GROUP THAT SUPPORTS THE PRODUCTION OUR COMMUNITY IS REMAIN. VERY ACTIVE IN BUILDING NEW RENEWABLE ENERGIES WE SEE HERE IS THE CITY OF HILLSBORO. FLOATING SOLAR SYSTEMS THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY IT'S ON THEIR TREATMENT PLANTS WATER TREATMENT PLANT FUND IS VERY VALUABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE HOUSING THE ABILITY TO PUT SORT THEIR SELECTION UNITIES ARE STILL DOING THINGS- ONE OF OUR MEMBERS THE PORT OF OAKLAND WHAT AN ACTIVITY WITHIN THE FOR LOT OF MICRO ACTIVITY GOING ON RENEWABLE DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S STILL GOING TO OCCUR THAT STILL NECESSARY. TO SUPPORT THE HYDROGEN BUT WE ALL KNOW. WHEN THE SUN ISN'T SHINING THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO- PRODUCE POWER AND IF WE CAN. WE CAN REPURPOSE SOME OF OUR EXISTING FACILITIES SO MODI ENERGIES WE DO NOT VOTE I ENERGIES. THE WHAT I ENERGY CENTER WAS CONSTRUCTED IN. TWENTY TWELVE SO IT'S ONE TEN YEARS OLD. IT'S A THREE MEGAWATT UNIT WHICH- THE I FIVE. IT'S A SEAMAN YOU'RE IT'S ONE OF THE TO BE KIND OF. START NEEDED FILLED TO SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY IT QUICKLY RAMPS UP BEFORE RAMPS DOWN. YEAH SO IT HAS. THIS REALLY GREAT HE RATE VERY OFFICIAL COMES AND THEY ARE QUICK. YEAH AND IT'S- IN A- TO OUR KEY TRANSMISSIONS OF THE CAL SELF IT'S ALSO A CHASE. TO WESTERN- AREA POWER. TRANSMISSION SO IT'S IN SAY CAL CONNECTED TO EXISTING TRANSMISSION. IT CURRENTLY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF. 45% HYDROGEN ALMOST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS THE INSTALLATION OF AN UPGRADED TURBO IT IS CAPABLE OF CO COMBUSTION OF THE 45% HYDROGEN IS CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL THE DAY. SO WE'RE ON TRACK. TO TAKE THIS FIRST OF ITS CURRENT A TO DEMONSTRATE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. IN THE UTILITY SECTOR AND THE FINAL COMPLETION OF OUR HYDROGEN A CAPABLE TERMINAL IS EXPECTED IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO WHY WHY WHAT I CENTER ONE LONGTIME ENERGY CENTER. AS I MENTIONED IT'S LOCATED ALONG TO MAJOR TRANSMISSION OR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AS WELL AS HAS ACCESS TO RAIL. SO IT'S NEAR I FIVE AND NEAR HIGHWAY NINETY NINE. SO WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THIS A HYDROGEN CAPABLE TURMAN NOW ALREADY COMPLETE- WE ARE LOOKING TO VENT AFTER PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN SO BUILDING OUT THE ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM WITHIN THE FACILITY WE'RE J. SENT TO THE CITY OF ROAD. A WATER TREATMENT FACILITY THIS PLANT CURRENTLY USES- RECLAIMED WATER SO THIS PROJECT WILL NOT NEED TO ACCESS IN FRESH WATER SYSTEM IT HAS THAT CAPABILITY THERE'S EXCESS WATER THERE ARE TWO DAY SO HAVING A SUSTAINABLE WATER SOURCE WE THINK IT'S KEY IS SCALABLE WE HAVE A THOUSAND ACRES OF CITY LAND ADJACENT TO THE PROJECT. THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THE. EXPANSION THERE. YEAH AGAIN BEING. CLOSE TO THE PARKS OF THE NEXT WEEK NGF INSTRUCTION ALSO HI WE HAVE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CURRENTLY IS FACILITY WE HAVE UNDERGROUND STORAGE NEARBY IT WILL BE CANCELED COURT- HYDROGEN AND THAT WILL BE PART OF OUR VALUATION GOING FORWARD- LAWMAKERS. TO I HAVE THIS HUB CONCEPT SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOBBS THIS IS OUR CONCEPT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NUMBER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE THE JOINT OWNERS IN THIS PROJECT. SO ONE OF THE LARGEST OWNERS OF OUR PROJECT IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE GENERATION FROM LODI AND SHE SAID. SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY ALREADY A PARTNER IN A- AND CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO REDUCE GHG. ARM THAT'S THE ORIGINAL REASON I GOT IN THIS PLANT GETTING OUT OF SCHOOL FACILITIES WE GOT INTO THIS PLANT BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCY. AND NOW BEING ABLE TO TRANSITION THIS PLANT. TO EMISSION FREE FUEL SOURCE SUCH AS HYDROGEN. ISN'T FOR THE STATE'S GOALS AS WELL. FROM NCPA WARMTH THIS SORT OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PACIFIC HYDROGEN HUB. THE HOBBIT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COLLABORATIVE UNITY BASED. RESOURCE FOR FINDING TRAINING OF PERSONNEL AND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY THE CURRENT PARTNERS IN THIS HOUSE OR NCPA IN THE OFF TAKER MORE ARE POWER PLANTS. SIEMENS ENERGY WHICH IS OUR TECHNOLOGY PARTNER YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS HOUSE AND THIS FACILITY TO HELP WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT TO GET TO THAT 100% HYDROGEN BUT ALSO BEING ABLE TO EXPAND ON THEIR WORK WITH REDUCING THE COST AND EFFICIENCY OF ELECTROLYSIS. WELL I ITSELF WHICH IS A KEY PARTNER HERE AS THE OWNER OF THE LAND. USE OF THE WATER. AND ALSO IMPACTING THIS AREA THAT HAS A NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED. CUSTOMERS AND- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WORK OPPORTUNITIES. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IS PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE THE EXPERIENCE WAS FINE HYDROGEN BLENDED FUELS THEY'RE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATION TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW THEY WILL IMPACT HI PLAN STILL HAVEN'T DEDICATED SPACE THERE TO STUDY AND EVALUATE. HI PLANS LABOR ISSUES REGARDING WORKING WITH HYDROGEN. THE UC RIVERSIDE IS ONE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THIS THEY'RE GONNA HELP US WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE THE TECHNOLOGY SURROUNDING THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY AND THE IMPACT ON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN THE CONSULTING FIRM G. H. T. AND WE'RE GOING TO LEVERAGE THEIR INTERNATIONAL EXPERT EXPERTISE WITH ESTABLISHING HYDROGEN HUBS IN BOTH AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE. HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TRYING TO BUILD THIS OUT. SO THE EXISTING FACILITIES OR ARE THERE AND ARE OUR PROPOSAL IS TO EXPAND THOSE AT NCPA IS OWNER OPERATOR. OF GEOTHERMAL HYDRO SOLAR WIND WE SEE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE OFFSHORE WIND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FEEDING INTO THIS PROJECT AND BEING ABLE TO USE HYDROGEN GOING FORWARD. SO WE THINK IT'S IDEALLY. THERE'S A LOT ABOUT HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD- SOME OF THE BENEFITS WE THINK. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS THAT WE CAN UTILIZE AND IS JANICE POINTED OUT IN REPURPOSE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WOULD BE THE LEAST COST MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO GET TO THIS. LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND WE THINK WE CAN BE BACK QUICKLY AT OF A FACILITY LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU CENTER AGAIN BECAUSE OF ITS LOCATION IS ACESS TO TRANSPORTATION. AND- TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS SO- WERE WORKING AS WELL AREN'T COMMUNITIES FOR. A TO SHARE THE FINDINGS WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. TO GET THE COOPERATION AND THE RELATIONSHIPS WE KNOW OR CAN BE NECESSARY TO BUILD OUT. I WILL STOP THERE I LOOK FORWARD TO RESPONDING TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED WELL THANK YOU MISTER HOWARD GREAT PRESENTATION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE QUESTIONS F THE PANELISTS LAST TO STAY WITH US. AND OUR NEXT- IS NEIL NAY EVEN AND- NEIL IS THE VICE PRESIDENT CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS WITH. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. WELCOME MR NEIGHBOR. YOU NEED TO UN MUTE. THANK YOU SENATORS AND I'LL JUST BRING UP MY PRESENTATION AND NOW ERICA THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL SENATORS ARCHULETA NEWMAN IN ALLEN IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY HI MY NAME IS NEIL EVAN AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATIONS FOR SOCAL GAS AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HYDROGEN. AND HYDROGEN HUBS- I AM GOING TO. SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT ONE OF OUR PROJECTS THAT SO BILL GAS. WHICH IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO PURSUE AND WIN. A CALIFORNIA Y. ANDERSON HOW. OUR PROJECT IS CALLED ENDLESSLY. IT IS INTENDED TO BE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST GREEN HYDROGEN OF PIPELINE. AND WE EXPECTED TO BE A KEY PART OF SUPPORTING ANY LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENT OF HYDROGEN IN THE ECONOMY CALIFORNIA. SO GAS AS YOU LIKELY KNOW IS A- HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR OLD COMPANY THAT SERVES. OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE WE ARE ACTUALLY THE LARGEST- GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE- WE VERY RECENTLY PUT TOGETHER A PLEDGE TO BE JUDICIALLY NEUTRAL BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE THE PLAN RECALLS WHERE TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND THAT PLAN IS UNDERPINNED BY ED AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IT REALLY PUTS HYDROGEN. AT THE CENTER OF THAT PLAN. WHEN WE WENT TO UNDERTAKE OUR EFFORTS TO LOOK AT- HOW GOOGLE GAS AS AN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY COULD SUPPORT. A HYDROGEN HUB. LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO. LOOK AT SOME KEY PRINCIPLES THAT WE THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN ANY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. IN ANY PROJECT THAT ADVANCES CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS ONE THAT IT ACTIVELY AND- VERY DISTINCTLY SUPPORT THE WIDER CLIMATE GOALS OF THE STATE. BUT ALSO THAT IT'S SPECIFICALLY SUPPORT THE CLEAN AIR GOALS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND MANUFACTURING SCALE GREEN HYDROGEN- DEPLOYMENT WE ULTIMATELY ONCE WE'RE WORKING AT SCALE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE HARD TO ELECTRIFY THE FUNDING IS MANY OTHERS OF WEIRD TO ME TO MENTION. THOSE ARE- TRANSPORTATION ESPECIALLY HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION- WHITE INDUSTRY HEAVY INDUSTRY THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT NEED PROPERTIES OF HEAT. AND LASTLY DISPATCHABLE ELECTRIC IN A RESEARCH SUPPORTING OUR ALREADY ABUNDANT TRADITIONAL RENEWABLE DISPATCHABLE ENERGY. WE BELIEVE THAT ANY EFFORT IN THIS CASE THE EFFORT AROUND OUR ANGELES LINK PROJECT NEEDS TO INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ARTUR'S OFF TAKERS SUPPLIERS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY REGULATORS AND LEGISLATORS HAVE A CLEAR VOICE IN EVERY STEP OF THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE. ARE ENDLESSLY PROJECT ALSO HAS THE FULL BENEFITS OF OPENINGUP THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE DEPLOYMENT OF A CLEAN MODE FEELS THAT MIGHT IN THE FUTURE HELP FACILITATE THE RETIREMENT OF THE LEASE OF IN. WHAT IS ENDLESSLY ENDLESS LENGTH IS A GREEN HYDROGEN FIVE ONE PROPOSAL. AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL IT WOULD SEEK TO USE THE CURRENTLY CURTAILED IN NEW BUILD SOLAR AND WIND THAT'S WHAT THE HELL FOR HIS OWN FAMOUS FOR OVER. TO BREAK APART WATER. INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN WITH ELECTROLYSIS IN MOVE THAT IN A DEDICATED GREEN HYDROGEN PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE. FROM THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE ABUNDANT IN IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES. TO THE CENTRAL HEART OF THE L. A. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIAL BASE SO ESSENTIALLY OF THE LA BASED. WE NEED WHEN WE DO THIS AT SCALE THE PROJECT LIKE ENDLESSLY HAS THE CAPABILITY TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE. FOR GHG REDUCING THE GST IMPACT OF THE STATE REALLY. THAT'S SKILLED ENDLESSLY COULD WHEN FULLY DEPLOYED- ISSUES SHE EMISSIONS FROM THE REGION BY FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS A YEAR. THE PROJECT ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE RECORDS OF THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY THAT ALREADY COMMITTED. TO USING HYDROGEN AS THE DECARBONISING. BUT TO UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO DECARBONISING THEIR IN BASIN. OF POWER GENERATION FACILITIES CURRENTLY TODAY ARE BY NATURAL GAS WITH HYDROGEN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO. REALLY CLEAN THE AIR AND REDUCE GHGS BY DEPLOYING HYDROGEN THEN YOU ADD IN THE WHOLE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO DECARBONISE HEAVY INDUSTRY AND HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION ESPCIALLY TRANSPORTATION GOING IN AND OUT OF THE AFFORDABILITY. IS THE THIS IS TERRY MENTIONED. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REDUCE THE USE OF DIESEL FUEL IN THE HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM DISPLACE AS MUCH AS THREE MILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL A DAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING KNOCKS TO THE TUNE OF. TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND. TONS PER ANNUM OF KNOX NOTHING HE THE SITUATION OF THE FORMS FONG. IN A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN THE L. A. BASIN AS WE ALL KNOW. THE PROJECT OF THIS SCALE AGAIN A LARGE GREEN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. BOTH PROJECT IS THE CAPACITY TO DISPLAYS. OF UP STATIONARY SOURCE BUT THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY ENDED MIRRORS MANY OF THE FINDINGS THAT- JANET NGUYEN MENTIONED BEFORE IT CAME OUT OF HIGH DEAL IS THE NATION'S LARGEST MANUFACTURING CENTER OF COURSE WE'RE FAMOUS FOR HOLLYWOOD. IT WAS FOR MOVIES AND SUNSHINE BUT WE ARE ALSO THE INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING CENTER FOR MUCH OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WE ALSO WILL THE TWO LARGEST PORTS IN THE NATION. ALL OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING THE POWER PLANTS REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DECARBONISE. USING GREEN HYDROGEN. INTERVIEW DECARBONIZE ITS FILL WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF HIGH BLOOD. I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT WE SEE ENDS WITH LINKED IN MANY OF THE PARTNERS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM ON ON THE PHONE THE NEW HEARING. IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT PARTNERS IN PURSUING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS HAD BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. WE SEE ENDLESS LINK IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME TOGETHER WITH OTHER PARTNERS IN SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO PURSUE THE I. A. J. FUNDS SPECIFICALLY FOR HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN HUBS BUT ALSO THE BROADER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AROUND HYDROGEN THREE HYDROGEN IN RESEARCH. AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO- YOUR ONGOING EFFORTS SENATOR GILLETTE UP. THE TO FIND THE ROLE FEDERATION IN CALIFORNIA AND- AGAIN I APPRECIATE I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTION. WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE TWO REMAINING SPEAKERS. LAWRENCE GUYVER IN AT THERESA COOK SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET LAURENCE GARBER ON THE LINE SHE IS THE CEO AND GENERAL MANAGER OF SUNLINE TRANSIT. AGENCY MRS GUYVER ARE YOU ONE. I'M FINE THANK YOU CENTER ARGUE LET I'M GOING TO GET NOW THAT NEIL STOP SHARING I WILL GET MINE UP AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY WE'RE GONNA SHIFT GEARS A LITTLE BIT. YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY SMALL OPERATOR IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES EAST OF LA IS ON THE CALL TODAY WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY REMINISCED ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND REYES PRESENTATION IS NOT MOVING IS IT MOVING FOR YOU GUYS BECAUSE IT'S NOT MOVING FOR ME- WE SEE A PICTURE AND THAT'S YEAH ENABLE BY. UP THERE WE GO CAN YOU SEE IT CHANGING NOW YEAH. SO THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY A SOMEONE HAS A LONG HISTORY IN ZERO MISSION WE WERE THE FIRST TO TRANSITION TO CNG WE'VE BEEN USING GASEOUS FUEL SINCE THAT TIME THE FIRST TO- OPERATE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES IN THE FIRST TO OPERATE DISPENSED AND GENERATE HYDROGEN FOR TRANSPORTATION. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FREE RUN TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY ONE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC BUSES- ON THE PROPERTY WE HAVE FIVE IN PRODUCTION WE ALSO ARE TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC SO WE DO RUN BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES INVOLVED HEAVY DUTY BUS AND IN OUR ON. A SUPPORT FLEET AND WE JUST GOT ALERTED THAT WE WANT TO EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BUS AND BUS FACILITIES GRANT FROM THE FDA FOR MORE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND- THE REHAB OF SOME OF OUR CNG VEHICLES TO GET US THROUGH. THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION. SO WHY ARE WE GOING TO FUEL CELL- WE'RE GOING FUEL CELL BASED ON A LOT OF THINGS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THE REPLACEMENT VEHICLES- CNG BUSES REPLACEMENT OF FUEL CELLS A ONE TO ONE REPLACEMENT. WE DO RUN BATTERY ELECTRIC AS I MENTIONED AND THE REPLACEMENT FOR THOSE VEHICLES TO KEEP THE SAME ROUTE PROFILE WE DO TODAY WOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO BUSES. FOR EVERY CNG BUS WE OPERATE TODAY WE ALSO HAVE A CHALLENGING CLIMENT INTO POVERTY OUT HERE IN THE DESERT AND FIND IF YOU'LL SO RELIABILITY. IS EXCELLENT AND THEN IT ALSO MEETS THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS WE DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE FUELING CLEANING AND PUTTING TO BED OF OUR VEHICLES AT NIGHT WHEN WE TRANSITION FROM COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS TO HYDROGEN. YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT WE HAVE A FEW VERY SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS- SO WHAT WE BRING TO THE TABLE FOR CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HUB IS ALREADY PRODUCTION FOR HYDROGEN USED IN THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE. WE DO OUT ELECTROLYZER RIGHT NOW THAT'S FOR YOU SEE NINE HUNDRED KILOGRAMS FOR DAY. IT IS A SCALABLE UNIT SO WE ALWAYS PLAN ON SCALING IT UP FOR PRODUCTION TO OFF TAKERS. WE'RE ALSO DOING A PROJECT WITH NEIL AND HIS TEAM AT SO CAL GAS THEY EACH TWO SILVER STARS. WHICH WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT BASED ON THE SCALABILITY THE SIZE AND THE COST OF HYDROGEN. AND WE WERE ALSO AWARDED A CDC GRANT TO BUILD AID LIQUID STATION FOR RESILIENCY FOR BOTH OUR FLEET. AND FOR THE COACHELLA VALLEY FOR THEIR NEEDS FOR HYDROGEN WHETHER IT BE FOR VEHICLE USE OR ELECTRICITY. WE JUST PILOTED A NEW TRAILER BY NICE AMERICA- THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IN THE STARTER SET FOR HYDROGEN FOR FLEET OPERATORS. SOMEONE IS NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN HELPING TRANSIT BUT ALSO FLEET OPERATORS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION IN HYDROGEN AS A CHOICE. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A SMALL SCALE TRAILER THAT CAN BE MOVED- IT CAN FUEL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BAR WHICH HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND TRANSIT USE BUT IT CAN ALSO AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING A PUMP FOR NINE HUNDRED- I'M SORRY SEVEN HUNDRED BAR AND SO IT COULD BE A DUAL STATION. ON WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THIS PROVIDES TO THEM THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY FOR BOTH EASE OF USE AND FOR SCALABILITY. AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY SUNLINE IS LOOKING TO PROCURE WANTED THESE ARE UNITS TO PUT OUR INTO YOUR FACILITY SO WE CAN MAKE HYDROGEN AVAILABLE TO THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY. AND THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF THE EASTERN REGION. WE HAVE SOME FUTURE PLANS I SAY WE RENT REMINISCED ABOUT THE FUTURE HERE IT'S ONLINE- WE HAVE WITH THE PROJECTS THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU. WE WILL HAVE THREE TIMES FOR HYDROGEN AVAILABLE PER DAY I'M RIGHT NOW OUR FLEET DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT. AMOUNT SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SELL HYDROGEN WE'VE BEEN SELLING CNG FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND USE THAT REVENUE TO PUT BACK INTO SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO LOOKING FOR WAYS TO CREATE RESILIENCY WELL THAT ARE FUNDING STREAMS AND ONE AT TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND OUR TRANSIT COMPONENT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. I WE ALL ARE ALSO LOOKING TO MAKE OUR HYDROGEN COMPLETELY RENEWABLE THROUGH A SOLAR MICROGRID. I'M WE HAVE A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT'S KIND OF CHEATED THERE IN THE AREA THAT WE ONLY NOW. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IN TALKS RIGHT NOW TO BUY A PARCEL RIGHT ADJACENT TO OURS. FIRST THAT WILL BE SOLAR PRODUCTION SO WE CAN. CREATE OUR HYDROGEN USING COMPLETELY GREEN ALL METHODS. AND THEN WE LOOK TO BUILD A TRUCK PLAZA ON THAT- PIECE OF LAND. ON THIS WOULD BE FOR THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR TO USE- FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FUEL IT. YOU'LL AS THEY GET INTO THE LA BASIN AND CONGESTION LA. AND ALSO AS THEY LA BASIN AND POINTS EAST ON THE I. TEN CORRIDOR- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE'RE GOING TO USE. WITH THE ALREADY BE- THE ATTRIBUTES WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US SO THEY'RE ALREADY INTERCHANGES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ON THE I. TEN CORRIDOR. THAT WOULD MAKE EASE OF USE FOR THIS STATION FOR TRUCKS MOVING DOWN. THE I. TEN CORRIDOR IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AVAILABLE EASY AND QUICK. I ALSO WANT TO SHOW YOU WHERE SUNLINE IS IN RELATION TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS AND ARE SOME OF MY SPEAKER PARTNERS- WE ARE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES FROM LA AND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM THE PORT OF. LOS ANGELES MAKING US A KEY STOPPING POINT FOR FREIGHT MOVING ITS WAY TO THE EAST OR COMING INTO THE PORT WITH THOSE OPPORTUNITY FEELS AS I MENTIONED. THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND WE TALKED ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SUNLINE IS ALSO BUILDING A WEST COAST OF X. IT IS COMPLETELY- DEDICATED TO THE WORK TRANSITION OF WORKFORCE IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY RENEWABLE ENERGY- WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THIS. ON OUR FACILITY I MEAN THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SCHEDULE SUNLINE WON A GRANT FROM THE FTA FOR THIS FACILITY AS WELL AND HAS PUT SOME OF ITS OWN MONEY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR TRANSITIONING. THE WORKFORCE THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING COMBUSTION ENGINE OR FOSSIL FUEL. TECHNOLOGIES INTO ZERO MISSION NOW WE CAN BE NOT ONLY TRANSFER THOSE SKILLS TO. THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE BUT ALSO INCENTIVIZE NEW STUDENTS. IN LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THESE. EXCITING TECHNOLOGIES. I'M THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THE STREET SCHOOL RIGHT ON OUR PROPERTY GIVES YOU A LITTLE AERIAL. VIEW LOOK THERE TO THE RIGHT OF WERE REPLIED THIS OP STILL BEING BURNT BUILT THAT IS OUR CURRENT STATION. AT SOME POINT WE PLAN FOR THAT TO BE A LIGHT DUTY STATION FOR HYDROGEN. ARE WE WILL SELL CNG THERE AS WELL AS WE TRANSITION OVER- BUT THAT GIVES US BOTH THE LIGHT DUTY STATION AND. A HEAVY DUTY STATION FOR THE FUTURE. WE HAVE AN INVITE. BOARD OVER OUR SCHOOL IT'S THE MAJOR MANUFACTURERS WERE BUILDING HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL BUSES AND COMPONENTS. THEY GUIDE THE TRAINING AND THE DIRECTION OF THE OF THE WEST COAST CENTER OF EXCELLENCE. AND THEY'VE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL IN US GETTING THIS TRAINING READY FOR THE WORKFORCE. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MODULES THAT ARE ALREADY READY TO TRAIN- AND THEY'RE INCLUDE NOT ONLY PREPARING A TECHNICIAN TO OPERATE ON THESE KINDS OF VEHICLES BUT ALSO AN ORGANIZATION FOR GETTING READY FOR ZERO MISSION DEPLOYMENT. AND CREATING A LEADERSHIP AND FOCUS WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE SURE THESE DEPLOYMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. WE KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR AN ENTIRE ORGANIZATION WHETHER IT'S A PRIVATE FLEET PROVIDER OR TRANSIT AGENCY. TO UNDERSTAND THIS TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A VISION SO THAT SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENTS TAKE PLACE. AND WITH THAT I WILL YIELD MY TIME SENATORS LETTER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE HAVE QUITE A FEW CITIES. THAT ARE LOOKING IN THAT ARE- HOPING TO FOLLOW SUIT. WHAT A GREAT LEADER YOU ARE. IN YOUR- IN YOUR CITY. OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND- BRING UP OUR LAST AND NOT LEAST- TO RESTRICT CUCKOOS A GONNA CLOSES OUT WITH OUR SPEAKERS. TO RESTRICT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AT THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION- THIS IS GOOD THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR HI GOOD AFTERNOON- MEMBERS TO READ THE COOKING SECOND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION AND- WHEN I JUST REALLY I. FOR US THE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE- APPRECIATION FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THAT- YOU KNOW WELL TIME VERY IMPORTANT. I AM VERY EXCITED TO DISCUSS WAYS BE COMMITTEE TODAY HOW HYDROGEN MOBILITY IT INTO THE TOP OPPORTUNITY. AND THE GOAL FROM THE HEALTH PROTECTION COALITION- CLUB IS NOT JUSTICE- INVESTMENT IN HYDROGEN BUT TO BUILD A RESILIENT HEALTH EFFICIENT AND CLIMATE CONSCIOUS. HYDROGEN ECONOMY THAT NOT JUST THEIR ENERGY BUT TRANSPORTATION AS WELL I'M ALL OF THE SPEAKERS THAT WENT BEFORE ME I'D DEFINITELY INCLUDED TRANSPORTATION IS A BIG PART OF THEIR PROJECT RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOR THAT YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATED WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT. THAT ELEMENT PLAYING A ROLE IN A CALIFORNIA HUB AS OPPOSED TO HAVING JUST ON THIS EXCLUSIVELY ENERGY OR ONE THAT'S EXCLUSIVELY TRANSPORTATION LET'S JUST I'LL BRING IT IN UNDER. THE UMBRELLA IS ONE. I STARTING OFF WITH YOU KNOW OUR OUR- I JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THIS. CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN. IN OF A THERMOS BE A FROM WITH. LIKE OUR DANCE THE PLATE REGULATION. JUST A REMINDER OF YOU KNOW THE REGULAR ARE GONNA BEGIN TO TAKE IT BACK TO TWENTY FIVE FOUR SO EACH THE QUICKLY- OUR ENEMY. CLEAN TRANSIT REGULATION COULDN'T FROM HER MORE ABOUT LAWRENCE HOWEVER YOU KNOW BEING A ROCKSTAR I'D AM SURE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND ENTERED YOUR MACHINE PEOPLE REGULATION ARE PASSENGER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD- AND WITH SUPPORTING POLICIES LIKE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE GREEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF- CHARGING AND HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT SO TO A POINT MADE EARLIER BY TERRY CANNON AND THEN OTHERS GIVEN THE INVESTMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS IN A REGULATORY AND POLICY FRAMEWORK AROUND YOUR MACHINE VEHICLES WE DEFINITELY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A CORNERSTONE FOR CALIFORNIA UP. WHAT I OPERATE SECOND RECOMMENDATION THAT WE LEVERAGE THIS FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS- THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN HYDROGEN TO CREATE A SELF SUSTAINING HYDROGEN ECONOMY. I'M THE TYPE AND IN YOUR ADDRESS MANY EARLIER HE NOTED THAT PUBLIC POLICY SUPPORT THAT SORT OF LAUNCH OF HYDROGEN BY PRIVATE ACTORS WHAT IS GOING TO SCALE BACK AND- THAT WAS JUST A ROBUST YOU KNOW AGREEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA HAD DURING COALITION FOR THAT. POINT YOU KNOW BETTER UNDERSCORED BY THE FACT THAT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD FINDS THAT 90% OF THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK COSTS ARE GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND SO IF WE CAN ENCOURAGE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO FINISH THE LAUNCH OF THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK THAT'LL PLAY VERY NICELY INTO THE TUB PROJECT THAT WE'RE HOPING TO BRING TO CALIFORNIA- AND MANY OF YOU KNOW- WAY THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH THE BUILD OUT AT THE LIGHT. AND MEDIUM DUTY HYDROGEN FUELING THAT WORK THROUGHOUT THE OF. THAT WOULD RESULT IN ONE. HYDROGEN STATION HELLO OKAY AT A- CAFES. FIGHTING NINE SEVEN PER FUEL COVERAGE DISAPPEAR COMMUNITIES AND 94% OF THE- STATE. WE WOULD ALL RECOMMEND THE STATE- LAUNCHED THE HEAVY DUTY FUELING NETWORK- AND YOU KNOW AGAIN JUST IN TIME FOR OUR ADVANCE CLEAN FLEETS REGULATION- SO WE ARE URGING THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AB TWO HUNDRED HEAVY DUTY FUELING STATION. THANKS TWO HUNDRED STATIONS WOULD PROVIDE SEVENTY THOUSAND- FUELING SUPPORT FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND TRACKS THAT WERE ABLE TO DO QUITE A BIT- WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE. I'M INVESTMENT HERE- DRIVE COST REDUCTIONS IN VEHICLE STATION EQUPMENT AND YOU ALSO FEEL KIND OF OUR ALIGNMENT THAT JANET PLAN MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS REALLY A NO REGRETS STRATEGY I YOU KNOW AND HYDROGEN MOBILITY THAT WE ARE SPEAKING. AND I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT IT'S A MONTHS BEFORE WE GET INTO RAIL AVIATION AND MARINE EITHER AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONSUMING AN AWFUL LOT OF HYDROGEN. USING AN AWFUL LOT OF EQUIPMENT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN BE IN THESE INVESTMENTS NOW WE ARE BETTER ABLE TO. PROVIDE IMPORTANT COST REDUCTION IN A QUICK MANNER GOING INFRASTRUCTURE AND- FUEL CELLS THEMSELVES. I BEFORE MOVING ON HIGHEST ONE OFFERED THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THAT FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE COME FIRST AS WE HAVE FOUND IN THE LATE TO THE MARKET. CUSTOMERS IN PHILADELPHIA AND ATHLETE OPERATORS ARE NOT GOING TO TRANSITION YOU FEEL HEALTHIER COLDER HERE EMISSION VEHICLE ALTERNATIVE. IF THE FUELING IS UNAVAILABLE THAT IS- TROOPER HYDROGEN JUST LIKE IT IS FOR CHARGING. AND I WOULD OFFER THAT THE SIMULTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT OF FUEL DEALING INFRASTRUCTURE AND VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT IN SOME WAYS KIND OF CONSTRAINED THE MARKET AGAIN REALLY URGING WE LEAD WITH AN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST- POLICY ZERO HIGH. BUT IN THE NEAR TERM THINK WE HAVE TO REAL. ABOUT PER IN. SUPPLY OF HIGH THAT IS ALSO AFFORDABLE YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY JUNCTURE LET'S NOT PRECLUDE OTHER PRODUCTION PATHWAY THE LET'S BUILD TOWARD WHAT WE WANT IN THE FUTURE. DIGGING A BIT DEEPER ON PRODUCTION STARTING WITH ELECTROLYTIC- YOU KNOW I WON'T REPEAT THAT GOOD WORK THAT THE SPEAKERS I HAD OFFERED. BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE IS SOME POLICY WORK THAT IS NEEDED BY THE LEGISLATURE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND TIGHT SO. AROUND THE INDUSTRIAL RATE FOR- RENEWABLE POWER WHICH IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT ELECTROLYTES HERS AND TO MAKE THAT A COST COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY. SO AGAIN RECOMMENDING SOME POLICY WORKAROUNDS CREATING WHOLESALE RATE FOR ACCESS RENEWABLE POWER SO THAT WE CAN MAKE ELECTROLYZER ELECTROLYTES OR SUCH FOR COST COMPETITIVE. I'M USING BIO MATHS MAKE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN- THAT WAS DISCUSSED BY SPEAKERS- BEFORE ME I JUST WANT TO OFFER THAT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE IN ITS GETTING TO NEUTRAL REPORT. IDENTIFIED THESE ORGANIC WASTE PRODUCTS THESE- BIOMASS PRODUCTS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE THAT IS AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE METHANE EMITTING PRODUCTS FOR RENEWABLE HYDOGEN PRODUCTION AND SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT. THE ROLE THAT THAT PATHWAY WILL PLAY NOT ONLY IN PROVIDING. RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FUEL BUT ALSO IMPORTANT CO BENEFITS. LIKE METHANE REDUCTION THE- KNOW WORK COULD BE- Q. KIND OF LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL HAVE OPPORTUNITY RELATED TO THE PER. I HAVE A HIGH FUELING STATIONS HYDROGEN PRODUCTION PROJECT ETCETERA- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD. TIME IN CALIFORNIA OR WHAT ARE KNOWN AS LEADERSHIP PROJECT I EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED PROJECTS AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE BUILD OUT OF WHATEVER HYDROGEN HUB. IS A GOOD CANDIDATE TO QUALIFY FROM SOME OF THOSE REQUESTS STREAMLINING- I. AND THEN ALSO- MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON FUEL DISTRIBUTION VIA PIPELINE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT JANET NGUYEN MENTIONED AND HER COMMENT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSED- AND BEFORE I FINISH OFF I JUST WANNA YOU KNOW OFFERED THAT. A COMPREHENSIVE HAVE BEEN CALIFORNIA THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY WOULD BE INCREDIBLY TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE STATE. IT'S A SINGULAR OPPORTUNITY TO SCALE INDUSTRY IF WE LEAVE WITH THE SAME ABILITY HEALTH EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY AND MINES- AND TO THAT END WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE REST OF OUR YOU KNOW HYDROGEN FAMILY MEMBERS I'M TO MAKE THE MOST IT'S REALLY. TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU MRS COOK- I COULD SEE YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDERS. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE ALL COME TOGETHER- TO WORK AS ONE. FOR THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEAD THE NATION IN HARJIT AND HYDROGEN. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE- SO THANK YOU ALL PANELISTS FOR STANDING BY IN STAYING WITH US BECAUSE WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. AS WE BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS. SO WHAT THANK YOU THE PRINT THE PRESENTERS ONCE AGAIN WE WILL BRING HIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS. FOR THE PANELISTS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC. I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ONCE AGAIN THE PUBLIC. TO PREPARE FOR THEIR PURPOSE A PARTICIPATION. BY DIALING THE TOLL FREE NUMBER. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. TWO TWO SIX EIGHT ONE SIX THREE. WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE. SEVEN THREE SIX TWO EIGHT THREE THREE. WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION- TO OUR MEMBERS AND AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE SENATOR JOSH NEWMAN AND SENATOR BEN ALLEN WITH ME TODAY SO I WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR. JOSH NEWMAN IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS TO ANY ONE OF OUR PANELISTS. EDITOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. TO ALL OF THE PANELISTS THIS MORNING I THINK- MISS COOK. SUMMED IT UP WELL AT THE END BY REFERRING TO OUR HYDROGEN FAMILY- AND SO BUT DID YOU KNOW IT IS EXCITING- THIS MOMENT WHERE WE ARE ON THE CUSP. OF USE REAL BREAKTHROUGHS- IT'S REAL BENEFITS AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE PLAY IT'S- ROBERT ROWLAND EXPEDITING AND SUPPORTING. THIS TRANSITION. I'VE BEEN VERY INVOLVED AS MANY FOLKS KNOW IN IN THE ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE IN THE EFFORT TO BUILD OUT. THAT CALIFORNIA'S LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN FUELING INSTALLATIONS- AND IT IT. I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PANELISTS AND IT SEEMS THAT AS- YOU KNOW WE START LOOKING AT. THESE LARGER OPPORTUNITIES OR SEEM TO A TENSION HAS GROWN UP BETWEEN LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY PARTICULAR RESPECT TO- YOU KNOW SIR. ALLOCATIONS OF THE F. IS GOING TO POSITION DIFFERENT. RESIDENTS IN THE INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT FOR ALLOCATIONS AGAINST EITHER SAVE MONEY TO THE FEDERAL GRANTS CHAU TO IT LOVE TO HEAR FROM- I GUESS STARTING WITH MISS COOK- MY OWN TAKE IS THAT THERE'S A SYNERGISTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY- BUT BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE. AS IT RELATES TO BOTH OF THESE PLATFORMS. I REQUEST THANK YOU SENATOR I'M- IN THIS IN THE EARLY ADOPTION PHASE. THERE WILL BE WHILE LEVELS OF MANKIND AND EACH THE VEHICLE CLOCK THERE I'M L. EIGHT AND WE WORK TOWARDS SCALING UP THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY IN TOTAL WE NEED TO DEMAND CREATED BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE MEDIUMS. EVERYTHING ONE OF THOSE PASSENGER VEHICLE IN ORDER TO ALLOW HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCERS YOU MAKE LARGE INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE I'M PRODUCTION PATHWAYS AT AN AFFORDABLE COST THAT BENEFITS EVERYBODY SO WE EITHER GROW TOGETHER OR WE FALL APART AND YOU KNOW I BELIEVE AND THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW FIRST ANSWER WOULD OFFER AND THEN THE SECOND. IS THAT I'D- THERE ARE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE ON THE ROAD AND ABOUT ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY YOUR CALL AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT WITH A ROBOT. WITH ROBUST SUPPORT FOR PASSENGER VEHICLE AND- LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER VEHICLES FOR TO SCALE IN PRODUCING THOSE HEALTH AFTER THOSE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE IS TRANSFERABLE TO THE HEAVY DUTY APPLICATIONS SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO IN LIFE YOU NEED FOR OUR COST REDUCTION IN THE- COMPONENT PARTS OF THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCK. CONVERSELY YOU KNOW BLACK LIGHT DUTY CAN BE A CALL ABOUT FIVE KILOGRAMS WHEREAS EIGHT TRACK HAD FIFTY KILOGRAM SO B. THE MAN'S PROFILE AND THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND HOW MUCH FUEL IS GOING TO CONSUME. IS GOING TO CREATE THAT SORT OF DEMAND IN THE MARKET AND ENTERPRISES PRODUCERS TO COMMENT WHICH DRIVE DOWN THE COSTS NOT JUST FOR THE HEAVY DUTY COMMUNITY THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE MAJOR COST REDUCTIONS FOR. THE PASSENGER VEHICLE FLEET THERE'S A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS WITH DEVELOPING- WHEN WE WANT TO REDUCE FUEL COSTS AND REDUCE COMPONENT PARTS THAT GO INTO VEHICLES. WHICH AND WE ALL KNOW IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO ADOPTION AND THE HEAVY DUTY. SECTOR WE'VE GOT A DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE YOUR MISSION TRUCKS- IN EVERY. WAY THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT FROM ANY OTHER PANELS SUSPICIOUS SOMEBODY HAS A- THAT A- VIEW OF THIS. ANYONE IN THEIR PANELS LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. THANK YOU- I JUST WANTED TO BUILD ON WHAT THERESA SAID IN HER EARLIER COMMENTS THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK. ABOUT ADVANCING TRANSPORTATION ALONGSIDE OTHER APPLICATIONS- SHE MENTIONED IT WAS FIVE KILOGRAMS FOR A PASSENGER CAR. FIFTY KILOGRAMS- TRUCK HEAVY DUTY TRUCK AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE TRUCKS ARE REALLY BIG SOURCES OF POLLUTION CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. THE CHALLENGES AT THE END AND WE DID EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH A LOT OF OFF TAKERS- THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND HIGH DEAL LA. WE KNOW THAT THESE FLEET OPERATORS JAHN'S ARE- IN TERMINAL OPERATORS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST MOBILE HEAVY DUTY AT STATIONARY. ANY AS WELL THEY WANT TO CONVERT THEY WANT TO DECARBONISE AND WHAT WE HEARD THEM SAY IS THAT THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM. IT WASN'T I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY IT'S THE COST OF THE TRUCK OR THE COST OF THE NEW FUEL CELL PLATFORM. BUT WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THEY SAID NO IT'S THAT'S NOT IT. THE NUMBER ONE CHALLENGE IS THE COST OF THE FUEL. IT'S NOT ONLY THE COST OF THE FUEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO LIKE BY ENOUGH OF IT. SO IT'S ACCESS AND IT'S COST BECAUSE THOSE USERS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP MAKES SENSE FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT. SO ON THAT'S WHY IN THINKING ABOUT ADVANCING R. HOBBS- WE RECOMMEND THAT WE START WITH THE LARGE. BANKABLE OFF TAKERS YOU NEED JUST A COUPLE. HAVE INSTABILITY IN PLANNING FOR. A HIGH VOLUME COMPETITIVE. REDUCTION MARKET AND THEREFORE YOU GETS MUCH EASIER ONCE YOUR VISIBILITY INTO ONE LARGE DROPPED ANCHOR IN A IN A IN A LARGER SUPPLY CONTRACT TO ADAM AND OTHERS. AND IT WAS OUR CONCLUSION- AFTER DOING ALL THESE INTERVIEWS THAT THE STATIONARY AND MOBILE DIESEL USERS WILL CONVERT MUCH MORE QUICKLY ONCE THEY HAVE VISIBILITY INTO THOSE CONTRACTS SO IN SOME WAYS IT FROM OUR CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY. STARTING WITH SOME OF THE LARGER OFF TAKERS CONTRACTING WITH THEM ADDING OTHERS WE CAN TAKING ONE BIG LEAP FORWARD TO PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TO LOWER DELIVERY COSTS AND WHEN YOU CAN GET THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL THAT'S HEADS. AND NOT TIED. TO ANY WARS IN UKRAINE OR- YOU KNOW IT'S MADE LOCALLY- THAT'S A REALLY ATTRACTIVE VALUE PROPOSITION I THINK HISTORY WILL JUST TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN SO IN IN A SIMILAR AND THERE SEEMS TO BE. TENSION WITH RESPECT TO COLORS OF HYDROGEN RIGHT SHOULD YOU KNOW THE GREEN NESS I THINK EVERYBODY BUT- THERE'S NOBODY HERE DOESN'T BELIEVE AT LEAST ASPIRATIONAL AND GETTING TO FULLY RECHARGING BUT BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE. A CONVERSATION GOING ON ABOUT WHAT OUR TOLERANCE SHOULD BE WATER APPROACH SHOULD BE OVER TIME- AS AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW THAT A WILLINGNESS TO MOVE THROUGH. A PHASE WHERE WE ACCEPT AS A GIVEN AGAIN I THANK- THAT YOU CAN'T BE GREEN STARRED IN FACT THERE'S A SORT OF AN INNOVATION PATHWAY THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE. SO HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT DELIBERATELY AS AS IT RELATES TO- YOU KNOW ALLOCATIONS AND PRIORITIES AND POLICIES. MISATTRIBUTED ME I AM. VERY DO I WHICH NOT CLEAR TO THEM I'M JUST ASKING THE PANEL- GOOD IDEAS FROM ANYBODY. I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT JUST BRIEFLY THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO GREEN HOLDING US BACK- AND WE HAVE SEEN LARGE HURDLE. RATE AROUND THE WORLD IN FACT I THINK THE PROJECT LAUREN THAT YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE WORKING ON WITH SO CAL GAS IS ALREADY. PRODUCING AT THREE DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM WHICH IS VERY EXCITING. BOB IT'S TERRY TERMINATE YOUR CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME YES YOU'RE READING IT. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BACKGROUND NOISE COINCIDENTLY HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER MEETING SO I'M IN A FUEL CELL- HONDA AT THE MOMENT DRIVING TO MY NEXT MEETING AND- OF REALLY ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION. UP YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE PRODUCE SOMETHING OVER THREE TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR I'LL FROM MOSTLY NATURAL GAS STEAM REFORMATION OF NATURAL GAS A FOSSIL FUELS WHAT WE DO THAT HYDROGEN UP. TO VOTE. MOSTLY IS USED FOR STRIPPING SULFUR FROM PETROLEUM TO MAKE DIESEL AND GASOLINE INSTEAD OF SIMPLY PUTTING IT INTO OUR VEHICLES. SO THE TRUTH IS IF WE SIMPLY PUT IT INTO OUR VEHICLES WE CUT OUT ALL OF THE NEEDS OF THE OIL. AND ALL OF THE POLLUTION AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH IT EVEN IF WE WERE STILL USING A FOSSIL FUEL I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THAT SECRETARY. BUT BUT I HI I POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE I THINK. THAT THE- BIOGAS BIOMETHANE HAS TRAFFIC POTENTIAL. AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO MEASURE THE CARBON INTENSITY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE CARBON INTENSITY DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE GETTING THE WATER LET'S SAY YOU ARE DOING ELECTROLYSIS WITH THE- SOLAR OR WIND POWER. BUT DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM AND WHERE THE WATER IS COMING FROM THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE HYDROGEN FROM. THAT COULD HAVE A MUCH HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY THAT IF YOU'RE TAKING. LET'S SAY LANDFILL GAS WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING FLARED OR OR EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. TWENTY SIX TIMES MORE POTENT AS A HEAT TRAPPING GAS. THANCO TWO. AND AND SO THE CARBON INTENSITY SCORES REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING. VERY THE PRESSURE THAT'S ON THE LAST QUESTION AND- THAT'LL BE TURNED BACK OVER MY CULTURE. AND BUNCH OF FOLKS IN THEIR TESTIMONY DAY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVERAGING- PUBLIC INVESTMENTS TO. INSTIGATE AN EXPEDITED PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO THAT BY SWITCHING STUFF GOING ON AMONG UTILITIES- ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE PIPELINES OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE USEFUL HYDROGEN. I DO I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR- THE- SOCALGAS ROASTED IN THE IN DEATH AS SORT OF BIG EXEMPLIFYING THESE. QUESTIONS YOU TALK ABOUT THE ANGELES LINK PROJECT THAT THEY CAN AND YOU KNOW THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES IF IT'S A PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS THIS GOING TO BE BORNE BY SHAREHOLDERS OR BY RATE PAYERS- AS AS WE MOVE THESE THINGS FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN FROM EURO AT THE MOMENT ARE ANGELES LANG. EFFORT IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO SCOPE THE PROJECT AND LOOK AT THE OFF TAKERS AND SUPPLIERS AND- CHARACTERIZE THE MARKET BY LET'S SAY. EARLY ENGINEERING EFFORTS I WILL SAYTHAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY UN IDEAL AWAY WITH JANICE AND HER TEAM AND MANY OTHERS. WE KNOW THE MARKET EXIST TODAY- BUT OUR EARLY EFFORT IS REALLY TO CHARACTERIZE. WHAT PART OF OUR OWN. HEAVY INDUSTRIAL TRANSPORTATION. INDISPENSABLE FUEL- COSTUMERS THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT EXIST OR ALREADY HAVE EXISTING NATURAL GAS WITH. WHAT CUSTOMERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM HYDROGEN. AND ONCE WE'VE DONE THAT ONCE WE JUST DON'T FOR MARKET THEN I THINK YOU KNOW IT BE TIME TO START WITH THE HOSPITALIZATION WORLD LEADERS OF THE COST OF THAT WE DO THINK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC GOOD. IN THE UTILITIES OF PROVIDING A BROAD ACCESS TO HYDROGEN- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY BEING UNDERTAKEN IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE. AT HALF PACE. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE AT LEAST IN SOME PART. AS AAS A RESULT OF THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE- THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS DOUBLED DOWN ON ITS EFFORTS TO BECOME INDEPENDENT OR FROM RUSSIA. IN TWO WAYS ONE BY ACCELERATING. THE ACCESS TO AMERICAN LIQUID OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS CONVERSATION. BUT REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY MAKING COMMITMENTS GREEN HYDROGEN AND THAT GREEN HYDROGEN IT WILL LARGELY BE- MOVED THROUGHOUT EUROPE IN THE- LARGE SCALE TRANSMISSION. HE IS- OPERATORS THOSE ADDITIONAL UTILITY TYPE OPERATORS THAT MOVE GAS ON BEHALF OF COST SO WE SEE A THE CUSTOMER CLASS IT WILL BE. DISTINCTLY BENEFIT SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY IN ELDERLY I THINK IT'LL BE A CONVERSATION LEGISLATORS AND- AND REGULATORS AS THE HOMES. I APPRECIATE DAVIS YOU HAVE DONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SENATOR BEN ALLEN YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS. WELL I JUST APPRECIATE ALL THESE GREAT PRESENTATIONS I'VE EVER OF CERTAINLY LEARNED A LOT AND- IT DID YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A THERE'S SO MUCH WORK UNDER WAY I GUESS- I WOULD LOVE SOME INSIGHTS. MAYBE FROM KOBE IS- AS WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR- APPLICATION AND WE GOT YOU KNOW HOW PROPOSALS FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTH VERY WORTHY HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT THE GEOGRAPHIC BALANCE- AS WE AS WE APPROACH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN OUR APPLICATIONS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER ALLEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE FOCUSING ON THESE COMING MONTHS WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO SEE OTHER R. F. P. THE FELLOW WHAT SHAPE THAT TAKES. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT YOU KNOW IS A LOT OF GEOGRAPHIC STRENGTHENED WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THERE'S A LOT OFWORK IN LOS ANGELES THAT UNIT GREAT IDEA OF THE PROJECT AND IN LODI. AND SO I THINK THE WAY I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT IS- FIRST WE HAVE TO FIGURE HOW MUCH MONEY THERE IS AND THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF FACING RIGHT SO LIKE WHERE IS THAT FIRST INVESTMENTS YEAH WE DO ALL OF IT AT ONCE IS IT MAKES SENSE TO INVEST IN ONE REGION FIRST. AND THEN PHASE AND THE SECOND REGION'S THOSE THESE ARE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS WE DON'T DILUTES THE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND STATE RESOURCES SUCH A WAIVER ULTIMATELY. NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT I BUT THE IMPORTANT PART IS MAKING SURE THAT ULTIMATE PAN IS BRINGING THIS STATEWIDE SO FOR WORK WHERE IT STARTS AND FINISHES YOU KNOW YOU COULD SEE IT SO. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES BUT I MEAN I COULD SEE A CASE WHERE WE'RE DOING A BUNCH OF PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE ONCE THERE'S ALSO POTENTIAL TO START IN A REGION WITH A CLEAR PLAN TO EXPAND INTO OTHER REGIONS. SO I KNOW IT'S NOT A COMPLETE ANSWER AT THIS POINT BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING OURSELVES AND WANT TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE COME TO A CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND VISIT THIS AND AFTER THE STATE BUT ALSO THE NATIONAL MARKET TO SUCCEED. AND TYSON WHAT SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN- IN OTHER REGIONS RIGHT NOW NO I WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER REGIONS AS PRESENTED BY THE- THE FEDERAL FOLKS BUT- ARE THEY ARE. LOOKING TO DO MORE. STATE CO. ALL OR- YEAH YEAH. LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THAT WE ARE INSTANTLY IN. AN ADULT. AND MANY OTHERS HAVE I MEAN I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF ALL OF THEM. I THINK JUST LAST. YESTERDAY MAYBE NEW YORK ANNOUNCED THE CONSORTIUM IN THE NORTHEAST THEN THERE'S THAT THERE'S AN- INNATE. THE INTERMOUNTAIN. AND THERE'S LIKE THE TEXAS LOUISIANA POTENTIALLY NORTHWEST- AND I THINK. SO YES THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF- WE NEED TO GATHER RESOURCES I THINK EVERYBODY IN FROM WHAT I'VE GATHERED IN OVERLOOKING THE CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN. AND UNIQUE ENTITY BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK IF IT STRENGTHENS OUR APPLICATION BRINGING AND OTHER REGIONAL PARTNERS EITHER DIRECTLY WITHIN THE APPLICATION OR WE PLAN TO GET THERE KIND OF SIMILAR TO THINKING ABOUT THE REGION'S. HIS GRADES WERE ACTIVELY PURSUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WELL YOU KNOW WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF THE NORTHWEST- OF COURSE UNIT IN THE ATTIC THREE HUNDRED COLLISION PRESENTATION STUDY PORTENTS OF THE CONNECTION TO UTAH YOU KNOW SO. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE CONNECTED THIS. OFFICE RATHER. OR FRACKING OF LOS ALAMOS NINE. MONTH OKAY IT IS TAKES A LITTLE ASKEW ALSO ON WHERE WE'RE HOW DO YOU ANSWER I'VE- THE CONCERNS OUT THERE THAT- YOU KNOW. ELECTROLYSIS STIRRED DERIVE GREEN HYDROGEN IS GREAT AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A VISION THERE FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE USE OF ACCESS ELECTRICITY- USED TO DO THAT BUT- BUT THAT BUT THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY- OF REALLY A SHARP PIVOT TOWARD HYDROGEN. WILL MESSAGE WILL NECESSITATE A DOUBLING DOWN ON NATURAL GAS AND OTHER FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A LONG TIME TO GET TO THAT GREEN HYDROGEN VISION. THAT'S PROBLEMATIC WHERE WHERE WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU- YOU KNOW. EVALUATE THAT THAT TENSION. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION  THINK EVEN LOOKING AT GENESIS LIED ABOUT THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE COST OF HYDROGEN AND GREEN HEIDI ALTERNATELY GREEN HYDROGEN IS GOING TO OUTCOMPETE FOSSIL SOURCES AND SO FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVES YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WOULD LIKE TO PRIORITIZE INVESTING IN GREEN HYDROGEN ON THE BROAD DEFINITION I THINK YES THIS IS A REALLY GOD ONE. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW INDUSTRY CAN'T INVEST IN FOSSIL BASED PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL OR THEY WON'T IT'S ALL PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENABLE IS THE RENEWABLE GREEN HYDROGEN AND ULTIMATELY THE ECONOMICS AND ABOUT. THE REALLY CUTS BACK IN AND IT HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE PENETRATION IN ECONOMICS OF SOLAR AND WIND AS YOU CAN YEAH AFTER A LOT MORE CAPACITIES REFER ANY PREVIOUS VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF YOU KNOW- DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES. AND ALL THREE OF THOSE SECTORS. YEAH I'M IT WAS IS THE CONVERSATION LIKE BETWEEN GO BIZ AND THE AIR BOARD ON THESE. THE PHILOSOPHICAL. YES G. SOURCING CONVERSATION. VERY CLOSELY ALIGNED SO WE ARE REALLY LOOKING TO THE AIRPORT FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP LIKE THREE DYSTOPIAN PLAN YOU KNOW BASED ON THEIR FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS HOW DO WE GET TO WORK TWENTY FORTY FIVE ALITY CARTER AND THAT'S THE BASE AT THE TABLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ORGANIZE AROUND THAT IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW BIG OF A ROLE. I DO ANYTHING WILL PLAY REALLY FRANKLY AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT HYDROGEN IS POSITION TO PLAY ITS BEST ROLE AND EXPAND THEM PROBABLY ENOUGH REFORMS EVEN WATER PROJECTIONS ARE. SO IT WAS VERY CLOSE PARTNERSHIP AND ALIGNMENT YEAH. I'M OKAY I LOOK FOR IS ALL THANK YOU. FOR THE PRESENTATION I'M I'M STILL WANT TO GET DOWN THE AISLE TO SEE- YOU KNOW WITH WOULD LOVE TO GO CHECK IT ALL OUT- WELCOME ANYTIME YEAH I KNOW IT'S FIGURE THAT OUT I THAT. EVEN YEAH. VERY COOL I'M SO DID YOU WHERE WHERE IT SO OUR HYDROGEN JUST ONE PART OF YOUR OF YOUR PROJECT RIGHT THERE'S IT COMMITTED TO. THERE ARE YOU GUYS WORKING ON AN ELECTRIFICATION ISSUES TO. SO OUR PRIMARY FUNCTION AND THE WAY THAT THE NONPROFIT WAS SET UP. FOR DEVELOPING GAVE US OF THE ACCESS TO THIS PROPERTY WAS BECAUSE OF WORKING IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AND- SO THAT'S- RENEWABLE ENERGY OFFSHORE THINGS LIKE WAVE ENERGY- WE'VE GOT SOME INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT ARE GETTING READY TO DEMONSTRATE- OF COURSE OFFSHORE WIND BUT THE WAYS TO DO THAT THAT ARE. LESS IMPACTFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT- THERMOCLINE CAPTURING THAT THE DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE AND CENTROSAURUS ALL KINDS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY THEIR OF SECOND CLUSTER FOCUS FOR US IS- AQUACULTURE AND THAT INCLUDES GROWING GIANT KELP AQUA FARMS AS WELL AS ATLANTA AFTER BE TURNED INTO BIO FUELS AND- AND SOURCES OF ENERGY AND EVEN TURNED INTO- INTO HYDROGEN. AS WELL AS FOOD AND PHARMACEUTICALS AND THEN OUR THIRD ONE IS IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AND STUFF THE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING OUR OUR PLANET BETTER SO IT'S ALL VERY INTER RELATED ASKED US CERTAINLY AS WE PUT OUR OWN THREE POINT TWO MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING INSTALLED ON A ROOFTOP. I LOVE TO POWER SEVEN HUNDRED HOMES MUCH MORE THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE THAT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GREEN ENERGY THAT WILL BE USED FOR MAKING HYDROGEN. CRIMES AREN'T OKAY THANK YOU VEGETARIAN IN MY FILE QUESTIONS. FOR RANDY HOWARD AND- TO THE- IS FOR DIED TO BE THE HAVE I DO WHERE DID. FIT INTO THAT- WAS THAT IS THAT. HOW THANK YOU SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME AT THE BEGINNING A PRESENTATION TALK ABOUT OAKLAND OAKLAND OAKLAND IS ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. AND CBS SO THEY'RE POTENTIALLY ONE OF OUR OFTEN OCCURS. THE RAIL LINE THAT GOES TO WHAT IS AN OFF TAKER I'M I'M SORRY. SO OFTEN OCCURRED IS MEANING THAT THEY COULD UTILIZE THE HYDROGEN FUEL. FOR SHIPPING FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES DOWN AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND AIRPORT IN OAKLAND THOSE ARE OUR CUSTOMERS CURRENTLY. OR ELECTRICITY AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY MIKE I WAS JUST TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT IS WE STILL HAVE TO DO ALL THE- NORMAL ACTIVITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THOSE. BUT EVERYDAY NOT EVERYDAY BUT MANY DAYS WE HAVE TO CURTAIL SOME OF THAT ENERGY RIGHT WE DON'T NEED IT. YEAH FOR OUR PROJECT- WE'RE PROPOSING TO USE THE ACCESS. ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN STORED AND THEN COMBUSTED A WIN WIN SUN. ISN'T SHINING WIND IS BLOWING. THANK YOU REGISTER. THANK YOU ALL THE PRESENTER REALLY VERY VERY INFORMATIVE MORNING IN AND- CENTERS PLEASE IF THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION THAT POPS UP PLEASE- JUST- JUMP IN AND- THIS IS SO INTERESTING CHAU INFORMATIVE AND SO EDUCATIONAL FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS ALL- THE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING- I'VE GOT A QUESTION- FOR LAWRENCE GUYVER AND- FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR CITY AND YOUR BUS LINE- IN WE'RE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT- WE'VE GOT TO EXPAND THE PRODUCTION WE BIRD BRINGING DOWN THE COST. OF HYDROGEN- AND YET HERE YOU HAD- YOU JUST MENTIONED YOU AWARDED A GRANT FOR MORE BUSES AND SHOW- SO TELL ME HOW YOU'RE PROMOTING IT IN ARE YOU SHARING THIS WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THE OTHER CITIES IN YOUR AREA. WE ABSOLUTELY ARE CENTER OUTLET AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MISSION FOCUSED ON THAT WAS PASSED BY OUR BOARD IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THAT WE WILL NOT ONLY PROMOTE AND OPERATE ZERO MISSION BUT WILL TEACH OTHERS HOW TO DO IT. AND SO IT IS ACTUALLY PART OF OUR BOARD POLICY TO GO OUT AND HELP OTHER TRANSIT OPERATORS AND WE'RE EXPANDING THAT TO THREE OPERATORS ON THE PRIVATE SIDE. ON HOW OUR BLUEPRINT CAN WORK FOR ANYONE AND MAYBE NOT EXACTLY A SUNLINE IS PLANNED IT AND PUT IT OUT BUT PIECES AND PARTS OF OUR BLUEPRINT COULD BE REAP REPLICATED ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER. SO BY THESE PUBLIC. PUBLIC FUNDING SOURCES. PROVIDING NOT ONLY TO THE TRANSIT RIDER THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO HOW WE CAN MOVE THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY TO PRIVATE OPERATORS. IS REALLY HOW WE SEE THIS WORKING AND BACK TO SENATOR NEWMAN'S QUESTION. YOU KNOW ABOUT LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PLAN FOR SCALING OUR STATION WOULD ALLOW BOTH. PROVIDERS TO FUEL FOR BOTH TYPES OF VEHICLE TYPES TO PREVENT TO FUEL BUT AS WE SAW IT WAS WE SEE TRACKING POLL OUT MORE AND MORE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. THIS HEAVY DUTY STATION WOULD BE THE NEXT ITERATION OF WHAT WE WOULD PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC. SO WE CAN TAKE THESE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS HE'S PUBLIC FUNDING INVESTMENTS. AND TURN THEM INTO NOT ONLY HOPING A PUBLIC OPERATOR. BUT THE PRIVATE ECONOMY MOVE FORWARD WE'RE REALLY LEVERAGING THE FUNDING TO THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY IN MY OPINION. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU MENTIONED THE FUELING STATIONS. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE ALSO HEARD. THAT WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO. DESPERATELY NEEDED. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOUSAND FUELING STATION. DOWN THE ROAD UNTIL THEN- I THINK YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION ON YOUR MOBILE FUELING STATION WILL CALL IT- CAN GO HADN'T. AUGMENT THAT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY DO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN CHAU AE I'M POINTING THAT OUT BECAUSEI THINK THAT WHETHER BE THE BUS LINES OR EVEN PRIVATE CITIZENS WERE BUYING THE FUEL CELL HYDROGEN CARS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO MOBILE FEW STATIONS UNTIL WE ACTUALLY BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I'D LIKE TO TELL. TURN MY ATTENTION OVER TO- MR- TO OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- IN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR. HIS REPRESENTATION OBVIOUSLY- TYSON WE'RE SO PROUD THAT YOU'RE WITH US IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD RECENTLY IN THE NEWS IS OF COURSE THE- THE SHIPS ARE ROUTED SHORT. THE THE FREIGHT NOT GETTING INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE AND HOW TO HOW DO YOU FORESEE HYDROGEN. COMING TO THAT AREA- OF THE COASTLINE AND HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT IN IN THE FUTURE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT EUROPE YOUR LETTER THAT'S IT THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY THE POOR THINGS A LOT OF OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN CALIFORNIA YOU MAY PICK OF THE PORT OF LA LOS ANGELES THINK IT'S LIKE. 40% OF OUR CARGO CAPACITY I MEAN FOR REAL I MIGHT HAVE THE NUMBERS WRONGLY AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IN STOCK IN IT. WHEN YOU SEE ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO ACT IN A FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT COMING IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU SHOW UP THE BOARDS THAT STARTED A LECTOR FIND I DO CHEN. A BUNCH OF THE DIFFERENT SUPPORT APPOINTMENTS SO I THINK TO ME THAT'S THAT'S THE HUGE. HYDROGEN PROVIDES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE OUR PORT OPERATIONS DID YOU KNOW CLEAN THEM UP AND NOT COMPROMISE ON ANY. OF REPORT AND SO MAYBE I'D KICK IT OVER TO T. REDUCE IT YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE C. RIGHT THERE AFTER THAT. BEFORE IT. THE NAME HE WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST AFTER. OR SHOULD. ADVANTAGE ABSOLUTELY TYSON AND- NEW WAYS OF. DELIVERING GREEN HYDROGEN INTO THE STATE BECAUSE- IT WE ARE GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME TO RAMP UP OUR OUR IN STATE PRODUCTION SO. I KNOW THERE'S COMPANIES TODAY LOOKING AT- CREATING GREEN HYDROGEN IN AUSTRALIA IN SOUTH AMERICA MEXICO AND- EVEN SAUDI ARABIA- WITH SOLAR AND WIND. AND DUST SEA WATER OR- WASTE WATER. AND THEN TAKING THAT GREEN HYDROGEN TURNING IT INTO AMMONIA TO MAKE IT EASIER TO TRANSPORT- AMMONIA CAN BE USED DIRECTLY AS A FUEL IN SHIPS TODAY BUT SOME MODIFICATIONS OF COURSE BUT- AS A CLEANER FUEL AND THEN BRINGING THAT AMONG YOU HERE. RIGHT NOW. THERE'S AN AMMONIA PLANT AN AMMONIA TERMINAL IN THE PORT OF STOCKTON THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME- THAT'S CAN BE. A SOURCE OF INCOMING GREEN HYDROGEN IN THAT FORM AND THEN OF COURSE YOU JUST TURN THE AMMONIA BACK INTO HYDROGEN WHEN IT GETS HERE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S EFFORTS BY PRIVATE INVESTORS LOOKING TO BRING MORE OF THAT INTO THE STATE. BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT A TYPICAL CAR LIKE THE ONE I'M DRIVING IT NOW TAKES. FIVE KILOGRAMS A TRUCK FIFTY. WE'RE BRINGING IN A- FIVE HOUSE. ARE HARBOR- TOUR VESSEL FROM SEATTLE THAT'S JUST BEEN COAST GUARD CERTIFIED THAT USES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILOGRAMS. AND THAT'S JUST A SEVENTY FIVE PASSENGER VESSEL OBVIOUSLY LARGER SHIPS- WILL USE FAST QUANTITIES MORE WHETHER THAT'S AN ART FORM OF GASEOUS HYDROGEN OR LIQUID HYDROGEN WHICH CONTAINS EVEN MORE ENERGY DENSITY. UP BUT- BUT THAT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR CREATING. JOBS CERTAINLY WE WANT TO PRODUCE AS MUCH AS WE CAN HERE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS TO COME WITH THAT SORT OF FOR TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE COURTS. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT JOBS AND WE KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THE SKILL WILL BE NEEDED THAT IS A NEW TRANSITION FOR THE LABOR FORCE. AND I KNOW I KNOW- THE WORK FORCE IT IS WAITING- TO BE PART OF ALL THIS IN THE FUTURE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HI PAID- JOBS THAT WILL HELP THE ECONOMY WILL HELP THEIR FAMILIES AND SO ON. BUT I SEE THAT DIGENIS THEN HAS YOUR HAND UP SO JANICE- GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU- I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT AMMONIA WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW FORMULAS AND THE H. THREE. IT'S MOSTLY HYDROGEN WAS THE NITROGEN- IS USED AS AN- INGREDIENT MAKING FERTILIZER. AND SO CALIFORNIA TODAY DOES NOT PRODUCE AMMONIA WITHIN STATE WE IMPORT ALL OF IT. GO OF IT IS MADE FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND HYDROGEN. THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO VERTICALLY INTEGRATE AND PROVIDE. GREEN FERTILIZER FOR OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. AND WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING ABOUT AMMONIA IS IT'S POTENTIALLY. ON A LIQUID FUEL FOR VERY LONG HAUL SHIPPING. SO MARITIME SHIPPING MOVING GOODS BETWEEN STATES CHINA AND OUR PORTS PORT OF OAKLAND- LONG BEACH- SO THERE'S AN INTERESTING NEXUS IS HERE- INTO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THE HYDROGEN. TO THE PORTS THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE WANT TO DECARBONISE THERE'S A LOT OF DIESEL USE. BEING FOR OPERATIONS TRUCKS- IT COULD BE DELIVERED- INTERNATIONALLY THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT ARE GEARING UP TO EXPORT AMMONIA ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM CHILE SAUDI ARABIA. PERSONALLY I THINK WE COULD BE MAKING IT HERE VERY COST EFFECTIVELY AND SERVING ACTIVE OF THE- THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY ANOTHER POSSIBILITY AND WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT. WAS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY THROUGH A PIPELINE. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF COMPARISON- DELIVERY OF HYDROGEN ON A TRUCK WHICH IS HOW HYDROGEN'S DELIVERED IN FUELING STATION THE DAY. WILL COST IF YOU DIGEST FOR THE DELIVERY COMPONENT A FEW DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM. IF THAT SAME HYDROGEN WAS DELIVERED IN VOLUME YOU NEED TO HAVE A LARGER VOLUME- IT TAKES THE COST DOWN TO SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY CENTS PER KILOGRAM SO THAT'S THE POWER OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN THE FINAL THING I WANTED TO SAY IS THAT HURDLE OF LINES. THERE THERE'S NO RACIAL RISK IN THAT IN FACT THE UNITED STATES ALREADY HAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF HYDROGEN PIPELINE MOST OF IT'S IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. AND WE DO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF HYDROGEN HIGH FLYING CONNECTING THE OIL REFINERIES IN IN AND NEAR THE PORT OF LA. WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AS I MENTIONED IT'S INFORMATIVE AND THANK YOU ALL SO NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND WEIGH IN ON THE INVOLVED WHEN I MOVED TO ANYONE WAITING TO PROVIDE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND PLANNING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRED. MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY ALL OTHER WISHES TO TESTIFY I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU COULD LIMIT YOUR- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS TO THREE MINUTES. AND THOSE WILL BE OPEN TO ALL THE PANELISTS OF SO NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH THE ANYONE HERE IN ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS OUR PANELISTS AND OR THE SENATORS. THANK GOODNESS THAT YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION IF YOU HAVE ONE BUILDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARCH LETTER. AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS WOODY HASTINGS ON THE ENERGY PROGRAM MANAGER WITH THE CLIMATE CENTER TO CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE. CLIMATE AND ENERGY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WORKING TO RAPIDLY REDUCE CLIMATE POLLUTION AT SCALE STARTING IN CALIFORNIA. CLIMATE CENTER BELIEVES THAT HYDROGEN COMPLAIN A PORTENT ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT ONLY IF WE CAN CRACK THE CODE ON BRINGING DOWN THE COST. OF SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY BASED ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AS WE'VE HEARD. TOO MUCH EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED ON- I'M FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SECTOR TRANSPORTATION THAT'S RAPIDLY BECOMING ELECTRIFIED THERE'S LITTLE JUSTIFICATION AND INVESTING PUBLIC DOLLARS IN FUELING ITS INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WITH OVER A MILLION BATTERY EV'S ON THE ROAD AND MORE EVERY DAY. INVESTMENTS IN APPLICATIONS OF GREEN HYDROGEN SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THOSE HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY SUCH AS HIGH ENERGY INTENSITY INDUSTRIAL USES LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE. I IN SOME APPLICATIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THE STATE REALLY NEEDS- I SHOULD EMBARK ON A MOONSHOT TYPE PROGRAM. ALONG THE LINES OF OTHER SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS TO BRING THE COST OF ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN AND PARTICULARLY THE COST OF ELECTROLYZER. USUALLY THEMSELVES DOWN TO A POINT THAT IT MEETS OR BEATS THE COST OF STEAMER FORMED HYDROGEN. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY OF WATER- IN SCALED UP ELECTROLYSIS IN THE STATE EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCING EXTENDED DROUGHT. AND NO PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD BE MISSPENT ON APPLICATION PROJECTS THE IGNORE THE METHOD OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. POSSIBLE ENERGY BURKE THE BASED HYDROGEN INCLUDING PROJECTS THAT AIM TO INCLUDE CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE SHOULD BE DEEMED INELIGIBLE CATEGORICALLY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION IF YOU HAVE MICHAEL SMITH THANK YOU SENATOR I'M FROM RE CARBON. WERE SANTA CLARA BASED TECH- CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS INVENTED AND DEVELOPED A BREAKTHROUGH PLASMA TECHNOLOGY THAT CREATES CLEAN DE PROCESSES STRONGLY EXOTHERMIC WITH NON COMBUSTION PLASMA REACTION NOT BURNING AND CONVERTS AND TRANSFORMS GREENHOUSE GASES PARTICULARLY CARBON DIOXIDE AND METHANE INTO A NEGATIVE CARBON. HYDROGEN AND SYNGAS ON A FULL LIFE CYCLE BASIS WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE WORK OF THE OF THE STATE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HUB. WE THINK IT COULD PROVE A POSITIVE TIPPING POINT OF NEW US AT SCALE LOW CARBON ECONOMY WITH CLEAN DECARBONISE HYDROGEN IS A FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT. BRIEFLY A COUPLE KEY POINTS THAT WOULD WE THINK THE DESIGN SHOULD INCENTIVIZE CLEAN HYDROGEN MEANING ZERO OR EVEN NEGATIVE CARBON HYDROGEN TO ENSURE THE pCLIMATE GOALS OR IT'S FENCED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE INITIATIVE. SECOND LOCALLY SITES LOCALLY PRODUCED HYDROGEN SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED- GIVEN THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR IMPACT TO COMMUNITIES TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF THE JOBS REVENUE AND ECONOMIC. AFFECTS OF PARTICULARLY ADDRESSING ENERGY JUSTICE THIRD RENEWABLE SOURCES INCLUDING WAY SOURCES LANDFILL DIVERTED ORGANIC WASTE AND WASTE WATER SHOULD BE CENTERED IN THE STRATEGY. OF THE PROGRAM SHOULD BUILDING TRANSPARENCY THROUGH A DATABASE PLATFORM THAT CAN PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE BASIS FOR MONITORING OF BASIC BASED ON A CARBON INTENSITY STANDARD USING THE FULL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT- WERE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE RAINBOW APPROACH WE DO BELIEVE IN DATA AND TRANSPARENCY. AND FINALLY THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HUB SHOULD HIGHLIGHT AND INCENTIVIZE NEW INNOVATIVE TECH. LIKE WE CARBON'S NOT SOLELY ARE REFLECTING A CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION LEADER SMR IS AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY ELECTROLYSIS IS A HUNDRED FORTY YEARS OLD WHILE THESE TECHNOLOGIES WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A ROLE. IN THE GROWING. BUT RATHER LOOK AT THE NEW REMARKABLE AND CLIMATE POSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH WILL PROMISE MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACHES THE BUILDING A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HYDROGEN ECONOMY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PER- PARTICIPATING GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH YOUR PRESENTATION IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED LIKE MAKE A- PRESENTATION. I SEE NO OTHERS. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN- BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION NOW MOVE ON TO THE WITNESS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA THE TELECONFERENCE SERVICE MODERATOR. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPTLY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL BEGIN NOW COMMENT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME IN EIGHTEEN T. SPECIALIST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER WE WILL OPEN AFTER LINE AT WHEN WE ARE READY. WILL FIRST GO TO LINE SIXTY THREE. THANK YOU MODERATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCH ALETTA MY NAME IS TOMMY REILLY GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANAGER ON THE WEST COAST FOR AIR PRODUCTS. AIR PRODUCTS IS THE LARGEST US BASED GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL GAS COMPANY AND THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF HYDROGEN IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND OPERATE AND SAFELY MAINTAIN NINE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE THIRTEEN HUNDRED METRIC TONS OF HYDROGEN PER DAY. WE ALSO OWN AND OPERATE ABOUT THIRTY MILES OF HYDROGEN PIPELINE IN CALIFORNIA MOSTLY LOCATED IN AND AROUND THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH. ALL OF YOUR PRODUCT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITH PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING TO SERVE CLEAR MARKET NEEDS. AIR PRODUCTS IS RESPONDING TO THE GLOBAL NEED TO DECARBONISE WITH OVER TWELVE BILLION IN INVESTMENTS ALREADY ANNOUNCED TO DECARBONISE THE GLOBAL HYDROGEN SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDING PROJECTS IN ARIZONA THE GULF COAST CANADA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AND WE STAND READY TO BRING SIGNIFICANT GREEN HYDROGEN INVESTMENT TO CALIFORNIA IT IS CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT OF POLICIES AND THE COMPETITIVE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THE GREEN HYDROGEN MARKETS TO SCALE AND ATTRACT HYDROGEN HUB FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THEIR PRODUCTS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND EVERYONE TO ADVANCE GREEN HYDROGEN AND FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN HUBS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- COMMENTS AND PRESENTATION- MODERATOR NEXT ONE AFTERNOON SENATORS THIS IS SERRA GROWTH IN ORDER TO ASSESS I AM CALLING THIS AFTERNOON EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMANDING ZERO AIR POLLUTION TECHNOLOGY IS AN BOTH THE PRODUCTION AND THE USE OF HIGHER CHEN AND I NEED PUBLICLY FUNDED HYDROGEN HUB- TO START WITH THE PRODUCTION SIDE. THANKS TO MS LANDS PRESENTATION ARE THIS MORNING WE KNOW THAT IN EUROPE- HURRICANE HUBS ARE GETTING OFF THE GROUND RELYING SOLELY ON TRULY ZERO EMISSION RENEWABLE ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN- CALIFORNIA SHOULD DEMAND NO WILL LEFT. EARTHJUSTICE IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND BIOGAS FROM INDUSTRIAL WIND AND ADLEMAN YOU WORK ON WRITING COURAGE EVERYONE IF YOU READ A REALLY FANTASTIC EXPOSE IN YESTERDAY'S LOS ANGELES TIMES. ABOUT THE WAY THAT- INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THE NEW WAR AND THAT THE OFF GASSING THAT NEWER IS ENCOURAGING INCREASED THE PRODUCTION AND WITH THAT- HARMING LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES- AND FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THE CREATIVE CARBON ACCOUNTING BY WHICH INDUSTRY CLAIMS THAT THIS GAS IS ZERO CARBON. IS COLD COMFORT- TO THIS ABOUT HOW TO USE HYDROGEN BONTA PRODUCED- THERE ARE CONTRASTING ZERO EMISSION WE IS A FUSING HYDROGEN IN FUEL CELLS. ARE BUT THERE ARE ALSO WAYS OF USING HYDROGEN BURNING AT THAT INCREASES OUR ARMED LONG FARMING COLLUDED IN LIFE NOT. AND FOR INSTANCE THE ONE THE REALLY TROUBLING. BOTTLE TWO ONE THREE PROPOSALS THAT OFFENDERS NEED TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST. BEFORE DOESN'T BECOME A REALITY IS LENDING HYDROGEN INTO THE GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THAT SERVES OUR HOME AND BUSINESS- BECAUSE ABOUT HOW. HI IN OUR THE WORD IS TO BURN THE IN WOULD PRODUCE MORE KNOCKS EMISSIONS- THAN THEY ALREADY ARE AND MANY OF THOSE INCREASE EMISSIONS WOULD CALM AND SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED AIR BASINS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THERE'S JUST NO ROOM FOR THOSE TYPES OF INCREASED EMISSIONS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON- AND I. REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. BOTH YOU SO MUCH PRESENT. OF THE MODERATOR NEXT ONE PLEASE. LINE. SIXTY NINE. YES GO AHEAD. THREE THANK YOU FOR SIGNING FROM THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL THANK YOU CAN ARTS WHAT IT AND NUMBER FOR HAVING US ON THE COMMITTEE AND HOLDING THE- AND A WONDERFUL INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I JUST LIKE THE HIGHLY RESPECTED THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL IS MADE UP OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MEMBER COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN- I WOULD JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BUT IF THE SESSION TODAY- WE ENCOURAGE POLICY MAKERS TO. CONTINUE TO EVALUATE HOW YOU CAN ON A CARBON INTENSITY SCALE I KNOW SOMEONE HAD JUST MADE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT I WON'T. REALLY GOING FOR THE GREEN WITH THEM- I DO HAVE A GREAT THE CARBONIZATION POTENTIAL ALONG WITH IMPROVING AIR QUALITY DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A MISSION. WE JUST WANT TO INSURE ALL MAKERS TO ABOUT HOW TO UPDATE I WENT ON SAME. ALL ALTERNATIVES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND FOR THE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE. ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THAT HEARING TODAY WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGE ON THE HIGH. OF THE SESSION AND- WE SUPPORT OUR MEMBERS EFFORTS AND GETTING INVOLVED. THANK YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY. THANK YOU THEN THANK THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MEMBERS AND THEY WITH THEIR COMPANIES- MODERATOR NEXT ONE. BY. FIFTY SEVEN. AFTERNOON THURMAN ARCHULETA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JULIA LEVIN WITH THE BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA I WANT TO ADD MY THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS INCREDIBLY EXCITING AND INFORMATIVE INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON MY COMMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON REALLY ONE BIG ISSUE WHICH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING HYDROGEN FROM ORGANIC WASTE AND BIOGAS IN ANY DEFINITION OR PROGRAM FOCUSED ON GREEN HYDROGEN OR CLEAN HYDROGEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD. LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORIES TO REPORT I'M GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY TWO YEARS AGO THAT MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND IT BY FAR THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS IS CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO HYDROGEN AD OTHER CARBON NEGATIVE FUEL AND ENERGY SOURCES BUT BY FAR THE MOST BENEFICIAL AND USE. OR ALTERNATIVE TO LANDFILLING AND OPEN BURNING OF ORGANIC WASTE IS CONVERTING IT HYDROGEN AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE USE HYDROGEN TO REPLACE DIESEL. CALIFORNIA IN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ORGANIC WASTE. OTHER- PILED AND BURNED PILED AND LEFT TO DECAY OR SENT TO LANDFILLS ALL OF WHICH RELEASED VERY VERY POWERFUL AND DAMAGING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT- SO BY CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO HYDROGEN NOT ONLY DO WE PROVIDE CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. BUT WE CAN REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WHICH IS THE MOST URGENT STEP WE NEED TO TAKE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT. I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE COMMENTS THAT CARRIED HIM IN AND HONEST LYNN. THERESA COOK AND OTHERS MADE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING DEFINITIONS OF CLEAN HYDROGEN OR GREEN HYDROGEN. THAT ARE BASED ON LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS AND NOT. CATEGORICALLY DEEMING SOME FORMS OF HYDROGEN CLEAN OR GREEN- BASED ON. FEEDSTOCK OR SINGLE POINT IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE CONSIDER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES AND CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES. I AM DOING SO I THINK WILL REALLY HELP US TO GO TO CREATE HYDROGEN ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MODERATOR NEXT ONE. LINE. SIXTY SEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND DINNER NEWMAN AND TO THE BEST FLIGHT COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE BUSINESS MY NAME IS BRADY BORDERING I'M WITH FUEL CELL ENERGY- WHERE US THIS MANUFACTURE- STATIONARY FUEL CELLS- BRING CONNECTICUT AND WE ARE DEVELOPING TO HYDROGEN APPLICATIONS- ONE ON THE ELECT. SOLID OXIDE ELECTROLYSIS DIED AND ANOTHER THAT USES- WASTE GAS LIKE BIO GAS TO CONVERT INTO HYDROGEN. FUEL CELLS TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN WITHOUT ANY COMBUSTION- MEANING NO CARCINOGENIC OR SMOG FORMING POLLUTION LIKE KNOCKS OUR SOCKS OR PM TWO POINT FIVE WE CAN USE RENEWABLE METHANE FROM WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS OR LANDFILLS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CITIES- AS THE FEEDSTOCK- WE CAN ALSO COUPLE THE USE OF GREEN ENERGY AND RECYCLED WATER ELECTROLYSIS PROCESS TO CREATE HYDROGEN. WHICH WOULD TRULY HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON PRECIOUS. RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IT STAYS. AND JUST TO TALK TOUCH A LITTLE BIT MORE THE BIO GAS. OUR FUEL CELLS USE CHEMISTRY INTERNALLY. TO REFORM METHANE INTO HYDROGEN AND IN SOME CASES ELECTRICITY AS WELL PREVENTING THE HARMFUL EMISSIONS AND PARTICULATE MATTER THAT COMES FROM. BURNING OR REFORMING OF METHANE THROUGH. SB METHANE REFORMING PROCESS WHICH IS MOST COMMON TODAY. ACTION OF GOVERNOR GRAY HYDROGEN- THAT'S WHAT WE THINK ARE BIOGAS HYDROGEN APPLICATION AT THE MOMENT GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE GREEN HYDROGEN UPPER EHICLES FOR EVERY DUTY FLEETS- POTENTIALLY TO SELL HYDROGEN- AS A WAY TO GENERATE REVENUE OR OR EVEN AS AN ON SITE ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS- INTO BECAUSE THAT'S THE FUEL CELLS USES BY A GUEST ON SITE- WE THINK WHICH WATER FACILITIES CAN REALLY HARNESS OUR TECHNOLOGY- IN THIS WAY FOR REVENUE GENERATION. THEY CAN POTENTIALLY USE WASTE HEAT RECOVERY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR DIGEST HERS AND ESPECIALLY THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE SPEAK OR CENTER LARA'S BILL AS THE AT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE COME INTO EFFECT WITH. ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION. I JUST ADDED NOTE. WE ARE THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A- TWO POINT EIGHT MEGAWATT FUEL CELL SYSTEM AT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH IN CONJUNCTION WITH TOYOTA. AND THAT PROJECT WILL TAKE- BIO GAS AND CONVERT IT INTO ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED. WITH OVER A THOUSAND KILOGRAMS OF HYDROGEN TODAY GREEN HYDROGEN AND ALSO PRODUCE. GREENLIT TRISTIQUE TO BE SOLD BACK TO EDISON'S GRAND. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT BOTH BECAUSE IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THREE HYDROGEN BEING PRODUCED IN THE MALAY BASIN BUT ALSO BECAUSE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND YOUR PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IS TO PROVIDE A CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKET THAT'S WHY WILL BE THERE. WE SEE THIS PROJECT IS AN ANCHOR PROJECT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG WITH SEVEN TEN QUARTER ON THE GOODS MOVING INTO THE AN INLAND EMPIRE ALONG BY CHANCE. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. YOU SEND REGULATE INTENDED% NEWMAN AND GENERALITY THAT WHICH YOU TO COME DOWN TO THE PROJECT LONG BEACH AND SEE THE WORLD. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION- WE'RE HERE WE'LL TAKE A LOOK WE'RE BOTH FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THAT IMITATION. A MODERATOR NEXT UP. ONE THIRTY FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON- ARCHULETA ABLE TO THE- I'M THE CITY MANAGER WITH THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO. WE OPERATE THE FOURTH LARGEST MUNICIPAL FLEET AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SIX NINE BUSES ABOUT THE GAS BUSES. BUSES THAT WERE GROWING- TWO EIGHTY- HYDROGEN BUSES SO WHEN THE PROCESS OF- GOING TOWARDS AFTER CHEN- ARE ARE CHALLENGES OBVIOUSLY AS AS MANY ARE SEEKING FUNDING FOR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S GONNA BE KEY FOR US TO GET OUR CONSTRUCTION PLACE SO WE CAN FUEL OUR BUSES. WILL BE SEEKING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT SO WILL BE- WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS THAT I'VE READ THAT THANK YOU FOR THE MODERATORS- BILLY WILDER- COMMENT ON SOMEONE AND THE GREAT WORKING IN THE MUNICIPAL. BOND INDUSTRY WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL SO AGAIN WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE YOU LEADERSHIP AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STATE AND OUR PARTNERS THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU RENEE INTO MY YEAH SHUT OUT THE CITY OF MONTEBELLO THAT IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND I'M EXCITED TO HEAR YOUR FUTURES EIGHTY BUSES HYDROGEN SO WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU NEED TO GET WITH THE PARTNERS WE JUST HEARD WITH- SO THEN WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GET A GOOD HOLD ON IT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. OF MODERATOR NEXT CALLER. BY NINE. YOUR CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE YOUTH SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WE WANT TO THANK YOU THIS COMMITTEE AND- YOUR EFFORTS ON HYDROGEN ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER END USE THIS IS A PROBLEM I THINK ZERO EMISSION SOLUTION AND WE FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON ITS COMMITMENT TO IT. INCLUDING FUNDING THE NECESSARY FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT FIELD- VEHICLES OF ALL SIZES. THE SACRAMENTO AIR DISTRICT IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN THE REGION. I TO PROMOTE A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SOLUTIONS AND BECAME A MODEL OF COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION FOR LEVERAGING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE REGION IS TEAMING UP WITH ZERO CARBON MOBILITY ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE FIRST HYDROGEN LOCOMOTIVE FUEL CELL RECTOR OF THAT PROJECT AT THE PORT OF SACRAMENTO- AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK YOU- WE INVITE YOU TO COME SEE THIS PROJECT IN THE MAKING. MADE POSSIBLE BY THE FUNDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO. ENGAGING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND BECOMING A LEADING VOICE FOR GREEN HYDROGEN ENERGY INDEED SACRAMENTO VALLEY THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU AS WE ARE ALL HERE- THE- CLEAN THAT- SACRAMENTO CITY CALIFORNIA- ACROSS THE NATION AND SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING. AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES IS FIGHTING HARD TO GET AS THE MAJORITY OF THAT MONEY THAT- SO. DESPERATELY NEEDED TO OPEN THE GATES UP FOR HYDROGEN- INCALIFORNIA SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. MODERATOR WHO'S UP NEXT. NEXT TO NUMBER. NINE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHAEL WHEELER AND I LEAVE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR INSTACART THANK YOU CHAIR ARCHULETA IN THE COMMITTEE FOR ORGANIZING A FANTASTIC AND INFORMATIVE HEARING AND MY THANKS ALSO GOES TO GO BILLS FOR ITS ATTENTION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO. ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN GREEN HYDROGEN TO CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A POWER THE CLEAN ENERGY COMPANY ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE SOUTHWEST. CURRENTLY WE ARE BUILDING SOME OF THE LARGEST ZERO CARBON SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR UNDER CONSTRUCTION MOSTLY ALONG THE I. TEN CORRIDOR UNION LABOR US MANUFACTURED SOLAR MODULES AND US MANUFACTURED BATTERY SYSTEMS AND WE'RE ALREADY PLANNING ELECTROLYTIC GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IN OTHER STATES AT SCALE. AND ARE READY TO DO SO WITH SOME OF THE SITES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF PLANNED PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA USEFUL FOR THE UNIFIED CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HOW PROPOSAL. MY COMMENT FOR THE COMMITTEE HAS TO DO WITH SCALE. WE BELIEVE THAT TO SUCCEED IN STANDING UP A GREEN HYDROGEN INDUSTRY IT WILL BE CRITICAL THAT THE STATE INVEST IN LARGE SCALE EFFORTS TO PRODUCE GREEN HYDROGEN. KEEP THE LEVELIZED COST OF HYDROGEN DOWN MAKING IT ATTRACTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS WE MUST BUILD BIG. THIS MEANS GIGAWATT SCALE GENERATION LEVERAGING DEDICATED SOLAR AND WIND GENERATION WITH ONSITE ELECTROLYSIS. KEEPING IT ALL CO LOCATED AVOID BURDENING OUR EXISTING TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WITH NEW LOANS IT KEEPS THE COST OF THE GREEN HYDROGEN DOWN BY AVOIDING THOSE TRANSMISSION CHARGES. CRITICAL HOWEVER TO THIS EFFORT IS THE PIPELINE TRANSPORTER OF THE GREEN HYDROGEN PROJECT PRODUCT EITHER THROUGH BLENDING IN NATURAL GAS PIPELINES OR IN NEWS DEDICATED HYDROGEN PIPELINES AND WE'RE THRILLED WITH THE REMARKS OF A NUMBER OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY REGARDING SUPPORT FOR PIPELINES INCLUDING SO CAL GAS. GREEN HYDROGEN COALITION IN NOR CAL POWER AGENCY THANKS AGAIN FOR THE TIME SPENT TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I WAS INFORMED THAT WE HAVE TO REMAINING SPEAKERS SO- THANK YOU ALSO STAND BY LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS HAVE TO SAY SO- MODERATOR BRING ON- THE NEXT WEEK OR. IN SPEAK YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MY WRITER WOULD YOU ASK ONE MORE TIME. A YES WE WILL GO TO LINE SIXTY EIGHT. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS CHRISTINE HOUSTON WITH THE PORT OF LONG BEACH THANK YOU SENATOR ISOLATED FOR YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND LEADERSHIP IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF HYDROGEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO THANK YOU TED PEYTON ACKERLEY FOR YOUR WORK CREATING THE CAT WITH THIS INITIATIVE PART OF LONG BEACH IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC ENGINE NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE NATION WE PREFER THAT EVERYTHING RUNS SMOOTHLY AND THAT WERE NOT IN THE SPOTLIGHT AFTER THAT WE AVE BEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT IN SPITE OF MYRIAD PROBLEMS WE HAVE MOVED TO RECORD AMOUNTS OF CARGO SINCE MID TWENTY TWENTY THE CARD WILL BENEFIT EVERYONE BUT THE IMPACTS ARE FELT ACUTELY BY OUR NEIGHBORS MOSTLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. PARTS OF LONG BEACH MY ANGELES ADOPTED AGGRESSIVE ZERO MISSION GOALS FOR OUR MARINE TERMINALS. AND THE SUPPORTING TRACKING INDUSTRY. AND WHILE WE REMAIN NEUTRAL ABOUT HOW ZERO EMISSIONS ARE ACHIEVED WE KNOW THAT HYDROGEN WILL PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN THIS EFFORT. FOR THE CREATION OF A ONE OR MORE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN HUBS HOPEFULLY TWO IN CALIFORNIA. AND BELIEVE THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS IMPORTANT AT THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION IS THE LOGICAL PLACE FOR ONE OF THEM. IN LONG BEACH WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WILMINGTON WELL FILLED WITH A VAST NETWORK OF OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND IT MAKES SENSE TO REPURPOSE THE IS RIGHT THE WAY. PROVIDERS INCONVENIENCE ESPECIALLY WITH THE PORT AS TERMINUS SO THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER CLASS HEADED IMPOSSIBLE IN THE SEAPORT INDUSTRY. AND ALSO PROVIDE A CONDUIT FOR THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AND AMMONIA. WE ASK THAT ANY LEGISLATION PASSED IN CALIFORNIA ALLOWS STATE AGENCIES IN GRANT APPLICANTS. TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS. NOT ONLY THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL BUT OTHERS SUCH AS REPRESENTATIVE KATIE PORTER HYDROGEN TRUCK ACT IN HYDROGEN PURPORTS THAT. SHOULD THEY BE SIGNED INTO LAW. A LOT OF MONEY WILL BE NEEDED IN VARIOUS SECTORS INCLUDING THE TESTING AND MANUFACTURE OF FUEL CELL CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT A MARINE TERMINAL. FEEL FELT HEAVY DUTY TRACTOR BEING DEMONSTRATED NOW BUT THE COST OF THESE VEHICLES FAR EXCEED WHAT ARE LOCAL TRUCK OWNERS WHO NUMBER IN THE THOUSANDS CAN AFFORD. ALSO AS CALIFORNIANS INCREASE THEIR USE OF ELECTRICITY AND AT THE SAME TIME OUR CLIMATE CHANGES RENEWABLE HYDROGEN COMPLAIN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENHANCING RESILIENCE AND MAKING UTILITY GRID MORE RELIABLE. FUEL CELLS CAN BE USED TO BALLOTS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND DEMAND BOTH AS A LOCAL ENERGY RESOURCES AND IN UTILITY SCALE APPLICATIONS. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE CALIFORNIA STATE THE AGENCIES ARE FUNDED AS PART OF ANY HYDROGEN ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM. COMMENCEMENT BE TRAINED AND READY TO ENSURE THE HYDROGEN PROJECTS ARE SAFE. AND THAT PERMIT APPROVAL FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT DELAYED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND YES THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS- THAT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT THEIR VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT SOMEONE- MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE NUMBER FIFTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE- IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING DAY IN IT BUT IF I REALLY I'M THE LAST ONE I GET THE CLOTHES OUT BY AMPLIFYING SOME OF THE PREVIOUS POINT. MY NAME IS DAVE EDWARDS I WORK FOR A COMPANY CALLED EHRLICH HE'D WHAT INDUSTRIAL PROVIDER OF HYDROGEN INTO THE MARKET AND HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY TRANSITION FOR MANY YEARS NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE I LIKE TO FOCUS ON A FEW FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE. FIRST OFF YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE HOME ITSELF THAT IS MOST INTERESTING TO INDUSTRY BUT RATHER THE OUTCOME OF A REGIONAL MARKET SUSTAINABLE WHAT ALLOWS FOR GROWTH IN A GOING PRIVATE INVESTMENT MEASURED IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WANTED TO INCREASE IT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR US. THE QUESTION OF WHY CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED BUT THEY REALLY COME DOWN TO A SINGLE WORD UNEDITED MOMENTUM WE HAVE MOMENTUM WITH THE POLICY GROUNDWORK BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM BUT STILL BEING PLANNED. CALIFORNIA IS READY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS NOW UNLIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER HUB REGIONS WHICH ARE STILL IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY PORTFOLIOS. IN A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW POLICY HAS MADE CHANGES ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA IS THE ANSWER TO ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP EARLIER THAT AND HOW DO WE TRANSITION TO GREEN HYDROGEN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS ALMOST EVERY MOLECULE OF HYDROGEN IS GOING INTO A FUEL CELL VEHICLE TODAY. IS ALREADY RENEWABLE. LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND THE OTHER POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA OUR STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT FOR US TO DEVELOP FURTHER GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND BUILD ON THIS PLANET THINKS THAT. PUTTING IT IS ACTUALLY TWO YEARS AHEAD OF WHERE THE ELECTRIC GRID. IN THE STATE- TODAY. SECOND QUESTION I RAISED IN A LIKE TO ORDER. IS HOW TO PRIORITY. PROJECTS OR THE LONG WAY OF. PROJECTS WITH THE STATE. WE WOULD. THAT PRIOR TO THE BE GIVEN THE VOTE PRODUCTS THAT ARE READY FOR INVEST. TODAY THAT HAVE MEASURE CONTRIBUTION TOWARD THE OUTCOMES OF THE ECONOMY THE ENVIRONMENT. AND SOCIETY AND CAN BE ACTED UPON IMMEDIATELY. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER TALKED ABOUT THE SCALE OF FANTASTIC MEASURABLE SUCCESS AND REALLY DRIVE IN ALL THREE AREAS. WE BELIEVE THIS COULD BE DONE. IF WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON A CALIFORNIA HOW BUILT AROUND RENEWABLE PRODUCTION. AND THEN AIMED AT THOSE HARD TO DISPLAY SECTORS THAT ARE READY FOR SCALE ESPECIALLY IN TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU SIR AS A VERY MUCH- AS YOU ALL HEARD. PRESENTATIONS FROM THE PANEL OF PRESENTATION EVEN FROM THE PEOPLE CALLING IN. WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH WE'RE ALL TRYING TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH INFORMATION ON THE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO BEFORE WE- GO ON I'D LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR CLOSING REMARKS. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO PARTICIPATED TODAY PERFECTLY THOSE FOLKS WHO CALLED IN FROM THE PUBLIC- TOWARD THE END- IF THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. I DO WANT TO PUSH BACK POLITELY- TO THE MISTER HASTINGS- REGARDING THE ROLE OF LIGHT DUTY JUDGE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA MEET ITS VERY AGGRESSIVE GOALS ON DECARBONISING OUR VEHICLE FLEET- THE FUEL CELL VEHICLES ARE GONNA SHOULD PLAY A PART THERE. THERE'S A COHORT. OF DRIVERS FOR WHOM ELECTRIC VEHICLES DON'T CURRENTLY MAKES SENSE. AND YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET TO THOSE GOALS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE THOSE ACCOMMODATIONS. HAVING SAID THAT THANK YOU MR CHEER ESPECIALLY TO YOUR STEP MISTER ACTOR FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. AND I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND I KNOW THAT. YOU'RE WITH ME A 100% ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND BRING- THE PUBLIC TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND.

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOUNG- AND HIS STAFF FOR PROVIDING US. THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO GO AHEAD AND FIGHT- IN TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT LEFT OUT. WHEN THE DOLLARS AND CENTS COME THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WE EXACTLY NEED. TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN SO MANY DOORS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK OUR PANELISTS I EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. AS IN LIGHTNESS WITH YOUR EXPERTISE AND CERTAINLY YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF OUR FUTURE AND HOW CALIFORNIA WILL. WILL PLAY A ROLE WHETHER IT BE. WITH THE HUB WHETHER IT BE WITH JOBS AND WHETHER IT BE- WITH THE UNIVERSITIES THAT WILL BE PARTICIPATING. AND JUVENTUS BUT EMPHASIZED THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. THAT IS A JOINT VENTURE AND IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN BETWEEN ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER. SO IT IS THE FUTURE WE ARE IN THE BRINK OF EXPANDING THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILLS. AND THE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT. WILL BE BEFORE US SO I HOPE THAT EVERYONE WILL EMBRACE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND THAT STAY WITH US AS WE GROW AND IN THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO NOW I'D LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AND THAT IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO TESTIFY. VIA TELECONFERENCE- PLEASE SEND THIS- ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE IN WRITING. TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HYDROGEN AND ENERGY. AT OR WAS VISIT OUR WEBSITE. YOUR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE BEEN IMPORTANT TO US AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN YOUR TIME- WE ARE GOING TO. HOPEFULLY HAVE MORE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS- IN THE FUTURE IT WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING. SO I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PATIENCE.
