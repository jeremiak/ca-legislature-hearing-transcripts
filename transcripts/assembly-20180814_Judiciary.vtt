DURING HIS CONFESSION HE STATED

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:49.767 region:rollup2
THAT HE HATED M AND WANTED TO

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:52.270 region:rollup2
HURT ME.

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:53.872 region:rollup2
AND HE DID.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.706 region:rollup2
HE HURT ME IN THE DEEPEST AND

00:37:53.872 --> 00:37:57.475 region:rollup2
MOST INHUMANE POSSIBLE WAY

00:37:54.706 --> 00:38:00.111 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:37:57.475 --> 00:38:01.446 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH IT TOOK ME FORTY YEARS

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.313 region:rollup2
TO BRING MY BEAUTIFUL SON INTO

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:03.648 region:rollup2
THIS WORLD.

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:08.753 region:rollup2
IT TOOK HIS FATHER APPROXIMATELY

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:10.155 region:rollup2
FOUR MINUTES TO END HIS LIFE.

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:12.190 region:rollup2
MY NEW REALITY IS THAT I WILL

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:14.826 region:rollup2
NEVER SEE MY SON AGAIN.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:16.794 region:rollup2
AT LEAST NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.

00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:17.295 region:rollup2
AND BEING A SURVIVOR OF VIOLENT

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:20.331 region:rollup2
CRIME COMES WITH A LIFE

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:21.633 region:rollup2
SENTENCE.

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:24.736 region:rollup2
FOR ME THAT SENTENCE IS HAVING

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:26.971 region:rollup2
TO LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT MY SON.

00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:28.673 region:rollup2
SO I AM HERE TODAY TESTIFYING ON

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:30.942 region:rollup2
Y. CHILD SAFETY IS OF SUCH

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:33.111 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE.

00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:34.646 region:rollup2
MY SON'S DEATH WAS PREVENTABLE.

00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:35.814 region:rollup2
AND SO WHERE THE FIFTY TWO OTHER

00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:38.149 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO WERE MURDERED IN

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:39.684 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BY A PARENT.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.852 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR COURT RELATED

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:42.253 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS IS ABSOLUTELY

00:38:40.852 --> 00:38:44.122 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND SHOULD NOT BE AN

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:46.090 region:rollup2
OPTION.

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:47.625 region:rollup2
THE JUDGES AND CUSTODY EVALUATOR

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.495 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN MY DIVORCE CLEARLY

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:52.330 region:rollup2
MADE UNEDUCATED DECISIONS.

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:54.232 region:rollup2
AND JUDGES AND EVALUATORS ARE

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.234 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVANTS WHOSE ROLE.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:58.036 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE LAW.

00:38:56.234 --> 00:39:00.438 region:rollup2
IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH THE

00:38:58.036 --> 00:39:02.173 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND WELFARE OF CHILDREN.

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
IN MY CASE AS IN MANY OTHERS

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:06.311 region:rollup2
THEY FAIL TO UPHOLD FAMILY CODE

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:07.445 region:rollup2
THEY FAILED MY SON.

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY CONTINUE

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:12.450 region:rollup2
TO FAIL MANY OTHERS.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.051 region:rollup2
IT IS MY HOPE THAT TO RECOGNIZE

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.818 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING

00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:16.054 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:17.789 region:rollup2
AND ESTABLISH A SENSE OF URGENCY

00:39:16.054 --> 00:39:20.225 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO TRULY MAKING

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:21.759 region:rollup2
CHILD SAFETY A PRIORITY.

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:24.629 region:rollup2
NOTHING I DO WILL EVER BRING

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:27.065 region:rollup2
WAIKIKI BACK.

00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:28.399 region:rollup2
AND I PERSONALLY HAVE NOTHING TO

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:30.802 region:rollup2
TO GAIN BY BEING HERE TODAY.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:33.671 region:rollup2
AS I HAVE ALREADY LOST.

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:35.640 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS DEAR TO ME?

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.574 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK HERE BEFORE YOU.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.611 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT ANOTHER

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:41.012 region:rollup2

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:44.382 region:rollup2

GETTING ASSIGNED TO THE WRONG

GENDER --

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:18.936 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO THEN GROW UP AND DIE

00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:23.006 region:rollup2

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:32.582 region:rollup2
I CHANGE THAT PERSON'S BODY THAT

00:57:31.715 --> 00:57:33.517 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT.

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.952 region:rollup2
INFORMED WITH THEIR OWN GENDER

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:36.954 region:rollup2

00:57:34.952 --> 00:57:38.188 region:rollup2
ASIDE FROM THAT OBVIOUS RISK.

00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:40.157 region:rollup2
A THESE THE REVERSAL SURGERIES

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:42.659 region:rollup2
CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT LOSS OF

SEXUAL SENSATIONS STERILIZATION

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:47.898 region:rollup2
INCONTINENCE AND A VARIETY OF

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:50.834 region:rollup2
SEVERE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS --

00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:52.636 region:rollup2
AT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:53.770 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT THIS RESOLUTION STATES

00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:55.272 region:rollup2
IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:56.873 region:rollup2
DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER TO

00:57:55.272 --> 00:57:57.441 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT SURGERY.

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:59.409 region:rollup2
SET UP FOR ME AT WHEN THEIR

BABY.

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.243 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT MEDICALLY

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:02.846 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:04.448 region:rollup2
LET'S LET THESE.

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:06.116 region:rollup2
KIDS DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES

00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:07.751 region:rollup2
EXPRESS THEIR VENDOR.

00:58:06.116 --> 00:58:09.086 region:rollup2
DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO HAVE THE

00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:14.257 region:rollup2
SURGERY IF THEY WANT TO TAKE --

00:58:09.086 --> 00:58:15.325 region:rollup2
THOSE RISKS --

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:17.027 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:19.262 region:rollup2
ABOUT A CONGENITAL ADRENAL

00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:20.997 region:rollup2
HYPERPLASIA OR CA H. --

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:23.200 region:rollup2
WHICH CAN CAUSE INTERSECTS

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:24.668 region:rollup2
TRAITS --

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.970 region:rollup2
INFANTS BORN WITH CA H.

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:28.605 region:rollup2
GENERALLY REQUIRE A VARIETY OF

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.340 region:rollup2
MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS. TO

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:31.408 region:rollup2
PREVENT SEVERE HARM OR EVEN

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.576 region:rollup2
DEATH FROM DANGEROUSLY LOW

00:58:31.408 --> 00:58:34.978 region:rollup2
LEVELS.

00:58:32.576 --> 00:58:37.481 region:rollup2
T. ADRENAL HORMONES --

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:38.015 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE DON'T OPPOSE IN ANYWAY

00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:39.449 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FOR THAT MEDICAL

00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:40.817 region:rollup2
CONDITION.

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.419 region:rollup2
INVASIVE GENITAL SURGERIES

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:45.288 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN NO WAY TREAT THAT

00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:46.423 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING CONDITION --

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:48.392 region:rollup2
SO -- THIS

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:49.826 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ABOUT ALLOWING PEOPLE

00:58:48.392 --> 00:58:51.895 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES ABOUT

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:53.196 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN BODIES --

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:54.631 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE AN

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:56.099 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:58.068 region:rollup2

HYPERPLASIA.

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.919 region:rollup2
I GREW UP HAPPILY WITHOUT

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:51.221 region:rollup2
COSMETIC CLITORAL REDUCTION

00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:52.956 region:rollup2

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:55.392 region:rollup2
I HAD NO PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE AT

00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:57.160 region:rollup2
BIRTH SO WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT

00:59:55.392 --> 00:59:58.395 region:rollup2
UNTIL I WAS SIX AT THAT AGE MY

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.464 region:rollup2

00:59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.431 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY MASCULINE TRAITS.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.799 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE GENITAL

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.201 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES I DEVELOPED MY

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:06.069 region:rollup2
DOCTORS WANTED TO SURGICALLY

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:08.138 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE SIZE OF MY* BY

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:09.573 region:rollup2
THE WAY 39% OF PATIENTS IN ONE

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:11.374 region:rollup2
STUDY WHO HAD THE SURGERY COULD

01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:12.943 region:rollup2
NOT ORGASM AS ADULTS.

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.543 region:rollup2
THE DOCTORS WANTED TO MAKE THAT

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.845 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR ME AS A SIX YEAR

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.213 region:rollup2
OLD.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:17.948 region:rollup2
I GOT LUCKY MY MOM KNEW A

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.548 region:rollup2
COSMETIC CLITORAL REDUCTION

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.749 region:rollup2
WASN'T SOMETHING HER SIX YEAR

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.151 region:rollup2
OLD NEEDED.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:23.220 region:rollup2
SHE TOLD THE DOCTORS NOW AND I

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:24.421 region:rollup2
AM SO GRATEFUL.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.722 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY MOM KNEW WHAT

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:27.190 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS TO ASK IN BECAUSE SHE

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.991 region:rollup2
WASN'T AFRAID OF RAISING A CHILD

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.525 region:rollup2
WHOSE BODY WAS A LITTLE

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:30.594 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:32.028 region:rollup2
I WAS SAVED FROM AN INVASIVE NON

CONSENSUAL GENITAL SURGERY.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:35.131 region:rollup2
LOTS OF LOVING PARENTS MIGHT NOT

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:36.133 region:rollup2
KNOW TO SPEAK UP BECAUSE THEY

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.167 region:rollup2
WANT TO BELIEVE THE DOCTORS

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.668 region:rollup2
WOULD ONLY ADVOCATE WHAT'S BEST

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:40.370 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.304 region:rollup2
MANY DOCTORS TELL PARENTS THAT

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.873 region:rollup2
KIDS LIKE ME WILL BE BULLIED

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.040 region:rollup2
VIRGIN LITTLE DIFFERENCES BUT

01:00:42.873 --> 01:00:45.342 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE NO DATA ON THIS

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.244 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICAL HARM.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.378 region:rollup2
AS A CA AGE TEAM LOCKER ROOM

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:49.679 region:rollup2

WORRIES COMPARED TO FUTURE

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:52.449 region:rollup2
SEXUAL FUNCTION DOCTORS ARE

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.417 region:rollup2
STILL OPERATING ON THEIR

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:55.852 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS INSTEAD OF LISTENING

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:58.255 region:rollup2
TO INTERSEX PATIENTS LIKE ME.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.955 region:rollup2
THOSE OPPOSING AT SEA ARE ONE

HAPPY THAT SHE HAD A SURGERY AS

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.026 region:rollup2
A YOUNG CHILD I'M GLAD THAT

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.860 region:rollup2
WORKED OUT.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.762 region:rollup2
FOR IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR MY

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.497 region:rollup2

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:12.035 region:rollup2
GENITAL SURGERY REMOVING TISSUE

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.470 region:rollup2
HOME NEVER GET BACK.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.437 region:rollup2
I'M HERE TODAY FOR THEM.

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.739 region:rollup2
I COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.873 region:rollup2
INTERSEX PERSON SO YOU WOULD SEE

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:18.175 region:rollup2
A AGE FORCED TO FIT INTO A

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.543 region:rollup2

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.911 region:rollup2

WITH SEEDS DON'T IDENTIFY AS

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:24.214 region:rollup2
GIRLS BUT THE OPPOSITION WANTS

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.882 region:rollup2
TO PRETEND THAT WE DON'T EXIST

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.017 region:rollup2
AND WHATEVER OUR GENDERS WE ALL

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:28.552 region:rollup2
DESERVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE OUR

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.953 region:rollup2
OWN CHOICES.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.733 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH ITTESTS THAT HAVE

BEEN CONDUCTED THE DAY BEFORE

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.804 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT THERE WAS NORMAL

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:22.005 region:rollup2
URINARY FUNCTION.

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:22.739 region:rollup2
EVEN OFFERED TO COMBINE THE

ANESTHETIC.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
NOW THEY ONE DISORDER KILL TWO

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:31.381 region:rollup2
BIRDS WITH ONE STONE THEY NEVER

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:35.785 region:rollup2
OPTION TO US. SEVEN I HAD TO ASK

FORCEFULLY NEUROLOGISTS ABOUT

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
THAT POSSIBILITY.

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:42.025 region:rollup2

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.326 region:rollup2
MENTION ARE DELAYING SURGERY

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:45.595 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:47.297 region:rollup2
WORTHWHILE AVENUE.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.732 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH HER URINARY FUNCTION

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.766 region:rollup2
WAS FIND EVEN ORTEZ APPROVING IT

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:51.167 region:rollup2
THE DAY BEFORE.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.737 region:rollup2
HOT HE STILL INSISTED THAT

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:55.338 region:rollup2
SURGERY WAS THE BEST OPTION.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:56.172 region:rollup2
EVEN A FEW MIGHT NEVER WANT TO

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.941 region:rollup2
VAGINAL OPENING.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
UP AND AT LEAST PROBABLY UNTIL

PUBERTY WOULD ONE BECOME

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:04.614 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.838 region:rollup2
ADONAL SURGERY.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:30.974 region:rollup2

INFECTION IN SPITE OF BEING TOLD

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.179 region:rollup2
THIS WAS AN INEVITABILITY

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:39.249 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE FUTURE HAS IN FACT

NEUROLOGISTS HAS PROVEN OVER AND

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.057 region:rollup2
OVER AGAIN THAT.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:48.958 region:rollup2
LEFT UNTREATED.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:51.127 region:rollup2
THESE GIRLS ARE NOT PRONE TO YOU

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.695 region:rollup2
TWO GUYS AND YET LOTS OF PARENTS

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.129 region:rollup2
ARE STONE OF IMPRESSION THAT

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup2
THESE ARE COMMON [inaudible]

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:59.202 region:rollup2
A IN FACT A UT I RISKY SHOWN

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:00.804 region:rollup2
ONLY TO THESE GENTLE SURGERIES

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.339 region:rollup2
SELF.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:03.340 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY AFTER THESE SURGERIES

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.240 region:rollup2
TO GROWTH TYPICALLY HAVE A

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.876 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH THE I. URINARY

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.444 region:rollup2
TRACT INFECTIONS.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.745 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION WILL TRY TO

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.946 region:rollup2
CONFUSE THE ISSUE BY POINTING

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:11.881 region:rollup2
OUT THE VERY REAL MEDICAL

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.849 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FOR MANY FAMILIES WITH

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.551 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:16.019 region:rollup2
WITH C. H. AS THIS IS SUPPOSED

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:17.787 region:rollup2
TO BE A REASON TO REJECT THE

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:20.090 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION AND AS A PARENT OF A

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:21.224 region:rollup2
US MULTI WITH CH I APPRECIATE.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.225 region:rollup2
THE DISTINCTION IN THE MEANT THE

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.193 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEDICALLY

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.928 region:rollup2
NECESSARY AND MEDICALLY

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:26.496 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY.

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.764 region:rollup2
WELL YES I TAKE MEDICATION THREE

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:29.199 region:rollup2
TIMES A DAY SHE WAS A MEDICAL

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.834 region:rollup2
ALERT BRACELET EVERYWHERE THAT

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:32.369 region:rollup2
SHE GOES WE HAVE TO CARRY AND

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:33.436 region:rollup2
MURDER YOU SEE BAG OF INJECTIONS

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:35.271 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.840 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE THAT SHE GOES.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:38.508 region:rollup2
I IN FACT JUST WE'RE IN OHIO SHE

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.176 region:rollup2
GOT SICK AND VOMITED AND WE'RE

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:41.144 region:rollup2
AT A COTTAGE.

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.545 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:44.047 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THIS MEDICATION WHERE

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.515 region:rollup2
THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL WAS SENT US

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.983 region:rollup2
INTO A FRENZY.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:49.119 region:rollup2
TURNS OUT SHE JUST IT TOO MANY

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:50.620 region:rollup2

LOT WITH KIDS WITH CA AGE TO BE

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.527 region:rollup2
VERY STRATEGIC WRAP UP.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
THE FROTHY ONLY ETHICAL CHOICE

01:04:57.527 --> 01:05:00.764 region:rollup2
WE'RE PRESENTED WITH.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:03.032 region:rollup2
THIS OPTION WAS TO LET ROSY

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:04.701 region:rollup2
DECIDE FOR HERSELF AND IT SEEMS

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:06.202 region:rollup2
TO BE THE ARE ONLY REASONABLE

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:08.071 region:rollup2
OPTION THAT WE COULD CONSIDER IF

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.606 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO MEDICALLY NECESSARY

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.940 region:rollup2
REASON FOR HER TO HAVE ANY.

01:05:09.606 --> 01:05:13.109 region:rollup2
SURGERY AND BY DEFINITION THIS

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:15.178 region:rollup2

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:56.746 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CONCERNS.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.381 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT TERMS LIKE

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.915 region:rollup2
INTERSECTS WITH HERE'S THE ARE

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.116 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY MEANT TO BE

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:03.019 region:rollup2
BROUGHT.

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:03.019 region:rollup2
BUT AS MORE INFORMATION COMES

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:05.788 region:rollup2
LITERATURE AND OTHER --

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.191 region:rollup2
LITERATURE IS A BECOMES CLEAR

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:08.591 region:rollup2
THAT SOME DIAGNOSES JUST ARE.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.360 region:rollup2
MISS --

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:14.497 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED INTO THE GORY OR IN

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.399 region:rollup2
FACT STAND ON ITS OWN --

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:17.667 region:rollup2
SHE EIGHT REPRESENTS 90% OF THE

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:20.670 region:rollup2
CASES THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:22.205 region:rollup2
SIAKA SERE ONE TEN YET THE VAST

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:23.740 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF C. H. PATIENTS.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.508 region:rollup2
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF MEDICAL

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.676 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS TO MANAGE PATIENTS

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.044 region:rollup2
WITH C. H. DON'T CONSIDER IT

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:29.312 region:rollup2
INTERSECTS.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.914 region:rollup2
BUT RATHER A METABOLIC DISORDER

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:32.081 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE ADRENAL GLAND

01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:35.018 region:rollup2
WHICH APARTMENT NATURE AND

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:36.052 region:rollup2
EARLIER --

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:37.587 region:rollup2
THE HIGH TESTOSTERONE LEVELS

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:40.757 region:rollup2
WHICH MAY ALTER THE APPEARANCE

01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:42.058 region:rollup2
OF THE GONADS IS A RISK FOR SOME

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:43.593 region:rollup2
OF THE PATIENTS HAVE C. H. BUT

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.061 region:rollup2
NOT CLEARLY ALL OF THEM.

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.662 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THE EXTERNAL

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.063 region:rollup2
GENITALIA IT THAT'S NOT IMPACT

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:49.532 region:rollup2
--

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.500 region:rollup2
THE THE INTERNAL GENITALIA SO IN

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.868 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS THERE'S NO ISSUE

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.236 region:rollup2
WITH THE OVARIES HAVE NO ISSUE

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:55.371 region:rollup2
WITH UTERUS IF LOOKING IN TOMBS

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.739 region:rollup2
TUBES THIS IS PRIMARILY AN

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:58.775 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL GENITALIA ISSUE.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:00.343 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IF DIAGNOSED EARLY

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:02.512 region:rollup2
ENOUGH IN SELECT CASES IT CAN BE

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
MANAGED AND THE EFFECTS OF THE

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:05.315 region:rollup2
TESTOSTERONE ARE NOT PRESENT AT

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.683 region:rollup2
BIRTH.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:08.685 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:10.787 region:rollup2
THE ALLEGATIONS OR POP OR ROCK

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:12.355 region:rollup2
COMMENTS STATED IN THE WHEREAS

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:14.123 region:rollup2
SECTIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:16.392 region:rollup2
REALLY REFLECT THAT AN ESTIMATE

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:17.026 region:rollup2
AND ANACHRONISTIC VIEW OF THE

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:18.695 region:rollup2
CURRENT STATE OF MEDICAL AFFAIRS

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:20.964 region:rollup2
--

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:22.999 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO WHEN WE ENCOUNTER

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:24.667 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH WITH

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:26.035 region:rollup2
THE STD OR CA H.?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.470 region:rollup2
IS VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN IT

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:29.072 region:rollup2
WAS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.973 region:rollup2
WHEN I STARTED MY PRACTICE OR

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:31.174 region:rollup2
STARTED TRAINING.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.875 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE A MULTI SPECIALTY

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:33.710 region:rollup2
TEAM.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:35.578 region:rollup2
THE TEEMING CORPORATES

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.713 region:rollup2
ADOLESCENT GYNECOLOGIST SOCIAL

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:38.481 region:rollup2

AS ENDOCRINOLOGIST IN PEDIATRIC

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:44.787 region:rollup2
UROLOGIST BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:46.322 region:rollup2
MULTITUDE OF ISSUES THAT EACH

SPECIFIC TRIAL HAS AND THEY

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:49.525 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.927 region:rollup2
IN TURN BY THOSE WHO KNOW FROM A

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:52.662 region:rollup2
MEDICAL STANDPOINT --

01:08:50.927 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
THE MOST ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:56.466 region:rollup2
ISSUES SO THAT FAMILIES HAVE

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:57.734 region:rollup2

FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.249 region:rollup2
HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.783 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.485 region:rollup2
TO THEIR PROPONENTS OF THE

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:45.054 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS AND IN FACT WHEN TALK

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:47.023 region:rollup2
TO QUITE A SEVERAL.

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:48.491 region:rollup2
UROLOGISTS AND SURGEONS NONE OF

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:49.725 region:rollup2
WHOM KNEW THAT THIS WAS

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:51.794 region:rollup2
HAPPENING BECAUSE I WANTED TO

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
BETTER UNDERSTAND CA H. THE

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.964 region:rollup2
IMPACT AND AND AND THE SPECTRUM

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.732 region:rollup2
THAT IT REPRESENTS AND FROM MY

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:58.634 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT.

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:59.402 region:rollup2
I DO UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:02.438 region:rollup2
TO THIS BUT I THINK THIS

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:04.573 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION AT THIS POINT IS.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.975 region:rollup2
IS A REASONABLY FAIR STATEMENTS

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.810 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE AT THE

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:09.445 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SOME OF THE

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:12.348 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.249 region:rollup2
IF IF THIS STATEMENT IS GOING TO

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:15.384 region:rollup2
TURN INTO POLICY FOR THE STATE

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:16.452 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:18.287 region:rollup2
SOME DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:20.056 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED LIKE.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:22.658 region:rollup2
THE AGE OF CONSENT WOULD NEED TO

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:24.193 region:rollup2
BE TALKED ABOUT THE MEDICAL

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:25.995 region:rollup2
NECESSITY AND AND SOME OF THE

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:28.397 region:rollup2
REAL DIFFERENCES.

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:30.366 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIS SPECTRUM OF OF CA H.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:32.034 region:rollup2
I SORT OF FIND WITHOUT BEING A

01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:33.002 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EXPERT AND I APPRECIATE

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.503 region:rollup2
THE TIME THAT.

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:36.305 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE PHYSICIANS HAD SPENT

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:38.674 region:rollup2
WITH ME TO TRY AND BRING ME UP

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:40.543 region:rollup2
TO SPEED ON ON SOME OF THIS IT'S

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:42.445 region:rollup2
CH IS IS REALLY A SPECTRUM THAT

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:45.281 region:rollup2
PRESENTS.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:46.849 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES.

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.317 region:rollup2
FOR EACH OF THE PATIENTS AS WELL

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.252 region:rollup2
AS THE SIGNIFICANT ADRENAL

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.887 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:53.456 region:rollup2
THERE THAT THAT DO REQUIRE SOME

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.857 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE I THINK

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:56.792 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAS THAT AS A SENATOR

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:58.060 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:15:00.629 region:rollup2
SO IT IT DEFTLY RAISES SOME

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.498 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BUT THAT THE THE

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:04.867 region:rollup2
INTENTION OF ENSURING.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.202 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDREN HAVE THE BEST

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.770 region:rollup2
DECISIONS POSSIBLE THAT THEY'RE

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:09.939 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THOSE DECISIONS THAT

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.607 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:12.908 region:rollup2
THEIR IDENTITY.

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:14.610 region:rollup2
AS THEY ARE BORN AND AS THEY

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:16.012 region:rollup2
FEEL IS REALLY WHAT I SEE ARE

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.046 region:rollup2
ONE TEN IS IS ABOUT.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:19.448 region:rollup2
AND AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:20.883 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS AND THE PROPONENTS.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:22.518 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ENDS UP SAYING PRETTY

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:25.020 region:rollup2
MUCH THE SAME THAT.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.756 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION REALLY COMES DOWN

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.224 region:rollup2
TO THE SPECIFICS OF CA H. THE

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:30.459 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM THAT IT PRESENTS AND

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:31.761 region:rollup2
THE DECISIONS THAT PARENTS AND

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:33.062 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS FACE.

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:34.430 region:rollup2
IN EFFECT NONE OF THE PHYSICIANS

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:36.599 region:rollup2
THAT I TALK.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:39.068 region:rollup2
TO WERE INCLINED IN THIS IS A

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:41.037 region:rollup2
CASE A SUBSET I WILL ADMIT AND A

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:42.071 region:rollup2
SUBSET IN SORT OF MY AREA.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.606 region:rollup2
NONE OF THEM WOULD BE INCLINED

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:44.707 region:rollup2
TO RECOMMEND SURGERY BECAUSE

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:46.575 region:rollup2
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S A

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:47.176 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT STEP NOW THAT MAY

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:48.677 region:rollup2
NOT BE THE ANSWER.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:50.146 region:rollup2
ACROSSCALIFORNIA ARE CERTAINLY

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:51.981 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:53.082 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AGAIN WORTHY OF

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:55.051 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION HERE.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:57.520 region:rollup2
BUT IT SEEMS THAT [inaudible]

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:59.722 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS ARE MORE INCLINED TO

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.091 region:rollup2
WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND IN

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:03.225 region:rollup2
TEAMS WON A CASE PRESENTS ITSELF

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.261 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:05.795 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO THE PARENT TO BE

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.263 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THOSE

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:09.465 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:12.968 region:rollup2
AND THEN HOPEFULLY GIVE THAT

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:14.937 region:rollup2
CHILD THE CHANCE TO DEVELOP. FOR

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:16.772 region:rollup2
HIS OR HERSELF AND IN THEIR OWN

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.973 region:rollup2
IDENTITY AND AND THEIR OWN

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:20.009 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES BEFORE

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:21.444 region:rollup2
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES ARE MADE

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.845 region:rollup2
AND TO ME THAT'S REALLY WHAT S.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.879 region:rollup2
YOUR ONE TEN STANDS.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:25.714 region:rollup2
FOR THIS WHY I'M SUPPORTING ITS

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:27.149 region:rollup2
ASK EVERYONE HERE TO SUPPORT IT

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
BUT WITH THE CAUTION AND AGAIN

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:30.753 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IF

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:31.954 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO MOVE TO POLICY.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:33.456 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:16:31.954 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT THAT WILL NEED TO

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
BE ANSWERED THIS IS A STATE

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:37.393 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IT IS NOT

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.227 region:rollup2
A STATEMENT OF POLICY BUT IS

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:39.161 region:rollup2
TAYLOR PLEDGES OF THE

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.629 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.931 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:43.632 region:rollup2
GET IT AS RIGHT AS WE CAN.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:47.636 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:49.572 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.872 region:rollup2
SO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:51.373 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:54.043 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible]

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:56.312 region:rollup2
ISRAEL.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:58.180 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR I DO APPRECIATE ALL

01:16:56.312 --> 01:17:00.216 region:rollup2
THAT NOT THAT YOU DID IN THIS

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:02.218 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL --

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:03.319 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE RESOLUTION IT IS

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.854 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:06.555 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:07.523 region:rollup2
THIS IS A RESOLUTION AS OPPOSED

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:09.058 region:rollup2
TO POLICY.

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:10.559 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:12.261 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT SHOULD THIS

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:13.963 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD TO POLICY THAT IT

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:15.364 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT I I I I TAKE

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.265 region:rollup2
THE THAT YOUR COMMENTS VERY

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.733 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.401 region:rollup2
AND WOULD WANT THAT TO BE

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.870 region:rollup2
INCLUDED BUT FOR TODAY I WOULD

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.403 region:rollup2
MOVE THE RESOLUTION.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.705 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:26.709 region:rollup2
MOTION.

AND THE SECOND CHIU.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.178 region:rollup2
OTHERS HAD IN ADDITION TO A

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.379 region:rollup2
SECOND IN THE MOTION THAT I

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:31.514 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:33.149 region:rollup2
I HAS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:34.850 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION THAT THIS IS REALLY

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.051 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.786 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES I THINK BOUT HAS BEEN

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:39.421 region:rollup2
A BIT OF A COMMON --

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:41.157 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THIS

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:42.725 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION IS ABOUT A AND A VERY

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.292 region:rollup2
MUCH RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE OF

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.493 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION PARTICULARLY

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:45.728 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.462 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BUT I

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:47.763 region:rollup2
THINK -- FOR

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:49.565 region:rollup2
ALL OF US FOR TALKING ABOUT A

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:51.066 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY PROCEDURE

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:52.801 region:rollup2
I KNOW THERE'S MIGHT BE SOME.

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.435 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES ON WHAT THAT ENTAILS

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.870 region:rollup2
BUT IF THAT'S WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:59.341 region:rollup2
--

01:17:54.870 --> 01:18:00.042 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF NOT ALLOWING --

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:01.777 region:rollup2
STRIKES ME AS ONE THAT WE

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:04.213 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T SUPPORT SO WITH THAT

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:06.615 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE REST OF

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:07.917 region:rollup2

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOT MISTER

COMMITTEE AND THE HAVING PER

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:20.596 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:22.064 region:rollup2
SEVERANCE APPRECIATE THAT --

I DO KNOW THAT AT THIS

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:26.936 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY MOVES OUT TO BILL

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.404 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE IN A
