FROM WHAT USED TO BE A THIRTY

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:20.319
YEAR AMORTIZATION. TO NOW A

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.954
TWENTY YEAR AMORTIZATION.

THINK ABOUT A MORTGAGE THE SAME

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:39.638
PRINCIPLE APPLIES. HERE WHEN

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:41.406
EIGHTY. WHEN IT SIX ADOPTS H.

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:43.241
PERIOD TO PAY DOWN THE UNFUNDED

WOULD DO IF YOU PICK A FIFTEEN

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:53.251
YEAR MORTGAGE VERSUS THE THIRTY

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:55.220
YEAR MORTGAGE IT ALSO MEANS THAT

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.788
CURRENT TAXPAYERS WOULD PAY MORE

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.123
TO WORK THE CURRENT UNFUNDED

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.725

TIME. WHICH MEANS HIRING TOOL

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.266
COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM. AND IN

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:10.135

WE HAD BEEN WATCHING. CLOSELY

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.610
HOW. B. AS IN OUR- WE DID SEE.

00:27:58.676 --> 00:28:00.478
INCREASED WITH AT THAT TIME OR-

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:02.147
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF SCHOOL THIS

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:04.215
. ONES REOPEN. AT THINGS THAT

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:08.253
STAY. SINCE SO FOR US I KNOW WE

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:10.188
- YOU KNOW. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

FUNDING PENSION BENEFITS IT'S

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.224
MORE ABOUT I THINK IT'S NORMAL

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.526
TO SEE- WHAT I WOULD CALL SHORT

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:16.828
TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMOGRAPHIC

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:19.664

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:27.605
TO BE STAY FOR THE LONG TERM AND

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:28.740
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.642
IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL NOW

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.143
THAT SINCE WE'RE STILL IN THE

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.446
KOBE AT THE END. BUT I THINK

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:36.448
MOST SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:38.750
MONITOR AND IF NEEDED MAKE THE

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.085
ADJUSTMENTS AND RESPONDING IN

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:43.988

HOW LONG IT WILL BE HERE IT'S

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:29.334
CERTAINLY- WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.003

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:01.052
IS. EIGHT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:02.386
CONTINUE TO RESIDE IN THE STATE

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.055
OF CALIFORNIA CLOSE 290% OF

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.624
THOSE PENSION PAYMENTS. AVERAGE

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:07.325
MONTHLY ALLOWANCE FOR ALL THE

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:08.926
TIMES AND- ITS NUMBERS

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.761
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.229
OFTEN HEAR CRITIQUES THAT NEEDS

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.565
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE MAKING A

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:15.433
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.435
RETIREMENT. AT THE AVERAGE

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:18.736
AMOUNT IS AROUND THIRTY TWO

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.571
HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND I BROUGHT

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.173
THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES INTO THAT

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.775
NUMBER IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THIS

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:25.376
ONE POINT AVERAGE THAT NUMBER

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:26.911
COMES DOWN. QUITE CONSIDERABLY.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.946
FOR ALL NEW RETIREES WHO ARE NOW

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.214
RETURNING OUT OF THE SYSTEM OF

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.416
THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THAT NUMBER

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:36.153
INCREASED TO THIRTY SEVEN NINETY

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.388
THREE AND 33% OF OUR MEMBERS.

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.489
ADDITIONAL MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:45.096
ACCESS. OR DO NOT USE SOCIAL

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.464
SECURITY. I WILL MEMBERS ARE ARE

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.800
GOING TO. APPELLATION TO BE

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:52.870
HONEST I FOUR HI AS A- JUNE

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.572
THIRTIETH OF LAST YEAR THE

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.072
BERKELEY SEVEN SEPARATE

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:56.941
INSISTING BILLION THAT NUMBER

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.309
WENT OVER THE FIVE HUNDRED

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.144
BILLION AT THE END OF THE YEAR

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.912
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IN SOME OF

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.280
THE VOLATILITY THAT WE'VE ALWAYS

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.181
BEEN SEEING AND EXPERIENCING

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.816
THAT NUMBER HAS COME BACK DOWN

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.551
AND AGAIN JUST A REMINDER OF THE

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.655
FUNDED STATUS AT 80% WHICH IS.

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:13.124
IN A BETTER PLACE CERTAINLY

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.394
NINETEEN NOT 6566% AT THAT TIME

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.862
WHAT WE'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:20.364
IS AND NOT AS WELL OKAY 50%

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:22.400
MARKER AND THAT WOULD BE VERY

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.234
DIFFICULT FOR A PUBLIC PLAN OF

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.703
OUR SIZE LIABILITIES WE HAVE TO

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.706
FULLY RECOVER FROM THAT SO AGAIN

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:29.473
ANOTHER REASON WHY THAT

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.076
PRESENTATION AT POLICY AND

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:33.210
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WERE PUT

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:35.680
IN PLACE AND THEN A TWENTY ONE

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:43.020
POINT THREE I NEVER. TURNED ON

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:43.888
ON INVESTMENTS. I'M GOING TO

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:45.623
CITE IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.291
TERM. AGAIN FOR A LONG TERM AND

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:48.259
THAT'S- A WEEK INTEND TRIPLE Y.

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:50.061
TERM. YOU OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO

00:38:50.127 --> 00:38:51.095
LITTLE BETTER I. YOU KNOW

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.596
ANALYSIS OF EACH. SHORT TERM

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:54.265
DYNAMIC OF MEETING HAPPEN IN ON

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.067
THE- BUT ESSENTIALLY OTHER THAN

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:58.202
THE- EIGHT OH NINE I PARTY INTO

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:01.806
CRISIS. EVERY TIME PERIOD SPANS

00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.574
IN EXCESS OF THE ASSUMED RATE OF

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:06.177
RETURN TODAY AT SIX POINT EIGHT.

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.779
IT WAS AT SEVEN POINT FIVE IN

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:09.346
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT HAS

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:13.718
BEEN COMING DOWN. TO WHERE IT

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.086
COUNTS SINCE ABOUT SIX POINT

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:16.320
EIGHT. I COMING TO. AN OPPORTUNE

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:19.056
ON SIX INVESTMENT RISK. YES

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.524
THERE'S A LOT OF RISK IN THE

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.093
PORTFOLIO THERE'S REALLY NOWHERE

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:24.128
TO HIDE FROM NOT TIGER WOODS NEW

RECRUIT FOR TOP TALENT. AND

THEN- EXCEPTIONAL HEALTH CARE WE

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.929

PURCHASER OF HEALTHCARE IN THE

UNITED STATES JUST UNDER FEDERAL

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.101
GOVERNMENTS WILL TALK A LITTLE

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.803
BIT ABOUT THAT. OUR STRATEGY AND

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.271
THEN OUR NEWLY RELEASED. ABOUT A

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.706
YEAR AGO WHEN WE STARTED CURSING

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:09.406
AT THE MEETING QUESTION

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.075
FRAMEWORK. WHICH REALLY IF YOU

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.943
COMPARE THAT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.944
THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.446
AROUND THE REGIONAL EQUITY

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:17.848
AUDIT. THIS WOULD GIVE YOU THAT

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.250
SAME. FROM THE SAME FRAMEWORK OR

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:21.285
THE SAME TYPES OF STRATEGIES TO

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.587
MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:24.321
THE SUPPLIER DIVERSITY IN THE

ASKED CLASS. APPROACH IN

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.527
SOMETIMES THOSE ASSET CLASSES

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:11.161
WERE COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:13.197
OR THEY WOULD CANCEL OUT A

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:14.164
STRATEGY. IT'S A REALLY PUTTING

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:16.000

MOVING OUR REAL ASSETS STRATEGY

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.025
AWAY FROM A GROWTH STRATEGY TO

MORE OF AN- INCOME BASED

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.163

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.322
PRIORITIES FOR TOP PURCHASERS

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:07.457
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. CALPERS

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.493
CALIFORNIA AND DEPARTMENT

MANAGED HEALTHCARE GAUGE I

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:13.096
SNACKS AND REALLY PROUD OF THE

WORK THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THERE

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.599
BUT WE SING ON THREE PRIMARY

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.467
CHRONIC CONDITIONS OBVIOUSLY

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.469
PHARMACEUTICALS ARE THE LARGEST

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:21.771
PART AND SEND ALONG WITH

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.006
INPATIENT. AND LOOKING FORWARD

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:25.275
TO SEEING THE OUTCOME OF THE

WORK THAT'S. BEEN HAPPENING BY

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:37.420
THIS COALITION. AND ON US. THE

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:38.989
SITE IS NOT TO TWO WHICH IS OUR

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.690
DIVERSITY AT AND FRAMEWORK AND

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.659
WE'RE QUITE PROUD OF A SPRING

WITH. KIND SUPPLIERS BUT THAT'S

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.769
AN INVESTMENT THAT'S IN TALENT

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:55.505
MANAGEMENT AND WE HIRE IN

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:56.606
NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY EIGHT

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:58.241
HUNDRED POINTS TO HAVE A CALPERS

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.477
SO IT'S ALL BASED ON OUR FIVE

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:02.512
CORE PRINCIPLES ONE WE CULTURED

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.681

DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AND WE DO

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:19.296
HAVE WAYS OF MEASURING EVERY ONE

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:21.131
OF THESE FIVE COMPONENTS AND

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:22.198
THEN ON THE TALENT MANAGEMENT

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.301
SIDE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.936
WORK HE NEEDS AND- WHAT'S THE

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:27.604
BEST ANSWER THAT'S HEALTHCARE WE

DIVERSITY. HERE IN THE STATE OF

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.352
CALIFORNIA. EXACTLY I DID ABOUT

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:44.054

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.092
EIGHT FOR PART OF THE BASE THAT

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.393
HAS SELECTED FOR OUTSIDE. THAT

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.462
WE IN THAT WE TRY TO DIVERSE

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.230
SENSE. TO CHOOSE FROM AND THEN

00:53:54.297 --> 00:53:55.165
ON INVESTMENTS HI JAMES

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.634
MENTIONED THIS THIS IS ALL ABOUT

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.335
MANAGER SELECTION. AT THE BASKET

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.136
DURING ASSETS ARE MANAGED IN

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:02.539
HOUSE AT CALPERS SO THAT TALENT

MANAGEMENT AND RECRUITMENT.

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:05.775
EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN THE WAY

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:06.943
THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUR

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.211
INVESTMENT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE-

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.112
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

DIVERSITY AT THE TABLE WHEN

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:12.882
DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AROUND

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:13.850
THE PARK. AND HE SEEMS PRETTY

. SHARE AS I UNDERSTAND THE

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.985
QUESTION AND IT WAS REGARDING

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.787
THE INVESTMENTS IN THE PORTFOLIO

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.556
AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN LOST BY

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.558
THE SYSTEM'S EITHER IN ACTUAL

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.592
INVESTMENT LOSSES OR AN

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.061
OPPORTUNITY LESSONS- EITHER

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:06.296
THROUGH SELF DIRECTED INVESTMENT

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:08.498
OR LEGISLATED TO TAP MY DECIDED

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.266
TO COMPEL THE VESTMENTS AND THE

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:12.235
MOST RECENT REPORTS ARE THAT WE

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:13.670
GET FROM BOETTCHER CONSULTANTS

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:15.472
WHO DOES THE CALCULATION ON

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.607
RECORDED THE BEST ONES IN THE

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:19.209
SUSPENSE IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:21.444
DOLLARS AND LOST LOST

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:24.581
OPPORTUNITY. OR THE COST OF THAT

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.516
ACTUALLY MEANT A LOT OF THAT

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:27.784
INCIDENT TO BACK THOSE ARE THE

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.619
VAST MAJORITY NEEDS AND TOBACCO

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:32.021
AT THIS POINT AND BUT I THINK

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.356
IT'S SAFE WITH HIM THE WHOLE

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.859
IDEA OF ENGAGEMENT OVER THE LAST

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.660
NIGHT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.829
FIRMLY BELIEVE AND NEAT WE DON'T

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.731
BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE INVESTOR

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:43.032
THE BEST IN HIS WILLINGNESS ON

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.934
THE ROOT CAUSES OF CARBON

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:47.537
EMISSIONS. IT'S GOING TO TAKE-

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.806
YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF THIS FIFTY

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.441
FIVE TRILLION KIND ACTION ONE

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:52.308
HUNDRED PLUS IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:53.409
EVERYONE DOING THIS INCLUDING

00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:56.079
GOVERNMENTS REGULATORS INVESTORS

00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:57.413
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING CALPERS

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.382
AND CAL STAR SECIAL SPEECH

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:01.084
SPEAKING FOR THEMSELVES STAND

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.219
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.121
SOLVE INDEPENDENTLY AND JUST AS

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:06.456
A REMINDER ON THE FOSSIL FUEL

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.958
SITES ON WHICH I THINK IS

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.760
SOMETHING AND THE QUESTION AS

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.729
WELL AS SAFE IF NOT 20% OF THE

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.397
PORTFOLIO IS REALLY EXPANDS

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:15.732
THERE IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:16.666
PROBLEM OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.635
EMISSIONS OR GET INTO A CARBON

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:20.770
NEUTRALITY PORTFOLIO. WHEN YOU

THINK OF OTHER SECTORS THE

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:22.972
CONSTRUCTION SECTOR THE

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.842
PACKAGING SECTOR OF THE TRAVEL

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.976
SECTOR AND YOU KNOW IF YOU

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:29.345

INTERNET SIR BY TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:40.390
WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE. COMMITTED

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:41.357
TO GET INTO THAT SORT OF I.

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:43.760
TWENTY FIFTY QUID- COMING. LOOK

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.395
YOUR ACCOUNT. AND THEN THAT'S ME

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.163
TO TAKE MORE THAN CALC SIMPLE.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.499
FROM SOME. IF YOU SOLVED ENTIRE

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:50.133
PROBLEM DIVEST FROM EVERYTHING

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.401
THAT HAS. A CARBON. THERE'S

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.369
REALLY PLACE HELP TO BE BEST FOR

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:56.272
THEM POINTS. SO AND THAT WAS ONE

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.273
OF THE- SHAREHOLDERS. I BELIEVE

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.108
J. ANSWER. OUR AN EXAMPLE A

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.243
SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY WE NEED

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.311
THAT WE HAVE SOME. SIGNIFICANT

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:02.612
IMPACT AND THAT WAS WITH OXYGEN

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:05.481
AND SAY ALSO IT'S ON SOME OF OUR

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:08.117
ENGAGEMENT AND- PROXY AND

00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:10.453
VOTING. AND WITH EXXON AND

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.788
GETTING THE CLIENTS I WILL BE

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.156
GETTING A CLIMATE SCIENTIST ON

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:15.792
THAT BOARD. AND WE FOUND THAT

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.527
MOST OF THE PUBLIC COMPANIES BUT

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.629
WE ARE ENGAGING FOR CLIMATE

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.264
ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS HAD MADE

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.166
A COMMITMENT TO CANCER. FIFTY

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:24.367
WHAT IS CHANGING TO CATEGORY

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.035
NEED THAT DATE I WOULD MORE

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.070
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THAT

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.505
EMISSION DATA SO THAT WE CAN BE

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:30.640
MORE FORCEFUL AND NAVIGATIONAL

00:58:30.707 --> 00:58:32.408
BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR HOLDING

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.043
MORE MORE ACCOUNTABLE NOT

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:34.944
ENGAGEMENT SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:37.013
WE'RE- CONTINUING TO PUSH ON THE

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.848
S. E. C. YOU KNOW WE'RE-

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.583
INVESTING LOCALLY WILL PUSH ON

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.819
THAT I. R. S. AND THAT. YOU KNOW

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:44.754
YES SHE REALLY HAS BECOME MORE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.489
AND A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.725
STRATEGY LONGER TERM ABORTING

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.793
TRYING TO. FIX IT WE CAN'T AVOID

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.263
AND SHORT TERM. ISSUES AS MUCH

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.198
AS POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY SEARCH

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:03.505
TO PUT ON THE RADAR OF- OF BOTH

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:05.941
COMMITTEES. WITH WITH TAPPARA

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.342
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:09.678
THERE A LOT OF NEW RESTRICTIONS

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.313
PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT DOUBLE

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.047
DIPPING THOSE THE CONSENT VERY

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.082
GOOD AT. POLICY REASONS BEHIND

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.250
THAT SOME OF THOSE RULES WERE

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.119
SUSPENDED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:17.986
DEAL WITH LABOR SHORTAGES

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:19.521
THEY'VE BEEN OFF AND ON OVER THE

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:22.157
LAST YEAR- AND THEY'RE NOW BEING

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:23.392
THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:26.061
REMOVED IT IS IT IS AN AREA. OF

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:27.930
INTEREST THAT WE HAVE AND I

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.331
WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.732
THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OF

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.534
THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT TAKE

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.136
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT HOW THOSE

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.505
RULES ARE WORKING AND- MAYBE A

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.840
BETTER LONG TERM A LONG TERM

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:42.044
SOLUTION. AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.045
WITH LABOR SHORTAGES. IN THE

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.514
GOVERNMENT AND- JUST REAL

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.149
BRIEFLY ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.183
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.618
LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.687
THERE WERE SOME RESTRICTIONS

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.188
WITHIN THE OPEN PUBLIC MEETING

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.690
LAWS THAT APPLY TO OUR SYSTEMS

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.692
THAT WERE LIFTED AND WHAT WE

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:59.161
FOUND MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS OF

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:00.095
SOUND IS THAT DURING THE

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.030
PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN THE

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.565
UTILIZATION OF THESE VIRTUAL

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.834
MEETING TECHNOLOGY. GREATLY

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:08.136
INCREASED ONLY OUR PUBLIC

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.538
PARTICIPATION BUT IS ALSO

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:11.874
INCREASE THE ABILITY OF OUR OWN

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.442
BOARD MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE ON

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:16.278
A REGULAR BASIS- REGARDLESS OF

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.180
WHERE THEY ARE AND SO WE JUST

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.214
WOULD ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:21.049
DEPENDENCE A NUMBER OF BILLS

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:24.119
THAT HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- THOSE

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:28.090
OPEN. PUBLIC MEETING LAWS TO

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:28.624
PERHAPS. CORPORATIONS THE

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.259
ADVANTAGES AND SOME OF THE

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.127
BENEFITS THAT THE NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.263
WILL ALLOW FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:41.436
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. IN. SO

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:42.704
IT ISSUE THAT'S UNIQUE TO THE

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.806
COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS- HAS

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:46.008
TO DO WITH US CALIFORNIA STATE

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:47.976
SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT CAME

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.411
DOWN IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:51.813
TWENTY. AND THIS WAS- IN THE

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.449
AFTERMATH OF PEPPER IN TWO

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.150
THOUSAND THIRTEEN SOME

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.885
LITIGATION THAT- THERE WAS A

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.421
THERE WAS A FOLLOW UP ON- ACROSS

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:00.389
THE STATE WITH A DIFFERENT

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:01.490
COUNTY SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.759
IMPACT- CALPERS ARE CASTERS BUT

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.027
IT'S REALLY JUST FOCUSED ON THE

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.395
COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.796
DEALING WITH WHAT SORT OF

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.731
TALENTS ARE INCLUDED AND ENGINE

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:11.300
CALCULATIONS TO UNDERGRAD-

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.368
PENSION SPIKING. THOSE CASES

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:15.170
WERE ADJUDICATED OVER OVER A

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.439
YEAR PERIOD. RULING CAME DOWN IN

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.207
THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY-

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.375
THIS AFFECTED ABOUT HALF THE

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.410
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IT'S CALLED

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:22.577
THE ALAMEDA DECISION BECAUSE

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.479
ALAMEDA WAS THE LEAD- THE

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.415
DEFENDANT. IN THAT CASE IT'S

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.417
REQUIRED A LOT OF MODIFICATIONS

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:30.152
TO PENSION CALCULATIONS-

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.486
CONTRIBUTION RESPONSE PENSION

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.522
ADJUSTMENTS ACROSS THE WHOLE

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:34.589
STATE WITH THAT WITH SEVERAL

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.825
SYSTEMS INCLUDING- MINE IN

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.294
SACRAMENTO COUNTY- ONE OF THE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.295
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.263
FOLLOWING THE LEGISLATURE

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.497
THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL BILLS HAVE

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:44.166
BEEN INTRODUCED OVER THE LAST

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.267
YEAR THAT MIGHT UNDO CERTAIN

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.268
ELEMENTS OF THAT. YOU KNOW THE

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.170
COURT RULED THAT KEPT THAT PAPER

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:49.171
WAS CONSTITUTIONAL WE ALL ARE

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:51.306
COMPLYING WITH THAT COURT

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:53.642
MANDATE TO. TO BE IN COMPLIANCE

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:56.345
WITH- FAIR UNIFORMED G.

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:57.946
CALCULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE SO

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.848
ANY ANY YOU KNOW LEGISLATION

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.483
THAT MIGHT UNDO THE COURT

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.050
DECISION IS SOMETHING WE'RE

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.118
WATCHING REALLY CLOSELY IT CAN

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:05.687
REQUIRE. SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD ON

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.322
OUR END WE'RE VERY SMALL SYSTEMS

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.890
WITH MUCH MORE STAFF TO HER

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:11.927
SISTERS HAVE- COULD RE REALLY

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:14.563
REQUIRE. A LOT OF HEADACHES MORE

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.198
LITIGATION AND WE JUST REALLY

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:22.637
LIKE TO GET. THESE ISSUES

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.505
RESOLVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.474
AS WE- MANY PARTS ARE IN GOOD

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.642
BUT INSTEAD AND YOU HATE EVEN

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.378
RECORD. THAT THERE IS PERHAPS

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:30.912
ANYTHING OTHER THAN POSITIVE

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:32.914
NEWS- FULL FUNDED STATUS. BUT

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.349
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE'VE

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.817
ALWAYS SEEN AND NOTICE AND IT'S

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:38.086
NOT JUST YOU NEED TO CARRY. IT

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.488
AROUND THE COUNTRY. OFTEN WHEN

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.056
SYSTEMS FIND THEMSELVES IN A

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:43.625
SOLID FUNDING POSITION. THERE IS

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:46.228
POTENTIALLY PRESSURE TO LOOK AT

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.530
BENEFITS FUTURE PERHAPS TRYING

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.098
TO INCREASE BENEFITS AND WE KNOW

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:52.100
WE JUST WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.935
THESE FUNDED STATUSES ARE POINTS

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:57.839
IN TIME- AND THAT. PERHAPS

01:17:57.906 --> 01:18:00.008
ADDING BENEFITS AT THE PEAK OF

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:03.078
THE MARKET- WILL CREATE DOWNSIDE

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.247
PRESSURE IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:07.082
OF FUNDING. SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:08.283
THINGS UNDERSTAND AND BE

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.119
GRATEFUL FOR- THE STATUS THAT

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.055
WE'RE IN BUT PERHAPS LOOKING AT

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:15.824
SHORING UP- FOR INSTANCE LONG

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:17.626
TERM INVESTMENT RETURN AND- THE

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.728
RISKING SOME OF OUR PORTFOLIOS.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:21.863
MIGHT BE BETTER HOUSTON'S TO

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:26.268
UTILIZE. THAT FULL FUNDING.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:29.004
REALLY LOOKING AT ENHANCEMENTS.

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.372
REAL THAT'S THE TOPIC OF THE DAY

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.174
THAT EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.675
AIR POWER AND I JERKED ABOUT

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.078
SOME ISSUES AND THIS IS A THIS

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.946
IS A REALLY INTERESTING AREA FOR

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.548
THE SMALLER COUNTY RETIREMENT

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:42.050
SYSTEMS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE-

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.919
WELL THE LEGISLATURE HAS- HAS

01:18:43.985 --> 01:18:45.387
PROVIDED DIRECTION AND THE REST

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.289
OF BILLS OVER THE YEARS THE

01:18:47.355 --> 01:18:48.657
COUNTY RETIREMENT SYSTEMS HAVE

01:18:48.723 --> 01:18:50.292
BEEN- HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FRO

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.894
THOSE AND IS REALLY A POLICY

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.129
REASON IN A PRACTICAL

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.664
ADMINISTRATIVE REASON FOR THAT.

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.966
WE DO NOT MANAGE ASSETS

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:00.035
INTERNALLY IN OUR SYSTEM SO WE

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:03.205
WERE ALL EXTERNALLY MANAGED

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.172
ASSETS. ACROSS THE TWENTY

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.907
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS AND- WHAT

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.442
THAT MEANS IS THAT WE HIRE

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:10.212
MANAGERS- AND ENTERED A LIMITED

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:12.280
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS. AND

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:14.182
LARGELY CO MINGLED FUNDS THAT WE

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.485
DON'T CONTROL- SO WE CHOOSE AND

01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:18.320
WHICH IS AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.122
HIRE A MANAGER. AND ALLOCATE

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:21.990
DOLLARS TO THAT MANAGER TO

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.892
INVEST IN OUR BEHALF. IN WHAT

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.161
THAT MEANS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.329
WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OR MUCH

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:28.630
SWAY AND WHAT THOSE WITH THOSE

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:31.233
INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ARE THOSE YOU

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.868
KNOW WE DON'T BUY INDIVIDUAL

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.503
STOCKS SO. THAT MANAGERS DOING

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:37.005
THAT ON OUR BEHALF. AND SO IF WE

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:39.007
EVER WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:19:39.074 --> 01:19:42.244
WE WERE- REQUIRED OR OR DIRECTED

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.412
TO DIVEST ROM A SPECIFIC ISSUE-

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:46.214
WE COULD POTENTIALLY REQUIRES TO

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:47.816
TERMINATE THAT MANAGER WHICH

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.251
WHICH WOULD HAVE. BEEN A

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.385
SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION COSTS

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.587
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. IN ORDER

01:19:52.654 --> 01:19:54.289
TO POSSIBLY YOU KNOW TO GET RID

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:56.958
OF A MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:57.459
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.928
INVESTMENT MIGHT COST US. FIVE

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:00.428
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.130
TRANSACTION COST ON WINE THAT

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:04.633
SO. THERE'S A VERY IN MINISTRY

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:05.834
TO PRACTICAL REASONS THAT THE

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.503
LEGISLATURE HAS- HAS HAS NOT

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.205
FOCUSED AS MUCH ON THE COUNTY

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.840
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS APPRECIATE

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:12.374
THAT DISCRETION. ENCOURAGE

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.843
LEGISLATURE TO KEEP KEEP THAT IN

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.978
MIND AS THESE ISSUES- IF YOU

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.880
NEED TO GET DISCUSSED AND

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:23.518
DEBATED. OVER THE OVER THE NEXT

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.320
YEAR. AND I THINK IT IT. YOU

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:26.788
KNOW THE ENTRANCE OF THE

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.790
QUESTIONS- CHAIR COOPER. WHEN

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.458
YOU LOOK AT HIS ERIC SAID YOU

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.194
KNOW THE BEST MEN'S HAS BEEN ONE

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.428
OF THOSE THINGS OVER THE TIME

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.764
THE BOARD SHOULD BE TAKEN

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:36.431
ACTIONS ON THEIR OWN- YOU KNOW

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.099
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T. HAVE ANY

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.802
COLLECTED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.304
THE BEST MAN ACTIONS MAY HAVE

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:43.405
OCCURRED OVER TIME POSSIBLE

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.707
IMPACT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.676
STAKEHOLDER CHANGED AGAIN WITH

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.911
TWENTY BOARDS. FOR YOU KNOW

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:26.334
PROBABLY KNOW THE FUN WAS

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.436
PROJECTED TO RUN OUT OF ASSETS

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:29.871
IN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS BUT-

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.305
BECAUSE OF OUR CULTURE SPENDING

01:28:31.372 --> 01:28:33.241
PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED IN. TWENTY

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:35.410
FOURTEEN. CASTERS AS FINANCIALLY

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.345
STRONGER AND BETTER POSITIONED

01:28:37.412 --> 01:28:39.414
TO ACHIEVE FOR FINDING. THE

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.815
FUNDING PLAN INCREASED COMP

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:43.551
CONTRIBUTIONS AMONG THE PROGRAMS

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.053
THREE COM CONTRIBUTORS CASTERS

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.088
MEMBERS EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.489
AND IN FACT CASTERS IS AHEAD OF

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.158
SCHEDULE AND ITS GOAL OF

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.427
REACHING FULL FUNDING BY TWENTY

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.327
FORTY SIX THE TARGET DATE

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:55.263
ESTABLISHED IN OUR FUNDING PLAN.

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:56.564
THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS MADE

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.199
TO THE STATE THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:28:58.266 --> 01:28:59.300
TO REDUCE ITS SHARE OF THE

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:00.768
CASTERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.503
COMBINED WITH THE TWENTY SEVEN

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:04.439
POINT 2% INVESTMENT RETURN THAT

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:06.841
WE EARNED LAST YEAR. PUT CASTERS

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:08.242
ON A PATH THAT COULD LEAD US TO

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:10.111
FULL FUNDING PRIOR TO THE TWENTY

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.412
FORTY SIX TARGET DATE. AND THE

01:29:11.479 --> 01:29:12.380
STATE COULD ACTUALLY FULLY

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.981
ELIMINATE THEIR SHARE OF THE

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:14.982
CULTURES AND FUNDED LIABILITIES

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:18.619
IN THE NEXT. TWO TO THREE YEARS.

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:19.987
THE KIOSK OF THE FUNDING PLAN IS

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:20.955
THE LIMITED RATE SETTING

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.056
AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDES THE

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.092
BOARD. TO ADJUST THE STATE AN

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:25.960
EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES AND

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.662
THIS ALLOWS CASTERS TO RESPOND

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.263
TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:30.965
BETTER POSITIONS US TO TEACHING

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.967
FOR FUNDING. BUT THERE ARE RISKS

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.569
THAT REMAIN- AS WE ARE

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:36.671
MONITORING THE FUNDING PLAN THAT

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:37.338
COULD PREVENT US FROM REACHING

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.207
THE FULL FUNDING. AND THE MOST

01:29:39.273 --> 01:29:40.208
SIGNIFICANT THREE I'M GOING TO

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.543
SPEAK ABOUT- BRIEFLY. THE FIRST

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:45.146
IS THE LONGEVITY RISK. THE CODE

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.247
NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:47.315
ALL THREE OF THE WRIST IN

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.250
DIFFERENT WAYS. AND IS LIKELY TO

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:50.518
CONTINUE TO IMPACT THESE RISKS

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.020
ON THE SHORT TERM- AS AN END AS

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.856
WELL AS A LONG TERM. THE

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.357
LONGEVITY RISK REFERS TO THE

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.925
POTENTIAL THAT MEMBERS LIVE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.460
LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED.

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.295
RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR THEIR

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:02.730
LIFETIME BENEFIT TO COVER A

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.565
LONGER PERIOD THAN EXPECTED.

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.067
LIVING LONGER FOR RETIREMENT

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.535
SYSTEM NEEDS PAINTWORK AND

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.337
BENEFITS. AND ON THAT FRONT

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:10.805
CASTERS IS UNIQUE OR TEACHERS

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:13.074
ENJOY A LONGER LIFESPAN THAN THE

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.842
AVERAGE PERSON IN CALIFORNIA.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.310
AND IN THE UNITED STATES. A

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.412
FEMALE CASTERS TEACHER LIVES ON

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.981
AVERAGE TWO TO THREE YEARS

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:21.849
LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE WOMAN

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.584
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND FIVE TO

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:24.719
SIX YEARS LONGER. THAN THE

01:30:24.786 --> 01:30:27.221
AVERAGE U. S. WOMAN. AND WITH

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:28.589
72% OF OUR CAL STIRS MEMBERS

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:30.458
BEING WOMEN. THIS LONGEVITY

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.026
CORRELATES WITH THE MAJORITY F

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.095
OUR MEMBER POPULATION. JUST TO

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:35.496
PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE WE

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:37.031
CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.432
TEN MEMBERS THAT ARE OVER THE

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.101
AGE OF ONE HUNDRED. IN OUR

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:42.303
SYSTEM WITH OUR OLDEST RETIRING

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:44.005
BEING ONE HUNDRED NINE YEARS OF

01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.106
AGE SO YOU CAN SEE THE

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:47.775
SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE THAT

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:48.309
THERE FOR NOW. FINANCIAL

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:49.710
SECURITY. AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.746
FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN A FINANCIAL

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:54.015
SECURITY- IS CORE TO WHAT WE DO.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.316
THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC ADDS

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.751
EXTRA CERTAINTY TELSTRA'S

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:57.952
PROJECTIONS OF THE LIFE

01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:58.986
EXPECTANCY AND IT'S REALLY NOT

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.855
CLEAR WHETHER. THE PANDEMIC WILL

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.523
HAVE LONG TERM OR SHORT TERM

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.959
IMPACTS ON MORTALITY. AND REALLY

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.527
NOT KNOW THIS FOR THE- NEXT

01:31:06.594 --> 01:31:08.462
SEVERAL YEARS. BUT SINCE THE

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:09.497
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.033
CASTERS IS ALSO SEEN A DECLINE.

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:13.701
OF MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND AND

01:31:13.768 --> 01:31:15.403
THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE MEMBERS WHO

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:20.174
PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFINED.

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.075
BENEFIT PROGRAM. THIS WOULD N.

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.276
AS IN. INACTIVE MEMBERS HAS BEEN

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.078
. TO LOWER. EXPECTED GROWTH RATE

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.246
OVER THE- TWO YEARS AND THIS

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.614
ISN'T UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WE'RE

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.850
SEEING THIS- ACROSS THE NATION

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:31.252
THAT THE- THAT THE PAYROLL

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.921
GROWTH AND- ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.489
THE TEACHER POPULATION IS

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:37.491
CONTINUING TO DECLINE. ALSO

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:39.427
CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE IN

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:40.194
ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP WITH A HIGHER

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:43.764
THAN EXPECTED RETIREMENTS IN THE

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:44.398
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:46.267
FISCAL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY RECENT

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.134
DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.836
CHILDREN ENROLLED IN THE CATER

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:50.872
TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AS WELL

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.640
AS THE PROJECTED DECLINE IN

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:55.042
FUTURE MOMENTS MAY RESULT IN A

01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:57.078
NEED FOR FEWER TEACHERS IN

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:57.645
CALIFORNIA. AND THIS COULD

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.013
FURTHER IMPACT THE NUMBER OF

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.081
ACTIVE TEACHES TO PARTICIPATE

01:32:00.147 --> 01:32:02.016
IN THE DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.651
SO THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:05.486
RELATED TO THE LONG TERM PAIN OR

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.622
DYSFUNCTION OF THREE AND A HALF

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:08.756
PERCENT THAT IS USED IN THE

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:10.625
FUNDING OF THE SYSTEM. THE RULES

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.860
OF THE FUNNY PLAN AS WELL AS

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:13.494
THESE ISSUES AFFECTING PAYROLL

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:14.629
GROWTH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:17.164
HOUSES ABILITY TO FOR FINDING

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:18.399
ADULTS REQUIRING CONTRIBUTION

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.401
RATE INCREASES ESPECIALLY. FOR

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.403
OUR EMPLOYERS. BUT OF ALL THE

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.838
RISKS PASTORS MONITORS

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:25.339
INVESTMENT RELATED VOLATILITY

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:27.375
REMAINS THE GREATEST RISK FACING

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:28.576
CONCERTS TODAY AND THIS IS

01:32:28.643 --> 01:32:30.378
IMPORTANT BECAUSE- JUST TO

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:31.979
REITERATE WHAT DAVID LAMB OR-

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.948
HAD MENTIONED ABOUT SIXTY CENTS

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.751
COME. OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:37.485
PAY COMES FROM INVESTMENT

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.921
INCOME. AND THE COMBINATION OF

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.689
CASTERS BEING A MATURE SYSTEM

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:44.358
EVER CREATED IN NINETEEN

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.393
THIRTEEN AND THE DECREASING TIME

01:32:45.459 --> 01:32:46.994
FRAME OF THE FUNDING PLAN ONLY

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.729
SERVES TO EXASPERATED STRESS.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.097
AND WHEN INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:51.866
BELOW EXPECTATIONS THE UNFUNDED

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:54.035
ACTUARIAL OBLIGATION INCREASES

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:55.269
WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:56.537
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:59.106
BRIDGE. THE GAP. BUT AS I

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.841
MENTIONED EARLIER LAST YEAR IS

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.176
TWENTY SEVEN POINT 2% INVESTMENT

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.477
RETURN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.146
THE OUTLOOK FOR FUNDING LEVELS

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:06.314
IN THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATES

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.482
AND- REALLY ASSUMING THAT- THE

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:10.217
FUND EARNED 7% OVER THE NEXT TWO

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:11.919
YEARS. THE STATE SHARE THE

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:13.754
UNFUNDED OBLIGATION IS NOW

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:20.428
PROJECTED. TO BE ELIMINATED BY

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:20.995
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ANOTHER

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.263
PART TOOL IN MY- THE PLAY ISN'T

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.332
SHE THE AXE. SOME THAT WE USE

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:26.033
OUR A PROBE WORKFLOW EXPO. OF

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.234
THE FUTURE. AND EVERY FOUR YEARS

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.369
PASTORS PERFORMS A FORMAL

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.403
REVIEW. OF OUR ACTUARIAL

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.138
ASSUMPTIONS AND THIS REVIEW WAS

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:32.273
DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.108
REVIEW OF OUR ASSET ALLOCATION.

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.509
WHICH IS HOW WE INVEST OUR

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:36.877
ASSETS AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:39.013
THAT WE RECEIVE. THIS IS ONE OF

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.648
THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS.

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.683
THAT ARE MORE TAKES ON EVERY

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.352
FOUR YEARS AND DIRECTLY IMPACTS

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:45.953
THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT RETURN

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.288
TURN ASSUMPTION ARE CURRENTLY

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.390
SET AT SEVEN PERCENT. THE BOARD

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.092
LAST REVIEW THE ADOPTION AND

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.426
ADOPTED THE ASTROS SOME SINCE

01:33:52.493 --> 01:33:54.295
LAST JANUARY. JANUARY TWENTY

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:56.430
TWENTY. AND THE NEXT REVIEW

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:58.132
CYCLES OF WILL BEGIN NEXT FISCAL

01:33:58.199 --> 01:33:59.967
YEAR TAKES APPROXIMATELY A YEAR

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:01.569
TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS. I

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:03.504
ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE OF

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:04.739
THE- SPECIFIC ECONOMIC

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:06.073
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FUNDING

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.775
OF CASTERS DEFINED BENEFIT.

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:09.243
PROGRAM AND THAT'S INFLATION AND

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.245
THAT WAS ONE OF THEM. COMMENTS

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.380
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER IN

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.248
THE- HEARING TODAY IT'S AN

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.383
IMPORTANT SOMETHING THAT

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:17.785
IMPACTS- EXPECTED PAPER WORKS.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.553
AND THE INCIDENT INVESTMENT

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.288
RETURN AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CAN

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:22.590
IMPACT OUR MEMBERS NEGATIVE

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:24.492
NEGATIVELY WE ALL KNOW INFLATION

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.460
HAS REALLY BEEN HI THIS LAST

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.029
YEAR IT'S MATTER OF FACT EVEN.

01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:29.163
HAD MENTIONED THAT IT'S THE

DIVERSIFICATION DIVERSIFICATION

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:13.167
IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:15.035
PRINCIPLE FOR MITIGATING RISK AS

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:16.504
AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR AND

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.506
INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS WERE

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS- ASSETS AND

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:25.179
DIVERSIFIED ACROSS COUNTRY- AND

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:27.047
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:27.715
DIVERSIFICATION ACTUALLY IS IN

01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:29.850
THE STATE CONSTITUTION IS A

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:30.317

TODAY- WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:41.395
TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT CAL STIRS

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:45.599

01:36:45.666 --> 01:36:47.601
TIMES OVER THE LAST TWENTY TWO

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:50.037
YEARS- I'M KIND OF SAD TO SAY

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:51.739
WERE PROBABLY THE MOST MORE THAN

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.841
ANY OTHER PLAN IN THE COUNTRY.

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.043
OF ALL THOSE TO VESTMENTS EACH

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.679
ONE OF THEM TO DATE HAS LOST

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:01.115
MONEY- TO ANSWER- CINDER

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:03.317
COOPER'S QUESTION WERE AT NINE

POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:37:06.053 --> 01:37:08.389
LOST AN OPPORTUNITY LOST A LOT

01:37:08.455 --> 01:37:10.991
OF THAT IS THE COMPOUNDING- AND

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:13.961
AS- MARCY FROST SAID DID A LOT

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:17.831
OF IT IS DUE TO TOBACCO- IF YOU.

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.567
ADDED THAT BACK IN OUR PLAN

01:37:19.633 --> 01:37:22.102
WOULD BE THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.638
HIGHER IN OUR FUNDING PLAN- AND

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.073
WE'D BE A LOT QUICKER TO BEING

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.108
FULLY FUNDED PUBLIC UP CUT A

01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:29.977
COUPLE YEARS OFF OUR PLAN TO BE

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:32.346
FULLY FUNDED- NOW A COUPLE OF

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.515
SUGGESTIONS MAY FINALLY TURN

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:37.952
EVEN- BUT IT'S SAD TO SAY- AND I

01:37:38.018 --> 01:37:39.420
CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSONAL

01:37:39.486 --> 01:37:41.188
HISTORY ADMINISTERS FOR THOSE

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.823
TWENTY TWO YEARS. NONE OF THEM

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:44.291
HAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT ABOUT ANY

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.693
SOCIAL CHANGE THEY'VE ALL BEEN

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.861
FOREIGN INVESTMENT DECISION TO

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:49.863
TRY TO MITIGATE RISKS AND SINCE

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.398
WE'VE LOST MONEY TODAY THEY

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:57.171
HAVEN'T HELPED US MITIGATE. RISK

01:37:57.238 --> 01:37:59.006
BUT WE KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE.

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:00.474
WITH THE DIVEST THOUGH AND I AND

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:02.610
I GUESS I WOULD ADD. IF YOU

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:04.812
THOUGHT OF A SINGLE WORD WHEN

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:05.479
YOU HEAR THE WORD DIVEST MEANT

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:07.114
THINK OF THE WORD AS

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.182
DISENGAGEMENT IT CAUSES US TO

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.917
TURN OUR BACK TO A PROBLEM OR

01:38:09.984 --> 01:38:11.151
IGNORE PROBLEM AND I KNOW THE

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.419
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PUT OUT

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.755
STRONG STATEMENTS- BUT I AGREE

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.257
WITH THE OTHER STATEMENTS ABOUT

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:17.625
ALLOWING THE BOARD TO MAINTAIN

01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:19.560
THEIR FIDUCIARY ARREST. WE ALL

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:21.895
CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:23.731

ENGAGEMENT- WE SOLD MANY OF OUR

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:34.041
INVESTMENTS- IN RUSSIA AS THIS

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:36.010
HORRIBLE WAR BROKE OUT. TO

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.279
MITIGATE OUR RISK- UNDER TWENTY

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:40.547
ONE RISK FACTORS- SO WE WILL

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.516
TAKE ACTIONS IN OUR PORTFOLIO-

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:46.487

AND YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S NOT

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:05.372
BLACK AND WHITE SO EVERYTHING

COMES WITH SHADES OF GREY ABOUT

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:08.642
RISK. AND WHETHER ONE RISK IS

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:11.078

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:29.683
INTENSITY. AND WE WILL PLEDGE ON

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:31.985
WHERE WE WANT TO BE OUR GOAL FOR

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:33.253
WHAT WE WANT TO BE AND REDUCING

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.888
OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY TWENTY

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.357
THIRTY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:39.993
TWENTY FORTY. BUT WE CAN'T DO IT

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.462
ALONE. DIVESTITURE OF CARBON

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:43.564
WOULD JUST CHANGE OUR PORTFOLIO

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.365
BUT WE NEED MANKIND WE NEED

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:47.935
EVERYBODY. TOGETHER ON THIS TO

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.903
CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ORDER

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:52.306
TO ROUTE SCREEN OUT PASSES. AND

01:41:52.372 --> 01:41:53.740
ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS WAS YOU

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.609
KNOW IS IT IN INDUSTRY IS JUST

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:58.412
ONE INDUSTRY THE PROBLEM. AS

01:41:58.479 --> 01:41:59.379
MARCY SAID THE ANSWERS NOW.

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:01.148
GREENHOUSE GASES ARE EVERYWHERE

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:03.383
AND IN EVERYTHING. IT STARTS

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:05.486
WITH ELECTRICITY TRANSPORTATION

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:06.887
WHICH EVERYBODY THINKS OF

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:07.721
BECAUSE AUTOMOBILES IN

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.623
CALIFORNIA. BUT IT'S ALSO IN

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:12.226
AGRICULTURE WHICH IS GOING TO BE

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:14.394
A HUGE ISSUE IN OUR STATE. IS IN

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:15.696
MANUFACTURING- IT'S IN REAL

01:42:15.762 --> 01:42:18.932
ESTATE AS MARTY MENTIONED SO. WE

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:20.334
NEED TO WORK COMPREHENSIVELY

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.536
ACROSS ALL THOSE AREAS NOT JUST

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.738
ONE AREA AND NOT VILLAIN EYES

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.340
ONE INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT'S GONNA

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.609
JUST CREATE A WAR BACK AND

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:29.810
FORTH. WHERE WE GET VERY LITTLE

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:32.079
DONE. OUR OTHER STEWARDSHIP

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:34.348
PRINCIPLES- BECAUSE- CENTER FOR

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:36.183
ASK ABOUT THOSE. WE'RE WORKING

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:37.551
ON CORPORATE MARKET

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:38.919
ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS REALLY

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.220
ABOUT MARKET AND CORPORATE

01:42:40.287 --> 01:42:42.856
DISCLOSURE CORPORATE CEO PAY AND

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.491
DISCLOSURE ON THAT. WE ARE

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:45.993
WORKING ON EFFECTIVE CORPORATE

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:47.995
BOARDS PUSHING FOR DIVERSITY ON

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:50.264
THEIR BOARDS- AND TURNOVER ON

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.499
BOARDS. WE'RE WORKING ON HUMAN

01:42:52.566 --> 01:42:54.501
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WHICH IS

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:56.370
REALLY A NICE WAY OF SAYING THE

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:57.237
WORK FORCE GETTING BETTER

01:42:57.304 --> 01:42:58.705
REPRESENTATION IN THE WORKFORCE

01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:00.407
BETTER DIVERSITY OF THE

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.376
WORKFORCE OF WORKER RIGHTS. AND

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:04.111
WE ALSO WORK VERY HARD ON THE

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:06.346
LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND TRYING TO

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:08.248
GET COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THAT

01:43:08.315 --> 01:43:11.351
PLAN. AND BEGIN A TRANSITION TO

01:43:11.418 --> 01:43:13.220
THAT. LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:15.055
LASTLY IT OUR PHONE WE PREDICT

01:43:15.122 --> 01:43:16.990
WE CARE ABOUT FIREARMS SO WE'VE

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.859
ACTUALLY BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.694
CREATING A SET OF FIRE ON

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:22.362
PRINCIPLES. AND REALLY TRYING TO

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:23.964
PROMULGATE THOSE NOT THE FIREARM

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:25.666
COMPANIES BECAUSE WE INVESTED OF

01:43:25.732 --> 01:43:27.100
THOSE SO THEY WON'T TALK TO US

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:29.303
WE CAN'T TALK TO THEM BUT TO

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:30.737
RETAILERS. FINANCE COMPANIES

01:43:30.804 --> 01:43:34.341
EVEN SHIPPERS. TO REALLY TRYING

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.043
GET SOME BETTER RESPONSIBILITY.

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:38.645
IN THE FIREARM INDUSTRY. TWO

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:39.246
OTHER THINGS I JUST WANT TO

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:41.348

OF WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUSINESS

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.021
DIFFERENTLY WE'RE TRYING TO GET

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:49.489
OUT OF SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.758

MANAGERS- I CAN TELL YOU

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:55.162
HONESTLY THAT I THINK WITHIN

FIVE YEARS WILL PROBABLY SAVE

01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:59.066
CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:43:59.132 --> 01:44:00.834

WORLD I TRY TO BE A VOICE OF

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.213
WHAT DIVERSITY MEANS. FROM THE

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:49.116
CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE- BUT ALSO

01:54:57.790 --> 01:55:00.093
THESE ISSUES NOT EVERY YOU WOULD

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:01.461
NO LONGER DEAL WITH

01:55:01.527 --> 01:55:02.328
DISINVESTMENT CENTER CASE OF

01:55:02.395 --> 01:55:04.631
FIRST IMPRESSION AS A LAWYER YOU

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.799
MIGHT REFER TO IT AS- WE'VE

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:08.334
WE'VE SEEN A SERIES OF THEM THEY

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:09.535
HAVE A CERTAIN. TYPE OF

01:55:09.602 --> 01:55:11.070
CONSEQUENCE AND I THINK WE NEED

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:14.307
TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT SO- HAS

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:15.942
THERE EVER BEEN A DISTANT A

01:55:16.009 --> 01:55:17.577
DISINVESTMENT TYPE OF PROGRAM

01:55:17.644 --> 01:55:21.314
THAT HAS RESULTED IN. A SENSE OF

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:24.550
GAIN TO THE SYSTEM. THANK YOUR

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:26.152
PRESENT A PROOF CENTER CALLING

01:55:26.219 --> 01:55:27.920
FOR THAT QUESTION- AND I WANT TO

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.323
CORRECT I IF I MISSPOKE- WE

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:31.958
DIVEST AND WE'VE DIVESTITURE

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:34.794
GAINS IN THE LAST TWENTY TWO

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:37.797
YEARS- YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOME

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:39.532
OF THOSE MIGHT BE A BREAK EVEN

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:42.035
WITH THE BEST OF COAL. BOTH US

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:44.904
AND NON US- WE THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:47.173
A VERY SOLID DECISION- BUT

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.475
UNFORTUNATELY- THE PASS TO

01:55:49.542 --> 01:55:51.277
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:54.180
CAME ALONG AND- COLE JUMPED. IN

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:58.184
USE- AND IT IT IS PROBABLY THE

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:01.254
CLOSEST ONE OF THE- SIX THEY

01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:03.423
WOULD GO TO- BREAK EVEN- THE

01:56:03.489 --> 01:56:05.491
OTHER THAT WE THOUGHT MADE SENSE

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:08.227
WAS- WE DIVEST OF FIREARMS-

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:10.596
COMPANIES THAT SELL PARTS. THAT

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:12.498
ARE ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:13.766
CALIFORNIA IT WAS ONLY TWO

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:16.135
STOCKS- BUT THERE AGAIN-

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:17.670
UNFORTUNATELY BEEN SALES WENT

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:19.939
THROUGH THE ROUGH- IN DURING THE

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:21.841
PANDEMIC. AND THEN LASTLY

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:23.376
ANOTHER ONE I WOULD SAY THAT WAS

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.078
PROBABLY OUR LAST INVESTMENT IF

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:26.979
I RECALL CORRECTLY- WE

01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:28.348
DIVESTITURE OF TWO PRIVATE

01:56:28.414 --> 01:56:31.784
PRISON COMPANIES- AND- WHILE

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.986
THERE WAS A BIG PUSH TO STOP

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:35.922
DOING BUSINESS- PEOPLE HAVEN'T-

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:38.791
AND THOSE STOCKS- UNFORTUNATELY

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:40.326
YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE MARKETS

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:43.129
ARE SO STRONG- A RISING TIDE

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:44.597
RAISES ALL BOATS EVEN ONES THAT

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:46.399
MIGHT BE WEAK LIKE THOSE STOCKS

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:49.402
AND THEY WENT UP IN VALUE. SO

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:51.537
THERE ARE LEAST OF THOSE THREE

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:53.573
OF THE SIX I WOULD SAY OUR BREAK

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:54.974
EVEN THE CHALLENGE I GUESS I

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:56.209
WOULD RACE TO YOU IS THAT I

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.177
THINK WE WHEN YOU WANT US TO

01:56:58.244 --> 01:57:00.446
TAKE ACTION. AND DIVEST MANY OF

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:02.014
THOSE DO NOT HAVE A SUNSET

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:04.083
CLAUSE AND SO ON PARTICULARLY ON

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:07.186
IRAN AND SUDAN SUDAN DID START

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.187
TO GET BETTER AND AT LEAST

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:10.156
SEPARATED. BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:12.125
INVESTED BACK IN COMPANIES THAT

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:13.359
WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH SOUTH

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:16.129
SUDAN BECAUSE THE LOG SYSTEM SO.

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:17.964
IT'S A TOUGH INSTRUMENT IT'S A

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.966
HARD DEBATE I DID IT AND THEN-

01:57:34.347 --> 01:57:36.616

THINK THIS IS NECESSARILY- AN

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:28.381
ALTERNATIVE POINT OF VIEW BUT I

02:01:28.447 --> 02:01:31.050
THINK WHAT. IS GOING ON WILL

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.251
CONTINUE GOING THE LEGISLATURE

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:34.787
IS- THERE'S A COST IS THE COST

BENEFIT ANALYSIS BUT IT'S NOT

02:01:36.656 --> 02:01:39.525
NECESSARILY WHETHER OR NOT- IN

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:41.394
THE CASE OF CLIMATE FOR EXAMPLE

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.295
LET ME JUST SAY. I HAVEN'T TAKEN

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:44.597
A POSITION ON CURRENT

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:46.332
LEGISLATION ON THE INVESTMENT

02:01:46.399 --> 02:01:49.168
AROUND CLIMATE BUT- WHEN ON THE

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:51.137
DAY THAT I WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:53.839
ALONG WITH- MY VICE CHAIR OF

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:54.840
THIS COMMITTEE DECEMBER SEVENTH

02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:57.276
TWENTY TWENTY- IT WAS ANNOUNCED

02:01:57.343 --> 02:01:59.712
THAT DAY THAT CALIFORNIA.

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:02.615
ECONOMIC DAMAGE TO TWO.

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:05.084
WILDFIRES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:06.686
A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POINT

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:11.090
FIVE BILLION- IN- JUST. A

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:14.694
RECENTLY. NATIONAL ESTIMATES ON

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.762
FIRE DAMAGE FOR TWENTY TWENTY

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:18.931
ONE OR SEVENTY BILLION. MORE

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:20.633
THAN HALF OF WHICH ABOUT FORTY

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:22.601
FIVE BILLION WAS IN CALIFORNIA

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:24.637
AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT HAPPENS

02:02:24.704 --> 02:02:25.705
IS PEOPLE AREN'T NECESSARILY

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:28.808
LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT- THE

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.943
DIVESTMENT HAS EFFECTUATED

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:33.412
CHANGE WITHIN. WITHIN THE

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:35.748
RETIREMENT SYSTEM ITSELF- OR

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:40.419
WHETHER THAT HAS. LED TO- GLOBAL

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:42.588
CHANGE BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENS

02:02:42.655 --> 02:02:44.924
IS WE HAVE NOT ONLY

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:46.158
CONSTITUENCIES BUT A SENSE OF

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:48.194
VALUES TAT SAYS WE NEED TO DO

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.229
SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE WE NEED

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:52.932
TO DO WHAT WE CAN ABOUT CLIMATE.

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:53.833
IT'S EXISTENTIAL AND THE COST TO

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:56.602
THE STATE OF DOING. NOTHING

02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:59.572
WOULD BE IN THIS CASE. IN IN THE

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:01.407
WORST YEAR WE HAD A HUNDRED

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.508
ALMOST A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION

02:03:02.575 --> 02:03:05.711
DOLLARS SO I GUESS THE QUESTION

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:07.346
THAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT FOR ME.

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:09.215
IT IS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS IT SEEMS

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.783
THERE'S TWO WAYS FOR THE PENSION

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:14.120
FUNDS TO HANDLE THESE QUESTIONS-

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:17.957
HE ONE IS. TO SAY WE'RE JUST YOU

02:03:18.023 --> 02:03:19.592
KNOW WE'RE GOING TO OPPOSE.

02:03:19.658 --> 02:03:21.660
DIVESTMENT BILLS ARE GONNA TRY

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:23.462
TO TALK PEOPLE DOWN FROM FROM

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:25.331
THE CLIFF SO TO SPEAK ANOTHER

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.299
WAY IS TO SIT IN A MAYBE AND

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:29.635
MAYBE THIS IS BOTH HAND IS TO

02:03:29.702 --> 02:03:32.238
SAY. WE ANTICIPATE EITHER BY

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:33.873
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE OR BY

02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:36.108
ATTRITION- THAT THE FOSSIL FUEL

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:38.144
INDUSTRY IS GOING TO DECLINE OR

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:39.445
THAT OUR ABILITY TO INVEST IN

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:41.280
HOUSTON GOING TO DECLINE AND

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:42.248
WHAT IS THAT CRITICAL PATH LOOK

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:44.083
LIKE I DON'T THINK I'VE YET

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.985
HEARD TODAY ANYONE COME FORWARD

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:48.654
AND SAY- WE'RE NOT PARTICULARLY

02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:50.389
KEEN ON DIVESTMENT. IMMEDIATE

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:52.358
DIVESTMENT WE DON'T THINK IT'S

02:03:52.424 --> 02:03:53.826
PRACTICAL WE DON'T THINK IT'S

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:55.127
EFFECTIVE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.095
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO GET OUT

02:03:56.162 --> 02:03:58.397
OF THIS BUSINESS AND HERE'S

02:03:58.464 --> 02:04:00.266
HERE'S HERE'S- HOW WE CAN DO

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:01.901
THAT. HERE'S A CRITICAL PATH

02:04:01.967 --> 02:04:03.836
IT'S TEN YEARS OF DECLINE

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.272
INVESTMENT IN THIS SPACE OR IT'S

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:08.741
TWENTY YEARS- I'M NOT HEARING

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.910
THAT AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK.

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.645
EITHER OF OUR CURRENT PRESENTERS

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:13.979
WHETHER OR NOT THAT KIND OF WORK

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:17.049
IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE INDIA

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:19.051
HAVE. CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:21.520
MOVING OUT OF. INVESTMENTS THAT

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:23.656
ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COSTLY

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:27.326
FOR SOCIETY. HE RESPECTABLE WHAT

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:32.998
THE LEGISLATURE DOES. I'LL JUMP

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:34.900
IN AND TURN IT OVER TO CALPERS

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:41.140
AFTER THAT THAT'S RIGHT. THANK.

02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:43.075
I'LL GO AHEAD MY NAME IS CHRIS

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:45.444
HIM AGAIN- ABSOLUTELY SIR WE'RE

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:47.513
VERY ACTIVE BOTH WE AND HERS ARE

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.615
ACTIVE IN TRYING TO GET OUR

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:50.983
PORTFOLIOS TO NET ZERO WHAT THAT

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:52.651
MEANS IS NOT JUST GETTING FOSSIL

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:54.820
FUEL COMPANIES TO STOP DRILLING

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:56.989
FOR OIL BUT TO GET THEM TO

02:04:57.056 --> 02:04:58.057
CHANGE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

02:04:58.123 --> 02:05:00.559
AN EASY TRANSITION I AGREE WITH

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:02.027
SENATOR COOPER'S COMMENTS ABOUT

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:03.429
THE PRICE OF AUTOMOBILES BUT AS

02:05:03.495 --> 02:05:05.865
I SAID IT'S EVERYWHERE SO WE

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:07.266
WANT TO REDUCE THE CARBON

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.735
INTENSITY OF OUR TWO PORTFOLIOS

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:11.904
STEADILY OVER TIME BUT A BIG

02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:13.405
PART OF THAT IS TO GET FORD AND

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:16.141
GM TO MAKE MORE EASY. IS TO GET

02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:17.109
ALL THE ELECTRICITY

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:19.111
MANUFACTURERS ARE PROBABLY THE

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:20.713
ELECTRICITY GENERATORS AND

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:22.781
UTILITIES IN THE COUNTRY TO

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.817
SHIFT AWAY FROM COAL AND FROM

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:28.487
OIL AND GAS- AND GO TO HYDROGEN

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:30.556
AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES BUT

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:31.657
THAT CAN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:34.360
BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EXPENSIVE

02:05:34.426 --> 02:05:35.961
IT'S GOT TO BE A STEADY

02:05:36.028 --> 02:05:37.263
TRANSITION- AND WE FRANKLY I'VE

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:39.698
GOT TO GET THE OIL AND GAS

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:40.332
INDUSTRY AND THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:42.668
COUNTRY OF TEXAS TO BE WILLING

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:44.303
TO SHIFT AWAY FROM WHAT'S BEEN

02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:46.338
THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER OVER TO

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:47.806
OTHER AREAS AND IT'S HARD TO

02:05:47.873 --> 02:05:49.909
TURN A BIG SHIP LIKE EXXON MOBIL

02:05:49.975 --> 02:05:51.644
BUT WE DID IT BY CHANGING THE

02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:53.879
TOP. AND GETTING THEM TO START

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:57.082
TALKING ABOUT NET ZERO IN TWENTY

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.284
FIFTY THEY'RE NOT MAKING PLANS

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.252
FAST ENOUGH GRANTED BUT THEY ARE

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:01.654
MAKING A CHANGE LOOK AT WHAT

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:04.256
SHELL CHEVRON IS DOING IN TRYING

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:07.660
TO BUY INTO A GREEN DIESEL SO

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:08.994
PEOPLE REALIZE AND THESE

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.462
COMPANIES REALIZE IF THEY WANT

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.264
TO SURVIVE IN THE FUTURE THEY'VE

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.899
GOT TO CHANGE IF THEY DON'T

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:16.568
CHANGE YES HER SISTERS WILL BE

02:06:16.635 --> 02:06:18.370
COMPELLED TO HAVE TO SELL THOSE

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:20.572
STOCKS IF WE WANT TO REDUCE OUR

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:25.110
CARBON FOOTPRINT. BUT THAT'S

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.146
GOING TO ENTAIL A RISK. IF THE

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.948
REST OF THE HAS SHIFTED. AND WE

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.316
ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE ARE

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:32.351
LIVING CLOSER TO NET ZERO. THEY

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:33.953
WERE TAKING WHO DRESSED AND

02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:35.754
WE'RE PREDICTING THE FUTURE. AND

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:37.823
THAT INVOLVES A CHALLENGE. SO

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.625
THAT'S PROBABLY TWENTY THIRTY

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:42.061
AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE NOT TODAY

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:43.162
BUT YOU HAVE TO START ON THAT

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:45.197
TRIP TODAY IF YOU WANT TO GET TO

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:47.366
ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY OR EARLIER.

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:50.069
IT'S GOT TO BEGIN TODAY. YEAH I

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:51.070
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:53.138
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT- AND I

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:55.007
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.842
WHO FEEL THAT IF YOU DON'T GET

02:06:56.909 --> 02:06:59.411
TO KNOW ZERO. AND DON'T MEAN YOU

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:01.146
WE- BUT THAT TIME FRAME. YOU'RE

02:07:01.213 --> 02:07:02.514
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAVE TO

02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:04.249
WORRY ABOUT THE PENSION FUND

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:06.118
BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE OF. OF

02:07:06.185 --> 02:07:08.220
HUMANITY SURVIVING BUT BE THAT

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:10.789
AS IT MAY ALL I WAS ASKING FOR

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:13.225
IS WHERE'S YOUR- THIRTY YEAR

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:15.160
PLAN YOUR TWENTY YEAR PLAN WERE.

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:16.795
THERE'S BILLS LEGISLATION

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:19.832
THERE'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO WRAP

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:22.735
UP THE EV'S. TO TOLD EMANATE-

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:25.170
THE SALE OF GAS POWERED VEHICLES

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:27.006
HERE LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:28.140
THAT ACTUALLY GOT SIGNED INTO

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:30.109
LAW THE ELIMINATING- GASPAR

02:07:30.175 --> 02:07:31.610
GARDEN TOOLS WITH YOU AGREE WITH

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:33.212
THAT OR NOT I'M NOT EVEN ASKING

02:07:33.278 --> 02:07:35.714
A QUESTION. OR THE AGREE WITH

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:36.815
WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIA ITSELF

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:39.151
CAN. CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:41.286
DOING THOSE THINGS- WHAT IS YOUR

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:43.989
PLAN DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE- AN

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.258
ACTUAL RAMP DOWN PLAN IT SOUNDS

02:07:46.325 --> 02:07:47.960
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. YOU

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.595
KNOW THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:50.662
INVESTING IN ARE MOVING QUICKLY

02:07:50.729 --> 02:07:53.032
ENOUGH- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:55.167
HIM TO DO THAT IT SEEMS TO ME

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:56.869
THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF THE

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:57.536
LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION THAT'S OUR

02:07:57.603 --> 02:07:59.671
JOB IF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.173
IS TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE TO- TO

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:03.142
MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION-

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:04.643
BUT I DON'T. I'M A I'M I'M

02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:06.045
CONCERNED THAT THERE'S NOT A

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:09.581
PERIL OF PLAN THAT I'M HEARING-

02:08:09.648 --> 02:08:10.416
YOU KNOW IN THE PENSION FUNDS

02:08:10.482 --> 02:08:13.118
IN. A IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:14.219
YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH IT

02:08:14.286 --> 02:08:15.687
YOU'RE DOING THE WORK BUT IF

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.423
THERE IS SUCH A PLAN AGAIN I

02:08:17.489 --> 02:08:19.591
THINK I'D BE A GREAT THING TO

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:20.259
DISTRIBUTE- YOU KNOW TO ALL OF

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:23.462
US SO WE CAN. WE CAN SEE IT MAY

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.697
TEMPER. OR A CAR BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:27.232
TO ADJUST- THE KIND OF

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.300
LEGISLATION TO BRING IN FOREIGN

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:31.036
INVESTMENT AND TO TRY TO TIE IT

02:08:31.103 --> 02:08:32.938
TO THE KIND OF TIME LINE SO

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:33.505
YOU'RE ACTUALLY. MORE

02:08:33.572 --> 02:08:36.041
COMFORTABLE WITH- THEM AT THE

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:38.010
SCHOOL YOU LEANING IN THAT YOU

02:08:38.077 --> 02:08:39.478
WANT TO COMMENT AGAIN. I DO

02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:41.280
AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THEY CAN

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.282
DO MORE BUT LIKE THIS HE SAID IF

02:08:43.348 --> 02:08:45.050
THE WORLD HAS A SHIFT AWAY. AND

02:08:45.117 --> 02:08:46.418
A GOOD EXAMPLE THE BIGGEST

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:47.286
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:08:47.352 --> 02:08:54.159
AGRICULTURE. SO CARD SAYS YOU

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:55.461
CANNOT USE THIS TRY ACTOR IN

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.262
CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU CAN USE IT

02:08:57.329 --> 02:08:59.098
IN ELSE IN THE WORLD- THE- KIND.

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:00.432
THAT THAT IS NONSENSE. BECAUSE

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:01.366
THAT JUST DRIVES UP PRICES IN

02:09:01.433 --> 02:09:04.169
CALIFORNIA SO. I THINK IT'S BEEN-FORCED DOWN BY THE LEGISLATURE

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:05.571
THE PUBLIC. ON THE CLIMATE

02:09:05.637 --> 02:09:07.639
CHANGE THINGS I THINK- PERSON

02:09:07.706 --> 02:09:09.508
STARS IN THE REST EIGHTY FIVE

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.577
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS. CAN DO TO

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:13.579
FIGURE OUT HERE OUR GOALS. HOW

02:09:13.645 --> 02:09:14.980
TO GET THERE AND I THINK THEY

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:16.348
CAN DO THAT MAYBE THEY'VE SHOWN

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:18.083
THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN INSTEAD

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.918
OF YOU HAVE IT FORCED DOWN THEIR

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:22.154
THROAT WITH THAT AND A BAG WITH

02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:23.455
IT WITH THE CHERRY IT'S I'D LOVE

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:25.290
TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS. HOW WE GET
