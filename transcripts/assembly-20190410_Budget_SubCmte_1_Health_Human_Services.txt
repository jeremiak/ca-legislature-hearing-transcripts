USE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH C. C. R. [inaudible] THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF FEATURE BINGO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THERE -- I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND THANK YOUR STAFF THEY DID A VERY THOROUGH MULTI PAGE JOB DESCRIBING THE C. C. R. I'M GONNA RUN THROUGH IT VERY QUICKLY FOR REFERENCE WITH SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS BUT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE. THE TIME TO READ IT BACK TO YOU EITHER. WONDERFUL -- THE C. C. R. THANK YOU FOR DEFINING THE ACRONYM -- RESULTED FROM LEGISLATION A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT LED TO A MULTI YEAR ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THAT EFFORT CULMINATED IN A JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ACCOMPANIED WITH A JANUARY -- BUDGET PROPOSAL -- FROM FROM THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION HAD A MULTI YOUR VIEW ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILY -- IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY AROUND CHILD WELFARE OF COURSE -- THE THERE WERE A VARIETY OF OF GOALS OF THE OF THAT WITHIN THAT BUT PRIMARILY AROUND THE REDUCING THE USE OF CONGREGATE CARE -- WE WE FOUND THAT WHILE OF COURSE THERE ARE GOOD CONGREGATE CARE PROVIDERS TO PRODUCE GOOD OUTCOMES BY AND LARGE THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT A DEMOGRAPHIC LEVEL -- ARE BETTER FOR USE WHEN THEY ARE IN HOME BASED FAMILY CARE SITUATIONS WITH IT WITH A A MORE LIMITED -- GROUP GROUP AROUND THEM -- THAT THEY CAN BE CARED FOR YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T JUST TAKE KIDS OUT OF A GROUP HOME YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM. SO THAT WAS THE REFLECTION IN THE INITIAL INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE C. C. R. IN TERMS OF FAMILY -- RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT. IN -- RE RE CASTING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VARIOUS FACILITY TYPES THAT WE HAVE. A MAKING SETTING THE EXPECTATION THAT GROUP HOMES WOULD BE PHASED OUT IN THE CHILD WELFARE ARENA IN FAVOR OF SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS -- I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD CRISIS STABILIZATION BUT THEY WERE ENVISIONED AS SIX MONTHS MAXIMUM PLACEMENTS AND LAST THOSE STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD AND YOUTH INDICATED A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WAS NEEDED. AND THAT REALLY THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORT WAS TO GET HOME BASE FAMILY KERR -- WE HAVE GONE TO SINCE JANUARY TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS OF POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WITH COUNTIES WITH PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM AND WE'VE BEEN MOVE NOW BEYOND THE JUST THE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AND MORE NOW A COUPLE YEARS INTO THAT. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE IN THE FUNDING -- THAT THAT -- IS IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET AND HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET -- IN ADDITION TO EFFORTS TO A RETAIN AND RECRUIT FAMILIES AND TO CHANGE THE THE MIX OF PROVIDER TYPES AND OUR SERVICE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE PROVIDERS. A CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING CONCEPTS WERE A MAJOR FEATURE OF THIS IT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IT'S NO SECRET TO ANYBODY THAT WHEN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE HAD A VOICE AND BEEN ABLE TO BE HEARD THEY HAVE MORE BY INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM. AND SO CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING AROUND DECISIONS ABOUT PLACEMENT ABOUT SERVICE NEEDS -- ABOUT DURATION OF CARING OVERALL CASE MANAGEMENT AND WHAT'S IN A COURT REPORT THOSE ARE ALL FEATURES OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING. EXCUSE ME SACRAMENTO ALLERGIES -- THE OTHER MAJOR FEATURE -- WELL IT WAS A DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW RATE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS PRIOR TO THIS -- WE'VE HAD AN AGE BASED SYSTEM WHERE AS A CHILD GOT OLDER RATE RATES CHANGED -- WE'VE DOW IMPLEMENTED A RATE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BASED ON THE SS STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD. AND INTENDED TO BETTER SUPPORT FAMILIES -- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TEN HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLAR A MONTH INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT GIVEN TO FAMILIES. A CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SERVICES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES -- AND OTHER CHANGES -- TO FOR EXAMPLE THEY THE PHASE OUT OF THE GROUP HOME RATES AND REPLACEMENT WITH A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO CALL THEM S. T. R. T. P. S. -- AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR AGENDA THEY HAVE NEW RATES AS WELL -- THOSE THOSE ARE REALLY THE HIGHLIGHTS I WANTED TO HIT FOR YOU THERE WAS MAYBE ONE OTHER ON PAGE THIRTEEN THERE'S A MENTION OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT'S BEEN A HUGE FOCUS FOR MANY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN DATING BEFORE THE C. C. R.. WE KNEW IT AS KATIE A LITIGATION KATIE. A WAS THE THE NAME OF THE YOUTH -- IN THAT LITIGATION -- AND WE'VE DONE AND MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CALIFORNIA INCREASING THE ABILITY OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CARE TO ACCESS NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE RE CAST THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FEATURES PROMINENTLY AND NOT. AND THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS AS A AS A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THEIR SERVICE PREVENTION. IN TERMS OF FINDING YOUR CHART ON PAGE. SIXTEEN OF AT THE TOP THERE ARE LATE LAYS OUT THAT THE THE RECENT HISTORY AND A PROPOSAL -- FOR FOR C. C. R. YOU WILL NOTICE THE TOP FOUR LINES ALIGNED WITH THE MAJOR THEMES THAT I TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE RATE CARE -- PAYMENTS THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS THE THE SUPPORT FOR FOSTER PARENT CARE GIVERS AND RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WHAT WE USED TO CALL A FOSTER FAMILY HOME IS NOW KNOWN AS A RESOURCE -- FAMILY -- SO THAT'S A TERMINOLOGY CHANGE BUT THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME THOSE ARE THAT THE HOME BASED FAMILY KERR -- PROVIDERS CARE GIVERS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN YOUR AGENDA -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT'S BEEN DIFFICULT UNDERSTANDING ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS THE THE TRANSFER OF OF FAMILIES FROM A FOSTER FAMILY DESIGNATION TO A RESOURCE FAMILY DESIGNATION. HAS BEEN SLOWER ¬çN EVERYBODY ANTICIPATED -- THERE'S BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS AND BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND THE LAST ADMINISTRATION IN THE CURRENT BUDGET TO GET -- THROUGH A BACKLOG TO APPROVE THOSE MORE TIMELY -- BUT THERE WAS A FUNDING AUGMENTATION MADE A COUPLE YEARS NOW -- THAT WE USED TO PAY -- FAMILY CARE GIVER WHEN THE CHILD I AM SORRY WHEN THEY HOME WAS APPROVED AS A PLACEMENT. BUT VERY OFTEN WE FIND PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL AND SO THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE FAMILIES DIDN'T HAVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT MAYBE WOULD HAVE HELPED THEM. EITHER BE A BETTER CARE GIVER OR BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A CHILD IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A MAJOR INVESTMENT THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL TOOL HELPS US TO SIGN THE NEEDS BASE RATE TO A CHILD. CANS THE CHILD ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS AND STRENGTHS IS THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WE'RE USING TO IDENTIFY THE NEEDSAND STRENGTHS OF THE YOUTH. AND THEN THERE ARE THE OTHER BUCKET WHICH I WON'T DESCRIBE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS LUMPED INTO THAT -- ON PAGE SEVENTEEN THERE'S A MENTION OF A COUPLE BCP'S. A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS -- AT THE BOTTOM OF SEVENTEEN AND ON TO EIGHTEEN OTHER WAS RECENT LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR -- AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY -- THAT TALKED ABOUT INTEGRATED SYSTEMS OF CARE -- AND AND HOW WE GET EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF A KID THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CROSSOVER A FOSTER YOUTH ISN'T JUST A FOSTER YOUTH THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL THEY MAY HAVE. INVOLVEMENT WITH THE DISABILITY SYSTEM MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- WE HAVE YOU THROUGH OR DO ONLY INVOLVED WITH PROBATION SO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE USE. IT WE'RE ASKING FOR STATE POSITIONS TO TO WORK ON THAT. AND THE SECOND ITEM ON THE TOP OF PAGE -- EIGHTEEN IS -- C. C. R. WAS CUT TITLE COMPLIANCE WORKLOAD BUT THESE THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE CORE OF OUR CC OUR IMPLEMENTATION TEAM AT THE DEPARTMENT WE'RE ASKING THEIR RENT -- IT RENEW ALL AN EXTENSION -- HERE THROUGH TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RECOGNIZING THE PACE OF CCR HASN'T BEEN WHAT IT IS THESE ARE OUR RESIDENT EXPERTS PROVIDING ASSISTANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK ACTUALLY GETS DONE. I WON'T DISCUSS THE ADVOCACY PROPOSALS BECAUSE WERE ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM IN THE NEXT COUPLE AGENDA ITEMS -- AND THERE'S A FEW PAGES STARTING ON PAGE TWENTY WHERE THE LA -- GOES THROUGH A NUMBER OF COMMENTS WE FOUND WHAT THE LA -- HAD TO SAY ABOUT CC ARE AT THIS POINT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND FOCUSED ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- WE LARGELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE LA -- AND WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT LEVEL OF CARE IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US IN THE AGENDA AHEAD OF TIME. A WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR I CAN -- TURN IT TO MY COLLEAGUE -- GREG ROSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION TO GO THROUGH THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. THANKS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- GREG ROSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AND COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO MENTION BEFORE ANSWER THE THE FIRST QUESTION. YEP YOU DIRECTOR TRIPPING CAN MENTION SOME OF THE THE THE THE SUCCESSES AND THE CHALLENGES OF OF C. C. R. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE A COUPLE OF THINGS AS WELL. ONE AND WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE OF OVER A THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE IN CONGREGATE CARE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THAT THEY'RE THE NUMBER OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS IS INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH ON CHILD WELFARE AND ON PROBATION MANAGE CASES WE'RE SEEING SOME SOMBER SOLID PARTNERSHIPS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT I THINK WILL BE -- THAT WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE THE SYSTEM FORWARD. AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF UPSTATE COLLABORATION WITH LOOK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS CASE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS -- SO THAT WE CAN BETTER CERTAIN THE WEEK WE CAN LEARN AND WE CAN ALSO BETTER SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE -- AND HELP THEM GET THE NEEDS THE THE THE THINGS THEY NEED. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE A A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT WE I THINK ARE IMPORTANT WE FOCUS ON IN THIS -- THIS COMING YEAR AS WE DO IMPLEMENTATION ONE OF THOSE IS THERE'S THERE'S A AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE IN -- CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THAT -- ON MAY NOT OR ARE SOME MAY NOT AND SOME HAVE TOLD US THEY WILL NOT BE TRANSITIONING -- THE THE DAY THE COUNTIES ASSESSMENT OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE IS ABOUT SEVENTY SOME ODD PERCENT REQUIREMENTS -- FOR FOR A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM AND SO IT TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK THAT WE WE WE AS A AS A AS A GROUP OF COLLEAGUES NEED TO FOCUS ON CLEARLY WE NEED. TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE BACKLOG OF THE RFA APPLICATIONS AND THEIR AND AND I THINK THE THE THE KEY AS I THINK IS MENTIONED ACTUALLY IN THE AGENDA ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF THE AT OF THE OF THE INITIATIVE. IS HIGH QUALITY CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR AND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEM HAVE BOYS AND CHOICE AND WE ARE SEAT WE'RE SEEING THE THE AS I MENTIONED WE'RE SEEING THE INCREASE OF THOSE -- WE ALSO ARE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE WITH HIGH HIGH QUALITY AND WITH HIGH FIDELITY WITH THAT SAID I'M HAPPY -- TO TRANSITION INTO ACT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED INTO THE AGENDA. THE THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ARE ARE ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE AND AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR JAMAICA MENTIONED THAT -- THERE HAD BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS OF THE THE SPECIFICALLY IS A QUESTION ABOUT -- ABOUT THE ELIMINATION AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE A COUPLE OF POINTS ONE THE THE COUNTIES HAVE HAD TO HAVE A PRIOR TO TO REALIGNMENT AND AND HAVE HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY. TO DO -- APPROVALS AND THEY'VE HAD SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THE ADMINISTRATION CLEARLY KNEW GET GIVEN THE THE THAT HEAVY LEFT IN FRONT OF US. AND THE INTENT AND THE AND THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY NEEDED -- FOR TO TO DO RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT -- CREATED TO IN ESSENCE A THREE YEAR -- THAT A THREE THREE YEAR FUNDING TO PROVIDE -- THAT UP FRONT INVESTMENT IN IN THESE ACTIVITIES SO THE THE REDUCTION HAS BEEN THE REDUCTION IN THESE FUNDS IT HAS BEEN AT WHAT'S PLANNED -- WHEN WE HAVE FROM THE FIRST YEAR -- OF THAT ADDITIONAL -- ROLLOUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION -- AND SO BOTH WITH THAT BOTH WITH THE THE SO CALLED SHIPPERS FUNDS THAT FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION PONDS AND AND THE OUR FATE DOLLARS WERE INTENDED TO PROVIDE -- A SURGE OF ACTIVITY TO TO ALSO IDEA I I IDENTIFY AREAS THE OF IN FOR INNOVATION AT AND FUTURE -- REINVESTMENT BYE BYE COUNTIES -- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS OR YOU WANT US WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STOP AFTER EACH. ONE DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ISRAEL OKAY. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE CONTINUE -- YOU -- INDICATED THAT THERE IS A BACKLOG IN OUR FAVOR APPROVAL CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE BACKLOG IS OR HOW LONG IT'S TAKING I KNOW THERE WAS A DISCUSSION LAST YEAR AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO ADD. TO THE BACKLOG IS DECLINE IS DECLINING -- THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS I A CAN HAVE FOR YOU BEFORE THE END OF THE HEARING I DON'T HAVE THEM IT IN IN FRONT OF ME AT THE MO THEY'VE BEEN DEBT THERE'D. THEY'VE DECLINED BY -- AS I RECALL THE TWENTY SOME ODD PERCENT THE TIME TO APPROVAL IS STILL OPEN BUT IT'S STILL OVER NINETY DAYS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER NINETY DAYS. THE THE THE THE TREND IS THAT THE THE BACKLOG IS TRENDING DOWN AND THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IS TRENDING UP. SO -- DEAD. SO AT THAT THE US THAT TIME FOR APPROVAL IS IS DECLINING BUT IT'S STILL IT'S STILL IN EXISTENCE I KNOW AND I IF I RECALL CORRECTLY LAST YEAR WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE APPROVED IT WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS AND WE HAD ASSURANCES LAST YEAR THAT -- THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE THE YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S TAKING AND WHY. SINCE LAST YEAR WE HAD THE DISCUSSION WHY HAS ANY CHANGE RIGHT AFTER THE PROMISES SO THAT SOME AT THE THERE ARE. FOUR ON THE PLACEMENTS PRIOR TO APPROVAL SO THESE WERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN RELATIVE CARE -- THE THE THEIR OF THE THE BACKLOG THE LAST I CHECKED WITH ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SET AND AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. THE THEY ARE AND AND 61% OF THOSE CASES THAT ARE AT THAT ARE THAT ARE GOING ON BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS ARE -- ARE -- HAVE BEEN GRANTED GOOD COSTS OF THEIR THINGS THAT THE THE BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE CHECK AND THAT AND FAMILY ARE OF WITHOUT WITHOUT THEIR CONTROL SOME OF THEM HAPPENED TO DO WITH. THE LENGTH OF TIME RIGHT WHAT IT COST ME GOOD CAUSE MEANS THAT THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A A REASONABLE THERE'S ARE A REASONABLE REASON. FOR THAT FOR THAT FOR THAT THE THE TIME TO GO BEYOND NINETY DAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN TO BE THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK COMPLETED. SOME OF THEM HAVE TO HAVE TO DO WITH SOME OF THAT WHICH IS THE THAT THAT ONE OF THE LARGER ONES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH SOME -- PHYSICAL PLANT THINGS IN THE HOME. EXAMPLES ARE SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH -- SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH OF UP APPROPRIATE FENCING OR SOMETIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH -- WITH -- SMOKE DETECTORS AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS BUT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S THOSE KINDS OF PHYSICAL PLANT THINGS BY BUT AND YOU KNOW Y. ALLEY I THINK WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS -- SMOKE DETECTORS ARE. TRIVIAL IN MY OPINION SEARCH LE IT'S LARGER THAT THAT THE THE THE THE WHOLE I DON'T HAVE MY LIST TO AND FROM THE I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. THE THE THE THEY TEND TO IT THAT THAT HOME. THINGS HAPPEN TO BE THEY THEY'RE OFTEN. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE FLAUNTING WHAT THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE ALSO SITUATIONS WHERE A FAMILY MOVED. TO SEND SOMEBODY TO GET THOSE LISTS FOR YOU SURE IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE'RE HAVING THIS COME I EAT I WILL HI I HAVE SOME OF THE INFORMATION -- IN MY BACKPACK I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH FAMILIES WILL MOVE -- LIKE AT AT B. TIP TO HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TO AS THEY'VE TAKEN ON THE YOUNG PERSON. AT MICH THROUGH THE APPROVAL AND THAT REQUIRES ANOTHER HOME AND GROUNDS INSPECTION SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THERE'S A FEW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THAT -- ARE AT THAT -- HAVE THAT THE CURRENT THERE'S A NUMBER SIX AS I SAID THAT. TIME TO APPROVAL PAST NINETY DAYS EVENTS ALL ITS ON THE MEANTIME I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT AT CHURCH TRYING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE HAD A FEW -- IN THE MEANTIME WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS THOSE KIDS ARE IN PLACEMENTS WITH THEIR RELATIVE. AT AT THAT POINT THERE THE RELATIVES ARE BEING REIMBURSED FOR THAT FOR THAT THERE OKAY SO WITH THAT WAS THAT THAT BIGELOW A DISCUSSION I ONE RELATED DISCUSSION INSTEAD OF AN ARGUMENT LAST YEAR. ABOUT HOW LONG IT WAS TAKING FOR THE OUR PAY. FOR THE FOR THE FAMILIES TO RECEIVE PAYMENT NOW SO THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS IS THERE A BACKLOG IN PAIN THOSE FAMILIES. NOT THAT WE'RE AWARE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OKAY. ARE INEVITABLY I'M SURE THAT SOMEBODY COULD FIND A SITUATIONAL SOMEBODY I'M. SOMEBODY IS ONE THING BUT THE LIGHT IN GENERAL AS HE IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN PAY UP TO A YEAR OF PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL OKAY SOLD MIKE IN SEOUL JUST TO BE CLEAR. SO FAMILIES ARE BEING PAID CREATES ARE IN THE HOMES IN THE MEAN AROUND IT'S JUST THE OFFICIAL APPROVAL HASN'T BEEN GRANTED CORRECT PLACEMENT PENDING APPROVAL. THE IMPROVE AS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR OPINION BUT IT'S NOT DELAYING THE WELL BEING AND CARE OF THE CASE IS THAT ONCE AGAIN WHICH IS OUR FOR MISTER THAT WORKERS HERE THAT THAT WAS BOB BIG. DISCUSSION LAST YEAR OKAY AND THEN -- YOU SAID THERE'S SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. OF A CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. THAT'S THE THE BACKLOG OF THE OF THE ROUTE THAT THE OF THE BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS SO THE MORE THE RELATIVE AND SIXTY SEVEN CASES. GIVE OR TAKE A FEW BRIGHT AND THE MAKE THE THE BAR. 99% OF THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE PLACED. CORRECT THE OF THAT THAT NUMBER I PROVIDE THEY'RE ALL PLACE THERE THAT THEY'RE ALL THEY ALL OUR RELATIVES WITH THAT ARE AT THAT HAVE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE WHO ARE BEING COMPENSATED WHO GET THE STIPEND THE FOSTER CARE STIPEND FOR WHILE THAT WHILE THE WORK IS GOING THAT'S GREAT. NEWS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A BIG A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AFTER A LOT OF THE FOLKS WERE HERE AND INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO -- PAYMENT FOR THEM FOR IT RIGHT YOU TO FOUR MONTHS AND YOU KNOW SO THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY THAT ALL THAT PART HAS BEEN SOLVED BASED AS THE THE THE THE ACTUAL APPROVAL TIME. IS TAKING THE SOMETIME AT THE BASE AND THE FINAL CORRECT. OKAY CORRECTS OF FOLKS GET YOUR THAT WORKS ARE BEING SUPPORTED OKAY -- BUT STILL FOR THAT OKAY WERE YOU HAVING UP ARE VERY. THIS IS MY LEASE -- BUT NO I'M I'M REALLY THANKFUL THEN BECAUSE IT FEELS NOW THAT YOU ARE LISTENING -- WE HAD A BIG HUGE DISCUSSION LAST YEAR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK BECAUSE AGAIN I THESE ARE KIDS THAT THAT NEED OUR SUPPORT AND FAMILIES IN NEED OUR SUPPORT SO IF YOU'RE GUARANTEEING ME THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU CAN JUST YOU KNOW GIVE ME THE A DVD OF THE DATA TO SUPPORT THAT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT ABSOLUTELY WE CAN DO THAT -- WERE REPORTING ON C. C. R. IMPLEMENTATION PURSUANT TO SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS JUST LAST MONTH WE GOT TOGETHER WITH YOUR STAFF AND WE PROVIDE A TWENTY SOME ODD PAGE REPORT THAT INCLUDES A CHART WITH THAT INFORMATION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT AS HE EXPLAINED -- THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE WANTING TO BE CARE GIVERS AND NEEDING TO MOVE THROUGH THE PIPELINE AT THE SAME TIME THAT'S HAPPENED. WE'VE MANAGED TO BRING THE BACKLOG DOWN AND I WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN US WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS -- TO BRING THAT THAT BACKLOG DOWN IT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TIME TO APPROVAL IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT ALL OF THAT SAID AGAIN. CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AVERAGE IT'S PROBABLY IN THE WRITTEN WORD IS HUNDRED NINETY DAYS SITE. IT'S ABOUT SAY NOT BY. WILL DO NOW IS THAT WE'LL WHEN WE HEAR FROM. MEDINA -- FRANK JUSTIN RYAN -- AND THEN. PERHAPS HAVE SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOUR ANSWERS ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE DEAN OF COCOA. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES GOOD AFTERNOON -- SPECIFICALLY I AM I'M. GOING TO BE ADDRESSING QUESTIONS FOUR AND FIVE AROUND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- QUESTION NUMBER FOUR HOW DO THE DEPARTMENTS TRACK WHETHER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ARE BEING PROVIDED TO CHILDREN WHO NEED THOSE SERVICES WHETHER OR NOT IN AN S. T. R. T. PEER GROUP HOME -- AND THE TWO DEPARTMENTS -- DO PRODUCE QUARTERLY REPORTS THAT TRACK -- FOSTER CARE CHILDREN CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE WHO MAY NEED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GETTING THOSE SERVICES. THE CHILD WELFARE IS REQUIRED -- TO SCREEN AND ALL CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND THEN MAKE A REFERRAL -- TO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH -- IF THE CHILD SCREENS POSITIVE AND THEN THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TAKES THAT DATA -- FROM THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND MATCHES IT TO OUR DATA TO DETERMINE WHAT SERVICES THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING -- IF IN FACT THEY'RE GETTING THE SERVICES. SO -- WE WE DO THAT MATCH WE DO IT QUARTERLY TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE SERVICE WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND TRACK THAT DATA. AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- TO EXAMINE AND REFINED THAT DATA NUMBER. FOUR AND BEFORE WE GET THE FIVE WHAT IS TODAY TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DELIVERY -- IT TELLS US THAT THE CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY MAKING IT INTO -- THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM MOST OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE RECIEVING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE WHO MAKE IT YEAH? IT DOESN'T HELP OF MY MY MY MICROPHONE IS OFF FOR THOSE WHO WHO. YOU SAY FOR THOSE WHO MAKE AT THE END. WHAT DETERMINES OUR WHAT IS WHAT IS THE HOLD BACK FOR THOSE SO -- THERE IS SOME DATA COLLECTION AND I THINK SOME DATA IMPROVEMENT ISSUES -- THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- CAN ONLY TRACK ONCE THE CHILD HAS MADE IT INTO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND SEE IF THEY HAVE SERVICES SO PERHAPS I WILL. ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO SPEAK TO ON YOUR QUESTION. OKAY SURE REGRETS AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE THE EIGHTY LIMITED THAT. EIGHTY POINT 3% OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SCREEN POSITIVE GET REFERRED -- TO GET REFERRED OVER TO THE OVER TO TO THE MENTAL HEALTH ACT HIM SORRY. HAVE SCREENED -- GET IT GET A REFER SCREEN POSITIVE GET A REFERRAL INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THERE AND THERE'S A MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIRE EVAN OUT OF MEDICAL NECESSITY ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE. ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE SO -- THE THE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT SCREEN POSITIVE -- OUT SO THERE'S A SCREENING AND THEN THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT TO THE CHILD WELFARE WORKER DOES A IN ESSENCE A ROUGH SAFETY IF YOU WILL THAT THE CHILD MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA -- HAD CERTAIN EXPERIENCES THEN THEY WILL -- THEY WILL BE REFERRED OVER TO THAT SPENT TO THE MENTAL HEALTH -- SPECIAL NOW PROGRAM SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AT THAT POINT DOES A MORE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT TO SEE IF THE CHILD MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY. AND IT'S A THEN WENT THEN -- FOLKS WILL THEN THE SERVICES BEGAN BEYOND THAT SHOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW -- SOME SOME SOME FOLKS THAT HAVE SCREENED POSITIVE WILL NOT MEET THE MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIREMENTS SO THAT STE THE THE ONLY SERVICE THEY WILL GET WILL BE AN ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA FOR FURTHER -- FOR FURTHER SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH. WHEN WE HAVE FRANK MEGA I HAD A GERMAN JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM DATA AT THE H. C. S. IS THAT A ROUGHLY THREE IN TEN KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE. MEET THE ENGAGEMENT RATE WHICH IS A STATE THE TERM RATE -- THAT IS THE SORT OF THE METRIC OF MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT IN THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND THAT MEANS FIVE CONTACTS IN A YEAR -- AND SO SEVEN IN TEN ARE NOT AND THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE AS MR ROSE SAID THAT. THE MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITION. AS IT'S APPLIED SCREENS SOME SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE OUT OF THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND TO SOME EXTENT IT'S GOOD FOR KIDS NOT GETTING SICK AND TO THE SCREENING IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT NOT TO HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATION HERE BECAUSE THE BANK COMMITTEES. YOUR COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT SOME LENGTH ALL YEAR BUT THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS MEDICAL NECESSITY. AND HOW IS IT HELPING ARE NOT HELPING KIDS TO EXPERIENCE THE TRAUMA OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND A REMOVAL -- I THINK IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE AN INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT KIDS IN FOSTER CARE OF EXPERIENCED. THAT THINK THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THEM WOULD NOT. NEED ANY SUPPORT FROM OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH MEANINGFUL SUPPORT FROM OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND THE ISSUE THERE IS THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY. IS THAT SOMETHING THEM I HOPE WE CAN WORK ON ON THAT. YES WONDERFUL AND CLEAN UP -- MISS COOK OFFS -- COULD YOU ADDRESS QUESTION NUMBER FIVE BEFORE WE MOVE ON SURE HAPPY TO SO QUESTION NUMBER -- FIVE REGARDING THE PROVISION OF SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HOW IT IS PROGRESSING -- AND AREAS PERHAPS NEEDING ATTENTION -- WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OR OR YEAR AND A THE PROVISION ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE ARE SEEING IS PROGRESSING -- IT MAY VERY BY S. T. R. A. T. P. -- BUT BUT IT IS PROGRESSING -- AREAS OF WHERE -- I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME ATTENTION NEEDED IS PERHAPS ON THE LOWER LEVEL GROUP HOMES -- WHO ARE TRANSITIONING TO S. T. R. T. PEAS -- IN THAT THEY MAY HAVE NOT OR HAVE NOT DEALT WITH ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH -- WITH THESE INTENSIVE -- NEEDS AND ALSO -- MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND REQUIREMENTS AND THE WAY THAT -- SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED -- AND SO IT'S A STEEP LEARNING CURVE ON FOR THEMSO I WOULD SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE -- TO BRAINSTORM ON HOW WE CAN ASSIST SUPPORT -- THAT LEARNING CURVE WHAT IS IT YOU NEED. TO BE ABLE TO SHOW -- THE S. TRT PEAS. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO? IS SIX A STEEP LEARNING CURVE WHAT WHAT IS IT THEY NEED. I FOUND WHAT IS IT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE IT. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT. WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND -- I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION -- THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF EFFORTS STARTING FROM -- TRAINING -- A REGIONAL TRAININGS THAT HAPPENED SOME AT A HIGHER LEVEL BUT TO TRY TO INFORM IT'S BEEN GOING ON REGIONAL COOKIES BROUGHT THE LAST TWO YEARS TO EDUCATE -- S. T. R. T. PEAS OR GROUP -- GROUP HOMES LOOKING TO CONVERT THERE IS -- COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS WHERE WILL ACTUALLY NEED -- WORK WITH -- GROUP HOMES THAT HAVE QUESTIONS -- I THERE IT IS COLLABORATIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THE PLACE IN AGENCIES AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN SO I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF SUPPORTS. THE AT VARIOUS LEVELS THAT CAN HELP WITH THAT LEARNING CURVE. CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IN THE NEXT MONTH OR MONTHS AS% OPPOSED TO IN THE NEXT YEAR OR YEARS -- IS THERE A PLAN IS THEIR SPECIFIC PLAN TO TO DEAL WITH THIS [inaudible] TRANSITION PERIOD. I KNOW THAT YOU SAY THAT FOR TWO YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME BRAINSTORMING BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY AND YOU FOR TRYING TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B.. IS THERE A PLAN SO THAT WE GET THERE. THE THE THE THE WAY THE THE LEAD THAT. THERE IS A PLAN THE PLAN THE IS BASED PARTLY BASED ON THE THE THE THE LEGISLATION WHICH COURT REQUIRES THIS KIND OF LINEAR PROCESS FIRST. FIRST YOU GET LICENSE TO IT WITH THE NEW UNDER THE NEW CRITERIA AND ADMITTEDLY ARE -- SCRUTON T. OF THE LICENSING PROCESS IN THE LICENSING DOCUMENT IS IS IS VERY HIGH FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS WE ARE LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT RATHER THAN -- IN OUR OLD WAY OF THE AUDITING WHERE WE KIND OF COUNTED ACCOUNTED THINGS AND ONLY LOOK AT MONEY WE WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ASSESS QUALITY AND SO PART OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS. BEING CLEAR THAT. WE WOULD HOLD THE THE WE WOULD ASSESS THE THAT PROVIDERS OF QUALITY BASED ON WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE. WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS GOING TO DO WHAT IS YOUR PROGRAM GOING TO BE HOW ARE THEY GOING TO FOCUS ON ON THAT THE HEALING THE TRAUMA HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED HOW ARE THEY HOW WILL THE IN? HOW WILL THE IMPLEMENTED PROVIDE THAT THE INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO OUR OWN PROCESS TAKE IT IT TAKES A WHILE IT IT'S AN INTERNET PROCESS? ONLY THEN ONCE THEY'RE LICENSED CAN THEY GO OVER AND GET THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS DOING -- AND SOME COUNTIES ARE DOING AS WELL AND THEN ONCE THEY HAVE HAVE GONE AND GOTTEN THAT PROGRAM APPROVAL THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. TO ACTUALLY GET A CON GET CERTIFIED TO GET A CONTRACT SO IT'S A LINEAR PROCESS THAT IT TAKES A WHILE OUR PLAN TO GET PEOPLE -- FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER HE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF REGIONAL CONVENING AND INCLUDING JUST RECENTLY A NUMBER OF OF OF WEBINARS AND OTHER ENGAGEMENT WHERE. SOME OF THAT THAT THE THE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AND AND WE'RE AND TURNED THE CORNER MORE QUICKLY ARE ARE PROVIDING. HERE KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BE IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE TWO DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS DOING SOME COUNTIES ARE ALSO -- PARTNERING LOCALLY TOOK TO HELP SUPPORT -- THAT THAT THE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE YET WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO YOU PREPARE. SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY -- ACHIEVE THE PROGRAM APPROVAL SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF OF OF OF OF EFFORTS GOING -- BUT THE PROCESS IS IN FACT A LINEAR AND THEN AT THE END OF IT THE EVEN THE THE CONTRACTING PROCESS THAT LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAVE SELECTIVE CONTRACTING AND THEY THEY THEY CAN CHOOSE TO CONTRACT OR NOT TO CONTRACT WITH ANY GIVEN PROVIDER. IF IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE PITCHER FRANK AGAIN. I I WOULD JUST ADD ON TO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T UNDER STATE THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT GOING INTO THE WORK HERE -- THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FACILITIES TRYING TO TRANSITION THE MALL IT IS A REALLY DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING -- WE ARE FOCUSED WITH OUR COUNTIES -- OUR STAFF AND AND SOME OF THE THIRTY FOUR IN THE B. C. P. THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER OR ENGAGE pCOLLEAGUES IN OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES WE DO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY INDIVIDUAL CALLS WITH THOSE COUNTIES. WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE SEEING SPECIFICALLY COUNTY BY COUNTY ON THE GROUND WE'RE ALSO PRIORITIZING OUR EFFORT -- TO TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE NEED CAPACITY TO I'M KEY FOR YOU HOW MANY -- YOU SAID YOU YOU MAKE CALLS ARE YOU HAVE -- CALDERON COUNTIES HOW OFTEN -- SOME OF THOSE ARE WEEKLY DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT OFTEN YEAH. A LARGE AMOUNT IS ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE CASES TO WORK THROUGH MORE SITUATIONS TO WORK THROUGH THANK YOU YEAH ABSOLUTELY. SO I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THERE SOME VAGUE PLANNERS ACTIVE WORK THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT WORK THAT'S GOING ON ON A VERY INDIVIDUAL BASIS HERE AND MISTER MAC OF PERHAPS OR OTHERS MIGHT WANT TO WEIGH IN. WITH COMMENTS THERE THAT SAID THERE IS MORE THAT COULD BE DONE. YEAH. I JUST TOOK MY REMARKS OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MAKE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT SEATED BDA WHO'S HERE COLE WROTE THE REPORT. THAT GAVE RISE TO THE C. C. R. LEGISLATION WITH WITH MISTER ROSEN SO -- WE'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DO CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. I POINT OUT THAT THAT CCR ISN'T ONE REFORM CC ARE IS NO FEWER THAN FIVE MAJOR REFORMS THAT ARE ALL BEING UNDERTAKEN AT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE DO SOCIAL WORK WERE CHANGING THE NATURE OF RESIDENTIAL. CARE INTO INTO SHORT TERM TREATMENT WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE APPROVED FAMILIES WERE CHANGING THE LIGHT THE THE RATE SYSTEM FOR FAMILIES WERE CHANGING THE WAY AND THE NATURE -- BUT TWO OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND AND CHILD WELFARE AND ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO I WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE WHAT MR JOVANKA SAID THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING. ALL THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKE SOME STOCK AND HOW IT'S GOING WE MADE SOME BIG ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. WITH C. C. R. WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND BY WHEN AND I DO THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY. SERVE HOW THE GOING AND AS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE AND AS WE SHOULD PROBABLY EXPECT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL. AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS AND PROBABLY GIVE RISE TO SOME REASON FOR SOME MID COURSE THINKING -- AND SO WE SORT OF A LINE WITH MR ROSE A SENSE OF OF WHAT'S WHAT'S WORKING THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF KIDS IN CONGREGATE CARE BOTH PROBATION AND CHILD WELFARE KIDS. CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING IS A MUCH BETTER WAY OF DOING SOCIAL WORK FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND THAT'S WELL UNDER WAY THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. AS ARGUE WITH HIM LABOR INTENSIVE AS IT IS AND AT GET IT SO MUCH MORE WORK THAN WE ANTICIPATED TO GET THE EXISTING CASES SORT OF THROUGH THE PIPELINE. IT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY. TO APPROVE AND SUPPORT FAMILIES BECAUSE YOU DO A ROBUST HOME ASSESSMENT. AND SO CARE GIVERS. ARE BETTER ABLE TO CARE FOR CHILDREN WHERE BET BETTER ABLE TO DETERMINE IF IT'S A RIGHT MATCH SO I DON'T WANNA GET LOST IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR A FAIT. THE VALUE OF OF IT -- AS A DIFFERENT AND BETTER WAY OF APPROVING RELATIVES -- AND MANY FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE NOW STARTING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE FAMILIES. THIS IS ONE OF TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF FAMILY BASED PLACEMENTS THAT CC ARE ASSUMED WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR KIDS WHO WERE IN LOWER LEVEL GROUP COMES BUT SHOULDN'T BE LIVING THERE. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED TREATMENT BUT THEY SHOULD BE WITH FAMILIES AND WE MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT. BUILDING OUT INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE AND TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WHAT WAS WHICH WAS ACTUALLY A REQUIREMENT OF THE KD ES SETTLEMENT. AN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SORT OF TAKE OFF. THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE STILL VERY MUCH A WORK AND AND AND PROCESS AND THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF CONCERN. ARE ONES THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED ALREADY ONE IS. THE RELATIVELY SLOW RATE OF CONVERSION OF GROUP HOMES -- INTO -- S. T. R. TEEPEES. ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS WHO ARE IN CONGREGATE CARE ARE IN FILL IN FACILITIES RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. YOU PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THOSE FACILITIES TO CARE FOR THOSE CHILDREN. UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THAT. SORT OF THAT THAT SLOWER RATE OF CONVERSION -- AND WE DO THINK THAT FOR MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES THEY'RE SMALLER FACILITIES THERE COMMUNITY BASED FACILITIES. MAY. THEY ARE QUALITY AND THEY COULD BE VERY THERAPEUTIC PLACES FOR YOU FOR YOU. BUT THE STEPS TO BE CALM APPROVED ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT MISTER ROSE. OUTLINED SORT OF THE THREE THE THREE STEPS AND SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK TO TRY TO HELP THOSE FACILITIES. ALONG THE PROCESS OF LICENSING AND APPROVAL AND THEN CONTRACTING. BUT I DO THINK IT IT'S TIME AND WE ARE BEGINNING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO THINK ABOUT PERHAPS WHETHER WE NEED SOME MORE INTENSE SEVEN MORE INTENTIONAL. SORT OF SPECIFIC TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE. IN A FACILITY THAT WE REALLY BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE CARE NETWORK AND WE INTEND TO TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT. IDEAS -- IDEAS FOR DOING JUST THAT -- THAT CONTRACTING -- THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTRACTING ISSUE I THINK IT'S ONE THAT THAT BEARS KEEPING OUR EYE ON THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN S. T. R. T. PEAS IN THE STATE HAVE HAVE PASSED ALL THREE STEPS -- AND SO. THERE'S ABOUT NINE HUNDRED CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES IN THE STATE BUT I SHOULD QUALIFY THAT BY SAYING THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TO SAY. THAT WE BELIEVE THERE OUGHT TO BE NINE HUNDRED BUT BUT NINETEEN IS A LOW NUMBER -- AND BOB AS WE GET S. T. R. T. PEAS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. THROUGH THE LICENSING PHASE I THINK WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PROBLEM SOLVE. ABOUT HOW THOSE FACILITIES GET MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS FROM COUNTY MENTAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND THAT'S AN AREA I THINK THE BEARS. ARE OUR INTENTIONALITY AND YOUR AND AND YOUR OVERSIGHT -- AND THEN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THEM AJ BUT THEY'RE PEDIC FOSTER CARE. WAS OF AN OUTCOME OF THE KD ES SETTLEMENT THE KATIE A LAWSUIT WITH THE LAWSUIT THAT THE STATE LOST -- THAT -- FOUND THAT THE STATE WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL EPA STT LAW. AND PART OF COMING INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WITH THE PST TO THE COURT REQUIRED WITH REST THAT DEVELOP TREATMENT FOSTER CARE. AND THAT'S BEEN VERY SLOW TO GET OFF THE GROUND AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BECAUSE ANYONE'S BEEN DRAGGING THEIR FEET -- BUT WE MADE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WOULD BE A VIABLE. APPROACH -- TO TO SERVE SOME CHILDREN WHO SEE SEE OUR SAYS GET OUT OF THE GROUP HOPES. BOMB AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON EITHER DEVELOPING TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WITH INTENTIONALITY OR COMING UP WITH A CONTINGENCY PLAN IF IT TURNS OUT THE TREATMENT FOSTER CARE TO IT. IT IS PERHAPS NOT VIABLE IN THE WAY THAT THAT KATIE A COURT -- THOUGHT IT WAS -- THE LAST AND LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS IT'S TAKEN MORE TIME. THAN PERHAPS SOME ORIGINALLY IMAGINED I SHOULD SAY PROBABLY NOT MORE TIME THAN MY MEMBERS IMAGINE -- BUT WE WERE INCREDIBLY AUDACIOUS IN SCOPE AN AMBITIOUS AND TIME FRAME. AND SO WE'LL TALK LATER ON IN THE PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENT BUT OUR MEMBERS EXTREMELY ORRIED ABOUT PULLING OUT THE RUG. PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THOSE UP FROM UP FROM UP FRONT INVESTMENTS LIKE RFA AND THE FAMILY STABILITY FUND BECAUSE THE FAMILY. ARE THE ALTERNATIVE -- TO GROUPON PLACEMENTS AND WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THAT WE NOT. BECAUSE OF AN UNREALISTIC TIME FRAME THAT WE SET OUT AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY AUDACIOUS AN AMBITIOUS. THAT WE NOT PULLED THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THE REFORM IN MID STREAM. WE'RE GOING TO BE SHARING THE CHAIR SHIP -- WE BOTH HAVE BILLS WE'RE PRESENTING. SO WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THAT REGARD -- ALL RIGHT. BEFORE THE FIFTY ABSOLUTELY YEAH SO SO BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUT WE TALKED ABOUT THE NINE HOT. NINE HUNDRED OF FACILITIES IN NINETEEN HAVE PASSED ALL THREE STEPS SOUL CAN YOU ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT NOT TOO MUCH BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW. IF THERE'S ONLY NINETEEN PASS DOES THAT MEAN THAT SOME KIDS ARE CURRENTLY IN THOSE FACILITIES. AND IF THERE IS ONLY NINETEEN AND HAVING FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE? THE I'M OF LET'S JUST ASSUME JUST FOR MY PURPOSES THAT THERE'S NOW IN NINETEEN COUNTY THAT ACTUALLY HAVE ONE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS. TO THOSE OTHER COUNTIES OR THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THOSE KIDS SO OF ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN TWO PARTS THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION -- THE MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACT -- IS NOT A PREREQUISITE AT THIS MOMENT FOR A FACILITY TO CARE FOR A CHILD. THEY EITHER HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES OR THEY HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR RANGING FOR ALL NECESSARY. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT'S NOT THE OPTIMAL SORT OF STATE OF CCR OCT OPERATIONS BUT IT BUT IT IS ALLOWED -- BUT AS WE TO TEAR SECOND PARTY YOUR QUESTION -- THAT CC ARE INTENTIONALLY ENVISIONED REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES. AND YOUR QUESTION HITS TO A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE ONCE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE. ALL THE FACILITIES QUALITY FACILITIES THAT CAN MEET THE TEST OF C. C. R. EXIST ARE THEY WHERE THE KIDS ARE. AND SO THERE ARE SOME REALLY EXCELLENT AS T. R. T. P. TH -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE NOT I MEAN IF YOU'RE NOT IN VENTURA COUNTY YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S YOUR AUTO COUNTY IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO VICTOR. SO -- WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS QUESTION BUT I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT. I CAN SIT HERE RIGHT NOW AND SAY WE'RE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUFFICIENT GEOGRAPHIC. SORT OF AVAILABILITY. OF TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHERE THE WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE RESIDING AND I KNOW WHAT'S ONE THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CROSS MAPPING. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY MANAGE BYE BYE ON FOLLOW UP ON THE THE NOT SO THESE. NINETEEN HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE -- QUALIFIED ARE THE SEEN CHILDREN RIGHT NOW SOLE SO I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS ARE THEIR KIDS CURRENTLY BEING SEEN. OKAY SO THAT THAT MAKES MORE SENSE THEY'RE NOT. EMPTY AND JUST WAITING FOR THE APPROVAL PART PROCESS ARE STILL SEEING CHILDREN BUT YOU HAVE A RACK SO. ALL OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE -- HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEM SOME SOME ARE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR GROUP HOME LICENSE AND FOOD AND AND MEETING THOSE OUGHT THAT LEVEL OF CARE OBLIGATION. SOME ARE LICENSED AS AS SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS BUT DON'T YET HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY'RE AT THEIR MEETING THAT THAT THE HIGHER ACUITY NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BYE BYE -- BY ARRANGING FOR OR ARE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH TO ARRANGE FOR THAT THE SERVICES AND THEN NINETEEN ARE FULLY INTEGRATED ON THIS POINT. SO THERE THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE IS BEING SERVED IN THOSE THERE ARE A GROUP THE GROUP I MENTIONED EARLIER THE EIGHT HUNDRED OR SO THAT -- THAT WON'T MEET S. T. R. T. P. REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN SOME OF THAT -- BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES THAT MAKE THAT HAVE TOLD US EITHER THEY'RE NOT GONNA TRANSITION OR IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THEY WILL ARE THE THAT GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE THE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE AND THE DEPARTMENT ARE WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. ON AT IMMEDIATELY TO LOCATE -- FAMILIES ARE ALL OF THAT CAN CARE FOR THEM IF IN JUST I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT MR ROSE SAID -- WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS THAT GOING FORWARD THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE RECEIVING AND CARING FOR CHILDREN NOW WHO AREN'T FULLY LICENSED -- AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN THE LIMBO PERIOD OR DECIDE THIS IS NOT -- A SERVICE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MEET. AND FOR THOSE THAT EITHER CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO TO BE AN S. T. R. T. P.. IT'S IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THEY NOT BECOME PART OF THE THE S. T. R. T. PEMEX BUT FOR THOSE. THAT CAN AND ARE NECESSARY AND COULD BE GOOD PROVIDERS WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM. TO GIVE UP AND SAID THIS IS THIS IS WAY TOO MANY HURDLES FOR US WE'RE OUT. AND AND IT'S IT'S THAT. I MEAN IN THE SHORT RUN THEY'RE THEY'RE CARING FOR AND SOME OF THEM ARE CARING FOR KIDS BUT AT SOME POINT. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE ARE WE GONNA CONTINUE IN THIS IT TO TO TRY TO DELIVER THE SERVICE ON BEHALF OF STATIC CALIFORNIA OR DO WE HAVE TO BACK OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT ENDS IN DECEMBER. IS THAT CORRECT WHAT ENDS IN DEATH WHAT ENDS IN DECEMBER IS THE PERIOD AFTER DECEMBER ANY CHILD THAT IS IN -- A CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE ITS S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR STATE REIMBURSEMENT. SO IN FACT GIVEN THE GIVEN THE COST IT IT SORT OF MEANS THAT THAT PLACEMENT BECOMES. NOT A VIABLE PLACEMENT AND YOU EXTENDED. FROM THE YEAR BEFORE BACK TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- WITH CONDITIONS THAT I COUNTY COULD ASK FOR AN EXTENSION IF IT PROVED TO THE STATE. EXCUSE ME THAT IT WAS TAKING. APPROPRIATE STEPS TO TRY -- TO GET FAMILIES AND TO GET S. T. R. TO HELP GET US YOUR TEEPEES APPROVED. THE QUESTION THAT THAT OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER WITH YOU AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THIS BUDGET AND IS DO WE THINK DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF NINETEEN CONTINUES TO BE A REASONABLE DATE. AND I BELIEVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL START PROBABLY TOMORROW MORNING AROUND EIGHT O'CLOCK. CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST A PARTY BUT NUMBER SAID SHE IS A BAR IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IT'S GOING TO BED THAT. ALL THE FACILITIES THAT THAT WE WANT BECAUSE THEY DELIVER GOOD CARE AND THEY CAN REALLY -- NEED A CHILD'S NEEDS TO HEAL -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ALL OF THEM WILL WILL GET PAST THE FINISH LINE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT IT TO HAPPEN BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. IT IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAN TO ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. TO ANY TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS. THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE ABOUT TO HAVE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO SORT OF IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A SORT OF A COMMON ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST BEING REASONABLE OR NOT AND AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT MY SUPPOSITION HERE TODAY -- IS BORNE OUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAN KERR'S WE WOULD NEED A STATUTORY CHANGE TO ALLOW -- FOR EXCEPTIONS AND I ASSUME THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD WOULD WANT TO SIMILARLY. ENSURE THAT -- ANNEKE. IN THOSE CASES WERE EXTENSIONS OCCUR DUE DILIGENCE AS BEING MATT. AND TERMS OF FINDING FAMILIES AND AND BECAUSE IT'S NO ONE'S INTENT. TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF YOU KNOW OF OF OF FACILITIES THAT ARE CONVERTED TO AS CHAIR TEEPEES DICK TO BE CONTINUED TO CARE FOR KIDS. BUT IF WE ONLY HAVE NINETEEN OF FIVE MILLION. NINE HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT THERE ARE. OTHER THERE ARE WORTH IT I'M SORRY EACH OF THOSE. HOMES EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES HAVE OUR YOUTH. THEY'VE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE AND IF THERE ISN'T A FAMILY WE CAN'T PUT HIM ON THE STREET IT'S ABOUT HALF OF THE KIDS -- IN IN CONGREGATE CARE RIGHT NOW ARE IN A FACILITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN S. T. R. T. P. LICENSE. AS CHAIR TO BE LICENSE IS THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST THAT -- DEADLINE AND SO IT'S THE THE TEST WOULD BE FINDING FAMILIES FOR FOR THOSE CHILDREN OR END. OR BY GETTING THOSE FACILITIES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE LICENSED AS S. T. R. T. PEAS. SO YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS YOU TACKLE THE PROBLEM FROM TWO DIRECTIONS FINDING FAMILIES IN TRYING TO HELP PUT FACILITIES. GET LICENSED AND WE'RE GONNA BE DOING BOTH AND THE QUESTION IS. OUR OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS IN THIS INVOLVES HELP FROM THE STATE. BOTH STATE AGENCIES AND OTHER COUNTY PARTNERS WELL OUR EFFORTS YIELD ENOUGH RESULTS SUCH THAT WE WOULD NOT NEED AN EXTENSION PAST TWELVE THIRTY ONE NINETEEN AND IT'S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE. THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE THIS REVIEW YES. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND -- FOUGHT THE PARENTS BUT I MAY BE OFF ON THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK ON PAGE SIXTEEN THE I CC ARE SPENDING UNDER TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IT LOOKS LIKE THE FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND SUPPORT IS DECLINED. WITH ACTUALLY ZERO SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIND THESE FAMILIES WHEN. IT INDICATES THAT WE HAVE. ZERO MONEY TO FOR RECRUITMENT I IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY. UNLESS I'M WE ARE WE THINK THAT FUND IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE DIP THE DEPARTMENT IS IS. BRINGING CONTRACTORS LIKE DANNY'S GOODMAN TO HELP US WITH TECHNOLOGIES TO FIND FAMILIES BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE LABOR INTENSIVE ACTIVITY. AND SO FROM FROM THE VERY STRONG VIEWPOINT TO THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. IT IS PREMATURE TO REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE FAMILY STABILITY FUND FORMALLY KNOWN AS FIFTY SOUGHT NOT JUST PAYMENT CHAIR IT'S I'M IT'S CLEARLY GOING IT HUNTER PRODUCTIVE ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLY. WE ARE TO HELP THESE KIDS OUT OF CC ARE ARE OUT OF THE I'M SORRY THE THE HOMES WE NEED FAMILIES BUT WE ARE NOT RECRUITING FAMILIES THERE WERE JUST. WE'RE GOING TO BE SPINNING OUR WHEELS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST IT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. AND UP. IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT BY SO WE HAVE TO HOW CAN WE FIX THIS OR IS VERY PLAN. SINCE THE MONEY IS. ARE. NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE RECRUITMENT AND HOW CAN WE HELP. AND WE WE WE BROUGHT THE ISSUE TO FOR YOUR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY WE WE DEFINITELY INTEND TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO GET TO OF A PLACE WHERE WE ALL AGREE. IS THE RIGHT PLACE AND IT WOULD RESULT IT IT IT. ASSUMING A STATUTORY CHANGES NEEDED WE ABSOLUTELY INTEND TO BRING IT TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEES -- FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU TESTIMONY FROM THE NEXT WITNESS [inaudible] JUSTIN. IT. DOESN'T REDUCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- A IS THERE A SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ON WHAT -- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR JAMAICA AND TO BE DIRECTOR ROSE HAVE EXPENDED ON FOR ME THE MOST. BUT NUMBER AND THE MANY THAT'S BEEN REDUCE I MEAN IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS EVEN BEEN DISCUSSED -- I UNDERSTAND IT'S A NEW ADMINISTRATION BY THIS IS A PRESSING ISSUE AND FOR VARYING OUT THE RECRUITMENT MONEY HAS THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION AS TO REINSTATING SOME OF THAT MONEY OR HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP -- THE THE COUNTIES IN THE RECRUITMENT [inaudible] THROUGH A WHAT I CAN SEE IS THAT THE THE ADMIN AT THE KERN ADMINISTRATION AND MAINTAIN THE SAME PROPOSAL THAT DAY THAT. WAS ORIGINALLY AGREED UPON BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND THE PAST RESTORATION WHEN -- CCR WAS ENVISIONED SO -- WHICH I THINK A CLEAR DISTINCTION HERE'S MAKE IS THAT THERE'S NOT A REDUCTION AND AT WHAT WE WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO AS VAPERS OUR FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION SUPPORT FUNDING -- RECRUITMENT PROCESS SO IT ENDS UP BECOMING A COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY IN AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR ROSE SAID COMMENTED ON EARLIER. THE THE DISCUSSION OF OF CCR AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE THE SITE AT THE GROUP HOME POPULATION FROM THE CONGREGATE CARE. TO THE HOME BASED SETTING I WAS LOOK AT THAT THERE IS IT'S AN INITIAL INVESTMENTS -- SO ACT AS YOU READ THIS TIME THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE A PROPOSAL BEYOND'S MAINTAINING THAT SARAH THAT ORIGINAL INITIAL UP FRONT INVESTMENT NOW TO THE EXTENT. THAT A THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY -- AS USUAL WERE VERY HAPPY. TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE RECOUNT ON THAT'S BUT WHAT KNOWN BUT LET ME JUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE WHAT I'M WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE IS AN INITIAL INVESTMENT BUT ACCORDING TO THIS CHART IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE INITIAL INVESTMENT WAS -- TWENTY ONE THOUSAND IT'S TWENTY ONE SIX THIRTY BOB BUT THERE IS NO THE MAIN. MAINTAINING THAT ORIGINAL INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE IF YOU LOOK ABOUT CHARLIE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS -- FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MAINTAINING -- THE THE TWENTY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THEN PROPOSED FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE IS NOT A PROPOSAL. TO MAINTAIN OR AT ANY ENTITLED THAT THAT IS NOT MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT IT'S AS WELL AS WHERE I'M GETTING HUNG UP ON BECAUSE HE SAID THAT THERE IS AN INTENT TO MAINTAIN THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT. AND BUYS HEARING IT OUT IS NOT MAINTAINING IN MY UNDERSTANDING IT. UNDERSTANDING IT NO I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR YOUR QUESTION AND THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENTS WAS THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME -- AGAIN JUST A TO RESET AGAIN ADD TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP. ALSO IN THAT CONVERSATION IS IS TO SHOULDN'T IT BE ARE ALSO A PRIORITY OF THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN I THINK WE YOU KNOW THE SO I APPRECIATE. THAT YOU'RE HERE BY BUT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US WHICH WAS INDICATED BY MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THAN. THAT THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INDICATED TO ME THAT THERE WAS A PRIORITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I I I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT THE POINT BEING. THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IT BACK ON US I WHICH I CAN APPRECIATE HOWEVER THE THE THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT INDICATED THAT THERE WERE SOME WILLINGNESS FROM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE WITH THIS. CELL. EIGHT I DON'T SEE THE I'M. THE INTENT. I GUESS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE YOUR YOU KEEP INDICATING THAT IF THERE'S AN INTENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. THAN THAN -- THAN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COMPLY BUT THE NICHOLS CAUGHT UP BACK TO WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY SAID THAT. THEY WERE MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THE IN IT JUST THERE THERE'S NO INTENT ISN'T WHAT MY QUESTION IS ARE MY POINT IS. BY THE NINE INVESTMENT THIS TIME. AND MADAME CHAIRS -- THE FROM THIS FROM THIS THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COUNTIES THAT ARE THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS REFORM ON YOUR BEHALF WE ASSUMED A LOT OF THINGS THREE YEARS AGO. SO IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE ASSUMED THAT WE WOULD HAVE ALL THE FAMILIES WE NEEDED -- WE ASSUMED THAT ALL THE S. T. R. T. PIECE WOULD HAVE CONVERTED. THE KD ES COURT ASSUME WE HAVE TREATMENT FOSTER CARE WE ASSUMED A LOT OF THINGS SOME OF THEM HAPPENED AND SOME OF THEM DID NOT AND SO. IT SEEMS I WOULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION THAT INHERITED CC ARE FROM THE PRIOR% ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE'RE ALL IN GOOD FAITH MAKING MID COURSE CORRECTIONS AND WORKING AS HARD AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS REFORM SOME THINGS ARE GOING AS PLANNED AND SOME THINGS AREN'T. SO TO SAY WELL THREE YEARS AGO WE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL GOING TO BE DONE AND IT'S NOT SO IF YOU WANT TO DO IT AFTER THREE YEARS IT'S ON YOU BUT THAT'S NOT OUR PRIORITY. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO VIEW OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT CURRENT LAW BECAUSE CCAR'S CURRENT LAW. AND IF WE'RE ALL TOGETHER MAKING A GOOD FAITH MID COURSE CORRECTIONS AND ASSESSMENT OF HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE SAME ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FINANCING SIDE. I THINK THAT THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS. ARE THESE REDUCTIONS GOING TO HELP OR HURT C. C. R.. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HURT IT I MEAN I ASSUME WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE REDUCTIONS WILL HURT IT. I THINK THAT THE THE IF WE TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES IT ISN'T LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY ONLY I THINK IT HAS TO BE A MUTUAL PRIORITY. AND I THINK IF WE VIEW IT THAT WAY JUST AS YOU SAID WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. ARE WE WE WE END. WE HAVE TO AT TIMES TAKE A REFRESHED LOOK. AT ANY VALUATION AS OPPOSED TO SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE DECIDED ON AND THAT'S IT. EVERY YEAR I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO. THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT WE CAN WILL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO IN THE END. WILL HELP US TAKE CARE OF THAT SUIT THE C. C. R.. IT HELPS TO TO REACH THE THE THE GOALS THAT WE WANT FROM THE C. C. OURS THIS WAS ONE OF ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENT MISTER FOR THIS -- I SAT HERE FIVE FOR TWO YEARS UNDER ALL GOVERNOR BROWN AND I KEEP GETTING -- THE SAME KIND OF STANDARD ANSWERS -- FROM YOU KNOW THAT ADMINISTRATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WILL HELP YOU WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ALL OF THAT WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING AND I SAW THIS GOVERNOR. OUT WITHOUT A FRESH NEW LOOK WITH HOPE WITH -- MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO TRULY BE PARTNERS IN THIS AND SOLD IF YOU. I DON'T MEAN TO I AM BE BRASH. ABOUT THIS BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS IN THIS AND AND AGAIN FOR ME IT WAS HOPEFUL TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR INDICATE THAT WE WERE ALL GOING TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER AND SOUL. SOUL I'M DON'T WANNA SEEM FRUSTRATED BUT I'M GOING TO GET FRUSTRATED WHEN I KEEP HEARING THE SAME YOU KNOW WHAT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WHICH IS REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING I DON'T WANT TO START OUR RELATIONSHIP -- THAT WAY I WANT US TO REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND RATHER THAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND YOU KNOW ALL THE RHETORIC. FRANKLY THAT I GOT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION I WAS REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS BECAUSE THIS IS CHILDREN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT PLEASE. YOU KNOW FROM NOW ON THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THE I GOT THE LIP SERVICE ALREADY FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND I DON'T WANT. TO GET IT HERE. THESE ARE TWO CRITICAL -- IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TO GET THE SAME LIP SERVICE AND I AGAIN MY HOPE IS THAT THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WE CAN GET ANSWERS AND IT'S NOT PUNITIVE IN ANY MEANS I JUST WANT SOME -- WILLINGNESS TO TO SIT DOWN AND REALLY BE PARTNERS IN THIS INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW GETTING THE LIP SERVICE SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THAT IT IN THE FUTURE. I I WE CAN WE LIMIT THE YOU KNOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANT. RESPONSES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HELPFUL WE NEED ACTUAL -- ANSWERS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TO MAKE THIS A SOLUTION I'M NOT HERE -- TO BATTLE WE'RE HERE. TO I HAVE SOLUTIONS AND CREATE PATHWAYS SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST THE COUNTIES AND ASSIST THESE CHILDREN AND AND AND THE SERVICES THAT WE IN OUR PROMISING [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO I I I DON'T THINK THAT THE THE APPROACH OF THE MINISTRATION IS TO TO TAKE THIS AS YOU SAID THIS COMBAT EVER NOT BE SUPPORTIVE I THINK THAT'S WHEN THE BEAUTIES OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT IN THE IN THE HEARINGS THAT WE GO THROUGH IS. THE ADMINISTRATION PUTS ON ITS BUDGET PROPOSAL IN AND AND THERE IS LISTED THE PRIORITIES AT THE TIME AND WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY HERE SO I'M DEFINITELY HERE ON ON YOUR CONCERN ON ON THE THE COMMENTS AND DONATED THINK THAT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE THAT OF OF A OF A LIP. SERVICE IT'S IT DOES COME FROM A GENUINE -- RESPONSE OF IF THIS IS A PRIOR TO THE TIME WHEN I OR INTO BEING ONE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT CREDITS DISTANCE -- BECAUSE TAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HERE TO SIT FOR AN A LIST AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S ALSO HERE. YOUR PRIORITIES SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MS RUBIO -- RYAN THE LAND IS HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARED MEMBERS MILLINERS ILIO -- SO WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE RAISED IN OUR HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET PUBLICATION -- RECENTLY -- TWO PRIMARY ISSUES -- ONE BEING. THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL IMPLEMENTATION AS HAS BEEN ALREADY NOTED -- THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THE BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE GOALS OF CCAR SPONSORED THE GUIDE TO MAKING SURE THAT MORE. CHILDREN ARE IN HOME BASE FAMILY CARE SETTINGS -- AND AS AS ALSO PREVIOUSLY NOTED -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE REMAIN CHALLENGES RELATED -- TO THE APPLICATION APPROVAL TIME. A TIME FRAMES THAT -- FAMILIES HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- INCLUDING -- FOR CAREGIVERS WITH THE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- OVER NINETY DAYS AS REQUIRED -- BY LAW. AND SO GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME MODERATE -- IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAIT TIMES. WE WOULD RECOMMEND NOT ONLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR -- THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT OF CCIR BUT CONSIDER EXTENDING. THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT IT HAS BEEN GIVING TO COUNTIES. TO HELP THEM. IMPLEMENT THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CCAR -- A AND AND BRING THOSE WAIT TIMES DOWN. AS WELL TO CONSIDER -- EXTENDING THE FUNDING FOR THESE PARTICULAR CARE GIVERS WITH THE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- OR HAVING THEIR WELL A APPROVAL WAIT TIMES. GREATER THAN NINETY DAYS -- IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THESE ARE FAMILIES PLACEMENT SETTINGS ARE REMAIN STABLE AND THAT CHILDREN DON'T HAVE -- TO AND UP. OF CHANGING -- THERE CARE GIVERS OF THE OTHER -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT -- IS READ THE CARD TO THE LEVEL OF CARE -- TOOL AND RATE STRUCTURE -- THERE REMAIN SEVERAL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RATHER REGARDING THIS COMPONENT OF CCIR -- THAT IS ALSO EXPERIENCED -- SIGNIFICANT DELAYS -- ONE BEING -- WHAT THE? KIND OF THE LATEST ITERATION OF THAT TO LOOKS LIKE -- AND WHAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS -- INCORPORATING THE INPUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING WITH -- WITH GARDEN THIS TOOL AND WHAT. ANY OUTSTANDING UNCERTAINTIES. REMAIN -- AS THE TOOL -- IS ROLLED OUT TO OTHER. POPULATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE STRUCTURE -- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A BOOK FROM VERY SPECIFIC DETAIL TIMELINE FOR THE ROLL OUT OF THE RATE STRUCTURE -- TO DIFFERENT -- CAREGIVERS OUTSIDE OF THE THE NEW -- FFA -- CARE GIVERS. AND THE DETAILS ON THE PLANNED VALIDITY TEST. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS -- TO CONDUCT ON THE TOOL AS IT'S ROLLED OUT AND HOW IT PLANS TO INCORPORATE -- ANY FINDINGS FROM THAT A TEST -- TO LATER ITERATIONS OF THE TOOL -- AND FINALLY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE -- IT YOU WE THINK IT WOULD BE A WORTHY IF OF THE NEGOTIATION COULD -- OF PROVIDE A KIND OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMBINED THAT FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT -- FOSTER FAMILY HOMES -- WOULD HAVE WHAT'S THE NEW RATE STRUCTURE IS IMPLEMENTED -- COMBINED WITH THE NEW -- SUPPLEMENTAL CARE INCLEMENT PLANS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT THERE MIGHT MAYBE SOME FAMILIES THAT ON THAT HAVE A HIGHER OR LOWER -- RATE OF OF GRANTS COMPARED -- TO THEIR X. WHAT THEY WORKS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING UNDER THE THE OLDER AGE BASED RATE STRUCTURE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE LA -- BEFORE REMOVED TO THE NEXT. ISSUE. ALRIGHT THEN I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT -- JENNIFER REX ROAD -- COME JOIN US PLEASE. AND WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] THIS REYES. MR FRAZIER HAS AN EXCUSED ABSENCE MISTER MATHIS. MISTER PATTERSON. MISTER RAMOS MISS RUBIO. MEET DOCTOR WOULD [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- GENEREX READ WHAT CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CARE GIVERS. AND EXCITE IT'S EXCITING TO BE A PAIR WITH I AM SUCH A HOT ISSUE THAT -- YOU'VE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN. AND I'D DEFINITELY WE FEEL THAT AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME. TO PULL THE RUG OUT -- FROM UNDERNEATH RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES. SO MANY COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED. I'M REALLY IMPORTANT AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING AND FAMILY FINDING ACTIVITIES AND CAMPAIGNS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF SUPPORT GROUP AT TANGIBLE SUPPORT AT PROGRAMS FOR CARE GIVERS INCLUDING. A MENTORING PROGRAMS -- FOSTER PARENT LIAISONS -- RESPITE PROGRAMS AND OTHER TANGIBLE SERVICES THAT MAKE -- PLACEMENTS POSSIBLE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BEFORE INCLUDING -- SIBLING SETS AND OR LARGER SIBLING FATS AND AND OTHER YOUTH WHO ARE STEPPING DOWN FROM CONGREGATE CARE. SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE -- THE TIME THAT THAT FIT BIRDS WAS IMPLEMENTED KIND OF GOT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THAT MONEY WAS DIVERTED -- THROUGH THE WHOLE RFA CRISIS WHICH WAS IMPORTANT BUT NOT REALLY. THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE FUNDING SO SOME OF THE COUNTY IS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS THEM THAT THEY WOULD HAVE -- HAD THEY OTHERWISE NOT HAD TO DETER FOR DIVERT THE FUNDING. SO AB AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN COUNTY IS BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS -- OF THESE PROGRAMS AND OTHER COUNTIES YOU KNOW START. THE SIXTH START DOING SUCCESSFUL ACTIVITIES ARE ACTIVITIES THAT SHOWED -- PROMISE OUR SUCCESS. AND AND SO WE CAN REALLY MEET THAT DEMAND FOR HOMES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T STEP KIDS DOWN. UNLESS WE HAVE FAMILY HOME SETTINGS TO PUT THAT MEANT THANK YOU -- REACTION PLEASE FROM -- FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION -- DEAL F. AND ALEJO. WELL I THINK REALLY BRIEFLY A MEMBER TALKED ABOUT RECRUITMENT IN THE END IN THE PRIOR CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD I MEAN I I WOULD SAY. TO I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO AS YOUR AGENDA DESCRIBED IN THE BACKGROUND WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH ABOUT THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THAT SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR CHILD WELFARE WAS REALIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND ALONG WITH THAT CAME THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAMILY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THAT SAID WE ALSO RECOGNIZE CHANGE IS HARD CHANGES DIFFICULT WE NEED MORE FAMILIES THAT'S WHY THE STATE INVESTED IN THE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE'RE HAPPY AS MS RACKS ROAD AND MISTER MAC OF BEFORE HER -- AND YOUR OWN REQUEST FOR CONVERSATION WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION ME WHAT I DIDN'T JUMP IN AND SAY AT THE TIME. JANUARY TEN WAS RIGHT AFTER JANUARY SIX AND THERE WHILE THE GOVERNOR WEIGHED IN ON PRIORITIES HE DIDN'T HAVE PRIORITIES ON EVERY ISSUE IN THE BUDGET RIGHT. AND SO I'M GONNA. SAY WITHOUT SAYING WHAT I JUST SAID. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU KNOW -- WONDERFUL THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. I THINK MAYBE THE IF I MAY THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO THIS IS THAT -- AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS LIKE THE RFA BACKLOG REDUCTION. WHEN WE PUT MONEY INTO SOMETHING BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET OUT OF THAT INVESTMENT OR WHAT THE PROGRESS OR MILESTONES ARE THAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT TO THE CONVERSATION? THIS ISSUE AGAIN DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ISOLATION MR ROSE TESTIFIED WE'D ALREADY REDUCED A THOUSAND KIDS OUT OF CONGREGATE CARE. MEANING THOSE OF ALREADY GONE SOME PLACE WE HAVE AN RFA -- BACKLOG IN A DELAY IN APPROVALS. ADDRESSING THAT CAN CREATE MORE HOME BASED CARE PLACEMENTS AND FURTHER REDUCING THE NEED FOR SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS AND PIECES WERE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SO FOR SHEER INDULGENCE. AND JUST IN CASE MY BRAIN IT'S AN AND JUST TO ADD ON WITH THE TO BE DIRECTOR TO MAKE IT SAID THE THE THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN ITS FIRST BUDGET IN HHS SO -- BEGIN TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY -- WILL HAPPEN GAUGING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND JUST RECOGNIZE. THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF ALL OF THESE SERVERS AS WE TAKE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER AS WELL. THANK YOU -- THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT POTENTIAL UNSPENT FUNDS. A AND F. P. R. R. S.. CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COUNTIES IN THE ADVOCATES SPEAK TO THIS. AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE PROPOSAL. I THINK I THINK THERE ARE AND IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE CONTRACTS AND SERVICES WERE DELAYED IN THE BEGINNING I WAS ABLE. THERE WAS SOME LAG TIME -- IN SETTING OUT PROGRAMS AND GETTING THE CONTRACTS IN PLACE. AND I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN AS THAT AND BECAUSE COUNTIES NEIL THAT THE PROGRAM -- OR THE FUNDING WAS ENDING THEY STARTED THEY SUCH AN SOME COUNTY IT'S A STARTED TO SCALE BACK -- THE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING -- SO. THAT'S THE BEST I CAN. OFFER. GREG MAY KNOW MORE. LAUREN HUNTER. RIGHT SO I JUST I WITHOUT GREAT RISK IN THE DEPARTMENT I'D ALSO NOTE THAT PREVIOUS YEARS OF UNSPENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN ROLLED OVER AND AVAILABLE THIS YEAR AS WELL SO THE THE THE THE INVESTMENT THE THREE YEAR INVESTMENT THAT WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT EARLIER. HE HAS HAS CARRIED THROUGH YOU KNOW IT SO IT HAS IT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE -- AND SO I WANT YOU. TO SO WOULD YOU ASKED ABOUT THE AND YOU KNOW UNSPENT FUNDS THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR [inaudible] AND I'LL ADD ONE MORE AND PEACE TO THAT I KNOW OF A PROGRAM AND FOR LA PROBATION FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING. AND A VERY -- HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE BASED MARKETING AND RECRUITMENT -- PROGRAM AND THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF RESULTS SO. THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK MAYBE TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET OFF THE GROUND BUT NOW THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED. AND THEY HAVE KIND OF HAVE THIS WAVE OF SUCCESS WHEREAS IF THE PROGRAM. IF THE IF THE FUNDING DOES THAT CONTINUE YOU HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTED. PARTY IS AN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM GOING BUT NO -- NO WAY TO CONTINUE TO KIND OF CAPTURE AND TRAIN AND AND UC'S FAMILY IS FOR PROBATION YOUTH. SO THAT MIGHT BE AN EXAMPLE OF OF HOW THIS. THIS INVESTMENT IF WE IF WE CUT IT OFF RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOSING YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAN A LOSING THAT. THREE YEAR INVESTMENT. CUTE BUT WHEN FINANCE NO COMMENT. BUT I I THINK AGAIN JUST AND REYES FINANCE I THINK WE'VE WE'VE CONTINUED ON WITH THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S AT RESPECT FOR NOT PROVIDING THE SAME RESPONSE -- JUST TO GET OUT ON WITH THAT W. DIRECTOR ROSE SAID WE'VE -- INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WAS LANGUAGE TO RE APPROPRIATE ANY UNSPENT FUNDS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. TO PROVIDED TO COUNTIES FOR ANY OF THOSE UNSPENT FUNDS TO GIVE THEM A LONGER TO USE THOSE -- GOOD [inaudible] HELLO. COMMENTS VERY GOOD. THANK YOU -- ADVOCACY PROPOSAL THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM FERS. CAN WE CALL UP CAN DEREK APRIL [inaudible] GREAT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM TO BE HERE TODAY -- MY NAME'S KEN BERWICK I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES WHERE ONE OF THOSE NINETEEN STI TEEPEES IN THE STATE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST WRAPAROUND PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH JUVENILE JUSTICE AND EDUCATION IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. TO THAT END AND BECAUSE OF THAT WORK WE'VE SEEN UP CLOSE. THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR SERVICE SYSTEM FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES. AND SEEING THOSE GAPS THREE YEARS AGO WE GOT A GRANT FROM THE IRVINE FOUNDATION. TO BRING LEADERS IN THE STATE TOGETHER TO LOOK AT HI NEEDS YOU. AND THE SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD BE MOST IMPACTFUL FOR THOSE WHO. AND AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS WHAT WE SAW IS THAT YOUTH ARE ENDING UP. IN HOSPITALS. IN JUVENILE HALLS. AND HOMELESS. THAT NEVER NEEDED TO BE. AND THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE BECAUSE THERE ARE MOMENTS IN THOSE WHOSE LIFE AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVE. WHERE WE CAN OPTIONALLY INTERVENE USING A MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR TRAJECTORY? THE TRUTH IS I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY S. T. R. T. P. BETS WE NEED IN THE STATE. I DON'T THINK WE KNOW HOW MANY FOSTER VETS WE NEED IN THE STATE BECAUSE UNTIL WE BUILD THAT ARE OUR SYSTEM OF FOSTER CARE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY US T. I. T. PEOPLE AT TWENTY EIGHT AND UNTIL WE BUILD OUTS THAT THINGS LIKE MOBILE RESPONSE. THAT DIVERT KIDS AN OPPORTUNITY MOMENTS INTO AWAY FROM PLACES LIKE HOSPITALS AND GROUP CARE AND INTO MORE -- SUPPORTED HOME BASED SERVICES THEN WE'LL KNOW WHAT WE NEED FOR HIGHER AND SERVICE. WE'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF RUNNING FOR CONTRA COSTA AND SAN FRANCISCO MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN I STARTED I HAD WRITTEN DOWN HERE OF THAT WE'VE SEEN IN 80% DIVERSION RATE BUT OUR CLINICAL DIRECTOR IS HERE TODAY AND SHE REMINDED ME THAT WAS EIGHTY THREE POINT SOMETHING PERCENT. YOU CAN'T FORGET THE DECIMAL POINT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS MORE THAN EIGHT OUT OF TEN KIDS DON'T END UP IN A HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM GOING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK. THEY DON'T END UP IN JUVENILE HALL AND THEY DON'T USE A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER AS THEIR CRISIS COUNSELOR. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM A YOUTH IS IN CRISIS THE PARENT DOESN'T KNOW WHO OR WHAT WHO TO CALL OR HOW TO GET HELP. IN THE END UP COMING INTO A SYSTEM THAT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND TO KEEP THEM OUT OF HIGHER AND SYSTEMS AND PROVIDE SUPPORT. WE'VE DONE SO MUCH IN THE STATE BY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE BY CREATING SYSTEMS TO INTERVENE AND SCHOOLS BY CREATING SYSTEMS THAT CAN INTERVENE EARLIER. THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE OF THE IRVINE GRANT AND TALKING WITH LEADERS AROUND THE STATE ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO DIFFERENTLY I BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO. THAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT AND MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND JOHANNA IS HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS BECAUSE SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. WE CALLED JOHANNA I THINK WE SHOULD. HI JOHANNA OF OUR BREATH MOBILE RESPONSE TEAM SENECA. AND I PARTICULARLY TRIED TO USE ONLY TWO MINUTES THAT I'D LEAVE YOU A MINUTE OR SO TO ASK QUESTIONS. DOMINANCE HOW MY PROGRAM. SO WE'VE BEEN RUNNING OUR PROGRAMS ARE IT WOULD YOU GAVE YOU MADE IT FOR THE HARSH AS I THOUGHT ARE COMING UP FOR ONE MINUTE TO TELL US NUMBER. SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN RUNNING A PROGRAM FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS IN OUR COUNTY -- WHICH IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT A REALLY LONG TIME TO BE RUNNING A PROGRAM HALF OF OUR STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS WHICH IS WHILE CONSIDERING THAT IT'S MENTAL HEALTH IT'S COMMUNITY BASED AND IT'S CRISIS WORK -- I THINK THE BEAUTY OF OUR PROGRAM IS THAT WE'RE JUST REALLY ABLE TO SERVE. FAMILIES AT A TIME THAT'S CONVENIENT FOR THEM AT THEIR HOME ADD IN A SPACE THAT'S COMING UP FOR THEM IN THEIR LANGUAGE -- IT'S REALLY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RESPONDING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES -- REALLY THERE TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM AND REALLY SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHAT WE DO HAVE A GREAT DIVERSION RATE IT WE DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DIVERT BUT WE DO GET TO HELP -- CHANCE FOR THEM TO THE HOSPITAL BE WITH THEM THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND REALLY SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE FOLLOW UP SERVICES IF THEY NEED ANY -- SO THE CONFLICT OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE DO -- HAPPY AND IF IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE IN MOST OF OUR COUNTY STACK PROVIDES PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND MOST OF OUR CAN AS WE DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING LEVEL RESPONSE. AND SO WHAT WE SEE IS A CYCLE WHETHER WHERE EITHER POLICE OR SOMETIMES MENTAL HEALTH AND BEING. A CHILD ENDS UP IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL USUALLY THOSE WAIT TIMES WHEN SOMEBODY'S IN THE KID PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS. IS OUR FOUR SIX EIGHT AT THE I'VE HEARD NIGHTMARE STORIES OF MUCH LONGER YOU KNOW THE STORIES -- OFTEN ARE TEENAGERS SIMPLY WALK OUT. THEY DON'T EVEN WAIT TO GET HELP. THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO. WORST CASE SCENARIOS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CALLED. THE SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT TAKES THEM DOWN THAT TRAJECTORY AND THEY'RE IN JUVENILE HALL AND THEN IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT OR IN A GROUP HOME. OF AT AND AND SO MANY OF THOSE SITUATIONS ARE UNNECESSARY. SO MANY OF THE SITUATIONS WHEN WE GET TENER BEING AT THE OPTIMAL POINT. CAN PROVIDE THE PIVOT POINT THAT ALLOWS US TO KEEP KIDS AT HOME OR IN A FOSTER HOME. OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE COMMUNITY -- I KNOW THAT THE SO WE HAVE MANY SOCIAL WORKERS HERE AT THE CAPITOL FOR THEIR LOBBY DAY. AND THEY HAVE SHARED THE TO WHAT A NIGHTMARE FOR THEM IS TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND TO HAVE A PARENT SAY. I'VE GIVEN UP ON GIVING MY CHILD TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GET OUT OF HERE -- THE AFTER OUR CHILDREN YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCES TRAUMA FROM. TO BE PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT AND I THINK THAT THIS FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- WE WE NEED TO PRESERVE THE PLACEMENT. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND NOT FOR THE TRAUMATIZED THAT FOSTER YOUTH. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT AND I I SINCERELY APPRECIATE -- THE COMP YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL -- TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE THAT WE HAVE LOTS OF FOSTER YOUTH. THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE THEY WERE ALL HOLDING UP THEIR SIGNS TO HOW MANY TIMES HAVE BEEN PLACED [inaudible] FOURTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE THIS THIS IS WE ALL LIKED WE ALL AGREE THIS IS ALL. UNACCEPTABLE HAVING A HOTLINE HAVING DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ARE OUR CHILDREN TO KEEP THEM FROM. BEING FURTHER TRAUMATIZED AND TO FIGURE OUT TO DATE DOING THE THE TRIAGE. TO FIND OUT THE TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM HOSPITALS -- IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I KNOW THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA -- THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF HIS TOP PRIORITIES AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY. FOR FOR THIS FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- I THINK CREATING THIS NURTURING ENVIRONMENT JUST AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE A PRE PLACEMENT. VISIT THE TO MAKE YOU DO WITH THE PARENTS SO THAT THE PARENTS THEN KNOW WHO CAN SUPPORT THEM TELL US ABOUT THAT WE DO WE'VE RECEIVER FARRELL'S FROM A VARIETY OF PLACES WE HAVE A PRETTY. AWESOME RELATIONSHIP BUT OUR LOCAL THANK EMERGENCY SERVICE AND SO KIDS THAT GO THROUGH THERE THAT AREN'T FULLY LINKED ON WE GET ALL THEIR DISCHARGE PAPERWORK AND WERE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO THEM -- AND I WOULD SAY ABOUT 20% OF OUR YOUTH ARE FOSTER YOUTH RIGHT NOW BUT WE GET TO CALL. THE FAMILY SAY HEY WE UNDERSTANDING JUST WENT THROUGH THIS CRISIS CAN WE COME OUT THERE INTRODUCED OUR SERVICE TO YOU IF THIS WAS THE COME UP AGAIN HOW CAN WE SUPPORT YOU WHAT OTHER. RESEARCH CAN PROVIDE FOR YOU WE ALSO GET REFERRALS FROM TEACHERS SOCIAL WORKERS -- LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES LONG PERSONAL WHAT THE HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO AND SO THEY ACTUALLY REFER TO US -- A FEW MONTHS AGO THERE WAS A WOMAN. WHO ARE HER SON WAS HAVING A TANTRUM IN THE STORE AND ANOTHER PARENT SAID TO HER HATE CALL THESE PEOPLE THEY CAN HELP YOU AND SO THAT'S MY MOST PROUDEST REFERRAL THAT WE'VE GOT IN -- BUT WE DEFINITELY CAN THEN REACH OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES AND SAY -- YOU KNOW WE WE HEARD ABOUT YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM OUR SERVICES CAN COME OUT AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES -- WE FIND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT INITIAL ASSESSMENT WERE ABLE -- TO IT'S LIKE A WARM HAND OFF AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO UTILIZE US DURING A CRISIS. THANK YOU WERE PLAYING MUSICAL CHAIRS. ACTUALLY THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE BEEN THAT WAY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR OF FLEXIBILITY HERE -- SOUL ANY REACTION OR FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE ALEJO. I'D SAY THE GREG ROSE AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY WERE AWARE OF THESE TYPES OF SERVICES -- AND PROGRAMS AND IN OTHER STATES AND AND IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND I THINK THAT THE KEY FOR US IS THAT THE KEY FOR ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT IS. HOW WE GO ABOUT HOW IMPLEMENTATION AGO ABOUT IT MANY OF THE PLACES I'M AWARE IT ARE RIGHT OUR SMALL SMALLER -- JURISDICTIONS AND DO WE DO HAVE. URBAN AND RURAL AND DISTANCE AND A NUMBER OF THINGS TO CONSIDER BUT WE ARE IN FACT AWARE OF OF OF THE UTILITY OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND WE'VE SEEN THEM IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AND IF I MAY THE ALLEN BEATS SO WAS ONE OF THE ENGINEERS OF THE NEW JERSEY SYSTEM WHICH IS ACTUALLY A LARGER MORE SKILLED SYSTEM AND HE WORKED. WITH US ON SOME OF THE IDEAS AROUND CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM AND HOW IT CAN BE SCALED -- MOBILE RESPONSE ACTUALLY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH IS IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM AT SCALE THE THE SMALLER IT IS THE MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE AVAILABILITY. AND AN UNUSED AVAILABILITY IS REALLY EXPENSIVE. SO SO TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU CAN HAVE DEPTH IN TEAMS TO RESPOND TO A BROADER AREA YOU DO GET. NOT JUST SMALL ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUT BIG ECONOMIES OF SCALE AROUND THE INITIAL RESPONSE ESPECIALLY SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT REALLY WORK ABOUT A STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT IN THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE RUNNING. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT. JUSTIN PRENTICE BERMAN FINANCE -- AS WITH ALL THE PROPOSALS ARE WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON ANY OF THEM AT THIS TIME -- SO AGAIN. TO THE EXTENT IT'S PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WERE HAPPY. TO ENGAGE WITH ON THE DON'T. THANK YOU FOR THE LAST YOU HEAR THAT [inaudible] ELIA. THANK YOU RIGHT WELL THANK YOU AND THEN I'LL GOING TO COLLAPSE -- SUSAN AND IF [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND WE'LL BE DISCUSSING CONTINUED EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION EARLIER BETWEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO IN THE STATE -- US ALL OF THE LA US COMMENTS HIM TO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE FUNDING -- AS A STATE MANSION LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION CAME TOGETHER HEN THEY STAND A CRISIS. AND YOUR FOR YOUR FUNNY AT THE TIME A PLACEMENT HAS JUST BEEN A LIFESAVER. FOR TEN THOUSAND THE FAMILY TO ME JUST SO MANY FOLKS ON WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HOWEVER WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMING YEAR. SO IN THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE AT NINETY DAYS ISSUE NOTED THE STATE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE THERE AND SO. IN THE LEGISLATION WE NOW CUT OFF THAT FUNDING IT NINETY DAYS STARTING ON JUNE THIRTIETH. AND THERE'S ALSO NO GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION ANYMORE SO ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AND ALL THIS GOOD NEWS THAT THE STATE GAVE YOU. ALL ENDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH. SAYS ADVOCATES WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY WHO WORK WITH US TO CONTINUE THE AMAZING WORK THAT HAPPENED. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXTEND TO AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY DAYS. BECAUSE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS THE CURRENT AVERAGE. SAID ANYTHING BELOW THAT REALLY IS GOING TO PUT FAMILIES AT RISK WE ALSO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE GOOD BECAUSE EXEMPTION WOULD NEED THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FAMILIES THAT. FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL IT GOES PAST THAT THEY CAN'T JUST LOSE FUNDING OVER THINGS THAT ARE NOT UNDER THEIR CONTROL. IT HARMS NOT ONLY THESE FAMILIES BUT ALSO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT BECAUSE I'M -- AS WE SPOKE EARLIER -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY NOW WE HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT AGAIN PUTTING IN DANGER THOSE FAMILIES.

ABSOLUTELY AND APPRECIATE THE EGG KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THEIR EARLIER CONVERSATION I MEAN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AREA WHERE A CONVERSATION AMONGST MULTIPLE GROUPS GROUPS AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE. RESULTED IN A GOOD SOLUTION TO A KNOWN PROBLEM THE WORLD'S DYNAMIC -- AS WITH MANY THINGS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND YOU KNOW -- IN THE THERE'S AN UNWRITTEN RULE SOMEWHERE THAT IF IF I TOLD YOU -- THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT ISSUES FROM REVISION -- THAT THAT WOULD BE A FAUX PAS SO I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT. HELLO BUT I WOULD IN NO WAY TEN I DIDN'T HEAR -- BUT YET BUT BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY -- AS I MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T WEIGH IN ON C. C. R. NOGEN TEN PROPOSAL SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATION NOW THAT HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A FEW MONTHS PERHAPS IT'S A TIME. FOR YOU KNOW FOR HIM TO TAKE A BETTER LOOK AT WHAT'S I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT HE'D BE INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT OUT BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW AT WE I WANT TO AGAIN COMPLIMENT.

ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE ALEJO DEPARTMENT. RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND TRANSPORTATION OKAY MORE MOVING ON TO TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL AND OR OR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN AT TIME OF PLACEMENT -- KRISTIN POWER. AND JORDAN SOSA THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KRISTIN POWER FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS I WE TRUE WE APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION OF FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT. AND THIS ITEM IS RELATED TO THAT -- THIS IS FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION TO THE SCHOOL BOARD CHEN. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RIGHT THE CHILD IN FOSTER CARE HAS IS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN. AND TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET TO THAT SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL BOARD IN RIGHTS. ARE IMPLEMENTED WE MUST HAVE FUNDING REIMBURSEMENTS THE CARE GIVER FOR TRANSPORTING THAT. CHILD TO THE SCHOOL THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE EXISTING IS THE CARE GIVERS ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO A SCHOOL BOARD AND ONCE THEY'RE APPROVED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY. RELATIVES AN EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS GENERALLY ACCEPT PLACEMENT OF A CHILD BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN APPROVED AS YOU HAVE THAT PREVIOUS DISCUSSION TODAY. AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS LENGTHY AND WE KNOW IT'S AVERAGING AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS CURRENTLY. A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IS AND CAN BE THE MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. FAMILIES CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND WITHOUT FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO COVER THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION IT'S OFFICE UNTENABLE FOR THE FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. AND TRANSPORT THAT CHILD AT THE SCHOOL BOARD CHEN. WHEN WE SPEAK -- TO HOW IMPORTANT SCHOOL CONNECTIONS ARE AND THIS FUNDING MAKES THAT STABILITY A REALITY. WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BUDGET PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRANSPORTING A CHILD THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN IS INITIATED AT THAT TIME OF PLACEMENTS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JORDAN SOSA I'M ALL OF FORMER FOSTER YOU FROM LAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I SERVE AT THE STATE WHY POLICY COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. OF BEFORE JUST PROVIDE THE PROVIDING MATHIS MONEY I LIKE TO THINK -- SHEA HOUSE AND MY SISTER ANNA SOSA FOR OPENING MY EYES TO THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS MANY YOUTH PHASE OF UP FROM INSTABILITY WITHIN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIA'S TROUBLE FOR SYSTEM EXPERIENCE BOTH PLACEMENT AND EDUCATIONAL STABILITY AND IT'S FAR TOO COMMON HEARING THE LACK THE PERMANENCY OF OUR YOUTH EXPERIENCE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM. WE ALWAYS HEAR THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF THE EDUCATIONAL. OUTCOMES FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND ONLY 3% OF GRADUATE FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RESEARCH STATES THE EDUCATIONAL DISPARITY BETWEEN FOSTER YOUTH AND THE GENERAL POPULATION IS DUE TO THE EDUCATIONAL INSTABILITY FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT. OF MULTIPLE PLACEMENT CHANGES EVEN THOUGH I MOVED TO MULTIPLE HOMES AND FAMILIES AND FOSTER CARE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO STAY IN THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE SAME STORY FOR MY THREE YOUNGER SISTERS WHO ARE STILL LIVING IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. I HAVE TO WITNESS MY SISTERS MOVED FROM ONE HOME TO ANOTHER BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS LET THEM DOWN. ST I HAD THE WITNESS SAYING THERE SEE AND SAYING THEIR GOODBYES BECAUSE OF THE SEVEN DAY NOTICE ACTING ALL THEIR BELONGINGS AND SEVEN DAYS AND QUESTIONING IF THEY WERE LOVED OR WANTED WHICH IS THE QUESTION THAT WILL LAST LONGER THAN SEVEN DAYS. WITH THIS WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR BUDGET PROPOSAL TO RAISE TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION A CHILD TO THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN IS INITIATED AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT SO THAT OUR YOUTH CAN THRIVE. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND ONE HOME AND ONE SCHOOL. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS WE'LL. I THINK OUR PRIOR REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE BEFORE AFTER APPROVAL NEED SUPPORT -- SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. THANK YOU I'M DO. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATE FOR THE PROPOSAL -- AND LET ME JUST KIND OF ELABORATE ON THAT SO WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH EARLIER ABOUT THE THE GREAT. JOB THAT WE'VE DONE AND APPROVING THE FAMILIES -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO ENTER IN THE INTERIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE FAMILIES ARE RECEIVING THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND AGAIN DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATE. SO I ARE ALIVE YOU SPEAK TO THE ASPECT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY SEEN IT SO I I'M NOT QUALIFIED PROBABLY TO TALK ABOUT IT I WILL TELL YOU THAT SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WAS REALIGNED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO COUNTIES SO STATE VISIBILITY INTO EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING SPENT TODAY AND HOW. MUCH A CASE COSTS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. JUST IMPRISONMENT FINANCE WHO I BELIEVE -- THERE'S ALSO COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT'S RELATED TO THAT SO I THINK IT'S A ASSEMBLY BILL -- THREE THREE SEVEN AND AND FINANCES -- I BELIEVE OUR ANALYSIS MIGHT BE OUT I'M NOT SURE BUT I THERE MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS WITH THE THE ACTUAL LAST IMMINENT -- WE HAVEN'T REALLY DUG DEEP INTO EVERYTHING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CASELOAD IS AND BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO THIS SOME. OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS -- FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE APPROVED IN YOUR FUNDING AMOUNT IS DEPENDENT UPON YOUR MILEAGE FROM THE HOME. OR IF -- IT'S A A MONTHLY BUS STIPEND AND SO ON SO. THE SIMPLE ANSWER FOR YOU IS -- WE'RE NOT SURE IF THAT'S THE CORRECT ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S TO HIRE IF IT'S TOO LOW -- BUT THERE ARE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VARIABLES TO LOOK INTO ON THAT -- SO. I I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY -- BUT BUT WE I I I CAN DOUBLE CHECK FOR YOU AND FIND OUT OF OUR ANALYSIS IS PUBLIC RIGHT AND AND AND HOW. NOT ONLY -- IF THE ANALYSIS IS CORRECT BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DETERMINE. IF IT IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS A A KIND OF AN ACCOUNTING TYPE OF ISSUE WELL IT'S JUST IT'S LIKE USUAL EVERYTHING IS AN ESTIMATE FOR ITS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE CASE THAT IS GOING TO BE AWARE YOUTH MAY. NOT BE PLACED -- GETS A ONE BY ONE TIME A YOUTH COULD POTENTIALLY BE PLACED. THREE MILES FROM -- THEIR SCHOOL BOARD CHEN AND THEN A NEW PLACE SPENDING GREG IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. THEY COULD BE PLACED SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S TEN MILES AWAY SO -- WE WE DO TAKE AND ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS WITH WORKING WITH -- THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE TRY TO COME UP WITH THAT CEMENT SO YOU'RE CORRECT THERE'S NO. PERFECT POINT WE CAN SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO TO GIVE AN ACCURATE OR A BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE MAKE OUR ANALYSES. REGRETS THE DEPARTMENT I JUST SAY TO HISTORICALLY WHAT WE DO WE OFTEN DO IS LOOK AT PREVIOUS EXPENDITURES FOR A SIMILAR -- POPULATIONS OF THE FOR THOSE APPROVED VERSES THE OF FOLKS THAT ARE TO PROVE WE COULD LOOK WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE PREVIOUS EXPENDITURES. AS AS AS MISTER SPEAKER JUST SAID -- SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE OF REALIGNMENT THAT THE PRECISION OF THE OF KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT WAS SPENT -- IS IS A LITTLE LESS PRECISE THAN IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN BUT THERE ARE SOME. WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD PARTNER WITH FINANCE AND THE ADVOCATES TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH TO ME I WOULD HOPE SO. THANK YOU. IF YOU COULD YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO THIS IF WE CAN'T -- PROVIDE THE THE MONEY IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE GOING TO NEED FOR IT SO. THAT OUR FAMILY FOUNDER COUNTIES TO BE HELPFUL AND COLLECTING DATA OR SURVEY IN A COUPLE SELECT COUNTIES FOR US TO HELP ENABLE THOSE ESTIMATES. THAT ALWAYS A GROUP EFFORT ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT. ALL OF YOUR PARTICIPATION AND YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A GREAT CONVERSATION TO HAVE -- PLEASE EXPECT MORE CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS -- ALSO -- THERE'S ONE LAST YOU SHOULD LIKE TO RAISE IN REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT LANGUAGE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN STAFF HAS INFORMED ME THAT ARE AT WORK TO UPDATE AND CODIFY THIS LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INITIATED AND I AGREE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ADOPT THIS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET -- THANK YOU TO THE LA -- FOR GREEN TO WORK WITH US ON THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING A PRODUCT AND THIS IS I BET. ACTUAL PRODUCT THAT WE CAN TAKE ACTION ON AS WE CLOSE OUT THE ME REVISION HEARING AND SOMEONE NEXT MONTH AND IT'S APRIL. I'M FOR AYE IT HOW IT IS IT APRIL TENTH IS.

THANK YOU JESSICA BARTH UP ON THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ON COMMENT ONE AA. WITH REGARDS. TO TO READ AT BRINGING FOSTER YOUTH AND FINDING FAT AND FAMILIES FOR THEM TO BE WITH A WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN SERVING FAMILIES -- WITH -- YOUTH WHO ARE IN -- WHO'VE GONE TO JUVENILE HALL OR HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATIVE OF CRIME WE'VE IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE WITH -- WELL FOR INSTITUTIONS CODE WHICH ALLOWS FOR RESTITUTION TO BE CHARGED TO A GUARDIAN. AND AND THAT MEANS THAT WHEN. YOU HAVE A YOUTH WITH A YOU WITH AN EDUCATION. THEIR FAMILIES EXTENDED FAMILIES -- OR FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE THEM INTO THEIR HOME IF THEY THEN HAVE TO PAY THE RESTITUTION OF THE YOUTH -- FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND SO THAT THE LAW IS VERY OLD. IT -- IT SAYS THAT FOSTER PARENTS ARE EXEMPT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO ALSO EIGHT BE INCLUSIVE OF A GUARDIAN TYPE PERSON A NON PARENT -- AND SO WE WOULD WE WOULD ASKED FOR SOME CONSIDERATION OF CHANGE OF THAT RULE WE'LL SEND YOU AN EMAIL AS FOLLOW UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CNN FMI CHILDREN NOW HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ALL THE ITEMS THERE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN BUT PRIMARILY FOR THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM.

THIS IS ALSO ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVING SOMEONE THAT THEY CAN CALL WHEN THEY'RE FRUSTRATED ABOUT THE SITUATION THE HOME OR DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET HELP A YOUNG PERSON CAN ALSO CALL THIS LINE.

IS INDUCED AND SO WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ALL WHEN A REGISTER SUPPORT -- FOR THE PROPOSAL TO NOT REDUCE THE RFA ALLOCATION AS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUDGET BY TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT WILL GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE ON TO ISSUE TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AMONG FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ADVOCACY PROPOSAL I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP -- DETAILS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY FOSTER YOUTH AT AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THAT JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES OF THE VIEW [inaudible] AND YEAH AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S CURRENTLY THERE THANK YOU. YES SHARE WITH ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. TRAVELED FROM CHICO AND MERCED AND ALL AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL OUT OF ORDER. IT MEANS A LOT TO THEM AND TO US THANK YOU. MY NAME IS AMY LEVEL IAN AT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF HIS STATEWIDE COALITION. OF OVER TWO WOULD ORGANIZATIONS TO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE STATE'S TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. KNOWN AS TEACH PEOPLE US. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE CREATED TEACH PEOPLE US IN TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE MOST RISK IT RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR IT PROVIDED SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. YOUTH AND THEIR FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT CHILDREN. WHEN CALIFORNIA EXTENDED FOSTER CARE TO AGE TWENTY ONE IN? TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE POPULATION SERVED BY TEACH PEOPLE PLUS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY. INSTEAD OF LARGELY SERVING EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS THP PLUS NOW SERVES OLDER MORE VULNERABLE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. THIS INCLUDES PRIMARILY CUSTODIAL PARENTS AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES. TEACH PEOPLE ALSO SERVES AS A VALUABLE SAFETY NET FOR A NOT SMALL BUT LARGELY INVISIBLE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THIS IS A GROUP THAT WE WE VERY RARELY SPEAK OF AND UTILIZE TEACH PEOPLE IT'S CONSIDERABLY. THIS PROGRAM IS BEEN EVALUATED EVERY YEAR SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIX A CONSISTENTLY FOUND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH NOTABLY IN AREAS OF HOUSING STABILITY MONTHLY EARNINGS AND EMPLOYMENT. SO CLEARLY THIS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE STATE PROGRAM. HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS PROGRAM IS AT RISK. THE STATE BUDGET FOR TEACH PEOPLE PLUS HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DURING THE SAME SENSE THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE COST OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA. HAS INCREASED BY 50%. SO NOT SURPRISINGLY AS THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS SKYROCKETED SO HAS DEMAND FOR THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM. WE DID A MOMENT IN TIME SNAPSHOT IN A AND IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN ELIGIBLE YOUTH WAITING TO ENTER TEACH PEOPLE PLUS. LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES EACH HAD A WAITING LIST OF OUR FIFTY YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN OVER HALF OF WHO ARE CUSTODIAL PARENTS. THESE ARE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO WERE IN CARE UNTIL AGE. EIGHTEEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE PERMANENCE AND NOW FIND THEMSELVES YOU DON'T. SEVERAL YEARS AFTER HOMELESS. SO THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL IS AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TEACH PEOPLE US. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF THIS VITAL SAFETY NET PROGRAM IT WOULD ALSO SLIGHTLY MODIFIED THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM REALLY IT'S CLOSING MORE OF A OF A LOOPHOLE. CURRENTLY TO BE IN THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO BE IN CARE AT AGE EIGHTEEN IT WOULD SLIGHTLY MODIFY THE PROGRAM SO THAT IF YOU WERE IN CARE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IF YOU LATER BECAME HOMELESS YOU COULD. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CHEAT PERMITS DURING THAT TWO YEAR WINDOW. HOWEVER THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE LARGELY THE SAME EXPERIENCE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REMAINING CARE TELL EIGHTEEN AND YET WE CUT OFF ACCESS TO THIS VITAL PROGRAM. AND WE ACTUALLY CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR PERMANENCE. SO THIS IS A VERY LONG STANDING SUCCESSFUL STATE PROGRAM THAT IS REALLY OFFERED A BETTER BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THOUSANDS OF FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE STRONGLY URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO INTRODUCE J. T. WHO IS THE CURRENT PARTICIPANTS. GOOD AFTERNOON PHONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S J. T. OF TWENTY YEARS OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. SEXY COLLEGE ON A PARTICIPATING. A DOUBLES TSC PLUS PROGRAM.

TWENTY ONE BEING IN FOSTER CARE IS DIFFICULT WHO'S PRETTY STABLE UNTIL THE AGE OF TWELVE WHEN I MOVED FROM PLACEMENT A PLACEMENT LIVING IN SOLANO COUNTY. COUNTER CUSTER. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THESE MOVES MADE A HARD FOR ME TO TRUST MANY PEOPLE EXCEPT A LOT OF THINGS WELL GONNA. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY MY FOSTER MOM WAS EVICTED FROM ROMAN -- QUOTE AND SHE TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T MOVE WITH HER I WAS HOMELESS AND LIVING LIVING WITH MY FRIENDS ON A COACH IS. DURING THIS TIME OF I WAS CALLING SHOULDERS AND OTHER PROGRAMS FINALLY HAVE FOUND THE PROGRAM. ADOLFO. SINCE ARRIVING AT A DOUBLE THEY'VE HELPED ME. PROACTIVELY. MOVE ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH MY LIFE AND NOW LIVING IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND CREATING A POSITIVE FUTURE FOR MYSELF. ALSO A DOVE LESS HELP ME GET A JOB AS A TEACHER'S AIDE TO POUR MY DREAM OF BEING AN ARTIST. THEY'VE PROVIDED ME VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE HELP WITH CERTAIN CERTAIN THINGS IN OUR SUPPLIES TRANSFERRED MY OUR DEFENSE WAS Y. DISPLAYED MORE WORK AND SOLD MY PAINTINGS.

ADULTS WILL HELP ME APPLY IN COMPLETE MY FAST FOOD UNTIL -- A MUCH FASTER MY FINANCIAL AID OPTIONS IN CONNECT WITH OTHER FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS EVEN PAID FOR MY STUDENT FEES. THEY'RE ALWAYS ENCOURAGING SUPPORTIVE SUPPORTIVE AND HELPED ME MAINTAIN MY PASS AND GOALS. ALSO THEY'RE VERY PATIENT WHEN THINGS GET HARD FOR ME IN THE PAST I'VE HAD I'VE HAD STRUGGLED BUT HAVING THEIR SUPPORT HAS HELPED ME. WELL BETTER THAN. I'VE DONE BEFORE I HAVE ADHD WHICH REQUIRED A LOT OF PATIENTS THEY HAVE CONNECTING WITH GOOD THERAPISTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. THIS SUPPORT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND ALSO ARE TO DEVELOP. ESPECIALLY AS A FORMER FOSSIL WHO HAS BEEN A SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT TEARS YOU PLUS I PROBABLY HOMES. AND I'D STILL BE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AND FOCUS ON HOME. THEY'VE HELPED ME FOCUS ON WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESS IN. MORE OF FOSTER YOUTH IN. CALIFORNIA NEED NEED THIS HELP SO I STRONGLY AGREE THROUGH. TO URGE THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE STATE AS RUMORS HE BERMAN LIKES A LOT TO TAKE IN BUT LIKE. I REALLY THINK THAT LIKE THE TEARS HE PLACES WITH IT'S A REALLY IT'S A REALLY. GOOD THING N. ANYTHING THAT'S FOR ITS HELPFUL SO. IN IS A LOT OF OTHER. YOU'VE BETTER LIKE IN THE SAME POSITION AS ME LIKE THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AT SCHOOL AND STUFF BUT LIKE. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS HELP LIKE A HELP US GAIN AN IDEA -- SO. ANY SUPPORT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT SO I RECOMMENDED. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING YOUR TESTIMONY -- IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED. GIVE ALL THE THE THE THE REST OF US TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE. BUT WHEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THE SYSTEM HAS EXPERIENCED IT THE GOOD AND THE BAD CAN COME IN AND TALK TO US. MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE A CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING AT SAID -- SEX CITY. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THE BEGINNING RIGHT YEAH THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT IN YOUR YOUR SON. EVEN A SON WITH YOU. HOW DID YOU SAY YOU HAVE A SON NO NO? EVER BRING A PIECE OF HIS ARTWORK BUT WE WERE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO BRING IT UP WE'RE NOT. I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT. ALL RIGHT WELL WONDERFUL I I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM DSS AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ESTIMATES OF THE PROPOSAL DO UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. A JET GENERAL MARK THAT RIGHT SO -- SHE SHE WILL ALLUDED TO CHANGING A LITTLE BIT THE ELIGIBILITY IN A PROGRAM AS I'VE SAID A COUPLE TIMES TODAY ALREADY THE CHILD WELFARE WAS A REAL LINE PROGRAM THIS IS ONE OF THOSE REALIGNED PROGRAM FUNDING. OUR AVAILABILITY OF DATA IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED TO EVALUATE A REQUEST. IT'S NO SECRET IN CALIFORNIA THE SUPPLY AND COST OF HOUSING IS A MAJOR BARRIER FACED BY WHO -- MAYBE MORESO BY FOSTER YOUTH AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THAN ANY OTHER POPULATION. IN THE STATE A G. BEING AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE GENERALLY MEANS PURSUIT OF WORK OR EDUCATION BOTH OF WHICH ARE WORTH SUPPORTING -- SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A WAY TO TELL YOU EIGHT MILLION IS THE RIGHT NUMBER FIVE MILLIONS OF RIGHT NUMBER TEN MILLION SO RIGHT NUMBER I DON'T THINK IT WE CAN OFFER. IN ON THAT BUT I THINK YOU YOU AS YOU AS YOU YOURSELF JUST SAID IT WE TALKED EARLIER YOU KNOW THE USE VOICE TALKING ABOUT THEIR LIFE YOU DON'T COMPETE WITH THAT STORY AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM. AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE YOUTH PARTICIPATING IN IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE SPACE BAR FINANCE OF WHILE YOU WERE JUGGLING YOUR MANY HATS EARLIER -- JUST MADE A BLANKET STATEMENT FOR FINANCE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY POSITION ON ANY OF THE AFRICAN PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. DOES THE NUMBER OF HERE CORRECT TO YOU THOUGH. FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE WITHOUT GIVING IT AN OPINION A WAS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOOD FOR OR NOT BUT TO PART OF THAT WOULD BE WHY WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON IT -- THE ONLY THING I CAN REITERATING AGAIN IS THE SAME THING THAT THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THANK YOU THAT THAT -- THE THE PROGRAM THAT IS REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THIS IT WAS REALIGNED AS A PART OFTHE TWO THOUSAND AND REALIGNMENT SO -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS AND THAT BEING -- PRIORITY ANY GENERAL FUND -- ERR ANY WHETHER IT'S A BUDGET PROPOSAL OR LEGISLATION THERE ON THAT'S A GENERAL FUND -- RESOURCES WOULD BE NECESSARY. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WHO IS. THE BUDGET CHAIR -- DOES HAVE A BILL IN THIS IN THIS AREA. WONDERFUL COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ON ISSUE. THREE ALL RIGHT WE UNDERSTAND THAT LIBERTY SONGES IS TAKING KATHY'S PLACE. AND YOUR CAR A CARSON. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. MISTER CURRY HERE [inaudible] YES OKAY. ISSUE THREE PROMOTING HOUSING STABILITY FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LIBBY SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF A C. R. U. CALIFORNIA ALSO PRETENDING TO BE KATHY SUDDENLY MCDONALD TODAY SAME CURLS DIFFERENT COLOR -- SO AB TWELVE IS ONE OF OUR PROUDEST ACHIEVEMENTS THE LEGISLATURE'S -- OUR SOCIAL WORKERS -- COUNTY PARTNERS AND ALL OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES PARTNERS AT A SHINING MOMENT RATE OF OF PROGRAM THAT REALLY REALLY WORKS AND WE HAVE. REALLY VERIFIABLE OUTCOME MARKERS THAT WE CAN POINT TO WE KNOW THAT AB TWELVE YOUTH -- PARTICIPANTS SEE BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES BETTER -- WORK OUTCOMES AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES OVERALL -- WHAT WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT TEN YEARS AND TO THE PROGRAM IS THAT THERE ARE SOME UNANTICIPATED THINGS THAT LEAD US TO BE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING? ON WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW GREAT OF A TAKE OPERATE THERE WAS GOING TO BE -- IN THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT A NEED THAT WAS FOR THIS PROGRAM FOR YOUTH. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE NOR DID WE UNDERSTAND REALLY THE INTRICACIES INVOLVED IN EACH CASE -- THE WORKLOAD INVOLVED IN EACH CASE AND THE NEEDS OF THESE YOUTH MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN IN CARE THEIR WHOLE LIVES -- HAVE GONE FROM PLACEMENT TO PLACEMENT AND SO THE VERY -- BASIC THINGS THAT I THINK MANY OF US WHO ARE PARENTS AND ARE TRANSITIONING THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE AGE -- ARE ABLE TO HELP OUR KIDS WITH. THESE KIDS NEED EXTRA CARE EXTRA TIME -- EXTRA RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE STABLE AND SITUATED -- SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A FEW THINGS THE FIRST OF WHICH IS WERE ASKING FOR THIRTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. FOR CASELOAD WE ARE HAVING -- AS WE MENTIONED A HUGE TAKE UP RATE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND EACH CASE IS REALLY REALLY LABOR INTENSIVE SO THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE SOCIAL WORKERS. I'M ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME ON ALL OF THESE CASES IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME HOUSING TRANSITION DOLLARS WERE ASKING FOR HOUSING NAVIGATORS ON THOSE BUT WE YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS HOUSING CRUNCH WE'RE ALL AWARE OF AND REALLY REALLY HARD WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. AND NOT A LOT OF RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE TO BE ABLE TO FIND AN APARTMENT AND THE PLACEMENT AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR FUNDING FOR THAT WERE ALSO LOOKING FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THINGS LIKE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- TO HELP TRANSITION SO -- I WANTED TO FOR THE REST OF MY TIME TO MR CARSON WHO HAS SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH BEING AN A. B.

I'VE BEEN A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THE FIRST PLACE FOR YOU FOR THREE YEARS NOW THE FIRST WITH YOU BY MY OWN APARTMENT THE ROOMMATE WHO'S ALSO IN PROGRAM AND HAVE A SUPPORT TEAM. WHICH INVOLVES MY YOUTH ADVOCATE IN MY EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SPECIALISTS. GROWN UP ON NEW THERE WE WERE AND ALWAYS WILL BE UPS AND DOWNS AND FOR ME I'VE ENCOUNTERED SOME CHALLENGES DURING MY TIME IN PROGRAM. THERE'S A TIME IN MY LIFE AND I HAD GOT INVOLVED WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T SUCH A GOOD INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE AND WE'RE HELPING ME GROW. I WAS LIVING IN OAKLEY IN FIRST PLACE WITH YOU AND IT'S HOT AT TIMES THE NEGATIVE SITUATIONS I WAS INVOLVED WE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE COPS HAD TO BE INVOLVED. AND I WAS EVEN AT RISK OF GETTING KICKED OUT OF PROGRAM TO BE AN OTTOMAN ON MY YOUTH ADVOCATE DIDN'T GIVE UP ON SHE PUSHED HARD FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO STAND PROGRAM EVEN THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS WITH THE POLICE. NOT ONLY DID SHE FIVE FOR ME SHE ALSO WORK WITH ME HELP IDENTIFY ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. I MOVED TO AN APARTMENT ANY AXE TO A FIRST PLACE FOR YOU. AND I WAS WORKING REALLY HARD TO GET MY LIFE ON A GOOD TRACK BUT THAT WASN'T THE END OF MY TROUBLES. SOME OF THE GUYS I KNEW FROM OAKLAND HAVE FOUND ME IN MY JOB I FOUND OUT WHERE I LIVE IT WAS THE DANGERS INCIDENT AND COULD HAVE GONE REALLY BADLY. I WASN'T SAFE IN IT WASN'T SAFE FROM MY ROOMMATE BECAUSE THE GUYS TO SHOW UP AT MY PLACE AT ANY TIME MY WIFE A MY E. WANTED TO MOVE ME TO ANOTHER PLACE TO CONQUER FOR SAFETY. BUT IT COULD BE READY RIGHT AWAY THERE IS NO SHIRT SHORT TERM PLACE TO GO BEING THAT I WAS AT THE AGE OF UNDER.

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE BUMPS ALONG THE WAY DON'T BRING EVERYTHING AROUND IS CRASHING DOWN AS WELL. HIS BUDGET REQUEST WILL HELP BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE US MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO HELP SOLVE PROBLEMS AND GET ON A PATH TO PROGRESS. EVEN WHEN HARD TIMES COME UP I THINK FOR HIM TODAY ACTION WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. FOR SHARING THAT IS AS I SAID EARLIER IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE DO OUR EVALUATIONS.

WELL I MEAN COMPARING EARLIER REMARKS AND HE PUT A VERY HUMAN FACE ON EXACTLY THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND AT THE SAME TIME I WOULDN'T BE DOING MY JOB IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A REAL LINE PROGRAMS THAT HAD. RISKS AND ISSUES AND WE KNEW THAT AT THE TIME WE REALIZED IT -- AND MOVED THERE'S A TRADE OFF BETWEEN FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND HUMAN DECISIONS ON THAT SOMETHING WE WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE TOGETHER. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU [inaudible] COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BOTH FOR FOR JOINING US. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO ENTER AND REENTER EXTENDED FOSTER CARE ADVOCACY. YES. MR GIVES. YOU CAN PROGRAM. WHERE IT'S A SEVERE ON? AN ERRAND PHILOSOPHY OF SOMEBODY ANYWAY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO ENSURE THAT YOU. IN NEED OF TRANSITIONAL SERVICES ARE ABLE TO ENTER OR RE ENTER EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. EXTENDED FOSTER CARE BENEFITS ARE CRITICAL AS A YOUTH TRANSITION INTO ADULTHOOD. THESE YOU FACE GREAT CHALLENGES IN COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION. FINDING A STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. HOWEVER A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE COURTS THAT HAVE PREVENTED A VERY NARROW. GROUP OF FOSTER YOUTH FROM RECEIVING BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR CURRENTLY FOSTER YOU. SIX TO ACCESS EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SERVICES EIGHT OUT NO ONE UNDER SCORE AIDS OUT. IF THEY'RE TURNED EIGHTEEN BEFORE THEIR CASES ARE FULLY DECIDED. AND YOU THE ALSO PREVENTED FROM ACCESSING INSTEAD OF FOSTER CARE WITH THE GUARDIAN OR THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS CONTINUES. ARE TO RECEIVE BONDS EVEN THOUGH THAT THE FAMILIES NO LONGER -- FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE YOU THIS BUDGET REQUEST SIX TO CLOSE THE GAP FOR VULNERABLE TRANSITIONING H. FOSTER YOU IN THESE VERY NARROW NARROW NARROW SITUATIONS BY ENSURING THAT WE DO ALL THE WE CAN'T TO EQUIP. ARE YOU WITH THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED. OF THE ADVOCATES AND I HAVE -- CONTINUE TO MEET WITH A D. S. S. AND ALSO D. F. O. TO DETERMINE AT ESTIMATE. CASELOAD. WE RECEIVED A REPORT FROM LA -- X. -- ECSTATIC SEEING -- ESTIMATING COSTS HOWEVER WE HAVE YET TO REACH CONSENSUS -- ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM -- IT IS OUR HOPE AND OUR DESIRE THEY D. S. S. AND D. O. ELF CAN -- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES ON CASE LOAD ESTIMATES SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND CLOSE THE GAP. OF FOR THESE VERY VULNERABLE BUT NARROW YOUTH HERE IN OUR STATE. I'M HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES AS A YOUNG PERSON -- WE'RE HAPPY THAT WILL HAVE HERSELF INTRODUCED HERSELF. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MORE IT'S A STUDIO I AM A NON MINOR DEPENDENT FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD REMOVE A BARRIER TO EXTEND FOSTER CARE FOR YOUTH WHO. ENTER CARE OR RETURNED TO KERR AT AGE. SEVENTEEN I KNOW FROM PROPOSED. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW IMPORTANT THE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF EXTENT FOSTER CARE CAN BE AND HOW HARD IT IS. TO ACCESS AFTER A CERTAIN AGE I WAS RAISED BY MY GRANDPARENTS STARTING ONE WHEN I WAS AN INFANT MY FATHER'S DISABLED THERE WAS NEVER ABLE TO CARE FOR HIMSELF OR ME. MY MOTHER COULD NOT CARE FOR ME EITHER BECAUSE SHE STRUGGLED WITH SERIOUS DRUG ADDICTION. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN BOTH OF MY GRANDPARENTS DIED WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF EACH OTHER? IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I HAD NO PLACE TO GO. I STARTED COUCH SURFING A REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS I WAS SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED AFTER MY GRANDPARENTS DIED IT WASN'T SURE WHERE TO TURN. BY THE TIME IS CFS SOCIAL WORKER MET WITH ME AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN FOSTER CARE AND THE SERVICES AVAILABLE I WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF. THE SOCIAL WORKER TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE I WAS SO CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN THERE WASN'T ANYTHING CFS WOULD DO FOR ME. SHE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THINGS IN COR IN TIME TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY LONG TERM HELP IN IT. AND THAT IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE FOR TO ENTER FOSTER CARE FOR JUST A SHORT TIME. WITHOUT OTHER OPTIONS I KEPT COUCHSURFING AND WORKING WITH OTHER OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT YOU SENT SHELTERS AND TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. ONE OF THE SHELTER WORKERS REFERRED ME TO A LAWYER WHO WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ASSIST ME WITH ACCESSING FOSTER CARE SERVICES. MY LAWYER COULD NOT GET A CFS CASE THE RECORD AND TIME EITHER SHE WAS FOUND SHE FOUND IT ALL TO SEE CASE AND HAD A CONVERTED TO APPEND TITIAN NOT ALLOWED THE COURT TO PLACE ME IN FOSTER CARE. THE FACT IS I GOT LUCKY AT THE LAST MINUTE. WORKING WITH MY PROBATION OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WAS FIRST PLACE FOR YOU. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR PAEAN KEEP WORKING THROUGH THE LOSS OF MY GRANDPARENTS A FEELING AND FEELINGS ABOUT MY PARENTS. I AM CLOSE TO FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL AND I HAVE A JOB IN TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY. I AM WORKING WITH MY PROVIDERS TO COMPLETE COLLEGE APPLICATIONS AND BELIEVE COLLEGE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY. PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT EXTENDING FOSTER CARE FOR ME IS I WAS ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME. AND THIS HAS MADE ME ABLE TO CARE ABOUT MYSELF AGAIN WITHOUT THE SUPPORT I CURRENTLY HAVE I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE LIVING IN A CAR OR WORSE. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE SCHOOL AND I KNOW I WOULD HAVE LOST ALL MOTIVATION TO WORK. I AM SURE THAT COLLEGE WOULD NOT EVEN BE ON MY MIND. I AM ASKING THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THAT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME SO THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T LOSE IMPORTANT AND LYFT. LIFE CHANGING SUPPORT JUST BECAUSE THE COURT CASE TAKES TOO LONG TO COMPLETE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME THEIR INFLUX YES AND I'M HERE FROM BAY AREA LEGAL AID LARGELY TO SUPPORT THIS IDEA WHO'S BEEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME IN AND TESTIFY AND I'LL JUST NOTE THAT WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS A NARROW POPULATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M TO OF THE COMPONENTS WE THINK ARE PRIMARILY TECHNICAL FIXES FOR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THE PORTION THAT WOULD ALLOW YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COME IN AT AGE. SEVENTEEN AND DO NOT COMPLETE THEIR CASES IN TIME. TO REMAIN AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE COURT NOT COMPLETING THE JURISDICTIONAL OR DISPOSITIONAL HEARINGS IN TIME. SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL WE'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IT IS RELATIVELY SMALL BUT THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR ATTEMPTING TO REACH CONSENSUS ON THOSE NUMBER SO WE'RE HOPING THIS YEAR THAT. WE CAN FINALLY COME TO A A TRUE COST ESTIMATE AND GET SOME SOME HARD NUMBERS SINCE WE SHOULD BE ABLE [inaudible] TO EVALUATE THAT. THANK YOU BEFORE I ASK THE QUESTIONS I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU'RE FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL. NOW COLLEGES NEXT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT STATISTICS FOR FOSTER YOU. AND HOW FEW OF FOSTER YOU ACTUALLY GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BECAUSE OF THAT STATISTIC THERE ARE LOTS OF UNIVERSITIES THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU. THEY'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE THE UNIVERSITY THAT HAS THE BETTER STATISTICS. WHAT DO ONE STUDY? I WANT TO WORK WITH ANIMALS I'M NOT REALLY SURE PROBABLY IN -- MARINE BIOLOGIST OR SOMETHING. VERY GOOD I I'M SURE THAT THEY'LL FIND THE RIGHT UNIVERSITY FOR YOU COULD BE SAN DIEGO ONE OF THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES ALONG THE COAST BUT LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO YOU. AND AS SOON AS YOU GET TO A COUNSELOR TO BE SURE YOU TELL THEM YOU WANT TO KNOW. EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU. THERE'S A LOT THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEY'VE LOTS OF PROGRAMS WITH THE STARTED A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIKE THIS SPEAKER JUST BEFORE YOU OR YOU GO STRAIGHT TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE. LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES. INSIST THAT THEY TELL YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S AVAILABLE. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUE ABOUT TO THE THIS CASE THE CASE LOAD NUMBER. WHAT'S THE EARLIEST THOSE NUMBERS CAN BE PROVIDED. FEATURING A WHAT THE DEPARTMENT -- I I THINK AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN I I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO YEARS NOT THREE UNDER DISCUSSION -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND FORTH THERE I'M NOT PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE STATUS OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE. THE STAFF IS YEAH GREG ROSE THE DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON STAFF AND OTHER ADVOCATES -- WE GET THAT THE NUMBERS THAT THE NUMBERS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE RELATIVELY SOON IT WE BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME ACTUAL LANGUAGE TOOK TOOK TAKE A LOOK AT SO THAT WE CAN -- SEE IN FACT IF THE IF THE THAT THAT THAT THE NARROWNESS THAT THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS ARTICULATED THERE AS WELL -- ARE ARE ARE. CLEARLY WE AREN'T INTERESTED WE ARE WE ARE INTERESTED IN NOT HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE OF SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW DELAY IN COURT OR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND BECAUSE WE DON'T A WE HAVE A HARD TIME ACTUALLY VERIFYING THEM -- ARE IN FACT VERY SMALL SO -- I WE WE WERE WAITING ON SOME LANGUAGE AND WE ARE GOING TO FINISH CRUNCH IN SOME NUMBERS AND AND AND PRIVATE PROVIDING THAT BACK TO THE TO THE THE ADVOCATES. TO THE THE EARLIEST WE CAN GET THE UPDATED CASELOAD NUMBERS. RETHINKING A MONTH. LESS -- LESS LESS THAN LESS THAN A MONTH I MEAN WE'RE BASED ON THAT THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ONCE WE HAVE THE THE THE THE THAT THAT LANGUAGE BE ABLE TO TO VERIFY IT TO TO COME UP WITH SOME. NUMBER -- AND THEN IT HAS TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PROCESS. TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT. IT REALLY APPEARS LIKE A BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE YES -- I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE DAHLE SUPPORTING THIS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT ONCE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS AND PERHAPS WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE. IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER. IS LARGER THAN THE CASE THAT THE CASELOAD THAT THE LA -- HAS ESTIMATED. I THINK THAT WE I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE LA -- TESTAMENT [inaudible] THE END. FINALLY I THINK THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS CONSIDERING. THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL GROUP WAS THE SMALL NUMBER -- IN DESPERATE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK THAT THAT IS CLEAR AND ALSO FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIBSON'S -- TESTIMONY OF THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THAT IS CLEAR -- ARE THERE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT. DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A RESULT OF AS A RESULT OF THIS. AGAIN I THINK IT WILL BE ONLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- THAT I COULD IMAGINE IS -- IS IF THERE ARE SOME IF THE THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G THE&lt;/c&gt; LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- THAT IS BEING CLARIFIED SOMEHOW HAS A HAS HAS AN OPENING IN IT THAT WHERE THAT IS IS IN IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED MADE BUT I'M WAITING TO ACTUALLY SEE THE THE SPECIFIC THE THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OTHERWISE. ANY ENDED THE ONLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOES DOES THAT IS THERE ANY KIND OF PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING AND HAVE THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AND UP -- IT IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE THERE'S BEEN -- THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT -- NOT IN THIS SPECIFIC INCH IS INSTANCE BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO GUARD WE WOULD WANT TO GUARD AGAINST. I HAVE NO INDICATION AT THIS POINT THAT THERE WILL BE. ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT AGAIN AND TELL WE ARE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE I THINK WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BE AS DEFINITIVE THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO BE AT THE MOMENT. AND SO THAT SO THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE LANGUAGE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LANGUAGE FOR THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A UP. A BILL AND THAT BUDGET ASKED TOGETHER AND WE HAVE SEEN -- WE WE HAVE WE HAVE AYE AYE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS UPDATED LANGUAGE TO BE IT'S COMING THE GIPSON. CAN WE GET THAT LANGUAGE TO THEM IMMEDIATELY YES I'M. LOOKING FOR MONTHS WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY WE'VE WORKED ON THAT LANGUAGE AND WE MET WITH A VARIETY OF ADVOCATES VERY RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH THEM FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND WE DID. AND I ACTUALLY THANK. MR ROSE HE HAD HE IS VERY HELPFUL IN AND GETTING BACK TO US WITH CONCERNS AND WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS I THINK WHAT. WE WERE LOOKING AT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SOME HOPEFUL THAT THAT'S DONE THAT LANGUAGE IS READY AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TODAY. BUT OKAY IT WILL THERE IT IS. TO THE LANGUAGE WILL BE READY TODAY AND THEN WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO WE'LL GET THE THE THE UPDATED NUMBERS. MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALL RIGHT. MADAM CHAIR. YES MY ROOM BY MAY I I THINK. THIS IS A GREAT OPTION AND OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS GIVEN -- IN AND PRIOR IT REALLY GOES TO A PASSION -- THAT WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ALSO WITH THE HOMELESS YOUTH IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING MORE PROACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE FOR THEM. SO IN LOOKING AT THAT AND GETTING THAT FINAL LANGUAGE -- TO YOU WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT -- KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A PROACTIVE MEASURE -- TO KEEP A BALANCE ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE BEING USED IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF WERE ABLE TO BE PROACTIVE GET THOSE RESOURCES NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT GREATER IMPACT ON THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION THAT WERE SEEN. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GEN SEEN THOSE THINGS MOVE FORWARD. WE WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MOVING FORWARD BUT WHEN YOU SAID LOOK AT IT PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ASPECT OF IT IN THE SAVINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD. BECAUSE THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING NOW THANK YOU. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED THESE ARE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF YEAR OLDS. INCOMPLETE PERIL. THE THE THE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING I MR GIPSON YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR FOSTER YOUTH. I THANK YOU FOR THAT TO YOU YOU HAVE BEEN. YOUR HEART HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND YOU PUSH THE REST OF US AND YOU MAKE US ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WERE ALWAYS ON BOARD WITH YOU I THANK YOU FOR FOR ALL THAT ADVOCACY. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- LA -- OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. LET'S GO TO ISSUE. FIVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON YOU'RE STAYING RIGHT WITH US SOUNDS THEIR ANNA JOHNSON. AND JUSTIN VERY THIS IF WE CAN BRING YOU BACK. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HERE -- BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT AND DELINQUENCY PETITION FOR FOSTER CHILDREN IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. THIS IS -- THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE WANT PROVIDE TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION. WITH BARBEL YOU. AND EXPAND IT DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPMENT TO A PRIEST -- APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO YOUTH AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE. THE GOAL. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FIND A COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO DIVERT FOSTER YOU AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IN WAYS THAT IS BOTH SOCIALLY AND FISCALLY. RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY DO WE SAVE MONEY BY PREVENTING -- THESE YOUTH FROM CROSSING OVER INTO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- WE REVITALIZED COMMUNITIES BY HELPING THEM BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS. WHO ARE YOU -- EMOTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY STABLE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING A TESTIMONY FOR THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS MADE ON A JOHNSON UP FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER OF YOUTH AND LAW. WHO? THAT ORGANIZATIONS ALSO A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WONDERFUL JOHNSON THANK YOU GOOD EVENING AT CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ANNA JOHNSON SENIOR POLICY ASSOCIATE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW AND I AM HERE TO SPEAK -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS ONE TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION OF NINE MILLION TO AUGMENT THE FOSTERING SUCCESS FUND. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FACILITIES LOCATED IN NINETEEN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES MADE EXCESSIVE CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ON YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. THESE FACILITIES AVERAGE CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY SOME AVERAGE FOUR TIMES A DAY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME SEVEN TIMES A CALLING THEIR CARE -- YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE IN THESE FACILITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY CRIMINALIZE FOR NORMAL CHILDHOOD BEHAVIOURS BEHAVIORS THAT ARE RELATED TO TRAUMA OR BEHAVIORS THAT ARE GENDER NON CONFORMING. DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LGBT Q. YOUTH AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES DISPROPORTIONATE NIGHTLY IMPACTING USE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY NATIVE YOUTH. MOST PARENTS WOULD NOT CALL THE COPS ON THEIR OWN CHILDREN ABOUT A THROWN GLASS OF WATER A POKE OF A SIBLING WITH A CANDY CANE ON A HOLIDAY OR RUNNING IN THE HOUSE. BUT FOR USE IN THESE FACILITIES SPECIFICALLY THE THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THIS IS NOT JUST A SIMPLE ENCOUNTER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS MANY OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HEARD IN THE SPECIAL YOU'RE HEARING YESTERDAY ON AB THREE NINETY TWO THIS IS A COMPLEX. RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH AND IT'S A FEARFUL RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT THAT THERE MAY BE -- THIS IS ACTUALLY THE BEGINNING OF FOSTER CARE TO PRISON PIPELINE. AS AS THE MEMBER MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON MENTIONED WHAT THIS FUND WILL DO YOU -- SO I WILL SKIP OVER THOSE POINTS THERE BUT CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY ALREADY BEGUN TO MOVE TOWARDS THIS HEALTH BASED APPROACH TO DEALING WITH YOUTH AND CONFLICT OF THE WITH THE LAW. INCLUDING INVESTING IN DIVERSION PROGRAMS AND TRAUMA INFORMED COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR YOUTH. IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA MADE AT THE FIRST FOUR MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION TO ESTABLISH THE FUND INSISTS BEGIN TO DEFER EAT DIVERT YOUTH IN STATE CARE AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE INITIAL FUNDS IS WELL ON ITS WAY WITH CDS WITH THE APARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES RELEASING THE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. AND TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS CONDUCTED THROUGH A WEAPON ARE WHERE THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT TURNED OUT FOR THAT WEAPON ARE AND ARE INTERESTED IN DELIVERING THE SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THAT INITIAL ALLOCATION WILL ONLY COVER ABOUT THREE TO FOUR COUNTIES OF THOSE NINETEEN WAS STATED NEED -- IF THE COUNTIES REPRESENTED ON THIS COMMITTEE ALONE WOULD EXCEED THE AMOUNT COVERED BY LAST YEAR'S ONE TIME AUGMENTATION ARE ALLOCATION. AND ARE FURTHER MORE THEY'RE COMPARING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A 10% INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASING TREND SO WE KNOW THAT THIS ONE TIME ALLOCATION IS -- WOULD BE VERY WELCOME IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT CHILDREN IN THE SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ABUSE NEGLECT AND TRAUMA. AND THOSE IN GROUP CARE ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO CROSSING OVER AND RELYING ON POLICE TO DEAL WITH YOUTHFUL BEHAVIOR PUSHES CHILDREN INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEED. TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITY -- YOU DEVELOPMENT A DIVERSION PROGRAM IMPROVES YES BEHAVIOR AND OUTCOMES IMPROVES PUBLIC SAFETY AND IS A SMARTER INVESTMENT -- AND THIS I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF BE QUICK HERE WITH A SKIP OVER SOME STUFF SINCE I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW THAT SO -- BY REDUCING OUR OVERLOOKED AND RELIANCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY BASED TIME IN FORCE FROM INFORMED CARE CALIFORNIA WILL IMPROVE LIFE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. BETTER UTILIZE SCARCE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES AND IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. ANY FEEDBACK FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. A PICTURE RECORD FROM THE DEPARTMENT I REALLY DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD WE WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW I COULD HAVE ON THE LAST ITEM THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY AS WELL IN NON DISCUSSION PORTION OF THE AGENDA -- THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS FROM OUR OFFICE OF THE FOSTER CARE OMBUDSMAN AND A LOT OF WORK AND ON ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE ISSUE FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A GOOD THING WE WENT ALL SUPPORT THAT -- I I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE MONEY THAT WAS IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET IS HAVING AN IMPACT OR THE IMPACT THAT WAS INTENDED OF IT. THE COMMENT THAT I'VE MADE PREVIOUSLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE MAKE AN INVESTMENT WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR IT WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE FOR IT. PER SHARE THE CLARIFICATION THIS IS A ONE TIME REQUEST. THAT COMES ALONG WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT STARTING SOMETHING AND THEN STOPPING SOMETHING OR WHAT COMES NEXT AS THE NEXT STOP FOR THESE PROVIDERS AS THEY EXPAND THE CAPACITY. UP SO AGAIN COMING BACK TO THE HOW DO WE PROVE THAT IT WORKS SO THAT WE KNOW WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE OR NOT. SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME KINDS OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD ADDITIONALLY NOTE -- AND COULD PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT EARLIER THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN THE ADDRESSING OF THE ISSUES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. YOU HEARD THP PLUS TALK ABOUT BAD CAPACITY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE. THEN WE HEARD A PROPOSAL ABOUT -- AT ADVOCATING FOR NAVIGATORS TO HELP PEOPLE FIND PLACES TO STAY HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING THEM ACHIEVE PERMANENCY WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY IN A CONGREGATE CARE SITUATION. AND DIVERTING THEM FROM CRIMINAL JUSTICE SO THERE'S A CERTAIN PIECE TO THAT WE WOULD LIKE A PART IN THE CONVERSATION NOT JUST WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN ARE WE GETTING AT BUT ALSO HOW DO THESE THINGS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER SO IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED CONVERSATION. VALID ISSUE AND AGAIN FIRST THING I SAID REDUCING THE CRIMINALIZATION OF YOUTH AND THEIR BEHAVIORS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT HUMAN THING TO BE DOING. BERMAN FINANCE -- ARE JUST INTEREST FROM FINANCE ANSWERED LIKE THAT ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN SOME APPROACHES ON THIS I BELIEVE -- REGULATIONS WERE JUST FINALIZED IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AND IT WITH -- A LOT OF THESE FACILITIES ON ADDRESS SCENE -- PICTURED COULD END IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT THE NEED FOR CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT ON THERE. THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'RE CORRECTIVE PARENTS AREN'T GOING TO CALL. POLICE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COME AND HELP THEM. OUT. SOLVE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THIS THE USER TEENS AND THEY'RE ACTING OUT AND BUT ONCE THEY'RE CRIMINALIZE ONCE THEY ARE PUT INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN IT'S SO HARD TO GET THEM OUT BECAUSE THAT REMAINS WITH THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS TO US. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SIX THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT YET [inaudible] DAVID DEMOING [inaudible] SHE ISSUE NUMBER SIX ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF MANDATED STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. FOR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. ADVOCACY PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO TO BE HERE. MY NAME AGAIN IS DAVID DOWN WHEN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY THAT PROVIDES A ADOPTIONS AND FOSTER CARE SERVICES. AT LEAST FOR OUR AGENCY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WE SERVE ABOUT A THOUSAND FOSTER CHILDREN. ARE PRIMARILY CHILDREN OF COLOR AND MINORITIES. I I WANT TO FIRST SAY THAT WE APPLIED. THE COMMITMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO INCREASE THE WAGES AWFUL WORKERS BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE. FOR ALL THE WORKERS SEEN IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO OUR BUDGET REQUEST THAT DEALS WITH THE IMPACT. THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES ON THE ABILITY OF THE NONPROFIT SUCH AS THE ONE THAT I WORKED WITH. TO PAY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. THE STATE SAID IF A FAIR RATES FOR SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN FROZEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND WERE CUT 10% IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE WE SAW A SLIGHT INCREASE OUR THREE YEARS AGO. BUT NOTHING CLOSE ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST OF INCREASING SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES. I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL AGREE THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE GREAT ADVOCATES AND MENTORS WERE OUR FOSTER CHILDREN. IN THE SYSTEM. MAKING MATTERS WORSE FOR IF A FACE. THE STATE LAW REQUIRES THE EXAM PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES BE PAID DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE. WHILE THE MINIMUM WAGE ACT MANDATES ANNUAL INCREASES TO THE STATE'S MINIMUM WEIGHT. FFA RAID DID NOT COVER THE COST OF PAYING OUR SOCIAL WORKERS DOUBLE THAT MINIMUM WAGE. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO WE DO WITH AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING SOURCES. AND WE DON'T SEE ANY RATE INCREASES. IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I THERE'S ONLY TWO STATE SET FOSTER RATES AT THE NOT REESE WHO RECEIVE A MANUAL ADJUSTMENT. ONE IS THE FAA RATE AND SADLY THE OTHER ONE NEEDS FOR INFANT CARE SUPPLEMENT. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WITH THE LAW. WE'RE ASKING THAT THE BUDGET ALLOCATION OF TWENTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THOUSAND TWENTY ANY FURTHER INCREASE OF FFA RATES AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SUBSEQUENT CALENDAR YEAR. AT THE LESSER OF THREE POINT FIVE OF THE CHANGE IN THE US CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. AS YOU KNOW IF IT FOR YOU PROVIDE CARE SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. SOME 25% OF THOSE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN FOSTER CARE. IF A FACE ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESS WILL IMPLEMENT THE STATE'S CONTIENEN WITH CARE REFORM. THAT SIGNATURE HOME BASE FAMILY CARE FOR EVERY CHILD IN FOSTER CARE. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR BRING IN FFA SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES INTO COMPLIANCE. WITH THE NEW STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAW. THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH THIS SOUNDS LIKE A TOTALLY LOGICAL -- REQUEST. ALMOST SEEMS LIKE -- IT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR WHATEVER REASON. IS A FOR INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING -- THAT GOES WITH THAT. OF IT ANY THAT IS THE DSS SERGIO OUT HAVE [inaudible] COMMENTS. YEAH I THINK YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT ARE ANXIOUS AS HEARING THE GOOD OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WERE CARRYING FOUR DEPENDS IN PART ON A STABLE AND THUS PROPERLY COMPENSATED WORK FORCE -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE RATES SAYS AS MENTIONED THAT DOESN'T AUTO ADJUST FOR CHANGES IN MINIMUM WAGE THE DEFINITION OF IT IS AS HE DESCRIBED IF IF YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL BY WAGE ORDER NUMBER FOR YOUR YOUR WAIT A YEAR WAGE MUST BE DOUBLE THE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND AND WHILE WE ARE WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY WERE ALSO ON A PASSED TO TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR -- AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME -- SOME FFA IS ARE ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD TODAY UNDER THEIR RATE -- OTHERS ARE NOT WE UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF WAGES IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR THESE FOLKS THESE ARE PEOPLE WITH MASTERS DEGREES AND SOCIAL WORK -- AND SO YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD THAT SHOULD WEIGH IN THEIR AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND IF WE CONTINUE TO CLASSIFY THEM AS A PROFESSIONAL WHICH WHICH IS THE MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THEY ARE -- THEN THE WAGE ORDER IS IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THERE WHICH NEEDS TO BE DOUBLE MINIMUM WAGE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU [inaudible] BERMAN FINANCE [inaudible] HELLO. I I DO WANT TO JUST COMMENT THAT -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL WORKERS THERE ARE. OBVIOUSLY MANY HERE YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND THEIR WORK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THIS FIELD AND SO MANY OTHER FEELS AND I I THANK YOU -- BY MY SISTER REMINDS ME THAT IT'S SHE HAS A DOCTOR AND SOCIAL WORK THIS REMINDS ME THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE REALLY THE ONES WHO DO THE WORK YEAH. THAT THE REST OF US JUST TALK ABOUT IT BUT THE SOCIAL WORKERS TO IT. SO IN HONOR OF MY SISTER ROSA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT CONCLUDES SOME ISSUE NUMBER SIX WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN CHILD WELFARE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING. EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM MARQUITA [inaudible] HERIS [inaudible] YES. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARQUITA HARRIS FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS I HAVE WORKED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE SERVING CHILDREN EVERY IS. PLACED INTO FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHT POINT TWO FIVE MILLION FOR THE STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL BE MATCHED BY EQUAL OR MORE FEDERAL. TITLED NINETEEN FUNDING THOUSAND IS COUNTY IS THE HOME OF THE LARGEST CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AS TO AS CHALLENGE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WE SERVE MILLIONS. AT RISK DETAINED THE TENSION FAMILIES WHO TYPICALLY SHOULDER A HIGHER BURDEN OF CHRONIC AND PREVENTABLE DISEASES AND COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE IN EPIDEMICS OF DIABETES AS MOBY CITY. ARTISANS EXTRACTING AN INFANTS WHO ARE EXPOSED. TO ABUSE WHILE MOTHERS ARE PREGNANT. EACH MONTH OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS IN LA COUNTY REPORT IS A BIT SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES DO. DO NOT GO OUT ON EVERY REFERRAL. WE GO OUT ON CALLS THAT COME FROM MULTIPLE PROVIDERS FROM HOSPITALS CLINICS SCHOOLS OR WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKER. HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT BY PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES NECESSARY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A FEW STORIES WITH YOU TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE PLATE IN THE TOWER FOR ASSISTANCE. I HAD A SIX YEAR OLD CHILD WHO WAS NOT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE REFERRAL THE MOTHER HAD SEVEN TWO CHILDREN THE CHILD WITH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE POUNDS. THE CHAO HAD A TRAIT DUE TO MORBID OBESITY N. SLEEP APNEA WHEN I WENT TO THE HOME AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS HE TANKS WHICH OXYGEN TANK THAT WAS LEFT NEXT TO THE HEATER. ALSO THAT THE CHILD HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWED UP ON THE WITH THE PULLMAN KNOWLEDGES THAT MANAGES THE TRADE FOR OVER A YEAR THE MOTHER THROUGH ALL THE SUPPLIES IN THE CLOSET. AND WILL BASICALLY NOT TAKING CARE OF THE CHILD. SO DO TO MY A A I'M GOING DILIGENCE THE CHILD WAS SAID CONNECTED TO THE POLL MONOLOGIST I SUBMITTED MY MEDICAL CONCERNS THE CHILD WAS A MINUTE A NEATLY INTO. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT THE CHILD WAS ALSO MONITOR BY DOCTOR EVERY TEN MINUTES DUE TO THE CRITICAL ILLNESS OF THE CHILD THE CHILD HAD MULTIPLE BACTERIAL. DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFECTION AROUND THE TRACK AND IN THE TRICK AND THE DOCTORS THAT THE POINT TOLD ME THAT I SAY THAT CHILD'S LIFE. ANOTHER STORY I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT I HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD ON CONTROL DIABETIC. TYPE ONE WHICH MEANS THAT THEIR INSULIN DEPENDENT. OF THE SOCIAL WORKER NOTIFIED ME THAT THE SCHOOL SAID THAT THE CHILD'S BLOOD SUGAR WAS FIVE HUNDRED I ASKED THE SOCIAL WORK AND TAKE THE CHILD TO EMERGENCY ROOM TO HAVE THAT MEDICAL ASSESSMENT. DUE TO I HEARD ABOUT THE PAIR'S NOT COMPLIANCE AND UNSUPERVISED IN SUBDIVISION OF THE CHILD. ALSO I DID COMPLETED THE JOY HOME VISIT THAT SAME WEEK I WAS ABLE TO ASSESS THE FAMILIES NEED SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME EMOTION THE SO THEY NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO MENTAL HEALTH. MOM WAS CRYING AND STRUGGLING WITH THE TEEN TEEN ALSO STRUGGLING. SO I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT THEM ALSO I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE THE METER FOR THE BLOOD SUGARS AND NOTICED THAT THE CHILD HAD. SEVERE HIGHS CONTINUOUSLY FROM MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED CELLS ABLE TO SHOW THAT THAT FAMILY THAT IF THEY GO ON CHECK AT THE INSULIN IF THE BLOOD SUGAR IS UNCHECKED AND NOT COVER. THE NO CHILD THE BLOOD SUGAR WILL KEEP GOING UP IN THE CHAO COULD POSSIBLY DIE. SO WHAT DO TO MY DILIGENCE I RECOMMENDED THAT THE FAMILY ALSO GO BACK INTO THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST TO BE RETESTED ON HOW TO MANAGE THE DIABETES REGIMENT WHICH IS STILL SO IMPORTANT. ALSO OF THAT IMPACT IF WE WERE IF I WAS ABLE TO GO IN SOONER. LIKE THE ONE WITH THE TRICK THEY'RE NOT PREVENTED THE CHILD FROM BEING DETAINED AND KEPT THE CHILD IN THE HOME WITH THE DIABETIC PATIENTS. I WAS ABLE TO SO FAR KEEP THE CHILD IN THE HOME DUE TO THE SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND THEN ALSO TO DO A FOLLOW UP VISIT. TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD SUGGESTED IN RECOMMENDED THAT IS IN PLACE AND THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING IN FOLLOWING THE DIABETIC A PROPER REGIMENT PRO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS SO THEN I WILL MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT THAT TIME. TO PREVENT THE CHILD FROM BEING REMOVED FROM THE HOME WE LIKE TO KEEP THE FAMILIES TOGETHER. SO PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES LINK FAMILIES TO PREVENTATIVE IN INTERVENTIONAL HEALTH SERVICES. TO AT RISK CHILDREN BEFORE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS BECOME LIFE THREATENING PROTECTING CHILDREN. THE TECHNICIAN WITHIN AGAINST UNNECESSARY HELP THE CLIENT AND THE WARNING CHILD FATALITY. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE FIRST EXAMPLE THAT I THAT I HAD MENTIONED I SAY THAT CHILD'S LIFE. SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ARE WE WE HAVE THAT UNIQUE SKILL TO WHERE WE CAN ASSESS THE CHAO FROM HEAD TO TOE AND DETERMINE WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE TYPE OF SERVICES FOR THAT CHILD. SOME OPEN IT TO SUPPORT OUR OF EARLY INTERVENTION PILOT PROGRAM OF EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION. WITH A FEDERAL MATCH OF THE EIGHT POINT. TWO FIVE I JUST HAD TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS. ONE IS THAT IT'S LA COUNTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST AND I ARE IN SAN BERNADINO. SECONDS THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE YOU I'VE GOT. TO I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT -- I JUST IN THE WAY THAT YOU PRESENT THIS -- IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU ARE DEDICATED TO THIS ABSOLUTE AND WHEN WE HAVE DEDICATED -- TO PEOPLE SUCH AS YOURSELF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE TO LISTEN -- YOU YOU ARE DOING THE WORK. JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE TALKING TO THE FOSTER YOUTH THAT'S IMPORTANT OVER TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. I THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND ALSO BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS Y. LA COUNTY WHY SO MUCH FOR JUST ONE COUNTY. WERE UNDERSTAND LA COUNTY AS ONE THIRD. OF ALL THE CASELOAD FOR THE STATE OF CALLAHAN'S A LITTLE BIT THERE'S SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA ALONE AND LA COUNTY HAS. TWENTY THOUSAND SO WE'RE HUGE COUNTY YES YOU ARE -- IF WE COULD GET THE PILOT GOING IN AND THEN EVENTUALLY IF I COULD TO ONLY DISCREDIT STATEWIDE ABSOLUTE ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT SEVEN GET OR OR LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF PILOT PROGRAM -- IN BOTH AREAS I THINK ON A ON A DIFFERENT SCALES. SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY ONES LEFT. RIGHT NOW YEAH YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW COUNTY REMAINS THE LARGEST COUNTY WITH WITH THE GREAT GREAT NEED THIS OVERLOOKED ALSO COUNTY AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE COMPLEXES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SOCIAL ECONOMICS AND ALSO THEY'RE NOT. ALWAYS EDUCATED A LOT ON THE BELOW SIX GRADE LEVEL SO THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO AN AUDIT TAKE CARE OF OUR ANOTHER REASON WHY SHOULD BE A PILOT PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES. IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE MEMBERS AND CLIENTS TO DO -- TRAVEL ON BECAUSE IT'S SO CLOSE FROM LA COUNTY IN DECEMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY SO IT COULD BE SERVING THE SAME FOLDED STARED JUST A A FOOD FOR THOUGHT. AND IF WE KEEP TALKING WILL DAVID GIVE YOU EVER REASON POSSIBLE. THE HOUSING IS LESS EXPENSIVE SO WE KNOW THAT. THAT LA COUNTY HI THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT BUT THE POPULATION DOES CONTINUE. TO MOVE DOESN'T SEE COUNTY LINES IT SEES THE NEED GOING. AND EVERYWHERE THIS NEED IT SO WE WOULD -- AVIC OUR IN OUR ADVOCATING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM ALSO ASSEMBLY NO COUNTY. WE GOT TO GET WATER LA FOR FOR YOU GUYS BUT BECAUSE THEY ONLY COUNTIES HAS THE ONE THIRD OF THE FOSTER USE. IF WE CAN GET THAT PILOT GOING TO NAIL BEEN CORRECTED AND THEN WE CAN DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE OF THE COUNTIES I THINK. YOU'LL PROBABLY BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ONE LITTLE BUGS AND DIFFERENT THINGS OTHER PROBLEMS BUT ENOUGH. IT IS DEFINITELY THERE IS A NEED FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MS HARRIS -- IT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION ONE MORE PLUG FOR SAN BENITO COUNTY YES THERE. IS THERE A I WOULD GREG ROSE TO THE DEPARTMENT I JUST AS A SOCIAL WORKER MYSELF CLEARLY THE THAT THE SKILL SET FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE -- IS IS -- IS DIFFERENT AND OFTEN COMPLEMENTARY AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST SUGGEST THAT IF THE IF THIS IS A PRIORITY THAT WE COULD WE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK WITH ON IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT CONTINUATION OF BRINGING FAMILIES HOME -- FRANK MECCA FEEL. TO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FRANK MECCA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CWD A I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND HOUSING CALIFORNIA. AMR SEEKING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR COALITION ADVOCATED FOR THE CREATION OF BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. BASED ON WHAT WE SAW WITH THE GROWING CONCERN IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LINK BETWEEN CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG FAMILIES. AT THE TIME NATIONAL DATA INDICATED ABOUT ONE THIRD OF CHILD OFFER INVOLVE FAMILIES WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND MORE HOMELESSNESS BUT CAN NOT IN AND OF ITSELF BE A BASIS FOR REMOVAL THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A LINK BETWEEN REFERRALS TO CPS. AND HOMELESSNESS. AND EVEN MORE COMMON FAMILIES HAVE COMPLIED WITH COURT ORDERS AND RULES OR OTHERWISE READY TO REUNIFY WE KNOW ARE NOT BEING REUNIFIED BECAUSE JUDGES ARE LOATH. TO REUNIFY CHILDREN TO THE STREETS. I'M IN SO WE LITERALLY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE FOR NO OTHER REASON. BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR PARENTS CAN'T FIND SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. AND SO THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM WAS CREATED AS A DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM THE TRAILER BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT USES THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. THAT WE'VE SEEN SUCCESSFULLY WORK IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. COUNTY AGENCIES COLLABORATE TO OFFER HOUSING SUPPORTS. RENT RENTAL ASSISTANCE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S HOUSING MODIFICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE -- TO ALLOW FOR SUCCESSFUL REUNIFICATION OF CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES ACCORDING TO THE S. S. IS DATA. BETWEEN THE START UP IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN JUST OVER ONE YEAR OF OPERATION THE PROGRAM IS PERMANENTLY HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR FAMILIES. WHICH IS ALREADY EXCEEDING BUT FIVE HUNDRED FAMILY GOAL THAT WE ORIGINALLY SET FOR THE PROGRAM. AND DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEMONSTRATION WE'VE ALSO GAIN BETTER DATA ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT. ARE COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE REPORTING NOW THAT HALF OF CHILD WHILE BROOMBALL FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- SO FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING DEMONSTRATION IS SET TO EXPIRE ON JUNE THIRTIETH AND SOAP WILL WE WILL BE TAKING NO MORE REFERRALS -- IN THE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONLY IN JUST THE TWELVE COUNTIES THAT ARE DEMONSTRATING BRINGING FAMILIES HOME THEIR FIVE HUNDRED IS TIONAL FAMILIES THAT ARE DETERMINED ELIGIBLE BUT ARE WAITING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION DSS WAS TASKED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF COLLECTING DATA AND REPORTING ON THE OUTCOMES AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT WORK IS IN PROCESS. BUT CLEARLY THE EARLY RESULTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THAT THE REPORTS WERE MY MEMBERS INDICATE THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE AND BENEFICIAL PROGRAM AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING. THAT THE PROGRAM BE RE AUTHORIZED FOR TWO MORE YEARS AND BE INCREASED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. SO THAT WE CAN BOTH EXPAND. THE DEMONSTRATION WITHIN THE EXISTING COUNTIES BUT ALSO EXPAND TO NEW COUNTIES WHICH I SHOULD SAY IS SORT OF THE ARK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. TRUCK WHEN IT CREATED AND THEN EXPANDED THE COW WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH THIS IS IN SOME WAY MODELED AFTER. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. PERHAPS IT'S A SIGN OF OUR CLOSE COLLABORATION ON THIS OF MISTER MECCA STOLE ALL MY STATISTICS. WELL TO BE FAIR -- WE STOLE THEM FROM PETE'S STAFF THE YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID THE OF A HE NOTED THE EVALUATION WON'T BE DONE UNTIL NEXT YEAR. I WOULD ADD IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN REUNIFIED THAT'S TWELVE HUNDRED KIDS. JUST TO ADD THAT NUMBER IN THERE. AND FROM A PROGRAM OPERATIONS STANDPOINT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THIS WAS A ONE TIME THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WITH AN EVALUATION COMPONENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT PROGRAMMATIC LEE TO TO RUN SOMETHING STOP IT AND RESTART IT IF THAT DECISION IS MADE TO RESTART. ADDITIONALLY I'D NOTE THAT WHEN YOU REUNIFY FAMILY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS HEARING ON ISSUE ONE ON C. C. R. WHEN YOU RE UNIFY THESE ARE KIDS THAT DON'T NEED A RESOURCE FAMILY BECAUSE THEIR WITH THEIR FAMILIES. SO AGAIN ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER. SO -- SHIP [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS THERE FOLLOW UP THAT'S DONE WITH THE FAMILIES TO SEE IF THE PLACEMENT HAS BEEN PERMANENT AND SO THESE THESE ARE FAMILY THERE ACTUALLY ARE UNDER COURT SUPERVISION -- EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR OR THROUGH A PETITION BEING FILED SO. ON THE DECISION TO REUNIFY HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE JUDGE. AND SO THE JUDGE WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A FAMILY THAT'S REMOVED ALL OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS. DAVE COMPLIED WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE REQUIRED AND AND I THE JUDGE I'M READY. TO TO ORDER REUNIFICATION BUT FOR THE FACT. THAT THE PARENTS DON'T HAVE A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND SO -- THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR REUNIFICATION I E. THAT THE CHILD WILL BE SAFE WITH THAT FAMILY. IN THIS CASE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MATT AND ARE CERTIFIED TO BY THE JUDGE BEFORE THEY WOULD ISSUE THE REUNIFICATION ORDER. WHAT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF? FUNDING IS A PROVIDED. KIDS WILL STAY IN FOSTER CARE LONGER. AND PARENTS WHO SHOULD BE WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN WHO SHOULD BE WITH THEIR PARENTS WERE BOTH SUFFER THE TRAUMA OF BEING SEPARATED. BRITAIN BUT FOR THE ONLY REASON BEING THE FACT THAT HOUSING IS SOEXPENSIVE AND SO DIFFICULT TO FIND. AND THEY NEED HELP WITH IT AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM WAS NEVER BUILT. TO PROVIDE HOUSING SUPPORTS AS PART OF THE REUNIFICATION MILIEU THANK YOU. YOUR AVAILABLE SPACE WHICH OF PLEASE DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE OUR LAST ISSUE. WE HAVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ANY TABLE ALREADY -- C. W. S. TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT YES WHAT WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. AND WE'RE SEEKING TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR DSS NOT FOR COUNTIES. AND IT'S FOR DSS. TO AUGMENT THE EXISTING CHILD WELFARE TRAINING THAT THEY PROVIDE TO OUR WORKERS. THIS -- INVESTMENT WOULD LEVERAGE TWELVE ADDITIONAL MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO READ THE RESULT IN TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND SH THAT SHIFTED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAVEL FOR THE COUNTIES. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FUNCTIONS THAT WERE NOT REALIGNED AND TRAINING WITH ONE OF THEM. THE BELIEF AT THE TIME AND I THINK IT'S THOUGH IF IT'S THE RIGHT BELIEF WAS THAT FOR PURPOSES OF ENSURING CONSISTENCY.
