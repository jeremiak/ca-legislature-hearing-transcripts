01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:45.779
SHORT TERM CHARACTER.

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:48.582
MUSIC AND LEAVE.

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:50.484
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES --

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:52.319
WITH THEM.

01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:53.754
THEY CREATE CONFUSION AS TO WHAT

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.589
EXACTLY IS COVERED.

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:56.923
THEY OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE DO NOT

01:44:59.026 --> 01:45:00.227
THEY'RE VERY PRACTICAL THINGS

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.407
A AND THIS GETS COMPOUNDED SOME

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.374
IS BECAUSE THE WAY IN WHICH YEAR

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:16.977

THEY DO NOT COVER PRE EXISTING

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:25.719
CONDITIONS.

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.721
IT THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO

FINANCIAL LOSSES.

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:36.029
WHEN A CONDITION ARISES THAT

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER --

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:23.610
COLLEAGUES I DON'T DISAGREE THAT

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:25.245
WE SHOULD PROBABLY LIMIT THE

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:27.080
CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR NOT JUST IN

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:28.048
OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES BUT IN OUR

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:30.917
ALLIES BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S IN --

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:32.385
APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT

01:51:32.452 --> 01:51:34.054
TO BE STEPPING IN AND SORT OF

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.755
TAKING THE PARENTS ROLE IF YOU

01:51:35.822 --> 01:51:38.291
HAVE CHILDREN THEN YOU AND YOU

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:39.225
GO OUT TO EAT WHETHER IT'S AT A

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:40.894
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OR SIT DOWN

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:41.761
RESTAURANT THING YOU HAVE

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:42.362
NOTICED.

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:43.830
THAT MOST OF THESE RESTAURANTS

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:46.066
OFFER CHOICES IT'S NOT JUST A

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.600
SODA THAT THEY GET WITH THE

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:49.769
CHILD'S MAIL THERE MANY CHOICES

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:50.970
AND THEN INCLUDES FAST FOOD

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:52.038
RESTAURANTS IT'S NOT.

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.006
NO LONGER IT'S NOT LIKE WHEN WE

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:55.308
WERE.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:56.076
SO IT WAS THE ONLY OPTION NOW

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:58.845
IT'S CHAU BUT MILK ORANGE JUICE

01:51:58.912 --> 01:52:00.847
OR ITS WATER SO IT'S NOT AS

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.649
THOUGH THIS HAVING A SODA IS

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:04.617
BEING FORCED UPON CHILDREN WHEN

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:05.218
THEY'RE OUT TO EAT WITH THEIR

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.352
PARENTS.

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.655
IT ALSO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:11.524
FACT THAT REALLY IF THERE IS AN

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.926
ABUNDANCE OF SUGAR IN A CHILD'S

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:14.861
DIET LIKELY THAT'S COMING FROM

01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:17.597
HOME BECAUSE MOST KIDS DON'T GO

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:19.332
OUT TO EAT EVERY NIGHT WITH

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:20.433
THEIR PARENTS.

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:21.701
SO IF THEY'RE HAVING TOO MUCH

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:22.869
SUGAR.

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.604
IT'S COMING FROM HOME OR SCHOOL

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:27.240
IT'S NOT COMING FROM GOING OUT

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:28.775
TO EAT SO I'M NOT SURE REALLY

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:29.809
HOW MUCH GOOD THIS WOULD DO

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:32.178
ANYWAY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:34.147
IT IS IMPOSING A FINE ON

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:36.983
RESTAURANT OWNERS BEFORE.

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:39.752
I GUESS FOR NOT TAKING THE PLACE --

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:42.288
OF PARENTS IN FORCING THEM TO

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:42.822
ASSUME THE PARENTS

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:45.058
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CHILD'S

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.426
HEALTHY FOR THAT REASON I WOULD
