00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.207
YOU INVEST IN A CHILD WHEN YOU

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.243
INVEST IN A CHILD YOU INVEST IN

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.811
THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:20.913
NO ARGUMENTS THERE BUT WE HAVE

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.214
PROP NINETY EIGHT WHY DO WE JUST

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:22.982
PAY IT OUT OF THEIR THIS IS WILL

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:25.384
EXPAND.

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:26.585
I'M SORRY WE JUST GET OUT OF

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:27.353
PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THAT

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.588
WE'VE GOT 40% OF THE BUDGET

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.023
DEDICATED TO OUR CHILDREN.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.825
I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THE

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.226
GENERAL FUND WOULD HAVE TO TAKE

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.828
ALMOST TWELVE RECORDS WITH

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:37.129
BILLION IN A NEW EXPENSE AYE I

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.898
WOULD ARGUE THAT.

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.332
PROP NINETY EIGHT IS ENOUGH THE

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.068
FINER EDUCATIONAL.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.269
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA FACTORY

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.004
LOOK [inaudible]

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.807
ABOUT WHAT. FORTY SIX AND FOR

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.008
PEOPLE FUNDING SO IF WE WERE

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:49.909
TAKE THIS MONEY OUT OF

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.477
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.211
FURTHER IMPACT ON THE NEGATIVE

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.412
SIDE.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.013
HOW MUCH WE CAN INVEST IN OUR

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.980
STUDENTS?

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.882
I DON'T ARGUE THAT AT ALL I

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.984
THINK I AGREE WITH YOU THAT PROP

00:11:59.051 --> 00:11:59.618
NINETY EIGHT IS NOT SUFFICIENT

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.619
QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:02.421
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE.

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.290
AND HOW BIG THEIR UNRESTRICTED

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.525
NET DEFICITS ARE IT'S SCARY.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.361
TENSIONS IN THE RETIREE MEDICAL

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.430
JUST KILLING HER OUR DISTRICTS --

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:12.465
BUT I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND MONEY

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:13.732
TO REDUCE THOSE THAT SO THEY CAN

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.733
HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR BUDGETS

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.435
AND LOWER THEIR ANNUAL.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.304
SO IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE SEVEN OF

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.139
THE STAFF REPORTED IT SHOWS THE

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:21.640
TEN LARGEST STATES AND IT SHOWS

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.476
THAT CALIFORNIA.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.977
IS IN THE THREE BOTTOM WHEN IT

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.312
COMES.

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:27.713
TO THE THE AMOUNT OF THAT

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.615
PERSONAL INCOME THE DEBT PER

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.884
CAPITA AND THE DEBT AS A

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.253
PERCENTAGE OF STATE GDP WEEK WE

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.087
ARE WORK.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.122
ALREADY GOT SO MUCH.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.824
THAT COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:39.792
COUNTRY IN.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.393
AND WE HAVE AS A STATE WE HAVE A

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.195
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.697
DOLLAR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:45.164
TALK.

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.298
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.968
FINANCIAL.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.636
STRUCTURE OF THE STATE AND THE

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:51.770

OF THIS LAW THAT THIS LAW EVEN

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:45.514

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:49.997
IN INVESTMENTS -- AND AS A

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:51.765
PUBLIC FINANCE OFFICER WHEN I GO

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.033
OUT AND LOOK AT PROJECTING THOSE

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.369
PROJECTS UNDER FINANCING THAT'S

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.303
CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.372
THE EFFECT IS DONE BASICALLY

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:03.544
DOUBLING THE BUT THE COST OF

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:05.980
THOSE PROJECTS TO THE TAX.

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:06.914
PAIRS OVERTIME.

01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:07.881
UNDER THE PUBLIC MAKING MODEL

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:08.816
THAT WE SEE EN IN THIS BILL IS

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:10.317
MODELED AFTER IN NORTH DAKOTA

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:12.052
MANY OF THIS FINANCING COSTS CAN

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:14.355
BE CUT IN HALF [inaudible]

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:15.923
SO [inaudible]

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:18.158
WHEN?

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:19.660
DEPOSITING A PUBLIC FUNDS I SEE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.195
A PUBLIC BANK IS ONE MORE SAFE

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:22.596
PLACE TO PUT OUR PUBLIC FUNDS

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:24.131
LIKE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:26.300
INVESTMENT POLICIES HAVE MANY

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:27.835
RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE AND HOW WE

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.503
CAN DEPOSIT ANYONE FINANCED.

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.238
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS WAS

MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:33.440
INVESTMENT POLICIES THAT

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:36.310
REQUIRES -- TO LOOK AND EVALUATE

01:38:36.377 --> 01:38:37.778
THOSE INSTITUTIONS BASED ON

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:39.413
THEIR BEHAVIOR.

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.181

WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A KICK ****

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.922
OFF PERSON LAST NAME AN

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:22.823
ORGANIZATION?

I WANT TO GO FIRST A GOOD

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.492
MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:26.827
KAREN LYING ON BEHALF OF THE

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:29.897
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY

01:39:29.963 --> 01:39:31.932
TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS.

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.100
OUR OPPOSITION IS A REALLY

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:34.201
ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:37.705
pAVAILABLE TO PUT INTO A PUBLIC

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.506
BANK SO IT'S CRAZINESS.

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:40.941
FALSE PROMISE THAT.

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:42.743
IF THE LAW PASSES AND THERE'S A

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:44.445
METHOD IN A PROCESS TO GO

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.146
THROUGH THAT A PUBLIC BIG COULD

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:47.514
BE FUNDED WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS.

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.249
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR A

01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:51.852
SOLVENT PUBLIC BANK IS TEN YEARS

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:53.354
OF THE OLD MAXIM MATURITY ON A

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.822
COUNTY INVESTMENT IS.

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:55.956
FIVE SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:57.524
THAT AS THIS LEGISLATION

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:58.892
CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IT IS

01:39:58.959 --> 01:40:01.161
CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT NO PUBLIC

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:02.262
DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY POOL

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:03.897
WILL EVER GO INTO ONE OF THESE

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.299
BANKS TO FIND IT.

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.000
AT THE BEGINNING AND FOR THE

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:09.703
MORE THE COMPLIANCE AND OVERHEAD

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.638
COSTS OF MEETING THE CURRENT

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.607
THINKING RULES ARE VERY

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:14.975
EXPENSIVE.

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.910
AND SO THE THE COST OF DOING

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.112
THAT COMPLAINTS.

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:19.413
CASH FLOW IN THE BANK FOR

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.647
CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:22.649
IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE IN OUR

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:23.917
PRISON THAT THE STUDY WILL SHOW

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.719
THAT THEY HAVE TO DO

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:26.820
INDIVIDUALLY UNDER THE BILL.

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:29.656
I'M I'M NOT CLEAR IF THE STUDY --

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:30.858
IF IT DOES SO THAT IT'S REALLY

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.960
IN FEASIBLE DECIDE TO TAKE IT TO

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:34.962
THE VOTERS.

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:36.363
TO CONFIRM IT'S NOT FEASIBLE OR

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.399
THE STUDY SAYS IT'S NOT FEASIBLE

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:39.066
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT TO THE

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:39.566
VOTERS.

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:41.034
BUT THAT PROPONENTS ARE YOU KNOW

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.237
VERY -- PASSIONATE AND SO

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.072
PRESENT THE DOLLAR TO PASS THIS

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:45.572
COULD BE A LOT OF LOCAL

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.673
GOVERNMENTS ASKED TO FIND A

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.941
LOCAL STUDY.

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:53.747
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE STUDY

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.182
SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT.

01:40:55.249 --> 01:40:56.383
NOT FEASIBLE SO THOSE ARE

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.217
CONCERNS WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:57.851
IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR FROM THE

01:40:57.918 --> 01:40:58.952
GET GO THAT.

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.120
THERE'S NO COUNTY MONEY FOR THIS

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:00.354
HELLO.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:02.489
BUT THAT THE RESPECT ASPIRIN

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:03.357
ABOUT.

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:04.958
THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS THING

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:05.592
WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE COMMENTS

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.261
AND ONE OF THE ITEMS JUST

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:08.862
BROUGHT UP WHERE WAS GOING FOR

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:09.430
THE HEARING COMMITTEE COULD

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:12.599
DECEIVE POLICE FORCE ARE SIR

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:13.734
FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION WELCOME.

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:14.401
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE

01:41:14.468 --> 01:41:15.035
COMMITTEE JASON L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G WITH&lt;/c&gt;

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:15.636
CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:16.270
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:41:16.336 --> 01:41:16.904
TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WERE ON

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.505
THE FOURTH POLICY CAN MANY NOW

01:41:18.572 --> 01:41:20.274
AND WE STILL HAVE YET TO

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.576
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING TO

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:23.811
HAPPEN WHEN A PUBLIC BANK TAKES

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:26.046
ON LOSSES -- AND HAS NOT BEEN

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:27.981
ANSWERED I THINK APPROPRIATELY

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.317
CERTAINLY NOT IF YOU PUT ON A A

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:31.785
BANKING LANDS IN AND ASK THE

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:32.586
QUESTION.

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:33.854
THE ANSWER SEEMED TO BE

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:36.256
INADEQUATE WE'VE HEARD THAT --

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:39.092
THE BILL REQUIRES FDIC INSURANCE --

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:39.760
WE'VE HEARD THAT THE BILL

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:41.695
REQUIRES A FEASIBILITY STUDY BUT

01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:43.163
IN REALITY.

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:44.898
EVERY BANK TAKES ALL LOSSES --

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.733
NO MATTER WHAT THE FEASIBILITY

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.568
STUDY SAYS.

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:50.103
PUBLIC BANK WILL TAKE ON LOSSES

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.072
THE MOST RISK ADVERSE BANK

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.674
OPERATING IN THE MOST SAFE AND

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.944
SOUND MANNER WILL HAVE LOSSES.

01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.412
PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS -- THEY

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:01.348
GET ILL -- AND SO THE QUESTION

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.683
HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED.

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.251
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:06.153
PUBLIC BANK TAKES TAKES ALL

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.855
LOSSES FROM FROM LOANS THAT IT

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:08.856
MAKES.

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:11.291
YOU KNOW IN A IN A IN A PRIVATE

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:13.427
BANK -- THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:16.096
ULTIMATELY ARE THE ONES THAT PUT

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.165
UP THE CAPITAL -- THAT'S

01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:20.033
ESSENTIALLY THE OWNER'S EQUITY --

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.635
SO YOU HAVE SORT OF FDIC

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:22.903
INSURANCE WHICH IS A GOOD THING

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:24.137
BUT THAT ONLY PROTECT YOUR

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.772
DEPOSITORS HE DOESN'T PROTECT

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:27.407
YOUR OWNER'S EQUITY AND IN THE

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:28.642
CASE OF THE PUBLIC BANK THE

01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:30.911
OWNER'S EQUITY IS THE TAXPAYER.

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:32.246
THE TXPAYERS PUTTING UP THE

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:34.181
CAPITAL TO STAND UP THE BANK AND

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.182
WHEN YOU HAVE AN EROSION OF THAT

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:37.317
CAPITAL DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.352
HAVE LOAN LOSSES.

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:40.287
WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:42:40.354 --> 01:42:41.755
GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS INSTANCE

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:42.890
WITH THE STATE HAVE TO COME IN

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:43.824
AND STEP IN AND BACK FILL THOSE

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.359
LOSSES WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.727
HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF ITS OWN

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:48.195
BUDGET. TO BACK FILL THOSE

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:49.830
LOSSES AND IF IT DOES WHAT

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:53.000
HAPPENS OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:53.834
HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING.

01:42:53.901 --> 01:42:56.837
WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS.

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:58.872
RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:01.275
DISPARATE TAX TREATMENT -- FOR A

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:02.109
PUBLIC BANK FIRST AS A PRIVATE

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:02.976
BANK.

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.678
AND THE ANALYSIS EVEN CONCLUDES

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:06.013
THAT THAT PUTS PRIVATE

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:08.415
INSTITUTIONS AT A COMPETITIVE

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.850
DISADVANTAGE TO A PUBLIC BANK.

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.585
THAT'S GOING TO MOST ACUTELY BE

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:13.120
FELT BY YOUR COMMUNITY BANKS

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:15.255
YOUR YOUR STATE CHARTERED

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:17.457
INSTITUTIONS THAT OPERATE IN

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:20.193
CALIFORNIA AND LESS IMPACTFUL

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.796
PROBABLY TO THE LARGER BANKS --

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:23.764
AND THEY FINALLY LET ME JUST SAY

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.899
THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT --

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:27.834
WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT -- THE

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.803
LAST FOUR POLICY COMMITTEES THAT --

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:32.306
THIS IS A A PUBLIC BANK FOR THE

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.373
PUBLIC GOOD.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.641
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WERE NOT

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.743
ALLOWING THE PUBLIC IN CHARTER

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.579
CITIES TO HAVE A SAY.

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.547
IN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT A

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.382
BANK A PUBLIC BANK.

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.684
IN THAT WERE ONLY LIMITING THE

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:46.286
PUBLIC VOTE -- SPECIFICALLY TO

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.955
GENERAL LAS CITIES THAT'S THAT'S

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.756
UNFORTUNATE THE GENERAL US

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:52.025

THE THE BILL BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:46.573
MAY NEED TO STILL BE SOME

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.941
QUESTIONS ON THAT.

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.711
IN CLARIFICATION.

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:51.311
LIKE TO TURN OVER TO SOME OF

YOU HEARD FROM OPPOSITION SURE

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.387
THERE ARE A COUPLE ITEMS ARE

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:01.588
PART OF THE OPPOSITION AND

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.557
ANTICIPATE -- SOME QUESTIONS

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:04.691
ABOUT THAT SO HAPPY DID TO DRILL

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:06.493
DOWN WITH REGARDS TO TO TAX

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.495
TREATMENT IT IS NOT TYPICAL THAT

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:09.863
WE WOULD TAX.

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.898
OF PUBLIC ENTITIES -- AND AND

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:14.668
CLEARLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:15.969
LOCAL JURISDICTION.

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:19.639
THAT DECIDES TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:21.007
TO HELP CAPITALIZE THE BANK.

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.476
IT WOULD BE UNORTHODOX TO

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.311
SUGGEST THAT WE OUGHT TO TAX OUR

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:27.013
PUBLIC DOLLARS -- AND I WOULD

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.281
SAY WE WOULD BE TREATING THE

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:29.850
PUBLIC BANKS I WAS WE WOULD

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:32.219
CREDIT UNIONS WHICH ALSO ARE NOT

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.987
SUBJECTED TO TAXES SO -- THAT'S

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.856
OBVIOUSLY A POLICY CALL -- BUT

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:37.257
ONE THAT WE THINK MAKES SENSE

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:39.025
WITH REGARDS TO THE ANTICIPATION

01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.660
OF LOSSES AS THE CHAIRMAN JUST

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:41.561
SAID.

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:44.431
THE PROCESS TO APPLY FOR CHARTER

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.867
WOULD INVOLVE THE ANALYSIS IN

01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:50.070
THE FEASIBILITY STUDY -- THE

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:51.571
PUTTING TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN

01:46:51.638 --> 01:46:53.840
AND THOSE TWO ITEMS WOULD BE

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:56.843
REQUIRED BEFORE SAY LOCAL CITY

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.178
COUNCIL WOULD WOULD APPROVE IT.

01:46:58.245 --> 01:47:00.013
CLEARLY THE QUESTION THAT WAS

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.047
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION OF WHAT

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:03.650
HAPPENS WITH LOSSES THOSE WOULD

01:47:03.717 --> 01:47:05.018
BE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS.

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:06.620
THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.655
ADDRESSED IN A BUSINESS PLAN IN

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:10.123
A FEASIBILITY STUDY.

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:11.625
AND CERTAINLY QUESTIONS THAT A

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.059
PUBLIC WOULD WANT TO KNOW --

01:47:13.126 --> 01:47:15.729
BEFORE SAY A CITY COUNCIL WERE

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:18.098
TO VOTE ON IT -- FOR AS A VOTERS

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.100
WOULD CONSIDER IT AT THE BALLOT

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:22.435
BOX SO I WOULD -- THESE WOULD BE

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:24.471
ADDRESSED -- THROUGH THAT

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.006
PROCESS -- I THINK THOSE WERE

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:27.541
PROBABLY THE TWO MAIN ISSUES

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:28.608
THAT I HEARD.

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:30.744
REYES BY THE OPPOSITION BUT

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:31.912

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:33.547

BUT WE GET ALL THIS ANALYSIS WE

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:17.677
LOOK AT ALL THE COSTS.

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:20.547
IN AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:22.315
COST BENEFIT WAS TO MINIMAL IT

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:23.850
WAS JUST IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING

01:50:23.917 --> 01:50:25.385
BUT IT WASN'T.

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:27.053
ENOUGH TO SAY OKAY HOW DO WE

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.888
TAKE ON ALL THE RISK ALL THE

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.457
ACTIVITY.

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:31.891
ALL THE AUDITS.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.560
ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:34.961
AND IF WE HAVE ONE LITTLE BLIP

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.830
THEN WE HAVE A LOSS AND HOW DO

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:38.565
WE JUSTIFY THAT.

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.033
SO WAS IN A FUN EXPERIENCE SO

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:41.434
IT'S KIND OF FUN THAT ALL THESE

01:50:41.501 --> 01:50:42.369
MEMORIES.

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:44.537
COME BACK -- SO MEMBERS TO IN

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:47.907
SANTIAGO YOU KNOW DOING THIS

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:48.541
TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE YOU

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.443
WERE BORN.

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.311
AND A AND M..

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:53.213
AND NOW LOOKING AT AT THIS AS A

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:53.413
BILL.

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.115
SAW.

01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:57.250
I'M COMING FROM MY OWN PERSONAL

01:50:57.317 --> 01:50:59.352
EXPERIENCE OF HAVING GONE

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:00.553
THROUGH AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY --

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.422
EVEN SURPRISING MY LEGAL COUNSEL

01:51:02.489 --> 01:51:04.357
WHO RIDE WE WOULDN'T GET AS FAR

01:51:04.424 --> 01:51:05.892
AS WE EVEN DID JUST.

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:06.926
THAT.

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.695
THERE WAS AT LEAST SOME

01:51:08.762 --> 01:51:11.364
RECEPTIVE ATTY THE IDEA BUT WHAT

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:13.033
AND THEN IT CAME BACK TO HOW DO

01:51:13.099 --> 01:51:14.768
I DEAL WITH MY C. E. O. AT THE

01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:15.368
COUNTY.

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:18.405
AND AND AND AND AT THAT TIME I

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:19.305
WAS HAVING.

01:51:19.372 --> 01:51:20.340
TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT WERE

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:21.207
UPSET WHEN THEY WERE THIRTY

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:21.474
HEARING.

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.276
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT IT

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.011
WAS LIKE OKAY THIS IS NOT A CORE

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:26.780
THIS IS NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:28.448
GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW?

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:29.883
AND SO.

01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:33.053
BECAUSE THE COST FOR THE SAVINGS

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:34.154
WERE AT THE END OF THE DAY NOT.

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.088
THEY WERE JUST TWO HUNDRED

01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:35.955
THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE END OF

01:51:36.022 --> 01:51:37.357
THE DAY DOING ALL THAT.

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:38.625
AND I SAID I THAT DOESN'T MAKE

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:41.594
SENSE TO START A BANK SO I I I

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:42.595
COMING FROM THAT BACKGROUND I

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.064
LOOKED AT I LOOKED AT ALL THE

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.765
BENEFITS THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:46.366
THE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD DO

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:47.167
THIS.

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:49.335
I KEEP TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:50.236
COMMUNITIES FROM WHICH THEY ARE

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:50.904
SOURCED.

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.872
THAT'S DOUBTFUL -- BECAUSE ALL

01:51:52.939 --> 01:51:54.007
THE MONEY.

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:56.676
IT'S ACTUALLY A INVESTED IN --

01:51:56.743 --> 01:51:58.478
CASH EQUIVALENTS YOU GOT TO KEEP

01:51:58.545 --> 01:51:58.912
YOUR MONEY.

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:01.081
EARNING MONEY WHICH MEANS THAT --

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.115
YOU KNOW YOU DIVEST FROM

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.550
INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS THE

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:04.617
INDIAN CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:08.288
GOVERNMENT VALUES BUT YOU MIGHT-BE THERE JUST WITH WHERE THE

01:52:08.354 --> 01:52:09.722
MONEY IS BEING INVESTED.

01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:11.057
LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE FEES PAID

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.992
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT TO LARGE

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:14.461
BANKS I THINK THE SAVINGS ARE

01:52:14.527 --> 01:52:16.162
MINIMAL INCREASE THE LENDING

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:17.630
CAPACITY OF LOCAL.

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.332
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS VIA

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:19.933
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PUBLIC

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:22.035
BANK BUT THEN YOU HAVE EXPOSURE

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.070
TO LOAN LOSSES WHICH IS A WHOLE

01:52:24.137 --> 01:52:25.138
NOTHER DISCUSSION.

01:52:25.205 --> 01:52:26.439
STRENGTHENED SMALL BUSINESS

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:27.974
LENDING COMMUNITIES BY OFFERING

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:29.876
LOANS PERHAPS IT WILL MARKET

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:32.145
RATES ND I I ALSO SAY THAT'S A

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:32.912
MAYBE.

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:34.981
AND ADDRESS LOCAL LOCALITIES

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:36.116
INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING NEEDS AND

01:52:36.182 --> 01:52:37.917
I SAID THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:52:37.984 --> 01:52:39.285
PROBABLY A POSITIVE I WOULDN'T

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:40.954
SEE IT AS A AS A MAJOR POSITIVE.

01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:41.821
SO I JUST PUT THAT ALL OTHER

01:52:41.888 --> 01:52:43.523
MISTER CHAIR JUST THIS CONTEXT

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.558
OF THE HISTORY THAT I'VE ENJOYED

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:47.694
AND AND SO WITH THAT I I WILL

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.463
I'LL BE OPPOSED BECAUSE I JUST.

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.365
I I I I GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:54.167
TO DO BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT AS

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:56.769
BEING A IN SOMETHING THAT.

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:57.937
IS BENEFICIAL AT THE END OF THE

01:52:58.004 --> 01:52:59.806
DAY TO TAXPAYERS TO TO TO

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.040
COMPETE IN THE BROAD SCHEME OF

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:02.008
THINGS.

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:04.110
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO I

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:04.911

JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.714
HISTORY OF ALL THE FUN.

THAT TESSA MEMBERS CHIU AND

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:11.251
SANTIAGO HAD A LOT OF FUN

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.519
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE

01:53:12.585 --> 01:53:14.187
IT'S A BIG PROJECT SO THANK YOU

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:15.788
MISTER CHAIR OF THE BILL.

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:17.123
WE HAVE A MOTION THE FLOOR BY

01:53:17.190 --> 01:53:18.625
CENTER WIENER -- WILL HAVE

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:20.260
DECEMBER CHEWED TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:20.326 --> 01:53:21.427
COMMENT ON THE YEAR.

01:53:21.494 --> 01:53:23.463
LIFTED RESPONDED TO SOME OF THAT

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.098
AND AND LOVE HEARING ABOUT THAT

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:26.499
THAT YOUR EXERIENCE AND AND

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:28.067
HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:29.235
THAT A LITTLE MORE LET ME SEE

01:53:29.302 --> 01:53:37.343
REALLY. THREE THINGS FIRST WE DO

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:38.344
KNOW THAT THE PROCESS. FOR ANY

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:39.145
LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MOVE FOR

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:39.779
WITH THE CHART OF A PUBLIC BANK

01:53:39.846 --> 01:53:40.680
IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY NO BONES

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:41.247
ABOUT IT I HAVE SAID THAT.

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.315
THE I THINK THE RISK WITH THIS

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:43.816
LEGISLATION AS WE HAVE PLACE SO

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:44.984
MANY REQUIREMENTS.

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.886
ON WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO CHARTER

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:48.755
PUBLIC BANK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:49.722
THE END OF FIVE OR TEN YEARS

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:50.490
FROM NOW.

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.692
NO LOCAL JURISDICTION MAY BE

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:53.326
SUCCESSFUL AT THAT BECAUSE IT'S

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:54.460
HARD.

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:55.161
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:57.130
REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T TRY AND

01:53:57.197 --> 01:53:59.599
AND AND AND WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.201
PUBLIC BANKS AT THIS TIME IN

01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:02.602
CALIFORNIA.

01:54:02.669 --> 01:54:04.137
IN ADDITION TO THE EXAMPLE OF

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:05.738
THE SUCCESS OF THE PUBLIC BANK

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:08.675
EXPERIENCE IN IN NORTH DAKOTA.

01:54:08.741 --> 01:54:10.343
THESE ARE THE SAME QUESTIONS

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:11.978
THAT WERE SUGGESTED BEFORE WHEN

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:12.912
WE JUST HAD A PRIVATE HEALTH

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.881
SYSTEM THAT DIDN'T WORK ABOUT

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:15.481
SUGGESTING WE NEED TO MOVE FOR

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:18.117
WITH THE OR BEFORE WE HAD A

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.052
PUBLIC TRANSIT.

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:20.486
BEFORE PUBLIC TRANSIT WAS A

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:22.121
CONCEPT OVER FOR PUBLIC

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:25.425
EDUCATION WAS A CONCEPT.

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:26.526
YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:27.894
IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO LET ME

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:29.195
JUST SAY A FEW THINGS WHAT IS

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:30.530
HAPPENED WITHIN THE BANKING

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.198
INDUSTRY IN SPECIFICALLY.

01:54:32.265 --> 01:54:33.199
WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH WALL STREET

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:34.634
BANKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.803
CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST DECADE SO

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:38.605
THAT WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO.

01:54:38.671 --> 01:54:39.906
IN THE PAST DECADE WE'VE HAD

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:41.841
MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS HAVE

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:43.576
EXPERIENCED PREDATORY LENDING.

01:54:43.643 --> 01:54:45.144
WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:46.613
ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:48.514
WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:50.483
WHO'VE LOST. FIVE HUNDRED

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:51.551
BILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST

01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:53.152
PAYMENTS AFTER THE GREAT

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:54.454
RECESSION.

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.722
WE'VE HAD.

01:54:55.788 --> 01:54:57.090
AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS

01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.691
WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:00.226
MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:01.527
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:02.795
GREEDY LENDERS.

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:04.530
SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:06.032
DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.167
AND THE PUBLIC WHOSE MONIES ARE

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:09.669
CURRENTLY BEING INVESTED AGAINST

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:11.704
THEIR VALUES AND FOSSIL FUEL

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:12.705
INDUSTRIES WITH GUN

01:55:12.772 --> 01:55:14.107
MANUFACTURERS WITH PRIVATE

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.141
PRISONS.

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:16.442
WITH COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:18.411
PRACTICES WITHIN THE PAST DECADE

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:21.547
SOMETHING IS TRULY BROKEN.

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:23.049
WITH THE PRIVATE BANKING SYSTEM.

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:25.318
AND I ALSO STE I JUST MENTION

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:26.052
THAT -- OVER THE PAST TWENTY

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:28.921
YEARS THE LARGEST WALL STREET

01:55:28.988 --> 01:55:29.856
BANKS HAVE.

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:32.191
PUSHED OUT 75% OF CALIFORNIA

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:33.259
LOCAL BANKS.

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:36.062
SO SOMETHING'S FUNDAMENTALLY

01:55:36.129 --> 01:55:37.797
BROKEN SINCE YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.898
FROM TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO AND

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:39.932
WHAT WE ARE SAYING S AT THIS

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:41.000
TIME.

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:43.336
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE WANT

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:43.936
TO EXPLORE IF THERE'S A

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:45.271
DIFFERENT WAY IT WILL BE

01:55:45.338 --> 01:55:46.639
DIFFICULT IT WILL BE HARD.

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:48.041
BUT WE THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:50.743
THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND WE HOPE

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:52.312
BY ASKING THESE QUESTIONS EITHER.

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:53.279
THERE ARE SUCCESSES AND

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:55.248
ESTABLISHING.

01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:57.483
LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS FOR THE WALL

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:58.685
STREET BANKS.

01:55:58.751 --> 01:56:00.453
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES TO BE

ARE PROFESSIONALLY ADVISED AND

01:58:44.584 --> 01:58:45.918
SQUEEZE THE HECK.

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:50.656
OUT OF PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS. TO

CHALLENGING.

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.672
SO I'M VERY SKEPTICAL AND

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:07.707
DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A

01:59:07.773 --> 01:59:10.810
PUBLIC BANK STRUCTURE WORKS.

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.578

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:27.693
IT'S THE GENERAL FUND OF THE

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.262
STATE THAT GUARANTEES THE

01:59:29.328 --> 01:59:31.297
DEPOSITS OF CREDITORS OF

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.577
THAT BEING SAID.

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.078

THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I I

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:50.276
THINK YOUR QUESTION FRAMES

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:52.011
EXACTLY WHY THERE IS SO MUCH

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:53.445
SUPPORT FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD

02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:55.514
AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:56.916
ABOUT OUR LOWEST INCOME.

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.751
CALIFORNIANS BUT IT'S ABOUT MOST

02:05:58.817 --> 02:06:01.053
INCOMES ARE OUTSIDE OF THE TOP

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.388
1% WHO DO NOT FEEL LIKE THE

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:03.589
CURRENT.

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:04.790
BANKING SYSTEM THAT'S BEING

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:06.425
DRIVEN BY WALL STREET BANKS ARE

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:08.494
SERVING THEIR NEEDS.

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:11.597
AS I ALLUDED TO BEFORE -- THE

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.732
SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL COMES FROM

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.301
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:16.468
DON'T THINK THAT THE PREDATORY

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:17.770
LENDING PRACTICES THAT THEY'VE

02:06:17.836 --> 02:06:18.570
SEEN FROM WALL STREET OUR

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:19.972
ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS CERTAINLY

02:06:20.039 --> 02:06:21.440
THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:22.641
CALIFORNIANS.

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:23.909
WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.878
AND HOUSING THE FACT THAT THERE

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:27.246
IS SO LITTLE?

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:28.847
ACCESS TO CAPITAL FROM WALL

02:06:28.914 --> 02:06:30.282
STREET BANKS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:32.184
HOUSING TO DRESSER HOMELESSNESS

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.986
CRISIS AND AGAIN THE LOWEST

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.254
INCOME CALIFORNIANS.

02:06:35.321 --> 02:06:37.089
IS IS IS A MAJOR REASON WHY

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.190
REMOVING FOR WITH THIS I WILL

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.191
MENTION.

02:06:39.258 --> 02:06:42.995
BEFORE THE THE ARE ARE -- RECENT

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:44.396
DEPARTED MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:46.365
MAYOR LEE BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:47.599
HE HAD.

02:06:47.666 --> 02:06:48.934
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:50.869
HE WANTED ME TO CARRY A BILL. TO

02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:52.771
PUSH WALL STREET ANKS TO DO A

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:54.173
BETTER JOB.

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:55.841
AND AND I KNOW ACTION FOUR OF US --

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:57.710
IS A LOBBYIST FOR THE CITY

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:58.277
COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AND SHE%

02:06:58.344 --> 02:06:58.978
KNEW.

02:06:59.044 --> 02:07:01.080
THAT MERELY HAD WANTED US TO

02:07:01.146 --> 02:07:02.681
MOVE FOR THE BILL -- TO PUSH

02:07:02.748 --> 02:07:05.117
WALL STREET BANKS TO PROVIDE LOW

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:06.819
OR NO INTEREST LOANS TO CITIES

02:07:06.885 --> 02:07:07.419
TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:11.256
CRISIS DATA SOMETHING PUBLIC

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:11.623
BANKS COULD DO.

02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:14.560
I SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE.

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:16.962
THE CHALLENGE IN RECENT YEARS IN.

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:19.131
IN BEING ABLE TO EMPLOY OUR

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:20.666
LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:21.900
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:22.735
TO CAPITAL TO EXPAND THEIR

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:25.971
BUSINESSES FROM THIS SECTOR.

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:28.073
AND STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:30.142
MOVE UP THE EDUCATIONAL LADDER

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:31.877
SO THEY CAN GET THE JOBS THAT

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:32.845
THEY NEED TO PUT FOOD ON THE

02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:33.579
TABLE.

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:36.415
THEY HAVE BEN NOT MET BY WHAT

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:37.149
ARE WALL STREET BANKS ARE DOING

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:40.085
SO -- WE FOR STRUCTURE THIS BILL

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:41.754
TO REQUIRE.

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:44.156
A PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC BANK TO

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:45.557
DELINEATE WHAT WHO THEY'RE

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:47.359
TRYING TO SERVE AS A MOVE FOR

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:48.427
WHETHER IT BE.

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:50.429
THE HOUSING SECTOR WHETHER BE

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:51.964
PREDATORY LENDERS WHETHER BE

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.966
SMALL BUSINESSES SO THIS WOULD

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:55.401
BE LAID OUT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN.

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:57.302
PROPOSED TO CITY COUNCILS

02:07:57.369 --> 02:07:58.270
PROPOSED TO VOTERS FOR THEIR

02:07:58.337 --> 02:08:00.639
SUPPORT BUT IT IS EXACTLY THE

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:01.240
REASON WHY WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.441
THIS NOW BUT LET ME.

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:03.876
AND WITH ONE FINAL THANKS WE'RE

02:08:03.942 --> 02:08:05.544
NOT TRYING TO DO IS TRY TO WE'RE

02:08:05.611 --> 02:08:07.012
NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE TYPICAL

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.447
RETAIL SERVICES THAT ARE

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:09.581
CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED.

TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:08:16.288 --> 02:08:17.222
BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:19.425
ENSURE THAT WHAT THE BANKING

02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:20.959
INDUSTRY SAYS THAT THERE DO

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.494
WHICH IS PROVIDE CAPITAL.

02:08:22.561 --> 02:08:23.796

THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY WHATHAPPENS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.939
HAPPENING NOW WHICH IS PUBLIC

02:08:34.006 --> 02:08:35.374

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.508
EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET WE

02:10:16.575 --> 02:10:20.245
CONSIDER INCREASES [inaudible]

02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:21.914
FOUR COST OF LIVING.

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:24.116
FOR PEOPLE ON THE LATTER ENACT.

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.552
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND ON SSI

02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:28.253
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT EVERY YEAR

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.922

AND IT'S ALWAYS A BIG FIGHT.

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:37.362
AND WE HAD ONE YEAR AT ONE POINT

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:38.830
WHERE THE PROGRAMS FOR LETTERMAN

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:40.098

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:42.100
IT WAS SIXTEEN YEARS WITHOUT AN

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:45.103
INCREASE SIXTEEN YEARS WENT BY.

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:48.340
WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN FINALLY --

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:49.775
BY SOME PEOPLE.

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:53.278
CHAINING HIMSELF TO THE BARE.

02:10:53.345 --> 02:10:54.046

UNACCEPTABLE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:20.532

IS IN POVERTY SOMEBODY'S ON SSI

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:23.435
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BANKING

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:26.071
SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD CHARGE --

02:12:26.138 --> 02:12:28.707
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT HIGH

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:30.042
OF A FEE JUST TO ACCESS DOLLARS

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:31.543
WELL I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION

02:12:31.610 --> 02:12:35.647

BUT BUT I TELL TELL YOU AMONGST.

02:12:39.551 --> 02:12:41.687
ONE OF THE VERY MANY REASONS AS

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:43.188
TO WHY -- I WAS.

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:45.590
MOVED TO ADD COME BARK ON THIS

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:46.658
NEW IDEA.

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.026
I'M IN A LOT OF US OF LAID OUT

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:49.995
OF HER REASONS AND WE SEE

02:12:50.062 --> 02:12:51.863
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND WE SEE.

02:12:51.930 --> 02:12:53.565
ALMOST POPULATION AND WE SEE

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:55.267
PEOPLE AS A SIGN WE SEE THAT THE

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:56.568
SYSTEM DOES NOT WORKING FOLKS I

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:57.769
MEAN THE BOTTOM LINE IS NOT

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:58.804
WORKING FOR FOLKS WE'RE NOW THE

02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.405
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY.

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:02.207
IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE THE

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:04.376
LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION WE

02:13:04.443 --> 02:13:07.079
HAVE RENTS ARE SKYROCKETING AND

02:13:07.145 --> 02:13:07.779
AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.147
PUBLIC BANK ISN'T FIX ALL THIS

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:11.416
RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE STEP IT'S ONE

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:12.651
THING BUT WE CAN CHECK A SYSTEM

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:14.486
A WE CAN FIND A DIFFERENT WAY IN

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:14.686
A NEW.

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:16.121
WAY OF DOING THINGS BECAUSE

02:13:16.188 --> 02:13:17.389
WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE THE STATUS

02:13:17.456 --> 02:13:19.324
QUO AT THAT HAD MANY

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.692
CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH PEOPLE.

02:13:20.759 --> 02:13:21.626
WHO SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE AND

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:22.861
WE ALL AGREE WE GOT A CHALLENGE

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.830
JUST AS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IS NOT WORKING FOR&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:26.898
FOLKS THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE?

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:28.600
AND AN END WHEN I BEFORE I WAS

02:13:28.667 --> 02:13:32.904
IN PUBLIC OFFICE -- IN THE

02:13:32.971 --> 02:13:34.005
ASSEMBLY.

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:35.674
I REMEMBER -- IN WHERE THE

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:36.675
NEIGHBORHOODS AND I REPRESENT --

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:38.310
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE SENIOR

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:38.944
HOUSING PROJECT THAT WAS COMING

02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:40.112
UP.

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:42.514
AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED I WENT --

02:13:42.581 --> 02:13:44.049
WAS IN AN OFFICE YEAH BUT I

02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:45.016
COULDN'T DEAL WITH THAT TRY TO

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:46.451
DUPLICATE THE SORT OF WORK.

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:48.220
AND DURING THE SPEECHES I HAD

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:49.621
HEARD THAT IT TOOK US SEVEN OR

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:51.356
EIGHT YEARS TO PUT THE FINANCING

02:13:51.423 --> 02:13:52.791
TOGETHER FOR THIS PROJECT AND I

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:54.025
WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:55.727
ALTHOUGH I KNEW HOW BENEFICIAL

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:56.728
WAS TO THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:57.562
LESS.

02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:58.730
THAN A HUNDRED UNITS COME UP AT

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:00.232
THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO PUT A

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.967
FINANCING MECHANISM FOR THAT

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:04.403
MANY YEARS -- FOR SENIOR HOUSING

02:14:04.469 --> 02:14:05.537
JUST DROVE ME NUTS AND I THOUGHT

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.305
TO MYSELF BUT WHEN WE WERE

02:14:07.372 --> 02:14:11.009
EMBARKING ON THIS -- IT LOOK.

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:12.411
THE WALL STREET BRAND BUT BANK

02:14:12.477 --> 02:14:13.812
IS IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS

02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:15.947
IN IT'S GOING TO TRY THE YIELD

02:14:16.014 --> 02:14:17.449
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PROFIT

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:18.550
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IT'S THE

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:19.151
PROFIT MOTIVE IT'S HOW THEY

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:19.918
OPERATE.

02:14:19.985 --> 02:14:21.753
BUT BUT WHAT ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:22.888
THAT SAYS THIS IS WHAT THE NEED

02:14:22.954 --> 02:14:24.256
IS IN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:25.957
COMMUNITIES MAYBE WE'RE NOT

02:14:26.024 --> 02:14:26.958
YELLING THE BEST RETURN BUT IT'S

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:28.827
THE IT'S A PUBLIC GOAL IT AND WE

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:29.728
CAN HELP.

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.663
FINANCE -- US A FOUR WHEEL

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:32.864
HOUSING UNITS WE CAN HELP THE

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:35.033
FINANCE -- SENIOR HOUSE IN THIS

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:35.667
PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS SENIOR

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:36.401
HOUSING.

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:37.769
LOOK IN IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:39.070
HEALTH FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP.

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:40.705
IT'S THAT ONE BRIDGE LOAN THAT

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.274
HELPS THE HELPS TO MOVE THE

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:43.508
CONVERSATION FOR FOR SOMEBODY TO

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.877
HAVE A TO BE ABLE -- TO PURCHASE

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.112
A HOME I'M I'M REALLY NOT THAT

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:48.246
SO I HAVE A LOT OF HOPES AND

02:14:48.313 --> 02:14:49.714
ASPIRATIONS ULTIMATELY ALL NOT

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:50.849
BE ABLE TO TERMINATE BECAUSE THE

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.684
LOCAL MUNICIPALITY WILL BE ABLE

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:53.485
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS PUBLIC GOOD

02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:53.919
IS.

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:55.954
BUT I THINK IT I I THINK IT

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:56.788
BEHOOVES US.

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.089
AS LITTLE AS THE FIFTH LARGEST

02:14:58.156 --> 02:14:59.524
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO TRY TO

02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:00.358
SOLVE.

02:15:00.425 --> 02:15:01.893
SOME OF THESE -- SOCIAL PROBLEMS

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.528
THAT WE HAD AND AND YOU'VE GOT

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:05.197
TO START BY SHAKING UP THE

02:15:05.263 --> 02:15:05.797
SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

02:15:05.864 --> 02:15:07.065
WE'RE DOING HERE. TO FIND A NEW

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.467
WAY TO DO IT.

02:15:08.533 --> 02:15:10.769
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR FOLKS WE

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:11.803
GET IT WE HAVE.

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:14.072
A REAL QUICK SO WE HAVE --

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:14.739
CENTER TARA WOULD LIKE TO TO

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:15.907
SPEAK IF THAT WORKS ALREADY

02:15:15.974 --> 02:15:21.713
GOING TO CENTER HERTZBERG AND

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:23.582
HER TIME.

02:15:23.648 --> 02:15:26.418
THE CHAIR I SO I EIGHT SUPPORT

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:27.552
THE EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:29.154
CONCEPT RIGHT -- I JUST.

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:30.856
I REPRESENT THE SENATE DISTRICT

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.524
THAT IS.

02:15:32.591 --> 02:15:34.659
SUPER IMPOVERISHED WE STRUGGLE

02:15:34.726 --> 02:15:37.629
WITH GETTING JUST ENOUGH MONEY.

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:39.331
OUR BASIC NEEDS LIKE.

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:42.100
WATER AND AND AND AND HEALTH

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:44.936
CARE -- AND MY CONCERN WITH THIS

02:15:45.003 --> 02:15:47.506
THIS BILL IS.

02:15:47.572 --> 02:15:50.609
THE LOS OBVIOUSLY -- BUT ALSO I

02:15:50.675 --> 02:15:51.209
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF I

02:15:51.276 --> 02:15:52.911
SUPPORT.

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:55.113
A BILL LIKE THIS BUT IT WORKS

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:56.815
FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA.

02:15:56.882 --> 02:15:59.284
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TRYING

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:00.685
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS.

02:16:00.752 --> 02:16:02.354
FOR A POPULATION THAT I

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:06.458
REPRESENT -- I MY DISTRICT MY

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:09.194
COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:10.829
CONTINUE ON THE PATH.

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.230
TOWARDS GETTING A PUBLIC BANK

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:13.765
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

02:16:13.832 --> 02:16:14.866
FUNDS.

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:21.506
AND SO I I AM NOT OPPOSED TO TO

02:16:21.573 --> 02:16:23.041
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO YOU IN.

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:24.910
AND CONCEPT AYE AYE.

02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:26.311
I DON'T DISAGREE.

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:28.613
BUT I WANT TO GET TO A PLACE AND

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.715
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN TO

SUPPORT IT.

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:35.020
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:36.655
ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:37.756

DAKOTA CHOSE AT THAT TIME TO

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:31.009
MOVE FOR WITH THE MODEL THAT IS

02:17:31.076 --> 02:17:31.576
WORKING FOR THEM AND WORKING

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:34.546
WELL -- SECONDLY IF THERE ARE

02:17:37.215 --> 02:17:37.949
POTENTIALLY MAKE IT MORE

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.851
WORKABLE THIS BILL DOESN'T FORCE

IT SIMPLY PROVIDES CHOICE.

02:17:43.388 --> 02:17:44.656
AND IF THERE ARE LOCAL

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.024

LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT SIDE.

02:19:21.386 --> 02:19:22.053
AS TO WHETHER WE CAN SUPPORT THE

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:22.287

02:19:22.353 --> 02:19:23.121
SECOND SIDE IS WHAT YOU DO THE

THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF WAYS

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:35.567
EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:36.668
FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS THE LIKE.

02:19:36.735 --> 02:19:38.503
YOU TALK TO THE THE BEST

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:39.938
THINKERS IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY.

02:19:40.004 --> 02:19:41.873
YOU LITERALLY CAN DO BETTER RISK

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:43.675
PROFILES DETERMINING WHAT PEOPLE

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:44.976
DO ON THE INTERNET.

02:19:45.043 --> 02:19:48.947
THEN YOU CAN BASED UPON -- THEIR

02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.248

PAY YOUR YOUR YOUR UTILITY BILL

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:54.953
IT DOESN'T GET THE DECISION OF A

CREDIT CARD DOESN'T SAY YOU PAY

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:57.355

02:19:57.422 --> 02:19:58.189

THERE'S A NUMBER OF NEW

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:01.526
METHODOLOGIES SO WHEN WE LOOK TO

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:03.628
EXT TO TO SOLVE THE CHALLENGES

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:05.096
THAT WE ARE FACING.

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.531
THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE WITH LESS

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:11.569
MEANS IN ALL OF THOSE A

02:20:11.636 --> 02:20:13.071
REVOLUTION MY ONLY

02:20:13.138 --> 02:20:14.439
RECOMMENDATION.

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:15.840
YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOME OF THE

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.308
STUFF IS TO TRADITIONAL BANKING.

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:19.544
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS THINK

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:21.346
ABOUT IT PLATE WHAT WAYS THAT WE

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:22.313
HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:23.481
IN IN IN.

02:20:23.548 --> 02:20:24.849
IN KENYA AND AFGHANISTAN THEY

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:26.451
ALL THE SOLDIERS GET PAID ON THE

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:27.819
TELEPHONE SO THIS IS THE

02:20:27.886 --> 02:20:29.053
GENERAL'S CAN'T STEAL THE MONEY.

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:30.855
TRANSACTION COSTS ARE FRACTIONS

02:20:30.922 --> 02:20:32.090
OF A PENNY COMPARE WOULD PEOPLE

02:20:32.157 --> 02:20:33.658
PAY NOW THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:36.294
CREDIT ABILITY FOR SOMEONE ON A

02:20:36.361 --> 02:20:37.796
CAL FRESH TO GET THEIR MONEY ON

02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:38.930
THE PHONE.

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:41.566
AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND MOST

02:20:41.633 --> 02:20:43.001
EVERYBODY HAS AND IF NOT.

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:43.568
IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:44.102
SHOULD GIVE YOU THE PHONE

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:44.903
BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN THE

02:20:44.969 --> 02:20:46.271
OTHER THINGS TO THE POINT YOU

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.272
RAISE WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE

02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:48.239
WITH LESS MONEY.

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:50.175
THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT THE

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:52.010
OPPORTUNITIES GREAT PEOPLE THE

02:20:52.076 --> 02:20:52.811
MIDDLE AGAIN AGAINST THE MIDDLE

02:20:52.877 --> 02:20:54.546
PEOPLE CAN GET SQUEEZED AND THIS

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:55.046
TO ME.

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:56.748
IS SOMETHING IS YOU BEGIN TO

02:20:56.815 --> 02:20:58.683
ANALYZE THIS AND I SUSPECT

02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:59.284
HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:00.919
INVOLVED TO REALLY ENGAGE

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:02.353
BECAUSE THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:08.126
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:08.693
TO TAKE CARE OF FOLKS GOING

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:10.562
FORWARD.

02:21:10.628 --> 02:21:11.830
THIS WINTER LITERATURE

02:21:11.896 --> 02:21:12.564
MISALIGNED THE BANKERS

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:13.665
ASSOCIATION THANK YOU I JUST

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:15.667
WANTED TO RESPOND AS SENATOR

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:18.303
BILLS COMMENTS -- CALIFORNIA IS

02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:19.871
IN FACT AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:20.872
PLACE TO LIVE AND THAT IS NOT

02:21:20.939 --> 02:21:24.742
LOST ON ME AS A RESIDENT AND

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:25.577
BUT THE INDUSTRY IS.

02:21:25.643 --> 02:21:27.545
IF NOT THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:29.781
HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:31.516
THE UNITED STATES ITS BINS

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:34.319
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:21:34.385 --> 02:21:36.955
IN COMPLIANCE COSTS ALONE.

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:39.657
IT HAS C. R. A. OBLIGATIONS

02:21:39.724 --> 02:21:42.093
FULLY AT THE EFFORT IT PAYS

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.194
TAXES.

02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:43.962
THE INDUSTRY PAYS IT'S EMPLOYEES

02:21:44.028 --> 02:21:45.630
HIGHER WAGES THAN THE MINIMUM

02:21:45.697 --> 02:21:47.065
WAGE.

02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:49.000
IT IS FANCIFUL TO THINK THAT A

02:21:49.067 --> 02:21:50.869
PUBLIC BANK WON'T SIMILARLY HOW

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:51.936
AFTER INCURRING THOSE COMPLIANCE

02:21:52.003 --> 02:21:53.905
COSTS AND IT WON'T HAVE TO

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:55.206
CHARGE FEES.

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:59.811
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE.

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:00.778
RELATIVE TO THE COMMENT MADE

02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:01.846
THAT THE PUBLIC THINKS THAT THE

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.181
INDUSTRY HAS FAILED IT.

02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:04.315
THE DATA DOESN'T BEAR THAT OUT

02:22:04.382 --> 02:22:05.650
THE POLLING THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:07.352
BY SOME FAIRLY WELL KNOWN

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:08.653
POLLSTERS SAY THAT THE VAST

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.688
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE

02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:12.423
THAT THEY ARE BEING SERVED.

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:13.958
BY THEIR CREDIT UNIONS AND THEIR

02:22:14.025 --> 02:22:16.027

IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:41.412
GIVEN HE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD

02:23:41.479 --> 02:23:43.348
SUCH A HARD TIME.

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:45.216

AND I'D BE WILLING TO CONSIDER A

02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:15.413
PUBLIC [inaudible]

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:17.215
BANK OPTION.

02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:19.350
I THINK THERE IS.

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:20.685
SOMETHING IS WILLING.

02:24:20.752 --> 02:24:22.086
TO WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:23.755
EXPLORE THE SUBJECT SO THAT'S

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:25.990
WHY I WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL.

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:26.991
THANKS SO MUCH FOR CENTER WITH A

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:28.026

02:24:28.092 --> 02:24:30.261
THANK YOU MISTER MISTER LANE I

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:31.562
YOU WERE YOU DIDN'T BONTA THE

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.998
SPECIFIC CONCERN ABOUT SSI.

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:35.800
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:24:35.867 --> 02:24:39.337
DIRECT DEPOSIT AN AUTOMATIC

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:39.871
CHARGES OUT OF A CHECKING

02:24:39.937 --> 02:24:40.138
ACCOUNT.

02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:44.509
THERE ARE NO CHARGES.

02:24:44.575 --> 02:24:45.610
AN EIGHT DOLLAR FEE?

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:47.412
I'M NOT SURE THERE MAY BE A FEE

02:24:47.478 --> 02:24:50.581
TO MAINTAIN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT

02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:53.151
THAT DOESN'T HAVE DIRECT DEPOSIT.

02:24:53.217 --> 02:24:54.952

WOULD NOT BE RUNNING THE BANK

02:26:01.285 --> 02:26:02.820

SO.

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:32.677

SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:42.486
ACTUALLY AT THE BALLOT.

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:44.555
MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST RAN

02:27:44.622 --> 02:27:45.623
FOR THE SENATE MY OPPONENT HAD

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:46.824
AUTHORED A BILL TO CREATE A

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:49.026
STATE BANK.

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:50.595

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:50.895
[inaudible]

02:27:50.962 --> 02:27:54.165

IN DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT.

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:15.353
AND I'M FOLLOWING ON UNDER

02:28:15.419 --> 02:28:17.922
MORLOCKS OBSERVATIONS.

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:19.223
SHOWS ME THE GOVERNMENT GETS

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:22.059
VERY LITTLE RIGHT.

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.561
WE HAVE SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:25.162
DOLLARS.

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:27.665
ON A TRAIN.

02:28:27.732 --> 02:28:29.900
MULTI BILLION DOLLARS ON ALL THE

02:28:29.967 --> 02:28:32.103
HIGH TECH PROJECTS WE TRIED TO

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:34.405
DEPLOY IN CALIFORNIA.

02:28:34.472 --> 02:28:36.040
NONE OF THEM COME IN ON TIME AND

ALL INCOME IN WAY OVER BUDGET.

02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:42.480
AND IT IT JUST SHOWS ME THAT

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:46.284
THIS WOULD BE A VERY RISKY THING.

02:28:46.350 --> 02:28:46.550
TO TRUST.

02:28:46.617 --> 02:28:48.686

WITH REGULAR BANKS BUT THE

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:58.296
RECORD OF GOVERNMENT DOES NOT

02:28:58.362 --> 02:28:59.930
GIVE ONE COMFORT.

02:28:59.997 --> 02:29:01.065
IN TERMS OF AN AUTHORITY TO
