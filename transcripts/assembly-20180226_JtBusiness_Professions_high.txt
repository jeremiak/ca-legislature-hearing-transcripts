THE FIRST QUESTION ASKED THAT THE BOARD DISCUSSED THE FEASIBILITY COST AND TIME CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO SWITCHING THE CALEB TO COMPUTER BASED TESTING.

THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR CONTINUOUS ADAPTIVE ON DEMAND TESTING AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF PENCIL AND PAPER. EXAMS HELD TWICE A YEAR. HIGH SECURITY AND TESTING STANDARDS WOULD BE MAINTAINED I WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR GREATER ACCESSIBILITY BY OFFERING MULTIPLE TESTING SITES AVAILABLE YEAR ROUND. THE BOARD HAS SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION.

THE BOARD WILL COME AND SEEING THE INPUT FROM THE LICENSE. THIS. THANK THANK YOU THOSE ARE THREE ISSUES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOW WE'VE NOW. COMPLETED THE UP COMMENTS FROM A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BMP COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE. ASSEMBLY BEING P. COMMITTEE NOW OPENING ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MANY MEMBERS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE SO FIRST UP WAS THAT WITH SENATOR PENN ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AND THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER KEITH. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR LOW AND I THINK SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AT A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST OF ALL ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT SEEMS TO BE RUNNING THROUGH IS IS THE. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF STAFFING. ANDERS COMING ABOUT THE. LACK OF DISCIPLINE AND GET YOUR DOCTOR AND NO OTHER YOU KNOW NO. MATTER IS IT. SO I WANNA BE CLEAR AND I CLARIFIED THESE IT SEEMS LIKE IMPLIES THAT YOU TROUBLE HIRING SO YOU HAVE THE POSITION YOU JUST CAN'T HIRE INTO IT OR DO YOU HAVE THE POSITIONS. OURS OR AN ABSENCE OF POSITION ITSELF THAT WAS ENTIRELY CLEAR ANALYSIS TO ME. BUT LET ME CLARIFY DOCTOR FOUND. WE DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY FOR THAT POSITION RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SUBMITTED A B. C. P. THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND IT IS GOING TO BE BEFORE THE SUPPORT COMMITTEE IN APRIL. ADS ON BE SURE FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT IS IN PLACE WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE OR SPECS OF BUDGET COMMITTEES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I SO WANT TO TOUCH ON IS. YOU KNOW BEING A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL MYSELF I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO STAY ON TOP OF THINGS AND. YEAH I AM VERY DISTURBED THAT THAT. THERE BEEN NO KIDDING EDUCATION. TARGETS FOR THREE YEARS AND. SO. AND THEY SAID BEGAN BECAUSE OF VACANCIES WHICH I ACTUALLY I DON'T FIND ACCEPTABLE. YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN A REQUEST SHOULD'VE BEEN MADE I MEAN FOR THREE YEARS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ODD IT'S. AND YOU SAID EXPECTED TO RESUME OUT IT'S A REAL LIFE SUPPORT WRITTEN ARE THOSE AUDITS NOW. I'M GOING NOW. WE HAVE REVISED THE ENTIRE SEA OTTER PROCESS STREAMLINED AND TRAINED STAFF TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW AND WE HAVE SELECTED THE NAMES GOING BACK TO TE TWENTY. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FISCAL YEAR THE BOARD IS ALLOWED. IT REQUIRES LICENSEES TO KEEP THEIR CERTIFICATES FOR FOUR YEARS WERE ABLE TO GO BACK THAT FAR IN THE AUDITING PROCESS AND WE'RE ABLE TO RESUME FROM WHERE WE LEFT OFF. YOUR RESUMING RIGHT NOW CORRECT. OKAY. THE OTHER ISSUE ALSO IN TERMS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION. AS I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE BOARD ALSO APPROVES THE CD PROVIDERS OF COURSE IS CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. SO WHEN THE THINGS THAT. YOU MENTIONED IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S I GUESS THERE'S A FLAT FEE OF A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PROVIDER BUT YOU HAVE SOME PROVIDERS PROVIDING. LOTS OF COURSES AND SOME PROVIDING A FEW. AND I PRESUME. I MEAN AND THEN THE OTHER PART IS COMMENTED ON WAS IS THAT WHILE THERE ARE LEGAL STANDARDS. REGARDS TO. YOU KNOW CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND. WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK I COULD YOU EDUCATION SHOULD NOT BE A SALES JOB. UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WHERE SOMEONE THEY CALL IT CONTINUING EDUCATION IT'S SELLING A PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE PROFITING FROM. SO WE NEED TO BE VERY ON TOP OF THAT. THAT BASICALLY IT'S A COMPLAINT BASED SYSTEM AND WE'RE NOT ACTIVELY PURSUING AND LIKE REQUIRING PEOPLE TO SUBMIT WHAT'S THE COURSE CONTENT IS. WHAT THEIR DECLARATIONS FOR CONFLICT ARE ADVERTISEMENTS RELATE TO THOSE COURSES? SO BEING MUCH MORE PRO ACTIVE ABOUT IT INSTEAD OF PASSIVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY MOST THE PEOPLE WHO GO. THEY SEE SOMETHING. THAT THEY THINK MAYBE SHADY DELL EITHER GO. THERE MAY BE SOME INCENTIVES TO GO EVEN OF PRIDE YOU FREE DINNER OR WILL PAY YOU KNOW YOU GET THERE SOMETHING I MEAN THOSE ARE TYPES OF THINGS. THAT THAT. THEY'LL BE VERY CONCERNING AND THAT'S YOU AND EXPECTS ME TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT IS BEING DONE TO TRY TO TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ANSWER SIMPLY WAITING FOR COMPLAINTS AND THEN SECOND OF ALL. YOU KNOW AGAIN. NOW IF YOU ARE AUDITING AND FOR THREE YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF STAFF ONLY TO DO IT AND THEN THE OTHER THINGS ARE YOU CONSIDERING PERHAPS A PER COURSE FEE AND AS WELL AS A PROVIDER FEE TO ENSURE YOU HAVE TO. THE REVENUE NECESSARY AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE RUNNING AT THAT DEFICIT EVEN THOUGH YOU DO HAVE A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES. TO BE SURE THAT YOU CAN SUPPORT THE THE ENFORCEMENT THAT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. I'LL START AT THE FIRST QUESTION OF THE BOARD'S REGULATIONS DO REQUIRE THAT SEE PROVIDERS WHEN SUBMITTING A COURSE APPROVAL A REQUEST DO. NOT SUBMIT THERE AT ADVERTISEMENTS AND WE DO REVIEW THE ADVERTISEMENTS THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO IF THEY HAVE A PRODUCT OF THEIR OWN. THE REQUIRED TO TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL GENERIC PRODUCT AS WELL. SO THERE. THEY'RE MADE TO DECLARE IF THAT IS THE CASE IN THE APPLICATION. THESE ARE REVIEWED IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS. OF THE BOARD HAS DISCUSSED AND. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED IN EVEN IN THE LAST BACKGROUND PAPER THAT THE BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET A PER COURSE FEE AND STAFF IS RESEARCHING THIS FOR A COST ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS. SO IN TERMS OF BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT SO YOU HAVE STEEP CURRENT HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFF TO DO THAT YET OR NOT. BUT NOT FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONITORING THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT. WHAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER IS WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO WHAT WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL AS FOR ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF BEING ABLE TO SIT AND ON LIFE COURSES EITHER BY? CONTRACTING WITH SMES SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OR BY BEING ABLE TO SIT IN ON THE LIVE WEBINARS THERE ARE VIEWED. BY OUR LICENSEES SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE LOOKING AT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER STUFF TO DO THAT. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT I'M SURE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES. IT'S IT'S USUALLY YOU KNOW THAT TRYING TO BE SURE WE. DRESS THE BAD ACTORS ENDED ABOUT THERE BECAUSE WE WE DON'T WANT TO. HAVING. COURSES THAT ARE NOT THAT MAY BE IN CONFLICT ARE. PROVIDE MISINFORMATION TO PROVIDERS NOW. THEIR PERSONAL GAIN. THANK YOU. AND THE MEMBERSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING YOU FOR. YOUR PRESENTATION AND I. I AM HERE IN PART AS. SOMEONE HIS FATHER'S AN ACUPUNCTURIST AND SOME OF HIS BROTHER'S AN ACUPUNCTURIST SO I HAVE. CERTAINLY BEEN APPRISED OF FROM THEM AND OTHERS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE GRAPPLING WITH. ONE OF THE ISSUES I CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE IS JUST THE CHALLENGES OF OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN BEING ABLE TO ACCESS. THE TYPE OF CARE THAT YOUR PROFESSION IS PROVIDING A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND NUMBER OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE. WORKING WITH OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FUNNY TO THE MEDICAL PROCESS. THAT HAD BEEN CUT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. BUT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR PARTICULARLY FROM A LOW INCOME. RESIDENCE. PARTICULAR FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF CHALLENGES OF RECEIVING CARE. FROM YOUR PROFESSION AND IT OCCURRED TO ME AS I READ THE OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES AROUND. CHALLENGES IN BALANCING THE BUDGET THE FAILURE OF OR OR THE. THE FACT THAT. THAT THAT THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD IS NOT YET ON% THE PRE SYSTEM OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND SCHOOL PREFOLDS. THE CHALLENGES AS DOCTOR PAN POINTED OUT AROUND THE LACK ABOUT ITS AROUND CONTINUED EDUCATION ALL OF THESE COULD IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OF MAKING SURE THAT. WE HAVE A PROFESSION THAT IS IS READY TO PROVIDE THE ACCESS THAT WE NEED FOR FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SOMEONE IF YOU COULD ADDRESS WHAT YOU SEE AS CHALLENGES AND. AND WHAT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING AS AS OVERSIGHT TO ASSIST THE PROFESSION OF MOVING IN THAT RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU MR TO. OF. THE PART I WANT TO SEE I AGREE WITH THE CURRENTLY YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THE BOARD REALLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. OF THE YEAR INSURANCE PART YOU KNOW FULL OF THE PATIENTS THAT THERE'S MANY OF THEM. IT IS THE UNDERSERVED. I KNOW A LOT OF THE ACCU PUNCTURES TODAY YOU KNOW SCREWS THE. WORKING. TO SERVE THOSE PART OF THE POPULATIONS AS YOU KNOW. EDUCATION AND FREE EVEN TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL IS TOO DIFFERENT TO SERVICES. A WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL OF FROM YOU KNOW THE. LEGISLATURE TO HELP CONTINUE. WORKING ON HOW TO. HELP TOO FUNDING. BE PAID IN THE FUTURE. OF FROM ONE OF THE PARTY WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORKING I'LL. HELP WITH THE CONTINUE EDUCATION COURSES. HELP TO. PROTECT OTHER CONSUMERS IN A WAY IS. LICENSING REGULATION MANDATE OF ACUPUNCTURE ACT. I MAY I THINK. IF I MAY ADD OF THE ACT PERFECT ACUPUNCTURE PROFESSION NATIONALLY. HAS DIFFERENT STANDARDS AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER OUR VIEW THAT DOES MAKE IT CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF A NATIONAL LEVEL OF DELIVERY BUT AS YOU SAID CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE THAT IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. Z.. ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES INTERNALLY WITH THE BOARD IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE FOCUSED ON STREAMLINING OUR PROCESSES SO THAT OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES DO NOT HOLD UP THE. PUBLIC'S PROTECTION IN ACUPUNCTURE AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO ENDEAVOR TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSINESS PLAN OR IS IT BUSINESS MOTIVATION PLAN RIGHT NOW. WE ARE RELEASED THREE CANDIDATE ON THE BREEZE SYSTEM AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN PAYING INTO IT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS IT ACTUALLY IS BEEN HELPFUL TO HOLD OFF UNTIL RELEASED THREE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE CHALLENGES FOR RELEASES ONE AND TWO IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. OF MORE OVER THE. COMMITTEES HAVE DIRECTED THE DC EIGHT TO DO THIS BUSINESS MORE EFFICIENT PLAN WHICH IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES RIGHT NOW. WE ARE CURRENTLY MAPPING ARE AS IS PROCESS ISN'T GOING TO BE MOVING TOWARD TWO B. PROCESSES SEEKING IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW SYSTEMS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO THIS IS I THINK VERY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE. THE PROPER BUSINESS TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC SO THAT NOTHING THAT HAPPENS INTERNALLY IS HOLDING UP. THE PRACTICE OF ACUPUNCTURE IN A SAFE SETTING IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST. IN I THINK THE ISSUES ARE A BREEZE OR BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED AND. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER EIGHT AS DCA KNOWS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO. HELP IN A NUMBER OF OUR PROFESSION SUCK IT UP ONLINE. I KNOW PART OF THE ANALYSIS. YOUR BOARD IS VOTED TO RECOMMEND INTRODUCING INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO TAKE. ONE TYPE OF AN EXAMINATION AND. AGAIN I THINK THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE TOOLS TO THE VET. THE QUALIFICATION OF OF OF FOR ACUPUNCTURISTS. I THINK MY FINAL COMMENT IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ACUPUNCTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MANY INSTANCES A LOWER COST. WAY OF PROVIDING. POT IS THE TYPE OF HEALTH CARE THAT. COULD OTHERWISE BE EXPENSIVE IF PROVIDED THROUGH OTHER MEANS. BUT I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING WITH REGARDS TO THE PROFESSION ARE HOLDING US BACK FROM REALLY SEEN THAT VISION AND SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION OF HOW WE ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES IN THE OVERVIEW SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALITY. AS A MEMBER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. THUS FAR. I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INDUSTRY. I FOR ONE HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE AGRICULTURE. BEFORE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF NEEDLES SO DOES AS FREAKS ME OUT TO BE HONEST HOWEVER NOT SO BAD. HOWEVER. THE BORDERS ISSUED. A CERTAIN PARTICULAR. DIRECTIVES AS RELATES TO AMEND FOR CEMENT AND IN THIS SPACE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE AVERAGE DAYS OF AN AVERAGE DAY. UP TO PROCESS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE LICENSES HAS INCREASED FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE. UP IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. TO NINE HUNDRED AND TWO TWO AND THE EFFORTS TWENTY OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN. AND ALSO THE AVERAGE. DAY. TAKES A LONG TIME TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION FROM. ANYWHERE FROM A THOUSAND EIGHTY TWO. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. AND THE LIST GOES ON SO I NEED YOU TO TELL ME BECAUSE CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW WINTERS THERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PATIENTS IN. AT ARE PROTECTED. WHAT DOES IT TAKE SO LONG? FOR THESE OCCURRENCES TAKE PLACE FOR ONE. AND DO LICENSEES WHO. UNDER BEST OCCASION CONTINUE TO PRACTICE WHILE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON. ARMS WON'T YOU ANSWER THOSE TWO FOR ME AND THAT I HAVE ONE FINAL. CERTAINLY. THE FIRST QUESTION. BACKBONE TO BOARD RELATIVE TO OTHER BOARDS HAS FEWER COMPLAINTS IMPURE INVESTIGATIONS AND A NUMBER OF THE. ISSUES THAT. INCREASES THE TIME FRAME IS THAT THEY'RE VERY COMPLEX. SITUATIONS ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT REQUIRES A DELICATE INVESTIGATION OR A LONG TIME WITH THE US. DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TO REVIEW. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND WE DON'T WANT TO. CUT CORNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY ENACTED. ADDITIONALLY IF THERE'S A CRIMINAL. SITUATION OR ENFORCEMENT REASON THE BOARD DOES SEEK PC TWENTY THREES WHICH IS PENAL CODE TWENTY THREE WHICH. A IN CRIMINAL JUDGE CAN REVIEW AND IF THE COLONEL JUDGE AGREES WILL SUSPEND THE LICENSE AND THE BOARD CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE STATEMENT OF ISSUES. TO BE ABLE TO DO A SIMILAR SITUATION. BOARD ADDITIONALLY POSTS ALL ACCUSATIONS TO THEIR WEBSITE. THE TIME FRAME IS A CONCERN FOR THE BOARD. AND WE ARE WORKING TO REDUCE THOSE DATES ARE THE DAYS THAT TAKES TO COMPLETE THOSE PROCESSES AND WE HAVE BEEN REDUCING OUR NUMBERS ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR ENFORCEMENT. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ON A NUMBER OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. SO DID SO. WHAT INVESTIGATION IS CONTINUING THE PERSON STILL THE LICENSEE IS STILL CONTINUE TO PRACTICE ONE DESIGNATION IS CONTINUING? WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT OR THE ENFORCEMENT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE. OKAY. IF FOR EXAMPLE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT GOES STRAIGHT TO CRIMINALS. TUITION AND THEREFORE WE WOULD ISSUE OF PC TWENTY THREE RIGHT AWAY. IF IT'S SOMETHING I SINCE I'M SORRY TO THE LICENSEE WILL BE REMOVED WHEN NOT BE ABLE TO. PRACTICE UNTIL THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE COMPLETED THANK YOU. IN ADDITION SOME. WE DO SEEK STIPULATED SURRENDERS TO HELP REDUCE OUR TIME FRAMES AND GET THAT LICENSE OFF THE. ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL. AND FOR ISSUES SUCH AS FORGETTING TO UPDATE YOUR ADDRESS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. WHICH IS A REGULATORY REQUIREMENT OF LICENSEES WE DO NOT. PUSH FOR. SUSPENDED THAT'S A SIMPLE CITATION SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS POSSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT THE INCREDIBLY EGREGIOUS OR CRIMINAL WE DO. SEEK TO REMOVE THAT LICENSE FROM PRACTICE. IS PART OF THAT. TERMS OF DISCIPLINE IS ITS SUSPENSION IS SUSPENSION AN ALTERNATIVE THAT'S PART OF THE PC TWENTY THREE YES. YES WE DO SPEND LICENSES FOR THAT. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR NOW. GIVE VERY MUCH AS AMERICANS IN ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS AN ADVANCE. IS JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP AND I APPRECIATE THE SUMMER GIBSON'S QUESTION. BECAUSE WE SAY THINGS LIKE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. TO NINE HUNDRED TWO LET'S JUST PUT THAT IS ONE AND A HALF YEARS TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS BUT YOU KNOW WE SEE DAYS PEOPLE START GAME LOSS AT HOW MANY HUNDRED DAYS. IT'S ONE AND A HALF YEARS TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHICH MEANS THAT THIS REPORT INTO FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. TWO AND A HALF YEARS MEANS THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS ACCUSED AT THE TIME THIS NUMBER CAME OUT MAY STILL. THE PROCESSING. AND THEN THE AVERAGE IS COMPLETE DISPLAY AT INVESTIGATIONS. WE SAY A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED AND. ELEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY TWO YOU'RE TALKING TWO POINT NINE SEVEN YEARS TO OVER THREE YEARS. AND IT WORKED OUT SO I I ENDED BECAUSE WE SAY NUMBER OF DAYS I MEAN SOMEBODY JUST GET LOST AT HOW MANY HUNDRED DAYS LET'S JUST BE VERY CLEAR. OVER THREE YEARS DID SO WERE WE DOING TO SHRINK THAT I MEAN IS ACCEPTABLE TO BE THREE YEARS. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FROM A PUBLIC PERSON TRACTION STANDPOINT. AND THAT THE AVERAGE THAT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THEM ARE LONGER EXACTLY RIGHT AND A NUMBER OF OUR SMALLER AGAIN THESE ARE LOWER NUMBER OF CASES ARE AVERAGE DOES GET AFFECTED BY THAT BUT IT IS OUR AVERAGE. AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE THOSE TIME AS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND WITH A DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE THAT TIME WHAT'S WHAT'S THE GOAL HOW LONG SHOULD BE. AS LOW AS POSSIBLE I BELIEVE OUR TARGETS MODERN FORTY DAYS. BUT SAID I BELIEVE THE TARGET DATE IS FIVE IRON FORTY DAYS FROM START RECEIVING COMPLAINTS TO. YEARS IS THAT THAT WOULD BE JUST OVER. ONE AND A HALF YES OKAY SO DOES THAT STILL A YEAR AND A HALF AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY MUCH BUT ME MUCH GREATER IMPROVEMENT AND THE NUMBERS WE HAVE HERE CERTAINLY AND. IF I MAY BRING ATTENTION THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS OCCASION THAT HAS TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND HEARINGS. AS WELL SO THAT DOES TACK ON MORE TIME BUT IT IS A COMPLETE AND OPEN PROCESS IS THERE A WAY TO GET A. BREAK DOWN TO REALIZE THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SO SOMEONE TAKE LONGER AND OTHERS AS A WAY TO DO MORE OF A BREAK DOWN LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE THAT WHICH TYPES BECAUSE CERTAINLY. I MEAN THERE'S CERTAIN CERTAIN ONES IN YOUR PRIOR PRIORITIZING CERTAIN ONES I MEAN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THESE AVERAGES IS THERE A WAY TO SAY OKAY YOU KNOW SOME ARE MINOR AND DEBT AND BUT THAT MAJOR ONES ETCETERA AND I SEE SOME TO REQUIRE MORE INVESTIGATION WE HAVE TO. DO PROCESSO I'M REALIZE THERE'S A TIME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TOO. THAT THING THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO. HAVE A BETTER REFLECTION OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING WHAT THE REASONABLE GOALS ARE. ETCETERA. BECAUSE JUST HAVING THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S PRETTY ONE SO BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE AND NEEDS TO CONSIDER ONE DESTINATION IT TAKES TIME. BUT. WE WILL LOOK INTO ADDITIONAL REPORTING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE COMMITTEES UPON INDIVIDUAL A DISCIPLINARY CASES. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE CONSULTANTS TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF QUESTIONS EVENLY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR THE CONVERSATIONS AND FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT I THINK YOU'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO KIND OF BRING THINGS. CLOSER TO WHAT I THINK WE. WOULD FEEL WOULD BE. ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS AND AND. EXCELLENT STANDARDS WITH WHICH I THINK YOU YOU WANT TO PERFORM THE. THE BOARD WITH THE ONE QUESTION THAT CAME TO MIND OVER ISSUE TWELVE AND THIS IS THE ONE WHERE. IF YOU RECALL DEALS WITH THE. SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED BY NON ACUPUNCTURISTS. BY OTHER PROFESSIONS. AND. IT SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF THEIR TRAINING FOR THAT THEY HAVE THE TRAINING AND COMPETENCY TO DO THAT HAVE YOU REACHED OUT TO SOME OF THE BOARDS. OF THOSE PARTICULAR PROFESSIONS TO SEE IF. REALLY FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR COMPETENCY AND AND THE TRAINING TO SEE WHAT TO WHAT CAN BE DONE. IS THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING SOME OF THE SAME TECHNIQUES SIMILAR TO DRY NEEDLING IS ONE AND NO. INDEED AND WITH DRY NEEDLING WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE PHYSICAL THERAPY BOARD AND CREATED CONTACTS AND STREAMLINE THE REFERRAL PROCESS FOR. INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING WITH AN ACUPUNCTURE LICENSE AND SO WE DO REFER THEM TO THE PHYSICAL THERAPY BOARD FOR PRACTICING OUTSIDE OF THEIR SCOPE IF THE PHYSICAL THERAPY BOARD GOES THAT ROUTE. AND THEN WE CAN ALSO COME BACK AN ISSUE A CITATION AFTER THE BOARD THAT BOARD TAKES AN ACTION ON THEIR LICENSEE. ADDITIONAL WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO BE OUR BUREAU ON.

I HAVE THREE ISSUES AND AND AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S VERY CRUCIAL TO US WHEN WE. THE CALIFORNIA I COULD POST A PUNCTURE ASSOCIATION IS VERY STRONGLY WORKING TOWARD UNIFICATION OF THE STRAIGHT ORGANIZATION WHEN YOU FOCUS. TOO MUCH ON UNIFICATION YOU CREATE COMPROMISE WHEN YOU COME WHEN YOU FOCUS TOO MUCH ON DIVERSITY. YOU CREATE DIVISIONS. WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS CONNECTEDNESS? THIS NCCA WANTED AN EXAM IS I BELIEVE IMPORTANT FOR US TO TO REACH OUT AND ADOPT AS A NATION WIDE STANDARD WE NEED. OUR NEW ACUPUNCTURISTS ARE NEW. FOLKS COMING AND THAT COMPORTS THEIR LICENSE TO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES. ON THE ISSUE OF CONNECTEDNESS. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AN APPARENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

WE FIND THIS CONCERNING AND THE USE OF. CURRENTS OF LEGAL ISSUES AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND WE WOULD LIKE THAT TO BE LOOKED AT. OUR MAIN THING RIGHT NOW IS UNIFICATION WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND TO COMING TOGETHER. IS GONNA RE REQUIRE US ALL TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT THINGS WERE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF RINGING OUR ACUPUNCTURE TOGETHER SO THAT OUR LEGISLATORS. CAN HAVE ONE VOICE AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR STATE AND FOR OUR PATIENTS THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S YOUNG KIM I'M REPRESENTING KOREAN OKAY I COULD CONTROL PHYSICIAN.

BECAUSE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID TO US. TO EXPRESS OUR ASSOCIATIONS THE VOICE SOUL HUIZENGA. BEFORE WE TALKING ABOUT TO DIAL ONE EXAM THE ISSUE WE SHOULD TAKE WE SHOULD LOOK THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT. THE GOAL OF WHAT THE PROFESSION WANT TO GO WHAT'S THE LEVEL CALIFORNIA THANK YOU PUNCH A PROFESSION SHOULD THE BEAT. OF EITHER HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA AND YOU PUNCH A PROFESSION IS LEADING THE COUNTRY SOUL. WON THE KIND THE EXAM CAN. MEET THESE OF SIN THAT SO THAT'S A QUESTION FOR. ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT. AND THE SECOND THAT. I KNOW THE ACUPUNCTURE. IS MORE POPULAR THAN FORTY YEARS AGO. IN TUCSON THE STREET A YOU NEED TO. SEND THE BILL FOR ACUPUNCTURE THE EDUCATION TO BE FALSE ON THE HOUR A DOCTORAL LEVEL ENGINES. ANALYZES SOUL. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY YEARS LATER WHERE ARE WE I'M SO NOW THE JOINT COMMISSION. ACCREDITS. ALL THE HOSPITAL ABOUT FOR THE HOSPITAL ZERO CRY THAT. ALL THE PAIN TREATMENT HAS ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INCLUDE ACUPUNCTURE SO CAN ARE WE READY TO GO TO HOSPITAL TO GO TO THE MAINSTREAM AND MENACING. THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS MULTI PART AND THEN THE EXAM THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME'S TOM KILL I'M A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST. I AM CHIEF RESIDENT OF TCM AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL IN OAKLAND. AND I AM ON THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS VICE CHAIR FOR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CHINESE MEDICINE. THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CHINESE MEDICINE SUPPORTS THE CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTURE BOARD. AND BELIEVES THAT VITAL TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF CONSUMERS AND THE OCCUPANT YOUR PROFESSION. CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURISTS PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS FROM INCOMPETENT IN FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS YOUR PRACTICE. FOR LICENSING AND READ REGULATION OF ACUPUNCTURISTS. BY ENFORCING THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPANT YOUR LICENSE OR ACT. CALIFORNIA COULD PUNCH YOUR COMMUNITY IS THE SIZE OF ALL THE OTHER STATES PUT TOGETHER. IN REGARDS TO THE LICENSING EXAM. THE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATION SERVICES OPUS. REVIEWED BOTH THE KALE AND THE NCC A WARM EXAMS. FOUND THAT THE BOTH EXAMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY COMPATIBLE AND THEIR ABILITY TO TEST ENTRY LEVEL ACUPUNCTURISTS. OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC LAWS REGULATIONS. THE OPUS REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA THE KALE STATED AND I QUOTE. THE TEST COVERS THE GENERAL AREAS OF OCCUPANTS YOUR PRACTICE. RELEVANT TO ENTRY LEVEL LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA OCCUPANT YOUR PRACTICE. RELATED TO CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC LAWS RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE NC SALE M. EXAM DOES NOT. IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD FUNCTIONING TESTING THE KILL. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT REPLACING THE KALE WITH THE NC SALEM WILL FURTHER THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARDS DUTY. OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM INCOMPETENT DOCUMENTS OR PRACTICE. THEREFORE. WE RECOMMEND THE CONTINUANCE OF THE KILL EXAM. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD RAMP UP ITS EFFORTS. TO MAKE THE KILL MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR COMPUTER BASED ELECTRONIC TESTING. THIS UPGRADE TO RESULT IN COST SAVINGS AND BE MUTUALLY CONVENIENT FOR BOTH THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND ITS CANDIDATES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY SOME SIXTEEN STATES THAT OFFER RECIPROCITY FOR CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURISTS. SINCE THE OPUS REPORT SHOWS THAT THE KALE IN THE NCC A WHIM EXAM ARE FUNDAMENTALLY COMPATIBLE. WE URGE THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPANTS ABOARD TO WORK WITH OTHER STATES NATIONALLY. TO MAKE RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS FOR PORTABILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPANT YOUR LICENSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RAW ADCOCK I'M A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST I PRACTICE IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY FOR UCSF. I DO RESEARCH AND CLINICAL WORK THERE I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ORIENTAL MEDICAL FOR FASHION. OUR PROFESSION IS AMAZING LOOK AT THE DIVERSITY IN THIS ROOM IT DOES REPRESENT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND ALSO THE GREAT GIFT THAT WE HAVE IN THE PROFESSION OF ACUPUNCTURE. IT PRESENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR US AND HOW WE WORK WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGES MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES AND INTEGRATE THAT INTO A VERY COMPLICATED BY A MEDICAL SYSTEM. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE EXAMS THAT'S THE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US TO WORK OUT BUT I ALSO NOTICE A FEW THINGS THAT I THINK OUR PROFESSION FACES. NUMBER ONE HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO DELIVER LOW COST AFFORDABLE CARE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE AN ANSWER TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH HAS. STATED THAT ACUPUNCTURE IS A SOLUTION TO OPIATE ADDICTION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. OUR PROFESSION IS GOING TO GROW QUICKLY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS HOW WE GROW IS THE QUESTION OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TOGETHER. SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE FACE I THINK AS A PROFESSION AND I WANT TO PUT THIS IN FROM THE COMMITTEE IS NUMBER ONE INSURANCE PAYOUTS WE TOUCHED ON THIS. MEDIC HELP PAY OUTS I'M SO GLAD TO SEE THOSE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE HAPPENING AGAIN. AND YET AT THE THE AMOUNT IS NOT PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE FOR OUR PRACTITIONERS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOWARDS ALSO INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE NOT PAYING OUT OUR MEMBERS AT THE RIGHT PRICE PLACE. AND ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED IN THIS ROOM ARE WORKING TOWARDS CHANGING THAT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT. SO INSURANCE IS A HUGE ISSUE NUMBER TWO ON THE OTHER ISSUE IS OUR OTHER PRACTITIONERS USURPING OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND I WANT TO WIN THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE HITS IT FADED. AND NOT ONLY DOES OUR ASSOCIATION SUPPORT AND NEED THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD TO HELP GUIDE THE GROWTH OF OUR PROFESSION. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD TO BE EMPOWERED TO PROTECT OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE AS WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER STATES PEOPLE WITH LIMITED TRAINING PRACTICING OUR SCOPE AND ENDANGERING CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND ALSO REDUCING THE ADVOCACY IN THE STRENGTH AND THE POWER OF WHAT OUR MEDICINE CAN BRING. THANK YOU. I AM TEH ROBIE AND I'M A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST AND ALSO AN INTERN AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL. AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY. ARM AT HIGHLAND IT'S BEEN A REALLY GREAT THING TO SEE THAT THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN WESTERN AND AND. MORE ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES IS BEING. STRENGTHENED AND WERE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. I WAS TOLD THAT WHEN THE. RESIDENCY FIRST STARTED THAT HE ARE DOCTORS WERE SORT OF LIKE WHY ARE YOU HERE ANOTHER LIKE A GREAT YOU'RE HERE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THE RESULTS. I PERSONALLY HAVE SEEN ACUPUNCTURE HELP OF. PEOPLE WITH THE HOST HER HEEL PAIN. PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE. MIGRAINES WHO ARE HELPED AND I'M TALKING ABOUT GOING FROM LIKE A TEN OUT OF TEN AND PAIN TO DOWN TO A TWO OR THREE. AND PAIN AFTER THE TREATMENT AND THAT'S AFTER THE MEDICATION HAS NOT HELPED. WE ARE IN A POSITION TO HELP WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. AND. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT NO MORE ELSE. THEN HIGHLAND HAVE I HEARD MORE ABOUT CONNECTEDNESS AND UNITY. ON THAT IS A CONCERN FOR US. PERSONALLY I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO. SEE MYSELF BE ABLE TO TRAVEL ANY TO ANY STATE AND PRACTICE HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO GET THERE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES WHO HAVE LESS TRAINING. AND LESS OF A STRICT STANDARDS TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE. AND PRACTICE IN THE SAME WAY IT THREATENS. OUR STATUS THAT WE WORKED VERY HARD TO GAIN THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S HEIDI BARTLETT I'M A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST I ALSO AND IT IN TURN CURRENTLY AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE ACUPUNCTURE OFFERED THERE I WAS A CANCER PATIENT. AND RECEIVED WEEKLY TREATMENTS. ALONG WITH MY CHEMOTHERAPY AND IT. MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN MY HOUSE. SO I THINK BEING ABLE WE TALKED ABOUT WE HEARD ABOUT OFFERING TREATMENT SO LOW INCOME PEOPLE OUR INTERNS AT THE HOSPITAL ARE DOING THAT AND SEEING A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. THE DIFFICULTY IS IS THAT WE ARE PAYING OURSELVES PERSONALLY TO OFFER THAT SERVICE AND IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUS LIKE THE OTHER RESIDENTS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS AT THE HOSPITAL ARE BEING PAID TO. TO HELP PEOPLE BE GREAT IF WE COULD EXPAND WHAT WE OFFER TO THESE PATIENTS AND MAKE THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M I'M VERY ENCOURAGED WHEN WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE LICENSING EXAM I THINK. TAKING BOTH EXAMS THE CALIFORNIA LICENSING IS DOWN FOR ME BUT WAS MORE CHALLENGING I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL NATIONALLY AND PRACTICE. ON BUT I AGREE THAT THE CALIFORNIA LICENSING DOWN IS MUCH HIGHER STANDARD THAN THAN THE NATIONAL EXAM HAVING TAKEN BOTH FAIRLY RECENTLY. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS RUN A MODEL LESSONS OF THE OCCUPYING NESS. PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CHINESE MEDICINE POPE THE MEMBER OF A HIGH LEVEL. ED TRAINING PROGRAM ALSO I'M PROPERTIES THE SUCKER. HOUSE SEES THEM. TODAY EVERYBODY SIT HERE AND WE WERE SO THE PULL TO THE CONSUMERS OF FIRST. SO THAT THE USER COMPARED TO THE CHINESE MEDICINE A COUPON TENNIS BUT IS THE ONLY DON'T HAVE FOR THE. THE TRAIN YOU SELECT THE NURSE IS PHYSICAL THERAPY IS. THAT WESTERN MEDICINE THEY BOTH HAVE THE. THE HOSPITAL TRAINING AND THE STAR FROM THIS YEAR. STARTING COMING TO ALLOW THE BOSS DOESN'T HOSPITAL HAVE LOOKED BACK UNDER THE COUNTRY THE PATIENT THAT I THINK THAT YOU KIND OF FIND OUT THE CURRENT LAWS LEAKING ALL OF THESE PART. I HOPE THE COMEDY THING COP ON THE THE TRAINEE HARD TO LEAD ME TO THE HOSPITAL SPENDERS. ISA PARTED THAT WE HAVE WITH THE WHAT EXAMINATION IN THE AMERICA. THAT WE CANNOT FOR PROTECT ALL THE CONSUMERS WITH BAD THE PATIENT THAT WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR. BUS SPENDER IS IT BECAUSE I'M BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA STANDARD THAT MADE A NATIONAL THE YOU KNOW. EXAMINATION ALSO VSX YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT SOMEBODY HAVE A LOT TO HELP US. UNITED AND HAVE ONE POLL WERE WHEN WHAT IS AFFECT YOU SO MUCH. HEY GOOD MORNING I'M WAY WAY AM FROM AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CHINESE MEDICINE AND ACUPUNCTURE. AND I LIKE TO SAY I. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SUPPORT OUR. ACUPUNCTURE BOOK BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB TO REACH OUT TO OTHER. COMMITTEES ABOUT THE. I'M PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE OF ACUPUNCTURE THAT'S A VERY CRUCIAL TO OUR PROFESSION AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE SOME PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE THE QUALITY AND THE. PRACTICE OF OUR. NEEDLING PART THE THE ACUPUNCTURE WHOEVER LIKE PUNCTURED THROUGH THE SKIN USE AND USING A NEEDLE THATS ACUPUNCTURE. AND IF THEY NAME IT EITHER WHY SELECT DRY NEEDLING ALL LEVER. THAT'S JUST TRYING TO TRICK THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS AND SO I HUNDRED PERCENT SUPPORT THE ACUPUNCTURE FOR IS IT DOING THAT AND. I KEEP ON TRIPLE IS TRYING TO REINFORCE THE AUDITING OFF THE CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TOO. AND I THINK THE ACUPUNCTURE FOR IS A VERY BUSY LIKE DOING ALL THESE JAPS ALREADY AND THEY HAVE TO EVERY TWO YEARS YOU WRITE OUT A BIG REPORT ABOUT THE SUNSET REVIEW THAT'S. TOO MUCH WORK SO I REALLY HOPE THIS. YOU PUNCH A BOARD CAN BE LIKE SUN RISE OF FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS NEXT TURN. AND DANDY EITHER ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING OUT IS THAT. I KNOW OF MANY A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS THEY HAVE MORE PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS THAN THE PUBLIC MEMBER LIKE A CHIROPRACTOR'S ALL PHYSICAL THERAPY. THEY ALL HAVE MORE OF A PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS AND I HOPE OUR BOARD HAS MORE PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS BECAUSE IT THAT'S BETTER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. US SO DANCE OF THE. WITH THE PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS WILL UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THIS PROFESSION CAN DO. THE BEST TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC AND WHAT'S THE SAFE IT'S SAFEST WAY TOO SO I SUPPORT THE. MORE. PROFESSIONAL MEMBER IN THE BOAT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY MY NAME IS JEAN GENOCIDES YES THAT ONE ACUPUNCTURISTS THEM PRACTICE. A JUST A LOCAL. SO FIRST I WAS THANKFUL OCCUPYING TO BOLT. AND. AS AS THAT OF ALL OF OUR ACUPUNCTURIST SO SHOWING THOSE. ALL THE WAY MAYA. OUR OPINIONS. SO FOR THE. THE. LICENSE UP TESTS. FROM THINGS C. C. O. M.. I STILL THINK. I'M I THINK UP. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY. WHAT'S GOOD FOR OUR. STATE OR THE. ACUPUNCTURISTS AND CONSUMERS. SO THE QUALITY IS VERY IMPORTANT. THEN. IF THE QUALITY IS GOOD AND WE CAN BE STRONGER THAN. OTHER STATE. SO KILL IS BETTER THAN. AN A CC A LAMB SO YOU'VE KILLED CAN TAKEOVER ALL OF YOU SEE THE O. M. THAT'S BEST THE SUGGESTION. I THINK. IF. WELL WE CAN'T MAKE THE KILL MORE HIGHER STANDARD. AND TWO STATE OF THE. TO. TO TAKE OVER ANKLE WAS CEO M. THAT'S. THAT'S THE MY A SUGGESTION. AND THEN. I ALSO THINK. WHY THE DO I NEED ALSO OF? ATTACKED AT. THE THEY CAN PRACTICE IT OTHER STATES. IS BECAUSE THEY'RE STATE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH. BUT. OUR SELF LIKE CALIFORNIA OR THE. ASSOCIATION. WE NEED MORE STRONGER. I AM I'M VERY STRONG TO SUPPORT. TO SUGGEST WE CAN UNIFY AS A BIG THE. ASSOCIATION CAN BE STRONGER THAN STRONGER. THEN THIS SUGGESTION IS ALSO. IT IS THE ONLY. OCCUPYING TWO BOARD. THEN YOU CAN UNIFY OUR. I GOT ONE. ASSOCIATION THAT'S WOULD BE STRONGER THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS STANLEY AND I'M A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO MOVE SOON AND LET'S TAKE THE NCCA WHEN EXAM SO I CAN CONTINUE PRACTICING MEDICINE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE STANDARDS OF EDUCATION ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE FEEL OF ACUPUNCTURE. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT KAHLER THE NCCA O. M. EXAMS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE I BELIEVE BOTH OF THEM I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HAVE A NATIONAL STANDARD AND WE CAN HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF EDUCATION. MY SECOND POINT IS THAT I BELIEVE THAT CHINESE MEDICINE HAS THE ABILITY WE HAVE THE RESEARCH WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND WE HAVE THE TRAINING TO TREAT AND HELP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THIS COUNTRY. AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THERE'S A HUGE SCOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE TO PATIENTS ACROSS UNITED STATES.

IN THE FUTURE FUTURE FUTURES THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE MORNING MY NAME IS MARILYN ALAN I TEACH LAW AND ETHICS AND. REGULATIONS AT SEVENTEEN ACUPUNCTURE SCHOOLS. I ALSO SERVED AS THE DELEGATE FROM THE UNITED STATES. TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. AND AS OF JUNE TWENTY FIFTH. AND TWENTY SIX THIS YEAR THEY WILL RELEASE THE DYE THE DIAGNOSTIC CODES. FOR ACUPUNCTURE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE WILL HAVE A SET OF DIAGNOSTIC CODES FOR THIS MEDICINE. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SET OF WESTERN DIAGNOSTIC CODES ICD LEVIN. IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE GOING TO START THE FIELD TRIALS ON THAT. I MET WITH THE CDC WHICH IS GOING TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THEY'RE GOING TO COLLECT THE DATA. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HELP US TO PUT THAT DATA TOGETHER SO IT CAN BE USED. TO SUPPORT THESE DIAGNOSTIC CODE THROUGH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN GENEVA. WHEN I MET WITH THE DELEGATE FROM THE CDC WHOSE NAME IS DONNA PICKETT. I MET WITH HER ALONG WITH W. H. O. DELEGATE IN NON. IN MEXICO CITY THIS YEAR. IN OCTOBER AND THE FIRST QUESTION SHE ASKED ME WAS. IS THERE SOME TYPE. OF NATIONAL DIPLOMA CERTIFICATE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT ACUPUNCTURISTS ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED. I KNOW THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE TEST SHOULD BE THE KILLED SHOULD BE NCCA A WHIM. NCCU IMAGE USED IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER STATE AROUND THE UNITED STATES FOR THE WAY OF LICENSURE. DONNA SAID TO ME THERE'S TWO REASONS THE CDC WILL SUPPORT YOU. NUMBER ONE I KNOW YOU AND TRUST YOU SO I'M WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE. ON ACUPUNCTURE AND NUMBER TWO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THEIR NATIONAL CERTIFIED. WE ALL KNOW THAT ACUPUNCTURISTS ARE LICENSED. NATIONAL CERTIFICATION IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP. I ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ACUPUNCTURE IS THE FASTEST GROWING MEDICINE. IN THE WORLD TODAY. BASED ON A SURVEY THAT WAS DONE THROUGH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WITH THEIR HUNDRED NINETY SIX MEMBER NATIONS. THEY SENT THE SURVEY OUT IT TOOK THEM A YEAR TO PULL ALL THE INFORMATION TOGETHER. BUT THEY FOUND OUT THAT EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. USES SOME FORM OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. OF THIS MY NAME IS VICTORIA TO ONE. A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST. I'M ALSO CHAIR WORD THE. GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CHINESE MEDICINE. I CURRENTLY WORK IN. IN CUPERTINO SOUTHERN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S SOUTH OF IT. OKAY ARM I SUPPORT. STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS PAPER AGROUND PAPER. PAGE TWENTY OF THE TWENTY THREE. I DON'T WANT TO REACH YOU YOU CAN READ IT RIGHT ON TOP STAFF RECOMMENDATION. SO I ALSO SUPPORT A COUPON SHIPBOARD. THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY HARD. BUT I DO HAVE A ONE COMMENT. AMY MY TECHIE THE CURRENT. PRESIDENT. OF THE BOARD. OF IS ASSOCIATE WITH HIGHLAND HOSTILITY I SEE I AM ORGANIZATION HOWEVER. A SHE IS LIKE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. RELATIVELY VERY VERY NEW THE MERGER MAJORITY OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE NEW. I NOTICE THERE ARE SIX OF THEM RIGHT NOW. ONLY ONE OR TWO YOU ARE FROM THE LAST. LAST LAST A CHARM. SO. KNOWING THAT. I THINK THAT UP BECAUSE OF THIS AS A DEBATING AS THE. WHETHER CALAIS OR OR NATIONAL EXAM. ISSUE BEING CARRY ON FOR FOR A VERY VERY LONG MAYBE IS GOOD IDEA FOR THE NEW BOARDS. ODD TO THINK ABOUT IT TO EAT RE EVALUATE MORE AND THEN I'LL HAVE ANOTHER VOTE. IT IS A POSSIBLE THANK YOU. A RUN SEIDMAN PRESIDENT OF FIVE BRANCHES UNIVERSITY. OF A GRADUATE SCHOOL OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE. AT FIRST THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEN AND SENATORS. FOR SUPPORTING OUR PROFESSION IT INTO. INTRODUCING A HIGHER REMUNERATION BY MEDICARE OUT. OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT CONTRIBUTION. AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE. ENCROACHMENT OF OUR PROFESSION. AND INSURANCE REMUNERATION ARE THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO TO ASSIST US AND THAT WILL BE APPRECIATED. AS FOR THE EXAMINATIONS. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. FOR. REQUIRED ALL THE AUTOMAKERS. TO HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF EXHAUST SYSTEMS TO COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND ALL THE OTHER STATES HAD TO FOLLOW ONE STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED ANOTHER. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE THAT WE CAN USE TODAY FOR THE NATIONAL EXAMINATION. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO PLAY IT'S REQUIRED LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS PROFESSION BECAUSE. WE ARE THE CLOSEST STATE TO ASIA WHERE THIS MEDICINE COMES FROM. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THE PROFESSION AND THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD TO SET. THIS IS THE NEW HIGHER STANDARD FOR THE NATIONAL EXAMINATION. EVENTUALLY IT MAY BE THE WHOLE OF THE US WILL TAKE THAT NEW HIGHER STANDARD. BUT CERTAINLY IS JERRY BROWN DID EARLIER WE CAN HAVE OUR OWN HIGH STANDARD IN THE BEGINNING AND HAVE THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A NATIONAL EXAMINATION. WHAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO BE DOING THIS YEAR? IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. ICD CODES THAT ARE USED BY ALL MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ALL OVER THE WORLD ICD NINE ICD TEN. AND IN THE FUTURE I SEE DI ELEVEN UP TILL NOW HAVE ONLY HAD WESTERN TERMINOLOGY. STARTING THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT'LL HAVE TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE TERMINOLOGY. AND. THIS OUGHT THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS NUMBER ONE OF COURSE TO HAVE STRONG EDUCATION. AND AND STRONG LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND TO HAVE A NATIONAL EXAM THANK YOU. HONORABLE CHAIRS. SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANGUS SIMMONS FULL DISCLOSURE ON THE SPOUSE OF AN ACUPUNCTURIST. FIRST MALL I I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A FULLY STAFFED FULLY FUNDED STRONG ACUPUNCTURE BORDER TO ENFORCE. THE BEST STANDARDS OF PRACTICE TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS. I THINK THAT THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING TO START. ACUPUNCTURE IS GETTING INTO MANY NEW AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES NOW THE TOP US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. CANCER HOSPITALS ALL HAVE ACUPUNCTURE AS PART OF THEIR. PROGRAM AND SERVICES. WILL SEE CHANGES WITH ACUPUNCTURISTS COMING INTO HOSPITALS. THE PROFESSION NEEDS TO BE READY TO TAKE UP THOSE ROLES THEY NEED TO BE READY UNTRAINED. EVEN WITH A CLINICAL TRAINING AND WESTERN HOSPITALS AS PART OF THEIR EDUCATION. THE STANDARDS OF. EDUCATION NEED TO BE ENFORCED BY A STRONG. EXAMINATION WE'VE SEEN FOR MANY YEARS THE PROFESSION HAS TRIED TO GET AT OF FOUR THOUSAND HOURS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE PRACTICE WE SEEN JUDY CHU. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TRIED TO BRING ACUPUNCTURE AND SHE'S PROPOSED BILL TO BRING ACUPUNCTURISTS THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM. AND INTO THE HOSPITALS WE'RE GOING TO SEE THESE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE. LUKE THE PROFESSION NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE EXAMINATIONS TO SUPPORT THAT AND ENABLE ACUPUNCTURIST TO WORK WITH DOCTORS IN A HOSPITAL SITUATION IS VERY NECESSARY. AND I HOPE THAT WE LOOK AT THE FUTURE. THINK ABOUT THAT AND. BE READY TO HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE EXAMINATION THANK YOU. HELLO THERE AND THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH US TODAY.

AND I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU I KNOW OUR TIME IS BRIEF. FIRST OF ALL A LETTER WAS THREE LETTERS WERE EMAIL TO THE STAKE HOLDERS THE OTHER DAY. OF THREW OUT SOMETHING IN THOSE OFFICE. WE DID WRITE A. RESPONSE POINT BY POINT TO SOME OF THOSE LETTERS. UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T GET TO A SOMETHING AS THOSE OFFICE TO LAST NIGHT I HOPE. THE MEMBERS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO READ AND SEE THAT WE RESPOND TO MANY OF THOSE ISSUES IN VERY GREAT DETAIL IN THAT RESPONSE AS WELL AS IN OUR. MOST RECENT EDITION OF THE CALIFORNIA NCC WHAM A FACT SHEET WHICH UP THERE IS A LINK TO IN THAT SO I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME GOING ALL OF THIS I KNOW THE TIME IS QUITE LIMITED. I DID WANT TO SAY THAT THE NCC WEB OF COURSE STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNIFICATION OF THIS PROFESSION WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. THE LACK OF UNITY IS HURTING OUR PROFESSION VERY BADLY. THE ACUPUNCTURE PROFESSION THE CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND THE PROFESSION IN OTHER STATES. AND OUR PROFESSION FACES NUMEROUS MAJOR THREATS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING BUT ALL OF US WHO WORK SO HARD AND SO LONG TO GAME. ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO UNIFIED NATIONAL ACUPUNCTURE PROFESSION. HAS BEEN THE LACK OF A SINGLE NATIONAL ENTRY LEVEL EXAMINATION. IN ALIGNMENT WITH EVERY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSION IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO A NATIONAL STANDARD UNIFIED PROFESSION AND A STRONG VOICE. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT I LEARNED THIS MORNING SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST ON THE BOARD. AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I THINK I HAVE THE SHEET THAT WAS HANDED TO ME HERE. BASICALLY WE HEARD A LOT OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY THIS MORNING. AT LEAST SIX BY MY COUNT OF THE PEOPLE TESTIFIED SO FAR SELF IDENTIFIED AS ASSOCIATED WITH THE A A CM AND OR HIGHLAND HOSPITAL. PERHAPS OTHERS ALSO REPRESENT THAT ORGANIZATION. DOCTOR ANY PATAKI IS THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD SHE HAS BEEN VERY STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ASSOCIATION AND IS TAKING POSITIONS THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT ASSOCIATION REGARDING. THE EXAMS SHEET TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER RECUSED HERSELF FROM ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS OR DISCUSSIONS AND IS NEVER DISCLOSED THAT ASSOCIATION. THAT APPEARS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND I THINK IN THE SENSE THAT HEARING THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS DOCTOR ALEX FANG. I AM NOT A LICENSED ACUPUNCTURIST I'M NOT HERE WITH AFFILIATE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY ORGANIZATION IS SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. I IF I WAS THE CHAIRMAN TO SEE IBM WHAT TIME PERIOD I WORKED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS AN EXTRA EXPERT. THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. ALSO I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE PROCESS OF ACUPUNCTURE. LEGALIZATION AND STANDARD FALL WHILE. IN MY OPINION EXAMS AN EXAM FEEL GOOD EXAM. AND YOU CAN PASS EXAMPLE ENTRY LEVEL. PRACTICE. THEY SHOULD BE ACCEPTED I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THAT. STANDARD IS REALLY IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS IT AT PRESIDENT IN TERMS OF STANDARD. AND THAT SHOULD BE. RESPECTED. AND HONORED. SAFETY MOST IMPORTANT AS A CONSUMER. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE COME IN. DOING OCCUPY JOIN ME A LICENSE AND QUALIFIED. AND THAT'S IS DONE THROUGH A PROCESS OF EXAMINATION. I HAVE. A QUESTION RAISED ABOUT DOCTOR MAY TAKE HE AND AND NOT. PUBLIC INTEREST. YOU KNOW. TO ME THAT'S A RIDICULOUS STATEMENT BECAUSE. THEY ARE FEW MD SITTING ON THE ON THE BOARD AND YOU A CONFLICT OF INTEREST I CAN PROBABLY PICK UP ALL KINDS OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. WITHIN ALL WITHIN A. ANY ORGANIZATION. IF YOU HAVE AN OPINION. AND THEN OUT OF THE ORGANIZATION TO SCREAM AT YOU AND BECOMES A CONFLICT INTERESTS AS A POLITICAL PROBLEM. SO SAFETY. STANDARD. AND RECIPROCITY. AND. WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS ONE OF THE. PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT OF OUR FINANCES YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. MEDICOS PAINT AS ANYBODY KNOWS SIX DOLLARS. ANYBODY HERE PAY SIX DOLLARS GETTING PAID SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR OR AS. IS RIDICULOUS PRICE SO TO PUT A LOT OF BURDEN ON ACUPUNCTURIST TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW EQUAL RESPECT AND RECIPROCITY FOR THE THE AMOUNT OF PAY THAT GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO. SUPPORT. THE SINK YOU VERY MUCH WONDERFUL THING THANK YOU. MEMBERS MY NAME IS NEIL MILLER I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR THIRTY YEARS. IT IN THIS THIRTY YEARS I'VE ATTENDED EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD MEETINGS. AND I'VE ATTENDED EVERY SUNSET REVIEW HEARING. MY OPINION IS THAT THIS SUNSET REVIEW COMMITTEE. SEEMS TO BE THE MOST. INVESTED. IN SAYING THAT THE STANDARD. AND THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSUMER. WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL INFLUENCE THAT YOU'RE REALLY LISTENING AND REALLY TRYING. MEMBER LOW HAS REALLY. BEEN EXTRAORDINARY IN REACHING OUT TO THE PROFESSION ON EITHER AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER. UP FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE AS A LEGISLATOR AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT AS A PROFESSION. TWO MINUTES IS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE ISSUES I WILL BE SUBMITTING A DETAILED. RESPONSE TO ALL THE DIFFERENT POINTS THAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS. I'M BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF. COMMENT HERE. THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD CHANGES IT CHANGES WITH EACH GOVERNOR WITH EACH LEGISLATURE. ON AND WHAT WE. NEED IS A CONSISTENT STAFF AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH MANY STAFF TO MANY EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS. BUT LIKE TO SPEAK UP ON BEHALF OF MR BODEGA. HE CAME UP WITH THIS AS A STAFF MEMBER AND NOW HE'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS I BELIEVE IT HE HAS THE MOST. DEDICATION AND QUALIFICATION. TO REALLY LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS OF THE OF OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE HEARING. A COMMITTEE. AND AND TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE. MISTER GIBSON BROUGHT UP SOME. COMMENTS REGARDING ENFORCEMENT AND THE TIME OF ENFORCEMENT. I CAN SAY HAVING WATCHED THIS FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT THE BOARD IS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB. THERE STILL ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT HE'S DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB. MISTER PANTS CONCERNS REGARDING CONTINUING EDUCATION AND AND THOSE THINGS. THE BOARD IS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB. THE THE CURRENT BOARD WILL PROBABLY CHANGEWILL GET AND GOVERNOR SOON. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE LEGISLATURE AND ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND THAT THERE'S A COMMON DIRECTION. LASTLY. I'LL JUST ALLUDE THINGS ABOUT IT DID YOU MR MILLER. THE TIMES THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING IS BECAUSE I'M NOT EVERY SPOKEN. ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHICH IS BECAUSE I'VE NOT SPOKEN OKAY THAT WILL CONCLUDE THE PORTION OF THE MEETING. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I WANT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE REMIND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT. THERE WILL BE A BILL HEARING WITH RESPECT TO. THE. SUNSET OF THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD ALSO WANTED THINGS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR DRIVING MILES AND COMING QUITE A DISTANCE TO SHARE SOME INSIGHTS AND INPUT WITH RESPECT TO THE. JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND AGAIN OF THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT TO BEGIN THIS CONVERSATION OF THIS AS A STARTING POINT AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONNECT WITH. BOTH THE SENATE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE FAMILY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. AND THAT BUT TO CONCLUDE OUR PORTION CENTERED WHO WOULD YOU CARE TO. SHARE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WHO HAD NO IT THIS DEPRECIATED BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE SO NECESSARY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE OF. THE BOARDS OF THANK YOU FOR THAT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WANTED TO BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE WON STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION ROUTE RATHER THAN. HAVING SUCH FUN VEERING VIEWPOINTS AND OF COURSE THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF A DIVERSITY OF OPINION WHICH IS NORMAL AND EXPECTED AND SODA TO ENCAPSULATE THE DESIRES MOST CERTAINLY WHEN DEALING WITH THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN. THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY AND MESSAGING SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH RESPECT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HERE. ON THE CALIPHATE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WILL NOW THEN TRANSITION. TO THE NEXT ITEM AND I WILL NOW CAN WE GO OVER TO. MR HILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR LOW APPRECIATED IN THE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY WE'RE NOW MOVING TO THE REVIEW OF THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA THAT LIKE TO INVITE TO TO THE DAYS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE RAISED ISSUES IN THE. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUSAN GOOD COMMITTEE PRESIDENT AND MICHELLE. PEARL BUT COMMITTEE MEMBER AND ANTHONY LONG. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SO WELCOME. THIS. THIS. YEAH. OKAY ARE THE ISSUES. THAT. GOOD MORNING. WELCOME THIS MORNING IN THE THANK YOU FOR. BEING ABLE TO SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS THIS MORNING AND. AND LET IS KNOW HOW VIA THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE FOR KING TO THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED. YEAH. AND YOU MAY NEVER. I. SAID I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE AND A PUBLIC MEMBER FROM FRESNO. WITH ME IS MICHELLE HURLED AT THE DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATOR A MEMBER FROM UPLAND. AND OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER ANTHONY LOMB. HISTORICALLY THE TWO THOUSAND TWO JOINT LEGISLATIVE SUNSET REVIEW COMMITTEE COMPLETED ITS REVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE ON DENTAL AUXILIARIES AND DETERMINED THAT DENTAL HYGIENIST HAD REACHED A POINT. WHERE THE RESPONSIBILITY WARRANTED AN INDEPENDENT REGULATORY BODY SEPARATE FROM THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA? SO WITH THE PASSAGE OF SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY THREE AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WERE ESTABLISHED IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE. SINCE THEN WE'VE WORKED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR MANDATED FUNCTIONS TO OVERSEE THE DENTAL HYGIENE LICENSEE POPULATION AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. AND OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. WE COMPLETED OUR FIRST SUNSET REVIEW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND MINIMAL OPERATIONAL ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE SUNSET COMMITTEE. OF NOTE OUR PROGRAM REPRESENTS THE ONLY INDEPENDENT DENTAL HYGIENE REGULATORY BODY PARTS KIND IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE THREE LICENSING CATEGORIES OF DENTAL HYGIENIST. REGISTERED DENTAL% HYGIENIST REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST IN ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE AND REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST AND EXTENDED FUNCTIONS. UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA IS THE REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST IN DENTAL HYGIENE SERVICES IN. NURSING HOMES RESIDENCES OF THE HOME BOUND. SCHOOLS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND IN FEDERALLY. ESTABLISHED UNDERSERVED AREAS WHERE RESIDENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING DENTAL CARE DUE TO THE LACK OF PROVIDERS. WE'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN OUR REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF ALL CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AFTER HAVING RECEIVED MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS FROM PROGRAM STUDENTS FACULTY AND THE PUBLIC. AND UPON INVESTIGATION FINDING THAT MARGINAL OVERSIGHT HAD BEEN GIVEN BY THE NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY IN THE PAST. MORE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THIS AREA AND MORE WILL BE NEEDED IN THE YEARS AHEAD TO EXPEDITE THE ONGOING REVIEW OF THE PROGRAMS AND TO ENSURE. CONSUMERS FACULTY STUDENTS AND DENTAL PATIENTS A PROGRAM FACILITY CLINICS ARE PROTECTED. WE ARE SELF REGULATING AGENCY AND HAVE AUTHORITY OVER ALL ASPECTS OF LICENSURE FROM APPROVAL BALL LICENSURE APPLICATIONS EXAMINATION ADMINISTRATION. ENFORCEMENT AN INVESTIGATION OF LICENSEES. WE ALSO PURSUE LEGISLATION PROMOTE GATE REGULATIONS ANTICS OF GRIEVANCES FROM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE PROFESSION. WE PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE A LEVEL OF COMPETENCY IN ALL APPLICANTS IN LICENSE FEES AND TO FULFILL OUR PRIMARY MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE ARE A SPECIAL FUND AGENCY AND GENERATE ALL OUR REVENUE FROM LICENSURE APPLICATION FEES COLLECTED SO HAVE NO FISCAL IMPACT ON THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND. WE'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT OF MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND LICENSES SINCE OUR ON SECTION AND WE CURRENTLY OVERSEA WAR THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND ACTIVE LICENSEES. IN CONCLUSION OUR COMMITTEE IS YOUNG COMPARED TO MANY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THAT HAVE OPERATED FOR DECADES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF FORMATIVE WORK. TO ADDRESS AND AS WE DO WE ARE COMMITTED TO CARRYING OUT OUR VISION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO QUALITY DENTAL HYGIENE CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BALL CONTINUING OUR MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. WE THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT US. AND FOR YOUR HELP AS WE NAVIGATED THROUGH THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. THERE WERE FOUR ISSUES THAT YOU COULD ASK OUR OUR COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS. THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE COMMITTEE IS STRUGGLING TO MEET OUR STATUTORY MANDATES BECAUSE OF STAFFING SHORTAGES AND TO ADDRESS THAT IS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. ANTHONY LONG. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN. COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. OUR STRUGGLES WITH A STAFFING ARE VERY WELL KNOWN TO US AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL STUFF. AND. GOING FORWARD WITH OUR PROPOSALS WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. SO THAT WAY HOPEFULLY. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR PROPOSALS AND REQUESTS MORE SUCCESSFUL. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED US TO ADDRESS COMMITTEES IS ON THE. COMMITTEE WANTS TO BE RENAMED AS AN INDEPENDENT BOARD UNDER THE. DCA AND SEVER ITS REMAINING TIES TO THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OUR CHARTER ONE OF OUR CHARTER MEMBERS HERE WITH US AND MICHELLE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M DR MICHELLE HURL BUT I'M THE DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATOR. AND THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS I WAS PRESIDENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE DURING OUR FIRST SUNSET REVIEW. OF THIS ISSUE CAME UP IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND. THIS COMMITTEE ASKED US TO. GO BACK AND CONTINUE TO WORK AND AND GATHER INFORMATION ON WHETHER OR NOT INDEED THERE WAS CONFUSION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. ARE RELATED TO. THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEES NAME WHICH IS A DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE. WE DO APPRECIATE THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO CHANGE OUR NAME AND WE DO HOPE THAT. SP FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE THAT. AS BACKGROUND THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISHED. THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE INCLUDED JURISDICTION LANGUAGE. TO PROVIDE A LEGAL BASIS FOR US TO UTILIZE THE DENTAL BOARD. DURING OUR FORMATIVE YEARS. DURING THAT TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND ACTUALLY PRIOR TO THAT TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE A COUPLE BILLS THAT. THAT KIND OF CAME FORWARD BEFORE WE ACTUALLY WERE SUCCESSFUL THERE WASN'T ELEMENT OF UNKNOWN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE WAS DRAFTED. AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WANTED TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE. AT THE CURRENT CURRENT LANGUAGE THE CURRENT JURISDICTION LANGUAGE A CONTINUES TO CAUSE CONFUSION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS BOTH IN STATE. AND OUT OF STATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DENTAL BOARD HAS ACTIVE OVERSIGHT. OF THE OF THE DHC SEE WHEN THEY DO NOT. I'M ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITHIN EXISTING LAW. THE LANGUAGE THAT DESCRIBES AND LISTS THE PURPOSE AND POWERS OF BOARDS ARE WE MEET ALL OF THOSE ALL OF THAT CRITERIA. AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE ASKING TO CHANGE OUR NAME FROM THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE DENTAL HYGIENE BOARD. OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE NEXT ISSUE THAT THE ACTIVITIES ASKED US TO ADDRESS IS OTHER COMMITTEES OF THE COMMITTEE THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE DOES NOT HAVE. THE AUTHORITY TO PACE DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON PROBATION OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGN FINE PROGRAMS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. HANDOUT TO ONCE AGAIN ANTHONY MOM OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILL ADDRESS THAT. UNDER THE LAW FOR US TO REVIEW DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAS BEEN IN STATUTE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT U UNTIL LAST FEW YEARS REVIEWS HAVE BEEN RELIANT ON THE NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AS A RESULT OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED SOME STUDENTS FACULTY AND THE PUBLIC AND AFTER OUR EDUCATION REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED. WE INCREASED OUR VIEW OF THE DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY IF A PROGRAM IS DEFICIENT OF THE LAW OR ACCREDITATION STANDARDS THE ONLY OPTION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US. AS A CONSEQUENCE IS TO WITHDRAW THE COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL FOR THE PROGRAM. THIS IS A PENALTY THAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO USE BECAUSE ORIGINALLY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD. ABIDE BY THE THE ACCREDITING AGENCIES REVIEWS OF THE PROGRAMS AND STICK WITH THAT AND NOT NEED TO. HAVE FOR THE REVIEWS OF THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER WITH THE COMPLAINTS THAT CAME IN IT WARRANTED US TO GO IN TO REVIEW THEM JUST LIKE IF WE CAN PROCEED TO COMPLAIN AGAINST THE LICENSEE. WE WERE SEATED AGAINST THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SO WE THOUGHT. ACTING ON IT WOULD BE THE BEST INTEREST OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. IN THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'VE HAD THE USE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROGRAMS TWICE. FOR A GREETING EGREGIOUS DISCOVERIES FOUND AT A COUPLE OF THE SCHOOLS. THE NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY ONLY REVIEWS THE SCHOOLS EVERY SEVEN YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN FOUND TO PROVIDE MARGINAL FOLLOW UP ON ON THEM. THAT ARE DEFICIENT OTHER STANDARDS. AFTER A SITE VISIT. THIS IS THE REASON THE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO REVIEW THESE PROGRAMS ON A MORE FREQUENT AND CONSISTENT BASIS AND HAVE ALTERNATIVES. THAN TO FULLY WITHDRAW PROGRAMS APPROVAL FOR LESS SERIOUS INFRACTIONS. TO REQUEST IS TO HAVE THE INTERMEDIATE INTERMEDIARY ABILITY TO PLACE DENTAL HYGIENE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON PROBATION OR SITE AND FIND THEM FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. AND THE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS. THANK YOU. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE THAT THE COMMITTEE'S ASKED US TO ADDRESS. IS THE FACT THAT THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE DOES NOT HAVE. DOES NOT USE ITS AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT A DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND. PERHAPS IT WOULD WISH TO REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT. TO ESTABLISH A DIVERSION PROGRAM. ARE WE REQUEST. TO TABLE THIS ISSUE. UNTIL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER DISCUSS AND REVIEW IT NOW THAT THERE ARE NEW CANNABIS LAWS IN PLACE. AND ARE THEY WEREN'T THERE WHEN THE DECISION TO REMOVE THE DIVERSION WAS MADE. WE ARE AWARE OF THE CURRENT CLIMATE ALSO WITH OPIOID ANTI ALCOHOL OVER USE AND UP BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW THE FULL EFFECT. OF THESE LAWS ON THE DENTAL HYGIENE PROFESSION. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT IS NOT THE TIME TO ADDRESS THE REMOVAL OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAM LANGUAGE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THOSE AND I DO KNOW SOME OF THE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I HAD ONE IF I COULD. ASK IS THAT THE YOU KNOW THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES HOW WE HOW WE WOULD YOU NAVIGATE THOSE. ISSUES WITH THE DENTAL BOARD IF YOU CHANGE TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT BOARD HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP AND. IN SOME OF THE SCOPE ISSUES. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DENTAL BOARD WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT. AND WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AS WE HAVE BUTTER TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT. I WILL DEFER TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER. ONLY IN LAW WHAT WHAT IT IS IS IF WE HAVE A SCOPE OF PRACTICE CHANGE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD ADDRESS WITH THE DENTAL BOARD. IT'S IT STATES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT SCOPE REQUEST TO THE DENTAL BOARD AND THEN THEY HAVE TIME TO REVIEW THAT. IT DOESN'T INDICATE ANYTHING AS FAR AS THE DENTAL BOARD APPROVING IT BUT WE WOULD HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THAT CHANGES GO PRACTICE. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE AND AND. REALLY AGREEABLE TO THE CHANGE OKAY GOOD AND ALSO I APPRECIATE THAT THIS SITE AND FIND. HIM QUESTION AN ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE THAT IN THE. IN THE SENSE THAT BILL THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY IN THE FUTURE ONE OTHER IS IS THERE SOMEONE HERE FROM DCA. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT BE INTERESTING TO GET SOME INFORMATION ON THE STAFFING QUESTION THAT THAT WE'VE RAISED A NEW PHRASE TO SEE WHAT THE. THEIR INTENTIONS INTENTIONS ARE AND AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN HELPING AND AND WORKING TOWARDS THAT SO WE'LL HAVE TO. ASK HIM THAT QUESTION NEXT WEEK WHEN THEY'RE HERE TO. DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPEND. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I DID HAVE A. COUPLE QUESTIONS WILL ONE IS ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF THE WAR AND THAT THE FIVE YEAR MEMBERS WERE LYSIS FINISHING IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH OF COURSE I PASS THAT. WE GOT ALL NEW REPLACEMENTS NOW OR WHAT THAT WHAT'S THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP. THE. MAN I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE. AND WE HAVE ALL HAD. OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE APPOINTMENTS ON STAFF EIGHT AND WE WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL HEAR MID YEAR WE HAVE A. WE HAVE A ONE YEAR GRACE PERIOD. ONE ARM AND SO WE'RE WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN BE REAPPOINTED. OKAY WELL OKAY SO. YEAH I I JUST WONDERING ABOUT ALSO IN TERMS OF. PLAY FOR FUTURE I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING BECAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A ON WHETHER. TERMS OF FIGURE HOW TO STAGGER. WHO'S WELL SO YOU DON'T END UP HAVING YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE AND CERTAINLY HALF OF THEM LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME. SO. THE THE QUESTION OF IS THE CONTINUING EDUCATION US SO JUST KIDDING WAS WONDERING I DON'T JUST PICK ON ONE BOARD ABOUT THIS. THE. SO ICE I NOTE NOW SIS IS THAT. DTC HAS CONDUCTED FORTY SEVEN C. ARTISTS IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS CELL THAT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT IN A LOT MORE DENTAL HYGIENISTS THAT I THINK GREAT. I MEAN I KNOW YOU JUST WOULD NOT EXPECT YOU THOUGHT EVERYBODY JUST A SAMPLE BUT. AND. IN THAT AUDIT EVEN ONLY FORTY SEVEN YOU FOUND THE TENDON FELT THAT TWENTY ONE PERCENT WHICH IS SO WHAT IS THE BORDER DOING TO STEP UP THE NUMBER OF AUDITS AND ALSO ENSURING. THAT PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THEIR C. E. I MEAN ICE SOON PART OF THE REASON. WE'RE TALKING IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE FIELD THAT I GENTLY ON. ORAL HEALTH AND. IS STILL ADVANCING AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO KEEP UP SO WELL WHAT WE DOING ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS CERTAINLY WHEN WE WERE PREPARING. THE SENSE THAT WE. WE DID AND DOWN ON THE FOR AGAIN TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OKAY. WHAT PART OF THE PLAN IS? WHY DID HAVE? A POSITION IN PLACE TO ADDRESS. CONTINUING C. E. AUDITS. HOWEVER WITH THE WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM REVIEWS AND ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN. I'VE HAD TO ACTUALLY READ DIRECTOR FULL TIME TO JUST THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. AND WHAT I'VE BEEN. AND WILL DO CAN CONTINUE TO DO IS REQUEST. POSITIONS TO ADDRESS OUR C. AUDITS CURRENTLY. WE'VE CONDUCTED THEM IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SCHOOL REVIEWS AS FAR AS INSURING THAT THE FACULTY ARE HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SEE EASE. AND ALSO IF WE HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT CASE WE ALSO DO AN AUDIT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE AS WELL. BUT IT OVERALL IN GENERAL I JUST NEED ADDITIONAL. STAFF TO TO HELP US WITH THAT WORKLOAD A SOLICITOR STAFF REQUEST IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. UNFORTUNATELY. THERE WERE THERE WAS BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH. OKAY WELL THERE SHOULD BE THEN RIGHT YELLING ME I WILL BE I WILL BE RE SUBMITTING IT THIS YEAR. ATTACKS SO WE SHOULD COMMUNICATE THAT TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND. OKAY I RESPECTED BUDGET COMMITTEES I REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MAYBE THE ADMINISTRATION BUT. I THINK OF WHEN WE REVEAL ISSUES LIKE THIS IN OUR POLICY COMMITTEES AND OUR OVERSIGHT. WE SHOULD ALSO INFORM OUR COLLEAGUES AT HIS SERVE ON OUR RESPECTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEES THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE IT'S COME UP W CAN YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT WE KEEP HEARING BOARD AFTERWARDS AND A SHORT STAFFING. AND IF THE YOU KNOW I MEAN WE WE NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON OUR END SO I HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN. AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT IN I WILL FOLLOW UP. AND THEN AND THEN I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE YOUR TEAM A COMMAND SO RIGHT ON THAT AND BUT WE WE GOT TO DO OUR JOB TO. AND WE. THAT'S OUR JOB TO PASS A BUDGET. IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF PROVING C. COURSES AND PROVIDERS AGAIN I KNOW THAT IT SAYSDOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAFF RESOURCES I KNOW YOU SO WHAT'S THE THE. USE OF THE PEN ON THE DATA BOARD SO AS TO HOW DOES THAT WORK IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE C. COURSES. TERMS OF APPROVAL C. CORSON PROVIDERS. AND IT ALSO ASSURING THAT THE QUALITY OF THE C. COURSES MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT UP THIS TREND IS NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST. OF THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE TEACHING. THEIR NOT JUST TEACHING A COURSE TO PROMOTE SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL THAT IS TRULY A C. COURSE SO WHAT WHAT HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP WORKING WITH THE DENTAL BOARD. IS AT AN END IN TERMS OF YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE STAFF HE'LL DO THAT YOURSELF CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT. SURE. AS FAR AS WHAT'S IN OUR LAWS IS THAT WE CAN READILY ACCEPT THE DENTAL BOARD SEAT A PROVIDER APPROVALS. AND WE WE RELY ON THEM FOR THE VETTING OF THE PROVIDERS OF THOSE COURSES. AND IT IS IN OUR STATUTE IS AS WELL TO PROVIDE TO APPROVE SEE PROVIDERS BUT AGAIN ONCE WE GET ADEQUATE STAFFING THEN WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE DO RELY ON THE THE DELAPORTE STAFF TO VET THE PROVIDERS. THESE ANY I MEAN. HOW'S THAT WORKING. IT'S BEEN WORKING FINE. AND I'VE BEEN THERE I'VE BEEN WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR SIX YEARS. AND OVERSEEING IN A MANAGEMENT ROLE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN AND. I HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES AS FAR AS PROVIDERS ARE CONCERNED OR AND ACCEPTING THEM FOR SECRET OKAY SO I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE WANT MORE DUPLICATION EITHER SELF THERE'S AN ARRANGEMENT THAT WORKS THAT'S GUIDES ON THE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING THAT FACE. YES WELL. I KNOW THE MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT. IN TERMS OF DIVERSION I I I I APPRECIATE THAT DO YOU THINK. BASICALLY SO AS A CAREER IN THE FIELD AND IF THERE IS AN ABILITY TO. BE SURE ANSWERED THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS WHILE ALLOWING THE PERSON TO. YOU KNOW IT'S WE SHOULD WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT SO APPRECIATE YOUR STILL CONSIDERING THAT AND. NOT. AS WELL AND THEN. FINALLY I THINK THAT. IN TERMS OF. I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION IN OUR ABOUT THE ROLE OF. I LIKE OUR D. EIGHTY EIGHT P. SO YES A REGISTERED. DENTAL HYGIENIST ADVANCE PRACTICES THAT WAS ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE RIGHT. I THINK WHETHER THINGS YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK THAT. I'VE SEEDED HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE THE DOW BOARD AND DENTAL COMMUNITY. HEALTH. LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE COME IN HERE TO US AND SAY WELL WE NEED TO ALLOW SOMEONE HAVE EXPANSE GO BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTAGE SOMEWHERE. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS OKAY FINE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE THIS AREA BUT NOW WE WANT FOR EVERYBODY. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMEONE WHO DOES WORK FORCE. NOW PEOPLE LIKE ONE BIG CHALLENGES AND THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE IN AND THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS IS IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE PRACTICING IN THE BURBS AND STUFF AND THEY LIKE TO LIVE THERE. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU CAN POINT IF YOU SAID IF YOU START EXPANDING IT TO EVERYBODY. THAN WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE NOT DIVORCED ALISON ROLLER STAY THERE BUT THE NEW PEOPLE DON'T MOVE BACK ARTICLES NOT HERE ACTUALLY LIKE UNDER CUT YOUR BILLY SEND THEM THAT'S. SO THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL DISCUSSION YOUR JOB STANDARDS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. THAT YELLED AS THE ORIGINAL RATIONALE IS ABOUT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BENTON THE CONSEQUENCES OF WE NOW. CHANGE THE RULES AGAIN. SO. SO CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE STANDARDS BASED DISCUSSION IS UP BUT ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE WORK FOR IF THE WORKFORCE IS WHAT THE REASON RATIONAL FOR DRIVING THE ORIGINAL CHANGE WE STILL HAVE TO FACTOR IN THE WORKFORCE ISSUES. AS WELL COMING BACK. IF YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR AND OTHER QUESTIONS IS. THERE A. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THAT PACKWOOD CONCERN I HAD WAS WITH RESPECT TO INTEGRATIVE COMPREHENSIVE A DENTAL CARE AND IN A DENTAL OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. AND SO ALLOWING ONE TEAM ON WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE TO DETERMINE IT WITHOUT CONSULTATION OF THE OTHER COULD HAVE BE OF POTENTIAL CONCERN QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT. IS IS AN ISSUE. AS FAR AS LIKE OVERLAP OR BUT THE VICTOR THE CONFLICT THAT MIGHT EXIST IN AN IN WITH RESPECT TO SCOPE. THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE WITH. THE DETERMINATION OF OF YOUR YOUR ENTITY VERSUS THAT OF THE OF THE DENTAL BOARD AND NOT AS A TALKING WITH OTHERS LIGHTS AND PROFESSIONALS. WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD RELAIONSHIP WITH THE ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE DENTAL BOARD. AND WE DO HAVE A REALLY GOOD. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US AND THE WE ASK FOR FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE IT WE HAVE. WE ATTEND THERE ABOUT THEIR MEETINGS THEY ATTEND OUR SWEET GONE TO CONVENTIONS UP WITH REPRESENTATIVE FROM OUR COMMITTEE. WE ACTUALLY FEEL THAT WE ARE GETTING REALLY GOOD INPUT BUT LET ME ASK LET ME DEFER TO ME MICHELLE BEING IN THE INDUSTRY. I'M I I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH IN IN PARTICULAR WITH THE DENTAL BOARD. BUT IN PRACTICE AT THE DENTIST EMPLOYERS STILL SUPERVISES. THE DENTAL HYGIENISTS ON WITH REGARD TO SCOPE WE DO HAVE. IN OUR STATUTES THAT IF WE WANTED IF THE COMMITTEE WANTED THE AGENCY WANTED TO CHANGE. ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE AT THAT RECOMMENDATION WOULD GO BEFORE THE DENTAL BOARD AND. WE AMENDED THE STATUTE TO REQUIRE THE DENTAL BOARD TO RESPOND WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION BACK TO THE DH CC. SO I I I DON'T DISSIPATE THAT CHANGING IF IN FACT WE ARE LABELED AS A DENTAL HYGIENE BOARD. I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING AT ALL BREAK AND THEN TO THAT TO THAT COME THEY JUST MADE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF COMEDIAN BORDERS ARE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THAT OF OF THE NAME. WE CURRENTLY PERFORM ALL FUNCTIONS OF A BOARD. IT'S JUST THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATION CAME INTO PLAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. THERE WAS. CONCERNED. THE POWERS TO BE ONE AND THE NAME COMMITTEE VERSUS BOARD. ON THE JUST WAS A CONCERN ABOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BOARDS AT THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT THE. COMMITTEE'S NAME BECAME COMMITTEE. SO FOR ME THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THE THE IT'S JUST A NAME CHANGE THERE'S NO LATE AT THE NAME CHANGE AND. THERE'S SOME JURISDICTION LANGUAGE OUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE OF OUR. EVER CODE. THAT SAYS WERE UNDER THE DENTAL BOARD WHICH WE. REALLY AREN'T BECAUSE WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT BOARD. AND I HAVE HEARD TOO THAT WHEN WHEN WE'RE LABELED A COMMITTEE IT IT'S IT'S. IT'S KIND OF A TRANSPARENCY THANK WHERE. OUR STAKE HOLDERS HAVE SAID WHEN WE'RE TITLED THE COMMITTEE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE A SUBDIVISION OF SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN PUTTING THIS REQUEST AND SO THAT WAY SINCE WE'VE BEEN FUNCTIONING AS AN AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENTAL BODY. THAT WE SHOULD BE TITLED AS SUCH. IN OUR IN THE LAW THAT. IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE THAT GIVES THE THE DEFINITION OF A BOARD IT'S HIS BOARD BEER OR COMMISSION BUT THERE'S NO MENTION OF COMMITTEE. SO THAT'S JUST THE THE MISUNDERSTANDING THAT'S OUT THERE IS THAT IF YOUR COMMITTEE YOU SEEM TO BE A SUBSET OF SOMETHING ELSE I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ALSO THAT BEFORE THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE WITH THE COMMITTEE WAS. WHAT'S THIS INDEPENDENT BODY. WE FUNCTION DENTAL HYGIENE FUNCTION UNDER THE COMMITTEE ON DENTAL EXHILARATION AND SO I THINK THE CONFUSION THERE'S STILL THAT CONFUSION THAT WERE YOU KNOW THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE IS STILL THE. COMMITTEE OF DENTAL AUXILIARIES WHICH WAS UNDER THE DENTAL BOARD AND SO THAT'S WHAT OUR STAKEHOLDERS TELL US BOTH IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE. EVEN TO THE POINT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE CONFUSED AS WELL ABOUT WHO OVERSEES WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE FEEL THAT THE NAME SHOULD BE BORED BECAUSE WE INDEED ARE ABOARD. UNDER IN THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW WE HAD. BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE WAIT BECAUSE PERHAPS. WITH MORE TENURE ON THE COMMITTEE MORE YEARS OF PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT WE PLAY WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT THAT IT'S THE THE MISUNDERSTANDING IS STILL THERE EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. GOOD THANK YOU AND. IN YOUR CORRECT FOUR YEARS AGO THE. THE IDEA WAS TO ALLOW FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS WHICH ARE THE NEXT SUNSET TO SEE IF. THE EVOLUTION OF A WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THAT IT WORKED AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED OUT QUITE NICELY AS WE GO ON AS WE'VE GONE FORWARD. OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEN NONE THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE WILL BE CONSISTENT AS WITH THE PREVIOUS A. PUBLIC HEARING WE WILL ALLOW FOR A TWO MINUTE COMIC. TWO MINUTES OF COMING FOR PERSONS OF. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS MARY MCKENNA I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. I CDA APPRECIATES THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY INVESTED IN THE DH CC AND BELIEVES THAT THE CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THIRTY EIGHT CC AND THE DENTAL BOARD. REALLY REFLECTS THE. INTERCONNECTED WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. THE MEMBERS WHO TOGETHER. ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY DENTAL CARE. I CDA HAS ALREADY SUBMITTED A WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENT OUTLINING THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE EIGHTY EIGHT CC SUNSET REVIEW REPORT. BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL ENTITIES AS THIS MOVES TO THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JENNIFER TANNA HELL WITH AARON READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH AT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH CARE IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE INCREASING ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT METHOD FOR DECREASING THE NEED FOR MORE SERIOUS DENTAL SERVICES IMPROVING OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWERING HEALTHCARE COSTS. SUNSET REVIEW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO DISCUSS THE BEST. HOW TO BEST EXTENT THE DENTAL TEAM INTO OUR COMMUNITY? THE VHA SUPPORTS EXTENDING THE DH CC SUNSET IN ADDITION WE SUPPORT ALLOWING FOR MORE GENERAL SUPERVISION RATHER THAN DIRECT. UNDER GENERAL SUPERVISION SERVICES THAT RT AGES AND PROVIDE SAFELY FOR DECADES ARE PROVIDED USING STANDARD PROTOCOLS AT THE DENTIST'S DISCRETION. THE VHA SUPPORTS ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO ACCESS PREVENTIVE DENTAL HYGIENE HYGIENE CARE IN MORE SETTINGS AND SUCH AS CLINICS IN PEDIATRIC OFFICES AND ALLOWING OUR AGES AND THE INDEPENDENT RT HA PEAS. TO COLLABORATE WITH MORE PROVIDERS AND PHYSICIAN. CDJ SUPPORTS REMOVING THE BARRIERS TO CARE PROVIDED AT THE BEDSIDE FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED. IN NURSING HOMES THEN I CAL NOW REQUIRES RT AJ PIECE TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE TREATING THOSE SPECIAL NEEDS PATIENTS WHO HAVE. DONALD MC. THEN I CAN ALSO CUT THE REIMBURSEMENT FROM A HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS DOWN TO FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS WHICH IS LESS THAN WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE THAT TREATMENT THE PERIODONTAL DISEASE. IT'S WORTH IT TO THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE DENTAL INSURANCE BUT STILL DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO REPENTANCE ORAL HEALTH CARE. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES DURING SUNSET REVIEW. CALIFORNIA DELL HI JANICE ARE EAGER TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE OF GREATER ASSISTANCE IF A FEW OBSTACLES CURRENTLY IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ARE REMOVED. AND THEN I CAL BARRIERS TO CARING FOR THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED ARE RESOLVED THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LIZ MORE I'M A REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST WITH A MASTERS IN EDUCATION AND I AM THE EDITOR OF THE CD HHR ANIL. ALONG WITH THE SOLUTIONS FOR EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE DENTAL TEAM THAT JENNIFER JUST MENTIONED. CD HA SUPPORTS REMOVING OBSOLETE JURISDICTION LANGUAGE FROM THE BNP CODE IT STATES THAT THE DENTAL HYGIENE COMMITTEE IS WITHIN THE DOW BOARD. THIS IS THE D. H. CC SECOND SUNSET REVIEW AS AN INDEPENDENT BODY WHICH GOVERNS ALL ASPECTS OF THE DENTAL HYGIENE PRACTICE. THE H. CC HAS SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED AUTONOMOUSLY FOR OVER A DECADE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE FIRST CREATED THE DH CC. JURISDICTION LANGUAGE ENABLED THE ACC TO USE THE DOWNWARD RESOURCES. UNTIL DH CC WAS UP AND RUNNING. HOWEVER THE DH CC NEVER NEEDED TO USE THE DENTAL BOARD RESOURCES SO JURISDICTION WAS MEANINGLESS. CONFUSING JURISDICTION LANGUAGE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE OPERATIONS OF BOTH THE D. H. CC. AND THE DENTAL BOARD CREATING MORE WORK FOR BOTH AGENCIES. THE LANGUAGE CREATES THE ARONIE US IMPRESSIONS OF THE DENTAL BOARD ACTIVELY PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE CHEC. WHICH IT DOES NOT. THIS SITUATION ALSO GIVES THE WRONG IMPRESSION. THAT RT AGES AND ARTIE HA PEAS ARE NOT QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE DENTAL TEAM. AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNDER UTILIZATION. OF AVAILABLE LICENSED PROVIDERS. INSURANCE COMPANIES AND EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HAVE LIMITED ALREADY AGES AND RTHK PEAS AS BILLABLE PROVIDERS DESPITE AUTHORIZATION IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO RD AGES HAVE PRACTICED IN PUBLIC HEALTH SETTINGS AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN RTHK PEAS. PROVIDED PREVENTIVE DENTAL HYGIENE CARE INDEPENDENTLY. TWO DECADES. THE CONFUSING LANGUAGE ALSO LEADS OTHER ENTITIES TO NOT RECOGNIZE RT HAZ RT AGES AND OUR DJ PEAS AS BILLABLE PROVIDERS. THIS SEVERELY LIMITS THE PROVIDER POOL AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA IS SEEKING MORE ORAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. NOT FEWER. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO FINALLY REMOVE THIS AWKWARD LANGUAGE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK UNDER. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. TEAM NO ONE WILL COME BACK TO THE HEARING AND THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A FOR THE YEARS NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. OF WHAT YOU GROW BEYOND THAT IN THE NEXT.
