TESTIFY ON THE SAME SIDE WITH

WE DO HAPPEN TO AGREE. THAT.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.130 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS WITH

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:41.499 region:rollup2
THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD THAT

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:44.636 region:rollup2

WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE ONLY

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:55.780 region:rollup2
STATE IN THE NATION THAT HAS A

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:57.982 region:rollup2

00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:00.251 region:rollup2
THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY OVERRULE

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:02.187 region:rollup2
THE DMV SO IN THE PAST WHEN THE

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:03.722 region:rollup2

THE DEALERS HOLD IT OVER THE.

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:17.202 region:rollup2
DMV'S HEAD THAT THEY CAN APPEAL

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.670 region:rollup2
TO THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD

00:37:17.202 --> 00:37:20.338 region:rollup2
AND GET THE CASES OVERTURNED.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.640 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THEY SUCCEEDED IN

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:24.509 region:rollup2
DOING THAT IN A CASE INVOLVING

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.043 region:rollup2

WE'RE CONCERNED THAT. THIS

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:48.166 region:rollup2
WOULD INCREASE HER POWER THAT

ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH.

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:22.961 region:rollup2
WE THINK SHOULD BE STRICKEN FROM

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:24.929 region:rollup2
THE BILL WE DID PROVIDE SOME

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:26.564 region:rollup2

THE EXAMPLE GIVEN IS A PRIME

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:46.551 region:rollup2

PLAGUE YOU TRY TO AVOID.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.975 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD ONES

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:18.209 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY A QUESTION FOR BOTH

00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:21.612 region:rollup2
SIDES

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:23.715 region:rollup2
AND FOR. THE IT IS THE AUTHOR OR

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:25.850 region:rollup2
EVERY TYPE TO ANSWER.

THERE'S THAT. I'M IN I'M JUST

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.886 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON

00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:30.555 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN AND OUT AFTER THE

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:33.758 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:35.093 region:rollup2
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:36.327 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS A

00:41:35.093 --> 00:41:38.262 region:rollup2
BIG CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:41.165 region:rollup2
SIDES.

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:42.667 region:rollup2
FOR NON WARRANTY ITEMS.

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:44.001 region:rollup2
WILL SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED TO THE

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:46.437 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR WARRANTY

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:49.107 region:rollup2
ITEMS.

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:50.141 region:rollup2
PERHAPS PUTTING A PRESSURE ON

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:52.643 region:rollup2
PAID DEALER SHIP TO.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:54.112 region:rollup2
TO.

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:55.646 region:rollup2
INCREASE THEIR NON WARRANTY

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:57.782 region:rollup2
RETAIL ITEM.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:59.951 region:rollup2
EITHER TO SUBSIDIZE OR

00:41:57.782 --> 00:42:01.786 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE HAVE THE REIMBURSEMENT

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:02.820 region:rollup2
RATES CONNECTED. IS THAT THE

00:42:01.786 --> 00:42:06.224 region:rollup2
CASE THAT THERE'S STILL

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.424 region:rollup2
CONNECTED AND IF SO WHY.

00:42:06.224 --> 00:42:08.326 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:09.293 region:rollup2
.

00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:11.028 region:rollup2
GREAT QUESTION.

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:13.097 region:rollup2
SIMOUN BAKER SO HERE'S HOW IT

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:14.499 region:rollup2
WORKS.

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:16.134 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT WORKS NOW IN TWENTY

00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:18.069 region:rollup2
SIX

00:42:16.134 --> 00:42:19.670 region:rollup2
STATES AS THEY COME OUT MAY LOOK

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:22.673 region:rollup2
AT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE READ

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:26.310 region:rollup2
TELL RATE IS AND EVALUATE THAT

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:28.946 region:rollup2
BASED UPON WARRANTY LIKE REPAIRS

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:31.015 region:rollup2
FOR VEHICLES. THAT NO LONGER ARE

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:33.251 region:rollup2
COVERED UNDER WARRANTY

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:35.386 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS JUST THE EXPIRED.

00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:37.155 region:rollup2
WARRANTY IT'S IF YOU HAD YOUR

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.289 region:rollup2
WATER PUMP REPLACED YOUR FIRST

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:40.758 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS YOU'D BE COVERED

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:41.359 region:rollup2
UNDER WARRANTY. BUT AFTER THREE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:42.326 region:rollup2
YEARS YOU WOULD NOT BE COVERED

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:43.728 region:rollup2
UP.

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:46.330 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE USE THAT

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:49.100 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THAT WARRANTY LIKE

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:51.335 region:rollup2
REPAIR FOR WHEN A CUSTOMER PAYS

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.371 region:rollup2
WE JUST USE THAT AND PUT IT ALL

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:55.673 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER WE.

00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:57.275 region:rollup2
TAKE A WIDE SAMPLE OF A VARIETY

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:58.976 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT REPAIR ORDERS AND

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:02.046 region:rollup2
WE USE THAT REPAIR ORDER TODAY

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:03.581 region:rollup2
AND SAY THIS IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:04.982 region:rollup2
THIS DEALER IS CHARGING FOR

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:06.684 region:rollup2
RETAIL.

00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:08.419 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OUT WE SUBMIT THAT

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:10.221 region:rollup2
TO THE AUTOMAKER IN THE

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.656 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKER HAS A PROCESS KNOWN

00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.291 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY THAT'S CONNECTED.

00:43:11.656 --> 00:43:14.592 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE.

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:16.127 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE OTHER STATES HAVE

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.229 region:rollup2
DETERMINED AND WE DETERMINE AS

00:43:16.127 --> 00:43:20.131 region:rollup2
WELL THAT IN OUR STATUTE THE

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:23.034 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE OF OUR STATUTES AS THE

00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:24.936 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKER SHALL CONSIDER.

00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:26.571 region:rollup2
OUR MAY CONSIDER.

00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:28.506 region:rollup2
MAY CONSIDER THE RETAIL RATES

00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:30.675 region:rollup2
FOR PARTS.

00:43:28.506 --> 00:43:32.410 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE SEEN

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:34.412 region:rollup2
ALMOST NO AUTO MAKER ACTUALLY

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.380 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THAT WE.

00:43:34.412 --> 00:43:38.149 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY FORTY OTHER STATES

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.818 region:rollup2
HAVE PASSED LAWS ST EACH YOU

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:42.620 region:rollup2
SHALL CONSIDER RETAIL RATES

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.154 region:rollup2
AND IN TWENTY SIX STATES COME

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.389 region:rollup2
OUT WITH THE METHODOLOGY.

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:46.224 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:48.025 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AN

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:50.695 region:rollup2
INCREASE

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:52.230 region:rollup2
AND THE PRICE ON CONSUMERS.

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:53.631 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT TWENTY SIX

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:55.233 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES WE'VE TALKED TO OUR

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.767 region:rollup2
DEALERS IN THE TWENTY SIX OTHER

00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:58.369 region:rollup2
STATES THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. AND

00:43:56.767 --> 00:44:00.571 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE THAT WOULD

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:02.039 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY IGNORE THE FACT THAT

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:03.741 region:rollup2
WE WORK IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:05.843 region:rollup2
MARKET.

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:07.245 region:rollup2
NON WARRANTY REPAIRS ARE HIGHLY

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:09.213 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE WITH THOSE

00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:10.681 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP.

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:11.849 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE YOUR MOM AND POP

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.751 region:rollup2
GUYS DOWN THE STREET WHO ARE

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:15.153 region:rollup2
COMPETING AGAINST FRANCHISE NEW

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:16.687 region:rollup2
CAR DEALERS THEY DON'T HAVE AS

00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:18.022 region:rollup2
MUCH OVERHEAD THEY DON'T HAVE

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:19.056 region:rollup2
THE SPECIALIZED TRAINING THEY

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:20.358 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE. RIGHT

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.659 region:rollup2
TECHNICIANS BUT WE ARE COMPETING

00:44:20.358 --> 00:44:22.793 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.929 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IN

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:26.931 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER STATES IS THAT RATE

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:28.933 region:rollup2
ON RETAIL HAS ACTUALLY. ROCKED

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.935 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE

00:44:28.933 --> 00:44:32.003 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DEALERS CAN BE MORE

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:33.504 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:44:32.003 --> 00:44:34.539 region:rollup2
GETTING RETAIL FROM THE

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:36.474 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKERS VERSES THEY'RE

00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:37.508 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZING.

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:39.477 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:41.145 region:rollup2
IS DOES THIS EXACTLY WHEN I

00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:42.013 region:rollup2
STOOD KNOWING THAT WAS THE NEXT

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.748 region:rollup2
QUESTION I HAD WAS IF YOU HAVE

00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:45.216 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IT'S A. WHAT THIS

00:44:43.748 --> 00:44:46.751 region:rollup2
CAN DO TO CONSUMERS?

00:44:45.216 --> 00:44:48.386 region:rollup2
IS ALSO PART MEET BASICALLY BE

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:50.054 region:rollup2
REALLY NICE IF IF THERE'S A LOT

00:44:48.386 --> 00:44:51.322 region:rollup2
MORE ANIMOSITY THAN THERE HAS

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:52.623 region:rollup2
BEEN FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:44:51.322 --> 00:44:53.624 region:rollup2
INCOME IN THE COMMITTEE AT THIS

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:55.593 region:rollup2
STAGE BE NICE IF WE DIDN'T SEE

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:57.562 region:rollup2
IT. AND THIS IS WORKED OUT BUT

00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:58.963 region:rollup2
MY ALSO TRYING TO DIGEST WHAT IS

00:44:57.562 --> 00:45:00.831 region:rollup2
GONNA HAPPEN TO CONSUMERS IN MY

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:02.867 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SO. IF I I WOULD LIKE

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:04.202 region:rollup2
TO HEAR THAT COUNTER IF YOU HAVE

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:05.970 region:rollup2
ONE IF THAT PUTS UP PRICE

00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:07.471 region:rollup2
PRESSURE.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.340 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE MUCH SHORTER.

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:10.441 region:rollup2
YES AND THE REASON I MUST IT IS

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.076 region:rollup2
BILLS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:14.111 region:rollup2
FROM PRE PREDECESSORS.

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:16.614 region:rollup2
THE BILL PROHIBITS THE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:18.316 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS.

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:20.318 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED WITH GOVERNMENT

00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:22.320 region:rollup2
INSURANCE RAINING THEY'VE PICKED

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:24.822 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST RATE IN THAT IT THAT

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.857 region:rollup2
IN THE STATUTE. AND MAKE US PAY

00:45:24.822 --> 00:45:28.192 region:rollup2
IT EVEN IF WE OBJECT WE HAVE TO

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:29.961 region:rollup2
PAY IT WHILE IT'S BEING

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:30.895 region:rollup2
LITIGATED IN FRONT OF THE NEW

00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:32.163 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:33.898 region:rollup2
A PROCESSES FOR WHICH ARE

00:45:32.163 --> 00:45:36.701 region:rollup2
DISTORTED UNDER THIS BILL.

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:39.670 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S IT'S A BAD IDEA

00:45:36.701 --> 00:45:42.073 region:rollup2
COMPOUNDED BY UNFAIRNESS.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.407 region:rollup2
NOW THE NEXT ONE HAS TO DO WITH

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:45.943 region:rollup2
THE FIRST EXAMPLE MISTER IRVINE

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:48.746 region:rollup2
HAD AYE AYE AYE AND I THUMB PAGE

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR OF THE IDEA. THAT IF

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:53.684 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WERE TO PASS.

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:55.086 region:rollup2
A FACILITY WOULD NOT BE CHANGED.

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:56.854 region:rollup2
FOR TEN YEARS THEY HAVE NO

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:58.356 region:rollup2
REASON TO DO THAT.

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:59.423 region:rollup2
YEAH I READ THROUGH THE REST OF

00:45:58.356 --> 00:46:00.091 region:rollup2
IT IN ITS UNDER CERTAIN

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.859 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THAT'S

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:04.228 region:rollup2
THE CASE.

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:05.496 region:rollup2
TO ME I'M NOT SURE IF THESE ARE

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:07.265 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS AFFECTED THIS

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.699 region:rollup2
PROVISION.

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:09.900 region:rollup2
I'M OF THE AUTHOR WANTS TO

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.801 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT AT THIS ONE STILL

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.436 region:rollup2
STAYS IN AFTER TODAY'S

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:15.106 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS.

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.173 region:rollup2
OKAY. SO THAT'S THE CASE.

00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:17.908 region:rollup2
I MEAN JUST IN FAIRNESS THE

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:19.443 region:rollup2
PARAGRAPH GOES ON.

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:20.678 region:rollup2
WITH A MUCH MORE NARROW

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:22.013 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT THERE'S

00:46:20.678 --> 00:46:23.881 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN TEN YEARS THAT'S ONLY

00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:25.049 region:rollup2
IF AS I READ IT.

00:46:23.881 --> 00:46:26.450 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR MODIFICATION IS

00:46:25.049 --> 00:46:27.918 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.387 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPLY IF YOU SILLY

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.655 region:rollup2
ALTERATION IS NECESSARY TO

00:46:29.387 --> 00:46:31.622 region:rollup2
ENABLE THE SERVICE OF THE ZERO

00:46:30.655 --> 00:46:33.391 region:rollup2
EMISSION VEHICLES SO THERE'S

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:34.659 region:rollup2
SOME NARROWING. Y. WHEN THE NEW

00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:36.193 region:rollup2
CAR DEALERS HAVE AN INCENTIVE

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:37.461 region:rollup2
YOUR ST STEEL AND ALUMINUM CAN'T

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:39.730 region:rollup2
DO IT TOGETHER DON'T THEY HAVE

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:42.066 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE. ALREADY WITHOUT

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.467 region:rollup2
THIS EVEN IF YOU'RE READING IT

00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:44.535 region:rollup2
IS NEARLY AS YOU IT PROPOSED.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.169 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS IF IT NEEDS

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:48.839 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:50.441 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS.

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:52.276 region:rollup2
I READ IT AS A DISJUNCTIVE

00:46:50.441 --> 00:46:53.544 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ELIMINATED ZERO EMISSION

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:54.979 region:rollup2
VEHICLES YOU ARE CORRECT.

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:57.314 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN ADMISSION THAT THEY

00:46:54.979 --> 00:46:59.083 region:rollup2
WERE PREVIOUSLY CAPTURED BY.

00:46:57.314 --> 00:47:01.018 region:rollup2
SO CLEARLY ANYTHING ELSE IS

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:01.886 region:rollup2
CAPTURED.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.121 region:rollup2
BY EXCLUDING ZERO EMISSION

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:06.057 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:07.158 region:rollup2
SO WE S. WOULD THEY SHOULD HAVE

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:09.060 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:47:07.158 --> 00:47:10.861 region:rollup2
RIGHT THEY SHOULD BE LEADING THE

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.229 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO DEPLOY THESE VEHICLES

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:13.764 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO RESISTING IT.

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:15.533 region:rollup2
WE INTERPRET THIS.

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:17.368 region:rollup2
READ THE TEXT

00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:19.070 region:rollup2
WE ARE RANDOM HELD THEM TO DO

00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:20.705 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE OFTEN THAN EVERY.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:22.540 region:rollup2
AND

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:24.375 region:rollup2
YEARS EXCEPT AS RELATES TO ZERO

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.077 region:rollup2
EMISSION VEHICLES

00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:28.279 region:rollup2
THE ALUMINUM EXEMPTION AND AND

00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:28.779 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:30.414 region:rollup2
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.981 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY IF WE COULD BE THE

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:34.285 region:rollup2
STANDARD INTERNAL COMBUSTION

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:36.220 region:rollup2
ENGINE.

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:38.189 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I I THINK WERE.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.790 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE KIND OF DETAILS

00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:41.692 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:43.794 region:rollup2
THIS CONTINUE THE BILL THE STAY

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.395 region:rollup2
ALIVE SO THAT YOU CAN BE DOING

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.463 region:rollup2
THIS KNOWING THAT ANYONE OF US

00:47:44.395 --> 00:47:47.131 region:rollup2
COULD.

00:47:45.463 --> 00:47:48.299 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SEE WHAT ULTIMATELY

00:47:47.131 --> 00:47:49.033 region:rollup2
COMES BEFORE US ON THE FLOOR BE

00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:49.233 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE SUPPORT

00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:51.001 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:53.204 region:rollup2
.

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:54.438 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:56.073 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WHATEVER. SCANNED THEM

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:57.541 region:rollup2
LECTURE BUT WHATEVER THE

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:58.142 region:rollup2
ANIMOSITY IS YOU HAVE THE

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.476 region:rollup2
CAPACITOR US NOT TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:58.142 --> 00:48:00.010 region:rollup2
GET SOMETHING

00:47:58.476 --> 00:48:01.045 region:rollup2
SENSIBLE TO US.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.713 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE TWO PARTICULAR

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:04.715 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:06.050 region:rollup2
ARE THAT SHOULD BE YOU CAN AGREE

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.518 region:rollup2
JUST BY LOOKING AT THE TEXT OR

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.719 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE AND DON'T SO. KEEP

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.521 region:rollup2
WORKING ON IT AND I HOPE THAT

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:12.089 region:rollup2
WILL HAPPEN AFTER TODAY. THANK

00:48:10.521 --> 00:48:13.791 region:rollup2
YOU WITHOUT A DOUBT THEY WILL.

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:16.894 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION IS GOING TO HAVE

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:19.597 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE. ON IT DID BEGAN AND

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:21.298 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THERE HASN'T BEEN LOTS

00:48:19.597 --> 00:48:22.867 region:rollup2
OF DISCUSSION THERE HAS BEEN

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:25.169 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO LET US KNOW WHICH

00:48:22.867 --> 00:48:28.172 region:rollup2
OF THE PROVISIONS WERE.

00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:29.106 region:rollup2
OBJECTIONABLE AND SO THERE WERE.

00:48:28.172 --> 00:48:32.276 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN BY

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:36.013 region:rollup2
THE DEALERS.

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:36.347 region:rollup2
MR FROM THAT I HAVE MS FREEMAN.

00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:38.416 region:rollup2
I'LL BE BRIEF.

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:39.517 region:rollup2
.

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:40.484 region:rollup2
I GUESS MY COMMENTS ARE MADE

00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:41.952 region:rollup2
DIPPED TO BOTH SIDES.

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.286 region:rollup2
I'VE I'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.587 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS.

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.955 region:rollup2
.

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:46.457 region:rollup2
I WHICHEVER FRAZIER ON THIS ON

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:48.125 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAVE HEARD

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:49.693 region:rollup2
FROM MY LOCAL DEALERSHIPS.

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:50.494 region:rollup2
A VERY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'D

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:52.463 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ALL OUR LOCAL

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:53.531 region:rollup2
DEALERSHIPS ARE SIGNIFICANT PART

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:54.632 region:rollup2
OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY.

00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:56.100 region:rollup2
THE KERN COUNTY.

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:58.335 region:rollup2
BUT CLEARLY.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.137 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:01.772 region:rollup2
AND I REMAIN AND I BELIEVE THESE

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:04.241 region:rollup2
ISSUES ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:05.543 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED BY BOTH PARTIES IN

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.744 region:rollup2
ORDER TO ENSURE THE BEST

00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:08.512 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE OUTCOME BOTH

00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:09.447 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS. AND THE

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:10.948 region:rollup2
DEALERSHIPS NEED TO WORK

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:11.782 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND LIGHT OF THE

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:12.950 region:rollup2
CHANGING ECONOMY THAT WE

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:15.319 region:rollup2
LITERALLY LIVE IN AND HOW

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.554 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED.

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.855 region:rollup2
AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD.

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:33.103 region:rollup2
SAYS REALLY TURNS FEDERATION

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.604 region:rollup2
FOLKS MENTIONED YOU TREAT IF IF

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:36.573 region:rollup2
THE IF THE LIGHT IS NOT

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.774 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.309 region:rollup2
WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:40.610 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TREATS IT AS IF I IT

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:42.612 region:rollup2
JUST A FOUR WAY STOP SIGN?

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.546 region:rollup2

THE OTHER THING YOU CAN

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:47.951 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DO. IN THIS SITUATION

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:48.785 region:rollup2
IS MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN.

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:50.220 region:rollup2
AFTER COME TO STOP MAKE A RIGHT

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:52.222 region:rollup2
HAND TURN. AND THEN SOMEHOW

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.189 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.723 region:rollup2
YOUR LEAD TO PROCEED ON YOUR

ROUTE. I'M ALSO MOTORCYCLE

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.960 region:rollup2
RIDER.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.128 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE A

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.462 region:rollup2
POSITION ON THE BILL WE DO

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:00.630 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.965 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD IN THE BILL THAT

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:04.134 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST REQUIRE SOME TO WAIT

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:04.734 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:05.969 region:rollup2
AND ECHO THE STATEMENT OF THE

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:08.271 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:09.339 region:rollup2
LOBBYIST WHAT IS A REASONABLE

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.874 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT MAKES IT

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:12.809 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT FROM FROM THE

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:13.510 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT OF ENFORCEMENT AFTER

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:15.345 region:rollup2
THE SAMPLING OF OF VEHICLE

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.980 region:rollup2
COLLISION INVESTIGATE.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:19.015 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THE POTENTIAL.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.918 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES.

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:22.485 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OUTWEIGH ANY.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:22.485 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE I THINK THAT WOULD

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.120 region:rollup2
BE ACHIEVED BY SOMETHING LIKE

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:28.091 region:rollup2
MISTER I TO POLITICS TO TRY TO

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:29.159 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THAT. ON.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:31.394 region:rollup2
YEAH IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:32.662 region:rollup2
NOT FUNCTIONING BECAUSE IN THE

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.663 region:rollup2
IN THE SCENARIO IS THERE

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:36.432 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:38.301 region:rollup2
IN THAT I'M ALLUDING TO AYE

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:40.870 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT THE GREEN ISN'T COMING

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:42.372 region:rollup2
FORWARD I TO ME THERE COULD BE A

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:45.542 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE POWER LINES ARE

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.343 region:rollup2
DOWN THE POWERS OUR RIGHTS JUST

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:49.245 region:rollup2
FLASHING REGISTERED LIKE THAT.

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:51.247 region:rollup2
IT IS IT CONSIDERED NON

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:53.249 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING IF THE GREEN ISN'T

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:54.450 region:rollup2
CYCLING THROUGH.

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.718 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE SITUATIONS WHERE

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.086 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ABOUT HOW HOW WOULD WE

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:58.221 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT AT THE TIME HOW THE

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.355 region:rollup2
MOTORCYCLES YOU KNOW THAT AT THE

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:00.523 region:rollup2
TIME AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL THE

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.758 region:rollup2
STANDARD THE BILL REASONABLE

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.194 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:05.094 region:rollup2
IS NOT THAT SAME STANDARD AS NOT

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.930 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING AND THAT'S WHERE

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:08.398 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONFUSION WOULD COME

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.998 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL MAKE THIS DIFFICULT.

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.967 region:rollup2
TO BOTH IN FORCE AND TO USE AS

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:12.635 region:rollup2
A.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:14.304 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN INVESTIGATING A

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:16.306 region:rollup2
COLLISION.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:17.373 region:rollup2
IN ON I KNOW THERE SHOULD BE A

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.642 region:rollup2
RARE SITUATION.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:21.778 region:rollup2
BUT THE SCENARIO OF TAKING A

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:23.713 region:rollup2
RIGHT HAND TURN I COULD BE VERY

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:25.281 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC INTO SITUATIONS ONE

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.850 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NO U. TURNS ALLOWED

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.885 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR QUITE SOME

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.053 region:rollup2
TIME. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BE

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:32.422 region:rollup2
TRAPPED IF THERE WASN'T BOND NO

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:33.556 region:rollup2
RIGHT TURN ON RED SUCH.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.123 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE ARE THAT'S NOT NOT

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:36.025 region:rollup2
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A PERFECT

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:37.427 region:rollup2

SOARING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.245 region:rollup2
ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S VERY

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.580 region:rollup2

I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.588 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:06.356 region:rollup2
.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.758 region:rollup2
JUST JUST TO POINT OUT WE LEFT

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:10.193 region:rollup2
THE. DEFINITION OF REASONABLE

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:12.962 region:rollup2
WITTY PRETTY VAGUE WHEN WE WROTE

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:13.129 region:rollup2

.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.867 region:rollup2
YEAH A TUNNEL DOWN ON THAT AS WE

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.602 region:rollup2
AS THE BILL WENT THROUGH THE

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.737 region:rollup2
PROCESS SORT OF INTENTIONAL BE

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.171 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:23.172 region:rollup2
IS COMPLETELY EMPIRICAL Y.

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:24.607 region:rollup2
CONCERT NUMBER CYCLES OF THE

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:27.110 region:rollup2
LIGHT. FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:28.578 region:rollup2
TIME THAT ELAPSES* BEEN DONE

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.213 region:rollup2
IN OTHER STATES OR IF.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:31.514 region:rollup2
IF THE OUTCOME IS THAT.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.249 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE AND YOU

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.584 region:rollup2
NEVER GET TO READ THAT YOU

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.785 region:rollup2
SHOULD DISMOUNT IN CROSS TWO

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:37.020 region:rollup2
LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:38.288 region:rollup2
INTERSECTION I THINK WHEN YOU

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.089 region:rollup2
LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT AND SO WE

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:41.190 region:rollup2
SHOULD CHANGE THE CODE. TO TO

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:43.393 region:rollup2
REFLECT THAT FACT AS WELL I JUST

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:44.928 region:rollup2
TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT WE EXPECTED

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.229 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION BUT I

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.230 region:rollup2
THINK YOU FOR INDULGENCE MISTER

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.131 region:rollup2
CHAIR WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.566 region:rollup2
THE BILL. LIKE YOU MISTER

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.501 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE AND I QUESTION THE

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.735 region:rollup2
LOGIC OF PROVIDING LEGAL DEFENSE

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.736 region:rollup2
FOR ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.838 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES OF THE

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:57.206 region:rollup2
ROAD. WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.875 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.743 region:rollup2
ALSO STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS TO

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.611 region:rollup2
ADDRESS ISSUE YOU HAVE RAISED

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.713 region:rollup2
THOSE LAWS WERE LIMITED TO

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:04.714 region:rollup2
BICYCLES MOTORCYCLES AND BETTER

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.516 region:rollup2
DEFINED WITH SOMEONE COULD

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:07.784 region:rollup2
RENTAL REDLIGHT.

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:09.185 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EVEN THEN SUCH LANGUAGE

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:11.387 region:rollup2
CAN MAKE IT HARDER TO PROVE RED

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:12.322 region:rollup2
LIGHT VIOLATIONS.

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:14.991 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL LOOK

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:15.658 region:rollup2
AT GOING FORWARD IS IS HOPEFULLY

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:16.793 region:rollup2
CAN WORK WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.394 region:rollup2

DRESCHER CONCERNS.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:22.632 region:rollup2
BUT FOR ME ALWAYS THE PUBLIC

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:24.601 region:rollup2
SAFETY TAKES PRECEDENCE IN ANY

01:08:22.632 --> 01:08:25.702 region:rollup2
SITUATION GOING FORWARD.

01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:27.036 region:rollup2

HE'S VEHICLES ALSO KNOWN AS AND

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:40.009 region:rollup2
TV'S ARE THE SIZE OF MOTORCYCLES

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:42.145 region:rollup2
BUT PROVIDE BETTER SAFETY

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:44.347 region:rollup2
FEATURES AND. AS THEY TEND TO BE

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:47.216 region:rollup2
POWERED BY ELECTRIC OR HYBRID

01:09:44.347 --> 01:09:48.351 region:rollup2
ENGINES ARE MORE EFFICIENT.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.852 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU

01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:51.954 region:rollup2

EVEN I COULD FIT IN ONE

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:06.069 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLY.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:07.904 region:rollup2
MY STAFF WROTE THAT I THINK

THAT WE HAVE TODAY ON THE BUILT

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:05.988 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:08.558 region:rollup2
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.759 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS ANY.

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:11.360 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU A MUCH ARE THERE ANY

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.961 region:rollup2
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.563 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:15.932 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:18.634 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE ANY OF THOSE WANT TO

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:20.503 region:rollup2
SPEAK IN OPPOSITION.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:23.639 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE EITHER ANY MEMBERS

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:25.141 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMITTEE ELECT.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.408 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR TREATMENT. I HAVE A

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:27.276 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:28.411 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:30.279 region:rollup2
COURSE VERY INTRUSIVE AND

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.147 region:rollup2
LISTENS TO CONGESTION.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:33.850 region:rollup2
AS I REPRESENT LOS ANGELES.

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:36.219 region:rollup2
YES.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.320 region:rollup2
ALSO UP I AM VERY INTERESTED IN

01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:39.121 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS A CONGESTION LIVING IN

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.823 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES.

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:42.758 region:rollup2
BUT GIVEN THAT THE THERE'S NO

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:43.326 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO ALLOW SEVERAL OF

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:45.461 region:rollup2
THESE VEHICLES TO SHARE THE

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:46.963 region:rollup2
LANE.

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.965 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL WRITING.

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:50.933 region:rollup2
ONE BY ONE.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.268 region:rollup2
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.669 region:rollup2
HELPS WITH THE CONGESTION ISSUE

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:55.238 region:rollup2
I CAN SEE HOW WOULD MIGHT HELP

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:56.739 region:rollup2
WITH THE PARKING ISSUE. BUT IN

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:58.341 region:rollup2
TERMS OF ROAD CONGESTION IF YOU

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:59.742 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE TO HAVE THEM ONE CAR

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.810 region:rollup2
AFTER ANOTHER.

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:02.912 region:rollup2
AND SINCE THEY DON'T THEY HOLD

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:03.679 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:06.382 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.882 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CREATING MORE SPACE

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.917 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED FOR THESE

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:09.852 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:11.354 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TRYING TO HAVE

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:13.990 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THAT LIKE BUSES THAT

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:15.725 region:rollup2
CARRY A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.926 region:rollup2
SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT. I'M

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.394 region:rollup2
SURE PLUS FUND HAS WANT TO

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.795 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THAT LET ME JUST SAY

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.430 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ANOTHER

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:22.565 region:rollup2
OPTION FOR MOTORISTS

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:24.166 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN LARGE.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
SUV'S

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:28.204 region:rollup2
AND AND AND BIGGER VEHICLES AND

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:30.006 region:rollup2
LIKE THE QUESTION AROUND. A LANE

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:30.273 region:rollup2
SPLITTING WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:32.775 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:34.443 region:rollup2
CHP ON THAT QUESTION AND WE'RE

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:36.012 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE DEFERRED THE CHP ON

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.647 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY PIECE BUT THAT IS A

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:39.048 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF AN OF AN OPEN

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:40.650 region:rollup2
ISSUE BUT I'M GONNA LET MISTER

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.751 region:rollup2
POINT HAS COMMENT IF YOU WELL.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.286 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:44.420 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN FOR THE QUESTION SO THE

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:46.255 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS I THINK DOES A VERY

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.456 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB IN HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.025 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES OF THE BUILT

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:50.559 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT DID SUGGEST THAT

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:51.961 region:rollup2
SOME POINT. WE MAY HAVE TO RE

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:54.263 region:rollup2
STRIKE FREEWAYS I THINK THE

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:55.398 region:rollup2
REALITY IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.599 region:rollup2
GOING TO SEE ANY LARGER OR MORE

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:57.833 region:rollup2
CAPACITY BUILT IN THE

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.468 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THE QUESTION

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:02.538 region:rollup2
BECOMES. HOW WAS IT THAT WE GET

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:03.272 region:rollup2
TO SOLUTIONS WHERE WE MAXIMIZE

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:05.341 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:07.143 region:rollup2
BILLS? THESE VEHICLES I MENTION

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:08.611 region:rollup2
ARE NO WIDER THAN FORTY INCHES

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:11.047 region:rollup2
AND THE CASE OF THE SHORT TRACK

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:11.881 region:rollup2
VEHICLE NO LONGER THAN A HUNDRED

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:12.982 region:rollup2
AND TWO INCHES.

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:14.517 region:rollup2
SO EVEN AGAINST MY LEAF THIS

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:15.885 region:rollup2
VEHICLE IS A LITTLE BIT SMALLER

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:17.386 region:rollup2
THAN THE ONE THAT I CURRENTLY

01:14:15.885 --> 01:14:19.188 region:rollup2
DRIVE SO THERE WILL BE SOME

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:21.757 region:rollup2
NATURAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:23.292 region:rollup2
VEHICLES TO TAKE. MORE OF THE

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:25.828 region:rollup2
BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND ACTUALLY

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:27.096 region:rollup2
GET MORE RIDERS IN PLACE.

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.730 region:rollup2
BUT THE REALITY OF THE MATTER IS

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:32.234 region:rollup2
THAT THESE VEHICLES FOR THEM TO

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:33.736 region:rollup2
BE IN PRODUCTION

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:35.938 region:rollup2
THE NEAR FUTURE THIS IS PROBABLY

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:37.907 region:rollup2
THREE TO FIVE MAYBE EVEN EIGHT

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:39.675 region:rollup2
YOU'RE A VENTURE BEFORE WE SEE

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:40.710 region:rollup2
THESE COME TO SCALE. AT THAT

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.545 region:rollup2
POINT I THINK YOU'LL SEE

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.313 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES LIKE AUTONOMOUS

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:45.881 region:rollup2
VEHICLES AND THE ABILITY FOR

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.683 region:rollup2
THESE VEHICLES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.385 region:rollup2
OF THOSE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:51.354 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THEY'LL JIGSAW THEM

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:53.689 region:rollup2
WAY THEIR WAY BACK INTO A WAY

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:54.423 region:rollup2
WHERE WILL MAXIMIZE. WHAT IS

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:56.392 region:rollup2
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE BUILT

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:58.794 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:59.695 region:rollup2
PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:01.230 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SOMETHING OTHER THAN

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:03.099 region:rollup2
WHAT IS CURRENTLY THE ISSUE

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.567 region:rollup2
WHICH IS? MULTI PASSENGER

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:04.800 region:rollup2
VEHICLES WHERE YOU JUST SEE ONE

01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:06.736 region:rollup2
PERSON.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.304 region:rollup2
DRIVING.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:09.505 region:rollup2
WELL I UNDERSTAND IN THE IN THE

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.073 region:rollup2
FUTURE WHEN WE'RE ALL DRIVING

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.708 region:rollup2
THESE IF YOU HAVE LANE SITTERS

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:13.843 region:rollup2
REESE RIGHT FOR THEM. THEN I

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:15.277 region:rollup2
COULD SEE THEM MAKING A

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.245 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE FOR CONGESTION AND I

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:17.680 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:19.749 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WRITING IN THEM AS LONG

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.750 region:rollup2
AS THEY'RE SAFE. BUT TO THEN SAY

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:22.551 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO UC

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.919 region:rollup2
HOV LANE WHEN THEY'RE ONLY

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:25.654 region:rollup2
CARRYING ONE PERSON IN THERE.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:26.455 region:rollup2
NOT REDUCING CONGESTION BECAUSE

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:28.424 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL HAVE TO BE THE

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:29.825 region:rollup2
SAME.

01:15:28.424 --> 01:15:30.826 region:rollup2
LINK BETWEEN VEHICLES THAT DOES

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.094 region:rollup2
THAT PART DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:33.529 region:rollup2
TO ME.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:35.364 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:37.333 region:rollup2
I HAVE RIGHT NOW SURE AND AND

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:38.834 region:rollup2
THE I THINK AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR

01:15:37.333 --> 01:15:40.870 region:rollup2
FOR THE ANALYSIS I THINK THE

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:42.405 region:rollup2
BILL POINTS OUT TO A PIECE OF

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.173 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY MYSELF

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:45.975 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY HAD THREE WHEELED

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:47.209 region:rollup2
FULLY ENCLOSED VEHICLES TO BE

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.210 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.745 region:rollup2
TOBY LANE.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.247 region:rollup2
AND THESE VEHICLES HE ONE

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:53.416 region:rollup2
QUESTION THEY ASK IS HOW MANY

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:54.283 region:rollup2
PASSENGERS WERE THE ONES THAT

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.351 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THAT ARE BEING BETA

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:57.553 region:rollup2
TESTED WHETHER IT'S FROM ALPHA

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:59.188 region:rollup2
MORT MOTORS. OR FROM NISSAN ARE

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.489 region:rollup2
FROM TOYOTA OR FROM COMMUTER

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:02.758 region:rollup2
CARS IS THAT YOU HAVE.

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:07.430 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TWO

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:08.097 region:rollup2
PASSENGERS PER VEHICLE.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.631 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:11.033 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:16.172 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:16.705 region:rollup2
AS HE NUMBER OF PROJECTS CLOSE.

01:16:16.172 --> 01:16:18.808 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THOSE QUICKER I

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:22.044 region:rollup2

02:03:24.631 --> 02:03:27.166 region:rollup2
WORKING RIGHT THE MILES PER

02:03:25.198 --> 02:03:30.770 region:rollup2
HOUR.

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:31.404 region:rollup2
INCREASE HAS GONE VERY WELL P.

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:33.840 region:rollup2
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT

02:03:31.404 --> 02:03:34.173 region:rollup2
MORE BY A. DIFFERENT STORY WAS

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.409 region:rollup2
SIXTY EIGHTY.

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:38.177 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY TOOK AN EXISTING LANE

02:03:36.409 --> 02:03:39.245 region:rollup2
AND MADE IT A HOT LANE AND

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:40.914 region:rollup2
AREN'T EXPANDING.

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:42.916 region:rollup2
MORE LANES AND.

02:03:40.914 --> 02:03:43.783 region:rollup2
HAS I MEAN BURST IT'S FAIRLY

02:03:42.916 --> 02:03:45.685 region:rollup2
YOUNG I THINK IT STARTED IN

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:46.352 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER.

02:03:45.685 --> 02:03:49.155 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE EVEN THE FIRST OF THIS

02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:51.190 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT IT'S IT'S DRAMATICALLY

02:03:49.155 --> 02:03:53.293 region:rollup2
LESS POPULAR AND WHERE. WE HAVE

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:54.627 region:rollup2
SEEN MUCH LESS HAVE MILES PER

02:03:53.293 --> 02:03:56.095 region:rollup2
HOUR. MOVEMENT AT LEAST FROM

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:57.063 region:rollup2
JUST

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:58.464 region:rollup2
CASUAL OBSERVATION THOUGH IT

02:03:57.063 --> 02:04:00.400 region:rollup2
SEEMS MORE DATA ON IT HAVE YOU

02:03:58.464 --> 02:04:02.735 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE COMPARISON.

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.936 region:rollup2
AND WHY NOT ADD ONLY.

02:04:02.735 --> 02:04:05.638 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF UP SOONER BAKER YES WE

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:07.206 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:09.208 region:rollup2
BOTH CONVERTING ELAINE AND

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:09.842 region:rollup2
EXPANDING OUR CALLING THE

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:11.544 region:rollup2
PAUCITY THROUGH RESTRICTING THE

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:13.079 region:rollup2
SHOULDER. PARTICULARLY THE NORTH

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:14.781 region:rollup2
BOUND ONTO EIGHTY WE HAVE THAT

02:04:13.079 --> 02:04:16.482 region:rollup2
EXTRA SHOULDER LANE SO WE HAVE

02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:17.884 region:rollup2
BOTH. TYPES OF DESIGNS IN OUR

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:19.519 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUAL STUDIES AT THE MOMENT

02:04:17.884 --> 02:04:21.688 region:rollup2
CALTRANS IS ALSO REQUESTED THAT

02:04:19.519 --> 02:04:22.488 region:rollup2
WE EXAMINED A FLYOVER RAMP

02:04:21.688 --> 02:04:23.523 region:rollup2
BUILDING A WHOLE NEW RAMP

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:25.124 region:rollup2
CONNECTING DIRECTLY FROM ONE A

02:04:23.523 --> 02:04:26.959 region:rollup2
ONE TO TWO EIGHTY. THAT WILL BE

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:28.494 region:rollup2
IN OUR NEXT PHASE OF STUDY WITH

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:31.364 region:rollup2
CALTRANS AT THEIR REQUEST.

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:32.265 region:rollup2
AND WHERE OF ALTON NEXT WENT

02:04:31.364 --> 02:04:33.766 region:rollup2
CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHERE THE

02:04:32.265 --> 02:04:35.735 region:rollup2
DOLLARS GO USE MARKETER ANY PAIN

02:04:33.766 --> 02:04:37.537 region:rollup2
AND I SEE FROM THE LANGUAGE FOR

02:04:35.735 --> 02:04:38.871 region:rollup2
TRANSIT WILL IT GO TO ROAD

02:04:37.537 --> 02:04:40.907 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:04:38.871 --> 02:04:42.308 region:rollup2
FINDING RETURN TO SOURCE ON THAT

02:04:40.907 --> 02:04:43.910 region:rollup2
ROAD WAY OF EXPANDING. SOME

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:45.111 region:rollup2
IRREGULAR THE IDEA IS YES TO

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:45.678 region:rollup2
KEEP THE FUNDS RATE IN THE

02:04:45.111 --> 02:04:46.346 region:rollup2
QUARTER IN WHICH THEY ARE

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:47.413 region:rollup2
COLLECTED.

02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:48.748 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF THE

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:50.516 region:rollup2
OTHER COOPER QUARTERS IN THE BAY

02:04:48.748 --> 02:04:51.651 region:rollup2
AREA TERMS OF ROAD MAINTENANCE

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:53.353 region:rollup2
AND OPERATION OF FORCE BUT THOSE

02:04:51.651 --> 02:04:54.887 region:rollup2
ARE THE FIRST CALLS. I WE'VE

02:04:53.353 --> 02:04:57.190 region:rollup2
TRANSIT AS WELL IN THE QUARTER

02:04:54.887 --> 02:04:57.724 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO REINVEST

02:04:57.190 --> 02:04:58.524 region:rollup2

THAT YOU'RE HAVING A DISTRICT

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:05.231 region:rollup2
THAT HAS SEEN SO MUCH CHANGE

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:07.934 region:rollup2
WITH HOT PLANES FROM EACH OF THE

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:08.568 region:rollup2
LANES AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD ON

02:05:07.934 --> 02:05:10.703 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO MAY NOT LIVE IN THE

02:05:08.568 --> 02:05:12.638 region:rollup2
AREA. BUT ARE AFFECTED BY THE

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:13.940 region:rollup2
COMMUTE TRAFFIC I'M I'M HESITANT

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:16.109 region:rollup2
ON WHEN THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A

02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:18.177 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT ALL OTHER

02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:18.711 region:rollup2

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:19.779 region:rollup2
TO THE C. T. SEEING AT THE

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:21.114 region:rollup2

BUT I I FEEL THAT THAT PROCESS

02:05:25.418 --> 02:05:28.488 region:rollup2
IS ONE THAT ALLOWS ALL THESE

02:05:26.786 --> 02:05:30.256 region:rollup2
ISSUES TO BE LOOKED AT BY THE

02:05:28.488 --> 02:05:31.591 region:rollup2

AREA STAND STATE ON ON THE

02:19:08.674 --> 02:19:11.176 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES THIS COULD BE

02:19:09.575 --> 02:19:12.578 region:rollup2
GREAT BUT THOSE ARE RELATIVELY

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:14.379 region:rollup2
WIDE OPEN SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE

02:19:12.578 --> 02:19:15.414 region:rollup2
ONE SET OF RULES FOR US. AND WE

02:19:14.379 --> 02:19:17.082 region:rollup2

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:04.463 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD TRY COMMUNITIES

02:20:02.895 --> 02:20:06.365 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING. MAYBE

02:20:04.463 --> 02:20:07.432 region:rollup2
EIGHT TO TEN MILES NOT JUST TO

02:20:06.365 --> 02:20:09.334 region:rollup2
GIVE ME A SHOT.

02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:11.036 region:rollup2
UMPIRE SUPPORT NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:12.504 region:rollup2
IS NO DEPTH. TO IS ABOUT IT I

02:20:11.036 --> 02:20:14.373 region:rollup2
REALLY SUPPORT YOU WORKING.

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:15.574 region:rollup2
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL

02:20:14.373 --> 02:20:17.876 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS.

02:20:15.574 --> 02:20:18.677 region:rollup2
BICU I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:19.244 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OVERSIGHT

02:20:18.677 --> 02:20:20.646 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY I THINK YOU SAID

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:22.214 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT'S.

02:20:20.646 --> 02:20:22.948 region:rollup2
EACH COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT

02:20:22.214 --> 02:20:24.349 region:rollup2
AND.

02:20:22.948 --> 02:20:25.951 region:rollup2
MAY WORK IN SOME MAY NOT WORK

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:26.752 region:rollup2
IN OTHERS BUT THE NUMBER ONE

02:20:25.951 --> 02:20:28.020 region:rollup2
THING IS THAT NOW THEY'RE

02:20:26.752 --> 02:20:29.221 region:rollup2
BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES I

02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:30.789 region:rollup2
THINK THAT MORE AND MORE THAT WE

02:20:29.221 --> 02:20:32.291 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORK AS PARTNERSHIPS.

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:34.793 region:rollup2
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

02:20:32.291 --> 02:20:36.328 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES WORK I DID TO HEAR

02:20:34.793 --> 02:20:38.764 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY FOR THE OPPOSITION

02:20:36.328 --> 02:20:41.033 region:rollup2
I TRULY UNDERSTAND. I THINK WE

02:20:38.764 --> 02:20:41.667 region:rollup2
GREAT JUSTICE MAYBE INITIALLY TO

02:20:41.033 --> 02:20:42.467 region:rollup2
GET THESE OUT TO SEE HOW THEY

02:20:41.667 --> 02:20:44.236 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:20:42.467 --> 02:20:46.071 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYBODY RESPECTS

02:20:44.236 --> 02:20:47.072 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY RIGHT AND THEY DON'T

02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:48.840 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES

02:20:47.072 --> 02:20:49.675 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WOULD

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:51.476 region:rollup2
BE WITH THIS.

02:20:49.675 --> 02:20:52.744 region:rollup2

THAT THE RECIPE FOR SAFE STREETS

02:32:15.693 --> 02:32:18.463 region:rollup2
REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:19.964 region:rollup2

OCCURRING AND ITS SEVERITY.

02:32:30.641 --> 02:32:33.578 region:rollup2
THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION

BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT LAW.

02:32:56.868 --> 02:33:00.638 region:rollup2
LET ME REPEAT THAT BECAUSE OF

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:02.073 region:rollup2
STATE LAW LOS ANGELES HAD TO

02:33:00.638 --> 02:33:03.875 region:rollup2
RAISE SPEED LIMITS ON NINETY

02:33:02.073 --> 02:33:05.743 region:rollup2
FOUR MILES OF OUR MOST DANGEROUS

02:33:03.875 --> 02:33:07.612 region:rollup2

02:33:05.743 --> 02:33:08.146 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO CHANGE

02:33:07.612 --> 02:33:10.515 region:rollup2

SETTING SPEEDS FOR SAFETY IS AN

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:14.852 region:rollup2
EXISTING PRACTICE STATE LAW

02:33:21.626 --> 02:33:24.962 region:rollup2
FOR SAFETY. NONE OF THESE

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:26.064 region:rollup2
REQUIRE SPEED SURVEYS OR EVEN

02:33:24.962 --> 02:33:27.665 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE EIGHTY FIFTH

02:33:26.064 --> 02:33:30.802 region:rollup2
PERCENTILE. THEY SIMPLY

02:33:27.665 --> 02:33:32.236 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE AND PRIORITIZE SAFETY.

02:33:30.802 --> 02:33:34.072 region:rollup2

EXTEND TO ALL TYPES OF STREETS.

02:33:34.072 --> 02:33:36.441 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO TALK FOR A MOMENT

PARTLY IT'S.

02:34:09.674 --> 02:34:12.343 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE NEED MORE LATITUDE

ADDRESS OUR SAFETY NEEDS.

02:34:22.754 --> 02:34:26.324 region:rollup2

THE PROBLEM WITH THE EIGHTY
