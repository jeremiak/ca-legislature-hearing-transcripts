00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.491
AN EXPERT WITNESS ON MANY OF THE

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:27.692
VERY CASES THAT YOU ALL ARE

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.494
TALKING ABOUT- THAT HAVE

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.128
RESULTED IN BAD OUTCOMES AT

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:32.630
TREATMENT FACILITIES. SO I'M

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.732
VERY VERY AWARE OF MANY OF THE

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.000
ISSUES I'VE ALSO SERVED AS A

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.602
MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT PRETTY MUCH

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:40.838
EVERY LEVEL OF A SAM CRITERIA OR

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.206
A SAM LEVELS OF CARE I SHOULD

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.908
SAY- WHICH WHICH MEANS

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:48.913
OUTPATIENT ALL THE WAY. TO A

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.714
HOSPITAL BASED DETOX. AS A

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.481
NATION COULD TO GROW. WITH THE

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:52.250
CON. OF STUFF SUBSTANCE USE

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.885
DISORDERS LIKE OPIOID USE. THE

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:56.254
STATISTICS DO CONTINUE TO BECOME

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.255
MORE ALARMING AS ALREADY

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:59.323
MENTIONED. RECENTLY THE CDC

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.058
ANNOUNCE THAT WE EXCEEDED A

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:01.859
HUNDRED THOUSAND DRUG OVERDOSE

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:03.928
DEATHS. NATIONALLY AND

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.564
CALIFORNIA BETWEEN APRIL TWO

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.398
THOUSAND TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:10.167
TWENTY ONE. I HAVE EXCEEDED TEN

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:10.768
THOUSAND OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.603
WERE REPORTED. THAT REPRESENTED

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.672
A FORTY THREE POINT 8% INCREASE

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.409
OR AT 840% APA PERCENT CHANGE

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:18.943
OVER THE CURRENT THE PRIOR

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.411
PERIOD. FROM A SUBSTANCE

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.113
PERSPECTIVE THE DRIVER APPEARS

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:23.347
TO BE RELATED TO SYNTHETIC

00:36:23.414 --> 00:36:25.283
OPIOIDS LIKE FENTANYL. AND

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.951
WORKED SWIFTLY MOVING INTO THE

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:29.020
FOURTH WAVE OF THE OPIOID

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.922
EPIDEMIC THAT INVOLVES BOTH

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:33.157
FENTANYL AND CYCLE STIMULANTS

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.092
LIKE METHAMPHETAMINE. SO WERE

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:35.860
RUSHING TO ADAPT TO WHAT IS

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:38.829
EVOLVING. BEFORE OUR VERY EYES.

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:39.897
THE PATIENTS AND THE FAMILIES

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.700
THAT I SERVE ALONE ARE NO MATCH

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.368
FOR THE COMPLEXITIES OF

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:46.103
ACCESSING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.772
TREATMENT IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.541
SAME HOLDS FOR OUR STATE. IT'S

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:51.909
DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER THE MAZE

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:53.444
THAT IS ADDICTION TREATMENT

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.745
MATCHING APPROPRIATE SERVICES

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.480
WITH NEED ARE DIFFICULT ENOUGH

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.082
OUR TREATMENT SYSTEM LEAVES MUCH

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.183
TO BE DESIRED FOR PROVIDING

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.618
TRANSPARENCY AND FOCUS ON

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:03.387
QUALITY OF CARE. AND ALSO JUST

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:04.989
BEING ABLE TO SORT OUT WHAT IS

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:05.957
TREATMENT VERSUS WHAT IS

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:07.858
RECOVERY SERVICES THOSE LINES

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:09.727
CAN OFTEN BE BLURRED AND THEY

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:10.595
WHEN THEY DO GET BLURRED THEY

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.096
OFTEN RESULT IN SOMEBODY

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.232
ACCESSING. INADEQUATE SERVICES.

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.335
FRANKLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.003
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING JUST TRY TO

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.271
GOOGLE IT YOURSELF IT'S OFTEN

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:21.539
THE FIRST WAY THAT MANY OF THE

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.474
FAMILIES THAT THAT I DEAL WITH

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.042
FIRST ENGAGE WITH THE SYSTEM

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.878
ONCE THEY FIND OUT WHAT A LOVED

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:28.479
ONE FOR EXAMPLE THAT HAS. THE

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.114
DISEASE OF ADDICTION. AND WE

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:31.482
KNOW ADDICTION IS A BRAIN

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.484
DISEASE WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:35.620
IT'S COUCHED IN AN AMALGAMATION

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:36.954
OF VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS LIKE

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.723
SOCIETAL FACTORS WE STILL HAVE

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:41.125
STIGMA STIGMA STILL KILLS. AND

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.560
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER BARRIERS

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:43.861
AROUND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.796
HEALTH. WE HAVE ISSUES AROUND

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.264
THE MEDICAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.799

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:01.412
SYSTEM SETS OFTEN DEPENDS ON

00:38:01.479 --> 00:38:03.147
WHAT IS EMPHASIZED AT A TIME.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:06.050
AND A MOMENT OF CRISIS. WHICH IS

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.754
THE WORST TIME. TENTH WE STILL

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.257
REMAIN SILO TO. AND OFTEN IT'S

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.493
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NOT TO

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.244
CENTER AND THEY SAY THAT THEY

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.979
PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SERVICES.

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.247
THERE'S NO STANDARDIZATION TO

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:58.681
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.517
IN PARTICULARLY FOR EXAMPLE IN

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.418
THE USE OF MEDICATIONS- THAT'S

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:03.720
IT THAT'S IT THAT'S A BIG ONE SO

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:04.988
THERE ARE STILL FACILITIES OUT

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:07.490
THERE THAT- THEY MAY HAVE THEIR

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.325
OWN PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH TO

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.661
STEW AT THE CHARACTER OF FOLKS

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.530
WITH. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.498
AND- AND BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.666
NECESSARILY IN THE MEDICAL

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:17.967
SYSTEM THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:19.068
TO GO TO THE SIR THE

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:21.304
CERTIFICATION HOWEVER. THEY'RE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:22.372
STILL TAKING CARE OF THE SAME

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.040
PEOPLE IN TERMS OF HUMAN BEINGS

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.608
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE I MEAN THE

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:28.144
PAYER IS JUST PAYER SYSTEM- AND

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.479
SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.647
THAT THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:31.748
DIFFERENCE THERE AND THEY YOU

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.317
KNOW. IT IT'S HOW WE ALSO KNOW

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.485
WHETHER SOMEBODY'S COMING IN

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.854
AND- THEY'RE USING MEDICATIONS

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:38.955
ARE NOT USING MEDICATIONS WHAT

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:40.323
YOU CAN IMAGINE GOING THROUGH

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.425
WITHDRAWAL AND IN ONE PROGRAM

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:43.993
YOU WOULD JUST BE YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.296
HANDED A BOOK AND ASKED TO JUST

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:48.031
KIND OF GO THROUGH IT. WITH

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:49.499
MEANT WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:51.534
THE TYPE OF ASSESSMENTS THAT

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:53.469
WOULD NECESSITATE ARE LOOKING

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:54.838
INTO YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY TO

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:55.538
KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE EVEN

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:57.207
APPROPRIATE TO BE THERE IF YOU

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.342
HAVE CO MORBID CONDITIONS- AND

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.377
THEN AND THEN ANOTHER GROUP WOOD

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.912
BUT- RIGHT NOW ONLY BECAUSE OF A

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:05.648
PAIR. SO THOSE KIND OF THINGS

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:08.051
NEED TO BE ALIGNED FOR SURE- AND

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:09.419
THERE NEEDS TO BE NOT JUST AN

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:12.255
OPTION TO BE. TO BE. SOMEBODY

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:14.390
THAT DOES PROVIDE CARE THAT'S IT

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.326
THAT THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED- SO

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:17.894
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THAT IS

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.028
ONE MAIN ONE AND THEN THE OTHER

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.496
ASPECT IS THE TRANSPARENCY SO

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:21.631
THAT. THE FOLKS THAT ARE

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.499
ENGAGING IN SERVICES AT ANY ONE

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:28.771
OFTHESE IT SHOULD BE SIMPLER.

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:29.339
TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:30.874
GETTING. SO THE IF EUROPE.

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.941
YOU'RE SENDING YOUR CHILD. YOU

00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:33.409
THINK MIGHT HAVE A MEDICAL ISSUE

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:34.377
MAYBE THEY HAD A SEIZURE IN THE

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.579
PAST. AND YOU DON'T RUN THE RISK

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:38.948
OF THEM GOING TO A PLACE. TO

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:41.150
DETOX OR- EVEN JUST BEING THERE

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.919
WITHOUT A DETOX. WITHOUT

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.520
APPROPRIATE. APPROPRIATELY

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:47.657
TRAINED INDIVIDUALS. AND ARE

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:48.558
PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE SUCH

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.193
THINGS. NOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.394
WE RUN INTO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:52.629
A LOT OF THE MOM AND DAD THAT

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:53.863
ARE GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.665
THAT. THEIR CHILD IS NO LONGER.

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.834
IS OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF THAT AS

00:58:57.901 --> 00:58:59.402
WELL AS EXPECTATIONS AROUND

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:01.037
STOPPING WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.305
LEAVE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE OR

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:03.873
AGAINST. CLINICAL ADVICE WHICH

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.942
HAPPENS AS WELL. IF PEOPLE.

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:08.611
DON'T HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS- IT

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:09.979
TREATED IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:11.881
WITHDRAWAL AMELIORATED WELL THEN

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:14.183
THEY GET UP AND GO. AND THAT AND

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.654
THEN AND SO WITH THE EXPECTATION

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.254
AROUND THAT WELL RIGHT NOW WE

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:20.290
DON'T HAVE. WE GET WE HAVEN'T.

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:21.691
GATHERED THAT UP AND SAID YOU

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.825
KNOW WHAT IT IS AN EXPECTATION

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.160
THAT IF EVEN IF SOMEBODY WANTS

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:24.961
TO LEAVE AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:26.963
IT IS STILL YOUR DUTY. TO TRY TO

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.064
PROTECT AND THE SAFETY OF THAT

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:30.133
INDIVIDUAL AND THE AND THEN

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:31.334
THERE SHOULD BE SOME STEPS.

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.802
OTHER OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.804
PEOPLE LEAVE AND THEN THEY DIE.

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:35.672
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING OUT INTO

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:38.207
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT A

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:40.576
QUICK FOR THE PROBABLY UNSTABLE

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:43.880

TRAGEDIES LIKE THE DEATH OF A

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:36.591
TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD. MR LEHRER

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:37.759
FROM HAPPENING. ALL OF US I

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:38.526
THINK IT'S VERY IN. BECAUSE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:41.396
WE'VE DONE WANT BE HEADING OUT

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:43.999
BURKE AT THE- ALL OF THAT. HAVE

01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:46.334
HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STRUGGLE

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:48.970
WITH ADDICTION IT'S SO COMMON IN

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.239
AMERICA AND IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.074
THAT IT'S HARD TO KNOW SOMEONE

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:55.277
WHO HASN'T HAD A FAMILY MEMBER.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.112
WHO HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THAT

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.681
SYSTEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE WE TAKE

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.149
VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE WANT TO

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:03.985
ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:06.388
TO STATE SPACE. AND MEDICALLY

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.490
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT I THINK

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.991
THAT'S THE KEY MEDICALLY

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.960
APPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.029
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND-

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.497
RESPONSES THAT WE HEARD HERE

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:18.466
ALREADY. I BELIEVE THAT CONTRARY

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.935
TO STATEMENTS BY DIRECTOR BACK

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:26.041
SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE REGULATED

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.208
IN SOME CITY. THE CITY OF CUSTOM

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.477
MADE AS AN EXAM AND THE COUNTY

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:33.081
ORANGE. AB REGULATORY ORDINANCES

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:36.918
THAT REGULATE- SOBER LIVING HOME

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.787
. AND THEY HAVE BEEN DETERMINED

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.889
TO BE LEGAL IN SEPTEMBER THE

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.724
NINTH CIRCUIT UPHELD A JURY

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.326
VERDICT THAT THE ORDINANCE FOR

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.927
COSTA MESA WAS NON

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.996
DISCRIMINATORY LATER THE COUNTY

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.698
OF ORANGE I THOUGHT DID A

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.533
SIMILAR ORDINANCE. THE

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:53.001
PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:55.437
REQUIRE COMMONSENSE PRACTICES

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:56.705
INCLUDING DISPENSING

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:59.874
REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN FACILITIES

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.743
TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION AND

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.311
THE REQUIREMENT THAT OPERATORS

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.914
TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO A SHELTER

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.316
OR BACK HOME AMONG OTHER

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:09.918
PROVISIONS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:13.555
AND SAFETY OF THOSE IN RECOVERY

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:14.823
. ONE OF THE REASONS JUST TO

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.891
REQUIRE A TRANSPORT AND

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.960
NOTIFICATION IF PEOPLE ARE TO

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:21.229
LEAVE IS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:23.231
WANDERING AROUND AND POSSIBLY

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.966
GOING INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.836
PRIVATE RESIDENTS IT. IT'S ALSO

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:28.903
TO PROTECT THEM FROM BECOMING

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:31.573
HOMELESS. ONE I'M LICENSED

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.141
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THESE

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:36.144
REGULATIONS THE CITY HAS FILED

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.579
NUISANCE ABATEMENT CLAIMS TO

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:40.515
SHUT DOWN UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:43.318
ENFORCEMENT AS IS KEEN AND IT'S

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:46.755
WORKING. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.657
CAN'T THE H. P. S. SUPPORT

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:53.361
SIMILAR STATEWIDE REGULATIONS.

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:57.132
MOSTLY HOME HAVE BEEN CONVERTED

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:06.408
THEY'RE NOT LIKE REGULAR

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:08.309

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.345
INTERACT WITH THE RESIDENTIAL

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:14.215

TOGETHER HOLIDAY PARTIES PICNIC

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:27.862
AT THAT TRACK THEY'RE REALLY

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.331
THERE FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.234
THERE'S BEEN ONGOING ROTATION IN

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:36.404

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.043

SAFETY OF THOSE IN THE TOP. I

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.858
APPRECIATED HER RESPONSE TO MY

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:59.194

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:15.443

EXISTING RULES THAT RELATE TO

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:54.268
TRAINING AT THE VERY. WHY

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:57.572
DOESN'T THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRE

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:59.974
PROFESSIONAL LICENSING AND

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.382
. THE FAILURE OF THE FACILITY TO

COMPLY WITH EVEN THE MOST BASIC

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:11.486

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:13.121
ABOUT THE LEVEL OF MEANINGFUL

LIKE A FIX IT TICKET. AND GUESS

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.673
WHAT AT SOME POINT. THE BLOOD OF

01:51:39.692 --> 01:51:42.429
SPECIFIC WALK- I CAN NAME BY TWO

01:51:42.495 --> 01:51:44.164
DIFFERENT LAWS- THAT WE DON'T

01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:46.966
HAVE HERE WITHIN OUR STATE

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:47.500
RESOURCES IN THE STATE OF

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:50.070
CALIFORNIA- AND I WOULD JUST BE

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.604
THE STATUTES BUT THAT THE

01:51:51.671 --> 01:51:53.640
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS AN

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:56.276

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:16.763
ESSENTIALLY. EACH ONE OF THOSE

DO IS. MAKE THE LONG SPECIFIC

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:24.304
TO- FILING CHARGES. AGAINST

PAYING EVERY. EACH ONE OF THOSE

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:32.879
ARE THE WAY THEY'RE WRITTEN ARE

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:38.852
STREAMLINE- EIGHT THE PROBLEM-

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:42.789
OF- AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:44.157
ORDINANCES WE HAVE HERE IN THE

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:46.025
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WORKS

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:49.062
WERE BROAD BASED- AND DEAD

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:53.066
DIFFICULT TO BOTH PROSECUTE AND-

01:52:53.133 --> 01:52:57.170
I GATHER EVIDENCE ON. SO THAT'S

01:52:57.237 --> 01:53:00.340
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL SERVE I IT.

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:01.174
JUST MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.675
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE

01:53:02.742 --> 01:53:05.278
PIECES OF LEGISLATION ONE

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:07.947
AUTHORED BY FIVE. THEN ASSEMBLY

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:09.916
MEMBER AT THAT- THEN SENATOR NOW

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:11.885
IT AT COMMISSIONER LARA I

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.419
BELIEVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:15.188
THEN I DID A FOLLOW UP PIECE OF

01:53:15.255 --> 01:53:16.990
LEGISLATION AS WILD RELATED TO

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:19.626
TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:21.694
KICKBACKS IN THIS INDUSTRY. IS

01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:24.130
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:25.231
EITHER HAVE NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.499
OR- THERE'S ADDITIONAL

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:28.601
SPECIFICITY NEEDED SO THAT YOU

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.637
AND- OTHER INVESTIGATORSOTHER

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.205
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE BETTER

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.873
TOOLS IN YOUR TOOLBOX FOR

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.643
ENFORCEMENT. IS THAT YOUR SAY WE

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.278
HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH HAVEN'T

01:53:38.344 --> 01:53:40.180
GOTTEN SPECIFIC ENOUGH CAN YOU

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:43.116
TO SPEAK TO WHAT'S MISSING. BUT

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:45.218
I WOULD SAY IS NOT SPECIFICITY-

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:46.419
BECAUSE THAT IS TO STATUTES THAT

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:48.521
I MENTIONED ARE DIRECTLY RELATED

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:50.990
TO PATIENT- KICKBACKS AND

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:53.760
FACILITY KICK- IT'S SPECIFIC TO

BODY BROKERING- WHICH IS IT

01:53:56.396 --> 01:53:57.730
SPECIFIC TERM IT DESCRIBES A

SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:02.368
ARE. I'M IN MY EYES- ARE DRIVING

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:04.470
FORCE BEHIND THE WELCOME TO

01:54:04.537 --> 01:54:07.073
FRAUD AND THE DEATHS IN THIS

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.875
INDUSTRY. YES AND I WOULD AGREE

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:11.077
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:13.580
ASSESSMENT I THINK. I AS WE HAVE

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.748
SEEN AT EVERY PHASE AND

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:17.517
CERTAINLY APPEARED CRISIS SADLY

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:20.153
WE HAVE SEEN. PREDATORY ACTORS

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:24.057
WHO HAVE- EXPLOITED THIS IS THE

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:26.359
CRISIS WHETHER IT WAS. THE DRUG

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.695
MANUFACTURERS TO BEGIN WITH THE

PRESCRIBE THIRD FOR NOW. BODY

BROKERS AND THESE REAL GREAT HAD

01:54:34.534 --> 01:54:36.736
CENTER OPERATORS WHO I SEE AN

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.037
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.572
OFF THE BACK OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:40.940
REALLY REALLY DESPERATE

01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:45.912
CIRCUMSTANCES- IT IS. HER AFFECT

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:50.483

THAT COULD BE TAKEN AT THE STATE

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:53.720
LEVEL THAT WOULD GIVE YOU AND

01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.788
FOLKS DOING SIMILAR WORK MORE

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:58.725
TOOLS FOR CRACKING DOWN ON POT

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:00.827
THAT THEIR FRAUDULENT AND BAD

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:03.596
ACTORS IN THIS SPACE. I WAS A

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:05.431
JUST A REPUTATIONAL RESOURCES

AND THAT INVESTIGATORS. THAT

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:10.403
COULD APPLY THEIR TIME-

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:12.538

01:55:12.605 --> 01:55:13.806

THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CITIES

01:55:19.646 --> 01:55:20.713
WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY THAT OFTEN

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:22.749
CASTIGATE HERS- AND IF WE COULD

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.851
ALL WORK TOGETHER SHARE THE SAME

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:29.088
OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAKE

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:31.958
UP A BIGGER TENT AND- THIS

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:36.029
PROBLEM. AND I THINK YOUR YOUR

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:39.098
COMMENTS. REALLY HIGHLIGHTING

01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:40.967
WHY THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A

01:55:41.034 --> 01:55:42.502
DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO WRAP OUR

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:44.671
HANDS AROUND THAT THE CHALLENGE

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:48.007
OF EFFECTIVE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:50.810
TREATMENT IS ENORMOUS. JUST IN

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:15.101
DOLLARS IT'S MADE IT EVEN IT'S

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.969
MADE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR

FACILITIES BEING LOCATED IN

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:11.858
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND I

01:57:11.924 --> 01:57:13.993
THINK ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:17.630
THAT- THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS IS

01:57:17.697 --> 01:57:21.834

CONCENTRATION OR CLUSTERING OF

DETOX FACILITIES ALL IN ONE

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:33.679
NEIGHBORHOOD OR ON A BLOCK

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:34.981
ACTUALLY CREATE

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:37.617
INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THAT

BY THAT ERROR HOMES LOCATED NEAR

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:52.932
ONE ANOTHER CREATES AN

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:54.167
INSTITUTION I THINK OF

01:57:54.233 --> 01:57:56.169
INSTITUTION AS OUR STATE

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.437
HOSPITALS I THINK ABOUT SKILLED

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:58.905
NURSING FACILITIES ARE SKILLED

01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:00.239
NURSING FACILITIES HOSPITALS

ETCETERA- AND SO IT JUST MAYBE

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:05.211
JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.546
COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE. THANK

YOU SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:11.117
EXAMPLE BECAUSE THE IN OUR CITY

HERE COSTA MESA. THERE WAS ONE

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:16.022
BLOCK AND IT WAS A COLD THE FACT

01:58:16.088 --> 01:58:17.857
STREET AND IT'S MUCH LIKE THE

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:20.726
STREET THAT- THE DETOX FACILITY

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:24.597
THAT- MISTER LEHRER LIVED IN-

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:29.569
WHAT SITUATED. THERE WERE. FOUR

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:33.139
DETOX OF THE LIVING HOMES- DRUG

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.408
REHAB TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:38.544
HAD BOUGHT RESIDENTIAL HOMES

01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:40.947
THREE BUSINESSES ON ONE SMALL

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:43.483
LITTLE CUL DE SAC LOT. AND WHAT

01:58:43.549 --> 01:58:45.051
HAPPENED TO THAT LITTLE COLDER

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:46.853
BACK NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IT

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:49.555
TRANSFORMED INTO AN

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:52.625
INSTITUTIONAL DOWN. AS THE OWNER

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:55.561
FOR TREATMENT AND RECOVERY AND

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:57.430
DETOX INSTEAD OF BEING A

01:58:57.497 --> 01:59:01.868
NEIGHBORHOOD. AND SO I WOULD. I

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.970
REQUEST THAT AS YOUR APPROVING

01:59:04.036 --> 01:59:06.639
THESE LICENSES THAT YOU TAKE

01:59:06.706 --> 01:59:09.242
INTO CONSIDERATION DISTANCING

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:12.078
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT YOU DON'T

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:15.648
CONCENTRATE. DETOX FACILITIES

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:19.085
ALL NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER. AND

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:22.021
SHOT TRANSFORM WHAT ARE

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:24.557
TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOODS INTO

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:26.893
LITERALLY INSTITUTIONS FOR

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:30.696
RECOVERY YEAH I HAVE BEEN. ONE

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:32.732
THAT SEVERAL LIVING HOW LONG A

DETOX FACILITY DRUG AND ALCOHOL

01:59:35.334 --> 01:59:38.271
TREATMENT FACILITY ALL NEXT TO

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:40.273
EACH OTHER OR MAYBE A HOUSE IN

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:42.875
BETWEEN THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:44.877
HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE ARE NO

01:59:44.944 --> 01:59:46.679
DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT

01:59:46.746 --> 01:59:48.481
ORDINANCE THAT I WAS REFERRING

01:59:48.548 --> 01:59:50.082
TO EARLIER FOR THE CITY OF COSTA

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:52.618
MESA AND THE COUNTY ORDINANCE AS

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:56.055
WELL. REQUIRE THAT- SEVERAL

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:58.991
LIVING HOMES NOT COLE LOCATED

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.793
RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE'S

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:03.129
DISPENSING REQUIREMENTS THE

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:05.665
STATE CURRENTLY DOES NOT AG

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:07.600
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY KIND OF

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:09.535
DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS AND SO

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:14.106
THE DEPARTMENT IS ESSENTIALLY-

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:19.011
LICENSING. HELLO OF- DETOX THIS

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:21.247
. AND ITS TRANSFER NAY. AND IT

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:23.816
REALLY JUST COUNTERED THIS IDEA

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:24.984
THAT YOU NEED TO LIVE IN A

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.385
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IN

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:27.620
ORDER TO GET TREATMENT I

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:30.389
APPRECIATE THAT CHAIRWOMAN'S-

02:00:30.456 --> 02:00:33.059
COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AS THE

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:36.395
FAMILY MEMBER I JUST WANT MY

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:38.197
LOVED ONE TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:41.867
HELPED. MEDICALLY BECAUSE DETOX

02:00:41.934 --> 02:00:44.737
IS ACTUALLY QUITE RISKY FOR MANY

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:46.572
HEALTH CONDITIONS SO WOULD YOU

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:48.674
BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE DEFENSE

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:51.077
TEAM REQUIREMENTS AT THE STATE

02:00:51.143 --> 02:00:57.617
LEVEL. I MEAN WE CAN DEFINITELY

02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:59.151
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.853
I THINK OUR OUR GOAL IS THAT WE

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:01.954
WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

02:01:02.021 --> 02:01:04.256
ACCESS- FORTY SERVICES

02:01:04.323 --> 02:01:06.659
THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND SO

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:07.460
WITH THAT IN MIND I THINK WE CAN

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:09.028
CONTINUE JUST TO TALK THROUGH

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.496
THESE TYPES OF IDEAS AND

02:01:10.563 --> 02:01:12.365
CONSIDERATIONS BUT YOU KNOW WE

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:14.667
ARE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.268
INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.603
TYPES OF TREATMENT AND RECOVERY

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:19.538
SERVICES AND IN THE COMMUNITY AS

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:22.375
WELL SO I THINK IT'S AT A POINT

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.610
THAT WE CAN FURTHER DISCUSS. DO

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.646
YOU HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:33.052
THAT THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS. I

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.487
MEAN IN TERMS OF THE MEDICAL

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.755
PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:37.023
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO THINK

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.257
THROUGH BECAUSE WE MUST CERTIFY

02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:39.592
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:40.793
WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:42.261
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE

02:01:42.328 --> 02:01:43.195
SERVICES TO OUR MEDICARE

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:44.764
BENEFICIARIES AND SO IT IS

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:46.232
SOMETHING THAT IS TOP OF MIND

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:48.367
FOR US FOR ALL OF OUR SERVICES

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:48.968
THAT WE DELIVER TO THE MEDICAL

02:01:49.035 --> 02:01:52.171
PROGRAM. OKAY I KNOW YOU FOCUS

02:01:52.238 --> 02:01:55.508
ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- A LOT

02:01:55.574 --> 02:01:57.777
DURING GAIT CONVERSATION TODAY.

02:01:57.843 --> 02:02:00.513
BUT MANY OF THESE. DETOX

02:02:00.579 --> 02:02:04.016
FACILITY ARE. BEING PAID THROUGH

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:06.752
PRIVATE INSURANCE AND SO I THINK

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:07.620
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD

02:02:07.687 --> 02:02:09.655
LOOK INTO AND WOULD YOU BE

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.691
WILLING TO LOOK INTO THAT HOW

02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:14.360
THE PRIVATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:17.730
IS ACTUALLY- THEY'RE THE ONES

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:19.498
THAT ARE BUYING UP PROPERTIES

02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:21.934
AND OPENING UP DETOX FACILITIES.

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:24.570
MORE SO THAN MEDIC CAL-

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:29.475
HAITIANS- TREATMENT SERVICES.

02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:30.142
AGAIN I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE

02:02:30.209 --> 02:02:30.943
CAN THINK THEY'RE IN THIS KIND

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.144
OF SPEAKS TO THE POINT OF THE

02:02:32.211 --> 02:02:33.879

ON ANY- TECHNICAL- THINGS

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:32.170

WILD FOLKS ARE. DETECTING AND IT

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:15.080
ALSO DEPENDS ON A LITTLE BIT

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:17.682
ONLINE- YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:19.951

WAS SO INITIAL THERE IS A

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:49.815
COMPREHENSIVE. AND THAT IF I-

02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:52.317
USUALLY EMPLOYS A SAM CRITERIA

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:53.819
TO LOOK AT THE APPROPRIATENESS

02:14:53.885 --> 02:14:55.353
OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEING ADMITTED

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.088

HISTORY ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:02.427
PROBLEMS- THE SPECIFICS OF THE-

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:03.829
TYPES OF SUBSTANCES THAT THEY

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:04.529
WERE USING AND THE

02:15:04.596 --> 02:15:06.398
APPROPRIATENESS OF. KENYA CAN

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:07.799
THE FACILITY HANDLE THAT SO TO

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:09.701
GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IF

02:15:09.768 --> 02:15:10.569
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WITH AN

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:12.471
ALCOHOL USE DISORDER WHO HAS HAD

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:13.939

EXPERIENCED DELIRIUM TREMENS

02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:18.310
WHICH IS A VERY TRAGIC- SIDE.

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:22.147
YOU KNOW BUT COMPLICATION. OF A

02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:22.881
SEVERE ALCOHOL USE WITHDRAWAL.

02:15:22.948 --> 02:15:23.949
THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:25.717
APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR AVERAGE

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:28.353
LEVEL THREE- YOU KNOW DETOX

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.589
CENTER- EVEN YOU KNOW THAT

02:15:30.655 --> 02:15:32.157
PERSON WOULD NEED TO BE IN A

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:34.526
MORE OF A- MEDICALLY MANAGED

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.194
POSSIBLY HOSPITAL BASED TYPE OF

02:15:36.261 --> 02:15:37.562
FACILITY THAT HAS THE TYPES OF

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:40.765
THINGS LIKE. AYE VISA AND- OTHER

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:42.100
TYPES OF THINGS THAT I SEE YOU

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:43.902
ACCESS UP SO THAT THE

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:45.136
TERMINATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:46.271
THE BEGINNING AND IF DONE IN THE

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:47.672
INAPPROPRIATELY WHICH IS.

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:48.840
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:50.742
SAY- IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:52.077
WOULD CRITICIZE A LOT OF

02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:53.812
TREATMENT CENTERS IS THAT. BUT

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:55.247
THE MEDICAL STAFF BECAUSE

02:15:55.313 --> 02:15:57.249
THERE'S BEEN THIS- YOU KNOW IF

02:15:57.315 --> 02:15:58.450
YOU LOOK AT THE EVOLUTION IN THE

02:15:58.517 --> 02:15:59.951
HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF HOW

02:16:00.018 --> 02:16:01.786
TREATMENT CENTERS HAVE EVOLVED.

02:16:01.853 --> 02:16:03.321
IT BACK IN THE DAY THEY WERE

02:16:03.388 --> 02:16:04.756
JUST THEY WERE STRIPPED OF

02:16:04.823 --> 02:16:06.725
MEDICAL ALMOST COMPLETELY I MEAN

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.426
UNTIL RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA

02:16:08.493 --> 02:16:09.895
RIGHT WITH IMS COULD YOU A

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:11.129
PHYSICIAN EVEN GO INTO A

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:12.464
FACILITY LIKE THAT TO DO WHAT

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:13.932
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. TO

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:16.334
ENSURE SAFETY- AND SO THERE'S

02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:18.770
BEEN THIS. KIND OF SUPPORT IN

02:16:18.837 --> 02:16:20.238
THE ROAD IN OF A CLINICAL

02:16:20.305 --> 02:16:21.172
APPROACH VERSUS A MEDICAL

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:22.474
APPROACH WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:25.176
BECAUSE HMAN BEING. REGARDLESS

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:25.911
THAT YOU KNOW YOU NEED ALL THAT

02:16:25.977 --> 02:16:28.280
IS COMPREHENSIVE AND SO- BUT BUT

02:16:28.346 --> 02:16:29.948
IF THAT DETERMINATION GETS DONE

02:16:30.015 --> 02:16:31.116
INAPPROPRIATELY THAN A PERSON

02:16:31.182 --> 02:16:32.484
GETS ADMITTED INAPPROPRIATELY

02:16:32.551 --> 02:16:33.785
AND ALL SORTS OF BAD THINGS

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:35.687
HAPPEN AND THEN. ISSUES AROUND

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:37.989
STAFFING AND- WHAT WAS ALREADY

02:16:38.056 --> 02:16:38.990
MENTIONED YOU KNOW LIKE FOR

02:16:39.057 --> 02:16:40.458
EXAMPLE THE EVERY THIRTY MINUTES

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:42.861
CHECKS FOR VITAL SIGNS IN A

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:44.529
YEAR. THIS IS WHERE YOU BEGIN TO

02:16:44.596 --> 02:16:45.630
SEIZE IT WHEN IT WHEN THERE'S

02:16:45.697 --> 02:16:47.465
BREAK DOWNS- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:48.967
THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT IT TYPICALLY

02:16:49.034 --> 02:16:51.369
IN AN UNCOMPLICATED SITUATION

02:16:51.436 --> 02:16:52.470
FOR ALCOHOL MAYBE THREE TO FIVE

02:16:52.537 --> 02:16:55.040
DAYS. BUT TYPICALLY FOR OPIOIDS

02:16:55.106 --> 02:16:56.474
YOU MIGHT BE FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS

02:16:56.541 --> 02:17:01.546
IF THEY'RE USING- AT A TAPER.

02:17:01.613 --> 02:17:02.080
WITH THAT MEDICATION LIKE

02:17:02.147 --> 02:17:03.615
BUPRENORPHINE. BENDED AS- WHICH

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:05.083
IS SEDATIVE. ARE TRIANGLE. CAN

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:07.385
SOMETIMES TAKE A BIT. AND CASES

02:17:07.452 --> 02:17:08.720
. AS YOU PUMP IMAGINE A LOT OF

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:10.288
TIMES WHAT ISN'T INSERTED INTO

02:17:10.355 --> 02:17:13.358
THE ISSUE IS. COVERAGE SO IS IT

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:15.226
A COVERED DAY FOR THEM TO IS THE

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:17.529
INSURANCE COMPANY- SAYING NO

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.964
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE AND THERE'S

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:20.432
JUST BACK AND FORTH THAT. THE

02:17:20.498 --> 02:17:21.800
FACILITY IS ALWAYS ASKING FOR

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.335
MORE BAD DAYS. AND THEN THE

02:17:23.401 --> 02:17:24.302
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ARE

02:17:24.369 --> 02:17:25.637
TRYING TO COMPARE TO THEIR

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:27.339
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TO SEE IF

02:17:27.405 --> 02:17:28.506
IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO THERE'S

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:29.841
THIS DANCE THAT HAPPENS BACK AND

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.543
FORTH MANY VARIABLES AND THEN

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:33.111
THERE'S THE EVOLUTION OF WHAT'S

02:17:33.178 --> 02:17:35.313
HAPPENING. THAT YOU KNOW WITH

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:36.982
WITH THE PATIENTS SO WE HAD THIS

02:17:37.048 --> 02:17:39.351
WEIRD SYSTEM WITH EVEN WITH IMS.

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:42.020
THAT YOU CAN YOU COULD DO

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:43.989
MEDICAL THINGS THAT ARE RELATED

02:17:44.055 --> 02:17:46.725
TO DETOX. BUT YOU'RE NOT REALLY

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:47.926
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING MEDICAL

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:49.728
THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

02:17:49.794 --> 02:17:51.062
SCOPE OF THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:53.231
SEND THEM OUT. TO A PROVIDER

02:17:53.298 --> 02:17:55.400
OUTSIDE OF THAT FACILITY TO GET

02:17:55.467 --> 02:17:56.601
THAT TAKEN CARE OF AN EXAMPLE

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:57.969
WOULD BE. LET'S SAY SOMEBODY

02:17:58.036 --> 02:17:59.671
COMES IN WITH THE INSULIN PUMP.

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:02.574
AND AND THEN MAYBE AN INFECTION

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:03.108
THAT NEEDS AN INCISION AND

02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:04.376
DRAINAGE. BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:05.677
PEOPLE INJECT INTO THEIR ARM FOR

02:18:05.744 --> 02:18:06.978
EXAMPLE OR OTHER THINGS-

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:09.114
PNEUMONIA. TECHNICALLY THAT'S

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:11.516
NOT DETOX SO I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.084
BE ABLE TO GIVE A MEDICATION TO

02:18:13.151 --> 02:18:14.619
DO AN INTERVENTION. THIS IS A

02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:15.787
SEND THEM OUT TO AN URGENT CARE

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:17.455
FACILITY TO AT THEIR PRIVATE

02:18:17.522 --> 02:18:18.723
DOCTOR OR ANOTHER WAY TO SET IT

02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:20.825
UP. WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:21.860
THAT IF YOU CAN IMAGINE IF

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:22.360
YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:24.229
WITHDRAWAL MANAGEMENT- THAT

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:25.730
SOMEBODY. PUT YOU IN A VAN AND

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.866
SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE AND WE

02:18:27.932 --> 02:18:28.600
JUST WOULDN'T DO THESE THINGS

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:30.702
FOR OTHER CONDITIONS- YOU KNOW

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:32.704
LAY ABOUT THE PRESSURES. SO BUT

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:33.972
BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE GENERAL

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:35.674
GIST THAT EVALUATION. THEN

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:37.642
THERE'S THE- CARRYING OUT OF

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:40.612
MEDICATION MANAGEMENT USUALLY-

02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:42.480
THE LICENSE- AT PRESCRIBER WILL

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:43.748
BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OF THE

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.650
MEDICATIONS DIFFERENT FACILITIES

02:18:45.717 --> 02:18:46.251
WOULD DO IT DIFFERENTLY WHERE

02:18:46.317 --> 02:18:47.385
SOMETIMES IT JUST. PATIENT COMES

02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:48.853
IN WIT THEIR- PRESCRIPTION. AND

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:49.754
OTHER FACILITIES THEY HAVE THE

02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.089
WAY THAT THEY CAN GET ORDERED IF

02:18:51.156 --> 02:18:52.924
THEY HAVE AN IRON MASK IN ORDER

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:53.925
TO THEIR THE TRONIC MEDICAL

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:55.727
RECORD THEN IT GETS THERE. THE

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:57.228
MUSIC. OF PROBLEMS ABOUT GETTING

02:18:57.295 --> 02:19:03.601
MEDICINES- DON'T EVEN. GET ME

02:19:03.668 --> 02:19:04.369
STARTED THERE THANK THE- IS

02:19:04.436 --> 02:19:06.104
FILLING MEDICINES LIKE CUBAN. IN

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.439
ORANGE COUNTY. THIS IS A PLAGUE

02:19:07.505 --> 02:19:09.874
WE- GET. PHARMACY TO. IT AND

02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:12.077
THEN PATIENTS GOING AROUND FIVE

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:13.845
SIX SEVEN PLACES. AND AND YOU

02:19:13.912 --> 02:19:16.281
KNOW LOOKING FOR. WHERE JUST

02:19:16.347 --> 02:19:17.382
WHERE TO GET SOURCE THEIR

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.050
MEDICATIONS AND THAT BECOMES A

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.218
PROBLEM FOR TREATMENT CENTERS

02:19:20.285 --> 02:19:21.252
THAT ARE IN HOMES THAT YOU

02:19:21.319 --> 02:19:22.487
MENTIONED WHERE THEY'RE JUST

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:24.355
SENDING SOMEBODY ATTACK OUT IN

02:19:24.422 --> 02:19:25.390
YOU KNOW TO GO PICK UP PICK UP

02:19:25.457 --> 02:19:26.825
THE METS. THIS IS NOT A PLACE

02:19:26.891 --> 02:19:28.793
WITH A PHARMACY THAT DISPENSES

02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:30.061
THE MEDICATIONS AND YOU HAVE

02:19:30.128 --> 02:19:31.262
ACCESS TO THE MEDICATION THERE

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:33.098
COULD BE A WHOLE DAY. THAT

02:19:33.164 --> 02:19:34.499
PASSES BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.134
ACCESS TO YOUR MEDICATIONS THAT

02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:39.204
THE DOCTOR ORDERED A DAY AGO- IN

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.605
WHICH IT HAD BEEN A YOU KNOW

02:19:40.672 --> 02:19:41.840
ISSUES OF WHY WE GET BAD

02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:44.776
OUTCOMES FOR THAT AS WELL. SO

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:45.944
LIKE I SAID DON'T GET ME STARTED

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.412
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS

02:19:47.479 --> 02:19:49.080
THAT'S THE GENERAL GIST OF HOW

02:19:49.147 --> 02:19:50.315
THAT DID THE DETOX PROCESS

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:52.517
HAPPENS IN THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO

02:19:52.584 --> 02:19:54.385
EXPECT. I THINK YOU GET THANK

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:55.386
YOU FOR JUMPING IN ON THAT

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:56.955
QUESTION AND PROVIDING THAT

02:19:57.021 --> 02:20:02.193
CONTEXT AND- I'M- I THINK WHEN.

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:03.495
ONE QUESTION I'D HAVE OPPOSED TO

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:07.699
BOTH OF YOU. IS THE QUESTION OF

02:20:07.766 --> 02:20:09.434
WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY MEDICLLY

02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:13.204
APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INTENSE HE

02:20:13.271 --> 02:20:14.672
SAID IT'S WE'RE TALKING THREE TO

02:20:14.739 --> 02:20:16.674
FIVE DAYS OR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS

02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:19.110
ON AVERAGE. IS IT MEDICALLY

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:21.880
APPROPRIATE FOR THESE DETOX

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:23.748
FACILITIES TO BE IN SOMEBODY'S

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:28.887
GARAGE. WELL SO PROBABLY NOT A

02:20:28.953 --> 02:20:30.889
GARAGE RIGHT SO THERE'S THAT

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.357
THERE THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:34.192
ALMOST LIKE AND IF IT'S IF IT'S

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.895
A VERY MILD WITHDRAWAL AND THIS

02:20:36.961 --> 02:20:38.029
IS WHY YOU NEED YOU NEED THE

02:20:38.096 --> 02:20:39.631
SKILL OF SOMEBODY THAT

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:41.432
UNDERSTANDS HOW TO EVEN APPEAR

02:20:41.499 --> 02:20:44.169
APPROPRIATELY- GAUGE WHAT THAT

02:20:44.235 --> 02:20:45.737
WHAT THAT IS AND THAT'S WHY WHEN

02:20:45.804 --> 02:20:47.105
WE TALK ABOUT THE SAME CRITERIA

02:20:47.172 --> 02:20:49.107
FOR EXAMPLE A LEVEL FOUR WOULD

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:50.175
BE THE PERSON THAT I MENTIONED

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:52.076
THAT HAD STATE HISTORY OF

02:20:52.143 --> 02:20:53.678
DELIRIUM TREMENS OR HISTORY OF

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:55.380
SEIZURES. THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD

02:20:55.446 --> 02:20:58.550
BUT LET'S SAY SOMEBODY THAT- YOU

02:20:58.616 --> 02:20:59.617
KNOW THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING FOR.

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:01.519
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS- AND THEY

02:21:01.586 --> 02:21:03.221
SHOW UP AND IT NEVER HAD ANY

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:05.056
SORT OF OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES OR

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.257
ANYTHING ALONG THAT LINE. THAT

02:21:06.324 --> 02:21:08.193
PERSON OFTENTIMES WE JUST. YOU

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:09.727
KNOW ARE NOT NECESSARILY NEED A

02:21:09.794 --> 02:21:12.630
NEED MEDICATIONS- SO. THERE'S

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:14.299
DEFINITELY A LOT OF SPECIFICS TO

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:15.433
THE FACILITY KIND OF LIKE YOU

02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.768
WOULD HAVE A FEW SOME PEOPLE GET

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:19.671
HOME HEALTH. WE DO DO WE DO DO-

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:21.306
MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND MEDICAL

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:23.541
THERAPIES IN PEOPLE'S HOMES-

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:24.943
JUST IN GENERAL IN OTHER AREAS

02:21:25.009 --> 02:21:26.578
OF MEDICINE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IN

02:21:26.644 --> 02:21:29.047
THAT IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATELY

02:21:29.113 --> 02:21:30.782
ASSESSED. WHICH IS KIND OF A THE

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.050
WAY I THINK YOU MAY BE GETTING

02:21:32.116 --> 02:21:32.684
AT IS THAT THERE COULD BE PEOPLE

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:34.752
THAT NEED MORE. THAN A HOME

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:35.720
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE AND

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:37.589
THAT'S NOT ENDORSED EVEN BY THE

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:40.959
SAME CRITERIA. SO WHEN THAT GOES

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:42.627
WRONG BAD THINGS HAPPEN. YES YES

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:46.030
