PRESENT A BILL AND MY BILLS LAST BILL FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR QUORUM SO. HOPEFULLY BE BACK WITHIN TEN MINUTES AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE CORN SO JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THANKS GOOD MORNING THIS IS THE WEDNESDAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. AT THIS TIME WE STILL DO NOT HAVE QUORUM SO WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO PLEASE JOIN US BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT -- I WILL WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE QUORUM TO CALL ROLE BUT WILL ASK OUR FIRST AUTHOR. FILE ITEM FIVE AB FOR ELEVEN MISTER STONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE BUT IT. I HAVE REVIEWED THE ANALYSIS OF AB FOR ELEVEN AND PROVIDES GOOD ANALYSIS I WON'T COMMENT ON THAT AND I'LL KEEP THE REST OF MY COMMENTS. VERY BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE A FULL AGENDA TODAY. PRIOR THE DISSOLUTION OF CALIFORNIA REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ THROUGH ITS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY HAD CONSTRUCTING NEARLY. TWELVE HUNDRED TWELVE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS IN THE CITY. THREE HUNDRED AND SIX OF THESE FOR VERY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE REFERRED LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. THIS IS A REMARKABLE RECORD FOR CITY OF JUST SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AGAIN IT WAS TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS UNFORTUNATELY. THE ABRUPT DISSOLUTION OF THE CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE LEFT A NUMBER OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS STRANDED. IN ONE OF MS STILL STRANDED TODAY. AND SINCE THAT TIME ALSO SANTA CRUZ HAS BECOME ONE OF THE LESSER AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES IN A HOUSING MARKET IN OUR NATION. IT'S GREAT HAS A GROWING UC CAMPUS AND IT'S VERY EXPERIENCING THE HOUSING PRESSURES OF SILICON VALLEY. WHAT IS ALSO UNIQUE ABOUT OUR CITY IS A WE STILL HAVE AVAILABLE STAFF TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWO OF US RIGHT HERE? WE ARE PART OF THE RECORD OF TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS WERE PROUD OF IT AND WE'D LIKE TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. WITH THE FUNDING FROM A. B. FOR ELEVEN WE CAN START TO PROCEED ON SOME OF THESE PROJECTS AND WHAT ARE THESE PROJECTS. ONE OF THEM IS A LARGE TRANSIT CENTER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRANSIT CENTER. IN IT'LL BE ALMOST ALL ENTIRELY AFFORDABLE IF WE RECEIVE ASSISTANCE LIKE A BEFORE. ELEVEN THERE ARE OTHER SOME OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT MAY COME ONLINE AND WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THEM IF THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN FINANCING. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THE FUNDING TO AB FOR ELEVEN WILL ALLOW US TO MEET OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE PAST WITH REDEVELOPMENT AND NOW WE'RE CHALLENGE WITHOUT IT. AS THE PROVISIONS FOR THE HOMELESS HOUSING IN A BEFORE ELEVEN SANTA CRUZ IS THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL PROVIDER OF HOMELESS HOUSING IN OUR COUNTY. AND RIGHT NOW OUR CAPACITY HAS BEEN REACHED IF YOU COME IN YOUR TOWN YOU'LL SEE A CAMPSITE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE LIKE MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES AB FOR ELEVEN WILL HELP US ASSIST THAT. AND MOVE FORWARD ON SOME NEW HOUSING RESOURCES FOR IT. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT A BEFORE. ELEVEN KATHY NEIER HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME SECRETS TO OUR ABILITY TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF YOU NEED ANY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE LOVE YOU TO SUBMIT THE SECRETS IN WRITING TO ALL OF US -- WITH THAT UNLESS OR ANY QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE -- HE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION. SIX SCENE NINE OUT WE DO NOT YET HAVE QUORUM WE ARE ONE VOTE SHORT BUT AS SOON AS WE DO WE WILL -- ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN CLOSING LET ME ACTUALLY JUST A VERIFY BELIEVE YOU HAVE AGREED TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT. WE'VE DISCUSSED YES THANK YOU FOR A REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO THE MEMBERS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND WITH THAT I'D TO US HERE I BOTH GREAT AND THAT -- I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ALL AVAILABLE FUNDS. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DURING THE CURRENT CRISIS AND WE DON'T WANT FUNDS TO BE SITTING ON YOU SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT WE WILL TAKE A VOTE WHEN WE HAVE COR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S CALL UP OUR NEXT AUTHOR FILE ITEM THREE MISTER CHAPMAN AB. SEVENTEEN THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I I LIKE TO START DAHLE BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. TO REQUIRE H. CD TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ALL WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM AND ALSO TO REQUIRE EACH CD TO CREATE A NOTICE ABOUT THE PROGRAM. THAT PARK OWNERS CAN USE TO INFORM RESIDENTS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. AB ONE SEVENTY THREE PROMOTES THE ACCURATE TITLING OF MOBILE HOMES BY EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE. ON THE REGISTER YOUR MOBILE HOME CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH IS A FEE AND ABATEMENT PROGRAM UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO MOBILE HOMES ARE REGULARLY SOLD ON A SOMEWHAT INFORMAL BASIS. A PROBLEM ARISES WHEN A BUYER SUBSEQUENTLY TRIES TO TRANSFER TITLE INTO HIS OR HER NAME AND THEN DISCOVERS THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER FELL BEHIND ON THEIR TAX BILL. THE BUYER IS UNABLE TO PAY DOWN THE TITLE CANNOT TRANSFER. AS A RESULT SOME BUYERS ARE IN A SITATION WHERE THEY PAY FOR THEIR HOME BUT YET HAVE NO MEANINGFUL PROOF OF OWNERSHIP. WHICH COULD CAUSE A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO LEGALLY MAKE REPAIRS TO THE HOME. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED -- AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISH A TAX ABATEMENT PROGRAM CALLED THE REGISTER YOUR MOBILE HOME CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. OF FOR HOME A MOBILE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE WHO ARE UNABLE TO TRANSFER TITLE OF THEIR HOMES INTO. THEIR NAMES DUE TO TAX DELINQUENCIES THAT MAY HAVE. BEEN A CURB BY PRIOR OWNERS. THE BILL PROVIDED ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS THE ABILITY TO APPLY TO APPLY FOR THE ABATEMENT PROGRAM WITH THE H. CD. OUR IS A MOBILE HOME IS ON THE LOCAL TAX A PROPERTY TAX SO THAT IS L. P. T. SYSTEM. THEN THE COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR IS INVOLVED IN PROCESSING AND APPROVING THE TAX ABATEMENT. THE BILL FURTHER REQUIRE SELLERS TO OBTAIN A TRANSFER CLEARANCE TITLE OF FROM THE CD INDICATING THAT EX CD. IN FACT THE MAY LEGALLY AMEND THE TITLE PRIOR TO ANY SALE. NOW SINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN APPROXIMATELY TOLL A TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MOBILE HOME OWNERS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE. OF THE PROGRAM WHICH HAS RESULTED IN MOBILE HOME OWNERS SAVING OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE PROGRAM IS ON PACE TO SAVE MOBILE HOMEOWNERS ABOUT TO THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS BY THE TIME IT AT SUNSETS ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN DESPITE THE SUCCESS THERE. THERE ARE STILL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS SO WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM. THIS BILL AB ONE SEVENTY THREE WOULD EXTEND THE SUNSET ON THIS PROGRAM. FOR THREE YEARS TO CONTINUE TO HELP -- MOBILE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO TRANSFER -- TITLE OF THEIR HOME INTO THEIR NAMES DUE TO TAX DELINQUENCIES THAT THEY MAY HAVE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY PRIOR TO OWNERS. OF WITHOUT AYE A HEALTH -- TWO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY TO SUPPORT THE BUILT OUR MISTER BRUCE STANTON AND ALSO MISTER ROGERS JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR. ALL THAT IS THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURE HOMEOWNERS TO LEAK. SO WITHOUT A LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE TWO GENTLEMEN AND BEFORE YOU WENT AS A STAR LIKE TO ESTABLISH QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TO HEAR TO HEAR DEEP. DEEP HERE GABRIELLE. GABRIELLE HERE GLORIA. KILEY LEE MOM. LIMÃ³N HERE MAIENSCHEIN. MENTION HERE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA HERE AND SINCE WE HAVE COR LIKE TO ALSO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE RULES I COULD HAVE A MOTION. THE GROUP BY MISS THEM ON SECONDED BY. MISTER YEP MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHIU THERE ARE CHU LAI TO IT DEEP. YES. HI GABRIELLE GABRIELLE I GLORIA. KILEY. LEE MON. THE ONE I MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE YOU CAN RULES ARE ADOPTED -- LET'S GO BACK TO THE BILL PRESENTATION AND TO YOUR WITNESSES. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ROGER JOHNSON. AND I LIVE IN A MOBILE HOME. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE GOLDEN STATE. MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE KNOWN AS GSM. KNOWN AS GSM WHILE -- I'M REPRESENTING SENIORS VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY. THAT THE PROPOSED MEASURE IS NOT AN AMNESTY. THAT IS. THAT THE OPPONENTS CALL IT. IT IMPLIES IN THIS CASE A COMPLETE FORGIVENESS OF TAXES. RATHER THIS BILL IS A WIN WIN. A WIN FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO TRANSFER TITLE INTO THEIR NAME. IN A WIN FOR THE STATE AND COUNTIES. WHO CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE RECORDS SO THAT TAXES AND FEES -- CAN BE COLLECTED FROM THE PROPER INDIVIDUALS. IT IS DEVASTATING WHEN A PERSON DISCOVERS THAT A TITLE CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MOBILE HOME HAS BEEN PAID OFF. FOR MANY RESIDENTS IT WILL BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME. THE DEPARTMENT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DATA. SHOWS EXISTING PROGRAM HAS ASSISTED OVER TWO THOUSAND MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS. END QUOTE. STEADY INCREASE MONTH OVER MONTH IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. GS SO MORRELL SUPPORTS A. B.. ONE SEVEN THREE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRUCE STANTON OF THE CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR GSM A WELL THE SAME ORGANIZATION THAT MISTER. A JOHNSON JUST SPOKE ABOUT THIS IS BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MANUFACTURED MOBILE HOMES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN FACT IF YOU GO TO DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING THEY HAVE ONE ROOM. AND ALL FOUR WALLS ARE THE CUBBY HOLES WITH THE BASKETS OF THESE DEFECTIVE TITLES AND THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW TO CONTACT THESE PEOPLE. OR HOW TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM SO THIS BILL WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN STARTING US DOWN THAT PATH. THE ISSUES ARE CAUSED BY NO ESCROW BEING USED STALE LENDERS BEING ON TITLE THAT DON'T EXIST ANYMORE AND NOBODY KNEW FOR YEARS HOW TO REMOVE THOSE LEGAL OWNERS FROM TITLE -- OR SALES JUST OUTRIGHT SALES WITH BAD TITLE THE RESULTS ARE HOMEOWNERS OR WHO ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES POSSIBLY BEING TERMINATED IF PARK OWNERS -- WERE TO USE THAT TO SAY YOU'RE NOT. A PROPER TITLE HOLDER SO YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE PARK AND AND IN MANY CASES NOT BEING ABLE TO GET PERMITS FROM H. C. D. TO DO. NECESSARY REPAIRS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S TWO WAYS OF REGISTERING HOMES I. L. T. AND L. P. T.. I. L. T. IS IN LIEU OF TAX WHICH IS PAID BY A REGISTRATION FEE TO DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING H. C. D.. L. P. T. IS LOCAL PROPERTY TAX PAID TO THE COUNTIES. THE BREAKDOWN IS APPROXIMATELY ON L. P. T. ACCORDING TO H. C. D.. SO AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THESE FIRST THREE YEARS WE CAN SEE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AT THE L. P. T. LEVEL WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT OF FIFTY TWO COUNTIES REPORTING SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS WERE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IN DOLLAR SAVINGS 15% OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT COUNTY LEVEL RESULTED IN 62% OF THE COST SAVINGS. SO THE L. P. T. IS ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR WAITED IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS -- SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT WE'VE WE'VE ASSISTED AS MUCH AS WE CAN WITH THE PENETRATION AND THE OUT REACH OF THE PROGRAM. HAVING MORE USED TO DO THAT I THINK WOULD EVEN ACCELERATE THE SUCCESS ESPECIALLY WITH MINORITY. UNITY IS WHERE FOLKS NOT UNDERSTANDING ENGLISH FOR HAVING MORE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUE. I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT SMALL IS NOT A PRINCIPLE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD USE TO EXCLUDE MINORITIES OF ANY SIZE FROM EQUAL PROTECTION. AND THAT'S ONE OF OUR LARGEST CONCERNS HI HERE WITH THE PROGRAM AS IT RELATES TO THIS VALUABLE PIECE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. BY BRIAN A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION SUPPORT. ANIME NOW ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEN NONE LET AS BRINGS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE LET ME FIRST FOR FOR MISTER -- MISTER CHAI I ASSUME YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE MOMENTS YES RIGHT. AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ADDRESS WHAT IS. CHALLENGING MANY OF OUR MARGINALIZED AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND BUILDING SOME REAL ASSETS AND I THINK WHILE ALL OF US WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE DIDN'T SEE GREATER UP TECH -- WE ARE ALL HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL HAVE MORE FOLKS THAT USES PROGRAM INTO THE COMING YEARS. I DO WANT TO KNOW AT THE END OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS I DO THINK IF WE DO NOT SEE GREATER SUCCESSES OBVIOUSLY WE PROBABLY NEED. TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT GREATER OVERSIGHT OR OTHER APPROACHES BUT I THINK CERTAINLY IT IS WORTH US -- MOVING THIS FOR FOR ANOTHER THREE YEARS LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES. NOW. OKAY THERE'S BEEN A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU LIKE TO MAKE. I JUST LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR LISTENING AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FARRAGO. AND WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY. MOTIONS TO PRICES AMENDED IN REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. CHIU HI CHIU I GAVE HI I GABRIELLE. GET REAL I GLORIA. KILEY. LEE MON [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN I WORK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. YOUR BILL IS OUT WE WILL WAIT TO ADD ON ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE. LET'S GO NOW TO FILE ITEM SIX EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TODAY TO PRESENT AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH CREATES A NARROW EXEMPTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. TO SELL DEED RESTRICTED LAND TO ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS AND PROVIDES THE NEXT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY HOME OWNERSHIP TO THOSE IN NEED UNNECESSARY HOUSING TO THOSE IN NEED. DUE TO THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF LAND PARTICULARLY IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES LAND COSTS OF REACHING ALL TIME HIGH. THIS WILL BILL WOULD BETTER UTILIZE SINGLE FAMILY LOTS BY PROVIDING TWO HOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN NEED ONE BEING THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND THE SECOND EIGHTY YOU ON THE SAME PARCEL OF LAND. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE BEST WAY FOR A FAMILY TO CREATE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND TO BUILD ASSETS. FOR OVER FORTY YEARS THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HAS BEEN HELPING LOW INCOME FAMILIES CLIMB THE ECONOMIC LADDER AND TO CREATE STABILITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. EIGHTY USE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE'S IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TO SOLVING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. STATE A LAW STATE LAW ALLOWS JURISDICTIONS TO CREATE THEIR OWN EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS OR IF NO LOCAL ORDINANCE EXISTS TO APPROVE UP. TO THE APPROVAL OF EIGHTY YOU SUBJECT TO STATE STATUTE. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW PREVENTS A SINGLE FAMILY LOTS FROM BEING SUBDIVIDED SO YOU CAN'T KERR UNDER CURRENT LAW SO THAT EIGHTY YOU SEPARATELY FROM THE HOUSE. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY MONTEREY BAY HIS WORK WITH THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO BUILD EIGHTY USER OWNER OCCUPIED STRUCTURE THAT. STRUCTURE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND IS HELD JOINTLY BY THE TO HOMEOWNERS SUCH AS TENANTS IN COMMON -- TI SEES AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS PROGRAM THAT WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH STATEWIDE IS AN OFTEN FOR COMMUNITIES WERE NOT FORCING COMMUNITIES TO DO THIS WE WANT TO MAKE IT AN OPTION WHICH RIGHT NOW DOESN'T REALLY EXIST UNDER STATE LAW. I'M AB TWO FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN CODE OF FIRES THIS PROGRAM WITH A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION FOR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IN ORDER TO SERVE TWICE AS MANY FAMILIES ON THE SINGLE LOCKS THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE ACCESS. TO IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HOUSE. THOSE IN NEED -- WHO? COULD WHO NEED A HOME AND THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE HABITAT CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD AND CREATE STABILITY FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE WELL OPENING UP NEW OPTIONS FOR HOME OWNERSHIP THAT DOESN'T EXST RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT EIGHTY YOU -- ORDINANCES WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS RICARDO DELA CRUZ OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY FROM SANTA CRUZ TO MONTEREY BAY AND JOHN LYNN HART FROM HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF YOU COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH ITEM. WELL LET ME START BY THANKING YOU. FOR INVITING US. AND I'M AND DO THIS QUICKLY BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU GET INTO THE SUBJECT WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION WE ALWAYS WANT TO SHARE -- OUR HABITAT -- WHICH SHOW. PRIMARILY REPRESENTS SANTA CRUZ AND WE'RE OPENING UP MORE ACTIVITY AND MONTEREY COUNTY THOSE OF YOU MAY KNOW IS A FAIRLY LARGE PLACE. THAT ONE AND WE HAVE A MONTEREY IN THE OTHER AND WE HAVE KING CITY AND WE HAVE MANY MANY HOUSING TYPE ISSUES. SO. BY A OUT PURSUING -- THIS BILL PERFECTLY FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN YOU ACTUALLY ARE OFFERING US A BETTER WAY OF DELIVERING A PRODUCT -- IF WE IMAGINE NOW BORE BUILDING NEW CONSTRUCTION A NEW HOME. AND THEN WERE ABLE -- TO AND A SMALL UNIT WHERE TWO DIFFERENT BUYERS CAN SHARE THAT PARCEL. WE ARE AS A AS A NONPROFIT OR ABLE. TO PRODUCE. TWO HOUSES FOR TWO DIFFERENT FAMILY TYPES ON THE SAME PARCEL. ARE ON NEW CONCERN OUR SENIORS WE'RE LEARNING MORE MORE LEASE ON THE COASTLINE. DATA MANY ARE BECOMING C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AS&lt;/c&gt;</u> A HOMELESS. AND FOR WHATEVER REASON -- THEY'RE STRUGGLING AND RENTALS AND TO HAVE THIS AVAILABLE TO THEM OR A NEW FAMILY A YOUNG FAMILY A SMALL FAMILY. AGAIN OPENS UP TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR US -- IN IN SUMMARY I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WERE WORKING CLOSELY NOW WITH SEASIDE THE MERCI SITE -- SEASIDE DEL REY OAKS MARINA AND ST CITY OR CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE GOVERNOR AS COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO PROVIDE. MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I AND THIS WOULD BE ONE WAY. WHERE WE AGAIN CAN PROVIDE PROVIDE TWO QUICK PRODUCTS -- FOR THE EFFORT. TO ONE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY -- MONEY JOHN ONE HARD ON FROM CHICO AND REPRESENTING HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUTTE COUNTY. ON IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING RICK'S BEEN SAYING -- WE HAVE A UNIQUE PROBLEM IN THE CHICO AREA IN THE BUTTE COUNTY AREA. IN THAT WE JUST EXPERIENCE THE CAMPFIRE. AND SO WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR POPULATION IN THE COUNTY THAT HAS BEEN DISPLACED -- PARADISE IS HAS BEEN PREDOMINATELY A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN NOTICING IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF SENIORS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOUSING AND HAVE. PROBABLY NO REAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE CURRENT MARKET. TO GET A NEW HOUSE OF CURRENTLY IN CHICO WE HAVE THREE LOTS THAT WERE GETTING READY TO START BUILDING ON AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE THIS -- NEW LAW COMING INTO PLACE SO THAT WE CAN OFFER NOT ONLY. THREE FAMILIES IN CHICO BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- THREE ADDITIONAL DWELLING UNITS -- FOR PARADISE SENIORS. ON THIS WOULD BE AN IDEAL SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A SMALLER FAMILY. EITHER ONE OR TWO INDIVIDUALS. THAT -- WE CAN PLACE IN AN EIGHTY YOU IT DOESN'T END UP IMPACTING OUR OUR CURRENT LAND INVENTORY WHICH IS VIRTUALLY. ZERO AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REALLY SERVE BOTH COMMUNITIES VERY WELL -- IT'S JUST IT MAKES SENSE FOR US I THINK IT WOULD PROVIDE A GREAT SERVICE TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO UNFORTUNATELY. HAVE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO AND WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO GET THEM INTO HOUSING -- AND BE ABLE TO TRANSFER OWNERSHIP SHOULD THIS PASS. ON IN A IN A LEGAL AND FAIR WAY. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR ANY CONSIDERATION AND I HOPE THAT -- YOU CAN CHECK FOR TO A IN THIS ORDINANCE. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER MODEL THAT WOULD EXIST UNDER THIS BILL IS THAT UGH. ALL OF FIVE NONPROFIT LIKE HABITAT OR ANOTHER COULD SELL DIFFERENT UNIT AND RETAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE REAR UNIT AND THEN USE IT IS A LOW INCOME RENTAL OR A MUNICIPALITY ITSELF THERE HOUSING AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE SAME THING. SO THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN THAT -- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW DOESN'T EXIST UNDER CURRENT LAW. THIS WORKS OF FIRST OF ALL TO THE AUTHOR I REALLY. LIKE THIS BILL SO I'D LIKE TO BE -- ADDED ON AS A JOINT AUTHORED -- BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF POLICY THAT I THINK IN THE CRISIS THAT WE ARE IN NOW SHOWS NOT ONLY -- CREATIVITY BUT ALSO LOOKING AT EXISTING LAND AND WORKING WITH TRUSTED PARTNERS LIKE HABITAT -- SO WITH THAT I MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU WOULD BE A LOT OF HONOR TAX ID WAS A CO AUTHOR. JOINT. JOINT AUTHORED. AND WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT SUPPORT THE BILL. TONY WITH CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION HERE SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SAYS THE MATTER NOT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIAN BE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. AND ARE THERE ANY POINT TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEN IT NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. I WANT TO THANK MS FREEMAN -- FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I THINK ALL OF US ARE BIG SUPPORTERS WHAT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HAVE BEEN DOING AND I THINK IN RECENT YEARS THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN VERY FOCUSED AND HOW WE EXPAND AN INCREASE EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION. I THINK THIS IS A VERY SMART WAY OF MARION A NUMBER OF VERY GOOD THINGS AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN COMMITTEE TODAY AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND I THINK DID I HEAR SECOND -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

AND SECOND PART IS A UPON THE UNDER THE EXISTING LAW. PART OWNERS AND OPERATORS MUST DEVELOP AND MAKE ASSESSABLE A PARK EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. AB THREE THREE A BILL ON THOSE REQUIREMENTS -- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. WILL LEAD REQUIRED HIM TO TRANSLATE THIS EXISTING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. INCLUDING AN EVALUATION MAP AT EVACUATION MAP A COMMUNITY EMERGENCY SIGNALS. TO LOOK FOR AND TO COMMON DISASTER IN THE AREA. AB THREE THREE AID REQUIRED PARK OWNERS TO ME -- TO MAKE THESE MULTI LINGUAL PLANS ASSESSABLE WAS FOR THE ENGLISH VERSION AND NOTIFIED RESIDENTS ANNUALLY HOW TO ASSESS THERE'S CRITICAL EMERGENCY INFORMATION.

AB THREE THREE EIGHT IS SPONSORED BY THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. AND ENJOYED TO SPAWN A TO SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. OF CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND GOLDEN SCARY GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURING HOME OWNERS LEAGUE AND OTHERS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY. I'M IN SUPPORT I HAVE CELLS A FIRE CHIEF ROBERSON IAN. AND ROGER JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF G. S. Â¯ RESIDENTS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. SAT CHIEF. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME IS ROBERT SERBIAN I AM THE SAN JOSE FIRE DEPARTMENT FIRE CHIEF I AM BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE EIGHT AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED -- THE CITY OF SAN JOSE IS A BILL SPONSOR -- THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KANSEN CHU FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR FIRE SAFETY. IN OUR MOBILE HOME AND MANUFACTURE HOME COMMUNITIES AND FOR TAKING ACTION. BY ADVANCING ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE THREE EIGHT ON AUGUST SEVENTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT TWELVE THIRTY THREE PM SOUNDS A FIRE DEPARTMENT RESOURCES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE GOLDEN WILL MOBILE HOME PARK. IN SAN JOSE. THIS WAS FOR A REPORTED FIRE. UPON ARRIVAL OUR FIREFIGHTERS FOUND A FULLY INVOLVED MOBILE HOME THREATENING [inaudible] NEIGHBORING HOMES. ONCE FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE TO STOP FIRE SPREAD THEY FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE AGAIN FULLY INVOLVED. MOBILE HOME. IT'S INTO THEIR FIRE ATTACK THEY WERE APPROACHED BY FAMILY MEMBERS OF THAT RESIDENTS. AND THEY WERE EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT. THREE ALL WERE UNACCOUNTED. FOR AS THE FIRE. WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND A THOROUGH SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED OF WHAT REMAINED OF THAT RESIDENCE -- WE FOUND -- AND WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THREE FATALITIES. THIS WAS ONE SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD MALE. ONE TEN YEAR OLD FEMALE. AND HER NINE YEAR OLD FEMALE FRIEND WHO WAS VISITING THE HOME. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION COULD NOT CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF A FUNCTIONING SMOKE ALARM IN THIS RESIDENTS. THE LOSSES ON THAT DAY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE OF COURSE TRAGIC. NOT ONLY FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS BUT ALSO FOR RESPONDING FIREFIGHTERS. AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE ENTIRE SENDS A COMMUNITY. BUT IT WAS ALSO A CALL TO ACTION. TO ENSURE THAT THIS TYPE OF LIFE LOS DIDN'T OCCUR AGAIN. SINCE THIS EVENT THE SENATE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH THE SILICON VALLEY AMERICAN RED CROSS. IN THEIR SOUND THE ALARM. CAMPAIGN WHICH RIGHT NOW IS FOCUSED ON INSTALLING SMOKE ALARMS AT EVERY MOBILE HOME PARK IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. WERE RESIDENTS ARE WILLING TO ALLOW US INTO THEIR HOMES TO DO THAT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO APPLIED AND WAS AWARDED FEMA GRANT FUNDING TO PURCHASE. SMOKE ALARMS IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT. THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE'VE ENCOUNTERED SOME CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY. SOME RESIDENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO REACH -- THEY HAVE LONG WORK HOURS. SOME HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS SOME HAVE DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT. SUMMER VERY NEW. RESIDENTS OF OUR CITY AND OUR COUNTRY [inaudible] AND ON VERY FEW OCCASIONS BUT BUT IN SOME OCCASIONS WE HAVE UNCOOPERATIVE PARK MANAGERS. THESE CHALLENGES NEED TO BE OVERCOME -- TO INFORM ON SAFETY FOR OUR MEMBERS -- FOR OUR RESIDENTS. AND TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR SMOKE ALARM INSTALLATIONS -- WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND MANY OF OUR OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS IS WE HAVE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS? ELDERLY AND CHILDREN. WE SEE IN THESE HOMES VERY RAPID FIRE SPREAD BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT WEEK BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THESE TYPE OF HOMES. THESE HOMES HAVE LIMITED EGRESS AND ACCESS POINTS -- AND THEY ARE SMALL SPACES THAT FILLS WITH SMOKE VERY RAPIDLY. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE EIGHT PROVIDES US WITH TWO THINGS ONE IS AT THE POINT OF TRANSACTION IT ENSURES THAT THE WORK WE'VE MADE PROGRESS ON TO INSTALL SMOKE ALARMS. IS CONTINUED TO THE NEXT OWNER OCCUPANT OF THE STRUCTURE. BUT IT ALSO HELPS US TO PENETRATE. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION FRONT -- AND ALLOW OUR NEWEST RESIDENTS OFTEN ARE IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. TO BE INFORMED ON HOW TO EXIT THEIR HOME SAFELY IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE AND HOW TO RESPOND TO OTHER EMERGENCIES. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY -- AND I PRAY FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOUR NEXT WITNESS. YES GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROGER JOHNSON. I'M A MEMBER OF IN REPRESENTING. THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE G. -- SO MORAL. GS A MORAL SUPPORT A. B.. THREE THREE EIGHT WHICH REQUIRES UP TO DATE SMOKE ALARMS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR RE INTRODUCING THIS BILL. N. DOT LAST YEAR THE STATE EXPERIENCED MORE DEVASTATING FIRES. INCLUDING [inaudible] OF THE DEVASTATION FROM THE CAMPFIRE IN PARADISE. WHERE MANYLIVES MOBILE HOMES AND ENTIRE MOBILE HOME PARKS WERE LOST? WE CANNOT BE TOO PREPARED WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIA FIRES. PROVIDING EMERGENCY MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. WILL HELP NEIGHBORS WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE PREPARE. FOR WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER HITS. THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ON THIS IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT SUPPORT THE BILL. RESEARCHER MEMBERS MADISON DAHLIA BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS AND SUPPORT WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I AM JEFF FLOCK FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS TO THE BAY AREA CHAPTER WE SUPPORT THIS WE THINK IT'S A GREAT BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF OF SAN JOSE MAYOR SAM LICCARDO IN SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD MORNING. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME UP HERE SO -- POLISH I SOMEONE WHICH I DO THIS CORRECTLY -- COMMITTEE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. UP I LIKE TO LET YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND MY BACKGROUND I'M A MEMBER OF W. MAY WESTERN MANUFACTURED. COMMITTEES ASSOCIATION -- I CURRENTLY SIT ON THEIR LEGISLATURE -- COMMITTEE AND ALSO ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. I HAVE BEEN IN THIS MANUFACTURED HOUSING I CALLED THE MOBILE HOME PARK INDUSTRY. FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS I HAVE A DEGREE. FROM CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE -- BACHELORS OF ARTS IN DEAF STUDIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON HUMAN SERVICES. AND DURING MY EXPERIENCE THE PAST TWENTY YEARS -- I'VE OPERATED PARKS FROM IN. OH SEVEN HARRIS FIRES THAT WERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEAR THE SAN DIEGO. AREA -- I'VE HAD PARKS OPERATING IN THE SAN JOSE A COUPLE YEARS BACK WHEN WE HAD THE FLOODS -- WE HAD A PROPERTY THAT -- HAD DAMAGE -- FROM THE SANTA ROSA FIRES AND ALSO YOU KNOW WENT THROUGH THE AMERICAN CANYON EARTHQUAKES. I ALSO AM A SURVIVOR OF THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE MINE WAS THE BUILDING THAT COLLAPSED. SO IS THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ME I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN HERE DIMINISHES THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS JUST THE ONES THAT I'VE MENTIONED -- THE PARADISE FIRE SO. MY COMMENTS ARE NOT TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN LIFE. AND AS THE BILL STANDS. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE SMOKE ALARMSI THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE COULD USE SOME FINE TUNING. BUT IN GENERAL THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE YOU KNOW WHAT TO HAVE SMOKE DETECTORS I THINK IT'S IT'S A GREAT IDEA. WHERE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND AGAIN IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO TO VOICE SOME CONCERN ESPECIALLY SINCE PEOPLE PUT SUCH GREAT EFFORT AND WORK INTO MAKING A BETTER PRODUCT? IS AS IT COMES. TO THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THIS CURRENT BILL THAT'S BEING PROPOSED MAKES ANY REAL CHANGE IN THE OUTCOME AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE HINDSIGHT OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY AGREES THE PARADISE FIRES WERE TERRIBLE THE SANTA ROSA FIRES WHICH I'M GOING. TO USE MORE AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE WE HAD PARKS WE WERE OPERATING AT THAT TIME IN THAT AREA. GIVES US HINDSIGHT WE KNOW THAT WHEN THE FIRE WAS NEAR THAT LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME IN. AND THEY DID BASICALLY WHAT I CALL A SOFT WARNING YOU KNOW WHAT WE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU EVACUATE WE DO ALSO KNOW THAT SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE WINDS TOOK A HORRIBLE TURN. AND THE FIRE PRETTY MUCH PUT SANTA ROSA ON FIRE AT THAT TIME EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. WHAT IT WAS A FIRE DEPARTMENT POLICE DEPARTMENT WHOEVER WAS AVAILABLE WENT THROUGH THE COMMUNITY AND BASICALLY SET GET OUT? YOU HAVE TO EVACUATE NOW THE FIRE IS COMING. AND WE CAN'T STOP IT. THAT WAS DONE IN ENGLISH EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND THEY GOT OUT I'D LIKE TO STRESS ALSO THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE. WHICH WAS BASED OFF OF THE PREVIOUS BILL. NUMBER TWO PREPARE TO SLANT IN PLACE IT'S A FORTY TWO ALL RESIDENTS AT ANY TIME WHEN THEY WANT THEY WANTED BUT IT'S ALSO AFFORDED ANNUALLY. IT'S POSTED IN THE COMMUNITY SOMEWHERE VISIBLE THAT THEY CAN GET TO IT ANY TIMES IT'S NOT LOCKED AWAY IN AN OFFICE IT'S ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE. SO WE HAVE THE HEINZ LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WORKED. MY CONCERNED WITH THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES IN AGAIN IT TAKES US AWAY FROM THE THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TRANSLATE IT NOW. I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME BACK AND FORTH AS FAR WELL WHAT WE MAY JUST HAVE A CERTAIN PORTION TRANSLATED THAT'S MORE UNIFORM. THERE WHILE PROXIMATE LEE WHAT FORTY ONE HUNDRED MOBILE HOME PARKS. IN CALIFORNIA. CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE FORTY ONE HUNDRED EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS. EVERY PARK OPERATOR. HAS THE BASIS OF WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED BUT SOME LIKE THE COMPANY I WORK. FOR PROVIDE A LOT MORE INFORMATION SO OUR DOCKING COULD BE FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE PAGES LONG. WE PROVIDE EVERYTHING IN ENGLISH ENGLISH IS THE PURPOSE FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I CAN WRITE SOMETHING UP AND I COULD TELL YOU WHAT MY INTENT AND WHAT IT MEANS. THE MORE MOVIES ARE GOING TO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. A PERSON LIVING IN A COMMUNITY COULD REASONABLY EXPECT WHY ARE WE STOPPING HERE WHY ARE YOU THAT PROVIDING ALL THESE OTHER. DOCUMENTS IN THAT LANGUAGE. THAT THAT IS A VERY BIG CONCERN FOR US THAT IT'S A VALID POINT THAT COULD BE MADE IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE DON'T DO. WE HAVE FOR THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ANY OF OUR DOCUMENTS AND HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED ON THEIR OWN BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY. OF IT -- I'VE I HAVE ANOTHER CONCERN AS TO HOW EXACTLY IS THIS GOING TO BE MANAGED OBVIOUSLY THE STATE TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY IS A GREAT. BUT AS I UNDERSTAND EIGHT CD WOULD BE ACCEPTING THIS ROLE WE JUST HAD A BILL THAT WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. WHERE WE UNDERSTAND EIGHTY HAS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB TO DO THEY HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHENEVER SOMETHING NEW IS CREATED IT'S KIND OF COOL WOULD JUST GIVE IT TO A CD? I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE HAVE EVER TRIED TO CALL EIGHT CD OR DO A TITLE TRANSFER THOSE THINGS TAKE A VERY LONG TIME SO. IN GENERAL I HAVE. A LOT OF CONCERN AS TO THE TRANSLATION PROCESS IF IT'S ONLY A PORTION. IT IS VERY REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE COME BACK AND SAY WELL. WHY ARE YOU ONLY TRANSLATING THIS PORTION FOR US WHY ARE YOU NOT TRANSLATING THE REST OF THE DOCUMENT? I I SPEAK SPANISH I CAN READ SPANISH BUT IF SOMEONE SENT ME A DOCUMENT ASSISTED WE GOT THIS TRANSLATED FOR YOU AND IT'S IN VIETNAMESE. I HAVE NO IDEA. WHETHER THAT'S BEING DONE CORRECTLY BUT I DO KNOW THAT AS AN OPERATOR WE'RE GONNA BE HELD TO A BAR. THIS SAYS EVERYTHING THAT'S HERE. YES FROM THE PARK IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED AS WHAT IT IS SO IT PRESENTS A LOGISTICAL ISSUES JUST IN. GENERAL THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IN READING THE BILL IS. IT'S ONLY LIMITED TO OUR INDUSTRY MOBILE HOME PARKS. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS A LAYPERSON I'M NOT A LOBBYIST I'M JUST A LAY PERSON. WHAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS? DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IDEAS ORIGINAL INTENT IN HIS SB TWENTY THREE WAS TO PROVIDE EVACUATION ROUTES PROVIDE BASIC EMERGENCY. INFORMATION BUT IT WAS NEVER HIS INTENT TO CREATE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR PHYSICAL EVACUATION. AND EMPHASIZED [inaudible] PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IT BY TO UNDERSTAND THAT. MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE BEING VIEWED DIFFERENTLY THAT THERE CAN'T. MANAGE THESE THINGS ON THEIR OWN AS IT STANDS AS WE ALREADY PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION SO I FIND A LITTLE DISCONCERTING THAT. APARTMENT THE CONDOMINIUMS AND SO FORTH ONE INCLUDED IN THAT. BUT WITH THAT SAID -- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY IN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SPEAKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. LET'S BRING IT BACK FOR COMMITTEE DISCUSSION COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] MR BUSTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THIS IS GERMAN I I'M READING YOUR AT YOUR ANALYSIS HERE ON THIS BILL AND AND AND I WANT TO SAY THAT -- COMING FROM. A A COMING FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT BACKGROUND WITH MANY MANY A MOBILE HOME -- PARKS -- IN IN IN IN. IN MY CITY AND THEN ALSO IN IN MY DISTRICT -- I AM VERY -- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CHOOSE DOING A WE HAD THE SAME. ISSUE IN NGUYEN WAS CENSORED LAST YEAR WHEN IT COMES -- TO TO LANGUAGE BERIA AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WORK THAT OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT WAS JUST ONE CITY AND AND IF YOU PARKS -- I DO WANNA AS MISTER CHAIRMAN I I DO WHEN ASKED. IF THE THE AUTHOR WOULD CONSIDER -- A A SMALL AMENDMENT BECAUSE IN IN HIS BILL. OF IF IF PASS OR SIGN TO LAW WOULD REQUIRE -- EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN TO BE TRANSLATED. IN LANGUAGES THAT MEETS THE MEDI CAL -- DRESSEL BUT ALSO -- IN ANY LANGUAGE THAT. IS REQUEST EVEN BY ONE RESIDENT -- WE WE HAVE. WE WE WE KNOW THERE'S MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. WE IS THE STATE PROVIDES A TRANSLATION TO INCLUDING BEANIES ARE DOLLAR BECAUSE SPANISH. MANDARIN KOREANS AND AND SO ON SO ON AND I THINK ALL THOSE LANGUAGES. MEETTHE MEDI CAL TO WRESTLE BUT IF IF IF YOUR BILL AS AS WRITTEN. IF THERE'S JUST. ONE ONE ONE ONE TENANT. THAT SPEAKS OF A VERY -- THAT THAT THE SIX THE LET LANGUAGE THAT. NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. USED THE THAT I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD PUT. A LOT OF BURDEN ON ON THE PARK OWNER IF THIS IF IT'S JUST ONE TEN AND REQUIRING. ONE ONE LANGUAGE SOUL MISTER CHAIRMAN I I DON'T KNOW IF IF THE AUTHOR WOULD CONSIDER -- TIGHTEN THAT UP A LITTLE BIT SO THAT. ONE PERSON CAN'T JUST COME IN THERE AND SAID HEY. HELLO I MEAN I I DON'T WANT TO THROW IT A A RANDOM LANGUAGE OUT THERE -- TO THE TO TO SOUND MEAN OR OR AND DISRESPECTFUL TO TO THAT PARTICULAR. OF CULTURE OR LANGUAGE BUT BUT WOULD HE CONSIDER TIED THAT UP WHERE WE DO HAVE A CUT OFF EDGES. MEDI CAL IN WHICH TO ALL OF THE AUTHOR IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU. FOR YOUR AGREED WITH THE LANGUAGES SAYS ABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT -- REGARDING. TO YOUR ROOM US FOR MEDI CAL THRESHOLD LANGUAGES OR JUST ONE SINGLE REQUIRE US. TO BURDEN WILL BE ON THE EACH CD US NOT TO GO TO A PARK OPERATOR. SO DO A DAY CAN REQUIRE US TO A SPEECH CD TO DO THE TRANSLATION. AND THEN -- I'M POSTED ON ON THEIR OWN TO WEBSITE OR YOU ARE ARE -- MELDED TO DUMB AND AND THEIR LANGUAGE. SO. AT THIS POINT -- I LIKE TO HAVE A BROADER COVERAGE. YOU KNOW -- MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS SO WE DON'T HAVE WHAT DID THE H. C. NEVER RECEIVE ANY REQUIRES. AND WILL PROBABLY CAN NARROW DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BUT BECAUSE OF THE THE MOBILE HOME THE STRUCTURE LIKE THIS CHIEF MENTION OF THE MOBILE HOME AND THE TIGHT SPACE. YOU KNOW THEY HELP IN THE MOBILE HOME PARK. WE WANTED TO REALLY. PREVENT ANY. FOR AS FIRES AND A MOBILE HOME PARK AS POSSIBLE THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN EASILY SPREAD TO YOUR NEIGHBORS. AND ALSO DATED TO THE TIED TO BEFORE YOU DON'T. KNOW THE EVACUATION PLAN IF YOU DON'T KNOW DE IT THERE TO DO THE EMERGENCY SIGNAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT. SO WE DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE. ANYBODY AT THIS POINT. IT'S YOU KNOW LIKE I SAY DUE TO FIRE CAN SPREAD BROUGH REAL QUICKLY A PEN IT'LL CAN I CLARIFY THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT IS. IS THE IS A BURDEN ON ON THE ON THE PARK OWNER OR ON ON THE TENANT TO REQUEST -- THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN. IN IN IN IN A PARTICULAR LANGUAGE. OF WITH A CD AND OR OR OR LIKE WHO LIKE WHO'S WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR MAKING THAT. THAT REQUEST AND THE CONTACT -- AS I READ THE BILL THAT THE RESIN IS -- WOULD MAKE THE REQUEST -- OF THE PARK OWNER. AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR TERM MAKE I REQUEST A CD. RIGHT. YEAH AND AND AND AND AND AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S MY THAT'S JUST MY SMALL CONCERT WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT. IT WILL IT WILL PULL THE PARK OWNER -- INTO. SOMEWHAT OF A YOU KNOW LIKE A LENGTHY PROCESS WE ALL KNOW THAT A THE STATE BUREAUCRACY IS NOT THE EASIEST OF PLACER THE A TO WORK WITHIN. THE LAST MY CONCERN THAT WE WE WE WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE A A CUT OFF WRESTLE ANYWHERE IS IS ANYBODY CAN COME IN WITH. WITH A WITH A DIALECT THAT -- NO ONE USE EXCEPT THAT PARTICULAR ATTENDED AND THEN THE UNDER THIS LAW. THE OF THE THE PARK OWNER HAVE TO PUT IN A REQUEST WITH THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT -- OR HOW THE COMMUNITY APARTMENT JUST FOR JUST FOR THAT ONE PLAN FILL OUT. OF MY CONCERT WITH THIS BILL IT OVERALL I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE IT. IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IS ACTUALLY IN GENERAL NEEDED. IF I CAN -- THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT I'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THE AUTHOR THIS BILL FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND COLLEAGUES YOU MAY REMEMBER WE ACTUALLY VOTED TO PASS THIS BILL OUT -- IT WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WAS AGREED UPON BY THE LEGISLATURE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND WAS VETOED -- IN PART OVER THESE ISSUES I THINK WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THE ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT WOULD IMPROVE -- REQUIREMENTS AROUND SMOKE DETECTORS OR SOMETHING I DON'T THINK ANYONE DISPUTES AND I THINK EVERYONE WOULD ALSO AGREE THAT. ENSURE LANGUAGE ACCESS IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT -- I DO KNOW THAT -- THE CONVERSATION THAT THE AUTHORS HAVING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS AROUND HOW TO DO THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS THAT OUR COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED TO HELP STREAMLINE THAT AND ESSENTIALLY. WHAT WE PROPOSED WAS FOR THE COMMON ELEMENTS OF ALL OF THESE EMERGENCY PLANS THAT THAT BE PRE TRANSLATED SO THAT WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL EVERY TIME -- BUT THE BILL DOES ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUE TRANSLATION INTO THE LANGUAGES THAT ARE REQUIRED OF OTHER ASPECTS OF THAT AND I DO KNOW THAT IS A ISSUE. I THINK AS I DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR JUST YESTERDAY THIS IS A TOPIC THAT I KNOW HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND CONSIDER THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT I DO THINK AT THIS POINT -- THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE ON ON THESE PROVISIONS -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS MAKES SENSE FOR FOR ME TO SUPPORT AND WITH THAT I HAVE THAT RECOMMENDATION BUT THE ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. IF THERE ISN'T I WILL ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMITTEE LIKE TO MAKE. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU ARE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I BOTH -- I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR SOME OF THE OF MOBILE HOME OWNERS OPERATORS -- A HOUSE A MORE EXTENSIVE POPE BOCA -- EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS FOR A A DOCUMENT.

THAT BILLS OUT WILL WAIT FOR ANNA MEMBERS AND THEN WE HAVE ONE FINAL ITEM AND THAT IS MIND WHICH IS FILE ITEM ONE A. B.. TEN AND IN TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN OF A YOU I MEAN OPEN [inaudible] FOR OPENING STATEMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB TEN WHICH WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF OUR STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT -- I'LL JUST NOTE THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS THE VERY FIRST BILL I EVER INTRODUCED WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE NOW FIVE YEARS AGO. IT IS THE ONLY BILL THAT I'VE INTRODUCED EVERY YEAR -- AND I WANT TO FIRST THANK ALL OF MOST OF YOU HAVE VOTED FOR THIS THIS BILL HAS ENJOYED UNANIMOUS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. IT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND PART OF THE REASON WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK WAS. THEN CANDIDATE NOW GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA OF EXPANDING -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HIM AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR PROPOSING THE EXACT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION THAT WE ARE PROPOSING. A AND I WANT TO THANK THE COALITION THAT HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- TIRELESSLY FOR MANY YEARS -- I DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THE INTENSITY OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND I THINK THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WELL. HOW MUCH AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION WE LOST IN STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHEN PASSED BOND MONIES DRIED UP? I AND REDEVELOPMENT WENT AWAY. THIS IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE REMARKABLY. EFFECTIVE OVER THE YEARS IT LEVERAGES AT LEAST TWO TO ONE DOLLAR SO AND EIGHT AND INVESTMENT OF A NEW HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WOULD RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL. BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL AND LOCAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING. THIS IS A TAX CREDIT THAT IS HIGHLY OVERSUBSCRIBED THE DEMAND FROM OUR MANY DISTRICTS -- IS VERY INTENSE AND AND THIS WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS AT I WOULD ALSO MENTION -- THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE RECENT -- TRUMP TAX PLAN WHICH WE ALL KNOW REDUCED THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% 221%. THAT HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF THIS TAX CREDIT ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL -- THAT WE HAVE ADDED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AFTER THAT TAX PLAN CHANGE WAS TO ELIMINATE THE CURRENT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS OFFSET. FOR PASSIVE RENTAL REAL ESTATE ACTIVITIES WHAT THAT WILL ALLOW IS FOR THIS TAX CREDIT TO ACTUALLY BE MORE VALUABLE TO REALLY OFFSET THE IMPACT SO WITH THAT A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING TYRONE BUCKLEY WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS THE NONPROFIT AD ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FIGHTING FOR THE MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING. THE MOST TO AFFORD OUR STATES -- INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE RENTS -- WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL AGAIN -- AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS TIRELESS -- EFFORT TO GET THIS DONE HOUSING PRICES ARE DRIVING COSTS OF LIVING OUT OF REACH FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE AS A RESULT ONE IN THREE HOUSEHOLDS KONAMI BASIC NEEDS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO LATEST REPORTS THAT DESPITE THE PASSAGE OF RECENT LISTED LEGISLATION IN BONDS. STATE FUNNY TODAY REMAINS WELL BELOW TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE LEVELS UNDERMINING PROGRESS AND INJURIES ADDRESSING WHAT IS NOW WELL RECOGNIZED AS A HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE. ASSEMBLY BILL -- TEN AS MENTIONED WILL WILL EXPAND THE TAXPAYER PROGRAM BY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- WHICH WE THINK IS KEY AND CORPS -- AS AS AS A MEMBER CHU NOTED -- THE IT'S A SMART PROPOSAL THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE INVESTMENT -- BUT TO AND TO SOLVE AND GET DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN ADDITION -- THIS IS GOING TO DRAW DOWN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LEAVING ON THE TABLE AND BEEN LEAVING ON THE TABLE FOR YEARS. SO -- HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE ARE DR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM. THE STATE AND FEDERAL TAX CREDITS ARE TO THE MOST IMPORTANT HOUSING PRODUCTION PROGRAMS WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY FOR THEY ALLOW PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EQUITY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. SO THIS BILL IN EXPANDING THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT AND IN MAKING IMPORTANT STATUTORY CHANGES TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE CREDIT WHEN IT'S PAIRED WITH. EXEMPT BONDS BRINGS A A LARGE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO THE TABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS -- MY COLLEAGUE SAID HAS BEEN LEFT ON THE TABLE IN THE PAST. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE VERY HAPPY TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL ENERGY RIVAL. THANK YOU -- ANY SUPPORTERS OF FOR THIS BILL JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION.

HEARING SEEING NONE -- IS CHAIRMAN YOU MAY CLOSE. I HOPE THIS LAST TIME I PRESENTED FOR DISCONNECT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GIVER. I JUST WANTED -- TO IT'S THANK OUR CHAIRMAN FOR HIS TENACITY AND HIS LEADERSHIP I THINK THIS IS -- IMPORTANT -- PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL BECAUSE OF THIS BILL AND JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS FORWARD AND GLAD TO SEE THAT -- OUR NEW GOVERNOR'S ALSO SUPPORTER OF IT AND JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. ANY OF SOME WOMEN GLORIA -- ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MR GABRIEL AND I'LL JUST ASK -- IN TERMS OF THAT -- GREATER CAPACITY THAT ARE GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT OF OF WHICH I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN TERMS OF THE INCOME THRESHOLD -- THAT ARE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNOR VERSES THIS BILL CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY YOU'RE GOING A DIFFERENT WAY THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S ASK. FOR WELL THIS -- THIS IS A BILL THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD PROPOSED IN DECEMBER BEFORE -- THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED HIS BUDGET AND I THINK CERTAINLY THE NEED UP AND DOWN THE INCOME SCALE IS -- IS IS VERY INTENSE AND WHAT MISTER GORE IS REFERRING TO IS A MISTER NEWSOME IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL -- PROPOSE THAT A PORTION OF THE TAX CREDIT -- BE FOCUSED ON MORE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING SO ABOVE LOW AND VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS -- THE GOVERNOR ACTUALLY IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL NOT ONLY PROPOSES MORE MODERATE INCOME ASPECTS OF THE TAX CREDIT BUT HE ALSO I THINK. HAD ANOTHER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THAT HE PROPOSED THAT ALSO GO TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND SO. WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW ON EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE BEST LOVERS TO USE BOTH TO ADDRESS THE NEED. AT LOWER INCOME LEVELS AS WELL AS IN THE MODERATE INCOME SIDE -- AND THAT DISCUSSION IS ON GOING SO I THINK FOR NOW WE LIKE THE PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE AS IT IS BUT WE'LL SEE HOW THIS INVOLVES -- IN THE COMING MONTHS. I APPRECIATED OPEN THIS MEANS I THINK OBVIOUSLY TAXPAYERS SUBSIDY SHOULD GO TO THE LOWEST INCOME PEOPLE WILL KNOW PRESUMABLY HOPEFULLY -- OF FOLKS WHO WORK FULL TIME DON'T NEED PUBLIC SUBSIDY IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET THAT'S NOT SO THE REALITY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY -- I'M SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY I HOPE THIS CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT -- MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING I CERTAINLY WHEN I GET THE MOST -- FEEDBACK ABOUT IN TERMS OF MY CONSTITUENCY -- AND WHETHER THAT IS -- REGULATORY REFORM OR OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT OF A PRIME THE PUMP UP THE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING AGAIN THAT'S NOT SUBSIDIZED I THINK THAT'S PHILOSOPHICALLY WHY I PREFER TO SEE. I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT WE INCREASINGLY SEE THE NEED TO SUBSIDIZE UP 210020% YEAH I MEAN INCOME. AND THERE'S PROBABLY WATCH TWO REASONS IT OR OF LONGER TERM PLACES WE NEED DO IN THE SHORT TERM -- YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATIONS THE PORCINE HARDENS UP -- AS WE BECAUSE OF THE TALENTS THAT PROCESS THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU I'LL JUST MENTION TWO OTHER THINGS. WHEN IT COMES TO TRADITIONAL FOR WHAT HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS -- FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS -- THAT TAX MATCH IS THERE WHERE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THERE -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO MATCH THAT 1810020% A MIND SO -- THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND -- FOR FOR THAT RANGE GOES FARTHER AND SO THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE WANTED TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION BUT THAT BEING SAID. I THINK THERE IS A VERY VALID CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE -- YOU AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER ANOTHER BILL THAT WE WILL BE PRESENTING IN THIS COMMITTEE -- TO HOPEFULLY MOVE FORWARD -- ADDITIONAL TAX RELIEF FOR PRODUCTION THAT AREA I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTE HAVE TO TACKLE I AND THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE CRISIS IS IMPACTING ALL. PARTS OF THE INCOME SPECTRUM AND WE'VE GOT TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE THE SMARTEST AND MOST AFFECTED PROPOSALS IN EACH CATEGORY. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
