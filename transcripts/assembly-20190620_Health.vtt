01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.499
BY A MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT KERR

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.767
IN THE BAY AREA LAST SPRING.

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.302
WHEN UNPACKS THE CHILD WAS

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.471
INFECTED WITH MEASLES IN EUROPE

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.939
AND RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA WITH

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.007
THE DISEASE?

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:26.675
THAT CHILD THEN TRANSMIT THE

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:28.110
DISEASE TO OTHER UNVACCINATED

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:29.911
CHILDREN INCLUDING A FAMILY WHO

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.646
LIED TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:32.314
THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.315
VACCINATED.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.649
IN TRUTH THIS FAMILY HAD

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.084
PURCHASED INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.886
EXEMPTIONS FROM A PHYSICIAN

HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY.

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:40.789
BECAUSE THEY LIED.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:41.990
THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS DO NOT

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.159
FOLLOW UP UNTIL THEY DISCOVERED

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.294
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.362

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:48.964
WHO HAD CONTACT WITH THESE EXAMS

TO THIS FAMILY?

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.969
AT HAVING HAD MEDICAL EXEMPTION

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.237
INFORMATION COULD HAVE PREVENTED

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:56.738
FURTHER SPREAD DISEASE BECAUSE

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.873
THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:59.074
WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT THE

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.243
CHILDREN WERE IN VACCINATED.

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:03.211
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CLARIFY

ISSUING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.430
MANY OF THE REASONS ON THE LIST

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:24.032
STRAIN CREDULITY CLEANING

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:25.400
SOMETHING LIKE HAIR LOSS.

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:26.635
LET'S BE CLEAR THE FEDERAL

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:27.402
ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:28.904
IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES COMPOSED

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.105
OF NATIONAL EXPERTS ON

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:31.807
INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND VACCINE

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.341

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:34.509
FROM SEVERAL VACCINE SAFETY

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.478
MODERN PROGRAMS TO ISSUE THE CDC

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.580
CONTRA INDICATIONS OF

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.148
PRECAUTIONS TO VACCINATIONS.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.184
SECOND THE OPPOSITION HAD

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.785
FALSELY CLAIMED THAT POSITIONS

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:45.120
HAD NOT BEEN FOUND TO BE IT TO

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.388
BE BE ISSUING FAKE MEDICAL

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.023
EXEMPTIONS AND IN FACT CITED A

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.124
PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.659
PEDIATRICS THAT INCLUDES MEDICAL

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:51.393
BOARD DATA.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.028
THAT NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS HAD

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.796
BEEN DISMISSED BY THE BOARD.

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:55.630
NOW IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:56.731
PAPER THE PAPER ACTUALLY

01:18:56.798 --> 01:18:58.100
REPORTED THE COUNTY HEALTH

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.668
OFFICERS WERE FRUSTRATED.

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:00.669
BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THERE ARE

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:02.170
MANY AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.371
EXEMPTIONS HOWEVER WERE

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:05.273
POWERLESS TO STOP THEM SINCE THE

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.408
EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY WENT TO THE

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.542
SCHOOLS AND EIGHT AND RECEIVE

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:08.577

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:10.779
IN ADDITION THEY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.614
THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES HAD NO

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:14.249
LEGAL AUTHORITY NOT TO ACCEPT

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.917
THE EXEMPTIONS EVEN WHEN THEY

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.152
KNEW THEY WERE PROBLEMATIC.

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.854
SECOND THE MEDICAL BOARD IS

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.155
BEING STYMIED.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.823
BY IT BECAUSE PARENTS PURCHASING

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.024
INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:25.827
ARE OBSTRUCTING INVESTIGATIONS

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.329
BY REFUSING TO GIVE THE BOARD

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:28.597
ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS SO

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.499
CASES ARE BEING DROPPED BECAUSE

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:32.200
THE BOARDS AND ABLE TO CONDUCT

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.969

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:35.704
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER BOB SEARS

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.139
WHO HAS BEEN PUT ON PROBATION BY

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.773

APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.309
ONLY THIS ONLY OCCURRED WHEN A

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:42.511
PARENT COOPERATED WITH THE

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:45.013
MEDICAL BOARD.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.348
IN ADDITION THE MEDICAL BOARD

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.016
RECENTLY WON AN APPEALS COURT

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.384

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:51.920

VACCINATION AND QUOTE.

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:03.064
BUT DESPITE THIS EFFORT SO FAR

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.399
THE MEDICAL BOARD IS STILL

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.534

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:38.318
FILLED WITH MYSTERY ILLNESS I

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.686
WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:41.622
PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY ALONG

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:43.123
WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS.

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:45.125
AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:47.294
SEVERE VACCINE REACTIONS ALONG

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.462
THE WAY.

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:50.163
THESE IMMUNE DISORDERS AREN'T AS

01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.932
EASY TO DIAGNOSIS SENATOR PAN

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.467
HAS SUGGESTED IN PREVIOUS

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:54.401
HEARINGS.

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:55.836
AND THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY THE

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.204
NEARLY DEFINED LIST OF CONTRA

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:59.072
INDICATIONS THAT ARE THE

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.374
CORNERSTONE OF THIS FILM.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.442
I HAVE FIVE YEAR OLD TWINS WHO

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:04.711
HAVE HAD. TO HAVE A HIGH

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:07.080
LIKELIHOOD OF INHERITING SOME OR

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:10.984
ALL OF MY IMMUNE DISORDERS.

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.486
THEY HAVE ALSO HAD SEVERE.

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:13.987
VACCINE REACTIONS THAT MIMICKED

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:16.823
THE REACTIONS I'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.692
WE HAVE CONSULTED HIGHLY TRAINED

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:20.294
CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGISTS

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.529
RHEUMATOLOGIST AND PEDIATRICIANS

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:24.097
INNER CONSENSUS AS THAT IT WOULD

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:26.500
BE TOO RISKY TO KEEP VACCINATING

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:27.601
MY CHILDREN.

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:30.037
DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF SEVERE

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:31.171
VACCINE REACTIONS.

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:32.472
WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VALID

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.107
VACCINE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE NOT

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:35.275
FRAUDULENT.

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.044
OUR UNIQUE MEDICAL SCENARIO DOES

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.712
NOT FIT WITHIN THE NARROW

01:43:38.779 --> 01:43:41.915
DEFINED LIST OF CONTRIBUTIONS

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:42.215
[inaudible]

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:43.850
IT IS.

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:46.019
IT IS NOT LEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:47.454
AGAINST THE LESS THAN 1% OF

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:50.190
CHILDREN WITH LEGITIMATE VACCINE

01:43:50.257 --> 01:43:51.592
EXEMPTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO AN

01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:53.994
EDUCATION DUE TO FAMILY HISTORY

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.996
OR A MEDICAL DISORDER THAT IS

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:57.164
OUT OF THEIR CONTROL.

01:43:57.230 --> 01:43:58.832
FAMILIES WITH IMMUNE DISORDERS

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:00.167
OR THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:02.569
VACCINE REACTION REACTIONS.

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:03.870
SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:05.539
AGAINST IMAGINE WHAT MY

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.441
CHILDREN'S EDUCATION WOULD LOOK

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:09.476
LIKE IF I WAS FORCED TO HOME

01:44:09.543 --> 01:44:11.011
SCHOOL.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.346
THEM BETWEEN DOCTOR VISITS

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:15.148
HOSPITAL STAYS MEDICAL

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.050
PROCEDURES AND ILLNESSES.

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:20.020
LASTLY IT APPEARS THAT THE

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:21.888
CURRENT AMENDMENTS MADE PROVIDE

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.857
PROTECTION FOR FAMILIES LIKE MY

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:25.726
OWN BY CONSIDERING FAMILY

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.127
MEDICAL HISTORY.

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:30.297
HOWEVER I REMAIN CONCERNED. FOR

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:31.765
INSTANCE DOCTORS WRITING

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:32.933
LEGITIMATE.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.101
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS CAN BE

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.869
UNFAIRLY TARGETED AND PUNISHED

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.004
BY THE FIVE OR MORE EXEMPTION

01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:40.207

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:41.942
ALL OF THE DOCTORS VACCINE

EXEMPTIONS TO BE REVIEWED

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:44.778
IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT

RESPECTFULLY THERE'S A LOT OF

01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:59.439
MISINFORMATION.

01:47:59.506 --> 01:48:01.007
ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:03.176
DOES NOT DO.

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:04.177

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.884
ON WITH THIS BILL.

01:48:28.635 --> 01:48:30.804
THIS LAW.

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.672
IS UNPRECEDENTED.

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:34.374
IT TAKES THE STATE GOVERNMENT

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.376
AND PUTS IT SQUARELY INTO THE

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:37.677
CENTER OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:39.512
RELATIONSHIP AND IT GOES ONE

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.047
STEP FURTHER.

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:43.083
IT GIVES A STATE ACTOR THE RIGHT

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:46.052
TO BAN BLOCK COUNTERMANDED DENY

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.654
AND REVOKE.

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.789
YOUR LICENSED AND MY LICENSE

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:53.426
DECISIONS THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED

01:48:53.493 --> 01:48:55.762
TERRITORY EVEN AS AMENDED THAT

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:57.097
THAT IS WHAT'S DONE HERE.

01:48:57.163 --> 01:48:58.465
THE ISSUE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IN

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.767
MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES IS NOT

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:03.303
IF THE STATE GETS IT WRONG.

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:04.671
IT'S WHEN THE STATE GETS IT

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:05.438
WRONG.

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:07.173
BECAUSE ANY OF US EVEN A GOOD

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.909
PHYSICIAN WOULD BE HARD PRESSED

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.343
TO SIT IN FRONT OF A STACK OF

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:11.778
THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF PAPER

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:12.846
SINGLE SHEETS OF PAPER MEDICAL

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:13.813
EXEMPTIONS.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:14.981
AND WITHOUT EVER HAVING LAID

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:16.816
EYES ON THE PATIENT WITHOUT EVER

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.518
HAVING DONE A PHYSICAL EXAM OR

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.153
TEST ON THE PATIENT.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.856
GET THAT ANALYSIS RIGHT.

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.591
I DON'T THINK THE PERSON ABOVE

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:25.659
COULD GET IT RIGHT IF YOU WERE

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.394
HERE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.396
I COULD OR ANY STATE ACTOR COULD.

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:31.831
AND WHEN NOT GO SIDE WAYS AND IT

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:32.899
WILL.

01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:35.035
AND THEY MAKE A BAD DECISION AND

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.771
A LEGITIMATE A LEGITIMATE.

01:49:37.837 --> 01:49:40.140
VALID MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:42.142
REVOKED AND THE CHILD WANTS TO

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.510
STAY IN SCHOOL AND GETS

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:47.180
VACCINATED AND THAT CHILD DIES.

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.316
WHAT HAPPENS THEN THAT IS THE

01:49:49.382 --> 01:49:52.052
QUESTION AND UNDER TWO SEVENTY

01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:53.920
SIX UNDER SB TWO SEVENTY SIX THE

01:49:53.987 --> 01:49:57.324
ANSWER IS NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:59.092
BECAUSE STATE ACTORS HAVE

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:00.327
ABSOLUTE?

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:03.697
GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY.

01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:46.806
THAT IS TERRITORY NO MATTER WHAT

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:47.941
THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE TRYING TO

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:48.808
SOLVE HERE TODAY.

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:50.343
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE IN

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.078
THE MIDDLE OF NOBODY IN THIS

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:53.880

WEEKS LATER FROM A STATE ACTOR

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.287
AFTER THEIR NAME IN THE DOCTOR'S

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:02.322

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:03.423

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.761
ONCE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD IT IS

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:09.662
A SLIPPERY SLOPE IT'S A ONE WAY

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:11.197

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.725
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS LONG

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.960
BEEN A CHAMPION OF PRIVACY AND

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:42.228
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THROUGH LAWS

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.630

THIS PROCESS. TO REQUEST AN EMMY

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:02.449
A PARENT MUST FIRST AGREE TO

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:03.249
RELEASE HER CHILD'S MEDICAL

CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD.

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:09.322
THIS IS AN AFFRONT TO HIPAA THE

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:10.290
FEDERAL LAW THAT PROTECTS

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:12.258
MEDICAL INFORMATION AND IT AND

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:13.126
RUN AROUND FOR BUG WHICH

01:52:13.193 --> 01:52:15.595
PREVENTS SCHOOLS FROM RELEASING

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:17.130
STUDENTS PRIVATE INFORMATION.

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:19.065

THERE IS NO VALID REASON FOR

THESE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS VACCINE

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:33.213
EXEMPTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF SCHOOLS

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:35.782
AND THERE'S NO HISTORY OF

THE VACCINATION.

THE SECRETARY HAS THE FINAL WORD.

01:53:18.424 --> 01:53:19.425
CHILDREN WILL HAVE THEIR MEDICAL

WITH RESPECT TO SB TWO SEVENTY

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:33.506
SIX REQUIREMENT THE D. O. H.

01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:34.941
REVIEW REPORTS FROM SCHOOL TO

01:53:35.008 --> 01:53:36.209
IDENTIFY SCHOOLS WITH THE LOWER

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.611
THAN 95% VACCINATION RATE THIS

01:53:38.678 --> 01:53:40.847
IS REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICAL

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:42.348
EXEMPTION RATE IN THOSE SCHOOLS.

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:44.751
THAT RATE IS LESS THAN 1% STATE

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:46.886
WIDE IT CREATES AN UNNECESSARY

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:48.588
FINANCIAL AND TIME BURDEN ON

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:49.956
BOTH THE STATE AND THE SCHOOLS.

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:51.224
AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE REAL

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.358
REASONS THAT SOME SCHOOLS ARE

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:54.527
BELOW THAT 95% RATE.

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:56.529
APPROXIMATELY 20% OF SCHOOLS ARE

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.498
CLASSIFIED AS NOT UP TO DATE OR

01:53:58.565 --> 01:53:59.999
BANAL BELOW 95%.

01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:02.402
BUT 92% OF THOSE SCHOOLS HAVE

01:54:02.468 --> 01:54:04.003
FEWER THAN FOUR MEDICAL

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:06.172
EXEMPTIONS IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:08.708
MORE THAN HALF HAVE.

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:10.076
ZERO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:10.743
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE NOT

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.478
UP TO DATE SCHOOLS.

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:13.980
THOSE NUMBERS ARE LOWER BECAUSE

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:15.348
A CONDITIONAL ENTRANCE AN

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.883
OVERDUE STUDENTS STUDENTS HAVE

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:18.751
NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDICAL

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:20.053
EXEMPTIONS.

01:54:20.119 --> 01:54:21.287
AND WHAT ABOUT INVESTIGATING

01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:22.822
DOCTORS WHO WRITE MORE THAN FIVE

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.023
EMMYS PER YEAR.

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.458
THIS ARBITRARY NUMBER APPEARS TO

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:26.759
ARISE FROM.

01:54:26.826 --> 01:54:28.127
A BASELESS ASSUMPTION THE

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.395
DOCTORS WHO WRITE ENEMIES ARE

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:31.397
ENGAGING IN UNPROFESSIONAL OR

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:32.966
FRAUDULENT CONDUCT.

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:34.567
IT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR

01:54:34.634 --> 01:54:35.902
PEDIATRIC SPECIALISTS WHO TREAT

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:38.037
VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND IT FAILS

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:38.705
TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT

01:54:38.771 --> 01:54:41.007
PRACTICE SIZES. FOR EXAMPLE YOUR

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.875
CEILING IS FIVE REGARDLESS OF

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:43.943
WHETHER THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:45.578
CHILDREN IN YOUR PRACTICE OR TWO

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:47.213
THOUSAND OR TEN THOUSAND DOCTORS

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.948
MAY BE FORCED TO PICK PATIENTS

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:50.717
AGAINST EACH OTHER IN WEIGHING.

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:51.918
WHO SHOULD RECEIVE ONE OF THESE

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:54.254
FEW COVETED EXEMPTIONS IN ORDER

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.389
TO PROTECT THEIR PRACTICES?

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:57.056
AND NOT WITHSTANDING CLAIMS AN

01:54:57.123 --> 01:54:58.524
UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS ARE

01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:00.293
SELLING EXEMPTIONS DESPITE

DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS THE

CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD HAS NOT

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:04.497
DISCIPLINED A SINGLE.

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:10.136
BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EARLIER

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:11.671
TESTIMONY THAT THE BOARD HAS

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.206
AVAILABLE TO IT MEANS TO OBTAIN

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:14.741
MEDICAL RECORDS IF THEY FEEL

01:55:14.807 --> 01:55:16.209
THEY NEED TO DO THAT.

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:18.478
MANY OF THE POSITIONS THAT SB

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:18.978

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.488
THEY KEEP UP ON EMERGING SCIENCE

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:30.857
CENTERED DECISIONS.

01:55:30.923 --> 01:55:33.293
BASED ON PRECISION MEDICINE IT

01:55:33.359 --> 01:55:34.861
WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO THIS

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:36.195
STATE TO ITS POSITIONS AND ITS

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:37.830

PROFESSIONAL CODE WHICH

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:47.373
RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF

PROTECTING DOCTORS IN THE

FOREFRONT OF MEDICINE.

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:52.312

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:54.681
BACKWARDS FROM PRECISION PATIENT

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.916

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES.

01:56:11.197 --> 01:56:13.066
THIS BILL WILL SCARE DOCTORS

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:14.567
AWAY FROM WRITING MEDICAL

EXEMPTIONS FOR CHILDREN WHO NEED

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:17.136
THEM.

01:56:17.203 --> 01:56:19.005
DOCTORS ARE AFRAID OF LOSING

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:19.505
THEIR PRACTICE AND THEIR

01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:21.374
LIVELIHOOD OVER A MEDICAL BOARD

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:23.042
INVESTIGATION.

01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:24.444
HERE IS WHY EVEN IF A DOCTOR

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.312
WINS THEIR CASE BEFORE THE

RIGHT.

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:33.019
THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN STILL PUT

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:34.487
THE DOCTOR ON PROBATION.

THERE ARE CONDITIONS WHERE

03:51:37.016 --> 03:51:39.285
FAMILY HISTORY ALONE -- WOULD

03:51:39.352 --> 03:51:40.987
WARRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

03:52:59.498 --> 03:53:00.633
SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

03:53:00.700 --> 03:53:01.667
SO WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT THE

03:53:01.734 --> 03:53:03.235
SAME SET OF FACTS WHILE TALKING

03:53:03.302 --> 03:53:04.537
ON THE SAME BILL.

03:53:04.603 --> 03:53:06.639
WHEN WE HAVE OUR DIALOGUE IN OUR

03:53:06.706 --> 03:53:10.509
OUR DISCUSSION TODAY -- ANOTHER

03:53:10.576 --> 03:53:12.545
THING AT MISTER CHAIR IT IS TO

03:53:12.611 --> 03:53:14.013

LINE OF QUESTIONING -- TURNING

03:53:21.721 --> 03:53:22.688
TO ANOTHER TOPIC YES.

03:53:22.755 --> 03:53:24.590
THE ISSUE OF DOCTORS PROVIDING

03:53:24.657 --> 03:53:25.624
FIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS A YEAR

03:53:25.691 --> 03:53:26.492
IS THAT A LIMIT OR A CAP ON HOW

03:53:26.559 --> 03:53:27.693
MANY MEDICAL EXEMPTION AS THEY

03:53:27.760 --> 03:53:29.195
CAN PROVIDE ORDERS THAT TRIGGER

03:53:29.261 --> 03:53:29.595
SOMETHING ELSE.

03:53:29.662 --> 03:53:31.063
NO IT IS NOT A LIMIT OR CATH I

03:53:31.130 --> 03:53:32.765
WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHAT THIS

03:53:32.832 --> 03:53:34.066
BILL DOES IT SAYS THAT IF YOU

03:53:34.133 --> 03:53:35.634
WRITE MORE THAN FIVE MEDICAL

03:53:35.701 --> 03:53:37.303
EXEMPTIONS -- THERE IS SOME

03:53:37.370 --> 03:53:38.604
ADDITIONAL SCREENINGS THAT'S

03:53:38.671 --> 03:53:39.638
FAIRLY UNUSUAL I'M A

03:53:39.705 --> 03:53:41.207
PEDIATRICIAN I PRACTICED AT UC

03:53:41.273 --> 03:53:43.275
DAVIS WHERE MY PRACTICE AS A

03:53:43.342 --> 03:53:44.677
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN INCLUDED

03:53:44.744 --> 03:53:46.145
MANY CHILDREN THE COMPLEX

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:48.180
CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE WERE TO

03:53:48.247 --> 03:53:50.082
SHERRY CARE CENTER RIGHT WHERE

03:53:50.149 --> 03:53:50.683
AN ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTER.

03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:51.817
AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK I'VE

03:53:51.884 --> 03:53:53.119
WRITTEN EVEN TEN MEDICAL

03:53:53.185 --> 03:53:56.722
EXEMPTIONS IN TWELVE YEARS WHEN

03:53:56.789 --> 03:53:57.323
I WAS THERE TO FAIRLY THE VERY

03:53:57.390 --> 03:53:57.923
RARE.

03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.724
BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT

03:53:58.791 --> 03:54:00.126
IF YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE

03:54:00.192 --> 03:54:01.927
IT'S AN COLLEGES MIGHT HAVE

03:54:01.994 --> 03:54:03.729
WRITTEN MANY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS.

03:54:03.796 --> 03:54:05.431
SO THEY WILL BE LOOKED AT AND

03:54:05.498 --> 03:54:06.265
THEY'LL POINT OUT THAT THE

03:54:06.332 --> 03:54:07.400
PATIENTS HAVE.

03:54:07.466 --> 03:54:08.567
CANCER TO MEET YOU FOR CANCER

03:54:08.634 --> 03:54:09.668
AND THOSE AT ALL BE LEGITIMATE

03:54:09.735 --> 03:54:12.438
THE ONLY THING THAT TRIGGERS THE

03:54:12.505 --> 03:54:13.839
PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU HAVE.

03:54:13.906 --> 03:54:14.874
FIVE SUSPECT EXEMPTIONS THAT

03:54:14.940 --> 03:54:17.143
THEN AFTER ONLY AFTER REVIEW

03:54:17.209 --> 03:54:18.944
WHERE IT'S BEEN VIEWED BY

03:54:19.011 --> 03:54:21.814
CLINICAL STAFF AT C. P. H. THEN

03:54:21.881 --> 03:54:23.916
PERHAPS REJECTED BY A PEER

03:54:23.983 --> 03:54:24.483
REVIEW PANEL.

03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:25.818
AND WE SAY WELL YOU KNOW THAT

03:54:25.885 --> 03:54:27.820
THAT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING AND

03:54:27.887 --> 03:54:28.721
PERHAPS -- THERE OUGHT TO BE

03:54:28.788 --> 03:54:30.689
GREATER SCRUTINY BY THE MEDICAL

03:54:30.756 --> 03:54:31.657
BOARD WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE TO

03:54:31.724 --> 03:54:33.025
DO AN INVESTIGATION SO THERE ARE

03:54:33.092 --> 03:54:35.294
SO MANY LAYERS BEFORE ANYTHING

03:54:35.361 --> 03:54:36.128
WOULD HAPPEN.

03:54:36.195 --> 03:54:38.364
SO I JUST POINT OUT THAT IF THEY

03:54:38.431 --> 03:54:40.433
IF YOU WROTE.

03:54:40.499 --> 03:54:42.501
DEL -- TEN TWENTY LEGITIMATE

03:54:42.568 --> 03:54:43.602
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IS ALSO

03:54:43.669 --> 03:54:44.737
LEGITIMATE YOU'RE FINE AND

03:54:44.804 --> 03:54:45.371
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

03:54:45.438 --> 03:54:46.705
TO KEEP IN MIND WE SIMPLY SAYING

03:54:46.772 --> 03:54:49.642
THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT

03:54:49.708 --> 03:54:49.842
THEM.

03:54:49.909 --> 03:54:50.943
BUT THERE FIND A FINE.

03:54:51.010 --> 03:54:52.545
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION

03:54:52.611 --> 03:54:55.614
SENATOR DR PAM I HAVE ONE MORE

03:54:55.681 --> 03:54:56.582
QUESTION IF IT'S OKAY OF THE

03:54:56.649 --> 03:54:58.117
CHECK -- YOU MENTION PEER REVIEW

03:54:58.184 --> 03:54:59.351
RIGHT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

03:54:59.418 --> 03:55:01.520
ROLE OF PEER REVIEW IN THE

03:55:01.587 --> 03:55:03.622
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE YES SO --

03:55:03.689 --> 03:55:05.758
TRADITIONALLY PEER REVIEW IS THE

03:55:05.825 --> 03:55:08.127
MECHANISM BY WHICH WE JUDGE

03:55:08.194 --> 03:55:10.396
WHETHER A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN

03:55:10.463 --> 03:55:11.730
IS.

03:55:11.797 --> 03:55:12.865
A IS ACTUALLY PRACTICING A

03:55:12.932 --> 03:55:14.500
WITHIN THEIR PROCREATE SPHERE OR

03:55:14.567 --> 03:55:16.235
THEY ARE PERHAPS DOING SOMETHING

03:55:16.302 --> 03:55:18.003
THAT MIGHT BE UNJUSTIFIED ON

03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:19.839
ETHICAL -- SO WE HAVE YOUR

03:55:19.905 --> 03:55:21.240
REVIEW BODIES AND HOSPITALS TO

03:55:21.307 --> 03:55:23.108
LOOK AT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND

03:55:23.175 --> 03:55:24.577
BEHAVIOR WE HAVE PEER REVIEW

WHEN THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ABOUT

03:55:28.047 --> 03:55:29.215
POSITIONS.

03:55:29.281 --> 03:55:30.382
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY

03:55:30.449 --> 03:55:31.584
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR

03:55:31.650 --> 03:55:34.286

03:55:36.822 --> 03:55:39.692
ACTUALLY IF THERE IS A CHALLENGE.

03:55:39.758 --> 03:55:40.493
TO THE WAY SOMEONE BILLS THERE

03:55:40.559 --> 03:55:43.329
IS A PURE PERSON WHO REVIEWS

03:55:43.395 --> 03:55:44.730
THAT DEPARTMENTS HEALTH CARE TO

03:55:44.797 --> 03:55:45.598
LOOK AT THE DAY BEHAVIOR

03:55:45.664 --> 03:55:46.866
PROGRAMS APPEAR IF YOU IS

03:55:46.932 --> 03:55:50.269
SOMETHING THAT IS COMMONLY USED

03:55:50.336 --> 03:55:51.537
IN THE KNOWLEDGE AND AND THE

03:55:51.604 --> 03:55:52.071

03:55:58.811 --> 03:55:59.778
MORE PRACTICE AND ARE THEY

03:55:59.845 --> 03:56:02.114
POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING OTHER

03:56:02.181 --> 03:56:04.049
PATIENTS ARE NOT PRACTICING UP

03:56:04.116 --> 03:56:05.718
TO QUALITY -- THEY MAY BE

03:56:05.784 --> 03:56:11.357
IMPAIRED WE USE PEER REVIEW IS A

03:56:11.423 --> 03:56:13.559
WAY TO MAKE THAT JUDGMENT.

03:56:13.626 --> 03:56:15.594
AND HAVE USED.

THANK YOU I I WANT TO START OFF

03:57:51.156 --> 03:57:52.992
BY SAYING THAT DESPITE WERE WE

03:57:53.058 --> 03:57:54.960
ALL MAY BE ON THIS ISSUE -- THAT

03:57:55.027 --> 03:57:58.831
DAY YOU KNOW A FIND ITS --

03:57:58.897 --> 03:57:59.865
REALLY BUT A HARD TO TO SEE HOW

03:57:59.932 --> 03:58:02.935
MANY PERSONAL ATTACKS YOU YOU

03:58:03.002 --> 03:58:03.569
TOOK -- ON THIS ISSUE.

03:58:03.636 --> 03:58:05.070
THIS IS A HARD ISSUE AND FOR

03:58:05.137 --> 03:58:07.272
MANY OF US THE DEBATE IS NOT.

03:58:07.339 --> 03:58:10.075
BASED ON A POLITICAL SIDE IT'S

03:58:10.142 --> 03:58:13.278
NOT BASED ON ANY ORGANIZATION IT

03:58:13.345 --> 03:58:15.848
IS NOT BASED ON A GOOD VERSUS

03:58:15.914 --> 03:58:16.482
BAD.

03:58:16.548 --> 03:58:21.320
IT IS HOW DO YOU HELP PARENTS

03:58:21.387 --> 03:58:22.988
WHO LOVE THEIR KIDS RIGHT.

03:58:23.055 --> 03:58:24.523

03:58:25.824 --> 03:58:27.893
ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM.

03:58:27.960 --> 03:58:30.062
AND SO I I JUST I I WANT TO SAY

03:58:30.129 --> 03:58:31.864
THAT BECAUSE AS I HEARD THE

03:58:31.930 --> 03:58:33.265
COMMENTS I THINK THAT'S LOST ON

03:58:33.332 --> 03:58:35.401
FOLKS I THINK IT'S EASY TO SAY

03:58:35.467 --> 03:58:37.202
THAT IT'S THIS GROUP OR THAT

03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:39.638

LIVED EXPERIENCE -- SO EIGHT

03:58:49.648 --> 03:58:50.883

04:04:12.304 --> 04:04:14.506
ASKED OF THE AUTHOR.

04:04:14.573 --> 04:04:15.374
I THANK YOU FOR THAT I

04:04:15.440 --> 04:04:16.408
APPRECIATE IT -- I WOULD LIKE TO

04:04:16.475 --> 04:04:17.542
JUST ADDRESS FAMILY HEALTH

04:04:17.609 --> 04:04:18.343
HISTORY -- BRIEFLY BECAUSE I

04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:19.478
THINK IT IS A PIVOTAL POINT FOR

04:04:19.544 --> 04:04:22.447
A LOT OF YOUR INTERNAL ANALYSES

04:04:22.514 --> 04:04:24.883
ON WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE

04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:25.484
A CERTAIN WAY ON THIS BILL OR

04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:26.418
NOT.

04:04:26.485 --> 04:04:28.553
THE RELEVANT LANGUAGE OF TWO

04:04:28.620 --> 04:04:29.788
SEVENTY SIX AS AMENDED STATES

04:04:29.855 --> 04:04:31.323
THE DEPARTMENT MAY ACCEPT A

04:04:31.390 --> 04:04:33.825
MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- THAT IS

04:04:33.892 --> 04:04:35.961
BASED ON FAMILY HISTORY -- AS

04:04:36.028 --> 04:04:37.062
LONG AS THE DOCTOR PROVIDES

04:04:37.129 --> 04:04:39.031
WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION TO SUPPORT

04:04:39.097 --> 04:04:40.932
THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

04:04:40.999 --> 04:04:42.834
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

04:04:42.901 --> 04:04:46.204
RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE.

04:04:46.271 --> 04:04:48.240
IF WE WERE TRULY LEAVING THIS AT

04:04:48.306 --> 04:04:49.908
FAMILY HEALTH HISTORY.

04:04:49.975 --> 04:04:51.676
THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR THAT

04:04:51.743 --> 04:04:53.211
LETTER CLAUSE.

04:04:53.278 --> 04:04:55.847
WE LIKE YOU WANTED TO BE VERY

04:04:55.914 --> 04:04:58.183
CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL MEANT AND

04:04:58.250 --> 04:05:00.852
WE LIKE YOUWANT TO SENATOR PANS

04:05:00.919 --> 04:05:02.487
OFFICE YESTERDAY.

04:05:02.554 --> 04:05:05.090
AND WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED IS

04:05:05.157 --> 04:05:07.159
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY GOING TO

04:05:07.225 --> 04:05:09.795
BE ALLOWED UNDER SB TWO SEVENTY

04:05:09.861 --> 04:05:10.362
SIX BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL

04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:13.031
RECOGNIZE THE NEW AMENDMENTS

04:05:13.098 --> 04:05:14.633
WERE -- THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM

04:05:14.699 --> 04:05:16.735
AND THEY WERE KIND OF FUN AND

04:05:16.802 --> 04:05:18.170
INTERESTING TO READ THROUGH.

04:05:18.236 --> 04:05:19.738
AND REPEATEDLY WHAT WAS TOLD

04:05:19.805 --> 04:05:21.673
BACK TO US IS IT WILL BE

04:05:21.740 --> 04:05:25.510
RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE.

04:05:25.577 --> 04:05:26.745
RELEVANT STANDARD OF CARE

04:05:26.812 --> 04:05:30.115
DEFAULTS TO CDC GUIDELINES AND A

04:05:30.182 --> 04:05:31.917
SEVEN AND A. P. WHICH IF YOU

04:05:31.983 --> 04:05:33.718
HAVE READ THEM OR MIRROR IMAGES

04:05:33.785 --> 04:05:35.153
OF EACH OTHER SO THE ADDITIONAL

04:05:35.220 --> 04:05:36.555
LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THAT

04:05:36.621 --> 04:05:37.456
BILL.

04:05:37.522 --> 04:05:38.690
BASICALLY DOESN'T GET US

04:05:38.757 --> 04:05:39.524
ANYWHERE OTHER THAN CDC

04:05:39.591 --> 04:05:42.427
GUIDELINES AND CDC GUIDELINES DO

04:05:42.494 --> 04:05:43.095
NOT.

04:05:43.161 --> 04:05:44.596
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FAMILY HEALTH

04:05:44.663 --> 04:05:47.299
HISTORY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF

04:05:47.365 --> 04:05:48.633
VACCINES THAT THEY COVER.

04:05:48.700 --> 04:05:52.037
WHICH IS TO SAY IF WE VOTE THIS

04:05:52.104 --> 04:05:53.238
INTO A FACT.

04:05:53.305 --> 04:05:56.141
A CHILD WHO IS A SIBLING.

04:05:56.208 --> 04:05:58.710
OF A CHILD WHO DIED FROM A

04:05:58.777 --> 04:06:01.213
CERTIFIABLY PROVABLY DONE

04:06:01.279 --> 04:06:03.315
VACCINE REACTION BY THE VACCINE

04:06:03.381 --> 04:06:06.651
COURTS WOULD NO LONGER QUALIFY

04:06:06.718 --> 04:06:08.353
FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION I WOULD

04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:11.323
LIKE TO SPEAK. TO MY SUBJECT

04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:12.891
MATTER EXPERTISE.

04:06:12.958 --> 04:06:14.259
I SKIPPED HIGH SCHOOL I STARTED

04:06:14.326 --> 04:06:15.927
COLLEGE AT FOURTEEN I WAS

04:06:15.994 --> 04:06:17.496

PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER OSS ON

04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:20.499
THE COUNTRY AT AGE SEVENTEEN AND

04:06:20.565 --> 04:06:20.899
A HALF.

04:06:20.966 --> 04:06:22.868
I REPRESENTED LARGE FORTUNE FIVE

04:06:22.934 --> 04:06:23.768
HUNDRED COMPANIES ASK THE

04:06:23.835 --> 04:06:25.637
QUESTION I I JUST I I WOULD LIKE

04:06:25.704 --> 04:06:26.705
TO STICK TO THAT QUESTION SO I

04:06:26.771 --> 04:06:28.974
APPRECIATE YOUR AND I

04:06:29.040 --> 04:06:31.176

ANSWER AND I WOULD PLEASE.

04:06:32.377 --> 04:06:35.180
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR

04:06:35.247 --> 04:06:36.781
YES -- IF.

04:06:36.848 --> 04:06:38.049
THE COMMENT MADE ABOUT THE

04:06:38.116 --> 04:06:40.418
LATTER PART OF I KNOW I DIDN'T

04:06:40.485 --> 04:06:42.287
HEAR THAT IT WAS AMENDMENTS AND

04:06:42.354 --> 04:06:43.955
AMENDMENTS BUT I HEARD THAT IT

04:06:44.022 --> 04:06:45.023
WAS A CONCERN IF YOU COULD JUST

04:06:45.090 --> 04:06:45.490
REPLY.

04:06:45.557 --> 04:06:47.959
SO SO WE APPLY STANDARD OF CARE

04:06:48.026 --> 04:06:49.427
RIGHT SO OTHERWISE IF YOU DON'T

04:06:49.494 --> 04:06:51.129
HAVE STANDARD OF CARE THEN

04:06:51.196 --> 04:06:52.964
YOU'RE SAYING THAT SO WHAT I

04:06:53.031 --> 04:06:53.298
KNOW WE ALL.

04:06:53.365 --> 04:06:54.733
WE ARE FAMILIES AND WE ALL HAVE

04:06:54.799 --> 04:06:56.334
FAMILY HISTORIES RIGHT.

04:06:56.401 --> 04:06:58.303
SO YOU HAVE A UNCLE WHO MIGHT

04:06:58.370 --> 04:06:59.704
HAVE HAD A HEART ATTACK YOU HAD

04:06:59.771 --> 04:07:01.673
ON TO DEVELOP CANCER YOU HAD A

04:07:01.740 --> 04:07:02.841
COUSIN WHO.

04:07:02.908 --> 04:07:08.613
SO.

04:07:08.680 --> 04:07:10.382
WE ALL HAVE FAMILY HISTORIES.

04:07:10.448 --> 04:07:11.683
AND EVEN PEOPLE ARE ADOPTED HAVE

04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:12.317
ONES THEY MAY NOT KNOW BE AWARE

04:07:12.384 --> 04:07:12.984
OF WE ALL HAVE FAMILY HISTORY SO

04:07:13.051 --> 04:07:14.052
IF YOU DON'T SAY STANDARD OF

04:07:14.119 --> 04:07:14.486
CARE.

04:07:14.553 --> 04:07:15.253
THAN JUST HAVING A FAMILY

04:07:15.320 --> 04:07:16.221
HISTORY THEN BECOMES A REASON

04:07:16.288 --> 04:07:17.088
FOR AN EXEMPTION.

04:07:17.155 --> 04:07:18.924
I MEAN WE APPLY STANDARD OF CARE

04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:20.825
FOR EVERYTHING SO IF YOU.

04:07:20.892 --> 04:07:22.160
SAY YOU HAVE A SYMPTOM OF

04:07:22.227 --> 04:07:23.828
SOMETING AND SO THE PHYSICIAN

04:07:23.895 --> 04:07:24.729
FOR EXAMPLE SAYS WELL YOU KNOW

04:07:24.796 --> 04:07:26.798
WHAT YOU SAID YOU HAVE A LITTLE

04:07:26.865 --> 04:07:28.433
YOU KNOW ACHE IN YOUR TOOTH.

04:07:28.500 --> 04:07:29.901
I'LL GIVE YOU A LARGE DOSE OF

04:07:29.968 --> 04:07:31.303
OPIOIDS AND THEN YOU SAY WELL

04:07:31.369 --> 04:07:33.338
YOU KNOW WHAT PAIN YOU KNOW IS

04:07:33.405 --> 04:07:34.673
IS A REASON FOR THAT.

04:07:34.739 --> 04:07:36.041
AND I THINK WE WOULD SAY WELL

04:07:36.107 --> 04:07:37.075
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:07:37.142 --> 04:07:39.211
THAT LEVEL PAYING ME NOT NESTLE

04:07:39.277 --> 04:07:41.279
WARRANTED AND SO WHAT IS THE

04:07:41.346 --> 04:07:43.081
STANDARD OF CARE THAT SOME

04:07:43.148 --> 04:07:43.615
PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY SAY

04:07:43.682 --> 04:07:44.216
STANDARD OF CARE IS A LITTLE

04:07:44.282 --> 04:07:45.617
BROAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S

04:07:45.684 --> 04:07:47.185
ESTABLISHED BY PHYSICIANS FOR

04:07:47.252 --> 04:07:47.819
EACH OTHER.

04:07:47.886 --> 04:07:49.521
AND LIKE WELL OKAY DOCTORS ARE

04:07:49.588 --> 04:07:50.655
TEND TO BE A LITTLE MORE

04:07:50.722 --> 04:07:52.057
FORGIVING OF EACH OTHER AND SAY

04:07:52.123 --> 04:07:52.924
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT.

04:07:52.991 --> 04:07:54.392
WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE LATITUDE

04:07:54.459 --> 04:07:56.761
BECAUSE GOT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD

04:07:56.828 --> 04:07:58.296
I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS AT BECAUSE

04:07:58.363 --> 04:07:59.564
CLINICAL SITUATION SO.

04:07:59.631 --> 04:08:01.066
SO I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT

04:08:01.132 --> 04:08:03.268
BY ELIMINATING STANDARD OF CARE

04:08:03.335 --> 04:08:04.236
DOESN'T WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED

04:08:04.302 --> 04:08:04.603
TO MEAN THAT.

04:08:04.669 --> 04:08:05.637
IF YOU SIMPLY HAVE A FAMILY

04:08:05.704 --> 04:08:07.339
HISTORY YOU CAN EXEMPTION HI I

04:08:07.405 --> 04:08:08.840
THINK MOST OF US WOULD SAY THAT

04:08:08.907 --> 04:08:11.443
WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE -- TO TO

04:08:11.509 --> 04:08:13.511
DO THAT -- SO I WOULD ALSO POINT

04:08:13.578 --> 04:08:15.447
OUT THAT BY THE WAY -- WELL

04:08:15.513 --> 04:08:17.816
CERTAINLY THE OPPONENTS -- HAVE

04:08:17.882 --> 04:08:20.619
COMPLAINED THAT THE ACIP IN A P.

04:08:20.685 --> 04:08:21.920
VERY EACH OTHER I WOULD SAY THAT

04:08:21.987 --> 04:08:23.188
THERE YOU ARE STAFF LIST

04:08:23.255 --> 04:08:24.522
INDEPENDENTLY.

04:08:24.589 --> 04:08:26.691
DAVE HE EVALUATES THE DATA ON

04:08:26.758 --> 04:08:28.026
THEIR OWN ACHT EVALUATES THE

04:08:28.093 --> 04:08:29.327
DATA IF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

04:08:29.394 --> 04:08:31.062
SIMILAR PRIDE JUST SPEAKS TO THE

04:08:31.129 --> 04:08:38.103
FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE BUT HE'S

04:08:38.169 --> 04:08:39.337
POINTS TO THE SAME DIRECTION.

04:08:39.404 --> 04:08:40.872
AND ALSO IN THIS BILL WE

04:08:40.939 --> 04:08:42.007
ACTUALLY DON'T SAY IT'S JUST A

04:08:42.073 --> 04:08:43.708
C. I. T. AND A. P..

04:08:43.775 --> 04:08:44.876
IT IS STANDARD CARE BY THE WAY

04:08:44.943 --> 04:08:46.177
THE REVIEW PANEL THE APPEALS

04:08:46.244 --> 04:08:47.979
PANEL FAXING PHYSICIANS IT'S

04:08:48.046 --> 04:08:48.847
PURELY STAND OF CARE BASICALLY --

04:08:48.913 --> 04:08:50.081
IF THERE'S IF IT'S REASONABLE

04:08:50.148 --> 04:08:51.016
THE THINK THAT SOMETHING WITHIN

04:08:51.082 --> 04:08:51.750
REASON OF PER OF PHYSICIAN

04:08:51.816 --> 04:08:53.118
PRACTICING CALIFORNIA IS

04:08:53.184 --> 04:08:54.653
PRACTICING GOOD MEDICINE.

04:08:54.719 --> 04:08:58.556
ARE THESE RETAIL DECENT MEDICINE.

04:08:58.623 --> 04:09:00.091
THINKS IT'S OKAY THAT WOULD SET

04:09:00.158 --> 04:09:01.426
THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE SO IT

04:09:01.493 --> 04:09:02.527
THAT THAT'S ROUTE IT'S I THINK

04:09:02.594 --> 04:09:03.962
IT'S A VERY -- LIBERAL STANDARD

04:09:04.029 --> 04:09:05.530
ACTUALLY AND IS THAT STANDARD A

04:09:05.597 --> 04:09:08.400
STANDARD THAT IS APPLIED OR USE

04:09:08.466 --> 04:09:09.701
IN THIS CONTEXT OR OTHER

04:09:09.768 --> 04:09:11.703
CONTENTS EQUIVALENT TO THIS BY

04:09:11.770 --> 04:09:12.937
THE MEDICAL BOARD BY OUR STATE

04:09:13.004 --> 04:09:14.205
MEDICAL BOARD YES THE MEDICAL

04:09:14.272 --> 04:09:15.040
BOARD ITSELF RIGHT WHEN THEY

04:09:15.106 --> 04:09:17.108
EVALUATE DID A PHYSICIAN VIA YOU

04:09:17.175 --> 04:09:18.843
KNOW AT SHOULD BE PENALIZED.

THEY CONSULT -- PHYSICIANS AND

04:09:22.347 --> 04:09:23.381
THEY YOU KNOW THEY BRING IN A

04:09:23.448 --> 04:09:23.982
POSITION BECAUSE ALL THEY SAY

04:09:24.049 --> 04:09:25.216
WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

04:09:25.283 --> 04:09:26.818
NORMALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

04:09:26.885 --> 04:09:28.219
NORMAL PRACTICE OF THE POSITION

04:09:28.286 --> 04:09:29.788
IN THAT FIELD.

04:09:29.854 --> 04:09:30.955
AND THAT'S THAT'S ALL THE MAKE

04:09:31.022 --> 04:09:31.623
THAT JUDGMENT WHETHER THEY WOULD

04:09:31.690 --> 04:09:36.594
PURSUE AFTER INVESTIGATION WILL

04:09:36.661 --> 04:09:38.063

DISCRETION OF THE I NEVER WANT

04:09:48.740 --> 04:09:49.240
TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE IN THE

04:09:49.307 --> 04:09:51.343
OPPOSITION IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY

AS I STATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE

04:22:30.601 --> 04:22:31.402
WE ARE HAVING.

04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.969
ISSUES ITH LOOKING AT THESE

04:22:32.036 --> 04:22:33.337
MEDICAL EXEMPTION CASES BECAUSE

04:22:33.404 --> 04:22:34.638
I THINK A CENTER PAN MENTION

04:22:34.705 --> 04:22:35.406
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

04:22:35.473 --> 04:22:37.575
AUTHORIZATION FROM THE PARENT IN

04:22:37.641 --> 04:22:39.110
ORDER TO GET THE RELEASE FOR THE

04:22:39.176 --> 04:22:40.177
MEDICAL RECORDS.

04:22:40.244 --> 04:22:41.345
IN A CENTER PAN SAID THAT'S THE

04:22:41.412 --> 04:22:42.513
FIRST STEP IN OUR FOR SOME

04:22:42.580 --> 04:22:43.280
PROCESS.

04:22:43.347 --> 04:22:45.015
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE ANOTHER

04:22:45.082 --> 04:22:47.051
POSITION EXPERT LOOK AT THE

04:22:47.118 --> 04:22:49.153
MEDICAL RECORDS THE AND WHICH

04:22:49.220 --> 04:22:51.255
INCLUDES THE HISTORY AND AND

04:22:51.322 --> 04:22:52.590
THEY BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISION

04:22:52.656 --> 04:22:54.091
ON WHICH TO THAT CASE GO FOR FOR

04:22:54.158 --> 04:22:54.959
AN INVESTIGATION.

04:22:55.025 --> 04:22:55.993
IF WE CAN'T GET THOSE MEDICAL

04:22:56.060 --> 04:22:58.028
RECORDS WE DO HAVE ISSUES AND

04:22:58.095 --> 04:22:59.463
LOOKING AT THESE CASES HOW MANY

04:22:59.530 --> 04:23:01.232
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE YOU BEEN

04:23:01.298 --> 04:23:03.067
ABLE TO COMPLETE.

04:23:03.134 --> 04:23:07.538
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME STATISTICS

04:23:07.605 --> 04:23:09.240
WHERE DOES PULL NOT REALLY FAST.

04:23:09.306 --> 04:23:10.141
AND IF YOU CAN WHILE YOU'RE

04:23:10.207 --> 04:23:10.774
LOOKING AT THOSE STATISTICS HOW

04:23:10.841 --> 04:23:12.309
MANY HAVE YOU BEEN UNABLE TO

04:23:12.376 --> 04:23:14.178
COMPLETE SO I DON'T HAVE THAT

04:23:14.245 --> 04:23:14.778
INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT

04:23:14.845 --> 04:23:16.814
CATEGORIES THAT WAY BUT I CAN

04:23:16.881 --> 04:23:17.615
GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION I HAVE

04:23:17.681 --> 04:23:20.951
SO -- WE HAVE RECEIVED A HUNDRED

04:23:21.018 --> 04:23:22.620
AND SEVENTY NINE COMPLAINTS --

04:23:22.686 --> 04:23:24.088
WE'VE TAKEN ONE ACTION THAT

04:23:24.155 --> 04:23:26.357
RESULTED IN PROBATION WE HAVE A

04:23:26.423 --> 04:23:28.025
HUNDRED AND THREE INVESTIGATIONS

04:23:28.092 --> 04:23:30.661
CURRENTLY PENDING -- AND THE

04:23:30.728 --> 04:23:31.862
NUMBEROF COMPLAINTS CLOSED AS

04:23:31.929 --> 04:23:34.165
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS FORTY

04:23:34.231 --> 04:23:35.633
NINE AND SO THAT COULD BE FOR A

04:23:35.699 --> 04:23:36.534
VARIETY OF THINGS BECAUSE WE

04:23:36.600 --> 04:23:38.102
DON'T HAVE A CATEGORIES THAT WE

04:23:38.169 --> 04:23:39.436
IN OUR SYSTEM SO COULD BE.

04:23:39.503 --> 04:23:40.938
THAT WE DIDN'T GET THE MEDICAL

04:23:41.005 --> 04:23:41.605
RECORDS WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE

04:23:41.672 --> 04:23:43.340
CASES IT COULD BE THAT WE ARE

04:23:43.407 --> 04:23:44.175
ABLE TO LOOK AT HIM AND OUR

04:23:44.241 --> 04:23:45.142
EXPERTS SAID THERE WAS

04:23:45.209 --> 04:23:47.011
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.

04:23:47.077 --> 04:23:48.379
BUT THAT NUMBER IS FORTY NINE

04:23:48.445 --> 04:23:50.648
HOW LONG ON AVERAGE DOES ONE OF

04:23:50.714 --> 04:23:51.882

I'M OUR INVESTIGATIONS ON

04:23:53.617 --> 04:23:55.853
AVERAGE AND THESE INVESTIGATIONS

04:23:55.920 --> 04:23:57.388
ARE LIKE THE OTHER INVESTIGATION

04:23:57.454 --> 04:23:59.190
SO THEY CAN TAKE -- A YEAR A

04:23:59.256 --> 04:24:00.691
YEAR AND A HALF TO INVESTIGATE

04:24:00.758 --> 04:24:01.625
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THE

04:24:01.692 --> 04:24:03.327
MEDICAL RECORDS WE HAVE TO

04:24:03.394 --> 04:24:04.361
DECIDE OF THAT NEEDS AN

04:24:04.428 --> 04:24:05.429
INVESTIGATION THEN IT GOES TO

04:24:05.496 --> 04:24:08.866

THAT WE SUPPORT IN THIS BILL

04:24:22.146 --> 04:24:23.681

TO THIS IDEA OF A ONE DOCTOR

04:25:45.996 --> 04:25:47.598
ONLY BE ABLE TO HAVE FIVE

04:25:47.665 --> 04:25:49.233
EXEMPTIONS.

04:25:49.300 --> 04:25:51.535
I HAD SPOKEN EARLIER TODAY WITH

04:25:51.602 --> 04:25:53.804
A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE --

04:25:53.871 --> 04:25:57.274
AND THEY HAD -- A LITTLE A

04:25:57.341 --> 04:25:59.777
LITTLE BABY GIRL -- THAT WENT

04:25:59.843 --> 04:26:02.413

04:26:02.479 --> 04:26:05.316
AND OF AND VERY NEXT DAY --

04:26:05.382 --> 04:26:07.117
THERE IS A RASH THAT DEVELOPED --

04:26:07.184 --> 04:26:10.120
AND THAT RASH STATE -- FOR A

04:26:10.187 --> 04:26:11.555
LITTLE OVER OVER A YEAR.

04:26:11.622 --> 04:26:14.992
AND SO THEY SOUGHT OUT -- BUT

04:26:15.059 --> 04:26:15.793
THEY WERE ALL THIS AND VERY

04:26:15.859 --> 04:26:17.695
SCARED -- DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO

04:26:17.761 --> 04:26:19.496
THINK GOT ONLINE STARTED DIGGING

04:26:19.563 --> 04:26:21.265
UP A BUNCH OF INFORMATION AND

04:26:21.332 --> 04:26:22.633
THEN ONE OUT AND SOUGHT OUT A

04:26:22.700 --> 04:26:26.136
DOCTOR -- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE --

04:26:26.203 --> 04:26:28.872
THEM -- SOME SOME GUIDANCE AND

04:26:28.939 --> 04:26:30.941
SO IF YOU'RE SEEKING EIGHT A

04:26:31.008 --> 04:26:33.544
DOCTOR WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME

04:26:33.610 --> 04:26:35.012
ON THESE ISSUES AND I HAVE TO

04:26:35.079 --> 04:26:36.313
BELIEVE THAT THERE.

04:26:36.380 --> 04:26:38.115
ARE SOME BAD DOCTORS BUT THERE'S

04:26:38.182 --> 04:26:40.117
ALSO SOME GOOD DOCTORS AS WELL

04:26:40.184 --> 04:26:41.752
WHO SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME.

04:26:41.819 --> 04:26:44.321
ON THIS ISSUE AND IF THAT ONE

04:26:44.388 --> 04:26:45.689
GOOD DOCTOR WHO'S BECOME AN

04:26:45.756 --> 04:26:48.492
EXPERT IN THESE ISSUES WHY WOULD

04:26:48.559 --> 04:26:49.693
BE UNACCEPTABLE.

04:26:49.760 --> 04:26:52.463
OF FOR THEM TO WRITE MORE THAN

04:26:52.529 --> 04:26:53.097
FIVE OR FOR THAT MATTER ON THE

04:26:53.163 --> 04:26:57.368
BE AT RISK OF FOR TEN TWENTY

04:26:57.434 --> 04:26:58.902
THIRTY FORTY HUNDREDS OF THESE

04:26:58.969 --> 04:27:01.271
BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN EVEN

04:27:01.338 --> 04:27:02.373
EXPERT THERE'S GOING TO BE THE

04:27:02.439 --> 04:27:02.973
PEOPLE GOING TO SEE SEEK THEM

04:27:03.040 --> 04:27:03.707
OUT WHY WOULD THAT BE

04:27:03.774 --> 04:27:04.041
UNACCEPTABLE.

04:27:04.108 --> 04:27:05.275
WHAT FIRST OF ALL I POINT OUT

04:27:05.342 --> 04:27:12.449
THAT THE FIVE IS NOT A CAP?

04:27:12.516 --> 04:27:13.517
IT'S A TRIGGER FOR EXAMINATION

04:27:13.584 --> 04:27:15.753
RIGHT SO IT'S NOT A CAP -- IT SO

04:27:15.819 --> 04:27:17.421
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF YOU SO

04:27:17.488 --> 04:27:19.056
IF YOU ARE AN AS AT POINT OUT

04:27:19.123 --> 04:27:20.824
EXAMPLE MIGHT BE AN ECOLOGIST OR

04:27:20.891 --> 04:27:22.693
YOUR SONY TAKES A LOT TRANSPLANT

04:27:22.760 --> 04:27:23.761
PATIENTS RIGHT.

04:27:23.827 --> 04:27:25.062
YOUR TO FROLIC JUST AND YOU HAVE

04:27:25.129 --> 04:27:26.730
A LOT OF KIDS OF KIDNEY

04:27:26.797 --> 04:27:28.098
TRANSPLANTS CORRECT AND AND

04:27:28.165 --> 04:27:29.166
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY SPEND A LOT

04:27:29.233 --> 04:27:30.501
OF TIME WITH YOU IT'S JUST

04:27:30.567 --> 04:27:32.369
EASIER TO ASK YOU ARE YOU YOU

04:27:32.436 --> 04:27:33.737
MIGHT WANT TO BE THE ONE TO

04:27:33.804 --> 04:27:34.938
RAISE THE ISSUE OF I THINK YOU

04:27:35.005 --> 04:27:35.439
NEED. TO HAVE A MEDICAL

04:27:35.506 --> 04:27:37.141
EXEMPTION FACT I WOULD POINT OUT

04:27:37.207 --> 04:27:38.976
THAT MOST OF THE TIME.

04:27:39.042 --> 04:27:39.543
YOU SHOULD IT'S USUALLY THE

04:27:39.610 --> 04:27:41.345
DOCTOR WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THE

04:27:41.412 --> 04:27:43.514
PATIENT IS AS YOU WELL YOU HAVE

04:27:43.580 --> 04:27:44.114
A CONDITION I DON'T THINK YOU

04:27:44.181 --> 04:27:45.716
CHARGING GET THE VACCINE THAT

04:27:45.783 --> 04:27:46.817
WHICH MEANS THEN I SHOULD GIVE

04:27:46.884 --> 04:27:47.684
YOU MEDICAL SENSE AND NOT THE

04:27:47.751 --> 04:27:49.052
PARENT GOING -- I WANT A MEDICAL

04:27:49.119 --> 04:27:50.821
EXEMPTION IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER

04:27:50.888 --> 04:27:52.923
WAY AROUND ACTUALLY WHERE OF

04:27:52.990 --> 04:27:53.657
PHYSICIANS TAKING CARE OF A

04:27:53.724 --> 04:27:55.025
CHILD TO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I

04:27:55.092 --> 04:27:56.527
CONCERNED WHETHER A VACCINE

04:27:56.593 --> 04:27:57.327
WOULD BE.

04:27:57.394 --> 04:27:58.462
YOU KNOW THE BEST THING FOR YOUR

04:27:58.529 --> 04:28:00.130
CHILD THEREFORE I I WOULD

04:28:00.197 --> 04:28:01.532
RECOMMEND YOU NOT GET THE

04:28:01.598 --> 04:28:02.900
VACCINES AND I'M GOING TO GO

RIGHT YEAH SUBMIT A MEDICAL

04:28:03.534 --> 04:28:04.468
EXEMPTION.

04:28:04.535 --> 04:28:06.069
AND SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS

04:28:06.136 --> 04:28:08.372
THAT -- IS IT ANY PHYSICIAN HIS

04:28:08.439 --> 04:28:10.374
WRITING APPROPRIATE LEGITIMATE

04:28:10.441 --> 04:28:15.679
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HAS NOTHING

04:28:15.746 --> 04:28:17.014
TO FEAR.

04:28:17.080 --> 04:28:18.415
BECAUSE THAT FIVE TO SIMPLY FOR

04:28:18.482 --> 04:28:19.383
EXAMINATION WE WANTED TO BE MORE

04:28:19.450 --> 04:28:21.218
TARGETED THAT'S WHY WE PICKED

04:28:21.285 --> 04:28:22.319
THE FIVE BUT THE BASICALLY IF

04:28:22.386 --> 04:28:23.387
THE THIS IS A LEGITIMATE YOU'VE

04:28:23.454 --> 04:28:25.422
JUSTIFY THE REASON -- THEN --

04:28:25.489 --> 04:28:27.524
WE'VE APPROVED AND WAS APPROVED

04:28:27.591 --> 04:28:29.726
THERE'S NO NO ISSUE IT'S THAT IF

04:28:29.793 --> 04:28:31.795
YOU'RE SUBMITTING NUMEROUS

04:28:31.862 --> 04:28:32.763
EXEMPTIONS.

04:28:32.830 --> 04:28:35.332
THAT ARE SUSPECT AND THEY GO

04:28:35.399 --> 04:28:37.000
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND BOTH ALL

04:28:37.067 --> 04:28:38.168
THE REVIEW SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT

04:28:38.235 --> 04:28:39.303
WE'RE REJECTING THIS ONE

04:28:39.369 --> 04:28:41.738
REJECTING ANOTHER ONE REJECTING

04:28:41.805 --> 04:28:42.773
ANOTHER.

04:28:42.840 --> 04:28:44.374
ONE THEN THAT LEADS TO GREATER

04:28:44.441 --> 04:28:45.843
THAN THAT LEADS TO AN ISSUE SO

04:28:45.909 --> 04:28:47.010
ITS ROUTE SO THIS IS THE

04:28:47.077 --> 04:28:49.046
OVERSIGHT PART RIGHT SO WHAT

04:28:49.112 --> 04:28:53.717
HAPPENS IS THAT IT WE WANT -- TO

04:28:53.784 --> 04:28:55.118
BE SURE THAT WERE -- BE SHOULD

04:28:55.185 --> 04:28:56.053
BE SURE THAT THE PERSON

04:28:56.119 --> 04:28:57.888
EXERCISING RESPONSIBILITY BY THE

04:28:57.955 --> 04:28:59.923
EVIDENCE SHOWS THE PROOF SHOWS A

04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.924
SUBMIT THEM OF THEIR EXAMINED

04:29:00.991 --> 04:29:02.593
AND THOSE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE

04:29:02.659 --> 04:29:04.027
THEY CAN WRITE AS MANY AS THEY

04:29:04.094 --> 04:29:05.128
WATCHED.

04:29:05.195 --> 04:29:07.531
THERE'S NO CAP IT SIMPLY SAYS IF

04:29:07.598 --> 04:29:08.932
YOU WRITE MORE AND FIVE IN THE

04:29:08.999 --> 04:29:11.902
YEAR YOUR SUBJECT -- TO SOME

04:29:11.969 --> 04:29:13.303
ADDITIONAL SKILLED YEAH I WAS

04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:14.972
WITH YOUR SAID THAT THAT THE

04:29:15.038 --> 04:29:16.273
EXEMPTION ITSELF ACTUALLY IS IT.

04:29:16.340 --> 04:29:18.175
SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY YOU'RE NOT

04:29:18.242 --> 04:29:19.209
LESS YOU'VE BEEN WRITING A LOT

04:29:19.276 --> 04:29:20.844
OF THE ONES THAT BEEN REJECTED.

04:29:20.911 --> 04:29:23.247
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT --

04:29:23.313 --> 04:29:25.282
THE EVEN A COLLEGE JUST -- WHO

04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:27.751
MAY END UP WRITING MORE FIVE IN

04:29:27.818 --> 04:29:28.785
A YEAR DESPITE NOT GONNA WRITE

04:29:28.852 --> 04:29:30.087
HUNDREDS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

04:29:30.153 --> 04:29:31.522
REALLY TAKING CARE THAT MANY

04:29:31.588 --> 04:29:32.756
PATIENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM

04:29:32.823 --> 04:29:34.258
BUT THAT AGAIN DEPENDS ON THE

04:29:34.324 --> 04:29:34.791
CIRCUMSTANCE?

04:29:34.858 --> 04:29:36.026
THANK YOU KNOW IF -- MISTER

04:29:36.093 --> 04:29:37.027
ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO ASK

04:29:37.094 --> 04:29:38.128
DOCTOR SEARS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

04:29:38.195 --> 04:29:39.663
I THINK DOCTOR SEARS MIGHT BE

04:29:39.730 --> 04:29:41.932
ONE OF THOSE -- DOCTORS THAT

04:29:41.999 --> 04:29:45.736
PEOPLE UP C. SEEK OUT -- AND US

04:29:45.802 --> 04:29:47.070
SO WELL.

04:29:47.137 --> 04:29:49.039
YOU KNOW BUT WE CAN SPEAK TO

04:29:49.106 --> 04:29:49.239
THAT.

04:29:49.306 --> 04:29:52.342
YES I'M MY MY CONCERN IS CALLED

04:29:52.409 --> 04:29:53.443
TELL YOU GUYS WHAT I'VE BEEN

04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:56.079
DOING UNDER SP TWO SEVEN SEVEN

04:29:56.146 --> 04:29:56.980
FOR THREE FOUR YEARS NOW.

04:29:57.047 --> 04:29:59.049
WHEN I SEE A CHILD WITH A SEVERE

04:29:59.116 --> 04:30:00.884
VACCINE REACTION?

04:30:00.951 --> 04:30:03.220
THAT'S NOT A CUT CDC GUIDELINES

04:30:03.287 --> 04:30:04.621
BUT IT'S SOMETHING NOT ME --

04:30:04.688 --> 04:30:05.722
IMMEDIATELY LIFE THREATENING

04:30:05.789 --> 04:30:07.624
SUCH AS A SEIZURE OR IN YOUR

04:30:07.691 --> 04:30:08.926
EXAMPLE THE CHILD WHO DEVELOPED

04:30:08.992 --> 04:30:11.428
CHRONIC EXAM A RASH AFTER MMR

04:30:11.495 --> 04:30:12.696
VACCINE FOR SOMEONE AT A

04:30:12.763 --> 04:30:14.531
TEMPORARY NERVE INJURY AFTER

04:30:14.598 --> 04:30:15.666
VACCINATION.

04:30:15.732 --> 04:30:18.869
NONE OF THOSE ARE CDC GUIDELINES

04:30:18.936 --> 04:30:20.938
TO TO STOP ACTIVATION BUT UNDER

04:30:21.004 --> 04:30:22.806
SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHEN I WAS UP

04:30:22.873 --> 04:30:24.508
TO MY JUDGMENT AS A DOCTOR I CAN

04:30:24.575 --> 04:30:25.375
JUDGE.

04:30:25.442 --> 04:30:27.110
THAT CHILD SHOULDN'T GET MORE

04:30:27.177 --> 04:30:29.379
DOSES OF THAT VACCINE SO THAT I

04:30:29.446 --> 04:30:30.948
CAN DECIDE THAT THAT CHILD TO BE

04:30:31.014 --> 04:30:32.516
EXACT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S FAIR

04:30:32.583 --> 04:30:33.483
AND I WOULD.

04:30:33.550 --> 04:30:34.685
I WOULD IMAGINE A LOT OF YOU

04:30:34.751 --> 04:30:35.619
WOULD NOT WANT TO GIVE YOUR

04:30:35.686 --> 04:30:37.921
CHILD MORE DOSES OF THE VACCINE

04:30:37.988 --> 04:30:39.356
IF THEY HAD A SEIZURE.

04:30:39.423 --> 04:30:48.665
OR NERVOUS IN JURY OR SEVERE

04:30:48.732 --> 04:30:49.232
EXAM OR ANY OTHER KINDS OF

04:30:49.299 --> 04:30:51.435
DOZENS OF OTHER SEVERE REACTIONS

04:30:51.501 --> 04:30:53.971
SO THAT'S ALL UNDER SB TWO SEVEN

04:30:54.037 --> 04:30:54.605
SEVEN AND THAT'S TIME PRACTICING

04:30:54.671 --> 04:30:54.805
NOW.

04:30:54.871 --> 04:30:56.006
MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS

04:30:56.073 --> 04:30:56.506
IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERY

04:30:56.573 --> 04:30:57.708
EXEMPTION I'VE EVER DONE UNDER

04:30:57.774 --> 04:30:58.942
THOSE GUIDELINES WHICH ARE NOT

04:30:59.009 --> 04:31:00.444
RESTRICTED TO CDC COUNTRY

04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:01.845
NEGATIONS.

04:31:01.912 --> 04:31:02.646
UNDER THOSE ALL GUIDELINES THEY

04:31:02.713 --> 04:31:04.514
CAN NOW REVIEW EVERY SINGLE ONE

04:31:04.581 --> 04:31:05.215
OF MY EXEMPTIONS OF TIME AND

04:31:05.282 --> 04:31:06.183
JUST QUALIFY EACH AND EVERYONE

04:31:06.249 --> 04:31:07.217
OF THEM.

04:31:07.284 --> 04:31:08.552
AND KICK THOSE KIDS OUT OF

04:31:08.619 --> 04:31:09.653
SCHOOL THEY'RE SORT OF RETRO

04:31:09.720 --> 04:31:12.122
ACTIVELY CHANGING THE GUIDELINES

04:31:12.189 --> 04:31:13.790
ALL THE EXAMPLES I'VE EVER DONE

04:31:13.857 --> 04:31:15.492
AND OTHER POSITIONS OF EVER DONE.

04:31:15.559 --> 04:31:17.027
AND TO ME THAT'S A VERY VERY

04:31:17.094 --> 04:31:19.029
CONCERNING PRECEDENT FOR

04:31:19.096 --> 04:31:20.931
GOVERNMENT TO GO BACK LIKE THAT

04:31:20.998 --> 04:31:22.733
AND THE GATE YEARS OF MEDICAL

04:31:22.799 --> 04:31:23.734
CARE THAT'S BEEN DONE.

04:31:23.800 --> 04:31:25.802
LEGALLY AND PROPERLY UNDER THE

04:31:25.869 --> 04:31:27.437
GUIDELINES OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN SO

04:31:27.504 --> 04:31:29.706
IT IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH LEAST

04:31:29.773 --> 04:31:30.674
FROM.

04:31:30.741 --> 04:31:33.410
SOME OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA -- AND

04:31:33.477 --> 04:31:34.878
THAT THAT IS PUBLIC RECORDS

04:31:34.945 --> 04:31:36.580
PEOPLE POSTED THAT THERE ARE

04:31:36.647 --> 04:31:39.950
SOME DOCTORS -- WHO ARE -- A

04:31:40.017 --> 04:31:41.618
TAKING MONEY AND WRITING MEDICAL

04:31:41.685 --> 04:31:42.786
EXCEPTIONS IT SEEMS PRETTY

04:31:42.853 --> 04:31:44.921
CLEARLY IS THE PUBLISHER OF HAVE

04:31:44.988 --> 04:31:45.722
DISCLOSED THAT.

04:31:45.789 --> 04:31:47.658
AM I AM AND MY SENSE IS THAT'S

04:31:47.724 --> 04:31:49.226
EXACTLY WHAT THE AUTHOR IS

04:31:49.292 --> 04:31:51.628
TRYING TO SOLVE A FOR OUR OUR

04:31:51.695 --> 04:31:53.830
OUR SOME UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS

04:31:53.897 --> 04:31:56.233
THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE A CHECK --

04:31:56.299 --> 04:31:56.933
TO RIDE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

04:31:57.000 --> 04:31:59.269
BECAUSE THAT -- THAT THAT WAS.

04:31:59.336 --> 04:32:02.205
NOT THE POINT OF OF TWO SEVEN

04:32:02.272 --> 04:32:03.807
SEVEN SO HOW DO WE CREATE THEN A

04:32:03.874 --> 04:32:06.109
NEW RULE OR NEW STANDARD AND I'M

04:32:06.176 --> 04:32:07.477

04:32:08.145 --> 04:32:09.046
AUTHOR THEN.

04:32:09.112 --> 04:32:10.480
HOW DO WE CREATE A STANDARD NO

04:32:10.547 --> 04:32:11.948
THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE SOME

04:32:12.015 --> 04:32:15.185
DOCTORS THAT ARE NOT DOING THIS --

04:32:15.252 --> 04:32:16.720
JUST OF FOR A PROFIT MAKING

04:32:16.787 --> 04:32:20.724
SCHEME -- AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE

04:32:20.791 --> 04:32:21.358
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SOLVE FOR

04:32:21.425 --> 04:32:22.559

WILL TELL YOU WHAT I DO

04:32:24.594 --> 04:32:25.929
PERSONALLY AS I CHARGE.

04:32:25.996 --> 04:32:27.864
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR

04:32:27.931 --> 04:32:29.433
PATIENTS WHO I SEE FOR A MEDICAL

04:32:29.499 --> 04:32:31.535
EXEMPTION AS I DO FOR NEW

04:32:31.601 --> 04:32:32.836
PATIENTS COMING IN TO ME FOR A

04:32:32.903 --> 04:32:33.603
CHECK UP.

04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:35.605

MEDICAL EXEMPTION BY MINUTES

04:32:44.014 --> 04:32:45.182
ANYTHING ELSE.

04:32:45.248 --> 04:32:46.717

JUST SAYING.

04:32:50.220 --> 04:32:51.855
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING THIS IN A

04:32:51.922 --> 04:32:53.290
VERY SCRUPULOUS WAY I DO NOT

ADVERTISE FORT I DON'T ADVERTISE

04:32:55.625 --> 04:32:57.027

HAVE A WEST SO I'M GONNA MAKE

04:32:58.462 --> 04:32:59.396
THE ASSUMPTION AND ASK YOU I'M

04:32:59.463 --> 04:33:00.430

YOU'RE A GREAT DOCTOR AND YOU DO

04:33:02.199 --> 04:33:02.766
A GOOD.

04:33:02.833 --> 04:33:11.742
WORK AND THE TH THE THE THAT YOU

04:33:11.808 --> 04:33:13.610

THAT ARE DOING IT FOR THE

04:33:14.411 --> 04:33:14.878
PURPOSE OF MAKING MONEY.

04:33:14.945 --> 04:33:16.546
LET'S MAKE THAT THIS JUST AT THE

04:33:16.613 --> 04:33:17.647
ASSUME THAT THERE ARE BECAUSE I

04:33:17.714 --> 04:33:18.515

04:33:20.951 --> 04:33:21.384
THIS JUST MAKING MONEY.

04:33:21.451 --> 04:33:23.053
HOW FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE --

04:33:23.120 --> 04:33:24.087
HOW WOULD YOU PUT TOGETHER SOME

04:33:24.154 --> 04:33:25.856
GUIDELINES OR HOW WOULD YOU COME

04:33:25.922 --> 04:33:28.291

BE ABLE TO SOLVE FOR THAT?

04:33:29.426 --> 04:33:31.061

IT'S IN YOUR PURVIEW IN THIS LAW --

04:33:46.276 --> 04:33:46.943
TO CREATE SOME SORT OF

04:33:47.010 --> 04:33:48.912
GUIDELINES WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT

04:33:48.979 --> 04:33:50.781

04:34:36.593 --> 04:34:37.160
JUST SAYING THAT WE KNOW THERE

04:34:37.227 --> 04:34:38.595
ARE SOME DOCTORS.

04:34:38.662 --> 04:34:39.629
AND I ALSO THINK THAT'S PROBABLY

04:34:39.696 --> 04:34:41.264
WHY THE THAT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

04:34:41.331 --> 04:34:43.433
ASSOCIATION CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT

04:34:43.500 --> 04:34:45.468
THIS ISSUES AND FORTUNATELY

04:34:45.535 --> 04:34:46.203
THERE ARE THAT THEIR THEIR

04:34:46.269 --> 04:34:47.270
REPUTATION IS ON THE LINE

04:34:47.337 --> 04:34:49.339
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SOME DOCTORS

04:34:49.406 --> 04:34:52.809
THAT ARE -- THAT THAT THAT ARE --

04:34:52.876 --> 04:34:53.877
USING THIS IS A PROFIT MAKING

04:34:53.944 --> 04:34:56.046
SCHEME I MEAN IT IS PRETTY CLEAR

04:34:56.112 --> 04:34:56.780
THE EVIDENCE.

04:34:56.847 --> 04:34:58.348
AND THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES HAVE

04:34:58.415 --> 04:35:01.284
THE AUTHORITY TO TO LOOK INTO

04:35:01.351 --> 04:35:01.852
THAT AND INVESTIGATE DOCTORS

04:35:01.918 --> 04:35:02.953
BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL

04:35:03.019 --> 04:35:13.730
PRACTICES THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE

04:35:13.797 --> 04:35:13.930
STOP.

04:35:13.997 --> 04:35:14.998
THEY COULD TAKE A YOU'RE RIGHT

04:35:15.065 --> 04:35:17.167
YOU COULD ALSO CREATE GUIDELINES

04:35:17.234 --> 04:35:18.835
FOR US THAT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

04:35:18.902 --> 04:35:20.403
TO FOLLOW RIGHT.

WE ARE ESTABLISHING IN THIS --

04:35:24.641 --> 04:35:26.476
BELL GUIDELINES -- FOR OVERSIGHT --

04:35:26.543 --> 04:35:27.077
WE'VE HEARD ALREADY FROM THE

04:35:27.143 --> 04:35:27.611
MEDICAL BOARD ABOUT THEIR

04:35:27.677 --> 04:35:28.178
CHALLENGES I WOULD POINT OUT

04:35:28.245 --> 04:35:29.012
THAT TO ACTUALLY THE ONE PERSON

04:35:29.079 --> 04:35:29.746
MEDICAL BOARD HAS -- ACTUALLY

04:35:29.813 --> 04:35:31.381
PUT ON PROBATION FOR IN A

04:35:31.448 --> 04:35:33.316

04:38:55.185 --> 04:38:57.620
YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN WHO'S NOT THE

04:38:57.687 --> 04:38:58.588
NORMAL SAYS THE OTHER NOR THE

04:38:58.655 --> 04:38:59.956
REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN

04:39:00.023 --> 04:39:01.491
FOR THAT CHILD.

04:39:01.558 --> 04:39:04.060
RIGHT AND YOU'RE SUBMITTING AN

04:39:04.127 --> 04:39:05.795
EXEMPTION THAT -- WELL FIRST OF

04:39:05.862 --> 04:39:06.996
ALL YOU HAVE TO TEST WITH YOU

THERE'S A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR.

04:39:16.706 --> 04:39:17.240
FOR RIGHT.

04:39:17.307 --> 04:39:18.475
WE ALSO HAVE TO TEST YOU

04:39:18.541 --> 04:39:20.243
ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE CHILD -- I

04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:21.478
THINK THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES

04:39:21.544 --> 04:39:24.881
THAT -- THAT COMES UP AS WE FOR

04:39:24.948 --> 04:39:25.748
THE WE KNOW THAT THAT PEOPLE

04:39:25.815 --> 04:39:26.516
HAVE BEEN GRANTED MEDICAL

04:39:26.583 --> 04:39:27.450
EXEMPTIONS SIMPLY THROUGH AN

04:39:27.517 --> 04:39:29.786
INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING ONLINE

04:39:29.853 --> 04:39:30.520
THAT THEY'VE NEVER EXAMINED THE

04:39:30.587 --> 04:39:32.489
CHILD -- IF YOU NEED TO HAVE AN

04:39:32.555 --> 04:39:34.891
ON GOING RELATIONSHIP AS WELL SO

04:39:34.958 --> 04:39:36.392
I MEAN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE

04:39:36.459 --> 04:39:38.862
ASSEMBLY ASK FOR THAT -- I AGREE

04:39:38.928 --> 04:39:41.831
WITH BECAUSE WHEN WE PASSED TWO

04:39:41.898 --> 04:39:42.699
SEVEN SEVEN AGAIN AS I MENTIONED

04:39:42.765 --> 04:39:43.833
WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCH THE

04:39:43.900 --> 04:39:45.034
MEDICAL EXEMPTION.

04:39:45.101 --> 04:39:46.536
BUT WHAT WE OUR EXPECTATION IS

04:39:46.603 --> 04:39:47.704
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR

04:39:47.770 --> 04:39:49.339
CHILD'S REGULAR DOCTOR WHO KNOWS

04:39:49.405 --> 04:39:50.607
THE CHILD HE'S GRANTING THEM AND

04:39:50.673 --> 04:39:52.342
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS IS THAT.

04:39:52.408 --> 04:39:54.444
ACTUALLY WE HAVE PHYSICIANS AND

04:39:54.511 --> 04:39:55.979
OF THE MEDICAL WORDS THAT'S THE

04:39:56.045 --> 04:39:56.946
CASE YOU HAVE A PHYSICIAN AND

04:39:57.013 --> 04:39:58.815
ANTI AGING CLINIC -- DOESN'T

04:39:58.882 --> 04:39:59.983
REALLY TAKE YOUR PEDIATRICS WHO

04:40:00.049 --> 04:40:01.050
IS WRITING A LOT OF MEDICAL

04:40:01.117 --> 04:40:02.585
EXEMPTIONS IN THE MEDICAL WORTH

04:40:02.652 --> 04:40:04.187
LOOKING INTO THAT WE SAW IN SAN

04:40:04.254 --> 04:40:05.488
DIEGO YOUR PHYSICIANS WHO DON'T

04:40:05.555 --> 04:40:06.789
NORMALLY TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN I

04:40:06.856 --> 04:40:07.790
KNOW DOCTOR SEARS HIMSELF AS A

04:40:07.857 --> 04:40:08.591
PEDIATRICIAN.

04:40:08.658 --> 04:40:10.660
BUT WE HAVE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE

04:40:10.727 --> 04:40:11.461
NOT REALLY THE PRIMARY CARE

04:40:11.528 --> 04:40:12.795
DOCTOR AND YEAH I THINK THIS

04:40:12.862 --> 04:40:14.631
IDEA OF HAVING MEDICAL EXEMPTION

04:40:14.697 --> 04:40:15.632
VISITS KIND OF INTRIGUING

04:40:15.698 --> 04:40:16.766
BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T REALLY

04:40:16.833 --> 04:40:18.701
HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION VISITS

04:40:18.768 --> 04:40:19.969
YOU EITHER YOUR DOCTOR YOU'RE

04:40:20.036 --> 04:40:20.970
NOT IN YOUR DOCTOR YOU SHOULD

04:40:21.037 --> 04:40:21.971

PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE

04:42:54.090 --> 04:42:56.459

MAKE SENSE AND THAT REALLY ARE

04:42:58.761 --> 04:43:00.196
FRAUDULENT.

PEOPLE SAID THAT YOU MAY WANT TO

04:43:12.208 --> 04:43:13.876
FARM YOUR FIRST DRAFT AND I DID

04:43:13.943 --> 04:43:15.812

04:43:15.878 --> 04:43:17.280
CONCERNS THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND

04:43:17.347 --> 04:43:20.116
AND APPRECIATE THE CHANGES THAT

04:43:20.183 --> 04:43:20.683
YOU PUT FOR THAT.

04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:22.151
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE BUT FOR THE

04:43:22.218 --> 04:43:23.953
GOVERNOR BEFORE -- I KNOW YOU'RE

04:43:24.020 --> 04:43:25.488
NOT GONNA RE SURE A LOT OF

04:43:25.555 --> 04:43:26.889
PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY

04:43:26.956 --> 04:43:28.191
ABOUT THIS BUT I WANT TO GIVE

04:43:28.257 --> 04:43:29.992
YOU ONE MORE CHANCE TO TALK WITH

04:43:30.059 --> 04:43:31.828
THIS THE BIG PICTURE.

04:43:31.894 --> 04:43:34.797
THAT THAT WILL WHERE YOU STARTED.

04:43:34.864 --> 04:43:37.233
AND THE CONCERNS THE MAIN

04:43:37.300 --> 04:43:38.868
CONCERNS OF I HEARD PEOPLE

04:43:38.935 --> 04:43:39.469
COMING IN MY OFFICE SAYING.

04:43:39.535 --> 04:43:41.938
THE CDC POLICY IS TOO NARROW

04:43:42.004 --> 04:43:42.338
IT'S TOO NARROW.

04:43:42.405 --> 04:43:43.106
AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER

04:43:43.172 --> 04:43:44.841
EXAMPLES THAT WE SHOULD --

04:43:44.907 --> 04:43:49.512
BROADENED THE SCOPE TO MAKE SURE

04:43:49.579 --> 04:43:50.813
THAT TRUE.

04:43:50.880 --> 04:43:53.015
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM ONCE

04:43:53.082 --> 04:43:54.817
DOCTOR NOT DOCTOR SHOPPING

04:43:54.884 --> 04:43:56.219
DOCTOR BUT A TRUE DOCTOR CAN

04:43:56.285 --> 04:43:57.920
EVALUATE AND CAN PROVIDE TO THE

04:43:57.987 --> 04:43:59.088
STATE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE

04:43:59.155 --> 04:43:59.655
APPROVED.

04:43:59.722 --> 04:44:00.957
SO IF YOU WOULD GIVE.

04:44:01.023 --> 04:44:01.891
US ONE MORE CHANCE TO OUTLINE

04:44:01.958 --> 04:44:02.992
HOW YOU THINK THAT.

04:44:03.059 --> 04:44:05.228
THAT THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN

04:44:05.294 --> 04:44:07.230
THE VERSION BEFORE US TODAY YES.

04:44:07.296 --> 04:44:09.899
SO AGAIN WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

04:44:09.966 --> 04:44:12.969
SAYS THAT -- CERTAINLY REFERS TO

04:44:13.036 --> 04:44:16.873
A SAID A C. I. P. C. C. WHICH IS

04:44:16.939 --> 04:44:17.740
AN EVIDENCE BASED.

04:44:17.807 --> 04:44:18.408
APPROACH IT ALSO HAS THE

04:44:18.474 --> 04:44:20.109
AMERICAN CAB PEDIATRICS WHICH IS

04:44:20.176 --> 04:44:22.278
A NON GOVERNMENTAL IT'S

04:44:22.345 --> 04:44:23.880
PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY.

04:44:23.946 --> 04:44:26.149
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION -- AND

04:44:26.215 --> 04:44:27.817
THEN WE ALSO STATE STANDARD OF

04:44:27.884 --> 04:44:30.186
CARE WHICH MEANS THAT IS IF

04:44:30.253 --> 04:44:31.320
THAT'S SOMETHING RECENTLY DONE

04:44:31.387 --> 04:44:33.389
BY PHYSICIAN AND CALIFORNIA ARE

04:44:33.456 --> 04:44:35.024
IN THAT COMMUNITY.

04:44:35.091 --> 04:44:37.593
THEN THAT WOULD BE SIR VALID.

04:44:37.660 --> 04:44:40.129
AND I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW

04:44:40.196 --> 04:44:40.797
WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS WHY

04:44:40.863 --> 04:44:43.733
KEEP KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL.

04:44:43.800 --> 04:44:44.767
AND IN FACT THE REASON WE'RE

04:44:44.834 --> 04:44:46.502
DOING IT TARGET APPROACH --

04:44:46.569 --> 04:44:47.770
WHICH WAS ON REGIONAL BILL BUT I

04:44:47.837 --> 04:44:49.505
CERTAINLY WAS AGREEABLE TO THAT --

04:44:49.572 --> 04:44:51.374
FOR BOTH -- THE GOVERNOR AND

04:44:51.441 --> 04:44:53.709
FROM -- THIS ASSEMBLY IS IS THAT

04:44:53.776 --> 04:44:56.145
WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS SAY

04:44:56.212 --> 04:44:57.880
NO WE WANT YOUR KIDS ARE SAFE AT

04:44:57.947 --> 04:45:00.116
SCHOOL SO THE SCHOOL IS ABOVE

04:45:00.183 --> 04:45:00.750
THE THRESHOLD.

04:45:00.817 --> 04:45:01.884
YOU KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

04:45:01.951 --> 04:45:03.719
EXEMPTION MIGHT NOT BE VALID OR

04:45:03.786 --> 04:45:04.987
NOT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

04:45:05.054 --> 04:45:06.956
SCHOOL SAFE -- THE KIDS WHO HAVE

04:45:07.023 --> 04:45:08.291
THE EXEMPTIONS WHO NEED

04:45:08.357 --> 04:45:09.892
EXEMPTION STILL BE OKAY RIGHT

04:45:09.959 --> 04:45:11.561
THERE'S A HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL OF

04:45:11.627 --> 04:45:12.395
PROTECTION.

04:45:12.462 --> 04:45:14.897
BUT IF IT DROPS BELOW THAT.

04:45:14.964 --> 04:45:16.265
WELL WE KNOW THERE'S SOME KIDS

04:45:16.332 --> 04:45:17.900
WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE EXEMPTIONS

04:45:17.967 --> 04:45:19.235
AND WE NEED TO KEEP THEM SAFE

04:45:19.302 --> 04:45:21.170
RIGHT AND SO THE KIDS WHO HAVE A

04:45:21.237 --> 04:45:22.672
LEGEND EXEMPTIONS WE NEED TO

04:45:22.738 --> 04:45:23.673
KEEP THEM SAFE AND SO WE GOT

04:45:23.739 --> 04:45:24.974
LOOK AT WELL WHO ALSO HAVE

04:45:25.041 --> 04:45:26.008
EXEMPTIONS AND SOME OF THEM

04:45:26.075 --> 04:45:27.210
DON'T HAVE IT.

04:45:27.276 --> 04:45:28.644
WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T KEEP

04:45:28.711 --> 04:45:30.480
THEM BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY

04:45:30.546 --> 04:45:31.314
ENDANGERING THE ONES WHO REALLY

04:45:31.380 --> 04:45:33.349
NEED IT NOW I ALSO POINT OUT

04:45:33.416 --> 04:45:37.153
THAT -- THE IDEA IS IS THAT.

04:45:37.220 --> 04:45:38.554
WHEN WE SAY STANDARD OF CARE AND

04:45:38.621 --> 04:45:39.822
AND WHAT'S REASONABLE FOR A

04:45:39.889 --> 04:45:41.424
POSITION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW

04:45:41.491 --> 04:45:44.527
THAT THE GOAL IS NOT TO SAY THAT

04:45:44.594 --> 04:45:44.727
WILL?

04:45:44.794 --> 04:45:48.331
DILATES NOT ABOUT PROVING -- THE

04:45:48.397 --> 04:45:51.100
THE SAYING THAT -- YOU HAVE TO

04:45:51.167 --> 04:45:52.235
PROVE THE VACCINE BECAUSE THE

04:45:52.301 --> 04:45:53.903
PROBLEM RIGHT SO SOMETHING

04:45:53.970 --> 04:45:55.471
HAPPENED RELATED AND YOU THINK

04:45:55.538 --> 04:45:56.405
IT'S RELATED ACCEDE.

04:45:56.472 --> 04:45:57.940
YEAH IT IT'S NOT ABOUT SAYING

04:45:58.007 --> 04:45:58.875
THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THE

04:45:58.941 --> 04:46:00.643
VACCINE CAUSED IT I THINK IT'S

04:46:00.710 --> 04:46:04.247
REALLY MORE ABOUT SAYING WELL IF

04:46:04.313 --> 04:46:05.314
YOU HAVE A CONDITION.

04:46:05.381 --> 04:46:06.582
AND LET'S LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE

04:46:06.649 --> 04:46:07.984
AND IF WE CAN SAY THAT THAT

04:46:08.050 --> 04:46:09.485
ACTUALLY CONDITIONS BEEN CAUSED

04:46:09.552 --> 04:46:10.253
BY SOMETHING ELSE NOT THE

04:46:10.319 --> 04:46:12.622
VACCINE WE SHOULD ACCEPT THAT.

04:46:12.688 --> 04:46:14.557
OR IF WE'VE ACTUALLY DISPROVED

04:46:14.624 --> 04:46:16.359
THAT THE VACCINE ANYTHING TO DO

04:46:16.425 --> 04:46:18.161
WITH IT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION.

04:46:18.227 --> 04:46:20.496
THE THAT WE CAN'T DISPROVE

04:46:20.563 --> 04:46:21.297
VACCINE DIDN'T BECAUSE IT.

04:46:21.364 --> 04:46:22.498
OF ANY WE CAN'T PROVE THE

04:46:22.565 --> 04:46:24.100
VACCINE DIDN'T BECAUSE IT OR WE

04:46:24.166 --> 04:46:25.568
CAN'T PROVE THAT THE THING THAT

04:46:25.635 --> 04:46:27.136
HAPPENED HAD SOMETHING THAT WAS

04:46:27.203 --> 04:46:28.638
THAT WAS THAT WAS DUE TO

04:46:28.704 --> 04:46:29.805
SOMETHING VERY SPECIFICALLY NOT

04:46:29.872 --> 04:46:31.107
THE VACCINE.

04:46:31.173 --> 04:46:32.775
AND SO THAT MEANS THAT MAYBE IT

04:46:32.842 --> 04:46:34.176
COULD BE THE VACCINE THEN WE'D

04:46:34.243 --> 04:46:35.845
PROBABLY SAY OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT.

04:46:35.912 --> 04:46:37.213
LET'S LET'S GIVE THEM THE

04:46:37.280 --> 04:46:38.347
BENEFIT THE DOWN SAY IT COULD BE

04:46:38.414 --> 04:46:40.383
THE VACCINE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN

04:46:40.449 --> 04:46:41.851
IT IS BUT LET'S GIVE THE BENEFIT

04:46:41.918 --> 04:46:43.519
DOWN SAID SO MUCH TO GET THE

04:46:43.586 --> 04:46:44.220
THEIR EXEMPTION.

04:46:44.287 --> 04:46:45.955
BECAUSE WE KEEP WE'RE NOT SURE

04:46:46.022 --> 04:46:47.256
WHAT WHAT REALLY BECAUSE IT AND

04:46:47.323 --> 04:46:49.425
THAT IT'S IT AND WE CAN'T THIS

04:46:49.492 --> 04:46:50.960
PROVES THE VACCINE AND WE CAN'T

04:46:51.027 --> 04:46:52.562
PROVE IT SOMETHING ELSE.

04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:53.963

PROTEST THIS VACCINE -- ACTUALLY

04:47:02.438 --> 04:47:04.073
IT THE I LIKE THIS IS WITHIN THE

04:47:04.140 --> 04:47:05.107
CDC GUIDELINES I KNOW WE'RE

04:47:05.174 --> 04:47:05.675
GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW A

04:47:05.741 --> 04:47:08.010
LITTLE BEYOND BUT EVEN THE CDC

04:47:08.077 --> 04:47:08.778
GUIDELINES OR TERMS IS TOO

04:47:08.844 --> 04:47:10.746
NARROW ACTUALLY SAYS IF YOU GET

04:47:10.813 --> 04:47:11.647

04:47:11.714 --> 04:47:14.250

CAN'T SHOW IT'S CAUSED BY

04:47:17.987 --> 04:47:19.889
SOMETHING ELSE LIKE I THAT IS

04:47:19.956 --> 04:47:20.756
THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID

04:47:20.823 --> 04:47:21.724
YOUR NECK THAT'S A MASON FROM

04:47:21.791 --> 04:47:22.325
THE NO IT DOESN'T COUNT IF WE

04:47:22.391 --> 04:47:23.359
CAN SAYIT'S ACTUALLY CAUSED BY

04:47:23.426 --> 04:47:24.927
SOMETHING IT'S NOT THE VACCINE.

04:47:24.994 --> 04:47:26.228
THEN OF COURSE WOULD SAY IT'S

04:47:26.295 --> 04:47:33.669
NOT REALLY TO THE VACCINE BUT WE

04:47:33.736 --> 04:47:34.737
CAN'T SAY DOUBTS.

04:47:34.804 --> 04:47:35.271
THEN.

04:47:35.338 --> 04:47:36.038
YOU'D QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL

04:47:36.606 --> 04:47:37.740
GUIDELINES WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

04:47:37.807 --> 04:47:38.341
COSTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE

04:47:38.407 --> 04:47:38.941
VACCINE BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT'S

04:47:39.008 --> 04:47:39.308

EXEMPTION ON THAT VACCINE SO --

04:47:44.180 --> 04:47:46.148
SO THAT IS THE WAY THAT -- THIS

04:47:46.215 --> 04:47:47.750
THIS WORKS WE WHAT WE WANT TO

04:47:47.817 --> 04:47:48.784
GIVE AS MUCH LATITUDE AS

04:47:48.851 --> 04:47:50.186
POSSIBLE WHILE STILL BEING SURE

04:47:50.252 --> 04:47:51.520
RECOGNIZED WITH EVERY EXEMPTION

04:47:51.587 --> 04:47:52.688
WE GIVE.

04:47:52.755 --> 04:47:53.889
WE ALSO WEAKENING THE COMEDIAN

04:47:53.956 --> 04:47:55.324
UNITY IN THE SCHOOL AND THAT'S

04:47:55.391 --> 04:47:57.827
FINE AS LONG AS WE'RE AS LONG AS

04:47:57.893 --> 04:47:59.428
WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T

04:47:59.495 --> 04:48:01.063
WANT FIRST PRIORITY IS TO BE

04:48:01.130 --> 04:48:03.032
SURE WE KEEP THAT CHILD SAFE AND

04:48:03.099 --> 04:48:03.966
THEN BE SURE WE KEEP THE SCHOOL

04:48:04.033 --> 04:48:05.101
SAFE SO THERE'S ANY CONCERN.

04:48:05.167 --> 04:48:06.369
THE VACCINE MIGHT BE WHAT'S

04:48:06.435 --> 04:48:08.170
CAUSING THE PROBLEM EVEN IF WE

04:48:08.237 --> 04:48:09.305
CAN'T PROVE IT.

04:48:09.372 --> 04:48:10.139
OKAY LET'S GIVE THE MEDICAL

04:48:10.206 --> 04:48:12.441
EXEMPTION BUT IF WE CAN SAY WELL

04:48:12.508 --> 04:48:13.843
YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IT'S NOT

04:48:13.909 --> 04:48:15.778
THE VACCINE THAT WE KNOW ITS --

04:48:15.845 --> 04:48:18.347
THEN ITHINK WOULD HAVE TO SAY

04:48:18.414 --> 04:48:21.817
SO A OCT WE HEARD A COUPLE

04:48:21.884 --> 04:48:24.186
PEOPLE SAY AUTISM.

04:48:24.253 --> 04:48:25.054
ALRIGHT WE'VE HEARD A COUPLE

04:48:25.121 --> 04:48:27.023
PEOPLE TESTIFY AND SAY AUTISM

04:48:27.089 --> 04:48:28.658
AND BUT THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE

04:48:28.724 --> 04:48:29.492
RESEARCH TO SHOW THERE'S NO SAYS

04:48:29.558 --> 04:48:30.626
HE ASIAN BETWEEN VACCINES AND

04:48:30.693 --> 04:48:31.060
AUTISM.

04:48:31.127 --> 04:48:32.294
VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM

04:48:32.361 --> 04:48:33.829
RIGHT THERE'S BEEN NUMEROUS

04:48:33.896 --> 04:48:35.398
STUDIES IS THAT IT TO THE ALL

04:48:35.464 --> 04:48:36.666

04:48:36.732 --> 04:48:37.667
THAT.

04:48:37.733 --> 04:48:39.769
SOME PEOPLE MAY STILL WANT TO

04:48:39.835 --> 04:48:41.170
SEE HIM WITH HEARD SOME PEOPLE

04:48:41.237 --> 04:48:42.371

BE REALLY DIRECT THE EVIDENCE

04:48:50.546 --> 04:48:51.047
DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT WE'VE

04:48:51.113 --> 04:48:52.148
THAT'S BEEN STUDIED AND BEEN

04:48:52.214 --> 04:48:52.581
EXAMINED.

04:48:52.648 --> 04:48:53.649
NOW THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT

04:48:53.716 --> 04:48:54.884
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AND WE SHOULD

04:48:54.950 --> 04:48:56.686
GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT

04:48:56.752 --> 04:48:58.254

04:52:27.963 --> 04:52:30.466
AND IT EXEMPTS DEPARTMENT OF

04:52:30.532 --> 04:52:32.234
PUBLIC HEALTH AND AGED JUST FROM

THE BILL.

04:52:38.173 --> 04:52:41.010
SO MIKE MY QUESTION BASICALLY IS.

04:52:41.076 --> 04:52:43.045
THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE

04:52:43.112 --> 04:52:44.647

04:52:52.688 --> 04:52:54.123
REGULATIONS A CLEAR.

NECESSARY AND LEGALLY VALID.

04:52:57.326 --> 04:52:59.628
BY BY PASSING THE ADMINISTRATIVE

04:52:59.695 --> 04:53:01.330
PROCEDURE ACT THE BILL WOULD

04:53:01.397 --> 04:53:02.498
DENY PARENTS AND OTHER

04:53:02.564 --> 04:53:03.799

OPPORTUNITY. TO WEIGH IN ON

04:53:06.402 --> 04:53:07.836
IMPLEMENTATION OF A LAW.

04:53:07.903 --> 04:53:10.506
THE COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR

04:53:10.572 --> 04:53:12.341
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SO I'M JUST

04:53:12.408 --> 04:53:14.009
WONDERING WHY.

04:53:14.076 --> 04:53:17.279

04:53:20.015 --> 04:53:23.485
THE PURPOSE OF THAT. FIVE TO

04:53:23.552 --> 04:53:24.520
LEAVE THAT UP.

04:53:24.586 --> 04:53:25.287
TO NOW THANK THANK YOU I BELIEVE

04:53:25.354 --> 04:53:26.956
THAT -- WAS PART OF DISCUSSION

04:53:27.022 --> 04:53:28.490
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

04:53:28.557 --> 04:53:31.026
TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

04:53:31.093 --> 04:53:34.296
OF THIS -- PARTICULAR BILL AND

04:53:34.363 --> 04:53:36.432
SO THAT'S THAT THIS IS BY WAY

04:53:36.498 --> 04:53:39.301
THAT THIS IS NOT UNIQUE -- I'VE

04:53:39.368 --> 04:53:41.170
SAYS CHAIR OF BOTH THIS HEALTH

04:53:41.236 --> 04:53:42.938
COMMITTEE PREVIOUSLY AND NOW IN

04:53:43.005 --> 04:53:47.042
THE SENATE AT THAT ESPECIALLY

04:53:47.109 --> 04:53:48.277
WHEN -- WE HAVE -- ISSUES THAT

04:53:48.344 --> 04:53:49.411
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH MORE

04:53:49.478 --> 04:53:50.913
RAPIDLY -- THE THIS IS

04:53:50.980 --> 04:53:52.715
FREQUENTLY A PROVISION THAT IS

04:53:52.781 --> 04:53:54.717
IN -- THOSE BILLS TO ALLOW THE

04:53:54.783 --> 04:53:58.053
DEPARTMENT TO ACT MORE QUICKLY.

04:53:58.120 --> 04:54:00.422
CORRECT SO IF THEY COME OUT WITH

04:54:00.489 --> 04:54:02.424
THE GUIDELINES THAN ME OR THEIR

04:54:02.491 --> 04:54:05.894
PROCESS.

04:54:05.961 --> 04:54:06.662
IF THEY COME OUT WITH IT AND

04:54:06.729 --> 04:54:08.397
THEN THAT'S IT THERE'S NO.

04:54:08.464 --> 04:54:12.267
COMMENTS ON THAT THERE'S NO.

04:54:12.334 --> 04:54:13.902
WE WILL CERTAINLY PEOPLE.

04:54:13.969 --> 04:54:15.437
DID YOU WANT ME.

04:54:15.504 --> 04:54:17.706
TO YOU KNOW I I THINK DOCTOR PAN

04:54:17.773 --> 04:54:18.941
WAS CORRECT I MEAN THERE I

04:54:19.008 --> 04:54:20.242
BELIEVE THERE IS AN URGENCY TO

04:54:20.309 --> 04:54:21.877
THIS AND I THINK THAT'S THAT IS

04:54:21.944 --> 04:54:22.878
PART OF THE REASON THAT IT'S

04:54:22.945 --> 04:54:24.313
DRAFTED THIS WAY.

04:54:24.380 --> 04:54:25.447
BUT IT BUT IF THERE IS A

04:54:25.514 --> 04:54:27.216
CHALLENGE THESE ARE NOT THESE

04:54:27.282 --> 04:54:28.183
ARE REGULATIONS ARE CAN BE

04:54:28.250 --> 04:54:30.052
DEVELOPED BY THE AGENCY OF

04:54:30.119 --> 04:54:31.286
SOMETHING VOWED COMES FORWARD

04:54:31.353 --> 04:54:32.755
THERE'S NOTHING TO PRECLUDE SEE

04:54:32.821 --> 04:54:34.423
AGENCY FOR MAKING CHANGES TO THE

04:54:34.490 --> 04:54:36.058
GUIDELINES. FOR OR THE OR THE OR

04:54:36.125 --> 04:54:37.993
THE APPEAL PROCESS SO SO IT IS

04:54:38.060 --> 04:54:39.395
NOT IT IS NOT RESTRICTED THIS AT

04:54:39.461 --> 04:54:41.030
THE RIVER THE REASON WE'RE DOING

04:54:41.096 --> 04:54:43.065
THIS IN THIS WAY IS TO EXPEDITE

04:54:43.132 --> 04:54:43.999
THE PROCESS.

04:54:44.066 --> 04:54:45.167
AND FOR THE PROTECT CHILDREN

04:54:45.234 --> 04:54:46.869
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE OKAY SO

04:54:46.935 --> 04:54:47.936
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE WHEN YOU

04:54:48.003 --> 04:54:49.938
SAY MINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S

04:54:50.005 --> 04:54:51.673
OFFICE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

04:54:51.740 --> 04:54:55.244
YEAH EXTENSION OF THE GOVERNOR'S

04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.611
OFFICE CORRECT.

04:54:55.677 --> 04:54:56.645
OKAY.

04:54:56.712 --> 04:54:58.047
SO THEN THE OTHER QUESTIONS

04:54:58.113 --> 04:54:59.882
REGARDING APPEALS.

04:54:59.948 --> 04:55:00.449
AND IT JUST KIND OF BROUGHT

04:55:00.516 --> 04:55:01.483
BECAUSE OF PERSONAL THING THAT

04:55:01.550 --> 04:55:04.920
HAPPENED YOU KNOW TO MIND THAT.

04:55:04.987 --> 04:55:06.522
IT'S KIND IT'S BEEN STATED THAT

04:55:06.588 --> 04:55:08.657
THERE'S POTENTIALLY DOCTORS WHO

04:55:08.724 --> 04:55:10.259
ARE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING PATIENTS

04:55:10.325 --> 04:55:11.093
AND PER.

04:55:11.160 --> 04:55:15.631
PERSON BUT ARE WRITING EXEMPTION --

04:55:15.697 --> 04:55:18.634
SO THIS PANEL OF THE THREE

04:55:18.700 --> 04:55:20.302
DOCTOR PANEL.

04:55:20.369 --> 04:55:21.770
AND IN MY OPINION THEN SHOULD

04:55:21.837 --> 04:55:23.238
ALSO HAVE TO MEET WITH THE

04:55:23.305 --> 04:55:24.973
DOCTOR.

04:55:25.040 --> 04:55:26.742
WHO'S WRITING THE EXEMPTION.

04:55:26.809 --> 04:55:28.444
THE PATIENT OR THEIR FAMILY

04:55:28.510 --> 04:55:30.412
PRIOR TO DENYING THE EXEMPTION

04:55:30.479 --> 04:55:32.714
ALSO SO IT KIND OF GOES BOTH

04:55:32.781 --> 04:55:34.083
WAYS -- DAYS.

04:55:34.149 --> 04:55:35.984
I'M THINKING YOU KNOW IF WE'RE

04:55:36.051 --> 04:55:37.386
REQUIRING THAT THE DOCTOR WHO

04:55:37.453 --> 04:55:39.088
WRITES EXEMPTION SEES THE

04:55:39.154 --> 04:55:40.122
PATIENT WHICH I THINK IS

04:55:40.189 --> 04:55:43.025
PROBABLY A GOOD.

04:55:43.092 --> 04:55:44.960
STANDARD OF CARE ANYWAY.

04:55:45.027 --> 04:55:47.830
BUT THE PANEL WHO COULD BE

04:55:47.896 --> 04:55:49.298
REMOTE AND NOT KNOW EVERYTHING

04:55:49.364 --> 04:55:50.632
ABOUT THE PATIENT AND WHY THAT

04:55:50.699 --> 04:55:52.401
CAME TO MIND IS BECAUSE I HAD TO

04:55:52.468 --> 04:55:53.902
BRING MY SON TO THE EMERGENCY

04:55:53.969 --> 04:55:54.603
ROOM.

04:55:54.670 --> 04:55:57.372
LAST YEAR RIGHT AFTER SESSION

04:55:57.439 --> 04:55:59.241
AND HE WAS PRESENTING WITH STIFF

04:55:59.308 --> 04:56:02.111
NECK PAIN HEADACHE AND A FEVER

04:56:02.177 --> 04:56:03.412
SO THE FIRST THING WE THOUGHT OF

04:56:03.479 --> 04:56:04.680
BECAUSE IT WAS A MENINGITIS

04:56:04.746 --> 04:56:05.848
OUTBREAK GOING ON AT THIS YEAR'S

04:56:05.914 --> 04:56:06.815
DO.

04:56:06.882 --> 04:56:08.217
THAT THIS COULD BE A CONCERN AND

04:56:08.283 --> 04:56:09.852
HIS COUSIN GOES THERE AND HE WAS

04:56:09.918 --> 04:56:10.886
JUST WITH HIM.

04:56:10.953 --> 04:56:12.654
SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO THE

04:56:12.721 --> 04:56:14.490
EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THAT'S

04:56:14.556 --> 04:56:16.058
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID TO GO.

04:56:16.125 --> 04:56:18.994
AND IT TURNED OUT IT WASN'T THAT

04:56:19.061 --> 04:56:19.995
ALTHOUGH THE FIRST THING THEY

04:56:20.062 --> 04:56:22.097
DID WAS SLOT MASK ONE EVERYBODY

04:56:22.164 --> 04:56:24.199
EXCEPT ME I THINK IN A MASS BUT

04:56:24.266 --> 04:56:28.837
I WAS ALREADY EXPOSED SO -- SO

04:56:28.904 --> 04:56:29.805
IT WAS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY HE

04:56:29.872 --> 04:56:30.639
IMMEDIATELY WENT AND WITHIN

04:56:30.706 --> 04:56:32.074
MINUTES THEY DID ALL KINDS OF

04:56:32.141 --> 04:56:33.609
BLOOD WORK SWAP THIS ROAD AND

04:56:33.675 --> 04:56:35.744
EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT CAME IT

04:56:35.811 --> 04:56:37.246
WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

04:56:37.312 --> 04:56:38.514
BUDGET JUST TO MAKE A LONG STORY

04:56:38.580 --> 04:56:39.982
SHORT.

04:56:40.048 --> 04:56:42.017
HE DIDN'T HAVE MENINGITIS THE

04:56:42.084 --> 04:56:43.986
COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THEY

04:56:44.052 --> 04:56:46.421
DETERMINE A STRIP OF WAS WEIRD

04:56:46.488 --> 04:56:47.756
TYPE A STRAP NOT THE NORMAL SO

04:56:47.823 --> 04:56:48.357
ANYWAY.

04:56:48.423 --> 04:56:50.192
BUT IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE

04:56:50.259 --> 04:56:51.293
WRITTEN.

04:56:51.360 --> 04:56:52.928
THE NOTES COMING OUT IN THE

04:56:52.995 --> 04:56:54.630
EMERGENCY ROOM IT SAYS --

04:56:54.696 --> 04:56:58.567
SOMETHING VERY VAGUE LIKE FEVER

04:56:58.634 --> 04:56:59.501
SORE THROAT OR SOMETHING.

04:56:59.568 --> 04:57:01.270
SO TO ME.

04:57:01.336 --> 04:57:03.338
IF IF THERE IS A SOMETHING

04:57:03.405 --> 04:57:05.274
WRITTEN AND IT JUST KIND OF

04:57:05.340 --> 04:57:07.976
SKIMS OVER THE ISSUE DOESN'T SAY

04:57:08.043 --> 04:57:09.244
WHY I BROUGHT HIM IN THERE WHY

04:57:09.311 --> 04:57:11.914
EVERYONE TOOK IT SO SERIOUSLY OF

04:57:11.980 --> 04:57:12.614
FIRST.

04:57:12.681 --> 04:57:15.350
WE COULD EASILY BE SWAYED HAVING

04:57:15.417 --> 04:57:16.885
NOT MET WITH THE PARENTS ARE NOT

04:57:16.952 --> 04:57:18.287
MET WITH THE DOCTOR IN

04:57:18.353 --> 04:57:19.721
ATTENDANCE IN KNOW.

04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:22.691
ABOUT THAT ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S

04:57:22.758 --> 04:57:23.792
WHAT BROUGHT THAT TO MY WHAT WAS

04:57:23.859 --> 04:57:24.826
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS IS

04:57:24.893 --> 04:57:26.295
THAT -- WE DO HAVE A

04:57:26.361 --> 04:57:27.529
RESPONSIBILITY POSITIONS TO

04:57:27.596 --> 04:57:31.633
DOCUMENT ADEQUATELY -- RIGHT YOU

04:57:31.700 --> 04:57:32.167
HAVE A REASON TO DOCUMENT

04:57:32.234 --> 04:57:35.637
ADEQUATELY YES -- AND THE AND

04:57:35.704 --> 04:57:38.040
ALSO BY THE WAY THE EVEN IN THE

04:57:38.106 --> 04:57:39.708
C. P. H. REVIEW PROCESS WITH THE

04:57:39.775 --> 04:57:41.009
CLINICIANS.

04:57:41.076 --> 04:57:42.778
APART THE REASON WE WANT THAT

04:57:42.844 --> 04:57:44.646
THE ALLOW THE RECORD RELEASE --

04:57:44.713 --> 04:57:46.715
FROM THE FROM THE PARENT IS IS

04:57:46.782 --> 04:57:48.784
THAT THAT ALLOWS THE PHYSICIAN

04:57:48.850 --> 04:57:50.118
TO THEN SHARE INFORMATION

04:57:50.185 --> 04:57:52.487
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE

04:57:52.554 --> 04:57:54.356
PUBLIC HEALTH MAY SEEK SO WE WE

04:57:54.423 --> 04:57:55.224
DON'T WANT TO HAVE SOMEONE THE

04:57:55.290 --> 04:57:56.191
KNIGHTS OF THE BECAUSE THERE'S

04:57:56.258 --> 04:57:57.426
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.

04:57:57.492 --> 04:57:58.860
SO WE WANT TO CREATE AN

04:57:58.927 --> 04:58:01.096
OPPORTUNITY -- FOR IF THERE IS

04:58:01.163 --> 04:58:02.531
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO MAKE

04:58:02.598 --> 04:58:03.699
THAT JUDGMENT TO ALLOW THE

04:58:03.765 --> 04:58:05.033
PHYSICIAN WHO ACTUALLY SAW THE

04:58:05.100 --> 04:58:07.102
PATIENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

04:58:07.169 --> 04:58:09.271
INFORMATION AND THAT'S PART OF

04:58:09.338 --> 04:58:10.672
THE PROCESS BOTH NOT JUST AT THE

04:58:10.739 --> 04:58:12.441
PEEL PROCESS BUT EVEN AT THE C.

04:58:12.507 --> 04:58:15.677
PH LEVEL -- SO SO I THINK THAT

04:58:15.744 --> 04:58:17.079
THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE NORMAL

04:58:17.145 --> 04:58:18.714
PEER REVIEW PROCESS SO FOR

04:58:18.780 --> 04:58:19.982
EXAMPLE I SERVED ON THE QUALITY

04:58:20.048 --> 04:58:21.250
IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE WAS AT UC

04:58:21.316 --> 04:58:22.117
DAVIS.

04:58:22.184 --> 04:58:23.785
AND YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT WACO

04:58:23.852 --> 04:58:28.257
CRITICAL INCIDENTS THINGS WHEN

04:58:28.323 --> 04:58:29.491
THINGS DIDN'T GO RIGHT.

04:58:29.558 --> 04:58:30.325
WE DIDN'T PULL AND ALL THE

04:58:30.392 --> 04:58:30.926
FAMILIES AND EVERYTHING WHAT

04:58:30.993 --> 04:58:32.427
HAPPENS IS WE WOULD GO LOOK AT

04:58:32.494 --> 04:58:33.028
THE RECORD SOMETIMES WE THEN

04:58:33.095 --> 04:58:34.896
SEND INCREASED TO INVOLVE TO THE

04:58:34.963 --> 04:58:36.098
INVOLVE PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE

04:58:36.164 --> 04:58:36.965
THERE AND SAY.

04:58:37.032 --> 04:58:38.700
SO BASED ON THE RECORD WE STILL

04:58:38.767 --> 04:58:40.035
HAVE THESE QUESTIONS WHAT

04:58:40.102 --> 04:58:41.036
HAPPENED CAN YOU TELL US AND SO

04:58:41.103 --> 04:58:41.603
FORTH.

04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:43.972
AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE IN

04:58:44.039 --> 04:58:46.174
THIS BILL THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED

04:58:46.241 --> 04:58:48.010
THE THE PIECE WHERE IT SAYS WELL

04:58:48.076 --> 04:58:49.945
WE WANT THE PARENTS TO GIVE

04:58:50.012 --> 04:58:51.747
INFORMATION FOR BOTH THE PART

04:58:51.813 --> 04:58:52.848
THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT ALSO THE

04:58:52.914 --> 04:58:53.882
PART PUBLIC HEALTH.

04:58:53.949 --> 04:58:56.351

AND CHILDREN THAT HAVE HAD

05:01:08.917 --> 05:01:09.451
VACCINE EXAM X..

05:01:09.518 --> 05:01:10.285
VACCINE THEY HAD BACK SEEN

05:01:10.352 --> 05:01:10.819
EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE OF OUR

05:01:10.886 --> 05:01:12.821
VACCINE REACTIONS BOTH AND

05:01:12.888 --> 05:01:14.589
MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN.

05:01:14.656 --> 05:01:16.458
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX SITUATION

05:01:16.525 --> 05:01:18.226
WHERE WE ACTUALLY FOR A PORTION

05:01:18.293 --> 05:01:20.028
OF OUR EXEMPTION WE ACTUALLY

05:01:20.095 --> 05:01:22.597
QUALIFY FOR TWO OF THEM VACCINES

05:01:22.664 --> 05:01:24.766
UNDER THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS

05:01:24.833 --> 05:01:26.935
THE OTHER VACCINES WE DO NOT

05:01:27.002 --> 05:01:28.170
QUALIFY THOSE WOULD.

05:01:28.236 --> 05:01:30.205
I MOVE INTO THE CATEGORY OF THE

05:01:30.272 --> 05:01:32.874
VACCINE REACTIONS TO THOSE

05:01:32.941 --> 05:01:36.578
SPECIFIC VACCINES.

05:01:36.645 --> 05:01:38.580
AND SO WITH.

05:01:38.647 --> 05:01:39.381
WITH THAT FALLING WITHOUT AN

05:01:39.448 --> 05:01:40.582
OUTSIDE OF THE CDC CONTRA

05:01:40.649 --> 05:01:42.918
INDICATIONS.

05:01:42.984 --> 05:01:45.654
MY CONCERN IS WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY

05:01:45.720 --> 05:01:47.823
BE SEEN BY AN IMMUNOLOGIST I

05:01:47.889 --> 05:01:49.524
HAVE AN IMMUNOLOGIST BECAUSE OF

05:01:49.591 --> 05:01:51.159
MY PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY.

05:01:51.226 --> 05:01:53.395
WE WOULD BE SEEN BY THEM OR A A

05:01:53.462 --> 05:01:55.330
PEDIATRICIAN AT A LARGE HOSPITAL

05:01:55.397 --> 05:01:57.799
THAT SPECIALIZES IN IMMUNOLOGY.

05:01:57.866 --> 05:02:00.869
AND IT GETS VERY CONFUSING.

05:02:00.936 --> 05:02:01.937
AS I'M SURE I'M PROBABLY

05:02:02.003 --> 05:02:05.173
CONFUSED YOU GUYS WITH THIS --

05:02:05.240 --> 05:02:06.875
IT GETS VERY CONFUSING WHEN A

05:02:06.942 --> 05:02:08.810
VACCINE EXEMPTION OF THAT TYPE

05:02:08.877 --> 05:02:15.016
IS GIVEN AND SO WE ARE NOT

05:02:15.083 --> 05:02:17.819
SORRY -- SO WE DON'T FALL WITHIN

05:02:17.886 --> 05:02:19.087
THAT AND SO WE WOULD FALL

05:02:19.154 --> 05:02:22.357
OUTSIDE AND I THE BEST.

05:02:22.424 --> 05:02:23.124
THE BEST JUDGMENT OF THE DOCTOR

05:02:23.191 --> 05:02:25.360
AT THAT POINT TO GIVE US THAT

05:02:25.427 --> 05:02:27.362
VACCINE EXEMPTION MY FEAR WITH

05:02:27.429 --> 05:02:28.897
THOSE WITHOUT FIVE EXEMPTION

05:02:28.964 --> 05:02:30.899
ROLE IS MY IMMUNOLOGIST IS

05:02:30.966 --> 05:02:32.601
WRITING AND VACCINE EXEMPTIONS

05:02:32.667 --> 05:02:34.102
EVERY DAY FOR PRIMARY IMMUNE

05:02:34.169 --> 05:02:35.804
DEFICIENCIES THAT FALLS WITHIN

05:02:35.871 --> 05:02:37.472
THE CDC CONTRA INDICATIONS THAT

05:02:37.539 --> 05:02:38.206
THEY'RE GOING TO BE

05:02:38.273 --> 05:02:39.708
AUTOMATICALLY FLAG.

05:02:39.774 --> 05:02:41.710
AT THAT POINT.

05:02:41.776 --> 05:02:44.079
AND SO IF ALL OF THEIR VACCINE

05:02:44.145 --> 05:02:45.814
EXEMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED.

05:02:45.881 --> 05:02:48.083
THAN MINE BEING OUTSIDE OF THAT

05:02:48.149 --> 05:02:49.518
SCOPE OF THE CDC CONTRA

05:02:49.584 --> 05:02:50.852
INDICATIONS IS GOING TO BE

05:02:50.919 --> 05:02:54.389
SCRUTINIZED AND SO IN THAT CASE.

05:02:54.456 --> 05:02:55.924
WHEN MINE IS BEING LOOKED UP SO

05:02:55.991 --> 05:02:58.760
CLOSELY AND WE HAVE SUCH A?

05:02:58.827 --> 05:03:01.997
COMPLEX MEDICAL ISSUE AND AND

05:03:02.063 --> 05:03:04.499
HISTORY IN OUR FAMILY MY CONCERN

05:03:04.566 --> 05:03:06.234
IS THAT A PANEL OF THREE DOCTORS

05:03:06.301 --> 05:03:09.204
THAT ARE GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.

05:03:09.271 --> 05:03:11.339
FOR PEDIATRICIANS AREN'T GOING

05:03:11.406 --> 05:03:12.641
TO UNDERSTAND OUR COMPLEX

05:03:12.707 --> 05:03:14.376
IMMUNOLOGY ISSUE AND SO THAT'S

05:03:14.442 --> 05:03:16.311
WHERE I THINK YOU WERE ASKING

05:03:16.378 --> 05:03:18.847
THE PEER TO PEER COMMENT IS WHEN

05:03:18.914 --> 05:03:20.248
A INSURANCE COMPANY DID DIDN'T

05:03:20.315 --> 05:03:23.051
DENY IS A PEER TO PEER REVIEW.

05:03:23.118 --> 05:03:24.553
THEY ACTUALLY GET ON THE PHONE

05:03:24.619 --> 05:03:26.488
AND HAVE A CONFERENCE CALL WITH

05:03:26.555 --> 05:03:28.723
THE DOCTOR THAT WROTE THAT IN SO

05:03:28.790 --> 05:03:29.991
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

05:03:30.058 --> 05:03:32.427
ASKING FOR IS FOR THAT PEER TO

05:03:32.494 --> 05:03:33.762
PEER REVIEW TO BE.

05:03:33.828 --> 05:03:36.498
REAL TIME LIVE WITH THAT DOCTOR

05:03:36.565 --> 05:03:37.899
SO THAT THE WHOLE COMPLEX

05:03:37.966 --> 05:03:39.501
SITUATION LIKE OURS IS

05:03:39.568 --> 05:03:40.869

THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

05:03:53.248 --> 05:03:54.783
COMMUNICATE NOT JUST BY PEOPLE

05:03:54.849 --> 05:03:56.384

EXPLAIN OUR SITUATION AS WELL

05:04:31.686 --> 05:04:33.688

05:05:35.383 --> 05:05:37.285
MISTER BONTA OR SOMEBODY ELSE I

05:05:37.352 --> 05:05:38.520
DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

05:05:38.586 --> 05:05:43.358
SOMEBODY -- MISS BURKE

05:05:43.425 --> 05:05:43.658
[inaudible]

05:05:43.725 --> 05:05:46.494
OKAY -- SO I I TO AS SOMEBODY

05:05:46.561 --> 05:05:48.930
WHO IS WAS NOT A SUPPORTER OF

05:05:48.997 --> 05:05:49.798
TWO SEVEN SEVEN I WANT TO SAY

05:05:49.864 --> 05:05:52.033
THAT -- IT IS THIS IS AN

05:05:52.100 --> 05:05:53.768
EMOTIONAL TOPIC AND SO I DO

05:05:53.835 --> 05:05:55.870
UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE AROUND US

05:05:55.937 --> 05:05:58.573
HAVE BEEN A MOTIONAL HOWEVER TO

05:05:58.640 --> 05:05:59.674
REITERATE.

05:05:59.741 --> 05:06:02.043
THE FACT THAT THAT THE NEGATIVE

05:06:02.110 --> 05:06:03.845
PERSONAL DIRECTS ARE

05:06:03.912 --> 05:06:06.014
INAPPROPRIATE NINE I DO KNOW YOU

05:06:06.081 --> 05:06:07.782
TO BE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN

05:06:07.849 --> 05:06:09.284
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALTHOUGH

05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:10.952
WE DIFFERENTIATE ON WHAT THAT

05:06:11.019 --> 05:06:12.253
LOOKS LIKE.

05:06:12.320 --> 05:06:13.988
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE -- FOR

05:06:14.055 --> 05:06:15.757
AND I'M HOPING THAT IN THIS

05:06:15.824 --> 05:06:17.292
CONVERSATION WERE ABLE TO

05:06:17.358 --> 05:06:18.560
EXPRESS OF DIVERSITY OF

05:06:18.626 --> 05:06:21.196
PERSPECTIVES THAT WILL GET YOU

05:06:21.262 --> 05:06:22.397
TO A PLACE WHERE.

05:06:22.464 --> 05:06:23.431
WHERE ARE YOU WILL HAVE A BILL

05:06:23.498 --> 05:06:25.867
THAT THAT REALLY REPRESENTS ALL

05:06:25.934 --> 05:06:30.739
OF US IN THIS ROOM I DON'T KNOW

05:06:30.805 --> 05:06:31.606
BUT I'M I AM HOPEFUL?

05:06:31.673 --> 05:06:32.674
WITH THAT I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

05:06:32.741 --> 05:06:33.608
AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE

05:06:33.675 --> 05:06:34.676
HONESTLY JUST THEIR THEIR

05:06:34.743 --> 05:06:38.379
EDUCATION QUESTIONS FOR MYSELF --

05:06:38.446 --> 05:06:39.681
SO IN THIS SITUATION I THINK

05:06:39.748 --> 05:06:41.282
THIS WOMAN HAD OF A VERY GOOD

05:06:41.349 --> 05:06:42.584
POINT WHERE WHERE SOME THINGS

05:06:42.650 --> 05:06:44.753
ARE JUST MORE COMPLICATED THAN

05:06:44.819 --> 05:06:47.188
OTHERS -- AND I AM CURIOUS --

05:06:47.255 --> 05:06:48.556
AND THE CONCERT MY ONE OF MY

05:06:48.623 --> 05:06:49.824
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THIS KIND AND

05:06:49.891 --> 05:06:53.161
NEEDS MEDICAL EXCEPTION RIGHT.

05:06:53.228 --> 05:06:54.796
AS IN THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE YOU

05:06:54.863 --> 05:06:56.464
SAID FOR EXAMPLE A PRO LONG

05:06:56.531 --> 05:06:58.032
SEIZURES WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF

05:06:58.099 --> 05:06:59.467
ADMINISTRATION OF A VACCINE

05:06:59.534 --> 05:07:00.935
RIGHT SO LET'S SAY MY DAUGHTER

05:07:01.002 --> 05:07:01.736
HAS.

05:07:01.803 --> 05:07:02.971
WHICH I'VE SEEN IN PAPERS WHERE

05:07:03.037 --> 05:07:04.105
THEY SAY MY DAUGHTER HAD A

05:07:04.172 --> 05:07:05.073
SEIZURE MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T HAVE

05:07:05.140 --> 05:07:06.775
A SEIZURE OF MY DAUGHTER HAD TO

05:07:06.841 --> 05:07:08.009
ME WHAT I FELT WAS A STRONG

05:07:08.076 --> 05:07:10.845
REACTION. TO A VACCINE AND THEN

05:07:10.912 --> 05:07:13.815
I OPTED FOR A PRO LONG SCHEDULE

05:07:13.882 --> 05:07:15.450
MY DAUGHTER HAD HER BACKSEAT HAS

05:07:15.517 --> 05:07:17.285
HAD HER VACCINATIONS BUT OVER A

05:07:17.352 --> 05:07:18.353
SCHEDULE THAT I WAS COMFORTABLE

05:07:18.419 --> 05:07:19.821
WITH IT BECAUSE I WANTED HER TO

05:07:19.888 --> 05:07:22.657
BE SAFE AND I WANT TO

05:07:22.724 --> 05:07:22.957
COMMUNITIES.

05:07:23.024 --> 05:07:25.026
SO BUT LET'S SEE ONE DOES ONE

05:07:25.093 --> 05:07:26.394
CHILD DOES HAVE A SEIZURE AND BE

05:07:26.461 --> 05:07:27.328
CLEAR AS A MOTHER MY DAUGHTER

05:07:27.395 --> 05:07:29.664
HAS ONE SEIZURE THERE'S NOTHING

05:07:29.731 --> 05:07:32.534
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME.

05:07:32.600 --> 05:07:33.935
YOU PUT ME IN JAIL.

05:07:34.002 --> 05:07:34.769
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY TO

05:07:34.836 --> 05:07:35.870
ME THAT IS NOT GOING TO TRY TO

05:07:35.937 --> 05:07:37.305
LOOK VERY VERY CAREFULLY AND

05:07:37.372 --> 05:07:38.306
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITHIN

05:07:38.373 --> 05:07:40.308
THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR FORTY

05:07:40.375 --> 05:07:41.476
EIGHT HOURS OR WHATEVER IT WAS

05:07:41.543 --> 05:07:42.277
THAT CHANGED.

05:07:42.343 --> 05:07:43.945
RIGHT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND.

05:07:44.012 --> 05:07:45.713
HOWEVER MY CONCERN LIKE A GET

05:07:45.780 --> 05:07:47.749
WITH NEEDS MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND

05:07:47.816 --> 05:07:49.017
MY QUESTION IS.

05:07:49.083 --> 05:07:53.054
IS IT SAYS PROLONGS FEATURES.

05:07:53.121 --> 05:07:54.956
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER HAS ONE

05:07:55.023 --> 05:07:56.024
SEIZURE FROM A VACCINE.

05:07:56.090 --> 05:07:58.326
WHY DOES NOT NOT QUALIFY AS A

05:07:58.393 --> 05:08:00.461
REASON FOR ME NOW TO BE ABLE TO

05:08:00.528 --> 05:08:02.363
INVESTIGATE AND THEN MY OTHER

05:08:02.430 --> 05:08:02.864
QUESTION IS?

05:08:02.931 --> 05:08:04.532
IS THAT INVESTIGATION ONLY ON

05:08:04.599 --> 05:08:06.267
THAT.

05:08:06.334 --> 05:08:07.402
ONE VACCINE OR IS IT ON THE

05:08:07.468 --> 05:08:10.638
WHOLE COURSE IS IT.

05:08:10.705 --> 05:08:11.172
ON THE WHOLE COURSE OF AXE

05:08:11.239 --> 05:08:13.308
SCENES.

05:08:13.374 --> 05:08:14.409
OKAY IT'S A YES YES SO SO FIRST

05:08:14.475 --> 05:08:18.313
OF ALL -- IN REGARDS -- TO THE

05:08:18.379 --> 05:08:19.881
SEIZURES I I WOULD SAY IS THAT

05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:22.083
WHAT WE WANTED TO IS IS THAT --

05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:23.818
YOU KNOW WE WE BASE OUR MEDICAL

05:08:23.885 --> 05:08:27.322
DECISIONS AGAIN ON SCIENCE AND

05:08:27.388 --> 05:08:29.524
THE EVIDENCE -- AS I MENTIONED

05:08:29.591 --> 05:08:31.059
EARLIER IS THAT THERE ARE THINGS

05:08:31.125 --> 05:08:32.594
WE KNOW AND THEN THERE'S THINGS

05:08:32.660 --> 05:08:34.863
WE DON'T KNOW ALL RIGHT SO WE

05:08:34.929 --> 05:08:37.465
KNOW THAT BACK OUT YEAH OF AXES

05:08:37.532 --> 05:08:39.067
ON CAUSE AUTISM.

05:08:39.133 --> 05:08:40.602
THAT'S SETTLED YEAH THAT'S BEEN

05:08:40.668 --> 05:08:43.271
STUDIED -- OVER AND OVER AGAIN

05:08:43.338 --> 05:08:45.540
RIGHT -- LET ME SHOULD I SHARE

05:08:45.607 --> 05:08:46.341
WITH YOU.

05:08:46.407 --> 05:08:48.543
PERHAPS THERE'S ACTUALLY A STORY

05:08:48.610 --> 05:08:49.377
DOES A STORY WRITTEN IN THE

05:08:49.444 --> 05:08:50.011
WASHINGTON POST AND I SHOULD GET

05:08:50.078 --> 05:08:51.646
THAT TO YOU -- SO WHAT HAPPENED

05:08:51.713 --> 05:08:53.715
IS IS THAT -- WHEN THEY CAME

05:08:53.781 --> 05:08:54.616
FIRST CAME OUT WITH THAT THAT

05:08:54.682 --> 05:08:56.351
FEAR TETANUS FOR TOSSES VACCINE

05:08:56.417 --> 05:08:57.151
OKAY?

05:08:57.218 --> 05:08:58.486
THERE'S CAME OUT THEY DID NOTE

05:08:58.553 --> 05:09:00.221
THAT THERE IS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER

05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:03.057
RATE OF SEIZURES AND A FEVER AND

05:09:03.124 --> 05:09:04.392
SEIZURES ASSOCIATED WITH.

05:09:04.459 --> 05:09:05.627
OUR CHILDREN WHO GOT THAT

05:09:05.693 --> 05:09:08.696
VACCINE RIGHT AND SO IN FACT IT

05:09:08.763 --> 05:09:09.597
WAS.

05:09:09.664 --> 05:09:11.532
IN THE CONSERVATION PRECAUTIONS

05:09:11.599 --> 05:09:12.600
IT SAYS WELL IF YOU HAVE A

05:09:12.667 --> 05:09:16.004
SEIZURE -- WE DON'T GIVE ANYMORE

05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:17.038
AND I REMEMBER AS A TRAINING

05:09:17.105 --> 05:09:18.606
DEATHS -- WE SAID LIKE OKAY WELL

05:09:18.673 --> 05:09:19.941
THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF SEIZURES

05:09:20.008 --> 05:09:23.278
DON'T GIVE THAT THE TAP BACKS AT

05:09:23.344 --> 05:09:34.255
THE EDGE OF DENNIS D. T. P. IS

05:09:34.322 --> 05:09:36.124
BEFORE THE FIRE WITH YOURSELF.

05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:37.392
AND FOR THE PEOPLE ALSO WANT

05:09:37.458 --> 05:09:38.559
INVESTIGATED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T

05:09:38.626 --> 05:09:40.295
KNOW THEY COULD THEY DIDN'T KNOW

05:09:40.361 --> 05:09:41.863
THAT THEY SAID WELL THIS IS IT

05:09:41.930 --> 05:09:42.430
THIS VACCINE OURS ARE NOT.

05:09:42.497 --> 05:09:43.064
AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY DID STUDIES

05:09:43.131 --> 05:09:43.698
AND ACTUALLY WHAT THEY FOUND OUT

05:09:43.765 --> 05:09:44.666
THAT A LOT OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY

05:09:44.732 --> 05:09:46.401
DUE TO A GENETIC CONDITION.

05:09:46.467 --> 05:09:48.002
CALLED SURVEYS SYNDROME.

05:09:48.069 --> 05:09:49.404
SURVEYS SYNDROME IS A GENETIC

05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:49.971
CONDITION WHERE CHILD WILL

05:09:50.038 --> 05:09:50.538
DEVELOP SEIZURES AND SOME

05:09:50.605 --> 05:09:52.941
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY -- AND AND

05:09:53.007 --> 05:09:53.841
THEN IN A FAT AND OF COURSE IT

05:09:53.908 --> 05:09:54.876
AND IT'S TRIGGERED THE FIRST

05:09:54.943 --> 05:09:56.244
SYMPTOMS ARE TRIGGERED YOU BUY

05:09:56.311 --> 05:09:57.345
SOME INFLAMMATORY EVENTS SO

05:09:57.412 --> 05:09:58.413
COULD BE GETTING A VACCINE IT

05:09:58.479 --> 05:09:58.680
COULD BE.

05:09:58.746 --> 05:10:00.648
A COLD BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE BY

05:10:00.715 --> 05:10:02.317
SO IN FACT THE THEY INVESTIGATE

05:10:02.383 --> 05:10:03.584
AND THEY FOUND THAT.

05:10:03.651 --> 05:10:04.619
CHILDREN WHO -- WHETHER THEY'RE

05:10:04.686 --> 05:10:06.487
VACCINE OR NOT HAD THE SAME RATE

05:10:06.554 --> 05:10:08.890
OF SEIZURES AND OTHER SYMPTOMS

05:10:08.957 --> 05:10:10.758
RELATED TO THIS AND OKAY I THINK

05:10:10.825 --> 05:10:11.993
BUT LET'S GO BROADER THAN THAT

05:10:12.060 --> 05:10:12.560
OKAY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S I

05:10:12.627 --> 05:10:13.461
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING I GET

05:10:13.528 --> 05:10:14.963
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE BUT

05:10:15.029 --> 05:10:16.164
LET'S SEE THERE IS IT LET'S SEE.

05:10:16.230 --> 05:10:17.165
MY TARGETS A HUNDRED AND FOUR

05:10:17.231 --> 05:10:19.434
FEVER OKAY AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S

05:10:19.500 --> 05:10:20.969
NOT PROLONG BUT IT'S DANGEROUS

05:10:21.035 --> 05:10:22.737
ARE IS THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT

05:10:22.804 --> 05:10:23.972
A DOCTOR SO AND A HUNDRED FOR

05:10:24.038 --> 05:10:24.505
FEVERS QUALIFIES TO ME IS

05:10:24.572 --> 05:10:26.507
DANGEROUS EMERGENCY ROOM TIME

05:10:26.574 --> 05:10:28.810
RIGHT -- NO NOT NECESSARILY BUT

05:10:28.876 --> 05:10:30.244
LET ME JUST GET SOMETHING THAT

05:10:30.311 --> 05:10:31.980
HAPPENS THAT WE'LL SEE TO ME I

05:10:32.046 --> 05:10:33.514
FELT LIKE A FEVER WAS AND FOR ME

05:10:33.581 --> 05:10:35.416
TO RECONSIDER TO CONSIDER HOW TO

05:10:35.483 --> 05:10:37.552
DEAL WITH MY BUT MY QUESTION IS

05:10:37.618 --> 05:10:38.820
IS SOMETHING A SITUATION HAPPENS

05:10:38.886 --> 05:10:39.921
THAT IS DIRE ENOUGH THAT.

05:10:39.988 --> 05:10:47.895
MY DAUGHTER NEEDS TO GO TO AN

05:10:47.962 --> 05:10:49.664
EMERGENCY ROOM.

05:10:49.731 --> 05:10:50.598
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY TEMPERS UP

05:10:50.665 --> 05:10:51.799
SEVEN DAYS WHATEVER THAT

05:10:51.866 --> 05:10:53.234
SITUATION IN.

05:10:53.301 --> 05:10:54.035
WHAT WE IT WHY DOESN'T THAT

05:10:54.102 --> 05:10:55.236
QUALIFY FOR SOME A REASON FOR ME

05:10:55.303 --> 05:10:55.870
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

05:10:55.937 --> 05:10:56.471
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO REVIEW

05:10:56.537 --> 05:10:57.105
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN

05:10:57.171 --> 05:10:58.072
WHY DO I NEED TO BE CONCERNED

05:10:58.139 --> 05:10:58.639
THAT AS IT GOES THROUGH THE

05:10:58.706 --> 05:11:00.108
APPEALS PROCESS THAT SOMEBODY

05:11:00.174 --> 05:11:01.609
ELSE MIGHT DECIDE?

05:11:01.676 --> 05:11:02.343
THAT THEN MY DAUGHTER STILL

05:11:02.410 --> 05:11:04.679
NEEDS TO HAVE THE BACKSEAT

05:11:04.746 --> 05:11:06.280
VACCINATIONS SHE COULD I ORDER

05:11:06.347 --> 05:11:07.882
TO RED WINE I HAVE A GLASS OF

05:11:07.949 --> 05:11:12.220
RED WINE I DIDN'T KNOW IT.

05:11:12.286 --> 05:11:14.122
I KNOW IT'S A TOTAL BUMMER -- A

05:11:14.188 --> 05:11:16.424
SINGLE MOM OF A FOUR YEAR OLD HE

05:11:16.491 --> 05:11:20.328
BEING ALLERGIC TO READ ONE SUCKS --

05:11:20.395 --> 05:11:20.928
BUT JUST DOESN'T CUT IT RIGHT

05:11:20.995 --> 05:11:23.498
YEAH -- BUT I DRINK WAY RUN

05:11:23.564 --> 05:11:25.099
FOREVER I WAS ALLERGIC TO IT ONE

05:11:25.166 --> 05:11:27.635
DAY HAD A GLASS OF RED WINE MY

05:11:27.702 --> 05:11:28.202
THROAT CLOSE AND I WAS IN AN

05:11:28.269 --> 05:11:29.037
AMBULANCE.

05:11:29.103 --> 05:11:30.538
I WAS SCARED.

05:11:30.605 --> 05:11:31.506
WHAT IS THIS THING I MEAN IF

05:11:31.572 --> 05:11:32.140
SITUATIONS LIKE THAT OCCUR I'M

05:11:32.206 --> 05:11:33.107
NOT SURE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

05:11:33.174 --> 05:11:35.176
THAT DOESN'T QUALIFY I DON'T

05:11:35.243 --> 05:11:35.843
WANT TO JUST TO QUALIFY FOR THAT?

05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:36.911
ONE VACCINE I THEN SHOULD HAVE

05:11:36.978 --> 05:11:38.046
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THEM

05:11:38.112 --> 05:11:39.247
ALL OKAY SO SO I WOULD SAY IS

05:11:39.313 --> 05:11:42.316
FIRST OF ALL AGAIN THIS GOES

05:11:42.383 --> 05:11:44.152
BACK TO WHAT.

05:11:44.218 --> 05:11:45.386
YEAH IS IT.

05:11:45.453 --> 05:11:47.288
IS IT EVEN IS IT LIEU POSSIBLE

05:11:47.355 --> 05:11:48.022
THAT'S CAUSED BY THE VACCINE

05:11:48.089 --> 05:11:48.656
RIGHT AND IS IT JUST THINGS WE

05:11:48.723 --> 05:11:49.424
KNOW THERE'S THINGS WE DON'T

05:11:49.490 --> 05:11:51.059
KNOW SO ACTUALLY IF I CAN JUST

05:11:51.125 --> 05:11:52.593
REFER YOU SAID IGH FEVER WE

05:11:52.660 --> 05:11:53.895
THERE'S A CONDITION WE KNOW THAT.

05:11:53.961 --> 05:11:54.962
CHILDREN CAN DEVELOP WHAT'S

05:11:55.029 --> 05:11:57.298
CALLED FEBRILE SEIZURES RIGHT --

05:11:57.365 --> 05:11:58.733
AND THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY CAUSED

05:11:58.800 --> 05:11:59.434
BY RAPID RISE IN YOUR

05:11:59.500 --> 05:12:00.968
TEMPERATURE RIGHT AND THEY CAN

05:12:01.035 --> 05:12:02.837
HAVE A SEIZURE WE ALSO KNOW BY

05:12:02.904 --> 05:12:03.938
THE WAY THAT CHILDREN HAVE

05:12:04.005 --> 05:12:05.440
FEBRILE SEIZURES.

05:12:05.506 --> 05:12:07.208
ACTUALLY GROW OUT OF THEM AND

05:12:07.275 --> 05:12:08.509
THERE'S NO LONG TERM

05:12:08.576 --> 05:12:09.911
NEUROLOGICAL SEQUELAE ALRIGHT

05:12:09.977 --> 05:12:10.978
AND IT'S NOT DIRECTLY SO TO A

05:12:11.045 --> 05:12:12.547
VACCINES ALTHOUGH SOME VACCINES

05:12:12.613 --> 05:12:14.348
CAN CAUSE FEVER AND THEIR FIRST

05:12:14.415 --> 05:12:15.149
CAN.

05:12:15.216 --> 05:12:15.850
THAT THIS CAN HAVE TRACKED

05:12:15.917 --> 05:12:17.085
TRIGGER RIGHT ACTION BUT THAT

05:12:17.151 --> 05:12:18.086
WOULD NOT.

05:12:18.152 --> 05:12:20.088
THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS

05:12:20.154 --> 05:12:21.823
CONDITION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

05:12:21.889 --> 05:12:22.857
THIS CONDITION YOU KNOW THIS

05:12:22.924 --> 05:12:24.258
CONDITION IS NOT A CAUSED BY THE

05:12:24.325 --> 05:12:25.793
VACCINE INTO IS NOT.

05:12:25.860 --> 05:12:28.729
DOES NOT LEAD -- TO LONG TERM

05:12:28.796 --> 05:12:32.366
HARM -- THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE A

05:12:32.433 --> 05:12:34.502
PERMANENT CONTRA ELLA A PERMIT

05:12:34.569 --> 05:12:35.770
REASON NOT TO GET YOUR CHILD

05:12:35.837 --> 05:12:37.872
VACCINATED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

05:12:37.939 --> 05:12:40.274
THAT'S NOW IF YOU HAVE FOR

05:12:40.341 --> 05:12:41.109
EXAMPLE SO.

05:12:41.175 --> 05:12:42.176
IF IF THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE

05:12:42.243 --> 05:12:45.213
RIGHT I MEAN.

05:12:45.279 --> 05:12:45.847
RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING

05:12:45.913 --> 05:12:46.047
THAT.

05:12:46.114 --> 05:12:47.815
HOUSING AND IF YOU'RE THE

05:12:47.882 --> 05:12:49.584
EXCEPTION RIGHT WELL AT THE END

05:12:49.650 --> 05:12:50.551
NOT THE RULE AND WHICH IS WHAT

05:12:50.618 --> 05:12:51.519
THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION IS

05:12:51.586 --> 05:12:52.420
ABOUT RIGHT.

05:12:52.487 --> 05:12:54.288
IT'S NOT FOR THE PLETHORA PEOPLE

05:12:54.355 --> 05:12:55.623
WHO CAN GET A VACCINE WHO GET

05:12:55.690 --> 05:12:56.824
THEM EVERY DAY WHO ARE FINE AND

05:12:56.891 --> 05:12:58.693
THERE'S NOT AN ISSUE IT'S ABOUT

05:12:58.759 --> 05:13:00.194
THOSE OF US WHO MAYBE HAVE.

05:13:00.261 --> 05:13:02.096
THAT FALL INTO THE CRACKS AND

05:13:02.163 --> 05:13:03.231
THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

05:13:03.297 --> 05:13:04.398
UNDERSTAND THAT A BILL THAT'S

05:13:04.465 --> 05:13:06.033
GOING TO AFFECT EVERY CHILD IN

05:13:06.100 --> 05:13:07.802
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT

05:13:07.869 --> 05:13:09.137
IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THOSE

05:13:09.203 --> 05:13:10.605
EXCEPTIONS.

05:13:10.671 --> 05:13:13.141
THAT'S WHAT I THINK THE MY

05:13:13.207 --> 05:13:15.877
CONCERN IS SO I I I LET YOU

05:13:15.943 --> 05:13:17.278
FINISH AND THEN ON THE

05:13:17.345 --> 05:13:18.980
OPPOSITION FINISH HOWEVER I'M

05:13:19.046 --> 05:13:20.047
GOING TO SEE A DOCTOR I WOULD

05:13:20.114 --> 05:13:21.949
PREFER SOMEONE ELSE ANSWER THIS

05:13:22.016 --> 05:13:22.750
QUESTION OKAY SO LET ME JUST

05:13:22.817 --> 05:13:23.317
FINISH INTO YOUR QUESTION I

05:13:23.384 --> 05:13:24.218
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION SO WHAT.

05:13:24.285 --> 05:13:25.786
WE WANNA DO IS BECAUSE AS I SAID

05:13:25.853 --> 05:13:28.890
BEFORE EVERY MEDICAL EXEMPTION --

05:13:28.956 --> 05:13:30.625
OF COURSE WEAKENS THE COMMUNITY

05:13:30.691 --> 05:13:32.660
OF THE SCHOOL RIGHT BUT WE WON'T

05:13:32.727 --> 05:13:33.628
BE SURE EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS

05:13:33.694 --> 05:13:34.629
MEDICAL THAT SHE GETS.

05:13:34.695 --> 05:13:44.138
ONE AND IN FACT AS I MENTIONED

05:13:44.205 --> 05:13:45.840
EARLIER -- WE WANT TO ACTUALLY

05:13:45.907 --> 05:13:47.775
LEAN IN FAVOR OF WE DON'T KNOW

05:13:47.842 --> 05:13:48.543
RIGHT IS IT'S IN THE SPACE OF WE

05:13:48.609 --> 05:13:49.544
DON'T KNOW IT MIGHT BE THE

05:13:49.610 --> 05:13:50.411
VACCINE THAT MIGHT NOT.

05:13:50.478 --> 05:13:51.679
THEN WILL WE WANNA LEAN IN FAVOR

05:13:51.746 --> 05:13:52.847
OF THE CHILD NOT AS SAYING THAT

05:13:52.914 --> 05:13:54.081
WELLOKAY WE'LL GIVE YOU THE

05:13:54.148 --> 05:13:55.149
EXEMPTION BILLS WE KNOW FOR IF

05:13:55.216 --> 05:13:56.217
IF WE LIKE NOW WE RECOGNIZE THIS

05:13:56.284 --> 05:13:58.553
CONDITION IT'S NOT SO TO THE

05:13:58.619 --> 05:13:59.720
VACCINE.

05:13:59.787 --> 05:14:00.888
THEN I'D I THINK WE OWE IT TO

05:14:00.955 --> 05:14:02.223
THE US THE REST OF THE CHILDREN

05:14:02.290 --> 05:14:02.957
INCLUDING THE ONES WHO REALLY

05:14:03.024 --> 05:14:03.558
NEED THE EXEMPTION.

05:14:03.624 --> 05:14:04.058
THAT WE'RE NOT GRANTING

05:14:04.125 --> 05:14:04.692
EXEMPTION FOR THOSE CONDITIONS

05:14:04.759 --> 05:14:05.760
AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHERE THE

05:14:05.826 --> 05:14:07.028
MEDICAL THAT'S WHERE THE WE LOOK

05:14:07.094 --> 05:14:09.297
AT THE EVIDENCE AND THAT'S THE

05:14:09.363 --> 05:14:10.898
THE JUDGMENT SO WE DON'T KNOW.

05:14:10.965 --> 05:14:12.233
WE WANT TO GIVE THE LATITUDE

05:14:12.300 --> 05:14:13.034
THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE

05:14:13.100 --> 05:14:14.535
THE BALANCE WITH APPEAL PANEL SO

05:14:14.602 --> 05:14:16.671
FORTH -- WE DON'T CREATE A

05:14:16.737 --> 05:14:18.139
LOOPHOLE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY

05:14:18.206 --> 05:14:20.174
THAT'S THERE ARE.

05:14:20.241 --> 05:14:21.209
THAT HIS GROUP A HANDFUL IT'S

05:14:21.275 --> 05:14:22.043
GOOD POSITIONS WILL TAKE A

05:14:22.109 --> 05:14:23.978
LITTLE LOOPHOLE AND TURN IT INTO

05:14:24.045 --> 05:14:24.745
A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

05:14:24.812 --> 05:14:26.581
UNFORTUNATELY AND ENDANGER

05:14:26.647 --> 05:14:27.748
CHILDREN THE PROCESS AND THAT WE

05:14:27.815 --> 05:14:29.016
WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP

05:14:29.083 --> 05:14:31.452
THAT FROM HAPPENING.

05:14:31.519 --> 05:14:32.053
YOU KNOW AND I ACTUALLY DON'T

05:14:32.119 --> 05:14:32.853
EITHER.

05:14:32.920 --> 05:14:37.258
AS I JUST HAVE TWO MORE

05:14:37.325 --> 05:14:38.526
QUESTIONS -- I GUESS MY OTHER

05:14:38.593 --> 05:14:39.727
QUESTION IS IS WE HAVE ONE

MIGHT BE A LITTLE HEAVY HANDED A

05:16:16.824 --> 05:16:18.993
LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S A QUESTION

05:16:19.060 --> 05:16:21.095
PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER LEADER

05:16:21.162 --> 05:16:23.397
CONVERSATION I KNOW WE'RE NOT

05:16:23.464 --> 05:16:25.900

THOSE SUPER A MOTIONAL.

05:16:39.313 --> 05:16:42.350
CONVERSATIONS AND WELL ACTUALLY

05:16:42.416 --> 05:16:43.651

05:16:43.718 --> 05:16:45.553
SOMEONE HAS A FAMILY IF THE

05:16:45.619 --> 05:16:47.455
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY IS PART

05:16:47.521 --> 05:16:49.056
OF THE CONVERSATION.

05:16:49.123 --> 05:16:51.025
WHAT CAN YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE

05:16:51.092 --> 05:16:52.159
OF A TIME?

05:16:52.226 --> 05:16:53.260
WHEN?

05:16:53.327 --> 05:16:54.795
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY WOULD

05:16:54.862 --> 05:16:56.097
ALLOW ME A MEDICAL EXEMPTION

05:16:56.163 --> 05:16:57.565
THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE MY CHILD

05:16:57.631 --> 05:16:59.800
TO GET A VACCINATION ON AT THE

05:16:59.867 --> 05:17:01.302
ON SET.

05:17:01.369 --> 05:17:04.071
SO FOR EXAMPLE AT AT ACTUALLY IN

05:17:04.138 --> 05:17:05.306
THE CDC GUIDELINES THEMSELVES IF

05:17:05.373 --> 05:17:06.841
YOUR CHILD HAS A FIRST DEGREE

05:17:06.907 --> 05:17:08.109
RELATIVE WHO HAS A CONGENITAL

05:17:08.175 --> 05:17:11.045
HEREDITARY IMMUNO DEFICIENCY --

05:17:11.112 --> 05:17:12.580
YOU AUTOMATICALLY YOU GET A

05:17:12.646 --> 05:17:14.749
MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR THE MMR

05:17:14.815 --> 05:17:16.984

TO WELL THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE

05:17:18.052 --> 05:17:18.953
THERE'S A RISK BECAUSE THEY'RE

05:17:19.019 --> 05:17:20.788
LIVE VIRUS VACCINES I ALSO IF I

05:17:20.855 --> 05:17:23.791
NEED TO SAY IS IS THAT -- AND

05:17:23.858 --> 05:17:25.493
BLANK.

05:17:25.559 --> 05:17:26.861
RIGHT THINKING YOUR NAME AGAIN.

05:17:26.927 --> 05:17:28.028
EIGHTY LAZY SCOTT YEAH I THINK

05:17:28.095 --> 05:17:29.230
IF YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED BY AN

05:17:29.296 --> 05:17:31.599
IMMUNOLOGIST YOU'LL BE FOLLOWED

05:17:31.665 --> 05:17:32.933
BY IN YOUR LAWS SEE OF A COMPLEX.

05:17:33.000 --> 05:17:36.237
SITUATION -- THAT AGAIN.

05:17:36.303 --> 05:17:37.338
YEAH I CAN'T PREDICT INTO THE

05:17:37.405 --> 05:17:39.073
FUTURE BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF

05:17:39.140 --> 05:17:40.441
SITUATION I WOULD.

05:17:40.508 --> 05:17:42.143
THINK THAT KNOWING MY COLLEAGUES

05:17:42.209 --> 05:17:44.278
WOULD BE THAT IF I WAS ON A PEER

05:17:44.345 --> 05:17:45.946
REVIEW PANEL IT'S A WORLD THIS

05:17:46.013 --> 05:17:48.149
THIS SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THIS

05:17:48.215 --> 05:17:49.517
LOOKS REAL RIGHT THIS THERE

05:17:49.583 --> 05:17:51.585
FOLLOWED BY IMMUNOLOGIST.

05:17:51.652 --> 05:17:53.354
THAT PERSON IS SOMEONE WHO'S

05:17:53.421 --> 05:17:56.490
YEAH AND AND AND I MEAN IT'S

05:17:56.557 --> 05:17:57.691
CLEARLY IMMUNE SUPPRESSION --

05:17:57.758 --> 05:17:59.260
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS INVOLVED.

05:17:59.326 --> 05:18:00.060
THAT'S THE SPACE WHERE IT'S LIKE

05:18:00.127 --> 05:18:01.228
YOU KNOW I WANT TO GIVE THEM THE

05:18:01.295 --> 05:18:02.930
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WE'RE NOT

05:18:02.997 --> 05:18:05.499
SAYING IT'S STRICTLY CZ BY THE

05:18:05.566 --> 05:18:06.801
WAY THIS THESE GUYS DO GIVE.

05:18:06.867 --> 05:18:07.401
YOU KNOW SAYING IF YOU'RE IN

05:18:07.468 --> 05:18:08.903
SUPPRESSED AND SO FORTH THEY DO

05:18:08.969 --> 05:18:10.271
ACTUALLY ALLOW YOU TO GET

05:18:10.337 --> 05:18:12.406
EXEMPTIONS FOR THOSE REASONS.

05:18:12.473 --> 05:18:13.541
SO I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN

05:18:13.607 --> 05:18:15.643
THAT MAYBE WE DON'T QUITE FIT IN

05:18:15.709 --> 05:18:16.310
THE BOX YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT DO

05:18:16.377 --> 05:18:17.478
YOU FIT IN THE BOX BUT THAT'S

05:18:17.545 --> 05:18:19.246
WHY WE ALSO PUT IN THE PROCESS

05:18:19.313 --> 05:18:20.881
BY THE WAY WE ALSO SEE THE C. P.

05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:22.049
H. CLINICIANS.

05:18:22.116 --> 05:18:24.118
CAN DO STANDARD OF CARE TO SO

05:18:24.185 --> 05:18:25.886
THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY TIED THE

05:18:25.953 --> 05:18:28.155
THINK THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE

05:18:28.222 --> 05:18:29.490
YOU GO YOU KNOW WHAT -- THERE

05:18:29.557 --> 05:18:31.392
FOLLOWED BY A SPECIALIST THEY

05:18:31.459 --> 05:18:32.560
CLEARLY HAVE YOU KNOW IT'S WELL

05:18:32.626 --> 05:18:35.062
DOCUMENTED THAT PERSON IS GOING

05:18:35.129 --> 05:18:36.096
TO IS LIKE OKAY LET'S GIVE THAT

05:18:36.163 --> 05:18:38.165
PERSON THAT EXEMPTION THE PERSON

05:18:38.232 --> 05:18:40.301
SAYS WELL I YEAH I I YEAH I HAD

05:18:40.367 --> 05:18:42.236
SOME SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY

05:18:42.303 --> 05:18:43.871
UNCLE AND I WANT TO MEDICAL

05:18:43.938 --> 05:18:46.207
EXEMPTION FOR MY KID.

05:18:46.273 --> 05:18:47.074
AND SOMEONE'S WRITING A LOT OF

05:18:47.141 --> 05:18:48.008
YOU KNOW SAYING THAT -- THERE'S

05:18:48.075 --> 05:18:49.009
A FAMILY HISTORY OF IMMUNE

05:18:49.076 --> 05:18:50.744
DEFICIENCY BUT THE CHILD AND

05:18:50.811 --> 05:19:01.155
THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION WITH AN

05:19:01.222 --> 05:19:03.157
EFFICIENCY IS A DISTANT RELATIVE.

05:19:03.224 --> 05:19:03.757
THAT GETS A LOOK I THINK THAT

05:19:03.824 --> 05:19:05.159
REQUIRES MORE INVESTIGATION AN

05:19:05.226 --> 05:19:06.861
INQUIRY INTO THAT WE CAN'T PROVE

05:19:06.927 --> 05:19:07.695
IT THEN THAT WOULD -- THAT'S

05:19:07.761 --> 05:19:09.029
FINE MORE OF AN EXCUSE THAN

05:19:09.096 --> 05:19:09.630
ANYTHING ELSE.

05:19:09.697 --> 05:19:10.664
SO IS ACTUALLY UNDER CARE BY A

05:19:10.731 --> 05:19:12.600
SPECIALIST IN IMMUNOLOGY -- FRY

05:19:12.666 --> 05:19:14.068
WOULD GET GET QUITE A BIT OF

05:19:14.134 --> 05:19:14.969
DIFFERENCE TO THAT SPECIALIST

05:19:15.035 --> 05:19:18.405
HOWEVER LACY IS STILL CONCERNED

05:19:18.472 --> 05:19:22.176
SO CAN I JUST HEAR FROM YOU

05:19:22.243 --> 05:19:22.476
[inaudible]

05:19:22.543 --> 05:19:24.345
APOLOGIZE.

05:19:24.411 --> 05:19:25.012
AND MAYBE THIS COULD CLEAR IT UP

05:19:25.079 --> 05:19:25.980
IF I EXPLAINED REALLY QUICK WHAT

05:19:26.046 --> 05:19:26.547
HAPPENED IN OUR SCENARIO AND

05:19:26.614 --> 05:19:27.548
THEN YOU CAN EVEN ANSWER HOW YOU

05:19:27.615 --> 05:19:28.816
WOULD SUGGEST IT WOULD BE

05:19:28.883 --> 05:19:30.451
TREATED SO -- BEFORE I FOUND OUT

05:19:30.518 --> 05:19:31.085
THAT I WAS IMMUNO COMPROMISED I

05:19:31.151 --> 05:19:33.387
WAS RECEIVING VACCINES AND I

05:19:33.454 --> 05:19:34.788
RECEIVED A T. DOT.

05:19:34.855 --> 05:19:36.257
D. TAP VACCINE AND HAD A VERY

05:19:36.323 --> 05:19:38.192
SEVERE SEVERE REACTION -- THAT

05:19:38.259 --> 05:19:41.629
INCLUDED VERTIGO FOR TWO AND A

05:19:41.695 --> 05:19:42.296
HALF WEEKS I COULDN'T GET OUT OF

05:19:42.363 --> 05:19:43.063
THAT.

05:19:43.130 --> 05:19:45.766
I HAD A HORRIBLE JOINT AND JOINT

05:19:45.833 --> 05:19:48.469
PAIN AND SWELLING WHERE THEY HAD

05:19:48.536 --> 05:19:49.837
TO CUT OFFERINGS.

05:19:49.904 --> 05:19:52.640
I HAD FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS --

05:19:52.706 --> 05:19:54.642
HORRIBLE STOMACH ACHES -- I HAD

05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:56.577
VISION DISRUPTIONS WHERE I WAS

05:19:56.644 --> 05:19:58.112
SEEING FLOATERS BESIDES THE

05:19:58.178 --> 05:19:58.812
VERTIGO.

05:19:58.879 --> 05:20:00.748
AND I LOST PARTIAL HEARING IN MY

05:20:00.814 --> 05:20:02.883
RIGHT EAR FOR UP TO TWO MONTHS

05:20:02.950 --> 05:20:04.618
IT LIKELY CAME BACK SO I CAN

05:20:04.685 --> 05:20:05.553
HEAR AGAIN.

05:20:05.619 --> 05:20:07.021
BUT THIS WAS A VERY EXTREME

05:20:07.087 --> 05:20:09.523
REACTION AND WHEN I WENT BACK TO

05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:11.458
MY DOCTOR I I ACTUALLY CALLED

05:20:11.525 --> 05:20:13.160
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GO BACK RIGHT

05:20:13.227 --> 05:20:13.794
AWAY BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET OUT

05:20:13.861 --> 05:20:14.728
OF BED.

05:20:14.795 --> 05:20:16.530
THEY TOLD ME THAT I MUST A

05:20:16.597 --> 05:20:17.765
CAUGHT A VIRUS.

05:20:17.831 --> 05:20:19.266
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS IMMUNE

05:20:19.333 --> 05:20:21.535
COMPROMISED AT THE TIME -- I

05:20:21.602 --> 05:20:23.170
STARTED VACCINATING MY CHILDREN

05:20:23.237 --> 05:20:25.239
THEY ENDED UP HAVING -- THEIR

05:20:25.306 --> 05:20:27.508
FIRST DE TAP AND DID NOT A HAVE

05:20:27.575 --> 05:20:29.443
A VACCINE REACTION IT WASN'T

05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:31.278
UNTIL THEIR SECOND DO YOU TAP

05:20:31.345 --> 05:20:34.615
THAT THEY HAD THE SAME EXACT

05:20:34.682 --> 05:20:36.150
VACCINE REACTION THAT I DID.

05:20:36.216 --> 05:20:37.718
I CALLED THEIR PEDIATRICIAN AND

05:20:37.785 --> 05:20:39.086
THEY TOLD ME THEY MUST OF CAUGHT

05:20:39.153 --> 05:20:41.221
A VIRUS.

05:20:41.288 --> 05:20:43.691
AND SO IT MADE ME AS A MOTHER

05:20:43.757 --> 05:20:45.559
REALIZE I NEED TO LOOK DEEPER

05:20:45.626 --> 05:20:48.495
INTO WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH OUR

05:20:48.562 --> 05:20:50.197
IMMUNOLOGY AND I I HAD ALREADY

05:20:50.264 --> 05:20:51.565
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE

05:20:51.632 --> 05:20:53.434
DISORDER SO I KNEW THAT THERE

05:20:53.500 --> 05:20:54.802
WAS SOMETHING OFF WITH MY BODY.

05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:56.837
SO THAT'S WHEN I FINALLY WAS

05:20:56.904 --> 05:20:58.606
REFERRED TO YOU SEE US OFF AND

05:20:58.672 --> 05:21:00.207
THEY DID THE MILLION DOLLAR WORK

05:21:00.274 --> 05:21:02.543
UP BECAUSE CV IDEAS AND

05:21:02.610 --> 05:21:04.044
DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS.

05:21:04.111 --> 05:21:05.913
ONLY ABOUT ONE IN SEVEN HUNDRED

05:21:05.980 --> 05:21:06.714
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

05:21:06.780 --> 05:21:10.884
CALIFORNIA HAVE WHAT I HAVE SO

05:21:10.951 --> 05:21:11.151
IT'S RARE.

05:21:11.218 --> 05:21:13.187
ETAN'S.

05:21:13.253 --> 05:21:13.921
LUCKILY WE DIDN'T IN THE

05:21:13.988 --> 05:21:15.055
MEANTIME VACCINATE THEM AGAIN WE

05:21:15.122 --> 05:21:16.490
HAD HELD OFF SO LIKE YOU SAID

05:21:16.557 --> 05:21:18.292
YOU YOU START LOOKING AT THIS

05:21:18.359 --> 05:21:20.294
AND AND WAITING AND HOLDING

05:21:20.361 --> 05:21:21.395
OFFICE OF PARENT.

05:21:21.462 --> 05:21:23.764
AND BUT WE WOULDN'T UNDER THIS

05:21:23.831 --> 05:21:25.866
LAW I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE WOULD

05:21:25.933 --> 05:21:28.502
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE TIME TO DO

05:21:28.569 --> 05:21:30.104
THAT THIS.

05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.904
OKAY SO THIS TOOK ME.

05:21:30.971 --> 05:21:32.973
OVER A YEAR AND A HALF TO BE

05:21:33.040 --> 05:21:35.376
DIAGNOSED WITH US SO THIS WAS

05:21:35.442 --> 05:21:37.811
THIS WAS A LONG SO I DON'T THINK

05:21:37.878 --> 05:21:38.512
THAT THE THIRTY DAYS WHAT OF

05:21:38.579 --> 05:21:41.248
APPLY TO ME AND I KNOW YOU'RE

05:21:41.315 --> 05:21:43.150
SAYING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BUT

05:21:43.217 --> 05:21:44.551
OKAY.

05:21:44.618 --> 05:21:45.085
WE CAN OKAY SO.

05:21:45.152 --> 05:21:46.020
IT SAYS SO THAT HAPPENED IN THE

05:21:46.086 --> 05:21:47.721
MEANTIME I WAS ALSO VACCINATED

05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:49.123
AGAIN AND HAD ANOTHER FAX THE

05:21:49.189 --> 05:21:51.425
REACTION YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE

05:21:51.492 --> 05:21:53.560
DIAGNOSED WITH C. B. ID BY KEVIN

05:21:53.627 --> 05:21:54.995
A VACCINE.

05:21:55.062 --> 05:21:57.131
AT PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE IN YOU

05:21:57.197 --> 05:21:58.565
HAVE YOUR TIGHTER COUNT TAKEN

05:21:58.632 --> 05:21:59.867
BEFORE.

05:21:59.933 --> 05:22:01.135
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T

05:22:01.201 --> 05:22:03.671
HAVE TITERS FOR PNEUMONIA IS

05:22:03.737 --> 05:22:05.172
WHAT THAT VACCINE IS FOR THEN

05:22:05.239 --> 05:22:06.507
YOU WERE GIVEN THE VACCINE THE

05:22:06.573 --> 05:22:08.108
PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE.

05:22:08.175 --> 05:22:09.977
AND THEN THEY TAKE THE TIGHTER

05:22:10.044 --> 05:22:12.546
COUNT AGAIN AFTER AND THEN THEY

05:22:12.613 --> 05:22:13.814
DID IT AGAIN BECAUSE I DIDN'T

05:22:13.881 --> 05:22:16.216
RESPOND AT ALL I HAD NO TIGHTER

05:22:16.283 --> 05:22:17.251
COUNTS SHOW UP.

05:22:17.317 --> 05:22:18.819
THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN TWO

05:22:18.886 --> 05:22:21.121
MONTHS AFTER STILL NO TIGHTER

05:22:21.188 --> 05:22:21.622
COUNT.

05:22:21.689 --> 05:22:24.425
AND SO AT THAT POINT I WAS

05:22:24.491 --> 05:22:25.459
DIAGNOSED WITH CV ID.

05:22:25.526 --> 05:22:27.428
AND WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS A

05:22:27.494 --> 05:22:28.796
VACCINE REACTION THAT MY

05:22:28.862 --> 05:22:33.500
CHILDREN HAD.

05:22:33.567 --> 05:22:35.335
AS WELL AS MYSELF.

05:22:35.402 --> 05:22:36.904
AT THAT POINT THEN.

05:22:36.970 --> 05:22:38.072
I HAD TO GO GET A VACCINE

05:22:38.138 --> 05:22:39.907
EXEMPTION WHICH YES IT WAS VERY

05:22:39.973 --> 05:22:41.341
EASY AT THAT POINT BUT I'M

05:22:41.408 --> 05:22:42.976
CONCERNED WITH THIS FIVE

05:22:43.043 --> 05:22:44.344
EXEMPTION RULE.

05:22:44.411 --> 05:22:46.313
IS WELL DOCTORS STICK THEIR NECK

05:22:46.380 --> 05:22:48.282
OUT ON THE LINE FOR PEOPLE LIKE

05:22:48.348 --> 05:22:50.184
ME THEY DON'T FIT INTO THAT

05:22:50.250 --> 05:22:52.553
CATEGORY SPECIFICALLY.

05:22:52.619 --> 05:22:53.220
YES.

05:22:53.287 --> 05:22:54.288
AND SENATOR PAN IT SAID WERE

05:22:54.354 --> 05:22:57.391
EXEMPT COMPLETELY FOR MM ARE AND

05:22:57.458 --> 05:22:59.226
FOR SALAS BEING.

05:22:59.293 --> 05:23:00.294
ODD BEING A MOVIE I'M YOU KNOW

05:23:00.360 --> 05:23:01.795
COMPROMISED THAT'S NO QUESTION

05:23:01.862 --> 05:23:03.130
BUT THE DETAIL BECAUSE IT

05:23:03.197 --> 05:23:04.765
DOESN'T FALL WITHIN THOSE

05:23:04.832 --> 05:23:07.067
GUIDELINES AND MY PEDIATRICIAN

05:23:07.134 --> 05:23:09.269
DIDN'T EVEN DOCUMENT THEIR CHART

05:23:09.336 --> 05:23:11.071
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A NORMAL

05:23:11.138 --> 05:23:17.077
VIRUS IS WHAT SHE HAD SAID.

05:23:17.144 --> 05:23:18.779
IT WORRIES ME BECAUSE OUR

05:23:18.846 --> 05:23:19.713
DOCUMENTATION.

05:23:19.780 --> 05:23:21.381
YOU KNOW I HAD TO ADD IT

05:23:21.448 --> 05:23:22.416
AFTERWARDS WHICH WHAT A SECOND

05:23:22.483 --> 05:23:24.451
LOOK MAKE ME LOOK LIKE ADDING TO

05:23:24.518 --> 05:23:26.120
MY CHILDREN'S CHART.

05:23:26.186 --> 05:23:30.124
AND THEN ALSO -- WHEN WHEN I

05:23:30.190 --> 05:23:31.692
COMPLAINED ABOUT MY VACCINE WHAT

05:23:31.759 --> 05:23:33.093
I WAS THINKING WAS A VACCINE

05:23:33.160 --> 05:23:34.661
REACTION TO MY DOCTOR AGAIN

05:23:34.728 --> 05:23:36.497
DIDN'T DIE YOU KNOW DIDN'T WRITE

05:23:36.563 --> 05:23:37.364
IT ON MY CHART IS A VACCINE

05:23:37.431 --> 05:23:39.666
EXAMPLE S. VACCINE REACTION AT

05:23:39.733 --> 05:23:40.934
THAT TIME EITHER?

05:23:41.001 --> 05:23:42.903
AND SO IT STARTS TO GET TURKEY

05:23:42.970 --> 05:23:45.973
AND THEN HEPATITIS B. SO WE HAVE

05:23:46.039 --> 05:23:47.374
WHAT IS CALLED SERUM SICKNESS

05:23:47.441 --> 05:23:49.443
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE REACTING SO

05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:50.844
YOU YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH SIR --

05:23:50.911 --> 05:23:52.446
SICKNESS.

05:23:52.513 --> 05:23:53.413
AND SO SIR I'M SICK YES I KNOW

05:23:53.480 --> 05:23:54.748
THIS GETS VERY COMPLEX AND I

05:23:54.815 --> 05:23:56.650
KNOW YOU ALL ARE NOT DOCTORS BUT

05:23:56.717 --> 05:23:57.818
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

05:23:57.885 --> 05:23:59.286
WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF.

05:23:59.353 --> 05:24:00.954
IS SIR -- SICKNESS THEY SAY THAT

05:24:01.021 --> 05:24:02.956
THE REASON WHY WE REACT THIS WAY

05:24:03.023 --> 05:24:05.192
IS BECAUSE IT'S A AND BOTH THE

05:24:05.259 --> 05:24:06.927
D. TAPI ON THE PNEUMOCOCCAL MADE

05:24:06.994 --> 05:24:08.428
ME REACT THIS WAY IS.

05:24:08.495 --> 05:24:10.531
MY ANTIBODIES GET TRAPPED INSIDE

05:24:10.597 --> 05:24:13.734
MY TISSUE JOINTS.

05:24:13.801 --> 05:24:15.135
IT COULD EVEN BE BRAIN AND MAKE

05:24:15.202 --> 05:24:16.403
YOUR BRAIN SWELL.

05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:18.338
AND SO MY ANTIBODIES WILL GET

05:24:18.405 --> 05:24:23.977
TRAPPED AND I FOR SOME REASON MY

05:24:24.044 --> 05:24:26.647
BODY DOESN'T GET RID OF THEM.

05:24:26.713 --> 05:24:27.514
AND THEY ARE GUESSING THAT

05:24:27.581 --> 05:24:28.382
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY

05:24:28.448 --> 05:24:29.316
CHILDREN TOO ALTHOUGH AGAIN IT'S

05:24:29.383 --> 05:24:30.517
VERY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE FIX

05:24:30.584 --> 05:24:32.786
CV ID AND AT ANY TIME YOU CAN

05:24:32.853 --> 05:24:34.421
DEVELOP CB ID SO IT'S NOT

05:24:34.488 --> 05:24:35.856
SOMETHING I WAS BORN WITH.

05:24:35.923 --> 05:24:38.091
YOU DEVELOP IT OVER TIME AND SO

05:24:38.158 --> 05:24:40.093
RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T THINK THAT

05:24:40.160 --> 05:24:41.728
THEY HAVE SEE THE ID AND THEY

05:24:41.795 --> 05:24:43.163
DON'T KNOW WHY.

05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:44.731
THEIR BODIES ARE REACTING TO

05:24:44.798 --> 05:24:47.100
VACCINES LIKE MINE SO I AGAIN

05:24:47.167 --> 05:24:49.336
HAVE THIS KIND OF SWISS CHEESE

05:24:49.403 --> 05:24:50.971
OF MEDICAL RECORDS NOT

05:24:51.038 --> 05:24:52.339
EXPLAINING IT AND SO THESE ARE

05:24:52.406 --> 05:24:53.941
THE TYPES OF SITUATIONS THAT

05:24:54.007 --> 05:24:55.876
WERE TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT AND

05:24:55.943 --> 05:24:56.910
JUST TO BE CLEAR WE ARE

05:24:56.977 --> 05:24:57.778
CONCERNED.

05:24:57.845 --> 05:24:59.413
ABOUT THE LIMIT OF FIVE IS THAT

05:24:59.479 --> 05:25:00.480
NO ONE LIKES TO BE CALLED TO THE

05:25:00.547 --> 05:25:02.149
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE RIGHT LIKE NO

05:25:02.216 --> 05:25:03.350
ONE WANTS TO BE NO ONE WANTS

05:25:03.417 --> 05:25:05.185
THEIR FIVE EXEMPTIONS AND THEN

05:25:05.252 --> 05:25:06.286
GET CALLED IN ALL OF THEIR STUFF

05:25:06.353 --> 05:25:07.554
IS REVIEWED AND THEN.

05:25:07.621 --> 05:25:09.189
ALL THE SUDDEN BY SUBJECTIVE

05:25:09.256 --> 05:25:11.358
WITH APPEAR OF THREE PEOPLE WHO

05:25:11.425 --> 05:25:13.260
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A DIFFERENT

05:25:13.327 --> 05:25:14.928
PERSPECTIVE -- WHO MAYBE MORE

05:25:14.995 --> 05:25:16.763
HEAVY HANDED OR LESS HAVING

05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:18.899
ENDED THAT MAKING A CHOICE ON

05:25:18.966 --> 05:25:20.767
THIS DOCTORS RIGHT AND THAT

05:25:20.834 --> 05:25:21.668
REALLY NEEDED A SIGN OR TO

05:25:21.735 --> 05:25:22.769
ANALYZE AND THEN IF YOURS DOES

05:25:22.836 --> 05:25:27.274

05:25:27.341 --> 05:25:31.078

05:25:31.979 --> 05:25:32.512
LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND SHE HAS

05:25:32.579 --> 05:25:33.413
IT SO I THINK IT SHOULD BE

05:25:33.480 --> 05:25:34.548
EXPRESS AND I I THINK THIS IS

05:25:34.615 --> 05:25:35.082
WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO SAY.

05:25:35.148 --> 05:25:36.884
IS THAT THE CONCERN IS IS THAT

05:25:36.950 --> 05:25:38.485
ONCE THERE IS THAT THRESHOLD.

05:25:38.552 --> 05:25:41.088
YOU HIT THAT THRESHOLD YOU GET

05:25:41.154 --> 05:25:42.055
CALLED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

05:25:42.122 --> 05:25:44.424
FIRST OF ALL DOES ANYONE EVER

PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE NO NO AND

05:25:46.260 --> 05:25:48.562
THEN SECOND OF ALL ONCE THERE'S

LET'S SAY TEN OF THOSE.

05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:51.798
IS THERE THE FEELING OR NEED BY

05:25:51.865 --> 05:25:53.634
THIS PEER REVIEWED DEPENDING ON

05:25:53.700 --> 05:25:55.068
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THAT.

05:25:55.135 --> 05:25:55.903
WHICH IS OUT OF ALL OF OUR

05:25:55.969 --> 05:25:58.305
CONTROL THEN -- WHETHER OR NOT

05:25:58.372 --> 05:26:00.540
YOU WILL QUALIFY ARE NOT BECAUSE

05:26:00.607 --> 05:26:01.775
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE WHO DOES

05:26:01.842 --> 05:26:03.844

TO PEER REVIEW TRULY BE AS A

05:26:13.287 --> 05:26:14.721
QUESTION WAS ASKED EARLIER.

A DOCTOR THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY

05:26:16.723 --> 05:26:17.624

IMMUNOGLOBULIN THERAPY GETS

I THINK IT ADDRESSED A LOT OF

05:30:32.412 --> 05:30:34.014
ISSUES.

05:30:34.080 --> 05:30:35.882
WHEN I ASKED LA USD TO PRODUCE

05:30:35.949 --> 05:30:38.151

05:30:53.400 --> 05:30:54.668
THE I BELIEVE IT'S SOMEWHERE ON

05:30:54.734 --> 05:30:56.603
91%.

05:30:56.670 --> 05:30:58.238
UP MOST OF THE PLACES ARE

05:30:58.305 --> 05:31:01.741
ANYWHERE FROM 94% TO ABOUT 93%

05:31:01.808 --> 05:31:03.310
92%.

05:31:03.376 --> 05:31:05.412
UNFORTUNATELY THE ONE SECTION

05:31:05.478 --> 05:31:07.247
WHICH IS THE WEST SIDE OF LA U.

05:31:07.314 --> 05:31:10.350
S. THE IS AT 87% AND THAT'S WHY

05:31:10.417 --> 05:31:11.218
IT'S WEIGHING DOWN THE AVERAGE

05:31:11.284 --> 05:31:11.518
[inaudible]

05:31:11.585 --> 05:31:13.587

WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW.

05:31:26.933 --> 05:31:29.135
BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT.

05:31:29.202 --> 05:31:31.338
BUT FOR A FIVE AND A HALF HOURS

05:31:31.404 --> 05:31:34.608

KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND A CHILD

05:35:19.833 --> 05:35:22.368
WHO HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION --

05:35:22.435 --> 05:35:24.237
IS TO TRY AND LIKELY TO GET

05:35:24.304 --> 05:35:25.305
VACCINATED AND IF THEY HAVE A

05:35:25.371 --> 05:35:26.806
GENUINE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SHOULD

05:35:26.873 --> 05:35:28.308
BE VACCINATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR

05:35:28.374 --> 05:35:29.476

EXEMPTION I'M SORRY BUT I GOT TO

05:35:30.443 --> 05:35:31.544
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE BECAUSE

05:35:31.611 --> 05:35:33.046
WHEN YOU'RE POINTING OUT TO THE

05:35:33.112 --> 05:35:34.814
EXAMPLES OF THE OUTBREAKS.

05:35:34.881 --> 05:35:38.751

05:35:40.487 --> 05:35:41.955
TO THAT SO FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALL

05:35:42.021 --> 05:35:44.357
RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS -- TWO

05:35:44.424 --> 05:35:46.259
SEVEN SEVEN IS -- WAS DOING ITS

05:35:46.326 --> 05:35:47.894
JOB ALL RIGHT -- EVEN THOUGH

05:35:47.961 --> 05:35:49.662
IT'S ONLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR

05:35:49.729 --> 05:35:51.264
THREE YEARS NOW BUT WE ALSO NOTE

05:35:51.331 --> 05:35:54.767
WAS IS THAT THE SO WE AFTER --

05:35:54.834 --> 05:35:55.301
TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE GOT THE

05:35:55.368 --> 05:35:57.203
MUSICIAN RATE -- FOR OVERALL

05:35:57.270 --> 05:36:00.907

05:36:00.974 --> 05:36:02.709
FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT'S NOW

05:36:02.775 --> 05:36:03.610
ACTUALLY ENFORCING SLIP BELOW

05:36:03.676 --> 05:36:05.945
THAT -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS

05:36:06.012 --> 05:36:07.514
THAT WE HAVE SCHOOLS OF MEDICAL

05:36:07.580 --> 05:36:10.650
EXEMPTION RATES OF 10% OF OVER A

05:36:10.717 --> 05:36:12.385
HUNDRED SCHOOLS OVER 10% SO THE

05:36:12.452 --> 05:36:13.887
QUESTION IS IS AND IT'S NOT THE

05:36:13.953 --> 05:36:14.921
SCHOOL DISTRICT RATE IT'S THE

05:36:14.988 --> 05:36:16.289
SCHOOL RIGHT IN FACT THAT'S A

05:36:16.356 --> 05:36:17.657
TRIGGER ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL

05:36:17.724 --> 05:36:18.291
NOT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO YOU.

05:36:18.358 --> 05:36:19.792
MENTIONED THERE SOME SCHOOLS IN

05:36:19.859 --> 05:36:21.928
PARTICULAR PARTS OF LA U. S. T.

05:36:21.995 --> 05:36:23.196
THAT HAVE LOWERED THAT THAT'S

05:36:23.263 --> 05:36:24.063
WHAT WOULD TRIGGER IT'S NOT THE

05:36:24.130 --> 05:36:26.132
OVERALL SCHOOL DISTRICT -- I

05:36:26.199 --> 05:36:28.868
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT.

05:36:28.935 --> 05:36:30.537
RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT.

05:36:30.603 --> 05:36:32.872
MOST OF THE MORE READ THIS THIS

05:36:32.939 --> 05:36:35.041
YEAR'S IT ARE IN -- YOUNG ADULTS

05:36:35.108 --> 05:36:36.809
ACTUALLY -- SOMETIMES A CALL

05:36:36.876 --> 05:36:38.678
THAT THE WEEK FEEL GENERATION --

05:36:38.745 --> 05:36:40.780
THOSE ARE THE FOR KIDS KIDS --

05:36:40.847 --> 05:36:42.015
TO THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO THE

05:36:42.081 --> 05:36:43.383
REASON ARE NOW YOUNG ADULTS

05:36:43.449 --> 05:36:44.317
DATING GET VACCINATED WHEN THEY

05:36:44.384 --> 05:36:44.784
WERE.

05:36:44.851 --> 05:36:46.553
CHILDREN RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S

05:36:46.619 --> 05:36:47.787
WHEN ANDREW WAKEFIELD CAME OUT

05:36:47.854 --> 05:36:51.057
WITH THE STUDY THAT -- BASICALLY --

05:36:51.124 --> 05:36:52.559
FALSELY CLAIMED THAT VACCINES

05:36:52.625 --> 05:36:55.161
CAUSE AUTISM FRIGHTENED MANY OF

05:36:55.228 --> 05:36:56.195
PARENTS FROM WILL BE ON THEIR

05:36:56.262 --> 05:36:57.196
BACKS AND THEY'D BUT WELL

05:36:57.263 --> 05:36:57.830
UNFORTUNATELY NOT BEYOND THAT

05:36:57.897 --> 05:36:59.599
BECAUSE THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE

05:36:59.666 --> 05:37:10.176
UNVACCINATED CHILDREN THAT HAVE

05:37:10.243 --> 05:37:11.077
BEEN GETTING THE MEASLES IN

05:37:11.144 --> 05:37:11.511
CALIFORNIA.

05:37:11.578 --> 05:37:12.812
AND WE ALSO SAW THIS BY THE WAY

05:37:12.879 --> 05:37:14.714
IN ENGLAND AS WELL HE'S -- SO SO

05:37:14.781 --> 05:37:15.615
SO YOU'RE RIGHT NOW OF A LOT OF

05:37:15.682 --> 05:37:16.916
THE CASES -- ARE IN YOUNG ADULTS

05:37:16.983 --> 05:37:18.351
IN TERMS OF THIS -- THIS

05:37:18.418 --> 05:37:19.018
PARTICULAR -- YEAR IN TERMS OF

05:37:19.085 --> 05:37:20.053
WE LOOK AT WHAT THE MEASLES

05:37:20.119 --> 05:37:20.353
CASES ARE.

05:37:20.420 --> 05:37:22.488
WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE

05:37:22.555 --> 05:37:24.724
DON'T WANT TO GO ACTUALLY?

05:37:24.791 --> 05:37:25.792
YEAH ADD TO THE GROUP OF PEOPLE

05:37:25.858 --> 05:37:26.793
OR AN VACCINATED RIGHT SO IS

05:37:26.859 --> 05:37:28.328
AGAIN AS YOU MEMBERS A CO AUTHOR

05:37:28.394 --> 05:37:29.495
OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IT'S

05:37:29.562 --> 05:37:30.830
REALLY ADDRESSING IT YEAR BY

05:37:30.897 --> 05:37:31.831
YEAR SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WHEN

05:37:31.898 --> 05:37:33.333
WE SAY WHAT'S THE VACCINATION

05:37:33.399 --> 05:37:34.067
RATES REALLY ONLY THE

05:37:34.133 --> 05:37:36.603
VACCINATION RATE. FOR THE

05:37:36.669 --> 05:37:37.971
KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF THAT YEAR.

05:37:38.037 --> 05:37:39.005
YEAH I IT'S NOT THE VACCINATION

05:37:39.072 --> 05:37:40.406
RATE FOR ALL THE SUBSEQUENT YEAH

05:37:40.473 --> 05:37:41.441
ALL THE YEARS AHEAD OF THEM YOU

05:37:41.507 --> 05:37:42.642
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN THEY WERE

05:37:42.709 --> 05:37:44.544
KINDERGARTNERS THE END IDEA

05:37:44.611 --> 05:37:45.778
ABOUT ROUGHLY WHERE THEY ARE.

05:37:45.845 --> 05:37:46.779
YOU'RE RIGHT SOME YOU KNOW ONE

05:37:46.846 --> 05:37:48.281
OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S NOT ALL

05:37:48.348 --> 05:37:49.816
JUST ABOUT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

05:37:49.882 --> 05:37:51.117
RIGHT SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE

05:37:51.184 --> 05:37:52.285
DEFINITELY NEED TO PUBLIC HEALTH

05:37:52.352 --> 05:37:53.620
IS DONE IS WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO

05:37:53.686 --> 05:37:54.654
BE SURE.

05:37:54.721 --> 05:37:56.255
KIDS WHO HAD CONDITIONAL ONES

05:37:56.322 --> 05:37:57.190
THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWINGUP TO

05:37:57.256 --> 05:37:58.391
BE SURE THEY GOT THE REMAINDER

05:37:58.458 --> 05:37:59.959
OF THEIR VACCINATIONS RIGHT WE

05:38:00.026 --> 05:38:01.961
NEED TO BE SURE CHILDREN ACCESS

05:38:02.028 --> 05:38:03.162
TO HEALTH CARE.

05:38:03.229 --> 05:38:04.063
RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHY WITH THE

05:38:04.130 --> 05:38:05.431
VACCINE FOR CHILDREN FIND WE'VE

05:38:05.498 --> 05:38:07.834
ACTUALLY SPEND IT -- ACCESS TO

05:38:07.900 --> 05:38:09.969
MEDICARE FOR FOR FOR CHILDREN

05:38:10.036 --> 05:38:11.004
WHO ARE TEN WHO WHO LIVE IN OUR

05:38:11.070 --> 05:38:12.572
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT WAY

05:38:12.639 --> 05:38:13.840
THEY CAN GET THEIR VACCINES IT'S

05:38:13.906 --> 05:38:15.842
NOT A ECONOMIC BARRIER TO GET

05:38:15.908 --> 05:38:17.510
THE VACCINATIONS.

05:38:17.577 --> 05:38:19.579
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE

05:38:19.646 --> 05:38:21.848
EXEMPTION RATE HAS QUADRUPLED

05:38:21.914 --> 05:38:22.949
AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT

05:38:23.016 --> 05:38:24.584
ACTUALLY YOU ADD PERMANENT SO BY

05:38:24.651 --> 05:38:25.918
THE WAY IF YOU HAVE PERMANENT

05:38:25.985 --> 05:38:27.153
AND TEMPORARY.

05:38:27.220 --> 05:38:28.388
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS YOU'RE

05:38:28.454 --> 05:38:30.556
ACTUALLY ABOVE ONE POINT 1% AND

05:38:30.623 --> 05:38:32.125
THIS IS THE CHALLENGES THIS IF

05:38:32.191 --> 05:38:33.760
WE DO NOTHING AND IT KEEPS GOING

05:38:33.826 --> 05:38:35.194
UP AT THE CURRENT RATE.

05:38:35.261 --> 05:38:36.663
WE ARE GOING TO BE BACK IN THE

05:38:36.729 --> 05:38:39.999
SAME PROBLEM WE HAD THE FOUR TWO

05:38:40.066 --> 05:38:40.833
SEVEN SEVEN I MEAN.

05:38:40.900 --> 05:38:41.868
WE WE COULD YOU KNOW AND SO WE

05:38:41.934 --> 05:38:44.537
SEE THE TREND LINE MISTRANSLATED

05:38:44.604 --> 05:38:45.605
TREND LINES WHICH IS.

05:38:45.672 --> 05:38:48.307
CONTINUING TO INCREASE SO YEAH

05:38:48.374 --> 05:38:49.909
SO BUT PLEASE.

05:38:49.976 --> 05:38:51.010
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT SO

05:38:51.077 --> 05:38:52.578
WHY NOT FIRST FIGURE OUT WHY THE

05:38:52.645 --> 05:38:55.815
TREND IS GOING BACK UP AGAIN

05:38:55.882 --> 05:38:58.051
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHY THAT THE PAR

05:38:58.117 --> 05:38:58.618
PUBLIC HEALTH IS LOOK AT YOU

05:38:58.685 --> 05:38:59.585
KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T EXACTLY

05:38:59.652 --> 05:39:00.887
KNOW HOW MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS

05:39:00.953 --> 05:39:02.555
WHO ARE GOING FOR PERSONAL

05:39:02.622 --> 05:39:03.556
BELIEF EXEMPIONS.

05:39:03.623 --> 05:39:05.091
MAY HAVE NOT WANTED TO GET A

05:39:05.158 --> 05:39:13.566
MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO YEP.

05:39:13.633 --> 05:39:14.434
WE DON'T THERE'S A LOT OF

05:39:14.500 --> 05:39:15.401
QUESTIONS WE STILL DON'T KNOW.

05:39:15.468 --> 05:39:16.769
SO INSTEAD OF JUMPING TO A

05:39:16.836 --> 05:39:17.804
LEGISLATIVE FIX WELL I I WOULD

05:39:17.870 --> 05:39:19.005
REFER YOU TO ACTUALLY RESEARCH

05:39:19.072 --> 05:39:20.506
DONE BY DOCTOR OVER SAY AT HIS

05:39:20.573 --> 05:39:21.107
TO LOOK AT THESE DATA THERE'S

05:39:21.174 --> 05:39:21.741
BEEN NUMEROUS PAPERS PUBLISHED

05:39:21.808 --> 05:39:22.942
ABOUT WHAT'S.

05:39:23.009 --> 05:39:24.944
HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AFTER TWO

05:39:25.011 --> 05:39:25.611
SEVEN SEVEN BECAUSE AFTER ALL WE

05:39:25.678 --> 05:39:26.846
ARE THE FIRST STATE TO HAVE

05:39:26.913 --> 05:39:28.147
ROLLED BACK THE NONMEDICAL

05:39:28.214 --> 05:39:30.249
EXEMPTIONS SO RESEARCHERS HAVE

05:39:30.316 --> 05:39:31.250
BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING

05:39:31.317 --> 05:39:31.551
WHAT HAVE.

05:39:31.617 --> 05:39:33.086
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE THING

05:39:33.152 --> 05:39:34.921
THEY MADE NOTE OF THE BIGGEST

05:39:34.987 --> 05:39:37.156
PROBLEM THAT'S HAPPENED AFTER

05:39:37.223 --> 05:39:38.624
TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS A RISE IN?

05:39:38.691 --> 05:39:41.027
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT IS

05:39:41.094 --> 05:39:42.195
THAT'S WHY THERE IS THAT STUDY

05:39:42.261 --> 05:39:42.762
AS FOLLOWS IN PEDIATRICS THE

05:39:42.829 --> 05:39:44.530
TALK -- TO COUNTY HEALTH

05:39:44.597 --> 05:39:45.398
OFFICERS.

05:39:45.465 --> 05:39:46.599
WHO MAY KNOW THAT THAT WAS A BIG

05:39:46.666 --> 05:39:48.968
PROBLEM BY THE WAY NOT EVERY

05:39:49.035 --> 05:39:50.436
PERSON IS ACTUALLY REFERRED TO

05:39:50.503 --> 05:39:52.672
THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR FOR A FOR

05:39:52.739 --> 05:39:54.340
A COMPLAINT TO EAT WE NEED A

05:39:54.407 --> 05:39:55.341
ALWAYS HEARD FROM SCHOOL NURSES?

05:39:55.408 --> 05:39:56.709
WE UP PEOPLE LOOKED AT SO WHAT

05:39:56.776 --> 05:39:57.977
HAPPENED TO THE CONDITIONALS

05:39:58.044 --> 05:39:59.245
WHAT HAPPENS IS AS YOU JUST THE

05:39:59.312 --> 05:40:00.847
PAPER PUBLISHED.

05:40:00.913 --> 05:40:02.715
RECENTLY IN PEDIATRICS LOOK AT

05:40:02.782 --> 05:40:03.750
ALL THE DIFFERENT POTENTIAL

05:40:03.816 --> 05:40:05.451
CATEGORIES CALLED SUBSTITUTION

05:40:05.518 --> 05:40:06.786
EFFECT RIGHT SO WHO HAD PERSONAL

05:40:06.853 --> 05:40:08.855
BELIEF EXEMPTIONS BEFORE WHAT

05:40:08.921 --> 05:40:10.556
WAS THAT RATE NOW TO SEND SEVEN

05:40:10.623 --> 05:40:11.424
THAT'S DRIVEN THAT DOWN THE

05:40:11.491 --> 05:40:12.658
CENTURY THE ZERO SO WHAT'S

05:40:12.725 --> 05:40:14.293
HAPPENING NOW AND BASICALLY THEY

05:40:14.360 --> 05:40:15.928
SAID IT'S BEING REPLACED BY.

05:40:15.995 --> 05:40:17.230
YOU KNOW SLOWLY OVER TIME BY

05:40:17.296 --> 05:40:18.297
MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AS MEDICAL

05:40:18.364 --> 05:40:19.132
ATTENTION RATES HAVE BEEN

05:40:19.198 --> 05:40:20.533
INCREASING SO THE RESEARCH IS

05:40:20.600 --> 05:40:22.335
BEING DONE THERE IS THERE ARE

05:40:22.401 --> 05:40:23.903
PUBLISHED PAPERS HAVE LOOKED AT

05:40:23.970 --> 05:40:25.171
THIS AND THEN A FIVE THIS IS THE

05:40:25.238 --> 05:40:27.173
PROBLEM I DIDN'T DO THIS BILL

05:40:27.240 --> 05:40:28.508
RIGHT AFTER WE DID.

05:40:28.574 --> 05:40:29.642
TWO SEVEN SEVEN RIGHT WE HAVE

05:40:29.709 --> 05:40:30.243
TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE HAVE THREE

05:40:30.309 --> 05:40:31.844
YEARS OF DATA NOW AND THE REASON

05:40:31.911 --> 05:40:33.045
I'M DOING THIS BILL NOW IS WE

05:40:33.112 --> 05:40:34.614
HAVE A LARGE MEASLES OUTBREAK

05:40:34.680 --> 05:40:36.249
AND THE RESEARCH HAS COME OUT OF

05:40:36.315 --> 05:40:38.284
WHAT'S HAPPENED POST.

05:40:38.351 --> 05:40:38.951
TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND WHAT'S GOING

05:40:39.018 --> 05:40:41.954
ON ARE WE LOSING WHAT WE TRY.

05:40:42.021 --> 05:40:42.755
TO THE GOALS THAT WE TRIED TO

05:40:42.822 --> 05:40:45.057
ACHIEVE A TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND

05:40:45.124 --> 05:40:47.260
THE RESEARCH IS SAYING YES NO

05:40:47.326 --> 05:40:48.561
BECAUSE OF MEDICAL EXAMS I'M

05:40:48.628 --> 05:40:49.328
GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE THE

05:40:49.395 --> 05:40:50.596
DATA IS ACTUALLY SHOWING THAT

05:40:50.663 --> 05:40:51.397
WERE IMPROVING.

05:40:51.464 --> 05:40:54.167
IMMUNIZATION IS ACTUALLY GONE UP

05:40:54.233 --> 05:40:56.569
NOW IF IF YOU'RE GONNA LET

05:40:56.636 --> 05:40:58.337
CERTAIN SUBSECTIONS.

05:40:58.404 --> 05:40:59.505
WILL WIN.

05:40:59.572 --> 05:41:00.940
THAT'S WHY I WAS REFERRING TO

05:41:01.007 --> 05:41:01.874
DALY U. S. THE NUMBERS WHEN I'M

05:41:01.941 --> 05:41:03.709
LOOKING AND SEEING THAT ALMOST

05:41:03.776 --> 05:41:05.711
EVERY SUBSECTION IN THE ENTIRE

05:41:05.778 --> 05:41:13.553
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

05:41:13.619 --> 05:41:15.855
HAS IMPROVED BY EITHER 2% 1% OR

05:41:15.922 --> 05:41:18.991
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE 2% --

05:41:19.058 --> 05:41:20.092
AGAIN THE EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE

05:41:20.159 --> 05:41:21.260
IN THE DISTRICT IS ABOVE 90% THE

05:41:21.327 --> 05:41:22.395
ONLY PLACE IS THE WEST SIDE

05:41:22.461 --> 05:41:22.862
WHICH IMPROVED FROM.

05:41:22.929 --> 05:41:24.764
WHICH ALSO IMPROVED BY A POINT

05:41:24.831 --> 05:41:26.132
BUT IT'S STILL BELOW 90% AND

05:41:26.199 --> 05:41:27.333
IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE

05:41:27.400 --> 05:41:29.035
HERD IMMUNITY LEVEL I UNDERSTAND

05:41:29.101 --> 05:41:32.371
THAT AND I WANT TO HELP.

05:41:32.438 --> 05:41:32.805
IN ADDRESSING THAT.

05:41:32.872 --> 05:41:34.707
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

05:41:34.774 --> 05:41:36.275
NECESSARILY ADDRESSES IT WHEN IT

05:41:36.342 --> 05:41:39.078
GOES AFTER SUCH A SMALL SEGMENT.

05:41:39.145 --> 05:41:40.379
AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO FIGURE

05:41:40.446 --> 05:41:43.115
OUT HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN GO

05:41:43.182 --> 05:41:44.183
AFTER YOU KNOW.

05:41:44.250 --> 05:41:46.052
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER TO

05:41:46.118 --> 05:41:47.787
EDUCATION OR THROUGH OTHER

05:41:47.854 --> 05:41:48.754
INCENTIVES.

05:41:48.821 --> 05:41:50.356
AMONG THE NON COMPLIANCE

05:41:50.423 --> 05:41:52.358
STUDENTS AND PARENTS WERE

05:41:52.425 --> 05:41:54.126
KEEPING THEIR KIDS NON COMPLIANT.

05:41:54.193 --> 05:41:54.727
SO.

05:41:54.794 --> 05:41:56.095
I THINK WE HAVE JUST SUCH A

05:41:56.162 --> 05:41:58.631
BIGGER MARK THAT WE CAN BE GOING

05:41:58.698 --> 05:42:01.000
AFTER RATHER THAN LOOK AT THIS

05:42:01.067 --> 05:42:03.502
NARROW AREA.

05:42:03.569 --> 05:42:04.871
THAT THAT IT IT THAT'S WHY I WAS

05:42:04.937 --> 05:42:06.839
ASKING STARTED BY ASKING WHAT IS

05:42:06.906 --> 05:42:08.407
IT EXACTLY THAT WERE AFTER

05:42:08.474 --> 05:42:10.743
BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO DISCIPLINE

05:42:10.810 --> 05:42:12.011
DOCTORS THE BILL DOESN'T

05:42:12.078 --> 05:42:16.249
NECESSARILY DO THAT -- BILL.

05:42:16.315 --> 05:42:16.949
I WOULD BEG TO DIFFER --

05:42:17.016 --> 05:42:20.786
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS

05:42:20.853 --> 05:42:21.654

WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE HARSHEST.

05:42:23.890 --> 05:42:26.626
HARSHEST DISCIPLINE IS ACTUALLY

05:42:26.692 --> 05:42:28.995

PERIOD.

05:42:32.632 --> 05:42:37.937
BLACK IS THAT IS THAT IS NOT THE

05:42:38.004 --> 05:42:39.872
HARSHEST THAT WE CAN DO.

05:42:39.939 --> 05:42:42.174

SAID TO BE A FRAUDULENT LEVEL OF

05:42:44.010 --> 05:42:45.244
ACTIVITY FIRST OF ALL I DON'T

05:42:45.311 --> 05:42:45.811
EVEN SEE THE DEFINITION OF

05:42:45.878 --> 05:42:47.246
FRAUDULENT REALLY IN THE MET IN

CAN WE MAYBE DISCUSS THAT AS

05:42:50.683 --> 05:42:52.485
WELL.

05:42:52.551 --> 05:42:52.985
I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW.

05:42:53.052 --> 05:42:55.087
YEAH.

05:42:55.154 --> 05:42:56.022
WHY DOESN'T THE BILL WHITE IS

05:42:56.088 --> 05:42:56.656
THE BILL HAVE A DEFINITION OF

05:42:56.722 --> 05:42:59.592
FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTION --

05:42:59.659 --> 05:43:02.328
REFERRING TO WHAT THE CDC ACAP

05:43:02.395 --> 05:43:05.231
AND EIGHTY P. CRITERIA.

05:43:05.298 --> 05:43:07.667
WOULD BE DENIED UNDER WHAT WHY

05:43:07.733 --> 05:43:09.135
IS IT THAT DAY AND WHAT THAT

05:43:09.201 --> 05:43:11.404
RIGHT TO BE A CHANGE OVER TIME

05:43:11.470 --> 05:43:15.675
SO AND JUST HEARING ROGER Là IS

05:43:15.741 --> 05:43:17.410
NOT IN THE BILL ANY LONGER.

05:43:17.476 --> 05:43:19.779
I I WOULD POINT OUT -- THE

05:43:19.845 --> 05:43:21.213
SENATE IS AREA AND THAT THE THE

05:43:21.280 --> 05:43:22.315
HIGHEST SANCTION WOULD ACTUALLY

05:43:22.381 --> 05:43:23.950
BE A LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE WHICH

05:43:24.016 --> 05:43:24.350
WOULD.

05:43:24.417 --> 05:43:24.984
MEAN YOU CAN'T PRACTICE ANYMORE

05:43:25.051 --> 05:43:25.818
AND OF COURSE LOTS OF THE

05:43:25.885 --> 05:43:28.187
LICENSE CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED BY

05:43:28.254 --> 05:43:29.755
THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA.

05:43:29.822 --> 05:43:31.123
SO WHEN YOU REFER TO THE TWO

05:43:31.190 --> 05:43:32.792
YEAR SUSPENSION THAT WAS THROUGH

05:43:32.858 --> 05:43:34.160
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

05:43:34.226 --> 05:43:35.227
BUT THAT WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED

05:43:35.294 --> 05:43:36.562
LANGUAGE FOR REFERRAL TO THE

05:43:36.629 --> 05:43:38.230
MEDICAL BOARD YOU'VE HEARD FROM

05:43:38.297 --> 05:43:39.298
THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT THEIR

05:43:39.365 --> 05:43:40.533
BIGGEST BARRIER IS.

05:43:40.599 --> 05:43:41.801
AN ABILITY TO GET THE

05:43:41.867 --> 05:43:42.868
INFORMATION THEY NEED FOR THEIR

05:43:42.935 --> 05:43:44.403
INVESTIGATION THEY CAN'T EVEN

05:43:44.470 --> 05:43:46.772
GET OFF FIRST BASE AND SO THIS

05:43:46.839 --> 05:43:47.573
BILL.

05:43:47.640 --> 05:43:49.241
I CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

05:43:49.308 --> 05:43:50.242
MEDICAL BOARD TO GET THAT

05:43:50.309 --> 05:43:51.610
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO

05:43:51.677 --> 05:43:53.179
CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS THAT

05:43:53.245 --> 05:43:54.814
INVESTIGATION CAN LEAD

05:43:54.880 --> 05:43:56.415
EVENTUALLY.

05:43:56.482 --> 05:43:58.317
TO VARIOUS PENALTIES UP TO LOSS

05:43:58.384 --> 05:44:00.353
OF THE MEDICAL LICENSE WHICH

05:44:00.419 --> 05:44:02.054
WOULD MEAN THAT THAT POSITION

05:44:02.121 --> 05:44:02.955
COULD NO LONGER PRACTICE IN THE

05:44:03.022 --> 05:44:04.857
STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M NOT SURE

05:44:04.924 --> 05:44:07.026
WHAT IF THERE'S OTHER PENALTIES

05:44:07.093 --> 05:44:08.861
ONE SUGGEST -- YOU CAN -- PLEASE

05:44:08.928 --> 05:44:11.530
DO SO BUT I I THINK THAT THAT IS

05:44:11.597 --> 05:44:13.766
THE THE HYATT THAT IS THE

05:44:13.833 --> 05:44:15.568
SANCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR

05:44:15.634 --> 05:44:17.436
PHYSICIANS WHO ARE AT FOR FOR

05:44:17.503 --> 05:44:20.773
ACTING UNPROFESSIONALLY

05:44:20.840 --> 05:44:24.543
UNETHICALLY.

05:44:24.610 --> 05:44:25.444
I AM.

05:44:25.511 --> 05:44:27.079
I'M SORRY DOCTOR BUT THAT'S NOT

05:44:27.146 --> 05:44:33.452
VERY CONVINCING -- HI.

05:44:33.519 --> 05:44:36.389
I WOULD HAVE WELL KNOW HOW MANY

05:44:36.455 --> 05:44:39.825
LICENSES HAVE BEEN LOST.

05:44:39.892 --> 05:44:40.993
YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT THERE WAS

05:44:41.060 --> 05:44:42.361
ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE

05:44:42.428 --> 05:44:42.962
WELL I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE

05:44:43.029 --> 05:44:43.562
IS CASES WERE NOT NECESSARILY

05:44:43.629 --> 05:44:44.897
GETTING COMPLAINTS ON MEDICAL

05:44:44.964 --> 05:44:45.498
EXEMPTIONS AND WHEN WE DO WE

05:44:45.564 --> 05:44:47.099
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET

05:44:47.166 --> 05:44:48.768
THE MEDICAL RECORDS AND MANY OF

05:44:48.834 --> 05:44:49.902
THESE CASES BECAUSE PARENTS

05:44:49.969 --> 05:44:50.269
AREN'T SIGNING.

05:44:50.336 --> 05:44:51.904
OFF ON RELEASING THOSE MEDICAL

05:44:51.971 --> 05:44:53.472
RECORDS SO THAT IS THAT THE

05:44:53.539 --> 05:44:55.574
OBSTACLES THAT WERE FACING RIGHT

05:44:55.641 --> 05:44:57.009
NOW SO WE DOING ANOTHER

05:44:57.076 --> 05:44:59.045
LEGISLATION TO ENSURE WERE.

05:44:59.111 --> 05:45:00.546
EXACTLY WHAT NOW SO BASICALLY

05:45:00.613 --> 05:45:02.481
ALLOW US TO GET THOSE MEDICAL

05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:04.417
RECORDS AND THEY WILL ALSO HAVE

05:45:04.483 --> 05:45:05.451
CD PIERCE COUNTY JUST TO

05:45:05.518 --> 05:45:09.922
LEGISLATION THAT EXACT IN A

05:45:09.989 --> 05:45:10.923
PRECISE WAY ALLOWS THAT.

05:45:10.990 --> 05:45:11.924
AUTHORIZES YOU AND GIVES YOU THE

05:45:11.991 --> 05:45:12.825
CAPABILITY OF DOING THE THINGS

05:45:12.892 --> 05:45:15.161
AS OPPOSED TO CREATING THIS

05:45:15.227 --> 05:45:16.028
PROCESS THAT.

05:45:16.095 --> 05:45:17.563
AT HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT THE COST

05:45:17.630 --> 05:45:19.498
OF WITH

05:45:19.565 --> 05:45:21.100
THIS IS POTENTIALLY GONNA MAN ON

05:45:21.167 --> 05:45:23.002
THIS IS NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEES

05:45:23.069 --> 05:45:27.807
THE POLICY COMMITTEE.

05:45:27.873 --> 05:45:28.641
OKAY HAS BEEN TO WITH BUSCA

05:45:28.707 --> 05:45:29.575
FISCAL COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE

05:45:29.642 --> 05:45:33.312
SO -- AND IT IS WITH US IT NOW

05:45:33.379 --> 05:45:33.913
AND THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE

05:45:33.979 --> 05:45:34.213
[inaudible]

05:45:34.280 --> 05:45:35.881
ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

05:45:35.948 --> 05:45:38.217
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT TO FEEL

05:45:38.284 --> 05:45:40.886
THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

05:45:40.953 --> 05:45:42.721
TO SET UP A PROCESS THAT WHOSE

05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:44.390
COST WE DON'T KNOW.

05:45:44.457 --> 05:45:45.591
THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THE VERY

05:45:45.658 --> 05:45:47.993
SMALL [inaudible]

05:45:48.060 --> 05:45:48.794
CONSTITUENCIES.

05:45:48.861 --> 05:45:51.397
VERSUS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ON

05:45:51.464 --> 05:45:54.900
A BIGGER PICTURE IF IF IF IF.

05:45:54.967 --> 05:45:56.569
MR SURE YOU DON'T MIND.

05:45:56.635 --> 05:45:59.071
I WANT TO KNOW FROM WHOEVER FROM

05:45:59.138 --> 05:46:00.606
THE OPPONENTS WANTS TO ANSWER.

05:46:00.673 --> 05:46:02.608
WHAT ENTAILS THE PROCEDURE

05:46:02.675 --> 05:46:04.577
EXAMINATION FOR A MEDICAL

05:46:04.643 --> 05:46:06.245
EXEMPTION BASED ON FAMILY

05:46:06.312 --> 05:46:08.581
MEDICAL HISTORY OR GENETICS

05:46:08.647 --> 05:46:09.648
TESTING THAT?

05:46:09.715 --> 05:46:11.117
YOU BELIEVE WILL NOT BE

05:46:11.183 --> 05:46:12.651
CONSIDERED BY THE STATE UNDER

05:46:12.718 --> 05:46:14.620
THE CDC GUIDELINES IF SOMEONE

05:46:14.687 --> 05:46:15.855
CAN ANSWER THAT

05:46:15.921 --> 05:46:21.994
I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW.

05:46:22.061 --> 05:46:23.362
AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE

05:46:23.429 --> 05:46:28.033
SUPPORTERS FOR THE SAME QUESTION.

05:46:28.100 --> 05:46:29.869
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD BE --

05:46:29.935 --> 05:46:32.071
MEDICAL EXEMPTION UNDER FAMILY

05:46:32.138 --> 05:46:33.072
HISTORY.

05:46:33.139 --> 05:46:36.142
THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY UNDER CDC

05:46:36.208 --> 05:46:36.442
GUIDELINES.

05:46:36.509 --> 05:46:37.643
THE QUESTION.

05:46:37.710 --> 05:46:39.512
IS IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO

05:46:39.578 --> 05:46:41.780
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE CDC

05:46:41.847 --> 05:46:43.149
GUIDELINES ARE AND THAT THE

05:46:43.215 --> 05:46:44.917
SENATOR DID ANSWER ABOUT THE

05:46:44.984 --> 05:46:47.620
ONLY CDC FAMILY HISTORY

05:46:47.686 --> 05:46:48.287
GUIDELINE.

05:46:48.354 --> 05:46:50.422
IS IF A MOM OR DAD OR FIRST

05:46:50.489 --> 05:46:52.358
DEGREE RELATIVE HAS A SEVERE

05:46:52.424 --> 05:46:54.460
IMMUNE DEFICIENCY.

05:46:54.527 --> 05:46:55.861
AND OF THE CHILDREN MIGHT HAPPEN.

05:46:55.928 --> 05:46:57.463
THE ONLY EXEMPTS YOU FROM MMR

05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:58.564
CHICKENPOX VACCINE.

05:46:58.631 --> 05:47:00.266
THAT'S THE ONLY FAMILY HISTORY

05:47:00.332 --> 05:47:04.837
FACTOR IN ALL THE GUIDELINES

05:47:04.904 --> 05:47:06.572
THAT ARE IN THIS BILL.

05:47:06.639 --> 05:47:07.940
THERE'S A SMALL FAMILIES YOU

05:47:08.007 --> 05:47:09.341
FACTOR ABOUT CAESAR'S OF

05:47:09.408 --> 05:47:10.109
SOMEONE'S HAD SEIZURES YOU CAN

05:47:10.176 --> 05:47:12.211
GET THIS ONE BRAND OF VACCINES.

05:47:12.278 --> 05:47:13.946
YOU CAN GET OTHER BROWN'S THAT

05:47:14.013 --> 05:47:15.281
THAT QUALIFY SO THAT DOESN'T

05:47:15.347 --> 05:47:17.049
WORK SO THERE'S ONLY ONE FAMILY

05:47:17.116 --> 05:47:17.883
HISTORY FACTOR.

05:47:17.950 --> 05:47:19.018
STUDENTS HAVE TO REALIZE FOR

05:47:19.084 --> 05:47:21.954
EXAMPLE ALL SEE A FAMILY.

05:47:22.021 --> 05:47:22.955
THE MOM HAD A SEIZURE AFTER

05:47:23.022 --> 05:47:27.126
VACCINES HER FIRST CHILD HAD A

05:47:27.193 --> 05:47:30.529
SEIZURE AFTER VACCINES -- AND

05:47:30.596 --> 05:47:31.463
SHE HAS A NEW BABY AND SHE

05:47:31.530 --> 05:47:32.865
DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THAT BABY

05:47:32.932 --> 05:47:34.200
VACCINES AND OTHER DOCTOR I

05:47:34.266 --> 05:47:34.533
WOULD AGREE.

05:47:34.600 --> 05:47:35.467
THAT'S A GOOD FAMILY HISTORY

05:47:35.534 --> 05:47:38.070
REASON NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR

05:47:38.137 --> 05:47:42.107
CHILD -- OR MAYBE TO BE DELAY

05:47:42.174 --> 05:47:43.375
THEM DO A TOLL YEARS LATER I

05:47:43.442 --> 05:47:44.577
DON'T KNOW MAYBE THE TEMPORARY

05:47:44.643 --> 05:47:45.811
EXEMPTION IS THEIR BABY.

05:47:45.878 --> 05:47:47.246
THERE IS NO SINGLE CDC

05:47:47.313 --> 05:47:49.081
GUIDELINES THAT WOULD ALLOW ME

05:47:49.148 --> 05:47:50.583
TO WRITE THAT EXEMPTION UNDER

05:47:50.649 --> 05:47:52.051
THIS NEW LAW.

05:47:52.117 --> 05:47:53.652
DID NO FAMILY HISTORY INVOLVED

05:47:53.719 --> 05:47:54.987
WHATSOEVER THAT I THAT WOULD

05:47:55.054 --> 05:47:57.523
JUSTIFY ME WRITING EXEMPTION FOR

05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:59.491
THAT FAMILY BECAUSE THAT IS NOT

05:47:59.558 --> 05:48:02.528
IN THE CDC OR THE A. P. OR THE

05:48:02.595 --> 05:48:03.629
ACIP GUIDELINES.

05:48:03.696 --> 05:48:04.863
AND APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE

05:48:04.930 --> 05:48:05.931
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF ASKED A LOT

05:48:05.998 --> 05:48:07.166
ABOUT FAMILY HISTORY.

05:48:07.233 --> 05:48:09.068
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HOW NARROW

05:48:09.134 --> 05:48:10.069
THAT IS.

05:48:10.135 --> 05:48:11.637
THIS NEW AMENDMENT DID NOT

05:48:11.704 --> 05:48:13.706
BROUGHT IN THAT IN ANY WAY

05:48:13.772 --> 05:48:15.507
EXCEPT FOR THE SELECT FEW AS AS

05:48:15.574 --> 05:48:18.077
THE THE LADIES EXAMPLE -- RIGHT

05:48:18.143 --> 05:48:19.712
SO THERE'S SO MANY BUT I MEAN I

05:48:19.778 --> 05:48:21.280
COULD LIST SO MANY SEVERE

05:48:21.347 --> 05:48:23.249
REACTIONS OF SEEN MOMS OR DADS

05:48:23.315 --> 05:48:25.317
HAVE OR THEIR FIRST KIDS HAVE

05:48:25.384 --> 05:48:26.585
AFTER VACCINES.

05:48:26.652 --> 05:48:28.153
THAT I WILL USE AS LEGITIMATE

05:48:28.220 --> 05:48:29.688
FAMILY HISTORY TO WRITE AN

05:48:29.755 --> 05:48:31.190

THE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU

05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:40.366

05:48:52.711 --> 05:48:56.682
HER IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

05:48:56.749 --> 05:48:58.417
MY SON WAS COMPENSATED BY THE

05:48:58.484 --> 05:48:59.385
VACCINE INJURY COURTS -- HE WAS

05:48:59.451 --> 05:48:59.985
ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED WITH SERUM

05:49:00.052 --> 05:49:00.786
SICKNESS AS A RESULT OF HIS

05:49:00.853 --> 05:49:02.354
EIGHTEEN MONTH WELL BABY VISIT --

05:49:02.421 --> 05:49:06.225
VACCINES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT --

05:49:06.292 --> 05:49:08.460
I FOUND WAS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW

05:49:08.527 --> 05:49:10.296
THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING VACCINE

05:49:10.362 --> 05:49:12.998
ISSUES PRIOR TO THAT LAST

05:49:13.065 --> 05:49:14.333
REACTION THAT HE HAD THAT WAS

05:49:14.400 --> 05:49:16.035
HIS MOST SEVERE WHICH HAD HIM IN

05:49:16.101 --> 05:49:17.736
AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL FOR

05:49:17.803 --> 05:49:19.805
EIGHT LONG WEEKS -- HE WAS SEEN

05:49:19.872 --> 05:49:21.907
BY MULTIPLE SPECIALIST HE HAD

05:49:21.974 --> 05:49:24.677
SEIZURES HE HAD A A CONDITION

05:49:24.743 --> 05:49:26.512
CALLED THROMBOSIS I TOOK PINA

05:49:26.578 --> 05:49:28.314
CORPORATE WHERE HE LOOKED LIKE

05:49:28.380 --> 05:49:29.982
HE HAD BRUISING ALL OVER HIS

05:49:30.049 --> 05:49:32.518
BODY -- SO OVER THE COURSE OF

05:49:32.584 --> 05:49:34.353
THE WHOLE ENTIRE ON EIGHT WEEKS

05:49:34.420 --> 05:49:35.187
THAT WE WERE IN AND OUT OF THE

05:49:35.254 --> 05:49:37.356
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALISTS OFFICE

05:49:37.423 --> 05:49:40.326
NOT ONE OF THOSE -- THE

05:49:40.392 --> 05:49:42.361
SPECIALIST -- WELL ALL OF THEM

05:49:42.428 --> 05:49:44.730
ACTUALLY ASKED ME IF HE HAD A

05:49:44.797 --> 05:49:45.998
HISTOGRAM A HISTORY OF SITS IN

05:49:46.065 --> 05:49:47.933
OUR FAMILY IF WE HAD A HISTORY

05:49:48.000 --> 05:49:49.568
OF AUTOIMMUNE CONDITIONS IN THE

05:49:49.635 --> 05:49:51.070
FAMILY IF HE HAD.

05:49:51.136 --> 05:49:53.238
EXISTING AUTO IMMUNE CONDITIONS

05:49:53.305 --> 05:49:55.007
AND WHEN I ASKED WHY IT WAS THAT

05:49:55.074 --> 05:49:55.841
THEY WERE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS

05:49:55.908 --> 05:49:56.942
THEY SAID THAT THOSE WERE ALL

05:49:57.009 --> 05:49:58.277
COUNTRY INDICATIONS OF VACCINE

05:49:58.344 --> 05:49:59.244
REACTIONS.

05:49:59.311 --> 05:50:00.446
THEY ALSO ASKED ME IF HE HAD

05:50:00.512 --> 05:50:02.414
PRIOR VACCINE REACTIONS I DIDN'T

05:50:02.481 --> 05:50:04.483
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT HE HAD OR

05:50:04.550 --> 05:50:06.618
NOT I DUTIFULLY TOOK MY CHILD IN

05:50:06.685 --> 05:50:07.953
FOR EVERY WELL BABY VISIT HADN'T

05:50:08.020 --> 05:50:08.821
VACCINATED.

05:50:08.887 --> 05:50:11.156
WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS THAT --

05:50:11.223 --> 05:50:12.691
THE IMMUNOLOGIST -- HAD

05:50:12.758 --> 05:50:14.593
SUGGESTED THAT WE CROSS

05:50:14.660 --> 05:50:16.362
REFERENCE HIS RECORD GET HIS

05:50:16.428 --> 05:50:17.496
MEDICAL RECORDS AND CROSS

05:50:17.563 --> 05:50:19.765
REFERENCES VACCINE RECORDS TO

05:50:19.832 --> 05:50:21.567
ALL OF THE TIMES THAT HE WAS

05:50:21.633 --> 05:50:23.635
ADMITTED INTO THE MURDER ZERO OR

05:50:23.702 --> 05:50:25.838
HAD -- ON SCHEDULE OF A DOCTOR'S

05:50:25.904 --> 05:50:27.906
VISIT WE ENDED UP FINDING OUT

05:50:27.973 --> 05:50:29.608
THAT HE HAD -- WITHIN FORTY

05:50:29.675 --> 05:50:31.009
EIGHT HOURS HE HAD SYMPTOMS THAT

05:50:31.076 --> 05:50:33.679
MATCHED THE HEPATITIS B.

05:50:33.746 --> 05:50:37.416
MANUFACTURE INSERTS AND THE HIS

05:50:37.483 --> 05:50:38.951
TWELVE MONTH BABY VISIT --

05:50:39.017 --> 05:50:40.753
MANUFACTURE INSERTS AS WELL --

05:50:40.819 --> 05:50:42.388
AND OF COURSE AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS

05:50:42.454 --> 05:50:44.356
OLD HE THE REACTIONS THAT HE WAS

05:50:44.423 --> 05:50:46.024
SHOWING WHICH THEY DID DETERMINE

05:50:46.091 --> 05:50:49.294
WERE A RESULT OF THOSE VACCINES --

05:50:49.361 --> 05:50:51.263
ALSO MATCH THE MANUFACTURE

05:50:51.330 --> 05:50:53.732
INSERTS FOR THE SYMPTOMS -- ALL

05:50:53.799 --> 05:50:55.701
OF THOSEINCIDENTS WERE VIABLE

05:50:55.768 --> 05:50:58.604
IN TERMS OF THE VACCINE INJURY

05:50:58.670 --> 05:51:00.305
COMPENSATION PROGRAM.

05:51:00.372 --> 05:51:02.841
AND I DID -- HE WAS AWARDED

05:51:02.908 --> 05:51:10.816
THROUGH THE VACCINE COURT AND

05:51:10.883 --> 05:51:11.717
THERE WAS ONLY A FEW.

05:51:11.784 --> 05:51:12.785
DOCTORS THAT ACTUALLY KNEW WHAT

05:51:12.851 --> 05:51:14.086
WAS GOING ON SO WHEN YOU WERE

05:51:14.153 --> 05:51:15.454
SPEAKING TO THE FACT I FORGET

05:51:15.521 --> 05:51:16.855
WHO WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE

05:51:16.922 --> 05:51:18.424
SPECIALIST -- WHO UNDERSTAND

05:51:18.490 --> 05:51:19.191
VACCINE INJURY [inaudible]

05:51:19.258 --> 05:51:20.759
MY CHILD.

05:51:20.826 --> 05:51:22.895
HAD TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL

05:51:22.961 --> 05:51:25.230
VACCINE INJURIES WITH SEVERAL

05:51:25.297 --> 05:51:26.598
DIFFERENT ACTIONS I KNOW THAT

05:51:26.665 --> 05:51:27.966
MOST OF US KNOW WHEN WE TAKE OUR

05:51:28.033 --> 05:51:29.368
CHILD AND IF NOT USUALLY JUST

05:51:29.435 --> 05:51:30.903
ONE VACCINE THAT YOU'RE GETTING.

05:51:30.969 --> 05:51:32.604
SO ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH MY

05:51:32.671 --> 05:51:33.939
CHILD AND THE REASON THAT HE

05:51:34.006 --> 05:51:35.641
ENDED UP RECEIVING I'M A MEDICAL

05:51:35.707 --> 05:51:37.142
EXEMPTION WHICH WAS PRIOR TO SB

05:51:37.209 --> 05:51:38.577
TWO SEVEN BEFORE ALL OF THIS

05:51:38.644 --> 05:51:39.711
LEGISLATION START HAPPENING.

05:51:39.778 --> 05:51:43.148
WAS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT NOT

05:51:43.215 --> 05:51:44.817
ONE MEDICAL EXPERT COULD

05:51:44.883 --> 05:51:47.319
PINPOINT WHAT COMPONENT OF WHICH

05:51:47.386 --> 05:51:49.488
VACCINE HE RECEIVED BECAUSE OF

05:51:49.555 --> 05:51:50.722
THE REACTION BECAUSE WE RECEIVE

05:51:50.789 --> 05:51:51.590
SO MANY DIFFERENT.

05:51:51.657 --> 05:51:54.259
VACCINES AND MOST CHILDREN DO AT

05:51:54.326 --> 05:51:55.961
A BABY VISIT THEY DON'T NESTING

05:51:56.028 --> 05:51:58.697
AND I MEAN WE DON'T NORMALLY GET

05:51:58.764 --> 05:51:59.865
ONE TAXING IN A BABY VISIT

05:51:59.932 --> 05:52:02.000
THERE'S USUALLY OF MANY VACCINES.

05:52:02.067 --> 05:52:04.069
SO WITH THAT HE WAS GIVEN A

05:52:04.136 --> 05:52:07.606
PERMIT -- MEDICAL EXEMPTION DUE

05:52:07.673 --> 05:52:08.740
TO THE FACT THAT NO ONE COULD

05:52:08.807 --> 05:52:09.741
TELL ME WHAT COMPONENT OF THE

05:52:09.808 --> 05:52:12.177
VACCINES AND I FOUND OUT THAT IT

05:52:12.244 --> 05:52:14.046
COULD HAVE BEEN A REACTION -- TO

05:52:14.112 --> 05:52:15.848
THE FETAL CELLS THAT WERE THERE

05:52:15.914 --> 05:52:17.850
ON THEIR IN VACCINES IT COULD

05:52:17.916 --> 05:52:19.818
HAVE BEEN THAT -- OTHER TOXINS

05:52:19.885 --> 05:52:21.453
LIKE FORMALDEHYDE AND ALL THE

05:52:21.520 --> 05:52:22.688
OTHER INGREDIENTS NO ONE COULD

05:52:22.754 --> 05:52:24.756
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS SO

05:52:24.823 --> 05:52:27.192
WITH THAT HE HAD TO HAVE -- AIDS

05:52:27.259 --> 05:52:29.595
VACCINE -- EXEMPTION FOR ALL

05:52:29.661 --> 05:52:31.630
VACCINES AND THE IMMUNOLOGIST

05:52:31.697 --> 05:52:33.198
HAD SAID THAT THE NEXT SHOT

05:52:33.265 --> 05:52:34.600
COULD KILL HIM.

05:52:34.666 --> 05:52:36.702
SO AT THIS POINT SB TWO SEVEN

05:52:36.768 --> 05:52:39.304
SEVEN IS FORCING ME TO DECIDE ON

05:52:39.371 --> 05:52:40.772
CHOOSING BETWEEN MY SON'S

05:52:40.839 --> 05:52:43.108
EDUCATION AT AND HIS LIFE AND I

05:52:43.175 --> 05:52:44.843
THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

05:52:44.910 --> 05:52:48.881
NEEDS TO BE.

05:52:48.947 --> 05:52:56.421
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

05:52:56.488 --> 05:52:58.290
WITH US AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE

05:52:58.357 --> 05:53:03.562
EITHER SO -- SO FIRST OF ALL --

05:53:03.629 --> 05:53:04.563
YOU KNOW ITS -- A APPRECIATE THE

05:53:04.630 --> 05:53:06.932
THE PRESENTATION I YOU KNOW I I

05:53:06.999 --> 05:53:07.432
THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

05:53:07.499 --> 05:53:10.802
STATEMENTS THAT -- THAT ARE MADE

05:53:10.869 --> 05:53:12.037
THAT -- DO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS --

05:53:12.104 --> 05:53:13.071
SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE THE

05:53:13.138 --> 05:53:14.072
PRESENTATION -- CERTAINLY I

05:53:14.139 --> 05:53:14.740
THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO GET

05:53:14.806 --> 05:53:16.441
MORE -- INFORMATION ABOUT

05:53:16.508 --> 05:53:18.577
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THIS CASE

05:53:18.644 --> 05:53:20.312
I I DO -- YELLED Là THINGS ARE

05:53:20.379 --> 05:53:21.380
MENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE INSERTS

05:53:21.446 --> 05:53:23.448
SAID SO WE KNOW THAT SINCE RATES

05:53:23.515 --> 05:53:24.850
HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN THERE NOW

05:53:24.917 --> 05:53:26.552
SAYS WHO VACCINES.

05:53:26.618 --> 05:53:27.553
ALL RIGHT SO SAID RATES OF WE

05:53:27.619 --> 05:53:30.923
GOING DOWN WITH INCREASED

05:53:30.989 --> 05:53:32.424
VACCINATION RATES.

05:53:32.491 --> 05:53:33.559
WE TALK ABOUT TOXINS IN THE

05:53:33.625 --> 05:53:34.760
VACCINE -- ACTUALLY THE LOW FOR

05:53:34.826 --> 05:53:36.695
MALAHIDE IN A VACCINE IS -- LESS

05:53:36.762 --> 05:53:38.497
THAN WHAT IN A PAIR THAT YOU

05:53:38.564 --> 05:53:40.465
EACH AND BY THE WAY YOUR BODY

05:53:40.532 --> 05:53:41.967
NORMALLY PRODUCES FORMALDEHYDE

05:53:42.034 --> 05:53:44.503
AS A BY PRODUCT OF METABOLISM --

05:53:44.570 --> 05:53:47.205
THERE ARE NO FETAL CELLS IN

05:53:47.272 --> 05:53:49.942
VACCINES SO THAT'S A ALL RIGHT

05:53:50.008 --> 05:53:50.976
YES PLEASE KEEP.

05:53:51.043 --> 05:53:52.611
PLEASE.

05:53:52.678 --> 05:53:53.512
OKAY SO YOU SOME SO SOME OF THIS

05:53:53.579 --> 05:53:56.415
THE VACCINES ARE DEVELOPED.

05:53:56.481 --> 05:53:57.516
INITIALLY USED IN FUEL CELLS FOR

05:53:57.583 --> 05:53:59.151
DEVELOP VACCINE.

05:53:59.217 --> 05:54:01.219
THOSE ARE CONTINUE CULTURED AND

05:54:01.286 --> 05:54:02.287
AGAIN THEY'RE NOT WHOLE CELLS

05:54:02.354 --> 05:54:04.556
AND VACCINES -- AND THEY'RE

05:54:04.623 --> 05:54:06.625
COMPLETELY WATCH SO -- INSERTS

05:54:06.692 --> 05:54:08.594
BASICALLY IF ANYONE FAMILIAR

05:54:08.660 --> 05:54:10.395
WITH HOW THE FTA WORKS AND

05:54:10.462 --> 05:54:12.364
INSERTS BASICALLY THEIR REPORTS

05:54:12.431 --> 05:54:15.233
OF ANY -- EVENTS NOT NOT

05:54:15.300 --> 05:54:16.234
ASSOCIATE A SAID WITHOUT

05:54:16.301 --> 05:54:18.370
CAUSALITY ANY OF THAT THAT

05:54:18.437 --> 05:54:19.738
HAPPENS DURING.

05:54:19.805 --> 05:54:24.309
CLINICAL EVALUATION SO IF YOU'RE

05:54:24.376 --> 05:54:25.143
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

05:54:25.210 --> 05:54:26.511
AND YOU GET INJURED THAT GOES

05:54:26.578 --> 05:54:27.079
INTO THE INSERTS IF YOU'RE A

05:54:27.145 --> 05:54:28.847
PARTICIPANT IN THE EVALUATION OF

05:54:28.914 --> 05:54:30.382
THAT -- MEDICATION -- INCLUDING

05:54:30.449 --> 05:54:32.985
A VACCINE -- SO THERE ARE A LOT

05:54:33.051 --> 05:54:35.187
OF STATEMENTS IN THERE THAT --

05:54:35.253 --> 05:54:37.189
RAISE SOMEQUESTIONS I CERTAINLY

05:54:37.255 --> 05:54:39.091
WHY IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE

05:54:39.157 --> 05:54:41.927
ABOUT THE EXACTLY WHAT -- WHAT --

05:54:41.994 --> 05:54:43.795
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CHILD BUT

05:54:43.862 --> 05:54:46.565
I I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- IN

05:54:46.632 --> 05:54:48.233
TERMS OF THAT EVALUATION I MEAN

05:54:48.300 --> 05:54:50.902
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS IS THAT --

05:54:50.969 --> 05:54:52.471
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE SCIENCE

05:54:52.537 --> 05:54:53.972
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE

05:54:54.039 --> 05:54:55.707
AND I SAID BEFORE WE GIVE THE

05:54:55.774 --> 05:54:56.875
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

05:54:56.942 --> 05:54:58.443
BASED ON THE SCIENCE AND THE

05:54:58.510 --> 05:55:02.214
EVIDENCE TO THE CHILD SO IF WE

05:55:02.280 --> 05:55:03.281
HAPPEN TO KNOW.

05:55:03.348 --> 05:55:05.183
WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT.

05:55:05.250 --> 05:55:06.585
THERE IS SOME OTHER CAUSE FOR

05:55:06.652 --> 05:55:07.719
THE EVENTS.

05:55:07.786 --> 05:55:09.921
ARE OF WE HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT

05:55:09.988 --> 05:55:11.123
THE VACCINE BECAUSE THERE'S

05:55:11.189 --> 05:55:12.357
EXISTING RESEARCH SHOWS IS NOT

05:55:12.424 --> 05:55:14.192
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WE NEED TO

05:55:14.259 --> 05:55:15.327
ACCEPT THAT.

05:55:15.394 --> 05:55:17.162
IF WE'RE NOT SURE BECAUSE THAT'S

05:55:17.229 --> 05:55:18.363
WHY WE CONTINUE TO RESEARCHERS

05:55:18.430 --> 05:55:20.332
THINGS WE DON'T KNOW THEN YES I

05:55:20.399 --> 05:55:21.199
THINK WE SHOULD -- GIVE SOME

05:55:21.266 --> 05:55:22.701
BENEFIT THE DOUBT IN FACT THAT

05:55:22.768 --> 05:55:25.504
IS -- BY THE WAY HOW WHEN THEY

05:55:25.570 --> 05:55:27.239
SET UP THE GUIDELINES THAT'S

05:55:27.305 --> 05:55:28.940
GENERALLY HOW THEY LOOK AND

05:55:29.007 --> 05:55:30.676
THAT'S HOW EXPECT A REIEW PANEL

05:55:30.742 --> 05:55:32.010
WILL ACT AS WELL.

05:55:32.077 --> 05:55:33.512
I THINK THAT CERTAINLY ONE OF

05:55:33.578 --> 05:55:35.714
THE THINGS THAT -- ONE DO THAT

05:55:35.781 --> 05:55:36.615
IF YOU HAVE YOUR FOLLOWING AN

05:55:36.682 --> 05:55:39.351
IMMUNOLOGIST AT UCSF WHO HAS

05:55:39.418 --> 05:55:42.087
WHAT IS SAYS THAT YOU HAVE A

05:55:42.154 --> 05:55:43.288
RARE IN YOU CAN JUST BUY ALL YOU

05:55:43.355 --> 05:55:43.855
DON'T EVEN NEED AND HAVE A

05:55:43.922 --> 05:55:45.891
DIAGNOSIS IF YOU SAID LOOK.

05:55:45.957 --> 05:55:47.259
I'M AN IMMUNOLOGIST AT UCSF

05:55:47.325 --> 05:55:48.994
HERE'S THE WORK I'VE BEEN DOING

05:55:49.061 --> 05:55:50.295
I FOLLOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH

05:55:50.362 --> 05:55:51.563
THESE IMMUNE CHALLENGES OF STILL

05:55:51.630 --> 05:55:53.098
WORKING IT OFF AND I THINK

05:55:53.165 --> 05:55:53.999
THERE'S A CONCERN BECAUSE I'M

05:55:54.066 --> 05:55:57.803
WORKING UP I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

05:55:57.869 --> 05:55:59.538
WHAT IT IS.

05:55:59.604 --> 05:56:00.405
THAT PERSON SHOULD WILL GET.

05:56:00.472 --> 05:56:01.740
A MEDICAL EXEMPTION I MEAN THAT

05:56:01.807 --> 05:56:03.108
THAT IS WHAT A THAT'S WHY WHEN

05:56:03.175 --> 05:56:03.775
WAS THIS IS GET TOGETHER WE SAY

05:56:03.842 --> 05:56:05.877
OKAY WELL LET'S WHAT ARE WE

05:56:05.944 --> 05:56:07.612
GOING WHAT SHOULD WE DO RIGHT --

05:56:07.679 --> 05:56:10.415
IF SOMEONE SAYS THAT -- YOU KNOW

05:56:10.482 --> 05:56:13.719
MY I A CHILD WHO DIED OF SIDS.

05:56:13.785 --> 05:56:15.721
AND I DON'T OF X. NIGHT MIGHT

05:56:15.787 --> 05:56:17.389
FUTURE CHILD NEXT CHILD.

05:56:17.456 --> 05:56:18.824
I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION THERE

05:56:18.890 --> 05:56:20.092
BECAUSE THERE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN

05:56:20.158 --> 05:56:21.193
TO BE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN

05:56:21.259 --> 05:56:23.462
SITS IN VACCINES IN FACT BACKS --

05:56:23.528 --> 05:56:25.263
SITS RATES HAVE FALLEN -- WITH

05:56:25.330 --> 05:56:27.199
ENTRIES VACCINATION ARGUE SAID I

05:56:27.265 --> 05:56:28.967
HAVE A CHILD WITH AUTISM BY THE

05:56:29.034 --> 05:56:30.035
WAY IT'S STUDY HAS BEEN DONE.

05:56:30.102 --> 05:56:31.403
ALREADY BEEN DONE SAYING THAT

05:56:31.470 --> 05:56:33.038
LOOK WE LOOK AT SIBLINGS OF

05:56:33.105 --> 05:56:33.939
CHILDREN THE AUTISM TO SEE

05:56:34.005 --> 05:56:35.741
WHETHER DAY ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE

05:56:35.807 --> 05:56:38.376
A HIGHER RATE OF AUTISM THEN --

05:56:38.443 --> 05:56:40.679
THAT AFTER B. C. VACCINES

05:56:40.746 --> 05:56:41.279
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY WELL

05:56:41.346 --> 05:56:42.514
MAYBE THERE'S A GENETIC

05:56:42.581 --> 05:56:43.882
COMPONENT -- TO AUTISM AND THEY

05:56:43.949 --> 05:56:45.517
HAVE FOUND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE

05:56:45.584 --> 05:56:46.251
AND THEREFORE JUST BEING A

05:56:46.318 --> 05:56:48.386
SIBLING OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM

05:56:48.453 --> 05:56:50.856
CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE A REASON --

05:56:50.922 --> 05:56:51.957
TO GET AN EXEMPTION FOR VACCINE

05:56:52.023 --> 05:56:54.025
OR DEVOID VACCINATION SO IF WE

05:56:54.092 --> 05:56:55.160
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE OF

05:56:55.227 --> 05:56:56.194
SOMEONE'S ON THE STUDY AND THEY

05:56:56.261 --> 05:56:57.929
FOUND THE RESULT WE NEED TO

05:56:57.996 --> 05:56:59.131
ACCEPT IT THE ONLY OF THE

05:56:59.197 --> 05:57:00.532
SCIENCE WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

05:57:00.599 --> 05:57:01.800
IF WE IF IT IF THERE'S A

05:57:01.867 --> 05:57:03.468
QUESTION SURE WE SHOULD GET THE

05:57:03.535 --> 05:57:07.072
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT TO THE

05:57:07.139 --> 05:57:11.309
CHILD.

05:57:11.376 --> 05:57:14.112
CAN I JUST AND I'M SORRY I WENT

05:57:14.179 --> 05:57:16.148
TO WAS RESERVE [inaudible]

05:57:16.214 --> 05:57:18.150
ADD SOMETHING.

05:57:18.216 --> 05:57:19.584
MR SURE IF YOU DON'T MIND BY

05:57:19.651 --> 05:57:20.051
THANK YOU.

05:57:20.118 --> 05:57:21.887
OKAY I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT --

05:57:21.953 --> 05:57:23.488
MY SON'S SETTLEMENT WAS NOT

05:57:23.555 --> 05:57:25.724
BASED ON THE CC PINK BOOK AND IN

05:57:25.791 --> 05:57:26.892
THE FEDERAL VACCINE COURT THEY

05:57:26.958 --> 05:57:28.593
DO NOT CONSIDER THE CDC PINK

05:57:28.660 --> 05:57:29.761
BOOK THEY HAVE A SEPARATE.

05:57:29.828 --> 05:57:31.830
VACCINE INJURY TABLE THAT THEY

05:57:31.897 --> 05:57:34.299
GO BY IN TERMS OF QUALIFYING IN

05:57:34.366 --> 05:57:36.868
AWARDING -- PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD

05:57:36.935 --> 05:57:40.205
VACCINE INJURIES SO THE LIST OF

05:57:40.272 --> 05:57:43.408
OF THE CDC GUIDELINES THAT ARE

05:57:43.475 --> 05:57:45.610
BEING PROPOSED IN SB.

05:57:45.677 --> 05:57:46.411
TWO SEVEN SIX THEY ARE NOT EVEN

05:57:46.478 --> 05:57:47.712
CONSIDERED IN THE COURT OF A

05:57:47.779 --> 05:57:49.214
VACCINE I MEAN THEY'RE NOT EVEN

05:57:49.281 --> 05:57:51.550
CONSIDERED IN VACCINE COURT.

05:57:51.616 --> 05:57:53.585
THOSE ARE NOT THE SYMPTOMS THAT

05:57:53.652 --> 05:57:55.220
THEY GO BY IN ORDER TO AWARD

05:57:55.287 --> 05:57:59.224
PEOPLE -- AND IN TERMS OF SB TWO

05:57:59.291 --> 05:57:59.791
SEVEN SIX IF I WERE TO HAVE

05:57:59.858 --> 05:58:02.460
ANOTHER CHILD MY SON I ME MINE

05:58:02.527 --> 05:58:04.196
MY NEXT CHILD WOULD NOT BE WOULD

05:58:04.262 --> 05:58:07.966
NOT QUALIFY UNDER SB TWO SEVEN

05:58:08.033 --> 05:58:11.002
SIX EITHER.

05:58:11.069 --> 05:58:11.603
SO SHE'S REFERRING TO THE NEXT

05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:13.305
NATIONAL VACCINE -- COMPENSATION

05:58:13.371 --> 05:58:15.607
THERE RIGHT AWAY THAT IS A NO

05:58:15.674 --> 05:58:17.309
FAULT -- SYSTEM THOSE

05:58:17.375 --> 05:58:18.977
ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS IN FACT

05:58:19.044 --> 05:58:20.145
YOU EVEN HEARD.

05:58:20.212 --> 05:58:21.680
SOMEONE TESTIFY WE SHOULD

05:58:21.746 --> 05:58:23.682
ACTUALLY REPEAL THAT -- SO IT'S

05:58:23.748 --> 05:58:24.616
INTERESTING THAT -- THEIR PEOPLE

05:58:24.683 --> 05:58:26.751
WANT IT REPEALED -- I WOULD MAKE

05:58:26.818 --> 05:58:28.520
NOTE THAT -- THAT'S A NO FAULT

05:58:28.587 --> 05:58:30.222
COMPENSATION SYSTEM THERE ARE

05:58:30.288 --> 05:58:32.057
WHAT THEY CALL TABLE INJURIES --

05:58:32.123 --> 05:58:33.525
SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A TABLE

05:58:33.592 --> 05:58:34.893
INJURIES IS THAT IF YOU RECEIVE

05:58:34.960 --> 05:58:35.961
VACCINE AND YOU FAINTING YOU

05:58:36.027 --> 05:58:38.864
FALL YOU GET COMPENSATED FOR

05:58:38.930 --> 05:58:41.032
THAT INJURY RIGHT -- DOESN'T

05:58:41.099 --> 05:58:42.734
MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T SIN GET

05:58:42.801 --> 05:58:43.301
FUTURE VACCINES BECAUSE YOU

05:58:43.368 --> 05:58:44.336
FAINTED WHEN YOU GOT THE VACCINE

05:58:44.402 --> 05:58:46.071
SO THAT THAT THE TABLE INJURIES

05:58:46.137 --> 05:58:47.739
ARE A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF

05:58:47.806 --> 05:58:49.074
THINGS THEN THINGS THAT SHOULD

05:58:49.140 --> 05:58:50.175
LEAD TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS

05:58:50.242 --> 05:58:50.876
BECAUSE SOME OF THE TABLE

05:58:50.942 --> 05:58:51.743
INJURIES.

05:58:51.810 --> 05:58:53.945
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE THINGS

05:58:54.012 --> 05:58:55.113
THAT MIGHT RESULT THAT MIGHT

05:58:55.180 --> 05:58:56.815
BEEN SO SEATED WITH THE VACCINE

05:58:56.882 --> 05:58:59.150
BUT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS IS

05:58:59.217 --> 05:59:00.785
A SITE A FACTOR -- ADVERSE

05:59:00.852 --> 05:59:02.387
EFFECT OF THE VACCINATION SO I

05:59:02.454 --> 05:59:03.855
THINK WE JUST NEED TO BE CLEAR

05:59:03.922 --> 05:59:06.558
ABOUT -- THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT

05:59:06.625 --> 05:59:08.226
THE STANDARDS ARE ARE USED BY

05:59:08.293 --> 05:59:10.662
THE WAY -- MOST OF THE MANY OF

05:59:10.729 --> 05:59:12.597
THE PEOPLE WHO -- RECEIVE

05:59:12.664 --> 05:59:16.635
COMPENSATION IT'S WITHOUT

05:59:16.701 --> 05:59:17.769
CAUSALITY.

05:59:17.836 --> 05:59:18.770
RIGHT AND IN FACT SO IT'S IT'S

05:59:18.837 --> 05:59:19.504
SO YOU CAN GET COMPENSATION

05:59:19.571 --> 05:59:20.105
WITHOUT CAUSALITY YOUR LEGAL

05:59:20.171 --> 05:59:21.806
FEES ARE PAID -- FOR EVEN IF YOU

05:59:21.873 --> 05:59:23.708
LOSE YOUR CASE -- SO IT IS THE

05:59:23.775 --> 05:59:26.011
IDEA IS TO PROVIDE COMPENSATION

05:59:26.077 --> 05:59:29.180
TO PEOPLE WHO -- YEAH MIGHT HAVE

05:59:29.247 --> 05:59:31.883
SUFFERED AS SOME KIND OF DAMAGE.

05:59:31.950 --> 05:59:33.084
AT THAT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE

05:59:33.151 --> 05:59:35.921
ASSOCIATE THE VACCINE BUT EVEN

05:59:35.987 --> 05:59:39.257
IF THERE'S NOT PROVEN.

05:59:39.324 --> 05:59:39.858
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HI YOU

05:59:39.925 --> 05:59:41.326
KNOW.

05:59:41.393 --> 05:59:42.594
DOCTOR PAN AGAIN I VERY MUCH

05:59:42.661 --> 05:59:44.195
APPRECIATE YOUR TENACITY AND YOU

05:59:44.262 --> 05:59:45.530
ARE GOING TO RESPOND TO EVERY

05:59:45.597 --> 05:59:50.068
POINT -- AND I THINK THE REALITY

05:59:50.135 --> 05:59:51.036
IS THAT THIS IS NOT A BLACK AND

05:59:51.102 --> 05:59:53.071
WHITE ISSUE.

05:59:53.138 --> 05:59:56.741
AND AND SCIENCE CHANGES.

05:59:56.808 --> 05:59:58.843
EVERY BASS LINO THAT BETTER THAN

05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:59.878
I DO EVEN.

05:59:59.945 --> 06:00:01.413
YOU YOU LIVE AND BREATHE AND

06:00:01.479 --> 06:00:03.114
WORK THIS.

06:00:03.181 --> 06:00:04.983
SO I'M NOT GONNA.

06:00:05.050 --> 06:00:06.751
SEE MORE ON THAT IT JUST I I

06:00:06.818 --> 06:00:10.322
FEEL THAT THIS IS OVER REACHING

06:00:10.388 --> 06:00:12.123
IF THE INTENT OF THIS TO GO WAS

06:00:12.190 --> 06:00:13.825
TO GO AFTER.

06:00:13.892 --> 06:00:16.461
DOCTORS WHO ARE ERRONEOUSLY

06:00:16.528 --> 06:00:18.430
OFFERING [inaudible]

06:00:18.496 --> 06:00:24.135
EXEMPTIONS -- I I DON'T I THINK

06:00:24.202 --> 06:00:25.971
THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF DOING IT.

06:00:26.037 --> 06:00:27.672
THEN CREATING THIS SITUATION

06:00:27.739 --> 06:00:30.942
THAT WILL FOCUS SO MUCH MONEY ON

06:00:31.009 --> 06:00:32.944
SUCH A SMALL AREA.

06:00:33.011 --> 06:00:34.646
AND I REALLY DO WISH YOU WOULD

06:00:34.713 --> 06:00:36.481
CONSIDER -- MAKING FURTHER

06:00:36.548 --> 06:00:38.283
CHANGES TO THIS BECAUSE I WOULD

06:00:38.350 --> 06:00:40.151
VERY MUCH WANT TO SUPPORT IT BUT

06:00:40.218 --> 06:00:41.720
AS IT STANDS NOW I STILL.

06:00:41.786 --> 06:00:43.989
I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS.

06:00:44.055 --> 06:00:48.593
SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:00:48.660 --> 06:00:50.528
MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU.

06:00:50.595 --> 06:00:53.231
ANYONE ELSE BEFORE.

06:00:53.298 --> 06:00:53.932
FIRST OFF.

06:00:53.999 --> 06:00:56.101
THANK YOU -- TO EVERYONE -- AND

06:00:56.167 --> 06:00:57.302
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE YOU

06:00:57.369 --> 06:00:59.337
PERSONALLY DOCTOR PAN -- I

06:00:59.404 --> 06:01:00.705
SHOULDN'T I SHOULD INTERVENE

06:01:00.772 --> 06:01:01.906
WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO

06:01:01.973 --> 06:01:03.141
PERSONALLY ATTACK YOU AND I

06:01:03.208 --> 06:01:04.609
DIDN'T UNTIL LATER AND I

06:01:04.676 --> 06:01:06.211
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I THINK

06:01:06.277 --> 06:01:07.345
THAT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

06:01:07.412 --> 06:01:08.580
YOU DON'T LIKE OUR BILL THAT'S

06:01:08.646 --> 06:01:09.814
ONE THING BUT YOU DO NOT ATTACK

06:01:09.881 --> 06:01:11.416
THE PERSON CERTAINLY NOT IN OUR

06:01:11.483 --> 06:01:12.717
HOUSE I DON'T FIND THAT

06:01:12.784 --> 06:01:13.985
APPROPRIATE AND I APOLOGIZE YOU

06:01:14.052 --> 06:01:16.121
PERSONALLY FOR THAT -- I DON'T

06:01:16.187 --> 06:01:18.023
FIND THAT ACCEPTABLE ANYWHERE --

06:01:18.089 --> 06:01:19.824
IN OUR BUSINESS.

06:01:19.891 --> 06:01:20.925
I WANT TO I WANT TO HIT ON A

06:01:20.992 --> 06:01:22.327
VARIETY OF THINGS HERE AND I

06:01:22.394 --> 06:01:23.161
KNOW THERE'S A LOT BUT A LOT

06:01:23.228 --> 06:01:24.329
SAID IN -- THE PATIENCE IS

06:01:24.396 --> 06:01:25.930
RUNNING THIN AND PEOPLE HAVE

06:01:25.997 --> 06:01:28.166
BEEN HERE A LONG TIME -- BUT I

06:01:28.233 --> 06:01:29.100
WANNA I WANNA I WANNA HAVE A

06:01:29.167 --> 06:01:30.068
COUPLE THINGS AND THE REASON I

06:01:30.135 --> 06:01:31.636
ASK IS THE MEDICAL BOARD TO STAY

06:01:31.703 --> 06:01:34.205
HERE HAVE A QUESTION -- OF OF

06:01:34.272 --> 06:01:35.673
THE MEDICAL BOARD.

06:01:35.740 --> 06:01:37.475
AND THAT IS OF THE CASES THAT

06:01:37.542 --> 06:01:39.744
ARE BEING AND INVESTIGATED OR

06:01:39.811 --> 06:01:41.413
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED HOW MANY

06:01:41.479 --> 06:01:43.815
OF THOSE CASES WERE SUCH THAT.

06:01:43.882 --> 06:01:45.550
THAT EXEMPTIONS WERE PROVIDED

06:01:45.617 --> 06:01:48.620
WITH OUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE

06:01:48.686 --> 06:01:50.088
PATIENT.

06:01:50.155 --> 06:01:51.623
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

06:01:51.689 --> 06:01:53.191
WITH ME WITHOUT TAKE A MANUAL

06:01:53.258 --> 06:01:55.293
LOOK THROUGH THE INVESTIGATIONS

06:01:55.360 --> 06:01:57.729
TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT BACK OUR

06:01:57.796 --> 06:01:59.497
SECOND SAID ALRIGHT.

06:01:59.564 --> 06:02:00.532
AND YET MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE

06:02:00.598 --> 06:02:01.132
THOUGHT OF THAT -- SO BUT IS

06:02:01.199 --> 06:02:02.801
THAT IS THAT PART OF WHAT'S

06:02:02.867 --> 06:02:04.069
GOING ON IN IN SOME OF THE ON

06:02:04.135 --> 06:02:05.503
GOING INVESTIGATIONS WHERE

06:02:05.570 --> 06:02:06.438
PEOPLE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN

06:02:06.504 --> 06:02:08.440
EXAMINED THAT MAYBE IT'S A

06:02:08.506 --> 06:02:09.874
TELEPHONE CONSOLE TO WORK.

06:02:09.941 --> 06:02:11.209
OR EVEN LESS THAN THAT I MEAN I

06:02:11.276 --> 06:02:12.911
THINK I AM GENERALLY SPEAKING AS

06:02:12.977 --> 06:02:14.646
INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL

06:02:14.712 --> 06:02:17.415
BUT IN SOME CASES AND YES THE

06:02:17.482 --> 06:02:19.484
THE APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW EXAM

06:02:19.551 --> 06:02:21.986
HAS NOT HAPPENED BUT THAT'S IN

06:02:22.053 --> 06:02:23.688
THE THIS CASE IS IN.

06:02:23.755 --> 06:02:24.255
ANOTHER CASES LIKE OPIOID

06:02:24.322 --> 06:02:25.723
PRESCRIBING CASES AND THINGS

06:02:25.790 --> 06:02:26.891
LIKE THAT BUT YEAH I BELIEVE

06:02:26.958 --> 06:02:28.827
THAT IN THESE CASES THAT IS ONE

06:02:28.893 --> 06:02:30.562
OF THE FACTORS BUT LIKE I SAID

06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:31.830
TO ACTUALLY GET NUMBERS OUT HAVE

06:02:31.896 --> 06:02:33.832
UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THE

06:02:33.898 --> 06:02:36.868
CONFIDENTIALITY ABOUT SO -- WELL

06:02:36.935 --> 06:02:39.003
TODAY OBVIOUSLY THE A LOT OF

06:02:39.070 --> 06:02:41.439
TALK IS AROUND MEASLES -- AND

06:02:41.506 --> 06:02:45.243
AND THE MMR -- IN PARTICULAR --

06:02:45.310 --> 06:02:51.850
I HAVE CONCERNS -- AND A PRODUCT

06:02:51.916 --> 06:02:54.052
FROM A BROADER PERSPECTIVE -- I

06:02:54.119 --> 06:02:56.054
THINK OF FOR EXAMPLE -- WHEN I

06:02:56.121 --> 06:02:57.155
PRACTICED DENTISTRY -- SEEN

06:02:57.222 --> 06:02:58.189
PATIENTS WHO HAD -- ADULT

06:02:58.256 --> 06:02:59.824
PATIENTS OLDER ADULT PATIENTS

06:02:59.891 --> 06:03:02.627
WHO HAD POST POLIO SYNDROME --

06:03:02.694 --> 06:03:03.962
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT SURVIVED

06:03:04.028 --> 06:03:07.165
POLIO -- HAD COMPROMISED LIVES

06:03:07.232 --> 06:03:08.266
AND AS THEY GOT OLDER THEY

06:03:08.333 --> 06:03:09.868
EXPERIENCED WASTING OF THE

06:03:09.934 --> 06:03:11.636
MUSCLES IN ABILITY TO FUNCTION

06:03:11.703 --> 06:03:13.371
WELL THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WAS

06:03:13.438 --> 06:03:14.973
PRETTY AWFUL.

06:03:15.039 --> 06:03:16.508
NOW MOST THE PEOPLE IN THE

06:03:16.574 --> 06:03:17.809
AUDIENCE PROBABLY.

06:03:17.876 --> 06:03:19.511
DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT POLIO

06:03:19.577 --> 06:03:19.811
[inaudible]

06:03:19.878 --> 06:03:23.515
BUT IT IS A IT IS A SERIOUSLY

06:03:23.581 --> 06:03:25.450
DEBILITATING DISEASE WHAT PEOPLE

06:03:25.517 --> 06:03:27.485
DIED IMPRINT WITH POLIO.

06:03:27.552 --> 06:03:29.287
AND AND WE HAVE NEARLY

06:03:29.354 --> 06:03:30.989
ERADICATED POLIO FROM THE PLANET

06:03:31.055 --> 06:03:32.390
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE

06:03:32.457 --> 06:03:33.558
COUNTRIES.

06:03:33.625 --> 06:03:36.294
YET I FEAR THAT WILL GO

06:03:36.361 --> 06:03:38.530
BACKWARDS THAT WILL BRING POLIO

06:03:38.596 --> 06:03:40.865
BACK. TO TO TO TO THE U. S..

06:03:40.932 --> 06:03:42.400
AND I AND THAT THAT THAT THAT

06:03:42.467 --> 06:03:44.702
CONCERNS ME ALSO CONCERNS ME IN

06:03:44.769 --> 06:03:48.540
TALKING -- TO TALKING TO THE

06:03:48.606 --> 06:03:50.875
MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL RECENTLY.

06:03:50.942 --> 06:03:53.778
WHEN A I'M A MOTHER MIGHT TAKE A

06:03:53.845 --> 06:03:56.648
CHILD TO A -- TO A GROCERY STORE

06:03:56.714 --> 06:03:58.316
AN INFANT.

06:03:58.383 --> 06:03:59.951
MAYBE ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS OLD

06:04:00.018 --> 06:04:01.653
MAYBE YOU KNOW I'D.

06:04:01.719 --> 06:04:03.121
PURSUANT TAKEN AND FAN OUT THAT

06:04:03.188 --> 06:04:05.957
YOUNG BUT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT.

06:04:06.024 --> 06:04:06.758
AND THERE COULD BE PEOPLE THAT

06:04:06.824 --> 06:04:08.626
ARE ON IN YOUR ON IMMUNIZED WHO

06:04:08.693 --> 06:04:10.395
MAY HAVE PER TOSSES.

06:04:10.461 --> 06:04:11.763
THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THAT

06:04:11.829 --> 06:04:13.831
INFANT WHO CAN'T BE IMMUNIZED AT

06:04:13.898 --> 06:04:15.833
FIFTEEN DAYS OR WHATEVER.

06:04:15.900 --> 06:04:18.269
IS VERY VERY SERIOUS.

06:04:18.336 --> 06:04:20.605
AND SO WE ALSO TALK ABOUT I'VE

06:04:20.672 --> 06:04:22.106
HEARD PEOPLE SAY I HAD MEASLES

06:04:22.173 --> 06:04:23.608
AND YOU KNOW I'M FINE AND I HAD

06:04:23.675 --> 06:04:25.476
MONTHS I'M FINE.

06:04:25.543 --> 06:04:26.844
BUT IT IS A SERIOUS.

06:04:26.911 --> 06:04:27.946
ILLNESS.

06:04:28.012 --> 06:04:29.180
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER

06:04:29.247 --> 06:04:30.782
YEARS DOWN THE LINE WITH

06:04:30.848 --> 06:04:33.251
COMPLICATIONS LIGHT HEARING LOSS --

06:04:33.318 --> 06:04:35.153
LIKE VISION LOSS OR LIKE SOME

06:04:35.220 --> 06:04:37.322
OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED YEARS

06:04:37.388 --> 06:04:38.790
AFTER THEY HAVE HAD THE MEASLES

06:04:38.856 --> 06:04:40.491
AND IT CAN BE TRCED BACK TO

06:04:40.558 --> 06:04:41.192
HAVING HAD THE MEASLES.

06:04:41.259 --> 06:04:42.894
SO SO TO PUT COULD THIS IS AS A

06:04:42.961 --> 06:04:46.264
INNOCENT CONDITION OF CHILDHOOD

06:04:46.331 --> 06:04:47.899
IS I THINK IS IS MISTAKEN.

06:04:47.966 --> 06:04:49.133
ASK THE THAT'S THE YOUNG CHILD

06:04:49.200 --> 06:04:51.102
WHO SPENT FIVE FOR FIVE DAYS AND

06:04:51.169 --> 06:04:54.172
I SEE YOU AND IN OREGON -- WITH

06:04:54.239 --> 06:04:55.640
COMPLICATIONS FROM THE MEASLES

06:04:55.707 --> 06:04:59.711
HOUSE IN SERIOUS THAT IS -- AND

06:04:59.777 --> 06:05:01.246
AND SO IT IS IT IS HERE IS RIGHT

06:05:01.312 --> 06:05:03.414
AND I DO SO I DO TAKE YEAH I DO

06:05:03.481 --> 06:05:04.382
TAKE UMBRAGE WITH PEOPLE DO KIND

06:05:04.449 --> 06:05:05.917
OF POOH POOHED THIS AS AS NOT

06:05:05.984 --> 06:05:08.419
BEING SERIOUS.

06:05:08.486 --> 06:05:09.887
I THINK THE CRITICAL THING I'VE

06:05:09.954 --> 06:05:12.523
HEARD ALSO THAT -- WELL YOU KNOW

06:05:12.590 --> 06:05:14.559
WE GOT 95% YOU KNOW IMMUNITY

06:05:14.626 --> 06:05:16.094
THEREFORE IT'S ALL GOOD IT

06:05:16.160 --> 06:05:17.662
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY IT'S

06:05:17.729 --> 06:05:19.964
REGIONAL IT'S BY SCHOOL IS BY

06:05:20.031 --> 06:05:21.165
YOUR COMMUNITY IT'S BY YOUR

06:05:21.232 --> 06:05:22.900
CHURCHES BY YOUR PLAYGROUP IT'S

06:05:22.967 --> 06:05:24.602
A VARIETY OF THINGS.

06:05:24.669 --> 06:05:25.670
AND WHEN I THINK OF LISTENING

06:05:25.737 --> 06:05:27.538
LISTENING TO LACI WAS NOT IN

06:05:27.605 --> 06:05:29.540
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SHE'S

06:05:29.607 --> 06:05:30.174
JUST CONCERNED ABOUT AN

06:05:30.241 --> 06:05:32.844
EXEMPTION THAT WOULD PROTECT HER.

06:05:32.910 --> 06:05:34.045
BECAUSE IF THERE ARE MORE AND

06:05:34.112 --> 06:05:35.513
MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

06:05:35.580 --> 06:05:37.782
IMMUNIZED.

06:05:37.849 --> 06:05:38.983
SHE'S AT RISK.

06:05:39.050 --> 06:05:40.485
HER BECAUSE HER CHILDREN COULD

06:05:40.551 --> 06:05:42.053
CONTRACT THE DISEASE BECAUSE

06:05:42.120 --> 06:05:43.955
WE'VE ARMY AS ASCERTAIN THEIR

06:05:44.022 --> 06:05:45.123
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T GET THE EXIT

06:05:45.189 --> 06:05:46.157
COULD SHOULD GET THESE.

06:05:46.224 --> 06:05:47.792
SO.

06:05:47.859 --> 06:05:49.560
THE END OF IT THE THE INABILITY

06:05:49.627 --> 06:05:51.863
FOR PEOPLE THE OR THE THE DESIRE

06:05:51.929 --> 06:05:52.830
PEOPLE TO NOT IMMUNIZE OUR

06:05:52.897 --> 06:05:55.900
CHILDREN PUTS OTHER KIDS AT RISK

06:05:55.967 --> 06:05:57.235
WITH LACI AT RISK.

06:05:57.302 --> 06:05:58.336
AND SO THAT'S A SERIOUS THAT'S A

06:05:58.403 --> 06:06:00.405
SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT I

06:06:00.471 --> 06:06:01.539
HAPPENINGS.

06:06:01.606 --> 06:06:06.077
IT'S MY TURN THANK YOU -- I HAVE

06:06:06.144 --> 06:06:08.680
A AYE DATA HERE -- AND THAT SAYS

06:06:08.746 --> 06:06:10.948
THAT WE HAVE -- FIFTEEN MEMBERS

06:06:11.015 --> 06:06:12.884
OF THIS COMMITTEE.

06:06:12.950 --> 06:06:14.852
WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND NINETY

06:06:14.919 --> 06:06:15.653
FIVE SCHOOLS AMONG THE FIFTEEN

06:06:15.720 --> 06:06:18.022
MEMBERS THAT IMMUNIZATION RATES

06:06:18.089 --> 06:06:19.590
LESS THAN 95%.

06:06:19.657 --> 06:06:20.325
A HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE

06:06:20.391 --> 06:06:22.527
SCHOOLS FIFTEEN MEMBERS THAT'S

06:06:22.593 --> 06:06:23.528
ABOUT.

06:06:23.594 --> 06:06:24.829
TEN PER MEMBER ROUGHLY.

06:06:24.896 --> 06:06:26.664
WE GOT ONE MEMBER WHO HAS ONE

06:06:26.731 --> 06:06:27.865
SCHOOL.

06:06:27.932 --> 06:06:30.535
WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER BEST.

06:06:30.601 --> 06:06:31.502
THIRTY TWO THIS IS CLEARLY NOT

06:06:31.569 --> 06:06:32.770
DISPERSED EVENLY ACROSS THE

06:06:32.837 --> 06:06:34.472
POPULATION.

06:06:34.539 --> 06:06:36.674
THIS IS REGIONAL THIS IS LOCAL

06:06:36.741 --> 06:06:37.508
AND THIS IS THIS THIS IS A

06:06:37.575 --> 06:06:38.910
CHALLENGE WHAT'S MORE DISTURBING

06:06:38.976 --> 06:06:41.012
TO ME.

06:06:41.079 --> 06:06:41.746
IS THAT WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN

06:06:41.813 --> 06:06:42.647
SCHOOLS.

06:06:42.714 --> 06:06:43.915
THEY HAVE REPORTED AT ALL EVEN

06:06:43.981 --> 06:06:45.116
THOUGH IT'S REQUIRED.

06:06:45.183 --> 06:06:47.051
MATTER FACT THAT NUMBER MAY

06:06:47.118 --> 06:06:48.686
APPROACH A THOUSAND THERE MAY BE

06:06:48.753 --> 06:06:49.987
A THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA

06:06:50.054 --> 06:06:51.189
THAT ARE NOT REPORTING THE

06:06:51.255 --> 06:06:52.490
IMMUNIZATION.

06:06:52.557 --> 06:06:54.625
THE PROBLEM COULD BE BIGGER THAN

06:06:54.692 --> 06:06:55.793
WE ACTUALLY KNOW.

06:06:55.860 --> 06:06:57.595
AND THAT AND THAT THAT TROUBLES

06:06:57.662 --> 06:06:59.564
THAT TROUBLES ME AS WELL.

06:06:59.630 --> 06:07:01.666
SO -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT SAID

06:07:01.733 --> 06:07:03.101
HERE TODAY THERE'S BEEN A

06:07:03.167 --> 06:07:04.702
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON

AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

06:07:11.309 --> 06:07:12.377
BILL AND THINKING ABOUT THIS

06:07:12.443 --> 06:07:14.078
BILL SINCE IT WAS HEARD IN THE

06:07:14.145 --> 06:07:15.780

06:07:21.619 --> 06:07:23.321
THAT WE ARE AT A PLACE THAT THIS

06:07:23.388 --> 06:07:25.790
IS THIS THROUGH THE OUR PROCESS

06:07:25.857 --> 06:07:27.692
IS A IS A BETTER BILL I STILL

06:07:27.759 --> 06:07:29.127

06:07:31.963 --> 06:07:33.030
CAN THERE BE A WAY TO ADDRESS

06:07:33.097 --> 06:07:34.799
HER CONCERN AS WE MOVE FORWARD

06:07:34.866 --> 06:07:36.300
AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU.

06:07:36.367 --> 06:07:37.168
