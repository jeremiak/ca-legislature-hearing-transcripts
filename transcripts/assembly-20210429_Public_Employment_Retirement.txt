THE WAR FINALLY CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT BARRIER TO HEALING. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO STILL OPPOSED THE MANDATORY ANNUAL EVALUATION LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN THE BILL'S CURRENT FORM. AS WE FEEL IT WILL LIKELY LEAD TO PERCEPTIONS THAT INFORMATION COULD IMPACT OFFICERS CAREERS AND BACKTRACKED ON SOME OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. REGARDING THE WILLINGNESS OF OFFICERS TO SEEK HELP. WE DO HOWEVER UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT INTENTION- AND APPRECIATE HIS COMMENT THAT MADE DURING HIS OPENING STATEMENT.

THAT COMMAND AGAIN. ONE SEVEN ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO COMMENTS COMING THROUGH AT THE TIME. THANK YOU OPERATOR. OKAY I'M- WE GOT A BILL MOVED INTO SECOND MEDICALLY. THANK YOU. THE BILL FOR. AND- PRINT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH PEOPLE- I APPRECIATE THANK YOU THANK REFER JOHNSON BRING THIS BILL FOR THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH A CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS IMAGES TAKEN I WANNA SAY I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND I ACTUALLY AM GRATIFIED TO HEAR THIS SORT OF ALIGNS AS MR EASILY SEVERAL. INITIATIVES ALREADY UNDERWAY WITH PEACE OFFICERS. ARE WITH CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. I THINK THAT THIS ISSUE OF. MENTAL HEALTH IS SUCH A TERRIBLE TITLE TO HANG ON THINGS. ARE AND SO I HOPE THE OPPONENTS ARE LISTEN THE FOLKS ARE TALKING YOU'RE LISTENING I PERSONALLY THINK THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THE FACT THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE OFFICER OUT OF THE PRISON. AND THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU TAKE THE PRESIDEN OF THE OFFICER. THEY NEED TO GO HOME THEY NEED TO BE HUSBANDS THEY NEED TO BE. THAT'S ARE THEY HAVE FRIENDS THAT THEY ASSOCIATE WITH. THEY ARE MODELS OF A CAREER WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT N CALIFORNIA AND SAW HOW THEY THEIR ABILITY CANNOT LEAVE THE PRISON AND LEAVE THE PRESENT BEHIND AS THEY HEAD HOME IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR PRISONS AND RECRUIT THE TRACK PEOPLE. SO I JUST THINK THIS IS A IT MAY BE A DIFFICULT TOPIC BUT ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S ONE THAT. WE OUGHT TO BE BACKING THEM UP IN THIS CONVERSATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. I THINK THE WORK THEY PERFORM IS VERY DIFFICULT. ARM AND HONESTLY I THINK FRAME THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT. CAN YOU. WHEN YOU TAKE THE PRESENTS THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER OUT OF THE PRISON CAN YOU TAKE THE PRESIDING OFFICER WHEN THEY GO HOME. I THINK MOST CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE. AND NOT. FOR THEIR FAILINGS. BUT JUST LIKE THEY'RE DOING IS VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC WORK AND THE STRESSES AND STRAINS OF WHAT THEY DEAL WITH ON THE JOB. COULD EASILY FOLLOW THEM HOME. AND COMPLICATE THEIR PERSONAL LIVES AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOUR HUSBANDS FATHER'S- OF. WIVES THEY HAVE THESE OTHER OBLIGATIONS SO. I REALLY FEEL THIS IS AN ASPECT OF TRYING TO HAVE THE BACK. OF OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. IT IS TO NOT LEAVE THEM ALONE WITH THE STRESSES AND STRAINS OF THEIR JOB. IS TO TRY TO COME IN AND PROVIDE A WAY OF SUPPORT. ANNA I SEEM TO QUOTE THIS OFTEN BUT I REMEMBER. A SERMON I ONCE HEARD WHEN I WAS. SEVENTEEN AND THE SERVER WAS ON THE SEVEN LAST WORDS OF THE CHURCH. AS ACCESS INTERESTING TOPIC WHAT THE HECK WOULD BE THE SEVEN LAST WORDS OF THE CHURCH THE SEVEN LAST WORDS BEFORE THE TRUTH BECAME IRRELEVANT. TURNED OUT THE SEVEN LAST WORDS WERE WE'VE NEVER TRIED IT THAT WAY BEFORE. SO I SORT OF THINK THE WAY WE KEEP AHEAD OF ISSUES AS WE DO TRY DO IDEAS WE LOOK AT NEW IDEAS. I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AND I THINK IT'S AS GOOD AS FOLLOWS. HOW DO WE HELP OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS LEAVE THE WORK BEHIND WHEN THEY CALL HOME- AND- FULFILL ALL THEIR ROLES WITHOUT DRAGGING THAT AROUND. SO I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE YOU BRING FORTH THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND I JUST. COMMEND YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION REMARKED UPON WITH THE CCPO AND THEIR TRUST FUND AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.

WILL BE AB ONE ZERO FIVE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN MEMBERS OF THE BILL WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU TO SHARE OUR BROUGHT MY GOOD LUCK HERE THAT'S AMAZING TENNIS HOLDEN. GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHATEVER IT REGULATORY. MISTER MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB ONE OH FIVE A BILL THAT IDENTIFIES AND REFORMS PROCESSES THAT HINDER UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. MEMBERS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THE SACRAMENTO BEE HAS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF LETTERS WRITTEN ON BEHALF OF AFRICAN AMERICAN EMPLOYEES WORKING AT ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR FOR AIR RESOURCES BOARD. ARE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM. AND THE OFFICE OF STATE PUBLISHING ALL OF THESE INSTANCES HAVE A COMMON DENOMINATOR THERE ARE BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND INCLUSION. LAST YEAR GOVERNORNEWSOM TOOK A BOLD STEP FORWARD BY SIGNING MY BILL AB NINE SEVEN NINE WHICH IT REQUIRES EACH PUB PUBLICLY HELD. CORPORATION WHOSE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF DIRECTORS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ON ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE GOAL IS PLAIN AND SIMPLE WE NEED TO INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS WAS A PRAISE WORTHY STEP FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HOWEVER THERE ARE PERPETUAL BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY THAT EXIST IN PUBLIC SECTOR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. IT IS IN THE SPIRIT. THAT I PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN AB ONE OH FIVE. FOR STARTERS AB ONE OH FIVE CALLS FOR DIVERSITY IN ALL STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERS. AS YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ALLOW PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON RACE GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION AND CONTRACTING. THEREFORE THE LEGISLATURE CAN NOT REQUIRED DIVERSITY. REGARDING BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THAT ARE SOLELY COMPRISED OF STATE EMPLOYEES HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOWED TO REQUIRE DIVERSITY ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WERE THE BOARD MEMBER OR COMMISSIONER IS A VOLUNTEER. AB ONE OH FIVE SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY THE POSITIONS OF VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONERS AS VACANCIES OCCUR. FURTHER THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES MAY DEVELOP MODEL UPWARD MOBILITY GOALS TO INCLUDE RACE GENDER AND LGBT Q. AS FACTORS TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL EQUAL PROTECTION LAWS. THE INCLUSION OF THESE FACTORS ARE SIMPLY MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY. I'M AWARE OF THE PROVISIONS OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND WANT TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. COLLEAGUES OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THE CAL H. R. WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND CENSUS REPORT. INDICATES CONSISTENTLY THAT OVER 60% OF THOSE IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ARE WHITE MALE AND FEMALE. WELL THE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR THIS GROUP HAS HOVERED AROUND THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM 60% OF THOSE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES MAKING FORTY THOUSAND OR LESS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THESE ARE THE SAME MANAGERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVERTISING RECRUITING AND HIRING CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPLICIT BIAS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THEREFORE AB ONE OH FIVE REQUIRES THAT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ESTABLISH A PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DIVERSITY AND BEST PRACTICES IN EACH ASPECT OF THE DESIGN ANNOUNCEMENT ADMINISTRATION OF EXAM EXAMINATIONS FOR THE STAB US MET OF EMPLOYMENT LISTS. A DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIRING PROCESS PROVIDES FOR A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND BETTER OUTCOMES. FINALLY AB ONE OH FIVE REQUIRES THAT CALLIE CHAR SUBMIT WITHIN ITS ANNUAL WORKFORCE ANALYSIS A CONSENSUS REPORT. ALL OF THE ADVERSE ACTIONS TAKEN BY DEPARTMENTS AGAINST EMPLOYEES. IT CALLS FOR THE REPORT TO INCLUDE THE TYPE OF ADVERSE ACTION ETHNICITY GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION IF AVAILABLE. THE GOAL IS TO SEE IF THERE ARE PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE DEPARTMENTS. CLOSE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CONSULTANT. AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED TO APPROPRIATIONS SUCH AS SHIFTING COMPLIANCE FROM S. B. B. TO CALAIS CHAR. AND THE ASSISTANCE OF COLLEGE ARE WITH THE PARCHMENTS THAT FAIL TO MEET UPWARD MOBILITY GOALS. AFTER A RECENT MEETING WITH ADMINISTRATION OUR OFFICE HAS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF S. S. P. B. THANK COLLEGE ARE AND WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

THERE ARE TWO. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES WILL PLACE AN ON CALL. K. E. BILLS LOCAL MR HOLDEN THANK YOU. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS TO MY NEXT COMMITTED. THE REQUESTED. FOR AND WHAT WHAT UP FOR THE RECORD THAT MR IS THAT IS- EVERCORE SILVA THERE BILL I. AB EIGHT NINETY OF THIS CERVANTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY TODAY HI THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND PROMOTE THE INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITY MONEY MANAGERS IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE UTILIZATION OF EMERGING AND DIVERSE MONEY MANAGERS. CALPERS AND CAL STIRS HAVE A COMBINED ASSET OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION BUT A RELATIVELY LOW RATE OF PARTICIPATION OF EMERGING AND DIVERSE MANAGERS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER STATE PENSION SYSTEMS. IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FEW THINGS ARE MORE DETERMINATIVE OF YOUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THE ABILITY. OF AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. BUT THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. PARTICULARLY ACCESS IN THE CAPITAL OUR COMPANIES NEED TO FLOURISH AND GROW IS DIFFICULT. IT IS CLEAR THAT SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES EXIST AND HOW THE SYSTEM SELECT MANAGERS TO INVEST THE CAPITAL THAT THEY OVERSEE. DUE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THE FIRMS THAT ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATION ARE WOMEN AND MINORITY FIRMS. THE CYCLE FOR PERJURY PERPETUATES THE HISTORIC NEGLECT AND A LACK OF RESOURCES FOR HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT HAVE A SURE SUCCESS WITHOUT SHARED OPPORTUNITY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESSES SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO ACTORS NEED ACCURATE INFORMATION ON HOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. DISBURSAL CAPITAL TO WOMEN AND MINORITY MANAGERS WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY IS SELANDER BROKE CEO THE NEW AMERICAN ALLIANCE WHO'S A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR NEXT MOVES TO PROMISES SUPPORT US MISS BROOKS. I THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TO LAUNCH FERNANDES BROOKS AND I'M THE CEO OF THE NEW AMERICA ALLIANCE OR AN EIGHT THE ANY IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION OF LATINO BUSINESS LEADERS DEDICATED TO ADVANCING THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITY OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED FIRMS AND TO PROMOTE DIVERSE LEADERSHIP AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP CORPORATE AMERICA AND PUBLIC SERVICE. THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY THAT CAN BILL BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY WEALTH THROUGH FORCING BUSINESSES AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT STAGNATES THAT WE HAD HIGHER LEVELS. OF POVERTY AND THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY. ENABLE THE THIS AB EIGHT. IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL. AN ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVING CALPERS AND CAL STIRS REPORT ON HOW THEY DEPLOY THEIR INVESTMENT ASETS WHICH WAS MENTIONED IN APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION COMBINED. TRANSPARENCY IS THE FIRST STEP PRIOR TO AN AA. TEN OF MY FIFTEEN YEARS OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITHIN THE CHARACTERS INVESTMENT BRANCH WE SPEND REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER. I HELPED CREATE AND LED AND MANAGE TO FIND INVESTMENTS WITH WOMEN AND MINORITY MANAGERS THE LAST FIVE YEARS I MANAGED A GLOBAL PORTFOLIO. OF MEN AND WOMEN WORKING IN THE PENSION PLANS ARE GOOD INTELLIGENT PEOPLE AND THEY DO THEIR VERY BEST. TO DO. THE WORK THE VERY. BEST THEY CAN HOWEVER. THEY WORK IN A CULTURE WHERE LARGE INVESTMENT FIRMS ARE FAVORED. AND IN INVESTMENTS THE LARGE INVESTMENT FIRMS ARE TRADITIONALLY MALE AND WHITE. AND IT MADE ME BELIEVE THAT IT IS A TO DO SHE EVERY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE ALL OPPORTUNITIES ARE VETTED TO ENABLE THE SELECTION OF THE BEST INVESTMENT FIRM FOR THIS STRATEGY CAN GENERATE THE BEST RETURN PRETENSIONERS. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE ALMOST 70% OF THE POPULATION IN ACCORDING TO A TWO TWENTY NINETEEN NIGHT COMBINATION STUDY. ONLY ONE POINT 3% OF THE SIXTY NINE TRILLION ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY IS MANAGED BY WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED FIRMS. THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF ASKING CALPERS OUR CULTURES TO ENTRUST THEIR ATHLETES WITH LOW PERFORMING MANAGERS BUT IT IS ABOUT ASKING THEM TO IDENTIFY PUBLIC FUNDS ARE MANAGED AND INVESTED WITH HIGH PERFORMING WOMEN AND MINORITIES BANISTERS. IT IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. ULTIMATELY MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THIS ISSUE REQUIRES ACTIVE LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT THIS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT DATA YOU'LL NEED TO ACCURATELY ASSESS HOW THE FUNDS ARE. PERFORMING ON DIVERSITY. SIMPLE BUT CREWS FIRST. THANK AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU OUR NEXT PRIMARY WITNESSES SUPPORT IS JIM PARK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JIM PARK CEO OF SUFFICIENT REASON AMERICAN INVESTMENT MANAGERS ALSO KNOWN AS ANY WE ARE NINETY INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLYWOMAN CERVANTES. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL REINSTATE AND ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS DEPLOY THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT ASSETS THAT OUR COUNTRY BOTH FROM THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING PANDEMIC. AND THE SOCIAL INJUSTICE WE WITNESSED LAST YEAR ENDED SURE CONDUCT INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO EMPOWER DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND CREATE EXPANDEDECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE WE BELIEVE AB EIGHT NINETY THERE'S A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCKS TO CREATING A MORE EQUITABLE ECONOMIC SOCIETY FOR EVERYONE. FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND SETS INTO THE NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OF ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN THE FIELD OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS WE HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE POWER OF DIVERSITY IN THE WORK WE DO WEDDING AND THE NORMA'S BENEFIT INCLUDES THE POLICIES CREEK FOR INVESTMENT INDUSTRY AT LARGE. SINCE SINCE YEAR TWO THOUSAND ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS IN THE U. S. HAS GROWN FASTER THAN ANY OTHER POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY CURRENTLY REPRESENTING ABOUT 6% OF THE OVERALL U. S. POPULATION- BUT IT 15% OF CALIFORNIA POPULATION TODAY- THE PERCEPTION THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS ACHIEVED BROUGHT SUCCESS IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR SOCIETY. IS FAR FROM REALITY IN THE FACT THAT OUR COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATION EXPERIENCED HATE CRIMES AND EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN CERTAIN SEGMENTS LAST YOUR NAME RELEASED A STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT LET YOU WHAT HAPPENED MANAGER TERMS WITH MAJORITY ASIAN AMERICAN OWNERSHIP REPRESENT ONLY THREE POINT 5% OF THE INDUSTRY TOTAL. THESE TERMS ARE TYPICALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THE END OF. THE INDUSTRY AVERAGE AND OVERALL ALL. AMERICAN FONG MANAGE JOBS POINTS THAT PERCENT OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. DESPITE THEIR PER. MEETING OR EXCEEDING AND GOT. THIS PERFORMANCE ARE TO WITH THE WE- SALON SINAN. ABOUT THE NIGHT FROM BASE WHICH FILE THAT A- DRAMATIC UNDER REPRESENTS OF. BUT OTHER- FIRM IN INDIA DEAL DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE BONDS DID NOT SEE ANY DROP IN PERFORMANCE WE SUPPORT MORE ALLOCATION TO MORE WOMEN. OR MINORITY OWNED FIRMS TALKING. FOX FARMS DO NOT FIX SIX ARE NOT EXTRA FROM EMERGING PROGRAM THERE IS OFTEN A PUT ON A FALSE PERCEPTION IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY THAT IF YOU GUYS DO NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES. AS A RESULT API OWNED FIRMS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED FOR THESE PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE BURKE SOME FORTY SIX PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS CALPERS MCALLISTER DURING THE LARGEST PARTICIPATING IN THE EMERGING MANAGERS PROGRAM. FOCUSED ON PUBLIC MARKET INVESTMENT BUT ONLY REPRESENTS TWENTY THREE BILLION IN TOTAL ASSET ALLOCATION. HOWEVER THE TOTAL STOCK WOULD BE PROGRAM STILL REPRESENT A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE OVERALL INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TOTAL ASSETS AND OF THE HUNDRED FORTY SIX UNIQUE MANAGERS PARTICIPATING IN THESE EMERGING MANAGERS PROGRAM STRUCK THE- COUNTRY LAST YEAR. AND FOUND THAT ONLY SEVEN ARE SEVEN ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER ALL. BUT LACK OF ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS HINDER OUR COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT CAPITAL FOR WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIA CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THE FULL POWER OF DIVERSITY WITHOUT PROVIDING SHARED OPPORTUNITY AND THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT- WITHOUT THAT JUST CAN'T BE DONE. WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANY RETURNS AB EIGHT NINETY IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING POLICYMAKERS WITH THE DATA THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BILL'S ALLOCATION DECISIONS ARE. ARE ENHANCING THE LIVES OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND TO SUPPORT. THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. THANK YOU NET MOVE ON THE WAY.

EIGHT NINETY PLEASE PRESS ONE SEVEN ZERO. THAT COMMAND AGAIN. ONE ZERO. WE HAVE NO COMMENTS COMING THROUGH AT THE TIME THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE. MR VOEPEL. YES ON A COUPLE COMMENTS I'VE SPENT QUITE A FEW YEARS IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS BILL AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WITH IT TRUST ME I GET IT BUT I'M NOT ANALYTICAL. IN SOME OF THE- PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS BILL. IS THERE IS NO DEFINITION. FOR THE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS REPORTS THERE'S NO GUIDELINES NO DEFINITIONS AND BASICALLY THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN GUIDELINES AND DEFINITIONS AND- THEY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A ONE PAGE REPORT. FOUR HUNDRED PAGE REPORT BASICALLY FROM WHAT I'M READING HERE- ALSO. CALPERS AND CAL STIRS EVEN THOUGH THERE PUBLIC A PUBLIC. INVESTMENT SLASH RETIREMENT FUND. ALL THE INVESTMENT MANAGERS IN MY THIRTY NINE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY. INVESTMENT MANAGERS HAVE THEIR FAVORITE BROKERS THEIR FAVORITE HEDGE FUND GUYS THEIR FAVORITE EVERYTHING SO- PROBABLY THIS BILL WILL NOT GET TO WHERE YOU WANNA GO- AND THEN. LAST WAS WHAT YOU WANT IS INVESTMENT MANAGERS THAT GET YOU THE HIGHEST RATE OF RETURN- AND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY IN THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO SO I JUST WANTED TO THE AUTHOR DID KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR COOLEY. ELEVEN FOR INTERNET OPERATIVE IN MY USED IN THIS BUILDING NINETEEN THERE'S SOME BREAKFAST MEDICAL CARE I'M THE TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I'M THE BILL. AND USED OF. THERE WAS A JOINT LETTER COMMITTEE ON PENSION INVESTMENTS- BY MY BOSS. AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IT PASSED AND SENT TO THE VOTERS AC SIXTY THREE WHICH BECAME PROP TWENTY ONE. WHICH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR HAVING FAILED IN EIGHTY TWO PASSED AND PUT. IN PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT SYSTEM THE FOOD NEXT COURT RULE. WHAT SETS UP THE ROLE OF INVESTORS. AND IT'S SORT OF IRONIC THAT OF. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES TO JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC PENSION FUND INVESTMENTS WHICH AFFECTED A REVOLUTION WHERE PENSION FUNDS OPERATED WAS. ADVISED BY A WOMAN MARCY A RENOVATED FOR ECONOMICS OF WHO WAS THE TOUCHSTONE FOR A LOT OF THEIR POLICIES THAT CAME OUT OF THAT BODY IN FIVE YEARS WAS TWENTY TWO BILLS OF THAT HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR PENSION SYSTEM SO. ON HI I BELIEVE THE EFFECT OF THE PROJECT PER RULE WILL. SUPPORTERS MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT IMPOSES AN OBLIGATION ON THE PRINTER SYSTEMS I ALSO THINK. THEIR FOCUS THIS BILL RATE OF RETURN AND NOT NECESSARILY IN WRITING VOLUMINOUS REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IN REPORTED OUT TO US WE WILL FIND THE SWEET SPOT FOR WHAT THE LAWMAKERS WANT. OF OUR POWER OF OVERSIGHT GOING TO HELP US DO THAT BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION I THINK ARM IS A PRECEPT OF INVESTMENT YOU WANT TO DIVERSIFY YOUR RISKS AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY IN HAVING A BROADER ARRAY OF PERSONALITIES INVOLVED INVESTMENT DECISIONS. ALL THAT IS A FORM OF DIVERSIFICATION IT'S ALLOWS US TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE LOOKING IN THE MARKET TURNING OVER THE ROCKS IT MAKES SENSE TO THEM AND FINDING POTENTIAL VALUE FOR THEIR CALPERS AND CAL STIRS SO I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL OF FINGERPRINT FOR. SO WE WILL FIRST BY MR IS OUR SECOND. SECOND MR O'DONNELL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES LIKE TO CLOSE IN YOUR BILL YES AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS- FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES TO THE LARGEST INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW THESE TWO PENSION FUNDS SET THE STANDARD- OF HOW OTHER INSTITUTIONS INVEST.

A THE CREDIT TO MR BONTA- THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE ACT ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR THE USE OF PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS BY STATE AGENCIES WOULD PRESCRIBE POSITION CONDITIONS ARE MET. THESE THE PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS SHOULD BE C. SPARINGLY WHEN THEY'RE FUNDED FULL TIME POSITIONS NOT BEING FILLED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THOSE VACANCIES ARE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS PHYSICIANS SURGEONS. PSYCHOLOGIST AND DENTIST. WITH PROFESSIONALS A CONTRACTOR CONSISTENTLY SOMETIMES THAT DO BECAUSE WE'RE IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF CARE TO PATIENTS. SB SIX FIVE SEVEN PROVIDE PROTECTIONS AND TRANSPARENCY. TO THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PROFESSIONALS BY PROHIBITING A STATE AGENCY FROM ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT. THE PROFESSIONAL FOR A PERIOD OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS OFF FOR A PERIOD OF THREE SIXTY FIVE KNOCKED AT THE DAYS. INN A TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE DR STUART BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION OF AMERICAN POSITION TO DENNIS STAFF B. TWO OH SIX I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SIX FIFTY SEVEN THIS BILL WHEN SIGNED INTO LAW WILL PER IMPROVE THE HIRING TRUCK PROSPECTS OF STATE DOCTORS DENTISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS- AND PHARMACIST. IT WILL HELP REDUCE THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH BACON C. RATE AND SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS FOR DECADES THE STATE IS CONTRACTED OUT BARGAINING UNIT SIXTEEN VACANCIES TO EXPENSIVE PRIVATE REGISTRIES MEANWHILE OUR CIVIL SERVICE WORKFORCE HAS DWINDLED DOWN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS RELATED TO THE DIVERSION OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. BUT THEY'RE BEING USED TO PAY CONTRACTORS THE RESULT PRINCIPAL SERVICES BEEN MINIMAL SALARY INCREASES MANY MAKE RECRUITING EFFORTS BY THE STATE AND SIGNIFICANT SIGN UP BONUSES SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN IS A STEP TO CORRECT THIS IMBALANCE ALTHOUGH THE STATE CLAIMS THAT THEY PREFERRED CIVIL SERVICE DOCTORS% OVER CONTRACTORS ITS BEHAVIOR INDICATES OTHERWISE. WHETHER NEGOTIATING WITH OUR WITH US FOR OUR AMMO USER MEETING WITH YOU A PD AND ARE CONTRACTING OUT COMMITTEES THERE'S ONLY LISTSERV A STATE TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION BONUSES ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENTS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS ARE ROUTINELY REJECTED. NO WONDER THAT THE CDC ARE PSYCHIATRY VACANCY RATE IS NEARLY 50% OF THE VACANCY RATE AT SOME PSH DISABILITIES YEARS. EMERGENCE POWER UNDER GOV CODE ONE NINE THREE TO. PRIVATE RAY PSYCHOTIC. AT UP TO TWO AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT'S TWICE THE SALARY OF OUR CIVIL SERVICE PSYCHIATRIST AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR ADMINISTRATIVE FEE. SEVERAL OF THESE CONTRACTORS HAVE PAID OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND WHAT MADE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A MONTH ACCORDING TO THE DATA SUPPLIED BY THE STATE. CDCR AND DSHS HEALTH CARE CONTRACTORS ACROSS THE STATE UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BESIDES THIS MONETARY WASTE INTERMITTENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDE LESS CONTINUITY OF CARE CALIFORNIA'S INMATES AND MENTALLY ILL. AND THIS IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE EXPRESS GOAL. OF THE POTTER AND COLEMAN COURT ORDERS. ALSO CIVIL SERVICE MORALE SUFFERS WHEN CONTRACTORS ARE PRESENT. IMAGINE WORKING ALONGSIDE SOMEONE WHO MAKES TWICE AS MUCH AS YOU DO BUT ENJOYS PREFERENTIAL WORK SCHEDULES I KNOW MANDATORY ON CALL DUTIES. NO WONDER THAT MANY OF OUR DOCTORS HAVE QUIT THEIR JOBS. TO BECOME CONTRACTORS. BOB AS BEFORE TWENTY TWO SIXTY AND CENTER OUR- JUST TO STAY BY CREATING A STATE REGISTRY WITH HIGHER PAY SB SIX FIFTY SEVEN ACCESS A COMPLIMENTARY BOOK AND BILL. BY RESTRICTING OUR CONTRACTORS TOTAL TIME THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS IN THE STATE'S POSITION. THAT AMOUNT OF TIME SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR A DOCTOR TO DECIDE IF HE OR SHE WANTS TO BECOME A STATE EMPLOYEE. IN ADDITION THE BILL PROVIDES CONFIDENTIALITY TRANSPARENCY AND FLEXIBILITY TO RENEW THE CONTRACTOR IF THE AGENCY CAN SHOWN ACCEPTED. ONE FURTHER THOUGHT ON WINNING THE STATE OF THE TO DICTION THE CONTRACTORS YOU A PRETTY IN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT BUT NOT ONLY RESTRICTS THE CONTRACTORS TIME ON THE JOB. BUT ALSO THEIR HOURLY RATE. THIS IS WORKED IN THE PAST TO MAKE IT WORK AGAIN. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BY THE DENTAL HYGIENE BORDER CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN. SO WE ASK RESPECTFULLY PRETTIER AYE VOTE ON A. B. SIX FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITNESSED FIRST SUPPORT DR BRIAN KIM PLEASE. HEY BACK TO MINE CAME ON THE SUPPORT OF COOPER A BEACH SIX FIFTY SEVEN- PART OF THE BOARD OF THE- AMERICAN THAT POSITION IN DENTISTRY- THE REASON WHY SUPPORT BILLS BECAUSE THIS KIND OF. DECREASE BECAUSE- OF THE HIRING- TRADITIONS AND DENTISTRY IMPLANT PODIATRIC INTO LAW OUR STATE SYSTEM WE HAVE BEEN USING CONTRACTORS BY THE RATE AT LIKE TALKED ABOUT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT ON THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CALL. AND WE'RE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND TO OUR CONTRACTOR FOR NOT VESTED IN OUR STATE SERVICE BOB THE STATE'S THE EMPLOYEES AFFECTED IN OUR PATIENTS. AND PEOPLE IN OUR STATE SO IT IS BEST TO HIRE STATE SERVANTS FOR GOING GOING TO DO A BETTER JOB INSTEAD OF CONTRACTORS WERE JUST THERE FOR ME A PAYCHECK. AND ALSO GIVING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A CONTRACTED TO DECIDE IF THE STATE SERVICE IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR THEM- GIVING MORE TIME TO YOU KNOW IT WAS NOT GOING TO HELP- YOU KNOW THE STATE AND THE STATE BUDGETARY ESPECIALLY DURING THE COLD WAR ERA. THE LAW SO MUCH UP FUNDING AND MONEY- I THINK WE SHOULD NOT BE WASTING OUR MONEY ON CONTRACTORS AND ALSO LIKE I SAID BEFORE- THE STATE'S UP- STATE SERVANTS WILL BE A BETTER EMPLOYEE A BETTER POSITION TO OUR PATIENTS.
