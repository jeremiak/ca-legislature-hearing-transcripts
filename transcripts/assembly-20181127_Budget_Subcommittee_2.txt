Welcome everybody at today were having an assembly. It's an official assembly budget subcommittee subcommittee number two on education finance. On the higher education in California specifically looking at the campus -- Specific a case study here UC Santa Barbara this is being televised through our assembly -- Web portal on the cal channel so people may be watching across -- California so it's great to be here today. In a sunny Santa Barbara it's raining. And cold up in a Sacramento high I know we appreciate Randy it's gonna rain here in a couple days so. I've had a busy morning here at that's Santa Barbara so far want. To make cancer yet -- Walk on campus I will no chance with. Already. Death thirteen dot focusing on higher in general but specifically looking at that the UC and UC Santa Barbara and of course. I'm excited here to be joined by my assembly member Monique Limon who represents -- Of course Santa Barbara the state assembly -- Also -- Services me on the budget subcommittee overseeing -- Education funding and hired can you see funding. And of course is co hosting this a hearing with me today and I think we're gonna be joined little bit by and by at by senator Jackson. And so again one of the think the the faculty and students for attending this hearing for welcoming us -- You know it's important for us -- To to get out throughout California to see from the campus perspective what's going on and so -- Of course we have tenure yes use and about a hundred community college campuses so it's important for us to get out of the capitol grounds those boring commuting rooms. To see things first hand to talk to students and faculty to see -- Some research professionals and see things -- First hand and you know the UC in the state of California are of course a a partnership. Supporting the UC operations that it hasn't been easy since the Great Recession hit. High as you know but I we have been a bit on the rebound as we know in the last few years we increase funding by about a billion dollars since. Twenty twelve twenty thirteen at welcome Senate Jackson. And we of course have greatly increased a financial aid money as well cal grant program. We're really excited about serving more California students you know when. When -- I know we talk nitty gritty about things and faculty but when I go to my trader Joe's. Soccer field or when Assemblymembers Lee moaned talked people well they all want to talk about their kids their neighbors and getting access to the world class university of California system so -- Certainly with a please that we increase enrollment by fifteen thousand slots for California students. In the last -- Five years and I know UC Santa Barbara has had a piece of that -- Seen the steady growth of an AB planning in the last five years have seen. Certainly -- Help with enrollment growth we know it's the it's a partnership again with the we've had. To look at the three issues state funding. Money from from non resident students throughout California has been sure we have this is to find the system. We also know that higher education more and more. In today's -- You know global economy is the neat you know in order to get a good paying job. Today and tomorrow we need more graduates more people a certificate said you see is a piece of the puzzle and not only -- Having -- Increase enrollment but having graduate within four years. And I know that -- You see is is that UC Santa Barbara I was told earlier it's three point nine years the average time for graduation here. That seems like some type of that type of so you want. To get to that a bit later but asked by that and we need to focus on that statewide as well -- We know there are certainly some needs -- Sauce some facilities here the old. Science buildings which is -- Need a rehab -- You know I think that -- One the side -- So interpreting America looking forward. To pushing Florida capital -- Bonds for higher education of the past few years we've had that solely on the UC system we take in order. To to meet -- And Roman growth and to make sure it's a top notch education system that they use is that system having. Facilities bond the ballot makes sense -- With that -- I know what we're going to have a great opportunity to get done the weeds talk about some issues and I wanted -- To invites -- Salen member León and senator Jackson to say a few words the beginning as well thank you. Thank you chair at I appreciate you being here and and and having this meeting here at as a member of the committee. I was very excited to and when our chair decided that he wanted to visit you see SB because he had not yet this is your first is that right. UCSB. Please enter at to my heart. And the chair is. Can testify how all. It's working at UCSB both with students but also as a staff member here -- And how that really does become part of that the deliberation process it becomes part of the conversations we have -- And I appreciated -- Assembly member -- MCAT McCarty is approach as well as assembly member teams approach [inaudible] Including in and to continue to support premier institutions -- But also to find at a pathway for our students I had to be part of that premier institution I think as assembly member McCarty has said. At a very common question you get and not always in the hearing raining meeting is. And and I don't have I mean we have the director of admissions here so I don't need to even tell her -- How often she must get the question is will my son or daughter didn't get and how do they get in to you see? And that reality -- Doesn't state to add admissions office it really becomes a reality elected officials as well. And we were regularly hearing that -- But I I remind folks that the the reason is because this is a really great. Product that we're offering right it's a really great deal it's a really great experience it's a really great education. And if it wasn't the case then we wouldn't have people in the public regularly asking us about a pathway to get to the UC and to earn a degree from the UC. And that's what it comes down to that we are offering -- Something in California -- That -- All around the world want to be part of at so it's exciting at to be here to hear to get an update -- About where you see SB that and not just in terms of numbers but in terms of also directives on where. You see SB sees itself going -- I think it's an important conversation I know at having worked for the UC sometimes a certain UC's get -- A lot more of our law of the kind of the talk and then other you season so I remind folks that -- Our system is a system and certainly the needs for one you see may not be replicated at other UC's and the situation is different -- I've seen how hard you see SB has tried -- Really been active in not just retirement but in the enrollment looking like California -- I I can't even speak enough to the support services that we provide for students on campus and so that is all -- Very important part of the larger equation -- For us in the state legislature so I think you all for being here thank you and to the chair for hosting this at hearing here. Think. Center Jackson yes thank you arches briefly I want to thank you for including me in this -- Vent -- This is this is our university we do take a very proprietary. Interest in and the Trancers here the chance or is. Is the word ubiquitous or on the present -- Not necessarily omnipotent but on the present -- And has done a great job says the faculty and the student body and in making UCSB one of the finest public institutions in the country. And I'm honored to serve on the Senate -- Budget sub one which is the education subcommittee so I get a lot of love from the university usually around budget time -- But I give a lot of love I I am. So honored to to be the senator representing this area and this university and not just because my husband has been the voice of the gotcha women's basketball -- The public address announcer for twenty five years mind you -- So we feel as though we are clearly family but the the education that comes out of this. Institution the tremendous -- Public and the community -- Interaction of the university provides not just in education for students but a a cultural advantage to the entire -- Santa Barbara community which I am particularly appreciative of and someone who's enjoyed -- It lectures -- Insuring a breaking bread with professors and learning about things that I never imagined in my wildest dreams would to would rise to the for but which actually do have an impact on the future. Of our state I'm also honored to serve as the convener of the you see legislative round table -- And the work that's being done here the research is being done at the university Californian particular ECS be. This extraordinary and I think is a guide post for the future. So. There are so many wonderful things that are coming out of the UC and UCSD and at the same time of course there's always an opportunity to learn to improve to identify things that we may not have -- Been is -- Is clear about and and things that we can do always to improve. To be part of this to hear what some of those concerns are -- The good things that have been going on and what we can do going forward to make it an even better experience for students or faculty. Are in the community at large thank you. Thank you. Thank you out with that we will begin our hearing when to bring up but chancellor gang. To officially welcome S. once again and give an overview of today's hearing and then of course we're going to hear. From different channels relate to budget facilities capital and then a panel of Roman outcome student services. And then finally -- Should have sometimes had this first but the student perspective so the student perspective as well as faculty. So chancellor. Good afternoon -- Chairman McCarty assembly member of the moon and the senators Jackson -- We are and and the whole on a guest we are absolutely honor there. Is to to welcome you to all campus and we are grateful for the opportunity to share with you. Some of San Santa Barbara such shipments and the contributions. We also look forward to discussing is one of the top public research university in California and in the nation. With a history dating back more than one hundred twenty five years. Our campus has close ties to the history prosperity and the vitality of Santa Barbara county as well as to battle for neighboring Ventura and the San Luis Obispo counties. Establishes a manual training school in. Eighteen ninety one and is subsequently becoming the Santa Barbara state teachers college which provide educate towards for area. UC Santa Barbara became part of the university of California system in. Nineteen forty four the today in teaching research and the community service UC Santa Barbara has flourished into a feminine research university whose tremendous -- Impacts benefitted not only the local region but also California or nation and the world of beyond. In September. US news World and World Report ranked of more than eighteen hundred universities in the country. A multiple public universities UC Santa Barbara is not Five also. In the graduation rate. Of fact this year in all one number. Five according to a New York times ranking of the top colleges most committed to economic diverse California state institution committed to academic excellence diversity inclusion. Accessibility and affordability. In two thousand eighteen would receive nearly one hundred and the ten thousand applications. Ninety two thousand for first year students and eighteen thousand four transfers. When I became chance in? Nineteen ninety four the number of freshman applications was seventeen thousands. And this. Sixty so the number has increased by 6100%. Was full we will come approximate fit fifty one hundred freshmen and a twenty five hundred transfers to our campus. This year. I am proud to say that we in rolled the highest number of California students in the history of all campus. Including representation from one hundred California community colleges -- Intro class has in every GPA of four point.

Critical role in supporting -- Educational efforts finally we all exploring a new project with a third of the vendor related to providing workforce housing on campus. That we anticipate what address housing costs to reduce the traffic in the region in the benefit the environment. However the continues support from. Your committee and the colleagues and go having all campus in university California system remain not only the best public universities in the country but also feeling the economic engine of the state and providing the best education. To the citizens of the state of California -- Assist. On the financial health of all campus and the challenges we cover in the face including the issues of deferred maintenance. Again we want to welcome you to all campus and look forward to the opportunity to to share the stories of UC Santa Barbara bush many accomplishments into some awful challenges. Thank you thank you. Okay thank you for that starting soft. Can you hear me. My god great -- Classes. I thank you to chairman of the sec. Bowman and Jackson. My name is James and I and it's in recent. Who services the executive director of budget and planning? Of the division of finance and resource management encompasses the budget office business and financial services. I didn't advisory services procurement institutional research real estate faculty and staff housing and capital and environmental planning. Your packet you have received -- Provides an overview of are campus budget as well as recent history of our revenue and expense trends. As noted our budget is been relatively stable over the last five years. We are reliant on student tuition and fees and state appropriations for the majority of our revenues. With student tuition and fees comprising thirty per se. Appropriations at nineteen other fun sources that make up our annual budget are largely restricted or designated find categories. Such as gifts contracts and grants and exhilarating enterprises. The vast majority of our operating expenses nearly 66% are for employees salaries and wages and employee benefits. He's with -- Gentleman Jim benefit impacts recruitment and retention efforts Martin and I work with chancer Yang to stretch our resources to make ends meet. We utilize an array of strategies to match appropriate resources with campus priorities. In the fulfillment of our mission. Is our offices role to work closely with our chance wearing collaborate with campus constituents on resource planning. To further enhance the success of our students and faculty. Any new initiatives -- Establishes pilot projects through the use of one time funds others are established over a period of two or three years whereby we increase the permanent funds incrementally resources become available. And allow the program to just date with initial one time seeing funding. Later this afternoon you will hear from our colleagues on a few of these newer initiatives. We've also utilize revenues generated from are non resident tuition to address funding gaps to somewhat restore programs. That will reduce during the budget reductions experienced earlier this decade. The challenge of pushing limited resources for further Google lean. Tampa's with since. These. Are high rate of student Plamen allows us to address the challenging local labor market. And provides an important source of income and professional development for our students. While we have been a resourceful and innovative campus many initiatives in early phase opportunities are not pursued due to physical constraints. The best funding scenario for our campus is one with predictable consistent revenue growth over a period of time. Your your financial uncertainties push our campus into a strategy where and we protect resources. Committed to the essential basics and perhaps miss the opportunity to make additional headway in pursuit of excellence. We are accustomed to addressing budget budgetary challenges we are always appreciative of our partnership with the state of California. In securing long term financial viability we can both say the funds invested at UC Santa Barbara bring about positive impact in the lives of our students faculty and staff and for the benefit of our state and nation. Perhaps even more importantly than the annual operating budget challenges we face our campus is feeling significant and growing pressure from limited capital budget resources. We do not benefit from the very financial resources available to campuses with medical centers. And have a much greater reliance on traditional core funds such as state appropriations and student fees for our annual operations. This means our campus has fewer resources to draw upon when seeking funds to construct new instructional and research buildings or to address the ever growing need for deferred maintenance investment. Over the past two decades we have utilized the Garamendi mechanism. To fund capital expansion. As you may know this was a state program that allowed the campus to read [inaudible] In increments the balance between additional in direct cost recovery funds and capital needs. While we were able to construct much needed space this further reduce the amount of flexible funding needed operate our campus. We believe we have leverage this funding source as far as we can. Stem pride program such as physics and engineering are amongst the more desired programs for two days you see applicants. Our ability to accommodate these hopeful undergraduates is impacted by shortage of space. Are physics program is rated by the national Research Council amongst the top five programs in the nation. Since two thousand six we've experienced a 3100% increase in our undergraduate physics majors enrollment and this friends not slowing down. However we've not seen an increase in permanent physics space since. Nineteen ninety four our campus undertaken a planning exercise to program and budget a new building to address the needs for additional physics space. We anticipate the need for a hundred and twenty five thousand square foot building. With the construction costs of roughly a hundred and sixty million to address that current need. Our campus simply doesn't have the fiscal resources necessary to address a facility of that magnitude. Our campus also anticipate to facility of similar size and construction costs for engineering program. A highly ranked engineering program is also in the in great demand from undergraduate applicants and experiences a similar need for instruction and respect space. The likelihood of constructing new physics engine engineering space is entirely reliant on capital funding from the state. In addition to our focus on laboratory buildings all over campus disappointing shooting including humanities and fine arts and social sciences. Are impacted by a shortage of classroom space. As our campus a Roman grows our daily classroom facilities are challenged to keep up with today's instructional needs. The last classroom building on our that our campus constructed was completed in. Nineteen sixty seven we have -- Recently received preliminary project approval from the UC regents for new classroom building to be constructed utilizing AB ninety four funding. As combined with campus funds derived earnings. This building will provide more than twenty three hundred new classroom seats in support of undergraduate education. In addition to the pressing need for major capital investment we're in the process of inspecting our facilities and cataloging or deferred maintenance backlog as part of the UC wide initiative. I present our best estimate of deferred maintenance for our state supported facilities is nearly six hundred million dollars. Most of our buildings range up our range in age from forty building systems are at the end of their useful life. In the past couple of years we've utilized one time state funds to address our greatest points of failure but the backlog is significant and growing larger. Deferred maintenance has also presented challenges for many of our lab renovations as we recruit new faculty. Many of our newly recruited faculty need specialized laboratory instruction spaces and these sorts of reap renovations can trigger building like system replacement. And associated CO complaints upgrades. Issue said to be such as he is make the process of factly recruitment even more difficult. In summary we wish to thank you for the opportunity to highlight some of the challenges we face here at UCSB -- We hope this free presentations been informative. And Martin and I are happy to answer any questions you may have for us. But that hasn't for to have one okay gotcha I do have been times interview questions sure -- As I as I noted earlier Ripper very aware of the capital conversations and because I told them earlier. Whenever we go on a tour of a college campus we always go and see the crime the science lab. Whether it's a community college who UC or CSU so we know that to AB we invested. In the we used to have in the nineties and two thousands and injects remembered. Now that the bonds on the ballot had been they they K.. Fourteen months and I think we should go back through the cake threes three sixteen bonds to focus that for UC and CSU. So that being said -- How much is currently being diverted from your friend for example UC Santa Barbara lot me? To to capital of this all these which otherwise could go -- To campus needs. Student services expanding enrollment you know maybe painting as a picture. Okay -- If if even a back of the envelope if yeah that that's probably the best I'm going to be able to do for you -- So are -- Our overall expenditure on deferred maintenance on a year to year basis is about four point five million dollars if you set aside on in permanent funding. And in addition to that if we have one time funding we increase that those are dollars that we have at the state park sorry at the university that we would have. Directed elsewhere on the campus if we weren't committing those to deferred maintenance programs. I think the the other thing. And and I've just got to give you kind of back of the envelope estimates on that there's you know it at least. Somewhere in the nay lab renovations and facility renovations were utilizing indirect cost recovery from federal grants and we're taking those dollars. In turning around and investing them in renovation lab renovation programs that we work spent money on those laps we probably with. Using for more last -- Off the top. Would be the data associated with Garamendi mechanism. And so that that was a choice the campus made where. We were able to take money that would have otherwise been used for instructional purposes and committed to pay down -- And we have five buildings I think that our Garamendi funded that and the largest one of which is -- Bioengineering building and they believe the Garamendi component of that was about a forty five million dollar. Obligation so the annual -- Interest on all of those buildings combines probably in the neighborhood of seven to eight million would be my guess Longer face [inaudible] The without. A I TP physics yet longer but that will that -- Entropy yeah we did receive philanthropy yeah that's a should know that of course -- We had a donor who provided -- The donor developed project to provide the residents for visitors of our Cavalli institute of theoretical physics up Charlie Munger. Provided that and that was a sixty five million dollar building that he bill for us we didn't have to take something like that on so. If they basically tell you what you're going to bill yeah yeah I mean it's I don't say no but I mean it's that there's not a whole lot of you know given take their yeah certainly -- Donor interest in a project can have varying levels of control but it one one which their funding the entire thing if it is a more at the toners. Discretion certainly in consultation with the campus but yeah. Noticed my brother relationship with Santa Barbara. But he does his aye grandson was a student there you go yeah good kid thing to have enough said he's been actively engage with our campus yeah -- And those kinds of gifts come kind of once in a lifetime yes so. Yeah they are they are very unique we don't see Gipson of that magnitude very frequently he if I may you you didn't mention the housing problem -- Which is a significant problem this was the last university built within the coastal zone -- And as a result building within it is has been. I'd a challenge and and frankly if I'm not mistaken quite expensive yeah -- With it I don't I hope I'm not jumping ahead but it seemed like a logical question ask. Given the fact that you saw a room with three in a room that probably should have been for one and a half dissipating. Resolving that housing problem going forward -- There was a mention by the chancellor which I thought. I did want. To get a little more information about this workforce housing on campus with a third party vendor. Could you perhaps sure I'd be happy to share a little bit and then also the whole housing issue we don't have enough housing here. And UCSB housing and I love this state is legendary. I won't say overall helpful but legendary over the course years were you'll have eight or nine students in a house on what is the the the you know. I forget the street at the moment I don't know what I am thinking del playa fits a two or three bedroom so they create bunk housing in the living room and god only knows what else they're very resourceful. But there just isn't enough housing yes that and then this third party short. Of when you start with a third party project -- Because that's one we're working on right now I think I can work with just one Mike here. Like the stereo effect up -- So Ocean road is a project our campus -- Started working on in two thousand six in the intent there is for us to build -- A major housing development that would be mixed use housing so some retail or campus serving space on the first floor and residential above -- Intended to be entirely for faculty and staff. At UCSB opponent would be a for sale and a component would be rental housing. And this was really our campuses attempt to address workforce housing. On our campus and so what's envisioned is over a project that would -- Delivers somewhere in the neighborhood of five hundred and forty residential units and that would be combinations of one two three and four bedroom units -- Associated parking it's which is currently the border of on the campus with file best I think when you walk to ID last night process. It's a it's a wide road we're going to narrow the road and there is a significant amount of campus land running. Along the north south fine -- Of the border of Isla Vista and that would all be developed to be faculty and staff housing. We're looking to do that what the third party developer. And so the dentist to find -- Development -- Agency that would come in. And would enter into a long term ground lease with the university develop that housing manage the rental component and sell the for sale component of the housing. The faculty and staff. We think -- You know some of the the major benefits of that are obviously bringing. Up our campus population closer to the campus so folks who were commuting hours would have the opportunity to walk to work -- It we also think that. I love this the which is you know currently X. during the summer and during the holiday season -- And then bringing in a different age population that would probably spur different sorts of businesses and really help make sure. That I love this the business district and I think that that's it's an excellent opportunity. For I love this set and for the university of to get a great example of a convergence. I think -- That process we are starting the early planning phase of that and we would intend to use a request for proposal process public process. To identify the developers and we think that'll happen at the beginning of this coming year. And so sometime in twenty nineteen will be out on the streets looking for the development partner. And hopefully make that move board it was included in our party P.. So it has its preliminary approval from the coast mission although it will need of project specific approval -- As the student housing we have -- An agreement with the local community. With our long range development plan that we would build five thousand beds to address our increasing enrollment through the year twenty twenty five we built about fifteen minutes not read. New bands that do that yes correct net new beds is the term I think we use and yeah. That is -- Intended -- To to address all of our enrollment agreement during that time and so. We've. As we opened a San Joaquin which was a thousand new balance in apartments around ascetic Catalina the tower resonances malls -- We're currently in the planning phase for the next phases of student housing -- And we're considering at like a variety of options of what the the best way to go -- Part LRT Pete envisioned redeveloping existing housing sites. And so going into what is currently stork apartments -- Senate as apartments in our west apartment as well as some of the Channel Islands residents also we toured today. To redevelop those areas and increase the density and build additional. Housing [inaudible] The number [inaudible] Two I think a difficult environment for young people. Living three people to a room -- That's really not intended for more than -- Two and other things of that sort. The fact that you're going to increase the density concerns me a little bit -- I'm told some of this can create. Health issues. Mental health issues. I mean I I'm too old to envision being back in college and having to share a room with anybody -- Hard enough sharing a house with but I think this is. This is a concern I I can I don't know if it's within the scope of the state's national. City I thought you meant multi story or you're not talking about within all all the people in it in an individualized could not not more people sharing bedrooms ideally. We would be de chanting those students that are in the in three person rooms. Into two rooms yeah that would that would ultimately be the call but that being said putting is the to rather than three are you actually increasing availability of housing or just making it more livable -- We would be increasing the availability okay yeah that is the intent. Well I'm glad to hear that that that I was misunderstanding I just think. We've got to take into account human behavior and trying to crunch a whole bunch of people into a room is. Is not good. For for one so I think mental and physical health. Care thank you you know what I had some budget questions but let's take that stick on housing from it because because frankly this is an issue. Not Santa Barbara you see why see is you wide it. There are no easy -- Solutions to it and so we're trying to to think out outside the box -- You know one thing that I I I've been seeing across California and even right in my district. By. They get landers under utilized strip mall across the street or few. More than a mile away. And you know tearing it down and build a multi family housing there because universities you know. We hear a lot about housing plans to meet with you know present the poll thành I'll talk about. But that's not your bread and butter and you know that you bred better is educating students and two buildings in hand facilities and that's hard not in and of itself. Yep but you know doing massive housing development just it's it's it's it's it's not. On my* so. No here you have third straight -- You know. Did you in simplicity. My understanding is. Here's all the title more land outside of the university so that's Mike my first things kind of what's happening on the outside you know. If you start with that sure well it you know it's an interesting environment for us here so when we went forward with our long range development plan in -- Two thousand ten the chancellor encouraged us to get out and meet with the representatives of the county of Santa Barbara Santa Barbara and city a leader. And actually negotiate the terms for whatever development would look like and what were the conditions that. That they would find acceptable as we move forward so weak we engaged in a multi month process -- With those folks and one of the conditions they felt very strongly was that we had to absorb a 100% of our enrollment growth on existing campus land. And they did not want us to buy. Any land from either Kalita or the I love this to and develop not because it was a concern about coming off the tax rolls. And so there was a real emphasis for us to build and develop on our existing land and that terms we agreed. To wear that any housing bills -- I think there's some things we probably didn't understand at that time week we didn't quite understand what the make up of I love this to was -- We thought it was just UCSB students and community and I think there's a much larger population in Isla Vista and as we build housing. I live as the cap back feeling very quickly -- The city of galena has has -- Approved and constructed a significant amount of residential space. Both for sale and rental space and their intent and desire is they would rather that be. For nine students and so what they they've kind of looked at is is this is for good leaders growth and they don't want to see you see espys growth. Consuming that housing and so there hasn't been a mindset of saying cam the community. Bill the housing for the university and and we stick to just doing university there was really a push for us. To be self sufficient in that regard. I think as we looking go forward we have to consider options -- When we did the long range development plan there was not a lot of third party development in the UC system? And now it's you know it's it's rampant it's change that we probably need to go back to the city and county and talk through. You have something that About your that's okay chancellor but when they had something but back to the the overall housing crunch -- It's it's it's really to Paul that the impacts it's one is that just the debt load if you have could that debt load for the average you see your seats you graduate. Between twenty and thirty granted it's not tuition you know. Because two thirds of your students here other kids. Cal grant held or enter the you know the UC coal or middle class scholarship to the paying minimal tuition and housing. And then of course -- You know to look at but access if we had more housing that you would be less pressure the long redevelopment plan you can stretch out of certain more. Californians and more than people that are hit me up at trader Joe's about how. Their kids want to be a Galgiani even from Santa Barbara So -- What could this what could we're talking all about problems here double I I know we talked about this? One for college students. I have to admit I haven't thought about. It you know forever housing is being considered something that was a self supporting -- Enterprise in so it was never eligible for state support. And so -- You know probably it would be and the incentives for developers and and spring the development community. I think would be an area where the state could play a and is there anything I entitled issues because certainly. If you went bottom vacant lot. You know. Austrian Isla this that now for example you have to go through that. Santa Barbara county planning department all that but if you have it on you see land you go through your own. Houses is rare been thoughts as far as if it's university project within a certain area and any ideas about entitlement. And development. Well that's that's probably one of the great advantages university house is being its own. You know that certainly is something that helps. But again we are in a situation where our local community didn't want us to expand our physical footprint and to the neighboring communities and so. You know it's it's it probably is -- The better poll of us buying property elsewhere is the impact on property tax. I think that that's the thing that's about that would be difficult for the county if we come in and we buy something and take it off the tax rolls -- If we're keeping on the tax rolls that puts a challenge on the affordability and so there's a little bit of a vicious circle -- And in that regard. So if you if Santa Barbara bought land just across the street Derek and I love this stuff. Would you take can you entitle it through the UC process yes yeah. Okay yeah. Yeah so when we buy it if it comes region's land we entitled it through the UC process. Now we're still in the coastal zone. So we still have to go through the coastal -- Commission for any sort of approval of the developing an outside of the coastal zone then it would solely be at the region's for entitlement. It is sort of the dilemma It's not. You can do. We are clear and I think get UCLA instead of are we don't have adequate housing for our students. So it took a chicken and egg problem. And I would suspect that not only are there some fiscal issues but I think in terms of land use and so forth. I'm not sure go leaders excited about having more students and have this design incorporated night there are those issues and you know it really is a bit of a dilemma but it does add to the cost of students coming to school when they have got -- To pay exorbitant amounts of money for very little in the way of a place to live and I I don't know if you see SB has a problem but I keep hearing about different schools where some of our students are living in their cars and and couch surfing and that's just. No way to you can't study you know center Jackson. You. Yeah yeah yeah. Accommodating the student for the housing is is only one of the most important thing -- Actually -- Because of the increasing and in state students we want accommodate more California students. So we we need more. Most pressing needs other more classrooms teaching. Learning facilities and also increased the number of staff to take care of them -- The increasing number Offa faculty members to give them better teaching an accommodation and then the building the facilities for a comedy they living -- Environment it is one of the very important thing if the state can help us in the other areas like teaching faculty and all that I think university when we do well we can also seek from anthropic support to help us. With -- With with the dormitories we're still working on that so their own these old rule problems. And if we campaña accommodating more students I think we can ease that the niece and I have a stock which is one of five all current effort as well. Because I'm gonna go back to the budget -- And I appreciate the conversation about housing I think it historically number sessions about housing in Santa Barbara county -- Have been difficult. Whether we look at that lends from -- From the student perspective or just from residents perspective -- And I think that that will continue -- Related to the budget it was great to hear and to at you know things are going well now. And in the state legislature we've also had conversations about what the future of California's budget looks like. And one of the questions I know that at some of the folks that have followed that the hearings at the state level have heard me ask that I want to ask locally is. What are we doing to prepare for the next recession -- As a campus -- And some predict sooner rather than later and how are we preparing so that we don't see -- Some of the elements that we've seen in past recessions that results in you know I mean if you look at the history that's when tuition has gone the highest rate in the period of recessions -- And so forth and that's also a very difficult time but what is the campus doing now to think about that. Yeah I would say. That if you know. Our role Martin and I share the role of really being careful stewards of our funds. And so as we work on our Alex is a fun. One the permanent fund and hear we permanent commitment and that. Also is is can extrapolate to a staff member or faculty member and so it's really got to do with -- Hiring people so the more the more are -- We would add to our work force the more we'd have a an ongoing obligation that would be severely impacted in the budget cuts. And so I think it's a campus we've been frugal about our staffing and we've been -- We we've been a campus that looks at how can we do more with less. And have focused on that we are -- In a in a period where we're really looking at our the funding gaps that started in two thousand eight and how we address those I think an important dialogue we're gonna be having on our campus in the next couple of years is. Your what programs are really important to continue -- What programs maybe shouldn't continue and that's never an easy conversation to have that's something that can help safeguard us but it's really taking a look at where where are permanent obligations and where are our -- Less permanent obligations in trying to understand how we balance that I think we ban -- We've been encouraging. Folks -- To to look at their funds it and occasionally we have -- Some give funds where we really encourage folks to put those into funds functioning as announcements where they generate some interest revenue. During the period with which they aren't spent so sometimes will receive some source of funding. It's intended to be spent over a seven to ten year period and we know that spending periods coming a little later. And so we're talking about investing that money right now so it yields some interest return and that the mean time -- We're trying whatever we can to make ourselves a little bit more recession proof. I think that -- The budget cuts weeks uber really difficult for our campus and we've struggle to get our faculty FTP back up to the levels they work. In two thousand seven eight and where we're barely there. And so -- I would say we certainly haven't gone and over spent at present and so that that will in another itself protect us a bit -- But I think looking at the watchful answer P. and really growing outside of our campus has been an important part wherever we can. Look at something is creating revenue is equally important quite frankly we seen a greater sharing of campus obligations. And financial obligations with auxiliaries on our campus where we've we've taken the entities that are revenue generating and ask them to carry more of the work of the love so. Some of those strategies have been helping us as well just. The most important strategy up off all what we talk about is tenth. We have gone through several recessions are myself going through it. But I think one of the most important principle is that. We should have developed the principles that that. No matter what we do. We must not a come. So with these two large principles then we make the budget cut and trim and also. We we do it very carefully -- With all what it Chuck just mention about -- The waste to to to to to if it comes to a recession. But we will I think education. Quality. And diversity of the most important principle that. We must not compromise. Just to add -- To what Chuck was saying in terms of tactics so are permanent budget has been growing there's been enrollment growth instead of having the the permanent budget grow exactly with enrollment we've tried to be a little more conservative with that and maybe like a year or two what if and Roman. Pope pulled back but what if there were other pressures so that's the specific tactic we've done with various fund sources -- Ticket that cushion at Chuck described. I see here on the the non residents enrollment that of course has been a hot issue in the state legislature last year's and up assembly pushed very hard couple years ago the region's adopted. Happen in this faster in the budget the Senate actually adopt a language trying to go. To lower lower numbers and so that's you know would be nice as well. And and so he for a lot of the campus is it's it's made a huge chunk of the revenue to to basically you know keep it going. And so sub campuses like. LA in Brooklyn San Diego they have you know more. More money per student and so there. Academic quality you could argue is little bit different than at number Saturday riverside which had some some of the lower lower number so looks like Santa Barbara's kind of in the middle of the season but you have. Gone up the last five years from from five two to sixteen and so I assume that's been a big chunk. Of on my revenue and some some -- Some of the a like this but they're able to utilize their Medical. Center revenue to help make a go of it so. In mice my district I have UC Davis. I represent not the campus that that the Medical Center which is a huge part of the UC Davis enterprise in LA -- San Diego of course and so -- Maybe you can paint a picture of Santa Barbara how you're able. To how it impacts the you know the average experience for your undergraduate students. With not having the Medical Center and what you've been able to wear the monies go from the increase revenue -- For international and non and out of state students and conversely if you didn't have that what it would look like for instance. Yakin talk about the non resident part for yeah so I don't we have a four hundred twenty two million dollars as of budget to sure from student tuition and fees. And a hundred and thirteen million of that is the non resident students. Border directly yet 27% of that. And and as you mentioned that's grown over the last -- In a address the other. Well I would just say that the you know it has become an important source of revenue for the campus it's a what I would call perhaps more flexible form of revenue and so -- It's something that we've utilized -- We've covered some dead expenses with that we certainly have been dedicating those dollars towards a deferred maintenance program we mentioned -- There been a number of of programs around student success some of the program's you'll hear about today -- We've also been making investments is sustainability with some of those dollars -- And that's been a really important one for us because it has a kind of a two for a fact it's meeting our goals as a campus for sustainability. But it's also managed to corral all our utilities expenses and it's a bit over that period of time. But our energy use has not. And so that's from some of those investments coming that way -- I would just say in principle and in the end. For me philosophically as I look at non resident tuition. It's not the most comfortable source of revenue for me as a manager on the campus because it it puts us. Reliant on the economy of other countries and as long as those economies are generating Revenue. And you know they're productive a nothing. Being their students. Does make me worry when we have a potentially in a disproportionate amount of what we're counting on is permanent budget coming from -- Other nations and whatever their economic policies are so. There's volatility associated with that I don't think it is a you know something that should be a long term strategy to say keep growing that in river and in support of other funds going away right now are. Total. Non resident rather revenues equal to about 50% of our state support. So it it it is a significant chunk of money -- On the campus that we are reliant on but it it does worry me. So that the policy that the region's adopted. Now two years ago. Have had a cap of no more than Campuses that were already about twenty correct so that means that. Right now. Santa Barbara here at 16% yeah non resident and you could. Legally go up to eighteen right yes is that the plan. I don't know I think we've you know we we have not made such a plan nobody you know I have to say although state is not just in our nine out of standing many out of California and other forty nine states still counts. Yeah yeah. Is there a huge. Demand you have way more applications for non resident. Than you do slots available I would have to have -- Or director admissions answer that I believe that is the ACLU's you see why I know that yeah even even when we increased. Non resident we feet there hasn't even though the whatever elasticity. Study with us right hasn't had much of a drop so in other words even. There's a huge demand we could internationally and other states nine the non resident tuition combined with our tuition your housing expenses and we have you know there's a policy that there's no financial aid. Provided to non residents so there we were competing with you know what what may be the cost of other -- You know prime ivy league schools into whether we've price yourself out of that market I think Lisa can talk about that when she's up here -- It it -- But obviously by going from. In in the last eight years. You've quadrupled from four to sixteen so there is a demand people are there is only about the Santa Barbara story of course you could walk out and see the beautiful ocean. And and I think probably work it's out. The other people or from your home state or for the country and so forth about the experience you're finding and you see SB certainly -- The the one thing I did want to bring up though that that you had mentioned that. The the language from the Senate about reducing yeah nonresident rolling down -- To down 210% of enrollment that that impact for our campus would be about forty two million dollars of what we would can now call permanent funding. That's that's almost equivalent to was for a for UCSB when the UC experience a very large budget cuts so it. Is significant let me ask want one more question about student fees and I'm guessing is very unpopular. But but sometimes I wonder. For the student fee increases if we shouldn't go forth with it in the first place because it really boils down. To upper middle class students who who are impacted I think I'm not sure the number here at UC Santa Barbara finding is that. Well over half the students. A new no tuition and all other cal grant of power is it two thirds it happens. It's it's over half I don't know that number right off the top of my head we probably have it here and then. A few years ago we adopted the middle class scholarship so now we go up to find. Two thirds of tuition for income I think it's up to now hundred and seventy thousand dollars roughly better. For a family of four and so. You know that's a great. Who are some of the suits a so? If it comes down. To in you when you build your budgets you're looking for a minor saying is kind of a three piece -- Stole yeah non resident money state monies to get the money yep and so. Sometimes I just wonder is it worth I know that students. Student fees like the holy -- Third rail -- And I get it but you know for many many students who come in and talk about the student fee increases we ask them like that they'll pay tuition anyway yeah because they get financial like some. I see some students screaming back yeah and I I I think that that is. Most likely an unpopular idea I from a from a purely economic standpoint. There there is a large segment of our enrollment that has their tuition cover into the idea of raising their tuition. The return to a component of that raise tuition insurers that they in fact this portion of the population is in paying it -- It'd shifting that expense burden to the higher income state not. That's the economics of it. The I you know somewhere around two thousand and eight nine was when we kind of the path. Being being equal. To two I'm in a back then. For for the for the budget now its way to where you know the students are paying 37% and the state's at nineteen and so that. That's released swayed quite a bit and so I think that their you know there's a there's a concern about -- Is is -- If the unit if the state can't restore funding similar to where it had been before that pressure will naturally moved towards. Tuition. I would just say for myself when I came here as was two hundred forty eight dollars a quarter. You know it's it it was a long long time ago and the state was in a much different style places well you're depriving it's an important question because it's a reality check as as as literally months that we've we've had a five year run. In the economy California budget like no other in a hundred years and it's not going to continue. And it just the laws of economics are gonna have a reality check in your future so. We have to to to weigh those things out I will note that in this one thing we always perspective. It is that the state increase has gone down but that student be revenue keep in mind that a bunch that state money as well as a we increased. Fees ready pay them the counter in the grant program so read look as how much money from the state California checkbooks going to pay. For college you may not all be going. To you see what it goes the student commission and back door to see so it's still is yeah cal grant it's just. Yeah yeah. Okay. Thank you this was -- Helpful. And again there's there's no magic so they were looking for it is just helpful in understanding the decisions we make up beard Sacramento. Impacts of cost [inaudible] Scott. Conservative approach to funding has any impact on your you know the folks who work here. And I know that for graduate students one of the keys to getting. Could graduate students is being able. To and I know that the university has had some challenges because we don't offer them -- Particularly much and instead of coming to UCSB they go to the university of Texas or some other ungodly place. And you know it makes it difficult for us to keep to sustain that quality. Of educational experience those researchers are helpful to the professors who want to have those students. The top in a we want the cream of the cream here to be. Our students so it's a it's of a yin and the Yang here we're not. By being frugal -- It's sometimes does also cost us the quality of of student that we're looking for particularly in the graduate level so. I'm mindful of that and I appreciate the question what are we doing the next recession hits big [inaudible] Refer people. Thing is that we and so. Contributed the school I don't know how much more we can expect them to do -- Any more longer grandkids we can real. Well. I I will stand silent on that but there certainly are folks out there who do appreciate this great university -- But that we can't rely on that. For our programs okay thank you thank you with us today this panel next we're gonna have a handle on in Romans outcomes the student services. So please come on up. For for participants Thank you chair McCarty. Assembly member Monique and senator Jackson I'm Jeff stop will associate vice chancellor for undergraduate education. With me here is Linda Adler Kassner faculty director for the center of innovative teaching research and learning. We appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about UC Santa Barbara innovative three sixty degree support for achievement of our rigorous learning outcomes. Would like to thank the legislature for this accomplished the number. Is noted our student body is also increasingly diverse 30% identifies under represented minorities and 41% are first generation college students. Also emphasize that we are the first member of the prestigious association of American universities to be certified as a Hispanic serving institution. Additionally of note is that 30% of our students come from families with an income below fifty thousand dollars a year. This matter is for learning. Family income correlates most strongly with educational preparation and achievement. One consequence is a gap in GPA and time to completion for some of the students. To address this gap we've created innovative programs to develop a thriving learners. We referred to them as three hundred and sixty degree programs because they support learners and faculty. We know that learning is a two way street students need to be prepared to learn from faculty and faculty need to know how to best invite students into a learning process. After all learning is something that someone does not something done to them. Learning takes practice feedback from experts and time. Our programs help students develop three parts of an equation that lead to success in college and beyond. Disciplinary knowledge skills for academic and career success. And senses of themselves as learners. Wilshire illustrations a programs we've created in conjunction with each piece of this equation. Also share with you ways we hope you can help us advances work. First or two academic success centers -- Beyond us or opening new doors for exhilarating six engine. And a transfer student center. Both support entering students especially first generation and low income students both opened in. Twenty fifteen donde center with support from a two point five million dollars H. us I grant from the US department of education. And the transfer student center with support from one point six million dollars in special student success funding from the UC office of the president. Provide academic advising academic mentoring. Structured opportunities for students to get to know faculty and workshops focusing on all aspects of cops life. More than. Six thousand I visited centers. More than. 140% of the campuses Waldron elation in fact uses the TSC regularly. Under us and the TSC illustrate the comprehensive support that you see SB provides for students to be our institutions rigorous learning outcomes. Develop senses of belonging here. But three hundred and sixty degree support also extends beyond students. We work with back across campus to develop innovative pedagogies to make their expertise more accessible. For instance thirty nine faculty have participated in the yearlong seminar supported by the department of education title five grant. They redesigned assignments in courses to improve student learning. By the end of fall quarter twenty eighteen these thirty nine faculty will talk more than thirty eight thousand students. That is only one example of this kind of program efforts contribute to improving students learning and improving retention and time to degree. Through all this work with faculty and students we have identified important practices that contribute to learning gains. Will show just two of them. The first is incorporating active learning and teaching. Sir Steve got gallons large biological anthropology lecture watch video lectures take online quizzes and submit questions about quirk course content in advance of class meetings. In class they discuss the questions with each other and with professor gallon. This active learning approach makes the most of face to face class time through interaction and engagement. Research shows that this approach contributes significantly to learning especially among under represented low income and first generation students. The second is academic mentoring especially from undergraduate peers. Right now eight departments have such programs which contribute significantly to learning games. We are also using technology for the support. We collaborate with university of Michigan on each coach a technology platform that provides course specific coaching written by humans to support learning and study strategies tailored for students. You coach was initiated using one point seven million dollars in one time funding we received from the legislature to support low income students. Students from underrepresented minority groups and students enrolled and local control funding formula schools. To conclude we want to identify two ways we hope you can support our three hundred sixty degree approach. First the legislature can provide stable sustain support for programs that help us close the achievement gap for all learners. The programs we described here have been supported by stood. Rents like the one from the department of education. And Elsie FF plus funding from the legislature. Of these only student success funding from you see okay as permanent. The campus is trying to sustain funding for these programs and others like them the support timely degree and success. Second you can help us create As we've noted that everyone has you see SB is one of the most beautiful campuses on the outside but classrooms and labs as you've noted don't necessarily match the exterior. We don't have space for a booming student population. Learning spaces are in desperate need of renovation built at a time when we knew less about the importance of active learning pedagogies for learning games. The support is critical even as we plan. Classroom [inaudible] And for efforts. For funding and that is. The state can help us make a difference here at UCSB. And more importantly a difference for California like you we believe that all of our students are learners and citizens and together we can build a better future. Thank you ammo for to any questions you have. Elected team -- DJing. I get a lot. Of us on our to show one of the things if I may Mister yes -- Jump in here of one of the things that we look for in the legislature and is frequently -- Lacking the some metrics. So. How much money have you spent how many students have you dressed water the success levels how are you measuring success? We're going to put more money in and help make this permit which is what I yeah well it's working graduation rates take time to to measure we hope to see improvements in graduation rates -- Particular for the transfer students -- Is. That's a real concern for us. I think that will be important Telesat I mean if you have a program that works. I suspect we're going to want to implement that elsewhere if it's the best program out there but that is I think something that -- Becomes important this is tell us how how well it's it's a call. School I'm. We absolute Kerr with that assessment Dreamland. The main areas. Work and work as the redwood education. One of the challenges is that learning games take time to manifest themselves so if we implemented. Intervention. It could have short term results can have different kinds of long term results and so we have data on some of the short term results of some of these and we just decided to a sort of sweet of kinds of interventions and program so we have data on some. Of them. But twenty fifteen is not long ago so we need more time so you measuring. The students whether that graduating or not what what if some of them are at risk of it is the goals the goal to see them graduate is the goal to see them get jobs as a goal to see them get ago want to get. Other degrees so made those are things I think that would be helpful for us to know what it is you're measuring right yes programs are specifically focused I think and and getting students to graduate on time there's a lot of other. Wonderful thing state. In the camps is doing in terms of steering students into graduate programs when that's appropriate action their scholars and you see leads and many others we didn't just to focus on the the job thing is. Trickier for us to get a handle on that our office doesn't have that kind of data unfortunately that's where they go we know Francis so one of the programs that I mentioned was that this you coach which is that tailored coaching program written by humans for students -- So we have data from the initial pilot runs of that. Intervention in a one of our big introductory biology courses and we've seen some very positive results but that means for example that we seem changes in students -- Self their believes in themselves of students their study behaviors their study practices there are grades from one biology course of the next biology course but that's but in the time that we've had that's those of the metrics we can collect right now. So some of the longer term -- Interventions like -- Changes and faculty members teaching practices most take longer time to collected on any other questions. All right so I think we will have. The next. Said a panelist great thank you. A good afternoon I'm my name's Lisa press Cup I served as the director of admissions. I've probably worked for the department of admission since my graduation in. Nineteen eighty five thirty three years if you're doing the math. I thought it would be best to start with the mission of the office of admissions quite simply were charged with and rolling the student body that demonstrates high academic achievement. Exceptional personal talent. And reflects the diversity of California by providing services to families and educational professionals throughout California. Our services can be broken down into the following categories statewide outreach. Application services online services and counselor services. Statewide outreach includes in person visits with students from as far south as San you cedar high school near the Mexican border. To the northern most unity college in California college of the Siskiyou this which is fifty miles south of the Oregon border -- Application services unit ensures each application is thoroughly reviewed. In preparation to submit the nineteen you see applications students can view the tutorial that we've created and posted to you. To the tutorial is received nearly eleven thousand views. Is commonly used by California counselors to advise students on their campuses. Yes he has been on UCSB is online tools insure families who lacked the ability to travel to campus have access to the information they need to prepare for the university. These tools were created at the suggestive counselors from low resource California high schools who expressed concern that their families did not have the resources to visit each UC campus. While these tools are available to anyone with internet access approximately 85% of the users are from California. Lastly our our cancer services provide tools and resources that school personnel used to best serve their students. The office of admissions is comprised of fifty dedicated staff members many of whom are used. Graduates all are passionate about creating educational access. Many of our staff myself included since we understand the challenges and road blocks. On the path to attain in a college degree. I'd like to highlight some examples of our successes and I'll follow that with some specific services that we provide. Families in California. Fall twenty seventeen marked the term that you see SB exceeded a total African American undergraduate enrollment of one thousand this was achieved through long term out reach program development and a commitment by the campus leadership to fund these initiatives. Personal attention matters when it comes to making crucial enrollment decisions UCSB takes pride in the personal service. An example of this would be our postcard campaign that we coordinate in the office of admission. Last year more than thirteen thousand underrepresented students received hand written postcards from faculty staff students congratulating them on their admission to the university. Cancer Yang mentioned our reception since nineteen ninety four chancer Yang has hosted eight hundred and twenty eight receptions throughout California for top applicants. In total these programs have served more than sixty six thousand students and parents. Within one hundred UCSB representatives participating each program. Receptions are an example of campus wide collaboration among administrators faculty alumni staff and current students to bring the best students to UCSB. Were proud of our reputation for excellent service counselors regularly share with us that you see as be as the office they're going to call when they have questions. The entering class of fall twenty eighteen reflects the success of our long standing out reach programs. 41% of our new students are first class. Under represented minority groups. There's definitely tons more work to be done -- All giving announcement samples of some of our specific initiatives. As service California high schools remain our top priority. Each fall our outreach team this is approximately nine hundred and fifty high schools providing information about the UC system and UC Santa Barbara specifically. Typically re reach between ninety thousand and a hundred thousand students during those two months of fall out reach. High school students enrolling at UCSB for the fall term eighteen reflect the most academically talented group of students in our campus history. A unique program we coordinate is our most influential teacher award each year we ask incoming freshmen to nominate a teacher who is impacted their lives. These teachers receive a certificate and a thank you letter and easiest poster to display in their classrooms. And a copy of that letter is also sent to their principal acknowledging their contribution to our student success. Service to California community colleges is another key priority UC Santa Barbara is the only state to visit every California community college during the fall application cycle we've done this for the last three years. UCSB maintains a transfer guarantee programming program ensuring that students from any California. College have access to our campus we currently have one admission cam where bass Sacramento -- This allows us to buy around services meant to diversity is reflected in our enrollment achievements already mentioned card and pay bed like to share. Our exit polls. I have. For you today of our resource guides -- That address that unique informational needs of underserved populations we were the first you see to create these guides. These include informational guides for American Indian Chicano Latino African American Asian American and foster youth we also produce guides for veterans. LGBTQ communities and low income families with basic needs -- A few of these guys are still at the printer I put you sample of just a few of them. Our LA to SB program provides low resource Los Angeles schools with the campus tour experience that includes bus transportation from LA to Santa Barbara lunch in the dining Commons and a student panel. Where students can hear from UCSB students who come from similar backgrounds? Through special funding from the campus we have two full time professional admission counselors dedicated to divert the initiatives one is stationed in Los Angeles. There is here on campus together these it cancers create special programming serving first generation students particular attention is focused on community based organizations we have a close relationship with programs throughout the state such as the council of African American parents. And William Douglas foundation southern California and the young scholars program in Hayward. UC Santa Barbara is the only you see to employ an advocacy model of that reach. Every American Indian Chicano -- To foster youth applying to UCSB is assigned an admission counselor designated as their advocate. The advocate make certain that every applicant has a one stop. Mayes on so if they had any questions about any campus services financial aid housing whatever the case might be they have one person that they can call. To help them navigate the campus that advocate works with the student from the point that they apply until up there admitted and ultimately enroll at UCSB to the point they move into the residence halls. We maintain close relationships with UCSB student organizations who are committed to helping with the varsity initiatives when partnership is with the black student union. Campus leadership has provided admissions with permanent funding to create out reach programs that focus on African American high school and community college students throughout California. Our service -- To campus visitors is very comprehensive the visitor center serves approximately fifty four thousand guests annually we provide a virtual tour of L. one Spanish Mandarin and Korean. For families who cannot visit in person. Faculty and more than fifty classes per quarter open their doors to our campus visitors who want to have the opportunity to experience a lecture from esteemed faculty member. Finally our online services are available to those who are not able to meet with admission counselors in person. These services include webinars virtual transfer advising appointments online chats virtual classroom presentations to Abbott classrooms and online college fairs. We also have an expansive array of videos available to students on our you tube site with specific videos produced for African American Chicano Latino transfer and foster youth. Again these online services are used for students and counselors for instance 89% of our weapon our viewers are from California. We do face some challenges as we create and implement our outreach services. Success can be hampered if our funding is not consistent across fiscal years in general most successful initiatives take two to three years to fully mature. And to take root in California high schools and community colleges. What we're tremendously grateful for any new funding even one time funding if the funding is one year only it is more challenging to realize long term results? Comprehensive review of the application -- Is critical -- We need to fully understand the talents of a particular student beyond just GPA and SAT. Review and a hundred and ten thousand of those applications is a massive undertaking -- We use a team of about a hundred and fifty readers that must complete this arduous task in about ten to twelve weeks time. Applications are far more complex than when I began in this profession for example California community colleges are offering a very large array of border called dual enrollment classes. Community college courses offered on the high school campus. Many high school students are completing these courses in addition they're taking online courses there attending summer programs at different colleges and universities. So these programs definitely make it didn't more prepared for university level work but it definitely creates a much more complex application to review. The mandated two to one ratio of men to trance moment Actually [inaudible] Camp [inaudible] Related [inaudible] See. There are two community because Santa Barbara county. Combined those two community colleges bring us only 17% 1718% of our total transfer enrollment. So that basically means we are far more reliant than other. UC's to bring in out of area students to campus to hit that two to one mandated ratio. Average to special populations such as under represented minority groups transfer students veterans and foster youth require time intensive services. Again our geographic location means that we must travel throughout communities simply put the geographic location of Santa Barbara makes out reach more expensive. Demand for stem majors is at all time high. This creates tremendous -- Demand for lab space in teaching assistants which has been mentioned already today while the campus is working to address these issues it mission staff must work diligently. To help students discover majors across all disciplines. The type of specialty out reach program requires labor intensive services. Finally competition to enroll our most talented under represented California students is fierce. The biggest concern is financial aid. Our low income families are near panic when they see the total cost of attendance and middle income families are deterred by fear of student loan debt. It mission cancer spend significant time addressing these concerns. Colleges from outside California are now placing regional representatives within California to recruit our most promising students away. These schools offer scholarships that often cannot be matched by UC this is starkly black colleges and universities now recruit heavily in California. And host college fairs it at key California community colleges the H. B. C. use have also developed guaranteed admission programs with the California community colleges that are competing with the UC guarantee programs. I thank you for your time and your interest in our out reach programs I hope this interview. This overview demonstrates our passion for service -- And arguments California schools thank you [inaudible] The given. Good afternoon my name is Mike Miller and I'm the assistant vice chancellor for enrollment services. I'm here to share some of our innovative work around critical issues like access affordability and basic needs. Thanks to our generous financial aid awards and several in the several new programs around student support UC Santa Barbara was re recently ranked number two in a New York times college access index which ranks colleges and universities for their support of low income students. While we're proud of a number two ranking we also we also know that we have a lot of work to do and in these areas. With the rising cost of higher education and constantly evolving needs of our students UC Santa Barbara continues to look for ways to ensure student success. As my colleagues have said predictable funding models are vital when trying to plan ahead. This is something our students also struggle with traditional financial aid models determine eligibility on a year by year basis. This means low income first generation college students commit to a campus only knowing how that they'll pay for one year of their education and are often left to wonder about years two three and four four years ago UC Santa Barbara launch a pilot program designed to address this issue. Call the UCSB promise scholar program. The program offers talented hide high need incoming freshmen a pretty well for your financial aid out outlook using existing financial aid programs. Transfer students are offered to years of predictable funding Kalra and services to ensure they thrive in the classroom as well as in the UCSB community. Here's what we've learned so far the model a predictable funding and wrap around services is working. We currently have four hundred fifteen students in the in the program and of those a hundred and twenty three year in their fourth year. Of the students we welcome the campus in the first year of the program all but one remain enrolled in on track to graduate. A remarkable 93% are on trial are on track to graduate in four years or less. Into date the overall GPA for the entire program is a three point. Three to put this in perspective the average household income of our promise scholars is less than twenty five thousand dollars a year. Under normal sort circumstances we know many of the students would be at risk of having to drop out or stop out there in our academic careers. Due to financial hardship. However however under our model they are thriving graduating and graduating on time. Last fall UC Merced launched a multi your financial aid program and other UC campuses are exploring similar similar efforts. Another program we recently implemented that is seeing positive results is our financial crisis response team. National research shows that when college students drop out or stop out it is almost always due to financial obstacles that tend to be less than five hundred dollars. Last fall UCSB launch this this program which is designed to catch students before they fall through the cracks. A diverse committee meets to review student you. Can see five and also connect with other can to research. The reason while. In the committee is currently This. It's who lost homes in both the will see and campfires. Last year the undergraduates who responded reported being food into care. With this in mind the global food initiative and great efforts like SB eighty five were launched. UCSB is taken those resources in implemented some impactful programs to ensure our students have access to help the in the in nutritious foods. Our faculty staff and students are passionate about food security. Back in twenty eleven student leaders launch the campus food bank. In its first week of existence the food banks are five students. Fast forward to today more than sixteen hundred students per week access the campus food bank. You see SB is also leading the way in terms of accessing the cow fresh program. Nearly three last year nearly three thousand students took advantage of the program resulting in over five million dollars in purchasing power for our students. This year we're on pace or in role in role six thousand students in that program far more than any other UC campus. UCSB continues to educate students on things like cooking healthy meals shopping on a budget and much more. The campus also recently broke ground on a student farm which will supplier food bank with fresh produce and service service a laboratory for our faculty and students. Thanks the funding from sources like SB eighty five you see SB is quickly and effectively addressing food and security. It is important to note the leadership of assembly member let alone around it SB eighty five which is designed to create hunger free campuses across California. This fall we also started a housing voucher program to help students were facing short term housing emergencies. Through the financial crisis response team students can apply for vouchers for up to five hundred dollars which can be used for on campus or off campus housing situations. These are just a few of the innovative and intentional programs you see SB is created to help students thrive wallop and those. Looking ahead many of these programs have been started using one time funding funding sources to ensure these programs remain in place. Thank you for your time and your continued support. Thank you. Thank you [inaudible] Question. All. Have if if yeah. So -- First of all as the in enrollment has have a couple questions on that -- Obviously it's a cavity -- UC system and Santa Barbara. It's just one of you could kind of paint a picture. The the odds of getting in. Now. Versus like ten years ago right and then. You know what's what's the average. GPA. I don't has eighty seven that in that first third -- Well. To officially of the dead it is Barbara at the freshman level and 51% for transfer students. So that means a third of the students who apply will ultimately be admitted to Santa Barbara -- We definitely have become a much more competitive campus -- I would say from the point we were not selected but all. That really has been a hard thing. For the pulp but just. We now have -- Winners we are ranked number. Five Robert or we tried to explain to students that we really should not be considered backup choice campus anymore that. Barb is the big leagues. And determine manned with in the range of thirteen hundred plus. And so if if your a at communicable transfer student your 50%. Yeah community college transfer student the average -- Will we have our guarantee program. That -- Says of student has sixty transferable units with the three point two and a few courses completed specifically in math and English they're guaranteed admission to UC Santa matter what community college there from no matter what community colleges so if. If people come down here and role at Santa Barbara City College. Work we're gonna go visit them tomorrow yes this do not -- A bit of an that that's out there that your chances are better. I think that the difference would be cancers at Santa Barbara City College are very familiar with the C. S. B. R. departments and our selection process. So students get very good advising from the cancers at Santa Barbara City College but a student at college of the sequoias has an equal chance. Under the guarantee -- So the guarantee isn't the to guarantee that they'll get in to UCAS speed to guarantee they'll get into UC campus no it's a guarantee that they will get into UC Santa Barbara. Six of the UC campuses have campus specific guarantees use you choose one campus you choose one tag with. Solar I'm a student at City College the Santa Barbara City College I have it's I have the the minimum requirements I apply to UCSB and I'm automatically accepted. Or whatever of the six campus. Actually retailing Davis three point two in each each kelp each you see that participated said there own. Criteria for their guarantee we guarantee here's Santa Barbara Santa read point. Two so again if you're at Santa Barbara City College Santa Monica San Diego three point two sixty units -- A transferable math to transfer but to community in Santa Barbara county only represents your enrollment of our transfer enrollment each year show how many students actually apply from city college -- From from Santa Barbara city it's a ballot between nine hundred and a thousand I'd have to pull the data from the most recent years but it's it's actually been declining because Santa Barbara City College is a moment has been declining. Yeah hi on the agenda it says that -- The its it that increased by 30%. Community college transfers but Pressman has gone down right transfer that's one thing too if you look you know. It's all great but for the California's family that we're talking about may times the freshman it's that I Anderson can of coke. And that's that in nineteen two thousand nine there is nineteen thousand fifteen freshman and this year. Nineteen three forty so. Comfortable over three hundred more freshmen and non resident increased. Seven thirty I rob. To that. We get that question quite frequently like like I tried to say our priority is still California 86% of our outreach. That we conduct in the office is California -- There is something called compare favorably that our faculty hold. All the campus is to and that is all students must meet the same academic standards so with the number of applications we have again trying to grow the campus academic profile student is in the application pool. Were evaluating all aspects of their application we do want diversity whether it be geographical with in California whether it be ethnic whether it be national and global we do. Maintain a clear understanding and belief in the region cap of is at 16% we feel like that gives our students -- Great global exposure -- The same time we're also promoting our students to study abroad and bring back that knowledge from their study abroad program so we think predict balance right now favorably we tighten up the law. Last year's and now. Yes specifically it can't be does he have to equal to or better than the California student for them we give me. Thirds yeah. I wanted to ask about the outreach programs are. Big supporter them and again I guess are not called out reaching more in state pap. Like that I'm there are some programs that receive special being called saved up action -- Are to some of our transfer out reach program so that they had a big. Question is that. Twenty years ago student centered ones are like that nay step. Your P. there than very very well there's the school centered once and rats reforming. The schools and Santa three are in a press. Whatever they interpreted the pipeline. That's a lot of work and a lot of money in the students are ones is. A five students who are on the bubble. Any get them closer so you get this is transform. Thousand students but you could maybe hand pick itself. Someone say that's kind of creaming because you're just getting sick people who are just about their what do you. What do you think the worthiness of of those and and what could we do tend? To have especially want. To focused on you know. Diverse city of our of our of our UC system in right and wrong more African American and Latino students right. I think it's a combination of both you know you need a combination of both we were frequently in our out reach encountering phenomenal students with phenomenal GPAs. Of from we a first generation families I had no idea that they would even be competitive they you know you talk to them it's like well I think I'll probably just go to my local community college. Which is not a bad option it's an option I took as a first generation student. But without fully realizing the financial aid that was available to me so the admissions office. Meet thousands of those kinds of stew about great has community college is an option but let's get your application into you see as well and and let's see if we can make that work for you at the same time I think our early out reach programs that are funded. Through the say pet funds -- Are essential to creating that pipeline for the families that just really have no background knowledge of higher education a missile amount and I go way back working with the local program in Santa Barbara called cal soap. And you know cal soap is a program that works with first generation families this state funded. And the immediate out reach offices like mind in close conjunction with those programs so at the same time that we're doing Sir the large scale blanket covering of the state of California we also work very closely with those say pet programs. I think you need both yeah. Okay [inaudible] Thank you. I am curious -- About the call a community college promise program an impact it's had on admissions or maybe it hasn't had an impact -- On the community college side we have seen an and unbelievable statewide enthusiasm for these promise programs a grain unity college -- And we're just trying to identify is some of the anecdotal information that we received it equivalent to what you're all starting to see or is it too early to tell -- Because it hasn't really been adopted -- You know I'm. In a kind of a stronger way at the statewide level starting certainly our community college adversity college has adopted I just wonder if you can speak to that. Yeah I'm definitely starting to see some of the results of that -- I think there are great options for students I am starting to see more still the first choice option as a result of those problems programs. I think that especially. Yeah hi performing community colleges like Santa Barbara City College that also offers honors programs. In conjunction with their promise programs are very enticing families. I can I ask you a question about that comment. From your perspective is it enticing tell all families or a are they are the combination of promise and honors enticing to families that -- Or students that come from families who are not first generation horn right I mean. Right I think as the as you've mentioned -- This demand for you see there's a prestige that goes with you see and families want that prestige and there is a certain set of families. Usually the non of first generation those with college experience and their families that. Typically we're not considering the community colleges before -- And wood. In our outreach efforts sometimes even be a bit offended if we brought up a transfer option and I am now seeing. Those families locally looking at last of the again I also see that first generation family who often things that's their only option and again it's a great option if they've done all the research and determine that's the best that school for them. I just too often see students assume that the four year universities are not an option and I I like to know courage students to explore at all. Thank you does that answer your question it does yeah. And and all for a view spoke at the end. Of the and consistent funded and I higher at ninety eight the community colleges benefit to some extent of from prop ninety eight but certainly not. For your schools so while we are interested and I think recession through. To the start of a real That's right. I'm for higher and what is that look like is in no viable is it not. What other elements it? Would you have us think about that's not funding related in terms of the legislature and direction to support the student from out reach to admissions to enrollment to graduation. And beyond. Besides funding [inaudible] Thanks Hyundai [inaudible] It. And it's one we grab. Well I would I would say yeah just. More conversations like this I think are incredibly valuable for instance the two to one ratio I completely understand that I'm a product like I said of the community college and it was a good start for me -- But it also when were trying to get very creative with our outreach efforts and we're trying to reach as many students as possible. Sometimes being bound to such a restrictive policy with zero wiggle room for instance that two to one is is is an exact count. Of the ratio we must maintain. And so sometimes like we were all and so we are. Doing all these special efforts just to make sure we get those last ten students enrolled. That's taking up an enormous amount of time and resources so I would also say sometimes a little bit more flexibility in understanding the challenges of the work that we're doing -- Would go a long way in allowing us to do really what we think is best for the students. I think one thing that I would add is is just taking advantage of the programs that currently exists so right now the California student aid commission will reach out. To cal grant recipients letting them know that they qualify for the conference program. Couldn't we somehow have those instead of having students have to to apply for the conference program just create a pipeline and automatically connect them with the resources on my bill idea this between eighteen are. Worth thinking about. Yeah. And I would can I just add one thing and at the goes back to senator Jackson's question. I'm about how we measure things. On the kinds of metrics that you all look for and think about when we indicate what success looks like I think building on leases response having conversations about what success looks like some what those metrics look like together. Can really help us all understand each other. And bill programs that are more sustainable as well. You know one of the things that I think has been sort of governor of brown's whole approaches graduation -- You once graduation numbers doesn't necessarily demonstrate that someone actually has gotten a quality education. The graduated -- There's got to be a happy medium somewhere in between where we can judge the quality of that education as well as their graduation. And maybe that's because here with you -- Because I still believe that the goal of education is to teach people how to think critically. Not necessarily just to get a job -- It and perhaps the answers again somewhere in the middle there -- The notion you have to scramble to meet your two to one ratio of courses frustrating -- On the other hand what we see is a legislature is sometimes people really start fudging the numbers and taking advantage of some of that flexibility so. Maybe that somewhere to where we could find that happy medium. As far as the graduation I don't want to diminish. What you said? But in not much at that so much at the UC but say really that's a CSU issue but still the UC if. The more students who graduated at and I wanna go over this three point nine years. For your freshman and are. Nine three nine four replace all that still that's pretty remarkable and I think it's lower than -- C. S. look most UC's and you know now we have. Students who get the Pell grant in the summer is. That that's just. The graduate is for a pair of time. It's more access for other students treat try to get in so -- One thing that's kind of been frustrating. For many years this. Is like someone saying earlier that here in the summer. Mister Haynes was saying that is to say did campus and in the have the buildings and it's everything's here so. How do we better utilize -- The facilities year round. That's been that's been a topic that's been going on for decades yeah. Well. I think it's changes it's changing and we actually have a number of very innovative summer programs about that how are getting more students well our office of our office of summer sessions and is very entrepreneurial actually has worked in collaboration with many of our other offices. Whatever continuing education is now called which I forgotten -- They just change the name but they've got a number of really really innovative programs that are joint programs -- In sort of academic slash professional programs -- Journalism a public advocacy is one programs like that that are going on in the summer we also have a number very innovative -- Bridge programs for students so we have a freshman summer star program that runs in our seconds. Second major summer sessions about six weeks before the fall quarter starts. That's really really booming and it's an excellent transition programs the data show that students who start in that program especially under represented students. Really do remarkably well I'm coming in the fall quarter I mean all of our students where the American please I know that. Housing that a crunch and housing is empty housing is the biggest for free right there your I'm camps are doing stuff like that in -- My soft ASEAN is also doing a lot with online courses for students who can't afford to stay in the summer you go home and work or family connections so that our summers actually doing a lot of online yeah. And Mike's office as a new program to fought a support students who to staying cam thousand during the summer right we we've been trying to expand -- Funding options for students to be able to it the young not only attend so if they attend full time and they're they're taking at least twelve units will pay So is that is that three point nine four because the students. Start as a freshman taken a much of course isn't that they already have a semester done or is it because they're taking more than fifteen person master. Yes summer summer yes a combination. Of yeah. A lot of the APA college level courses summer courses the freshmen summer start it's a very very common now to see a student who. Enters as a freshman. Actually have enough units to be sophomores and even juniors were seen an increase in the number of high school students have already completed their general education course. For students are looking for ways to shave off costs graduating early is one yeah definitely. Well I was thinking you know of the to get that final credit taking underwater basket weaving I mean that's yeah. That's not quite what we're trying to accomplish but no and actually I don't think that's what. They're doing so much my date maybe so but no we're seen students think very strategically students are very outcome focus so regardless of their major. For instance they might be -- A science student who wants to add a minor in professional writing because they you know think we'll and then and you know how to write grant so I'm going to add the minor in professional rite aid -- So students [inaudible] Well [inaudible] State. You could say a fifty year because fees were affordable now students are looking for ways. To graduate early or if they're going to stay the four full years and maybe a quarter more. It needs to be because they're supplementing their resume with -- A study abroad with a and experience will program that is going to make them more marketable and increasingly were creating programs that build in that kind of experience for students even in that sort of more traditional quote unquote liberal arts education. In my day students tried to stay in school for five years to avoid the draft. I don't know if anybody remembers anyone here was of that era but now students to trying to graduate early moment their their viability in the workforce. Strategic via an on that topic I actually want to follow up at the center and I just came from a hearing related to natural disaster response. And it's certainly -- Very important issue -- At the state level and one of the things that has come up has been. What's the role of our research institutions -- In helping us address I mean. Something that's so big that all the experts are. Still struggling to figure out what we do about the wild fires and as I hear these conversations about -- Students -- Bean outcome driven I mean certainly I worked here in the term time to degree matter to last. I think about the senator's comment related to we also want them to be critical thinkers -- In in my case at I I have a special place for undergraduate research on and research altogether and wanting students to yes get these degrees and get very practical -- Skills that will help them certainly as we tackle monster issues we need the critical thinkers we need the researchers to help us tackle problems that are. Bigger than us right now -- Can you speak to some trends that you're seen around -- Students I mean are they still getting these experiences is that an area where we are doing a good job of investing maybe not doing as great of a job investing because that is so key to the state of California. Effect yes so we just are in the process of reviewing undergraduate research and creative activities grant so that's one of the major undergraduate research programs in the college of letters and science on our application numbers or up hugely this year like by. Twenty or 30% -- And so that's are at the program where students conduct independent research we also have a program a sort of gateway programmer students work with faculty. List research in a directory also up twenty or 30% so we know that undergraduates are keenly interested in that research experience and we know how important that research experience is as you. I'm for real. Helping students to not just. Around important issues. Yet undergraduate research has always been a key feature of the UCSB education -- My role as associate vice chancellor Frederick education is sort of a new role in creating this office of undergraduate education but I the the to sort of keep things that we're creating as capstone for students with undergraduate research is an on campus experience and then. Study abroad is you know you see SB use education abroad as always but I also queued spirit here. But we're making maybe keep capstone experiences for students video if you look at brochures you see edges in read. Which is heavily. Mode probably the most request. And at those reached. But the chancellor has let all these years is what is it the opportunities to get involved in research we are seeing a lot more students coming to the university from. International Baccalaureate programs I'd be programs where critical thinking. Is pushed dramatically in students start getting research experience in high school and they're looking for that experience when they get to the university one of the things we talk to students who have a lot of those Advanced Placement units and I'd be on at some. College credits before they come is what that's going to allow you to do is get involved in out reach lighten your schedule a little bit to allow more time. For those experience of programs for outreach so our skis me for research so. We start talking about research the point that we are recruiting this student you'll see information about the McNair scholars programs in our email campaigns that we sent to students. We try to use McNair scholars for instance -- In our student profiles of success -- That we highlight and all of our informational brochures we also I just will add to have programs that help students develop to become undergraduate researchers McNair is a kind of capstone experience but those early gateway programs are so important. Because they help students learn to do that and faculty are very very invest in those programs as well. Thank you 5% 55% yes yes 55% of undergrad actually. You. Thank you so much will now proceed with our our final panel. Last but not least of course is our faculty and students. Perspective. Seven other students go first [inaudible] Okay -- Hi there my name's modeling laden occurs on a thank you -- For coming here to the campus it's a lot easier that you're here rather than us tracking you down. Yes but I am a thirty year history of public policy major at UCSB -- And I've had the opportunity to where thirty year and work where you work and I came here -- Nobody had a conversation with me about what the UC's are actually like and so when I came here the reality was very different from what I was told about with you see could offer me -- I found myself organizing for for students that don't have housing they don't have food I'm trying to fight for it some funding for sexual assault resources on our campus -- Issues that I didn't think we're going to be this prevalent in US state funded institution that I grew up hearing that -- Was one of the best in the world. And so that was first very startling for me and then the long that I went into it another interesting thing that I learned was disparities between the UC campuses -- That was a concept that never had occurred to me before that there could be a campus like you see more sad -- Not like so many basic resources -- Compared so UC Berkeley that has been here for a long time but the students both. Of you know. This is of our kids a six infinitely plate. So that was really -- Israel. All the students protesting at Berkeley and on our campuses were actually trying to yell really loudly because people work during that -- And that they've been in the situation for a long time and that we've had a breaking point where -- You see students and and it's something that I'm really passionate about. So something that I find you need about the nineteen sixty California hired master plan beyond -- The creation of a really unique higher public education system is that how the authors and legislators and higher education leaders -- And it. Of a lot of pressure due to a president population growth still maintain the idea that higher education needs to be affordable -- And so I think that was a really unique idea for the time and I think that there's a lot of parallels but we're experiencing now. And I understand that we have a huge population pressure on a sound number in very different circumstances. But I also understand that the situation where an especially with increased funding in our state is a policy choice -- And it's a policy choice that students aren't really going to put up with anymore and I think that's been very evident over the past couple of years -- And beyond that to the the nineteen sixty eight I California of higher education plan. Really only pave the way for a type of education Ford students that our state actually saw getting higher education at the time. That means we're still relying on a system that over prioritizes white students can be schools -- A system that was heralded for it's time and still today for the opportunities that it created but Dodd. Disproportionately created on for five very small portion of our state -- And it's still being represented on every single one of our campuses. So -- These even very interesting cation works not just at the UC's but in California. In general -- And seeing as this conversation is more focus on you see SB there are some issues that I want to point out that idea and I have experienced every time here that I work with a lot of students about -- One of the issues that we have been made of aware of this year is a lack of funding for undocumented student resources on a campus. So as I'm sure you're aware the C. office of the president -- Is not going to renew the funding sources that they're getting. And study there having that job done the chances to fundraise UCSB receives the least amount of money for are undocumented Ste bursting services and we also have the lowest amount. And as I'm sure that's proportional -- As I'm sure that's proportional that's still not adequate we should be and rolling a lot of undocumented students we should be making sure that the students. Are not going to have to fight for resources from their chance are for funding but they should be like actually being taken care by the state the state needs to fight for all the students that our public system. Thankless undocumented students that also includes non resident students -- As I read in this. In this agenda back up 16% -- Of UCSB is population that's a huge portion and the students are carrying a huge load -- On their shoulders to pay for this institution that we shouldn't necessarily have to pay for it. And I tuition is making up such a large portion. Of of the California -- Of the funding and a huge percentage that is coming from non resident students were being punished solely because they're from a different state but really really respect institution that they're going. To and that. As I know personally from a lot of my out of state students are really dedicated to staying in California and getting a job here -- And working in these can be is that we've all learned to love. So beyond that there's issues such as mental health services are caps here only has five concerts for sexual assault -- Survive use we also they as I recently got information from that only plan to see if forty people per day there now currently sing seventy people per day -- There are a lot of instances in the UC's when people have spoken to the concert and said this is a dire emergency and they have been told to wait two weeks. I'm not to help dire emergency is what it is that is an emergency -- And we are at this institution and the situations that were in because of a lack of funding are contributing to increasing mental health issues. And that's a true that just needs to be spoken on it needs to be addressed and a lot of students I mean I mean I come in incline [inaudible] Missing -- I think it's hard as a student Just. And is not a true that were told me calm and a lot of kids come here and they face really severe basic needs issues as well -- In this reality and and it's interesting having these conversations about how best to remediate the situation that were put in -- With people that have the ability to change it so -- I would just like to remind you all that again this is a policy choice I understand there are a lot of different factors playing into it and is a unique relationship between the UC and the state -- But as we saw last year through a lot of our students lobbying efforts and in the funding that we got from the state -- There's really who really an important need to look past that and address the real issue -- And really look at the students and like how we can benefit the state. And also in a very humane level think about the situation that they're trying to live through just to receive an education. Thank you thank you. K. -- Good afternoon Assemblymembers thank you for having me here. My name is combine our state which a cook when I'm of what their politicized major diverse a cop points out Barbara. I'm also the vibration where you from it unless riverside versus seven thousand is a kind of moved around a lot. It's almost the bottom tropical is for Betty C. which is to run activists group here at base and hours campus. Now less of the goals for but you see actually push for a bill to extend the coverage summer maybe there are. Fifty three now fortunately all bill failed. But in the process after consulting là about to look at some of the people involved in decided to bring it back. And so we reached out to use as a it was a California association would need a partnership with them. And of also reached out to the constitution association percent What that means is that per UC's to that's a fifty thousand dollar drop in thirty years? See you do that's eleven thousand dollar drop. What hasn't up in the process is the need for college graduates? And or the same public policy is to California would have a college graduate of sort of one point one billion but you're twenty third. And that's all the more conservative estimates I believe this difficult to access has the number on two million. Not in spite of this California's I'd give systems are still not graduating enough to is on time. So now in this process also door trivialize what the she's been because we are very much aware that the UC is leading a lot of situations in graduate instance of color. And they should be commended applauded for that. But even here at the you see if we compare pocket recipients to non public recipients and use improper as a indication of income status we know they're not progress if it's a graduated rate of 7% of for years. Whereas question Reyes and black and brown powder recipients are graduating rates below 50% of the accidents about 40% for browsers around 46%. And the reason I bring up these where graduation rate is because these institutions are market to us as for institutions so we're not to look at the six a graduation rates were injured in the for you because that's how it was sold to us will be applied. Now this is the system we know that the numbers even what does Wall. Whether the entices you that also universes of operation there for you graduation rates aren't around 25%. Which is pretty sad. We will push for expanding access to financial aid because when a send up the a currently people low income students we still don't have access based on how the was the set up of financial aid in California. Will also push for legislation that understands that it's not enough just look at tuition fees which need to look at the entire total cost of attendance. Because they've been such as housing and text books that are making higher education a barmaid good based on income. Now do you governor legislator what we're hoping is that. He always damp us. For the sole reason that we are definitely going to come back with everything to bring these issues up or pay to fight up until a couple legislator. Remembers that when you invest in students invest in the future California politically and economically. Well the question to you all as we all sat with us I hope you have that is yes and I like to thank you for having Thank you -- Good afternoon that term McCarty and assemblymember the moment senator Jackson's -- My name in shining bone I'm professor of economics and chair of the UC Santa Barbara economic sent. A check to the first four time coming to send a private. Here right here. Yup. Speak on the fact. The of my colleagues -- Made a long term commitment to the campus the university and and the state of California. To start that pitted chime in with the students and and and we're proud to be probably the best public university system in in the world based on the you know master plan and and the the build up of the and the system. We have high standards on what we think what it takes to give students a first rate education and we want to give students a first rate education. In. Given that we're were greatly disappointed by that the downward trend in state funding -- You know when app in enough relative and per capita relative to the state budget and whatever and measure you want to take. You know looking back over the twenty five years that I've been here that we've gotten whacked -- In every recession should be here gotten severe budget cuts and in every downturn we have failed to get comparable budget Gaines to reinstate the cuts that were there for me before. And frankly I am a little bit afraid that we are keeping up with the trend as you expressed concerns about a possible recession come forward. We still have not recovered from the two thousand eight cuts despite couple years of you know moderate -- Funding increases but let me focus on Santa Barbara and see few things about our campus -- Comment on that the presentations made or Brough lords campus and in proud of it -- We're focused on giving students a top quality education and and a broad range of disciplines in the humanities and the sciences and engineering. And we don't really have a lot of professional schools the only one we have is focused on the environment and that's I think very telling it's it's a focus. Of research across a lot of the disciplines but that makes us more dependent on state support than many other campuses and so we're always hoping that our efforts are appreciated and in Sacramento and we're hoping for your support there. And we also feel like we're willing to the new campus and we're growing we're getting better so despite. You know all the obstacles at our trajectory as is up and we're basically optimistic about our capabilities -- If we get the at least decent funding on the research side -- Reputation is planning a licensing the chancellor explained at some of that. Our research funding is now almost equal to our entire state funding and that's that's at the British significant. On the teaching side we're becoming both more diverse and more selective. I mean diversity and inclusion are are obviously core values. There's student email. We're also doing own fundraiser in in the quarter areas of you know funding for classrooms teaching labs -- Maintenance other core support that's that's a challenge for which we need -- Some support. Now that turned perhaps most important the purpose of this -- Hearing. We have pretty good relations between the faculty and the university administration and you see in in general. Is known for the principle of shared gov and switch allows faculty to work through the academic Senate to participate in -- Universal decision making and I'm pleased to see that you're UC Santa Barbara shared governance is is working really well and I'm. Credit our chancellor for making a point of consulting faculty and other campus groups. On on important issues and setting the right tone and as you know the chancellor has made a long term commitment like many of the faculty to this. Campus which is confidence inspiring in the shared governance it to some of the needs me on to to comment on the presentations by the by the chancellor's. And nine others. Most of what they said is really not news to read -- Pretty broadly with that and I'd like to make that and be that understood as a as a you know endorsement off the the issues we've heard. The you know struggling with the rise and often a problem and what -- Enormous. Certainly strongly supportive off and capital projects and I I was delighted by your comments -- Term McCarthy about a potential on the ship that would help us greatly that came to friction For then at if you. Faculty concern as granted students faculty renewal and and and quality control. Granted students specially PhD students are really central to research university. And we're really troubled by the slipping sheer graduate students at UC Santa Barbara when we formulated a long range academic plan about fifteen years ago the act graduate student share was plan was to raise that share In in that area instant the shares declined 211% and and that's really disturbing. It hurts so ability to teach undergraduates because the PhD student service key ace. In hurt so intelligent to previous research because to PhD students are also that research is as it. Should be -- Because teaching advanced topics are simply impossible blessed instructors on the edge of research in their respective fields and the PhD students are really at the center of that. Second one of my medicine on faculty renewal. Many of our faculty here and there in in their fifties and sixties and many of us love our job so much at least -- Stay way longer than its financially attractive but eventually people retire. And at that's a problem because the university has really taken a systematic advantage off -- Faculty members loyalty it's well known that long serving faculty -- Often except below market salaries without immediately threatening to move. And think it's we sort of get used to buildings falling to disappear com on this we pay in equities credit [inaudible] And the space for them to come and feel comfortable in into space. So -- Units because economist paying below market salaries in deferring maintenance is a great short term strategy for for saving money. But it's really not a sustainable solution and we're concerned about faculty renewal and needing more attention. Going forward most one is better quality control and and specifically that the principle of of peer review. At this is worth emphasizing giving this you know growth and reporting requirements fed beef experience over many years and I would have to say I have no problem with and accountability provided those to ask us for data also. You know pay for the staff to provide all those data which is a source of growth and in in staffing. But the point one make is that as far as I can tell the quantitative matrix really don't to the heart of how the university works. To keep principle years peer review when we produce research. Is not recognized until validated by independent reviews and we apply the same principle to teaching it to the organization of the universities for shared governance. In every course has course evaluation each faculty member is revealed every at least every five years typically. Two and a two or three every department is regularly reviewed by outside experts that examine the quality instruction quality of research quality of the curriculum. And those reviews look at metrics non commercial aspects of quality and so the the great strength of peer review. Is that combines measurement but good judgment and the message that I'm trying. To say is that I messed. For called guy. Benchmarks Richard roles like the two to one ratio for freshman transfers that burger ever mentioned. And we believe we believe for a truck that we need sort of deserve some trust because we have a fairly deeply. Ingrained culture of peer review and shared governance. And that provides a much more rigorous quality control that anybody could and maple is found that from challenges and and ask for your support. All we really need is stable and reasonable funding level in a measure of trust that lived through such funding appropriately. And we will. Thank you enough. Printer answer questions. Thank you I have a few questions and comments -- Back -- In the day is the state of California I think put in fifty eight cents. Of every dollar the university spent we're now down who is it seventeen or eighteen sense. So we really have lost that commitment the university California used to be free -- That was the commitment that anyone who could. Qualify I would get a free education because they do bring. Your comments absolutely accurate. Most of the students who go to university California want to stay here in California and most of are you see SB grads want to stay here I mean they're smart. Who I just came from Chicago in a snowstorm who once lived through their life's too short? So -- Part of it is that we've lost sense. But that being said. We are trying to identify our our neediest students and provide as much funding as possible and I do know I don't know the exact numbers here you UCSB. The number of students who get Pell grants and cal grant St god only knows what all there is but when you work with students and and help them. Most most of the students who needed don't pay tuition. But they do have to pay for living expenses so. I'm not sure why where the university can come in and and I'm. I'm trying to respond to your I think very eloquent and and accurate concerns about. It getting education here how how do we how do we do that on eighteen cents to the dollar -- Versus fifty eight cents to the dollar which we used to do I think it was back in the sixties -- So. The the you know funding I mean there's a movement right now frankly that I disapprove. A intensely in privatizing all of education. We're saying that University Michigan comes to mind I think that schools basically been privatized -- I think it's a foolhardy effort and a bad. One but we've done a little bit of that here in. In California so. I I think one of the questions that I had -- In this whole discussion and by the way I do want to agree with you mental health services are completely inadequate I put money in our budget. As a member that the sub committee I think was a a twenty five million dollars which would put money in for each of the UC's to start dealing with some of the mental health issues were saying. With our students in the governor took it out we have new governor coming in he said higher education is a priority of his and I'm hoping. This will be one of those -- Priorities -- I do agree if we gray in the summer that was one of the things I was told there the cost of a of a unit is higher in the summer. No funding available who the heck's going to take advantage of but the that you made a statement that were over prioritizing white students. So I'd like you to clarify that a little bit for me particularly in light of the statements that we heard here how we're doing out reach out we're getting a a pretty significant number of underserved. Students 40% or the first my family to graduate nor making efforts but could you explain to me what you. What you mean by over prioritizing white students Yeah. To say is. I'm thirty and I think it's white -- Other. But representative of what California is -- And I think it's a simple as that [inaudible] Well. Okay what percentage of California it is white. I have no idea I'm. Well the reason I ask is that I think we are we are certainly a minority majority stake minority up within quotes. So that the state is comprised more of a communities of color but I'm I'm. I'm not sure the 31% isn't over -- Reflection of the white population which is why I assets under -- I would think is we can talk about when we talk about hard has and let's look at Lassen specifically because eyes to all the service president PS you pleasure. And all these which we saw as for the longest time our statistics were blaster publishers around what would hover between 2% 3% even though we know that and then the technician whiner là yeah 30% by being up with there. And so we knew that -- Pretty much and therefore in the state of California it's aye these are five selections but even with the blasters who work here. There was a person of us was there so I think the has been somewhat of a push to create more programs to incorporate lessons but it will look at the service of what actual license were saying here. Some of those things are very does with the like I don't like up in my county some things that happen on my campus does. It make you feel like an outsider there's a lot of stories about that and so is efforts to like try and put -- I noticed it was a trying to Lassen on missions right now what would be issue too great a mentorship program. Which takes students were license here won't be here for awhile and mentor them. And because part of the reason is that's when that program was created by blacks was actually because we saw that allows it to become if they don't have that connects to a community. And so this is. It is a bit of a problem it is actually quite a major problem because this is a bet on one situation where somebody said it's like their first I'm just being from here. And so having no sense of community having those it's a connection to people look like you. That becomes an entire problem and if your first and Reyes and you haven't been access these resources I give a talk at the Mike action is the promise of our program. Bombs go program actually put a lot of black students two years ago -- The procession work with them over summer. And what it is which we noticed about the promise of our program is that the reason why the big you for a long time there was a blind spot in universities ought not realizing that. These dessert institutional knowledge that by not being from that family which has led to some go to college actually lackey. At and I don't disagree with you I in fact I think you're absolutely correct and that's been my understanding -- Particularly with African American students on campus. The statement. Our ties. Students I'd like some. What that means? I'm not getting. The concept is cut and I agree that we have not been and one of things we try to do is wrap around services for first generation students -- You know whose families don't have a history that they're not able to land the kind of support that's necessary I get that but how are we over prioritizing white students. So in saying that it's not necessarily something that so over it -- As I think it used to be and higher education systems whether it's through admissions up and it's been a lot of efforts to remediate it but it's it's evident through -- A lack of funding for even on to resources -- For things that a lot of students from white families are like what stands -- Hive economically like. Better situations instance of color on a campus and the state and the universities and ability to acknowledge how that has a significant impact on their ability to succeed here -- I think. Is we are trying to create opportunities for them to come. And so there are efforts -- To encourage look that -- Motions of color comes our campus and that they state their graduation -- I do think that it is a disservice to students of color that were not acting as fast as we should on that we're not debate reading enough resources to these programs -- And it's beyond recruitment and retention it's down to basic needs programs it's down to the mental health programs it's down -- To recruiting motions of color for our graduate school -- Stuff like that so while it's not and maybe that covered that state and I said can to receive be perceived as a little. Boy and I I do think that it is a situation that is that dire our public higher education system should be a system in which we can help alleviate the disparities between people of color and white people in the state of California -- And I just think that it can do better and I wanted to do better. Than it already is and I think part of it starts before college coming Ted definitely so. So I appreciate that because yeah. I I hear what you're saying I'm not not taking to consider what the injures in the new and who are first generation color who haven't the same opportunities -- Because of family. Comes sizzle. The general fund is associated. Education we don't need as much okay. As we do perhaps in some of our from middle class white community site I get that I agree with that. It's it justice to say were over prioritizing white students I think is. It moves me sort of in a focus and I'm not sure I understand. Thank you and I think it's important to let me -- Interjected appreciate back in the back and forth is if you look at higher and in general -- Which but your point earlier center Jackson's rise how much California used to invest in higher ed. That's when they California educate hired system UC and CSU. Was very very Caucasian and now an era I think this the FAA from the CSU system prospecting last year talk. The overall deal as the as the university system is getting more brown the state commitment to higher ed is going down. Trying to make a rhyme there but that that I think that is the is the picture that that we have to always realize is that in California at higher education funding -- That's it that's reality but but back -- To I appreciate you letting that the student perspective. And I I do think it is important some of things that we're grappling with. Is is -- If we had to sit cases here of let's say a billion dollars. Right. So for UC and CSU you could take that improperly fund. And I know UC's use you're asking for five hundred million of pieces for their budget and that's we should ask because we need. But you can you can -- Stop the UC system pay for compensation pay for deferred maintenance the basic. Needs -- Do debt load housing hunger. Food security the whole works and so you could have the other suit billion dollar suitcase. And it reactive reinvested in financial late which is what. We've been trying to the assembly last couple years basically -- Expand the cal grant give you an add on cal grant to not just you tuition but help pay for your cost of living your Bucks transportation housing and so forth and you know that's that's our job that's what the budget subcommittee do is. Grapple with these scarce resources that compete with health care and early education and child care and pre school and after school programs in the works and and you know that's our problem but you your job is to we 100% understand that and I appreciate you. Letting that perspective and you know we're gonna get back out of twenty nineteen and I think there is. There's an opportunity we have that at the new governor as as was mentioned to campaign heavily on higher education -- We have a little bit of new -- Increase revenue and in the twenty eighteen twenty nineteen budgets [inaudible] There is [inaudible] Find. From you know early cation through K. twelve th hired because we're not you know. Funding what we need as far as the outcome you know. You'd be here -- You know what word just -- Under achieving as far as as far as that -- So I just want to thank you for sharing your perspective as far as the the fact that seven one I appreciate your respect as well just one comment it's it's a big interested. Of the legislature as far as the faculty in diverse you know you you mentioned that. We teach I could see. Baby boomers retiring and as we as a replace these -- These positions it's really important that we we work hard to try to have people that reflect the students not just it's morally right but in a research shows that students. Do better when they have faculty members that reflect the community so. That set a top priority of I know that is chairman Mr team this is one of his top higher and priorities and we've been working on this for the last few years. Continue do so. That is that's definitely a priority for us state that peak issue for us there is one the the size of the pipeline off -- You know graduate students PhD students who are ready to take faculty positions. And the tremendous competition with with other distributions -- And for the pipeline I'm getting back to graduate students if we you know fund -- Graduate students PhD students that around the state UC has has been the pipeline so the more you know diverse students and graduate students weekend. The more be built the pipeline. In of the faculty positions it's it's really tough. On my own department economics here -- Actually benefitted from the you know state funding for faculty diversity that -- Was provided to us a year ago. We we competed for that for the first year we didn't get it and do you think campus actually provided funds on their own resources to support as a little bit. And last year we got -- Got funding add that that helped us we also hand and you know in don't cheer an awful cheers to one of those for for fundraising. At now -- Experiences being we have scrounging around we have for look at all the further north told year old enough every single person and trying to see if that person must move all what it would take to move the person -- We did that three years ago scanned entire market -- You know made made an offer I think made to offers but all we did was raise their salaries at their home institution recession as we're making an offer their family back and counter offer. That's the reality -- Last year we were we were more successful -- We got for the state funding we got -- One M. Hispanic school young can attrition -- Who got -- First of that apple stock for a year which expenses at his tenure clock -- Witness the state funding and then he's he's -- On board as a faculty member -- Me also hired if it female faculty member -- That for that -- With with that supports and went all out and then in the process -- In turn funds to get some seek funding for a center and that's the kind of support that it takes to hire minority faculty diversifying. Eight in the tree stream a competitive market yeah we had a three hour hearing on this. Three weeks ago so -- We we we we know it's it's that it is complicated but was the one that. You know make it a priority summer we're we're clear committed to doing that we are fully committed to doing that. Thank you aye a pre shape the perspective they appreciate the advocacy certainly I started as a student activists at the UC. And my college friends don't understand how I ended up working for the UC for eleven years -- The and that is so I appreciate the role and a think as chair McCarty said at Daddy's your role to be advocates in to be a vocal about -- You know the issues and imperfections we see in the system. There was a comment made around decrease if not a de funding and support to and documented students and I'm hoping that someone could please clarify. What that means -- And I don't. Is there a program that went away was that from cut coming from you see office of the president. I can provide and I don't think we can ask the the in the UC office the president that represented here maybe they can might not. Thank you term McCarty say ever attended university of California office of the president -- We currently have funding from documents student programs for eighteen nineteen that husband. That was set as a three year funding that ends in eighteen nineteen that has not yet been extended because it's funded out of the UC -- Piece budget. The region to any written up OP budget around may of twenty nineteen so this coming spring. Would be when the region's approved the potential extensions but we haven't unfunded anything. It's just we haven't yet. Actively approved the next cycle of funding. That's done by the region's that is done by the region discerning indication that that's going to be a problem going forward. The regions are highly supportive of undocumented students okay services. Thank you for the flag it for and so on the record we support that. And I know the regions that are urging have have look to look at other pots of money you see why to prioritize. Statewide priorities and and this is one that we have with that. That talked about so. Okay thank you okay. Thank you for that for the presentation I believe we we now have the opportunity if anybody. In your three hours now but if anybody. Would like to speak -- Is our public comment sections of there is anybody. Please -- Plan F. right here. I'm reading a prepared statement greater everybody my name's Johnson good for those who don't know me. I service vice president the board of trustees for some of the City College but I'm here representing the re claim California hard to cation coalition which is. A coalition of unions fact two groups and student groups across all three segments marvelous comments I think. Yeah I was a student leader they get better every year self at this their GPAs are rising but that because he's I think rising even more -- So first I want to say thank you for hosting I think it's very interesting to do a deep dive on a campus specific instead of on the system why because you know each campus is different -- I want to thank you all for what you've done to find higher education the state of California thing you know you three specifically have been very strong advocates. And yeah I think we all believe that. A higher education is the single best social mobilize are available to us as a society to move people up. Six years ago the state fully funded the university and there was no tuition. With only incidental fees. Today individual students and families are being given the responsibility of funding the university rather than the public at large at UCSB were saying it's at a two to one ratio the system wide COR funds are about almost. Fifty fifty coming from of the state or from tuition. On top of that. They're paying more while receiving less per student funding been compared to the year two thousand in the year. Nineteen eighty five while seats are you know being allocated to tied to state students to help make up for those budget shortfalls. Further this overall reduction state support happened gradually ask camps did become less white and more diverse and as our prison populations grew and funding was diverted in that direction. The result has been an unprecedented to because even if you get a cal grant to pay for your entire tuition which I did not be tuition for four years. I still ended up with twenty thousand dollars in debt because you need to pay for the cost of living still. And it's difficult even measure how many people are self selected out of the system because they were data verse or that they were shocked by the sticker price as was mentioned -- Even if you know your come from alone can background I did. A lot of my friends in end up going because it costs too much wasn't for them. It's often said that it's way too expensive to return to tuition free college or to restore quality in person funding. Or to expand access in fully fund each new student into the university or to provide robust financial aid for cost of living expenses. To do them all would seem you know impossible. We are here to say that it will actually cost fifteen million dollars if you include the six billion required for pop ninety eight you know fall new revenue. I which translates 250% of taxpayers paying a tax of sixty six dollars a year or less -- To find this. To fund this budget at that rate [inaudible] The without. To restoring per student funding. Repurpose in financial aid to cover costs of living expenses. And to expand seats available. We're also looking at metrics to correspond with that such a large increase in public funding. But all could be done for a relatively affordable price to the individual and a tax form of financing inside of a tuition former financing which you know we we feel that tuition is in fact. A tax on those who choose to go to college. This would be a line the university back into becoming a true public good rather than individual endeavor. This would and this in depth that crisis along Badgett its graduates all of them not just the rich ones to start their lives after college without that because right now. Most of us graduate with that -- And then we will be able to spend our money in the local economy instead of sending it to Pennsylvania which is where my three hundred dollars a month goes -- We went up and down the state the past two years as the coalition raising awareness building support and taking feedback on our idea and plan. And we have found resounding support. From organizations of all kinds. We look for our coalition goal is to finalize the bill a place holder and first week of January for introduction in the next session. That encompasses the tenants I've described we look forward to working with this committee the Senate and other partners in the coming months to reclaim the promise of the master plan. Set in nineteen sixty rate in in one year on a typewriter -- For the twenty first century now moving forward. We want to end by saying that in the last session the legislature and the governor. You know accumulated the votes and passed the gas tax. Like that to address a dire need that I I do support that and we do support that. Are we prepared to do the same for the dire need in higher education right now. Thank you [inaudible] Thank you. Okay thing nobody else. That -- Asking clues are hearing this afternoon thanks again to the participants and thank you to the UC Santa Barbara Thank you
