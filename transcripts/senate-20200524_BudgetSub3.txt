BUT FOR IT YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT- AS WE'RE GETTING FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- IF THEY'RE COVERING THE MAXIMUM 75% WE STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND THE REMAINING. 25% AND CERTAINLY- I THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN APPROPRIATELY ALLOCATE OUR STATE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS THECODE- PANDEMIC BUT ALSO OF COURSE- PRIORITIZE THAT VARIOUS OTHER. EXPENDITURES THAT WERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS WELL SO- YEAH I THINK HAVING THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION AND- GAUGE MEN CERTAINLY NOT ONLY ON HIMSELF ON A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL.

SOME BACKGROUND- THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCLUDED ONE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS. IN THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED THE SONG BROWN GENERAL FUND. THIRTY THREE MILLION TO CONTINUE. IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS MAY REVISE PROPOSES TO DISCONTINUE THIS EXPANSION OF THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM. AS A RESULT THE SONG BROWN'S LANDING WILL CONTINUE WITH ITS HISTORIC BASELINE BUDGET. I JUST NOTE IF FEDERAL FUNDING INTEREST IS RECEIVED THIS PROGRAM IS TO BE RECONSIDERED FOR GENERAL FUNDS OR- FISCAL NINETEEN TWENTY AWARDS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THESE CONTRACTS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EXECUTED OR HAPPEN IT'S CUTE.

THOUGH IN RECENT YEARS OSCAR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS UP AND PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH SPECIAL SIGNS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ADMINISTRATION. BUT THE EXISTING SONG RUN PROGRAM AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS WE KNOW THAT BOTH PRIMARY CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS PROGRAMS ARE. EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF COMMON NINETEEN- YOU'RE NOT THE ONE TIME GENERAL PLAN FUNDING FOR SONG BROWN IS SET TO EXPIRE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED TO MAKE THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT ON GOING THERE BY EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. HOWEVER IN LIGHT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER OUR BROAD POLICY TO PULL BACK PROPOSED EXPANSIONS WHILE MAINTAINING WHERE POSSIBLE THE EXISTING COMMITMENTS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE PROPOSE TO HOLD BACK THE EXPANSION FROM THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM WHILE MAINTAINING THE EXISTING FUNDING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. ABOUT CULMINATES IN A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AT THE END OF TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND UNLIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAM ONE TIME INVESTMENT. FULLY BACKED EXPANSION OF SONG BROWN WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND WE ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM HAS EXISTING BASE FUNDING. FROM THE ENACTED- TRUMP IS AN ACT ON HEALTH FACILITIES AS OSCAR. HAS PREVIOUSLY NOTED YOU. THERE IS ANOTHER. SPECIFIC TO WHAT TERMS ARE THE INDUSTRY TENTS REPAIR LOAN THE HOSPITAL. FOR AND WILL THE INDUSTRY RESPONSE. IF THE PROGRAM MEETS FIND LET ME REVISE PROPOSES A ONE TIME TRANSFER OF FORTY MILLION. FROM THE HOSPITAL BUILDING FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND. WE UNDERSTAND THE SPECIALFUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT SCIENCE PROGRAMS AND AS SUCH THERE'S PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PAY BACK THE LOAN. PLUS INTEREST. TO EITHER THE PROGRAMMING SO MANY BACK OR THE GENERAL FUND DOES NOT NEED ALONE ANYMORE. OKAY IN CHESTER THE TERMS OF THE INTERESTS ARE. THERE REGARDING THE- SMITH FINDING I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS WITH ME BY WE CAN GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF. OKAY THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I AND I AM A CHRISTIAN MAKE THIS ASSUMPTION. WE ARE COMPRISED BORROW SO MANY SPECIAL SIGNS IN ORDER TO HELP SELL THE CASH FLOW AND SO I DON'T KNOW STAY ALL. THE SAME TERMS APPLY TO ALL OF THEM TERMS OF THE BORROWING TERMS OR DATE. SOMEONEDIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT SPECIAL SIGNS BUT PERHAPS WE CAN GET BACK ON THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES TADA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUICK COMMENT JUST WANTED TO REALLY EXPRESS MY- YOU KNOW CONCERN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE SALT BROWN PROGRAM AND I THINK NOW IS THE TIME WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS AND INVEST MORE ON OUR PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE WE HAVE IT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW- WHAT. HOPEFULLY THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND FACING ANOTHER PANDEMIC BUT- WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO PUT OURSELVES IN A FURTHER DISADVANTAGE OF NOT HAVING. YOU HAVE POSITIONS AVAILABLE AND SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO. EXPRESS MY CONCERN FOR THE CUTS- THE ELIMINATION. OF THE EXPANSION AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN REALLY LOOK AT INVESTING EVEN MORE. SIR MELINDA'S THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN JUST A DOVE TAIL ON SENATOR HER TODDLER'S COMMENTS- CAN I ASK WHAT THE- ESTIMATE IS OF HOW MANY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WE WILL LOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS BECAUSE OF THE SONG BROWN CUTS. BUT. SURE. WELL IN TERMS OF RESIDENCIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE SONG GROUND PROGRAM THIS WOULD REPRESENT A REDUCTION- YOU KNOW FROM THE THIRTY THREE MILLION. SETTING IS DOWN TO ABOUT SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION IN BASE FUNDING SUPPORT IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ASK BECAUSE THE SONG BROWN COMMISSION. HAS THE ABILITY TO DELINEATE OR ARE SEPARATE THOSE FUNDS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES BUT WITH THE- THIRTY THREE MILLION. LAST YEAR ARE SPENT PROVIDED YOU KNOW NINETY SEVEN OUR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY AWARDS. TWENTY NURSE PRACTITIONER. FORTY FIVE. REGISTERED NURSE PROGRAM AWARDS SHOW US FROM YOU KNOW WITH THE TOTAL FUNDING OF APPROXIMATELY YOU KNOW GIVE OR TAKE FORTY FOUR MILLION I'LL WITHOUT- BEING REDUCED TO THIS HISTORIC BASELINE FUNDING THE PRODUCTION WOULD BE A ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL. BUT THE COMMISSION ULTIMATELY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD THESE DOLLARS TO SEPARATE THEM INTO CATEGORIES. BETWEEN EXISTING SLOTS EXPANSION SLOTS NEW PROGRAM- SLIDES AND TEACHING HEALTH CENTER SLOTS SO. IT'S INDETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME EXACTLY THE EXACT NUMBER OF THE REDUCTION OF SLOTS- BUT- YOU GET A SENSE FROM THE PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION. OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THAT IS CONCERNING TO SAY THE LEAST- BUT HI I'M WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH ONE ANOTHER I'M SURE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST THING WE NEED IS FEWER MEDICAL PROVIDERS NOT LAST SO BUT THANK YOU FOR THE- FOR THE ANSWER. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING SONG BROWN- SO I USED TO BE RESIDENCY DIRECTOR. AND SO I KNOW THAT- WITH MATCH DAYS ALREADY PASSED- SO THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE ACCEPTED. THE RESIDENTS FOR THE COMING YEAR- ALSO. RESIDENCIES ARE THREE YEARS LONG SO WHEN TO ADMIT SOMEONE THAT'S A THREE YEAR COMMITMENT. THE CUTS ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE THEY GOING TO AFFECT RESIDENT THAT PHYSICIANS AND THEN OF COURSE WE ALSO FIND AND HE'S I'M SURE THERE'S AN PEACE WHO'VE BEEN ACCEPTED AS WELL MAY HAVE BEEN EXCEPT AS WELL NOT SURE WHEN THEY MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. ARE GONNA FACTS. RESIDENTS WHO'VE ALREADY ESSENTIALLY MATCHED INTO THEIR TRAINING PROGRAMS AND NOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE RESIDENCY TRAINING. AND EDUCATION AS RESIDENTS THE OTHER THING JUST AS A COMMENT BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT-QUESTION. IS THAT. IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THAT SONG BROWN MAY PROVIDE FOR THOSE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE TEACHING HOSPITALS OR THE TEACHING. HEALTH CENTERS AS WELL- OFTEN DO FIND PORTIONS OF THAT TRAINING AS WELL AS A CLINICAL REVENUES BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT. HOSPITALS AND CLINICS HAVE. INDEED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAS ACTUALLY LOST A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CLINICAL REVENUE BECAUSE OF PREPARATION FOR COVERT AS WELL SO THEREFORE NOT IN. A GOOD FINANCIAL POSITION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE UP DIFFERENCES. THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS WELL SO I JUST WANNA PUT ALSO PUT THAT OUT THERE TO MAKE UP FOR. THE GAP THAT SOME GRAMMYS CREATES OKAY AND I CAN APPRECIATE OF US WHAT COMMENT ON THIS CUTS IN FUNDING. AND SONG BROWN IS IT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON RESIDENTS WHO'VE RAISED IN ADMITTED TO THEIR PROGRAMS WILL BE STARTING THEIR TRAINING. AND JULY FIRST- ORDER MAY BEEN STARTING EVEN EARLIER BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN MOVING PEOPLE EARLIER BUT BASICALLY PEOPLE EXPECTED STARTER TRAINING JULY FIRST. OF. TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE SOLAREDGE MONTHS NOW. THANK YOU SIR AND IF WE COULD WE WOULD HAVE TO TERREL BRAZIL FROM MARCH BID ADDRESS THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. I YES GOOD MORNING. SO I HAD THEM AWARDS THAT WE MAKE WITH THE SONG ROUND FINDS FIND THE UPCOMING CLASS SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE AWARDS THAT WE MADE WITH THE FINES FROM NINETEEN TWENTY YEARS ARE STARTING TO FIND THE UPCOMING CLASS SO WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM UNIQUE VANCE SO THOSE THOSE AWARDS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THEY'RE IN PLACE FOR THAT CLASSES THAT ARE STARTING THIS YEAR. OKAY AND MANY OF THE PROGRAMS ARE PRETTY FUN FOR A MULTI YEAR AWARD SO THAT THEY RECEIVED A FUNDING OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FOR SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS OKAY SO JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU'RE SAYING THE FUNDING CUTS THAT WERE BEING PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE YOU ALLOCATE THE MONEY HERE TO DANCE. CORRECT OR NOT AFFECTING. THE ENTERING CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY. REACHED NO FOR THOSE THAT WE HAVE FUN THOSE WIND PROGRAM ALWAYS A WARD. AND FOR THEIR FOR THE UPCOMING. AT THE NEXT COHORT OKAY ALL RIGHT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T UNDER KIND- THE RESIDENTS WHO VERY MADE A COMMITMENT TO GO TO THEIR PROGRAMS- LITERALLY HIT HIM MONTH AND A HALF. AND SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT- IDEA SURE TO CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON OUR WORK FORCE YOU KNOW WERE LATER GONNA BE TALKING TO DEPART CARE SERVICES. AND THE CASELOAD INCREASE IF I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATE TWO MILLION MORE PEOPLE MEDI CAL- THE SHORTAGES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AND- CERTAINLY SONG BROWN'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. AND SO- SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CAREFULLY LOOK I'VE CERTAINLY- UNDERSTAND THE SOMEONE WHO CAME INTO THE LEGISLATURE AND A TWENTY TEN WIN WITH A TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT- THE NEED TO. BE ABLE TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET AND HAVE. TO MAKE CUTS THAT WE MAY NOT NORMALLY LIKE TO. DO TO HAVE TO DO BUT AGAIN I HOPE THAT WE CAN BE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY- IN TERMS OF BEING SURE WE MAINTAIN OUR WORK FORCE- BOSA AND PRIMARY CARE AND CERTAINLY- I'D- APPRECIATE THAT WHAT THEY TALK ABOUT WITH MENTAL HEALTH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM OSHKOSH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES I CAN GOOD MORNING THANK YOU HI- SO I'M SHELLEY RELIED ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR- ON THE REVISED PROPOSALS- I THOUGHT I DO A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOCUSED INVESTIGATION AND THEN BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE LAUNDRY. ALONE FIND. SO THE DEPARTMENT'S TOTAL PROPOSED FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET IS NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE AUTHORIZED PHYSICIANS. AND THAT INCLUDES THE POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED IN THE- THE BUDGET. AS WELL AS THE REVISED. SO STARTING WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOCUSED INVESTIGATION SO THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF REGULATORY TOOLS TO ASSESS WHETHER ENROLLEES. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS TIMELY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE TOOLS INCLUDE ROUTINE MEDICAL SURVEYS WE DID FOCUS SURVEYS OF THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH. PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT ON THE KIA- ANNUAL REVIEW OF HEALTH PLAN PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE REVIEWING HEALTH PLAN TIMELY ACCESS ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS AND TRACKING AND TRENDING IN RALEIGH COMPLAINTS AN INDEPENDENT. MEDICAL REVIEW APPLICATION. BUT DESPITE THIS RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT OF ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY COMPLIANCE MANY UNRELEASED CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING TIMELY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND RELEASE OFTEN EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES FINDING IN NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT ARE ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS AND SCHEDULING TIMELY INITIAL AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS. EVEN WHEN IN A REALLY SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTS WITH THE PROVIDER HERE SHE MAY FACE ADDITIONAL OBSTACLES IN OBTAINING CARE. HEALTH PLAN OR HEALTH PLAN DELEGATE CLINICAL GUIDELINES IF THEY LIMIT OR DELAY INITIAL AUTHORIZATIONS TREATMENT DURATIONS ARE COVERED SERVICES. AS A RESULT MANY ENROLLEES ABANDONED THEIR EFFORTS TO SEEK IN NETWORK CARE AND THEY SUBSEQUENTLY PAY OUT OF POCKET FO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT AN OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER. OR THEY MAY SEEK CARE AT A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM OR AT WORST NOT GET HERE AT ALL. I AM REQUIRED TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ITS SISTER ALWAYS NAVIGATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND REMOVING THE UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS THOSE THAT I DESCRIBED. TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE ENROLLEE EXPERIENCE AND THE BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO CONDUCT FOCUSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND INVESTIGATIONS TWENTY FIVE FULL SERVICE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS ACROSS THE LARGE GROUP SMALL GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. SO THIS WOULD AVERAGE FIVE INVESTIGATIONS A YEAR OVER FIVE YEARS. CONDUCTING A FOCUSED SURVEYS ARE THE BUT INVESTIGATIONS AS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHY ENROLLEES AND PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN OBTAINING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND IDENTIFY ANY NON COMPLIANT PRACTICES OR BARRIERS IN THE HEALTH PLANS DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT MAY LEAD TO IN RALEIGH ARE. ANY NON COMPLIANT PLANTS WILL NEED TO PROVIDE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND OR MAYBE REFERRED TO OUR OFFICE OF ENFORCEMENT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL PENALTIES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTION. WITH THE GOAL OF BRINGING ANY PLANTS THAT ARE DEFICIENT IN COMPLIANCE. THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE SHARED WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TASK FORCE. AND WILL LEAD TO RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH PLAN PRACTICES AND ELIMINATE BARRIERS ARE. THE RESULTS OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS MAY ALSO IDENTIFY WHETHER ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE ACTION. IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS THAT ARE ALWAYS FACED WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS SPEAKING FROM HEALTH SERVICES AND TO MITIGATE. YOUR DELIVERY SYSTEM VIOLATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST FOURTEEN POINT FIVE POSITIONS AND TWO MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS- IN AND FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FROM THE MANAGED CARE FUND TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING THE TWENTY FIVE LOCUST SURVEYS. WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN FROM THE MANAGED CARE FUN- INCLUDING THE MAY REVISE IS A ONE TIME TRANSFER TO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MANAGED CARE FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND TO ASSIST WITH THE CASH SHORTAGE RESULTING FROM THE NINETEEN. THERE IS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT THE LOAN WILL BE REPAID WITH INTEREST IF THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS THE SITES. SO I WILL GO. TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I. HAD ASKED- THE FIRST ONE WAS AROUND JUST ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE METHODOLOGY IS REGARDING THE- H. SO THESE INVESTIGATIONS WILL INCLUDE A REVIEW OF EACH OF THE HEALTH PLANS PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING HEALTH. COVERAGE IN HER HEALTH SERVICES THE PROCEDURES FOR REGULATING UTILIZATION. REVIEW MECHANISMS INTERNAL PROCEDURES FOR ASSURING QUALITY HERE AND THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE PLAN AND PROVIDING HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND MEETING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF SUBSCRIBERS INTERNALLY. THE AREAS OF THE FOCUSED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS WILL INCLUDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ENROLLEES SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES. REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS FROM THE DATE AND TIME AND IT REALLY WAS DIAGNOSED THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION OR NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. THROUGH THE TIME THE ENROLLEE RECEIVED THE TREATMENT. WILL CONDUCT IN ROWLEY AND PROVIDER INTERVIEWS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT ARE ROWLEY'S EXPERIENCED IN OBTAINING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY CALLS DID YOU ONLY HAVE TO MAKE TO FIND A PROVIDER THE FREQUENCY OF IT REALLY CONTACTS WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO TRY TO FIND A PROVIDER OR GET AUTHORIZATION FOR SERVICES. AND THE FREQUENCY OF PROVIDER CONTACTS TO THE HEALTH PLAN PRIOR TO WHEN THE INITIATION OF TREATMENT. OTHER AREAS OF FOCUS INCLUDE THE TIMELINESS AND AMOUNTS OF PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENTS. REVIEW OF ENROLLEES SPECIFIC UTILIZATION. DATA AND IN DEPTH ASSESSMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICAL GUIDELINES AND HOW THEY WERE APPLIED IN SPECIFIC AND REALLY CASES. AND REVIEW OF OTHER RELEVANT UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES SPECIFIC TO HUMAN HEALTH SERVICES THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE TERMS FOR REPAYMENT OF THE MANAGED CARE FUND I DID MENTION THAT THERE IS PROFESSIONAL- THE PAYMENT- PROVISIONS IN THE IN THE MAY REVISE. THAT WOULD INCLUDE- INTEREST BUT THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS MONEY BUT FINANCE MAY BE ABLE TO SHARE SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. YOUR THIRD QUESTION RELATES TO HOW WE'RE THE DEPARTMENT IS MONITORING THE ADEQUACY OF HEALTH PLAN PROVIDER NETWORKS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT- THE PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE ADEQUATE AND THAT PLANS FULFIL THEIR RESPONSE. SO OF COURSE ENSURING ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS ITS NETWORK ASSESSMENTS BY CLAN AND BY NETWORK. THE KNOX KEEN ACT REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS REPORT WHEN A NETWORK EXPERIENCES A CHANGE IN 10% OF ITS PROVIDERS SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN KAISER CLOSE SOME OF ITS MEDICAL CENTERS. AND RE DIRECTED STAFF TO OTHER HIGH IMPACT AREAS DUE TO THE COLD IN NINETEEN OUTBREAK. KAISER FILED THAT INFORMATION WITH US. ADDITIONALLY HEALTH PLANS MUST ANNUALLY SUBMIT THE NETWORK OF CONTRACTED PROVIDERS FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE LINES OF BUSINESS. THAT INCLUDES ALL PROVIDE- PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS SPECIALIST PHYSICIANS AND NON PHYSICIAN MENTAL HEALTH. PROFESSIONALS THAT'LL HELP FACILITIES HOSPITALS CLINICS ETCETERA. DEPARTMENT ALL NETWORKS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS. THEY ALMOST PLANS MUST ALSO SUBMIT WHAT WE CALL A BLOCK TRANSFER FILING PRIOR TO A CONTRACT TERMINATION BETWEEN A HEALTH PLAN AND PROVIDER GROUP OR A HOSPITAL THAT IMPACTS- TWO THOUSAND OR MORE ENROLLEES. WE REVIEW THE PLANS% PROPOSED ALTERNATE PROVIDER GROUPS AND HOSPITALS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NETWORK CAN PROVIDE APPROPRIATE GEOGRAPHIC ACCESS AND THE CAPACITY TO SERVE THE ENROLLEES WHO WERE AFFECTED BY THE CONTRACT TERMINATIONS. AFTER THE DEPARTMENT APPROVES THE NETWORK FOR A PARTICULAR- PRODUCT TO THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE ADEQUACY OF THE NETWORK. IF IT FAILS TO MEET THE ADEQUACY STANDARDS THE DEPARTMENT HAS A NUMBER OF TOOLS AVAILABLE TO HELP HELP. HELP HELP PLAN COMPLIANCE INCLUDING. LAKES LEVYING ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES REQUIRING THE PLAN TO SEND AND RELEASED OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS TO ACCESS MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. OR ORDERING THE PLAN TO CEASE OFFERING HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS IN. YEAH HEALTH PLANS HAVE AN ONGOING DUTY TO ENSURE THEY HAVE ADEQUATE NETWORKS TO PROVIDE ENROLLEES WITH ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICE SERVICES IN A TIMELY AND GEOGRAPHICALLY APPROPRIATE MANNER PROVIDERS INCLUDING MEDICAL AND DENTAL CLINICS AND HOSPITALS HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES DUE TO HER THAT NINETEEN AS PATIENTS HAVE DELAYED RECEIVING ALL BUT EMERGENCY AND URGENT MEDICAL. SO LAST WEEK ON MAY TWENTIETH THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED AN ALL PLAN LETTER DIRECTING HEALTH PLANS FOR COMMERCIAL LINES OF BUSINESS JUST A MINUTE INFORMATIONAL FILING EXPLAINING THE STEPS THE PLAN HAS TAKEN. OR WILL TAKE TO ENSURE CONTINUED NETWORK ADEQUACY. WE WILL RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION ON JUNE FIFTH AND WE'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHAT STEPS THE PLANS ARE TAKING TO ENSURE THEY MAINTAIN ADEQUATE NETWORKS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS ALL PLANNED LETTER ALSO ENCOURAGE PLANTS TO TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND EXPEDITE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THIS INCLUDES EXPEDITING CLAIMS REVIEW AND PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING PAYMENTS WHEN FEASIBLE AND REDUCING THE TIME PROVIDERS HAVE TO WAIT ON PHONE. ON THE PHONE FOR AUTHORIZATIONS AND AMENDING COORDINATION OF CARE PROCEDURES. THE KNOX KEEN ACT REQUIRES UP PLANS TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS WITHIN FORTY FIVE WORKING DAYS OF THE PLANT'S RECEIPT OF A COMPLETE CLEAN CLAIM. IF THE CLAIM IS CLEAN IS IT IT PROVIDES ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO DETERMINE ITS LIABILITY FOR THE- IF THE CLAIM IS INCOMPLETE THE PLAN WORKS WITH THE PROVIDER TO GET MORE INFORMATION BEFORE AND THE CLAIM. GIVEN THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DIRECT PLANS TO PAY CLAIMS MORE QUICKLY OR TO PAY CLAIMS THAT ARE. SO WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- COMMENTS FROM LA. A GOOD MORNING SENATOR PAD I'M COREY HAS SHE DID WITH THE L. A. L. I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL- REQUEST ONGOING RESOURCES FOR THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH TWENTY FIVE INVESTIGATIONS- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PLANNING TO. INCORPORATE SOME OF THE NEW PROPOSED METHODOLOGIES INTO ITS EXISTING SURVEY REVIEW WORKLOAD- AND- WE WERE JUST NOT THAT YOU KNOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE MAY WANT TO. LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO DO SO GIVEN THAT- THE REQUEST IS FOR ONGOING RESOURCES. OKAY THANK YOU. FRENCH FINANCE. WHAT WE ARE ALMOST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE CONVERSATION ON THE LOANS SO GENERALLY ALL THE LOANS HAVE SIMILAR LANGUAGE WITH SOME LANGUAGE SPECIFYING A REPAYMENT SCHEDULE THE LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITH INTEREST ON IT BALANCE CALCULATED AT THE RATE ARE NOT THE POOL MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER AND THE RATE IS CURRENTLY ONE POINT SIX PERCENT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR GETTING INFORMATION QUICKLY SO QUICKLY. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE THAT DO YOU NEED C. IS ASKING THE PLANS- TO AT LEAST PROVIDE INFORMATIONAL FILINGS- REGARDS TO THEIR- INTERNS THERE SPOTS A CODED AND THE NETWORKS- BUT I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FUTURE OF OUR PROVIDER NETWORKS. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION DID A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS AND FOUND THAT 30% ARE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CLOSE. 30% HEARING FROM HOSPITALS- THE DATA THEY ARE HAVING. THE RECORD TREMENDOUS LOSSES IN THIS PERIOD- IRONICALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PREPARE FOR TOTAL BID AND- SO IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SEEING FEWER PATIENTS. IT'S IN MANY WAYS IT'S A- UNDERSCORES THE SUCCESS OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK CITY OR OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY- SAME TIME- YEAH IN ORDER TO GET THERE WE BOTH HAD TO SPEND MORE MONEY- TERMS OF SAAS YOU KNOW HOW. PRACTICES IN HOSPITALS HAVING TO GET MORE P. P. E. CHANGING THE PROCEDURES- ACTUALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VISITS THAT THEY'RE SAYING REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES ARE BEING DONE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A CAPACITY FOR BECAUSE OF IT. SO I THINK THAT CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT'S HEALTH CARE AS A PLAIN REGULATOR- HAS A ROLE IN HELPING IT AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO BE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORKS- YOU KNOW THE PLANS THEMSELVES HAVE CONTINUED CONTRACT FREEMAN'S- AND PEOPLE WELL DAVE THERE MAY BE SOME LOSSES BECAUSE- PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS AND FOR LOST HEALTH CARE COVERAGE- THERE I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE PLANS- DO YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING MAINTAIN NETWORKS ON A MORE PROSPECTIVE BASIS SO REALIZE IT AND THE RECKLESS BUT FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY OFTEN WHAT WE DO IS WE IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM AND THEN. ACT FOR A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR SOME CONSEQUENCE TO THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW SO. TO APPRECIATE THEIR YOU GOT THESE INFORMATIONAL FILINGS I APPRECIATE THAT MEANS THAT PLANTS HAVE TRIED TO COME UP WITH- THAT FIRSTS- LIKE LOANS TO PRACTICES AND SO FORTH BUT I PERSONALLY THINK THAT'S FINE NOT ENOUGH. SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE AN EIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT U. UNDERSCORE THAT THE CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO ENFORCE BEYOND- EARLIER IN FORTY FIVE DAYS- I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO TRY TO SPEED PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS- MORE QUICKLY- AND- I THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY RECONCILE THINGS ON THE BACK AND DO IT WE CAN CERTAINLY INDICATE THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW THE THERE'S A PROVIDER DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A RECORD OR HAS A RECORD OF A- FRAUD OR OTHER BEHAVIOR THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE FOR THOSE PARTICULAR. ENTITIES THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT RAPID PAYMENT BUT- MOST PROVIDERS DON'T FALL IN THAT CATEGORY AND- THEY'RE SUFFERING-CASH FLOW ISSUES OF THAT A SIGNIFICANT MAGNITUDE IF LAID OFF STAFF- THIS DOESN'T HELP A BIT UNDER YOU KNOW THAT THIS UNDERMINES OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING SO- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE FARM IS HEALTH CARE ARE DOING BEYOND WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF. FOR EXAMPLE TRYING TO SPEAK TO HIM AND SO OF COURSE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE SAYING THAT YOU'RE LEGALLY YOU CAN'T DO MORE SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD SUGGEST TO US AS THE LEGISLATURE WE CAN CERTAINLY GIVE YOU MORE LEGAL POWERS TO BE ABLE TO SPEED UP PAYMENTS MORE RAPIDLY TO PHYSICIANS PERHAPS AND HOSPITAL SO AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SO FOR EXAMPLE IS THERE A WAY WE CAN MOVE IT UP TO THIRTY DAYS INSTEAD OF FORTY FIVE DAYS. SECONDED. DEPARTMENT PLEASE COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU DOC PAN WELL SIR. I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE- THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS FACING IT'S- DEFINITELY SERIOUS AND WIDESPREAD AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. WE ARE LIMITED BY WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS US TO DO- AND THAT'S WHY IN THE- A PLAN LETTER THAT WE JUST RELEASED WE ARE. ENCOURAGING PLANTS TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING- TERMS OF PAYING. CLAIMS MORE QUICKLY AND- YOU KNOW TAKING CARE OF THE BACKLOG OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DID WAS TO- DIRECT THE PLANS TO. BE SURE TO PAY TELEHEALTH VISITS AT THE SAME RATE AS AN IN PERSON VISIT. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE CLINICS IN PARTICULAR WERE WERE REALLY HURTING AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THERE IS- THERE- PATIENT. VISITS DROP SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW THE BENEFIT OF A CAPITATED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS BEEN CONTINUED TO BE PAID. TO THOSE PROVIDERS WHO ARE- UNDER CAPITATION- WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO I'M I'M REALLY NOT IN A POSITION TO SUGGEST THAT- YOU HAVE YOUR OWN IDEAS ABOUT THAT BUT- AS I SAID WE ARE. LIMITED BY WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS US TO DO AND WITHIN THAT WE DO TRY TO. ENCOURAGE AND PUSH AND SUGGESTED THE PLANS THAT THEY NEED TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS AND MANY OF THEM ARE STEPPING UP AND WE'LL FIND OUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE DOING THAT. ONCE WE RECEIVE THESE FILINGS- IN EARLY JUNE. OKAY SO- I KNOW YOU MENTIONED TELEHEALTH AND APPRECIATE THE ACTIONS TAKEN AROUND TELEHEALTH- WHAT ABOUT TELEPHONIC CARE WHICH SOME PEOPLE WOULD INCLUDE WITHIN TELEHEALTH BUT SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT- SO CARE PROVIDED. BY OVER THE TELEPHONE MANY. PATIENTS DON'T MEAN TELL HOW IS GREAT SPEAK SUPPORT TELEHEALTH BUT YOU NEED SOMETHING A BOTH AND SOMETIMES THE ONLY THING AT THE OTHER END OF PATIENTS A TELEPHONE- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT MY A LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANT CERTAINLY. IS WILL THAT BILLS ME FOR ANY TIME I TALK TO THEM ON THE PHONE SO WHY SHOULDN'T- HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS BE PAID. WHEN THEY PROVIDE. TELEPHONIC ADVICE. TO RESPOND TO THAT. HELLO MHC STILL ON THE LINE. SEE YOU'RE STILL ON MY SWEETER HI CAN YOU HEAR ME I CAN HEAR YOU YES OKAY I'M SORRY- I DID I DID RESPOND TO THAT ALL RIGHT YOU CAN HEAR YOU AT THE TIME OKAY THAT'S OKAY- SO TELEPHONIC VISITS- WERE INCLUDED IN OUR DIRECTION TO THE PLANTS TO PAY THOSE AT THE SAME RATE AS AN IN PERSON VISIT TO BECAUSE AS AS YOU SAY YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO A VIDEO VISIT SO TELEPHONIC VISITS ARE ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME REQUIREMENTS FOR PAYMENT. OKAY PROJECT THAT- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE- PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH RELEASED A PROPOSAL- I THINK ON WEDNESDAY- TWO. I THINK- SUGGESTS THAT PLANS COULD ESSENTIALLY DO ACER PROTESTS THE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM DOT HELP AGAIN STABILIZE THE FINANCES IMPROVED CASH FLOW FOR A PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES- IS THAT. RIGHT SO. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL AND- IT FLEW PAST WE USE THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO IMPLEMENT THAT BUT SORTIES WOULD YOU NEED. THOSE DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A PROPOSAL THANK YOU- I HAVE SEEN THE PROPOSAL AND- IT'S VERY INTERESTING I. WOULD BE HAPPY TO- WE WILL BE REVEALING IT AS IF IT IF IT MOVES FORWARD- AND BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED. OKAY WELL PRECIADO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THAT AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THAT REGARD. OKAY OKAY. AND THEN- I KNOW THAT THE HOSPITALS HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS AS WELL. AND I DON'T WANNA FORGET OUR SUBSPECIALTY COLLEAGUES BUT IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW THEY'VE THEY'VE RAISED SOME CONCERNS IN TERMS OF- AGAIN TO THAT. POST THAT PAYMENT TIMING WHICH I KNOW WE TOUCHED ON AS WELL AS- ALSO- TRYING TO. NOW THERE'S A TRYING TRYING TO STABILIZE OUR FINANCES WELL SO THIS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE- INFORMATIONAL FILINGS YOU SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE BACK ON. JUNE FIFTH I REALIZE WE HAVE A BUDGET TO PASS BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WILL YOU BE REPORTING BACK TO LEGISLATURE. AND I'VE BEEN A WHAT TIME LINE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE FINDING FROM THESE INFORMATIONAL FILINGS. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY ON THE TIME FRAME TIME FRAME WE OBVIOUSLY WILL IT DO THE ANALYSIS AND PUT TOGETHER SOME INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ONCE YOU RECEIVE THE FILINGS- SO THAT WILL BE. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE PLANS THAT THIS IS NOT A CONFIDENTIAL FILING THAT THEY'RE SUBMITTING TO US SO. WE WILL GET THAT INFORMATION OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- SO REALLY WANTED DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PLANS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND APPRECIATE THEM- SHARING THIS INFORMATION ONLY WITH YOU BUT- WITH- THE PUBLIC. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS FIND ON THE BACK AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORKS- BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS ANYMORE. I MEAN WE DO HAVE RADIO AREAS OF SHORTAGES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SO FORTH BUT- MORE BROADLY- WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTING PRO ACTIVELY- NOT TRYING TO ACT RETROACTIVELY. IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING AN ISSUE THAT WE ALREADY KNOW IT'S COMING DOWN THE LINE. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- TAKE ACTION NOW. AND YEAH. BE SURE THAT- OUR PRESS THESE ARE PRACTICES ARE AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR PATIENCE- WHEN PATIENTS NEED THEM. UNDERSTOOD OKAY THANK YOU SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IN TERMS OF- HERE SO I ACTUALLY TOOK MORE LONG TERM- YEAH WE'VE TALKED WE SPENT SOME TIME IN OUR HEARINGS TALKING ABOUT- SOME THE CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD WITH- YOU KNOW DOING YOUR SURVEYS AND SO FORTH REGARDING AN AT WORK ADEQUACY L. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOCUSED INVESTIGATIONS- AND DOING INTERVIEWS AND SO FORTH HOW DO YOU SEE COVE IT IMPACTING THOSE. THOSE EFFORTS- YEAH WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES GETTING ACCURATE DATA REGARDS TO- NETWORK ADEQUACY SURVEYS BEFORE I REALIZED THAT IN OUR MORE RECENT PRESENTATIONS MANY OF THOSE ISSUES WERE BEING ADDRESSED OVER TIME- BUT ALSO IN ORDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT THE LEGISLATURES PASSED. THOUGH THAT DATA WAS CRITICAL TO THAT SO DO YOU SEE. WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S COVERED- AND IMPINGING ON OUR- THE ABILITY OF THE PART AND TO BASICALLY ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT- WE'RE ASKING DEPARTMENT TO FORCE. AND GETTING THE DATA TO DO THAT. WELL CERTAINLY IT PRESENTS A CHALLENGE AND THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING- ON SITE VISITS AT THE PLANTS IN EITHER OUR SURVEYS OR OUR FINANCIAL EXAMS AT LEAST AND IN THE SHORT TERM. SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ALL BEING DONE- FOR CALLING DESKSIDE IT'S BASICALLY IN THE PLANTS ARE SUBMITTING THE INFORMATION TO US ELECTRONICALLY. WE ARE WE EXPECT THAT WE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO- CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IN THAT REGARD- BUT IT CERTAINLY IS A CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS- THE- THE BUDGET ASSUMES THAT DATE THIS WILL BE FUNDED ARE STARTING TO IN JANUARY- SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO SEE HOW. THINGS GO- AND IF WE HAVE TO DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS REMOTELY WE WILL- AND WE'LL JUST. HAVE TO TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP. THE STAFF AND EVERYBODY IS SAFE OKAY. WELL I THINK I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO TALK TO AND REVIEW WHAT THE PLANS ARE DOING IN THEIR PROCESSES BUT ALSO TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE- ENROLLEES AND PROVIDERS AS WELL AS WHICH I KNOW YOU MENTIONED SO I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT- IT'S YOU WANT TO LOOK AT PROCEDURES BUT- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF PROCEDURES UNTIL YOU TALK TO THE PEOPLE ARE SUBJECTED TO THOSE PROCEDURES. SO ALL RIGHT ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SPEAKING OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR RELIED FOR YOUR PRESENTATION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- I'M TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE- KEEP OUR PROVIDER NETWORKS GOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND WE HAVE FOR. FOURTEEN QUESTIONS AS WELL AS- MANY ITEMS TO DISCUSS- SO- WE JUST GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH ALL THE ALL THE- HIGHLIGHTS IN THE QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE COMMENT FROM LA- AND FINANCED AND WILL TAKE MEMBER QUESTIONS SO. PART OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GOOD MORNING THIS IS JC COOPER CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR I THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME THIS THIS MORNING SENATOR PAN. I'M SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW ITEMS I WILL TRY TO GET THROUGH THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE I HIT ALL OF THE- ITEMS AND THEN WE'LL GO FORWARD WITH QUESTIONS. ON THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION% DOLLAR TOTAL FUN FOR THE SUPPORT OF DH YES PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS IS AN INCREASE OF EIGHT POINT 5% OVER THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT NEARLY DOWN TWO POINT NINE BILLION. DOLLARS OR TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT. A RELATIVE TO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THIS CHANGE IS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING. UPDATED ESTIMATED CASELOAD UTILIZATION TIMING OF PAYMENTS. AND THE IMPACT OF KOBE IN NINETEEN. THESE REDUCTIONS RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS THE NET IMPACT OF SEVERAL KEY FACTORS OF WHICH ALL WALK THROUGH. I'M THE FIRST ONE BEING ABOUT A ONE POINT- SORRY THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND COSTS DUE TO PROJECTED INCREASE IN THE MEDIC HOW CASELOAD. TO KOBE NINETEEN ABOUT CURRENT YEAR END BUDGET YEAR. I'M NOT DCS PROJECTS AN AVERAGE MONTHLY MEDICAL ENROLLMENT TO BE THIRTEEN MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN CURRENT YEAR VIRTUALLY FLAT COMPARED TO WHAT IT IS IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. HOWEVER DO YOU SEE AS PROJECTS AN AVERAGE MONTHLY MEDIC HOW CASELOAD FOR BUDGET YEAR TO BE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN POINT TWO MILLION OR NINE POINT 2% INCREASE OVER THE RISE CURRENT YOUR FORECAST. EACH CASELOAD REFLECT THE NUMBER OF THINGS- IT REFLECTS A HISTORICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MEDIC HELP SHE SLOWED IN THE CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. IT IS SEEMS A ONE MONTH LAG BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND SHE SLOWED AND PACKED. IT ALSO USES- I KIESLER DISTRIBUTION ACROSS OUR VARIOUS- PROGRAM SERVICES. ARE BASED ON WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RECOVERY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. AND WOULD JUST POINT THAT PIECE OUT IS IT WILL BE A BIG- DISCUSSION ORDERS THE ELLY ELLS. REVIEW OF OUR CASELOAD AS WELL. YEAH THING THAT YOU'LL SEE WITHIN OUR CHANCELLOR PROJECTIONS AS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH H. R. SIX TWO OH ONE AND THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO SUSPEND. OR I JUST ENROLL ANY MEMBERS FROM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THIS IS JIM'S APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE LOST THEIR ELIGIBILITY DURING A GIVEN MONTH THAT WILL CONTINUE ON DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF RENEWALS. THANK YOU BRIAN WITH H. R. SIX TO R. ONE. LEO HAS A PROJECTED IRAQIS ARE PROJECTIONS AS OF YESTERDAY AFTERNOON NEELY- HAS RECOMMENDED REDUCING THE GENERAL FUND. AND BY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- FOR BOTH CURRENT YEAR END BUDGET. THAT BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT HAS REDUCED THEIR ESTIMATE- DELEO IN DH CS IS OVERALL CASELOAD PROJECTIONS ARE SIMILAR. THE DEPARTMENT OF KOBE NINETEEN CASELOADS INCREASE INCLUDED A GREATER NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS POPULATION. RESULTING IN A HIGHER GENERAL FUND COSTS. ARE THE L. E. O. N. DH CS I'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE ASSUMPTIONS. OF CASELOAD. AND DCS HAS PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY I REGARDING THOSE PROJECTIONS AS RECENTLY AS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS JUST TO BE CLEAR- AND THOSE INCLUDE- REVISIONS IN REGARDS TO IN THE DH CS ESTIMATE BE ATTRIBUTED PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES KOBE NINETEEN IMPACT. SHOULD HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS. AS WELL AS NOTATING THAT THE CASELOAD INCREASE FOR THIS CATEGORY CATEGORY IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SUSPENSION OF RENEWALS. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT USES DRIVING CASELOAD- WITHIN OUR PROJECTIONS- SO WELL THE ACS IS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS CASELOAD- IT MAY BE ON THE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE SIDE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE L. A. AS ESTIMATE LIKELY UNDERESTIMATES THIS POPULATION- HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT- IS REVIEWING THE CURRENT CHANGES IN NEARLY AS RECOMMENDATION. AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ELLIE REGARDING. IT BUT PERFECT. I'LL THERE ARE IN ORDER TO ATTRIBUTES THIS IN CASE AND COST ON THERE ARE NUMBER OF SAVINGS PROPOSALS WITHIN THE MEDICARE BUDGET- INCLUDING A THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE OF. FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE ENHANCED EMERGENCY F. MAP- I MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH H. R. SIX TO R. ONE. I THINK YOU KNOW I WILL NOW KIND OF WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL SAVING PROPOSALS- I WOULD JUST NOTE GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE DEFICIT- THE INCREASE CASELOAD WITH THEN. ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THE NEED TO PUT FORWARD A BALANCED BUDGET YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS. WE WERE CONSTRAINED BY NUMBER OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS- WHILE ALSO TRYING TO MAXIMIZE WHERE POSSIBLE FEDERAL FUNDS I'M SO VERY CHALLENGING- RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD PUT FORWARD. ON THEY INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR ELIMINATING ITEMS WITHIN BOTH THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AND JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OPTIONAL BENEFITS OF RE PURPOSING PROP. FIFTY SIX IN A VARIETY OF OTHER REDUCTION I WALK. THE DEPARTMENT DOES PUT FORWARD A DECREASE OF TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND FOR THE FOLLOWING BUDGET SOLUTION. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND FROM REVERTING FUNDS FROM PREVIOUS AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. ON THESE INCLUDE THE REVERSION OF THE ENROLLMENT NAVIGATORS AND MEDIC COW INTERPRETERS PILOT PROJECT. ELIMINATION OF THE REMAINING FUNDS FOR THE CAREGIVER RESOURCES CENTER AUGMENTATION. ELIMINATION OF FUNDING FOR THE CAL HOP PROGRAM. AS WELL AS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THERE IS ALSO A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SAVINGS RELATED TO PROPOSALS IN THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- WHICH INCLUDES NOTABLY THE- CAL AIM OR THE CALIFORNIA DANCING IN INVADING MEDIC HELP FOR A PROPOSAL. HERE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGING A WITH CMS EXTENSIVELY IN REGARDS TO A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF OUR CURRENT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING VERY WELL- OUR PROPOSAL AND CMS DISK HAVE BEEN AN AS IS EXTENSION FOR ONE YEAR ARE PROPOSING WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT CORRESPONDING YEAR THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD WITH CMS AND DETAILS TO BE DONE AND DISCUSSED. BUT DID WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE REGARDING OUR EXTENSION WE DO SEE THE CONVERSATIONS VERY PROMISING AS THEY HAD RECOMMENDED WITH THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN B. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH LABOR THAT IS CURRENTLY UP. FOR RENEWAL- THAT THEY RECOMMENDED WE EXTEND THAT THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALIGNED WITH OUR PROPOSED ELEVEN FIFTEEN ONE YEAR EXTENSION. WELL THIS WILL BE CRITICAL IN ORDER TO YOU GIVE PROVIDERS I'M IN MANAGED CARE PLANS TIME- I HAD TO GET THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND TO BE PREPARED FOR THE- THE CALLIN PROPOSAL ON DOWN THE LINE AS WELL AS- THE EXTENSION OF ELEVEN FIFTEEN. IT ITEM AND DEAL. OF THE BASIC HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM- ON THE POSTPARTUM MENTAL HEALTH EXPANSION. AGE BLIND AND DISABLED FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL INCREASED AS WELL AS THE MEDICARE PART D. DISREGARD. THE UNDOCUMENTED OLDER ADULTS ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION THE THREE FORTY B. SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TOOL. AND THEN THE WITHDRAWING OF THE- HEARING AID GRANT PROGRAM FOR NON MEDICAL CHILDREN UP TO 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PUT FORWARD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND- RELATED TO ELIMINATING VARIOUS ADULT OPTIONAL MEDICARE BENEFITS. I'M I WON'T READ THEM THEY ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN OUR- SUMMARY ON ONE NOTABLE ITEM WOULD BE ON THE REVERSION OF ADULT DENTAL SERVICES FROM CURRENT FULL RESTORATION. A REVERTING TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN RESTORATION LEVELS- WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES PROGRAM BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED OPTIONAL BENEFITS. I WOULD NOTE THAT ANY OPTIONAL BENEFITS REDUCTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO CHILDREN OR EPS U. G. BENEFITS BENEFICIARIES IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. SEE RELATED SERVICES EMERGENCY AND HOSPITAL BASED SERVICES AS WELL AS THEY WILL MAINTAIN. TO BE AVAILABLE WITHIN FQHCS. THE NEXT PORTION OF PROPOSED SAVINGS IS I'M A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND TO REDIRECT- PROPERTY SIX REVENUES TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTS WITH THE MEDICAL CASE WOULD GROW. I'LL BE THE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE ELIMINATING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS- DENTAL OFFICES A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. YES FAMILY PLANNING AND WOMEN'S HEALTH AS WELL AS THE BASS AND I. C. F. T. D. IMMENSE. IT ALSO PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM. AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM. IT ALSO PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THE PHYSICIAN AND DENIS LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR COHORT TWO THROUGH FIVE I WOULD NOTE. THAT WE ARE STILL COMMITTED TO THE- APPROPRIATION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO COHORT ONE AND CONTINUE THOSE PAYMENTS OR CO HOST ONE THROUGH THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD AS COMMITTED TO. THERE IS A REDUCTION FOR TRAUMA SCREENING AND TRAUMA PROVIDER TRAINING AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN PROPERTIES SIX RELATED TO HOME HEALTH. PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE CENTERS FREESTANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE AND THE HIV AND AIDS WAIVER ADJUSTMENTS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO PUT FORWARD RATE REDUCTIONS IN PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES EQUAL TO THREE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION GENERAL FUND- FOR A VARIETY OF. PROGRAMS I WON'T MENTION ALL OF THEM BUT WILL NOTABLY MANSION INCLUDES A REDUCED- MANAGED CARE CAPITATION RATE OF ONE POINT 5% FOR THE BRIDGE PERIOD- WHICH INCLUDES JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. YOUR DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY IT ALSO INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING A RISK CORRIDOR- BUT FOR THE SAME TIME PERIOD- WITHIN THE MANAGED CARE PLAN I WOULD NOTICE THE RISK CORRIDOR IS NOT SCORED WITHIN THE BUDGET- AS IT WOULD I'M NOT WE WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE CASH OR CASH BUDGET INTEL BUDGETYOUR PLUS YOU. IT ALSO PROPOSES THE ELIMINATION OF PPS CARVED OUT FOR ACCURACY'S I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER FAN OF FUND TRANSFERS AND RECOVERIES. I'M NOT EQUAL TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION GENERAL FUND WITHIN THE BUDGET MOST NOTABLY THE REAR- IMPOSING THE MEDI CAL ESTATE RECOVERY PROGRAM. OTHER BUDGET ITEMS ON THEIR OTHER CANDIDATES YOU OTHER KEY FACTORS WITHIN THE MEDIC HOW BUDGETS- TO MAKE NOTE OF A DECREASE OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION GENERAL FUNDS FROM THE RECENTLY APPROVED MCO TAX. ON THAT OFFSETS THE GENERAL FUND WITHIN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TIME PERIOD AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION GENERAL FUND SHORT TERM FEDERAL FUNDS AND THAT IS ESTIMATED. FOR INAPPROPRIATELY CLAIMING VARIOUS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR STATE ON THE PROGRAM. I GO INTO DETAIL ON THAT IN A LITTLE BIT ON THE QUESTION. THE FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATED PROGRAM EXPENDITURES ARE TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN CURRENT YEAR AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR. I'M OVERALL FAMILY HEALTH- ESTIMATE SHE'S LOADS ARE PROJECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE OR EXPERIENCED MINOR GROWTH- NOTABLE ITEMS WITHIN- SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITHIN THE FAMILY HEALTH OR OUR QUEUE ITEMS ONLY TO NOTE. ON CURRENT YEAR INCLUDE SAVINGS BASED ON ACTUAL RETROACTIVE COLLECTIONS OF NON BLOOD- NONE OF BLOOD DOCTOR REBATE READ- BUT DOCTOR DRUG REBATES SORRY ABOUT THAT- DOES YOUR SCORED THROUGH APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY AND INCLUDED IN CURRENT YEAR HOWEVER WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE NO WE BIG COLLECTIONS CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN BUDGET. HERE FOR EVERY WOMAN COUNTS- CURRENT YOUR ALTHOUGH DOWN FROM THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE. ON IS UP SLIGHTLY HIGHER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION I'M IN THIS DISTRIBUTED TO INCLUDING AN MRI IS AN MRI GUIDED BIOPSIES WITHIN EVERY WOMAN COUNTS PROGRAM. WHICH IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT. NEXT I WILL GO OVER VERY KOBE EXPENSE EXPENSES THAT WERE PUT IN THE BUDGET IN REGARDS TO OUR RESPONSE TO COPE WITH HERE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. I'M QUOTED AND- NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE FEDERAL AND STATE DECLARATIONS OF EMERGENCY DID TRIGGER A LARGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE MEDICAID FLEXIBILITY IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT SPEAKS FOR. ADDITIONALLY THE PRESIDENT SIGNED A MAJOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND CREATES NEW OPTIONS FOR US TO ADDRESS THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITHIN OUR PROGRAM. THE FIRST NOTABLE ONE AS MENTIONED BEFORE WAS THE EMERGENCY F. MAP IMPACT I'M I WOULD JUST MAKE SURE IT'S NOTATED THAT H. R. SIXTY ONE DOES INCREASE THE AFTERMATH ON A REGULAR MEDICAID 50% AND EXPENDITURES BY SIX. PERCENT BUT THEN SHIPPED BY FOUR POINT OF TWENTY TWENTY- IT WILL LAST IN THE LAST DAY OF THE CALENDAR QUARTER IN WHICH THE NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND- EMERGENCY F. MAP IS ASSUMED IN THE BUDGET TO. REMOVE JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR DH CS DH YES OTHER ADMIN AND FOR OTHER SISTER DEPARTMENTS AS APPROPRIATE AND IN ALIGNMENT WITH CMS'S GUIDANCE IN REGARDS TO WHAT THAT F. NOT APPLIED YOUR- THE DEPARTMENT ALSO DID. RESULT ASK FOR A REDUCTION OF THE UTILIZATION WITHIN THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PROGRAM BOTH ON THE MEDICAL AND DENTAL SIDE. IN RESPONSE YOU COULD BE NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT HELP. I NEEDED THREE ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE WAIVER REQUEST YOU C. M. S. ONE EMERGENCY ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER REQUEST AND ONE DISASTER STATE PLAN AMENDMENT RULING OVER FIVE DOZEN FLEXIBILITIES ARE FOR THE STATE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ARE THESE FLEXIBILITIES SPANNED OVER A NUMBER OF AREAS. INCLUDING PROVIDER PARTICIPATION BUILDING IN CONDITION FOR PAYMENT- INCLUDE FLEXIBILITIES FOR AUTHORIZATION AND UTILIZATION CONTROLS STATE FAIR HEARINGS BENEFIT FLEXIBILITIES TELEHEALTH AND TELEPHONIC EXPANSION CAME IT RAINS AND VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY- SOME OF THE WAIVER FLEXIBILITIES ADOPTED ROLE WILL ROLL BACK IMMEDIATELY UPON THE CLOSURE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH. PERIOD HOWEVER SOME MOST NOTABLE ARE THE TELEHEALTH THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW WE SHOULD ADJUST ITS POLICY ON TELEHEALTH IS SHOWN TO BE- TO HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE IN EXPANDING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE. WITH SUCH A RAPID ADOPTION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES WE WANT TO LEARN FROM IT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT WORKS WE WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK- AND WHEN IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WHILE MAINTAINING QUALITY OF CARE IN INCREASING ACCESS- SO WE WILL BE SPENDING TIME TO ANALYZE THIS NEW DOCTOR EVEN HAD CONVERSATIONS RECENTLY WITH BOTH COVERED CALIFORNIA AND CALPERS. BUT WE CAN ALL LEARN TOGETHER IN REGARDS TO THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH. SERVICES FOR THE FUTURE. IT IS A BIT ESPECIALLY IN EVENINGS IN AND WE CAN. I'M AS WELL AS THE WEEK DAY IT COULD BE REDUCED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO EXPLORE THIS. I WOULD NOTE THAT MEDICARE HOW TELL HELP PAYMENT PARITY FOR THE TELE HEALTH PORTION- PRIOR TO KOBE WOULD KOBE DID IS BRING THE PARITY FOR THE TELEPHONIC HE'S A BIT. AND THEN WE WOULD NEED TO EXPLORE THAT POLICY AFTER THE EMERGENCY THE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE AND SERVICES. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WHILE WE HAD PARITY WITHIN P. FOR SERVICE WE NEED TO EXPLORE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN MANAGED CARE. AS WELL AS WITH R. S. WHICH THE PARTNERS IN ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- AN ETIQUETTE ADEQUATE NETWORK ADEQUACY AFTER THIS SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES. THE PANDEMIC AND AFTER I WOULD THERE ARE NUMBER. KOBE RELATED EXPENSES SCORED IN THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET- I WILL JUST QUICKLY LIST THEM SO ODD PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THOSE. AND THEN I WILL GO INTO RESPONDING TO CERTAIN QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THROUGH THROUGH THIS OVER TO YOU. I'M SO I DON'T SCORED IN THE BUDGET INCLUDED ON A NEW ELIGIBILITY GROUP FOR UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS THIS COVERS TESTING TESTING RELATED SERVICES AND CODE NINETEEN TREATMENT. I WOULD NOTICE THE KOBE NINETEEN TREATMENT PORTION IS WITHIN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER WHICH WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR APPROVAL FROM THE- FROM CMS. WE HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR A DISASTER SPOTS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF THE ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE WAIVER REQUEST ALL OF WHICH ARE POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. WE SHARE BROADLY THROUGH A WEEKLY STAKEHOLDER UPDATE AT THE DEPARTMENT SENT OUT WITH BOTH GUIDANCE AND CMS APPROVAL TO MAKE SURE STAKEHOLDERS PROVIDERS. AND OTHERS ARE AWARE. OF WHAT HAS AND HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED. OTHER ITEMS AND THE X. OF HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR SIXTY FIVE- AND OVER. IT INCLUDES ALLOWING FOR Q. HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. AND IT COVERS ADULT OVER THE COUNTER COUGH AND COLD MEDICINE. ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE FOR BOTH I HSS AND WAIVER PERSONAL CARE SERVICES FOR SICK LEAVE BENEFITS ALLOWED. ON THROUGH VARIOUS. FEDERAL BILLS. AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL LAB REIMBURSEMENT RATES AT MEDICARE RATES I JUST. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENTS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE INCREASING CASH FLOW TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. UPPER BEHAVIOR HELP HIM IS BOTH ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE. A 10% RATE INCREASE FOR LONG TERM CARE- INCLUDING VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS WITHIN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN I'M CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN APPROVED. OUR SUPPORT WITHIN THE BUDGET AS WELL. THERE IS OUR HIGHLAND WALKS OF BOTH- MEDIC HOW LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND FAMILY HELPED US CEMENT- AS WELL AS KOBE NINETEEN ESTIMATED IMPACTS- I ANSWERED A HANDFUL OF THE QUESTIONS THROUGH THAT ABUSE BUT THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD ON. THAT YOU PROPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT TO WALK THROUGH. BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WHICH I HAVEN'T ADDRESSED YET IS HOW THE DEPARTMENT- PLANS TO FOCUS ON THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND WHAT THEY WILL UNDERTAKE TO PRESERVE NETWORKS AN ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS DURING THIS TIME. ONE THING I WOULD JUST NOTE IS THAT YOURS DOES HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY TO MONITOR OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS NETWORKS. DAILY REPORTING BY THE PLANS PLANS ALREADY WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO US EVERY DAY. ON ANY PHYSICIAN OFFICES OR FACILITY CLOSURES EVEN IF THEY ARE TEMPORARY CLOSURES OR CONSOLIDATION CLOSERS. SIMILARLY TO WHAT YOU HEARD. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE SERVICES. IN A MARCH APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS REPORTED THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES AND- CONSOLIDATION OF SOME CLINICS IN PROVIDER OFFICES. WHICH RESULTED IN DECREASED UTILIZATION OF SERVICES DUE TO THE POSTPONEMENT ELECTIVE PROCEDURES EMERGING SERVICES. DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY WORK WITH THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO ALTERNATIVE CARE WHETHER THAT IS TELEHEALTH SERVICES. WERE REDIRECTED TO OTHER PRIMARY CARE LOCATIONS- DURING THIS TIME PERIOD ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE. TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. LANCER COURTS- MEMBERS IMPACTS- BY THESE CLOSURES- ON ON A DAILY BASIS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S ALREADY MENTIONED THAT PARTICULAR PIECE. ONE THIRTY YEARS YES WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE PLANS TO REPORT ON NETWORK AVAILABILITY BEYOND ABOVE THEIR CURRENT CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT PLANS ARE MEETING. PERFORMANCE LEVELS THIS WILL GO ON I'M INCLUDING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRACKING NOT JUST THE- DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE- PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BUT ALSO ANY OF THE BUDGET- IMPACTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT FORWARD. THEY WILL HAVE AN INCREASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH NETWORK ADEQUACY MEMBER GRIEVANCES I'M AS WELL AS OUTRAGED MEMBERS TO PROVIDE FOCUS ON ACCESS TO CARE. I WOULD NOTATE THAT- A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR PROVIDERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING. PROVIDING ADVANCED EVENTS FOR PROVIDERS ACCELERATING PAY FOR PERFORMANCE IN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. TO PROVIDERS ADVANCING CAPITATION OR CLAIMS PAYMENT. ON IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WAVING PUBLIC HOSPITAL RATE RANGE FEES AND EXPEDITING INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFER PAYMENTS. ON ENHANCING RATES OR EXPANDING INCENTIVES FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PROVIDING VARIOUS GRANTS PROVIDERS. AS WELL AS FUNDING PROVIDERS FOR THE PURCHASE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. ON DCS IS ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH C. A MASTER REQUEST AND- PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF KERR'S ACT FUNDING TO MEDICARE PROVIDERS. WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DISTRIBUTED YEAH. ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DISCUSS- IS B. ELIMINATION OF BERRIES HOLLY COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS MOST NOTABLY- M. S. S. P. AND C. BASS I'M GIVEN THE CHALLENGING TIMES WITH THE COLD OUTBREAKS THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS THAT THESE PROPOSALS WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT FORWARD. WITH THE ELIMINATION OF BOTH SEA BASS AND M. S. S. P. A G. H. C. S. WOULD COMPLETE A FULL TRANSITION PLAN FOR BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR TRANSITION OF THOSE BENEFICIARIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- THIS WOULD INCLUDE. EXISTING MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WELL AS OTHER ACA H. CBS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE WITHIN OUR PROGRAM. I'M MOST NOTABLY I WOULD MENTION THAT INDIVIDUALS WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE. YOU HAVE ACCESS YOU- ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT AND CARE COORDINATION- AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH ASSESSMENTS TO ENSURE INDIVIDUALS ARE ASSESSED AND NEEDS. ARE BEING MET. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NURSE ADVICE LINES AS WELL AS FULL SERVICES INCLUDING DIETITIAN PHYSICIAN SOCIAL WORKER NURSING PHARMACY ETCETERA WITHIN THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN BENEFITS. THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THOSE SERVICES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE HELP. ALLOW THEM TO SAFELY RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITY- WE ALSO THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM- IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ARE I. JUST A SERVICE THEN. AND WE WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE AS NECESSARY OTHER HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICE WAIVER PROGRAMS INCLUDING. BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS PROGRAM. ON V. H. C. B. A. OR THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER THE PEACE PROGRAMS- AND IN CERTAIN AREAS THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS PILOT PROGRAM THAT DOES EXIST. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND- HOWEVER I WANTED A LONG TO KIND OF WALK THROUGH ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING ON- IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY- SORRY FRIDAY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF. AGING AS WELL AS AGENCY I'M DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SURGE CAPACITY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. I'M DECOMPRESSING BOTH HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC. INTRUDERS CONVERSATIONS FOR THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF OR SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN BRAINSTORMING ON HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS THIS CURRENT ISSUE. IN SO- THAT WE HAVE PUT FORWARD ON IT WILL BE EXPLORING A NEW BENEFIT WITHIN MEDICARE OUT- IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE CALLING TO LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFITS. ON AND IT WOULD BE. ABLE TO PROVIDE I'M ELIGIBLE CONSUMERS WITH A COORDINATED AND BUNDLED SET OF SERVICES TO HELP- OLDER ADULT INDIVIDUAL STAY HOME AND BE HEALTHY. IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN BOTH THE FIRST SERVICE AND IN MANAGED CARE- THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS TO BE FIGURED OUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL- AND WE JUST KNOW THAT WE PLAN ON ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THIS PROCESS- BUT WHEN I WALK THROUGH JUST. A FEW OF THE DETAILS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AS WE ARE. AND DISSECTING IT AT THIS TIME. THE TARGET PARKING. WERE INCLUDE SHORT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STAYS SO SOMEONE TRANSITIONING FROM HOSPITAL TO HOME. AND IN THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS WOULD INVOLVE ADDITIONAL THERAPY IN CLINICAL SERVICES. AND ALSO WOULD INCLUDE LOW ACUITY SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STAYS LONG TERM. STAYS ON AS WELL AS PREVENTING SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STAYS. ON I WOULD NOTE THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR HOME CARE WITH RAP SERVICES BOTH MEDICAL AND COMMUNITY BASED BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE TRANSITIONS. BUT THAT THAT LIVING FACILITIES SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. FOR THE ELDERLY ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES OR BOARDING CHAIR IT IS A SPECIFIC BENEFIT FOR HOME BASED MAKES SENSE. HELLO TERM CARE HOME BENEFIT WOULD INCLUDE- INDIVIDUAL PERSON CENTRED ASSESSMENTS TRANSITION CARE MANAGEMENT AND OF COURSE THE BUNDLED MEDICAL AND HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. AND TO HELP THEM RESIDE SAFELY WITHIN THEIR HOME. AS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS I'M HAVING OPTIONS THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO- RESIDE IN THEIR HOME I WILL BE CRITICAL AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH. ON THIS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE MEDICAL SERVICES WOULD INCLUDE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO YOU AND IT'S THE WAY WE ARE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUNDLING THIS VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN WITHIN OUR BEER YES HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED WAIVERS OR EVEN THE WAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT WITH A LOT OF SERVICES. ON IN OUR PREVIOUS CALLIN PROPOSAL THIS STEP BACK TO LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WHERE WE WOULD PROPOSE A HOSPICE LIKE BENEFIT MINUS AND THE WIFE OF COURSE ON THAT ALLOWS A BUNDLED PAYMENTS- TO AN AGENCY TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE RICH THE CORRESPONDING. SERVICES I'M NOT. THE DIRECTOR JUST A THAT PREVIOUS CRY THIS BAND. CAN YOU JUST TELL US WE- DO YOU. I MEAN IS THIS YOU'RE- GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR OR- JUST TIME TIMELINE WISE. YEAH SO- BE WILLING OUR PROPOSAL IS TO DO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OR THROUGH THE END OF JULY EXTENSIVELY DEFEATED UP INPUTS THE METER. IT THEN WITH CMS THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY GET RESPECTIVE APPROVALS WITH THE GOAL OF APPROVAL FROM CMS. WHERE TO GO LIVE IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DO KNOW THAT AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE WE DO WANT THE AGENCY TO BE A LICENSED ENTITY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN REGARDS TO THOSE TIME LINES. BUT THAT IS CURRENTLY. WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING FROM A TIME LINE. IT IS THAT INCORPORATED INTO THE MAY BUDGET PROPOSAL OR- WE ARE NOT CLOSING THAT THIS WOULD BE COST NEUTRAL GIVEN THE SAVINGS- THAT WE WOULD HAVE. FROM REMOVING OR TRANSITIONING INDIVIDUALS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ARE PREVENTING. A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STATE SO IT WOULD BE A BUDGET NEUTRAL OUR PROPOSAL OKAY WELL I'D- GIVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON P. C. S. I JUST WANT YOU KNOW. I THINK IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COMING UP AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION I HOPE THAT- BETWEEN NOW AND LET'S SEE I GUESS THAT WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY EXPLORE SOME OF THESE THINGS AND I'M SURE THAT. STAKEHOLDERS ONE AWAY AND IT'S- NOT ONLY WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT WITH US ABOUT AS WELL SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR- DESCRIPTION BUT I PROBABLY GONNA ASK THAT. TRY TO KEEP IT ABBRVIATED AND THEN TRY TO COVER THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. YES ON THE LINE TO THE NEXT QUESTIONS. I'M IN YES AND HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS- TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT WE DID WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GAVE A FULL DESCRIPTION OF IT TODAY AS WE HAD JUST ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY. AND SO IN REGARDS TO YOUR NEXT QUESTION FOR THE RISK ORDER PROPOSED- WITHIN THE BUDGET. IT WOULD BE FOR THE BRIDGE. IT WOULD INCLUDE A TWO SIDED AND SYMMETRICAL WHICH MEANS. THAT BOTH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE EQUALLY PROTECTED AGAINST BOTH EXCEPT THE- PLAN GAINS AND LOSSES. IT IT WOULD BE CHEERED ON AND HAVE A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS- IT WOULD BOTH APPLY TO THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WELL JUST WANNA MAKE. SURE THAT THAT IT IS NOTED AS WELL. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE- CS WOULD BE. WOULD BEGIN COLLECTING DATA FOR THE RISK CORRIDOR NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE. IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR ADEQUATE TIME FOR THE PLAN TO BE ABLE TO REPORT SUCH INFORMATION. I'M CLAIMS REPORT OUT SO IT HAS A LONGER TIME PERIOD ON IT. MOVING ONTO YOUR NEXT QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE RATIONALE FOR PROCEEDING WITH THE MEDIC HOW ARE EX PHARMACY KERR OUTS. IN MAINTAINING. IN WITHDRAWING THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND HE MEANT FOR THE NON HOSPITAL THREE FORTY B. AND B. OVERALL PROPOSAL ON FROM INSPECTION RESULTS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR ALSO SEATED WITH POLICY CHANGES RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL ON THE GENERATE SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS. WITHIN THE BUDGET YOU'RE IN OUT YEARS ESTIMATE ON ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUNDS BABY. I'M NO JEANETTE REVENUE LOSSES FOR THE I'M NOT HOSPITAL THREE FORTY CLINICS HOWEVER GIVEN THE CODE NIGHT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN OVERALL ECONOMIC SITUATION. ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAD TO MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS IN REGARDS TO MEETING THE BUDGET SHORTFALLS. AND THEREFORE I'M DCS REMAINS REALLY COMMITTED TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS- WITH IMPACTED PARTIES AND THE ROLLOUT TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. TO MEDICARE RACKS- COME JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE NEXT I ON HAS TO DO WITH THE NEW BECAUSE A REFORM I WOULD JUST NOTE WE HAVE RELEASED OUR TRAILER BELOW ON THIS- STAKEHOLDER CONSENSUS IS- IS. SOMEWHAT MIXED THOUGH WE ARE STILL TALKING THROUGH A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH APPS ON THE FRAMEWORK ON AN OVERALL APPROACH- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN REGARDS TO YOU IDENTIFYING QUALITY METRICS AND BENCHMARKS. ON THE ONE PIECE I WOULD JUST NOTE- FOR SOME STAKEHOLDERS- I THINK THAT IT IS- A LOT TO TRANSITION FROM THE PREVIOUS KIND OF COST ALL PAYMENTS TO QUALITY ADD ON'S. ESPECIALLY SINCE WE DON'T KNOW WHICH METRICS- AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPLAIN THE FRAMEWORK AND THE FACT THAT MOVING TO QUALITY OVER COST- WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BE VERY PATIENT FOCUSED THIS THIS. IS THE GOAL OF THE DEPARTMENT AT THIS TIME. YOUR NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE PROCEEDING- WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE- AND DURING THIS THIS CALL THAT TIME PERIOD. THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE CHALLENGE. YOUR OVERALL KIND OF DELIVERY SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR WITH DENTAL SERVICES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- AND JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE NOTE THAT- HOWEVER WE STILL- PROPOSED. TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM DENTAL MANAGED CARE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD ESPECIALLY. AS WE HAVE SEEN AND- OVER TIME AND RECOGNIZE THAT- THE SERVICES PROVIDED. I'M IN THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE AREA I'M LAG BEHIND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A TRANSITION PLAN FOR COMMENTS OF STAKEHOLDERS. EARLIER THIS MONTH- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING PEOPLE'S COMMENTS ON THAT. I'M MOST NOTABLY I WOULD NOTE THAT ON THROUGH THAT EVALUATION AND TRANSITION PLAN. HE SAYS THERE IS A PRETTY EXTENSIVE OVERLAP WITH EACH OF THE FIRST SERVICE DENTAL PROVIDERS AND THE MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS- BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED- THAT THROUGH THIS TRANSITION ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE- A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH BOTH PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES- WE WOULD DO BENEFICIARY NOTIFICATIONS FAQS PROVIDER TRAININGS. IN ENROLLMENT WHERE- THERE'S AN OVERLAP FOR EXAMPLE IN SACRAMENTO THERE'S 99% OVERLAP WITH OUR FUTURE. GENERAL PROVIDERS IN 85% IN LOS ANGELES THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THOSE PROVIDERS IN COMMUNICATING. VERY CLEARLY. TO BENEFICIARIES DURING THIS TRANSITION. ON THE NEW ITEM THAT I WILL AND IS QUESTIONS REGARDS TO THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO FEDERAL CLAIMING. ON CALIFORNIA PROVIDE STATE ONLY FULL SCOPE- SERVICES TO CERTAIN IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WHO MEET ALL MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR IMMIGRATE IMMIGRATION STATUS. I'M UNDER THE STATE ONLY A MEDICARE PROGRAMS FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR EMERGENCY AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES. AND NON EMERGENCY AND NON PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES ARE COVERED WITH THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS. ON THE DEPARTMENT ID AT THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED A SYSTEM ERROR- FOR CERTAIN DELIVERY SYSTEMS I WHERE WE WERE DRYING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR NON EMERGENCY AND NON PREGNANCY RELATED. SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO RETURN THESE FEDERAL FUNDS TO CMS- THAT WERE CLAIMED I'M WITHIN A YEAR OF IDENTIFYING THOSE PIECES. FURTHERMORE THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO SEEK FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR A GENERAL FUND FEDERAL FUND PERCENT PROXY. FOR MANAGED CARE CAPITATION PAYMENTS TO INSURERS ON ALL NECESSARY FISCAL INTEGRITY. MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. I DO UNDERSTAND- THAT THIS IS A LARGE ADJUSTMENT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN DEFICIT BEFORE THAT- AND THE DEPARTMENT- HAS TAKEN MULTIPLE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE RISK IN THE FUTURE. I'M I WOULD JUST POINT OUT A FEW OF THEM- AS WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON OUR SYSTEMS AND OUR OUR- OVERSIGHT OF OUR FISCAL ON AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE DEPARTMENT DID CREATE THIS YEAR I KNEW- CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER POSITION REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE REORGANIZED TO ALLOW THE BEHAVIOR OUT FINANCING FUNCTIONS. COME UNDER THE I'M A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE FINANCES ALL OF THESE ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. TO OUR FINANCES WE HAVE A VERY KEEN EYE ON THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT I'M HOWEVER GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE ERRORS AND SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATELY THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM MEANS THAT SMALL ERRORS DO YOU HAVE A PRETTY LARGE- PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCE. THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON UPDATING SYSTEMS MAKING SURE THAT SYSTEMS ARE- ALLOWING FOR US TO BE SIX- IN OUR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT I'M MOVING FORWARD AND STAY COMMITTED TO IDENTIFYING AND FIXING ERRORS. THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. BUT NOW I WILL HAND IT OFF TO- DOCTOR GILBERT ON THE DIRECTORS WHO WILL ANSWER THE LAST QUESTION IN REGARDS TO I. T. I'M IN ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. FROM HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU J. C. DR PAM MEMBERS OF THE THING YOU AND GOOD MORNING SO I'M GONNA ANSWER NUMBER THIRTEEN AND THEN HAVE SOME JUST GENERAL COMMENTS ON SHORT AND BRIEF ABOUT WHAT IS PRESENTED. SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS PROBABLY WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THE DESPERATE- IT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THE T. H. YES AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT AND N. C. M. S. ARE VERY FOCUSED ON REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS USED AROUND. THE MEDICAL RECORDS MEDICAL PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA BUT JUST TO REMIND WE HAVE RELEASED THREE BIG AREAS OF PROGRAMS OF THE MEDICAID MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS MMI US IN ROMANS AND ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS IN OUR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR. ECONOMIC CLINICAL THEY'RE HIGH TECH AND REALLY THE GOAL HAS BEEN TO MERGE THOSE TOGETHER INTO THIS MEDICAL ENTERPRISE SYSTEM OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS AN OVERALL SYSTEM OF SUCH SYSTEMS WITH COMPONENTS AND MODULES AS PART OF THAT BUT THE IDEA BEING. THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS AN OVERALL. IT'S A PROGRAM CHEAPER. YOU LOOK AT A MUCH WORSE USE OF RESOURCE JOINT IS TO FUNCTION ONE. AND YOUR- DON'T LOOK AT IT AS A SERIES OF MODULES AND PROGRAMMES UNDER AN UMBRELLA. AS YOU WELL KNOW DHS AND MEDICAL INCREDIBLY COMPLEX WE HAVE SOME VERY OLD SYSTEMS- SOME AS OLD AS FORTY YEARS AGO WHICH SORT OF BOGGLES THE MIND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO CONCERTS. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS REST AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CALIFORNIA PHARMA TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS REALLY CONSOLIDATED OUR IT MODERNIZATION FFORTS WHETHER THAT'S MEANT TO MODERNIZATION M. I. S. MODERNIZATION HEY RALPH. DATA MODERNIZATION ETCETERA REALLY LOOK AT IT FROM AN ENTERPRISE APPROACH BOTH FROM A PLANNING AND DELIVERY POINT OF VIEW- THIS. ARE IS GOING TO BE ON THE- LINE A SMALLER. OF THE FEDERAL DRAWN REPORTING EFFORT THAT IS- A PROGRAM THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT- WE DO A LOT OF PAPERWORK WAS HERE LAST THIS WILL ALLOW FOR IT NOT ONLY TO BE. WE NEVER REALLY MODERNIZE BUT IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW THE BETTER REPORTING MUCH MORE ABILITY TO PROGRAM AND ADAPT AND ADOPT. ENGINES THAT ARE NECESSARY WELL THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE OUR FOCUS- THERE WILL BE SOME POTENTIAL DELAY OF OTHER PROJECTS. THAT FDR AS THE CALL IS GOING TO BE REALLY THE FOCUS FOR HER I. T. IN TERMS OF THE AMBIENCE. AND MODERNIZATION. THIS YEAR. IN TERMS OF GNERAL COMMENTS OF COURSE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS- DOCTOR PIANO WANNA. I JUST JUST EMPHASIZE- ONE AREA OF THE J. C. TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN TERMS OF REALLY MAKING SURE THAT. WE'RE MONITORING OUR NETWORK AND SO IN TERMS OF WHAT JC TALKED ABOUT THE DAILY REPORTING. IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION WITH PLANS ABOUT ANY CHANGES THAT THEY TELL US ABOUT IN TERMS OF SAYING OUR MEMBERS ARE TO BE CARED FOR WHERE ARE THEY GONNA BE CARED FOR. HOW ARE THEY GONNA BE CARED FOR IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR MONITORING. BUT I ALSO WANT TO YOU KNOW. REALLY EMPHASIZED THAT THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS OF STEPPED UP. THEIR PAYING CLAIMS VERY RAPIDLY WHEN WE DID A SURVEY. THOSE THEY RANGE FROM FIVE DAY CLEAN CLAIMS OF COURSE AS A SUBDIRECTORY ARE MENTIONED. FIVE DAYS FIFTEEN DAYS TWENTY DAYS AMERICAN ALLIES ON A TIGHTER- TIME FRAME AND THEN THE GENERAL TIME FRAME UNDER KNOCKS KEEN. THAT'S BEEN A BIG PIECE OF MINISTRATION MENTIONED THERE'S JUST BEEN A MULTITUDE. OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT PLANS. OF USED YOUR RANGING FROM CHANGING TO FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CALKINS. ADVANCING CAPITATION I'M LOOKING AT HISTORICAL PAYMENT LEVELS AND MAKING UP THE DIFFERENCE BOTH FOR SPECIALISTS AND HOSPITALS AS YOU MENTION. AND OF COURSE MANY PCPS ARE CAPITATED SO THERE CONTINUED TO BE PAID. SOME ALL PROS ARE COMPLICATED BY SOME PLANS THAT THERE IS A LOT BY PLANS. NUMBER OF COURSE THEN THEY WOULD BE RECEIVING- COMBAT INCOME AS WELL THEY'RE JUST. REALLY UP. THE THING I WOULD SAY TO THE COMMITTEE. WE ARE REALLY LARGE AND FUND. AND THE CHOICES THAT HAD TO BE MADE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REDUCE OUR OBLIGATION FOR GENERAL FUND GIVEN THE INCREASE IN CASELOAD AND GIVEN THE NEED TO BALANCE THE BUDGET I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. AND THE CHOICES THAT HAD TO BE MADE- WHETHER THEY ARE ROUND THE ISSUES OF OPTIONAL BENEFITS. OR A PROP FIFTY SIX. ARE REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT AS A PHYSICIAN AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS- WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE. REALLY UNDERSTANDS. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TURNED TO SEE WHAT WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE- BUT REALLY- WANTED TO JUST MAKE THAT POINT SO LET IT GO AT THAT AND BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANKS MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER- WITH THIS DEPARTMENT WE NORMALLY- I THINK TAKE TWO FULL HEARING DAYS TO HEAR DCS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE'RE NOW TRYING TO DO IT AND- ANNA OUR CONTRACT. OR SO. LMAO COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES OKAY BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- FIRST I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR CASELOAD ESTIMATES- MISS COOPER DID A GREAT JOB OF JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZING THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BUT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE- THE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE QUESTION THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS SO AS AS MISS COOPER SAID WE ARE NOT FAR OFF AND WE REALLY DO THINK THAT THEIR OVERALL CASELOAD PROJECTIONS ARE IN TERMS OF NEW ENROLLEES ARE REASONABLE. BUT WHAT WE QUESTION IS- THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT THE STATE WOULD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE. AS A RESULT OF THESE DO ENROLL THE- AND IT'S HERE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT A VERY SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE NEW ENROLLEES- WOULD BE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THESE DAYS INDIVIDUALS HAVE VERY HIGH COSTS OFTEN MORE THAN TEN TIMES. THE COST OF OTHER ENROLLEES IN THE PROGRAM UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S. PROJECTIONS SENIORS IN PERSON WITH THIS. WOULD GROW AT A ROUGHLY COMPARABLE RATE AS ANOTHER POT LARGE POPULATIONS THAT ARE THE THAT IS THE CHILDLESS ADULT POPULATION THAT HAS A LEGIBILITY THROUGH THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION. WE QUESTION THIS ASSUMPTION AS WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDLESS ADULTS HAVE R. WELL PARTICIPATE TOO MUCH GREATER EXTENT IN THE LABOR MARKET AND THEREFORE THERE ARE THAT ECONOMIC VIEW THAT THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE FAMILIES ARE FACING IN THEIR INCOMES ARE GOING TO VERY MUCH MORE. WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ECONOMY THAN US SENIORS WHO MAY BE RETIRED AND- INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO WHO MIGHT ONLY. MAY NOT WORK FULL TIME. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IN THAT. SOME OF THE SOON TO INDIVIDUALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING INTO THE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES- CASELOAD SHOULD REALLY BE SHIFTED TO A DIFFERENT KEESLER CATEGORY. SECOND WE FIND IS THAT- THE STATE- THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF NEW ENROLLMENT WILL BE FROM- FROM INDIVIDUALS WHERE THE STATE PAYS A HIGH SHERIFF COST STATE PAYS A HIGH SHARE OF COSTS FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITY BUT THE STATE PAYS QUITE A LOW SHARE OF COST FOR THESE DOES CHILDLESS ADULTS ARE SPEAKING IN PREVIOUSLY AS WELL AS CHILDREN FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. CURRENTLY THE CASELOAD IN MEDIC HOW- COMPRISE ABOUT 40% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE LOWER STATE SHARE OF COST. BUT UNDER THE UNDER THE GUN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS FOR NEW CASELOAD 80% OF NEW ENROLLEES WOULD- HAVE THE HIGHER STATE SHARE OF COST AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY IT WOULD BE NECESSARILY SO DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT MEDICARE OKAY SO. MOREOVER WE HAVE LOOKED AT. SOME OF THE DATA ON- ON HOW MANY LOW INCOME PEOPLE OR ADULTS TEND TO HAVE CHILDREN WHICH IMPACTS WHETHER OR NOT THEY BE PUT IN THE OPTIONAL EXPANSION CATEGORY OR IN THE FAMILY'S CATEGORY. AND WE FIND THAT A MAJORITY ARE DO NOT HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE HOME AND THEREFORE WOULD LIKELY BE PUT INTO THE- CHILDLESS ADULT CATEGORY. SO THESE THESE- DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS HAVE A MAJOR GENERAL FUND MPACT AND THEY INFORM WHY WE RECOMMEND ADJUSTING MEDI CAL BUDGET DOWNWARD BY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ACROSS BOTH TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE'VE TRIED ISSUE AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS ONLY ADJUSTING REALLY WHERE SOME OF THE NEW CASELOAD- NEW INNOVATIVE NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE PROGRAM WOULD BE PLACED AMONG THE VARIOUS. CATEGORIES SO WE TRY TO DO OUR WE DO OUR BEST TO ASSUME ESSENTIALLY THE SAME COST PER CASE AS A AS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD AT LEAST WITHIN THE CASELOAD CATEGORIES. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED ADJUSTMENT THE END THIS STILL INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND ROLLING IN THE PROGRAM AND ITS STILL ASSUMES A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE NEW ENTRANCE WOULD BE FAMILIES- AND CHILDREN AS OPPOSED TO THE LESS EXPENSIVE CHILDLESS ADULTS. AS SUCH WE DO BELIEVE THAT I RECOMMENDED IT ADJUSTMENT IS CONSERVATIVE AND CAN WITHSTAND SOME OF THIS- PHYSICAL RISK THE STATE WOULD FACE SAY IS- NEW ENROLLMENT WE'RE ACTUALLY EVEN HIGHER THAN WHAT THE. ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING. NOW I'D TURN SOME COMMENTS THAT WE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE LATE INTO THE OPTIONAL EXPAND OUT EXCUSE ME THE OPTIONAL BENEFIT ELIMINATIONS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE REDUCTIONS IN ELIGIBILITY. THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDED AN ENHANCED FEDERAL SHARE OF COST FOR THE PROGRAM UP TO A CERTAIN CONDITIONS ON STAGE BUT THEY MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY LEVELS. IN READING SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE FIND IT UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL RULE THAT BANNED THOSE FEDERAL CONDITIONS ON THE ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING COULD ACTUALLY YOU SORT OF AFFECTIVELY PROHIBITED THE STATE FROM MAKING BENEFIT. AND ELIGIBILITY REDUCTIONS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING NOW THE ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING BRINGS IN MUCH MORE FEDERAL FUNDING THAN THE REDUCTIONS TO THE OPTIONAL BENEFITS SUCH AS THE SEA BASS PROGRAM ADULT DENTAL SERVICES AND I AND I AND OTHERS WOULD THAT. WOULD RELIEVE THE GENERAL FUND. AND SO WE DO HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ULTIMATELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL RULES- WOULD PROHIBIT US AFFECTIVELY FROM GETTING RID OF THOSE- GETTING RID OF THOSE ELIMINATIONS OR REDUCTIONS. AND THEN- AND THEN HOW THE STATE WILL ORT OF RE BALANCE THE OVERALL BUDGET IF IN FACT THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE NOT. FUNCTIONALLY ALLOWABLE. NEXTEL TURN QUICKLY TO THE- THE I. T. SYSTEM CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN IT IN MEDIC HAL- WE WE'VE- ANALYZE THIS- PRELIMINARILY AND FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ONLY RECEIVED SO FAR PRELIMINARY COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE IN INFORMATION FOR THE NEW MODERNIZATION EFFORTS. AND SO WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TIMELY MANNER ON TOTAL COST AND SCHEDULE AND SCOPE OF THE MODERNIZATION EFFORT. NEXT TURN QUICKLY TO SOME OF THE COVERT RELATED- POLICY CHANGES SUCH AS AN EXPANSION OF COVERAGE- ELIGIBILITY FOR THE UNINSURED FOUR COVE IN TESTING AND TREATMENT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER- NEW FLEXIBILITIES HELLO AT THE END MINISTRATION IS PURSUING- RELATED TO TREATMENT INCLUDING SUCH THINGS AS TELEHEALTH OR- A LONG TERM CARE TEMPORARY RATE INCREASE- THE- THE LET THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TRAINABLE LANGUAGE- THAT WOULD. AUTHORIZE SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO PURSUE SUCH POLICIES AS THEY COME FORWARD AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT SUCH FLEXIBILITIES MAYBE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CASE OF SAY A SECOND WAVE OF HOPE IN NINETEEN OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE- THAT THAT A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT LEGEND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. OF ANY NEW POLICIES AND SPENDING THAT IS ADOPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION SO AT MINIMUM THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER- SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ANY CHANGE POLICY CHANGES AND FUNDING CHANGING CHANGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. CHOOSES TO ADOPT- AND THEN LASTLY WE DO HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- STATE ONLY CLAIMING ISSUE THIS IS THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION THAT THE STATE IS NEEDING TO REPAY TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUR QUESTIONS ARE LARGELY ABOUT. WHAT PORTION OF THAT IS ONGOING VERSES OUT ONE TIME AND REALLY RECEIVING A SCHEDULE ABOUT SORT OF WHICH DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT OCCURRED AND OVER WHAT TIME PERIOD THAT OCCURRED. BACK INCLUDES MY REMARKS. AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU THE OF. AND I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN ALSO HELP ANSWER THE QUESTION POSED BY THE ELIO PARTY REMARKS. LAURA YEAH NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- RESPOND TO FIRST AND THE REQUEST REQUEST ABOUT INFORMATION FOR IT PROJECTS AND THE NEW- MODERNIZATION PROJECT OFFERS AT DH CS AND THEN SECONDLY ABOUT CASELOAD- THE COVER RELATED CASELOADS SO. FIRST WE ARE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING- TO AMEND EXISTING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THE NEW- ENTERPRISE MODERNIZATION EFFORT AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS BUDGET LANGUAGE CURRENTLY- IS IN REFERENCE TO HUMANS BUT WILL IT WERE PROPOSING TO UPDATE IT TO REFLECT THE NEW- ENTERPRISE MODERNIZATION EFFORT. AND IT REQUIRES- THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY PROJECT STATUS I THINK THE GREEN CONTRACT INFORMATION ON PROJECT. ON. PURPOSE AND COSTS SO. WE THINK THAT THAT DRESSING QUESTIONS ON THE PACKAGE AND GREET NEW EFFORT. AND REGARDING THE CASELOAD AND MACHINES THAT- ELLIE- BROUGHT IN A RECURRING CLICKBAIT WE USED THE REMEMBER PER MONTH COST AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THAT WE DEVELOPED OUR ESTIMATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING ON UPDATING THE SYSTEM AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND AND- DOWN FROM THE CURRENT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE DOLLAR DIFFERENCE. AND MAINLY WE WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WE USED DATA BASED ON THE LAST RECESSION AND THE IMPACTS ON THE POPULATION THAT WE REFLECT THAT WE THINK WOULD BE A ROLE IN. THAT IN MEDIC COW. IS JOHN AVAILABLE AND ALL. ON THE ACA. OPTIONAL EXPANSION POPULATION THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE ON THAT SINCE IT'S DIFFICULT AT TWO ON MAKING ASSUMPTIONS IT'S- DIFFICULT TO. ESTIMATE D. THE TOTAL CASELOAD. IN EACH OF THESE POPULATIONS HOWEVER AS ELIA NOTED BECAUSE HESE ARE CHILDLESS. SINGLE ADULTS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY UNEMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER I WILL NO BECAUSE THEIR TALENTS OF GOLD IF THEY DO RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THEY WOULD BE ABOUT INCOME THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS FOR MEDI CAL. AND IF THE CHILD A SINGLE GOAL IS EARNING MINIMUM WAGE AND NOT WORKING FULL TIME THEY'RE ALSO LIKELY TO ALREADY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR- CASELOAD ESTIMATE IS REASONABLE AND ANY- AND ANY CHANGES ANY FURTHER CHANGES TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE WOULD JUST. BE A PURELY RANDOM YES. OKAY THANK YOU. CORRECT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ST LOUIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M JUST WONDERING IF- WE CAN GET COMMENT ON THE RATIONALE FOR CUTTING. FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE SENIOR PROGRAMS WHEN WE HAVE KEPT FINDING- WE'VE LEFT UNTOUCHED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET RELATING TO THE MARKET TO LESS VULNERABLE POPULATION BE NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD I THINK UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH- CONSIDERING. THE FORMER POPULATION IS AT MUCH MORE RISK- I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. OKAY SO J. C. COOPER HERE I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT- AS WE MENTIONED ALL OF THE- PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD WERE VERY CHALLENGING AND I HAD TO PUT FORWARD AND ESPECIALLY AROUND OUR SENIOR POPULATIONS I THINK ONE OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS TO- HAVE CLEAR ACCESS AND ELIGIBILITY TO MEDICAL SERVICES AND NOT- REMOVING THAT THE ELIGIBILITY. AND TO THE QUESTION REGARDS THE YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS AND THEN. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BOTH THE BASS AN MSSP ARE CONSIDERED OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND I'MGIVEN THE- RESTRICTIONS AND ABILITIES AND DELIVERS THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE TO US I'M TO MEET THE- YOU KNOW THE SCOPE AND SIZE OF THE DEFICIT AS WELL AS HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. WE HAD TO PUT FORWARD A RECOMMEND SUMS I'M VERY DIFFICULT PRODUCTIONS INCLUDING BOTH THE BASS AND THAT'S THAT'S THE- I THINK I WOULD ALSO MENTION AS I. HIGHLIGHTED IN MY EARLIER REMARKS THAT. A LARGE NUMBER IF NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. AND YOU KNOW COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND WRAP SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ENSURE. THAT THEY ARE PREVENTING BOTH SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS WELL AS HOSPITALIZATION. THANK YOU AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THERE AGAIN THOUGH I STILL HAVE KIDS I HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE CUT FUNDING TO THE VERY POPULATION. THAT HAS BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC AND IF. PERHAPS THERE IS A SECOND WAVE- I JUST I'M NOT. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT BUT NONE THE LESS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT TO BE LIKE TO ADD ON TO THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT- IF NOT I DO HAVE ONE. ADDITIONAL QUESTION UNLESS SHE CARES TO RESPOND- TO MY CONCERNS SURE I THINK THAT'S- THE OTHER REASON WE ARE- ANNOUNCING THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME NEW BENEFITS WHICH WILL WILL GREATLY. ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT RISK ESPECIALLY OUR SENIOR POPULATION AT RISK IN THEIR HOME- WHICH AT THIS TIME IS A BETTER PLACE FOR US TO BE PROVIDING CARE- AS A LARGE NUMBER OF I'M SENIOR INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GOING TO BE GOING IN. UNTIL VERY YES- PROGRAM CENTERS AND SO THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE COMING MONTHS. TO FINE TUNE THAT BENEFIT- AND M. PROPOSAL AND TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT OUR SENIORS. OKAY WELL AND I KNOW YOU NOTED THAT THE DETAILS OF THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM- HAVE YET TO BE WORKED OUT SO I DON'T HAVE- AS MUCH CONFIDENCE AS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REGARDING THAT PROGRAM. BUT I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THERE A CONCERN- ON THE pPROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BRING FORWARD A LAWSUIT BECAUSE OF THE SWEEPING OF THE- PROP SIX FIFTY SIX FUNDING. SO YOU KNOW THE ELIMINATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. AS WELL AS THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM- WORD SHE WERE DIFFICULT RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE DO FEEL THAT THE REDIRECTION TO COVER THE ALLOWABLE OR THE INCREASE CASELOAD- WITHIN THE PROGRAM- IS IT WITH AN ALIGNMENT OF THOSE STATUTES IN THE- IN THE LOT AND SO THE- BOWLING GAUGE WITH PEOPLE AS B. AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THIS. THE BUDGET DISCUSSION. THANK YOU SIR TACO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT MANY OF THE PROS PROPOSED CUTS THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN WITH. YOU KNOW I I'D REALLY LIKE TO START WITH AT THE HEALTH FOR ALL SENIORS. AS YOU MAY KNOW I COME FROM CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE. AT THE AGRICULTURE BASED ECONOMY. WE HAVE FARM WORKERS THAT. DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE BUT THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE THEY'RE THE SOLE PROVIDERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE STILL RELYING ON- TO YOU KNOW FOR HOUSE SCENE AND FOOD AND- I. YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT THE YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOURSELF- HAVE FOUND. YOU KNOW CREATIVE WAYS. TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND I'M HOPING THAT. YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THE. AND BEYOND THAT THAT NEED HEALTH CARE NOW MORE THAN EVER ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS. A YOU KNOW AND- IN THE FALL WERE EXPECTING A COVETED TO RAMP UP AGAIN. I REALLY WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING HEALTH CARE. BEYOND YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS. AT A TIME WHERE WE CAN REALLY GET CREATIVE AND REALLY- PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR OUR- OUR OUR SENIORS THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO COMMENT ON IS THE- THE CLINIC FUNDING AND- I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE- THE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE AND- I'M ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE. OR HEAR FROM FROM PEOPLE IN THE DISCIPLINE MY DISTRICT- TALK ABOUT- LAYOFFS AND- REDUCTION IN HOURS AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONE. CLINIC AND IN AN AREA FOR AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THAT THAT'S- BAD A MAJOR IMPACT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S- A CONVERSATIONS ABOUT TELL HELPFUL IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY WORK SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT- THE OTHER THING IS THAT IT COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES I THINK. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT AT AT LEAST IN MY SENATE DISTRICT AND I CAN IMAGINE BEYOND. THE ENTIRE STATE. I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED THIS TONIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU MADE IT IN TERMS OF CORPORATE AND- IT WHETHER OR NOT TO- FOLKS ARE YOU KNOW. GOING INTO THOSE PLACES BUT- THE REALITY IS THAT- I THINK THAT THAT OUR OUR AGENT COMMUNITY DESERVES TO LIVE IN DIGNITY. AND THIS THIS THEY WANT AND- I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR. AND THEN LASTLY OFONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT IS. AS AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. TO ELIMINATE THE SENIOR PENDLETON THE MEDICAL PROGRAM I. AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR LOW INCOME SENIORS AND- JUST OVERALL OUR SENIORS AND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S YOU KNOW TAKES MONEY AND THERE IS. A DEFICIT AND BUT I THINK THAT S. NOW IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET CREATED TO REALLY CONTINUE TO FIND AND EXPAND THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU SIR HELLO. RIGHT FROM. SO I'VE SAID SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND SOME COMMENTS AS WELL AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION TO THE PARK HEALTH CARE SERVICES- I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU ARE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE ENSURING THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN- TO CURRENTLY HAVE COVERAGE- CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT I DO I DO. YOU KNOW. YEAH WELL IT'S THAT'S A BIG CONCERN THAT- YOU KNOW THAT- PROPOSAL THAT WAS TO EXPAND COVERAGE UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF- BUDGETARY SITUATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON BEFORE IN TERMS OF SENIORS. WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED BUT I GUESS AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU LOOK AT THESE ISSUES CAREFULLY BUT NOW I AM STRUCK THAT- WE DO HAVE SEVERAL ITEMS HERE THAT IN MY MIND- BUT WE SAVE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO COMPARES WHAT'S THE COST OF THE ALTERNATIVE. SO THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAM AND SEA BASS YOU KNOW AND THIS IS P. PROGRAM AND WE HEARD A BIT OF A PRESENTATION EARLIER THIS YEAR- THESE ARE SENIORS THAT ACTUALLY- ARE ELIGIBLE AND WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO A NURSING HOME WHICH BY THE WAY MEDIC HOUSE ALSO PAYS FOR. IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- AND SO WE'RE CALLING ON ELIMINATING THAT PROGRAM AND WELL I THINK- APPRECIATE A NEW FOUND CONFIDENCE WE HAVE IN OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THAT WASN'T THERE- EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM SO- I AM LITTLE- I'M- SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE- MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS WILL BE ALSO IN THE GAPS AND THAT. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS WON'T END UP IN A NURSING HOME WHICH IT ACTUALLY COST US MUCH MORE- YEAH- THE SAME WITH CBS PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT ALSO HELPS KEEP PEOPLE OUT- WE'LL TALK ABOUT IHS US LATER SO WE WON'T TOUCH YOU KNOW WE'LL GET INTO THAT BUT THAT'S KIND OF SIMILAR QUESTION THERE- EVEN THREE SAMPLE. SUBSAMPLE WE ALSO HAVE NOT REALLY TO SENIORS BUT IN THE E. OURS- THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS IN THE E. OURS AND TO HELP WITH THEIR OPIOID CRISIS- AND I THINK WHEN WE HEARD THAT. PRESENTATION FR THAT INITIALLY. I THINK WE HEARD ABOUT HOW OLD THE RESEARCHERS PEOPLE HAD PILOTED THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY SAW COST SAVINGS. SO I AM CONCERNED THAT WE'RE MAKING CUTS- AND CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY CUT IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE CUTS BUT THESE ARE CUTS THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO GREATER EXPENSES. TO OUR STATE MOVING FORWARD- BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS WE'LL HAVE PATIENTS SHIFTED ESSENTIALLY FROM ONE PROGRAM OR FUNDING THAT WERE ELIMINATING OR CUTTING TO ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT. WE HAVE THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR AS WELL. SO IT I GUESS MY IS THAT- HOW DID THE DEPARTMENT EVALUATES A V. CUT THESE ARE THE OFFSET TO THE CUTS IN TERMS OF WHERE THESE PATIENTS MAY END UP I MEAN IT DID YOU RESUME THAT EVERYONE ON M. S. S. P. WOULD NOT END UP IN A NURSING HOME BECAUSE MANAGED MANAGED CARE WOULD PICK UP OR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF- THE SENIORS WHO ARE ON M. S. P. BY ELIMINATING IT WOULD END UP IN A NURSING HOME THAT WAS OUR PROJECTION MADE OF THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE A DECISION TO MAKE A CUT TO THAT ARE CENTRAL TO LIMIT THE PROGRAM FRANKLY. AND A PROPOSAL. HI SENATOR PAN SO- WE DID NOT SCORE ON ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS TIED TO- INCREASE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WITHIN THE BUDGET JUST TO BE CLEAR- I THINK. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH- THE MANAGED CARE PLAN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. AS WELL AS THE OTHER. I'M IN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. IN THE PROGRAM THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO TRANSITION PLANNING- OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH. AND WE DID NOT SCORE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND THEN WOULD NOTE- WE THE ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN WORKING ON. WHICH WE UNDERSTAND WAS NOT A PART OF THE MAY RELY A REVISED RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY- AND NOW THROUGH THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME. I'M EXPLORING THAT OPTION- FIRST STATEWIDE AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLEUNDERSTAND THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BE A B. BEYOND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WOULD BE AN ONGOING. BENEFIT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS THIS. IS WHY WE DID NOT SCORE THAT- BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT IN REGARDS TO THE VULNERABILITY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND IN IN THE PROGRAM- AND- THE DIGIT DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED DURING THOSE TRANSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT. END UP- YOU KNOW INAPPROPRIATELY IN INNISFIL NURSING FACILITY WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. OKAY SO- APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID I THINK THAT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY ASK IS THAT. WE NOT ELIMINATE THIS PROGRAM BEFORE WE SET UP THE OTHER PROGRAM SO I. HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFITS IT'S APPRECIATE ANNOUNCING IT LAST FRIDAY. I DO HOPE THAT- THAT ENDED YOU MENTIONED IF I WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED THAT EVEN ON A REALLY FAST TRACK UNTIL. THE THIS FISCAL YEAR BUT IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY IN THE SPRING OR MAYBE WE'RE REALLY LUCKY A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE SPRING- SO BUT I THINK THAT- THAT MEANS THAT WE SHOULD. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VET THIS MORE THOROUGHLY AS A SUBCOMMITTEE- SO PERHAPS NOT PUT THIS INTO THE MAY REVISE BUT- IN TERMS OF EXPECTING THAT IT'S I. BE THERE BUT FOR YOU KNOW WAS BEFORE. LEAVE SESSION AUGUST THAT WE HAVEN'T OF IT SOME OF THIS. MEANTIME THOUGH SOUNDS LIKE WE STILL NEED THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAM THAT HAPPENS. SO EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO PUT THIS THING IN PLACE. IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OR WHATEVER HAPPENS WE'RE STILL GONNA NEED PROGRAMS LIKE M. S. S. P. AND C. BASS. AND I DO THINK THAT. I THINK IT WOULD BE A REMARKABLE ASSUMPTION TO BE ACHE THAT. NONE OF THE PEOPLE WE ACTUALLY ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM JULY FIRST IS BEING PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE. THAT NONE OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO ACTUALLY. RECENTLY MSP ALREADY QUALIFY FOR BEING ADMITTED FOR LONG TERM CARE SERVICES WILL NOT END UP IN A NURSING HOME- I MEAN I THINK- EVEN EVEN WITH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE I'M SURE THAT- TRYING TO SAVE SOME OF THEM- THAT. NONE OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY END UP THERE AND CERTAINLY IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THERE SO I THINK THE COST OFFSET MAY TURN OUT TO BE- AS EXPENSIVE AS THE- THE ELIMINATION OF THE PROGRAM SO I DID. SO LET'S LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE PLACE THESE THINGS IN A WAY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T FALL IN THE GAPS- I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON PROP FIFTY SIX. SO WHEN PROP FIFTY SIX PASSED IN. WRAPS ELLIE- CAN COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE THERE WAS ORIGINALLY A PROPOSAL SOMETHING TO JUST ROLL PROPERTY SIX INTO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. AND I THINK THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WHO PASSED PROPERTY SIX. I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A BUDGET ISSUE THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK IT BUT I THINK SIMPLY TO ROLL IT BACK INTO- MEDICO. I MADE THIS CLEAR WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS CONTRARY TO WHAT THE VOTERS. EXPECTED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR- THIS REVENUE SOURCE AND- AND THAT'S WHY WE EVENTUALLY IS- LEGISLATURE AND- PREVIOUS GOVERNOR AGREED THAT WE WOULD- BASICALLY. THE SHIRT REDIRECT TO ORGANIZE THE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT- ADDRESSED WHAT THE VOTERS WANTED AND SO- PERHAPS ELLIE OKAY IT WOULD YOU CAN YOU COMMENT IS- THE REMARKS I MADE AND I THINK SOME OF YOU WERE AROUND AT THE TIME- IS. THE ACCURACY OF WHAT I AM SAYING IN TERMS OF THE WAY PROPERTY SIXES. IT WAS IT WAS- WRITTEN AND PASSED BY THE VOTERS AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VOTERS FOR PROPERTY SIX. BEN JOHNSON AGAIN WITH THE L. A. L. I THINK THAT DOES. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX- THE PIECE FOR MEDIC HAL IS- WRITTEN SO THAT IT'S IN YOU KNOW THE FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AL IS INTENDED TO INCREASE PAYMENTS. IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROPOSE- TO USE THAT TO OFFSET- GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM GENERAL FUND GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. AND ULTIMATELY A- AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED REALLY BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WOULD. PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE FUNDING AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FUNDING FOR PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES. WHILE ALSO PROVIDING SOME OF THE FUNDING TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM. AT THAT ARRANGEMENT WAS MAINTAINED FOR I BELIEVE ONE MORE YEAR BEFORE ACTUALLY ALL OF THE FUNDING HAS BEEN USED FOR PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES. US SINCE THEN- SO THERE IS SOME LEGISLATIVE THERE IS THERE IS A HISTORY OF USING IT TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTING GROWS. AND IT YOU KNOW WELL THERE IS A- THERE THERE CERTAINLY IS A NONSTOP PLANTATION CLOSET IN IN THIS PIECE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX- IT'S UNCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT. WE WOULD THE STATE WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE YOU KNOW OTHER. PAYMENT REDUCTIONS ABSENT YOU KNOW. BUT I'M USING THIS FUNDING TO OFFSET. GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM SO. NOW SUPPLICATION CLAUSES. SEEM OUR OUR OUR DIFFERENT TO EMPLOY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO ALWAYS ESTABLISH WHAT THE BASELINE IS BUT- YOU'RE RIGHT THAT SORT OF POINT OUT THIS THIS ASPECT OF THE SORT OF COMPLEX LEGISLATIVE HISTORY. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO WANT TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I WAS AROUND TWENTY TEN- THAT WE HAVE THAT YEAH WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET DEFICIT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PROP FIFTY SIX INTEREST. STRUCTURE WELL WE CERTAINLY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DRESSING SOME OF THE DEFICIT SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND IN MANY WAYS- BUT OBVIOUSLY ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO FOR THE- CURRENT BUDGET% SITUATION- BUT I THINK SIMPLY JUST ROLLING INTO MEDICARE OUT OF THE WAY THAT'S PROPOSED IS CONTRARY TO THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE- RESPECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WHEN IT COMES INITIATIVES. AND NOW MORE SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE ISSUES WERE RAISED. REGARDING PROP FIFTY SIX- I UNDERSTAND THAT- SINCE LEADERS- ELIMINATION OF THIS FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF PROP FIFTY SIX- IF I RECALL CORRECTLY WE ACTUALLY GET A NINE TO ONE MATCH FOR THAT- SO. EVEN WITH THE INCREASED F. MAP IF WE ROLL IT INTO THE OVERALL MEDICAL PROGRAM THE MATCH I BELIEVE DROPS IS. PERHAPS TEACH YES COULD COMMENT ON WAS THAT STATEMENT INACCURATE THAT WE ACTUALLY LOSING MATCH BY SHIFTING THE FUNDS FROM. FAMILY PLANNING IN HOUSE ORIGINALLY USED IN PROPERTY SIX AND- PREVIOUS YEAR TO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING NOW WE'RE GONNA BE ACTUALLY DECREASING AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MATCH WE'RE GETTING. FOR THOSE FUNDS SO- WE DO RECEIVE ON SOME SEARCH- SOME PLANT FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES A HIGHER AND HE ANSWERED F. MA'AM- AND- REALLY THE PROPOSAL WAS TO ELIMINATE ALL SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT- PIECES WITH THE FEW REMAINING PIECES THAT WERE- RESERVES THROUGH THE PROPERTY SIX WHICH BE IDENTIFIED AND BUT TURNED TO MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE. I OKAY FINANCE. I'M SORRY WE CAN'T YOU'RE STILL ON YOU TO OUR- J. OKAY THANK YOU HERE- JUST A LOT OF COMMENTS WITH THE- J. C. AND WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE FAMILY PLANNING AND WOMEN'S HEALTH PROGRAMS THEY WOULD BE A NINE TO TEN MATCH. OKAY SO AGAIN TO ME UNLESS YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU DON'T THINK FAMILY PLANNING'S IMPORTANCE AND I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE'RE REMOVING MONEY FROM THE SYSTEM- BY DOING THAT SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RESTORING THAT FUNDING- SINCE WE GET A- THIS IS TO GET BETTER MATCH AND CERTAINLY I THINK. THAT LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE TO TELL ME THAT THE DEMAND FOR THOSE SERVICES IS NOT THERE BUT I THINK AGAIN I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE AND I THINK MANY OTHERS WITH AS WELL SO I HOPE WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION- THE OTHER THING IS THAT YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE CASELOAD INCREASE AND WE HAVE THIS DISPUTE ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WILL GET BUT- BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT WITH THE CASELOAD INCREASE WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE PROVIDERS. HE JUST HAVE PREVIOUSLY HEARD FROM THAT WORK WE ACTUALLY HAVE BOTH EXISTING. WHO ARE SUFFERING FINANCIAL LOSSES AND ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT CLOSING DOWN THE PRACTICE IS 30% ACCORDING TO A CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION SURVEY. SAME TIME- YOU KNOW TRY TO GET MORE PROVIDERS IN MEDIC HOW- PAID THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT WE HAD IS PERHAPS ONE OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND GETTING A PROVIDERS TO TAKE MEDICARE WHICH IS STILL A FAIRLY POOR PAYER DESPITE THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE TO IT OVER THE YEARS THROUGH PROP FIFTY SIX THE ONES THAT WERE ELIMINATED BY THE WAY. PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. THE THINGS THAT. HELPED US BOLSTER. I MORE PROVIDER FOR NOW BUT- EVEN SO THAT ASIDE I UNDERSTAND THAT- FIRST COHORT WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED- ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR MINIMUM 30% MEDIC HOW THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF LIKE SIXTY OVER 60% MEDICAL PATIENTS- CERTAINLY OF. TREMENDOUS RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT- I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE HAD FUNDED AND YOU'RE PROPOSING FOR ELIMINATION COHORT TO THAT WOULD PROBABLY COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS BECAUSE THE FIVE YEAR REPAYMENT SO IN ANY ONE YEAR IT'S NOT GOING TO BE- ITS FIFTH ACT. SO TO ME IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A- GREAT YOU KNOW IT COULD CASELOAD INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE MEDIC HOW. WOULD YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MANY DOCTORS AND OTHER PROVIDERS- DENTISTS ADDRESS TO BE WILLING TO TAKE THE MEDICARE PATIENTS. BECAUSE THERE IT'S- THREE THAT'S DOESN'T MAKE SENSE- WELL LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO USE OUR MONEY SO- SHE WE TAKE IF WE IF WE USE THAT MONEY TO PAY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE LOAN REPAYMENTS- AND THEN YOU SPREAD OUT THAT REDUCTION DEAL THAT. THE LOSS OF THOSE I GUESS THAT REINVESTMENT AS FUNDS IN THAT OVER THE REST OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WHEN WE STILL COME OUT AHEAD. THE CONSIDERATION OF THAT. SO SENATOR PENN I DON'T KNOW THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE BUDGET REDUCTIONS PUT FORTH BY THE DEPARTMENT OUR DIFFICULT INDEED- JUST UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T VALUE OUR OUR PHYSICIANS AND OUR OUR WOMEN'S HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES- I THINK THEY WERE IT'S JUST DIFFICULT DECISIONS ACCORDING AND I THINK WE AND YOU KNOW PLAN TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE- OVER THE BUDGET DECISIONS AND I THINK FOR US WE WILL BE. YOU KNOW IT'S YES WE HAVE AN INCREASED LOAD AND IN IN THE PROGRAM AND WE WILL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES- IT WHICH IS WHY WE WILL HAVE A HEIGHTENED REPORTING PIECES TO MAKE SURE WE ARE WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY TO THIS PROCESS AND- DOCTOR GILBERT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO. A DAY AND I JUST WANNA SEE THE FOR DOCTOR BILLS WILL GO OVER SPEAKS IS THAT I KNOW I AGREE AND I YOU KNOW I SAID I WAS AROUND WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE CUTS BACK IN TWENTY TEN SO I'M NOT PROPOSING WE DON'T MAKE CUTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET BUT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT CUTS WE MAKE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WELL WHAT. WHAT ARE THE TRADEOFFS RIGHT SO THAT A TRADE OFF A NINE TO ONE MATCH TO A ONE POINT SOMETHING MATCHING LIKE WELL SHOULD WE KEEP THE NINE A ONE MATCH UNLESS THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE GETTING NINE ONE MATCH OUR SERVICES WE NEED RIGHT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING OUR- CAN YOU SAY WELL FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY I GUESS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DIVIDED BY FIVE- YOU KNOW FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IS IT BETTER TO. BRING. PROVIDERS WHO CAN BUILD TAKES. PERCENT PLUS MET. NOW GIVEN THAT CREAM CHEESE CAKE OR WELL USE THAT MONEY AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT REDUCE RATES QUITE AS MUCH- OR SOMETHING OR WHATEVER THE ALTERNATIVE NEST IN THE MONEY ON SO IT IS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF TRADE OFFS ARE MAKING AND OBVIOUSLY THAT ARE ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VALUES AND I THINK IT'S THE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU KNOW THE- THAT- OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT AND- THAT STARTS TO PURR AND- AND- DOCTOR GILBERT ARE. ARE DOING- BUT I DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY NOT SAY THAT WE CAN'T WE DON'T WE'RE NOT GONNA CUT ANYTHING I'D PREFER IF WE DIDN'T I KNOW YOU WOULD PREFER WE DIDN'T BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GETTING FOR THAT CUT RATE SO WE CUT. M. S. S. P. THEN HOW MANY PEOPLE IN A NURSING HOME IS THAT ENOUGH DO WE END UP WITH FINANCIALLY BETTER OFF OR NOT IN TERMS OF ALSO GETTING THE SERVICES SO I GUESS THAT THOSE ARE REALLY THE DIRECTIONS OF MY QUESTIONS. AS WELL AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW ROUND PROPERTY SIX FEATURE WE STICK TO WHAT THE VOTERS WANT SO. A DOCTOR GILBERT DID YOU HAVE A- DO YOU WANT TO COME. ON THAT. YEAH I REALLY. THE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT TRADE OFFS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT. I WOULD MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS IN TERMS OF THE NETWORK I MEAN ONE IS THAT. C. H. CF- SURVEY DID SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A REAL RISK OF- PC PEAS YOU NO PROBLEM. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR- THEIR PRACTICE. WE'VE NOT SEEN THAT VOLUME OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. CLOSE YOU KNOW WE ARE TRACKING ON A DAILY BASIS SO- FOR EITHER BECAUSE OF CAPITATION. OR SOME OF THE THINGS THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE DOING. TO YOU KNOW. GIVE GRANTS. CHANGE THEY PAY. PAY MORE QUICKLY YOU KNOW ENHANCE THEIR CAPITATION THAT'S- IN JANUARY TO PRESERVE THE NETWORK. ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME HEALTH PLANS THAT I'VE- WORKED IN THIS AREA AND I'VE DONE. DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT SOLUTIONS TO THEIR- PROGRAM- BUT REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT TRADE OFFS BOTH ON THAT- AND THE RISK OF. INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW GETTING SICK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE CERTAIN PROGRAM SO WE JUST WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU- PARTICULARLY AROUND. AREAS LIKE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY PREPARE PRE SHEET THAT- I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- WELL WE HAVE MAY NOT HAVE SEEN PRACTICES ACTUALLY. CLOSE HELLO. BY MY FAMILY MY WHAT MY WIFE IS PROVIDER AND SO YOU KNOW EACH PASSING WEEK AND I WAS TRYING TO HANG IN THERE AND- AND I THINK THAT- AT LEAST I'M HEARING FROM PROVIDERS BUT ALSO HAVING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES LIKE. EACH PASSING WEEK WE'RE LOSING A LITTLE MORE AND WE'RE HANGING ON A LITTLE LESS SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KINDA HANGIN IN THERE BUT THEIR SITUATION IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. I DO APPRECIATE BY THE WAY DTS- WORKING WITH THE MEDICARE PLANS TO REALLY TURN AROUND TO GET THOSE PAYMENTS OUT AND SO FORTH. AND I HOPE THE COMMERCIAL PLANS CAN DO THE SAME- ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. BECAUSE THAT DOES IT'S OUR LIKE SOMEONE SLIPS SLOWLY SLIDING. OFF THE CLIFF ND ARE HANGING ON BY THEIR FINGERS AND ONE FINGER STARTING TO SLIP NOW SO YEAH THEY HAVEN'T SOLVED THE PHONE YET THIS TIME IS GOING ON I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A CASCADE. AND IF WE DON'T ACT AND TRY TO PREVENT THAT. FROM HAPPENING I DO APPRECIATE DTS. THE DRESSING THE FLOW I TRY TO MOVE HIM UP FROM MUCH MORE. TURNING AROUND CLEAN CLAIMS SO. THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY VERY HELPFUL. HEY THERE'S SO MANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO ASK BUT WE ARE LIMITED IN TIME I THINK THERE'S A PRIDE THAT MAJOR ITEMS I WANT TO. TOUCH ON- YEAH WE TALK ABOUT PRACTICES HOSPITALS AS WELL. AS THEIR CHALLENGES AS WELL I UNDERSTAND IT WAS SOME PROPOSAL TO. CAP THE- PAYMENT TO HOSPITALS WHICH I THINK IT WAS GONNA BE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SPECIFICALLY PARDON ME REVISE. BUT LET'S- MAYBE I'LL JUST QUICKLY TOUCHING. AGAIN. ON THREE FORTY B. REAL QUICKLY. THE AGAIN HIGH YOU GET IT YOU KNOW WE HEARD THE PRESENTATION ORIGINALLY HINGE AND JANUARY IT'LL SAVE THE STATE GENERAL FUND. BUT THE COST OF THAT IS ACTUALLY PULLING EVEN MORE MONEY OUT OF SIR THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR PATIENCE FROM- I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BEFORE. AND IN FACT IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL- DIVERSITY OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FULL HELP MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT- THIS MONEY WAS GOING TO BE PULLED OUT OF CLINICS AND HOSPITALS AND OTHER. PROVIDERS FOR SERVICES FOR PATIENTS. BUT I THINK THE- THE ELIMINATION STEP ON PAINFUL AND- AND SHIFTING IT OVER WELL CERTAINLY HAS GENERAL FUND SAVINGS. THAT HAS A MUCHLARGER NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TOTAL OVERALL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR. ASIANS ON MEDICARE OUTSIDE DID WANT TO RAISE THAT ISSUE AS WELL- BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A PARTICULAR CONCERN. OF MINE IN TERMS OF SAYING WHAT KIND OF SNOW WHAT'S THE TRADE OFF AGAIN SO WHAT ARE WE TAKING OUT WHAT WE GETTING FOR WHAT WE'RE TAKING OUT NOW MILLIE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY THAT DEPENDS ON WHO GETS THE MONEY SO- SO. I JUST WANT TO DEPEND ON THAT AS WELL. OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AROUND DCS OKAY. HELLO AGAIN THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I KNOW IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME- AND I KNOW DTS IS THAT RIGHT YES THE COVER OF A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND PROBABLY IN COMING UP FROM THERE. AND HALF OF ALL KIDS AND DELIVERIES- APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR ON GOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. THE MEDICAL. AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE OVERSEEING SO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CANADA IS A STATE WE LOVE ALL OUR CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE I THINK THIS IS THE ONE THAT- THIS DEPARTMENT- YOU ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE SCOPE OF IT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT APARTMENT WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO SO- WELCOME INTO THE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- FOR. THE MAYBE VICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH JEFFERSON. AND BUT COMMITTEE MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE DURING THAT TIME IN PARTICULAR YOU'RE CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL REFLECTION ON OUR BUDGET AND QUESTIONS THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO ANSWER THEM I'M GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO OUR- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF- ADMINISTRATION BRANDON NEWNESS AND HE'S GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT. ARE YOUR BANKING YOU HEAR ME YES. PERFECT SO QUICKLY THE FIRST FOUR QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA ADDRESS ARE FOR UPDATES TO THAT WE HAVE IN OUR DEPARTMENT- OUR AGE DRUG SYSTEMS PROGRAM ARE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN PROGRAM LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION AND OUR GENETIC DISEASE SCREENING PROGRAM FOR ALL OF THESE FOUR ESTIMATES REALLY WELL WE'VE DONE IT IN THE REGION IS JUST PROVIDED AN UPDATE AS IT RELATES TO MORE CURRENT% PROJECTIONS RELATED TO CASELOAD AND POSSIBLY BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE FOR AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THE MAYOR VISIONS PROJECTING UP FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS A SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR DECREASE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION- WHICH IS A TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS INCREASE. DECREASE RATHER- SENSE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THAT'S SERVING CLIENTS OF ABOUT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND AND 360-004-1920 AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE RESPECTIVELY- MOVING OVER INTO OUR WICK PROGRAM AGAIN NO MAJOR REVISIONS OTHER THAN JUST FLOATING COST AT THE EXPENSE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- WE'RE PROJECTING- ROUGHLY A BILLION DOLLARS. FOR BOTH NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE WICK ROGRAM- SERVES ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLIENTS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE THOUSAND CLIENTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY- ONE THING JUST TO HIGHLIGHT QUICKLY FOR THIS- GIVEN I MEAN OF COURSE. THE WORK ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT- WAS DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE STATE HOMEOWNERS GOING INTO EFFECT WE ARE WATCHING THIS- PROGRAM CLOSELY BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT THAT THE- CLIENTS- TO SEE THE CASE FOR THE INCREASE IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM AS MORE CLIENTS COME UNDER THE PROGRAM- SO WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT AND PROBABLY HAVE. A NEW ESTIMATE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR THAT REFLECTS KIND OF SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE. CURRENT SITUATION TANAMI. FOR THE MOVING ON TO THE GYM DISEASE SCREENING. AGAIN NO CHANGES CASE FOR THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION IN. HERE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION ALSO IN BUDGET YEAR- AND JUST A SLIGHT DECLINES- SERVING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CLIENTS ON- THIS PARTICULAR IS. ONLY GENETICALLY SCREENING PROGRAM. QUICKLY ON THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ESTIMATE- AGAIN. SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT OCCUR- IN THIS AREA ARE RELATED TO A PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET POINT IN TIME ALL WE'RE REALLY DOING IN A COUPLE OF AREAS IS- WE'RE DEFERRING SOME OF THE COSTS INTO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR AND SHIFTING SOME OF THOSE- SO WE HAD- A PROPOSAL IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO PROVIDE ABOUT- TO SUPPORT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POSITIONS ARE GONNA BE PHASED IN OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD OR SIMPLY SHIFTING THE PHASE IN OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE STILL GOING TO RECEIVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN BUT SOME OF THOSE COSTS WILL SHIFT INTO- THE BODY HERE AND SORRY INTO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. RESULTING IN ABOUT SAVINGS OF TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN ANOTHER PROPOSAL WE REQUESTED ABOUT FIFTY THREE POSITIONS REPORTER CENTRAL LOCATIONS BRANCH WE'RE STILL REQUESTING AND ARE GOING TO RECEIVE THE FIFTY THREE POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT THE COST TO SUPPORT THOSE POSITIONS WILL JUST BE SHIFTED OUT INTO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR RESULTING IN ABOUT SIX POINT FIVE MILLION IN SAVINGS. SO THOSE ARE QUICK UPDATES ON- BEFORE ESTIMATES WE HAVE IN THE DEPARTMENT- MOVING ON TO QUESTION FIVE THERE WAS A QUESTION RELATED TO SOME OF THE REVERSION THAT ARE OCCURRING IN OUR BUDGET SPECIFICALLY SUMMER VERSIONS FOR THE- SICKLE CELL DISEASE PROGRAM THE FORMER HEALTH STUDY. AND THE NON MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES FUNDING THIS WAS ALL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVEDIN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. SO A QUICK UPDATE ON THE FARM WORKER HEALTH STUDY WE RECEIVED. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THERE. ONE POINT. ROW ABOUT. WAS MEANT TO BE PROVIDED TO THE U. OF. MERCED TAK. IMPLEMENTING CONDUCT THE STUDY THAT MONEY WAS PUSHED OUT. THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S BEING REVERTED WAS ESSENTIALLY A STATE OPERATIONS HE'S HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT THAT WAS MEANT TO KIND OF SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL. BUT JUST CANCELING THE FUNDING RELATED TO THE STUDY ITSELF TO- UC MERCED HAS GONE OUT. FOR THE- DISEASE CIVIL TELL THESE PROGRAM RATHER- WE RECEIVED A ONE TIME FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE CENTER. FOR COMPREHENSIVE CARE AND DIAGNOSIS OF INHERITED BLOOD DISORDERS FOR THE BUDGET. TO IMPLEMENT THE NETWORK- PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS. ON THAT MONEY TO GO OUT AND DIDN'T THE PIECE THAT'S BEING REVERTED- IN THIS LANGUAGE IS SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AGAIN. ON A STATE OPERATIONS SIDE TO SUPPORT JUSTIN STATE OPERATIONS BRANDON MINISTRATION ACTIVITIES- FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY LAST TOUR VERSION WAS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED LAST YEAR. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROVIDED IN GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM- WE HAD SPENDING AUTHORITY AVAILABLE TO US ALL THE WAY THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME PLANNING RELATED TO THAT IN THIS FISCAL pREVERSION- WE'LL PUT THAT PROJECT. ON HOLD. TO QUESTION NUMBER SIX RELATED TO SOME FUNDING THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AND THE MAYOR VISION FOR A CHILDHOOD LEAD. POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAM- BACK A FEW BUDGET CYCLES AGO I BELIEVE IT WAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN- WE RECEIVE SOME FUNDING FOR SOME- POSITIONS TO EXPAND OUR CHILDHOOD LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM- AS WELL AS SOME FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO ARE PARTNERING WITH THE FIFTY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. BUT ALSO PROVIDE- PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR US- WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING IN THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET REQUEST IS SIMPLY- THOSE THOSE. THOSE DOLLARS WERE LIMITED TERM ESSENTIALLY INITIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS JUST TO EXTEND THOSE DOLLARS PERMANENTLY. AND THEN ANOTHER TWO POINT- ONE MILLION DOLLARS- AND IS BEING REQUESTED TO ADDRESS- SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE- CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITORS TWENTY NINETEEN ON A REPORT- TO ADDRESS THOSE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS- SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA OF. RESPONDING TO INCREASE CASELOAD AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- REQUIRING ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL FORSMAN BY LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AND THE MORE ROBUST EVALUATION WORK- HERE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THIS TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS WILL ESSENTIALLY HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE FINDINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED. IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORTS. MOVING TO QUESTION NUMBER SEVEN U. S. QUESTION ABOUT THE AUGMENTATION FOR THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR THE CENTER FOR LABORATORY SCIENCES WILL APPROVE STAGE TESTING CAPACITY- WE REQUESTED FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUNDIN THE MIRROR VISION TO SUPPORT LAB CAPACITY IN OUR RICHMOND LAB. SIMILAR TO THE CHILDHOOD LEAD PROGRAM THIS WAS ALSO COMBINING THAT WE RECEIVED BACK I THINK IT WAS IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT. THE POSITIONS WERE PERMANENT BUT THE- THE DOLLARS THAT WERE SUPPORTING THOSE POSITIONS WERE LIMITED TERM THIS FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE SUPPORT FOR THOSE POSITIONS. AS WELL AS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. TO ENHANCE OUR LAB CAPACITY OUT THE RICHMOND LAB PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SOME PROBABLY THE INSTRUMENT AND SUPPLIES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO. HELP INCREASE OUR- TESTING CAPACITY FROM ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY. TO ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY. AND THEN FINALLY WITH QUESTION NUMBER EIGHT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AS WE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THE HEARING ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS RELATED TO- LOANS WE DO HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT LOANS IN OUR AREA THE ONE THAT'S ASKED FOR IN THIS QUESTION RELATED TO NUMBER EIGHT IS THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOAN FROM OUR AGE DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- I THINK FINANCIAL ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RELATED TO LONGER PAYMENT- FOR US THIS PARTICULAR FUND- DOES HAVE A HEALTHY RESERVE WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY IMPACT ON THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF THIS FUN PROVIDING A LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND- FOR THE JUST PARK THERE. AND THEN WITH QUESTION NUMBER NINE- WE HAVE OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. AUSTRALIA COME UP REAL QUICKLY. THANK YOU. YEAH AND I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU CAN HEAR ME I CAME HERE FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO BE TODAY REGARDING AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND THAT TODAY MAY TWENTY FOURTH WHICH MARKS THE FOURTH MONTH BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I'M ON BEHALF OF THE KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH AND TWENTY- ACTIVATED OUR MEDICAL HEALTH COORDINATION CENTER.

THEY BEGAN DOING WELL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO I'M TRAINING TO ALL OF OUR FACILITIES PARTICULARLY ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. YOU KNOW A LOT OF EXTRA INFORMATION AS FAR AS HOW TO DON DON. AND USE PVC CORRECTLY- AGAIN THE CALL THAT. IN ADDITION TO BEING. THE WEATHER R. THAT WEEKEND THOSE IN FEBRUARY WE ALL ATTENDED TO REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO OUR IMPACT CONTROL RIGHT. AND BEING THAT WE CAN JUST INFECTION AND OVERNIGHT OUT OF THIN AIR WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND RE DIRECT SOME OF OUR STATE OUR END OF OUR AND WHAT MANY PEOPLE NOW IN OUR HAPPENS OR HEALTHCARE UNDERVALUATION ARE SAID AND TRAIN SOME OF THEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK UP THE PATH BUT THE BIG IP COMPETENCIES THEY CAN ALSO THEN. BE THE FACTION CONTROLLED BY TEAMS TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO ALL THE TECHNICALITIES OKAY NOW BREAK TO BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY CHANGE THAT EXPOSURE AND PROPERLY COHORT DOES WORK SAID THAT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH BARS JACKIE. I'M IN ADDITION TO THOSE TRYING TEAM WE ALSO AND FEBRUARY AND MARCH RE DIRECTED ALL SIX HUNDRED OF OUR HEALTHCARE EVALUATOR NURSES FROM DOING THEIR REGULAR. ONCE A YEAR AND YOU MAY HAVE ALTHOUGH INDIRECTLY ALL OF OUR FACILITIES I THINK WE TARGET OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PART FOR WHAT WE CALL. INFECTION PREVENTION RIGHT AND THEN FOR MADE FOR. BIG PLAY ON ALL OUR PARTNERS TRYING TO PREVENT OUTBREAKS BY ABLE GET TIME IT. AND TRY GOOD MORNING AGAIN THAT'S AT THE- PRIOR TO ANY KIND OF OUTBREAK WE HAD A HAD BOTH PREVENTS MATTER MEASURED BE PRO I. AS WELL AND ARE TRYING GOING OUT. STEEL TO HELP MITIGATE THAT YOU ALSO IN WE DECIDED WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK. OR FLAG SPACE CYBERSPACE FOR DOLLARS YOU CAN DELETE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TOGETHER WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS. TO CREATE OVER A THOUSAND EXTRA BED SPACE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY. AROUND EIGHT AND THOSE CAN BE USED FOR ABOUT A THIRD THERE IS A POPULAR SEARCH FIRST AS WELL AS THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF POSITIVE PATIENT CALL THE LEFT THERE ON INTEL THEY ARE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE TO WHETHER THEY COULD GO. BACK TO THEIR REGULAR RESIDENT IN ADDITION TO. IN APRIL. READ AND READ. THAT WE TO BE. THERE ON SITE. AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND HOW CAN WE START DAY. WHO MAY HAVE BEEN OUT AND MAY HAVE- THAT NEED. SO WE DECIDED TO START A AN ONLINE DASHBOARD. WE HAD. THE LEAD MANDATORY REPORTING THE BRAND NEW ON PC. YOU OVER. JACK AND ARE. AFTER BE ABLE TO DEAL OR SPENT THIS WHITE HOUSE COME IN PATIENTS THEY HAVE HOW MANY HOW IT CONTRACTUAL. GENTLE PATIENT THEY HAVE AS WELL AS INFORMATION ABOUT P. P. E. RESOURCES AFTER YOU READ FOR. WHAT THE SITUATION AT FOR THE HEALTH CARE WORKER. THE DAILY REPORT BY NOON AND WHEN THEY REPORT IT POPPED UP ON A CALIFORNIA MAP DASHBOARD IT'LL EITHER POP UP AT A RED LIGHT OR GREEN LIGHT THE POP OF THE RED LIGHT THAT OUR STAFF IMMEDIATELY IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE. WILL CONTACT THE FACILITY TO SEE WHAT IS THAT URGENT NEED AND WHAT IS GOING ON THE FACILITY THEY ALSO CONDUCT ON SITE IN THE IMMEDIATELY. THE ISSUE IP TRAIN ISSUE THAT MAY NEED. AMERICAN ALL MAKE A REFERRAL TO OUR AGE I DRINK THAT THAT. IT THERE ARE ANY STAFFING OR P. P. AND THEY NOT TRACK HELP THEM MAKE A BIG PROPERLY HOW THIS REQUEST GO OUT THROUGH THE MARKET. DEMAND SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE THEN PARTICIPATE- HISTORICAL COMPLIANCE HISTORY. AND MAKE A LOGARITHM WITH INFORMATION FROM BOTH HISTORY AS WELL AS THE CURRENT INFORMATION WE WERE GETTING FROM THESE DAILY DASHBOARD. TO BE ABLE TO CREATE KIND OF A RUDIMENTARY- PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. AND SO WE BASICALLY BASED OFF OF ALL THE INFORMATION WE ACQUIRE WE DON'T HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A HIGH RISK LET NOT HIGH RISK LET'S GET THAT OUT EVERY DAY. AND YOU ARE JUST ADOPTED IN A CONTACT WITH THE DELETE MAY BE AT HIGHER RISK CATEGORY IF I TRANSLATE WITHOUT RIGHT INTENTIONALLY HAVE. ID ISSUE. AND THAT AGAIN THE RESULTS THAT. YOU WANT BY BACKTRACK ALTHOUGH IN ME WE CAN PAINT EVERY. THAT HELPFUL AND YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT THESE OUTBREAKS. KILLER THINK THAT THE ONLY. NOT A CALIFORNIA ISSUE THE NATION ON ISSUE. AND MET WITH THE DOES GOD WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING AND CREATIVE WAY THAT WE CAN EVEN CHANGE THE QUALITY AND. OVERSIGHT PROCESS. THEY AT THE END IT IS VERY IN IN SEEING THERE ARE A CHANCE HIGHER DO YOU THINK GOING FORWARD AND INDUSTRY WITH THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WE RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT PANDEMIC SHOULD HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE GAP AND BETTER- THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO HANDLE INFECTION PREVENTION AS WELL AS OUR NATION WIDE APPROACH TO DOING IT LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION AND. QUALITY IN THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS. I OKAY. IS REALLY A DEVICE. SIX NEW STRATEGIES AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIES WILL REALLY KIND OF OVERHAUL AND REFORM HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE P. OVERSIGHT- AND- KIND OF HIGH LEVEL I WOULD BE. DOING AND HAPPY TO GO AND I KNOW WE'RE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME HERE BUT I CAN DEFINITELY GO INTO THOSE BIG STRATEGIES AND OR ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WELL MAYBE WHAT WE'LL DO IS APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE VERY SHORT ON TIME AND- SO WHAT I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- IT WILL GO. ON AND COMES FROM LA. CONSIDER BALANCE ON YOUR CREDIT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I HAVE JUST THREE BRIEF COMMENTS- THE FIRST IS ABOUT THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH IS ON THE AGENDA. IT WASN'T DISCUSSED AS SPECIFICALLY VIA THE QUESTIONS. I'M AS YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM MAKES EFFORTS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS AND INFANTS AND- MOTHERS AND INFANTS IN OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. WE ALSO NOTE THIS TIME A COUPLE. DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT REMOVING FOR DOING IT OR A PROGRAM THAT. INTENTIONALLY PLAYING IMPORTANT ROLE AT THIS. OUR SECOND COMMENT HAS TO DO WITH THE LABORATORY- THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR THE CENTER FOR LABORATORY SCIENCES AND WE JUST SIMPLY WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO SEEK FEMA FUNDS FOR ELIGIBLE COSTS AT LEAST IN THE FIRST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN OUR FINAL COMMENT WOULD JUST BE RELATED TO SOME OF THE SMALL LOANS FROM SPECIAL FUNDS AND- THAT SERVE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THERE ARE THREE- SPECIAL FUNDS THAT WOULD PROVIDE THREE MILLION EACH TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND THESE THREE FUNDS ARE EACH RUNNING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND WHILE THEIR FUND BALANCES IT APPEARED TO BE ABLE TO EASILY ACCOMMODATE THE LOANS IN THE BUDGET YEAR- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS IN THE OUT YEARS IF- IF THOSE DEFICITS. RESULTING A SHORTAGE OF FUNDING SO THAT YOU KNOW SHORT OF REPAYMENT OR OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS- THAT COULD BE A CONCERN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FINANCE. THE GENTLEMAN FINANCE- FIRST ALL DRESS THE- THE LOAN SITUATION IN TERMS OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT- OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THE SMALLER ONES. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TOWARDS OUR REPAYMENT PLANS. IN LIGHT OF. FUTURE FISCAL CONDITIONS AND IF THERE ARE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO PROGRAMS I JUST POINT. THERE'S LIMITED. TO THE PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AND AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT OF THIS THE SECOND REQUIREMENT AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WE LOOK FORWARD TO- THROUGH PAYING EIGHT APOLLON. I ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS AMENDED ARCHITECTURAL SPECIAL LANGUAGE AS REGARDS. CURRENT BUYERS REALLY FIND ANOTHER FEDERAL FUNDS MAY COME INTO ALI AND TURN THE REVIEW BY THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW THAT SO THAT WAS A CONCERN OF LEGISLATURE WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU. ON THAT MATTER. THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. IT'LL RUN A ROLL BACK OF A TWENTY NINETEEN PROPOSAL. RAMS STILL BE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER IN TERMS OF TOTAL RESOURCES THEN. SHE TWO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'M NOT NOT SOMETHING WE COURSE. EXCITED ABOUT DOING BUT LOOKING AT THAT OVERCOMES BUDGET PROBABLY THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES WHERE TO FIND GENERAL FUND SETTINGS AND THIS IS A HARD CHOICE. THANK YOU. QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SIR DAUDA. THANK YOU MR CHAIR JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS OVER THE REDUCTION FOR BEATING UP BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM AND DIED YOU KNOW I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT FROM WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- DURING COVERT- YOU KNOW pCOMMUNITY AND NOW WE'RE LEARNING THAT EVEN CHILDREN ARE BEGINNING TO. HAVE AT COVERT RELATED IMPACTS TO THEIR HEALTH I THINK THAT THIS IS NOW MORE THAN EVER I'D NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND INVESTED IN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS. SERMON THIS I DO IT IN AN INTEREST OF TIME I WILL MAKE THIS VERY BRIEF I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE- THE TESTING OF STAFFING- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND- YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S MANDATORY IN EVERY FACILITY BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S- MORE THE LEAST HALF OF THE DEATHS AT THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACEIN CALIFORNIA HAVE. BEEN OF THOSE PATIENTS IN THOSE FACILITIES SO IF WE'RE NOT TESTING THEN HOW ARE WE CONTAINING AND CONTROLLING THIS VIRUS- AND THEN THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT MY COUNTY IS RECEIVING PATIENTS COVERED NINETEEN. POSITIVE PATIENTS FROM OTHER COUNTIES- WITHOUT ANY WARNING TO THE HOSPITALS WITHIN OUR COUNTY SO YOU KNOW PREPARATION IS KEY AND WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DASHBOARD. IS IT IS EVERY COUNTY REPORTEDLY ON A DAILY BASIS OR SOME KIND OF FALLING OFF THE GRID. THE END OF ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T MIND CENTERED ON THIS JUST BECAUSE MY QUESTION SIMILAR TO YOURS- SO YOU CAN ANSWER ALL ONE TIME. I THINK YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY ALSO IT'S ENGLISH ABOUT TESTING AND- PARTICULAR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AS WELL AS YOU KNOW BASICALLY DOING THE FULL CONTACT RACE ISOLATE- PROCESS FOR OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. THE ONLY TEST BUT THEN- CONTACT RESOLVES ITS GONNA BE WITHIN THE FACILITY IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE'S CLOSET AND THEN B. AND ISOLATE THOSE. PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE SO CAN YOU ADDRESS. WHAT'S BEING DONE AND ALSO PARTICULARLY WHAT FUNDING ARE YOU ALLOCATING TO THAT WHERE'S THE FUNDS GOING TO COME TO THE- TO DO THIS- AND OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE QUESTIONS. FIRST ON MAY ELEVENTH WE DID SEND OUT AN ALL FACILITIES LETTER REQUIRING THAT EVERY COLOR YOU CAN CONSOLIDATE- IN TWENTY ONE DAYS I HAD A FULL MEDICATION COLBERT CLAN ANY IN THAT PLAN THEY MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO. SPEAK ON HOW THEY'RE GOING TO CHAT AND IN THEIR PROPERTIES AND WHAT THEIR CASTING PLANT IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE DUE MAY THIRTY FIRST AND THEN AT THAT POINT OUR TEAM WILL GO OUT EACH ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES. TO WORK THROUGH THEIR ATTESTATIONS OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT THEY HAD MEDICAID CAPPING CREDIT TESTING. ALSO ON FRIDAY I JUST TWO DAYS AGO WE ARE OFTEN PREVENTED THE AUTHORITIES LETTER THAT. REVEALED WHAT THE CASTING CLAN AND REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR ALL THE DELETE AND ON CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY TO WORK. IN THE PHILIPPINES AND IN ROUTE PLANET DATE THAT WE WILL HAVE. A BASELINE TESTING. EVERYONE MUST HAVE ALL OF THEIR HEALTH CARE WORKERS BASELINE TESTED IT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND I WILL BE ONGOING ALTHOUGH FOR THE SURVEILLANCE TESTING AS WELL. THANK YOU SO THAT IS A RESPONSE OR TARGETED TESTING. SO THAT IS GOOD IS THERE ANYTHING JUST ONE CALL IT POSITIVE IN THE FACILITY WHETHER THAT IS A RESIDENT OR A HEALTH CARE WORKER YOU WANT AND REQUIRE THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THAT FACILITY. WHAT ARE YOUR HEALTH CARE WORKER WHO'S WORKING DIRECTLY WITH- PATIENT RESIDENT OR WHETHER YOU'RE SELLING AND ADMIN OR IN THE FACILITY FOR SOME THER REASON. BUT EVERYONE WOULD BE- CHAPTER. AND THEN COHORT APPROPRIATELY INTO KIND OF THREE FACTIONS YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR TRUE NEGATIVE YOU HAVE YOU'RE NOT. EXPOSURE WHICH WE WOULD HAVE A ONE SECTION BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WOULD BE TESTED AGAIN NEXT WEEK ABOUT THE DENTURE COMMENT. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO POP IT IN THEIR CORE CORE APPROPRIATELY. AND THEN ARE IN PAYMENT ON. OKAY SENSE THAT MANY OF OUR PATIENTS ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE DOES THAT MEAN MEDICARE WAS PAYING FOR IT. CORRECT. I JUST WANT US TO BE CONSCIOUS SINCE WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT ONE WE START SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS TO GO JUST ONE OTHER VERY QUICK QUESTION FOR THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEN. CONTACT TRACING I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNGER TRACING. TRAIN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHAT KIND OF FUNDING A RE IS ARE WE GIVING TO COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR CONTACT TRACING A STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT- FOR CONTACT TRACING. AND BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WAS IN THE MAY REVISE- SO. SO AGAIN. I THINK WE SHOULD BE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO BUDGET FOR THAT HOPEFULLY MOST OF ITS COMING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO BE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE- CONTACT RACING WE NEED FOR BOTH COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. HI THIS IS SUSAN TALLY I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY ON THE PROGRAM SIDE AND THEN. WORKING ON THE CONTACT RACING ON THE CULT LEADER CONTACT RACING MARK. SO. REPORT TALKED VERY WHAT WHILE I'M WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THIS ON BEHALF OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING- SPENDING DOLLARS TO HAVE A TRAINING PROGRAM- UCSF AND UCLA WE'RE ALSO BUILDING AND DATA MANAGEMENT- FEMININE DEPLOYMENT FOR THEM- AND LARGELY USING OUR FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE ARE GETTING FROM CDC FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE'RE STILL DETERMINING WHAT THE COUNTY'S EXACTLY WHAT PORTION OF THAT FUNDING WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTIES WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED THEM WITH ALLOCATION FROM THAT CRISIS GOING ON WHICH IS- FROM CDC. YEAH I'M ABOUT FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THAT PROGRAM AND ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION UNDER THE ELP GRANT WHICH WERE ABOUT HOW IT CAME OUT TO THEM OKAY WE ALSO ARE GETTING. ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT CONTACT RACING- MET LABORATORY AND THAT- TESTING SURVEILLANCE ON A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AS WE MOVE. TOWARDS A PROPOSAL OKAY SO I CERTAINLY WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR OUR TESTERS ISOLATE BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT WE CAN'T GET OUR ECONOMY BACK AND US. WE CAN GET ALLTHAT MONEY FROM THE FED'S THAT THE WONDERFUL BUT ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING STEPS WE NEED AND THAT WERE- THAT YOU'RE REPORTING BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND EVEN IF IT'SALL FEDERAL MONEY. EXACTLY WHAT RESOURCES ARE BEING PUT IN THOSE AREAS SO I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH OKAY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK AND- SAY THAT LOVE ALL MY AGENCIES BUT FOR THIS ONE YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SELF. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO. NEXT IS THE PART STATE HOW. AND I ASK YOU TO KEEP PRESENT VERY BRIEF. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE QUESTIONS. SO RE READY YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AND CHAIRS AND MEMBERS THIS IS STEPHANIE CLINTON AND DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND I JUST PROVIDE A REALLY BRIEF INTRO AND THEN GO RIGHT INTO THE QUESTIONS SO OVERALL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED A TOTAL BUDGET I'M FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR THAT DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS- OF TWO POINT TWO BILLION THAT WAS REVISED DOWN BY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION- WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE PARK OUR BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PROMOTE THE SAFETY. OF STATE HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND STAFF DURING COBIT NINETEEN WITH RESPECT TO CASELOAD AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE DO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE REFERRALS OUT HIS CAPACITY AS IT RELATES TO OUR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS ARE PROJECTED SENSORS- ENGINE THIRTY OTHERS INCLUDING OUR STATE HOSPITALS CONTRACTED PROGRAMS AND CONDUCT PROGRAMS IS- SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR SH AS OF MAY EIGHTEENTH AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PATIENTS AWAITING PLACEMENT IN A STATE HOSPITAL PROGRAM OF WHICH ELEVEN HUNDRED NINE WHERE INDIVIDUALS FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

AND ULTIMATELY THE CHANGES IN THIS PROPOSAL- WE RECOGNIZING- OUR SHIFTING PRIORITIES FOCUSED ON CURBING NINETEEN RESPONSE- AND- TO HELP ADDRESS THE GENERAL FUND DEFICIT WE ARE PROPOSING TO PHASE THIS PROJECT NOW. INSTEAD OF OVER THREE YEARS OVER A TOTAL OF FIVE YEARS- THE THERE WAS AFTER HOURS- SUPERVISING REGISTERED NURSE POSITIONS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. PHASE AND INTO YOUR CELLS WILL BE THREE YEARS AND THEN THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MEDICATION RAM PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO IMPLEMENT. OVER THREE YEARS WILL NOW BE FIVE YEARS. OKAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTION THANK FOR MUCH. ACCORDING TO SHIA LA- JUST A FEW JUST ONE COMMENT RELATED TO THE TREATMENT TEAM PROPOSAL- ONE OF THE POSITION TYPES THAT IS BEING REDUCED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS- PSYCHIATRISTS BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS STILL PROPOSING TO STAFF- A LARGE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS AT THE END OF THIS PROPOSALS- PHASE IN PERIOD- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE POSITIONS WOULD GO ON SALE. GO UNFILLED GIVEN THOSE DEPARTMENTS LONGSTANDING ISSUES WITH HIRING PSYCHIATRIST- SO THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO APPROVE THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BACK ON ITS ABILITY TO FILL THOSE VACANCIES OKAY THANK YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO BE SURE THAT. WE DON'T WE HAVE PEOPLE ALL RIGHT FINANCE. HE COMES FROM FINANCE HI. IRAN IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- ONE SMALL COMMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE ALLEY- THANK YOU COREY AND THE STATE HOSPITALS DOES PROVIDE A AN ESTIMATE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND I'M A REVISION.

COMMISSION CAN ASK YOU TO TRY TO KEEP YOUR PRESENTATION VERY BRIEF- JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF A TIME CRUNCH BUT CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT WHAT YOU DO. SO YOU AN JUST SPEAK TO HOW THE COVER THIS IMPACTED. COMMISSION IN TERMS OF- ALLOCATION. SIXTY THREE FUNDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT THE NUMBERS- IN TERMS OF THAT ISSUEWE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE- CURRENT FISCAL INCENTIVES AROUND MHSAA ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE COUNTIES TO SPEND MY QUICKLY. AND THE POLICY REALLY FOCUSES ON LONG TERM LONG TERM PLANNING FRAMEWORK WE'RE CONCERNED THAT CURRENT PLANS MAY NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF BOTH- ORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITIES RECOGNIZING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY AND OPERATIONAL REALITIES IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER CARE IN WAYS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED IN THE PLANS THAT ARE TOGETHER. THAT THAT IS ALSO TRUE FOR THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FINDS THAT THE COMMISSION MAKES AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES- THIS COMMITTEE'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN THE PAST FEW YEARS FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE ABOUT TO RELEASE SCHOOL NO HEALTH SIGNS THOSE PLANS WERE PUT TOGETHER THROUGH A COMPETITIVE R. F. P. THAT WAS DONE AT THE VERY END OF THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE SCHOOL REALITY FOR EXAMPLE. MAY NOT MATCH THE PLANT THE PROPOSALS THAT THAT TAPPED JOHNNY'S ON THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS PROVIDED THE COMMISSION SIMILAR CONCERNS AROUND THESE DROP IN CENTRE FINDING OUR TRIAGE FINDS. THE FULL ARRAY LOCAL ASSISTANCE FINDS THAT WE ARE MAKING AVAILABLE TO THE COUNTIES THAT THAT THAT MONEY IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTIES. AND WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A MECHANISM TO ALLOW THE STATE TO ADAPT THOSE CONTRACTS IN WAYS THAT CAN BRING THEM UP TO DATE WITH THAT AGAIN BOTH THE FISCAL ME OPERATIONAL REALITIES THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING. WERE ALSO WHAT WE ARE SEEING SOME TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER PARTNER WITH OUR COUNTY IS WE'RE DOING SOME GREAT PARTNERING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AGING STATE HOSPITAL STATE CSPD PEOPLE REACHING OUT FIRST FIVE. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED AGAIN AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF COUNTY SCHOOLS ARE CDOS AND OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS IN TERMS OF SUICIDE PREVENTION WOULD BE IMPORTANT. AS WE ADJUSTED TO THE RIGHT IT IS THE CANCER TO FACE. AGAIN BOTH FOR COVETED THE- UNCERTAINTY THAT WE FACE. YEAH ABOUT AS BRIEF AS I CAN BE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY YOU MIGHT HAVE OKAY THANK YOU LMAO COMMENTS. WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR CONCERNS AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT FINANCE. WE ARE ALMOST A PERSONAL FINANCE WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TODAY BUT WE ARE REVIEWING THE REQUEST AND I HAVE HAD INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMISSION AND SENATE STAFF. OKAY THANK YOU. ACCORDING TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OKAY I GUESS I JUST DID IT. COULD COME IN TERMS OF- CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE COMMISSION TO. FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATING MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO BETTER ADAPT REALIZING THAT SERVE THE GROUNDS CHANGED OUT FROM UNDER. AND IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS AND SO- LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS IN THAT REGARD- MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE SOMETHING INTO THE G. JUNE BUDGET BUT PERHAPS WHEN WE AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET. IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AS WE MAKE FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS PERHAPS TO BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE WORK AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH CERTAINLY IS GOING TO. IT'S NOT A IT'S WELL IT'S- A MELT THE MANTLE THE EXPANDED OVER TIME SO I UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO COVERED CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFIT EXCHANGE. OKAY WELL COME. ASK YOU TO. KEEP THE PRESENTATION BRIEF. HELLO. BACKGROUND YOU NEVER KNOW HOW FAR YOU GO OKAY YOU'RE HERE YOU. VERY GOOD I THINK I THINK THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS- FOR HAVING US. AGAIN I DID NOT COVER CALIFORNIA QUALITY ELIGIBILITY IN RESEARCH DIVISION I'LL BE COVERING THE SPEECH SUBSIDY PORTION AND YOU'RE JOINED TODAY WITH MY COLLEAGUE KELLY GREEN DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND WILL DEFER TO HER ON THE TRAILER BILL CLARK- PORTIONS. OF OUR ITEM- YOU WILL TRY TO HIT THE QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS IN THE PREPARED REMARKS SO- BUT DON'T HESITATE COURSE TO INTERRUPT ANY PLACE WE CAN ADD ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION. JUST A REMINDER THAT I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS BUT AGAIN ASKED THAT TRY TO KEEP THE ANSWER IS VERY BRIEF SO THANK YOU. YEAH FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PLAN YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED NEW STATE SUBSIDIES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL HELP TO PAY PREMIUMS FOR CONSUMERS TO ENROLL THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET I MEAN THIS INCLUDED FIRST IN THE NATION SUPPORT TO CONSUMERS WHO EARN BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND AND JUST OVER THAT ELIGIBILITY LIMITS FOR THE FEDERAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SUPPORTS A CHANGE TO THE NEW FINANCIAL HELP THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE MANDATE TO COVER COVER CALIFORNIA SAW NEW SIGN UPS JUMP BY OVER 40% IN THE TWENTY TWENTY OPEN ENROLLMENT. PERIOD OUR- EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU THAT OPEN ENROLLMENT ALSO SAW. OVER SIX HUNDRED. CONSUMERS CHOOSE A PLAN AND BENEFIT FROM THE NEW STATE SUBSIDIES. IN PARTICULAR THE PROGRAM IS HAVING A DRAMATIC IMPACT FOR CONSUMERS BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED PERCENT. WHERE WE SAW ENROLLMENT OF OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS. WHO ARE RECEIVING ON AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. I WILL- ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. KEEP IN MIND THAT BASED ON THE ELIGIBILITY CURVE THAT WAS SET FOR THE PROGRAM BY THE COVER CALIFORNIA BOARD. OF THESE CONSUMERS EVEN AFTER THE SUBSIDIES ARE STILL SPENDING BETWEEN TEN AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT. OF THEIR- ANNUAL INCOME ON PREMIUMS IT'S REALLY A REFLECTION OF HOW HIGH THE COST OF COVERAGE THEY WERE FACING WAS BEFORE THIS PROGRAM. WHILE THE ESTIMATED ENROLLMENT AMONG THOSE WHO EARN LESS THAN STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. TRACKED PRETTY WELL TO WHAT WAS ESTIMATED ORIGINALLY. TAKE UP IN THE FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED GROUP HAS BEEN BOTH PICK UP AND- A GENERAL UNDERSTATEMENT THE SPENDING HAS BEEN LESS THAN WAS ANTICIPATED. THEY'RE REALLY TWO MAIN REASONS FOR THAT. FIRST THE TWENTY TWENTY ELIGIBILITY LEVELS WERE SET. BASED ON MODELING WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD SIGN UP OR HOW MUCH THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR. AND IF IT TURNS OUT BASED ON THE CURVE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD AND AGAIN THE LIMITS IN THIS EAR THAT YOU HAVE TO SPEND IF YOUR INCOME ON PREMIUMS TO BETWEEN TEN AND 18% OF YOUR INCOME. IT TURNED OUT THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE CONSUMERS WHO ENROLLED BETWEEN. FOUR HUNDRED AND 6100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY ARE ALREADY% ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE THAT. COSTS LESS THAN THAT CUT OFF AT TEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AND AS A RESULT THOSE CONSUMERS WERE NOT ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM A NEW STATE SUBSIDIES. THE SECOND REASON THAT ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN LOWER IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO EARNING THIS INCOME RANGE. ABOUT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE OFFER EXCHANGE AND COVER CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD SWITCH TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE SUBSIDY ON EXCHANGE AND THAT REALLY BY AND LARGE HAS NOT HAPPENED. WE SEEN THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF OPEN ENROLLMENT WE WERE WORKING WITH OUR INSURER PARTNERS AND BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO IDENTIFY SOME INTERVENTIONS TO ENCOURAGE. THOSE CONSUMERS TO TAKE UP THE THIS NEW FINANCIAL HELP. BUT WE HAD TO PUT THOSE EFFORTS ON HOLD IN LIGHT OF THE PAINT ENDEMIC. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ESTIMATES IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DO ANTICIPATE OUR RENEWAL OF THOSE EFFORTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE OPEN ENROLLMENT. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK TO MAKE SURE ALL CALIFORNIANS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SUBSIDY CAN BENEFIT. ONE ISSUES REALLY HAVE HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE DURING THE RECESSION WHEN TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE FINDING THAT THEIR INCOME. IS LESS THAN EXPECTED IT WOULD BE RECALLED THAT IN BOTH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNDER THE FEDERAL RULES IN THE STATE THAT'S THE PROGRAM. IF YOUR INCOME ENDS UP LOWER THAN YOU EXPECTED AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN YOU FIND THE FILE YOUR TAXES. YOU CAN ONLY CLAIM A STATE SUBSIDY OR OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR YOUR PREMIUMS RETROACTIVELY IF YOU ENROLLED THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE AND THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. I'M SO PLEASED TO ATTACKS TOGETHER. HAVE REDUCED STATE SPENDING ON ON THE STAGE OF THE PROGRAM AND ARE THE REASON THAT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL REFLECTS A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS RELATIVE TO WHAT WAS. INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET ENOUGH BECAUSE FOR THE MAY REVISE WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE ACTUAL ATTITUDES. INFLUENCED AND INFORMED BEST MAKE YOUR POLICY WE JUST LIKE FOCUS ON A VERY BRIEF ANSWER TO QUESTION. FOUR FIVE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT IS A TO CAN TO GROW PROGRAM. AND WITH REGARD TO. WE HAD AN ANTICIPATED THAT IN EARLY APRIL WHEN THE ESTIMATES WERE PREPARED THE PREMIUMS MIGHT INCREASE BY OVER 10% IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH CARE IS BEING DEFERRED WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT THE ESTIMATES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ARE FALLING ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE RECESSION GROWTH. TAKE UP MAYBE INCREASING AND WE CONTINUE NOW ON THAT ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE BUT WE EVERY FUN TIME AND THEN QUESTION NUMBER SIX I THINK IS- IS MISS GREEN GONNA BE ANSWERING. YEAH YES MATURE NUMBERS THANK YOU. ON QUESTION NUMBER SIX THIS IS AN ITEM THAT PERTAINS TO ACTUARIAL VALUE BRONZE PLANS THE COMMITTEE. HAD ASKED FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE NEED FOR THE TRAILER BILL ITEM AND 'LL TRY TO DO THAT DISTINCTLY. THIS ITEM WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IT IS NEW A NEW PROPOSAL FOR THE MAY REVISION. IN SUMMARY COVER CALIFORNIA IS THAT IT'S BENEFIT DESIGNS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLAN HERE. HOWEVER WITH RECENT UPDATES TO THE METHODOLOGY USED BY THE FEDERAL ACTUARIAL VALUE CALCULATOR WHICH IS. WHAT WE MUST USED TO CALCULATE THE ACTUARIAL VALUE OF OUR BENEFIT DESIGN. WE DISCOVERED THAT THE ACTUARIAL VALUE FOR STANDARD AND HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BRONZE PLANS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WILL NOT MEET THE ACTUARIAL VALUE TO MEN IN THIS RANGE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN STATE LAW. SPECIFICALLY FOR STANDARD BRONZE PLANS STATE LAW ALLOWS THE ACTUARIAL VALUE TO GO AS HIGH AS SIXTY TWO PERCENT. FOR HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BRONZE PLANS THEY CAN RANGE AS HIGH AS 64% AND ACTUARIAL VALUE. BUT BASED ON THE FEDERAL ACTUARIAL VALUE CALCULATOR FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE ACTUARIAL VALUE FOR BOTH OUR STANDARD AND HIGH DEDUCTIBLE BRONZE HEALTH PLANS WILL EXCEED. SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. AND THAT THEY WILL NOT COMPLY WITH THE ACTUARIAL VALUE DIMINISHED RANGE THAT SET IN STATE LAW. FROM PLANT DO NOT COMPLY WITH STATE LAW COVER CALIFORNIA CANNOT OFFER BRONZE PLAN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THAT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. WOULD SET THE MAXIMUM ACTUARIAL VALUE FOR ALL BRONZE PLANS AT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THIS IS IN CONFORMANCE WITH FEDERAL RULES- AND IT WOULD ALLOW COVERED CALIFORNIA BROWN PLANS TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. WITH THEM AND OFFERING FOR NEXT YEAR- I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING THAT THIS IS A SIMILAR ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH OUR- HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN- BRONZE PLANS. AND THERE WAS A SIMILAR FIXED MADE- THROUGH THE TRAILER BILL THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR- SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A- SIMILAR. SOLUTION THIS YEAR TO APPLY TO ALL OF THE ON PLANNED. ON AND NEED FOR. IS URGENT THAT TWENTY PLANNING ABOUT EVER UNDER WAY WITH THE GOAL. OCT RENEWAL I NEVER ONE ENROLLMENT OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT COMES FROM LA. YES SAID MR CHAIRMAN CHRIS MARTINELLI- JUST A VERY QUICK COMMENT WE REVIEWED THE SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IN COST FOR THE STATE PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM. IN FINDING THE- YOU JUST NEED TO BE TO BE REASONABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU FINANCE. YOU YES SIR NO COMMENTS OKAY RIGHT QUESTIONS YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY YES SIR MELINDA'S OUT YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION RELATING TO THE CLINICAL VOLUNTEERING VOLUNTEERING TRAILER BILL AND THIS LOOKS LIKE A POLICY BILL TO ME SO I'M WONDERING- WHY IT'S IN HERE. YES SENATOR KELLY GREEN COVER CALIFORNIA YES THIS ITEM IS- IT IS IN THE- PART OF THE BUDGET- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE- IF IT WERE TO BE ADOPTED THAT WOULD ASSIST US- IN RECRUITING- STAFF MEMBERS WHO WOULD WISH TO SERVE AT COVERED CALIFORNIA AND- WHO MAY BE. INHIBITED BY THIS PARTICULAR PROHIBITION FROM SERVING AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER UNLESS YOU'RE NOT COMPENSATED- WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF RECRUITMENT FOR A NEW CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER- AND SHOULD WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT MAY HAVE ASSISTED US IN THAT RECRUITMENT- OKAY SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT IN CONJUNCTION CERTAINLY IS A PHYSICIAN WHO'S IN THE LEAD OUT. THAT MONEY CHALLENGES IS THAT BASICALLY THIS PROHIBITS A PHYSICIAN WHO IS SERVING AS NON COVERED CALIFORNIA FROM ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PRACTICE EVEN IF THEY WISH TO AS A VOLUNTEER EVEN THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. AND CERTAINLY GAIN COMPENSATION CAN RAISE THAT. THE ISSUE IS THAT BE EVEN JUST FALLEN AT COMMUNITY CLINICS TO KEEP THE CLINICAL SKILLS UP. THERE WE GO- I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK MINE IS JUST FROM MORE OF A PROCEDURAL ASPECT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE IT IN HERE BECAUSE IT. IT SEEMS VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S A POLICY BILLS HAS TRAINING UNDERSTAND- WHY WE'RE DOING IT THIS WAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION THANK YOU. APPLE IS RESHAPING THE FACT THAT OFTEN WE TALK POLICIES AND- BUDGETS OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS JUST ONE OTHER QUICK COMMENT FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA AND I THOUGHT WE TOUCHED ON IT. ON TEAMMATE C. AS WELL AS YOU KNOW BE SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORKS IS WE'RE CONTRACTING WITH PLANS SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T JUST HAVE A- DAY CARD FOR. THE PLAN BUT THEY ACTUALLY CAN SEE. SOMEONE FURTHER.

IN FINANCE SO- WELCOME PLEASE INTRODUCE YOUR NAME YOUR TITLE FROM THE PART OF AGING AND LOOK FOR TO YOUR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WE POSE ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS KIM ACQUIRE WEIGHT ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING. AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF I'M PLEASED WE ACTUALLY HAD OUR- USUAL BUDGET HEARING EARLY IN MARCH. BEFORE WE ALL ENTERED THIS. NEW AND DIFFICULT TIME. OTHER THREE QUESTIONS HERE FOR THAT APARTMENT EIGHT BEIJING ALL ABOUT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS THERE ARE TWO ELIMINATIONS. ARE WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP PARTNER- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THREE CUTS. QUESTION ONE FOCUSES ON THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM. ARE AT YOUR CORRECT SENATOR THIS IS AN ELIMINATION BOUT WOULD SERVE. I WOULD HIT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVED BY THIS PROGRAM SOME OF THE OLDEST YOU FAIL AS YOUR RECEIVING BOTH HEALTH AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. AT HOME I BELIEVE AS YOU HEARD AND DISCUSSED THIS MORNING- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THIS IS THAT. OUR OUR RESULTS SOLELY OF THE BUDGET PRESSURES PARTICULARLY ON MEDICAID ON THE APPROACH OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING AGENCY WIDE. TO REALLY FOCUS ON KEEPING ELIGIBILITY OPEN- AND IN MEETING THE NEW NEED WITH THE WITH THE RECESSION AND- LIMITING LIMITING AND ELIMINATING OPTIONAL BENEFITS. AND M. S. S. P. L. HER CATTLE DESIGNATION IS AN OPTIONAL. BENEFIT I. WANT TO CONTINUE TO OFFER QUESTIONS. THE ABSOLUTELY. QUESTION TO YOU. ABOUT THE DOCKING NEED FOR YOUR AND BY IT. AND THEY SENATOR WE AGREE HOW THE OLDER MAN ACT PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS RUNNING IT. ARSENE NEED AN INCREASED VOLUME THE MOST RECENT WEEK. MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED NINETY TWO THOUSAND MEALS ARE PROVIDED BY THE ACCOUNTING COMMUNITY. I AGENCY ON AGING SERVING OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THESE ARE BOTH PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY SERVING YOU MAY NEED MORE MEALS BECAUSE OF THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS. PEOPLE WHO USED TO GO TO COMMUNITY AND SENIOR CENTERS WHO NO LONGER I SHOULD DO NOT AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NEWLY IMPACTED ANNUALLY NEAT SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT A- PROPOSAL BASED ON THE THIS IS A PROPOSAL BASED ON THE ENORMOUS BUDGET PRESSURES WERE ALL FACING. AND THE THIRD QUESTION IS TO. TO ESTIMATE WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE OF THIS EIGHT A HALF MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION- BUT THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE USE IN THE REPORTING OF OUR NETWORK. THIS WOULD RESULT IN SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE FEWER MEALS- AND REACHED YOU ARE. A REDUCTION OF PEOPLE SERVED AT NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY OLDER ADULTS. I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR COMMON AND ANSWERS AS COMMENTS FROM LA- EXPRESS YOUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE- AS WAS NOTED IN THE HAND OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I'M CONSIST OF ONE ELIMINATIONS TO BENEFIT AND THEN TO REDUCTIONS TO STATE FUNDING LEVELS FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. IN THE CASE OF THE BENEFIT ELIMINATIONS FOR BOTH AND MRS PNC BASS I'M SIMILAR TO CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED IN THE HEALTH PORTION OF THE HEARING WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO ELIMINATE BENEFITS WITHIN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. IN LIGHT OF RECENT FEDERAL RULES AROUND STATE CONDITIONS- WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE TEMPORARY FEDERAL MATCH INCREASE ADDITIONALLY AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE M. S. S. P. ELIMINATION WELL THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES FULL YEAR SAVINGS WE WOULD NOTE THAT THAT IS ON- POSSIBLY UNLIKELY GIVEN THAT ONE WE WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL APPROVAL TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM BUT THAT ALSO THEY WERE PROBABLY. REQUIRE AND I HAVE A NEED FOR TIME TO FULLY TRANSITION RECIPIENTS OF THE PROGRAM AND RAMP DOWN OPERATIONS. ALTERNATIVES TO ELIMINATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS RATHER THAN ELIMINATING THE PROGRAMS ALL TOGETHER ASKING THE INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION IF THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE COVERAGE- REDUCE COST PRESSURES EITHER THROUGH WORKLOAD RELIEF OR PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES. AN EXAMPLE AND I MISSED AS HE IS THAT AS A PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET THERE WAS AN AUGMENTATION MADE TO INCREASE AND THIS IS P. PROVIDER RATES ACROSS THREE YEARS- AND ALTERNATIVE TO ELIMINATING THE PROGRAM ALTOGETHER COULD BE JUST. PULLING BACK THOSE UNSPENT FUNDS FROM- THE BUDGET YEAR AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR- WHICH WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT A TEN MILLION. DOLLAR ONE TIME SAVINGS. IN THE CASE FUNDING WERE DONE IT'S INTEREST. THAT THE ADMINS FOR SOME OF THE PRO AT LEAST EXPECT THAT THE WE'RE DONE. COULD BE. BY DISH ONE FEDERAL FUNDS THE STATE IS RECEIVING I'M DUE TO A CORONAVIRUS. I'M MEETING THAT TOTAL FUNDS WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS WOULD REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT. WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE STATE REDUCTIONS ARE PROPOSED TO BE ONGOING WHEREAS THE FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE ONE TIME AND ADDITIONALLY IT IS UNCLEAR TO US HOW QUICKLY THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT BY LOCAL PROGRAM PROVIDERS. I'M IN LIGHT OF THE POSSIBLE COLBY NINETEEN RESPONSE EFFORTS WHICH WOULD ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ON THIS- EXPECTATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS POTENTIALLY. OFFSETTING STAGE PRODUCTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CUT. SORRY OKAY. I JUST NOTING. ONLY A FEDERAL FUNDS SO. FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES SPECIFIC FUTURE SHE HAS PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE TWO. I'M OUR AGING I SERVICES WELL AS- FUNDS FOR. THE OMBUDSMAN GRAHAM AND DINO WORK THAT WE DO THAT THIS IS THE OR ISSUE EMPLOYMENT THESE WERE. ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FEDERAL FUNDS RECEIVED THANK YOU. HEY THANK YOU OUR FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER. SIR TOM L. IT YOU PRETTY MUCH MY QUESTION RICK B. EIGHTY ARE. I WAS GOING TO IF YOU KNOW THE ONE TIME FUNDED IT COULD OFFSET THE REDUCTIONS THERE- JUST WANT TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME WHEN W JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THE SERVICES ARE WHEN A TEEN SERVICES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS SO- ACTUALLY QUESTION FOR- BUT ITS AGING OR FINANCE SO. IS NOTED BY ELIO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS BUT- THESE CUTS ARE ON GOING WHY IS THAT THE CASE WHEN NOT JUST- MAC MATCH THE FEDERAL. THE HOPE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS AND HAVE IT IS A ONE YEAR. CONTRACT. FIND US AGAIN I THINK AND LOOKING AT THE BUDGET STRUCTURE WE ARE FACING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE OUT YEARS UP TO SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE REDUCTIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT CERTAIN SOME OF THESE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL TRIGGER SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT NECESSARY- JUST REITERATING THE POINT ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL. DEFICIT THIS BEFORE US. NO OPEN TO WORKING WITH LEGISLATURE THE COMING WEEK. OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF A FINE. TERMS OF THE HOPES FOR FUNDS WE TALKING FUTURE FEDERAL. OR WE LOOKING AT FUNDS THAT BEEN BY. TO OR HOPE TO CELSO WHICH WHICH FEDERAL FUNDS ARE WE A TWO BACK FILL THESE. TO SAY THE NUTRITION PRO OR A DISPLAY RESOURCE IT'S A- PERSPECTIVES FUN OKAY SO THE FUND WE RAISE. OUR DATA DATA BEEN PASSED CONGRESS THE THOSE WITH THOSE ALREADY CARRY. FOR HELP YOU HEAR ME. FINANCE ARE YOU HONEST YES OKAY. SOME STATE OR THE FEDERAL FUNDS SEPARATE BEEN ALLEN- TEMPORARY BAN PASSED BY CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT THOSE ARE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR SO WE'D HAVE TO. THESE ARE. IN TERMS OF THESE PARTICULAR YOU KNOW FUNNY THAT MIGHT HELP SUPPORT THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON THE VARIOUS PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENTS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF ALLOCATING THE DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE I BELIEVE FOR THE- FAMILIES FIRST. FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT ALLOWED TWENTY FIVE ALL PRICE TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE TRASH HEAP PROGRAM THOSE HAVE GONE OUT. HARPING ON WHERE THEY'RE OUT WITH. ME DOLLARS WERE. YEAH OKAY AGENCY DO YOU WANT THAT. YES THAT IS TRUE THANK YOU BEING IN IN YOU STILL WITH THAT OF IN. ACTED OUT TO AGENCIES AND JUNE OKAY BUT THAT THEY'RE FINE WITH NOW. THIS S MARK BACK AWAY FROM THE CALIFORNIA PART OF AGING ON THAT YOU'VE GOT THE DIRECTOR YEAH THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS- YOU KNOW ALL FEDERAL FUNDS SO EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION- IS MR HOUSER NOTED WERE RECEIVING AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION THROUGH THE FAMILY'S FIRST ACT AS WELL AS ANOTHER. FIFTY MILLION UNITS RESPONDING TO THE CURES ACT SO WE- ARE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS OKAY SO THAT WOULD THAT WOULD CONDEMN IS THAT MONEY CAN BE USED TO HELP MAKE UP FOR THE CUTS THAT. WE'RE PROPOSING HERE MAY REVISE. RADIO FOR. IT YEAH I MEAN IN THAT WOULD I MEAN WOULD SERVE SORT OF A OFFICER. I MEAN IT HAD WEAKENED WITH POINT FIVE MILLION. WE COULD OF. AS INTO THE- BUT- YEAH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING DOES HELP OFFSET. I'M THE POINT FIVE MILLION OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND THEN I THE. OTHER ISSUE DAY. AND A GUIDE RATE WE DISCUSS THAT EARLIER THIS BUT- HE OFFERS A AND THEN AND THAT'S P. I. OUT DC. I DON'T KNOW THERE'S ANY ESTIMATE FOR AGING. IN TERMS OF THE I. BECAUSE SO WE TAKE AWAY THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE HAVING PEOPLE. MAYBE NOT A HUNDRED AND IN A NURSING HOME BUT I HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ZERO AND UP TO THE NURSING. SO THESE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT HOME. AND ARE. SO WE ACCOUNT YEAH SO AGAIN. I DON'T THINK WE'RE COUNTING THAT OFFSET THE IN THE C. INTO OF THAT COST WILL OCCUR FROM ELIMINATING PROGRAM. BUT PERHAPS YOU SPEAK TO WHAT'S OF RESTARTING THESE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO SENSUALLY RICH ELIMINATE BOTH CBS AND MSSP. IF WE DO GET FEDERAL FUNDS WHAT KIND OF. EFFORT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IT TAKE ACTUALLY. THE PROGRAM AGAIN AS IT. GOING TO BE BETTER TO KEEP THEM. SINCE CAN'T REALLY CLOSE AND RIGHT AWAY UNLESS YOU REALLY PLAN TO TELL EVERYONE TO UNITE AND JULY FIRST WE JUST. EVERYONE BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'D ACTUALLY DO OR MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT. IS THAT. WOULD MAKE MENTION OF THAT SO MAYBE AGING CAN ADDRESS THAT I MEAN. IF EVEN IF THIS WAS PASSED. ARE WE JUST. GONNA DO JULY FIRST. YES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND OUR LOCAL PROVIDER NETWORKS OF BOTH A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND MULTI PURPOSE ADULT SERVICES ABOUT- WHAT A TIME LINE WOULD BE AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IT WOULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS BOTH FROM A- REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL PARTNER CMS YOU GET APPROVAL BUT ALSO FROM A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE HAVING TRANSITION PLANS FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE BEING SERVED- AND THE CENTRIST THEMSELVES. IN OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST TIME THE SHUT DOWN I WOULD. A DIRECTOR COURSE OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS WHO CAN WHO CAN POWERFULLY TELL THE STORY OF THAT HISTORY BUT ALSO THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING A SUBCOMMITTEE ON LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. I DID DO A REPORT. THE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING STRENGTHENING THESE NETWORKS AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY CITE IS THAT- IT HAS TAKEN ABOUT A DECADE TO REBUILD. ON THE NETWORK SO THESE ARE AGAIN- EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS AND- TRADE OFFS AND I BELIEVE OUR FINANCE COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER THOSE. OTHER COSTS YOU MENTION THIS MORNING AGAIN RACE HERE ARE ARE IN THE ESTIMATE. OKAY FRAN. YES CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE AT THE ACS AND JC COOPER OTHER COSTS FOR- ALSO. ARE NOT BUILT TEN NOW WE DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER WOULD BE AN IT'S IN THE BUDGET OR CURRENTLY. NOTHING OR PERCENT OKAY WELL I WOULD SO SOUNDS LIKE WE MORE I READING OF WHAT THE TWO SAVINGS WE BE IF WE TOOK SO A POLICY SET UP WITH I NOT SURE A GOOD I BUT MORE ACT. WE NEED TO BE IN THE TRANSIT TIME WHERE WE HAVE CONTINUED FUNDING WE NEED TO BUILD IN THE OFFSET. OF THE COSTS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY REALLY TRULY END UP IN TERMS OF SAVINGS IT MAY TURN OUT THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WORTH THE EFFORT. TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM FROM A BUT EVEN FROM A SIMPLY BUDGETARY POINT OF VIEW I THINK MY POLICY POINT OF VIEW THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO SAY WHY THIS WOULD BE A BAD IDEA BUT EVEN FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT WE NEED TO HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING. OF. WHAT WE SHOULD DO WE COULD REALLY EXPECT. SO OKAY ANY OTHER. OR ON A- OKAY WELL. FOR MUCH LET'S NOW. O TO THE APARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND AGAIN ASKED THAT- FOCUS THE PRESENTATION ON THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA. THANK YOU THANKS THANK YOU SENATOR AND THIS IS NANCY BARTON DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THANK YOU COULD SEE YOU THANK YOU SO DOCTRINE- YOUR ATTENTION TO. THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA IF YOU WANTED TO- SO START ON A PAGE SIX- THIS- CORRECTLY NOTES IN THE QUESTION AND THE SUMMARY OF THE QUESTION IS THAT- WE HAD IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. A PROVIDER RATE INCREASE OF EIGHT POINT 2% FOR CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS- AND AT THAT TIME WE HAD- REQUESTED AND HAD APPROVED A SUSPENSION OF THOSE RATE INCREASES- DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR PROPOSED TO EXTEND THAT EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SUSPENSIONTO BE EXTENDED OUT TO JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE- MAY REVISE CONTINUES WITH THAT PROPOSAL. ON THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS ASKING ABOUT HOW THEY EAT THE RATE INCREASE AND TWENTY NINETEEN WOULD BE EFFECTIVE RAISING THEIR RATES CUT TWICE SO QUESTIONING AT THAT EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT. IF WHAT WERE ABLE TO DO AND THE PROJECTION. OF THE PROPOSED. REDUCTION THAT WERE GOING TO BE COUNTING REDUCE. MORE ONCE SO TO ANSWER THE I'M GONNA GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE AT ALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THAT. READ THAT WE PROPOSED A BEFORE I THAT AND TO JUST MAKE A CAR. POINT SO ON THESE HOLE ON SEO IT TALKS ABOUT WENT DOT APPROACH. RATE AND READ OF THE- TREND. FOR A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL STATEMENTS AND THAT IS ACCURATE- JUST TO CLARIFY THAT ACTUALLY IT'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THE- GENERAL FUND SAVINGS THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED FOR THE PAYMENT REDUCTION. AND THEN SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS THAT ARE RELATED TO- EXPENDITURE REVIEWS AND- UTILIZATION REVIEWS AND STANDARDIZING SERVICE AS- AND SO ON ME DAY THAT THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK IN IDENTIFYING THE STATUS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. WE'VE IDENTIFIED THREE DIFFERENT TIER LEVELS IT WAS INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY THAT WAS UPDATED AND RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND BASED ON THAT WE IDENTIFIED THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF INCREASES. THEREFORE GIVEN AN INDICATION OF THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT THEIR CURRENT RATE IS AND THEN HOW MUCH THEY WOULD BE NEEDING TO- HAD IS AN INCREASE THOSE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF INCREASE FOR THOSE THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING THAT- THE GREATEST RELEASE- ON A PAYMENT REDUCTION. AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD BE THE PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING A SEVEN POINT. FIVE PERCENT- PAYMENT REDUCTION AND- GROUPS WE HAVE OUR LIVES IT JUST TURNED OFF SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE ELEVEN POINT 5% WAS- FOR THOSE IN THE MID RANGE AND THEN FOR THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS- THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS EITHER RESEEDING- HELLO UP FIVE PERCENT. INCREASE AT THE UPDATED RATE STUDY REFLECTED OR ACTUALLY HAD A DECREASE THEY WERE- GOING. TO BE RECEIVING A GREATER LEVEL I THAT YEAR FORT PER AND CLARIFY. THE EIGHT POINT TWO PER WHAT WE DID IS THAT WE HAVE A POINT TO PROVE. PAYMENTS INK THE IS IN OUR BASE. AND SO THE BASE RATES THE HAVE THE PAYMENT READ. ON TOP FOR IT IS NOT EIGHT. THAT WE I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD PROPOSED THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICE CODES TO BE INCLUDED. I'M IN A SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASED TWO OF THEM WERE WITH AN EARLY START WHEN WAS WITH. INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS AND WE HAVE WITHDRAWN THAT PROPOSAL FROM THE AND IN THE MAY REVISE- I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE. IN OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO MODIFY THOSE. THREE DIFFERENT SERVICE CODES TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT- AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE EIGHT EIGHT. RELATED REDUCTION AND THEREFORE THERE ARE- PAYMENT REDUCTION WOULD BE- FACTORING THAT EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT- I'M GOING TO THE QUESTION ON AND ON IT THE- THE SOURCE OF THE ESTIMATE FOR. THE REVIEW OF THE EXPENDITURE TRENDS- I WANT TO ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE EXPENDITURE TRENDS AND ALSO UTILIZATION REVIEW AS A PART OF THAT SEVENTY MILLION THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING- WE DO HAVE PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER THE LANGUAGE FOR JULY FIRSTTWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO START IDENTIFYING SAVINGS THIS YEAR- AS I NOTED THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO BE TARGETING- THAT SEVENTY MILLION AND IDENTIFIED SAVINGS. THE FIRST A STANDARDIZATION OF TARGETED SERVICES SO WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR TRENDS FOR SERVICES. THAT ARE ACROSS THE STATE FAMILIES HAVE HAD SOME GOOD. ABOUT INCONSISTENCIES RACIAL CENTERS AND DIFFERENT POLICIES AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR RESPITE WE BELIEVE BY TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE INSTEAD. SPITZER AS MY TO. THAT THAT WOULD BE A TO AFFECT SOME SAVING. BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO SOME TRY. AND CLEAR INTO SERVICE. OF THOSE SIR. THE OTHER ONE IS TAKE A LOOK AT A FISH SEES WE DO KNOW THAT FROM THE RISK. WHEN WE HAD OTHER SAVING MEASURES AT THEIR WORST GROUP THAT WENT FORWARD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME SAVINGS. WE BELIEVE IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE THAT- ALLOW FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME SAVINGS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE THE TABOR DAY SERVICE SAYS. THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN HAVE A PERSON CENTERED APPROACH TO THEIR DAY- AND SO IT CAN BE- BASED ON IF THEY'RE RECEIVING- SIX HOURS A DAY OF SERVICE DURING THE WEEK THEY MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A MUCH. REDUCED NUMBER OF HOURS SERVICE BUT THE FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO. A DRIVE THEIR DATA TO HOW THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR SERVICE. WOULD ABOUT TO THE- THIS IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BECAUSE A COUPLE AS WERE HOW TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE KHAN. SETTINGS AND REDUCING THE EXPOSURE OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS- LIKELY GOING TO BE AN OPTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXPLORE NOT ONLY FOR COST SAVING MEASURES BUT ALSO FOR THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS. AS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE- LARGER CONGREGATE SETTINGS. THE FINAL ONE IS ON UTILIZATION. FOR INDIVIDUALS- FOR UTILIZATION AND SERVICE UTILIZATION WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF OUR AVERAGE COST PER CONSUMER WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE BY TAKING A LOOK AT. THE UTILIZATION PARTICULAR FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR HIGHEST COST. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE ACTUALLY STARTED SCENE AND- A COUPLE OF INDIVIDUALS AND QUITE A FEW THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN EXPENDITURES AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT NOT TO REMOVE THE SAFETY. NOT TO REMOVE THE SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY BUT BUILDING AND- A REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS IF THE SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED ON GOING THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK. AND TO VERIFY THAT THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. I'M WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE PLANS WE DO HAVE EXPENDITURE TRENDS THAT WE WANT SOME- TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE WE MOVE FORWARD THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE IDENTIFYING. IS THAT WHAT ARE THOSE EXPENDITURE TRENDS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF. THINGS THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED BASED ON POLICY OR THINGS THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED BASED ON CASE LAW CHANGES- WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOVING FROM SCHOOL AGE TO EDUCATION. THAT OFTEN TRY AND STRIPES ARE ARE TRENDS IN OUR CHANGES AND EXPENDITURES. BUT IF WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THINGS- BASED ON THOSE EXPENDITURES BY REGIONAL CENTERS THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED. THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GONNA WANT TO FOCUS THE REGIONAL CENTERS- PLANS AND IDENTIFYING EXPLAINING THAT AND THEN- BUILDING A PLAN TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE. ANYTHING THAT IS NOT. NECESSARY OUTSIDE OF POLICY. AND NEEDS OF END OF CERTAINLY. THE CONCERN AS WE MOVE OPERATE. WITH A PROPOSED FOR THE RE. OF OPERATE. FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS OUR PROPOSAL AS A REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUND OF FORTY MILLION- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEART AND THE THAT THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE DO. FIRST SERVING INDIVIDUALS IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND A VERY LARGE SHERRIN PORTION OTHER REGIONAL CENTER BUDGET. IS WITH THE SERVICE COORDINATION- WE DO KNOW HOWEVER THAT. IN TAKING A LOOK AT THIS CURRENT YEAR- FOR ME REVISED. WE HAVE PROPOSED FOR BUDGET YEAR- THE GROWTH OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. THAT WE ANTICIPATE GROWING ABOVE OUR CURRENT- CASELOAD- AND WE DO HAVE PROPOSED IN THE-MAY REVISED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT CASE ON GROWTH. WE ALSO HAVE- PROPOSED TO SUPPORT THE EXPENDITURE GROWTH THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT- AGAIN NOT MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF A REDUCTION OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IT DOES REPRESENT BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE PERCENT. OF THE REGIONAL CENTER CASE. REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS DOLLARS- CERTAINLY MEANINGFUL BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE BASED ON THAT AND BASED ON THE OTHER SUPPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO- THE REGIONAL CENTER BUDGET THIS NEXT YEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT REDUCING SERVICE COORDINATORS. THIS WILL TAKE SOME- HARD WORK BY REGIONAL CENTERS IN LOOKING AT THEIR EXPENDITURES IDENTIFYING WAYS- TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS. ALONG WITH AN EXPENDITURE PLAN WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING REGIONAL CENTERS TO SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT AN OPERATIONS PLAN THAT'S GOING TO BE IDENTIFYING. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACHIEVING THOSE SAVINGS BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO MONITOR. HOW WE'RE DELIVERING SERVICES TO THE INDIVIDUALS I'M CONSIDERING ALL OF THE OTHER ACTIONS THAT ARE HAVING TO BEAT- IMPLEMENTED ON TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ECONOMIC. THE. PUBLIC PRICE. SO IN ADDITION TO OF THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORKING WITH OUR DS FORCE AND I DON'T. WHAT ARE THE MAIN AND A- THAT WE NEED TO. IT FOR HAVE REST FOR END OF. SO WE START MY- SOME OF THOSE FOR EARLY ON. A WE'RE EXPLORING THINGS SUCH AS SURVEYS FAMILY WORKING TO BE I'M GOING TO. OUR CONTRACT WITH REGIONAL. WE'RE CONTINUE OUR DASH AND I. INDICATE AND MAKING THAT. THE THINGS THAT WE ARE OUR MONITOR TO INCLUDE COMPLAINTS AND WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS UP FORTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE WHICH ARE THE- COMPLAINTS THAT FAMILIES CAN- SUBMIT OR- DENY ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA WANT TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT THOSE- ACTIVITIES TO SEE A PRISTINE INCREASES. AND BE ABLE TO WORK ON IT LASTLY I WILL NOTE THAT WE HAD- PRETTY MUCH IMPLEMENTED OUR RESTRUCTURE WITH ADDITIONAL LAYERS ON THAT ARE OUT WORKING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS- AND THAT WILL BE REALLY BENEFICIAL TO REALLY TRACK IN HERE WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE. BY ATTENDING BOARD MEETINGS OF REGIONAL CENTERS BY ATTENDING. DIFFERENT MEETINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY TO SEE WHAT IS IMPACTING THOSE- THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. LASTLY I'VE BEEN OUT. TO RESPOND THE- CONCERNED REGARDING THE PER. TO MY- OUR FEDERAL PARTICIPATION AND SERVICE JOBS TO MAKE KERR. AND THAT WAY IS TWO AND- INDIVIDUAL ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND. SO IT'S NOT INCOME ELIGIBLE BUT ON GETTING THEM ON MEDIC HOW BASED ON INTEREST INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND AT THAT POINT. WE DO HAVE ABOUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT- REALLY MAY QUALIFY WE RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL OF THEM WELL- WE ALSO HEARD FROM ADVOCATES THAT MUCH OF THE CONCERN AS THE COMPLEXITIES OF COMPLETING THAT AND NOT WANTING TO HAVE. A UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF PEOPLE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES IF THEY DON'T COMPLETE THAT APPLICATION. WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL DOLLARS PRICKLY AT THIS TIME. SO WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH OUR ADVOCATES WE'VE ALREADY STARTED A SMALL WORKGROUP. IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THE PROCESS OF THE APPLICATION AND WE CAN REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS- TWO THINGS ON THAT ONE IS THAT IF WE CAN DO TRAINING WAS SERVICE COORDINATORS MAYBE TRAINING WAS STATE COUNCIL REGIONAL OFFICES- LOOKING AT OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE CAN HAVE OUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT FAMILIES. BUT ALSO THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS NOT A DUE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO HELP FOR FAMILIES IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THOSE ARE ACTUALLY AS WE HAVE BROAD AUTHORITY WE HAVE BROAD LANGUAGE IN OUR STATUTE. FOR THE FAMILIES THAT CAN END CONSUMERS CAN APPEAL- ANY DECISION BY THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THIS WOULD FALL UNDER THAT STATUTE. I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THESE ISSUES. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- COMES FROM. HELLO HEY. PIANO THEN OTHER SENATE SOON YOU PAY FROM THE- ANALYST'S I JUST HAVE MAIN. TO MAKE A THE DUTY THROUGH BUT FOR. THAT WAS. I'M THE FIRST IS THAT IT'LL BE REALLY. TO KEEP AN EYE ON. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF ALL OF THE VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED ON THE INDIVIDUALS SEARCH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SH SO FOR EXAMPLE- THERE ARE PROPOSALS TO REDUCE. PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS FIND EFFICIENCIES IN FORCE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE ALL OF THESE TARGET THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS TO FIND SAVINGS. AT THE SAME TIME THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO MAINTAIN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATES THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY. AND TO INCREASE FUNDING- RELATED TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND REGIONAL CENTERS DURING THE PANDEMIC WILL BE ENDING IN JUNE SH AND THERE HASN'T BEEN. A LOT OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN TERMS OF THE TRANSITION TO RE OPENING- ONCE. ONCE IT'S DEEMED SAFE. FOR PROVIDERS TO DO SO. IT'LL ALSO IMPORT TO LOOK AT OTHER AREAS OF THIS BUT THE WILL AFFECT. CONSUMER SO DOES TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLE DDS. RELY ON IN SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS A GENERIC RESOURCE THEY MUST EXHAUST THIS A GENERIC RESOURCE BEFORE ACCESSING SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES. IF THE- IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE PROPOSED REDUCTION TO IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES HOURS THEN WE WILL LIKELY SEE AN INCREASE IN THE DDS BUDGET- AS THOSE CONSUMERS ACCESS MORE HOURS IN SUPPORTED. LIVING SERVICES AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THOSE- SORTS OF IMPACTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE STATE BUDGET. OUR SECOND POINT IS THAT WE RECKON THE VILLAGES AND ADMINISTRATION- RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE AND ENSURE CONTINUED SERVICES THAT ARE REALLY NEEDED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE SH- SO FOR EXAMPLE- IF IT WILL BE GOOD TO GET MORE CLARITY INTO THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND TO KNOW WHAT ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. IN THAT RESPONSE AND JUST TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. EVEN IF IT COULD TAKE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AS AN EXAMPLE EVEN IF IT MAKES SENSE FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. TO ENFORCE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IT'S UNCLEAR TO US THAT REQUIRING THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS TO BE THE SAME FOURTEEN DAYS ACROSS CONSUMERS AND ACROSS- SERVICES IN ACROSS THE STATE- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE IT MIGHT WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES IF- IF PROVIDERS ARE TRYING TO STAY UNDER SERVICES ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND DIFFERENT HOURS AND THAT SORT OF THING. OKAY THE THIRD POINT I'D LIKE TO MEET IT'S ABOUT THE ROLE OF REGIONAL CENTERS HE- REVISED BUDGET PROPOSAL. BECAUSE A SINGLE TINA REDUCE FUNDING REGIONAL. WHILE INCREASING THEIR WORKLOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A UTILIZATION REVIEW. DEVELOP AN EXPENDITURE PLAN- DIRECTOR MARGARINE JUST MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AN OPERATIONS PLAN. AND THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO HELP FAMILIES ENROLL IN MEDICARE SO- IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS MAY BE REVISED SLIGHTLY- TO TARGET CONSUMER OUTCOMES- IN THERE WILL BE A TEN MINUTE- IT MINISTRATION ASSOCIATED WITH. ENFORCING THE FAMILY THE NEW FAMILY FEE STRUCTURE- SO THE DEPARTMENT HAS INCLUDED A COUPLE OF FLEXIBILITY IS TO- SORT OF- THAT. IS SOME OF THE WORKLOAD I GUESS YOU'D SAY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ONE IS TO REMOVE A CASELOAD. RATIO REQUIREMENT THAT'S CURRENTLY IN STATUTE FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN THE MEDICAID WAIVER. AND WHO ARE NOT REALLY START CONSUMERS ANOTHER IS TO- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING REMOTE SERVICE COORDINATION OR OR TELE SERVICE COORDINATION- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE- PROPOSAL TO REMOVE THE CASELOAD RATIO REQUIREMENT. AND ALTHOUGH WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT CASELOAD THIS IS WHAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO. ENSURE QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVISION THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THAT REMOVING THIS RATIO WOULD ALLOW REGIONAL CENTERS TO APPROACH SERVICE COORDINATION MORE AND MORE INNOVATIVE FASHION. OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITH THIS- SIMULTANEOUS REDUCTION OF FUNDING THAT IT'LL SIMPLY RESULT IN HIGHER CASELOADS AND. NOT INNOVATIVE APPROACHES. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THE MAYOR OF. INCLUDE A LOT OF THE STORY TO THE- IN TERMS OF. THE ACT DETAILS ASSOC WITH FINDING THE EFFICIENT. IN THE BUDGET I. AS WELL AS IN THE OF G. THAT WILL BE MADE REGIONAL CENTER. TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS A LOT OF THOSE DETAILS ARE TO BE DETERMINED. SO WE HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF- RECOMMENDATIONS- ONE IS THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER ACTIONS WE RECOMMEND THAT IT ADOPT BUDGET LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT. TO REPORT BY MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON HOW THOSE ACTIONS HAVE IMPACTED- CONSUMERS ACCESS TO SERVICES. AND IT SOUNDS. I GLAD TO HEAR THE JUST DIRECTOR BY MAY THIS THAT THEY BE WORKING WITH THE D. S. TASK. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS DURING THIS PERIOD SO THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DATA ON THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS IN EACH CATEGORY WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE. THAT CONSUMERS ARE STILL GETTING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- WE ALSO RECOMMEND SHOULD REQUIRING THE ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE- ONCE DDS IS MADE SOME OF THE KEY DECISIONS THAT ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED SUCH AS- HOW EFFICIENCIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE BUDGET. AS WELL AS THEIR SPECIFIC- CHANGES THAT WILL BE MADE TO REGIONAL CENTRES OPERATING- BUDGETS MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN- FINALLY I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THE PROPOSAL TO IN TRYING TO ENROLL MORE FAMILIES IN A MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM SAYS THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FINANCE. YOUR BROWSER. FINANCE LIKE A- COUPLE OF POINTS BASED ON RECORD. SINCE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. BUT FIRST. SINCE THE PAYMENT REDUCTION. ALL THE TOTALS THREE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL. DEPARTMENT PROVIDE. A PLAN FOR CHEATING SAVINGS AND TWENTY TWO ONE BUT FULLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ENGAGE. AND FUTURE SHOW THE. ON THE SITUATION AND THEN MAKING THE CONSEQUENCES ASKS SO IT WANTED TO PARTNER PROVIDES A- AND BUDGET YEAR ALWAYS OPEN TO ENGAGE STAKE TO IDENTIFY IT OR IS ABOUT STRATEGY AND A FEW YEARS ON THE NEXT I WILL ITS THE DEPARTMENT DOES. SWITCHING THE SAVINGS AT THE END. YOU THE RESULTS ARE. WORK OR CONSUMER. AND THE LAST POINT I. UNDER THAT I ND DIFFICULT SEARCH OF TO REDUCE RESULTS OUR OPERATIONS THAT. POSIBLES WE TO INITIATE THAT PATIENTS THESE PERHAPS MAYBE NOT IN THE MEDIA SHORTS BUT IN THE LONG TERM SUCH. THE RESTRUCTURE OF THE COSHAM THAT. THE OUR MAN HEADQUARTERS WILL COLLECT SOME OF THOSE HE SO I DO THINK THAT THERE SOME EFFICIENCIES BE GAINED KNOWLEDGE OF THE YES WORK WITH X. REVIEWS YOUR. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU A QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SAY NO QUESTIONS FOR CREAM. EIGHT THE PRESIDENT. I GUESS. HELLO BUT I GUESS ANOTHER I KNOW OF WE HAVE A WEIRD WITH SOME BY ISSUE WE WERE FOR SOME I WOULD MAKE NOTE SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IS THAT WELL CERTAINLY- REDUCTION IN RESOURCES MAY STIMULATE SOME CREATIVE THINKING OFTENTIMES CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR ACTUALLY REQUIRES INVESTMENT MORE RESOURCES. AND I THINK WE SEEN THIS ON REPEATED OCCASIONS WHERE SOMEONE SAID WELL IF WE ONLY DID THIS WE COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE BUT ACTUALLY WHAT THEY DID INVEST IN ACTUALLY MAKING THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE SO I JUST PUT THAT CAUTION OUT THERE THAT- CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S GOOD TO ENGAGE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THINKING MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT WAYS THEY CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT SIMPLY TAKING THE MONEY AWAY UP FRONT. MAY ACTUALLY DENIED THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE THE KIND. OF CHANGES THAT THE- CENTER MAY MAKE THAT LEAD TO SAY AS A SO THERE MAY BE THOUGHT OF. HAVING SOME TO BE A TO MAKE AN- WHEN THERE'S A CLEAR DIRECTION AS TO WHAT MAY BE. A CHANGE THAT COULD LEAD TO A GREATER EFFICIENCIES IN THE FUTURE CERTAINLY SOMETHING WEWANT TO TRY TO PUSH FOR- I SEE THE- TERMS OF. THE PARTS OR SERVICES YET DELEO HAD SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN WE ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME BUDGETARY ISSUES- THE- FOR EXAMPLE THAT ANY WEEDS. NOT NOT A BIG FAN OF THE FOURTEEN. DAY HOLIDAY FEES BUT. AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT I. GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OF SAMPLE FOR. WE IT MADE IT MADE BE HIGHER TO BUILD IMPLEMENTED FEES IT HAD TO BE. FOURTEENTH DAYS AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE TO DO A SOCIAL DISTANCING OUR- PHYSICAL DISTANCING OR SOME OTHER. SCHEDULED ARRANGEMENT TO TRY TO MINIMIZE- EITHER EXPOSURE OR TREATING THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENTS OPEN TO. HELLO. OKAY I SEE DIRECTOR PARCHMENT ON THERE OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY NOW SAID OKAY I CAN HEAR YOU NOW YES YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT LITTLE TECHNICAL ISSUE- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF THINGS AND RECOGNIZE THAT- THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN A PROCESS THAT WAS USED IN THE PAST AND UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS- WE'RE STILL SEEING IT AS A COST SAVING MEASURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT- WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ONE OF THE AREAS FOR- THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THAT WE CHANGED OUR PROPOSING AS A DIFFERENCE THAN WE HAD IN THE PRIOR IMPLEMENTATION- WAS WITH EMPLOYMENT WE ASK THAT- WE WOULD EXCLUDE THOSE WHO AREN'T COMPETITIVELY IN. INTEGRATED EMPLOYED BECAUSE RECOGNIZING AND THIS WAS- BASED ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT THOSE WHO HAVE JOBS YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAD JOBS ON SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND THERE'S JUST DIFFERENT TIMES SO WE WERE EXCLUDED THAT TRYING TO DO SOME POSSIBILITY INTO THE APPROACH THIS TIME- SOME OF THE COST SAVING MEASURES HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE IN ALIGNMENT AND THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE SO IF YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ATTENDING A PROGRAM AND THEN THERE'S RELATED COSTS THAT- COME ALONG WITH THAT- BUT WE DO- HERE AND ARE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW IT IS- EVERYTHING ALIGNED WITH. CONSIDERATION OUR APPROACH TO- RESPONSE TO KOBE. OKAY WELL ANYTHING A TO SHOW. AS WELL LINE MAKES SOME SAY PUBLIC MAY DEMAND THAT THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS SO. AND BY THE THAT MY REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT THAT MAY BE DRIVING COSTS UP EVEN YOU KNOW. THIS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN. MYSTERY MOST. LINEUPS BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THOUGH THAT- THE FOURTEEN DAY HOLIDAY SCHEDULE YOU KNOW IS IN SOME WAYS AS I THINK THE ADVOCATES WOULD POINT OUT IS A SORT OF A FURLOUGH OF SORTS BECAUSE THE NEED FOR THE SERVICES DON'T. SUDDENLY STOP ON THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I IT'S ONLY PRETTY SURE YOUR EXPLANATION BUT I. THINK IN. TERMS OF THE- HELP THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE SUSPENSION. MMHM YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING CUTS NOW- WE SHOULD PRAY ELIMINATE THE FUTURE SUSPENSION AND IF WE HAVE TO MAKE CUTS IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD DELIBERATE ABOUT THAT SORT OF MAKE THEM AUTOMATIC. AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONSIDER THAT THAT'S WERE READY MAKING CUTS UP FRONT- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMEY ASSEMBLE AND THIS YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I JUST. OUR WE HAD WE RUNNERS ON IN A C. NOW WHERE SOME OF THE AUTHORITY THERE WE- WOULD BE EXTRA. RIGHT WAS WITH PERSON SO I JUST WOULD LIKE FOR SOMEONE TO ADDRESS WHAT I SEE IN HERE WHICH IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CUTS ON WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AND MIGHT NOT. I UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTLY AND IF AND IF THAT IS THE CASE I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO YOU KNOW HOW WHAT DROVE THE LEGISLATURE'S GOING TO PAY TO PLAY. IN ANY ADDITIONAL CUTS IF ANY. THANK YOU CENTER THIS IS NANCY PARCHMENT DIRECTOR DDS- I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A PART OF THE THREE HUNDRED. MILLION PROJECTED GENERAL FUND- AND THAT SEVENTY MILLION IS WITH THE UTILIZATION STANDARDIZATION AND EXPENDITURES. THE PROPOSAL. FORMER REALLY WITH THE INTENT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND IDENTIFYING THAT. SO YOU KNOW IN ABSENCE OF THE SEVENTY MILLION WORKING ON THE ABILITY TO STANDARDIZE SERVICES AND LOOKING AT THE EXPENDITURE AND UTILIZATION SAVINGS- HAVING OUR OUR COMMUNITY WAY N. ON THOSE PRIORITIES- WAS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO YOU KNOW REPORT BACK THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRANSPARENT. AND CONVERSATIONS AND ALSO WITH- HOW THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED- SHORT OF NOT NINETEEN SEVENTY MILLION IN THESE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES- AND LOOKING AT COST SAVING MEASURES- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HAVING THAT AS A DIGEST ALL- PROVIDER PAYMENT REDUCTIONS. ON THOSE THAT WAY JUST SAY LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE AND BUDGET YEAR AS WERE AS- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAD IDENTIFIED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING UP A PRETTY. ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO TALK ABOUT- THE OUT YEARS- AND SO IN IN WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STILL- DID THAT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THAT WE WANT TO DO THAT AND MEDIATE LADY WITH- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING A BUDGET YEAR. OKAY WELL LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY- CERTAINLY I THINK THAT- RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR AN OVERALL REDUCTION HI SHE TEN STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL BUT I THINK IN THE END. OBVIOUSLY FOR OUT YEARS WE WILL BE HAVING HEARINGS FOR THE OUT YEARS SO WE WILL CERTAINLY BE WEIGHING IN. BUT ALSO PERHAPS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT AND- PERHAPS ELLIE THERE'S SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS TOO. IN TERMS OF FITTING IN THE CONTROLS IN PLACE SO THAT THE THERE'S LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OVER. MORE SPECIFIC CUTS I NEED A QUICK CERTAINLY WELCOME STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS AND DIDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT ALSO I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN AND SOME OF THE FINAL. DECISIONS ABOUT PAYMENT RATES. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE. ON OKAY JUST WOUND ONE FINAL COMMENT ON. BEFORE WE MOVE ON THE ISSUE TOO. IS THAT I DO WANT TO TAKE DOWN THE HAULAGE AND RECOGNIZE THAT- YES WE HAVE A BUDGET ISSUE BUT WE ALSO DID THIS. RATE STUDY WHICH WE- YOU KNOW WHICH FOR MANY YEARS WE SAID WE TOOK A RATE STUDY WE TOLERATE SAY NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT STUDY THE RATE STUDY SHOWED THAT EVEN PRIOR. TO THESE PROPOSED CUTS. WE HAD WE OVER TREMENDOUSLY UNDERFUNDING DD SERVICES SO- I'D RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN ELECTED WHEN WE HAD A BUDGET DEFICIT- IN BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING BUT RECOGNIZING WE ARE. TAKING AN UNDERFUNDED SYSTEM AND CUTTING IT EVEN MORE. AND SO WELL WANT TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TURN THAT AROUND AND- AND AGAIN KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DO HAVE THIS RATE STUDY- THAT WAS ACTUALLY PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT THERE THE CONSOLE THEY SELECTED THAT SHOWED US THAT. THERE WAS. THAT THIRD THAT THE PROGRAM IS OVERLY. OVERALL AND FUN UNDERFUNDED. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE INCUMBENTS. STAND TRIAL CAPACITY. THANK HI THIS IS. BARR TWENTY. I DIRECTOR DD. AND I HAVE ALSO ME ACTING DEPUTY. NORM CREAM. RATE THIS DATA. SHE THERE BE AN FOLLOW UP. THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN IN TO COVER YOU TODAY THE PORTABLE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO AN OLD. DEFINITELY GET RIGHT TO THE THREE QUESTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED BEFORE US TODAY- IT IS OVER AT PORTER BILL- IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED. WITH A FELONY FELONY AND ARE COURT ORDERED TO PORTER VILLE. DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. UNDER THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND REQUIRING COMPETENCY TRAINING SO THERE'S REALLY TWO AND I'M TOO TIRED A COURT COMMITMENT INTO PORTABLE SECURE TREATMENT. ONE IS A THIRTEEN SEVENTY POINT ONE WHICH ARE THE INDIVIDUALS I JUST DESCRIBED. THAT ARE CHARGED WITH A FELONY AND THAT- COMPETENCY TRAINING. DETERMINATION NEEDS TO BE MADE- ONE THIRD THIRD TRAINING OCCURS AND SOMEBODY IS DETERMINED COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THEN THEY CAN- THEY WOULD THEN RETURN TO JAIL AND- GO AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD AND- THAT YOU JUST PROCESS- IF THEY'RE DETERMINED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THERE. THEIR COURT COMMITMENT IS CHANGED AT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED. AND THEN THERE- AT PORTER BILL AND THEN WE CAN START WORKING ON TRANSITIONS TO THE COMMUNITY- BUT- THE- AGENDA IT CORRECTLY NOTES THAT HARD WORK THAT CERTAINLY THAT APARTMENT A COMMITTEE IS DONE IN REDUCING RELIANCE ON INTEREST. INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. AND THIS KIND OF GOES COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IN REDUCING. OUR STATE OPERATED FACILITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS- I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY PROPOSAL. FOR SO AT TEN FLARE THAT I WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. AND REDUCING THOSE JUST OKAY CAN PASS. AND GET R. R. OUR OCCUPANCY BACK DOWN TO TWO ELEVEN. AND I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THOSE YOU'RE QUITE THAT YOU PROPOSED. SO WHEN I DO. THE TREAT OPTIONS BEING. AND COMMUNITY THANK PLACE PLAN WHICH WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MILLION. OF FOR START AT EVERY YEAR TO DEVELOP. AND COMMUNITY RESOURCE. MUCH OF THAT. THAT BEEN FOCUSED ONLY ON THE CLOTHES OF FAIRVIEW PART OF THE- GENERAL TREATMENT AND SO NOW MUCH ABOUT CENTER OVER THE LAST NUMBER IF. WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM OVER AT PORTER BELLE. WE HAVE PART OF OUR SAFETY NET PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD PROPOSED OR STEP DOWN HOMES. DISTURBANCE OF VISUALS MOVING FROM THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY- THOSE FOUR HOMES ARE IN VARYING DEGREES OF DEVELOPMENT IF THERE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE UP TO TWENTY INDIVIDUALS. MOVING OUT OF THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM- ONE OF THE HOMES IS READY TO GO AND IT JUST FINALIZING THE LEASE AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT SIDE OF THE OPERATIONS OF THAT HOME. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT IS PROJECTED TO OPEN AND BE READY TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN WE HAD TWO ADDITIONAL HOMES THAT ARE. JUST SHORTLY BEHIND THAT IT WILL BE READY TO SUPPORT THOSE TRANSITIONS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE ANOTHER- FOUR DIFFERENT HOMES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO START TRANSITION OF INDIVIDUALS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT A STEP DOWN HOME BUT MORE OF A FOREVER HOME. AND THOSE AGAIN ARE OVER THE NEXT TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN READINESS- WE ALSO HAVE PROPOSED AND- THAT BUDGET IS A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ENHANCED VEHICLE SUPPORTS HOMES TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BEFORE US IS THAT HOW WE ESTABLISH ANY COMMUNITY RESOURCES. TO HELP WITH- COMPETENCY TRAINING- THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE PROPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT. THE USE OF C. DOLL TO. IT REESE. FOR COMPANIES. TRAINING THEY CAN AND WE BEEN ABLE TO. APPROVE THOSE WE HAVE TO PROJECTS THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED. TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY TRAIN THEN THEY CAN. ADDITIONALLY WE DO HAVE. A NUMBER OF HOME THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME. IN THERE DID COMING UP THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR INDIVIDUALS- WHO- WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE COMPETENCY TRAINING IN THE COMMUNITY. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE IDENTIFIED IS DOING ADDITIONAL TRAINING OUTSIDE. OF COMPETENCY TRAINING DOING FRIENDS THAT CONFERENCES DOING SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO BUILD UP. THEIR EXPERTISE WITHIN EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COURT. ON ALTERNATIVE SERVICES AS OPPOSED TO HAVING INDIVIDUALS GO TO PORTABLE SECURE TREATMENT. BUT AND IN TURN TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY- INDICATES THE AGENDA IT NOTED THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BUILD FOR CAPACITY OF FIFTY INDIVIDUALS I'LL JUST MAKE NOTE. THAT IS FOR- ACTUALLY THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP A MAXIMUM. UP OF TWO. FIFTY BEDS FOR HOMES THAT HAVE A DELAYED EGRESS WITH A SECURE PERIMETER AROUND IT AND WHILE WE WE'VE NOT DEVELOPED THOSE UNDER THAT THAT- PARTICULAR- CAN EARMARKED AMOUNT- WE HAVE STARTED DEVELOPING- WITHIN SOME OF THE OTHER RESOURCES- SOME OF THE NEEDS. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT ON GOING- DEVELOP MAY NEED THAT IS BY EACH INDIVIDUAL- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING THIRTEEN INDIVIDUALS OUT OF PORTER BILL- SECURE TREATMENT INTO THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER ANOTHER TWENTY INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF. HAVING THEIR TRANSITION REVIEW PLANS- IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED AND MATCHING TO THE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY- AS I. STARTED OFF WITH SAYING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR- THAT THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP THOSE TWENTY BEDS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. US THE TIME TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT. YOUR OUT OF JAIL. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A WAIT LIST ABOUT FIFTY THREE IN WHEN WE AT A LOT RESTRICT SETTINGS. MOVING FROM JAIL TO PORTER BILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE COMPANY COMPETENCY TO. AND BE ABLE TO KNOW BE A TO I DON'T CAN THEY TO THE- WHAT REDUCE. THAT RELIANCE ON THE JAIL AND WE- DEVELOP THOSE. AND THEN BRING BACK THE POPULAR DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU CARDS FROM OHIO. YES HI OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDED- APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND BACK IN FEBRUARY IN PRIMARILY BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT IDEAL TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS SERVED AT THE PORTER BUILDING ELEMENTAL CENTER- HAVING PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS IS LIKELY. NOT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE- FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SO IN THE NEAR TERM- WE SAW THIS AS A AS A GOOD THING FOR. MOVING THOSE FOLKS OUT OF OUT OF COUNTY JAILS. OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ACCORDING TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NASSAR MELINDA'S- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN WHAT IS THE- COST PER PERSON IN THIS PROGRAM. HI NANCY BERGERON I DON'T HAVE THE COST PER PERSON- AVAILABLE GIVING GAS WE'RE HAPPY TO GO AHEAD AND- GET THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED THAT. YOU HAVE LIKE A ROUGH ESTIMATE I MEAN. TOTAL AND- OUR FLIGHT TICKETS A MINUTE TOGETHER NOT FOR YOU OKAY IT'S FINANCE SO THAT. UNFORTUNATELY AVERAGE COST PER PERSON OR A SPECIFIC QUESTION AS DIRECTOR MARGIN MENTIONED HAPPY ALL. OKAY I'M- IN THE IT'S A LITTLE. THE I JUST I AS SOON YOU WOULD HAVE THEM THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A NEW PROGRAM SO JUST HAVE SOME SORT OF IDEA OF HOW MUCH WE'RE SPENDING ON THIS PARTICULAR- PROGRAMS BUT TO. LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THAT INFORMATION FROM YOU. OKAY SIR TARA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. KIND OF I GUESS TIED INTO IT THE COST PER PERSON BUT REALLY I NOTE THAT YOU MENTIONED- BEDS AND I KNOW THAT RECENTLY THE PORTERVILLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WAS USED AS A SEARCH SITES I WAS JUST WONDERING IF. ANY OF THOSE BEDS THAT THAT WERE USED IF THEY'RE- GOING TO BE USED AS PART OF THE- YOU KNOW. THE TRANSITION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU SENATOR D'AMATO- B. THERE'S TWO SIDES TO PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THERE'S A SECURE TREATMENT SIDE WHICH- WHEN WE REFER BEHIND THE FENCE THAT REALLY IS LITERALLY BEHIND A FENCE SO THAT SAID SECURITY AREA- THAT IS- UNPROTECTED- AND THEN THERE'S WHAT WE HAD JUST MOVED EVERYBODY FROM THE AIRPORT TO BUILD GENERAL TREATMENT AREA WHICH IS. OUTSIDE THAT IS NOT A SECURED OR LOCKED SETTING AND SO ON OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAD JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS IN THE GENERAL TREATMENT AREA OVER AT PORTER BILL THAT WE HAD MOVED TO THE COMMUNITY AND AS YOU CORRECTLY NOTED THAT WE HAD DEVELOPED FOR SURGE CAPACITY OVER A PORTABLE IN THAT GENERAL TREATMENT AREAS SO IT WASN'T BEHIND THE FENCE. SO IT WASN'T A SECURED AREA SO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN AND THAT GENERAL TREATMENT AREA WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD THEN BE MOVING ON TO A SECURE TREATMENT SETTING- TO DETERMINE COMPETENCY SO USING THAT- RESOURCES OUTSIDE WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE BUT WE DO HAVE EXISTING UNITS BEHIND THE FENCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO- GO AHEAD AND DEVELOP WITH THE USE. OF STAFF FOR THOSE TWENTY INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU. SAY NO QUESTIONS- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I THINK WHAT WE YOU KNOW BUT- BUT SEE THAT. GETTING SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO SERVE THREE WITH L. L. DON BACK UP INTO THE JAIL ALSO THOUGH WE TO. PERHAPS MOVE MORE EXPERT. AND TO MOVE US OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN THAT FOR BILL AND THE COMMITTEE SETTINGS WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE FINAL CALL FOR. FOR THEM AS WELL AND THEREFORE FREE UP BEDS FOR MORE PEOPLE TO. TRANSITION OUT THERE THE COUNTY JAIL SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. CASELOAD THAT LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SO THANKS SO MUCH AGAIN DR APARTMENT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION FOR. THAT PART OF THE SERVICES. ALL RIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE APARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES WE HAVE- JUST ONE ISSUE WHICH IS RELATED TO AGAIN PLEASE ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS. RELATED TO THE MAY- MAJOR MAY REVISE CHANGES. SO IF TWO QUESTIONS THERE THANK YOU. MR STERN COMMITTEE THIS IS DIFFICULT WORK DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. ASIANS THAT WERE ASKED OF US WAS EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF WITHDRAWING BEING. PROPOSED FUNDING SERVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. M. AND THAT'S BASICALLY- NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS SON GENERAL FUND THAT THE THAT THE COUNTIES WERE EXPECTING TO GET THIS YEAR- AS WELL AS THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY GOT LAST YEAR. NOW WITH THE FEDERAL MATCH THAT'S FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. ORIGINALLY THIS MONEY WAS TARGETED TO- BRING THE LOWEST FUNDED TWENTY ONE COUNTIES UP TO THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY. WITH THIS REDUCTION WE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IMMEDIATELY GO RIGHT BACK TO THE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES AND PULL THAT AWAY SO FROM THE METHODOLOGY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE TAKING TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE OVER THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY. AND THE BALANCE ON ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THEM TO FIND IT. WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF THE OVER FUNDING COUNTIES WITHOUT OVERLY. BURDENING THEM. UNFORTUNATELY HAVE THE SMALLER PORTION OF THIS OVERALL STATE BUDGET. ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE. PERCENT OF THE LOCAL TRANSPORT FUNDING SO WE CAN FULLY. EXPLORE THEM TO COVER THE FULL AMOUNT SO THAT'S THE EXPLANATION BETWEEN HOW WE'RE BREAKING DOWN. AND RICK PULLING OUT FIFTY SX MILLION DOLLARS BACK THE SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT THE REPORT THE LEGISLATION EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING. THERE'S SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE GOING ON RIGHT NOW- THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD THE LARGEST THOSE IS THE MIGRATION TO THE CLOUD- OFF OF OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HERE WHICH WE EXPECT AND HOPE WILL- SEE THE SAVINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. I'M CERTAINLY WORKING WITH THE COURTS AND THROUGH OUR ELECTRONIC PROCESS WE'RE TRYING TO SYSTEMATICALLY CHANGEOVER FORMS TOWARDS THE SIGNING AND GETTING ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS BACK AND FORTH TO MINIMIZE- MALAN. AND SPEED UP THE DISTRIBUTION AND RETURN DOCUMENTS. WE IMPLEMENTED TEXT MESSAGING IN JANUARY WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US AND OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND WE HAVE A FEW SMALLER ITEMS THAT ARE GOING FORWARD AS WELL. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND YOUR QUESTIONS. AND ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIRST A COMMENT FROM LMAO. I THANK YOU VERY YOU AGAIN WITH LUNCH PANELISTS OFFICE WAS IN. WHILE THE- IS TO. LOCAL TRANSPORTED FUNDING BY THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT REALLY JUST TRANSLATES TO A NINETEEN MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN THEIR CURRENT BASE FUNDING LEVELS AND THE REASON THAT IS BECAUSE- IT'S THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS CONSISTS. OF TWO DISTINCT COMPONENTS ONE BEING A WITHDRAWAL OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING INCREASE MADE IN JANUARY WHICH SINCE IT HASN'T GONE OUT YET IT WAS A PROPOSAL DOESN'T ACTUALLY. AFFECT CURRENT BASE FUNDING LEVELS. THUS THE REMAINING HALF OF THE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IS TRULY A BASE FUNDING REDUCTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S AN ELIMINATION. OF NINETEEN MILLION. OF A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING AUGMENTATION THAT WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR AS A PART. OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BY JACK. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT END OF THESE TWO COME. ON THE LEDGE MAY WANT TO APPROACH BOTH OF THEM DIFFERENTLY IN THE CASE OF THE BASE FUNDING REDUCTION AS THE DEPARTMENT DESCRIBED. THEIR APPROACH IS TO MINIMIZE THE REDUCTIONS WITHIN THOSE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE UNDERFUNDED PER THEIR NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND WHAT THAT I ESSENTIALLY TRANSLATES TO IS. YOU WOULD SEE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE OVERFUNDED OR TO HAVE ACCESS FUNDS ABOVE THEIR CALCULATED FUNDING NEED YOU WOULD SEE A GREATER REDUCTION IN THEIR BUDGETS- RELATIVE TO THE UNDERFUNDED LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. IF THIS WERE DONE IF THE REDUCTION OF THE BASE FUNDING WERE TO GO THROUGH WE GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH- IN THAT IT BOASTS TRIES TO REDUCE THE- THE FUNDING GAPS WITHIN THE UNDERFUNDED. LCS STAYS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGETING METHODOLOGY BUT IT ALSO MAKES PROGRESS TOWARDS RIGHT SIZING- FUNDING LEVELS FOR THOSE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO HAVE EXCESS FUNDS ABOUT THEIR CALCULATED FUNDING NEEDS. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THIS SPECIFIC REDUCTION- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRIGGER LANGUAGE- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. IF FEDERAL FUNDS WERE RECEIVED AND THESE FUN THE BASE FUNDS WERE REINSTATED- HOW WOULD APPROACH READ ALLOCATING. THOSE DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY- WOULD IT- PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING NEEDS OF THE UNDER FUNDED LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES AND RE ALLOCATING THOSE DOLLARS AND MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS AND ITS- OWN BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. AS FOR THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL WITHDRAWING THE PROPOSED FUNDING INCREASE MADE IN JANUARY- AGAIN REITERATING THAT THIS HAS NO PRACTICAL EFFECT RELATIVE TO CURRENT BASE FUNDING. NEEDS ARE CURRENT BASE FUNDING LEVEL I DID ARE OFF. CAN TO HAVE KIND WITH THE OVERALL. OF THE BUDGET METHOD ON. THAT WAS USED THE CITY FUN OF MY- PROPOSED ENJOY BUT ALSO AS MENTIONED YOU HAND DOWN. THERE WAS A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AS A PART OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS DUE TO CULVERT NINETEEN AND DUE TO THESE FACTORS- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FEDERAL FUNDS ARE PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE MAY STILL WANT TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE AND PUSHING OUT THE CONSIDER. OF THE JANUARY PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AUGMENTATION- AND CONSIDER IT AS A PART OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE. DOESN'T GREATEST DEPARTMENT FINANCE- NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO MAKE BUT IT'S OUR OPENING. RESPOND YEAH. OKAY YOU QUESTIONS CONFIRM MEMBERS. K. C. NINE I WHAT THE LA US AND I THINK THAT NOW. THIS IS MY ROOM A PRESENTATION FOR PERCEIVE IS COME FROM. ELDRED THE NINETEEN MILLION SAID- FROM TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET WHICH HASN'T BEEN RECEIVED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY TO TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET BUT THE LOSS WAS A HE SAYS TOTAL FIFTY SIX MILLION. IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WE LOST SOME MATCHING FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REX 66% MATCHING FUNDS. OKAY ALL RIGHT. YEAH AND AGAIN THESE THESE ARE CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FIFTY SIX MILLION THAT WERE LOSING ACTUALLY ENDS UP IN THE HANDS OF FAMILIES. SO THEY'RE A LITTLE DISCONNECTED THEM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE HANDS OF FAMILY SO THIS IS CHILD SUPPORT OFFICERS THAT- ARE WORKING ACROSS THE STATE AND THE CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS ARE STILL IN PLACE THOUGH THEY ARE BEING AFFECTED BY. THE LOSS OF JOBS AND UNEMPLOYMENT DANCING US MONEY IT'S GOING UP IT'S GOING DOWN YEAH AND SO FAR THERE HASN'T BEEN A DRASTIC DECLINE IN TOTAL OVERALL COLLECTIONS BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE APPROXIMATELY 56% DECLINE IN COLLECTIONS OVER THE SCORE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. OKAY WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN. IS THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE WITH MISSING AT THE FEDERAL MATCH FOR ALSO TAKING AWAY RESOURCES FROM PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO GET. HOPEFULLY MORE MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF FAMILIES- I RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THE YOU KNOW SCIENCE SPIKE KIND OF PLANE AND THERE MAY BE LESS MONEY OUT. THERE FOR CHILD SUPPORT FROM TELLS OF ORDERS. BUT IN ARE. YOU KNOW FOR. OF CHILD'S. HAS RE. IN YOU KNOW RESULT IN ACTUALLY MORE FUN TO FAMILIES. I THINK WE NEED TO EXAMINE THAT VERY CAREFULLY. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AND WE'LL BE TALKING LATER ON ABOUT CAL WORKS AND OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS WHAT STATE PROVIDES DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO. FAMILIES BUT THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MEANS BY WHICH WE PROVIDE. ASSISTANCE TO OUR FAMILIES AND- THAT WOULD BE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THE TRUE COST OF WHAT WERE. ACTUALLY DOING HERE SO. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND FIFTY SIX MILLION TOTAL FUND EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY DOES THAT FINALLY TRANSLATE INTO TERMS OF LOSS OF FUNDS TO FAMILIES WHO NEED TO NEED THESE FUNDS. THAT HELD IT PARTICULARLY CHILDREN SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY- IN TERMS OF EXACTLY WHAT IS THE END RESULTS OF THESE REDUCTIONS. AND THEIR ULTIMATE IMPACT. ALL RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME DATA OR INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND MAKING OUR FUTURE BUDGETARY DECISIONS. OKAY ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- IT'S ACTUALLY IS THERE ANY. FINAL COMMENT FROM AGENCY ABOUT ABOUT THAT I MEAN IS THERE A WAY TO TRY TO GET THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. SO THE DECLINE IN FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL AND STATE MONEY AT AND DROP THIS TO R. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS UP TO THAT POINT SO WE'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROCESS AND THE AMOUNT OF SOME SUPPORT THAT I CAN PROVIDE THE CONSTITUENTS. THE VERY LOWEST FUNDED COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THEY WERE DURING THOSE YEARS THAT DECADE OF FLAT FUNDING AND THE HIGHEST FUNDED COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE COMING DOWN SO THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND CERTAINLY NOT THE BEST SITUATION OR JUST SITUATION WE WANTED TO BE AN BUT- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. ADJUSTMENTS AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. OKAY AND I KNOW THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE- CHILD SUPPORT THE COUNTIES CAME TOGETHER TO COME UP THE NEW METHODOLOGY THAT'S MORE RATIONAL- AND I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- AND I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PRESERVE THAT AS WELL. BUT AGAIN- I JUST KNOW THAT BACK THEN BEFORE WE DID THE AUGMENTATION WE STILL HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT MORE MONEY AND GET IT PLEASE. AND SO WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THINKING IT. MONEY SMART. AND I SPEND A CUTS AND REGARD SINCE WE'RE ALSO IS FEDERAL MAY. THAT ENDED YOU KNOW I'M AND- I THINK WE SHOULD BE A TRY TO MAKE A. BETTER TO. OF THAT MEANS TO CLASS OF FUN STUFF. CELL I APPRECIATE THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DOING THINGS BEFORE BUT I THINK A EVEN BACK THEN THAT'S ACTIVE THE SETTLED WAS GO AFTER A FOR NOT BECAUSE AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WE SHOULD IN THOSE FRONT THIS ONE LEVELS. ALL RIGHT OKAY THAT AGAIN PRESS LET'S MOVE ON TO THE PART SOCIAL STARTING WITH ISSUE ONE WHICH IS CHILD WILL SERVICE AND CUT CONTINUE OF CARE OF. A ACTION IN SHARED MANY YEARS YOUR CHANCE CALIBER DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. ARE JUST VERY. SO THAT AS WE HAVE RECORD. THAT COULD NOT. IT'S NOT. SOMETHING SHE'S. JUST VERY EVEN WERE. AND HAVING THIS REPORT. AND ON THE THAT ARE LIVING. TO PAY. SO OUR STATE NET FOR. I THAT WEIRD MINISTER IN WITH PARTNERS WITH CAL. IN A KEY. PART AS- AS TO. AND AT INDIVIDUAL AND FOR. IN THIS ARE VERY VERY TO. I OUT MUCH OF WHAT. FULL WAS GOING INTO. TOWN THE CONVERSE. WERE TRYING TO MAKE. L. THRESHOLD ARE CROSSED SAFETY NET. AND ALL MAINTAIN THE LEVEL AND SO. I THAT WAS AS A MARKETING. AT THESE ISSUE. I HAVE KALI THAT ARE OUT HERE I WOULD THROUGH THE PART AND ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT I WILL TRY IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS. S. IN YOUR- THANK YOU. OKAY BUT THANK YOU SIR JUST FROM TO FIND SO IN REGARDS QUESTION ONE THINK ONE OF THE WHERE I CAN ENTER FORTY. IS THE GREAT ON ONE OF ONE TRAINING TO MANAGE COINCIDE WITH YOUR AND I'M RECOVERY SO WHY IS HE MISSED PROPOSED. REDUCTIONS FOR THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTS TREATMENT AS AN ARMED AS THE GOVERNORS EXPRESSED ON THE DURING THIS RESEARCH IN EUROVISION AND THIS WAS JUST IN SEVERAL OF THE HARD OF PART A. AS WITH ALL THE REDUCTIONS AND SOLUTIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAYOR OF BEIJING. WE ARE LOOKING AT AN OUT YEAR DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE BILLION SO THAT'S WHY I'M SPECIFICALLY IN THIS CASE WE'D BE LOOKING AT AN ONGOING REDUCTION IN THIS CASE AND NOT LOOKING A IT AS- A ONE TIME AND SOMETHING TO LOOK AT. LATER ON IT'S IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED BUDGET AND CONTINUE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR PROGRAMS AS WELL AS- MAINTAINING AT LEAST SOME SORT OF LEVEL OF GRANTS FOR. PROGRAMS ALREADY EXISTENCE. THIS IS THE APPROACH. IT NEEDS TO TAKE UNFORTUNATELY. I'LL LEAVE IT TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS I'LL TRY TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS THREE AND FOUR WHERE WHAT'S RELATED TO- WHAT I CAN ACTUALLY I'M SORRY ALTHOUGH I DON'T TRY TO. RESPOND THE QUESTION NUMBER TWO AND- DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED AT LEAST- CREATURE BUT- OTHER QUESTION WITHOUT PROPOSES SPECIAL ON THE LEVEL OF CARE RATES. AND IF THOSE ARE FACTORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING THOSE RATES THE RESPONSE TO THAT IS NO- THE SUSPENSIONS ONLY GONNA BRING NEW CASES IN THE EXISTING CASES WILL MAINTAINING OUR- RATES- FOR THE DURATION OF TIME. THAT THEY ARE IN FOSTER CARE. QUESTION THREE YOU CAN JUST READ ACROSS SYSTEMS THE INTO CARE REFORM RECONCILIATION METHODOLOGY. SO I'M GOING TO WHAT THE MAIN REVISION IS JUNE AND THEN- ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO THE SPECIFIC- METHODOLOGIES THAT WORK WITH WITH THE ACCOUNT OF OUR DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. ZHANG ASSUMES FOR THE CONTINUED OUR REFORM RECONCILIATION WORK LOAD THAT WAS CONSIDERED NOT RELYING ON. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENTS- SO FOR THIS PURPOSE IS WHAT WAS LOOK AT WHAT IS THE ATUAL COUNTY COSTING IMPLEMENTS OR TO WORK WITH THAT THAT NEW REQUIREMENT WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE- CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS REQUIREMENT OF THE CONTINUING CARE OR. OR SO. ASIAN ASSUMES THAT THE RESPONSE OF FOR SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE EITHER I WORK WITH THEM EVEN IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS THE- UPPER DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SUCH AS RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL AND THE FOSTER PARENTS ARE RECRUITMENT RETENTION SUPPORT THAT THOSE. ARE ALSO A REAL CONCERN IN THE REAR INCLUDED EXCUSE ME IN THAT YOU'D ALSO LIKE TO REALIGN. SO BEING THAT THEY WERE INCLUDED ON THOSE WORK STATEWIDE REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATIONS AND CHARLOTTE I MEAN SHE WAS NOT. SO THAT'S THE- WHERE THE MEETING MAY REVISION METHODOLOGY- ADDRESSES THE RECONCILIATION- IN REGARDS TO WHY THE FAMILY OR THE RESPONSE SYSTEM IS PROPOSED FOR ELIMINATION- SAY STATEMENTS BOSSES EARLIER- THE- UNIVISION AT. OPPOSES TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY AND GRANTS FOR PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED- SO IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE DIFFICULT DECISIONS AS YOUR CALL AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS WAS SOMETHING TO BE FUNDED BY. THE OKAY AND I THINK IN MY ARM AND I WAS JUST REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS HE'S COMMENTED. ON PUBLICLY. DURING HIS MAY REVISION DISCUSS WITH TO HOW MUCH FUNDING WILL BE. TO MANAGE LEADERS THE PRO. I'M MY SON IS A WERE TO THE TRIGGER IT THAT. THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE MAIN REVISION. IF WE'RE WE'RE BASING EVERYTHING OFF OF THE LEVEL OF FUNDING WAS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH IS FIFTEEN MILLION GENERAL FUNDS AND THEN ONGOING THIRTY NINE GENERAL FINDS THAT SCENE I WOULD LOOKING AT. I WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A FEDERAL WAIVER HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED YET. AS YOU GET OLDER- DRAW DOWN FEDERAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE FIRST PROGRAM SO UNLESS I GET A LEADERSHIP DIRECTOR JOHNSON CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ON THIS BUT- GENERAL FUNDS- FIFTY MILLION AND ONE YEAR AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY. TO MAINTAIN THIS PROGRAM. WITH REGARDS TO THE QUESTION OF PRIVATIZING THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE MISSING THIS MEANS THE TRIGGER FUNDING I. THE RESPONSE TO THAT IS IT- THEY WERE VISION ASSUMES THAT FULL FEDERAL FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED TO SUPPORT ALL THE ISSUES ARE LISTED AS TRIGGERS ARE STRUCTURE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE REVISION. TO THE EXTENT THAT ADEQUATE FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED THAT YOU PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR ALL THE ISSUES OR. SOLUTIONS INCLUDING THE MARRIAGE AND- THAT WE NEED TO WE CAN CONVERSE. WITH ALLEGED AND THE MINISTRY. ON OUR PRIOR TO THE STREETS. OKAY I PREFER PREACHER I JUST CLARIFY SO. AND THE FIRST IS PROBABLY JUST AN EXAMPLE EXAMPLE WHEN WE DO HAVE SOME PROGRAMS ARE BEING CUT RATE. OTHER PROGRAMS BEING ELIMINATES THE FERS BEING PROPOSED FOR ELIMINATION SO WHEN YOU ELIMINATE A PROGRAM RESTARTING IT. TAKES TIME STAFF AT CETERA SO I GUESS THIS IS THE CLARIFY THAT PART OF THE QUESTION FOR FINANCE. IS THAT OKAY WE'LL LEMONADE THE PROGRAM IS PROPOSED AND THEN WE HAVE FEDERAL FUNDS WE SAY OKAY LET'S START IT UP ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE CAN JUST INSTANTLY BRIE BRING BACK THE PROGRAM WITH- IF WE HAVE FIFTEEN MILLION BACK TO ITS YOU KNOW FORMER STATE OR- WITH SOME OF THOSE FUNDS ACTUALLY NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO AGAIN ADMINISTRATIVELY YOU HIRE THE PEOPLE YOU NEED ALL THE OTHER STUFF. TO GET THE PROGRAM STARTED AGAIN SO THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTIONS LIKE ARE WE USUALLY WHEN YOU. PLAY SOMEONE OFF. HIRING EVEN HIRING THE SAME PERSON BACK COSTS MONEY VERSES IF YOU JUST GET THEM EMPLOYED. NOW COURSES OF THE COST TO CONTINUE TO PLAY SOMEONE BUT I MEAN WHEN YOU LET SOMEONE GO YOU MEAN ARE YOU ELIMINATE A PROGRAM AND TRY TO BRING IT BACK. THAT ACTUALLY TAKES MONEY AS WELL AND THAT ACTUALLY DRAWS MONEY AWAY FROM THE SERVICES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MR DO IT SO CAN CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. THAT SITUATION. ABSOLUTELY AND ALL OF OUR LAND GEORGIA JOHNSON IN CASE I MISREPRESENT ANYTHING TO LEASE THE LAND BUT- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE FIRST PROGRAM IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET THE APARTMENT LIST ON THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A FINALIST THE CONTRACTS SO WITH RUNS REGARDS YOUR QUESTIONS ON. WHEN YOU'RE LAYING OFF STAFF THE NEED TO BRING THEM OUT MY DAY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THE- ONLY WANTS TO BE INCLUDED IN. THE BUDGET FOR THIS OR LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD- BASED ON THAT WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT AT. A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN- WE TYPICALLY OFFER A PROGRAM IT'S. AND THEN ELIMINATED BECAUSE- HE HAS REALLY. START YET OR ARE. I READ ON THIS BUT AGAIN ALL THE FURNITURE JOHNSON IF I MISSED. OKAY DIRECTOR JOHNSON. THAT'S CORRECT. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO MAKE IT TO THE ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS FROM FINANCES PRESENTATION. NOW. DOCTOR JOHNSON ANY OTHER COMMENTS- IN RELATION TO THE FOUR QUESTIONS CORRECT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO ADD OKAY THE SPURS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED SO THAT'S THAT DISTINGUISHING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BETWEEN THE ISSUE OF ELIMINATION OKAY THANK YOU HI- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SIR MELINDA'S THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I SO THE LEVEL OF CARE RATES ARE DESIGNED TO I GUESS HELP WITH THE FOSTER YOUTH YOU HAVEMORE COMPLEX ISSUES WHETHER IT'S PHYSICAL OR ORDERED PSYCHOLOGICAL MENTAL CHALLENGES SO IF FOR LOWERING THESE RATES. I'M JUST CURIOUS IF WE CAN GET COMMENT ON HOW PARENTS HERB FOSTER PARENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO. ME AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THESE USED TO I JUST WANTED. SEE THEM PUT IN MORE PERIL THAN IS NECESSARY AND HAS THAT BEEN CONTEMPLATED GIVEN THE FACT THAT I GET I GET IT EVERYBODY HAS TO MAKE CUTS BUT THIS IS A GROUP THAT IS- YOU KNOW MORE AT RISK THAN PERHAPS. SAY SOME OTHERS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS JENNIFER TRY YEAH- WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR- I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE RATES- ARE A PART OF THE- CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM INITIATIVES. AT THEY WERE IN INCREASED BETTER RATE OVER WHAT EXISTED PRIOR TO C. C. R. FOR ALL FAMILIES SO THE BASIC LEVEL OF CARE RATE AND THAT IS. NOT BEING CHANGED BY THIS PROPOSAL IS ALREADY AN INCREASED RATE FROM WHERE WE WERE A FEW YEARS AGO- AND HOPEFULLY IT'S HELPFUL FOR THOSE PURPOSES AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE OTHER ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF KERR READ WERE INTENDED TO- TO DISTINGUISH AMONG FAMILIES WITHIN THAT AND THAT THAT CONVERSATION CAN. YOU WORK WITH TIME BUT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD NOT BE USING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE GREAT AND- IT DISTINGUISH BUT ALL FAMILIES HAVE RECEIVED AN INCREASE. BASED ON CPR. I THINK YOU I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING THOUGH IS REASON THAT THERE'S RATES WERE AND IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED WAS BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE NECESSARY TO CARE PROPERLY FOR THESE PARTICULAR- YOUTH SO. TAKING IT AWAY IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THEM AND I JUST AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW WE EXPECT PARENTS IN THE RECRUITMENT EFFORT FRANKLY TO RICK YOU NEED TO RECRUIT PARENTS TO TAKE ON. HE'S WITH CHALLENGES LIKE THESE SO THAT THEY ARE IN THE HOME AND THEY CAN THRIVE AND BE SUCCESSFUL AND BUT THE PARENTS ALSO HAVE THE AT THE RESOURCES TO CARE FOR THEM PROPERLY. I APPRECIATE THAT THE ONE THING I- WAITED CLARIFY. IS THAT NO ONE WOULD BE RECEIVING A RATE. REDUCTION AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING I'M HERE WITH THE LEVEL OF CARE RATE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT SOME OF THE HIGHER RATES THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ADDITIONAL FAMILIES. THEY WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING THAT INCREASE- BUT THEY WILL NOT BE RECEIVING A DECREASE AS A RESULT OF. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE TWO WHICH IS THE- SSI S. S. P. UP. COLA. OKAY SO- I THINK ELLIE IS GOING TO PRESENT ON THIS. THIS IS ANGELA SHORT FROM- FROM THE LA OKAY- I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S- PROPOSALS FOR CHILD WELFARE- OKAY BOTH OKAY YEAH PLEASE DO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO BEFORE WE MOVE ON SS I WENT BACK TO- YES PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU- SO FIRST CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE DEATH OF A SOCIAL WORKER RATE INCREASE THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET- WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT SINCE MAY REVISION- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS COULD BE DRAWN DOWN COULD BE DRAWN DOWN FOR FFA'S BASED ON RESULTS OF A FEDERAL TIME STUDY- AND WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING ON THE DETAILS. OF JUST HOW MUCH COULD BE AVAILABLE AND WHETHER THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH- TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE FSA. SOCIAL WORKER RATE INCREASES NEXT REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO REDUCE S. T. R. T. P. RATES BY FIVE PERCENT. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS REDUCTION- WE KNOW THAT THE LARGEST LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH- TESTED MINISTRATION IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER REGULATORY FLEXIBILITIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO ALLOW STR TEEPEES TO SAFELY OFF. COSTS AND MITIGATE THESE LOWER RATES. MOVING ON TO THE PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE FERS. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO- TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THE PARENTS ANONYMOUS HOTLINE AND THIS IS A HOT LINE THAT WAS RECENTLY FUNDED UNDER AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN RESPONSE TO COOK BUT NINETEEN. OF WHETHER THIS HOTLINE COULD BE USED- TO SUPPORT FIRST IN SOME WAY AS A COST SAVING MEASURE. THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION IF THERE IS A WAY TO US STILL BACK THE PROGRAM RATHER THAN ELIMINATING IT ENTIRELY- GETTING TO THE POINT THAT YOU ADMIT SENATOR PAM. AND FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT. ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SUSPENDS THE LEVEL OF CARE- RATES TWO THROUGH FOUR- SO JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY HAS TWO DISTINCT COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT RELATES TO FF EIGHT PLACEMENTS. YOU'VE PLACED WITH FFA CURRENTLY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ELLIS SEES TWO THROUGH FOUR UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AT THAT THEY IS ALL ABOUT THEY USED ALREADY RECEIVING THOSE RATES WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEM BUT NEW FSA PLACEMENTS WOULD NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THEM IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE SECOND STAGE COMPONENT RELATES TO COUNTY APPROVED FAMILY HOMES USE IN THESE PLACEMENTS ARE NOT YET RECEIVING LOC STRAIGHT THROUGH FOR- BECAUSE THE LOC PROTOCOL TOOL HAS NOT YET BEEN. IMPLEMENTED FOR THIS PLACEMENT TYPE. I AND IN FACT FOR THE ROLL OUT OF THE LOC PROTOCOL TOOL HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DELAYED INDEFINITELY. SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL REALLY IT WOULD SOLIDIFY THAT THIS ROLL OUT WOULD NOT BE HAPPENING FOR COUNTY FAMILY HOMES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M GIVEN THESE TWO DISTINCT COMPONENTS ONE ALTERNATIVE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WOULD BE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE- LOC SKEWED THROUGH FORTS AT THAT THEY USE- SO IN OUR VIEWTHIS WOULD CONTINUE THEIR CURRENT POLICY- WELL SUSPENDING THE ROLLOUT OF LOC ISSUED THROUGH FOR. TO NINE OTHER DAY PLACEMENTS AND AGAIN THIS IS ALREADY BEEN DELAYED AND LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAR- ANYHOW. WHILE THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD ACHIEVE LESS SAVINGS THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AND ARGUE IT WOULD CONTINUE CURRENT POLICY AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND JUST HOW MUCH THIS ALTERNATIVE COULD COST SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I CAN. THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE I THINK WHEN WE WENT TO FINANCE I GOT THROWN OFF MY RHYTHM THERE. ALL RIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM LA OF THE AND HOPE WE CAN NOW WORK ON THE THOSE- SUGGESTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS. AS WE WORK THROUGH. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE ON THE BUDGET. RIGHT C. NINE THEN THAT'S A ON THEN TO IS NUMBER TWO. RICK S. S. I. S. S. P. PRESENTING ON- GO AHEAD AND TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MR LEE RELATED TO THE ONGOING QUESTION. ALL RIGHT FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO LA AFTER THAT. HERE IS THE GAME FOR US OKAY. X. SO ON THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER. THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE TO MAKE THIS ON GOING BACK TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN IS ELOQUENT STATED EARLIER. WE HAVE A BUDGET DEFICIT THAT'S REJECTED ME ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS SO WE NEED AN ONGOING SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY MAY REVISION NEXUS WILL HOLD ON CALLING THIS. TIME OKAY. THANK YOU L. L. COMMENTS. YEAH AND JACKIE WERE CERTAINLY I'LL- WHICH I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT S. ISIS P. CONSISTS OF BOTH THE STATE PROVIDED US IS P. GRANT AND THEN ALO THE FEDERALLY PROVIDED ASSISTS I GRANT SO YOUR AGENDA MAKES NOTE OF THE ESTIMATED TOTAL LOSSES ISIS P. GRANT LEVELS AS ESTIMATED BACK IN JANUARY- RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY ESTIMATES THE MAY REVISION- SHOWS THAT TOTAL SIZES S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS- ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LOWER. AND THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE PROPOSAL TO NOT PASS THROUGH THE FEDERALIST ASIDE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OR COLA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS REDUCING THE STATE S. S. P. GRANTS ARE BY- THE AMOUNT OF THE FEDERAL SSI COLA IN THE PAST RECESSIONS THE STATE WAS ABLE TO REDUCE AS P. GRANT LEVELS BY THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERALIST COLA WHICH WOULD RESULT IN GRANT LEVELS REMAINING FLAT YEAR TO YEAR- HOWEVER IN THIS CASE WE WOULD NOTE THAT BECAUSE OF THE FEDERALLY REQUIRED. MINIMUM GRANT AMOUNT TOTAL SIZE IS P. GRANT LEVELS MAY ACTUALLY STILL SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE RELATIVE TO TWENTY TWENTY LEVELS- I'M CURRENTLY IN THE STATE S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS ARE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE FEDERALLY REQUIRED MINIMUM- FOR THE MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL GRANTS WERE ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS ABOVE- WHEREAS FOR THE MAXIMUM COUPLES GRANTS FOR ABOUT ELEVEN DOLLARS ABOVE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM. I'M SO BASED OFF OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF THE FEDERAL SSI COLA IT IS OUR SIZE MEANT THAT THE STATE CAN ONLY DECREASE S. S. P. GRANT AMOUNTS BY A PORTION OF THE FEDERAL INCREASE TO THE SSI GRANTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FEDERAL REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN GRANT LEVELS AT THE FEDERALLY REQUIRED MINIMUM AMOUNT. SO AS A RESULT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE TOTAL IS A SCIENCE IS P. GRANT LEVELS WILL STILL EXPERIENCE AGAIN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TWENTY. TWENTY ONE ALBEIT BY A LOWER MOUNT OPTION OF THIS FOR. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT OVER WE ASK KNOW THE AND OF THE FEDERAL A CYCLE AND DOES THE FINAL OF STATE S. S. P. GRANT RIGHT UNTIL THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. HEY THANK YOU QUESTIONS REMEMBERS RIGHT. SO I WOULD JUST MAKE THE OBSERVATION I NOTICED SOMETHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE PASS BUDGET TIMES- BUT I DO. FIND IT- AND- AROUND EXTRA RATE WORD THAT ON ONE HAND WE'RE HOPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE US FUNDS- TO FILL AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE DISTRIBUTORS WERE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE IN THE BUDGET. AND YET AT THE IMES WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES GIVE US MORE MONEY FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE IN THIS CASE TO THESE- PEOPLE ON. SSI THEN WE TAKE THE MONEY AND WE PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING WE DO THAT- SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A BUDGET CHALLENGE AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON THAT- BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS IS A- AREA WHERE WE'VE SPENT UNDER FUNDING WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK AT STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE FUNDING TO THESE. THESE INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY GIVES US SOME MORE MONEY WE ARE THEN AT LEAST TAKING A PORTION OF IT AWAY. TO FOR OTHER THINGS SO- I'D- JUST A- TROUBLED BY THAT LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. FOR RIGHT NOW OKAY AND- HOPEFULLY ACTUALLY JESSICA SO I UNDERSTAND LOL USED YOU SAID THAT WE WON'T ACTUALLY KNOW UNTIL THE FALL AS TO EXACTLY HOW MUCH BUT- YOUR- DETERMINATION BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST PRESENTED THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT REALLY GOING TO GET. THE THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION- GENERAL FUND BY SHIFTING IS PROBABLY NOT. AS PART OF THE LESSON THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I KNOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE CAN PRODUCE S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS BY THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL FEDERAL SSI GRAIN WHAT. I'M SO THAT THIRTY THREE REALLY REFLECTS ON THE MAX AMOUNT OF SAVINGS WE CAN ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE S. S. P. GRANTS ITSELF DO YOU DO TAT FEDERALLY REQUIRED MINIMUM THRESHOLD. THOSE THINGS ARE LIKELY TO GET LESS THAN THAT RIGHT BECAUSE OF THAT MINIMUM CORRECT. NO I'M THE THIRTY D. REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SAVINGS WE COULD GET OKAY. OKAY SO THAT SO THAT WE COULD WE WILL GET THAT SERVICE THE THIRTY SEVEN REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MINIMUM WE NEED TO GET AND THIS AND HOW MUCH WELL. PREVIOUSLY PROVED WRAPPERS FOR S. S. P. I YES BETWEEN CURRENT LEVELS AND THEN THE FEDERAL MINIMUM AND THE DIFFERENCE IS HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA THEN REDUCE GRANT AMOUNTS WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION- BUT WE WOULD NOTE AGAIN THAT. WE WON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE SSI COLADA OR THEN THE CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TAXES P. GRANTS UNTIL THE FALL SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COLON IT IS REALLY SMALL IN THE SSI. FOR THE AS A SIDE PORTION OF THE GRANT. AND THEN YOU COULD MAYBE SEE LOWER SAVINGS BUT AGAIN- WE COULD ALSO SEE THAT THE CALL WAS STILL IS HIGH ENOUGH WHERE WE'RE STILL MAXIMIZING. THE SAVINGS ON THE S. S. P. SIDE. ALL RIGHT WELL AGAIN. TROUBLING OR EVEN THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ANYWAY SO OKAY. ALL RIGHT. NO THE QUESTIONS AND LET'S MOVE ON T ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. SO WE HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE SITE TO ASSESS. SO. WHO'S PRESENTING ON THAT. FINANCE. THAT'S FINE IS PRESENTING ON ISIS. HEARING YES I WAS GOING TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE QUESTION BUT I THINK JENNIFER YOU WERE ARE YOU. OKAY DID. SO I CAN GO IN RESPONSE TO THE SECOND QUESTION OKAY YOURS BY THE SECOND QUESTION AND WE'LL GO BACK TO AGENCY FOR THE OTHER TWO. ALL RIGHT. SO ON THAT QUESTION IT'S- FURTHER MAYBE VICE WE DID NOT ASSUME ANY. COSTS TO OFFSET THE MARINES WHO ARE THE PROPOSALS AND THE X. YES TO ELIMINATE SEA BASS AND ALSO MISTER SPEAKER- THERE WAS NO. ASCENSION AS TO WHETHER THERE WOULD BE ANY. INCREASED COSTS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM FOR NURSING HOME CARE OKAY. ALL RIGHT I WILL COMMENT ON THAT LATER AFTER WE HEAR THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. OKAY AND MISTER KERR AT GENTRY AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ON THE FIRST QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO BE ENHANCED M. F. MAP AT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IF THEY CAN'T ACT THAT MIGHT BE ON ANY OF OUR REDUCTIN PROPOSALS AT THIS POINT THIS IS THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD AND- ARE HOPEFUL THAT IT WOULD BE AN OPTION- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE RECOGNIZE THAT- BUT THERE IS AN INTERACTION THERE AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH EACH YEAH WHO. HAD THE GREATEST EXPERTISE WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT AND THEN ON THIRD QUESTION. ABOUT THE PAYROLL FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD TRANSFER FROM THE COUNTY THROUGH THE STATE. UNDER THAT PROPOSAL- WHAT WE READ- MENTIONED. OUR OUR EXISTING VENDOR I'M ALREADY PROVIDES A HELP DESK THAT BY THE NUMBER OF RELATED FUNCTIONS AND THAT WE WILL BE ADDING TO THOSE OPTIONS. AT WHAT WOULD BE ADDED IS THEIR ABILITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS RELATED TO- SUPPLEMENTAL TIME SHEET IF THERE ARE HOURS AVAILABLE- THAT W. TO NW FOR TAX FORMS. AND PAYMENT INCREASE THE REPLACEMENT WARREN. AND ASK SOME OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT'S REQUIREMENT AT LONG WITH THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION TIME SHEET RELATED QUESTIONS AND TRAVEL LANE. AT THE AGAIN THESE WOULD BE- WORKLOAD BETTER RELATED TO WORKLOAD THAT THEY ALREADY PERFORM. AT IT WOULD BE ADDED TO THEM AND ADD THE IMPACT OF THAT ON COUNTY STAFF WOULD VARY AT. EACH COUNTY. BECAUSE THE COUNTIES EACH USE THEIR PAYROLL STAFF IN DIFFERENT WAYS CURRENTLY AND THEY MAY BE PROVIDING MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS BEYOND THE ONES THAT. I EIGHT CHIP REID. OKAY THANK YOU LA COMMON. HI JUST WITH REGARDS TO THE 7% REDUCTION- JUST KEY QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ONE- WHETHER THIS WOULD BE ALLOWABLE UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL RULES THAT DICTATE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH STATES NEEDED HERE TO IN ORDER TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL F. MAP OR FEDERAL MATCH FOR MEDICAID PROGRAMS ALSO GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT STEPS THE DEPARTMENT- WOULD TAKE TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE- SAFETY AND HEALTH I JUST AS RECIPIENTS. AND LASTLY- GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW A POSSIBLE LITIGATION ON THIS POINT COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF THE SAVINGS THEMSELVES. OKAY THANK YOU- AND FINANCE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS CENTER YOU ANSWERED QUESTION NUMBER TWO. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON ONE AND THREE. NO I DIDN'T ASK HER OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY GOING TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO ALL RIGHT. SO THE FIRST OF ALL. I THINK SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS I MADE ABOUT THE M. S. S. P. PROGRAM AT SEA BASS SAME WITH HSS. WE DO HAVE- INFORMATION THAT- ISIS S. REDUCES INITIALIZATION LOUD PEOPLE TO STAY AT HOME- WHICH IS LESS COSTLY THAN. BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED AND THAT'S A AND THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE ACTUAL SAVINGS ARE FROM A REDUCTION IN SERVICE HOURS WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S THE COST OF THE ALTERNATIVE SO THE ALTERNATIVE IS YOU KNOW WEEDS NOW WE'RE LIMITED THE HOURS AND SELF A CERTAIN PORTION. OF PEOPLE WHO THOSE HOURS OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME VERSUS BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE WE NEED TO FACTOR THAT COST IN. SO AND CAN BE HARD TO DETERMINE BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEN BECOMES A VERY REAL COST. THE OTHER ISSUE- AND GUESTS ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT A SOCIETY IS THAT YES ON ONE LEVEL WERE HOPING FOR FEDERAL MONEY TO HELP MAKE UP SOME OF THE GAPS. AND SO WE WERE DOING THIS TRIGGER THING. BUT SAME TIME TO THROW MONEY AT THE FEDERAL. WELL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED US AN ENHANCED. F. MAP THAT RELATE TO THE DISASTER. AND WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THOSE FUNDS AND THEN RE DIVERTING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO THE FEDS COULD COME AND SAY WELL BY THE WAY WE DID GIVE YOU MORE MONEY HE JUST DIDN'T SPEND IT ON WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO SPEND IT ON THE ITEM WE ACTUALLY GAVE YOU THE ENHANCED PAYMENT FOR. SUCH AS I. HSS OR BETTER CAL OR SO FORTH YOU DECIDE TAKE THAT INCREASE AND SEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND I THINK THAT WEAKENS OUR POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR EVEN MORE FUNDING SO- SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A BIT CHALLENGING AS WELL I MEAN- YOU KNOW WE'LL SEE WHAT CONGRESS AND- AND SO FORTH THAT. DO AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE CERTAINLY IS- THE FEDERAL RULES AROUND IT AS WELL I KNOW THAT- IS BROUGHT THIS UP TO MULTIPLE OCCASIONS BUT- WELL I JUST ASK- FINANCE- IS DEAD. I MEAN WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CUTS THAT YOU'RE MAKING- PARTICULARLY TO. CERTAIN PROGRAMS- DON'T VIOLATE THE PARAMETERS DASHED WISH FOR. US WE THE ENHANCED MAPS A RESULT OF THE DISASTER SO WE- AS EARLIER POINTED OUT THERE ARE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO MEET. DOOR TO GET THAT ENHANCED F. MAP- CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE MINISTRATIONS- WELL. CONFIDENCE THAT- THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED A DOESN'T VIOLATE THOSE CONDITIONS. BURLINGAME REFINANCING AND MEAN THERE'S NEVER A GUARANTEE UNLESS UNTIL WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH OUR GOVERNMENT SO UNTIL THEN IT'S HARD FOR US HELLO WHAT IS THE- PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THE FED'S GONNA DO BUT I MEAN WE'LL KEEP YOU GUYS IN THE LOOPAS WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND TO ACCEPT THAT WE DO FIND THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DUES- DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THIS PURPOSE WILL HAVE TO YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS ISSUE AGAIN BUT FOR THE TIME BEING WE ARE MAKING THOSE ASSESSMENTS WERE TALKING TO. DCS AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND PERHAPS ASK WE WERE HEARING FROM DHS THAT. THAT ENHANCED F. MAP REPRESENTS HOW MUCH IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE RECEIVING. CANCEL THAT QUESTIONS ARE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IT'S UP IT'S OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND FOR THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AGAIN SORRY I DIDN'T QUITE GET. THE DOLLARS. OKAY SORRY IF WE CAN GET A GOOD PICK UP ON THAT SEE REPEAT THAT. FURTHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DELIVERED OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION OKAY. THE BUDGET YEAR WORKS AND NOW WE'RE A LITTLE A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED. I JUST I JUST OKAY THAT'S JUST FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS ALONE RIGHT. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR- THE OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAMS SO I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION OKAY SO JUST POINT OUT JUST FOR IHS US ALONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION- BUT IF WE DO IF WE BUT IF THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT AND- WE LOSE THE F. MAP IT'LL BE MUCH MUCH LARGER SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT. CORRECT THAT IS RIGHT. OKAY SO- I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE AT A CONSIDERATION. IN OUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS OKAY.

SO AND YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHICH IS TO DESCRIBE THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE ASSUMPTION THAT TAKE UP IN COST PER EACH RELATED TO COOLING NINETEEN HE'S- WILL BE LOWER THAN AVERAGE. SO THESE CHANGES WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR- THE NAME OF ASIA STUDENTS NOT FINDING WHERE EXISTING HOW WORKS SAID EIGHT BTC ON CRAIT SERVICE UTILIZATION AND COST FACTORS OR THE NEW CASES COMING ON TO THE PROGRAM YOU WILL BE NINETEEN CRISIS AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN NEW YOU HE KNEW HE SAID.

HE AND COOLING SERVICE OR DID LEARNING FROM THE FROM. IN A LIMITED NUMBER. OF SURPRISING HOW. I BUT YOU WANT ME TO MOVE ON TO THE PART OR YES YES PLEASE CAN TO UNTIL YOU AN ALL EACH OF COURSE. OKAY SO YOUR SECOND QUESTION IS TO DISCUSS THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE PROPOSED REDUCTION IN SUBSIDIZING KLEENEX IN RESPONSE AFTER ASSERTION THAT THIS PROGRAM IS THE LIKELY PATH WHEN YOU'RE IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS OF A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE FIRST LIKE YOU KNOW NIGHT WE RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS OF OBJECTS AND THIS PROPOSAL WAS NOT MADE LIGHTLY HOWEVER GIVEN THE STATE. BUDGET RIGHT THE- PRIORITY IS PRESERVE. AND HASH LEVEL FOR. MOST VULNERABLE. IN ORDER TO DO THAT SOME REDUCTIONS WERE NECESSARY IN HOW IT WORKS SERVICE. THE NAME OF ASIAN REDUCES ALL BUT THE BASE FUNDING FOR THE POWER SUBSIDIZED. GRAHAM I'M VERY QUESTION WHICH IS HOW HOW WORKS RECIPIENTS CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN A SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS BE AFFECTED BY THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROTECT YOU YOUR NAME WAIT UNTIL LIKE ONE TWENTY TWENTY- IF THIS PROPOSAL IS FREE WE KNOW THAT THE NEIGHBOR VISION INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE POWER TO IMPLEMENT SERVICES FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCRETION. TO DETERMINE WHAT SERVICES TO DELIVER CHEAP HIGH. INCLUDING I THINK. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT. ME TO THESE THANK YOU PROPOSALS HOW WE LIKE ALSO THAT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WHEN BUSINESSES REVEALED RATIONS THE EMPLOYERS WILL HIRE PARTICIPATES WITH THE JOB SKILLS AND JOB EXPERIENCE IS. BEING FROM THEIR PREVIOUS STUFF AND I THINK. WE MET. ADDITIONALLY SOME SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT PARTICIPATE YOU ARE CONTINUING TO COLLECT WE- EVEN HAVE WORKSITE FOR SHUT DOWN. REGIS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. YEAH AND INSTEAD SEEK UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS OR BEGIN COLLECTING HIGHER POWER WORKS GRANTS. TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS YES. NOT QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO THE WHOLE VISITING PROGRAMS TO YOUR QUESTION IS HOW WILL BE ARMY'S CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE POWER OVER THE PROGRAM YEAH IT'S LIKE A REDUCTION IN FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. THE REVISION RATE WOULD YOU SAY- THE WHOLE MAKING PROGRAM BY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HI IT'S CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THAT HOW IT WORKS PROGRAM WILL VERY LIKELY NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS THE SPENDING REDUCTION. CHANGING THE ECONOMY NEEDS ME PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. PROXIMALLY A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE CURRENT PROPOSAL INCLUDES FINDING NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS IN LINE WITH WHAT IT'S CRACKED ME UP THANK YOU FOR THE CURRENT YEAR FOR EXISTING CLIENTS. WE KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW AND. IT'S STILL IN THE FACE. AND I'M BACK NO OTHER QUESTIONS FOR US OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH COMMENTS FROM LA L. YES GOOD AFTERNOON- RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A FEW COMMENTS. FIRST ON THE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING UTILIZATION OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CHILD CARE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT MINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED A COMPELLING REASON. FOR THIS REVISED ASSUMPTION WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE THAT- MANY OF THE NEW CASES THAT WILL SEE IN CAL WORKS ARE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE RECENTLY UNEMPLOYED AND THEREFORE I HAVE A LOT OF WORK READY SKILLS ALREADY- A LOT OF COUNTIES AND ADVOCATES MADE THE COUNTERPOINT. THAT MANY OF THESE FOLKS WILL BE COMING FROM INDUSTRIES LIKE HOSPITALITY SECTOR THAT MAY TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE CURRENT ECONOMIC COLLAPSE BUT IN THE US MAY REQUIRE INTENSIVE SUPPORT TO RETRAIN FOR OTHER DISTRICTS- IT ALSO LOOK BACK AT THE STATES EXPERIENCED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND SAW THAT THERE WAS ONLY A MODEST DECREASE IN THE REALISATION IMPLEMENT SERVICES AT THAT TIME. AND THAT REALLY WASN'T EVEN AN ORGANIC DECREASE THAT WAS SPURRED ON BY DELIBERATE. DECISIONS MADE ON THE POLICY. WITH YOUR TO THE- EMANATES NO FUNDING FOR EXPANDED SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT OR YOU THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER MORE MODEST REDUCTION OF ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE EMPHASIZE IN ANALYZING MAY REVISION PROPOSALS WAS THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN NOT MAKING POLICY DECISIONS THAT MIGHT WORSEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR DAMPEN FUTURE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT IS ONE OF THE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAS GENERALLY BEEN SEEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE MACROECONOMIC SACKED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT A LOT OF MONEY INSTEAD CAUSING SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT DURING THE LAST RECESSION IN STUDIES OF THAT- EXPENDITURE THAT GENERALLY BEEN POSITIVE SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE BASED TO AT LEAST CONSIDER ARE CAUGHT IT IS NOT. A COMPLETE ELIMINATION FINALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE ELIMINATION OF FUNDING FOR THE CAL OR PROGRAM THERE'S SORT OF A DELICATE BALANCING ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE. NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF HERE THE US STATE AND MANY STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED YEARS INTO DEVELOPING IMPROVED ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT SYSTEM THIS WAS TO BE THE FIRST YEAR WHEN THAT REALLY. HIT THE GROUND AND STARTED RUNNING. EVEN WITHOUT THIS FUNDING REDUCTION COUNTY ARE UNDER SUCH A- PRESSURE RIGHT NOW DEALING WITH EXISTING WORKFLOW. AND THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO- VOICES NEW RESPONSIBILITIES UPON THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME BUT IT'S IMPORTANT ARE WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THAT MOMENTUM THAT WE BUILT AND SO IT'S JUST ABOUT FINDING THAT BALANCE OF WHAT IS PRACTICAL GIVEN THE REALITIES OF. ACCOUNTING WORK. AND THAT WOULD BE MY REMARKS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OUR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACTUALLY REFER TO A FINANCE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. I KNOW YOU DID INITIALLY ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR FINANCE. OKAY I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I KNOW YOU PRESENTED DIRECT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M SO THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS AN INCREASE IN THE CASELOAD SOUNDS LIKE SO BUT IF THAT CASE LOAD DOES NOT RISE AS SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS IS. HAS THERE BEEN GIVEN THOUGHT TO- KIND OF RE YOU KNOW RE EVALUATING MID YEAR SO THAT THAT FUNDING CAN GO TO PERHAPS OTHER RECIPIENTS LIKE SSI RECIPIENTS OR- YOU KNOW GOING TOWARDS COAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S AT. LEAST IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT TO PIVOT- SHOULD THIS NOT TURN OUT THE WAY THEY'RE EXPECTING. SERVICE CENTERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. I WAS A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE JUST KNOW THAT- EXPANDED SUB STARTED QUITE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER REDUCTIONS YOU'RE SEEING REPOSE HOURS PROGRAM ARE IN LINE WITH OUR FEDERAL TRIGGERS AND WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WILL STEP DOWN IN THE SYSTEM PROVIDING FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT TO YOUR POINT OUT SHOULD CASELOAD NOT REACH THE LEVELS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY PROJECTING WE DO CONTINUE TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO MAKE. MODIFICATIONS IT. WAS A PROVISION AUTHORITY. BUDGET BILLING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. A THIRD TITLE. SIR JUST ONE EXPRESS- YOU KNOW OUT OF CONCERN OF PERSONAL HEALTH AND DUE TO LOSS OF JOBS THAT CALIFORNIANS ALL OVER THE STATE ARE SEEKING FOOD ASSISTANCE AND- I KNOW THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT THE LONG LINES- YOU KNOW THE FOOD BANKS AND DIFFERENT PLACES AND FOLKS JUST IN SEARCH OF. A FISA. TRYING TO ACCESS FOOD. SO WHEN IT COMES TO TWO ARE ALTERED IN OLDER ADULTS- THAT ARE YOU KNOW HIGHEST RISK IN. THEIR ABIDING BY THE STATE HOME ORDERS I'D YOU KNOW I JUST. REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN UNDER NUTRITION PROGRAM AND- REALLY WANT TO JUST EMPHASIZE AND HIGHLIGHT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO. AT MINIMUM BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT THE FUNDING LEVELS THAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT IF POSSIBLE EXPAND. SO JUST WANTED A STORY REITERATE THAT IN AND THE NEED FOR IT. COMING FROM THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES ABOUT PROPOSED CUTS TO SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS. YES CORRECT. OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT ATKIN JOHNSONDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THERE'S NO AFTER POSE REJECTION TO THAT THE PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTERS AND TRACKS THE FOOD BANK SUPPORTS THAT'S PARTICULARLY WE HAVE A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AFTER POST YOUR KNEE REVISION FROM THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS. PROPOSED IN JANUARY FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR AT SPECIFIC REDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM I DEFER. MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT BEIJING. OKAY THAT WAS JUST MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. UNDER THE NEW MAY REVISION PROPOSALS THAT THERE WOULD BE REDUCTIONS AND TRICIA PROGRAM SO THEY'RE TEACHING. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING. IF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY. SO I THINK A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED TO SOME THE COMMENTS FROM LA- SO IF- CERTAINLY WITH CAL OR WITH THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION WITH CONNIE'S PERHAPS MAYBE SOME COUNTIES WANT TO TRY TO MOVE AHEAD GIVEN THE PROGRESS% WE'VE MADE TO DATE OTHER COUNTIES MAY SAY I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SAYING LIKE THIS IS NOT THE YEAR TO DO IT BECAUSE- WE'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE OF IT- SO IS. THERE BEEN SOME CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF CAL OR WHETHER IT'S- IN TERMS OF. WORKING WITH COUNTIES AND SEEING WHICH COUNTIES MIGHT STILL BECAUSE THEY'VE- GIVEN WHERE THEY ARE MIGHT WANNA STILL CONTINUE WITH WITH THAT SO ARE YOU ARE YOU JUST LOOKING AT A BLANKET- SUSPENSION FOR- FOR THE COMING YEAR. AND ACTION MAYBE CAN TOUCH ON WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO START MOVING FORWARD AGAIN. SURE CAN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SO THE- PROPOSED OUT LANGUAGE HERE WITH THE REJECTION OF THAT. FINES WOULD STILL ALLOW AS YOU HAVE OUTLINED CHAIR AT THE ABILITY FOR COUNTIES TO CONTINUE. ARE THERE ARE CERTAINLY CERTAIN MEASURES AND METRICS ARE. CAN I PROVIDE AND CONTINUE TO POST PUBLICLY AND WORK WITH COUNTIES DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EFFORTS WITH THE CHARACTER. THAT WOULD CONTINUE FOR THE OPTION WOULD REMAIN JUST RECORDS ACTUALLY SHE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD AND PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL DAY THAT THE SELF ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN. AT TWO FORTY THREE THANK YOU. OKAY WE SHOULD THAT. THE OTHER COMMON I GUESS WAS SAY I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH- ELYAS ASSESSMENT THAT. MY GUESS MMHM MY GUESTS ALSO GUESS- IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME FAIRLY. A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE WORK FORCE EVEN WHEN THE ECONOMY COMES BACK SO I THINK IT'S POINTED OUT THE PREY LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY IS BY NOT GOING TO COVER AS QUICKLY AS IT THE OTHER SECTORS AND- WOMEN ASSISTANCE IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK. IT'S GONNA BECOME VERY IMPORTANT TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. SO NOW ON ON THE FLIP SIDE A GUEST- I GUESS MY HOPES THAT WE HOPE WILL GET FEDERAL FUNDING AS PERHAPS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT GIVEN THAT STRAP PRIEST PAST TRACK RECORD BUT- DO. AGREE WITH LA- THAT- WE- SHOULD LOOK TOWARD L. GIVEN SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM- IN THE PAST IN THE PAST- THAT WE SHOULD CERTAINLY LOOK TO- TRY TO FIND A WAY TO FIND THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES I THINK TO YOU LET'S SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO END UP ON CAL WORKS WHO. MAY HAVE HAD PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE BUT- IN DIFFERENT FIELDS AND- WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HELP THEM- IF WE CAN GET THEM RE EMPLOYED AN OFF COLOR WORKS AGAIN- IN BEING RETRAINED- FOR OTHER TYPES OF WORK COME NOT SURE THEY CAN JUST GO BACK TO THE SAME FIELD. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO- FOR HELP FUND FUND- THAT EMPLOYMENT- THERE'S A FOOT DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH- PROVIDING THE EMPLOYMENT- SUBSIDIES. OR ASSISTANCE. RIGHT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY ANNEX ANY OTHER QUESTION MEMBER QUESTIONS RELATED TO ANY OTHER ITEMS ON OUR BOAT ONLY CALENDAR.
