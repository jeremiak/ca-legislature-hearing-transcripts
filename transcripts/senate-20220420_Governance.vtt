COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:58.897
TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE- THE

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.365
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO

COVERT NINETEEN PET PANDEMIC.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:09.741
MANY FAMILIES HAVE LOST LOVED

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:13.545
ONES. AND IF YOU ARE A CHILD WHO

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:21.019
LOST. AT THE END OF DECEMBER OF

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:21.920
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ESTIMATION

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:24.456
OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT TWENTY

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:25.857
SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN LOST A

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.626
PARENT OR PRIMARY CARE GIVER TO

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.895
COPE IT AND THE MAJORITY OF

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:31.997
THESE WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.732
DATA BUT THE MAJORITY WE KNOW

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.969
OUR LOW THE PARENTS WERE LOW

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.971
WAGE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. SO THESE

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:41.139
ARE CHILDREN WHO IN SOME CASES

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.908
WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL SURVIVOR

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.509
BENEFITS UNDER THE SOCIAL

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.745
SECURITY. ACT IF YOU HAVE A

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.814
CERTAIN NUMBER IF YOU HAVE A

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.016
WAGES THAT WERE QUALIFYING. THEN

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.852
YOUR- YOUR SURVIVORS RECEIVE

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.854
THOSE BENEFITS BUT IN MANY CASES

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.589
A LOT OF THESE CHILDREN WILL NOT

00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:58.957
RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS BECAUSE

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.125
EITHER THEIR PARENTS DIDN'T

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.561
WORK. IN A THE YPE OF WAGE DROP

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.262
THE CONTRIBUTED TO THAT WERE DID

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.597
NOT HAVE ENOUGH QUARTERS OF

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:07.699
THOSE WAGES. BUT ADDITIONALLY

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.335
THESE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HIT

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.137
EIGHTEEN AND NOT HAVE PARENTS TO

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:14.439
RELY ON SO WHILE MANY OF US

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:15.907
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE PARENTS

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:17.009
THAT CAN SUPPORT US BEYOND

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:18.810
EIGHTEEN. MANY OF US FOR AT

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:20.846
LEAST IN THE SITUATION WHERE A

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.748
PARENT COULD HELP US EITHER HELP

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.216
US WITH OUR FIRST AND LAST

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:26.051
MONTH'S RENT. OR YOU KNOW

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.686
COLLEGE YOUR PURCHASE A CAR OR

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.388
WHAT HAVE YOU THESE ARE CHILDREN

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:32.290
WHO WILL NOT. SO ARE WHAT THIS

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:33.892
BILL WOULD DO IS ESTABLISH HOPE

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.794
SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR THOSE

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.896
CHILDREN. WITH A DEPOSIT OF

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.464
POTENTIALLY UP TO FOUR K. FOR

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.133
CHILDREN WHO ARE UP TO NINE

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.301
YEARS OLD. AND UP TO EIGHT K.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:45.137
FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN TEN AND

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:46.371
SEVENTEEN THE THEORY BEING THAT

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:47.372
LASTS FOR THE CHILDREN WERE

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.141
YOUNGER BECAUSE THESE WOULD BE

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:50.776
PUT IN INTEREST BEARING ACCOUNTS

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.311
AND IT WOULD GAIN VALUE OVER

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.379
TIME. BUT ADDITIONALLY THESE

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.747
HOPE SAVINGS ACCOUNT WOULD BE

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.683
SET UP FOR CHILDREN OF LONG WHO

00:21:57.749 --> 00:21:59.985
ARE IN LONG TERM FOSTER CARE ON

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.553
THE SAME THEORY THAT THEY ALSO

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.789
DO NOT HAVE. FAMILIES TO RELY

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.724
ON. AND RESEARCH ACROSS THE

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:08.093
COUNTRY SHOWS THAT. CHILDREN WHO

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.228
KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME SECURITY

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.030
FOR THEM WHEN THEY HIT THAT

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.299
INDEPENDENCE AGE. YOU MUCH

QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICES OF

EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SO I

EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS MORE

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.475
THAN ONCE. WHICH RESULTED IN

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.210
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. I FIRST

TWENTY THREE. OR LATER MY

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.160
OF THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES I

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.929

PROVIDED THROUGH SB EIGHT FIVE

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.036
FOUR WOULD HAVE PREVENTED ME

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.738
FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND IN

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:27.339
SOME CASES THE TRAUMATIC

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.474
EXPERIENCES I SUFFERED THAT

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.143

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.129
IN THE WEEKS TO COME WE'RE ALSO

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:53.964
WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.732
ON THIS BILL WE'RE WORKING WITH

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.601
THE OTHER UTILITIES IN I WANT TO

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.569
BE VERY CLEAR NOT EVERY A

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:00.704
LEXICAL UTILITY IS CREATED

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:03.506
EQUAL. S. G. G. S. D. GENIE IN

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:06.443
THE SAN DIEGO REGION HAS BEEN A

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:08.144
LEADER IN THE WEST IN

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:08.778
UNDERGROUND IN THEIR LINES SO I

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:11.047
DON'T WANT. BLANKET OVER ALL

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.983
UTILITIES BUT JUST BEING CANDID

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:16.620
PG&amp;E MUST DO BETTER. WE'VE ALSO

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:18.421
BEEN MEETING WITH TELECOM I TO

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:19.723
BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEIR

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:22.325
CONCERNS AND I'D LIKE TO TALK

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:23.627
ABOUT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:24.828
THAT WERE TAKEN FROM THE ENERGY

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.196
COMMITTEE. HERE IN GOVERNANCE

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:28.632
AND FINANCE TODAY. THE NUMBER%

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.066
ONE THERE ARE WIRELESS AND THEN

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.468
MEANS TODAY. TO THE LIMITS ARE

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:32.936
GONNA CLARIFIED THAT EXISTING

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.871
MICRO CELL SITES THAT ARE UP ON.

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.339
UTILITY POLES THEY DON'T HAVE TO

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.475
BE. PUT UNDERGROUND OBVIOUSLY

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.310
THAT WOULD NEVER WORK. NUMBER

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:43.113
TWO- WE ARE MAY BE MUCH MORE

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.715
STRATEGIC IN REGARDS TO WHICH-

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.917
HOLES IN LINES WOULD HAVE TO GO

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:49.653
UNDERGROUND. IT IS GOING TO BE

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:50.954
BASED OFF OF HOW. HIGHER RISK

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.256
AREAS ARE. IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:56.259
MANAGEMENT PLANS. I'M IN

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:57.861
ADDITION TO THE OTHER AMENDMENTS

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.796
. WE'RE GOING TO A REQUIRE

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:03.800
ELECTRIC- INDEPENDENT. L. I EAT

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.101
ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:06.336
CONTINUOUSLY DEMONSTRATE A

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:07.837
REASONABLE EFFORT TO EXHAUST ANY

00:55:07.904 --> 00:55:09.372
FEDERAL STATE AND OTHER FUNDING

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:10.974
BEFORE SEEKING RECOVERY FROM

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.809
RATEPAYERS. AND IT ALSO IS GONNA

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:14.644
REQUIRED CPC TO CONSIDER THE

00:55:14.711 --> 00:55:16.079
RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.814
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES WHEN

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:20.650
APPROVING APPLICATIONS FOR

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:21.084
UNDERGROUNDING TRICK

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.419
INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LAST THING

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:26.256
I'M GONNA SAY. IS THIS. IN THE

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:28.224
PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HI WE HEARD

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.761
FROM. SOME TELECONFERENCE IN IT

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.197
IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO RAISE

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:35.965
THE COST OF BROADBAND IN THE

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.200
STATE. AND I GOTTA TELL YA I'M

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.269
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT BROADBAND

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.538
BECAUSE WHERE I LIVE. IT'S THE

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.940
MOST UNSERVED UNDERSERVED REGION

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.009
IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MOST

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:46.676
UNDERSERVED REGIONS IN THE

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:48.478
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:50.313
THERE WAS AN IMPLICATION THROUGH

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.316
THE WORD SET- IT'S GONNA MAKE

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:55.285
THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND MORE

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:58.321
EXPENSIVE IN THE STATE. THERE

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:00.056
COULDN'T BE A MORE DISINGENUOUS

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.491
ARGUMENT AND I DON'T NEED TO GET

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.493
FIRED UP ABOUT THIS BUT IT WAS

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.295
REALLY UPSETTING TO ME BECAUSE I

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.363
WANT TO BE CANDID. THIS STATE IS

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.565
HAVING TO SPEND SIX BILLION

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:11.735
DOLLARS. SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TO

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:14.104
DEPLOY BROADBAND TO UNSERVED AND

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:16.106
UNDERSERVED URBAN COMMUNITIES.

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:19.275
BECAUSE INCUMBENTS. INCUMBENT

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:22.712
TELECOM WON'T SERVE THEM. AND

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:23.646
THEY HAVEN'T SERVE THEM FOR

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:26.683
YEARS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:27.884
THEM NOW THEY'RE NOT GONNA SERVE

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.552
LATER. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.554
THESE LINES THE TEN THOUSAND

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:32.889
MILES A LINES. ARE GOING TO BE

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.191
BURIED IN SOME OF THE MOST RURAL

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:36.960
PARTS OF THE STATE. WHERE THESE

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:38.828
INCUMBENTS WILL NEVER INVEST. OF

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:41.431
THE DOESN'T MAKE BUSINESS SENSE

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.632
BUT THE STATE WELL WITH OUR SIX

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.701
BILLION DOLLARS. SO I JUST WANT

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.070
TO SAY. THAT ARGUMENT IS A BIT

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.539
HOGWASH- AND I WANTED TO ADDRESS

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:50.740
THAT BECAUSE IT WAS SO

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.609
DISINGENUOUS WHEN I HEARD THAT

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:54.144
IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. AND

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.345
AGAIN I DON'T NEED TO BE FIRED

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.347
UP ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS QUITE

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:58.448
FRUSTRATING THE LAST THING YOU

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.517
SAY IS THIS. WE'VE TAKEN UP A

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.652
LOT OF BIG BILLS OVER THE LAST

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.888
SEVERAL YEARS ON UTILITIES AND

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.990
TELECOMMUNICATIONS. EVERY BILL

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:08.958
WE HAVE WORKED ON TOGETHER WE'VE

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:10.727
BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL. THAT

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.895
HAVE MADE OUR STATE MORE SAFE

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:12.996
AND ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.298
INDUSTRY. WE HAD SB SIX SEVENTY.

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:16.599
THAT RELATED TO POWER OUTAGE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.301
REPORTING FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.270
NINETEEN WE HAD SB THREE FORTY

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.471
ONE. RELATED OUTAGES IN BACKUP

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.239
POWER FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:25.241
BOTH OF WHICH STARTED WITH

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.609
SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY OPPOSITION

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:27.744
AND WE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:29.946
THROUGH THE- AS A SESSION MOVED

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:31.714
ON. WE AND I KNOW THAT EIGHT

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:33.683
EIGHT FOUR IS STILL A WORK IN

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:34.517
PROGRESS. BUT YOU HAVE MY

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.485
COMMITMENT WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:36.653
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE BILL

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.688
WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND YES

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:39.789
WE MAY HAVE DISAGREEMENTS IN

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:41.224
COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT MY HOPE. MY

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.792
HOPE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:45.695
THIS RESOLVED. I WANT TO BE

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.430
HONEST. THE WEST UNITED STATES

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:50.767
IS ONLY GETTING HOTTER AND DRIER

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:51.601
. IN THE THREAD A WILDFIRE IS

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:53.136
ONLY GETTING WORSE EVERYONE

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:54.904
KNOWS THAT THE ONLY PATH

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.840
FORWARD. IS FOR ELECTRIC

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.341
UTILITIES SPEED UP THE PACE OF

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.343
MOVING POWER LINES UNDERGROUND

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.245
LIVES ARE LITERALLY AT RISK NOW

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:04.714
BE HONORED TO BE A TO WORK WITH

THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE THE

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:08.885
PACE OF MOVING POWER LINES ARE

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.954
BROWN. AND WITH ME TODAY I'VE

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.588
TERRY MCHALE REPRESENTING THE

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.723
WOMEN A MAN OF CALIFORNICA

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.124
TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE I

AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:19.429
SECURE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

MISTER CHAIRMAN. BANDURAS SO

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:28.271
THIS BILL IS SO LONG OVERDUE

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.139
THOMAS EDISON WHO KNEW A FEW

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.809
THINGS ABOUT ELECTRICITY- WHEN

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.811
HE FIRST FIGURED OUT WHAT HE WAS

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.579
HARVESTING ALSO DECIDED HE

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.215
NEEDED TO. UNDERSTAND THAT A-

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:42.552
SURE THAT WAS INHERENT AND IN

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:44.387
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED AND

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.255
FORTY YEARS AGO. IN MENLO PARK

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.758
NEW JERSEY THOMAS EDISON HAD

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.894
UNDERGROUND CONVEYANCE OF

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.329
ELECTRICAL POWER. HERE IN THE

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:54.864
STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY

00:58:54.931 --> 00:58:55.465
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT WE'VE

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:57.467
BEEN DOING INSTEAD IS AFTER

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.202
EVERY MAJOR EMERGENCY WE HAVE A

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.571
STUDY. IN THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.406
YEARS HAVE BEEN TEN OR TWELVE

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:05.775
MAJOR STUDIES DEALING WITH THE

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:08.378
EFFICACY IN THE NEED FOR THIS

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.480
UNDERGROUND CONVEYANCE. THE

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.382
PROBLEM IS IN THE LAST FIVE

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:14.317
YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.685
HERE. IS THAT IN THE LAST FIVE

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:18.521
YEARS WELL WE'VE BEEN FIDDLING

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:19.856
AND NERO COULD HAVE BEEN

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:20.990
HANDLING THIS PUBLIC POLICY

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.458
BETTER THAN WHAT'S BEEN DONE

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.727
NOW. WELL WE'VE BEEN BERNIE. THE

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:26.696
FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.665
DEAL WITH THE WITH THE MOST

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:31.167
DANGEROUS AND HISTORIC FIRES IN

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.503
OUR HISTORY. IN THE LAST FIVE IN

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:35.705
SIX YEARS WE HAVE NOT SEEN JUST

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:38.074
FIRES WE'VE SEEN MEGA FIRES. WE

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:39.142
SEE AN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:41.311
DESTROYED WE'VE SEEN BUSINESSES

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:44.547
LOST WE'VE SEN LIVES LOST. AND

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:48.184
MR MISTER WINNER. WE KNOW HOW

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.720
THESE FIRES ARE STARTED WE KNOW

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:53.389
WHO'S CAUSING THEM AND WE KNOW

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:54.791
THAT ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.492
GO UNDERGROUND AND I THINK

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.194
THAT'S THE ESSENCE IN THE BASIS

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.729
OF WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER IS

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.965
DOING TODAY. I WOULD SAY WHERE

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.266
THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT THIS

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:06.069
IS A UTILITY PROBLEM THIS IS NOT

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.037
A. TELECOM PROBLEM. THE TELECOM

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.139
PEOPLE HAVE NOT CREATED THE

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:12.342
DANGER TO THE FIREFIGHTERS. AND

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:13.810
I'M HOPING AND I'M PLEASED TO

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.778
HEAR THE SENATOR TALKED THAT

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.380
THERE WILL BE MORE DISCUSSION IN

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.682
THAT REGARD. BUT IT IS LONG

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.017
OVERDUE THE CENTER HAS ALSO

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.285
MENTIONED THAT THE HISTORIC

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:24.220
FIRES THE LAST FIVE YEARS. ARE

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:26.656
GOING TO BE WORSE THIS YEAR. YOU

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.058
KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE. THE WINTER

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.760
RAIN WE HAVEN'T HAD THE SNOW.

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:34.263
WE'RE SEEN THE PROBLEMS OF

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.066
CLIMATE CHANGE AND OF COURSE END

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.501

RELIABILITY OF SERVICE WHETHER

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.180
IT'S ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.849
MANY AREAS THAT IS NOT GOING TO

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:23.185
BE FEASIBLE AS WELL AS I SAID

AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO GO

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.139
UNDERGROUND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.573
THE CUMULATIVE TOTAL THIS IS

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.208
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE DON'T

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:49.545

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.915
THROUGH THEIR RATE. POTENTIALLY

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:53.883

RECOVER THEIR COSTS. BY GOING TO

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.677
THAT LAST MILE- SO DID THE

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.512

DYNAMIC WE DN'T KNOW HOW MANY

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.788
OF THOSE GRANTS WOULD BE IN

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.057
THESE HIGH FIRE AREAS. BUT I

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.992

IT'S GOING TO COST TEN TIMES

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.097
MORE. IN USING THE MONEY THAT

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.433

AND THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW SEND YOU

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.041
COUNTY IS- COUNTY WITH UP I

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.209
THINK IT'S APPROXIMATELY

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:37.777
EIGHTEEN CITIES IF MY

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:40.012
RECOLLECTION SERVES ME WELL AND

01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.881
REMEMBER MY VERY SMALL SOME OF-

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:44.484
ARE LOCATED IN DIFFERENT PARTS

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:47.220
OF THE COUNTY AND SO OFTEN TIMES

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:48.955
YOU HAVE SOME CITIES THAT ARE

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:50.289
DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:50.923
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE OTHERS

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:53.593
ARE NOT. AND SOME CITIES ARE

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:55.161
VERY LARGE EMPLOYMENT CENTERS

01:58:55.228 --> 01:58:57.063
WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT AND THAT

01:58:57.129 --> 01:58:58.764
OFTEN CREATES AN IMBALANCE THAT

01:58:58.831 --> 01:59:00.399
THAT CREATES GRIDLOCK AND

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.435
TRAFFIC AND SO WHEN WE BUILD

01:59:02.502 --> 01:59:04.136
HIGHWAYS AND SAID HE WILL COUNTY

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:06.239
IT'S KIND OF A PROCESS BY WHICH

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:09.342
WE WORK WITH THE CALTRANS SANDAG

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:10.877
AND THE LOCAL CITIES EACH CITY

01:59:10.943 --> 01:59:13.279
GETS AN ALLOCATION OF FOR BASED

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:17.083
ON THEIR NEEDS. AND SO I THINK

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:20.820
THE IDEA BEHIND OUR PLANNING

01:59:20.887 --> 01:59:24.524
EFFORT IS YOU WANT TO. UP A-

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:26.659
TARGET BUILDING HOUSING MOSTLY

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:29.095
WHERE YOU NEED IT. AND LOCAL

01:59:29.161 --> 01:59:29.929
GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO DO

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:34.000
THAT AND SO ONE CENTRAL AGENCY

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:35.635
CAN OFTENTIMES TO A BETTER JOB

01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:37.637
AT. A DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL AND

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:39.805
STATE FUNDS AND THEY CAN HELP

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:41.774
WORK WITH CITIES TO HELP THEM

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.643
MEET. THEIR THEIR NEEDS BUT IT'S

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:45.678
ALSO GOING TO BE DONE BASED ON

01:59:45.745 --> 01:59:48.814
ON ON DEMAND. AND I THINK THAT'S

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:51.984
OF THAT MODEL ESPECIALLY FOR

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:53.085
SENEGAL COUNTY IS VERY VERY

01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:56.789
pTHE SUPERVISOR SAID WE'VE

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:58.658
ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:00.893
FOR MANY YEARS NOW. HOW DO HOW

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:03.829

02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:11.604
SPRAWL SPRAWL- WILL- BASICALLY

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.673
TOKO TAKEOVER ARE SMALL FARMS IN

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.641
OUR AGRICULTURAL AREAS I THINK

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:17.710
IN SAN DIEGO WE DON'T WANT THAT

02:00:17.777 --> 02:00:19.512

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:30.523

SINGLE BUDGET REQUEST BY C.

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:15.400

02:11:15.467 --> 02:11:17.803
EXTENT UC'S AS THE RELEVANT- FOR

02:11:17.869 --> 02:11:20.606
THAT VERY PURPOSE. THIS IS PART

02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:21.707
OF THE CALIFORNIANS PARTY

02:11:21.773 --> 02:11:23.675
AMERICAN EXPERIENCE THAT WE

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:25.911

OF THEIR ABILITY- TO PAY AT THAT

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:30.415
THAT IS FALLING SHORT IN MANY

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:31.817
RESPECTS SO. I ACTUALLY

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.920
EMPATHIZE- BUT I THINK IT'S A

02:11:34.987 --> 02:11:36.421
MATTER OF POLICY IN A MATTER OF

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:37.723
LEGISLATION. THOSE ISSUES ARE

02:11:37.789 --> 02:11:39.591
PROBABLY BEST DEALT WITH ON A

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:42.394
NEEDS BASED ASSESSMENT THROUGH

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:44.196
THE CAL STATE FARM- GRANT

STATE GRANT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:52.204
FEDERAL. BUT I AM ALWAYS

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.905
SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE AS WELL. AND

02:11:53.972 --> 02:11:54.539
YET AGAIN YOU THE SAN NOTED THE

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:56.875
IS AN CAP IN THE BILL'S FOLK ARE

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:57.843
MAKING FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:11:57.909 --> 02:11:59.411
DOLLARS ARE WEALTHIER FOLKS

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:00.746
POTENTIALLY WON'T GET THIS TAX

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:01.613
INCENTIVE ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.149
A LOT OF THEM HAVE FOUR OH ONE

02:12:04.216 --> 02:12:05.651
K.'S ARE SAVING OUTSIDE OF FIVE

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:06.585
TO NINE PLANS. WE FOUND FIVE TO

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.520
NINE PLANS ARE PRIMARILY BEING

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:10.122
USED BY THE MIDDLE INCOME OR

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:10.989
TRYING TO FACILITATE LOWER

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:12.057
INCOME INDIVIDUALS ENTERING THE

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.959
FOLD AS WELL AS A REFERENCE MORE

02:12:14.026 --> 02:12:14.660
ACCOUNT OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:12:14.726 --> 02:12:16.828
CAN GROW OUR MATCHING GRANT

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:18.263
PROGRAM IS TO SERVE THOSE FOLKS

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:18.897
THAT MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:20.532
DOLLARS. OR LESS BYE WE MATCH

02:12:20.599 --> 02:12:21.800
THEM DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WE CAN

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.402
GROW THAT PROGRAM WITH MORE

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:24.903
MONEY COMING INTO THE COFFERS

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.305
FOR OUR FIVE TO NINETEEN GROW

02:12:26.371 --> 02:12:27.606
OUR STATE PROGRAMS. BUT I ALSO

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:29.408
WANT TO NOTE- JUST MEMBER NATION

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:30.742
WE FOUND THAT IT'S A COMMON

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:31.943
MISCONCEPTION THAT THESE ARE

02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:33.512
USED BY HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:35.047
THE NORMAL- THE AVERAGE ACCOUNT

02:12:35.113 --> 02:12:37.516
BALANCE IS TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN

02:12:37.582 --> 02:12:38.784
HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS SO

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:40.185
THAT REALLY GROWS FROM PEOPLE

02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:41.053
PUTTING A FEW HUNDRED ASIDE WHEN

02:12:41.119 --> 02:12:42.521
THEY CAN'T MAYBE A THOUSAND. BUT

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:43.755
WE DO KNOW THAT MIDDLE AMERICA

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:46.124
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WERE HIT

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:46.792
REALLY HARD THE PANDEMIC AND ARE

02:12:46.858 --> 02:12:48.794
NOT A LOT FOR THEM TO UTILIZE

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.262
RIGHT NOW AS WELL. AND ALSO

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:51.697
BASED ON A TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:12:51.763 --> 02:12:52.764
SURVEY WE CONDUCTED BY THE

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:53.932
INDUSTRY RESEARCH PROVIDED BY

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:56.168
STRATEGIC INSIGHT. CSF DID

02:12:56.234 --> 02:12:58.003
PROVIDE US MORE INFORMATION- AND

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.237
WE FOUND DATA FROM ITS

02:12:59.304 --> 02:13:01.073
MEMBERSHIP SHOWING 70% OF THE

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:03.208
MORE THAN TWELVE POINT SIX

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.277
MILLION FIVE TO NINE PLAN

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:06.211
ACCOUNT HOLDERS NATIONWIDE HAVE

02:13:06.278 --> 02:13:07.579
INCOMES UNDER A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:09.348
THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT IS

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:10.582
UNDER THE CAP THAT SET IN THIS

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.351
BILL AND THAT'S GENERALLY WHO WE

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:14.119
FIND UTILIZING THIS PROGRAM. SO

02:13:14.186 --> 02:13:15.153
WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.221
ARE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS OUT

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:18.623
THERE THIS REALLY IS GEARED

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:19.991
TOWARD HELPING OUR FAMILY SAFE

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:22.027
AND IF WE CAN INCENTIVIZE THEM

02:13:22.094 --> 02:13:23.495
TO PUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.364
HUNDRED DOLLARS A THOUSAND

02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:26.898
DOLLARS SIDE- IT'S REALLY TO

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:27.799
GROW THOSE STUDENTS AND THAT'S

02:13:27.866 --> 02:13:29.434
WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. BUT WE'RE

02:13:29.501 --> 02:13:30.469
ALWAYS WILLING TO CONTINUE THESE

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:31.603

CHALLENGES WITH DECARBONIZATION-

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:13.623
CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING BUILDINGS

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:15.892
BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:42:15.959 --> 02:42:17.627

02:42:17.694 --> 02:42:21.098
BEFORE APPROVING ORDINANCES THAT

02:43:45.448 --> 02:43:47.217
ALLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GO

ALWAYS BEEN LOCAL CONTROL

03:40:45.699 --> 03:40:46.800
CONTROL BUT THIS SEEMS TO ME TO

03:40:46.866 --> 03:40:49.536
BE- A LITTLE OVER THE TOP IF YOU

03:40:49.603 --> 03:40:50.604

APPRECIATE THE QUESTION THE

03:41:07.687 --> 03:41:09.556
OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY WHAT WE

03:41:09.623 --> 03:41:11.291
DID IS WE LOOKED AT- STARTED

03:41:11.358 --> 03:41:12.626
WITH THE COUNTY TO LOOK AT WHICH

03:41:12.692 --> 03:41:14.594
OF THEM- OPTED INTO THE

03:41:19.265 --> 03:41:20.634
LOOK TO SEE IF THEY HAD CITIES

INTO THE REGULATED FRAMEWORK

03:41:30.510 --> 03:41:33.046

03:42:14.988 --> 03:42:16.089
HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THE NUMBER

03:42:16.156 --> 03:42:17.524
I DON'T KNOW IT JUST. SEEMS TO

03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:19.726
ME IT'S KIND OF A-A NOT REALLY

03:42:19.793 --> 03:42:20.860
ACCURATE BECAUSE YOU DON'T YOU

03:42:20.927 --> 03:42:23.163
MIGHT BE THE COUNTY. YOU MIGHT

03:42:23.229 --> 03:42:23.897
ALPINE COUNTY HAS NO CITIES

03:42:23.963 --> 03:42:26.633
RIGHT. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DRIVE

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.234
EIGHTY MILES TO GO SOMEPLACE

03:42:28.301 --> 03:42:29.936
ELSE DID YOU DO THAT DIAGNOSTIC

03:42:30.003 --> 03:42:31.471
IN TERMS OF. PATIENT CONVENIENCE

03:42:31.538 --> 03:42:33.473
AND A LIKE A LIKE TO GET SOME

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:34.941
SENSE OF THAT BECAUSE- THE FACT

03:42:35.008 --> 03:42:36.743
THAT YOU GOT THROUGH IN THIRTY

03:42:36.810 --> 03:42:38.878
CITIES AND- IN. CALIFORNIA DON'T

03:42:38.945 --> 03:42:40.947
ALLOW ACCESS TO SOME OF THE

03:42:41.014 --> 03:42:42.015
VOTERS PASSED. FOR MEDICINE IS A

03:42:42.082 --> 03:42:43.483
PRETTY BIG DEAL THAT HAT'S AN

03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:44.951
INTERESTING COMMENT AND ACTUALLY

03:42:45.018 --> 03:42:46.686
SPEAKS TO A LARGER ISSUE OF AND

03:42:46.753 --> 03:42:48.188
RULE CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU USED

03:42:48.254 --> 03:42:49.389
TO DRIVING FOR. ANY SERVICES

03:42:49.456 --> 03:42:50.423
WHETHER IT'S TRADITIONAL MEDICAL

03:42:50.490 --> 03:42:52.492
SERVICES YOUR GROCERIES YOUR GAS

03:42:52.559 --> 03:42:54.227
EXCEPT TRACK. BUT ACTUALLY THAT

03:42:54.294 --> 03:42:55.995
A LARGE PROPORTION OF REAL

03:42:56.062 --> 03:42:58.064
CITIES OUR WORLD COUNTIES OFTEN.

03:42:58.131 --> 03:42:59.566
TO PROVIDING FOR A WHOLE ENTIRE

03:42:59.632 --> 03:43:01.134
REGULATORY SCHEME. AND ACTUALLY

03:43:01.201 --> 03:43:03.136
IN SOME CASES THEY ALLOW A LOT

03:43:03.203 --> 03:43:05.138
OF THINGS LIKE CULTIVATION

03:43:05.205 --> 03:43:13.379
MANUFACTURING PROCESSING. BUTTON. RETAILS ARE PART. BECAUSE I'M

03:43:13.446 --> 03:43:14.981
NOT. THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES IT

03:43:15.048 --> 03:43:15.915
LIMITS. COMMERCIAL LEARN. AND

03:43:15.982 --> 03:43:16.750
THEN YOU'LL SEE SEIZE WITHIN

03:43:16.816 --> 03:43:18.852
THOSE. PICK UP RETAIL BUT NOT A

03:43:18.918 --> 03:43:20.787
- THE COLD. SO I THINK IN TERMS

03:43:20.854 --> 03:43:22.455
OF AN OUTSIDE A LOCAL BIT THE-

03:43:22.522 --> 03:43:24.491
IN RULE CAN YOU. IN INTO CAN AND

03:43:24.557 --> 03:43:25.692
WE HAVE A FEW COUNTIES THAT.

03:43:25.759 --> 03:43:27.660
DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAT WOULD

03:43:27.727 --> 03:43:28.628
THIS WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT

03:43:28.695 --> 03:43:29.863
LIKE ALPINE WHICH IS THIRTEEN

03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:30.764
HUNDRD PEOPLE MOST OF PEOPLE

03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:32.966
ARE HEADING TO ELDORADO OR AND

03:43:33.032 --> 03:43:34.400
THEN BRING COUNTY TO. GET THEIR

03:43:34.467 --> 03:43:35.702
NORMAL SERVICES INCLUDING.

03:43:35.769 --> 03:43:37.303
POTENTIALLY THE MEDICAL CANNABIS

03:43:37.370 --> 03:43:38.905
WE ALSO HAVE THERE WAS ANOTHER

03:43:38.972 --> 03:43:41.007
COUNTY WHICH IS MAROPOST AGAIN

03:43:41.074 --> 03:43:43.943
HAS NO CITY- AND SO IT'S IT WILL

03:43:44.010 --> 03:43:45.979
BE CHALLENGING FOR THEM. TO HAVE

03:43:46.045 --> 03:43:47.981
ESSENTIALLY ORDINANCES FOR.

03:43:48.047 --> 03:43:49.749
RETAIL AND FRANKLY THERE WILL BE

03:43:49.816 --> 03:43:51.484
NO READ THAT GOES INTO IT

03:43:51.551 --> 03:43:52.786
BECAUSE- I MEAN THEY'RE NOT EVEN

03:43:52.852 --> 03:43:54.854
GETTING. BASIC SERVICES WITHIN

03:43:54.921 --> 03:43:55.889
THEIR COUNTY A LOT OF TIME

03:43:55.955 --> 03:43:57.791
SURPRISE HAD ONE MORE QUESTION-

03:43:57.857 --> 03:43:59.159
IT DOESN'T LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

03:43:59.225 --> 03:44:00.693
IN THE- MEDICINES WHICH

03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:03.363
SHOULDN'T YOU IF YOU GET. IT IS

03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.997
A THINKING ON THAT. SHOULDN'T

03:44:04.063 --> 03:44:05.732
YOU LOOK AT THIS IS TAMMY

03:44:05.799 --> 03:44:06.733
PHARMACIES ARE THERE. RIGHT IF

03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:08.768
YOU'RE GONNA GO TRAVEL TO A BIG

03:44:08.835 --> 03:44:09.736
BOX RETAILER SOMETHING BUT

03:44:09.803 --> 03:44:11.738
SHOULD THIS BE IF THIS IS

03:44:11.805 --> 03:44:12.639
MEDICINE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHICH

03:44:12.705 --> 03:44:13.973
ONLY TALKING ABOUT CORRECT SIR.

03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:15.775
SO SHOULDN'T YOU DO LOOK AT

03:44:15.842 --> 03:44:16.709
APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON TO

03:44:16.776 --> 03:44:18.344
SAY OKAY. YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT

03:44:18.411 --> 03:44:19.779
HAVE TO GO VERY FAR FOR THIS

03:44:19.846 --> 03:44:21.548
KIND OF MEDICINE BUT EVERY OTHER

03:44:21.614 --> 03:44:22.549
MEDICINE THAT'S REGULATED BY THE

03:44:22.615 --> 03:44:24.617
BOARD OF PHARMACY. YOU CAN GO

03:44:24.684 --> 03:44:26.486
CLOSER TO THAT SHOULD THAT BE A

03:44:26.553 --> 03:44:28.822
BETTER. ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF

03:44:28.888 --> 03:44:30.523
LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF CENTER

03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:32.992
WE HAS MADE NO I THINK WE'RE

03:44:33.059 --> 03:44:33.459
WILLING TO HAVE THOSE

03:44:33.526 --> 03:44:34.627
CONVERSATIONS I THINK PART OF IT

03:44:34.694 --> 03:44:37.263
IS THE PROMISE DOESN'T REALLY

03:44:37.330 --> 03:44:37.931
HAVE ANYTHING THAT SETS UP. WHAT

03:44:37.997 --> 03:44:39.365
IS ADEQUATE ACCESS WHAT WE NEED

03:44:39.432 --> 03:44:40.900
TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE'RE WILLING

03:44:40.967 --> 03:44:41.868
TO HAVE. THOSE CONVERSATIONS

03:44:41.935 --> 03:44:43.102
MOVING FORWARD DEFINITELY AND I

03:44:43.169 --> 03:44:44.804
WANT TO SAY THAT IS PART OF THE

03:44:44.871 --> 03:44:46.773
REASON THAT WE- FOUGHT SO HARD

03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:48.174
ORIGINALLY FOR LOCAL CONTROL WAS

03:44:48.241 --> 03:44:49.242
MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES.

03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:50.944
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE.

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:52.645
DECISIONS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR

03:44:52.712 --> 03:44:54.113
THEM AND WE'RE GOING THAT THE

03:44:54.180 --> 03:44:55.548
DIFFERENCE IN REAL SUBURBAN AND

03:44:55.615 --> 03:44:57.016
URBAN AND BETWEEN COUNTIES AND

03:44:57.083 --> 03:44:59.385
CITIES. BECAUSE THEY ALSO ARE

03:44:59.452 --> 03:45:06.092
VERY DIFFERENT. SELL. WITH THAT

03:45:06.159 --> 03:45:07.794
AGAIN WE- FOR THE FIRST

03:45:07.861 --> 03:45:08.394
CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT HOW WEAK

03:45:08.461 --> 03:45:10.363
ALL WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE.

03:45:10.430 --> 03:45:12.899
GOOD THANK YOU- AND I THAT IS.

03:45:12.966 --> 03:45:15.969
THAT THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IN

03:45:16.035 --> 03:45:16.569
TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS IS

03:45:16.636 --> 03:45:18.738
THAT- AND I'M A BIG ADVOCATE FOR

03:45:18.805 --> 03:45:20.707
LOCAL CONTROL NO QUESTION ABOUT

03:45:20.773 --> 03:45:24.344
IT BUT- BUT HAVING SAID THAT- I

03:45:24.410 --> 03:45:25.778
THINK THAT THERE'S STILL THE

03:45:25.845 --> 03:45:28.615
RESISTANCE TO CONSIDER MARIJUANA

03:45:28.681 --> 03:45:30.250
- AT A MINIMUM FOR MEDICINAL

03:45:30.316 --> 03:45:32.819
PURPOSES. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:45:32.886 --> 03:45:36.256
THAT CALIFORNIA LAW CHANGED BUT-

03:45:36.322 --> 03:45:38.691
MAYBE THE MINES- ARE HAVING A

03:45:38.758 --> 03:45:40.693
HARD TIME WITH IT STILL WE NEED

03:45:40.760 --> 03:45:42.495
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE-

03:45:42.562 --> 03:45:44.764
THERE ARE MEDICATIONS. THAT ARE

03:45:44.831 --> 03:45:45.965
PRESCRIBED BY DOCTORS THAT ARE

03:45:46.032 --> 03:45:48.735
MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY HARMFUL TO

03:45:48.801 --> 03:45:51.437
INDIVIDUALS- THAT ARE ADDICTIVE

03:45:51.504 --> 03:45:54.207
IN A WAY THAT- THAT LEAVES DEATH

03:45:54.274 --> 03:45:58.111
THAT THAT ARE. AVAILABLE MUCH

03:45:58.177 --> 03:45:59.345
MORE READILY AVAILABLE AND SOME

03:45:59.412 --> 03:46:01.247
OF THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES

03:46:01.314 --> 03:46:04.450
AND OTHERS AND SO MANY CASES- I

03:46:04.517 --> 03:46:06.319
WILL SUPPORT THE BILL- AND I

03:46:06.386 --> 03:46:07.587
HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE THE

03:46:07.654 --> 03:46:09.389
CONVERSATIONS I THINK THE

03:46:09.455 --> 03:46:15.128
AMENDMENTS. REALLY- MOVE. NOBODY

03:46:15.194 --> 03:46:16.796
LIKES TO HEAR YOU GOT TO DO

03:46:16.863 --> 03:46:19.132
SOMETHING BUT IT MOVES IN IN THE

03:46:19.198 --> 03:46:20.033
DIRECTION THAT- THAT I THINK

03:46:20.099 --> 03:46:21.567
WILL BE BETTER FOR CITIES AND

03:46:21.634 --> 03:46:24.304
COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO- TO SET

03:46:24.370 --> 03:46:27.307
THE LIMITS AROUND- AT WHERE

03:46:27.373 --> 03:46:29.776
THINGS CAN BE STORED. TO BE USED

03:46:29.842 --> 03:46:32.879
FOR DELIVERY- BUT- BUT ALSO

03:46:32.946 --> 03:46:34.647
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:46:34.714 --> 03:46:35.682
DELIVERY SERVICE IN THE

03:46:35.748 --> 03:46:37.050
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S

03:46:37.116 --> 03:46:39.385
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IF YOUR ILL

03:46:39.452 --> 03:46:42.322
AND YOU WERE ABILITY TO IT TOO

03:46:42.388 --> 03:46:44.390
TO BE MOBILE IS NOT. NOT THERE

03:46:44.457 --> 03:46:46.459
THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT- TO BE

03:46:46.526 --> 03:46:49.462
ABLE TO GET OUT WHAT IS A ARE A

03:46:49.529 --> 03:46:52.231
RELATIVELY- WELL WHICH I THINK

03:46:52.298 --> 03:46:54.801
IS A REALLY GOOD MEDICATION FOR

03:46:54.867 --> 03:46:56.369
MANY OF THESE VERY SERIOUS

03:46:56.436 --> 03:46:57.904
ILLNESSES. BENJAMIN THE BILL.

03:46:57.971 --> 03:47:00.306
THERE IS A MOTIONS AND HERTZBERG

03:47:00.373 --> 03:47:02.241
YES THIS IS THE- CENTER THE RISE

03:47:02.308 --> 03:47:04.544
OF MAY BE OFF THE WALL KIND OF

03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:09.215
QUESTION BUT HE IS THERE- A BIG

03:47:09.282 --> 03:47:11.451
DIFFERENCE. THE AREA THAT COLD.

03:47:11.517 --> 03:47:13.653
ARE THEY THE SAME ONE THE AREAS

03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:15.989
THAT DON'T SELL IT IS THERE ANY

03:47:16.055 --> 03:47:18.658
KIND OF CONNECTION THERE OR-

03:47:18.725 --> 03:47:20.860
ASSISTING YEAH JUST CURIOUS I

03:47:20.927 --> 03:47:22.595
DON'T- SO IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE

03:47:22.662 --> 03:47:24.130
HUMBOLDT OR MENDOCINO COUNTY

03:47:24.197 --> 03:47:25.865
WHICH IS SOME OF THE BIG

03:47:25.932 --> 03:47:27.934
CULTIVATORS BAY- I THINK- LESS

03:47:28.001 --> 03:47:30.003
OF AN ISSUE- I WILL TELL YOU

03:47:30.069 --> 03:47:32.438
THAT- YOU'RE JUST WHAT WITH

03:47:32.505 --> 03:47:34.507
RECENT WITH RESPECT TO THE TO

03:47:34.574 --> 03:47:38.611
THE OPPOSITION. TO DISABLED 67%

03:47:38.678 --> 03:47:40.680
OF CALIFORNIA IS LIVE IN A

03:47:40.747 --> 03:47:41.381
JURISDICTION THAT ALLOWS US

03:47:41.447 --> 03:47:43.249
WITHOUT A PROBLEM WELL THAT'S OF

03:47:43.316 --> 03:47:45.451
COURSE BECAUSE OUR BIG CITIES

03:47:45.518 --> 03:47:46.886
OUR BIGGEST CITIES TEND TO ALLOW

03:47:46.953 --> 03:47:50.189
THEM LA SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW

03:47:50.256 --> 03:47:54.460
SAN JOSE SEN SO THAT THAT'S IT

03:47:54.527 --> 03:47:55.995
WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY IT'S VERY

03:47:56.062 --> 03:47:57.964
MISLEADING WE HAVE WE ACTUALLY

03:47:58.031 --> 03:48:00.099
ARE HOPING AT SOME POINT SOON

03:48:00.166 --> 03:48:01.834
WE'LL HAVE AN ACCURATE MAP. THAT

03:48:01.901 --> 03:48:04.670
SHOWS THE AND I AM WHAT IT MIGHT

03:48:04.737 --> 03:48:07.140
TAKE IS THAT IT WAS SO MASSIVE
