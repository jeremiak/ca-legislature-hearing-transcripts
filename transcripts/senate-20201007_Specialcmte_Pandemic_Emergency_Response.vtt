PANDEMIC. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:20.359

REASONS. IN TERMS OF OUR WERE

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:29.934
WORKING TOGETHER WE'VE WORKED

TOGETHER ON A NUMBER OF CASES

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:32.636
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.905
WE'VE DONE I DID EARLY ON WAS

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.307
TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE LOCAL

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:38.142
HEALTH OFFICERS IN THE STATE.

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.977
TO LET THEM KNOW THAT- HOW TO

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:42.313
REACH US THIS WAS ALSO PART OF

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:45.683

IF STAY- HAVE PRIORITIES IF

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.058
THERE'S INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.559
WANT TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:56.527
ONE SHARE THEY SHOULD REACH OUT

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.062
TO US ABOUT YOUR WORK PLACES

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.498
THAT THEY FIND PROBLEMATIC. AND

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:02.767
THEN THIS AND HAPPENING- I

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:06.103
THINK THAT IT'S FAIR TO SAY

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.538
SPEND MORE. FOR BEEN MORE AD

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.907
HOC THE SYSTEM. IT BASED ON

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.809
JUST THE PART LOCAL PRIORITIES.

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:14.612
ANALYSTS SAY THAT WITH EIGHTY

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:17.515
SIX EIGHTY FIVE WE THINK THAT.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.116
BRING ON A NEW REQUIREMENT

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:21.152
WHICH IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:23.487
NOTIFY OCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:26.157
OF COKE A CASES REGARDLESS OF

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:26.957
MAKING ANY KIND OF

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:28.959
DETERMINATIONS ABOUT. WHERE

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:30.427
THEY CAME FROM OR WHETHER THEIR

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:32.663
WORK RELATED IS GOING TO BE IN

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.631
A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:37.368
CUTTING DOWN THE- THAT TIME

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.370
LINE THE TIME IT TAKES TO

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.437
EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO AN

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:42.072
INCIDENT WHICH I THINK. KIND OF

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.576
GOES TO THE CORE PROBLEM-

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:48.445
THAT'S SERIALIZER AND IF YOUR

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:52.283
QUESTION. WELL IF I COULD I

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.918
MEAN PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:56.220
I'M I'M HEARING IS THAT- IN

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.521
SOME OF THE BIG INDUSTRIES YOU

00:40:57.588 --> 00:40:59.924
HAVE PEOPLE THAT- PEOPLE THAT

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.826
DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO.

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:02.326
WORK WE'RE GOING TO WORK

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.227
ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY WERE HIGH

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:07.164
RISK FOR WILL BE THERE FOR

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:07.798
BECAUSE OF A MAJOR BECAUSE OF.

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.900
EXIST CONDITIONS AND YOU HAD

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.735
PEOPLE THAT WERE SICK BUT

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:14.471
DIDN'T HAVE COPING GONE AND SO.

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.540
EVEN THE EMPLOYER HAD NO WAY OF

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.008
BEING ABLE TO ASCERTAIN WHY

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:20.411
SOMEBODY WASN'T AT THE OFFICE

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:23.214
OR OR AT THAT LOCATION- AND IN

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.748
PARTICULAR IN SOME OF OUR RURAL

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.685
SETTINGS- THERE THERE THERE CAN

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:31.222
BE A REAL. HEAVY TURNOVER WITH

00:41:31.288 --> 00:41:32.957
CONTRACT LABOR BEING USED AS

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:35.693
THAT AS THE AS THE BACKSTOP AND

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.595
SOME I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:38.729
TO HOW DO YOU SET UP AN

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:41.298
OBLIGATION FOR AN EMPLOYER TO

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:44.368
DO SOMETHING. IF THERE IF. IF

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.504
THERE ARE PROTECTIONS.

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:50.341
PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES THAT

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.342
MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.710
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON UNLESS

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:54.778
THAT EMPLOYEE IS FORTHCOMING.

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.547
AND I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:58.682
THERE'S- YOU KNOW HOW WE SET UP

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:01.552
THE SYSTEM. SO THAT THAT THERE

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:05.356
ARE MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS BETWEEN.

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:09.460
LADIES AND- AND THEN THEN IT

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:10.060
GETS REPORTED CONSISTENTLY TO

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:13.297
THE SAME. TO THE SAME ENTITY

00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:15.299
BECAUSE I ALSO. HEARD AND I

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.101
DIDN'T GET IT DONE QUICKLY AND

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:18.769
BUT THAT THERE IS SOME

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.037
REPORTING THAT HAPPENS TO THE

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.105
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.006
THEN THERE'S OTHER REPORTING

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:24.742
THAT HAPPENED TO THE OFFICE OF

00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:27.378
EMERGENCY SERVICES AND HOW HOW

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:30.314
WOULD. AN INDIVIDUALKNOW WHO

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.649
THEY SHOULD REPORT EITHER AND

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:39.023
ELLIS TWO OR AND DEATH. TO ON.

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:41.158
THIS IS IT HAS SO MANY HOLES IN

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:42.326
IT THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.161
SOME SOME TO FALL THROUGH AND

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:45.362
WE DON'T GET A REAL CLEAR

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.730
PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:49.900
THE COMMUNITY. WELL IT IS TRUE

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.635
THAT- THAT I'M FOR CAN'T REPORT

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:54.038
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT- ONE

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.239
OF THE- WAYS THAT WE'VE

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.441
ADDRESSED THAT IN OUR GUIDANCE.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.109
THAT WE'VE ISSUE WITH C. DPH IS

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:02.012
TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE. WORKERS

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.647
TO REPORT ILLNESSES AND

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:07.051
SYMPTOMS AND ALSO. MAKE SURE

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.886
THAT EMPLOYERS EMPHASIZE THIS

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:10.988
IN TRAINING THAT THEY PROVIDE

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:14.224
TO EMPLOYEES TO SORT OF IMPROVE

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:58.762
OUTBREAK- THAT THE COMPANY

THE PROTECTION SO THAT WE DON'T

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.071
END UP WITH THE PEOPLE DYING

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:15.372
BECAUSE A COMPANY DECIDES THEY

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:16.740
JUST DON'T WANT TO COMPLAIN

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.475

INVESTIGATION THERE AND SO THAT

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.186
PUTS SOME LIMITS ON WHAT I CAN

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:05.422

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:09.059
CAN SAY THAT WE ARE- ACTIVELY

EARLIER COMPLIANCE- IN ORDER TO

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.419
ASSURE THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE

IT OR IF YOU THINK IT WOULD BE

00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:35.806
HELPFUL IN GETTING COMPLIANCE-

PLAINTIFFS TO INDIVIDUALS

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.250
WHO'VE BEEN HARMED I'M LOOKING

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:49.119
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOUR

00:49:49.186 --> 00:49:51.488
INCENTIVES ARE WITCHER-

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:53.890
AUTHORITY IS ERIN AND IF IT IS

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.093
EXPANSIVE ENOUGH. AND WHETHER

OR NOT YOU ALREADY HAVE OR NEED

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:01.298
TO CREATE. MORE ACCESS TO THE

COURTS FOR JUSTICE IF YOU WILL

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.403
BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.604
WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE OF FINE

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.240
WHEN WE IDENTIFY A VIOLATION

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.708
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:15.011
THAT GO INTO THE SIZE OF THE

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:15.979
PENALTY THE MONETARY SIDE OF

00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:18.181
THE PENALTY SO THAT LOOKS SET

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:18.982
TO YOU KNOW NEGLIGENCE THE SIZE

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.817
OF THE COMPANY. WHETHER OR NOT

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.586
IT'S A REPEAT OFFENDER HOW

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:25.389
SERIOUS THE VIOLATION IS- AND

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:27.891
WHETHER OR NOT. A VIOLATION WAS

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.327
A WAS WILLFUL WHETHER OR NOT

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:33.096
RELATED THOSE ARE ALL OF FRIDAY

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.765
OF FACTORS THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:50:34.831 --> 00:50:37.901
CONTAINED IN OUR- I REGULATION-

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:40.771
I BELIEVE THAT IS. THAT IT ON

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:44.074
AN OVERALL BASIS YOUR PROVIDES-

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.275

HOWEVER THERE ARE THEY ARE NOT-

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:53.784
YEAH THERE. AND I THINK THAT

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.152
THERE'S BEEN A LONG CRITICISM

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:57.387
OF- OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND

00:50:57.454 --> 00:51:00.657
SAFETY AND ALL THESE. OUR

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.759
SYSTEM MASON WIDE WHICH IS THAT

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:05.695
YOU KNOW FOR SOME CASES AGAINST

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:07.798
VERY LARGE COMPANIES THEY ARE-

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.466
THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO FOR

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.583
SENATORS WORKERS ARE FACING A

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.318
HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS THAT

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:12.153
IS COSTING THEM THEIR LIVES AND

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.022
THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES.

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.957
THESE ARE WORKERS TO KEEP OUR

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:18.159
GROCERY SHELVES STOCKED THEY

01:23:18.226 --> 01:23:19.894
GROW AND PROCESS OUR FOOD AND

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.596
THEY KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:22.931
ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND OUR

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:25.734
MEMBERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.068
IMPACTED BY COULD NINETEEN

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.770
OUTBREAKS. AND ARE IN

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.638
COMMUNITIES LATINO BLACK

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.774
IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN LOW WAGE

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.543
WORKERS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.779
NOT NEIL WORKERS LACK POWER IN

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.948
THE WORKPLACE. OFF THE BOARD

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:42.150
THEY LACK SUFFICIENT POWER TO

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.252
BE ABLE TO ASSERT AND ENFORCE

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:46.154
THE RIGHT. THIS IS HARD EVEN AT

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.390
UNION WORK SITE BUT IT'S ALMOST

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.191
IMPOSSIBLE A NONUNION

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.594
WORKPLACE. PLACES WE'VE SEEN

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.796
THIS FIRST HAND IN EVERY SECTOR

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.165
AND NOTABLY IN MEAT PACKING

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.833
WHICH WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.001
WORKERS RIGHTS ARE NOT

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.503
MEANINGFUL IF THEY CANNOT BE

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:05.206
ENFORCED. THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.174
WERE SEEN EXACERBATED BY THE

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.810
COULD NINETEEN CRISIS- WE'VE

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.044
HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.513
EMPLOYERS NOT FOLLOWING

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.681
PROTOCOL EMPLOYERS NOT

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.717
NOTIFYING WORKERS OF WORK PLACE

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:18.353
EXPOSURE WORK WORKERS NOT BEING

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.888
TOLD ABOUT THEIR SICK LEAVE

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.723
RATES EMPLOYERS NOT ENFORCING

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.259
DISTANCING. STANDARDS WORKERS

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.194
NOT HAVING PP PROPER

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.896
VENTILATION OR IN DURING

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:30.331
CROWDED AREAS LIKE THE TIME

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.766
CLOCK WHEN THEY PENSION OR

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.135
BREAK ROOMS AND A REMINDER THAT

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:36.271
WE ARE NOT SET UP TO BE ABLE TO

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.740
HANDLE MANY OF THESE.

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:40.074
REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAD TO

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:42.076
RESPOND AND THINK AND COLUSA

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.645
FOR REALLY GETTING GUIDANCE OUT

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:47.081
FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT WE HAVE TO

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:47.816
REALLY ENFORCE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:49.284
NOT LIKE- AT A HOSPITALOR

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.252
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THE YOU

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.787
ARE USED TO EXPOSURE. THE LACK

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:55.089
OF ENFORCEMENT AND THERE HAS

01:24:55.156 --> 01:24:56.624
BEEN SLOW AND FORCE MET WORKERS

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.359
NEED EDUCATION ON THEIR RIGHTS

01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:01.563
IN THE WORKPLACE AND HOW TO

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:02.197
BRING FORWARD A COMPLAINT. YOU

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:03.031
NEED TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS

01:25:03.097 --> 01:25:05.467
REPORT VIOLATIONS TO CALIFORNIA

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.402
THE CHALLENGE HERE AND IT'S I

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.070
THINK THAT FOR MANY REASONS AS

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.206
DOUG MENTIONED BUT IT THE

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.807
PROCESS TAKES SO LONG SO WE

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.742
HAVE WORKERS REPORTING WORK.

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:17.679
WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS IN ISSUES

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:20.181
BUT IT HAS TAKEN MONTHS. I

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:21.282
THINK I'M AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:22.584
HEARD A LITTLE BIT- FROM

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.785
SENATOR DRAW ALSO IS

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.987
RETALIATION. WORKPLACE PROBLEMS

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:27.655
ARE COMPOUNDED BY THE THREAT OF

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.157
RETALIATION AGAINST WORKERS WHO

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:31.125
SPEAK OUT. WHICH HAS A CHILLING

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:33.695
EFFECT ON WORKERS SPEAKING UP.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.663
WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE ENFORCEMENT

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.165
IT'S REALLY COMPLAINT DRIVEN

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.033
RATHER THAN TARGETED AND BASED

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.102
ON RISK FOR VIOLATIONS. AN

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:42.704
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS AT ONE OF

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.839
OUR STORES ITS STORE BY STORE

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.474
COMPLAINT DRIVEN INSTAD OF- AN

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.511
ISSUE THAT WE MAY SEE FOR AN

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:50.111
ENTIRE FOR AN EMPLOYER IN THE

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.714
STATE. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.883
THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AND ARE

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.885
WORKING AND TO PROMOTE IS

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.786
REALLY EMPOWERING WORKERS THE

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:01.723
BEST WAY TO PROTECT THEM IS TO

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:02.357
EMPOWER THEM. THE NEW A TO KNOW

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.091
THERE WORK THEY KNOW THEIR

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:04.726
WORKPLACES BETTER THAN ANYONE

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.928
ELSE THEIR ON SITEDALY THERE

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:08.730
IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY AND STOP

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.798
UNSAFE WORK CONDITIONS. THEY

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.400
CAN REPRT CASES AND DEVELOP

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:13.801
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:16.638
WORKPLACE AND THE INDUSTRY TO

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.006
PROTECT WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC.

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.241
WE NEED POLICIES THAT INCREASE

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.709
WORKERS ROLE IN THE WORKPLACE

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.978
WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE LAWS

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:24.779
AND REGULATIONS THAT SUPPORT

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:27.048
WORKERS TAKING ON AN ACTIVE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:28.616
ROLE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY AT

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:31.085
THE WORKPLACE. AND THIS REALLY

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.754
COMES THROUGH ORGAN ORGANIZING.

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.188
WE ALSO NEED A RAPID AND

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:35.723
EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:38.159
EXISTING LAWS. WE NEED RAPID

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:39.661
ENFORCEMENT FROM KELLER SAID TO

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:41.162

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:43.331
WORKERS WE NEED IN PERSON

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:45.033
INSPECTIONS TO SHOW EMPLOYERS

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:47.001
COMPLIANCE IS IMPORTANT. WE

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.603
NEED TO INCREASE PENALTIES TO

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.638
CREATE TRUE DETERRENT FOR BOTH

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.373

IS FLOURISHING. IT IS

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.993
FLOURISHING. BUT JUST NOT FOR

IS NOT BROKEN. RATHER THE

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:10.338
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.906
TO KEEP FARMWORKERS FROM EVER

01:30:11.973 --> 01:30:14.008
RECEIVING THE ECONOMIC

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.443
RECOGNITION THEY DESERVE. WE

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:18.146
OFFER THE FOLLOWING FARMWORKERS

WOULD FARMWORKERS ORGANIZED

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:27.288
THEY CAN LIFT THEMSELVES UP AND

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.190
GO SHOOT FOR THEMSELVES THE

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:30.358
CURRENT VOTING AND ELECTION

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:32.794

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.667
REPRESSION THAT HAS EXISTED

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.569
SINCE THE DAYS OF SLAVERY. IT

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.538

MUCH AS THEY PRIORITIZE

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:58.419
COMMODITIES. THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.254
WORKERS TO BE PROTECTED WHILE

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.690

ENSURE THAT THE FINES ARE.

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:19.440
COLLECTED NOT JUST ISSUE. THE

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.342
ESSENTIAL WORKER DESIGNATION

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.477
DOESN'T MEAN THAT FARMWORKERS

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:24.912
GET PROTECTIONS THE

WE NEED TO SAFELY DO OUR JOBS.

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:01.842
HAS ONLY ADDED TO THE STRESS

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.010
AND FRUSTRATION THAT WE

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:05.145
CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH DAILY.

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:07.948

HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SUFFER

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:22.763
THROUGH HAS CAUSED MANY

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.131
FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.332

CONTINUE TO RISK THEIR LIVES

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:32.106

HAD AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.521
SERIOUS WORKPLACE INJURIES AND

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:49.223

MINE DO NOT HIRE NEW GRADS OR

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:01.735
TRAINEE NURSES AND THERE IS NO

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:03.304
LONG TERM PLAN TO REPLACE THOSE

01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:04.305
WORKERS AND LESS IT IS WITH

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:05.873
TEMPORARY PER DIEM OR TRAVELER

01:39:05.939 --> 01:39:07.941
NURSES. AND WE'VE ALREADY

01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:08.942
EXHAUSTED THOSE POOLS OF

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:11.145
RESOURCES. SOME HOSPITALS EVEN

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.579
TRIED TO WAVE OUR NURSE TO

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.748
PATIENT RATIOS JUSTIFYING THOSE

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:15.783

INFECTIOUS BEFORE THEY RETURN

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.391
TO WORK. IN MANY CASES

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:58.659
MANAGEMENT HAS SOME NARROWLY

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:00.094
DEFINED WHAT COUNTS AS AN

EXPOSURE. THAT EVEN WHEN NURSES

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.064

SEEING IN WAREHOUSING DURING

OTHER INVESTIGATIONS- WE ALSO

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:53.532
RIGHT NOW HAVE. A RELATIVELY-

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:54.600

ADMINISTRATION AND NO. WE WERE

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:25.831
ABLE TO ACT PRETTY QUICKLY

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:26.966
UNDER THE SOUTH LOSS THAT WE

02:03:27.032 --> 02:03:28.200
HAD THEIR PROCEDURES WE GET

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:29.935

WHERE THEY WILL CALL FOR

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.396
SURVEILLANCE TESTING. AND SO IT

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:25.764

ACCESS TO TESTING AND ALSO IS

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:29.334
THERE A MANDATE IF THE TEST IS

SAY A UNIT THAT CAN BE DONE IN

02:13:37.376 --> 02:13:38.410
THE WORKPLACE SO IT'S NOT

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:39.277
ACTUALLY SENT FORMALLY TO A

02:13:39.344 --> 02:13:41.113

TESTING ITSELF. AS A STRATEGY

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:54.459
BUT CERTAINLY TESTING AS PART

02:13:54.526 --> 02:13:55.761

WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN EARLIER ON.

02:26:40.525 --> 02:26:42.393
THE PANDEMICS BUT- I WOULD NOTE

02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:46.297
THAT- IN THIS REPORT THAT.

02:26:46.364 --> 02:26:47.999
THERE WERE ALMOST SEVEN

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:48.900
THOUSAND CODE RELATED

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:51.602
COMPLAINTS HOWEVER ONLY. ELEVEN

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:53.037
HUNDRED SO ABOUT ONE IN SIX

02:26:53.104 --> 02:26:54.238
WERE ACTUALLY ON SITE

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:55.940
INSPECTIONS SO THE REST OF

02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:58.709
THEM. THE OTHER FIVE SIX WERE

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:00.645
NOT AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THE

02:27:00.711 --> 02:27:02.113

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.081
ALSO NOTE THAT OF THOSE ONSITE

02:27:04.148 --> 02:27:08.686

DIED. FOR ILLNESS SIGNS ON RY

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:18.663
GOT SICK IN FACT THAT NUMBER IS

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:20.932
LARGER COMBINED THEN THE NUMBER

02:27:20.998 --> 02:27:22.366

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:29.440
ITSELF SO YOU YOU GOT TO

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:31.275

THE REFERRAL BASED INSPECTIONS

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:41.052
IS FAIRLY SMALL SO I THINK WE

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:41.652
HAVE MORE WORK TO DO IN TERMS

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:44.555

02:27:49.894 --> 02:27:51.195
WOULD SAY THAT THE NUMBER OF ON

02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:52.997
SITE INSPECTIONS IN RELATION TO

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:54.031
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CODE OR

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:55.566
PLAY IT SEEMS TO BE VERY FEES

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:57.235
YOU KNOW. ONE IN SIX SEEMS TO

02:27:57.301 --> 02:27:58.836
BE A FAIRLY SMALL PERCENTAGE.

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:00.137
IS THAT PERCENTAGE REFLECTIVE

02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:01.505
OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING

02:28:01.572 --> 02:28:03.474
OR IS THAT MUCH HIGHER NOW THAN

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.008
IT WAS IT PERHAPS AT THE

02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.776
BEGINNING THE PANDEMIC. AND

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:09.647

ONSLAUGHT OF COMPLAINTS WOULD

02:29:33.731 --> 02:29:35.466
BE TO SET UP A TRIAGE SYSTEM

LETTER INVESTIGATIONS WHICH

02:29:45.443 --> 02:29:46.844
MEANS THAT WE SENT A LETTER TO

THE EMPLOYER TO GATHER EVIDENCE

THEIR RESPONSE AND THEN WHICH

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:54.185
WE USE THAT AS A AS A SOURCE OF

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.620
INFORMATION A TRIGE AND THEN

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:57.621
WE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

02:29:57.688 --> 02:29:59.457
WHETHER THE- WHETHER THE

02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:01.425
RESPONSE IS SATISFACTORY WE TRY

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:02.893
TO. CONFIRM THAT WITH THE

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.295
WORKER IF WORKERS MADE A

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:08.165
COMPLAINT AND IDENTIFY. A HER

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.667
OR HIMSELF. AND THEN YOU KNOW

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:13.504
PROCEED ON THAT BASIS. THAT

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:16.340
WE'VE- YOU KNOW WE'VE RESOLVED

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:19.710
ABOUT FOUR OR MORE THAN FOUR

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:20.111
THOUSAND OF THOSE

02:30:20.177 --> 02:30:22.480
INVESTIGATIONS THREE OF A-

02:30:22.546 --> 02:30:24.281
LETTER INSPECTION PROCESS- WE

02:30:24.348 --> 02:30:25.549
SENT MORE LETTERS AND THEN A

02:30:25.616 --> 02:30:28.686
NUMBER OF OTHER ARM CANDY- YEAH

02:30:28.753 --> 02:30:34.258
THIS WAS A STRATEGY THAT WE-

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:35.426
TRANSFER KIND OF BECAUSE WE

02:30:35.493 --> 02:30:36.494
KNEW THAT WE WERE GONNA GET A-

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:38.462
YOU KNOW. IT'S ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:40.331
HIGH NUMBER OF FATALITIES AND

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:41.899
ILLNESSES THAT WE WERE GOING TO

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:44.502
HAVE TO INVESTIGATE- WHICH ARE

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.404
MANDATED BY. THERE'S

02:30:46.470 --> 02:30:49.874
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THERE AND-

02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:53.411
YEAH AND- WE- THOUGHT THAT THE

02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:54.945
USE OF THESE LETTER INSPECTIONS

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:56.580
WERE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS AN IN

02:30:56.647 --> 02:30:58.516
PERSON INSPECTION. WAS GONNA

02:30:58.582 --> 02:30:59.984
ALLOW US TO TRIAGE AND THEN

02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:02.219
REACHED OF MOST WORKERS THAT WE

02:31:02.286 --> 02:31:03.721
POSSIBLY COULD BECAUSE WE KNEW

02:31:03.788 --> 02:31:05.556
THAT IF WE DID COMPLAINTS IN

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:08.859
THESE- CASES ARE YOU KNOW WE

02:31:08.926 --> 02:31:09.794
SIMPLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

THE MOST OF THEIR COMPLAINTS

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:16.267
AND SO THIS WAS A WAY OF

02:31:16.333 --> 02:31:19.503
MAXIMIZING OUR REACH- IT'S NOT

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.337
A NEW PROCEDURE WE'VE BEEN

02:31:20.404 --> 02:31:22.473

YEARS. WE ACTUALLY DO- FEWER

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:28.312

THAT WE- WHERE WE USE THAT

02:31:33.651 --> 02:31:42.393
