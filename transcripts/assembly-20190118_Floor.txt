ABOUT THE INJUSTICES IN THE MANY SYSTEMS THAT DEFINE AND HARNESS OUR COUNTRY. IN EDUCATION IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH HEALTHCARE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. VOTING RIGHTS. GENDER BIAS. THE ENVIRONMENT.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO CAUCUS. IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A C. R. TOWN. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WAS AN AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEER WHOSE IMPACT IS IMMEASURABLE. HIS WORK WAS UNDOUBTEDLY PROGRESSIVE. AND FOCUSED ON RACIAL EQUALITY ECONOMIC EQUALITY. AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. DESPITE THE CONSTANCY AND HARASSMENT OF CONSTANCY OF VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT HE ANOTHER SPACED DR KING WORKED TIRELESSLY TO MAINTAIN THE MOVEMENT. OF PEACEFUL RESISTANCE. HIS STRENGTH AND DETERMINATION TO FIGHT FOR SOMETHING HE SO STRONGLY BELIEVED IN REGARDLESS OF THIS THREATS ON HIS LIFE. SHOWS A REMARKABLE EXTRAORDINARY PERSON HE WAS. DR KING OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO HELP CHANGE PUBLIC POLICY FOR ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR. LEADING TO THE PASSAGE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND OTHER LAWS INTENDED TO TERMINATE. LEGAL AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS IN AMERICA. DR KING'S MESSAGES YOU APPEAR TO ME OF HOPE FREEDOM AND PERSEVERANCE. ALTHOUGH WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WE STILL HAVE MUCH TO DO. WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE WE HAVE AN AMERICA THE DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR AND HIS COMPLETE CONTEMPORARIES WOULD BE PROUD TO LIVE IN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ADDRESS MR GABRIEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. TO HONOR THE REMARKABLE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. THE JEWISH CAUCUS IS PROUD TO STAND WITH SO MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES IN RECOGNIZING DR KING. AS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS OF ANY GENERATION. DR KING IS ALWAYS OCCUPIED A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICAN JEWS. FOR MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY DOCTOR KING WAS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM HUMAN DIGNITY AND JUSTICE BUT ARE THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF JEWISH TRADITION. INDEED FEW IMAGES INSPIRE AS MUCH EMOTION AND PRIDE IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AS THE ICONIC IMAGE OF DOCTOR OF RIVER OF RABBI ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL. THE MOST REVERED RABBIS OF HIS GENERATION MARCHING ARM IN ARM WITH DOCTOR KING ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AFTERWARDS IN WORDS THAT WERE QUOTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA HALF A CENTURY LATER. RABBI HESCHEL REFLECTED THAT WHEN HE WAS MARCHING WITH DOCTOR KING HE FELT THAT HIS LEGS WERE PRAYING. THAT SAME YEAR THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE ON OR DOCTOR KING WITH ITS FIRST YOU JUST AMERICAN LIBERTIES MEDALLION. IN RECOGNITION OF HIS EFFORTS TO ADVANCE CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICANS. DOCTOR KING WAS ALSO GREAT FRIEND AND ALLY TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN OUR OWN STRUGGLES. HE SPOKE OUT POWERFULLY AGAINST ANTI SEMITISM IN DEFENSE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL. AND IT ENDED AND ON BEHALF OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR PERSECUTED JEWS IN THE SOVIET UNION. THE GLOBAL JEWISH COMMUNITIES TREMENDOUS AFFECTION FOR DR KING IS PERHAPS BEST EVIDENT IN JERUSALEM. WHERE EACH DAY THOUSANDS WALKED DOWN A BOULEVARD RENAMED IN HIS HONOR? IN THE HEART OF THE CITY WHERE THE STREETS ARE NAMED FOR THE GREAT KINGS AND PROFITS OF ANCIENT ISRAEL. THE JEWISH PEOPLE CHOSE TO OUT OF THOROUGHFARE NAME FOR AMERICA'S GREAT PROFIT OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THIS WEEKEND JEWISH COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WILL HOLD SPECIAL SERVICES TO HONOR DOCTOR KING. WE WILL TEACH OUR CHILDREN ABOUT HIS ENORMOUS BRAVERY HIS MORAL CLARITY AND HIS ON FINISH STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE. WE WERE REFLECT ON HIS TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND YET ALSO CRINGE AT HOW MUCH WORK REMAINS TO TRULY FULFILL HIS DREAM. AND WE WILL SEEK TO HONOR HIS LEGACY BY JOINING HANDS WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES TO ADVANCE JUSTICE AND HELP FULFILL HIS VISION. IN THAT SPIRIT AND ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THERE WAS A REAL MISSED COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM VERY PLEASED TO RISE TODAY IN HONOR OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. AND ON THIS DAY I'M ALWAYS. PRONE TO THINK OF HIM. AND THINK OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND A COOLEY -- WHO IS OF AFRO AMERICAN HERITAGE? BECAUSE OF COURSE THE WORK OF DR KING CHANGE THE WORLD FOR HER. SHE'S NOW STARTING SCHOOL HERE IN RANCHO CORDOVA [inaudible] AND ON THIS DAY AS I REFLECT UPON DOCTOR KING AND JUSTICE. MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. COMMITTED TO JUST GIVING EXPRESSION TO WHAT HE HAD CONVICTIONS ON THE IMPACT OF HIS LIFE. THE TRANSFORMATIVE WAY IN WHICH HE TOUCHED OTHER'S. AND INFLUENCES INFLUENCE THEM. IN MULTIPLE WAYS. HE INFLUENCE SOME PEOPLE. TO JOIN THE FIGHT. TO BUCK THEM UP. TO PERSEVERE IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGE. HE ENCOURAGE OTHERS PEOPLE HEARTENED. TO FEEL REMEMBERED. TO FEEL VALUED. AND THEN OF COURSE IN YET ANOTHER WAY HE HE I THANK. POLL THE SCREEN AWAY MADE IT EASIER TO TO SAY WELL. I I JUST HEARD SOMETHING EXPRESS WHICH IS WRONG. WHICH IS NOT RIGHT. WHICH I DO NOT AGREE WITH. WHICH MAY BE A CONVENTIONAL ATTITUDE WAS NOT A RIGHT ATTITUDE. SO PEOPLE EMBOLDENED PEOPLE HE HARDENED AND PEOPLE YOU SORT OF SAID. WHAT'S GOING ON AND WITH ALL OF THIS IT BECAUSE WE REFLECT UPON. AS HE WAS IN A MINISTER. THE BOOK OF ISAIAH. AND PERMISSION TO READ BRIEFLY WITHOUT OBJECTION. THIS IS THE I'D SAY A THIRTY TWO AND I'LL POINT OUT TO YOU THAT THE THIRD WORD AND WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF MY MOUTH IS KING. SEE A KING. WILL REIGN IN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND RULERS WILL RULE WITH JUSTICE. SURE AND THAT WAS WHAT HE KEPT HIS EYE UPON [inaudible] THE KING. BUT JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. IN THE WAY OUR SOCIETY WAS RULED EACH. ONE WILL BE LIKE A SHELTER FROM THE WIND. IN A REFUGE FROM THE STORM. SO NOW WE HAVE WHERE SOMEONE ACTS WITH JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS. THEY ARE CREATING SAFE SPACES FOR PEOPLE. ISN'T THIS WHAT HE HAS DONE. LIKE STREAMS OF WATER IN THE DESERT AND THE SHADOW OF A GREAT ROCK IN A THIRSTY LAND. THAT'S AN INTERESTING IMAGE ISAIAH. SHOT OF A GREAT ROCK AND WERE LAND THAT ACTUALLY MEANS. A BIG ROCK OF THE LANDSCAPE. THAT THE SUN POUNDS UPON. THEREBY CREATING SAFE SPACES. NO THAT'S SAVE QUITE A VIVID IMAGE OF LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S MOST TRAGIC DAY. IT'S AN IMAGE OF HIS LEADERSHIP. THAT BY HIS LIFE. HE WAS OUT THERE IN THE BEATING SON. CRITICS A SPACES FOR PEOPLE. AND AND BEARING THAT COST. THEN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SEE SAYS AYES THERE WILL NO LONGER BE CLOSED. AND THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEAR WILL LISTEN. THIS WORK OF LEADERSHIP CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE PERCEIVE THE WORLD AROUND THEM. OPEN OUR EYES OPEN ERRORS. THE FEARFUL HEART WILL NO ONE UNDERSTANDS. AND THE STAMMERING TONGUE WILL BE FLUENT IN CLEAR. TOUCHING LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE SEVEN THIS MAY. AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS KING IN THE WAY HE CONDUCTS HIMSELF AND MARTIN LUTHER KING. NO LONGER WILL THE FOOL BE CALLED NOBLE. NO THE SCOUNDREL BE HIGHLY RESPECTED. SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT DATE REMEMBER THE PROFOUND WORK OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING. HIS LEADERSHIP. HIS COMMITMENT TO KINGDOM VALUES AS HE UNDERSTOOD THEM. THE INSPIRATION AS BRENDA GENERATIONS OF LEADERS. THE SOURCE OF HOPE TO PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE FELT AT RISK. AND GIVEN US ALL THE ABILITY THE KIND OF SAY. TIMES UP. THE VOICE I'M HEARING IS NOT A VOICE THAT I AGREE WITH. IT'S ACTUALLY VOICE OF POLLY AND CERTAINLY IN OUR DAY IN OUR SOCIETY WE NEED PEOPLE STAND UP. AND SAY THAT. SO IT'S AN HONOR STAND HERE IN HONOR OF THIS DAY THANK YOU. NAME IS COOLEY MISTER GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY -- LGBT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORTER ACR TEN WITH APPRECIATION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. IT IS A MATTER OF SOME. DEBATE WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY WHERE KING STOOD WHEN IT CAME TO OUR ISSUES. I MYSELF HAVE NO DEBATE ON THE MATTER IT IS CLEAR THE KING STOOD ON THE SIDE OF LGBT A QUALITY. YOU CAN SEE IT ALL AROUND MAYBE NOT IN HIS WORDS ARE HIS SPECIFIC ACTIONS DIRECTLY RELATED TO LGBT COMMUNITY WE KNOW WITHIN HIS MOVEMENT. OUR COMMUNITY WAS ALWAYS REPRESENTED. THE MARCH IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE GENIUS ABED RUSTED. A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO WAS OUT IN A TIME WHEN IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO DO EMBRACED BY DR KING IS A PART OF HIS LEADERSHIP CIRCLE. HIS WIFE HIS WIDOW CORETTA SCOTT KING WAS A PASSIONATE ELOQUENT STRONG VOICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY AGAIN WHEN IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY POPULAR. TO DO THAT SHE REMAINS AN ICON FOR EQUALITY FOR LGBT AMERICANS. AND SO WHETHER IT'S HIS WIFE FOR HIS INNER CIRCLE CLEARLY KING WAS INFLUENCED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO KNEW THAT EQUALITY MET NOT JUST RACIAL JUSTICE. BUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE IN THE WAY OF NOW. THE TENETS OF OUR MOVEMENT OF LGBT EQUAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ARE COMPLETELY CONNECTED. TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE BROADER CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. CONCEPTS LIKE WE SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF OUR CHARACTER. THAT IS EQUAL TO US THAT IS A PILLAR OF OUR MOVEMENT. THE IDEA THE INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE IS A PART OF OUR MOVEMENT. AND OF COURSE THE IDEA THAT SEPARATE IS NOT EQUAL IS VERY MUCH A PART OF OUR MOVEMENT. AND SO WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS OUTSPOKEN. ABOUT MARRIAGE EQUALITY WHEN IT CAME TO OF RACIAL INTEGRATION. BUT WE KNOW HE WAS ALSO TALKING. ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO HAVE MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND I WOULD LINK UP THE ABILITY IN THE FACT THAT OUR MOVEMENTS ARE INTER TWINED BY THE FACT THAT WE TODAY ENJOY THE ABILITY TO SERVE OPENLY IN THE MILITARY. AND THE ABILITY TO GET MARRIED IN THIS NATION BECAUSE THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT UNITED STATES HELP CHAMPION THOSE ISSUES. SO I STAND A ON BEHALF OF A CAUCUS EIGHT STRONG AND A DEEP APPRECIATION TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. OUR ISSUES ARE LEADS WE ARE INTERSECTIONAL OUR SUCCESS IS NOT EXCLUSIVE IT IS MUTUAL AND WE ARE DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE FOR THE IMPACT THE DOCTOR KING HAS MADE. IN RACIAL JUSTICE BUT ALSO FOR LGBT EQUALITY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER GIBSON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. JUST VERY BRIEFLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE DOCTOR MARTHA KING -- FOR YOUR HEARING. LIFE BEGINS THE IN THE MOMENT YOU START BEING SILENT ABOUT THE THINGS THAT MATTER. IN THE END WE WERE NOT REMEMBER THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES BUT THE A SILENCE. OF OUR FRIENDS. WE WILL HAVE TO REPENT IN THIS GENERATION NOT MERELY FOR THEIR VITRIOLIC WORDS AND ACTION OF THE BAD PEOPLE. BUT THE APPALLING SILENCE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE THERE COMES A TIME THAT SILENCE IS A FORM OF BETRAYAL. DAVIS GIPSON ALL DISCUSSION ON THE RESOLUTION HAVING SEIZE. DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES WHO'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO RESPOND TO THIS RESOLUTION. AND TO GIVE US QUOTES AND AND ASPECTS OF DR KING'S LIFE WHICH WAS AN AMAZING LIFE. THAT RESULTED IN A VERY EARLY AN UNFORTUNATE DEATH. IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME SOME LAST YEAR AS I LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF DR KING'S ASSASSINATION. THAT MOST OF YOU DID NOT LIVE DURING THE TIME OF KING. THERE WERE FEW OF US WHO DID IT AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE. AND SO MOST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND FEELINGS ABOUT KING A REALLY FROM A BOOK. FROM THE MOVIE FROM SOME STORIES OF PEOPLE TOLD YOU. AS I POINTED OUT YESTERDAY I WAS A STUDENT UCLA. WHEN WE GOT THE WORD THE DOCTOR KING HAD BEEN KILLED? IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT A MAN OF PEACE. COULD BE TAKEN AWAY IN SUCH A VIOLENT ACT. AND A LEFT US ALL WONDERING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY. WE ALSO BETRAYED. WE OUGHT WE ALL FELT THAT SOMEHOW ANOTHER. ALL OF THE GOOD THAT THIS MAN HAD DONE. WAS TO EXPOSE THE HATRED. OF OF THOSE WHO ARE IRRATIONAL. TO TAKE HIS LIFE. AND WE WONDERED IF THE DREAM WOULD DIE WOULD DOCTOR KING. WAS THERE NOT PLANTED IN INDIVIDUALS IN THIS NATION TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS JUST. AND THOSE WHO WERE MOST FRUSTRATED TOOK THE STREETS AND BURN THE CITIES.% BECAUSE THEY WERE SO ANGRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT DOCTOR KING WAS DEAD. THAT THE KING WAS THE IT. THE DREAM WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. AND THAT ALL OF THE FIVE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR WOULD BE MESSED. MOST OF US KNOW ABOUT THE SOUTH. AB MY FAMILY HAD COME FROM THE SOUTH AND I VISITED THE SOUTH MANY TIMES AS A CHILD. AND WE DO OF THE UGLINESS OF RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION. WE KNEW HOW IT MADE PEOPLE FEEL. MOST OF US THAT HAVE RELATIVES MY GRANDFATHER NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO VOTE IN THIS NATION. WAS A CITIZEN OF THIS NATION BORN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT NEVER HAD THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND SO WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS TO TALK ABOUT JIM CROW IN A VERY REAL SENSE. AND I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO TRAVEL TO THE SOUTH AND NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM. THURGOOD MARSHALL TALKED ABOUT THAT IT IS NOT JUST AN INCONVENIENCE RACISM IT IS IT TAKES AWAY YOUR DIGNITY AND YOUR PRIDE AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DO JUST THE SIMPLE THINGS OF LIFE. AND SO DR KING'S LIFE REPRESENTED ALL OF THAT TO US. AND SO HERE WE STOOD AT UCLA AND AROUND THE NATION YOUNG PEOPLE. WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE BEING TOLD BY ALL OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATION THE PAMPA ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS. THAT NONVIOLENCE DID NOT WORK. BUT ALL IT DID WAS PRODUCE VIOLENCE IN KING'S LIFE WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. AND SO WE HAD SOME ISSUES AND CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER NOT THIS COUNTRY WOULD CONTINUE THE LEGACY TO CONTINUE THE WORK. THAT HAD NOT BEEN FINISHED. WE STILL HAVE A QUESTION TODAY. IT HAS NOT GONE AWAY. THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THIS COUNTRY IS AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE. TO BE CHALLENGES WE FACE EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND WE WILL KNOW THAT AT THE TIME OF KING'S DEATH BUT HE WAS NOT A POPULAR PERSON. HE'S VERY POPULAR TODAY BECAUSE HE'S NOT A LOT. YES HE'S NOT CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE US DIRECTLY. BUT HE WAS NOT POPULAR WHEN HE DIED. WE KNEW THAT HE WAS HE HAD LOW APPROVAL RATINGS IN MANY COMMUNITIES. HE WAS SEEN AS THE ENEMY THE F. B. I.'S SAW HIM AS THE ENEMY AND THE AND THE WORST THING -- TO FOR DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO HE LIVED THE LIFE THAT WAS DIFFICULT. HE CAME TO SAN DIEGO AND NONE OF THE BLACK MINISTERS WILL LET HIM SPEAK AT THE CHURCHES IN THE SIXTIES. BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF BEING SEEN WITH THIS RADICAL. AND SO HE INSTEAD HE SPOKE IN THE GYMNASIUM AT SAN DIEGO STATE. AND THAT BECAME THE PRIDE OF SAN DIEGO STATE THAT THEY OPEN THEIR DOORS TO MARTIN LUTHER KING. BUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE MINISTER'S WOULD NOT LET HIM SPEAK FOR FEAR OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM. AND THEY'D BE IDENTIFIED WITH HIS RADICAL INDIVIDUALS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT KING. IF WE WANT TO BE LIKE KING. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE UNPOPULAR TIMES. BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS JUST. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS A POPULARITY CONTEST WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY. WHAT WE HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN A UNIQUE CHANCE TO BE THE DOCTOR KING OF OUR GENERATION? TO DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT ISSUES THEN THE HARD ISSUES. AND TRY TO BRING SOME JUSTICE AND EQUALITY TO SO MANY. WE OFTEN STAND ON THIS FLOOR WITH DIFFICULT BILLS DEAL WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES. AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF THAT THIS COUNTRY JUST LAST YEAR MAY LYNCHING ILLEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY. UNBELIEVABLE AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF TORTURE AND LYNCHING WE FINALLY PASSED ABOUT A BILL IN WASHINGTON TO MAKE LYNCHING ILLEGAL. THAT IS A FORM OF TERRORISM THAT CONTINUES TO EXIST. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE OTHER FORMS OF KILLING ILLEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY. OUR SPEAKER YESTERDAY TALK ABOUT STEFAN CLARK. WHICH CONTINUES THE LEGACY OF DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIPS WITH POLICE OFFICERS ARE PEOPLE OF AUTHORITY IN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO COMMUNITIES. THOSE ARE NOT EASY ISSUES THERE DIFFICULT ISSUES. BUT WE STAND WITH KING WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT BASICALLY DEALING WITH THOSE ISSUES WILL BE ISSUES THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN A STRONG WAY THAT MAY NOT MAKE US POPULAR. BUT IN THE END WILL GIVE US A LEGACY OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. I'VE OFTEN SAID ON THIS FLOOR AS I CLOSE [inaudible] THAT FREEDOM. EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. IS A RARE FLOWER. THE DEMANDS CONSTANT ATTENTION AND WATERING AND LOVE AND CARE. BUT WE KNOW THAT HATRED IS A WHEAT. AND IT GROWS BEST IN NYC LACKED. AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE BEAUTY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE GREATNESS OF THIS NATION. IT WILL DEMAND FROM US CONSTANT ATTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WEEDS OF HATE DO NOT GROW AND FASTER IN AMERICA. MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

TO SOCIETY AND ARE NOW CONTRIBUTING TO THIS GREAT STATE AND NATION. SO I STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH MY COMMUNITY. IN RESPECTFULLY ASKING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO HONOR. THAT AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER DEEP. THIS CALL ROUTE YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANNA THANK -- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ANAHEIM FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION FOR THEM -- HONORED TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED AND STAND ALSO -- ON BEHALF A. P. I. CAUCUS -- YOU KNOW ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEE FAMILIES OR OR NOT NEW AND IN FACT WE'VE SEEN. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS ADMINISTRATION NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED VIETNAMESE. BOAT INDIVIDUALS OF ALREADY BEEN DEPORTED BACK TO COUNTRIES THAT THEY HARDLY KNOW OR IN SOME CASES DON'T KNOW AT ALL. NOW THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION IS EXPANDING THEIR EFFORTS -- SEEKING TO DEPORT VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WHO RIDE TO THE UNITED STATES BEFORE JULY NINETEEN NINETY FIVE JUST REGARDING. AN AGREEMENT -- WITH VIETNAM THAT WOULD OUR TIME REFUGEES FROM DEPORTATION -- AS WE'VE HEARD FROM -- OF OUR COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA IS HOME. TO THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST SOUTHEAST ASIAN AND SPECIFICALLY VIETNAMESE POPULATION IN FACT SAN JOSE HAS THE LARGEST BIT MEANS POPULATION ANY SINGLE CITY OUTSIDE OF VIETNAM. MANY OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WOULD BE DEPORTED TO COUNTRIES THEY FLED. AS INTENSE AND AS CHILDREN. AND IT CERTAINLY COOL TO TURN OUR BACKS ON REFUGEES WHO DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER HOME THEN THE UNITED STATES -- AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT DISSIMILAR TO THE ISSUES HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES WHO ARE SEEKING ASYLUM. AND SOME MAY THINK WELL THIS WAS DECADES AGO THAT'S IN THE PAST. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FAR FROM HISTORY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT AS SOON AS MANY OF THESE REFUGEES CAME TO OUR SHORES AND MADE AMERICA THEIR HOME THEY STARTED EXERCISING THE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE IN THIS NATION. OF FREEDOM THE RIGHTS TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH THEY'VE SPOKEN UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND VIETNAM NOT JUST TWENTY THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO BUT TO THIS DAY. AND WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN VIETNAM RIGHT NOW THEIR JAILING PEOPLE THEY'RE BEATING PEOPLE THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE THAT ARE SPEAKING UP. THE SPEEDING UP TO STAND UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS TO STAND AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. IN THEIR NATION AND TO STAND UP AGAINST AGGRESSION FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS. AND SO THIS IS A VERY REAL THREAT IT'S NOT EXISTENTIALISTS. IF INDIVIDUALS ARE DEPORTED BACK. TO BE AT NAM THEY VERY VERY LIKELY WILL BE IMPRISONED. JAILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME THEY COULD BE PHYSICALLY HARMED. AND CERTAINLY THERE LIFE CAN BE THREATENED SO THIS IS NOT -- AN ISSUE BUT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME ARE TRYING TO PROTECT OF FOLKS WHO NOW CALL AMERICA HOME WHICH THEY DO AND THAT BY ITSELF WOULD BE VALID AND OF VALUE. HOWEVER THIS IS A REAL THREAT AND LIVES ARE BEING PLAYED WITH IN A WAY -- THAT IS DANGEROUS AND WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE. MANIPULATING OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM OR AGREEMENTS WE HAVE WITH OTHER NATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT AMERICANS PROTECT PEOPLE AND PROTECT THOSE WHO CALL THIS NATION HOME. AND SO I URGE OUR COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT AG ARE ONE AND AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ANAHEIM FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER KANSEN CHU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. CHECK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SAM I'M MEMBERS AYE RICE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE MANY API CAUCUS MEMBERS.

DISH AND NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR OF BEING DEPORTED. TWO A COUNTRY THAT THE WORD FORCE TO OF FLEE FROM. IT'S A SIMPLE. THERE IS A AGREEMENT IN PLACE. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO CONSIDER CHANGING THAT. I'M GLAD THAT WE COMMITTED TO STAND BEHIND THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY AND AGAINST POLICIES THAT MAKE PEOPLE FILL THEM -- WELL CALM AND FEAR. FOR ON BEHALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS FROM ANAHEIM AND MANY AUG A SIMPLICITY AND MANY OTHER PLACES FOR BRINGING THIS A RESOLUTION. FOR IT IS THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO AND I URGE FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

ONE AND I POINT OUT I HAVE THE TREATY OF MY HAND. IT'S A SIMPLE TREATY STRAIGHT FORWARD. CAN BE CANCELLED IN THIRTY DAYS BY EITHER GOVERNMENT. I SEE NO REASON. WHY THE UNITED STATES WOULD WANT TO CHANGE THIS TREATY IN ANY WAY BECAUSE? IN MY OWN TRAINED LAW I IT LOOKS LIKE IF WE WANT TO DEPORT OF OF NEWLY ARRIVED VIETNAMESE CRIMINAL. THE TREATY ALLOWS IT. AND IT'S A VERY FAIR TREATY BECAUSE VIGT NAM ESSENTIALLY HAS THE LAST SAY. ON WHETHER THEY'RE DEPORTED OR NOT. NOT TOO BAD PRETTY FAIR TREATY SO HOPEFULLY THE PRESIDENT WILL NOT. CHANGE IT OR CANCEL IT. I DO SUPPORT THIS. STRONGLY THANK YOU. THEY MUST VOEPEL MISTER PATTERSON YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. MEMBERS AYE STANNIS DRAWING SUPPORT OF THIS A C. R.
