CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS ABLE

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.085
TO STILL DISCIPLINE THE NURSE

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.222
AND THE SENSE THAT CALIFORNIA

HAD IVERTED MEDICATION BAY CAN

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:22.045
BAND AND CALIFORNIA CAN CHOOSE

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:24.247
TO. AB IN A COULD YOU COULD NOT

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.715

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.151
IT WHAT IN IT COULD SHOOT TO

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:31.120
THE SPEND- BAT PRIVILEGE TO

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.089

NURSE JUST A THOUGHT THE NEW

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.427
BUDGET. I SOMETHING TO BE A

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.896
PROGRAM OR HELP COULD REVOKE

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:42.365
THAT PRIVILEGE ONE CALIFORNIA

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.833
WHEN THAT'S GOING ON THAT

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.934
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE IN MY

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:46.669
CALIFORNIA'S DISCIPLINING THE

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.304
COLUMN RIGHT A NURSE CALIFORNIA

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.306
HAS TO COMMUNICATE THAT

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.241
INFORMATION TO COLORADO BECAUSE

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.543
THAT'S WHERE THE NURSES

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:55.111
ORIGINALLY LIKE. THAT

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:56.879
COLORADO'S BANG USE THE

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:59.282
INFORMATION FROM CALIFORNIA AND

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:05.488
DISCIPLINE THE NURSES LICENSED.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.889
SO MAYBE COLORADO. IT ALSO SAYS

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.191
THAT THE LIGHTS BASE ON WHAT

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.292
HAPPENED AND CAL. BUT BACK

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.094
SHARE INFORMATION SHARING IS A

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.930
REQUIREMENT OF THE COMPACT. AND

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:16.599
AGAIN WHEN CALL IF COLORADO AND

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.634
DID IT IF THE PLAN THE NURSE

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:21.637
BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S-

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:23.873
INVESTIGATION WHICH IS ABOUT

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.841
CALL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THE

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.610
VAST MAJORITY OF CASES- BAND

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:28.878
WHILE THAT NURSES UNDER THAT

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.780
THE PLAN HER PRIVILEGES TO

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:35.518
PRACTICE AND- ANY OF THE STATES

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.919
WOULD BE SUSPENDED. SO THAT'S

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:40.123
KIND OF THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN IF

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.224
YOU'RE A STATE THAT ISSUE THE

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.458
LIGHTS AND THE OR IF YOU'RE THE

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:43.559
STATE WHERE THAT NURSES

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:47.563
PRACTICING. WELL I GUESS I'D

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.065
SAY IS I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.700
A LOT OF ISSUES- THINGS ARE OUT

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.336
OF AN ANALYSIS THAT- NEED TO BE

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.804
EXAMINED I THINK DISCIPLINE

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.072
CERTAINLY IS ONE OF THOSE IN

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.641
TERMS OF CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.976
TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:01.244
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.312
PRACTICE IN THE STATE. AND TO

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.413
BE DEPENDENT ON OF OTHER

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.848
LICENSING BOARD EXHIBIT

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:07.650
CONCERNING AND I THINK NEEDS

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.152
MUCH FURTHER EXAMINATION AS

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:10.520
WELL AS MANY OTHER ISSUES I

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:11.854
THINK THAT WERE RAISED A- IN

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.491
THE TESTIMONY. SO EIGHT NO WE

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.859
HAVE A PROCESS HERE IN THIS

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:19.262
COMMITTEE- LEAD BUYER CHAIR AND

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.264
ALSO THAT BOTH YOU AND SEND AND

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.132
ASSEMBLY AND TERMS OF REVIEWING

THE VARIOUS BOARDS AND SO

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.402
FORTH- WHAT I CERTAINLY

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.438
APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THIS BILL

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:30.940

THANK YOU. THIS NEEDS TO BE A

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:36.012
MUCH MORE. THOUGHT OUT AND

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.114
CAREFULLY REVIEWED PROPOSAL AND

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.448
I DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.584
ABOUT THAT. THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.852
A SERVICE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:46.856
NATIONALIZING- YEAH. THE POWER

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:47.857
TO LICENSES THAT GRANT TO THE

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:49.125
STATE THAT'S UNDER THE TENTH

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:51.961
AMENDMENT THE CONSTITUTION- AND

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.429
I THINK THAT- WE NEED HONOR

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.465
THAT. AND SO- AT THIS POINT

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.533
UNFORTUNATELY NOT ABLE TO

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.901
SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.469
NEEDS MUCH FURTHER WORK THANK

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:01.637

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.645
OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE- **** BUT

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:12.181
I JUST WANTED TO. THIS TO MAKE

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:14.016
A LITTLE COMMENT I THINK IS

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.085
USE. INDICATED IN YOUR FIRST

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.286
STATEMENT THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.155
ADVANTAGES TO THIS AND I THINK

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.790
THERE COULD BE AND IT THERE ARE

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:23.559
POTENTIAL. ADVANTAGES FOR OF

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.194
FOR CALIFORNIA BUT IN LOOKING

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.762
AT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.365
FACED WITH THE LEGISLATION. AND

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:32.335
MOVING TO A- A COMPACT- WITH

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.036
OTHER STATES FOR OUR- BE AND

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:36.005
SO. I THINK WE AT THE END OF

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.206
THE DAY WE WOULD BE DIFFERENT

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:39.242
TO THE- LOWEST COMMON

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:41.177
DENOMINATOR AND CALIFORNIA.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:43.312
PRIDES ITSELF ON THE TREMENDOUS

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:44.513
HEALTH CARE WE HAVE AND

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.183
CERTAINLY OUR ENGINE. AND A LV

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.851
ENDS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.087
AND- I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.722
THE STANDARDS THAT WE SET AND

01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:54.423
THE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.193
REGULATIONS THAT WE APPLY. SO I

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.662
WOULD JUST BE FEARFUL THAT WE

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:00.229
WOULD BE GOING DOWN TO. THE

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.365
SLOPE BUT AT THIS POINT WITHOUT

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.233
THE SAFEGUARDS IT COULD BE A IN

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.368
THE LEGISLATION SO

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:06.469
UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE ABLE

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.771

OUR PROCESS IS LENGTHY ONLY

AREAS SUCH AS IN SOUTHERN

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:58.567
CALIFORNIA. THE FORECAST THE

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.069
HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US FROM ARE

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.705
YOU SEE S. F. RESEARCHERS SHOWS

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:04.406
THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OVER

WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.180
SO THERE ARE REGIONAL

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.249
DIFFERENCES SOME OF THOSE AREAS

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.783
WHERE WE SEE THE SHORTAGES ARE

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.185
IN THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.954
WORLD- NURSING. BUT THAT HAS

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:21.357
NOTHING TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:23.592
US DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:24.793
NURSING SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.997
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE NURSES THAT

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.265
USUALLY STATE. WITHIN FIFTY

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.634
MILES OR SO ON THE PLACES THAT

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.536
THE GRADUATE WHAT THAT HAS TO

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:34.904
DO IS WITH THE INSTITUTIONS

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.473
BEING ABLE TO RECRUIT NURSES.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.707
TO COME AND LIVE IN TO SOME OF

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.744
THOSE AREAS. WHEN YOU SEE A

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.378
SERVICE THAT SAME SHORT IN THE

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:43.646
THOSE ISOLATE AREAS APPLY TO

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.714
OTHER AREAS OF HEALTHCARE.

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:48.384
POSITIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE-

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.653
IS THAT THE- SAME TYPE OF AN

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.754
ISSUE IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.155
HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS IS THAT WE

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.456
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS IN

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.891
CERTAIN PLACES A CALIFORNIA.

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.192
ABSOLUTELY I WOULDN'T TRY TO

01:09:57.259 --> 01:09:58.327
SPEAK FROM THE DOCTORS BUT I

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.461

PRACTITIONERS I KNOW THAT WE

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:03.032
ALWAYS LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:04.600
MOST OF THOSE AREAS USE NURSE

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:05.701
PRACTITIONERS BECAUSE THEY

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:08.437
CANNOT RECRUIT DOCTORS. TO BE

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:10.472
THERE AND BECAUSE OF THAT-

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:12.374
THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.643
NURSES TO BE TOOK TO BECAUSE

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.778
THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.847
pTHEN THEY BECOME REGISTERED

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:21.417

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:22.551
IS THERE THOSE NURSE

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:23.686

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.462

EARLIER WITH THE CONSULTANTS.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.228
AT PLANETARY SIDE I THINK THERE

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.963
ARE A FEW AREAS WHERE THEY'RE

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.767
NOT ACCURATE OR- THERE. IS SO

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.835
WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:33.869
QUESTIONS ARE ASKED THAT YOU'RE

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.971

ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS-

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.775
I WILL SAY THAT. THIS TO POINT

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.277
OUT A COUPLE- ONE OR JUST ONE

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.746
THE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.048
COMPACT ARE DONE BY THE FEDERAL

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:48.183
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION THE FBI

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.618
SO. I WE WERE WORK WITH

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.286
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE.

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.722
PRETTY HEIST FOR. A WHO IS

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.458
APPROVED TO BE A NURSE- IN

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:59.528
THIRTY FOUR STATES AND

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.495
CALIFORNIA. THIS TO THE

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.129
CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING ENOUGH

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:04.366
NURSES. THERE WAS TWO FOLD ONE

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.100
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PRODUCING

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.335
ENOUGH WAS THE STATEMENT BY MS

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:09.538
HARRIS SO IF THAT'S ACCURATE

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:12.007
THEN WE HAVE NURSES THAT COULD

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:13.342
HELP THE OTHER THIRTY FOUR

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:15.510
STATES GIVES THEM. AN UP TO BE

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.246
EMPLOYED. IT ALSO GIVES AN

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:18.447
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HEALTH

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:19.381
WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.783
PROVIDES THE AUTHORITY TO HELP

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.385
THOSE I UNDERSERVED

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.254
COMMUNITIES WERE. YOU KNOW

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.788
WE'RE HAVING ISSUES WE DON'T

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.657
HAVE ENOUGH HOSPITALS DON'T

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:31.093
HAVE ENOUGH CLINICS. SO THE

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.195
OTHER POINT WAS THAT. MANY

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.396
NURSES HAVE BEEN LAID OFF

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.597
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THAT'S

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.200
BECAUSE WE PUT AFTER HOSPITALS

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.368
IN OUR MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.836
JUST TO FOCUS ON ONE THING

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:44.306
WE'VE WE'VE MADE. SO MANY

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.642
HOSPITALS IN FACT JUST FOCUSED

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.843
ON PAVILION NOTHING ELSE

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.478
NOTHING OPTIONAL NO OPTIONAL

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:50.979
SURGERIES NOTHING ELSE IS SOLD

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.314
WE WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF BEEN

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.384
DECIMATING A- A PROFESSION THAT

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.551
WE NEED TO PUT THAT BACK

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.319
TOGETHER BUT THAT'S A

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.087
DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME.

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:00.856
MISTER CHAIR THE NURSE

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:03.325
LICENSURE COMPACT HAS BEEN

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.460
FUNCTIONING FOR TWENTY YEARS.

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.029
NEW JERSEY ADJUST TO PROVE

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:10.065
THEIR LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:10.632
PROBABLY IN THE NICK OF TIME

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.234

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.536
OF NURSES TO NEW JERSEY TO A

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.271
DEAL WITH THE COKE AT NINETEEN.

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.241
A PANDEMIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.709
CONCERNS RAISED THE CONSULTANTS

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.277
THOROUGH ANALYSIS CAN BE

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.745
RESOLVED I BELIEVE THROUGH THE

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:25.314
AWARENESS. THAT THIS

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.382
OPPORTUNITY IS OPTIONAL OR WITH

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.984

WE'RE NOT JUST. CREATING AN

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:49.064
ARTIFICIAL BARRIER BUT ONE THAT

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.166

MANY YEARS ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.485
IT TAKES. FOR A NURSE WHO HAS

PRACTICED IN ANOTHER STATE TO

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.855
COME HERE AND PRACTICE- IS

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.123

COMPLETED- ON TIME- THAT BOARD

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:34.676
TO GO OUT OF EXISTENCE SO

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:35.510
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. TO

WE ARE CREATING ARTIFICIAL

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:04.539
BARRIERS- THAT LIMIT THE ACCESS

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:05.340

AND DAY ON THE MAYBE LIABILITY

03:15:39.894 --> 03:15:40.762
ISSUES ARE THINGS THAT PREVENT

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:42.430
VETERINARIANS FROM DOING THAT.

THAT ROLE BUT PERHAPS THE MOST

03:15:52.907 --> 03:15:53.775
IMPORTANT THING IS THE FIRST

03:15:53.842 --> 03:15:54.776

DOCTOR PAN REALLY APPRECIATE IT

03:16:18.500 --> 03:16:20.535
CONFUSION ABOUTTHE- BROAD

03:16:20.602 --> 03:16:22.537
APPLICATION OF THE BILL. I

03:16:22.604 --> 03:16:24.506
THINK THE NON PRESCRIPTION

03:16:24.572 --> 03:16:26.441
ELEMENT WILL BE- IF WE TIGHTEN

03:16:26.508 --> 03:16:28.376
THAT UP THAT WILL BE VERY

03:16:28.443 --> 03:16:30.545
HELPFUL TO CDMA. YOUR POINT IS

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:33.414
WELL TAKEN THOUGH DOCTOR PAN- I

03:16:33.481 --> 03:16:37.085
THINK WHERE- THE CDMA WOULD BE.

03:16:37.152 --> 03:16:39.354
MORE COMFORTABLE IS IF THERE

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:41.122
WAS SOME APPROPRIATE TRAINING

03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:42.991
FOR SHELTER STAFF I KNOW THE

03:16:43.057 --> 03:16:43.758
SPONSORS ARE WORKING ON THAT

03:16:43.825 --> 03:16:46.027
COMPONENT I KNOW THAT THE-

03:16:46.094 --> 03:16:47.629
BEING ON THAT COMPONENT. A

03:16:47.695 --> 03:16:48.596
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW

03:16:48.663 --> 03:16:50.131
AS A SPECIES SUCH AS BORDER

03:16:50.198 --> 03:16:52.534
COLLIES COULD DIE IF GIVEN-

03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.269
IVERMECTIN AND SO WE JUST WANT

03:16:54.335 --> 03:16:57.205

03:16:57.272 --> 03:16:58.873
TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS HAVE

03:16:58.940 --> 03:16:59.741
BEEN PUT IN PLACE. ON YOUR

03:16:59.807 --> 03:17:01.543

03:17:03.611 --> 03:17:05.613
PERFORMING THIS ROLE. ALSO A

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:07.649
VERY GOOD QUESTION A CDMA HAS

03:17:07.715 --> 03:17:09.017
BEEN WORKING WITH CAUGHT WHAT

03:17:09.083 --> 03:17:11.186

03:17:11.252 --> 03:17:13.388
OPPORTUNITIES. YOU KNOW WHERE

03:17:13.454 --> 03:17:15.590

03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:20.061

03:17:20.128 --> 03:17:20.895
THAT RESPECT THEY ARE DOING

03:17:20.962 --> 03:17:23.965
THAT I THINK THE LIABILITIES

03:17:24.032 --> 03:17:27.468

03:17:27.535 --> 03:17:28.236
