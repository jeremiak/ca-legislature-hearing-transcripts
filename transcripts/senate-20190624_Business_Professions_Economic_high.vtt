00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:46.672
OR ANY APPROPRIATE POSITION.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:47.539
IT IS AN ACCEPTED TOOL AN

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.508
ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY WHERE BY LIVE

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:51.443

THE USE OF FLORA SKIPPY.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.320
I'VE HANDED OUT X. RAYS THAT

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.455
SHOW WHAT YOU CAN SEE WHILE

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.524
USING FLUOROSCOPY.

PATIENT IS RELATIVELY IMMOBILE.

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:12.531
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE BONDS

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:13.231
ARE WELL ALIGNED IN THREE

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:14.766
DIMENSIONS AND THEN THAT THE

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.234
MULTIPLE PIECES OF HARDWARE ARE

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.402
PROBABLY PLACED WITHOUT

THE FRACTURE.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.040
THIS ISN'T DONE WHILE THE BONES

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.675
CAN FAIL TO HEAL OR HE'LL IN THE

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:26.578

MORBIDITY TO THE PATIENT.

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.817
THE PROBLEM THAT A BEFORE SEVEN

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:32.918
ADDRESSES WHEN ORTHOPEDIC

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:34.019

WHICH CAN OFTEN TAKE SIX MONTHS.

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.776
NOT HAVING THE FLORA SKIPPY

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:58.877
CERTIFICATE PREVENTS THE SURGEON

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.113
FROM TAKING EMERGENCY ROOM CALL

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:03.014

PATIENT CARE.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:08.987
PLUS TO BE IT IS POTENTIALLY

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.889
DANGEROUS THAT IS WHY DOCTORS

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.457
SUCH AS ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS WHO

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.391

RADIATION DURING THE SURGERY.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:26.438
THAT'S WHY EVERYONE WORKING IN

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.039
THE OPERATING ROOM THAT IS USING

PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:30.268
FLUOROSCOPY IS A GOOD TOOL FOR

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.070
THE SURGEONS TO EVALUATE THE

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.339
FRACTURE BEFORE THEY OPEN UP THE

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:36.374

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:42.046
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.414
BEEN RAISED I'M SURE THAT'S A

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.482
LIKE THE QUESTION FOR MY

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:45.883
COLLEAGUES.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.952
WELL I THINK OF I APPRECIATE THE

00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:49.286
FACT THE INDUSTRIES HERE AND

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:52.123
THAT THEY DID NOT COORDINATED

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.457
ANNE'S SAYS THEY HAVE.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:54.892
OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPLIANCE

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.060
ISSUES AND I'M HEARING FROM

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:58.662
COOLEY BUT THEY'RE SORT OF WANT

00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.230
TO SAY WE ALREADY DO IT THE

00:39:59.296 --> 00:39:59.964
OTHER ONE SAYS WE CAN'T DO IT

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.166
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED THINGS.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.101
ARE.

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.002
I'LL JUST HAVE A STANDPOINT OF

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:09.006
ON A I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT.

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.407
PROVIDE AN ELECTRONIC RECORD

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.275
THAT ALONG FOR SOME SHE CAN PULL

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:12.476
DOWN.

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.611
THE DOCUMENTS WHAT THEY'RE GOING

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:14.678
TO FIND THE VEHICLE.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.447
I THINK THAT SUPPORTS A TYPE OF

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.748
ACCOUNTABILITY IS IT HERE IN

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:18.816
CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC WOULD

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:19.583
SUPPORT.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.752
I THINK IT MAKES FOR EASIER

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.187
ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN LAW

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.121
ENFORCEMENT AND DELIVERY DRIVER

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:24.421
[inaudible]

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:27.625
ON I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:29.627
TALK WITH FOLKS BUT I ACTUALLY.

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:34.198
OF WHEN I LOOK AT THE STATUTE.

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.867
THERE IS NOT THE PARTICULARITY

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.435
AS TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:41.472
VEHICLE -- THERE'S BEEN ADDED BY

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.008
THIS LEDGER -- I AM I WILL SAY

00:40:44.074 --> 00:40:45.543
I'M NOT WEDDED TO A PARTICULAR

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.711
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION AS TO HOW

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:51.048
THE WHAT LEDGER GETS -- CONVEYED

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.449
MADE AVAILABLE.

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:55.252
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.755
FAVOR ONE MODALITY OVER ANOTHER.

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.890
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.026
SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITH

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:04.762
THIS TRANSFER AROUND THE STATE.

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:05.696
VERY GOOD THAT I AND I GUESS

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.464
ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ONE SOLUTION

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.466
WOULD BE JUST TO CURTAIL

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.468
DELIVERIES RIGHT IT IS WITH AND

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.903
THE DELIVERIES YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.508
ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES AFTER.

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:18.742
THERE'S PROBABLY PROPONENTS FOR

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:19.343
THAT VIEW SURE THAT THERE ARE

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.211
SOME PRETTY SERIOUS PRODUCT TO

HI IN VEHICLES AROUND OUR

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:22.780
NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S NOT SO

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.281
DIFFERENT THAN ALCOHOL OR OTHER

00:41:24.348 --> 00:41:25.549
THINGS THAT ARE SENSITIVE IN OUR

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.318

THE CONCERNED ABOUT -- SOMEHOW

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:32.723
THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NOT THERE

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:37.127

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:37.962
AND I'M SURPRISED ME YEAH.

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:39.263
IF I MAY I THINK WORKERS I THINK

WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.165
CLOSE THE LOOP MAKES A LOT OF

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:41.966
SENSE TO ME.

AND BUT I ASSUME YOU'LL CONTINUE

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.739
TO WORK WITH THAT.

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:50.541
THE OPPONENTS WHO ARE HERE TODAY

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:51.675
TO TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN WORK

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:52.943
THROUGH THEIR ISSUES IS THE BILL

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.478
WAS FORWARD.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.880
INDEED I WILL AND I WANT TO SAY

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.882
YOU KNOW FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES

00:41:57.948 --> 00:41:59.283

DISCUSSED OUR BILL WITH YOUR

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:02.920
PREDECESSORS THE MEDICAL BILLS.

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:04.188
I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN ON THE

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:07.858
ACCESS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:08.592
FOLKS WHO NEED.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.494
I THINK THAT IN IN THE BIG RUSH

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:11.495
TO RECREATIONAL.

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:12.830
I SORT OF FEEL WE STEP BACKWARDS

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.465
A LITTLE BIT IN LETTING FOLKS

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:14.965
FOR WHOM.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.367
THERE'S A MEDIC MEDICALLY

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:18.269
INDICATED USE AND I THINK THE

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.104
AFFORDABLE AND EASE OF ACCESS TO

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.373
THAT POPULATION IS EXTREMELY

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:22.673
IMPORTANT.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.576

FAVOR ROLLING AWAY DELIVERY I

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.646
THINK IT ACTUALLY PLAYS AN

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:29.747
IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:31.248
BUT I WOULD REMEMBER THOSE FOLKS

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:32.983
ARE MOST FOR HOMELESS THERE'S A

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.085

FROM THE A COG WEBSITE SAYS THAT

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.488
THEY RECOMMEND THAT -- PATIENTS

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.723
HAVE THEIR FIRST EXAM BETWEEN

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.625
THE AGES OF TIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:31.328
I'M THAT IS MUCH YOUNGER THAN

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:33.130
WHAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS IN.

00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:37.134
THE EXAM ROOM -- MY CONCERN THE

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.169
IF A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT IS

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:41.238

PAMPHLET TO THEIR PATIENTS --

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.145
MANY MANY OF DOCTOR GEORGE

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:50.147
TYNDALE'S PATIENTS CLAIM THAT HE

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:51.681
DID NOT GIVE THEM A DRIP COUGH.

00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:55.051
AND THAT HE DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE --

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.420
SO I ASKED THE QUESTION WHY

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:58.789
WOULD HE MAKE SURE THAT HIS

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:01.758
FRONT OFFICE STAFF WAS --

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.427

INFORMATIONAL POUND FAT PAMPHLET.

00:51:05.695 --> 00:51:06.496
AND THEN WHAT IS FURTHER

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:08.432
ALARMING IS THAT HE WAS ALLOWED

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.833
TO BUY U. S. C. TO QUIETLY

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.402
RESIGN WITH A FINANCIAL PAY OUT

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.237
AND FREE OF ANY SPOT OR BLEMISH.

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:16.006
TO HIS MEDICAL LICENSE WITH HE

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:18.141
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD THIS

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:19.810
DESPITE COUNTLESS COMPLAINTS

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:21.445
MADE BY VARIOUS PATIENTS.

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:23.680
AND CHAPERONES TO VOICE CONCERN

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.715
TO THEIR SUPERVISORS WINDOWS

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:26.917
PRACTICES WERE INAPPROPRIATE.

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.518
THEIR VOICES WERE NOT ENOUGH AND

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.520
AS YOU CAN SEE IT ISN'T ENOUGH

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.322
TO HAVE A CHAPERONE IN THE ROOM --

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.824
OR TO TRY STE -- THE

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.426

WITH -- OF YOU KNOW I'M.

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:45.202
IN INAPPROPRIATE -- DOCTOR -- I

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.837
BELIEVE THAT A SIGNATURE

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:47.771
REQUIREMENT WOULD HAVE ADDED

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:49.172
ANOTHER LAYER OF ACCOUNTABILITY

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.540
ON USC'S ADMINISTRATORS TO

THE STATUE THAT THIS BILL AMENDS

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.823
ALREADY REQUIRES PHYSICIANS TO

PROVIDE INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLETS

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.492

MY FEARS THAT THE SIGNATURE

KNOW IF THIS WAS CLEARED AND

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.858

WOMEN THAT ARE GOING TO FIRST

TIME GOT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:05.661
THE REASON WHY WE'RE WE'RE

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:06.529
ADDING.

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.464
THE SIGNATURE AS WE WANT THE WE

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.532
WANT TO PROVIDE AS MUCH

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.900
CERTAINTY AS POSSIBLE.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.235
GIVEN THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:13.736
SOMEBODY TO READ SOMETHING EVEN

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.238
IF IT PASSED THE FATE A STATE

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.105
LAW SOMEBODY CAN RESULT IN

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.006
WHETHER NOT WHAT WHETHER THEY

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:17.907
CHOOSE TO OR NOT.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.675
BUT THE GOAL IS BY ADDING THE

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.077
REQUIREMENT OF THE SIGNATURE YOU

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.378
CREATE A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.147
THE LEAST REVIEW AND LOOK AT THE

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.248
INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.516
PROVIDED TO THEM.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.784
IN REVIEWING THAT INFORMATION

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.319
YOU'RE NOT WAVING YOUR RIGHT TO

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.422
SUE LATER IF YOU ARE -- TAKEN

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:35.658
ADVANTAGE OF BUT WHAT WE WANT TO

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:36.392
DO IS CREATE A SAID I MEAN LOOK

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:36.993
AT WAY OUT WE WANT TO CREATE A

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:37.860
SITUATION WE CAN PROVIDE

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.228
INFORMATION AND THE STATE SHOULD

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.296
BE THE ONE PROVIDING THAT IN OR

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.266
REQUIRING THAT THAT INFORMATION

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.567
BE PROVIDED.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.268
WE'RE ALL.

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:45.902
BUSY IN OUR LIVES WE GO TO THE

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.303
DOCTOR'S OFFICE WE GETHANDED A

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.805
LOT OF THINGS THINGS THAT WERE

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.174
NOT REQUIRED TO SIGN AND THINGS.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.075
BECAUSE WE DON'T THERE'S NO

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:52.975
REQUIREMENT WE REALLY PROBABLY

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.510
DON'T READ AND DON'T PAY ANY

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:56.412
ATTENTION TO SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.082
DO IS CREATE A SITUATION WHERE

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.316
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT ANY

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.884
ONEROUS ON THAT PATIENT WILL

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.219
WERE TRYING TO DO IS.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.421
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER THE MORE

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:06.522
INFORMATION YOU CAN GO INTO A

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.357
SITUATION WITH THE BETTER YOU

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.626
CAN BE PROTECTED IT'S NOT LIKE

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.928
WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.297
THE EN EL A DOCTOR IS MORE.

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.965
THIS IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.300
GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IT IT CAN

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.201
HAPPEN.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:20.269
AND SELL BECAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:21.471
THE STATE REALLY HAS A

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:24.340
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE SOME

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:25.942
TYPE OF REQUIREMENT IN LAW THAT

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:27.376
THERE BE.

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:28.277
THE GREATEST LIKELIHOOD AS

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:29.312
POSSIBLE BECAUSE PATIENTS CAN

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.379
REVIEW THE INFORMATION SO THAT

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:31.380
THEY CAN AT LEAST PROTECT

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:32.648
THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE GOING IT

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:33.449
ALONE.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.851
AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.652
GOING IN WITH THE PREDATOR OR

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:39.021
NOT AND THAT'S WHY.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:39.689
I AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD I

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:40.356
WOULD I WOULD ADD ONE THING SO I

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.023
THINK IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.425
THAT THERE WAS NO PRECEDENT. FOR

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.993
REQUIRING A SIGNATURE ON ANY

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.928
FORMS THAT ARE GIVEN I WOULD SAY

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:46.796
THAT.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.899
THERE REALLY IS NO PRECEDENT FOR

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.134
WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED WHICH IS

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.104
IN A GYNECOLOGIST WHO HAVE

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.707
ABUSED. SEVEN HUNDRED WOMEN AND

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:57.974
COUNTING.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.942
AND SO IN MY MIND THE REASON FOR

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:01.410
REQUIRING THE SIGNATURE.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.546
IS NOT TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.014
WOMAN WHO'S RECEIVING NAPA TO

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.216
PUT THE ONUS ON THE POTENTIALLY

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.351
PREDATORY DOCTOR.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:10.253
WHO'S PASSING OUT THIS FORM

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.555
RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.322
IN THE STATE TELLS YOU TO PASS

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:14.757
OUT A FORM YOU'RE GONNA PASS OUT

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:15.358
THE FORM.

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.792
IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.261
MOLESTING SEVEN HUNDRED WOMEN

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.896
GUESS WHAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.097
PASS OUT THE FORM.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.065
SO IN MY MIND IT'S ABOUT MAKING

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.368
SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY GET THIS

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.536
IN FRONT OF THE WOMEN WHO NEED

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.004
IT AND I WOULD JUST ALSO

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:28.771
REITERATE.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.940
THAT NOTHING ABOUT THE SIGNATURE

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:31.707
SAYS.

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.377
AND I RECEIVED AN EXAMINATION

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.811
THAT.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:38.014
THAT WAS THIS IT SIMPLY SAYS I

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.716
ACKNOWLEDGE I WAS GIVEN THIS

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.218
INFORMATION BY MY DOCTOR.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.853
WHICH I AGREE WITH ALL THAT AND

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.288
THE MORE INFORMATION THE BETTER

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.356
I TOTALLY AGREE -- IF YOU DON'T

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:48.658
GROW UP IN A HOME WHERE YOU'RE

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:49.959
GIVEN INFORMATION ARE YOU DON'T

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.594
GROW UP WITH A MOTHER WHO TELLS

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.828
YOU WHAT THE EXAM IS GOING TO BE

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:53.196
LIKE.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:55.231
BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:56.465
LABOR MOVEMENT FOR TWENTY YEARS

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.134
BUT PEOPLE SIGN SOMETHING AT

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:00.269
WORK EVEN IF IT IS JUST SAYING

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.470
THAT THEY RECEIVED IT.

01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:03.973
EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT LATER ON

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.942
THEY THINK I DID SOMETHING WRONG

01:04:06.008 --> 01:04:07.944
THEY WON'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.413
THEY THINK I SIGN AWAY MY RIGHTS.

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.315
AND YOU WE CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:14.517
THEY DIDN'T WE CAN TELL PEOPLE

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:15.952
THAT IT'S JUST YOUR CITING THAT

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.220
YOU JUST LIKE A TRAFFIC TICKET

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:18.287
WHEN YOU SIGN IT YOU'RE NOT

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.889
ADMITTING TO GUILT YOU'RE JUST

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:20.723
SAYING THAT YOU RECEIVED IT.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.024
BROWN ABOUT ALL OF YOU BUT I DID

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.759
KNOW THAT FOR YEARS I THOUGHT

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.795
THAT WHEN I THAT'S I'VE HAD THAT

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:31.133
MAY TRAFFIC TICKETS BUT IF I DID.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:31.767
BUT I JUST THINK THAT I WOULD I

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:32.401
READ I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.669
TO DO BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.771
SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE NO IDEA

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.406
THAT WHAT THESE DOCTORS ARE

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.208
DOING ARE A JUST AND THAT'S

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:39.875
WRONG.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.044
AND AGAINST THE LAW BUT I REALLY

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.613
DO HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE EARNS

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:45.615
ABOUT THE SIGNATURE I DON'T KNOW

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.417
THAT IT HELPS IT ANYMORE -- I

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:49.252
WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.186
I'M HEADED SEVEN THE DOCTOR'S

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.787
OFFICE AND I SIGNED IT I READ

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:52.622
ALL OF IT.

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:55.558
I DON'T WE'RE ALL IN IN A HURRY.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.827
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT MAKES.

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.996
A WOMAN READ IT ANYMORE -- IF

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:01.564
SHE HAS TO SIGN IT AND IF SHE

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:02.531
DOESN'T.

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.033
SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.801
IS IF YOU CAN REALLY LOOK AT

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.870
THAT BECAUSE FROM TWENTY YEARS

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.372
OF EXPERIENCE PEOPLE SIGNING

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.339
DOCUMENTS.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.574
AND THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.075
SIGNED THEIR RIGHTS AWAY AND I

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:14.877
AM WORRIED -- IT WITH THE

HAVE. TO TO EXPLORE AND I DON'T

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.254
THINK THAT.

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:02.825
I IN THE PAMPHLET.

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:05.494

SOMETHING A I ALSO AGREE WITH

01:11:12.701 --> 01:11:14.903
WITH DOCTOR PAN THAT -- AS A

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.405
YOUNG PERSON THEY MAY THINK --

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.140
I'M JUST SIGNING THIS THING BUT

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.009
WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN SO IS

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:23.112
THIS HOW THE THE EXAM SUPPOSED

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.647
TO GO I MEAN I THINK IT CAUSES A

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.116
LOT OF CONFUSION -- ESPECIALLY

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:31.253
AS A WOMAN -- HAVING GONE

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.388
THROUGH HEALTH EXAMS IT'S NOT

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.423
EVERY EXAM IS THE SAME.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.091
AND THE PROCESS IS NEVER GOING

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.192
TO BE THE SAME.

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.061
BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.629

BE TALKING YOU THROUGH AS TO

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.068
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.270
EXACTLY WHY THEY'RE DOING IT I

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:51.306
THINK THAT IN TERMS OF A MORE --

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:54.977
TAILORED -- METHOD OF CARE IS

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.046
BETTER THAN JUST A YOU KNOW.

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.747
HALF WITH THAT I DON'T THINK

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.482
REALLY GETS THE NEEDED PROBLEM

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.017
THAT'S THAT'S MY PERCEPTION I AM

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.787
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.422
SIGNATURE ASPECT BECAUSE THAT

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:07.556
MADE COURAGE SOME YOUNG WOMEN

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.826
WHO HAD EXPERIENCE -- DOCTORS

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.428
WHO ARE NOT DOING THE RIGHT

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:13.429
THING.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.297
THEY MAY THINK OKAY WELL I FIND

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:16.598
SOMETHING I DON'T THINK I CAN

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.033
COME FORWARD NOW I WISH I HAD

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.768
READ.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.670
YOU KNOW WHATEVER THIS.

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:23.605
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND SO SO I

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.274
DO HAVE CONCERNS AND I'M HOPING

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.608
THAT THE AUTHOR CAN.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:29.278
WORK THROUGH THAT OF WITH THE

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:32.681
OPPOSITION ON A FIND SOME.

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.216
SOME OTHER WAY.

EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT OPINIONS

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.126
AND AND MINE IS IS DIFFERENT

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:44.760
THAN THE ONES YOU'VE JUST HEARD

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.261

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.497
THE SIGNATURE.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.899
I THINK THAT -- IT'S JUST SINCE

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:53.202
YOU'VE INDICATED ONLY.

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:55.237
SIGNIFIES THAT YOU RECEIVE THE

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:57.506
PAMPHLET -- AND THERE IS A

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.541
PRECEDENT I HAVE LEGISLATION TO

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.210
YEARS AGO IF A DOCTOR IS ON

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:03.712
PROBATION FOR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:06.815
SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR OTHER THINGS

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.083
THEY HAVE TO GIVE.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.719
THAT INFORMATION TO THE PATIENT.

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.221
AND THE PATIENT HAS TO SIGNED

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:14.256
RECEIPT OF THAT INFORMATION SO

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:17.092
THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.261
AND THE OTHER PART THAT I FIND

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.629
IF YOU TRUST IN THE POSITION OF

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:23.632
DOCTOR TYNDALL WHO WE KNOW

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.467
VIOLATED SO MANY WOMEN.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.103
THAT HE GAVE THIS INFORMATION TO

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.037
THEM.

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.973

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.142
WOULD NOTED AND PROBABLY NOT DO

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:35.110
IT AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.478
AND THEY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.780
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.448
INFORMATION THAT I THINK.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.383
IS CRUCIAL FOR AN UNDERSTANDING

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.950

SIGNATURE IS JUST.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.892
WHAT IT IS?

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:50.926
A KNOWLEDGE MINT OF RECEIPT OF A

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:51.894

AROUND THE TABLE TODAY.

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.442
BUT THE SO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:07.910
TO MEET WITH YOU -- ASSEMBLY

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:09.678

SIDES OF THE MATTER -- PRIOR TO

THIS HEARING AND FIRST I

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.218
APPRECIATE THAT THE CONCERNS

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.219
THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT THE

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.954
PHRASE UNDERSTAND SIGNED THAT

YOU'VE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.393
THAT FUNCTION OF UNDERSTANDING

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.661
IS GONNA BE INTERPRETED

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:26.628
DIFFERENTLY AND THAT YOU'VE

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.096
AGREED AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:29.598
TO LEAD TO DELETE THAT THAT

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.400
REQUIREMENT.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:32.634
AND I THINK THAT WAS HELPFUL.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.203
AND SECONDLY THE CONCERNS THAT

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.304
WE HAVE BEEN RAISED BY MY

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:37.739
FRIENDS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:38.640
ABOUT THE BURDEN ON THE DOCTOR

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.142
OF OF ACTUALLY.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.077
GETTING THIS PERSONALLY FROM

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.145
EACH PATIENT.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.379
THAT YOU'VE ELIMINATED THAT

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.647
REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO REQUIRE

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.916
THAT THE OFFICE THE FIRST VISIT

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.085
REQUIREMENTS NOT HEY AN ANNUAL

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.053
REQUIREMENT.

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.120
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.255
CONSTRUCTIVE STEP FORWARD IN

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.323
TRYING.

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:55.757
TO GET TO THE PROBLEM THAT

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:56.859
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO WITHOUT

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.493
PLACING MORE BURDENS ON THE

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.828
POSITION THEMSELVES.

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:00.996
THAT IT COULD BE DONE WITHIN THE

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.431
OFFICE ENVIRONMENT [inaudible]

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:07.202
AND THIRDLY WHAT.

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:08.537
IS TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:09.471
MEDICAL BOARD.

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:11.607
WHICH IS A PEER SUPPORTED

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.609
ENGAGEMENT TO GET THOSE WHO HAVE

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.910
THAT.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.913
THE EXPERIENCE I TO TO WRITE

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.481
THIS THEN PROVIDED TO ALL THE

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.782
PHYSICIANS I THOUGHT AS A VERY

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.184
CONSTRUCTIVE STEP FOR THOSE WHO

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.485
WORRY ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:25.320
MIGHT BE USED FOR THE

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:25.854
DESCRIPTIONS THAT MIGHT BE

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.223
OFFERED -- GIVEN THAT DIVERSITY

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.292
OF FOLKS -- HAVING THIS

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.593
PROCEDURE AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.296
THEIR LIFE -- I ALSO THOUGHT

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.030
THAT THAT WAS A VERY

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:36.465
CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT THAT

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.066
WASN'T TRYING TO SAY THIS IS

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.868
WHAT YOU MUST DO -- IT'S REALLY

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.003
TRYING TO SAY THOSE WHO ARE THE

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:43.105
PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD HELP

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.640
TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY COME UP

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:45.908
WITH WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:50.746
DESCRIBE THESE THINGS -- AND I I

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.814
A I AM SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE OF

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:56.451
THE SIGNATURE AND BUT I GUESS

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:58.887
WHAT -- WHAT WAS PERSUASIVE TO

01:15:58.954 --> 01:15:59.888
ME IS THAT?

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:02.291
LOOK AT THE STATUS QUO TODAY.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.026
THERE IS NO SIGNATURE THERE IS

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:05.327
NO PAMPHLET.

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.195
A WOMEN HAVE -- I HAVE -- FELT

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:08.664
THAT IT WAS ALL THEIR FAULT FOR

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.399
YEARS WHERE THEY DIDN'T COME

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:12.634
FORWARD -- BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.703
THAT -- IT WAS THEM WHATEVER THE

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:15.971
REASON VERY AND REPAIR IS

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.439
REASONS ARE.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.640
I'D THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.509
CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY.

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.244
AND IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:23.879
WITH YOUR LEGISLATION TO TRY TO

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.981
MAKE IT BETTER. TO TRY TO FIND A

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:27.316
AND AN AVENUE THAT COULD PREVENT

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:29.051
THESE PREDATORS FROM UNDERTAKING

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.453
THEIR THEIR WORK. FOR ME THE

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.055
SIGNATURE OF RECEIPT SEEM LIKE A

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.790
A MODEST STEP FORWARD WITHOUT A

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:35.857
BIG BURDEN ON THE MEDICAL

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:37.459
OFFICES THAT WOULD PERHAPS

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:38.860
PERHAPS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:39.795
NOW.

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.730
A POTENTIALLY COULD COULD MAKE A

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.165
POSITION WHO WAS A PREDATOR

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:45.200
THINK TWICE ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.201
GOING TO DO.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.536
AND SO IT IT'S WITH THAT BROADER

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:49.037
UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK AND

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.906
THE GOALS THAT YOU BOTH HAVE --

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:51.940
AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.909
TAKEN THAT MAKE THE BILL FOR ME

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:55.544
AN APPROPRIATE ONE TO MOVE

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.278
FORWARD TODAY.

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.546
SO THAT'S THAT'S MY THOUGHT ON

01:16:57.612 --> 01:16:59.448
THE MATTER ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:00.782

IMAGINE THEM GOING THROUGH THAT.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.577
BUT IF THERE'D BEEN SOMETHING ON

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.212
THE TABLE THAT EVEN FOR A SECOND

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.514
THEY WOULD LOOK AND MAYBE THINK

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.282
AND WALK AWAY OR MAYBE THINK OR

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.884

IT IS SOMETHING THAT -- MIGHT BE

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.763
A LITTLE SCARY BUT AT THE SAME

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:41.983
FIND SOMETHING.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.251
THAT JUST MEANT THAT THEY

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:44.886
RECEIVED IT AND THOUSANDS OF

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:46.121
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.923
WRONG AND THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:50.125
SIGNED AWAY THEIR RIGHTS -- I

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.860
DON'T THINK THE SIGNATURE HURTS

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:54.529
ANYONE EXCEPT THE PATIENT I'M A

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:55.630
LAYOFF TODAY.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:56.698
AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN DO

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.366
SOMETHING BECAUSE INFORMATION IS

01:18:58.433 --> 01:18:59.334
GREAT.

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.436
THE PAMPHLET THE INFORMATION I

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.438
LOVE ALL OF THAT BECAUSE I

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.140
STATED BEFORE A LOT HAS TO WILL

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.308
GROW UP IN FAMILIES WHERE THEIR

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.076
MOM OR SOMEONE TALKS TO THEM

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.478
ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT.

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.979
BUT I JUST FEEL THAT THE

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:13.181
SIGNATURE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:14.850
HOLD THE DOCTOR ACCOUNTABLE I AM

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.318
WORRIED THAT IT IS GOING TO HARM

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.854
THE PATIENT BECAUSE LATER THAT

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.021
WOMAN WHO MAY HAVE BEEN.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:22.524
SERIOUSLY INJURED OR MOLESTED OR

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.192
WORSE IS GOING TO THINK THAT SHE

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.561
SIGNED HER RIGHTS AWAY BY

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.763

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.412
JUST THINK THAT THE PERSON MORE

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:46.581
HARMING IS THE PATIENT SO I HOPE

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:47.849
WE CAN WORK ON THAT.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.284

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:54.422
