I'D LIKE TO WELCOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM DEPARTMENT WHO ARE PARTICIPATE REMOTELY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT THE ITEM. FOUR THE MORE YOU WORK ON THE ROAD FROM THE FINANCE AND- AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA OF THE VISION IS THAT THE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS AND LOANS FOR VERY SPECIAL FUNDS TO HELP. SOUNDS JENNIFER. THREE TRANSPORTATION TRASPORTATION- ALONE TWENTY ONE MILLION FROM THE LOCAL AIRPORT LET ME COUNT- ONCE I TRANSFER A HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS. STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT AT ONE TIME TRANSFER THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION THE FUND. THESE MEASURES ARE. THE PRODUCT I DON'T SEE THE STATE BUDGET. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. BUT FOR TRANSPORTATION YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. NO SIR WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ADD. THE LA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS YOU HAVE A COMMENT. GOOD MORNING SENATORS CAN HEAR ME YES- FRANK JIMENEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN REGARDS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNT. THE GENERAL FUND AND WE JUST LIKE THE COMMENT THAT ARTICLE NINETEEN OFTHE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION GENERALLY PROHIBITS REVENUES FROM THE GASOLINE AND DIESEL EXCISE TAXES. FROM BEING USED FOR- NON TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES- HOWEVER ARTICLE NINETEEN THAT'S AND- EXPLICITLY LIMIT THE INTEREST- EARNED PUT ON THOSE REVENUES WHILE THEY SIT IN THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. AND THAT HAS OUT THAT IS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED THIS TRANSFER TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A TRANSFER LIKE THIS FROM INTEREST HAS BEEN USED. SO THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEDENT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS TRANSFER- THAT'S WHAT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE- SEEK A MORE FORMAL LEGAL OPINION FROM LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. AND ALSO POLICY QUESTION AT HAND- IF THE TRANSFER IS COMPLETED- UNTIL TOMORROW EVENING- BUT SPENDING ON HIGHWAY PROJECTS. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THIS A STAFF RECOMMENDATION NOTES THAT THAT TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF TO COUNT- CONSIST OF THE REMAINING BALANCES OF THE PHONES ARE TRIVIAL TO THE ORIGINAL GENERAL FUND TRANSFER. AND THAT TO NEED SOME LEGAL CLARIFICATIONS A STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO. IS TO HOLD THE MATTER OPEN. VERY GOOD OKAY THE CENTER BAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE IN REGARDS TO THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION TRANSFER FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNT TO THE GENERAL FUND THE BOTTOM LINE FOR ME IS THIS THIS GOES AGAINST A PROMISE A PROMISE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE AND IN THE THEN GOVERNOR- IT MADE IN PROP SIXTY NINE. THAT REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE WHETHER IT'S DIRECT FROM THE GAS TAX THEIR INTERESTS ITSELF THAT IS FROM THE GAS TAX WOULD BE SPENT ON ROAD IMPROVEMENT IN HIGHWAY PROJECTS I THINK THIS IS A BROKEN PROMISE A BROKEN PROMISE IF THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MOVES FORWARD WITH THIS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE GAS TAX IS DOWN BY APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED MILLION WHICH WE KNOW IS GOING TO IMPACT ROAD IMPROVEMENT HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENT IN BRIDGE MODERNIZATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE I BELIEVE THAT THIS MONEY COULD BE BETTER SPENT ON THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED FIXING THE ROADS OF CALIFORNIANS. CENTER DOLLY. HEY RICHARD SHARED I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND SENATE DISTRICT THAT. I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY PAYS A HEAVY WEIGHT USE TAX- FOR OUR- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES THAT TRIBE TRAVELED DOWN A HIGHWAY IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THEY ACTUALLY TOOK THAT MONEY. TO PAY OFF BONDS THAT ENDED UP HELPING FUND THE GENERAL FUND- TRANSPORTATION GENERAL FUND- WHICH IN. MY MIND IS NOT TO WHAT THE LAW ACTUALLY. I WAS PASSED TO DO SAME WAY WITH THE GAS TAX- WE'RE WE HAVE RECRUITED DECREASING REVENUES BECAUSE OF- THIS SITUATION WE'RE IN AND WE'RE GONNA NEED EVERY PENNY- TO GO TO THE ROADS- AND THEY HAVE A STRUCTURED NEEDS THAT OF CALIFORNIA IS LAGGING WAY BEHIND IN- SO I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE TIME WE SHOULD PUT THAT MONEY AND IT ALSO WOULD STIMULATE THE ECONOMY BY PUTTING THAT MONEY BACK IN- TO CREATING JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU.

A LOT OF ODORS IN THE COMMUNITY I'M JUST MY QUESTION TO THE COMMISSION IS WHY IF WE'RE TAKING OUT A CONTRACT TO REALLY STUDY- CLOSURE FEASIBILITY AND HOW THAT WOULD WORK WHY SO RIGID IN THE PLANNING HORIZONS WHITE WHY ARE WE ONLY LOOKING AT TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE A LOT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN THOSE SUBSEQUENT DECADES- AND THE PC ITSELF IS MODELED A MAJOR CHANGES IN THE ENERGY MIX ESPECIALLY IN THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASIN SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY FLEXIBILITY IN THE CURRENT CONTRACT TO BE STUDYING ALTERNATIVES A STAIR STEPS SCENARIOS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR HI RACHEL CAN YOU TAKE THAT PLEASE. A YES GOOD MORNING SENATOR- SO THE ORIGINAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL USE THOSE TWO YEARS 202-728-4054 A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE IS GROUNDED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LETTER FROM DENTURE BY SIMILAR TO THEN PRESIDENT TICKER ABOUT LOOKING AT A TEN YEAR CLOSURE PLAN.

THANK YOU FOR THAT- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT TWENTY THIRTY IS A CRITICAL TIE LINE FOR INSTANCE IN OUR SP THIRTY TWO GOALS AND THERE MAY BE OTHER SIGNIFICANT MILESTONES THAT WE CAN MODEL BASED UPON BUT I APPRECIATE THE CPC'S FEEDBACK INTELLIGENCE ON THIS MATTER. AND GET TO STUDY GOING OKAY. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY SIX THIS IS CAL SPEED. SPEED TESTING MORE SPEED RACING TODAY LET'S HEAR ABOUT PAT T. MOBILE AND ALL. OUR PARTNERS GO AHEAD FINANCE. INSTEAD THEY WERE VERSION INCLUDES TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND REPOSITION THE COMMISSION IT'S A BROADBAND MAPPING CAPABILITIES BY RESTRICTING THE CALCIUM MOBILE TESTING PROGRAM. B. TESTING WILL GATED DATA DATA TO BETTER INFORM THE STATE'S PRIMARY MAP AND PARCEL NORMAL MERGER AGREEMENTS HELP IDENTIFY AREAS WITHIN THE STATE ONE FIFTH OF THE TOTAL REQUEST IS ELIGIBLE TO BE REIMBURSED BY T. MOBILE IS A CONDITION THAT NEARLY FREE. OF THEIR NEWLY APPROVED MERGER WITH SPRINT HOUSE MEANWHILE IN OTHER THINGS IMPROVE SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS AFTER DISASTERS KANSAS STATE AND- FEDERAL BROADBAND FUNDING AND BETTER INFORM THE STATE. BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. SHE THE COMMISSION THEY- I'M NOT SURE WE'RE JUST TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GOT YOU THIS IS A- NICE WORK ON THE- TERMS OF THE MERGER- BELIAU I. DON'T SEE YOUR HAND UP HERE OKAY. NO CONCERNS MISTER CHAIR VERY GOOD THIS IS A STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS HOLD OPEN- MEMBERS WHO HAVE ANY QUESTION ON KILLS BE TESTING. SENATOR DOLL YOU RECOGNIZE THE MOISTURE- JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON I KNOW THAT CHICO STATE DID. A BROAD BAND. THE BASICALLY CHECK PAROLE BROADBAND IN MY DISTRICT- SOMETIME BACK AND I WAS WONDERING- WHAT CAME WITH THAT I KNOW THAT DURING THIS COVERT SITUATION THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND- CHILDREN IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE ABLE TO- THAT DO THEIR WORK- BECAUSE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO I WAS WONDERING- WHAT HAPPEN TO THE PAST INFORMATION THAT WE ARE GATHERED THROUGH THESE- MAPPING SCENARIOS AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO- IMPLEMENT. RULE BROADBAND COMMISSION CAN YOU TAKE THAT QUESTION. YES THANK YOU SENATOR I'M GONNA PASS THIS OVER TO ROB OSBORNE MY DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS ROB. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR QUESTION YES- CSU CHICO CONDUCTED A STUDY ON- AGRICULTURAL BROADBAND USING MOBILE AND- WE CAN WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU THE REPORT ON THAT BASICALLY ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TESTING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR WE HAD UP UNTIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR MOBILE- WHICH FOCUSED ON URBAN RURAL AND TRIBAL BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY AGRICULTURAL LANDS SO THAT STUDY WAS LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AGRICULTURAL LANDS. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GAP MAY BE IN ORDER TO INTRODUCE PRECISION AGRICULTURE. AND SO WHAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL BE. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REINSTITUTE OUR STATEWIDE TESTING AND THE REASON WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO TESTING MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AS ARE THE HANDSETS SO EACH TIME A NEW HANDSET COMES OUT EACH TIME THE TECHNOLOGIES UPDATED. WE HAVE TO RETEST UNDERSTAND HOW COVERAGE HAS CHANGED HOW MOBILE PERFORMANCE HAS CHANGED WHAT YOU CAN DO- ZOOM CALLS AT HOME FOR SCHOOL- WHETHER AGRICULTURAL LANDS ARE COVERED FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND FIRST A BASELINE OF WHAT THE COVERAGES BEFORE THERE'S ANY DISASTER. AND THEN WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER WHAT THE- URGENCY- BASICALLY COVERAGE- SYSTEMS THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO PLACE TO PROVIDE THAT EXTRA COVERAGE WHEN CELL SITES GO DOWN I UNDERSTAND THAT PERFORMANCE LET'S FINALLY. AT THE END WHEN- THERE'S RESTORATION BEING PUT IN PLACE BASED ON THE CELL SITES ARE BEING BROUGHT BACK UP ONLINE. RABAL TO MONITOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M I'M KNOW THAT WE'VE JUST DONE A LOT OF WORK IN WE'VE INCREASED TO. THE NINE ONE ONE FEE SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO- COMMUNICATE UNDER REAL IN REAL TIME FOR WILDFIRE. AND NOW WE'VE WE'VE SEEN. NOT ONLY LIKE YOU MENTIONED ZOOM AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THROUGH- WORK AT HOME OR- THE STATE HOME ORDERS- SO I GUESS IT IS THIS GONNA BE HOLISTICALLY LOOKED OUT WITH. HELLO YES AND ALL THOSE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES OR IS IT JUST GOING TO BE SITE SPECIFIC TO LIKE WHAT WE DID WITH CHICO STATE WITH AGRICULTURE. LIKE YOU SAID CENTER THIS IS DONE IN COORDINATION WITH CAL WE ABSOLUTELY PROVIDE DATA FOR THEM FOR THE BASELINE COVERAGE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THE CARRIERS. THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE HOLES ARE. AND THEN IN THE CASE OF A DISASTER WERE ABLE TO GO IN AND DO TESTING. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOURS ARE STILL UP AND RUNNING AND THEN FINALLY IN THE RESTORATION. ONCE SITES ARE COMING BACK. SHARE WITH YOU. S. PREVIOUS FIRE SITUATIONS ONE LAST QUESTION THAT'S AWESOME THANK YOU- WHAT WHAT DOES THAT DO EXISTING DO WE KNOW IF WE HAVE EXISTING HOLES- NOT JUST FOR DURING AN EVENT BUT HOLES WHERE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE BILL THE BILL TO COMMUNICATE AND WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS TO. ALLEVIATE THOSE HOLES. YES SO WE DO KNOW THEIR HOLES UNFORTUNATELY WE STOPPED THE MOBILE TESTING BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH IS WHY WE'RE COMING BACK TO TRY AND RESTART THIS PROGRAM. SO WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE HOLES AND- THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT INFORMATION TO TRY AND STEER FEDERAL DOLLARS INTO THOSE AREAS TO TRY AND SUBSIDIZED NEW BROADBAND DEPLOYMENTS. THANK YOU I CAN SHOW YOU- WITHIN A HUNDRED MILE RADIUS OF MY HOME AND ALL THE DEAD SPOTS. YEAH ONE OF THE ONE OF THE STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT IS WITH THIS TESTING IT'S A COMBINATION OF THESE THREE NEW POSITIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AT THE COMMISSION AND THEN THERE'S SOME. CONTRACTS THAT THEY GOT IT AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS AND WE'RE WONDERING WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING WITH THE COMMISSION WHAT'S THE MIX WHAT IS THAT WHY IS IT NOT ALL BROUGHT IN HOUSE TO DO THAT. TO FIGURE OUT THE HOLES WITH- YES AND- THE COMMISSION SO THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON. I THINK ONE OF THE- THINGS IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING AS A LEGISLATOR IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO. WE HAVE- YES WE HAVE CAL FIRE WE HAVE. WE HAVE THE PROVIDERS THERE WE HAVE AND WE'VE WE'VE INCREASED RESOURCES THROUGH BILLS LIKE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHICH BRINGS- THE CAST FOR THE FUNDS TO- THE LAST MILE UNSERVED COMMUNITIES- BUT SOMEHOW THERE NEEDS TO BE. A ONE AGENCY THAT THAT SAYS OKAY IF WE'RE GOING TO FILL THIS HOLE MAY WE CAN TAKE SOME FUNDS FROM. THE NINE ONE ONE WE CAN TAKE SOME FUNDS FROM SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE AND WE CAN FILL THE SPOTS BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE GET SILO DOUBT. AND THERE'S NO ABILITY TO CROSS OVER AND ACTUALLY FIX THE DEAD ZONES THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE SO WE CAN COMMUNICATE WHEN WE WHEN WE NEED REAL TIME- IN EMERGENCY SO I WOULD BE. OPEN TO IDEAS FROM FROM YOU GUYS THERE OR EVEN LEGISLATORS ON HOW WE CAN GET- THOSE- DEAD'S DEAD ZONES AND THOSE UNSERVED POPULATIONS OUT THERE SERVED THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. ART SCENE NO OTHER CONCERNS WITH MEMBERS AND SEEING THAT WERE CLIPPING RIGHT ALONG WE WILL NOT PAUSE- N. THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR PARTY THE AGENDA.

PULLED ITEM NUMBER SIX FROM THE CONSENT MORE HERE AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR WE HAVE SEVEN ISSUES IN PART BE FOR DISCUSSION LET'S START OFF WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW- BUT THE RESOURCES FROM THE- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WELCOME. BELIAU GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS IF I COULD I WILL- SHARE A SCREEN I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF POWER POINT SLIDES. I THINK I NEED TO BE VERY GOOD ENABLED- IS THAT GETTING WORKED OUT I WILL I JUST NEED YOU TO AGAIN MY NAME'S BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WERE ASKED TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF. EVEN TATIAN ON- THE ADMINISTRATIONTHEY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION- AND SO WE HAVE A FEW SLIDES HERE. SO GIVE ME JUST A MOMENT AGO. THIS. WE HELLO GUYS THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M USED TO SEEING IN JUNE. SO LET ME. MR BROWN'S BEAUTIFUL WORLD WORLD ALONG WITH THAT. I DON'T KNOW ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE MY- THE DAY SLIDE TITLED OVERVIEW OF GOVERNORS MAY REVISION I JUST SEE YOU. JUST ME I APOLOGIZE. I MIGHT NEED SOME HELP FROM LDC HERE. THE SHARE SCREEN APPLICATION THE WINDOW I GET A DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'M USED TO SEEING. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK I CAN I CAN WALK THROUGH VERBALLY. ONE TICKET TO MUCH TIME ID. LET'S GIVE LDC A CUP OF WHILE TO FIGURE IT OUT. THIS. FOR MEMBERS CAESAR THESE ARE ITEMS- STARTING AT PAGE. BOTH A AND PART B. HI ISSUE NUMBER ONE THROUGH ISSUE NUMBER THREE ON YOUR HAND OUT A HUNDRED PAGE UNDER. RIGHT. WHAT IS IT IS IT WORKING NOW SENATOR WE HAVE IT IN A RATHER LARGE FONT. A LARGE FILE OKAY. I KNOW YOU HAVE BIG IDEAS MR BROWN BUT WE WANT TO DOWNSIZE THEM A LITTLE BIT FOR THAT OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY THERE YOU GO. HAVE YOUR SLIDES COMMENCE OKAY ALL RIGHT I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY- SO AGAIN SO THE WELL JUST RUN THROUGH RELATIVELY QUICKLY HERE AT A HIGH LEVEL THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OVERVIEW. OF THE COMPARISON OF THE MAY REVISION IS A JANUARY BUDGET I'LL JUST NOTE TO THEIR A COUPLE SLIDES HERE THAT DO INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION. ABOUT TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY JUST FOR THE REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO FOCUS ON RESOURCES. AND ENVIRONMENT. SO THIS IS THE FIRST SLIDE HERE- THE FIRST LIGHT HERE SHOWS OVERALL SPENDING IN THE MAY REVISION RELATIVE TO JANUARY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT OVERALL SPENDING AND THIS INCLUDES GENERAL FUNDS SPECIAL FUNDS AND BONDS FINDS. IS ACTUALLY RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE TWO THE TWO PROPOSED BUDGET- UNDERLINED THAT THOUGH IMPORTANTLY- AND ALL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THIS IN THE NEXT SLIDE. R. A NUMBER OF REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THE OFFSET IN SOME CASES BY INCREASING SPENDING AND OTHERS MOST NOTABLY IN SPECIAL FUNDS. AND BONDS FUNDS. SO ON THIS SLIDE IN THE NEXT SLIDE. IS A TABLE WHICH SHOWS GENERAL FIND SOLUTIONS IN THE MAY REVISION RELATIVE TO JANUARY- FULL BRIDGE THE CIVICALLY RELATED TO EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS- I WILL CERTAINLY GO THROUGH EACH OF THE SEVERAL EITHER ON YOUR AGENDA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS MORNING STILL. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT YOU'LL SEE REALLY IS THAT FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE NOT REDUCTIONS. TO BASELINE SPENDING AND RESOURCES PROGRAMS INSTEAD MOST OF THESE REDUCTIONS RELATIVE TO JANUARY OUR WITHDRAWALS OF JANUARY PROPOSALS. THEY ARE FINE SHIPS SO REDUCING GENERAL FUND SPENDING FOR PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT BACKED ONLY NOT IN WHOLE OR IN PART THE SPECIAL FUNDS. OR THEY'RE PAUSING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS EITHER ONE PROPOSED IN JANUARY ONES AUTHORIZED IN PRIOR BUDGETS BUT IN SO DOING KEEPING EXISTING FACILITIES- FUNDED IN AN OPERATING. YEAH THERE ARE A COUPLE OF IMPORT EXCEPTION TO THAT YOU SHOULD EITHER ON YOUR- AGENDA TODAY THE FIRST IS WITH RESPECT TO DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- THIS IS A PROPOSAL ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE SLIDE. A TRIGGER REDUCTION OF THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION THIS WOULD BE A REDUCTION OF BASELINE FUNDING AGAIN I WILL SPEND MORE TIME. ON THAT BECAUSE THAT IS ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY. THIS IS JUST A SEC SLIDE THE CONTINUATION OF THAT TABLE ANOTHER- BASELINE REDUCTION AGAIN ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY. IT BUT NOT ON THIS TABLE IS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND REDUCTION. FOR STATE PARKS- THE REASON IT'S NOT ON THE TABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSED TO BE IMPLEMENTED NOT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. YOU CAN SEE THERE- AND THIS IS JUST THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURE REDUCTION GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS IN THE MAY REVISION THE NUMBER OF EVEN SMALLER ONES. IN ADDITION REALLY THE AREA THAT PROVIDED THE MOST GENERAL FUND BENEFIT THOSE LARGE GENERAL FUND SOLUTION. IN THE MAY REVISION FROM THESE PROGRAM AREAS ARE ACTUALLY SPECIAL FUND LOANS AND TRANSFERRED. TO THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE AND TRANSPORTATION ALREADY- BUT YOU CAN SEE THE LIST HERE IS QUITE A FEW. DIFFERENT LOANS AND TRANSFERS TOTALING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S A VERY LARGE BENEFIT TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT IS AN IMPORTANT NOTICE TO JUST ONE TIME BENEFIT SO ONE SEES- LOVE THESE FUNDS ARE LOANED OR TRANSFERRED- THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE. FOR DOING SO IN THE FUTURE. AND IMPORTANTLY TO THE ONES THAT ARE LOANS AND POINT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A FUTURE GENERAL FUND OBLIGATIONS THAT'S CREATED BY THAT TO REPAY THOSE. FUTURE THE- MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION SO WELL MOST OF THE FOCUS IS ON. REDUCING COSTS- TRANSFERRING FUNDING IN ORDER TO. MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT TO THE GENERAL FUND GIVEN THE GENERAL CONDITION THERE ARE A FEW PLACES WHERE THAT THERE WHERE THERE ARE CHANNELS AND AUGMENTATION. AGAIN A COUPLE OF THESE ARE ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY BUT I JUST HIGHLIGHT THE FIRST TWO IN PARTICULAR UNDER PARKS AND CDFA. THIS IS FUNNY THAT WE VIEW IS GENERALLY NECESSARY IS TO BACK FILL FOR THE STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS AS WELL STATE PARKS TOO THEY CAN- OPERATE CONTINUE TO OPERATE. OR PAY FOR UNNECESSARY COSTS. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A REDUCTION IN REVENUES FROM THEIR SHIPPING FEES OR FROM OTHER BANDS SO THESE ARE A NECESSARY COST DRIVEN REALLY BY B. COVE IN NINETEEN. CRISIS AND PEOPLE STAYING AT HOME. IN ADDITION YOU CAN SEE A FEW OTHER- GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION PROPOSE IN THE MAY REVISION. IT'S NOT VERY MANY BUT- THERE ARE A FEW NOTABLE ONES THAT ARE ON THE AGENDA TODAY. A COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL- COMMENTS ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET AND OVERALL ARCHITECTURE. IN GENERAL I FIND THAT THE PROPOSALS INCLUDING THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION THAT'S- THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE OF THE LOANS TRANSFERRED AND ALSO THE SHIPS. THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE SPECIAL FUNDS ARE BEING USED TO BACKFILL GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS. WINDOWS ARE JUST ONE TIME AND WE DO PROJECT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET PROBLEM. BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE LAST TWO COMMENTS HERE JUST- THE ARE REALLY IN SOME WAYS THE SIDES OF THE SAME COIN- BROADLY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE- CUTS IMPROVE- PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION FOR THE AUGMENTATIONS- THESE. ULTIMATELY ARE ONES THAT REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES AND SO WE'D RECOMMEND THAT AS YOU LOOK AT EACH OF THESE. THAT YOU CONSIDER THEM- WHETHER THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR GENERAL FUND PRIORITY AND NOT JUST WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. BUT IN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BROADER STATEWIDE BUDGET WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- CHANNEL FIND PRODUCTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE. IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. BY JUNE FIFTEENTH. IT'S ALSO WORTH MENTIONING THERE ARE A FEW SIGNIFICANT SPECIAL AND BOND FUND RELATED PROPOSALS AND THEN A REVISION AS YOU KNOW A SPECIAL FUNDS AND BONDS AND ACTUALLY MAKE A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL SPENDING IN THE RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS SUCH A HIGHLY VERY QUICKLY JUST A FEW OF THOSE YOU KNOW MOST OF THE DISCUSSION OF LATE IS FOCUSED ON THE- CHANNELS ON THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT PROPOSALS HERE THE FIRST IS CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES TO PROPOSE THE SAME SPENDING PLAN AS IN JANUARY INCLUDING A NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY. SPENDING PLAN IMPORTANTLY THAN A REVISION DOES HAVE MODIFIED BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT PRIORITIZES THE REVENUES TOWARDS CERTAIN PROGRAMS. AND IN OUR VIEW THIS IS HAVING SOME SORT OF PRIORITIZATION IS REALLY CRITICAL THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY GIVEN REDUCED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT REVENUES WILL BE LOWER. IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN. ASSUMED SO ESTABLISHING SOME SOME SORT OF MECHANISM TO PRIORITIZE REVENUES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS IS VERY REASONABLE. WE SIMPLY POINT OUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU COULD STRUCTURE THIS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY HAVE. TWO TIERS THE FIRST SET OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING. AS REVENUE COMES IN AND ONCE THOSE ARE FULLY FUNDED BEEN THE REMAINING PROGRAMS COULD START RECEIVING FUN YOU COULD HAVE MORE CARE YOU COULD STRUCTURE IT DIFFERENT WAYS. AND OF COURSE MOST IMPORTANTLY THE FINAL SPENDING PLAN SHOULD REFLECT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT. I WORTH NOTING THE MAYOR WITHDRAWS TWO MAJOR CLIMATE PROPOSALS FROM JANUARY OF FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR CLIMBED UP ON. AND ALSO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEWLY ESTABLISHED CLIMATE CATALYSTS LINED. AND TWO OTHER QUICK NOTES- THE MAY REVISION AND STILL CONTINUES WHAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY PROPOSAL THAT WOULD RELATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. THIS IS TO CREATE A NEW OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT WOULD- IN ADDITION TO DOING OVERSIGHT WITNESSED WHICH SET FEES IN THE FUTURE AND ALSO TRAILER THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW FEE STRUCTURE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THEN NOTABLY THERE'S ALSO INCREASE SPENDING IN THE MAY REVISION. FROM BOND FUND PRICKLY PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TWO YEARS AGO- THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS EXPLAIN AND- WHY EVEN THOUGH YOU SEE ALL THOSE GENERAL FUND REDUCTIONS. IN THE BUDGET- THIS INCREASE IN MONTANA IS THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS THAT OVERALL SPENDING APPEARS TO BE FLAT. SO WITH THAT- I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OF COURSE MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE TO HELP ADDRESS. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- AS WE GO FOR THREE GENDER. WHEN WE HEAR FROM FINANCE ON THEIR COMMENTS AND THEN WILL PASS WILL OPEN UP FOR MEMBERS. DO YOU LIKE TO RESPOND ANYTHING THE HERS. FINANCE IN THE MORNING TO RESET HELLERTOWN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM. ARE ALWAYS AVAILABLE. FOLLOW OKAY- WHAT'S THAT TURNED TO MEMBERS SAID MEMBERS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OR MAKE A COMMENT IF YOU CAN KEEP THEM UNDER TWO MINUTES WE ARE IN A LITTLE TIME BASIS. HERE I'LL JUST NOTED THAT. GENERALLY ALL THE CAP AND TRADE ITEMS AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AGENDA HAVE BEEN- BUT PUSHED OUT SO WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THIS I KNOW ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS USES. REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THERE ARE OTHER VERY VALUABLE PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE- THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PUTS OUT A PROPOSAL WE HAVE. WORK THAT WE DO HERE DETERMINING WHICH- PROGRAMS GIVE US THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK BECAUSE WE STILL DO HAVE A CLIMATE CRISIS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE USE WHATEVER LIMITED SO FANS WE HAVE- SO. IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. OTHERWISE IN THAT CENTER DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- TIES HAVE A GENERAL COMMENT FIRST I DIDN'T. WELL THIS WHOLE I'M GONNA TAKE TAKE OPPORTUNITY FIRST TO THANK MY STAFF THAT HAS VIGOROUSLY WORK SINCE THURSDAY NIGHT ON GETTING FOUR HUNDRED BILLS OR FOUR HUNDRED- PROPOSALS. ARE REVIEWED AND I AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT BEING DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA I FEEL REALLY DISENFRANCHISED RIGHT NOW ON THE BILL TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WERE ASKED TO DO IN THE SHORT PERIOD TODAY. NUMBER ONE AND SO- THERE ARE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO GO FORWARD AND HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO EVEN HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT AT ALL SO BUT I KNOW THAT WILL BE FOR ANOTHER TIME I NO WONDER TIME FRAME SO. I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF- WE WERE UP. WE GOT A LOT OF THE STUFF LATE LAST NIGHT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND WE WERE HERE AT SEVEN THIS MORNING TRYING TO DIGEST ALL THIS BUT I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE- FOR THE LA O'S OFFICE SO WE BASICALLY HAVE THE BUZZ THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE BACK ON. WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE PROCESS IS TODAY WHICH IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE A MASS VOTE HERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HEAR THESE PROPOSALS THROUGH A REGULAR- COMMITTEE PROCESS. SO I HAVE ONE QUESTION ON THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE- WE CREATED THE DTS C. TO DO JUST THAT IS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT SO THAT WE DIDN'T. AND WAS A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT CREATED THEM- TO ALLOW THEM TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE EXPERTS ARE THERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE EXPERTS FIND OUT WHAT. WE USE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S IN A BARREL OF OIL- THAT'S GOING TO. CONTAMINATE OR NOT CONTAMINATE OR HURT THE PUBLIC AND NOW WE'RE GOING BACK AND WE'RE ASKING TO RECREATE A BOARD TO. OVERSEE THAT BOARD AND THEN GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SET. UP FINES AND FEES WHICH GOES BACK TO THEM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE- THE FOX- GARDEN IN HOUSE SO I WHAT WAS WANTED WHAT THE THOUGHT PROCESS IS- IN THIS- PROPOSAL. YEAH I'D LIKE THE LA- ANSWERED THAT IT WAS PART OF THAT REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE HAD THAT WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY HAVE- AN APPEALS. BOARD BUT PLEASE ELLIE A GO AHEAD. YES THANK YOU- THIS IS BRIAN BROWN AGAIN WITH THE LA- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO IS REALLY OUR LEAD ON PTSD I THINK IS STILL HAVING TROUBLE GETTING IN- SEAN MARTIN BUT- I CAN TAKE A FIRST STEP IN THE INSURANCE. AND WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK. TO YOU SENATOR DOLLY IT AS NECESSARY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS PROPOSAL INITIALLY BACK IN JANUARY- WE FELT LIKE IT WAS ULTIMATELY A REASONABLE APPROACH- GIVEN. PAST REVIEWS BY. THE REVIEW PANEL THAT BEEN CONVENTION. THE MAIN ISSUE NOW I THINK THAT WE FACE IS THAT THIS ULTIMATELY IS A- VERY SIGNIFICANT. POLICY CHANGES PROPOSED AND AS YOU MENTIONED. THE COMMITTEE HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO. FULLY FLESH IT OUT IN SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING OVER THE PAST. COUPLE OF MONTHS WE DO THINK THE PROPOSAL REASONABLE AT THE PROPOSAL TO. LOOK REAL LOOK AT THE FEE STRUCTURE IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE ON GOING A VERY SIZEABLE. STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND IN THOSE FUNDS AND AS OF JANUARY THE PROPOSAL HAD BEE USED TO BEEN TO USE GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL. THOSE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS THE PROPOSAL NOW AMAZED TO USE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND BUT THAT AGAIN IS A ONE TIME SOLUTION SO THINKING ON A LONGER TERM ABOUT HOW TO. DO PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT TO GIVE IN PAST PROBLEMS AND ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND WE- DEALT TO OTHER MAJOR FUN DATE THAT WE THINK ARE REASONABLE PROPOSALS. YOU COULD CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT- GIVEN THEM PRIMARILY POLICY PROPOSALS YOU COULD CONSIDER WHETHER TO. WHETHER YOU WANT AN ACTING PART OF THIS BUDGET OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO THEM- OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS GIVEN THAT. THE ENACTMENT OF THE TRAILER BILLS NOT NECESSARY TO ENACT THE CURRENT. BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THE ROLE OF THE OVERSIGHT BOARD. SO I A. N. AND I MAY WANT TO ASK IF FINANCE WANTS TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GIVEN THAT IT'S THEIR PROPOSAL BUT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THE- AND AS WE REVIEW THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THE PURPOSE OF THE BOARD WHICH WOULD BE TWO FOLD ONE IT WOULD HEAR APPEALS TO IT WOULD BE TO- TO SET FEET ON AN ONGOING BASIS THAT THE INTENTION WOULD BE TO SET THOSE FEES IN A WAY THAT ALIGN WITH. THE APPROVED BUDGET- ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE EACH YEAR. SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN THE THIRD IN TERMS OF THE PARTICULAR FOR THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY THERE SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE MONITORING AND PUBLIC REPORTING- THE DEPARTMENT OF THE SCHOOLS AND ITS ACT THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKING. TO IMPLEMENT- STATED GOALS. OKAY THANK YOU RAISE THAT- THIRTY SEE ANOTHER HAND. SENATOR STERN RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS AS THESE ISSUES COME UP FOR DISCUSSION BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE HIGH LEVEL COMMENT WHICH IS A GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT. THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL BUDGET. LOOKING SOMEWHAT EXPENDABLE AT THIS POINT BASED ON THE PROPOSALS WE'VE SEEN WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER AREAS A CRISIS RIGHT NOW IN THE GENERAL FUND. AS WELL AS OUR SPECIAL FUNDS- BUT WHEN I LOOK AT. TREATING SAY THE FISH AND WILDLIFE'S BUDGET. CUTS TO BACK FILL THE GENERAL FUND IS A SOLUTION- THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A SOLUTION TO ME- OUR CLEAN AIR MONEY YOU BEING USED TO BACKFILL- SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT MONEY THAT IS GOING TO BE CRUCIAL TO GET THROUGH THIS MEGA DROUGHT THIS YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. CUT YOU LOOK AT DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC- STRUGGLING AND HAVE TO. LOOK AT THEIR ENTIRE MISSION A NEW ENDS IN PROP SIXTY EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION EVEN THOUGH I CAN SEE. I APPRECIATE THE EXPEDITED EXPENDITURE PUSH WE'RE STILL SEEING MAJOR PULLBACKS IN COMMUNITY ACCESS AND OTHER CRITICAL FUNDING. SO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AREA OF THE BUDGET WHICH IS BUILT IN ALREADY A SMALL SECTION OF THE GENERAL FUND. BEING UTILIZED REALLY FOR BACKFILL SUPPORT AND NOT. LOOKING FORWARD. THESE COSTS WILL COME BACK TO BITE US WHETHER IT'S GOING TO SHORTEN PULLING UP SHORT ON FIRES THE DROUGHT. ATTENDING EXTINCTIONS OR THE CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE- THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT'S IT IT'S A GENERAL HIGH LEVEL COMMENT BUT I HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME WAY TO LOOK FOR AND I DID WANT TO ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I DIDN'T I CAUGHT THE LA FRAMING THE- THE WILDFIRE BANDA THE CLIMATE BOND AS A WITHDRAWAL BUT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD FROM MR VISWANATHA ON IT THE GENERAL BUDGET HEARING LAST WEEK WAS THAT. THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WAS STILL CONSIDERING- BONDING AS A POSSIBILITY FOR FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING WHETHER IT'S BUILT OR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN WE GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT IS THERE STILL OPEN THIS- THE SENATE. SENT IN A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR THIS WEEK- THE SIMPLY DID THE SAME ON VARIOUS BOND PROPOSALS BUT IS THERE STILL OPENNESS TO USING GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDING IS ONE OF. MANY MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE PENDING LIABILITIES HERE MISS CALVERT YOU WANNA TAKE THAT. THIS IS THERESA CALLING AND- THE PERIMETER YEAH- CORRECT WE HAVE JOHN THAT NIGHT IT WAS WORKING FINE BUT- DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE ON APPROACHES THAT ARE SPECIALLY FOCUSED ON JOB CREATION WHICH WAS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. PROVISIONS PAGES SO I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC MECHANISM. BUT I KNOW THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THAT FOCUS ON STOCK. I BELIEVE IT SEAN MARTIN WITH THE LA- IT'S ON THE PHONE TRYING TO SPEAK ON THIS CAN WE- PATCH MEN. MODERATOR. THIS TIME I'M AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WAS HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND I WAS JUST ABLE TO JOIN THAT THE HEARING IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT CAL JAM NOW I- I'M DEPARTMENT TALK TO SUBSTANCES CONTROL THE HAPPY DANCE IN. WE'LL WE'LL TAKE THOSE. FOLLOW UP BEFORE THURSDAY'S FULL BUDGET HEARING- FOR MEMBERS I KNOW- WE'VE ASKED FOR A BREAKDOWN WE'VE BEEN JAM FOR TIME ON THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING BECAUSE IF THERE'S A BIG JUMP FROM. JANUARY YOU KNOW THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE FORTY BILLION DOLLAR BOND IT WAS A BILLION DOLLAR PIECE. NOW IT'S IT WAS A HALF A BILLION NOW IT'S UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION SO. THE BREAK DOWN OF HOW THAT IS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ITEM SHIPPED TO THIS CLIMATE CATALYST FROM THE TO THE CLIMATE BONDS. OFF THE CAP AND TRADE INTO TWENTY SEVEN TO A PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND JUST SORT OF SORTING OUT THAT. VERY GOOD OKAY. I SEE NO OTHER HANDS LET'S- THANK YOU L. A. O. THANK YOU FINANCE FOR THAT LET'S MOVE TO OUR FIRST DISCUSSION ITEM THIS WILL BE CAL FIRE- THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THREE TWENTY NINE ON YOUR. SHE'S MEMBERS GO AHEAD CAL FIRE IF YOU'RE ONLINE. YEAH FIRST DOING BAD SO IT'S KIND OF A QUICK OVERVIEW- IF I COULD- FINANCE SO THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES EIGHTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. FIVE POINT ONE MILLION I'M GOING. FIGHTING POSITIONS BY CALIFORNIA. BILITY THE FIRE SEASON AND BEYOND AS FAR. THAT'S THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED IN HIS- MIRACLE EAR VERSION RELEASE I WOULD SAY HE IS ONE OF THE AREAS WITHIN. YOU NEED TO WANNA MAKE OR INVESTMENTS- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PREPARED FOR- IF THAT IS THAT I CAN CERTAINLY HELP. SO THEY REGION MODIFIES A GOVERNMENT OF WOLVES- BY ELIMINATING THE NON FIREFIGHTER POSITIONS THAT WERE BOTH PROS AT THAT TIME AS WELL AS- VARIOUS ONE TIME INVESTMENTS- INSTEAD IT DEDICATES ALL OF THE FUNDING. THE SAME LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GETS ALL THE FUNDING TO FIRE FIRE FIRE FIGHTER SPECIFIC RELATED POSITIONS- AND THEN OUT OF PORTIONS OF THE FINDINGS WILL BE USED- ACROSS THE FIVE YEAR PHASE IN LAND FOR. SEASONAL FIREFIGHTING POSITIONS AND SOME SEARCH ASKING RESOURCES AS THEY WORK THROUGH THEIR **** DEFINITELY ONE OF THE PERMANENT POSITIONS BUT WHEN. THEY HAPPEN REACH OUT THAT WAY I JUST KNOW THIS WELL THE COMMITTEETHAT OVER THE PAST YEARS STACEY'S TO COMMENT. OF VERY SIMMERED EASTON AS WELL AS SOMEBODY ACT. ONE TIME APPROACH. TO HELP ADDRESS THE NUMBER OF. JOBS PAST YOU RELATED. NEEDS SUCH AS FOURTH FIREFIGHTER AND EXTENDING. THE FIRE. ENGINE AVAILABILITY. RIGHT IN THE BACK INTO THE FIRE SEASON IS ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE THAT RELY ON. MY INSTAGRAM- THAT ONE TIME NATURE AND. PUT IN CEMENT BASE FUNDING TO GET. ACCESSIBILITY TO TRY THOSE. ON AN ONGOING INITIALLY KNOW THAT YOUR FUNDAMENTAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS PROVIDE BOTH FLEXIBLE AND PERSONAL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT BOTH OUR PROTECTION. AND FOREST MANAGEMENT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S REALLY IN BOTH AREAS- ONE OF THE KEY IMPORTANT PIECES OF. PERMANENT STAFFING. IS THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE NON B. SEASON TWO DUE FOREST. KILLS. REDUCTION PROJECTS WERE THERE BE. CAN HOLD THEM UNION AND CLEARING OR PRESCRIBED THE OTHER TOOLS AVAILABLE. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY HARD FLEXIBILITY IN THE PERSON TOLD ME THIS PACKAGE PROVIDES. AND THEN LASTLY JUST. IT WAS RIGHT AT JUST ABOUT TERM FUNDING WE WILL THAT THAT AT THIS POINT WOULD COMPROMISE SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS HE'S- AND IT'S YOU. KNOW LIES ON STARTING AT LIKE WE HIRE TEMPORARY OR SEASONAL WORKERS- THAT HELPS ME KEEP FIREMEN ALEXIS JUST TALKING ABOUT HAVING THAT WORK FORCE IN THE OFF. SEASON TO HELP YOURSELF LAST THE BOARD THEY NEEDS TO BE DONE WORKFORCE. ALSO I THINK ONE OF THE- REASONS FOLKS TALK ABOUT SEASONAL IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF IT MAYBE IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE THAN- HAVING A PERMANENT I THINK WITH A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COME WITH HIRING AND- AND DOWN SIZING THE SEASONAL STAFF AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S REALLY NOT. A GREAT DEAL OF ACTUAL SAVINGS THAT COMES WITH THAT A ROUTE OVER AND- THANKS. I'M ALSO THE SEASONAL YOU GET A LOT OF BODIES THAT HAVE LOWER SKILL LEVEL AND- FOR INSTANCE SO THAT THE LATTER SKILLS AND TRAINING THAT YOU GET FROM THE COMPANY OFFICER. PERMANENT STAFFING REDUCES- THE FLEXIBILITYAND INDEPENDENCE. VILLAGE WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND PERSONNEL AND WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THE- I WAS. YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND THEY CAN GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE NEED AND YOU LOSE A BUNCH OF THAT VERSATILITY AND FLEXIBILITY. YOU HAVE AN OVER RELIANCE ON THE SEASONAL. SO JUST WANTED TO. YOU KNOW ALSO I GUESS LAST WEEK POINT OUT THAT I WILL BE IN THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THE PERMANENT. PHYSICIANS IN PLACES THAT IT HAS THEM IN THE UNITS ON AN ONGOING BASIS CONTINUOUSLY SO THAT HELPS. SHIPS WITH BOTH THE LOCAL LANDOWNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND HAVING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS IS A REAL BENEFIT ALSO TO- FORCE MANAGEMENT PEOPLE BREAK. OUT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN THE JUST OPERATION IS NEEDED AT. THE STATE LEVEL SO WITH THAT YOUR AVAILABLE FOR. QUESTIONS ALSO YOU SAW THE DEPARTMENT SO. RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE CENSUS MISS PETERS WITH THE LA YOU HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. IT AS MR KAREN AND MAN AND MEMBERS I JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SO IT JUST AND IN TERMS OF- PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR OVERALL BUDGET PRIORITIES AND AS A PERSONAL FINANCES INDICATED ALREADY THAT THE REVISION DOES RETAIN A VERY SIGNIFICANT I'M STOPPING AUGMENTATION FOR CAL FIRE AND THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS AS WAS MENTIONED TOO I'M REFOCUS SOME OF THE POSITIONS I'M JUST A LITTLE DETAIL AROUND THE SEASONAL RESOURCES WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE INCLUDES I'M FORTY FOUR MILLION OF THOSE DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR SEASONAL. AND SEARCH CAPACITIES THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF COMING FIRE SEASON THIS SUMMER AND OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA NEED TO WEIGH THIS SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION AGAINST OTHER BUDGETARY PRIORITIES AND GIVEN THAT D. D. CURRENT DRY CONDITIONS THAT WE HAD IN THE LITTLE PRECIPITATION WINTER THAT WE HAD THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE A PARTICULARLY BAD FIRE YEAR AND SO THERE CAN BE VERY GOOD REASONS FOR WANTING TO AUGMENT HEALTHCARE'S RESOURCES. I'M AS DEPARTMENT FINANCES INDICATED I'M ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS COULD JUST BE TO FOCUS ON THEIR SEASONAL RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN GET ON BOARD VERY QUICKLY AND I ALSO SORT OF LIMITS YOUR ON GOING ON GENERAL FUND COMMITMENTS AND ANOTHER OPTION COULD BE TO DO I'M JUST THE FIRST YEAR AT THIS MULTI YEAR PLAN SO THAT WOULD PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL. ARE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THIS UPCOMING FIRE SEASON AS WELL AS ON BOARDING I'M UP FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTING PERMANENT FIREFIGHTING STAFF- AND THEN YOU COULD- WAIT AND SEE WHEN YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATES FOR A FUTURE FISCAL OUTLOOK AND THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION IN THE COMING YEARS AND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE STATE ECONOMIC CONDITION- I BELIEVE THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION DOES AND. LAY OUT ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE PUT. I'M IN PARTICULAR JUST DOING THE FIRST YEAR OF FINDING AND THAT REALLY PUT YOU A LOT OF. IS STILL GO FORWARD WITH PLAN OF ALSO PRESERVE REFLEXIVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS IN THE FUTURE AS YOU GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATE. I'M HAPPIER GENERAL FINE CONDITION WHICH IS ALSO EXPECTED TO HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. AND ALSO THE BACKGROUND OR THAT WE HAD ON THE 2% OF THE FOREST AT THE STATE OWNS IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'VE SPENT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON. MITIGATION AND SUPPRESSION THIS THIS CHANGES AS EACH FIRE SEASON THIS HOW MUCH. PERMANENT STAFF IS ABLE TO DO THAT THE MITIGATION WORK THAT WE WANT TO HAVE DONE- VERSUS FIGHTING A FIRE THAT'S- A BLAZING AND- DECEMBER SO WE WON'T REALLY KNOW THAT. AHEAD OF EACH FIRE SEASON. CORRECT. THERE MUST BE CORRECT YES. I MEAN TROUBLE GETTING MYSELF AND EIGHT IN TERMS OF THAT THE- RESOURCES FOR AUGMENTING THE FIRE RESPONSE STAFF AND IT IS CORRECT THAT THOSE RESOURCES CAN BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SUN AND ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR DOING THESE PROJECTS IN THE OFFSEASON I'M HOWEVER AND I WOULD KNOW THERE ISN'T GREAT DATA ON THE AMOUNT OF THAT WORK IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE WITH THE STAFF THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS GRANT PROGRAMS IN OTHER STOCKS THAT CAL FIRE HAS DEDICATED TO DOING. CERTAIN PREVENTION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS DEDICATED DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION CREWS- AND THEN THAT FOREST HEALTH TYPES OF GRANTS THAT ARE BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT AND SO WHILE THERE COULD BE SOME CROSSOVER AND IT DOES THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN TERMS OF THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOING TO COME TO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED AND SET UP TO DO THOSE- AND AS YOU SAID THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPACITY. THESE ARE FIGHTING STUFF WOULD HAVE TO ASSIST WITH THOSE BUT I'M SURE THE MINISTER SHOULD BE WIDELY IN AS WELL MMHM OUR MEMBERS AS YOU CAN SEE THE WE'VE TAKEN THE ALLEY- SEGMENTATION OR ONE OF THE OPTIONS AND FULLY FUND THE FIRE- CAL FIRE AND THE RELIEF STAFFING FOR A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POSITIONS THIS YEAR. THE COMPLETE AMOUNT THAT- EIGHTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION AND THEN AS WE GO THROUGH THIS FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE TRY TO LOOK PRUDENTLY NEXT YEAR TO SEE WHAT'S WHAT'S BEST WHAT'S BEST WOULDN'T GIVE THEM THE FULL FUNDING SO. ANYONE HAVE QUESTIONS. FOR THE LA OVER. CAL FIRE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR I THINK IT'S MORE FOR CAL FIRE INITIALLY. WE KNOW THE FIRE RISK REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A SEASON ANYMORE WE CAN CALL IT SEASONAL STAFFING AT THIS POINT BUT WE JUST HAD A MAJOR FIRE LAST WEEK- IN THE DISTRICT AND- IT'S ALREADY BEGUN. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. BABB PRIORITIES AND HOW THESE PERSONNEL STAFFING POSITIONS WOULD BE UTILIZED TO THE CHAIRS POINT- HOW MUCH IS SORT OF ANTICIPATED TO BE IN THE CROSSOVER SPACE CITY OF. FIRE RISK MITIGATION VERSES. SORT OF AN ONGOING SUPPRESSION STAND BY RESOURCE HAS HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO THAT BREAK DOWN. BUT I CAN COVER THAT IF YOU LIKE. PLEASE GO AHEAD BAND DIRECTOR. WELL GOOD MORNING AND I SHARE WORKOUTS SKI AND SENATORS- I APPRECIATE BEING IN FRONT OF YOU. TODAY HAND REALLY I'D LIKE TO SIMPLY EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF PERMANENT STAFFING TO MEET THE INCREASING DEMANDS ARE PLACED ON CAL FIRE TO MEET THE YEAR ROUND WORK LOAD AS AS SENATOR STERN JUST MENTION OF WHAT'S NOW A UBIQUITOUS- FIRE YEAR IS KEY TO MEETING ALL OF THEIR THE MISSION ELEMENTS THAT CAL FIRE. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO- AND WHILE WE DO HAVE FIRES A YEAR ROUND NOW- THERE ARE PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THAT THOSE BUYERS ARE LESS LIKELY FOR- REQUIRE LESS OF A FULL RESPONSE MEETING STATEWIDE- RESPONSE SO WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE PERMANENT- EXTRA PERMANENT STAFFING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL IS. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO PRESCRIBED FIRE WORK FOR INSTANCE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHEN WE'RE RESPONDING TO WILDFIRES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY AND SOME IN SOME CASES- IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STAPLE THE SE- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE WILL THIS WILL GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY- AND THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO SEARCH NOT ONLY TO THE PEAK FIRE SEASON- THAT HAPPENS. ANNUALLY BUT ALSO THE FIRE YEAR- AS WELL AS TO MEET THE INCREASING NEEDS OF DOING THAT FUELS WORK TO MEET OUR CLIMATE- GOALS IN REDUCING- CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IN FORESTED AREAS BY- HELPING THOSE FOR US TO REMAIN HEALTHY AND ON- SEQUESTER CARBON. AS WELL AS THE OF FUEL THAT COULD CARRY FOR INTO NEIGHBORHOODS- AND AREAS WHERE- POPULATIONS OR INFRASTRUCTURE COULD BE DAMAGED SO- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT I CAN'T. EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE IMPORTANCE FOR US- IT WILL PUT US ON A TRACK TO. BETTER MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND WORK TOWARD THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WILL HAVE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU CHIEF. JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE FLIRTY YEAH JUST TRYING TO GET A LITTLE CLARITY SO ANY ANY ANTICIPATED BREAK DOWN THOUGH FOR THE SORT OF ABILITY TO MAKE THIS STAFF USEFUL FOR SAY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS THAN ANTICIPATED USE. GOING FORWARD YOUR- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING IT BACK TO THAT IT'S OVER SO I WILL JUST FOCUS ON- FUELS REDUCTION AND- AND PRESCRIBED BURNING SPECIFICALLY TO THIS- PROPOSAL. WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY AND WE'VE BEEN HOLDING- VERY CLOSELY TO OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS IS MEETING A YEAR OF- FORTY FIVE. THOUSAND ACRES OF TREATMENT BY CAL FIRE STAFFED SO WE'RE WORKING TOWARD AN OVERALL GOAL ON PRIVATE LANDS OF A HALF A MILLION ACRES A YEAR. FOR SERVICE IS DOING THE SAME ON THE FEDERAL LANDS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR CAL FIRE SPECIFICALLY TO BE- IN CHARGE OF AN INVOLVED IN DOING THOSE THOSE. CRITICAL ACRES IS SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES SO WERE TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY THERE- ONE OF THE- MAJOR. COINS THAT WE NEED TO GET OVER THE HURDLES WE NEED TO GET OVER IS HAVING PERMANENT STAFF. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ENTRUSTED BY THEIR COMMUNITIES WHAT HAPPENS IS WITH THE TRANSIENT WORKFORCE THAT COMES AND GOES DURING PEAK FIRE SEASON- AND THEN INTO THE SHOULDER SEASONS. THEY MAKE THEY MAKE- SURFACE LEVEL I'LL CALL THEM- RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY WITH RANCHERS WITH FOREST LANDOWNERS WITH- OPEN SPACE. GROUPS AND WHEN WE MOVED TO A PERMANENT WORK FORCE AND THIS IS BEEN SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY WE BECOME PART OF THE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE SHOWING UP FOR WORK A YEAR ROUND AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MEETING WITH PEOPLE AT AT TOWN HALL MEETINGS- THEY'RE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY DOING DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS TALKING WITH INDIVIDUALS. ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS WELL TO BE A PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEN TO BUILD THE TRUST THAT IS. NEEDED TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS THIS PIECE OF THESE PERSONNEL WILL GET US FROM THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY TREATING TO THE SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES WE'RE WE'RE- INTENDING TO TREAT. BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. X. HELLO THANK YOU FOR THAT INSIGHT- WE ARE OVERTIME ON THIS ITEM IF YOU HAVE VERY SHORT CENTER DOLLY. I'M I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP THE TO THE CHIEF. DO ARE YOU ABLE TO ASSIST. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS IN TO GET THAT GOAL YOU'RE MEETING I KNOW THAT- AS A FARMER WE CAN DO NAG BURN BUT THEY DON'T ASSIST AS THEY COME OUT LOOK AT IT AND THEN WE'RE ON OUR OWN AND THERE'S A LOT OF RISK IN THAT. ARE YOU ABLE TO ASSIST THOSE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO DO THOSE BURNS. YES WE ARE AND AS THE AS WE HAVE MORE STAFF WILL BE MORE AND MORE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT- THE CALIPH UTP. THAT'S THE VEGETATION TROPE. TREATMENT PROGRAMMATIC E. I. R. THAT WAS JUST PASSED THROUGH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY- BACK IN JANUARY THAT IS THAT THE- TEARING DOCUMENT THAT WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO USE. TO BURN ON. A STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS- AND WE'RE ALSO AND WE ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM OF. BUILDING OUT- PRESCRIBED FIRE SPECIALISTS IN THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY THERE WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE. FOR LANDOWNERS TO USE AND WE'RE WORKING ON AN INSURANCE. PROGRAM THAT WILL BE BACK IN SOME WAY BY THE STATE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THOSE. THOSE PRIVATE BURNERS HAVE THE BACKING OF THE STATE IN DOING GOOD WORK AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET US CENTER REQUIRE VERY SHORTLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF THIS ADDRESS TWO QUICK. QUESTIONS TO THE CHIEF AND THEN. ALSO A QUICK COMMENT I THINK PANDEMIC OR NO PANDEMIC. THAT WE LIVE IN THIS ERA IS. THE CHAIR HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THIS FOR THE PAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. ERROR OF MAYO WHILE THEN FIRES MEANS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WITH CAL FIRE THEY'RE- STILL UNDERSTAFFED FROM WHEN THEY HIT THEIR PEAK. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND ALSO UNDERSTAND. THE NEED. FOR THE ADDITIONAL PERMANENT. TO FOR THE CHIEF CHAIR. NUMBER ONE CAN YOU PLEASE ADDRESS THE CONTRACTED TECHNO SILVA THAT AND TALK ABOUT THE SUCCESS THAT YOU'VE SEEN. CHIEF WITH THIS- EARLY ADOPTION LAST YEAR I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE IN REGARDS TO WHAT YOU CAN DO. ON TACTICS WERE WHETHER IT'S RESOURCES STRATEGY EVACUATION% PLANNING. AND THE SECOND PIECE IS CHIEF IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF. WHAT YOU REALLY DO NEED TO HIT STRIDE UNDERSTANDING. WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW TO ONE YEAR NOT FULL FUNDING DOES THAT MAKE SENSE LOOKING AS WE MOVE DOWN THE ROAD TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THE FIVE I JUST WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT. CHIEF. HE FORGOT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR YES- I MEAN I'M GONNA HIT THE SECOND PIECE FIRST- SO HITTING STRIDE- WE BUILT THIS- THIS MAY WRITE REVISE PROPOSAL. TO MEET THE ABILITY TO TRAIN AND TO GET PERMANENT- FIREFIGHTERS INTO SEATS. SO YOU'LL NOTE THAT THERE THERE WAS- AN AUGMENTATION AND- JESSICA PETERS MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE A SEASONAL COMPONENT. THAT IS IN THE END THIS YEAR THAT WILL HELP US MEET THIS YEAR'S- SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE- AND THEN AS YOU SEE OVER THE SUCCESS OF YOURS THAT SEASONAL COMPONENT STARTS TO. DISSOLVE AND BECOME PERMANENT. AND SO THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS IT HELPS TO KEEP. KEEP THE MOMENTUM MOVING FORWARD AS WE ADD THE PERMANENT STAFF GOING GOING DOWNSTREAM. IF WE DON'T AT THE PERMANENT STAFF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF COMING BACK ANNUALLY ASKING FOR AUGMENTATION. TO PUT THOSE ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ON ENGINES- TO HELP WITH THE- THE WORKER BEES THE FIRE THAT THAT THE- WHAT I CALLED THE HOST DRAGONS AND TOOLS WINGERS- BUT WE WON'T BE. BE BUILDING THE NEEDED COMPANY OFFICER THAT IS INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT WORKER. WHO CAN MAKE DECISIONS YOU CAN. ALL THIS ON THE FLY LINES. THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE LOST IF WE DON'T MAKE A COMMITMENT TO HIRING THESE POSITIONS OVER TIME SO. WE NEED. THREE YEARS TO GET TO STRIDE AND WE NEED THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE OF THE PROPOSAL TO. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SOLIDIFIED OUR POSITION AND WERE WE WERE. READY FOR THE CHALLENGES SO. THAT'S THAT'S MY ANSWER FOR THE SECOND PIECE FIRST PIECE- TECHNO SOBER VERY QUICKLY BY KNOWING THAT THAT'S A SEPARATE- BUDGET PROPOSAL- THAT'S THE RFI TO OUR- IN OUR INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT- WE HAVE SEEN. FAIRY IMPRESSIVE- USE OF THAT PRODUCT. LAST YEAR WE HAD IT FOR ABOUT THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF THE SEASON. SEVERAL FIRES- EVERY FIRE THAT OCCURRED DURING THAT PERIOD- WAS IDENTIFIED IN THEIR MODEL AND THEN GROWN TO ITS POTENTIAL- ONE- SPECIFIC. EXAMPLE IS THE MARINA FIRE IN VENTURA COUNTY WITHIN MINUTES OF THAT FIRE STARTING- THAT- IT WAS MODELED BY THE TECHNO SILVER PRODUCT. AND WE HAD MAPS IN HAND THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. ON SCREEN. THAT WHERE THAT FIRE WOULD BE A SIXTY HOURS. AND WHAT IS YOUR COMMENTS AND ISSUE NUMBER THREE THREE ZERO WHICH IS THE NEXT ONE WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE AHEAD OF OURSELVES LET'S KEEP EXPANDING- CALENDAR THANK YOU CHIEF- SO. THAT'S ITEM ISSUE NUMBER THREE TWO NINE AND WE KNOW WE COULD WE'RE ALL INVOLVED IN THIS AND CAN TALK ABOUT- FOUR I NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE ADDITIONAL TIME LET'S MOVE TO- THE- INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT ISSUE NUMBER. THREE THREE ZERO WE'VE HEARD FROM THE- CHIEF. AS FINDING. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF JUST A YEAH WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO DO FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS GENTLEMAN USING YOUR TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE BIG DRIVERS ARE GREAT JOB OF- INTRODUCING TO YOU- THIS INFORMATION IT LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE SUPER CRITICAL BEING ABLE TO HEAR REAL TIME.

ANYWAY MR BENTSEN YOUR OKAY ABOUT GIVEN THOSE REPORTS THE LEGISLATURES ELIO HAS OUTLINED IN THEIR- COMMENTS. YES WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'RE DOWN UNIVERSITY DOCUMENTS YOU GET MOST RESPONSIVE STEP TWO THEN WE WILL WE'LL SHARE SOME DOCUMENTS- IF NOT TODAY TOMORROW. X. MISS PETER. BELIAU THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND AS YOU JUST MENTIONED AND THAT WE DO SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GET THE REPORTS FROM THE PROOF OF CONCEPT EVALUATION AS YOUR MEMBER AND THE FUNDING HERE IS REALLY STARTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- THROUGH AN INNOVAIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHERE- DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE TYPE OF THE PROCESS THAT WAS BEING SENT I AM THE MINISTER SHE WASN'T REALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE VERY MUCH INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON. THE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY IT MIGHT BE PROCURING AND SO THE LEGISLATURE HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR STOCK HASN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SEE AND ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION THAT WAS CONDUCTED IT HAS THAT ADMINISTRATIONS INDICATED IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A VERY PROMISING TECHNOLOGY- THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED HERE- IT WOULD SUPPORT AT THREE TO FIVE YEAR CONTRACT THAT'S IN IN ENTERED INTO BUT THE FINDINGS PROVIDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND SO BEFORE YOU CAN BE ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE THINK THAT YOU JUST WANT TO SEE ON THE SAME REPORT SO YOU CAN FEEL AS AS CONFIDENT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE USED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS THE MINISTRATION. WE KERR MEMBERS OKAY SEEMS STRAIGHTFORWARD LET'S MOVE ON TO THIS- ISSUES WE PATCH THEM ISSUES THREE TH THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE TO THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE DOES THE FISH. AND WILDLIFE. LOTS OF MOVE LOTS AND BY. DOWN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS LET'S HAVE FINANCE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING SERGIO AGUILAR WITH A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF MOVIES COMPONENTS THE PROPOSAL- WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA KIND OF GO OVER IT A HIGH LEVEL SO. YOUR BROWSER IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- GENERAL AND STATE OPERATIONS WERE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE THIS REPRESENTS A NINE POINT THREE. MILLION DOLLAR- DECREASED OR SEVEN POINT 2% COMPARED TO THAT POINT I DECIDED I'D LEVEL WHEN. LOOKING AT THE DEPARTMENT. BEING THE SPECIAL FIND THIS. A ONE POINT BUDGET ACT. OUR VISION OF CONTINUES THE LOCAL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WOULD STAND AS A GENERAL FUND TRANSFERRED FROM THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND HOWEVER IN ADDITION WE ARE PROPOSING NEW CRITICAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH I NEVER. FUN AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE AN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND TRANSFER OF. EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ODDS ARE THAT YOU. I INDIA I'M THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING. THERE IS INCLUDED THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BASELINE REDUCTION THE PART OF CHRISTIAN WILDLIFE BUDGET OUT VERY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE- EIGHT POINT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS YET- I WILL KNOW THAT WE DID INCLUDE THAT THIRTY THREE POINTS AND THAT PART OF THE FEDERAL TRIGGER. THE THEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT- BETTER RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED- THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RESTORE THAT THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN. MILLION BASED ON REDUCTION AND YOU KNOW BUT- THAT WOULD RESTORE THE BASE I DON'T KNOW JEN BUT THEN ALSO PROVIDES. SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE MOVIE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT- AND WE ALSO HAVE GREATER. BOTTOM LINES ON THE LINE. THE QUESTION. WE FORGET TO DIRECTED BY YOU KNOW OUR STAFF IN THE LEGISLATE COUNCIL'S TALKED ABOUT SINCE WE THE LIFE OF HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND THIS IS GOING TO BE A FOUR FIFTHS VOTE IN ORDER TO TAKE BACK THE THIRTY MILLION THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME TO THE FUN. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. YES WE HAVE HAD RECENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE- THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND WE ARE AWARE THAT THEY ARE. PUTTING UP FOR BOTH WRESTLED- IN THE MERE VISION- CRADLE BILL- SO- I WOULD KNOW THAT. WE WERE CLOSE THERE'S STILL A PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION MAJOR VISION. AND B. OF THE MAJOR REVISION FURTHER BUILT- IF THAT IS REJECTED THE AFFECTED THEY IS EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION SHARES. THE W. C. T. AND THEN. BE EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION WOULD BE REDUCED FROM ARTIFICIAL LIFE LIKE IT. BETTER BE BETTER WE'RE KNOWLEDGE- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE MOST RECENT. POSITION THAT THERE MAY BE CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS. ON THE PROPOSAL BETWEEN. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A THIS. BUT BELIAU ONLINE AT READ. THANK ARE YOU THERE MORNING EHLERS WITH THE LEGEND OFFICE- WE HAVE THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PIECES HERE- ON ON THIS I THINK THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE OF SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA IS HELPFUL I THINK THERE ARE THREE COMMENTS WE WOULD MAKE FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THE FIRST IS AROUND THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND IS THE CHAIR MENTIONED AND- THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT THAT EVEN IN JANUARY WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD FROM WHERE THE FUNDS WILL BE TRANSFERRED. NOW WITH THE FORCES THOUGH FRESH OLD IT GETS EVEN HARDER SO- THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO PURSUE AND IS THAT SOMETHING EVEN FEASIBLE TO PURSUE I THINK THE SECOND AS MR BROWN. USING RESOURCES THAT IS BEING PROPOSED FOR A BASELINE KINDS OF THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PARKS IS THE OTHER WHICH I'LL GET TO IN YOUR AGENDA SO IS THAT SOMETHING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO DO YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LOT OF CLARIFICATION OVER HOW THOSE CUTS WOULD BE TAKEN AT THE DEPARTMENT THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING THAT THEY WOULD LOOK. AT WAYS THROUGH USING THEIR SERVICE BASE BUDGET BUT THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE YOU A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACTS OF THESE CUTS WOULD BE IF YOU TOOK THEM. AND THEY ARE BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THE FEDERAL TRIGGER BUT THAT WOULD JUST BE IF WE GOT FEDERAL FUNDS ONE TIME SO AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR THIS WOULD BECOME BASELINE CUTS. AND MORE- SIGNIFICANT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE H. C. F. TRANSFERRED HELP OFFSET THEM. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME AUGMENTATIONS BEING PROPOSED HERE AS WEL SIX POINT TWO MILLION IN TOTAL FOUR MILLION FOR- GETTING CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE INITIATIVE. AND TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR LANCE MANAGEMENT WELL THOSE EFFORTS MAY HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AND THEY'RE NOT HUGE DOLLAR AMOUNTS YOU KNOW WE JUST WOULD WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO AUGMENT PROGRAMS AT THE SAME TIME. YOU'RE BEING PROPOSED TO CUT PROGRAMS AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S PRIORITIZING NEW EXPANDED EFFORTS OVER SOME EXISTING EFFORTS AND IS THAT- AND APPROACH YOU WANT TO TAKE. DIRECTED BY. HOLDING OFF ON THE BASELINE CUTS FOR A MINUTE CAN YOU ADDRESS THE- THE CUTTING GREEN TAPE AND- THE- THE- FUND LAND MANAGEMENT AUGMENTATIONS. MR GOOD MORNING IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND ALL THE MEMBERS EVEN UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO LET ME FIRST START WITH THE CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE CONCEPT WHICH IS A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR CONTINUATION OF A PROPOSAL COMING OUT OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. THIS IS GOOD WORK IT'S SMART WORK IT ACTUALLY MAY BE MORE STRATEGIC WORK NOW IF ONE THINKS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE STIMULUS. RESTARTING THE ECONOMY AND PUTTING ENERGY INTO GREEN JOBS. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT APARTMENT IS WHERE ONE OF THE- GATEWAY FUNDERS FOR RESTORATION WORK ACROSS THE WORLD LANDSCAPE AS WELL AS A PRIMARY PERMIT OR OF THOSE RESTORATION PROJECTS THE THINGS THAT MAKE A RIVER HEALTHIER. THE THINGS THAT OUR INVESTMENTS TO BRING BACK OUR SALMON THE THINGS THAT ARE FOR RESTORING WETLANDS SO THIS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. WOULD ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE SCALE AND PACE OF RESTORATION WORK. INCORPORATE INEFFICIENCIES INTO OUR GRANT MAKING SO WE CAN KEEP. MOVING PROPOSITION FUNDS OUT TO OUR NONPROFIT AND TRIBAL PARTNERS AND PURSUE PROGRAMMATIC PERMITTING OPTIONS THEY CAN GET ALL OF THIS GOOD WORK DONE FASTER. NOW IT MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S NEW WORK BUT WE DO A LOT OF THIS WORK ALREADY AND I WOULD ARGUE IT'S POSSIBLE THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BECOMES AN OPTIMIZATION. RATHER THAN AN ENTIRELY NEW KIND OF WAR. THAT'S THE CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE ASPECT. ON THE LANDS FRONT THE TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN MY JUDGMENT IS A PRUDENT INVESTMENT NO MATTER THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE HERE'S WHY. OUR DEPARTMENT OWNS AND MANAGES ABOUT A MILLION ACRES ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE FROM OUR SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EFFORT IS ARE. LESS THAN SUPERIOR ABILITY TO MANAGE THOSE LANDS FOR THEIR FUTURE USE. THEIR CLIMATE UP THE ADAPTABILITY THEIR RESILIENCY THIS TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH LET US KEEP DOING IMPORTANT LANCE MAINTENANCE OF OUR OWN PROPERTIES WITH AN EYE TOWARDS THAT CLIMB. HI EXCELLENT WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS SPENT SOME. HOURS ON THAT SERVICE SPACE- MANAGEMENT AND I KNOW THAT ALL THE MEMBERS KNOW MORE ABOUT A GAUGE STREAM- TESTING THEN THEY THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL RIGHT MEMBERS DON'T SEE ANY. COMMENTS CENTER STERN JUST VERY BRIEFLY- I KNOW WE TOUCHED ON THE- GREEN TAPE INITIATIVE BUT- HI THIS IS A BIT OF A HOBSON'S CHOICE HERE AT NIGHT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ONE ALTHOUGH THE FOUR FIFTHS VOTE THRESHOLD DOES END UP BECOMING VALIDATED THEN THAT'LL OBVIOUSLY GIVE THE LEGISLATURE AN OPPORTUNITY- PINE ON RESCINDING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS TO FULLY FUND THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND THAT pTHE LEGISLATURE ALSO SPOKE LAST YEAR AND IT SEEMS TO CONTRAVENE. OUR INTENT AND IT'S NO. DIRECT CRITIQUE OF DIRECTOR BONHAM OR CDFW IN FACT YOU GUYS ARE STILL UNDER RESOURCE. BUT ROBBING FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL OR TO KEEP ALL THESE PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING SEEMS LIKE A FALSE CHOICE AT THIS POINT SO I I'D LOVE TO SEE. SOME FUTURE CONSIDERATION OF RESTORING THESE FUNDS- AND REALLY VALIDATING THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE CRITICAL IMPACT THEY HAVE ON. ON THE STATE OR WE CAN OVERSEE HIM A MASS EXTINCTION EVENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE NEXT DECADE BUT- THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE PERFECTLY GOOD CHOICE EITHER. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD IT OPEN OBVIOUSLY. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OVERTIME THIS COMING WEEK- LET'S MOVE TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT'S BEING CUT AT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE BASELINE- BUDGET WHICH IS PARKS AND RECREATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHO ARE THE FOLKS ONLINE NOW READ ITEM NUMBER THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO. WHICH IS. THE PARKS RECREATION BUDGET CUTS LET'S HEAR FROM MITCH SCHAEFER SHOPPER FROM THE PART OF FINANCE YES CAN YOU HEAR ME CHARTERED PARKING LANES. GO AHEAD OKAY AS NOTED ON THE AGENDA AND THE BUDGET INCLUDES- TWO PROPOSALS ONE IS A SATISFYING FOR THE PART OF PARKS AND RECREATION OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND FIFTY MILLION IN THEIR CURRENT YEAR AND A HUNDRED IN EACH YEAR THEY SET ASIDE- WHOSE MAJOR ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PARKS HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHITE CLOSURES- THE EXACT IMPACT OF THESE REDUCTIONS IS THAT I KNOW NOW I'M OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S ALSO HEAVILY IMPACTED BY A HOW QUICKLY. PARK SCANNING EACH USE RESTRICTIONS IN A MANNER THAT STILL CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC- HELLO ORDERS AND AN ACCIDENT THERE IS WHEN NAV ACTION OF THE BUDGET AND OTHER- IT'S NOTED AS A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING CHANNEL FIND REDUCTION- THAT WOULD BE A TRIGGER REDUCTION AS NOTED AND- DOT INSTEAD SIMPLY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT ADDITIONAL- ONGOING EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS WILL NEED TO BE MADE. PARKS. AND WE'LL BE WORKING. VERY CLOSELY. WITH LOCAL FEDERAL AND COPPER. AND USING SERVICE BUDGETING MODEL AND TO ADDRESS HOW NEEDS AND WANTS TERM. PROGRAMMING WOULD BE ME. I'M STILL OVER MISSED THE THINK THAT MILLION THIS YEAR AS OF OR IS IT AT THE CEILING OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN- I'D APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION A RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON. AND IN A TYPICAL YEAR HOW MUCH OF THE REVENUES INTO THE STATE PARKS AND RECREATION FIND HIGH MAN FINE LINE. AND IT'S NOT AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT AND GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE REVENUES THAT CURRYING ARE GOING TO BE IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS LIKELY TO BE SOME MORE INFORMATION THAT COMES TO LIGHT IN THE COMING WEEKS. AND THAT MIGHT HELP YOU REFINE THE ESTIMATE AND IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD BE SOMEWHAT LAST IT COULD BE HIGHER AND- BUT IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD BE LESS AS WELL WHICH MIGHT BE ABLE TO FREE UP SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED- BEFORE BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YOUR PERKS BACKFILL THAT CERTAINLY THE CURRENT YEAR THERE SHOULD BE MORE INFORMATION COMING TO LIGHT. YEAH AND OUR STAFF REPORT RECOMMENDS THE FUNDING TO BACK FILL HOLDING OFF THE TRIGGER BUDGET CUTS SO WHEN WE- IF WE WHEN WE CONSIDER BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE IN JULY WE'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW THAT SEASON IS GOING AROUND. THE RECOVERY- LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FIFTY PARKS PEOPLE. GOING OUT TO THE PARKS. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MR CHAIR IF I COULDN'T- JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON THE ON THE TRIGGER CUT SO YES WE ARE AND SO JUST TO KNOW THAT IT'S PROPOSED FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR NOT THE UPCOMING YEAR STARTING JULY ONE AND WELL IT'S DESCRIBED IN THE BUDGET SUMMARY THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ATTACKED TECHNICAL N. AS IN IN THE BUDGET TO ACTUALLY EFFECTUATE THE CUT. IN ADDITION THAT THAT TRIGGERING OFF MECHANISM RELATED TO GETTING FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS I'M ARMOR STANDING AS APPLIES ONLY TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR AND SO IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO APPLY TO PARKS AS WELL AND SO WE THINK THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY ACTION YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY THE PROPOSAL EVEN IS RELATED TO THE PARK'S TRIGGER KITE IS OUR TECHNICAL MECHANISM IN THE BUDGET TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT TAX CUTS- AND THEN IS THERE A MECHANISM TO IMPLEMENT THE TRIGGERING COST- AND JUST YOUR STAFF. AGENDA NOTES IN SORT OF SIMILAR TO WHAT WE START WITH THE- DFW CATS AND YOU MAY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS THAT AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT GOES THROUGH TO DEVELOPED WHAT REDUCTIONS THAT WOULD MAKE ALSO LIGNS WITH YOUR OWN PRIORITIES AND YOU MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN ON FRAMING PROCESS LOOKS LIKE DR COMMAND A MAN GET OVER- SOMEBODY AT THE PARKS YOU. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE- ALLEY OTHERS ASSESSMENT. SURE LISA I GET MISDIRECT. OF THE OF PARKS REC I THINK I AGREE WITH THE FRAMING THAT WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH- KIND F IN THIS POINT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE WORKING ON LOOSENING THE RESTRICTIONS- WE ARE AS AS WE- SPEAKING TODAY WE'VE GOT ROUGHLY HALF OF THE STATE PARK SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE REOPENED- PARKING LOT. AND YOU'LL- SEE THAT IN THE NEXT COMING WEEKS WE EXPECT TO LOOSEN UP EVEN MORE OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS. AS YOU'RE AWARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. OF OUR FUNDING BASE COMES FROM- CAMPING RESERVATIONS LARGE GATHERINGS LIKE WEDDINGS AND CONCERTS- A DANCE. THAT MAY HAPPEN IN OUR PARKS MUSEUMS IN ADDITION TO- ACTUAL GATE FEES. SO A LOT OF FACTORS AT PLAY- WE COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH NOT ONLY YOUR STAFF AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AS WE CONTINUE TO WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND THE FISCAL IMPACT NOT ONLY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. BUT ALSO- THE BUDGET YEAR. IN TERMS OF I THINK THE ELIAN HAD RAISED SOME SOME CONCERNS OR COMMENTS RELATIVE TO. HELLO TO KIND OF FLASHING A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE THINK A SAVINGS PLAN MIGHT LOOK LIKE- I THINK AS YOU FOLKS KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TREMENDOUS PARTNERS WITH US OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS WE HAVE MADE VERY STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE PARK SYSTEM- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. WELL IT HELPED TO GUIDE OUR INVESTMENTS. IT'S ALSO GOING TO HELP US TO USE MORE OF A SURGICAL- VERY REFINED APPROACH IN FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS R. AS WE DESIGN A SAVINGS PLAN. IN TERMS OF WHAT DOESN'T ENGAGEMENT LOOK LIKE- THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP- WE HAD LOTS OF PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH THE PARKS AD REC COMMISSION. ON TO DISCUSS HOW. WE WOULD INVEST THOSE FUNDS THE ANSWER WE WILL TO MAKE. IN THAT SAME PROCESS. AS OU KNOW THE PARKS AND REC COMMISSION IS A PUBLIC MEETING YOU HAVE ON WHAT ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS IS A DESIGNEES. ON THAT COMMISSION THEIR PUBLIC SO WE EXPECT TO BEFORE WE ACTUALLY EXECUTE. TO BE BEFORE- THAT BODY AND BEING TRANSPARENT IN SHARING- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SAVINGS PLAN JUST AS THE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE'VE BUILT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE NOTION. OF ACCESS. ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC- WE'RE GOING TO LEAN ON THAT VERY STRONG- SIMILAR PARTNERSHIP AS WE GO FORWARD. AND OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU IS THAT IT'S- FOR ALL OF OUR SPENDING PLAN OR SAVINGS PLAN IT'S NOT JUST US- THE ITEM BEFORE YOU TODAY. BUT RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THERE'S A FIVE PERCENT- SAVINGS PLAN THAT APPLIES TO ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS AND WE EXPECTING TO MEANT TO BE SHARING THAT WITH- WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ALSO. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION CENTER DOLLY RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THIS IS. I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED SO. WE'VE BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS. WERE BUT TRYING TO BUDGET ON THAN JUST A GENERAL QUESTION I DON'T KNOW YOU CAN AS A WE KNOW THAT IN. PLACES WHERE THE BEARS HAVEN'T HAPPENED IN THAT WE'VE LOST MONEY. NOW WE'RE WE'RE COMING INTO AT LEAST IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE THE IN THE SUMMER TIME WHERE WE'RE GONNA SEE. HOPEFULLY ARE SOME PARKS OPEN PEOPLE CAN USE THEM TO WORK AND THEN. SO WITH THAT SO THERE'S GONNA BE SOME. INTERACTIONS TO WORK IT IS VERY. DIFFICULT TO TRY TO BUDGET BETTER SCENARIO WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS SO. WE'RE WE'RE SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO GET SOME FEDERAL MONEY COMING BACK ON AND ALL THESE BUDGET ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE OR MAYBE THE LA O'S OFFICE CAN HELP ME OUT OR SOMEBODY. CAN GIVE ME THE INFORMATION THAT. HOW DO WE RECTIFY. WHEN WE GET MAYBE 75% OF THE RESOURCES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT KICK IN BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HOW HAVE YOU PLAYED THAT IN YOUR BUDGET PROCESS. THIRTY ONE TAKE THAT. ACTUALLY I THINK THAT STRIKES ME AS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN SPEAK TO A LITTLE MORE BROADLY. IT CERTAINLY. OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES WE ARE TRACKING- THE RESPONSE COSTS AND IT HAD ASSUMED INTERNALLY REVISION A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS SO THAT. NOT ONLY THAT 7525% REIMBURSEMENT ON THE RIVER TO SENATOR BUT ALSO TRYING TO TRACK. CHILDREN ALLOCATE FOR THE KRONOS VIRUS RELIEF FUNDS AS WELL SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CREATE. THE REVISION. WHO DETERMINES. THE JUSTIFICATION OF WHAT GETS PAID WHAT DOESN'T GET PAID. THE OFFICE OF THE REGENCY SERVICES OUR PRIMARY CONNECTION TO THAT. ARE YOU NOT AND SO THEY ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM TO KIND OF DETERMINE WHAT IS PMR REIMBURSABLE DURING DURING THIS EVENT AND SO THEY ARE WORKING ON THAT HARD AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF ENTITIES LOOKING AT POTENTIAL FEDERAL PLANS FROM THE RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION. NINETEEN SO THERE IS AN. EFFORT TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDING. YOU CAN USE. AND I HAVE YOU TO INTO CONSIDERATION. THE AMOUNT THAT WILL BE RECEIVING IN IN THESE BUT AND GIVEN OUT OUT TO EACH DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR FOR THEIR PURPOSE OF DEBT OF BUDGETING. YES WE ARE TRYING TO TRACK. THOSE EXPENDITURES FROM VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. AND IT IS ONE OF THEM BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF APARTMENTS THAT ARE. BEIJING COMING NINETEEN LATER RESPONSE COSTS AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE EXPENDITURES AND HOW THEY ALLOCATE TO THEM AND HOW WE ASSUME THAT YOU ARE REIMBURSEMENT. SO WHERE WOULD WE SEE THAT INFORMATION. SO THAT WE CAN THEN SEE WHAT'S GOING TO BE. WE'RE PROJECTED TO BE REIMBURSED VERSUS THE ACTUAL BUDGET. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CAN DO AFTER THIS HEARING IS FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR BUDGET STAFF AND SENT IN A RECENT LETTER THAT WE- SENT OUT ON. THURSDAY OR FRIDAY FRIDAY- THAT TRIES TO LAY OUT. EXPENDITURE PLAN AS WELL AS OUR ASSUMPTIONS ON REIMBURSEMENT SO I WILL. THE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU HAVE A COPY OF THAT HELPS DISPLACE SOMEBODY THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE EXPENDITURE AND- THOSE ARE THE REAL. ART TO THIS BUDGET THEN WOULD BE TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S NOT BEEN RE REIMBURSED AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S ACTUAL IN WHAT'S REIMBURSED AND THEN THE REVENUE- LOSS PROJECTION I GUESS I AM FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT- FOR FUTURE BUDGETING WE KNOW THAT THE ECONOMY IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE IN A DOWNTURN. IN FUTURE IN. THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE BUT WILL HAVE THE QUITE A BIT OF IT RESOURCES FOR THIS ONE TIME- REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEMA FOLKS AND SO THAT INFORMATION IS GONNA BE CRITICAL ON HOW WE- LOOK AT AT TWO TO THREE YEAR BUDGETING SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CAL FIRE. STUFF IS GOING TO BE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IS HE IS. IS CRITICAL TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE FEMA REIMBURSEMENT IS SO THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO HER THREE YEARS. VERY GOOD WE'LL STAY ON TOP OF THAT ALL RIGHT- SEE NO OTHER HANDS UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE FINANCE IN A- AT THE DEPARTMENT BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO HI ISSUE NUMBER THREE FORTY THREE WHICH SUSTAINABLE GROUND MANAGEMENT ACT. THIS IS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. IS A- NOTED ON PAGE ONE FIFTEEN THIS IS TO. THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE THAT IT MAY REVISE PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THIRTY MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL. THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABLE AGENCIES- FOR SEGMENTATION FOR THE PROJECT BUT TO REJECT THE MAY REVISE PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND ON GOING ON THE SIX MONTH LET'S HAVE. MISTER AGUILAR FROM FINANCE ONCE YOU GO AHEAD. REGULAR PART OF FINANCE YEAH THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T PROPOSE TO WITHDRAWAL THE ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDES FUNDING OR STAFFING AND ALSO FUNDING FOR GRANTS- WE WILL KNOW THAT THE STATE DOES REMAIN COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THEIR TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER USE AND SO TO THAT END WE ARE. PUSHING FORWARD SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AT FIFTY EIGHT MONEY- TO SUPPORT THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS TO DEFRAY THEIR COST OF STIGMA IMPLEMENTATION OUTSIDE GONNA BE UP RECORDS THAT THE BUDGET YEAR- ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT RECOMMENDATION AND ALL WILL NOTICE. OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NOTWITHSTANDING YOU'RE NOT A CRITICAL POSITION TO EXPAND PROGRAMS AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE- DRASTIC. BUDGET ACCOMMODATION RECESSION. THE AUDIO. MICHELLE THANK YOU MR CHAIR HI AGAIN RACHEL IT WITH THE I OUR CONCERN HERE AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA IS JUST AROUND THE STAFFING IN THE STATE OPERATIONS EVEN THOUGH IN JANUARY THIS WAS PORTRAYED AS AN AUGMENTATION AND A GROWING OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF IN FACT THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF LIMITED TERM FUNDING THAT'S ABOUT TO EXPIRE AND SO IF THIS PROPOSAL AT LEAST PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL ISN'T PROPOSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE- MAKING REDUCTIONS TO THEIR SICKNESS STAFFING IN STING OPERATIONS AT A TIME. THAT THIS STATE IS REALLY RAMPING UP SOME OF THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OR THE PARTNER WILL NEED TO REVIEW PLANS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO I THINK OUR CONCERNS ARE JUST- YOU KNOW WELL THEY WILL THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT AND CAN WE EFFECTIVELY MEET THIS IMPORTANT STATE PRIORITY SO- YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING A PORTION OF THE FUNDING NOT ALL OF THE FUNDING BUT- I THINK OUR OUR CONCERNS ARE JUST. CAN WE ACHIEVE THIS IMPORTANT STATE PRIORITY WHEN THE DEPARTMENT WILL. BE IN A POSITION OF MAKING A REDUCTION. YEAH SHE- REPORT ARE. INDICATE WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED EIGHTY MILLION FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND FOR THIS PREVIOUSLY IN THIS IS WORK THAT. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE OUR CONCERN WITH. ANYBODY AT THE DEPARTMENT. ONE COMMENT. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS TIRING REPRESENTING A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF STATEWIDE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND- WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THAT CHALLENGING TIMES THAT WE'RE IN AND- PRECIADO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S POSITION AND SUPPORT THAT POSITION. WE AS THE PERMANENT FINANCE MENTIONED WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING OUR- ABILITY TO SUPPORT THAT LOCAL GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT WE WILL BE RE PRIORITIZING- ALL OF OUR- KIND OF HURTS BUT TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS. SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING ITS STATUTORY AND REGULATORY DEADLINES AND SO WE'LL BE FOCUSING ON THAT- BUT REMAINING COMMITTED TO LOCAL PROVIDING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND THAT LOCAL ASSISTANCE I WILL NOT WILL NOT BE STOPPING BUT WE WILL BE NEEDING TO DO SIRI PARTICIPATION. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO- THAT'S A SEPARATE STATION AS YOU KNOW I'VE PREVIOUSLY COMMENT YOU'RE PRIORITIZING- HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SAFE DRINKING WATER AND SAYING THAT THAT HAS TO BE FUNDED BUT THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE GENERAL FUND. YOU'RE REDUCING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BASIC WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE ON GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT SO. WE'RE THESE DIFFICULT TIMES WE'RE DEALING WITH ALL THESE DIFFICULT ISSUES ONE BY ONE- MEMBERS QUESTIONS. OF THE DEPARTMENT EARLIER WHEN THIS. SINISTER AND QUICKLY VERY QUICKLY YET THANK YOU I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE ON THE- AGAIN CONCERNING SAME OVERALL THEME- APPRECIATE THE REJECTION THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE ON GOING BUT- OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT WE APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR HOW HOW MUCH- IS ON TRACK TO GET ALLOCATED TO THE GSA'S THIS YEAR JUST ONE TRY TO GET A SENSE OF HOW HOW MANY DOLLARS WE'RE- PLANNING TO GET OUT THE DOOR THIS YEAR UNDER LAST YEAR'S DOLLARS. THIS RAISES ANY. REV AS ANY. THANK YOU YES- THE EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- ALLOCATE TWENTY SIX MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS AND IT WILL NEED TO BE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT- REQUIREMENTS- BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT AND GET THOSE AT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OUT TO CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASES OUT BEFORE THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR. OKAY TO BE CONTINUED THANK YOU LET'S MOVE TO THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD THIS IS. ISSUE NUMBER THREE FOUR FOUR- WE HAVE A STAFF RECOMMENDATION WE'RE TRYING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW AND GET THE- RESOURCE BOARD TO CONSIDER REGULATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CAP AND TRADE WERE- YOU KNOW WE'RE AN ADAPTIVE COMMUNITY SO WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE ONTO THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE. DATA MARKET REGISTRY DATABASE SO- FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING 212% OKAY THE ACTING ADAMS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A CLASS INCREMENTAL INCREASES ONE POINT ONE MILLION HOWEVER IT'S ONLY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR OUT AT THE COST OF MAKING IMPLEMENTATION. HE'S OVER A FIVE YEAR. FOR MEMBERSHIP SERVICES INTO THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE. REQUEST DOES INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW THEIR RESEARCH IS WORKING TO PROVIDE ADVANCE PAYMENT I THINK 25% OF THEIR QUARTERLY MEMBERSHIP COSTS. INTO THE WESTERN CLAIM THAT SHE- EARLIER DID YOU GET THE INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT ON THE I. T. R. SYSTEM IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO HEAR. YEAH MISTER OSTROM WITH L. L. AGAIN- WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS KIND OF THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT AND REQUESTED RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT KIND OF UPGRADE AND DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM I THINK OUR MAIN ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO FLAG WAS JUST ONE OF. OVERSIGHT THIS IS A BIT OF AN UNUSUAL SITUATION WHERE THE REQUEST IS BEING MADE BY THE AIRPORT THE NEW- FOR SIGNS FOR THE NEW I. T. PROJECTS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEING DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY- THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ENTITY THAT. ADMINISTERS THE AUCTIONS AND SO. AS A RESULT IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE NORMAL KIND OF STATES- REVIEW PROCESS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT PRESENTS I'M SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOME ADDITIONAL- OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING YOUR BUDGET NO LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE UPDATES AS THE PROJECT MOVES ALONG AND ANY CHANGES THAT MIGHT OCCUR ALONG THE WAY. YEAH SO I'M I'M I'M WITH YOU TRYING TO- YOU KNOW IMPROVED THE SUPPORT FOR THE CAP AND TRADE% PROGRAM IN AND WORKING WITH THE AIRPORT IN AND GIVING THAT OVERSIGHT- SO THAT WE KNOW HOW THIS- DATABASES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANYONE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHO WHO CAN COMMENT BUT- JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE AFTER WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF EFFORT LAST YEAR- REFORMING. DOGGER AND CONVERTING IT INTO CAL JAM AND- THE SORT OF JOINT EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING AROUND. DEALING WITH ARE IDLED- AN ORPHAN WELL PROGRAM AND OTHER SORT OF CRITICAL INSPECTIONS TO REBUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND- THE OIL SECTOR- HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DO MORE WITH WITH LESS. AND WHAT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE FALLING OUT FROM. FROM THIS SAT ABANDONED AUGMENTATION. FINANCER SORRY FROM CAL JAM ONE AT TAKE THAT.

HAD ON THIS ISSUE A LOT OF INDUSTRIES BUT THIS IS YEARS WELL AT SOME OF THE WORKLOAD THAT WAS ANTICIPATED IN CALCIUM PCP. NEEDS TO BE RE EVALUATED- AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME TO COME ALSO THAT TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE GOING FORWARD- THAT'S REALLY FRAMEWORK AND WITHDRAWAL. L. TALK A BIT MORE. CONSERVATION MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH WHAT THEY HAVE NOW TO CONTINUE THE GREAT WORK. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT- SENATOR DESERVE BETTER FROM THE PART OF CONSERVATION I CAN.

TO THE EXISTING REFORM EFFORTS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE- PRIOR TO THE- THESE AUGMENTATIONS. AND WE JUST THINK WITH THE- EXTREME ECONOMIC CHALLENGES- THEY'RE TAKING PLACE ACROSS MANY SECTORS OF THE STATE. INCLUDING THEIR OWN GAS INDUSTRY WOULD HAVEBEEN A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE TO ADD THESE. ADDITIONAL FEES TO THAT MIX OF CHALLENGES- SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON OUR I WILL PROGRAMS AND- RENEWING- WORKING ON IMPROVING INSPECTIONS AND TESTING.

PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION WAS ALSO INCLUDED SOME LIMITATION OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL LIABILITY SO THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SAVINGS IF WE IF WE- IMPLEMENTED AT THAT THAT WE WOULD BE LESS LIABLE FOR- YOU KOW.
