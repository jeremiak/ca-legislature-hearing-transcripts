THIS HEARING IS THE THIRD SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN'S WELL BEING WILL FOCUS ON THE PAST PRESENT FUTURE OF IMMIGRATION IN LOS ANGELES AND CALIFORNIANS INVESTMENT IT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. I'M PROUD TO BRING THIS HEARING TO OUR HOME DISTRICT OF LOS ANGELES AND AGAIN THANK CALMER FOR HOSTING. ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO CHET HE WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR C. YOUR HEALTH THIS YEAR HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT WAYS CALIFORNIA COULD IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN ALL CHILDREN. BY MAKING THEM HEALTHIER. BOTH OF US HAVE WORK TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY AND INCREASED HEALTH ACCESS THROUGHOUT OUR CAREERS. CHECK MY REALIZED THERE WAS NOTHING REALLY IN THE SENATE BY WAY OF A COMMITTEE OR SELECT COMMITTEE THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DELVE DEEPLY INTO THIS SUBJECT MATTER. WE WANTED TO FOCUS BROADLY ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN'S WELL BEING ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. BASED ON THAT I WALKED AWAY REALIZING THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY PERHAPS THEY HAVE A SELECT COMMITTEE A SELECT COMMITTEE IS DIFFERENT IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE STANDING COMMITTEE STANDING COMMITTEE HE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. MY COLLEAGUE HERE DOCTOR PAN SHARES THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE I CHEER THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND SOMETIMES I THINK WHAT WE FIND FRUSTRATING AS IN THOSE COMMITTEES WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY DOING I READ THE REVIEWING BILL THAT COME BEFORE US. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO GO DOT DELVED DEEPLY. INTO A SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER. ANSEL SELECT COMMITTEE ALLOWS US TO DO THAT WE DON'T HAVE BILL THAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY IT ALLOWS US TO TRAVEL TO GO TO PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TRAVEL SACRAMENTAL TO BRING UP THEIR PERSPECTIVE SO THAT'S THE POINT OF SELECT COMMITTEES AND WE USE OUR TIME DURING THE FALL. OUR LEGISLATIVE INTERIM TO REALLY KIND OF DO OUR OWN HOMEWORK AND THAT'S TYPICALLY WHEN WE HAVE THE SELECT COMMITTEES. WE HELD OUR FIRST HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND FOCUS ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. WE THEN WENT TO FRESNO DURING SUMMER BREAK. FRIENDS NO IN THE MONTH OF JULY YOU KNOW I'M A COMMITTED PUBLIC SERVANT I'M COMMITTED. AND FRESNO WAS SO HAPPY TO HAVE US THERE THERE WE FOCUS ON HEALTH CARE THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE REDLINING PESTICIDE AN AIR POLLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CHART TRIALS ABILITY BE WELL AND HEALTHY. AND AGAIN HERE FOR A THIRD HEARING THIS YEAR WE'RE FOCUSING ON IMMIGRATION IN LA BECAUSE WE AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'VE GOT ONE OF THE HIGHEST. POPULATIONS OF IMMIGRANT BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND WE LOVE THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN THIS NATION. PEOPLE OF VARYING LEGAL STATUS IS LIVE AMONG US AND SADLY MANY ARE LIVING IN FEAR THIS FEAR HAS TORN FAMILIES APART AND CREATE SERIOUS ISSUES. ISSUES AROUND FEAR. ISSUES AROUND TRAUMA ISSUES AROUND MIDDLE HEALTH. THE POLITICAL CLIMATE. PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE. IN CREATING THE SENSE OF FEAR. AND THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL THAT YOU'LL SEE BEFORE YOU- TALK ABOUT HOW OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FEEDING INTO THAT CLIMATE OF FEAR. BUT I'M ALSO CLEAR AS A STATE LEGISLATOR THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE ONLY ACCESS OF POP AXIS OF POWER WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO CULTIVATE INCLUSION. EQUALITY AND EQUITY IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WE CAN USE OUR TIME LEARNING AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE THROUGH HEARINGS LIKE THIS AND WE CAN COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KNOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. BEFORE I TURN IT OVER THE OTHER MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF. WHO HAVE BEEN HERE TO MAKE THIS EVENT POSSIBLE YOU COULD IMAGINE TO TAKE A OFFICIAL SENATE. COMMITTEE ON THE ROAD IS NOT EASY AND SO WE'RE ALSO BE LIVESTREAMED- CURRENTLY ON FACEBOOK ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE ON MY OWN SENATE WEBSITE. AND THAT CAN'T BE DONE BY ME IS MERELY SNAPPING MY FINGERS SO I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF. FROM OUR SERGEANTS REPROGRAPHICS THE SENATE LIBRARIANS MAIL ROOM THE LEGISLATIVE DATA CENTER MY DISTRICT STAFF- YOU ALL MAKE CIVIL SERVANTS SHINE AND WE APPRECIATE YOU. AGAIN OUR COLLABORATORS THE SEE YOUR HEALTH FOUNDATION WORK DILIGENTLY TO. PARTNER WITH US THE BANK THIS HEARING POSSIBLE. MY HOME GIRLS AT HOME GIRL INDUSTRIES FOR MAKING THE AMAZING PASTRIES.

I'D LIKE TO- INTRODUCE MY PARTNER IN HEALTH EQUITY. MY COLLEAGUE WHO REPRESENTS THE SIX SENATE DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO STATE SENATOR DR RICHARD PAN OKAY THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- SIR MITCHELL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND PROUD TO SERVE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE- UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP- I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IT'S GREAT TO BE IN YOUR HOOD YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN MIND. IN SACRAMENTO SO IT'S GREAT TO BE OUT HERE IN LOS ANGELES- IN YOUR YOUR HOME CHURCH AND C. C. EVERYONE HERE AND TO LEARN FROM ALL OF YOU HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA AND- HOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IS A PEDIATRICIAN CERTAINLY- I WAS VERY CERTAINLY VERY INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF. CHILDREN'S WELL BEING IN FACT A- AS PREVIOUSLY BEFORE OBSERVING THE LEGISLATURE- AT UC DAVIS WHERE I FOCUSED ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AND THE- AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- CENTER MITCHELL'S LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA AS- BUDGET- CHAIR AND PREVIOUSLY- I'M PROUD TO- TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH YOU AS YOUR SUCCESSOR ON BUDGETS OF THREE. SOMETIMES I EVEN SUCCEED I THINK OCCASION SO- BUT YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH THEY'RE TRYING TO BE SURE WE KEEP THE MOMENTUM THERE. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WE NEED TO DO AND- AS A MEMBER OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AS WELL THE VICE CHAIR- THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR THE API COMMUNES WELL AS MANY OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL. OVER HALF OF ALL A P. EYES ARE ACTUALLY IMMIGRANTS. RIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE API POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA OVER HALF OR ACTUALLY- IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES AND THEN YOU THINK THE REST YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER THAN CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS- EXACTLY THE FASTEST GROWING IMMIGRANT GROUPS- AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE OF COURSE A LONG HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION FROM MANY OTHER. BACKGROUNDS AS WELL. AND THE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND THAT PARTICULAR RELATION TO CHILDREN. I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE ATMOSPHERE THAT'S BEING GENERATED- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY THE CURRENT- PRESIDENT HIS ADMINISTRATION- AND- THAT IS NOT ONLY OF COURSE THROUGH THE POLICIES BUT EVEN BY GIVING- SENSUALLY- SUPPORT OR- ARE. ARE ARE- I WOULD SAY. BASICALLY CONDONING UNFORTUNATELY- ANTI IMMIGRANT RHETORIC BY OTHERS IT IS QUITE TROUBLING AND FACT AS WE ARE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO TRY TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTHIER AND STRONGER AND MORE WELCOMING AND ACTUALLY TO MOVE OUR ECONOMY FORWARD AS WELL. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS THE CONNIE THAT'S DRIVING THE ECONOMY FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE ACTUALLY BLOOMBERG NEWS SAID ONE OF ITS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY EMBRACE IMMIGRATION. RIGHT ACTUALLY BECAUSE POLICY GREAT EMBRACING IMMIGRANTS AS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE LEADING THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH OF THE UNITED STATES SO. IS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS CERTAINLY. WE ARE TRYING TO PUT IN POLICIES TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA THE GOLDEN STATE. BUT OUR CHALLENGES THAT WE ALSO ARE FACING POLICIES THEY'RE MAKING PEOPLE AFRAID AND FEARFUL OF ACTUALLY RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE SO NECESSARY TO HELP SUPPORT- FAMILIES AND TO ALLOW. IMMIGRANTS IN THE REST OF CALIFORNIA SUCCEED SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE TESTIMONY OUT FROM THE VARIOUS- WITNESSES ABOUT WHAT ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IS A STATE BUT THEN ALSO HOW CAN WE CHANGE THE CONVERSATION AROUND IMMIGRATION- NOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AGAIN I WANNA THANK. SIR MITCHELL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP CONVENING THIS HEARING AND I KNOW THE WORK OKAY CAN YOU DO IT AS A RESULT OF THIS HEARING AND ALSO TO THANK ALL THE- PEOPLE ARE DISSIPATING THE SPEAKERS AND THE STAFF.

TO COME IN I'D LIKE TO INVITE- DOCTOR VALLEJO WAS GOING TO DO OUR FIRST PRESENTATION TO JOIN A SOMEWHAT SHE COMES UP- IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE AUDIENCE. A SUGGESTION WAS MADE THAT WE- HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF CONGRESSMAN. CUMMINGS AND- I- FRANKLY I'M GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENT SUGGESTION. I THINK MOMENTS OF SILENCE OUR WHILE RESPECTFUL ARE PASSIVE. AND THERE WAS NOTHING PASSIVE ABOUT THE ADVOCACY OF CONGRESSMAN COMING. SO WHEN I'M GOING TO SUGGEST YOU ALL DO. IS AT THE END OF TODAY'S HEARING AFTER WE'VE HEARD PRESENTATIONS BY ALL THESE EXPERTS WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MOMENT WE GO MAKE SOME NOISE. THE POINT OF MAKING THE NOISE WILL BE YOU ALSO MAKING A DECISION BASED ON THE WORK YOU DO EVERY DAY OR PERHAPS. A NEW RELATIONSHIP YOU FORMED BY MEETING SOMEONE THIS MORNING OR SOMETHING YOU HEARD BY OUR EXPERT PANELS ABOUT AN ACTION YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE. SO CONGRESSMAN CUMMINGS LIFE AND WORK WILL NOT BE IN VAIN WHAT ACTION ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER BEFORE US TODAY. AND SO AT THE END OF THE HEARING WHEN WE MAKE OUR NOISE WE WILL BE PUTTING INTO THE UNIVERSE OUR COMMITMENT TO BE ACTION ORIENTED. NOT MERELY PAUSING FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE TO MAKE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO AFTER THIS. BEAN ACTIVIST CHANGE AGENTS FAIR ENOUGH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT DOCTOR BLAKE- IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AMERICANA STUDIES AND ETHNICITY AND THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TODAY SHE'S GONNA KICK US OFF BY EDUCATING US ON THE HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION IN L. A. IN CAL AND CALIFORNIA AND TOUCH ON RECENT IMMIGRATION ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY DOCTOR VALLEJO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY FOR- CONVENING THIS GROUP FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SENATOR MITCHELL IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE. TO BE HERE. SO LOS ANGELES HAS LONG BEEN HAILED AS THIS GLAMOROUS MULTI ETHNIC CITY OF POSSIBILITY AND UPWARD MOBILITY A PLACE WHERE AMERICAN DREAMS ARE SUPPOSEDLY MADE. BUT AMIDST THE GLITZ AND THE GLAMOUR INEQUALITY IN LA IS PALPABLE AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND THESE CONTRADICTORY TRENDS IN PROSPERITY ON THE ONE HAND BUT ALSO POVERTY ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE OCCURRED AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SIGNIFICANT RACIAL ETHNIC CHANGE. KEEP CAN YOU CHANGE THE SITE FOR ME PLEASE. SO IN ORDER TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE LA A TODAY AND HOW TO CONTINUE BUILDING AN EQUITABLE MULTI ETHNIC REGION THAT WILL LEAD THE NATION ON IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF OUR GOALS AT THE STATE AT THE REGION WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STATE AND OUR REGION WAS BUILT ON A SYSTEM OF SETTLER COLONIALISM WHERE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE REMOVED AND DISPLACED FROM THEIR LANDS WE HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE HISTORY IN LA A PERPETUAL ANGEL VIOLENCE AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT. BUT ALSO AIM TO MAINTAIN WHITE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DOMINANCE SO WHAT WE NOW CALL LA IS TOM VIA LAND AND THE TOM THE COMMUNITY EXTENDS FROM THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS THE SANTA ANA RIVER IN OVER THE ENTIRE ELLIE BILLS BASIM NORTH LA IS TO TAPE HIM LAND IN BOTH THESE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO LIVE IN LA DESPITE- THE FACT. THAT. C. AND SOCIAL- THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. EFFORTS TO RAISE THESE COMMUNITIES BUT THERE'S ALSO MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN LA WHOSE HISTORIES ARE EMBEDDED INTO THE FABRIC OF OUR CITY SO THESE INCLUDE NATIVE PEOPLES FROM. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS PACIFIC ISLANDER AND LATIN AMERICAN INDIGENOUS DIASPORAS SO ALLEY ISN'T JUST AN IMMIGRANT CITY IT ISN'T JUST AN AFRICAN AMERICAN CITY IT'S ALSO AN INDIGENOUS CITY. LOS ANGELES HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF ANY CITY IN THE US NOW ELLIE IS ALSO ROOTED. IN SPANISH AND THEN ENGLISH SETTLER COLONIALISM SO AFTER PLUNDERING AZTEC EMPIRE A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED BY SPAIN TO COLONIZE. CALIFORNIA VIA THE MISSION SYSTEM. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE A GROUP OF FORTY ONE PEOPLE KNOWN AS LOS POBLADO IT IS OCCUPIED AN AREA. IN NORTH- IT NEAR THE ALLEY RIVER. THE PUEBLO WAS NAMED AFTER THE PERSONALLY CAME TO BE CALLED LOS ANGELES WHAT WE KNOW OUR CITY YESTERDAY. SORRY A CITY THERE THERE WAS A THRIVING NATIVE AMERICAN AT CITY. OF THE SETTLER COLONISTS BECAME KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA'S THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE HERE IN LA BECAME KNOWN AS THE GABRIELINO AFTER THE SAN GABRIEL MISSION. AFTER MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE WAS ACHIEVED FROM SPAIN IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE THE MISSIONS LOST THEIR GRIP ON CONTROL AND THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CREATED HUGE RANCHES IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAND WAS GIVEN TO THE ELITE PEOPLE BORN IN CALIFORNIA MIXED BLOOD BUT WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AT THE TOP OF THE RACIAL HIERARCHY. DO ANY OF THESE NAMES SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU LOS FELIS YEAH. THE PAN THE MALIBU. I'M I COULD I COULD GO ON AND ON SAN PEDRO. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT MEXICO CEDED CALIFORNIA TO THE U. S. WITH THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO END THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR- TEAMS LIKE ME KEEP PLEASE. THERE CAN WAR DIDN'T END WITH THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY I ALLEN- WITH A MASSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AS ANGLOS CAME INTO THE STATE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS AND IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO. AN ALLEY GREW AND PROSPERED BECAUSE THE ANGLO WOULD LEAD AT THE TIME IT DIVESTED CALIFORNIA THE MEXICAN AMERICANS OF THEIR LAND AND POLITICAL POWER. AND USE LAWS SOCIAL PRACTICES AND RACIAL VIOLENCE TO EXCLUDE AND CATEGORIZE NON WHITE PEOPLE AS OTHERS. NOW POPULATION CONTINUED TO GROW AFTER THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS PART OF THE GROWTH WAS DUE IN PART TO IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION. BUT IT WAS ALSO DUE TO A GREAT INTERNAL MIGRATION WHITE ETHNICS COMING FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS BLACK AMERICANS COMING FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE US SO PEOPLE WERE PULLED INTO. LA ONCE AGAIN LIKE WE SEE TODAY BY THE PROMISE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM EXPANDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES- ESPECIALLY MANUFACTURING GERALD DURING AFTER I WORLD WAR TWO ABUNDANT SPACE THERE WAS ONCE ABUNDANT SPACE IN LOS ANGELES. AND THE PROMISE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. BY THE MID. TWENTIETH CENTURY ONLY WAS MAJORITY WHITE BUT WAS ALSO A SPRAWLING METROPOLIS COMPRISED OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AFRICAN AMERICANS LONG SETTLED MEXICAN ASIAN AMERICAN PEOPLE JEWISH AMERICANS AND SOMEONE. OF COURSE ALL OF THESE GROUPS WERE LIVING UNDER A SYSTEM OF WHITE SUPREMACY THAT WAS ENFORCED BY SOCIAL PRACTICES A WEB OF LIES AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD CITY STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS THAT RESULTED IN RICK RACIAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THE IMPACT OF RED LINING WHICH CANNOT BE OVERSTATED IN THE CASE OF LOS ANGELES. AND THIS OF COURSE RESULTED IN TWO MAJOR WAVES OF CIVIL UNREST AN UPRISING IN THE SIXTIES AND THE NINETEEN NINETIES OF COURSE DESPITE THESE BARRIERS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN LA CONTINUE TO THRIVE. BUT THIS IS STORICA CONTEXT COMBINED WITH THIS CONTEMPORARY MOMENT. THE POLITICS OF FEAR AND A BOLD ATTACK ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. SHAPES THE INTEGRATION OF NEWER IMMIGRANTS TO LA THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY. AND THIS BRINGS ME TO ONE OF THE CENTRAL CONCERNS WHEN THINKING ABOUT. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY TODAY IS WHAT IS IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION WE SAY THAT IT IS AN INTENTIONAL PROCESS THAT INCLUDES THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES IT'S A GOVERNMENT POLICIES AT THE CITY REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL. I THINK I HAVE TWENTY MINUTES. IS THAT MY TWENTY MINUTES UP. OKAY I'M WE C. IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION IS A DYNAMIC RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH NEW COMERS AND THE RECEIVING SOCIETY BOTH HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTEGRATION AND BOTH BENEFIT AS THEY WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD SAFE DRIVING AND CONNECTED COMMUNITIES SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION PEOPLE THINK THE INTEGRATION IS SOLELY BASED ON WHAT IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES ARE DOING BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY HOW INTO IMMIGRANTS FULLY INTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY IT IS A RECIPROCAL. TWO WAY PROCESS INTEGRATION ALSO DEPENDS ON WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE DOING ON THE GROUND THE POLICIES THAT YOU ARE ALL MAKING AND WE CAN THINK OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION AND A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS ECONOMIC MOBILITY THE ABILITY TO FULLY ENGAGE IN THE ECONOMY WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT. ALL OF YOU AND SENATOR PAN CENTER JOEL MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS WORTH WARMTH OF WELCOME THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOMED BY THE RECEDING SOCIETY AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THE ABILITY FOR IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS TO FULLY ENGAGE ARTISTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. NOW AS SENATOR MITCHELL ALREADY MET AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CREATE AND DELETE FEDERAL POLICY IMMIGRATION POLICY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL PRIMARILY WHO IS ALLOWED TO BECOME. IMMIGRATE THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME A CITIZEN. AND THESE POLICIES AND RHETORIC HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY PUNITIVE AND RACIALIZED IN THE TRUMP IN ERA. AND SO THAT IS WHY IT IS LEFT UP TO STATES CITIES AND REGIONS TO CRAFT POLICIES THAT INSURE IMMIGRANTS THEIR CHILDREN. AND LONG SETTLED AMERICANS CAN THRIVE SOCIALLY CIVIC LEÓN ECONOMICALLY. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US AT TODAY CAN YOU CHANGE ASIDE FOR ME PLEASE. SO UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK IN THE LAST FEW YEARS YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE- DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COUNTRY ARE TRANSFORMING IN TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY SO BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THE US IS POISED TO BE A MAJORITY MINORITY COUNTRY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. 80% OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES IDENTIFIED AS WHITE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND BETWEEN TWENTY FORTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE THE UNITED STATES WILL CEASE TO BE MAJORITY WHITE NOW GUEST WHAT STATE AND REGION OF RT EXPERIENCE THESE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES. THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW SO YOU CAN SEE THAT CALIFORNIA WAS 67% WHITE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY M. BY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA WAS NO LONGER A MAJORITY WHITE STATE. BY TWENTY FIFTY. 24% OF CALIFORNIANS WILL BE WHITE. LA WAS ALREADY MAJORITY MINORITY BEFORE THE STATE LA IS REALLY REALLY SERVES. CHANGING IN THIS REGARD SO IN 198053% OF I MEAN HE CAN CHANGE HIS LIFE FOR ME PLEASE. HE. 53% OF OUR. PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY WERE WHITE AND CALIFORNIA WAS 41% WHITE BY NINETEEN NINETY. I'M SORRY AT A LOS ANGELES AND BY TWENTY FIFTY ONLY 19% OF PEOPLE IN LA WELL IDENTIFIED. AS WHITE. SO IMMIGRANTS ARE A VITAL AND LARGE PART OF LA COUNTY. I'M KEITH CAN CAN YOU CHANGE ASIDE FOR ME AGAIN PLEASE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AT THE PERCENT IMMIGRANT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BY NINETEEN SEVENTY TWENTY SIXTEEN. A LITTLE OVER A THIRD OF ALLEYS COUNTY'S POPULATION ARE FOREIGN BORN. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ABOUT 13% OF LOS ANGELES WAS FOREIGN BORN BUT TODAY IT'S THE THIRD. OF OUR COUNTY. AND. IMMIGRANTS TODAY HAVE A VARIETY OF STATUSES AS SENATOR MITCHELL- MENTIONED SO KEEP THE CHANGE THE SLIDE PLEASE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS BY IMMIGRATION STATUS FIVE. 9% OF IMMIGRANTS IN LA COUNTY ARE DOCUMENTED 10% A LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS AND 17% ARE NATURALIZED CITIZENS. ONE MORE TIME FOR ME PLEASE KEEP. 80% OF IMMIGRANTS IN LOS ANGELES HOW BEN IN THE COUNTRY TEN YEARS OR LONGER SO IMMIGRANTS IN LA ARE A LONG SETTLED POPULATION. 86% OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ONE IN FIVE ANGELENOS ARE UNDOCUMENTED THEMSELVES OR LIVE WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS A DOCUMENTED AND 68% OF UNDOCUMENTED ANGELENOS HAVE BEEN IN THE US MORE. THAN A DECADE SO THIS MEANS THAT POLICY IS THAT FAMILIES APART HAVE BROAD IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITIES THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY IS CONNECTED TO FAMILIES CHILDREN- WORKPLACES SCHOOLS ALL OF THE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH- THAT BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY TO FUNCTION. I WANT TO SHOW YOU A SLIDE THAT SHOWS SOME OF THE TOP BIRTH COUNTRIES FOR MORE IMMIGRANTS TODAY ARE HANDLING KEEP TEAM DECIDE FOR ME PLEASE. IMMIGRANT ANGELENOS ARE LATINO NEARLY ONE THIRD OR ASIAN AMERICAN OR PACIFIC PACIFIC ISLANDER THERE'S ALSO A GROWING BLACK IMMIGRANT POPULATION. BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE TOP BIRTH COUNTRIES THEY'VE CHANGED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO THIRTY YEARS AGO 42% CAME FROM MEXICO A PERCENT FROM EL SALVADOR. AND 6% FROM THE PHILIPPINES BUT OF THE IMMIGRANTS WHO MIGRATED LESS THAN TEN YEARS AGO TODAY ONLY A QUARTER COME FROM MEXICO. 11% COME FROM CHINA AND 8% COME FROM THE PHILIPPINES AND WE'VE SEEN MORE- AN INCREASE IN IMMIGRANTS FROM ASIA AND ALSO FROM CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES. NOW THERE'S TWO ELEMENTS OF INTEGRATION THAT I WANT TO TOUCH ON- QUICKLY ONE IS CIVIC ENGAGEMENT KEEP CAN YOU CHANGE THE SITE FOR ME PLEASE. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IMMIGRANTS BECOMING ENGAGED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ONE IMPORTANT WAY TO FACILITATE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. IS VIA EFFORTS AROUND NATURALIZATION SO THE BENEFITS OF NATURALIZATION INCLUDE THINGS LIKE INCREASED WAGES BETTER ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN PROTECTIONS FROM PUNITIVE ENFORCEMENT POLICIES. AND THINGS LIKE BOATING WHICH MEANS THAT IMMIGRANTS HAVE A GREATER VOICE IN POLICY MAKING THERE'S ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO BECOME. CITIZENS. AND ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OF LET THE ORIGINS OF 70% ARE LATINO TWENTY PERCENT. ARE API SO STRONG EFFORTS AROUND NATURALIZATION REVERBERATE AT MULTIPLE LEVELS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT SENATORS YOU DON'T HAVE THE SLIDE BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A COPY OF IT. I'M CHANGE THE SIDE FOR ME PLEASE KEITH IMMIGRANTS INTACT AND AN LA TEND TO BE BETWEEN THE WORKING AGES AND THEY'RE ALSO LARGE CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR- INDUSTRIES AND OUR ECONOMY. AS YOU SEE IN THIS SLIDE THE RED. REPRESENTS NATIVE BORN AMERICANS WHO ARE IN THE SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES BY SECTOR AND THE GREEN BLUE AND ORANGE REPRESENT IMMIGRANTS SO. IMMIGRANTS ARE SPREAD ALL ACROSS THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF LOS ANGELES AND COMMITTED IMMIGRANT EMPLOYED IN NEARLY EVERY. ECONOMIC SECTOR BUT. JEAN SLIDE KEITH IMMIGRANTS ARE OFTEN PAID LESS THAN THE U. S. BORN AND INCOMES VARIED DEPENDING ON RECENCY OF ARRIVAL AND ALSO IMMIGRATION STATUS THE MORE RECENTLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANTS MAKE LOWER INCOMES. AS DO UNDOCUMENTED AND THOSE WHO ARE LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS NATURALIZED IMMIGRANTS MAKE- HAVE THE HIGHEST HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN LA COUNTY. IMMIGRANTS ALSO I EDUCATION OF COURSE ALSO VARIES BY STATUS KEITH TEAMS ASIDE FOR ME PLEASE. I'M THE FOREIGN BORN HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN THE U. S. BORE THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION HAS THE LOWEST LEVELS BUT OF COURSE THESE DISPARITIES ARE RELATED TO VARIOUS BARRIERS THAT MAKE EDUCATION UNATTAINABLE. AND THEN BEING LA WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING BURDEN AND- HOMEOWNER RENTER BURDEN KEITH CHANGE THE SLIDE FOR ME PLEASE. IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF RENT AND HOMEOWNER BIRDING AND THIS REDUCES OF COURSE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR OTHER SERVICES AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT PARENTS HAVE TO INVEST IN THEIR CHILDREN. AND ACCUMULATING ASSETS FOR EMERGENCIES SO IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND RACIAL ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN. OUTCOMES BUT ALSO AS SENATOR MITCHELL MENTIONED EARLIER VARIATIONS IN IMMIGRATION STATUS AND WHO IS PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED HE WAS AT ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZED. AND SO FORTH SO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES OF ROT BUT I ALSO MADE A HANDY LIST HERE CHANGE THE SIDE FOR ME PLEASE KEITH. I'M HERE ARE TEN THINGS THAT SCHOLARS ACTIVIST COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IMMIGRANT SERVING ORGANIZATIONS ARE REALLY REALLY WORRIED ABOUT AT THE FEDERAL POLICY LEVEL. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT NEW ATTACKS ON LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR NATURALIZATION THIS INCLUDES THINGS LIKE CHANGES THE PUBLIC CHARGE WHICH ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE DISCUSSING LATER. THIS OF COURSE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ELIGIBLE NATURALIZER IMMIGRANTS TO OBTAIN LEGAL RESIDENCY IF THEY USE SOME BENEFITS. THERE'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT IMMIGRATION VIA LEGAL MEANS BY REDUCING THE ASYLUM LEASE A CEILING INCREASING FEES MAKING VISA APPLICANTS SHOW THAT THEY CAN AFFORD HEALTHCARE THIS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT. IMMIGRANTS OF COLOR API'S AND LATINO IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE- APPLYING FOR FAMILY REUNIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE POLICIES AROUND DETENTION AND DEPORTATION. CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY IS ALSO A PARTICULAR CONCERN WE NEED EVERYBODY TO BE COUNTED SO THAT DATA CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES. AND I THINK MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES TODAY BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY TO AT DISCUSS THEM. SO KEEP CAN YOU CHANGE THE SLIDE FOR ME PLEASE I'M JUST GOING TO WRAP UP HERE. MUCH OF THE DATA THAT I PRESENTED HERE TODAY SENATORS IS INCLUDED IN A FORTHCOMING REPORT THE STATE OF IMMIGRANTS IN LOS QUE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY- FROM THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION THAT REPORT WILL BE RELEASED IN DECEMBER. THAT REPORT TAKES A DEEPER DIVE INTO ELLIE'S IMMIGRANT POPULATION AND PROVIDES MORE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BECOMING A LEADER ON AND ON IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION ALSO ESTABLISHES A BASELINE ON IMMIGRANTS AND ALLIES THAT WE CAN MEASURE MOBILITY. GOING FORWARD. THE POINT IS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE HERE IN LA AS WE ALL KNOW THEY MIGRATE FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OR TO SKATE POLITICAL TURMOIL TO REUNITE WITH FAMILIES. AND EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION POLICIES. MAY NEED TO VARY BY CITY OR COMMUNITY. POLICY ARE. MAYBE TO VERY DEPENDING ON IMMIGRATION STATUS. STRATEGIES FOR CREATING WELCOME AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED AND SHOULD ALSO BE INFORMED BY IMMIGRANTS SERVING ORGANIZATIONS SO A STRONG COMMITMENT TO EMIGRATE INTEGRATION LIKE WE'VE SEEN- ALL OF YOU DISCUSS TODAY WILL BENEFIT IMMIGRANTS FAMILIES BUT ALSO LONG SETTLED ANGELENOS IN CALIFORNIANS ALIGHT ALIKE ENDS WHAT WE DO HERE IN LA IN CALIFORNIA REALLY LIGHTS THE WAY FOR OTHER REGIONS COMMITTED TO INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACTIVELY HELP. NO THERE ALLEN. I SEE THE WHEELS TURNING YOUR HEAD. I KNOW YOU. CAN YOU I'M- GIVE US A SENSE OF. I HAVE HOW. SHIFTING VISA POLICIES ARE CHANGING THE DENT CHANGING OUR DEMOGRAPHICS HERE- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE WHERE YOU CAN YOU ALSO GONNA COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE CONVERSATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND IN CHANGING THE WAY WE DO WE GRANT RB IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND HOW YOU THINK IT MIGHT IMPACT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HERE. YES THE NUMBER OF. A PROPOSED RULE CHANGES THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SUGGESTING- AND HAVE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT- IN AN EFFORT TO RESTRICT IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF THE MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS TO ENTER INTO THE UNITED STATES ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY HELP FROM ASIA LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN MANY OF US OF COURSE SEE THIS IS A VERY IS VERY RACIALIZED POLICIES TO. TRY TO PREVENT. THE. CHANGING NATURE OF- THE UNITED STATES IS DEMOGRAPHIC BUT THERE ARE- POLICIES THAT ARE TRYING TO M. IMPLEMENTS HIGHER FEES ON VISAS FOR EXAMPLE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM APPLYING FOR VISAS INTO THE U. S. THERE ARE NEW POLICIES THAT ARE BEING SUGGESTED TO- REQUIRE IMMIGRANTS TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN PAY FOR OR AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH WILL PREVENT PARTICULAR IMMIGRANTS FROM APPLYING- FOR VISAS INTO THE UNITE TO COME INTO THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OF COURSE THE API COMMUNITY AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHO OVERWHELMINGLY APPLY FOR FAMILY REUNIFICATION IN THE U. S. THERE ARE. ALSO ATTEMPTS TO OR THERE AN AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE. THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DECREASING AND THE REFUGEE CEILING SO THE RARE REFUGEE CEILING IS ONCE AGAIN DECREASING BY HALF WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DECREASING THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES AND ASYLUM IS THAT THEY WILL ALLOW INTO THE UNITED STATES. THE CAP IS THAT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR NEXT YEAR YEAH I WAS REGULARLY- THE LATTER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND AND SO THIS IS ARE YOU SAID. EIGHTY THOUSAND UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND IT HAS BEEN REDUCED TO EIGHTEEN AS THE ALLEN EIGHT YEAH Q. AND SO THIS IS. AGAIN ATTEMPTS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ENTERING IN TWO AT THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR MANY OF US TO KEEP UP I HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THE CHANGES ARE CONSTANT THE CHANGES ARE INCREASINGLY- PUNITIVE EXACTLY. EVEN IT IS IT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO AT MY GREAT THE US BUT THOSE WERE ALREADY HERE AGAIN PUBLIC CHARGES ON MY **** COLLEAGUES DISCUSS LATER ON IS AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE WHO CAN POTENTIALLY BECOME US CITIZENS- SO THOSE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THESE NEW ATTACKS ON. THE ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE IN WHO ARE ALREADY HERE IN THE US. WELL THE QUESTION ABOVE JUST LOOKING AT THIS CHART THE YOU HAD I I'VE SO IF WE WERE ACTUALLY CHATTING ABOUT THE HOW FAST HE WAS LOOKING AT THOSE FOLKS WHO MIGRATED HERE MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO VERSUS THOSE. WHO COME IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE TWO OF THEM ONE OF THEM. IS THAT YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS FROM MAX. DOES DROP FROM THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE FACT THAT THE- THE- NUMBER OF FOLKS FROM CHINA JUMP FROM 3% TO ELEVEN. CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE- GEOPOLITICS BEHIND THOSE TWO. THOSE TWO CHEFS. YEAH THAT'S- A GREAT QUESTION. SO THE SO THE TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA NEAR TRENDS. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES MORE GENERALLY RATES OF MEXICAN MIGRATION TO THE US ARE ACTUALLY WHAT SCHOLARS SAY IT WE CALL WE SAY THAT NET ZERO BECAUSE THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE MEXICANS LEAVING THE US THAT ARE ARRIVING. AND THE MEXICAN IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES IS LONG SETTLED- ON AVERAGE. OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE US HAVE BEEN HERE TEN YEARS OR LONGER AND THESE SHIFTS ACTUALLY. THE MAC THE DECLINE IN MEXICAN IMMIGRATION THE BEST ACTUALLY STARTED RIGHT BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION SO THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES SO DESPITE WHAT YOU HEAR DONALD TRUMP'S THOUSAND ABOUT MEXICAN IMMIGRATION. MEXICAN IMMIGRATION IS AT HISTORIC LOWS TO THE UNITED STATES SOME OF THIS- DYNAMICS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE U. S. THE LABOR MARKET FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO WOULD PICK BACK UP AFTER THE RECESSION. ENDED BUT THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE THERE'S MULTIPLE DYNAMICS WITH IN MEXICO ITSELF THE SOME OF THE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT IMMIGRATION IS THAT. IT'S NOT JUST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES BUT ALSO BY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. AND IT'S REALLY AFFECTED BY THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. SO DYNAMICS IN MEXICO SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE BIRTH RATE THE BIRTH RATE IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW IS. A REPLACEMENT LEVEL TWO CHILDREN PER FAMILY. I'M WHICH REDUCES THE QUARTER THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION. WHO IS FACING A G. CATION PERTINENTES. S. R. IN MEXICO ITSELF. SO MOST OF THE. LATINO MIGRATION IS COMING FROM- CENTRAL AMERICA CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES WHO ARE. AND MIGRATING BECAUSE OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL ROT BY US. INTERVENTION IN THOSE COUNTRIES A LONG HISTORY OF US INTERVENTION WE HAVE SOME POSTS ON OUR BLOG IT'S YES I I'D THAT DISCUSS THIS MORE FULLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN READING MORE ABOUT THOSE. MOST OF THE GROWTH IN THE LATINO POPULATION IN THE US IS COMING FROM A GROWTH IN THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS NOT FROM IMMIGRATION WHEREAS MOST OF THE GROWTH IN THE ASIAN POPULATION IS COMING FROM. IMMIGRATION. SPECIFICALLY TALK THE DYNAMICS OF SUCH AN INCREASE THE FOLKS FROM CHINA- IS THAT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT AS A CHINESE GOVERNMENT LOOSEN RESTRICTIONS ON LEAVING THE COUNTRY. SOME OF THE INCREASE IN IMMIGRATION FROM CHINA IS THE WAY THAT WE SELECT IMMIGRANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WAY THAT OUR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY SELECTS IMMIGRANTS. WERE THE PRIMARY WAY TO M. MIGRATE TO THE UNITED STATES LAWFULLY IS VIA- EMPLOYMENT OR FAMILY REUNIFICATION. AND OUR EMPLOYMENT POLICIES- FOR MIGRATION TYPICALLY. PRIVILEGE OF THOSE WHO ARE- WHO HAVE WHAT. DEFINE AS HIGH SKILLS AND SO THAT'S THE LAX IMMIGRANTS FROM PARTICULAR COUNTRIES SUCH AS HIGH SKILLED INDIAN IMMIGRANTS OR INDIANS FROM I'M SORRY IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA SOME OF IT HAS TO DO WITH OF COURSE CHANGING DYNAMICS IN CHINA BUT SOME OF IT ALSO HAS TO DO. WITH FAMILY REUNIFICATION AS WELL SO AS MIGRATION FROM CHINA I INCREASE AFTER IMMIGRATION LAWS CHANGED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THIS IS WHEN WE SAW THE STATE THIS LARGE INCREASE IN IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW CHANGED. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE- MUCH OF THAT INCREASE IS DUE TO FAMILY REUNIFICATION POLICIES AND ALSO EMPLOYMENT POLICIES. BUT I WILL SAY I'M SORRY WHAT MANY PEOPLE ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE FASTEST GROWING UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY OUR ASIAN ORIGIN AS WELL SO SOME OF- THIS IS ALSO AGAIN A STEREO TYPE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHO IS A DOCUMENTED IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY AND- COMMUNITIES. ASH INTERESTING NEPHEW MADE ONE OF THE POINTS I WAS GONNA ASK ABOUT THAT- AND I ALSO MAKE NOTES IT JUST AN OBSERVATION THAT- EVEN AS- THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS DROPPED OUR- REFUGEE ACCEPTANCE TO RECORD LOWS WE ALSO PURSUING POLICIES TO GENERATE MORE REFUGEES AROUND THE WORLD. MOST RECENTLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST SO WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT THAT. AREA THE SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD AND. AND I GUESS THE ONE SLIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN FRONT OF US BUT YOU ABOUT- WHERE PEOPLE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES A FOURTH SO- I GUESS AN OBSERVATION WOULD BE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STATE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WOULD ACTUALLY BE DROPPING. RIGHT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION THAT WE ARE. CONTINUING OUR GROWTH AND IN FACT I KNOW THIS IS A WORKFORCE COMMISSION BUT YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT JOSH UP FUTURE SHORTAGES. AND OUR WORK FORCE AND VARIETY DIFFERENT SECTORS. I CAN YOU SPEAK TO- THE ROLE OF IMMIGRATION IN TERMS OF SUSTAINING OUR ECONOMY- IN TERMS OF WHERE. AND WE OFTEN DO TALK ABOUT MANY IMMIGRANTS. DO END UP THEY'LL START OFF AND LOW WAGE AND- SERVICE SECTOR POSITIONS BUT ACTUALLY IF WHAT HAPPENS BOTH THEIR OWN PROGRESSION AND UNDER FAMILY AS WELL. AND IT IS IT'S BASICALLY PART OF THE ENGINE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE AT LEAST ACTUALLY SAID NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WE ACTUALLY OF. THE FEDERAL MINISTRATION SORT OF GOT THE LEAST PHILOSOPHICALLY THEIR WAY- WHAT. IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON- THE CONNIE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY. YES IMMIGRANTS AT SUCH A GREAT POINT THAT YOU- BRING UP SENATE EARTH THANK YOU IMMIGRANTS. THE RESEARCH SHOWS CONSISTENTLY THAT IMMIGRANTS REVITALIZE ECONOMIES IMMIGRANTS- CONTRIBUTE TO THE INNOVATION IN COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANTS START BUSINESSES AT HIGHER RATES NATIVE BORN- SO IMMIGRANTS. FUNDAMENTALLY ARE AN ADDED BENEFIT TO ECONOMIES AND ESPECIALLY TO CALIFORNIA AND ALLEYS ECONOMY- DECIDED YOU DIDN'T HAVE WHICH- PROVIDE TO YOU SHOWS THAT OVER HALF OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN CONSTRUCTION MANUFACTURING AND TRADE SERVICES- WHOLESALE TRADE ARE IMMIGRANTS. THESE ARE SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SECTORS THAT UP HOLD OUR STATE AND THAT ARE SEEING- GROWTH AS WELL AND SO IMMIGRANTS ARE FOR PHIL AS AN ESSENTIAL NEED. THAT OUR STATE HAS WHAT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT IS ARE THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS SO THE CHILL. ARE THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IS WHY INVEST IN THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS REALLY IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. IF YOU WANT TO INVEST IN THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS IF YOU INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA YOU INVEST IN PARENTS. YOU PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY. AND STICK BETTER BOB YOU PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS TO NATURAL. ALL THE. BENEFITS STREAM DOWN ITS TREND MY. ECONOMIC INTEGRATION IT HAS IMPACTS ON THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS WHO THERE FOR- ATTAIN IT BETTER PAYING JOBS HIGHER STATUS JOBS AND SO FORTH SO IMMIGRANTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMY OF COURSE IMMIGRANTS IN THEIR CHILDREN ARE MUCH MORE THAN THEIR ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTIONS. RIGHT THEY'RE ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CIVIC VITALITY OF OUR STATE AND. MORE NO I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER I KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY OFTENTIMES RHETORIC AGAINST IMMIGRATION IS BASED ON A FIXED PIE- WELL THEY'RE COMPETING TO TAKING JOBS AWAY FROM US WHAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS HOW IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE PIE. THAT'S RIGHT SO THE AXIS ACKLEY RIGHT AND SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. BEFORE LEYVA LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEST FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ALL CATHLEEN WHETHER IMMIGRANT OR NATIVE BORN WHERE ELSE THEN WE NEED TO THOSE ARE THE POLICIES WE NEED TO PURSUE AND I THINK THAT'S I APPRECIATE AGAIN THIS IS. THANK YOU. THIS IS ALSO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS FOR CHILDREN THAT- AGAIN YEAH AND IT IS ABOUT POLICIES THAT. IMPROVE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHICH IS. INCLUDES THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE HAVE OUR CHILDREN GROW UP AND AS WELL AS THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU SO MUCH. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION YOU MADE A COMMENT TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION. SUGGESTING THAT- MUNICIPALITIES EVEN COULD HAVE DIFFERING POLICIES. AND A STATE POLICY MAKERS I THINK WE TEND TO FOCUS ON. BEAT WRITER WRONG OR INDIFFERENT. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL APPROPRIATELY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO BECAUSE I WAS INTRIGUED BY YOUR COMMENT TO GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE- OF. YOU KNOW POLICY THAT THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- TO VERY BASED ON MUNICIPALITY. WELL SENATOR MITCHELL YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT I'M SORRY. I WAS STRUCK AS I THOUGHT. VERTICALLY IN IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS FOR THE CHILD'S WELL BEING I JUST YEAH SO I ASSUMED I WAS MISSING SOMETHING YEAH SO POLICIES ARE EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE AROUND NATURALIZATION COULD VERY RIGHT MUNICIPALITIES AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE STATE AT THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF AN IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION WE KNOW WHERE THE ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE POPULATION ACTUALLY RESIDES. AND WE HAVE THAT DATA EVEN BY CAN TO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT- SO POLICY IS MY VERY I HAVE MORE RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE PUT INTO NATURALIZATION EFFORTS AT A CITY LEVEL GOT IT FIRST IS- ANOTHER CITY WHICH MIGHT BE MORE- FOCUSED ON- MIKE MIGHT CREATE POLICIES. AROUND. ECONOMIC INTEGRATION I GOT IT SO IT IS BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY GOT YOU. OKAY THANK YOU YOUR AVAILABLE ACCOUNT THE THING UP BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING US KIND OF OUR BASE LINE SO WE ARE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE CITY THAT WE LIVE IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTIVATE SO MUCH. FOR COMING. I'M GONNA ASK THE SECOND PANEL TO COME ON AND TAKE YOUR SEATS AND WHILE I DO THAT WE'VE BEEN JOINED WITH THIS IS A VERY. POPULAR SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING- TODAY GERMAN.

AND ROBERT PULLIN MILES THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG YOUR AGENDA YOU KNOW THAT PANEL TO WILL FOCUS ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT IN M. AGAIN CHILDREN. WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY MARCELA RELEASE WHO WILL BE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION SERVICES- SHE IS HERE REPRESENTING SHE IS THE BRANCH CHIEF OF THE IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES PROGRAM BRANCH WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. NAME MAILLOT. IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MISS SMALLS PRESENTATION WILL FOCUS ON WHAT WE DID AT THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR WHICH IS EXPANDING ACCESS- TO CHILDREN UNDER NINETEEN- REGARDLESS OF STATUS ON WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR'S RESPECT AS WHICH WAS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MEDICARE AL FOR NOW YOUNG ADULTS AGAIN REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS SO WE'RE GONNA HERE TODAY HOW THAT EXPANSION WENT- FOR THE UP TO NINETEEN YEAR OLDS AND THEIR PLANS ON A- GO FORWARD BASIS. AND FINALLY WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY DAVID O'BRIEN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WHO PROVIDE THE LATEST INFORMATION ON FINANCIAL AID TO HELP STUDENTS KNOW WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM TO ALLOW THEM TO OBTAIN A HIGHER EDUCATION DEGREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US YOU CAN DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST WE'RE WE'RE OPEN. EXCELLENT THANK YOU MISTER LEWIS THIS RELEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR PAN SENATOR ALLEN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR HOSTING THIS CONVERSATION AND TO ALL OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE HERE AT PRESENT IN THIS ROOM AND WHO ARE LISTENING TO THE DODD LIVE STREAM FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS CONVERSATION- MY NAME IS MARCELLA RUIZ AND I AM THE BRANCH CHIEF WITH- IMMIGRATION REFUGEE PROGRAMS BRANCH WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF SOCIAL SERVICES. IN OUR BRANCH- WE ADMINISTER THE REFUGEE SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM THAT HAS ASSISTED IN SUPPORTING THE INTEGRATION OF REFUGEE AND REFUGEE FAMILIES FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS- WE ALSO ADMINISTER MAINLY STATE FUNDED IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS WHICH ARE. MAINLY SUPPORT PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES FOR IMMIGRANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE ADMINISTERS BUT BEFORE I. FOCUS ON THOSE PROGRAMS I WOULD LIKE I HAD TO SPEND SOME TIME LIFTING UP SOME OF THE DATA AND FEDERAL POLICIES- THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR WORK ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN AND USE. I'M I THINK THAT IT'S ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT TO GROUND OURSELVES AND IN THE IN THE DATA CONVERSATION SO GREATLY APPRECIATE DOCTOR BY YAHOO'S PRESENTATION- A FOR CREATING THAT CONTACTS FOR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- I THINK WHETHER. YOU'RE APPROACHING THE CONVERSATION AROUND IMMIGRATION POLICY THROUGH AN EQUITY LANDS OR THROUGH AN EFFICACY LANDS THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY COMPEL THAT WE ARE VERY INTENTIONAL IN THINKING ABOUT HOW WE DO OR DON'T SERVE THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. SO AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. TWENTIES POPULATION IS ROUGHLY FORTY MILLION AND A QUARTER OF THAT POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN ONE OF THE CRITICAL FACTS THAT WE OPERATE WITHIN IN THINKING ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR POLICIES ARE THAT ONE TWO CHILDREN 50% OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE A FOREIGN BORN PARENT AND ONCE AGAIN AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PARENTS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF LEGAL STATUS. BUT WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS OF THE AS OF OUR COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED OR WHO ARE BEING PUT AT RISK OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN FEDERAL POLICY. SO TO THAT END THERE ARE TWO OTHER SPECIFIC POPULATIONS THAT I- OTHER THREE OTHER SPECIFIC POPULATIONS THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KEEP IN MIND IN THIS CONVERSATION. AT THE TIME THAT- THE CURRENT FEDERAL BUT MENSURATION ANNOUNCED THE AT THE DOCK A PROGRAM THERE WERE ROUGHLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MINUTE AND DOCTOR RECIPIENTS CALIFORNIA. JUST THE RECIPIENTS DOESN'T INCLUDE. FAMILIES THAT. MEANS OF THE THAT SUPPORT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY THEY MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON IN THEIR IN THEIR FAMILY WITH WITH LEGAL STATUS AND ABILITY TO WORK LEGALLY. IN IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M. ANSON'S DHAKA HAS ENDED THEY HAVE NOW THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR DHAKA BUT FOR THE END OF THE PROGRAM BY THE BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THERE ARE ALSO ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND- BENEFICIARIES OF A PROGRAM CALLED TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS- MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS. AND THEN FINALLY A SPECIAL NO I THINK TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF UNACCOMPANIED UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHO HAVE ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES- FLEEING MILEY CONDITIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES MAINLY FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. LAST YEAR THERE WERE EIGHT THOUSAND UNACCOMPANIED MINORS PLACED IN IN CALIFORNIA WITH ROUGHLY 42% OF THEM PLACED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I'M WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW FEDERAL POLICIES THAT ARE SPECIAL NOTES ADD TO- IMMIGRANT YOUTH IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES- I OFTEN REFER TO THE POLICIES AROUND CHILD SEPARATION AND CHANGES TO- A RULING CALLED FLOREZ- AS TWO SIDES OF ONE COIN CHILD SEPARATION I THINK MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHICH WAS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGED IN LAST YEAR WHERE THE PARENTS ARRIVING WITH WITH YOUNG CHILDREN FOR CHARGE WITH A WITH THE- WITH THE CRIME AND THEREFORE THEY WERE THEY WERE DETAINED AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED FROM THEM THIS RANGE FROM FROM HOUSTON ADOLESCENT STAGE TWO TODDLERS AND INFANTS. AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENDED THAT PRACTICE THE THEM PURSUED ANOTHER POLICY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF FAMILY DETENTION FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND ALLOW PERHAPS FOR THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF CHILDREN ALONG WITH THEIR FAMILIES NOW BOTH OF THOSE POLICIES ARE ARE ARE CURRENTLY ENJOYING TO BUT THERE IS STILL SOME EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME CHILD SEPARATION THAT ISN'T THAT IS MONNING AT THE BORDER. ALSO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED DHAKA AND TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS AND OVER THE LAST TWO DIGITS YEARS WE HAVE SEEN PRIEST A REMOVAL EFFORTS THAT ARE MORE INDISCRIMINATE UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PARKING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE CRIMINAL CERTAIN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THE ENFORCEMENT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN RATHER INDISCRIMINATE OFTEN RESULTING IN IN DETECTION LONG TERM DETENTION. OF HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD. FINALLY IT WAS MENTIONED ALREADY OTHER PARTS SEE THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR THE WELL BEING OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IS THE PUBLIC CHARGE POLICY. PUBLIC CHARGE POLICY HAS THE INTENT OF RESTRICTING LEGAL IMMIGRATION IT IS CURRENTLY IN JOINED BY I BELIEVE. AS OF LAST FRIDAY FIVE FEDERAL COURTS. BUT WHAT WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED WITH THAT HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE EVIDENCE OF THIS IS IT'S NOTED IN THE IN THE STATE ACTION AGAINST THIS THIS POLICY IS THE CHILLING EFFECT AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS REALLY CRITICAL IMPORTANT BENEFIT PUBLIC BENEFITS. THAT CALIFORNIA IS- PROMOTING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR FAMILIES THE FOR GO THOSE BENEFITS FOR THEM SO EVEN IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE OR FOR THEIR U. S. CITIZEN CHILDREN. M. NOTING I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES. SO I WANNA TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT THE STATE'S RESPONSE IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE IS REALLY ONE OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION SO IN THE FACE OF THIS YEAH. MORE INTENT ENFORCEMENT AND- LIMITATION OF BOTH- BOTH THAT UNLAWFUL AND LAWFUL IMMIGRATION THE STATE IS OPERATING AN IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION THAT. THAT IS FOCUSED ON WELCOMING IMMIGRANTS AND ALSO CREATING PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ARE CRITICAL FOR THE LONG TERM WELL BEING AND INTEGRATION OF IMMIGRANT YOUTH IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. AT THE DEPARTMENT WE ADMINISTERED THE LEGAL SERVICES PROGRAMS WHICH I'VE I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED- THE LARGEST PROGRAMS THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAM WHICH IS ROUGHLY A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WITH THE- ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT INVESTMENT HAPPENING HERE. IN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THAT SUPPORTS NATURALIZATION SERVICES WHICH WE HEARD FROM THE EARLIER PRESENTATION ARE SO CRITICAL FOR IMMIGRATION LAW SUPPORTS REMOVAL DEFENSE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING DEPORTATION IT ALSO SUPPORTS- DOC I SERVICES. WE SUPPORT SERVICES FOR UNACCOMPANIED MINORS TALK TO SERVICES AND- THIS YEAR WE ARE EXPANDING SERVICES ON TO HIGHER ED CAMPUSES WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE C. S. USE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN OUR SERVICES PARTNERS TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES ON ON CALLOUSED. COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THE OTHER SIDE OF OUR WORK IS ENSURING THAT OUR PROGRAMS WHICH WE ADMINISTER ACTUALLY REACH IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS THAT THEY'RE INTENDED TO SERVE THAT WE ARE ENSURING ACCESS AND EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF SERVICE SO JUST KNOW A COUPLE OF THOSE PROGRAMS- CAL FRESH COVERAGE IS CRITICAL. IT'S A CRITICAL ANTI POVERTY MEASURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- THIS YEAR WE HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING WITH THE WICK PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAM- TO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY ACCESSIBLE TO BRING COMMUNITIES. AND WITH OUR NEW HOME VISITING INITIATIVE WE HAVE BEEN RATHER INTENTIONAL MAKING SURE THAT HOMELESS THERE'S- ACTUALLY GOING THE HOME. AND IF YOU WANT TO JUST. OTHER WHO WHO MAKE THAT HELP. AS SERVICE IS PART. I'M THAT'S SAD ENCLOSING I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE AND SUPPORTING- IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION EFFORTS I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE PARTNERS WERE ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICES ON THE GROUND MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY- I AM GRATEFUL TO THE PUBLIC FOR YOUR INTEREST INTO THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THE FAMILIES WHO MAKE CALIFORNIA SUCH A THRIVING STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WERE. AS WE LEAD INTO HIS MORALS PRESENTATION YOU KNOW THAT THE CHILLING EFFECT FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS IS SO FRUSTRATING WHEN WE DO ALL THE WORK TO INTRODUCE THE BILLS MANY OF WHICH ARE REFERENCED IN THIS AMAZING BACKGROUND OF THE WHITE PAPER THAT I HOPE YOU ALL TAKEN READ- IT'S JUST. I SO YOU SAW THIS THESE SIDE BARS TO. WHICH I HAVE TO DO TO KEEP FROM JUST. I DON'T KNOW IMPLODING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT IN AND TO HEAR THAT STATISTIC WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO INTERNALIZE. EIGHT THOUSAND ON ACCOMPANIED MINORS. IS JUST STRIKING. AND WHAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO DO TO PROVIDE THEM- SAFE HARBOR. THANK YOU MS MORROW. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AGAIN RENEE MAILLOT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN IN OUR DEPARTMENT WE ADMINISTER THE MEDIC HELP PROGRAM AND I HAVE THE DISTINCT PLEASURE OF OVERSEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO I HAD A WALL WITH MY STAFF IN TERMS OF THE TWO EXPANSIONS THAT SENATOR MITCHELL I'M MITCHELL HAD MENTIONED SO AS PART OF THE BUDGET I HAVE FOUR TWENTY NINETY FOUR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY. APPROXIMATELY NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WAS APPROPRIATED FOR A FOR BRINGING INTO COVERAGE APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS- BETWEEN THE AGES OF NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS INTO FULL SCOPE COVERAGE INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. THIS NEW POLICY WILL BE EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND ONCE OUR LEGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT SYSTEMS ARE READY THEN WE'LL START WITH THE ACTUAL INVOLVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS BUILDS UPON THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE HAD THAT WAS REFERENCED- WITH THE PYRE BUDGET WHERE WE PULLED IN CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF NINETEEN REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. M. FOR THE POLICY AS WELL AS THIS NEW POLICY THAT WE'RE GOING BORN TO BE IMPLEMENTING. UNDER SB SEVENTY FIVE WE HAVE ESTIMATED A PROBABLY APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE IMPACTED AND OF THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WE ALREADY HAD A ROLE IN THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAM APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. AND THEN THE BALANCE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT INVOLVED IN OUR PROGRAM. WE ACTUALLY DID THE I'M IMPLEMENTATION OF SP SEVENTY FIVE WE HAD AT OUR PEAK ENROLLMENT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ENROLLED IN COVERAGE AND THEN LA COUNTY ALONE WE HAVE. I'M APPROXIMATELY FORTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BENEFITED FROM THAT POLICY. IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM TODAY WE SERVE JUST APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT POPULATION IS SERVED HERE IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS NEW POLICY OF EXPANSION WE WOULD SIMILARLY EXPECT THAT ABOUT A THIRD ELIGIBLE POPULATION THAT WOULD COME INTO COVERAGE WOULD BE SERVED HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND AGAIN OF THE NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WE EXPECT TO COME INTO COVERAGE ABOUT 75% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALREADY ENROLLED IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE. LEÓN UPON THE WORK THAT WE DID WITH SB SEVENTY FIVE. BEEN WORKING WITH ADVOCATES AND ARE COUNTING PARTNERS IN TERMS OF THIS EXPANSION SO WE ARE WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOTICES I HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PACKAGES THE FIRST NOTICE THAT WILL BE GOING OUT TO ARE IMPACTED POPULATION. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON DEVELOPING- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TRANSITION AND WE'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AN ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT PLAN FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THIS WILL COME TO LAY OUT THE- THE LANDSCAPE FOR THE WORK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING FOR THE TRANSITION. THERE WILL ALSO BE A NOTICE- GOING AND SO THE FIRST NOTICE THAT WILL GO OUT WILL BE IN JAN IN NOVEMBER IT WILL BE A GENERAL NOTICE INFORMING THE IMPACT THE POPULATION OF THE CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THEN OUR COUNTIES WILL WORK ACTUALLY AFFECTION WAIT THE CHANGE SO PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM BETTER M. RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDIC COW BY THE USE OF AID CODES WILL THEM IDENTIFY THE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS POLICY. CONNIE SWAP BOTTOM MIKE LEE EMBOLDENED TO FULL SCOPE COVERAGE WHERE THAT COVERAGE WILL TURN. JANUARY ONE SO INDIVIDUALS WILL GET A NOTICE IN NOVEMBER THEY WILL THEN GET A SUBSEQUENT NOTICE AROUND MIDDLE LATE DECEMBER. TELLING THEM ABOUT THE CHANGE IN THEIR COVERAGE COM JANUARY ONE AND THEN THAT WILL BE FOLLOWED UP BY ANOTHER NOTICE FROM OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS BECAUSE DEPENDING UPON THE COUNTIES THAT THEY WERE SIDE AND- I'LL HAVE TO THEN SELECT A MANAGED CARE PLAN ARE AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN A MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN THEIR COUNTY BASED UPON OF THE CONTRACT AND THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. AS WE I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS POLICY WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE DO HAVE A US WEB PAGE THAT IS DEDICATED TO THIS EXPANSION AND THAT IS WHERE WE'LL POST ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE RELATIVE TO THIS EXPANSION THE NOTICE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DEVELOPING THAT WILL BE USED BY THE COUNTIES OR THAT WILL BE SENT OUT BY THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE TRANSLATED INTO THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES THAT ARE USED BY MEDIC HOW WE HAVE NINETEEN THRESHOLD LANGUAGES PLUS. WHICH ALSO- INCLUDES ENGLISH AND I'M ALSO WORKING TO HELP ENSURE THAT THE- ELIGIBILITY AND MOMENT SYSTEMS THAT THAT- ELIGIBILITY POLICIES HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO THEN EFFECTUATE THAT COVERAGE THOUGH COME JANUARY ONE ANYONE KNEW THAT IS APPLYING FOR HANNAH CAL PROGRAM TELL THEM BE PUT INTO THAT FULL SCOPE COVERAGE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. OF THE POLICY. I'M IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US IN TERMS OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THIS POLICY AND I THINK TO THE POINTS MADE REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS RATHER THAN IN SEEING YOU WAIT FEAR FOR PEOPLE. IS POINT PEOPLE TO A PLACE OF INFORMATION BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER SO THROUGH THE- CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PUBLIC CHARGE GUIDE FOR PEOPLE TO REFER TO. AND THEY GIVE SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR PEOPLE AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE LOOKING AT COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT'S AN IMPORTANT POLICY GOAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TERMS OF THIS EXPANSION POLICY OF LOOKING AT COVERAGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT THEY IN. PEOPLE CAN CALL THEY CAN GO TO THEIR MAIN OFFICES THEY CAN APPLY ONLINE THEY CAN USE OUR PAPER APPLICATION THE PAPER APPLICATION IS. ALSO IN ALL THRESHOLD LANGUAGES AS WELL AS IN LARGE PRINT WE ALSO HAVE IN A MOMENT THE SISTERS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE TO ENROL. AND THEN ANOTHER- ACT OF THE BUDGET WAS TO MAKE AVAILABLE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER A TWO YEAR TIME PERIOD. FOR HEALTH NAVIGATORS TO HELP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ALSO- CONDUCT OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO HELP INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT COVERAGE OPTIONS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH INCLUDES MEDI CAL AND COVER CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THAT MONEY CAN BE USED TO HELP ESPECIALLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE HEAVY IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS THEY CAN TARGET THOSE POPULAR AS FOR THOSE DOLLARS. AND HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND COVERAGE OPTIONS THAT. TO THEM AND THE RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AND LEARNING ABOUT THE COVERAGE OPTIONS AND OUR PROGRAM. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT THANK. AS I LISTEN TO YOU I'M OFTEN REMINDED THAT YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT'S ROLE OUR RULES THE LEGISLATURE IS TO APPROPRIATING LEGISLATE. THE ROLE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S IS TO OPERATIONALIZE AND YOU KNOW OUT REACH IS IT REALLY TIP AT TYPICALLY AT THE TOP OF THE LIST IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO. YOU KNOW COVER NOT COMING UP WITH THOSE. COLDS IN OF ITSELF AND THEN TAKE YOU OFF FOR EVERY VEHICLE THAT THINKING YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I MEAN TO DO YOUR WORK AND SO THAT'S WHY THE NAVIGATION FUNDING AND PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMUNITY THAN GOVERNMENT DOES. AND SO I'M NOT I SEE SO MANY PARTNERS IN THE ROOM I C. STAFF FROM SAINT JOHN'S CLINIC AND OTHERS IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE CRITICAL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP US BY DOING THE JOB. AROUND OUT REACH TO HELP WITH TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE CHILLING EFFECT- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE GUY THAT'S BEEN MADE AVAILABLE- WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC CHARGE HOW TO PEOPLE AT AS THAT. SO THE GUY CAN BE ACCESSED BY THE- CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ON THEIR WEBSITE I'M AND WE CAN ALSO MAKE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE I'M I'LL GIVE YOU THE WEBSITE THAT YOU CAN ALSO I'LL LOOK BUT YOU CAN USE TO GO TO THAT. THE GUY DIRECTLY. IT'S H. T. T. P. S. COLIN. I. TWO BACKSPLASHES IMMIGRANT GUIDE DOT CA DOT G. O. V. I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE- ON THE WEBSITE AS WELL TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO A MISTER O'BRIEN. THANK YOU.

SO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE STATES- MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. WHICH IS COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF GRANTS TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO HELP AFFORD COLLEGE- WE DON'T DO STUDENT LOANS EVERY DOLLAR WE DISBURSE IS EVERY STUDENTS TO KEEP. NEVER HAS TO BE PAID BACK. STUFF WAS DONE EXCELLENT JOB IN THE GRAND PRIX FOR YOUR REFERENCE SENATOR PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE OFFER AND FINANCIAL AID- STARTING ON PAGE THIRTY FIVE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED A ONE PAGER THAT I HE WAS INCLUDE THE PACKETS. WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STUDENT A COMMISSION SERVICES AS WELL AS OUR CONTACT INFORMATION. ON THERE BUT- REALLY WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO YOUR STAFF AND THE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION IN THE BACKGROUND- SO A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS NOW. HAS BEEN THE STUDENTS IMMIGRATION STATUS SHOULD NOT BE WHAT HOLDS THEM BACK FROM PURSUING A COLLEGE UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. AND THE STATE FIRST BEGAN TO DEMONSTRATE THIS PRINCIPLE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN WE LED THE NATION IN PASSING- WHAT WHAT WE CALL SIMPLY BILL FIVE FORTY OR EIGHTY FIVE FORTY. WHICH I DECLARED THAT ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS COULD ATTEND OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. AND PAY THE IN STATE TUITION RATE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO PAY WHEN THE ATTEND- OUR INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THE DREAM OF GOING HIGHER EDUCATION WAS STILL OUT OF REACH FOR SO MANY OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AT THE TIME. BECAUSE IT WAS ON AFFORDABLE- IN THE TWO THOUSANDS A SERIES OF STATE BUDGET CUTS LEAD OUR UNIVERSITIES TO RAISE TUITION SEVERAL TIMES. AND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT- ALTHOUGH WE HAD- OPEN THE DOOR FOR SO MANY OF OUR DOCUMENTS SINCE WE'RE PROVIDING THEM WITH THE RESOURCES THEY WERE GONNA. BE NEEDING. TO AFFORD AN ACCESS AND THRIVE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. SO TEN YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT WHICH IS TWO BILLS- AUTHORED BY- ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS IN THIS SPACE CALIFORNIA'S EVER SEEN THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIL STUDIO. AND THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT- CREATED AN APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION CALLED THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION. AND SAID THAT STUDENTS WHO WERE ATTENDING OUR INSTITUTIONS UNDER EIGHTY FIVE FORTY COULD NOW GET STATE FINANCIAL AID MAINLY THROUGH OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS- THE SECOND LARGEST FINANCIALLY PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES AFTER THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM. AND SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE DREAM ACT FOR PRES WE'RE PLEASED TO SAY THAT OVER TEN THOUSAND DREAMER STUDENTS HAVE ATTENDED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND RECEIVE STATE FINANCIAL AID. TO HELP OFFSET THOSE COSTS. HOWEVER AS UNFORTUNATELY IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH THIS POPULATION WE STILL HAVE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS IN PLACE. THAT ARE KEPT US FROM THE THAT CREATED AN INEQUITABLE SITUATION VIRTUALLY WHEN IT CAME TO FINANCIAL AID. SO VERY RECENTLY JUST THIS PAST YEAR IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WERE PLEASED TO SAY. TOOK TWO MAJOR STEPS TOWARDS RECTIFYING THAT AN EQUITY AND PROVIDING- ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO OUR DREAMER POPULATION. THAT WILL HELP THEM AFFORD AND THRIVE IN COLLEGE SO PART OF IT HAD TO DO WITH WHAT WE CALL OUR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. THE DREAM ACT- OPENED UP CAL GRANTS FOR DREAMERS STUDENTS WHO- HAD RECENTLY GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS WE KNOW COMES STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LARGE AND GROWING POPULATION OF WHAT WE SOMETIMES CALL ADULT LEARNERS FOR RETURNING STUDENTS. WHICH INDIVIDUALS WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON DID NOT ATTEND COLLEGE IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL OR MIGHT HAVE ATTENDED SOME COLLEGE BUT SOMETIMES HAD TO DROP OUT DUE TO THE HIGH COST. AND THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT WE CALL ENTITLEMENT MEANS NOT ENTITLED TO A STATE CAL GRANT. THEY CAN'T COMPETE FOR A LIMITED POOL OF CAL GRANTS IF THE NOT A RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. AND THE ORIGINAL DREAM ACT EFFECTIVELY LIMITED DREAMERS ABILITY TO RECEIVE WHAT WE ALL THESE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS SO IT SHOT OUT A LOT OF ADULT LEARNERS AND RETURNING STUDENTS FROM GETTING SICK EIGHT. THIS YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY STATE BUDGET ACT REMOVE THOSE RESTRICT. AND ACTION CONTAINS EXPLICIT. LANGUAGE DREAMERS IN A BEFORE FORTY STUDENTS. ENTITLED TO FULL. BODY WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETING IN APPLYING FOR ALL STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. TIME SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT AND THAT IS ALREADY PAYING DIVIDENDS WE'VE ALREADY AWARDED- JUST YOU KNOW SINCE THIS WENT INTO EFFECT LAST MONTH SEVERAL HUNDRED DREAMERS. HAVE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AND MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY- ADDITIONALLY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SHOWED- LEADERSHIP THIS YEAR. IN PROVIDING ANOTHER HALF TO ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR DREAMER STUDENTS. SO IS IT IT'S MENTIONED- AND A LOT OF YOU IF YOUR ADVOCATES KNOW ALREADY DREAMERS ARE IN ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT. FEDERAL SUBSIDIZED STUDENT LOANS AND FEDERAL WORK STUDY AND BECAUSE- A LOT OF THEM PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE DHAKA STATUS HAVE A REAL CHALLENGE IN BEING ABLE TO. YOU KNOW FIND WORK AND USE THAT INCOME TELL AWESOME POSSUM HOLLY. YOU KNOW OTHER THAN REALLY STRUGGLING AND HAVE THAT SORT OF. TRADITIONAL WORKING WHILE IN COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND SO THE- LEGISLATURE THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LEÓN MONNING. CREATED THE DREAMER SERVER CONSENT OF CRAP PRO. REALLY INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA SO SUPPORTED IN THIS COMMUNITY AND IT WAS WILLING TO GET CREATIVE. UNDER THIS PROGRAM EIGHTY FIVE FORTY STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE CAL GRANTS OR DREAMERS WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE OR VOLUNTEER WORK- SUCH AS INTERNSHIPS RELATED TO THEIR MAJOR COURSE OF STUDIES. AND RECEIVE UP TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL AID ON TOP OF THEIR EXISTING CALIBER AT EIGHT. TO HELP THEM PAY FOR COLLEGE SORT OF VERY EXCITED FOR THIS INDUSTRY MAKE COMMISSION IS GONNA BE ROLLING OUT THE- THE PROGRAM LATER THIS YEAR. WHEN I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WELL THIS DOESN'T TOTALLY MAKE UP FOR THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID UNFORTUNATELY. THE DREAMERS YOU'RE STILL NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE WE DO HOPE THIS WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP SOMEWHAT IN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO PERFORM VOLUNTEER SERVICE OR GET KEY EXPERIENCE- IN A CAREER FIELD THAT THEY MAY BE LOOKING INTO- THROUGH AN INTERNSHIP. AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE THIS IS A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW I KNOW BUT I WANT TO CLOSE OUT THE- WIFE FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY WE'VE HEARD FROM THE SECTORS. REGARDING THIS CHILLING MESSAGE IN HERE IT THE DAY AT THE STUDENT IT CAN SHIN. SOO IT WHO IN OUR CASE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WANT TO FILL OUT THAT DREAM ACT LOCATION. BYE FOR FINDING A UNDERSTANDABLY NERVOUS ABOUT SHARING THAT INFORMATION IS A LOT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THEIR ARMS ABOUT SHARING THAT WILL PICK UP AND- THERE ONE WHETHER IT'S WORTH TAKING THE RISK TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. SO I WANT TO JUST REITERATE A COUPLE OF THINGS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT THE FEDERAL. GOVERNMENT WE VALUE NO WE ARE POPULATION. WE VALUE THE STUDENT POPULATION- AND WITH THE STEVEN A COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING ALL STUDENTS INFORMATION. AND PRIVACY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW WHEN YOU APPLY FOR IT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DREAM THAT. THAT INFORMATION GOES TO US AND ONLY TO US- WE AND FURTHERMORE WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE DON'T AT THIS TIME ANTICIPATE. THAT THE RECEIPT OF FINANCIAL AID EVEN IF THE PUBLIC CHARGE WILL GOES INTO EFFECT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL- BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF- AS PART OF PUBLIC CHARGE. I'M WE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT CHOICES THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS FACED WITH. BUT OUR MESSAGES JUST IF YOU WANT TO PURSUE A COLLEGE EDUCATION. COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO APPLY WE HOPE YOU WILL APPLY FOR FIVE. BILL A SEEK THAT HIGHER EDUCATION AS RENEE STEPPING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT NOT BUDGET POWER. AND HIGHER EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO GET THAT KNOWLEDGE AND THAT POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BILL THEN YOU WE'VE INVESTED DO YOU BELONG HERE AND WE ARE HERE TO SERVE YOU- I WANT TO JUST CLOSE QUICKLY BY NOTED. THAT. RICARDO ACTIVE XIN ON THIS ONE. HERE THAT THE NUMBER ON THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE BEST NUMBER SO- WEBSITE IS THERE C. S. A. C. C. SACK DOT CA DOT G. O. V. AND WE HAVE. A CALL CENTER A STUDENT SUPPORT CALL CENTER WHERE IF BE FURIOUS MISFIRING STUDENT OR CURRENT STUDENT OR IF YOU'RE A PARENT OF AN ASPIRING OR CURRENT STUDENT AND YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. ABOUT HOW TO GET FINANCIAL AID WHETHER YOU'RE ELIGIBLE HOW TO FILL OUT THOSE COMPLICATED FORMS. PLEASE GO AHEAD AND CALL US THE PHONE NUMBER IS ONE EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT C. EIGHT GRANTS. SEE A GRANT AS IN CAL GRANT BUT WITHOUT THE L. I THINK IT'S TWO TWO FOUR SEVEN TWO SIX EIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS A LINE UP OF THOSE. BUT I ASSOCIATED WITH C. A GRANT AND WE DO HAVE SPANISH SPEAKING STAFF AS WELL AS TRANSLATION SERVICE FOR SEVERAL OTHER LANGUAGES. SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THAT'S PAN THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND- APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE ALL DOING TO BE SURE THAT THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR- ACTUALLY GET IMPLEMENTED. TRYING TO FOCUS MOST OF IRAQ'S AROUND PUBLIC CHARGE BECAUSE- THE CHALLENGES THAT WE- CAN. FIND PAST PROGRAMS BUT IF PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL OF PARTAKING. THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET SERVICES RIGHT CAN I GET THE HELP- SO I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION FOR IN RELATION TO SOCIAL SERVICES- AND AGAIN- APPRECIATE- ALL THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON DEPARTMENT. I HAD I DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH US SOME OF THE COUNTY FOLKS ARE. AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TRACK IN SOME SENSES WE DON'T ASK PEOPLE WHAT'S YOUR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND SO FORTH TO SELL. BUT IS ARE THERE IS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AND TRYING DEVELOPED AT LEAST SOME. MECHANISM THERE'S TO TRY TO GET SOME IDEA OF. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. NOT RENEWING SAYING THEY WANT OFF OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE AT THE ONE THAT PRIDE HARDEST AS PEOPLE WHO WOULD QUALIFY TO NEVER SIGN UP BECAUSE THERE D. YOU KNOW IT'S TOUGH HOW DO YOU. TRACK THAT. BUT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY END WHO SAY WELL I'M REALLY AFRAID OF PUBLIC CHART SO I GOT TURNED DOWN I DON'T I'M OUT OF TOWN FRESH ON TURNING AWAY. SO FOR THIS IS THERE SOME EFFORT TO TRY TO- WORKING WITH THE COUNTY IS GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES TO TRY TO. GET A SENSE OF HOW TO WHAT DEGREE THAT'S HAPPENING AT SO I HEAR ANECDOTALLY. BUT THE MORE SYSTEMATICALLY TRY TO TRACK ARE WE HAVING. ARE PEOPLE BASICALLY TURNING DOWN SERVICES THAT WE ARE FUNDING. SO THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE WITH THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS INCLUDING INCLUDING THE COUNTIES. TO TRY TO MONITOR THE PARTICIPATION RATE OF IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS AND- IF YOU LOOK AT AT SOME OF THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD WHERE- THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE ATTESTED TO THE TO THE DROPPING OF PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT ARE. PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE SO THERE IS A PARTNERSHIP THERE AND I AND I AND I WANT TO KNOW ON SENATOR MITCHELL MENTIONED EARLIER ALSO THAT THE NEED FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND THAT IS. PARTNERSHIPS WITH. TRUSTED MESSENGER AND THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN AND OUT REACH AS AS RENEE MENTIONED AND IN THE LEGAL SERVICES. AND SO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO BRING ALL OF THOSE TABLES TOGETHER TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHERE ARE WE SEEING. THE DROP IN PARTICIPATION WHAT IS THE EFFECTIVE- MESSAGING FOR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY REACH THOSE POPULATIONS I APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE I THINK PART OF THE REASON WHY COLLECTED DATA IS SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH RESEMBLE WHICH- WHERE DO I TARGET OUR EFFORTS TO HAVE THE BIG. IMPACT WHERE WHERE IS THE- WE'RE OUT REACH FAILING. WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT AND SO. AND SO HOW DO WE- PROVIDE MORE GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS- BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES SO. WE CAN MAKE MAXIMUM USE OUR RESOURCES. AND THEN RIGHT I AS FAR AS DEPART HEALTHCARE SERVICES OBVIOUSLY IS. THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES VERY INTERESTED IN BOTH DEPARTMENTS HERE- ALSO EDUCATION EVEN THOUGH IT'S- BUT- SO. IN TERMS OF SO YOU KNOW WE PASS. AND AT THE END D. WE'RE FINDING. COVERAGE WHERE PEOPLE DOCUMENT IN. I'LL BE OFF PREVIOUSLY ZERO EIGHTEEN NOW UP TO TWENTY SIX. HOW IN ANY TAUGHT YOU TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THIS. I'M STILL CONCERNED THAT YEAH WE HAVE A GUIDELINE THAT PEOPLE MAY STILL BE AFRAID TO APPLY BECAUSE OF PUBLIC CHARGE IN FACT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY OF THAT WITH RESTRICTED MEDIC COW BECAUSE AT LEAST WITH YEAH. SO I KNOW YOU KNOW TAKE THOSE AND ROLLED INTO FULL SCOPE BUT- I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO ARE DROPPING OFF AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS THAT BECAUSE AT ONE BIG CHALLENGES PUBLIC CHARGES A BIT OF A MOVING TARGET IN PART THE REASON IT'S A MOVING TARGET IS ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING BACK AGAINST. SO TED NIELSEN OFFICIALLY IS THIS TO TAKE PLACE IN THE FIFTEENTH THERE'S OF SUCCESSFUL LAWSUITS CETERA AT SO CAN YOU MAYBE ALSO SPEAK TO HOW THE PART COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTY SO ON THE FRONT LINES TO ENROLLMENT. OF THAT THEY JUST BE VERY FRANK WE HAD A PROBLEM BEFORE WHERE STATE POLICY WAS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DHAKA. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET MEDIC HAL BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS A LETTER SENT COUNTY. IS INDICATING THAT AND TO RECALL. HOW COMPLICATED THE- OUR SYSTEMS ARE DE ELIGIBILITY COMPUTER ACTUALLY REJECTED THE DHAKA EVEN THE OUR POLICY AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WORK AROUND BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO DIRECTION FROM THE AGENCY COUNTIES DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WE'RE DOING IT AND SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DHAKA BEFORE WERE APPLYING EVEN WHEN THEY QUALIFIED THEY WERE TURNED AWAY BY CALIPHATE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T SO I I'M JUST BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I'M GONNA TALK ASK ABOUT HOUSES COMMUNICATION PATH GOING BETWEEN. D. C. S. ANDY COUNTIES ON THE FRONT LINES SO THAT THE PERSON FROM THEM TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISS COMMUNICATING TO PEOPLE- AND- BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE HEAR THAT MESSAGE FROM THEIR ELIGIBILITY WORKER THEY WALK AWAY TO THINK- I'M QUALIFIED HUESO- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOWARD THE BEING SURE THAT THAT COMMUNICATIONS HAPPENING- THAT'S HAPPENING. AND WITH THIS FREQUENCY- THE SPECIALLY WITH POTENTIAL CHANGES THOSE THINGS ARE MOVING. AND WOW DE KLERK HOLLY IS THAT LIVED TO BE SURE TO. IN THE END THE- IS APPLYING- DOESN'T. YOU KNOW THINK THAT THEY GET THE YEAH. AND AS SELF THE SPEED THAT. SO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE DROP OFF SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS CHECKING IN WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL AS ALSO LOOKING AT OUR OWN DATA. WE HAVE NOT IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY APPRECIABLE OKAY I DECLINES IN A MOMENT WE HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL INCREASES IN THEIR HOME AND GIVEN. THAT IN PARTICULAR BUT FOR THAT- POPULATION THAT'LL BE SUBJECT TO THE NEW EXPANSION SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING BUT IN TERMS OF OUR DATA WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY APPRECIABLE CHANGES THAT ARE ANY DIFFERENT. THAN ANY OTHER POINT IN TIME WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT MEDIC HOW HOW IS ELIGIBLE IMMIGRANT LARGE AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE MAKE MORE PEOPLE QUALIFIED EXCEED NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO WE AT THE MORE PEOPLE AROUND THEM TED. AGAIN ROLE WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW LIKE WHICH FRESHER WAS GONNA KOREAN OUT. GIVING SORRY YEAH. BUT IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE HAVE BEEN DOING GIVEN SOME OF THE FEDERAL POLICIES IS WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE IS ONE WILL BE PROVIDING DIRECT GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S REGARDING THIS POLICY WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES ON MAKING SURE THE SYSTEMS ARE ALL WORKING. BECAUSE WE CAN'T IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY UNTIL THE ACTUAL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING ON AS WE EXPECT THEM TO WORK AND THEN WE HAVE TO NOTIFY OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE SYSTEMS ARE READY. FOR THIS POP THEY SHOULD. TO YOUR COMMUTE PATIENTS KEY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU. THE POLICY. THAT WE GIVE THEM IN TERMS OF ART DIRECTION FOR HOW YOU NEED TO BRING THIS. RELATION INTERCOM. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT MISS COMMUNICATING INFORMATION. OUR COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS ARE NOT SAFE EXPERT ON IMMIGRATION FRONT THEY KNOW SOME THINGS BUT WE WANT TO POINT PEOPLE BACK TO. THIS PUBLIC CHARGE GUIDE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THERE TO BE MISCOMMUNICATION. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. IN THE COMMUNITIES FOR THE COVERAGE. WHAT ARE AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IN TERMS OF IF THEY'RE GETTING QUESTION. OUR COMPANY AND- ALSO WAS SEEN I. THE OLD MAN OF. SCRIPT THAT CAN BE USED FOR END OF IT. BUT IT IN MONEY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WE LEVERAGE THE. RESOURCES MAKE AVAILABLE TO. SO. THEIR KNOWLEDGE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED- KNOWING THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES SQUARE NOW YOU HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS THEY MAY NOT BE SO INTO READING EVEN A TRANSLATED DOCUMENTS THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP THEM AND TIGHT THEY CAN TALK. TO THAT THEY CAN GET I MEAN WE WOULD CERTAINLY WHAT PARTNER WITH OUR WONDERFUL PARTNERS OR SOMEONE THERE IN THE AUDIENCE BUT- IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO IF THE ELEGY WORKER DOESN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION. IT'S NOT JUST LIKE WELL WHAT LANGUAGE HE'S BECOME HANDING A DOCUMENT- IT'S GOT IT LIKE THERE'S GOT TO BE A HAND OFF TO SOMEBODY WHO CAN ACTUALLY ANSWER QUESTIONS EXPLAIN SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. YES THAT IS THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE LOCAL RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY SOME PART OF WHAT SOCIAL SERVICES DOES. THEY DO FIND- ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN THEN HELP PROVIDE SOME ILLEGAL ANDERSON THAT'S OF WE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS BUT JUST ALSO IS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT URGES DURING ASSISTANCE OR ARE WE WORKING COUNTIES THAT COUNTIES HAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN IT WE'RE DOING. AS COLLABORATIVE AFTER OKAY WORKING BOTH WITH THE TOWNIES WITH- SOCIAL SERVICES WITH ADVOCATE ORGANIZATION SO THROUGH ALL OF OUR VARIOUS COMMUNICATION STREAMS WE ARE SHARING INFORMATION WITH FOLKS. OUR INTENT IS NOT TO GIVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. TO OUR FAMILIES BECAUSE THIS IS OVERWHELMED. AT LEAST ONE TO POINT PEOPLE THERE ARE TRUSTED- GROUPS IN COMMUNITIES THAT WORK WITH THE IMMIGRANT POP. SO ARE IMMIGRANT ADVOCATES THAT WE WORK WITH WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS WELL IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION AND HOW THEY CAN HELP TO SUPPORT. OUR BENEFICIARIES OR APPLICANTS THAT ARE COMING TO THE RECOGNIZE YOUR LIMITED TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU MORE OF THE DETAILS. THANK YOU. MODEL YOU BETTER BE READY FOR THOSE BUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS THAT. I THINK WE JUST HAD A PRECURSOR. SUB THREE HEARING DON'T FOCUS ON. READY THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE TO SENATOR MITCHELL EXCUSE ME. AND ALL THE STAFF FOR HOSTING THIS EVENT TODAY- DODD SENATOR PAN- AND ALSO SENATE ALLEN WHOSE ACTUALLY VISIT OUR FACILITY THANK YOU. I'M I HAVE WORKED AT GFS FOR EIGHT YEARS AND OVER THE PAST YEAR I'VE MANAGED OUR RESPONSE TO THIS ISLAND SEEKING FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN NEED AT OUR BORDER. THIS SLIDE SHOW OF PHOTOS- HOPEFULLY PLAYING ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF ME HERE IS JUST A SAMPLING OF THE MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME TO THE MIGRANT FAMILY SHELTER THAT JEFF S. OPERATES. EACH ONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS UNIQUE STORY IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A BETTER LIFE. JEFF I STARTED ITS WORK AT THE BORDER OF CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. HELPING JEWISH REFUGEES FIND SAFETY AND A NEW START. THAT MISSION CONTINUES TODAY AS WE ASSIST IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE IN NEED OF ALL FAITHS AND BACKGROUNDS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN JEFF A STAFF AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ENVISIONED IN CONVENED A GROUP THAT IS NOW CALLED THE SAN DIEGO RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK. THE NETWORK WAS INITIATED INTO INCREASED IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THROUGH A HOTLINE. WHERE ANYONE COULD CALL TO GET HELP FOR AN URGENT LEGAL NEED. IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ENDED A PROGRAM CALLED SAFE RELEASE. THE HOTLINE RECEIVED A CALL THAT ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE MOSTLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN DROPPED OFF AT THE SAN DIEGO BUS STATION. PRETTY MUCH NOTHING. NO FOOD NO PLACE TO SLEEP AND IT WAS AROUND TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. IMAGINE FOR A SECOND WHAT I'M DESCRIBING. THESE WERE FAMILY SEEKING ASYLUM IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAD ALL BEEN RELEASED FROM A FEDERAL AGENCY. THE ADULTS HAD ANKLE MONITORS TO TRACK THEIR WHEREABOUTS. MOMS BABIES KIDS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN THE US BEFORE. VERY FEW HAD WARM CLOTHING FOR THE COOL OCTOBER NIGHT. THEY WERE TIRED HUNGRY DE HYDRATED AND SOMEWHERE SICK. AND IN C. DIEGO THE MAIN BUS STATION. IS MORE LIKE AN OUTDOOR TICKET COUNTER. THERE'S NO PLACE TO SIT INSIDE. A NOT A LOT OF BUSES ARE LEAVING AT TEN PM ON A FRIDAY. SO IF AN ORGANIZATION DIDN'T STEP FORWARD TO HELP. THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS AND OVER TIME WE RECOGNIZE MAYBE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ON THE STREET. CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS TEMPORARILY HOMELESS AND AT HIGH RISK FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SO WITH NO END TO THE DROP OFFS IN SIGHT THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE MIGRANT FAMILY SHELTER BEGAN. THE NAME WAS BORN A LITTLE BIT OUT OF URGENCY NOT. A KILLER CREATIVITY OR OR- GOOD INTENTION- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EFFORT THERE WAS NO FUNDING TO DO THE WORK. WE HAD STATE VOLUNTEERS WHO CAME TO HELP PEOPLE TAKING SHIFTS AFTER WORKING THEIR DAY JOBS. THE SHELTER MOVE SIX TIMES BEFORE LANDING IN OUR CURRENT LOCATION. ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT LOCATION GENEROUSLY PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO IS ALSO TEMPORARY. AND WE WILL HAVE TO MOVE AGAIN BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. WHEN FAMILIES ARRIVED AT THE SHELTER. WE DO A BRIEF MEDICAL SCREENING TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT NEED URGENT MEDICAL CARE. WHEN FAMILIES ARRIVE AT THE SHELTER WE GIVE THEM WATER FRESH FOOD. NEW CLOTHING. AND A WARM SHOWER. WHEN FAMILIES ARRIVE AT THE SHELTER WE GIVE THEM A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHEN FAMILIES ARRIVED AT THE SHELTER THEY CAN FINALLY PUT THEIR GUARD DOWN. THEY CAN START THINKING ABOUT BUILDING A BETTER LIFE. TO FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE WORK WE DO. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A WOMAN WHO I MET WHO CAME TO THE SHORT SHELTER DURING SOME OF OUR VERY EARLY MONTHS. SHE ARRIVED IN VAN DRIVEN BY BORDER PATROL CONTRACTORS. SHE HAD TWO YOUNG BOYS AGES FOUR AND SIX AND A BABY ATTACHED TO OUR CHEST IN A MAKESHIFT DROP. I HAVE TWO KIDS TO- AND I THINK I REMEMBER THINKING WELL SHE REALLY MUST BE EXHAUSTED. WE GIVE THE FAMILY WATER AND SOME ORANGES AS THEY ARRIVED AND THEY SO CLEARLY REMEMBER HOW HAPPY THE BOYS WERE TO SEE THE ORANGES. WE WERE DELIGHTED TO PUSH PIECES OF THE ORANGES INTO THEIR MOUTH WITH JUICE RUNNING DOWN THEIR FACES. THE MOM HELD BACK TEARS WE- WHEN OUR STAFF TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS AT A SHELTER SHE WAS SAFE. WE WOULD HELP HER CALL HER FAMILY GIVE HER FOOD AND CLOTHING. SHE ALMOST LOOKED TOO TIRED TO CRY. TO DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES HAD INCREDIBLE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE RAPID RESPONSE FUND AND MANY PRIVATE DONORS AND VOLUNTEERS. THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE SHELTERS AROUND SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION SUPPORTS THE OPERATIONS AND TWO POINT THREE COVERS THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH COMPONENTS. IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE HELPED MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND FAMILIES. REPRESENTING MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. OVER HALF OF WHICH OUR CHILDREN. WE OFTEN SAY THAT THANK YOU. WE OFTEN SAY THAT RUNNING THE SHELTER IS A COMMUNITY EFFORT NOT A JEFF BASS ONE. MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS HAVE COME TO HELP AT OUR SHELTER IN THE PAST YEAR. FOR SOME INVOLVEMENT IN THE SHELTER IS A PERSONAL RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING. ABOUT THE INCREASING ANTI IMMIGRANT RHETORIC ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. WHAT I HAVE COME TO REALIZE IS THAT HELPING THIS MOM AND HER KIDS. AND ALL THE FAMILIES LIKE THEM IS NOT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED. THIS WORK IS A CLEAR TIED TO OUR FOUNDING WORKERS JEFF BASS SHORT TERM SPECIFIC HELP FOR PEOPLE NEW TO THIS COUNTRY FOOD SHELTER AND A CLEAN SHIRT. THIS IS WHAT WE WERE FOUNDED TO DO. FOR MANY MONTHS WE HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SOMETIMES IN TWO HUNDRED NEW PEOPLE A DAY. ALMOST A THOUSAND NEW PEOPLE EACH WEEK COMING TO THE SHELTER. TYPICAL STAYS LESS THAN THREE DAYS. LOOKING BACK I AM STILL AMAZED AT HOW WE FOUND A WAY. WE TOOK IN ALL THE ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES RELEASED TO US AND WE FOUND A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP. WE NEVER LET THEM GO TO THE STREET. IT WAS DIFFICULT WORK IT IS DIFFICULT WORK. NOW THAT THE MIGRANT PROTECTION PROTOCOL OR REMAIN IN MEXICO PROGRAM IS IN FULL FORCE. THE DAILY ARRIVALS HAVE SLOWED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED NEW PEOPLE EACH WEEK. ABOUT FIFTY YOU'RE SO SLEEPING IN THE SHELTER EACH NIGHT. THE STILL A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COULD BE SLEEPING ON THE STREET. AND YET WITHOUT A CLEAR PATH FOR IMMIGRATION POLICY AND NUMEROUS LAWSUITS CURRENTLY PENDING THIS LOWER NUMBER FEELS LIKE IT COULD CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT. WE KNOW OUR GAS WE KNOW FROM OUR GAS. THAT THE HOLDING CELLS AND ATTENTION ARE REFERRED TO AS YOU LET US OR ICE BOXES. CHILLING PLACES WITH NO COMFORT. AND WE DO NOT SERVE BURRITOS. BECAUSE THE FAMILIES TELL US THAT THE BURRITOS THEY WERE GIVEN TO EAT WE'RE STILL FROZEN. SO OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS TOGETHER. TO HELP THEM FEEL SAFE AND WARM. SAFE AND WARM THAT IS OUR JOB. FOR MANY FAMILIES OUR SHELTER IS THE MIDDLE OF A VERY LONG JOURNEY JEFF S. IS GRATEFUL TO BE IN A GREAT STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE ARE FORUMS LIKE THIS CONSIDERING THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND FOR PARTNERS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND FIERCE ADVOCATES LIKE ME STILLER RELEASE WHO SPOKE EARLIER. BUT AS MUCH WE'VE DONE TO HELP FAMILIES THROUGH THIS TIME OF CRISIS. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO CELEBRATE. AS I MENTIONED WE RECOGNIZE THE FEDERAL POLICY CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME. AND WE STILL HAVE MANY FAMILIES COMING THROUGH OUR DOOR. TO CONTINUE TO KEEP CHILDREN LIKE THESE. ON YOUR OWN POWER POINT YOU CAN SEE SAFE. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT. TO KEEP FUNDING THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE SHELTER TO FIND A WAY TO FUND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS TO HELP ASYLUM SEEKERS DOCUMENT THE ABUSES IN THE TRAUMAS THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED WHEN THEIR CASES. AND TO KEEP UP THANKS FOR THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR WATER IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE WAY AN ASYLUM SEEKING CHILD COULD ENTER OUR STATE AND I APPRECIATE BEING HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE WAYS WE CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP FAMILIES WITH IMMIGRANT BACKGROUNDS. SAFE AND WARM IN THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. AS WE SAY IN THE SAN DIEGO RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK NO WIND IN OUR COMMUNITY STANDS ALONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH MASSIVE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATORS FOR CREATING THE SPACE WHERE WE CAN COMMUNICATE WAS ARE THEY JUST RAISE OR AN ORAL HEARING WHAT IS GOING ON WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY I KNOW THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO EXPRESS HOW WE FEEL WHAT IS GOING ON OUR COMMUNITY BUT I CAUGHT WITH MY COLLEAGUES COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO ARE REPRESENTING A COMMUNITY. THAT PEOPLE USE OUR- SO- THEN YOU JUST START. SOCIAL DETERMINES WHAT IS SOCIAL DETERMINES. SORRY SOCIAL DETERMINES OUR- THINGS THAT'S PLACED- BASED THAT IMPACTED. ONCE LIFE QUALITY CONDITION. AND IT ALSO SHOWS THE OUTCOME- HEALTH IMMINENT HEALTH- THAT IT CONDITION TO BE HOUSING SCHOOL FOOD ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE LIVE JOB WELL WE HAVE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT MAINLY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WE HAVE TO YOU THAT SYSTEM THEORY SAYS LIKE WHAT IS THE SOCIETY DOING FOR US. WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY WHAT'S A FAMILY AND IT GOES TO INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN SO WE HAVE TO LOOK KIND OF FORM THE FAMILY DYNAMIC THAT WED IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCES AND MOST IMMIGRANT REFUGES ARE THE MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THE LOSS THE PRE AND POST MIGRATION STRESSORS TRAUMA LOSS THAT'S WHAT IT'S IMPACTED SO DODD GOES DOWN TO DEPENDS WHAT AGE GROUP WE LOOK AT FOR CHILDREN IF IT WAS ZERO TO SEVENTEEN THAT'S SUBJECT TO SUIT TOM THE LIFESTYLE. THE POLITICAL GRANDMA THE ENVIRONMENT THIS OCCASION A DISCRIMINATION ALL THAT MAYBE I'M TALKING ABOUT AND BLACK COMMUNITY EMIGRANT. RAFI MEETS SO WHEN WE TALK. ABOUT CHILDREN AND FAMILY LET ME GIVE A LITTLE BIT NUMBER I SAW THE EARLIER DATA. FULLER HOME SITES WHAT JANET BED I'M UNFORTUNATELY THE AFRICANS WHO ARE THE CARIBBEAN'S DATA SHOWS OTHER IMMIGRANTS. BUT I DID MY LITTLE NUMBER SAY'S LIKE- STUDY SHOWS THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT HAS FOUR POINT MILLION. FOR M. BORN BLACK IMMIGRANTS THAT INCLUDED CARIBBEAN AFRICAN ORIGIN. WITH THAT THE FIRST. HAITI IS THE FIRST AT JAMAICA'S A NUMBER ONE NUMBER HE D. IS A SECOND THE THIRD IS NIGERIAN AND YET THE UPON THE FORCE OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT SECOND LARGEST STATE. HAS THAT AFRICAN OR CARIBBEAN BORN IMMIGRANTS IMAGINE THAT SO HOW DO WE DO WITH THOSE CHILDREN SUIT. MENTAL HEALTH IS THE BIG IMPACT FOR IMMIGRANT REFUGEE. BECAUSE. A HIDDEN PROBLEM IT'S NEVER BEEN TALKED NOT ONLY THAT THERE'S NO SERVICE THAT'S CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. I'M A CLINICIAN BY DISCIPLINE SO WHEN WE TREAT SOMEONE WE GO DE CLINICAL LOOK THAT DOESN'T WORK AND SOME OF US BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAME FOR WHAT REMAINS TO US IS SERVICE. AND THUS FAR WE HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANT REFUGEE WOULDN'T TALK TO CHILDREN CHILDREN ARE SUBJECTED AS I SAID THE FAMILY LIFE WHEN YOU GO TO SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THE TAE. TRANSITIONAL IS YOUTH THAT SEVEN DIFFERENT HAS CLOSE TO A PROBLEM OF MINUTE ISSUE WHICH IS HARD TO TREAT. BECAUSE ON ONE MOST IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THE REFUGEES THEY CLINCH TOOK ON COMMUNITY BECAUSE COLD HARD TO REACH COMMITTEE TYPE THAT NAME BY THE WAY WOULD NOT HARD TO REACH WE JUST UNDER SERVICE OR WE CAN BE A RICH.

FGM FEMALE. JIM TIME INFORMATION THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUE AMONG OUR CHILDREN. BUT AGAIN WE DON'T COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT HOW TO PREVENT AND IS THAT THERE IS A PUNISHMENT CRIMINALIZATION WHICH DEPARTMENT OF HOUSE- IT WAS JUST A WELFARE CAUGHT I GUESS. IF YOU HAVE PRACTICE BUT WE SEE THAT WITHIN OUR CHILDREN BUT NORMALLY THAT TO TRY MY THE FACT THEY FACING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHAT THE OUR CHILDREN HOUSES IMPACT BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE TO STEP UP OFF AGAIN COALITION WORKING WITH. HOME LIKE SECURITY CREATED THIS THE FIRST WESTERN OUR IF JIM A COALITION TOGETHER OKAY WE ALSO DOING SOME ADVOCACY GROUP WHO HAS DEPARTMENT- OUR IMAGES M. MENTAL HAVE STRESS HEARTS IN SACRAMENTO.

SO WE'VE BEEN DOING ADVOCACY GROUP BY. ADMISSION NOW WITH ON TO TEASE SUCH US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OFFICE ANY AS STAKEHOLDERS GATHERING CREATING A SPACE LIKE THIS AROUND TABLE DISCUSSING WHAT IS THE CURRENT ISSUE HOW DO WE HELP THOSE DETAINEES. WHO DOESN'T HAVE A LANGUAGE WHO DOESN'T HAVE A SOCIAL SUPPORT HERE BUT HE'S BEEN THROWING JUST BECAUSE THIS THAT THE PUT THE CURRENT. POLITICAL CLIMATE HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE EITHER OF- THE ISSUE OF FGM WITHOUT A PUNISHING THE COMMUNITY THE WOMEN DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CHOICE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HER CULTURE AND FAMILY. AND THE PUNISHMENT AND HERE IN IN MY STATE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO PREVENT THAT THIS IS NOT A CHOICE. I HAVE TO HOW IDENTITY IDENTIFIED AS TO WHERE I BELONG THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME PROUD THAT'S WHY I'M I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MYSELF. BECAUSE OF THE BORDER JUST BECAUSE I WRITE IN UNITED STATE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO HOW TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THIS IS WHAT WE DOING- SO WE CALL. UPON ALL THIS STAKEHOLDERS LOADING YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO COME UP WITH THE IDEA SO WITH THIS PROJECTS GOING ON NOT ONLY THAT- RIGHT NOW WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. DO. WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF NOT ONLY CHILDREN BUT. COMMITTEE ON LARGE. HOW TO REDUCE THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH SO PEOPLE CAN BE TREAT IT- THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS THAT LEADS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH. THEY SAY SOCIAL DETERMINES WHAT ONE OF EITHER WANTED TO AS A MAJOR FACT THAT BAD SO UNLESS YOU HAVE TO COME UP. SUCH AS THE SOLUTION- THIS PROJECT WHAT WE DOING ADVOCACY THEN WE COME UP IDEA WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO TALK THE PROBLEM WHAT IS. A LOT OF STUDY BEING DONE WHAT IS BEING LOST ME AND WITH IMMIGRANT REFUGEE COMMITTEE A LOT OF- YOU KNOW ON THE STUDY BEING DONE WHAT THE FACTORS OF WHAT IS MEANT TO BE A REFUGEE. MY SISTER SHARING WHAT IS SHE DOING DAY TO DATE BUT HOW DO WE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO RESULT WAS WHAT WE HEAR. TODAY SO. AS A SIDE AS ANY OTHER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY THE AFRICAN DESCENDED COMMUNITY IS WORKING HARD I'M PROUD TO SAY AFTER YOU CAN CALL SHOULD WHICH IS- THE COMMITTED RAPE AND ORGANIZATION THAT SPEAKS MORE THAN TEN AFTER. WHICH IS I'M A CLINICIAN ALL JIM SPEAK MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGES THAT'S THE KIND OF THINGS. I'LL GIVE EXAMPLE. THE CAMERA LADY FROM DETENTION. CENTER SHE'S SIX MONTHS PREGNANT SHE WAS REFERRED TO US. LUCKILY YOU PROUD TO SAY YOUR PHONE CALL THE WHEN WE SEE WE WENT- INTEGRATED HER- SO I FIRST SHE WASN'T REALLY HAPPY SHE WAS RESISTING HELP BECAUSE OF HER STICK MOTHER FEAR. THE FACT WE COME FROM PRE AND POST TRAUMA IT IN PRE MIGRATION WE DON'T HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC CONSTITUTE. POLICE DOESN'T MEAN OUR FRIEND RIGHT. NOT FRIEND HERE EITHER BUT AT LEAST. SO. BECAUSE OF THAT WE DON'T HAVE NO TRUST. SO WE ARE STILL DEALING M. BUT THE REASON I BROUGHT THIS EXAMPLE IS I'LL TELL YOU HOW CULTURE MEANS TO US. AFTER WAS BECAUSE NATIVE LANGUAGE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SPOKE WITH HER. SHE'S NOT SMILING TO START CRYING HARD. THE FACT MIKE SHE FEELS THERE'S SOMEONE AFTER SIX MISTRIAL RULING THROUGH ALL ELEVEN COUNTRIES TO GET HERE. AND THE FIRST THING SHE ASK IS WHAT DO I GET MY FOOD. DO NOT ASK ANY URGENT BUT THE FOOD WAS SOMETHING WHAT. CREATE A BELONGINGNESS SHIP SAFE THAT'S WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A COMPLEX TO UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AS A PERSON AS A CULTURE. BUT WE MUST COME AND THE MIDDLE TO REACH OUT LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE AND COME TO WITH SOME SORT OF. SUPPORT INCLUDING FIND A LOCATION. THE REGULAR WAY WORKING FUNDING DEBT. SO COLD ORGANIZATION IS NOT SHOWING THE- POSITIVE OCTOBER AT LEAST THE- OUTCOMES WE EXPECTED TO BE. SO WE ALSO HAVE OTHER WAY TREATING THIS. AN OPERATION LOS M. PARKS ACROSS PHYSICAL AND THE MENTAL EMOTIONAL DOMAIN FROM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LOSSES LOSING FRIENDS LOSING THE NEIGHBORS LOSING THE STATUS OF THE ORIGIN OF THE COUNTRY ALL UP ON THAT IT TAKES AWAY OUR SELF ESTEEM WILL BE BE COME HERE UNDEAD ALSO REDUCE OUR IDENTITY ON IS A JANET ISSUE AMONG AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN- SO WE'LL HAVE TO COME OUT WITH THE TREATMENTS I'M AN AFRICAN CALLED ISSUE LATELY BEEN WORKING HARD MY COLLEAGUE DR SAVANT THE WHO IS A- THE OUTSTANDING RESEARCHER HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS JOB IS. SO WE HAD TO COME UP WITH THE TREATMENT IT'S CALLED- CACHO LOSS THERAPY MODEL WE HAVE A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. PROTECT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE TREATMENT BUT. I DON'T FEEL LIKE NONE OF US WORKING FOR THE IMMIGRANT COMING FOR A CERTAIN CULTURE THAT STUDY HASN'T BEEN AT LEAST NOT TESTED THAT SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOSS THAT'S A BIG TRAUMA EVEN HERE WHEN I STATE FOR YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO PREACH ABOUT THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. IT'S A LOSS OF CULTURE IT LOSS OF IDENTITY WAS WAS STRUGGLING MORE SO FOR US FOR IMMIGRANTS COULD BE WHEN WE COME HE WOULD IDENTIFY THE BLACK WOMEN THEY DON'T CALL ME ETHIOPIA LADY. SO WE HAVE TO DO A MULTIPLE LAYER OF DISCRIMINATION AS WELL. THAT'S THE REASON WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LAWS WHAT IT MEANS TO US. AND ALSO MIKE RIGHT MY TIME OKAY SO SHE WAS TELLING ME AND GENERAL WE HAVE THIS TREATMENT THAT ADDRESSES. I KNOWLEDGE- CULTURE ENDED DIFFERENCES OUTCOME. ANON IS THE MISTRESS KNOWLEDGE THE TRAUMA AND ALSO COME OUT WAS COPING MECHANISM FROM A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS THE KIND OF TREATMENT WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATE AND SUPPORT SO. I CHALLENGE YOU AND ASK YOU ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND DUMP YOU ELECTIVE OFFICIALS TO PARTNER WITH US. TO TALK OVER THIS NONE STOP A TRAUMA ISSUE AMONG AFRICAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HE WAS VERY POWER. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATORS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ALL TODAY ABOUT THE NEEDS OF UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOU. MY NAME IS- DOES A VERY POWERS AND THE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WITH THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. CLC REPRESENTS ALL- CHILDREN DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS AND LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTY. IN TOTAL WE REPRESENT OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FOSTER YOUTH ACROSS CALIFORNIA MISTER POWERS CAN YOU MOVE THE MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU I SEE THERE ARE TV GUIDE. ABSOLUTELY HOPE THAT'S BETTER. SO MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE UNDOCUMENTED OR OTHERWISE IN NEED OF IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE AND MY JOB AS C. L. C.'S IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY. IS TO TRAIN CLC ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ISSUES FACED BY UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH. TO WORK WITH C. L. C. ATTORNEYS TO IDENTIFY THE IMMIGRATION NEEDS OF OUR CLIENTS. ARE AND WITH M. BEADS. CHRISTIAN REPRESENTATION AND IN A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES PROVIDE DIRECT REPRESENTATION TO OUR CLIENTS IN NEED OF IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE. I ALSO THINK YOU I ALSO REVIEW AND REVISE ALL- SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE PREDICATE ORDERS- BEFORE THEY'RE SUBMITTED TO THE JUDGES AND DEPENDENCY IN LA COUNTY. AND IN SOME PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING CASES I WILL APPEAR IN COURT AND EXPLAIN TO THE COURT THE BASIS FOR THE SEARCH REQUEST OR AT THE IMPACT THE CHILD'S IMMIGRATION CASE CAN HAVE ON THE DEPENDENCY CASE. SO TODAY I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. HOW UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH ENTERED THE STATE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY FACE AND HOW THEY CAN BE BETTER SUPPORT. SO FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS WHO UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH ARE. THEY ARE CHILDREN WHO CAME INTO THE STATE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FOR ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE UNDOCUMENTED AND THIS INCLUDES CHILDREN WHO ARE IN IMMIGRATION REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CONTACT WITH IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. SO TO CLARIFY CHILDREN IN THE STATE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ARE DE LEÓN CHILDREN IN THE STATE EXCUSE ME THE FEDERAL FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. CHILDREN WHO ENTER THE STATE FOSTER SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ABUSED OR NEGLECTED BY A PARENT OR CAREGIVER DCFS FILED THE PETITION IN DEPENDENCY COURT. AND THE CHILDREN ARE PLACING DCFS CUSTODY IN CONTRAST CHILDREN IN THE FEDERAL FOSTER CARE CAN. INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WHO HAVE CROSS INTO THE UNITED. GUARDIAN THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTED AS UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN TRANSFERRED TO THE CARE OF OFFICE OF REFUGEE SETTLEMENT NO SPONSOR IS AVAILABLE TO CARE FOR THEM SO THEY ARE TRANSFERRED TO LONG TERM FEDERAL FOSTER CARE. NOW THERE IS SOME CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL SYSTEMS SOME OF OUR CLIENTS IN THE STATE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM- ENTERED AS UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN. THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTODY THEY WERE THEN RELEASED TO A SPONSOR THERE'S A DISINTEGRATION OF THE FAMILY UNIT MAYBE THERE'S ABUSE ABANDONMENT OR NEGLECT. AND THEN THE CHILD WAS- DCFS BECAME INVOLVED AND THE CHILD WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE CLIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED INTO THE UNITED STATES THEY ENTER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM WHEN THE TRAFFICKING WAS DISCOVERED WE HAVE CLIENTS WHO HAVE ENTERED THE UNITED STATES ALONE IT THEY FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS THEY HAVE. NO FAMILY OR FRIEND CONNECTIONS- IT DCFS BECOMES INVOLVED THAT WAY WE ALSO HAVE MANY CLIENTS WHO ENTERED THE UNITED STATES AS INFANTS THEY'VE LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES- THERE IS SOME ABUSE POSSIBLY NEGLECT- FROM THEIR PARENTS. AND DCFS BECOMES INVOLVED. ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY. OUR CLIENTS HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF EXPERIENCES AND ENTER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND ALTHOUGH THEIR EXPERIENCES VERY ALMOST ALL UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH QUALIFY FOR SOME FORM OF RELIEF. WELL ALMOST ALL UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA QUALIFY FOR SOME AVENUES TO LEGAL STATUS THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH. RECEIVE THE IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED TO TAP ACCESS THAT RELIEF AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BECAUSE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO LEAVE FOSTER CARE WITHOUT OBTAINING LEGAL STATUS BE SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS AS THEY TRY TO TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD AND THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE THE INABILITY TO LEGALLY WORK. THEY CAN'T ACCESS MANY FORMS OF FINANCIAL AID AND THEY FACE THE CONSTANT FEAR OF BEING DETAINED BY ICE. SO TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN FOSTER YOUTH NEED ASSISTANCE FIRST ASSESSING OUR IMMIGRATION NEEDS AND ALSO BEING LINKED WITH IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION THE CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A FOSTER YOUTH NEEDS IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE. IS DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THAT FOSTER USES UNDOCUMENTED AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO STEP PROCESS. FIRST WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CHILD IS BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND IF NOT WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT CHILD HAS ALREADY RECEIVED STATUS. IN OBTAINING A COPY OF THE CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE EARLY ON IN THE DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS IT'S ESSENTIAL TO LINKING THE CHILD WITH IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. CALIFORNIA LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT THE COURT ORDER THAT A PERSON TO MAKE IT BE PRODUCED IF THE COURT. EITHER DETERMINES THAT REUNIFICATION SERVICES TO THE PARENTS AREN'T GOING TO BE OFFERED OR IF THE COURT TERMINATES THOSE REUNIFICATION SERVICES. BUT FOR MANY CHILDREN THIS DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF REUNIFICATION SERVICES. DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR MANY YEARS IF AT ALL. AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE EVEN WHEN THE JUDGE DOES MAKE THE ORDER REQUIRING THE PRODUCTION OF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE THERE ISN'T ALWAYS THAT FOLLOW UP NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS OBTAINED. SO IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MANY JUDGES REQUESTED THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE BE ATTACHED EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS TO THE JURISDICTION DISPOSITION REPORT BUT AGAIN AT THIS PRACTICE ISN'T ALWAYS FOLLOWED. AND EVEN IF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS OBTAINED HE DETAILS ABOUT A CHILD'S IMMIGRATION STATUS MAY REMAIN UNCLEAR. OFTEN A CHILD PARENT OR CAREGIVER IS THE PARTY WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE CHILD'S IMMIGRATION CASE IF THE CHILD IS IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS IF A CHILD IS IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION IF APPLICATIONS FOR STATUS HAVE BEEN FILED ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD. AND WHEN THE CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THAT PARENT OR CAREGIVER IF THEY LOSE THAT LINK TO THAT INFORMATION AND AS A RESULT IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE HAD MANY CHILDREN IN DCFS CUSTODY RECEIPT AND ABSENTIA DEPORTATION ORDERS. FOR FAILURE TO ATTEND AN IMMIGRATION HEARING BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD AN IMMIGRATION HEARING THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ATTEND. WISHIN THAT WE PROPOSE TO THIS. IS TO IMPLEMENT AS A PRACTICE. THAT PARENTS OR GUARDIANS TURN OVER COPIES. OF THE CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND IMMIGRATION RELATED DOCUMENTS EARLY ON IN THE DEPENDENCY PROCESS PREFERABLY AT THE INITIAL HEARING. THE CHILD HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BEING BORN OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND IN NEED OF IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE. ARE WE NEXT NEED TO LINK THAT CHILD WITH IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESS AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT ENTITLED TO GOVERNMENT APPOINTED REPRESENTATION IN IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS. LEGAL REPRESENTATION IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL CRITICAL IN TODAY'S POLITICAL CLIMATE WHERE CHILDREN ARE FACING INCREASED PUSH BACK FROM U. S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND THE RULES RELATED TO IMMIGRATION RELIEF ARE CHANGING ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS. IN MANY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE RECEIVE THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE NECESSARY TO OBTAIN IMMIGRATION RELIEF. AS A RESULT OF A LEVEL THAT ASSISTANCE- THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE THAT A FOSTER YOUTH GETS ON OUR IMMIGRATION CASE VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE AND LA WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT IT CLIENTS. ASSESS THEIR IMMIGRATION NEEDS PREPARE THE ORDERS THAT THEY NEED TO ACCESS FOR EXAMPLE SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS. AND LINK THEM TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS WHO CAN DIRECTLY REPRESENT THEM I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT DCFS RECENTLY SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED THAT STATIC. AND THAT'S WHAT IT IS REPRESENTING MANY OF OUR CITIES ELIGIBLE CLIENTS. SIMILAR SITUATION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS A MEMO OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE SAME DIEGO VOLUNTEER LAWYER PROGRAM TO WORK WITH SUCH APPLICANTS MAY ALSO PARTNER WITH OTHER A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK WITH- THERE OTHER CLIENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER FORMS OF RELIEF. AND THEY WORK WITH COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS TO INVEST IN ARRANGING A MEDICAL EVALUATIONS TRANSPORTATION INTERVIEWS OBTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS. WANT TO CONTRAST THAT WITH THE EXPERIENCE IN SACRAMENTO IN PLASTER COUNTIES WHERE OUR ATTORNEYS AT SEAL C. TRY TO LOCATE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS REPRESENT OUR CLIENTS IN THEIR IMMIGRATION CASES BUT WE ROUTINELY HAVE TO PAY PRIVATE COUNSEL TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CLIENTS GET IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION. SO ON THE WHOLE CALIFORNIA HAS A PATCHWORK SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING REPRESENTATION TO UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH AND THE SYSTEM IS WORKING SOME BUT FAR TOO MANY UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND THEIR- AGING OUT OF THE SYSTEM WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN. WITHOUT EVER HAVING BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ACCESS LEAVE THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. AT THE SOLUTION THAT WE PROPOSE TO THIS IS STATEWIDE FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION FOR UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. ADD TO THIS NCLC IS CO SPONSORED A BILL MAYBE THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR I HAD THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN YOUR MATERIALS- AND THAT WOULD ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR QUALIFIED LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REPRESENT UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH. AND THEIR IMMIGRATION CASES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THIS FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH DON'T LOSE ACCESS TO THE IMMIGRATION STATUS AT THE QUALIFY FOR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY OUR DEPENDENCE ON THE COUNTY. AND IT'S NECESSARY TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF A DOCUMENT A FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE INVITE- LET ME START BY AGAIN THINKING YOU- AND ALSO FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND TAKING YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THE DATE- BUT ALSO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE IMMIGRATION AS ONE OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN WILL BE IN I'M IN LA COUNTY AS WELL AS AT THE SAME- MY NAME IS JOSEPH GELATIN I'VE BEEN THE DIRECTOR POLICY NOT BECAUSE IF WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WOULD NATIONAL IMPACT WHAT BANDS THE RIGHTS. OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR AND THE BUDGET UP ON SIGNIFICANT PROPOSES TO THAT STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR IMMIGRANTS BUT THEN ALSO CREATES A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT AND STAY FOR ALL OF THEM SOME OF THOSE VICTIMIZED IT VICTORIES INCLUDE INVESTMENT TO THE CENSUS INVESTMENT TO WAS HOW HEALTHCARE INVESTMENT TOWERS- AND MAKING A PERMANENT- BUDGET ITEMS- LEGAL SERVICES TO HELP THOSE THOSE EMERGENCY NEED AND MOST RECENTLY A POTENTIAL ALLOCATION OF FIVE MILLION FOUR DOT COM- LEGAL AND FILING FEES GIVEN THAT WE HAVE AT A PAN THE CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT. JULY WAS ALSO SPONSORED LEGISLATION THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WOULD ALLOW UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND THAT CITIZENS TO BE APPOINTED TO BOARD AND COMMISSION SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT FOR MAKERS TO BE INTEGRATED BUT ALSO A SPONSOR OUT LEGISLATION TO CREATE A NEW CAR GRANT AS MENTIONED BEFORE- BUT ALSO INCLUDE A DREAM LACE ON IN ALL COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND BECAUSE THEY SO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS HAVE A SOMEONE TO TALK TO BUT THEN ALSO EXPANDED DREAM LOAN PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO ACTUALLY ADVANCING INTO PROFESSIONAL. DEGREES OUT WHY WE CELEBRATE THESE ADVANCEMENTS THAT A LOT MORE THAT THE NEEDS TO BE DONE I'M ANDY CELEBRATION ESSENTIALLY MARKS A REALITY IT TO TELL REALITY WHAT IS THAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OUR STATE PASSED PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WITH THE MAJORITY OF HOLLY FOR INDICATING THAT THEY WANT. TO ACTUALLY. I DID NOT ACCESS TO. AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO LANCE TO LAUNCH ATTACKS. TOWARD IMMIGRANTS CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP IS NOT A LUXURY BUT A NECESSITY. TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS- PREVIOUS OBVIOUS BECAUSE MENTION THE GENERAL DEMOGRAPHICS OF IMMIGRANTS I WILL NOT GOING TO DETAILS. I'M MORE INTO THAT BUT I JUST LIKE TO GO MORE SPECIFIC IN REGARDS TO BACK UP. THE BACKUP POPULATION. AS MENTIONED MANY- FOLKS ARE OUT COULD BE. RECEIVING THAT BENEFIT THAT PROTECTION. THE RECENT REPORTER BY OUT MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE INDICATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND- I STUDENTS ACROSS THE NATION COULD BENEFIT OUT OF THAT. AND WHAT ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND I ACTUALLY CALLED CALIFORNIA THEIR HOME SO WE HAVE THE BIGGEST POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. GOING TO HAVE THAT PROTECTION AND GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR OKAY OUR- OR- HIGHER EDUCATION. ALSO DOCTOR RECIPIENTS ARE PARENTS TO SEVENTY THREE US BORN CHILDREN. AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS PAY ABOUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN FEDERAL TAXES AND ONE BILLION A STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. THEIR OWN I'M NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND HOMES- AND PAY APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION- IN IN MARCHES AND ABOUT NINETY MILLION IN RENTAL PAYMENTS EIGHT YEARS SO. AS MENTIONED DOCTOR RECIPIENTS ARE PART OF ALSO OUR OUR COMMUNITY. I'M AND THEREFORE ARE ARE THEY THE SUCCESS OF THE GOLDEN STATE A STACK TO DE COMICS OF SAYS NOT ONLY FROM DOCTOR RECIPIENTS BUT IT ANY. ANY IMMIGRANT. IN THE LAST BUDGET- CYCLE WE WAS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AS A STATE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- INVEST IN THE FUTURE BUT THEN ALSO WE- WE- WILL. WE PROVIDE SOME- SOME RESEARCH FOR WINNING THE RAINY DAY COMES AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. HAVING SAID THAT THERE WERE SOME MISSED A PATERNITY IS- AND ONE OF THOSE WAS IN REGARDS TO THEY THEY INVESTMENT TOWARDS EXPANDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT- CAL ATC. FRONT DOCUMENT TO WORKERS. IN ADDITION TO THAT EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR THE ELDERLY AS- I'LL AS IS BECAUSE PRIVATELY MENTION. IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN IN DAY STAY FOR TEN YEARS AND THEY HAVE INVESTED AND THEREFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN THEY BECOME ELDERLY- AND LASTLY GIVEN THAT WE HAD TO DOCK- SUPREME COURT HEARING COMING UP IN NOVEMBER TWELVE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE INVEST AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO PROTECT- THOSE. THOSE IMMIGRANTS. HAVING SAID THAT- THE CAL- THE TAX EXPANSION IS CRITICAL FOR US GIVEN THAT IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE AS WORKERS- AND WE KNOW OUR HOPE IS THAT WE REQUEST THAT. THEY WILL BE INCLUDED- AND IN ANY TYPE OF EXPANSION. I'M IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT THREE MILLION WORKERS WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT NEW NEW EXPANSION. HOWEVER UP CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES WILL NOT BE. WHEN I HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BENEFIT GIVEN THAT THEY- PAY OR IT- FATHER TAXES VIET ACTING NUMBERS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY NUMBER. THAT THE IRS GIVES TO THEM TO PAY THEIR TAXES YET THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING BACK IN RETURN. APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND ALSO I'M- OUR CHILDREN. UNDER THE AGE OF SIX- I WILL NOT BE RECEIVING THOSE THOSE BENEFITS. I'M OUR WORK OUR MEMBERS- JULY MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE HOSTILE WORKERS. OUR DAY LABORS ARE STREET VENDORS WE USUALLY WORK IN THE FORMAL INDUSTRY AND EVERY SINGLE DAY WE ARCH THEM TODAY AND FOR THEM TO FILE THEIR TAXES. BECAUSE AS WE SEE ME QUESTION FOR POTENTIALLY MOVING UP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. PAYING TAXES IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF- BILLS TO HAVING JUST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO MOST OF OUR MEMBERS ACTUALLY- FATHER TAXES- AND FOR US A SEIZURE BUT EQUITY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE PAYING THEIR TAXES AND IT'S A MATTER. OF THEM GETTING THEIR MONEY BACK- IN RETURN. BASED ON ON ON DATA AND REPORTERS AT THE DISASSEMBLY DEVELOP IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THEY STAY WOULD ONLY I SPENT ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY. TO PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO IF IMMIGRANTS ARE AND BILL IS IN DOLLARS WHY. WE NOW CAN I GIVE SIXTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. LASTLY ASIDE PERMEATES AT ONE OF THE OTHER KEY PRIORITIES MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. THE USA LABOR SENATE YOU SEE BERKELEY LABOR SENATE INDICATES THAT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIA'S. I BAR DUCKS HEALTHCARE MOST OF MOST OF THEM ARE UNDOCUMENTED. AND SO WE FEEL THAT. THE BUILDING INSTALL- BY SENATOR RUSSELL- AND ASK SOMEBODY- MEMBER ENSEMBLE THAT OUGHT TO BE EVASIVE BUT THEN ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCES. AND WE'RE CONFIDENT BASED ON ON CONVERSATION BY GOVERNOR NEEDS SOME AND SENATOR RUSSELL THAT HE WILL COMMIT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THE BUDGET AND HAVING TWO. GREAT CHAMPIONS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEES WE HOPE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL. WILL MOVE FOR WHAT. I'M AND. AND LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT I C. RELEASED IT THAT K. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO MOVE FORWARD DOES NOT DENOUNCE BEN AND OBVIOUSLY THERE I SAID IT'S A PENDING WAITING THAT PROVIDE A LINK IS THAT YOU'RE BITING EVE DHAKA IS- IS IT ELIMINATED WHICH COULD BE AS SOON AS JANUARY OR IN JUNE THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT IS IT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT POPULATION GIVEN THAT THEY ALREADY ARE IN THE PROFESSIONS ARE PAYING TAXES- AND LASTLY A KEY ASPECT OF A MINOR. WHO MAY HAVE GOT BACK UP AND NOW IT'S OVER EIGHTEEN THERE'S A KEY PROVISION UNDER FEDERAL LAW THAT SAID THAT ONCE YOU START ACCUMULATING UNLAWFUL PRESENCE DOCKING BAR YOU FROM IS STATING THE OBVIOUS THREE YEARS OR TEN YEARS DEPENDING ON YOUR SITUATION SO THAT IS CRITICAL FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO GOT BACK I WENT UNDER EIGHTEEN WON'T WON'T BE PENALIZED IN THE FUTURE MY DATE THREE AT TEN YEAR BAR. I'M LASTLY WHEN THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE YOU KNOW BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT WE SO WE HAVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PUBLISHING OF IMMIGRANTS- AT AND YET WE DON'T HAVE AN AGENCY- SECRETARY THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE A BOLD VISION FOR IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THAT SERVES ABOUT THREE POINT TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS US THERE'S ABOUT ONE TO ONE MILLION. VETERANS WHEN WE HAVE TEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS AND WHILE WE HAVE SOMEONE APPOINTED WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND APARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICE HAS A GREAT CHAMPIONS OUT WITHIN THAT DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE A SECRETARY NORTH AGENCY THAT WILL HELP THEM AND COMPLEMENT THEIR WORK- AND AGAIN I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO I APPRECIATE YOUR STAFFING YOU FOR BEING IN THIS HEARING. FOR I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING FULLER WE DON'T. THANK YOU. THAT. NO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. AND CERTAINLY- I HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SAY THERE ARE EVEN MORE WE CAN DO AS CALIFORNIA- I GUESS THE I WOULD SORT OF POSE THIS QUESTION- AND- WHO'S GONNA TRANSFER THAT BUT YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. AS WE ARE TRYING TO DO OUR EFFORTS IN THE STATE OF COURSE FOR SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TRYING TO OVERCOME THINGS ARE COMING DOWN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THERE ARE ELECTIONS COMING UP- THIS IS A- PUBLIC. SENATE HEARING SO THERE'S NO OPINION- AT THAT I'M EXPRESSING HERE ABOUT. WHAT SITES PEOPLE TAKE. ON THE ELECTION WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER THE HEARINGS OVER- BUT- WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT. YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF THEIR THINGS WE ARE GOING TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO TRY TO DO IT STATE BUT- WHAT KIND OF ISSUES DO YOU THINK NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. WHEN IT COMES TO ASIDE FROM ON DOING A LOT OF THE STUFF THEY WERE DOING THAT- THAT THAT YOU THINK ARE LIKE THE TOP PRIORITY BECAUSE YOU CAN SPEND ALL DAY TALKING ABOUT. IN TERMS OF. CHANGING. ON AND TERMS OF FEDERAL POLICY WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING AS WE GET CLOSER TO NOT ONLY PRIMARIES FOR PRESIDENT BUT ALSO FOR. BASICALLY ALL THE CONGRESS PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT VIEWS IN OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION- AND- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL. SO BUSH I KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEAVE AT TWELVE FORTY FIVE DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'D GIVE YOU A SHOT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE TO LEÓN ONLY IF YOU WANT TO. THANK YOU DODD DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES. OKAY SO I THINK AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF IF I WISH ONE THING IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE WHAT ACCULTURATION PROCESS IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE LIKE A SYSTEM THAT NAVIGATE IT TODAY MING CULTURE. I THINK AS AN IMMIGRANT IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES THAT'S THE MAJOR ISSUE IS THIS IS OUR CULTURE BE AREA THERE'S A STICK MODEST SO MUCH IN SOCIAL AND PRE AND POST TRAUMA AND LOST ALL THIS IS WE CARRY SO MUCH- LEVEL OF ISSUES TO BRING WITH OUR SELF YET. WE ARE ALSO EXPECTED JUST TO FIT THE CISCO SYSTEM OR BUSINESS ANY SECTORS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO ANY SECTOR STERN AND I STATE IT WAS PRESENTED EARLIER WHEN IS OF AFRICAN AND- IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE A LOT OF FAT CONTRIBUTION AT THE INTEGRATED PENETRATED WITH EVERY SECTOR HOWEVER BUT THE NEW ARRIVAL MAINLY THE CHILDREN WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT NAVIGATE. TO THE MAIN CULTURE AND ALSO- BRING GAINES OR TRYING TO LEARN EACH OTHER CULTURE AND THE RESPECT OF WHAT IS THE OTHERS PROSPECTIVE VERSUS JUST SPECIALLY RIGHT NOW THIS THE POLITICAL- CLIMB IT WOULDN'T ALLOW US TO BE WHO WE ARE AS A CULTURAL. IS LIKE TO BE AMERICAN IF NOT YOU DON'T FIT HERE THAT'S THE KIND OF ATTITUDE WE GETTING SO THE MOTHER THE CHILDREN GOING WITH THE MOST M. COMMUNITIES HAS- WHAT IS A GOOD JOB WE HAVE THAT INCIDENTS IMAGINE RARING HIS CHILDREN HOW YOU RESPOND HOME THE SURFACE STEP IN. THAT'S THE KIND OF HAVE REALLY DISSECT EACH ISSUES TO GET INVOLVED MAKE SURE IT'S MORE PREVENTIVE EDUCATIONAL VERSUS PRIMITIVE ANY SECTORS THE STAFF IS TAKEN AWAY WELL THAT'S THEIR JOB BUT HOW DO WE EXPLAIN TO THEM THIS IS HOW WE CULTURE PROSPECT IS NOT ABOUT- WHAT IS THAT NEGLECT OR ABUSE. THOSE ARE THE THINGS OF LITTLE THINGS MIGHT BE NOTHING BUT M. IS A LOT TO US BECAUSE THEY SAID EARLY SARAH DETAINEES ARRIVED WHEN THEY ARRIVE HERE A LITTLE FOOD MEANS A LOT TO THEM LISTEN I'VE BEEN HUNGRY. IT'S ASSISTS MALES BELONGINGNESS WE HAVE TO BE. IT WAS STRENGTHENED IDENTITY WITHOUT- SEPARATION THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING THANK YOU. AT LEAST FOR SO ALEX JULY SEEKING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY FOR NEXT YEAR'S STARTING ONE OF THEM IS HOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA LEADERS ENSURE THAT THEY CLOSE TO THREE MILLION LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS ARE READY TO BECOME CITIZENS BECOME CITIZENS FOR TO PULL TWO MAIN REASONS ONE IS IN REGARDS TO THE POLITICAL- REALITY ONCE YOU BECOME A CITIZEN YOU HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I'M SO THAT CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY BUT THEN TO ALSO RELATED TO THE BUDGET EVE FOLKS BECOME CITIZEN THEM THAT THE STATE WILL GET REIMBURSED REGARDS TO THE WHATEVER SERVICES THAT THEY THAT THEY CAN DO FOR US IS- WE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE CONVEYED IS A STRATEGY TO ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT MAYBE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIFTH WE OUGHT TO HAVE A GOAL OF NATURALIZING ONE MILLION- THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE. AND THAT CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE ACROSS THE STATE BUT THEN ALSO- ISOLATES OUR BUDGET THE SECOND ASPECT IS HOW YOU KNOW WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR- AND THE LIKE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO IMMIGRANT A SPECIFIC AREA OF WORK- BUT I THINK WE ALSO SEE HOW IS THAT WE CAN DO THAT LEVEL OF THE SAME LEVEL OF WORK THAT WE DO IN IN CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN. ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR GO ABROAD AND SO LIKE WE ARE DOING THIS GREAT WORKING WHEN I CHAMPION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALSO ELEVATE THAT THE SAME LEVEL OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THE TWO OF THEM ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THERE ACTUALLY FLEEING THOSE COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO HOW DO WE TIE THE TWO THINGS TO TOGETHER. TO THE BALLPARK BET THAT THAT THAT- SOME OF YOU HAVE I'M LASTLY AS AT LEAST FOR US IT'S LIKE HOW DO WE CREATE SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAT- OUR I SEEKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS OUR AGENCIES ARE INCLUSIVE THAT THERE IS A CO I COME DRIVEN DATA THAT WE CAN SHOW LIKE IF WE DO A THAT MEANS THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME EITHER A JOB WHAT LANGUAGE ACQUISITION. JEAN THERE'S MEANTIME WORK BEST WITHIN WITH EIGHT C. AND NOT SEE A GREAT A GREAT REST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. SERVICES TRYING TO INTEGRATE THEIR MODEL IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRACK. FROM A PROJECT WITH THE PROJECT MANAGER THAT DOWN TO LOOK AT THE WORK. THIS REPRESENTATION IS CRITICAL TO ALLOWING M. GUNS TO ACCESS THE RELIEF THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR AND ALSO TO CHALLENGE UNJUST POLICIES OR TO CHALLENGE- I'M JUST INTERPRETATIONS OF CURRENT AND IMMIGRATION LAWS. MISTER POWERS- WHAT'S THE TOTAL POPULATION IF YOU SENATE I MISSED OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN BOTH THE FEDERAL FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND OUR STATE SYSTEM. FEDERAL FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I DON'T HAVE THOSE FIGURES IN FRONT OF ME BUT IN OUR STATE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS ASSESSING EXACTLY HOW MANY UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO MECHANISM. FOR SCREENING ARE IN DOCUMENT- EXCUSE ME FOR SCREENING ARE FOSTER YOU REALLY COOL STATUS- WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH OTHER COUNTIES IN BASED ON ESTIMATES FROM OTHER COUNTIES WE- GUESS THAT THERE IS ABOUT- WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE IS ABOUT BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH. EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA- I KNOW THAT IN LA COUNTY ACCORDING TO MY COUNT WE HAVE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED ONGOING CASES THAT WE ESTIMATE THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED NEWMAN DOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH ENTERING THE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR. STATEWIDE STATEWIDE AND JUST TO GIVE ME A THE UNIVERSE BUT JUST YOU KNOW WHAT I WILL I WILL HOLD YOU TO THE NUMBER BUT JUST I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. THE NUMBER IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM.

AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WAS HIS FORMER STUDENT- ALTHOUGH THAT WASN'T THE ISSUE ALREADY SPOKE THAT TO HIM WITH HIM. THE OTHER ONE IS THAT WHEN HE WAS A TEACHER HE ALSO STAYED AFTERWARDS AND HAD THE KIDS RUN. AND HE HADN'T HAD TO GET M. CLEAR THEY RAN MARATHONS EVERY YEAR INCLUDING THE LA MARATHON. BUT HE COULDN'T GET THEM CLEARED. SO HE HAD TO ACCOMPANY EACH KID TO THE CLINIC TO SEE A DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET IN TO SEE A DOCTOR. AND HE WAS OUTRAGED SO I NEED THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

IT TOO ESPECIALLY WITH DH THE EIGHT I. PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO PROVIDERS ON HOW TO ADVISE THEIR FAMILIES TO SEEK COVERAGE- OKAY WHY LEGAL INFORMATION SOURCE EDUCATING PROVIDERS- WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN UP TO DATE ON THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS AND GUIDANCE ON ENROLLMENT- AND THAT'S CURRENTLY LACKING.

THANK YOU DEBORAH COLEMAN DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION ALSO IN THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND THE IMPACT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY IS FACING- RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING A DECREASE IN ATTENDANCE DUE TO THE IMMIGRATION. CLIMATES OF CHILDREN ATTENDING EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND ALSO OUR- EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS LACK THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. OZ'S TRUSTED GATEKEEPER TO GIVE- IMMIGRATION POLICY INFORMATION. TO THE PARENTS THAT THEY SERVE. I SHARE WITH YOU TWO RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER ONE IS SUPPORTING THE FUNDING. FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH IMMIGRANTS SERVING ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO WORK WITH FAMILIES. THE SECOND IS ABOUT FUNDING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE TRAINING FOR EARLY EDUCATORS SO THEY CAN BETTER SUPPORT- THE- IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO EXPERIENCED STRESS. AND UNEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND FOR THE WITNESSES. THE TIME KEEPER IS THERE TO HELP YOU FIRST LET. THANK YOU SENATOR IS AND THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROSE VENUE I GUESS AND I SERVE THE IMMIGRANT HEALTH ACCESS TASK FORCE OF LA CUNY. I WORKED AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. WE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE IMMIGRANT HOUSE ACCESS TASK FORCE. ASSISTANCE IN ENROLLMENT FOR MEDICAID EXPANSION FOR ALL KIDS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS ELEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN WERE ASSISTED AS PART OF THE ESPY SEVENTY FIVE EFFORT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SP SEVENTY FIVE ROLLOUT IT TOOK THREE CONTACTS IN ADDITION TO THE TWO NOTIFICATIONS FROM DH CS TO GET SOMEONE TO ACCEPT INFORMATION AROUND SP SEVENTY FIVE. A YEAR LATER INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SP SEVENTY FIVE IT TOOK TWICE AS MANY IF NOT MORE CONTACTS ON TOP OF THE DH CS NOTIFICATIONS.

HI LESLIE HI MY CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA TO THE QUESTION THAT THE LAST QUESTION YOU POSE TO THE PANEL I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THINGS- ONE IS THAT AS THERE ARE THERE'S A LITTLE POCKET IN THE CHILDREN'S BUREAU. OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING GOOD WORK AND WANTING TO HELP US SERVE FAMILIES BETTER- ONE COMES IN THE FORM OF FAMILY FIRST WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN ENTHUSIASTIC. ABOUT JUMPING INTO BUT IT'S A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED OR FUNDING THAT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES AND KEEP MORE CHILDREN AT HOME WE NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND THE SECOND RELATES TO FORI FUNDING FOR ATTORNEYS FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHICH OUR LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB OF QUICKLY ADOPTING NECESSARY BUDGET ITEM SO THAT WE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. BUT IMPLEMENTATION IS TO DATE NONEXISTENT- IS FIVE MONTHS AND WE HAVE YET TO HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DRIVE DOWN THOSE FUNDS SO WE ARE AT RISK OF LEAVING FEDERAL DOLLARS ON THE TABLE. AND ALL THOSE DOLLARS WILL HELP CHARLES LIMIT MYSELF ABOUT THAT PLEASE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HI I'M DANIELLE ONE DROVE WITH CHILDREN NOW- WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AN OBLIGATION TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR KIDS OF COLOR- AS WELL AS KIDS LIVING IN POVERTY AND IN MIXED STATUS FAMILIES- TO MAKE SURE THAT CAN GROW UP HEALTHY. AND READY FOR COLLEGE CAREER AND CIVIC LIFE- WE NEED TO ENSURE CULTURALLY COMPETENT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION FOR ALL STATE SERVICES THAT SUPPORT FAMILIES- AND SO THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES- WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SENSE. YOU KNOW THAT AND CHILDREN BEING IN LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS. LIVING IN COMPLEX FAMILY SITUATIONS IN HOMES WHERE ENGLISH IS NOT THE FIRST LANGUAGE UNEVEN HOMELESS CHILDREN. ARE AMONG THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO COUNT IN THE UPCOMING CENSUS- SO GIVEN THESE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WE WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE. OF THE STATE INSURANCE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION MATERIALS ADVERTISEMENTS MESSAGING AND TRAINING OF SENT CENSUS WORKERS- TO ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF COUNTING ALL YOUNG CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR SHAKE THAT NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING SENATOR MITCHELL'S. SENATE PAN AGAIN MY NAME IS JAMES MARMOT FIRST FIVE LA AND SO I'M ACTUALLY OCCUR TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP.

THE PEOPLE REFLECTED HERE ON THE PANELS AND I'M IN THE- AUDIENCE IS TO THINK ABOUT- INNOVATION LIKE MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIPS- WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY CREATIVE WAYS.

IF THAT CAN BE CHANGED AS POINT GUY BESIDES POINTING OUT THAT I WANTED TO. POINT OUT TO THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WHILE THERE YOU SOME REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS. A REFUGEE LEVELS THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO LOOK I'D INNOVATION US ORIGINALLY MENTION IN THAT CASE MANAGEMENT AREA SPECIFICALLY AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS. CHILDREN MOST OF THEM THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO NAVIGATION SERVICES THERE WHILE THERE IS SOME SORT OF INVESTMENT IN LEGAL SERVICES. I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO LOOK INTO THAT AND LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF. YOU ARE GATHERING STERN THERE COULD BE MORE REPRESENTATION OF. US TALKING ABOUT ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE THIS IS ONE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

A GOOD AFTERNOON CHELSEA WILK CONSTITUENT. NOT SURE OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS EXIST ALREADY. BUT I WONDERED IF- CALIFORNIA OR POLICY COULD BE DEVELOPED AROUND- CREATING- TREATIES WITH DIFFERENT. COUNTRY IS THAT A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS ARE MIGRATING FROM. TO CREATE SOME ECONOMIC SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING A LARGE ECONOMIC POWER. AND SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES. SO THAT THE IMMIGRANT PARENTS. ARE THEM MORE PROSPEROUS EITHER HERE IN THEIR- THEIR- COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. THEREBY IMPACTING IMMIGRANT CHILDREN I APPRECIATE YOU AND THAT IS AT STAKE CAN ENGAGE IN A TREATY BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE- ONE OF THE COUPLES OFFICES BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN WITH MEXICO IN THERE OTHERS THAT ARE GROWING. BUT. SAY IT AGAIN. NO NOT SISTER CITIES WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEYOND THAT BECAUSE THAT'S MORE CULTURAL BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE SEVERAL OFFICES THAT DO JUST THAT WE DON'T COLUMN TREATIES BECAUSE WE'RE A STATE BUT WE DO AN INTERVIEW CANADA MEXICO ELEMENT THERE ARE YES LET'S SEE I THINK IT'S WITH IN THE BIZ FED- GOBIZ GOLD THIS THANK YOU GOBIZ UNIT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WHERE WE- ARE EIGHT KNOWLEDGE JEAN. COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE TRADE WITH- AND REALLY TRYING TO EXPAND ON POLICIES TO HELP WITH IMPORT AND EXPORT WITHIN DIRECTLY THAN SAY A CALIFORNIA OKAY AND THEN THE LAST THE LAST PIECE I WANTED TO JUST THIS IS MORE OF A COMMENT OR QUESTION I WONDERED ALL THE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE BORDER WHERE THEY WERE JUST TAKEN THERE WAS NO WAY TO ATTACH THE CHILD TO THE PARENT. WHERE ARE THOSE CHILDREN JUST A QUESTION I WAS WONDERING YET THOSE ARE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS WE HAVE TO ASK ALL OF OUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS- BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE STILL BEING HELD IN AND AS WE ALL PAINFULLY SEEN THOSE OF US WHO VISITED- THE CAMPS AND WATCHED. ON THE NEWS THERE WAS NO PLAN. ADDITIONALLY FOR ANY KIND OF REUNIFICATION AND SO THERE WAS NO. SYSTEM PUT IN PLACE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS WHERE THEIR CHILDREN WERE WERE PANTS REMOVED I MEAN SO IT IT IS A TRAVESTY. YOU KNOW BEFORE RUNNING FOR OFFICE I RAN- I WORK DIRECTLY IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILD CARE FACILITY. THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN IT. IT IS OFFENSIVE BEYOND MEASURE IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS DONE WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OR QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF CHILDREN WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE- THE DECENCY OF THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY'RE LIVING. IT IS OFFENSIVE BEYOND BELIEF.

IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM SOMEHOW IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN EITHER- WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS WITH THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA TRYING TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SERVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED AND PARTICIPANTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE CAN SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET LEGISLATION TO HELP. I'M JUST GETTING THE MESSAGE MAY BE MORE MORE FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE OF WHAT.
