ALL RIGHT ITEM NUMBER THREE AB SEVEN HUNDRED IS. FOR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS IN THE PROPOSED MOCK UP OF AB SEVEN HUNDRED AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTION PROPOSED FOR THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS ON THE AMENDMENTS. AB SEVEN HUNDRED SIX TO PROTECT ACADEMIC FREEDOM BY ESTABLISHING A LIMITED VERY LIMITED SET OF EXEMPTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC RECORDS ARE ACT FOR RESEARCH RECORDS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. FIRST I BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS A CRITICAL TOOL THAT ALLOWS CALIFORNIANS TO HOLD THEIR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. THE AXE SERVES AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROVIDING PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF YOU UNIVERSITIES FUND OF OUR UNIVERSITIES FUNDING AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER IDEOLOGICALLY DIVERSE SPECIAL INTERESTS. FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES AND ALSO INDIVIDUALS ARE INCREASINGLY USING THE ACT TO DISRUPT RESEARCH A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THE ACT IS BEING USED AS AN INEXPENSIVE POLITICAL ADVOCACY TOOL TO HARASS RESEARCHERS EAVESDROP ON THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES AND DISCOURAGE RESEARCH ON HOT TOPICS WITH SOCIAL RELEVANCE. THESE RECORD REQUESTS ARE OFTEN DIRECTED TO RESEARCHERS WORKING ON AREAS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE LABOR IMMIGRATION RACE AND GENDER. THEY AFFECT RESEARCH RANGING FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS TO TAX POLICY AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. WELL THE PERSONAL IMPACT THESE REQUESTS HAVE ON RESEARCHERS IS UNFORTUNATE THE ULTIMATE PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON THE PUBLIC RESEARCH AT PUBLIC. RESEARCH AND UNIVERSITIES THEMSELVES. ULTIMATELY ABUSIVE REQUEST TO RESEARCHERS INTERFERE WITH THE CENTRAL TASK OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTIONACROSS CALIFORNIA'S WORLD CLASS PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. AB SEVEN HUNDRED PROVIDES FOR A VERY LIMITED SET OF EXEMPTIONS FROM THE ACT FOR RESEARCH RATCHET RECORDS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. WITH THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING TODAY THIS WOULD INCLUDE I'M PUBLISHED DATA DRAFT DOCUMENTS AND RESEARCH MESSAGE OF METHODS RESEARCH CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN PROFESSIONAL PEERS TRADE SECRETS AND INFORMATION THAT WOULD COMPROMISE. THE PRIVACY OF HUMAN RESEARCH SUBJECTS. IT IS NOT MY INTENT TO HELP HIDE OR CONCEAL IN ANY WAY ANY WRONG DOING GOING ON A PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WITH AB. SEVEN HUNDRED THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS MY OFFICE HAS BEEN MEETING WITH IN SEEKING FEEDBACK FROM THE ACLU AND THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS AN ANIMAL -- ON WELFARE ADVOCATES SINCE BEFORE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TO THE BILL GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT AB SEVEN HUNDRED WILL STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FOSTERING THE FIELD LEADING RESEARCH THAT CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ARE KNOWN. FOR WHILE MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE PUBLIC. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN HUNDRED IS CLAUDIA POLSKI ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR PROFESSOR OF LAW AND DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL. LAW CLINIC AT UC BERKELEY AND DONALD SMITH PROFESSOR WITH THE MICROBIOLOGY AN ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY TOXICOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT UC SANTA CRUZ. ALSO WITH ME IS JASON BARBERS WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS THE SPONSOR OF AB SEVEN HUNDRED I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PAUSE AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE GALLAGHER CHAO. CHIU [inaudible] GONZALEZ [inaudible] HOLDEN. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS [inaudible] REYES. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM RIGHT THE FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TODAY AS AN ISSUE EXPERT AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE THREE POINTS FIRST THE HARASSMENT OF ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS THROUGH PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS IT'S REAL AND IT'S PERVASIVE. BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS AT UCLA LAW PROFESSORS AT UC BERKELEY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHERS AT UC DAVIS AND ABORTION RESEARCHERS AT UCSF. HAVE ALL BEEN HARASSED BY EXPANSIVE AND INTRUSIVE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS FROM IDEOLOGICAL OPPONENTS OF THEIR RESEARCH. SMITH ALSO DETERS SCHOLARS FROM PURSUING CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS I RECENTLY HAD A UC BERKELEY SCHOLAR TELL ME. THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT ABANDONING RESEARCH ON TITLE NINE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE THE THOUGHT OF PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS SOUNDED QUOTE UNBEARABLY AWFUL. I'VE SPENT TWO YEARS RESEARCHING THIS PHENOMENON OF SCHOLAR HARASSMENT AND I'VE DOCUMENTED MANY CASES IN AN ARTICLE IN THE UCLA LAW REVIEW THAT'S AVAILABLE FREE ONLINE. SECOND THE SCHOLAR HARASSMENT PROBLEM IS FIXABLE. AB SEVEN HUNDRED IS A CAREFUL SOLUTIONS THAT I'VE ENDORSED ALONG WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ACADEMICS ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN EVERY ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. THE BILL DOES WHAT MANY STATE OPEN RECORDS LAWS ACTUALLY DID FROM THE BEGINNING BUT UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S DID NOT. IT PROTECTS AN INTELLECTUAL SPACE. THE PROFESSORS NEED TO REFINE THEIR IDEAS SUCH AS BY PRODUCING ROUGH DRAFTS OF ARTICLES. IT ALSO PROTECTS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL PEERS THROUGH THE FORMAL PEER REVIEW PROCESS BUT ALSO ALSO THROUGH MUCH LESS FORMAL EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH WHICH THEY TEST IDEAS. IF THESE CHANNELS CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO BE PRIVATE AND CANDID SPACES. RESEARCH COLLABORATION AND CANDOR DISAPPEAR AND THAT'S BAD FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS BAD FOR SOCIETY. THIS LEADS ME TO MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT. THE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS IN OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT HAVE PROVEN WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO PROTECT RESEARCH. THERE'S AN EXEMPTION FOR PRELIMINARY DRAFTS AND A CATCH ALL EXEMPTION BUT THEY BOTH CONVERGE IN A BALANCING TEST THAT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES AN INTENSIVE FACT SPECIFIC SOMETIMES DOCUMENTS SPECIFIC INQUIRY. INTO WHETHER IT IS FOR OR AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO RELEASE THAT PARTICULAR DOCUMENT AND THAT MEANS THAT RESEARCHERS ARE PULLED OUT OF THEIR LABS AND OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND INTO MULTI YEAR COURT BATTLES TO TRY TO PROTECT RESEARCH. YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS TODAY FROM DOCTOR SMITH. THIS WOULDN'T BE THE CASE IF WE HAD A BRIGHT LINE RULE AS TO WHICH TYPES OF RESEARCH LIMITED TYPES OF RESEARCH RECORDS ARE EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE. AND THESE CRITICISMS OF OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ARE NOT JUST MY OPINION. THERE THE OPINION OF THE CLIMATE SCIENCE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH DID A SURVEY OF EVERY STATE PUBLIC RECORDS LAW IN AMERICA. AND GAVE CALIFORNIA'S A LETTER GRADE OF C. FOR RESEARCHER PROTECTION. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IT SHOULD NOT HAVE THAT GREAT ON ITS TRANSCRIPT. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI SEVEN HUNDRED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE OKAY -- I'M DONALD SMITH AND I WAS A GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE HERE -- AND I TOO AM HERE'S A PRACTICES NOT AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE UC SYSTEM. I'M OVER CAREER SPENDING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE HELP DEVELOPING APPLY SCIENTIFIC METHODS TO IDENTIFY INFORMAL SOURCES OF THE TOXIC METAL LEAD AND WE'VE USE THAT METHOD AND IN CASES OF LET A LEAD POISONING CASES OF OF CHILDREN AND WILDLIFE. IN OUR WORK WITH ENDANGERED CALIFORNIA CONDORS SHOW THAT LEAD POISONING FROM INGESTION OF LET FRAGMENTS IN ANIMAL SHOT WOULD LEAD AMMUNITION WAS THE MAIN SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING. IT WAS PRECLUDING THE RECOVERY OF WILD CONDORS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS WORK PROVIDED IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON THE HARM OF LEAD AMMUNITION ON NON TARGET WILDLIFE AND IT SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF TO ASSEMBLY BILLS ULTIMATELY BANNED THE USE OF LEAD AMMUNITION. FOR HUNTING IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF OUR RESEARCH WE RECEIVED FIVE PUBLIC RECORD ACT REQUESTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION FOUNDATION. SEEKING IN SUMMARY ALL OF OUR WRITINGS CORRESPONDENCE AND ANALYTICAL DATA INCLUDING THE RAW DATA WAS RELATED TO MY RESEARCH ON LEAD SPENDING A SIX YEAR PERIOD. ONE SCENE IN GOAL OF THE GUN RIGHTS REQUESTING GROUP WAS TO TARNISH OUR REPUTATIONS AND THIS IS MADE APPARENT UNAFFILIATED PRO HUNTING WEBSITE. THAT ATTEMPTED TO DISCREDIT OUR PEER REVIEWED PUBLISHED FINDINGS. WHILE WE START TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUEST WE INITIALLY RESPONDED THAT WE WOULD NOT RELEASE THE DATING CORRESPONDENCE RELATED TO OUR ON PUBLISHED RESEARCH. THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE DISASSOCIATION FOUNDATION SUED US IN SUPERIOR COURT AND THE COURT RULED IN OUR FAVOR BY NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE REQUEST. IN PART BECAUSE THE PUBLIC RECORD ACT IS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORD ACTED SO UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT RESEARCH MATERIAL IS AND IS NOT COVERED BY EXISTING EXEMPTIONS I PERSONALLY HAVE SPENT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED HOURS. SEARCHING DOCUMENTS ELECTRONIC FILES FOR POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE TURTLES. MEETING WITH UNIVERSITY COUNCIL STAFF PREPARING SITTING FOR DEPOSITIONS COURT HEARINGS ETCETERA. IN OUR EFFORTS TO PROVIDE RESPONSIVE MATERIALS FOR THE REQUEST OUR ON GOING. THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED MY ABILITY TO FULFILL MY RESEARCH AND TEACHING DUTIES AS THE UC FACULTY. IS INTERFERED BY ABILITY TO PURSUE RESEARCH FUNDING TO CONDUCT RESEARCH TO ANALYZE DATA PUBLISHED BY RESEARCH FINDINGS. ENDED IS CHILLED SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES ARE POTENTIAL COLLEAGUES AND OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS IS BECAUSE OF MY AND OR THEIR FEAR PROVOKING MORE HARASSING PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUESTS. SO I SUPPORT AB SEVEN HUNDRED I THINK IT STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND PRIVACY FOR RESEARCH. I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT EVERYONE WILL BE BETTER SERVED WITH MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT RESEARCH INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. THANK YOU X. WITH US WITH. JASON BARBERS FOR THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS WERE THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND JUST HERE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL GO FORWARD TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION [inaudible] CONSIDER TO MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE PROUD CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. FIRST I'D LIKE STATE THAT OUR POSITION ON THIS BILLS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHORS WALLS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS BILL. AS THE AUTHOR NOTED THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT. TO ACCESS RECORDS IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT IN FACT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT IT'S IN TRYING -- TO STATE'S CONSTITUTION. FOR JOURNALISTS WATCHDOG GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS DOING THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS A CRUCIAL AN INVALUABLE TOOL. AGENCIES USE THAT VIEW THE TASK OF RESPONDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST AS A NUISANCE RATHER THAN AS PART OF THEIR IMPORTANT. RATHER THAN AS PART OF THEIR MISSION TO SERVE THE PUBLIC I REGULARLY RECEIVE PHONE CALLS. FROM JOURNALISTS. WHO HAVE RECEIVED RESPONSES FROM AGENCIES THAT REFUSE TO PROVIDE RECORDS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY RESPONSIVE? TOO MANY AGENCIES. WILL FIND ANY EXCUSE NOT TO DISCLOSE RECORDS AND IT'S FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT THE REALITY THAT ALLEGED ABUSE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS COMMITTED JUST AS MUCH AND LIKELY MORE. BY AGENCIES THEM BY REQUEST STIRS THAT WE BELIEVE NEW EXEMPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO CONFORM TO SITUATIONS THAT HAVE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED WHEN THE LAW WAS ENACTED. AND NOWHERE IS THIS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IN THE CATCH ALL EXEMPTION IN LIGHT OF THIS THE DETERMINATION THAT SHOULD BE MADE ANY TIME IN NEW EXEMPTION TO DISCLOSURE IS CONSIDERED. IS WHETHER SPECIFIC PROBLEM EXISTS IN WHICH THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. IS SERVED BY NON DISCLOSURE IS AND IS NOT ALREADY COVERED BY AN EXISTING EXEMPTION ONLY ONCE THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE SHOULD A NEW EXEMPTION BE CONSIDERED AND THEN THE NEW EXEMPTION SHOULD BE VERY NARROWLY TAILORED. UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVEN HUNDRED DOES NOT YET PASSED THE THRESHOLDS EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN -- ACCEPTED TODAY WE BELIEVE THE EXEMPTION PROVISIONS THE BILL ARE STILL TOO BROAD AND WOULD ALLOW CIRCUMSTANCES OF RESEARCHER MISCONDUCT. AN UNDUE INFLUENCE OVER RESEARCH TO BE CONCEALED. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THAT -- THE APPROACH OF THE BILL OF EXEMPTING THESE CATEGORIES AND THEN BRINGING BACK IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD NOT BE EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE. IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS GENERAL STRUCTURE OF HAVING RECORDS BE TO SCHOOLS WILL IT EXCEPT IN VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES. TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T CONDONE HARASSMENT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL AND WE CERTAINLY WANT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR CAP -- PRIVATE COUNTERPARTS. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT GOING DOWN THE ROAD OF SHIELDING RECORDS FROM DISCLOSURE OVER CONCERNED THAT SOMEONE WILL BE CRITICIZES VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE. AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT FOR EVERY STORY OF A RESEARCHER WHO HAS HAD A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. QUOTE UNQUOTE WEAPONIZED AGAINST THEM THERE'S ALSO A STORY OF PUBLIC RECORDS BEING USED. TO TO UNCOVER. US STORIES OF MISCONDUCT IMPROPER OVERSIGHT BY UNIVERSITIES AND UNDUE INFLUENCE IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE EXEMPTION THIS BILL COULD ALSO BE EXPLOITED BY THE VERY INTEREST GROUPS AT WHICH THE BILL IS AIMED AT ALLOWING THEM TO EXERT GREATER CONTROL OVER RESEARCH PROCESS SEES WITHOUT FEAR OF EXPOSURE. TO BE SURE THE TASK OF CRAFTING EXEMPTION THAT'S NARROW ENOUGH TO PRODUCE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHOR WHILE STILL NOT HARMING THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW IS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK. WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE MADE BEEN MADE SO FAR WE BELIEVE NEED MORE WORK IS NEEDED WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON AMENDMENTS TO NARROW DOWN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH A SPLIT. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FROM AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR TENET TO NARROW THE BILL WE NEVER THE REMAINED. CLOSED THE URINALYSIS DESCRIBES THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO MODERNIZE -- THE CPR A IF IF THIS IS MODERNIZATION I THINK WE FIND OURSELVES ON AS I HAVING TO CHARACTERIZE OUR STUFF IS OLD FASHIONED. ON THIS ISSUE -- THE TESTIMONY TODAY DESCRIBED EXISTING LAW IS INSUFFICIENT -- BECAUSE IT RELIES ON A CASE BY CASE BALANCING TEST FOR EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE WE WE DON'T CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT RECORDS WE LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR EXCLUSION IN EACH PARTICULAR CASE WE THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH NOT THE WRONG APPROACH AND IT SERVED US WELL -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE IMPORTANT TOOL -- OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN TOOL. FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND DEMOCRACY YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT TOOL AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T THINK ARE USING IT APPROPRIATELY. WITHOUT ALSO TAKING IT AWAY FROM THOSE WHO USE IT FOR IMPORTANT PURPOSES AND FOR THAT REASON WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. HELLO -- MY NAME IS HEATHER RALLY I'M A VETERINARIAN AND I SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS PETA. AND ARE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OF WHOM LIVE IN CALIFORNIA -- TO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED HAVE THE ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN HUNDRED WE APPRECIATE THE OFFICE SMILING THIS -- TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BUT I STILL WANT THOSE CONCERNS BE ON THE RECORD HERE TODAY -- OUR CONCERN IS THAT AB SEVEN HUNDRED WOULD ADD BROAD NEW EXEMPTIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. TO CONCEAL WHAT IS HAPPENING TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS USED IN EXPERIMENTS IN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE NEARLY ALWAYS FUNDED WITH FEDERAL AND STATE TAX DOLLARS. AS THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION MAKES CLEAR THE PEPLE CALIFORNIA HAVE A RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. AND THIS INCLUDES A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ANIMALS IN LABORATORIES IN OUR NAME AND WITH OUR MONEY -- EVIDENCE OBTAINED VIA OPEN RECORDS LAWS HAS LED TO SOME OF P. DOES MOST IMPACTFUL EFFORTS TO EXPOSE ANIMAL ABUSE AND VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND LABORATORIES. THIS INCLUDES HIDEOUSLY CRUEL AND SCIENTIFICALLY WORTHLESS CCAD EXPERIMENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON AND BABY MONKEY EXPERIMENTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. BOTH OF THESE LABORATORIES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED AFTER THESE INVESTIGATIONS. RIGHT NOW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS WHICH HAS ONE OF THE WORST TRACK RECORDS IN THE COUNTRY FOR VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL ANIMAL WELFARE ACT. IS FIGHTING PIZZA TO KEEP THE PUBLIC FROM SEEING VIDEO TAPES OF BABY MONKEYS WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR MOTHERS TO BE INTENTIONALLY FRIGHTENED. THE LAB GAG BILL -- AS AB SEVEN HUNDRED HAS ALSO BEEN CALLED BECOME TO BE CALLED -- WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DAVIS TO USE AT SOME OF THESE X. NEW EXEMPTIONS TO KEEP THESE RECORDS SECRET AND THE PUBLIC WOULD NEVER LEARN THE FULL EXTENT OF ABUSE -- AND SHAME FOR THE SHAMEFUL ABUSE BEING CARRIED OUT IN THESE MONKEYS. AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR ENGAGING WITH THE OPPOSITION IN MAKING AN ATTEMPT -- TO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS IN THE CURRENT BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION WE'RE DONE TAKING TESTIMONIES WILL TAKE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. I AM DONE WITH ME I'M A CITIZEN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TO OPPOSE THE LAMP GAG BILL AB SEVEN HUNDRED TO THE EXTENT. IT MAKE YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THAT'S ALSO. IS THAT -- WE CAN SET. A KATHY GARCIA I'M A REGISTERED NURSE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA I'M A MEMBER OF A PIZZA. AND I ALSO OPPOSE AB SEVEN HUNDRED THANK YOU. MY NAME IS JOE BONNER ON A CALIFORNIA LICENSE VETERINARY TECHNICIAN A GRADUATE OF UC DAVIS A RETIREE OF UC DAVIS AND I HAVE DEALT FIRST HAND WITH THESE ANIMALS. IN THE THIRD AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL TESTS BUT THIS POINT. BUT JUST THE IDENTIFICATION IS GREAT AND TO SAY THAT YOU OPPOSE THANK YOU I OPPOSE THANK YOU. I MAY HARMS FROM EL DORADO COUNTY AND I OPPOSE THIS AND I'VE BEEN DOING IT THANK YOU THIRTY YEARS COMING AGAINST NEXT PLEASE. HI JUDY MAN CREW SO FOUNDER PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION. AND I'M ALSO HERE FOR THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US THANK YOU THANK YOU. LESLEY GOLDBERG COMPASSIONATE BAY ELSA RIDEAU AND I OPPOSE THANK YOU. MICHAEL GOLDBERG ALSO RIDEAU ON BEHALF OF DIRECT ACTION EVERYWHERE AND IT'S THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS WE OPPOSE. GOOD MORNING JOHN PERRY JAN CARMICHAEL I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ANIMALS THAT DON'T HAVE A VOICE AND I OPPOSE A. B.. SEVEN HUNDRED THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE IF YOU WANT EXPRESS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WELL. I HAVE A GARAGE TO LINK FROM DISTRICTS SIX ALSO POSING AB SEVEN HUNDRED THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SO HERE'S WHAT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH A FIRST OF ALL IT'S IT'S A LITTLE HARD. TO THINK OF SOMEONE WHO IS EXERCISING A RIGHT THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM UNDER LAW AS HARASSMENT AND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT FEELS HARASSING BUT THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF A HARD. STEP TO TAKE [inaudible] AND EVERY TIME WE TOUCH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THERE'S A TWO EDGED SWORD THAT GOES ON HERE. SO THE NOTION OF TRYING TO VERY NARROWLY TAILOR SOMETHING. TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. IN TERM THE BEGINNINGS OF RESEARCH. A IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR THAT THE ACADEMICS TO DO THE KINDS OF PROBING THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN THAT CONTEXT. IS THERE'S A SOMETHING THERE THAT THAT I THINK IS IS OF A WORTHWHILE INQUIRY. BUT THE AND I THINK THAT I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE AND I THINK WE HAPPY TO MOVE THIS OUT BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE KEEPING I THINK PRETTY CLOSE WATCH. ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS. THAT. IF THIS AT ALL HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO REACH IN AND UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT ARE GOING ON IN GENERAL CATEGORIES. FOR UNDERSTANDS. REALLY WHAT'S. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT RESEARCH THESE ARE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT WHERE. CLOSING THE DOOR TO AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE TO TREAD VERY CAREFULLY WHEN WE TRY TO DO THAT SO THE YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THE EVERY PUBLIC AGENCY DEALS WITH THIS I THINK WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY WE CONSTANTLY HEAR TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S A VERY. PROMINENT CASE WHERE THERE'S A LOT ABOUT DISCLOSURE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH BEING NEGLECTED AND AND ABUSE AND AND OVER WRITTEN AND SO WITH. AS WE TRY THESE DISTINCTIONS. AT AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING WITH ON THIS TO TRY AND MAKE THIS IS NARROWLY CRAFTED AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT WE ARE NOT. ALLOWING. ANY PUBLIC AGENCY UNIVERSITIES ARE OTHERS TO HAVE ANY UNDUE EXCUSE ULTIMATELY TO HIDE THINGS THAT THEY KNOW WOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL. JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE CONTROVERSY ME HIDING JUST A HIGH. AS OPPOSED TO DISCLOSING ELEMENTS OF THAT RESEARCH THAT MAY BE PREJUDICIAL TO GETTING THAT RESEARCH DONE. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO ATTEMPT HERE I DON'T. KNOW THAT WE NECESSARILY THREADED IT CORRECTLY BUT I THINK WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO GO DAY IN INTO THAT DIRECTION. BUT THAT THE OF THE OPPOSITION BRINGS GOOD POINTS IN WHAT WE'RE CHANGING. CHANGING SLIGHTLY THE PHILOSOPHY WHERE WE HAD TRIED TO MAKE EVERYTHING DISCLOSE A BALL. OTHER THAN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THERE IS A BIRD TO THAT ON ANY AGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF THESE I'VE BEEN IN AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT THESE. THERE IS A BURDEN TO THAT THAT'S BUILT INTO THE FACT THAT WE'RE A PUBLIC AGENCY [inaudible] AND THAT. HAS TO BE THE CASE. SO AS WE TRY AND NARROWLY TAILOR THIS AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I WOULD HOPE. THAT IF YOU CAN'T. THREAD THAT NEEDLE OR DEPENDING ON HOW THIS. WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AS IT MOVES THROUGH WE MAY BE WANTING TO SEE THIS AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AGREE? WITH HOW YOU THROW THAT NEEDLE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE NOT. SHUTTING DOWN THAT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT. TO KNOW EITHER IN BROADER CATEGORIES OR SORT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S GOOD INFORMATION AND I JUST A WARNING TO ALL OF US THAT I THINK TO MYSELF AS WELL SINCE HER RECOMMENDING THAT WE MOVE THIS BILL HERE TODAY. THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO BE DILIGENT THAT IF WE DO PASS SOMETHING AND IT GOES TO THE LEGISLATURE DOES GET SIDE BY THE GOVERNOR. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TESTING IT AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IT GETS USED AND AND ACT QUICKLY IF WE FEEL THAT THIS IS UNNECESSARILY CLOSING OFF ACCESS TO TO PUBLIC INFORMATION. SO WITH THAT MISTER KALRA LIMóN SERVICE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- FOR FOR YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE I THINK -- THE THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL AND I THINK YOU IN YOUR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORK ON THIS. HAS BEEN EXCELLENT. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY ALL THE OPPOSITION IS. IT WOULD A GROUP A POSITIVE IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE AUTHOR EVEN IF THEY COULD PRINCIPALLY CAN'T BE THERE AND I THINK THAT -- YOUR YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU IN A GOOD WAY IN TERMS OF BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION IN GENERAL TO TRY TO RESOLVE ISSUES. AND I THINK THAT'S EXEMPLIFIED BY QUITE A FEW PRETTY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS -- AT THIS STAGE AND OBVIOUSLY THIS BILLS ON THE CONTINUE GOING FORWARD AND I I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY SAY THAT FOR EVERY AUTHOR I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE. THE FALL IN THE CAN THE THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION BUT IN THIS CASE I WILL BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE IF IT'S POSSIBLE. AND A I THINK THE INCREASE WORTHWHILE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE I THINK THAT YOU YOU AND THE OPPOSITE ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF IT IS. AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH THEIR THIS BUILDING WE DO HAVE PRINCIPLE OBJECTIONS OF THINGS THAT WE DO. AND AND WE HAVE TO BE CUT WITH THAT AT TIMES BUT I THINK GIVEN. THE AMOUNT OF IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND I KNOW THE THE THE CHAIR CERTAINLY IS IS RIGHTFULLY PROTECTIVE OF IT. AND I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO MONITOR CLOSELY AND I KNOW THAT THE THE AUTHOR. WILL. BE SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK REALLY HARD WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND A WAY. TO AMELIORATE AS MANY CONCERNS OF HOPEFULLY ALL THE CONCERNS BUT I THINK ON PRINCIPLE MAYBE NOT. BE ABLE TO AND THAT'S A MILLION ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK THAT TO THE CHAIRS POINT. THERE IS SOMETHING HERE THAT I THINK A LEAD SINGER LEAD CIVIL REQUIRES THAT INQUIRY. AND I THINK THAT -- AND SO FOR THE FACT ALONE I'M GRATEFUL THAT THIS BILL IS HERE SO THAT WE THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE BOTH INTENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS AND SO -- HYPE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I THINK THAT IF IT COMES BACK TO US BASED UPON SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS -- THAT -- WILL PEOPLE LOOKING VERY CLOSE AND EVEN AS IT GOES FOR THE FOR I THINK ALL OF US KNOW LOOK VERY CLOSELY TO SEE HOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS BEEN FURTHER ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE ADDRESS A LOT OF THEM ALREADY -- IT BUT THE AMENDMENTS TODAY SUCH WANTED THANK YOU AND I THINK THE OPPOSITION AS WELL FOR YOUR VERY CLEAR. ABOUT RESPECTFUL -- POINTS THAT WERE MADE I THINK THEY ARE THEY'RE ALL OF HER THE POINTS AS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR. AND I I THINK THAT IT DEMONSTRATES SOMETIMES A DIFFICULT WORK THAT WE DO HERE -- IN IN IN TRYING. TO DEAL WITH REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAW BUT UNDERSTANDING THE PRE IT'S A BOLD. NEED FOR THE LAW TO BE THERE. JUST WANT. TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS IN. SUPPORT OF THE AUTHOR -- AND AND THE WAY THAT SHE APPROACHES BILLS WHICH I THINK IS DIFFICULT TO DEAL BUT I THINK THAT YOU DON'T WELL. THANK YOU MS REST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT I THINK WHEN I SAW THE ACLU AND PETER AGAINST THE BILL -- WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS AN EXEMPTION TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT I KNEW WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE? BUT I ALSO KNEW WHO THE AUTHOR WAS AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU HAVE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR -- I IT'S A TOUGH. ONE BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO HAVE TO PROTECT -- THE RESEARCHERS AND AT OUR UNIVERSITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH THE RESEARCH BECAUSE IN THE END. THE PUBLIC BENEFITS SO DOES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE WITH THIS NEW EXEMPTION -- AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE QUESTION WILL CONTINUE TO ASK AS IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS. IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO BE SERVED BY THIS EXEMPTION AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT WILL BE AS NARROWLY CRAFTED AS POSSIBLE. AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS THAT. IF IT ISN'T. THEY WILL BRING IT BACK AND IF IT STILL ISN'T. THEN THERE WILL BE A REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR TO WITHDRAW IT -- I I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT -- IF IT IS IF IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. TO TO VOTE NO ON THE FLOOR WE'LL RESERVE THE RIGHT -- BUT IT'S CLEAR. BECAUSE OF THE PLAYERS HERE THAT THIS IS ONE THAT WE WANT TO WATCH AND AND IF IT CAN BE IF THE NEEDLE CAN BE THREATENED. IT WILL BE I'M SURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE SERVER NOTING. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM THE RESEARCHERS IS COMPELLING AND IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CPR A CAN AND HAS BEEN USED AND WEAPONIZED BY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STIFLE DEBATE ON ISSUES -- BUT THAT IS ALSO TRUE FOR A LOT OF FIELDS OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF RESEARCH AND SO I'M WONDERING WHY A FOR ALL OF KNOWLEDGE IN WITH THIS IS A PROBLEM. WHY WERE NOT APPROACHING IT WITH A SOLUTIONS TO THE CPR A RATHER THAN A NARROW CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION FOR JUST -- ONE CATEGORY OF OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEING -- THIS BEING A TARGET -- WELL. OUR AYE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING WHY IT'S NOT A BROADER BILL WITH LARGER EXEMPTIONS OR THAT THERE'S MORE AREAS WHY ARE WE TARGETING THE KIND OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT'S RESULTED IN THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM EXISTS NOT JUST FOR RESEARCHERS BUT ALSO FOR OTHER. CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION WHERE A GROUP THAT WANTS TO STIFLE DEBATE ON AN ISSUE OF WEAPONIZED AS THE CPR A TO TRY AND AND ACCOMPLISH THAT SO WHY NOT GO AFTER THAT BEHAVIOR. INSTEAD OF CREATING A AN OUTRIGHT EXEMPTION FOR JUST ONE CLASS OF INFORMATION. I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SEE KIND OF WHAT THAT WOULD. WITH A BILL WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW A WE WE WERE BROUGHT A PROBLEM. I'M HAVING TO DO WITH THE VERY BEGINNINGS OF RESEARCH WITH THE SCIENTIST FEELING THEY COULDN'T HAVE THE THE BACK AND FORTH THAT THEY NEEDED TO HAVE TO EVEN SORT OF BEGIN. THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND WE ARE ALSO VERY MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE DIFFERENT GROUPS SO AGAIN WE ARE TRYING TO TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE OF PRESERVING THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION THAT LEGALLY THEY'RE ENTITLED TO KNOW AND I BELIEVE MORALLY THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO KNOW BUT ALSO -- TO NOT YOU KNOW TO TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM RESEARCHERS OF HAVING THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST BEING USED TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN'T. EVEN BEGIN THAT RESEARCH SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE -- AND I GUESS I I DON'T KNOW AND IF YOU HAD OTHER LANGUAGE THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT BUT I'M. NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THAT THE WOULD LOOK LIKE OKAY WELL CERTAINLY COMPLEX PROBLEM BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY BLUNT TOOL IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT MORE NARROWLY TARGETED THAT KIND OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. YEAH IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO HEAR THEM WOULD LOVE TO I LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND YOU KNOW HEAR MORE OF WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE ALL PUT MY THINKING CAP ON THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ISRAEL AS A SECOND ROOM IS GONZALEZ MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO THIS IS HOW I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD LEGISLATOR -- SUMMER FRIEDMAN IS YOU KNOW LAST WEEK WE HAVE. A BILL UP HERE IN THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE THEY HERE TO SUPPORT IT. YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL THIS WEEK THAT NOW THEY'RE OPPOSED TO IT AND SO -- ANYWAYS YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- I THINK THAT -- THE ISSUE HERE FOR ME WAS I THINK THE POINT WAS MADE VERY WELL BY THE GOOD DOCTOR HERE FOR WHY THIS BILL SHOULD BE OPPOSED. BECAUSE IN FACT YOU ARE DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY. IN FACT THESE STUDIES ARE BEING RELIED UPON. TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT AFFECTS. THE ENTIRE PUBLIC -- THESE THESE FINDINGS -- ARE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT AVENUES THAT AFFECT THE PUBLIC AND SO. I DON'T WANT. TO I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDER SCORE THIS ENOUGH LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. ABOUT HOW THESE STUDIES ARE BEING CONDUCTED ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S BEHIND THE FINDINGS WHAT WHAT CORRESPONDENCE. WAS TAKING PLACE -- BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE A STAKE. IN THE ISSUE -- AND THOUGH. I COULD MAYBE SEE THE ISSUE OF WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE RESEARCH IT IT BECOMES HARASSING AND YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE RESEARCH -- THEN MAYBE WHAT SHOULD BE DONE THERE IS TO AT LEAST ALLOW THE RESEARCH TO BE COMPLETED AND THEN SOMEONE CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE REQUEST TO FIND OUT. ABOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS AFTER -- THE RESEARCH DOCUMENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BUT NOT TO HAVE A COMPLETE SHIELD -- YOU KNOW OR VERY BROAD SHIELD AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM OR EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A PRETTY BROAD SHIELD. AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT WAS MADE. IS IT THIS IS OFTEN USED BY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES -- AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT HAVE A GREAT RECORD. OF YOU KNOW BASICALLY TRYING TO PUSH OFF PUBLIC SCRUTINY. YOU KNOW AS AS WE ARE LOOKING INTO SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THEY'RE USING PUBLIC FUNDING. SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THEY'VE HOARDED MONEY -- IN THE OFFICE OF THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW THE THEY SEEM TO CONTINUALLY WANT. TO NOT BE OPEN TO PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND HERE NOW ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE THEY WANT INTO A SHIELD. ESSENTIALLY. FOR THEIR PURPOSES FOR US TO NOT LOOK INTO AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO NOT LOOK INTO -- HOW THEY'RE CONDUCTING SOME OF THEIR RESEARCH -- AND THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU'RE ON WE WANT TO ENSURE AND ESPECIALLY WHERE PUBLIC DOLLARS. ARE BEING USE THAT YES WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE BEING USED AND HOW THAT RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED -- SO. FOR ME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS REALLY NARROW THIS MUCH MORE THAN WHAT WE'VE GOT TODAY -- AND AND REALLY TRY TO TELL AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT'S KIND OF OUR JOB -- YOU KNOW THAT IF IF THERE IS SOME WAY TO HELP PROTECT AGAINST THE HARASSMENT THAT IS IMPEDING AND STOP BEING GOOD RESEARCH FROM GOING FORWARD. MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT WITHOUT TAKING AWAY THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW ULTIMATELY -- HOW THAT RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AND TO BE ABLE TO SCRUTINIZE IT YOU KNOW? THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL TO IS NOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FREE FROM SCRUTINY -- AND THAT'S KIND OF ALWAYS BEEN THE HISTORY OF OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS THAT YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND SOMEONE DOWN THE ROAD SAYS WELL HEY. YOU MISSED THIS. AND AND WE IMPROVE BECAUSE OF THAT PUBLIC SCRUTINY -- SO PUBLIC SCRUTINY IS A GOOD THING NOT A BAD THING AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I I HAVE TO OPPOSE AND I WOULD ASK THAT WE WOULD HOLD THIS IN COMMITTEE -- TO REALLY WORK ON THAT AND FINDING THAT REALLY RIGHT BALLOTS. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AT C. NINE DID JUST BRIEFLY MS FREEMAN I AM I TOO HAD SOME OF THE ISSUES -- WHEN I FIRST READ THIS THAT AS REYES BY -- MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE IN FACT IN TO IT. IT'S ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY PARTIALLY IN CONFLICT WITH THE BILL. DEPENDING. WITH A BILL THAT I HAVE -- HOWEVER I HAVE WORKED WITH YOU ON A NUMBER OF BILLS IN THE PAST I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT WORKING WITH OPPONENTS -- AND COMING TO SOME SOLUTION THIS IS IT THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE -- AND CERTAINLY THAT THE VIEW BEHIND IT I THINK IS GOOD BUT BUT AS WITH ANYTHING THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE AB. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE EXPERIENCE I HAVE WORKING WITH YOU -- BUT I DO THINK LIKE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SOME RESERVE BUT IT AT LEAST YOU KNOW SOME LEVEL OF HEARTBURN OVER IS THIS IS THIS MISS FORD SO WELL FORTY WORKING WITH WITH EVERYBODY TO KIND OF CLARIFY SOME OF THAT. SO WITH THAT -- CENA MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE -- YEAH THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND ALL OF THE OPINIONS -- FROM THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL -- AS WELL I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE BILL DID NOT COME TO US FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S IT CAME FROM THE SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES. WHO FELT THAT THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE LAUNCHING RESEARCH -- BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RECORDS REQUEST WAS BEING USED -- AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE METHODS THAT WERE USED IN RESEARCH WHAT WAS DONE ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCLOSED BOWL AND STILL IS UNDER THE BILL. WE BELIEVE THE THE BILL IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH YOUR BILL -- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT HELPS ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CONCERNS FROM PIZZA AND SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS -- AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY FINE NEEDLE AND WHEN WE HEAR YOU -- UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS FROM OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TELL US THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO RESEARCH THAT THEIR COLLEAGUES A PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES ARE ABLE TO DO. IN SOME CASES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS ARE BEING WEAPONIZED THROUGH PROCESS ITSELF AND THROUGH GETTING INFORMATION THAT PUTS THEIR OWN SAFETY SOMETIMES IN DANGER. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO DISCUSS AND TO SEE IF WE CAN HELP ALLEVIATE AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ATTEMPTING TO DO AND I KNOW IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW IS SO IMPORTANT. BUT THERE'S ALSO PUBLIC BENEFIT TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ALLOW RESEARCH TO MOVE FORWARD EVEN WITH THE PUBLIC. YOU KNOW GETTING TO UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THOSE DETAILS AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE AND IF I END UP WITH A BILL THAT CAN'T BE SUPPORTED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I KNOW IT'S A BILL THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO -- BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN SO MANY OF THE CUT MY COLLEAGUES TO SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS. SO -- I AM COULDN'T GONNA I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK THIS BILL IS GOING TO TAKE EXTRA WORK THIS IS A BILL THAT IS NOT AN EASY BILL AND NOT AN EASY FIX I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STOP WHO GAVE US. YOU KNOW AMAZINGLY THOUGHT FULL -- LANGUAGE AND WAYS OF OF REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS THIS AND WORK COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T WANT TO HARM. THE RIGHTS OF NEWSPAPERS TO KNOW TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR UNIVERSITIES TO HIDE -- ANY ON MISS DOINGS THAT THEY MIGHT DO OR THEIR PROFESSORS MIGHT DO WE UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO CONCERT ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE HAVE A A REAL -- YOU KNOW -- THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN RESEARCH IS GOING TO TO BECOME IT IN ALL TO HAPPEN AND AND HOUSE A LOT OF THAT RESEARCH IS DONE SO WE THINK THAT THERE. IS A SWEET SPOT THAT WE CAN FIND. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON AND WHEN MR STONE SAID THAT HE IS YOU KNOW WOULD PULL THIS BULL BILL BACK INTO THIS COMMITTEE IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL WE GOT THERE. I FIND THAT COMFORTING MYSELF BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE MY NAME AND BE BEHIND SOMETHING THAT THAT DOES THE KIND OF HARM THAT I THINK THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE WORRIED THAT IT WOULD DO. SO I WOULD ASK COMMITTEE STAFF PLEASE KEEP AN EYE AS BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS AND IF YOU FEEL THAT IT NEEDS TO COME BACK HERE BY ALL MEANS I WOULD NOT OBJECT TO HAVING IT COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR ANOTHER HEARING CHEST.

ARE YOU READY TO GO [inaudible] ABOUT. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND BEFORE THE AUTHOR EVEN SITS DOWN WHY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THIS BILL IT IS SIMPLE IT PASSED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THIS YEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL GIVE IT A SECOND LOOK. IT BASICALLY IN SHORES -- THAT EMPLOYERS CANNOT HOLD ON TO THE DOCUMENTS OF A WORKER AS A WAY. TO TO CONTROL -- CONTROL THEM IN THEIR WORKPLACE SO RIGHT NOWONE OF THE EASIEST WAYS. TO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING I GUESS THE WORKPLACE IS THERE SOMETHING CALLED DOCUMENT SERVITUDE AND THAT'S WHEN -- THE EMPLOYER WAIT WITHOUT THE WITHOUT RIGHTS TAKES TAKES THE VISA PASSPORT -- OUR DOCUMENTATION OF THE WORKER WHICH PROVIDES A MISS SITUATION TO BECOME MORE VULNERABLE -- AND DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FREELY AROUND OUR OUR BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT IT WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES UNDERSTAND. THEIR RIGHTS -- TO LEAVE A WORKPLACE AND TO TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN DOCUMENTS I RESPECTFULLY IT'S SPONSORED BY THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- AND WE HAVE A WITNESS HERE TODAY FROM THE DA'S OFFICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU THEIR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS MARTIN DOYLE I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE SEX CRIMES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING DIVISION OF THE SEND YOU A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I'M HERE ON THE OFF ON BEHALF OF MY BOSS NUMBER SEVEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO. AFTER I VOTE ON A. B. FIVE EIGHT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE MICROPHONE SORRY THANKS ONLY MAKE SURE YOU GET PICKED UP FOR THE RECORD. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WOULD BE A TOOL FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND CITY ATTORNEYS TO COMBAT AND SCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS WOULD SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM WITHHOLDING IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS. THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS DOES A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THAT STATE AND FEDERAL LAW IN THIS AREA. EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE WITHHOLD WOULD PROHIBIT WITHHOLDING OF IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS TO FURTHER VIOLATION OF STATE LAW. WELL WE ALREADY HAVE A LABOR TRAFFICKING FELONY FOR SOMEBODY WHO DEPRIVE SOMEONE OF THEIR PERSONAL LIBERTY TO OBTAIN FORCED LABOR. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A MISDEMEANOR FOR WITHHOLDING DOCUMENTS DISCOURAGE SOMEONE. FROM EXERCISING ANY OF THEIR LABOR AN EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. IT WOULD ALSO INFORM EMPLOYEES MANY OF WHOM COME FROM PLACES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE SUCH RIGHTS -- OF THEIR RIGHTS WHEN THEY WORK IN CALIFORNIA. AS A PROSECUTOR I OFTEN FIND THAT VICTIMS ARE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND THEY'RE AFRAID OF AUTHORITIES. THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS MADE STRIDES IN THIS AREA -- AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF BRAMBLE HERE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND EDUCATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL PROMOTES CALIFORNIA VALUES WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS DEEPENING AGNESE WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GINGER SHOP CALIFORNIA AGAINST SLAVERY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RATHER WALKING AROUND THE THE BARRIER HERE AND SITTING DOWN AND ALSO DO IT FROM RIGHT HERE I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY QUICK -- BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FOR OF YOUR FEDERATION OPPOSITION ON ONE PERHAPS SEEMINGLY MINOR BUT IMPORTANT POINT IN THAT IS THE REQUIREMENT -- THAT THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE WITH ONE OF THE RIGHTS ENUMERATED IN THERE WOULD BE THE RIGHT TO NOT BE. DOES NOT TO LIVE IN A PLACE DESIGNATED BY THE EMPLOYER. THAT'S GONNA BE PROBLEMATIC IN A LOT OF OUR CULTURAL OCCUPATIONS PARTICULARLY INVOLVING ANIMALS. WHERE YOU HAVE DAIRY OPERATIONS EGG PRODUCTION OPERATIONS WHERE THE HANDS IN THE COW IS NEED TO BE ATTENDED TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY? THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE LIVING ON THAT PROPERTY. AND ONE OF THE OCCUPATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THAT JOB SHOULD BE THE ABILITY TO LIVE ON THAT PROPERTY AND HOUSING PROVIDED. BY THE FARM OPERATORS SO I'D BE INTERESTED IF THE AUTHOR WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SORT THAT OUT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT -- BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE OPPOSED BUT OPEN TO TALKING AND PLEASED THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES TOGETHER -- SO I MEMBER GONZALEZ I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AS I DID LAST YEAR WHEN YOU HAD THE BILL -- BEFORE BEFORE US -- FOR THE REASONS THAT YOU KIND OF ARE LAID OUT I MEAN THIS THIS IS HOUSTON. AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- AND HOLDING UP SOMEONE'S IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS ALSO MIR'S FEDERAL LAW. WHICH REQUIRES THIS AS WELL -- I JUST THINK. ONE IS THE ISSUE ABOUT A BY FARM BUREAU BUT ALSO LIKE AND I COULD SEE IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE SELF STORAGE. UNITS WHERE YOU HAVE THE MANAGERS OF APARTMENTS YEAH IN MATTERS OF APARTMENTS ACCEPTED TO WEAR MAY WORK ON THAT SO THAT -- OBVIOUSLY IN THOSE CASES SOMEONE DOES NEED TO LIVE THERE. IN ORDER TO DO THE JOB -- AND AND THEN I KNOW THERE IS ALSO CONCERN LIKE HEY IF. YOU KNOW IF THE DOCUMENT ISN'T GIVEN EVEN TO SOMEONE WHO'S A CITIZEN -- YOU KNOW WORKING FOR THE PERSON DOES THAT SUBJECT AND THEN TO LIKE PAGO LAWSUITS AND THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT'S RAISED IN. BY SOME -- OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE -- SOMEONE WHO IS TRYING TO YOU KNOW ABIDE BY THE LAW BUT MAYBE JUST DOESN'T DO ONE THING AND THEN IS SUBJECTED. TO YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW A LAWSUIT THAT COULD COST THEM YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY SO. IT IT IS OF COURSE AND PUBLIC SAFETY COULD NOT THE LABOR CODE SO -- I THINK WE SHOULD BE OKAY ON THAT -- IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LABOR CODE NOW OKAY -- SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO INSURE THAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS. ABSOLUTELY FACTUAL BUT I IT IS A PUBLIC SAFETY -- ISSUE OKAY I'M IF IF NOT WE CAN WORK ON IT RIGHT HERE ON THIS -- THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT. WHERE YOU LIVE -- IS AN IMPORTANT -- ONE BECAUSE IT IS SO SENSITIVE WE SEE SO MANY TIMES -- AND AM NOT EMPLOYERS I GUESS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAYING THEIR WORKERS BUT AT FOLKS WHO ARE FORESEEN LIVING SITUATIONS SO I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND SOME OTHERS. AND I I APPRECIATE -- THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS OF THIS TO TO GET SOME VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON A CLEAR INDICATION WHEN IT'S PART OF A A JOB DESCRIPTION -- HOWEVER I I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE DON'T WANT TO COMPLETELY TAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE THAT THAT'S AN OBVIOUS -- RIGHT WE THINK OF IT AS AN OBVIOUS RIGHT YET YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE AT YOUR JOB IF IT'S NOT A CONDITION OF THE JOB -- BUT THAT'S EIGHT AN INDICATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THAT WE SEE OFTEN IN MY COMMUNITY A LOT AND SO -- WE JUST ARE TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE OF THAT BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE FARM BUREAU -- AND OTHERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT -- IT BEING TOO BROAD. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COVER. RIGHT SEEING NONE AT THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ AND YEAH THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT. THAT ISSUE ABOUT WORKPLACE BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON IT. WITH THAT IT IS IN THE LABOR CODE I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW IN MY MIND IT WAS OF ALL GET THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I'M SORRY I JUST REALIZED AS I SAID THAT. WE'LL FIX IT. YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I CHAO CHIU GONZALEZ I CONSULT AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA KILEY. NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I OBERNOLTE PETRIE-NORRIS REYES [inaudible] YES I ALL RIGHT NEEDS ONE MORE SO AND PUT THAT ONE ON CALL AS WELL. FIFTY I KNOW MR GREY'S RUNNING LATE COULD SOMEONE REACH OUT HIS OFFICE FIND OUT KIND OF WHAT HIS. ETA IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT THIS RACE. MOVED ITEM NUMBER SIX AB. ELEVEN TWENTY THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY PRESENT YOU A AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH ENSURES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND HIS OFFICE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS. PROP SIXTY FIVE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES THAT A BUSINESS EXPOSES CONSUMERS TO CHEMICALS. LISTED AS CARCINOGENS OR PRODUCTIVE OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS MUST FIRST PROVIDE CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNING. CURRENTLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FORCES PROP SIXTY FIVE TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC'S EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS AND FOOD. NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS INFANT FORMULA FURNITURE AND A HOST OF OTHER CONSUMER GOODS AND PRODUCTS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT PRIVATE ENFORCERS ARE DEFENDANTS REPORTED ANY. PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS TO THE ATTORNEY CSUS. IS ON AWARE OF PENDING APPEALS IN THE COURTS FORTUNATELY. OR UNFORTUNATELY -- A DO -- HOUSE THE OPINION. OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THEY WANT THEIR INPUT BUT IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOESN'T KNOW THAT THERE IS AN APPEAL PENDING OFTENTIMES IT ISN'T UNTIL THE REQUESTED TO PROVIDE THIS. INFORMATION AND WE RUN THE RISK OF SETTING PRECEDENT -- THE COULD BE JEFF DAMAGING TO THE AND TO MAKE. IT COULD BE DAMAGING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MUDDY THE BERNARDO THE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARIO DIBERNARDO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY OPPOSITE R.. THIS ERA WHO IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS. IMPORTANT BILL IT'S A SIMPLE BILL IT REQUIRES OUT LITIGANTS WHO FILE AN APPEAL IN A PROP SIXTY FIVE CASE TO NOTIFY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THEY ARE DOING THAT -- SO THAT THE AG CAN MONITOR THESE CASES IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC -- CURRENT REQUIREMENTS IMPROPER -- SIXTY FIVE PROVIDE SEVERAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ON THE AG BUT AT THE TRIAL LEVEL THERE'S A PRE COMPLAINT NOTIFICATION THERE'S A COMPLAINT NOTIFICATION. AND THEN THERE'S A NOTIFICATION THE AG'S OFFICE ONE OF SETTLEMENTS FILED ALSO THAT THE AG COULD MONITOR THESE CASES. IN SOME CASES -- PINE ON WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF IS BRINGING UP A CLAIM WITH MERIT AND WHETHER OR SETTLEMENT SERVES THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THERE'S NOT SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE APPELLATE PROCESS WE DO OUR BEST TO TRACK THESE CASES BUT THERE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES WERE CASES HAVE FALLEN UNDER THE RADAR. AND AFTER THE FACT WHEN A COURT OPINIONS ISSUED WE FIND OUT THAT THE COURT -- ESTABLISHED A RULE THAT IS COUNTER THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND NOT AN WE THEN HAVE TO LATER OR AFTER THAT -- FILE FOR D. PUBLICATION SO IT'S ADDITIONAL WORK FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WE GOT WE GOT THE D. PUBLICATION IN THE LAST TWO TIMES THAT THIS HAPPENED WHAT WE'RE ASKING HERE IN THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE NOTICE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO THAT IF APPROPRIATE A HE CAN FILE A AN AMICUS BRIEF IN THE COURT -- TO TO PROVIDE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE SO THAT THE COURT CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE LITIGANTS HAVE TO GIVE A PELLET NOTICE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THIS IS -- FOR OF A FEW EXAMPLES ARE THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS LAWS THE UNFAIR COMPETITION AND FALSE CLAIMS AND SEE CA. SO THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR THIS AGAIN A SIMPLE BILL IMPORTANT BILL AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VELMA HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SPORTS. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS GALLAGHER. US SO FIRST YOU GOT A GREAT WITNESS THERE WE WENT TO COLLEGE TOGETHER -- SO IT'S GOOD IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THERE MARIO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN COLLEGE THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE THE INTENT BEHIND PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE WAS A GOOD. ONE OF WANTING TO HAVE CONSUMERS KNOW. OF THE POTENTIAL OF HARMFUL CANCER CAUSING -- YORKERS CARCINOGENS IN IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY MIGHT USE -- BUT I MEAN I THINK I'M FORTUNATE LIKE THE LEGACY OF SIXTY FIVE NOW IS. IS ALMOST LIKE NOTICE OVERLOAD AND NECK HERE AGAIN AS ANOTHER NOTICE -- BILL I MEAN I YOU KNOW AS I THINK IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER INTO OTHER COMMITTEE JUST SAID YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU SEE THE SIGN. AND YOU ALMOST IGNORE THE SIDE NOW BECAUSE THE SIGNS EVERYWHERE. AND IT'S BEEN APPLIED TO PRODUCTS. I THINK IN. IT YOU KNOW IT'S IS IT HAS BEEN EXPANDED SO MUCH THAT APPLIES TO PRODUCTS THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE -- THIS REQUIREMENT -- WHERE I MEAN YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE LIKE A HUNDRED GALLONS OF THIS THING A DAY? YOU KNOW FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS FOR IT TO EVER YOU HAVE A POINT 5% CHANCE OF INCREASING CANCER -- AND I'LL GET JUST ONE QUICK EXAMPLE I KNOW IT'S ANECDOTAL BUT I REPRESENT A A BUSINESS THAT THEY'VE THEY MAKE ORGANIC PRUNE JUICE -- AND NOT ONLY ARE THE BENEFITS OF JEWS YOU KNOW I THINK VERY MUCH APPRECIATED BY OUR AGING POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT ALSO ORGANIC YOU KNOW AND THAT AND THEN AND THE NEED TO HAVE. YOU KNOW PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED ORGANICALLY AND PEOPLE WANT THAT THE MARKET. BUT IN THE PRODUCTION OF THAT ORGANIC PRUNE JUICE OR SOME SORT OF ELEMENT THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY -- YOU KNOW THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE -- REMIND ME THE NAME WHO WHO WHO WHO WHO THE TERM CASIO WE HAVE YEAH THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL HAS DETERMINED IS. POTENTIALLY CARCINOGENESIS AND SO THEY GET SUED. RIGHT AND ARE FACING A LAWSUIT WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE ARE GONNA END UP PAYING. THE MONEY OUT AND ALL THAT DOES IS KEEP A GOOD PRODUCT. FROM BEING AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- AND I MEAN I THINK THE EVIDENCE BEARS THAT OUT WE WE NOW HAVE SEEN THAT THE LEGACY OF PROP SIXTY FIVE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW PRIVATE THE CIVIL THAT THE CIVIL PENALTIES PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE AMOUNTS AWARDED FOR ATTORNEYS FEES COSTS. FOR THE FOR THE THREE MILLION IN PENALTIES COLLECTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE FOR EXAMPLE. OVER FOURTEEN POINT FIVE EIGHT MILLION AN ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS WERE AWARDED. ALONG WITH TWO POINT EIGHT FOUR MILLION AND OTHER PENALTIES. OVER 71% OF ALL AWARDS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WE'RE FOR ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. FOR THE PERIOD OF TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE PRIVATE SETTLEMENT ACTIONS RESULTED IN ROUGHLY SIXTEEN MILLION CIVIL PENALTIES. THE PENALTY AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR VIOLATING. THIRTY MILLION IN OTHER WORDS AND A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION. IN ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS -- SO I MEAN LOOK AT THIS. YOU KNOW THAT THE EVIDENCE HERE. TO ME SEE IS LIKE THIS IS MORE BENEFITING TRIAL ATTORNEYS. I'M MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE -- THEY ALREADY SEEM TO GET A WHOLE LOT OF BENEFIT OUT OF PROP SIXTY FIVE I REALLY DON'T SEE ANY NEED TO GIVE. THEM ADDITIONAL BUT BENEFIT BY I DON'T KNOW SOMEHOW GETTING DOJ INVOLVED ON APPEALS -- THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE NOTICE OF ANYWAY -- AND IF THEY WHEN AND QUITE HONESTLY I THINK THIS MY LAST THIS WILL BE MY LAST POINT IS DOJ HAS A LOT OF THINGS AND HE'S A FOCUS ON GETTING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF FELONS AND OTHER PROHIBITED PERSONS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM -- WERE TASKING THEM WITH COMING UP REGULATIONS FOR PRIVACY -- THAT'S GONNA TAKE UP A LOT OF THEIR TIME AND ENERGY THAT I THINK MOST CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS -- OTHER WEEK RIGHT WAITING BACK QUITE A BIT OFF THEIR TOPIC OF THE THE POINT BEING THERE'S SOME REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR THE DOJ AND I DON'T THINK ADDING THEM. ATTY MORE PROP SIXTY FIVE CASES TO THEIR DOCKET IS REALLY THE PRIORITY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW AS AS A LEGISLATURE SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE STATISTICS I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL THIS IS IS NOTICE THERE'S AN APPEAL AND THE NOTICE GOES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- I THINK WHETHER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A LOT OF THINGS TO DEAL WITH THAT LITTLE BIT OF THINGS TO DEAL WITH. I WOULD LIKE MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. AND I'D LIKE FOR HIM TO HAVE. NOTICE OF ANY APPEAL THAT HAS GONE UP SO THAT HE CAN THEN MAKE THAT DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE'S GOING. TO FILE THE A MAKERS PREFER NOT. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. A FURTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE VISITORS TO MAKE LOVE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THE QUESTION IS DO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER.

FOR FIFTY FIVE COULD WE LET MEMBERS KNOW THAT. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THE END. COME BACK. FOR COMPLETING HEARING BUSINESS. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB. FOR FIFTY FIVE VIOLENCE IS A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AN ESTIMATED 23% OF ADULT WOMEN AND ACTIVE SEVERE PHYSICAL INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE WITHIN THEIR LIFETIME. IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN HIGHER. AT THE SAME TIME TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF EVERYDAY LIFE. INTERNET CONNECTED LOCK SPEAKERS THERMOSTATS LIGHTS AND CAMERAS THAT BEEN MARKETED AS THE NEWEST CONVENIENCES THESE DEVICES ARE TYPICALLY POSITIONED AS HELPFUL LIFE COMPANIONS INCLUDING WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT WORK. OR ON VACATION AND WANTS REMOTELY SUPERVISE THEIR HOMES. DOMESTIC ABUSE VICTIMS THEIR LAWYERS SHELTER WORKERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE NOW DESCRIBING HOW MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING AN ALARMING NEW TOOL FOR OF USERS. ABUSERS ARE NOW USING APPS ON THEIR SMARTPHONES WHICH ARE CONNECTED TO THESE INTERNET ENABLED DEVICES TO REMOTELY CONTROL EVERYDAY OBJECTS IN THE HOME. THESE DEVICES ARE SOMETIMES USED TO WATCH AND LISTEN OTHER TIMES TO SCARE OR CHAU POWER. EVEN AFTER A PARTNER HAS LEFT THE HOME DEVICES OFFICE DEVICES OFTEN STAY AND CONTINUE TO BE USED AS A MEANS FOR HARASSMENT MONITORING REVENGE. AND CONTROL. UNDER CURRENT LAW IN SECTION SIXTY THREE TWENTY OF THE FAMILY CO THE COURT MAY ISSUE AN EX PARTE ORDER ENJOINING A PARTY FROM TAKING A VARIETY OF ACTIONS AGAINST THE PETITIONER INCLUDING THE LASTING ATTACKING STRIKING STOCKING THREATENING. SEXUALLY ASSAULTING BATTERING CREDIBLY IMPERSONATING FALSELY PERSON EATING HARASSING TELEPHONE IN DESTROYING PERSONAL PROPERTY CONTACTING COMING WITHIN A SPECIFIED DISTANCE OF OR DISTURBING THE PEACE UP. AB FORTY FIVE WITHOUT REMOTELY CONTROLLING ANY CONNECTED DEVICE IS THE HOME OF THE OTHER PARTY TO THE LIST OF ACTIONS THAT PARTY COULD BE ENJOINED FROM TAKING. IT WILL TRY TO DIGITAL SECURITY THE VICTIMS PARTICULARLY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF THEIR ABUSER TO CONTROL CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE. AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARE -- LAWS KEEP PACE WITH THE CHANGES VICTIMS OF CRIMES LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING AND HARASSMENT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FEAR BEING TORMENTED ON A REGULAR BASIS THE DEVICES THEY HAVE COME TO RELY ON IN THE DAY TO DAY ROUTINES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- I HAVE A WITNESS WITH ME THEY'VE BEEN SENT OUT WHERE MY JOB WITH THE WHERE'S ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU CHRIS WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING THIS CHEN MEMBERS VINCE OR AT MADRE WITH THAT CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THE FAMILY LAW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ONE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THIS IS A REAL AND RISING PROBLEM AND FOR THAT WORK THAT ARE LARGER SAYING AND FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS COMES UP SO I WILL FIRST ONE THANK YOU FOR BEING A BILL IT'S IMPORTANT -- IT DOES BRING UP AN ISSUE THAT I A HAVE IN GENERAL WITH -- NOT ONLY FAMILY CODE BUT THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT AND THAT'S GIVEN -- A LOT OF THE RHETORIC. BOTH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND WITHIN THE STATE HOUSE -- TARGETING IMMIGRANTS AND DISCOURAGING IMMIGRANTS FROM SINKING CRITICAL LEGAL PROTECTIONS. AT IT AND KIND OF CONFLATING -- THE RIGHTS OF OF IMMIGRANT VICTIMS WITH. NOW I WOULD LIKE. AMNESTY -- SO WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT INSURERS -- THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE WHERE AND THAT THE THE FAMILY CODE IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT IN PARTICULAR APPLIES TO ALL IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS SO. I AM GOING TO MOVE THE BILL WITH AMENDMENTS -- TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND ALL ALL JUST READ YOU QUICKLY WHAT THOSE ARE SO I'D LIKE THESE PUT INTO THE BILL. AND THAT'S THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS IN THE PLAYERS AS FOLLOWS THAT THE POLITICAL CLIMATE RESULTING FROM FEDERAL POLICY AND READ RHETORIC TARGETING IMMIGRANTS HAS DISCOURAGED IMMIGRANTS FROM SEEKING CRITICAL LEGAL PROTECTIONS. FOR FEAR OF IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES STARTING THEM OR THEIR FAMILIES. THAT THE LEGAL PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT ALL RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THREATENS THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE OFTEN NECESSARY TO PROTECT VICTIMS FROM THEIR ABUSERS REGARDLESS OF THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF THE VICTIM OR THE ABUSER. AND THE D. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT LIKE ALL THE FAMILY CODE HAS ALWAYS APPLY TO ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND CONTINUES TO DO SO. SO WITH THAT AMENDMENT -- I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND AND MOVE THE BILL WITH A PROPOSED AMENDMENT. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND HAVE MISTER CHAIR I I'M SORRY I THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I DON'T I'M NOT GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A POLITICAL FOOTBALL -- I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT. I'M NOT ASKING FIX AT THAT MOMENT I MASS ONE THERE'S A MOTION WITH AND AMEND THERE'S AN EMOTION SO THE MOTION RIGHT NOW THAT WAS PROPOSED. IS TO PASS AS AMENDED ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE ANALYSES. AND THEN SOME AMERICAN SALAS IS ADDING AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS OF THIS IS TO PASS AS AMENDED INCLUDING THAT AMENDMENT. THAT'S THE MOTION ON THE TABLE IS THERE A SECOND MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE IS NOW A SECOND. I MEAN WHAT WHAT IS YOUR SO WE HAVE NOT OCEAN I'M NOT PROPOSING THAT THEY CAN'T BE AMENDED -- BUT I THINK WE DO HAVE SOME RULES ON WHETHER NOT SOMETHING AS A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT OR A HOSTILE AMENDMENT THERE ARE NO RULES HE'S DISTINGUISHING AMENDMENTS THERE IS.

AND HOPEFULLY. FINISH UP OUR VOTING FOR THE DAY. MISTER GREGG FLOORS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BY TO START -- BY COMMITTING TO TAKE A MINOR CLARIFYING AMENDMENT. TO CONFORM SECTION. SIX ZERO THREE THREE WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THE WITH THE DEAD SO I CLARIFIED THAT STATE BAR MAY COLLECT VOLUNTARY AND MANDATORY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THAT PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO PERSONS OF LIMITED MEANS. THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR IDENTIFYING THIS NEED FOR CLARIFICATION. LAST YEAR AS MANY OF YOUR WHERE MISTER CHAIRMAN I PURSUED LEGISLATION PARTNERSHIP. WITH YOU TO ENCOURAGE CURRENTLY TUR TURNED IS TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL PRO BONO HOURS BY AUTHORIZING PRO **** TO COUNT TOWARDS AND SHELLY. THAT EFFORT TO NOT ALTERNATELY REACH THE FINISH LINE SO I'M BACK THIS YEAR WITH A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT REFORM TO BOOST FUNDING TO LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. LAW AUTHORIZES FORTY DOLLARS PER YEAR SURCHARGE TO BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE ANNUAL LICENSE FEE FOR ATTORNEYS. WITH THIS FUNDING DEDICATED TO NONPROFIT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS. THIS CONTRIBUTIONS CURRENTLY VOLUNTARY AND ATTORNEYS HAVE THE OPTION OF OPTING OUT. AB TEN SIXTY MAKE THIS CONTRIBUTION MANDATORY FOR ALL ATTORNEYS. CALIFORNIA'S LONG RECOGNIZE THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WORK OF LEGAL. AID ORGANIZATIONS AS PURSUED A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO GENERATE FUNDING. TO SUPPORT THESE GROUPS. RECENT STATE BUDGETS OF ADULT HAVE DEVOTED AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION PER YEAR TO LEGAL AID BUT THE SAME TIME FEDERAL FUNDING HAS BEEN JEOPARDIZED TO THE WHITE HOUSE HAS PROPOSED. TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. THE REALITY IS THAT THE DEMAND FOR LEGAL AID SIGNIFICANTLY OUTSTRIPS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE RESOURCES. IN CALIFORNIA THERE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS FOR EVERYONE LEGAL AID ATTORNEY AND 86% OF CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY LOW INCOME AMERICANS RECEIVE LITTLE. TO NO HELP. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS TO VOLUNTARY OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTRACT ATTORNEYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO LEGAL AID. ONLY ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT OF ATTORNEYS PARTICIPATE IN THE JUSTICE GAP FUND WHILE OUT OF THE FORTY DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION WHEN THEY RENEW THEIR LICENSE. BY MAKING THIS CONTRIBUTION MANDATORY AB TEN SIXTY WILL GENERATE BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR MILLION -- FOR PER YEAR FOR LEGAL AID. IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA LAGS FAR BEHIND SUPPORT OF LEGAL SERVICES. FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS STATES LIKE TEXAS MINNESOTA. AND MISSOURI HAVE ALL HAD MANDATORY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ILLEGAL AID AND THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ALL HIGHER THAN THE FORTY DOLLARS. THE NEW FUNDING CREATE BABY TEN SIXTIES MEDLEY MODEST BUT IT WILL PROVIDE A CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE LEGAL AID OF TIME THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. FISCAL UNCERTAINTY. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS I CAN BET THAT NEARLY EVERY ONE OF OUR DISTRICT OFFICES HAS HAD SOME POINT. NEEDED TO TURN TO LEGAL AID TO ASSESS TO CONSTITUENT CASE WORK. WITH THAT MIND MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION AYE VOTE -- TODAY. THANK YOU. FIRST WITH THE SWISS. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LAUREN KLEIN I AM THE DIRECTING ATTORNEY AT THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE A STATEWIDE MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION FOR CIVIL LEGAL AID NONPROFITS. OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN EVERY COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE. AS I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE YOU WILL BE PROVIDED AN ATTORNEY IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE IN A CRIMINAL CASE BUT THE SAME IS NOT TRUE IN CIVIL COURT. SO WHETHER YOU ARE FACING LOSING YOUR HOME LOSING YOUR CHILDREN. FIGHTING TO MAINTAIN YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR SAFETY IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO HIRE A LAWYER YOU WILL BE FORCED TO NAVIGATE A COMPLEX AND INTIMIDATING JUSTICE SYSTEM ALONE. AND ON REPRESENTED. IT HAS BEEN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON REPRESENTED YOU OUT ARE YOU ARE AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE WHAT RESULTS IS NOT A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE FOR ALL BUT RATHER A SYSTEM OF JUSTICE FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY MENTIONED THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROBLEM IS ENORMOUS. THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION FOUNDED THAT 71% OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES WILL EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEM IN A GIVEN YEAR. AND 86% OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL RECEIVE AN ADEQUATE FOR NO LEGAL HELP. HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR EVERYONE LEGAL AID LAWYER THERE IS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED LOW INCOME PEOPLE. LEGAL AID LAWYERS ARE VERY RESOURCEFUL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE CAN CARRY THAT KIND OF A CASELOAD. LEGAL AID STEPS IN TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES AND REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT BUT WE NEED MORE FUNDING. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NINETY SEVEN LEGALLY NONPROFITS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ELEVEN OF THE LARGEST AND MOST FAR REACHING OF THOSE ARE ALSO FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION. MOST ORGANIZATIONS THOUGH COBBLE TOGETHER A WIDE VARIETY OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES AND STILL STRUGGLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITY IT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THIS MORNING IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE SINGLE LARGEST FUNDER OF LEGAL AID. IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION FUNDING MANY ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT OR THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT. THIS IS VERY RELEVANT BECAUSE FEDERAL FUNDING IS BOTH THREATENED AND IT IS FUNCTIONALLY LIMITED. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GREAT MENTIONED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID IS AT RISK. FROM THREATS TO ZERO FIND LSE TO OTHER BUDGET CUTS TWO SENSES THREE ALLOCATION TO SEQUESTRATION WE BOTH POTENTIALLY FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN FEDERAL FUNDING. THE FUNDING THAT DOES MAKE IT TO CALIFORNIA IS LIMITED AND HOW IT CAN BE YOU STE. EVERY FUNDING SOURCE COMES WITH ITS OWN RESTRICTIONS BUT LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION FUNDING THE LARGEST FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE. DOES NOT ALLOW ITS USE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. SO TO REITERATE ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE USED TO SERVE A SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT PART OF OUR POPULATION. THIS IS WHY IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND FIND WAYS TO FILL THE GAPS. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT LEGISLATORS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY ARE SEEKING WAYS TO FIND THOSE ALTERNATE FUNDING SOURCES AND AB. TEN SIXTY IS ONE OF THOSE WAYS. THE LEGISLATURE CREATED OPT IN AN OPT OUT CONTRIBUTIONS ON ATTORNEY DO STATEMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND TEN RESPECTIVELY. AND CURRENTLY THAT BRINGS ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO LEGAL AID EVERY YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE STATE BAR 40% OF PEOPLE OPT OUT OF THEIR FORTY DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION RESULTING IN A LOSS OF ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GOING TO LEGAL SERVICES. IN WITH A. B. TEN SIXTY THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS WILL MAKE IT TO LEGAL AID WHICH WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN NEED. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY IN THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE HELP. OF FOR THATREASON I WOULD STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. TEN SIXTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS AND WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SEE NINE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SAY NOT A RING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. AND MEMBERS THIS THIS BILL IS A BIT AND I'M US. NORMALLY I WOULD INSIST THAT. BILLS HAVING TO DO WITH THE BARD DUES BILL THAT SHOULD BE PUT IN THAT BILL WOULD GO THROUGH THE BAR TO SPELL. AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL INSIST ON IN THE FUTURE HOWEVER THIS WHOLE THIS ISSUE HAS SOME HISTORY. MR GRAY AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR QUITE SOMETIME. HERE PROPOSED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT. I GET PUT IN THE BAR DUES BILL. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE GOT SLICED OUT IN SENATE JUDICIARY WITHOUT. I THINK A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE NEED THAT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. WITH TAKING THIS VOLUNTARY MAKING IT MANDATORY AS MISTER GRAY AND I HAVE. DISCUSSED THAT THE TOUGH PART THIS YEAR IS THAT WE KNOW THE BAR DUES BILL IS GOING TO BE INCLUDING. SOME INCREASES IN THE IN THE BAR DUES BUT I WANT TO SEPARATE THAT OUT AND ALSO NOTE. THE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE BEEN SEEKING LEGAL SERVICES FUNDING EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND AGAIN ARE SEEKING THAT IN BUDGET SUB FIVE AGAIN FOR ADDITIONAL LEGAL SERVICES BECAUSE AS DESCRIBED LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION LOSING ITS FEDERAL FUNDING. BUT ALSO WITH MORE MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVING THE NEED WE NEED TO BE SEEKING. FUNDS EVERYWHERE WE CAN AND I THINK IT MISTER GRACE TO CERTAIN OTHERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEIR LACK OF ATTORNEYS THERE THAT ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF FUNDING THERE AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT IF WE CAN. MAKE MORE STABLE THIS FUNDING WE COULD THEN ATTRACT ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS WE'RE LOOKING AT RECIPROCITY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CUT SCORE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIVERSIFYING. THE ENTIRE THOSE THAT'S A HEARING THAT WILL BE YOUR MAY FOURTEENTH. WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIVERSIFYING THE BENCH IN THE BAR AND ALL OF THAT ENTAILS THIS TO ME IS A PIECE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S FINE WITH ME THAT WERE MOVING THIS OUTSIDE THE BAR DUES BILL? I THINK THIS NEEDS ITS OWN SPOTLIGHT A LITTLE BIT AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL PASS IT HERE. SEND THIS OFF TO THE SENATE WHO WILL TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. SO WITH THAT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMON BUSINESS HOURS. I'M IN THE MISTER CHIU. SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY -- THERE IS A HUGE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT ATTORNEYS TO IN THE STATE. AND IT SEEMS -- LIKE A AT FEET THAT IS APPLIED TO EVERY ATTORNEY. EVEN THOSE PROVIDING THE VERY SERVICES WERE TALKING ABOUT FUNDING WHO AREN'T NEARLY PAID THE SAME. AS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT ATTORNEYS ARE MAKING. AN AS AN EXAMPLE TO IF IF YOU ARE -- EITHER I THEIR SOLE PROPRIETOR YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SERVING -- ALONE CAN COMMUNITY LIKE MINE OR YOU'RE DOING LEGAL AID OR A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS IN YOUR PAYING YOUR OWN. JUICE IF YOU WORK FOR A LARGE FIRM. THE FIRM IS PAYING YOUR DUES IN THIS FORTY DOLLARS DOES NOT MATTER. SO THE ACROSS THE BOARD FORTY DOLLARS. I THINK. WHAT I WOULD PREFER TO SEE IS A LARGER INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT THAT -- LARGE FIRMS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE PRO BONO SERVICES THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING ANYWAY BUT THAT THE LARGE FIRMS WERE PAIN FOR CORPORATE CHINESE WHO. WHO MAKE THIS MUCH IN AN HOUR? RIGHT -- CAN SHOULDER AND THAT WE'RE NOT HURTING THE VERY LEGAL PROVIDERS WHO ARE DOING IT FOR FOR VERY LITTLE NOT THIS IDEA THAT ALL ATTORNEYS ARE WEALTHY. IS WRONG RIGHT ALL ATTORNEYS CAN'T AFFORD THIS -- I ALSO AM OPPOSED TO ADDING IT TO THE FEE FOR INACTIVE ATTORNEYS -- BECAUSE HAVING GONE THROUGH IT APPEARED OF TIME WHEN I WAS IN AN ACTIVE ATTORNEY BECAUSE I WAS NOT PRACTICING LAW IN THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO HOLD YOUR YOUR ABILITY. TO TO HAVE A LOT LICENSE IS TO MAKE AN INACTIVE YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING IT WILL IN VERY FEW PROFESSIONS DO YOU PAY. FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE ALREADY PAID FOR BY THE WAY PAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. TOOK THE BAR PAID MY DUES AND I HAVE TO PAY TO REMAIN AN INACTIVE ATTORNEY IN EVER IF I WANT TO A PRACTICE THAT WHICH I PAID. FOR I'M TO NOW BE PAIN TO SUPPLEMENT AT SOMETHING THAT OTHERS ARE IN MUCH BETTER SITUATION TO PAY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A A MOM WHO IS NOT PRACTICING BECAUSE YOUR HOME WITH YOUR CHILD YOU'RE STILL PAYING THAT EXTRA FORTY DOLLARS -- SO. OR MANNER OR A FATHER I'M SORRY IT WOULD BE GENDER SPECIFIC ON THAT SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MR GREY IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH ME. IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S LESS REGRESSIVE. AND ACTUALLY COULD BRING IN MORE MONEY TOWARDS -- THIS VERY NOBLE CAUSE BUT WOULDN'T HURT THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THESE -- SERVICES AT A LOW COST. MR MODIFY -- RECYCLING I MAY RESPOND. MEMBERS COMMENTS I THANK YOU FIRST OFF THE EXPLANATION. OF YOUR VOTE. AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE IS A PROMINENT CHAIR PERSON IN THIS HOUSE -- THIS IS A PROCESS OF COMPROMISE I'VE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND I DON'T RECALL FORGIVE ME HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE. BUT I'VE BEEN BEFORE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. FOR THREE YEARS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHAIRMAN ON A VARIETY OF IDEAS -- THE GENESIS OF THIS AND I HAD A A CONVERSATION SIDEBAR CONVERSATION WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAM CISCO WHO HAD INQUIRED ON MY INTEREST ON THE UBJECTS OF WALKED. COME FROM OBVIOUSLY A VERY. A RURAL COMMUNITY -- WAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY -- IN IN THE STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY. AND I AM A DEVOUT -- CASE WORKER -- WITH MY HISTORY WITH MY OFFICE AND AND THIS INSTITUTION I THINK THE WORK WE DO WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IS. PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NEW LAWS THAT WE PUT ON THE BOOKS. AND IN THAT. EFFORT TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY -- NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE PAST SEVEN YEARS I'VE COME ACROSS -- CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE NEED LEGAL HELP AND WE WENT TO THE LOCAL LEGAL AID AND IT WAS -- EXTRAORDINARILY INADEQUATE. DEL WELL YOU REPRESENT A DISTRICT -- VERY SIMILAR TO MINE -- DEMOGRAPHICALLY YOU ALSO. YOUR DISTRICT HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING VERY CLOSE TO A RICH URBAN AREA. WITH A LOT OF GUILTY LIBERALS IN THE ATTORNEY PROFESSION WHO LIKE TO WRITE BIG CHECKS AND GO TO BIG FUNDRAISERS FOR LEGAL AID WE DON'T. HAVE THAT IN MY DISTRICT OR MISTER GALLAGHER'S DISTRICT -- THEREFORE THERE SET BY A DISPROPORTIONATE PROBLEM HERE THAT EXISTS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. MY ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS TO LOOK TO THE BAR ITSELF. AND NOTE THAT I I THINK THE BAR RECOMMENDS FIFTY HOURS. OF PRO BONO FOR ALL ATTORNEYS I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENT -- LEE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THAT'S NOT MANDATORY THAT'S A VOLUNTARY RECOMMENDATION -- AND I AND SO MY FIRST EFFORT IN THIS IS A ONE WE TAKE HALF OF THAT TWENTY FIVE HOURS. AND MAKE IT MANDATORY EVERY ATTORNEY HAS TO DO TWENTY FIVE HOURS OF PRO BONO [inaudible] OR PAY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS INTO A FUND THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND IN THAT PROPOSAL -- TWO EIGHT TWO CAN RESPOND YOUR QUESTION WE EXEMPTED -- FOLKS THAT ROAD ENGAGED IN THAT WORK WE ALSO MADE SOME INCOME -- CONSIDERATIONS OF YOUR MAKING UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY OR YOU WERE A NEW ATTORNEY IN YOUR FIRST TWO YEARS OF SERVICE PERHAPS DEALING WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT WE MADE IT. WE GOT A BUNCH OF CARVE OUTS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE REYES WHICH I THINK ARE. EXTRAORDINARILY VALID CONCERNS NOW IF YOU'RE MAKING SEVEN HER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR. I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE RIVER COMMUNITIES YOU GUYS CALL THAT LOW INCOME BUT DON'T YOU CAN CERTAINLY AFFORD THE FIVE HER DOLLARS OR THE TWENTY FIVE HOURS. AND AND AGAIN I WANT TO POINT OUT. IT IS THE PROXIMITY TO WEALTHY FIRMS THAT DO A LOT OF GIVING THAT CAN MAKE THOSE URBAN LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS IN A BETTER POSITION IN THE WORLD. AND AGAIN THIS BILL APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD EVERYBODY AND I APPRECIATE -- CHAIRMAN STARS BEEN JUST ABSOLUTELY -- EXTRAORDINARILY HELPFUL IN TRYING TO FIND A LANDING SPOT -- TO MOVE US FORWARD TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS BUT I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID -- I WOULD -- IN A PERFECT WORLD PROBABLY HAVE A BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT WE HAVE A BILL THAT MOVE THINGS FORWARD THAT WOULD IN FACT. GIVE US MORE FUNDING THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TODAY AND BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIA ALBEIT -- IN PERFECT IN THIS -- SAUSAGE MAKING PROCESS. AND AND I WILL GO BACK AND FORTH I JUST -- CAN I GET IT. TO BE VERY CLEAR LEGAL AID IN MY COMMUNITY IS UNDER FUNDED AS WELL AND WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL -- NEED FOR IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS AND THOSE FOR PRACTICING IN THAT FIELD. AT ARE BY NO MEANS MAKING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. OR EVEN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS NOT A AS I SUPPOSE THE STEREO TYPICAL [inaudible] FIRM. JOB AND WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE WE I HAVE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE AND WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ENGAGE. IN LEGAL WORK THAT IS OUTSIDE OF CORPORATE LAW IF YOU WELL. I'M I JUST I I I DON'T WANT TO HURT PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION -- ADDITIONALLY I ALREADY THINK THE BARGES I MEAN ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY ONEROUS -- AND QUITE FRANKLY I IT I ANTICIPATE THEY'LL BE GOING UP THIS YEAR. BUT YOU KNOW WHETHER I LIKE THAT OR NOT I CAN I CAN AFFORD TO PAY THIS FORTY DOLLARS. BUT I I KNOW OTHER ATTORNEYS WHO AS WE CONTINUE TO ADD COST AND FEES IN ESPECIALLY THOSE ATTORNEYS WHO WHO ARE INACTIVE. BUT IT IS IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO ATTACH ADDITIONAL -- COST ON TO THEM SO I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF A MUCH MORE -- A WAY THAT TAKES MONEY FROM OUR OUR CORPORATE FIRMS IN OUR BIG LAW FIRMS-- FOR PAINT WHO ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THESE FEES ON BEHALF OF THEIR ATTORNEYS TO TAKE THAT MONEY AND RE DISTRIBUTED SUPPORT AREAS IN RURAL AREAS LIKE YOURS. YEAH WE'RE BOTH A LITTLE SOCIALIST -- I I'M TOTALLY FOR THAT AND WOULD WOULD WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON A BILL THAT WOULD BE I THINK. MORE FAIR IN CLEAR IN THAT WAY AND I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING -- IF WE COULD ACTUALLY FORCE THE REDISTRIBUTION INTO AREAS WHERE CURRENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY FOR LEGAL AID -- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS I'M GONNA STAY OFF AND I CAN VOTE GETS I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT THIS IN ITS CURRENT FORM AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE IT DOES HURT. THOSE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE DOING THE WORK EVEN YOUR ATTORNEY HERE I AM SURE YOU GOT SOME OUT THERE WHO ARE YOU KNOW. LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND AND DOING THEIR BEST AND AND PAIN. WHEN THIS FEAT COMES UP EVERY YEAR IS LIKE? TRYING TO VESTED TO GET BY SO I I DON'T WANT -- TO ADD TO THE BURDEN. A MISTER CHIU ANIMUS READ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- LET ME START BY SAYING FIRST I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO ABOUT THE REGRESSIVITY OF OUR STATE BAR DO STRUCTURE -- AND WOULD ASK OUR CHAIRMAN AS WE START LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE OF OF BAR FEES IF THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR US TO CONSIDER -- MY WIFE AND I BOTH GOT OUR STARTS AS AS PUBLIC INTEREST LAWYERS IN THIS VERY WORLD IN THE FACT THAT WHEN I WAS MAKING IN THE THIRTIES AND SAN FRANCISCO. I WAS PAYING THE SAME BAR DUES AS MY LAW FIRM PARTNER FRIENDS WHO WERE MAKING MANY MANY TIMES THAT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME -- BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS DOING HERE I COME TO A VERY DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ABOUT WHY I NOT ONLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT I'M HAPPY TO MOVE MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD -- WE HAVE HEARD THE VERY STRONG CASE AND WHY THIS IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I WILL SAY REPRESENTING -- A HIGH CUSTER BEEN AREA WHY WE WHILE WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF LEGAL AID SOCIETY ATTORNEYS AND OTHERS THAT ARE SERVING -- POPULATIONS THAT ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF LEGAL AID WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH AND I KNOW FOR A FACT BECAUSE MY WIFE USED TO RUN A PROGRAM. BRINGING PRIVATE SECTOR ATTORNEYS TO RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA JUST HOW INCREDIBLY DIRE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE CONFRONTED WITH AND RURAL DISTRICTS. AROUND THE STATE THE NEEDS ARE INTENSE EVERYWHERE BUT PARTICULARLY. IN UNDERSERVED PLACES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW I OFTEN WILL SAY THAT IF YOU GET. IF YOU'RE ARRESTED FOR SHOPLIFTING TOOTHPASTE AT WALGREENS YOU WILL HAVE SOMEONE OF THE CALIBER OF FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER ARCH KALRA DEFENDING YOU IN COURT. BUT IF YOUR KIDS ARE ABOUT TO TO BE DEPRIVE FROM YOU IN A CUSTODY PROCEEDING IF ABOUT TO BE EVICTED FROM YOUR HOME AND MADE HOMELESS IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE DEPORTED AND RIPPED AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY. IN AN IMMIGRATION PROCEEDING YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY AND I DO HOPE THAT THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL CONSIDER WHETHER. CIVIL GETTING IN AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO TO WRITE THIS. SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BUT LET ME JUST END WITH ONE POINT WHICH IS I DO HAVE -- ONE MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL IT IT IS IS BY NO MEANS ENOUGH. THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY BRING THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND THAT IS WHAT. THE THE THE SMALL PRO BONO CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR LARGEST LAW FIRMS ARE. FORTY DOLLARS IS AS MR CAR AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT REPRESENTS ABOUT SIX MINUTES OF WORK FOR YOUR AVERAGE BIG FROM ATTORNEY. AND EVEN TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE HOURS THAT REFLECTS AS I JUST TO THE CALCULATION 122% OF THE TIME A BREAK FROM ATTORNEYS. AND SO THE REALITY IS -- 90% BALL TOURNEY'S WORK FOR THE TOP WHICH MEANS THAT -- 10% WILL TOURNEY'S REPRESENTS EVERYONE ELSE AND THAT'S JUST NOT A SITUATION THAT IS TERRIBLE SO. I HOPE THAT WE WILL MOVE THIS FOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE THIS. LEGISLATION FOR TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING I DO HOPE IF THIS PASSES WE CAN KEEP BUILDING ON IT -- BECAUSE WE ARE BY NO MEANS DONE IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TO JUSTICE AND AMERICA. SO I THINK THAT IS A MOTION. IS THERE A SECOND AND THE SECOND THANK YOU MISS REST. THANK YOU MISTER SHARON THANK YOU MISTER GRAY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I DO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE SPECIFICALLY ON THE INACTIVE MEMBERS. I AS A VOLUNTEER WITH LEGAL AID FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS AND AS A BOARD MEMBER WITH OUR LEGAL AID KNOWING WHAT IT IS. DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY OUR STAFF. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS I I ABSOLUTELY WELL SUPPORTED I DO WANT SOMETHING TO BE LOOKED AT REGARDING ARENA IN ACTIVE MEMBERS. AND THEN FOR FINDING OUT HOW WE INCREASE THE FEES FOR SOME OF THE OTHERS WHO CAN ABSOLUTELY AFFORD IT -- BUT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR SEPARATING THIS FROM EVERYTHING ELSE RELATED TO BAR DUES I THINK THIS ONE DESERVES ITS OWN BILL THIS GALLAGHER. OF MR GREY'S AS AS TEMPTING AS WEALTHIEST REDISTRIBUTION IS INVOLVING INTERNEES -- AND CRABS ATTACKS AGAINST ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I DO HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THAT YOU KNOW NOT ALL ATTORNEYS OR ARE THE SAME WE CAN ALL BE PROP SIXTY FIVE ATTORNEYS. AND GET THOSE BIG ATTORNEY FEES AWARDS -- AND LOOK I I I DO WANT TO SEE AFTER LOOKING AT THIS AND AND LOOKING AT MY OWN COMMUNITY I I DO SEE THAT. THIS ISN'T AS BIG OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE ACTUALLY 70% OF ATTORNEYS CHECK THE BOX -- TO GIVE TO LEGAL AID IN THIS IN THIS STATE SO THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY SAY YES I WILL AND IN MY OWN COMMUNITY WE HAVE. LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET TOGETHER WE HAVE A FUNDRAISER EVERY YEAR. FOR SO THERE IS A LOT I MEAN MAYBE IT'S NOT EVERY COMMUNITY BUT I I'VE I PERSONALLY SEE A LOT OF A VOLUNTARY SUPPORT GOING THERE THERE'S SOME GREAT ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS WORK. AND SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT MAKING IT MANDATORY IS REALLY NECESSARY AT THIS TIME SO. CAN'T SUPPORTED TODAY I I DO APPRECIATE -- WHERE THAT IS COMING FROM THE -- FROM YOU AND AND YOUR INTENT BEHIND THE BILL. NO ONE ELSE ALL RIGHT SO MEMBERS WHAT WOULD ASKS I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL PASS HERE TODAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SIMPLISTIC LOOK AT IT BUT IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW IN THE SENATE WORKING OUR WAY IS THE BAR DUES BILL. AND THE BAR IS ASKING FOR A SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF MONEY THIS IS I THINK IF WE'RE CLEAR. OUR OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF THAT FEE STRUCTURE OUT AND STILL ALLOWING THE BAR. TO RAISE THE MONEY THAT IT NEEDS TO OPERATE ALTHOUGH THEY I WILL ADMIT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE AND ESTABLISHED. THAT NEED I WOULD THINK. THAT'S WHERE WE COULD HAVE THE BIGGEST EFFECT ON ATTORNEYS WHO ARE AT THE LOW END OF THE THE WAGE SCALE BECAUSE NOT ALL THE TREES ARE MAKING. AS MUCH MONEY AND ESPECIALLY THOSE ATTORNEYS WHERE THOSE FIRMS ARE VERY LARGE AND EXPENSIVE IN THE FIRM'S PAY FOR THE FEES ANYWAY. I THINK THERE'S SHOULD BE A LACK OF SYMPATHY. TO THE THE BURDEN THAT THAT PROVIDES. SO I'M HOPING WE CAN MOVE THIS AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO MR GRAY AND AND WORK THIS THROUGH THAT'S FINE. BUT I WILL POINT OUT OUR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DENT IN THIS IS AS THE BAR DUES. BILL COMES OVER. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PUSH BACK IN THIS COMMITTEE TO THIS NOTION OF INCREASING DUES ANYWAY SO IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO RESTRUCTURE IT. THAT I AM GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP WITH AS A COMMITTEE AND I'M HOPING WE CAN COME UP WITH. AT APPROACH THAT ALL OF US CAN STAND TOGETHER WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE IN THE BAR OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BY STANDING TOGETHER SO BUT THAT'S COMING LATER. THIS AGREEMENT CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS -- I APPRECIATE ALL THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS. THANK QUESTIONS ON THE BILL AT THE END THE SENTIMENT WHAT I DO HERE FOR EVERYONE -- IT IS A SENTIMENT THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE -- WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROPOSAL IS THE PERFECT PROPOSAL -- OR WHETHER IS BEGINNING OF A A LONGER DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE THE OPTIMIST CHAIRMAN TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ON ITS OWN -- SEPARATE SO THANK YOU -- FOR BRING IT FOR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND THAT -- THEN THAT PROCESS. WHICH GALLAGHER APPRECIATE -- YOUR GET YOUR COMMENTS I'M NOT SURE I'M GONNA CALL IT WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION MAYBE ATTACKS ON ATTORNEYS I THINK I AGREE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT I'M GLAD I COULD -- THROUGH THIS BILL BRING PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND MISS CONSOLS TOGETHER. ON SOME COMMON. IN. AND EVEN FURTHER I APPRECIATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU -- A YOUR SUGGESTIONS -- I HOPE THAT I CAN REACH OUT TO I KNOW IF I CAN FIND ANY ATTORNEYS WHO MAY BE SAID ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT ALL CERTAINLY. SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME AND GET YOUR EXPERTISE AND MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE CAN REMEMBER THAT OUR COURT SYSTEM TOP ON TERRY. AND SO PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE THAT AND WE NEED TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES -- FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SUPPORT THEMSELVES MOST MUSIC THANK YOU WITH THAT ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT -- HERE THIS MORNING.
