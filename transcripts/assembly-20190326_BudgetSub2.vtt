I'M PAGE TWO WE COVER THE

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH THE

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.076
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.911

ON TO PAGE.

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.314
THREE OUR THIS PAGE CONTAINS OUR

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.216
ASSESSMENTS OUT WE OUTLINED

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.518
THREE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THE

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.520
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.687
FIRST WE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.856
DIGITAL GRANTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:20.558
CHEAT THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:21.692
MORE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:22.794
PROGRAMS.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.995
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE ON

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:26.297
PAGE THREE WE ANALYZE THE

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.765
INITIAL ROUND OF APPLICANTS AND

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:30.368
FOUND THAT 76%.

00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.302
OF THE SEVENTY APPLICANTS

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:34.305
ALREADY RUN FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:35.940
THESE ARE PROGRAMS LARGELY TO

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.942
ARE LARGELY APPLYING TO REPLACE

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.211
EXISTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.913
CLASSROOMS THAT O NOT MEET CD

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.514
E. REGULATIONS THIS WAS A

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.516
SECONDARY PURPOSE FOR THESE

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:46.384
GRANTS.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.819
IF THE LEGISLATURE WORD EXPANDS

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.020
THE PROGRAM AS THE GOVERNOR

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:51.155
PROPOSES WE THINK A SIMILARLY

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.690
HIGH SHARE OF THE GRANTS WOULD

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.392
GO TOWARDS DISTRICTS ALREADY

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:56.260
RUNNING FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.496
SECONDLY WE FOUND THAT DISTRICTS

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:00.631
ME OPERATE PARTY PROGRAMS FOR A

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.967
VARIETY OF REASONS BEYOND JUST

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.635
FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. FOR

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.304
EXAMPLE SOME DISTRICTS TOLD US

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.472
THAT THEIR PARENTS PREFERRED TO

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.307
SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO PART DAY

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.409
PROGRAMS -- OTHER DISTRICTS

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.944
INDICATED THAT THEIR TEACHERS

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.679
PREFER PART DAY PROGRAMS BECAUSE

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:16.447
THEY LEAD CLASS FOR PART OF THE

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.815
DAY AND THEY OFFER OTHER

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:20.618
TEACHERS ASSISTANCE AT AND YOUR

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.252
THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:21.752
DAY.

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.120
GIVEN THOSE ISSUES WE THINK THAT

00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:24.188
SOME PORTION OF DISTRICTS

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.590
RUNNING PARTY PROGRAMS MAY

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.891
SIMPLY NOT BE INTERESTED IN

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.326
THESE GRANTS.

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.728
THIRD MOST DISTRICTS OPERATING A

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.497
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN WERE ABLE

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:33.898
TO COVER EXIST WERE ABLE TO

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.132
COVER FACILITY COSTS WITH

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.834
EXISTING SOURCES OF STATE AND

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:38.169
LOCAL FUNDING.

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:39.370
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:41.205
SHARE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:44.742
FULL DAY PROGRAMS GREW FROM 43%

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.776
270%.

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.211
A DISTRICT INTERESTED IN RUNNING

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.479
FULL DAY PROGRAMS MAY BE

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:50.314
ELIGIBLE FOR FACILITY FUNDING

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.716
UNDER THE EXISTING SCHOOL

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:53.651
FACILITY PROGRAM THE STATE'S

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.520
BROADER LONGER STANDING PROGRAM

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.154
THAT HELPS STIFF SPONGE SCHOOL

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.623
FACILITIES FOR ALL GRADES.

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.358
OR DISTRICTS MAY RELY ON LOCAL

00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:04.495
FINDS A DRESS SO ANY CONSTRAINTS.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:05.029
FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:05.830
RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.865
REFRAIN FROM EXPANDING THE

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.667
PROGRAM AT THIS TIME.

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:11.135
TURNING TO PAGE FOUR AND WE DO

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:14.071
OFFER TO TARGETED OPTIONS TO THE

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:16.407
LEGISLATURE REMAIN INTERESTED IN

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.042
PROMOTING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:19.377
FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:21.012
REVISIT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.914
NEXT YEAR AFTER KNOWS MORE ABOUT

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.049
THE DEMANDS AFTER THE INITIAL

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.450
ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS AWARDED.

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.352
IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.521
PROVIDE MORE FACILITY GRANTS

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:32.023
BASED ON ANY REMAINING DEMANDS

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.990
WE RECOMMEND IT.

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:35.159
FOCUS THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.627
ON DISTRICTS RUNNING PARTY

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.429
PROGRAMS DUE TO FACILITY

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:39.430
CONSTRAINTS.

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:40.932
SECONDLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.233
CONSIDER CREATING AN EVEN

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.834
STRONGER INCENTIVE FOR FULL DAY

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:46.103
PROGRAMS BY REDUCING THE PARTY

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.706
PER STUDENT RATE UNDER LCF OVER

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:50.141
THREE YEARS.

00:36:50.207 --> 00:36:52.243
CURRENTLY PART DAY AND FULL DAY

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.111
PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED AT THE SAME

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.713
PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVEL AND

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.682
THIS IS DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:59.450
IN INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS.

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.185
HOWEVER BEFORE LOWERING THE PART

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:02.954
DAY RATE THAT LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.255
CONSIDER WEIGHING THE TRADE OFFS

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:05.823
CAREFULLY SINCE SOME PARENTS DO

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.960
PREFER TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.727
APART DAY PROGRAMS.

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:10.528
WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.696
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- AND MY

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:12.597
COLLEAGUE FROM ALLEY -- WILL BE

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.332
COVERING THE REMAINDER OF A HAND

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:31.415
SURE I KNOW WE HAVE A FEW

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.583
QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.818
ASK THE FIRST ONE I KNOW YOU'RE

FIFTY MORE THIS YEAR.

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:57.775

EXPAND THE FULL DAY.

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.622
SURE -- YET WHEN WE WERE

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:12.790
DEVELOPING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.392
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:15.760
SEEING THE THE TYPES OF

IN AN ESTIMATE AN ASSUMPTION

00:38:53.397 --> 00:38:54.799
THAT THERE THERE WOULD BE SOME

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.500
DEMAND FROM THOSE DISTRICTS

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.968
AFTER A PROPER INCENTIVES WERE

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:58.836
THERE TO REDUCE THE MAIN BARRIER

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:00.371
WHICH FROM THE RESEARCH WE

AT WHAT THE BENEFITS OF FULL DAY

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.804
PURSES PART DAY.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:40.938
WERE FROM A PEDAGOGICAL POINT OF

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.473

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.644
SAME.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.212
SURE SO WE DID EXPLICITLY

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.881
INCLUDE A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:52.650
RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS BUT WE DID

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.018
TAKE A BRIEF LOOK AT IT.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:54.952
THROUGH THE MAIN PROPONENT OF

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.453
THE MAIN ARGUMENTS THAT THE

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.022
PROPONENT SHARES A IS THAT

00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:00.124
HAVING MORE INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.193
BENEFITS CHILDREN ESPECIALLY LOW

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:05.429
INCOME CHILDREN -- AND THIS IS

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:06.597
MORE LIKELY TO PRAYER THEM

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.098
BETTER FOR FIRST GRADE AND THIS

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.733
ALSO HELPS PARENTS WITH CHILD

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.868
CARE NEEDS.

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:13.103
WHEN WE DID A TIME LIMITED

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.939
REVIEW OF THE LITTLE RESEARCH WE

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.473
FOUND THAT SOME RESEARCH DID

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.475
SUPPORT ACADEMIC BENEFITS BUT

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:19.944
OFTEN TIMES THERE WAS A FEET OUT

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.612
A FACT SO YOU COULD SEE

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.047
IMPROVEMENTS AND EITHER READING

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:24.548
OR MATH BUT THEY WOULD?

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.317
DISAPPEAR BY FIRST OR THIRD

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:29.320
GRADER SOMEONE -- AND SO IN OUR

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.955
UNDERSTANDING THE RESEARCH ISN'T

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:32.256
ENTIRELY.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.757
CONCLUSIVE BUT UP THERE IS A

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.092
FAIR AMOUNT OF SUPPORT OF

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:36.260
EVIDENCE OUT THERE.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:38.596
GREAT IN IN TERMS IN JUST IN

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.898
TERMS OF THE REGION -- IT IS IT

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.366
IS A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.101
WHO DOES FULL DAY VERSUS --

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:45.269
PARTY OR IS IT IS OUR

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:49.473
CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN PARTS

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.541
OF THE STATE.

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:51.342
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:53.410
TREND IS MORE BY INCOME LEVEL --

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:53.944
PER DAY SEEMS TO BE MORE

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.079
PREVALENT.

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.514
AMONG HIGHER INCOME GEHRY AS

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:59.450
WHEREAS FULL DAY SEEMS TO BE

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.851
MORE PROBABLY IN LOWER INCOME

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:03.053
AREAS -- WE BELIEVE PART OF THIS

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.989
IS BECAUSE IN HIGHER INCOME

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.657
AREAS PARENTS DO HAVE OTHER

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.225
CHILD CARE OPTIONS AND SO IT

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:11.195
MIGHT BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.763
THEIR SCHEDULE OR THEY'RE DOING

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.200
THEIR NEEDS TO ACTUALLY.

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.001
DO PART DAY.

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.269
THANK YOU AND THEN WITH WITH THE

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:22.139
CURRENT -- GRANT PROCESS -- YOU

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:24.508
HAD MENTIONED LOOKS LIKE.

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:27.244
I BELIEVE -- NINE NINE DISTRICTS

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.512
THAT ARE FULL AND PART DAY

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:29.880
APPLIED AND THEN. EIGHT

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:32.416
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART DAY ONLY

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:33.884
THEN THEN BASED ON THAT GO HOW

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:34.818
WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.086
PERCENTAGE WOULD JUMP FROM

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:39.857
BECAUSE YOU HAD 70% FULL DAY.

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:40.457
TWO WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IT'LL

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:42.192
MOVE TO BASED ON THAT -- THAT

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:44.995
PARTICIPATION.

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.530
AND THEN THE AND THE SUPER

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:50.334
TENNIS OPTICALLY AFTER TWO OR

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.435
OUR ACCOUNT MINOR AT THE OFFICE

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:52.937
OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION I

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.505
AM IN THIS ROUND WE DID SEE THE

00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:55.639
MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS THAT

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.041
APPLIED WERE ALREADY OFFERING

00:42:57.107 --> 00:42:58.809
FULL THEY CAN -- BUT ON THE

00:42:58.876 --> 00:42:59.977
APPLICATION FORMS THEY'VE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.278
INDICATED THAT THEY'RE OFFERING

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.746
IN CLASSROOMS THAT WERE NOT

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:04.682
DESIGNED OR MAYBE ARE NOT

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:05.215
SUITABLE FOR KINDERGARTEN

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:06.216
PURPOSES.

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.484
WE HAVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT

00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:09.286
TEACHER WORK ROOMS OR SCIENCE

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.688
LABS ARE JUST ROOMS THAT WERE

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:12.156
NOT DESIGNED FOR KINDERGARTEN.

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:13.724
YEAH BUT IT WAS SIXTEEN

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:16.593
DISTRICTS OUT OF A SEVENTY TWO

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.494
THAT DID NOT OFFER FULL DAY

00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:20.597
KINDERGARTEN SO WE WOULD -- IF

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.299
THERE WERE NO PROGRAM CHANGES WE

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:23.400
WOULD EXPECT ALL OF THESE

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.602
DISTRICTS TO APPLY AGAIN IN THE

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:26.203
SECOND ROUND BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.838
NOT.

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:29.173
ALL OF THEM OVERSEE FUNDING THIS

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:30.541
ROUND SO THAT PERCENTAGE CAM

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:31.608
COULD BE THE SAME BUT WE ALSO

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.177
ARE GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:34.311
OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:35.679
THAT DID NOT APPLY IN THE FIRST

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.214
ROUND SO WE ANTICIPATE

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.682
ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS COMING IN

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:39.817
FOR OUR SECOND ROUND THAT OPENS

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.285
UP IN MAY AS WELL WE DON'T KNOW

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.686
THE BREAKDOWN YET OF WHAT

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.088
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING.

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:45.055
FOR DO YOU DO HAVE A SENSE OF

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.357
WHAT THE PERCENTAGE MIGHT JUMP

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.291
TO THEN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:50.828
AT 70% FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:51.128
[inaudible]

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:54.031
AND WE IT'S KINDA HARD TO TELL

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.966
AT THIS POINT WE WOULD MAYBE

00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.501
KNOW A LITTLE MORE AFTER THE

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:59.703
SECOND ROUND BUT WE ARE GETTING

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.471
CALLS FROM THOSE THAT DON'T

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.006
CURRENTLY OFFER IT IT'S JUST WE

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:04.174

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.379
LA IS POINT SO SO YOU'RE WHAT

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:12.116
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT --

00:44:12.182 --> 00:44:16.086
THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS LESS

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.621
PARTICIPATION OR OR THEY'VE

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.590
MOVING IN TO A PART THAT SCRIPT

00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:21.058
PART TIME IS RIGHT PRIMARILY THE

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:24.461
THE HIGHER INCOME ERROR IS THAT

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:24.895
IS THAT [inaudible]

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.663
CORRECT.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.297

HAD SAID EARLIER THAT.

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.935
THE DISTRICTS THAT HAD PARTAKE

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.203
IN THE GARDEN A LOT OF THEM WERE

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.272
DOING IT MORE OUT OF CONVENIENCE

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.074
AND THEIR PARENTAL INTEREST

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.308
WHICH IS.

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:41.645
A BIT SO THEY ARE HIRING CAMARO

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.212
SOURCES LOWER INCOME AREAS.

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.781
YES BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.082
LOWER INCOME AREAS THAT ARE

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.281
PROVIDING FULL THEY CAN -- DOES

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:33.817
ANYONE HERE KNOW THAT.

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.919
IT DOES LOOK LIKE WE DO DO WE

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:37.321
KNOW HOW MANY TITLE.

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.455
ONE OKAY BELIEVE IT AT THAT BUT

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.790
I JUST I JUST WANT TO BACK UP

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.691
TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT A

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.292
SCHOOL SITE TO WHEN THERE IS.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.694
PART A KENDER.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.895
AND I THINK AGAIN I'VE BEEN

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.396
PRETTY CLEAR THROUGHOUT THIS

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:48.198
DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.466
THIS A COUPLE YEARS I KNOW MR

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.067
TINGS A BIG PROPONENTOF THIS

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:50.867
CONCEPT.

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:52.502
WITH THAT TITLE ONE SCHOOLS NEED

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:53.604
TO BE FIRST.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.573
THAT THAT THAT'S MY BIG PRIORITY

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.475
AND THEIR IMMEDIATE -- BECAUSE

00:47:58.542 --> 00:48:00.010
THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE CONNECTION.

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.613
BETWEEN PEOPLE THEY CAN -- IN

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:03.580
CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:06.149
VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; QUALITATIVE BE A&lt;/c&gt;

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.085
QUANTITATIVE -- ALSO ON A SCHOOL

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.119
SAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOL

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.854
DAY I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK BY

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.055
THE TEACHER THAT THE KIND OF OUR

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:12.756
TEACHER ONLY WORKS HALF AND THEN

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:13.690
THE THE REST THEY MAY THEY GO

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.092
HOME EARLY THAT THAT'S NOT ALL

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:17.261
THE CASE -- IF IT'S DONE RIGHT

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.829
AND TYPICALLY IT IS DONE RIGHT

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:21.131
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:23.066
WHEN THAT -- PART DAY CANDOR

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:24.201
TEACHER IS NOT WITH THEIR HEART

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:25.602
A CLASS BECAUSE THE DAY HAS

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:26.570
ENDED THEY WILL GO INTO ANOTHER

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.005
CLASSROOM IT TYPICALLY WOULD BE

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:29.840
A KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.408
SO TEACHERS WOULD DOUBLE UP.

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:32.976
BASICALLY GIVE STUDENTS FOCUS OR

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:34.511
THEY MIGHT BE IN A GREAT ONE TWO

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:35.545
THREE DOING A READING RECOVERY

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:36.813
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.881
SO I JUST YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:40.417
IMPACTS TO OF OF OF CREATING FOR

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.018
THEY CAN -- BECAUSE YOU GONNA

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:42.319
TAKE SOME TEACHERS OUT OF

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:43.453
CLASSROOM SO THEY MIGHT

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.955
OTHERWISE BE IN.

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:46.390
CLOSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS I

00:48:46.456 --> 00:48:50.260
JUST WANT THAT DYNAMIC TO BE TO

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:50.827

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.934
ALSO I THINK IT HAS A GOOD

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:59.603
QUESTION MISTER O'DONNELL ABOUT.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.570

HAVE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.775
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE SO IF

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.076
SOMEONE'S HERO.

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.911
WHAT'S TO COME UP AND HAS THE

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.847
ANSWER -- YOU'RE WELCOME BUT YOU

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:11.815

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.451
KNOW WE DON'T KNOW.

00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:16.753
I ALSO WANTED TO ABOUT EVEN IF

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.689
IT IS -- THE FACILITIES IN

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:21.224
CLASSROOMS THE ISSUE IS IS IS

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.726
THE RATED SO.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.895
HAVING YOU KNOW DOUBLE DOUBLE

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:27.431
DARE ONCE A DAY -- DOES IT MAKE

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:28.999
SENSE TO TO ALTER.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.335
THE AMOUNT THAT WE THAT WE PAY

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:32.369
FOR THE STATE FOR FULL DAY

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:35.939
VERSES PARK DAY TO INCENTIVIZE.

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.507
DISTRICTS TO GO [inaudible]

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:41.078
FULL DAY.

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.179
WE THINK THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:44.214
LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE WE

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:44.815
UNDERSTAND IT IS QUITE A SHIFT

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:45.482
FROM.

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:47.317
WE GET THAT BUT YES IS IT A GOOD

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.985
IDEA.

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.520
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MERITS TO

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:51.688
THAT IDEA WHICH IS WHY WE

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:53.557
BROUGHT IT UP AS A POTENTIAL

00:49:53.623 --> 00:49:55.258
OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.461
I'M CURRENTLY PER DAY AND FULL

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.029
THEY ARE FIND IT AT THE SAME

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.664
RATE DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:02.199
INSTRUCTIONAL OUR IN SO IT MAY

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:04.234
BE A SIMPLE INCENTIVE THAT

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.669
WOULDN'T.

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.671
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.906
ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO PICK UP

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:11.375
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN YEAH WILL

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.676
BE THE DOWNSIDE OF COURSE THAT

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:14.044
THEIR SON THEY'RE DOING FULL DAY

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.813
AND SO THE SOMEONE OF A WINDFALL

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.081
FOR THEM.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.216
BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE DOWNSIDE

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:19.983
IF IF THERE DISTRICTS THAT.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.118
FOR VARIOUS REASONS PARENT

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.619
DEMAND.

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:25.689
JUST SPACE LIMITATIONS.

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:28.658
WHERE WE REDUCE THE RATE?

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.094
FOR YES FOR CLASSROOMS AGO PARK

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.729
DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WHAT

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:34.197
POTENTIALLY WOULD BE THAT THE

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.799
DOWNSIDE TO THAT.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:38.902
I'M STILL AT JUST TO CLARIFY.

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.070
DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING FULL

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:41.638
DAY KINDERGARTEN THEY WOULDN'T

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.039
SEE A CHANGE AND THEY'RE FINDING

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.541
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL.

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.076
IT WOULD JUST BE DISTRICTS

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.478
RUNNING PART DAY PROGRAMS -- I

00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:50.414
THINK THEIR CONSIDERATIONS WOULD

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.450
REALLY BE SOME PARENTS PREFER

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:55.986
NOT TO RUN OR NOT.

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:56.987
TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO FULL

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:58.555
THEY PROGRAMS AND SO SOME OF

00:50:58.622 --> 00:50:59.423
THESE DISTRICTS MAYBE

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:00.957
INTENTIONALLY CHOOSING TO RUN

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:02.192
PART DAY PROGRAMS IN REFLECTION

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:05.162

THIS READ ON IF I MAY.

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:10.801
I I THINK THERE WOULD BE A

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.135
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IF YOU'RE

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:13.937
PAYING IF YOU'RE GOING.

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.372
TO BUY FOR GATE DID THAT BUT

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:15.972
I'VE YOU'RE GONNA SPLIT UP HOW

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:18.675
YOU PAY -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.577
IF YOU PAY THEM FOR PART DAY AND

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:21.812
PAY THE PAY THEM SO MUCH FOR

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:24.047
PART IN AND MAYBE MORE FOR FULL

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:24.414
THEY REMEMBER.

YOUR TYPICALLY GOING TO HAVE A

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:26.716
FULL TIME TEACHER THERE AND AS I

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:29.619
MENTIONED EARLIER THAT FULL TIME

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:31.221
TEACHER HAS DUTIES OTHER THAN.

IS THAT THAT THAT. THREE HOURS

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.024
THREE HOURS THEY MIGHT SPEND

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.192
WITH STUDENTS SO THAT I THINK

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:35.459
THERE'D.

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.693

THOSE WHO CAN TAKE UP A FULL

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.696
THEY SLIDE IT'S REMOVING -- THE

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:33.997
WORK RECALL OF ITS REMOVING THE

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.231
REQUIREMENT THAT FAMILIES HAVE

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:36.900
TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL TO FOR

THEIR CHILDREN TO BE ELIGIBLE

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:39.002
FOR THE FULL DAY PROGRAM.

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.737
THE OTHER THING IT DOES IS IT

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.939
SHIFTING ON SOME OF THE STATE

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.140
PRIEST THE SOME OF THE PRESS A

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:45.408
STATE PRESCHOOL FUNDS THAT ARE

FUNDED THROUGH PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.745
OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY SO.

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:50.613
UP AND NON ELLIE IS WOULD BE

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.050
FUNDED COMPLETELY WITH NINE

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.251
NINETY EIGHT MONEY.

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:56.753
I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE EIGHT IS

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:59.122
OUR ASSESSMENT.

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.157
A WE WE THINK THAT EXPANDING

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.525
STATE PRESCHOOL FOR NON ELEAZAR

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.027
IS MORE LIKELY TO ADDRESS THE

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:05.395
NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES AND

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.229
THIS IS BECAUSE IN OUR

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:08.231
CONVERSATIONS WITH -- NON

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.766
ELEAZAR TENDED TO OPERATE LONGER

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.669
PROGRAMS -- TYPICALLY A TEN

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:14.704
HOURS A PROGRAMS OR MORE -- SO

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.973
WE THINK THIS WOULD ADDRESS

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.008
FAMILIES AT WORK LONGER HOURS.

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.376
WE DO KNOW THAT THE STATE AND

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:21.845
PROVIDERS AND MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:22.979
TO EXPAND AS QUICKLY AS THE

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.380
GOVERNOR PROPOSES.

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:25.448
AND THIS IS RECOGNIZING SOME

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.783
ADMINISTRATIVE AND LOGISTICAL

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:28.651
CHALLENGES.

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.286
ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE ON THIS

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.155
WOULD BE A HEAVY LIFT FOR THE

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.290
PURPOSE OF EDUCATION -- THEY

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:36.025
WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE.

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.227
TO THEY WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.361
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REVIEW

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.863
APPLICATIONS FROM HUNDREDS

00:56:39.929 --> 00:56:41.364
ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS WHICH WOULD

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.032
OKAY A MUCH LARGER WORKLOAD

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:45.368
COMPARED TO THE OF THE PRIOR

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:48.138
MORE MODERATE EXPANSION -- AND

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:50.006
WE DO WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.641
THE LAST TIME NINE LA PROVIDERS

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:54.210
WERE YOUR MARKS LOTS IT WAS ONE

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:54.844
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED PLUS WHICH

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:55.111
IS QUITE.

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.513
WHICH IS A MUCH LOWER AMOUNT OF

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:59.215
SLOTS COMPARED -- TO THAT WHAT

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:00.250
IS PROPOSED.

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:01.818
AND WE'RE ALSO RECOGNIZING SOME

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.219
LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES ON

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:04.888
FACILITIES ARE A KEY COMPONENT

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.456
OF THE OF THIS EXPANSION AND

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.424
THIS A MAGNITUDE OF EXPANSION

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.426
FOR REQUIRE PROVIDERS.

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.195
TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES --

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.696
WHICH COULD WHICH COULD BE A

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:17.901
BARRIER FOR SOME PROVIDERS.

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.335
MOVING ON TO PAGE -- NINE WE

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:20.937
CONTINUE OUR ASSESSMENT ON THIS

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.539
PAGE WE DISCUSSED THE WORK

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.873
REQUIREMENT WE THINK THE WORK

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.875
REQUIREMENT IS REASONABLE TO

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.677
PRIORITIZE FULL DAY CARE -- TO

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:28.812
MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SLOTS ARE

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:30.246
AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THAT HAVE

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:32.649
THE WORKING OR SCHOOL

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:33.783
REQUIREMENT MEANS.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.118
AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT ALL

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:37.120
LOW INCOME ELIGIBLE CHILDREN HOW

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:37.987
ARE.

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:38.922
ALTHOUGH INCOME CHILDREN ARE

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.657
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PART A PART OF

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:43.126
THIS PROGRAM -- AND THEN WE ALSO

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.994
NOTE THAT REMOVING THE WORK

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.196
REQUIREMENT COULD INCREASE COULD

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.630
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE COST

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.465
OF THE PROGRAM SO THE FULL DAY

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.167
SLOT IS DOUBLE THE COST OF A

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:52.635
PARTY SLOT SO THIS COULD CREATE

00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:53.403
SOME COST PRESSURE ON THE

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.605
PROGRAM WHERE SOME SLOTS TO

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:56.072
CONVERT.

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.674
SOME PARTY THOUGHTS WERE COULD

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.075
TO CONVERT TO FILL THE SLOTS --

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.443
AN ABSENT ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.579
THIS COULD RESULT IN SERVING

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:03.179
FEWER CHILDREN.

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.747
WE HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:07.050
PAGE -- TEN AND IF THE

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.418
LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:09.452
ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S LONG

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.720
TERM PLAN OF SERVING ALL LOW

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:11.988
INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WE JUST

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:13.356
HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS.

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.258
AND THE FIRST IS TO START UP TO

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.693
FUNDS FEWER SLOTS IN THE FIRST

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:19.762
YEARI'M STE IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:20.897
OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN.

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.699
AND STARTING SLOTS OF IN

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:23.900
STARTING THE SLOTS MEDIA YOU

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.969
SUMMARIZE WHAT THEN PAGE TEN

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:27.704
ONLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PAGE.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.572
TEN SUMMARY -- I AM SO SORRY

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.407
GIVE US THAT SNAPSHOT YEAH SO

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.542
FIRST THING IS WE'RE SAYING

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:33.910
FUNDS FEWER SLOTS -- AND AND

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.411
THAT'S IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:37.213
INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THE THE

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.082
THE THE PLAN OF SERVING ALL LOW

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:39.916
INCOME FOR YOUR OWN THAT THREE

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:42.752
STATE WE SHOULD FUND TWENTY FIVE

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:43.419
HUNDRED NOT YEAH WE'RE JUST THEN

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.722
WE SHOULD ACTUALLY -- TWENTY TWO

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:46.256
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AS A

00:58:46.322 --> 00:58:47.724
STARTING POINT -- THAT THE

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.025
LEGISLATURE COULD FIND MORE OR

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:50.460
LESS BUT TAKING THIS FIRST YEAR

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:52.428
IN LOOKING AT AND LETTING IT BE

00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:53.596
A BENCHMARK FOR WHAT THEY COULD

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.598
CONSIDER TO FIND IN FUTURE YEARS

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.433
TO MEET THE GOAL OF SERVING ALL

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.434
INCOME FOR OLD.

00:58:58.501 --> 00:59:00.270
ROSS IS SUGGESTING START A

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.171
FUNDING SLOTS MID YEAR JUST TO

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.239

ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SO FAR

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.306
OUTSTRIPPED THE AMOUNT OF

HIGHER REQUEST ON FULL DAY SLOTS

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.159
AT THE NON ELEAZAR THEN WE CAN

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.927
FIND. TO ILLUSTRATE THE CUTENESS

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.462
OF THIS GAP.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.397

OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED FULL DAY

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.101
FULL YEAR SLIGHTLY -- THOUGHTS

01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:00.803
WHICH WE WOULD NEED ABOUT THIRTY

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.705
THREE MILLION AND NON PROP

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:03.305
NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:07.510
POINT TWO MILLION AVAILABLE.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.745
QUITE A GAP IN THE FUNDING

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.814
AVAILABLE.

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.849
SO WHY AM HAVE THE ELLIE AIDS

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.651
NOT APPLIED FOR THESE FUNDS.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.752
AS WE'VE GONE THREAT WE FEEL

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.487
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR AT LEAST

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.989
OFFER THE FULL DAY FULL YEAR

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:21.557
PROGRAMS FOR SEVERAL REASONS

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.492
INCLUDING THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.026
RATE.

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.661
WE KNOW THAT THAT LOW

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:26.896
REIMBURSEMENT RATE WITH A

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.230
REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR OTHER

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:29.698
PROGRAMS HIGHER THAN OUR

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:30.933
STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.368
ACROSS MOST OF THE STATE.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.136
PROVIDES CHALLENGE US THERE ALSO

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.138
IS AN INCENTIVE AS YOU LOOK AT

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.373
PUTTING TOGETHER TO PART DAY

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.275
pPROGRAMS FIRST IS OFFERING A

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:40.743
FULL DAY PROGRAM.

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.444
ADDITIONALLY ALLEY IS CAN EARN

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.979
MORE FROM SERVINGFOUR YEAR OLDS

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.347
AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.816
THEN THEY CAN IN THE STATE

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:48.751
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.085
THE LACK OF FACILITIES COMES UP

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.854
AS THE BARRIER ALL THE TIME AND

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.689
SO ADDRESSING NOT IN THE BUDGET

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.391
MOVING FORWARD IS KEY AND WE ARE

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:56.892
VERY GRATEFUL TO SEE THAT AS

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.460
PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S CORE.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.329
INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE WE ALSO

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.530
HEAR FROM ELEAZAR THAT THE FULL

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.065
DAY FULL YEAR OPERATIONS ARE

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.900
DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF THEIR

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.735
SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE CLOSE

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:07.403
DURING THE SUMMER.

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:09.305
SO LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE WE

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:10.639
ARE REALLY GREAT FAULT THAT THIS

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.608
PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON EXPANDING

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.710
THE NON ALLEY A COMMUNITY BASED

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:15.611
PROVIDERS.

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:16.779
THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED OVER THE

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.147
YEARS THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.149
TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND SERVICES

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:23.118
pTHOSE SERVICE SAYS.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:24.520
WE ALSO KNOW THAT NOT ONLY A

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.589
PROVIDERS OFTEN CAN OFFER THE

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.724
FULL DAY AT TEN HOURS OR MORE OF

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:31.927
CARE WHICH REALLY ALIGNS WITH

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.963
WHAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:35.798
M. ONE IMPORTANT PART OF ANY

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:38.167
EXPANSION ESPECIALLY THIS ONE IS

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.301
LOOKING AT WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.003
FANS AND PROVIDING ENOUGH

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.838
RESOURCES TO CD E. TO ENSURE

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:43.839
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TICKET

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.374
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.076
PROVIDERS AS THEY APPLY FOR

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.811
FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT EXPANSION.

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:49.812
ONE THING TO REALLY CONSIDER AS

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.213
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH AN

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.282
EXTENSIVE EXPANSION AS HOW WE

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:54.149
MOVE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:55.417
CENTURY WHAT DO WE DO WITH

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.052
ELECTRONIC MONITORING ELECTRONIC

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.187
OR A PHASE.

01:10:58.253 --> 01:10:59.455
COULD BE EASIER ON OUR

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.056
CONTRACTORS AND HELP THEM LEFT

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:02.591
UP AND APPLY FOR THE DOLLARS

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:03.259
MORE IN A MORE STREAMLINED

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:04.159
MANNER.

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.260
WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT FOR

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:07.162
EXISTING CONTRACTORS EXPANDING

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:09.131
IT PROBABLY TAKES THEM SIX TO

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:09.898
TWELVE MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.400
EXPANSION AFTER THEY'VE BEEN

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.135
AWARDED FUNDS THERE'S A LOT

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.570
AROUND HIRING STAFF GETTING

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:15.571
PROGRAM.

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.406
I'VE BEEN GOING FOR BRAND NEW

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:18.607
CONTRACTORS WHO HAVE NEVER

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.275
WORKED WITH THE STATE IT TAKES

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:23.379
LONGER -- PROBABLY BETWEEN

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:24.013
EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:24.947
FOUR MONTHS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'D

ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.423
NEW CONTRACTING AGENCIES WOULD

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.225

REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR STATE

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:55.644
PRESCHOOL.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.712
THIS COULD BE EXPLORED MORE

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:57.780
DEEPLY AND THE STUDIES

01:11:57.846 --> 01:11:59.415

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:26.642
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMóN.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:27.676
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

PRESENTATION I I APPRECIATE THE

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.513
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.150
SPECIFICALLY -- I I HEARD FROM --

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:36.485
THE OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:37.586
OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HOW

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.822
IMPORTANT IT WAS TO CATCH

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.458
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EARLY AND

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.326
SO IN LIGHT OF THAT ARE THERE

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:44.860
ANY.

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:46.829
THOUGHTS OR IDEAS IN TERMS OF

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.897
WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.399
THE WORK FORCE.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:53.902
IS ALSO -- IT TRAINED AND EIGHT

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.538
YOU KNOW STATE WIDE.

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.340
IS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CATCH

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.675
THOSE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS I

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:01.810
THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.312
INTEREST ON THE NUMBER OF SPOTS

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.813
AND CLEARLY THE COMMENTS THAT

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.882
HAVE BEEN MADE -- OUR EVIDENCE

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.016
TO WHY THE NUMBER OF SPOTS ARE

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:11.120
IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO MAKE

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:11.420
SURE THAT.

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:12.821
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.757
LOSE THE FACT THAT.

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.792
THE ISSUE OF QUALITY A CHILD

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.060
CARE GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:19.628
NUMBER OF SPOTS AND WE CAN'T

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.130
JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:23.132
SPOTS WITHOUT ALSO TARGETING

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.200
SOME OF OUR ADDITIONAL VERY

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.969
IMPORTANT GOALS WHICH IS. TO

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:28.337
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HEALTH YOUR

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.772
KIDS THAT WERE CATCHING

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:32.541
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND SO I'M

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:33.075
JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:34.610
COMMENT.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:35.878
STILL YES DEFINITELY AND I THINK

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:36.979
WE'LL GET TO THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.313
IN THE WORK FORCE ITEM A LITTLE

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.948
BIT LATER ON BECAUSE THE WORK

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.216
FORCE IS KEY.

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.618
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT THOSE

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:43.719
ADULTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WITH

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:45.320
THE CHILDREN IN THOSE ADULT

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.522
CHILD INTERACTIONS.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.790
WE APPRECIATE YOU.

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.658
MENTIONING NOT AND THE QUALITY

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.126
OF THE PROGRAM IS ALSO REALLY

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:52.895
COR SUPER THAT CALIFORNIA STATE

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.163
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THEY FOLLOW

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.531
THE TITLE FIVE STANDARDS WERE TO

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.065
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER.

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:57.966
THEY DO NOT REQUIRED

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.701
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OUR HEAD

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.436
START COUNTERPARTS DO REQUIRE

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.438
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AS PART

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:04.540
OF THEIR PROGRAM STANDARDS.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.841
SAID THAT SOMETHING AS WE

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:07.376
CONTINUE TO TRAIN A LYING AT A

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:10.045
STATE LEVEL BETWEEN US -- HEAD

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.547
START AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.282
THE STATE PROGRAMS IT'S

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:14.316
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.951
CONSIDER AS A PIECE OF THAT WE

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.686
DO HAVE IT IN THE QUALITY COUNTS

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:19.121
CALIFORNIA QUALITY RATING

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.189
IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM.

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.757
SAID DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AS

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:23.892
SOMETHING THAT THE EARLY

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.294
EDUCATORS AND FAMILY CHAPTER

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.995
PROVIDERS ARE TRAINED JOHN AS

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:28.497
PART OF THEIR QUEUE CC.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.432
PARTICIPATION AND THEN -- THEY

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.000
GET POINTS AWARDED ON SORT OF

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.168
HOW OFTEN AND HOW THEY'RE DOING

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.937
OF DEVELOPMENTAL SCREEN AND HOW

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.338
THEY'RE TAKING THAT INFORMATION

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:40.809
BACK INTO THE PROGRAM. TO ENSURE

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:41.310
THAT THE BEST SUPPORTING

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:42.911
CHILDREN.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:43.912
SO THEN I MINUTES SAVE SOME OF

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:44.913
MY QUESTIONS AND FOR THE WORK

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.582
FORCE PART OF IT BECAUSE I HAVE

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:50.519
MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE KINDS.

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:53.121
OKAY I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:54.823
OVERALL ISSUE THAT.

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.291
YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS THAT

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.660
PROPOSAL FOR UNIVERSAL.

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.796
PRE K. WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.497
SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:03.699
GOOD ASPIRATIONAL GOAL I I

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.067
SUPPORT THAT.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.536
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THE

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:09.371
NOTION IS THAT WE SHOULD FIND AT

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:12.074
THE MINIMUM ALL EXISTING INCOME

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.343
ELIGIBLE. THREE AND FOUR YEAR

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:17.546
OLDS SO -- WHAT'S NEEDED TO TO

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.348
ACHIEVE THAT THAT GOAL AND AND

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.016
HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE AND

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.385
WHAT ARE THE THE PIECES THAT WE

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:23.819
NEED.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.821
TO PUT IN PLACE. TO TO MAKE THAT

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:27.689
HAPPEN.

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:33.428
FROM HAVING A FINANCED CD E.

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:33.729
[inaudible]

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.831
THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNIVERSAL

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.667
PRESCHOOL PRE K. PLAN IS IS MUCH

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.869
SLOW AND METHODICAL SO THE IDEA

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:44.373
IS TO FIRST FIND THE LOW INCOME

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.141
FOUR YEAR OLDS WHICH WE HAVE

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.876
CALCULATED AT THERE'S AROUND

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:49.011
THIRTY THOUSAND THAT STILL.

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:50.445
DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.848
SERVICES AT ALL SO THE PLAN TO

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:54.483
ROLL THAT OUT BY TEN THOUSAND

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:56.251
SLOTS EACH YEAR IS PART OF THAT

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.886
SLOW AND METHODICAL ROLLOUT OF

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:59.554
GETTING TO UNIVERSAL PRE K..

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:00.188
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.723
ADMINISTRATION IS OUT RIGHT NOW

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.292
IN TERMS OF SERVING THOSE FOUR

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:06.361
YEAR OLDS ON IN THIS BUDGET IN

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:07.829
THE NEXT COUPLE OF BUDGETS.

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:11.900
AND BESIDES THE NUMBER AT SLOTS --

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:12.634
WHAT'S NEEDED FROM THE

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:13.735
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:15.637
KNOW THAT.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.040
AS THE TO PART OF AN MENTIONED.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.609
WE'VE HAD ROUGHLY TWENTY SEVEN

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:21.610
THOUSAND SLOTS PROVIDE IN THE

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.612
LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE I'VE BEEN

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:24.112
WORKING ON THAT IN THE

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.213
SUBCOMMITTEE LAST.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.982
THIS OUR FIFTH YEAR DOING

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.250
WORKING ON THOSE.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.551
A BUDGET INCREASES.

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.720
AND WE'VE HAD SOME LIMITATIONS

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:34.256
WITH ELEAZAR BECAUSE OF RATES

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.624
JUST RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.060
WE'RE FACING THAT BUDGET CRISIS

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:39.962
IN MY HOME DISTRICT HERE AT SAKS

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:40.829
CITY.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:41.430
GRANT HAS ALL KINDS OF OTHER

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.598
ISSUES ABOUT THAT BUT ONE THING

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.200
THAT WE'RE REALIZING.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.537
IS THERE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.305
IS THAT IT WAS BEING SUBSIDIZED

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.907
BY THEIR GENERAL FUND AND THE

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.608
RATE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:56.011
WASN'T VIABLE TO TO TO MAKE IT

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:56.812
WORK.

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:58.080
AND SO THAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.315
THAT THERE PROBABLY ISSUES ALL

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.084
ACROSS THE STATE AS FAR AS OUR

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:04.052
OF OUR OVERALL -- FUNDING TO

01:17:04.119 --> 01:17:05.520
MAKE SURE WE YOU KNOW PAY THE

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.289
WORKERS ADEQUATE WAGES AND

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.157
FOCUSING ON THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:11.259
INCREASES AND CONTRACTS AND

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:13.128
QUALITY ISSUES THAT SOMEONE

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.629
MEMBER LIMO AND TALKED ABOUT SO.

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.365
BESIDES LOTS WHAT NEEDS TO

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:19.735
HAPPEN. TO MAKE -- THOSE SLOTS

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:25.207
VIABLE FOR BOTH ELEAZAR AND CBS.

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:26.274
GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS GIVE

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.443
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK I

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:29.411
ONE OF THE ISSUES ARE AND THAT'S

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.879
ON THE AGENDA AND LATER IS THE

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.714
TREE TO STRATEGIC PLAN THE TEN

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.383
MILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK IN

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.751
THE STATE WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.252
DO IS WE NEED TO HAVE A REALLY

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.254
GOOD NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF WHERE.

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.656
WHERE THE -- HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:42.824
NEED AS AND THEN WE NEED TO

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.860
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.094
WE NEED AS A STAKE IN ORDER TO

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.030
BUILD THE CAPACITY AT THAT LEVEL

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.865
RATES AND IS CERTAINLY PART OF

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:52.000
THAT CONVERSATION -- BUT IT'S

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.368
REALLY A HOLISTIC LOOK.

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:54.836
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ALL THE

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:56.638
DIFFERENT AGENCIES -- THAT NEED

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:58.006
TO COME TOGETHER AND START

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.775
SUPPORTING THESE CHILDREN I'M IN

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.176
WITH REGARD TO PRESCHOOL AGAIN I

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.612
THINK -- WE JUST NEED IS A STATE

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.147
OF PLANNED WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.948
WHERE THE SLOTS WHERE THE

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.350
PRESCHOOL SLOTS ARE NEEDED.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.951
WHAT IT COSTS AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:12.187
IT'S?

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.588
IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER.

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:14.256
I I I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.724
OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS AN ALLEY

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.759
A FROM WEST CONTRA COSTA AND A

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:19.194
CBO.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.996
BUT I THINK THEY WOULD SAY THAT --

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.864
WE WE KIND OF KNOW.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:23.999
BASED UPON IS THOUGHT TO BE

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.068
PUTTING OUT LAST FOR YEARS.

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.135
WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE SO

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.838
WHAT'S THE -- THE APPETITE FOR

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:30.639
THE MINISTRATION IN ADDITION TO

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.441
HAVING THAT A PLAN BECAUSE THE

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.575
PLAN REALLY IS THAT THE

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.377
UNIVERSAL ASPECT AS WELL.

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.012
HOW YOU DO IT NOT JUST FOR ALL

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:40.515
LOW INCOME KIDS BUT ALL -- FOUR

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:41.583
YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:42.484
REVENUE IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.320
THERE BUT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:47.689
WHAT ABOUT -- THE RATE STRUCTURE

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.424
DO WE THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE WITH

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:51.893
THE EXISTING SLOTS THERE'S NEWS

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.096
LOTS PROPOSED MASTERS BUDGET IN

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.331
THE SLOTS WE'VE JUST -- APPROVE

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.700
THE LAST -- TWO BUDGET YEARS

01:18:58.767 --> 01:18:59.601
THREE BUT YEARS.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.569
YOU'RE GONNA HATE THIS ANSWER

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.337
BUT I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:05.607
PROVIDE -- ANY ANY COMMENT ON

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:06.942
THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:08.977
HOWEVER I THINK THIS GOVERNOR

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.579
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.114
VERY CLEAR THAT EARLY LEARNING

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.148
CARE.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:14.516
AND THE SPORTS GIVEN TO YOUNG

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.218
CHILDREN IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:17.819
A HIGH PRIORITY SO I THINK TO

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.488
THAT EXTENT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:20.989
MORE CONVERSATIONS.

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:22.757
OUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD SURE I

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:23.725
THINK THIS IS SOMEWHAT CAM

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.293
PARABLE TO YOU KNOW THE HEALTH

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.028
CARE DEBATE THAT JUST BECAUSE

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.163
YOU GIVE SOMEBODY.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.931
A MEDICAL CARD AND SAY HERE YOU

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:30.799
HAVE HEALTH CARE.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:32.467
UNIT ALONG IF THEY DON'T HAVE.

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.303
THAT A DOCTOR CLINIC TO MAKE

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:39.574
THAT -- WORK IN ITS IT'S HAVE AN

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:40.175
EMPTY PROMISE I'M NOT SAYING

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:40.876
THIS IS EMPTY BUT WE WOULDN'T DO

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.310
THINK ABOUT THE SAME THING WE'VE

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.879
BEEN INCREASING SLOTS AND

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.180
THEY'VE BEEN COMING BACK FROM

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.115
THE ELLIE I ELLIE A SIDE FOR

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:48.950
SEVERAL REASONS AND WE NEED.

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:49.985
TO OWN THAT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.687
IS AND ALSO -- HERE FROM THAT

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.856
FOR THE NOT ONLY A SO WE I THINK

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.491
THAT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT THE

01:19:56.558 --> 01:20:01.096
WHOLE PICTURE THERE AS AS WE GO

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.665
FORWARD -- SO WITH THAT OF MR

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.901
TING.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.035
OR JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I I

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:07.836
THINK IF.

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:08.470
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR NUMBER

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:09.070
YEARS BEEN A MAJOR LEGISLATIVE

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:11.206
PRIORITY AROUND -- PRESCHOOLS IF

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.041
THERE ARE OPEN SLOTS I THINK WE

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.142
DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHETHER THOSE

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:16.111
SLOTS ARE BETTER SHIFTED TO NON

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:19.214
DALY ETS -- WHO SEEM TO HAVE A

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:21.383
LONG WAITING LIST SO IT'S NOT

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.518
IT'S NOT AS IF?

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.554
THE NON ELEAZAR SAYING HOW WE'RE

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.721
WE'RE FINE TOO BUT THEY IN IN

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.790
THEIR COMMUNITIES AT LEAST IN

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.091
THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.493
THE TO TO HAVE A FAIRLY LONG

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.396
WAIT LIST. FOR DEMAND SO AGAIN

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:35.964
IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THE

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.799
SLOTS THAT ARE FUNDED IT TO SIT

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.769
EMPTY -- RATHER THAN TO FIND THE

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.771
WHERE THE NEED IS AND REALLY HOW

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.372
BEST WE CAN SERVICE THAT NEED.

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:49.411
IF IF FOR EXAMPLE IS MISSED

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:49.744
MCCARTY SAID.

PARTICULAR NEED WE DO HAVE TO

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.184
LOOK AT WHAT ELSE ARE OUR

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:59.020
OPTIONS.

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:01.923

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.424

KINDERGARTNERS FIRST GRADE AND

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:42.657
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A SCHOOL

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:44.826
DISTRICTS?

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:47.228
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACT ISSUES

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.237
NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNION.

01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:57.639

WE NEED MOST OF THE SITESARE A

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:16.391
DIFFERENT SITE.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:19.027

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:25.967
SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT THE

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:27.268
BEST THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.570

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:49.290
LOOKING FOR THE SLOTS IS NOT

BECAUSE IT'S NOT NEED THAT BUT

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.895
THAT'S THE MAJOR REASON.

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.963
BUT ISN'T IT A CATCH TWENTY TWO

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.398

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.172
AND HAPPIER DAYS.

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.606
THEN YOU MAY HAVE PARENTS WHO

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.475
SAY WELL ONE MILLION YOU FOR

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:08.276

OLDER SIBLINGS THEY WANT TO GO

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:16.984
ON VACATION.

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.754
SO DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:21.255
ROMANCE IS REALLY LOW.

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.090
THE BILL.

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:23.725
HOLD ON TO THE SPOT BUT THEY'LL

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:25.093

FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.531

DAYCARE.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.398

WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE.

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.211

LEARN AND PARENTS TO EARN.

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:10.131
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.266
WHY WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT --

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.135
ALL OF THIS EXPANSION

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:14.435
[inaudible]

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.437
SO -- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU WANT

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.738

UP.

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:24.145
IN OUR OPINION WE BELIEVE THAT

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:26.680
ALL UP BEFORE WE SERVE EVERY

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:28.382
FOUR YEAR OLD IN THIS STATE.

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.384
WE NEED TO SERVE ALL CHILDREN

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.418
BIRTH THROUGH FIVE WITH THE

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:32.953
PEROT PRIORITY GIVEN TO WORKING

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.255
FAMILIES [inaudible]

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:40.427
OF WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:43.397
CURRENT MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.099
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.700
THE TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS.

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:48.202
ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT OFFER THE

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.737
HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS FOR THE

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.739
CHILDREN WHERE -- RESEARCH TO

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:53.207
SAYING THAT IF CHILDREN ARE IN

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.375
THESE PROGRAMS.

01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:57.011
THEY ARE -- GOING TO BE.

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.512
READY FOR KINDERGARTEN.

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.281
WE STILL DO NEED TO TAKE CARE OF

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:01.782
THE CHILDREN SO PARENTS CAN GO

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:04.652
TO WORK AND SO THE MIX DELIVERY

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:06.086
SYSTEM IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.721
SO AGAIN OUR PRIORITY IS BIRTH

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.323

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.071
THAT THAT'S I THINK IS -- WOULD

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:25.472
BE A CRIME TO OUR TO OUR

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:27.775

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:44.291
POVERTY WAGES THESE PROGRAMS.

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:46.260

ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED ON THE

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.400
BACKS OF THE PROFESSIONAL

BE SPENDING TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:17.391

NECESSARILY ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.289

TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE WE

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.774

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:45.813
OF THE PART DAY PROGRAMS WERE

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:46.547

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:48.215
THOSE CHILDREN ONLY GET THREE

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:50.184
HOURS THEIR BAG OPEN MORE FOR

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:50.751
THE FULL DAY IF YOU IF YOU

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.086
LOOKED AT CHULA VISTA SCHOOL

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:52.886
DISTRICT OR SAN DIEGO AND YOU

01:39:52.953 --> 01:39:54.154

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:56.357
THEY'RE CLOSING THEIR FULL DAY

01:39:56.423 --> 01:39:57.391

THROUGH THE ISSUES SO.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.769
SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SALARIES ARE

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.205
BASED ON CONTRACTS AND THEY HAVE

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:13.640
THE SAME BENEFITS SO I THINK IN

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:14.908
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED THE PACKED.

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:16.343
A CAREER KAREEM IF HE'S STILL

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:18.145

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.012
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.815
BENEFIT PACKAGE AS A NON PROFIT

01:40:21.882 --> 01:40:23.350
AND THE CBO.

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:24.518
LIKE I SAID INSTEAD OF THE

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:27.187
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUBSIDIZING.

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:29.690

FIFTEEN TO TWENTY DOLLARS AN

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:33.794
HOUR WITH NO BENEFITS WAS AT THE

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:34.928
HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THE SCHOOL

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:36.964
DISTRICTS ARE NOT PAYING COSCO

01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.698

MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:56.250
NINE HUNDRED FORTY CALENDAR DAY

NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR THEM BUT

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:21.308
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.277
BUSINESS UP THERE IN IS TO DO

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:23.444

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.588
MORE COST EFFECTIVE -- BUT THEY

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.190

WE I WAS ON THE RATES COMMITTEE.

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:44.031
AND THAT WHITE PAPER REAR

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:46.300
CLEARLY SAYS HOW WE CAN SOLVE

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:48.235
THE RATES ISSUE SO THAT OUR

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:49.937
TEACHERS COULD EVENTUALLY GET TO

01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:52.739
THE SAME LEVEL OF KINDERGARTEN

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.408
SALARIES.

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.343

I NOT MAKE YOU THINK IF HE HAD

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:08.922
THE RATE REFORM WITH THE HIGHER.

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:10.724

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:21.902
FACILITIES READY TO GO.

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.670
LITTLE BIT A RENOVATION AND WE

AND WE HAVE A LONG WAY AT LEAST.

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:40.687
SO I BELIEVE THAT.

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.489
DISTRICTS NEED FULL DAY PROGRAM

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.892
IS JUST A NUMBER OF DAYS AND IF

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:47.294
WE LOOK AT THE LAW THE LAW IT

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.363
SAYS THAT YOU CAN NEGOTIATE.

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:49.897
THE NUMBER OF DAYS YOU CAN

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:50.931

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:52.900
SO INSISTENT ON THOSE TOMORROW

01:42:52.966 --> 01:42:54.268
FOUR TO SIX DAYS.

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:57.304
IT'S IT'S THAT'S WHY SCHOOL

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.872
DISTRICTS ARE NOT LOOKING.

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:03.010
FOR THE CRACKED BECAUSE THERE IS

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:05.679
NO SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT CAN

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:06.580
PROVIDE THAT DOES NOT IN THE

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:08.448
BEST IT CAN PROVIDE HISTORICALLY

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.250

JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TEACHER LIKE

A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER IT DEPENDS

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:19.293
ON YOUR QUALIFICATION BECAUSE

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:21.028
THEY HAVE THEIR CREDENTIAL AND

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:22.563
THEY HAVE THE AC UNITS.

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:23.897
SO THEY'RE HIGHLY PAID THE

01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:25.899
PROBLEM THESE ALL THE MONEY THAT

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:28.235
WE GET FROM THE STATE GOES

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:30.671
TOWARDS SALARIES AND BENEFITS.

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:32.940
AN INDIRECT COSTSO YOU'RE NOT

01:43:33.006 --> 01:43:34.608

YOU'VE BROUGHT UP A LOT OF THE

01:45:04.498 --> 01:45:05.832
BOTH OF YOU AND IN PREVIOUS

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.401
PANEL -- HAVE BROUGHT UP A

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:09.169
NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT GO HAND IN

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:12.039
HAND THE STATE HAS CLEARLY MADE

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.940
AN INVESTMENT -- I GET IT NOT

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:16.476
ENOUGH -- ON THE NUMBER OF SPOTS

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:20.347
BUT WE'VE ALSO NOW IDENTIFIED

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:22.082
THAT THERE'S GREATER SUBSTANTIAL

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.784
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:26.086
HAPPEN IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:28.622
DAY LONG THE TRAINING IS IT

01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:31.091
SYSTEM WIDE OR YOU KNOW -- AND I

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.059
SAID A WORD THAT I ACTUALLY

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.393
DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD EXIST.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.962
IS THERE A SYSTEM -- STRUCTURE

01:45:36.029 --> 01:45:38.532
IN PLACE NOW TO HAVE THE WORK

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:41.468
FORCE HAVE A LARGER STATEWIDE

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:44.204
CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF THESE

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.173
ELEMENTS RELATED TO SPACE.

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:48.842
RELATED TO THE THAT THE

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:50.343
INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:52.279
RELATED TO DAY LONG NOT THE LONG

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.381
THE TRAINING THE WORK FORCE I

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:54.848
MEAN.

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:57.484
I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT.

01:45:57.551 --> 01:46:01.455
WE INVEST IN THE NUMBER OF SPOTS.

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:04.758
AND WE FIND OURSELVES NOW WITH

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.326
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:08.061
ENOUGH PROVIDERS BECAUSE AS

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:09.529
YOU'VE FOR CHILD CARE AS YOU'VE

01:46:09.596 --> 01:46:11.698
SAID.

01:46:11.765 --> 01:46:16.770
COSTCO PAYS MORE -- AND TO WORK

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.805
WITH A LITTLE HUMAN BEING IS

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:23.310
MUCH HARDER -- THEN YOU KNOW.

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:26.213
OTHER JOBS -- IN SO WHAT SYSTEM

01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:28.615
OR STRUCTURE EXIST IS IN PLACE

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:31.885
AT THE MOMENT TO ADDRESS THIS.

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:34.020
WELL I I THINK THE BLUE RIBBON

01:46:34.087 --> 01:46:35.422
COMMISSION JUST CAME OUT WITH A

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:36.456
REPORT THAT.

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:37.958
GIVES US ALL THE ANSWERS ON HOW

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.993
WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.561
INVESTING IN EARLY EDUCATION.

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:43.230
FROM NOW ON THE CURRENT MIX

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:46.533
DELIVERY SYSTEM -- IT IS WORKING

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.201
FOR WORKING FAMILIES EXCEPT FOR

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:50.303
THE FAT AND AND THE TITLE FIVE

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.572
PROGRAMS WHICH WERE BOTH TITLE

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.174
FIVE PROGRAMS A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:57.043
AND CBO -- SO THOSE ARE THE ONES

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.645
THAT ARE ARE EDUCATING THE

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:00.313
CHILDREN.

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.216
THE ISSUE IS -- RATES TO

01:47:03.283 --> 01:47:03.950
INCREASE [inaudible]

01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:06.653
THE WAGES.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.622
OUR STAFF THEY THEY ARE

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:10.290
ACCEPTING LOW WAGES BUT THEY ARE

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:11.625
THEY ARE CREDENTIALED AND

01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:13.493
PROFESSIONAL MANY OF THEM MOST

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.327
OF THEM THE MAJORITY OF MY

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:15.762
TEACHERS HAVE THEIR BACHELOR'S

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:17.330
DEGREES.

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:20.200
SO YES WE DO ANNUAL PAT OF A

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.169
PROFESSIONAL GROWTH -- WE ARE

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:23.703
PART OF THE Q. R. S. SYSTEM

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.739
WHICH IS OF VERY EXCELLENT

01:47:25.806 --> 01:47:28.241
RATING SYSTEM THAT -- IF YOU GET

01:47:28.308 --> 01:47:29.476
TO A FOUR FIVE YOU ARE THAT'S A

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:30.577
QUALITY PROGRAM THAT THESE

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:32.779
CHILDREN ARE IN.

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:34.147
WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT.

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.448
OTHER RESEARCH IS SAYING THEY

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:36.850
NEED TO BE IN.

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:38.618
SO INCREASE IN THE RATES AND

01:47:38.685 --> 01:47:43.056
THEN FACILITIES AND THEN SPOTS.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.125
OKAY WELL FOR ME AS I STILL

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.894
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU GUYS REALLY

01:47:47.961 --> 01:47:48.962
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WE

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:50.130
NEED TO GO.

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:51.932
AND ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IN

01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:53.500
THE FIELD.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.202
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN DOES ME YOU

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:57.237
RECITE CHEESE FROM DOES ASK IN

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:59.172
THE FEW PEOPLE WHO NEED TO

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:01.107
ACTUALLY GO AND MEET WITH PEOPLE

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:02.943
WHO ARE REALLY DOING THE JOB

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:04.311
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:05.645
THE FACTS WHAT'S REALLY

01:48:05.712 --> 01:48:05.946
HAPPENING.

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:07.747
THAT'S AND I THINK YOU RAISE AN

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:09.716
IMPORTANT AT PEACE TO A I KNOW

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:11.017
CERTAINLY THIS YEAR THERE IS A

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.519
CONVERSATION BEING HAD IN THE

01:48:12.586 --> 01:48:15.322
LEGISLATURE -- THROUGH A BILL --

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:17.557
THAT WOULD DO THIS HOW DO WE GET

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:19.192
THE WORK FORCE AT THE TABLE IN A

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:21.361
MORE SYSTEMIC WAY I THINK THAT

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:22.729
AT YOU KNOW WHAT ECHOES IN MY

01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:24.564
MIND IS -- SOMETHING THAT I

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:26.900
THINK WILL BE REPEATED.

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:28.635
ON MORE THAN JUST THIS OCCASION

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:30.203
IN THIS HEARING WHICH IS THAT

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.572
CHILD CARE WORKERS MAKE LESS

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.142
THAN ACOSTA WORKER -- AND I A

01:48:36.209 --> 01:48:37.777
HOPE AND THAT AS WE HAVE THIS

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:41.214
CONVERSATION WE CAN ALSO -- WE

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:43.483
CANNOT IGNORE THAT THE WORK

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.185
FORCE HAS GOT TO BE AT THE TABLE

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:46.887
WE CANNOT IGNORE THAT WE CAN

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:50.190
INVEST ALL KINDS OF MONEY -- IN

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:52.058
SPOTS BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.928
WORK FORCE THAT CAN KEEP UP WITH

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:57.430
THE DEMAND AND THE NEED WE WERE

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:58.999
FAILING OUR KIDS.

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.867
WE ARE FAILURE KIDDING AND SO I

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:02.335
THINK THAT THAT IS --

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:04.271
UNBELIEVABLY IMPORTANT I THINK

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:06.273
WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF REASONS

01:49:06.339 --> 01:49:07.874
THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:10.243
WORK FORCE ITSELF THIS IS ABOUT

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:12.212
WHAT'S GOOD FOR KIDS -- AND WE

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:14.247
HAVE A MAJOR QUESTION IN THE

01:49:14.314 --> 01:49:16.149
LEGISLATURE TO ASK DO WE JUST

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:19.052
WANT CHILD CARE OR DO WE WANT

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.021
THESE KIDS TO BE READY FOR

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.789
KINDERGARTEN AND FOR SCHOOL --

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.257
AND THAT THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:26.393
THING AND THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:49:26.459 --> 01:49:28.495
NOT THE SAME THING -- I THINK WE

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:30.563
ARE CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO DEMAND

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:31.998
A GREATER WHICH IS TO PREPARE

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.600
OUR KIDS FOR KINDERGARTEN AND

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.735
FOR SCHOOL -- AND IN THE ONLY

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.070
WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE SURE

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:38.772
THAT WE HAVE A WORK FORCE THAT'S

01:49:38.838 --> 01:49:40.640
READY THAT'S WILLING THAT AT THE

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:46.579
TABLE TO HELP US.

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:47.981
I DO YOU KNOW SOLVE SOME OF

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:48.615
THESE ISSUES THAT ARE GREATER

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:49.182
THAN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:49.783
WON'T BE ABLE TO COVER ANY

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:50.383
HEARING WE WON'T BE ABLE TO

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:51.618
DETERMINE -- WHAT THE NEEDS ARE

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:54.020
WHAT THE IMPACT LOOKS LIKE

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:55.989
BETWEEN A HALF -- TO FOR THE

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:57.824
FULL DAY -- WITHIN THE REGIONS

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:00.226
OF CALIFORNIA -- SOME YOU KNOW

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:01.728
AS WE HEARD.

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:02.796
I THINK.

01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:04.097
YOU KNOW THE CHAIR BUT THE

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:05.799
EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- TALK

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:07.867
ABOUT THAT THE BIGGEST NEED IS

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:11.638
IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- FOR

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.006
FULL DAY PRESCHOOL A FULL DAY

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.441
KINDERGARTEN.

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:15.475
WE HAVE TO START EVEN BEFORE

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.243
THAT HOW YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:19.412
DOING TO ADDRESS THAT SO I HOPE

01:50:19.479 --> 01:50:20.347
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WILL DO

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.916
THAT -- I I KNOW THAT I FOR ONE

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:23.883
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.452
CONVERSATIONS GO HAND IN HAND

01:50:25.518 --> 01:50:26.987
AND NOT ISOLATE THE

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.455
CONVERSATIONS I'M A BUT THEY

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:29.789
HAVE TO GO HAND IN HAND BECAUSE

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:31.624
IF WE DO AN INVESTMENT AND WE

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:32.926
DON'T HAVE THE WORK FIRST THAT'S

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:33.693
ABLE.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:35.762
AND HAS THE CAPACITY TO KEEP UP

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:37.697
WITH THE DEMAND OR NEED -- I I

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:39.366
DON'T THINK WE ARE SERVING --

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:41.034
THE KIDS THAT CALIFORNIA KIDS

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.469
THAT OUR FUTURE AND THE KIDS

01:50:42.535 --> 01:50:46.306
THAT DESERVE AT TO BE FULL SERVE

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:47.874

ABOUT LEGISLATION BUT THE OTHER

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:06.493

01:57:29.942 --> 01:57:31.277
WORKERS BUT IT'S BUT ARE THE

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:32.545
DATA DO WE DO HAVE IS HARD TO

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:34.414
IDENTIFY THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:35.148
WHERE.

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:37.283
SOME OF THE WORKERS DON'T HAVE

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.551
THE THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

01:57:38.618 --> 01:57:39.819
THAT THIS THIS WHAT ON WHATEVER

01:57:39.886 --> 01:57:42.522
STATE WHATEVER GOAL THE STATE

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:43.556
WOULD WANT TO SET.

01:57:43.623 --> 01:57:44.223
WITH REGARD TO FACILITY

01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:45.124
PROPOSALS WE DON'T HAVE

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:47.193
INFORMATION ON WE DON'T HAVE

ARRANGEMENTS AND THE GREATEST

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:52.398
CHALLENGES THAT PROVIDER SPACE.

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:53.232
AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THE

01:57:53.299 --> 01:57:55.134
GOVERNOR'S -- STRATEGIC PLAN THE

01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:56.135
TEN MILLION PROVIDED FOR

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.870
PLANNING PURPOSES IS DUPLICATIVE

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.372
OF RECENT EFFORTS -- AND

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:00.606
FORTHCOMING EFFORT AND WOULD

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:02.341
LIKELY BE REDUNDANT OF SOME OF

01:58:02.408 --> 01:58:03.943
THE SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.311
CURRENTLY DONE.

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:07.513
OR IN PROGRESS.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.515
MOVING ON THE PAGE FIFTEEN WE

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:11.584
HIGHLIGHT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:14.787
AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE STATE OF

01:58:14.854 --> 01:58:16.122
COULD SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING.

01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:18.291
SO CREATE A NEW A NEW ACCOUNT A

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:19.759
CHILD CARE IMPROVEMENT A COW AND

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.360
THE STATE IN THIS ACCOUNT COULD

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:23.229
PUT MORE OR LESS FUNDING AND

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:25.965
THEN THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION --

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:26.799
AND WE DO SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD

01:58:26.866 --> 01:58:28.100
OF FUNDING THE TEN MILLION

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.402
DOLLAR PLANNING THAT THE STATE

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.071

ONE IS ON BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:35.808
FACILITY ARRANGEMENTS AND THE

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:36.642
OTHER WOULD.

01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:38.511
WOULD BETTER UNDERSTAND A

ELIGIBLE FAMILIES -- AND AND

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.152
THEN ONCE THE STATE HAS BETTER

01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:47.520
INFORMATION WITH THE FORTHCOMING

01:58:47.587 --> 01:58:49.288
INFORMATION ON FROM THE NEEDS

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.723

AS WE DIVE INTO THE WORK FORCE

02:01:29.982 --> 02:01:31.584

THESE TEACHERS MAKE A FRACTION

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:10.556
OF WHAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:12.291

BY INCREASING THE KNOWLEDGE AND

02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:24.270
COMPETENCIES OF THE WORK FORCE.

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:25.438

02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:25.464
PROFESSION AND ACTUALLY IN THE

02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:26.766
RESEARCH THEY SHOW THAT THE

02:03:26.832 --> 02:03:28.701
ADVISER AND THAT VALIDATION WAS

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:29.902
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:30.903
PART.

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:32.872
OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:33.739
SUPPORTS.

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:35.174
HAVING COURSE WORK THAT DEVELOPS

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:37.109
KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES IS

02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:38.611
ALSO KEY SINCE SO MUCH OF

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:39.879
PROGRAM QUALITY DEALS WITH

02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:41.013

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.114
INTERACTIONS.

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:43.749
THAT COURSE WORK NEEDS TO REALLY

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:45.317
INCLUDE A STRONG PRACTICE AND

02:03:45.384 --> 02:03:47.386
SKILL BASE COMPONENT THAT'S BEST

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:48.788
PHONE TO PROMOTE TEACHER

02:03:48.854 --> 02:03:50.556

THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR WITH THE

02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.862
CHILDREN AND THEN RECEIVE

02:03:56.929 --> 02:03:58.597
SPECIFIC FEEDBACK ON THEIR

CHANGING PROVIDER PRACTICE.

02:04:04.103 --> 02:04:05.838
ENSURING LINKED COURSES UNTIL

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.673
ONE OF THE TOP AREAS FOR EARLY

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:08.674
EDUCATORS GETTING THEIR CHILD

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:10.643

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:13.846
IS THAT I'M GENERAL ADD

02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:15.347
REQUIREMENTS ARE MAINLY THE MATH

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:16.816
AND ENGLISH COURSES WE HAVE

02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:18.184
FOUND THAT LINKING MATH OR

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:26.458
STRATEGY FOR HELPING THEM.

02:04:26.525 --> 02:04:27.426
THERE'S ALSO THE POWER OF

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:28.194
COHORTS AND APPRENTICESHIP

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:28.460
PROGRAMS.

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:29.728
AS PART OF EFFORTS CALIFORNIA

02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:31.130
SUPPORTED COURTS IN THE PAST OF

02:04:31.197 --> 02:04:31.864
INDIVIDUALS.

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:33.199
TO ACHIEVE DEGREES WE'VE EVEN

02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:34.934
HAD FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:35.768

PARTICIPATING IN A COHORT

02:04:38.737 --> 02:04:39.572
PROGRAM.

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:40.739
THESE COVERT MODELS HAVE ALSO

02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:42.441
BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED

02:04:42.508 --> 02:04:44.109
INTO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.711
THAT INTEGRATE IN AND BAD HIGHER

EDUCATION COURSE WORK WITH ON

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:48.848
THE JOB TRAINING THAT EARLY

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:51.283
EDUCATORS NEED TO DEVELOP THIS

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:52.218
STRONG COMPETENCIES.

02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:53.452
AND THEN IT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:54.453
THESE -- COURSE WORKS ARE

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.056
AVAILABLE TO A DIVERSE WORKFORCE

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:57.923
CORE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:00.025
CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WE NEED TO

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:01.260
MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPORTS ARE

02:05:01.327 --> 02:05:02.862
AVAILABLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER

02:05:02.928 --> 02:05:04.029
THAN ENGLISH.

02:05:04.096 --> 02:05:05.664
DURING NONTRADITIONAL TIMES AND

ARE HOLDING COMMUNITY LOCATIONS

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.468
ON INCLUDING THEIR WORK SITE OR

02:05:09.535 --> 02:05:10.603
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE RESOURCE

02:05:10.669 --> 02:05:11.737
AND REFERRAL.

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.272
REALLY FOCUSING ON SUPPORTS

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:15.074
AROUND TO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:16.408
HOW TO HAVE INCLUDES A PRACTICE

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:17.176

WHOLE CHILD.

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.518
AS WE LOOK TOWARDS EXPANSION WE

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:28.153
REALLY NOTE THAT WILL HAVE TO DO

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:30.956
SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON THIRTY

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:31.724
THOUSAND NEW CHILDREN IN STATE

02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:32.591
PRESCHOOL.

02:05:32.658 --> 02:05:34.860
AND FINDING OUT WORKFORCE AND

02:05:34.927 --> 02:05:36.695
ENSURING RETENTION THROUGH

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:38.898
ADDRESSING A COMPENSATION REALLY

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.499
IS KEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:42.201
WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:43.836
DATE ON THE WORK FORCE IS NOT AS

02:05:43.903 --> 02:05:45.337
DETAILED AS WE'D LIKE SO WE

02:05:45.404 --> 02:05:46.438
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.140
BUT WE WILL ALSO SAY THE NEEDS

THAT WE CAN DO THINGS RIGHT NOW

02:05:54.446 --> 02:05:55.714
THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

02:05:55.781 --> 02:05:57.516
SPEAKING ABOUT DATA BRINGS US TO

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.418
OUR FINAL PART AT THIS IN NOT TO

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.686
DO ANYTHING YOU ALSO HAVE TO

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:02.021
INVEST IN SOME STATE LEVEL

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:03.188

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:04.990
THE BUILDING OUT DATA SYSTEMS TO

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.458
CAPTURE MORE OF THAT WORK FOR

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:07.826
STATE AT ITS CORE.

STRATEGIES.

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:20.272
AND THEN WORKING WITH A THAT THE

CONCERNS SIMILAR TO THIS FROM

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:37.656
OTHERS AND WE'RE LOOKING -- TO

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:39.057
KIND OF EXPAND SOME OF THE

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:41.326
ACCOUNTABILITY SECTIONS IN THE

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:44.196
COMING MAY REVISION.

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:47.399
LA A A GROUP BROUGHT THE WITH

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:48.533
THE LA -- ARE JUST THAT BECAUSE

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.168
MISERABLE MORGAN -- MENTIONED

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:51.803
EARLIER I THINK THERE ARE SOME --

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:52.404
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SOME

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:54.106
SIMILAR TO THAT YOU COULD USE OF

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:55.641
POTENTIALLY MODELS A BIG PART OF

02:11:55.707 --> 02:11:57.709
IT DEPENDS ON THE FACILITY

02:11:57.776 --> 02:11:58.844
FUNDING IT'S FLEXIBLE SO

02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:59.911
SOMETHING LIKE A RENOVATION

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.280
MIGHT BE SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.547
ADDRESS BUT WE DO HAVE. FOR

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:03.915
EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME OF BOND

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:05.183
FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOL

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.885
CONSTRUCTION I BELIEVE THERE ARE

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:08.387
SOME PROVISIONS THERE THAT -- I

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:09.955
THINK IF THE THE CHARTER SCHOOL

02:12:10.022 --> 02:12:11.657
CLOTHES DOWN TO THAT FACILITY

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:11.957
WITH THAT.

02:12:12.024 --> 02:12:13.258
WOULD BE LIKE A FIRST CALL FOR

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.893
IT TO GO TO THE THE DISTRICT

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.628
THAT THE AND THE NEIGHBOR TO

02:12:16.695 --> 02:12:17.229
THERE MIGHT BE SOME MECHANISM

02:12:17.296 --> 02:12:18.330
THAT THINK THEY'RE DEPENDING ON

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:19.998
THE THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.400
THESE FACILITY FUNDING OR USE WE

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:22.334
MIGHT HAVE TO COME UP WITH.

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:24.136
OTHER MODEL THIS ONE WORKS MORE

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:26.672
IF THE FUNDING IS FOR A NEW SITE --

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:27.906
BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS BUT WE

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:28.940
DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.475
ISSUES THAT YOU'LL WANT.

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:32.010
TO THINK ABOUT AND MAKING SURE

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:32.611
THAT THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:33.679
ENSURE THAT.

02:12:33.745 --> 02:12:35.514
IF A PROVIDERS NO LONGER GOING

02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:36.782
TO OPERATE THE YOU CAN.

02:12:36.848 --> 02:12:38.150
TAKE CONTROL TAKE CONTROL BACK

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:43.889
OF THE FACILITY OR FIND WAYS TO

02:12:43.955 --> 02:12:45.490
GET FROM THE FUNDING.

02:12:45.557 --> 02:12:46.091
YEAH I THINK THAT'S A A GOOD

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:47.025
NOTION I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:48.026
SAME PIECE AS WELL WITH OUR

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:49.227
PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE SURE

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:50.062
SOMETHING DOES GO WRONG.

02:12:50.128 --> 02:12:51.563
THAT IF IT GOES BACK TO THE

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.231
PUBLIC -- ENTITY FOR THE PUBLIC

02:12:53.298 --> 02:12:54.399
GOOD.

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:55.767
I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THAT THE

02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:57.035
THE WORK FORCE.

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:59.204
I THINK AS WE TALKED ABOUT

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:00.105
EARLIER IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN

02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:01.740
THE MULLIN SAID THIS IS YOU KNOW

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:03.442
GREATLY NEEDED. TO TO IMPROVE

02:13:03.508 --> 02:13:05.677
THAT THE QUALITIES THAT

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:07.279
STANDARDS AND EDUCATION.

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:08.880
LEVEL OF OUR WORK FORCE AND

02:13:08.947 --> 02:13:10.515
HOPEFULLY HAND IN HAND WITH THAT

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:11.817
COMES YOU KNOW HIGHER

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:15.287
COMPENSATION -- AND IS IT IS IT

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:16.922
IS IT IS YOUR NOTION TO BE OPEN

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:18.023
ENDED SO.

02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:19.858
SO THIS COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL

02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:22.794
GOING -- TO STRUCTURED PROGRAM

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:25.464
AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR AT CSU

02:13:25.530 --> 02:13:28.834
OR THE COULD BE -- I GET YOU

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:29.334
KNOW IT.

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:30.969
ANON CREDENTIAL PROGRAM IN IN IN

02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:31.837
OTHER TYPE OF WORKFORCE

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:35.674
DEVELOPMENT WHAT SPECIFICALLY --

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:38.110
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND HERE.

02:13:38.176 --> 02:13:39.811
THE WORKFRCE DEVELOPMENT

02:13:39.878 --> 02:13:42.481
DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO HELP CHILD

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:43.115
CARE AND EARLY LEARNING

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:44.449
PROFESSIONALS MOVE ALONG THE

02:13:44.516 --> 02:13:45.717
EXISTING PROFESSIONAL

02:13:45.784 --> 02:13:47.119
DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM.

02:13:47.185 --> 02:13:48.987
SO THAT CAN INCLUDE THOSE TYPES

02:13:49.054 --> 02:13:51.056
OF CLASSES ON THE VARIOUS HIGHER

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:52.557
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.326
WOULD HELP THEM MOVE ALONG.

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.861
THAT CONTINUUM SO IT'S OPEN

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:56.962
ENDED SO THAT IT WOULD

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:58.730
NECESSARILY HAVE TO ENROLL IN

02:13:58.797 --> 02:14:00.098
YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:01.800
HIGHER INSTITUTION THERE CAN BE

02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:02.934
OTHER.

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:04.403
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING

02:14:04.469 --> 02:14:05.937
PROGRAMS THAT ARE.

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.973
STATE WIDER -- REGIONALLY BASE

02:14:08.039 --> 02:14:11.109
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS.

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:13.245
CERTAINLY THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:14.846
THE QUALITY OF PROGRAMS BY

02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:16.782
FOCUSING ON THE WORK FORCE SO

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:18.150
WHATEVER SORT OF TRAINING THAT

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:19.518
THEY WOULD NEED TO HELP THEM

02:14:19.584 --> 02:14:20.886
MOVE ALONG THAT THAT WOULD

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:21.420
QUALIFY.

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:23.288
AND YOU'RE OPEN TO IT GOING TO

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:24.589
THE INDIVIDUAL.

02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:26.792
AND FOR THE ENTITY THAT GETS

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.493
THAT THAT [inaudible]

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.395
STATE CONTRACTS. FOR THE

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:32.297
PROVIDER HOW WOULD THAT WORK

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:33.965
LOGISTICALLY.

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:36.468
THE MONEY GOES OUT IN GRANTS TO

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:37.869
LOCAL PARTNERS AND THEN THE

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.471
LOCAL PARTNERS WILL DETERMINE

02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:41.506
WHICH PROVIDERS AND WITHIN THE

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:42.808
PROVIDERS WHICH INDIVIDUALS

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:43.842
WOULD RECEIVE.

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:46.578
THAT FUNDING IN ORDER TO GET THE

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:48.146
TRAINING THAT THEY NEED.

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:50.482
SO THE PROVIDER COULD GIVE IT TO

02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:51.950
SOMEBODY TO ENROLL IN A

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.585
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:55.687
PROGRAM TO GET THERE.

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.155
THE C. CREDENTIAL AND THEY PAY

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:59.124
THEIR TUITION AB A STIPEND HOW

02:14:59.191 --> 02:15:00.325
THAT ACTUALLY HOW WOULD THAT

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:01.860
WORK I KNOW WE HAVE THE OTHER

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:02.894
PROGRAMS YOU MENTION THAT.

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:06.064
CARES AND AB -- TWO TWELVE ARE

02:15:06.131 --> 02:15:07.299
YOU THINKING ABOUT THE SAME

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:09.067
LINES AS WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.802
IN THE PAST OR WOULD IT BE MORE

02:15:10.869 --> 02:15:12.771
FLEXIBLE NOW.

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:14.606
YES THERE HAVE BEEN.

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:16.141
THERE HAVE BEEN A MULTITUDE OF

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:17.442
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:18.443
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.678
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WE

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:21.513
IMAGINE IT WOULD GO OUT VERY

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:22.781
SIMILARLY.

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:24.850
AND THEN IF IF WE ARE TRYING TO

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:26.051
RAMP UP I KNOW THAT'S THE

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:28.453
GOVERNOR'S DESIRES IN THE NEXT

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.221

FOCUSING ON PRESCHOOL IF WE DO

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:39.598
WANT TO WRAP UP AND SERVE ALL.

02:15:39.664 --> 02:15:42.200
AS YOU SAID EARLIER -- INCOME

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:43.735
ELIGIBLE LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR

DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS ENOUGH

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.208
MONEY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:52.377

02:15:52.444 --> 02:15:53.345
FIVE YEARS.

02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:55.113

IN PLACE TO MAKE THOSE LOFTY

02:16:03.488 --> 02:16:05.023
GOALS A REALITY.

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:07.225
THESE WORKFORCE DOLLARS ARE JUST

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:09.094
ONE PIECE OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.028
THAT HAVE YET TO BE ANSWERED

02:16:10.095 --> 02:16:10.595

WE WILL TAKE THAT INTO

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:18.003
CONSIDERATION THE FUTURE

PARTICULARLY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

02:20:58.683 --> 02:21:00.718
PROVIDING NECESSARY SUPPORT FOR

02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:02.453
STATES WORKING FAMILIES.

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:04.956
HOWEVER FOR WORKING FAMILIES

02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:06.991
CHILD CARE IS AN ACCESSIBLE FOR

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:08.827
MANY WORKING FAMILIES CHILD CARE

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:10.295
IS INACCESSIBLE DIFFICULT TO

02:21:10.361 --> 02:21:13.431
FIND OR SIMPLY TOO EXPENSIVE.

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.033
CALIFORNIA FACES A SEVERE

02:21:15.099 --> 02:21:16.935
SHORTAGE OF CHILD CARE AND LOW

02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:18.403
INCOME WORKING FAMILIES ARE

02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:20.038
IMPACTED BY THIS SHORTAGE THE

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:21.639
MOST.

02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:22.941
RECENT DATA INDICATES AT ONE

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:25.176
POINT EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN ARE

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.945
ELIGIBLE FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:29.814
CHILDCARE BUT DO NOT RECEIVE IT

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.516
DUE TO THE LACK OF ACCESS IN OUR

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:32.617
STATE.

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:35.086
THAT MEANS EIGHT OUT OF NINE

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:37.455
CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.756
SUBSIDIZED CARE ARE NOT

02:21:38.823 --> 02:21:40.558
RECEIVING IT.

COALITION WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:51.128
OF THIRTY FIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:32:51.195 --> 02:32:53.063
EDUCATION ADVOCATES ADVOCACY AND

02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:54.498
SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WERE

CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME CHILDREN

AND FAMILIES AND I THINK YOU'VE

02:33:03.641 --> 02:33:04.975
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT.

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:06.911
WHEN WE HAVE OUR MEETINGS AND

02:33:06.977 --> 02:33:09.246
THERE'S QUITE A QUITE A GROUP?

02:33:09.313 --> 02:33:10.247
THAT WE PULL TOGETHER SO.

02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:11.949
I'M LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WE ARE

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.284
VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE BOLD

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:14.718
INITIATIVES IN THE GOVERNOR'S

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:16.654
BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I THINK IT'S

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.421
VERY CLEAR THAT THIS

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:18.989
ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:20.791
VALUE OF EARLY CARE AND

02:33:20.858 --> 02:33:22.826
EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES -- I'D

02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:23.727
ALSO SAY THAT THEY HAVE

02:33:23.794 --> 02:33:25.930
REFERENCE VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT

02:33:25.996 --> 02:33:28.766
EARLY LEARNING AND CARE IS A TWO

02:33:28.832 --> 02:33:31.001
GENERATION APPROACH PARTICULARLY

02:33:31.068 --> 02:33:32.236
EFFECTIVE WITH FAMILIES WHO ARE

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:33.137
IN POVERTY.

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:35.306
AND ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES CAN

02:33:35.372 --> 02:33:37.107
MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE TO

02:33:37.174 --> 02:33:37.942
THE FAMILY'S LIFE LONG

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:40.077
TRAJECTORY AND THE SUCCESS OF

02:33:40.144 --> 02:33:41.445
THE CHILD IN SCHOOL.

02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:43.747
SO I'M WE REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE

02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:44.848
THAT KIDS DO BETTER WHEN THEIR

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:45.883
FAMILIES DO BETTER AND WE LIKE

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.651
THAT APPROACH SO THAT FITS IN

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:49.553
WITH A LOT OF THE DISCUSSIONS

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.487
THAT WE'VE HAD.

02:33:50.554 --> 02:33:51.822
I'M WE BELIEVE THIS BUDGET

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:53.223
STARTS TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:33:53.290 --> 02:33:55.059
GAP FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR AND

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:56.493
MAKE SMART INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.195
OUR SYSTEM CAN BRING STABILITY

02:33:58.262 --> 02:33:59.663
AND CONTINUITY TO OUR MOST

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:00.898
VULNERABLE FAMILIES.

02:34:00.965 --> 02:34:02.633
WE CONSIDER THIS BUDGET TO BE A

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:03.934
STARTING POINT AND I THINK WE'VE

02:34:04.001 --> 02:34:04.835
BEEN REASSURED BY THE

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.136
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY SEE IT

02:34:06.203 --> 02:34:08.138
THAT WAY TOO SO WE SEE THIS IS A

02:34:08.205 --> 02:34:09.940
A PATH FORWARD.

02:34:10.007 --> 02:34:11.842
AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE REALLY

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:13.877
HAVE PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE CHURCH

02:34:13.944 --> 02:34:15.179
THE WHOLE SYSTEM WHOLE FAMILY

02:34:15.245 --> 02:34:17.281
WHOLE CHILD APPROACH LOOKING AT

02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:18.649
MULTIPLE FACETS THAT WE THINK

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:19.850
ARE IMPORTANT.

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:23.487
AS WE LOOK AT INVESTMENTS IN THE

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:24.188
SYSTEM.

02:34:24.254 --> 02:34:25.923
FIRST AND FOREMOST AS ASSEMBLY

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:27.091
MEMBER GOMEZ REYES ELOQUENTLY

02:34:27.157 --> 02:34:29.426
STATED -- WE'VE GOT A REAL GAP

02:34:29.493 --> 02:34:31.629
IN ACCESS AND IT'S CRITICALLY

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:33.364
IMPORTANT THAT CHILD CARE BE

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:35.733
AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:36.667
THREE WHERE THE UNMET NEED IS

02:34:36.734 --> 02:34:38.035
THE GREATEST AND LARGELY IS

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.069
STILL MISSING.

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:40.838
WE NEED MORE CHILD CARE SPACES

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:42.373
FOR THIS POPULATION TO PROVIDE

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:43.607
IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR WORKING

02:34:43.674 --> 02:34:45.709
FAMILIES AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.444
YOUNGEST CHILDREN RECEIVE A SAFE

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:49.680
AND NURTURING CARE ENVIRONMENT.

02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:51.682
I THINK I'M MANY NUMBERS HAVE

02:34:51.749 --> 02:34:53.017
BEEN THROWN ABOUT BUT THE ONE

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:54.318
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:56.987
MOST IS THE ELIGIBILITY HAVE

02:34:57.054 --> 02:34:58.989
FAMILIES THAT ONLY ONE IN NINE

02:34:59.056 --> 02:35:00.457

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:01.959
RECEIVING SERVICES.

02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:03.527
AND WE REALLY THINK THAT WE

02:35:03.594 --> 02:35:05.062
CAN'T WAIT FOR A PLANNING

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:08.565
PROCESS TO START TO MAKE HEADWAY

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:09.867
ON GETTING SERVICES FOR THOSE

02:35:09.933 --> 02:35:10.968
FAMILIES.

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:13.037
I WE'RE ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON THE

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.304
IDEA OF REIMBURSEMENT RATE

02:35:14.371 --> 02:35:16.006
REFORM I THINK YOU HEARD MANY OF

02:35:16.073 --> 02:35:17.741
THE CONCERNS ABOUT.

02:35:17.808 --> 02:35:23.213
THE COMPLEX AND VARIED A DEAL

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.082
MADE A PAUSE [inaudible]

02:35:25.149 --> 02:35:28.585
NO.

02:35:28.652 --> 02:35:30.521
BY THE POINT BUT YOU GO HEAD

02:35:30.587 --> 02:35:30.721
OKAY.

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:32.556
I'LL KEEP GOING I'M SO I WE'VE

02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:33.157
BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THE

02:35:33.223 --> 02:35:34.558
PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT REFORMING

02:35:34.625 --> 02:35:35.793
THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SYSTEM

02:35:35.859 --> 02:35:38.195
WHICH I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MY

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:39.396
COLLEAGUE AARON GABLE.

02:35:39.463 --> 02:35:40.764
WERE ALSO VERY FOCUSED ON THE

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:41.832
ISSUE OF THE SHORTAGE OF

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:43.600
FACILITIES AND WE KNOW IT'S ONE

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:45.135
OF THE BARRIERS TO DELIVERING AN

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:46.370
EXPANDING ACCESS TO EASY

02:35:46.437 --> 02:35:47.638
PROGRAMS WHICH YOU'VE HEARD

02:35:47.705 --> 02:35:49.006
QUITE A BIT ABOUT.

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:51.041
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT WORK

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:52.910
FORCE AND PRIORITIZING CHILD

02:35:52.976 --> 02:35:54.611
CARE PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS WHO

02:35:54.678 --> 02:35:55.913
PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE

02:35:55.979 --> 02:35:57.181
CHILD'S LIFE.

02:35:57.247 --> 02:35:58.716
I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

02:35:58.782 --> 02:36:00.918
LEARNING IN OUR EARLIER PANELS

02:36:00.984 --> 02:36:02.586
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

02:36:02.653 --> 02:36:03.821
FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN.

02:36:03.887 --> 02:36:06.390
SAFE NURTURING AND CONSISTENT

02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:08.826
PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL AND

02:36:08.892 --> 02:36:09.960
CHILDREN LEARN THROUGH

02:36:10.027 --> 02:36:11.261
RELATIONSHIPS AND THROUGH

02:36:11.328 --> 02:36:12.396
ATTACHMENT.

02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:13.497
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:36:13.564 --> 02:36:15.532
STRENGTHENED THE EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:18.535

02:36:31.381 --> 02:36:32.816

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:34.551

CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA.

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:10.360
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A

02:41:25.308 --> 02:41:27.010
THEN WE HAVE A SECOND SYSTEM

02:41:27.077 --> 02:41:27.477
WHICH IS THE STANDARD

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:29.212

02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:25.362
IT IS KEY TO REMEMBER THAT THE

INCREASED COSTS.

02:43:34.871 --> 02:43:35.872
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:36.940
ADDITIONAL TITLE FIVE

MORE CUTE FOR SCHOOL BASED

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:05.135
PROGRAMS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER

02:44:05.202 --> 02:44:05.835
WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:44:05.902 --> 02:44:07.204
FORCED TO USE THEIR GENERAL FUND

02:44:07.270 --> 02:44:09.639
DOLLARS TO MAKE UP A SHORTFALL

02:44:09.706 --> 02:44:11.274
FOR BASIC OPERATING COSTS.

02:44:11.341 --> 02:44:12.642
SHORTCOMINGS IN THE REGIONAL

02:44:12.709 --> 02:44:15.378
MARKET RATE ALSO EXIST MOST

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:17.647
IMPORTANTLY THE SYSTEM RELIES ON

02:44:17.714 --> 02:44:19.983
HISTORIC SNAPSHOT APPROACH WHICH

02:44:20.050 --> 02:44:22.252
IS ALMOST THREE YEARS OLD BEFORE

NEW SNAPSHOT IS AVAILABLE.

02:44:23.787 --> 02:44:25.388
MAJOR COSTA BUSINESS CHANGES

02:44:25.455 --> 02:44:26.323
SUCH AS RECENT CHANGE THE

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:28.058
MINIMUM WAGE ARE RISING HEALTH

02:44:28.124 --> 02:44:29.993
CARE COSTS ARE UNABLE TO BE

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:33.330
CAPTURED IN SUCH A AN OLD --

02:44:33.396 --> 02:44:34.564
SURVEY SYSTEM.

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:36.533
THE SURVEYS ALSO ALLOW TO

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:38.235
CAPTURE MARKET FAILURE.

02:44:38.301 --> 02:44:39.169
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN DEEP

02:44:39.236 --> 02:44:41.037
POVERTY COMMUNITIES CAN ONLY

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:43.073
CHARGE WITH THEIR MARKET WITH

02:44:43.139 --> 02:44:45.075
THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE ABLE TO PAY.

02:44:45.141 --> 02:44:46.810
THIS MARKET FAILURES AVERAGED

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:48.612
INTO THE SURVEY'S RESULTS.

02:44:48.678 --> 02:44:50.013
SO CALIFORNIA NEEDS A SINGLE

SERVICES THAT ONE COMPENSATES

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.421
ALL TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS FOR

02:44:58.488 --> 02:45:00.357
THE TRUE COST OF PROVIDING CARE.

02:45:00.423 --> 02:45:01.858
WHERE THE SQUEEZE THAT WAS

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:03.493
DISCUSSED EARLIER MY PREVIOUS

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:04.628
PANELISTS?

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:06.329
THE TO RECOGNIZE THE COST OF

PREVENT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

02:45:14.537 --> 02:45:16.406
AND THREE STABILIZE THE ABILITY

02:45:16.473 --> 02:45:17.474
OF THE STATE'S MIXED DELIVERY

02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:19.943

AND EDUCATION SERVICES WOULD ONE

02:45:27.617 --> 02:45:29.152
ENSURE THAT POLICY MAKERS CAN

02:45:29.219 --> 02:45:31.354
BETTER UNDERSTAND CARE FUNDING

02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:32.689
LEVELS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

02:45:32.756 --> 02:45:34.057
I'M NUMBER TO THE PARENT

02:45:34.124 --> 02:45:35.525
COMMUNITY MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THE

02:45:35.592 --> 02:45:36.826
DIFFERENCES IN THE PROGRAMS AND

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:37.994
THEIR OPTIONS.

02:45:38.061 --> 02:45:39.496

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:43.099
THAT THEY MAY WANT ACCESS.

02:45:43.166 --> 02:45:44.434
TO AND THREE THE MIX DELIVERY

02:45:44.501 --> 02:45:46.636
SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED AS ONE

SERVING VARIOUS PROGRAM MISSIONS

02:45:51.174 --> 02:45:52.142
WHICH ARE KEY.

02:45:52.208 --> 02:45:53.677
BUT FUNDING THAT IS ADEQUATE TO

02:45:53.743 --> 02:45:55.211
ACHIEVE THE SHARED SYSTEM

02:46:05.522 --> 02:46:07.357
SIGNIFICANTLY WE CAN LIKE WITH

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:15.999
OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT.

02:46:16.066 --> 02:46:16.633
THE SECOND GRAPHIC YOU HAVE IN

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.468
FRONT OF YOU IS A VERY SIMPLE

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:46.696
THEIR COUNTIES BASE RATE PLUS AN

02:46:46.763 --> 02:46:48.164
ADDITIONAL QUALITY ADJUSTMENT

02:46:48.231 --> 02:46:50.433
FACTOR FOR THEIR INCREASED

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:51.701
REQUIREMENT COST.

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:52.902
OUR GROUP CALCULATED THIS

02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:55.038
ADJUSTMENT FACTOR CONCEPT BASED

02:46:55.105 --> 02:46:56.973
ON THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS THAT

02:46:57.040 --> 02:46:58.775
ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN TITLE

02:46:58.842 --> 02:47:00.009
TWENTY TO ENTITLE.

02:47:00.076 --> 02:47:01.177
FIVE WE BELIEVE THIS CALCULATION

02:47:01.244 --> 02:47:03.079
IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IF WE

02:47:03.146 --> 02:47:04.848
EVER WANT TO CREATE INCENTIVES

02:47:04.914 --> 02:47:06.649
FOR HIGHER STANDARDS FOR ALL

02:47:06.716 --> 02:47:08.985
PROGRAM SETTINGS.

02:47:09.052 --> 02:47:10.820
THE THIRD GRAPHIC YOU HAVE.

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:13.289
THEN EXPLAINS THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:15.191
DESIGN OF OUR PROPOSAL.

02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:16.459
OTHER THAN EXPECT THE STATE TO

02:47:16.526 --> 02:47:18.027
ABSORB THE COST OF THIS NEW RATE

02:47:18.094 --> 02:47:19.662
SYSTEM IN ONE YEAR WE ARE

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:21.464
PROPOSING THAT LIKE WITH A LOCAL

02:47:21.531 --> 02:47:22.732
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:23.700
THE STATE USE THIS NEW

02:47:23.767 --> 02:47:25.769
METHODOLOGY TO CREATE TARGETS

02:47:25.835 --> 02:47:28.004
EACH YEAR BY CONTRACT IN BY

02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:29.672
COUNTY.

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:31.007
THEN EACH YEAR THE BUDGET ACT

02:47:31.074 --> 02:47:32.642
WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS FOR RATE

02:47:32.709 --> 02:47:34.611
INCREASES AS THE LEGISLATURE

02:47:34.677 --> 02:47:36.212
ADMINISTRATION SOFFIT.

02:47:36.279 --> 02:47:37.747
AND THESE INCREASES WILL BE

02:47:37.814 --> 02:47:39.682
DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY TOWARDS

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:41.117
EACH TARGET.

02:47:41.184 --> 02:47:44.421
RATHER THAN A FLAT INCREASE TO

02:47:44.487 --> 02:47:45.355
ALL AS WE CURRENTLY DO WITH COLA.

02:47:45.422 --> 02:47:47.323
THAT MEANS IMPLEMENTATION TOWARD

02:47:47.390 --> 02:47:48.425
THESE NEW RATE TARGETS ARE

02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:49.626
WITHIN THE CONTROL THE BUDGET

02:47:49.692 --> 02:47:51.928
PROCESS EACH YEAR BASED ON

02:47:51.995 --> 02:47:53.062
AVAILABLE RESOURCES.

02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:54.497
THAT ALSO MEANS THAT IN A RATE

02:47:54.564 --> 02:47:56.399
INCREASE HERE COUNTIES WE GET AN

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.168
INCREASE THE DISPROPORTIONATE TO

02:47:58.234 --> 02:47:59.803
THEIR DISTANCE TO THEIR FUNDING

02:47:59.869 --> 02:48:00.737
TARGET.

02:48:00.804 --> 02:48:02.338
THUS HIGH COST COUNTIES WHO

02:48:02.405 --> 02:48:03.840
START MUCH FURTHER AWAY FROM

02:48:03.907 --> 02:48:05.508
THEIR TARGET WE GET A LARGER

02:48:05.575 --> 02:48:06.943
SHARE IN A SINGLE YEAR RATE

02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:08.144
INCREASE THAN THEIR LOWER COST

02:48:08.211 --> 02:48:09.379
COUNTERPARTS.

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:11.981
BUT ALL BOATS WOULD CONTINUE TO

02:48:12.048 --> 02:48:13.316
RISE TOGETHER.

02:48:13.383 --> 02:48:14.584
SO THE FINAL DOCKING YOU HAVE IN

02:48:14.651 --> 02:48:16.019
FRONT OF YOU IS A POLICY ONE

02:48:16.085 --> 02:48:17.887
PAGER WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:19.122
DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS TO

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:21.624
ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN STATUTE.

02:48:21.691 --> 02:48:22.659
THESE CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL

02:48:22.725 --> 02:48:24.494
MARKET RATE DESIGN THE CREATION

02:48:24.561 --> 02:48:26.563
OF NEW TARGETS FOR THE ENTIRE

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:28.031
SINGLE FUNDING SYSTEM WOULD

02:48:28.097 --> 02:48:29.966
REPRESENT TOGETHER THE CHILD

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.034
CARE STABILISATION FORMULA.

02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:35.038

CHILDHOOD DREAM SHATTERED.

I COULDN'T AFFORD CHILDCARE.

02:49:27.123 --> 02:49:28.892
IT MEANS HAVING TO QUIT A SECOND

THE POTENTIAL TO BUILD A CAREER

MAY SLIP FROM ME BECAUSE I CAN'T

02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:41.404
AFFORD CHILDCARE.

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:42.038
BEING ON A WAIT LIST MEANS MEANS

02:49:42.105 --> 02:49:43.473
SPENDING THREE TO FOUR HOURS PER

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:45.842

IT MEANS NOT BEING ABLE TO

AFFORD A RELIABLE CAR IN

02:49:59.222 --> 02:50:00.023

SPEND WITH MY CHILDREN WHO ARE

02:50:06.763 --> 02:50:08.831
MISSING OUT ON MY PRESENCE.

02:50:08.898 --> 02:50:10.166
IT MEANS HAVING TO MISS OUT ON

TO ATTEND IT ON MY LUNCH BREAK.

02:50:21.244 --> 02:50:22.478
IT MEANS LIVING PAYCHECK TO

02:50:22.545 --> 02:50:24.213
PAYCHECK BUT ALSO PUSHING OUT

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.648
SOME BILLS AND CONSTANTLY

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:26.649
WORRYING.

02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:28.017
BEING ON A WAIT LIST HAS MADE ME

02:50:28.084 --> 02:50:29.552
FEEL HOPELESS FRUSTRATED AND

02:50:29.619 --> 02:50:32.121
STRESSED IT MEANS LOSING SLEEP

BECAUSE I'M IN A CONSTANT PANIC.

02:50:33.856 --> 02:50:35.091
NOT KNOWING IS THE HARDEST PILL

02:50:35.158 --> 02:50:36.693
TO SWALLOW TOO MANY OF US

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AND

02:50:43.232 --> 02:50:45.635
HEARD YOU ALL DISCUSSING IT.

02:50:45.702 --> 02:50:46.936
IT LEAVES ME HEARTBROKEN THAT

02:50:47.003 --> 02:50:48.838
THERE'S NO CHILD HERE BEFORE

02:50:48.905 --> 02:50:51.574
YOUR KID IS FOUR YEARS OLD.

02:50:51.641 --> 02:50:53.276
OF THE CHILDREN ON THE WAIT LIST

02:50:53.343 --> 02:50:54.844
86% OF THEM ARE CHILDREN OF

02:50:54.911 --> 02:50:57.013
COLOR MATTHEW IS ONE OF THEM.

02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:59.148
THE ODDS ARE STACKING UP AGAINST

02:50:59.215 --> 02:51:00.750
HIM AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN BOY.

02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:02.085
BUT I AM HERE BECAUSE I DON'T

02:51:02.151 --> 02:51:03.753
WANT HIM TO GET LOST IN THE DATA

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:06.022
AND THE STATISTICS.

02:51:06.089 --> 02:51:07.523
HAVING CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE

02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:08.858
IMPACTS BOTH THE CHILD AND THE

02:51:08.925 --> 02:51:11.060
PARENT FOR MY SON IT WOULD HELP

02:51:11.127 --> 02:51:12.795
HIM TO HAVE ADVANCEMENT

02:51:12.862 --> 02:51:14.030
OPPORTUNITIES ONCE HE STARTS

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:15.064
SCHOOL.

02:51:15.131 --> 02:51:16.265
AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT

02:51:16.332 --> 02:51:18.301
ENHANCES HIS SKILLS AS A PARENT

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:19.669
I WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE

02:51:19.736 --> 02:51:21.170
TIME WITH MY KIDS WITHOUT HAVING

02:51:22.872 --> 02:51:24.374
COMPENSATE FOR CHILDCARE.

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:25.708
IT WOULD HELP ME CATCH UP ON MY

BENEFITS.

02:51:32.048 --> 02:51:34.050
MY EMPLOYER SEES HOW HARD I WORK

02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:35.918

TO SEE HAPPEN AS WELL -- OUR

02:53:27.130 --> 02:53:28.998
HOPE IS THE NAY ADDITION TO THE

CALL OF THIS YEAR THAT THERE CAN

02:53:30.299 --> 02:53:31.868
BE A SIGNIFICANT DOWN PAYMENT

02:53:31.934 --> 02:53:33.136
TOWARDS THIS NEW RATE

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:34.670

CONSIDERATION THE RATE INCREASES

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:47.316
OVER THE PRIOR YEARS THAT IS

02:53:47.383 --> 02:53:47.917

SAW THAT'S HOW SAN FRANCISCO

03:06:08.957 --> 03:06:09.958
CREATE THEIR PROGRAM OVER A

03:06:10.025 --> 03:06:11.560
DECADE AGO.

03:06:11.627 --> 03:06:12.794
WHEN OUR THEN -- GOVERNOR WAS

STATE STEP UP AND DO THIS SO I

03:06:26.808 --> 03:06:28.277
APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S.

03:06:28.343 --> 03:06:30.612
PROPOSAL -- JUST JUST ONE COPY

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:31.747
OUT IS THAT WE'VE KIND OF FIGURE

03:06:31.813 --> 03:06:33.482

THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT

03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:39.555
THAT MODEL AS OPPOSED -- TO

03:06:39.621 --> 03:06:41.356

PLAN GOING FORWARD BUT WITH THAT.

03:06:51.033 --> 03:06:55.203

ONE TIME MONEY IN THE STATE
