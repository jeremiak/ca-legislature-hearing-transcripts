WE WANTED TO GET RIGHT TO WORK TO HEAR THE PROPOSED BUDGET AS WELL AS DISCUSS ALL THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS THAT WE MAY NEED TO BE TAKING THAT OUR EARLY AS WELL AS OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN RESPONSE TO WHAT IS GOING ON REGARDING COVERT. AS WELL AS- A POTENTIAL FEDERAL STIMULUS DOLLARS WHICH COULD BE COMING. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE CONTINUE TO FACE ONGOING CHALLENGES WITH COVERED NINETEEN AND EVEN AS WE ARE ABLE TO- START OUR VACCINATION PROCESS- WE STILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES IN THE MONTHS TO COME. ONE GOOD NEWS THAT WHAT DO YOU. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. MISTER COOPER IF YOU COULD PUT OUR TURN DAY PLEASE. EXACTLY OF. AGAIN WE GOT GOOD NEWS A OUR STATE BUDGET WE DO HAVE. ADDITIONAL ONE TO. READ THAT HAS COME. PRIMARILY DUE TO THE- DEPENDENCE IN TAXES AND HIGH INCOME EARNERS IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE HIGH INCOME EARNERS IN OUR STATE CONTIUE TO HAVE DONE WELL GIVEN THE- STOCK MARKET CONTINUED TO DO WELL SO WE'RE WE HAVE THE STATE. OF THE BENEFICIARIES. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR AND NEXT YEAR NEXT BUDGET YEAR ARE DOING OKAY AND NOW YEARS WE ANTICIPATE POTENTIAL FURTHER DEFICITS. SO THIS MONEY IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ONLY SPENT THE TEXTUALLY ONE TIME AND NOT SPENT ON ON GOING. PROGRAMS WE ALSO WANTED WE WERE ALSO VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR INCORPORATED. MANY OF OUR ASSEMBLY BUDGET BLUEPRINT PRINCIPLES WE HAVE FOUR MAJOR PRINCIPLES TO PRESERVE TO RESPOND TO PROTECT AND TO RECOVER. AND ONE WAS TO REALLY PRESERVE. MUCH OF THE GOOD IN TERMS OF REPAIRING OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AS WELL AS TO PRESERVE MUCH OF THE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION THAT WE MADE OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE LAST GREAT RECESSION. WE ALSO WANTED TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO COVERT NINETEEN DOING SURE THAT THERE WERE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE FAXING DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS SAFE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS. WANT TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES IN OUR STATE. BUT MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING. AS THEY TRY TO STAY OPEN OR BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE. THE WE CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT ALL THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE AND AT THE SAME TIME RECOVERY. WE KNOW THAT COVERED NINETEEN HAS CREATED ECONOMIC DEVASTATION FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE EVICTIONS THAT WE NEED TO PREVENT. WE HAVE- MOM AND POP LANDLORDS THAT ARE. STRUGGLING ON THE POT BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN. WE NEED TO INVEST. IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND WE NEED TO CHANGE CAREERS. SO THESE ARE VERY CRITICAL KEY POINTS WERE GLAD THE GOVERNOR INCORPORATED. MANY OF THESE THEMES IN HIS JANUARY. WE LOOK VERY MUCH FORWARD TO THE HOURS OF DELIBERATION EACH OF THE SUB COMMITTEES.

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER PATTON- I AMERICAN LEADERSHIP DEPUTY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO SPEAK. ON THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND- YOU KNOW THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO SAY THAT- BUT THAT THE TEAM THAT RUNS ACROSS MANY OF THE PROPOSALS IN OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS ONE OF BROAD BASED ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE HAVE A LASER FOCUS ON JOB CREATION. AND EXPANDING PROVIDING AND EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. HARD AT HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE STATE'S UPDATED ECONOMIC PICTURE AND THE OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE MUCH OF WHICH YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT SAGA QUICKLY THROUGH THE SLIDES- MOVING ON THE FLY TO. THE RED HAVE DRAMATICALLY. WE HAVE OUR FORECAST HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION THIS IS UP TO NINE BILLION THE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TWENTY TWENTY. AND- THAT'S 22% SURE SUBAHDAR GREAT OKAY. CALIFORNIA'S GDP TOOK A BIG HEAD IN QUARTER TO- A THIRTY ONE POINT 5% DROP. HOWEVER BY QUARTER THREE THE GDP WAS GOING BACK UP AND IT WAS BACK UP TO TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS. UNEMPLOYMENT HAD PEAKED AT SIXTEEN POINT 4% BACK IN APRIL AND MAY. AND IS NOW BACK IS NOW DOWN TO EIGHT POINT 2% NOW ALL THAT'S HAVE. THREE POINT 9% WAS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PRIOR TO THE RECESSION- ADDITIONALLY I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT THAT THERE ARE FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS STILL RECEIVING YOUR BENEFITS- AND THEY'RE LESS THAN HALF OF THE JOBS THAT WERE LOST AS OF FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR HAVE BEEN RECOVERED. CHECK FLIGHT. SO THE OTHER THE GROWTH HERE REALLY JUST DISPLAYS A SIGNIFICANT STEP THAT HAPPENED IN GDP- THIS WAS EXPERIENCE NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU CAN SEE BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THEN. THE MOVE TO RECOVERY. SO THE OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ROPOSES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN BILLION IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES THAT'S A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND. I'M SURE THE BUDGET MAINTAINS RESILIENCY AND BUILD A STRONG REVENUE ATARI STRONG RESERVE OF TWENTY TWO BILLION. WE HAVE A ONE TIME SURPLUS AT FIFTEEN BILLION. AND WE ALSO PROPOSE PAYING DOWN ON ADDITIONAL RETIREMENT LIABILITIES THREE BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SIX POINT FIVE BILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE ALSO DUE TO THE IMPROVED REVENUE. ARE PROPOSING THAT SCHEDULE PROGRAM SUSPENSIONS BE DELAYED BY A YEAR. SO MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- CHARGING MENTIONED EARLIER THE IMPROVE REVENUE PICTURE IS LARGELY DUE TO THREE FACTORS THE FIRST BEING THAT THE- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WASN'T AS SEVERE AS WAS IT AS AS WAS EXPECTED. AND THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FEDERAL. SALARS THAT WERE PROVIDED EARLY ON IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR. HOWEVER THERE THAT THE SECOND ONE IS PERHAPS THE MOST SURPRISING AN EQUAL SPREAD OF WAGE LOSS THIS IS SIGNIFICANT- WE HAD A LOT OF HIGHWAYS WORKERS THAT WERE ABLE TO HAVE IT AND MOVED TO TELEWORK AND- OTHER JOBS. BUT WE HAD A LOT OF LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. I'M THE HIGHWAY TO WORK. TEND TO PAY MORE INTO. AND SO THAT REALLY BUFFERED THE REVENUE LOSS. TO THE STATE. AND THEIR EARLY WE HAD. A RECORD HIGH STOCK MARKET- PERFORMANCE. AND THAT LED TO INCREASES IN CAPITAL GAINS. THE DIFFERENT POINTS TO DRAW FROM THIS IS THAT THE IMPROVER REVENUE RECESSION. VERY IMPROVED REVENUE. YOU'RE REALLY UNDERSCORES THAT THERE ARE TWO STORIES GOING ON HERE. BASICALLY IT AT OF TWO CONNOR- AND THE BUDGET THAT BUDGET REALLY WORK TO- PRO. INVESTMENTS TO HELP THE MOST IMPACTED. SO WHILE THE FORECASTING REVENUES IN THE BUDGET HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT OPERATING DEFICITS IN THE OUT YEARS YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND- ON. PAGE SIX. YOU CAN SEE I'M THE REVENUE SURPLUS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY OPERATING DEFICIT IN THE OUT YEARS STARTING AT SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND GROWING TO OVER ELEVEN BILLION BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. SO ONE THING I WANNA POINT OUT HERE IS- BEGAN LIMIT IS CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE EXCEEDED BY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- HOWEVER IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT AT THIS POINT. THAT THESE ARE PROJECTIONS AND FINAL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES WILL BE KNOWN IT'S NOT UNTIL THE SPRING. AND AT THAT POINT WE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- ESTIMATES AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE'LL DO THAT AT THE MAY REVISION. SO MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT THE LARGER BUDGET STRUCTURE BEHIND US AS A BACKDROP I'D LIKE TO HAVE A JUST A FEW OF THE BUDGET SIGNIFICANT AND IMMEDIATE ACTION PROPOSALS THERE ARE MANY AND THE SLIDE DECK- ACTUALLY HAD MORE THAN I'LL BE PRESENTING ON TODAY. THE FIRST THE STATE CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THE BUDGET INCLUDES OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AN ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES SINCE THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. AND THESE INCLUDE- EFFORTS AROUND TESTING CONTACT TRACING. VACCINES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT HOUSING FOR HOMELESS AND FOOD BANKS. NEXT SLIDE. SO I REALLY WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS THIS NEXT SLIDE AND THIS NEXT SET OF PROPOSALS OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD THIS IS OUR- IMMEDIATE BUDGET ACTION REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE- THERE ARE FIVE ISSUES HERE AND I JUST WANNA PRESENT QUICKLY ON ON. ON EACH OF THEM SO THAT WE HAVE TWO BILLION ARM PROPOSED FOR SAFELY REOPENING SCHOOLS AND THIS IS REALLY TO PRIORITIZE INS IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE IMPACTS. ON STUDENTS OF THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED. ANOTHER ONE IS THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS IS AT A COST OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. AND THAT THIS IS BASICALLY ONE TIME SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WERE LOOKING AT THE TWENTY NINETEEN E. I. T. C. POPULATION. AS WELL AS THE TWENTY TWENTY- I TEND YETI'S. BUT WE OFFER A SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS THE TABLE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. AND THEN- FEE WAIVERS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED. BY HEALTH AND SAFETY RESTRICTIONS DURING THIS TIME. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE TWO POINT SIX BILLION. FEDERAL RELIEF COMING FROM. THE GOVERNOR OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND THIS NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE BUT IMPLEMENTATION HOW TO GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT. OF ALONG WITH THE AFFECTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION AND- THE EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR BOTH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL MORATORIUM ENDS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH SO THIS IS. AN URGENT MATTER- SEVERAL TIMES I'M GOING TO STOP WITH THAT. AND JUST. PRESS YEAR THE IMPORTANCE URGENCY THAT THE- HAS TO. A THOSE ISSUES ON THAT SIDE. OF THE REMAIN OF THE FIVE REALLY HIGHLY OTHER PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET. OF ISSUES- BOTH THE COST OF HEALTH DOWN SO THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO MORE PEOPLE. AND THE COST OF HOUSING. THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. A ROBUST HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE- SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS. AND INVESTING ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION IN LONG TERM SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN SHORT TERM FIXES. AT AND LASTLY BUDGETING FOR RECORD LOW THE SCHOOL FUNDING TO THE PA NINETY A GUARANTEE. PROPOSES TAX HEAD ON THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND IN INCLUDE MATH HEALTH INVESTMENTS. SEVEN SUMMER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTS IN JOBS AND A BROAD BASED RECOVERY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU AGAIN MY COLLEAGUES ARE ONLINE I'M I'M HERE BECAUSE I WAS HAVING SOME WEBEX ISSUES BUT HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AT THE RIGHT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE L. A. O. WHO IS ON HIS WAY OVER HERE. SO LET ME JUST- GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY ANY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS- DR WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR I JUST SAW SOMECOMMENTS AND JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS- IN THIS BUDGET YEAR IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY CHALLENGING FOR US THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LIVES AND THE ECONOMIC HARM AT THE CORPORATE BUYERS HAS BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY- HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING. AND TO BRING THESE THINGS BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE AND ADDRESS INADEQUACIES THAT HAVE LONG EXISTED EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MAKE THIS YEAR VERY DIFFICULT. GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT A WIDE RANGING BUDGET AS AS WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO DO WITH FUNDING FOR HUNDREDS OF IMPORTANT ISSUES ALL WORTHWHILE. OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GIVE SOMETHING TO MOST. BUT THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE I BELIEVE IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER. AND ENSURE THAT OUR PRIORITIES- ARE TARGETED ENOUGH. IN ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A CASCADING OR A WATERFALL EFFECT. AND BY THAT I MEAN WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO pTHAN JUST THAT. AND BE CLEAR ENOUGH TO ME MEANS LESS ABOUT ADDING MORE MONEY TO THE BUDGET BUT MORE ABOUT WHERE WE PUT IT. ADDRESSING THE PANDEMIC IS PARAMOUNT PREVENTING SPREAD AND SPEEDING UP DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINE WILL HELP SAVE LIVES. SAFE WE OPENING SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HURT FINANCIALLY CAN HELP US ALL TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE ALLOW LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS A CHANCE TO REBUILD. AND PROVIDE US WITH THE SERVICES WE NEED WE'VE ALL ENJOYED. ARE WE GIVING ENOUGH. EDUCATION TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR ALL CHILDREN WE'VE ALREADY BEEN HEARING THAT TWO BILLION ISN'T ENOUGH. WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER IS IT FOR BILLION IS IT THREE BILLION. WE'VE GOT TO BE SURE THAT WERE GIVEN ENOUGH. TO GET THE JOB DONE AND NOT ENOUGH JUST TO KIND OF KEEP THINGS GOING. WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THE VIRUS IN THE ENVIRONMENT ARE WE PROVIDING ENOUGH FOR A WHILE BUT WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS FOR THESE FIRES- ON AND- THE CARBON EMISSIONS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. I NOTICED THAT. AND I'LL PREFACE THIS BY SAYING. I THINK MY BAR MENTAL RECORD IS. PRETTY STRONG IN THIS BUILDING. I OWN AN ELECTRIC CAR I LOVE MY ELECTRIC CAR. WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET FOR ELECTRIC CAR INFRASTRUCTURE INCENTIVES. WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. I WONDER IS THAT THE RIGHT NUMBER. THOSE BUSINESSES THE PEOPLE THE RESTAURANTS THE BARS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR THIS COUNTRY FOR THIS STATE AND THIS COUNTRY OVER FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES IN THIS STATE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BUY THE ELECTRIC CARS THAT ARE GOING TO USE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. I JUST WONDER IF THOSE ARE THE RIGHT NUMBERS I REALLY DO. I DON'T THINK I HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I HOPE OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATE. WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US TO KNOW WHAT IS ENOUGH. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE MONEY WE PUT IN PLACE AS- DOES THE JOB. NOT JUST KIND OF DOING THE JOB NOT JUST KIND OF HOPING TO SLIP ALONG. BUT HE'S BE TARGETED SO WE GET THE JOB DONE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS. JUST WHEN GIVING IDEA WALMART WHERE MY MIND IS GOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD- I'M GONNA COME BACK TO YOU MISTER COOPER R. L. A. L. IS HERE I'M GONNA LET. R. L. A. L. SPEAK THEN GO GO BACK TO MEMBERS. YEP THANKS OKAY- MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR. WE CLOSER CLOSER TO THE MIKE OKAY. THANK YOU- MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING OUR OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. MY NAME IS GAY PANIC LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND YOUR STAFF ASKED ME TO PROVIDE A FEW BRIEF OVERVIEW COMMENTS. ON OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SO I WILL DO THAT AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT- IT SOME OF MY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND I HAVE SOME OF MY- STAFF COLLEAGUES AVAILABLE AS WELL. SO THE REMARKS I WILL MAKER OUTLINED BY THE HAND OUT WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE IN YOUR MATERIALS. BUT IT'S ALSO FOR ANYONE ELSE AVAILABLE ELADIO DOT CA DOT GOV. AND- JUST MENTION THAT ALSO WE RELEASED OUR REPORT- ON OUR OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL AND THAT'S AVAILABLE- THAT WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT. OKAY O. MOVING TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT- WE CALCULATED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REFLECTS A FIFTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME REVENUE- URGE. THIS SURPLUS IS LOWER NOTICEABLY LOWER THAN THE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR WINDFALL WE REFER TO- WE ESTIMATED IN OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK. WE DESCRIBED IT AS A WINDFALL BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT HELPED EMPHASIZE THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THIS- A SURPLUS AND ALSO BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THE RESULT OF THE FACT THAT REVENUES DIDN'T PLUNGE IN THE WAY THAT THE BUDGET ACT ASSUME SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT SO MUCH AS THEY HELD CONSTANT AND FOLLOWED THE HISTORIC TREND. THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW SURGE HIGHER THAN THE HISTORIC. IN WITH THAT SAID THE REVENUES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OUR NUMBERS ARE VERY SIMILAR OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF ONLY ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE BUDGET IS QUITE SMALL FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD. GIVEN THAT THE REVENUES ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR YOU MAY. WONDER HOW COULD OUR- ESTIMATE OF THE SURPLUS BE SO DIFFERENT. AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN REASONS FOR THAT. THE FIRST IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES GOVERNING WHEN A DEPOSIT OR A TRUE UP DEPOSIT TO THE STATE'S. RAINY DAY FUND AND DEBT REPAYMENT PROVISIONS OF PROPOSITION TWO IS REQUIRED. UNDER THEIR INTERPRETATION FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS COMES OUT OF THE SURPLUS FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND IT'S NOT THE WAY WE INTERPRET IT ALTHOUGH WE THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTERPRETATION IS CERTAINLY REASONABLE. SECOND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION IN HIGHER- CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE EXPENSES THAN WE HAVE. IN OUR- IN OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK. AND THEN THIRD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- TRENDS IN EXPENDITURES FOR THE STATE'S MAJOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS BASICALLY THE CASELOAD DRIVEN PROGRAMS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABOUT TWO BILLION HIGHER THAN OUR OFFICES. SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN. DRIVERS OF THE DIFFERENCE THE FIGURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE SHOWS HOW WE SEE THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATING THE WINDFALL. THE DARK BARS ARE- BASICALLY THE ALLOCATIONS TO ONE TIME SPENDIG AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THOSE SOME TO- EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION SO THEY MAKE UP A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL- SURPLUS OR WINDFALL- HE HAS ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION WHICH THIS IS NOT SHOWING ON YOUR SIDE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. HERE'S ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE BILLION GOING INTO THE STATE- DISCRETIONARY RESERVE THE SPECIAL PLAN FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OF THE WINDFALL IS USED FOR. REVENUE REDUCTIONS ESSENTIALLY THE BOOK OF THAT IS THE- TAX REFUNDS THAT WOULD GO TO LOW INCOME TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. MANY HAS ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR. ONGOING SPENDING. AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL DEBT AND LIABILITY PAYMENTS. ABOVE WATER REQUIRED. IN THE EXISTING LAW. OKAY SO THEN MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE I'LL TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- PORTION OF THE BUDGET. AND HERE DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE THROUGH ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW SO FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THIS INCREASE IS SUCH THAT THE STATE HAS NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION AVAILABLE FOR NEW SPENDING ON K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. THE WAY THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE THIS. IS HE WOULD ALLOCATE EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION IN ONE TIME SPENDING TO PAY DOWN BALLOT. AND ONCE THAT IS DONE THERE WOULD THERE WOULD STILL BE ABOUT FOUR BILLION AND DEFERRALS LEFT ON THE BOOKS AND- THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT DEFERRALS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN THE JUNE- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PLAN. THEN IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR IS REQUESTING- THE SIX POINT SIX BILLION IN ONE TIME GRANT FUNDING FOR FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TWO BILLION OF THIS WOULD BE FOR THE INCENTIVE. FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO RESUME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND THEN FOUR POINT SIX BILLION WOULD BE FOR GRANTS TO PROVIDE AN EXPANDED ACADEMIC- PROGRAM PARTICULARLY GEARED FOR THE DISADVANTAGED OR HIGHER NEED STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THEN LAST THERE'S- TWO POINT TWO BILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING. THIS WOULD COVER THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. OVERALL WE WOULD SAY THAT THIS PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE IS. REALLY REFLECTS A REASONABLE MIX OF ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING SPENDING. YOU WOULD NOTE THAT WITH THE EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION AND SIX POINT SIX BILLION GOING TOWARD ONE TIME PURPOSES IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- EMPHASIS ON ONE TIME WHICH WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE- THAT PROVIDES A CUSHION FOR THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BUDGET GOING FORWARD IN THE EVENT THERE IS. VOLATILITY IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE- ANY FUTURE REDUCTIONS. WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO IMPACT SCHOOL PROGRAMS. IF THEY'RE NOT BILL TEN THROUGH NEW ONGOING SPENDING. AND THEN JUST SHIFTING TO PAGE THREE. ALL I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS DEVELOPED PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE. AND SO IN LIGHT OF THIS WE OFFER TWO OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL LIKELY WANT TO DETERMINE HOW TO BEST ALLOCATE STATE RESOURCES TO THOSE THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. THE RECEIVING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN- WE DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE THAT EFFORT WHICH IS REALLY THE SECOND POINT IS WELL WHICH IS THAT IN GENERAL WE WILL. WE THINK THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO EMPHASIZE STATE INITIATIVE NAY SHOULD IS THERE A COMPLEMENT RATHER THAN A DUPLICATION OF THE FEDERAL EFFORTS- WAIT NOTABLE ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL. IS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS ASKING FOR NEARLY THIRTEEN BILLION AND IMMEDIATE AND FOR EARLY ACTION. RUBLE I'LL START WITH THE IMMEDIATE ACTION BY WHICH HE'S ASKING FOR YOUR APPROVAL WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS- THE FIRST SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE THE FIRST IS THIS A PROPOSAL FOR- TWO BILLION INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS TO. RESUME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. OUR CONCERN REALLY IS MORE WITH THE- THE BILITY OF THE DISTRICT TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDS. AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THEY COULD YOU KNOW MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN A SHORT TIME FRAME. AND I MEAN REALLY WHAT OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DISSUADE DISTRICTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MEET THE- REQUIREMENTS SO. THAT IS THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THAT. AND THEN ON THE- TAX REFUNDS FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IN THE RECENT FEDERAL PACKAGE THERE WAS- THE APPROVAL OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR STIMULUS CHECKS FOR MOST TAXPAYERS. BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT AND SO- WE OFFER SOME AS ONE ALTERNATIVE WEIGHT IDEAS IN OUR REPORT. OR HOW THE STATE MIGHT- BETTER TARGET THE USE OF THIS TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO- TO PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT. BENEFICIARIES OF THAT FEDERAL- PROGRAM. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFITS ASSISTANCE PROPOSALS AND OF THE VARIOUS FEE WAIVERS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE ACTUALLY WE GENERALLY THINK THESE ARE WORTH CONSIDERING THEY ARE GENERALLY REASONABLE- PROPOSALS- THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE FRAMEWORK- WHEN IT COMES TO THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION IN EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS THIS IS A SLIGHTLY LONGER TIME FRAME YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO CONSIDER THESE PROPOSALS AND SO. IN LIGHT OF THAT WHAT WE OFFER HERE IS WE AS TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION REALLY. A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THESE. I SPECIFICALLY WERE SUGGESTING THAT YOU KNOW ASK IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING- IS THERE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF A DIRECT PANDEMIC RELATED PROBLEM THAT'S ONE ONE QUESTION. SECOND IS THE PROPOSAL ITSELF REALLY THAT TIME SENSITIVE WORK IS ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT IS BEING REQUESTED TIME SENSITIVE MAYBE PART OF IT COULD BE PROVIDED IN. PART OF IT LATER. AND THEN FINALLY IS THERE AT IN PLACE AT THIS- FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCCESS OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING FOR. SO THAT THAT FIRM HOW WE WOULD SUGGEST- PROCEEDING ON THOSE. AT THIS TIME AND THEN- JUST IN GENERAL LEAVE AT THE CLOSING THOUGHT ON- THIS SO THE QUESTION OF BUDGET WAS. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED- ALTHOUGH THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR HAS TURNED OUT TO BE IN MUCH BETTER PHYSICAL CONDITION THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED BEFORE THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL PRESSURES IN THE OUT YEARS. AND UP BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THAT YOU WILL WANT TO CONSIDER- CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND THE GOVERNOR MAKES AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU KNOW TO THE RAINY DAY FUND AS I SAID. AND SOME OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL BUT BECAUSE THERE IS STILL THIS A PRETTY SIZEABLE- OPERATING DEBT IN THE FUTURE YEARS I THINK THIS IS JUST GONNA BE SOMETHING YOU'LL WANT TO CONSIDER- THROUGHOUT THE- NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS IF YOU WEIGH THE- THE- VARIOUS PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR. SO YOU WITH THAT WE CAN- MOVED TO QUESTION IF YOU HAVE AN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PETTIT GOING TO GO TO MISTER. COOPER IN THE MYSTERY. I THOUGHT OF ALL OF MATURITY FIRST OF AS FOR BY DR WE COMMON IN. IT IS THE- THAT WRIST ONE POINT BILL. ON THE FUTURE STATION IN THE SAN. AND ONLY INTO SEVEN MIL ON GRAY FOR SOME BUSINESS ACROSS THE- AND IN BIGGEST IS YOU LOOK AT IT- WITH ERP MONEY TO GONNA THIS. A WE'VE BEEN A TON OF MY- OVER THE YEARS. AND WHEN WE GOT MY RIGHT. AND THE ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE FOR FINE. THE INCENTIVES OF THE FOR THE PURCHASE OF MORE V. AND I MY ISSUE IS REPEAT PEOPLE BY VEHICLE LET YOU. THAT WE HAVE IN THE- THREE IN THEIR CAR THAT ARE HOME. THAT HAVE. NO PLACE TO LIVE. MISLEADING CARS WATER IS THAT WE YOU'RE PAYING FOR MONTHLY IN THEIR CAR WE'RE SLIP IN THE CAR BEING FORCED TO. THEY WERE PAYING FOR LETTER VEHICLES THAT THAT'S TOLD INSANE. THE COST LIVE CALIFORNIA'S FOR ALL. WILL ERRORS OR VOTERS AND CAN. AND IS THIS TOUGH RIGHT NOW NOW YOU ASK. THE CLIMATE. RIGHT INCOME CHANGE. YES THE AVERAGE PER. WHAT OTHER ISSUES RIGHT NOW. A PAIN THAT MAY. PAYING THAT RATE. PENNY CHILLED BILL. PUT FOOD IN THE- AND THIS IS THE CERVI RIGHT NOW. NO ONE'S THINKING ABOUT ALLEGED. SO IT UP THAT'S UP THAT REALLY. CONCERN ME AND A SOME WAY IT IS TELL DEAF RIGHT NOW. TO THE CITIZENS OF CAL- IT. HAS INDICATED MEMBERS OF APPROVED. THAT PROMOTED BY THE MINISTRY. MEDIA CHARGES TO BY EIGHT TIME. WHAT WE HAVE. JUST A SUPPORT FILE MILLION ALLEGED. MUCH LESS THE FORTY NEW NEED TO OUR TO POPULAR. THINK ABOUT THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AGE CAL. FORTY YEARS OLD. SO HALF ALL THE CARS ARE FOURTEEN OR OLDER. PEOPLE DIE HAVE CARPET BECAUSE THE AFFORD CARPET. THE DON'T WANT PAYMENT. IN HERE WE ARE. GONNA FOR AND EVEN ON THE NECK FORTY. E. V. AS MORRIS. SO BOTH GOOD TO THINK DOING THAT WHAT IS A REALLY GOOD A IN THE END. OF THIS YEAR FOR JANUARY FIRST BECAUSE OF A PASS BY. A LOT OF ARE A LOT OF FLEETS FOR LIKE UPS OF. HAD TO GET OF THEIR THEIR TRUCK BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A LONG GETTING. PER CAR BROUGH. BUT YEAH. THOSE TRUCK BE USED ANYWHERE ELSE. IN THE- IN THE WORLD. SO I GUESS MIKE IS THE END. ON KELLER BUSINESS INTERESTS BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING. BECAUSE OF THAT. IT'S CRAZY USE IT. BUT IT CAN BE USED IN THE ELSE. AND ALSO ARE BEING SHIPPED RIGHT NOT A- CAN BE DRIVEN. THERE TO BE SHIPPED. OTHER CHARGING IT WAS STRUCK ALSO AN ISSUE- IF IT HAD IS. THIS YOUR VEHICLE FLEE. AND COST TENS BILLIONS OF- WE DON'T A PLAN FOR. ALL THE LETTER J. REYES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO- THE L. A. O. CAN. SPENT TAX SPENT MORE THAN SEVEN. DURING THE PASS DECADE. TO PROMOTE THEMSELVES MILLION. DESPITE THAT WE ONLY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND REALLY HAVE A MILLION. THERE WAS ON THE ROAD. THAT MAKES NO SENSE AND WHEN YOU REALLY DRILL DOWN TO IT- CVR P. CASSIDY READ PROGRAM IS THAT IF FOR OVER TWO YEARS. IF YOU LOOK AT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE YOU'RE- PLEASE PROBLEM IS THE WORST BECAUSE THE- NOT TRAP IT. THEY'VE GOT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF REBATES WHERE IS THE WELL COMMUNITIES ON THE CALL COMMUNITIES IN BAY AREA HAS GOTTEN MAJORITY OF THE EV'S THE REBATES FREEBIES AND WHAT TO GET IT SO YOU CAN DRIVE THE CAR PULLING. SO YOU CAN DRIVE THE CAR PULLING A FEW YEARS AGO WE PASSED A BILL TO GIVE MORE STICKERS. FOR FOLKS TO DRIVING A CAR PULLING WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORKING FAMILIES THE DOWNTRODDEN. WE'RE **** THEM. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY **** ON NO IF ANDS OR BUTS ABOUT IT AND JUST A LOVELY THIS ONE LAST THING HOPEFULLY FINANCE CONSUMER QUESTION. WHAT ARE THE INCENTIVES MEAN WHAT IT INCLUDE- SWEEPING YOUR CAR AGAIN PAID TO BUY A CAR. WHO CAN STAND UP AND JUSTIFY THAT I KNOW I CAN'T. THANK YOU MR GRUBER- LET ME JUST SAY THAT ONE REASON THAT THE PACKAGES IN HERE IS TO ADDRESS AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE AS I SAID EARLIER- AN UNDERLYING THEME OF THE BUDGET IS REALLY JOB CREATION AND THAT THE BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR SECURED OF. SECURITIZATION IS TO CONSTRUCT- YOU STATION. A NEW FUELING STATIONS SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S A PARTICULAR REASON FOR THAT ONE AND ALSO- A PORTION OF THAT IS GOING TO BE ASKED FOR THROUGH EARLY ACTION- IN REGARDS TO THE SUBSIDIES- FOR UNDER SIXTY FIVE MILLION OF THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION PACKAGE IS GOING TO. PLUS UP OF EXISTING PROGRAMS TO GET MORE PEOPLE- INTO CLEANER VEHICLES AND- AGREED THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY THINGS- THAT WE COULD BE FUNDING A LOT OF. VERY GOOD THINGS THAT COULD BE FUNDING AND THIS IS ONE PART OF THE PLAN TO GET MORE JOBS MORE PEOPLE ON THE JOB- DURING THE KANEMI AND I'VE OF WILL PASS. IT OVER TO- MY COLLEAGUES AT FINE THEY HAVE ELSE ADD. JUST WILL BE MISTRESS CONSIDERS- RIGHT NOW NOT. ON THE TOP LIST. FIRST FOR CITIZENS THAT PERSON THAT IS NOT A THERE TALKING FOR MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MORE REBATES. IT'S REALLY ABOUT SERVICE JUST MAKE IT THROUGH THIS HOPE TO HAVE A JOB IN A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. SO I MEAN IT IS- DISTRICT OR HIS TONE. BECAUSE SO MANY IN THE HOMELESS IS OFFICE. AND ENJOY DOWNTOWN I PEOPLE SLEEPING IN A CARS. A I JUST I CAN'T JUSTIFY. PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO INTO THE V. SIGNAL THE CAR PULLING OUT OKAY SILVA ADMINISTRATION LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S WE CAN AND CHANGE PRIORITY. AND ALL ALL- TO THAT WE HAVE ONE FOR SEVEN FIVE BILLION IN THIS BY- AND THAT IS TO GO TOWARD- WHAT WE WOULD CALL FAN OF HOME. SO GETTING PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESS INTO- INTO HOUSE SO IN IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF YOUR WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT'S ALSO IN IN THE GO BUDGET IN ORDER FOR THE BILL THAT A QUESTION ABOUT HOMELESSNESS WE'VE PUT- OBVIOUSLY BUILDINGS DOLLARS. TO ARE HOMELESS EFFORT- A WE SEE AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS THE STREETS AND A BIG OF OUR BACK TO IS MENTAL ILLNESS AND. SUBSTANCE ABUSE IF YOU HAVE A JOB AND HAVE AG THE HOUSE. IT HARD AS HELL TO OFF DRAW. OR DEAL WITH ILL. AND OVER JUST GOT IMPROVING HERE SO. ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. WHAT IS THAT MEAN WHEN YOU GO APRIL. HEALTH NEEDS WHAT WHAT IS THAT DO SPECIFIC. TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE. ILL. YES THANK YOU YEAH SO OF A PART OF THE OF THE HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE THAT. NOT ERICA WAS JUST DISCUSSING- WE'VE PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME CHEN I DON'T FUND. AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEAR PERIOD- FOR DH CS TO ACQUIRE OR REHABILITATE FACILITIES THAT CAN BE USED. FOR LIKE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL AND OTHER SORTS OF- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SERVICES WE BE WORKING WITH THE COUNT ME AS ON THE S. WE INVEST. IN THERE'D BE A MATCHING INTENDED COUNTIES THE BOND IN A LONG RUN- BUTTHE CONCEPT BEING THAT- THIS FACILITY OPPOSITION TO HAVE MORE SERVE BY THE COUNTY LEVEL AND I'D ALSO LIKE THAT- THE- THE EFFORT IS KIND OF- I. COMPLEMENTARY TO THE CALENDAR SHOULD HAVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PATIENTS. OR PROPOSING AGAIN AND IN PARTICULAR. A SERIOUS OPEN SLEEPER. OF THE COMPANY IDEAS TO TRY HELP- MORE IN THE- COMMUNITY AND MORE. AND MARK EFFECTIVE SINCE- IS ABLE FOR TO WORKING WITH. LITTLE SETTLEMENT PROCESS. YOU WILL HAVE BALCONY HERE AND I GUESS MY CONCERN WITH THIS ALL IS- YOU KNOW A OPPORTUNITY IN FROM IN KEPT FOR ALL CLOSELY WITH IT'S COLD AS HELL SEKHEMRE RIGHT NOW IT IS DURING THE WINTER SOLANO FOLKS ARE OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW THE BAREFOOT THERE YOU HAVE IT MUCH CLOTHING AND YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. PARTICIPATION TALK ABOUT. A POSSIBLE CONCERN FOR SOME OF THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE- THEIR LIFE IS A BET ON THE STREET- BETTER GETTING THREE MEALS A DAY AND HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. AND HAVE ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE. AND HOPEFULLY GETTING OFF THAT AT SOME POINT. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT NO ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE THE FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THAT THIS IS ONE TIME MONEY TO TRY AND PUT HIM IN HOUSING. BUT YET A LOT IS FULL TO TURN IT DOWN IF YOU LOOK ON IN TALKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE. THEY DON'T ACCEPT HOUSING BECAUSE OF ADDICTION PROBLEMS AND IT'S HARD AS HELL TO BEAT ADDICTION. WRITTEN DRUGS ALCOHOL VERY ADDICTIVE AND ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTH PORTION SO. TO ME WHAT WE'RE TACKLING IT BUT NOT AT FOR IS A- HOLISTIC APPROACH TO IT SO AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT BECAUSE- WE PUT. A COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT. THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS. AND IT HASN'T PUT A DENT IN THE PROBLEM SO I WOULD HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE A- DEEPER DIVE INTO THAT REALLY CONCENTRATE ON THAT. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME THESE PEOPLE- NEED THE HELP AND THEY CAN'T HELP. THEMSELVES WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM AT SOME POINT. THANK THANK YOU MISTER COOPER MISTRUST. SHARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY APPLAUDING THE GOVERNOR TACKLING SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES OUR STATE IS FACING NOW LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ALSO TO THEY'LL DEVELOP A FINAL BUDGET THE RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATION THAT HAS HIT SO MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE DO TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AND THIS PANDEMIC. AS WE MOVE. TO VOTE ON EARLY ACTION ITEMS AND PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY WE MUST DO SO THROUGH THE LENS OF INCLUSION AND EQUITY. THIS BUDGET RELIES ON THE RESILIENT NATURE OF CALIFORNIANS BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS PROTECTED ENOUGH LIFTED IN TIMES OF CRISIS. GIVEN THAT THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROGRAM LOOKS BANDIT TO THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR KELLY I. T. C. INCLUDING OUR AYE TEMPLE OF FILERS WE MUST ENSURE THAT THAT VITAL DETAIL IS NOT REMOVED FROM THE FINAL BUDGET. THIS BUDGET RECOGNIZES THE IMPACT OF THE BAND THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. THEREFORE WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIND PATHWAYS FOR GRANTS LOAN PROGRAMS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO NOT ONLY A SISTER SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE RECOVERY BUT ALSO TO GET OUR PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. NOT ONLY REFLECT THE PRIORITIES OF A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES ANOTHER AVENUE FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. INLAND THEIR LIVES INLAND AREAS IN CALIFORNIA SUCH AS MY DISTRICT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY EMISSIONS AND PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WILL NEVER GO AWAY UNLESS WE MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THE PROPOSED INCREASES TO ARBS AND SEE SEIZE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS SEND A SIGNAL TO POLLUTION POLLUTION RIDDEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SUCH AS THE ONES IN MY DISTRICT. THAT THE DEBT THAT THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING CLEAN AIR FOR ALL. I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN TO SEE THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE CECE'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AS WELL. THE NEW PROPOSED FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE OPENS UP AN ADDITIONAL FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED CHILD CARE SERVICE LOTS. HISTORICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA ON WAITING LISTS FOR THE SLOTS. WELL ANY NEW FUNDING IS WELCOME AND WE WILL MAKE UP AND WILL MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF FAMILIES THE BENEFIT WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN STILL ON THE WAITING LIST. FOR THIS CHILD CARE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROTECT HOUSING POLICIES AS WELL AS ENSURE OUR EDUCATION EFFORTS. THE GIVE OUR CHILDREN THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE INTO OUR CLASSROOMS. AMONG OTHER EFFORTS. AT THE FOREFRONT HOWEVER IS THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY THIS PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US ALL BUT FOR NOW. MEMBERS WE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO BRING AN END TO THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WHILE PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK WE TO HELP OUR SMALL BUSINESSES MONEY TO HELP OUR STUDENTS WITH THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU. IF YOU WERE GONNA GO TO MR GALLAGHER AND THEN THIS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK THEY WERE DOING HERE AND ESPECIALLY WITH THESE EARLY ACTION PROPOSALS I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE. REALLY NEED TO TAKE SOME URGENT ACTION TO LOOK AT THESE AND REALLY TO MAKE THEM BETTER BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT. THERE'S A LOT WANTING HERE IN TERMS OF GETTING SPECIFIC TARGETED. APPROACHES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST- I THINK THE L. A. O. MADE A VERY GREAT POINT AND THAT. MANY OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE NOT TARGETED IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE A NEED TO BE MUCH MORE FOCUSED- I DO WANT TO START OFF IS LESS ANYONE SAID DON'T. GIVE ANY COMPLIMENTS TO THE GOVERNOR I DO APPRECIATE. IN THIS BUDGET THAT THERE IS MONEY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES I THINK THE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. AS THE L. L. L. A. O. SAID IS VERY MUCH WORTH CONSIDERING THE FEE WAIVERS. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO WITH MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING. TO HOP HAVE HAVE THEM BE FORCED TO PAY FEES WHEN THEY'VE BEEN CLOSED DOWN- SEEMS PRETTY UNFAIR TO ME AND IT'S ONLY JUST. I THINK THAT WE DO. THOSE THINGS. ARE LET ME SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- I WILL AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. EARLIER BOTH- MAKE. MY COLD CALLING FROM HEALDSBURG IN MY COLLEAGUE- FROM NOW GROVE. WHO POINTED OUT THAT THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- FOR ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS. COULD VERY MUCH BE SPENT IN OTHER PLACES THEY'RE MUCH MORE PRIORITY- BUT LET ME ALSO ADD TO THAT- THE GOVERNOR IN THIS BUDGET IS SAYING THAT THAT. IS CONSISTENT WITH A POLICY. THAT HAS BEEN SET. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS A POLICY THAT WAS NOT SET BY THIS BODY. BUT A POLICY SET BY THE GOVERNOR THROUGH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. WE DID NOT ESTABLISH THAT POLICY AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. HE IS FUNDING A POLICY THAT HE HIMSELF ESTABLISHED THAT'S A PROBLEM. THAT WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE WE YES WE ESTABLISH THE POLICY. AND WHERE THEY SHOULD BE GOING I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN OUTLINED VERY CLEARLY BY MY COLLEAGUES- THIS IS THE WRONG PLACE. TO SPEND THAT MONEY ESPECIALLY WITH EARLY ACTION MONEY WHERE- WE NEED TO GET THIS TO THE THOSE IN MOST NEED- THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION OF FEDERAL MONEY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT REAL CLEAR WHERE THAT'S GOING BUT WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSING MODE IS LOOKS LIKE A FOCUS NOT ON RENTERS AND SMALL LANDLORDS SMALL LANDLORDS NEED THIS MONEY THE MOST. THEY'RE THE ONES THEY'VE GOT NOTHING. SO FAR WE PASSED THE ADDICTION MORE TWENTY BUT WE DID VERY LITTLE. TO HELP THE SMALL LANDLORDS WHO HAVE BEEN GOING WITHOUT RENT PAYMENTS. MANY ARE VERY STE ARE STRUGGLING THEY'RE GOING THEIR MORTGAGES ARE ARE COMING DUE. OR OR EVEN BEING FORECLOSED UPON. SO I THINK WE SHOULD TARGET THAT MONEY MUCH MORE CLOSELY A SMALL LANDLORDS THE EVICTION MORATORIUM HAS HELPED RUNNERS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO PAY RENT. OR LEASE ONLY A PORTION OF RENT. SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE REALLY TARGETED AT TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST HURT BY THIS BY THAT POLICY OR AT LEAST LEDGE LET'S SEE THE RESEARCH- LET'S SEE THE EVIDENCE OF WHERE THAT MONEY COULD BE. BETTER SPENT BUT THEN YOU PUT ON TOP OF THAT WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT DOING ANOTHER TWO POINT FOUR BILLION. IN A NIGHT THE ITC REFUND. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD POLICY TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE LOWEST INCOME BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS GOING TO THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN AFFECTED OR THE OUT OF WORK. ARE THEY CURRENTLY OUT OF WORK ET DE. IS WERE OUR BIGGEST FOCUS NEEDS TO BE. BUT IN THIS BUDGET. WE ONLY GOT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION. TO PAY INTEREST ON UNITY LOANS US THAT'S ALL OF THE GOVERNOR THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT- WITH REGARD EDIE HOW ABOUT I KNOW HOW BOUT AN OVERHAUL. AND MAKING SURE THE ACTUAL PAYMENTS ARE GETTING OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHERE WE COME INTO THE PICTURE. HE'S LEAVING THIS YOU KNOW TOTALLY BROAD TOLD GRAY AREA WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS MONEY IS GETTING TO THOSE. WHO NEED IT MOST VACCINES THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THIS PROPOSED BUDGET TO GET THE VACCINE OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR US RIGHT NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET HERD IMMUNITY THROUGH A VACCINE WE'RE ONLY PUTTING THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION INTO IT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. THE VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING OUT ARE NOT GIVEN THE ARMS BECAUSE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THIS BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THAT NEXT PHASE NEXT PHASES TEACHERS ONE B. WE SHOULD BE GETTING THAT VACCINE OUT TO TEACHERS AND STAFF RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE CAN OPEN UP SCHOOLS. BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE CAN DO SOME REAL WORK OF PUSHING THAT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE EARLY PROPOSALS. TO GET THE MOST GOOD LET'S GET IT OUT TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED THE MOST WE ALSO WANT TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OPEN WITH THE BIGGEST THING WE CAN DO TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. IS TO GET OUR TEACHERS. AND SUPPORT STAFF VACCINATED. SO THEY CAN OPEN UP SAFELY. AND THEN I AM WITH EDUCATION- YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL ON A AND I'M HEARING FROM BOTH LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS INCENTIVE GRANT PROPOSAL IS TO BURDENS AND EVERYBODY IS SAYING THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE BEING LAID OUT IN HERE. SO YOU GET- YEAH WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THIS EXTRA MONEY BUT NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE CRITERION THE REQUIREMENTS TO REOPEN THEIR SCHOOLS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THIS ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENT AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK TO CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. I THOUGHT WE DID AWAY WITH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL. IS GETTING SUPPORT SO THEY CAN STAY OPEN- SO THERE'S SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH HOW THAT IS LAID OUT AND IF. AGAIN IF THAT'S GOING TO BE AN EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL THEN WE SHOULD GET ON IT RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP. OUR SCHOOLS GET REOPENED IF IT'S JUST GOING TO BE OF AN OBSTACLE THAT NOBODY CAN MEET. THAT'S NOT HELPING US. DO THE JOB. UP ONE ONE. HOUR AFTER THE END OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WILD FIRES. I WILL GIVE THE GOVERNOR AGAIN VERY MUCH CREDIT FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS IN THIS BUDGET. OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT THIS THAT IS A POLICY THAT WE ESTABLISHED. THANKFULLY WITH- SB NINE A ONE. HE'S GIVEN US AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION I THINK THAT'S GOOD BUT IS IT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. IT'S NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW IF IT'S NOT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION HOW HOW DO WE KNOW THAT'S A REAL COMMITMENT. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT FRONT LOADING THAT. THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT WERE FACING THEY NEED ATTENTION NOW. WE NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS GOING INTO. FORESTRY MANAGEMENT WHICH REDUCES CARBON. IN WHICH HELPS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY REDUCING THE FUELS HELPS REDUCE THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN A PLAGUE MY COMMUNITY AND MANY OF YEARS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHETHER YOU'VE HAD YOUR COMMUNITIES BURNED DOWN OR YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE SMOKE. WE NEED TO GET ON TOP OF THIS WE NEED TO GET ON TOP OF THE FUEL ISSUE AND I WOULD SAY LET'S FRONT LOAD THAT MONEY. AND GET EVEN MORE BANG OUT OF OUR BOX. BEGAN TO OUR FORCE IN REDUCING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE AND REDUCING CARBON. WE CAN DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IS THAT THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK. IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. SO JUST TO REALLY WORK ON ALL THESE ITEMS. PRECIADO TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I HAVE MY WILL. AND THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISS RIVERS CENTER MYSTERONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I WANT TO START OFF BY ON SOME COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED FUNDING ON HOMELESSNESS AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL PROPOSAL- I'M WHILE I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ON HOMELESSNESS I WANTED TO BRING UP SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION AS WE GO INTO NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. I THINK THE REASON THAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS NOT ADEQUATE IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE TIME- FUNDING AND THE ONE TIME FUNDING OF NATURE OF THESE PROPOSALS RESTRICTS OUR STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS IT DOESN'T ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO PLAN FOR MULTIPLE YEARS WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT NEW ONE TIME INVESTMENTS OUT. OF WILL NOT ADVANCE GREATER COORDINATION OR ADVANCED LEADERSHIP AROUND HOMELESSNESS I'M IN FACT IT'S CREATING NEW PROGRAMS THAT MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND NO WAY TO COORDINATE THESE THESE AGENCIES RESPONSES- ONE TIME FUNDING MEANS THAT THE MONEY CANNOT BE USED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR SERVICES ANY HOUSING BASED SERVICES BUT AS WE ALL KNOW AND HAVE SEEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES ARE VITAL TO END HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA- IF WE CREATE NEW PROGRAMS THAT. WILL POTENTIALLY ONLY LIVE FOR ONE YEAR. ESPITE OF WHAT WE KNOW. THAT THERE WILL BE INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AS YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS. AND WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THAT IS STILL AN ISSUE AND EXACERBATED. BY COVE IT. AB DE I HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL. OF PRO PRO. I WAS CURIOUS IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE THE- LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN OUR STATE ABOUT THE CONCERNS THAT THEY RECENTLY EXPRESSED IN THE STATEMENTS. AND I'M I'M GONNA POP THE QUESTION ON TOO DIFFICULT HOME. THANK YOU. OKAY HI JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE HAVE READ- THE SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT'S LETTER- AND WE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT YES TO- THE SUPERINTENDENTS AS WELL AS THEIR STAFF TO GET BETTER CLARIFICATION ON- ON WHAT THEY ARE IDENTIFYING AS BARRIERS. BECAUSE I'M FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY WERE NOT- NO ONE CONNECTED WITH THEM BEFORE THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT I'M VERY CONCERNED- ABOUT LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE SAFE SCHOOL FOR ALL PROPOSAL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY. OF ESPECIALLY IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND LA SCHOOLS ARE LOW INCOME- AND UNDER REPRESENTED IN OUR STATE. A. N. AND SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BEING ABLE TO MEET. THOSE REQUIREMENTS. YES A ONE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REACHED OUT TO OTHER SUPERINTENDENTS AND THEIR STAFF ON IS THE- THE ASSERTION THAT- THEY WERE NOT AT. WE DIDN'T SEEK OUT THERE- AS- INPUT PRIOR TO CREATING THIS- PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DID RECENTLY DID REACH OUT TO NOT JUST THE SEVEN SUPERINTENDENTS THAT WERE ON THE LIST BUT TO MANY OTHERS AS WELL- SO THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING- HOWEVER AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. LIKE L. A. U. S. T. MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING EQUITY ISSUES. AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES ALLOW FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE IN COUNTIES. THAT HAVE HI AND TRY RATES OF CODE NINE. AND ALLOW THEM TO PART- EVEN IF THEY ARE BY- THE TWENTY EIGHT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND RATE- THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP THEM FROM REOPENING. I'M SO THOSE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FUNDS ARE GENERATED BY ALL EDA BUT MUST BE SPENT. ONLY ON THOSE OF PEOPLES WHO ARE RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN PERSON AND THOSE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON HOMELESS YOUTH FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS DISABILITIES AND THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN IN THE STATE. I'M SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EQUITY BUILT IN IN THOSE WAYS. WELL I HOPE THAT. WELL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSULT WITH THE SCHOOL LARGE SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- ON A REVISED PLAN THANK YOU. YEAH CAN WE ARE LOOK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DELIBERATE HERE IF THE PUBLIC COULD. PLEASE THEIR CAR KEEP THEIR COMMENTS TO THEMSELVES. OKAY THANK THANK YOU MISS REAVIS WAS YOUR WE ARE. YOU DON'T. THANK YOU WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A MYSTERON MOST MYSTICAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR PUTTING ON THIS- BUDGET IN FRONT OF US IN IDENTIFYING SURPLUSES THAT ARE THERE. BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD ALL BE COMFORTABLE I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT. AND I THINK IN OTHER DISTRICTS TO WORK IN A LOT OF CALLS RECENTLY FROM ET DE. R. ET DE IN THE BACKLOG THAT IT CONTINUES TO HAVE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IT'S BEEN GOING ON GOING SO I LIKE TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THAT AREA TO START TO- FREE UP THAT BACKLOG. THAT IS THERE- ALSO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES A GREAT THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING FUNDING AND GRANTS THAT ARE GOING OUT THERE. BUT I HAVE TO ASK WHAT MATRIX IS BEING USED TO IDENTIFY THE TRUE BUSINESSES THAT ARE HAVING THE GREATEST IMPACT. I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT THE HOSPITALITY ASPECT THE RESTAURANTS A SMALL MOM AND POP SHOPS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING. GREATER IMPACTS SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME TYPEOF MATRIX THAT IDENTIFIES THOSE THAT WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT. THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND RECEIVE THE GRANTS ON THEIR ADEQUATELY COVERING THOSE AREAS AND I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT ALSO IN MY DISTRICT. ARE THOSE THAT ARE IN THAT HOSPITALITY AREA ARE THOSE AGAIN THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT THE E. I. T. C. INCOME THAT'S THERE SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT. AS FAR AS WHAT BUSINESSES ARE HAVING THE GREATEST IMPACT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FUNDING- REACHES THOSE THAT ARE CERTAINLY GETTING THAT NONSTOP ON THOSE. TWO QUESTIONS BUT I HAVE A FEW MORE MISTER CHAIR. SURE I IN REGARDS TO THE EDT BACKLOG- AND OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE INUNDATED WITH THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS EARLY ON AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. GETTING GETTING RID OF THAT BACKLOG BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE EXIST A BACKLOG ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE IS TO REDIRECT SOME OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO WORK ON YOU WHY THEY HAVE ALSO HIRED NEW EMPLOYEES- THEY HAVE EXTENDED THEIR HOURS FOR CALL CENTERS EXTENDED THEIR- DAYS AS WELL- TO JUST GET MANPOWER UP THERE THIS IS SOME OF THAT IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. OF NOT A SATISFYING ANSWER IF YOU'RE WAITING AND IF YOU'RE IN THAT COHORT BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO TO ADDRESS THE MASSIVE BACKLOG THAT THEY HAVE- IN REGARDS TO- BUSINESSES I WOULD SAY THAT THE FEE RELIEF IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD PARTICULARLY- CRAFTED AROUND- GIVING SOME OF THE BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED- SOME SOME RELIEF AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE- RESTAURANTS AND BARS AS WELL AS- LICENSEES UNDER- BARBARA BARBER IN COSMETOLOGY SAID. TO BE- TO INTO IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT PROPOSAL IS IN PARTICULARLY VERY TARGETED ON THE BUSINESS GRANT ALSO WILL BE- APPLICATIONS WILL BE COMING IN AND WILL BE- LOOKED AT BASED ON NEED AND IMPACT- IN REGARDS TO- KOBE AS WELL. SO I CAN GET YOU SOME MORE DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THE- FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION IF THAT'S THE- THE QUESTION IN PARTICULAR YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT BUT YES WE ARE. TRYING TO TARGET ANTI- MY OF THOSE THIS THAT HAVE THE MOST AND. WITH THE AND REALLY IT'S THE AT THE LOOK LEVEL IT'S A SALES REVENUE THIS GUY CHEN THE GENERAL. AT THE LAW LEVEL. SO IF WE START. HAVE OUR UNDERSTANDING. IS BEING. SO THOSE. IN WE CAN REACH OUT TO OUR- AREAS TO DARKEN. THAT ARE HAVING TO GO IN. TO START THAT RICK. TO HAPPEN IN THE AREAS THAT WE DRASTICALLY NEED. UP NEXT I LIKE TO MOVE ON TO SCHOOLS NOTHING. THANK YOU FOR IDENTIFYING THE SCHOOLS IN THE NEEDS THAT ARE THERE- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT. DURING THIS TIME IT'S NOT JUST THE ADULTS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH SEVERE. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT'S OUR STUDENTS THAT ALSO CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DEPRESSION ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT WE'VE SEEN- UNSEEN HAPPENED PLAY OUT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN IN THE DISTRICT OF THE ASSEMBLY FORTIETH. IN UP AND SO WHAT RESOURCES ARE THERE FOR THAT MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT. BUT ALSO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOMELESS YOU. THE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION ASSEMBLY NO COUNTY WAS OVER THIRTY THOUSAND- STUDENTS PRIOR TO COALBED NINETEEN NOW WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT HAS INCREASED. BUT YET WHAT RESOURCES ARE WE GIVING THEIR FOR THE HOMELESS YOU. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THIS TIME AND FOR THOSE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE THERE. THAT MANY TIMES MANY TIMES DRIVES IT YOUNG INDIVIDUAL TO START TO CONTEMPLATE. LIFE OR OR DEATH ON THOSE ISSUES AND IT'S  MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM THAT STIGMA. AND REALLY TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY NEED THE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEM. SO IN THE MONEY THAT'S MOVING FORWARD IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. TO THOSE THAT ARE GREATLY IMPACTED BY. YES YOU FOR THAT. AND I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE- FOR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. PROPOSAL MATH HEALTH- FOR STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR. AND THE DAHLE GET THE- FUNDING AND THE PROPOSAL WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WORKING WITH LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OFFICES. AND SCHOOLS TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS SO THAT. CHILDREN WHO ARE HAVING ISSUES CAN BE IDENTIFIED AT SCHOOL AND THEN THEY CAN- RECEIVE PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT. AND- IF ANYTHING THAT BUDGET- DOES HIGHLIGHT THAT THE IMPACT. THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS HAVE HAD BOTH IN SCHOOL- INSTRUCTION SCHOOL INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS IN MENTAL HEALTH. SO AT BACK TO THE ONE ONE- LARGE PROPOSAL I WOULD POINT OUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR STUDENTS. THE THIRTY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE WERE SO. IN GETTING ON OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION SIGNED INTO LAW BUT WE HAVE TO MAKESURE THAT WHEN WE START TO TOPPLE THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW AND DOLLARS GOING BACK INTO THE SCHOOLS. THAT WE START TO UTILIZE THAT COMPONENT THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT IN THE IN THE ECONOMY AND RECOVERY THAT IS NOT JUST DOLLARS AND CENTS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE MENTAL HALTH COMPONENT. OF ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS AT THE FOREFRONT- JUST- ONE MORE QUESTION- MISTER CHAIR. IN THIS DEALS WITH THE VACCINATIONS AND THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE VACCINATIONS THAT ARE IS COMING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THE- THE DELIVERY AND WE SEE IT- MOVIE FORWARD MANY TIMES ON MY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. I SEE FIRSTHAND READING ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER OR DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF VACCINES MOVING FORWARD. BUT STILL- WHEN I ASK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OUR SENIOR POPULATION ARE CALLING MY OFFICE TO FIND OUT WHERE CAN THEY GO TO GET THIS VACCINATION. IS NOW THE MONEY IS BEING PUT INTO THE VACCINATION THE DISBURSEMENT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR DISBURSEMENT WHAT IS THAT RESPONSIBILITY LIE SO WE'RE CLEAR ON RESPONDING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. SURE AND IT HAS THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTED ON FRIDAY ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ISN'T IN RECEIPT OF THE VACCINES- THEY ARE GOING TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE ARE IN COMMUNICATION WITH A LOCAL HOME OFFICES AND- LOCAL PROVIDERS- AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE. ULTIMATELY PROVIDING THOSE VACCINES- I WOULD SAY THAT THE DOLLARS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- THE OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION. IS AN ESTIMATE IS BASED ON- THE THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED AT THE TIME FOR VACCINATION DISTRIBUTION- HOWEVER. THAT IS JUST AN ESTIMATE THOSE ARE EMERGENCY DOLLARS. AND BUDGET WILL PROVIDE WHAT. TO GET THE VACCINE OUT. UNDER THE IMPORT OF ANY MEDIA OF THE VACCINATION. SERVER I'M HERE IN A IT WILL BE A LOCAL WHERE THE JUST FOR PLAN WILL BE- PLANNED OUT AT. YES AND- IT IN TERMS OF FURTHER DETAILS I'M HAPPY TO SET UP A MEETING WITH THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE MEETINGS- TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAIL ON ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BUT ALSO IN THE COMPONENT IF IT'S DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF GETTING THE VACCINATIONS OUT. TO ALL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN EMPHASIS ON MAKING SURE THAT VACCINATIONS REACH. THE- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT FOR MANY YEARS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT OVERLOOKED ANYMORE IN THOSE VACCINATIONS IN THE DISCUSSION THAT TAKES PLACE. REACHES MANY TIMES WITH WHAT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S OUR TRIBAL CALIFORNIA INDIAN COMMUNITIES I'D LIKE TO- GET MORE FOLLOW UP ON THAT MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR- JUST ONE MORE- WITH THE SURPLUS COMING THROUGH- THERE WAS EMPLOYEES MANY THAT HAD TO TAKE A 10% CUT. IS THERE ANY- ANY TO DELIBERATION OR ANY DISCUSSION OF MAKING THOSE EMPLOYEES HOLES SINCE WE DO SEE THAT SURPLUS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHEST MY LAST QUESTION YES THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT PLAN UP I THINK WITH THE IMPROVED REVENUES. IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO REVISIT THAT AND I THINK AS- THE SPRING COMES- AS WE LOOK AT REVENUES IN THE SPRING- WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND CAN APPROACH- ARE BARGAINING UNIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHEN GOING TO GO TO MISTER IN THE MISC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER- BUDGET YEAR AND- ONE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE VERY VERY BUSY AND I WANT TO- WELCOME OUR NEW VICE CHAIR AT THE POINT OF PERSONAL PRIDE FOR ME THAT- IT SEEMS THAT BUDGET SUB THREE IS THE TRAINING GROUND FOR ALL OF THE GREAT. BUDGET COMMITTEE OF VICE CHAIRS WHO. WELCOME ABOARD- WHERE THIS IS A VERY VERY CHALLENGING HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE- INCREASE NEEDS AND DECREASED FUNDING ALBEIT WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING. AND THE PANDEMIC IS CLEARLY THE- MOST CURRENT ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED IN REAL TIME RIGHT NOW BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T HAVE OTHER CRISES THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IS ONGOING HAS BEEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND WE CAN'T FORGET NIGHT OF PRESHEAF THE ROBUST CONVERSATION- AROUND ELECTRIC VEHICLE FUNDING AUTOMOBILE EXHAUST REMAINS THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO CARBON EMISSIONS SO WE HAVE TO TRANSITION OUT OF THIS CARBON ECONOMY AND ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS WE DO IT IS TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE MOVING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HELLO THE BEAR THAT IN MIND AS WE AS WE HAVE- THIS DISCUSSION THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS CONTINUES. RIGHT NOW UNABATED AND AFFECTS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS AND THE GOVERNOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO THEIR CREDIT HAVE PUT TO BED TOGETHER A PACKAGE. THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BUT- ARE JUST BE FRANK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY AND IT'S NOT ON GOING UP WE NEED A PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE REALLY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP. WITH THAT AND FINALLY AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF ALL THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE IN THE STATE BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHERS- BUT- NONE OF US SHOULD FORGET. THAT LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO AND IT'S BEEN MENTIONED- IN THIS AREA- WAS THE WORST FIRE SEASON WE'VE EVER SEEN AND THAT'S AFTER A SERIES OF. WORSENING SEASONS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. UPSELL WILDFIRE PREVENTION WHICH TIES INTO CLIMATE CHANGE- NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT A WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS AND AGAIN AND I THINK- MY FRIEND FROM NICHOLS AND I WILL FIND SOME COMMON GROUND ON THIS- WE NEED. A RELIABLE- AND SUFFICIENT ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS I'LL LEAVE IT THERE I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING DOWN TO WORK IN THE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME AND- A PLEASED TO BE JOINED HERE. BY ALL MY SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND- LET'S GET TO IT. THANK YOU MISTER BLUMENTHAL GLUTINOUS ARE CARILLO AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A RESTAURANT.

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THE STIMULUS PACKAGE TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES HAD BY THE PANDEMIC AND LOW INCOME WORKERS WITH. AN ADDITIONAL STIMULUS. A PAYMENT HOWEVER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REMAINS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN MY DISTRICT OVER THE BREAK. MY STAFF AS WELL AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TOOK HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF CALLS. RELATING TO CONSTITUENTS TYING TO NAVIGATE. THE SYSTEM AND ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS. WHAT RESOURCES ARE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG PREPARE FOR THE EXTENDED THE U. I. BENEFITS IN THE SECOND. FEDERAL STIMULUS AND WHAT STEPS IS THE DEPARTMENT TAKING TO ADDRESS FRAUD SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION ON THE ISSUE. THE SECOND QUESTION RELATING TO HOMELESSNESS. IN THE SECTION ON HOMELESSNESS. ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IT READS ON PAGE. FOR TOO LONG THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE PROVIDED ONLY SHORT TERM MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND HAVE NOT DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. HOW DOES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUTLINED. A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. MY CONCERN AS HAS BEEN SHARED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. IS THAT WE ARE PUTTING ON A VERY EXPENSIVE. BANDAID ON A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE WITHOUT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THE WOUND. A WOUND SO DEEP. THAT REQUIRES US TO THINK ABOUT LONG TERM EFFECTS. TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO TREAT THE WOUNDS OF DRUG ADDICTION. MENTAL HEALTH AFFLICTIONS. AND ADDRESS THE RE INTEGRATION FACT SOCIETY. AND THE REALITY IN NEED THE WORK FORCE NATIONAL. FOR LONG TERM. THAT HAS THE SKILLS VERSUS AND COMPASSION NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS WON'T. HOW DOES THE STATE PLAN TO MAINTAIN THE INVESTMENT MADE IN HOME KEY WITH A ONE TIME FUNDING. IS THE ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR HOME KEY LIMITED TO ACQUISITION OF SITE OR WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ONGOING OPERATING SUBSIDIES THANK YOU. OKAY I'LL TRY TO GET ALL YOUR QUESTIONS LET ME KNOW IF I MISSED ANYTHING- LET'S START WITH- ACTUALLY WE'RE ALL HARD ONE SO LET'S LET'S START WITH EDT- I THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER AT SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT THE DEPARTMENT ATTEMPTED TO DO TO GET MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE U. I. CLAIMS SO I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE BUDGET INCREASES THE RESOURCES FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE U. I. PROGRAM. BY ONE POINT ONE BILLION AND SIX THOUSAND POSITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR- WHICH TOTALS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION AND 1-000-010-0009 HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN POSITIONS- AND SOME OF THOSE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT- ALL OF THEM ARE WORKING ON THE U. S. CLAIMS BUT THERE ARE THERE'S NOT THERE THERE IS A RESOURCE FAIR JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS- PROVIDE ONE POINT ONE BILLION EIGHT THOUSAND POSITIONS IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR- AND THESE POSITIONS ARE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU I CLAIMS PROCESSING AND- AND FRAUD PREVENTION SO YOU ASKED ABOUT FRAUD- A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD SAY IS. WHEN- B. THE LARGE THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FRAUD WAS. FOUND IN PROBABLY IN JULY JUNE OR JULY OF THIS PAST YEAR ET IMPLEMENT ETV IMPLEMENTED A FRONT END APPLICATION CALLED ID ME TO BASICALLY- HAVE BETTER TAX AT THE FRONT END AND VERIFICATION SO THE- PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM A FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT WAS. CREATED TO HELP- NONTRADITIONAL- WORKERS FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. OF ALLOWED FOR. SOME THE PROJECT BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A THING KIND OF ERROR. OR SO INPUT IDEA WITH- THE SECOND THEY HAVE DOING WORK CHECK SO THAT THE U. S. THAT COME IN. CAN BE CROSS CHECKED AGAINST OTHER LIST. OF INELIGIBLE- INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS PRISONERS AND MADE SOME. OF THAT LEARNING FROM SOME OF THE- THE FRAUD THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST. AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE D. A.'S. TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE SOME OF THESE ROSTER SO THAT'S ON THE BACK END ON THE FRONT AND I THINK THEY'VE BEEN DOING MORE BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO CATCH IT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. SO THAT'S- AT. I THINK I HIT YOUR ATV QUESTION BUT LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FOR THE ONES ON THAT ONE. I THINK THERE IS THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK LOAD. AND THAT- WE WANT TO PROCESS THOSE YOU AYE CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT WITH. THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN REGARDS TO FRAUD. I'M IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM. STRATEGY FOR HOMELESSNESS I WOULD SAY THAT. IT'S A MULTI LAYERED WE- PROPOSE CAL. WHICH IS REALLY LOOKING AT. THE SERVICE SIDE OF- A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO- ARE HOMELESS HAVE. OTHER ISSUES AND IT'S TRYING TO COUPLE LOOK AT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE TO REALLY GET AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS- BUT WE DO HAVE THE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION IN HOMELESSNESS AS WELL- AND THAT IS FOR THE MORE TRADITIONAL. OF HOME KEY EFFORTS WHICH HAPPENED AT H. T. T. AND IF THEY DID. OUR SYSTEM A PROGRAM IN SEVERAL MONTHS AND WERE ABLE TO- CONNECT WITH LOCALS AND HAVE OVER SIX THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR HOMELESS OR THOSE WHO ARE ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS. NOW THE H. C. S. SIDE OF IT IS ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT REALLY IS LOOKING TO ACQUIRE- UNITS THAT ARE ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF CARE SO UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF HOMELESS- INDIVIDUALS NEED. SOMETHING MORE INTENSE THAN JUST A ROOM AND- SHELTER OVER THEIR HEADS THAT PROVIDED THAT THE SERVICES PROVIDED WITH CAL AIM ALONG WITH- A FIFTH PLACE TO STAY. IS REALLY TRYING TO GET AT THAT LONG TERM SOLUTION VERSUS JUST A SHELTER WHERE YOU HAVE- INDIVIDUAL FLIPPING FOR THE EVENING- AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN REGARDS TO THE LONG TERM- INVESTMENT. IN THOUGH IT IS ONE TIME IT IS ONE TIME TO ACQUIRE HOTELS MOTELS- A REHAB. SENIOR US. SENIOR LIVING SUCH AS R. C. AFTER- AIR AIR OFF ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES- SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR INCREASING OUR OUR HOUSING SUPPLY- FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF CARE SO- YES I AGREE THAT IN THE PAST- THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SHORT TERM- FIXES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO AT THE STATE LEVEL IS TO INTEGRATE. THE SERVICES WITH- WITH WITH SHELTER SO THAT THIS COULD BE MORE OF A LONG TERM. SOLUTION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSES ALTHOUGH I. I DO HAVE TO SHARE A SENTIMENT THAT A LOT OF OUR THAT A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES SHARE. IN THAT- THE RESPONSE BY EDT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY INADEQUATE- TO. REALLY COMPREHEND HOW CHALLENGING THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN TO WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE- IN ADDITION TO JUST. THE FEAR THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT LOSING THEIR HOME LOSING WHERE THEIR THEIR SAFETY NET AND THEIR TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. AT THE ADDITION OF A RESPONSE TO A HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE ALL BATTLE WITH AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY PIECE OF WHAT THE STATE DOES NOT WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO. AND HOW IS THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT THE MONEY THAT WE PUT ASIDE FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS IT'S ACTUALLY USED TO WISELY SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN THIS HEARING. AT LEAST IN SUB FOR WHEN WE HAVE OUR UPCOMING EDT HEARING AN ARC OUR UP COMING HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING- HEARING THAT WE THIS BODY IS PREPARED TO INSURE THAT WE HOLD THE DEPARTMENTS NECESSARY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE PROVIDING SOLUTIONS SO THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN DIGNITY PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES PEOPLE CAN TRUST OUR GOVERNMENT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY BE ABLE TO TRUST AND EIGHTY DEPARTMENT THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL. IN ENSURING THAT PEOPLE JUST. HELLO THEIR LIVES AND I'M LOOKING FOR TO THAT TASK THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR OUR VICE CHAIR AND INTO A DOCTORATE. I THINK IT WAS A CARE I JUST WANT TO KIND OF DELVE INTO THAT YOUR WINDOWS ME INTO SOME MORE SPECIFICS OF THE BUDGET- SO FIRST OF THE L. A. O- YOU CAN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ANY QUESTIONS YET SO I FIGURED I'D START- IS CERTAINLY IN READING YOUR REVIEW YOUR ANALYSIS IN THE OUTLOOK YEAH CLEARLY OUR BUDGET HEALTH LONG TERM IS TIED TO OUR ECONOMIC HEALTH. AND IN TERMS OF SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF ARE THERE ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT- THE ONLY A WOULD SUGGEST OR RECOMMEND TO REVITALIZE THE CALIFORNIA KANEMI. I WOULD MENTION POSSIBLY MAY BE STATE CONFORMITY TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID IN REGARDS TO ALLOWING PPP EXPENDITURES TO BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE- AND MAYBE APPLE LIVING DAILY ON MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT PLANETS CAN. CAN CAN CHIME IN AND WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION. IS OPEN TO THAT IDEA. YES MR VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE ARE. WE DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF- WHETHER SOME OF THE PROPOSALS COULD BE MADE MORE IMPACTFUL- THEN THEY ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSED IN TERMS OF- PROVIDING SIMPLY- YOU KNOW CENTURY- MORE DIRECT GRANTED AWAY TO SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES THAT ARE- ON THE MARGIN I DON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE OFFICE IS AVAILABLE TO. JOIN IN ALL- YES RAINBOW. YEAH CAN YOU CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME. YES YES GREAT. YEAH I MEAN LET ME SPEAK I GUESS DIRECTLY TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. THE POTENTIAL MERITS OF. MAKING THE WE'LL START. MAKING THE PDP FONG THE DOCTOR BALL- ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR REVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS. I'M SORRY. I WAS- THAT THE FUNDS TO GO SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD BE TARGETED TO THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- ONE OF THE MAIN CRITIQUES ESPECIALLY OF THE FIRST ROUND OF PDP WAS THAT IT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY WELL TARGETED TO BUSINESSES THAT WERE MOST IMPACTED- AND SO THERE THERE COULD BE YOU KNOW RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IF WE WERE TO MAKE THOSE EXPENSES DEDUCTIBLE- AT THE STATE LEVEL WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT WOULD REALLY BE A- A MOVE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDING. THE MOST TARGETED ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. WITH THE LIMITED FOLLOW UP WITH THAT- BEFORE THE BAR OF FINANCE AT TIMES IN A THEIR PERSPECTIVE BUT- THOSE TWO AS AS MUCH ABOUT WHEN MY COLLEAGUES. ON A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES REGARDLESS OF INDUSTRIES BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BUT BROADLY- ARE SUFFERING DURING THIS DAY THIS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY WITH A PANDEMIC IN DUE PROCESSION THAT HAS IMPACTED ALL INDUSTRIES. AND SO TO SAY THAT A HOSPITAL FOR EXAMPLE WHO GOT A PPP LOAN TO STAY AFLOAT. NOW IS NOW EXPECTED TO PAY TAXES STATE STATE TAXES ON THAT OR A RESTAURANT OR A- A BARBER OR A HOTEL- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE IF THE- DISCUSSION IS TO MAKE. SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF AND NONPROFIT ASSISTANCE RELEASED MORE ROBUST. OF A WOULD YOU WOULD THINK THAT WE WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE. MORE ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ASKING. SMALL BUSINESSES WHO GOT RELIEF BECAUSE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE NOW HAVING. TO PAY TAXES ON THAT RELIEF. YES SORRY I MEAN I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS- YOU KNOW I THINK IT IT COULD BE A POLICY THAT'S WORTH- THE LEGISLATURE DELIBERATION HOWEVER- ANY. FUNDING THAT WE'RE PUTTING. FOR ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- THERE'S GOING TO BE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE CAN PROVIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT'S GONNA. REQUIRE NOT TRADE UP TRADE OFF NOT ONLY WITHIN- SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF THE VARIOUS PRIORITIES THE FUNDING GO TO BUT ALSO JUST MORE BROADLY TO ALL OF THE THINGS THE STATE. COULD BE DOING TO TRY TO- COMBAT THE PANDEMIC AND HELP THE ECONOMY RECOVER- SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE PPP EXPENSES AGAINST. ALL THE OTHER POTENTIAL PRIORITIES THE MY ONE ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES A SYNDROME AS WELL AS- THINGS THE STATE COULD BE DOING MORE BROADLY TO HELP THE ECONOMY. RECOVER AND TO GET THE PANDEMIC UNDER CONTROL. ARE THERE ARE THERE. ALTERNATIVES RECOMMENDATIONS. BESIDES THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET HE WOULD RECOMMEND. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR YOU AT THIS TIME BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEEN- DELIBERATING ON AND SOMETHING WE PLAN TO OFFER THE LEGISLATURE SUGGESTIONS ON THAT WHEN WITH THE PROCESS. OKAY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON- STATE CONFORMITY. REGARDED AS THE TECH FIVE BILLION PPP. SURE. THAT PACKAGE WAS PASSED LATE DECEMBER SO WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY DIVE INTO THAT BUT- IN REGARDS TO ANY P. P. P. OF CONFORMITY. PPP CONFORMITY AT THE STATE LEVEL WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IMPACTS TO OUT- TO THE REGION IN TERMS OF REVENUES. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME SURPLUS THAT WE'RE FORECASTING AND BEING- VERY PRUDENT IN TRYING TO SPEND THAT I ONE TIME. DOLLARS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT- SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED IT'S NOT PART OBVIOUSLY OF OUR BUDGET BECAUSE OF THAT THE TIMING TIMING OF THIS- BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO CONSIDER THE- POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THE BOTTOM LINE. I THANK YOU. ARE MOVING ON EDUCATION- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHAT CAN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EXPECT FROM THE STATE AT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN AS OUTLINED. IN THE COST OF. THAT INCREASE I THINK THAT- FREQUENCY. THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF DETAILS IN REGARDS TO THIS ENTIRE PROPOSAL- WITH. DISTRICT NOW WANTING TO REOPEN AND I KNOW THE CHAIR IS BEEN VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS. WHAT IS THE STATE'S FULL COMMITMENT TO HELPING SCHOOLS REOPEN. WELL THE STATE COVER FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE TESTS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTING- ANDDOES THE STATE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS THESE TESTS. SURE AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO MY COLLEAGUE- JESSICA HOLMES COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT. COMMUNICATION AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE BEEN. ATTEMPTING TO BE AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN REGARDS TO LISTENING TO THEIR NEEDS AND- DISCUSSING OUR OWN THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF. ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS- IN REGARDS TO THE DAY TWO BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS THERE'S A FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE. ALL SORT OF OUT THERE TO ASSIST SCHOOLS AND- DEALING WITH THE IMPACT OF. THE DOCUMENT EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN- BUT TESTING IS ONE OF THE- ELIGIBLE- EFFORTS UNDER THE TWO BILLION AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW TESTING IS GOING TO BE ONE WAY THAT WE- ARE AT THAT BOOK STILL COMFORTABLE RETURNING BACK TO IN SCHOOL INSTRUCTION. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO LOOK INTO- PROPORTION OF THE STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE- ELIGIBLE FOR. MEDICARE AND SO THAT THERE COULD BE SOME FEDERAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN HELPING WITH THE TESTING COUGH AS WELL. OKAY I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT'S IT YOU KNOW I THINK HE SAID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I BASIC THE CONCERN I THINK FROM JUST THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS AMONGST OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO QUESTIONED THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE WHAT NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED TO REOPEN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW. THAT OUR ECONOMY OUR HEALTH CARE CAPACITY. AND JUST- OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE ISN'T GOING TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY IF WE DON'T REOPEN THE SCHOOLS SAFELY- IN TERMS OF DEFERRALS AND I THINK MAYBE DEPARTMENT FINANCE CAN. ANSWER THIS FIRST AND THEN I'LL GET THE PERSPECTIVE OF ELIO. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT FULLY ADDRESSING THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF THE DEFERRALS COMPLETELY- I KNOW THAT THAT THAT. THE L. A. O. AS OUTLINED CONCERNS WITH OPERATING DEFICITS MOVING. BY MOVING FORWARD AND OTHER BUDGET YEARS THAT WILL GET LARGER. AND WE HAVE. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING PAYING DOWN TWO THIRDS OF THE DEFERRALS. BUT THEN PROPOSING ONGOING- COSTS OF LIVING INCREASES WILL- THAT WOULD EXACERBATE THE ONGOING- DEFICITS IN THE FUTURE. WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OR MAYBE WHAT'S THE IT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE THINKING OR THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF. WHY NOT PAY OFF ALL THE REFERRALS WE DID LAST YEAR. WITH GOALS. SURE AND YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I THINK THE EASY ANSWER THE SIMPLE ANSWER TO THAT IS TO- PAY OFF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THOUGH THAT- IN REGARDS TO ALL OF. THE SUPPORTING SCHOOL- ON THOSE DEFERRALS WITH IT FOR THE POTENTIALLY A CASH FLOW ISSUE BUT ALSO LEAVING ROOM FOR OTHER THINGS- THE NEED TO GET DONE AND SO. IN TERMS OF- PRIORITIES. THAT MADE ROOM FOR OTHER PEOPLE- BUT SAID I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IS THE START OF THE CONVERSATION AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO. THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD AND- TO CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES. YES MISTER ROGERS THANK YOU I THINK OUR OFFICE. WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS WOULD VIEW THE BUDGET REALLY AS- TO BUDGETS IN ONE BECAUSE THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BUDGET IS SEPARATE NO WAY AND SO. ACTUALLY THE OPERATING DEFICITS WERE PROJECTING IN THE FUTURE UNDER THE NINE NINETY EIGHT SAID AT THE BUDGET ARE NOT PRESENT ON THE PROPERTY EIGHT SIDE. THAT BEING SAID I THINK OUR OFFICE WOULD VIEW THAT- IT WOULD BE WORTH YOUR CONSIDERATION TO ADD MORE TO PAYING DOWN THE DEFERRALS BECAUSE- WE DO HAVE MORE RESOURCES THIS YEAR THAN WE MAY AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS ITSELF MIGHT BE THE RIGHT TIME TO PAY DOWN THAT- WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A ONE TIME DEBT. SURE AND I AND I SO APPRECIATE THAT OKAY FOR CATION. IN THE DEFERRALS I THINK I ADMIT AND CORRECT IF I'M WRONG IF YOU IF YOU- IT IS ACCURATE THAT YOU'VE ASKED THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAST YEAR. TO CONTINUE TO SPEND. BY WITH WITH NOT KNOWING WHEN THE MONEY GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE REFERRALS. SO IT WOULD. AT LEAST IN MY OPINION TO BE PRUDENT. FOR US TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO TAKE CARE THE DEFERRALS- MEDIALLY COMPLETELY. THANK AFTER I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD THINK OF IT AS- WE SHIFTED THE CASH MANAGEMENT BURDEN TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM THE STATE WITH THE DEFERRALS. AND SO. I MEAN IN GENERAL THE IDEA OF PAYING THEM DOWN AS SOON AS YOU IS IT POSSIBLE IT IS A GOOD IDEA. BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE BORROWING. THE TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT PAYMENT DIRECTLY. TO CASH FLOW NOTES IN THE MUNICIPAL MARKET. I IN TERMS OF- ENTERS A HOSPITAL CAPACITY AND STAFFING I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP YET TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE THERE PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET- TO. INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF NURSES I KNOW THAT WITH THE HOSPITALS ARE DEALING WITH. AND YOU. KNOW TRYING TO FIND A WAY AROUND THESE THAT. TRYING TO DEAL WITH THESE NO RATIO AND- OF COURSE WE HAVE TO PAY THE TELL. UP DOWN THE STATE NOW- ARE THERE SPECIFIC BUDGETARY ITEMS. THAT WOULD. DEAL WITH HOSPITAL STAFFING- ESPECIALLY SPECIFICALLY WHEN NURSES. SURE I WOULD POINT OUT ON PAGE FORTY SIX- ARE COVERED NINETEEN DIRECT RESPONSE COST ESTIMATES WHICH DOES INCLUDE- COSTS THROUGH THE SALUKIS AND OPERATING- COSTS- BUT I WOULD ALSO- HANDED OVER TO ONE OF MY EIGHTY JUST CALLING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE. THAT WOULD BE- THE TICKET OUT TO. HI RYAN MILLER AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MMHM. YEAH IT IN ADDITION TO WILL. BUT HONESTLY IT'S JUST TO MENTION AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE RESPONSES GENERALLY BEEN THROUGH ACTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN TAKING- THE SURGE ACTIVITY IS- YOU KNOW THE HOSPITAL DECOMPRESSION EFFORTS- AND I THINK IT WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS ON A PERCENT RATE INCREASE WE PROVIDED IN THE SPRING TO- SKILLED NURSING NURSING FACILITIES- AND- YOU KNOW- STATE PLAN AMENDMENT THROUGH- THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT- WE X. WITH THE SOON WILL BE IN EFFECT THROUGH THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR CONSISTENT WITH OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT- WHEN THE FEDERAL. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL AND- I THINK I GOT A BOTTLE HALF OF WHAT YOU SAID BUT- BUT IN TERMS OF I THINK A YOU MENTIONED SKINNER SOME FACILITIES AND HAVING STILL HASN'T DISABILITIES AND HOSPITALS. ALL HAVE PRESSURE. DID FOR STAFFING- AND I GUESS- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IS THERE A LONG TERM PLAN OUTLINED BY THE GOVERNOR TO MAYBE. EXPANDERS IN PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITIES OF THE CS USING THESE KEYS OR OTHER AVENUES- MAYBE SOME LICENSE RECIPROCITY TO ALLOW- INDIVIDUALS ANDERSON WHO ARE MOVING INTO CALIFORNIA TO ALLOW- THOSE. ARE LICENSES TO APPLY HERE AND THEN THEY CAN THEY CAN WORK IN OUR HOSPITALS. AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. MR FONG I'LL SAY THAT- UNDER ONE OF OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WE ARE EXPANDING ON HEALTH CARE- CAPACITY AND I CAN GET YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AT THREE FIFTEEN PROGRAM AND REPLACING IT UP. I JUST HAVE THE- TWO OR THREE MORE QUESTIONS IT WILL SIMPLY- I THINK THE MEMBERS HERE KNOW ABOUT MY- INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL HOW MUCH IS IN IN THIS BUDGET FOR A- HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. I'M GONNA HANNAH QUESTION TO STEVE WEALTH. HELLO STEVE WELLS BERMAN FINANCE IN HEARING YES YEAH. ALSO THE- SO THE BUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CURRENTLY THE BUDGET AS PROPOSED- INCLUDES THEIR OPERATIONAL COSTS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THEIR- AND THEN THERE'S THIS THERE'S AN AMOUNT FOR CAPITAL COSTS. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT REPRESENTS. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF FOUR ON IT FOR NEXT YEAR OF AYE CAPTAIN TRADE FUNDS. THERE'S NO FUNDING CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR FOR PROP- AS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL START WORKING ON THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT THEY EXPECT TO HAVE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY. OKAY BUT DO YOU ASK THE MADE THAT WHAT WAS THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ON HIGH SPEED RAIL- IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MONEY WAS ALLOCATED THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE IN THE LOWER RIGHT. CORRECT THE GIVEN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET YES. YEAH THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET IT IS ABOUT- TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN A PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT AND CAP AND TRADE MONEY AND DO YOU AS THE PUMP ON. AND YOU AS THE CAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU EXPECT THE GOVERNOR TO CUT HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDING. WELL THE FUNDING FOR PROPER. PHOTO SENDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BE VERY DEPENDED UPON WELL WHATEVER THE FINAL AGREED UPON BUSINESS PLAN IS THIS RELEASED IN FEBRUARY. AND I THINK THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. YOU DON'T WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE RELEASE OF PLAN. OKAY WELL I GUESS I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN WHETHER YOU'VE GOT HAS DEVELOPMENT IN THE NEXT TIME YOU TESTIFIED ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE I IN TERMS OF WILDFIRES- HOW ARE YOU AS THE DIPLOMA FINANCE HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO ACCELERATE FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS THAT THAT I THINK THAT. THE GOAL AMONG THE NUMBER MY COLLEAGUES HE SAID SOME LIGHT ON SOME SPECIFICS. THANKS TO. MY COLLEAGUE AT FINANCED. I'LL SEND YOU A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO- FIRSTLY WOULD SEE THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTING I'M SORRY THAT GOVERNMENT BUDGET REFLECTS AN INVESTMENT OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION IN FOREST RESILIENCE- AND THAT IS REALLY DESIGNED AS A BROAD BASED PACKAGE THAT IS A PART OF THAT PACKAGE THERE'S A THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT WILL BE A PART OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND THE GOAL OF. SPENDING IS TO GET PROJECTS A CRITICAL FIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ANOTHER WITH THE GOAL OF TRYING TO PREPARE THE STATE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON. OKAY SO THERE'S BEEN COMPLAINING I THINK IN THAT AND THAT AND. THAT AND IT REALLY I CAN'T BUDGET PACKAGE THAT WILL SEE. THE NUMBER OF THE THERE'S A NUMBER WAYS THAT THE PACKAGE ADDRESS IT ON SOME OF THE DIFFERENT PERMITTING PROCESS SEASON REVIEWS. OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET THERE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT CALLED THE CAL THE GPD I'M THAT STREAMLINES THE SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS FOR AND- OVER TWENTY MILLION ACRES MISSY RESPONSIBILITY AREA SO THAT WILL BE A PART OF IT. I'M IN AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KIND OF PREFER MEDINA STATIONS USE ANOTHER FOCUS IT AS- AS WELL AS SOME CONTRACTING EXEMPTION. AND TO ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO GET ON THE GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS THAT'S OUR SHARED GOAL. PROGRAM WILL LOOK FOR TO SEE ALL THOSE DETAILS I'D I WOULD BUY. ONE LAST QUESTION I OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO- AND YOU I DON'T KNOW THEY GAVE EDT. YOU THERE'S NO DOUBT I THINK I GOING ALL OF US HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THEN OF COURSE ALL OF US TO SERVE IN THIS LEGISLATURE THE EDT IS FAILING THAT COULD BE ANSWERS BEING PROVIDED TODAY ARE VERY BROAD BASED THERE NEEDS TO BE A DETAILED PROPOSAL. AND PLANS OF HOW TO OVERHAUL EDIE- IS UNACCEPTABLE THIS AND I'LL SAY THAT YOU JUST NEED MORE MONEY WHEN MONEY IS NOT THE ISSUE AND WE'VE LIVED IT I TALKED TO CHAIRMAN THING ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE LIVED THROUGH THIS WITH THE DMV. AND THE DMV WELL WE GAVE THEM HAD ADDED RESOURCES IS NOT OPERATING FUNCTIONALLY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT IT'S NOT A MONEY ISSUE IT'S A LEADERSHIP ISSUE. AND THAT WE NEEDED WHEN WE ASKED. FOR VERY DETAILED PROPOSAL ON THAT IN TERMS OF- MY LAST QUESTION AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE ADULTING ME. MAYBE THE L. A. OKAY AND- HE TO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME NEW MEMBERS AND- WE HEAR THE- THE IDEA OF BEGAN LIMIT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN. WHAT WE WERE GONNA EXPECT OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS- IF WE DOWN TO GET UNDER THE GALA MEADOW WE SOMEHOW EXCEEDED- AND WHAT. WILL HAPPEN- IF WE DO. YES MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU- RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION- IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INDICATED THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE LIMIT- BY- THIS COMING YEAR AND THE RULES ARE THAT HALF OF THE AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE WOULD GO BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS AND HALF WOULD. GO TO SCHOOLS BUT REALLY I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION FOR THE MAY REVISION BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS WILL LIKELY SHIFT AND- SO I THINK YOU KNOW I ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH IT WAS- YOU KNOW NOTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S- UP PRESS BRIEFING IN IN IN THE DOCUMENT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA KNOW MORE IN THE COMING MONTHS ABOUT IT SO- YEAH. I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THE MISTER. THANK YOU MUCH BYE SURE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND THEN MISTER MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WANTED TO WELCOME THE VICE CHAIR AS WELL. ALSO WANTED TO EXTEND AN APPRECIATION AND INDULGENCE FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS. WELL FOR MANY OF US THIS IS OUR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL I AT LEAST CAME UP ON FRIDAY WHICH WAS BUDGET DAY OUT OF EXCITEMENT AND STILL A WILLINGNESS. TO GRAB AN OLD SCHOOL COPY OF THE BUDGET AND READ IT COVER TO COVER AND SO. WHILE I WILL CONTAIN MY QUESTIONS TODAY SOLELY TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY OFFICE ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SO FIRST IF I CAN TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS TO HELP MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. AND A SYSTEM THAT BETTER USES HEALTH DATA TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. SOME OF THESE INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. THE OFFICE OF MEDICARE INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION THE CENTER CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION. AND THE RECASTING OF AWESOME HEAD UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE NEW OFFICES AND PROGRAMS. HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I FEEL OBLIGED TO REMIND IS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. BEST COLLABORATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT MORE DETAILS ON THESE PROPOSALS. HI I'M HANNAH QUESTION OVER TO ONE OF MY AGE OF COLLEAGUES FOR THE FOR MORE DETAILS. HI RANKBRAIN MILLER AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I TRIED KEEPING MY VIDEO OFF OF IT. APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- WELL- WE ACTUALLY RELEASED- LANGUAGE JOHN ON THE OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL JUST BEFORE. AND THEN IT STARTED LAST YEAR IN AND WHILE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW SOME CHANGES THIS TIME AROUND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE COVERED THAT ISSUE I THINK PRETTY. PRETTY THOROUGHLY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND CLEARLY- YOU KNOW SITUATIONS CHANGED QUITE A BIT- SO WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO YOU KNOW HEARING- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT FEEDBACK WE GET. FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND OF COURSE FROM MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE- BUT I THINK IN TO IN TERMS OF THE TIMING- WE WOULD BE PLANNING TO RELEASE THE DETAILS OF THE OF THE- OFFICE OF AFFORDABILITY PROPOSAL- ON THE FEBRUARY FIRST TO STATUTORY DEADLINE. FRAME- THAT THAT WE HAVE FOR TRAILER BILLING. I WOULD ENCOURAGE AS STRONGLY AS I COULD- HE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND WHILE MANY OF THEM WERE REFERENCED IN BEING RELEASED IN THE SPRING I WOULD WANT THESE RELEASED MUCH EARLIER SO WE CAN AGENDA IS THEM DISCUSS THEM AND- FRANKLY TO VETS MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. WHICH ARE NEEDED AND NEED TO BE DISCUSSED. THIS PANDEMIC THOUGH HAS TRULY BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT THE DISPARITY GAPS THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS. HOW CAN WE ENSURE AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDING FOR ONE TIME PROGRAM PROPOSALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE AND I WILL GIVE YOU SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU REFERENCE REGARDING THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE FULL CONTINUUM OF. MENTAL HEALTH CARE HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN TO EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THESE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT PRESERVES AND EXPANDS HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR OUR CHILDREN AND MITIGATES HOMELESSNESS BOTH IN OUR RURAL AND MUNICIPAL AREAS OF OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK EQUITY IS ALSO ANOTHER THREAD- THAT GOES THROUGHOUT MANY OF OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS IN THIS. YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND- IT'S AND IT'S AS IMPORTANT TO- THE MINISTRATION TO GET THAT RIGHT AS WELL AND SO I WOULD SAY- WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU ON THAT TO GET IDEAS- IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS GREATER EQUITY. IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE DOLLARS ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT NOT ALL ARE KERN COUNTIES ARE THE SAME AND MANY OF OUR COUNTY STRUGGLE WITH THE RESOURCES FOR MATCHING FUNDS AND- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR. ALL OF OUR COUNTIES. NOW SOME ARE. L. A. APPROPRIATELY DISCUSSED IN A APOLOGIES FOR NOT ASKING QUESTIONS BUT I THINK YOUR HAND OUT WAS THREE PAGES IN THE BUDGET WAS A COUPLE HUNDRED PAGES AND SO. BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE YOUR CASELOAD PROJECTIONS WERE MUCH CLOSER TO REALITY AS IT PANNED OUT. DURING THIS LAST YEAR. AND SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT IF I CAN. ABOUT SOME OF THE SAFETY NET CASELOAD INCREASES WE PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED. AND YET OUR FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS NEED ASSISTANCE IN THE AREAS OF HOUSING. FOOD SECURITY HEALTH CARE AND MORE. WHAT CAN WE DO. TO BE ABLE TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. INCLUDING CAL WORKS AND MEDICAL. HOW CAN WE BEST WORK WITH OUR IMMIGRANT SERVICE PROGRAMS NETWORKS OF CBO'S TO REACH OUT TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. WHO HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT OF THE CHILLING EFFECT A PUBLIC CHARGE. THE QUESTION IS FOR FINANCE I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET TO WE HAVE CASELOAD PROJECTIONS. THE PRODUCTION IN THE BUDGET IS FIFTEEN POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE ENROLLED INTO MEDIC CAL. WHERE THESE PROJECTIONS BORN OUT AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT- WE AS A STATE ARE REACHING OUT TO OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES TO BE INCLUSIVE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN- I AM GOING TO HAND THAT OVER TO ONE OF MY EIGHTY JUST COLLEAGUES FOR SOME MORE IMPORTANTLY WHICH. HI THIS IS- ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YES- CERTAINLY I THINK WE ARE SEEING SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASES PARTICULARLY WITH THE CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ON THE MEDICAID SIDE. AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- ARE ARE THE COUNTY PARTNERS ARE ARE CONTINUING TO TAKE CASES IN. AND IT REALLY DOES KIND OF DEPEND ON THE ON THE INDIVIDUAL SORT OF RULES RUN THE PROGRAM IN THE PAST WE HAVE- PROVIDED FUNDING IS THE STATE TO NONPROFITS TO- TO. MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE CONNECTING TO IT TO SERVICES AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SO- CERTAINLY WANT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ALL AND CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND- YOU KNOW HOW WE MIGHT- YOU KNOW CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE. HOW TO RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES I WILL LIMIT MYSELF TO TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND JUST. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR INDULGENCE. COVERED NINETEEN AS HIGHLIGHTED MANY OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO COMPOUNDED OUR POPULATION HEALTH CHALLENGES. HOW DOES THE BUDGET HELP TO BUILD A MORE ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO BE MORE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. WHILE ALSO HELPING US TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF EXISTING AND ONGOING HEALTH. EPIDEMICS SUCH AS THE OPIOID CRISIS HABSI AND STDS JUST TO NAME A FEW. I CAN EFFORT ADAM DORSEY OR RYAN MILLER COULD ADD TO THAT. HI RYAN MILLER AGAIN FROM FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT. ASSEMBLY THE RESOURCES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL I'M NOT REALLY ARE FOCUSED AT THE MOMENT ON- YOU KNOW THE SURGERY FOR ITS WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER- IN INCREASING TESTING- AND CERTAINLY ALSO- YOU KNOW- BUT YOU KNOW THE ESTIMATED FUNDING THAT E HAVE SET ASIDE FOR THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION EFFORTS- I WOULD HIGHLIGHT A PROPOSAL THAT IS THROUGH THE HHS AGENCY. TO DO A LOOK BACK ANNA ANNA RETROACTIVE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN- PANDEMIC OF THROUGH AN EQUITY LINES. AND AS I THINK THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY FOR THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAD GOING INTO THIS- YEAH I THINK THAT- CLEARLY- BOTH OF THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL- YEAH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE LOCALHOST JURISDICTIONS- TO SAY THEIR STRAINED I THINK WOULD BE YOU KNOW QUITE AN UNDERSTATEMENT I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO HOW TO QUITE. BUT IT- BUT I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND THAT PROPOSAL- AND SO YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHERS TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. I FEEL OBLIGATED TO REMIND US THAT WE HAVEN'T TURNED OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND THE FOLDER DEPARTMENT PEOPLE STILL HAVE HEART ATTACKS THEY STILL HAVE STROKES PEOPLE STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH OPIOIDS AND STDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES IF I CAN BECAUSE STRESS ANXIETY EXTREME EXHAUSTION AND BURNOUT ARE THE MOST COMMON CONDITIONS REPORTED BY OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. WHAT MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE WELL BEING OF THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND IN ADDITION AS A BY PRODUCT OF OUR CURRENT REALITY MORE AND MORE STUDENTS HAVE A NEW FOUND INTEREST IN PUBLIC HEALTH HOW IS THE STATE ENSURING WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FOR THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WOULD AGAIN POINT TO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION- IN. FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR STUDENTS THAT I I'VE I BROUGHT UP EARLIER- AND YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD POINTS I THINK THAT- B. THERE ARE THERE IS A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- ALLOCATION. FOR HIGHER ED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- PROPOSALS RIGHT NOW- IN REGARDS TO LINKAGES TO WHAT STUDENTS ARE LEARNING IN SCHOOL AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEEDED IN THE WORKFORCE. AND I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO VISIT- HEALTHCARE SHOPPING FOR THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN- THE DEARTH THAT MEANS THAT THAT THAT. THE-NEED FOR MORE OF THEM- IN REGARDS TO- INVESTMENTS. NOW THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS I WOULD HAVE TO TURN TO ONE OF MY- COLLEAGUES AT FINANCE. ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- I THINK THIS IS- AN AREA WHERE THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE- AND I THINK AS WE GET OUTSIDE OF THIS PANDEMIC WILL WILL HAVE TO LOOK. TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND KIND OF SEE- YOU KNOW WHERE THIS LEAVES US AND WE AND KIND OF WHAT KIND OF PLANS WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE BUT- YOU KNOW IT THAT AT THE TIME AND COST PAID YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF WORKFORCE PROGRAMS MINISTRATIONS MADE A PERMANENT. OR ERIN ONGOING GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS THERE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK FIRST PROGRAMS- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WORK IN THIS AREA THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND- AGAIN WE LOOK REALLY FORWARD YOU KNOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES- OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE MUCH OF THE HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND YET THERE ARE STILL REGIONS OF OUR STATE THAT STRUGGLE. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PROVIDERS TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC. AND IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT OUR FRONTLINE PROVIDERS ARE. IN NEED OF RESILIENCY I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON US AS A STATES TO DO ALL WE CAN TO. HELP BUILD THAT PIPELINE AND- ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO. START THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN HELP WITH THE NEXT PANDEMIC. HAVING GONE THROUGH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. WHERE I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF DRAMA. I KNOW THAT. THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES NEED SUPPORT. AND I WILL WANT TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE AND FIGUREOUT HOW WE PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THEM. SO THAT THEY WILL HAVE RESILIENCY THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THE NEXT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SOME OF MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY IN A IN THE AREA OF A PUBLIC SAFETY- AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST GO THROUGH LIKE THE FOUR AREAS THAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. AND IN. OFFICE FINANCE DECIDED THEY WANTED TO DELVE RIGHT INTO IT OR EVEN TO GET BACK TO ME. WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN SOME FIVE. WHICH I USED TO BE TERRIBLE. AND WHEN I WAS THE CHAIR PASS BUDGETS OF FIVE- SO THE AREAS ARE COURTS. PROBATE CDCR- OUR POPULATION AND CAMERAS. SO THAT'S COURTS PROBATE CDCR POPULATION AND CAMPUS. ON THE COURTS OF THE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN TRIGGER CUTS TO DID YOU DO THIS- BRANCH HOW MUCH HAS BEEN RESTORED TO THE COURTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF WHAT REMAINING RESOURCE CHALLENGES REMAINS FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS AND UNDERSTAND I'M SAYING THIS IN THE CONTEXT WHEN I WAS ELECTED TWENTY TWELVE IS LIKE A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR. DEFICIT MONEY IS EVER TAKEN OUT OF THE COURT BUDGET I WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD TO RESTORE THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION I WOULD HATE TO SEE THAT WE'RE REGRESSING. BACK AND CONTINUE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF COURT IN ADDITION TO THAT COURT QUESTION. ADMINISTRATION ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL ONGOING RESOURCES FOR SELF HELP CENTERS IN THE COURTS. CAN YOU DESCRIBE IN WHAT WAYS THE SELF HELP CENTERS OPERATE VIRTUALLY ARE HAVE VIRTUAL COMPONENTS THAT CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR LITIGANTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. SECOND COBIT. WITH FEWER THAN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS IN STATE PRISON. NOT THAT ONE HOW MUCH AT CDC ARE. ENCOURAGING COSTS FOR NINETY RELATE X. INCLUDING PEOPLE TESTS AND HOPEFUL AS WE MOVE FOR THAT. IMAGE BOB IS THE MINISTER CONSIDER. AT THIS RELIEF. OF BY VULNERABLE P. IN THE STATE'S PRISONS THAT ARE SET FOR RELEASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE MY CONCERN IS THAT WE JUST DON'T JUST LET PEOPLE OUT THERE WE HAVE A PLAN FOR WHEN THEY GET OUT SO THEY DON'T. RECIDIVISTS OR CAUSE MORE HARM TO THE COMMUNITIES- YES I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR THEIR MEDICAL WELL BEING BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DO RELEASE THEM THAT THEY DON'T CREATE PROBLEMS DOWN IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT AS COVERT CDCR COPULATION WITH FEWER THAN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS IN STATE PRISON. WHEN IT WAS OVER CLOSE TO A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND HOW MUCH IS CDC ARE SAVED. AS A RESULT OF THESE POPULATION REDUCTIONS. WHERE THE SAVINGS RE DIRECTED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE OPERATION BEING CDC OUR OPERATIONS IF SO WHAT AREAS. IN ADDITION. IS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL PRISON CLOSURES BASED ON THE L. A. L.'S POPULATION PROJECTIONS THAT INDICATE FIVE PRISONS CAN BE SAFELY CLOSE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SAVING THE STATE TAXPAYERS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY M. BILLIONS AND AVOID IT CAPITAL MAINTENANCE INVESTMENTS NOT ONLY DOES SAVINGS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE SAME QUESTION ISN'T RELEASING PEOPLE WOULD CLOVER PROBLEM DO WE HAVE A WRAPAROUND SERVICE PLAN ON THE OUTSIDE. SHE WOULD DIVERT AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DON'T RECIDIVISTS SHOULD WE PUT IN ALL THE SERVICES MAYBE EVEN TO COMMUNITY GROUPS SO THAT TYPE OF GOING TO A COMMUNITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN FORMALLY INCARCERATED WHO CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS AGAIN DON'T BECOME A PROBLEM WHEN THEY GET OUT. AND THEN FINALLY. CAMERAS THERE'S A TOTAL OF THIRTY MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS FOR CAMERAS BOTH STATIONARY. AND BODY CAMERAS R. J. DONOVAN DUE TO THE LAWSUIT WHICH INCIDENTLY. THE STATE ADMINISTRATION CDC R. B. P. H. IS APPEALING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD NOT BE PUTTING BODY CAMERAS ON EVERYONE. IN CDC ARE SPECIALLY TO PRISON GUARD IT PROTECTS THEM FROM FRIVOLOUS COMPLAINTS BY INMATES BUT ALSO LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PRISON GUARDS AND INMATES IT WORKS BOTH WAYS BOTH ENTITIES CAN DO THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY SAY WE'RE APPEALING. BEING ABLE TO PUT BODY CAMERAS ON EVERYONE IN CDC ARE I DON'T KNOW ONE WHY THAT IS A PROBLEM TO WHICH ADMINISTRATION- TO TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE APPEALING THE DECISION. BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION BUT MORE IMPORTANT WHY. ARE WE PROVIDING BODY CAMERAS DISAGREED START AT ONE FACILITY BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS IT AND SO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM IF THERE'S A THERE'S A LOGICAL REASON. HOPEFULLY BETTER THAN ONE THAT I WAS GIVEN THAT SHE PRISON GUARDS CAN JUST TURN THE CAMERAS OFF. MY ANSWER WAS. YOU DO KNOW THEY MAKE. CAMERAS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN'T TURN OFF SO. LET ME KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR BOTH SIDES IN THE INSTABILITY. SOB LEAVE IT UP TO YOU WHETHER YOU WANT TO COME TO MY OFFICE WE WANNA DO IT AND- END UP BUT JUST A FIVE. MINUTE PENALTY HOURS LATE. SO YEAH I THINK THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- I THINK I CAN ANSWER ONE RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS THE- YEAH THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN TRIGGER CUTS FOR THE COURTS. AND WE HAVE A THREE POINT 7% INCREASE IN THE CURRENT. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT BRINGS IT UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION SO JUST THAT'S- THAT THE COURTS ARE ALSO LOOKING AT EFFICIENCIES TO PREFER SAVINGS- AND ARE THE OTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU. WE CAN HAVE- STAFF REPUBLICAN REJECT YOUR STAFF AND SET UP. MEETINGS FOR FOLLOW UP. AND SO IN ON THE COURT THE ONE YOU DID ANSWER IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'LL MAKE THEM WHOLE BLOOD TO RUN INTO MY OFFICE AFTER I GET OUT OF HERE. AND SAY THEY'RE NOT BEING MADE WHOLE BUTTE. WELL I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE NOT REVISITING THE TRIGGER CUTS AND THAT WAY I THINK. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INCREASES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TRIAL COURT AS WELL AS YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU WERE PROVIDED. ADDITIONAL A FUNDING- BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING- DOESN'T EXACTLY MATCH UP TO THOSE TRIGGER CUTS- BUT BUT THERE ARE. THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP AND SUPPORT THOSE- ENTITIES. BLACKROCK I'M OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE THE MONEY THAT THEY WANTED BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE. I MADE SURE THEY GOT IT BACK BUT IT MAY REFLECT JUVENILE COURTS- TEEN COURTS ARE DRUG COURT VETERANS COURTS HOMELESS COURTS. AND THAT'S HOW WE GAVE THE MONEY BACK SO IT. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF DOING IT THE SAME WAY. SO THE I'M GOOD WITH THAT. THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER LEE AND THEN MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE WILL SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE DURING A VERY CHALLENGING TIME I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S EMPHASIS ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY THOSE THE TOPICS THAT W HOPE TO DEL I HOPE TO DELVIN IN FUTURE HEARINGS. OF WHAT I WANT TO ASK AND RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES IS ONLY ONE QUESTION AND IT IS ABOUT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR SAY FREE OPENING DURING SCHOOLS I'M GONNA PREFERENCE AS TO WHY I ASK THIS QUESTION BUT ANSWER FIRST OR I'LL ASK IT FIRST AND ELABORATE ON IT. HE'S IN THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL THE INCENTIVE GRANTS THERE IS THE DATES OF FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH AND MARCH FIFTEENTH FOR RESPECTIVE GRADES TO MEET THESE PLANS. NOW I AM CONCERNED THAT IT CREATES AN ARTIFICIAL PRESSURE POINT AN ARTIFICIAL DEADLINE FOR SCHOOLS TO BE MEETING THESE PLANS AS A LABORATORY A LAB RATED BY MANY MY COLLEAGUES SAFETY OPENING IS A HUGE PRIORITY NOT OFFER CONSTITUENTS. ARE EDUCATORS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT I AM VERY WORRIED THAT WE ARE. MOTIVATING A PLAN BY THE CALENDAR AND NOT BY THE SCIENCE OR DATA SHOWING WE ARE CURRENTLY APPROACHING THE THIRTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE STATE. WE ARE IN WHAT SOME OF THE DARKEST PERIOD OF THIS CRISIS OF THIS PANDEMIC. WITHOUT AND PERHAPS HOPEFULLY WILL GET BETTER EVEN THOUGH THE VACCINE IS ROLLING OUT RIGHT NOW. AND JUST AS AN ILLUSTRATION IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IT USED TO BE THAT WHEN YOU HIT READ HERE YOU CAN MAKE A PLAN FOR TWO WEEKS AND THEN REOPEN THE SCHOOLS. WELL THE ENTIRE STATE IS ESSENTIALLY IN SUCH A DEEP PURPLE THAT WE HAVE RUN OUT OF COLORS. THAT WE ARE IN SUCH A DEEP STATE. THAT I AM REALLY AFRAID THAT WE ARE MOVING. THAT WE'RE MOVING INTO A STATE WHERE- ARE MOTIVATED BY THE DATE RATHER THAN WHAT THE SCIENCE IS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING. SO IT IS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO ALL OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND TO US. THAT THE SAFETY OF THE EDUCATORS OF THE STUDENTS AND THE FAMILIES ARE PRIORITIZE WHEN WE ARE REOPENING THE SCHOOLS. SO THAT'S REALLY MY QUESTION IS. WHY ARE WE PUTTING THE PRESSURE DATE OF FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH AND MARCH. AS I FAVOR SIXTEENTH AND MARCH FIFTEENTH. TO PRESSURE THE SCHOOLS TO MAKE THESE PLANS WHEN IN FACT WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT CONSULTATION. IS IT. BY FEDERAL LAW IS THERE SOMETHING DICTATING THAT WORRIES THAT A PERIOD. IN WHICH WE CAN NEGOTIATE AND FIGURE OUT SO LET'S NOT ARTIFICIAL PRESSURE POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. I'M I THINK THE DATE- ILLUSTRATES THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER- AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION SEES IT- THAT SAID AGAIN- I THINK THIS IS A POINT OF CONVERSATION. AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN WITH- SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND TRADE TRYING TO INFORM THE PLAN BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR. THE FEEDBACK AND SO I THINK THAT MORE CONVERSATIONS NEED TO HAPPEN. REGARDING THE PROPOSAL AS A WHOLE. I THANK YOU FOR BEING OF THE FEEDBACK AND REALLY HOPE THEY'LL KEEP CONSULTING THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE. IN MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO FEEL THAT THE SCHOOLS MUST MAKE AN IMPROPER INAPPROPRIATE PLAN TO GET THE MONEY BECAUSE- SCHOOL REOPENING SAFELY IS A HUGE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW. SO OFTEN THE FEEDBACK AND WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU WERE GONNA GO MISSED MCCARTY IN THE MISS RUBIO. THANK YOU JUST SOME OVERALL COMMENTS AND LATE IN THE DAY- ON THE BUDGET IN EDUCATION BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I WANTED TO. JUST ADD ON TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA CHAIR OF STEP THREE TALKED ABOUT. THE MONIES FOR OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT IS A FABULOUS USE OF ONE TIME MONEY- THE GOVERNOR IS BEING LAUDED BY USING ONE TIME MONEY- WITH THIS. SURPLUS FOR ONE TIME PURPOSES WE KNOW THAT IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE LOOK AT THE WILD FIRES WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE. ISSUE AS HE SAID IT'S MOBILE SOURCES AND CARS WE KNOW WE WANT TO GET MORE. ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WHAT DO YOU NEED ME MORE INFRASTRUCTURE SO. I'D LIKE TO USE THAT MONEY TO DRESS ARE ISSUES LIKE ADDICTION HOMELESSNESS AND SO FORTH BUT THOSE REQUIRE. LONG UNDERGOING EXPENDITURES AND THIS IS A ONE TIME POT SO THIS IS A OF A PEACE OF MIND IT. IS AN APPROPRIATE- ALLOCATION THE BUDGET I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MR RAMA SAYS OF COURSE SACRAMENTO OUR INDUSTRY HERE IS STATE CAPITOL STATE GOVERNMENT SO OUR STATE WORKERS I TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A HAIR CUT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT REVISITING THAT ON THE EDUCATION BUDGET WE'LL GET AT THIS IN GREATER DETAIL SB TO IN THE COMING MONTHS BUT- OVERALL IT'S A REALLY POSITIVE BUDGET FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. THAT'S ALWAYS OUR TOP PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY OUR TOP PER DURING KOBE TO GET OUR STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL IN A SAFE MANNER. I DO WANT TO NOTE TWO COMMENTS BRIEFLY ON THE- THE PROPOSAL- I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES TALK ABOUT THAT AT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THING IT'S NOT. NECESSARILY DOABLE WE DON'T WANT THIS MONEY JUST TO GO AS A WINDFALL TO THE WEALTHY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE APPROPRIATE COLORS WE WANT US TO BE UTILIZED TO MAKE SURE. IT WORKS AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF TO BILLIONS RIGHT NUMBER IF YOU LOOK AT A BUDGET FOR SCHOOLS IT'S YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE LOCAL AND- FEDERAL STATE MONEY NOR NEARLY A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS TWO BILLION GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY ACTOR NOT. I AM ALSO CONCERNED TOO. THAT THERE MAY BE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO NOTHING- WHEN THEY GET TO THE APPROPRIATE COLOR. NOT PURPLE BUT EITHER RED. OR ORANGE- I'D LIKE TO REVISIT MAYBE SOME TYPE OF REQUIREMENT. THAT IF THEY'RE IN THE APPROPRIATE SMALLER COHORTS LIKE WE HEAR FROM. THE EDUCATORS THAT WE HAVE SOMETIME A REQUIREMENT THAT WE DO GET SOME- INSTRUCTION OTHERWISE. THIS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING LAS BRIDGET WILL JUST EXASPERATED SPECIALLY SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES WERE STUDENTS ALREADY. I LEFT BEHIND- SOME SOME SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS THAT WE WENT TO ADDRESS IN THE EARLY EDUCATION SPACE AND OF. MY COLLEAGUE WHO LEFT ALREADY MISS REYES MENTION THIS. THE ADDITIONAL SLOTS ARE POSITIVE WITH THE PROP SIXTY FOUR- MARIJUANA TAX MONEY WE APPRECIATE THAT FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED BUT THERE'S STILL. A GREAT NEED AS WELL AS THE RATE REFORM. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN- FINANCIALLY ON THE BUBBLE. EVEN MORE SO IT BECAUSE OF IT AND SO HAVING- WORKERS THAT CAN CERTAINLY LEAVING GETTING MAKE MORE IN N. OUT BURGER COSCO- WHY WOULD THEY STAY WORKING IN THE- IN THE CHILD CARE FIELD WE GET. SO MUCH OF THIS TURN OVER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ADDRESS THAT AND TAKE CARE OF OUR THEY DID THE WORK FORCE THERE WHO OBVIOUSLY WE NOW. ARE PROFOUNDLY WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR- LASTLY I JUST WENT ON THE U. C. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M VERY EXCITED THE GOVERNOR- PRIORITIZE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WHICH IS A BILL THAT I'M WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THIS COULD BE THE FINALLY THE YEAR THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR ALL THREE FOUR YEAR OLDS. PRE K. IN CALIFORNIA. WE THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND ALLOWS US TO. UTILIZE OTHER MONIES TO. BOOST OPPORTUNITIES FOR ZERO THREE THREE AS WELL SO WE THINK IT'S A WIN WIN WIN LOOKING AT. AS THE GOVERNOR ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT THE WHOLE CHILD- OVER ALSO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY POSITIVE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE HIGHER END. PIECES AS WELL- YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT IS. THE UC AND CSU. ARE SAYING THAT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THE- ADDRESS FOR THE CUTS TOOK LAW YEAR- WE DON'T KNOW IF THE FEDERAL MONEY COMING IN IS. THAT CAN BACK FILL THAT TO MAKE THOSE SYSTEMS HOLE BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK AT THE HIGHER RATE NEEDS. WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR FOCUSES ON FINANCIAL AID SIGNIFICANTLY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE HURTING. ONE ISSUE THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO GET IN HIS COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. OLDER MANY TIMES WITH FAMILIES. THOSE ARE THE STUDENTS WE THOUGHT TAKE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM GOING TO COLLEGE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WHEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM HELP THEM. GET BACK TO THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION A STUDY SO. WILL CERTAINLY ENGAGE OF THIS IN THE SUB TO PROCESS IN THE COMING MONTHS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO. MISS RUBIO AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TOUGH WORK AHEAD- BUT I DID HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION REGARDING- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IS OUR EARLIER. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE- YOU STATED THAT- THEIR WORDS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW LONG THE CONVERSATIONS WERE- WHEN YOU HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. HI I'M GONNA TURN THAT TOO DIFFICULT. HI JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I CAN SPEAK TO THOSE MEETINGS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF AND WE SPEAK WITH MANY SUPERINTENDENTS- AS PART OF LARGER CONVENING- I KNOW THAT MANY THE SUPERINTENDENTS IN THE STATE ALSO SPEAK WITH OUR- STAFF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THOSE MEETINGS SPECIFICALLY BUT I'M IN MANY OF THE VENUES THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE SUPERINTENDENT'S IT'S BEEN AN HOUR TWO HOURS- DEPENDING ON WHAT THE VENUE IS. NO I'M SPECIFICALLY ASKING ABOUT THE PROPOSALS- THAT YOU STATED EARLIER YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT'S PRIOR TO RELEASING THE- THE PROJECT OR THE INFORMATION ON- FOR THE SCHOOLS. I CAN'T SPEAK TO ANY SPECIFIC MEETINGS I'VE BEEN HAD THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN A PART OF I KNOW THAT THERE WERE MANY MEETINGS WITH GOVERNOR'S OFFICE STAFF AS WELL STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION STUFF. RIGHT WILL BUT THAT'S HE QUESTION WITH- WHEN MY OUR COLLEAGUE- STATED THAT WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD NOT HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS. YOU SAID YES BUT NOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONVERSATIONS. THAT THERE WERE MORE WOMEN. THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE RESERVATIONS BUT YOU WERE NOT PART OF ANY OF THEM. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SPOKEN WITH THE SUPERINTENDENTS AND- WORK WITH THEM PRIOR TO PUTTING OUT THE PROPOSAL. I PERSONALLY WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL CONVERSATIONS I CAN'T SPEAK TO THOSE. OKAY WELL THEN AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF INPUT DID YOU GET FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT'S. SO THE SUPERINTENDENTS DISCUSSED AND SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT THEY'RE FACING IN TERMS OF RE OPENING AND CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD AROUND- SAFETY AND WHAT SOME OF THEIR NEEDS FOR. BUT IT'S NOT THE INPUT THATWAS- UP WORKED INTO THE PROPOSAL. YES THOSE FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE WE'VE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM MANY NOT JUST SUPERINTENDENTS THE OTHER FOLKS- IN THE EDUCATION FIELD AROUND I'M NEEDING MORE CLARITY AROUND TESTING- NEEDING MORE SUPPORT AROUND TESTING WHICH THE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES- AND ADDITIONALLY NEEDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MEET SOME OF THE NEEDS- AROUND HEALTH AND SAFETY. OKAY WELL THEN THE THIRD QUESTION IS- DID YOU PROVIDE THE PROPOSAL A DRAFT OF THE PROPOSAL PRIOR TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS SO THAT THEY COULD- LOOK AT THE INFORMATION PRIOR TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. ARE WITHOUT OBJECTION. YES SO AGAIN I'M I WAS NOT PART OF THOSE SPECIFIC CONVERSATION SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT- I KNOW THAT- AT THE VERY LEAST- THE PROPOSALS WERE DISCUSSED AND OVERS DOOMBEN CALLS I DON'T KNOW IF PAPER WAS. RIGHT IN THE REASONS ACT- WE BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SUPERINTENDENTS THAT WERE FRUSTRATED I. ONLY HAVE ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY'RE NOT THE BIG. OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE LAUSD BUT WE DID HAVE A CONVERSATION AS PART O THE L. A. COUNTY CAUCUS- SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT- SUPERINTENDENT PETER AND HE SAID THAT THERE WERE NO CONVERSATIONS. ON THAT THEY HAD A CALL A FIFTEEN MINUTE CALL AND THAT THERE WAS NO NOTHING PROVIDED TO THEM- IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE INPUT. AND THE REASON THAT I'M I'M YOU KNOW BRING THESE ISSUES UP IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOLKS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE- THEY WERE PART OF THE PROCESS AND THE REALITY IS THAT THEY WEREN'T. I'M NOT HEARING ANY. KIND OF INFORMATION FROM THE RESPONSES AS TO THEM BEING PART OF THIS WHOLE ENTIRE PROCESS- I CAN TELL YOU AS A FORMER TEACHER AND A FULL FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS DON'T HAPPEN- WHAT HAPPENS IS. THE STAKEHOLDERS IF YOU WILL ARE NOT- PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND THEREFORE CANNOT YOU KNOW PROPERLY IMPLEMENT ANY PROPOSALS OR ANY KIND OF- POLICIES THAT WE PUT FORWARD TO THEM SO. I'M MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT WE GET GENERAL- RESPONSES AND IN REALITY I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO HERE AND TRY TO BE. HELPFUL TO THE PROCESS BY WHEN WE DON'T HEAR ACTUAL FACTS AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M WASTING MY TIME I DON'T WANT TO WASTE MY TIME I WANT TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT. OF THIS BOB WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IF WE DON'T GET CORRECT INFORMATION THEN YOU'RE JUST THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL EMAIL ME THE INFORMATION. I AM HEARING FROM MY SUPERINTENDENTS- SPECIFICALLY MY DISTRICT WIDE ALLEY UST OF NOT IN MY DISTRICT HOWEVER I AM PART OF THE ALLEY- DELEGATION AND WHEN THEY'RE FRUSTRATED I CAN ONLY ASSUME. THAT THE OTHER SUPERINTENDENTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE I AGAIN I CAN SPEAK FROM MY OWN SUPERINTENDENTS AND THEY'RE ALL FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE GETTING IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO- ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN. AND THE I FEEL LIKE EVERY SINGLE DAY OR EVERY. WEEK THEY'RE HAVING TO YOU KNOW REINVENT SOMETHING WAS- SENT OVER BY THE- ADMINISTRATION AND- SO I ASK. I AM PLEASED THAT WHEN WE ASK QUESTIONS PLEASE HAVE SPECIFIC ANSWERS NOT GENERAL ANSWERS AS TO YOU KNOW THERE WERE MANY CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING. THAT'S NOT HELPFUL WHEN WE HAVE TO RETURN TO OUR DISTRICTS. AND REPORT BACK AS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING- AS PART OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- FOR EXAMPLE TODAY- I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL TANGIBLE INFORMATION I CAN BE TRYING TO THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ALL I CAN SAY IS PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US. MY JOB AS AS I SEE IT IS TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR. NOT JUST MIGHT THE SUPERINTENDENT OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY AREA BY TWO FOR THE WHOLE STATE AND IF I'M NOT. GETTING THAT INFORMATION FROM MY BUDGET PROCESS THEN THEN I CAN JUST SEND THEM THE BUDGET AND SAY YOU KNOW HERE READ IT- I THOUGHT THE PURPOSE OF THESE. HEARINGS IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE A DIALOGUE TO WHERE WE CAN TAKE BACK TO OUR DISTRICT SPECIFIC INFORMATION. AGAIN I CAN READ THE YOU KNOW THE BUDGET AND I CAN HAVE THEM READ IT BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THESE HEARINGS. SO I AM FRUSTRATED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE I CANNOT RESPOND TO MY SUPERINTENDENTS. BY MOVING FORWARD SINCE IS OUR FIRST- BUDGET HEARING I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU HOW TO BETTER ASK QUESTIONS TO GET THOSE DIRECT THEM FROM A- DIRECT. OUT RESPONSES AS OPPOSED TO SOME GENERAL COMMENTS THAT DO US- NO GOOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS OUT ON THE FOR THE TWO BILLION. AND WE LOOK FOR TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND- THAT THE BACK AND FORTH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT HOWEVER THE FRUSTRATION IS WITH WITHIN THE ACTUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE TO- FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS- AND SOLD. IT FOR FUTURE- I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT AGAIN PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME SOME GENERAL INFORMATION AS TO WE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS. I WOULD LIKE SOME SPECIFICS AS TO YOU KNOW WHO YOU SPOKE WITH AND WHEN AND HOW LONG AND- WHAT- WHAT ROLLED IT. PLAY BEST AS INPUT INTO THE POLICIES AND THE BUDGET. TRAILER THAT WE'RE PUTTING DOWN AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY CAN BEST. USE THAT MONEY TO SUPPORT OUR OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE. AND I DON'T NEED TO SEE IT AGAIN BUT I WILL ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF OUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST GET UP BURKE JUST QUICK COMMENT TO MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE ALSO THERE'S SOME I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO IF THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU COULD PUT THAT IN WRITING IN THE SYSTEM TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE COULD APPRECIATE THAT I THINK FROM NOT JUST ON THEIR END BROADER COMMITTEE BUT ALSO FOR. SUB TO AS WE DELVE INTO THIS ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE TAKING WERE ASK TO BE CONSIDERING. TAKING EARLY ACTION THIS MATTER THANK YOU- WE WILL NOW GO TO THIS- BY THEIR FIRST NAME TO THE LIST TO BETTER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS VERY CRITICAL BUDGET DURING WHAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING RIGHT NOW- THIS IS OUR BUDGET. THIS IS MASSIVE. THERE IS NO NETFLIX FOR ME THIS PAST WEEKEND. NOW WHAT I'M FEARFUL OF IS THAT WE ARE OF NOT PRIORITIZING SOME KEY ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY IN THE THIRTIETH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. MY KEY QUESTIONS AROUND PRIORITIES ARE AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS THAT THIS HAS THIS ISSUE HAS COME UP JUST YET. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE AND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDING TO THE BACK DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS- WHO HAVE REALLY BEEN HIT HARD THIS PANDEMIC. SO AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. THERE'S ONE THING THAT IS CLEARLY MISSING FROM THIS BUDGET AND NOT HIS PRIDE TO PRIORITIZING THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED AND REALLY ENDANGERED BY PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. AND THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET THERE WERE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO COW- THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF ADMINISTERING GRANTS TO CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND TRIBES TO HELP PROVIDE RELIEF RESULTING FROM PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HIT MY DISTRICT HARD. THERE'S BEEN DOZENS OF PUBLIC A P. S. P. ADVANCE SINCE NOVEMBER. ON THANKSGIVING DAY AND CHRISTMAS DAY. IN THE WINTER IN MY DISTRICT AND I WOULD IMAGINE A MOST DISTRICTS THE SUN GOES DOWN EARLY. AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS IN OUR CITIES I'M GETTING CALLS FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT ARE SAYING THAT IT'S DARK AND THE POWER SHUT OFF AND INTERSECTIONS ARE BLACK WHEN PEOPLE ARE WALKING THROUGH AND PEOPLE ARE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. CAN YOU LET ME KNOW GIVEN THAT P. S. P. S. EVENTS ARE HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY WHY DOES THIS BUDGET NOT INCLUDE BETTER FUNDING TO EQUIP OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE NECESSITIES AND THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. AND THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS WELL. SURE SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF GOOD THINGS THAT COULD BE IN THIS BUDGET AND- AS I SAID BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A. COMING TO- A MUTUAL AGREEMENT ON WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE SO THAT'S GENERALLY FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU DON'T SEE IN THERE I'M NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE IMPORTANT IMPORTANT BUT I THINK- WE NEED TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THAT RIGHT SO WHY WAS THE DECISION MADE TO CUT THE FUNDING AS WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE MORE SHORT OFFICE THAN WE HAVE IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AND I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR- FUNDING STREAM- OR ITEM SO I CAN HELP TO GET BACK TO YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND THE BUDGET I WANT TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR THE BUDGET DOES HAVE I'M SO REALLY GOOD PROVISIONS THERE'S FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE VOUCHERS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS TO HELP DEVELOP EARLY EDUCATOR PROFESSIONALS QUALITY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. WELL THESE ARE ALL GREAT PROGRAMS IT'S MY IMPRESSION THAT THE PAROLE PROPOSAL PROVIDES TOO LITTLE AND THE FORM OF IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR PROVIDERS AND FOR PARENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING NOW TO OPERATE DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. WHAT IT NEARLY I COME FROM A CHILD CARE- INDUSTRY BACKGROUND. AND THIS PANDEMIC WERE EXPECTED TO LOSE A THIRD IF NOT HALF OF THE INDUSTRY THREE THOUSAND LICENSED CHILD CARE. FAMILY PROVIDERS AND CENTERS HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AN EARLIER YOU SAID THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS LASER FOCUSED ON CREATING JOBS. AND WE CANNOT MISS THE STEP OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORK FORCE HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION. AT THAT IS TRULY A PRIORITY SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE IN THE BUDGET ARE THERE PROVISIONS TO PROVIDE RELIEF. FOR ESSENTIAL CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND SPECIFICALLY. WHAT ALLOCATIONS ARE MADE. FOR MIDDLE CLASS WORKING FAMILIES THERE ARE LOTS OF FUNDING AND RESOURCES- BUT TYPICALLY NOT FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO DON'T QUALIFY SO WHAT SPECIFICALLY WILL MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. QUALIFY FOR IN TERMS OF CHILD CARE. THANK YOU THE ONE THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT FIRST IS THAT WE ARE EXPECTING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON CHILD CARE- WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE- THAT INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE YET BUT I THINK TO YOUR POINT. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH APLAN ON HOW TO GET ALLOCATED TO MEET SOME OF THOSE NEEDS- I WILL HAVE TO TURN OVER THE REST OF YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT'S INCLUDED- IN THE BUDGET FOR THE SPECIFICS SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO FROM ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES. THE FINANCE. YEAH YEAH YOU PROBABLY. HI JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I CAN SPEAK TO- SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS BOTH ON THE EDUCATION SIDE AS WELL AS THE US DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE AND HAVE WON MY COLLEAGUES PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION IF NECESSARY ON THE PERMISSIBLE SERVICES SIDE. FOR CHILD CARE THE DE IN ADDITION TO THE- THE FUNDING FOR THE SLOTS IS AS YOU MENTIONED I'M WITH THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOUR AND- PROVIDER M. KOPA NINETEEN. SUPPORT AND- WE ARE STILL WORKING ON THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- AROUND FOR HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED- IN ADDITION WE HAVE- SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON THE T. CASE SIDE- WHICH PROVIDES AND PRESCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES- FOR CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF INCOME- SO THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION WOULD BE A REALLY FOCUSED ON THE PROVIDER SIDE OF THINGS. AND THEN THE TEACHING LESSONS WOULD REALLY BE FOCUSED ON- THE PRESCHOOL ACCESS- FOR A BROAD RANGE OF FEELINGS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS. GREAT THANK YOU AND ZERO TO FOUR ZERO TO THREE. CHILD CARE ESERVER RESOURCES WELL THERE. SO THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE FAMILIES WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THAT THE FUNDS PROVIDED- FOR INCREASED LOTS OF THE CANNABIS FUNDS- THOSE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY AGE- FORWARD THAT TO CASE PFIZER MAJORITY FOR AND FOCUS ON FOUR YEAR OLD- AND THEN THE FUNDS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- WOULD BE AT YOU KNOW GETTING. TV DION ON THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR THOSE ONE THING I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT IN OCTOBER THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE FORM OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- TO BACK FILLED THE REDUCTION OF- FAMILY FEES FOR PROVIDERS THAT THAT WE WAVE. AND THEN IN ADDITION ANOTHER EIGHTY MILLION TO FURTHER FUND- THE INCREASED COST OF CARE ASSOCIATED- WITH SERVING SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AS WELL AS EXTEND- THE TEMPORARY SLOTS PROVIDED FOR SOCIAL WORKER FAMILIES. GREAT THANK YOU AND MY LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE RESOURCES AND THE BUDGET- I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT RESOURCES IN THE BUDGETS ARE BEING ALLOCATED. IN PREVIOUS YEARS THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND RAPE CRISIS CENTERS NOW WE KNOW THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED THE PERFECT STORM IN WHICH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE IS ONLY INCREASING. SO IT IS VITAL AND IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING RESOURCES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE RE OPEN BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RETURN TRUE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE CASES THAT ARE HAPPENING SO. IN THE BUDGET WHAT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED. CAN I TURN THAT OVER TO ONE OF MY EIGHTY JUST. THIS IS ADAM DORSEY DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE. ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES THAT IS- THERE ARE TWO- HELP RESPOND TO URGENT AND CRITICAL NEED TO BE GOT OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- OPERATED BY THE COUNTIES- THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW CAN RESPOND- YOU KNOW IN IN CASES OF CRISIS- AND- IN THE HOMES PER IN THE- COVERAGE PROGRAM WE HAVE- YOU KNOW HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FOR EMERGENCY NEEDS. AND SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF AREAS- AND THEN YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THOSE ARE THOSE OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THEN. WE'VE MADE INVESTMENTS IN THIS BUDGET- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT A FEW TIMES NOW- THE MENTAL HEALTH PROPOSAL- TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW MAKE THOSE SYSTEMS MORE ROBUST AND SO- THOSE ARE SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KIND OF CORE PROGRAMS IN IN RECENT INVESTMENTS IN IN THAT AREA. SO THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE AND RAPE CENTER SPECIFICALLY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT- AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT BUT I THINK THAT- UNLESS THERE'S SOMEONE HERE THAT CAN ANSWER IT WE WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU GONNA GO MISTER BENNETT. AND THEN I GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON THE OF BUDGET COMMITTEE DURING THESE TRYING- IN CHALLENGING TIMES- AND SUBSEQUENT TO VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; INDICATING&lt;/c&gt; TO CHAIRMAN KIDDING THAT I HAD A QUESTION ONE OF MY QUESTIONS MY QUESTION WAS ASKED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SO I HAVE NO QUESTION FOR THE L. L. A. STAFF FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STAFF. BUT I WILL JUST MAKE ONE BRIEF COMMENT AND THAT IS THAT. THE WINDOW TO TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS FAST CLOSING. AND AS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM STATED WE NEED TO MAKE A STEADY COMMITMENT TO REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS. AND TO ADDRESSING WILDFIRES. AND I ENCOURAGE ALL OF US INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR- FOR TO BUILD THE POLITICAL SUPPORT THAT WE NEED. SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE STEADY AND SUSTAINABLE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING SOURCE AND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES. IN THE BUDGET SO WE CAN MAKE THAT STEADY COMMITMENT THAT WE REALLY DID IT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE AN THAT IS ESSENTIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU SIR- COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO START WITH. HELLO ON IN JUSTIFY YOU COULD EXPAND AND FEEL FREE TO HAVE YOUR STAFF EXPAND. AT THE UC SAID IN YOUR HIGHLIGHTS AROUND THE SCHOOL OPENING PROPOSAL YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE- TIME LINES THAT WERE SENT AND THEN ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ON YOU OR YOUR STAFF COMMENTS AROUND THE TAX REFUND PROPOSAL HOW THAT COULD BE. A MORE TARGETED AND ALSO- DID WANT TO HEAR WHETHER THE STAFF DID LOOK AT THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AND WHETHER THERE COULD BE A FURTHER TARGETING OF THOSE- PROPOSAL THAT PROPOSAL AS WELL. YES MISTER THANK YOU- ON THE- SCHOOL RE OPENING I THINK- I WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUE EDGAR CABRAL HE'S ON TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON OUR THINKING AROUND THAT. RALPH IN THE STUDIO WITH OFFICE FROM EMPLOYMENT. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. BERKELEY TALKING YOU SHOULD ON THE SCREEN. OKAY GREAT-I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO START BURBANK COMMENTS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THAT'S- IF CONVICTED PROPOSAL HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN I COMPLETED AND- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR UNIONS BY. FEBRUARY FIRST- AND- THAT WOULD BE BASED ON SOME ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED UNDERSTANDING IT SHOULD BE RELEASED- AND THINGS. LIKE IT'S VERY VERY SHORT WINDOW FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THAT BOB THOSE PLANS AND THEN BEGINNING WITHIN TWO WEEKS FILE TO BE OPENED SCHOOLS BUT THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE'VE HEARD IT AGAIN THIS GRANT IS NOT AVAILABLE YET SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE LISTING CADENCES. BUT THE TESTING AT THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT MAYBE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS MIGHT NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO PUT THAT ON THE MOST OF IT BUT THEY COULD BRING STUDENTS BACK A LEVEL THAT IS EXPECTED IN THE PROPOSAL. SO THAT'S OUR OUR MAIN CONCERN WE REYES- ONE ALTERNATIVE IN OUR OLD REWARDS TO- SLOW DOWN THAT EVEN A LITTLE BIT SO THAT MAYBE A MISSILE REQUIREMENTS IT'S NOT ALL TO GIVE TO STUDENTS BUT BROKE UP OF A HIGHER NEED STUDENTS COMING FIRST. SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN GET UP AND RUNNING- DON'T LOOK AROUND CITY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THOSE STUDENTS- AND THEN I WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR RAMPING UP AND I THINK ALSO SIMILARLY I THINK WE HAVE SOME. CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAPACITY FOR BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF SUPPORT MIGHT NOT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF- HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME. TO DEVELOP PLANS TO GET UP AND RUNNING RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU JUST A IT'S THE BY HAVE YOU A FOLLOW UP WHAT IT WHAT DID YOU. OF THAT WERE SENT OVER BY THE LARGE DISTRICT- OUTLINING FOR OF THEIR- THERE CAN. YEAH SURE WE DID REGULAR. CLARITY UNDER OF HOW THE WORK I THINK THAT LED DID THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICT WERE IN ARAB GOING DEEPER WOULDN'T ABLE TO FOR GOING I THINK MY UNDERSTAND OF DIMINISH PROPOSAL THAT ARE THOSE DISTRICTS ONE BE ABLE TO FOR ONE THEY WOULD BE TO BE MADE THOSE- AGAIN. AND THEY WERE RECEIVE FUNDING AND YEAH IS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BEGIN TO OPEN UP TO OBEY THE CASES IN THOSE COUNTIES WERE AT LEVELS THAT WOULD GIVE YOU THE PROGRAM- SO THAT'S ONE THING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT I THINK REGULAR THOSE CONCERNS A LOOK I THINK IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING SIDE I THINK WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT TESTING REQUIREMENTS I THINK THERE'S A BIG- I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CHANCES AND TRYING TO ASSESS THE FISCAL COSTS OF THIS PROPOSAL. IF IT'S FOR EXAMPLE ALMOST EVERYBODY BECAUSE ONCE A WEEK I CAN BE A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL COST- BUT I REMEMBER THERE WAS SIX BILLION IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING PROVIDED- IN THIS LAST BUDGET IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL. ABOUT SIX BILLION COMING- SO WE THINK THAT THERE ARE BE SOME RESOURCES THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE WITHOUT I THINK OUR CONCERNS. HELLO OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE NOT REALLY JUST BECAUSE HAWKINS TO JUST GREAT KID- SCHOOL DISTRICTS. YOUR HONOR CAN ENSURE THE THEY CAN GET. ON THAT MEAN TIMES DONE IN TIME IT'S- ARE YOU JUST CONCERNS BY COST- I JUST JUMPED. THE IN A PLACE THAT THE BIG- THAT I WE SHOULD MOST CONCERN. THAT. I AM YOU HAVE TO DO THIS VERY VERY QUICKLY SO WE CAN START YOUR REQUEST ONLINE AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RE OPEN FOR AWHILE UNTIL- CASES COME DOWN TO THE LEVEL THAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE SO. ANOTHER REASON TO. A GIVEN. HOW MUCH CAPACITY YOU'RE STRANGE RIGHT NOW- PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT MORE TO MAKE MAKE IT MORE FEASIBLE FOR EVERYONE. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY AND THEN- TAKE YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS ON THE- GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS CHECKS AND ONE OF THE THOUGHTS THAT WE HAD ABOUT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW EARLIER IN THE SPRING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS TO MOST TAXPAYERS MORE RECENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER ROUND OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECKS WHICH IS THE SAME AMOUNT THAT'S GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL. ONE GROUP OF TAXPAYERS THAT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THOSE- THOSE FEDERAL BENEFITS HAVE BEEN TO THOSE FOLKS THAT FILE THEIR TAXES WITH I TEN- YOU KNOW- UNDER THE I. TEN PROCESS. AND SO- YOU KNOW ONE TIME WE HAD AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER WOULD BE TO- PROVIDE THE STIMULUS- THE GOLDEN STATE PAYMENTS TARGETED MORE AT THOSE TAXPAYERS THAT HAVE NOT- SO FAR BENEFITTED FROM THOSE FEDERAL PAYMENTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUSLY EXPANDED THE EITC PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE THOSE TAXPAYERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE- SOME OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS AND SO I THINK. IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE PUT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THE- SMALL BUSINESS- QUESTION I'M GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE. BRIAN YOU ARE COULD- HELP WITH THAT ONE. YES THANK YOU BRING YOU ARE AGAIN WITH THE L. A. O. YOU KNOW I THINK WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVES- THE MOMENT WERE WERE STARTING TO I JUST GETTING STARTED ANALYZING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS- WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE OF THE SHORT TIMELINE THAT THEY PROPOSE THESE GRANTS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION SO WE DO. WELL TO BE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF OVER THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS- HELP- IMPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND OFFER SOME ALTERNATIVES I THINK ONE THING THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT IS. GETTING THAT THE FUNDING THE GOVERNOR'S COMPOSING IS BUILDING ON THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS IT WAS ALREADY. APPROVED TO GO OUT- LAST FALL WILL BE YOU SEE WE CAN GET SOME PRELIMINARY DATA ON THAT- AND HOW THE ROLLOUT IS GOING AND WHO'S RECEIVING THAT MONEY- TO GAUGE WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD BE BETTER TARGETED IN THE FIRST ROUND. OKAY THANK YOU- SO JUST GOING BACK TO- GOING TO MISLEAD- I JUST WANT TO. GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL RE OPENING PROPOSAL- HEY CAN YOU TALK OF MAKING THIS HOMES COULD TALK ABOUT- THE MINDSET OF DOING AN INCENTIVE- GRANT BASED PROGRAM- HI I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR DISTRICTS TO APPLY. FOR THE GRANTS AND I AM CONCERNED THAT DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T. OPENED WILL NOT GET THE GRANTS OR BOMB WILL NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GRANT SO COULD YOU. COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH- WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY CLOSE WOULD ACTUALLY BE- PERSUADED TO APPLY AND THEN ALSO TO OPEN UP BECAUSE OF THIS. FUNDING SURE I'LL JUST START AND I WILL PROBABLY PUT THIS ONE TO JESSICA HOME- BUT AGAIN I THINK THE IMPORTANT. ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE THING IS TO HAVE THAT OPEN CONVERSATION TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMING THAT IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS- LIKE OTHER THINGS THE NEGOTIATION AND- WE ARE LISTENING AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE. THOSE NEEDS ARE AND- I THINK IT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT% SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS YOU SAY. SO JESSICA IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME DETAILS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CERTAINLY- SO I WOULD I WOULD I GUESS START OF MY COMMENTS BY GENOCIDE JUST COMPOUNDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD SORT OF MY COMMENTS BY JUST. PICKING UP I THINK WHERE MISLI LEFT OFF WHEN SHE SAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT FOR EVERY ALLEY I THINK THAT THAT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE'S IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION- AT THIS POINT. I THINK FOR FOLKS WHO- WHO ARE ALREADY OPEN FOR AN- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- CERTAINLY THIS IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL FOR THEM- BUT FOR FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN INDONESIA THE MAJORITY OF THESE FOLKS ARE ARE IN. COUNTIES THAT HAVE RATES THAT ARE ABOVE TWENTY EIGHT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND- THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE AS AS MR CABRAL MENTIONED. AND PART OF THIS IS- PROVIDING A SET OF GUIDANCE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE COME OUT PUBLICLY TOMORROW- IN LATER IN THE WEEK- ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE BUT- I'M PART. OF THE ROLLOUT OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE- IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SCHOOLS UNDERSTAND AND COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND THAT SCHOOLS KNOW HOW TO BE SAFE. EVEN WHEN WE HAVE YOU KNOW RELATIVELY HIGH TRANSMISSION RATES. I'M PART OF THE REASON WHY AND YOU SEE THE GROUND STRUCTURE AROUND AND THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IN THE COHORTS IS BECAUSE WE KNOW TAT THERE ARE LOWER TRANSMISSION RATES WITH THOSE STUDENTS. WE THINK THAT- THE TIMING- IS ACTUALLY A DOABLE FOR MANY L. A.'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT STARTING FROM ZERO GOING INTO THIS PROCESS MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN WORKING ON RE OPENING. SINCE LAST MARCH- AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THINGS LIKE TESTING CADENCES AND HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND HAVE BEEN- YOU KNOW. CONTINUES CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES ABOUT COMING BACK- THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT APPLICATION DATES A FEBRUARY FIRST ST IN THE MARCH FIRST AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR SOME ONLY IF IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. TO MEET THAT FEBRUARY FIRST DEADLINE- SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A MARCH DEADLINE. ONCE YOU GET OUT PASSED THOSE DEADLINES I'M IT GETS MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT- ED TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. AND SO WE REALLY FOCUSED ON- YOU KNOW TRYING TO UTILIZE AS MUCH OF THE REMAINING PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT WE HAVE THIS YEAR. AND REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THOSE WHO- AND WHO CAN GET. YOU KNOW MAKE IT OVER THAT THAT HURDLE- TO GET TO THAT POINT. I'M TO GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT EQUITY AND HOW WE ARE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED. BY THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM THESE FUNDS. YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IF YOU WERE ABOVE- THE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND THRESHOLD YOU CAN PARTICIPATE AND YOU CAN RECEIVE FUNDING. AND WE KNOW THAT- EVEN IF. YOU CANNOT OPEN FOR IN PERSON BECAUSE YOUR RATES DON'T GO DOWN BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS IS A REALLY EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY AND RESOURCES TO BEGIN PREPARING FOR THE SUMMER AND FALL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- HOPEFULLY WITHIN THIS YEAR WERE WERE PLANNING ON IN THE FALL TO BE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AGAIN. YOU KNOW THIS IS A FLUID SITUATION WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT FOR CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WE NEED TO START NOW. IN THIS CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING NOW AND COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE- BUT REST ASSURED THAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE OUT- IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE IS GOING TO KEEP THEIR STUDENTS SAFE. AND THOSE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT PIECES FOR MOST HARD HIT COMMUNITIES AND RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN USE AS THEY DO GO BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE SUMMER AND FALL. SO I EIGHT. WE REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS IS A PROPOSAL TO HAVE A LOT OF POSITIVES FOR EVERYONE. AND DOES HAVE A REALLY STRONG EQUITY FOCUS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT MANY MANY. ELEAZAR CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF. BUT BUSINESS HOMES COULD YOU ANSWER. IS WHAT'S THE COMPELLING PART OF THE PROPOSAL THAT WALL ON THIS- ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO APPLY AND THEN OPEN UP I DIDN'T I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR THAT. SO IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS THAT WERE PROPOSING- WHICH AGAIN ARE A PORTION OF OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDS THAT SCHOOLS ARE GETTING I THINK THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PIECES OF THIS- ARE THE NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE AGAIN WE KNOW THAT FOR A LOT OF ELEAZAR THE BARRIER IS. THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- WHEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS COME BACK SCHOOLS KNOW HOW TO BE SAFE IN THIS NEW GUIDANCE IS REALLY ABOUT PROVIDING THAT LEVEL OF COMFORT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN TRUST THAT THE SCHOOL- ENVIRONMENT IS A SAFE ONE WE ALSO HAVE- SELECTION OF AND- AS- HEALTH AND SAFETY- STUDIES ON CODED TO GO OUT TO KIND OF. GIVE OUR BACK UP ON WHAT THE- SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCES TO SUPPORT A PROPOSAL IN ADDITION WE HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP ALLEVIATE- WHO HAVE BARRIERS AROUND THINGS LIKE TESTING HOW DO THEY SET UP A TESTING- PROTOCOL WE HAVE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMING OUT THERE. SO REALLY WE HAVE MULTIPLE COLORS BUT RECALLING THEM TO TRY TO ADDRESS HESE BARRIERS THAT- ELEAZAR BRYN TENDANCE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FOLKS HAVE IDENTIFIED FOR US IS BEING BARRIERS TO GOING BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND THEN ON. HOW FOR HAVE THE NEW HOGAN FIFTY GARDENS GUIDELINES COME OUT. ARE THEY WILL BE OUT THIS WEEK THEY WILL BE ON DISPLAY OKAY YOUR GRIEF YES WE'VE BEEN HEARING THAT SINCE OUR HEARING TWO MONTHS AGO SO THEY ARE. COMING UP THIS WEEK. THEY ARE COMING OUT THIS WEEK. WHICH IS WHICH IS GREAT- I THINK THAT IS I COMPLETELY. AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT IS A CRITICAL. PIECE AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY DISTRICT BOTH LARGE AND SMALL. THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR- MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE AND IS IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE- DIRECTIVES RATHER THAN SORT OF. THE CURRENT GUIDANCE WHICH IS WHICH I WOULD I WOULD SORT OF. IS MORE LIKE A MENU OF OPTIONS. YEAH I'M YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SPEAK TO INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF THE GUIDANCE BUT I WILL SAY THAT THINGS LIKE TESTING CADENCES THOSE ARE VERY EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE GUIDANCE- AND WE DO REQUIRE THAT IF YOU DO PARTICIPATE IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT THAT YOU MUST PARTICIPATE IN THIS TESTING CADENCES- SO THAT THE FUNDING AND THE AND THE- THE GUIDANCE WORK TOGETHER- AND THAT AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN IN. PROVIDING YOU KNOW INCREASED- SAFETY. THANK THANK YOU AND THEN JUST JUST DUMB IN TERMS OF THE GRANTS VERSUS JUST APPROPRIATIONS WALKED. WATER WHY MAKE DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRAPPED FOR TIME ACTUALLY. APPLY FOR THIS ONE I JUST GIVEN THE MONEY IF THEY ACTUALLY PERFORM ACT YOU KNOW A. B. C. TASKS. THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE- AND SHOULD NOT BE AN OVERLY CUMBERSOME- I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE- NEXT FEW DAYS THAT WE'VE HAD THE LANGUAGE OUT IS YOU KNOW. GETTING AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONTRACTS DONE- BUT ALL THAT A LED HAS TO DO IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS IS PROVIDE A COPY OF THEIR SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN- AS WELL AS THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT TO THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- BY THE DATE SPECIFIED IF THEY DO THAT THEY'RE DONE THEY'RE APPLIED TO COUNTY OFFICE WILL SEND INTO CVD. AND CVD WILL PROVIDE THEM- WITH THE GRANT AMOUNT VERY IN IN A MATTER OF WEEKS SO IT'S A VERY QUICK PROCESS IN A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS. WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO RETURN HERE AND FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT SOMETHING'S A SIMPLE PROCESS IT'S- VERY RARELY ENDS UP BEING THE CASE SO I THINK- WE OBVIOUSLY WILL BE. REVISITING THAT AS WE- DISCUSS- THIS TRAILER BILL. ALL GOING GOING BACK TO THE COUPLE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE NOT SCHOOL RELATED MISLI- CAN YOU JUST. WALK US THROUGH- THE SMALL BUSINESS APPROPRIATION AND TALK ABOUT. OR CAN PROVIDE SOME GREATER COMMENTING AROUND- YOU TO WHETHER- WHAT THE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN THE DATA HAS BEEN. AROUND THE MONEY THAT HAS GONE OUT AROUND THE HOLIDAYS. AND WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO AUGMENT. THE PROGRAM AS IS WOULD YOU CAN GO WITH- THE GUIDELINES- OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND JUST ADD MORE MONEY TO IT. RIGHT AND AS YOU IN TERMS OF- THOSE GRANTS I THINK ARE ONLY. NOW BEING RELEASED AND SO I THINK THAT IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND TAKE YOUR THE FEEDBACK OF THOSE WHO HAVE APPLIED. INVERT IN REGARDS THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND- THE GUIDELINES SO I THINK THAT THERE'S ALWAYS A DESIRE TO THE INTERVIEW OF PROCESS TO DO BETTER- I WOULD HAVE TO TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF MY- COLLEAGUES FOR THE SPECIFICS. IN REGARDS TO THE DETAIL THE QUESTION. THANK YOU. FROM THE PERMANENT FINANCE- SO WE'RE IN. AN INITIAL- GRANT- WE'RE ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS THAT CLOSES AT THE END OF THE DAY ON THE THIRTEENTH SO AT THIS POINT TIME THERE ISN'T ANY DATA AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE HOW WE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS BUT WE- DON'T. EXPECT TO GET THAT DATA AND IN THE COMING WEEKS- WE EXPECT THE FIRST NOTICE OF APPROVAL TO BE AS SOON AS JANUARY FIFTEENTH AND WILL USE THAT DATA TO INFORM- THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ADDITIONAL. AUGMENTATION WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE. GOT I GOT I THINK I WE ARE AS THE FIRST MANY MY COLLEAGUES VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. MONEY GOING TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT. I THINK- IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE FEEDBACK I'VE BEEN GETTING FROM BUSINESSES LOOKING AT- WHICH BUSINESSES MAY HAVE HAD THE GREATEST INCOME LOSS- SO ESPECIALLY FROM DIFFERENT ARTS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. OPEN UP AT ALL- PERHAPS THERE'S A WAY TO HAVE GREATER TEARING OR MAYBE A BONUS FOR- COMPANIES OR ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE HAD- PERCENTAGE. OF INCOME LOSS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BLE TO OPEN UP. ALSO THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT WILL BE INCREASED- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS JUST TO TIDE PEOPLE OVER FOR A MONTH OR TWO. WHETHER WE WOULD LOOK AT. DOING SOMETHING. LARGER IN THEN I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WERE IN DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE GRANT PROPOSAL JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE GRANTS WERE GOING OUT ALL ACROSS THE STATE. IN THAT THERE WAS A PROPER EQUITY BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT REGIONS AROUND THE STATE I KNOW THE CDFI THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF. DISTRIBUTING THAT WAS VERY SENSITIVE TO IT WE JUST WANT TO SEE AS WE GET THE DATA WITH THE DATA ACTUALLY REFLECTS THERE ARE THERE ARE GOOD INTENTIONS. I'M JUST JUMPING INTO. THE CDC ARE FOR A SECOND-YOU KNOW MISS LEE ONE OF THE THAT YOU KNOW TO THE HIGHEST CASES OF. COLD WITH A VISITATIONS WITH COVETED- THAT THE STATE HAS SOME. DIRECT CONTROL OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY AUTHORITY WORK. AROUND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL AS OUR STATE PRISONS. SO- AND ON MY COLLEAGUES JONES SAWYER SORT OF TALK ABOUT THIS- BUT CAN YOU WALK THROUGH. THE PRECAUTIONS THAT ARE. BEING ADDRESSED TO LIMIT. ON THE AMOUNT OF COVERT FROM ENTERING INTO- THE DIFFERENT PRESENTS- AGAIN. MOST OF THE CULPRIT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ROUGHT INTO THE FACILITY EITHER BY TRANSFERS OR BY. EMPLOYEES SO IF YOU COULD SORT OF COMMENT ON WHAT PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY LIMIT THE- POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THOSE FACILITIES. I'M SURE I'LL START AND THEN I WILL- HEADED OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT JUST AGAIN I'M POINTING TO BE. A DIRECT RESPONSE COST ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET IS THE RECOGNITION THAT THAT OUT THE SPREAD IN PRISONS IS IT SIGNIFICANT AND WE HAVE PUT FORWARD PART OF IT OF MONEY- BUT IN TERMS OF THE DETAILS I'LL I. WILL HAND IT OVER TO ONE MY COLLEAGUES. HI THIS IS A COMPOUND AGAIN- ARMENIANS DONE QUITE A BIT OBVIOUSLY. THE SAUDIS ARE AT GREATEST RISK FOR COCONUT SPREAD I'M DAVE RESTRICTED IN MY MOVEMENTS- ACTIVATED JIM STATE ROOMS TEMPERATURE- TEND TO SAUDIS TO CREATE PHYSICAL DISTANCING- THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED INMATE AND STAFF TESTING PROCEDURES- THERE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND TESTS PER MONTH ON EMPLOYEES AND SEVENTY THOUSAND TESTS ON INMATES ONE PLACE- THEY'VE- WITH THERE'S A NUMBER OF POPULATION REDUCTION- MEASURES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. SINCE THE START OF A PANDEMIC- INCLUDING CLOSURE INTAKE FOR MOST THE TIME TO COUNTY JAILS AND IS CURRENTLY OVER IN EIGHT THOUSAND MATES INCOMING JAILS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN STATE PRISON SO ALL THOSE EFFORTS TAKEN TOGETHER- ARE SORT OF THERE WERE SPONSORED AND THERE'S EVEN. MORE THAN I WOULD DESCRIBE. IT IS ALSO- RESUME- REQUIRING ALL STAFF AND CONTRACTORS TO WORKERS. MASK INSTEAD OF JUST COOPER IN. IT STAFF AND CONTRACTORS ARE PROVIDED DOES ON A DAILY BASIS. THANK YOU IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEES WORK FOR QUARANTINE PROTOCOLS OR- TESTING PROTOCOLS ARE BEING ASKED TO BE EMPLOYEES. SO HIGH LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS THERE- I DON'T RECALL GIVEN THE RECENT OUTBREAK I BELIEVE. THEIR. TESTING PROCEDURES EVERYONE AGREES SEVEN DAYS I LOOK LET LET ME GET BACK TO YOU JUST TO BE SURE. AND IF AN EMPLOYEE TRAVELS OUT. OF KERRIER ARE THEY BEING ASKED TO QUARANTINE. AFTER THEY WERE TRYING TO. I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY ON THAT ON HOW TO GET BACK TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW THE SECRETARY HAD IN OUR LAST HEARING- EMAILED OUT- GUIDELINES- THE BIT AT LEAST AT RO LAST YEAR I DIDN'T HEAR THE GUIDELINES WERE BEING. FOLLOWED DO WE- SEE THAT THERE'S GREATER ADHERENCE TO THE GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN. AND I THOUGHT I THINK I WAS LIKE THE SECOND OR THIRD OR FOURTH TIME THOSE GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN EMAILED OUT. OF ARE WE- WITNESSING ANY GREATER ADHERENCE TO GUIDELINES. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT IT HEARINGS TO- MASKEY STAGE GREAT- AND THEN IN TERMS OF- THE- THE SPREAD HOW HOW IS THE CONTAINMENT GOING WITHIN THE FACILITIES. HOW ARE THE NUMBERS LOOKING IN THE FACILITIES WELL I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE UP. FROM WHERE THEY WERE IT'S SORT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC I THINK THEY GOT AS HIGH AS NINE THOUSAND FOR INMATES- IN LOOKING AT OUR WEBSITE TODAY I THINK I MEMBERS CLOSER TO SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED- BUT I THINK. THAT THERE ARE GOOD GIANT THERE AND REALIZE THERE'S STILL AN EMERGENCY STATE- GIVEN HOW HIGH THE NUMBERS ARE SO I'M JUST CONTINUING TO MONITOR AND DO THEIR BEST TO PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD. THANK YOU AND THIS IS A MATTER BEFORE THE STRONG SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- CAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S A STRIKE TEAM THAT THE PAYMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS. ON HOW HOW'S THAT STRIKE TEAM. DOING IN A THE TO. AGAIN SORT OF LIMIT THE SPREAD WITHIN THE OF NURSING FACILITIES A SEEMS UNFORTUNATELY LIKE ONCE YOU HAVE ONE INCIDENT SIMILAR TO PRISONS YOU JUST END UP HAVING A MASSIVE SPREAD WITHIN A PARTICULAR. FACILITY SO JUST ONE UNDERSTAND- HOW THE DPH THE STRIKE TEAM IS DOING AS WELL AS WHAT ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS WILL BE PUT IN PLACE TO SORT OF LIMIT THE SPREAD AND THE DIFFERENT- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE QUESTION TO FINANCE ALL YES CAN I. OKAY SORRY I WAS WONDERING IF ADAM TO RECEIVE IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. RIGHT YEP THIS IS THE ADAM TO RECEIVE FINANCES YES THE THAT PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN WORKING WITH CDC ARE ANOTHER OTHER DEPARTMENTS- YOU KNOW WHEN THESE ISSUES ARISE BUT- I DON'T HAVE ANY YOU KNOW DETAILS ABOUT SORT OF OUTCOMES AT THIS POINT YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT. THE TAR SORRY THIS IS ON TRANSIT OR SO WE THOUGHT IT SWITCHED TOPICS TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. SON OF YOU'RE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON. YEAH I GUESS IT'S A VERY SIMILAR ANSWER I MEAN AS MUCH LIKE THAT WITH CCR AND I AND OTHERS THAT YOU KNOW- LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON DETAILS AROUND. YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF SPECIFICS OKAY HASTA LAS CARPENTER TEAM TO. FALL ON. IT AND THEN JUST LASTLY I KNOW THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE TV I THINK IT JUST GOES TO UNDERSCORE THAT. IN ALL EIGHTY OF OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH PHONE CALLS. ON WE'VE JUST GOT- ANOTHER. MAY ORG I GUESS COMMUNICATION THAT WENT OUT ON TOP OF THE- THREE TO FOUR WEEKS IT WILL TAKE FOR THE NEW IDENTIFICATION SOFTWARE TO VERIFY. IDENTIFICATIONS JUST SEEMS- SORT OF MIND BLOWING GIVEN THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE JUST HAD THEIR IDENTITIES VERIFIED- I BELIEVE NOW THERE ARE- SOME. NEW ISSUES WITH SOFTWARE THAT WILL- THAT WE WERE JUST I THINK JUST HOLD. ON FOR LIKE A DAY A DAY AGO THAT ARE NOW FROM BEING. JUST JUST COMMUNICATED IS I MEAN. OUR OUR OUR FRUSTRATION IS THE- WE'RE TRYING TO WE ARE SORT OF EXTENSIONS OF THE EDT CALL CENTER WE WANT TO BE GIVING. OUR CONSTITUENTS AS MUCH REAL TIME INFORMATION AS WE CAN HOWEVER IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT IF HE DID HE'S NOT GIVING US OF THAT REAL TIME INFORMATION AND- IT IS- DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE GET INUNDATED. WITH PHONE CALLS WHEN SORT OF SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH EDT SO HOW HOW DO WE SORT OF RECTIFY THIS COMMUNICATION ISSUE. THE N. FROST WELL WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE. CONSTITUENT PHONE CALLS WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT D. D. SHOULD BE HANDLING THESE.

EMAIL JUST TO DRESSING THE ISSUE JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE. ANY INFORMATION. UP YES- MISTER CHAIR UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION AND THAT MANY MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FRUSTRATED AT THIS- I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE- ISSUE WITH THE IDENTIFICATION APPLICATION- BUT IN REGARDS TO- COMMUNICATION GENERALLY AGREE THAT. MORE NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND- IT'S NOT A AN EXCUSE BUT THERE ARE OTHERS- A LOT OF WORK GOING ON EASY AND IT AND I UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES. THINGS GET DROPPED- BUT OUT OF I COMMIT TO MAINTAIN THAT CONVERSATION- WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM OFTEN- AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT GETS OUT BUT I- I BELIEVE THAT.

TO- MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WALL I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN- SOME INITIAL FEEDBACK ESPECIALLY FROM EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC FROM YOU KNOW MARCH APRIL MAY AND HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING. TO CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEM. AT A TIME WHEN- ISSUES CONSTANTLY ARRIVE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WITH NEW. SOFTWARE THEY'RE ALWAYS GLITCHES AND THERE IS- SORT OF ISSUES BUT AGAIN- IT IS IT IS VERY CHALLENGING TO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO CONSTANTLY HAVE TO ADDRESS. THE LATEST C. D. D. ISSUE WHETHER IT'S GOING FROM THE BANK. DEBIT CARD- FREEZING AND AGAIN I HAVE A STANDING REQUEST FOR THREE WEEKS FROM THIS TO THE SECRETARY. ASKING FOR A MEETING BETWEEN BANK AMERICA AB DE D.

IS ON ALL THE WEEKLY CALLS COSTLY GIVING FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING US I'M SURE- ALMOST ALL THESE OTHER MEMBERS AND THEIR STAFFS ARE DOING THE SAME.

BETWEEN THE BETWEEN OUR ARMED LEGISLATURE AND THAT THE PART. SO ON THAT NOTE I'M NOT SEEING ANY OTHER. HANDS OR ANY OTHER COMMENTS. FROM INDIVIDUALS SO WE ARE NOW GOING TO GO TO.

WE HAVE A BIG BUDGETS BIG STATES MY NAME IS A MY NAME IS RICHARD I CAME HERE I'M GLAD I DID- ARM I'M SEEING SOMETHING THIS KIND OF COMMON WITH A LOT OF LEADERS- THERE. THINKING THEY HAVE TO MAKE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE CARE OF US THAT WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES. I'M SEEING PEOPLE RESPONDING OUT OF FEAR FEAR TOO MANY THINGS. FEAR OF TOO MANY THINGS.
