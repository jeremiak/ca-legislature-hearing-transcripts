THE TRANSITION INTO INTO THESE

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.474

IN IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW FLEET.

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.964

I BELIEVE WAS BUILT IN TWO.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.986
THOUSAND NINE- BUT I DON'T HAVE

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.588

BUT IT'S A CONTINUAL OF

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:48.093
REPLACEMENT A SCHEDUL THAT WE

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.795
DO. A CELEBRITY THAT I THINK

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.363
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE I TO

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.432
THE TO THE AUTHOR THAT MAYBE

RISING COSTS OF THAT MAY BE

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:13.652
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE MADE

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.853
DISCUSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.922
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OF A

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:22.394

COMING AGAINST US- NAVY SHIPS OR

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.147
GOING ALONG SIDE IT SHOULD SAY

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:48.120

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:04.536
BUT MY KEY QUESTION IS WHY

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:09.408
DOESN'T THIS BILL. HELP LONG

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:12.077
BEACH AND SAN DIEGO WHY NOT MAKE

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:17.616
IT. WAIT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:22.187
THAT'S MY QUESTION. PERFORATING

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.389
ANSWER WHOEVER WOULD LIKE MAKE A

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.658
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- SO

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.127
THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THE

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.063
PILOTS IN LA LONG BEACH-

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.065
GOVERNED UNDER A SEPARATE-

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:35.133
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHETHER

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.969
PRIMARILY GOVERNED BY FEDERAL-

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:40.172
PILOTAGE STATUTES AND LICENSING-

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.573
SO THE STATE PILOTAGE AND

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.608
SERVICES GOES A LITTLE BIT

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:46.278
DIFFERENT- AND WE ARE PRIMARILY

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.180
FOCUSED ON THE VERY SPECIFIC

00:20:48.246 --> 00:20:50.015
COST FOR SOME CISCO PILOTAGE

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:52.384
VESSELS IN THIS BILL. THE SAME

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.053
ISSUE IT DOES APPLY AND SO IN

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.887
CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.322
O'DONNELL HAS A BILL WITH

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.491
RESPECT TO- SOME OF THESE COSTS

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:01.026
WITH RESPECT TO OTHER VESSELS

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:02.828
IMPACTED BY THE CAR COMMERCIAL

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.429
HOVERCRAFT RULES BESIDES JUST

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.430
THESE VESSELS WERE TALKING

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:09.267
ABOUT- BUT TO VICE CHAIR FONG'S

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:10.435
QUESTION. WE WHAT HAPPENS WITH

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:13.171
THESE SURCHARGES IS THE VESSELS

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:15.507
TURN OVER ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.309
A NATURAL SCHEDULE FOR DOING

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:19.177
THEN- THEY DON'T ALL GET CLUMPED

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.646
INTO ONE PAYMENT WHAT WE'RE

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.581
LOOKING AT NOW IS INSTEAD OF

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.282
HAVING THOSE- NATURAL RETIREMENT

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.251
IS VESSELS OVER TIME SO THE

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:28.720
SURCHARGES ESSENTIALLY A RETIRED

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.524
THEMSELVES OVER TIME- ACTUALLY.

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.393
THEY'LL ALL COME DO IT ONCE. SO

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.294
WILL HAVE A CONCENTRATED PAYMENT

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:39.564
PERIOD SO INSTEAD OF HAVING-

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.566
LOWER FEES OVER TIME WHAT THIS

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:43.402
DOES IS IT ALLOWS US TO DEAL

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.436
WITH THE FACT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:45.904
WHOLE LOT OF CONSTRUCTION

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.541
OCCURRING AT SAME TIME. THANK

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:54.179
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.849
YOU CHAIR- AND- PRE PANDEMIC HAD

00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.852
THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN US BUT

00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:03.088
MY DISTRICT STAFF AND I KNEW A

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.523
BAR PILOTS WHERE BASEBALL IS

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:05.824
TOLD ME THAT IT UNTIL YOU

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.626
ACTUALLY GET ON THE VESSELS AND

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.494
SEE THE WORK THAT THE BAR

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:11.296
OPPOSED TO IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:12.764
DIFFICULT AND INCREDIBLY

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.666
IMPORTANT FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:15.667
AS OTHERS MENTIONED.

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:18.870
ADDITIONALLY AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:22:18.937 --> 00:22:21.106
THE BAR PILOTS IN THE BAY FIRST

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:22.641
OF ALL THE BAY ITSELF IS

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.676
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING UP WHEN I

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.411
LEARNED- BASED UPON THE

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.046
DIFFERENT APPS AND CHANNELS THAT

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:31.950
OF THE BAR PILOTS. ARE FAMILIAR

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.552
WITH- BUT ALSO. GOING TO THE

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:35.120
DELTA ALL THE WAY FAR AS THE

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.988
PORT STOCKTON. THIS IS HOW FAR

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.256
THESE BAR PILOTS ACTUALLY-

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:40.025
OPERATE THESE SHIPS AND SO IT'S

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:42.060
QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND AS YOU

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.029
CAN IMAGINE VERY NARAL CHANNELS

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.130
THAT WE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:47.165

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:49.768

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:54.940
BALK ADE SIMILAR TO CARB- AS

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:57.008
REALLY PLAYED. A PUT A HUGE

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:59.077
FOCUS ON EMISSIONS AROUND IN AND

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:01.113
AROUND THE PORTS. AND I THINK

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.414
GIVEN AGAIN THE DISTANCES THAT

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.750

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:05.417
THESE VESSELS AND JUST THE FACT

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:07.219

OPPORTUNITY AND I ABSOLUTELY

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.238
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT EXTRA COST

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.240
WOULD NOT BE MANAGEABLE UNDER

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:30.142

BAY ENTITIES THAT ARE TRIPS TO

VERY SHORT WHICH IS A LOT OF

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.378
WHAT CALIFORNIA AREAS LIKE OURS

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.313
ARE WE ALSO FOUND THAT WE HAVE

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.048
ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.618
SECOND THIRD AND FOURTH

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:28.986
VEHICLES. IN OUR HOUSEHOLD. WE

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:30.787
WILL WE ARE HOPING THAT WE CAN

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.589

WHERE THEY COULD GET SOMETHING

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.394
THAT SLOW SPEED THAT CAN HANDLE

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:38.962
ALL OF THEIR LOCAL TRIPS. SO

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.931
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT. ONE

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.132
OF THE THINGS WILL BE VEHICLES

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.001
WOULD DO IS THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.569
TO GO ON YOUR HEARING. THEY

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:48.272
WOULD FREE UP CONGESTION IN A

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.007
ROADWAY. DAY WOULD STATE BECAUSE

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.375
WE'RE SETTING UP A NETWORK OF

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.610
STREETS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:54.878
TRAVEL ON THE STREET. THEY WOULD

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:57.114
BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO A FULL

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:58.916
SPEED CARD THEY BE AFFORDABLE

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:01.051
AND PROBABLY ONE THE MOST

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:01.919
IMPORTANT THING TO STAY WOULD

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.095
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE HAVE

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.697
REBATES FOR BOTH THE VEHICLES WE

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.165

CHALLENGED OR SENIORS. AND THOSE

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:33.784
PEOPLE COULD USE THESE FOUR FOR

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.485
LOW THEIR LOCAL TRIPS. AND GIVE

00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:37.387
