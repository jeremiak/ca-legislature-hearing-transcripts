WE KNOW AS WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THIS RECESSION- OF EQUITY AND DISPARITIES HARBOURFRONT CENTRE AND THIS IS A HEARING TO CONSIDER WAYS TO ADDRESS RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSING. IT'S CRUCIAL AS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE DISPARITIES HAVE BEEN PART OF AN AND DURING LIKE A SEA OF SYSTEMIC RACISM AND DECADES OF EXCLUSIONARY POLICY DECISIONS AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY FROM OUR BLACK AND LET NEXT COMMUNITIES. HAVE TOO OFTEN BEEN DENIED TO. SAFE HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOTH IN THE RENTAL CONTEXT AND IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP CONTEXT. WHILE HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS IS A LEGAL ACCORDING TO STATE LAW DISPARITIES IN HOUSING BASED ON RACE OF CONTINUED. PROGRESS ON CLOSING EXISTING INEQUITIES HAS BEEN INCREMENTAL AT BEST. AND WE ALL KNOW FULL WELL THAT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSING DON'T OCCUR IN A VACUUM THEY ARE TIED TO THE WAY THAT RACISM DISCRIMINATION AND BIASES MANIFESTED ACROSS SOCIETY. IN THE LABOR MARKET IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN EVERY ASPECT OF CIVIL SOCIETY. AND THIS IS WHY IT'S SO TIMELY IMPORTANT FOR POLICY MAKERS TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. AS A PANDEMIC AS AT A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF DIVERSITY AND AS WE NEED TO MAKE RACIAL EQUITY A PRIORITY AS WE CONSIDER POLICIES TO SUPPORT FOR JUST RECOVERY. WE DON'T KNOW WE'VE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THAT'S OUR HOPE THIS HEARING WILL SERVE AS A CALL TO ACTION IF WE TRULY WANT TO SEE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD ELIMINATING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HOUSING. THE CONVERSATION CANNOT STOP HERE. AND WITH THAT BEFORE WE TURN OVER TO THE PANEL SAID LIKE TO FIRST. OF THANK- THE CHAIR OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE SOMEONE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS PARTNER ON HOUSING ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. AND ASK IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME BRIEF REMARKS BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING. GOOD AFTERNOON AND AYE AYE A FAKE- THE CHAIR OF HOUSING COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO ADD. HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR TAKING THE LEAD IN ORGANIZING. THIS VERY% VERY IMPORTANT HEARING. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS IN ADVANCE FOR THEIR INSIGHTS. I THINK WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE. A AN INFORMATIVE AND IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. I DO ECHO THE CHAIR STATEMENTS ABOUT THE URGENCY OF THE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST HOME OWNERSHIP RATES IN THE NATION. FALLING ALMOST 10% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE NUMBER THAT THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN WORSE FOR LATINA- LET NECKS AND BLACK RESIDENTS. AT FACT THE RATE OF BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP IS LOWER TODAY THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN RACIALLY BASED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION WAS ACTUALLY LEGAL. THIS IS A TRAVESTY. SO TODAY'S HEARING WILL TOUCH ON MANY OF THE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS THAT. THE BANKING COMMITTEE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO RIGHT NOW. HOW DO WE INTRODUCE MORE FAIRNESS TO CREDIT SCORES AND HOW THOSE SCORES ARE USED TO SECURE HOUSING. HOW DO WE KEEP FAMILIES FACING FORECLOSURE IN THEIR HOMES. AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT DISPARITIES. IN THE MORTGAGE PROCESS THAT CREATE DISADVANTAGES AND HIGHER RATES FOR BLACK AND LATIN X. BORROWERS. THESE ARE SOME VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. THAT WE MUST ANSWER. SO WE HAVE POLICY MAKERS MUST DO MORE. TO MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE. IT IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST PRIORITIES THIS YEAR AND AS CHAIR OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE I ALSO BELIEVE THE BANKING INDUSTRY. HAS A BIG ROLE TO PLAY IN BRINGING CALIFORNIA TO A MORE INCLUSIVE HOUSING FUTURE. WHETHER IT'S ON THE FRONT END FINANCING CRITICAL HOUSING PROJECTS OR- ON THE MORTGAGE LENDING SIGN. HELPING PEOPLE ACHIEVE THE DREAM OF ECONOMIC STABILITY THROUGH HOME OWNERSHIP. BANKERS AND LENDERS NEED TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. I AM HOPEFUL THAT THROUGH A MIX OF LEGISLATION AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION TODAY AND LEARNING MORE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WITHOUT FURTHER DO WE WILL PROCEED TO THE FIRST PANEL- WHICH WILL BE ON DIVERSIFYING HOME OWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY WILL PROCEED WITH TODAY'S WORLD ASK EACH PANELIST TO PRESENT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WILL HAVE A FEW MINUTES FOR Q. AND A WITH MEMBERS- AND- THEN WILL ALSO BE ASKING PANELISTS FOR POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS IN FINAL REMARKS SO. UNLESS ANY OF OUR MEMBERS WANNA MAKE INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS. I KNOW WELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AS WE START. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT SKIDDED TO JOIN THIS HEARING IT'S MY FIRST APPEARANCE NUMBER OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION. I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR CONVENING US ON I HAVE THIS CRITICAL TOPIC WE NOTE THAT DECADES OF DISCRIMINATORY NEUTRALIZE AND LENDING POLICIES HAVE LED US TO A- TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALITY WITH EXTREME RACIAL DISPARITIES IN. HOMEOWNERSHIP AND GENERATIONAL. THAT MUCH IS NOT IN DISPUTE SO THE CHALLENGE BEFORE US NOW AS CALIFORNIA STATE POLICYMAKERS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS. HOW DO WE START TO REVERSE THOSE DECADES OF DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES IS DECADES OF INJUSTICE AND THAT BEGAN TO LIFT UP. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE TOUGH CHALLENGES THEIR NOSE EASY ANSWERS- BUT WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO ACT NOW AND WE'VE GOT TO DIG IN AND LEAD INTO THIS THIS ISSUE SO REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO. HEARING FROM OUR OUR PANELISTS AND EXPERTS ON PRACTICAL STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TODAY TO START. MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU MISS PETER NORRIS AND LET ME ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIRMAN CHU AND ALSO GRAYSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ONE CONVENING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WE HEAR FROM THIS PANEL OF EXPERTS TO HELP GUIDE US ON POLICIES THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. IT IS- IT IS- IT IS UNREASONABLE TO FEEL AND TO THINK THAT ONE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS UNREACHABLE AND NOT UNOBTAINABLE ESPECIALLY IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY WHAT IS THE BECAUSE WHAT IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHY- THEY JUST DID IT THE DISK. SCHURMAN NATION- IS TAKING PLACE WHEN IT COMES DOWN AFTER AMERICA TINO'S- WHEN IT COMES DOWN HOME OWNERSHIP WHAT IS PEOPLE HAVE TO MASQUERADING PUT A FRIEND- TO MASQUERADE AS THEM IN ORDER JUST TO BE- CREATES UNFAIR ECKEL EQUITABLE- REASONABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO GET HOMEOWNERSHIP AND JUST TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. AND SO I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN LISTENING TO THOSE FROM THE PANEL TO HELP GUIDE THIS DISCUSSION- AND ALSO AROUND CREDIT SCORES- AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE- ARE IN THIS AREA AROUND CREDIT SCORES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AFTER A LOT OF TIMES THE CREDIT SCORES ARE USED TO KEEP- PEOPLE OF COLOR DOWN AND BOUND AND NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THE AMERICAN DREAM SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING. IT IS TIMELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE NOW LET'S TURN TO OUR PANEL. AGAIN ON DIVERSIFYING HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA. OUR FIRST WITNESS IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING AT UC BERKELEY. WOULD LIKE TO INVITE PROFESSOR CAROLINE A READ TO TESTIFY. IF WE CAN GO TO OUR MODERATOR YOU COULD ALLOW THE PROFESSOR TO SPEAK. THANK YOU AND CAN ALSO GET THE PERMISSION TO SHARE MY SCREEN HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY CAN. IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME OR IF YOU COULD SPEAK MORE CLOSELY TO YOUR MICROPHONE IT'S HARD TO HEAR YOU. TANK YOU JUST A SECOND HERE. IS THAT BETTER THAT IS YES. AS SAM AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MY SCREEN ARE YOU GOING TO SHARE IT FOR ME. WE CAN SEE YOU NOW. AND ACTUALLY GO. AND WE CAN SEE YOUR SCREEN FIVE TERRIFIC- THANK YOU SO MUCH I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CHIU AND GRAYSON FOR INVITING ME TO TALK TODAY IF YOU COULD SPEAK UP JUST AS LOUDLY AS YOU CAN- THAT WOULD BE VITAL. SURE THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND THEN PROVIDE SOME- SUGGESTED POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M THE FIRST. POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS INCREASINGLY OUT OF REACH FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THIS IS A SLIDE THAT SHOWS YOU THE CHANGE IN THE BOTTOM THIRD TIER OF HOUSE VALUES. WHICH ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED MORE ENTRY LEVEL HOMES. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO EVEN ENTRY LEVEL HOMES NOW ARE SELLING FOR OVER A MILLION DOLLARS- IN LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND THE ENTRY LEVEL HOME IS. TOPPING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND SO ONE CHALLENGE WE FACE IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE PRICE OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LACK OF- MODERATE- SUPPLIED MODERATE COST THE PLIGHT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. WE SEE THIS IN MANIFESTING IN LOWER AND LOWER ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP PARTICULARLY FOR MODERATE AND MEDICAL INCOME FAMILIES. THIS SLIDE SHOWS YOU THE CHANGE AND- HOME SALES TO BORROWERS AT DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS AT 80% A 100% AND A 120% OF A. M. I. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ALMOST EVERY LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SACRAMENTO AND FRESNO. WE SEEN A DECLINE IN OUR FAMILIES WHO ARE EARNING AROUND THE MEDIAN INCOME BEING ABLE TO ACCESS HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE DECLINES ARE EVEN PRONOUNCED AMONG THOSE WHO ARE AT A 120% A IN MY IN A LOT OF OUR COASTAL CITIES. I THINK A BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND GRAYSON REFER TO THIS BUT WE SEE THIS ALSO MANIFEST IN SEVERE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN WHO HAS ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE TODAY IN CALIFORNIA'S JUST AROUND THIRTY SIX PERCENT- THIRTY POINTS LOWER THAN THAT FOR NON HISPANIC WHITES BUT WE ALSO SEE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE HISPANIC LIVE NEXT POPULATION. I'M THE ASIAN A HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IS HIGHER BUT I WILL SAY THAT FOR SOME ASIAN SUB COMMUNITIES WE ALSO SEE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. UP WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ASSEMBLY MEN MEMBER GROUP GIPSON ASKED WHAT WITH THE ROOT CAUSES I WOULD ARGUE% THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF FALL ALONG THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF THE HOMEOWNERSHIP ACCESS AND BENEFITS CONTINUUM. I'M GOING EVERYWHERE FROM CREDIT SCORES AND WEALTH TO MORTGAGE ACCESS TO APPRAISALS TO SUSTAINABILITY. TO GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS HERE- IN CALIFORNIA THE NETWORK FOR NON HISPANIC WHITE HOUSEHOLDS IS THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS COMPARED TO ONLY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR. WE KNOW THAT BLACK BORROWERS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MEDIAN FIKE OF CREDIT SCORES ARE COMPARED TO NON HISPANIC WHITE BORROWERS A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE POINTS WHICH IS SUBSTANTIAL. THEY'RE ALSO MUCH LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A CREDIT SCORE ABOUT 21% OF BLACK POPULATION HAS NO CREDIT SCORE COMPARED TO ABOUT 12% OF NON HISPANIC WHITES. EXCLUSIONARY ZONING HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS LESS THAN 5% OF LOANS GO TO BLACK HOME BUYERS. WE KNOW THAT MORTGAGE ACCESS AND DENIAL RATES ARE HIGHER FOR BLACKS AND HISPANICS FOR BLACKS DENIAL RATES ARE TWICE THAT FOR NON HISPANIC WHITES- AT 16% AND FOR HISPANICS- THE DENIAL RATE IS PRICING OF MORTGAGES ON AVERAGE BLACK HOMEOWNERS ARE PAYING THIRTY THREE BASIS POINTS HIGHER IN THEIR MORTGAGES THAN NON HISPANIC WHITE HOMEOWNERS. AT THIS TRANSLATES INTO DIFFERENT TAX BENEFITS BOTH THE MORTGAGE INTEREST TAX DEDUCTION AND PROP THIRTEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT HIGHER INCOME NON HISPANIC WHITES AND THOSE WHO OWN THEIR HOMES LONGER. APPRAISALS I THINK THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF RETENTION RECENTLY- HOMES IN BLACK NIGHBORHOODS ARE UNDER VALUED BY AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR DUE TO HIGHER LABOR MARKET RISK AND LOWER SAVINGS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FALL OUT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE HOMES THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET INTO. WHAT ARE THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS JUST VERY BRIEFLY A COVERT NINETEEN IS HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON HOMEOWNERS OF COLOR. WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SEE THE SAME LEVELS OF FOR CLOSURE AS WE SAW AFTER THE LAST CRISIS IN PART DUE TO FORBEARANCE PROGRAMS AND IN PART BECAUSE HOUSING VALUES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GONE UP MEANING THAT HOMEOWNERS IN DISTRESS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR HOMES. I'M BUT THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RACIAL HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES AND SUSTAINABILITY AND SO ONE IS TO THINK ABOUT A RESCUE FUND TO SUPPORT HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES BUT WHO ARE FACING LONG TERM INCOME DISRUPTIONS DUE TO COPE AT NINETEEN. UP WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE AND- EXAMPLES OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND THEY SHOW THAT THEY BOTH HELP PEOPLE KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOME AND ALSO- IMPROVE SUBSEQUENT EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. OVER THE LONGER TERM WE NEED TO EXPAND PRODUCTION AND THE SUPPLY OF MODERATE AND MEDICAL MIDDLE INCOME A MARKET RATE HOUSING- THE SUPPLY ISSUE HERE IS CLEARLY RELATED TO HOMEOWNERSHIP GAPS. AND WE NEED A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING RACIAL AND IN PARTICULAR BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP GAPS. THERE I THINK WE COULD THINK ABOUT A BACKSTOP OR GUARANTEE FOR LOW COST MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS PERHAPS DELIVER THROUGH CDF EYES IN THE STATE. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT OUR LOW COST FINANCING PRODUCT TO SUPPORT TENANT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE IN A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND THEN I THINK WE NEED MUCH STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND AUDIT OF PRACTICES TRANSPARENCY IN BOTH CREDIT SCORING AN APPRAISAL ALGORITHMS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AREN'T PLAYING OUT IN- THOSE MECHANISMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WHAT'S NOW HERE FROM OUR SECOND SPEAKER WHO IS THE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN URBAN PLANNING AT UCLA. PROFESSOR JOSE LOYA. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE A. ACCESS TO SHARE MY SCREEN. WE COULD SEE YOU AND YOU CAN SEE SHARES GOING. OKAY GREAT. ALL THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. OCT. IT'S NOT LETTING ME SHARE MY SCREEN. IT'S OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT I GUESS IT'S NOT LETTING ME SO I'LL HAVE TO TALK TO MYSELF ONLY I HAD HAD A FEW SLIDES SO IT'S OKAY- SO I APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO SHARE MY SCREEN A GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME'S WILL SET LARA- TEN TODAY I'M ACTUALLY GONNA DISCUSS- A TAIL END OF WHAT CARE. OF CARE- CAROLINE ARE YEAH CAROLINE ARE GODLINESS- DISCUSSED EARLIER- AND I'M GONNA FOCUS MORE ON MORTGAGE ACCESS STILL A MAJOR CONVENTION OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AS ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR MINORITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO LOOKING AT A VERY SIMILAR DATA SAID THAT CAROLINE USED OUT FOR HER TABLES AND FIGURES- I'M GONNA DISCUSS THE TWO THOUSAND THE READ MORE RECENT TRENDS AS IT RELATES TO. OUR MORTGAGE ACCESS FOR MINORITY BORROWERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACT DATA- THAT- INCORPORATES ALL CALIFORNIA WE WERE STARTING TO SEE LARGE ETHNO RACIAL DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO MORTGAGE CREDIT ARE SIMILAR TO THE LEVEL THAT WE SAW ACTUALLY PRE. THE GREAT RECESSION FROM THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN- WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT LATIN ACCENT BLACK HOME SEEKERS- OBTAINABLE A HIGH COST AND- OBTAIN A HIGH COST LOAN ABOUT ASIAN WHITE BORROWERS THAT ONLY GET A HIGH COST PHONE AT ABOUT STARTING TO RESEMBLE THE TRENDS THAT WE STARTED TO SEE OR THE TRENDS THAT WE SAW PRE THE GREAT RECESSION OR DURING THE HOUSING. BUBBLE AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN A- TO THAT- WERE ALSO STAR TO SEE THIS ALARMING TREND FOR LOW INCOME BORROWERS. AS THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY- ALMOST. CHEST AND IT'S NOT 20% OFF 15% MORE LIKELY TO GET HIGH COST LOAN IN HIGH INCOME BORROWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVELS- WE SEE AN EVEN LARGER TREND AS BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS. ARE LATINO NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AGAIN MORE LIKELY TO ABSORB THESE HIGH COST LOANS SIMILAR SIMILAR TO THE TRANS PRE THE GREAT RECESSION. IN FACT WHEN WE LOOK AT PREDOMINATE MINORITY COMMUNITIES. ABOUT 20% OF ALL LOANS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE NOW HIGH COST LOANS. RELATIVE TO A COMPARED TO ABOUT 10% IN PREDOMINANTLY WHITE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- INSTEAD OF FINALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE SEE THE SAME TREND. AS IT RELATES TO ETHNO RACIAL DISPARITIES. IN HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN TERMS OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ACCESS TO GO TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE LARGEST VEHICLE FOR GENERATING THIS WEALTH IS TO THE MORTGAGE MARKET. AND SO WE HAVE TO START TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT WAYS ONE AS CARILLO AS AS- I KEEP MONEY SAFE CATALINA A CARELESS. DISCUSSED IS WE NEED TO START SLOWING DOWN THE APPRECIATION OF HOMES UP BECAUSE OF THE ETHNO RACIAL WEALTH GAP OF MINORITY BORROWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE YOU IT'S JUST A SIMPLY BECOMING LESS AND LESS AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE GROUPS AND SO FIGURING OUT WAYS TO SLOW DOWN- THIS TYPE OF APPRECIATION WOULD HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS BECAUSE- MINORITIES ARE UTILIZING OR OBTAINING HIGHER LEVELS OF HIGH COST LOANS. THAT ARE JUST MUCH MORE PROBLEMATIC OF FOR THE LONG TERM- PROSPECT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR MINORITY COMMUNITIES- AS WE SAW ON THE GREAT RECESSION IS HAD DESPERATE IMPACT SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S CAROLINE- DISCUSSED AS IT PERTAINS TO COLBY. WE MAY NOT SEE IT AS HIGH LEVELS OF FORECLOSURE BECAUSE OF THE POOR PARENTS ISSUES WE STILL CAN SEE VERY LARGE LONG TRM EFFECTS OF THESE HIGH COST LOANS BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING ABSORBED IT'S SUCH SEGREGATED. AND PER DOMINO ALREADY NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE FOR PANEL BEFORE Q. IN A- IS THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA POLICY. AT THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING. RESCALE TAURUS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHURCH TO ENSURE GRAYSON AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BANKING AND FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TO HIS HEARING I AM THE CALIFORNIA POLICY DIRECTOR THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING C. R. L. WHICH IS A POLICY AFFILIATE OF SELF HELP SELF HELP IS ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST NONPROFIT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN OVER FORTY YEARS HAS CREATED ASSET BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS RURAL COMMUNITIES WOMEN AND FAMILIES OF COLOR. SOMETIMES THE NINETEEN CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION BRANCHES SERVE JUST OVER SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IN THE STATE. I'M OWNERSHIP IS A KEY PILLAR OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THIS IS THE PRIMARY WAY THAT MOST MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BUILD WEALTH AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. I'M EQUITY ACCOUNTS WHICH IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WELL HOME EQUITY ACCOUNTS 439% OF WHITE HOUSEHOLD WEALTH IT REPRESENTS 53% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. FROM MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR HOME REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSETS AT A FAMILY MAY EVER OWNED. AND THE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES CONSTITUTES A LARGER SHARE OF PERSONAL WEALTH. WIDESPREAD ACCESS TO LOW COST FAIRLY STRUCTURED CREDIT IS A CRITICAL FOR BUILDING FAMILY WEALTH CLOSING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IN SUSTAINING THE HOUSING MARKET OVERALL. THIS IN TURN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR OVERALL ECONOMY. YET THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE MAINTAINED AND REFINANCE A HOME STILL HAS NOT REACHED SIGNIFICANTPORTIONS A LITTLE MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AND BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. TODAY'S HUESO HOMEOWNERSHIP DISPARITIES ARE THE RESULT OF A TROUBLED HISTORY OF RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE MORTGAGE ECOSYSTEM. IN FACT THE BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IS STILL AT LEVELS SIMILAR TO WHERE IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE FEDERAL. FAIR HOUSING ACT WAS FIRST PASSED. WE KNOW THAT. HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES ARE LOWERED NATIONAL. BUT STILL A GREAT AMOUNT OF WHITE AMERICANS. HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY THAN PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE DISPARITY IN HOME OWNERSHIP IS A MAIN DRIVER OF THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. THE MEDIAN WHITE FAMILY HAS TEN TIMES THE WEALTH OF THE MEDIAN BLACK FAMILY AT EIGHT TIMES THE WEALTH OF THE MEDIAN LATINO FAMILY. FAMILIES OF COLOR HAVE NOT BEEN AFFORDED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WEALTH THROUGH FEDERALLY SUPPORTED INVESTMENTS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND WE'RE DEVASTATED BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES LOST. ONE TRILLION DOLLARS IN WEALTH FROM UNNECESSARY FORECLOSURE. AND THIS IS JUST THE PAINFUL BACKDROP UP TO THE CLUB IN NINETEEN TEND TO MAKE WHICH IS WORSE THAN TE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AMERICAS HAS GROWN EVEN MORE STARK AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FROM HOME SEEING THEIR WEALTH GROW DUE TO STOCK MARKET SURGES. IN INCREASING HOME PROPERTY VALUES. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE LOW WAGE WORKERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BECOMING. ESSENTIAL WORKERS FACING HEIGHTENED COOLEY NINETEEN RISK AT WORK MANY FALLING ILL AND BRING THE VIRUS HOME TO THEIR LOVED ONES. FOR THEIR RISK THESE WORKERS ARE REPAID WITH LOW WAGES AND NEGLIGIBLE BENEFITS THEY'RE IN ADEQUATE TO COVER LIFE'S ESSENTIALS. LET ALONE TO ALLOW FOR ANY TYPE OF SAVINGS. IN ADDITION BE SPILLWAYS HAVE BASS MASSIVE REDUCTIONS IN WORKING HOURS WE JUST CUTS. UNEMPLOYMENT FOOD PANTRY LINES AND THREATS OF EVICTION. DESPITE FEDERAL EFFORTS LIKE THOSE THE CARES. MANY BARS. TO STRUGGLE WITH THEIR MORTGAGES WITH AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BORROWERS AT LEAST THREE MONTHS PAST DUE AND NOT IN FORBEARANCE. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE SAME AREAS HIT HARDEST BY THE PREVIOUS HOUSING CRISIS OREGON EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED DELINQUENCY RATES ESPECIALLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND CENTRAL VALLEY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND WHO HAS STRUGGLED TO KEEP UP WITH MORTGAGE PAYMENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THAT BLACK HOMEOWNERS HAVE BASED GREATER HARDSHIP IN DOING SO. OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE MUST LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE PAST AND TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT THE FURTHER WIDENING OF THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. AS HOMEOWNERSHIP DISPARITIES ARE ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE LONG TERM EQUITY. POLICYMAKERS MUST TAKE ACTION NOW TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ME WAS FOR CLOSURES THAT OCCUR THIS TIME AROUND. STRUGGLING FAMILIES NEED ASSISTANCE AND WE CAN HELP DELIVER IT. STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE CRUCIAL TO PREVENT THE PANDEMIC RECOVERED FROM LIGHTING THE GAP BETWEEN OUR TWO AMERICA'S. THANK YOU FOR INVITING STERILE TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED DISCUSSION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS ON THE OSCAR OF THE COMMITTEE IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS. YOU MISTER GIBSON I. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN HAVE A QUESTION FOR MISS TOURISM WHAT OF WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO LENDING. AND REASONABLE THE COURSE BECAUSE CREDIT IS STILL A VERY REAL ISSUE- AND UNDERSERVED AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO WHAT CAN WE DO IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCESS TO LENDING. SURE SO I THINK THAT- WE DO NEED MORE TARGETED AID SPECIFICALLY- TO OVERCOME DISCRIMINATION IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY TO START WITH- RESEARCH FROM FREDDIE MAC IN THE URBAN INSTITUTE DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF MARKETS READY. FARMERS OF COLOR TODAY BASED ON THE CURRENT CREDIT SCORES AND THEIR DEBT TO INCOME RATIOS BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DOWN PAYMENT SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST- BUT THEY COULD BE MORE TARGETED ESPECIALLY TO GET. THESE FUNDS INTO THE HANDS OF FIRST GENERATION HOME BUYERS SO PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE THE FIRST AND YOU KNOW IN THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN FARMERS GENERALLY DO NOT COME FROM FAMILIES. THAT HAVE LEGACIES OF BUILDING AND PASSING ON INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH AND SO TARGETING ASSISTANCE OF THIS POPULATION WOULD HELP TO ENSURE CONSUMERS WHO ARE MORTGAGE READY TODAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AS WELL. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW A PERSON BECOMES HOME BUYER READY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THIS IS RELATED TO THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE CREDIT SYSTEM. BEFORE THEY MIGHT EVEN BE CONSIDERING BUYING A HOUSE SO STARTING FROM FROM VERY YOUNG AGES ONCE SOMEONE STARTS INTERACT WITH CREDIT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET- ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP BUILD THEM UP FOR SUCCESS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. ACCESS ACCESS TO CREDIT OUR PRODUCTS LIKE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS THAT THESE ARE NOT SETTING UP CONSUMERS FOR FAILURE AND THEN A LARGER ECOSYSTEM OF CREDIT CANNOT BE PREDATORY AND SETTLING PEOPLE WITH YEARS OF DEBT THAT THEY CAN'T GET OUT OF. AND IT IS HARMING THEIR CREDIT AND THEN POSITION THEM NOT POSITIONING THEM IN A WAIT TO BE HOME BUYER READY SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED. TO CREDIT AND NOT JUST- IN THE MORTGAGE SPACE SPECIFICALLY AND THEN. SHE'S LIKE STUDENT AT WHICH IS A HUGE SORRY A HUGE BARRIER TO HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS- AND THIS REALLY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE RATHER THAN LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS ASK YOU KNOW THE STUDENT IS THAT FURTHER ENTRENCH. THE RACIAL WEALTH. AND PREPARE IN THIS OF POVERTY THAT IS RESULT. FROM THE- LACK OF. TO AND CAP. INTO FOUR CREDIT. SO WE NEED BOLD ACTION SUCH AS ACROSS THE BOARD STUDENT DEBT FORGIVENESS- IN ORDER TO REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT IS KEEPING. SO MANY PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO BECOME HOME. BUYER READY. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES US WAS A BANK TELLER MUCH REQUESTED BECAUSE I BELIEVE AND- GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IF WE TEAR DOWN SOME THE BEAR IS NOT THAT WE'RE NOT AND IN THE MIDST OF OPPORTUNITY WE CAN TEAR DOWN THE BARRIERS. TO CREATE THAT GENERATIONAL WEALTH I'M IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER QUESTIONS. THIS FEATURE. IN THIS IS I THINK POTENTIALLY QUESTION FOR ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND YOU SURFACED SOME POTENTIAL POLICY PROPOSALS I INCLUDING IN MORTGAGE GUARANTEE PROGRAMS TEN AND KIND OF YOU TO BUY TO RENT EXCITEMENT BY PROGRAMS AT MORTGAGE INCREASING MARKET ACCESS AT PROGRAMS- TO HELP SUPPORT ACCESS TO CREDIT CENTER ARE THERE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES- IN OTHER STATES ARE AND EVEN HAVE LOCAL CALIFORNIA. FIVE MUNICIPALITIES OF PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND ARE ACTUALLY WORKING IS THERE IS THERE MODEL THAT WE CAN POINT TO AND TRY TO EMULATE HER. HAPPY FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS TO A TO SPEAK UP IF YOU LIKE. MAYBE THIS IS CAROLINA MAYBE I'LL GO. FIRST AND THEN I'M FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE THAT- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH. THAT THE PANELISTS TAURUSES REMARKS THAT WE NEED TO SORT OF TACKLE THIS OF ALONG THE WHOLE ENTIRE SPECTRUM- WE DO HAVE GREAT MODELS AND IN FACT SELF HELP- AND CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING. DID INCREDIBLY INTERESTING DEMONSTRATION PROJECT CALLED THE COMMUNITY ADVANTAGE PROGRAM WHERE THEY SHOW THAT YOU COULD DELIVER WITH A VERY LOW SORT OF GUARANTEED GOVERNMENT BACKSTOP. YOU COULD DELIVER ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP TO LOWER INCOME AND- LOWER CREDIT SCORE BORROWERS AND THAT THEY COULD BUILD WEALTH AND THAT THEY COULD KEEP THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP SUSTAINABLE- I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S OTHER MODELS LIKE- STATE LEVEL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. OR GREATER OVERSIGHT OVER THE BANKING INDUSTRY GREATER INCENTIVES UP FOR LENDING INSTITUTIONS TO REACH INTO OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OTHER UNDERSERVED AREAS- EVENT BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO GOING TO TAKE. SOME INVESTMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO HELP OVERCOME. SOME OF THESE HISTORICAL DISADVANTAGES. AGREED AND THANK YOU FOR THAT I WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME MORE. INFORMATION ON IT HE SAID ATTEMPT THE DEMONSTRATOR PROJECT THROUGH THE HELP HELP CENTER IF THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. WOULD BE VERY NICE IT'S NOT. YEAH I. JUST LIKE A COULD I ADD THAT- THERE ARE IS THE WORK OF THE K. HOUSING FINANCE. AND THEY DO HAVE A PROGRAM THE MY HOME DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH WAS INSTITUTED UNDER THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TINA BOHMAN PETERSON WHO IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO FAIR HOUSING AND FOR LENDING- AND SO UNDER HER LEADERSHIP TELL HFA WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FIRST AID AGENCIES O ADOPT THE AFFIRMATIVELY AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING. FAIR HOUSING INITIATIVES- AND SO THIS IS A VERY GREAT- DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND IT HAS SERVED THOUSANDS OF FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR SO I WOULD SAY THAT- THE STATE SHOULD DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THAT WORK. CONTINUE THAT COMMITMENT TO FOR LEADING INTO FOUR HOUSING TO CONTINUE TO GIVE PEOPLE A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS THE OPPORTUNITY- TO BECOME HOMEOWNERS. THANK YOU FOR THOSE ANSWERS ARE LIKE TO GO TO OUR A FULL CHAIR MISTER BURSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR YOUR QUESTION ON MODELS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST TO WE COULD REPLICATE- BUILDING OFF OF THAT ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BANKS OR EVEN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO MAKE HOME OWNERSHIP MORE ACCESSIBLE AND THAT THAT COULD BE TO ANY OF THE PANELISTS. SO I WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT WORKS. AND PARTNERING WITH THEM TO SORT OF GET THESE CREDIT PRODUCTS- RESPONSIBLE LOANS TO COMMUNITIES I THINK IS A IS A VERY- STRONG MODEL THAT WE'RE USING IN THE SMALL BUSINESS SPACE WITH A CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND AND SO MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK OF A SIMILAR FUND. BUT DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY AT HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR FIRST TIME AND OTHER- AS LOW INCOME OR BORROWERS OF COLOR. I AM I WOULD SECOND THOSE CALL- COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE MISSION DRIVEN BUT INSTITUTIONS- AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR PROGRAMS AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MORTGAGE READY BARBERS AND THE ONLY. THING BLOCKING THEM FROM BECOMING HOMEOWNERS IS THAT DOWN PAYMENT- AND SO I THINK THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN SUPPORT THE WORK OF CDFI IS TO GET- RESPONSIBLY STRUCTURED LOAN AND CREDIT PRODUCTS INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE READY. I WOULD ALSO GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP IN TERMS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THERE WAS ONE OTHER ISSUE AREA AND RESEARCHERS AT. THAT BURKE WAS OFFERING PLAN BELONG INSTITUTE. FOUND THAT CITIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING OFTEN DISPLAY PATTERNS OF SOCIAL. ECONOMIC AND RACIAL EXCLUSION. SO HOW DOES THE STATE'S LACK OF DIVERSE HOUSING CONTRIBUTE- OR AT LEAST THE TYPES OF HOUSING CONTRIBUTE TO THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN HOMEOWNERSHIP- I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING. EVEN MORE DETAIL AS- COULD THE CONSTRUCTION OF FOUR PLEXUS COTTAGE TOWARDS TWN HOUSES. OF WHICH ARE MORE NATURALLY AFFORDABLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF CALIFORNIANS PROMOTE A MORE DIVERSE HOME OWNERSHIP PATTERN WHICH ADDRESSES GENERATIONAL WEALTH. SO ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA TO ALSO FOCUS ON THE SUPPLIES PIECE- AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE ALMOST NO LENDING TO BLACK FAMILIES WHATSOEVER. AND EXCLUSIONARY ZONING PRACTICES THAT NOT ONLY DICTATE ONLY SINGLE FAMILY ZONING BUT THAT ALSO DICTATE OF MINIMUM LOT SIZES OR- SORT OF SCHOOL DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AROUND SETBACKS ANOTHER ZONING REQUIREMENTS REALLY LIMITS WHAT KIND OF STOCK IS BUILT AND THE AFFORDABILITY OF THAT STOCK- AND SO I THINK- EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING. TO REDUCE EXCLUSIONARY ZONING PRACTICES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE PUZZLE I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. IMPLEMENT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OWNING REFORMS IN A WAY THAT'S NOT EXTRACTED SO THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME ANOTHER WAY OF- SORT OF SPECULATIVE CAPITAL COMING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT ZONING AND CAUSING. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS AROUND DISPLACEMENTS. YEAH IN ADDITION TO- CAROLINE DESCRIBED- IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE WE HAVE THESE THAT THE PLANNING REGULATIONS ARE ARE OFTEN DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO- TO CREATE AN ALMOST. EVEN FOR EQUAL PLAYING FIELD ACROSS DIFFERENT REGION THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE OFTEN SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY- A LOT OF THE- POOR QUALITY HOUSING IS MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP IN. MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND SO WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO NOT ONLY PRODUCE MORE HOUSING- BUT TO BE HONEST-BETTER QUALITY HOUSING. WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO EVEN THOUGH WE MAY WANT TO DEGRADE OUR INCREASED PRODUCTION. BY THE BY I'M SO NEEDS- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO AT TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT COMMUNITY SO THAT SO THAT STARTING COMMUNITIES DONNA SAID ESSENTIALLY OPT OUT OF THE- REQUIREMENTS. AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MYSELF. I KNOW WHO. RECENTLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION TO RACIAL BIAS IN THE HOME APPRAISAL PROCESS- FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLES OF. BLACK ON HOMES BEING APPRAISED AT LOWER VALUES COMPARED TO WHITE OWNED PROPERTIES- WANTED TO ASK IF ANY OF YOU HAVE PERSPECTIVES ON POLICIES THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER. TO ENSURE THAT APPRAISALS ARE FAIR AND FREE OF BIAS. SURE WHAT WE KNOW THAT- APPRAISAL BIAS IS ACTUALLY A VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR LENDING LAWS- BUT AS YOU MENTIONED THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES. THAT APPRAISAL DISCRIMINATION IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE- AND SO WE REALLY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE VALUATION OF HOMES TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- HOMES THAT ARE THAT ARE OWNED BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT'S CRITICAL TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE CHANGES IN THE APPRAISAL BUSINESS MODEL. INCLUDING THE INCREASED USE OF THE AUTOMATED VALUATION MODELS WITH AN EQUITY LENS- SO THERE SHOULD BE A ROBUST REVIEW OF FEDERAL PRISONS STANDARDS. INCLUDING ETHICS STANDARDS INCREASE TRAINING OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS FOR APPRAISERS AND EXPANDED INITIATIVES TO BRING MORE PRAISES OF COLOR INTO THE FIELD- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF SALES COMPARISONS IN NEIGHBORHOODS CARRIES A LEGACY OF REDLINING INTO THE PRESENT. AND ALLOW ALSO STARKLY UNDERVALUED APPRAISALS TO INFLUENCE CURRENT VALUES. OF THE APPRAISAL INDUSTRY SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXPLORE MORE MODELS- THAT ARE MORE EQUITABLE ALTERNATIVES. TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING USED. OTHER PERSPECTIVE. MAYBE OUT OF FOLLOW UP TO THAT QUESTION YOU REFERRED TO- WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS SORT OF AN INCREASING USE OF ALGORITHMS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ARE IN THE FIELD WHICH MANY WONDERED IF THEY ARE- SOMEHOW CONTRIBUTING TO RACIAL DISPARITIES AND OTHER ALSO QUESTIONS AROUND CONVENTIONAL CREDIT SCORES AND HOW THOSE NUMBERS ARE PUT TOGETHER WONDERING IF YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON. THE USE OF THESE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT- THEY THEY DON'T LEAD TO RACIAL DISPARITIES. SURE I'M SO TO THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE VIGILANT ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO UNJUSTIFIED OUTCOMES IN CREDIT DECISIONS ACROSS THE BOARD OF AND A LOT OF TIMES IT GOES WITHOUT DETECTION- WE FULLY BELIEVE THAT THE REGULATORY AGENCIES SHOUL ACTUALLY BE CAREFUL NOT TO PUT FORWARD. GUIDANCE THAT SUGGESTS SUPPORT FOR INNOVATIVE MODELS OF TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING THAT WITH A FAIR LENDING INQUIRY- A LOT OF TIMES THESE ALGORITHMIC MODELS ARE BLACK BOXES. THAT ARE ABLE TO FORM PREDICTIONS AND DECISIONS IN A WAY THAT- ARE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE REASONS FOR WHY THEY MADE THOSE DECISIONS AND SO CONSUMERS HAVE NO WAY. OF KNOWING WHAT DATA HAS BEEN FED INTO THE MODELS AND WHICH FACTORS THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE USING A DECISION MAKING AND INTO THEIR DETERMINATION. WHETHER THERE ARE PROTECTED CLASSES AND WHETHER THE ALGORITHM HAS DENIED CREDIT BASED ON A RHODIA'S OR BIASED DATA- WE KNOW THAT A. I. HAS BEEN AN ELDER THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN EXPOSED AS PROBLEMATIC IN AREAS. INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE- AND SO I THINK THAT RATHER THAN SHIELDING ALGORITHMS FROM EXAMINATION- WE REALLY NEED TO UP TO AUDIT THEM AND TO AUTUMN SO AUDIT THESE ALGORITHMIC SYSTEMS. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO NOT PERMIT THESE MODELS TO BY PASS FAIR LENDING SCRUTINY SO THAT WE CAN REALLY SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE- BASED ON ON NEWER TECHNOLOGY. THANK VERY MUCH AND OUR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE FEW QUESTION. THANK YOU THE TO BOTH CHAIRMAN'S FOR PULL THIS TO I SAID I BOTH CAN SO IT'S REALLY MY SWEETS HERE- WHAT MICHAEL OF ALL SET A- VERY CAN ABOUT THE EQUITY THAT FACE. OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULAR ON HOMEOWNERSHIP AND I SEE TO MY COMMUNITY VERY DIVERSE COMMUNITY. AND THE COMMUNITY OF COLOR ARE CONSISTENTLY I'M GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PROCURE AND BUY HOMES WHICH IS HOW WE BUILD WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY- SO IT'S AN ISSUE AYE AYE CARE TREMENDOUSLY ABOUT. I WAS CURIOUS IF ANY THE PANELISTS COULD ALSO SHARE GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENED WITH COVERT NINETEEN THE IMPACT ECONOMICALLY ON SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND CAN WE- GET A HOLD OF THIS THIS CRISIS HAS CREATED AND HOW FAR ARE WE BEHIND GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF. ACQUIRING MORE HOME HOMEOWNERSHIP PERSONALLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BALL FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. AND FINANCIALLY BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS. I THINK THE IMPACT ON HISPANIC ASIAN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NINETEEN IS GOING TO BE A LONG STANDING. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED FROM THE LAST RECESSION IS THAT. IF WE WAIT TO SEE THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE TOO LATE. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK BOLDLY NOW ABOUT HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. UP WE KNOW THAT- DELINQUENCIES AROUND MORTGAGES FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RIGHT NOW ARE ABOUT. 45% HIGHER THAN FOR NON HISPANIC WHITES. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN I'M UNEMPLOYED HOW LONG HAD THEY NOT HAD ACCESS TO INCOME. AND HOW MUCH DEBT ARE THEY RECRUITING. BECAUSE INEXPENSIVE MARKET LIKE CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE A CRUDE FOUR SIX EIGHT A YEAR OF ARREARS IN MORTGAGE DEBT. IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO OVERCOME THAT. AND IT'S GONNA LIVER LIMIT OTHER LIFE CHANCES AND SO. ON AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS. THINKING ABOUT A RESCUE FUNDS TO THAT FAMILIES DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO SELL THEIR HOMES UNDER INVOLUNTARY CIRCUMSTANCES- AND OR- MAKING SURE THAT THE- DEBT ISN'T. USED IN. ARE ARE TAKEN AT. YOUR- THERE ISN'T SORT OF UP. RESPONSE TO THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR RACIAL. YEAH GOING OFF CAROLINE'S POINT I THINK THAT ANOTHER ONE OF THE- SMALL ADVANTAGES COMPARED TO THE GREAT RECESSION IS THAT HOME VALUES CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND SO A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE- THAT- THAT ARE VERY PICKY LIKE INVARIANTS IS SENSITIVE AND PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE PROBABLY GONNA BE OOKING TOWARDS THE REFINANCE MARKET. AND SO I THINK GOING FORWARD WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT THE STATE. AND LOCAL- BANKING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN PROVIDE TO THOSE FAMILIES. THAT ARE NECESSARILY WHAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO IN THE PER IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE LARGE VOLUMES OF THESE FAMILIES IF THEY DO WINDING STAY IN THEIR HOMES TO KICK TO CATCH UP ESSENTIALLY BASED OFF OF THE FINANCIAL SITUATION THAN THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF THE COPING. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK TO THE REFINANCE MARKET TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND TO OBTAIN SOME OF THE EQUITY THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE SO I THINK LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT WAYS TO ALLOW THESE FAMILIES TO ACCESS SOME OF THAT EQUITIES IT IS AN ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THE GREAT RECESSION. THAT WE SAW. A TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. BUT THE- WHERE THOSE PREDATORY PRACTICES MIGHT EMERGE RIGHT BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY SAW IN THE SUBPRIME GROOM. THE FIRST RESPONSE WAS OR THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS REFINANCE PRODUCTS IN LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO. AT OVERSIGHT REGULATION THERE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNOUNCER ANY FINAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M GOING TO ASK THE PANELISTS IF YOU WANNA MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. VERTICALLY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR US ON THIS AND ONE THING I'LL ALSO ASK IS- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY EVERY PART OF THE STATE IS A BIT DIFFERENT- I ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THIS- COMMITTEE. REPRESENT HIGH COST REGIONS IN THE BAY AREA AND WONDERING. GENERALLY DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HOPE TO LEAVE WITH US AND- DO THESE STRATEGIES LOOK. DIFFERENT FOR HIGH COST REGIONS LIKE THE BAY AREA. AND HAPPY FOR ANYONE TO JUMP IN OR- WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT PANEL. OKAY YOUR FIRST HE FIRST SURE I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICERS ARE COMMUNICATING TO HOMEOWNERS TODAY ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND TO AVOID FORECLOSURE WE KNOW THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- IT AND OTHER ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR CONGRESS TO EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND THE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION- HAVE PROVIDED TO PRIVATELY HELD MORTGAGES AS WELL AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT PRIVATE LOANS SHOULD ADOPT A FORECLOSURE MORATORIUM AND FORBEARANCE POLICIES OFFERED BY DGSE OR FHA AS WELL AS TO MERIT THE FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS IN PROVIDING CLUES FOR BAND SOLUTIONS. THEY DO NOT INCREASE BORROWERS MONTHLY PAYMENTS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA CAN ENSURE THAT SERVICERS ARE COMMUNICATING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION TO FARMERS- WE THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THE FARMERS CONSIDERED HARD TO REACH LIKE THOSE AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT FARMERS ARE RECEIVING TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION BUT I WOULD SAY- IN ADDITION TO THIS POLICYMAKERS MUST ALSO REALLY SUPPORT THE WORK OF HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCIES WHICH ARE ON THE FRONT LINES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES THE FIRST CALL- WILL GO TO A HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY WHEN A WHEN A HOMEOWNERS IN DISTRESS WHAT DO SERVICERS ARE NOT HOUSING HOUSING AGENCIES- AND SO. THESE THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL PLAY AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE US DEPARTMENT TREASURIES HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE FUND THAT WAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE READY TO WORK WITH TREASURY AND ALL PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN INFECTED AND EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE- DELIVERY OF THE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE RESOURCES FROM THE STATE TO SUPPLEMENT THE FEDERAL HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY FUNDS WE. SHOULD ACT ON THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. I WOULD JUST ANSWER. THAT ONE. NAY TO BE OF THE- BUT ALSO MAY SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAN PASS AMONG DRIVEN INSTITUTIONS. TO PURCHASE PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING FLIPPED THAT ARE BEING SOLD THAT ARE IN FORECLOSURE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER WAVE OF SPECULATIVE CAPITAL HITTING. LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND FINALLY I THINK OF FOR ME I THINK ONE OF THE POINTS I KNOW THIS IS A FOCUS ON HOMEOWNERSHIP. ONE OF THE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS IS ALSO UP TO THINK ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY ON THE RENTAL SIDE AND TO CONSIDER THE TYPES OF- AMENITIES AND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE NOT PROVIDING. TO THE RENTAL SIDE THAT ARE ALSO EXACERBATING THE DIFFERENCES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES ACROSS THESE ETHNO RACIAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH ON BEHALF OF OUR TWO COMMITTEES REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE IN THE ONGOING CONVERSATION. NOW THIS IS SOMETHING OF A GREAT INTEREST I KNOW TO MANY OF US AND APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS. AND WITH THAT I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO- MY FULL CHAIR TO. MODERATE THE NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE ARE NOT GOING TO TURN TO OUR PANEL ON FIGHTING FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION AND DISPARATE OUTCOMES AND RENTAL HOUSING. SO OUR FIRST WITNESS IS PROFESSOR TIM THOMAS RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT UC BERKELEY. WELCOME PROFESSOR THOMAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE I HAVE A SHORT PRESENTATION THAT I COULD HOPEFULLY SHOW TO YOU. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S ANY ERRORS OR ANY ISSUES- MY NAME'S TIM THOMAS AND I AM THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY- ANDS I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CALIFORNIA RENTERS- BY AND LARGE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF HOUSING STABILITY IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THAT HOUSEHOLDS. CAN IMPROVE THEIR OUTCOMES WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC STATUS SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT. MOBILITY IN TERMS OF- ON THE X. AXIS HERE THIS GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT ECONOMIC STATUS FROM THE LEFT HAND SIDE LOW INCOME TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS HIGH INCOME. IN THE Y. AXIS SHOWS MOBILITY AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE- UNFORCED OR ABLE TO MOVE TO LOCATIONS WHEREVER THEY'D LIKE BASED ON THEIR INCOME THEY USUALLY MOVE TO. AREAS WITH BETTER JOBS- ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS AND ALSO IMPROVE THEIR NETWORKS MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS HAVE LESS MOBILITY AND ON THE FAR LEFT WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE FORCED MOBILITY THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF RENTERS. FALL IN LINE WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE RIGHT TWO THIRDS BUT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE LEFT- ORDER A FORCED MOBILE HOUSEHOLDS AND SO BE- OBJECTIVE OF- THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW. WHO IS INSIDE THIS GROUP THAT IS FORCED TO MOVE IN OTHER WORDS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE STABLE HOUSING AND A LOT OF TIMES THIS IS A LOT OF RENTERS THESE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE FACING INCREASING REPS AS WELL AS A FICTION. NOW IN TERMS OF EVICTION WE CAN KIND OF SEE THAT THERE'S SEVERAL FACTORS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN TO IT AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM THERE'S A TRIANGLE OF INCREASING RENT. IMPACTED WITH INADEQUATE WELFARE AND HOUSING BURDEN. WE'RE ON TOP OF IT HAVE- MARKET ECONOMIC. SEGREGATION NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE. THAT IS IMPACTING THE ABILITY OF HOUSEHOLDS TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOME. AND BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING. BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS IDEA OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW ON CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AND RENTING WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY AND WHICH SEPARATED DIFFERENT RACIAL GROUPS INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES AND THIS STARTS FROM THE POST ANTEBELLUM CIVIL WAR. AROUND WHAT MOST SCHOLARS CALLED THE BIRTH OF THE GHETTO FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY NINETEEN FORTY. FROM THE NINETEEN TENDS TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WAS THIS PERIOD OF THE GREAT MIGRATION OF BLACK HOUSEHOLDS MOVING FROM JIM CROW SOUTH TO THE NORTH AND TO THE WEST. BUT AS THEY ENTERED INTO THESE NEW CITIES THERE WAS A RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF HOUSING AS WELL AS EQUITY I WON'T BELABOR THIS TOO MUCH WE ALL HEARD ABOUT REDLINING AND KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT. THAT BATES- DENIED ACCESS TO FOLKS WHO LIVED IN THESE PLACES WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE PATTERNS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS EXISTS TODAY IN TERMS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE ON THE TOP THE REDLINING MAP. SOMEWHAT MIRRORS A LITTLE BIT OF THE RACIAL SEGREGATION DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE LA AREA. AROUND NINETEEN FORTY TWO- NINETEEN SEVENTY THERE WAS CONTINUED WHAT WAS CALLED COLLECTIVE ACTION BREAK RACISM WHICH INVOLVED A LOT OF- COVENANTS HOUSING COVENANTS THAT PREVENTED- BLACK INDIGENOUS- ASIAN LATIN ACTS HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO CERTAIN SPACES DENYING THEM ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES. WHAT THIS ULTIMATELY DID- IT LED TO ANOTHER PERIOD OF DECENTRALIZE RACISM WHERE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT TRIED TO EQUATE MORE TRIED IMPROVE THE CIRCUMSTANCES. DISMANTLING WITH LEGAL SEGREGATION AND DISCRIMINATION. BUT THE LASTING EFFECTS OF REDLINING BLOCKBUSTING DISCRIMINATION LED TO AN INCREASE IN CONCENTRATED POVERTY. AND ALSO- CAN MIGRATION OF MIDDLE CLASS- BLACK HOUSEHOLDS INTO THE SUBURBS WHITE FLIGHT AVOIDING. THOSE NEW NEIGHBORS THAT THEY WERE SEEING. NOW WHAT THIS DID AS ADULTS OF IMPACTED THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GROWTH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS OVER THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS AS YOU CAN SEE FROM 1-963-220-0016 ON THIS GRAPH. THE WEALTH GAP GREATLY INCREASE THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE DENIAL OF ACCESS TO OWNING A HOME. AND FORCING HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR TO PARTICULARLY- BLACK AND WHITE NECKS AND HISPANIC HOUSEHOLDS TO RENT AT AVERAGES- WELL BELOW WHAT WHITES- HOUSEHOLDS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A HUGE GAP IN TERMS OF WHO RENTS AND WHO OWNS WHITE- HOUSEHOLDS ABOUT 63% OF THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OMERS HOUSEHOLDS ARE AT 59% OWNERSHIP TO FIFTY SIX RENTING. BLACK HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR ONLY SORRY 35% OWN 65% RENTS. BOB THIS LEADS TO AN ISSUE WHERE AS NEIGHBORHOODS ARE CHANGING IT'S IMPACTING THE MOBILITY AND STABILITY OF HOUSEHOLDS PARTICULARLY BLACK HOUSEHOLDS IN LENEXA HOUSEHOLDS. WHERE THE- POST NINETEEN NINETY PECAN CRIME CONCENTRATED POVERTY BECAUSE OF SEGREGATION. LED TO A LOT OF MARKET DIVESTMENT HOWEVER THE BACK TO THE CITY MOVEMENT OR GENTRIFICATION AS WE WELL KNOW IT. LED TO A LOT OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS BEING UP TO TEN LOANS AND PREVIOUSLY SEGREGATED URBAN SPACES. WHAT IS LED TO IS. THOSE SAME REDLINING MAPS WE SEE 87% IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE 87% OF REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS GENTRIFIED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A QUITE A BIT OF VARIATION IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF WHO CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD HOME OR NOT THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE- TO A ON A ONE BEDROOM- COST IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND RENTERS IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS THE- RENTS. THAT IS- FOR THESE FOR MARKET RENT AREAS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE TO EARN. TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD OR IN OTHER WORDS AVOID RENT BIRD. NOW ACROSS ALL THESE COUNTIES WE CAN SEE THAT WHITE HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR WELL ABOVE. THAT RENT BURDENED THRESHOLD. BUT PARTICULARLY AROUND AREAS ON THE FAR RIGHT HAND SIDE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATTEO- SANTA CLARA THOSE ARE VERY HIGH INCOMES. WE LOOK AT ASIAN HOUSEHOLDS THEY WERE ABLE TO FARE PRETTY WELL AND THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- INCOMES ABOVE THE RENT BURDEN. THRESHOLD WHAT WE LOOK AT LIVE NEXT HOUSEHOLDS- IN PARTICULAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT THEIR MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OVER IN OTHER WORDS HALF OF THE POPULATION. IS FALLING AWAY BELOW- THE RENT BURDEN AREA UNABLE TO AFFORD SOMETHING SPACES IN A PARTICULAR BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE FALLING WELL BELOW. THE AREA OF RENT BURDEN THAT- PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. WORK BE ABLE TO STAY IN PLACE- THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN A MASSIVE DECLINE IN MOST URBAN. WHICH IS FORCED TO DISPLACEMENT. THROUGH RISING HOUSING COSTS AND EVICTION INTO THE SUBURBS UNFORTUNATELY POVERTY AND ALSO UNEMPLOYMENT. AND LOWER EDUCATION HAS BEEN INCREASING IN THE SUBURBS AS WELL AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DECLINE. NOW IN TERMS OF EVICTIONS CURRENTLY IN THE PANDEMIC WE'RE STILL SEEING A VERY HUGE RATE OF A FICTIONAL MONTHS BLACK HOUSEHOLD TO PROTECT LOOK PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE LOWER LOCAL MORATORIUMS ARE PROTECTIONS. BY LARGE BLACK HOUSEHOLDS ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO FACE EVICTION DURING THE PANDEMIC. BLACK WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ARE FACING UP TO FIVE TO SEVEN TIMES MORE THAN WHITE MEN AND WOMEN IN TERMS OF EVICTION FORCING THEM INTO DISPLACEMENT. NOW QUICKLY I'LL END WITH THIS POLICY RECOMMENDATION OF WHAT WE GET THE URBAN DISPLACEMENT PROJECT CALLED THE THREE PIECE TARA PROTECTIONS WHICH INVOLVED JUST BECAUSE LEGAL REPRESENTATION EVICTIONS. ALSO RENTAL SINCE ASSISTANCE WE ALSO- PROMOTE PROTECTING EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH INCLUDES INCLUSIONARY ZONING RENT CONTROL IDENTIFYING HOUSING VULNERABILITY INSENSITIVE COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND REMOVING SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WITHOUT ALL THE- SETTLEMENT TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT INSIGHTFUL PRESENTATION WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM MERIAL BLOCK STAFF ATTORNEY NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT WELCOME THE FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I JUST SHARE MY SCREEN. THAT'S. ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE MY SCREEN. YES OKAY WONDERFUL SO BE THINKING ON NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE ORDINANCES TODAY- ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A NUISANCE IN CRIME FOR YOU PROPERTY ORDINANCES ARE BEING USED TO EXCLUDE AN EFFECT BLACK BUT NEXT AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM RENTAL HOUSING. NATIONALLY THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND MUNICIPALITIES WHEN YOU SINCE AND CRIME FREE ORDINANCES AND IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE ORDINANCES AND PROGRAMS. WHAT A NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE. THEY ARE- LOCAL LAWS AND POLICIES THAT PENALIZE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS FOR CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AT A GIVEN PROPERTY. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS LIST OF ACTIVITIES THEY'RE OFTEN VERY BROAD. J. SUBJECTIVE AND CAN EVEN INCLUDE EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES. THEY OFTEN ALSO INCLUDE VIRTUALLY ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY INCLUDING MINOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSES AND THE PENALTIES CAN BE EXTREMELY STRINGENT THEY INCLUDE EVICTION IMPRISONMENT DAILY FINES- AND OTHER PENALTIES. TYPICAL FEATURES A NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE- ORDINANCES IN PROGRAMS AGAIN INCLUDE BROADBAND OR SUBJECTIVE DEFINITIONS OF NUISANCE AND CRIMINAL ACTIVITY- REQUIREMENTS THAT LANDLORDS ABATE THE NUISANCE ACTIVITY INCLUDING THREE FACTION. REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SCREENING FOR POTENTIAL TENANTS- REQUIREMENTS ATTENDANCE AND VERY ONEROUS COUNTRY LEASE AGENDA AND VIRTUALLY NO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR TENANTS IN THIS PROCESS. THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES A NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE FOR- ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA ASIDE FROM THESE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE ORDINANCES AND PROGRAMS THESE INCLUDE THE STATE- UNLAWFUL DETAINER PILOT PROGRAM. THIS IS A CITY ATTORNEY INITIATED NEW SENSE OF ACTION PROGRAM- ANTICIPATING. CITIES INCLUDE LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH OAKLAND AND SACRAMENTO- AND THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE CITY ATTORNEYS GENERALLY DON'T HAVE STANDING TO BRING OF ACTION CASES BUT THIS- PROGRAM- EXPANDS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE TYPES OF NUISANCE EVICTIONS. IN ADDITION FOR CALIFORNIA DETAINER STATUTE SPECIFICALLY CCP ELEVEN SIXTY ONE FOR WHICH IS A NEW SIM GROUND EVICTION. ALSO PROVIDE SIMILAR SIMILARLY BROAD GROUND- BY WHICH TENANTS CAN BE A- BASED ON A VERY POORLY DEFINED- DEFINITION OF NEWS. AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE TENANTS CAN BE EVICTED WITH ONLY THREE DAYS NOTICE AND HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMEDY THE ALLOCATION. UNSURPRISINGLY THESE NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE POLICIES HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON BY PART TIME. THEY OFF APPROVED IN RESPONSE TO QUOTE UNQUOTE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE OR AN INCREASE IN BY PRODUCT RESIDENTS MOVING INTO AN AREA- THE L. A. TIMES COMPLETED A ANALYSIS- AND PUBLISH THIS IN AN ARTICLE LATE LAST YEAR. AND THEY FOUND THAT 85% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WITH THE LARGEST INCREASES IN BLACK POPULATION SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE APPROVED CRIME FREE HOUSING POLICIES. THAT ENCOURAGE ADDICTION- AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE- THIS IS THE CITY OF HYSTERIA WHICH HAS- FAST A NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE PROPERTY ORDINANCE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- AND STATEMENTS WERE MADE BY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND OTHERS IN THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITY WHAT AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS PASSED- THAT- INDICATED A RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY MOTIVATION FOR PASSING THE LOT IT WAS PASSED IN RESPONSE TO A QUOTE UNQUOTE DEMOGRAPHICALLY PROBLEM AND IT THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY ENFORCED AGAINST BLACK AND LYFT NEXT TENANTS. AND AS A RESULT ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SUED THE CITY OF THIS AREA AS WELL AS A SAMBAR DINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEIR FREE HOUSING- AGAINST BLACK AND MONEX RENTERS AND THIS CASE IS STILL ONGOING- THE CALIFORNIA UNLAWFUL DETAINER PILOT PROGRAM HAS. ALSO SHOWN TO BE- DISPROPORTIONATELY ENFORCED AGAINST- BLACK AND NOT NEXT AND OTHER TENANTS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND LA TIMES ANALYSIS- LOOKING AT RECORDS FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO THAT NEARLY 80% OF THE TENANTS TARGETED PROTECTION UNDER THIS PROGRAM WHERE BLACK LOT NEXT ANOTHER TENANTS OF COLOR. I NEED- BUT TENANTS BASED EVICTION CASE OF EXACT TWICE THEY'RE SURE THE CITY'S OUR POP- CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN SOME IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS IN TRYING TO MITIGATE THAT TIME DOING. IMPACTS OF NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE ORDINANCES PROGRAMS- RECENTLY- THERE IS AT THE HEART REGULATION THAT WAS PASSED OUT- PENALTIES AGAINST AND TENANTS ON BROAD DEFINITIONS OF NUISANCE ACTIVITIES- SO THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP AND IN ADDITION- CALIFORNIA AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTEEN. WHICH WAS CHAMPIONED BY SOME REMEMBER TO THE RIGHT TO SAFE HOME ACT ALSO PROTECTED SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS OF CRIME AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS FROM- BEING AFFECTED FOR CALLING THE POLICE. OR OTHER EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER MORE- PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM I'M SURE SOME POTENTIAL POLICY SOLUTIONS TERMINATING THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PILOT PROGRAM OF COURSE THIS IS SLATED TO SUNSET TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND IT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ADDED AT THAT POINT. IF NOT BEFORE- ELIMINATES OR NARROW CCP ELEVEN SIXTY ONE TOWARD THE NUISANCE FOR EVICTION TO MORE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND ELIMINATE- BROAD BASED- ADDICTION GROUNDS AGAINST TENANTS. AND CALIFORNIA'S A NUISANCE IN CRIME FREE HOUSE ORDINANCE AND PRO. AND ANY POTENTIAL SO THAT- OUR IDENTIFIED BY DIRECTLY. TENANTS YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND NOW I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO OUR FINAL PANELIST BEFORE WE GO TO Q. AND A AND THAT'S NEVER MEET GROW ALL LITIGATION COUNSEL DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WELCOME. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME TODAY. SO I WANT TO TALK A BIT ABOUT WHY THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES MATTER AND HOW THEY MANIFEST THROUGHOUT THE LIFECYCLE OF RENTAL HOUSING. SO FIRST THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF STUDIES THAT CONFIRM WHAT I THINK WE ALL KNOW. INTRINSICALLY WHICH IS THAT WHERE WE LIVE. MATTERS FOR ALMOST EVERY PART OF OUR LIFE. WHERE WE LIVE HAS CONCRETE OUTCOMES EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ON OUR MORTALITY RATES ARE MENTAL HEALTH OUR ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH OUR ABILITY TO PASS THAT WEALTH LONG GENERATIONS. AND SO. IF YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY HAS OPEN SPACES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES AND CONVERSELY YOU'LL HAVE MORE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT CITIES THAT I'VE WORKED IN ON SYSTEMIC ADVOCACY ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WAS WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN AREA OF OPPORTUNITY IT'S A CITY THAT HAD BEEN. HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY EXCLUSIONARY- IS A BIT WEALTHIER HAS GOOD SCHOOLS. HAS HAS GOOD ACTORS TO JOBS ANOTHER COMMUNITY ONE THAT IS CONSIDERED A RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY CAUGHT CONCENTRATED AREAS OF POVERTY. SO THE FOR COMMUNITY EVEN CALLED AREA OF OCT IS ONE WAY I WAS TO AND WORK ON PREVENTING THE MASTERS. OF RESIDENTS WHO HAD LIVED LONG TERM IN MOTELS IN THE CITY. FOR DECADES AS WE FOUND OUT THE CITY HAD STIFLED THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THERE'S SOME PRETTY DISCRIMINATORY MEANS- AND SO THE RESIDENTS WHO WERE LOWER INCOME IN IN THAT CITY MANY OF WHOM ARE LATINO WERE LIVING LONG TERM BRING THIS. AS I GOT TO KNOW A NUMBER OF THESE RESIDENTS I BEGAN TO FIND PATTERNS LIVING IN A MOTEL IS NOT CHEAP. IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE. IT IS OFTEN NOT ACCESSIBLE. BUT THE REASON THAT MANY WERE LIVING THERE IS BECAUSE THE SAME. FORECLOSURE CRISIS THE SAME SUBPRIME LENDING THAT AFFECTS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY HAD DESTROYED SO MANY OF THEIR CREDIT HISTORIES. TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LIVE IN MOTELS BECAUSE NO TRADITIONAL APARTMENT COMPLEX WOULD ACCEPT WOULD ACCEPT THEM AS RENTERS. OTHERS HAVE CRIMINAL HISTORY. BECAUSE OF THE SAME MASS INCARCERATION THAT HAS DEVASTATED BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL AREAS TO SCREENING TENDENCIES BASED ON CRIMINAL HISTORY ALSO LEFT THEM WITH NO OTHER CHOICE. ONE MOTHER THAT I TALKED TO WHEN I ASKED HER WHY DID SHE LIVE IN THE CITY INSTEAD OF MOVING. SHE SAID TO ME WELL MY SON HAS AUTISM. THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT I CAN GET A GOOD INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLAN FOR. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY STUCK WITH ME. WE COULD WE HAVE CREATED THESE BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'VE CREATED BARRIERS ALONG TENANTS YOU SCREENING. WE'VE HELLO TAX CONSIDER WHO ARE WE TRYING TO HOW. AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES. EXIST FOR FOLKS THAT WERE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO A REALLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION. WHERE THEY DO SO POTENTIAL EVICTION. AND ENTERED AND UP INTO BEING X. IN THE- BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO SOME SOLUTION. BECAUSE THESE BARRIERS MANIFEST ALONG. THE PLANNING AND PRODUCTION SIDE OF RENTAL HOUSING DID MANIFESTED ACCESS. EIGHT LEAVE YOUR A SITUATION WHERE. LANDLORDS CAN HARASS YOU WITH EACH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH- ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS BOTH THE PROTECT TENANTS AND THAT PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AND THEN I THINK YOU END UP TO THE PLACE THE PROFESSOR THOMAS DISCUSSED- ABOUT THESE SORT OF MASS DISPLACEMENT OFFENSE AND RESEGREGATION JUSTICE TO DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS. THANK CAN YOU THAT THE- I'M WORK IN. AS I SAID IS OF RACIALLY ETHNIC CONS POVERTY. ALL MY INTO LACK READ. WANTED THE COMMUNITY ARE I WORK WITH AN L. WOMAN DOES THE- WHO LIVES WITH MANY GENERATIONS OF FAMILY. WHICH IT AT HOME THAT OVER. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY LIKE TO HELP IMPACT ESPECIALLY TO THE SPEND DOWN WE'RE OVERCROWDED MAKES IT AND TO COURT PARTICULARLY FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. BUT THERE'S A COMMITTEE THAT A BRIEF TO ENGAGE WITH MEMBERS WHO ARE AT FOR HELP THAT'S OF TO THEM. IT'S A- TO THE AND THAT'S HEALTH- THAT. THE EFFECT OF TALK- THE TWO SOIL AND AIR THE THIRD. TO YOU. AND OF THE COMMUNITY HAS THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY LEAD HAVE LOOKED. LURING ITS PLANNING FOR THE RE AND HIGHER HOW. AND OF PLAY FOR NEEDS OF THOSE WHO ARE DEEPLY THERE. AND INTO OF THE PA THAT SORT OF THROUGH THE I THINK ONE THING THAT YOU SEE. IS THAT IN BOTH COMMUNITIES. THE PEOPLE THE BY PRODUCT PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM DECIDING FOR THEMSELVES WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN ACCESS CONTINUE TO BE EXCLUDED SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT pWE'RE ASSESSING THE RACIAL IMPACT OF EVERY. HOUSING POLICY THAT WERE MAKING MUCH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE SEATTLE AND SOME OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE WHERE RACIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED. I'M NOT ALSO WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE FOR RENTAL HOUSING- THE PRODUCTION ACCESS ANY POINT THAT WE'RE CENTERING DECISION MAKING ON THE ACTUAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN- HARMED BY THAT. DECISION MAKING. SO THAT WILL LEAD TO A NON OF. I HAVE THAT WE- ALTERNATE TO. USING REPORT FOR SCREENING WE NEED STRONGER TENANT HARASSMENT POLICIES WE NEED TO FULLY FUND OUR DEPARTMENT FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSINGS AND FORSTMANN ACTIVITIES WE NEED TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS. BUT I THINK AT THE HEART OF IT IS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER NOT JUST THAT WE'RE HOUSING PEOPLE. BUT WHO ARE WE HOUSING BECAUSE NOT EVERY TYPE OF HOUSING IS GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY PERSON AND EVERY FAMILY AND THAT THAT WILL BE DESPERATE BASED ON THE HARMS OF THIS RED LINING AND GOVERNMENT FEDERAL LOCAL- GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT THE HARMS FROM A REAL ESTATE. AGENCIES IN THE WHOLE PERSON WHITE. MOVE THROUGH CONTRA OR EXCLUDE. IS K. FROM OPERA TO PROTECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENT AND I DO TO OPEN IT TO THE COME MEMBERS. FOR QUESTIONS HOWEVER RIGHT BEFORE WE GO TO I- I WANT TO. BRING SOMETHING UP LET ME GROW ALL YOU YOU MENTIONED CREDIT. AND- WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF EVALUATING A PERSON OTHER THAN JUST CREDIT HOWEVER IF- AND CREDIT SCORES YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW ARE BEING USED AND IF THEY REMAIN THE MAIN MECHANISM TO DETERMINE SOMEONE'S ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY HOUSING. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO. TO HELP PEOPLE BUILD THEIR CREDIT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT FOR MANY OF THE CLIENTS THAT I WORK WITH THERE'S REALLY VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD CRACK. SO SOME OF THE REASONS CAN INCLUDE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED WHETHER JAILS PRISONS ARE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS THEIR RECENT IMMIGRANTS- OR AS I MENTIONED THAT THE YOU KNOW THIRD THEY THEY BEEN THE VICTIMS OF SUB. LENDING AND SO I DID LISTEN TO SOME OF THE EARLY PANEL TERMS OF BUILDING FINANCE ASSETS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO FOR NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE WORK WITH. IS ADVOCATES STRENUOUSLY LOOK AT BANK STATEMENTS LOOK AT RENTAL HISTORY MANY PEOPLE PAY THE RENT BEFORE THEY'LL PAY ANYTHING ELSE. LOOK AT THESE THINGS ARE OLD FEDERAL TORNADOES BECAUSE IF WE DO CONTINUE TO RELY ON CREDIT. WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE EXCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE I THINK IN PERPETUITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD CREDIT. I APPRECIATE THAT WELL WONDER THE THING BEFORE OF AGAIN WE GO WE GO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. AND THIS IS FOR ALL PANELIST AYE I DO BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY HAS TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY- REPORT CAME OUT THAT STATED THE STATE LACKS A SOUND WELL COORDINATED STRATEGY TO MOST AFFECTED AFFECTIVELY USE ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I'M CONCERNED THAT OUR EFFORTS TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND HOMEOWNERSHIP MAY SUFFER FROM THE SAME DFICIENCIES SO. HOW HAVE THE STATE'S PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP INCORPORATED RACIAL EQUITY INTO THEIR PLANNING A PROGRAM EXECUTION AND HOW SUCCESSFUL HAVE THEY BEEN I GUESS FURTHER I CAN SAY. IS THE SUFFICIENT COORDINATION AMONG THE STATES SEVERAL HOUSING FINANCE- FINANCING ENTITIES TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THIS. POLICY AND POLICY CHANGE. M. ANY ANY OF THE PANELISTS CAN RESPOND. BUT NOT ALL AT ONCE. I THINK THAT- I'LL BE THE BRAVE ONE AND SAY THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION BECAUSE LARGELY WE DON'T ACCOUNT FOR- RACE IN IN THESE ALREADY AND I THINK THAT IT ACCOUNTS IT REQUIRES US TO RETHINK- ABOUT HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS- AND SEE IF THEY'RE WAYS TO LOOK AT GROUPS- BASED ON YOU KNOW THE GENERATIONAL HISTORY OF. LACK OF ACCESS TO- ISSUES LACK OF ACCESS TO- EQUITY AND PARTICIPATION IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROCESS- SO I THINK THAT HONESTLY IT'S MORE ABOUT A REFORMATION OF HOW WE THINK M. AND LOOK AT THESE POLICIES THAT'S WHY I THINK. WE MIGHT BE. I KIND OF SILENCE ON THIS IS. IT'S A REBUILD PROGRAM OF SORTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE AND. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO. SHARE TO THAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS SO I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE PANELISTS SO- ALL OF US KNOW THAT OUR VISION RATES HAVE. REALLY REFLECTED THE INEQUITIES WHEN IT COMES TO RACE- WONDERING WHAT SUGGESTIONS YOU WOULD HAVE TO US. AND HOW DO WE- BOTH DO A BETTER JOB OF TRACKING THESE OF ACTION RATES- SHOWCASING THE INEQUITIES AND WHAT MORE CAN WE DO THAT ONCE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION- TO CHANGE DIFFERENT AREAS OF LAW THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE. AND THAT RELATED TO THAT WANTED TO ASK WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE PROCESS FOR REPORTING FAIR HOUSING COMPLAINTS AT THIS MOMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL- WHAT FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATIONS LOOK LIKE IF THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO IN THAT AREA AS WELL. I APOLOGIZE ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THIS WE- AT THEIR DISPLACEMENT PROJECT OR THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING AS MUCH OF ACTION DATA AS POSSIBLE USING MORE ADVANCED DATA SCIENCE TOOLS SUCH AS MINING AND SCRAPING COURT RECORDS- AND WORKING WITH SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS TO LOOK AT RED. RIVER RESTITUTION THIS AS WELL AS- OBTAINING NOTICES- AND SO IT'S HARD YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET AT THE STATE OF BECAUSE IT'S HIDDEN AND MOST NATIONAL EFFORTS TO COLLECT THIS DATA HAVE. FALLEN SHORT ON THE WEST COAST AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPLEMENT THAT- I THINK SOME OF THE EFFORTS IN SAN FRANCISCO PARTICULARLY A RENTAL REGISTRY THAT HELPS- IDENTIFY. SEVERAL THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS ONE HOW MUCH- A RENTAL UNIT COSTS- IT WAS THEIR VACANCY WATER THE PROCESS SEES AND ALSO THE REPORTING STRATEGIES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE BIG FAN OR COMPLAINT. THERE NEEDS TO BE KIND OF A BETTER COLLECTION SERVICE BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. USING SOME- AT. BUT IT'S GOING REQUIRES TO. NOT REALLY NO WHAT THE STATE OF ADDICTION WILL BE FOR WHILE UNTIL THIS IS COLLECTED OR REQUIRED ADVANCED TOOLS AND EXPENSIVE- PROJECTS TO TRY AND COLLECT SOME SORT OF UNDERSTANDING OR AT LEAST GET A SIGNAL WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES RIGHT NOW IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW BAD. THE THE HOLE IN THE SHIP IS- IN PARTICULAR- BUT WE WITH LITTLE DATA WE CAN MAKE BIG PROGRESS IN AND- C. BIG CHANGES. SPACES BORN JUST MENTIONED- A COUPLE YEARS AGO I HI READ- TRULY OUTSTANDING WORK- BY MATTHEW DESMOND- THE HIS FAMOUS EVICTED POVERTY AND PROFIT- AND- HIS ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. IN MILWAUKEE AND IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY REALLY OPENED MY EYES UP TO WHAT MORE WE COULD ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT AS YOU WELL KNOW AS I'VE DISCUSSED WITH HIM- TO YOUR POINT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AND- VERY MUCH WOULD BE OPEN TO IDEAS AND HOW WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF UNDERSTANDING THE DATA BECAUSE- I THINK ONCE WE HAVE THE DATA. IT WILL- REALLY DRIVE THE CASE FOR WHY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY SO- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT- AT. SECOND QUESTION HAVE- AND I BELIEVE- I THINK IT WAS MISS BLOCK FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING LAW PROJECT HE- WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS. YOU DISCUSSED CRIME FREE HOUSING AND NUISANCE ORDINANCES AND THEIR DISPARATE RACIAL IMPACT. WONDERING IF OTHER STATES ARE DOING INNOVATIVE THINGS. IN THE AREA OF CRIME FREE HOUSING AND NUISANCE ORDINANCES THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IN CALIFORNIA- YES I MEAN THIS IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. OTHER STATES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPREHENSIVELY- BAND OUR PRION'S- NUISANCE AND CRIME FREE HOUSING ORDINANCES DAY PASSED SIMILAR PROTECTIONS TO THE BILL THAT YOU CHAMPIONED- AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTEEN- TO ADDRESS- SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- BEING AFFECTED FOR CALLING FOR POLICE OR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE. BUT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN VERY INNOVATIVE OUR SUCCESSFUL SOLUTIONS TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE- BANS THIS IS SOMETHING THE OTHER STATES ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW SO CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. BE OUT IN THE LEAD HERE. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WITHOUT ANY WELL BECAUSE WITH THAT I WAS JUST GOING TO OPEN UP FOR ANY FINAL COMMENTS THEY MIGHT HAVE- ANY OF THE PANELISTS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. AND WITH THAT I THINK THE STRUCTURE WILL TURN IT BACK TO YOU FOR THE FINAL PANEL. CREATES APPRECIATE TO THE SECOND PANEL A VERY. ENLIGHTENING LET'S NOT GO TO THE THIRD AND FINAL PANEL FOR TODAY REVERSING RACIAL INEQUITIES AND HOMELESSNESS- OUR NEXT WITNESS WILL BE TO MAKE A MOSS THE FOUNDER AND- CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT ALL HOME. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- MY NAME IS TO MICAH MAS AND I'LL BE SHARING A BRIEF PRESENTATION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. ROSS IF YOU WANT TO START YOUR PRESENTATION. YES I AM ACTIVELY DOING THAT AND I'LL STARBURSTS AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE FOR THE SECOND TIME TODAY AMAZON TO TALK ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. YOU TOO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S WE COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIM- LET ME JUST. CONCEDED SELECTION BAKER WHO. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE CAMELS TODAY ARE REALLY INTERRELATED FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- SO I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECTIONAL NATURE OF HOMELESSNESS WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE I THINK IT CONTINUES TO BE- CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GROUPS OF HOMELESSNESS IS REALLY ABOUT SAID JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ALL HOME WE ARE A BAY AREA ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON REGIONAL SOLUTIONS THAT DISRUPT HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND REALLY CENTERS ARE WORK AROUND RACIAL INEQUITIES- AND SO ON AGAIN REALLY GRATEFUL I FOR THE COMMITTEE- LIFTING THIS UP TODAY- WE THINK ALSO THAT THAT HOUSING SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED AND IN ORDER TO- ADDRESS THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST WITHIN THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION IT'S CRITICAL TO ALSO EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC- IMMOBILITY THAT EXISTS FOR MANY EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN IN- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS IN THE BAY AREA. SO I WANTED TO JUST WALK US THROUGH A LITTLE BIT NAY AND MUCH OF MY PRESENTATION IS GOING TO BE ON THE BAY AREA CONTACTS BUT JUST TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS CHALLENGES- BLACK CALIFORNIANS MANY WE ALREADY KNOW THIS THIS DATA IS VERY EXPLICIT- AROUND THE DISPROPORTIONAL IDEA OF HOW MANY- BACKGROUND IN INDIGENOUS FOLKS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION- IN THEIR OVER REPRESENTATION IN THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION. AND I WANTED TO LEAD WITH TALKING ABOUT SORT OF THE STRUCTURAL DRIVERS AROUND WHY THIS THESE DISPARITIES EXIST- I'M AND I'M BALLIN BLIND THEM HERE THERE ARE MANY OTHERS BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THESE SORT OF REPRESENT HOW WE GOT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE CONDITIONS THAT PERPETUATE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. INCOME INEQUALITY AND LACK OF INCOME ECONOMIC MOBILITY IS PERVASIVE AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT TREND THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATIONS THIS AFTERNOON- ESPECIALLY THE HISTORIC CONTEXT OF STRUCTURAL RACISM THAT HAS. REALLY SORT OF CREATED THE CONTAINER IN WHICH- HOMELESSNESS EXISTS- OUR RACIAL WEALTH GAP THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING VERY EXPLICIT ANTI BLACK HOUSING POLICIES WHICH MUCH OF OUR- SOCIETY HAS BEEN CREATED ON I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK THAT UP AS WELL AS THE OVER EXPOSURE TO THE CHILD WELFARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS THESE STRUCTURAL DRIVERS. ARE THE REASONS WHY YOU SEE SUCH A DESPERATE IMPACT ON THE BY PARK COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO HOMELESSNESS AND IT SORT OF OUTLINED- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY TAKING THIS ON AND ON AND CONFRONTING THESE DISPARITIES BECAUSE IF. WE DON'T TAKE IT ON HEAD ON. DOUBLE ON. AND TORE THOSE TO. IN OUR PROGRAMS HOMELESSNESS SYSTEMS AND OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO REVERSE THEM AND I WANTED TO JUST HIGHLIGHT WHAT CONTRA COSTA IS DOING IN TERMS OF ITS RACIAL EQUITY ASSESSMENT RELATIVE TO HOMELESSNESS. AND BY DISAGGREGATED DATA BY RACE THEY ARE ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHO'S ACCESSING WHAT SERVICES ARE THE SERVICES THAT CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TARGETING THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE. THIS SLIDE- JUST KIND OF BRINGS HOME- VERY CLEARLY AND OF COURSE THIS IS PRE PANDEMIC DATA SO- WANTING TO REFLECT HERE JUST THE SIGNIFICANT DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY IN- BLACK AND INDIGENOUS HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR. FIVE PERCENT- AT MORE THAN FIVE TIMES- THE GENERAL POPULATION OF BLACK AMERICANS IN THE BAY AREA- ARE REPRESENTED IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND TWELVE TIMES IN THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION SO AGAIN. DATA IS IMPORTANT BUT THE TO SHOULD BE A CATALYST FOR FIGURING OUT WHAT IMPACT WE NEED TO DO ABOUT IT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATION. TODAY I WANTED TO ALSO JUST ED ILLUSTRATES- THE WEALTH GAP. RIGHT ME WE OFTEN HEAR THESE STATISTICS WE SEE THE SLIDES BUT THIS IS PERVASIVE THIS GOES BACK FROM. NINETEEN NINEY TWO TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE KNOW THESE TREND LINES ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT. WITH HOW EVEN WITH MORE AWARENESS AROUND RACIAL EQUITY IN UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT'S GOING ON FOR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES THESE TREND LINES PROCESS SO I THINK THAT IT'S- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO NOT ONLY. UNDERSTAND THE DATA BUT THEN TAKE ACTION AROUND TRYING TO CHIP THOSE TREND LINES. AND THEN YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO THE ASSET BUILDING I KNOWINGLY EARLIER ON PANELS YOU TALKED ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP AND RENTAL HOUSING YOU KNOW THIS REALLY DEMONSTRATES HOW THE STIGMA THAT EXISTS AROUND SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND REFLECTING THAT IN FACT OUR HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ON THE ECONOMIC SPECTRUM. AND PREDOMINANTLY WHITE HOUSEHOLDS ACTUALLY RECEIVE A PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED TAX SUBSIDY UP FOR THEIR HOUSING BUT WE HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME FIGURING OUT SUBSIDIZED SOLUTIONS FOR PEOPLE ALONG THE LOWER ECONOMIC ECONOMIC SPECTRUM AND SO I WANTED TO JUST ILLUSTRATE HERE THAT- TAX SUBSIDIES ARE BUILT INTO HOW IN FACT PEOPLE- ACQUIRE WEALTH IN A CHOIR HOUSING AND WE NEED TO. HAVE EQUITY AROUND THOSE THOSE SUBSIDIES- IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES THAT EXCESS. AND THEN THIS IS JUST ANOTHER REFLECTION WE'VE ALSO JUST JUST CONCLUDED THE RENOWNED- COUNTS THIS IS JUST AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE DEARTH- HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES IN THE BAY AREA IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE WE ARE PUTTING OUR EMPHASIS ON OUR DEVELOPMENT PIPELINES. WE SEE HERE THAN ABOVE MODERATE. pPRODUCED DISPROPORTIONATELY TO WHERE WE NEED IT THE MOST WHICH IS THE LOWER END OF THE ECONOMIC A SPECTRUM AND AGAIN. CONSISTENT WITH THE TREND LINES THAT WE'RE SEEING BASED ON THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT EXIST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OUR FORMALLY HOMELESS AND- AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND I ALSO WOULD SAY. WE HAVE HAD A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PARADIGM AROUND THE ONLY HOUSING WE THINK ABOUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALL HOME IS REALLY TRYING TO DO IS SHIFT THAT NARRATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYONE NEEDS. DEEPLY NEEDS SUPPORTED HOUSING A LOT OF FOLKS JUST NEED DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THEIR INCOMES CAN COVER AND SO YOU MAY HAVE PEOPLE WHO NEED SOME SERVICES BUT THEY DON'T NEED ONGOING COMPREHENSIVE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE CONTINUUM OF NEED AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE HOUSING OPTIONS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING SERVICES- THIS THIS LINE IS JUST A REFLECTION I THINK OF I THINK IT WAS ME MERIEL OR THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER REALLY- TALKING ABOUT LISTENING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A CRISIS AND BEING VERY COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW WE TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM DOESN'T NEED TO BE THIS COMPLEX BUREAUCRACY THAT WE CREATED IT ACTUALLY CAN BE VERY SIMPLE IF WERE LISTENING AND CENTERING THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERTISE EXPERIENCE AND SO I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS CRISIS TALK ABOUT IT AND HOW AS POLICYMAKERS AND LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONS HOW WE NEED TO REALLY LISTEN AND INTERPRET NOT NOT USE OUR OWN INTERPRETATION BUT REALLY HEAR WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CREATE POLICIES TO DELIVER ON THOSE SPEEDS AND THIS IS JUST A COUPLE OF AB REFLECTIONS DIRECTLY FROM- THE SOME FOLKS THAT WE'VE INTERVIEWED DURING THE CALL THE CRISIS IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE NATIONAL INNOVATION SERVICE- THE GOOD NEWS IT IS FOLKS IN COMMUNITY ARE ALREADY WORKING ON THIS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME EFFORTS HAPPENING ACROSS THE BAY AREA DESTINATION HOME- DID A RACE AND HOMELESSNESS REPORT RECENTLY WHERE THEY ARE- HIGHLIGHTING A COUPLE OF VERY KEY STRATEGIES TO ENSURE. THAT BEARER ADDRESSING THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THEIR COMMUNITY- ALAMEDA COUNTY OF COURSE IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN FACT HAS BEEN SORT OF. A PIONEERING SOME OF THIS WORK AND IS REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE ANALYSIS AND SYSTEMS MODELING THAT THEY HAVE DONE ACROSS. THE COUNTY IN THE CITY'S- AND THEN OF COURSE SAN FRANCISCO DID- AND THEN AN ASSESSMENT AS WELL AROUND THERE HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM. AND SOME OF THESE BULLET POINTS SORT OF REFLECT. VERY TACTICAL INTERVENTIONS AROUND ASSESSING RESEARCH RACIAL EQUITY. OUT OF YOUR PROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENTATION TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN COURSE CORRECT AND IF YOU'RE SEEN DISPARITIES PERSIST PROCESS LIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN SOME COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DISPARITIES ARE ARE PERSISTING. AND HOW DO YOU GET IT THOSE AND YOU KNOW. REALLY FREE DESIGNER- READ MORE ENSURE STRATEGIES. SO THE LAST TWO SLIDES HERE MY PRESENTATION OR JUST SORT OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS AS I SAID WITH LIVED EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE ARE NOT JUST AT THE TABLE TO HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR THEM. BUT THAT THERE ARE PART OF THE PROGRAMMING THEY'RE PART OF THE POLICY MAKING THE FUNDING DECISIONS RIGHT HOW DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE COURAGE TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. WHEN YOU DON'T FOCUS ON SOMETHING IT DOESN'T GET DONE. APPLYING A RACIAL IN EQUITY LENS ALWAYS REALLY MEANS. NOT JUST DOING IT AT THE FRONT END OF YOUR SYSTEM BUT REALLY TESTING OUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE SEEN THE DISPARITIES THAT THAT PROCESS- NUMBER THREE I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND SPEAKS TO. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBER ASKED EARLIER ABOUT CREDIT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRUCTURAL RACISM MUCH OF HOW OUR HOUSING POLICIES WERE DESIGNED ARE REALLY IN THAT IT IS IN STRUCTURAL RACISM AND EXCLUSION. OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE BLACK BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND TEST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF STRUCTURAL RACISM THROUGHOUT EVERY INTERVENTION THAT WE HAVE AND SO I THINK THAT KIND OF BROWN'S ARE WORKING I REALLY- I THINK IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND SORT OF HOW. STRUCTURAL RACISM SHOWS UP IN SPECIFIC POLICIES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AROUND THAT. LAST POINT HERE IS JUST AS I SAID HOUSING SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ARE REALLY- CONNECTED AND WE NEED TO BE DOING INTERRELATED POLICY WORK IN ADVOCACY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. NOT ONLY THINKING ABOUT OUR SUPPLY A PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION OF TENANTS AND HOUSING BUT WE'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE INCREASE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE. ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THEN THIS IS MY FINAL SLIDE JUST LIFTING UP TO ME YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T A CHOICE THAT'S WHY I'M SO HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY IF WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HOUSING JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE THE HISTORIC- DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES PROCESS IT'S A FACT WE HAVE IMPERIAL EMPIRICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THAT AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO KEEP THAT AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE. THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY BEFORE I TURN IT OVER- BACK OVER TO THE COMMITTEE IS ALL HOME IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE FULL SPECTRUM OF INTERVENTIONS THAT RELATE TO HOMELESSNESS SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT REALLY REQUIRES AN INVESTMENT IN PREVENTION HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT HOUSEHOLDS DON'T BECOME HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO RENTAL ASSISTANCE LEGAL SERVICES AND SO FORTH TO KEEP THEM HOUSED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECOGNIZING THAT THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE ON THE STREET TODAY NEED TO BE BROUGHT INDOORS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR US TO ALLOW OUR NEIGHBORS TO LANGUISH ON THE STREET. WHILE WE BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE SO WE THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INTERIM HOUSING OPTIONS AND THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM A SUBSIDY TO- NON CONGREGATE SHELTER WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP PEOPLE INSIDE AND SAFE SO THAT WE CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY BE LOOKING FOR PERMANENT HOUSING EXITS WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA DESERVES A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND WE THINK IF WE ARE DOING ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS PREVENTION INTERIM HOUSING AND PERMANENT HOUSING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THOSE SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE A POPULATION LEVEL REDUCTION. IN HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR PRESENT IS MORE. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PROFESSOR- FROM THE RECTOR OF RESEARCH EVALUATION AT THE NATANSON FAMILY RESILIENCE CENTER AT UCLA PROFESSOR NOR RITA NUMBER. STILL. GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO THANK FONG CHAIRS CHIU AND GRAYSON AND THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AND THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY I AM PRESENTING FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A RECENTLY COMPLETED MIXED METHODS STUDY OF RETENTION AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR BLACK CLIENTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY CONDUCTED THROUGH THE POLICY OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB AT UCLA THIS STUDY GREW OUT OF OUR WORK WITH THE LOS ANGELES HOUSING SERVICES OF PARTY OR LHASA. AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PEOPLE WITH LIVED IT. OF HOMELESSNESS SO ARE MIXED METHODS APPROACH INCLUDES BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS WE FOCUSED ON RACIAL INEQUITIES AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING EXPERIENCE THAT IS RETURNS TO HOMELESSNESS AMONG BLACK CLIENTS WE EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA FROM A HOMELESS. BUT AS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FY I HMIS TO ESTIMATED RETURN OR ITS OWN RACE ETHNICITY FROM. TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE COLLECTED QUALITATIVE DATA AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY VIA INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS FROM GROUPS WITH A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM- AND CASE MANAGERS AND LYFT CLIENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY BLACK CLIENTS WERE RETURNING PEOPLE HOMELESSNESS. WE FOUND POLITICAL ENDS ARE THE LARGEST GROUP OF SINGLE ADULT CLIENTS IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO RETURN CALL LISTENERS. WE BELIEVE THEIR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PLACEMENT AND RETURN TO AND AN ARM HOUSING ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS IN LOS ANGELES BLACKLINE'S ARE 38% MORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS THEN WHY CLIENTS. SO THE MAJOR THINGS THAT IN THAT REGION ARE QUALITATIVE FINDINGS WERE WHITE BLACK CLIENTS EXIT HOMELESS- OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND RETURNED HOMELESSNESS R. ONE PERMANENT. SUPPORTIVE HELLO. HELLO PROGRAM AND LYFT VOLUME HAVE BEEN PERCENT. OF THE- OF SUPPORTIVE. PROGRAM MANAGERS REPORT. PERCEIVING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS A LONG TERM HOUSING SOLUTION BLACK LIVES REPORT PRECEDING FIRST PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS SHORT TERM HOUSING SOLUTION AS A STEPPING STONE TO PERMANENT HOUSING SUCH AS JANET AID HOUSING. TO SOME BLACK CLIENTS EXIT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DUE TO SPENDING CONCERNS ABOUT HOUSING AT SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND EXPERIENCES OF SEGREGATION DISCRIMINATION AND STEPPER. EXPENDITURES FOR POOR BLACK CLIENTS RECALLS IT HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY RACIAL AND ETHNIC SEGREGATED COMMUNITIES AND HOUSING WERE INLAND PORTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT BLACK CLIENTS PROGRAM AND CASE MANAGERS REPORTED BLACK CLIENTS WERE HELD TO STRICTER LEAST LEASE AGREEMENTS THEN ON BLACK CLIENTS. AND PERCEIVED AS MORE DANGEROUS UNINTELLIGENT OR MENTALLY INCOMPETENT AND ON BLACK CLIENTS BY SOME PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING STAFF. BLACK CLIENTS REPORTED THEY WERE NOT TREATED AS ADULTS OR DEHUMANIZED AND EXPERIENCED. PREJUDICE FROM SOME OF OUR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING STAFF THREE SOME OF MY CLIENTS AND SAID PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DUE TO AN ADEQUATE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. CASE MANAGEMENT TURNOVER IS HIGH BECAUSE OF THE LOW SALARIES- BUILDING TRUST BETWEEN OUR CLIENTS IS LIMITED BY THE LACK OF CASE MANAGERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE A LACK OF BLACK CASE MANAGERS PROGRAM AND CASE MANAGERS. REPORTED STARTING SALARIES. WHERE A LOT OF RELATIVES IN TO THE CAR WILL IN AND APOSS ANGELES. AND CASEMENT OFTEN WE FROM AGENT. AGENTS FIRST CELL INCREASE. BLACK INS REPORT THE NEED FOR MORE PEER NOW WILL PUT EXPERIENCE K. MANAGER REPORT THAT. AND TRUST ONE EXCUSE. PROGRAM ADDED REPORTED THAT RECRUITMENT RETENTION OF CASE MANAGERS SHOULD FOCUS ON CASE MANAGERS OF COLOR INCLUDING ADDRESSING BIAS. IN THE PROVINCE. HOW'S IT WORKING. SO ARE RECOMMEND FOR THE JUST. TO BE KEPT DRESSED INEQUITIES THE RETENTION OF BLACKLINE IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING R. ONE AUDIT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PLACEMENTS FOR EQUITY AND INCLUSION TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND CAPACITY FOR INVESTIGATION OF ENFORCEMENT AGAINST FAIR HOUSING VIOLATIONS THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THREE MANDATE INLAND FAIR HOUSING RULES AND REGULATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES PLEASE S. AND STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ACROSS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS. THREE SUPPORT FUNDING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGEMENT TO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR CLIENTS UP TO A YEAR AFTER THAT EXUBERANCE. HOUSING THE CREATION OF A CASE MANAGEMENT CAREER. WITH CONSISTENT I'D LINES ACROSS AT THE PORT OF HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR BOTH COST OF LIVING INCREASES AND MERIT BASED PROMOTIONS- ON. AND REGULAR INTERESTING CASE MANAGER. OF I'M TRUMP PRACTICE COMMUNITIES. AND RESOURCES AND OTHER AREAS LIKE ENOUGH BY CASE MANAGERS AS SUBSTANTIAL FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- LAST SUPPORT FUNDING TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT GUIDELINES ACROSS PERMANENCE OF HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR PEER ADVOCATES TO HELP TRANSITION PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS INTO CASE MANAGEMENT GROUP ROLE CASE MANAGER PIPELINE SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR. TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE ASK IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THAT'S ENOUGH I HAVE A FEW- WOULD LIKE TO ASK BOTH OF YOU. THERE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE AT LEAST ONE TIME FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS- TO MOVE FOR A NUMBER OF FRONTS AND WONDERING. WHAT YOU THINK OF AS FAR AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR VALUATION METRICS THAT OUR STATE SHOULD CONSIDER- AS WE PROVIDE THIS MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. TRACKING AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESSING THESE DISPARITIES AND- ASSUMING WE IDENTIFY THESE DISPARITIES WHAT WOULD BE YOUR TOP STRATEGIES FOR ELIMINATED THEM. HAPPY FOR YOU TO YOUR ANSWER. I'M SORRY I WAS HAVING TROUBLE TAKING MYSELF OFF OF NEW I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK ONE OF THE- HE STRATEGIES IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO STANDARDIZE OUR DATA. PRACTICES AND HELPING TO INCENTIVIZE LOCALITIES. DISAGGREGATE THEIR DATA BY RACE AND ETHNICITY- AND HAVING THAT LEADERSHIP FROM THE STATE TO INCENTIVIZE THAT TYPE OF DATA COLLECTION I THINK WOULD BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- BECAUSE HE YOU KNOW. WE ALSO CAN USE GEOGRAPHIC TARGETING- WHERE THERE IS IT THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE- GRANT BURDEN- THE AND I THINK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS PAYING MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY- WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED ARE PAYING EIGHTY TO A 100% OF THEIR INCOME TO RENT AND SO I THINK WE CAN. REALLY FOCUS ON METRICS THAT. ALIGN WITH WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING- THERE HOUSING CRISIS FOCUSING ON THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND- AND CENSUS TRACTS AS WELL AS- HAVING A STANDARDIZED DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM THAT LOCALITIES BUYING INTO THAT THE STATE SUPPORTS THAT INCLUDES INCOME- BRAZEN ETHNICITY DATA SO THAT WE CAN THEN THE- PROPORTION OUR RESOURCES TOWARD REDUCING THOSE DISPARITIES. AND THEN THE OTHER THING I'D SAY IS- THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE TYPICALLY USE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS BEARING BYE. BY ETHNICITY- AS AS AS COMMUNICATED BY MY COLLEAGUES AND SO. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO HOW DO WE LOOK AT- INCENTIVIZING SHALLOW SUBSIDIES BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE I THINK THE- HOUSE OF HOMELESSNESS- SYSTEM IS REALLY FOCUSED ON CREDIT SITTING. AND THE LONGER PEOPLE END UP BEING EXPOSED TO HOMELESSNESS THE MORE SUPPORT THEY'RE GOING TO BE BUT IF WE CAN GO A BIT UPSTREAM AND INSURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEEK HELP. THEY CAN GET THAT HELP SOMETIMES IT'S AS LITTLE AS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE BECOMES HOMELESS OR NOT AND SO REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE. ACCESS TO LOWER SERVICE. NEEDS IN ADDITION TO AGAIN BUILDING OUT AS MUCH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WE CAN IN PROVIDING PERMANENT HOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOMES. I THINK MIGHT BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO JUST READ. WHAT MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS LAW SAYS SAID PIPE. BOMB ONE OF THE IT IS BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO DISAGGREGATE DATA BY BRITAIN'S F. THIRTY WE DO NEED TO SEE THAT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE STATE WE DO THAT DISAGGREGATION. A WITHIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE DO RELY ON THE H. MY HAS SYSTEM WHICH DOES PROVIDE THIS APPLICATION SO THAT'S ONE. POINT. THAT I WILL PUT IT RIGHT. SO POINT THAT I WILL TO READ. THAT COMES THROUGH OUR FINDINGS AND WAS SPOKEN TO BY A SMALL SWITCH IS TRULY INCLUDE THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT THERE WAS A WAY. TO INCENTIVIZE SOME OF THAT IN THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS THAT WOULD BE GOOD AND THE THIRD PIECE IS REALLY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THERE REALLY IS VERY XIN AMONG PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ATTENTION TO BOTH. I DO THINK UPSTREAM PREVENTIVE PEACE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SINCE WE HEARD IN OUR SMALL STUDY WITH. OUR SMALL SAMPLE OF PARTICIPANTS EVERYONE DOES NOT SEE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IT IS THE END WROTE AND EVERYONE DOES NOT NEED. THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT- PLIGHT AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THERE IS A VARIATION OF WE NEED TO GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT. AND ARE FROM. THANK YOU THANK ONE FINAL QUESTION- YEAR OF A BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT. WHICH IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE REVOLVING DOOR BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOMELESSNESS GIVEN THAT. WE KNOW THAT HALF OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SLEEPING ON OUR STREETS OF CALIFORNIA AT NIGHT HAVE HAD SOME INTERACTION WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO PUT SAVINGS FROM PRISON CLOSURES TOWARD SUPPORT OF HOUSING FOR THOSE WERE LEAVING. THE SYSTEM AND I WANT TO ASK WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WOULD WE BEST DIRECT THAT MONEY- WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO INVEST IN TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRYING TO REENTER. SOCIETY GET THE RESOURCES AND WE DO THIS IN A WAY- THAT- THAT THAT ALLEVIATES THE INEQUITIES OVERSEEN WITH REGARD TO RACE. CALL ME MAYBE I'LL- KICK US OFF AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW ONE OF. THE THINGS I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL IS. IF WE'RE ABLE TO CONVERT THOSE SAVINGS INTO RESOURCES THAT END UP PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORTS FOR FOLKS WHO- ARE FORMERLY INCARCERATED I ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO START DOING THAT PLANNING WHILE PEOPLE ARE STILL INCARCERATED. BEFORE SOMEONE IS RELEASED FIGURING OUT A HOUSING PLAN WITH FOLKS WHO ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ENSURING THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY TIED TO THEIR EXIT. RATHER THAN THEM HAVING TO COME OUT AND GO SEEK- AND FIND PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS I THINK- IS A CHALLENGE AND SO PUTTING THOSE RESOURCES ACTUALLY. ARE ATTACHED TO BOOKS REMITTANCES WORKING WITH PROBATION DEPARTMENTS WORKING WITH PAROLE AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE SO WHEN SOMEONE IS INCARCERATED YOU START THAT PLANNING SIX MONTHS THAT YOU'RE BEFORE THEIR RELEASE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SEAMLESSNESS COORDINATION BETWEEN THEIR EXIT AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE WHEN THEY COME HOME AND TRY TO RE INTEGRATE INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHERE TO FIND HOUSING RESOURCES I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN. BEING ABLE TO DIRECTLY TIE FUNDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED IT'S CRITICAL AND YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND SOME OTHER THINGS HAVE TO USE. OTHER PROXIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE RACIAL DISPARITIES BUT I WONDER. IF THERE'S A WAY IF. WE ARE USING. THAT ARE- THAT ARE THAT COME BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF PRISON CLOSURES THAT THAT WE MAKE A DIRECT CONNECTION TO CONNECT THOSE RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF OUR OUR- OUR SYSTEMS AND SO THOSE ARE SOME IDEAS THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S DIRECT CONNECTIVE ITTY. TO THE RESOURCES- WHEN A PERSON IS RELEASED IN THAT THE MONEY ACTUALLY FOLLOWS THE PERSON AND THAT IF THE MONEY IS BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT THAT PERSON KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE TO GO BECAUSE THAT IS A PART OF THEIR HOUSING- PLAN AS THEY'RE BEING RELEASED. SUPER HELPFUL I APPRECIATE THAT. WELL LET ME GIVE BOTH OF YOUR OPPORTUNITY OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH US- TO- TO CONCLUDE TODAY'S HEARING. IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEYVA SAID. MY FINAL COMMENT I REALLY THINK MY CLUB COMMENT BILLS BACKED WHO- YOUR FOCUS ON ON. PEOPLE LEAVING OTHER PRISON SYSTEM AND REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO WOODWARD- LISTINGS COULD PREVIOUS SESSION REALLY THINKING ABOUT TYING FUNDS TO PEOPLE IS THAT LEAVING THE SYSTEM WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS WORKING IN BOTH PRO BOWL AND PROBATION BUT REALLY THINKING IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIE A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. INTO THAT PROCESS AND TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR CASE MANAGERS WHO REALLY CAN'T WORK SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS POPULATION SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LEAVE YOU WITH AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO A PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR HAVING ME I THINK MY FINAL REMARKS SEARCHES THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENTERED IN- TO INVEST IN PREVENTION INTERIM HOUSING AND PERMANENT HOUSING SIMULTANEOUSLY WE NEED THAT SYSTEM HELLO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE OUR INTERVENTIONS BASED ON WHAT PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE AND I THINK WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM OF INTERVENTIONS THAT WE NEED. THE OTHER LAST WORD IS SCALE AND IMPACT IF WE WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE NEED A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND THE HOUSING CRISIS AND WE ARE REALLY RELYING ON OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO HELP COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE DO THAT AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MEANT TO THAT- PERSPECTIVE AROUND A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS AND- WE'VE A BILL. AB SEVENTY ONE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THAT I KNOW THIS CONVERSATION IS ONGOING. SO ONE OF JUST THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR THIS GREAT DISCUSSION TODAY. I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND SAY TO THE OPERATOR. IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY WISH TO SPEAK. A FEW PLEASE OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES.
