AREAS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED AS

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.084
A RESULT OF A DEAD TREE HITTING

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.119
A POWER LINE OR BLOCKING THE

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:26.719

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.788
THE CPC RESPONDED BY REQUIRING

MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.928
THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ACTED IN

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.030
PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.498
REQUIRED THAT ANOTHER HUNDRED

AND TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.802
BIOMASS ENERGY BE PROCURED.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.103
IN ALL THERE ARE SEVEN CONTRACTS

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.072
SIGNED AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:47.907
MANDATES AND THEY REFUSE

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.742
REFERRED TO AS BIRAM CONTRACTS.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.643
ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.945
REQUIRED TO GET A SPECIFIED

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.379
AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM THESE HIGH

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.681
HAZARD JONES.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:55.982
HOWEVER THE UNINTENDED

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.084
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS REQUIREMENT

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.486
IF IT FOREST WASTE THAT IS

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.354
DEEMED TO BE FROM A HIGH HAZARD

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.990
ZONE NOW COST MORE THAN FOREST

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.658
WASTE THAT COULD CAUSE A A

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:06.559
WILDFIRE.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.061
SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PAY A

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.729
PENALTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.864
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HIGH

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.632

RANDOM TARGET SAID ON THE LAST

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.503

WITH REGARDS TO WILDFIRE.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.218
THE NAPA COUNTY WILDFIRES DIDN'T

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:34.721
CONTAIN THESE HIGH HAZARD JONES

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.222
AND NEITHER DID PARADISE RATHER

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.624
THAN WAIT UNTIL A DEVASTATING

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.325
WILDFIRE DESTROYED THE COMMUNITY

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.994
BEFORE REMOVING THE FUEL WE

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.995
WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT IN FRONT

TO PREVENT THE NEXT MAJOR

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.132
WILDFIRE.

EXPERIENCE WHICH IS DRAMATICALLY

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.257
HEIGHTENED MY SENSE OF URGENCY

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.092
FOR REDUCING FIRE RISKS AND OUR

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.659

THIS ACCESS TREE MORTALITY.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.407
AT THE TIME THIS MADE SENSE A

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.308
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:03.409
TREES WERE DEAD STATEWIDE

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.278
HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.279
THE STATE WAS RUDELY AWAKENED TO

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.014
THE FACT THAT THE GREATEST

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.048
THREAT TO OUR FORESTS AND

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:09.816
CITIZENS.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:10.984
HAD SHIFTED FROM DEAD TREES TO

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.186
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES CAPABLE

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.454
OF WIPING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OFF

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.489
THE MAP IN MERE HOURS.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.557

ITS HIGH HAZARD MAPS MULTIPLE

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.326
WATERSHEDS COVERING PORTIONS OF

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.961
PARADISE AND CON CAL TO NOT HAVE

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.099
DESIGNATION AS HIGH HAZARD

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.767
FURTHERMORE NOT ONE OF THE

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.035
EVACUATION ROUTES OUT OF

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.237
PARADISE WAS DESIGNATED AS A

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:32.505
HIGHER PRIORITY TEAR ONE'S OWN.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.307
NEITHER WAS A TRANSMISSION LINE

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.075
WHICH ALLEGEDLY STARTED THE

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.810
WORST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.846
WITHOUT SUCH DESIGNATION BIOMASS

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.748
FACILITIES SUCH AS BERNIE FIND

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.216
THEIR HANDS TIED FROM HELPING TO

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.984
REDUCTION EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.085
I BELIEVE THESE FACTS ALONE IN

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.620
LIGHT OF THE CAMPFIRE ILLUSTRATE

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.822
THE THREAT HAS SHIFTED SINCE THE

INCEPTION OF THE POWER AND

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:50.990

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.358
IN CLOSING I WOULD OFFER THAT

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.793
THERE'S CURRENTLY NO VIABLE

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.795
ALTERNATIVE TO BOMB OUTS FOR

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.430
TREATING OVERSTOCK FORESTS.

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.998

PROGRAM MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.636
REDUCTION OF CATASTROPHIC

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.938
WILDFIRE IN THE STATE WITH SB

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:11.144

BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE -- I

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:18.518
REPRESENT THE OTHER BY AROUND

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.163
SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.764
LOOKING AT THE DEFINITION OF A

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.566
HIGH HAZARD ZONE YOU'RE TELLING

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.335

SOME OF THIS IS ELIGIBLE TO GO

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.877
TO BUY A MASS PLANT BUT YOU TURN

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.079

IT'S LKE FIND THEIR BIOMASS

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:01.694
PLANTS WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.463
SURVIVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.098
IT'S THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE

FORESTED AREA IN CALIFORNIA.

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:43.082
WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING OUT A NET?

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:45.284
THAT WIDE THAT TREMENDOUSLY

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.621
DILUTES YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.657
THE REMOVALS THE FORCE WOULD

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.726
REMOVALS FROM THOSE PLACES THAT

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.095
YOUR GAMING TO BE TRULY HIGH

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.296
RISK TO SAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.465
ACROSS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:00.699
ACRES AND NOW ALL OF THOSE WOULD

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:01.267
BE.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.269
AT THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIORITY

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.837
COMPLETELY DILUTES OUR ABILITY

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:08.040
TO DIRECT THIS EXPENSIVE.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.609
TOOL TOWARDS REMOVING FAT BM I

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:13.545
AM AS FEEDSTOCK FROM THE FOREST

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:17.483
NOT TO BE CLEAR -- BOMB AT THE

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:18.384
BOMB AS FEEDSTOCK IN MY OPINION

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.686
MY ORGANIZATION SHOULD NOT BE A

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:21.720
DRIVING FACTOR FOR OUR

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:22.988
MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN THE

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:25.424
FOREST IT SHOULD BE A TOOL AND

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.960
NOT DRIVING WHERE AND WHEN WE

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:28.327
PULL OUT.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.696
PULL OUT WOULD AND THAT IS VERY

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:32.164
MUCH ARE CONCERNED AS WE LOOK AT

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.699
BIO RAM IN THESE TYPES OF

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:35.901
PROJECTS AND SECONDLY THERE IS

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.803
MUCH DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.538
EVEN IN AREAS WHERE IT'S ALREADY

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.774
BURNED -- IF IF YOU'RE NOT

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.076
MAKING THESE REMOVALS AS PART OF

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.078
A PLAN ALL OF THAT SAID. FOR THE

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.180
PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE AND

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.248
FOR PURPOSES OF THE BILL WE

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.949
BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF WHAT IS IN

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.618
THERE IS ACTUALLY TAKING US AWAY

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:53.652
FROM THE FOCUS.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.621
OF PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.756
FOCUSING ON AREAS WHERE FEET

00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:00.092
STOCK REMOVAL WOULD ADVANCE

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.960
MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES FOR THAT

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:03.162
REASON WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSED

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:06.265
AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.267

IN OPPOSITION.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.672
I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:15.574
PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.810

OF UP INITIALLY.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.287
SEVERAL YEARS BACK I REMEMBER.

00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:31.256
A NUMBER OF OF DEAD TREES AT THE

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.226
HEIGHT OF THE AT THE DROUGHT WE

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:37.262
WERE LOOKING AT ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.497
MILLION AND THEN THAT NUMBER

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.232
SHUT UP TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.400
MILLION.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.035
AND I I I THINK THE CURRENT

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.871
ESTIMATES ARE ON HUNDRED FORTY

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:46.505
EIGHT MILLION AND WE'RE LOOKING

AT THOSE -- THOSE NUMBERS HAVE

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.809
INCREASED OVER THE PAST SIX

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:53.245
YEARS APPROXIMATELY [inaudible]

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:57.850
OF NOT QUANTITY.

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.519
HOW MUCH WAS STILL?

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.087

FORCE MATERIAL SO THERE'S A

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.066
LIMITED NUMBER ABOUT MASS

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.635
FACILITIES TAKING FORCE MATERIAL

RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THE SEVEN BIO

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.141
RAM PLANS AND THEN A SMALL

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.243
HANDFUL THAT AREN'T BY AROUND

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.312
PLANTS THAT AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR

YOU KNOW HOW.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.115
MANY OF THOSE ARE SO.

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:09.054
OF THREE FOUR SO WE CAN SAY MAY

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.022
BE.

00:18:10.088 --> 00:18:10.956
ARE APPROXIMATE ABOUT TEN PLANTS.

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.192
YES.

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:14.193
AND APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH

WE'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF THE

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:23.836
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS OF

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:26.805
MATERIAL EVERY YEAR.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.874
AND LARSON H. WOULD THAT BE OF

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.876
THE AMOUNT OF TONNAGE THAT'S A

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:31.810
THAT'S CURRENTLY.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:35.147
IN THE FOREST.

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:35.781
SO THEY'RE JUST DEALING WITH IT

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.282
REGIONALLY.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.718
SO THERE THAT THE COMMENT ABOUT

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.586
YOU KNOW THIS LIGHTS UP THE

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:43.755
ENTIRE STATE IS -- ONLY TALKING

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:45.424
AS IF I HAD BIOMASS PLANTS

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.292
ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE SO IF I

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.861
LOOK AT OUR REGION BERNIE FOREST

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.462
POWER FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE JUST

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.997
GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT'S NEEDED

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.332
IN THEIR REGION IN THE MATERIAL

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:54.800
THAT'S OUT THERE AND AVAILABLE

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.835
IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.303
SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.073
FACILITY ONCE YOU DO IS TACKLE

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:01.807
WHAT'S WHAT YOU CAN

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:04.109
REALISTICALLY GET AT IN THAT

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:05.344
REGION AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.578
WHAT WE'RE TALKING OUR REGIONAL

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.447
SOLUTIONS NOT NECESSARILY

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.048
STATEWIDE SOLUTIONS YOU HAVE.

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.116
YOU HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:12.351
LIMITED YOU KNOW AROUND THE

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.186
STATE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.221
SAYING THESE BIOMASS PLANTS ARE

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.357
PROPOSING TO ONLY HANDLE STUFF

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:22.094
IN AND AROUND THEIR VICINITY

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.327
NUMBER.

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.495
ONE AND THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:24.162
[inaudible]

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.231
HI.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.667
OF VERY HIGH FIRE PRONE AREAS

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.235
AROUND THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS I

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.303
THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IS

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.438
THAT THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE AROUND

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.040
ANY PARTICULAR.

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.742
IN PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.810
IS YOUR BIO MASS FACILITY -- IT

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.479
DOESN'T COVER EVERY HIGH

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:41.980
PRIORITY AREA.

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:44.750
HI HAZARD ZONES WERE DEDICATED

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.151
TO DEAD AND DYING TREES.

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.120
NGUYEN WE'RE NOW ASKING IN THIS

00:19:48.186 --> 00:19:50.489
BILL TO LOOK AT FIRE --

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.724
SEVERITIES.

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.293
SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IS THAT

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.261
IN THAT REGION FOR EXAMPLE

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:57.029
BERNIE FORCE POWERS SITTING

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.664
RIGHT HERE COULD SPEAK TO THAT

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.899
MORE SPECIFICALLY -- IN THEIR

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.467
REGION THEY HAVE AREAS THAT ARE

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.770
HIGH HAZARD ZONE AND AREAS THAT

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.572
THEY CAN REASONABLY GET.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:09.474
TO THAT OUR HIGH FIRED HAZARD

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.809
ZONES SO.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.078
WHAT IS TO SAY THAT THIS AREAS

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.279
OKAY TO DELIVER MATERIAL TO

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.848
THEIR BIOMASS PLANT IN THEIR

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:17.082
REGION?

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:19.851
THAT THIS THIS AREA CANNOT

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:20.419
THAT'S WERE TRYING TO TACKLE

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:22.154
HERE.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.722
ENOUGH AND IS DETERMINES THAT

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.358
THE RAIN DETERMINE WHAT IS

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:28.193
ACCESSIBLE WHAT ISN'T.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.063
USUALLY PRICE IS A GOOD --

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.332
FACTOR IS THE PROJECT THAT OUT

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.501
THERE IS THERE IS THERE FUNDING.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.036
IN THAT PROJECT TO GET THE

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.939
MATERIAL OUT.

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.374
SO SOMETIMES THE PROJECT WILL

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.110
ALLOW YOU TO CUT THE TREES DOWN.

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:46.345
BUT A GOOD PROJECT WILL ALLOW

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.913
YOU TO CUT THE TREES DOWN AND

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.548
TAKE ALL THAT FOREST WASTE AND

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.116
MOVE IT OUT TO A BENEFICIAL

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:52.217
REUSE LIKE BY MASS.

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.652
ABOUT IT WE WE WERE MENTIONED

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.354
HERE THAT THIS WASN'T A PRICE

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.589
BILL THAT WASN'T -- A RATES

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:00.726
BILLS THAT IN FACT RATE PAYERS.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.260
BUT YOU KNOW I I'M JUST WHAT I'M

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:04.029
GETTING AT IS AT THE TIME THAT

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.397
THIS WAS APPROVED AND AT THE

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:10.002
TIME THAT WE DID -- APPROVE --

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:13.005
A. B. -- EIGHT FIVE NINE THERE

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.706
WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.675
WERE GONNA USE BIOMASS PLANTS

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.044
TOO GOOD AT THE HIGHEST THREAT

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:23.248
BECAUSE USING BIOMASS PLANTS TO

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.717
HANDLE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.619
MILLION.

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:28.954
TREES IS JUST NOT.

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.922
OF FUEL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:31.923
JUST NOT RIGHT.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.258
I MEAN WHAT ARE WE GETTING OUT

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:35.694
OF HERE IF. FOR TELLING PEOPLE

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:36.862
THAT -- THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.697
SAFE FROM THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE

00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:40.832
BY MASS IS GOING TO HANDLE IT --

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.768
I THINK WE'RE COMPLETELY

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:45.137
MISLEADING THE PUBLIC HERE.

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:47.205
AND AND THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:50.175
WE HAVE TO WEIGH.

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.576
ON THE THERE'S COSTS THERE IS.

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.245
THERE IS EMISSIONS WHICH IS VERY

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:55.047
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WERE FIGHT

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.082
FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.284
AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T -- FIGHT

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:01.086
CLIMATE CHANGE WITH MORE

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:02.354
MISSIONS.

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:02.921
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THESE

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.157
FIRES ARE VERY [inaudible]

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:08.126
OF YOU KNOW A FULL OF THE

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.095
MISSIONS.

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.230
WAY MORE WAY MORE AND AND AND

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:15.333
THE THE OF THOSE EMISSIONS.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.668
OF THE MISSIONS OF BIOMASS PALE

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:19.004
IN COMPARISON BUT WE'RE ALSO

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:22.307
TALKING ABOUT -- WHAT WHAT IS

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:24.509
ESSENTIALLY A FAILED POLICY OF

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.845
DEALING WITH THIS THIS THIS --

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.081
THIS WASTE.

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:32.250
SO THIS IS WHERE I AM I'M I'M

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:35.187
HOW DO WE TO TELL PEOPLE OKAY

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:37.456
WE'RE GONNA REDUCE THE STANDARD.

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.990
SO THAT YOU CAN GET AT THE HIGH

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:42.127
BUT IGNORE THE VERY HIGH.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.196
AND AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:45.297
TAKE WELL THAT'S FOOLISH.

00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:47.899
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:49.134
AND AND THAT'S WHERE I AM RIGHT

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:53.205
NOW WHY WOULD WE DO THAT.

00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:55.340
IF I MIGHT CENTER -- WHAT I

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:57.576
THINK IS HE? ONE OF THE DYNAMICS

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:59.111
AND AND WHAT WHAT I THINK YOU

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:00.245
WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.180
CALIFORNIANS.

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.648
IS THAT THE ADMISSIBILITY SHEL

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:06.351
DESIGNATION. FOR THE DEAD AND

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.754
DYING TREES.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.123
IT WAS AN AREA IN THIS YEAR AS

00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:13.658
WHERE THERE ARE VERY FEW HOMES.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.261
THIS IS AN AREA THAT -- HIGHLY

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:18.830
FORESTED -- A FAIR AMOUNT OF IT

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:22.167
AND DID -- THE US FOREST LANDS --

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.369
AND NOT LANDS WHERE WE HAD TO

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:27.139
HOMES AND PEOPLE LIVING -- THE

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.207
EXTENSION.

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:31.209
OF THE BIRAM CONTRACTS TO BE

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.978
ABLE TO USE MATERIAL THAT'S IN

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.079
THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.080
[inaudible]

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.348
PICKS UP.

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:37.816
THE COMMUNITIES.

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.284
WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE WHILE

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:40.786
IN URBAN INTERFACE?

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:42.621
AND SO AND THOSE ARE VERY STRONG

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:45.624
ARGUMENTS SO SO VERY STRONG BUT

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.125
THE CURRENT LANGUAGE.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.894
THE ADDRESS WRITTEN AS YOUR

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.496
PROPOSED DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT.

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:53.431
AND I'D BE WILLING TO TO AYE

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:55.667
OKAY WITH THIS MY MY LANGUAGE

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.869
MAY BE A LITTLE TOO STRICT.

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.638
BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:02.207
GOING AFTER FUEL IN AREAS THAT

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.477
ARE HIGH AND DENSELY POPULATED

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:06.745
WAR POPULATED.

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:09.047
VERSES OTHERS THAT ARE NOT I

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:09.614
THINK GIVEN.

00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.185
THAT WE HAVE.

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:18.056
SEVERE LIMITATIONS AND THIS IS.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.091
AGAIN I HAVE TO STRESS HOW.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.593
I MEAN YOU CAN'T VEN IDENTIFY

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.829
WHETHER YOU'VE MADE A DENT.

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:26.231
IN THIS IN THIS PROBLEM.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.899
IT WE'VE ONLY SEEN THE AMOUNT OF

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.936
MATERIAL GROW WITH THIS POLICY.

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:32.504
BUT IF YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.239
SOME AREAS SAY FOR USING THIS --

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.674
I'LL BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.709
BUT CURRENTLY THIS THIS LANGUAGE

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.711
IS NOT COVER THAT ASPECT OF IT.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.179
AND WHAT I WOULD BE A FEEL

00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:42.180
COMFORTABLE DOING AT LEAST

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.448

TO VISIT SEVERAL FILE WICKS

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.543
PLANTS.

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:32.877
BIOMASS PLANTS SHOT THROUGHOUT

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:33.611
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.113
HOMES SIT IDLE BECAUSE THEY DO

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.115
NOT HAVE THE FEEDSTOCK THAT'S

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:40.952
READILY AVAILABLE. TO HELP OUR

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.153
LOAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.988
A COMMONSENSE MEASURE AND THE

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.023

ONE IN WHEAT THAT HAS.

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.296
BLESSED IN PRICE SIX YEARS OLD --

00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:52.997
WHEN HE STATED OUR PLANTS THEY

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:55.934
BURN WAY MORE TRASH IN DENMARK

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.035
AND BIO WASTE?

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:58.136
AND IT'S NO POLLUTION AIR

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.271
POLLUTION STANDARDS ARE HIGHER

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:02.307
THAN CALIFORNIA MANY WAYS SO THE

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:03.541
CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THIS IS

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:06.711
GOING TO CREATE MORE GREENHOUSE

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:07.846
GAS EMISSIONS WHEN.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.481
IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO FORCE

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:11.583
FIRE SO -- AND TO SAY THAT IT'S

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:13.151

WIND AND SOLAR NO ONE WAS

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.288
CONCERNED ABOUT RATE PAYERS SO I

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.456
THINK THIS IS PART OF THAT

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:19.958
DIVERSIFIED.

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.559
OUR ENERGY PORTFOLIO THAT WE'VE

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.328
ALL TALKED ABOUT SO I STRONGLY

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:24.863
SUPPORT THIS MERGER.

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:27.098

GENERATE ENERGY AS OPPOSED TO

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.505
BURNING IT OUT IN THE FIELD IS

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.873
REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:59.036
DESPITE THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS --

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:01.139
THE SEEP CPUC ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:09.213
SAVINGS FROM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.417

EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS HAS BEEN

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:26.097
FOUND TO RESULT IN THE 2240%

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.498

00:40:57.988 --> 00:40:59.557
MONEY OR ACTUALLY COUNTS PRIVATE

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.025
MONEY AGAINST THE PROJECT.

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:02.526
ACCOUNTS EIGHT EIGHT COUNTS

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.327
PRIVATE MONEY AND PRIVATE

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.094
INVESTMENT.

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:06.797
AS A FORM OF REPAIR FUNDS AND IN

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:09.300
DOING THAT BASICALLY THEY HAVE.

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:11.202
CREATED A SYSTEM IN WHICH THESE

00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:13.671
PROJECTS LOOK LIKE THEY ARE MORE

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.639
EXPENSIVE TO THE RATE PAYER THAN

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:17.141
THEY ACTUALLY ARE AND THAT'S

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.108
COUNTED AGAINST THE PROJECT

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.043
SECOND THING IS.

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:21.846
THEY NEVER -- US YET COMPARE

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.581
ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO THE COST OF

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.382
PROCUREMENT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.585
ANTITHETICAL SINCE IN MANY CASES

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.587
IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT CHEAPER.

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.522
AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS --

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:35.059
THAT THEY ACTUALLY LOOK AT AT DO

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.660
A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:38.796
CUSTOMER TO DETERMINE.

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:40.865
WHETHER THE CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.533
MADE THE IMPROVEMENT ANYWAY AND

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.702
THEY USE THAT TO DISCOUNT THE

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:47.504
ACTUAL VALUE OF THE PROJECT.

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.139
SO ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.641
SORT OF ANTIQUATED WAY OF

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.243
LOOKING AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY NOT

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.811
ALLOWING IT TO BE COMPETITIVE

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.613
WITH OTHER RESOURCES.

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.114
IS HOLDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.149
BACK MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PAY

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:03.654
THE WAGES THAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.256
PROJECTS WANT TO PAY.

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:06.090
AND SO WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING --

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.591
AS TIME MOVES ON TO WORK ON THIS

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.526
ISSUE -- WITH THE AUTHOR AND

ANTICIPATED THE DOUBLING OF

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.636
ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOALS ENERGY

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:20.304
EFFICIENCY COMPANY SINCE THEN

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.573
HAVE LEFT THE STATE AND SO HAS

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.408
SOME OF THE WORK FORCE THAT WE

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.443
RELY ON AS A RESULT OF THESE

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.712

PROJECTS WRIT LARGE IN THE

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.557

WIFE OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.051
THRESHOLD IS SAD.

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.486
IS THAT JUST RANDOM ISN'T BASED

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:44.521

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:46.724
CAME OUT OF A ROSS SAYS WITH

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.725
THAT LARGER COALITION THAT WAS

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.393
REFERENCE TO CHAIRMAN WITH THE

THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:53.697
AND SOME THEM -- ECONOMIC

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:56.133
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.234

WHO WAITED WHERE IT USUALLY

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.941
COSTS WOULD YOU GET FOR FIFTY

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:04.842
THOUSAND YET WHAT ARE WE LOOKING

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.680
ZERO GRAHAM THAT IS.

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.815
SUPPORTED BY THE THE P. UC'S

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:12.082
PROGRAM.

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.118
SO.

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:15.619
CHECK THIS PLACE.

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:16.854
AS SOON AS CHAIRMAN -- TWO GOOD

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.888
EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE FOR

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:20.858
INSTANCE A MEDIUM SIZE MAYBE

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:21.692
THREE STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:22.926
THAT NEEDS.

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:24.328
NEW HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:26.063
SYSTEM AND A NEW COOLING TOWER

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.565
WHICH ARE TWO HUGE ENERGY USERS.

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:29.900
I KNOW THE ADEQUATE AND OUTDATED.

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.368
CERTAINLY THE FIFTY THOUSAND ONE

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.669
PAY FOR ALL THAT WORK BUT IT

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.671
WOULD IT BE YOU KNOW -- A REBATE

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.240
THAT WOULD ALLOW A PROJECT

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:37.574
HONORED WILL MOVE FORWARD ON

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.076
DOING THAT TYPE OF WORK.

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:41.078
OR IT MIGHT BE GOING INTO A

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.047
MEDIUM SIZE COMMERCIAL BUILDING

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:45.349
AND REPLACE REPLACING ALL OF THE

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.251
LIGHTING FIXTURES. TO HIGH

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.385
EFFICIENCY LIGHT FIXTURES AS

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:50.521
WELL AS IN INSTALLING --

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.755
ADVANCED LIGHTING SO THE REBATE

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.590
WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE FIFTY

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.259
THOUSAND COST OR WHAT WHAT WHAT

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:57.528
WOULD BE THE THE REBATE ITSELF

00:44:57.594 --> 00:44:58.896
THE THRESHOLD IS FIFTY THOUSAND

00:44:58.962 --> 00:44:59.129
DOLLAR.

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.864
SUCH A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.499
REBATE OR MORE YEAH OKAY SO IT

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:03.967
APPLIES TO THE PRINT NOT THE

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:09.173
PROJECT COSTS BUT THE REBATE

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.441
COST [inaudible]

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:12.543
OKAY.

00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:14.411

THIS BILL IS NOT.

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:28.959
INTENDED TO APPLY TO DVRS SOLAR.

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.027
I KNOW THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:32.062

TO DO THIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.380
WORK BUT I GUESS MY CHALLENGES

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.748
WHEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY REFERRING

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.116
TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:00.150
ONLY REASON THEIR DISADVANTAGES

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.185
THAT THERE NEVER GIVEN THE

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:01.985
OPPORTUNITY IT'S NOT THERE.

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.220
THAT THEY LACK THE SKILLS SAID

IN MANY CASES THERE THIS NEVER

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.489
GIVEN OPPORTUNITY SO THAT'S WHY

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.423
THESE CONTINUE TO STATE.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.791
DISADVANTAGE WHAT WILL BE THE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.760
OUT REACH TO REALLY TAP INTO

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.067
THESE PROJECTS.

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.869

TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE AN AGING

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:12.022
WORKFORCE IN SO THOSE PRE

SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:24.801
ALLOWS AN EQUIVALENCY.

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.036
FOR WORKERS ARE HAVING GONE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.004

AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.443
PREREQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS --

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.045
THAT'S REALLY WITH A BIG BURDEN

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:36.980
IS BECAUSE THE THE UNION SECTORS

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.482

TRAINING PROGRAMS AND -- I THINK

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:51.962
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:54.998
LEGISLATURE COULD TO FOCUS SOME

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:57.267

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:00.923
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:54.243
AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL.

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.344
THE LOSS OF THOSE TOWERS

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:56.578
PREVENTED OUR ABILITY TO SEND

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:59.281
OUT ALERT AND WARNING.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.483

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:10.859
THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

CRITICAL NOTIFICATIONS.

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:24.840
THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.575
