KNOWING WHAT IT WAS I TOOK THE

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.802
STEP OF PUBLISHING

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:15.006

THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL.

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.306
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:49.874
PANDEMIC AT THIS TIME IS

00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:51.075
SOMETHING THAT WE HAD THOUGHT

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:53.277

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:55.346
WE KNOW OF THE SURGES TO COME

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.114
AND THE DIFFERENT RULES. BUT IT

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.483
WAS THIS VERY SAME PANDEMIC

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.552
THAT FORCED THE LEGISLATURE.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.253
OUT OF SESSION FOR

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.721
APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS AND

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.590
PART OF THE SUMMER. AND WE

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.725
DECIDED WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.961
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STEP IN TO

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.729
TEMPORARILY FILL THE VOID THAT

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.998
WE KNEW YOU WOULD CONSIDER ONCE

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.967
YOU CAME BACK FROM BEING OUT OF

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.602
SESSION. AND THAT'S WHEN WE

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.704
PASSED AS YOU HAVE REFER TO THE

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.672
ORDER THAT STOPPED UNLAWFUL

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.908
DETAINER EVICTIONS THE ORDERS

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.843
THAT SET NO BAIL BECAUSE WE

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.945
WERE CONCERNED AS A JUDICIARY.

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:29.480
ABOUT INFECTIONS IN THE JAIL

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.648
AND PRISONS AND THE

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:33.117
TRANSFERENCE OF THAT INTO THE

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.453
COURT HOUSES. YOU KNOW WITH A

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.121
STATEWIDE RULES I WANT TO SAY

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.756
ONE THING OR TWO THINGS

ACTUALLY STATEWIDE RULES AS YOU

KNOW ARE RIFE WITH CHALLENGE

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.029
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS SO

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:47.465
DIVERSE. I STATEWIDE RULES ARE

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:49.300
RIFE WITH CHALLENGE BECAUSE SO

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.769
MANY TIMES WE ARE OFTEN ACCUSED

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:53.671
AT LEAST I HAVE BEEN IN MYRIAD

TRUST. AND STATEWIDE ORDERS

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:13.357
ALSO CAN BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.326
THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.461

SO SIMPLE TO SAVE A STATEWIDE

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.478
RULE WOULD WORK. BUT WE KNOW

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.313
THAT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.716
BANDAID THAT REALLY SUFFICES TO

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:41.452

HELP ORDERS. THE MYRIAD

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.725
CHANGING STATEWIDE ORDERS THE

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.627
DIFFERENT. THAT THE DIFFERENT

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:59.130
EXPERTS. THE DIFFERENCE IN

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.365
SIZES OF COURTROOMS AND HERE IS

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:04.401
THE KEY. OUT RIGHT FEAR OF

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:07.338
JURORS TO COME TO COURT. JUDGES

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:08.606
ARE PUT IN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:11.442
SPOT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE SO

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.210
MANY PEOPLE TO COME TO COURT SO

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:17.515
THAT. AN ACCUSED MAY HAVE THEIR

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.683
DAY IN COURT. ARIF TO COME IT'S

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.018
NOT THE THEY DON'T WANT TO FEEL

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.653
OUT THE RISK OF OTHER DUTY

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.021
THERE ARE FREIGHT EVEN THOUGH

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.657
THE COURTS HAVE PLEXIGLAS AND

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:29.226
THERMOMETERS I EVERY MATTER OF

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:31.328
PROTECTIVE GEAR. WHO CAN BLAME

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:33.130
TEACHERS FOR BEING AFRAID NO I

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:34.632
USED TO BE A TRIAL ATTORNEY I

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.534
MYSELF DON'T WANNA JUROR WHO'S

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.502
AFRAID TO BE IN COURT WITH ME.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.770
AND SO IT MAKES IT VERY

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.806
DIFFICULT BUT IMPORTANTLY TO

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.741
REMEMBER THAT EVEN WITH THE

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.509
OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY I

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:47.812
MERGING SEE ORDERS ARE COURTS

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:50.581
HAVE NEVER CLOSED I AM AWARE OF

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:52.349
ONLY TWO COURTS THAT CLOSED.

00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:54.051
DURING THE INITIAL PERID OF

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:56.120
THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS PRIMARILY

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.055
TO CLEAN TO START UP AND START

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.324
OVER. BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BASED

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.792
ON MY READING OF FOUR HUNDRED

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:03.027
AND SEVENTY AND COUNTY

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.496
EMERGENCY ORDERS. ALL COURTS

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:07.631
HAVE REMAINED OPEN THEY OFFER

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.700
REMOTE HEARINGS MANY ARE

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.802
OFFERING JURY TRIALS BUT THE

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.137
JURY TRIALS ARE BEING

00:41:13.204 --> 00:41:15.506
INTERRUPTED BECAUSE A JUROR IS

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:17.908
EXPOSED A STAFFER IS EXPOSED AN

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.877
INMATE IS EXPOSED AND THEY END

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.979
UP BEING MISS TRIED AND WE

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:25.282
START OVER AGAIN. ADDITIONALLY

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:27.151
TO BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:28.886
COURTHOUSES SORT OF LIKE

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:31.555
SCHOOLS WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:33.390
NUMBERS AND CRITICAL MASS

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.925
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SOCIALLY

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.927
DISTANCE. SO OUR BRICK AND

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:39.730
MORTAR IS SOMEWHAT A BARRIER TO

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.632
THE ABILITY TO CALL MASS GROUPS

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:44.201
OF PEOPLE TO SIT FOR JURORS.

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:45.469
SOME COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:47.304
INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE AND A

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:49.773
CONTRACTED OUT WITH GYMS AND

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.408
SPORTS ARENAS IN ORDER THAT

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:54.144
THEY CAN BRING IN JURORS AND

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.546
SOCIALLY DISTANCE THEM TO

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:58.082
SELECTORS. SO THIS IS A LONG

00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:59.950
WAY OF SAYING. THAT WHILE WE'VE

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:02.286
BEEN OPEN AND IF WE'RE NOT

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.988
WORKING ON THE CASE THE TRIAL

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:06.257
JUDGE'S ARC ARE VALUABLE COURT

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:08.225
STAFF OR COURT EMPLOYEES WERE

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.894
NOT WORKING ON A CASE WE'RE

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.929
MEETING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:13.230
WITHOUT LEGAL AID WITH

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:18.035
PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS WITH.

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:18.669
DEFENSE LAWYERS WE'RE TRYING TO

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:19.336
FOR FIND BETTER FOR WHERE HE IN

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.371
THE- ABOUT WHAT WORKING WHAT

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:23.073
ISN'T WORKING. I ALWAYS ASK FOR

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.508
WHICH COUNTY ARE YOU HAVING

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.076
PROBLEMS IN BECAUSE WE CAN GET

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:28.312
MESSAGES AND HELP AND BEST

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:30.214
PRACTICES TO THOSE COUNTIES

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.649
WHERE THEY MAY BE A PROBLEM.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.784
BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.619

IF UP AND WHY AND WHY NOT. SO

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:07.950
THIS IS ROBERT A YOUNG I CAN

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.086
ANSWER THAT- REGARDING THE

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.188
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.757
COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE THAT VERY

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.359
IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT EACH OF

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.361
THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS HAVE

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.696
DIFFERING INFRASTRUCTURE SO I

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.565
HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES AND

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:25.268
REQUIRE DIFFERENT TOOLS- SO HE

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:27.236
DON'T PRESCRIBE ANY PARTICULAR

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.872
TOOL FOR THE COURTS. HOWEVER WE

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.308
DO HAVE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.143
CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:35.044
RESOURCE GUIDE THAT JUDGE

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.712
ANDERSON MENTIONED A SET OF

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.614
BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:41.450
THAT ALL COURTS- CAN TAKE A

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.586
LOOK AT TO ENSURE THAT. THE

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:47.757
PUBLIC- RECEIVED THE BEST-

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:50.560
POSSIBLE- EXPERIENCE WHEN

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:51.894
INTERACTING WITH THE COURT AND

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.095
SO THESE ARE THINGS LIKE MAKING

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.198
SURE THAT THE VIDEO IS CLEAR

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:56.999
MAKING SURE THAT THE AUDIO CAN

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.100
BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.835
COURTROOM. SO ALTHOUGH WE DO

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:02.505
NOT HAVE A SINGLE PRESCRIBED

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.641
PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY WE DO HAVE

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:09.478
A SET OF- BEST PRACTICES THAT

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:10.479
THE COURTS CAN LEVERAGE TO

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:12.715
ENSURE- A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.116
THE PUBLIC. SO DOES THE

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.418
JUDICIAL COUNCIL MAKES A

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.353
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.788
USE OF- DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.256
OR IS IT ENTIRELY UP TO THE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:24.760
JUDGES HOW TO MAKE THE DECISION-

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.028
SO IT'S TYPICALLY UP TO THE

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.930
COURTS TO MAKE THAT DECISION-

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.065
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WILL

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.733
PROVIDE SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.102
IN TERMS OF. CAPABILITIES AND

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.838
IN PARTICULAR- SECURITY- BUT

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.406
AGAIN WE WON'T PRESCRIBE A

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.342

VACCINATE FOLKS BUT YOU KNOW.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.495

WITH IN THE COURTROOMS. A JUST

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:26.522
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.524
THE EFFORTS TO VACCINATE- SOME

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:30.559
OF THE JUDGES AND WORKERS AGAIN

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.328
WE'VE GOT LIMITED RESOURCES I

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:34.196
JUST RAISE IT IN THE- IN THE-

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:36.098
ARRAY OF ISSUES THAT WE REYES.

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.467
TALK ABOUT AND SECONDLY. IT'S

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:41.037
ALLUDED TO AND- DIVERGING TALKS

ABOUT. IT TALKS ABOUT IT IS.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:47.977
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:48.544
EXPEDITE THOSE CASES WHERE.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.812
SOMEONE'S DYING OR THERE IS IT

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.013
WE SEE THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.415
CASES I KNOW THERE'S SOME THE

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.816
GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT IT BUT

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.052
THERE ARE CERTAIN CASES WHERE

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.753
TIMELINESS OF PRECEDING. IS

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.854
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.056
PRESERVING EVIDENCE ORDER

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.458
PRESERVING A CASE OF LITIGANTS

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.193
OR WHATEVER TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.829
THAT TO SOMEHOW- EXPEDITE THOSE

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.098
PROCESS THESE- TO. TO DEAL WITH

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.433
THOSE VERY SENSITIVE CASES

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:13.002
PEOPLE ARE BEFORE. OF THE

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:16.605
JUDICIAL BRANCH. I CAN ADDRESS

THAT IF YOU'D LIKE AND THIS IS

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.508
JAKE ANDERSONI THINK IT

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.244
DEPENDS IN SOME RESPECTS ON THE

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.779
COURTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:25.981
PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. WE

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.650
DO HERE IN MARIN COUNTY

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:29.852
PRIORITIZE THOSE CASES- WE

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.855
STILL HAVE OUR FULL A JUDICIAL.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.191
RESOURCES FOR THE CIVIL MATTER

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:36.726
IN FACT I AM ASSIGNED TO THE

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.094
CIVIL CALENDARS AND HAVE BEEN

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.929
HANDLING THOSE CASES LIKE I

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.263
MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.299
PREVIOUSLY SOME OF THE CASES WE

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.067
ALLOW TO BE SUBMITTED ON THE

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:46.302
PAPERS WITHOUT HAVING TO COME

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.204
INTO COURT SOME OF THE PAPERS.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.205
SOME OF THE CASES WE HAVE

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:50.906
PERMITTED TO GO BY WAY OF

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.041
REMOTE PROCEEDINGS EITHER

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:53.876
THROUGH VIDEO. A SOME THROUGH

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.978
COURT CALL IF IT'S NOT A TRIAL

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.047
ITSELF SO WE DO EACH COURT

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.648
WORKING THERE PASSED WITH UNDER

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.283
THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAVE.

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:04.353
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE PRIORITY

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.822
CASES YES IT HERE TOO- WE ALSO

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.224
HAVE PRIORITY OF JUVENILE

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.892
MATTERS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:10.393
MATTERS WE HAVE JUVENILE

FAMILY LAW MATTERS CUSTODY

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.602
VISITATION SUPPORT AND SO WHEN

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.771
YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.340
PRIORITY TYPE CASES. AND THAT

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:25.975
THE AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICAL

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.877
SPACE AND REMOTE SPACE AND THEN

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.145
YOU HAVE TO DO AS I MENTIONED

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.380
EARLIER WORKED AT TRIAGE BUT

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.450
PIPELINE ALL ALWAYS KEEP MOVING

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.385
THINGS FORWARD. AND AS DATA

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:40.523
BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.224
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. BUT

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:48.831
WE ARE WORKING HARD AT IT AND.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:49.598
I ASKED ONE CAN QUESTION. YEAH

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.433

POINT TWO THAT'S A

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:04.113
COMMISSIONER. BUT OUT OF THE-

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.449
CASE. TWENTY TWO JUDICIAL

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.184

MONTEREY COUNTY WERE FORTUNATE.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.456

THEN WE HAVE JUVENILE AT A

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:20.029
DIFFERENT PORT HOUSE. SO IT

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.664
ALSO DEPENDS ON YOUR PHYSICAL

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.499
SPACE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE-

ARE WE GET ADDRESS THAT BACKLOG.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:26.622
THE DRESS THAT FOR YOU AND THE

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.258
MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO EACH ONE

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.392
OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.161
DEPENDING ON THEIR BACKLOG THE

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:34.296
INITIAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:35.898
PRO RATA AND THE SECOND WAS

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.133
BASED ON DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.835
BASED ON THE COURT'S BACKLOG IN

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.237
EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:43.272

THEIR OWN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:50.179
AND SO EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT

01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:52.247
COURTS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:54.416
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND BASED

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:56.318
ON THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE SO

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.287
WE CANNOT ANSWER UNIVERSALLY IN

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.389
TERMS OF WHAT EACH COURT IS

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:02.191
GOING TO DO FOR EXAMPLE I CAN

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:03.993
GIVE YOU- JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.427
AND MONTEREY SUPERIOR COURT WE

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:06.261
MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:07.796
CHALLENGES THAT LOS ANGELES MAY

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:09.331
HAVE. I'LL GIVE YOU A PICTURE

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:13.102
IF YOU HAVE A HUGE- CRUISE SHIP

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:13.969
YEAH WITH THOUSANDS OF

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.672
PASSENGERS THEN YOU HAVE A

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:19.975
SPEED BOAT OR KAYAK OLD ARM YOU

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.143
KNOW MANEUVER DIFFERENTLY

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.344
DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.846
OF THE OCEAN TE WHIMS AND

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.047
EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON OUT

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.282
THERE AND SO THAT IS WHAT'S

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:28.584
HAPPENING IN EACH ONE OF THE

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.486
COURTS IS THAT THEIR LEADERSHIP

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.388
IS DECIDING BASED ON DATA AND

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.889
HAVING DATA AND FORM THEM. IN

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.424
TERMS OF HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.326
THE BACKLOG HOW TO ASSIGN NOT

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:38.861
ONLY JUDICIAL RESOURCES BUT

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:41.130
STAFF RESOURCES- IN ORDER TO

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.464
ASSIST IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:47.102
MATTERS. ARE HEARD AND CASES

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:48.337
ARE PROCESSED. AND WHAT YOU

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:52.207
THINK AMOUNT IS TO. COURT UP

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.643
LEVELS. AT THIS TIME WE'RE

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:58.414
STILL GATHERING DATA- TO ASSESS

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.715
THE BACKLOGS I BELIEVE THIS

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.283
YEAR THAT CAN SPEAK WITH

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.785
RESPECT TO THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:04.420
BACKLOGS THAT EACH COURT HAS

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.522
BASED ON OUR SURVEY BUT AS WE

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.824
GATHER MORE DATA AS WE SEE WHAT

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.426
COURTS ARE DOING IN ORDER TO

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.828
WORK THROUGH- THE BACKLOG. HOW

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.196
TECHNOLOGY IS ASSISTING AND

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.698
HELPING WHETHER WE BALANCE

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.499
PHYSICAL ACCESS REMOTE ACCESS

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:18.901
AND MAKING SURE WE DO HAVE

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.103
EQUAL ACCESS. THEN DATA WILL

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.939
INFORM US IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:27.776
NEEDS WILL BE. THANK YOU. THANK

ONE THANK YOU- PERCENT GABRIEL-

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.261
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.163
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NEEDED FOR

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.365
THE REMOTE TO ACCESS TO

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.901
JUSTICE- ENDED FOLLOWING UP

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:55.204
WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUE MYSELF

HER- ON THE COST. OF THAT TALK

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:00.743
ABOUT THE CONSPECIFIC LEAP FOR

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:02.611
UPDATED TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.446
SOME COUNTIES THAT CAN ACCEPT

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.248
THE REMOTE OR THAT TO BE THE

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:09.618
ELECTRONIC FILINGS SOME CANNOT.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.520
SOME CAN PROVIDE THE REMOTE TO

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.021
TURN HEARING SOME CANNOT SO

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:15.691
EVEN IF WE LOOK AT THE MINIMUM

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.926
THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO EACH OF

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.762
THESE COUNTIES. HAS THERE

01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:21.597
ALREADY BEEN ASKED ABOUT ON THE

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:24.666
COST JUST TO BRING THEM TO A

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:30.305
MINIMUM. SO I CAN ADDRESS THAT

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.174
PAIN IS ROBERT A YOUNG- IN

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.542
TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE TOTAL

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:36.145
COSTS- FOR BRINGING PEOPLE UP

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.546
TO WHAT WOULD CONSIDERED EIGHT

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.448
MINIMUM LEVEL HOW WE HAVE NOT

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:42.084
LOOKED AT THAT AS A WHOLE. I

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.652
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A VERY

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:46.121
COMPLICATED SITUATION WHERE

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.757
EACH OF THE COURTS HAVE- QUITE

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.626
A FEW DIFFERENT DEPENDENCIES

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:52.594
ARE REGARDING THEIR LOCAL

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.097
INFRASTRUCTURE- THEIR LOCAL

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.698
ABILITY TO UTILIZE

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:59.668
TECHNOLOGIES. AND SO THROUGH-

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.603
FUNDING REQUEST BUDGET CHANGE

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:04.139
PROPOSALS HOW WE AND THROUGH

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:05.941
THE MODERNIZATION FUNDING THAT

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.943
WE RECEIVE. I'LL WE HAVE

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.312
ALLOCATED THAT OUT TO THE COURT

01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:12.481
SO THAT THEY CAN PRIORITIZE AND

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.583
THEY CAN IMPLEMENT BASED ON

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.785
THEIR LOCAL CONSTRAINTS- WE DO

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.320
HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.422
BASICALLY OUTLINES. THE BASIC

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:22.291
CAPABILITIES OF ELECTRONIC

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:26.461
FILING- DIGITAL- DOCUMENTS-

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:28.964
REMOTE HEARINGS AND AGAIN IT'S

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:31.667
EACH OUR COURT HAS THEIR OWN.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:34.570
LIMITATIONS AND THEIR OWN-

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:37.139
AREAS OF FOCUS BASED ON THEIR

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:38.640
LOCAL POPULATION AND THEIR

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.609
LOCAL PARK OPERATIONS. SO WE

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:42.411
DON'T HAVE AN OVERALL COST FOR

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:48.116
THAT HOWEVER EACH COURT IS.

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:48.817
MOVING TOWARDS THAT AND STOP.

COURT BUSINESS REMOTELY OPEN

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.173
NINETEEN IS TURN THE JUSTICE

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:18.480
SYSTEM HERE UPSIDE DOWN. JURY

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.682
TRIALS ARE CANCELED IN PERSON

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:33.695
HEARINGS ARE POSTPONED. TRIALS

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:34.930
BEING SLOW THANKS TO

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:38.901
CORONAVIRUS. ALSO JUST WHY IT

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.403
RIGHT NOW ROTAVIRUS HAS FORCED

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.206

MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I'M

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:24.166
I HAVE A KIND OF FOLLOWING UP

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:26.902
FOR A QUESTION FOR MR YOUNG AND

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:29.704
JUDGE ANDERSON. AND THIS SORT

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.373
OF A TOP LEVEL OVER ARCHING

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.408
QUESTION THAT I THINK WE NEED

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.644
TO ALTERNATELY GET TO AND BASED

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:36.978
ON WHAT YOU EXPLAINED IT AND I

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.847
HATE THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:42.784
COMMENTS. TO POINT BECAUSE WE

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.453
STRUGGLE WITH. SETTING

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:46.188
STATEWIDE STANDARDS IMPOSING

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.989
THAT LOCALLY AND I AND I KNOW

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:48.590
THAT THOSE ARE SOME CHALLENGES

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:52.928
HERE. BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:55.730
THAT YOU CAN KEEP THAT THE

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:58.633
CULTURE THE NATURE OF YOUR

01:18:58.700 --> 01:18:59.835
FIFTY EIGHT INDIVIDUAL.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.637
COUNTIES THE COURTS FUNCTIONING

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.406
BUT STILL BE ABLE TO SET

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.241
STANDARDS SO THAT WE DON'T SEE

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:08.710
DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:11.580
JUSTICE COUNTY TO COUNTY TO

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:14.082
COUNTY. AND I THINK SOME OF THE

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.851
DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN SHOWS THAT

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:16.785
THAT DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVE

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:19.421
DIFFERENT. CONSTRAINTS TO

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.623
DIFFERENT RESOURCES AND- WHICH

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.892
LEADS TO A REALLY DIFFERENT

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.027
ABILITY TO ACCESS JUSTICE AND

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:26.995
SO WE TALKED ABOUT IS

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.930
TECHNOLOGY SOME OF THIS IS

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:31.666
PHYSICAL SPACES. BUT I THINK WE

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.869
ULTIMATELY NEED TO HAVE A PLAN

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.438
AND ADD AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.173
WE CAN GET TO SORT OF WHAT

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.542
BASIC LEVELS OF ACCESS OR

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.244
ACCEPTABLE OR WE SHOULD BE

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:45.280
SHOOTING FOR. AND THEN HOW WE

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:47.349
ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE COURT

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.684
CAN MEET THAT STANDARD AND I

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:51.119
THINK IF WE CAN HAVE THAT

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:54.089
CONVERSATION COLLECT THAT DATA

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.123
I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.759
WILLING. TO LOOK AT THAT AND

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:01.229
ENSURE THAT WE BUILD. PROOF

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:03.832
AGAINST. A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.167
THIS WILL HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.334
GONNA CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THIS IN

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:11.573
THE FUTURE BUT BUILD SOME.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.775
BUILD A BETTER SENSE OF ACCESS

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:16.411
AND CONTINUITY AMONG ALL OF THE

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.847
COURTS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. SO

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:23.652
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THAT.

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:25.754
WELL I CAN GO AHEAD AND- START

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.523
WITH THAT ANYTHING- THE WAY THE

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.991
JUDICIAL BRANCH IS STRUCTURED

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.526

01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:22.717
LIKE A DISPARITY THERE WITHOUT

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.991
IT'S CONTINUING TO THE DIALOGUE

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:39.294
AND DATA COLLECTION AND

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.095
ASSESSING WHAT THE NEEDS ARE UP

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.463
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.598
AT YOU KNOW FROM JURISDICTION

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:46.167
TO JURISDICTION OFTENTIMES. IT

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:47.869
MAY BE DEPENDENT AGAIN LIKE I

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.971
SAID ON ON PHYSICAL ABILITIES

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.573
OF THE COURTS TO REALLY PROCESS

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.875
ALL THOSE CASES ARE YOU ABLE TO

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.777
BRING PEOPLE INTO THE BUILDING

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:56.978
DO YOU HAVE THE REQUISITE

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.680
AMOUNT OF STAFF TO BE ABLE TO

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.381
DO THE JURY TRIAL DO YOU HAVE

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:02.216
THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF STAFF

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:03.885

HAVING HALL IN SAFETY MONITORS

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.490
WHEN HAVE WE EVER HAD TO HAVE

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.892
SAFETY MONITORS OF THE WHOLE

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:11.793
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:13.094
SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THERE'S

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.796
NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE INSIDE THE

01:27:14.862 --> 01:27:18.499
COURTROOM SO I THINK B. R.

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.100
FIFTY EIGHT COURTS THROUGH THE

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.301
TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.903

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMMITTEE. I

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.206

AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:28.476
DISCUSSIONS I BELIEVE THE-

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:30.678
THERE'S ALREADY THE STATUTORY

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:33.047
AUTHORITY OPTS FOR THE JUDICIAL

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.483
BRANCH THE CHIEF JUSTICE. TO BE

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.652
ABLE TO ASSIGN CERTAIN CASES TO

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:38.987
TWO DIFFERENT CONTIGUOUS

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.588
COUNTIES AND THINGS OF THAT

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.656
NATURE BUT I THINK THERE ARE

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.891
ANSWERS ANSWERS OUT THERE WHICH

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:46.394
REQUIRE STUDY AND DATA ANALYSIS

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:48.363
AND FURTHER CONVERSATION SO

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.797
THAT WE CAN SEE WHAT ARE THE

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.567
BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE- AGAIN.

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:54.035
I CAN TELL JUST TELL YOU I'M

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.103
JUST SO FORTUNATE TO BE IN A

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:56.871
COUNTY WITH WE WRE FORTUNATE

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:58.706
ENOUGH TO BE ALL ELECTRONIC AND

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.675

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:06.180
THAT WAS YOU KNOW FOR VARIETY

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:08.049
OF REASONS COULD BE BUDGET AT.

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.917
IN ABILITY TO HIRE THAT

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.053
REQUISITE TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS TO

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.255
BE ABLE TO DO IT AND SO THERE'S

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.657
A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.792
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. WITH IN

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.293
EACH COURT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.729

DEAL WITH YOUR BACK LOADS AT A

CASE ABOUT CLOTHES AND THEN

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:29.137
ONCE WE'VE GATHER DATA AND DO

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:34.976
THE ANALYSIS THEN WE. CAN COME

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:35.643
UP WITH A SOLUTION BUT SOME

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:36.244
TIMES WHEN YOU PUT THE CAR IN

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:38.446
FRONT OF HORSE. AND THE COURT

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:39.847
IS PUSHED THE CART OUT WE DON'T

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.115
GET VERY FAR BUT I. IF WE'RE

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:42.483

LANCE WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.659
THAT. BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:53.528
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.630
CIVIL CASES IN PARTICULAR. SO

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:57.999
WHAT WHAT'S THE TIMELINE. FOR

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.267
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO MAKE A

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:01.769
RECOMMENDATION TO US TO HELP

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:04.405
RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. WE ARE

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:05.540
STILL COLLECTING DATA I BELIEVE

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:06.841
WE JUST COLLECTED ADDITIONAL

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:08.009

OUT TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS-

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.219
SO WE WOULD NEED TO COLLECT

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.620
BECAUSE I CAN AGAIN TELL YOU

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.822
DIFFERENT COURTS HAVE DIFFERENT

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:22.490
TIMELINES FOR HEARING MONTEREY

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:23.825

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:30.798
BECAUSE WE WERE FORTUNATE

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.033

COURT WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:33.094
QUESTION. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.295
CONTINUALLY LOOK DOWN THE ROAD

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:35.596
TO SAY HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.765
WITH THIS AND HOW DO WE SLOWLY

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.234
BUT SURELY. WITHIN STATE HEALTH

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.903
AND SAFETY AND THE CURRENT

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.404
RESTRICTIONS THAT WE DO HAVE

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:45.306
BEGIN TO WIDEN THE PIPELINE

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.475
BEGIN TO OPEN UP AND BEGIN TO

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.877
HEAR MORE AND MORE CASES. WE

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.345
YEAH THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:53.214
WHO ARE TRYING NOT ONLY

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.148
CRIMINAL CASES BUT SEVERAL

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.750
CASES- THERE ARE SOME

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.552
JURISDICTIONS YOU KNOW THAT

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.020
DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES AND

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:00.454

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:06.694
HEARING FROM ALAMEDA. A LITTLE

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:07.295
BIT LATER AND HAVE DONE A VERY

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:09.597
GOOD I- REMOTE. JURY TRIALS SO

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:10.531

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:15.002
YOUNG WHAT WHAT IS THE TIME OF.

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.270
FOR THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.238
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.140
LEGISLATURE TO HELP DEAL WITH

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:20.708
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT ON

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:26.714
CLOUT NINE. AND ON. THAT WILL-

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:28.416
AFFECT ALL OF US. THREE WELL

01:31:28.482 --> 01:31:29.116
WE'RE HOPING THAT IT'S NOT

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.418
GOING TO BE AN ONSLAUGHT AND

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:32.153
WHAT AS JUDGE ANDERSON HAD

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.456
MENTIONED- WE ARE CONTINUALLY

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:38.059
COLLECTING DATA- WHAT WE ARE

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:40.261
DOING AT THIS POINT IN HIS EACH

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.196
STEP TOWARDS RESTORATION FOR

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:44.065
EXAMPLE OF THE BUDGET THE

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.133
PROPOSED RESTORATION OUR BUDGET

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.102
I THINK IS ONE STEP TOWARDS

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:51.038
MOVING FORWARD- FOR US AND I

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.940
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.942
HELPFUL HOW WE'RE IDENTIFYING

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.878
THOSE AREAS WHERE WE

01:31:56.944 --> 01:32:01.415
ANTICIPATE- EIGHT- JOHN IN OUR

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:02.717
CASE LOAD AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.552
BE FOCUSING IN ON SOME OF

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.921
THOSE- THE CHEESE HAS PUT

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:09.357
TOGETHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE-

01:32:09.423 --> 01:32:11.225
EARLY DISPOSITION CALENDARS AND

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.694
SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT A SET OF

01:32:13.761 --> 01:32:17.365
MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS- AND AS WE

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:19.767
DETERMINE- WHAT WE CAN AND DEAL

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:22.203
WITH INTERNALLY- WE WILL WORK

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.372
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:26.374
TO DEFINITELY REACH OUT AT THIS

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.742
POINT IN TERMS OF RESTORATION

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:31.545
OF THE- BUDGET I THINK IS A

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:34.849
VERY STRONG MOVEMENT- TOWARDS-

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:37.852
BEING- NORMALCY- BUT TO BE

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.887
FRANK WELL ONE OF THE BIG

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:42.023
CONSTRAINTS FOR US AGAIN IS

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.991
NEED PHYSICAL DISTANCING

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:46.494
REQUIREMENTS- DUE TO THE

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.497
PANDEMIC AND SO- YOU KNOW THOSE

01:32:49.563 --> 01:32:51.699
ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE YOU

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:53.134
KNOW ARE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.602
BE DEPENDENT UPON THINGS LIKE

01:32:54.669 --> 01:32:56.504
VACCINES AND OTHER- OTHER

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.839
SOLUTIONS BUT- AS WE CONTINUE

01:32:58.906 --> 01:32:59.807
TO LOOK THROUGH THE DATA AS WE

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:00.875
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:02.877
COURTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.512
HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH

YOU AS WELL SO IT IS THE RIGHT

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.949
TIME LINE FOR THE COLLECTION OF

WE DO NOT HAVE A TIMELINE A

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.359
IT'S GO TO BE AN ONGOING BASIS

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:20.394
ONCE WE COLLECT- APPROPRIATE

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.897
DATA AND WERE I'M READY TO HAVE

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:25.433
THE CONVERSATION- I THINK THAT

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:26.434
WHEN WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD

DANGERS ARE CODED TRANSMISSION

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:05.092
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES OF

AFTER EXPOSURE IN THIS CONTEXT.

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:14.635
WE ALSO ROUTINELY HAVE PEOPLE

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:15.736
WHO ARE ALREADY HEALTH

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.181
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN

AND ACCESS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:58.545
WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP

01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:00.514
TO ESTABLISH STATEWIDE SAFETY

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:02.416
GUIDELINES FOR REPORTS. OUR

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:03.417
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN WHEN WE

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:04.718
MEET WITH LOCAL COURTS THE

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.220
LOCAL COURTS ARE OFTEN LOOKING

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:07.621
TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WELL

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:08.956
IT'S NOT THAT'S JUST A COUNCIL

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:10.390
THEY ARE OFTEN DEFERRING TO

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.693
LOCAL COURTS OR THEY DON'T WANT

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.761
TO OVERSTEP THE LEGISLATURE.

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:16.363
THUS THIS IS LEFT LEAD AGAINST

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:17.998
AN ADVOCATES A CORPORATE HOT IN

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:21.401
THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT MATCH OF

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:24.705
OUT I ALSO COMMEND THE

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:27.474
BACKGROUND PAPER AND ALL THAT

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.076
WAS IN IT AS IT JUST CRIED THE

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.277
RULES ESTABLISHED BY LOCAL

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:33.580
PORTS ARE NOT. OUR SYSTEM. IN

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:36.250
OUR EXPERIENCE THE IS LOCKED

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:38.819
BIG WHITE STANDARDS HASN'T MET.

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.654
MENTION CREATE INCONSISTENCIES

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.322
AND DISPARITIES INCREASED

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:44.491
HEALTH RISKS AND INCREASED CORE

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:47.461

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:49.263
COURTS AND DIGITAL I ALSO HAVE

01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:51.832
BEEN WORKING VERY HARD- AND WE

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.700
UNDERSTAND THERE UNDER RESOURCE

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:54.768
AND THAT THERE ARE LOCAL

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:56.069
CONSTRAINTS INDIANS BUT OUR

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.371
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT LOCAL

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:59.172
COURTS AND JUDGES SEEM TO BE

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:00.240
STARTING FROM SCRATCH

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:02.943
RECREATING AND REACTING RATHER

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:04.478
THAN STARTING FROM MINIMUM

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.346
SAFETY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:08.715

AND NOTICES AND INSTRUCTIONS.

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.557
THE RESULT OF WHAT WE SEE IS

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:17.791
THAT ONE'S ABILITY TO SAFELY

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:19.893
EXERCISE THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS IS

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.229
NOT JUST BY COUNTY BUT LIKE

JUDICIAL OFFICER. EXAMPLE WE

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:26.867
CONTINUE TO SEE A LOT OF

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:28.268
COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT ADOPTED

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.903
CONSISTENT POLICIES FOR ACCESS

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:31.872
REMOTE APPEARANCES AS YOU OF

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:36.343
DISCUSSED. THERE IT MAY BE THAT

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:37.277
WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS TO APPEAR

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:39.046

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.816
DEPEND JUST ON A JUDICIAL

OFFICERS PREFERENCE AN INTEREST

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.520
IN LEARNING THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:47.688
RATHER THAN WHITE RIGHT

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.222
TRAINING AND FACILITATION OF

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:51.525
REMOTE ACCESS. WE DO NOT SEE

CONSISTENT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:56.763
EVEN ACROSS LOCAL COURTS. I'M

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.365
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE

01:43:58.432 --> 01:44:01.969
MINIMUM STANDARDS AND BEST

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:02.502
PRACTICES FOR THINGS LIKE

LANGUAGE ACCESS. WE HAVE WE ARE

01:44:04.938 --> 01:44:06.840
NOT SEEING SIMPLE CLEAR NOTICES

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.041
AND INSTRUCTIONS SO IT IS

01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:11.411
CONFUSING TO KNOW HOW- WHAT

01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:13.113
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AND HOW

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.848
YOU ACCESS THEM. AND THEY ARE

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:16.984

LANGUAGES OUT OTHER THAN

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:20.754
ENGLISH MAKING IT EITHER. FOR

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:22.789
MORE COMPLICATED. FOR LEAD

AGAINST YOU DO NOT SPEAK

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:25.726

REMOTE ACCESS AND FEE WAIVERS

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:34.501
ARE NOT BEING CONSISTENTLY

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:35.802
APPLIED. FOR EXAMPLE FOR A

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:36.903
TELEPHONIC APPEARANCE WITH

DOLLARS PER CALL OR PER CALL

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:42.209
THERE ARE OFTEN MANY STEPS THAT

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:43.310
NEED TO BE TAKEN TO GET THOSE

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.612
FEES WAIVED. FOR THOSE WERE

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:46.913
JUST ABOVE A FEE WAIVER WHICH

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.982
RAISED A FAMILY OF FOUR I JUST

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.784
UNDER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:51.818
THIS COULD BE HUNDREDS OF

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.453
DOLLARS OR FOR JUST A FEW

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.755
HEARINGS WHICH INCLUDE

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:56.289
CONTINUANCE. WHILE OTHER

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:59.059
COMPANIES AND JUST ACROSS THAT

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:02.362
ARTIFICIAL BOUNDARY. YET THERE

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:04.398
ARE NO FEES FOR REMOTE ACCESS.

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:06.066
FURTHER THIS INCONSISTENCY AND

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.467
REMOTE APPEARANCE THIS HAS

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:09.002
MEANT THAT THERE ARE LESS

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:10.604
RESOURCES FOR LEGAL AID IN PRO

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:14.374
BONO AS OFTEN WE ARE ETHICALLY

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:14.908
WE HAVE ATTORNEYS THAT ARE

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.743
ETHICALLY I HAVE TO LIMIT THEIR

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:18.245
SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION AND

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:21.982
ASSISTANCE BECAUSE HER HEALTH

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:22.549
CONCERNS THEY CANNOT GO INTO

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:24.751
COURT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.486
THIS CAN CHANGE AND CHANGE

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:29.523
QUICKLY WE CAN WE SEE AND HOW

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:30.924
MANY IS AND WE WILL HEAR FROM

01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.659
LATER TODAY ALAMEDA COUNTY

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.227
SUPERIOR COURT. THAT HAS

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:35.862
SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED CONSISTENT

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.698
UNIVERSAL VIDEO PARENTS

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.833
TECHNOLOGIES STARTING IN APRIL.

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.668
AND THEY ARE A MODEL FOR BEST

01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:45.138
PRACTICES. AS IN THE- ALSO AS

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:45.806
WELL AS DETAILED IN THE

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:48.275
BACKGROUND PAPER. ALL MAJORITY

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:49.710
OF COUNTIES HAVE DONE SOME A

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:51.445
REMOTE APPEARANCES FIFTY

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:53.146
COUNTIES HAVE SOME LEVEL OF

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:55.115
REMOTE ACCESS AND THIRTY EIGHT

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.650
HAVE SOME WITHIN EACH. CASE

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.318
TYPE SO THERE IS ALREADY

01:45:58.385 --> 01:45:59.619
GROUNDWORK THAT HAS BEEN

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:00.721
ESTABLISHED FOR THE

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:02.923
AVAILABILITY STATEWIDE AND THAT

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.357
IS CRITICAL WE NEED THAT

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:08.462
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE.

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:10.530
IN CONCLUSION I JUST I WANT TO

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.099
AGAIN RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.234
THAT HAS BEEN DONE BUT WE ARE

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.035
STILL VERY MUCH IN THE MIDST OF

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.237
THIS. MATCH AND THERE IS GREAT

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:20.073
URGENCY AND NEED TO ACT NOW. I

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.908
UNDERSTAND WE THE WE HAVE YEARS

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:24.077
TO COME BUT AGAIN WE NEED THE

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.645
LEGISLATURE TO HELP ESTABLISH

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:27.280
STATEWIDE COURTS SAFETY

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:29.583
GUIDELINES THAT A LONG.

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:31.451
ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA CODE

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:33.520
GUIDELINES SUCH OF OUR HOLDERS

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:35.322
TIERED SYSTEM THAT IS WELL

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.491
KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD IT. AND TO

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.326
HELP SET SAFETY GUIDELINES THAT

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:40.494
ARE LED BY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.529
EXPERTS. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.898
PRIORITIZE EXPANSION OF REMOTE

01:46:44.965 --> 01:46:47.134
ACCESS AND HAVE A COMMITMENT TO

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.569
CONSISTENCY AND FULL EQUAL. AND

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:53.840
ACCESS. FOR ALL LITIGANTS

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:54.775
ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS WILL

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:56.610
RICK. A COMMITMENT FOR ADEQUATE

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:58.445
FUNDING WHICH I'M HEARING LOUD

01:46:58.512 --> 01:47:00.580
AND CLEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

01:47:00.647 --> 01:47:03.116
I THINK THIS TIMELINE IS URGENT

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:04.518
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:06.186
FINANCIAL BARRIERS ARE NOT IN

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.321
THE WAY OF SAFETY AND ACCESS.

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:10.257
IT WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT IN

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.392
DISASTER RELIEF DOES NOT DIVERT

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:14.661
FROM OTHER VITAL SERVICES. AND

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.596
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:17.597
THE LESSONS WE HAVE LEARNED

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:19.533
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC TO ADDRESS

01:47:19.599 --> 01:47:21.802
LONGSTANDING STRUCTURAL

01:47:21.868 --> 01:47:24.104

AN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT

02:55:48.337 --> 02:55:49.739
QUESTION ALTHOUGH I THINK IT

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.107
MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON

02:55:51.173 --> 02:55:51.841
THE COURT EXPERIENCE THIS IS

02:55:51.908 --> 02:55:53.509
NANCY EVERHART AGAIN NUMBER

02:55:53.576 --> 02:55:55.611
NINETY NOW- YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:55:55.678 --> 02:55:58.114
LEARNED A LOT SINCE MARCH WHEN

02:55:58.180 --> 02:55:59.282
WE WHEN WE HAVE TO REDUCE

02:55:59.348 --> 02:56:01.050
SERVICES AND- WE'VE LEARNED

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:02.818
WHERE TO GET MASS AND HOW TO

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:04.820
WEAR MASKS AND HOW DO. HOW TO

02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:07.256
APPLY SIGNAGE AND OTHER SOCIAL

02:56:07.323 --> 02:56:08.824
DISTANCE I THINK SOME OF THE

02:56:08.891 --> 02:56:10.626
BARRIERS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

02:56:10.693 --> 02:56:11.594
HAVE OUR AROUND SOCIAL

02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:13.562
DISTANCING AND THE INADEQUACY

02:56:13.629 --> 02:56:15.998
OF OUR FACILITIES- YOU KNOW

02:56:16.065 --> 02:56:17.466
WE'VE USE PLEXIGLAS BARRIERS

02:56:17.533 --> 02:56:19.268
WHERE WE CAN'T BUT IN GENERAL

02:56:19.335 --> 02:56:20.636
COURT ROOMS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT

02:56:20.703 --> 02:56:22.238
SO HOW DO WE FIND ALTERNATIVE

02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:23.940
FACILITIES FOR THAT. POLICING

02:56:24.006 --> 02:56:25.541
COSTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE IN A

02:56:25.608 --> 02:56:27.109
TIME WHERE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:29.512
THE BUDGET AVAILABLE- STAFFING

02:56:29.578 --> 02:56:31.714
IS NOT AVAILABLE TO HANDLE

02:56:31.781 --> 02:56:34.417
EXPANDED COURTROOM CASES SO

02:56:34.483 --> 02:56:36.218
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

02:56:36.285 --> 02:56:37.753
IF WE HADN'T NEED BUDGET

02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:39.655
AVAILABLE AND WE HAD STAFFING

02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:42.024
AVAILABLE WE MAY BE ABLE TO

02:56:42.091 --> 02:56:43.859
EXPAND THE SERVICES THAT WE

02:56:43.926 --> 02:56:45.962
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW I DON'T

02:56:46.028 --> 02:56:46.462
KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE

02:56:46.529 --> 02:56:49.231
QUESTION OR NOT BUT- I CAN'T

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:50.700
SAY THAT J. C. SEATED AT. A

02:56:50.766 --> 02:56:52.268
REMARKABLE JOB OF WORKING WITH

02:56:52.335 --> 02:56:53.469
CARILLO WE ASKED TO BE ABLE TO

02:56:53.536 --> 02:56:55.905
PROVIDE PP EQUIPMENT TO THE

02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.006
COURTS AND WERE ABLE TO ORDER

02:56:57.073 --> 02:56:58.507
THAT DIRECTLY NOW WHICH WAS

02:56:58.574 --> 02:56:59.442
SOMETHING WE DIDN'T HAVE IN THE

02:56:59.508 --> 02:57:01.544
BEGINNING AND WE WERE

02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:02.144
SCRAMBLING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE

02:57:02.211 --> 02:57:08.050
TO. OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION.

02:57:08.117 --> 02:57:10.052
ALREADY FOR THAT EQUIPMENT. BUT

02:57:10.119 --> 02:57:11.821
YOU TO SEPARATE AND ELSE CARE

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:14.757
TO. VOLUNTEER NAY. AND THE

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:16.726
QUESTION. THIS IS DELAY JUDGE

02:57:16.792 --> 02:57:18.527
LATE OUT ALL RESPOND FROM

02:57:18.594 --> 02:57:20.529
CENTER CENTER WHY HOUSE GETS

02:57:20.596 --> 02:57:22.832
ITS A GREAT A VERY PRACTICAL

02:57:22.898 --> 02:57:23.733
ONE- AND WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT

02:57:23.799 --> 02:57:25.267
AS MUSEUM ARTS THAT STATED NAY

02:57:25.334 --> 02:57:27.236
DO THINK THAT WHILE EVERY

02:57:27.303 --> 02:57:28.904
COUNTY HAS DEFERRED HEALTHCARE

02:57:28.971 --> 02:57:30.539
AGENCIES IN DIFFERENT STANDARDS

02:57:30.606 --> 02:57:31.707
BECAUSE THE KOBE IT IMPACT IS

02:57:31.774 --> 02:57:33.509
DIFFERENT IN MOST COUNTIES I

02:57:33.576 --> 02:57:34.677
THINK THERE IT'S SAFE TO SAY

02:57:34.744 --> 02:57:36.445
THAT THERE IS A CONSENSUS OF

02:57:36.512 --> 02:57:39.215
SOME KIND ON BASIC. HEALTHCARE

02:57:39.281 --> 02:57:41.083
PRACTICES IT WORLD FOLLOWING IN

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:43.419
THE COURTS- I DO THINK THAT IT

02:57:43.486 --> 02:57:45.021
DOESN'T OF MEDIA AS YOU POINT

02:57:45.087 --> 02:57:47.123
OUT THE SPACE ISSUE I COME FROM

02:57:47.189 --> 02:57:48.257
A COUNTY WE WE'VE BEEN VERY

WE'VE TAKEN OUR LUMPS WHERE

02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:56.065
WE'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN TRIALS

02:57:56.132 --> 02:57:58.000
WHERE JURORS WITNESSES OR

02:57:58.067 --> 02:58:00.102
ATTORNEYS HAVE BE HAVE TESTED

02:58:00.169 --> 02:58:01.470

02:58:01.537 --> 02:58:02.805
RESULTING AS YOU HEARD BEFORE

02:58:02.872 --> 02:58:05.841
MISTRIALS OR CONTINUANCES AND

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:07.443
HAVING TO DO OVER SO IT DOESN'T

02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:09.311
ALLEVIATE THE CHALLENGES SPACE.

02:58:09.378 --> 02:58:10.112
AS YOU PUT IT IT'S VERY

02:58:10.179 --> 02:58:12.214
DIFFICULT IN THE SPACE WE HAVE

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:13.682

02:59:11.574 --> 02:59:13.909
I TAKE A LOOK AT AT THAT THE

02:59:13.976 --> 02:59:16.345

02:59:20.316 --> 02:59:23.519
BY COUNTY AND- AND IT'S GOING

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:24.887
TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

ABLE TO. GET BACK TO. I TO

02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:37.166
NORMAL AND I PUT THAT IN QUOTES.

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:39.201
BECAUSE IF THERE'S EVER A TIME

02:59:39.268 --> 02:59:40.035

OBVIOUSLY AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY

03:10:31.486 --> 03:10:33.555
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. WHICH IS

03:10:33.622 --> 03:10:35.257
WHY WE MOVED TO THE REMOTE

03:10:35.323 --> 03:10:38.994

03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.962

LEARN FROM THESE REMOTE

03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:54.342
EXPERIENCES WELL I DON'T WANT

03:10:54.409 --> 03:10:56.077

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:58.113
THIS HAS BEEN A SMOOTH RIDE

03:10:58.180 --> 03:11:00.215

03:11:00.282 --> 03:11:03.185
BE- WE PIVOTED AT AND-

03:11:03.251 --> 03:11:06.288
SHOCKINGLY RAPID RATE THAT WE

03:11:06.354 --> 03:11:08.456
WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE UNDER ANY

03:11:08.523 --> 03:11:10.492
OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE. WE

03:11:10.559 --> 03:11:12.394
RECOGNIZE THERE ARE THERE ARE

03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:14.095
IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

03:11:14.162 --> 03:11:16.131

03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.076

03:11:58.974 --> 03:12:00.342
SOME OF THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE

03:12:00.408 --> 03:12:02.911
BIT REPETITIVE BECAUSE SO MANY

03:12:02.978 --> 03:12:04.880

03:12:04.946 --> 03:12:07.716

03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:13.508
GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK INTO. AND

03:14:13.575 --> 03:14:16.077
IT IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO VARY

03:14:16.144 --> 03:14:19.180
BY JURISDICTION AND BY RESOURCE

03:14:19.247 --> 03:14:20.382
IT'S NECESSARY THAT WAY. IN

03:14:20.448 --> 03:14:22.350
ALAMEDA COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAD A

03:14:22.417 --> 03:14:25.020
REMOTE MANDATE THAT IS WHAT SET

03:14:25.086 --> 03:14:26.755
UP OUR COST STRUCTURE OR LACK

03:14:26.821 --> 03:14:28.990
THEREOF. SO AT THIS TIME

03:14:29.057 --> 03:14:31.159
BECAUSE OF THAT REMOTE MANDATE

03:14:31.226 --> 03:14:32.894
THE COURT IS SHOULDERING THE

03:14:32.961 --> 03:14:35.330
COST OF THESE REMOTE OPERATIONS

03:14:35.397 --> 03:14:36.765
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE CAN DO

03:14:36.831 --> 03:14:39.067
THAT. SO IN ONE OF THOSE ASKED

03:14:39.134 --> 03:14:40.769
FOR THE FUTURE THAT SOMETHING

03:14:40.835 --> 03:14:42.137
FOR ALL OF US TO KEEP IN MIND

03:14:42.203 --> 03:14:43.738
BECAUSE ALL OF THIS OF COURSE

03:14:43.805 --> 03:14:47.275
COST MONEY. NOW IN TERMS OF

03:14:47.342 --> 03:14:49.310
ADDITIONAL PREFERENCES AS TO

03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:51.446
THESE REMOTE OPERATIONS ONE

03:14:51.513 --> 03:14:53.415
THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

03:14:53.481 --> 03:14:56.084
SOMETIMES IS NOT BROUGHT OUT.

03:14:56.151 --> 03:14:58.787
IS THE COURT EXPERIENCE IN

03:14:58.853 --> 03:15:01.022
PERSON. CAN BE FRIGHTENING. CAN

03:15:01.089 --> 03:15:02.891
BE INTIMIDATING. CAN BE

03:15:02.957 --> 03:15:04.793
AWKWARD. IT IS MOST CERTAINLY

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:07.062
UNFAMILIAR FOR THE MAJORITY OF

03:15:07.128 --> 03:15:11.466
PEOPLE. WHO USE OUR SERVICES.

03:15:11.533 --> 03:15:12.333
THE NICE THING ABOUT A REMOTE

03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:15.270
PLATFORM IS IT TAKES THAT

03:15:15.336 --> 03:15:17.772
UNFAMILIARITY AWAY. THE

03:15:17.839 --> 03:15:19.741
INDIVIDUAL USER CAN REACH OUT

03:15:19.808 --> 03:15:21.476
TO THE COURT CAN PARTICIPATE IN

03:15:21.543 --> 03:15:23.545
THE PROCESS CAN GAIN ACCESS TO

03:15:23.611 --> 03:15:27.048
JUSTICE FROM THE COMFORT OF

03:15:27.115 --> 03:15:29.417
WHERE EVER THEY ARE. AND WE

03:15:29.484 --> 03:15:31.219
HAVE SEEN THAT TAKE PLACE IN A

03:15:31.286 --> 03:15:34.956
WIDE VARIETY OF CONTEXTS.

03:15:35.023 --> 03:15:36.791
THERE'S BEEN TALK TODAY ABOUT

03:15:36.858 --> 03:15:38.093
RESTRAINING ORDER HEARINGS FOR

03:15:38.159 --> 03:15:40.395
EXAMPLE AND THE URGENCY OF

03:15:40.462 --> 03:15:42.464
THOSE COURT PROCEEDINGS AND WE

03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:44.899
ABSOLUTELY AGREE. RESTRAINING

03:15:44.966 --> 03:15:46.901
ORDER HEARINGS UNDERSTANDABLY

03:15:46.968 --> 03:15:48.703
ARE SOME OF THE MOST

03:15:48.770 --> 03:15:49.471
CONTENTIOUS COURT APPEARANCES

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:52.474
THERE ARE. S. ARCH FAMILY COURT

03:15:52.540 --> 03:15:56.578
HEARINGS. IN THESE TWO AREAS IN

03:15:56.644 --> 03:15:58.012
PARTICULAR WE HAVE RECEIVED

03:15:58.079 --> 03:15:59.914
TREMENDOUSLY POSITIVE FEEDBACK

03:15:59.981 --> 03:16:01.749
TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF

03:16:01.816 --> 03:16:03.718
REMOTE APPEARANCES BECAUSE IT

03:16:03.785 --> 03:16:05.753
TAKES DOWN THE TEMPERATURE

03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:09.757
LEVEL. YOU ARE NOT ONLY NOT IN

03:16:09.824 --> 03:16:11.392
AN UNFAMILIAR AREA BUT YOU'RE

03:16:11.459 --> 03:16:12.994
NOT FORCED TO SIT ACROSS THE

03:16:13.061 --> 03:16:16.664
TABLE. FROM SOMEBODY THAT YOU

03:16:16.731 --> 03:16:18.900
ARE IN A VERY ANTAGONISTIC. AND

03:16:18.967 --> 03:16:20.301
POTENTIALLY FRIGHTENING

03:16:20.368 --> 03:16:23.071
RELATIONSHIP WITH. YOUR

03:16:23.138 --> 03:16:24.639
DISTANCED BY THE REMOTE

03:16:24.706 --> 03:16:27.742
TECHNOLOGY IN A POSITIVE WAY

03:16:27.809 --> 03:16:29.844
THE NEW NAVELS MANY PEOPLE TO

03:16:29.911 --> 03:16:31.546
SPEAK MORE FREELY ABOUT WHAT

03:16:31.613 --> 03:16:33.548
HAPPENED TO THEM TO PROVIDE

03:16:33.615 --> 03:16:36.084
TESTIMONY IN A MORE OPEN DIRECT

03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:38.853
WAY THAT ULTIMATELY HELPS THE

03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:41.156
TRIER OF FACT ASSESS THE

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:43.892
VERACITY. AND DETERMINE WHAT'S

03:16:43.958 --> 03:16:45.827
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IN

03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:48.329
ANY PARTICULAR CASE. I THINK

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:51.232
ALSO FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR

03:16:51.299 --> 03:16:53.668
COLLABORATIVE COURTS. WHERE WE

03:16:53.735 --> 03:16:55.570
HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

03:16:55.637 --> 03:16:57.038
DEALING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE

03:16:57.105 --> 03:17:00.008
ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS

03:17:00.074 --> 03:17:03.378
MAY HAVE PTSD. IN MANY OF THOSE

03:17:03.444 --> 03:17:06.281
CIRCUMSTANCES COMING TO COURT

03:17:06.347 --> 03:17:07.815
CAN BE WHAT'S CONSIDERED A

03:17:07.882 --> 03:17:10.618
TRIGGERING EVENT. IT TAKES THE

03:17:10.685 --> 03:17:12.120
INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THEIR

03:17:12.187 --> 03:17:14.556
TREATMENT FACILITY IT TAKES THE

03:17:14.622 --> 03:17:17.258
INDIVIDUAL OUT OF THEIR COMFORT

03:17:17.325 --> 03:17:19.060
SETTING AND PUTS THEM BACK

03:17:19.127 --> 03:17:22.063
POTENTIALLY IN THE SAME KIND OF

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:23.097
TRIGGERING OR TRAUMATIC

03:17:23.164 --> 03:17:26.568
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY SET BACK

03:17:26.634 --> 03:17:28.903
THEIR REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS.

03:17:28.970 --> 03:17:30.104
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR

03:17:30.171 --> 03:17:32.207
COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE'VE BEEN

03:17:32.273 --> 03:17:35.143
ABLE TO REACH THESE PEOPLE. TO

03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:37.378
BRIDGE WHATEVER TECHNOLOGICAL

03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:39.714
GAPS THERE MAY BE AND BRING

03:17:39.781 --> 03:17:41.683
THEM TOGETHER PROVIDING COURT

03:17:41.749 --> 03:17:43.618
SERVICES WHILE STILL ENABLING

03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:46.287
THEM TO MAINTAIN THE CONTINUUM

03:17:46.354 --> 03:17:49.857
OF CARE THAT'S SO NECESSARY FOR

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:52.160
THEIR ON GOING PROGRESS. SO

03:17:52.227 --> 03:17:56.164
THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES.

03:17:56.231 --> 03:17:57.632
ONE OTHER TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

03:17:57.699 --> 03:17:58.633
WE'VE TALKED EARLIER TODAY

03:17:58.700 --> 03:18:00.435
ABOUT THE ACCESS PIECE AND HERE

03:18:00.501 --> 03:18:01.903

EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY THAT

A NUMBER OF SUBJECTS RELATED

03:18:36.571 --> 03:18:38.973
ACTIVITIES IN THE SCHOOLS SEX

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:41.676
IN THE EDUCATION PLATFORM. HOW

THE COURT SYSTEM ABOUT THE

03:18:48.082 --> 03:18:49.717
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ABOUT

03:18:49.784 --> 03:18:51.653
THE JUDICIARY AND COURT

03:18:51.719 --> 03:18:53.755
OPERATIONS TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN

03:18:53.821 --> 03:18:56.524
A LOT. TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN A

03:18:56.591 --> 03:18:59.394
COURTROOM DAY TODAY. WE TALKED

03:18:59.460 --> 03:19:01.329
ALREADY TODAY ABOUT JURY

03:19:01.396 --> 03:19:04.098
SERVICE. AND HOW CHALLENGING IT

03:19:04.165 --> 03:19:07.001
IS FOR JURORS TO COME TO COURT

03:19:07.068 --> 03:19:09.270
A MISTER PANDEMIC. IT'S

03:19:09.337 --> 03:19:10.638
CHALLENGING FOR JURORS TO COME

03:19:10.705 --> 03:19:14.075
TO COURT WITH OUT A PANDEMIC.

03:19:14.142 --> 03:19:15.810
IN A COUNTY LIKE ALAMEDA AS BIG

03:19:15.877 --> 03:19:19.580
AS OURS. IT TAKES TIME. YOU

03:19:19.647 --> 03:19:21.549
HAVE TO DRIVE OR SECURE PUBLIC

03:19:21.616 --> 03:19:24.986
TRANSPORTATION. TRY AND FIND

03:19:25.053 --> 03:19:25.853
CLOSER PARKING WHEN THERE IS

03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:29.357
NONE AND THEN SIT IN A CROWDED

03:19:29.424 --> 03:19:31.492

03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:41.369
WITH OUR REMOTE OPERATIONS

03:19:41.436 --> 03:19:43.171
WHICH HAVE EXTENDED TO JURY

03:19:43.237 --> 03:19:45.773
TRIALS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN

03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:48.476
THE CIVIL CONTEXT WE ACTUALLY

03:19:48.543 --> 03:19:51.245
HAVE A BETTER YOUR RESPONSE

03:19:51.312 --> 03:19:54.082
RATE. WHICH I THINK OF SOME OF

03:19:54.148 --> 03:19:56.351
THE REASONS WHY JURORS CANNOT

03:19:56.417 --> 03:19:58.986
SERVE ON JURIES AND IN ADDITION

03:19:59.053 --> 03:20:00.221
TO DEALING WITH THAT DO YOU

03:20:00.288 --> 03:20:01.556
DISTANCE AND TRANSPORTATION

03:20:01.622 --> 03:20:02.990
ASPECT THERE'S THE TIMING

03:20:03.057 --> 03:20:05.660
PEAKS. IT GOES BACK TO THE

03:20:05.727 --> 03:20:07.662
TAKING TIME OFF WORK. TO

03:20:07.729 --> 03:20:09.230
MISSING NECESSARY MEDICAL

03:20:09.297 --> 03:20:11.332

ESPECIALLY TODAY IN THE TIME OF

DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT WHEN YOU

03:20:20.375 --> 03:20:22.276
HAVE A REMOTE JURY TRIAL. WHEN

03:20:22.343 --> 03:20:24.045
THE INDIVIDUAL JUROR CAN

03:20:24.112 --> 03:20:26.681
PARTICIPATE FROM THEIR OWN

03:20:26.748 --> 03:20:30.918
COMFORTABLE SAFE LOCATION. MANY

03:20:30.985 --> 03:20:31.919
OF THESE IMPEDIMENTS ARE

03:20:31.986 --> 03:20:33.855
REMOVED AND IT IS IN FACT

03:20:33.921 --> 03:20:35.990
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF JURORS

03:20:36.057 --> 03:20:37.792
WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE ON THESE

03:20:37.859 --> 03:20:42.130
PANELS. IN ADDITION WHEN WE

03:20:42.196 --> 03:20:43.398
THINK ABOUT THE ACTUAL EVIDENCE

03:20:43.464 --> 03:20:46.501
PRESENTATION PIECE LET'S GO

03:20:46.567 --> 03:20:47.001
BACK TO THINKING ABOUT A

03:20:47.068 --> 03:20:49.003
TRADITIONAL CORPORATE. WELL WE

03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:50.772
HAVE TWELVE INDIVIDUALS SITTING

OUR BEST TO PRESENT AS WELL AS

03:21:22.603 --> 03:21:25.173

03:22:24.031 --> 03:22:27.635
TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND

03:22:27.702 --> 03:22:32.540
FUNDAMENTALLY. WHEN WE HOW THE

03:22:32.607 --> 03:22:34.876
STABLE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. IT

03:22:34.942 --> 03:22:37.245
HAS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO

03:22:37.311 --> 03:22:40.248
IMPROVE COURT ACCESS. IF WE

03:22:40.314 --> 03:22:42.950
LOOK AT RECENT EXAMPLES OF WHAT

03:22:43.017 --> 03:22:44.452
WE'VE SEEN JUSTIN ALAMEDA

03:22:44.519 --> 03:22:45.953
COUNTY ITSELF WHERE AS I SAID

03:22:46.020 --> 03:22:47.722
WE ARE OFFERING REMOTE

03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:49.590
OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS ALL CASE

03:22:49.657 --> 03:22:53.127
TYPES. THAT MEANS WE HAVE

03:22:53.194 --> 03:22:55.062
ATTORNEYS APPEARING REMOTELY

03:22:55.129 --> 03:22:56.931
LITIGANTS APPEARING REMOTELY

APPEARING REMOTELY. WITNESSES

03:23:01.102 --> 03:23:02.703
APPEARING REMOTELY SUPPORT

PEOPLE APPEARING REMOTELY

03:23:04.539 --> 03:23:06.974
INTERPRETERS CANNOT APPEAR

03:23:07.041 --> 03:23:10.778
REMOTELY. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:23:10.845 --> 03:23:14.482
MEASURES ARE CLEAR. IN TERMS OF

03:23:14.549 --> 03:23:15.983
ACCESS WE'VE TALKED ALREADY

03:23:16.050 --> 03:23:17.351
ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR AN

03:23:17.418 --> 03:23:20.221
INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN HAVING

03:23:20.288 --> 03:23:22.356
TO TAKE A DAY OFF WORK. TO COME

03:23:22.423 --> 03:23:26.360
TESTIFY OR DEFEND THEMSELVES OR

03:23:26.427 --> 03:23:28.095
TAKE A POSITION IN AN IN PERSON

WE'VE HAD EXAMPLES WHERE IN

03:23:37.872 --> 03:23:40.441
CRIMINAL SENTENCE SIX. SOMEBODY

03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:41.876
RECENTLY RELEASED FROM A

03:23:41.943 --> 03:23:43.611
LOCKDOWN FACILITY HAS SECURED A

03:23:43.678 --> 03:23:46.981
NEW JOB. RATHER THAN HAVE TO

03:23:47.048 --> 03:23:48.749
TRY AND TAKE TIME OFF WORK

03:23:48.816 --> 03:23:51.953
DURING THAT PROMOTION. WE HAVE

03:23:52.019 --> 03:23:54.288
THE INDIVIDUALS CALL IT. ON OUR

03:23:54.355 --> 03:23:55.756
ELECTRONIC PLATFORM YOU CAN USE

03:23:55.823 --> 03:23:57.325
IT FROM A MOBILE PHONE OR ANY

03:23:57.391 --> 03:23:59.927
KIND OF SMART DEVICE. CALL IN

03:23:59.994 --> 03:24:01.596
TO COURT AND YOU CAN WITNESS

03:24:01.662 --> 03:24:02.396

CONSTRUCTION UNIFORM. IN THE

03:24:04.832 --> 03:24:06.634
PARKING LOT OF THEIR NEW JOB.

03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:07.668
PARTICIPATING IN THEIR COURT

03:24:07.735 --> 03:24:11.005
PROCEEDING AND ABLE TO RETURN.

03:24:11.072 --> 03:24:12.807
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO THE SAME

03:24:12.873 --> 03:24:15.176
SETTING THAT THEY CAME FROM.

03:24:15.242 --> 03:24:16.777
WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES WHERE WE

03:24:16.844 --> 03:24:18.646
HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL IN A TRAFFIC

03:24:18.713 --> 03:24:20.681
PROCEEDING CHALLENGING THEIR

03:24:20.748 --> 03:24:22.516
INFRACTION OR THEIR TICKET. I

03:24:22.583 --> 03:24:24.085
RECALL ONE WHERE WE HAD

03:24:24.151 --> 03:24:26.087
SOMEBODY WITH A BROKEN ARM. IT

03:24:26.153 --> 03:24:27.455
WAS CLEAR THAT PERSON WAS NOT

03:24:27.521 --> 03:24:28.623
IN A POSITION TO HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:24:28.689 --> 03:24:30.891
TO DRIVE TO COURT BUT RATHER

03:24:30.958 --> 03:24:31.859
THAN HAVE TO CONTINUE THE

03:24:31.926 --> 03:24:34.362
MATTER. THAT PERSON WAS ABLE TO

03:24:34.428 --> 03:24:36.897
PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. WE'VE HAD

03:24:36.964 --> 03:24:39.100
INTERPRETER CASES WITH.

03:24:39.166 --> 03:24:41.168
LANGUAGES THAT ARE LESS COMMON

03:24:41.235 --> 03:24:42.903
OR LESS ACCESSIBLE OR NEED

03:24:42.970 --> 03:24:45.172
RELAY INTERPRETERS AND WE'VE

03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:47.408
BEEN ABLE TO LINK THAT WORKS

03:24:47.475 --> 03:24:49.644
THROUGH REMOTE TECHNOLOGY.

03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:51.445
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE

03:24:51.512 --> 03:24:53.547
THE ADULT CARE PROVIDERS WHO

03:24:53.614 --> 03:24:56.851
ARE REQUIRED TO BE AT HOME OR

03:24:56.917 --> 03:24:58.819
AT A WORKPLACE WITH THEIR

03:24:58.886 --> 03:25:03.591
DEPENDENT. AND IN TERMS OF THE

03:25:03.658 --> 03:25:05.760
TECHNOLOGICAL GAP. THERE

03:25:05.826 --> 03:25:09.196
CERTAINLY ARE SOME BUT BY WAY

03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:11.132
OF EXAMPLE IN THE SECOND REMOTE

03:25:11.198 --> 03:25:12.266
JURY TRIAL THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY

03:25:12.333 --> 03:25:15.436
ENGAGED. WE CALLED IT WAS A

03:25:15.503 --> 03:25:17.705
PREFERENCE CASE WE CALLED IN

03:25:17.772 --> 03:25:20.307
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FORTY

03:25:20.374 --> 03:25:20.808
FIVE JURORS OVER SEVERAL

03:25:20.875 --> 03:25:23.778
SESSIONS. THEY WERE ALL GIVEN A

03:25:23.844 --> 03:25:25.746
QUESTIONNAIRE. AND BECAUSE WE

03:25:25.813 --> 03:25:27.348
KNEW THIS TRIAL WAS GOING TO BE

03:25:27.415 --> 03:25:29.283
CONDUCTED REMOTELY. WE MADE

03:25:29.350 --> 03:25:31.052
SURE THAT THE INITIAL QUESTIONS

03:25:31.118 --> 03:25:33.854
INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT WOULD

03:25:33.921 --> 03:25:35.523
YOU BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE

03:25:35.589 --> 03:25:37.591
IN A JURY TRIAL REMOTELY. AND

03:25:37.658 --> 03:25:39.694
DO YOU HAVE STABLE SECURE OR

03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:41.395
TECHNOLOGICAL ACCESS TO BE ABLE

03:25:41.462 --> 03:25:44.532
TO DO SO. ALL OF THAT

03:25:44.598 --> 03:25:46.967
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

03:25:47.034 --> 03:25:47.568
FORTY FIVE JURORS THAT WERE

03:25:47.635 --> 03:25:50.604
CALLED IN. MY RECOLLECTION IS

03:25:50.671 --> 03:25:52.840
THAT THERE WERE ABOUT SIX. WHO

03:25:52.907 --> 03:25:55.009
SAID THEY DID NOT WANT TO

03:25:55.076 --> 03:25:56.177
PARTICIPATE NO REMOTE JURY

03:25:56.243 --> 03:25:58.446
TRIAL OR DID NOT HAVE TO

03:25:58.512 --> 03:26:00.448
TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY TO

03:26:00.514 --> 03:26:03.384
ENABLE THEM TO DO SO. THAT'S

03:26:03.451 --> 03:26:05.119
TREMENDOUS IN TERMS OF THE

03:26:05.186 --> 03:26:08.422
SHOWER. I CAN GIVE ANOTHER

03:26:08.489 --> 03:26:09.423
EXAMPLE THAT GOES TO THE

03:26:09.490 --> 03:26:10.958
QUESTION I ASKED EARLIER ABOUT

03:26:11.025 --> 03:26:13.027
A FUTURE ASK. WE'VE HAD

03:26:13.094 --> 03:26:15.029
SITUATIONS WHERE ATTORNEYS AND

03:26:15.096 --> 03:26:16.230
ALBEIT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A

03:26:16.297 --> 03:26:18.265
WELL RESOURCE CASE BUT WE'VE

03:26:18.332 --> 03:26:19.900
HAD ATTORNEYS IN WELL RESTORES

03:26:19.967 --> 03:26:23.471
CASES PROVIDE CLEAN TABLETS. TO

03:26:23.537 --> 03:26:24.205
ALL OF THIS WERE JURORS IN

03:26:24.271 --> 03:26:26.774
THEIR CASES TO ENSURE THAT ALL

03:26:26.841 --> 03:26:28.442
JURORS HAD THE EXACT SAME.

03:26:28.509 --> 03:26:30.878
TECHNOLOGICAL PLATFORM IN ORDER

03:26:30.945 --> 03:26:32.413
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SAME

03:26:32.480 --> 03:26:35.549
ACCESS TO THE COURT PROCEEDINGS.

03:26:35.616 --> 03:26:37.318
SCHNAPF IS THERE ARE NO

03:26:37.384 --> 03:26:40.187
GUARANTEES. BUT THESE ARE SOME

03:26:40.254 --> 03:26:42.223
EXAMPLES OF THE STEPS THAT CAN

03:26:42.289 --> 03:26:44.492
BE TAKEN TO BALLOTS THAT

03:26:44.558 --> 03:26:47.294
TREMENDOUS NEEDS TO PROTECT THE

03:26:47.361 --> 03:26:49.797
HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL COURT

03:26:49.864 --> 03:26:54.468
USERS ALL COURT MEMBERS. YES

03:26:54.535 --> 03:26:58.439
GUARANTEED ACCESS TO JUSTICE.

03:26:58.506 --> 03:27:00.841
AND BY WORKING TOGETHER WE CAN

03:27:00.908 --> 03:27:03.778
ACHIEVE THAT. SO TO THE

03:27:03.844 --> 03:27:05.412
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WE ENVISION

03:27:05.479 --> 03:27:07.982
GOING FORWARD WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:27:08.048 --> 03:27:10.217
CONTINUE REMOTE ACCESS WELL AS

03:27:10.284 --> 03:27:11.652
I SAID THERE HAVE BEEN BUMPS

03:27:11.719 --> 03:27:12.787
THERE HAVE BEEN GLITCHES THERE

03:27:12.853 --> 03:27:14.822
ARE PLENTY OF THINGS. THAT WE

03:27:14.889 --> 03:27:18.559
CAN IMPROVE UPON. THE

03:27:18.626 --> 03:27:21.195
OVERWHELMING RESPONSE. HAS BEEN

03:27:21.262 --> 03:27:25.833
SO POSITIVE AND THE ONLY WAY TO

03:27:25.900 --> 03:27:27.802
REALLY BALANCE THOSE TWO ISSUES

03:27:27.868 --> 03:27:29.603
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ACCESS

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:31.372
APPEARS TO BE THROUGH THESE

03:27:31.438 --> 03:27:33.707
REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES WE JUST

03:27:33.774 --> 03:27:35.342
NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO

03:27:35.409 --> 03:27:37.912
THE SAME LEVEL TO GUARANTEE ITS

03:27:37.978 --> 03:27:39.146
UNIVERSALIST CRAWL ACROSS THE

03:27:39.213 --> 03:27:40.815
BOARD TO THE GREATEST EXTENT

03:27:40.881 --> 03:27:43.784
POSSIBLE. SO TO THE QUESTION AS

03:27:43.851 --> 03:27:46.620
TO HOW DO WE DO THAT. ALL BREAK

03:27:46.687 --> 03:27:49.089
IT DOWN INTO TWO AREAS. NUMBER

03:27:49.156 --> 03:27:53.828
ONE STAFF. WE NEED STAFF I

03:27:53.894 --> 03:27:57.698
CAN'T SAY THAT OFTEN UNTOUCHED.

03:27:57.765 --> 03:27:59.200
AS MISS AMBER HEARD ALREADY

03:27:59.266 --> 03:28:00.935
SAID THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE

03:28:01.001 --> 03:28:03.637
THEY ARE WORKING NONSTOP THEY

03:28:03.704 --> 03:28:06.607
ARE STRESSED THEY ARE STRAIGHT

03:28:06.674 --> 03:28:08.709
NO ONE IN THE COURT HAS TAKEN A

03:28:08.776 --> 03:28:13.681
BREAK SINCE MARCH OF. TWENTY

03:28:13.747 --> 03:28:14.882
TWENTY. USING L. A. COUNTY AS

03:28:14.949 --> 03:28:16.817
AN EXAMPLE. IN TERMS OF OUR

03:28:16.884 --> 03:28:22.423
BUDGET. OUR STAFF OVER 80% OF

03:28:22.489 --> 03:28:25.860
OUR BUDGET. THIS IS WHAT TIES

03:28:25.926 --> 03:28:28.162
DIRECTLY TO OUR BACKLOG. WITH

03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:29.730
THE BUDGET CUTS THAT WE HAVE

03:28:29.797 --> 03:28:31.498
BEEN EXPERIENCE DURING THIS

03:28:31.565 --> 03:28:33.200
FISCAL YEAR THE NINETEEN TWENTY

03:28:33.267 --> 03:28:36.470
FISCAL YEAR. WE'VE HAD TO

03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:38.906
IMPOSE FOR LOS. WE'VE HAD TO

03:28:38.973 --> 03:28:42.343
IMPOSE HIRING FREEZE. WE'VE HAD

03:28:42.409 --> 03:28:44.411
VOLUNTARY TIME OFF PROGRAMS WE

03:28:44.478 --> 03:28:46.180
HAVE ALL KINDS OF BUDGET

03:28:46.247 --> 03:28:48.649
REDUCTIONS TO TRY AND KEEP THE

03:28:48.716 --> 03:28:53.454
SHIP MOVING WITH OUT A CLOSURE.

03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:57.458
THE LACK OF STAFF LEADS TO AN

03:28:57.524 --> 03:29:01.395
INCREASE IN BACKLOG. LAST YEAR

03:29:01.462 --> 03:29:05.799
OVER 41% OF OUR EMPLOYEES TOOK

03:29:05.866 --> 03:29:11.705
SOME KIND OF FORMAL LEACH. ON

03:29:11.772 --> 03:29:13.240
TOP OF THAT WE HAVE BEEN

03:29:13.307 --> 03:29:16.911
CARRYING A 10% VACANCY RATE AT

03:29:16.977 --> 03:29:19.346
LEAST. THAT TELLS YOU WHERE WE

03:29:19.413 --> 03:29:23.150
ARE. THAT'S AS MUCH AS A 50%

03:29:23.217 --> 03:29:25.386
REDUCTION AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN

03:29:25.452 --> 03:29:26.453
TIME NOW I'M NOT SAYING IT'S

03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:29.123
THAT WAY EVERY DAY BUT SUFFICE

03:29:29.189 --> 03:29:31.625
TO SAY THE NUMBERS ARE SHOCKING.

03:29:31.692 --> 03:29:32.259
AND THAT'S WHERE THE BACKGROUND

03:29:32.326 --> 03:29:35.496
HAPPENS. WHEN WE TOOK OUR

03:29:35.562 --> 03:29:37.164
VOLUNTARY TIME OFF PROGRAM OVER

03:29:37.231 --> 03:29:38.832
THE HOLIDAYS AS A COST SAVING

03:29:38.899 --> 03:29:41.368
MEASURE. BECAUSE IT WAS THE

03:29:41.435 --> 03:29:42.903
HOLIDAYS AND WE ALREADY KNEW WE

03:29:42.970 --> 03:29:45.439
HAD REDUCE COURT OPERATIONS WE

03:29:45.506 --> 03:29:47.374
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT TIME TO

03:29:47.441 --> 03:29:49.310
REDEPLOY THE STAFF THAT WE HAD

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:51.512
WORKING TO FOCUS DIRECTLY ON

03:29:51.578 --> 03:29:54.214
THE BACK LOCK. AND WE MADE A

03:29:54.281 --> 03:29:56.884
SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT TO REDUCE

03:29:56.951 --> 03:29:59.019
OUR FILING DELAYS JUST IN A TWO

03:29:59.086 --> 03:30:01.922
WEEK PERIOD. WHEN WE HAVE THE

03:30:01.989 --> 03:30:04.725
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE HIRE STAFF

03:30:04.792 --> 03:30:06.827
ON A FULL TIME BASIS WE CAN

03:30:06.894 --> 03:30:07.995
DEVELOP THAT STAFF TO THE

03:30:08.062 --> 03:30:09.797
BACKLOG WE CAN DEVOTE THAT

03:30:09.863 --> 03:30:12.032
STAFF TO CASE PROCESSING WE CAN

03:30:12.099 --> 03:30:13.801
DEVOTE THAT STAFF TO REMOTE

03:30:13.867 --> 03:30:17.104
JURY SELECTION SO THAT WE CAN

03:30:17.171 --> 03:30:19.807
GET MORE TRIALS OUT. BUT WE

03:30:19.873 --> 03:30:21.875
CAN'T DO IT WITH THIS HUGE

03:30:21.942 --> 03:30:24.178
WITHOUT THIS HUGE STAFF HE'S

03:30:24.244 --> 03:30:26.780
SATISFIED. AND THEN OF COURSE

03:30:26.847 --> 03:30:27.848
THERE'S THE SECOND PIECE WHICH

03:30:27.915 --> 03:30:29.249
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT NOT

03:30:29.316 --> 03:30:31.986
THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. ALL

03:30:32.052 --> 03:30:33.420
COURTS AND THIS IS WHERE

03:30:33.487 --> 03:30:35.289
THERE'S THE DISPARITY IN THE

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:37.958
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTS. WE ALL ARE

03:30:38.025 --> 03:30:40.327
IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS WE ALL

03:30:40.394 --> 03:30:41.595
HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

03:30:41.662 --> 03:30:43.764
BANDWIDTH WEALL HAVE DIFFERENT

SOME THOUGHTS I WANT TO SHARE

03:34:45.239 --> 03:34:46.607
WITH YOU BEFORE I DO THAT I

03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:48.275
WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS

03:34:48.342 --> 03:34:49.009
ON THE PRESENTATION I JUST

03:34:49.076 --> 03:34:51.178
HEARD- BY THE HONORABLE JUDGE

03:34:51.245 --> 03:34:53.046
FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH I

03:34:53.113 --> 03:34:53.714
THOUGHT WAS ABSOLUTELY

03:34:53.780 --> 03:34:56.049
FABULOUS- AND TO ME IS REALLY

03:34:56.116 --> 03:34:58.619
MODEL. FOR WHAT SHOULD BE

03:34:58.685 --> 03:35:00.520
HAPPENING ACROSS OUR STATE WHEN

03:35:00.587 --> 03:35:02.322
I HEARD HER SAY WAS THAT

03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:04.391
IMMEDIATELY THE COURT FOCUSED

03:35:04.458 --> 03:35:05.826
ON WHAT I WHAT I THINK ARE THE

03:35:05.892 --> 03:35:06.860
TWO PILLARS THAT SHOULD BE

03:35:06.927 --> 03:35:09.096
DRIVING. OUR CONVERSATION OUR

03:35:09.162 --> 03:35:10.731
DECISIONS IN THIS AREA THE TWO

03:35:10.797 --> 03:35:12.633
COLORS IN MY MIND OR SAFETY AND

03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:14.635
ACCESS TO JUSTICE I WANT HER

03:35:14.701 --> 03:35:16.670
THE JUDGE SAYING IS THAT FIRST

03:35:16.737 --> 03:35:17.604
THEY MADE SURE THEY WERE BEING

03:35:17.671 --> 03:35:19.473
SAFE. AND FOR THAT WHAT THAT

03:35:19.539 --> 03:35:21.108
MEANT IS THEY NEED TO BE REMOTE

03:35:21.174 --> 03:35:22.542
AND SO THEY MANDATED REMOTE

03:35:22.609 --> 03:35:24.778
ACCESS AND THEN THEY SPENT THE

03:35:24.845 --> 03:35:27.381
LAST ELEVEN MONTHS FIGURING OUT

03:35:27.447 --> 03:35:28.982
HOW TO DO THAT AS EFFECTIVELY

03:35:29.049 --> 03:35:35.422
AS POSSIBLE. AND I WOULD NOTE.

03:35:35.489 --> 03:35:36.023
THAT WELL IN SOME INSTANCES.

03:35:36.089 --> 03:35:37.324
SAY AN AXE. CAN SIT INCOME

03:35:37.391 --> 03:35:38.525
DURING. WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE

03:35:38.592 --> 03:35:40.127
ARE LOTS OF INSTANCES WHERE

03:35:40.193 --> 03:35:42.229
THEY CAN ACTUALLY REINFORCE.

03:35:42.296 --> 03:35:43.363
ONE ANOTHER I THINK YOU HEARD

03:35:43.430 --> 03:35:44.498
THAT IN THE PRESENTATION JUST

03:35:44.564 --> 03:35:45.999
READ ABOUT ALL MEDIA. IS THERE

03:35:46.066 --> 03:35:47.267
ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE

03:35:47.334 --> 03:35:48.368
AROUND ACCESS THAT MAKE

03:35:48.435 --> 03:35:50.103
EVERYBODY SAFER AND THINGS CAN

03:35:50.170 --> 03:35:51.338
BE BLOWN AROUND SAFETY THAT

03:35:51.405 --> 03:35:53.006
IMPROVE ACCESS AS WELL. SO

03:35:53.073 --> 03:35:54.474
THESE AREN'T ALWAYS CONFLICTING

03:35:54.541 --> 03:35:55.776
IDEAS AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY

03:35:55.842 --> 03:35:57.778
ESSENTIAL. THAT AT THE END OF

03:35:57.844 --> 03:35:58.845
THE DAY OUR COURT ROOMS ARE

03:35:58.912 --> 03:36:01.581
SAFE. AND THAT WE MAXIMIZE.

03:36:01.648 --> 03:36:03.717
ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC TO OUR

03:36:03.784 --> 03:36:06.953
JUDICIARY SYSTEM- SO I HAVE

03:36:07.020 --> 03:36:08.689
THREE POINTS THAT I WANT TO-

03:36:08.755 --> 03:36:10.157
AND INTERESTING OF THE FACT

03:36:10.223 --> 03:36:10.991
THAT THAT AS YOU JUST

03:36:11.058 --> 03:36:12.993
MENTIONED- WE ARE WE ARE

03:36:13.060 --> 03:36:13.827
RUNNING A BIT LATE THAT I WILL

03:36:13.894 --> 03:36:15.395
QUICKLY RUN THROUGH THAT I WANT

03:36:15.462 --> 03:36:17.898
TO SHARE. THE FIRST IS THAT WE

03:36:17.964 --> 03:36:20.367
CONTINUE TO HAVE UNSAFE

03:36:20.434 --> 03:36:22.169
PROCEEDINGS IN MANY OF OUR

03:36:22.235 --> 03:36:24.338
COURT ROOMS ACROSS THE STATE- I

03:36:24.404 --> 03:36:25.572
THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE

03:36:25.639 --> 03:36:27.541
ALAMEDA MODEL ALAMEDA MODEL YOU

03:36:27.607 --> 03:36:29.609
JUST HEARD ABOUT. IS THAT IT.

03:36:29.676 --> 03:36:30.744
FOR MOSTLY CANCER MANY

03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:32.079
LITIGANTS IN THE STATE THEY

03:36:32.145 --> 03:36:33.847
DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THOSE

03:36:33.914 --> 03:36:35.649
BENEFITS. IN MANY INSTANCES

03:36:35.716 --> 03:36:37.084
ACROSS THE BAY DOWN HERE IN LOS

03:36:37.150 --> 03:36:39.219
ANGELES PEOPLE ARE STILL HAVING

03:36:39.286 --> 03:36:41.054
TO GO INTO COURT. IN VERY

03:36:41.121 --> 03:36:43.390
UNSAFE SITUATIONS I WANT TO

03:36:43.457 --> 03:36:45.125
EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS NOT JUST

03:36:45.192 --> 03:36:46.493
THOSE SITUATIONS THAT WE HEARD

03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:47.761
ABOUT FROM THE CHIEF JUSTICE.

03:36:47.828 --> 03:36:48.995
WHICH ARE CERTAINLY SOME OF THE

03:36:49.062 --> 03:36:49.830
SITUATIONS WHERE THIS IS

03:36:49.896 --> 03:36:51.398
HAPPENING ISSUES WITH IT SHE

03:36:51.465 --> 03:36:52.499
RACED AROUND THE PEOPLE'S

03:36:52.566 --> 03:36:54.000
LIBERTY IS AT STAKE OR THERE'S

03:36:54.067 --> 03:36:55.869
A FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH OR SAFETY

03:36:55.936 --> 03:36:56.737
ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:36:56.803 --> 03:36:58.372
ADDRESSED IN PERSON. BUT WHAT

03:36:58.438 --> 03:37:00.207
WE ARE SEEING A LOS ANGELES. WE

03:37:00.273 --> 03:37:03.677
ALSO HAVE. ROUTINE I TRAFFIC

03:37:03.744 --> 03:37:06.046
MATTERS BEING HEARD IN PERSON

03:37:06.113 --> 03:37:07.347
SO WE HAVE A CLIENT WHO CANNOT

03:37:07.414 --> 03:37:09.783
AFFORD TO PAY THE FINE RELATED

03:37:09.850 --> 03:37:10.984
OR CRACKED WINDSHIELD THEIR

03:37:11.051 --> 03:37:13.653
ONLY OPTION. IS TO SHOW UP AT A

03:37:13.720 --> 03:37:15.021
CROWDED WAREHOUSE AND GO INTO A

03:37:15.088 --> 03:37:17.290
CROWDED COURTROOM. AND DEAL IN

03:37:17.357 --> 03:37:18.625
WHAT I BELIEVE IS A VERY UNSAFE

03:37:18.692 --> 03:37:21.495
WAY WITHOUT CITATION. CENTRALLY

03:37:21.561 --> 03:37:23.830
IN OUR VISION MATTERS- AND

03:37:23.897 --> 03:37:25.132
THESE ARE DONE IN LOS ANGELES

03:37:25.198 --> 03:37:26.233
ON A JUDGE BY JUDGE

03:37:26.299 --> 03:37:28.368
DETERMINATION EACH JUDGE HAS

03:37:28.435 --> 03:37:30.070
THE AUTHORITY TO THE SIDE. TO

03:37:30.137 --> 03:37:31.471
WHAT DEGREE SOMEONE FACING

03:37:31.538 --> 03:37:37.477
EVICTION. FROM THEIR HOME AND

03:37:37.544 --> 03:37:37.978
THEIR LAWYER IF THEY'RE

03:37:38.044 --> 03:37:38.645
REPRESENTED. SHOULDN'T REQUIRED

03:37:38.712 --> 03:37:39.679
TO COME INTO. IN WITH THEIR

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:40.280
ANTICS MATTER IF THEY BELIEVE

03:37:40.347 --> 03:37:40.914
THEY HAVE A- AND THE RIGHT TO

03:37:40.981 --> 03:37:42.649
STAY IN HOME OR WHAT DEGREE

03:37:42.716 --> 03:37:44.684
THEY CAN DO THAT REMOTELY- I

03:37:44.751 --> 03:37:46.052
WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT

03:37:46.119 --> 03:37:47.654
KNOW THAT THESE AREAS WHERE WE

03:37:47.721 --> 03:37:50.424
SEE THE- RATE. THE GREATEST

03:37:50.490 --> 03:37:52.125
CONTINUATION OF IN PERSON

03:37:52.192 --> 03:37:53.894
PROCEEDINGS OR WHATEVER WE SEE

03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:55.829
LOW INCOME LITIGANTS AND MOSTLY

03:37:55.896 --> 03:37:57.330
BLACK AND BROWN THAT AGAINST IN

03:37:57.397 --> 03:37:59.199
OUR COURT ROOMS- THAT'S MY

03:37:59.266 --> 03:38:00.267
FIRST POINT IS THAT THIS

03:38:00.333 --> 03:38:01.268
CONTINUES TO GO ON AND

03:38:01.334 --> 03:38:03.236
CONTINUES TO GO ON AREAS. THAT

03:38:03.303 --> 03:38:04.638
ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNSAFE AND

03:38:04.704 --> 03:38:06.606
THAT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL URGE.

03:38:06.673 --> 03:38:10.710
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE

03:38:10.777 --> 03:38:11.311
IS THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT

03:38:11.378 --> 03:38:13.046
LEAST. BUT STILL HAPPY IS IN

03:38:13.113 --> 03:38:14.347
SAY THE IDEA THAT WE ARE

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:16.383
CONTINUING TO CONDUCT IN PERSON

03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:18.718
PROCEEDINGS. IN NONESSENTIAL

03:38:18.785 --> 03:38:20.887
MATTERS. WHEN WE'RE IN THE

03:38:20.954 --> 03:38:22.856
MIDST OF THE WORST. PUBLIC

03:38:22.923 --> 03:38:24.391
HEALTH CRISIS THAT OUR COUNTRY

03:38:24.458 --> 03:38:25.792
HAS SEEN IN OVER A HUNDRED

03:38:25.859 --> 03:38:28.028
YEARS. MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. I

03:38:28.094 --> 03:38:29.529
DON'T BELIEVE WHY WE ARE

03:38:29.596 --> 03:38:31.398
CONTINUING TO SEE THAT. AS YOU

03:38:31.465 --> 03:38:32.132
CAN TELL FROM THE TESTIMONY

03:38:32.199 --> 03:38:34.234
TODAY IS ROOTED IN OUR

03:38:34.301 --> 03:38:36.303
DECENTRALIZATION OF HOW WE ARE

03:38:36.369 --> 03:38:37.604
MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW

03:38:37.671 --> 03:38:39.372
OUR COURTS ARE OPERATING. SO WE

03:38:39.439 --> 03:38:41.741
HAVE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE

03:38:41.808 --> 03:38:42.609
FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY

03:38:42.676 --> 03:38:44.277
COURTS ON MAKING THE DECISIONS

03:38:44.344 --> 03:38:45.679
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR

03:38:45.745 --> 03:38:47.814
COUNTY. AND WHAT'S OPEN AND

03:38:47.881 --> 03:38:48.949
WHAT'S CLOSED AND WHAT THE

03:38:49.015 --> 03:38:50.984
REMOTE PROCEDURES ARE I'M NOT

03:38:51.051 --> 03:38:52.452
EVEN ALWAYS ON FIFTY EIGHT

03:38:52.519 --> 03:38:54.287
LEVELS WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL.

03:38:54.354 --> 03:38:56.056
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THOSE COURTS

03:38:56.122 --> 03:38:57.624
ARE MAKING DIFFERENT DECISIONS

03:38:57.691 --> 03:38:58.925
AND IN MANY INSTANCES FOR

03:38:58.992 --> 03:38:59.893
EXAMPLE AS I JUST MENTIONED

03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:01.027
INDIVIDUAL COURTS WE ACTUALLY.

03:39:01.094 --> 03:39:02.529
INDIVIDUAL JUDGES HUNDREDS OF

03:39:02.596 --> 03:39:03.597
DIFFERENT JUDGES ACROSS OUR

03:39:03.663 --> 03:39:05.232
STATE MAKING THESE DECISIONS

03:39:05.298 --> 03:39:06.766
ABOUT WHAT IS SAFE AND WHAT IS

03:39:06.833 --> 03:39:08.702
NOT SAFE. I BELIEVE THAT THE

03:39:08.768 --> 03:39:10.637
CHAOS THAT WE ARE SEEING AND

03:39:10.704 --> 03:39:12.572
EXPERIENCING. I DON'T USE THAT

03:39:12.639 --> 03:39:13.740
WORD LIGHTLY I REALLY THINK IN

03:39:13.807 --> 03:39:18.144
MANY. CASES IT IS CHAOTIC. WHAT

03:39:18.211 --> 03:39:19.246
WE ARE SEEING IS BECAUSE- BY

03:39:19.312 --> 03:39:20.814
DECENT. AND THAT D. CENTRAL. IS

03:39:20.881 --> 03:39:22.983
JEOPARDIZING BOTH SAFETY AND

03:39:23.049 --> 03:39:24.818
ACCESS TO JUSTICE I THINK IT'S

03:39:24.885 --> 03:39:26.186
VERY TELLING THAT YOU HAVE NOT

03:39:26.253 --> 03:39:27.888
HER. IN THE BACK OF A SECOND

03:39:27.954 --> 03:39:30.323
YOU HAVE FOR LOTS OF VERY

03:39:30.390 --> 03:39:32.859
CREATIVE. VERY HARDWORKING

03:39:32.926 --> 03:39:34.628
REPORTS FROM THE COURTS ABOUT

03:39:34.694 --> 03:39:36.396
THINGS THEY HAVE DONE TO TRY TO

03:39:36.463 --> 03:39:37.631
DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC I WANT

03:39:37.697 --> 03:39:38.932
TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THESE ARE

03:39:38.999 --> 03:39:41.201
TOUGH ISSUES AND EVEN THOUGH I

03:39:41.268 --> 03:39:42.602
AM. SO VERY STRONGLY ABOUT

03:39:42.669 --> 03:39:43.837
THESE THINGS I RECOGNIZE THEY

03:39:43.904 --> 03:39:45.372
ARE COMPLICATED I RECOGNIZE

03:39:45.438 --> 03:39:46.840
THERE'S LOTS IN THE WEST. BUT

03:39:46.907 --> 03:39:48.108
IN THE END OF THE DAY WHAT YOU

03:39:48.174 --> 03:39:49.309
HEARD FROM THE COURTS FOR THE

03:39:49.376 --> 03:39:51.545
MOST PART WAS HEY WE'VE DONE A

03:39:51.611 --> 03:39:53.647
LOT. YOU DIDN'T HEAR THEM SAY

03:39:53.713 --> 03:39:55.115
IN COURT PROCEEDINGS THAT WE

03:39:55.181 --> 03:39:57.117
ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING IN OUR

03:39:57.183 --> 03:39:59.119
SMALL COURT ROOMS ARE SAFE. AND

03:39:59.185 --> 03:40:00.820
I BELIEVE YOU'VE NOT HEARD THAT

03:40:00.887 --> 03:40:01.955
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A

03:40:02.022 --> 03:40:03.990
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS BACK THAT

03:40:04.057 --> 03:40:05.725
UP. I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH

03:40:05.792 --> 03:40:07.527
EXPERT BUT NEITHER ARE THE

03:40:07.594 --> 03:40:09.062
JUDGES THAT WE'RE ASKING.

03:40:09.129 --> 03:40:12.732
INDIVIDUALLY COURTROOM BY COURT

03:40:12.799 --> 03:40:13.633
ROOM OR ACROSS. DEPARTMENTS YOU

03:40:13.700 --> 03:40:15.902
MAY THESE. THEY'RE NOT PUBLIC

03:40:15.969 --> 03:40:16.536
HEALTH EXPERTS AND WE SHOULDN'T

03:40:16.603 --> 03:40:18.638
EXPECT THEM TO BE- I BELIEVE

03:40:18.705 --> 03:40:19.873
WHAT WE NEED IS CLEAR

03:40:19.940 --> 03:40:22.342
CONSISTENT GUIDELINES. AND

03:40:22.409 --> 03:40:23.476
STANDARDS THAT ARE SET

03:40:23.543 --> 03:40:25.412
STATEWIDE WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY

03:40:25.478 --> 03:40:27.981
THIRD POINT. WHICH IS BUT I

03:40:28.048 --> 03:40:29.983
STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE

03:40:30.050 --> 03:40:32.586
TO SET MINIMUM. STATEWIDE

03:40:32.652 --> 03:40:34.521
SAFETY AND ACCESS STANDARDS FOR

03:40:34.588 --> 03:40:36.656
OUR COURTS. I THINK WE HAVE TOO

03:40:36.723 --> 03:40:38.592
MUCH OF A DISJOINTED CHAOTIC

03:40:38.658 --> 03:40:39.960
DECENTRALIZED PROCESS I

03:40:40.026 --> 03:40:41.227
RECOGNIZE YOUR LOTS OF WAYS IN

03:40:41.294 --> 03:40:42.629
WHICH THAT CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS.

03:40:42.696 --> 03:40:43.763
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE IS

03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:45.632
JEOPARDIZING OUR SAFETY AND

03:40:45.699 --> 03:40:47.901
IT'S IN JEOPARDIZING. THE

03:40:47.968 --> 03:40:50.236
ACCESS TO JUSTICE. IF I WERE IN

03:40:50.303 --> 03:40:51.338
THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD BE

03:40:51.404 --> 03:40:52.839
LOOKING TO THE CHEER COLORED

03:40:52.906 --> 03:40:54.608
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE

03:40:54.674 --> 03:40:55.909
APPLY FOR MANY THINGS ACROSS

03:40:55.976 --> 03:40:57.611
COUNTIES AND I WOULD ASK PUBLIC

03:40:57.677 --> 03:40:59.813
HEALTH EXPERTS TO TELL ME WHAT

03:40:59.879 --> 03:41:01.381
LEVEL OF SAFETY IS APPROPRIATE

03:41:01.448 --> 03:41:02.449
IN TERMS OF IN PERSON

03:41:02.515 --> 03:41:03.817
PROCEEDINGS. IN TERMS OF WHAT

03:41:03.883 --> 03:41:04.951
OTHER PROTECTION SHOULD BE IN

03:41:05.018 --> 03:41:06.853
PLACE AT THE VARIOUS LEVELS

03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:08.188
THAT WE HAVE OF THAT COLOR

03:41:08.254 --> 03:41:09.856
TIERED SYSTEM. AND I WOULD

03:41:09.923 --> 03:41:12.158
MANDATE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS

03:41:12.225 --> 03:41:13.893
FOR THE COURTS IN THAT RESPECT.

03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:15.829
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT

03:41:15.895 --> 03:41:16.896
THAT THERE IS OFTEN AND

03:41:16.963 --> 03:41:19.599
UNDERSTANDABLY. HESITANCY FROM

03:41:19.666 --> 03:41:21.301
A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO MANDATE

03:41:21.368 --> 03:41:22.869
THANKS TO THE JUDICIARY AND

03:41:22.936 --> 03:41:24.070
THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO TRY VERY

03:41:24.137 --> 03:41:25.905
CAREFULLY THERE. BUT USUAL

03:41:25.972 --> 03:41:27.340
COUNSELORS HAD THE AUTHORITY

03:41:27.407 --> 03:41:28.408
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS

03:41:28.475 --> 03:41:30.010
PANDEMIC TO SET THOSE MINIMUM

03:41:30.076 --> 03:41:32.045
STANDARDS. INDEED THEY HAVE

03:41:32.112 --> 03:41:33.647
THEIR INDIVIDUAL COURTS SOME

03:41:33.713 --> 03:41:35.015
HAVE SET STANDARDS SOME OF NOT

03:41:35.081 --> 03:41:36.583
INDIVIDUAL JUDGES UPSET SOME

03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:38.785
SOME HAVE NOT. IT'S A PATCHWORK

03:41:38.852 --> 03:41:40.520
THAT DOES NOT HAVE CONSISTENCY

03:41:40.587 --> 03:41:42.355
IT IS NOT KEEPING US SAFE IT IS

03:41:42.422 --> 03:41:43.690
NOT KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE IS

03:41:43.757 --> 03:41:45.392
NOT KEEPING LITIGANTS SAFE. IT

03:41:45.458 --> 03:41:47.327
IS NOT KEEPING MY LAWYERS ARE

03:41:47.394 --> 03:41:48.828
GOING INTO COURT WITH A STAFF

03:41:48.895 --> 03:41:50.163
FOR WORKING IMPORTS WERE JURORS

03:41:50.230 --> 03:41:52.832
SAY. IN A IN A CONSISTENT

03:41:52.899 --> 03:41:54.167
SYSTEMATIC WAY. SO WE NEED SOME

03:41:54.234 --> 03:41:56.102
STANDARDS THAT DO THAT WE DO

03:41:56.169 --> 03:41:57.604
NOT NEED THE LEGISLATURE I

03:41:57.671 --> 03:41:58.638
DON'T BELIEVE TO DICTATE

03:41:58.705 --> 03:41:59.673
EVERYTHING THE COURTS THERE'S

03:41:59.739 --> 03:42:01.641
LOTS OF ROOMS. THE ROOM FOR THE

03:42:01.708 --> 03:42:02.609
COURTS TO INNOVATE AND BE

03:42:02.676 --> 03:42:04.678
FLEXIBLE AND IT JUST IN TERMS

03:42:04.744 --> 03:42:05.478
OF THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT

03:42:05.545 --> 03:42:06.946
NEEDED. WHAT WE NEED A MINIMUM

03:42:07.013 --> 03:42:09.683
FLOOR WHEN WE SAY AT A MINIMUM.

03:42:09.749 --> 03:42:16.289
IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS. IN THIS

03:42:16.356 --> 03:42:16.923
YEAR YOU SHOULD NOT BE HAVING A

03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:19.159
IN PERSON. I'M THEY KNEW THESE.

03:42:19.225 --> 03:42:20.126
PUBLICLY HEALTH EXPERTS SAID

03:42:20.193 --> 03:42:20.694
GUIDELINES FOR WHAT YOU BE

03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:21.695
GOING ON. I BELIEVE THAT IF HAD

03:42:21.761 --> 03:42:23.229
THE- WE WOULD NOT BE HAVING ANY

03:42:23.296 --> 03:42:25.665
REMOTE. PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY

03:42:25.732 --> 03:42:26.566
ARE ALMOST NO REMOTE

03:42:26.633 --> 03:42:27.500
PROCEEDINGS IN THE STATE OF

03:42:27.567 --> 03:42:29.035
CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THAT OUR

03:42:29.102 --> 03:42:30.236
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WERE

03:42:30.303 --> 03:42:30.970
DRIVING WHAT SHOULD BE

03:42:31.037 --> 03:42:32.405
HAPPENING ON COURT ROOMS WE

03:42:32.472 --> 03:42:33.740
WILL ALL BE LOOKING AT A

03:42:33.807 --> 03:42:36.342
SYSTEM. LIKE THE ONE ALAMEDA

03:42:36.409 --> 03:42:36.943
HAS AT LEAST FOR THE IMMEDIATE

03:42:37.010 --> 03:42:39.179
FUTURE. AND THE LAST POINT I'LL

03:42:39.245 --> 03:42:40.013
MAKE I KNOW I SAID IN MY FINAL

03:42:40.080 --> 03:42:41.581
POINT IT'LL MAKE ONE MORE.

03:42:41.648 --> 03:42:43.216
WHICH IS THAT I THINK THERE'S A

03:42:43.283 --> 03:42:45.885
LOT. OF COLLABORATIVE CREATIVE

03:42:45.952 --> 03:42:47.287
STUFF THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

03:42:47.353 --> 03:42:49.389
DONE AND THAT CAN BE A MODEL

03:42:49.456 --> 03:42:51.591
FOR WHAT WE DO. IN LOTS OF WAYS

03:42:51.658 --> 03:42:53.259
THAT CAN INCREASE AT CHRIS

03:42:53.326 --> 03:42:53.793
ACCESS YOU'VE HEARD FROM

03:42:53.860 --> 03:42:55.295
VARIOUS FOLKS. THAT THEY'RE

03:42:55.361 --> 03:42:56.496
HOPEFUL THAT SOME OF THE STUFF

03:42:56.563 --> 03:42:58.965
WE'VE ALREADY DONE. CAN CAN CAN

03:42:59.032 --> 03:43:00.266
BUILD THE BEST THAT DIFFERENT

03:43:00.333 --> 03:43:01.634
WORLD IN A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

03:43:01.701 --> 03:43:03.670
JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS WE MOVE INTO

03:43:03.737 --> 03:43:05.472
THE AFTER TIMES. IF WE CAN DEAL

03:43:05.538 --> 03:43:06.840
WITH A BACKLOG IF WE CAN DEAL

03:43:06.906 --> 03:43:09.275
WITH THE OVERWHELMING. SCALE

03:43:09.342 --> 03:43:11.611
ISSUES THERE'S LOTS OF POSITIVE

03:43:11.678 --> 03:43:12.212
BEST PRACTICES THAT CAN COME

03:43:12.278 --> 03:43:14.347
OUT OF THIS THAT CAN MAKE US

03:43:14.414 --> 03:43:15.448
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO INCREASE

03:43:15.515 --> 03:43:17.217
ACCESS. THAT CAN THAT CAN MAKE

03:43:17.283 --> 03:43:19.052
IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PLUG IN

03:43:19.119 --> 03:43:21.387
ACCESS JUSTICE- THERE'S LOTS OF

03:43:21.454 --> 03:43:22.889
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING OUR

03:43:22.956 --> 03:43:24.324
COURTS BETTER IN THIS CURRENT

03:43:24.390 --> 03:43:26.659
SYSTEM IN MANY INSTANCES. WE

03:43:26.726 --> 03:43:27.861
NEED TO STATE KEEP THOSE

03:43:27.927 --> 03:43:28.962
ASPECTS OF THINGS AS WE MOVE

03:43:29.028 --> 03:43:30.363
FORWARD WHAT WE NEED TO

03:43:30.430 --> 03:43:33.066
CORRECT. THE FUNDAMENTAL LACK

03:43:33.133 --> 03:43:34.601
OF SAFETY THAT IS STILL GOING

03:43:34.667 --> 03:43:35.902
ON AND TOO MANY OF OUR COURT

03:43:35.969 --> 03:43:38.104
ROOMS. AND SO AGAIN I REALLY

03:43:38.171 --> 03:43:39.506
CALL IN THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP

03:43:39.572 --> 03:43:41.441
INTO THAT VOID. YOU HEARD FROM

03:43:41.508 --> 03:43:42.475
MY COLLEAGUE UP NORTH

03:43:42.542 --> 03:43:45.211
GENEVIEVE. EARLY LEADER FROM

03:43:45.278 --> 03:43:46.346
THEIR ILLEGAL EIGHT WHERE SHE

03:43:46.412 --> 03:43:47.347
SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE

03:43:47.413 --> 03:43:48.882
JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS PUTTING IT

THE STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE

03:44:57.884 --> 03:44:59.652
JUST UP A LITTLE OVER FIVE

03:44:59.719 --> 03:45:02.222
MILES AWAY. WHY THE SPOTLIGHT

03:45:02.288 --> 03:45:04.591
ON THE DEPENDENCY COURT. THE

03:45:04.657 --> 03:45:06.059
DEPENDENCY COURT ADDRESSES A

03:45:06.125 --> 03:45:11.931

BEHALF OF A LITIGANT POPULATION

03:45:14.167 --> 03:45:14.801
SIMILAR TO WHAT IS SEEN IN

03:45:14.868 --> 03:45:16.803
OTHER COURTS THEY'RE OFTEN LOW

03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:18.838
INCOME LITIGANTS THERE OFTEN

03:45:18.905 --> 03:45:21.441
PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT IS TO SAY

03:45:21.507 --> 03:45:22.408
THAT THE CASE IS SEEN IN

03:45:22.475 --> 03:45:23.810
DEPENDENCY COURT- NOT UNLIKE

03:45:23.877 --> 03:45:25.478
THE MATTERS WE NEED AS A LEGAL

03:45:25.545 --> 03:45:27.280

03:45:30.316 --> 03:45:32.452
BEHALF OF LOW INCOME LITIGANTS

03:45:32.518 --> 03:45:34.153
OF COLOR. WHEN FACED WITH THE

03:45:34.220 --> 03:45:35.722
PANDEMIC AND REALIZING THE NEED

03:45:35.788 --> 03:45:37.557
TO CONTINUE TO GRANT ACCESS TO

03:45:37.624 --> 03:45:39.359
THE COURTS WHILE PROVIDING A

03:45:39.425 --> 03:45:41.094
SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE

03:45:41.160 --> 03:45:42.762
DEPENDENCY COURT DECIDED IT

03:45:42.829 --> 03:45:44.130
WOULD MOVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS

03:45:44.197 --> 03:45:46.199
REMOTE ACCESS PLATFORM ACROSS

03:45:46.266 --> 03:45:48.468
ALL ITS COURTS. NAMELY THE WEB

03:45:48.534 --> 03:45:50.803
EXPORT PLATFORM. THIS WAS DONE

03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:52.071
BECAUSE THE COURT IMMEDIATELY

03:45:52.138 --> 03:45:54.340
RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PRESERVE

03:45:54.407 --> 03:45:56.776
HEALTH AND SAFETY. HOWEVER THEY

03:45:56.843 --> 03:45:58.211
DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF ENSURING

03:45:58.278 --> 03:46:01.581
COURT ACCESS AS A GOAL. TO MAKE

03:46:01.648 --> 03:46:02.882
THE TRANSITION TO WEBEX THEY

03:46:02.949 --> 03:46:04.250
PURPOSEFULLY AND INTENTIONALLY

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:06.853
CLOSED ALL BUT FOUR COURTS.

03:46:06.920 --> 03:46:07.954
WHAT OTHERS WERE BEING

03:46:08.021 --> 03:46:10.690
OUTFITTED WITH WEBEX. THEY

03:46:10.757 --> 03:46:11.724
UNDERSTOOD THIS WOULD CAUSE A

03:46:11.791 --> 03:46:14.060
BACKLOG BUT THEY ALSO WORK TO

03:46:14.127 --> 03:46:15.828
HAVE A PRIORITY LIST OF URGENT

03:46:15.895 --> 03:46:17.196
HEARINGS THAT WOULD STILL BE

03:46:17.263 --> 03:46:20.633
OUT. AND MANY OF THOSE MATTERS

03:46:20.700 --> 03:46:23.870
WERE HANDLED VIA STIPULATION.

03:46:23.937 --> 03:46:25.505
IF NOT BY REMOTE ACCESS THEM BY

03:46:25.571 --> 03:46:27.307
STIPULATION ULTIMATELY THEY

03:46:27.373 --> 03:46:30.710
HANDLED THREE THOUSAND CASES BY

03:46:30.777 --> 03:46:32.378
ELECTRONIC STIPULATION. AND

03:46:32.445 --> 03:46:34.314
THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ADOPTIONS

03:46:34.380 --> 03:46:35.448
HEARINGS I WISH THERE WERE

03:46:35.515 --> 03:46:38.351
HUNDREDS THAT WERE HANDLED

03:46:38.418 --> 03:46:39.986
REMOTELY DURING THE PANDEMIC.

03:46:40.053 --> 03:46:41.921
THOSE THREE THOUSAND MATTERS

03:46:41.988 --> 03:46:43.957
HANDLED BY STIPULATION OR

03:46:44.023 --> 03:46:45.391
HANDLED COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF

03:46:45.458 --> 03:46:47.193
THE COURT THEY WERE FILED.

03:46:47.260 --> 03:46:48.861
JUDGES REVIEWED AND SIGNED THE

03:46:48.928 --> 03:46:51.130
STIPULATIONS ALL WITHOUT A

03:46:51.197 --> 03:46:53.399
HEARING OR APPEARANCES. IT IS

03:46:53.466 --> 03:46:54.233
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

03:46:54.300 --> 03:46:56.502
SOMETIMES THESE STIPULATIONS OR

03:46:56.569 --> 03:46:59.372
FOR THE PURPOSE OF. ISSUE MERIT

03:46:59.439 --> 03:47:01.174
THAT IS TO SAY THEY DID NOT

03:47:01.240 --> 03:47:02.775
RESOLVE THE ENTIRE CASE BUT

03:47:02.842 --> 03:47:04.744
WERE ABLE TO NARROW DOWN THE

03:47:04.811 --> 03:47:07.413
ISSUES IN QUESTION. BY JUNE ALL

03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:08.548
DEPENDENCY COURTS WERE

03:47:08.614 --> 03:47:10.850
OUTFITTED WITH WEBEX. THEY HAVE

03:47:10.917 --> 03:47:13.019
NOW BEEN WORKING FOR MORE THAN

03:47:13.086 --> 03:47:14.554
SIX MONTHS ON A COMPLETELY

03:47:14.620 --> 03:47:16.723
REMOTE ACCESS STRUCTURE AND AS

03:47:16.789 --> 03:47:18.491
A RESULT THEY'RE HANDLING

03:47:18.558 --> 03:47:20.426
LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CASES

03:47:20.493 --> 03:47:23.896
EVERY WEEK USING WEBEX. AND AS

SPEAKERS THIS IS CARD IS

03:47:26.833 --> 03:47:27.700
BECAUSE SOME UNINTENDED

03:47:27.767 --> 03:47:29.469
BENEFITS. THE PERCENTAGE OF

03:47:29.535 --> 03:47:30.837
LITIGANTS WHO SHOW UP FOR

03:47:30.903 --> 03:47:33.206
HEARINGS HAVE INCREASE BECAUSE

03:47:33.272 --> 03:47:35.375
THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL. AND

03:47:35.441 --> 03:47:36.843
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE AS

03:47:36.909 --> 03:47:39.612
MUCH TIME OFF OF WORK TO GIVE

03:47:39.679 --> 03:47:41.748
JUST TWO EXAMPLES. THIS IS NOT

03:47:41.814 --> 03:47:42.949
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN STANLEY

MOSK AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND.

03:47:44.851 --> 03:47:46.219
THIS IS NOT ACROSS THE COUNTY

03:47:46.285 --> 03:47:47.954
LINE THIS IS WITHIN THE SAME

03:47:48.021 --> 03:47:49.756
COUNTY JUST A LITTLE OVER FIVE

03:47:49.822 --> 03:47:51.858
MILES AWAY. WHEN IT COMES TO

03:47:51.924 --> 03:47:53.493
THE STANLEY MOSK COURTHOUSE WE

END OF THE COUNTY TO THE SANTA

03:48:14.947 --> 03:48:16.716
MONICA COURTHOUSE. THAT IS

03:48:16.783 --> 03:48:17.817
WHERE ATTORNEYS FROM OUR

OFFICE. AND ATTORNEYS FROM

03:48:19.285 --> 03:48:21.654

COURT HEARING. SO AS MY

03:48:39.572 --> 03:48:40.573
COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED IT IS

03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:42.642
CRITICAL TO HAVE STANDARDIZED

03:48:42.708 --> 03:48:45.511
PROTOCOLS POLICIES AND MEASURES

03:48:45.578 --> 03:48:47.013
THAT BALANCE BOTH ACCESS TO

JUSTICE AND HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:48:49.415 --> 03:48:50.483
AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME

03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:51.884
SIMPLE STEPS THAT ALL COURTS

03:48:51.951 --> 03:48:54.053

03:58:00.099 --> 03:58:01.033
BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE WE'RE

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:02.601
LARA AND WE WERE NOT GETTING

03:58:02.668 --> 03:58:06.205
THINGS FOR ON A TINY BASE. SO I

03:58:06.271 --> 03:58:08.273
THINK FROM FREE TROUBLE STAND.

03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:08.807
ONE HUNDRED REMOTE TO THE

03:58:08.874 --> 03:58:10.476

03:58:10.542 --> 03:58:11.043
NEED TO HAVE SOME UNIFORMS

03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:14.013
RULES ON THAT. I THINK THAT

03:58:14.079 --> 03:58:15.681
THOSE LITIGANTS WHO- CANNOT

03:58:15.748 --> 03:58:18.317

MADE WE SEE SOMETHING UP WITH

03:58:20.219 --> 03:58:23.422
HIS AND THAT THE JUDGE MELANIE

03:58:23.489 --> 03:58:26.592
COUNTY SAID. GIVEN SO THAT THEY-

03:58:26.659 --> 03:58:29.228

TWENTY TWENTY BUT IT HAD

04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:47.092
CHALLENGES IT WAS A SINGLE

04:01:47.159 --> 04:01:48.694
CAMERA AND THE ANGLE WASN'T

04:01:48.760 --> 04:01:49.695
ENOUGH FOR REPORTER TO

04:01:49.761 --> 04:01:51.296
DIFFERENTIATE EVEN WHO WAS

04:01:51.363 --> 04:01:53.432
SPEAKING. THE SOUND WAS TENNEY

04:01:53.498 --> 04:01:54.867
AND IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE BUT

04:01:54.933 --> 04:01:56.969
OUR I. T. DIVISION WENT TO WORK

04:01:57.035 --> 04:01:57.769
RIGHT AWAY TO RESOLVE THOSE

04:01:57.836 --> 04:02:00.005

DID RESUME TESTING LATER IN THE

04:02:09.147 --> 04:02:10.482
FALL IT WAS UNDER REMOTE

04:02:10.549 --> 04:02:16.455

ULTIMATELY IS THE REMOTE SYSTEM

04:02:46.919 --> 04:02:49.621
GOOD ENOUGH. PERHAPS IT IS. BUT

04:02:49.688 --> 04:02:50.956
EVEN IF WE CAN GET TO GOOD

04:02:51.023 --> 04:02:52.658

HISTORY. IF IT IS SET IN A

04:03:08.974 --> 04:03:10.509
COURTROOM AND A REPORTER

04:03:10.575 --> 04:03:11.476

CAN'T BE REVIEWED OR ANALYZE OR

04:03:22.087 --> 04:03:24.623
BE PROCESSED THROUGH ANY FORM

04:03:24.690 --> 04:03:26.858
OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. IT JUST

04:03:26.925 --> 04:03:28.126

RECORDING DOES. AND A CORD

04:03:44.810 --> 04:03:46.244
INJURY CAN EVEN MAKE A DECISION

04:03:46.311 --> 04:03:47.379
BASED ON THAT INCOMPLETE

04:03:47.446 --> 04:03:49.948
RECORD. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THAT

04:03:50.015 --> 04:03:51.583
END RESULT IS ULTIMATELY

04:03:51.650 --> 04:03:53.585
INCONSEQUENTIAL. HOW THE COURT

04:03:53.652 --> 04:03:55.654
OR JURY GOT TO THAT END RESULT

04:03:55.721 --> 04:03:57.622

04:27:25.396 --> 04:27:28.465
WE- INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN

THAT COMMUNICATION. LET ME JUST

04:27:30.167 --> 04:27:31.969
ADD REAL QUICKLY THAT I THINK

04:27:32.035 --> 04:27:32.569
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS TWO

04:27:32.636 --> 04:27:34.738
DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE IS WHAT DO

04:27:34.805 --> 04:27:36.540
WE DO DURING THE PANDEMIC. TO

04:27:36.607 --> 04:27:38.876
INSURE. AS MUCH ACCESS AS

04:27:38.942 --> 04:27:42.780
POSSIBLE. WHILE PROTECTING

04:27:42.846 --> 04:27:43.514
HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUT I THE

04:27:43.580 --> 04:27:45.082
SEPARATE. IT REALLY SHOULD BE.

04:27:45.149 --> 04:27:46.950
AND MAYBE EVEN DEFERRED IS WHAT

04:27:47.017 --> 04:27:49.553
DO WE DO AFTERWARDS IF AS ONE

04:27:49.620 --> 04:27:51.054
WITNESS STATED WE SHOULD TAKE

04:27:51.121 --> 04:27:51.622
SOME OF THE BEST OF WHAT'S

04:27:51.688 --> 04:27:53.323
GOING ON NOW. AND GO FORWARD

04:27:53.390 --> 04:27:55.826
WITH IT. NOW MAY NOT BE THE

04:27:55.893 --> 04:27:57.294
BEST TIME TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE

04:27:57.361 --> 04:27:57.895
ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE

04:27:57.961 --> 04:28:00.164
TENT AND- WE STILL HAVE NOT

04:28:00.230 --> 04:28:02.533
GOTTEN IT RIGHT. DURING THIS

04:28:02.599 --> 04:28:03.867
PANDEMIC AND WE STILL WILL BE

04:28:03.934 --> 04:28:05.502
DEALING WITH PANDEMICS FOR A

04:28:05.569 --> 04:28:07.571

04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:15.546
DECLARATION SO THERE'S PLENTY

04:28:15.612 --> 04:28:16.880
OF TIME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

04:28:16.947 --> 04:28:19.316
