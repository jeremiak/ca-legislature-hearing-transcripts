THAT THIS IS NOT A LOCAL ISSUE

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:27.578
BUT I HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS I

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.347
WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE-

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.616
SHARE THEM- I'M A LITTLE KID

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:34.318
THIS ONLY APPLIES FRESNO COUNTY-

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.020
IF IT'S A POLICY THAT'S A GOOD

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:37.421
POLICY- THAT IT SHOULD APPLY TO

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:40.424
EVERY CAN OF COFFEE COUNTIES IN

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.828
IN THE STATE. COUNTY CHARTER CAN

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.596
. I'M AT SORT OF STEP BY STEP WE

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:46.897
ARE BEGINNING TAKE MORE MORE

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.366
POWER AWAY FROM A CHARTER

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.201
COUNTIES IN MAKING LOOK MUCH

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.369
MORE LIKE GENERAL LAW COUNTIES.

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.570
WITH THERE BEING A PURPOSE FOR

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:55.640
THEM TO BE A TO BE TO BE CHARTER

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.707
COUNTIES- AND THEN JUST MAYBE

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.075
THE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.977
ONLY APPLY TO FRESNO COUNTY AND

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.746
WHY AREN'T WE KNOW THAT THERE'S-

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:02.647
SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY. ASSEMBLY ST

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:05.816
OKAY. A COUPLE OF. DAYS AS WELL

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.184
AS- BRITISCHEN COMMITTEE ONE

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.588
APPLY THIS STATE- INSTEAD OF.JUST JUST TO THE COUNTIES ARE

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:11.889
SOME SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF. OF

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.691
ABUSE IN IN FRESNO THAT YOU'RE

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.526
ADDRESSING WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.662
CONCERN. I I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:19.630
THE BILL THAT WOULD COVER THIS

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.065
FOR ALL COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.667
STATE I BELIEVE THAT BILL HAS

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.402
GOTTEN. TO THE GOVERNOR AND DID

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:26.871
NOT GET HIS SIGNATURE. AND SO

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:29.473
UNTIL THAT TIME I BELIEVE WE

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.475
HAVE TO GO HELLO. COUNTY IN TWO

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.678
WE CAN- CHAU A CRITICAL MASS OF

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:35.112
CAPIZ THAT WOULD LEAD TOWARDS US

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.148
TO ASSESS THE STATE. BUT I AGREE

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:39.283
WITH YOU THAT OVERALL LIFE I

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.718
THINK ALL COUNTY SHOULD REMOVE

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.620
JERRY MAN. AND THERE'S JUST AN

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.522
INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.223
HERE. THAT BELIEVE FOR DROPPING

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:50.728
TO AN ACID. IT'S NOT. SB DOESN'T

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.396
COUNTY BY WHAT HAVE IN PRESS

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:53.297
COUNTY WAS AGREE. THIS LAST

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.499
CYCLE WHERE THEY WERE NOT.

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:56.834
HEARING AND LISTENING TO A

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.869
COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.237
TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH MY BILL

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:02.873
BUT HE EAGERLY ANTICIPATES THE

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.342
BILL THAT WOULD. DO THIS FOR THE

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.744
ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.879
WELL. THE SEATTLE I SHARE SOME

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.681
OF THE CONCERNS THAT- MY

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:14.151
COLLEAGUE FROM BACK. HAS ON THIS

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:16.087
HAS SOME OF IT IS THE

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.088
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SINGLING

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:19.156
OUT ONE JURISDICTION FOR THE

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:21.792

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:24.729
AND- YOU KNOW YOU A FRESNO I

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.897
THINK- IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:30.401
HISTORY- DATE FRESNO COUNTY IS

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.503

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.040
IT IS. AND IT. RENDERING IS

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.908
CONCERNED I DON'T THINK THAT

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:38.976
DISAPPEARS WITH A CITIZEN

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:41.078
COMMISSION- HE'LL SEE WHAT

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.313
HAPPENED TO SOME OF OUR

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.614
DISTRICTS IN THIS LAST. THIS

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:45.649
LAST GO ROUND- THERE'S SOME

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:47.985
PRETTY INTERESTING BOUNDARIES

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:51.422
SO- GIVEN. THAT AT LOOKING AT

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:52.723
FRESNO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.592
GOING TO THAT PICK ON FRESNO.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:57.728
AND ERODING THAT LOCAL CONTROL

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:58.929
FOR THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.898

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.500
GET A GET A REFERENDUM AND MAKE

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:03.901

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.415
YOU GET THAT BALLOT ALMOST FOUR

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:34.617
WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY.

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:36.986
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:38.221
ALL TO BE ABLE HAVE A STATE

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.956
HOLIDAY IT'S A WASTE OF

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:42.392
RESOURCES AND FOR THAT REASON- I

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:45.228
WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AT

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:47.397
THIS BILL. TODAY THANK YOU

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.732
MISTER MAYES BUT YOURSELF. ALL

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:51.334
RIGHT SO I'M GOING TO PAY YOU

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.102
BACK A I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:55.405
ALREADY PREVIOUSLY MADE. FOR

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:58.241
CALLING FROM THE YUCCA VALLEY-

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:01.110
GIVEN OUR CURRENT ELECTION LAWS.

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:03.546
IT'S REALLY NOT NEEDED- THE FOUR

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.348
DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION DAY THE

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.584
PEOPLE CAN VOTE IN PERSON- GIVES

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:09.252
THEM A WEEKEND SATURDAY SUNDAY

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.187
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. SO THAT THEY

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:13.323
CAN GO IN- MOST PEOPL-

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:14.757
ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:16.659
ALREADY OFF. ON SATURDAY AND

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.428
SUNDAY. AND THEN MOST PEOPLE ARE

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:21.264
OFF ON SUNDAYS. SO THAT ALLOWS

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.599
THE PRIVATE PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.300
SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:26.569
BE TREATED EQUALLY- THIS WOULD

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.504
SET UP A SITUATION WHEN WE'RE

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:30.573
TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE NOT BEING

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.709
ABLE TO GO TO THE POLLS MOST

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.811
PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES ARE

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:36.779
ACTUALLY NOT THE PEOPLE THAT.

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:37.981
SHOULD BE THIS SHOULD BE AIMED

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:41.551
AT- BECAUSE THEIR THEIR JOBS ARE

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:42.919
INHERENTLY BETTER JOBS AND

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.754
BETTER PAID AND THEY ALSO HAVE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.522
GOOD BENEFITS. IT WHICH INCLUDES

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.691
TIME OFF TO GO VOTE ON ELECTION

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.927
DAY IF WE IF NEED BE. I USED TO

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.730
HAVE TO MANAGE THIS MYSELF- BY

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:57.567
YOU KNOW WITH A WHOLE BATTALION

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.568
OF FOLKS THAT WANT TO VOTE. BUT

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:00.970
THE ADVENT OF MAIL IN BALLOTS TO

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.639
COME OUT A MONTH AHEAD OF TIME

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:03.907
IT'S REALLY NOT NEEDED. THE

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:05.942
OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THIS- I

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:09.712
ALSO- AND- VERY SENSITIVE TO.

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:11.214
THAT FEBRUARY HOLIDAY THAT'S

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:12.382
PRESIDENT'S DAY WEEKEND IT'S

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:14.317
USUALLY A FOUR DAY HOLIDAY.

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:15.785
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG HOLIDAYS

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.220
THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:18.855
THEIR KIDS TAKE A BREAK FROM

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:21.090
SCHOOL AND GET OUT OF TOWN. AND

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.959
THAT'S ALSO A WINTER HOLIDAY SO

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.427
EXPAND SOME OF THE THAT THINGS

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.763
THAT THEY GET TO DO- IN THAT

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.631
TIME AND IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.400
FOR THE HOLIDAYS- BREAKING THAT

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:31.834
UP AND NOT LETTING THEM DO THAT

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:34.504
EVERY SECOND YEAR- I THINK IT.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.273
IS TOO MUCH OF A TRADE OFF. TO

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.975
GAIN WHAT I THINK IS NOT REALLY

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.843
MUCH FROM THIS IF YOU HAD

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.578
BROUGHT THIS WHEN WE DID NOT

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:44.914
HAVE OUR CURRENT LAWS. SET UP

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.950
FOR A GROUP A FOR MAILING

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.451
VOTING. PRIVATE PROBABLY BE OKAY

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:51.020
WITH IT- BUT SINCE IT IT DIVIDES

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:52.288
THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:53.756
SECTOR. IT TAKES AWAY THAT

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.558
HOLIDAY THAT IS VALUABLE TO

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.161
FAMILIES AND- IN IT'S JUST NOT

00:59:58.227 --> 01:00:02.332
NEEDED- I'LL ALSO BE VOTING NO.

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:04.667
THANKS ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:07.837

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:09.305
AUTHORS GOALS OF REDUCING

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.140
BARRIERS TO VOTING- I AM

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.241
CONCERNED THAT PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:13.509
HAVE WON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.645
FOLLOW THE STATES LEAD ON

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.146

RECENTLY VOTE BY MAIL EXPANSION

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.450
EXPANDING THE WINDOW TO VOTING

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.585
BUT I THINK A LOT OF THOSE

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:23.853
EFFORTS MAKING ELECTION DAY A

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.520
HOLIDAY AS ANOTHER TOOL TOWARD

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.989
