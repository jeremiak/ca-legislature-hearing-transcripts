SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORKING FAMILIES IN THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE ENTITLED CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. CLOSING THE GAPS IN A TIME OF GROWING INEQUALITY AND IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ANOTHER HEARING OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE IN THE WRONG ROOM. BUT IF OU ARE HERE FOR US WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT YOU ARE HERE- I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY EXCITING- OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ- WORK THAT BOTH SHE AND I HAVE BEEN DOING. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO TRY TO BRING- CALIFORNIA'S WORKPLACE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO I AM SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON I REPRESENT THE NINETEENTH SENATE DISTRICT WHICH IS ALL OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND WESTERN PART OF INTERNET COMPANIES I CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE. ON WOMEN WORKING FAMILIES HI THIS IMAGE I'M DELIGHTED TO BE JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AND COHORT IN CRIME. OF PRESENTING THE EIGHTIETH DISTRICT ALL OF BE HAPPY TO- HIM THE GAVEL TO HURT SO THAT SHE CAN INTRODUCE HERSELF AS WELL BUT- AGAIN WE'RE HERE BECAUSE. CENTURIES THE WORK OF CARING FOR NEWBORNS AND FAMILY MEMBERS- AND THE ELDERLY HAS LARGELY IF ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEEN DEEMED AS WOMEN'S WORK- IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING WHEN. I'VE SEEN WHEN MEN- ARE FORCED TO SPEND TIME AT HOME EITHER CARING FOR A NEWBORN OR SICK PARENT THEIR MORE ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO WORK. THAN EVER- BECAUSE THE ILLUSIONIST BAND THAT WOMEN'S WORK IS REALLY QUITE EASY- THAT WOMEN ARE THE ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE DOING IT- AND THAT- MIX RESPONSIBILITY IS THE MORE IMPORTANT TO WORK OUT WORKPLACE AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MORE WOMEN ARE WORKING. THEY ARE THAN EVER BEFORE EITHER A SOUL. OF PRIMARY BREADWINNER OR IN TODAY'S WORLD THERE INCOMES NECESSARY EVEN A TWO INCOME FAMILY IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I REMEMBER AS A CHILD I CAME FROM AN INTACT OF TWO PARENT FAMILY MY DAD WORKED MY MOM WAS A STAY AT HOME MOM. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THAT WORLD- THAT IS NOT THE WORLD TODAY I THINK IF THAT WERE THE SITUATION WITH MY FOLKS AND BOTH BE WORKING IN THE QUESTION WOULD BE. HOW DO WE ACCOMMODATE WHEN PERRANCE GETS SICK CHILDREN ARE SICK. A AND WHEN THEY WERE NEWBORNS IN A FAMILY. LEE I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MORE YOUNG MEN TODAY WHO WILL BE PART OF THAT EXPERIENCE THAT. THE EXPERIENCE OF RAISING CHILDREN OF CARING FOR NEWBORNS IS ONE THAT IS RICH. AND SATISFYING EXPERIENCE BUT THE WORKPLACE TODAY JUST HAS NOT BEEN AS ACCOMMODATING. AS IT SHOULD BE- AND ACCORDING TO A AN EXCELLENT BACKGROUND-PAPER WHICH IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH. HAS CONDUCTED IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE SENATE SEKOLAH. SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORKING FAMILIES WEBSITE. IN 201650% OF CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN A YEAR 50% WERE IN A HOUSEHOLD. WHERE EITHER BOTH PARENTS WORK OR THEIR SINGLE PARENT. FIFTY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IT WAS ONLY TWENTY PERCENT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED AND THAT WE MUST DO AND I HAVE TO SAY- THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS THE VERY SHAMEFUL DISTINCTION. OF BEING THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT A PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. SO IF THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM IS SUPPOSED TO BE THEN I SUSPECT WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT DEFINITION- SO WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT LEAD- WE IN CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO BE FIRST. EVEN IF WE DON'T NECESSARILY DO IT BEST- BUT WE DO LIKE TO BE FIRST AND- WE WERE FIRST BACK IN I THINK WAS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR US THEN SENATOR SHEILA KEWL. OF A DEAR FRIEND OF VISIONARY IN MANY AREAS THAT WERE ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT WAS ABLE TO CREATE THE NATION'S FIRST PAID FAMILY PROGRAM NOW IT WAS FIRST IT HAD ISSUES OF FIFTEEN YEARS LATER WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND WE NEED TO THE PATIENTS. THAT EXIST DAY IN THIS PROGRAM SO. I KNOW MEMBER GONZALEZ WILL TALK ABOUT HER OWN WORK ON THIS AND I THINK THIS WAS A SINGLE PARENT RAISING A FAMILY THE CHALLENGES THAT SHE HAD TO INJURE WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE WITNESSED TALKING ABOUT. IN REAL TIME WHAT IT'S- FOR WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN. A CARING FOR OUR LOVED ONES AND PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE IS TRUST A NON STARTER AS A PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE'RE SHOULD BE IN TODAY'S WORLD SO- WE HAVE A INEQUALITY THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. ARE ABLE TO- HIRE PEOPLE AND TO OR TO TAKE THE TIME WITHOUT THE SAME CONCERNS. BUT FOR OUR LOW INCOME OR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES THIS TRUST IS NOT A REALITY SO WE ARE IMPORTANT JUNCTURE GOVERNOR NEWSOME- HAS MADE TO STRENGTHENING OUR PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM UP I ALREADY HE IS PUT TOGETHER. A TASK FORCE THEY WILL NOT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE NEXT. TWO THAT I HOPE WILL BE A FOLLOW UP HE. HI LÃ  OR TWO OF WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF AS WELL. AND BRINGING THESE ARE IDEAS TO FRUITION SO. REALLY IN A WIVES FEEL LIKE I'M A LITTLE BIT PREACHING TO THE CHOIR- AND DO YOU NOTICE PRIMARILY WOMEN IN THIS ROOM TODAY- BUT THAT'S FINE BECAUSE WE HAVE A STRONG VOICE AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO AND WE ARE RELENTLESS. AND FEARLESS WHAT OTHER GOOD ADJECTIVES CAN PUT IN THERE BAD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO- AGAIN LAST COMMENT. THE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHITE HOUSE REPORT FROM THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS REPORTED THE PAID LEAVE POLICIES HELPED BUSINESSES AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT THIS IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS AS WELL AS GOOD FOR THE FAMILY ONE DOES NOT PRECLUDE OR EXCLUDE THE OTHER IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE STUDY IT HELPS BUSINESSES RECRUIT THE BEST WORKERS. IT INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT WOMEN WILL STAYON THE JOB AFTER HAVING A CHILD AND SAVE EMPLOYERS THE COSTS RELATED TO RECRUITING AND TRAINING EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES THAT NO THIS AND HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR DECADES AND I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ONE IN MY DISTRICT. A COMPANY CALLED PATAGONIA SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THEM. THEY HAVE HEAD THEREOF HEAD SHOT UP ON SITE CHILDCARE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. THEY GIVE THEIR EMPLOYEES PAID TIME OFF TO REBOOT THEY GIVE THEM THE KINDS OF BENEFITS AND FOR THEM THEY- ALLEGE THIS IS A MONEY MAKER. AS PEOPLE COME AND THEY STAY AND THEY'RE ALREADY ON THEIR SECOND OR THIRD GENERATION OF EMPLOYEES. OR GRANDPARENTS I THINK IT HAD WORKED FOR THIS COMPANY. WALK IN THIS ISSUE WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE LEAD AND IT IS TIME FOR US SHOP WE ARE THE STATE THAT INVENTS THE FUTURE ACCORDING TO OUR- LATE HISTORIAN. KEVIN STARR AND THE WE NEED TO AGAIN BECOME THE STATEMENTS OF FUTURAMA SO WITH THAT I WILL PASS THE BATON AND THE GAVEL TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR SOME OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU SENATOR GOOD MORNING WELCOME EVERYONE MY NAME IS LORETTA GONZALEZ ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR THE EIGHTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT AND CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE I DO WANT TO NOTE. THAT ONE OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A FATHER SHOWED UP AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH NOT JUST WOMEN CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE- SAYS I THINK YOU'RE SIMPLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY. T. JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR THANK YOU. THAT WOULD BE pWON I THINK- SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON REALLY MY WRITER DIE ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW HOLD AT WE MADE A PACT THAT BEFORE SHE FINISHES THIS YEAR THIS IS ONE OF THOSE- THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET DONE DON'T WORRY. THERE IS A LIST OF THEM HER AT NINE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THIS YEAR YES. WE WILL GET AT SOME OF THESE THINGS ACTUALLY DONE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT- HISTORICALLY OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. BUT THE TRUTH IS WE DIDN'T DO IT PERFECT- AND WE DIDN'T DO A PASSED AND SO AS A RESULT IN- AND WHAT WE KNOW NOW THERE ARE SOME I THAT.OBVIOUS DISPARITIES AND HOW THIS LAW IS IMPLEMENTED- ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THAT INCOME REPLACEMENT SET TO SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT. AT TODAY HAPPENS TO BE LATINO EQUAL PAY DAY THE DAY WHEN WE REMEMBER THAT LATINOS MAKE FIFTY FOUR CENTS ON THE DOLLAR PER UNDER WHITE ADD MAIL COUNTY ART. IN CALIFORNIA. IN THIS IS THE SHOULD SHAME ALL. YOU TOO IT'S ON THE- WHITE MALE CAM COUNTERPART THAT IS THE LARGEST- PAY GAP OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC. AND ONE WHICH IS EXASPERATED. WHEN. I A LATINO WHAT OUT ON LEAVE. HAVING A CHILD AND BEING PAID SIXTY OR NOT NECESSARILY IN MANY TIMES FOR THAT. THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS SOMETHING THAT SUSTAINABLE SO ALTHOUGH THESE WORKERS PAY IN TO THE SYSTEM AT THE SAME RATE AS EVERYBODY ELSE THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THAT LEAVE- THEIR PAIN FOR IN FACT. WOMEN AND MEN AT AT IN DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT LEAVES SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT DISPARITY IN AND- ADMIT TO OURSELVES THAT IT EXISTS. THE OTHER ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT- A WOMAN HAS A PROTECTION OF COURSE HER JOB OR MAN AND I AM SORRY I. PITCH IT IS WOMEN- BUT THE PROTECT AND SHOP PROTECTION WHEN SHE LEAVES AND THAT IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHICH HIGHLY AFFECTS WHETHER OR NOT- SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE FAMILY LEAVE IF THEY HAVE NO GUARANTEES OF A JOB WHEN COMING BACK- THAT OBVIOUSLY WAYS INTO A DECISION SO. IF YOU COMPOUND THOSE TWO THINGS NOT HAVING THE PROTECTIONS OF THE JOB WHICH WERE WOMAN STILL IN MANDATE STILL DON'T HAVE ALONG WITH- BEING LOWER PAID- THE- RIGHT TO ACCESS FAMILY LEAVE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR HANDS. SO WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THROUGH THE STUDY THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION AND THROUGH SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY IS REALLY A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT FOR THOSE TWO ISSUES THOSE TWO. ISSUES IN THE. THIS MAN AS WELL. SECURITY WITH LONG WAY INTACT ADDING SOME EQUITY INTO OURS. NO WAY DO WE SUGGEST THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE SHOULD BE LONGER IT SHOULD AND WE I THINK SUPPORT THAT IDEA WHOLEHEARTEDLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE- THAT LEAVE LONGER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS THAT. SO TODAY I AM I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FOR OUR SPEAKERS AND OUT CREATING A PATH BY WHICH WE CAN DO YES. THANK YOU SAM REMEMBER AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT TOGETHER WE WILL- STARTER BLOWING UP SOME OF THESE. CULTURAL INFIRMITIES THAT HAVE REALLY KEPT- WOMEN AND FAMILIES SAID DOWN FOR FAR TOO LONG. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO CALL UP OUR FIRST PANELIST. PATRICK CANNING WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. OF KRISTEN SCHUMACHER WHO IS THE SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. AND DOCTOR AGENDA STERN'S ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT UC DAVIS. BUT TO SHARE WITH US- THE HISTORY OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE AS WELL AS THE KEY TAKE UP TRANS BENEFITS. AND SOME OF THE GAPS THAT EXIST IN THE PROGRAM IN EACH PERSON WILL BE ASKED TO SPEAK FOR. SEVEN MINUTES WELL GOOD LUCK. AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR ASSEMBLY PEOPLE- CRITICALLY MY ASSEMBLYMAN- FOR BEING HERE TODAY- MY NAME IS PATRICK HEADING ON THE DIRECTOR THE PLANET DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- AND A PART OF OUR DEPARTMENT HANDLES- THE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS PART AND PARCEL OF HOW- WE ADMINISTER THE PAID LEAVE PROGRAM- I DID WANT TO MAKE OF ONE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH ALL RIGHT OF- RONALD WASHINGTON. WHOSE BRAND NEW TO THE JOB AS DISABILITY INSURANCE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT WHO WILL ACTUALLY BE ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM INTO THE FUTURE. THE END I'M HONORED TO BE ABLE TO. DISCUSS ARE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM- LONG OTHERS ARE THAT OUR DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS IS ONE THAT IS HAS REALLY BECOME A PARTNERSHIP- I THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED- AND THE SENATOR MENTIONED HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CHANGED INVOLVED THIS PROGRAM OVER YEARS I KNOW THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND CHANGE IN THIS ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT. A CALIFORNIA FULL TIME LEGISLATURE IN OUR MINISTRY TO PROCESS- I'M VERY THANKFUL AS ACTUALLY THERE AND HELPED WRITE THE ORIGINAL LAW OTHER THAN INTO PLACE A VICE GOVERNOR DAVIS TO SIGN AND VERY PROUD THAT HE DID IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME BACK. THOUSAND FOUR. WERE MUCH TIGHTER MUCH DIFFERENT- AND WE STOOD UP THIS PROGRAM- AS FAST AND AS EXPERTLY AS WE COULD BUT I THINK MUCH TO- SOMEONE WAS ALSO IS POINT- MAYBE NOT THE EXACT PERFECT THING THAT CALIFORNIA COULD EVENTUALLY GOT TO WE'RE HERE AT THE FIFTEEN. ANNIVERSARY AND I'M EXCITED TO SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM COVERS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION WORKERS- AND IT IS EXCLUSIVELY WORKER FUNDED THE- DIFFERENT THAN. SOME OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A BIFURCATED PROGRAM THIS IS SOLELY FUNDED BY THE WORKERS AND PROVIDES NOT ONLY A GREAT BENEFIT TO THE WORKERS WERE LOOKING TO- USES PROGRAM BUT TO THE EMPLOYERS EMPLOY- THESE WORKERS THESE WORKERS OFTENTIMES HAVE A HIGHER CONNECTIVITY TO THE JOB- FIELD A LOT MORE LOYAL TO THEIR EMPLOYER- AND. GENERALLY TEND TO SPEND MORE TIME OUT THAT ONE EMPLOYER- AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH- WHETHER ITS THE- TAKING CARE OF THE ELDERLY OR OF BONDING WITH THEIR CHILD- EXCITED THAT WE HAVE HAD- RECENT INCREASE UP TO THE- NEW WAGE RATES NOT JUST HAPPENED- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE- BILL WENT FORWARD. A TO RAISE A BETWEEN SEVENTY AND SIXTY PERCENT. OF FOR- HIGHER WAGE WORKERS- AND EXCITED THAT THIS GOVERNOR SORT OF HAS STARTED TO PUT HIS STAMP. ON THE PROGRAM CONVENING A GROUP OF- EXPERTS AROUND A PERRANCE AGENDA- TRYING TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM FOR WORKING FAMILIES WE'VE ALREADY SEEN. SOME OF WHAT THIS WILL MEAN IS A MINISTRATION INCREASING- THE BENEFIT BROWN'S WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS. THAT WOULD GO INTO LAW. I'VE OF NEXT YEAR WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE- WHAT THAT BRINGS WERE IN FACT GOING THROUGH THE COMPUTER TESTING. OF WHAT THE SYSTEM WILL NEED TO BE UPDATED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THAT X. EXPANSION. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT AND I'M SURE THAT- OUR CO CHAIR OF THE SENATOR JACKSON- WILL BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT WERE OF VERY ON TIME WITH OUR IMPLEMENTATION- FOR PRIOR BILL TO BRING- EXIGENCY WHICH IS A WORD- THANK YOU FOR. GIVING ME THAT WORD AS WELL AS OTHER UNITS WERE SO YOU FOR. A FILLED ME WITH OVER A TIME PERIOD HERE. THAT'S THAT'S NOT YOU DISH THAT MEANS GET YOUR YOU KNOW SELF AND GEAR FAST I'LL GIVE YOU SOME YIDDISH WORDS WHEN WE'RE DONE THAT ASSOCIATE WITH THAT BUT I'M I'M SURE HE WILL SENATOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATED LEARNING THOSE OVER. OF MY TIME AS DIRECTOR V. D. D. BUT- TO BE ABLE TO GIE BENEFITS TO OF FOLKS THAT ARE. CAN TO DEPLOY OVERSEAS AND OUR MILITARY FAMILIES- IT'S AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT AND THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY JANUARY ONE. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND APPRECIATE THE- TIME- THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT- THAT NEW BENEFIT- FOR WORKERS- IN A RIGHT WAY. WE HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT SOME OF THE NATIONAL AS IN INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ACROSS THE STATE. AS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT BY THIS COMMITTEE- WE WHILE WE WERE THE FIRST A LOT OF OTHER STATES HAVE. FILED IN BETWEEN- WHAT'S BEEN MOST FASCINATING AS A STUDENT OF GOVERNMENT. IS HOW THE DIFFERENT STATES HAVE TAKEN. OUR PROGRAM AND HAVE ADOPTED IT TO THEMSELVES. LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT THEY PROVIDE BENEFITS SOME HIGHER IN SOMERS SOME LOWER- DIFFERENT- PEOPLETHAT CAN. APPLY FOR THE BENEFIT- IN DIFFERENT STATES WITH DIFFERENT TAXATION RATES WE HAVE- GOSH. YOU NAME IT A WHAT ARE PEOPLE ABLE TO TAKE IT I THINK OREGON HAS A SYSTEM WHERE- THEY DO ALLOW STATE- MEDICAL BUT IT BUT IT'S THE TWELVE WEEKS. CITY COFFEE AND THE DISABILITY. PROGRAM PROVIDE UP TO FIFTY TWO WEEKS. THE PROGRAM OR WEEKS OUR STATE DISABILITY INTO PROGRAM IS JUST BEHIND THAT AND AGAIN THIS IS AT NO COST TO THE EMPLOYERS IN OUR STATE SOLELY BORN ON THE WORKERS. I WAS VERY EXCITED- AND A VERY ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF- THIS LEGISLATURE NOT ONLY- BACK IN- TWENTY FOURTEEN- BUT CONTINUALLY SUPPORTING- THE OUT REACH OFFERS BY BY DEPARTMENT AROUND THIS TO TRY TO INCREASE SOME OF THE UP TECH- AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROGRAM AN ITS EXISTENCE. OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS- IN OTHER STATES LIKE IN MASSACHUSETTS OREGON WASHINGTON. HAVE HAD MONEY UP FRONT SO THAT THEIR STUDENTS THREE KNOWS- THAT THIS PROGRAM IS COMING AND WHAT IT WILL MEAN THE BENEFITS OF IT- AND TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR- THE WORKERS AND THE TIME THAT THEY'RE GONNA NEED. TO BE ABLE TO SPEND- WITH THEIR FAMILY INITIALLY WERE GIVEN SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST BIT OF MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO DO OUT REACH- BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE SPEND IT ENDS WELL TO FROM WHERE WE REALLY YOU SOME MONEY TO TARGET SOME FOLKS- AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN. WAS MET EARLIER. THAT WE HADN'T SEEN TAKING THE USE OF THE PROGRAM. AS WE WOULD HAVE HPED- IN WITH THAT PROGRAM WE DEFINITELY SETON HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN INCREASED AWARENESS ROUND- HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES UNDER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. AND WITH FOLKS TO HAVE LESS OF A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. AFTER THE SURVEY- WE ALSO SAW POST SURVEY AN UP TICK OF- AWARENESS ROME NON AFRICAN AMERICANS OF 11% FOR HISPANICS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. OVERALL WE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE AWARENESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT STANDS AT ABOUT. A 70% FROM PULLING THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO- DO USING SOME THE FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I'D ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR THE CONTINUE FUNDING TO DO THE THESE TYPES OF TARGET AT A RICH TO- WORKERS AND TO EMPLOYERS. STATE. I AM CURRENTLY WERE ABOUT TO UP PUT OUT AN RFP FOR OUR FOR THE UPCOMING TWO YEARS. I DID WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE TRENDS AND USAGE- AND- NOT ONLY HAVE WE READ WITNESS AN INCREASE IN PROGRAM ERNEST BUT ASSUME THAT A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PROGRAM SEARCH INTERSTATE. WHAT WE SEEM FROM THE VERY EARLY YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM TO- THIS YEAR'S THAT WE'VE HAD AN 86% INCREASE IN THE UTILIZATION OF THIS PROGRAM. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THIS AS A SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED- EARLY AS AN IMPORT VERTICALLY FOR MYSELF BEING. A FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN- WAS SAYING THE BONDING CLAIMS AMONG MEN INCREASE FROM- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AT 18% UP TO ABOUT 40% OF A MAN THAT CAN CLAIM- THE BENEFIT CLAIMING IT. AND VERY EXCITED BUT THIS YEAR WE WILL ACTUALLY PAY OUT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS- IN- PAID FAMILY LEAVE CLAIMS- WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARILY EXCITING AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE OTHER STATES COMING UP BEHIND THIS IS AS IMPRESSIVE FOR PROGRAM- IT IS TO BE MATCHED- EDT ALSO. CONDUCTED ANALYSIS ON INDIVIDUALS AT DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS- BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT- CHANGES LAW AROUND THE WE'VE ALL HAD THE DATA FOR ABOUT A YEAR- BUT I AM EXCITED TO SEE WHAT I'D INCREASE. EVENTUALLY BRING TO FURTHER UTILIZATION. WHEN THE LOWER INCOME. THIS IS A MOMENT SALAS POINTED OUT- THE STATISTICS THE STORIES- HIGHLIGHT THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM HAS HAD- EVERY DAY- STATE THAT WE HAVE TALKED TO AND I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT IT'S MAJORITY OF STATES. HAVE TALKED TO US ABOUT- ESTABLISHING PROGRAM MUCH LIKE THIS BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS APPROACHED US AND TALKED ABOUT CREATING A FEDERAL PROGRAM- THE PRESIDENTS. DAUGHTER I THINK SHE HAS A TITLE B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FORGIVE ME I DON'T&lt;/c&gt;</u> KNOW WHAT IT IS- HAS. HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND- I THINK THAT IT'S HELPFUL OF FRANKLY IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE- MOVING ACROSS A WILL AFFECT- FAMILIES AND BE BETTER FOR. ALL AMERICAN FAMILIES THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS IS- MS SCHUMACHER- WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER WHO I UNDERSTAND JUST RECENTLY. RELEASED A REPORT ON THIS VERY TOPIC IT'S ENTITLED. PAID FAMILY LEAVE HELPING WORKERS BALANCE CAREER AND CARE GIVING COMMITMENTS. I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO. SOME SLIDES SO YOU'LL BE PROVIDING FOR OUR- ENTERTAINMENT- AND HOPEFULLY FOR DEMONSTRATING HOW THIS BENEFIT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE. NEEDING THOSE SERVICES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU AS MENTIONED I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE FAMILIAR THE BUDGET CENTER IS A NONPROFIT HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT ENGAGES IN FISCAL POLICY RESEARCH WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE LIVES OF LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS SO TODAY HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW SOME OF OUR FINDINGS FROM. A REPORT SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THE BARRIERS THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE AN ACTIVE SEEN OUR- PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. MANY WORKERS ARE STATE HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF OUR STATES PROSPERITY AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. IS BECAUSE WAGES GENERALLY HAVE BEEN STAGNANT FOR A GENERATION. MR SHOWS HOW HIGH WAGE MID WAGE AND LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE FARED OVERTIME. HI WHICH WORKERS THOSE IN THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE HAVE SEEN THEIR WAGES INCREASE BY ABOUT NINE. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION. HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND MIDWAY GIN LOW WAGE WORKERS I HAVEN'T SEEN A BIG CHANGE. IN THEIR INFLATION ADJUSTED WAGES IN THAT SAME PERIOD. THOSE AT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE THAT'S THE BLUE LINE ON THE CHART THERE. HAVE SEEN ONLY A 1% INCREASE AND LOW WAGE WORKERS. AT THE 10% TELL HAVE ONLY SEEN ABOUT A 10% WORKED HIS MERE 4% INCREASE. BORN IN LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN. AND THEIR DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK AND LATIN X. WORKERS. TO AN AGE OF INCREASING ANY QUALITY IT'S IMPORTANT THESE WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT HELP THEM MAKE ENDS MEET IN THE CASE TODAY ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THE CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. REPLACES THE PORTION OF WAGES OF WORKERS EARNINGS BOTHER CARING FOR THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH VERY LOW INCOME WORKERS RECEIVE PAYMENTS AS WE HEARD AT 70% EARNINGS. ALL OTHER WORKERS RECEIVE PAYMENTS A 60% OF THE EARNINGS. HOWEVER THE PAYMENT RATE OF SEVENTY PERCENT. ONLY APPLIES TO WORKERS WITH VERY LOW INCOMES ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S AVERAGE WEEKLY WAGE ANNUALLY THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO FOR A BIT OF TEXT A MINIMUM WAGE WORKER IN CALIFORNIA WHO'S WOKING FULL TIME HERE AROUND WOULD MAKE TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR THE HIGHER WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE. WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM THE OTHER STATES WITH PAY FAMILY PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA WHICH IS REPRESENTED WITH THAT ORANGE BAR HAS THE SECOND LOWEST. PAYMENT RATE FOR WORKER MAKING TWELVE DOLLARS PER HOUR. AND TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WORKER WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY PAY LEAVE PAYMENT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS. ON THE OTHER HAND OREGON WHICH IS THE NEW STATE TO ENACT A PALEY PROGRAM THEY'RE GOING TO FULLY REPLACE WAGES FOR LOWER WAGE WORKERS IF ORGANS. LEAVE PROGRAM WERE EFFECTIVE TODAY THAT SAME WORKER MAKING TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WORKING FULL TIME RECEIVE A PAYMENT OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS PER WEEK THAT PAYMENT. SO AS WE KNOW THESE LOW PAYMENTS CAN BE A BARRIER FOR SOME WORKERS AND BOOSTING THE PAYMENT RATE FOR LOWER WAGE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR COULD PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL SECURITY THEY NEED. TO ACCESS OUR PAY FAMILY PROGRAM. SO AS WE'VE ALSO HEARD ANOTHER BARRIER TAXES THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS THE LACK OF JOB PROTECTIONS WHEN WORKERS THE TIME AWAY TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY. SELECT A JOB PROTECTIONS MEANS EMPLOYERS DO NOT HAVE TO GUARANTEE THAT THEIR WORKERS WILL HAVE A JOB WHEN THEY'RE PAID THE PERIOD ENDS. NO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO PROVIDE UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. FOR WHEN WORKERS THE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND WORKERS CAN UTILIZE PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND THIS ON PAID JOB PROTECT YOU'VE AT THE SAME TIME. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. ELIGIBLE FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE MILLIONS OF WORKERS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. DUE TO THE RESTRICTIONS WRITTEN INTO THE LIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY SPEND WITH AN EMPLOYER. AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY'VE WORKED WITH THAT SAME EMPLOYER. SO AS AN EXAMPLE THIS HER SHOWS THAT FOR INTO MARKETING CALIFORNIA OVER SEVEN MILLION WORKERS. EARN A WORKPLACE WITH MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ARE PROTECTED THE YOU'VE TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER AS AN EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION AT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION WORKERS OR ABOUT 8% ARE IN ORDER ISSUE WITH FEWER THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO. THE JOB PROTECTED THE IF. UNDER THE OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. THE WIND ALSO ABOUT WORKERS WITH LOW WAGES ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MULTIPLE PART TIME JOBS WHICH MEANS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR JOB PROTECTED LEAVE UNDER THESE OTHER LIES WHICH MEANS THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE MAY SIMPLY BE OUT FOR EACH FOR THEM. THE CALIFORNIA CANCEL. THEIR STATES IN A CORPORATE JOB PROTECTIONS INTO OUR PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS IS GONNA ALLOW MORE WORKERS TO UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM THAT THEY- MOST CERTAINLY WILL NEED AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER. SO FINALLY POLICYMAKERS CAN MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH TIME WE FROM WORK TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THE CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM PROVIDE SIX WEEKS OF PAID TIME OFF. WE ALL KNOW PROBABLY THAT THIS IS GOING TO EXTEND TO EIGHT WEEKS EFFECTIVE ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER WITHOUT FURTHER ACTION THE DURATION OF LEAVING CALIFORNIA WILL FALL SHORT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND CERTAINLY OTHER NATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE FINAL CHART THE DURATION LEAVE IN STATES WITH A PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. AND IN SIX OF THE NINE STATES WITH THE PAY FAMILY PROGRAM WILL OFFER TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHEN EITHER THEY EITHER EXTEND THEIR EXISTING PROGRAM OR WHEN THEY IMPLEMENT. THEIR NEW PAISLEY PROGRAM. SO EXTENDING THE DURATION OF PAID LEAVE TO TWELVE WEEKS IS JUST ONE MORE STEP TO MAKING SURE. THAT FAMILIES HAVE ENOUGH TIME AND RESOURCES TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. SO WE KNOW THE BRUISING PAID FAMILY LEAVE PAYMENTS PROVIDING JOB PROTECTIONS AND EXTENDING THE DURATION OF LEAF WOULD INCREASE ACCESS. AND UTILIZATION SO THIRD NUMBER WAYS POLICYMAKERS CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SPECIAL FUNDS THE DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND. HAS THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE PALEY BENEFITS. SO CURRENTLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS FUNDED ENTIRELY WITH WORKERS CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS. ONE OPTION IS TO REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PALEY BENEFITS WORKERS BUT ALSO IN BENEFITS EMPLOYERS TO. WE WILL BE ALONE IN THIS FOR THE NINE STATES WITH PAVE THE PROGRAM REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO CONTRIBUTE. ANOTHER OPTION IS TO INCREASE THE TAXABLE WAGE CEILING WORKERS CURRENTLY DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FONG ON EARNINGS OVER ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND IN ANNUAL EARNINGS. FOR STATES HAVE A HIGHER WAGE SO IN CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND IN ANNUAL EARNINGS. AND THEN THE LAST OPTION IS THAT POLICYMAKERS CAN ALSO INCREASE THE CONTRIBUTION RATE FOR THIS RAY UNDER STATE LAW CAN VARY BETWEEN. ON POINT TWENTY NINETEEN BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT INCREASING THE CONTRIBUTION RATE WITH YOUR GRASS. AND BUT HER LOWER WAGE WERE MORE. AND THE THEY CAN LEAST AFFORD LARGE. FROM THEIR PAYCHECK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELPFUL AND I THINK THE FACT THAT- WE HAVE TO KEEP EMPHASIZING THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THE EMPLOYERS WELL- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING THAT I DID WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT- TO THE DIRECTOR HAD THINGS COMMENTS ABOUT THE- FIRST DAUGHTER WHATEVER HER TITLE IS THAT HER PROPOSAL IS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO RAID THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY TO PAY FOR FAMILY LEAVE AND I HOPE WE DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THAT. NOTION THE ALREADY OF BEING THAT SAFE. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE RESERVE SOMEWHAT OF A FULL. ON THIS ISSUE- THAT KIND OF AN APPROACH I THINK WOULD BE TERRIBLY. REGRESSIVE AS YOU POLITELY PUT IT SO- I AGREE THIS IS A NON PARTISAN ISSUE. PEOPLE WHO VOTE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER STILL HAVE THE SAME FAMILY ISSUES TO ATTEND TO AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. DO WITHOUT WITHOUT REALLY PUTTING FAMILIES AT RISK AND PUNISHING THEM WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT WE DO. IF WE START TAKING MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETS AND SO I JUST WANTED TO. SENATOR IF I MAY APOLOGIZE IF I SEEM TO AND FOR THAT- THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- THE POLICIES THAT ARE OUT THERE. ARE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER IN AS MUCH AS- THAT WE HAVE THE BEST A POLICY CURRENTLY- IN ALL THE STATES- AND STILL COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER HERE. I UST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CLARIFY BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE REALLY WANT I PART IN NONPARTISAN ON THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF PROPOSAL'S LITERATURE THE SITE TO ME. PROBABLY TO THE PROCESS NON STARTERS SO BUT THANK YOU ARE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THEM INFORMATIVE OF PRESENTATION AND IT DID COME IN UNDER. EIGHT MINUTES BY THE WAY JUST. THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE THAT WITH YOU. ALL RIGHT AND- WE NEXT HAVE- LEADING EXPERT ON THE BENEFITS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE WITH AN ACUTE UNDERSTANDING OF CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM DOCTOR JANICE STERN'S FROM. UC DAVIS I WAS A- DOCTOR. YES IT'S WONDERFUL THAT. TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU FOR- YOUR- BEING WITH US TODAY. YOU THINK YEAH- SO I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT OF ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. AND MY RESEARH FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE ANOTHER SOCIAL INSURANCE POLICIES ON LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES AND HEALTH. SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF. PAID FAMILY LEAVE TODAY I WANTED TO START BY JUST. A POINT THAT SENATOR JACKSON BROUGHT UP EARLIER WHICH IS NOW TODAY IN THE UNITED. RENTS AND MOST MOTHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN NOW WORK OUT SIDE OF THE HOME AND SO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN IN A AN ACT POLICIES THAT HELP BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN WORK AND STARTING A NEW FAMILY OR BRINGING NEW LIFE INTO THE HOUSEHOLD ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IT ABSENCE OF A PAID FAMILY LEAVE YES ACCESS TO EMPLOYER PROVIDED PAID LEAVE IN THE UNITED STATES INCREDIBLY LOW AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE LOW RATE OVERALL IS THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF IN EQUITY IN ACCESS TO EMPLOYER PROVIDED LEAVE ONLY ABOUT 9% OF WORKERS IN THE BOTTOM 25% OF THE WAGE DISTRIBUTION HAVE ACCESS TO EMPLOYER PROVIDED THESE BENEFITS. COMPARED ABOUT THIRTY IN THE TOP 25% WHICH- AND SO POLICIES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA'S CAN HAVE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION OF CONSEQUENCES ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF BENEFITS. I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST VERY BRIEF. THE BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN OTHER PROGRAMS ON. HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES IN A MINISTER WITH EVIDENCE ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAS UNAMBIGUOUS UNAMBIGUOUSLY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN THE- AT THE TIME THEY'RE BORN IN PERSISTING LEADER IN LIFE. SO IN THE SHORT RUN- SOME WORK THAT I'VE DONE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM AND OTHER STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAMS HAS SHOWN THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE. THE ACTUALLY IMPROVED INTENT HEALTH AT BIRTH- SO THIS FIGURE HERE SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SHARE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTHS IN THE STATE. THAT LIMIT OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE THROUGH THEIR BILL THE INTERNS. IN THE SOUL. COMPARED TO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT RATE IN STATES THAT DID NOT IN THAT DASHLANE YOU CAN SEE. AS SOON AS PAID MATERNITY LEAVE- BECAME AVAILABLE THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE SHARE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTH WE ALSO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER MEASURES OF INFANT. BIRTH WE ALSO KNOW FROM THAT PRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT THE ACCESS TO UNPAID LEAVE ALSO IMPROVES BIRTH OUTCOMES. BUT ONE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION I THINK IS THAT- WHEN WE PROVIDE ACCESS TO UNPAID LEAVE BENEFITS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER AMONG MORE ADVANTAGE HIGHER SKILLED WORKERS WHEREAS WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THESE. PAID MATERNITY PROGRAMS WE SAW RELATIVELY LARGER BENEFITS AMONG THE LOWER SKILLED LESS ADVANTAGED WORKER. AND SO HE LEAVE MAY HAVE VERY IMPORTANT EQUITY IMPLICATIONS IN THAT REGARD. CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR ALSO HAS BEEN SHIPPED TO HAVE A FAX ONE INFANT HEALTH WE SEE INCREASES IN- THE AMOUNT OF TIME MOTHER SPEND BREAST FEEDING WITH THEM FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE. A DECREASE IN THE PROBABILITY THAT INFANTS ARE HOSPITALIZED DUE TO SEVERE. ILLNESS OR INFECTION AND A DECREASE IN THE LEAGUE VACCINATION RATES SO INFANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ON THE RECOMMENDED ROUTINE VACCINATION SCHEDULE THAT NOT ONLY HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS. CARRY ON LONGER AND LIFE A NEW WORKING A NEW PAPER SHOWS THAT. INFANTS EXPOSED TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAVE IMPROVED HEALTH IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH A LOWER- PROBABILITY OF. BEING OVER WEIGHT- LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HEARING PROBLEMS AND ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BE A NOTE DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD. EACH OF THESE HEALTH OUTCOMES- IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH THE SHORT RUN DEFECTS AND HEALTH THAT WE SEE PRIMARILY THROUGH BREAST FEEDING AND- A DECREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF ILLNESS AS A AS A- CHILD. WE ALSO SEE THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE INCREASES PARENTAL TIME IN CHILD CARE WHICH HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND THIS IS NOT FROM THE UNITED STATES BUT THE INTRODUCTION OF PAID MATERNITY LEAVE IN NORWAY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS BEEN SHOWN. TO ACTUALLY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS ON THE LONG TERM EARNINGS OF THE CHILDREN EXPOSED TO THAT LEAVES. OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S POLICY IS NOT YET OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK AT LONG TERM IMPACTS ON ADULT EARNINGS BUT THERE MAY BE ON REALIZE BENEFITS IN A FORMAT THAT WE- CAN'T MEASURE YET. FAMILY LEAVE ALTHOUGH HAS AFFECTS ON MATERNAL HEALTH. BEING MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS HYSICAL HEALTH EVIDENCE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES SHOWS THAT PAID MATERNITY LEAVE DECREASES THE NUMBER OF INPATIENT HOSPITAL STAY IS AMONG MOTHERS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CHILD'S LIFE THREE DECREASE IN PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATIONS SO PAID LEAVE IS CRITICAL FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE MOTHER AS WELL NOT ONLY FOR BONDING WITH A NEW CHILD. AND FINALLY ONE REALLY INTERESTING PIECE OF NEW RESEARCH BY ONE OF MY CO AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT- PAID PATERNITY LEAVE A AND THE STUDY IS FROM SWEDEN WHEN FATHERS CAN TAKE MORE TIME OFF IT ACTUALLY IMPROVES MOTHER'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AS WELL THE MOTHERS BENEFITS NOT ON A FROM TIME AT HOME TO RECOVER FROM CHILD BIRTH ONE OF THEIR CHILD BUT ALSO FROM THIS SUPPORT NETWORK THAT THEY GET. WHEN A- PARENT UP THERE CAN. THERE ARE QUITE A BIT OF EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE ON LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES- THERE IS RATHER MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE FX ON LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE TRAJECTORIES OF MOTHERS. SEVERAL PAPER SHALL WHEN LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE OVER KIND OF A LONGER HER RISE THEN THAT THERE ARE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND SMALL POSITIVE EFFECTS ON WAGES. HOWEVER A NEW RECENT WORKING PAPER THAT USES FEDERAL TAX DATA SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS ASSOCIATED WITH- NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. ONE IMPORTANT CAVEAT I THINK THAT MAY EXPLAIN PART OF THOSE DIFFERENCES THIS THAT IS. IS THAT THIS NEW PAPER- ONLY LOOKS AT AT MOTHER'S TO CLEAN IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER THAT IT BECAME AVAILABLE WHO GAVE BIRTH MADE A CLAIM. IN JULY. SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FOUR YOU MIGHT THINK THERE ISN'T BELIEVE. EITHER THE MOTHER OR TO LOOK UP LEAVE AS SOON AS IT BECAME OF IT. A WOULD BE SELECTED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE AVERAGE MOTHER WHO CLAIMS TODAY OR THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENTIAL- COSTS ARE STIGMAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAVE WHEN IT WAS VERY FIRST INTRODUCED AS OPPOSED TO TODAY- SO THAT'S JUST ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT THAT RESULT. WE DON'T SEE ANY OF A FAN- AVENUE ANY EVIDENCE OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS- ON EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES OUR FATHERS BUT I WILL EMPHASIZE TAKE UP IS QUITE LOW SO IT'S MUCH HARDER TO IDENTIFY THE FACTS. THE DURATION OF LEAVE THAT FATHERS TAKE EVEN WHEN THEY TAKE IT IS SO MUCH SHORTER THAN IT IS FOR MOTHERS. AND FINALLY WE'RE QUITE WORRIED ABOUT AFFECTS ON FIRM- I THINK THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST NON NEGATIVE UP- AFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OR WAGE COSTS THAT FIRMS FACE QUITE A BIT OF SURVEY EVIDENCE. EXISTS NOW BUT SUGGEST THAT FIRMS DO NOT VIEW THESE POLICIES THAT'S COST AT LEAST ONCE THEY'VE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED. THIS YEAR IS ACTION FROM CALIFORNIA- USING A MINUTE STRAIGHT OF DATA AND SHOWS- IT JUST ON THE LEFT ACCESS IN THE BLUE LINE- THE PER EMPLOYEE WAGE COSTS OF EMPLOYERS ON AVERAGE PLOTTED AGAINST THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE TAKE UP RATES THE RED LINE IS- FOR MOTHERS. AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE THAT WE EACH COST. INCREASE WHEN. IF INTER. FINALLY ALL AND JUST TALKING A BIT ABOUT SOME OF MY- NEW RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT. HIGHER QUALITY FIRMS HAVE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER CLEAN RATES THAN LOWER QUALITY FIRMS AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OVERALL I THINK PAID FAMILY LEAVE APPEARS TO HAVE A QUITE HIGH BENEFITS COMPARED TO ITS COST. BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER IN THINKING ABOUT BARRIERS TO TAKE UP AN EQUITY IN ACCESS TO THIS LEAVE. MY WORK ON FIRM QUALITY SUGGEST THAT NOT ONLY DO HIGHER QUALITY FIRMS HIRE LEAVE TAKING RATES IN GENERAL. BUT THERE ARE BETTER ABLE TO GET RID OF SOME OF THIS INEQUALITY IN ACCESS OF BY- WORKER- INCOME LEVEL OR WORKER EARNINGS. SO WHAT THIS FIGURE SHOWS IN THE BLUE BARS IS THE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS BY WORKERS IN SCHOOL TELL EACH DISTRIBUTION SO ONE OF THE LOWEST EARNERS AND FOUR IS THE HIGHEST EARNERS BY FIRM. AND THE RED BAR SHOW HOW MUCH THE CLEAN- THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN THE FIRM FOR EACH OF THESE GROUPS WOULD GO UP. IF WE MOVED ALL FIRMS TO BEING ONE STANDARD DEVIATION HIGHER QUALITY AND SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS AGAIN NOT ONLY ARE THE CLAIM RATES FOR BETTER QUALITY FIRMS MUCH HIGHER. BUT YOU GET RID OF A LOT OF THE INEQUALITY IN ACCESS PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE LOWEST EARNING WORKERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS A SHOULD BE TIME FOR QUESTIONS ON THIS FIRST PANEL IF ANYONE HAS ONE. BUT WE SIR WITH THE. I HAVE A FOR SURE THIS OF. CONVENING IS AN IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO KNOW LIKE ALL THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BUT- YOU KNOW WE- WE OBVIOUSLY ARE TRYING TO GET TO TWELVE. WEEKS IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE- ANY OUT OF THAT SUGGEST WHAT THE ACTUAL IDEAL TIME AS I'M ASSUME THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S- GOT TO BE. IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN TWELVE WEEKS DEFINITELY MORE THAN WE HAVE NOW SIX WEEKS EIGHT WEEKS. BUT AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW WOMEN WHO WANT TO REENTER THE ROOM FOR SOME STUFF IS THERE ANY STUDY THAT SUGGESTS WITH THAT IDEAL TIME AS- THERE IS NOT A STUDY THAT KIND OF CONCLUSIVELY SUGGESTS WHAT AN IDEAL. STATION IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. A POSITIVE HELD A FAX EMERGE FAIRLY EARLY- BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T BIGGER HEALTH EFFECTS IF YOU EXTEND. LEAVE LONGER IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT WHAT WE KNOW FROM EUROPE- SO TAKE THIS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES OF PARTICULARLY THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT DIRECTLY COMPATIBLE IN MANY OTHER. WAYS BUT- WHAT WE SEE FROM EUROPE IS THAT LEAVES LONGER THAN ABOUT A YEAR. START TO HAVE NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT CONSEQUENCE. WHERE LEAVE SHORTER IN THE YEAR IN GENERAL DO NOT HAVE NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT. QUINCES ARE LARGE COSTS ON FIRMS TO THE BEST THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY. IN THAT RANGE FROM ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO A YEAR WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE IDEAL LIFE AND NOT. AND ONE MORE QUESTION SURE IT'S OKAY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WAGE CEILING ON WHAT THE ONE HURT OR WHAT 1% WE'LL CALL IT I KNOW THERE'S- 10% THE ONLY WAY AND THAT- THAT WE'RE GIVING AT THAT WE'RE TAKING FROM PEOPLE'S PAYCHECK BASICALLY TO FUND THIS PROGRAM CALIFORNIA'S THAT YOU SAID ABOUT ONE EIGHTEEN SOME STATES GO UP TO ONE THIRTY THREE IS THAT THE HIGHEST HAS ANYONE SUGGESTED. I MEAN IF YOU WANT A PROGRESSIVE APPROACH THAT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD GO TO ONE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WITHOUT MUCH OF FACT WRECKED SO I WOULD KNOW THAT THE DESERT OF COLUMBIA IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT HAVE A WAGE CEILING. ON THEIR PROGRAM AND THEN THE STATE'S WITH ONE THIRTY THREE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE UNTOUCHABLE WAGE BASE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. SO SOME STATES HAVE JUST PASTED ACTION UP WITH ADEQUATE. THAT WILL NOTE THAT THE GOVERNORS OF. COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUE HAS BROUGHT UP THIS ISSUE AND TAKING A LOOK LOOK AT IT. THEIR FORTUNES SIDE OF HIS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WORKERS UP IN THAT STRATA. AND SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S COLLECTED HE DOESN'T. PAY FOR A WHOLE LOT OF BENEFIT. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND MADAM CHAIR FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING AND I THINK THIS IS MY SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A SELECT COMMITTEE AND GREAT TO BE HERE IN MY DISTRICT AND SEE MY CONSTITUENTS THAT TESTIFYING US OF UP AND SINGER OUR DOCTOR FROM UC DAVIS THE BIG PICTURE I'M OF OPTICS SUPPORTER OF THIS AS YOU SAID IT'S YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. BENEFICIAL TO- FAMILIES AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND THE WORK FORCE I THINK A STABLE WORKFORCE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY TALK ABOUT TOO MUCH BUT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR EMPLOYERS TO GET ON STAY ON IT SO HAVING A STABLE WORKFORCE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO I GET ALL THAT THANKS FOR LETTING US OF A I HAVE TWO ISSUES I WANT TO FOCUS ON SO FIRST. THE STATE IT SAID THIS IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE. SO YOU. STATE OVERSEAS AT. THE SAME BENEFITS ARE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND THE PUBLIC- HAS THIS. WE KNOW THAT STATE AGENCIES. VERY FEW PEOPLE HERE IN THE CAPITAL KNOW THAT THE STATE SENATE'S LIKE THE ENVY OF. STATE WORKFORCE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BENEFICIAL TO BE YES. STATE SENATOR STATE ASSEMBLY LEGISLATIVE STAFF MEMBER. THE TIME YOU HAVE TO. BOND WITH YOUR NEWBORN VERY VERY GENEROUS. SO WHAT HAS THE STATE DOWN TO YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT HAS PLENTY OF STATE WORKERS. YOU KNOW. TENS OF THOUSANDS SO WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. SOME UNIFORMITY IN THAT AMONG THE STATE AGENCIES. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. AS WE LOOK AT. EXPANSION AND FOR ALL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WHAT TIMES. PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU PASSED LAWS IN PASSED UPON NOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING CALIFORNIA.TO STEP IT UP AND BY EXAMPLE. SOME COULD DRESS UP PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. LOW ONE THOUSAND BARGAIN FOR- THE RIGHT TO STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE UNPAID LEAVE US AN EXTENSION OF THAT. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT YEAR- AND THAT CONCLUDES THE- VAST MAJORITY OF STATE EMPLOYEES THERE OTHER BARGAINING UNITS WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT. I THAT HAVE NOT BARGAINED FOR- THAT BENEFIT- AND SO THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE BENEFIT- WHAT I WILL TELL YOU CONTRACT ISSUE NOT A- STATE POLICY EXACTLY RIGHT IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS- ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO BARGAIN. OF FOR THAT I THINK THAT THERE WAS A LEGISLATION. EARLIER LAST EARLIER THIS YEAR- THAT SPOKE TO TEACHERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO GOT IT AND IT'S LEFT OPEN TO- THEIR BARGAINING ABILITY- TO REAP BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT BENEFIT. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL I'M EXCITED TO SAY THAT- STATE SUPERVISORS FINALLY HAVE A NOT EXACTLY- WHAT- STI AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROVIDE- BUT WERE NOW- SUPERVISORS ABLE TO GET- AT LEAST PARTIAL WAGE REPLACEMENT FOR TIME OFF. OF FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO WE HAVE TAKEN JUST RECENTLY SOME STEPS TOWARDS A- BUT IT'S A VERY MUCH LEFT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL BARGAINING UNITS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE WORKERS- ON HOW THEY WANT TO- READ WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT OR NOT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO FORD WE WEREN'T THE LEADER IN THIS AND AS YOU SEE FROM THE CHART. OTHER STATES HAVE HAVE STEPPED UP AND SURPASSED OUR OUR OUR TIME FRAME THERE WE HAVE LEGISLATORS PUSH THE ENVELOPE FOR ALL ALL ALL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO HAVE WE EVER AS A STATE THOUGHT ABOUT HEY WELL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU COULD DO A BILL INSIDE SOMETHING A LOT STATUE THAT. EVERYBODY BUT WHAT ABOUT. THE STATE WORK FORCE HAS THAT EVER BEEN ON THE TABLE. I HAVE I DO NOT KNOW OF A- SINGLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT'S BEEN ON- THE TABLE. OF BECAUSE IT'S A BARGAIN MOBILE RIGHT I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT- UNION- RIGHTS AND- RIGHT AROUND WHAT IS COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WHAT IS NOT COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN- BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT WHILE DURATION IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT GOES INTO THIS BENEFIT. THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER. PARTS AND PARCELS AGAIN A STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE IS A FIFTY TWO WEEK LONG TEMPORARY DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS. AND WHILE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE. FUNDING IS USE FOR BIRTH MOTHERS- GENERALLY AFTER ABOUT TEN WEEKS BUT CAN BE USE FOR MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT'S A MUCH BETTER BENEFIT- THEN I. THINK JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER STATE THAT I'VE SEEN. SO WHEN. LOOKING AT THIS BENEFIT IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO- CHILDBIRTH I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK- AS RIGHTLY POSED BY THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS- A SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS TESTIFYING. THAT YOU LOOK AT OTHER THINGS SUCH AS- THE WORKERS RIGHT AROUND IT- AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU RECEIVE ANOTHER- BENEFITS THAT ARE SOON. AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN USE IT. AND IF IT THE TORAH WITH THE COMMITTEE- DOCTOR STERN BROUGHT UP ONE ISSUE AROUND A PARTICULARLY WOMEN RETURNING TO THE WORK PLACE THAT I. I'D LIKE TO JUST PUT AN UNDERLINED AND- IN OUR SOCIETY IN THE UNITED STATES WE HAVE MORE WOMEN THAN EVER. THAT ARE PHD IS WE HAVE A HIGHER ACCEPTANCE RATE AMONG WOMEN THAN THAT. BUT THESE ARE THE EXACT TYPES OF PEOPLE ONLY TALK ABOUT OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SOCIETY. WE WANT TO ENSURE DON'T HAVE THAT LARGE BREAK- WHEN IT COMES TO. OF THE ECONOMY BECAUSE JUST AS THE DOCTOR SAID WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK. AND WE FEEL THEIR FULL ECONOMIC FRUITION- IN OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU THEN CHRIS AND I HAVE A QUESTION A MONDAY THE STATE'S THE TO GO TO TWELVE YES WELL WEEKS. IS THAT IS AS A UNIFORM AND HOW THAT'S. PAID FOR ABOVE AND BEYOND WE DO AS FAR AS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT PAYROLL TAX VERSES. HE HE IN THE PLAYER TAX VERSES THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE THIS IS STATE. PAY SOME OF THAT TOO WHEN THEY DID THE EXPANSION SO IT REALLY VARIES BY STATE BUT IT'S EITHER ALL EMPLOYEE FUNDED LIKE CALIFORNIA OR COMBINATION OF EMPLOYEE AND- EMPLOYER FUNDED PROGRAMS. AND IS THE STATE ANY OTHER STATES STEP UP AND DEPEND ON THEIR GENERAL FUND IT'S ALL BASED UPON THE MODEL FOR THE. BASICALLY YES BUT THIS WOMAN IN A- DESOLATE DIDN'T DIDN'T SAY WE DID RECEIVEADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND TO DO THE OUTRAGE. AND THAT'S THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS NIGHT OF MONEY COMING OUT OF. TO BE CLEAR IT IS THIS AD IN RESPONSE THAT LAST QUESTION. IS THE MONEY DOES THE MONEY COME FROM STATE GENERAL FUNDS WERE EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS EMPLOYEES SO WHEN SPEAKING OF A BENEFITS SPECIFICALLY NOT SO MUCH FOR OUT RETURN MINISTRATION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM EITHER EMPLOYEES ONLY OR ALSO EMPLOYEES. AND EMPLOYERS DEPENDING ON THE STATE. AND THEN LASTLY THAT THE TAKE OPERATE FOR EITHER. THE DOCTOR THE ADMISSIONS TO AS FAR AS PEOPLE ON LOW WAGE POSITIONS WHO ARE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR IF YOU HAVE A FULL TIME JOB FOR THE STATE TO WORK FOR. IN OUR BUSINESS ARE COMING FROM WHAT HAVE YOU BUT- SOME OF THE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. LOW WEIGHTS NOT QUITE FULL TIME MULTIPLE JOBS AND SO. IS IT JUST REALLY COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS IT. IS IT. YOU'RE NOT. A UNIFORM IN THAT. IN THE- APPLICABILITY OF THAT. THERE IS DIFFERENT PARTICIPATION RATES AS YOU AS WE SAW RIGHT SO HOW DO WE ATTRIBUTE THAT AND WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT. WHAT A MARKET RESEARCH REPORT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE PLYMOUTH DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT MANY. WORKERS INDICATED THAT JOB PROTECTIONS FOR A BARRIER TO ACCESSING PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AS WELL AS THE WAY TO PLACEMENT RATES NOW THIS REPORT WAS DONE. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND IT WAS DONE ACTUALLY BEFORE WE BOOSTED THE RATES FOR VERY LOW WAGE WORKERS. AS THE DIRECTOR IT INDICATED WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE AND TAKE UP RATES- SO I THINK THOSE TWO BARRIERS ARE VERY. THE VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHEN THINKING ABOUT LOWER WAGE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR THEY ALSO THINK. JOB PROTECTIONS AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FOUR. LAWS UNDER WHICH A WORKER COULD HAVE JOB PROTECTED LEAVE IS PROBABLY REALLY CONFUSING FOR EVERY WORKER. AND OFTEN TIMES EVERY LEGISLATORS AT WHAT EXACTLY I WOULD NOTE THAT THAT WE HAVE A TABLE IN THE REPORT THAT TRIES TO LAY OUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THOSE THINK SENDING. AN ASTRONAUT TO THE MOON HAD A SIMPLER FLOW CHART THEN ARE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO NOTE. **** THOUGHT THAT- WE CONSISTENTLY MOVE UP THE MINIMUM WAGE IN AND WE ARE WORKING TO GET IT TO A LIVABLE WAGE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN LEVEL ONCE WE- REACH FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT- TO SUGGESTED A SINGLE MOM WHO MAKES MINIMUM WAGE CAN SUDDENLY LIVE. IN A MORE EXPENSIVE TIME WITH THE CHILD WE ALL KNOW THE COST OF CHILDREN I DON'T GET ME STARTED DIAPERS. YOU WERE ASKING HER TO LIVE ON 70% OF OUR SALARY HAPPENING. IT'S JUST NOT. LIKE A LOT OF US SO I AND I WOULD BE INTERESTED IF I MAKE. THE STUDIES INDICATED THEIR THEIR- OLDER STUDIES WHILE AGAIN. RACHEL PROVING AND- THE MORE CHOP PROTECTION I THINK DOES HELP BUT WITHOUT IT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR OUR LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO CAN BARELY MAKE IT ON WHAT THEY'VE GOT CLEARLY WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE. AT WHEN I CAN SEE THE KIND OF- ADJUSTMENTS IN ACCESSING THIS NOW THAT IS THOUGH. PRIMARILY FOR- PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOR NEWBORNS IN CARING FOR YOUNG ONES. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME SPEAK ON CARING FOR FAMILY MEMBERS BUT I'D LIKE IF YOU WILL. IF YOU DONE ANY RESEARCH ON THIS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THEIR AGING OR AGING STATE- AS SOME OF US. ARE AGING. NOT ALL OF US BUT SOME OF US WITH GRAY HAIR RECOGNIZING LOOKING IN A MIRROR SOMEDAY THAT BE ME AND THAT SOMEDAY COULD BE. RATHER THAN. THAT BEING SAID- WE DON'T YOU KNOW OUR OUR CARE FOR SENIORS IS APPALLING CAR NURSING HOMES AND OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE NEED CARE. SO WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS HOW WE GONNA DO THAT. AND STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR- OF ABILITY TO CARE FOR OURSELVES AND PUT FOOD ON THE TABLES FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES. WHAT WHAT IS THIS LOOK LIKE FOR THEM. SENATOR I APPRECIATED IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE A SHAMELESS PLUG FOR THE GOVERNOR I'M VERY HONORED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO. WORK ON THIS PROGRAM- AND SERVE GOVERNOR NEWSOME AS HE TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES YESTERDAY HE JUST A- LARGE HEARING ON ALZHEIMER'S ONE OF THE- RESULT OF SOME OF THE AGENT. WHAT WE SEE- DIFFERENT FROM- PAID FAMILY FOR BABY BONDING- IS THAT- FOLKS THAT UTILIZES BENEFIT OR USE AYE UTILIZING IT MUCH DIFFERENT- IN SO INSTEAD OF. A CONSISTENT PATTERN OVER A FOUR WEEKS JUST YOU HAVE A SOLID FOUR WEEKS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS. OF PEOPLE TAKING ONE DAY HERE ONE DAY THERE AND- AND A TOTALLY WHAT WE'RE TOLD IS BECAUSE THAT'S DIFFERENT APPOINTMENTS AS PEOPLE- ACCESS DIFFERENT PARTS OF CARE- IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF LIFE OR FRANKLY- LIFETIME MOMENTS- IN OUR- CAMPAIGN AND OUTREACH EFFORTS WE ARE. DEFINITELY NOT LEAVING THAT'LL ON- I THINK IT IS I'M LOOKING AT YOUR CHICHI THERE BUT I THINK IT'S RHODE ISLAND- WHO REALLY FOCUSED ON ELDER CARE. OF FROM THE START OF THEIR PROGRAM- FRANKLY I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LACK FUND WE HAD TO DO- FOR OUTRAGE WE REACHED OUT TO A LOT OF THE HOSPITALS TALK TO THEM ABOUT. BENEFIT TO- NEW PERSON FATHER'S. INITIALLY UP BUTTON HONESTLY. I TO TAKE IT APART. THE OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATED TO THE DEPARTMENT MOVING FORWARD. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AND- I'LL REACH. TWO TYPICALLY TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE CARE AND MAKE. SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THAT'S THERE pOF THOSE GROUPS BECAUSE THERE AREN'TAS MANY FRANKLY AS ESTABLISHED AS I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE. A RP DOES A WONDERFUL JOB AND THEY ARE A GOOD PARTNER IN BUT IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO PIN DOWN THE ADVOCACY GROUPS- FOR PEOPLE LOOKING OF CARE BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT- WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING TO INCREASE THE UTILIZATION AROUND. WELL AS THE AUTHOR THE BILL TO EXPAND NEW BABY BONDING I HOPE THAT WE ARE GOING TO ROB FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DO THESE PROGRAMS- COLLABORATIVELY AND NOT. START COMPETING FOR THOSE DOLLARS SO- I'M WONDERING ARE THERE IT TO ARE THERE ANY STATISTICS ON THE IMPACTS OF CARING FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. ON EMPLOYMENT ON EMPLOYEES VERSUS EMPLOYERS IN TERMS OF. THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO EARN SUFFICIENT FUNDS THE- EMPLOYERS HAVING EMPLOYEES WHO WERE TAKING THAT KIND OF TIME OFFICER BEEN ANY DATA IS FOR ANY. ANY ANY STUDY DONE ON THIS ISSUE. I DON'T BELIEVE SO AT THIS POINT BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT- I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO- ASK MISTER WASHINGTON COULD BUT TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE SENATOR OR THE COMMITTEE IF YOU FALL PLEASE- ON OUR- RATES AND THE DATA THAT WE DO COLLECT AROUND BOND- SKEWS ME CARE GIVER. I JUST THINK AGAIN WITH CALIFORNIA AGING AS IT IS. WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC FOR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOU MENTION ARE PHD IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE FAMILIES. AND WE OF WOMEN FOR PRIMARILY HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS AND TAKEN THE ROLE OF CARE GIVER AND- WE DON'T WANT- IT AGAIN FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE TO MAKE THESE VERY VERY DIFFICULT HOBSON'S CHOICES. SOPHIE'S CHOICE IS ACTUALLY ON HOW TO CARE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO BE GOOD EMPLOYEES AND GOOD WORKERS AND- SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR CAREERS SO. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE INITIAL- ON AUTHOR OF SENATOR KEWL. SUPERVISOR COOL- DESIGNED FOR THE PROGRAM FOR IS THIS NOT JUST FOR ONE INSTANCE IN LIFE- BUT IT IS FOR A LIFETIME. OF IN INCIDENCES AND IT IS A- IN INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM FOR WORKERS. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD DISTINCTION I DO HAVE A WONDER TO OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE BENEFITS OF FAMILY LEAVE WHETHER IT'S FOR CARE GIVING FOR SENIORS WHETHER TO BABY PLANNING I'M WONDERING ARE YOU SEEING MORE EMPLOYERS OFFERING THESE KINDS OF FAMILY THE BENEFITS ON THEIR OWN- OR IN ADDITION TO WHAT CALIFORNIA PROVIDES IN COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN OR WHAT IS INSPIRED THEM TO DO THIS. ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO CALIFORNIA HERE'S AS SPECIFICALLY BUT OVERALL- IN THE U. S. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. EMPLOYER PROVIDED PAID FAMILY LEAVE HAS GONE UP CONSIDERABLY IT'S STILL QUITE LOW- TODAY ABOUT 20% OF ALL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER. EMPLOYER PROVIDED MATERNITY OR PATERNITY LEAVE. CHARLES WHAT PROVIDED EMPLOYER EMPLOYER PROVIDED YES- SO THAT'S GONE UP FROM LIKE TWELVE PERCENT- YOU KNOW A DECADE AGO SO IT'S A BIG INCREASE BUT IT'S STILL QUITE LOW- IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS ARE ALLOWED TO TOP OFF YOUR- YOUR WAGE REPLACEMENT THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE'S NO GOOD DATA ON HOW MANY- HOW MANY EMPLOYERS CHOOSE TO DO THAT OR YOU SAY OP OFF WHAT IS THAT MEANS SO- CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM WILL PAY EMPLOYER CAN TOP THAT UP TO A YOU CAN'T BE PAID- MORE THAN YOU WOULD BE IF YOU WERE JUST OUT WORK BUT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO IT TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE- MAYBE YOU KNOW BACK. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ON ON HOW COMMON THAT IS. I WOULD SAY IT'S LOW INCOME AND WE DO HAVE SOME SELF INSURANCE. OF PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU STATISTICS ON IT IS A VERY LOW NUMBER THE COST OF INSURANCE IS- OFTENTIMES VERY HIGH BECAUSE THE- THE AS I DESCRIBE THE PROGRAM IS AN INSURANCE PROGRAM SO THE POOL. IS A LOT SMALLER SO THE RISK IS A LOT HIGHER OF FOR THOSE COMPANIES BUT WE DO HAVE AND KEEP RECORDS OF THOSE. COMPANIES I'D BE REMISS IF I DID NOT KNOW THAT- I BELIEVE LA CITY IS ON ITS WAY TO BUT SAN FRANCISCO- CITY DID PASS AN ORDINANCE ALLOWING FOR. I BELIEVE IT'S UP 290% OF WAIT REPLACEMENT- THAT THE- CITY MANDATES ALL EMPLOYERS MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE FOR. OKAY WELL A LAST QUESTION- AND THAT REALLY NEED TO DO BETTER FEW. XIN OF HOW WE COULD GO ABOUT BOTH FOR- NEW BOOK NEW IN A BABY BONDING AND AS WELL AS FAMILY LEAVE A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE DISCUSSED WERE SOME OF THE OPTIONS AN EMPLOYER CON CONTRIBUTED FUND WHICH FOR STATES TO TAXABLE WAGE FUND INCREASED THE UPPER LEVELS BUT IS POINTED OUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING A THAT OF- INCOME THAT. WOULD CONTRIBUTE AND THEN. AGAIN THE INCREASING CONTRIBUTION RATE WHICH IS FOR AGGRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY UNDERMINE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FOR A PARTICULAR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE SO. ARE ANY INCENTIVES THAT WE COULD DO FOR EMPLOYERS TO GET THEM ON BOARD. IN A WE CAN THERE'S AN EASY WAY AND HARD WAY TO DO THIS AND TO- OBVIOUSLY EMPLOYERS ARE NOT. SEEING OR YOU KNOW NEED TO DO MORE AND DO BETER TO SEE THE BENEFITS MAYBE WE NEED TO DO BETTER TO. SHOW THEM WHAT THOSE BENEFITS ARE- BUT BUT ARE THERE ANY SOLUTION SO YOU CAN SEE AND CAN SUGGEST. SO I THINK. THINKING ABOUT WHAT FIRMS ARE DOING OR WHAT FIRMS ARE NOT DOING IN ENCOURAGING LEAVE TAKING AND WHAT BENEFITS THEY'RE INDEPENDENTLY PROVIDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT I HAVE TO SAY FROM A RESEARCH STANDPOINT WE JUST DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT THESE GOOD FIRMS ARE DOING OR THESE HIGH TAKE UP FIRMS ARE DOING. BUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING ABOUT NOT ONLY CAN WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE THESE THESE PROGRAMS MORE SUSTAINABLE IN TERMS OF COST BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT- ACT SO EVEN IF WE HAVE JOB PROTECTION EAT IF WE HAVE A REPLACEMENT RATE. IF EMPLOYER MAKES IT DIFFICULT. TO TAKE EITHER THROUGH- YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SIGNED A BAD SCHEDULE OR YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PROMOTED OR- YOU KNOW TECHNICALLY I CAN'T FIRE YOU BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT REALLY UNPLEASANT FOR YOU TO COME BACK TO WORK. IF THESE SORTS OF THINGS ARE OF CONCERN TO WORKERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE IT TAKE UP RATES THAT- ARE COMPATIBLE TO WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT. FROM OTHER- OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM EMPLOYERS THAT WE KNOW ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ON WORK FAMILY BALANCE NOW WE SEE A LOT OF LARGE EMPLOYERS. THAT ARE REALLY USING THAT EXISTENCE A VERY GENEROUS PAID PARENTAL LEAVE PROGRAMS- AND OTHER PAID LEAVE FAMILY FRIENDLY PROGRAMS AS A WAY TO RECRUIT HIGH QUALITY HIGH SKILLED WORKERS. AND ALSO AS A WAY TO CREATE A POSITIVE IMAGE WITH THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL AS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS RISES. BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY RESEARCH ON THAT BUT WE'RE JUST KIND OF STARTING TO TRY AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC ASPECTS ABOUT WHAT FIRMS ARE DOING I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. AGAIN AGAIN AS YOU SAY IF COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY'LL MAKE LIKE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYEES AND THE- BLESSING OF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO WHEN THEY'RE COMING BACK FROM A- PERIOD OF LEAVE IS TO BE GIVEN A PINK SLIP THE DAY THEY COME BACK AND IT'S A FEAR THAT. WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE AND- RIGHTLY SO- SO. I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT IT DOES. IT'S A WIN WIN- BUT IT WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SOME HOUSE SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST AN ANECDOTAL AS I MENTIONED MY- MY FRIENDS OVER PATAGONIA THEIR OTHER COMPANIES I'M SURE TO DO THIS. BUT THE YOU KNOW LEADING BY EXAMPLE IN IN DEMONSTRATING THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE I THINK WOULD BE. OF CRITICAL VALUE TO US. HE WON'T HAVE A LAST WORD DIRECOR HEADING BUT NO OF. THE BUT I WILL. IF YOU TAKE THE LAST WORD. SENATOR I WOULD SET TELL YOU THAT- WASHINGTON STATE. HAS CREATED A PROGRAM IN THE SENATE PROGRAM FOR BUSINESSES AS WELL AS- A NEW YORK STATE. THERE A PRIVATE. PRIVATE SYSTEM DIFFERENT THAN OUR PUBLIC SYSTEM- FOR PAID LEAVE SO IT'S SO IT'S DIFFERENT THERE- AND I KNOW THAT- THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTEE HAS DEFINITELY TAKEN A LOOK AT A- TIME- UNEMPLOYMENT RATES- TO THIS AND LOOKING AT AND- POSSIBLE BENEFIT- TO EMPLOYERS USING THAT TYPE OF THE SYSTEM BUT- NOTHING CONCRETE PROSTATE AS OF YET BUT THERE ARE SOME. EXCITING PROGRAMS I THINK TO YOUR POINT TO TRY TO INCENTIVIZE. ARE GOOD EMPLOYERS A TO COME ALONG. THANK YOU AND I HOPE. JUST TO RESPOND THE THAT WE KNOW LAW THAT WE THAT WE HAVE SOME KIND OF A UNIFORM SYSTEM HERE SO THAT. PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO EMPLOYERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. SO THAT WILL I THINK THAT ALSO WILL HELP PEOPLE ACCESS THE PROGRAM WHEN THERE'S LESS CONFUSION. ANY OTHER THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS OR SHOULD WE SAY. THANK YOU TO THIS PANEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. YOUR INSIGHTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. A NUMBER OF YOU I QUESTIONS OF MR HENNING X. SOME POINT TODAY I'LL CALL YOU. OF YEAH YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOVE IT. CONSTANT DESIRE.

AND AFTER A DIVORCE AND ESTABLISHING MYSELF AND A WELL LOVED AND FILLING CAREER. HOW. I SPENT TWO YEARS HONING MY SKILLS. CLIMBING THE RANKS TO BECOME THE HEAD OF MY DEPARTMENT. MY LIFE WAS GOING WELL. I OWN MY OWN HOME I HAD A GOOD JOB A CAREER THAT WAS FILLING SOMETHING THAT I CAN POUR MY HEART INTO AND FEEL LIKE I WAS. GIVING TO MAKING UNIT COMMUNITY. MY WIFE IS GETTING BACK ON TRACK AFTER A TOUGH DIVORCE. I MET MY PARTNER. AN EXPECTEDLY BECAME PREGNANT. THIS CREATED A HARDSHIP AS I WAS THE MAIN MAJOR. STE. MY JOB WAS ONLY A SUPPORTIVE AS THEY WERE OBLIGATED TO BE. I HAD MANY COMPLICATIONS. TING PRETERM LABOR STARTING AT FIVE MONTHS. AND. BEFORE BEING PLACED ON IT MEDICAL LEAVE I HAD DISCUSSED MAY RETURN WITH MY EMPLOYER THEY WE WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT TEMPORARY PART TIME WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE AND UPON MY RETURN. GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EASE BACK INTO THE RIGOROUS JOB I LOVED. ALL WAS WELL OR SO IT SEEMED. MY DELIVERY WENT WELL. UNFORTUNATELY MY BABY HAD COMPLICATIONS. SHE HAD AN A. L. T. E A LIFE THREATENING EVENT SHE ALMOST DIED. SHE'S IN THE NECK YOU FOR THREE WEEKS. I TOO WAS SUFFERING AN INFECTION AND POST PARTUM DEPRESSION. PARTLY DUE TO THE STRESS MY EMPLOYER WAS NO PLACING ON ME THEY WANTED ME TO RETURN AT SIX WEEKS AND MY BODY WAS NO WHERE NEAR HE'LL- I JUST NEEDED TIME. THAT THEY WERE UNFORTUNATELY UNWILLING TO GIVE. MAY PLEASE FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAS REJECTED A TOTAL OF THREE TIMES. USE THE EXCUSE THAT THERE WERE SMALL BUSINESS. TECHNICALLY THEY WERE ONE PERSON SHY. THE LOSS AT THAT TIME. WITH THAT CAME RETALIATION AND HEARD Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT THAT. I WAS DEMOTED. IN THE OFFER PART TIME WAS RESCINDED. THEY DEMANDED I RETURN AT FULL TIME AT FULL CAPACITY OR BE FIRED. INCLUDED TWELVE HOUR DAYS SOMETIMES SIX DAYS A WEEK PERFORMING ARDUOUS LABOR THAT INCLUDED HEAVY LIFTING AND LONG HOURS ON MY FEET. I WAS LEFT WITH THE BROKEN BODY IN A HELPLESS BABY I CONTINUOUS OXYGEN MONITORS. SHE WOULD NEED SPECIALIZED CARE IN A MEDICAL SETTING. THE ONLY SUCH DAY CARE WAS LOGICALLY AND FINANCIALLY UNATTAINABLE. FILLING LOS HOPELESS I TURNED TO MY DOCTOR. HE AGREED THAT THE UNDUE STRESS THAT MY JOB IN CARING FOR A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD WAS AFFECTING MY MENTAL HEALTH. I WAS PLACED ON DISABILITY FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR MONTHS. IN THAT FOURTH MONTH I WAS FIRED. ENDING MY BELOVED CAREER. THAT CAN GIVE ME HOPE AND A PURPOSE AFTER MY DIVORCE MY NEW LIFE HAD DRAMATICALLY CHANGED WE ARE IN OUR FAMILY A FIVE ON ONE INCOME. WE STRUGGLED UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANT USING STATE AID LIKE FOOD-STAMPS. HAD MY JOB HAD JUST GIVEN ME THAT EXTRA SIX WEEKS OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE I COULD HAVE HEALED. RETURN TO MY JOB AND MAINTAIN MY FAMILY AND SAID. WOMEN ARE THE GIVERS OF LIFE. WE SHOULD BE GIVEN THAT RESPECT BELIEVE MOTHERS. NOT TREAT THEM AS DISPOSABLE WE NEED TIME TO HEAL OUR BODIES OUR MINDS AND NURTURE THE LIFE THAT WE SUSTAIN FROM BEGINNING. GIVE YOUR MOTHER THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TIME IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR VERY SOCIETY. I KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR IS FOND OF THE PHRASE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THAT SHOULD INCLUDE MOTHERS.

SOME TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF WHAT THIRTY MEN DISCUSSED TODAY BECAUSE I THINK. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S REALLY WILL LOW INCOME WORKERS NEED AND SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS WE SEE IS JOB PROTECTION. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE ANY JOB PROTECTION ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE FIRED LEGALLY FOR TAKING BENEFITS THEY PAY FOR. JOB PROTECTED LEAVE LAWS CURRENTLY HAVE STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS YOU HAD TO BE ON THE JOB ONE YEAR WORK ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO YOUR LEAVE. AND FOR NEW PARENTS YOUR EMPLOYER MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY EMPLOYEES AT YOUR WORK SITE WITHIN SEVENTY FIVE MILES OR- IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE TIME OFF YOUR OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION OR FOR TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THEY MUST BE FIFTY EMPLOYEES AT YOUR WORK SITE WITHIN SEVENTY FIVE MILES. THIS MEANS THAT A FULL QUARTER OF THE WORKFORCE IS EXCLUDED FROM JOB PROTECTED BONNIE LEAVE UNDER THE NEW PARENT LEAVE ACT. AND THAT 40% OF THE WORKFORCE IS INELIGIBLE FOR JOB PROTECTED LEAVE TO CARE FOR ILL FAMILY MEMBER UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT THE ACT. BASED ON EMPLOYER SIZE ALONE. LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS LIKELY TO QUALIFY FOR JOB PROTECTION AS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY. TO WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS MORE LIKELY TO WORK PART TIME JOBS USUALLY SEVERAL PART TIME JOBS. AND MORE LIKELY TO SWITCH JOBS FREQUENTLY AS A RESULT MANY LOW WAGE WORKERS CANNOT USE THE PROGRAM FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB. LOW WAGE WORKERS MAKE UP 40% OF ELIGIBLE PAID FAMILY LEAVE RECIPIENTS BUT ONLY 24% OF ACTUAL CLAIMANTS SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS THAT LOW WAGE EARNERS. ARE SUBSIDIZING OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM FOR HIGH WAGE EARNERS. AND I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE STORIES OF OUR HELP L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G COLORS LIKE&lt;/c&gt; SARAH HERE WHO ONE IS JORGE HE WAS A RECENT COLOR. AND IS THE FATHER OF THREE HE IS THE SOLE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILY WHO WORKED AS A BUSSER EARNING SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR A BAR IN SAN FRANCISCO. WITH FEWER THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES WHEN YASSER TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF TO CARE FOR HIS NEWBORN HIS BOSS REPLIED THAT HE COULD NOT HOLD HIS JOB FOR HIM. JORGE WOULD HAVE RETURNED AFTER THOSE TWO WEEKS BUT IS BABY HAD COMPLICATIONS AND HAD TO RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL. THE JORGE LOST HIS JOB HE SAID. MY EMPLOYERS TO FIRE ME MY FAMILY AND ME VERY VULNERABLE THIS IS AN EMOTIONALLY PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY DRAINING EXPERIENCE STERN ALREADY STRESSFUL TIME IN MY LIFE. I AM DEVASTATED THAT I LOST MY JOB AND EXTRACT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ONLY. FOR HIS EMPLOYER FEWER THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES. NOT COVERED BY THE NEW PARENT LEAVE AT. THEREFORE THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REINSTATE HIM AFTER HIS LEAVE AND THEY LEGALLY LOSSES JOB. IN ADDITION TO EMPLOYER SIDE EXPENSIVE TENURE REQUIREMENTS LIKE WISELY LOW INCOME WORKERS WITHOUT JOB PROTECTION ANOTHER CALLER TASHA LOST HER JOB AT A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY WHEN HER FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BRAIN TUMOR. SHOULD ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB THREE MONTHS WHEN HER DAUGHTER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. AND THAT SHE WAS NOT YET ELIGIBLE FOR JOB PROTECTION. AND SHE WAS IS THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE. MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP BY SIMILAR BRICK CARTY DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND THEREFORE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFITS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE ALSO NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE- FOR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE UNLESS THEY OPT INTO A VERY EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM. AND STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE EXEMPTS CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF CHURCHES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. WE ALSO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A VERY NARROW DEFINITION OF FAMILY THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY CALIFORNIA'S LEAVES LAWS IS INCONSISTENT AND TOO NARROW. THANKS A SENATOR JACKSON'S LEADERSHIP CALIFORNIA EXPAND THE LIST OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT EMPLOYEE CAN CARE FOR UNDER THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT THE SAME LIST OF FAMILY MEMBERS UNDER OUR JOB PROTECTION LAWS. OUR JOB REDUCTION LOS DEPICTS LOSES BROADER LESS THIS MEANS AN EMPLOYEE CAN BE LEGALLY FIRED FOR TAKING PAID FAMILY LEAVE. TO CARE FOR SEARS SALE GRANDPARENT GRANDCHILD SIBLING PARENT IN LAW OR EVEN ADULT CHILD. ACROSS THE STATE STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY STATES ARE INCREASINGLY ENACTED LAWS WITH A BROADER DEFINITION OF FAMILY FOR EXAMPLE OR IN CONNECTICUT AND NEW JERSEY DEFINE FAMILY TO INCLUDE SOMEONE RELATED BY BLOOD OR AFFINITY. WHO'S CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THE PLAY IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIP. CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR LEAD TO REFLECT THE VALUE OF DIVERSE FAMILIES PARTICULARLY IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. THE NEXT THREE BARRIER THAT WE FOR TODAY'S INCLUDE AN ADEQUATE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATES- THE WAITER PLACING RATE IS FAR TOO LOW WE'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU SIMPLY CANNOT SURVIVE AND SIXTY OR 70% OF YOUR WAGES. WHEN YOU'RE BARELY MAKE IT WORK AND A HUNDRED PERCENT. ALTHOUGH THE WEIGHT REPLACEMENT RATE WAS RAISED TO SIXTY OR 70% IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH WE'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. THOSE RECEIVING 70% IS STILL SAID FAR TOO WELL AS- KRISTIN POINTED OUT. THOSE WORKERS WORKING FULL TIME AT MINIMUM WAGE STILL DID NOT RECEIVE A 70% WE RECENTLY SPOKE TO A FATHER TO HIS YOUNGEST CHILD WAS BORN AT TWENTY SIX WEEKS JUST TATION GRAYSON WORKS TWO JOBS AND IS THE SOLE BRAND WINNER FOR HIS FAMILY HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AT 60% TODAY'S BABY IS J. CENTER TWO HOURS OFF FROM WORK TO SPEND TIME WITH HIS NEWBORN IN THE NECK YOU. AS A RESULT HE SAID IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BOND WITH HIM I WOULD HAVE HAD A STRONGER BOND MY KIDS IF I THOUGHT I HAD MORE TIME WITH THEM FROM THE START. IN A- REASON THE WAITER PLACE RATE CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO EXTEND THE DURATION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO ALIGN WITH THE PERIOD OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE. AS WE KNOW CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM OFFERS SIX WEEKS IT WILL SOON BE EIGHT WEEKS STARTING JULY FIRST. BUT JOB PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR TWELVE WEEKS. BECAUSE LOW WAGE WORKERS CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE UNPAID TIME OFF THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE. AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE EMPLOYER PROVIDED PAY. THEY HAVE TO FOR GO SEVERAL WEEKS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TAKE UP. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TAKE IT PAID AND IT'S JUST EXASPERATION IN EQUITY LEAVE TAKING BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH EARNERS. FINALLY ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS SUCH AS DIFFICULTY READING LIVE CLOSER SUPPORT AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IMPEDE ACCESS FOR COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS. WE RECEIVED MANY CALLS ON OUR HEALTH PLAN FROM WORKERS HAS SPENT HOURS OR EVEN DAYS ATTEMPTING TO CALL THE EDT TO ASK QUESTIONS OR ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR PLANS. ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE MAXIMUM CALL VOLUME HAS BEEN EXCEEDED TO TRY AGAIN ANOTHER DAY. MOREOVER HEN APPLICATION FORMS ARE NOT IN WORKERS ONLY WHICH IS OTHER THAN ENGLISH. A NEW LINE ACTED THIS YEAR WILL REQUIRE EDT TO PUBLISH ALL THE FORMS IN. LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY THE STANGEL NUMBER NON ENGLISH SPEAKING APPLE HANDS. BUT BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BUT GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION LANGUAGE ACCESS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ALL FORMS A CUSTOMER SUPPORT AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. IN ADDITION THE EDT SHOULD ENSURE THAT ALL THEIR FORMS ARE RENDON APPROPRIATE READING LEVELS FOR LOW LITERACY READERS. THE AGENCY SHOULD ALSO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS MANY OF WHOM WERE DENIED OR DETERRED FROM APPLYING DUE TO UNNECESSARY BURDEN SUCH AS THE CHOIR MEANT THAT AN ONLINE APPLICATIONS HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR STATE ID. THE EIGHTY SHOULD ALSO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR WORKERS OR MIS CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. BY PUBLICIZING FACILITATING THE PROCESS FOR WORKERS TO CHALLENGE THEM IS CLASSIFICATION RECEIVE BENEFITS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AS A SOME METRIC. GONZALEZ KNOWS FAR TOO WELL THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE IN THE NEXT YEAR. YOU HEARD ME TELL PATRICK WE GOT SOMETHING YEAH YEAH. VÃ  TO REALIZE THE PROMISE OF PEACE AND LEAVING CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST. NO ONE SHOULD BE FIRED FOR TAKING BENEFITS THEY PAY FOR. WAR TO TAKE TIME OFF TO CARE FOR NEW CHILD A REAL FAMILY MEMBER OF. A FAMILY SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL AND WE'D REPLACEMENT SHOULD BE HIGHER ESPECIALLY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS AND THE DURATION SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO MATCH THE PERIOD OF JOB PROTECTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO JUST A LITTLE BIT QUICKER AND HAVE NO TIME FOR KILLING ME. QUICK NOTE JUST CHECKING. I WILL DO MY BEST. THANK YOU CHAIR IS GONZALEZ AND JACKSON AND SLIMMER A MCCARTY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY I SWEAR I'M NOT TEXTING JUST TIMING MYSELF. SO YES THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS AT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE WERE. ONE OF THE FEW GROUPS THAT CO SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT CREATED THE PROGRAM AT THIS POINT. THE BENEFITS ARE SO CLEAR AND OBVIOUS THAT IT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE A WORLDWITHOUT THIS PROGRAM THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING OTHER THAN WHAT. YOU UNION WAS ABLE TO NEGOTIATE WHAT YOUR EMPLOYER WAS WILLING TO OFFER AND IT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND TOUGH TO ENFORCE AND WHERE WE ARE NOW IS IN A MUCH MUCH BETTER PLACE. IT'S KIND OF AN INSPIRING EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC POLICY REALLY CHANGING THE CULTURE. THAT PARENTS ESPECIALLY MALE PARENTS REALLY LOOK AT THEIR JOB. OF BEING A PARENT AS DIFFERENTLY NOW THAN THEY DID PRIOR TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROGRAM THAT. WITH THIS ALLOWANCE OF THEIR IN THE LAW. IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IT DOES SEND A MESSAGE TO THOSE WORKERS THAT. THIS IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS SOMETHING THE GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED IN THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE INVOLVED AND WE ALL NEED TO DO THIS WE ALL NEED TO. TAKE THIS TIME TO BOND WITH OUR CHILDREN. AND AS A RESULT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH WANT TO PROTECT. WE VERY MUCH DO WANT TO EXPAND AND WE AGREE THAT THE CURRENT BENEFIT DURATION WAGER PLACEMENT ARE OFTEN NOT ENOUGH AND THEY SHOULD BE EXPANDED- OVERALL WE HOPE THAT THIS RENEWED FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM. DOES THOSE START A LONG OVERDUE CONVERSATION ABOUT FINANCING THE PROGRAM. AND PARTICULARLY WHETHER OR NOT THE WAY THAT WE FINANCE THE PROGRAM GIVES US A- WIDE ENOUGH BASIS ON WHICH TO BUILD. THE IDEAL PROGRAMS THAT WERE ALL CONSIDERING HERE TODAY. AS WAS MENTIONED THE FAMILY PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY FUNDED ENTIRELY THROUGH THE D. I. FUND. THAT WAS BEGIN I THINK IN NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. AND WAS CREATED TO GIVE WORKERS. KIND OF STORE MONEY FOR WHEN THEY SUFFER A NON. FULL NON WORK RELATED INJURY FOR UP TO A YEAR. AND ARE WE CREATE THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. IT INCLUDED BOTH SIX WEEKS IT WAS JUST KIND OF PUT INTO THE D. I'VE FOUGHT. WITH SIX WEEKS PAID FOR BY THE WORKER AND SIX WEEKS PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYER- EARLY IN THE SESSION THE SIX WEEKS. WERE TO BE FUNDED BY THE EMPLOYER WERE TAKEN OUT. AND SO WHAT WE WERE LEFT WITH WAS ESSENTIALLY HALF OF THE PROGRAM THAT WAS ENVISIONED. AND THAT'S- WHERE THINGS STOOD FOR QUITE AWHILE. AS A RESULT THE MISSION BY THE FIRST PANEL. REALLY AREN'T SOMETHING OF AN OUTLIER WITH RESPECT TO OTHERS. EIGHT OF THE NINE THAT OFFICE PROGRAM. OTHER WEAPONS OUT WORKERS TO FUND THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S US RHODE ISLAND CONNECT FOR THE ONLY ONES. IS OUT OF THE OTHER STATES EITHER SPLIT THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN. EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES OR THEY ASK EMPLOYERS TO FUND THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE THE VAST MAJORITYASK EMPLOYERS THE FUN PART OF THE PROGRAM. THE MOST COMMON WAY IS ACTUALLY THROUGH THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OF THAT COUNTRY. AND SO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S USUALLY KIND OF LIKE IT IS HERE WHERE IT'S HOW FROM THE BY THE WORKER HOW FUNDED BY THE EMPLOYER. AND ARE ALSO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES- BOTH PARTIES. HAVE PUT FORTH PAID FAMILY PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED BY BOTH. SUPPORT PLANS THAT EITHER SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS OR PUT ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITY ON EMPLOYERS. AND ARE NONE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP PROPOSE ONE THAT IS FUNDED ALL BY EMPLOYERS- THERE WERE SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH THE ONES PROPOSED BY THAT PARTY BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT. IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE IS OF ONE THAT SHOULD AT A MINIMUM BE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS- AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS THERE FOR A REASON THAT AS WAS ALSO MENTIONED THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT VERY MUCH BENEFITS BOTH WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS THAT. THERE ARE CLEAR QUANTIFIABLE SAVINGS IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE COST OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED BENEFITS THAT. PRIOR TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE EMPLOYERS IF THEY DID OFFER THE PAY FOR THE WHOLE THING. AND WE CREATED THE PROGRAM THEY ONLY HAD TO PAY AND- AS WE EXPANDED. ACOSTA LAWYER DOWN THE COST TO THE WORKER GOES UP AS LONG AS WE KEEP THE EXIST FINANCING STRUCTURE. THEY'RE ALSO SAVINGS INVOLVED IN NOT HAVING TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN NEW WORKERS. BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS WORKERS TO GO BACK TO THE JOB HEY DON'T HAVE TO QUIT AND GO FIND A NEW ONE. AND THEY'RE ALSO PRODUCTIVITY. S. ON MOTHER REALLY TWO PIECES TO THAT ONE WAS WHAT WILL LIKELY AT SOME POINT B. A TAX INCREASE FOR WORKERS. AND THEN ALSO A REDUCTION IN THE SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS- WE THINK WERE ARGUABLY UNFAIR FOR A FEW REASONS. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE STI FUND AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH ATTENTION AND THAT'S THAT. WHEN A WORKER SUFFERS AN ON THE JOB INJURY THE EMPLOYER FIGHTS THE CLAIM THEY SAY WE DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENED HERE AT WORK. THE WORKER USUALLY HAS TO GO OUT ON DISABILITY INSURANCE THEY TELL ET DE THAT THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE APPEALS BOARD FINDS THAT IT WAS A COMPENSABLE INJURY. EDS SUPPOSED TO GO BACK TO THE EMPLOYER GET THEIR MONEY BACK. WE'RE TOLD THAT PRETTY RARELY HAPPENS AND THAT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN IT'S SETTLED FOR MUCH LOWER AMOUNT SO. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY THAT SHE IN THE I FROM THAT'S NOT THERE. THE BEST ESTIMATE THAT WE'VE GOT IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT SHOULD BE ON THE FIVE THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE- THERE ARE ALSO A CERTAIN THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL INSOLVENCY THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM IS CONNECTED TO THIS. THAT TIME THE WIFE WHEN INSOLVENT LAST RECESSION. THEY BORROWED THROUGH THE TEN DOLLARS IT WAS CLOSE TO DOLLARS. OUT OF THE D. I. FUNDED COVER THE INTEREST ON THOSE. WAS VERY PREDICTABLE WIND THAT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN EVERY AND THAT THERE'S A RECESSION WE DON'T. ADEQUATELY FUND THE U. I. SYSTEM. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD PLAN FOR WHAT TO DO TO COVER THAT INTEREST AND SO THE ONLY OPTION WE ARE LEFT WITH LAST TIME WAS TO. BASICALLY ASK WORKERS TO BAIL OUT EMPLOYERS BECAUSE WE JUST COLLECTIVELY. SEEM TO NOT BE WILLING TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE U. I. SYSTEM. AND SO THAT'S-AN ISSUE THERE'S ALSO THE CONCERN THAT. AS THE FIRST PANEL MENTIONED THAT WORKER WHICH IS REALLY HAVEN'T GOT. MUCH IF AT ALL IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND- IF WE DO THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM IS WORTH EXPANDING. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE WORKERS ARE REALLY IN A PLACE TO ABSORB. HIGHER TAXES HIGHER IMPACTS ON. THE PHONE WHAT WE LIKE TO DO AND ALSO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE ADEQUACY RATE. SO WE PAID FOR WILL WE TRY TO PAY FOR MOST OF WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR BY REDUCING THAT ADEQUACY RATE FROM ONE POINT FOUR FIVE TO ONE POINT SPREE. MEETING THAT WE SET THE WORKER TAX RATE AT. WHAT DO WE PAY OUT WE MULTIPLY THAT BY THAT ACT WAS HERE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE SET THE RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT CAME IN. AND AT ONE POINT FOUR FIVE EQUITY FACTOR. WAS JUST PULL THE SCOTT WE CAN HAVE A PRETTY PAINFUL PROCESS OF TRIAL AND ERROR IN THE PAST WHERE. THERE WERE THREE YEARS THE FUND WENT SOFT AND SO TO AVOID THAT WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS. BASICALLY RIGHT TO WEAR IT NOW NOT WHERE IT'S BEEN IT'S- BEEN. HE HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM. BUT WE'RE PRETTY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ONE POINT 3% ADEQUACY RATE- MY ARM. THERE ARE TWENTY SIX YEARS SINCE NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN. THAT THE ADVISORY HAS DIPPED BELOW THAT. SO WERE THAT TO HAPPEN NOW. THERE REALLY KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WE WOULD PROBABLY REDUCE BENEFITS WHICH IS WHAT WE DID LAST TIME. AND THAT'S MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE TIME IT'S GONE BELOW THAT AND SO. HOPEFULLY HISTORY WILL BE A GUIDE HERE BUT WE WON'T REALLY KNOW WAS HAVE TO SEE HOW IT HAPPENS- AND IN THE LAST WEEK WE WANTED TO. IT WAS JUST THAT. AS FAR AS EXPANDING PAID FAMILY BENEFITS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT BOTH IN TERMS OF DURATION WAGER PLACEMENT BUT- THE FACT OF. ITS OWN. IN A WOVEN INTO THE ES DE I SYSTEM IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND THAT WERE WE TO SAY. RAISE THE WAITER PLACEMENT RATE FOR PAID FAMILY WITHOUT DOING THE SAME DISABILITY INSURANCE. LIKE IT OR NOT WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE TO WORKERS THAT THE STATE. PRIORITIZE AS ONE OVER THE OTHER AND SO. NOT ALL OF OUR AFFILIATES NOT ALL OF OUR MEMBERS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THAT. THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW TAKING TIME OFF TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERN IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AS BABY BONDING OR- TAKING TIME OFF TO CARE FOR A SICK RELATIVE A SICK PARENT SICK CHILD. IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS BABY BONDING BUT THAT. IF WE DO. I'M OUT AND SAY THAT ONE SHOULD BE REIMBURSED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE OTHER. IT'S LIKELY GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF FILL A LOT OF CONCERN AMONG OUR MEMBERS THAT. MAY NOT BE THE INTENT BUT WOULD LIKELY BE THE OUTCOME AND SO. THOSE ARE JUST SOME ISSUES AND- WE DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. DOCTOR WRITTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JUST GONNA HOPEFULLY SLIDE UP HERE. THE MEDIA. GREAT OKAY SO THANK YOU IM AND THANK YOU BOTH FOR OF NOT ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT IN A VISIBLE POPULATION WITH IN OUR WORK POPULATION- WHICH ARE FAMILY CARE GIVERS. OVER THE YEARS WE CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS. CURRENTLY A MAJORITY OF THEM WORK OVER 50% AND MOST IDENTIFIES FEMALE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN POTENTIAL CARE GIVERS FOR EVERY PERSON OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTY AND CURRENTLY CARE GIVERS PROVIDE MORE INTENSIVE AND COMPLEX CARE THEN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN HISTORY AS MEDICAL NURSING TASKS AND MULTIPLE HEALTH CONDITIONS HAVE INCREASED. OVER TIME. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY BUT WHAT IS NOW DOESN'T REFLECT THE FUTURE. A MERE TEN YEARS THE CARE GIVER SUPPORT RATIO IS EXPECTED TO PLUMMET AS BOOMERS TRANSITION FROM YOUNG CARE GIVERS INTO PEOPLE WHO NEED CARE. BY TWENTY THIRTY THE SUPPORT RATIO WILL BE ABOUT FOUR CARE GIVERS TO EVERY PERSON OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND BY TWENTY FIFTY IT IS GOING TO BE BELOW THREE TO ONE. RIGHT NOW THE CHALLENGES OF CARE GIVERS FACE WILL REALLY BE RISING AS THE POPULATION OF PERSONS WITH DEMENTIA CHRONIC PAIN MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS CONTINUE TO SWELL IN OUR STATE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A SURVEY FUNDED BY A. R. P. OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS THEY FOUND IT A FULL 41% OF THOSE SURVEYED ARE OR HAVE BEEN UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS. CURRENTLY 74% OF THOSE CARE GIVERS REPORT FEELING STRESSED BY WORKING AND PROVIDING CARE AT THE SAME TIME. ANOTHER 71% REPORTED HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR WORK SCHEDULE TO ACCOMMODATE CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT AGAIN WHAT CURRENT DOESN'T REFLECT THE FUTURE. IN TWENTY YEARS IT IS PROJECTED THAT 51% OF WORKERS WILL BE- EXPERIENCE HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE WITH FAMILY CARE GIVING SO WE'RE GOING FROM A 44% OF WORKERS WILL STILL BE IN THE WORK FORCE. AS OLDER CARE GIVERS. LOOKING AT DEMOGRAPHICS CURRENTLY THE MAJORITY OF CARE GIVERS ARE WHITE BUT BY TWENTY FIFTY THIS PROFILE WILL CHANGE AND THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC CARE GIVERS WILL BE CLOSER TO THE MAJORITY. AND ALSO A MAJORITY OF THOSE CARE GIVERS WILL BE OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTY YEARS OLD THEMSELVES. THIS MONTH. I ACTUALLY DID IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITTLE HEART THERE I DID A QUICK REVIEW OF NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN THE PAST YEAR WHICH FEATURED CARE GIVING. THE DOODLE REPRESENTS KEY WORDS THAT WERE USED IN THE ARTICLE HEADLIGHTS THE MORE OFTEN THE WORD IS USED THE LARGER THE FOUGHT. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE ARTICLES CURRENTLY THERE'S A RISING TIDE OF AWARENESS AMONG OUR BLOOMERS AND ARE MILLENNIALS. AND ARE THEY ARE REALLY BMP IMPACTED BY CARE GIVING BUT THEY'R ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WORK AND STRESS AT THE SAME TIME. ANOTHER REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES ALSO SUGGEST THE CARE GIVERS REPORT POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH THE NON CARE GIVERS. THEY ALSO RECEIVE THE CARE RECEIVER HOWEVER WHO DOES HAVE A CARE GIVER SHOW BETTER HEALTH pOUTCOMES AND LOWER RATES OF HOSPITAL USAGE AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE INSTITUTIONAL CARE. SO WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIA'S CARING FAMILIES WELL RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CAUGHT IN A RIP TIDE AND REALLY YELLING FOR HELP AND THE ONLY LIFE GUARD IS NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE FAMILY CARE GIVER. THE CLAIMS PROCESS FOR THE PFL INTERMITTENT LEAVE IS SO TREACHEROUS THAT MOST CARE GIVERS WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO FILL OUT THE FORMS. THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY ONLY 10% OF PFL CLAIMS ARE FOR CARE GIVERS BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY SPEND DEMOGRAPHICS THAT'S FAR TOO LOW. CARE GIVERS AND NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF TO HELP A SICK PARROT OR GRAVELY ILL LEFT ONE ARE JUST GIVING UP THEIR CUTTING BACK ON HOURS AND THEY'RE LEAVING THE WORK FORCE ARE WORKING MORE AND FEELING MORE STRESS MOREOVER WOMEN AND ETHNIC AND RACIAL POPULATIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO THIS PATTERN. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE JEOPARDIZING THEIR HEALTH AND FINANCIAL FUTURES SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE OVER FIFTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA. IN UNPAID LONG TERM CARE BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE SAFETY NET TO CATCH THEM BEFORE THEY DROUGHT. AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE CARE GIVERS. LET'S BE REAL I MEAN ISN'T CARE GIVING A PRIVATE FAMILY ISSUE. IS WHAT WE DO FOR LOVE. YOU KNOW LET THE FAMILIES BE THE LIFE PRESERVERS I MEAN HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. WELL THE FAMILY STRUCTURE REALLY HAS CHANGED AND SO HAS THE NATURE OF CARE GIVING. THERE NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE FEWER PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE GROWING OLDER POPULATION. MORE PEOPLE ARE REQUIRING CHRONIC CARE AND CARE NEEDS THAT REQUIRE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE PAST WE'RE REALLY DONE BY NURSES. AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THEY'RE BEING DONE IN THE HOME UNSUPERVISED. MORE OF THE TRADITIONAL CARE GIVERS WHO WERE WOMEN ARE ALSO WORKING. THEIR SINGLE HAVE ADULT CHILDREN AND THEY REALLY CAUGHT IN WHAT WEEK OFTEN HERE AS THE SANDWICH GENERATION. AND THEY'RE ALSO NEED THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. OVERALL THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND FAMILY STRUCTURE CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT IF WE DON'T SUPPORT CARE GIVERS TO HELP MAINTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS IN THEIR HOME. OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WILL BE RAPIDLY OVERWHELMED WITH THE RISING COST OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE. SO WHAT DO I RECOMMEND WE CAN START RESCUING THESE CARE GIVERS AND OUR STATE'S ECONOMY TODAY IF WE LOOK AT THE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN A RECENT SURVEY. BY BOTH HUMAN IMPACT PARTNERS AND A. R. P. WE NEED TO PROVIDE JOB PROTECTION SO THAT THESE CARE GIVERS WHO TEND TO BE OLDER ARE NOT FORCED OUT OF THE WORKPLACE WITH LITTLE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING RE HIRED BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE WE NEED TO PROVIDE TAX CREDITS SO THAT OUT OF POCKET SPENDING IS REDUCED. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WAYS TO OFFSET LOST RETIREMENT INCOME SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP HOMELESS ARE IN POVERTY. WE NEED TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS TO IDENTIFY WORKING CARE GIVERS SO WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT EARLY. AND NOT WHEN THEY BECOME TOO DEPRESSED OR SICK TO CONTINUE WORKING. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO NEED BOTH PARENTAL AND FAMILY pTHEIR LIFETIME. ARE NOT PENALIZED BY PAID FAMILY LEAVE POLICIES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. AND FINALLY WE NEED TO ASSIST PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE WORKING IN LOW WAGE JOBS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY PFL POLICIES THEY DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE WAGE REPLACEMENT- LACK OF JOB PROTECTIONS. IF WE BEGIN NOW. WE CAN REALLY TURN THE TIDE SO THAT IN TWENTY YEARS CALIFORNIA WILL NOT DROWN IN RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS. RISING NO JUST NURSING HOME UTILIZATION AND IN A FLOOD OF STRESSED OUT AND FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO TREAD WATER. THANK YOU. SO I AM CONNECT TALK BRIEFLY JUST ABOUT THE- KIND OF THE POSITIVE EXCITING TIME WERE AND EVEN THOUGH I REALLY LIVE IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE JUST HEARD. IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT THAT I'M CALIFORNIA WORK AND FAMILY COALITION IS FOCUSED ON- FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS ESPECIALLY REALLY TRYING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PAID LEAVE- BUT STILL I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND IN A LOT OF WAYS. I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH HOPE AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT I WHERE I THINK WE CAN GO NEXT. NOT JUST IN THE STATE WITH A ADMINISTRATION AND WITH A LOT OF OUR LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE BEEN GREAT CHAMPIONS ON THIS WORK AT THE LEGISLATORS HERE AND THIS- PANEL BUT- ALSO JUST THE GROWING MOMENTUM AND MOVEMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY- REALLY FOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE AMPLE OF THE REASONS I EMPHASIZE THAT MOVEMENT BUILDING. IS FEEL LIKE THAT'S ULTIMATELY THE WAY WERE VÃ»I SOME OF THEM GET IF THINGS LIKE WITH ME THE ARMY BONTA TRUMP PEOPLE LIKE. SUCH AS- THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY MOVE RIGHT- POLICY THAT MEANING FOR THE- PEOPLE IS I BUILDING THEM MAN OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVE AND HAVE THEIR VOICES AT THE TABLE. THAT'S REALLY THE ROLE OF THE COLD SENATE. WORK THAT THESE GROUPS HERE THE ENGAGED. IN DOING IS FOR THESE. PEOPLE TO FALL. YOU KNOW I. THAT. IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT NOW IN TWO THOUSAND TWO WE HELPED PASSED THE FIRST LEAVE LAW IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT IT WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS. IT HAPPENED IN ONE YEAR THAT TEN YEARS HAS BEEN MORE AND KIND OF TRYING TO IMPROVE IT. MAKE IT REALLY WORK FOR MORE PEOPLE BUT WHEN IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY ONE OF THE POSITIVES IS THAT IT REALLY. SPARKED THE IMAGINATION OF PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I MEAN I GOT HEADLINES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. EVEN ON WEST WING A YEAR BEFORE THEY WERE SAYING AHA AND THEN WE'LL HAVE PAID LEAVE LIKE THAT. WOULD NEVER HAPPEN YOU KNOW IN THE UNITED STATES AND AS WE KNOWN AS IS CENTER JACKSON MENTIONED WERE QUITE ALONE. IN THE UNITED STATES AND BEING ONE OF THE FEW COUNTRIES- MORE THAN FIFTY COUNTRIES HAVE SIX MONTHS OF PAID LEAVE. FOR AT LEAST ONE PARENT SO WE'RE WE'RE WAY BEHIND THERE BUT SINCE WE SPARKS THIS A LOT OF STATES IN EIGHT STATES HAVE LEAVE LAWS. WE ARE PART OF A NETWORK OF TWENTY SEVEN STATE COALITIONS. EVEN IN STATES YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR PAID SICK DAYS AND PAID LEAVE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GIVE US THE RIGHT TO CARE FOR OURSELVES AND CARE. HEATHER AND HAVE ECONOMIC SECURITY WHILE DOING SO WHICH- REALLY SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL AND PART OF WHY I THINK WE NEED TO PUSH TOWARD THAT UNIVERSAL. GOAL IS THAT THAT GETS RID OF THE OTHER PROBLEM OF PEOPLE NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. A LOT OF COUNTRIES PEOPLE AREN'T SITTING HERE WONDERING IF THEY QUALIFY FOR THIS OR THAT OR IF THEY CAN TAKE TIME OFF ON THAT BABY. ARE THEIR PARENT NEEDS THEM THEY JUST DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT IS YOUR PERSONAL. THEY SHOULD BE AND THAT'S- REALLY WHERE I THINK. WE NEED TO BE HAD IT BUT I THINK WE'RE IN. A BETTER POSITION THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN THIS STATE BECAUSE THE MINUTE WE PASSED PAID LEAVE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS WAS OUT AS YOU ALL REMEMBER. AND SOMEBODY WHO DON'T LIKE THE PROGRAM SOME BUT IT'S WAS IN. AND IT WAS A FIGHT EVEN TO NOT HAVE DECIMATED PROGRAM DIFFERENT WAYS. SO THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN PROTECTING INTERACTIVE. AND THAT. I'M STILL ONE OF THE THINGS. I THINK. IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT KIND OF THE MOVEMENT. THIS HOW MEANINGFUL THE PROBE. IS OR JUST THE RIGHT TO CARRY IS THE PEOPLE- IF YOU'VE BEEN TO A COALITION. YOU KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS KIND OF GROUND OURSELVES IN. WHY THIS MATTERS TO US INTO OUR ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT AND WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE. FIGHTING FOR A LOW WAGE WORKERS WHETHER IT'S- NEW IMMIGRANT ORGANIZER'S. OF PEOPLE ALL TALK ABOUT WHY THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY WORKS FOR. YOU KNOW THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW I TOOK IT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD- HOW AND UP WITH I HAVE THREE KIDS TO AND THAT'S THAT'S HARD. THAT IS TO HAVE ONE'S I USED TO THINK- WHEN WE PASSED A LEVY A BUT I'LL TAKE IT FROM MY PARENTS AND DAY. AND I HAD TWINS THAT IT WAS A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY. AND I WAS OUT ON PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE AND I NEEDED PAID LEAVE- BEEN IT JUST WAS SO MEANINGFUL FOR ME. TO BE ABLETO HAVE THAT TIME- BUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I WAS THAT- IN MY SPARE TIME I WORK ON. HOUSING RIGHTS AND RENTERS RIGHTS AND I WAS AT A BIGGEST. BILLY AND IT INGLEWOOD. TONS OF RENTERS ALL OVER THE STATE WHERE THERE AND IT WAS A LONG LINE FOR LANCE. I'M OVERLY FRIENDLY AND REALLY NOSY. THE WOMAN BEHIND ME I SO TALKING TO HER. AND SHE HAS WORKED AT A JOB FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. TOOK TIME OFF BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER HAD. A SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY FIRED HER. AND IT'S THE GUY KNOWS ENOUGH TO KNOW IT DEFINITELY A LARGE ENOUGH EMPLOYER. GIVING YOU HER. CONTACT INFO. SHE SAID I COULD. SO THIS IS JUST IT'S NOT WORKING FOR EVERYBODY EQUALLY WHEN I TAKE IT. I NOT ONLY. MY BOSS WAS THE WOMAN WHO TRAPPED TOM RANKIN IN THE CAR AND MADE HIM. BECOME THE COAST. THIS IS A VERY BEHIND THAT'S THE PHARMACY WAS VERY BEHIND PAID LEAVE. SO I HAD A UNION CONTRACTS SO EVEN IF MY BOSS CHANGED HER MIND. I HAD A LOT OF THINGS GOING FOR ME WHEN I TOOK IT FOR THE TWINS. WE NEED EVERYBODY TO HAVE THAT SAME YOU KNOW THING AND THAT'S WHY WE- EVEN THOUGH WE PASSED THE LEAVE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE EXPANDED THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK. SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE COMING TOGETHER IN DECEMBER. TO PLAN OUR WORK FOR THE NEXT YEAR. AND IT REALLY JUST COUNTY TOP DOWN BUT WE WANT TO REALLY PUSH. THINGS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT THEY NEED TO GO. OVER A- I AM SAYING IS THAT. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK TO WHAT'S- IN THE DIFFERENT STATES AND YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. WE NEED TO LOOK AT. LIKE NEW YORK WHICH IN THEIR VERY FIRST SEE HER. HAVE HER FATHER'S TAKE A MORE CARE GIVERS TICKET. I'M A MAJORITY PEOPLE MAKING FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TAKING IT. I THAT REIGNS AT VERY DIFFERENT THAN CALIFORNIA I THINK JOHN UNIVERSAL JOBMATCH. IS A VERY BIG REASON FOR THAT BECAUSE- AS MOST OF YOU KNOW NEW YORK HAS EVEN LESS. PROFESSOR RIGHT NOW. THOUGH THEY'LL BE RAMPS. TO INTO. WHETHER IT'S THE SEVEN. YOU. KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO BE. A LOT MORE. ULTIMATELY I THINK AS WE HAVE THIS MOMENTUM FROM. THE ADMINISTRATION OUR LEGISLATIVE. WE IN THE COALITION ARE GOING INTO A YEAR WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO BE IN THE FIELD. BUILDING UP THAT'S OF. RECENTLY HAD AN IN PERSON MEETING. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WITH PATRICK AND ALL HIS STAFF. IN LA WE HAD PEOPLE THAT A FATHER FROM SAN DIEGO JERRY SOUND OF ALL THE CAME. AND SPOKE ABOUT WHERE TO PLACE AND- WE'RE REALLY DOING THAT WORK OF BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE. WHO CAN HELP CRAFT WHAT WE HAVE IN THE NEXT DAY. VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY HEAR THOSE VOICES. JUST YESTERDAY MY DAUGHTER HAD THIS DENTAL SURGERY ONE OF THE TWINS AND IT WAS REALLY INTENSE BECAUSE ACTUALLY HAD TO HAVE SOME- SEDATION SO IT WAS A MUCH BIGGER DEAL AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT PAINFUL AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE BECAUSE- THIS IS A REALLY GREAT DAY I HAVE BOTH MY MOM. WITH ME THIS MORNING. FLICK. BECAUSE I'M DIVORCED BUT I'M FOR BETTER FOR WORSE MY EXCELLENCE EIGHT. FOR ME LATELY SEE THE MOTHER. BUT JUST THE IDEA THAT WE ARE BOTH OF THEIR IN THE SAME PLACE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO BE WITH HER AT THAT TIME THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER AND I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD. ANYWAY I JUST FOR MY PART IS TO SET. BRINGING PEOPLE TABLE DOING ALL THE WORK THAT EVERYBODY HERE IS DOING IS GOING TO BE KEY. THANK YOU FOR SERRANO I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE ON THIS- WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT ONE AT LEAST I. DEFINITELY DO SO- INCORPORATED IN OUR QUESTIONS WE WANT TO OPEN UP MAKE SURE IF THERE IS- QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. WHAT A WOULD BE BEFORE YOU LEAVE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC SO THAT WE- IF WE- HAVE. PROBABLY ALL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE GROUP UP FRONT BUT- IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME ON DOWN. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO.

FIVE CALIFORNIA AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY FREQUENT NERD. CHILD INTERACTIONS ARE KEY TO STRONG BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF LIFE THE RESEARCH MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE FIRST MONTHS AND YEARS ARE CRUCIAL TO LIVE SUCCESS WITH OVER 80% OF A CHILD'S BRAIN DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS- SO WORKING PARENTS MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEND THESE FIRST K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; MONTHS OF EACH&lt;/c&gt;</u> CHILD'S LIFE ESTABLISHING THAT FOUNDATION FOR LIFE SUCCESS. HOWEVER AS WE HEARD TODAY THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THIS BY TO LEAVE THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR PARENTS TO BUILD THIS FOUNDATION SO WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR JACKSON ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALES FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THESE DEVASTATING VERY VERY YEARS. HELLO IMPORTANCE OF PAID LEAVE AS WELL AS THE NEW SOME FOR AS COMMITMENT ENSURING ALL CALIFORNIA BABIES ARE THE BEST START IN LIFE BEGINNING WITH THIS CRUCIAL PARENT CHILD NING TIME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO IMPROVE HIS FAMILY ALL OF OUR FAMILIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OF ANY KIND. ALL RIGHT WELL WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO- LET ME. JUST IF I COULD ASK WATER TO QUESTION. TWO AGAIN IF YOU WOULD. ARE TURNING GOLD STANDARD WHAT SHOULD WE BE STRIVING TO IT. I THINK I MEAN REALISTICALLY REALISTICALLY THAT TAKES ABOUT CANNOT. REALISTICALLY IN CULVER I WHAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN WE'RE GOING INTO THE STATE I MEAN THIS YEAR WE HAD A PLANNING MEETING ON MONDAY WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT PEOPLE FROM LA TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS SEE WHERE. ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT COALITION PARTNERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE YOU KIND OF LAND ON THAT BUT WE DO HAVE A PLATFORM THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING THAT IS REALLY LOOKS AT AT LEAST EXTENDING YOU KNOW PAID LEAVE MORE SIX SETTING IT TO TWELVE WEEKS BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S ON THE HORIZON THEN REALLY THAT THAT BEING THE ULTIMATE TIME I'M A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE TALKED ABOUT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYING A YEAR- WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW PARENTS TAKING TURNS ARE DIFFERENT WHAT TO DO AT FOR BONDING YOU KNOW BUT JUST HAVING MORE TIME BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE REALLY FOCUS INTERPRETIVE SEQUENCING IS THE- SHOP. ACTION WHICH WE THINK. WITH YOUR PLACEMENT THAT IT. KIND OF. STARTING TO TALK WITH A CALIBER FED ON HOW DOES THAT LOOK IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T EITHER JEOPARDIZE THE FIND. AND OVER TAX LOW WAGE WORKERS TO HELP WHAT IT WHAT CAN WE COME TO YOU. AROUND THAT SO THESE ARE KINDS OF THE- YOU KNOW A BIG THINGS AND THEN REALLY. SOME OF THE MORE INVISIBLE THINGS ARE HAVING WORKERS AT THE TABLE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. JENNA POINTED OUT THAT ARE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE APPLY WE KNOW THAT CARE GIVER APPLICATIONS ARE PROCESSED DIFFERENTLY- WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT SO EASY FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO HOLD A VOTE TO. OPT IN TO PAY LEAVE WE KNOW THAT. A CONTRACTOR DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO GET INTO THE DA YOU EE PROGRAMMER. I NEEDED TO DO IT SIX MONTHS AGO. THAT MAKE ANY SENSE. THERE'S A LOT OF THAT JUST HAS TO BE. EVENED OUT IN THOSE AREN'T REALLY EXCITING ACT. THINGS TO WORK ON. A LOT OF PEOPLE. REALLY THREW DOWN IN LA YOU TALKING TO THE EASY D. ABOUT. THE SPANISH NOT BEING TOLD TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IS THAT THEY- HAVE BECAME A THAT'S A BIG THING AND WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT WE NEED. TO WORK WITH THE EDT ON PUSHING THIS FORWARD AND WORK WITH OUR- LEGISLATORS THAT'S PARTLY BY WE'RE GOING INTO THE FIELD. BUT I DO THINK THAT I'M REALLY UNIVERSAL JOB PROTECTION. IS THAT THE KEY AND WAGE REPLACEMENT- UP TO. REALLY A WORKERS HOWEVER WE- ACHIEVE THAT IN A- THAT MEANS THE FIND HAS LONGEVITY. ARE KIND OF THE TOP LINE ISSUES THANK YOU ANY OTHER. OKAY WELL. I JOIN THE CLOSING OF ENDED UP PRESS SURE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS- AND LOOK FOR DAY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAMBER AND HOW WE CAN THAT WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE THIS FORWARD- I ACTUALLY THINK REALISTIC ISN'T. BUT SHOULD. CONTROL OUR IDEAS IT'S- WHAT WOULD BENEFIT THE STATE THE MOST AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE WORKER OR THE PARENT IT'S THE CHILD- IT'S THE COMPANIES AND OUR WAY OF LIFE SO- I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WHERE WE'RE AT. IN A SHOCKING FOR ME TO SAY WERE SO CONTROLLED BY WHAT IS REALISTIC THAT WE DON'T DO THE TYPE OF HARD BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGES WE NEED IN ORDER TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. AND SO I HOPE WE'LL DO THAT I HOPE I WANT TO THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FOR COMING IN AND SHARING HER STORY THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT IN ANY FIELD OF WORK I'M AND WHEN IN TRYING TO GET CHANGE THAT MEANS SOMEBODY WITH THEIR FIRST. STORY BE ABLE TO COMMON EXPRESS THAT ALCUIN WEIGHING YOU DID IT A AND I THANK YOU IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT- WE- IN SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FIRST INTERNALIZE AS AS TO WORKING ON THESE ISSUES WE WORK SO HARD TO CHANGE THE LAWS. IN WHEN THE LIGHTS STILL. WORK FOR THE PEOPLE. THAT DEFICIT. AT THAT IT'S A LOT OF STATION FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BUT IT'S DEVASTATING TO US AND WE- SAT. SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING WITH US TODAY. SO JUST SO THAT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WE WERE ON A DIFFERENT PAGE WHAT BENEFITS THE STATE MOST IS WHAT'S MOST REALISTIC. THERE YOU GO. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU SEE THE GLASS IS HALF FULL. GOT AND WE WANT TO FILL THE GLASS AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND- I THINK THAT HAVING PEOPLE HERE TODAY AND SURE I AGREE YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THE PERSONAL STORY WE DE HUMANIZE THINGS WHEN WE TALK IN THE ABSTRACT FROM THIS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FAMILIES IT'S ALL ABOUT OUR FUTURE. TALK ABOUT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE A AND IT'S HARD TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON THAT A WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE CHAMBER WAS HERE. IS TO BRING ALL THE IFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE- THIS IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. AND A LOOK FORWARD TO AS YOU MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S VERY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS WHETHER IT'S ARE HAVING YOUNG CHILDREN AND HAVING BEEN A CARE GIVER TO HIS DAD WHO. RECENTLY PASSED AWAY I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY IN WHICH WE LIVE AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THAT SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK- MY CO CHAIR OR I GUESS. CHAIR FROM THE ONLY COMPANY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR COMING- STAFF WHO DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS FROM OF BOTH HOUSES I HOPE WILL HAVE A MORE I HOPE WHAT WILL BE THE WORK AT CLOSE TO GOV WHEN HIT THE- COMMITTEES.
