00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:04.168 region:rollup2
UP BILL IN ONE THAT I THINK

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:07.471 region:rollup2

CORRUPTION AND COERCION TO TAKE

00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:23.087 region:rollup2
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. WAS VERY

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:24.722 region:rollup2
CLEAR IN IDENTIFYING THAT THERE

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:25.923 region:rollup2
WERE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.225 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL BILL ALLOWING BALLOT

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:29.260 region:rollup2
HARVESTING.

00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:30.995 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A FIX

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.697 region:rollup2
THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND IT WOULD

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:34.799 region:rollup2
BE A SHAM TO BE TELLING THE

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:36.734 region:rollup2
VOTERS. THAT THIS WAS A FIX TO

00:45:34.799 --> 00:45:39.537 region:rollup2
THE CLEARLY IDENTICAL PROP

00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:40.004 region:rollup2

CORRUPTION AS WELL AS

00:45:40.004 --> 00:45:44.242 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
IF LEFT UNCHECKED

00:45:44.242 --> 00:45:49.113 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE NO PAPER TRAIL NO

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:51.115 region:rollup2
WAY TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY.

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:53.217 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERFERING WITH

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:55.686 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT PROCESS IN NEGATIVE

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:58.089 region:rollup2
IN NEFARIOUS WAYS.

00:45:55.686 --> 00:46:00.324 region:rollup2

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:06.664 region:rollup2
BOSSES.

00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:08.1000 region:rollup2

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.008 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT OUR

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:18.743 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HAS THE INTEGRITY TO BE

00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:21.278 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SURVIVE INTO THE NEXT

00:46:18.743 --> 00:46:23.848 region:rollup2
DECADES INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:28.419 region:rollup2

SO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
BILL I DID NOT VOTE FOR BECAUSE

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.434 region:rollup2
I AGREE THAT IT COULD LEAD TO

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:44.502 region:rollup2
BALLOT HARVESTING. AND CERTAINLY

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:45.770 region:rollup2
POSE SOME PROBLEMS WITH OUR

00:46:44.502 --> 00:46:48.039 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.974 region:rollup2

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:55.079 region:rollup2
I WILL AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:57.615 region:rollup2
SPEAKER THAT I DON'T THINK IT

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:59.383 region:rollup2
GOES FAR ENOUGH A RECEIPT WOULD

00:46:57.615 --> 00:47:00.584 region:rollup2
BE GREAT SOME SORT OF PROOF ONE

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:02.019 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THIS WAS COLLECTED IN

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.654 region:rollup2
BY HIM WOULD BE GREAT. THAT'S

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:05.790 region:rollup2

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:07.658 region:rollup2

I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU.

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:21.605 region:rollup2
