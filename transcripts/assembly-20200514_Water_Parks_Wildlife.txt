GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIR AND MEMBERS- MY NAME'S PUBLIC GARCIA WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON AB TWENTY SIX FORTY TWO AT THIS TIME AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS FOR ALTERING THE BILL. AND PRIORITIZING THE SUIT YOU DURING THIS- OKAY IT'S PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THE- THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. IS NECESSARY FOR LONGTIME VIABILITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ECONOMY FARMS AND RANCHES IN ENVIRONMENTS. BUT NO ONE SAID A CHEATING THE GOALS OF THE AT CIGNA IS. WILL BE EASY. AND IT WILL COME WITH SIGNIFICANT DESTRUCTION IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE. IN FACT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA ESTIMATES THAT BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES MAY COME OUT OF PRODUCTION OF THE NEXT TWO TO THREE DECADES. AND HOW LOCAL DECISION MAKERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. DEAL WITH THIS DESTRUCTION. CAN HAVE. YOUTH SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE REASONS WE CAN TURN THOSE LINES INTO LETTERS LINE'S BECOME A LIABILITY OR TURN THEM INTO AN ASSET. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY TWO WILL HELP US TAKE A- THE LATTER PATH OF TURNING THOSE LINES IN THE ASSET BUT PROVIDING INCENTIVES. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS IDENTIFIED FOR. IN THE CHARACTERIZATION GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. BUT PROTECTION OR TWO OR MORE THOSE BENEFITS. THE PROGRAM IS VOLUNTARY. AND WE BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO PLAY A ROLE IN ASSISTING LOCAL AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS IN ACHIEVING THE GEAR- MITIGATING THIS DESTRUCTION EVEN THE GOALS OF CIGNA AND WE RESPECT WE ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GARZA WE HAVE- SOMEONE TESTIFYING OVER THE TELEPHONE AND THAT'S MERRY AND WARMER THAN FROM THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. MISTER MODERATOR. BUT YOU CAN'T MARIANNE RANDOM. FORMER DALY EGGMAN HERE. YES THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING CARA GUARDS THAT AND ASK- TIA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS MERION WARMER GAMMON AND BUYING ON BEHALF OF THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES THE CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY SEVEN THE STATE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE MISTER THOMAS'S BILL TWENTY SIX FORTY TWO THIS MORNING- YES MEASURE PROVIDE ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX FOR HOW WE THINK OF THE LAND USE CHANGES THAT WILL BE. PRECIPITATED BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY PLANS UNDER SIX MONTHS AN RC RC IS COMMITTED EXCEPT FOR IMPLEMENTATION THE CIGNA ARE NUMBER COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THEIR LOCAL GFAP. TEST I WOULD INSURE THAT THE NEEDS THE- IS. DEPENDENT GROUND WATER ARE AT. WELL LIMóN THE DAM DONE TO THE FOR AND RANCHES AND THE ECONOMIES THAT ARE COUNTIES DEPEND ON. AS NOTED BY MISTER GARZA- VARIOUS SOURCES OF ESTIMATED UP TO A MILLION ACRES MAY COME ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT THREE GAMES. AND WITH THAT COMES A CONCERN THAT WE THERE WERE THOSE PLANS APPROPRIATELY. ABOUT FAKE DO BECOME THAT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE LANDSCAPE. COUNTIES WITH THEIR LAND USE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENERAL PLANS HAVE A KEY ROLE IN HOW THOSE CHANGES ON THE LANDSCAPE CAN BE AFFECTED. SAMPLE WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE PLANS. THAT ARE MOST APPROPRIATELY STEWARDED FOR LONG TERM GOOD PRODUCTION WHICH LANDS MIGHT BESTER GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ECOSYSTEMS AND HABITAT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY SIX FORTY TWO BY CREATING A MULTI BENEFIT LAND CONVERSION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. WILL INSIST LANDOWNERS WATER AGENCIES AND COUNTIES WITH ANOTHER TOOL TO ASSESS THE SPECTRUM OF OPTIONS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD FROM INTENSIVELY IRRIGATED KERMIT CROP. FIELD CROPS THE BALLOT LANDS PROVIDING ECOSYSTEM BENEFIT. ALLOWING FOR THIS RANGE OF CONSIDERATION WELL ALLOW THE CAN THE COMMUNITY CHOICES NAY TO MINIMIZE LOTS OF LOTS OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUES WHICH WORK WHICH ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE COUNTY GENERAL FUND. ON ETHNIC TO GUARD THE NOTE IN THIS PROGRAM IS BOND HEARING AND WE BELIEVE IN IT'S AN APPROPRIATE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE OF OPTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FORTY TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOSE ARE TWO WITNESSES- BEEN DESIGNATED IN SUPPORT.

TWO FIVE ONE NINE BUT AFTER WOULD CONSERVATION PROJECTS WE HAVE A WITNESSES THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TESTIMONY VIA TELEPHONE NUMBER AND AN ORDER FROM THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES- CALIFORNIA SO WOOD FLOORS ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWENTY FIVE NINETEEN SEEKS TO ADDRESS A SHORT COMING IN THE GRANT PAYMENT PROCESS. AND CUT THE GREEN TAPE THAT IS PREVENTING RESTORATION PROJECTS AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW GRANT AWARD T. AWARDING MUST FLOW THE COST THE GRANT WAS AWARDED TO COVER AND APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE AWARDING AGENCY AFTER THE FACT. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR A FEW REASONS FIRST THE NONPROFIT SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL ON HAND. TO COVER THE UP FRONT EXPENSES OR THEY QUALIFY FOR A SEPARATE SERB PATIENT MARKET RATE LOAN TO RESOLVE THIS CASH FLOW PROBLEMS. SECOND EVEN IF THEY FIND A WAY TO GET THE PROJECT OFF THE GROUND THEY HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS AFTER THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT. OPERATING WITH THESE COSTS LOOMING OVER THEIR HEADS. THIS IS AN ARDUOUS PROCESS AND SIMPLY NOT REALISTIC. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THESE IMPACTS THIS IMPACTS DISADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE IS LESS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT PROJECTS. THE RESULT IS THAT THE COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS BOTH IN MY DISTRICT IN SOME THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OR UNABLE TO UC'S GRANT DOLLARS EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN AWARDED AND THE IMPORTANT WORK IN ADVANCE IS THE STATE GOALS IS UNABLE TO BE TO PROCEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY COASTAL CONSERVANCY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE 20% 25% OF A GRANT IN ADVANCE. FROM THE FUNDS A CORRECT IF PROJECTS. RESILIENCE DOORS. CORPORATE PRESERVES LANDS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT IMPACT OFTEN AS A LEAD. DOES NOT THE APP OR REQUIRE. ADVANCE PAYMENTS OF MONEY FUNDED BY BONDS LIKE PROPOSITION ONE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT. ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THE AGENCIES CONCERNS ABOUT THE RISK OF PROVIDING ADVANCE PAYMENT. WILL POINT OUT THAT THE STATUS QUO IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF KOBE NINETEEN. IT WILL BE IMPERATIVE TO DEPLOY STATE DOLLARS IN A TIMELY MANNER. HERE TESTIFYING SUPPORT IS KAREN BIRD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF CUT RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT AND MARIAN WARMER DAM SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. WITNESSES MAY PROCEED. A GOOD MORNING BUT THERE AND NUMBER AYE AND KAREN BIRD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA AND. AND WE ARE HERE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF TWENTY FIVE NINETEEN OF BOTH BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET LOCAL CONSERVATION DONE BUT ALSO IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL AS PART OF THE RECOVERY EFFORT AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS. FOR A LOCAL DISTRICT. I CALIFORNIA'S COMES OVER NINETY FIVE ARE JUST AFTER TWENTY FIVE REPORTS ON DEBATE BUT THE RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL ACT ACT EXPERT ON THE GROUND AND MAKING CONSERVATION HAPPEN EVERY DAY- AS WELL AS EMPLOYING PEOPLE AND KEEPING AND KEEPING FOLKS WORKING. SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CASH FLOW WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND- THE PROJECT THAT ARE KEEPING AT PEOPLE FACE THAT ARE KEEPING FIRES AND FOR A FIRE FROM HAPPENING. IN FOR IT AND ALL THE KEEPING PEOPLE AN EMPLOYEE DOING THOSE JOBS. AND WAITING FOR GRANT THAT THE PAY AS BACK FOR THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING REALLY HAMPERED OUR ABILITY TO GET THE WORK DONE IT KEEPS US FROM BEING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. AND IT KEEPS US FROM DOING THE REALLY IMPORTANT WORK THAT YOU REQUIRE AND MEET OUR NEEDS TO DO- SO WE REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND THIS MORNING IN LISTENING TO IT AND IN THE THINK OF THE BILL.

MATH WE REGRETFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND LAST NAME THAT. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE OF THE TENSION AMENDMENTS AND PRE APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THAT THE BALLPARK. BOBBI IS NOW TO CRIMINALIZE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY WHAT. HELLO LAW ENFORCEMENT ADVANCE AND INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND POTENTIAL PLEASE SOMETHING CARE. AND THE REMOVAL OF BELONGINGS BUT NAY CONSTITUTE AN INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES WELL CONVENTION. AB NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT THREATENS TO PERPETUATE THE CONDITION CONTRIBUTING HOMELESS IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED BY ADVOCATE. JURISDICTIONS AND COURT OF EXACERBATING THE CRISIS. CRIMINALIZATION MAKES IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET HOW OLD DO THE CRIMINAL RECORDS AND THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY TO PAY WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL'S IMPACT AS WE'RE FREE THANKS FOR INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS DIFFICULT AT NINETEEN AND AT THE CDC AND HAD HAVE ADVISED BUT REMOVING HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS COULD FURTHER THE SPREAD OF COKE THAT. THE CIRCUIT IS INSECT CASE THE FEDERAL HER A PROPERTY IS HOME FIRST. AND REMOVING A- WITHOUT EFFICIENCY TO ARE CON. FOR THESE REASONS JOURNAL QUOTE THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS- MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MARTIN AND I AM THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS WITH HOW THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC CALIFORNIA THE NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE THAT NOBODY AT HOMELESS AND EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF INCOME HAS THE STATE'S STABLE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. I AM ALSO SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ABOUT OUR OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WE DID SUBMIT A LETTER BUT ARE NOT LISTED IN THE AND OUT THAT. NO WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS WORK YOU NEED WITHOUT. TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL THREATENS TO FURTHER CRIMINALIZE. OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THAT OUT OF PLACE TO CALL HOME. IN THE MIDST OF AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOME CRISIS THAT HAD BEEN FURTHER EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHAT ALLOW FOR LOCAL AND BOND FORCED ME TO A RACK INCARCERATE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. LIVING NEAR RIVER LACKEY. EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY IT ALSO PERMITS THE STATE FLOOD CONTROL PLAN LOCAL AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PEOPLE BELONGING. BY ALLOWING AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTIONS FROM LEVEES. I WOULD CONCUR WITH THE STATEMENT THE CHALLENGES MADE REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CRIMINALIZATION ON HOMELESSNESS AND THE EXISTING KAPOK IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT A FEW AMENDMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD ALLEVIATE OUR POSITION. OUR OUR OPPOSITION. WE LIKE THE- BURKE HE USED ENFORCEMENT WHERE THE EXTRA OF THE LEFT POSES THE RED TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SECOND TO ALLOW AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS NOTICE WHEN IMMEDIATE SAFETY IS NOT AT RISK TO PUT HIM AT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM COMPLICATING THOSE BELONGING. AND FINALLY TO REQUIRE OF HE THOUGHT THAT THERE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LOCAL HOME WITH THEIR WITH PROVIDER WITH CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND OUT REACH WITH THE GOAL OF OFFERING SERVICES THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE ACT THAT A HOME. WITHOUT THESE AMENDMENTS WE BELIEVE THE BILL TAKE THE PUNITIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AND WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE ARE ALL OF THIS CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO FIND A SOLUTION APPRECIATE THEIR WORK. WITH UP TO THIS POINT AT THAT POINT THOUGH WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANKS THANK YOU THAT'S OUR TWO WITNESSES ASK- AGAINST THE BILL ARE THERE ANY INDIVIDUALS HERE WANTING. TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL- THEIR PRESENT ANYONE. IN THE GEN OUR MOTION BY MISTER MATHIS. SECOND BY MISTER SALAS. LET ME ASK LET ME CHECK AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY INDIVIDUALS- IN THE QUEUE TO REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION MISTER MODERATOR PLEASE. YOU HAVE LINE TWENTY TWO THE BILL HAS. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND NUMBER CAPTURE WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE- BEGETS WITNESSES ALL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER FOR THEIR KIDS. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY OR PROVIDE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THIS TIME THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. THANK YOU. I THINK I HEARD THAT THERE ARE NONE I'LL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE DO HAVE A MOTION- THERE IS A SECOND WE HAVE TO MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK UP. FIRST IS MISTER KALRA. YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU DECEMBER MCCARTY AS WELL AS A MEMBER COOPER AUTHOR THIS BILL- I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL. OF BRINGS TOGETHER TWO DIFFERENT I THINK IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING AS AS A DISTRICT HAS ACTUALLY. HAD FLOODING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I ABSOLUTELY. UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY. OF OUR LEVEES AND SO. I AGREE WITH THE PREMISE THE BILL I ALSO. AGREE THAT HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS IS THE OPPOSITION IS PARTIALLY AS WE- SEE CURRENTLY AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR AN INCREASE IN OUR HOMELESSNESS POPULATION- MEANT TO BE SENSE OF THAT ISSUE AS WELL. IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR OPPOSITION- HAVING CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE OFFER THE BILL I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN NARROW IT A LITTLE BIT MORE- THAN IT CURRENTLY IS WRITTEN IN TAXED. TERM OF. WE HAVING A DESTRUCTION. OF THE VIEW A LETTER YOU. DE CLEARLY THERE'S DAMAGE OF CUTTING INTO A LEVY. THAT IMPACTS THE INTEGRITY. IT SHOULD BE THERE THERE SHOULD BE ABOVE THE AUTHORITY. FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE. TO SPOT AT. YOU TO. IT'S ABOUT THAT CAN BE I'M HOPEFUL BY THE TIME THIS BILL REACHES THE FLOOR GIVE THE COST CON HAPPENING THAT THE BALANCE WILL BE AND I LOOK FOR SUPPORT THE BILL ON THE FLOOR WITH MORE NEARLY CRAFTED TAX THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME MEMBER VINCE. CLARKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ASK THE BILL PRESENTED I RECOGNIZE WHAT THE AUTHOR BUT THE BILL PRESERVED MAYBE SPEAK TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT GLOBALIZATION. OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH SHOULD BE A CONCERN THAT I SHARE AS WELL. MATT PLEASE. YEAH THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. SO LIKE I CONSIDER THE SO YOU HOUSING CALIFORNIA. PART OF MY POLICY AGENDA SO. IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING US ON OTHER SIDE I DO REPRESENT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. AS OUR SPEAKER SAID. OUTSIDE NEW ORLEANS THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY. IN AMERICA AS FAR AS FLOODING. IN PEOPLE WOULD DIE WITHIN OUR STATE THE LEVEES FOR. PEOPLE LIVE UP IN THE THOMAS IN THE POCKET. WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT IF HE'S LIKE IT IT'S ARE SERIOUS THREAT WE HAVE HERE. FOR A LOCAL AREA. AND THERE ARE THERE ARE REACHED. IT SHOULDN'T A CRIME TO BE. MISSION DEALING TO BE POOR. IT SHOULD BE A CRIME TO BE HOMELESS MISSION CRIMINALIZE HOMELESSNESS BUT THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T. SLEEP OUTSIDE OF THE STATE CAPITOL AT NIGHT. THEY MAKE A MOVE ON. YOU CAN'T SLEEP IN A STAIRWELL UNDERNEATH A SCHOOL BECAUSE IT IT IT HAS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THERE ARE. LIMITED RESTRICTIONS IN THIS SAYS IF YOU ARE IN THE LEVY AREA. NOT A LITTLE BIT BACK FROM THE LEFT IN THE TREES. ALONG THE LEVY AND PHYSICALLY KEEP IF YOU KNOW DIG INTO IT AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LEVY. THAT CAUSES A THREAT TO ALL OF US HERE AND SO- THIS IS ACTUALLY- CLARIFIES NINETEEN FORTY POLICY. RECLAMATION DISTRICT- HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON FOR YEARS AND GIVES MORE CLEAR CLARITY TO OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN A PREVIOUS AS WHAT YOU CAN DO TO ENFORCE POLICY- YOU WANT ANYTHING ELSE MISTER DO. IN A CAN I UNDERSTAND THAT PORTS OF SAFETY I SERVE WOULD. ANYTHING THAT PROTECTS- CALIFORNIANS BUT SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE CRIMINAL ON ASKING HEALTHY WITH THAT YEAH. THE CRIMINAL THIS IS AN EXISTING LAW YEAH SURE THANK THANK YOU APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY- THAT THE EXISTING LAW WAS WITH THE PROXY NINETEEN FORTY THREE WHEN IT WHEN IT WAS MADE IN THE FLIGHT SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY- AUTHORIZES. AND BUILT AND BACK THEN IT WAS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES- THIS IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- ALMOST A CAMPING IN THE LEVEES CREATES. A GREAT UNCERTAINTY FOR INSPECTORS- IT IN AND- AND THE REST THAT YOU THAT WE DISCUSSED REAL. ABOUT THEM JUST TO LET. THE INTENT IS NOT TO CRIMINALIZE HOMELESSNESS- IS NOT TO PROSECUTE BUT MERELY TO. PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INSPECTORS TO GET AND MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DAMAGES IF THERE IS WE NEED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIGH WATER. RETURNS AND AS YOU KNOW MOTHER NATURE HAS NOT DETECTABLE AND SO THAT'S THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU HEARD EARLIER- IT JUST PRESENTS- A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF MOTHER NATURE GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF WIN DAMAGES DO OCCUR WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT WE CAN'T SEE IT- THERE'S NO TIME FRAME THAT THAT REALLY LENDS ITSELF TO THAT. SO FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE OF IN MY DISTRICT WE WISH WE HAD WATER- AND SO THIS IS NOT A CONCERN THE MEAN ESTIMATE INTERFACE WE DO HAVE HOMELESS. ARE THEIR ACTIVATION TO THE LEFT BUT PEOPLE WHO SHELTERED. IN ALL WAYS EXCLUSIVELY ON SHOPPING IN. I COULDN'T. THAT THAT. I WOULD SAY THE THERE THERE'S PEOPLE WHO IF THEY'RE OUT THERE THEY HAVE SHOWN. HI ARE YOU ASKING IS THERE ARE THERE UNLAWFUL SEE THROUGH THE CHAIR. YEAH I YOU ASKING THERE ON. ACTS TODAY THAT ARE DONE BY PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT HOMELESS CORRECT PROBABLY NOT OKAY I NOT PEOPLE THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE OUT THERE WITH A SHOVEL DIGGING. DIGGING IN AND LET'S FACE IT THE CONDITIONS ARE HORRIFIC IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE AT HOME. SO I DON'T I DON'T NECESSARILY- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO TO PUT IT IS INDIVIDUALS ON A NEGATIVE LIGHT BUT IT IS A REALITY OUT THERE AND IF YOU LITERALLY WALK TWO MILES FROM HERE. IN LESS THAN A HALF HOUR WE COULD GO SHOW YOU AREAS WHERE INDIVIDUALS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE DUG OUT PORTIONS OF THE LEVY AND NEEDED- UNSTABLE. SO THAT PRESENTS A THREAT TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE WHEN A SENSE OF THE SO YOUR QUESTION WAS IS THERE SHELTERED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE LEVY SYSTEMS OFF THE ANSWERS YET. AND NO YES YEAH THIRTY THERE ARE THERE TO RESIGN CAN YOU TO STATE YOUR NAME ON KEVIN CAME RIGHT IS OR WHAT THE- THERE ARE AND THERE'S A PER PROCESS FOR THAT. INCIDENT AS WE GOT MISS BACK WHETHER IT'S A HOMEOWNER PUT AN OFFENSE FOR GATE ON THEIR PROPERTY OR PLACING ROCK IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PERMIT FOR THAT. AND THEY'RE DIGGING TO PROVIDE EXCAVATIONS ABSOLUTELY ON TOP. AND SO THIS IS. NECESSARY HOMELESSNESS THIS BILL CLARIFIES LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE. THAT OWN PROPERTY. THAT ARE OCCUPYING THE- THERE ARE NOT SO APPLIES TO ALL IT'S NOT JUST HOMELESS BILL IN THIS IS WHERE THE NEAR COUNTY CHANGED YES THE LYRICIST IS IMPACTED BY HOMES AND THE PROBLEM IS SO THAT I. COMMITTEE MEMBERS POINT OF NARROWING IT DOWN TO THE MAYBE THE VISUAL THERE THAT'S A TOOL WE HAVE THREE X. RAY LAST YEAR THAT THE IN HAD FALLEN THAT WERE COVERED UP. WE CAN SEE THAT UNTIL INVOLUNTARILY THAT WE CAME BACK THREE DAYS LATER TO REPAIR THE SITE IT WAS COVERED AGAIN WE NEVER SEEN I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY SO ANYWAY THERE ARE SOLDIERS. THANK YOU FOR THAT POINT IN. AND THAT'S IT THE PERSONALLY TO ME THAT THE RULES OF THE CREATING THE STATE SIDE EVERYONE EQUALLY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT FOR THOSE THAT THE CONCERNS RECOMMENDATION OF ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE CREATING A LOT OF THE ONLY APPLY TO THE HOMELESS. WOULD ONLY DIRECTLY IMPACT AND OF THAT WOULD BE A HUGE PROBLEM FOR THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT THERE INDIVIDUALS. OF ALL HOUSING TYPES A SHELTER. FOR HOMELESS LAW WOULD APPLY FOR A PROGRAM YOU WOULD APPLY IT THAT YOU WOULD FORCE AGAINST AND DAD. WHAT IS SO INFURIATING I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THAT ON THE RECORD TO GET SOME SUPPORT TODAY- I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR. MATTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE CREATING HERE IS NOT A DOUBLING DOWN OF THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT WE KNOW DEL. SOL HOMELESSNESS- WHAT I FIND IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE TO PEOPLE LIKE SIMPLISTIC SOLUTIONS FOR. AND SIMPLY WALKING THESE FOLKS OUT AS WE KNOW IS NOT A STRATEGY AND IMPORTANTLY IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY NINETY DAYS. SO I RESPECT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DON'T KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT LEVEES AGAIN NOT A CONCERN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SO I WILL SUPPORT. THE BILL TODAY- BUT I WILL ASK FOR CONTINUE MY CASE TO MAKE SURE IF YOU CAN STAND UP SAY LIGHT OF DAY. THIS IS NOT AN- THE MOST. AMONG US A IT WILL LOOK FOR THE SCENE DOES NOT.

AND TO ASK THE HIS WITNESSES- HE- PREPARED IF THAT- TO THE WILL TESTIFY IN PERSON. AND THEN WE ASK THAT THOSE WHO CALLED WHO WILL BE CALLING AND SUPPORT PLEASE UP. FOR DOING SO AT THIS TIME- MISTER BLOOM THE FLOOR IS YOURS. A WITNESS% MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU- AND- COULD MORNING MISTER TURNER CALLING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE THIS MORNING. WHICH IS A BILL TO RESTORE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WATERSHEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE BUILT. ON A LAW THAT I AUTHORED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT RECOGNIZE THAT WATERSHEDS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND A LOT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD PASSED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALL FOR AN ASSESSMENT AND PRIORITIZATION. OF THE RESTORATION NEEDS IN THE WATER SHOWS THAT FLOW INTO SHASTA TRINITY AND- FOR A BILL RESERVOIRS. THESE LARGEST RESERVOIRS FORM THE BACKBONE OF THE STATE'S WATER SYSTEM PROVIDING UPWARDS OF. ATWATER TO UPWARDS OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE AND MOST OF THE IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS PROPOSAL CREATES AN INTER AGENCY SHASTA TRINITY OR OF WILL WATERSHED RESTORATION ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD BE HOUSED AT THE WATER BOARD TO COORDINATE RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION INVESTMENTS IN THIS REGION. LED BY A STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE KEY ORGANIZATIONS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ESTABLISH AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO EFFICIENTLY EXECUTE THE RESTORATION PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. IT WOULD ALSO MAKE DIRECTED GRANTS FROM THE EXISTING HEADQUARTERS RESTORATION FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. THE RESTORATION OF THESE WATERSHED WILL PLACE THEM IN THE BEST CONDITION POSSIBLE TO REDUCE FIRE IMPACT IMPROVE WATER SECURITY ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND ASSIST AND SUSTAIN THEIR LONG TERM HEALTH. THE EXECUTION OF THIS PLAN WILL ALSO SERVE AS AN ECONOMIC DRIVER CREATE JOBS IN A PART OF THE STATE WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. AND SOME SAY THAT THE STATE IS ALREADY MAKING INVESTMENT IN THE REGION SO WHY DO WE NEED THIS NEW INTER AGENCY EFFORT THAT'S A VALID QUESTION. BUT IT'S A MATTER OF HAVING A PLAN AND A SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE OUR GOALS AT SCALE. DURING THE CLOVER CRISIS OUR ATTENTION IS RIGHTFULLY FOCUSED ON DIRECT RESPONSES TO OUR MOST PRESSING NEEDS. AND IN ITS WAKE THE PANDEMIC IS PUT MANY OF OUR PRIORITIES AND NEEDS AS A STATE ON HOLD. BUT CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE FIRE WATER SECURITY AND ROCK RELIABILITY AND THE NEED FOR JOBS. WILL NOT WAIT AND WE MUST CONTINUE TO EXPEDITIOUSLY PREPARE OUR STATE FOR AND IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS TO THESE ONGOING CONCERNS. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE IS A STRATEGIC AND EFFICIENT APPROACH BASED ON A DATA DRIVEN ASSESSMENT. THAT WILL SERVE AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR STATE ONGOING RESPONSE TO THESE ISSUES. I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPOSED ADMINISTRATION IS INCLUSIVE AND REPRESENTATIVE OF LOCAL INTEREST EXISTING PLANTS. AND THE WORK THAT IS ALREADY BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE REGION. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE IS MEANT TO BE COMPLEMENTARY TO THOSE EFFORTS AND AGAIN I'M COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THAT IS THE CASE. IN FACT ONLY YESTERDAY. I HAVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH IZZY MARTIN OF THE SIERRA FUND AND JONATHAN TO SOUL OF THIS YEAR INSTITUTE WHOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONDUCTING RESTORATION WORK IN THESE WATERSHEDS. AND WHILE THEY HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AT THIS TIME. I THINK WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE OVER ARCHING GOALS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE. AND WE'VE AGREED TO CONTINUE MEETING BEGINNING WITH NEXT WEEK. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. AND MAKE THE WATERSHED RESTORATION ADMINISTRATION AND EFFICIENT MEANS OF FACLITATING THE ESSENTIAL WORK THAT MUST BE COMPLETED OUR STATE MOST IMPORTANT WATERSHEDS. I'M PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME LAURIE WAIVER THE PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC FOR STRESS TO TESTIFY WHAT. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIR GARCIA AND VICE CHAIR DOLLY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN PARTICULAR MR BLOOM- AS WELL AS THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES FOR PREPARING THIS HEARING. AS WE SEE ALL AROUND US- WITH THE VARIABLE WEATHER AND WITH. THE EXACERBATIONS OF ISSUES CAUSED BY THE CURRENT CRISIS. CALIFORNIA HAS A SERIES OF ISSUES THAT ARE URGENT A NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND MANY AMONG THEM OUR- FIRE RISK REDUCTION. WHAT A RELIABLE. CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUPPORTING THE ECONOMIES AND UNDERSERVED REGIONS OF THE STATE. THIS BILL SETS FORWARD A PATH TO DEAL WITH THOSE PROBLEMS AT SCALE. AND DEALS WITH THEM IN THEIR LINKED FASHION. IT WILL ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ADDRESSING UNDER EMPLOYMENT IN A CRITICAL REGION OF THE STATE THAT STANDS OUT BOTH IN STATE AND NATIONALLY FOR UNDER EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS ANOTHER DROUGHT HERE. IT IS A YEAR WHERE WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE A PROLONGED AND INTENSE FIRE SEASON AGAIN. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE YEAR FOR OF THE STATE'S FIVE MEGA FIRES WERE IN THIS REGION COSTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ADDRESS AND TENS OF BILLIONS TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF RECOVERY. FAR IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS OUR WATER SUPPLY. THURGOOD ON THE GROUND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS BUT THERE ARE TOO FEW TOO SMALL AND TOO SLOW TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT THE SCALE THAT IS NEEDED. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE ESTABLISHES A COORDINATED INTER AGENCY OFFICE AND TEAM. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN THESE WATERSHEDS OF THE DAMS. THAT SERVES THE CORE OF THE STATE'S WATER SYSTEM. IT IS TO BE SUPPORTED BY AN DVISORY COUNCIL WHICH INCLUDES DEEP ON THE GROUND LOCAL EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE AND INTERESTS AND THAT IS INITIALLY DESCRIBED ONLY IN THE BILL A PRESENT AS THE AUTHOR HAS IDENTIFIED IS VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH ADDITIONAL INTERESTS AND HAVE THEM INTO THAT. EVERYBODY LOVES OUR WATERSHEDS BUT THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THERE IS NO ENTITY THAT HAS RESPONSIBILITY. TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WATERSHEDS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT. IT SETS OR WILL SET CLEAR TARGETS IN ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY RESTORING THESE WATERSHEDS TO THEIR BEST POSSIBLE FUNCTION. IT IS TO BE HOUSE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD BECAUSE THAT ENTITY HAS BOTH THE EXPERIENCE OF DEALING WITH LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND THE ABILITY TO HANDLE THE KINDS AND SCALE OF FINANCING THAT WILL BE NEEDED. TO MAKE THIS EVER COME TO PASS. THERE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE STATE REVOLVING FUNDS OF THE CLEAN WATER DRINKING ACT AND THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT- POSITION IT TO HELP TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EMERGING FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY. FUNDING AND PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS THAT ARE BOTH ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S A VERY TIMELY BILL ADDRESSING AN URGENT NEED TO REDUCE FIRE RISK TO ENHANCE OUR WATER SECURITY AND RELIABILITY IN THE STATE WATER RELIABILITY IS INDEED THE LIFEBLOOD FOR MUCH OF THE ECONOMY. IN THE STATE. IT SETS FORTH A NEW PARADIGM AND PATH FORWARD ADDRESSING BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM RISKS AND IT WILL INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND. IT WILL INCREASE SAFETY WATER RELIABILITY AND MOVE FORWARD OUR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION EFFORTS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU- YOU HAVE YOU SAID YOU HAD ONE WITNESS- THAT WILL BE SPEAKING I'LL ASK IF THERE ARE ANY INDIVIDUALS. THAT APPEAR PRESIDENT- IN THE CHAMBERS AND WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE.

I LIKE THE FIRST THING- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL THE COORDINATION WITH. SO OTHER OF A THE COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT NATURAL RESOURCES JUDICIARY. ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. KNOWS A LOT OF WORK SO THANK YOU- BUT I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE ZERO ZERO FIVE THE- EXPEDITED. DAM SAFETY FOR SILICON VALLEY ACT. SO IT'S LAST TIME I WILL SAY THAT. TITLE BUT THIS BILL IS AN URGENCY BILL- AND SEEKS TO ENACT CHANGES IN STATE LAW CHANGES. THIS YEAR. TO HELP FACILITATE THE EXPEDITED REHABILITATION OR SEISMIC RETROFITS TO ANDERSON DAM. THIS ISSUE AND DAM CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT INTO THE LARGER. SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND THE SILICON VALLEY REGION. MY FIRST THIS IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE. THIS BILL INVOLVED A LOCAL DAMAGE TO MENTION THE ANDERSON DAM. AT THIS DAM WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY IS LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IT HAS A CAPACITY OF NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND ACRE FEET IS THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA. AND IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SILICON VALLEY'S DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. I MENTIONED THAT THE DAM WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY. AND IT WAS BUILT TO THE SAFETY STANDARDS OF THAT TIME. BUT AS WE NOW KNOW THE DAM WAS CONSTRUCTED ALONG TO EARTHQUAKE FAULT LINES. THE CALAVERAS FAULT WHICH IS A MAJOR BRANCH OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT SYSTEM AND THE DAM ALSO SITS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE COYOTE CREEK PAULINE. SECOND THIS ISSUE IS A REGIONAL ONE AS I STATED THIS DAM IS THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND IT'S A CRITICAL PART OF THE SILICON VALLEY. THE SILICON VALLEY DRINKING WATER SUPPLY. WHEN ANDERSON DAM WAS COMPLETED IN NINETEEN FIFTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE. AGRICULTURAL REGION WITH A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND. AND AS WE ALL KNOW NOW THE CARD COUNTY. IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL HUB OF THE TECH ECONOMY WITH A POPULATION NEARLY TWO MILLION. THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THE COUNTY SEAT IS CURRENTLY THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA THE TENTH LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF POPULATION. AND THIS AND THE SCENT OF A REGION HOME OF THE SILICON VALLEY IS A VITAL CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMY. AND IS EDISON DAM ISSUE POSES SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR THE REGION. THE DAM HAS SOME SERIOUS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ISSUES. IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE THE BRIDGE OF THE DAM AT FULL CAPACITY WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. IN THAT SCENARIO IS PREDICTED THAT FROM THE SIDE OF THE DAM. FLOODING WOULD EXTEND MORE THAN THIRTY MILES NORTHWEST TO THE SAM CISCO BAY. IMPACT IN THE CITIES OF SAN JOSE SANTA CLARA. SUNNYVALE IN MILPITAS. AND FLOODING WOULD ALSO EXTEND ANOTHER FORTY MILES SOUTHEAST TO MONTEREY BAY. IMPACT IN THIS IS A MORGAN HILL GILROY IN WATSONVILLE. AND WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY WHY DID YOU DO THIS BILL. THIS IS A DISTRICT ISSUE. WITH REGIONAL IMPACTS THAT REQUIRE IMMEDIATE STATE ACTION. AGAIN THIS BILL AB THREE ZERO ZERO EIGHT IS AN URGENCY BILL. IT'S AN URGENCY BILL BECAUSE ON FEBRUARY TWENTIETH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION BURKE. ISSUED A DAM SAFETY DIRECTIVE REQUIRING THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT OR VALLEY WATER. ASSET TO FULLY DRAW DOWN ANDERSON DOWN STARTING OCTOBER FIRST OF THIS YEAR. NOW ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL ORDER THIS DIRECTIVE IS UNAVOIDABLE. BECAUSE BASED ON THE NEW INFORMATION REGARDING THE DAM SEISMIC VULNERABILITIES THE DAM SAFETY RISK IS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. ACCORDING TO THE COMMISSION THE RISK AT THIS PROJECT TO DOWNSTREAM LIFE AND PROPERTY IS EXTREME. A CATASTROPHIC EIGHT CATASTROPHIC DAM FAILURE COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AS A RESULT SUCH OF THESE DECISIONS MUST BE MADE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY BE THE PARAMOUNT FACTOR. IN A LETTER TO THE WATER DISTRICT ISSUE WITH THIS DIRECTED THE FEDERAL COMMISSION ENCOURAGE THE pDISTRICT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL HASTE. ALL HASTE TO DESIGN IT SECURE THE NECESSARY PERMITS AND COMPLETE THE DESIGN FOR THE REHABILITATION OR RETROFITS TO THIS. THIS FELLOW DIRECTED TO BEGIN DRAINING THE LARGEST RESERVOIR IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA POSES MANY MANY CHALLENGES. DRAINAGE WILL SEVERELY REDUCE WATER RESERVES GROUNDWATER BASINS IN THE COUNTY COULD BE IMPACTED INCLUDING IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOSE MORGAN HILL SAN MARTINE IN THE CITY OF GILROY. AND FOR A STATE PRONE TO DROUGHT THIS IS A PROBLEM. THIS DRAINAGE WILL ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THE FISH WILDLIFE AND ENVIRONMENTS. AGAIN THIS URGENCY BILL SEEKS TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING AND CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION IMPROVEMENTS TO ADDRESS IN DOWN. IF YOU CONSIDER THAT THE WATER DISTRICT INITIATED THIS SEISMIC RETROFIT PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IF THE DISTRICT IS ABLE TO USE THE MECHANISMS IN THIS URGENCY BILL. THEY SHOULD BE IN A STRONG POSITION TO CONSTRUCT THIS NEW DAM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND IN DOING SO IT WOULD REDUCE THE DURATION OF WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL PROVIDE FOR THE LONG TERM SAFETY. OF THIS REGION. AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS MAYOR MORGAN HILL RICH CONSTANT TIME. AND KURT LEWIN BURGER WITH VALLEY WATER HURT- WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS BILL. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MS RIVER SAID THEY WILL BE TESTIFYING VIA TELEPHONE THE- HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH TO. PROVIDE TESTIMONY- TO THIS MEASURE. PLEASE OPPOSE THE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICHARD COTTON TIE AND I AM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF MORGAN HILL. RGD UP FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IS LOCATED DIRECTLY BELOW ANDERSON DAM RESERVOIR. IF THE DAM WERE TO FAIL WHEN IT IS AT FULL CAPACITY AT THIRTY FOOT WALL OF WATER WHICH SWEEP THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY IN FIVE TO FIFTEEN MINUTES. AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE DEVASTATION THAT WOULD RUN NORTH TO SILICON VALLEY AND STOP THE MONTEREY BAY. THE EARTHQUAKE FAULTS ONE LOCATED ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM THE DAM. AND THE OTHER DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE DAM ARE NOT DORMANT. IN ACT WE HAD A FOUR POINT OH EARTHQUAKE EARLIER THIS YEAR. IMAGINE WONDERING IF EVERY TIME THE EARTH SHAKES IF A THIRTY FOOT WALL OF WATER WHAT HEADING YOUR WAY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT GETTING THIS REMOVED AND REPLACED AT QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR EVERYONE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT STATE. THAT WHY THE CITY OF MORGAN HILL STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY A WITH.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK OF A COLLEAGUES ON THE RUN RIVAS- FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR IT AND I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL AND THE REALITY IS THE DAMAGE BASED UPON THE FAILURE OF THE ANDERSON DAM IS NOT SIMPLY HYPOTHETICAL. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE HEART OF MY DISTRICT IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE AREA. OVER SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF DAMAGE OCCURRED IN AROUND FIVE HUNDRED HOMES AROUND INHABITABLE BASED UPON A SPILLOVER OF THE ANDERSON DAM- NOT A CATASTROPHIC- THAT WOULD OCCUR. SOON TO ME AS LIKE A BAND SO WE KNOW THAT THE DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE. VERY MUCH REAL AND THAT THE AS WAS NOTED. I IN THE TESTIMONY FOR THE FOR GOVERNMENT'S REALLY TO USE ON OUR REGION. FORCING OUR HAND TO QUICKLY EXPEDITE THE DAM RETROFIT AJ. ADDITIONALLY PROVISIONS WAITED TO SEE WHAT AN EXTRA JUDICIAL REVIEW WERE REMOVED- AND SO YOU'LL STILL GET AN APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS. NOW THE PROVISIONS REGARDING THE BEST VALUE CONTRACTOR CAN IN. IN SOME SITUATIONS. RATE PROBLEMS REGARD THE CALL OF WORK THAT ME A CO. ON AND SO. THE FACT THAT- PROVISIONS OF THE BILL PROHIBITS A BEST A CONTRACTOR. FROM BEING PRE QUALIFIED OR SHORTLISTED UNLESS THE CONTRACT PROVIDES ENFORCEABLE COMMITMENT TO THE DISTRICT OF THE CONTRACTOR. AND IS SUBCONTRACTORS EVERY TEAR WOULD USE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE FOR ALL THE WORK IN THE PROJECT. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE THAT THAT PROHIBITION DOESN'T APPLY. A DOLLY WATER WITH A CONTRACTOR OF ENTERED INTO A P. LA AND SUDDENLY IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO TALK TO WORKERS. DURING SURE THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT WILL BE SUCH OF WHAT A PART OF THIS SIZE AND NATURE. DESERVE AND WAS THIS PROJECT IS DONE WERE HOPE IT'LL BE A PROJECT THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME FOR THE NEXT CENTURY OR BEYOND- TO PROTECT. THE WATER SUPPLY AS WELL AS OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE- ALONG THE FLOOD PLAIN. OF THE OF THE RESERVOIR AND THE DAM. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD. LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK.

NEXT WILL HELP ITEM ELEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY SIX FROM OUR CHAIR. SHARE AT THE PRESENT AB TWO SEVEN THREE SIX- THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD GIVE STATE OVERSIGHT OVER ANY HYDRO ELECTRIC ENERGY STORAGE PROJECT WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF DR THREE NATIONAL PARK THE ACCOMPLISHES THE TASK BY REQUIRING PERSON SYSTEM IN A MULTITUDE OF DATA AND REPORTS INCLUDING GROUNDWATER MONITORING AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THE STATE WATER BOARD. THE NATIONAL PARK IS ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL TREASURE TO THE STATE AND MORE SPECIFICALLY TO MY DISTRICT. FIFTY SIX ASSEMBLY DISTRICT OF THE SENATE HEALTH FORMULA. HIS MIND TEND TO DEVELOP A CREATIVE APPROACH FOR THE STATE O MONITOR AND IF NEEDED AND FORCE AGAINST THE PROJECT. IF IT WAS FOUND TO BE HEARD IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE BILL MEET THAT GOAL BY CREATING MEDICATION FUN TO GO DIRECTLY TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RESTORATION THE PARK. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- THE OPPOSITION IS BROUGHT DIRECTLY TO MY ATTENTION- AND ONE IS THAT- THIS BILL. IS NOT WILL NOT- IT BECOME A PROCUREMENT BILL FOR ANY PROJECT- NOT THIS VEHICLE- OR ANY OTHER VEHICLE THAT I MAY BE WORKING ON. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WON'T BE VERY CLEAR WITH MY PUT MY MASK DOWN LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT- SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS YEAR'S NIS BEHIND THAT STATEMENT. I ALSO WANT TO JUST THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE BILL CONTAINS ABSOLUTELY NO LANGUAGE. ABOUT THE PROJECT AND THE PROJECT INCREASING. ANY ENERGY COSTS AND YOU'LL HEAR SOME OF THAT BECAUSE I WAS. DIRECTLY TOLD BY. MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION- ABOUT THIS BILL AS WELL. THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY- SIMPLE V. SIMPLY ADDRESSES ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. BY BOISE IMPOSING MEANING FOR STATE LEVEL SANCTIONS FOR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH GROUND WATER. USE THRESHOLDS MEMBERS. OF THIS COMMITTEE I REPRESENT AN ECONOMICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA. THAT CAN RESOURCE IS EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES. STEMMING FROM OVERALL HONOR INVESTMENT.% COMPARED TO OTHER PARTS OF OUR STATE JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE. IMPAIR ACCOUNT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF OUR DISTRICT- ON A REALLY GOOD DAY. AS 20% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IS THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY- WHAT IT THIS BILL INTENDS TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON. DOES NOT LIVE THAT FAR BEHIND. SO NOW PUT IT INTO CONTEXT DURING THIS- CLUB IN NINETEEN. ECONOMIC RECESSION. AND WE CAN EXPECT THOSE NUMBERS TO PROBABLY STOP. THE HARSH ECONOMIC REALITIES IN THE NEED TO CREATE JOBS. THE EXISTING IN OUR AREA INCLUDING VERY THIS PANDEMIC- THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE INTENSIFIED AS UP THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO RISE. FOR THESE REASONS THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT THAT WILL BRING ABOUT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AS ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER BUT LET ME AGAIN BE VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL. IS ABOUT BRINGING FOLKS TOGETHER TO BUILD A SOLUTION THAT HELPS OUR ECONOMY. AND PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'STHE FOCUS THAT I WANT TO ENSURE THIS BILL ACCOMPLISHES PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND FINDING A CREATIVE WAY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT AND POTENTIALLY ENFORCEMENT IF IN FACT THIS WAS TO EVER MOVE FORWARD INTO A CONSTRUCTION PHASE WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WOULD MEET JEFF HARVEY WHO IS AN ENGINEER HARPER CONSULTING GROUP AND WATER EXPERT AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY RESIDENTS. AND SCOTT LEX REPRESENTING NINETY DOUBLE. SO FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM JEFFREY HARVEY. A GOOD AFTERNOON GERMAN GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THIS TEST ONLY TODAY I AM JEFF HARDY IMAGINE BUYER MENTAL CONSULTANT RATHER THAN AN ENGINEER- ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS SPECIALIZING IN THE CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW LAWS THE VIN SEEK WORK AND ALL OF THE RELATED- MARIO PERMITTING. THAT PERTAINS TO WATER POWER MANY PROJECTS AND A PHD FROM UCLA SPECIALIZING WATER RESOURCES NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT ERROR ENVIRONMENT WHILE AND POLICY. I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH LARGE SCALE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THOSE IN THE DESERT REGION THE CHUCKWALLA VALLEY. AND ALL INVOLVING WATER ENERGY. I WAS HIRED BY EVIL CHRISTY ENERGY IS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR BARBARA PERMITTING. AND WORKED ON THE PROJECT FOR NEEDING WITH BURK AND ALL RELATED STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO COMPLETE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW REQUIREMENTS IN MITIGATION PLANNING. AS MENTIONED I AM- RESIDENT OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND A REGULAR VISITOR TO JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK. I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AS IT FOCUSES STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ATTENTION ON GROUNDWATER USED FOR UNIQUE PROJECT THAT DOES NOT OTHERWISE HAVE STEEP JURISDICTION. THE PROJECT WILL BE DEVELOPED WITHIN EXISTING BROWNFIELD MINE SITE WILL USE UTILIZE A SMALL FRACTION OF THE GROUND WATER FROM THE CHUCKWALLA VALLEY AQUIFER. WATER IS USED TO FILL THE LOWER MINE PIT IN HIS THEN A WORKING FLUID. PUMPED UP FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGHER TO ANOTHER MINE PIT FOR ENERGY STORAGE AND RELEASED BACK TO LOWER AS WAR FOR ENERGY GENERATION PROVIDING UP TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY STORAGE. IT IS UNDERGONE OVER TEN YEARS AND REMEMBER REVIEW INCLUDING A FEDERALLY I. S. THE STATE MARLIN PAPERWORK. AND A FEDERAL. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT. INVOLVING SOME SIX THREE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH. EITHER DIRECT OR- RESPONSIBLY TO SEE STATUS. TECHNICAL ANALYSES OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON BROWN WATER BEING CONDUCTED BY ALL OF THOSE AGENCIES WITH EXPERTISE IN WATER. GROUND WATER IN RELATED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE ENERGY STORED FACILITY WILL USE LESS THAN NINETY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OVER THE THIRTY FIVE YEAR LIFE OF THE PROJECT THAT'S LESS THAN THE AQUIFER. IN CONTRAST THE OLD MINING OPERATION USED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF GROUND WATER BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE.

PROJECTS TOLL ROAD WATER USE OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS LIKE THE PROJECT IS LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF YOUR STORE GROUND WATER USE. EXTRACTED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THAT IS THE HISTORICAL RECORD. THAT FOR USED TO LIMIT THE PROJECT WATER YOU SEEN IN THE LICENSE. WATER TABLE LIES- ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY FEET BELOW GROUND SERVICE HAS NO CONNECTION OVERLYING VEGETATION DOOR HABITAT. AND IS NOT SUPPORTING SPINGS IN THE SURROUNDING MOUNTAIN AREAS THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER ELEVATION.

AROUND THE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM EVAPORATION PONDS AND THROUGHOUT THE CHUCKWALLA VALLEY. FERGUS SAID VERY SPECIFIC LIMITS ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING BY REQUIRING THE PROJECT TO SLOW OR STOP PUMPING. IF SPECIFIC LEVELS OF GROUNDWATER DRAWDOWN OCCURRED IN THOSE LIMITS THAT THEY'VE SET ARE MUCH LESS THAN WHAT OCCURRED WITH THE STORE POPPING IN AND DRAW DOWN. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT GIVES THE STATE AN ACTIVE ROLE MONITORING EFFECTUALLY OCTOBER AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO POPPING RATES OR PUBLICATIONS OR TO SEIZE PUMPING.

IT HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN ARGUED BY THE OPPOSITION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THE PERMITTING OF THIS FRONT OF THIS PROJECT WHEN IN FACT THE STATE WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE. SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR THIRTY CONDITIONS ON THE FOR PERMITS FOR THIS PROJECT. AND FOR APPROVED TWENTY NINE OF THE US. THE ONE THAT WASN'T APPROVED WASN'T APPROVED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO DO WITH PRIVATE SMALL WELLS AND THOSE ISSUES GOT RESOLVED OUTSIDE OF THE FOR PROCESS TO IS RENDERED UNNECESSARY.

NEXT WE HAVE TO OPPOSITION WITNESSES HERE WITH US IN PERSON FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM ME NEIL DOES HE FROM THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING I CHAIR MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE NEIL TO SIDE WITH THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION WELL. I KNOW THE AUTHOR CARES ABOUT JOSHUA TREE- BUT THIS BILL ANALYSIS MAKES PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL AND THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION LAST. MAKES PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BILL NOW FIRST THE BILL CAN'T PROVIDE THE STATE WITH AUTHORITY OVER THIS PROJECT YOU TO FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTION SO IT'S INOPERABLE SECOND DESPITE THE FEDERAL LAW PREEMPTION. THE BILL ACTUALLY AUTHORIZES EAGLECREST THE PUMP MORE GROG GROUND WATERED DOWN THE LIMITS BY CREATING AN EXEMPTION. THIRD DESPITE THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION THE BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE WEEPING ENCOURAGE YOU PERHAPS TO ACTUALLY VIOLATE ITS TERMS BY TREATING. EIGHT A PENALTY SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY LIMITS WHAT THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS CURRENTLY THERE'S NO CAP AT THE STATE. AND FOR THE STATE THIS THIS BILL WASTE MONEY BY MANDATING THE STATE TAKE ACTIONS THAT LIKE I SAID IN THE BILL ANALYSIS THAT IT PREVENTS IT FROM TAKING IT INVITES COSTLY A LITIGATION. WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE RED IN THE BILLIONS WHY WOULD WE BE FORCING A STATE AGENCY TO DO THINGS YOU CAN'T DO. INSULIN BE VERY CLEAR. THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. WAS NEVER CONSULTED ON THE SPELL. THAT CLAIMS TO BE PROTECTING ONE OF OUR COUNTRY'S NATURAL WONDERS EAGLECREST IS NOT FOUND A BUYER FOR ITS THREE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT NUMBER TWO DECADES BECAUSE UTILITIES AND REGULATORS. HAVEN'T FOUND IT TO BE NEEDED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER THAT WOULD OVERDRAFT GROUNDWATER AT JOSHUA TREE. SO THAT'S WHY THE COMPANY OF COMPASS LEGISLATURE THREE TIMES NOW. ASKING FOR A BAIL OUT IN THE MOST RECENT ONE DYING LAST WEEK. SO I JUST CLOSE BY SAYING I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR AND HONEST WITH OURSELVES THAT THIS IS NOT. AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BILL- WE ASK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE ALL OF YOU EVERYONE HERE BACK IN HERE WE ARE ALL EQUAL OWNERS OF JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK. IF WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOWARDS ITS PROTECTION. LET THEM ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. NEXT IS CHANCE MUCH IN JONES. MADAM CHAIR AND THE GERMAN GARCIA ON JANICE MONEY JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCER- MASS TODAY LIKE ZORRO- BUT REPRESENTED A BROAD COALITION OF INDUSTRIAL- AGRICULTURAL- RAPIER GROUPS AS WELL AS WELL AS MUNICIPAL UTILITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ALL OPPOSING SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE TREATMENT FOR THE EAGLE MOUNTAIN PUMPED STORAGE PLANT- THE SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE- OF THIS BILL THAT SEEMS TO BE. LIMITED TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP THAT CRITERIA THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT'S BEEN COPIED ON THE FORK LICENSE OF FOR- THE EAGLE MOUNTAIN A PROJECT AND- WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT- THE- THAT THE THAT THIS PLANT THAT THAT THIS- LEGISLATION DOES NOT TURN INTO SOMETHING ELSE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS PLAN IS NOT A GIVEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS IT'S GONNA GET BUILT THE- SORT OF URGENCY OF IS BILL- IS SOMEWHAT CURIOUS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF FOR BASICALLY A KNOWLEDGE AND THAT HE WILL NOT GUT AND AMEND THIS BILL TO TURN IT INTO A PROCUREMENT BILL. FOR THIS PROJECT- AND- WE ARE CONCERNS I HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED HERE- BASED ON THE FINDINGS THAT WERE FIND BUT WE ARE NOT THAT TO SUPPORT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY OF FINDINGS A AND B. WHICH WATER FAR BEYOND PROTECTION OF BROWN WATER RESOURCES AND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO FOR THE GROUND WATER RESOURCE THIS. WINTER WHAT HERE'S THE EIGHTY HAS HAD A TIME FINDING A BY WERE HELPFUL THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE HAD FOR. LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPTS- TO BE WE SUPPORT- EAGLE MOUNTAIN- IS ESTIMATED THAT SO THIS IS WHAT BILLION. ALL THREE. WOULD HAVE. THE COST OF THE PLANTS WE ENDED. SO STRAIGHT AT FOR. WHICH WILL BE PAID STATE WIDE ALL YOUR CAN. pOPPOSITE TO THIS BIASED. GROUP OF MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ENVIRONMENTALISTS DOSES OF US WHO BELIEVE IN COMPETITIVE RENEWABLES- AND RAPIER GROUPS- AND SO IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT- WE- ARE ARE BASICALLY ASKING TODAY- FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS. AND AGAIN ONE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND THINK THE- YOU OFFER FOR A KNOWLEDGE AND HE WILL NOT I GOT AN AMEND THIS BILL. BUT IN ADDITION WE WOULD ASK THAT- IS- SPECIFICALLY DECORATIONS THAT A AND B. LIMITED AT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND SUGGEST THAT THIS. BILL IS SOMEHOW WE GOT THE- APPROVAL OF. LEGISLATURE WE DON'T THINK THIS IS THE CASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY THE WAY THIS BILL IS BEFORE THE PEACOCK BUT THE BILL IS NOT. THE CALIFORNIA. PUMP STORAGE AS PART OF THE PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON NOW SO THE PROPONENTS ACTUALLY WANT THIS PROJECT BILL.

SPEAK NEGATIVE TO SOMEONE THAT'S TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY CAN FOR THEIR DISTRICT I ALSO- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THE I HAVE A PRIORITY BILL MAYBE THIRTY THIRTY WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT PRECIOUS LAND SIMILAR TO THAT OF THAT SURROUNDS JOSHUA TREE AND SO I APPRECIATE UP MISTER SHARES OPENING THAT THE IS NOT THE INTENTION FOR THIS TO BECOME A PROCUREMENT OR ENERGY THE CURRENT TIE BILL BUT TO PUT FORTH SOME. FORM OF A SET OF GUIDELINES REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE FOR A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS OF WELL WHAT ONE OF THE I GUESS COMMON FOOD AND WE CAN TALK FURTHER ABOUT THE SOUNDS GOOD TO THE HEARING IT IS IN REGARDS TO- WHETHER THE BILL IS REALLY NECESSARY- GIVEN THAT THERE'S FEDERAL GUIDELINES IN PLACE- AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU IT AND I'LL JUST ASK A QUESTION YOU CAN COMMON AS YOU SEE FIT- WHAT WHETHER THE BILL GIVES. IN AND WORKING WITH THE WATER BORDER OR THE SOME OF THE- GUIDELINES FOR BY THE WATER BOARD. IS ACTUALLY GIVE US THE ABILITY TO DO. THE SAME MORE OR LESS THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS THIS PROJECT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT. I KNOW THAT IS A CONCERN TO YOU AND MANY OTHERS IS MAKING SURE THAT WE STILL. RETAIN SOME AUTHORITY- TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY THAN WHAT. IF ANYTHING THE BILL DOES IN THAT REGARD. AND THE OTHER- ASPECT OF IT IS. IN THE IN FINDINGS ONE A ONE BEGIN AGAIN IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAPPEN. DISCUSS HERE RIGHT NOW WE CAN DISCUSS. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS HEARING ARE THERE ARE REFERENCES- THAT GO BEYOND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGARDING- THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT- AND SO. THAT'S SOMETHING I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT- IF IT'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THAT IS THE KEY. COMPONENTS TO THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION THAT I'M ORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU- AS WELL AS THE- THAT PROPONENTS AND OPPOSITION. MAKE SURE THAT- WE CAN TRY TO BRING OF ONE OF THE TABLE WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU'VE INDICATED TO ME. PERSONALLY OF IS A GOAL OF YOURS AND CERTAINLY OF MINE AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE. IS A LEASE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER. AS TO WHAT IS IT WHAT IS NEEDED TO PROTECT. THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECT THIS IMPORTANT NATIONAL AND STATE RESOURCE AND SO- I- YOUR COMMITMENT AND- LOOK FOR TO WITH YOU MORE. FOLLOW THROUGH AND FOR THAT AS- WELL FORWARD. THAT IT. HOLDS TO THE GOALS THAT. SEEMS TO CREATE A NEW REGION I STANDARDS OF FOUR OF. FOR REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAVE. WITH ANY POTENTIAL PROJECT ARE. THAT THEY'D PROTECTION JOSHUA TREE THE SURROUNDING AREA IS PARAMOUNT. THANK YOU. MR LIVE. AT THE YOU MADAM ICEI DO HAVE A FOR THE THAT THAT HAD THE EXPERTISE ON THE- THE REMEDIATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS. SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU ANSWER IF YOU COULD JUST PLEASE RE INTRODUCE YOURSELF JEFF HARDY YOU ADDRESSED ENERGY AND NEXTERA ENERGY RESOURCES THANK YOU. I DON'T WANT TO LEAD YOU THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOWING WHAT MY CONCERNS ARE SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY CONCERNS ARE AND THEN YOU EVEN. MAYBE A BETTER PLACE TO ADDRESS THEM- WE HAD A WITNESS IN TESTIMONY- ACTUALLY OPPOSED TO A PRIOR BILL TODAY IS HE MARTIN FROM THIS YEAR FIND- IS- I'D MET ON A TRIP TO EMPIRE MINDS- STATE PARK- IN THIS YEAR NEVADA AS- ON A TRIP- A FEW YEARS AGO. WHERE ALONG THE WAY ON THAT TRIP WE WERE REALLY WE WERE ABLE TO DETECT BY SIGHT LEAD- THAT HAD CONTAMINATED- THE FOOTHILLS SINCE MINING OPERATIONS MANY YEARS AGO. AND SO- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINES REMEDIATION OF THEM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU THE STAFF CAN THE MESSAGE THE THING IS THAT THAT BETTER TAKE PLACE NOW TODAY- WITH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND CONTAMINATION FROM. AND I DO WANT TO THROW YOU WHAT I THINK IS A SOFTBALL OF WHAT FURTHER STEPS ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF NECESSARY- IF THIS PROJECT GOES FORWARD THAT WOULD REMEDIATE ANY CONTAMINATION ARE POISONOUS ACTIVITY THAT DID. IN FACT OCCUR. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION EIGHT IS AN ISSUE THAT WAS OF PRIMARY CONCERN TO FORK INTO THE STATE WATER BOARD- THE WHOLE ISSUE OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE. WE DON'T HAVE LEAD THIS IS NOT A WAS AN IRON ORE MINE AND- WE HAVE A FEW CHEMICAL OF A PC GEOCHEMISTRY OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA AND INFORMATION AS YOU CAN YES. AS THE MINING ACOSTA S. IN YEAH SO WHAT THE IS A ONE. MY UNDERSTOOD DID YOU AS WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HI RATE IS. THE BIGGEST ISSUE ROAD DESK. AND DRAINAGE AND THAT THE MINE ADORING. HAVE A HIGH OF IRATE THIS MINE HAS A LOW OF PIRATE. AND HE SAID THAT WE DO HAVE REQUIRE. IN THE FIRST LICENSE FOR IT WHAT WE CALL A PICKET FENCE OF WILDER SO THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF WILLS THE RELOCATED DOWNSLOPE FROM EACH OF THE RESERVOIRS. AND THEY ARE REQUIRED DIG MONTHLY SAMPLES AND TEST FOR WATER QUALITY FROM ANY SEEPAGE LOSSES. AND THEN TO IF THEY'RE WE DETECT THAT THERE ARE WE PUMP THAT WATER OUT. OR WE TREAT THAT- TREATMENT- YOU LOOK TO THE RIGHT VERSUS MOST TREATMENT SYSTEM ALREADY THAT IS ALREADY PART OF THE PROJECT. AND THAT'S DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE WATER QUALITY IN THE RESERVOIRS AT THE LEVEL OF THE WATER QUALITY THAT DIDN'T THAT'S PUT INTO THE RESERVOIRS. WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO LINE RESERVOIRS WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY AN EIGHT FOOT LININGS VERY SUMMER DONE FOR LANDFILL THAT INCLUDES CLAY AND YOU FABRIC LINERS AND THE LOWER RESERVOIR WILL ALSO INCLUDE A- ROLLER COMPACTED CONCRETE DAM. ON ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE EAST MOST PORTION WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN CONTACT WITH ALLUVIUM RATHER THAN BEDROCK IN THE BEDROCK AREAS- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT THE VETERAN FINAL ENGINEERING. BUT IS SUBJECT TO THE RIVER OVER OF THE REVIEW APPROVAL IT IS INTENDED SPECIFICALLY. REDUCE THOSE LOSSES OF THE POTENTIAL. FOR THAT KIND OF REACH. I THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. YEAH I I'M GOING TO. BE SUPPORTING THE BILL MISTER CHAIR HI APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING FORWARD- WHAT I SEE ON ITS FACE IS AN ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOUR YOUR MOTIVES HERE INTENTIONS ARE RE REALLY BEING. CALLED OUT HERE AND THAT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE FOR ANY OF US TO BE. AND YOU HAVE- YOU HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THIS PROJECT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T ALSO BE A SUPPORTER OF OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THOSE TWO HAVE TO BE SEPARATE AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP IN YOUR TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK THAT THOSE DUAL MOTIVES CAN EXIST TOGETHER TO SUPPORT A PROJECT BUT ALSO TO SAY. WE HAVE SHARED ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AND WE WANT TO PUT THEM FORWARD IT REMINDED ME. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL OF- CENTER ATKINS SP ONE LAST YEAR WHICH- I SUPPORTED. WAS GOING TO HOLD- STATE STANDARDS AS HIGH AS PRIOR FEDERAL STANDARDS- THE GOVERNOR HAD VETO THAT BILL- BECAUSE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS ALSO AT THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS BUT CONCERNS ABOUT SOME CONFLICTS. STILL HOVER AROUND THIS BILL AS WELL. BUT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE APPROACHING IT FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE. YOUR YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE YOU'RE PROVIDING A TEST IF YOU WILL OF HOW CAN THE STATE. PUT FORWARD I IT'S ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE SO BEFORE ON A FEDERALLY APPROVED PROJECT. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A TEST THAT'S WORTHY OF PUTTING FORWARD. AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO TRUST YOU OUR COLLEAGUE IN YOUR MOTIVES FOR WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS SO I THINK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DECLARED AS YOU BEGAN YOUR PRESENTATION- BUT ALSO FOR THIS NOVEL APPROACH. OF PUTTING FORWARD OUR VALUES IN THE FACE OF- AT AN UNCERTAIN FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I THANK YOU WHAT MADE MY SHARE TAKE YOU OFF COLLEAGUES. LEVINE FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT- WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO AS THEY WOULD SAY THREAD THE NEEDLE. ON WHAT IS A VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED. OVER THE COURSE OF THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS PROJECT. WHERE I TAKEN THOSE CONCERNS AND I. ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THEM. AND EXPLORE AS I USED TO WORK CREATIVE EARLIER WAYS. TO HAVE THE STATE. HAS A MENTAL SOME ADDITIONAL INPUT AS IT WAS SAID EARLIER TWENTY NINE OF THIRTY. COMMENTS SEVEN GIVEN TO BURKE WITH DOCTOR MAYBE THERE'S- TWENTY NINE MORE. T WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PUT FORWARD I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE. ATTEMPTING TO DO ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. AND I COULD BE IF. AND IN A LOOK AT THE OP. YOU KNOW THAT PUSHED ON DECK OF MY INTEGRITY OR- YOU KNOW MY COMMITMENT TO- THE WORK ON THIS BILL. AND THAT IT BE NOT MOVING INTO A DIFFERENT JOB FORM OF DOWN THE ROAD. BUT I'M NOT IN FACT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS. THAT I DIDN'T HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH ME. TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A PLACE OF COMMON INTERESTS. TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING JOSHUA TREE AND ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERSARIAL AFFECTS THAT COULD HAPPEN IF A PROJECT DOWN THE ROAD APPEARS I APPRECIATE ARE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THEY TALK ABOUT. THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO REGION THE NEEDS THE JOBS I APPRECIATE THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT- WHEN I STAND CORRECTED WITH MR HARVEY'S CREDENTIALS AND HIS BACKGROUND AND EXPERTISE- I APPRECIATE HIM WALKING US THROUGH ALL OF THE- CONDITIONS ARE REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT TO. THIS PROJECT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT THAT'S NOT THIS BILL THIS BILL IS ABOUT HOW CAN THE STATE PLAY A GREATER ROLE. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE I. MANY TIMES APPEAR SACRAMENTO THE POLITICS PLAY OUT QUITE DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND. AND IT WORKS ON ALL SPECTRUM IT'S NOT JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OR NOT JUST LABOR SIDE IT WORKS ALL THE WAY AROUND TO WHERE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. NON LOCAL FOLKS THEY RECOGNIZE THE HURT THAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AND THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD AS IT RELATES TO THE ECONOMY BUT THAT ARE ALSO ENCOURAGING US TO TRY TO FIND A BALANCE. IN ADDRESSING THE LONG STANDING ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS TO THE ISSUE OUT THERE WITH THIS PROJECT. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SOME SAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL I'M ASKING TODAY UP FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE AND NOT JUST A VOTER CURTIS. I MET FOR WHAT. IN THE- TO HELP BRING. FOLKS TO THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY GET TO A PLACE WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. AS I MENTIONED MY BIGGEST CONCERN ISN'T THAT THEIR QUESTIONING MY ANTENNA MY INTEGRITY IT'S THE FACT THAT I HEARD ZERO COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION. THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND HELP US GET TO A BETTER PLACE THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN I'M ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE. AGAIN NOT AS A COURTESY BUT MORE AS A COMMITMENT TO HELP US GET TO A BETTER PLACE TO ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS. AND MAKING SURE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DURING THIS RECOVERY TIME HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING MY AGENT. THAT HASN'T 2520% UNEMPLOYMENT ANY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RIVAL.
