ALL RIGHT WE CAN MOVE ON BACK INTO THE FILE ORDER ITEM ONE THE SENATOR ROBERT RIVAS AB SIXTEEN FORTY THREE AND YOU CAN PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES- THIS LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTY FORTY THREE SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE TAKE A MORE HOLISTIC LOOK. AT THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME HEAT HUMIDITY ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS BUSINESSES AND ECONOMY. AS WE KNOW MANY IF NOT ALL THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT HAVE EXPERIENCED OR ARE EXPERIENCING THE WORSE THE IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME HEAT. IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE I FORESEE OUR STATE IS NOT ACCURATELY TRACKING THE FULL IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT. AS A RESULT WERE UNABLE TO. PROVIDE ADEQUATE- AND TARGETED POLICY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. IT'S BEEN WELL REPORTED RECENTLY THAT EXTREME HEAT EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF WORKPLACE INJURIES FOR INSTANCE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT WORKERS ARE FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY TO FALL OFF OF LADDERS EXTREMELY HOT DAYS. AT THE UP. REPORT TEACHER IN OUR MISCLASSIFIED. WITHOUT ACCURATE REPORTING AND TRACKING OF SUCH IMPACTS WERE CURRENTLY NOT IN A POSITION TO HELP IN MITIGATE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME HEAT. AND I SHOULD KNOW THAT HE RELATED INJURIES ARE ESTIMATED THECOPPER STATE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION PER YEAR. LIKE OTHER LEGISLATIVE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR ON THIS ISSUE SEEKING TO ELEVATE THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM EXTREME HEAT HERE IN OUR STATE. THIS LEGISLATION SIX TWO THOUSAND BY THREE COMMITTEE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME HEAT AND HUMIDITY ON CALPERS WORKERS BUSINESSES AND ECONOMY. IT'S A DESERVE IT THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE STATEWIDE TRACKING ON EXTREME HEAT AND HUMIDITY RELATED ILLNESSES AND DEATHS AND ALLOW THE STATE TO MORE ACCURATELY ASSESS THE FULL IMPACT WITH ME HERE TESTIFIES AFTERNOON IS MICHAEL. LARA DIRECTOR OF THE CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY PROGRAM AT THE STANFORD WOODS INSTITUTE. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU MR CHEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. AND I DIDN'T MEANT IS MAKING THE HEARING WAS AFTER. THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ALLOW FOR UP TO FOUR MISTER COMMENT TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS SPEYSIDE. THERE'S JUST ONE WITNESS OBVIOUSLY THE NEW- THEY CAN HAVE MORE LATITUDE THERE BUT TO PLEASE TWO MINUTES PER WHEN HIS PHARMACY SIDE. THANKS VERY MUCH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA- MINES MICHAEL WARA I AS A SUMMARY OF THIS SAID I DIRECT CLIMB ENERGY POLICY PROGRAM AT STANFORD WHERE. I WORK ON CLIMATE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION ISSUES- AS PART AT WORK I WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR MEMBERS OF OUR- MEDICAL SCHOOL AND- MEDICAL RESEARCH SCIENTISTS ON. ISSUES RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT AND ILLNESSES RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. AND I JUST LIKE TO SAY- THANK YOU READY TO TESTIFY AND ALSO THAT THE COMMENTS I MADE TODAY REFLECT MY VIEWS NOT TO BE STANFORD- DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO AND I STATE pBEST EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO ADAPT WE'RE NOT REDUCING EMISSIONS FAST ENOUGH AND- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LONG BEEN CLEAR THAT GRADUALLY WARMING CLIMATES ARE GONNA MAKE EXTREME OF ANTS LIKE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS EXTREME HUMIDITY EVENTS MUCH MORE COMMON. THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST CERTAIN OF THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE AS WE SHIFT THE MEAN TEMPERATURE GRADUALLY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE ONE IN ONE HUNDRED YEAR EVENT INTO A ONE IN TEN YEAR EVENTS. THE ONE IN A THOUSAND YEAR EVENT INTO A ONE IN FIFTY YEAR EVENT. AND SO EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS ARE LIKELY WOULD INCREASE THROUGH TIME- NEWER SCIENCE INDICATES THAT MUCH HIGHER RATES OF WORKER ACCIDENT AND INJURY- IN ADDITION TO HEAT STRESS DURING TREATMENT EVENTS ARE COMMON- ENDS. WE NEED MUCH MORE STUDY- TO UNDERSTAND BOTH HOW TO DETECT EXTREME HEAT HOW TO- MEASURE ITS IMPACTS AND THEN HOPEFULLY HOW TO PREVENT THEM. A CRITICAL CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS. DEFENSE WHAT EXTREME HEAT MEANS DEPENDS ON CONTEXT DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT- TYPES OF CLIMATES- CREATE DIFFERENT CONTEXT WHICH CAN HE CAN OCCUR. AVERAGE DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO- ARE STRAIGHT AVERAGE AT AN EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND JUST GO IS NOT GONNA MAKE SOMEONE FROM BAKERSFIELD LAKE TWICE- AND SO. WHAT WE NEED CRITICALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL TO REALLY UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACT IS A COMMISSION TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. HOW TO HELP PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHICH CURRENTLY HAVE WIDELY VARYING DEFINITIONS OF THIS. SAFETY ISSUE. TO CLARIFY WHAT APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR DEFINING STREAM HE ARE SO THAT THEN WE COULD DETECT. AND WARN. AND MEASURE IMPACTS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY AND THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT AB. SIXTEEN FORTY THREE WOULD REALLY ENABLE- AND- WITH THAT ALL CONCLUDE BY JUST SAYING THAT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD BOTH FOR CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY. THIS IS GONNA BE IMPORTANT ISSUE AT LEVEL AS WELL IN CALIFORNIA A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HELPING TO DEFINE WHAT THE STANDARDS ARE THAT ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO KEEP OUR- WORK FOR SAFE AND PRODUCTIVE AND DRIVING THE ECONOMY FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM I WOULD LIKETO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR A BI SIXTEEN FORTY THREE.

DEPORTATION FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR A FAMILY MEMBER AND WITHOUT ACCESS INFORMATION FROM A TRUSTED MESSENGER AT THESE FARMWORKERS ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY THREE IS A BILL TO GIVE FARMWORKERS THE ABILITY TO VOTE THE WAY THAT WE'RE USED TO VOTING AND THAT IS- BY MAIL. RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE LABOR RELATIONS ACT TO THE WEIGHTS IT'S STRUCTURED. THERE ARE. ONLY A WHAT'S ONLY ALLOWED IS TO HAVE A POLLING PLACE AT POLLING PLACES ON THE FACILITY OF THE EMPLOYER AND FARMWORKERS ARE NOT REALLY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ABOUT HOME VOTE THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE THEIR OWN WAY INOUTSIDE OF ALL OF THE OTHER EXTERNAL INFLUENCES THAT'S ALL THIS BILL IS DOING IS CREATING A MAIL IN BALLOT. OPTION FOR FARMWORKERS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IN IN UNION ELECTIONS THOUGH STILL WAS DETAILED LAST YEAR BY THE GOVERNOR AND TAKING THAT SERIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR LAST FALL AND NOW WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THAT THEY RAISED. IN TOWARDS THE EXPERTISE OF THE L. R. B. FOR SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. MEET THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS FOR IT BUT ALSO PRESERVE THE ABILITY OF FARMWORKERS TO HAVE THE VOTE THAT DAY SO. WHAT IF AND WITH ME AS A WITNESSES OF WATER MARTINEZ FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FED IT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF OUR BILL AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAY BEGIN MISPERTON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COULD WATER MARTINEZ WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROPS AND IT'S PART OF THIS BILL- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS- CALIFORNIA'S ENACTED MANY NEW LAWS TO MAKE- REGISTERING TO VOTE EASIER. A NEW LAWS THAT GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME AND MORE WAYS TO VOTE. A NEW LAWS TO HELP PEOPLE HELP OTHERS FILL OUT THE BALLOT AS WELL AS NEW LAWS TO LET PEOPLE GATHER BALLOTS AND DELIVER THEM TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THOSE NEW LAWS NOT ONLY STOP VOTER SUPPRESSION. HE'S ALSO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE. ARE THESE LAWS OF. THAT WE CAN INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION WHILE KEEPING ELECTIONS FAIR AND SECURE. THESE NEW LAWS HAVE MADE IT EASIER TO VOTE ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND IN DIFFERENT PLACES REFLECTING HOW PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK TODAY EVEN DURING THE HEALTH PANDEMIC. THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT THE LAW THAT GIVES FARMWORKERS THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND HAVE A UNION. WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THAT WAS FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. BACK THEN THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE COULD VOTE FOR PRESIDENT GOVERNOR OR MAYOR WAS TO PHYSICALLY GO TO A POLLING PLACE ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION. AND YOU HAVE TO BE REGISTERED TO VOTE THIRTY DAYS IN ADVANCE. BUT AS MENTIONED ALL OF THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE LAW GOVERNS. ELECTIONS AND TO DO SO SURE IT FARMWORKERS ARE NOT INTIMIDATED. OR THEIR VOTING SUPPRESSED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS VOTING CHOICE ACT OF A. B.

WITH GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MATTHEW ALONG WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL- WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY THREE- THE BILL- WE BELIEVE IS REALLY NOT ABOUT JUST MAIL IN VOTING- IT RESPECTFULLY AT THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE SICK WITHOUT ELECTION PROCESS. THAT HAS LONG BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT THE SECRET BALLOT ITSELF SERVES AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS FOR THE PART OF OUR FARMWORKERS TWELVE FREE AND ON COURSE CHOICE IN DECIDING TO VOTE EITHERFOR OR AGAINST UNION REPRESENTATION. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY THREE ELIMINATES A FARMWORKERS RIGHT TO A SECRET BALLOT ELECTION THAT IS FREE FROM ANY COERCION FROM A PARTY THAT HAS A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THAT ELECTION. THIS WAS RECOGNIZED BY GOVERNOR BROWN'S VETO OF SB ONE OH FOUR IN TWENTY ELEVEN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S VETO OF SB SEVENTY NINE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND MOST RECENTLY BY GOVERNOR USES VETO IT MAY BE SIX ONE SIX. LAST YEAR. THIS GROUP TO NOTE THAT WHEN THE AYLER WAS CREATED- UFW FOUNDER CESAR CHAVEZ INSISTED THAT THE ACT ENSURE. THAT THE SECRET BATTLE ACTIONS ARE TO BE EXCLUSIVE MEANS FOR REPRESENT RECORD A RECOGNIZING- THE FORMATION OF A UNION.

WARD I LEE HI LEE HIGH PHILISTINE OKAY WELL PLEASE AVAILABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MEMBERS. UP NEXT ITEM FIVE A. B. TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK WHEN EVERY YEAR READY RIGHT. THANK YOU CHAIR KALRA VICE CHAIR FLORENCE AND MEMBERS- OF EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS LEGALIZED BOTH MEDICAL AND RECREATIONAL CANNABIS USE. EMPLOYEES CAN STILL BE DISCRIMINATED GAYS AGAINST IN THE WORKPLACE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS LEGAL SUBSTANCE DURING THEIR DOWNTIME SHOULD SHOW UP TO WORK HIGHER REPAIR. THE WOULD MOST EMPLOYERS CONDUCTED DRUG TESTS THEY TYPICALLY SCREEN FOR THE PRESENCE OF NON PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABIS METABOLITES. WHAT ABOUT YOUR SAID. OKAY THC IS THE COMPOUND IN CANNABIS THE PRODUCE A. S. PSYCHOACTIVE OF CAN MAKE YOU HIGH. ALL RIGHT CERTAIN CHEMICALS MAKE YOU HOT. THE PROBLEM WITH USING A URINE TEST. IS THAT IT CHEST NOT FOR THC BUT FOR THINGS THAT ARE LEFT OVER AFTER YOU HAVE SMOKED THC AND YOU'RE DOWN. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO SMOKE REGULARLY THIS COULD BE A MONTH LATER OF WHICH CERTAINLY DOESN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR WORK- LU WE TEST FOR THC. THEN WE KNOW IT'S LIKE AN ALCOHOL TEST A BLOOD ALCOHOL TEST. IF YOU USE AN ORAL SWAB TEST FOR THC IT'S RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TEST. AND IF SOMEONE IS POSITIVE THEY SHOULD NOT BE AT THE WORK PLACE AND FRANKLY I DON'T THINK I KEEP THEM ON THE WORK FORCE VERY LONG WOULD ADDRESS THIS BY SAYING THAT- YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TEST IS ABLE TO WORK ON THE JOB. AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE SMOKED IN THE LAST MONTH RECREATIONAL AND MEDICINAL- THIS IS A BALLOT SOLUTION WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES AND- IT WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE AS A PROGRESSIVE LEADER ON CANNABIS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS STILL DAMAGED DEAL. ORINGER FROM CALIFORNIA NORMAL AND JESSE GREEN WALL FROM THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION AND MY GOOD FRIEND- DEL WILL START THANK YOU- THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRK RO WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND JOB APPLICANTS FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION FOR LEGAL OFF THE JOB USE OF CANNABIS. ARE IN PARTICULAR THIS BAND'S DISCRIMINATORY URINE AND HAIR METABOLITE TESTS WHICH HANDS ARE MR CORKER'S EXPLAINED DON'T DETECT ACTUAL IMPAIRMENT JOB FITNESS BUT RATHER PAST USE OF MARIJUANA DAYS OR WEEKS PREVIOUSLY IN EFFECT URINE TESTS ARE LIKE LOOKING THROUGH WORKERS TRASH AND FIRING THEM EMPTY BEER. OR LIQUOR BOTTLES WERE FOUND. LET ME SAY SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT CANNABIS METABOLITES ARE NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF PROTECTING JOB SAFETY NOT A SINGLE FTA STUDIES HAS EVER FELT THAT URINE TESTING IS EITHER SAFE OR EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS AND NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND OTHERWISE THAT WORKERSWHO TEST POSITIVE FOR CANNABIS IN THERE YOUR HAVE NO HIGHER RISK OF WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS AND EVEN LOWER RISK IN A COUPLE CASES. ARE LET ME BE CLEAR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT AND NO WAY COMPROMISES THE ABILITY OF EMPLOYERS TO ASSURE A SAFE DRUG FREE WORKPLACE BY OTHER KINDS OF TESTS INCLUDING IMPAIRMENT TESTS AUDITOR. CAPLET BASED PERFORMANCE TEST WAR ORAL FLUID AND BLOOD TESTS THAT DETECT THE ACTUAL PRESENCE T. H. C. FOR THE FEW HOURS WHEN USERS ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE. ORAL FLUID TESTS ARE A LESS INVASIVE MORE ACCURATE AND LESS COSTLY THAN URINE TESTS AND HAVE BEEN FEDERALLY APPROVED BY SAMPSON. AND FINALLY LET ME SAY URINE TESTS ARE HIGHLY OFFENSIVE INVASION OF WORKERS PERSONAL BODILY PRIVACY I MEAN TALK ABOUT COVERT MANDATES. TO FREQUENTLY THESE TESTS ARE MISUSED TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST UNPOPULAR WORKERS MINORITIES AND AFRICAN AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISCIPLINED FOR FAILING THEM OVER TWENTY OTHER STATES HAVE LAWS PROTECTING EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF LEGAL CANNABIS USERS IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW SUIT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSE GRAY WELL LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL HERE ON BEHALF OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS THOUSANDS OF HIM BUT WHO WORK IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. UFCW IS PROUD TO SUPPORT AND THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK FOR AUTHORING AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH CLARIFIES THAT AN EMPLOYER MAY NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE OR A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEE WHO CONSUMES CANNABIS WHEN THEY ARE NOT AT WORK. AND PROHIBITS THE USE OF CANNABIS METABOLITES TESTING OR OTHERWISE CALLED THE HEARING TEST AND OUTDATED AND RACIALLY MOTIVATED TASK FOR ALL EMPLOYEES EXCEPT THOSE WHO ARE EXEMPTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW FOR BEING A SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITION. MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IS NOW LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER MANY PATIENTS AND WORKERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING CANNABIS PRODUCTS OFF THE JOB FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYMENT OR FINDING FUTURE EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF AN OUTDATED AND RACIALLY MOTIVATED METABOLITE TEST. WHICH IS AN EFFECTIVE AT DETECTING IMPAIRMENT AFTER RECENT YEARS WORKERS INCLUDING YOU HAVE SET UP MEMBERS HAVE LONG SOUGHT ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT TO OPIOIDS AND OTHER HARSH PRESCRIPTIONS OR TREATMENTS FOR PAIN OR OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CANCER. WE HAVE WORKERS WHO USED CANNABIS OFF THE JOB FOR MEDICAL AND MEDICAL PURPOSES. BUT WE'RE DISCIPLINED OR TERMINATED FROM THEIR EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY WERE NOT IMPAIRED OUTWARD. WORKERS WHO HAVE HAD A WORKPLACE INJURY A CURRENT LIKE FALLING OFF A LADDER DENIED FROM WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS BECAUSE THEY TESTED POSITIVE FOR CANNABIS. USE DAYS OR WEEKS PRIOR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT DOES NOT LIMIT AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO KEEP A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE AND ACTUALLY PROMOTE A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF CANNABIS AND IMPACT TESTING AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS LIKE ORAL SWABS. THAT DETECTIVE ON THE. DID THAT CAN. USE OF CANNABIS HOURS. I DON'T. THE TABLETS WHICH ATTACKS YOU STAY OR WE PRIOR. AND NOT ACTUAL ON SIGHT IMPAIRMENT WHILE AT WORK. CALIFORNIA HERE USUALLY LEADS THE WAY ON CANNABIS ACCESS ISSUES IS LAGGING WHEN IT COMES TO EMPLOYEE DISCRIMINATION FOR MEDICAL AND RECREATIONAL CANNABIS USE OFF THE JOB. WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO JOIN THE TWENTY OTHER STATES AND PROTECTING WORKERS BY VOTING YES ON AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE BEHALF. THANK YOU.

SORRY MAKE IT UP. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE MATURE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWO ONE EIGHT EIGHT AS A JOB KILLER- OUR PARAMOUNT CONCERN WITH THIS BILL I THINK THE AUTHOR SHARES IT IS WORKPLACE SAFETY- TO BE CLEAR WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO SALIVA BASED TESTING OR MARIJUANA USE OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE- I SHOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE HERE DRAFT AMENDED THE OFFICE OFFICE AND HAD SOME INITIAL TALKS THERE WERE HOPEFUL THAT THESE CAN BE RESOLVED. AND AS A REMAINS WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE TRANSITION TOWARDS NON METABOLITE BASED TESTING- WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO I THINK INCLUDE THOSE TALKS BUT HOPEFULLY FOR- WITH A FRIEND OF MINE THAT WOULD EMPHASIZE THE TWO PIECES OF THIS BILL THAT CAUSES THE GREATEST CONCERN- AND REALLY PUSH IT TO THAT LEVEL FIRST OF THE LOSS OF PRE EMPLOYMENT DRUG TESTING. BECAUSE THE BILL'S PRESENT LANGUAGE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD MAKE THE- PRE EMPLOYMENT DRUG TESTING RELATED TO MARIJUANA SOMETHING THAT EMPLOYERS COULD NOT PURSUE THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR US AND NOTABLY WHAT'S- COPPED OUT IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH WAS A NOTED THE PROVISION DID NOT CHANGE QUOTE THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO MAINTAIN A DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WILL PLACE. SECONDARILY THE BILL HAS ITS MECHANISM FOR CONTACT THE BILL PLACES THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS IN FEE HA WITH THE OFFICIAL USED TO PROTECT AGAINST PROTECTED CATEGORIES- YOU KNOW GRAYSKULL. SEXUAL. CALGEL THAT SEE THAT- BY THIS ISSUE IS THIS. SO FROM. BUT AGAIN TO BE CLEAR ARKANSAS ABOUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE USAGE SALIVA BASED THAT'S KIND OF NOT THE CORE ISSUE FOR US AS A RESULT AT THIS TIME WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED AB TWO ONE EIGHT AS A JOB KILLER BUT- ARE. HOPEFUL FOR FUTURE TALKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE HERE- IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COM YES PLEASE WELCOME PLACE YOUR FLOOR THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU DR COURT I AM CURIOUS- IF THIS BILL IS LIKE SUCH A- GOOD BILL AND FOR WORKERS AND THE PROGRESSION WHITE. WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS ON EXEMPTING THE TRADES THE BUILDING TRADES OUT OF THIS- LET ME JUST CHECK ON THAT. AFTER WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. ARE WE FELT THIS WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE BUILDING TRADES INDUSTRY AND THEIR EMPLOYERS AFTER THAT YOU SHOULD ASK THE CHAIR. BUT THAT WAS HIS THAT WAS HIS DECISION. AND WE AGREED. THE I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I YES- BURKE YOU GET. YEAH YOU GOT YOUR- THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL FEDERAL LAW THERE ARE SAY SENSE OF POSITION THAT WAY THAT LEAST IT I'D RATHER YOU KNOW OKAY. HOW THAT'S YOUR CHECK WITH THE CHAIR. WELL MISTER CHAIR I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN TO STEP INTO A HORNET'S. BUT- IT'S PARTNER THE BETTER DO I DO WANT TO SAY AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH A LOT AND INDUSTRIES AND THE EMPLOYEES- AND THIS IS BY NO MEANS AN ISSUE WITH MY RELATION WITH THE TRADE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT- I WOULDN'T I AM JUST CURIOUS LIKE WHY EXAM TO THE ROUGHLY FOUR FIFTY THOUSAND THREE MEMBERS YEAH THE- APPRECIATE IT IS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN GOING ON FOR. THIS IS A BILL OR LEGISLATION SOME OF THIS HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM NUMBER OF YEARS INCLUDING BY OUR CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB BONTA INTO SEVERAL COURT TOOK UP THE MANTLE BUT THE PERSON BEFORE AS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. VERY IN DEPTH THE- NEGOTIATION DEBATE CONVERSATION WITH THE TRADES- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THERE WERE EFFORTS TO TRY TO FIND THAT NEARLY CRAFTED EXEMPTIONS AGAIN BECAUSE THEY'VE- NEVER THE TRAYS AND HAVING. HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND- THINGS OF THAT NATURE- THAT IS WHERE. THE EXEMPTION FOUND OUT THEIR OTHER INDUSTRIES AND THEIR SON THAT CAME HERE IN OPPOSITION THAT WILL LIKE TO. WORK WITH THE AUTHOR- AND DO SO. IN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAKE ARGUMENTS FOR THOSE SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS- THAT'S THAT'S FINE BUT YOU KNOW THE- AND SO- ULTIMATELY- THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT OF BOTH WITH. LABOR COMMITTEE AND THE LABOR FEDERATION AND THE EMPLOYERS IN THE FIELD AND IN THE INDUSTRY ESSENTIALLY THE BUILDING TRADES AND THEIR EMPLOYERS THAT HIRE THEM THAT THEY BELIEVE THATALL THE TIME SHOULD BE TAKEN AND SO IT WAS IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF ONE EMPLOYER OR WORK OR YOU KNOW ONE TRADE WAS THE BUILDING TRADES WITH THE EMPLOYERS THAT THEY TRADITIONALLY WORK WITH THAT AN AGREEMENT AT ALL THE TEST SHOULD BE TAKEN SO. THIS IS NOT SET BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS OF CONVERSATION EFFORTS TO TRY TO FIND- I HAVE IN A POSITION THAT WORK FOR ALL SIDES AND WHAT THE CONCLUSION WAS WITH THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS THE- IS IN THOSE PARTICULAR IN THAT PARTICULAR ROLE IN THOSE PARTICULAR FEELS THEY PUT. DECIDED MUTUALLY. THAT ALL THE TESTS SHOULD BE APPLIED. I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST I DO WANT SAY THAT I WISH THAT AND I KNOW DOCTOR CORK I WISH THAT WE AS A LABOR COMMITTEE- IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE'S LABOR IS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMETIMES A WHICH WOULD GIVE THE SAME DEFERENCE. TO OUR OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL- WEATHERS THE CHAMBER THE FARMER WILL THEY ALL REPRESENT. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GROWERS- IN DIFFERENT BUSINESSES WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND IF WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT A POTATO MYSTERY AND CUT THEM OUT OF SOMETHING. I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS AND LOOK INTO OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES WITH IT. ON HOW THE IMPLEMENTED AS WELL TO DOCTOR QUIRK I WOULD JUST- AND PLEASE ENCOURAGE YOU HAS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO- IS THE CHAIR STATED TO. HAVE THESE OTHER OPPOSITION MEMBERS ENGAGE WITH THIS TO TRY TO WORK WITH THEM AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION THAT. IS NOT AS ROBUST AS IT MAY PUT THAT I'M SEEING RIGHT NOW SO I APPRECIATE YOU THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY LESS. WELL NEVER MIND. WHAT IF I COULD HAVE ONE LAST THING AND- CHIEF CONSULTANT IS. OUT IT'S A LITTLE MORE CONTACTS. THEY HAVE ANY CONTRACTS THAT HAVE THAT WOULD BE IMPAIRED WITH PROJECT OWNERS BECAUSE- THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT A CERTAIN PLAYERS. RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE PROJECTS AND THEY ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN CONTRACTS THAT DICTATE WHAT TESTING WILL BE WHAT HAVE YOU AND BECAUSE OF THAT. THIS BROAD BASED WILL WOULD ALSO IMPEDED THOSE CONTRACTS THEY HAVE CONTRACTS ON STANDARDS OF WHAT. C. TO BE REQUIRED IN A PARTICULAR SITE THAT MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT ANOTHER SIDE AS WELL. NO I ABSOLUTE RESPECT THAT I THINK THERE'S THOSE THOSE CONTRACTS GO FURTHER AND OUTSIDE OF THE LABOR REALM AS WELL AND I THINK WE NEED TO. BE MINDFUL OF THAT AS WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I DO. TO RELATE. I WANT TO ORDER ASSEMBLY REPORT FOR BRING THIS BILL FORD I THINK IT'S AN APT TO BUILD TO BRING BRING BE VOTING ON AND PASSING TODAY ON FOUR TWENTY. WHERE MANY FOLKS WILL BE ENJOYING LEGALIZED CANNABIS AND- YOU KNOW THAT IS THE NEW LAW OF THE LAND RIGHT AND WE SHOULD BE PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR THEIR- NEW LEGAL RIGHTS ENJOY RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. N. AS WELL. EVEN YOUR OPPOSITION- CONCEDED THAT THERE ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE MEASURES OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS IMPAIRED OR IN PEOPLE DOING JOBS. IT DOESN'T INVOLVE URINE TESTING SO I THINK ON THIS DAY WHEN THERE'S SO MANY ACROSS NOT JUST GOVERNMENT COUNTRY THEY'RE GOING TO BE CELEBRATING TODAY WITH. LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL CANNABIS RIGHT NOW. THAT THEY SHOULD NOT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB OR FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A JOB RIGHT NOW. AND ESPECIALLY WITH SOMETHING THAT LINGERS IN THE SYSTEM FOR SO LONG AND HAS NO REAL IMPETUS ON WHETHER NOT GET THE JOB SO. HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL PASS THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. THE WHAT ELSE. WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM THE SUMMER LEASE OR SECOND. THANK OKAY THE SECOND MISSILE- REYES. YEAH I'LL JUST SAY THAT LOOK YOU KNOW THAT THE TESTING. OF ANY SUBSTANCES. SO WE SHOULD NEVER BE REGULATED OR JUDGE OR AT LEAST WORKERS FROM THE REGULATOR JUDGE ON CONTACT WITH ARE NOT ON DUTY. IF SOMEONE HAS A FEW DRINKS I STARTED AT THE SHOP TO WORK ON A MONDAY- THAT'S NOT REALLY RELEVANT OR THAT AND FRANKLY THE BOSSES. IT IS OTHER BUSINESS- NOW THAT CANNABIS TO BE LEGALIZED WE HAVE THE DISTANCE WE HAD TO DE STIGMATIZE. CANNABIS USE- AND I KNOW IT'S A PROCESS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING USED TO THE IDEA. THAT WE HAVE TO DE STIGMATIZE WITH THE REALITY REALITY IS IT WAS STIGMATIZED BASEBALL A LOT OF PREJUDICE AND MISINFORMATION OVER SO MANY. DECADES AND REALLY GENERATIONS AND SO- I DO APPRECIATE. THE CONTINUED EFFORTS. OF ON THIS LEGISLATION WHICH I KNOW IS TAKEN ARDUOUS PATH BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE ON. A POSITIVE PATH FORWARD IS- EVEN HEARD FROM J. REPRESENTED THERE IS STILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR. A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO- WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT- ULTIMATELY IT REALLY IS ABOUT BRING EQUITY- IT HAS SPACE THAT. ALLOWS WORKERS TO BE FREE- FROM THE KIND OF THE MICROSCOPE OF THE EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY WITH THINGS THEY DO- OFF DUTY AND- THIS IS. IF THIS IS THE LAST APPEAR BEFORE US I WANT TO SAY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE HAVING YOU. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE- YOU ADDED SO MUCH TO THIS BODY INTO THIS COMMITTEE SPECIFICALLY WITH LEGISLATION BROUGHT FORWARD- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. DR QUICK HAPPY FOR TWENTY. I HAVE A FOUR TWENTY SHALL I CLOSE. YES YEAH SO. FIRST OF ALL WE DO NOT. WE DO NOT- PROHIBIT- PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTING YOU JUST HAVE TO USE THE SWAB NOT THE URINE TEST NOW MY SON WAS- HAD BEEN APPLICABLE AS ARE OFFERED A JOB WITH PG&amp;E WHICH ACCEPTED HE THEN HAD TO DO THE PRE EMPLOYMENT URINE TESTS AND HE SAID WELL THAT GONNA HAVE TO NOT SMOKE CANNABIS FOR A MONTH. AND THEN HE STARTED SMOKING TO GET TEST OF. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT A GOOD WAY. TO ENSURE SAFETY ON THE WORK PLACE IF YOU'RE GOING TO ENSURE SAFETY ON THE WORKPLACE YOU'VE GOT TO USE THAT ARE ALL SPOT. ONE TIME URINE TEST DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING- THE GAP WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THE LEGISLATION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. NOW WHAT THE CHAMBER DIDN'T SAY WHEN THEY SAID WE WANTED IN A DIFFERENT SECTION. WE HAVEN'T IN THE SECTION HERE BECAUSE IT IS EASIER TO ENFORCE THE LAW. OUR IF ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN BRING A COURSE OF ACTION. AND THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM AND BY PUTTING IT IN THE SECTION WE HAVE WE WILL ALLOW WORK TO REDRESS NOW IF THE CHAMBER WANTS TO WORK WITH US AND THIS IS REALLY WHY IT'S A JOB KILLER BY THE WAY AND IT'S OKAY WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS YOU CAN VOTE AGAINST IT KELLY IT'S TO IT'S FINE. I YOU KNOW I WAITED TEN YEARS TO DO A JOB KILLER BILL. NO IT THIS IS THE QUESTION QUESTION IN FOR. IF A PERSON FEELS THAT THEY- ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'VE USED CANNABIS OFF THE JOB HAVE ALWAYS COME. THEN WHAT IS THEIR BODIES THEIR REMEDY. IF WE CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO FIND OF MEMORY I THINK THE CHAMBER CAN GO AWAY. I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE ARE ALLOWING THAT PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTS- BELIEVE ME I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE AN EXEMPTION TO THE TRAITS BUT THEY SAID WE HAVE THESE CONTRACTS THERE BLAH BLAH BLAH. AND SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT IT BUT- I THINK THOSE CONTRACTS SHOULD CHANGE. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT GIVEN THE WAY THE CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A CHOICE. WE DON'T WANT. THERE IS SO MUCH WORRY WE ARE TRANSITIONING. TO A CARBON FREE ENVIRONMENT. AND PEOPLE IN THE TRADESPEOPLE IN THE STEEL WORKERS UNION TO WORK AT THE REFINERIES ARE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT THEIR JOBS AND IN FACT AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION THE HEAD OF THE TRADES. IS MIGHTILY COMPLAINING THAT WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR JOBS SO WE HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THEIR JOBS. IF I CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO CHANGE THINGS SO THAT THE TRADES CONFINED THE SIX. POSSIBLE AND THEY DON'T LOSE JOBS THEN I WILL ASK FOR THEM TO CHANGE IT'LL HAVE TO BE DONE BUT MY SUCCESSOR. SO AT THE MOMENT THERE JUST REALLY WASN'T ANY CHOICE. SO THANKYOU VERY MUCH DR CORK OF MADAM SECRETARY TO COULD TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHT.

THOSE ON THIS TOPIC. THIRTY WELL. ALL RIGHTS. FOR JERRY JONES SAWYER OF TO HELP ME OUT HERE ON ITEM EIGHTEEN IT'S- AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN ARGUMENT A- ITEM EIGHTEEN AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE KALRA. YOU MAY BE IN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU SO MUCH JERRY JONES SAWYER. I'M NOT SURE MEMBERS AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE WORKPLACE TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS BOTH CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE OF WORK AND ENSURING WORKERS ARE PROTECTED FROM UNDUE DISCRIMINATION. AND SURVEILLANCE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION I HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH BOTH INDUSTRY AND WORKER ADVOCATES ABOUT THE INCREASING USE OF DATA DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORKPLACE. OUR FINAL REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT POLICYMAKERS ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM THE HARMS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. MY DISTRICT IS LOOKING VALUE PACKS HOUSING WE CALL OURSELVES THE CAPITAL A SILICON VALLEY UNITS WHERE COMPANIES ARE CONSTANTLY RELEASING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DEPLOY IN THE WORKPLACE. TECHNOLOGIES LIKE SOFTWARE TO SELECT JOB APPLICANTS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS TO MONITOR THE PACE OF WORK AND APPS TO TRACK WORKERS LOCATIONS OR MOVEMENTS SOMETIMES WHETHER IT ON DUTY AND I DON'T WORKING. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE WHAT IS TO MUCH NEEDED YET REASONABLE% LIMITATIONS ON HOW EMPLOYERS USE DATA DRIVEN TECHNOLOGY AT WORK. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT BAN TECHNOLOGY EXCEPT FOR PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS DATA TOOLS LIKE FACIAL RECOGNITION. THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLICIES THAT RESTRICT THE SHARING OF CONSUMER INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES AND THIS BILL IS THAT AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN A WORKER AND AN EMPLOYER. THAT YOU HAVE AN APP THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT WORKS YOU USE YOUR DATA YOU KNOW THE IS THE UP. BUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BURGER THEIR EMPLOYER IS A VERY VERY DIFFERENT. WORKERS ENTERED PLAY EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP WITH LITTLE BARGAINING POWER. THEIR EMPLOYERS ARE COLLECTING MINING AND IN SOME CASES SHARING WORKERS DATA WITHOUT WORKERS HAVING ANY IDEA IT'S HAPPENING. TO WHAT EXTENT IT'S HAPPENING OR HOW THE EMPLOYER MAY BE USING IT TO MAKE EMPLOYMENT RELATED DECISIONS SUCH AS PROMOTION. FIRING OR IMPOSING DISCIPLINE. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE DOES THREE CRITICAL THINGS TO CREATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE USE OF WORKPLACE TECHNOLOGY. FIRST IT ENSURES THAT WORKERS ARE NOTIFIED PRIOR TO DATA COLLECTION USE OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND DEPLOYMENT OF ALGORITHMS. SECOND THE BILL REQUIRES THAT TECHNOLOGY BE USED FOR A VALID BUSINESS PRACTICE AND BE JOB RELATED. THIRD IT REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO CONDUCT IMPACT ASSESSMENTS WITH WORKER INPUT ON ALGORITHMS AND DATA COLLECTION TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL HARMS AND DISCRIMINATORY IMPACTS. THE TIME IS NOW TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING USE OF UNREGULATED DATA DRIVEN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WORKPLACE AND GIVE WORKERS AND THE STATE THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO MITIGATE ANY INSIDIOUS IMPACTS CAUSED BY THEM. WITH ME PROVIDE TESTIMONY IS SUPPORT OUR MID STEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND DOUG BLOCK WITH TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN. AND ON THE PHONE PROTECTING THOSE QUESTIONS IS ANNETTA BERNARD SPEAKING IN HER CAPACITY AS ONE OF THE AUTHORS THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER REPORT. DATA AND ALGORITHMS AT WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVE A FIVE MINUTES TWO MINUTES APIECE WHATEVER WAY YOU WANT TO DIVIDE IT UP. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. ALONG WITH THE SEIU STATE COUNCIL ON THE U. OF C. W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER LABOR GROUPS AND WORK PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS. WE REALLY BELIEVE THE SIZE AND BREADTH OF THAT COALITION REFLECTS THE- REACH AND SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM. THAT GOES FAR DEEPER AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THAN JUST AN INVASION OF WORKERS PRIVACY. AT ITS WORST THIS TECHNOLOGY REALLY DOES CONSTITUTE AN ATTACK ON VIRTUALLY ALL OF YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS A WORKER AND- WORSE YET IT'S OFTEN HIDDEN ONE. EXAMPLE OF AN APP WITH GEOLOCATION DATA WAS MENTIONED THAT'S A REALLY CRITICAL ONE FOR US BECAUSE THAT CAN BE USED TO TRACK A WORKER ON AND OFF THE JOB. WITH THE OBVIOUS A VERY GRAVE RISK TO YOUR RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF SAY ON EMPLOYER GIVING YOU A COMPANY PROVIDED LAPTOP THAT CAN CONDUCT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF YOU WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR HOME. VIDEOTAPING EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND YOU AND USING THAT DATA THAT'LL- THIS COLLECTED. FOR THE PURPOSES OF ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS. ELDORET NOW KNOWLEDGE HE HAS REALLY PER TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN BE USED TO DENY WORKERS AN INTERVIEW TO ADJUST YOUR SCHEDULE DR PAY DISCIPLINE AND FIRE YOU. AND NO ONE REALLY EVEN KNOWS HOW IT WORKS IT'S JUST OUT THERE AND SO WITH ALL OF THE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IS THE FACT THAT THE WORKERS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT IT'S HAPPENING. AND SO THEY DON'T. HAPPENING UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE THEY'RE VERY LITTLE RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO IT AND SO AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE IS REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE. IT HAS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED GIVES A WORKER NOTICED THAT IT'S BEING USED. GIVES A WORKER THE RIGHT TO ACCESS AND CORRECT THE DATA WHERE WHERE THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THEN ALSO STOP SOME OF THE WORST ABUSES. LIKE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF ITS WELL DOCUMENTED RACIALLY DISPARATE IMPACT AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY TRACKING WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE NOT AT WORK. BUT REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT THE BILL REALLY DOESN'T BAN VERY MUCH. THAT IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS THE EMPLOYER CAN USE ALL OF THIS BUDGET WHEREVER IT MAKES SENSE WHEREVER IT'S RELATED TO THE TASK AT HAND. AND IN DOING SO WE THINK IT REALLY DOES FINALLY ALIGN. OUR STATUS IN CALIFORNIA AS A CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION BUT ALSO PLACE THAT REALLY RESPECTS WORKERS RIGHTS. AND REALLY BRINGS THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS BOTH. IN A- SPECIAL TO EVERYONE INVOLVED SO WE URGE OUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I HAVE THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING THE TEAMSTERS UNION TODAY JUST AS I DID WHEN I SERVED ON THE GOVERNOR'S FUTURE WORK COMMISSION WITH MISTER KALRA. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT UNITED PARCEL SERVICE THE LARGEST UNIONIZED EMPLOYER IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TEAMSTERS. NOW I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SMART PHONES IN YOUR CAR'S SENSORS ON THE TRUCKS AND A NAVIGATION SYSTEM HERE'S THE DATA THE UPS COLLECTS ON US EVERY DAY. OUR VEHICLE SPEED LOCATION HOW HARD WE HIT THE BRAKES. IDOLING TIME FUEL CONSUMPTION WHETHER WE HAVE OUR SEAT BELTS ON THE HOURS WE WORK AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO MAKE DELIVERIES. THE SYSTEM EVEN TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE ANY LEFT TURNS ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE THAT TAKES MORE TIME AND USES MORE GAS. ROCKING ALL OF THIS IS CALLED TELEMATICS AND USED RIGHT IT ACTUALLY MAKES OUR JOBS EASIER AND MORE EFFICIENT. BUT THERE'S A DARK SIDE TO. TELEMATICS WORKS VERY WELL FOR U. P. S. IT HAD ITS MOST PROFITABLE YEAR EVER AND THANKS TO US THEY SHARE THOSE PROFITS WITH OUR MEMBERS. THE UNION CONTRACT EVEN SAYS NO DRIVER CAN GET FIRED BECAUSE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY THE HUMAN SUPERVISOR HAS TO OBSERVE YOUR BEHAVIOR NOT THE ALGORITHM. THIS ISN'T TRUE FOR AMAZON DRIVERS WHO GET FIRED WITH NO RECOURSE OR GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE. THEY DO THE SAME WORK THAT WE DO AND ALL WORKERS SHOULD HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS NOT JUST UNION WORKERS. IN ERROR WITH AN ALGORITHM MAY NOT BE A BIG DEAL FOR A CORPORATION BUT FOR A WORKER CAN BE CATASTROPHIC IT COULD MEAN LOSING YOUR JOB GETTING INJURED OR EVEN DEATH. OUR GOVERNMENT RULES AND REGULATIONS NEED TO CATCH THE TECHNOLOGY AND AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO GIVING WORKERS THE PROTECTIONS THEY NEED. IF YOU PS CAN. AND USE ALL THIS OLOGY SO CAN ANY CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER I'LL BE HAPPY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU KNOW GO TO THE ROOM UNDER ANY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM AND SUPPORT. OF AB SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE KALRA YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION.

YOU CAN DO ALL THE FIVE MINUTES APIECE JUST YOU BUDGET. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPOSITION. I MEAN BEFORE ADDRESSING THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL I DO JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT PROCESS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT GOTTEN AMENDS ARE VERY COMMON LEGISLATIVE PROCESS ABSOLUTELY BUT- OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE SPONSORS ABOUT THE ISSUE PRIVACY EMPLOYER RIGHTS FOR MONTHS WE REACHED OUT IN THE FALL- BECAUSE OF ISSUES RELATED TO PROVISIONS OF THE CPRE THAT ARE GOING TO EXPIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHEN THEY TOLD US THAT THEY WERE EXPLORING A BILL DEALING WITH POTENTIALLY TRACKING EMPLOYEREMPLOYEES OUTSIDE OF WORKING HOURS IN EDS WE COMMITTED YOU KNOW TO TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT THEY TOLD US REPEATEDLY THAT WE WOULD SEE LANGUAGE- WITHIN WEEKS- IT. IN FROM ONE WEEK TO TWO WEEKS- AND SO WE WERE QUITE FRANKLY SHOCKED ON MONDAY WHEN I WENT TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS POSTED AND I FOUND A THIRTY THREE PAGE BILL- THAT WE HAD NEVER BEEN INFORMED OF AND WE HAD NEVER BEEN SET IN ADVANCE- AND SO AGAIN IT WAS JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR US TO HAVE TO WALK IN. TRYING TO SCRAMBLE TO GET FEEDBACK ON THIS- WITHIN LESS THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS I'M IN ALSO THE DAY BEFORE THE OTHER COMMITTEE THAT IS NOW WE'RE FOR THIS BILL IS NOW BEEN REFERRED TO WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT TO HAVE ITS LAST HEARING IS NOW GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL HEARING NEXT WEEK- SO NEEDLESS TO SAY WE ARE. FOR QUITE DISAPPOINTED I THINK WITH THE PROCESS OF HOW- THIS BILL WENT TO PRINCE- AND WE REALLY DO NOT CONDONE THAT BEHAVIOR. I'M SO JUST TURNING BRIEFLY TO SUBSTANCE- ARE MEMBERS OF COURSE GIVEN TO BE GOTTEN AMANDA THIRTY THREE PAGES ON MONDAY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FULLY DIGEST THE BILL. BUT ON OUR END YOU ARE SORRY REVIEW THE BILL WE DO INTEND TO GET A JOB KILLER- QUITE FRANKLY THE BILL. WHILE THERE. A LOT IN HIS YOU KNOW OF WHAT SPONSORS. SAID WE ARE AB. COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS BILL GOES FAR BEYOND THAT'S- SO FOR EXAMPLE IS BASICALLY AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE OR DOCUMENT THAT AN EMPLOYEE EVER PRODUCES TO SEE IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO STORE IT. I MEAN YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY SORT OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE CORROBORATED SO IF LIKE- ONE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WAS MENTIONED RIGHT SHOWS THAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING LIKE NINETY MILES PER HOUR SOMETHING IN A SCHOOL ZONE. THAT'S NOT COOPERATED IF THERE'S NOT SOMEONE ELSE THERE WITH YOU. AN EMPLOYER CAN MAKE NO DISCIPLINARY ACT. THAT I ALSO WILL REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL HR INVESTIGATION PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS AND- OSHA IN D. I. R. WOULD HAVE TO. ACTIVELY APPROVED EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT AN EMPLOYEE USES GIVEN THE BREADTH OF THE DEFINITION. SO AGAIN WHILE WE APPRECIATE WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO HERE WE REALLY JUST. HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THIS BILL WE DON'T THINK IT'S WORKABLE AT ALL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR PENALTIES I'M GOING UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. FACTORED BILL APPLIES BUSINESS IN. ALL SIZES NOT JUST BIG BUSINESSES SMALL AS WELL- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- BUT NOW GO TO THE ROOM. HIS WITHIN THE- HEARING.

OPERATOR WILL NOW BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD THANK YOU I WANT TO- THINK THAT CHAIR ARE CALLING FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL I THINK IT'S TIME TO SEND YOU KNOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT- LEADER OUR THAT YOU KNOW. YOU WANT TO GET THIS INFORMATION RIGHT THE WORLD IS CHANGING FAST THERE IS A LOT OF IMPORTANT- IMPROVEMENTS TO BE DONE IN THIS SPACE- IF WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT AT A MINIMUM WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR EMPLOYEES- TO SO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW INFORMATION MIGHT BE- MONITOR TRACKED- YOU KNOW BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE WORKPLACE. THERE IS JUST A LOT BECAUSE OF ALL THE OP- SOCKS SOMETIMES WHEN I HEAR ABOUT HOW ANALYTICS COULD BE- YOU KNOW TRACKING ME AS A CONSUMER- AND CERTAINLY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE- I HAVE SOME SENSE OF DIGNITY AND A SENSE OF- TO THE RIGHT AGREE PRIVACY- IN GOING ABOUT ON THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND THEY THEY PROBABLY DO. I'M SO I DO WANT TO SEE THIS ABSOLUTELY MOVE FORWARD I KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO- REALLY DIGEST HERE WORK THROUGH MANY COMMITTEES HOPEFULLY LIE AHEAD THAT WILL REALLY GET INTO SO MANY OF THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES- BUT I DO WONDER YOU KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE OFTEN HOW WE TALK ABOUT EMPLOYEE MISS CLASSIFICATION- AND HOW- WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE- IN IN IN THAT SORT OF EVOLUTION AS WELL- WITH REGARD TO THE- BILL. HOW IT MIGHT APPLY TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR OTHER WAYS THAT NOT PLEASE NOT LABELED- AND WHAT IS OUR ABILITIES TO THEM TO OTHER- WORKERS- IN IN IN. ANY INDUSTRY. SURE THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY BEING AFFORDED PROTECTIONS AND THEIR PRIVACY AND. AND TRACKING YOUR INFORMATION. IT I COULD JUST CHECK OUT. MR BLOCK HAS IN COMMON ON THAT. SURE YES YOU WITH A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO AMAZON IS AN EXAMPLE. STARTING AGAIN WITH UPS WHERE SOMEBODY WITH A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CAN MAKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR DRIVING FOR UPS. FULLY PAID FAMILY HEALTH INSURANCE AND A PENSION. DELIVERING PRIMARILY AMAZON PACKAGES WHERE UPS DRIVER MAKES ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WITH NO PENSION- OR I'M AN AMAZON DRIVER I'M SORRY SO. ON THE ISSUE OF MIS CLASSIFICATION AND SUBCONTRACTING THIS IS THIS IS THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM THERE THESE UPS TRUCKS OR AT AMAZON TRUCKS WEARING AMAZON UNIFORMS. THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WORK FOR AMAZON THEY WORK FOR SUBCONTRACTORS OF THE COMPANY- ALTHOUGH IT'S AMAZON'S TELEMATICS SYSTEMS THAT SURVEIL THE WORKERS AND CAUSE THEM TO BE DISCIPLINED. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE AMAZON FLEX DRIVERS WHO ARE PEOPLE DELIVERING PACKAGES IN THEIR OWN CARS THEY ARE MISCLASSIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES REALLY. AND THEY ARE LIKE UBER FOR PACKAGE DELIVERY IN THE TELEMATICS IN THAT CASE ACTUALLY SET THEIR WAGES. SO THESE ARE THE STORIES OF THE TELEMATICS SO THE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT'S DYNAMIC PRICING IT'S BASED THIS IS HOW UBER WORKS TO BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND AT THAT EXACT MOMENT IN TIME THAT SETS YOUR COMPENSATION FUTURE OF WORK FOR ALL OF US THE IN MY OPINION FROM OUR TIME ON THE FUTURE WORK COMMISSION THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE IS NOT THE ROBOTS COMING TO TAKE OUR JOBS IT'S THE ROBOTS COMING TO SUPERVISE US. AND THAT'S WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR THE PIZZA WITH THE BILL. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. I THOUGHT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRING FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND OFFER ALL THE SPONSORS WORK ON THIS AND HAVE CONFIDENCE OF THE MANY COMMITTEE HEARINGS FOR YOU IRON OUT THE DETAILS OF THESE THINGS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA BEING A LARGE ECONOMIES WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY TO FOLLOW OUR EUROPEAN PEERS AND TO PROTECT DATA JUST AS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE COLLECTION APPLICATION OF DATA WHEN IT COMES TO BIG GOVERNMENTS OR ITS STATE SPONSORED ENTITIES WE ALSO MUST BE ON THE GUARD ABOUT BIG CORPORATIONS AS WELL WHICH RUN UNFETTERED. AND DUG YOUR POINT ABOUT ROBOTS BECOMING A SUPERVISOR SAID MOSTLY BECOMING THAT WORKFORCE THAT IS ALSO TRUE I MEAN ANY PERSON THAT THEY COULD SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY ALREADY HAS A MANAGER AS A PERSON THAT PERSONAL CURATOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA BE AN ALGORITHM. AND THAT IS BECAUSE BE THAT APPLICATION THROUGHOUT THE SENSE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BILLS LIKE THIS THAT NOT ONLY REINFORCE THE CONSENT OF A WORKER RIGHT THAT KNOWING WHAT IS BEING SHARED HOW TO APPLY. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG AND INNATELY WITH BIG DATA L. ANOTHER OUT DATA ANALYSTS IN GENERAL YOU KNOW THE SET OF THE CHAIR AND I'LL COME FROM THE CAPITAL OF SILICON VALLEY AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF UNTAPPED- POTENTIAL AN APPLICATION THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW OF BUT IT'S VERY VERY MICHAEL AND HE CAN EXTRACT SO MUCH FROM CONSUMERS AND WORKERS THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE POINT OF BUILDING THESE GUARDRAILS SENSE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. AND. YEAH SECOND ALREADY. OKAY ANYONE ELSE BUT AND NOT WHAT THANK YOU THE THIS THIS ISSUE- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN WHEN HE WILL RETIRE ALGORITHMS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO- HIRING PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY MAKING SURE YOU DON'T- USING ALGORITHMS TO TAKE OUT THE RACIAL PREJUDICE IN THE HIRING PROCESS THAT I RAN INTO A LOT OF PROBLEMS. WITH WITH THAT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AT WE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THIS WHERE SHE GO THROUGH EACH OF THE PARAMETERS THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU COULD PROGRAM THIS TO YOU COULD ACTUALLY- SEGREGATE OUT PEOPLE YOU DON'T WANT. IF IT'S PROGRAM IN INAPPROPRIATELY. AND WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT ANYONE WOULD DO THAT BUT I'D SAY NEED TO LEARN. THAT THIS WORLD IS A- AS BAD AS THEY THINK IT IS ALL THE TIME. AND THEN WHEN IT CAME TO A FACIAL RECOGNITION WHICH I'M UP. I WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF. UNTIL ONE DAY THEY DID THE FACIAL RECOGNITION AND SHOWED EVERYONE THAT HAD A FELONY. CONVICTION ON THE LAWN AND ONE OF THOSE PLACES WITH MINE. AND I DON'T HAVE A FELONY CONVICTION. AND THEY HAD OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SO AGAIN WHAT EVER PROGRAMMING THAT WAS DONE BY HUMANS- RESULTED IN- IN ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT. IN THIS CASE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS TO COULD YOU COULD BE VERY DEVASTATING TO AN EMPLOYEE. AND SO WE NEED TO I STILL BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO USED THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I BELIEVE BUSINESSES NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE IT. BUT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF STABILITY AND ABILITY TO ENSURE ACCURACY. IS THE PER MONTH BEING THAT WE DO WHEN WE USE ANY OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE I THE BILL. AND SO- DEFINITELY GOING TO MOVE THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY ROBUST CONVERSATION. WITHOUT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE CHAMBER AND YOU NEED TO KIND OF SAY WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO. MMHM HOW ARE WE TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER NOT ONLY FOR EMPLOYEES BUT DEPLOYER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. MAKING SURE THE DEUCE INTEGRITY. IN WHAT EVER WE DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO DO AND I'M SO GLAD WE'RE- WORK WERE NOW BEGINNING THIS CONVERSATION I MEAN I WAS ONLY HAD A LITTLE PIECE OF IT. BUT I TO REALIZE HOW ROBUST. TECHNOLOGY CAN BE RIGHT NOW IN THE EMPLOYMENT SECTOR AND I'M GLAD WE'RE BEGINNING THIS DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW AND I KNOW IT'S HARD. BUT LIKE LIKE LOVE THE CHAMBER SAID IS WHAT THIRTY THREE PAGES. OF THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT. IT SO- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YOU MAY CLOSE WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRPERSON PAUL FOR YOU BEING WILL TAKE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND I RECALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS DISTINCTLY LOOK IT WAS AS HONEST AND WELL INTENTIONED QUESTIONS YOU THIS BY WOULD BE NECESSARY BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE USING THESE KINDS OF ANALYTICS FOR MAKING SUCH CRITICAL DECISIONS IN ONE'S- EMPLOYMENT OF THE WORKERS DO A PRICE AND IT IS DOABLE AS WE HEARD FROM MR BLOCK. OF UPS DOES IT AND THEY DO IT IN WITH LABOR CONTRACTS EVERYONE AGREES THAT THERE'S CERTAIN DATA THAT IS NECESSARY FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY- THAT HELPS EVERYONE INVOLVED HELPS THEM BECOME PROFITABLE MORE PROFITABLE AND SO I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO HAVE A WELL INTENTIONED AND REASONED AND A CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAMBER OR ANYONE ELSE IF THEIR GOAL IS TO HAVE AN ENDPOINT. THAT ACTUALLY HELPS US THE CITY THAT THE GOAL IS JUST TO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T WATCH THE TV SHOW SEVERANCE LATELY. I THINK WHEN MOST OF US WATCH IT. WE SEE SOME DYSTOPIAN WORKPLACE HELP PLACE TO THE FUTURE HELLSCAPE OF THE FUTURE. SOMETIMES A PIECE OF THE CHAMBER OF THAT THAT'S OUR TEN YEAR PLAN. AND WE CAN'T HELP THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSE. THAT WORKERS HAVE RIGHTS THEY HAVE SELF DETERMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T RULES WE ALL ABIDE BY RULES IN OUR WORKPLACE. AND MANY TIMES THOSE RULES CAN CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCY. BUT THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT WE NEED TO REALLY. DIVE DEEP INTO THIS TO DIG DEEP. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS NOT DELAYS ARE NOT JUST WAYS OF CALLING EVERYTHING A JOB OR THE YOU DON'T LIKE. BUT ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE TABLE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. MY TABLE IS ALWAYS OPEN TO THEM. WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY US FROM LABOR. WITH THAT WE HAVE A PROMOTION IN THE SECOND MATCH SECRETARY WILL CALL THE ROLL. I BELIEVE THE CHAIR IS AN AYE VOTE I COULD BE WRONG BUT I BELIEVE THE- MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. KALRA HI KALRA HI FLORA FLORA NO JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER I REYES. REYES SIZE ZERO ZERO TO KNOW WARD. WORD I'D LEAVE HI LEE I BELIEVE THAT BILL IS AT. ON TO PRIVACY CORRECT. A PASSED THE GAVEL AUTHORITY BACK TO THE CHAIR MISTER KALRA. IT'S LIKE HOLDING ON. ALL RIGHT SO UP NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO WITH ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB. TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN. EVERY YEAR READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN A BILL THAT WOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF DATA AT THE PORT DRAYAGE IN THE PARTRIDGE- INDUSTRY AMID COVERT NINETEEN WE HAVE SEEN SUPPLY CHAIN DELAYS THAT HIGHLIGHT THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN. EFFICIENT GOODS MOVEMENT OUR NATION'S PORTS AND WHILE COVE IT WAS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SHUTDOWNS AROUND THE WORLD WIDESPREAD MIS CLASSIFICATION OF TRUCK DRIVERS CONTRIBUTED TO A SHORTAGE OF DRIVERS AND LESS EFFICIENT PORT OPERATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS. WE COULDN'T GET THE FURNITURE SWING SPACE ON TIME BECAUSE IT WAS DELAYED AT THE PORTS. THE PORTS ARE OUR GATEWAY TO THE WORLD IN A CRITICAL AND CRITICAL TO THE FLOW OF GOODS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WILL INVEST BILLIONS ON MODERNIZING PORTS AND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED INCREASE TRANSPARENCY INTO ACTION TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND IDENTIFY BOTTLENECKS MEMBERS SUPPORT OF LOS ANGELES HAS RANKED AS THE NUMBER ONE CONTAINER PORT IN THE UNITED STATES H. EACH YEAR SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. THIS TRANSLATES TO MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRUCKS MOVING FROM THE PORT OF LA THE PORT. ALL THROUGHOUT L. A. COUNTY TO THE INLAND EMPIRE WAREHOUSES AND ALONG THE WAY THEY PASSED MY DISTRICT. WHICH INCLUDE THE TO THE FIVE THE TEN THE SIXTY THE ONE NO ONE THE ONE TEN THE ONE THIRTY FOUR. AND THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAYS. LABOUR IN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR DECADES TO RAISE STANDARDS AT THE PORTS FROM REDUCING EMISSIONS TO CRACKING DOWN ON MISS CLASSIFICATION AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THAT. WOULD REQUIRE THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY TO COLLECT AND CONSOLIDATE SPECIFIED DATA RELATED TO GOOD MOVEMENT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SUPPLY CHAIN AND WOULD REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO MAKE THIS THAT AT THE STATE OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. ON ITS WEBSITE THIS WORK HAS RESULTED IN A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP OF LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES. UNITED TO PUSH FOR CLEAN AND SAFE PORTS. IN A VARIETY OF EFFORTS TO HELP IT THESE CONCERNS HOWEVER THE WORK IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE DATA ON THE PORT DRAYAGE INDUSTRY IS SPREAD ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES. AND NON MULTIPLE DATABASES THIS BILL TEMPS TO FILL IN SOME OF THOSE GAPS AND CREATE A MUCH NEEDED STANDARD OF DATA COLLECTION THAT CAN BE ASILY ACCESSED. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION OVER THEIR CONCERNS AND THEY HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO FIND A REASONABLE PATH FORWARD TODAY HERE TESTIFIED. BLOCKS WITH THE TEAMS FOR THE- IN ORDER GONZALEZ WITH THE BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THERE ARE BLOCKS TEACHERS SUPPORT DIVISION ALSO LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR- AND WE ARE PROUD COOKS CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL- ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT BEFORE THE CURRENT SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF PORT TRUCK DRIVERS CREATED CONGESTIONS AND DELAYS AND CREATED A PERFECT STORM THAT ENABLED THE CURRENT CRISIS HAPPENS. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PORT TRUCK DRIVERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED IS THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL THEIR RATES THEY DON'T CONTROL THEIR HOURS THEY DON'T CONTROL. ANYTHING THEY BASICALLY ARE HAVE KIND OF STANDARD MINIMUM WAGES AND THEY HAVE TO BEAR THE ENTIRE COST OF BUYING THEIR TRUCK MAINTAINING THEIR TRUCK AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET ENOUGH JOBS TO GET BY. WHICH MEANS THEY'RE NOT PAID BY THE HOUR SO THEY COULD SIT FOR TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX HOURS IDOLING WAITING FOR CARGO TO COME IT. THERE'S ALSO NO REAL ABILITY TO TRACK AND CONTROL AND HAVE AN EFFICIENT WORKFORCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE FLEET YOU CAN DEPLOY A TRUCK DRIVERS SO YOU CAN HAVE. TWENTY FOUR HOUR SEVEN DAY A WEEK OPERATIONS AT THE PORT. RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T AND SO. THE NARRATIVE IN THE PRESS AND EVEN IN THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY TALKING ABOUT ALMOND GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS- AT PORT TRUCK DRIVERS. YOU DON'T HAVE A SHORTAGE WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF GOOD DIRECT EMPLOYMENT JOBS AT THE PORT THAT ENABLE THE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF CARGO. THE OTHER THING IS THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH- CLEAN VEHICLES WITH THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN VEHICLES MUCH LOWER AMONG THIS CLASSIFIED TRUCK DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY SIMPLY CAN'T AND SO THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING PORTS AND SO NOW WE HAVE THIS CLASS. IMPACTING TRUCK DRIVERS THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE PORTS AND OUR BROADER ECONOMY. AND SO WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS THAT THE BITE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THE OCEAN LINERS TO THE POOR EXT OUT TO THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE WELL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SEAS WE CAN'T CONTROL INTERSTATE COMMERCE. BUT WE CAN HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AT THE PORTS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE HELLO AND SO THIS BILL REALLY IS SAYING OKAY LET'S LOOK AT OUR PORTS LET'S COLLECT ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS OUT THERE. AND IDENTIFY SOME OF THE GAPS LET'S LOOK AT WHO IS EIGHT EMPLOYEE TRUCK DRIVER IN WHO IS MISCLASSIFIED AND PUT THAT IN ONE PLACE SO THAT WE CAN START TO MOVE TOWARDS THAT TRANSPARENCY. HOPE THAT WE CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIS CLASSIFICATION AT THE PORT. ALSO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE EFFICIENT GOODS MOVEMENTS AND CREATE BETTER JOBS BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT A SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS BUT IT'S A SHORTAGE OF GOOD JOBS THAT WE NEED TO START KNOWING. ARE WE STARTING TO MEET OUR GOALS ARE WE SEEING THAT WHEN WE HAVE EMPLOYEE DRIVERS THERE'S MORE EFFICIENCY- AND GET TO THAT POINT TO REALLY THIS IS LAYING THE FOUNDATION SO THAT POLICYMAKERS RESEARCHERS THE PORT DIRECTORS. HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE TO START MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT- OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SO FOR THOSE REASONS I- DRIVER. THANK YOU MEMBERS OR THROUGH AND SALAS ON BEHALF OF THE BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE A PARTNERSHIP OF STATE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOWARDS THE COMMON GOAL. OF ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WHILE MAINTAINING A GOOD PAYING JOBS AND INEQUITABLE ECONOMY. I TOOK A REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTING SECTORS IN THE STATE AND- PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOITIVE OF ITS WORKFORCE. BUT TO ITS CREDIT THIS LEGISLATOR HAS PASSED THE NUMBER OF BILLS TO CLEAN UP THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. AND REDUCE THE INSIDIOUS PRACTICE OF MIS CLASSIFICATION THOSE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED AB SEVEN NINE FOUR AB FIVE AND SB THREE THREE EIGHT. BUT DESPITE YOUR BEST EFFORTS MISS CLASSIFICATION REMAINS A PERVASIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE WITHIN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY- AND THAT ARE NOT ONLY EXPLOITS WORKERS BUT ALSO IMPERILS OUR STATES- CLEAN TRUCKING- GOALS. ARE BECAUSE COMPANIES OFFLOAD THEIR OPERATIONAL COSTS ONTO WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED CONTRACTORS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH- THE STATE'S CLEANER GOAL- AND THIS REALLY PUTS A- HAMPER OWNERS THE- ABILITY TO REALLY REACH THOSE TARGETS. AB. TWENTY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE TRUCKING OPERATIONS WORK- AND CARD DATA BEARS THIS OUT AS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A FULL PICTURE OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IN THEIR CURRENT ROLE MAKING. RBG ITSELF HAS A PUT OUT A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY SUBMITTED A NUMBER OF- REQUEST FOR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION I CAN ATTEST TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THOSE EXISTING DATA SETS. PLEASE CONTINUE THIS LEGISLATORS- RECORD OF PROTECTING EMPLOYEES AND VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS SIZE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERYMUCH. ANYONE IN THE ROOM. FAVOR AB. TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN. MR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND SPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBER STEVEN MYERS ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ACTION FUND IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL AND WESTERN STATES CONSERVE SHEET METAL WORKERS WHO MAKE UP THE LABOR PORTION OF THE BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET A MODERATOR ANYONE ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WISH TO SUPPORT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO NOW AGAIN IN LONDON ZERO IF YOU WISH TO SUPPORT. AND WE NEED TO HAVE ABOUT THREE IN THE QUEUE LOCAL TO LINE A ONE OH TO PLEASE WELL I HAD. THIS IS A MONTH. CALIFORNIA SO VOTERS IN FORT. THANK YOU. BUT COMPACT. BACK TO THE HOTEL I THANK TWO PLEASE I HAD. NINE SEVENTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI MICHAEL- WITH THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR NEW ECONOMY AND ALSO WITH THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER AND WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ENACT THE MULTI LINE A ONE OH ONE PEOPLE HAD. HELLO MY NAME IS GETTING BEYOND LOCUSTS RADIUS BOARD MEMBER WITH LATINOS IN ACTION CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE PROBABLY SUPPORT AB. TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THAT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE OPPOSITION AND SO THE PROPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO COME ON UP TO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO FROM PATHFINDER AT MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE CHRISTIAN MODE OF THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN BUT WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR REACHING OUT IN VANCE OF THE HEARING LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MISSUS OF BUILDING SORT OF THE PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN PHONE LINES. THEY WENT OPPOSITION AB TWENTY SEVEN. YES THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE PRESS ONE MIN ZERO NOW AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU. CORRECT OVER THE BACK- TO THE COMMITTEE MEASURE THE RESEARCHER I DO JUST- YOU SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT A SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS- YEAH THERE'S A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE THE STATE'S THE AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATION THERE'S ACTUALLY SORT OF LIKE EIGHTY THOUSAND. TRUCK DRIVERS AND SO WHEN THE ONLINE IS THE ONLY HISTORY SAYS THIS WE DEAL WITH THIS ON A DAILY BASIS I AM CURIOUS LIKE. IF THERE'S A ROUGHLY SHORT OF EIGHTY THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS BASED ON THAT STUDY- HOW CAN WE SAY THAT THERE'S NO SHORTAGE AND WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO TO. ALLOW THE BECAUSE I MEAN WE'VE ALL DEALT WITH AB FIVE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND I THINK THIS BILL IS- IS SIMPLY ANOTHER. QUITE FRANKLY SHOT OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY- TO GET IT UNDER HER ARM A LABOR AGREEMENT. AND WHETHER WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THAT- IS NOT WHAT I'M ORDER. AND ALLOW MY CONCERN TODAY RIGHT NOW. BUT I DO THINK. WITH EIGHTY THOUSAND. VACANCIES ANYTHING THAT WE DO TO. REDUCE THAT IS GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC. EVEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CLEAN VEHICLES. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A VEHICLE OUT THERE IT'S CLEAN. SO WHEN WE MOVED THROUGH THESE POLICIES I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS. AT A VERY HONEST ABOUT THIS AND HAVE TO SLOW THIS THING DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY JUST NOT REALLY A- QUESTION I GUESS. IS MORE JUST OF A STATEMENT LIKE I JUST I HAD TO PUSH BACK I'M SORRY JUST EVER SO GENTLY ON THAT WE DO HAVE A- A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF TRUCK DRIVERS IN THE COUNTRY. WHO ELSE. COMMON QUESTIONS I BELIEVE WE NEED A MOTION ON THOSE AS WELL. SIR MOTION THANK THE- ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEASE SECONDED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES AND THIS IS A BILL THAT I ALSO. I SAW IN TRANSPORTATION AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I DO BELIEVE THAT WE DO NEED TO DO THAT CAN. SEARCH INCREASED NUMBER OF TRUCKERS BUT THEN THERE'S SOME LIMIT TO THAT AND I THINK LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR- MOVE IN OVER THE LINE- THERE IS AS WELL AS A- NOBODY CAN. OF THE PORTS ARE CRITICAL BOTH IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF WORK ON BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH WITH WORKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS EVERYBODY ON BOARD AND SO WITH THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL- HE IS A MEMBER COMMUNITIES LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU- WELL I FIRST LET ME JUST SAY- I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ON A ON THE- WHAT APPEARS TO BE- A LACK OR- SHORTAGE. OF TRUCK DRIVERS WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE THAT INDEPENDENCE MISCLASSIFIED TRUCK DRIVERS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO. ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THE STATE IS PUTTING FORWARD TO CREATE CLEAN ENERGY VEHICLES THAT MOVE ACROSS THE STATE THE MOVE FROM THE PORTS THAT GO ALL THE WAY TO THE WAREHOUSES. UNFORTUNATELY MISS CLASSIFICATION OFTEN LEADS TO THE FACT THAT AN INDEPENDENT TRUCK DRIVERS DON'T GET ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES. SO WHILE WE HAVE. CREATED INCREDIBLE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS THAT HAVE LED THE NATION IN OUR LEADING THE WORLD QUITE QUITE FRANKLY. WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE WORK FORCE- AND THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE WORKING FAMILIES THAT ACTUALLY. MOVE THESE GOODS ACROSS OUR STATE HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS- WE HAVE LABOR WE HAVE BUSINESS WE HAVE A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS RIGHT. IT IS WHY I HAVE ACTIVELY REACHED OUT TO OPPOSITION TO SAY WE NEED YOU AT THE TABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS RIGHT AND THAT YOU ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONVERSATION. I FEEL LIKE THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE HAVE HAD. A WITH THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT BILLS THAT WE HAVE DONE AROUND THE SECTOR. IS PROVING THAT THERE IS A WAY TO HAVE BOTH THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE- LABOR STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING. ADHERED TO. THAT WORKERS TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT WE AND THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF A WORK FORCE THAT DOES NOT RECEIVE SEVERAL BENEFITS. THAT ARE ENTITLED TO THEM AS CURSING AND THAT ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA IS SETTING. THE TRUE PATHWAY FOR CALIFORNIA GREEN NEW DEAL THAT ACTUALLY INCLUDES CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE JUSTICE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT JUST TRANSITION AND SETS THE TONE NOT ONLY FOR OUR STATE. BUT FOR THE NATION ACTUALLY MAKE THAT A REALITY AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE CALL THE ROLL ON AB TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN PLEASE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA HI KALRA AYE FLORA FLORA NUMBER JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER I REYES. REYES EYES ZERO ZERO KNOWN WARD WE CAN MOVE ON TO ITEM TWELVE ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AB. TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PROUD 2% ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE FOR SOLAR PROJECTS OVER FIFTEEN KILOWATTS THAT OPT INTO THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM IN WOULD REQUIRE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON ROOFTOP SOLAR ADOPTION BY. SISTER AND ZIP CODE THAT'S THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS THE LEAD ENTITY TO REGULATE UTILITIES AND ACT ON BEHALF OF RATE PAYERS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND THEY'VE USE THAT MANDATE TO CREATE GENEROUS INCENTIVES FOR ROUTE. FOURNETTE HAS LED. WHAT THEY WHEN STATE AUTHORITY IS BEING USED TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE THAT BENEFIT SOME OF THE COST OTHERS IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AND MAKE SURE THAT A PUBLIC BENEFIT IS BEING DERIVED MEMBERS LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT MAKING CHANGES TO THE TERROR OF OFFERED BY NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM RATHER THIS BILL IS TWO THINGS THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS SEE A RETURN. ON AN INCENTIVE CREATED ON BEHALF IT IS A REALITY THAT SOLAR INSTALLERS ARE NOT PAID AS MUCH AS OTHER ELECTRICAL FIRST. THERE ARE AN EXAMPLES FROM THE LAST DECADE OF LARGE COMPANIES THAT HAVE USE INNOVATION AS AN EXCUSE TO DRIVE DOWN WAGES. FROM RIDE SHARE TO WORK HOUSE WORK THIS COMMITTEE HAS SEEN IT ALL. WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS IN A GLEAM IN A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A WORLD LEADER IN A CLEAN GREEN ENERGY. INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD NOT ONLY INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO ON THE PLANNING NECESSARY TO GET 21100% RENEWABLE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THAT BILL SB ONE HUNDRED WHICH I CO AUTHORED MY FIRST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO REDUCE OUR STATE'S CONCEPTIONS OF FOSSIL FUELS AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION REGARDING. THE WORK FORCE WITHIN THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. AS THE STATE MOVES AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS A NEW DRILLING OR FRACKING INCENTIVES TOWARDS RENEWAL RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST INCLUDE. AT AT D. THIS BILL WILL LOCK IN FOR COME. FOR DOLLARS WORKING ON LARGE PROJECTS THAT OP INTO THE PUBLIC PROVIDED BENEFITS OF NAM. THE OTHER ACTION THIS BILL WILL TAKE ADDRESSES A NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITY INCLUSION AROUND THE BENEFITS OF NET ENERGY METERING. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON ROOFTOP SOLAR UPTAKE- NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM UC BERKELEY STUDY IN FROM THE PUC'S OWN REPORT ON AFFORDABILITY IS THAT RATEPAYERS IN UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THEM AND THAT THE KASHIF MAKES THE RATE BURDEN HIGHER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONLY TO. THE REBATES WHEN THE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE WENT TO AFFORDABLE OR MULTI HOUSING UNITS A HOUSING. HOW CAN WE ADDRESS DISPARITIES IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEM- AND DON'T KNOW IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY EXIST. AVAILABLE HERE TO TESTIFY ON THIS BILL WILL BENEFIT WORKERS UNDER READ UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES HAS GOT WEDGED. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL. THANK. REMEMBER THAT WHICH HAVE TO ASSOCIATION FOR CAL. OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES LET ME TO THIS BILL. BOTH PARTS. THE ENERGY POLICY PARTICULAR THE SOLAR CITY CAL IS THE MOST WOULD. POLICY THAT WE HAVE- AS REFERENCED BY THE AUTHOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPENT THREE BILLION% DOLLARS ON THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE KNOWN AS THE HONORS COURSE **** MILLION SOLAR ROOFS. WE SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN 2% OF THAT WENT TO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING- OR- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- THE VAST MAJORITY THAT MONEY WENT TO COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL AND- MARKET RATE HOUSING. IN WEALTHY COMMUNITIES THE NET METERING PROGRAM. HAS BUILT TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT'S HUGELY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THE MEGA WATTS. IN ON MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES YOU MIGHT ASK LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OUT OF TWELVE THOUSAND. THE HAAS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AT UC BERKELEY. CONDUCTED A STUDY LAST YEAR THAT FOUND THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO ROOFTOP SOLAR EVEN WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INCOME. WHAT'S THAT TELL YOU REDLINING IS HAPPENING A PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST PORTION OF THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU GET A REPORT EVERY YEAR THE BREAKS DOWN WHERE THE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE HAPPENING ON A CENSUS TRACT BASIS TO EACH MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD SAY WHY IS MY COMMUNITY NOT BEING SERVED OR- WIRE PARTS MAKING ME NOT BEING SIR. SECONDLY THE BILL WOULD APPLY PREVAILING WAGE ON JUST. THE VERY LARGEST- ROOFTOP SOLAR PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEW M. PROGRAM. OKAY THE BILL WOULD WOULD AFFECT 3% OF ALL ROOFTOP SOLAR ARRAYS BECAUSE WE THREAT PUT THE THRESHOLD AT FIFTEEN KILOWATT HOURS. WHEN YOU PUT ROOF TOP SOLAR ON YOUR BUSINESS OR ON YOUR HOME. YOU RECEIVE TAX CREDITS YOU RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. YOU MOST YOU YOU ALSO RECEIVE. A FULL RETAIL RATE FOR THE ENERGY THAT YOU PRODUCE THAT EVERY OTHER REPAIR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO DOESN'T HAVE SOLAR PAYS OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO PROVIDE TO YOU- THIS IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL WHERE WE SHOULD REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE ALL THE JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE HEAVY EMITTING INDUSTRIES UNDER AB THIRTY TWO- THE JOBS THAT WERE CREATED TO REPLACE ALL THOSE GOOD PAYING JOBS HAVE PER MERRILY BEEN ROOFTOP SOLAR. UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER DID A STUDY THAT FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE- SOLAR INSTALLER INSTEAD A CALIFORNIA MAKES NEARLY TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR TOTAL PACKAGE LAST POINT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD. COMMISSION TO STUDY. THAT FOUND IN THAT STUDY THEY FOUND THAT IF YOU WERE TO ADD PREVAILING WAGE. TO ROOFTOP SOLAR ON THE FRONT END IT WOULD INCREASE THE COST BY 325% BUT THE STUDY WENT ON. TO CONCLUDE THAT BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER SKILLED WORK FORCE THAT THAT NEGLIGIBLE INCREASE WOULD ACTUALLY BE NEGATED THAT WASN'T IN I. B. W. STUDY THAT WAS A STUDY WAS COMMISSIONED BY STATE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD. FOR ALL THE ABOVE REASONS WE URGE AN AYE VOTE AND WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. THANK YOU MR CHARMERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND SPORT THANK YOU. THEY WERE ON THE PHONE.

GOOD AFTERNOON AND CHAIR AND MEMBERS KIM STONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR AND STORAGE ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL BUT STRONG- OPPOSITION- I WANT TO REFER YOU TO- WAS A JOINT AGENCY REPORT PUT OUT BY THAT- CARB THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OFF. OPERATOR IF YOU SEE AN OFFICE- AND OPR CALLED AT THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE AT LAST FALL AND IT MENTIONED- THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL CLEAN ENERGY GENERATION GOING FORWARD JUSTICE OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CO AUTHORED AND WE NEED CLEAN ENERGY GROWTH IN ORDER TO MEET OUR S. B. ONE HUNDRED GREENHOUSE GAS FOR TEN GOALS. THAT REPORT STATED THAT SOLAR- RATES MEAN NEED TO NEARLY TRIPLE AND BATTERY STORAGE BUILD RATES NEED TO INCREASE BY NEARLY EIGHT FULL THIS IS NOT THE TIME AS WE BECOME INCREASINGLY ELECTRIFIED TO PUT THE BRAKES ON THE GROWTH OF SOLAR AND THIS BILL WOULD SLOW DOWN- ARE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS IT WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS. AND- CALLING AND OTHER BASED PRIVATE ENDEAVOR IF THE HARDWARE STORE OR- THE RESTAURANTS- PUTS OF SOLAR PANELS ON ITS PARKING LOT YOU KNOW OF A LARGER SIZE THAN THAN YOU WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW IN A TYPICAL RESIDENTIAL THAT DOES NOT MAKE. THAT PROJECT- A PUBLIC WORK AND IMPOSING THE COMPLICATED REALLY SORT OF BYZANTINE REQUIREMENTS ON DOING A PUBLIC WORK WE HAVE MEMBERS WHO HAVE DONE- PUBLIC WORKS AND THERE'S NOT. EVEN A CLASSIFICATION FOR A SOLAR INSTALLER- FOR DOING THAT WORK IT'S VERY- BURDENSOME PUTS ON TRUMP ANNOUNCED- OF RED TAPE AND WILL MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED. US SMALL BUSINESSES AND WHAT SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES CHEWING- SOLAR INSTALLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA- THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SOLAR INSTALLATION MORE EXPENSIVE PARTICULARLY IN OUR INLAND REGIONS IT WILL- THE- SOLAR MARKET IS BECOMING INCREASING LEE- ACCESSIBLE TO MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO RAISE THE COST JUSTICE- THE TELEMARKETERS BECOMING MORE ACCESSIBLE. WEEK THEREFORE MUST RESPECTFULLY- OPPOSE THE BILL THIS IS. SORT OF A DIFFERENT VERSION OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY NINE- FROM LAST YEAR. I AND THE SOLAR. IS HONESTLY FIGHTING FOR ITS SURVIVAL- ON MULTIPLE FRONTS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO SURVIVE- FOR ALL OF US AND FOR OUR FUTURE. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION. AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON PAUL WOODS WITH CALIFORNIA ADVISORS ON BEHALF OF pTHE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. AT A MODERATE OR ANYONE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE. BURNSAP ADDITION A FUND AND THEY WROTE. AND WE WILL BOOK THE LINE NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES. HI JENNIFER TANNER ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND VOTERS FROM THE TWENTY TWO GROUPS THAT SIGNED THE INDIVISIBLE CALIFORNIA GREEN CAN LETTER OPPOSING AB TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE YOU ALL HAVE THAT LETTER WITH OUR ARGUMENT WE RESPECTFULLY PARTICULARLY OPPOSED TO ANTI CLIMATE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. REVOKED A LOT NUMBER EIGHTY TWO LINE NUMBER EIGHTY TWO. STEPHANIE BROWN ON BEHALF OF TOGETHERWE WILL INDIVISIBLE MONTHS CONDOS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MY NUMBER ONE OH SEVEN. IF IT'S A REBEKAH ELLIOTT WITH INDIVISIBLE SANTA FE OF THE CALIFORNIA EIGHT BRONX INDIVISIBLE GROUPS AND INDIVISIBLE GREENSTEIN WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSE AB. TWENTY ONE FORTY THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU THE KEIRA MISTER CHAIR I HAD. GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU STILL NEED A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. I WOULD JUST SAY LOOK- YES SIMILARLY. I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA THANK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FORD AND I THINK IT'S A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEPLOYED SOLAR MAKE SURE MORE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ADOPT SOLAR ALSO BENEFITING FROM THE NEW IN INDUSTRY I THINK IT'S A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH BELL OF COURSE I REPRESENT A CONSTITUENCY THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THAT AND I'VE OFFICE BUYERS LAWYER WITH TOP OWNERS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TAT WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT. TO PAY WORKERS FAILING I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY WE'RE USING THE PUBLIC WORKS CODE I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AS BY OUR REGION PUBLIC WORKS IS THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S MORE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WILL BE BUILDINGS I JUST WONDERING. WHY PROTESTS AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU- DID THE MISNOMER THIS IS- I THINK THE IMPLICATION THE THAT WITNESSES IN UP WAS. THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE MAKE EVERY INSTALLATION OF ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT QUALIFIES A PUBLIC WORKS. ALL PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS PAY PREVAILING WAGE ALL PROJECTS WERE PREVAILING WAGES REQUIRED ARE NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC WORKS WHEN YOU'RE A PUBLIC WORKS THAT BRINGS INTO INTOIT YOU KNOW THERE'S APPRENTICESHIP REQUIREMENTS THERE'S A COMPETITIVE BID LOW BID REQUIREMENTS ALL THOSE THINGS THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH ANY OF THAT. THIS BILL DOES THE CITIES ARE GOING TO BE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS IT SAYS THE PREVAILING WAGES SHALL APPLY OKAY THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IT JUST GETS TO THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID TO THE WORKERS INTERNS THAT ARE INSTALLING THEM. AND AGAIN IT ONLY APPLIES TO PROJECTS OF FIFTEEN K. W. IN LARGER WITCHER THESE ARE THE LARGEST OF THE LARGE RIGHT SO THIS ISN'T. AS WE SORT OF INTIMATED. SOMEWHAT MOM AND POP SMALL LITTLE YOU KNOW HOMEOWNERS SETTLED WITH THIS IS EITHER GOING TO BE REALLY. LARGE REYES. YOU'RE A IS IT SEVENTY. PANELS OKAY THINK ABOUT HOW BIG'S PANELS IS SIXTY NINE ACTUALLY BUT CLOSE ENOUGH- SO IT IT DOESN'T DESIGNATE THESE PROJECTS AS PUBLIC WORKS IN THE TOTAL DEFINITION OF WHAT A PUBLIC WORKS AS IT JUST APPLIES PREVAILING WAGE. THANK YOU FOR OUR PATIENT ALSO POINTING OUT THE EQUITY APPOINTED TO IT'S ABOUT LARGE SOLAR ARRAYS AND NOT JUST THE AVERAGE COUPLE SOLAR ARRAYS THAT EVEN OUR FEATURED MY- HOME DISTRICT SO I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER THANK YOU SOME OF THE COMMENTARY ON ON FOLKS CALLING IN IN OPPOSITION THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR WHICH WAS THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS. OF THE BILLS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD SO TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT. THIS IS A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THAT BILL IT'S NOT THAT BILL AT ALL- IN FACT WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA NECESSARY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY. ENSURE ONE FIRST AND FOREMOST AT THIRTY IN THE CONVERSATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND SOLAR. SO WHILE THIS PERTAINS TO LARGE SCALE ROOFTOP SOLAR. IF YOU ARE A- MULTI MANSION MAC MANSION OWNER. WHY ARE YOU TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SUBSIDY THAT ACTUALLY IMPACTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND RENTERS. IN THE REPORT- THAT ACTUALLY WAS PUT TOGETHER BY THE P. UC TITLED- UTILITY COSTS IN THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID OF THE FUTURE. THE REPORT ITSELF THROUGH AN AND DIDN'T STUDY. CLEARLY LAID OUT THAT. THE ROOFTOP SOLAR INITIATIVE THAT WE HAVE NOW THROUGH MA'AM THAT THE P. YOU SEE HAS FAILED TO ACT TO REFORM. HAS BENEFITED WHITE AND WEALTHY HOMEOWNERS AT THE COST AND THE COST SHIFT OF RENTERS AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THIS IS WHY WE ARE NOT INITIALLY TOP- ACTUALLY. DOING IT RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP BUT WE ARE REQUIRING THE P. YOU SEE TO HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT NOT ONLY SPEAKS TO SIP COATS. BUT THE CENSUS TRACKS THAT WILL GIVE US THE DATA NECESSARY ON ETHNICITY AND INCOME TO ENSURE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE THE REPORTS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO EQUITY WHEN IT COMES TO RENEWABLE ENERGY. SO THE CONVERSATION AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE JUSTICE AND THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON THE GREEN NEW DEAL INCLUDES A PILLAR THAT SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE JUSTICE MUST INCLUDE. A TRANSITIONAL WORKFORCE FOR CLEAN GREEN RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS SO YOU CAN'T SAY LESS SHUTDOWN FOSSIL FUELS BUT LET'S ALSO NOT PAY WORKERS THE RATE THAT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING TO MAKE A LIVING WAGE AND BE ABLE TO LOOK IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. THESE CONVERSATIONS GO HAND IN HAND YOU CAN BE A CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE JUSTICE ACTIVISTS AND YOU SHOULD BE A LABOR ADVOCATE IN THE LABOR ACTIVE- ACTIVIST AS WELL YOU CAN BE. TRADITIONALLY YOU ARE BOTH YOU CANNOT SAY THAT YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT CLIMATE AND THEN NOT CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU ALLEGEDLY ARE TRYING TO SAVE. SO THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE COMPLICATED THEY ARE. NEW CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE HAVING AS WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH WE TALK ABOUT ENERGY AND THE WAY THAT WE- BRING IN A NEW. CLEAN GREEN ENERGY WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS ALL THE BENEFITS TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE STATE AND TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY THIS IS WHY LABOR IS A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION THIS IS WHY. AT THE BARE MINIMUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVAILING WAGE THAT'S THE MINIMUM THAT'S THE FLOOR THAT'S NOT THE CEILING THAT'S THE FLOOR. SO WE ARE IN A IN A NEW SPACE- AND I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW AS WE CONTINUE MOVING THE CONVERSATION FORWARD THAT WE HAVE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS AND CLIMATE ADVOCATES UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY TO BRING IN LABOR AND TO BRING IN WORKERS INTO THE CONVERSATION AND- WEBER. THANK I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW BACK DISTRICT SPA THE CLARITY OF IT DOES NOT CHANGE. THE DEFINITION PUBLIC WORKS IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THAT. THAT THAT MAKE A PUBLIC WAS JUST THE PURPOSE OF PAYMENT. OF THE PREVAILING WAGE IS SOMETHING SOMEBODY TO BUILD THE BUILDING TRADES PEERS AGO THAT TO DO WITH THE SUBSIDIES- SOME OF WHICH WENT. TO DEVELOPERS ARE BUILDING HOUSING OR OTHER KINDS OF PROJECTS- WE WERE JUST. FOCUSING ON PREVAILING WAGE MAKING SURE LOOK AT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES SUBSIDY ABOUT SIZE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONDITIONS ON THE KIND OF WORK PRODUCT THAT'S COMING FROM THAT- AND SO LOOK THIS ISSUE. HAS CONTINUED TO COME UP AS AN ENTITY TO COME UP. AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT. INTERESTS AND- NOT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE BUILDING BUILDING AND PUTTING UP THE- SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR THEY HAVE AN INTERESTIN IT- YOU HAVE. THE WORKERS AND THOSE REPRESENTING THE WORKERS HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT. YOU HAVE THE ACADEMICS- THAT ARE COMING FORWARD WITH THE RAW DATA AND- OF THE- INDEPENDENT DATA TELLING US WHAT'S HAPPENING. YOU HAVE THE ACTIVISTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THE WORKERS AND YET THE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS- THAT ARE SAYING LOOK WE HAVE TWO MORE BECAUSE WE DO EVERYBODY AGREES WE HAVE TO DO MORE- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT. IT DOESN'T. DO US GOOD. IF WE'RE FOCUSED SO MUCH OF THESE ARE LARGE PROJECTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. OKAY YOU'RE TALKING MONTHS ALMOST SEVENTY PANEL SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD SOLAR INSTALLATION. I HAVE A LOT MY DISTRICT I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF POOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ALMOST ZERO. IN MY DISTRICT YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. ARE THE ONES ON THE ROOF PUTTING UP. THE PANELS. ARE MAKING CLOSE TO MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO WE HAVE TO COULD BE CONCERNED EQUALLY ABOUT BOTH THE WE- AND SO. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A THAT I'M IS ARTISTS OF THE EXPANSION SOLAR POWER POWER SYSTEM. MANY YEARS IN THE COUNCIL AND I CONTINUE TO BE. BUT WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE WORKERS. THAT ARE PUTTING UP THOSE PANELS ON THESE AGAINST LARGE PROJECTS AND THE DATA COLLECTION IS CRITICAL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WITH THE REST. RIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED THAT DAY ALL OF US SEE THAT DATA. TO FIGURE OUT. IF THE PROGRAM COULD BE DONE BETTER DONE DIFFERENTLY- IT'S BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM LIKE A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES INITIALLY IT'S THOSE A HOW THE WEALTH. LOGICAL CARS OR EXAMPLE DOES HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE ABLE TO BE THE FOR EARLY ADOPTERS BUT WE CANNOT BE SUCCESSFUL UNTIL WE GET EVERYONE. THE ABILITY TO ADOPT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN THE MEANTIME. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AND INSTALLING THEM. NEEDED HAVE WORKED WITH DIGNITY AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GREAT.% FIRST STEP I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE INCLUDING MY DEAR FRIENDS INDIVISIBLE TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THE WORKERS AND HOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER. AND RECOGNIZE. THESE LARGE PRIVATE. COMMERCIAL PROJECTS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE LARGE SCALE THESE ARE PEOPLE OF WEALTH WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW. A LARGE COMMERCIAL COMPLEX WHICH WE CERTAINLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE. MORE SOLAR. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LET'S THINK ABOUT WHO'S ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK TO PUT THE SOLAR PANELS UP THERE. SO THE DOES THIS AS A JOINT I RECOMMENDATION- BUT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY FURTHER CLOSING COMMENTS. I THANK YOU MR CHAIR FOR THAT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INDULGENCE OF THE CONVERSATION- I HAVE THE LUXURY AND PRIVILEGE ACTUALLY I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ON ENERGY AND UTILITIES AND THIS HAS BEEN. ON THE ENERGY UTILITIES COMMITTEE. AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO. CALIFORNIA REACHING ITS CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS- IN LABOR COMMITTEE AND AS AS AS A STUDENT OF LABOR. YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF THE ORIGINAL. ENERGY PRODUCERS COAL MINERS. WHEN WE TRANSITIONED FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS THERE WAS A SECTOR OF WORKERS THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND GAS AND NOW WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO SOLAR TO WIND TO GEO THERMAL AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO RENEWABLE ENERGY THE CONVERSATION I'M ON THE WORK FORCE NEEDS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT LEAVING ANY WORKER BEHIND AND THEN AS WE ACHIEVE OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS WE ARE TRANSITIONING WITH THE FACE OF DIGNITY. EQUITY AND GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE AND THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE MINIMUM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I WILL.

WELL WE HAD OUR FIVE YEAR COOP ANNIVERSARY THIS PAST JULY THERE ARE MANY AREAS OF FRUSTRATION. THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WORLD LIKE ATTORNEYS ACCOUNTANTS INSURANCE COMPANIES AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DON'T KNOW WHAT COOPS ARE OR HOW TO PROPERLY SUPPORT THEM. EVERY YEAR I NEED TO BATTLE WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY FOR LITERALLY MONTHS WHEN THEY PERFORM THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION AUDIT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT PATRONAGE IS OR HOW IT APPLIES TO THEIR POLICIES OR CREDIT CARD COMPANIES THAT REQUIRE A PERSONAL GUARANTEE ON A COMPANY. EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A MAJORITY OWNER- OR THE COMMERCIAL LANDLORD THAT WANTS. TO CONTINUE MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE. WITHOUT MORE AWARENESS AND PROGRAMS THESE CHALLENGES WILL NOT GET ADDRESSED.
