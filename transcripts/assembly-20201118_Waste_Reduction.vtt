CAN DO TO HELP US CLIMB OUT OF

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.998
THIS- LAST WEEK MOUNTAIN THAT

INFORMATION THAT I'M SHARING

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.446
FROM MONDAY'S PLASTIC HEARING

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:49.981
WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS FRAME IT

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.616
IN CODE IMPACTS ON THE

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:53.918
RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.953
SYSTEM. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.154
SO THE DATA THAT I'M GOING TO

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.289
SHARE IS AN ALL FROM TWENTY

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:00.258
TWENTY- BUT WHAT IT

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:00.858
DEMONSTRATES IS THAT MANY OF

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:01.926
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.761
FACING TODAY. TODAY AS A RESULT

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:08.499
OF COVERAGE- HAVE BEEN GOING ON

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:09.800
FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND WHAT

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.068
CODE IS DONE IS IT'S FURTHER

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.937
EXACERBATED THESE CHALLENGES

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.238
RECYCLING HAS BEEN DECREASING

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:16.040
STATEWIDE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.308
WERE WITH ANOTHER ALL TIME HIGH

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.311
OF 50% IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.979
RECYCLE 37% OF WHAT WE

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:24.048
GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. ALONG

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:25.883
WITH DECLINING RECYCLING RATES

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.884
THERE'S BEEN A CORRESPONDING

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.654
INCREASE IN GENERATION OF

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.322
MATERIAL AND DISPOSAL. WE

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.523
HAVEN'T SEEN TWENTY TWENTY

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.158
RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL DATA YET

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.560
BUT WE KNOW WE WON'T WON'T MEET

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:37.495
AB THREE FORTY ONE SCHOOL OF

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:39.897
75% RECYCLING BY TWENTY TWENTY.

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:43.067
NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT'S ENDING UP

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.502
IN THE WASTE STREAM THIS PIE

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:45.570
CHART OF THE FAMILIAR FROM

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.405
MONDAY. BUT WHAT YOU CAN SEE

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.306
HERE IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.174
PACKAGING AND PACKAGING RELATED

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.442
MATERIAL IN THE WASTE STREAM

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.077
HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:55.112
SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. BOTH AS

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:56.280
A PROPORTION OF ALL MATERIALS

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:59.050
AND ALSO IS TOTAL TONNAGE. THE

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:00.284
INCREASE IN BOTH PLASTIC AND

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.420
PAPER PACKAGING. IS SIGNIFICANT

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:04.121
BECAUSE IT'S DEMONSTRATING.

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.990
THAT THE GENERATION OF THESE

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:08.059
MATERIALS IS SURPASSING A

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.627
RECYCLING SYSTEMS ABILITY TO

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.662
MANAGE THESE MATERIALS. WILL

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:12.363
HAVE ANOTHER WASTE

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.598
CHARACTERIZATION BEGINNING IN

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.166
THE TWENTY ONE. WILL HAVE A

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:16.567
BETTER SENSE OF HOW COLD IT IS

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.603
IMPACTED DISPOSAL. WE'RE ALSO

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.037
ADDING NEW MATERIAL TYPES LIKE

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.773
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.341
TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:25.042
MUCH WE'RE DISPOSING. AS WE'VE

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.911
ALL WITNESSED AN INCREASE IN PP

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.479
AND DISPOSAL CORRESPONDS WITH

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.681
AN INCREASE IN PTP VETERAN TO

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:32.216
OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE'VE ALSO

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:35.252
SEEN THIS WITH THE INCREASE IN

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:35.753
SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.523
PRODUCTS. ON WHAT IS SHIFTED

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.025
HOW WE RECEIVE AND UTILIZE

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.493
GOODS AND SERVICES WHICH IS

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.995
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INCREASING

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:49.233
GENERATION OKAY NEXT SLIDE. IN

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.235
CALIFORNIA WE COUNT EXPORTED

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.970
RECYCLABLES IS RECYCLED WE

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.205
EXPORTED FRACTION OF OUR

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.673
VOICESTREAM HISTORICALLY

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.242
ACCOUNTED FOR UP TO A THIRD OF

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.776
ALL MATERIALS RECYCLED IN

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:01.178
CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.947
THIS CHART. THE AMOUNT THAT

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:03.914
WE'VE BEEN EXPORTING HAS

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.250
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.084
ALTHOUGH THIS DECREASE HAS

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.686
IMPACTED OUR OVERALL RECYCLING

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:10.821
RATES IT'S A GOOD THING. MUCH

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:11.789
OF WHICH WE ARE EXPORTING TO

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:12.890
FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.225
MATERIALS THAT DID NOT HAVE TO

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:15.960
MASTER MARKETS HERE WE HAVE NO

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:17.428
WAY OF TRACKING WHEN WE EXPORT

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.796
THOSE MATERIALS IF THEY'RE

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:19.997
ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.732
ANOTHER. SO WE DON'T KNOW IF

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.667
THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.235
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL

00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.236
CHALLENGES IN THESE OTHER

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:31.275
COUNTRIES. BACKSLIDE. SO ONCE

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:32.677
AGAIN WE'RE GENERATING MORE

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.945
MORE STUFF AND THESE CUTS IN

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.280
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NO LONGER

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.883
ACCEPTING STUFF. CHINA HAS A

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:40.051
PENDING FOLLOW BASEBAND

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.252
FOLLOWING THE NUMBER OF

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.286
RESTRICTIVE POLICIES THAT THEY

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.522
PUT FORWARD I'M ACCEPTING

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:45.990
RECYCLABLE MATERIAL SINCE ABOUT

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.825
TWENTY FOURTEEN. SOUTHEAST ASIA

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:49.093
ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.828
RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE AND THE

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:51.762
TWO MAIN MATERIALS THAT ARE

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.564
IMPACTED BY THESE RESTRICTIONS

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:54.832
ARE MIXED PLASTICS AND MIXED

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.667
PAPER WHICH DON'T HAVE STRONG

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.069
DOMESTIC MARKETS. THE BATTLE

00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:59.670
CONVENTION IS ADDING ON JANUARY

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.172
FIRST TWENTY ONE RIGHT AROUND

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:03.074
THE CORNER MIXED PLASTICS WHICH

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.141
WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.077
TRADE MIXED PLASTICS TO ANY

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.378
OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.447
SINCE U. S. IS NOT A MEMBER OF

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:11.682
THE BASIL CONVENTION. AND THEN

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:12.883
COATED IN HAS COULD HAVE

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.151
IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO MOVE

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.786
MATERIALS TO SHIPPING LINES

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.121
HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED AND MOST

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.389
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:19.323
SEEN HERE IN THE US FOR

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.292
RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL ARE ALSO

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:24.495
HAPPENING IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:27.865
AROUND THE GLOBE. NEXT SLIDE.

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:28.632
SO WHAT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.301
MAJOR FACTOR CODE THAT WE'RE

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:32.436
SEEING WELL THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.004
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER IN APRIL TWO

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:35.539
ADDRESSED ON THE RECYCLING

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:36.240
CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:38.409
COVERAGE ZERO WAS INTRODUCED TO

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:39.477
A LOT OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.845
RECYCLING CENTERS TO

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.246
TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THEIR

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.647
SIERRA BEAVER DAM SHOPPER

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:52.123
OPERATIONS OR REDUCE OPERATING.

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.224
HOURS IN ADDITION IT'LL TO AND

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.391
RETAILERS TO TEMPER SO THEIR

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:58.062
BEVERAGE CONTAINER BACK THE- OR

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.364
ORDER. IT HALTED A OF USE OF

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.666
THIS USE DISPOSABLE BAG BAN

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.567
MANY GROCERS RETAILERS COULD.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.569
OFF OR SINGLE USE JUST BAG. AND

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:06.470
AS A RESULT WE SEE INCREASE OF

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.038
THOSE BOTH OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:10.508
BEING TO. IN ALSO CONTAIN OUR-

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:13.811
STREAM. THE IARC'S FIRED. BUT

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.813
WE'RE STILL SOME OF IMPACT OF.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:24.155
THE RESTRICTIONS FROM. THE L.

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:26.557
ON THE YEAR WAS ISSUE FROM ON

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.325
NO ABOUT THE NINETEEN IT HOW

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:31.662
TRANSIT. SINCE THE CAL OSHA HAS

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:32.763
THE GUIDANCE FOR NON OF INTO.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.265
IN GROW STORES AND- INFORMATION

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:35.699
ON REASON BACKS BE SAFE USED

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:39.870
AND HAVE. CAN COULD BE SAFER.

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:40.871
SOME RECYCLABLE FACILITIES

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:41.438
TEMPORARY CLOSE DUE TO CAN

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:42.907
ABOUT STATE. THAT'S ABOUT IF

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.475
PEOPLE COULD NOT PRACTICALLY DO

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.644
IN THOSE THIS. DURING THAT TIME

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.412
SUMMERS. WENT TO WIN. WE DON'T

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.680
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH BUT WE

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:50.981
SHOULD GET A BETTER SENSE WHEN

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.684
WE RECEIVE OUR DATA FROM TWENTY

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.285
TWENTY RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:55.820
REPORTING SYSTEM. IT'S OUR

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:56.921
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAJORITY

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:57.888
OF THESE FACILITIES THAT HAD

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.623
INITIALLY SHUT DOWN HAVE RE

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.492
OPENED. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:02.393
REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:04.195
RECYCLABLE COLLECTION IN AN

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.529
INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:07.398
RECYCLABLE COLLECTION WHICH IS

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.866
A SURPRISE GIVING THE STATE

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:12.002
HOME ORDER. AND THE CLOSURE OF

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.469
BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:13.237
CALIFORNIA. SURE THERE'S BEEN

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:15.272
ACROSS THE BOARD DECREASE AND

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.473
RECYCLE. AND WITH THE TIGHT

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.009
SUPPLY OF RECYCLED PAPER AND ON

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:20.644
CARDBOARD THE PRICE OF

00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:21.812
RECOVERED PAPER INCREASED

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.314
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE SPAN OF A

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.382
FEW MONTHS. THE OPPOSITE IS

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.851
HAPPENING FOR PLASTICS GLOBAL

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:28.619
OIL PRICES HAVE DROPPED CAUSING

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:29.887
THE PRICE THE VIRGIN PLASTICS

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.689
TO DROP INCENTIVIZING THE USE

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:35.025
OF VIRGIN PLASTIC OVER RECYCLED

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:37.728
CONTENT. NEXT SLIDE. WE'VE SEEN

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:38.696
AN IMPACT TO THE BEVERAGE

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.331
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WE

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.498
INITIALLY SAW A SIGNIFICANT

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:43.334
DROP IN RECYCLING VOLUME

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.368
HOWEVER THE VOLUME HAS SLOWLY

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.703
STARTED TO GO UP AS THE STATE

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:49.373
HAS REOPENED. IN JANUARY OF

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.074
TWENTY WE HAD ABOUT 80%

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.309
RECYCLING RATE THIS ROPPED TO

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:55.512
ABOUT 47% IN MARCH. AND IS NOW

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.147
BACK UP TO THE LOW SEVENTIES

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:58.482
ONCE AGAIN THIS IS PRELIMINARY

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:01.552
DATA THIS DATA ISN'T MATURE BUT

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:02.186
THESE ARE THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:03.687
SEEING. THE SALES INCREASE

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.555
COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO A

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.123
VARIETY OF FACTORS BECAUSE OF

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.691
COVERAGE OR EATING AND DRINKING

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:09.460
OUT LAST AND INITIALLY PEOPLE

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:11.095
WERE STOCKING UP ON GROCERIES

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.030
AND BEVERAGES. TO HAVE AN

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.565
ADEQUATE SUPPLY AT HOME. THE

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:15.866
DECREASE IN RETURNS COULD BE

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.468
DUE TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WITH

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.469
THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:20.037
RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:21.572
SUBURBS THE SPEND A DEALER TAKE

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.774
BACK REQUIREMENTS. SUMMERSIDE

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:24.975
CENTERS DID NOT RE OPENED TO

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.477
ECONOMIC OR STAFFING REASONS OR

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:28.579
SAFETY CONCERNS. THERE'S ALSO

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.748
VARIATION ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.349
HOW GROCERS ARE ARE ON

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.318
RESPONSIBLE FOR. REDEEMING

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.186
BOTTLES AND CANS SOME GROCERS

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.621
CAN OPT TO PAY A FEE TO THE

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.857
DEPARMENT INSTEAD OF TAKING

00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:41.358
BACK CONTAINERS. HELLO RECYCLE

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.993
RELEASED AB FIFTY FOUR REPORT

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.261
TO PROVIDE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.562
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:47.398
CHALLENGES. SOME OF THESE

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:48.499
OPTIONS INCLUDED MORE

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.634
FLEXIBILITY FOR REDUCTION ON

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.002
THESE ACTIONS IN THE REPORT

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.504
COULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.038
COVERT IMPACTS THAT WE'RE

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:56.941
SEEING TODAY. EIGHTY SEVEN

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:57.541
NINETY THREE REQUIRING MINIMUM

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.143
RECYCLED CONTENT IS A TIMELY

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:00.778
AND IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:03.314
INCREASE RECYCLED CONTENT- AND

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.415
DRIVE DEMAND FOR THE CLEAN

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:05.616
MATERIALS THAT THE BEVERAGE

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:08.252
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:11.255
PRODUCES NEXT SLIDE. I MENTION

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:13.857
THIS THIS CHART ON- ON MONDAY

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:16.026
AND- IT'S REALLY INTERESTING

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.628
BECAUSE IT GIVES US A SENSE OF

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:18.195
WHAT THE LONGER TERM IMPACTS

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.064
COULD BE. LOOKING TOWARDS

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.632
CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE DISPOSAL

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:23.167
RECYCLING RATES IT'S WORTH

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:24.068
LOOKING AT THIS CHART SHOWING

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.135
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:43:25.202 --> 00:43:27.304
DISPOSAL AND CHANGING JUST IN

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:29.406
CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE THEY

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.241
ARE VERY VERY CLOSELY TIED.

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:32.609
ECONOMIC GROWTH THE GENERALLY

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:34.878
MEANS INCREASED DISPOSAL THIS

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:35.846
IS NOT THE ONLY FACTOR BUT IT

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.548
PLAYS A ROLE. AS WE CONSIDER

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:38.782
THE LONGER TERM IMPACTS TO COPE

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:40.117
WITH NINETEEN CRISIS AND THE

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:41.719
RECESSION WE'LL SEE IF THIS

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.687
TREND CONTINUES AND IF DISPOSAL

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:46.657
DECREASES CORRESPONDINGLY. NEXT

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:48.826
SLIDE. SO THIS PART WILL ALSO

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.527
LOOK FAMILIAR HOW DO WE ADDRESS

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:51.428
THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.730
TODAY COVERT RELATED AND

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:54.264
OTHERWISE. AND I THINK THIS

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.767
MODEL- STAYS RELEVANT FOR THIS

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.569
CONVERSATION AS WELL. THE FIRST

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.504
IS TO REDUCE WASTE. THE SECOND

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.706
IS TO INCREASE YOUR USE COVERED

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:03.607
NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED THE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:06.110
ABILITY- TO USE REASONABLE

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.611
ALTERNATIVES TO DISPOSABLE

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.113
PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.148
STATEWIDE. WE'RE SLOWLY SEEING

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:12.850
THIS TREND REVERSES PUBLIC

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:13.951
HEALTH DATA IS SHOWING THAT

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:16.453
RESEMBLES CAN BE AFELY USED.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.855
WE NEED TO OPTIMIZE EXPAND

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:19.556
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.625
MANAGE OVER STILL GENERATING.

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:22.926
WE NEED ON TOP THEM AS OUR

00:44:22.993 --> 00:44:26.430
CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:27.564
EXPAND APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE.

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:28.732
RECYCLABLES ARE LOOKS. WE NEED

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:33.437
TO DO A RESPONSE. AND

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.305
SUPPORTIVE POLICIES ALSO PLAY A

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.474
SIGNIFICANT ROLE HERE- I

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.642
MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:39.276
MINERAL CONTENT RISK

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.645

SUPPORT SOURCE REDUCTION. MORE

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:45.582
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANY

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:46.950
FACTORS THAT ARE BRINGING THESE

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:48.519
MATERIALS INTO THE STATE THESE

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:49.953
CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.988
ON THE REPAIRS AND THE

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.022
JURISDICTIONS OUT THIS

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.824
INCREASED GENERATION IS

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:54.925
OVERWHELMING RECYCLING AND

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:57.628
SOLID WASTE. ALSO POLICIES THAT

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:01.865
THE AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.500
COULD HELP US SEE A REDUCTION

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.002
IMPACTS FROM KOBE. AND THE

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.403
OVERALL SOLID WASTE AND

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.539
RECYCLING CHALLENGES. NOW MY

FINAL SLIDE. ON SOME OF WHAT'S

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:12.810
AHEAD WILL HELP US ADDRESS THE

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:14.745
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED COVER.

RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FLOW AND

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.386
DISPOSAL THAT WE CAN BETTER

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:24.455

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.185
CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR

THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:36.693
PRESENT. I KNOW WE'LL HAVE SOME

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.663
QUESTIONS FOR FROM YOU- AND

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.734
COUNTY CYCLE IT GO. AND IF YOU

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.171
BELONG. TO FURTHER OKAY I KNOW

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:50.274
YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT- WHAT'S

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.675
HAPPENING ACROSS THE GLOBE

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.410
SPECIFICALLY IN ASIA AND OF

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.579
COURSE THE LAST YEAR'S ALL THAT

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.781
KIND OF. THE OTHER SOUTHEAST

00:46:57.848 --> 00:47:01.518
ASIAN COUNTRIES- AND- THAT HAVE

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:03.220
AN IMPACT AS WELL I JUST WANTED

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.855
TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS ON WHERE

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.925
AT THE RECYCLING AND PUT IT

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:08.659
NINETEEN. AS FAR AS THE

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:09.960
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:12.796
RECYCLING EXPORTS. WHAT

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.599
SPECIFICALLY HAS COVERED

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.936
NINETEEN DONE TO IMPACT THOSE-

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.704
SO I DON'T THINK HOPE IT'S

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.039
ACTUALLY IMPACTED THE

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:23.774
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS I

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.111
THINK WHAT IT'S DONE IS IT'S-

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:30.647
REALLY MAGNIFIED THE CHALLENGES

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:32.316
ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING HARD TO

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:35.052
RECYCLE MATERIAL AS A RESULT OF

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:35.786
THE INCREASED GENERATION THAT

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.588
WE'RE SEEING. OF MATERIALS THAT

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.556
WE TRADITIONALLY EXPORTED SO

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.358
FOR EXAMPLE SINCE THERE AREN'T

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.427
MANY DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:44.628
PLASTICS THREE THROUGH SEVENTH

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.830
WHICH MAKE UP A LOT OF OUR OUR

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:48.765
ON PACKAGING IN SINGLE USE

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:50.834
DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS WE'RE NOT

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:51.802
ABLE TO MOVE THOSE PRODUCT

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.937
THOSE ON RECYCLABLES TO OTHER

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:55.973
COUNTRIES WHICH MEANS WERE. E

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.140
HAVE A CHALLENGE TO HAVE TO

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.575
FIGURE OUT EITHER HOW TO MANAGE

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.077
THEM HERE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:01.979
TO MESS TO CONCUR STRUCTURE OR

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.213
REDUCE THE GENERATION OF THOSE

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.414
MATERIALS SO THAT THEY DON'T

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:07.251
CREATE CHALLENGES IN OUR

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.020
RECYCLING SYSTEM. OKAY AND THEN

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:12.055
SECONDLY WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:14.891
THE LONG TERM. IMPACTS AS FAR

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:17.027
AS KOBE NINETEEN AND A

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.329
RECYCLING SYSTEM. OR WILL JUST

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.831
GET BACK TO WHERE WE WORK WHICH

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.132
FRANKLY WASN'T GOOD IN THE

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.367
FIRST PLACE AS WILL GET AS ALL

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:25.969
GET ONTO BUT- HOW MUCH MORE. OF

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:26.970
A CHALLENGES ARE RECYCLING

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:29.006
GONNA BE AFTER THIS CALL THE

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.041
NINETEEN AREAS IS COMPLETED

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:32.743
BECAUSE OF COVER NINETEEN. IT'S

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:33.810
REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON A LOT

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:36.413
OF FACTORS ON THE FIRST IS WHAT

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.282
HAPPENS WITH GENERATION.

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:40.517
OVERALL IS A RESULT OF COVERT

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:41.551
ARE WE GOING TO DECREASE

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:42.953
GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.754
JUST DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.789
DON'T HAVE PREVIOUS DATA. TO

00:48:45.856 --> 00:48:46.556
SHOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH A GLOBAL

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:49.593
PANDEMIC- SO IT'S HARD TO SAY

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.361
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE CHANGE

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:53.697
IN BEHAVIOR THE INCREASED AND

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.631
ON THE RESIDENTIAL RECYCLING

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:55.899
STREAM. AND THE CHANGE OF

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:57.501
BEHAVIOR MEANING THAT-

00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:59.703
INCREASED AND GENERATION OF THE

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.771
SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:02.306
AND PACKAGING. IS REALLY

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.274
STRAINING OUR SYSTEM ONE OF THE

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.375
CHALLENGES WITH ON THE

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:07.978
RESIDENTIAL- RECYCLING STREAM

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:09.579
IS IT'S NOT AS CLEAN AS THE

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.014
COMMERCIAL RECYCLING STREAM

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.082
WHICH MEANS THAT PUTS A LOT OF

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.984
PRESSURE ON OUR SYSTEM. TO HAVE

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.319
TO SEPARATE OUT THOSE MATERIALS

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.853
TO CREATE CLEAN BELLS THAT ARE

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.522
ACTUALLY MARKETABLE. SO WHAT

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:19.890
WE'LL SEE IS MORE OF THAT

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.325
MATERIAL GOING TO DISPOSAL

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:22.959
BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION IN THE

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:25.228
SYSTEM. SO THE CHALLENGES ARE

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:27.097
GOING TO BE PROBABLY LESS

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.432
ABILITY TO RECYCLE MATERIALS

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:29.866
AND REALLY CHALLENGE US TO

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:30.934
THINK FROM A POLICY

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.235
PERSPECTIVE. HOW TO GET A

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.637
HANDLE ON ON WHAT WE'RE

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:35.072
GENERATING AND HAVE A REALLY A

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.606
LINE THAT WITH THE EXISTING

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:37.908
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:41.078
ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:41.812
WE WANT TO STAY IN THE STATE.

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:51.188
OKAY THANK YOU. BILL. SO IF I

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:52.155
KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:54.458
HOW TO HOW TO REDUCE WASTE AND

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.459
SO MANY DIFFERENT FRONTS

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:56.526
WHETHER IT'S INDIVIDUAL

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.395
PLASTICS AS WELL AS YOU HAVE

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.864
PACKAGING- WHAT ARE SOME OF

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:03.433
YOUR- YOU KNOW THOUGHTS

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.702
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:06.236
COULD. HELP HOW WE REALLY

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.305
SHOULD BE- MANAGING THAT

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.707
CONVERSATION OBISPO SORT OF

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:11.308
PUSHING THE ENVELOPE ON THOSE

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.777
ISSUES. YEAH THAT'S A GOOD

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.946
QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW. WE

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:17.414
REALLY THINK MINIMUM CONTENT IS

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.282
A GREAT START BECAUSE IT HELPS

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.484
ENSURE THAT THAT MATERIALS

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.119
ACTUALLY STAY IN THE SYSTEM AND

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.787
THAT WERE UTILIZING. THE

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.322
RECYCLABLE MATERIAL THAT WERE

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.990
THAT WERE GENERATING BUT BUT

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.458
YOU ASKED ALSO SPECIFICALLY

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:30.227
ABOUT SOURCE REDUCTION AND HOW

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.661
WE ENCOURAGE MORE MORE SOURCE

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:33.330
REDUCTION IN THE SYSTEM AND

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.164
THAT'S A CHALLENGE BECAUSE A

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.299
LOT OF THAT. IT'S DEPENDENT ON

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:38.301
TWO THINGS ONE IS- IS OVERALL

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.036
BEHAVIOR CHANGE OF THE CONSUMER

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:42.038
HOW CAN WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.507
THAT THAT ENCOURAGE SOURCE

00:50:43.573 --> 00:50:44.775
REDUCTION THAT ENCOURAGE LESS

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.410
USING LESS MATERIALS. AND THE

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.345
OTHER IS ON MANUFACTURE

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:50.046
RESPONSIBILITY ENSURING THAT

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:52.382
MANUFACTURERS ARE ARE DESIGNING

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:54.818
ON PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.087
THAT ARE REUSABLE THAT- ALIGNED

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.089
WITH THE SYSTEM BETTER BUT-

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.258
REDUCING GENERATION IS REALLY

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:02.526
IMPORTANT AND THEN ENSURING

00:51:02.592 --> 00:51:04.361
THAT WHAT WE'RE GENERATING.

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:05.929
REUSING RECYCLED CONTENT AND

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:09.032
THAT- IT ACTUALLY IS RECYCLABLE

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:11.334
COMPOSTABLE OR REUSABLE SO THAT

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.302
IT DOESN'T HELP THE OVERALL

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:13.170
GREENHOUSE GAS AND

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:16.139
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:16.706
WE'RE SEEING THESE PRODUCTS

00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:18.241
HAVE. YOU MAJORED. POSSIBILITY

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.276
I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT POINT

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:21.578
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU TALK

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:24.514
TO CONSUMERS. CONSUMERS WILL

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.450
ALWAYS TAKE CONVENIENCE AND

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:27.984
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IT'S

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:30.053
IN EVERYTHING IS DRIVEN TO. BE

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.087
MORE CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.189
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT'S

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:34.224
SORT OF ONE OF A COMPANY'S JOB

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:37.260
IS TO DO. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.463
RIGHT NOW IS THE PRICE OF THE

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:40.564
CONVENIENCE IN TERMS OF THE

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.599
IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT IS

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.767
NOT REALLY BEING FACTORED IN.

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:46.236
SO HAVE WE SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:48.238
ARE THERE ARE. OTHER PLACES

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:52.042
THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. START

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.911
TO FACTOR THAT PRICE OF

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.480
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION INTO

00:51:56.546 --> 00:52:00.851
THAT CONVENIENCE. YEAH IN END-

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.919
THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:04.354
GET IT THAT THERE'S ADVANCED

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.557
DISPOSAL FEES ON THEIR SHREW ON

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:08.258
EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:52:08.325 --> 00:52:11.061
RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS WHERE-

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.696
THE MANUFACTURERS ARE ARE

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.631
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END OF LIFE

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.799
MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING OF

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:17.901
THOSE PRODUCTS- THERE'S A

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.936
NUMBER OF MODELS THAT HAVE VERY

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:23.240
SUCCESS ON DEPENDING ON ON THE

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.774
UNIVERSAL PRODUCTS AND

00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:25.775
PACKAGING THAT THAT THEY

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:28.478
ADDRESSED AND HOW THOSE ON HOW

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:29.546
THOSE MODELS ARE ARE

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:31.548
IMPLEMENTED SO. FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:32.716
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:33.517
BIG BEVERAGE CONTAINER

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.318
RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH HAS ITS

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:37.888
CHALLENGES BUT IS ALSO- YOU

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:40.156
KNOW HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AS FAR

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.691
AS KEEPING A RELATIVELY HIGH

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:44.561
RECYCLING RATE AND DELIVERING

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:45.595
THAT THAT CLEAN MATERIAL THAT

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.365
CAN BE. RE MANUFACTURED INTO

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:49.533
OTHER BOTTLES AND CANS OR OTHER

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:52.002
PRODUCTS SO- IN THERE'S ALSO

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.403
ARE I DO WANNA MENTION THERE

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.404
ARE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:56.506
INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW- THE

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.542
ELLEN MACARTHUR ON A GLOBAL

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.377
PLASTICS PACT FOR EXAMPLE IS

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:01.711
ONE WHERE THERE IS ALSO A

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:02.445
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:05.181
INVESTMENT FROM INDUSTRY TO

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.449
INCREASE RECYCLING RATES TO

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.651
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:09.452
THAT THEY'RE USING TO INCREASE

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:11.187
RECYCLED CONTENT BUT WE JUST

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:13.456
DON'T KNOW IF THOSE. IF THE ON

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:16.092
OUTCOMES OF THOSE- INITIATIVES

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:20.530
WILL DELIVER WHAT. WE NEED TO

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:21.097
GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.699
ISSUE. ARE THERE STATE SIR OR

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.134
COUNTRIES YOU FEEL LIKE HEY

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.269
SHOULD REALLY. TAKE A CLOSER

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.572
LOOK AT WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:30.941
IN TERMS OF- YOUR TICKET TO GET

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:34.945
IDEAS FOR US. DEFINITELY AND

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.513
IT'S KIND OF DEPENDENT ON ON

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.114
WHERE YOU WANT TO LOOK YOU KNOW

00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:39.916
FOR BOTTLE BILL FOR EXAMPLE ON

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:42.419
THERE'S A REASON WHICH ORG AND

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.321
ON. YOU KNOW OTHER COUNTRIES

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.889
ARE IMPLEMENTING THEIR PROGRAMS

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.324
WHERE THEY'RE SEEING SUCCESS

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.824
THERE BUT THEY'RE VERY

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.593
DIFFERENT IN CALIFORNIA BUT I

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:50.961
STILL THINK THAT THERE'S ON

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.295
ELEMENTS OF THOSE PROBLEMS

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:52.929
PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.731
SIGNIFICANT FOR. SURE THINKING

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.999
ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:56.866
PROVE BOTTLE BILL AND SOME OF

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:59.703
THOSE ARE- INVITED IN ALREADY

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:00.870
FIFTY FOUR REPORT AND IN THE

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.238
ACKNOWLEDGE WHERE WE SEE THOSE

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:03.707
STRENGTHS IN OTHER COUNTRIES

THOSE MODELS THAT THAT. COULD

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:26.630
HAVE COULD BE SUCCESSFUL HERE

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:29.032
IT'S JUST. WOULD HAVE TO DESIGN

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.834
THEM FOR HOW THINGS WORK IN

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.302
CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

FOR JOINING US AGAIN TODAY- FOR

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.699
SECOND OF THESE TWO HEARINGS I

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.334
HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION WHICH

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.905
IS IF YOU HAVE A ARM BOTTLE OR

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:24.007
A CLAM SHELL OR ANY OTHER- BIT

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:26.810
OF PLASTIC- PACKAGING THAT IS

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.678
BEEN RECYCLED SO LET'S SAY IT'S

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.046
MADE OUT OF A 100% RECYCLED

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.048
CONTENT. CAN THAT. CAN I

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.850
PACKAGE BE RECYCLED YET AGAIN

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.385
HOW MANY TIMES CAN PLASTIC TO.

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:39.756
BE RECYCLED. YOU KNOW- I DON'T

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.991
KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER I DO KNOW

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:45.528
THAT- YOU KNOW P. T. NH DA ARE

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.297
ABLE TO BE RECYCLED MANY TIMES

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:48.932
BUT I COULDN'T TELL YOU THE

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.767
EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME- WITH

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.702
PAPER IT'S MORE CHALLENGING

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:53.970
BECAUSE EACH TIME PAPERS

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.872
RECYCLED THE FIBERS GET A

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:57.674
LITTLE BIT SHORTER. SO THEIR

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.276
ABILITY TO BE TURNED INTO ON

00:58:00.343 --> 00:58:01.945
ANOTHER PAPER PRODUCT EMISSIONS

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.046
WITH EACH TIME THAT THEIR

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.281
RECYCLED BUT WITH THAT SAID YOU

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:07.083
KNOW THEY STILL THE ON FOR

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.285
EXAMPLE COPY PAPER ON COULD BE

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.254
RECYCLED BACK INTO COPY PAPER A

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.522
NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE WOULD

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.490
HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW DOWNGRADED

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:16.526
TO ON A LOWER GRADE PAPER SO

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:17.527
IT'S REALLY DEPENDENT ON THE

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:18.494
MATERIAL TYPE AND I CAN GET

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:19.996
BACK TO YOU WITH- WITH MORE

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.431
DETAILS ON PLASTICS YEAH I'D

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:22.532
LIKE SOME SOME INFORMATION

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:23.800
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN CONFLICTING

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:25.068
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ABOUT

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:26.803
WHAT IT CAN BE RECYCLED INTO

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.038
AND HOW MANY TIMES- THAT YOU

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.006
KNOW SO BE GOOD TO GET SOME

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:32.775
CLARITY. FROM FROM CAL RECYCLE

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:35.044
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TECHNICAL-

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:38.147
DIFFICULTIES OR CHALLENGES- YOU

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.015
KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME AND I DON'T

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:40.149
KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY A

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.184
QUESTION BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.720
THAT. FOR MANY YEARS- INDUSTRY

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.688
HAS BEEN. REALLY PUSHING

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:48.024
RECYCLING AS AS YOU WOULD WANT

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:51.094
TO CERTAINLY AND- THEN

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.462
PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT WHEN

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.630
PLASTIC GETS INTO THE

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.530
ENVIRONMENT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:55.798
THE FAULT OF THE CONSUMERS THAT

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:56.432
THEY DON'T BEAR THE

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:58.167
RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BECAUSE

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.669
PEOPLE AREN'T BEHAVING WELL.

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:00.803
AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.305
NOT TRUE BECAUSE EVEN WHEN

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.841
PEOPLE PROPERLY DISPOSE OF

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:07.176
RECYCLED PRODUCTS MANY TIMES

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.344
THEY'RE NOT RECYCLE BECAUSE

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:09.646
THERE'S NO MARKET FOR THEM OR

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.648
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND THE VERY

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:14.918
SAME INDUSTRIES. THAT COMPLAIN

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:15.451
ABOUT THE LITTER BLAME THE

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:16.085
LETTER. I FOR THE LACK OF RE.

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:17.220
OR THE ONES THEMSELVES WHO ARE

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:20.089
NOT WILLING TO PAY EXTRA MONEY.

00:59:20.156 --> 00:59:22.125
TO USE THE RECYCLED CONTENT SO

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:22.926
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE EXTREMELY

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.861
DISINGENUOUS. TO SAY THAT IT'S

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:27.163
CONSUMERS. OR A LACK OF

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.264
INVESTMENT FROM GOVERNMENT

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.766
THAT'S CREATING THE PROBLEM BUT

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:31.067
WE OURSELVES DON'T WANT TO BE

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.402
ANY PART OF THE SOLUTION WE

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:33.202
DON'T WANNA PAY A COUPLE EXTRA

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.405
SENSE. FOR MORE EXPENSIVE

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:35.972
BOTTLE OR BOTTLE THAT LOOKS

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:40.610
DIFFERENT- SO- I FIND THAT VERY

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:43.112
INTERESTING- AND- YOU KNOW I

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:45.448
WOULD SAY THAT. YOU LOOKING AT

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:46.049
YOUR GRAPH ABOUT THINGS BEING

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:48.217
RECYCLED. WE HAVE BEEN TELLING

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:50.253
CONSUMERS FOR YEARS THAT ALL

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.621
THESE PRODUCTS ARE RECYCLABLE

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.622
IN THAT MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS AS

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.324
EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF PLASTIC

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.992
CAN BE RECYCLED ME MY HUSBAND.

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:57.827
WE WILL TAKE THE RAPPER OF

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.462
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND PUT IT

00:59:59.529 --> 00:59:59.996
IN THE RECYCLE BIN IS THIS

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:03.700
RECYCLABLE. RIGHT NOW YEAH OKAY

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.134
BUT HE THINKS IT IS BECAUSE WE

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.169
TELL PEOPLE THAT THIS IS ALL

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.971
RECYCLABLE THEN THEY

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.072
CONTAMINATE THE WAY STREAMING

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.107
MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SO

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:13.609
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT CONSUMERS

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.945
WANT CONSUMERS DON'T KNOW THAT

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.280
THE THINGS THAT THEY THINK ARE

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.514
BEING RECYCLED ARE NOT BEING

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:19.782
RECYCLED AND I THINK WERE

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.751
VASTLY UNDERESTIMATING. THE

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:22.785
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND THEIR

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.988
DESIRE TO HAVE A CLEAN

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.490
ENVIRONMENT TO BE GOOD STEWARDS

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:28.691
OF THE LAND TO BE SOCIALLY

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.493
RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.095
TELLING THEM THESE PRODUCTS ARE

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.496
AND WILL YOU HAVE A BLUE BIN

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.965
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS THROW

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:36.566
THIS STUFF IN THE BLUE BIN AND

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.001
YOU'VE DONE YOUR PART. SO THIS

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:38.901
IS THIS FICTION THAT'S BEEN

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:42.271
CREATED. BY INDUSTRY AND BY US.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.440
AND IT THE RESULT IS MOUNTAINS

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:46.576
OF. PLASTIC AND ARE FILLING UP

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:48.011
OUR LANDFILLS PEOPLE WANT TO

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:49.645
LANDFILLS NEAR THEM CLOSED THEY

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:51.381
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. THEY'RE

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:52.749
DOING ALL THIS RECYCLING

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.950
WEISS'S LANDFILL STILL FILLING

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:56.652
UP. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:57.253
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TELLING THE

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.590
TRUTH. I WAS ABSOLUTELY. YEAH

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:03.426
YES AND- MEANWHILE INDUSTRY

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.261
COMPLAINS THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.062
TO PAY MORE IF THEY SWITCH TO

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.330
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PACKAGING

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:07.997
WHERE IF THEY USE MORE

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.566
PACKAGING IF IT'S CLASSES HAVE

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.968
YEAR TO COST MORE THE PRODUCTS.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.069
BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT CLEARLY

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:13.870
TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT THEY

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:17.507
ARE PAYING THE COST OF NOT JUST

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.442
THE PLASTIC POLLUTION BUT

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.877
THEY'RE PAYING THE COST OF

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.111
DIVERSION THAT'S VERY VERY

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.112
DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.214
REFLECTED IN THEIR UTILITY BILL

01:01:25.281 --> 01:01:26.916
IN THEIR SWER FEE AND THEIR

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.017
LANDFILL FEES AND EVERYTHING

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.952
ELSE THAT MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:30.586
HAS TO PASS ON TO THEM THE RATE

01:01:30.653 --> 01:01:33.923
PAYERS. SO EVEN IF YOU BUY NO

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.524
PLASTIC EVEN IF YOU'RE SOMEONE

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.292
WHO. NEVER ORDERS FROM AN

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.994
ONLINE SOURCE WHO GOES OUT OF

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.629
THEIR WAY TO BUY GLASS.

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.230
PACKAGING YOU'RE STILL PAYING

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.965
AS MUCH AS SOMEONE WHO. IS

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.734
BUYING TONS AND TONS OF PLASTIC

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.203
SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.371
SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.606
WE'VE- PASSED CONTINUE TO

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.675
PROMOTE THIS FICTION ABOUT.

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.143

WHERE ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.714
SOLVED AND WE HAVE TO STOP

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.416
PROMOTING THAT FICTION WE HAVE

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.717
TO GET REAL WITH THE WITH THE

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:02.618
AMERICAN PUBLIC WITH THE

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.353
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. AND I THINK

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.589
THAT YOU WOULD SEE- REAL

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:07.824
BACKLASH OF PEOPLE REALLY

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.625
UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS WHAT WAS

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.961
HAPPENING HERE SO. I DON'T KNOW

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:12.595
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.597
TO RESPOND TO THAT THAT'S FINE

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.232
IF YOU DON'T THAT'S FINE TOO. I

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:17.600
JUST I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.234
YOU THERE'S BEEN AN

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.436
OVERSIMPLIFICATION. OF OUR

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.605
SYSTEM WHERE. YOU YOU PRINTED

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:24.607

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.675
DROP SOMETHING IN OUR BLUE BIN

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.410
AND WE MAGICALLY EPECT THAT IT

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.277
GETS TURNED INTO SOMETHING ELSE

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.546
WHEN THERE'S- A COMPLEX PROCESS

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:31.581
THAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT WERE

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.749

ARE CONTAMINATING THE RECYCLING

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.022
THE RECYCLING SYSTEM. SO

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:40.556
THERE'S A COMPONENT

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.824
MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBILITY

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.192

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.878
THIS PANDEMIC. BUT WE'VE ALSO

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.646
SEEN CHANGES AND BEVERAGE

01:06:57.713 --> 01:06:59.482
CONTAINERS THAT MOST CONSUMERS

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.851
PROBABLY ARE NOT AWARE OF AND

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.652
IS- HE SAID KOBE NINETEEN HAS

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.354
EXACERBATED PROBLEMS IN THE

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.089
RECYCLING INDUSTRY THAT ALREADY

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.326
EXISTED WE TOOK A DEEP DIVE

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.361
INTO THE DATA TO FIGURE OUT

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.397
WHICH CHANGES WERE DUE TO THAT

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.065
WERE ALREADY EXISTING AND WE'RE

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.433
CONTINUING TRENDS AND WHICH

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.001
TRENDS WERE SPECIFICALLY

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:21.604
RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:22.805
THE LAST TWO SLIDES IN MY

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.441
PRESENTATION ARE GONNA LOOK AT

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.509
THAT MORE DEEPLY. I TALKED

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.177
ABOUT A PERMANENT SHIFT IN

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:29.645
MATERIAL TYPES OR MAYBE SEMI

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.548
PERMANENT. ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.150
ALUMINUM CANS HAVE SEEN A HUGE

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.018
INCREASE MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.453
STAYING AT HOME AND WE'RE

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.622
WORKING AT HOME. AND ALUMINUM

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.457
CANS OF THE MOST POPULAR TYPE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.426
OF CONTAINERS FOR AT HOME USE

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.628
PARTLY OWING TO THE EASE OF

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.863
STORAGE OF TWELVE PACKS AND SIX

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.298
AND TWENTY FOUR PACKS AND

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.600
REFRIGERATORS- AND WE'RE ALSO

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:52.902
SEEING THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:53.969
AREN'T IN RESTAURANTS THEY'RE

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:56.005
NOT CONSUMING. DRAFT BEER THAT

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:57.706
COMES OUT OF CAKES THEY'RE NOT

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.375
CONSUMING FOUNTAIN DRINKS THAT

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:01.544
THEY WOULD NORMALLY CONSUME IN

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.446
RESTAURANTS OR TAKE OUT PLACES.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.880
SO THAT HAS LAGGED

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:07.483
INTERESTINGLY TO A COMPLETE

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.552
DISRUPTION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.153
THERE HAS LITERALLY BEEN A

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.155
SHORTAGE OF ALUMINUM CANS IN

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:15.458
THE UNITED STATES. THE CRAFT

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.327
BEER INDUSTRY WAS UP ENDED

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.663
OVERNIGHT WITH CLOSURES OF BARS

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.598
AND RESTAURANTS BECAUSE 50% OF

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.166
THEIR BUSINESS WAS DRAFT BEER

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.469
AND CAKES. THEY LITERALLY HAD

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:28.270
TO THROW OUT BEER AND

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.172
COORDINATE WITH MUNICIPAL SEWER

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.041
SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.777
DIDN'T OVERLOAD SYSTEMS- SO

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.245
SOME OF THEIR THEIR DECADE

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:38.180
BUSINESS WAS DOWN NEARLY A 100%

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:40.249
OVERNIGHT WHEN THE PANDEMIC

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.218
STARTED IN MARCH. AND SO THE

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:44.386
SHIFTED DRINKING AT HOME

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:44.887
BECAUSE IS MORE NEED FOR

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:47.623
BOTTLES AND CANS. THAT HAS LED

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:50.526
TO WHAT WE THINK IS A 6%

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:53.062
UPTICK. SEMI PERMANENT UPTICK

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:55.731
IN THE USE OF- BOTTLES AND CANS

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.733
SALES OF PACKAGED BEVERAGES IN

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.434
IT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.436
STATES. THERE WAS A FURTHER

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.304
DISRUPTION OF THE I'M SORRY

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.939
SLIDE TO PLEASE GO TO NEXT

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:04.773
SLIDE THERE WAS A FURTHER

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.841
DISRUPTION IN THE RECYCLING

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.543
SUPPLY CHAIN AS A RESULT OF THE

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.744
SUSPENSION OF THE DEPOSIT

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.179
RETENTION PROGRAMS AND ALL TEN

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.515
STATES. BUT FIRST I HAVE TO

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.350
EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS. NOT MOST

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.552
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS KEY FACT

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:17.653
THAT CONTAINERS THAT ARE ON

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.255
DEPOSIT DATA TREMENDOUS

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.690
INCENTIVE. TO TAKE BACK YOUR

01:09:21.757 --> 01:09:23.659
BOTTLES AND CANS LIKE THE C. R.

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.094
V. PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.695
CALIFORNIA BUT THOSE PROGRAMS

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:28.797
ONLY EXIST IN TEN STATES. THIS

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:31.200
CHART SHOWS HOW DRAMATICALLY

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:34.270
HIGHER. THE RECYCLING RATES ARE

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.471
FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ON

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.706
DEPOSIT THIRTY TWO OR THREE

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:38.674
TIMES SOMETIMES EVEN FOUR TIMES

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:41.176
AS HIGH. AS THE CONTAINERS THAT

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.279
ARE NOT ON DEPOSIT NATIONALLY.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.713
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT NEARLY

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.181
50% OF ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINER

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.683
RECYCLING COMES FROM JUST THE

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.251
TEN STATES THAT HAVE A BEVERAGE

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:52.855
CONTAINER DEPOSIT LAW. SO LET'S

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:53.689
LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.324
THREE. SO I SAID THAT I WOULD.

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.458
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.694
COVERTRELATED ISSUES AND NON

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.496
COVERT RELATED. WE HAVE A

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:03.532
FATALLY FLAWED PAYMENT FORMULA

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:04.900
FOR REDEMPTION CENTERS IN

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.069
CALIFORNIA. LEADING TO OVER

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:09.872
THIS PERIOD OF TIME- MORE THAN

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:10.706
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:12.174
THEY'VE BEEN UNDERPAID. AS A

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.043
RESULT HALF OF THE REDEMPTION

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.078
CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GONE

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.246
OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE LAST

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:19.381
FIVE YEARS. IT'S ALSO RELATED

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.950
TO DRAMATICALLY DECLINING

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:23.285
MARKET PRICES. LET'S LOOK AT

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:26.055
THE NEXT SLIDE. AGAIN THESE ARE

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.490
PROBLEMS THAT PRE THAT EXISTED

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.392
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED SO

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.328
THIS SLIDE SHOWS HOW WE'VE LOST

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.062
ALL OF THESE REDEMPTION

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.064
CENTERS. AND THAT MEANS THAT

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.299
THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE CROWDING

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.501
INTO FEWER REDEMPTION CENTERS.

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.804
IT ALSO THIS SITE DOESN'T SHOW

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.572
IT BUT MORE OF THE REDEMPTION

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:44.540
CENTERS HAVE BEEN LOST IN

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:45.741
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:47.576
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.744
SEE THE NEXT SLIDE AND SEE WHAT

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:52.514
THAT WITH THAT HAS A COST. THE

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.450
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS RETURNED IN

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:57.186
THESE- AND SELECTED SOUTHERN

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.788
AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. ACT

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:02.024
COMMUNITIES THESE COUNTIES. IS

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.994
NOW AT A PER CAPITA RATE OF

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.863
FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY. IN THIS IN

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.398
THE SECOND ROW OF DATA IN THE

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.700
CHART THE SELECTED NORTHERN

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:13.268
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THOSE THAT

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:15.638
HAVE RECEIVED AND HAVE SEEN THE

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:17.506
MOST REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSE.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.875
THEY'RE ONLY ABLE TO COLLECT

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.343
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.646
CONTAINERS PER CAPITA EVEN

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.547
THOUGH OUR CONSUMPTION IS.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.750
UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:28.817
THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS OF PICKED

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.219
UP A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SLACK

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:31.654
BUT THEY REALLY ONLY PICKED UP

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.554
ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.089
CONTAINERS THAT WAS LOST THE

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.257
REST OF BEEN LOST TO THE

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:37.092
LANDFILL. SO THESE ARE THE PRE

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:40.062
COBIT IMPACTS THE NEXT SLIDE

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:42.264
ALSO IS PRE CODED. I'M THE

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.866
SCRAP VALUES HAVE BEEN TRENDING

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.902
DOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:47.970
DOT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.805
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. P. ET

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.674
PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM CANS

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.275
ESPECIALLY THAT'S WHERE MORE

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:55.144
MOST OF THE REVENUE COMES FROM.

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.046
IT WAS SEEING DOWNWARD TREND IN

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:59.114
PRICING FOR MANY YEARS AND THEN

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.649
THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE CRASH

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.518
WHEN THE CORONAVIRUS HAPPENED.

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.453
ALL OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.354
ARE AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:08.157
THINGS. ALUMINUM CANS VERSUS PT

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:10.893
PLASTIC THEY ALL- TRAVEL DOWN

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.394
THEIR OWN PATH THEY ALL HAVE

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:13.562
THEIR OWN THINGS THAT THEY

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.863
COMPETE WITH THEIR ALL SUBJECT

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:19.001
TO WORLDWIDE TRENDS AS WELL AS-

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.070
AT LOCAL AND NATIONAL TRENDS. I

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.739
AM SO IN THE WORLDWIDE MARKET

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.841
ENERGY PRICES DO YOU IMPACT

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:27.910
COMMODITY PRICES WE ALSO HAVE

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.478
AN ISSUE WITH ALUMINUM CANS

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.979
WHERE CANNED SHEET

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:34.083
MANUFACTURING- WAS CLOSED DOWN

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.318
IN THE UNITED STATES AND- THE

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.953
BEGINNING OF TWENTY NINETEEN

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.456
AND SHIFTED TO SAUDI ARABIA SO

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.423
THAT'S ALL IMPACTING THIS AS

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.193
WELL- BUT THESE MATERIAL PRICES

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:46.061
HAVE. HAVE IMPACTED REDEMPTION

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.296
CENTERS TREMENDOUSLY IN OF LED

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.330
TO THE CLOSURE OF REDEMPTION

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.399
CENTERS AS WE TALKED ABOUT. SO

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:56.105
ON THE NEXT SLIDE. AM I JUST

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.140
WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.110
THE TAX CUTS THE COMMODITIES

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.411
THAT WE GENERATE THROUGH

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.946
RECYCLING OF OUR BOTTLES AND

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.647
CANS THE GLASS OF THE PT

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.750
PLASTIC THE ALUMINUM. IS IN

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.485
TREMENDOUS DEMANDS AND IS

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.653
TREMENDOUSLY NEEDED BY THE

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.721
MANUFACTURERS OF THOSE

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.757
CONTAINERS BECAUSE THEY ALL USE

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:15.657
SOME AMOUNT OF RECYCLED

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.760
CONTENT. THEY MUST HAVE THE

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.061
CONTENT IN ORDER TO MAKE NEW

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.896
BOTTLES AND CANS AGAIN AND ALL

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.831
OF THE MAJOR TRADE ASSOCIATIONS

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.900
SPOKE UP THIS YEAR AFTER THE

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:25.801
DISRUPTION THAT OCCURRED

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:27.736
BECAUSE OF THE CORONA VIRUS AND

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.138
THEY SAID WE ARE VERY MUCH

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.405
DEPENDENT ON THESE DEPOSIT

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.107
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AROUND THE

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:34.810
UNITED STATES. AND WE VERY MUCH

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:37.045
SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. SO

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.047
NARAL THE ON THE NEXT SLIDE

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:40.315
SLIDE EIGHT WE'LL LOOK AT

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.250
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IN

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:42.718
CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:47.256
CORONAVIRUS. THE SOLID LINE IS

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:47.756
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.625
CONSIDER THAT THE BASELINE OF

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.160
PACKAGED BEVERAGE SALES IN

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:54.429
CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE DOTTED

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.398
LINE IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:58.801
FIRST SEVEN MONTHS OF TWENTY

01:13:58.867 --> 01:13:59.735
TWENTY YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S IN

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.670
A RADIC AND JUMP AND THEN

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:03.939
DECLINE WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.874
THAT BEVERAGE SALES PEAKED

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.010
DRAMATICALLY IN MARCH THAT'S

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.244
THAT HUGE SPIKE THAT YOU SEE IN

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.946
MARCH WITH THE DOTTED LINE.

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.181
THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY WENT TO

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.215
THE STORE AND STOCKED UP ON

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.050
BOTTLED WATER AND OTHER

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.486
BEVERAGES AND AS THE PANDEMIC

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:19.721
BEGAN THEN YOU SEE A HUGE-

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:22.791
SHIFT DOWNWARD IN APRIL. AS

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.626
EVERYONE WAS- STAYING AT HOME

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:27.863
WITH ALL THAT MATERIALS ARE ALL

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.430
HAS BEVERAGES THAT THEY HAD

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:29.665
PURCHASED IN MARCH. THEN YOU

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:31.900
SEE IN MAY THAT THE DOTTED LINE

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.802
RISES ABOVE THE SOLID LINE

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:36.004
MEANING TWENTY TWENTY SALES ARE

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:38.574
HIGHER. DAN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.042
SALES AND WE'RE SEEING THAT

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:42.377
AROUND THE NATION SO BASICALLY

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.713
THIS SHIFT TO ADD HOME SHIFTED

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.317
AWAY FROM- FOUNTAIN DRINKS AND

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:50.452
CAKE DRINKS. MEANS THAT MORE

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.386
PEOPLE ARE BUYING PACKAGE

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.622
BEVERAGES AND THAT'S A SEMI

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.390
PERMANENT CHANGE AS LONG AS

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:56.592
WE'RE ALL STAYING AT HOME AND

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.293
OUT OF RESTAURANTS. WE'RE GOING

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.361
TO HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.296
BEVERAGE SALES INTO THE FUTURE

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.898
AND SO FAR WE THINK IT'S ABOUT

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.267
6% HIGHER THAN USUAL. THE NEXT

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.302
SLIDE. IS ACTUALLY THE LAST

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:10.105
SLIDE THIS LOOKS AT- CALIFORNIA

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.507
C. R. V. RETURNS. SO WHAT WE

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:15.110
SAW HAPPENING HERE HI I SHARED

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.245
THE STORY OF HOW THE REDEMPTION

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:17.412
CENTERS HAVE CLOSED THROUGHOUT

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:22.117
THE STATE THAT HAS LED. OVERALL

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.552
TO LAST REDEMPTION. LOWER

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.221
NUMBER OF UNITS REDEEMED LOWER

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.190
NUMBER OF UNITS RECYCLED.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.658
THAT'S A PERMANENT CHANGE BUT

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:31.526
YOU CAN ALSO SEE ON THE SLIDE

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:32.895
THE TEMPORARY CHANGE THAT

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.496
HAPPENED AGAIN IN MARCH AND

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.498
APRIL FRONT PREDOMINANTLY WHEN

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:39.935
THINGS CLOSED DOWN AND THE BLUE

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.870
DOTTED LINE SHOWS HOW

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.939
DRAMATICALLY THE CONTAINER

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:46.208
RETURNS DROP TYPE DURING THAT

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.876
JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU SEASON

THEY CAME BACK UP IN MAY

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.781
MANJINDER HIGHER. BUT YOU CAN

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.249
SEE THAT THE DOTTED LINE IS

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.817
STILL BELOW THE SOLID LINES

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.886
WERE STILL SEEING LAST AS A

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:59.187
PURPOSE PERMANENT OR SEMI

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.956
PERMANENT CHANGE COMPARED TO

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:03.325

IMMEDIATELY IMPACTED BY COPE IN

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:26.975
NINETEEN. BUT AS ESSENTIAL

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.944
SERVICE PROVIDERS IT WAS

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:31.246
CRITICAL- THAT THEY CONTINUE TO

BUSINESSES- BUT ON THE FLIP

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.448
SIDE WE SAW AN INCREASE IN

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.682
TONNAGE IN SERVICES IN THE

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:11.787

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.474
ISSUE- BUT OUR ASSOCIATION

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.209
RELEASED A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT TO

THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND INTO.

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:04.439
HOPEFULLY A RECOVERY PERIOD-

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:05.841
WE'RE FOCUSED ON HOW TO SUPPORT

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:07.442
CITIES AND RATEPAYERS IN

PROGRAMS AND REAL REGULATIONS

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.116
THAT ENCOURAGE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.584
DEVELOPMENT AS KEY TO

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.186
STIMULATING THE LOCAL COMIC

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.622

FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THE S.

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.060
B. THIRTEEN H. THREE

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.795
REGULATIONS WHICH WILL REQUIRE

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.396
RECYCLING OF ORGANIC MATERIAL

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.699
STATEWIDE BEGINNING JANUARY

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:33.034
ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.369
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.505

ORGANIC MATERIAL. I'M A WE ARE

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.411
VERY EXCITED- ABOUT THIS

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.314
OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE ALSO HYPER

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.183
AWARE OF THE ISSUES WE FACE IN

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.784
MEETING THIS IMPORTANT METHANE

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.987
REDUCTION GOAL AND THE COSTS

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:53.588
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UNFUNDED

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:56.625
MANDATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.426
SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE

01:19:58.493 --> 01:19:59.895
ORGANICS RECYCLING WILL

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.663
IMPLEMENTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.331
DEVELOPMENT WILL COST UPWARDS

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.233
OF TEN BILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.569
TO ACHIEVE. AND WITH SO MUCH

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.337
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THESE

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:12.240
EXTENDED FISCAL IMPACTS OF KOBE

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:13.108
NINETEEN SOME COMMUNITIES

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.142
NATIONALLY ARE NOW MORE

MEET THIS VERY IMPORTANT GOAL.

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.448
SO WE SEE A REALLY CRITICAL

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:22.117
NEED TO HARMONIZE OUR STATE

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.451
REGULATORY POLICIES AND

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.953
FRAMEWORKS TO INCENTIVIZE AND

ORGANIC RECYCLING PROGRAMS.

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.093
ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK TO BUILD

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.862
THE FACILITIES NECESSARY TO

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:35.397
MANAGE THIS MATERIAL.

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.332
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA LACKS

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.733
THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.202
MANAGE THE VOLUME OF ORGANIC

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.037
WASTE WE GENERATE. THE TWO

REASON THAT WE DIDN'T GO BELLY

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.808
UP IS BECAUSE WE OWN FIVE

FIFTEEN SEVEN TRUCKS SEVENTEEN

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.435
TRUCKS PER DAY. OUT OF OUR

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:32.006
OPERATIONS AND- I THINK THE

01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:33.474
LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IN

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:37.278
CLOSING IS THAT I SAW IN THE-

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:42.083
REPERTORY MATERIALS. HE HE- AT

THIRTY NINE CENTS A POUND IF WE

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:44.852
COULD GET THIRTY NINE CENTS A

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:46.788
POUND WE COULD PROBABLY SURVIVE

01:28:46.854 --> 01:28:48.089
AND CONTINUE DOING THE

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.857

THE CARD PRICE FOR MAKES PAY

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:19.587
WHICH IS THE SIGNIFICANT OUR OF

OTHERWISE POTENTIALLY ARE MIXED

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.493
PLASTICS WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.528

OKAY THANK YOU A LOT OF FOOD

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:12.507
FOR THOUGHT HERE- WHO WOULD

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:16.077
LIKE TO BEGIN QUESTIONING. I'LL

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.713
START WITH- A START WITH WHAT

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.047
WILL GO TO THE TOP SO WE'LL GET

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.850
SUSAN ON THE- SUSAN COLLINS ON

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:25.253
THE SCREEN THAT WE CAN. ASK YOU

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.954
QUESTIONS WE CAN GO DOWN. SO

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:31.025
CAN WE GET. HOW CAN WE JUST ARE

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.795
STOCKING YEAH I WANTED TO TALK

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:35.363
TO YOU ABOUT- THE STATISTICS

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:36.697
YOU TALKED ABOUT ALUMINUM I

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:39.834
FOUND THAT VERY. VACILLATING

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.868
AND I HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:42.804
EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE BEER

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.772
MARKET WHICH I I'M I'M A-

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.574
CONSUMER AND THEN NOT ASHAMED

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:48.442
OF THAT. I KNOW THAT FOR YEARS

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.444
A WOMAN IT WAS FROWNED UPON AND

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.513
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE CLASS BUT

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.516
EVEN BEFORE- THAT WE SAW A SHIP

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:56.217
FILLED SPENT BY THE CRAP.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.552
BREWERIES ARE GOING TO

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.654
ALUMINUM- FOR FRANKLY WAS IT

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.722
WAS CHEAPER- THERE CONSUMERS

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.224
DIDN'T MIND IT AND SO IT WAS

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.193
KIND OF A WIN WIN. SO I GUESS

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:06.828
THE QUESTION IS IF WE KNOW THAT

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:09.897
THAT THERE'S SOME- ITEMS WHICH

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:12.333
ARE ARE. HAVE MORE WORK IN THIS

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.369
KIND OF TALK ABOUT LAST SPEAKER

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.205
AS WELL MR BY A- SOME PRODUCTS

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:19.574
HAVE MORE OF A VALUE. IN IN THE

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.475
RECYCLING MARKET SHOULD SHOULD

01:31:21.542 --> 01:31:24.111
CALIFORNIA BE DOING ANYTHING TO

01:31:24.178 --> 01:31:25.847
PUT OUR THUMB ON THE SCALE TO.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:26.881
AND YOU KNOW INCENTIVIZE FOR

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.817
EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY BEER IS NOT.

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.719
PRODUCED IN PLASTIC BOTTLES.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.421
BUT OTHER PRODUCTS ARE SO

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:36.257
SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT-

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.793
INCENTIVIZING AN- YOU KNOW.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.494
SETTING POLICY TO PUSH A

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.462
CERTAIN DIRECTION WHICH WE

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:44.532
KNOW. PRODUCTS HAVE HAVE MORE

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:49.770
UPSIDE OF BEING RECYCLED. WELL

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:52.773
AS GREAT QUESTION AND- I'LL

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.976
ADDRESS THE ALUMINUM SITUATION

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.845
A LITTLE BIT FIRST TO ADD A

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:58.446
LITTLE MORE TO THE CONTEXT YOU

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.615
WERE GIVING. AND AS YOU SAID

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.717
BOTTLES USED TO BE PREFERRED

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:05.453
ESPECIALLY BY CRAFT BREWERS.

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:07.755
AND- TWO THINGS HAVE HAPPENED

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.190
ONE THERE'S JUST BEEN A GRADUAL

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:11.692
ACCEPTANCE OF A HAT ALUMINUM

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:13.728
CANS BY THE CRAFT BEVERAGE

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.730
CONSUMER. BUT THEN IN ADDITION

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.798
TO THAT DAY HE HAD TO SCRAMBLE

01:32:17.865 --> 01:32:20.468
SO MUCH TO CREATE A WAY TO AND

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:21.235
GET THEIR MARKET OUT INTO THE

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.938
MARKET PLACE. AND WITH THE

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:26.641
CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC AND- DAY

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.509
STARTED USING CANS BECAUSE THAT

01:32:28.576 --> 01:32:29.944
FEELING LINES ARE ESIER FOR

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:30.912
THEM TO INSTALL ON THE

01:32:30.978 --> 01:32:33.347
FACILITIES SO IN ADDITION TO

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:34.715
THAT THERE'S A GREATER USE OF

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:36.350
ALUMINUM BECAUSE THAT HARD

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:37.718
SELTERS HAVE BECOME SO POPULAR

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.220
LIKE WHITE CLAW AND THOSE ARE

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.222
SOLD. IN ALUMINUM CANS SO THOSE

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:41.956
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:44.392
SEEING AS A PERMANENT OR SEMI

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.961
PERMANENT CHANGE- BUT IN TERMS

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:49.463
OF INCENTIVIZING- IT CREATING

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.798
INCENTIVES OR CREATING

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:53.200
PENALTIES THERE THERE. YOU KNOW

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.069
THE TWO SIDES OF THE COIN-

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:57.538
ABSOLUTELY WE CAN DO THAT AND

01:32:57.605 --> 01:33:00.741
THAT IS DONE YEAH- WORLDWIDE.

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.077
THE TERM OF ART IS ECO

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:05.980
MODULATION FEES WE HAVE CERTAIN

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:07.815
FEES ALREADY THAT EXISTS IN THE

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:09.583
BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM IN

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:12.019
CALIFORNIA. AND ALL OF THE

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:13.421
MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO PAY FEES

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:15.589
INTO THE SYSTEM AND THAT HARDER

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:17.358
AND MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIALS TO

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:19.327
RECYCLE HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:20.795
THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:22.630
MATERIALS THAT ARE WORTH MORE

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:24.398
OR EASIER TO RECYCLE. M. BUT

01:33:24.465 --> 01:33:26.534
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH THERE-

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.202
THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY RICH

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.737
CONVERSATIONS IN A STATE WIDE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.305
RECYCLING COMMISSION ABOUT THE

01:33:31.372 --> 01:33:33.908
NUANCES EVEN WITHIN P. ET

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:35.810
PLASTIC THERE'S GREEN PLASTIC

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.712
VERSUS CLEAR PLASTIC AND THOSE

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:38.946
ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:42.450
WORLDS- SO. WE CAN WE CAN

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:44.085
IDENTIFY WHERE THERE ARE

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:47.788
BARRIERS TO RECYCLING AND WE

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:48.589
CAN SET THE PENALTIES AND SAYS

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:51.025
HONEST TO GET THE RESULTS WE-

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:55.629
OKAY. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.231
QUESTIONS FOR THE SPEAKER.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:34:01.402
MISTER CHANG. I JUST WANT TO GO

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.204
BACK TO YOUR CHART YOU HAVE

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:06.974
THAT- DIAGRAM SHOWING THE LOS

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:09.210
BETWEEN PTA GLASS AND THERE WAS

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.911
QUITE A BIG DIFFERENTIAL

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:12.646
BETWEEN PAINTING GLASS COULD

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:16.584
YOU- JUST WALK US THROUGH WHAT

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:20.755
THE DIFFERENCE. YOU MIGHT BE

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:21.589
I'M NOT SURE THERE'S TWO

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:23.290
DIFFERENT SIDES THAT COULD BE

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.659
IT COULD BE THAT I'M THE- SLIDE

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:27.695
NUMBER THREE THE CUMULATIVE

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:28.262
SHORTFALLS TO THE REDEMPTION

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.765
CENTERS. AND WHERE THERE IS

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.233
THERE ARE TWO LINES AND ONE OF

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.101
THEM WAS LABELED PT AND THE

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.336
OTHER ONE GLASS DOT ONE YEAH

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.371
AND- IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:38.939
PARTICULAR CHART WAS ON THE

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:40.241
UNDERPAYMENTS TO THE REDEMPTION

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.276
CENTERS. AND MOST OF THE UNDER

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.477
PAYMENTS ARE A RESULT OF THE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.746
GAP BETWEEN PT PRICES AND

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.416
EXPECTED PT PRICES- GLASSES A

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.251
MUCH SMALLER PLAYER AND THAT SO

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:51.385
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT CHART I

01:34:51.452 --> 01:34:52.753
CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION ON THE

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.388
CORRECT CHARTED A DOT THAT IS

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:55.356
RETURNS TO BE SO BASICALLY WHAT

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:58.492
YOU'RE SAYING IS. THAT IS IT

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.528
BECAUSE- GLASS IS A VERY SMALL

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:03.230
AMOUNT OF SO WE STREAM RELATIVE

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:06.233
TO PT. OR IS IT THAT. CLASS

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.936
PRICES. HAVE HELD UP RELATIVE

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:11.906
TO. THEIR THEIR THEIR RECYCLING

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.875
VALUE AND THEN INTO THE PT'S

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.745
PRICING HASN'T REALLY. HELD UP

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.747
WE HEARD SUPERVISOR- VALERIE

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:22.316
KIND OF TALK ABOUT IF THE PT

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:24.452
PRICES ACTUALLY WHAT. WAS NOTED

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:27.922
IN IN IN THE REPORT THAT THEY

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:32.793
IN FACT WOULD BE WOULD BE FINE.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.794
THE ANSWER IS BOTH YOU'RE

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:35.362
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON BOTH

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:37.698
FRONTS- GLASS IS A SMALLER

01:35:37.765 --> 01:35:39.733
PORTION THE NUMBER OF UNITS YOU

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.869
KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF UNITS

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:42.503
THAT ARE GLASSES IS WELL UNDER

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.738
THIRD. PT IS THE DOMINANT

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.340
CATEGORY IN THE BEVERAGE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.476
CONTAINER PROGRAM MORE THAN 50%

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:51.278
OF THE UNITS SOLD OR PT SO THAT

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:52.413
FIRST THING IS RIGHT THERE'S

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.381
MORE PT IN THE SYSTEM BUT THEN

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:56.217
THE P. ET PRICES ARE SO MUCH

01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:58.319
HIGHER LIKE LAST CELLS FOR. IN

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.688
THE RANGE OF ZERO DOLLARS A TEN

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:01.222
TO TWENTY DOLLARS A TONNE

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.290
WORRIES PT IS IN THE HUNDREDS

DECLINES IN THE PT PRICES SO

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.834
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THREE

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.503
THINGS MULTIPLIED TOGETHER

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.571

GO TO OREGON AND- OBSERVED

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:19.867
THERE. REALLY IMPRESSIVE BOTTLE

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:20.501
REDEMPTION PROGRAM WHICH IS YOU

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:23.571
KNOW- THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING AND

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:26.006
I COULD CERTAINLY SEE. HOW IT

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:27.174
WOULD BE VERY- HELPFUL AND

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.576
CONVENIENT TO CONSUMERS AND I

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:29.543
SAY THAT IS SOMEBODY THAT

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.111
LITERALLY HAS ABOUT EIGHT BOXES

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:32.546
BIG BOXES OF GLASS RIGHT NOW

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.081
SITTING ON MY PATIO EXCEPT TO

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:35.049
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:36.650
IT. TO REDEMPTION CENTER

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.319
BECAUSE I KNOW IF I PUT MY

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:40.087
TRASH IT'LL TURN INTO

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:40.955
CONTAMINATION AND I WANT TO DO

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:43.057
THE RIGHT THING. SO I HAVE A

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:45.092
COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST I WANTED

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:45.960
TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.661
THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHAT DO

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:48.529
YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.531
WE SHOULD LOOK AT SERIOUSLY IN

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:51.332
CALIFORNIA OR JOINING THEIR

01:37:51.398 --> 01:37:53.934
PROGRAM. AND SECONDLY I KNOW

01:37:54.001 --> 01:37:55.002
THAT THE BOTTLE BILL IS VERY

01:37:55.069 --> 01:37:56.503
COMPLICATED BUT IF THERE'S ANY

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.138
SIMPLE FIXES YOU YOU WOULD THAT

01:37:58.205 --> 01:37:59.373
YOU SAVE YOURSELF GOSH THIS

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.441
WOULD BE SO EASY WHY DON'T THE

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:03.510
JUST DO THIS OR THAT. IF YOU

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:05.079
HAD ANY. THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU

01:38:05.145 --> 01:38:07.481
KNOW. EASY FOR THINGS WE COULD

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:10.985
DO TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:11.585
THAT'S MY FRIEND THAT I HAVE A

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:16.657
FEW OTHER QUESTIONS. GREAT SO A

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.492
GREAT QUESTION ABOUT OR AGAIN-

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.194
I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:22.663
ABOUT THE PROGRAM IN OREGON. IT

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:25.399
IT OFFERS SO MANY CONVENIENCES

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:26.267
TO CONSUMERS THROUGH THE

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.534
VARIOUS WAYS THAT YOU CAN

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.370
RETURN CONTAINERS TO THE- TO

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:30.704
THE STORES OR THROUGH THEIR

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:33.507
BACKDROP PROGRAM. OR THROUGH

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.708
THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:36.510
THEY'VE BUILT THEY'VE- DONE THE

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.978
RIGHT THING WITH INCREASING THE

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:40.047
DEPOSIT VALUE FROM FIVE CENTS

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.649
TO TEN CENTS. AND WHEN THEY DID

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:43.450
THAT THEIR REDEMPTION RATE

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:47.054
INCREASED FROM 64% 286% TO THE

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.822
SITE 22% INCREASE IN THE

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:51.091
RETENTION RATE. AND THAT'S IT

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:52.760
THAT'S A WORLD CLASS CONCEPT

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:55.095
THAT THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED- DO SO

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.397
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS ABOUT IT

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:57.364
THEY'VE ALSO EXPANDED TO

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.832
DIFFERENT MATERIAL TIRED. YES

01:38:58.899 --> 01:38:59.900
DIFFERENT MATERIAL TYPES AND

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.602
IFFERENT COVERAGE TYPES. AND

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:02.836
THEY'RE DISCUSSING THE

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:05.005
POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDING ALSO

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.640
TO AND WINE AND SPIRITS

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:08.142
ESPECIALLY SINCE. I MENTIONED

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.910
THOSE HARD SELTZER CONTAINERS

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.745
DOES SEEM TO BE COMING THROUGH

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:15.783
OUR SYSTEMS ANYWAY- SO. OREGON

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:17.618
IS GREAT AND THERE'S A LOT TO

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.620
LEARN FROM IT IT'S AND IT'S ONE

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.088
OF AT LEAST THE TOP TWO

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:23.090
PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:25.125
IF NOT THE BEST ONE RIGHT NOW.

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:25.726
ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.695
LEVELS. AND I THINK I'VE GOT

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.563
MYSELF OFF TRACK- I KNOW THAT

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.564
THE SECOND QUESTION THAT YOU

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:33.133
ASKED WAS ABOUT AN EASY FIXES.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:34.835
HI I'M AFRAID NOT AND IF THERE

01:39:34.902 --> 01:39:36.337
WERE EASY FIXES THAT COULD HAVE

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:37.471
BEEN MADE TO THE CONTAINER

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.006
DEPOSIT LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:40.207
THEY PROBABLY ALREADY WOULD

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:41.942
HAVE AND SORRY TO BE YOU KNOW

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.644
TO GIVE A DISAPPOINTING ANSWER.

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:45.546
AND IT THE PROGRAM IT NEEDS

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:48.048
WHOLESALE CHANGES AND THERE ARE

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.016
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:50.818
WRONG WITH THE PROGRAM THAT ARE

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:52.553
REALLY REALLY LARGE ISSUES THAT

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.587
REALLY NEED TO BE TACKLED

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:54.755
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:56.623
VERY HOPEFUL RESPONSE AND IT IT

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.459
WILL HELP TO GUIDE. I THINK THE

01:39:58.525 --> 01:39:59.193
WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND HOW

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:01.495
WE LOOK AT VARIOUS OTHER PIECES

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:04.365
OF LEGISLATION. I'M SO. THIS

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:05.799
AGREES QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASK

01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:06.867
FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO ANSWER

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.335
SO. IF YOU THINK THIS ISN'T THE

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:09.570
RIGHT QUESTION IF YOU JUST PASS

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:11.739
AND MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE. ON THE

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:13.374
PANEL WANT TO ANSWER IT. SO WE

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:15.409
DEFINITELY HAVE ISSUES WITH

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:16.744
CONTAMINATION IN THE WASTE

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:20.881
STREAM- AND- I'M WONDERING.

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.516
WHAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:24.385
LOOKING AT TO REDUCE AT THAT

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:27.554
LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION- I KNOW

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:28.555
THAT YOU KNOW IT IT IS THAT IS

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.958
THE- PROBLEM REALLY. AT THE

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:32.393
BEEN LEVEL SHOULD WE BE GIVING

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:34.661
PEOPLE FOR BINS TO SORT THEIR

01:40:34.728 --> 01:40:37.464
TRASH. OR SHOULD WE BE TRYING

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.466
TO FOCUS MORE ON REDUCING THE

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:40.300
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIAL

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:41.468
THAT ARE IN THE RE STREAM. IF

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:42.703
YOU HAD YOUR DRUTHERS OR IS IT

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:45.439
BOTH- WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK WE

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:45.906
SHOULD BE DOING ABOUT

01:40:45.973 --> 01:40:56.250
CONTAMINATION. HOW DID YOU HEAR

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:56.850

INTO THE CLASSROOM THAT'S WHAT

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.719
WE'VE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL.

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.354
THE CHILDREN ARE THE ONES THAT

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:35.389
TEACH THE PARENTS HOW TO

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:37.491
RECYCLE THAT'S HOW WE STARTED

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:40.093
THE PROGRAM. IN THE TRI CITIES

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.729
FREMONT NEWARK UNION CITY AND

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:45.999
HAYWARD. INITIALLY MORE PICKED

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:48.135
UP RECYCLING BACK IN THE EIGHTY

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:51.939

TO GET INTO THE HOUSEHOLD- THE

01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:55.909
CHILDREN AND I THINK WE'VE LOST

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:57.644
THAT CONTINUITY BECAUSE OUR

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:58.645
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.481
INUNDATED WITH WORK OUR

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.383
TEACHERS ARE ALSO OVERWHELMED.

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:06.353
WITH DEMANDS ON TESTING BUT

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.021
THAT IS THE BEST METHODOLOGY

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:10.657
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED LET ME

01:42:10.724 --> 01:42:12.226
SAY ONE MORE THING ON THE

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:17.030
DEPOSIT. FROM A NICKEL TO A

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:19.833
DIME. I AGREE WITH CALL. BUT

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.669
HERE A VERY- AT THE I. WE ARE

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:25.706
PAYING OUT ON AVERAGE- PR WEEK

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:27.608
FIVE DAYS A WEEK BASED ON

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:30.177
CURRENT MARKET PRICES. IN CASH

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.979
TO OUR CUSTOMER FLOW BECAUSE

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:32.646
WE'RE SO INUNDATED WITH

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:36.116
CUSTOMERS. IN EXCESS OF ONE

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:38.519
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:40.721
WEEK IN CASH. AND THAT THAT

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:43.056
ABOUT FIVE CENTS PER CONTAINER.

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:45.292
IF WE DOUBLE THAT TO A DEADLINE

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.027
OUR CASH FLOW WILL HAVE TO GO

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:50.297
TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:53.200
DOLLARS. PER WEEK. THERE IS A

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:55.002
PROBLEM WITH CAL RECYCLES

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:57.037
PAYMENT. WITH THE GUARDS WHO

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:59.339
ARE RECEIVING OUR HANDLING FEES

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.742
AND REIMBURSEMENTS. SO WE HAVE

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:02.643
TO VERY CAREFULLY DO THE

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.878
CALCULATION ABOUT WHO CAN

RATE PAYERS. ABOUT IT YOU KNOW

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:52.185

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:53.754
YOU KNOW WE CAN TRY TO. FOLLOW

FIGURE THAT OUT I DID I'M SORRY

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.958
NICOLE. I WANT TO BURKE I WANT

01:44:58.025 --> 01:44:59.026
TO CLARIFY I'M NOT TALKING

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:01.061
ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION. IN

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.729
TERMS OF PEOPLE BEING OUT.

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:03.930
HAVING TO PICK BACKS UP OFF THE

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:05.666
STREET. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:08.769
ARE WE PAYING. APPROXIMATELY TO

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:10.203
DEAL WITH EITHER TRYING TO

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:12.472
RECYCLE PLASTIC OR DEAL WITH IN

01:45:12.539 --> 01:45:14.474
OUR LANDFILL. IS THERE ANY WAY

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:16.076
TH. I GUESS IT WOULD BE YOU

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:19.146
KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:19.846
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THE

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:21.481
SOMEHOW THE COST OF THIS

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:22.949
PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND IT IS A

01:45:23.016 --> 01:45:25.052
PRODUCT THAT'S BEING SOLD. TO

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.820
CONSUMERS AND PUT INTO OUR

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:28.588
ENVIRONMENT. BUT THERE NEEDS TO

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:31.158
BE A WAY OF MONETIZING. THE

01:45:31.224 --> 01:45:33.727
COST THAT RATE PAYERS. AND

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:35.729
TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS.

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:37.864
BECAUSE EVERY TIME. WE IN THE

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:41.268
LEGISLATURE. TRY TO PASS A BILL

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:42.269
DEALING WITH PLASTIC INCLUDING

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:44.071
LAST YEAR'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:46.807
BILLS. SB FIFTY FOUR IN AB TEN

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.809
EIGHTY. WHAT WE HEAR BACK FROM

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:51.712
INDUSTRY AND FROM- THE CHAMBER

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:52.979
OF COMMERCE AND OTHERS IS ALL

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.948
ABOUT COST WHAT THIS WOULD COST

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:56.817
TO CONSUMERS. AND WE DON'T SEEM

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:58.652
TO HAVE READILY ANY DATA ON THE

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.687
OTHER SIDE TO SHOW. THE

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:03.457
FINANCIAL COST. OF DEALING WITH

01:46:03.523 --> 01:46:04.658
THE POLLUTION YES BUT ALSO

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.660
WITH. JUST DISPOSING OF THE

01:46:06.727 --> 01:46:09.196
MATERIAL. SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.530
ALL TO ANSWER BUT I THINK THAT

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:11.331
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE START TO

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.833
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:14.134
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:14.968
STATE WHETHER THEY HAVE THE

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:17.304
ABILITY. TO PAY OR NOT WHETHER

01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:18.271
THEY'RE PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:19.573
NOT. BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:22.509
TREMENDOUS COST OF THE COST OF

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:25.445
THE CITIES AS WELL. YES I

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:26.980
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:27.981
AND I DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.950
NUMBER OUT BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:32.219
SEEN AN INCREASE IN RATES. I

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:34.554
KNOW WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT-

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:37.357
THE CLOSURE OF MARKETS FOR

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:37.991
THREE THREE SEVEN PLASTICS

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.293
RIGHT THESE. THESE LOW GRADE

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.762
CLASS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:44.564
HAVE- MUCH RECYCLING VALUE. WE

01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:45.565
KNOW THAT WHEN THOSE MARKETS

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:49.002
CLOSED OFF RATE INCREASED FOR

01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:50.337
CONSUMERS AND GENERATORS

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:51.705
RECYCLING- COSTS THAT SHOULD

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:54.007
SAY INCREASE. AROUND THE STATE

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.243
AS A RESULT OF THAT SO I THINK.

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.844
YOU KNOW THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:59.146
ADDRESSED FARTHER UPSTREAM

01:46:59.212 --> 01:47:00.313
RIGHT WE DON'T THERE IS NO

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.048
MARKET THE THREE THREE SEVEN

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:05.786
CLASSICS WHY IS THAT- MAYBE WE

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.154
SHOULD FOCUS ON MOVING AWAY

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:08.722
FROM THOSE CLASSICS AND THAT IS

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:10.657
IN PART OF MONICA MENTIONED.

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:13.760
WHAT THE CONNECTION THAT

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.362
ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN SET UP

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:16.830
TO THE BILL LAST YEAR IS

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.632
DEALING- AND THAT'S FROM THE

01:47:18.698 --> 01:47:20.200
COMMISSION. IN THE RICHER BY A

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:21.434
IS ON THAT COMMISSION WITH

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:24.037
WHILE ALSO TRYING TO IDENTIFY.

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:26.339
WHAT THE MATERIAL WHAT PRODUCT

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:28.975
ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE WHAT'S

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:29.943
WHAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:31.711
RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:33.313
STATEWIDE A LOT OF THAT IS

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.849
DEPENDENT ON- WHAT THE MARKETS

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:37.384
ARE. FOR THAT AND WHETHER THEY

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:39.052
CAN BE REUSED AND CAN BE

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.188
RECYCLED INTO NEW PRODUCT. AND

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:42.756
THEN TRYING TO SHIFT AWAY FROM

01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:49.496
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT DON'T.

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:50.730
HAVE- TELL YOU. I KNOW THAT

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:53.066
YEAH KNOW THAT'S- AND ACTUALLY-

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:53.800
SAY THAT THERE IS A CORAL. WITH

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:54.901
THE WITH THE MATERIALS AND

01:47:54.968 --> 01:47:56.870
COSTS FOR CONSUMERS IS. A

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:57.904
REALLY INTERESTING HERE AND

01:47:57.971 --> 01:47:58.805
SOMETHING THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.674
MORE ABOUT AT SOME POINT. AND I

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.875
WILL GO BACK YOU YOU REFERRED

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.677
TO MS ADMINS COMMENTS US

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:04.411
SENATOR EGGMAN SOON TO BE

01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:05.946
SENATOR EGGMAN COMMENTS. AND I

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:07.380
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH HER THIS

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:08.582
IS NOT ABOUT BLAMING-

01:48:08.648 --> 01:48:11.051
INDIVIDUALS- REPAIRS CONSUMERS

01:48:11.117 --> 01:48:13.019
IN FACT. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:14.821
WE SPENT YEARS BLAMING THEM FOR

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:17.023
PLASTIC POLLUTION FOR. LACK OF

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:19.359
RECYCLING FOR CONTAMINATION NOW

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:20.293
AND NONE OF THAT'S THEIR FAULT

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.361
THEY'RE RECYCLING BECAUSE THEY

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:22.429
WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING YOU

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:23.563
KNOW THE THAT THEY THROW

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:24.631
EVERYTHING IN THE BIN EVEN

01:48:24.698 --> 01:48:25.899
THAT'S IF IT'S NOT RECYCLABLE

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:27.133
SPEECH SHOWS THAT THEY REALLY

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.369
WANT. TO BE GOOD STEWARDS AND

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:32.505
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:33.039
WANT THESE PRODUCTS TO BE

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:33.607
RECYCLED. AND THE TRUTH IS

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:35.008
THERE NOT AND THE ONES WHO ARE.

01:48:35.075 --> 01:48:36.509
PAYING THE BURDEN OF THAT ARE

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:37.744
THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE THE

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:38.478
PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO DO

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:39.713
THE RIGHT THING. ARE PAYING

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.748
MORE THAN UTILITY BILL. THEY'RE

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:42.816
BEING BLAMED FOR PLASTIC

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:45.886
POLLUTION. AND I DON'T THINK

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:46.887
THAT IT'S AN ACCIDENT I THINK

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:48.321
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT'S-

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.056
KIND OF BEEN DONE. OVER THE

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:52.859
YEARS SAID TO THEM. AND WE YOU

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:54.561
KNOW WE NEED TO BE THE ONES TO.

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:55.528
TO SORT OF STOP THAT AND

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:56.997
RECLAIM THAT AND PUT THE BURDEN

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.164
FINANCIAL BURDEN AND BLAME

01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:59.599
BURDEN WHERE IT BELONGS WHICH

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:01.201
IS ON THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY IN

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:03.403
THESE MANUFACTURERS. NOW THAT'S

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.304
NOT TO SAY THAT A LOT OF THEM

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:05.138
AREN'T REALLY DOING THE RIGHT

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:06.106
THING AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:49:06.172 --> 01:49:07.007
HEAR FROM THE STRAWBERRY PEOPLE

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.008
A LITTLE LATER AND THEY'VE BEEN

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.142
DOING INCREDIBLE WORK AND

01:49:09.209 --> 01:49:10.110
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:11.978
ARE. TAKING SOURCE PRODUCTION

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:13.813
VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE SHOULD.

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.148
YOU KNOW IT KNOWLEDGE AND

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:16.449
CELEBRATE THAT TO ENCOURAGE

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:18.551
THEM- AND SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:20.553
TO SO. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.788
NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:24.557
KIND OF AS A SOCIETY- WHAT THE

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:26.359
IMPACTS ARE WHICH IS WHY. WE'RE

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:28.428
HAVING THIS HEARING SO THANK

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:29.596

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:16.629
DEVELOPMENT ON THE GROUND AND

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:17.797
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:20.166
FACING THE REGULATORY ISSUES-

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:21.901
ARE ARE ARE VERY DIFFICULT WHEN

01:52:21.968 --> 01:52:23.269
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:24.337
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NON

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:26.272
ATTAINMENT AREAS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:27.407
WHERE WE HAVE TO MEET VERY

01:52:27.474 --> 01:52:29.809
STRICT- EMISSION REQUIREMENTS

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:30.710
WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING EVEN A

01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:32.812
COMPOST FACILITY YOU KNOW IT'S

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:33.446
VERY EASY FOR US TO THINK OF

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:35.882
COMPOST IS THIS WONDERFUL GREEN

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:37.417
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT REALLY IS

01:52:37.484 --> 01:52:39.052
BUT WITHOUT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:52:39.119 --> 01:52:40.920
COMES ITS OWN EMISSIONS AND

01:52:40.987 --> 01:52:42.422
ISSUES ANY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:43.857
BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE NEW SOURCE

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.792
EMISSION CALIFORNIA YOU'RE

LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES IN NOT

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:51.898
SO REALLY IT'S SLOW RIGHT NOW

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:53.733

HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND TO

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.941
UNDERSTAND THAT ESPECIALLY IN

01:53:02.008 --> 01:53:03.943
THE REFUSE INDUSTRY. WE ARE

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:05.278
TRYING TO MANAGE THIS MATERIAL

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:06.045
THE ORGANIC WAY SO WE'RE

01:53:06.112 --> 01:53:08.681
TALKING ABOUT IS FOR MORE AT IF

THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER WALL

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:10.917
VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM IS A

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.318
MILLION TIMES A YEAR WE'RE

01:53:12.385 --> 01:53:14.687
TALKING ABOUT TWENTY SIX TWENTY

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:15.922
SEVEN MILLION TONS OF ORGANIC

01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:17.557
WASTE THAT IS EMITTING METHANE

01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:19.025
IN OUR LANDFILLS THIS IS JUST A

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:21.394
HUGE ENORMOUS LEFT- THAT IS

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.029
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.597
TO MEET OUR CLIMATE RDUCTION

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:28.101

BILL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURES

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:32.272
GETTING YOU KNOW GETTING OFF

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:34.607
THE GROUND BUT IT'S NOT AND OUR

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:36.242
COMMUNITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:37.310
MEETING THESE OBLIGATIONS

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:39.946
JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:41.247
MEANING ALL ORGANICS ARE

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:45.618
COLLECTED FROM BOTH.

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:46.085
RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:47.053
GENERATORS. I HOPE THAT WAS

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.121
HELPFUL. YEAH SO IT IS A BE

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:49.656
LIKE WE'RE TALK ABOUT RECYCLING

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:52.792
WORSE. AND MY HOUSE AS WELL WE

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:54.594
ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION BLUE

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.529
BAND AND IN OUR HEAD IT'S

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.798
RECYCLED SO. IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:53:58.865 --> 01:53:59.566
TWO ARE GOING TO HAVE THE

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:01.401
ORGANICS BEEN FILLED UP AND

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.336
THEN NOT HAVE A PROPER PLACE

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:06.172
TO. DISPOSE OF IT. EXACTLY IS

01:54:06.239 --> 01:54:07.140
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:08.341
MATERIAL GO I MEAN WE USE A

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:10.643
SANITARY LANDFILL FOR A REASON

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:11.978
RIGHT I MEAN AND I UNDERSTAND

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:13.313
LANDFILLS WE DON'T WANT METHANE

01:54:13.379 --> 01:54:14.414
EMITTING THAT WE HAVE THESE

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.382
LANDFILLS ARE MANAGEMENT. IT'S

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:18.117
HOW WE MANAGE THIS MATERIAL

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.485
RIGHT AND SO FOR GONNA MOVE IT

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:21.754
OUT OF THE LANDFILL- WE NEED TO

01:54:21.821 --> 01:54:23.189
HAVE A PLACE TO PUT IT AND THAT

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:25.158
IS IT EITHER A COMPOST FACILITY

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:26.926
OR ANAEROBIC DIGESTION FACILITY

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:27.927
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO MORE

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:29.362
FEEDSTOCKS WE CAN TALK ABOUT

AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

01:54:34.267 --> 01:54:36.102
APPLICATIONS BUT THE PRIMARY

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:37.537
MECHANISMS ARE COMPOSTING

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:39.272
ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. AND

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:40.807
COMPOSTING OBVIOUSLY IS MORE

01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:42.175
YOU KIND OF THINK ABOUT MORE IN

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:44.043

OPEN WIND ROSE AS YOU START TO

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.213
GET URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AGAIN

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.448
WITH THE EMISSION ISSUES YOU'RE

01:54:48.514 --> 01:54:50.016
GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE-

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:52.452
ENCLOSED INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:54.120
ADVANTAGE MOST ADVANCED BEST IN

01:54:54.187 --> 01:54:56.322
CLASS TECHNOLOGY WHICH REALLY

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.191
DOES COST MORE THIS IS NOT JUST

HOPING IT ALL GOES WELL THESE

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:03.930
ARE REALLY JUST ADVANCED

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:04.797
TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE AS

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:06.733
MATERIAL PRODUCES REALLY.

01:55:06.799 --> 01:55:08.434
IMPORTANT COMPOST OR IN THE

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:09.802
CASE OF BIOGAS AAEROBIC

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.337
DIGESTION WHICH IS MORE

01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:13.773
EXPENSIVE THAN COMPOST- AND SO

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:14.974
WE DO NEED TO MAKE THOSE

01:55:15.041 --> 01:55:16.142

FROM HOME CONTINUATION OF

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:11.350
REMOTE LEARNING SO JUST TRYING

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:12.185
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:14.253
LIKE FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.822

IN DOMESTIC RECYCLING CAPACITY

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:23.229
WE'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE TALK

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:24.263
ABOUT THAT ALREADY THIS MORNING

01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:26.165
THAT INVESTMENTS OCCURRING HERE

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:30.169
IN THE US WHICH. IS A GREAT

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:31.337
THING- YOU. AGAIN DEALING WITH

01:58:31.404 --> 01:58:33.005
THAT BIG. RESIDENTIAL

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:36.075
COMMERCIAL VOLUMES- INCREASE WE

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:37.877
SAW INCREASED DEMAND- FOR

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:39.145
CERTAIN GRADES OF MATERIALS AND

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:41.681
I CAN. I CAN SHARE THAT- DETAIL

01:58:41.747 --> 01:58:43.516
WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER-

AND THEN YOU KNOW AGAIN MIXED

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.652
SIGNALS ARE GOING INTO NEXT

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:48.721
YEAR SO. FIGURING OUT HOW TO

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:50.923
MANAGE- THE BUSINESS- IN THE

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:52.458
FACE OF UNCERTAINTY.

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:55.561
CHRISTENING SO JUST A FEW

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:57.730
EXAMPLES OF BEST PRACTICES- YOU

01:58:57.797 --> 01:58:58.731
CAN SEE A PHYSICAL BARRIER

01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:00.666
THERE TO THE LEFT- THAT'S

01:59:00.733 --> 01:59:02.635
PRETTY TYPICAL OF WHAT WE DID.

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.337
IN THE EARLY DAYS AT ALL OF OUR

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:07.106
RECYCLING FACILITIES- WEATHER'S

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:09.375
PLEXIGLASS PLEXIGLASS. I SHOWER

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:10.743
CURTAINS OR OTHER TYPES OF

01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:11.777
PHYSICAL BARRIERS WHERE WE

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:13.279
COULD NOT MAINTAIN A SIX FOOT

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:16.115
SEPARATION. AND THEN IN THIS-

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.149
IN THE RECYCLING LINE OF

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:18.751
BUSINESS YOU KNOW GENERALLY WE

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:20.953
WILL TAKE BREAKS ALL SAME TIME-

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:23.356
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:23.890
THIRTY FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE

01:59:23.956 --> 01:59:25.057
WORKING ON ONE OF THESE

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.859
LOCATIONS ON A SINGLE SHIFT. SO

01:59:26.926 --> 01:59:28.394
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:30.563
CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:33.266
FOR OUR EMPLOYEES- THE TENT ON

01:59:33.332 --> 01:59:34.600
THE RIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:38.070
MAX ON. SO JUST A SIMPLE

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:42.241
GRAPHIC- BIG BIG SWINGS IN

01:59:42.308 --> 01:59:46.045
VOLUME- ADDITIONALLY- COMING

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:47.780
OUT LATE MARCH AND EARLY APRIL

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:50.149
AGAIN THIS IS NATIONWIDE SAW AS

01:59:50.216 --> 01:59:52.718
MUCH AS A 30% DECREASE I IN OUR

01:59:52.785 --> 01:59:54.153
COMMERCIAL LINES AND A

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.955
COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND WE SAW

01:59:56.022 --> 01:59:58.658
AS MUCH AS A 25230% INCREASE IN

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:00.393
RESIDENTIAL BY HIM. AND YOU

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:03.029
KNOW SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

02:00:03.095 --> 02:00:07.500
CONTRACTS ARE. CONSTRUCTED-

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:08.701
MOST COMMERCIAL RATEPAYERS PAY

02:00:08.768 --> 02:00:10.336
BY THE YARD WHERE THEY PAY BY

02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:12.672
THE SERVICE- YOU KNOW WHETHER

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:14.473
IT'S THREE TIMES A WEEK- EVERY

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.776
DAY MOST ALMOST PAY BY THE

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:20.313
MONTH SO AS- VOLUMES SHIPPED.

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.248
BY AND AS WE KIND OF APPROACH

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.684
SOME NEW NORMAL- CONTINUATION

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.285
OF WORK FROM HOME. THEY WILL

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:27.987
PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE OVER

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:30.289
TIME ON ON THOSE HOMEOWNER

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:34.894
RATES. I'M EXCITED. SO JUST A

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:35.962
LITTLE BETTER TREND ANALYSIS

02:00:36.028 --> 02:00:38.230
HERE- THE GRAPHIC TO THE UPPER

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:39.899
RIGHT IS RESIDENTIAL VOLUMES

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.300
AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THAT PRETTY

02:00:41.367 --> 02:00:43.869
SIGNIFICANT UPTICK- MARCH AND

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:46.472
APRIL OFF OF THE BASELINE-

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:48.674
WE'VE SEEN THAT TREND DOWN AND

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:50.843
THAT'S THE BLUE LINE- THE L.

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:52.411
THE YELLOW LINE IS KIND OF OUR

02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:54.680
FORWARD LOOKING- PROJECTION

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:56.916
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE-

02:00:56.983 --> 02:00:59.418
FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES REMOTE

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:02.488
LEARNING WORK FROM HOME- SOME

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.323
OF THAT WILL NEVER GET BACK TO

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:07.093
NORMAL. ARE CONVERSELY ON THE

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:11.530
COMMERCIAL SIDE- STEEP DECLINE-

02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:16.435
AND AGAIN YOU SEE A TAIL OUT IN

02:01:16.502 --> 02:01:17.036
TWO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOME OF

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:20.006
THE SOME OF THE INDUSTRY THAT

02:01:20.072 --> 02:01:20.573
WE THINK WILL COME BACK THE

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.643
SLOWEST. OBVIOUSLY HOSPITALITY-

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:25.645
LEISURE- THOSE TYPES OF SPACES

02:01:25.711 --> 02:01:31.951
SO. OUR NEXT LOVE. SOME PRETTY

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:38.190
BIG SHIFTS ARE IN MATERIAL MIX-

02:01:38.257 --> 02:01:39.392
SO YOU KNOW I MENTION THE

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.127
VOLUME SHIFTING FROM COMMERCIAL

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:43.095
OVER TO RESIDENTIAL BUT YOU

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:44.430
THINK ABOUT AT HOME CONSUMPTIVE

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:49.335
BEHAVIOR- BIG INCREASE IN SMALL

02:01:49.402 --> 02:01:51.270
CARDBOARD BOXES- IN THE

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:52.838
RESIDENTIAL STREAM WE CALL THAT

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:55.141
THE AMAZON EFFECT- BUT DON'T

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:56.809
WANT TO EXCLUDE OTHER

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:59.278
E-COMMERCE. WORSE IN RECORD

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:00.946
AMOUNTS OF PT ALUMINUM AND

02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:03.516
GLASS- THAT'S ALL THAT THAT

02:02:03.582 --> 02:02:05.885
HOME CONSUMPTION. THAT OTHERS

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:08.954
HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- ON

02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:11.891
THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. BIG DROP

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:14.126
OFF IN THAT LARGE CARDBOARD

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:16.095
THAT WE'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO-

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:21.801
RETAIL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSING-

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:25.671
AND OBVIOUSLY- NOT ALL

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:27.573
COMMERCIAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.309
HURT THE SAME SO GROCERY AND

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:31.577
BIG BOX HOME IMPROVEMENT

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:33.946
ACTUALLY I'VE HAD A REALLY GOOD

02:02:34.013 --> 02:02:36.115
YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC SO-

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:37.349
MOST OF OUR COMMERCIAL LINES

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:40.352
OFF- SOME OF ITS UP. IN AN

02:02:40.419 --> 02:02:42.254
INDUSTRIAL WHICH THE MOST OF

02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:44.356
YOU WOULD CALL ROLL OFF- MOST

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:45.558
OF THE PERMANENT BUSINESS WAS

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:48.327
NOT IMPACTED- IN STATES

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.662
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA THAT

02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:51.397
CLOSED DOWN CONSTRUCTION.

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:52.732
OBVIOUSLY THOSE ROLL OFF

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:55.301
CONTAINERS- IN THE EARLY DAYS

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:55.735
WERE IMPACTED PRETTY

02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:59.238
SIGNIFICANTLY. BUT WE'VE SEEN

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.639
MOST OF THAT ACTIVITY COME BACK.

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:05.511
AN EXCELLENT. SO A LOT OF

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:08.013
DETAIL HERE- WE'VE ALREADY HAD

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.550
SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT CHINA-

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:15.287
HISTORICALLY- CHINA IMPORTED

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.355
ABOUT TWENTY MILLION TONNES OF

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.890
MATERIAL MOST THAT'S FIBER

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:20.659
BASED OR OR PAPER BASED- FROM

WE FULLY EXPECT THEM TO STEP

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.435
OUT OF THE MARKET- THERE'S

02:03:29.502 --> 02:03:30.636
INVESTMENT OCCURRING IN THE U.

02:03:30.703 --> 02:03:35.508
S. THE MAP THERE AS- AN EXAMPLE

02:03:35.574 --> 02:03:37.710
OF LARGE. PAPER MILL

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:39.678
INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:42.448
ANNOUNCED BUT AS YOU CAN SEE BY

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:43.849
WHERE THOSE OBJECTIVES

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:45.785
GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED THEY'RE

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:46.652
GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR

02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:48.954
CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:51.390
THOSE NEW PROJECTS. SOME DATA

HERE ON COMMODITY VALUES- I

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:58.030
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

DATE NINETY EIGHT AND THAT'S

02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:16.849
INDICATIVE OF AN IMPROVING

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:06.385
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ESSENTIAL

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:43.055
ITSELF THE PRICING CAME BACK

02:12:43.121 --> 02:12:44.589
TO. THE PLASTIC MARKET FELL

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:48.727
DRAMATICALLY IN THE. IN THE

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:49.227
FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE

02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:52.197
PANDEMIC. OVER 40% FOR PT WHICH

02:12:52.264 --> 02:12:53.732
IS THE BIGGEST COMMODITY THAT

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:57.669
WE HANDLE- AND THE MAIN REASON

02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.071
IT FAILS BECAUSE OF THE LOW OIL

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:01.640
PRICE. THE OIL PRICE YOU KNOW

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.675
WHEN OIL GETS TO BE A NEGATIVE

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:06.545
PRICE WAS FOR A HALF A DAY OR A

02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:08.146
DAY IT. WAS TRADING AT A

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:10.749
NEGATIVE. AT YOU CAN JUST SEE

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:13.719
THAT THE THAT'S THE SUBSTITUTE

02:13:13.785 --> 02:13:15.120
FOR RECYCLE PLASTIC IS THE

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:20.025
VIRGIN PLASTIC SO- SO IT

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:21.660
BECAUSE THE PLASTIC MARKETS TO

02:13:21.727 --> 02:13:23.562
CRATER. THEY HAVE RECOVERED

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:26.164
SOME SENSE IN THE LAST MONTH OR

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:28.166
TWO MOST OF THAT RECOVERY- IN

02:13:28.233 --> 02:13:32.437
MY ESTIMATION IS DUE TO THE- IS

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:35.374
DUE TO THE- MINIMUM CONTENT.

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.341
THAT WAS PASSED BY THE

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:37.509
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:39.177
THAT HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:41.813
THE MARKETS. FROM THE CLASS

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.749
PRICES REMAINED UNCHANGED AND

02:13:43.815 --> 02:13:45.484
IT LARGELY REMAINS UNCHANGED

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.986
YEAR OVER YEAR- HAVE THE MAIN

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.187
REASON IT NEVER REALLY CHANGES

02:13:49.254 --> 02:13:52.991
IS BECAUSE IT'S- IT'S- VIRGIN

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:56.628
SUBSTITUTE IS- SAND. WHICH

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:59.197
DOESN'T HAVE VERY MUCH VALUE SO-

02:13:59.264 --> 02:14:01.133
THE VOLUMES FOR GLASS WERE OFF

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.668
VOTE AROUND 5% AND THAT'S

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.170
PRIMARILY WITH THE RESTAURANTS

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:08.774
AND BARS BEING CLOSE. ALUMINUM

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.742
FELL. FOR THE FIRST THREE

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:13.678
MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC- IT WAS

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:16.047
MORE OF A- NATION WIDE FALLING

02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:17.516
ALUMINUM THERE WAS A SHORTAGE

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:19.284
AND ALUMINUM CANS BUT THERE WAS

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:20.986
A NATIONWIDE FALLING ALUMINUM

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:22.821
PRICING PRIMARILY TO THE AUTO

02:14:22.888 --> 02:14:25.056
INDUSTRY SLOWING DOWN THEY

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:26.992
CONSUME A LOT OF RECYCLING.

02:14:27.058 --> 02:14:31.029
AND- IT HAS RECOVERED SOME. IN

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:33.064
THE LAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS SO

02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:34.266
IT'S KID LOOKS LIKE IT'S

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:37.068
CONTINUING TO RECOVER. I'M I

02:14:37.135 --> 02:14:38.603
WANTED TO DELVE INTO THE EXPORT

02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.071
MARKETS JUST A LITTLE BIT I

02:14:40.138 --> 02:14:40.939
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:43.708
ABOUT HIM- AND THERE'S BEEN A

02:14:43.775 --> 02:14:45.544
LOT OF CHANGES IN THE EXPORT

02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:47.212
MARKET OVER THE PAST. YOU KNOW.

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:49.114
YOU'RE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:51.016
CHINA SHUTTING OFF RECYCLABLES.

02:14:51.082 --> 02:14:52.951
THAT'S A HUGE HUGE MARKET FOR

02:14:53.018 --> 02:14:55.520
US AND- A LOT OF THE OTHER

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.222
FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE PICKED UP

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:59.658
VOLUME AND CREATED PROCESSING

02:14:59.724 --> 02:15:01.359
TO HELP. CONSUME THE PRODUCT

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:02.661
THAT WOULD GO TO CHINA FOR THE

02:15:02.727 --> 02:15:04.262
FINISHED PRODUCT SO. THEY'RE

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:07.098
MAKING THE BOXES IS STILL THERE

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:07.666
JUST BEING MADE A DIFFERENT

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:10.302
COUNTRY- AS YOU GO COUNTRY BY

02:15:10.368 --> 02:15:12.170
COUNTRY YOU KNOW KOREA HAD

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:14.739
MAJOR IMPACTS YOU KNOW THEY HAD

02:15:14.806 --> 02:15:15.540
A LOCKDOWN FROM MARCH THROUGH

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:17.509
JUNE. BECAUSE HUGE SUPPLY

02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:20.812
DEMAND SWINGS AND- DIFFICULT

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:23.114
FOR THEM- THEY WERE AT IT

02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:26.117
BECAUSE PART OF THE SPIKE IN-

02:15:26.184 --> 02:15:37.329
OCC PRICE WAS DUE TO THAT. IN

02:15:37.395 --> 02:15:37.863
CHINA OF COURSE THEY SHUT

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:39.531
OFFERS. BUT THEY ARE HAD WHAT

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:40.832
DOWN ORDER. INDIA AXE CLOSE

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:41.766
REPORT FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS.

02:15:41.833 --> 02:15:42.968
BECAUSE OF PANDEMIC. THEY

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:44.936
DIDN'T HAVE ANY X. RAM FOR

02:15:45.003 --> 02:15:46.371
FIVE. V. SHUT DOWN THERE.

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:47.539
BECAUSE THE TOO MUCH OF ALL

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:48.139
COMING IN THE COUNTRY WEREN'T

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:50.475
ABLE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME-

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:51.743
THAILAND. SURPRISINGLY

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:53.378
INCREASED CONSUMPTION AND IS

02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:56.214
PUTTING CAPACITY TO HELP- OVER

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:59.184
THE LOSS IN CHINA- INDONESIA

02:15:59.251 --> 02:16:01.786
HAD STRICT LOCKDOWN- ORDERS AND

02:16:01.853 --> 02:16:03.788
THEY HAD A FREEZE ON IMPORTS

02:16:03.855 --> 02:16:07.492
FOR ABOUT FORTY DAYS- SO THE

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:10.262
EACH MARKET IS INDIVIDUAL AND

02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:11.496
THE COMMODITIES THAT WE THE

02:16:11.563 --> 02:16:13.732
OWNER ARE TRADED WORLDWIDE. AND

02:16:13.798 --> 02:16:14.900
I JUST WANTED YOU KNOW IMPOSE

ON YOU THAT IT'S THAT YOU KNOW

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:17.903
CALIFORNIA CAN DO SOME THINGS

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.838
TO HELP THE MARKETS BUT-

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:20.772
THEY'RE ALSO THERE'S A

02:16:20.839 --> 02:16:22.607
WORLDWIDE FACTORS THAT

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:26.311
CALIFORNIA CAN'T REALLY- IT'LL

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:28.446
CHANGE- THE LAST THING I WANTED

02:16:28.513 --> 02:16:30.582

CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A BIG

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:34.252
CONGESTION AT THE PORTS THE

PORCH AT A CRITICAL POINT TO

AND NOW TURN SLIDE. YEAH- THE

02:29:07.571 --> 02:29:10.708
CURRENT CLAM SHELL SO. FOR JUST

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:12.276
OVER TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:14.178
USING THE PLASTIC CLAM CHOWDER

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:16.681
CLAM SHELL IN IN STRAWBERRIES

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:19.216
AND- IN THE OTHER BIRDS AS WELL

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:21.686
AND YEAH WE REALLY BENEFITTED

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.654
FROM THE RECYCLING GOING ON IN

02:29:23.721 --> 02:29:25.189
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:27.692
THAT CLAM SHELL- HAS TYPICALLY

02:29:27.758 --> 02:29:29.727
CONTAIN THE MOST AMOUNT OF

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:32.463
CALIFORNIA RECYCLE CONTENT OF

02:29:32.530 --> 02:29:33.331
ANY FOOD PACKAGE IN THE UNITED

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:37.134
STATES. AND SO FOR MANY YEARS-

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:38.336
WE THOUGHT HEY WE'RE DOING A

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:40.838
PRETTY GOOD JOB BUT OF COURSE

02:29:40.905 --> 02:29:42.907
IT'S NOT YOU KNOW AFTER WE'VE

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.709
RECYCLED THE BOTTLES INTO THE

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.177
CLAM SHELL THEN WHERE DOES THE

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:47.311
CLAM SHELL GO AND SO WE

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:50.514
RECOGNIZE THAT'S THAT'S A

02:29:50.581 --> 02:29:51.382
PROBLEM THAT HAS TO BE SOLVED.

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:54.418
SO THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW WHO

02:29:54.485 --> 02:29:56.620
WE STARTED LIKE I DESCRIBED-

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:57.621
COORDINATING WITH OTHER

02:29:57.688 --> 02:29:59.523
ORGANIZATIONS AND IN DIFFERENT

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:01.125
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS

02:30:01.192 --> 02:30:03.461
OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:05.329
RECYCLING SUPPLY CHAIN. WE

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:07.631
STARTED TESTING- ALTERNATIVE

02:30:07.698 --> 02:30:09.567
PRODUCTS ALTERNATE MATERIALS

02:30:09.633 --> 02:30:12.069
FIBER CARDBOARD YEAH- THE IMAGE

02:30:12.136 --> 02:30:15.239
THAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT IS-

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:19.243
CARDBOARD AT. CALLED TRAYS- AND

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:20.945
THEN WITHIN THAT ARE CARDBOARD

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:23.080
CLAM SHELLS INSTEAD OF PLASTIC

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:26.183
CLAM SHELLS. OUT ITS COLLAPSE

02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:28.986
THERE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS

02:30:29.053 --> 02:30:31.589
THE MOISTURE IN THE BERRIES WAS

02:30:31.655 --> 02:30:34.291
ABSORBED BY THE CARDBOARD CLAM

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:36.794
SHELL. THAT THEN TRANSFERRED IT

02:30:36.861 --> 02:30:38.496
INTO THE TRAY THAT THAT

02:30:38.562 --> 02:30:40.598
PROVIDES THE STRUCTURE SO THAT

02:30:40.664 --> 02:30:41.332
YOU KNOW THE FREE DOESN'T GET

02:30:41.399 --> 02:30:44.869
SQUISHED AND YOU CAN SEE IF IT

02:30:44.935 --> 02:30:47.271
COLLAPSED. AL BUT I'LL SAY THAT

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:49.573
PICTURE IS IN OUR VIEW AN

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:51.409
EXAMPLE OF SUCCESS IN THE SENSE

02:30:51.475 --> 02:30:53.844
OF PROGRESS YEAH BECAUSE WE'RE

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.546
STILL WORKING WITH FIBER RIGHT

02:30:55.613 --> 02:30:56.280
SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT

02:30:56.347 --> 02:30:58.282
WE'RE DOING. IN TERMS OF

02:30:58.349 --> 02:31:00.885
PLASTIC BUT OUR WORK IN FIBER

02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:02.820
AND IT'S NOT JUST OUR WORK THE

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:04.054
WORK OF MANY PACKAGING

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:06.424
COMPANIES IN IN FIBER IS STILL

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:09.427
GOING ON SO- SO WE LOOK AT LIKE

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:11.896
SAID THAT AS AN EXAMPLE OF A

02:31:11.962 --> 02:31:13.898
PROGRESS AND- AND I WOULD

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:16.467
EXPECT TO SEE. NICHE%

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:18.803
OPPORTUNITIES- WOULDN'T AMOUNT

02:31:18.869 --> 02:31:22.339
TO A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:31:22.406 --> 02:31:23.240
TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE.

02:31:23.307 --> 02:31:26.043
BECAUSE THAT PLASTIC SHELL-

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:29.580
ACHIEVE SO MANY OTHER-

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:31.615
STANDARDS AND I IN PARTICULAR

02:31:31.682 --> 02:31:34.251
IF WE THINK OF FOOD SAFETY ALSO

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:36.821
IF WE THINK OF FOOD WASTE- THE

02:31:36.887 --> 02:31:38.055
CLAM SHELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:40.224
ABSORBING THE MOISTURE OUT WE

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:42.426
GET A LONGER SHELF LIFE IN THE

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:44.995
FRUIT M. AND SO WE REDUCED OF

02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:47.498
THE FOOD WASTE. ALSO BECAUSE

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:49.700
IT'S VERY VERY LIGHT YOU TALKED

02:31:49.767 --> 02:31:51.235
ABOUT WASTE REDUCTION I MEAN

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:52.736
YOU KNOW THESE CLAM SHELLS HAVE

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:54.505
BEEN OPTIMIZED TO DOWN TO THE

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:59.743
GRAHAM- IN TERMS OF. ACHIEVING

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:02.413
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PLASTIC TO

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:04.415
DO ITS JOB. ANDPART OF THAT

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:06.083
ALSO IS TO BE LIGHT WEIGHT SO

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:07.785
THAT FOR SHIPPING IT REDUCES

02:32:07.852 --> 02:32:10.955
ENERGY COSTS- FOR SHIPPING SO.

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:13.958
LOTS OF BENEFICIAL PURPOSES TO

02:32:14.024 --> 02:32:16.093
THAT CURRENT CLAM SHELL. BUT IN

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:19.263
ORDER TO IMPROVE IT- THE ONE

02:32:19.330 --> 02:32:20.998
BARRIER THAT WE IMMEDIATELY

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:23.834
SIZE THAT WE USE OUR PAPER AND-

02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:26.036
ON THE LABEL. AND WHILE THERE

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:27.505
CAN BE RECYCLED IT IT

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:29.306
DEFINITELY CAUSES A CHALLENGE

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:32.076
AND CAN GUM UP THE SYSTEM THERE

02:32:32.142 --> 02:32:33.310
AND- IT WITH THE RECYCLERS AS

02:32:33.377 --> 02:32:34.912
THEY TRY AND WASH OUT OFTEN THE

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:38.482
GLUE. AND SO THE- THE STANDARD-

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:40.851
THAT WE FOUND- WAS TO SWITCH TO

02:32:40.918 --> 02:32:43.087
A B. O. P. P. LABEL- SAME TYPE

02:32:43.153 --> 02:32:45.022
A LABEL THAT YOU SEE ON THOSE-

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:47.258
BEVERAGE BOTTLES- THAT'S ALSO

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:48.792
MADE OUT OF PLASTIC SO THAT THE

02:32:48.859 --> 02:32:52.062
LABEL CAN BE RECYCLED ITSELF AS

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:53.864
WELL. AND AND SO IN FEBRUARY WE

02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:55.232
MADE THE COMMITMENT AS THE

02:32:55.299 --> 02:32:58.335
INDUSTRY TO SWITCH A 100% OF

02:32:58.402 --> 02:33:00.137
THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO THAT B. O.

02:33:00.204 --> 02:33:02.473
P. P. LABEL. AND WE'RE TALKING

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:04.608
JUST A LITTLE TINY BIT OF

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:06.710
MATERIAL THERE BUT- IT WAS

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:10.080
SURPRISING. JUST AS A INDUSTRY

02:33:10.147 --> 02:33:12.283
SWITCH- WE SAW THE- PRICE

02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:15.219
GOUGING OCCURRING- 90% HIGHER

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:17.454
THAN WHAT IT SHOULD BE- IT

02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:18.956
QUICKLY SETTLED OUT IN PART

02:33:19.023 --> 02:33:20.457
BECAUSE THERE'S A HEALTHY-

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:22.526
MARKETPLACE OF SUPPLIERS M.

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:24.728
BECAUSE- WE- PART OF OUR WHOLE

02:33:24.795 --> 02:33:26.931
REASON FOR COORDINATING AS- THE

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:29.967
ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS TO TRY AND

02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:31.268
CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AND

02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:34.104
SO- THAT IS THEN YOU KNOW TO

02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:35.773
OUR NEXT STEP AND THE ULTIMATE

02:33:35.839 --> 02:33:38.609
STEP WHICH IS- GETTING OUR OWN

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:42.046
CLAM SHELLS BACK. AND SO- I'M

02:33:42.112 --> 02:33:43.280
I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:45.616
FIRST PURCHASE. FOR THERMOFORM

02:33:45.683 --> 02:33:48.719
CLEAN WASH LAKE WHICH IS WHAT

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:49.219
YOU GET WHEN YOU RECYCLE

02:33:49.286 --> 02:33:51.488
CLAMSHELL- IT HAS OCCURRED IN

02:33:51.555 --> 02:33:53.390
IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE STILL HAVE

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:54.758
A LONG WAY TO GO WE'RE TALKING

02:33:54.825 --> 02:33:56.994
ABOUT VERY SMALL AMOUNT BUT-

02:33:57.061 --> 02:34:00.264
BUT IT IS STARTING. AND AND THE

02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:02.366
FIRST THING THAT WE'VE OBSERVED

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:04.668
IN THAT PROCESS IS THAT-

02:34:04.735 --> 02:34:06.236
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT BEEN A

02:34:06.303 --> 02:34:08.238
MARKET PLACE PREVIOUSLY-

02:34:08.305 --> 02:34:09.573
THEY'RE JUST A VERY LIMITED

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.141
NUMBER OF CLAM SHELLS ARE

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:13.177
CURRENTLY BEING RECYCLED- IN

02:34:13.243 --> 02:34:15.479
SOME. REGIONS IN THE STATE THEY

02:34:15.546 --> 02:34:19.350
ARE BUT NOT ALL. AND SO- THAT'S

02:34:19.416 --> 02:34:21.885
THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP IS TO. NOT

02:34:21.952 --> 02:34:23.487
ONLY JUST MAKE THE PURCHASES

02:34:23.554 --> 02:34:24.955
BUT TO WORK WITH THE RECYCLING

02:34:25.022 --> 02:34:27.825
SUPPLY CHAIN TO- ENCOURAGE

02:34:27.891 --> 02:34:30.361
CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE AS WELL AS

02:34:30.427 --> 02:34:31.929
AT THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS TO

02:34:31.996 --> 02:34:33.330
COLLECT THOSE CLAM SHELLS SO

02:34:33.397 --> 02:34:34.632
THAT WE CAN GET HIM INTO THAT

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:36.300
RECYCLING PIPELINE SO WE CAN

02:34:36.367 --> 02:34:39.403
BUY THAT FROM A FORM CLEAN WASH

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:41.505
LIKE. SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT

02:34:41.572 --> 02:34:45.075
IN. CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES IN

02:34:45.142 --> 02:34:46.543
THEM AND THE BERRY INDUSTRY FOR

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.846
NORTH AMERICA AND YEAH. PLEASED

BE FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS-

02:35:30.921 --> 02:35:32.790
ARE THAT YOU HAVE ON THE

02:35:32.856 --> 02:35:35.092
SECTION JUST WONDERING ABOUT

02:35:35.159 --> 02:35:36.393
THE INCREASED USE OF PESONAL

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.628
PROTECTIVE- PROTECTIVE

02:35:37.695 --> 02:35:38.862
EQUIPMENT AND THE PLASTIC THAT

02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:40.631
WE SEE IN THAT AND HOW THAT'S

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.366
IT WE HAVE ANY DATA ABOUT. THAT

02:35:42.433 --> 02:35:44.902
IN OUR WASTE STREAM ON AND HOW

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:47.671
WE'RE MANAGING THAT. I DON'T

02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:50.040
HAVE ANY SPECIFIC DATA- WEEK WE

02:35:50.107 --> 02:35:52.342
HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN. I THINK

02:35:52.409 --> 02:35:52.976
WE HEARD SOME OTHERS SPEAKERS

02:35:53.043 --> 02:35:54.478
SAY THE SAME THING WE HAVE SEEN

02:35:54.545 --> 02:35:57.281
AN UPTICK IN- MASKS AND

02:35:57.347 --> 02:35:59.049
GARMENTS AND GLOVES ARE SHOWING

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:00.484
UP IN A RECYCLING FACILITIES

02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:02.152
WHICH IS TROUBLING- THAT'S

02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:03.587
CONTAMINATION FOR US THERE ARE

02:36:03.654 --> 02:36:05.089
NOT. AND MARKETS FOR THOSE

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:07.357
TYPES OF MATERIALS- BUT YOU

02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:10.094
KNOW I WOULD EXPECT THAT. AND-

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.029
WE SEE ADDITIONAL UPTICK- IN

02:36:12.096 --> 02:36:13.931
OUR IN A STUDY STREAMS AS WELL-

02:36:13.997 --> 02:36:15.332
AND THEN I YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY

02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:16.767
IMAGINE YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:36:16.834 --> 02:36:18.736
HOSPITALS AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:36:18.802 --> 02:36:21.004
INSTITUTIONS ARE DEALING WITH.

02:36:21.071 --> 02:36:23.006
THE THAT THEY'RE UTILIZING BUT-

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.341
NOT AND THAT NO SPECIFIC DATE-

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:26.744
THERE THERE'S PROBABLY- SO.

02:36:26.810 --> 02:36:28.746
THAT WE CAN DIG UP IN TERMS OF

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:31.048
P. P. E. PRODUCTION AND SALES-

02:36:31.115 --> 02:36:34.852
THAT- WE COULD PROBABLY- YOU

02:36:34.918 --> 02:36:38.655
KNOW DO SOME MATH AROUND- WHAT

02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:39.256
THAT MEANS FOR A GENERATION OF

02:36:39.323 --> 02:36:41.892
WASTE. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

02:36:41.959 --> 02:36:44.828
HAVE SORT OF A PLAN FOR THAT

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:48.298
OR- YOU CAN SHOW CAMPAIGN ARE.

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:51.201
SHE WILL BE BEING PROACTIVE.

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:52.302
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

02:36:52.369 --> 02:36:54.371
LOOKED AT- AT THE PAST IN THE

02:36:54.438 --> 02:36:56.173
PAST- ON THE YOU KNOW OUR

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.342
THEY'RE VIABLE AND MARKETS FOR

02:36:58.408 --> 02:37:00.477
THOSE TYPES OF MATERIALS- YOU

02:37:00.544 --> 02:37:04.515
KNOW A MASK- YOU KNOWSEVERAL

02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:05.749
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS SO

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:07.951
MULTI MATERIAL ASSEMBLY FOR

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:09.820
GARMENTS YOU USUALLY HAVE SOME

02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:12.489
WOVEN NON WOVEN- MULTIPLE TYPES

02:37:12.556 --> 02:37:15.192
OF RESIN SO THE RECYCLING THOSE

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:17.895
MATERIALS. CAN BE PARTICULARLY

02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:19.530
CHALLENGING YOU KNOW THE OTHER

02:37:19.596 --> 02:37:21.098
THING THAT'S CHALLENGING IN IN

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:22.699
A LOT OF RECYCLING MARKET

02:37:22.766 --> 02:37:24.468
PLACES PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:26.670
DEALING WITH EXPORT MARKETS-

02:37:26.737 --> 02:37:31.308
ANY ANY. FORM OF MATERIAL THAT

02:37:31.375 --> 02:37:32.242
COULD BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL

02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:34.845
WASTE- IS PARTICULARLY

02:37:34.912 --> 02:37:37.447
PROBLEMATIC FOR- ACCEPTANCE OF

02:37:37.514 --> 02:37:40.284
MATERIALS- AND COULD LEAD TO

02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:43.554
THE REJECTIONS OF ENTIRE LOADS.

02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:44.555
I THINK THE UNITED I THINK

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:46.089
THOSE MATERIALS ARE BEST

02:37:46.156 --> 02:37:50.594
MANAGED IN THE GARBAGE. ACTITUD

02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:52.262
MARTIN AT THE ECOLOGY AND I

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:54.431
WOULD JUST SAY- VERY SIMILARLY

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:55.499
WE'VE SEEN SOME IN OUR

02:37:55.566 --> 02:37:58.202
RECYCLING PROGRAM- WE THINK THE

02:37:58.268 --> 02:37:59.970
MESSAGE IS PRETTY CLEAR OUT

02:38:00.037 --> 02:38:02.206
THERE THAT THESE ARE- TO BE PUT

02:38:02.272 --> 02:38:04.441
IN THE GARBAGE AND NOT MOST

02:38:04.508 --> 02:38:07.044
LIKELY. BUT WE HAVE SEEN SOME-

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:08.946
IF WE WERE TO TAKE A PROACTIVE

02:38:09.012 --> 02:38:10.914
APPROACH TO THEM I WOULD SAY

02:38:10.981 --> 02:38:14.117
REALLY FOCUSING ON REVIEWS- AND

02:38:14.184 --> 02:38:15.786
RE USABLE FOR THE AVERAGE

02:38:15.853 --> 02:38:17.521
CONSUMER- THE END AVERAGE

02:38:17.588 --> 02:38:19.790
RESIDENTS HAVE A REUSABLE MASK.

02:38:19.857 --> 02:38:21.925
IS IMPORTANT AS OPPOSED TO A

02:38:21.992 --> 02:38:23.827
DISPOSABLE AND BE ABLE TO YOU

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:25.128
KNOW UNDERSTAND WHAT WASHING

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:27.064
AND SANITIZING ANYTHING OF THE

02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:28.498
PERPETRATORS AND THEN FOR THE

02:38:28.565 --> 02:38:31.001
MEDICAL INDUSTRY I'M REALLY YOU

02:38:31.068 --> 02:38:32.369
