THE BOARD. THIS IS PARTICULARLY

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.650
TRUE FOR THE SMALLER CITIES.

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:27.885
AND THE GRAND JURY REPORTS HAVE

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.221

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.634
AB TEN NINETY ONE WITH THESE

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.102
RECOMMENDATIONS IN MIND. AT A

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:46.470
HIGH LEVEL THE BILL WOULD

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:47.605
REQUIRE THE APPOINTING

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:48.606
AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.307

EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT. ARE

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.983
REPRESENTED ON THE BOARD. IT

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.084
WOULD EXPAND THE TERMS ON THE

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.385
BOARD FROM TWO YEARS TO FOUR

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.053
YEARS FOR GREATER CONTINUITY.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.321
IT WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.357
BOARD SIZE FROM EIGHTEEN

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:07.992
MEMBERS TO NINE VOTING MEMBERS.

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:08.893
AND IT WOULD REPLACE THE

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:11.228
ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THE BOARD

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:11.829
WITH QUALIFIED MEMBERS OF THE

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.198
PUBLIC. WHILE THE BILL. WELL

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.132
THE BILL REDUCES THE TOTAL

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.100
NUMBER OF BOARD MEMBERS

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.135
APPOINTED BY SAN JOSE IN BY THE

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.870
NON SAN JOSE CITIES. IT IS

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:21.338
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:22.673
BILL MAINTAINS THE CURRENT

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.541
BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.644
GROUPS. IT DOES NOT TAKE POWER

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.212
AWAY FROM SAN JOSE AND GIVE

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:30.614
MORE POWER. TO THE SMALLER

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.783
CITIES OR VICE VERSA. HOWEVER

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.018
THE BILL INCREASES THE NUMBER

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:35.085
OF MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE

00:42:35.152 --> 00:42:36.320
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS EACH

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.254
SUPERVISOR WOULD APPOINT ONE

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.989
DIRECTOR. THIS WAS DONE WITH

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.491
THE HOPE. THAT BOARD MEMBERS

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.393
WILL ACT MORE REGIONALLY AND

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.360
LESSEN THE PAROCHIAL BEST

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:45.262
INTEREST OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITY

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.398
THEY REPRESENT. I'VE HAD MORE

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.456
THERE IS SOME CHANGE I WOULD

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.725
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT- AB

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:36.659
EIGHT OH FIVE FROM ASSEMBLY

WELL IT DOES NOT ALLOW

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.032
APPOINTMENTS AND THE YOU KNOW

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.667
WE HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:45.668
MAYBE WE DON'T AGREE ABOUT

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.804
APPOINTMENTS- I'M PREPARED TO

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:48.905

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.473
BILL WE HAD EXTENSIVE.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.341
CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN TO DO

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.710
ANYTHING I CAN TO HELP OF WITH

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:57.313
OTHER AGENCIES HAVE STRUGGLED-

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.015
AND I DO THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.317
SURE THAT WE HAVE- CLEAR

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.352
GUARDRAILS ON APPOINTMENTS I

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.021
THINK APPOINTMENTS THAT WE HAVE

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.055
AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:06.722
COMPONENT- ACTIVE

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.425
TRANSPORTATION COMPONENT- ARE

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:10.893
ARE BETTER THAN JUST ALLOWING

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.662
RANDOM APPOINTMENTS BY PEOPLE

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.497
WHO ARE NOT ELECTED I THINK

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.932
THERE IS A VALUE IN HAVING

01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:17.300
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ON

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.267
REGIONAL BOARDS AND I

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.002
UNDERSTAND CURRENTLY IN YOUR

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.937
DISTRICT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.939
MINE- PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE FULL

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.507
TIME JOBS AS WELL AND SO

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.441
SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE A

01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:27.810
PROBLEM. WITH DOING THAT SO I'M

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.579
HAPPY TO SUPPORT TO SPONSOR YOU

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:30.913
TOO MUCH TO KEEP WORKING ON IT

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:35.284

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.219
WHEN IT COMES THE FOR. IF YOU

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:37.453
OR SOMEONE BROWN AND IT'S THE

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.055
PRIOR CONVERSE. IN THIS. FOR TO

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.490
LOOK AT AND RENTING I'M GONNA

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.859
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AND-

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.927
YOU KNOW IT. I'LL STOP THERE

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.262
AND ALL THE OTHER QUESTIONS AND

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.364
CLOSE BRIDGET THANKS. FOR THEIR

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.901
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.503
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LUCKY. YEAH WE

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:55.938
IN THE SPOKEN PREVIOUSLY I'VE-

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:58.207
SERVED ON CUBA TRANSPORTATION

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.943
BOARDS BOTH WITH THE- APPOINTED

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.811
AND ELECTED AND I THINK THE

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:04.514
HYBRID MODEL. BECAUSE I THINK

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.314
BOTH HAVE MERIT IF DONE

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.383
PROPERLY- I THINK THE

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.951
ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE FOR

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.620
ELECTED OFFICIALS IS IMPORTANT.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:11.888
AND I THINK THAT APPOINTED

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.022
MEMBERS SOMETIMES HAVE

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.224
EXPERTISE. AND THE ABILITY TO

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:18.394
PROVIDE. GREATER INSIGHT. BUT

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.396
TO HAVE JUST ALL OF ONE. I

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.665
THINK IS A- VERY DIFFICULT HAVE

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.233
GOOD GOVERNANCE AND WHAT THE

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.535
TRANSPORTATION BOARDS I SERVED

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.570
ON HAVE HIGHBRIDGE. AND I THINK

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.471
THAT THEY HAVE SERVED THE

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.306
PUBLIC WELL AND SO. I'M NOT

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:31.507
PREPARED TO SUPPORT IT AT THIS

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:35.044
POINT BUT ALL SUPPORT ON THE

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:35.611

SOME CONCERNS THE BILL DOES NOT

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:22.837

NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR EITHER OF

THE TWO CITIES. SO I THINK IT

02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:15.054

THAT TIME YEAH SO I THINK IT'S

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:57.963
