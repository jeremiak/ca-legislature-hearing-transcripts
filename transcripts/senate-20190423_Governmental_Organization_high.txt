FOUR THAT'S A FILE ORDERS BUT ALL RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER NINE MILLION CHILDREN. WHAT CHILD WELFARE IS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE AMONG? THE WORST OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN HEALTH EDUCATION JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY FIRST AND FOR PER PUPIL SPENDING CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY THIRD FOR THE RATE OF YOUNG CHILDREN RECEIVING DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS. AND HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE RENDERED FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE TODD HAD EXPERIENCES WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY LEAD TO CHRONIC DISEASES ADULTHOOD. WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES THAT AIM ALLEVIATING THESE CHALLENGES AND YET WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE NEED TO MOVE ON SOME OF THESE MEASURES. OF CHILD WELL BEING. A CHILDREN'S CABINET MADE UP OF KEY AGENCY LEADERS CAN HELP MOBILIZE EFFORTS AND RESOURCES ROUTE STATE PRIORITIES FOR CHILDREN IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND SERVICE DELIVERY CROSS STATE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. AS BEFORE TWENTY ONE WOULD ESTABLISH THE CHILDREN'S CABINET DEVELOP A SHARED VISION AMONG THE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT NOR TO PRODUCE.

THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION CONSIDERS CHILDREN'S CABINETS A BEST PRACTICE AND EARLY SIXTEEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE A CHILDREN'S CABINET.

OKAY ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB. FIVE TWELVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OUT THE PRESENT SB FIVE TWELVE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH -- MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS WHICH WILL ACCEPT TO ADD A FIVE YEAR SUNSET TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. SB FIVE TWELVE TAKES THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP TWO IS CREATING A NEW LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OUR L. TSS BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION THIS NEW BENEFIT IS URGENT ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE EITHER OLDER ADULTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL MENTAL DISABILITIES CURRENTLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS POPULATION WILL GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE L. TSS SERVICES. LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MOST CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR LTE ASSESSES THE HIGHLY EXPENSIVE AND CREATES A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SOCIAL BURDEN FOR FAMILIES. ALTERNATIVE LEE CALIFORNIANS MUST SPEND DOWN THROUGH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW. TOO OFTEN THIS IS THE PRIMARY MEANS BY WHICH OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE ACCESS TO PAID LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. MEDI CAL IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET BUT THIS SYSTEM IS BEING OVER BURDEN AND CERTAINLY -- AT HAVING TO BE SUPPORTED BY TAXPAYERS. INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE TO IMPOVERISH THEMSELVES SPEND THROUGH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND OUR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE OR TO FOREGO WORKING IN A GENERATING EARNED INCOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO LIVE. INDEPENDENT HIGH QUALITY LIVES. THIS LEGISLATION IS CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. BLOTTER SUBJECT SERVICES SUPPORTS BENEFIT TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE TWELVE CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE MODELED AFTER THE CALCIUM OR SECURE CHOICE PROGRAM FOR WITH. NGUYEN CALIFORNIA'S RATE TO THE SIGN IN FINANCE AND YOUBENEFIT INDEED THIS LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF L. T.. STAKEHOLDERS WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD NOW TO PUT THESE CRITICAL PIECES IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH BENEFIT AND FINANCING DESIGN. WE WILL -- I PLEASED TO HAVE IN SUPPORT TESTIMONY FROM THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND A. R. P. EXPECT THE ASPIRIN I THOUGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. CRISTINA MILLS FROM THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS A VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE. FOR AT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AN AGING COMMUNITY AND INTRODUCING OUR WONDERFUL SPEAKER TODAY FROM SACRAMENTO CAME LATE TRIP TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE BILL WOULD. HELP HER IF IT WERE PASSED WE ARE IN SUPPORT. SPORTING GOOD MORNING -- AS MENTIONED MY NAME'S CAM LATER OUT I AM THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I LIVE WITH A DISABILITY. I WAS BORN WITHOUT ARMS OR LEGS. ALSO AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I AM A REGISTERED VOTER -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I MEAN HERE IN SUPPORT FOR IT SB. FIVE TWELVE FOR AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER. I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT WORKING FULL TIME AND KEEPING MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES WOULD JUST NOT BE POSSIBLE. INSTEAD OF JUST ACCEPTING THAT IS FACT I DECIDED TO CHALLENGE IT. I WANTED TO COME HOME AT NIGHT KNOWING THAT I SPENT MY DAY NOT ONLY DOING MY PART IN CONTRIBUTING AND GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITIES. BUT I DID MY PART AS AN AMERICAN TAXPAYER WHO COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MY COUNTRY. A FEW YEARS BACK WHAT I HAD ALWAYS DREAMED BECAME A REALITY WHEN I WAS OFFERED MY VERY FIRST INTERNSHIP. THAT INTERNSHIP TURNED INTO A PART TIME JOB. AND EVENTUALLY AFTER HARD WORK. MY FULL TIME MY PART TIME JOB TURNED INTO A FULL TIME -- JOB. THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO MAKE TO ACCEPT THAT JOB. BECAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS AN INCOME THRESHOLD. TO WHAT I COULD EARN IN ORDER TO KEEP MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. NONE THE LESS I DECIDED TO PERSEVERE AND MOVE FORWARD. ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT I NEVER HAD THAT INCOME LIMIT AS TO PUT MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES AT RISK. BUT BUT IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY FATHER PASSED AWAY. AND I BEGAN TO RECEIVE SOME OF HIS BENEFITS. THIS MEANT THAT I COULD NO LONGER KEEP MY EARNED INCOME. AND MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. SO I WAS FACED WITH THE CHOICE. TO EITHER KEEP MY HEALTH CARE AND MY PERSONAL CARE ATTENDANTS THAT ENABLES ME TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. OR TO QUIT MY JOB. A JOB THAT I HAD WORKED SO HARD. FOR A JOB WHERE I WAS GROWING MY SKILLS IN. AND HAD THE WHERE I HAD BUILT MY COMMUNITY AND MY NETWORK THROUGH. I THOUGHT ROB THAT I WAS FORCED TO BE DUG GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND I ALSO FELT DISAPPOINTED THAT I WAS GOING TO REMAIN ON THE SYSTEM. BUT SINCE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR MY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES ON MY EARNED INCOME ALONE. I DID QUIT MY JOB. SO THAT I CAN MAINTAIN LIVING AT HOME AND LIVING INDEPENDENTLY. I AM NOT ALONE. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR FACED WITH THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS. WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE JOBS CAREERS AND EARN AN INCOME OR TO KEEP THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT WE NEED TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THIS DECISION IS NOT FAIR AND IT IS ALWAYS PLACED ON PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WITH YOUR SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE TWELVE THERE WILL BE MORE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF SO THAT WE ARE NOT FACED WITH THESE UNFAIR SITUATIONS. THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PURSUE A CAREER. WITHOUT RISKING OUR SERVICES. THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO LIVE THE LIFE WE DESERVE. TO LIVE SAFELY AND INDEPENDENTLY IN OUR OWN HOMES AND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. I STRONGLY LOOK FORWARD TO GOING BACK TO WORK AND HAVING THE SUPPORT OF SB FIVE TWELVE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START-OFF BY SUBPOENA COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OFFERED -- BY THE COMMITTEE WHICH WOULD AMEND THE BILL TO CLARIFY THAT THE RIDLEY ARMORIES NOW ELIGIBLE FOR SALE. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR CHAIR AND FELIPE LOPEZ WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE ON THESE IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS. A SENATE BILL FIVE ALL ONE WILL HELP A SMALL COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY RETAIN AN ARMORY THAT WILL HELP SERVE OUR VETERANS IN THE REGION. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS RIDLEY AREA VETERANS HAVE OPERATED THE ARMORY FOR VARIOUS EVENTS INCLUDING VETERAN SERVICES. THE READ LEE AREA VETERANS WORK TO HELP RETURNING VETERANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE. OR WORKING WITH FOUNDATIONS THE LIKE THE JOE LUSK MEMORIAL FOUNDATION TO PER RIGHT TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOOD AND ASSISTANCE WITH MEDICAL COSTS TO VETERANS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE CITY OF RIDLEY AS INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THE ARMORY STAYS IN THE COMMUNITY FOR PURPOSES OF SERVING OUR VETERANS. AND ALREADY WORKS TO MAINTAIN THE ARMORY INCLUDING THE LAWN AND LANDSCAPING AND WORKS WITH NONPROFIT ENTITIES TO ENSURE VETERANS SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO VETERANS IN THE REGION. HOWEVER AS A RIDLEY ARMORY WAS AUTHORIZED FOR SALE BY THE BY LAST YEAR'S COMMITTEE BILL AB. THREE TWO FIVE ONE THE CITY OF RIDLEY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO KEEP THE ARMY NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN. UP FOR SALE. THE WRIGLEY ARMORY SERVES AS A CRITICAL ACCESS POINT FOR VETERANS AND RIDLEY AND SURROUNDING REGION. WHO OFTEN HAVE TO DIFFICULTY ACCESSING YOUR AMERICAN LEGION POSTER NEARBY VETERANS ARE BEING ORGANIZATIONS? FOR EXAMPLE THE NEAREST VETERANS MEMORIAL DISTRICT IS IN CLOVIS OVER TWO HOURS AWAY BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND FORTY MINUTES AWAY BY CAR. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED SB FIVE A ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL. THERE ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND VETERANS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE CRITICAL SERVICES BY CLARIFYING CLARIFYING THAT THE ARMORY IS NOT -- ELIGIBLE FOR CELL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE PAUL MELIKIAN REPRESENTING THE CITY OF RIDLEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- HER TADO. THOSE AYE COMMENTS WE WE ABSOLUTELY -- SUPPORT THOSE COMMENTS. THE CITY OF RIDLEY IS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WITH POCKETS THAT ARE ACTUALLY CLASSIFIED AS SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED AND FOR OVER A DECADE THE READ LEE AREA VETERANS HAVE SIX SUCCESSFULLY OPERATED THE THE ARMORY AS A REGIONAL -- FACILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF VETERANS OF ALL BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY. THE FACILITY IS WELL USED BY VETERANS -- BETTER BOTH IN THE CITY AND IN THE ENTIRE REGION THAT ACTUALLY -- PART WORLD WAR TWO VETERANS KOREA VIETNAM AS AND TO THE MORE RECENT WARS AND ENGAGEMENT -- IN THE MIDDLE EAST THIS IS A TRULY MULTI GENERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CREATED A STRONG SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THOSE RECENT VETERANS THAT ARE TRANSITIONING BACK INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GREATEST. DIED THE GREATEST GENERATION TO GIVE BACK IN WAYS THAT THEY SIMPLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARMORY -- THE CITY IS A GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WORLD COMMUNITY WITH AS THE AS A SENATOR SPOKE IS AT THE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR THE ECONOMICALLY OR MOBILITY CHALLENGED ARE SOMETIMES SEVERAL HOURS -- WAY AND RECOGNIZING THIS NEED THE READ LEE AREA VETERANS FORMED A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHOSE SOLE MISSION IT IS TO OPERATE THE THE FOR THE ARMORY FOR THE BENEFIT OF VETERANS UP ALL BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY. ONE SUCH IMPORTANT ACTIVITY IS -- HOSTING REGULAR RESOURCE FAIRS TO CONNECT VETERANS TO CRITICAL IMPORTANCE SERVICES IN THEIR LIVES ESPECIALLY THOSE TRANSITIONING BACK IN THOSE TO CIVILIAN LIFE. THE CITY. FOR THE RIDLEY AREA VETERAN SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDING AT THIS TIME TO PURCHASE THE FACILITY OUT RIGHT HOWEVER OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE UNEQUIVOCALLY FEEL THAT SELLING TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. WHICH SERVE TO DESTABILIZE THE VETERANS AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT IS OCCURRING AT THE FACILITY I PERSONALLY HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER THAT WAS STATIONED AT THE ATTHE ARMORY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND CAN ATTEST THAT THERE IS A VERY STRONG EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO THIS REGIONAL -- FACILITY AT THAT AND AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR IN THE ENTIRE REGION WE IMPLORE YOU TO PLEASE ALLOW THE RIDLEY AREA VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED THIS COUNTRY AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD IN THEIR DARKEST HOURS. TO TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A PLACE TO ASSEMBLE A PLACE TO VOLUNTEER A PLACE TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER AND TO REMAIN A BEACON IN THIS CAN THIS SIDE COMMUNITY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER ARCHULETA. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR AGAIN FOR STANDING UP FOR HER COMMUNITY. IN THE CERTAINLY THE VETERANS AND IS WHEN IT BECAME -- WHEN IT VIA THE BILL BECAME BEFORE OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE MY CONCERN IS THAT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE USE FOR VETERANS? ALL BRANCHES NOT GIVEN TO ONE PARTICULAR UNIT LIKE VFW AMERICAN LEGION -- AMVETS ANYONE BUT JUST GENERALLY USED BY ALL BETTER AND AND UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE CITY. AND FOR MAINTENANCE AND CARE AND THE END OF THE MANAGEMENT. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE THE CONDITIONS. THE OTHER OF WHICH ARE ANY LAST MINUTE -- AMENDMENTS FROM A FEW HOURS AGO TO NOW IN REFERENCE TO A LEASE PURCHASE. A NON PURCHASE AND IT WAS THERE ANY AMENDMENTS THAT THE THREE MEN. OF THE OTHER THE THE ONE AMENDMENT -- IS A IT IMMENSE -- FIVE OH ONE THAT WILL DELETE CURRENT CONTENTS THE BILL INSTEAD WOULD REMOVE THE CURRENT AUTHORIZATION TO SELL. THE THE THE ARMORY. AND SO -- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING -- THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOWS US TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH OUR POLICIES. THAT WE'VE HAD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THE SALE OF STATE PROPERTY. EVERYBODY IS BEING TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY YOUR END GAME HERE IS -- YEAH OUT.

WHILE FINANCES OPERATIONAL ON EDISON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING LOCAL AGENCIES WITH THE NUCLEAR POWER PREPAREDNESS FUNDS. THESE FUNDS WERE USED BY COUNTIES AND CITIES TO PLAN AND PREPARE DRILL IN RESPOND TO ANY EMERGENCY INCIDENTS REGARDING THE NUCLEAR SITES. THE COMMISSION PLANTS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING SUCH FUNDING EVEN THOUGH THAT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STORED NUCLEAR FUEL REMAINS. SB FOR SIXTY FIVE MAKES IT CLEAR IN STATUTE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR COSTS INCURRED. AS A RESULT OF CARRYING OUT ACTIVITIES THAT ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING SONGS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN EDISON IN THE COUNTIES.

YES HE IS ALWAYS BEEN COMMITTED TO PROVIDING CONTINUED FUNDING FOR OFF SITE LOCAL AGENCIES. HOWEVER IF THE AS HE DOES BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR OFFSET AGENCIES SHOULD BE INFORMED BY THE LEVEL OF RISK WHICH ALREADY IS GREATLY REDUCED -- DUE TO THE NUCLEAR REACTORS BEING PERMANENTLY DE FUELED. IN SIMPLE TERMS THIS MEANS IS SONGS NO LONGER IS AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN FOR INSTANCE -- IN THE REACTORS.

DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE HERE BESIDES ME. SHOULD I JUST [inaudible] GLAZER. GOOD MORNING WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL WE'VE GOT TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN SB. SEVEN SIX SEVEN MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORNING. LET ME CREATE SOME CONTEXT FOR THIS SIDE THIS BILL. I TO DISTRICT BILL FOR ME. I HAVE IN MY DISTRICT IN OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARK. NOTHING IN THE END THIS BILL CHANGES THAT. THEY ARE. SPACE THAT -- MANY USED TO ENJOY THAT ACTIVITY IF YOU LIKE IT SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT SOME PEOPLE DON'T. NOTHING IN THIS BILL AFFECTS THAT EXISTING PARK THERE ARE TOO MANY IN THE STATE BUT I HAVE. ONE THERE'S A EXPANSION PROPOSAL TO THIS PARK. REFERRED TO ASSESS Là. THE PARKS DEPARTMENT BOUGHT THE PROPERTY [inaudible] A COUPLE [inaudible] DECADES AGO -- AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO CREATE AN EXPANSION OF THAT PARK. NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THAT PROCESS. THE LAND'S BEEN PURCHASED THEY'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DEVELOP IT. AND MY LEGISLATION DOESN'T CHANGE THAT AT ALL. BUT THIS LAND FOR THIS EXPANSION HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT IT. AT THE SENSITIVE PARCEL OF LAND I'M GONNA HAVE SOME WONDERFUL WITNESSES WILL TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY. ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES AND WHAT IT ONLY DOES. IS THAT IF THE PARKS DEPARTMENT AND THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE COMMISSION. DECIDES THAT THIS EXPANSION AT THIRD THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG LONG TIME IS IN LITIGATION AFTER LITIGATION AFTER LITIGATION IF THEY DECIDE. THAT THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK WE HAVE AN EXISTING PARK WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT BUT THIS EXPANSION IS TOO CONTROVERSIAL. THIS LEGISLATION GIVES THEM THE CHANCE TO HAVE A CHOICE TO TRY TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK. THAT'S IT. GIVES THEM THE OPTION. HI THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT I RAN ON IN MY CAMPAIGN I TOOK NO POSITION ON UNTIL I COULD RESEARCH IT CAREFULLY AND THOUGHTFULLY. AND I DID. ALONG WITH THIS FAMILY WOMAN CATHERINE BAKER THE REPUBLICAN -- WHO USED TO REPRESENT THIS AREA? AND AFTER ALL THAT WORK THAT WE DID TO KEEP IT HERE FROM ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE SHOULD AT LEAST BE AN OPTION. IF THIS LITIGATION AND THIS CONTROVERSY'S GOING NO WHERE TO HAVE AN OPTION TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THE OFF HIGHWAY FUND. pTO ENHANCE THAT ACTIVITY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR EVEN NEARBY. SIXTEEN LEGISLATORS SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JOIN WITH US LAST YEAR IN ENCOURAGING THE PARKS DEPARTMENT TO PURSUE THIS OPTION. THEIR ANSWER IS WE CAN'T DO IT LEGALLY WE NEED A BILL TO GIVE US THAT RIGHT IF WE EVER CHOSE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT'S -- BEFORE YOU. YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM MY WITNESSES ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE LAND NEXT DOOR THIS BILL COULD PROTECT. BUT I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS THAT YOU'LL ALSO HEAR IN A MOMENT. THEY MAKE THE ASSERTION THAT THIS LEGISLATION FORCES A SALE FORCES NOT. THIS BILL DOESN'T FORCE ANYTHING. THE ONLY WAY THISBILL GOES INTO OPERATION IT TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT AND THE OFF HIGHWAY. VEHICLE COMMISSION WHICH IS MADE UP OF ENTHUSIASTS FOR OFF HIGHWAY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. IF WE CAN GET OUR MONEY BACK. THAT MIGHT BE THE BEST COURSE FOR TRYING. TO ENCOURAGE THAT ACTIVITY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR EVEN NEARBY SO THAT MY FRIENDS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. TO DISTRICT BILL I HAVE SOME WONDERFUL WITNESSES TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE MORE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SENATOR. HI -- CATHERINE PHILLIPS WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS STATEWIDE AND THEY INCLUDE ACTIVE MEMBERS AND VOLUNTEERS IN THE AREA WHERE THIS PARK. EXISTS IN WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS TO HAVE IT PRESERVED AS A PARK A PASSIVE PARK -- OUR LOCAL SIERRA CLUB CHAPTER IS PART OF THE ALTAMONT. LANDFILL OPEN SPACE COMMITTEE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING LOCAL OPEN SPACE MITIGATION FUNDS IN THAT HAS OFFERED TO USE ITS LOCAL FUNDS TO PURCHASE THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION AREA -- WE CARE ABOUT THIS LAND SO MUCH BECAUSE SIMPLY IT IS A STUNNING BIODIVERSITY HOT SPOT THE MOIST COAST RANGE MEETS THE NORTH EDGE OF THE DRY SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN JUST CREATES A VERY UNUSUAL. HABITAT -- IT'S GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS BLUE OAK WOODLAND AND GRASSLAND BUT THAT DOESN'T DO THE PLACE JUSTICE IT'S UNLIKE OTHER WOODLANDS AND GRASSLANDS IN THE REGION BECAUSE OF ITS BIODIVERSITY RICHNESS BECAUSE IT BRINGS TOGETHER ESSENTIALLY. FIVE SORT OF ECO SYSTEMS. AND ONE OF THOSE THE IT'S IT'S DRAWN LEADING NATURALISTS FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS INCLUDING -- JOHN ME OR WHO WAS THE FOUNDER OF SIERRA CLUB AND THE FATHER OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM -- THE SCIENTISTS CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON ECOLOGICAL VALUE OF THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSIONARY WAS SIGNED BY FORTY FIVE SCIENTISTS INCLUDING. LEADING PROFESSORS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES -- IT HAS FORTY TWO SPECIAL STATUS WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING EIGHT FEDERALLY OR STATE LISTED IN CANDIDATES SPECIES. AND I COULD GO ON WITH LOTS OF DETAILS ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE VALUE -- BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY IT'S A VERY SPECIAL PLACE AND THIS BILL FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC LOCAL ISSUE AS THE AUTHOR NOTED. THAT WILL PROVIDE BOTH OF WHY HE'S OF USE OF OF A RESOLUTION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND WILL BE FAIR TO STATE PARKS AND TO THE DIVISION. OF OFF HIGHWAY MOTOR VEHICLE RECREATION -- BUT IT HAS STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE AGAIN THIS PLACE IS -- IS A AN ECOLOGICALLY VALUABLE PLACE THAT AGAIN HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OR THE THE SUBJECT OF LOTS OF STUDY FOR GENERATIONS -- THIS AREA JUST SCREAMS FOR GOOD RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP AND THE BACK THIS BILL WILL OPEN A PATHWAY TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF STEWARDSHIP THAT IT WARRANTS SO I URGE THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. MORNING MY NAME IS NANCY RHETORIC I'M FROM LIVERMORE.

ALL OF THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION AREA IS LOCATED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THERE'S OVERWHELMING LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. SIX PUBLIC AGENCIES INCLUDING THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA AND AT THE CITY OF LIVERMORE. ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THE LOCAL OPEN SPACE FUND HAS OFFERED THE MONEY FOR THE PURCHASE OF TESLA. SENATE BILL SIX SEVEN SIX SEVEN DOES NOT TAKE AWAY ANY OF THE EXISTING CARNEGIE ALWAYS BE WRITING AREAS. STATE PARKS DID NOT COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION E. I. R. PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE EXPANSION AREA. SO PUBLIC NOTICE DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTER THE LAND WAS ALREADY PURCHASED IN. TWO THOUSAND SB TWO FORTY NINE LAST YEAR DID NOT ADDRESS TESLA. PRESERVATION. BUT IF TWO FOR TWO FOR FOUR NINE WERE FOLLOWED TUSSLE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED -- FOR EACH P. RECREATION. ALMOST THE ENTIRE AREA WE SHOULD INSTEAD BE DESIGNATED AS A SENSITIVE AREA AND PROTECTED BY STATUTE. THE EXPANSION AREA IN THE PROPOSED VOICE HM VIS OUR PLAN IS ONLY DESIGNATED AS A MOTORIZED VEHICLE PARK LIKE CARNEGIE. NONE OF THE EXPANSION AREA IS PROTECTED AS A DEFINED SENSITIVE AREA. SEVEN SIX SEVEN DOES NOT ESTABLISH ANY STATE WHY PRESIDENT BUT RATHER IT ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC LOCAL ISSUE WITH THE UNIQUE HISTORY. WE'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR GLAZER AND THE BILL'S MANY CO SPONSORS.

BUT TERRY MCHALE WITH THEIR IN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENT A CONSORTIUM OF OHB. ASSOCIATIONS INCLUDING A IN A THIRTY SIX AND THIRTY SEVEN AND AMERICAN SAND ASSOCIATION. WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL LAST YEAR WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THIS YEAR. THE DIFFERENCE HOWEVER IS WE DO APPRECIATE SENATOR GLAZER DID MAKE THE PRICING OF LAST YEAR'S BILL THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF THE CEILING -- AND SECOND OF ALL WE APPRECIATE THAT HIS OFFICE IS BEEN OPEN. AND WILLING TO DISCUSS SOME KIND OF SOLUTION. I'VE LEARNED WITH -- HP THAT DOING AWAY TO BE ISSUES IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN DOING THE DOG CHASING THE BEAR UP THE TREE AND VACCINATIONS. I MEAN IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE FULLER ARE SO POLARIZED ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL BOILS DOWN TO THIS [inaudible] NOBODY. WHO KNOWS SENATOR GLAZER WOULD BELIEVE THAT HE DOES A BILL THAT DOESN'T DO SOMETHING OF SUBSTANCE? HE'S A QUALITY LEGISLATOR WHO DOES A GREAT JOB WITH THIS CONSTITUENTS AND IT'S REFLECTED IN THE ARTICLE THAT COMES OUT AFTER THE LAST BILL IN WHICH THE HEADLINE SAYS. TESLA PARK SALE APPROVED BY STATE SENATE COMMITTEE SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SELL CARNEGIE STATE VEHICULAR RECREATION AREA. FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES CLEARED ITS FIRST HEARING. AND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE BILL THE BILL ITSELF. I AGREE WE NEED A SOLUTION. WE NEED A SOLUTION BECAUSE IT'S GONE ON TOO LONG. HOWEVER THE BILL ONLY GIVES ONE SOLUTION IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE JUDGE ROY BEAN THING YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO A HEARING ON EACH OF FAIR HEARING ON A WAY TO BE AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET RID OF IT. THE BILL DOESN'T SAY WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO THESE HEARINGS AND IT TURNS OUT. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID EVERYTHING CORRECTLY. THIS IS NOT STE LOCAL THIS IS NOT A LOCAL ISSUE THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH MOTORCYCLES WERE WRITTEN ON IT. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH STATE PARKS DID PUBLIC HEARINGS. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH THE STATE PARKS DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO TO REACH THE POINT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THEY DID DO EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THEN THE BILL SHOULD SAY THAT WE WILL EXPEDITE THE USE OF THIS PROPERTY -- FOR HD PURPOSES OF CLOSE BY SAYING THERE TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKS. OF STATE PARKS IN CALIFORNIA ONLY EIGHT OF THEM. DEAL WITH OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH EVEN THOSE WHO STAND UP IN OPPOSITION WERE APPROACHED AND WERE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PARKS DECIDED. IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU PLEASE REJECT THIS BILL THANK YOU MR CALE NEXT SPEAKER [inaudible] OPPOSITION. ANY GRANTED ON BEHALF OF THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION I'M ALSO A OFF ROADER PROUD OFF ROADER. A GRANDMOTHER IN AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES STORED FOR CARNEGIE AND ANY IMPRESSION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THAT THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL. SITES IN KEARNEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN. PROPER REVIEW AND ARE NOT BEING PROTECTED I I FIND SOMEWHAT. IT'S NOT ONLY WRONG BECAUSE I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO IT IT'S SORT OF OFFENSIVE TO THINK THAT WE DON'T. TAKE EVERY BIT [inaudible] OF EVERY BIT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE IMPORTANT SERIOUSLY WITHIN THE OFFROAD COMMUNITY WE HAVE BEEN MMBER MISREPRESENTED OFTEN THIS BILL IS REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN A TAKE MILLIONAIRE WHICH HAS HAPPENED WHO FINDS HIMSELF NEAR REALLY POPULAR SURFING AREA. AND SAYS I DON'T WANT THOSE PEOPLE TRUST PASSING NEAR MY PROPERTY DOESN'T MATTER THAT IT STAYED ON PROPERTY OR COUNTY ON PROPERTY THEY DECIDE IT'S NOT. A USE THAT HE OR SHE FINDS ACCEPTABLE IT'S THE SAME THING THAT WERE FIGHTING HERE IN THIS BILL IS NOT A LOCAL ISSUE THAT WOULD SET A PRECEDENT WHERE ANY. WELL CONNECTED POLITICALLY CONNECTED LOCALS ELLIS CAN DECIDE THAT ANY USE OF A PROPERTY THAT THEY DON'T HAPPEN TO APPROVAL IT. CAN BE PUT UP FOR SALE AND COULD BE PUSHED THROUGH THE SALE BY ANY. AGENCY IN THIS CASE IT'S STATE PARKS -- I WOULD SAY THAT'S A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE -- WHICH WE INTO CS AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO FOREST SERVICE FIGURES THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EIGHT OR NINE EACH BE PARKS. WE NEED A LEGAL PLACED RIDE BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS AREA IS THAT A FULLY THIRD OF THE HEARING WAS SET ASIDE. FOR NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION IN THIS PLAN ANOTHER THING. ANOTHER. AREA THAT WAS REALLY FRIENDLY LOOKED I WAS VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART WAS DISABLED ACCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DISABLED ACCESS TO HAVE THE SABLE PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOOR AND THAT'S ONE THING.

FOR THE MOST PART IT'S PADLOCKED AREA OR IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EVEN IT'S NOT ALLOWABLE EVEN PASSIVE OPEN SPACE LEGALLY. IT'S IN THE POSSESSION OF STATE PARKS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OFFICIAL PUBLIC ENTRY ON IT -- TODAY -- THAT I'M AWARE OF TO BE THROUGH IT ALL YOU'RE SEEKING TO DO IS. GIVE THE STATE PARK THE RIGHT THE STATE PARK SYSTEM THE RIGHT TO DO. WITH THAT AS A FEEL IS THE BEST A LOOK INTERESTED IN ADVANCING A PLAN TO EXPAND THE OFFER HIGHWAY VEHICLE AREA IF THEY DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO ADVANCE THOSE PLANS ANY FURTHER. THEN IT GIVES THEM AN OPTION TO SELL IT AND GET ALL THE MONEY BACK THAT'S ALL IT DOES. THEY COULD THEY ALSO DECIDED JUST MAKE IT A REGULAR STATE PARK OR A OR IS THAT THEY COULD DO -- WELL THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH THE ISSUE OF SELLING IT AS SURPLUS PROPERTY WHATEVER THE CURRENT LAW OR CODE ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO DO -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO HOLD ON TO IT IT WOULD WOULD STILL BE IN PLACE IN WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL WHO ARE THE RESTRICTIONS TO THE KIND OF THE FOLKS THEY COULD SELL IT TO A SURPLUS PROPERTY -- THERE THERE'S THERE'S CODE THERE'S LOTS A IN REGARD TO THAT. AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS HERE BECAUSE WHEN. SIXTEEN LEGISLATORS ALL LAST THE PARKS DEPARTMENT CONSIDER THE SALE THEY SAID WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE LAWFUL RIGHT ONE OF MY QUESTIONS I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM IN THE FOLKS HERE IN SUPPORT. MEAN ISN'T THERE A CONCERN THAT IF IT WERE TO BE SOLD OFF -- AMANDA AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE RULES BUT THAT -- HERE'S THIS. PORTION OF OPEN SPACE -- AND IT COULD BE USED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR OR OTHER -- USES THAT MAY BE OF CONCERN. GIVEN THE FACT IT'S ONE OF THE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL AREA OF A SPACE IN THE AND YOUR PORTION. OF THE BAY AREA I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER PLANS THAT THEY HAVE AT THE MOMENT SO I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON IT EXCEPT THAT WHATEVER THE CURRENT LAW WOULD PROVIDE IN THAT REGARD WOULD BE CHANGED BY THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF THE CHOICE WOULD BE. TO SELL IT FOR CONSERVATION% PURPOSES THIS BILL WOULD GIVE THEM THAT THAT RIGHT. CENTER I I DO HAVE -- THE DEPARTMENT THE YOUR FROM THE BILL. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SHALL SELL THE LAND ONLY TO A LOCAL AGENCY OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOR USE AS A PARK OR OTHER OPEN SPACE PURPOSES OKAY LAND SHOULD BE SOLD FOR NO LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE NO LESS. THAN THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE BASED ON THE ACTUAL PARCELS TO BE INCLUDED THE SALE THAT THAT'S BASED ON THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THANK YOU ARE ALSO ASKING ABOUT UNDER EXISTING LOT TODAY IF THEY CHOSE NOT TO EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL WHAT RIGHTS TO THEY HAPPENED I I CAN'T. SPEAK TO THAT EXCEPT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE IT OKAY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL OUT SO SO BASICALLY THEY THEY HAVE A PROCEDURE THAT. DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE INTERNALLY ABOUT THE WAY THEY DISPOSE OF THEIR LAND OUR USUAL AS THEIR LAND OR A YOU KNOW TURN IT INTO A AS WE ARE A AND AND THIS JUST THIS GIVES THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY. SIMPLY GETS IN THE OPTION IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO GO FORWARD WITH THEIR PLANS TO EXPAND THE PARK. GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL IT FOR OPEN SPACE FOR PURPOSES AND IT WOULDN'T IMPACT THE CURRENT. RECREATIONAL USE. THAT'S HAPPENING NOW AS I SAID THE EXISTING OFF HIGHWAY PARK ISN'T TO AFFECT IT AT ALL BY THIS BILL. AND THIS BILL DOES ENFORCE ANYTHING JUST GIVE THEM AN OPTION OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. EVERY OTHER DISCUSSION THEIR MOTION -- BY SENATOR HILL. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR JUST IN CLOSING THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION IN PREVIOUS YEARS THANK YOU FOR THAT.

IT UTILIZES A DIGITAL DICTIONARY OR TAXONOMY FOR CLASSIFICATIONS IN TERMS. PDF'S ARE DIFFICULT TO TRANSFER INTO AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET. IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE MAKING COMPUTER READING OF FINANCIALS LABOR INTENSIVE. I XPERIA IS LIKE TAGGING THE WEBSITE. YOU CAN SEARCH TERMS INSTANTLY YOU CAN ALSO COMPARE CAPPERS COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL PORTS IN SECONDS VERSUS HOURS. THIS SUFFICIENT MONEY SAVING TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY IN USE AROUND THE GLOBE. IN THE U. S. THE SEC REQUIRES AT SIX THOUSAND PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS TO REPORT WITH IT. THE FDIC DOES THE SAME FOR EIGHT THOUSAND BANKS AUSTRALIA HAS ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN ONE BILLION IN COST SAVINGS WITH ITS MUNICIPALITIES. AND THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR MILLION RESIDENTS. THERE ARE NO LICENSING FEES IT'S NOT SOFTWARE IT'S A STANDARD IT ADOPTS TO REPORTING ADAPTS USE ME. TOO REPORTING AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES IS [inaudible] I'M SORRY. SENATOR GLAZER HAS ALSO REQUESTED TO BE A CO AUTHOR IT FIVE MAKE TAKE AMENDMENTS AND HOPEFULLY I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE VOTE RIGHT AWAY I KEEP GOING. DAHLE SCRATCHES NAY MOCK -- ARE ALSO GETTING A GOOD FEEDBACK FROM TREASURE FIANNA MáS OFFICE. THIS IS WHY CONVERTING CAMERAS THAT HAVE. FILM TO DIGITAL WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT'S THE FUTURE AND WE NEED TO CATCH UP ESPECIALLY AS A HIGH TECH STATE. ONCE IT'S IMPLEMENTED OUR CITIES BONDHOLDERS RATING AENCIES AND TAXPAYERS WILL WONDER. WHAT TOOK US SO LONG -- COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY -- I AND I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT AND I HAVE A WITNESS MISTER DIXON RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK STRIDE THANK YOU. FIRST OFF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ON SB. FIVE NINETY EIGHT THE DECISION TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE THE XP ARE ALL STANDARDS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I MYSELF AM ACTIVE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND I PROVIDE INFO A CREDIT. TO VARIOUS ENTITIES AND I RELY ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND WE CURRENTLY USE THE XP ARE ALL FOR ALL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. OUR UNDERWRITERS CAN IMPORT THAT INFORMATION AND SO IT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND IS ALREADY BEING USED. I AM ALSO INVOLVED IN AN EFFORT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO EXPAND THE TAXONOMY TO INCLUDE THE DATA FIELDS NECESSARY FOR BUILDING ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND RECENTLY EXPANDED THE TAXONOMY BY OVER FIVE THOUSAND DATA ELEMENTS. TO BRING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FINANCING AND WHATNOT TO MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. MANY OF WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY MUNICIPAL BONDS WERE BY GREEN BOND FUNDS. THIRTY IS A FINANCIAL GUARANTEE WE LIVE ON THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE THE BETTER THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE A MORE ACCURATE IT IS THE BETTER WE CAN DO OUR JOBS. SO PROVIDING THE DIGITAL INFORMATION AS A SENATORS MENTIONED ALLOWS FOR THAT CAPABILITY. AND I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THAT HAS GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR FINANCIAL IMPACT TOWARDS EFFICIENCY. THE CASF REPORTING ALSO GENERATES. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NEW EMERGING FAN TEX CONSTRUCTED SURE TECH AND ALL THE VARIOUS NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. THOSE NEW TOOLS AND RESOURCES WILL HAVE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. DATE INTERRUPT ABILITY TO THE PUBLIC AGENCIES AND THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE A BIG SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AS WELL. AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERING VIEWS ON ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PRIORITY POLICIES. I WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THERE IS A CONSISTENT VIEW THAT EFFICIENCY IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE. AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU. SUPPORT SB FIVE NINETY EIGHT AND ALLOW THAT EFFICIENCY TO TAKE HOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH LEADS THE NATION. THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT -- THEIR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE THE STATE FACES CRITICAL POSTSECONDARY CHALLENGES INCLUDING RISING COSTS CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AN INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES. NO SEGMENT OR GOVERNING BODY IS CHARGED WITH ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES IN WHOLE. NOW MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIME SINCE THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WAS CHARTERED THE STATE NEEDS EXPERT LEADERSHIP TO SUPPORT EQUITABLE COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WHILE THE SEGMENTS HAVE MADE IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES AND HIGHER EDUCATION SUCH AS AFFORDABILITY. ACCESS TIME TO DEGREE FUNDAMENTALLY THESE ARE STATEWIDE PROBLEMS THAT TRANSCEND ANY ONE INSTITUTION OR SEGMENT AND THEY REQUIRE SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS. THE OFFICE ESTABLISHED BY SB THREE COULD TAKE A STATE WIE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ISSUES SUCH AS INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND SUPPORTING CROSS SECTOR INITIATIVES SUCH AS DUAL ENROLLMENT IN TRANSFER PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY SB THREE CREATED INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEVELOP STATEWIDE HIGHER EDUCATION GOALS TO OVERSEE INTER AGENCY EFFORTS AND TO PROMOTE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING BY USING DATA. ACROSS EDUCATION AND WORK FOR CENTER IS FURTHER SB THREE CAREFULLY THINGS THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE ROLES OF KEY STAKE HOLDERS CREATING ADVISORY BOARD WITH STUDENT AND SEGMENT REPRESENTATIVES.

THAT CENTERS ON THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SB THREE THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES THERE ARE SEE DIRECTOR OF POLICY NOW ADVOCACY WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY.

I'D LIKE TO THINK SENATORS ALLEN IN GLACIER FOR THE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB. THREE WE KNOW THAT IN THE COMING YEARS THE STATE WILL NEED A GROWING SUPPLY OF EDUCATED WORKERS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF AYE DYNAMICS -- STATE ECONOMY AND THAT KEY TO FOR FILLING THIS NEED WILL BE ENSURING THE ACCESS AND SUCCESS OF THOSE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER REPRESENTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. YET CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY STANDS AS ONLY ONE OF TWO STATES WITHOUT A STATEWIDE COORDINATING BODY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. MEANING WE LACKED THE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION THAT POSITIONS THE STATE TO MEET THESE CALLENGES. A BODY THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY ONE SECTOR SEGMENT BUT RATHER UNDERSTANDS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE STATE AND CAN FACILITATE THE NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS. ANALYSIS AND EXPERTISE TOWARDS THESE GOALS. SB THREE RECOGNIZES THIS CRITICAL VOID AND ESTABLISH A STATE LEADERSHIP POSITION TO CONFRONT THESE CHALLENGES AND FOR THOSE REASONS. WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I WILL. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION OH SORRY -- HIS ABOUT SORT IN SEAT BEHIND. A HANNAH RAKKESTAD WITH THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SEE NONE TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] CENTER NIELSEN.

THAT WAS A THREE YEAR EFFORT BY A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND A JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE -- I WORKED WITH SENATOR VASCONCELOS. AND THE MISSION GOALS IN IN RELATIONSHIPS OF THE THREE LEVELS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WERE. I GUESS I WOULD SAY CONTEMPORARY RISE DOOR MADE MORE CLEAR BY VIRTUE OF THAT REVIEW. NOW AND CREATING THIS ENTITY. WILL THIS IN ANY LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REQUIRE THEM TO BE GUIDED BY THE MASTER PLAN IN PLACE SO THAT THEY CAN'T JUST GO REINVENT THE MASTER PLAN ON THEIR OWN. THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE PURVIEW OF THE LEGISLATURE SOLELY. THERE ARE I WOULD CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE ALONG SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EXPRESS THAT. TO GUIDED BY THE MASTER PLAN ARE.

IN YOUR ANALYSIS ON PAGE FIVE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW -- HOW THE MASTER PLAN CREATED SEE BACK AS AN OVERSIGHT BODY AND HOW IT SAW THE THE NEED FOR COORDINATION AND AND AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BODIES?

ATTENDED ZERO THE BILLS ON TEN ZERO SO THE BILLS OUT THE WE'LL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON TO THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO ITEM THREE SB. THREE FIFTY TWO I BELIEVE THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. AARON MEMBERS SB THREE RIGHT THREE FIVE TWO WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF A.. ALCOHOL BEVERAGE COMMISSION TO ISSUE UP. TO TEN NEW TYPE FORTY SEVEN LICENSES IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE REACHED THE CURRENT LIMIT OF ALCOHOL LICENSES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CURRENT LAW PLACES A LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF ON SALE GENERAL LICENSES. TO WHAT LICENSE FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THAT COUNTY. WELL THIS SYSTEM CERTAINLY WORKS FOR MOST THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTIES WHERE THE DEMAND -- FOR LICENSES FAR OUTWEIGHS THE CURRENT NUMBER. HE NAPA COUNTY FOR INSTANCE THE POPULATION IS LOW THAT'S THE NUMBER OF LICENSED IS AS WELL HOWEVER BECAUSE OF TOURISM IN THE DEMAND FOR RESTAURANTS. WHO SERVE ALCOHOL IS MUCH HIGHER -- THIS IS IMPORTANT HE INDIVIDUALS HOPING TO OPEN A RESTAURANT IN THOSE COUNTIES ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE OPEN MARKET. WE'RE LICENSES CAN COST UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN OBSTACLE THAT MANY CANNOT OVERCOME. THIS RESULT IN THE LOSS OF REVENUES TO OUR CITIES IN OUR STATE NOT TO MENTION A LOTS OF JOBS FOR COMMUNITIES. AS EMAIL SUSPENSIONS THE THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO TYPE FORTY SEVEN LICENSES WHICH ARE MORE COMMONLY USED TO OPEN RESTAURANTS. LICENSES FROM BEING SOLD FOR MORE THAN THEY ARE PURCHASED -- PURCHASED WHICH SHOULD DIMINISH -- THE IMPACT ON CURRENT LICENSES MEMBERS AT A TIME MORE DEMAND FOR RESTAURANTS IS AN ALL TIME HIGH IT IS TIME FOR US TO RE EVALUATE HOW THE STATE ISSUES THESE LICENSES. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A STEP FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS PAT CHOICE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PAT CHOICE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY -- TWENTY TWO HUNDRED EATING ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB THREE FIFTY TWO A WELL BOUNCE MEASURE THAT WOULD PERMIT NO MORE THAN TEN OR TEN NEW ORIGINAL ON STILL GENERAL LICENSES PER YEAR FOR RESTAURANTS AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE REACHED. THE LIMIT ON ON SALE JOURNAL LICENSES -- WHY THE NEED FOR THE BILL? THE DEMAND FOR ON SALE OUT THE WHOLE LICENSES HAS EXCEEDED THE CAP ON SUCH LICENSES MANY POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATIONS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO NAPA A LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY IN SAN DIEGO. RESULTED IN EXPENSIVE ONLINE -- ON SALE LICE'S CREATE A BARRIER OF ENTRY. FOR SOMEONE TRYING TO OPEN A NEW RESTAURANT. THE BARRIER TO ENTRY SLOWS DOWN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION LOCAL ECONOMIES. SB THREE FIFTY TWO ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF NEW ORIGINAL ON SALE LICENSES PER YEAR FOR BONAFIDE EATING PLACES ONLY. SO THEY CAN ONLY BE USED TO OPEN UP. A NEW RESTAURANTS. LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESTAURANT ELEMENT. THE EMPLOYEES THAT COME WITH THAT INVESTMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED SALES TAX DOLLARS THAT WILL BE GENERATED FROM THESE LOCATIONS LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. WHICH WILL STIMULATE LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMIT THE NUMBER OF NEW LICENSES WITHIN A GIVEN COUNTY. AND HELP FOSTER SYSTEM OF OF INCENTIVES THAT ACTUALLY. USE THESE LICENSES FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHER REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU GOT ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THREE NINE IN IN OPPOSITION. SEEING THEM PULL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN --TURNED OUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN A BIT FURTHER ON THE DYNAMIC OF A THESE LICENSES -- ESCALATE IN PRICE AND CREATE THIS KIND OF BIZARRE MARKET FOR FOR THEM HE'S GOING TO GO ON A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. YEAH SURE A BABY IS CLEARLY JUST A SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE -- PEOPLE NEED ALCOHOL LICENSES IF THEY'RE GOING TO OPERATE A RESTAURANT PARTICULARLY IN THE HEAVILY TOURIST AREA OR YELLOWING IN JUST IN THE CULINARY. HIGHER QUALITY OR ACTUALLY ANY CULINARY EVEN AT SO YOU HAVE VERY FEW LICENSES HIGH DEMAND THE PRICES PRICE JUST GOES UP AND IT IS GONE UP AND UP AND UP. YOU OVER THE YEARS -- MA'AM WE'VE TRIED TO BAD DATE APPROACHES ONE OF THEM WOULD BE A TYPE SEVENTY FIVE LICENSE PEOPLE BREWING BEER BUT WE FOUND OUT CENTER BRADFORD HAD A BILL LAST YEAR. WE FOUND OUT THAT -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE JUST. YEAH BREWING BEER TO GET THE ALCOHOL LICENSE AND IT JUST IT REALLY WASN'T WORKING AND WE WERE HAVING. IF FOR SOME ISSUES THERE AND SO THIS SEEM TO BE THE BEST STEP FORWARD. ONE DEFINITELY SUPPORTIVE I THINK ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP OUT THE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A FOOD COMPONENT -- IN PRINCIPALLY THESE ARE RESTAURANTS THAT ARE SERVING ALCOHOL NOT BARS -- ABSOLUTELY HELPED INDUSTRIES OUT. VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU SIR BORDER SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU SHARE MISTER DOT I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE BILL AS WELL AND AS FACT -- YOU KNOW ANYWHERE TO GO A STEP FORWARD FARTHER. RIGHT CAN'T MAYBE WE CAN DO LATER THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW IT JUST REMOVE THE CAP IN IT IT'S IT STIFLES INNOVATION IT -- IT SERVES AS A ROADBLOCK FOR NEW PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY.

THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT [inaudible] ROBOTICS AUTOMATION THREATS TO THE WORK FORCE CHANGES IN THE WORKPLACE -- BUT AT THIS POINT B. ANALYSIS DRIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STRATEGY IS BORROWED NATIONAL IN SCOPE LACKS REGIONAL GRANULARITY WE TRULY DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE RISKS REALLY ARE -- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE -- AND AT THIS POINT IS A LOT OF CONJECTURE DRIVING BOTH OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AGENDA -- WHEN IT COMES TO AUTOMATION AS WELL AS OUR OUR FUTURE PLANNING FOR THIS EONOMY THIS BILL IS HOPEFULLY DESIGNED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED HIS FUTURE WORK COMMISSION -- IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE AND THIS BILL WOULD PUT. A LEGISLATIVE BATCHES CODIFICATION BUT LEGISLATIVE VOICE INTO THAT COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT WERE INFORMED BY THE ANALYSES BUT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE THE PROCESS -- AS WELL I IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR -- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I MEAN WE ARE WE KNOW SOME OF THE STATISTICS 50% I THINK OF THE WORK FORCE MACKENZIE ESTIMATES IS SUSCEPTIBLE THE AUTOMATION OVER. THE NEXT PERIOD OF TIME -- 5% OF OCCUPATIONS COULD BE FULLY AUTOMATED BY EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES ACCORDING TO MACKENZIE BUT AGAIN WE DO NOT WANT FEAR OR DOUBT TO DRY THIS AUTOMATION CONVERSATION WE WANT NUMBERS AND DATA TO DRIVE THIS STATE AND SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE BEHIND THIS BILL WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. AND LOOK FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY I'M SORRY I'M HERE WITH MATT HORTON ON BEHALF OF THE MILKEN NSTITUTE IT WAS DID BEEN DOING A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT HOUSES SOME IT'S CENTER. ALL UP THANK YOU CENTERS ARE MEMBERS. SHARE COME UP AS CENTER SAID ON MATT HORTON I AM REPRESENTING THE MILKEN INSTITUTE CENTER FOR REGIONAL ECONOMICS. THE MILKEN INSTITUTE IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ECONOMIC POLICY THINK TANK. AND IN OUR WORK IN IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF WORK -- IN PREPARING CALIFORNIA FOR THE FUTURE WORK WE BELIEVE IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE LEVERAGE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS INCREASE NEW LINKS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND EDUCATION LEADERS. THESE CONNECTIONS SHOULD BE THE FOCUS ON CULTIVATING A PIPELINE THAT SUPPORTS NIBBLE UPSCALING PROGRAMS FOR WORKERS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR CAREERS AND FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRY NEEDS. A COMMON THEME RESIN FOR MORE WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR WORKERS TO BE QUIPPED WITH THE SKILLS THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS COMPUTER LITERACY -- AS WELL AS TRADITIONAL SKILLS AND COMMUNICATION A MANAGEMENT THAT CANNOT BE OFFSET BY AUTOMATION -- AS SENATOR STATED AND AND AN OVERVIEW AUTOMATION SECTOR THE UPSET OR DISRUPT AROUND 50% OF THE U. S. JOBS BY -- TWENTY FORTY IT IS ALSO EXPECTED -- TO CREATE THE NEED FOR MORE EMPLOYEES TO CONTINUOUSLY LEARN OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR CAREERS -- AS TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATES THE SPEED AT WHICH INDUSTRIES CHANGE -- FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE THINK -- IN ORDER TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO BRING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO DISCUSS AREAS OF CONCERN OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION -- A STATE COMMISSION COULD BE THE FIRST STEP IN ENSURING CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND WORKERS ARE PREPARE FOR THIS NEXT ITERATION OF JOBS -- IN PREPARING CALIFORNIA FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK WE CAN RE AFFIRM THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR NEW GENERATION. PROVIDING BY FOR ANY GREATER ACCESS -- TO EQUITABLE SKILLS -- AND TECHNOLOGY IN SOFT SKILLS THAT ARE ALSO NECESSARY THROUGHOUT INVOLVING QUIRK LANDSCAPE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESSES SUPPORT. DROUGHT COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE BILL IF AMENDED. WE KNOW THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES WILL BE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY -- DUE TO CHANGES IN -- THE WORKPLACE DUE TO AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY SO WE'RE SEEKING IS INSTEAD OF ONE PRIVATE SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES TO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DIFFERENT SECTORS ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED. CAMERA DIMITRI WITH TECHNO AND NOW WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MR CHEN MEMBERS MATTHEW ALL OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO HAVE A SUPPORT OF HIM IN A POSITION ON THE BILL.

ARE PUT A PROHIBITION ON ON NOT. THE THE WHAT WAS THE AUTOMATE YOU COULDN'T USE THE MONEY. TO USE AT IT COULD BE INVOLVED IN ANY AUTOMATION ABOUT THAT WE GAVE MONEY BUT SAID YOU COULD USE IT FOR AUTOMATION. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR IN THIS SPACE AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK TO TRY TO GET IN FRONT OF THIS SO WE CAN MAKE GOOD CHOICES DOWN THE LINE CENTER JONES. THANK YOU I THINK I SUPPORT YOUR BILL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA I'M I'M I'M. ALWAYS HESITANT -- TO DEVELOP A NEW COMMISSION -- THAT'S JUST KIND OF MY NATURAL BEND BUT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN. LOOKING AT MY NOTES THAT -- THE COMMISSION OF EIGHT MEMBERS MANDATES THAT ONLY ONE MEMBER. BE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS THAT ACCURATE. IT IS THE ONLY REAL GRANULARITY WE HAVE IN THE BILL IN TERMS OF WHO REPRESENTS WHO IS ONE MEMBER FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND ONE MEMBER FROM LABOR. THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF CAN'T SORT OF GRANULARITY IN THE MEASURE RIGHT NOW I'M VERY OPEN -- TO IDEAS ON EITHER EXPANDING TO MULTIPLESECTORS AND GETTING REALLY SPECIFIC -- AND INTENSELY EVEN EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE BOARD ALTHOUGH YOU GET INTO A A PLACE FOR YOU KNOW DECISION MAKING GETS COMPLICATED DEPENDING ON HOW BIG IT GETS. BUT IT'S IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR ONE PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBER OR WHAT ONE SECTOR OF THE LABOR ECONOMY FRANKLY A TEAMSTERS GONNA HAVE VERY DIFFERENT INTERESTS THAN SAY A NURSE OR A OR A LONGSHOREMANRIGHT SO. I THINK WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK THAT WE CAN COVER THOSE MULTIPLE SECTORS AYE AYE IT'S A VALID CONCERN. AND I'M I'M OPEN TO IDEAS OKAY SO YOUR VISION IS TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT YOU'RE INCLUDING IN THE BILL THAT. AT LEAST ONE PURCHASE AGAIN AND I YOU KNOW YOU FOR YOUR TIME ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK YOU KNOW. MOST EMPLOYEES STILL IN CALIFORNIA WORK FOR IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THAT'S A LARGE MARGIN I WOULD. JUST ENCOURAGES IT MOVES DOWN THE ROAD TO MAYBE. EXPAND THAT MANDATE IN THE BILL SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO THERE CHIANG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL -- IT THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF FEAR REGARDING AUTOMATION AND I'VE BEEN. TELLING A LOT OF FOLKS I JUST DIDN'T POP CHALLENGE WITH KIDS AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO GET IN FRONT OF THIS. BE THE CREATORS OF THE TECHNOLOGY NOT JUST THE CONSUMERS I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO ADDRESS THE TRAINING. ASPECT AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER -- COMMISSION MEMBERSHIP OF FROM THE FROM ACADEMIA -- OR SOME TRAINING THAT INCORPORATES SOME TRAINING ASPECT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S I THINK THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS SO THAT WE CAN ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE FEAR -- BUT WITH THAT I I DO WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR FOR THIS BILL I THINK THIS IS. THIS IS GREAT TO START DRESSING THIS ISSUE THANK CENTER. WHAT HAPPENED TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION ABSOLUTELY? OKAY IN ANY OTHER COMMENTS -- SIR STERN YOU DID IT -- YOU YOU HAVEN'T SAID IT YET BUT I NEED YOU -- TO I'M EXCEPT IMMENSELY AMENDMENTS ABSOLUTELY AND I AND I WILL IN THE PRESENTATION THE NEXT I THINK IS IMPORTANT COMMENT ABOUT HOW THIS COMMISSION MIGHT RELATE TO ANOTHER COMMISSION WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT BUT I'LL RESERVE THAT FOR THE NEXT DISCUSSION WITH THAT MAY HAVE A MOTION. MOTION SENATOR ARCHULETA WE CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. FILE ITEM ELEVEN AS BE SEVEN THIRTY MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE DOT. HI DODD I WILK HI WILK AYE ALLEN ARCHULETA. ARCHULETA HI GORGEOUS. GORGEOUS I BRADFORD. CHANG CHANG AYE GALGIANI GALGIANI AYE GLAZER. GLAZER AYE HILL. HILL AYE HUESO. JONES JONES I NIELSEN I NIELSEN AYE PORTANTINO [inaudible] RUBIO. RUBIO AYE WIENER. VERY GOOD ELEVEN IS THERE ARE LOTS OF IN THE BILL'S ON CALL -- THAT WOULD MOVED ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SB [inaudible] SEVEN FIVE TWO VERY GOOD -- I'M A VERY MILLENNIAL I'M GETTING A CALL ON MY WATCH I FEEL LIKE DICK TRACY APPEAR -- IN A THAT'S A VERY NON MILLENNIAL REFERENCE SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE ANACHRONISTIC AYE YEAH -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT. ANOTHER CHALLENGING ISSUE IN THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE WHICH GOES BEYOND JUST THE FUTURE OF WORK IN WHAT AUTOMATION COULD DO TO OUR WORK FORCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE SPEED OF INNOVATION WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGES IN SOCIAL MEDIA -- AND OUR BROADER TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE. WE FEEL IS OUTPACING OUR ABILITY TO TO TO NOT JUST TO REGULATE BUT TO TRULY COMPREHEND IS PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS AND HIS GOVERNMENT -- THE THE IMPACT OF BROADLY PROLIFERATED SOCIAL MEDIA ON OUR DEMOCRACY. ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH -- ON THE WAY WE GO ABOUT OUR DAILY LIVES I DON'T THINK IS FULLY UNDERSTOOD I KNOW WE WILL BE WRESTLING WITH MANY ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY -- AND HOW CONSUMERS INTERACT WITH -- THEY'RE SORT OF THESE DATA PLATFORMS THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE A CONCEPT OF A DATED DIVIDENDS -- THIS BILL TRIES TO SORT OF SCOPE OUT A BROADER APPROACH WHERE CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER SENSE. OF WHAT THE TRUE IMPACTS OF THE SPEED AND SCALE OF INNOVATION ARE THAT WE'VE SEEN. AS A SOCIAL MATTER SO NOT JUST IMPACTS ON WORKFORCE. BUT TRULY THE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES ON THE VALUE OF THE DATA THAT WERE SENDING -- TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED TO TARGET ADS OR TO GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE -- WHAT'S HAPPENING. TO YOUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS AS THEY USE INSTAGRAM FOR NINETEEN HOURS A DAY AND LIVE THEIR LIVES IN THIS PARADIGM THAT IS TRULY IMPACTING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE ANOTHER -- AS WELL AS WITH DEMOCRACY -- NOT JUST A YOUNG PERSON ISSUE THOUGH FAKE NEWS LAST CYCLE I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY WAS SHARED BY THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. HI THIS IS NOT JUST MILLENNIALS IGNORANTLY WANDERING THROUGH THE WEB. SO THE GUY IDEA HERE IS TO FORM SOME KIND OF COMMISSION TO BRING BOTH -- THE TOP ACADEMICS -- THE TOP ECONOMISTS FOLKS FROM PRIVATE SECTOR BUT ALSO CONSUMER AND PRIVACY ADVOCATES TO TRY TO DEVELOP SOME STRATEGY TO LOOK AT WHAT AN EQUITY STAKE FROM THE TECH COMMUNITY REALLY LOOKS LIKE. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO JUST SAY. YOU CAN OFFSET THE IMPACT YOU MAY HAVE HAD ON JOURNALISM ON DEMOCRACY THROUGH CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OR THROUGH SOME OTHER -- STUDIES ARE REPORTS SIR EVEN THE WONDERFUL EVENTS WE DO OUR WE WE CODE IN THE DISTRICTS ARE WE HELP EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT -- THE THE PITFALLS OF SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S THAT'S NOT ENOUGH -- WE ACTUALLY NEED TO LOOK AT A SITTING DOWN THE TECH COMMUNITY WHAT AN EQUITY STAKE REALLY LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE ANYTHING THAT STARTS WITH ACCOUNTING DATA AND HAVE AN ACCURATE SET OF FACTS ABOUT. WHAT THESE IMPACTS COULD TRULY BE SO -- THIS IS SORT OF TAKING THAT BALL AND RUNNING WITH IT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE AND TRY TO EXPAND UPON THAT TO NOT JUST BE ABOUT A DATA DIVIDEND CONVERSATION BUT SOMETHING MUCH BROADER THAT WE THINK COULD. TRY PUBLIC POLICY IN YEARS TO COME. I'VE GOT HERE THIS BUSY UGLIES HERE FROM COMMON SENSE MEDIA THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND HELPING US ALONG WITH THIS MEASURE -- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU CENTER STERN CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ELIZABETH POLICIA I AM VICE PRESIDENT POLICY FOR COMMON SENSE. WE ARE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ADVOCATING FOR HEALTHY DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM. WE REPRESENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION PARENTS FAMILIES STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS ACROSS THE NATION WHO WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THEY CAN HARNESS THE POWER OF MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING AND LIFE. THEY WANT THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTED THEY WANT TO CONNECT WITH FRIENDS WITH JOBS WITH THE WORLD AND THEY WANT A VIBRANT FUTURE. THE SAME KIDS AND FAMILIES FEEL THEY'RE PART OF A GRAND EXPERIMENT THE INNOVATION ECONOMY IS ONE IN WHICH WE ARE TESTING DISRUPTING AND IN THE END FAILING OUR NEXT GENERATIONS. AND IT'S NOW TIME TO INNOVATE FOR CHANGE. AND I QUOTE. IT IS NO LONGER MORALLY ACCEPTABLE FOR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO SAY WE JUST CREATE THE PLATFORMS HOW PEOPLE USE THEM IS UP TO THEM. THAT IS MORALLY INDEFENSIBLE IT IS GOOD COP OUT AND IS HURTING CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND SOCIETY AT LARGE. THESE WORDS ARE FROM THE NINETEENTH SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES VACHE MARTY. A FEW WEEKS AGO IN WASHINGTON DC. THE NATION'S DOCTOR FOR FOUR YEARS WHO CHALLENGE THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT TO TURN THE TIDE ON THE OPIOID CRISIS. CONTINUED IN THOSE COMMENTS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS ASK OURSELVES WHAT THE IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON? OUR ON THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO SERVE. PART OF THAT INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING AND INVESTING IN THAT IMPACT AND THE COURAGE TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION IF WE SEE THERE MAY BE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. EVEN IF THAT IMPACTS OUR PROFIT WE HAVE TO FUNCTION WITH AN ETHIC THAT PEOPLE AND THEIR WELL BEING COME FIRST. AND GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A ROLE BY CONVENING THE RIGHT PLAYERS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND PLACING THIS HIGH ON OUR NATIONAL AGENDA. CALIFORNIA WITH THE TECH EQUITY ACT IS DOING JUST THAT. ELEVATING HOW TECH IMPACTS SOCIETY HI ON THE NATIONAL AGENDA. PRIVACY A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITY. AROUND TECHNOLOGY USE JUSTICE AN IMPACT. AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY WELL CRITICAL IS ONLY THE THE BEGINNING OF ADDRESSING EQUITY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THE TECH EQUITY ACT WE HOPE TO EXPLORE TAX IMPACT ON ANY QUALITY. OUR KIDS FUTURE THE FUTURE OF A FREE PRESS AND TAX IMPACT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS WORK WILL HAPPEN BY ENGAGING COMMUNITIES IN SECTORS THAT ARE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE AND THAT HAVE AN WITH THOSE THAT HAVE THE MOST AT STAKE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO REALIZE A JUST AND EQUITABLE TECH FUTURE FOR ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WITNESSES OPPOSITION. TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU WELL I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STAFFED I AS AN EDUCATOR FOR SO MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT DOWN. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES AS TEACHERS ON NOT GOING UP IN THE TECHNOLOGY ERA THERE WERE NOT UNDERSTANDING IN THE CLASSROOM THE IMPACTS OF PARENT TEACHER. ANYHOW I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITH THIS IS IMPORTANT IN PARTICULAR AS IT PERTAINS TO OUR STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO HOPEFULLY WE GET SOME DATA ON HOW THAT AFFECTS. OUR CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO RUBIO CAN I COUNT THAT AS A OCEAN [inaudible] SIR WORKS. WE'RE USING THE THE TERM EQUITIES AND INEQUITIES. WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT? DOES THAT MEAN. I WE IS THIS A SYNONYM FOR TAXATION. RESEARCH. I DO I DON'T THINK SO I I I THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY AND THE INDUSTRY'S DRIVING IT -- CAN TAKE AN EQUITY STAKE IN THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT STARTS WITH ACCOUNTING -- AND SORT OF UNDERSTANDING. THE IF IT'S POSSIBLE WE WE MAY NOT GET TO A PERFECT ACCOUNTING OF SOCIAL COST HERE -- IT'S NOT THE SAME SAY IS A CARBON PRICING EXERCISE WHERE YOU CAN. GET DOWN TO THE EXACT DOLLAR PER TON EQUIVALENT. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY YET FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY'RE NOT SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM US BUT THEY ARE US AND I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE MEANING BEHIND THE EQUITY POINT IS THAT -- HEY THEY DON'T EXIST JUST IN THE CLOUD THEY'RE NOT JUST A PLATFORM -- THEY'RE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY LIVE HERE. HOUSING THE WORK FORCE -- THEY OUGHT TO EXERCISE SOME EQUITY STAKE IN WHAT THAT IS AND NOW I'M I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE -- TAXATION ORIENTED MEASURE PER SE -- I THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S A BROADER FRAMEWORK TO ALLOW OURSELVES ACTUALLY INTEGRATE -- THOSE COMMUNITIES IMPACTS INTO OUR FUTURE PLANNING OF WE KNOW THAT THE 85% OF FAKE NEWS ARE BEING SHARED BY THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING. EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES AGAIN I THINK A LOT OF FEAR DRIVES OUR CONVERSATION AROUND TECH AND THAT SORT OF THE RELATION BACK TO THE FUTURE WORK -- WE ARE SPECULATING RIGHT NOW AND A LOT OF THE BLOW UPS THAT WE SEEN OVER LAST COUPLE YEARS IN TERMS OF THE USE OF FACEBOOK -- IT'S IMPACT ON JOURNALISM -- I STILL BELIEVE IN A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET AND I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS IS TO SHUT DOWN FACEBOOK OR TO GO -- TAX GOOGLE BECAUSE THE CURRENT PARADIGM IS SIMPLY NOT WORKING. IN I THINK YOU'RE HITTING ON SOME REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS I THINK. THE TECH DYNAMIC IN ITS EVERYDAY IMPACT OUR LIVES WERE CERTAINLY HAVING TO CALIBRATE RECALIBRATE -- AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END IN SIGHT BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS A STEP OR TWO AHEAD OF US. I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN BY THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION LIKE THIS. THAT. IT WOULD. THE FIRST A CALCULATION ON IMPACT. AND THE MOTIVATION TO CREATE NEW FUNDING STREAMS WILL BE SO OVERWHELMING IN SEDUCTIVE. THAT. IT'S AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS -- WITH ITS OWN CONCLUSION. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE OUT OF THE FUTURE OF THIS AREA OF REGULATION AND I AND I THINK THE TECH MEANS ACTUALLY ASKING FOR THAT REGULATION TO SOME EXTENT THEY'RE SAYING PLEASE HELP US THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WE AS POLICY MAKERS ACTUALLY NEED. TO GET OUR HANDS AROUND THIS. IT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU THINK IT IS -- THE FUTURE OF A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN ORGANIZE PARTIES SAY -- CONSUMERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEIR ABILITY TO SAY THIS IS HOW MUCH VALUE FOR INSTANCE FOR PROVIDING DO YOU FACE BOOK -- NOT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN BE INTERESTED IN TAXING YOU BUT HOW TO SAY EMPOWER -- YOU THOSE THOSE SORT OF DATA CONTRIBUTORS TO HAVE THEIR OWN NEGOTIATION WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM NEW CONSTRUCTS THAT. I I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE IN OUR LEXICON AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF TAXATION REGULATION BECAUSE THIS. THIS NEW PARADIGM IS SO UNPRECEDENTED -- I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A STRAIGHT STALKING HORSE FOR YOU KNOW A DIGITAL SERVICES TAX OR SOME SOME DIFFERENT KIND OF TEXT TAX THAT LIKE THERE WITH WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE U. K. THE U. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOME DIFFERENT HERE INCALIFORNIA SO. I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE SOME MORE GRANULAR BUT I GOTTA GET PEOPLE MUCH SMARTER THAN MYSELF -- TOGETHER WITH THE BEST PEOPLE -- THAT THE GOVERNOR CAN COME UP WITH AND HOPEFULLY YOU WALKING I'M OF COME UP WITH AND DO SOME ANALYSIS HERE BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN THINK WE HAVE THE MECHANISMS IN MIND YET LET ALONE THE ACCOUNTING. IF THAT HELPS CAN'T STUDY WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE THERE YOU GO -- THANK YOU YES -- CHIANG. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION ANYONE FROM THE TECH COMMUNITY THAT'S SUPPOSED. I DON'T I THINK THIS IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW I THINK WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT -- I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY. ON EITHER SIDE PRIVACY OR TECH SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OTHER THAN THE SYSTEMS OF OF COMMON SENSE AT THIS POINT [inaudible] YEAH. A WE HAVE A MOTION ON THAT YET.

CENTER THIS BILL -- ENJOYS THE THE CHAIR SUPPORT. I SAW MANY ASK YOU IN THE VICE CHAIRS BOTH SIDES SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU IN YOUR WITH THIS IS TO BE BRIEF WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SIX SIX NINE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE SAFE DRINKING WATER FUND AND SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST -- AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT. ARE. CHRONICALLY FAILING TO SERVE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND A MAJORITY OF THEM ARE IN SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS. ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES A LOT OF IN MINE -- SO TO GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD SET UP A BOMB IT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES. THAT WAS WE HAVE WE HAVE WATER IN THE BOND. WE HAVE MANY IN THE IN THE WATER BOND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS SUMS TO SOME OF THESE WATER SYSTEMS BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED. IS A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO ASSIST THE STRUGGLING PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS WHICH GENERALLY CANNOT BE FINANCED WITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE SAFE DRINKING WATER FIND SOURCES. SO THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS THE GAP IN FUNDING AT THE STATE BY CREATING THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST WHICH WOULD BE CREATED AT THE STATE TREASURY AND FINANCE WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR. LIKE THIS -- THE TRUSTS PRINTABLE WOULD BE INVESTED AND THE NET INCOME WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER FIND AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE SYSTEM FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES.
