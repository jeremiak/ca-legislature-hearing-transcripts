GOOD MORNING SENATOR SCRIPTS EVERYBODY AND YEAH I LIKE THAT THE START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN AND WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION AND THIS IS A BILL THAT PROPOSES GREAT NEW PROGRAM- BUT PROGRAM TO REPURPOSE IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL LAND HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SIGMA'S. AS GROUNDWATER BECOMES LESS AVAILABLE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IRRIGATED LAND INCLUDING A. HALF A MILLION ACRES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ALONE WILL HAVE TO COME OUT ABOUT CULTURAL- SOME PRODUCTION AND UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS INEVITABLE AT THIS POINT. AND SO WITHOUT A PLAN OR A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS SIGNAL RELATED REDUCTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL WATER USE AND SUBSEQUENT FOLLOWING OF A FARMLAND IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BECOME AN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RESULTING HOT SPOTS OF DUST AND WEEDS AND INVASIVE PESTS THAT WILL IN TURN DRAG DOWN OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES. AND IMPACT AIR QUALITY AND- BOB FIVE SOME BOOK BUT THE HUSKIES ME THE PILOT WOULD. THAT BIO THE- THIS LEGISLATION WILL INSTEAD. IT SURE THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THIS ISSUE MORE STRATEGICALLY- BY WORKING TO REPURPOSE IDLE THERE FOLLOWED LAND. IN WAYS THAT- THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT. FOR PURPOSES LIKE HABITAT RESTORATION GROUNDWATER RECHARGE OR CATTLE GRAZING. NO THIS BILL ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM BY MY GROUPS FROM ITS BUSINESSES IN WATER AGENCIES AND OTHERS- IT IN AND YOU KNOW AND MANY OTHERS. I HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION RESPECT US FOREIGN I VOTE- WITH ME HERE TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY. IS AND HAYDEN WHO IS A SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR WESTERN WATER IN RESILIENT LANDSCAPES AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. SHE'S ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY ARMS- SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE VERY GOOD THEY GIVE US A CHECK YEAHTHANK YOU SUMMER- LET'S TURN TO THE NEARLY SUPPORT WITH THIS MISS HAYDEN. WELCOME GOOD MORNING YEAH GOOD MORNING I AM IN HAYDEN WITH UNBEARABLE DEFENSE FUND THE SPONSORED EIGHTY TWO FIFTY TWO OUR STATE IS FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT EMERGENCY WATER SUPPLIES FOR COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURE AND WILDLIFE ARE DWINDLING AT AN ALARMING RATE AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN FULLY RECOVERED THE LAST DROUGHT JUST FIVE YEARS AGO AND JUST LAST WEEK THE GOVERNOR EXTENDED THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY TWO NINE MARK JOHNNY. DURING OUR LAST DROUGHT THE LEGISLATURE CHECK IMPORTANT ACTION BY PASSING THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT OR STIGMA. TO DRESS DECADE THE GROUNDWATER OVER PUMPING WHICH CAUSED LAND THANKS DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DRIED UP COMMUNITY DRINKING WHILE. STATEMENT AS ONE OF SEVERAL IMPORTANT STRATEGIES NEEDED TO BUILD LONG TERM WATER RESILIENT AS WE FACE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE MORE QUICKLY. AND INTENSELY THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED SURE ONE UNFORTUNATE REALITY OF THIS TRANSITION TO LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE WATER SUPPLIES IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. POTENTIALLY THE SIZE OF YOUR FAMILY WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES. AND THIS SUMMER WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME FARMERS CARRYING OUT ORCHARD VALLEY FIELD BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH. WATER TO GO AROUND. CLEARLY ADDED POINT WITH CHANGE AND WE WERE NOW WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. WITHOUT THE RIGHT INTERVENTIONS AGRICULTURAL LAND CAN BECOME A HAPHAZARD PATCHWORK OF DUSTY IDLED FIELD. WITH INVASIVE WE'D BEEN PASSED. FURTHER IMPAIRING AIR QUALITY WHERE IT IS ALREADY THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY AND PUTTING MANY FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS OUT OF WORK. WITH MEASURES LIKE A BEACH IS A DETAIL THE STATE COULD TRANSFORM ITS PREVIOUSLY IRRIGATED LAND INTO A WATER RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL REGION WITH A MOSAIC AND VIBRANT NEW LAND USES LIKE HABITAT CORRIDORS. MULTI BENEFIT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS AND OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL SPACES FOR FAMILY. BY ESTABLISHING THE MULTI BENEFIT LANDRY PURPOSELY INCENTIVE PROGRAM EIGHTY TWO COULD YOU TERRIBLE ENABLE FARMERS TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM VOLUNTARILY RE PURPOSING SOME OF THEIR LAND. IN NEW BENEFICIAL USES THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND WANTS AND ULTIMATELY THE PROGRAM WILL HELP TAKE THE STATE DOWN A NEW PATH TOWARD A MORE RESILIENT FUTURE FOR PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAPTAIN FREEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WHERE TWENTY- REBATE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR. AND HIS DOCTOR LATER TO SOME PROVISIONS ARE ADDED DURING THE SECOND HOUSE RELATED TO THE WILLIAMSON ACT WHICH WILL BE HEARD AND AFTER MANY WE JUST WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE ALTERNATE STOP FOR WORKING WITH US IN OUR MEMBER COUNTIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WITH THIS LANGUAGE. PRIOR TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARING AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS. OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE AN OPPOSITION BETWEEN. SURE THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY VERY GOOD- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE THEN I'LL JUST SAY AT THE OUTSET- WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. AS A MEMBER OF YOUR STAFF- GETTING THIS BILL IN IN SHAPE- YOU KNOW WE KNOW WE'VE HAD A BIT OF AN OVERALL HERE BUT I THINK IT STILL ALIGNS WITH YOUR PURPOSES AND HOPEFULLY WILL FUNCTION- AS A VERY UNIQUE ONE OF A KIND PROGRAM WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW IN LAW THERE'S- THERE'S- THERE'S VARIOUS PROVISIONS THAT THAT HAVE OTHER INCENTIVES OR- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR- CONSERVATION EASEMENTS OR LAND ACQUISITIONS BUT- NOTHING IT SORT OF HAS THIS MULTI BENEFITS APPROACH SO. I'M EXCITED ABOUT WHERE WHERE WE LANDED HERE I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS RAISED BY MEMBERS AND SOME STAKEHOLDERS- ABOUT. THE DURABILITY OF THE BENEFITS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH SORT OF THE ONGOING- NATURE OF THE OF THE OF THE USE OF THAT LAND AFTER THE- WARDED BEEN GIVEN SO I THINK THE TH WHAT WE TALK TO STAFF ABOUT- AND YOUR SPONSORS- WAS TO. ADULTS WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE AUTHORS MOMENTS YOU PUT FORWARD HERE BUT THEN WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA WORK TOGETHER I WOULD COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE STAFF A GOVERNMENT FINANCE OVER THE SUMMER BREAK TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AND DEVELOP THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH COMMITTEES I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'VE GT THIS RIGHT AND THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT- TO DEVELOP PROVISIONS REGARDING RETIREMENT OR- OR RESTRICTIONS ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING FOR PROJECTS THEY REPURPOSE IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL LANDS. FOR OTHER PURPOSES UNDER THIS BILL AND THE SECOND PIECE WOULD BE TO AUTHORIZE PAYMENTS TO INCENTIVISE FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS TO RE PURPOSING THOSE LANDS PURSUANT TO THIS BILL- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD DO- INSTEAD. WITHOUT CROSSING ANY GIFTING LINES- AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD DURABILITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING SO BLUNT AS AN ALL OUT RESTRICTIONS ON PUMPING WRITES. SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK IN THE CONTEXT OF SIGMA- SO- THOSE ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THAT IS- THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND YOU KNOW AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE ALL YOU KNOW ALL THE WORK ON YOU KNOW. YOUR WORKERS SHARE THE WORK OF STAFF- REALLY BEATING CAGE MEANT BUT YEAH MY MOMMA IN AGREEMENT OKAY GREAT- QUESTIONS COMMENTS OF SENATOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR DECEMBER REALLY REALLY FASCINATING I THINK SOME OF THE STUFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME- AND REALLY COMING UP WITH A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO. AND WE CAN'T JUST CHANGE PEOPLE'S WHOLE WAYS OF LIFE WITHOUT PROVIDING SOME KIND OF ALTERNATIVE RIGHT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOR DOES IT SEEM EQUITABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I GUESS IT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS AROUND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE ALREADY RAISED- BUT THEN I GUESS JUST CURIOUS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S LIVED AND WORKED AROUND AG WHY THE DECISION TO DO. THIS OR THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM TO DEVELOPER FELLOW GROUND BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE WILLIAMSON ACT WHY DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTIONS ARE JUST AROUND- THE ACTUAL PURPOSES I'M I'M SURE AT SOME POINT IT'LL BE DELINEATED OUT- BUT FOR SOME THINGS THAT ARE THAT CAN STILL BE WATER INTENSIVE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RANGE LAND AND CATTLE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND- NOT THAT I DON'T LIVE A GOOD BURGERS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE BUT- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT- THE- THE- THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE LAND WITH SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT. ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIS NON IRRIGATED LAND. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME I WE STILL. WE'RE IS IT GOING TO SOME COCONUT COURSE. A PROGRAM THAT I. MY ARE THE GROUND WATER BASEMENT IT NO SIGMA AREAS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER NEW PROGRAMSARE PUTTING IN. INDEED HAS A LIGHTER FOOTPRINT AND HOW HOW LIKE THAT FOOTPRINT IT'S GOING TO CREATE. BUT THOSE ARE SOME GREAT QUESTIONS AND AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED- THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH I THINK THE MONITORING AND REPORTING IS VERY- YOU KNOW IN A PARK CONCEPT OF THE BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE  PART OF IT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW- INSURING THAT WE PRIORITIZE OUR CRITICALLY. DRAFTED OUR BASINS IN EMPHASIZING THIS PROGRAM. FOR THOSE REGIONS- IS NOT THE HEART OF THIS KIND OF THIS BILL. AS FAR AS- THE RECENT CHANGES WE'VE HAD- AS A RELEASE IT WAS AN ACT I WILL HAVE TO TURN IT OVER TO- ARE A SPONSOR- VOTING OUT FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- BUT- YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME. REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMING TO ME I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THAT YOU KNOW WE WORK TO RESOLVE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- FOR- AGRICULTURE FOR THE INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FOR MANY REGIONS. ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE IMPACTED. SEVERELY BY THIS DROUGHT- AND THE ONE THING THAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS DROUGHT. IS IS HAVING TO WORK THROUGH CIGNA- AND IT'S- CERTAINLY- INSURING- THAT- WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT. THOSE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE SAME TIME HAVE A BENEFIT. FOR THIS REGION. WHERE THE- YOU KNOW. HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND ACRES IN THE SALAD AND SO IT'S SIGNIFICANCE AREN'T AREN'T. AND HERE AND I CAN WEIGH IN ON THE WILLIAMSON ACT BUT HUMAN- REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF THAT LANGUAGE- WE'RE AIMING TO ENSURE THAT. EXISTING LINES NOT CONTRACT OR NOT EIGHT THAT THE CENTER OF OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE NEW PROGRAM SO THE GOAL IS TO. REALLY ENSURE THAT REPRODUCING ACTIVITIES FUNDED BY THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH LAND USE AS- AN A CONTRACT THEN THAT. LANDOWNERS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE BLAZE MAX WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY INCREASED TAXES AT ST JUDE TO REPURPOSE PLANTS AND WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS THAT BUT JUST MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE- MANY- THAT SPOKE TO. THE TOP ON THE MIND AFTER THREE- EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE LANGUAGES THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM ON. AND. THEN IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS. EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WE JUST SAID NO THIS COME AND AN OTHERS FOR GOING FOR THE STATE HAS HAS AT NOT BEEN A TO UPHOLD OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN PAYMENTS OF WILLIAMSON ACT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND HOPEFULLY- AS WE'RE ADDING NEW THINGS AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY. HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR WE HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY BUT WILL CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO PAY FOR OUR OUR FAIR SHARE OF THAT- OF THAT PROGRAM SO IT'S- REALLY INTERESTING WORK I WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THIS GOES FORWARD- AND IT WAS- I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE PASSED A- SIGMA WHICH- EVERYONE THOUGHT THE WORLD WAS COMING TO AN END BUT- AS WE- LOOK BACK I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY SEE. THAT WE DID IT THAT PROBABLY AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT TO DO IT. AND STILL BE ABLE TO GO ON TO JUST THINK WHERE WE'D BE IF WE HADN'T PASSED THAT. IN THIS KIND OF DROUGHT THAT WE'RE HEADING INTO NOW. THAT AT LEAST WERE ABLE TO START TO MAKE PLANS. TO REALIZE WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY INTERESTING AND I THINK RIGHT THE SPACE SO WE NEED TO BE WORKING IS. HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WORKING AREA. GOING FORWARD UNDER NEW CONDITIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR AGAIN SENT EARLIER. I'M REMINDED OF THE LAST SCENE AND MOONSTRUCK WHERE THE FATHER JUST GOES JUST SO CONFUSED. BECAUSE THIS IS MOVING SO FAST AND YOU READ THE ANALYSIS BUT THAT AMENDMENTS COME AND THE AMENDMENTS IN SOME WAYS ON AMENDMENTS IT'S AN AGREEMENT TO DO SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE AND TRY TO WORK IT OUT. AND THIS MIGHT BE OUR ONLY BITE AT THIS APPLE AND SO- AND I'M GLAD FOR THE CLARIFICATION TO THE EXTENT IT WAS A CLARIFICATION ON THE WILLIAMSON ACT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT IS STILL AN ISSUE THAT IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE AND IT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE COMING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION. NOT JUST THAT SOMEBODY PAYS HIGHER TAXES BUT THIS BILL MIGHT PROTECT THEM AND THE WILLIAMSON ACT MIGHT PROTECT THEM SO WHY IS THERE A DUPLICATION OF PROTECTION AT THE END I THINK THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS. AS WELL. AND I WALKED INTO THIS HEARING. NOT AWARE THAT SOME OF THE STUFF WHAT WOULD BE TALKED ABOUT. WITH THE CONCERN THAT I WAS GOING TO DRILL DOWN ON. WHICH IS THAT- IT THERE'S THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TAKING LAND OUT OF USED TO RE PURPOSE BUT THERE'S NO STATEMENT IN THE BILL AS TO WHETHER THAT'S REQUIRED FOR HOW LONG AND IF THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS ACCRUING TO SOMEBODY AND THEN NO COMMITMENT TO SORT OF DO WHAT'S ON THE OTHER HALF OF THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE THE OPEN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I SORT OF GATHERED FROM THE SHIP. CHAIR'S COMMENTS. THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS OVER THE NEXT MONTH. AND I RECOGNIZE HOW FUNNY THAT IS JUST ON THE GROUND BECAUSE IT'S- IF THEY WISH THE LANDOWNER WISHES TO RE PURPOSE FOR ANOTHER REASON. IT'S LIKE HOW DOES THAT WORK. IF THE LANDOWNER WAS GOING TO RE PURPOSE ANYWAY WHY SHOULD WE SORT OF EXTEND SOMETHING TO THEM FOR SOMETHING THEY WERE GOING TO DO ANYWAY. IF IT TURNS OUT THE DEAD BECAUSE OF SIGMA THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER AND THEN UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SIGMA ONCE YOU DO THE PLAN AND BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY FORTY YOU GO WHEN YOU TRY TO FIND ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF WATER AS WELL AS CUTTING BACK. WHAT IF AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF WATER IS FOUND OR DEVELOPED. AND WE HAVE PAID SOMEBODY. TO TAKE LAND OUT OF USE AND THERE MIGHT BE WATER TO BRING IT BACK INTO THE USE THAT WAS THE PRE EXISTING USE HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THIS WHOLE SCHEME SO I THINK THAT THERE'S ALMOST AS MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. R. AS ANSWERED IN THE ONE BENEFIT BY TAKING THE CHAIRS OUR RECOMMENDATION ADDITIONALLY. IS THAT THE BUDGET MIGHT ACTUALLY BE FINALIZED BY THE TIME THAT WE DO ACTION AND THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THERE'S SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET THAT ADDRESSES THIS AND THEN YOU COULD LINE UP THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS AND HAVE A CLEAR IDEA. OF WHAT IS DOING AND SO GIVEN THAT GENERAL STATE OF MOVING TARGET AND CONFUSION R. R. I WOULD JUST SAY. THAT I HOPE THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE WILLIAMSON ACT. DOES IT AT BOTH BANDS. DOESN'T SORT OF- BECOME AN INHIBITOR TO DO THIS AND IN A WAY THAT THAT'S PROTECTED IN A WHITE TO ALLOWED TO DO THIS BUT IF IT'S SORT OF A DOUBLE PROTECTION IS THERE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT. AND THEN ON THE ISSUE OF THE USE IF SOMEBODY IS GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF USE. WHAT'S THE ISSUE THAT BINDS THEM IS TOO STRONG A WORD BUT ALLOWS FOR COMMITMENT THAT THE STATE GET SOME BENEFITS EITHER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR WHAT IT IS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE INCENTIVE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S THE BIG MISSING PIECE OF THIS. AND THEN. THE SO I SORT OF FEEL NOT UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY HOW THIS IS MOVING AND HOW THIS IS GOING TO END. A NEED TO SAY THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT JUST NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN WHATEVER THIS PROCESSES OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND THE BREAK AND- ETIENNE ON THE CHAIR. YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR EVEN IF THE BILL IS A YANKED BACK TO COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK. IF THIS BILL PASSES OUT TODAY. IT IS ON THE FAITH. THAT YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE CHAIR TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS BILL TO WORK. AND SO. YOU KNOW I GUESS GIVEN ALL. THE COMMITMENTS AND THINGS SO I WILL QUOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE I LIKED THE CONCEPT. BUT THERE'S JUST MUCH THAT NOT WHERE OUT YET NEEDS TO BE OUT FOR THIS. TO HAVE A RIGHT TO GO THE GOVERNOR'S. BESIDE JUDGES THOSE WITH THE ISSUES IS. AS I CAN. THAT BECAUSE IF THERE HAD BEEN THE- I WOULD BE ASKING YOU TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT. OR DEVELOP AN AMENDMENT. TO DEVELOP THE PROTECTION ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR ANY AFTER AN INCENTIVE IS GIVEN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GUARANTEED THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOR. HER TO COME INTO THIS HEARING AND DO TODAY SEEMS LIKE. GOT THERE ALREADY BUT. AND IT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS. THAT THIS CLOSE TO THE END OF SESSION AND THERE'S SO MANY OPEN ISSUES AND SO IT IS IN THE OTHER HOUSE AND IF IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T RESOLVE A LOT OF FUN THEN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE NEXT YEAR TO DO IT BUT BUT THAT'S JUST WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. THANKS FOR PUTTING UP WITH ALL OUR STUFF IS ON. AND THEN IF IT IF IT HELPS I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK AND MAKE THE COMMENTARY SAID EARLIER IT JUST TO BE CLEAR I MEAN THAT THE DEFAULT SUGGESTION WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT. THE RETIREMENT OF THAT LAND PERMANENTLY FROM GROUNDWATER PUMPING. THE REASON WE HAD IT OUT A LITTLE NUANCE AND DIDN'T JUST TRY TO SORT OF. BLUNTLY ADD THAT IN IS THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SIGMA. UNDER SAY A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN IT SUBMITTED IN THEORY- A DECADE FROM NOW AFTER AFTER AN INCENTIVE WAS GIVEN TO A PARTICULAR LANDOWNER. AND A DECADE OR EVEN TWO FROM NOW UNDER A UNDER GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS IN THAT AREA IT MAY BE THAT. OTHER LAND IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR TAKING OUT OF USE AND THAT LAND IS ACTUALLY RESTORED AND THE AQUIFER ITSELF IS IN CONDITION WHERE. THEY MAY HAVE YOU KNOW AN ALLOCATION THAT MAKES SENSE SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE. OVERLY RESTRICTIVE BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT THE PROPORTIONALITY OF THE BENEFITS AND THE DURABILITY AND TIMING WAS REALLY ESSENTIAL SO I THINK THAT DEFAULT ISN'T IT JUST AN OUTRIGHT- RETIREMENT- RESTRICTION BUT I THINK WE- WE WANTED TO ADD THAT NEW ONES IN THERE BECAUSE- IT WE STILL MAY BE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS OF THESE INCENTIVES WITHOUT A FOREVER. RETIREMENT SO JUST IGNORE IT IF I MY SISTER ARE COMMON I THINK THAT'S GREAT. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AGAINST THE ULTIMATE GOAL. OF THAT IS NEEDED AND I'M WAS NOT IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THIS WAS ADOPTED BUT I ONCE. IN A POSITION WHERE I WAS INVOLVED IN IT IN THE ONE THING FOR ME AND IT AND IT WAS MY INDIVIDUAL VIEW. OF IT IN THE END THE DATES WERE PUSHED OUT TO GET THE LAST VOTES I THINK COURT TO PROTECT THE LAST VOTED FOR ME. THE CRISIS IS SO PROFOUND I THOUGHT. THE DATE NEEDED TO BE CLOSER. AND ANDREA THE AGREEMENT WAS MADE TO PASS THE BILL. AND THE ONLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THE THING THAT I DIDN'T WANT IS IT THERE MIGHT BE TIME TO WORK THIS OUT IT IN TERMS OF A CRUX OF THAT IN AND OUT AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES OR THE ADDITIONAL WATER COMING AND SO- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS MR CHANCE. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS CENTERED AROUND TIME I JUST WANNA CLOSELY ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS THAT CENTER LAYERED- JUST MADE. AND I THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY- THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE'S STILL A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY A LOT MORE TO BE WORKED OUT- AND I THINK CONTINUING CONCERNS ABOUT. ENSURING THAT WHILE THERE IS A BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH. ENCOURAGING PEOPLE NOT TO PUMP RIGHT NOW- WHAT IS THE- WHAT'S THE LONG TERM- AND GET BACK FOR THE FOR THE STATE. SO HOW MAY I BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BUT- DOING SO. COURAGE IN YOU AND ASKING YOU- TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND- NO OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THIS IS ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TAXPAYERS OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA. YOU YOU HAVE A MY COMMITMENT TO DO SO. SORRY THANK YOU SOME MEMBER- ANY OTHER STRUCTURE OKAY I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION- AND- WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. AND HIS BUDGET PROCESS MOVING TO ANOTHER GOVERNOR'S GOT A PROPOSAL OUT THERE BUT HOPEFULLY THIS PROVIDES THE BONES OF A FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY TRY TO LAND SOMETHING HERE SO ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AN APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK YOU KNOW- AGAIN JUST A APPRECIATIVE COMMENTS THE CONCERNS AND- YOU KNOW WE YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. THE BEST WE CAN TO GET DISCUSSED VERSA AND RESPECT THAT'S PRIVATE THANK YOU SOME MEMBER- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. SOME OF. THE THAT'S A MOTION FROM SENATOR ADMIN- THEN THE MOTION. THE PATH IT'S AN AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT OR- OKAY CHICKEN SOMETHING MAYBE THE MOTION AND- HE UNDERSTOOD- CENTER AGREEMENT PERFECTLY SO YOU CAN READ THE MARCH. SO THE MOTION WOULD BE DO PASS TO RULES WITH A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR TO A MAN FOR THE COMEDIAN ALICE'S IN THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE UPON THEIR RECEIPT OF THE BILL. AND TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAFF OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE OVER THE SUMMER BREAK TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH COMMITTEES TO DEVELOP PROVISIONS REGARDING RETIREMENT OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON GROUNDWATER PUMPING FOR PROJECTS THAT REPURPOSE IRRIGATED LANDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES- UNDER THIS BILL AND- TO AUTHORIZE PAYMENTS TO INCENTIVISE FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS. TO REPURPOSE THEIR LANDS PURSUANT TO THIS BILL. VERY GOOD CHIEF CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WITH THAT EMOTIONAL FILING ON THREE EIGHT B. TWO FIFTY TWO TO PASS TO THE RULES COMMITTEE STERN. STERN ALL RIGHT JONES JONES HI ALLEN. ALLEN HI AIKMAN. AIKMAN ALL RIGHT GROOVE HEARD'S BIRD WAY SO LAYERS BY LAYERED ALL RIGHT LET ALONE. EVENTUALLY THE MEASURES FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THAT ON CALL- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU WANT TO BRING UP YOUR NEXT BILL FILING FOR YOU B. TWO FIVE TWO EIGHT FOUR- THIS AGAIN- ONE. OF ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I LIKE TO THINK- COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR GOOD WORK ON THIS BILL AND- AND I LIKE TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING- THE AMENDMENTS THAT. WERE PROPOSED AN ANALYSIS. IN IN IN THIS LEGISLATION WOULD- TO DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD TO SET AN OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL FOR OUR STATE'S. NATURAL WORKING LANDS AS PART OF NEXT YEAR'S SCOPING PLAN PROCESS. NOW BUT EVEN IF- OUR CARBON EMISSIONS- STOPPED AT THIS VERY MOMENT. WE ALREADY HAVE MORE CARBON IN OUR ATMOSPHERE THAN SCIENTISTS AND CLIMATE EXPERTS SAY SAFE. AND AS WE ALL KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP EMITTING- THIS CARBON- ANYTIME SOON AND SOAK SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON IN SOILS AND IN IN FORESTS WETLANDS AND OTHER NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY PROVEN WAY TO REMOVE CARBON. FROM OUR ATMOSPHERE AT A LARGE SCALE AND SO IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT- SEQUESTRATION ALONE COULD BRING US NEARLY 20% OF THE WAY TO MEETING OUR STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. AND TO CLARIFY THE A. R. B. SCOPING PLAN IS NON BINDING- IT'S NOT REGULATORY IN NATURE IT IS SIMPLY A PLANNING EXERCISE THAT IS DESIGNED TO SET GOALS AND PROVIDE POLICY OPTIONS. THE SCOPING PLAN ALREADY DEALS WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY. AND IT MAKES NO SENSE TO LEAVE THIS IMPORTANT CLIMATE SOLUTION ON THE TABLE. AND SO IS AND WE HAVE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS IN IN AND FIND A REGIONAL PATH FOR THAT EVERYONE CAN GET ON BOARD WITH AND WITH THAT MR SHARMA SPOKE FAST WHEN I VOTED AND WITH ME HERE TO PROVIDE THE TESTIMONY ANSWER SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS MISSILE.

RIDING LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR LONG TERM AND THE CALL OF DUTY CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OFFER PROTECTION YOU NEED FROM A CRIME IMPACT LIKE FIRE STREAM HE WILL ARISE AND FLOODS- THAT ARE ETHNIC THERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION METRIC TONS THAT REDUCTION CAN BE. ACHIEVED IF WE ACT NOW. EACH BY TWENTY FIFTH. FOR THE PAST THERE'S BEEN. WORK IN THE STATE ON THE- BUT SPITE OF THIS CLEAR CLINICAL AND COORDINATED.

I AM THAT POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK OR A COALITION OF FORMER LEADERS IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE GROUPS WORKING TO ADVANCE AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO BOUNCE THE CLINICAL AND RELATED STRATEGIES FOR VAST AND IMPORTANT NATURAL WORKING LANDS. WELL WE AGREE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE THAT WE MUST FIND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR EMBRACES THESE MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND DEVELOP THE NECESSARY BIG PICTURE ROAD MAP WE MOST DESPERATELY NEED TO BRING WORKING LAND POLLUTION SCALE IN WAYS THAT WORK WITH FARMERS. AND COMMUNITY IS NOT THE ANSWER WHEN OUR FARMERS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAD MORE FARMERS THAN EVER BEFORE SIGNING UP FOR THE STATE CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS LIKE THE OXFORD NOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY FOUR WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SCALE UP ITS WORK IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. AND FARMERS ARE DEMONSTRATING TODAY EVEN DURING THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES THAT THEY WANT THE STATE'S CLIMATE EFFORTS TO CONTINUE. RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I GO. THANK YOU SO. HONNOLD TO.

WE'LL COME TO IN PERSON. THIS ACTUALLY I'M GONNA GO FOR HOPE SORRY AS YOU WISH MISS SILVERTHORNE PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS A MEMORY VESSEL YES OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WE DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO MOVE FOR THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION OF THE RULE CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS SECTOR CAN PLAY IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CRISIS. CALCHAMBER DOESN FORTUNATELY REMAIN IT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL SEEKS TO IMPOSE CARBON GOALS ON ONE ECONOMIC SECTOR BEFORE AT CLOCK CARBON NEUTRALITY ANOTHER POST TWENTY THIRTY GOALS ARE EVALUATED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE SEEK ARE THOSE THAT WILL HELP TO ENSURE REGULATIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT DOESN'T DISRUPT. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IMPORTANTLY THE BUILD IS NOT SIMPLY SAY CARGO EVALUATE A GOAL TO MEET CLIMATE NEUTRALITY INSTEAD THE BILL SAYS QUOTE IDENTIFY AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLIMATE GOAL WITH INTERIM MILESTONES. FOR THE STATE'S NATURAL WORKING LANDS TO SEQUESTER CARBON TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AT THE END OF THE QUOTE. THAT GOAL IN TURN HAS TO FURTHERBUT IS NOT CONSTRAINED BY ANY CLIMATE NEUTRALITY OTHER EXISTING CLIMATE CARBON GOALS. ALTHOUGH IT IS DIRECTED TO BE DONE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEXT COPING PLANNED THIS LANGUAGE IS UNCONSTRAINED AND CAN BE INTERPRETED AS GIVING A R. B. BROAD AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE EMISSIONS CAPS ON THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. INCLUDING POTENTIALLY PULLING THE NATURAL WORKING IN SECTORS INSIDE THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM OR CREATING A DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION REQUIREMENT WITHOUT THE CAP AND TRADE PROTECTIONS. BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS REGARDING THIS BROAD INTERPRETATION THE AMENDMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE AT THE FARM BUREAU OUTLINE. ARE NECESSARY TO ALLEVIATE THE VAGUENESS IN THE BILL ENSURE NO ALTERATION OF CARDS AT THE READY OVER THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND AN INTENT THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE AUTHOR. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNTIL THESE MINOR AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN AND DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR RETURN- NOW TURN THE LAW. FOR TAYLOR ROSHEN CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS TAYLOR RICHMOND CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE LENA FROM CALCHAMBER ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF ACTING BUSINESS LEADERS AS OPPOSED WITH AMENDED CONCESSION- ARE REQUESTING AN OFFICIAL CLOVER REFLECTS WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ANY MYSTERY THIS IS ATTEMPT- SO THEIR FIRST ISSUE IS BAD TWO EIGHTY FOUR FAILED TO DIRECT CARD TO FRAME A GOAL SETTING ACTION AND WHAT'S- ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE FOR NATURAL LOOKING LAND. YOUR OFFER TO EVERY OTHER SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY WHEN CRAFTING COMICAL TO RESPECTFULLY WE FEEL THIS IS A PRETTY FAIR REQUEST- ADDITIONALLY WE ASKED THAT THE BILL DIRECT CARB TO DEVELOP CLIMATE GOALS BASED ON THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY. WHICH IS INTENDED ACTION. THIS IS GROUNDED IN EXISTING LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMITMENT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. AND WITH MYSTERY FOR COMMENT TODAY ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SCOPING PLAN SOMEWHERE BUT I'M CLEAR WHY THIS REQUEST CAN BE MANAGED. BOTH OF THESE ITEMS WERE CALCULATED SB TWENTY SEVEN A BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSED LAST YEAR- YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING THE FEMALE ASKS BUT THEY'RE REALLY CRITICAL FOR AN AG COMMUNITY IN CRISIS WE NEED TO TRANSITION. CLIMATE RESILIENCY AS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT A REGULATORY BARRIER AND THAT'S DONE BY ACCOMPLISHING IT THROUGH SOLICITING BY AND FROM THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE WORK- SO YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE'RE ASKING FOR COMMUNITY WITH THESE AMENDMENTS NETWORKING AND CLIMATE GOALS SHOULD BE BOLD- BUT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE PRACTICAL. IN ORDER TO BE SUSTAINABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK- WE'LL TURN NOW TO A GENERAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHICH IS TESTIFYING. SEEING NONE IN OUR AUXILIARY ROOM NONE OF THIS TREND LINES OPERATOR ANYONE WISHING TESTIFY NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL. FEDERALIST TURNED LINES IF WE CAN.

HIS NAME IN THAT POSITION AND AFFILIATION THANK YOU SO MUCH- IN NEXT WITNESS WE'LL GO TO LINE. THE LINE NUMBER SIXTY THREE THAT SIX THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING REBECCA ABOUT THE END OF THE HALF OF THE AMERICAN TO TAX YOUR GRAMMAR CALIFORNIA KIND GENEROUS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AFFECTS RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND WESTERN AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION WITH AND- NOT A MINUTE TO DISTANT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A LINE NUMBER SEVENTY TWO THAT SEVEN TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TRICIA GERINGER WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. SO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. MISTER CHAIR AT THIS TIME WE HAVE DEPLETED THE QUEUE OF OPPOSITION. MR ISN'T KNOWN LEFT IN Q. OKAY VERY GOOD- ONE IS NOT VERY GOOD WE'LL BRING BACK TO THE DICE THEN SENT A LETTER- FIVE THE- MYSTERY OF A SIDE PROJECT BILL AND SORT OF WAS INVOLVED. ON BEHALF OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN SETTING NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS A GOAL WITHIN THE CLIMATE PROGRAM THE HARDEST THING. WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEASURE ANY BENEFIT AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH THE SCOPE AND PLAN YOUR TRYING TO TIE SPECIFIC MEASURES TO LESS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND- AND WHEN WE DEVELOPED THE SOLE PROGRAM THE STATE DOES LAND CONSERVATION ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS WE REALLY HAD TO SPARK TO FIGURE OUT. HOW YOU MEASURED AND I WONDERED IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES YOU CONTEMPLATED TO MEET THIS GOAL ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES SORT OF LISTED A LOT OF THINGS IF THOSE THINGS ARE PART OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO MEASURE THEM AGAINST WHAT THE SCOPING PLAN WILL REQUIRE. RIGHT THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU KNOW I THINK THAT YOU KNOW STATE AGENCIES IS AS YOU MENTIONED MR SENATOR HATCH- THEY HAVE DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF NATURAL GLASS FOR OVER TEN YEARS- AND- YOU KNOW SECTOR STILL HAS BEEN FULLY INTEGRATED INTO PASCHAL IMPLANTS- AND OTHER. STATE EFFORTS AND SO CERTAINLY OUR GOAL HERE IS- YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH A. R. B. AS ALREADY STATED THEIR INTENT TO MAKE THIS A PART OF THE NECTAR SKULKING PLANT WE BELIEVE THAT STATUTORY GUIDANCE IS NEEDED AND THEN YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS BUILDING- THE PREVIOUS EFFORTS AND SOME OF THE BILL WE HAD LAST YEAR IS. IN THIS BILL. YOU KNOW IT GOES A STEP FURTHER BY BY. BY CALLING ON THE A. R. B. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING THESE THESE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LANDOWNERS- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT- INTEND TO YOU KNOW AND- MAKE. THE YOU KNOW THE IMPLEMENTATION AND INCENTIVES OF ACTIVITIES THAT COULD. POTENTIALLY SEQUESTER CARBON IN THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS THE BILL CALLS ON THE A. R. B. TO WORK WITH. STAKEHOLDERS WITH PARTNERS. TO DEVELOP STANDARDS AND METHODS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO TRACK. THESE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS- AND INDIA CERTAINLY WHETHER IT'S RELATED YOU KNOW THE SEQUESTRATION- SO YOU WOULD DEPEND ON THE A. R. B. TO BE THE ONE TO DEVELOP THE WAYS TO MEASURE THE SIZZLE THE NOT NECESSARILY ARE BASICALLY THE COORDINATING AGENCY IN THIS EFFORT- BUT CERTAINLY IT'S LOOKING TO. OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES- THAT WORK IN THIS SPACE ARE BRINGING THESE EXPERTS ARE IN THE SAME ROOM AND HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS IS CERTAINLY REACHING A POINT WHERE. WE HAVE THESE MEASURABLE GOALS IN PLACE. OKAY THE I JUST FOUND THAT. THE RBA DIDN'T ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS WHEN THAT HAPPENED- BUT- BUT WHAT LET ME- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE- I WAS AROUND MAYBE WAIT TILL YOU'RE CLOSE BUT LET ME ASK ABOUT SOME OF THE AGRICULTURAL CONCERNS BECAUSE IN THE- IN THE PACKET THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS WOULDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT FROM DROUGHTS. WHETHER MARKETS ARE PASSED AND- IF FOR EXAMPLE THE LAND CONSERVATION TO PROTECT I GLANCE IS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET INTERRUPTED BY DROUGHT WEATHER MARKETER PASS THEN ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THIS WAS AN ADMISSIONS EMISSIONS CAP ON THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. THE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D HEARD THAT. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT IN TERMS OF. OF WANTING TO MOVE AHEAD WITH YOUR BILL WHY IS THAT TRUE OR NOT TRUE FOR YOU. WELL YOU KNOW THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT WE INTEND TO IMPOSE EMISSION CAPS ON ON ON AGRICULTURE IT'S NOT MY INTENT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE- THE STATEMENTS- THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. OR THAT WERE MADE BY OPPOSITION WHO'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM EVERY STEP O THE WAY- AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS- AND- THEIR CONCERNS ONE OF THE STATEMENTS THAT I AGREE WITH THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW- ME AROUND NATIONAL WORKING LANDS THAT. THEY DO NOT HAVE A FINANCIAL RETURN BUT RATHER REQUIRE A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT BY THE LANDOWNER WOULD TRY TO CHANGE THAT EXACTLY WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. IS TO GENERATE- YOU KNOW- USE BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TO IDENTIFY- OPTIONS POTENTIAL INCENTIVES SOME- SOME- SOME REQUIRED- SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT TO DO WHAT WE CAN. TO ADDRESS THIS EMERGING CLIMATE CRISIS- YOU KNOW THERE'S A HE WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW- REGIONAL CLIMATE GOALS ABOUT. ONE DAY BEING- CARBON NEUTRAL OR- WE ARE WITHOUT NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN A PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND SO IT'S DOING OUR PART TO LEVERAGE EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION WE HAVE. TO INSURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN. TO YOU KNOW. RIGHT A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE AROUND THIS CLIMATE CRISIS IT REALLY IS- YOU KNOW I ENCOURAGE I'D BUY. APPRECIATE THEIR COMMENTS BUT CERTAINLY MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO FOSTER A COLLABORATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND IN THIS CASE IS AGRICULTURE- THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO MORE. TO SHORTEN THAT- WHERE- YOU KNOW THAT WE ENSURE THAT AGRICULTURE REMAINS PRODUCTIVE. THAT'S FULL IN THE STATE. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN THE CURRENT TRACK THAT WE ARE ON. I. THINK YOU KNOW. OR ARE WE IN THE LEAD. KNOWS ONE OF THE- WE CO AUTHORS OF A B. THIRTY TWO AND THE GENIUS OF HOW THAT BILL WAS NEGOTIATED. IS THAT IT GAVE AUTHORITY TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND IT GAVE MONEY OR THE ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT IT DIDN'T LITIGATE EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM IN THE BILL SO IT WAS DECIDED THAT. IT WOULD BE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR OR DIFFERENT THINGS IT WOULD BE WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE MONEY. AND THEY ARE BASED TO DO IT. R. AND THAT WAY WE COULD pPUT THE DEADLINES IN THE FORTIES AND THE MONEY IN IT RATHER THAN LITIGATE FORTY TWO INDIVIDUAL ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD. AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR STRUCTURE IS VERY SIMILAR. BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SET THE GOAL AND- EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE STILL I THINK SOME CONCERNS ABOUT MEASURING IT- AND YET THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOME ASSURANCE TO THE AG INDUSTRY THAT STRUCTURE THAT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD FOR THEM. AND WITH IN SETTING THE GOAL AND WITH AN EMPOWERING- AGENCIES OR PEOPLE TO MEET THE GOAL SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT YOUR POLITICAL CHALLENGE HERE IT IS YES BAG HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. BY- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE NATURAL CONCERN THAT. THAT JUST THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN THAT GET IN THE WAY OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND SO. I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE THIS AND I THINK THAT WE STILL NEED TO DECIDE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AND SOME OF THE MEASUREMENTS BUT- I THINK THE CHALLENGES IS MAKING SURE AGRICULTURE UNDERSTANDS THERE'S A WAY THEY CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD TO THEM SO. IN ANY EVENT SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT ABOUT- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I HOPE YOU JUST CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THE INSIGHT. CENTER LAYERED ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I MAKE A QUICK COMMENT- SHE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON THIS MEASURE AND FOR YOUR- DOGGEDNESS ON THIS ISSUE. SESSION AFTER SESSION- NOT GIVING UP ON TRYING TO UP LIT. NATURAL WORKING LANDS WE SPEND MOST THE DISCUSSION ON AGRICULTURE ISSUES. BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THIS THE BILLS EVEN BROADER THAN THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CARBON SINKS- IN CALIFORNIA AND LIMITING SOURCES- IN OUR FORESTS- IN OTHER HABITATS IN OTHER. REGIONS AND WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS. TO SETTLERS POINT. I THINK IT'S SMART ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK IS YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT PLUCKING AN ARBITRARY GOAL OUT. JUST FOR THIS SECTOR. YOU'RE GIVING DISCRETION ON THOSE TARGETS AND EXACTLY WHAT GOALS WERE GONNA SET. WITHIN NATURAL WORKING LANDS. AND SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT. THAT BEING ADDED FOR INSTANCE MENTIONED THINGS LIKE- BIODIVERSITY SO YOU'RE NOT JUST. HUNTING FOR CARBON BLINDLY- AND THEN YOU'RE STILL AWARE OF SORT OF OTHER OTHER GOALS IN MIND- YOUR YOU WERE STILL STAYING AWARE OF- THE PURPOSES OF THESE LANDS TO GROW FOOD. SO IT'S NOT JUST A SORT OF A BLIND MISSION ON CARBON- OVER EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IT'S INTEGRATED WITHIN THAT BROADER CONTEXT WHICH I HOPE RING SOME COMFORT AND A SENSE OF BALANCE ALTHOUGH I REALIZE. A LOT OF THIS WILL SHAKE OUT THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND- I FRANKLY THINK IT'S TOO MUCH FOR US TO TRY TO SOLVE ALL THAT HERE ALSO WHICH IS GOING TO ADD ONE MORE POINT WHICH IS TO THE TO THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT MEASUREMENT I THINK SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS. WE ADDED BRINGING IN CDFA AND C. N. R. AB THE NATURIST HERS AGENCY INTO THE CONSULTATION PROCESS AND HAVING THEM BRING THAT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE SO IT'S NOT JUST AIRBOARD MATH. BUT IT'S REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY CDFA AND SCENERY HOPEFULLY WILL ADD- SOME MORE- FIRMNESS TO EXPECTATIONS HERE SO I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR TO GET IT DONE AND I THINK IT IT TRULY MAKES SENSE. IN A MUCH BROADER CONTEXT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PUSH BEYOND IN LOOKING AT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON LOOKING AT CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE- THE GOVERNOR PUT THAT OUT THERE ON FRIDAY. I THINK THE AIRPORT'S GONNA BE TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AMBITIOUS IN THIS SCOPING PLAN AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE EQUATION SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON IF THEREARE NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- SLIGHTLY CLOSER. BUT THAT'S WHAT I. THOUGHT OKAY VERY GOOD- FOR ME MAKE SURE WE GET MOTION- I ACTUALLY. I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION FIRST. PAYMENT CENTER ADMIN SO MOVED- THE MOTION. DO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST A MEN IN RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. SHOULD CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FOLLOWED HIM FOR A B. TWO EIGHT FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN. STERN ALL RIGHT JONES. JONES NOEL ALLEN. ALLEN ALL RIGHT EGGMAN. EGGMAN ALL RIGHT GROOVE HEARD'S BURGER. BOYS SO LAYERED HI LIZARD ISLAND LOAN. OKAY THAT MEASURES FOUR VOTES WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE ABS AND MEMBERS- AMERICA YOUR CAREER I KEEP LOOKING TO BUT- SOME AREN'T WE'RE GONNA STAY FILE ORDER WITH ALL THE DUE RESPECT AT. SUMMER GALLAGHER YOU WANNA COME UP YOUR FILE ITEM FIVE EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. SENATORS GLAD TO PRESENT THIS MORNING IN EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY NINE- EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY NINE WOULD CORRECT AN OVERSIGHT IN THE CALIFORNIA CODE THAT PREVENTS THEACQUISITION OF CONSERVATION LANDS BY CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. UNDER CURRENT LAW STATE AGENCY MAY ONLY SELL OR DEED CONSERVATION LANDS TO PUBLIC AGENCIES OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS BUT NOT TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBS- THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE- YEAH PRETTY UNREASONABLE OVERSIGHT CONSIDERING THAT ARE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES ARE- THE ORIGINAL STEWARDS. OF OUR LANDS- THIS CAME TO MY ATTENTION IS- THE MID SHIP TO TRIBE IN MY DAY IN MY DISTRICT WHO HAS ANCESTRAL LANDS. AROUND THE CHICO- AREA. SOUGHT TO. WIRE AN EASEMENT THAT IS OPERATED BY A CHICO STATE FOUNDATION ON RIGHT PARIAN CORRIDOR- AND IN IN IN GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS FOUND THAT UNDER THE CURRENT RULES IN THE IN LAW WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER- THAT CONSERVATION. EASEMENT SO THROUGH THIS BILL WE SEEK TO REMEDY THAT AND ALLOW FOR TRIBES TO- OBVIOUSLY TAKE PART IN CONSERVATION PRACTICES AND ALSO OTHER- PRACTICES THROUGH THE RESOURCE AGENCIES- THAT PROVIDE FOR CONSERVATION OF LANDS THIS BILLS HAD UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. THROUGH ITS THROUGH HIS JOURNEY AND I AM JOINED TODAY BY VICE CHAIR SANDRA KNIGHT OF THE METRIC TO TRIBE- AND SAM CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA YNEZ BAND OF CHUMASH INDIANS. THANK YOU SIR MEMBER- WE WILL TURN IT TO OUR FIRST LEAD WITNESS- IS IT VICE CHAIR NIGHT. WELCOME TO THANK YOU FOR HONORING AS HE PRESENTS IN MORNING THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER SO MUCH FOR HIM SPONSORING THIS BILL- IT MEANS A LOT TO OUR TRIBE SO I AM THE VICE CHAIR OF THE MACHINE IN A TRACT THE BEEN THE VICE CHAIR FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WHICH IS SEEMS VERY CRAZY BUT- ABSOLUTELY THIS CODE WILL RIGHT A WRONG FOR CALIFORNIA TRIBES- IT'S JUST A CORRECTION PERIOD- AS ASSEMBLYMAN SAID THAT THIS LAW CURRENTLY LEADS OUT PREVENTS TRIBES FROM. PARTICIPATING IN. ACCEPTING LAND FOR WILDLIFE AND CONSERVATION AND FOR ANY PROGRAMS FOR GRANT PROGRAMS UNDER THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. SO WE DON'T WHAT TYPES ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PROGRAM FOR THE STATE AGENCY- IT IS. ONLY A CORRECTION. IT IS A NECESSARY CODE THAT WILL INCLUDE TRIBES CALIFORNIA TRIBES HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION RESOURCES MANAGEMENT THROUGH OUR OUR HISTORIES. WE ARE THE FIRST LANCE TOURS AND HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROVE TO PROTECT SALMON PRACTICE TRADITIONAL BURNING PROVIDE CULTURE RESOURCE PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS MAKE MADE GREAT PROGRESS TECHNOLOGY STARKEL VIOLENCE EXPLOITATION DISPOSITION AND ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND DISLOCATED CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS FROM ANCESTRAL LAND AND SACRED PRACTICES TODAY WE SEE MANY EXAMPLES OF TRIBES. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTNERING ON IMPORTANT PROJECTS SUCH AS RIVER RESTORATION PROJECTS WATERSHED RESTORATION PROJECTS ALL TO SAVE CRITICAL WILDLIFE HABITAT. THE POOL OF EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY NINE IS THE RIGHT DECISION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA NATIVE TRIBES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM VICE CHAIR- NEXT UP I THINK WE'VE SAM COHN FROM SENDING AS JEWISH. WELCOME MR COHN. THANK YOU SURE STERN I'M SAM CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND LEGAL OFFICER FOR THE SANTA YNEZ BAND OF CHUMASH INDIANS I'M A CORPORATE LAWYER I'M A TAX LAWYER AND I'VE BEEN A TRIBAL ATTORNEY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO I'M A PRETTY WEIRD DUCK MOST OF THE TIME I JUST WANT TO MAKE FIVE POINTS- THE CURRENT LAW. IT WOULD ALLOW THE WILDER WRITTEN BY LIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO APPROVE THE TRANSFER TO ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION. THE SECOND POINT IS THE TRIBE COULD JUST ESTABLISH A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION. ALL RIGHT A TWO MATCH WE HAVE THREE. RIGHT I EVEN LOAN ONE TO MID SHIP DUCK FAT LIKE AND ONCE THE NONPROFIT TOOK TITLE TO THE LAND THEY COULD RE TRANSFERRED TO THE TRIBE. ALL RIGHT AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE AN ISSUE. THE THIRD S EVERYONE EXPECTS THE WILDERNESS CONSERVATION BOARD TO PUT. CONDITIONS ON THIS TRANSFER BUT CURRENTLY THEY CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER IT. YOU KNOW WE WOULD EXPECT CONSERVATION EASEMENTS WE WOULD RESPECT EXPECT DEED RESTRICTIONS WE COULD EVEN EXPECT REVERSIONARY CONTINGENCIES IF THE LAND IS NOT USED AS IT WAS PROPOSED. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WILLIAMSON ACT HERE FOR THE LAST HOUR. I TRIED TO TAKE THE LAND INTO TRUST SUBJECT TO WILLIAMSON AXE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS ALL THE TIME. RIGHT THE FOURTH POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS ABOUT THE FEE TO TRUST PROCESS. YOU KNOW YOU ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH LASKO ANNEXATIONS WHERE CITIES ANNEX LAND FROM COUNTIES. WHAT ABOUT TRIBAL ANNEXATION PROCESS IS CALLED FOR YOU TO TRUST. ME TO TRUST TAKES THE LAND SUBJECT TO ALL. MY INCOME PRINCES OF RECORD. SO IF THE WIND WILL BLOW THE W. C. B. FILES A CONSERVATION EASEMENT THE TRIBE MUST HONOR THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT EVEN IF THE LAND GOES INTO A TRUST. AND THEN FIFTH WORK I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND THE WILDERNESS CONSERVATION BOARD ON ANY LANGUAGE. THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. HERE WE HAVE A UNIVERSITY AND A TRIBE THAT WANT TO WORK TOGETHER THEY NEED YOUR HELP TO MEND THE FISH AND WILDLIFE CODE TO ALLOW THE W. C. B. TO APPROVE. THE TRANSFER OF CONSERVATION LAND AMENDING THE FISH WILDLIFE CODE WILL ALLOW THE WILDERNESS CONSERVATION BOARD TO APPROVE. THE TRANSFER WITH APPROPRIATE CAN ADDITIONS TO MAINTAIN THE LAND AS CON. LAND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY INSIGHTFUL OPENING REMARKS TO VERY HELPFUL- WE'LL GO TO A GENERAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NOW. ANY IN OUR HEARING ROOM SEEING ONE.

THE LANGUAGE WE DISCUSS WITH THE AUTHORS TO AMEND A B. THREE SEVENTY NINE TO INSURE. THAT TRANSFERRED CONSERVATION LANDS- AS DESCRIBED IN IN THE LEGISLATION THE SITE IS FIFTEEN NINETY SIX POINT FIVE ONE SIXTY THREE. ARE MANAGED FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS TRANSFERRED. AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND% LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO THE APPLICABLE CONSERVATION EASEMENT- IF WE NEED TO MAKE ANY FURTHER REFINEMENTS OR IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT HAPPY TO TAKE HIM BUT THAT THAT SEEM TO ADDRESS- THIS OUTSTANDING CONCERN THAT SOMEHOW. BY GOING FROM A FEE TO TRUST YOU LOSE ALL THE ANY OF THE SORT OF UNDERLYING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR SOMEHOW IF YOU TRANSFERRED LAND UNDER CONSERVATION EASEMENT THAT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE. SWEPT AWAY AND YOU COULD. DO A LARGE SCALE RETAIL DEVELOPMENT WHERE IT OTHERWISE IT'S JUST TO BE HAPPY AS HABITAT IN THE IN THE IN THE EXAMPLE THAT THE SUMMER GAVE FOR IF THEY WERE OUTSTANDING REQUIREMENTS TO- THE APPLE I YOU KNOW- COASTAL. COASTAL ACT APPLICATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENT SENSE OF HABITAT OR- OR CLEANUP PROVISIONS- THAT THOSE WOULDN'T SUDDENLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THAT TRANSFERS SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT LANGUAGE- THE- SORT OF FOR A- OCT THIRTY. AN EVEN THOUGH WE HEAR THE CLEAR INTENT OF THE LAW I MEAN THE SPONSORS MAKE MY COMMENTS YES SIR IS IT MIGHT. ADDRESS THAT AND I THINK. OF THE WITNESS SAID- THIS WAS ONLY A CORRECTION. BUT IT'S A MONUMENTAL CORRECTION BECAUSE OF THE- RE DRESSES ARE AMAZING GRIEVANCE. IN OUR HISTORY- AND BECAUSE OF- LAND THAT WAS REMOVED AND BEING ABLE TO RETURN. TO OUR LAND AT SEA OPTION BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT MIGHT BE A APPEAR TO BE A MINOR CORRECTION. IT GOES TO A SOVEREIGN NATION. ARE NONE OF THE OTHER GRANTS GO TO SOVEREIGN NATIONS AND SO THAT SETS UP. A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. SITUATION FOR. THE TRANSFER AND THE ULTIMATE MANAGEMENT AND- A WHAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE JUST. MENTIONED IS THAT IN- WHEN LAND IS ACQUIRED. BY THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD RATHER SHORT OR MAKE A GRANT TO ACQUIRE TRANSFER LANGUAGE. IT IS ALWAYS FOR STATE PURPOSES IN THE STATE PURPOSE IS THAT. IT BE FOR EXAMPLE A WETLANDS WITH NO DEVELOPMENT. AND YET IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A FULL FLEDGED CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON IT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ACQUIRED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND SO TO ME. WHAT THE AMENDMENTS APPEAR TO DO ONE. IS THEY DO THEIR BEST TO PROTECT MOST SITUATIONS BUT THEY DO THEIR BEST TO PROTECT WHERE THERE'S ALREADY AN EASEMENT BERARDI SOMETHING THERE AND YET IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH THAT INFERENCE BUT THOUGHT. THERE THEN SO IT IT SEEMS THAT. THE BEST PROTECTION WOULD BE. TO GUARANTEE THE TRAIN LINE. THAT AIR MISTER COLLAGEN OUR GAVE GOOD COMMENTS THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HIS COMMENTS. THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT PUTTING AN EASEMENT ON. FOR A REVERSION OR OTHER THINGS TO TEND TO BE PART OF THE TRANSFER LANGUAGE AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T RELY ON WHETHER THERE'S AN EVEN APPLICATION OF WHETHER THERE ARE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN. YOU'RE GETTING THE PROTECTION IN THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRANSFER IT AND SO FOR ME. THAT WOULD BE THE IMPORTANT THING TO HAVE IT IN THE AMENDMENTS IS THAT WE JUST KNOW THAT EVERY PARCEL THAT IS TRANSFERRED IS GOING TO BE CLEAR TO THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS DESIGNATED REQUIRED AND THAT WAY. EVEN THOUGH- MAYBE THE REST OF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE FINE. YOU YOU'RE NOT GETTING INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT TRUST OR SOVEREIGNTY ATION YOU'RE TRANSFERRING THE LANDS WITH REQUIREMENTS ON IT THAT WERE RELATED TO THE RECENT THAT THE LAND WAS ACQUIRED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD BE. THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT AGAINST ANYTHING HERE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT MR KHAN SAID YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE AMENDMENT UP FRONT. AND YOU DO THAT AND SO FOR ME THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THEN YOU KNOW I'M COMFORTABLE BECAUSE- TO BE HONEST AND IT MIGHT BE A DICEY COMMENT TO MAKE IT PUBLIC. THERE WAS A SIMILAR. OUR THING DONE WITH THE PUBLIC. COMMISSION AND P. JEANNIE LANCE. AND IT BASICALLY GIVES A FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL. TO TRIBES AND IT GOT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME PROCESSES THAT WERE ALREADY ADVANCED. AND IN A WAY THAT. YOU WANT TO PROTECT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT ON THOSE PARCELS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH P. GENIE LAMP YOU WANT TO HONOR THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES THE SACRED SITES IN THE HISTORIC SITES AND ALLOW FOR MANAGEMENT AND THOSE THINGS BROUGHT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WE HAVE THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE SO. A HIGH WOULD SUPPORT. AN AMENDMENT THAT'S THAT'S INVOLVED IN THE TRANSFER AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SOVEREIGN NATION OR THE TRUST YOU'RE JUST PUTTING IT ON THE LAND AS SHE TRANSFERRED AS A CONDITION SO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS IN THE PROCESS OR WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD REALISTICALLY DO BUT- BUT I THINK THAT WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE REALLY STRONG. IN AND MY SUGGESTION THERE CERTAINLY ARE THE LANGUAGE THAT THAT I READ. THIS IS TO AMEND A B. THREE SEVEN NINE TO INSURE TRANSFERRED CONSERVATION LANDS. ARE MANAGED FOR THE PURPOSES. FOR WHICH THE LANDS WERE TRANSFERRED. AND CONTINUED SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. BUT RATHER THAN SAYING SURE TRANSFERRED CONSERVATION LANDS WE COULD JUST CLARIFY I THINK THAT IT'S IN THE TRANSFER OF THAT PLANT. SO IT'S IT COULD BE IN THAT. THAT THAT WOULD BE- RECOGNIZED OR PROVIDED FOR IN THE TRANSFER ITSELF THAT FEEDER TRUST TRANSFER AND IT SEEMS THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE HERE IT MIGHT STILL NEED TO BE TWEAKED A BECAUSE IT SAYS FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS TRANSFERRED AND THAT'S RATHER OPEN AHA I THINK IT'S FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS ACQUIRED BEFORE TRANSFERRING THAT. THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE. HI R. E. THE CONSULTANT SET OFF MARKET DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF PLANT AND I THINK THAT'S CORRECT IN THE REAL PROBLEM IS WE'RE TRYING TO DO BILL THE REPLACED EVERYTHING HERE AND SO HOW IN DOING THAT DO WE MAKE SURE THERE'S NO INFECTION SO FAR IN ANY EVENT- THE- WELCOME ANSWER QUESTION WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE WITH SUCH AN AMENDMENT THAT SORT OF. TIES THIS DOWN IN THE TRANSFER YES I MEAN I'M AGREEABLE TO LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND- IN TALKING WITH THE CHAIRMAN I THINK WE CAN WORK HASH OUT WHAT THE EXACT LANGUAGE IS YOU GUYS ARE JUST KIND OF TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SHOULD BE ACQUIRED I THINK WE CAN WORK THAT OUT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE EXACT LANGUAGES BUT IN GENERAL WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY HERE IN THE INTENT IS. THAT WHATEVER THE LAMB WAS ACQUIRED FOR THE CONSERVATION PURPOSE AT THAT WOULD CONTINUE- YOU KNOW AFTER THE TRANSFER. IN THE END ANY RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD. YOU KNOW PUT IN PLACE. BY THAT- ANY APPLICABLE LAWS THAT WOULD BE- THAT THAT LAND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO WITHSTAND PLACE I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT AND- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S WANTING TO. YOU KNOW MESSED WITH THAT ANYHOW I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD RESPONSE AMONG CLEAR ON THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE STILL GOING TO REFINE THE AMENDMENTS AFTER WE MOVE OUT OF THIS HEARING. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN SO I THINK WE THE OTHER WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT- WE CAN. REFINE THAT PROVISION IN DRAFTING UP AROUND. ENSURING THAT IT'S IN THE TRANSFER- ITSELF AND THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE PURPOSES FOR WHICHIT WAS TRANSFERRED BUT ALSO- TO AND- WHICH WAS ACQUIRED. AND I HAVE A FEELING THE CONSULTANT WANTS TO CONSULT. IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. OKAY THEN THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD OUTCOME TO MAKE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE FAVORABLE TO DRESSING THAT WAY YOU'RE OPEN TO ADDRESSING AT THAT POINT YET AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF WILL BE AT THE TABLE IF WE CAN DO THAT WE COULD GET THERE OKAY OKAY I THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US AND PROVIDING THAT CLARITY AND THEN MAYBE ONE THING BECAUSE WE PLUNGE DIRECTLY INTO THE WEEDS- LET ME JUST SAY AT THE HIGHER LEVELS THIS IS A NOBLE PURPOSE. AND THIS REALLY DOES A REDRESS HISTORICAL GRIEVANCES IN A GOOD WAY AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO IT AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND IT'S THE CHALLENGE WE'RE FACING IN THE. DIABLO CANYON LANDS AND OTHER PLACES. THE IT ANSWER TRY. SOME OF THEM THAT MR KHAN REPRESENTS ARE PROBABLY MUCH MORE ADVANCED BUT THEY'LL BE A CAPACITY ISSUE. AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE MANAGEMENT THE- WHAT. I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REDRESS THE HISTORIC AGREEMENT SO. AT THE RIGHT TIME I WOULD MOVE WHATEVER MOTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL LET THE CONSULTANT ITERATE THE MOTION- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS HERE. WE VERY GOOD THAT'S A- ETHEREAL SECOND- DISSENT AROUND I'M JUST GOING TO. THINK CENTRE LAYERED AGAIN FOR- I I'VE DONE JUST ABOUT SAYS IT MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF PHONES EARLIER IN THE CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE ON TO GET THIS TO A GOOD PLACE. FOR IT OKAY THANKS FOR THAT- NO FURTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS LATER CLOSER THANK YOU SENATOR AND I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR I. HAVE A OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD MOVE THE MOTION THAT- CONSULTANTS ABOUT TO HELP MARK VERY GOOD THAT'S A MOTION FROM CENTER EARLIER. CHIEF CONSULTANT OKAY. LET ME READ THE AMENDMENT ONE MORE TIME JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S CLEAR ON WHAT THE AMENDMENT IS. AMANDA AB THREE SEVEN NINE TO INSURE TRANSFERRED CONSERVATION LANDS AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION FIFTY NINE NINETY SIX POINT FIVE ONE SIX. SUBSEA PARAGRAPH THREE. ARE MANAGED FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE LAND WAS PER. TRANSFERRED AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE CONSERVATION EASEMENT. THE MOTION IS TO PASS- TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN CAN'T JUST BEFORE YOU DO THAT CAN I CLARIFY THE MOTION I MADE YES- AND THEY'LL BE CONTINUED WORK ON REFINEMENT OF FAT THAT INVOLVES THE CONSULTANT. THE AUTHOR AND A CHAIR. YES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONTESTANTS IN THIS MESS. RIGHT ARE VERY GOOD. THANK YOU THANKS FOR THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. WHILE I DON'T FIVE A. B. THREE SEVEN NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS STERN HI. JONES HI. ALAN ALL RIGHT LRA AIKMAN FIGMENT HI HERZBERG GROW I'M SIR GROVE HERZBERG QUITE SO LAYERED LAYERED HI. LOAN OKAY MEASURES FIVE VOTES TO LEAVE IT ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR EFFORTS HERE INTO THE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS APPRECIATED- THIS AGUILAR CURRY- SCENE THE NIGHT OKAY YOU'RE UP. ASIAN. YES IN DURING- YES SHE EARNED IT NO I APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMANMEMBERS THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME IN MY OFFICE SINCE LAST YEAR ON A B. TWENTY ONE OH SIX. HERE WE ARE A. B. SIX FOURTEEN IT GENERATES FUNDING FOR THE EXISTING NESTING BIRD HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE FARMERS. AND LANDOWNERS TO CULTIVATE A PLANT COVER CROPS. OR NATURAL BIT OF AGITATION ON IDLE LANDS TO PROVIDE WATERFOWL AND UPLAND GAME BIRDS. WITH WILDLIFE HABITAT. THE MEASURE ADOPTS A TEN DOLLAR SURCHARGE ON THE STATE DUCK AND UPLAND GAME BIRD STAMP IS REQUIRED TO HUNT WATERFOWL AND UPLAND GAME BIRDS. EIGHTY SIX FOURTEEN ALSO REQUIRES GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY OVER THE SPENDING OF FUNDS COLLECTED BY THE UP GLAND A GAME BIRD STAMP. IN LINE WITH CURRENT PRACTICES FOR THE STATE DUCK STAMP. LACK OF AVAILABLE NESTING COVER ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS LIKE THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY RICE GROWING REGION IS A SIGNIFICANT LIMITING FACTOR FOR BREEDING WATERFOWL AND OTHER GROUND NESTING BIRDS. THE NESTING BIRD PROGRAM IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S GROWERS NEEDS AS FUNDS CAN BE USED TO PLANT COVER CROPS. ENHANCE EXISTING NESTING BIRDHABITAT AND ESTABLISHED NESTING COVER ON LANDS THAT ARE FOLLOWED UNDER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. A. B. SIX FOURTEEN IS A NAP AS A RESOURCE GENERATING CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT WILL COMPLEMENT OUR STATEWIDE GOALS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION. IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND PROTECTION OF OUR WATER FILL SPECIES. THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION ENJOYS A WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM A DIVERSE COALITION SPORTSMEN'S GROUPS CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS AND AGRICULTURAL REPRESENTATIVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MARKEDLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME MEMBER- WILL TURN TO LEAD SUPPORT THEN LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL BE ON THE LINE SO MR CAN ONLY MISTER BROWN. PLEASE JOIN US. THERE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION- THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO FUND THE EXISTING NESTING BIRD HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM AS A B. X. FOURTEEN PROPOSES TO DO. OUR LOCAL WATERFOWL BREEDING POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED 36% STATEWIDE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WALL RING NECKED PHEASANT POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY 90% IN SOME AREAS THANK. YOU THOUSAND. IT ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE WAS A DIE OFF OF OVER SIXTY THOUSAND WATER QUALITY PLYMOUTH REFUGES LAST YEAR YOU DOING AVIAN BOTULISM OUTBREAK. MANY OF THE BIRDS AFFECTED ONE WATERFALL THAT BREED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BUT USE THE KLAMATH REFUGES PROMOTING PURPOSES. THE CURRENT DROUGHT IS ALSO PUTTING EVEN MORE STRESS ON THEIR POPULATION. THESE ARE SHOWN- AND DEMONSTRATED THAT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NOTHING COVERED THROUGH THE BREEDING SEASON CAN GREATLY BENEFIT LOCAL WATER FOUNTAINS AND OTHER BIRDS. SAMPLE THE RESULTS OF A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN RIGHTS COVER CROP ROTATION PILOT PROJECT. FOUND THAT ANNUAL COVER CROPS LOCATED ADJACENT TO WRITE ALL DIVISION PRODUCED ESPECIALLY HIGH NET THAT RATE. SHARE WITH OTHER HABITAT BUT THE SCIENCE REALLY SUPPORTS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IN ADDITION TO HELPING GAMEBIRDS THE PROGRAM WOULD BENEFIT OTHER GRASSLAND SPECIES LIKE NASTY KONG BIRD AND POLLINATOR SPECIES LIKE MONARCH BUTTERFLIES. IT WOULD ALSO HELP WITH THE QUESTER CARBON IMPROVE SOIL HEALTH AND PROVIDE AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. THESE REASONS- PLEASE SUPPORT AB SIX FOURTEEN THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SURE THE FLOOR BROWN ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION. MY COMMENT WITH BOTH MCKINLEY HIGH IN REGARDS TO THE TESTING PROGRAM BUT THEN ALSO EXPRESSED SOME SUPPORT AND- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD HELP- CREASE PARTICIPATION IN THE WINTER RIGHT HABITAT INCIDENT PROGRAM PROGRAM. THAT WAS CREATED JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR LANDOWNERS- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HE RICE INDUSTRY I PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE PACIFIC FLYWAY AND WINTER FLOODING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- TO THAT ROLE THAT WE PLAY. AND WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS THAT OUR PROGRAM IS BENEFICIAL- BUT ADDED GOES WITH ANY PROGRAM LIKE THIS HI AREAS WHERE IT CAN BE IMPROVED WANT TO TEMPLE MINUTES AND THAT'S THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU FIND IN EIGHTY SIX ONE FOUR WE ASK FOR YOUR I.

AFTER YEARS WAVES WILDFIRES ROLLING BLACKOUTS AND LOSS OF OVER A MILLION JOBS WE HAVE A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY JUST TWENTY TO THIRTY MILES OFF OUR COAST TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO ONE OF OUR WORLD'S GREATEST UNTAPPED SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. OFFSHORE WIND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE MEET CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND PROVIDE GOOD PAYING JOBS. IN EUROPE AND ASIA MANY COUNTRIES ARE FAR AHEAD OF THE UNITED STATES. FORTUNATELY THE BY DEMONSTRATION HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN OFFSHORE WIND. WELL EAST COAST STATES HAVE ALREADY SET TWENTY NINE GIGAWATTS OF TARGETS IN THIS AREA. CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISHED NONE AND WE MUST ENSURE WE'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND. THIS BILL GIVES US A CHANCE TO CATCH UP PARTICULARLY WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE WHITE HOUSE IN OUR GOVERNOR. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LEASE AUCTIONS OFF OUR COAST. OFFSHORE WIND CAN ENSURE A DIVERSE RELIABLE PORTFOLIO OF CLEAN POWER. COMPLEMENTING SOLAR WITH WIND ENERGY AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN. IT WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF HIGH SKILLED JOBS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. THE S. P. ONE HUNDRED JOINT AGENCY REPORTED SHOWN THAT WITHOUT OFFSHORE WIND. TOTAL ENERGY COSTS BECOME A BILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. BECAUSE I SURE WOULD ALLOWS RENEWABLES TO MEET ENERGY DEMAND DURING ALL HOURS YEAR ROUND. THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE TAP INTO ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF OFFSHORE WIND WHILE GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO OUR STATE'S MARINE AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. AND PRIORITIZING DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS OF EAST CONFLICT. BY STOP MOTION A PLAN TO HARNESS THE POWER OF OFFSHORE WIND THIS BILL ALLOWS TO JUMP START A NEW INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE.

THE NEED TO ADD MORE FORMS OF ENERGY TO IT AS THE NUMBER SHE WAS RIGHTFULLY FOCUSING ON HOW TO INCREASE POWER PRODUCTION BY HARNESSING CALIFORNIA'S INFINITE WIND RESOURCE. HIGHLY TRAINED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE PRINCE'S PLAY PIVOTAL ROLE IN BALANCING ENERGY ENERGY NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. BY MAINTAINING INSTALLING ALL TYPES OF POWER INFRASTRUCTURE HE'S BLUE COLLAR JOBS BY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR MEMBERS FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES AND A MIDDLE CLASS EXISTENCE.

A STRATEGIC PLAN TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME WE NEED TO DO THIS- AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ON THINGS THAT. WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHEN WE'RE GONE AND THIS IS I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM SO WITH THAT. VERY MUCH RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. A GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH- THERE'S A MOTION FROM SENATOR LAYERED- AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. BUT FIRST A MINUTE RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHIEF CAN SOMEONE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PILOT M. SIX AB FIVE TO FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS SO FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE FIRST AMENDMENT ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS RELATED TO MULTI BENEFITS SOLUTIONS AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOUR COMMITTEE. ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO IRON OUT THE LANGUAGE RELATE RELATED TO PREVENTING TYPE CONVERSION EVEN IF IT MEANS- WORKING OVER THE SUMMER RECESS AND WE ARE VERY CLOSE. EIGHTY SIX NINETY SEVEN WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM FOR THE STATE TO PLAN MANAGE AND IMPLEMENT FOREST RESTORATION PROJECTS ON U. S. FOREST SERVICE LANDS THROUGH AN EXPANDED AND FORMALIZED GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY OR G. N. A. WILDFIRES ARE A CONTINUING AND GROWING PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FREQUENCY SIZE AND INTENSITY OF THE WILDFIRES ARE INCREASING EVERY YEAR IN FACT THE TOP SEVEN LARGEST WILDFIRES HAVE ALL OCCURRED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FIVE OF THE TOP SIX OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONG WHICH RESULTED IN MORE THAN FOUR POINT ONE MILLION ACRES BURNED. MANY MAJOR WILDFIRES START ON THE 57% OF CALIFORNIA FOREST LNDS OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN SPREAD TO END DAMAGE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES BURNED ON FEDERAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS FOREST HEALTH AND REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS. THE G. N. A. IS A FEDERAL AUTHORITY ALLOWING STATES TO CONTRIBUTE FUNDING AND STAFFING TO ADVANCE FOREST AND WATERSHED RESTORATION ON FOREST SERVICE LANDS. EIGHTY SIX NINETY SEVEN FORMALIZES AND EXPANDS THE G. N. A. IN ALIFORNIA. IT IS DOUBTLESS HIS PRIORITIES FOR WHICH TYPES OF PROJECTS SHOULD BE FUNDED. IT ALSO LISTS ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDES GREATER DETAIL FOR THE ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING ALLOWING STATE WORKERS. TO HELP PREPARE NI PA AND SEQUEL WRITTEN REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTS AND ENGAGE IN PROJECT PLANNING LIKE THE PREPARATION OF RESOURCE SURVEYS. ANALYSES AND REPORTS. THESE ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVITIES NOT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED IN STATUTE EIGHTY SIX NINETY SEVEN WILL ACCELERATE THE PACE AND SCALE OF ECOLOGICALLY BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT. AND REDUCE STATE WILDFIRE RISK. I HAVE TWO IN THIS IS ELIZABETH FORSBERG ON BEHALF OF MY SPONSOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND ALSO JULIA HALL. ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WATER AGENCIES AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SEPTEMBER AND- I'LL ULTRABOOK TURNED TO LINES FOR LEAD SUPPORT I WOULD SAY MAYBE MAYBE TNC CAN CLARIFY BUT I THINK ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WE DO HAVE- AT LEAST AN AGREEMENT FOR A CURRENT AMENDMENT TO TAKE FORWARD AND THEN WE CAN WORK ON FURTHER REFINING IT BUT LET'S TURN TO THE LINES AND TRY TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT I THINK STAFF AND- THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE'RE TALKING LEADING RIGHT UP TO THIS HEARING SO- S. FORSBERG. THANK YOU TURN NUMBER WAS FOUR FOUR KIND OF MUSICAL THEATER ACTOR POLICIES THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE SPONSORING A B. SIX NINETY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA RESTORATION NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF CALIFORNIA BOB BACKLUND. ONE KEY BARRIERS AND PROFICIENT BACKING AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY RESTORE FORESTED LANDSCAPE SCALE. TALKING ABOUT THE DOCTORS. ONLY ON THE PRODUCTS TO IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH THAT COVERS ALL OWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL. EIGHTY SI NINETY SEVEN IT PROVIDED WHAT THIS APPROACH. BARBER'S DON'T STOP AT YOUR SEXUAL BOUNDARIES THE BILL WILL EXPAND THE COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND RESTORE WATERSHEDS ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIA. RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS FORESTALL ALMOST COMPLETED THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FARGO. AUTHORIZING THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SIGN AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE THE SHARING OF. STAFF AND OTHER RESOURCES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES. EIGHTY SIX NINETY SEVEN WHAT EXPANDED NEIGHBOR ACCORDING CALIFORNIA BY LAUNCHING A FORMAL PROGRAM. AND HELPING BUILDCAPACITY THE STATE TO ASSIST WITH THE PROJECT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION ON NATIONAL FOREST LAND. THE AWFUL HIGHLY THE IMPORTANCE OF WINTER KILL COLLABORATIVE FORCE PROJECT WHERE TRADITIONAL FUNDING AND RESOURCES ARE LIKELY TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRE RESILIENCY. ONE EXAMPLE OF THE NORTH YOU BROUGHT FORTH PARTNERSHIP OR PARTNERS ARE WORKING TO QUICKLY PLAN FINANCE AND EMPLOYMENT FORCE RESTORATION ACROSS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. THE SHARES GEORGIA CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH IT'S CRITICAL TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES WE APPRECIATE IT THE NUMBER TWO HOUSE LEADERSHIP ON THIS. ISSUE WERE STACKED WITH REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. VERY GOOD- AND THAT DIDN'T PROVIDE CLARITY ON WHAT I WAS ASKING ABOUT BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT WE'LL GET INTO IT AFTERWARDS WE'LL GET TO THE NEXT TO. LEAD WITNESS- JULIE BISHOP HALL I BELIEVE. WITH AQUA THAT'S WE HAVE LISTED HERE. YES GOOD MORNING KERR- MY NAME IS JULIA HALL AT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER. DECEMBER HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN. OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS AND HEADWATERS ARE ON FEDERAL LAND AND FOREST MANAGEMENT IN THESE AREAS HAVE BECOME AN URGENT ISSUE DUE TO INCREASINGLY SEVERE WILDFIRES CAUSED IN PART BY OVERGROWN UNDER MANAGED FOR A- DIFFERENT THE HEADWATERS OF THE ENTIRE STATE AS WILDCARDS FOR WATER QUALITY AND- CLIENT. AND DAMAGE CRITICAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE SOMETIMES STRUGGLED TO DEVELOP A COHESIVE RESPONSE IN THEIR EFFORTS. TO MANAGE MORE THAN A TRUCK PILED BY RED. BUT LAW CURRENT GRANTS THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY AN EFFORT TO ALLOW THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER MORE EASILY ON THE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. SO WITH MEREDITH EFFORT BY CREATING A DEDICATED PROGRAM AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN ADDITION A. B. SIX NINE SEVEN WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO CONTRACT OUT OTHER LOCAL COVER LOCAL AGENCIES INCLUDING WATER AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. WHICH CREATES MORE INCENTIVES FOR COLLABORATION THEY CALL THEIR INPUT NOT PERTAINING TO COORDINATE ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THE FRENCH MEADOWS PROJECT IN VANCOUVER PROJECT THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THAT BILL. IN THIS PROJECT CARTER COUNTY WATER AGENCY WORKED WITH THE COUNTY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND OTHERS TO RESTORE THE LAND AND REDUCE FUEL THE HEADWATERS OF THE MIDDLE FORK OF THE AMERICAN RECORD. EACH ENTITY BROUGHT DIFFERENT TOOLS. TO THE TABLE TO WORK TOWARD COMPLETION. IMPROVING STATE FEDERAL ABILITY TO MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH AND HAD WATER. AT BOTH THEIR ABILITY TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WILDFIRES AND LEAD TO HELP YOUR HEADQUARTERS. FOR THESE REASONS ARCO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. K. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'LL TURN OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- THERE ARE NONE IN THE HEARING ROOM- SEEING ANY IN THE- AUXILIARY ROOM NONE.

IF YOU WISH TO VOICE OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE DOING A PROPOSITION. OKAY SO NO OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OF BEFORE I GO TO MEMBERS THOUGH- I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME CLARITY I THOUGHT WE HAD AT LEAST LANDED ON- AN AMENDMENT- THAT WE CAN WORK TO FURTHER REFINE FOR AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO PREVENT TYPE CONVERSION- DO WE WANT TO TRY TO GET SOME CLARITY ON THAT. I'M SURE OR WE CAN ASK THE SPONSOR JUST FOR REFERENCE FOR THE RECORD NUMBERS AND LIKE ALL ALL SPELL IT OUT JUST SO THAT IT'S CLEARLY READ INTO THE RECORD. I THINK WE HAVE LANGUAGE- BUT THIS WAS ABOUT. AVOIDING TYPE CONVERSION WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING THESE- FORSTER LANDSCAPE TREATMENTS SO- IT'S LISTED ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS IT'S SIMPLY A BOLD IT SAYS ADD LANGUAGE TO PREVENT TYPE CONVERSION. THIS IS OUR- SORT OF CURRENT WORKING DRAFT IS PROJECT SHALL BE DESIGNED TO PREVENT TYPE CONVERSION AND THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE PLANTS AND GRASSES. AND BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE PROVIDE FOR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION AND FIRE RESILIENCY PROJECTS APPROPRIATE TO THE LANDSCAPE. AND VEGETATION BEING TREATED NATIVE SHRUB LANDS SUCH AS CHAPARRAL AND COASTAL SAGE SCRUB SHELL OF ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF FLAMMABLE NON NATIVE SPECIES AND THE RESTORATION OF NATIVE SPECIES WHERE APPROPRIATE- IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REFINEMENT WERE VERY MUCH OPEN TO THAT BUT- WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO YOU IS. THE AUTHOR OF FREE FOR PRESENT PURPOSES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THAT IS TOTALLY ACCEPTABLETO ME BUT IF I COULD ALSO ASK THE SPONSOR TO MAKE SURE THAT IS THE EXACT PRECISE LANGUAGE THAT THE WORLD VERY GOOD YES LET'S LET'S GO LET'S GO TO THE LINES BACKED- TO MISS FORSBERG NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT AGAIN HERE BUT- WE'RE PUTTING ONIONS. YOU WILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. THANK CHARACTER WASN'T SURE WHEN YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THE MOMENTS THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S THE AGREEMENT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE- OVER THE SUMMER TOO. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. OKAY GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR LATE STAGE WORK HERE TO TRY TO GIVE MEMBERS SOMETHING CLEAR TO VOTE ON HIS PUSH JUST DOUBLE THAT I WANTED TO. TRY TO LAND SOME LANGUAGE SO RELEASE HEADED DIRECTIONAL FOCUS HERE- NOW WE GO TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE DIE S. SERIGNE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DIED SIMPLY WANTED TO THINK IT'S A MEMBER FOR THE BILL AND- ANYTIME A BILL. IS GOING TO REQUIRE A CODE SECTION TO REQUIRE THE NATIONAL RESOURCES SECRETARY TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING. I SIMPLY WANTED TURNED OVER FROM THE GOOD SENATOR AND FORMER SECRETARY. ONE SINCE. IT IS NO I'M INDIFFERENT TO THAT NOW. I HAD A QUICK QUESTION AND THEN A COMET THE QUESTION IS I READ THE ANALYSIS IT IT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MEASURE THE OUTCOMES OF THE AGREEMENTS WHAT WILL THAT BE PART OF SOME EXISTING MEASURING PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTUALLY IS DONE OUT OF THESE AGREEMENTS THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION IF I MAY TURN TO THE WITNESS- FOR THAT- POLICE IN THE MIST YES. PLEASE GREAT THANKS. YES WE WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONNECT IT INTO US BEFORE FIFTY SIX AND- YOUR BILL TO HELP ESTABLISH A- ACTION PLAN WITH MEASURABLE GOAL. I OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO SAY GREAT TO THAT SO. THAT'S GOOD AND THEN I THINK THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT BUT IT IS IT SOMETHING WE SHOULD JUST CHECK OVER THE BREAK TO IF WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE SOMETHING FROM THE COMMENT I WAS GOING TO MAKE. I REALLY APPRECIATED THE ANALYSIS FOR POINTING OUT- THAT 57% OF THE FORCE TO THE LANDS ARE UNDER FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND CALIFORNIA. AND IT MADE ME CRAZY DURING THE LAST NATIONAL MINISTRATION BUT SOMEHOW WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING WHEN. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WAS OF FORCE LAND WAS UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL. AND THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DESIGNED. ONE ONE SIDE IS UP FISCALLY AND THE OTHER IS IT PROPER TO MOVE IN AND SORT OF DO THINGS FOR THE OTHER SIDE WHEN THEY CAN'T DO IT AND- AT THE TIME I THINK. GOVERNOR NEWSOM TOOK OFFICE- SOMETHING LIKE FORTY FIVE OR FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY FOR FOREST. MANAGEMENT OR FUELS MANAGEMENT WANT FEDERAL LANDS UNDER THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE WERE REACHING AN WHERE THEY WORKED A STEPPING UP. THEN SO THESE AGREEMENTS WERE THERE TO DO THAT IN THIS BILL JUST PROVIDE STRUCTURE THAT DIDN'T EXIST STRUCTURE AND GOALS AND ALLOWS TRIBES TO BE INVOLVED. WHICH IS GREAT SO I'M GOING TO. BE HAPPY TO SUPPORTED IMPLANT THE STRUCTURES THERE. AND I THINK IT CALLS ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS CLEARLY THAT THERE ARE THESE GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS AND THAT. IT IS A WAY FOR DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO WORK TO DO IT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL. THAT AT THE. RIGHT MOMENT- POWER MOVEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATORS FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- SEVERAL STATES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM TO GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY PROGRAM. AND THEY'VE PROVEN- A LOT OF SUCCESS SO IT'S TIME FOR US IN CALIFORNIA TO DO THE SAME SO IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK WITH YOU AWESOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE'LL RECOGNIZE THAT IS A MOTION AND- AND I WOULD JUST. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS- AS THE STATE. PROPOSED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN. AND TAKE CARE OF ITS LANDS ALSO HOPING THAT OUR GOOD NEIGHBORS. TO THE EAST THAT WE GET SOME KIND OF PARTNERSHIP- FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE TOO BUT I THINK THESE FRAMEWORKS GONNA REALLY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN SO. PROCEDURE WORK HERE AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON. ON THE ON SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS WE NEED WE NOTED HERE IN- NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COME TO LIGHT A CLOSE- I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER- SO THE MOTION. IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CHIEF CONSULTANT. PILOT M. EIGHT A. B. SIX NINE SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN. HI BURN ALL RIGHT JONES ALAN. ALAN ON EIGHT EIGHT WOMEN EIGHT MEN ALL RIGHT GROOVE HERZBERG BOYS SO LAYERED HI LIZARD ALL RIGHT LET ALONE. OKAY FOR VOTES WILL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SENATORS. VERY GOOD- I THINK LAST. NIGHT LAST UPLOAD FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE. MR MATHIS YOU ARE HERE. WELCOME SIR. MEMBERS THIS IS A B. SEVEN FIVE FOUR FIVE ITEM NUMBER NINE. THANK YOU A SIMILAR PROCEDURE IF YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. GOOD MORNING. SOON TO BE AFTERNOON STILL IN THE MORNING GOOD DAY CHAIR AND SENATORS. ABC SEVEN FIFTY FOUR. ALLOWS A LOCAL AGENCY OR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY TO REQUEST A ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS EXTENSION FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WHEN SUBMITTING A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN. AS THE SERGEANTS HAVE HANDED OUT. I HAVE LANGUAGE DRAFTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE DIRECTOR MAY. GRANT AN EXTENSION ONLY IF AN AGENCY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SIGNUP PROCESS WAS DELAYED DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL SUBMIT THIS AMENDMENTS. SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF THE COMMITTEE. THE CENTERS I FEEL THAT IS IMPORTANT TO DO SOME CLARIFICATIONS ON THIS BILL. THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME CONFUSION REGARDING THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO LET ME CATEGORICALLY CLARIFY SEVERAL POINTS. THE DIRECTOR. OF D. W. R. DOES SENT HALF THE GRANT THE EXTENSION. THE DIRECTOR CAN REFUSE THE EXTENSION. ONCE AGAIN THE EXTENSION IS OPTIONAL AND IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE IN NEED. ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR PLANS DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. THIS BILL IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY SIGMAR REQUIREMENTS IN ANY WAY. IN THE LONG TERM. THIS WILL STRENGTHEN SIGMA GIVING AGENCIES A BRIEF PERIOD TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF CODE NINETEEN AND ALLOW. THOSE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP A MORE ACCURATE. THOUGHT OUT THOROUGH AND EFFECTIVE PLANT. MY OFFICE REACHED OUT TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. WHO SAID AN EXTENSION CANNOT BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE EMAIL AND THE IN YOUR BRIEF. WHICH IS DRESSED. TO CONSULTANT AND AS WELL IN REGARD TO LETTER DIRECTOR ERIN HAS INQUIRED ABOUT D. W. O. OURS FORTY TWO ADMINISTRATIVELY PROVIDE AN EXTENSION. THE DUE DATE IN STATUTE PERIOD WE CANNOT PERIOD AN EXTENSION WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE TO EXISTING LAW PERIOD HOPE THIS IS USEFUL TO YOU BOTH. FROM CASEY SMACKED DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. RIGHT NOW THE SIGNAL REQUIRES PUBLIC OUTRAGE THIS IS A PROBLEM IN RURAL AREAS AS WE ALL KNOW THIS WE ADDRESSED THE STATE'S RURAL BROADBAND PROBLEMS. PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH IS KEY TO SICK MUST PROCESS. NOW. IN THE WATER CODE. UNDER SECTION. ONE THREE THIS TWENTY THREE CAL CODE RED X. THREE FIVE FOUR POINT ONE ZERO NOTICING COMMUNICATIONS. IF YOU ADD A SECTION B. WITHIN THE CODE. WHEN IT DISCUSSES WHAT EACH PLAN. I SHALL INCLUDE IN THEIR SUMMARY THAT THEY PROVIDE. BE A LIST OF PUBLIC MEETINGS AT WHICH THE PLAN WAS DISCUSSED. AND CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. NOTE THE WORD PUBLIC MEETINGS IT ALSO GOES DOWN INTO SECTION TWO OF THAT IDENTIFICATION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND A DISCUSSION OF HOW PUBLIC INPUT AND RESPONSES WILL BE USED. CENTERS DO A COLD READ. THESE PUBLIC MEETINGS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAPPEN. FOR OUR FOLKS IN DISADVANTAGED RURAL AREAS WHO LACK ACCESS TO INTERNET THIS IS NOT BEEN FEASIBLE OR POSSIBLE. NOW SOME DATA ON. OUR DISADVANTAGE RURAL AREAS IN THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT SIMPLY CAN DOCTOR ZOOM MEETING LIKE MANY OF US WOULD HOPE. THE DATA SHOWS MODOC COUNTY ONLY A FOUR POINT 9% OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO SPEEDS. OF TWENTY FIVE MEGABYTES SIERRA COUNTY TWO POINT 3% OF THE PUBLIC- MY COUNTY TWELVE POINT 5% ALPINE COUNTY EIGHTEEN POINT 5% WHAT OPTIONS DO THESE RURAL DISADVANTAGES COMMUNITIES HAVE. THE STATE HAS TOLD THEM THAT THEY CANNOT HAVE PUBLIC MEETINGS. BUT THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONDUCT ONLINE MEETINGS. COVERT IS STILL LIMITING THESE AGENCIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AGENCIES ARE STILL UNABLE TO COMPLETE PUBLIC OUTRAGE. REAL COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR RESIDENTS FULLY VACCINATED WHILE URBAN CENTERS ARE RECEIVING THE LION'S SHARE OF VACCINE ALLOTMENTS RURAL AREAS THE MORE CHALLENGING TIME IN GETTING THE VACCINES OUT TO THE PUBLIC. OR THE PUBLIC HAS TO TRAVEL GREATER DISTANCES TO GET VACCINATED SENATORS WE KNOW THIS. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS WE ARE PUSHING EFFORTS TO GET VACCINES OUT TO THESE AREAS. UNFORTUNATELY IN ALMOST AREAS IT'S A PROBLEM AND IT'S IS TODAY AND THEY SAID CANNOT HAVE THESE HERE. THAT ARE NOT FOR THEIR SIGNAL PLANS. OUR RURAL AREAS MAKE UP HALF. OF THE FAXING RATES IN THE ENTIRE STATE. SENATORS. OTHER BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. FRANKLY I'VE GOT SIXTEEN PAGES OF BILLS AND I'LL SPARE YOU THE TIME AND READING THROUGH ALL OF THEM THE GRANT EXTENSIONS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE FOR EVERYTHING ACROSS THE GAMBIT IN STATE LAW BECAUSE WE KNOW COVE IT HAS IMPACTED. EVERYONE. NOW WHAT. WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE. BEFORE TO DO NOTHING AS SUGGESTED. WELCOME IF WE DO NOTHING. WHAT HAPPENS. IS THE GSA'S GET PUT ON PROBATION. ACCORDING TO WATER CODE. ONE ZERO SEVEN THREE FIVE. THROUGH ONE ZERO SEVEN THREE SIX POINT SIX. THE ENTIRE SECTION GRANTS THE STATE JURISDICTION OVER A PATIENT IF THEY DETERMINE THE PLAN IS TO BE AN ADEQUATE WHICH WE KNOW THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THEIR PUBLIC HEARINGS. THIS DEFINITION IS VAGUE AND ALLOWS FOR TOTAL INTERPRETATION BY THE DEPARTMENT. THIS THEN ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO HIRE A MEDIATOR. IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS DEFICIENCIES AND THEN DEVELOP AN INTERIM PLAN. FOR THE BASIN TO OPERATE UNDER. THE INTERIM PLAN MUST DO A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A TIME SCHEDULE. FOR THE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN. I'M CURIOUS TO WHAT THE TIME SCHEDULE WOULD BE BECAUSE OF. NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE A LOOK MEETINGS. THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE A MODERN SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY RESTRICT GROUNDWATER EXTRACTIONS. AS OF THIS SIMPLY UNNECESSARY IF MY BILL WAS TO MOVE FORWARD. ALL OF THIS GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND REDUNDANT IT THE GSA APPLYING FOR THIS EXTENSION OF MY BILL SIMPLY WOULD LIKE TO GATHER ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT ON THEIR PLANS. AS REQUIRED BY THIS WATER COATS. SIR THERE'S A LOT OF CODE SECTIONS LOST MY PLACE HERE FOR SECOND. AND. SO BACK. TO THE ALTERNATIVES AGAIN PROBATION IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE. THE STATE WATER BOARD TAKES CONTROL IT COSTS MORE MONEY MORE TIME IN IS AN UNNECESSARY WASTE. A LOSS OF LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IF NOT LONGER. TO GET THE PLANS COMPLETED IF THE AGENCIES OR ON PROBATION OR IF THE STATE INTERVENES AS IF D. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES GRANTS THE EXTENSION PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. WE DO NOT NEED TO DOUBLE THE WORK FLOW. SENATORS MY TEAM AND I HAVE WORKED. WITH CONSULTANTS AND MULTIPLE COMMITTEES THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WE STARTED WITH ANY ORIGINAL VERSION. THE LAST FOUR STRAIGHT ONE YEAR EXTENSIONS ON THE SIGNAL PLANS TO RECOVER IT. THEN AMENDED THE BILL TO THE NEXT VERSION WHICH THEN IT GRANTED AND WOULD GRANT AN OPTIONAL ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS EXTENSION AT THE DIRECTION OF THE RECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. AS YOU SEEN IN YOUR FOLDERS SENATORS WE HAVE. ANOTHER AMENDMENT. THAT REFINES US EVEN FARTHER MAKING THE GSA'S PROOF THAT IT WAS COVERED RELATED IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE. TO POSSIBLY GET THE EXTENSION IF THE DIRECTOR SO CHOOSES. TO GIVE IT. HOWEVER AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY. SENATORS AGAIN I POINT YOU TO THE PREVIOUS EMAIL FOR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SAYS THAT. THE CHANGING EXISTING LAW WOULD BE NECESSARY. AND TO THE ARGUMENTS THAT I'VE JUST MADE. SENATORS OUR LOCAL IN SMALL DISTRICTS AND AGENCIES SUPPORT THIS BILL. THIS ISN'T A CART LAUNCH FOR ALL AGENCIES. THIS IS JUST FOR THE AGENCIES IMPACTED BY COVERED NINETEEN AND WHICH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DEEMS AN EXTENSION IS NECESSARY. IS FOR GOOD FAITH ACTORS. THE SIMPLE FACT IS THAT THE GSA'S WHAT TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE ADEQUATE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. PLEASE DO NOT DEPRIVE THEM OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. ANY QUESTIONS CAN BE DIRECTED AT OUR LEAD WITNESS GERRY BYRNE SUPERVISOR FIFTH DISTRICT MODOC COUNTY WHO SHOULD BE ON THE LINE AS WILLIS SAID NAWG. FROM RC RC THANK YOU VERY GOOD WILL TURN TO YOUR- THE SPORT WITNESSES ON THE LINE PLEASE PROCEED. HELLO THIS IS GERRY BYRNE AND A THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. AGAINST THE BUYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF A. B. SEVEN FIFTY FOUR I'M HERE REPRESENTING NOT ONLY BOTOX AND LASSEN BUT OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION THAT THAT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO PREPARE THE REQUIRED YES HE'S BEEN HAMPERED BY OUR ABILITIES TO BE SEEN MEETING FOR PUBLIC INPUT IS REQUIRED BY THE LAW SHE DIDN'T COPE WITH ENVIRONMENT VERY POOR INTERNET. OR CELL SERVICE ARE REQUESTED NOT BECAUSE WE WON'T HAVE THE PLAN DONE IN TIME WE'RE ALREADY TWO CHAPTERS ELEVEN AND TWELVE I REQUESTED BECAUSE WE WANT A PLAN THAT PROVIDES THE BEST SOLUTION FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. AND TO BUILD THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. BIDDING IN SOCCER. IT MAY BE HARD TO FATHOM HOW THERE CAN BE NO AVAILABLE BROADBAND AND PORTED NONEXISTENT SELF SERVICE IN MAJOR PARTS OF OUR COUNTY. THAT IS THE CASE. I HAVE A QUICK ANSWER TO THE ARGUMENT PUT FORTH BY THE OPPONENTS. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY FOURTH ALL THE EFFORTS. LOOKING AT THE TIME AND MONEY ALREADY INVESTED IN THE TIME FRAME TO REACH AN pIS NOT. UNREASONABLE TO ASK FOR TO GET THE BEST PRODUCT POSSIBLE. YOU ALLOWING FOR AN EXTENSION WAS OPEN INCREASE COSTS. NO GSA WOULD BE FORCED TO ASK FOR AN EXTENSION. TO THE CONTRARY COSTS AND BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC WOULD BE HEAVILY WEIGHED BEFORE SUCH A REQUEST WAS MADE. THREE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CAN ALREADY GRANT A HUNDRED NINETY DAY EXTENSION THAT REALLY IS AN ACCURATE. PUTTING A BASIN PROBATIONARY STATUS IS NOT THE SAME THING AS AN EXTENSION. NO ONE WANTS THE PROBLEMS THAT COME ALONG WITH PROBATIONARY STATUS. AT THE DERBY ARE REP TOLD ME THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE SOLUTION FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. FOUR WE NO LONGER NEED THIS BILL TO GET A STATUS OPEN. ALTHOUGH COVERED RESTRICTIONS ARE LESSENING IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE THIS IS NOT THE CASE DURING MOST OF THE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. ALSO ROLL POPULATION VACCINE RATES LAG BEHIND URBAN AREAS MAKING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THE BIGGER CHALLENGE. PAPER REQUIRES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF DIVERSE GROUPS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN NOT JUST FOR THE LAST TWO CHAPTERS. IF A DOCTOR THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION WOULD PROVIDE A SAFETY NET FOR COUNTIES. IF WHEN WE GO TO ADOPT THE PLAN. WE HAVE OUR BOARDROOMS FULL OF DISGRUNTLED RESIDENTS WHO RIGHTLY SAY THEY WERE NOT PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY. SET IN LINE TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PUBLIC INPUT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUR CONCERNS UNDER CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR. NEXT. THANK YOU KAREN SENATORS SPECIFIC DOG WITH RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA THE TESTIMONY OF SUPERVISOR BURN IS REPRESENTATIVE OF OTHER RURAL COUNTIES WHO ARE IN SIMILAR POSITIONS TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IT OVER THE DEVELOPING THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AS EARLY AS LAST FALL THESE BRKEN HE'S REACHED OUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT IN OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS INFORMING THEM OF ONGOING CHALLENGES AND SEEKING POTENTIAL EMERGENCY RELIEF THEN. HOWEVER THE LIMITATIONS ARE COUNTING SPACES ULTIMATELY WANTED TO WALK AND WE THANK YOU FAMILY MEMBERS TARGETED AND REASONABLE WELL ALLOWED TO W. OR THE DISCRETION EXTEND THE DEADLINE FOR A LIMITED PERIOD IT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL STANCE IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING PROCESS FOR GSA FROM COUNTIES BUT THE BLUEPRINT BEING DRAWN IN REAL TIME OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO INTEREST ABOUT THE BEST PLANS POSSIBLE NOT TO JUST MEET THE LETTER OF THE LAW BUT TO GET THE LOCAL POLITICAL BY NEAR DALTON WE MAKE THESE PLANS WORK. AT THE JUNCTION OF WE BELIEVE SOME EXTRA MONTHS TO COMPLETE ROBUST PLANS WITH MEANINGFUL PUBLIC PROCESS PREFERABLE TO COMPLICATED COSTLY DUPLICATIVE AND POTENTIALLY PUNITIVE ALTERNATIVES SHOULD KNOW WAS WIDELY WRITTEN WITH AN AMPLE IMPLEMENTATION HORIZONS AND RC RC BELIEVES THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR A MERITED ADJUSTMENT IN THE FACE OF AGAIN UNPRECEDENTED. CIRCUMSTANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR- OTHER INSTEAD OF THE- THE TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM SEE NO.

AS NOTED I HAVE SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THAT MUCH AS DOES THE CHAIR AND A NUMBER OF YOU. AND OUT OF THE YEAR CHIEF CONSULTANT. AND HIS ANALYSIS GET THAT EXACTLY RIGHT. FIRST IT WAS THE DROUGHT WE EXPERIENCE FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AT MAINE THANK MY POSSIBLE NOW WE FACE ANOTHER DEVASTATING DROUGHT IT'S NOW TIME TO BACK THAT'LL SECOND SEGMENT GAVE MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN SEVEN YEARS TO THE MET THEIR GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN TWO MORE YEARS THAN HIGH PRIORITY BASINS. THAT'S MORE THAN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME THIRD SHOULD A GSA NOT SUBMIT ITS PLAN ON TIME CIGNA GIVE DISCRETION TO THE STATE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL AGENCY TO GET ITS PLANNED DONE WITHIN A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OF THE DEADLINE OF JANUARY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN OTHER WORDS UP HERE VIRTUALLY FROM NOW THE STATUTE ALREADY INCORPORATES THE FLEXIBILITY SOUGHT BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE STATE TO PUT A GSA ON PROBATION. FOR AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY SHOULD THIS BILL BECOME LAW WHAT'S NEXT REQUEST FOR DELAYS IN IMPLEMENTING BROWN WATER PLANNED DELAYS IN GETTING TO SUSTAINABILITY OTHER EXCEPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO EVEN HINT THAT WE MIGHT GO DOWN SUCH A PATH WITH THE FUTURE OF WATER CHALLENGES IN. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS WE PAY. BUT SUGGESTED A MAN CHAIN NOTHING IT WILL ONLY CREATE MORE CONFUSION AND DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM GETTING GSP IS DONE AND- THERE'S NO REASON AND NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BILL.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ERIN RODRIGUEZ WITH UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND CHONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES WHAT A LINE NUMBER NINETY SEVEN NINE SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS NOT THE EQUIVALENT CO WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAL CALLING IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE LINE NUMBER NINETY FOUR NINE FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS ALWAYS CONDUCT WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE ONE MORE WITH A LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED EURO. THE MORNING AFTER TEARING SENATORS I RAN ACROSS- ELLIOT CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER COALITION IN OPPOSITION WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SURE THERE ARE NO MORE INTO AT THIS TIME. OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO THE DAYS I WOULD JUST SAY THE OUTSET- I SINCERELY. APPRECIATE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE AUTHOR'S POSITION AND THE COUNTIES THAT HE'S FIGHTING FOR HERE AND- ANY EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTERIM TO TRY TO FIND- WHAT I WAS HOPING TO BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE SOLUTION I THINK WE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON. HOW THE EXISTING LAW WORKS- I DO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT- IN THE PACKET YOU PROVIDED THAT- D. W. R. AND EVEN THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THERE THERE ARE DEADLINES IN LOS- BUT- THERE ARE ALSO DISCRETIONARY. AUTHORITIES PROVIDED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD- THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A DATA BASE TO BE PUT IN PROBATIONARY STATUS. TO GIVE THEM DISCRETION TO- TO GO PAST THAT STATUTORY DEADLINE SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE PLACED ON PROBATIONARY STATUS. TO MEET THAT DEADLINE I BELIEVE THE ANALYSIS STATES- IT'S THAT THIS THIS SPECIFICALLY STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AFTER NOTICING A PUBLIC HEARING- MAY DESIGNATE A HIGHER MEDIUM PRIORITY BASIN AS A PROBATIONARY BASIN IF THE BOARD FINDS CERTAIN CONDITIONS A CERTAIN SITUATIONS APPLIED TO THE BASIN- AND BUT IF THE IF THAT BASIN HAS BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH- AND PROVIDES A PLAN AFTER THE DEADLINE SO YOU ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AS YOU'RE PROPOSING NOTHING IN LAW REQUIRES THEM TO PUT ON PROBATIONARY STATUS. TO ACCEPT THAT AND THERE'S- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS BROADCASTED BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A- AND- VIOLATION PROVISION IN STATUTE WHERE THERE'S A FIFTY OR SOME OTHER KIND OF PENALTY- AUTOMATICALLY IMPOSE THIS IS ALL LEFT IN THE DISK THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD. I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY YOU KNOW THEY'RE WITHIN THE MEDIUM BASINS I THINK THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTY THREE BASINS WITH THEIR PLANS DO IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE TODAY. ABOUT NINETY PLANS ARE ON THEIR WAY AND AFTER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD VERY TENSE IN THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF TO LAND- ONE OF THESE PLANS ARE WITHIN THE BASIN OR MULTIPLE PLANS WITHIN THE BASIN UNDER SIGMA. AND I RECOGNIZE THE TENSION AND- THAT THAT THAT- ELEVATES BUT- THE DROUGHT NECESSITATES US TO ACTUALLY TRY TO GET TO SOME SUSTAINABILITY WHICH IS THE ENTIRE DESIGN OF SIGMUND THE FIRST PLACE. SO MY CONCERN ABOUT THE LEGISLATION AT THIS POINT IS THAT IT FOR RE OPENING SIGMA. FOR JUST A HANDFUL OF MEDIUM BASINS- THAT ALREADY HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS WITH STATE WATER BOARD- AND THEN AS THE GREAT CALIFORNIA GROUNDWATER ASSOCIATION NOTES- THAT THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ALL THESE OTHER GSA'S BEEN WORKING TOWARDS THE EXISTING DEADLINES FOR FIVE YEARS. IT'S NOT THE TIME TO POSTPONE OR DELAY THIS THIS NECESSARY WORK SO- APPRECIATE YOU WORKING HARD AT IT I DO NOT WANT- I KNOW YOU WANT THIS BILL TO GO UP FOR A VOTE I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT. TODAY BUT I DON'T WANT THIS TO BIAS IN ANY WAY- THE APPLICATIONS OR THE CONDITIONS IS THAT YOUR- PARTICULAR. REGIONS OF GONE THROUGH ANY OF THESE COUNTIES WE DO WE DON'T WANT THIS HEARING TO ANYWAY BUYS THAT APPLICATION AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY IMPLICATION OF BAD FAITH ON THEIR PART. I TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD THAT THEY'VE HAD HUGE CHALLENGES AND WE ALL KNOW RURAL BROADBAND'S AN ISSUE AND- SO. NO NO DISPUTE ON THE HARDSHIPS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH I JUST I THINK THERE'S WE HAVE TO BE. INCREDIBLY CAREFUL ABOUT. RE OPENING SIGNAL WHEN YOU ENTER THIS BILL DOES NOT REOPEN SIGMA I UNDERSTOOD EARLIER I GET THAT I MEAN. I'M JUST STATING MY RATIONALE FOR RE OPENED SIGMA GRANTS UNDERSTOOD. OUR MAN. DIRECTOR YOU TOO COLD. TO GRANT THE EXTENSION VERSUS DOING PROBATION. UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE'S NOT A CODE SECTION. THAT SAYS THEY WON'T PUT THEM IN PROBATION IT IS IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR. SO WHY WOULD WE NOT DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE RIGHT LIKE WE'VE DONE. AND HUNDREDS OF OTHER BILLS THIS YEAR DUE TO COPE ED. TWO VERY SPECIFICALLY CLARIFY WHAT OUR INTENTIONS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ARE. RIGHT BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS WEREALLY EVEN IN THE AIR SENATOR. SEE THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE NOT CHANGED AT LINES- THE CLEAN AIR ACT OUTLINES OF NOT CHANGED. THE CLEAN WATER DEADLINES HAVE NOT CHANGED. THE SCOPING PLAN DEADLINES HAVE NOT CHANGED I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND EIGHT AND I SAW YOUR FILE. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THAT I THINK THERE'S ADMINISTRATIVE RECOURSE. TO A TAXI THAT DEADLINE IF THEY'RE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH AND I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP DOING SO AND HAVING THAT OPEN DIALOGUE AND BRINGING THAT WORK FOR. THE STATE WATER BOARD ANYMORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER ASSISTANCE IS NECESSARY WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT THAT- THROUGH D. W. ARE IN SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS OUT THERE- SO. I KNOW WE'VE GOT A WE'VE SORT OF HIT AN IMPASSE ON THIS ONE AND I DO COMPLETELY RESPECT YOUR YOUR POINT OF VIEW BUT- THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M- GONNA BE AT TODAY SO- CANNOT BE RECOMMENDING SUPPORT AT THIS POINT AND- WILL BE OPPOSING LEGISLATION AND- AS IT'S BEEN PUT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE BUT- MORE THAN WILLING TO. ACCEPT OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS- AS NECESSARY. MANY OTHERS YES MY STRUCTURE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN OF THE FROM THE MEMBERS HAVE COMMON SENSE- YOU KNOW I CAN HOLD OFF ON MAKING A MOTION THAT YOU KNOW JUST BASED ON. THE WITNESS TESTIMONY AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THE REASONABLE NOUS OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS YOU KNOW SEEMS LIKE A- PRETTY MINOR. THING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO OFFER- TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS SO I'D BE WILLING TO MAKE THE MOTION FOR SUPPORT. THANKS FOR THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OR MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT AND THAT IS THAT- IF THE- I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT THERE ARE REMEDIES DID EXIST WITHOUT DOING THIS BILL THE THING THAT I SAID IN A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR GIVEN ANOTHER BILL I'M DOING WITH SIMILAR DEADLINES IS IN THAT BILL I'M NOT MOVING THE DEADLINES I AM OVER ONLY DEALING WITH THE ENFORCEMENT THAT EXISTS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD DUE TO SOME OF THE SIMILAR FACTORS THAT AND THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ROUTE TO GO HERE. BECAUSE I THINK- MR DICKINSON- NAILED IT IN HIS- TESTIMONIES THERE'S BEEN SEVEN YEARS UP TO THIS FOR FIVE YEARS AND IT DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE BASE AND- HE PIANO WE JUST NEED TO AS I SAID IN AN EARLIER BLL TODAY- I THOUGHT THE COMPROMISES THAT WERE MADE IN SEGMENT THE TIME MOVED IT OUT FARTHER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THAT SO IF THE MOTION IS MADE I WILL VOTE NO I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE I DON'T THINK THERE'S- A NEED TO MOVE THE DEADLINES OF SEGMENT SELF. SO I GUESS I'LL DEFER TO THE AUTHOR WHETHER YOU DO IT THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE A MOTION I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE COMMITTEE AT LEAST NOT THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE BUT- LEAVES YOUR DISCRETION MR CHAIRMAN AS I TOLD YOU PREVIOUSLY I WAS. COMPLETELY HAPPY AND OPEN TO MAKING ANY ME ANY AMENDMENTS NECESSARY. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IF THE ROUTE AS CENTER LAYERED SAID WAS TO CHANGE IT TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THAT I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT. AS I STATED IN MY TESTIMONY WE'VE AMENDED THIS BILL MULTIPLE TIMES. AND IF THE BILL IS UNABLE TO GET OUT TODAY I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION SO WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK. AT A DIFFERENT ROUTE OF AMENDMENTS. MY NUMBER ONE THING IS THAT THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES. THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET THAT HAVE BEEN HIT BY COVE IT DO NOT DESERVE TO GET PUNISHED. BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT WERE COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR CONTROL THAT IS MY GOAL HERE. IT'S NOT TO GIVE MORE MORE EXTENSIONS AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND MAKE AN UNFAIR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHAT'S UNFAIR IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS. THAT THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARDER THAN ANY OTHER AREAS THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING THE SAME RESOURCES. SO IT'S MY GOAL THAT THIS BODY. REALIZES THAT IN GIVES THEM THE HELP. THEY NEED WE'VE WRITTEN THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THEY'RE WORTHY OF IT AND THAT THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS IN THE DISCRETION IS STILL OPEN TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S CURRENT LAW ALREADY STATES. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE GOING INTO A PROBATION APPROVED WE SHOULDN'T PUNISH THEM BECAUSE THEY LACK ACCESS. THAT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL BETTER THAN I UNDERSTOOD SEARCH- YES SO I'M SOME HEARING A WILL. OF A PREFERENCE TO HAVE A MOTION MADE IF IT DOES IF IT FAILS S. RECONSIDERATION OF THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKING ON THE ISSUES THAT SEEM LIKE THE- IDEAL OKAY I JUST WANT ONE IDEAL IDEAL I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WITH US COLLEAGUES ON THE DIETS THAT. IF MR LAYERED WAS CONSIDERING A MOTION DIFFERENT THAN MINE I'M- I DIDN'T BUT I DIDN'T PICK THAT UP BUT THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT TO ME. NO I THINK THAT WAS THE DIRECTION I WAS HOPING THE AUTHOR WOULD'VE TAKEN BEFORE GETTING HERE. AND HE DID MAYBE IF THIS IS DEFEATED. R. RECONSIDERATION IS NOTICED THAT HE'LL CONSIDER THAT. WITH REGARD TO MY SUGGESTION THAT WOULD BE THE PROPER. PROCESS TO FOLLOW OKAY RATHER THAN MAKING IT AND WRITES IT TO MOTION BRIDE OKAY. ENVY AGAIN SOONER OR LATER TO YOUR POINT SIR- WE DID ASK. FOR ANY AMENDMENTS ANY CHANGES. TALK THROUGH THE BILL- WE WENT THROUGH A TWO WEEK PROCESS OF THAT AND THAT'S WHAT MY STAFF REACHED OUT WHICH IS WHERE WE HAVE THE EMAIL- TALKING ABOUT MY STAFF MEMBER MY LEISURE ACTOR BENJAMIN. OKAY SO DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOTION FOR FILLING THE MOTION FOR APPROVAL AS AS IS PRESENT TODAY OKAY UNLESS THE NUMBER ONE CHENNAI WITHDRAWALS YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. OKAY WHAT. I THINK WE'RE GOOD OKAY SO JUST TO CATCH YOU UP- THE AUTHOR WISHES AT THE BUILDING COULD BE UP FOR A VOTE SO THERE'S GONNA BE A WITCH WITH OR WITHOUT THE MENACE ON THE BILL. FIGURE FOR US IN THE COMMITTEE NOT NOT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HANDED BY THE AUTHOR. MISTER MISTER CHAIR. BUT JUST JUST THE BILL AS IS PRESENTED THE COMMITTEE WILL BE PROPOSED I'LL BE VOTING NO HI OKAY- AND- BUT IT. ENDED UP UPON RECONSIDERATION YEAH HE HE'S GONNA SEE THAT'S RECONSIDERATION. CAN I ASK FOR RULES CLARIFICATION ON THE DOOR. I'M SORRY YES- IF WE VOTE AND IT FAILS AND IT'S OFFERED RECONSIDERATION THIS IS THE LAST HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS THAT CORRECT WE'RE IN A REAL WAY THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ALREADY REVIEWED. WOULD IT BE BETTER FOR THE AUTHOR TO OFFER TWO. TWO YEAR THE BILL. RATHER THAN TAKE THE VOTE TODAY AND- WE CAN'T TO YOUR THE BILL BECAUSE THE DEADLINE FOR SIGMA'S JANUARY. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. I SUPPOSE IS AN URGENCY MEASURE THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING THAT. WOULD DEFY THE COMMITTEE RIGHT A LINE PROCESS OF IT THANK YOU TO MAYBE ONE CHANGE THEY CAN MAKE A RECONSIDERATION BUT- PENSION WE TAKE THAT AS A MOTION YES. OKAY SO IT'S A MOTION FROM THE VICE CHAIR- YOU WANT TO TREAT YOUR LAST COMMENT YOUR CLOTHES OR DO YOU WANT TO. DO BUT ONE MORE. AGAIN SENATORS IS THIS IS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXTREMELY RURAL AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HAVE I COPE WITH THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN ABLE TO MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS. FOR THEIR GS FEES AS LABELED. INK IN THE WATER BECAUSE THE WI FOR FORWARD. THEY THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO DO SO. AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THE DO NOTHING APPROACH HERE TODAY TO ALLOW THEM TO GO TO A PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT THAT MEANS BUT- IN A WATER CODE AS WATER CODE AND WHEN IT SAYS PROBATION NIGHT I TAKE THAT AS TO MEAN. PROBATION SO WE CAN EITHER GIVE THEM THIS ABILITY. TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO SHOW GOOD FAITH TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE AFFECTED BY COLD IT. OR WE PUT HIM ON PROBATION CENTERS THE CHOICE IS YOURS THANK YOU. OKAY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT HOW THE LAW WORKS BUT APPRECIATE THAT WILL ACCEPT THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES- CHIEF CONCERN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PILOT ON NINE A. B. SEVEN FIFTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS STERN. NO BURN NODE JONES JONES HI ALAN. ALAN NO EGGMAN FIGMA NO GROVE HURTS BERG. OKAY SO LAYERED NO NO WHERE DOES IT LIVE ON. OKAY WE'LL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND SHOULD IT FAIL WE WILL- WE WILL LOOK FOR A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S OKAY. RIGHT THE. RIGHT YOU CAN NOTICE RECONSIDERATION RIGHT SO WILL NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL UNDERTAKE A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION. ON RETURN- THE LAST ITEM UP IN HEARING HERE- I NUMBER TEN. SENATOR MOLAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AB EIGHT NINE SEVEN WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF WE THOUGHT FOR WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO APPROVE THE BILL LIKE GRATEFULLY ACCEPT THE OMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS ESTIMATED TO DO SO WELL INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CURRENT AND PROJECTED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING CREASE TEMPERATURE SEA LEVEL RISE INCREASED WILDFIRES ALTERED PRECIPITATION PATTERNS EXCESSIVE FLOODING IN MORE MANY IMPACTS WILL VARY BASED ON THE COMMITTEE'S COMMUNITIES PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS WHICH TEND TO EXTEND BEYOND CITY OR COUNTY BOUNDARIES. THIS MAKES REGIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN AND AMONG LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS A VITAL COMPONENT OF THOROUGH RESILIENCY PLANNING SOME LOCAL ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE A BEGUN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HOWEVER MANY ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEGUN COORDINATING THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR PREPAREDNESS WITH ADJACENT ENTITIES IN THE REGION AND SOME OF. NOT BEGUN PLANNING AT ALL DUE TO THE LACK OF COORDINATED PLANNING THE STATE'S CURRENT MECHANISM FOR FUNDING ADAPTATION PROJECTS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY PIECEMEAL WITH NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATING ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. RESILIENCY RETURN. THE EIGHT NINETY SEVEN SO TO FILL THIS GAP BY ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING REGIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING THAT BUILDS UPON AND ENHANCES LOCAL ADAPTATION ACTIONS TO REDUCE CLIMATE RISKS. FOSTERING COLLABORATION AMONG LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE ENTITIES ON ADAPTATION SOLUTIONS AND FINALLY DEVELOPING GUIDANCE FOR POTENTIAL STATE FEDERAL OR PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND FUNDING REGIONAL PRIORITY ADAPTATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY VIA FOUND BRUCE RIORDAN WITH THE BAY AREA CLIMATE ADAPTATION NETWORK.

TO CREATING THAT STRONG CALIFORNIA ADAPTATION PROGRAM IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE STATE RIGHT NOW YOU SEE CITIES COUNTIES WATER DISTRICTS ARE REALLY BASED ORGANIZATION TRIBES THEY'RE ALREADY TAKING ACTION TO BUILD LOCAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE. EIGHT NINE SEVEN THE GREAT PROMISE THAT IT WILL BUILD UPON THESE PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS AND TIE THEM TOGETHER CHINESE INITIATIVES TOGETHER IF WE CAN COMBINE. LOCAL ADAPTATION EFFORTS WITH REAL COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL PLANNING NOT JUST GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT UNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACADEMICS ARE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER NETWORKS AND OTHERS IF WE CAN COMBINE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS. WITH SUBSTANTIAL STATE FUNDING SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE WE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE FORWARD AT THE SPEED AND THE SCALE REQUIRED WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO BECOME THE GLOBAL LEADER ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION OR RESILIENCE WE ARE NOT THAT GLOBAL LEADER TODAY BUT IF WE PLANNED.

MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE SHOWING UP IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME OKAY VERY GOOD- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DIS I'LL JUST SAY THE OUTSET AND THEN I'LL TURN TO MEMBERS- YOU MEMBERS YOU CAN FIND THE MARKUP OF THE BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR ANALYSIS IF YOU'RE CURIOUS. THE TWO CENTRAL ISSUES I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU- WORKING WITH US TO FALL THIS CONCEPT. AND YOU'VE BEEN. DILIGENTLY WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS. ONE IS HOW TO GET SMART ABOUT LEVERAGING HAZARD MITIGATION DOLLARS IN THIS SPACE WE KNOW THE PLANNING IS IMPORTANT BUT WE KNOW THAT THE SCALE OF THE MONEY THAT'S NEEDED TO BE INVESTING HERE. IS STRICTLY OVERWHELMING AND- THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT TO GET THE STATE TO PLACE A RESILIENCE. IS NOT IN THE EIGHTEEN OF SINGLE DIGIT BILLIONS BUT IS. GOING TO BE A MULTI HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR EFFORT WITH YOU MOVINGA TRAIN LINE FROM FALLING INTO THE SEA FOR AN AIRPORT THAT'S ABOUT TO GO UNDER WATER OR WHOLE REGION FROM BURNING DOWN FROM WILDFIRE. IT IS ALL HANDS ON DECK. I APPRECIATE YOU INCORPORATING SOME OF THOSE ELEMENTS AND REFERENCES TO HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE AND- AND- YES IS IT AS A- CRITICAL PARTNER. WITH OPR IN THIS EFFORT. IF WE CAN LEVERAGE FEMA DOLLARS AND LOOK FOR OTHER CREATIVE FEDERAL KIND OF FUNDS TO FRONT LOAD SOME OF THIS. PROJECT WORK I THINK WE CAN GET A LOT DONE AND IF THE PLANNING IS SORT OF GOING TOWARDS FINANCING IN MIND. I THINK IT'S VERY EXCITING- I KNOW IT'S AN ELEMENT IN OUR BUDGET. DISCUSSIONS AS WELL HERE TOO. THE OTHER PIECE IT WAS JUST I APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION OF. SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF- GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES AND COUNTY SIZES AND- A MULTI YOU KNOW. SACKED DELTA OR BAY AREA ELEMENT MAY HAVE NINE COUNTIES INVOLVED. WHEN YOU HAVE A COUNTY OF ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES- IT MAY NOT EVEN BE A MULTI COUNTY EFFORT IT MAY JUST BE A MATTER OF GETTING LA ITSELF. TO DO THAT KIND OF- INTRA REGIONAL PLANNING- SAN DIEGO FOR INSTANCE WAS NOTED- IN THE LAST ADAPTATION PLANS AS- A REGION UNTO ITSELF- SO. WITH SOME OF THOSE LARGER LAND MASS IN COUNTIES. I APPRECIATE YOU YOU WORKING THROUGH THAT WITH US AND- HOPING TO GET- MORE THAT SUPPORT ON ONTO YOUR BILL WITH THIS FRAMEWORK SO. WANT TO WORK WITH YOU GOING FORWARD ON THAT AND TRY TO GET. LOS ANGELES VENTER- THE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARD DINO IS ALL THOSE FOLKS. ENGAGE BECAUSE I CAN THIS IS A REALLY SMART KERRY- TO TRY TO GET FOLKS WORKING TOGETHER AND WE'RE NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH SO- THAT'S MY QUICK TO SENSE. WHAT IS ENTERTAINMENT AND THEN TO SENATORS LAYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M A TEACHER AND I JUST A MONTH SO IT'S NICE TO SEE MY FRIEND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND MOVE THIS BILL. VERY GOOD WE HAVE A MOTION CENTER LATER ON. I HAVE A COMMENT AND THEN A QUESTION. EXCUSE ME AND THAT THAT COMMENT IS OUT THANKS FOR DOING THIS BECAUSE THE WHOLE QUESTION IS ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS. IN RESILIENCY AND ADAPTATION AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS BILL. REALLY DECIDES AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AS IT DID IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION DO EXECUTIVE ORDER PUT IT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY COMPLETELY BUT I DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THAT HUNT ANYMORE. IT AND SO THERE ARE STILL AS THE CHAIR NOTED MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT I MEAN. WE SUPERVISED THE FORCE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT AND THE SAFEGUARDING PLANNED SAFEGUARDING PLAN IS REFERENCED HERE. BUT MY QUESTION IS NORMALLY THE ANALYSIS WAS RELATED BILLS THAT ARE MOVING OR MOVED IN AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE. BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS AND THE PRO TEM HAS A BILL. SENATE BILL ONE THAT ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATES REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES OR OR SOME KIND OF REGIONAL EFFORT WITH REGARD TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE PARALLEL HERE. ARE YOUR DOING COLLABORATIVE'S ALL OVER THE STATE WITH REGARD TO RESILIENCY AND HER BILL WAS DOING IT- WITH REGARD TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND I WONDERED IF YOU. JUST COMMIT OVER THE BREAK TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEHOW. THOSE FIFTY. BECAUSE BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T BE JUST MOVING AHEAD WITH TWO DIFFERENT. STRUCTURES ABOUT A PIECE OF THE SAME ISSUE. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR- AND TOTALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT- WE THINK THIS BILL IS COMPLEMENTARY TO S. B. Y. AND- AS IT WILL PROVIDE A STATE- GUIDANCE FOR THE REGIONAL ADAPTATION PLANNING ISSUE ONCE FOCUSING ON PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THAT REGARD- IN THE RESPONSE TO C. LEVEL RISE BUT I SEE IT IS IT AS COMPLEMENTARY BUT IF THERE ARE IF THERE IF IT IS COMPLEMENTARY EXCUSE ME. MISTER CHAIR IT IS COMPLEMENTARY BUT IT DOES SET UP TWO STRUCTURES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT COMPETING AND IT SEEMS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IF IT'S FIGURED OUT SO I'M JUST SUGGEST BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL UNDERSTAND HER BILL. I UST THINK YOU SHOULD WORK TOGETHER SO THAT THERE'S NOT TO COME PLEASE HAVE SOME ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT SIR. GREAT THANK YOU- WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR EGG MAN AND I WOULD SAY IN ADDITION SP ONE. THERE'S A BILL MOVING ON STATE- THE STATE HAD AT SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL- THERE WAS A BILL FROM LAST IT WAS PASSED ON TO CALTRANS PLANNING EFFORT TO GET THEM. THE WAY I SEE THIS IS. ORGANIZING THE BOTTOM UP SIDE SO THAT HE CAN LINK WITH. THE TOP DOWN WORK WORK THAT'S GOING ON IN S. P. ONES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY. LEVERAGE THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR THE- PC'S WORKER CALTRANS WORK AND SORT OF. MEMORY THE TOP DOWN FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND TRY TO GET THAT COLLABORATION ESPECIALLY BRINGING IN. VOICES THAT MAYBE HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE TABLE AS WELL I KNOW UNDER RESOURCE IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE CRITICAL THIS EFFORT TO SELL. THANKS FOR THAT- SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS A LADY CLOSER. SO LET ME JUST SAY AGAIN I THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I THINK WE'VE EMBEDDED LOCAL FLEXIBILITY HERE YET WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW ESTABLISHING THESE NETWORKS WITH FLEXIBILITY- THE CERTIFICATION OF THE PLANS AND- GETTING SORT OF THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE WHEN THE FUNDING% COMES. OUT WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO DEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY I'M JUST STRUCK BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CHALLENGE I THINK I'VE CITED THIS BEFORE BUT TO YOUR POINT. I JUST IN MY COUNTY ALONE SAN MATTEO COUNTY TWENTY FOUR BILLION WITH A B. AT RISK. WITH THE INUNDATION ZONE THE PROPERTY VALUES I MEAN THIS IS AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DOWN PAYMENT IN THE IN THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE- WHICH YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED. IN THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE. STILL THIS IS US ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS GETTING IS IN PLACE SO WHEN THE- WHEN DOLLARS CAN COMMON YES HOPEFULLY FEDERAL DOLLARS AS WELL. THEY CAN BE DEPLOYED EFFECTIVELY IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE LEADING. ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY MOST IMPORTANTLY RESILIENCY- GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU- SO THE MOTION IS.
