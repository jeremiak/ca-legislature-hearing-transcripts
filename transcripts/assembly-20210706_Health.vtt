ANYWHERE UNITED STATES. THERE

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.646

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.314
TROUBLING EXPOSE IN THE LOS

QUOTE SPAWNED A COTTAGE

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.028
INDUSTRY OF ILLEGAL PRACTICES.

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:39.929
ARE THERE WAS A SIMILAR

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.101
FOUND THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICES

VIOLATING FEDERAL GUIDELINES.

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.387

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:43.801
KAISER. THIS CREATED AN EXTREME

02:35:43.867 --> 02:35:45.302
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR ME AND

02:35:45.369 --> 02:35:47.604
MY FAMILY. HOWEVER SINCE THEN I

02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.606
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET WITH HIM

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:52.576
AS OFTEN AS I NEED TO. IN THE

02:35:52.643 --> 02:35:54.812
FIRST SIX WEEKS OF AT LEAST

02:35:54.878 --> 02:35:57.314
WEEKLY THERAPY I IMPROVED MORE

02:35:57.381 --> 02:35:57.881
THAN IN THE SIX YEARS THAT I

02:35:57.948 --> 02:36:00.350
WAS AT KAISER. I HAVEN'T NEEDED

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:02.252
WEEKLY TREATMENTS FOR SOME TIME

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:03.921
BUT IF I EXPERIENCE ANY OF MY

02:36:03.987 --> 02:36:05.522
TRAUMA COMING BACK I CAN EASILY

02:36:05.589 --> 02:36:06.657
REACH OUT TO MY THERAPIST AND

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:08.192
GET THE KIND OF CARE THAT. I

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:10.694
NEED TO MOVE THROUGH IT. EVEN

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:12.196
KNOWING THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO

02:36:12.262 --> 02:36:13.630
CARE WHEN I NEED IT MAKES ME

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:15.299
CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH

02:36:15.365 --> 02:36:15.933
PROBLEMS THAT I OTHERWISE COULD

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:19.303
NOT. I FEEL LESS AFRAID AND

02:36:19.369 --> 02:36:21.972
LESS HELPLESS. I AM EAGER AND

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:23.607
ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH WHO I AM

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.142
AND MORE COMPLICATE CONFIDENT

02:36:25.209 --> 02:36:27.044
IN NAVIGATING MY OWN LIFE AND

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:29.747
THE LIVES OF MY CHILDREN. I AM

02:36:29.813 --> 02:36:31.115

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:38.655
BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:39.456

FOR PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT IT CAN

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:49.633
LOOK LIKE. I THINK THAT PEOPLE

02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:51.368
OFTEN THINK OF MENTAL ILLNESS

02:36:51.435 --> 02:36:53.804
AS A SINGULAR INDIVIDUAL ISSUE

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:56.006
WHEN THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE.

02:36:56.073 --> 02:36:57.808
MENTAL ILLNESS IS AN ISSUE THAT

02:36:57.875 --> 02:36:59.276
AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN AND THE

02:36:59.343 --> 02:37:01.278
TRAUMA THAT THEY MAY EXPERIENCE

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:03.447
AS A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR OWN.

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:05.048
IT AFFECTS OUR FAMILY UNITS OUR

02:37:05.115 --> 02:37:06.750

02:37:09.653 --> 02:37:12.256
CANNOT STRESS THAT THIS IS WHAT

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:13.290
TRUMP PROPER TREATMENT CAN DO

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:14.925
FOR PEOPLE. IT'S WHAT IT SHOULD

02:37:14.992 --> 02:37:17.628
DO FOR PEOPLE. WE DESERVE A
