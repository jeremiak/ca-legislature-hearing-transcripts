THE UNDER THE NOOSE AROUND. I'M

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.144
WITH ALL THESE FACTORS IN MIND

INFORMATION ON THE NEW ROUND OF

FEDERALLY FUNDING. ALSO THE

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.863
SECOND COMPONENT ON THE OTHER

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.636
LIST THE THREE CORE

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.606

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I'M GOING IN

THE ORDER THAT YOU SEE THERE ON

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:41.879
THAT FIRST EXPECTATION FOR-

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.281
EQUITY. WE HAVE THE LEAST

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:45.649
AMOUNT OF CONCERN WITH THIS

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:48.552
PROPOSAL- AS NOTED IN THE STAFF

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.187
COMMENTS OF YOUR AGENDA ALL THE

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.989
SEGMENTS ALREADY HAVE. PLANS IN

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.558
PLACE TO ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.093
OTHER CERTIFICATION OF LARGELY

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.962
I RECOGNIZE THOSE EXISTING

00:39:58.028 --> 00:39:59.897
PLANS THE ONE EXCEPTION HERE IS

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.165
THAT IN THE CASE OF YOU SEE THE

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.167
EXPECTATION WOULD BE A FASTER

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:06.637
TIMELINE THAN WHAT WHAT YOU SEE

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:07.671
HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. I

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:08.272
JUST LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO SET

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.640
THIS EXPECTATION WE HAVE SOME

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.175
RECOMMENDATIONS ON ALIGNING

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.877
SOME OF THE STATE'S EXISTING

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:13.577
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.379
STUDENT OUTCOMES. TO ENHANCE

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:17.414
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:19.517
UNIVERSITY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:22.219
THIS SOME EQUITY PLAN. I'M NOT

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:22.686
SECOND VOTE ON ONLINE

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.989
EDUCATION- WE HAVE MORE

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:27.024
CONCERNS WITH THIS EXPECTATION

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:28.192
WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.094
ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO WANT

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:32.329
TO SUSTAIN EFFORTS AROUND

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.331
ONLINE EDUCATION LINE OF CODE-

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:35.232
BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.368
SPECIFIC- PROPOSED TEN

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:39.370
PERCENTAGE POINT TARGET. OTHER

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.405
TARGET APPEARS ARBITRARY TO US

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.307
LACKING IN JUSTIFICATION. IT

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:44.875
ALSO RAISES POTENTIAL TRADE

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.010
OFFS OF THE LEGISLATURE WANT

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.812
MORE INFORMATION ON TRADE OFFS

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.113
AND THINGS LIKE COSTS AND THE

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.382
IMPACT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. SO

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:52.683
THIS CASE WE RECOMMENDED

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.752
REJECTING THIS. PROPOSAL

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.253
REPLACING IT INSTEAD WITH THE

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.088
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON EACH

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.223
OF THE SEGMENTS EXPERIENCES

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.392
WITH EDUCATION. THAT WOULD GIVE

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.927
THE LEGISLATURE MORE DATA SO

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.061
THAT IT COULD MAKE MORE AND

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:08.532
MORE FOR BUDGET DECISIONS AND

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:08.999
FUTURE YEARS ON ON THE

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:10.167
EDUCATION. I'M NOT I'M NOT

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:11.869
BULLET TO ADMIT HERE WE HAVE

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.571
THE MOST CAN. AND OUR CONCERNS

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.272
AROUND- A LOT OF THE BASIC

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.441
INFORMATION THAT'S MISSING ON

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:19.276
THE NEW PATHWAY. ADMINISTRATION

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.277
HASN'T CLARIFIED HOW MANY

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.012
STUDENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.714
UNDER THE NEW PATHWAY WHICH

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:24.715
KINDA STUDENTS SO IT'S

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.783
DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THE

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.651
POTENTIAL EQUITY PATENT PACKS

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.320
OF THE NEW PATHWAY. AND IT

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.754
HASN'T CLARIFIED HOW THE NEW

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.323
PATHWAY WOULD INTERACT WITH THE

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:33.257
OTHER EXISTING TRANSFER

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.959
PATHWAYS LIKE THE EXISTING

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.727
TRANSFORMATION GUARANTEES THAT

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.762
SEVERAL UC CAMPUSES. THIS IS AN

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:39.964
AREA WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.631
COULD WORK WITH THE

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.099
ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY THESE

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.868
BASIC ISSUES AND I THINK IN

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:44.969
FAVOUR INFORMATION IS NOT

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.737
FORTHCOMING BY ANY REVISION THE

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.105
LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THIS

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.139
PROPOSAL REVISITED IN THE

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:51.208
FUTURE YOUR ONE. MORE

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.010
INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE.

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:53.944
AND THEN ON THE FINAL COMPONENT

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.913
ON A MOMENT THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.114
THE SIMPLEST ISSUE OF ALL OF

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.182
THIS ISSUE ONE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.817
NO THERE'S NO PROPOSAL HERE.

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.285
ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.686
ITS LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:05.322
NOT PROPOSING AN ENROLLMENT

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.523
TARGET FOR YOU SEE. HEARD A

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.892
STATE AND MANY PREVIOUS

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.361
HEARINGS AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.029
WE THINK THIS APPROACH IS POOR-

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:13.564
CREATES CONFUSION AS TO THE

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.032
LEGISLATURE'S EXPECTATIONS FOR

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.667
ENROLLMENT FOR YOU SEE. AND

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.535
HEAR WE RECOMMEND- SETTING A

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.104
TARGET FOR YOU SEE AND WE

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.339
RECOMMEND SETTING THAT TARGET.

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.540
FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO FOR

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:27.311
THE ACADEMIC YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.179
TO TWENTY THREE. THAT WAS-

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.247
ENSURE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:31.982
LEGISLATURE TO BETTER INFLUENCE

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.918
FOLLOWING MISSION DECISIONS.

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.052
I'M NOT A LOT OF GROUND TO

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.421
COVER AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.923
FURTHER EXPAND ENTITIES POINT

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:44.395
START. OKAY THANK YOU. LET'S

FIRST. RECEIVING THESE FUNDS

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.117
BACK IS CRITICAL TO AVOIDING

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:10.154
STEEP REDUCTIONS WHAT SERVICES-

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.388
THE RESTORATION OF THE

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:12.523
UNIVERSITY SPACE BUDGET ALLOWS

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:13.891
US TO MOVE AWAY FROM CRISIS

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.726

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:16.961

BUT THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO

MR MEDINA- I BELIEVE THE ISSUE

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:54.464
HAS TO DO WITH YOU I'M NOT A

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.266
FUNDING FOR CAMPUS STUDENTS AND

00:58:56.332 --> 00:58:58.468
HOW HE FUNDING WAS ALLOCATED

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:01.070
BETWEEN CAMPUSES- WHEN THE

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.072
STATE PROVIDES APPROPRIATIONS

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.375
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- THE

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:08.611
WAY WE DIVIDE THE FUNDING WHEN

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.480
YOU APPROPRIATE FUNDS TO US. WE

00:59:10.546 --> 00:59:12.715
PROVIDED TO OUR CAMPUSES FOR A

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:15.518
PROCESS CALLED RETENTION OF

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:17.153
FIRST FROM THOSE FUNDS YOU

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.521
PROVIDE TO US WE TAKE CERTAIN

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:20.456
PROGRAMS THAT SERVE ALL

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:23.092
STUDENTS- THOSE ARE FUNDED OFF

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.028
THE TOP THAT INCLUDES PROGRAMS

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:28.031
LIKE THEY PROP- AND CERTAIN OF

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:29.532
SYSTEM WHY PROGRAMS LIKE

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:30.566
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:33.002
STATIONS- THEN WE ALSO REMOVE

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:35.204
FINANCIAL AID- BECAUSE THAT

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:37.807
GETS DIVIDED. BETWEEN CAMPUSES

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:41.277
BASED ON STUDENT NEED- AND THEN

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:42.946
THE REMAINDER OF THOSE FUNDS

00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:45.181
ARE PROVIDED CAMPUSES BASED ON

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:46.983
A FORMULA WHERE EACH

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.818
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RECEIVES

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:51.087
THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING THIS

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.455
WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.958
EQUALITY BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES.

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:56.426
NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN USING THE

00:59:56.492 --> 01:00:03.066
SYSTEM FOR- MULTIPLE. HERE

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:03.666
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.233
REALIZE THAT THERE MAY SOME

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.002
ISSUES WITH HOW THE FUNDS ARE

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.403
TO. AND THE REGIONS ARE

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.506
EXAMINING THE FORMULA- WE ARE

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.675
THINKING ABOUT CHANGING IT TO

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.877
WHERE NO CAMPUS WHERE YOU'RE

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.513
RECEIVING- LESS THAN FIVE

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.816
PERCENT. OF IN THE UNWEIGHTED

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.752
STUDENT AMOUNT- FROM OTHER

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:26.089
CAMPUSES. AND THAT IS IT MUST

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.025
BE BETTER THAN WHAT AT THE 95%

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.393
SO YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.564
ISSUE. THE TWO AUTHORS- I

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.499
BELIEVE PROFESSORS AT UC MERCED

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:40.770
SOCIOLOGY IS ALSO. PUBLISHED A

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.805
RECENT BOOK CALLED BROKEN. THAT

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:45.541
EXAMINES THE FUNDING

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:47.643
SPECIFICALLY AT UC RIVERSIDE

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:51.014
AND UC MERCED SO A QUESTION AND

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.948
THEY THEY THEY COME TO SOME

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:55.485
VERY- I THINK STARTLING

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.755
PROVOCATIVE CONCLUSIONS SO IF

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:02.792
WE WERE TO SUBTRACT THE NUMBER

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.461
OF. OF LATINO AND AFRICAN

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:09.499
AMERICAN STUDENTS. IN UC FROM-

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:14.203
UC RIVERSIDE UC MERCED UC SANTA

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:18.107
BARBARA. AND UC SANTA CRUZ- WE

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.375
WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE A MUCH

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.379
LESS DIVERSE UC- THEN WE HAVE

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:25.848
AT PRESENT SO THE AUTHORS MAKE

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:29.285
THE POINT THAT YOU SEE IS ABLE

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:34.357
TO- YOU KNOW- EXPOUND ON ON THE

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:39.095
DIVERSITY OF THE UC- ENROLLMENT.

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.230
BUT THE AUTHORS POINT OUT THAT

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.065
THAT A LOT OF IT IS

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.700
CONCENTRATED AT UC RIVERSIDE

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:47.737
AND UC MERCED. WHICH HAPPENED

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:51.607
TO BE THE MOST UNDERFUNDED-

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:55.378
CAMPUSES OF THE UC SYSTEM- WE

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.480
TALK ABOUT OUT OF STATE AND

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.382
INTERNATIONAL STUDENT

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.784
ENROLLMENT AND I UNDERSTAND AS

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.687
ALL OF US DO HERE. HOW YOU SEE

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:06.923
HAS A RELIED ON THAT AS

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:10.560
ESPECIALLY DURING. THE TIME OF

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:11.160
LESS FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.563
CALIFORNIA. BUT AS WE LOOK TO

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:17.733
SEE HOW WE CAN BETTER- B. MORE

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.702
EQUAL IN THE TREATMENT OF ALL

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.505
THE CAMPUSES. I DON'T MIGHT

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:24.073
PROPOSE THE IDEA THAT HAS BEEN

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.509
SUGGESTED BEFORE THAT THE

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.778
INCOME THE REVENUE THAT IS

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.380
PRODUCED BY INTERNATIONAL

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:35.218
STUDENTS- AND- OUT OF STATE

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.753
STUDENTS BE DIVIDED. AMONG ALL

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.956
THE CAMPUSES BECAUSE CERTAINLY

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.524
NOT ALL THE CAMPUSES HAVE THE

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:46.696
SAME- RESOURCES TO ATTRACT. HOW

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:47.563
TO STATE AND INTERNATIONAL

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:51.968
STUDENTS- SO I DO THINK THAT-

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.703
THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.905
AUTHORS COME OUT WITH IN THEIR

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.107
BOOK I IN THEIR OP ED PIECE IS

01:02:58.174 --> 01:03:00.009
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:02.011
SEE NEEDS TO LOOK AT MORE MORE

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:04.580
CAREFULLY. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:08.184
POINT IS THAT- THE FORMULAS

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:08.784
THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR SO

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.554
LONG. WORKED TO THE DETRIMENT

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.257
OF THOSE MOST DIVERSE CAMPUSES

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.459
AND WORK FOR THE DETRIMENT TO

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.160
THE AREAS OF THE STATE OF

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.829
CALIFORNIA THAT UNFORTUNATELY

01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:21.464
ARE MORE IN THE HAVE NOTS THAN

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:26.335
THE HOUSE SO SOMETHING TO LOOK.

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:26.869
AT MORE CLOSELY AS WE MOVE

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:30.840
FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:34.977
MR GALLAGHER. IT WHAT DO YOU

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.179
WANT TO PAY FOR THE RESPONSE

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:40.349
FROM THAT- JUST ESTá OUT IF-

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:40.883
IF WE COULD MAYBE HAVE A

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:43.419
RESPONSE TO. THE IDEA OF

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.955
SHARING REVENUE. OF FOR

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.990
INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:54.530
STUDENTS YEAH. CURRENTLY

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.065
INTERNATIONAL AN OUT OF STATE

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:58.201
STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.802
FOR THE FULL COST OF THEIR OWN

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:02.205
EDUCATION WHICH MEANS A LOT OF

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.907
THEIR FEES GO TO THE CAMPUS

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.376
WHERE THEY ARE SO THAT THE FULL

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:08.544
COST OF THEIR EDUCATION CAN BE

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.379
COVERED. EACH INTERNATIONAL

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:14.817
STUDENT DOES HOWEVER- HEY MORE

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.352
THAN WHAT IT COSTS TO EDUCATE

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.221
THEM SO THERE IS FUNDING LEFT

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.723
OVER FROM THE CAMPUS OF WHERE

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:23.025
THEY ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING.

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.660
THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING USED BY

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:26.429
THOSE CAMPUSES TO PAY FOR THEIR

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.331
FACULTY AND OTHER STUDENTS

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.866
SERVICES OR OPERATIONS ON BOTH

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:33.536
CAMPUSES SO IF THERE WAS ANY

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:35.638
MOVEMENT OFFUNDING AWAY WE

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.840
HAVE TO BE VERY COGNISANT. OF

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:40.209
SUDDEN DRASTIC REDUCTIONS TO

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:42.144
OUR CAMPUS BUDGET. THIS IS AN

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.413
IDEA THAT- I THINK WE SHOULD

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:51.287
TALK MUCH MORE. ABOUT- ONE ONE.

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:54.190
OF COURSE WOULD BE- IF JUST THE

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:55.891
TOTAL NUMBER OF NON RESIDENTS

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.660
WITH INCREASED SYSTEM WIDE. OR

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.295
REVENUE DISTRIBUTION BUT I

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.696
DON'T THINK YOU'RE A FAVOR OF

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:03.666
THAT IDEA BUT WE CAN HAVE A

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:04.267
FURTHER CONVERSATION THANK YOU

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.937
SIR. I YEAH I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:09.538
IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHAT WHAT MR

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:11.073
MEDINA SAID ABOUT THE DIVERSE

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.675
CITY NUMBERS WITH THE TWO

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.710
THINGS ONE. THE LATINO HIGH

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.178
SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE HAS

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.146
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:18.814
LAST TEN TWENTY YEARS THE

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:21.684
NUMBER OF LATINO GRADUATES WHO.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.085
ARE A THREE G. READY AND YOU

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.588
SEE ELIGIBLE SO YOU SEE

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:26.589
OBVIOUSLY IS TAKE NOTE OF THAT

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.424
AND PATTING OURSELVES ON THE

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.760
BACK FOR THAT. OKAY BUT I THINK

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.628
MR MEDINA'S POINT IS WELL TAKEN

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.897
IF YOU LOOK AT. THE THAT NINE

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:36.699
UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES YOU KNOW

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.000
IF YOU REALLY THAT THAT THREE

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.535
OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER WITH

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:44.674
UCLA. BERKELEY AND- SAN DIEGO.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.242
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THE

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.344
DIVERSEY NUMBERS FOR THOSE.

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.245
THOSE ARE STILL VERY

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.180
DISCOURAGING FOR US AS AS AS

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.249
GOOD AS DATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.383
I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.886
AFTER SO KEEP THAT IN MIND- MR

01:05:56.952 --> 01:06:00.589
GALLAGHER. YES THANK YOU MISTER

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:03.426
CHAIRMAN- SO. YOU'RE RUNNING

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.728
SOME OF THE NUMBERS. YOU SEE

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.663
ENROLLMENT GREW BY SEVEN POINT

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:10.633
6% FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.335
TWENTY NINETEEN. HOWEVER WITHIN

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:15.204
THIS GROWTH NONRESIDENT ROAMING

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.207
GREW BY 17% WELL RESIDENT

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:20.209
ENROLLMENT GREW BY FIVE POINT

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:24.714
7% THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS AS A

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.582
RESULT OF THE CORONA VIRUS

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.284
PANDEMIC NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:33.055
DECLINED. FROM TWENTY NINETEEN

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:33.689
TO TWENTY TWENTY BY THREE POINT

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:36.258
7% WELL RESIDENT ENROLLMENT

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:40.730
GREW SLIGHTLY BY ABOUT 1% SO MY

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.565
QUESTION TO YOU SEE IS DOES

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.300
THIS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:47.002
NOW. FOR YOU SEE TO RE BALANCE

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.138
THE RATIOS OF NON RESIDENT AND

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.240
RESIDENT ENROLLMENT ESPECIALLY

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.442
AT CAMPUSES LIKE BERKELEY AND

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.845
UCLA WITH THE HISTORY OF MORE

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:58.647
THAN 18% NONRESIDENT.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:05.187
ENROLLMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.790
QUESTION SIR- WE DON'T THINK

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.492
THAT THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.293
TO REBALANCE OUR NONRESIDENT

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.095
ENROLLMENT BECAUSE THE STUDENTS

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:15.464
DO YOU ONLY A LOT OF MONEY TO

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.032
ALL THE CAMPUSES WHERE THEY

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:21.137
ATTEND- AND IF WE REMOVE THOSE

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:23.172
FUNDS FROM THE CAMPUS BUDGETS.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.741
THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE CUTS TO

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:29.779
EXISTING SERVICES. THANK YOU.

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.647
OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK LIKE

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.782
YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.683
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT'S AN

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:38.988
ACCEPTABLE ANSWER- YOU KNOW FOR

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:40.256
ALL THE REASONS STATED BEFORE

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.091
BUT MOST ESPECIALLY YOU ARE A

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:43.793
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:47.596
SYSTEM AND WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.131
WANTED OUT OF YOU THE

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:50.866
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE WANT IS

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:54.703
TO SEE THAT THOSE RATIOS. NINE

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.971
GET TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.773
WHICH IS THE SHOULD BE- SYSTEM

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.476
THAT SERVES. FOR CALIFORNIA

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.278
RESIDENTS SO I MEAN I THINK YOU

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.479
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GOING

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:05.714
FROM THERE BUT I THINK FOR US.

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:06.715
WE'RE HEARING VERY CLEARLY FROM

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.350
YOU SEE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:11.987
PLANS- SO I THINK THAT SHOULD

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.622
GO INTO OUR PLANNING AS- HOW WE

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.791
WANT TO HELP. HOLD THEM

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:16.325
ACCOUNTABLE IN THIS BUDGET

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:23.766
PROCESS- ON THE ISSUE OF.

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.301
ANOTHER VERY FRUSTRATING THING

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.937
FOR ME I WENT TO UC BERKELEY I

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:28.637
WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.372
TO GO THERE BUT YOU KNOW I

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.175
WORKED REALLY HARD. YEAH YOU

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.744
KNOW IN HIGH SCHOOL AND- NO DID

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.279
THE WORK OUT A LOT OF SUPPORT

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:38.981
FROM MY COMMUNITY AND WAS

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.616
FORTUNATE TO GET IN THERE I'LL

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:42.117
TELL YOU WHAT I NEVER HAD

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:44.153
ANYBODY WRITING A LETTER FROM

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.222
ME. THERE WAS NO TRUSTEE.

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:47.156
WRITING A LETTER FOR ME TO GET

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:50.693
ME INTO- UC BERKELEY- SO IT'S

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.395
VERY. FRUSTRATING TO HEAR OF

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.865
EVEN AFTER THE SCANDAL. YOU

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.266

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.088
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.256

ADMISSIONS AND IT'S GOOD CUT

01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:03.906
THAT COUPLES WITH THE FACT THAT

WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:08.010

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.462
TO ME ESPECIALLY AS WE PULL

NOT BE THE BEST PRACTICE SO I

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.694
HOPE I HOPE THE UC IS THINKING

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.863
ABOUT I HAVE A KIND OF A SIMPLE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.931

TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS IN THERE.

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:14.983

THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS SO WE'RE

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.954
NOT CALLING OUT OF SPECIFIC

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.056
WHAT'S DEFINED THANK YOU EQUITY

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:50.191
TAX HERE AND THE REASON IS

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.393
BECAUSE I WAS AS THE L. A. O.

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.695
NOTES- AND AS WE WORK WITH OUR

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.397
OUR PARTNERS OVER THE YEARS

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:57.432
THEY THEY EACH OF THE SEGMENTS

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:59.434
HAS EXISTING EQUITY GOALS. BUT

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.103
WE DON'T WANT TO SPECIFIED UP

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:02.771
FRONT BEFORE THEY CAN GET

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:05.907
TOGETHER- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE. A

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.009
DATE FOR SETTING THESE GOALS A

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.378
YEAR OUT FROM NOW SO THAT THEY

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.880
THE SEGMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.214
TO ALIGN THE DEFINITIONS AND

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:16.117
METRICS. SO THAT WE'RE ALL

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:17.852
MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:21.389
AND MOVING ON THE SAME TIMELINE

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.357
SO THAT'S OUR PERSPECTIVE- I'LL

01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:27.462
PASS IT OFF TO SAY HERE. THANK

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:30.098
YOU IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSITY

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:32.934
WE- DO HAVE A PLAN FOR CLOSING

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.969
EQUITY GAPS- THAT'S OUR

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.538
FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY GOALS

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.573
THAT COST SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.140
IN THE FIRST YEAR OF

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:42.177
IMPLEMENTATION- THE WAY WE ARE

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.879
DEFINING AN EQUITY GAP. IS THE

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:46.948
TIME IT TAKES A STUDENT TO

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.683
GRADUATE SO WHAT WE ARE FINDING

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.218
IS THOSE STUDENTS ARE PELL

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:51.986
ELIGIBLE TAKE LONGER TO

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:54.155
GRADUATING STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT

01:24:54.222 --> 01:24:57.025
FOR EXAMPLE- AND BY CLOSING

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:59.093
EQUITY GAPS WE WOULD. TAKE

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.296
ACTIONS LIKE ADDITIONAL ONE BY

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:04.999
USING- HIRING FACULTY TO TEACH

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:07.802
BOTTLENECK COURSES AND SO FORTH

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:10.171
IT GETS TUDENTS THROUGH FASTER

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:13.875
SO THAT THEY'RE GRADUATING. AT

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:14.909
THE SAME RATE THAT'S OUR GOAL.

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.846
THANK YOU AND MY NEXT QUESTION

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:19.681
HERE IS RATHER THAN CREATING A

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.450
NEW DUAL IMMERSION PATHWAY.

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.818
WHICH WOULD ONLY STIR FIRST

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:25.253
TIME FRESHMAN APPLICANTS ARE

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.754
THERE OTHER WAYS TO STREAMLINE

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.656
OR EXPAND EXISTING TRANSFER

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.692
PATHWAYS BETWEEN UC AND

01:25:30.758 --> 01:25:32.994
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ENSURE

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:33.828
THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.563
OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND. ONE OF

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.166
THEIR UC'S A PREFERRED UC'S

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:40.101
UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.870
CLEARLY IDENTIFY TRANSFER

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:43.972
COURSES OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:46.074
COLLEGE AND WHY WOULDN'T WE BE

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.078
ALSO- ADDING THIS TO THE EQUITY

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:55.483
GOALS PLAN. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:58.419
QUESTION- ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:01.756
WE CAN INCREASE TRANSFERS BASED

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.625
ON THE EXISTING SYSTEMS AS OUR

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.727
NEW TRANSFER PATHWAYS PLUS

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.862
PROGRAM. WHERE THE STUDENT IS

01:26:07.929 --> 01:26:09.364
GUARANTEED ADMISSION TO

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:11.533
SPECIFIC CAMPUS BUT ALSO

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.934
THROUGH COMPLETING THE TRANSFER

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:17.672
PATHWAYS AND- ANY. UC CAMPUS SO

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:19.607
LET'S SAY THEY WANT TO GO TO UC

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:22.277
IRVINE- AND COMPLETE THE

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:25.113
TRANSFER PATHWAY BUT THEN

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.180
DECIDED THAT THEY WOULD

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.982
ACTUALLY RATHER GO TO UC SANTA

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:31.352
BARBARA- THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.687
FOR BOTH CAMPUSES SO WE ARE

01:26:32.754 --> 01:26:34.055
TRYING TO ELIMINATE THOSE

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.190
BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS. OUR

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:37.892
FACULTY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:39.093
ON THIS AND THAT THIS DEBATE TO

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.865
COMPLETE THE WORK BY TWENTY

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:44.566
TWENTY TO- I DO WANT TO NOTE

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:45.934
THAT WHEN WE GUARANTEED

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.201
ADMISSION FOR A GROUP OF

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.671
STUDENTS. IF WE DON'T INCREASE

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.806
THE NUMBER OF SEATS AVAILABLE

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.741
IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WHAT WE

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.076
ARE DOING IS PUSHING SOME

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.945
STUDENTS AWAY WHILE OTHERS ARE

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:59.047
GUARANTEED ADMISSION. SO THAT

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.349
WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:06.955
TO LOOK AT. THANK YOU. THANK

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:09.457

INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS- IT YOUR

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.468
NOTED THAT INTERNATIONAL

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:23.404
STUDENTS PAY MORE THAN THE COST

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:27.008
TO EDUCATE THEM. AND AT I AM A

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.044
LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THAT THAT

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:33.281
WOULD BE SUCH AN IMPORTANT.

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:36.484
STATEMENT TO MAKE- THAT THE

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:39.020
STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS FOR

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.221
THE EDUCATION OF SO MANY OF OUR

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.789
STUDENTS I THINK THAT THE STATE

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:44.892
OF CALIFORNIA DESERVES TO HAVE

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:45.660
GREATER DIFFERENCE WHEN IT

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:48.229

OUR CAMPUSES I THINK WITH THE

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:53.234
QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:56.771
COLLEAGUES REGARDING EQUITY I

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.107
AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED. OF THAT

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.109
THERE ISN'T A MORE DEFINITIVE

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:05.279
ANSWER ON WHAT WILL BE DONE TO

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:08.683
INCREASE EQUITY ESPECIALLY WITH

STUDENTS SO THE- I WILL ASK THE

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:24.766
QUESTION AGAIN I KNOW THAT IT'S

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:27.702
BEEN ASKED. SPECIFICALLY WHAT

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:31.706
WILL BE DONE TO INCREASE EQUITY

REGARDS TO. INCREASING STUDENT

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.059
EQUITY WE ARE REQUESTING THIRTY

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:53.027
MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP CLOSE

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.762
GRADUATION GAPS WITH WHICH WE

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.131
WOULD- HIRE ADDITIONAL

01:28:57.198 --> 01:29:00.935
ADVISORS- WE FIND THAT STUDENTS

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.805
ARE FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:07.008
DO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.243
ROUTINE AND FREQUENT MEETINGS

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:11.612

MILLION DOLLAR CUT- IN THE

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.204
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND WE WERE

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.339
NOT ABLE TO INCREASE SERVICES

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:41.909
BECAUSE WE'RE BALANCING- OUR

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.845
FUNDING BUT WE WERE ABLE TO USE

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:45.813
THE SERVICE AND FEDERAL FUNDS

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.448

CURRENT YEAR. THOSE ARE ONE

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.551
TIME ACTION SO WE DO APPRECIATE

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.386
THE RESTORATION WHICH WILL

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.455
ALLOW US TO CONTINUE SERVICES

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:57.391
AT OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.594
TWENTY LEVELS FOR OUR STUDENTS-

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.696
IN ORDER EXPAND SERVICES

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:03.564
BECAUSE CAMPUSES ARE ALREADY

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:05.299
USING. ALL OF THESE FUNDS WE

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:07.702
HAVE VERY LITTLE IN RESERVES-

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:10.204
WE DO NEED. MORE FUNDING IN

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.173
ORDER TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.242
PROVIDE THE SERVICES WERE VERY

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:17.411
PEOPLE BERMAN INSTITUTION- MOST

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.147
OF OUR FUNDING GOES TO SALARIES

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:21.382
AND BENEFITS. AND SO IN ORDER

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:23.751
TO INCREASE- THE NUMBER OF

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:27.088
COURSES IN ORDER TO INCREASE-

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:28.790
NUMBER SERVICES BEING PROVIDED.

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:31.759
WE DO NEED TO HIRE PEOPLE IN

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:33.594
TERMS OF WHAT IS BEING

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.630
CURRENTLY FUNDED UNIVERSITY

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:38.199
DOES HAVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:39.834
THREE HUNDRED. CALIFORNIA

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.902
RESIDENTS FOR WHOM WE HAVEN'T

01:30:40.968 --> 01:30:43.571
RECEIVED ANY MARGINAL COST OF

INSTRUCTION BERMAN ADMITTED

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:49.544
SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO THAT-

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.512
GREATER NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.680
OUR SYSTEM FOR HOME HAD NO

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.415
FUNDING. MEANS THAT THERE'S

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.850
FEWER DOLLARS REALLY PER

01:30:55.917 --> 01:31:00.054
STUDENT. GOING AROUND THANK YOU.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.157
IF I'M MISTER. IF SEEMS TO ME

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:06.060
THAT THAT M. IT SEEMS TO ME

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.462
THAT THE ANSWER IS. THIS IS THE

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:09.764
MONEY WE HAVE IN THIS IS HOW

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:12.433
WE'RE CHOOSING TO SPEND IT AND

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.368
IT'S NOT ON INCREASING EQUITY.

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:16.170
I THINK THAT TO WEAR IT

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.271
WHENEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:21.809
EQUITY AND- WHATEVER WHATEVER

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:23.411
DECISION WE MAKE IT HAS TO BE

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:26.547
INTENTIONAL IF WE ARE INTENT ON

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.716
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF LATINO

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.184
THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.552
WHICH HAVE BEEN UNDER

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.855
REPRESENTED AT UC'S. THE

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.923
DECISION HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.225
AND EVEN WITH WHATEVER THE

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.026
LIMITED FUNDING IS WHATEVER THE

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:41.462
LIMITED BUDGET IS TO SAY THIS

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:44.031
IS A PRIORITY AND THIS IS HOW

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:46.534
WE WILL SPEND THE MONEY IF WHAT

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:48.502
WHAT WHAT YOU RECEIVE IF YOU'RE

01:31:48.569 --> 01:31:50.838
SAYING IT ISN'T ENOUGH WE

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:51.739
CANNOT TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:54.308
OF EQUITY. THEN WHAT WOULD GIVE

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:55.776
US THE CONFIDENCE TO BELIEVE

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.378
THAT IF WE GIVE ANOTHER THIRTY

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:59.547
MILLION THAT REGULAR SLEEP IT

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:01.883
WILL NOW BE A PRIORITY. I AM

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:04.485
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.320
I SHARE THE COMMENTS OF MY

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.155
COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE

MARGINAL COST- WELL THAT'S

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:43.891

SCROLLING MONEY AWAY THAT WE

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.538

SHARE ON TOP OF THE TUITION-

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.933
FOR WHAT. WHAT WE ESTIMATED

COST TO EDUCATE A STUDENT

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.570
RIGHT. AND COMING FROM A

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.439
STUDENT ADVOCATE REALM ONLY

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:12.706
FOUR YEARS AGO THE UC SYSTEM I

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:13.407
RARELY AGREE WITH THE

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:15.242
ADMINISTRATION BUT IS WOULD IT

01:35:15.309 --> 01:35:17.044

SAY THAN THAT. ETHNONYM COMING

IN DOES NOT TAKE A SEAT AWAY

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.952

BRINGS INTO OTHER STATES. THAT

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.524

RESIDENT INSTRUCTION CURRENTLY

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:43.704
AND THEN- WE THINK WOULD BE

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:46.674
COVERED NECESSARILY- EIGHT NON

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.176
RESIDENTS ARE PAYING ABOUT 15%

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.378

01:35:54.014 --> 01:35:55.616
RESIDENT POPULATION AS WELL

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:56.851
RIGHT AND WITH ACADEMIC

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.686
COUNSELING DOES THAT COME OUT

01:35:58.752 --> 01:35:59.653
OF THE TUITION AND FEES

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.722
STUDENTS PAY ACADEMIC HOUSING

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:02.189
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:07.128
PREVIOUSLY FOR HELPING. ME

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:09.063
COUNSELING CAN BE PAID FOR WITH

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:12.066
A MIX OF STATE GENERAL FUND AND

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:14.735
TUITION. BURKE SO I BRING UP I

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:15.903
HIGHLIGHT THAT FACT ONLY

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.738
BECAUSE COMING FROM THAT WORLD

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.340
I WAS IN ONLY A COUPLE YEARS

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:21.709
AGO IS THAT. SO I DEFINITELY

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.010
AGREE WE NEED TO BE STEPPING UP

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:23.978
AND PROVIDING MORE

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.546
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.881
IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY MAKING

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:28.115
SURE THEY'RE TRANSFERRING FROM

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.950
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL.

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:30.885
BUT I'M DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:34.355
GROWING NON NON STATE AND NON

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:37.057
RESIDENT. SAN ROMAN AS LONG AS

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:37.892
IT IS BALANCED IN THEIR

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:38.792
APPROACH AND MAKING SURE WE

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:40.027
HAVE ENOUGH SEATS FOR EVERYONE.

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.662
THE REAL PROBLEM THAT I'VE SEEN

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:42.897
ON CAMPUSES AS WE GROW TOO

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.865
QUICKLY AND THOSE WHERE LIMITED

01:36:44.932 --> 01:36:46.800
RESOURCES ON THE CAMPUSES. AND

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.836
SAYS AND TO THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:50.771
A- BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS ARE

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:53.007
GRADUATING. SEVERAL PERCENTAGE

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.775
POINTS MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.677
STUDENTS IS INDICATIVE OF A LOT

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:57.411
OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:59.213
ESPECIALLY AS TO HOW YOU NOTICE

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.481
BEFORE THEY YOU KNOW TO BEFORE

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:02.416
IS LACK OF ADVISING ELECT OUR

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:04.251
LACK OF ADVISING AND THE

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:04.885
INCREASE IN BOTTLENECK OF

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:06.387
COURSES. THE REAL PROBLEM I'VE

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:07.888
SEEN BEFORE AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.590
YOU FIX THAT IN THE FRANKLY THE

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:10.124
THREE YEARS I'VE HAD BEEN

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.926
THERE. BUT IT IS A PROBLEM OF

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.394
THEIR TOO MANY STUDENTS TRYING

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.296
TO GET IN THE SAME CLASSES TOO

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:16.263
MANY STUDENTS TRYING TO ACCESS

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.998
THE SAME THE SAME RESOURCES AND

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:19.533
YET THE UC HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.135
FUND THOSE RESOURCES ADEQUATELY

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.269
OUR FUNDERS CLASS OFFERINGS

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.772
ADEQUATELY. SO THAT YOU KNOW IF

01:37:24.838 --> 01:37:26.974
YOU MISS ONE CRITICAL REQUIRED

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.243
CLASS YOU COULD BE SET BACK ONE

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.278
YEAR REPORT PLUS AND THAT DELAY

01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:33.380
THE GRADUATION RATE AND OFTEN.

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.548
AND I HAD MANY FIGHTS WITH MY

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:35.683
LOCAL MEASURES ABOUT HOW THE

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:38.485
EVEN PRIORITIZE HOW YOU SELECT

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:39.386
CLASSES WHERE YOU ARE ON THE

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:40.754
WAIT LIST THAT REALLY SCREWS

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:42.323
YOU OVER. BECAUSE IF YOU MISS

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:44.158
ONE CLASS YOU COULD BE SET BACK

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:45.926
TWO YEARS PAYING YOU KNOW

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:47.494
SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE-

01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:54.702
EVEN JUST THE REPORT COSTS- SO.

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:55.769
WELL I JUST. AT THE COVER.

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:56.770
ABOUT EQUITY IN ADDING TO ABOUT

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.539
THE ROLE PIECES BECAUSE- I. I'M

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.040
NOT OPPOSED TO HAVING MORE OUT

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.609
OF STATE STUDENTS AS LONG AS IT

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:02.610
IS OFF OF COURSE ACT WILL

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:04.111
BALLOTS WITH OUR- ON OUR

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:06.280
COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIANS- I

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:07.982
THINK FRANKLY HAVING MORE SINCE

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:08.616
FROM AROUND THE WORLD IS.

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:10.684
CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:11.619
EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND YOU

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.087
SEE I KNOW WAS TO MINE. AND

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.088
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:15.756
BALANCE THAT. IT'S NOT GREAT

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:16.724
THAT AND I KNOW A LOT OF

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.158
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:18.792
DEFINITELY FEEL AS THOUGH THEY

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.394
ARE THE CASH COWS OF. OF YOU

01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:21.762
SEE THE UPDATE VERY MUCH KNOW

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:22.997
THAT THEY ARE PAYING THREE

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:23.931
TIMES AS MUCH BUT IT'S ALSO

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:25.899
SELECTED FOR THE KINDS OF

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:26.533
INTERNATIONAL SINCE WE CAN HAVE

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.936
AS WELL- ONE OF COURSE. WE ARE

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:29.937
EVERYTHING CALIFORNIA'S NOT

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:31.472
DRAFT SINCE TOLD TOTALLY I

01:38:31.538 --> 01:38:33.274
THINK IT'S PARTY EQUATION- BUT

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.742
DEFINITELY. WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:36.110
THAT THE UC IS COMMITTED TO

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:37.111
THESE THINGS AND LOOKING AT IT

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:38.445
VERY CLOSELY. SO IF YOU ARE

HERE IN FRONT OF ME. I WILL SAY

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.931
THAT BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:54.368
TWENTY TWENTY. YOU SEE A ROLE-

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:56.370
ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:57.971
UNDERGRADUATES THAT WE RECEIVED

01:42:58.038 --> 01:42:59.373
MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:01.008
FUNDING FOR. FROM THE

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:03.577
LEGISLATURE SO WE DO TRY TO

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:04.978
MAKE YOUR WISHES AND KEEP UP

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.680
WITH THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN

01:43:06.747 --> 01:43:08.081
BLACK MATTER THIS IS A JUST OUT

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:09.683
OF CURIOSITY BUT- BOTH RURAL

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:10.918
DIRECTLY PAID FOR OUT OF THE

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.319
STATE BUDGET IN THROUGH

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:12.786
NEGOTIATION WITH THE

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.655
LEGISLATURE. I'LL WHY DIDN'T

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:17.157
THE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED INCREASE

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:20.160
IN NONRESIDENT STUDENT- ALSO

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:24.498
INCREASE COMMENSURATELY. AN

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:24.998
INCREASE IN NONRESIDENT

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:25.599
ENROLLMENT. SO FROM THE MONEY

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:30.938
WE- ADDED TO THE BUDGET. WE

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:34.308
INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FROM- NON

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:36.176
RESIDENTS THAT WE GET TO HELP

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:37.644
PAY FOR SERVICES FOR ALL

01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:40.781
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS SO IT'S

01:43:40.847 --> 01:43:43.483
INCREASING- VARIOUS TYPES OF

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.118
SERVICES AND INCREASING COURSES

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:47.854
FOR ALL STUDENTS- IS HOW THOSE

01:43:47.921 --> 01:43:49.690
FUNDS ARE USED IF WE RECEIVE

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:51.325
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR NON

01:43:51.391 --> 01:43:52.960
RESIDENTS DON'T USE THAT MUCH.

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:55.662
BUT AT WELL OTHER NON RESIDENTS

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:56.930
COUNCILLORS TO THERE'S NO

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.799
THERE'S NO LINK BETWEEN

01:43:58.865 --> 01:44:03.370
NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT IN IN.

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.004
STATE ENROLLMENT FOR CALIFORNIA

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:08.942
RESIDENTS. IS THERE. THE LINK

01:44:09.009 --> 01:44:11.545
IS THAT- WE GET WE ARE ABLE TO

01:44:11.612 --> 01:44:13.814
PAY FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES ON

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.248
ALL OUR ALL OUR CAMPUSES

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:18.018
CURRENTLY ABOUT 15% OF NUMBERS

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.920
BUDGETS THE SYSTEM WIDE COME

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:22.556
FROM NON RESIDENT TUITION

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:25.092
THAT'S JUST THE EXTRA PAYMENT

01:44:25.158 --> 01:44:27.260
THAT NONRESIDENT STUDENTS MAKE-

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.029
BECAUSE WE SPEND THAT ON ALL

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:31.732
KINDS OF SERVICES ON THE CAMPUS

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.133
ALL STUDENTS END UP BENEFITING

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.735
FROM WORK RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.870
AGREE WITH THAT SO SILVA SO THE

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:38.405
BENEFIT COULD BE TO THE

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:40.440
STUDENTS QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:43.610
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:51.685
INCREASED ACCESS. WE DON'T-

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:56.323
ADMIT NEW RESIDENTS STUDENTS-

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.625
WHEN WE ARE ADMITTING NON

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:00.260
RESIDENTS THE WE DO STATE OF

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.262
THE STATE OF THE CAP LEVELS BUT

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:05.265
WE DON'T- WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:08.101
LANDED TWO ONE ROMANS TO GATHER

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:10.003
IF THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:11.004
BUSINESS ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:13.040
LEVELS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:14.875
THAT THEY THEY WANT TO HAVE AND

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:18.245
THEN- WE HAVE THE ADMISSIONS

01:45:18.311 --> 01:45:19.513
DECISIONS FOR THE TWO

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:21.148
SEPARATELY SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE

01:45:21.214 --> 01:45:23.016
ADMIT OUR RESIDENTS. AND THEN

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:25.352
GO ON RESIDENTS TO CORRESPOND

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:26.486
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.088

VERY CLEAR FROM THE NUMBERS

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:31.892
OKAY CAN YOU TELL US WHY IN

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:34.428
FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN- YOU

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:36.763
SEE EXCEEDED THE 18% GOAL WITH

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:41.702
THE TWENTY ONE PERCENT- IN

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.537
ROMAN OF NONRESIDENTS. WE HAVE

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:44.471
A HEARING LOSS YEAR SO THAT'S

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.840
WHEN WE CAN GET THAT BECAUSE-

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:48.175
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

STARK- ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ARE

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.146
VERY DIFFICULT AND THAT. WE

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.848
DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THE

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.516
YIELD WILL BE STUDENTS ARE

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.885
PROVIDED WITH OFFERS. AND WE

01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:02.189
MAKE- PREDICTIONS ABOUT HOW

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:03.890
MANY WILL ACCEPT THOSE OFFERS.

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:07.027
BASED ON PRIOR YEAR AVERAGES.

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:09.329
AND THEN SOME YEARS CAMPUSES DO

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:12.799
OVERSHOOTS SLIGHTLY. IN TWENTY

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:13.400

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.848
SYSTEM WIDE FOR STUDENT BASIC

01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:31.318
NEEDS. OR OUR LOW INCOME

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:36.089
STUDENTS. OKAY BUT LET'S LET'S

01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.991
JUST TALK ABOUT WITH 3% OF THAT

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.260
NUMBER IS IT'S ALMOST SIXTY

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:43.029
SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. SO

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.831
THAT'S NOT. WELL I'M JUST

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.633
TAKING 3% YOU YOU GIVE ME OF

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:49.402
KIND OF YOUR EYES POPPED. 3% OF

01:46:49.469 --> 01:46:51.438
THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:52.305
THOUSAND THE JUNE ROLLED IF WE

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:54.908
RE DID THE RATIO. THAT RESULTS

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:58.612
IN THE FIRST 3% MULTIPLIED BY

01:46:58.678 --> 01:46:59.813
TWO TWENTY SIX OF SIXTY SEVEN

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.917
EIGHTY THREE. RIGHT SIR I THINK

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:07.487
THE OVER AND ROLAND WAS CLOSER

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:08.855
TO TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS OVERALL

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:11.391
SYSTEM WIDE. I I WILL GET THOSE

01:47:11.458 --> 01:47:13.126
NUMBERS FOR YOUR OFFICE OKAY

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:14.728
ARE YOU. DISCUSSING WITH ABOUT

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:16.563
THE NUMBER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:22.869
21% VERSUS 18% RIGHT. YOU'RE

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.905
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE THEY'RE

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.606
ENTIRE CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:28.542
ALLOWED IS YEAH THERE ARE SOME

01:47:28.608 --> 01:47:30.343
CAMPUSES BECAUSE THEY ARE THEIR

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:33.647
CAP IS HIGHER THAN 18% YES THEY

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:36.316
DO. IN ROLL UP MORE NON

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:40.120
RESIDENT STUDENTS AND CAMPUSES

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:40.687
THAT HAVE A CAP OF EIGHTEEN.

01:47:40.754 --> 01:47:41.855
RIGHT RIGHT NO I UNDERSTAND BUT

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:42.956
THE WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THE

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:46.126
OVERALL THE OVERALL UNIVERSITY

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:51.498
CAMPUS SUPPOSED TO BE 18% WHEN

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:53.099
THE REGION'S ADOPTED THE GAP

01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:55.335
THEY ALLOW CAMPUSES THAT WERE

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:58.138
ALREADY ABOVE THE 18% LEVEL TO.

01:47:58.205 --> 01:48:00.373
CONTINUE TO ENROLL THE NUMBER

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.808
OF NON RESIDENTS THAT THEY WERE

01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:03.076
ROLLING WHEN THE COP WAS

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.011
ADOPTED AND THAT'S WHY THERE

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:07.981
ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT ARE

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:09.349
ABOVE THAT EIGHT. THAT WAS THE

01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:10.784
AGREEMENT WE WITH- UNIVERSITY

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:13.420
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OVERALL

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:16.089
NOT TO EXCEED 18% IT WASN'T SO

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:18.225
THAT. THREE THE THREE THAT WERE

01:48:18.291 --> 01:48:19.993
HIGHER BERKELEY UCLA SAN DIEGO

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.194
WHICH WERE ABOUT EIGHTEEN

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:22.462
PERCENT. WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:25.999
HARD THAT IS CORRECT BUT THE

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.334
18% WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.336
OVERALL TARGET FOR THE ENTIRE

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:32.005
SYSTEM. KNOWING THAT SOME

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.940
CAMPUSES LIKE MERCED. ASIDE

01:48:34.007 --> 01:48:36.743
WOULD NOT WOULD NOT REALLY GET

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:37.377
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT EIGHTEEN

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:40.947
PERCENT- AND SO SEEING A 21%

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:43.850
NUMBER IN THE FALL OF TWENTY

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:46.286
NINETEEN. CAN WE CAN WE

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.521
UNDERSTAND WHAT CORRECTIVE

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:49.022
ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:55.729
UNIVERSITY. THE UNIVERSITY HAS

01:48:55.795 --> 01:49:00.267
CAP

01:49:00.333 --> 01:49:02.569
CURRENTLY ARE ABOUT 80% YEAH I

01:49:02.636 --> 01:49:08.875
THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT- THEN-

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.578
TARGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:49:11.645 --> 01:49:14.514
WAS A NON RESIDENT- TARGET FOR

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.115
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WHAT'S

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:16.049
WHAT ARE YOUR WHAT ARE YOUR

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:17.150
MOMENT TARGETS FOR RESIDENTS

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:23.390
NON RESIDENTS IN TOTALS FOR.

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:23.990
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE PLAN THE

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:28.695
WHOLE- ENROLLMENT FLAT. OR

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:30.730
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ACADEMIC

01:49:30.797 --> 01:49:32.165
YEAR. WHICH MEANS WE WOULD AND

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:34.000
MAKE ROUGHLY THE SAME- NUMBER

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:36.569
AND RATIO STUDENTS AS WE DID

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.104
FOR FALL ONE TWENTY. GUNS TO

01:49:38.171 --> 01:49:39.539
SEE YOU SEE YOU YOU ANTICIPATED

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:43.109
ROLLING ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:43.677
TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:44.678
AGAIN ROUGHLY. AND OBVIOUSLY WE

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:48.949
KNOW IT'S NOT A PERFECT SCIENCE.

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.216
YES AN UNDERGRADUATE YES

01:49:50.283 --> 01:49:55.522
CORRECT. RIGHT SO OFTEN. WHAT

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:57.824
DO WE NEED TO DO AND BURKE

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:01.394
CAMPUSES ADDICTION TO NON

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:08.134
RESIDENT STUDENTS. SIR IF WE

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:09.569
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NON

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:11.838
RESIDENTS WILL LOSE FUNDING FOR

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:16.309
THOSE CAMPUSES AND SO- WE WOULD

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.345
PREFER NOT TO HAVE TRUSTED

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:22.449
BUDGET CUTS TO OUR CAMPUSES-

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:25.919
WE- IF WE HAD. CUTS FOR

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.554
MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.689
CANVASES WOULD HAVE TO CUT

01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:30.957
STUDENT SERVICES THEY WOULD

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:32.092
HAVE TO CUT THE NUMBER OF

01:50:32.158 --> 01:50:33.927
COURSES AVAILABLE AND IT WOULD

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:35.662
MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR ALL

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:40.433
STUDENTS- WE DID SUBMIT A PLAN

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.168
TO YOU ARE YOU YEARS AGO I

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:44.371
BELIEVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OR

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.639
REDUCING NON RESIDENTS- AND AT

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:49.042
THAT TIME FOUND THAT IT COULD

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:51.144
BE TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE-

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.013
DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:55.782
REDUCTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:50:55.849 --> 01:50:59.319
YEAH BETWEEN HUNDREDS OF

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:01.454
MILLIONS TO BILLIONS. RIGHT BUT

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:03.456
THAT THAT WAS IF YOU IF YOU

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:04.090
TOOK IT DOWN ALL THE WAY I

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:06.659
THINK TO. FIVE OR 10% BUT

01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:08.161
NOTHING THING GRADUALLY OVER

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:10.663
TIME. I'M I THINK I THINK THE

01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:14.567
CHALLENGE IS YOU NOW HAVE- NINE

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.536
CHANCELLORS OR I GUESS I WOULD

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:20.106
SAY SEVEN CHANCELLORS. WHO-

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:23.443
THIS IS THE ONLY AMOUNT OF

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:24.911
MONEY THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETE

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:28.148
DISCRETION OVER. SO THEY HAVE

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:30.650
EVERY INCENTIVE TO FOCUS AND

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:32.218
BRING IN NON RESIDENT ROMAN

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:32.852
BECAUSE IT'S THEIR ONLY

01:51:32.919 --> 01:51:34.287
DISCRETIONARY POT OF MONEY I

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:35.522
MEAN YOU YOU MENTIONED YOU WERE

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:37.590
OUT YOU WERE AT A CAMPUS BUDGET

01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:38.191
OFFICE WHICH CAMPUS WHERE YOU

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:42.629
WERE. I WAS AT UC DAVIS AND

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:43.496
THEN IF YOU SEE BERKELEY

01:51:43.563 --> 01:51:45.799
WONDERFUL SO WHAT WOULD YOU

01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:46.833
WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS IS

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.835
PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY POTS

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:49.736
OF MONEY THAT DAVIS OR

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:51.538
BERKELEY. HAD THAT WAS

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:52.972
COMPLETELY UP TO THE

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:55.175
CHANCELLOR'S DISCRETION-

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:57.077
THERE'S A STATE MONIES

01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:58.978
APPROPRIATE BY FORMULA THE TO

01:51:59.045 --> 01:52:01.481
THE FEE MONEY IS THE FEMALE

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:03.349
NAME. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:05.785
WAYS THAT THEY COULD GET

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:07.053
ADDITIONAL REVENUE ON CAMPUS.

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.324
IN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. I

01:52:11.391 --> 01:52:12.992
WOULD SAY THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:15.328
CERTAIN THESE BONDS ARE WHAT WE

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:18.832
USED TO CALL FUNGIBLE THAT IS-

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:20.500
THE CAMPUS GOING TO SUSPEND

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:21.634
THEM ON ANY COURT CAMPUS

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.370
ACTIVITY. SO THE CHANCELLOR

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:26.639
HAVE. NO INCENTIVE EFFECTIVE

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:30.510
HUGE DISINCENTIVE TO REDUCE

01:52:30.577 --> 01:52:37.851
NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. THE

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:40.286
CHANCELLOR'S WANT TO MAINTAIN

01:52:40.353 --> 01:52:42.489
FISCAL HEALTH OF THEIR CAMPUSES

01:52:42.555 --> 01:52:45.725
AND- WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:48.294
INCREASE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES-

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.630
I THINK THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:52.365
THE ONES THAT THEY HAVE YES SO

01:52:52.432 --> 01:52:55.435
THIS IN IN THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:52:55.502 --> 01:52:56.069
ONLY FUNDING SOURCES THEY COULD

01:52:56.136 --> 01:53:00.807
GOING CHRIS. SOME OF OUR

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:04.244
CAMPUSES ARE THE 18% CAP SO-

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.278
THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:53:05.345 --> 01:53:06.946
INCREASES FUNDING SOURCE

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:10.483
TREMENDOUSLY BUT- YES THIS IS

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:11.618
ONE OF THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:14.420
CAMPUSES SOURCE AVAILABLE FOR

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:17.590
INCREASED- BETWEEN SAY TWENTY

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:21.294
TEN. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:21.861
SEVENTEEN YEAH SO SINCE THE

01:53:21.928 --> 01:53:24.731
CHURCHILL MCCARTY MENTIONED-

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:25.798
THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.066
WITH REVISITING THE BUDGET THIS

01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:29.869
YEAR NOT AN ABSOLUTE WILL BE-

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.539
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT OVER. THE

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:35.508
LONG RUN UC NEEDS TO REDUCE

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:38.244
THAT FIGURE DOWN TO TEN OR EVEN

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:40.780
BACK 25% IN TERMS OF. OUT OF

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:43.316
STATE ENROLLMENT. AND WE

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:45.151
BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE WAYS

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:48.087
THAT CAN BE DONE IS TO CONTINUE

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.656
TO EXPAND- THE DIFFERENT

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:52.358
CAMPUSES IN FIND DIFFERENT

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:55.028
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND. ON

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:56.196
ENROLLMENT AT THE DIFFERENT AT

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:57.463
THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND

01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:59.766
WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO.

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:01.134
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION I WANTED

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.368
TO GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:04.137
QUESTIONS FROM SAN BERNARD DINO

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:06.806
INTER RIVERSIDE FOR THINK IT'S

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.107
VERY IMPORTANT. THAT THE

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:09.275
UNIVERSITY'S ASKING FOR

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:10.376
ADDITIONAL SIXTY MILLION

01:54:10.443 --> 01:54:11.878
DOLLARS FOR ACTIVE CLOSE THE

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:14.914
EQUITY GAP- WHAT IS THE- YOU

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:17.250
KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE-

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:20.119
GRADUATION TARGETS. FOR AFRICAN

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:23.456
AMERICANS LATINOS THAT THIS.

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:25.725
THAT THAT IF WE YOU THE- SIXTY

01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:27.360
MILLION WHAT WOULD BE CALLED

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.128
THE- GRADUATION GAP FOR LATINO

01:54:29.195 --> 01:54:31.164
AFRICAN AMERICANS THAN TELEGRAM

01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:35.802
RECIPIENTS. WHAT'S THE GOLDEN.

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:39.105
AND OVER WHAT TIME- THANK YOU

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:42.175
SIR THE- GOAL WOULD BE TO FULLY

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:45.345
CLOSE THE GRADUATION BY TWENTY

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.813
THIRTY SO WOULD BE TO BRING THE

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:49.249
AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LAST NEXT-

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:51.584
REGULATION RATES THE SAME LEVEL

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:54.554
AS OF THE STUDENTS WHO

THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:21.127
REDUCTION IN NONRESIDENT

01:58:21.194 --> 01:58:23.796
ENROLLMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE-

01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:25.264
WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE AND

01:58:25.331 --> 01:58:27.033
THEN YOU I THINK YOU I WOULD

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:27.633
ADVISE YOU TO START THINKING

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.970
ABOUT- NUMBERS ABOUT HOW HOW

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.709
ASSIST YOU WITH THAT THE END

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:38.177
AGAIN THAT PERCENTAGE CAN GO

01:58:38.244 --> 01:58:39.846
DOWN IF YOU INCREASED THE

01:58:39.912 --> 01:58:41.380
CALIFORNIA STATE IN ROME

01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:42.148
DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN THAT YOU

01:58:42.215 --> 01:58:44.150
DECREASE NONRESIDENT ROMAN JUST

01:58:44.217 --> 01:58:45.351
MEET YOU COULD CONTINUE TO

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:47.487
INCREASE INSTEAD A ROLL. SO

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:48.855
THAT THAT THAT WILL DEFINITELY

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.389
BE PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS

01:58:50.456 --> 01:58:52.925

AGENDA BUT GO BACK TO MR MEDINA

01:58:58.664 --> 01:59:00.533
SAID DO YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.235
THERE I KNOW THE NOT THE MOST

01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:04.570
RECENT NUMBERS FOR NONRESIDENT

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:06.372
ENROLLMENT FOR THE NINE CAMPUS

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:09.575
WE KNOW THAT LA BERKELEY. AND

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:12.311
SAN DIEGO ARE BETWEEN TWENTY

01:59:12.378 --> 01:59:13.279
AND TWENTY FOUR AS YOU SAID

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:16.382
AND- THE IRVINE INSTANT DAVIS

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:17.917
THAT IS CAN GO UP TO EIGHTEEN

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.086
WHICH WAS OUR POLICY AND THAT

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:21.420
THE NUMBER THAT CAMPUS IS AT

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:24.857
THE BOTTOM AND- THEN RIVERSIDE.

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:29.028
MERCED. AND SANTA CRUZ WHAT

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:32.365
WERE THEIR NUMBERS. I DON'T

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:34.934
HAVE THE BY CAMPUS NON RESIDENT

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.836
INVOLVEMENT IN FRONT OF ME I DO

01:59:36.903 --> 01:59:38.838
BELIEVE IT'S WRONG FOR THE LAST

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:40.139
SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE

01:59:40.206 --> 01:59:41.974
EXCEPTION OF BALD WHEN PLANNING

01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:47.179
WITHOUT. YEAH MS. BUT BUT- I'M

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:48.447
A CONTRACTOR AND UNDERSTANDING

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:51.918
THAT IT'S MINIMAL THE NUMBER.

01:59:51.984 --> 01:59:53.719
OF OUT OF STATE AND

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:55.555
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS S. N. UC

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:57.757
RIVERSIDE I THINK FOR JOBS

01:59:57.823 --> 02:00:00.359
INTERNATIONAL. IS PRETTY

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:01.861
MINIMAL IN COMPARISON TO THE

02:00:01.928 --> 02:00:07.099
OTHER CAMPUSES. YES SIR I

02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:09.602
BELIEVE THAT- MERCED THERE ARE

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:12.071
ALMOST NO INTERNATIONAL

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:13.706
STUDENTS THERE'S VERY FEW

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:15.975
MERCED AND IT RIVERSIDE THE

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:18.544
NUMBER IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:24.650
OTHER CAMPUSES. YEAH YES SIR WE

02:00:24.717 --> 02:00:27.920
HAVE HERE- MR DENTAL AND OUR

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.522
GENDER FROM TWENTY NINETEEN

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:31.691
SINCE TWO YEARS AGO AND I THINK

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:33.426
IT'S THE SAME SOBRE OF BERKELEY

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:35.561
WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE UCLA WAS

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:38.130
TWENTY FOUR- SAN DIEGO WAS

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:40.833
TWENTY THREE- THAT THE THREE IN

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:42.702
THE MID MIDDLE THE POLICY WAS

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.403
THEY CAN GO 218% SO THAT WAS

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:47.940
IRVINE. AS AT NINETEEN DAVIS AT

02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:52.011
EIGHTEEN- AND IN SANTA BARBARA

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:52.578
AT SIXTEEN THAT THREE AT THE

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:54.780
BOTTOM. WE'RE AND WE'RE

02:00:54.847 --> 02:01:00.987
RIVERSIDE AT 4%MERCED IS AT 0%

02:01:01.053 --> 02:01:04.390
IN SANTA CRUZ AT 11% SO WELL

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:05.858
UNDER TEN AYE MAYBE THEY'VE GOT

02:01:05.925 --> 02:01:07.526
A LITTLE BIT BUT AND WELL UNDER

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:10.329
TEN AND VERY LOW JUST JUST TO

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:12.264
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S-

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:12.932
NECESSARY TO KEEP IT IN

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:15.001
PERSPECTIVE. THAT THAT THOSE

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:18.070
NUMBERS ARE. ARE MINIMAL AT

02:01:18.137 --> 02:01:22.041
THAT THE OTHER CAMPUSES. ON ON

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:25.578
THE POINT OF EQUITY IT IS ALSO-

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:26.979
THERE'S SOME IRONY THAT THE

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:29.949
CAMPUSES LIKE RIVERSIDE THAT

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:32.218
ARE UNDERFUNDED ARE DOING

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:34.654
BETTER WITH EQUITY- WHERE THE

02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:37.957
GRADUATION RATE FOR LATINO ARE

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:40.393
PROBABLY BETTER HIGHER. AT UC

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:41.227
RIVERSIDE EVEN THOUGH IT'S

02:01:41.293 --> 02:01:43.429
UNDER FUNDED THAN AT OTHER

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:48.601
CAMPUSES. OKAY THANK YOU SO

02:03:28.134 --> 02:03:28.501
NEXUS WITH THESE TWO

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.936
OBJECTIVES. JUST FOR EXAMPLE

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:32.304
STOOD MENTAL HEALTH IS

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:33.706
SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITY

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:35.307
IN RECENT YEARS HAS PROVIDED

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:36.909
FUNDING PORTAGE RAMPED UP

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.911
FUNDING FOR OVERTIME SO THIS IS

02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:39.411
EFFECTIVELY AN EXISTING

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:41.680
PROGRAM. BUT THEY UNIVERSITY

02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:43.149
THE STATE HAS NOT FUNDED A

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:45.217
SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT TECHNOLOGY-

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:46.485
INITIATIVE BEFORE SO THIS WOULD

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:49.121
BE A NEW ISSUE. SO IN THIS CASE

02:03:49.188 --> 02:03:50.289
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:51.557
WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:52.625
CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THIS

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:56.228
PROPOSAL AND POTENTIALLY TACKLE

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:58.330
EACH ISSUE SEPARATELY. ON THE

02:03:58.397 --> 02:03:59.431
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:02.501
TIME GENERAL FUND. I'M HERE THE

02:04:02.568 --> 02:04:04.170
ISSUE WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:05.371
HAS LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:04:05.437 --> 02:04:07.573
HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD INTERACT

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.308
WITH THE MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:11.177
FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING FOR

02:04:11.243 --> 02:04:12.812
STUDENT EMERGENCY AID ALL THE

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:14.246
SEGMENTS HAVE RECEIVED

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:16.048
EMERGENCY EMERGENCY FINANCE

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:17.516
FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY STUDENT AID

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:19.618
AND TWO SEPARATE ROUNDS. AND

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:20.352
ARE POTENTIALLY SLATED TO

02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:23.989
RECEIVE EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIAL

02:04:24.056 --> 02:04:24.590
AMOUNT OF FUNDING UNDER THIRD

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:26.625
ROUND. WE RECOMMEND YOU

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:27.993
EVALUATE THE PROPOSED A TWO

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:30.462
MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND IN

02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:32.965
LIGHT OF THIS FEDERALLY FUNDING.

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:34.433
SOME INFORMATION YOU COULD

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:35.734
GATHER IN THE COMING MONTHS

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:37.336
WOULD BE TO HAVE THE

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:39.738
UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE MORE. DATA

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:41.574

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RESTORE

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.483
MEANING FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:52.251
LEGISLATURE COULD GET

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:53.552
INFORMATION FROM YOU SEE ANY

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:55.154
OTHER SEGMENTS AS TO HOW IT

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.455
INTENDS TO SPEND THESE FEDERAL

02:04:56.522 --> 02:04:57.857
DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT ANY

02:04:57.923 --> 02:04:59.992
STATE FUNDING IS COORDINATED.

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:03.462
AND A COVERING- I THINK FILLING

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:04.063

IDENTIFIED SOME OVERARCHING

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:12.071
CONCERNS WE'VE HAD WITH THE

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.873
STATE'S EXISTING APPROACH ON

02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:15.674
THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED BASIC

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:17.610
NEEDS AS A BUDGET PRIORITY IN

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:20.079
RECENT YEARS BUT HASN'T-

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.614
DEVELOPED A LONG TERM STRATEGY

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.315

COORDINATED WITH THE

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.787
LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE SOME

02:05:28.854 --> 02:05:31.223

LEGISLATURE TO TRACK SOME OF

02:08:57.463 --> 02:08:58.097
THESE INITIATIVES WILL MORE

SECURITY OR WHICHEVER ARE GOING

02:09:24.556 --> 02:09:25.257
TO BE A SEPARATE SET OF

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:30.796
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WOULD BE.

02:09:30.863 --> 02:09:32.431
THE ADVANTAGE OF- SEPARATELY I

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:34.433
THINK OUR MESSAGE THE ON THE-

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.568
NON- ON GO FUNDING JUST BECAUSE-

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:38.170
THESE ISSUES ARE SOMEWHAT THERE.

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:39.571
FOR EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:41.507
COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE OF A

02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:42.374
ONE TIME ISSUE THERE COULD BE

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:44.443
SOME ONGOING ISSUES TOO BUT

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.311
THOSE THOSE WOULD BE UP. EARLY

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.980
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND-

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:49.014
STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

SOMETHING A LEGISLATURE OF

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:53.252
WANTED TACKLE SEPARATELY. YEAH

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.953
I CONCUR WITH THAT FIRST OF ALL

WHAT IT IS USED IN THE BULLETS.

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:50.215
OF THE FIVE ISSUES WE AT WILL

02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:52.016
RAISE CONCERNS OF THREE ON I'LL

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:56.087
GO THROUGH EACH- PROPOSAL WE

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:57.622
HAVE CONCERTS. THE FIRST IS ON

02:19:57.689 --> 02:19:59.357
THAT TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:01.793
DOLLARS FOR PRIME- THIS IS AN

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.294
AREA WHERE WE THINK THE

02:20:03.361 --> 02:20:05.296
ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED A

02:20:05.363 --> 02:20:07.966
COMMENDABLE- ISSUE FOR

02:20:08.032 --> 02:20:09.100
CONSIDERATION THIS YEAR'S

02:20:09.167 --> 02:20:10.802
BUDGET WHICH IS ADDRESSING LONG

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:11.970
STANDING OUTSIDE EQUITIES

02:20:12.036 --> 02:20:17.375
ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE SOME.

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:17.909
CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:18.543
PROPOSAL. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:19.944
AROUND THE FACT THAT THE

02:20:20.011 --> 02:20:22.280
PROPOSAL LACKS A FEW WANT

02:20:22.347 --> 02:20:24.082
ESSENTIAL LONG TERM PLANS THAT

02:20:24.149 --> 02:20:25.416
WE THINK ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS

02:20:25.483 --> 02:20:27.218
THE INTENDED GOALS OF THAT

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:29.687
PROPOSAL. FOR EXAMPLE- THE

02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:30.889
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.824
UNIVERSITY HAVE NOT- DEVELOP A

02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:34.793
LONG TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS

02:20:34.859 --> 02:20:35.660
HEALTH EQUITY ISSUES ACROSS THE

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:37.295
STATE WITHOUT THIS LONG TERM

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:39.764
PLAN IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:41.966
WHERE THE REMAINING GAPS ARE

02:20:42.033 --> 02:20:43.635
WHICH TYPES OF THE GAPS ARE NOT

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.370
COVERED BY PRINT PROGRAMS. IN

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:48.573
WHICH WOULD REMAIN UNADDRESSED

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:49.707
UNDER THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL.

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.709
TWO SECONDS- THE PROPOSED

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:53.278
BUDGET APPROACH TO SUPPORT

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.079
ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THAT

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.681
PROPOSAL. HAS INTERVIEW SEVERAL

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:58.650
WEAKNESSES JUST A SITE ONE

02:20:58.716 --> 02:21:00.385
NOTABLE EXAMPLE- THE

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:02.020
UNIVERSITY'S ASKING FOR FUNDING

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:03.454
UP FRONT FOR GROWTH THAT WILL

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:05.690
NOT BE MATERIALIZED FOR.

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:07.692
SEVERAL YEARS WE THINK THIS IS

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:08.827
NOT ONLY INEFFICIENT BECAUSE IT

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:11.029
PROVIDES FUNDING IN YEARS WHERE

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:11.896
THE COST HAVEN'T NECESSARILY

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:13.598
OCCURRED IT ALSO WEAKENS

02:21:13.665 --> 02:21:16.901
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:17.969
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT GROWTH.

02:21:18.036 --> 02:21:19.537
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE.

02:21:19.604 --> 02:21:20.371
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.406
BUDGET APPROACH WE HAVE

02:21:21.472 --> 02:21:22.774
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED

02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:24.509
PERSON FUNDING RATE. THE

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:25.710
PROPOSAL DOESN'T HAVE AN

02:21:25.777 --> 02:21:27.011
ENROLLMENT TARGET SO THE

02:21:27.078 --> 02:21:28.346
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:21:28.413 --> 02:21:29.948
HOLD YOU SEE ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:21:30.014 --> 02:21:31.749
THIS GROSS. AND THEN THERE'S A

02:21:31.816 --> 02:21:33.117
THE PROPOSAL ALSO WOULDN'T HAVE

02:21:33.184 --> 02:21:35.186
ANY REPORTING ON OUTCOMES THE

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:36.855
PROGRAMS A LEGISLATURE REVENUE

02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:39.657
CONSISTENT WAY TO EVALUATE ON

02:21:39.724 --> 02:21:41.459
PROGRAMS IN FUTURE YEARS. AND

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:42.393
THEN ARE THIRD CONCERNED WITH

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.128
THE UC PRIME PROPOSAL IS THAT A

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:46.130
SIZABLE PORTION OF THE FUNDS-

02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:47.265
ARE NOT FOR A MOMENT GROWTH BUT

02:21:47.332 --> 02:21:49.100
ARE INTENDED TO BOLSTER.

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:51.102
SUPPORT FOR EXISTING ENROLLMENT

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:53.438
AT EXISTING PROGRAMS. I'M THIS

02:21:53.504 --> 02:21:54.706
COULD POTENTIALLY BE JUSTIFIED

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:56.441
FOR EXAMPLE PORTION OF THE

02:21:56.507 --> 02:21:58.042
FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT FINANCIAL

02:21:58.109 --> 02:22:00.078
AID- BUT IN OUR VIEW YOU SEE

02:22:00.144 --> 02:22:01.913
HAS NOT JUSTIFIED THE BULK OF

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.781
THIS ENHANCEMENT FUNDING. AND

02:22:03.848 --> 02:22:05.183
EVEN FOR FINANCIAL AID WORK AT

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.085
THE EVENTUALLY BE WARRANTED.

02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:08.253
YOU SEE HAS NOT PROVIDED ENOUGH

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:09.754
INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE

02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:12.757
STUDENTS FINANCIAL NEED TO

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:13.358
REALLY ASSESS WHETHER. I WAS

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:17.095
FUNDING JUSTIFIED. SO IS THE

02:22:17.161 --> 02:22:17.729
CASE WE THINK THE LARGEST COULD

02:22:17.795 --> 02:22:18.863
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:20.198
UNIVERSITY TO COME BACK WITH A

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:20.899
STRONGER PROPOSAL THAT

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:22.200
ADDRESSES EACH ONE OF OUR

02:22:22.267 --> 02:22:25.536
CONCERNS. SECOND PROPOSAL I'D

02:22:25.603 --> 02:22:28.373
LIKE TO. DISCUSS IS THAT

02:22:28.439 --> 02:22:29.841
CALIFORNIA'S TWO FOR SCIENCE

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:31.542
AND INNOVATION. MINISTRATIONS

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:33.544
PROPOSING TWENTY MILLION

02:22:33.611 --> 02:22:34.145
DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:36.247
HERE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE

02:22:36.314 --> 02:22:38.383
PROPOSAL APPEARS TO HAVE A VERY

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:40.118
NARROW OR IT WOULD HAVE A VERY

02:22:40.184 --> 02:22:42.921
NARROW IMPACT IT WOULD SUPPORT

02:22:42.987 --> 02:22:43.521
FIVE HUNDRED FORTY INDIVIDUALS

02:22:43.588 --> 02:22:46.224
ANNUALLY OR ABOUT. TWENTY SEVEN

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:47.191
HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS OVER A FIVE

02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:49.227
YEAR PERIOD IN A NARROW SET OF

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:51.362
INDUSTRIES. THE PROPOSAL

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:52.964
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:54.232
A STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT OF

02:22:54.299 --> 02:22:56.100
WORKFORCE NEEDS AND SO IT'S

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:57.368
UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PROPOSED

02:22:57.435 --> 02:22:59.103
ACTIVITIES AND INDUSTRIES UNDER

02:22:59.170 --> 02:23:01.472
THIS PROPOSAL. ALL REFLECT THE

02:23:01.539 --> 02:23:04.008
STATE'S HIGHEST WORKFORCE NEEDS.

02:23:04.075 --> 02:23:05.009
HERE AGAIN IS A SITUATION WE

02:23:05.076 --> 02:23:05.877
THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:07.045
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:08.212
DEVELOP A BETTER PROPOSAL THAT

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:10.915
REFLECTS OUR CONCERNS. WERE

02:23:10.982 --> 02:23:12.483
ALTERNATIVELY IT COULD REJECTED

02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:14.285
THIS PROPOSAL REDIRECT THE

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:15.920
FUNDING FOR OTHER- HIGH

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:18.323
PRIORITIES THINGS LIKE DEFERRED

02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:20.692
MAINTENANCE FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE

02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:23.161
FINAL OF. PROPOSAL I WANT TO

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:23.661
DISCUSS IS PROFESSIONAL

02:23:23.728 --> 02:23:26.364
DEVELOPMENT. SO HERE AGAIN OF

02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:27.598
THE RESTORATION HAS IDENTIFIED

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:28.666
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD A

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:30.101
LOT OF THE FIELD WHICH IS THAT

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:32.070
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAS.

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.104
BEEN A HIGH PRIORITY

02:23:33.171 --> 02:23:34.973
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF KOBE

02:23:35.039 --> 02:23:35.440
IN THE MOVE TO REMOTE

02:23:35.506 --> 02:23:37.375
INSTRUCTION. THE ISSUE HERE IS

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:38.409
THAT THE UNIVERSITY IN THE

02:23:38.476 --> 02:23:39.210
ADMINISTRATION HAVE NOT

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:40.678
PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE A

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:42.013
NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF FACULTY

CERTAINLY UNDERSERVED- IN THE

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:15.086
NUMBER OF DOCTORS AND I THINK

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:17.655
THIS PANDEMIC. HAS ONLY

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:19.724
HIGHLIGHTED THE INEQUALITIES

02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:22.393
AND IN THE MEDICAL CARE THAT

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:23.294
EXIST WITHIN THE STATE OF

02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:26.564
CALIFORNIA- WE THE RATIO AND I

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:28.032
WISH I REMEMBERED WHAT THAT

02:28:28.099 --> 02:28:30.167
RATIO AS THE RATIO OF. OF THE

MUCH LOWER THAN THE COASTAL

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:44.348
AREAS- SO THEREFORE. THE NEED

02:28:44.415 --> 02:28:47.218
FOR- DOCTORS IN UNDERSERVED

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:50.254

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.695

02:28:57.762 --> 02:29:01.198
A PROGRAM BETWEEN. UC MERCED-

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:02.967

OF THIS- YOU KNOW I'M NEED FOR-

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:22.086
MORE DOCTORS AND THEN AS THE

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:23.854
UCR'S SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS

02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:27.358

MORE BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:37.068
OF- OF CULTURE AND LANGUAGE I

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:40.004
KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:42.340
HERE BUT THE UC IRVINE HAS A

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:45.943
SPECIAL PRIME PROGRAM TO TRAIN

DIVERSITY. OF THE UCR SCHOOL OF

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.336
MEDICINE STUDENTS GRADUATE I

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:14.338
WAS JUST AS IMPRESSED WITH THE

02:30:17.608 --> 02:30:21.011

02:30:34.592 --> 02:30:36.827
COMPETENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:39.163
A DIVERSE POPULATION SO I

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:42.500
CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:45.970
ABOUT PRIME. I THINK THE TWELVE

02:30:46.036 --> 02:30:47.605
POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:52.877
CERTAINLY- MONEY WELL SPENT- TO

THE CONCERNS OF THE L. A. O. I

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:56.814
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE WOULD

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:59.383
PROBABLY BE MECHANISMS THAT WE

02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.352

THE CURRENT PROPOSAL YOU SEE

02:48:35.772 --> 02:48:38.908
PRIORITIZATION. ON THE MARGINS

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:53.022
AS IT IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED

02:48:53.089 --> 02:48:55.291

02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:34.831
SOMETHING THAT CSX STAFF ARE

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:37.400

THE CALGARY FORM IN LARGE PART

02:50:25.281 --> 02:50:27.283

INSTITUTIONAL A PROGRAM WHICH

PROCESS AND AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:04:50.045 --> 03:04:51.980
THAT. EACH CAMPUS AND OUR

03:04:52.047 --> 03:04:55.350
SYSTEM THAT- STRETCH GOALS FOR

03:04:55.417 --> 03:04:58.086
THEIR OVERALL GRADUATION RATES

03:05:04.159 --> 03:05:05.394
EMBEDDED IN THOSE GOALS WAS THE

03:05:05.461 --> 03:05:07.629
ABSOLUTE ELIMINATION. OF EQUITY

03:05:07.696 --> 03:05:10.065
GAPS BY RACE ETHNICITY BY

03:05:10.132 --> 03:05:11.767
HEALTH STATUS AND BY FIRST

03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:13.001
GENERATION COLLEGE ATTENDANCE

03:05:13.068 --> 03:05:14.870
STATUS. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

03:05:14.937 --> 03:05:16.038
CAMPUSES THAT ARE ALREADY

03:05:16.104 --> 03:05:17.439
ZEROED OUT THOSE GOALS THAT YOU

03:05:17.506 --> 03:05:18.340
MARK MAY HAVE HEARD FROM

03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:19.975
CHANCER CASTRO WHEN HE SPOKE TO

03:05:20.042 --> 03:05:21.610
THIS COMMITTEE- BUT WE HAVE

03:05:21.677 --> 03:05:23.145
OTHER CAMPUSES THAT STILL HAVE

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:24.713
WORK TO DO AND SO. FIRST AND

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:26.081
FOREMOST IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

03:05:26.148 --> 03:05:27.649
OF INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:29.685
OUR CAMPUSES I'VE HEARD CHANCER

03:05:29.751 --> 03:05:31.687
CASTRO NOTE THAT FOR EXAMPLE WE

03:05:31.753 --> 03:05:33.422
HAVE THREE C. ISSUES IN THE

03:05:33.489 --> 03:05:35.290
CENTRAL VALLEY- ONE OF THOSE

03:05:35.357 --> 03:05:37.159
CAMPUSES ARE STANISLAUS HAS

03:05:37.226 --> 03:05:38.861
EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED THEIR

03:05:38.927 --> 03:05:40.762
EQUITY GAP FOR PELL STUDENTS.

03:05:40.829 --> 03:05:42.931
SO AGAIN SHARING THOSE

03:05:42.998 --> 03:05:44.099
EXPERIENCES AND THOSE

03:05:44.166 --> 03:05:45.701
STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED

03:05:45.767 --> 03:05:47.703
ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES SO THAT'S

03:05:47.769 --> 03:05:49.004
ONE ELEMENT IS REALLY

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:50.739
BENEFITING FROM THE LEARNED AND

03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:52.741
LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF OUR CSU

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:54.176
CAMPUSES AND THEIR LEADERS AND

03:05:54.243 --> 03:05:55.744
STUDENTS TODAY THE SECOND

03:05:55.811 --> 03:05:58.046
ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT THREE WEEKS

03:05:58.113 --> 03:06:00.282
AGO WE DELIVERED TO EVERY CSU

03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:03.318
PRESIDENT- THROUGH AN EQUITY

03:06:03.385 --> 03:06:05.821
REPORT- LOOKING AT THEIR

03:06:05.888 --> 03:06:07.990
TRAJECTORY TO THE TWENTY TWENTY

03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:09.258
FIVE GOAL OF ELIMINATING EQUITY

03:06:09.324 --> 03:06:11.026
GAPS. AND AROUND THAT WERE

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:12.594
THREE SORT OF STRATEGIC AREAS

03:06:12.661 --> 03:06:14.296
OF FOCUS THAT WE ENCOURAGE EACH

03:06:14.363 --> 03:06:15.931
CAMPUS TO REALLY BUILD AND MORE

03:06:15.998 --> 03:06:18.500
DETAILED PLAN AROUND- FIRST WAS

03:06:18.567 --> 03:06:19.768
ON STUDENTS THAT HAD ALREADY

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:22.104
LEFT THE CSU AND HOW TO RE

03:06:22.170 --> 03:06:24.406
ENGAGE THOSE STUDENTS- IF THEY

03:06:24.473 --> 03:06:25.941
BEGAN AND LET'S SAY PAUL

03:06:26.008 --> 03:06:27.142
NINETEEN OR FULL TWENTY. THAT

03:06:27.209 --> 03:06:28.277
PERHAPSOF ALREADY LEFT

03:06:28.343 --> 03:06:29.778
UNIVERSITY STRATEGIES TO RE

03:06:29.845 --> 03:06:31.413
ENGAGE THOSE STUDENTS THE

03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:36.351
SECOND WORST DIDN'T THAT MAY.

03:06:36.418 --> 03:06:36.885
BE AT RISK OF LEAVING THE

03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:37.653
UNIVERSITY YES BASED THEIR YEAR

03:06:37.719 --> 03:06:40.322
PER- OR THE- OF COURSES THEY'VE

03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:41.590
TAKEN. AND THEN THERE WAS A

03:06:41.657 --> 03:06:43.625
THIRD STRATEGY LOOKING AT

03:06:43.692 --> 03:06:46.595
SPECIFICALLY- AREAS AND MAJORS

03:06:46.662 --> 03:06:47.796
AND DISCIPLINES IN WHICH THEY

03:06:47.863 --> 03:06:50.098
ARE MAYBE HIGHER NON PASS RATES

03:06:50.165 --> 03:06:51.199
WITH SOME STRATEGIES AROUND

03:06:51.266 --> 03:06:53.502
THAT SO FROM THAT OUR WORK IS

03:06:53.569 --> 03:06:55.671
REALLY DATA INFORMED AND THAT'S

03:06:55.737 --> 03:06:56.872
BEEN THE FODDER FOR THEIR

03:06:56.939 --> 03:06:58.307
CONVERSATIONS THAT EACH CAMPUS

03:06:58.373 --> 03:07:00.876
WILL BE- GOING BACK TO THOSE

03:07:00.943 --> 03:07:01.777
ORIGINAL PLANS THAT THEY

03:07:01.843 --> 03:07:04.413
DEVELOPED. BUILDING ON THEM

03:07:04.479 --> 03:07:05.013
BASED ON THE PROGRESS THEY'VE

03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:08.216
MADE ALREADY. GREAT THANK YOU.

03:07:08.283 --> 03:07:09.284
NO FOR THE CURRENT QUESTIONS

03:07:09.351 --> 03:07:14.790
CHECK OKAY. THANK YOU- I WANTED

03:07:14.856 --> 03:07:16.925
TO ENGAGE ON THE ENROLLMENT

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:19.928
ISSUES AND THAT THE REDIRECTION.

03:07:19.995 --> 03:07:21.863
SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS

03:07:21.930 --> 03:07:23.131
INTERESTING TIMES THROUGH THE

03:07:23.198 --> 03:07:25.667
PANDEMIC- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU

03:07:25.734 --> 03:07:27.436
CAN PROPERLY ESTIMATE WHERE

03:07:27.502 --> 03:07:29.605
WE'RE AT AS FAR AS DEMAND

03:07:29.671 --> 03:07:30.472
APPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S

03:07:30.539 --> 03:07:32.240
HAPPENING WITH COVER NINETEEN

03:07:32.307 --> 03:07:33.909
BUT WE DID SEE WITH OUR LAST

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:36.945
PANEL HUGE INCREASE OF PERSEUS

YOU SEE OR GETTING A 16%

03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:55.657
INCREASE IN CSU. ADDRESS IS IT

03:08:55.724 --> 03:08:58.760
THE- THE FINANCIAL MEANS FOR

03:08:58.827 --> 03:08:59.795
THE STUDENTS BACK HOME IN THEIR

03:08:59.861 --> 03:09:01.496
FAMILIES MANY THE SAME

03:09:01.563 --> 03:09:02.931
DEMOGRAPHICS FOR THE ARE FOR

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.700
THE UC SELL IT CAN YOU WALK US

03:09:04.766 --> 03:09:09.304
THROUGH. HOW DO YOU TO BE THE

03:09:09.371 --> 03:09:10.272
DIFFERENCE. YEAH AND I THINK

03:09:10.338 --> 03:09:10.872
THERE MULTIPLE RE I THINK THE

03:09:10.939 --> 03:09:11.740
AN X. QUESTION. I WOULD

03:09:11.807 --> 03:09:13.809
ACTUALLY OFF FRIENDLY SUGGESTS

03:09:13.875 --> 03:09:15.811
THAT IN MANY WAYS OUR CSU

03:09:15.877 --> 03:09:17.813
STUDENTS ARE MUCH MORE SIMILAR

03:09:17.879 --> 03:09:19.548
TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

03:09:19.614 --> 03:09:21.683
ENROLLMENTS IN TERMS OF OUR

03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:23.719
FINANCIAL STATUS AND FAMILY

03:09:23.785 --> 03:09:25.287
SITUATIONS SO THERE ARE

03:09:25.353 --> 03:09:27.355
MULTIPLE FACTORS WHAT I WOULD

03:09:27.422 --> 03:09:29.891
SAY IS THAT THE IMPACT ON

03:09:29.958 --> 03:09:33.361
COLLEGE. ACCESS AN ASPIRATION

03:09:33.428 --> 03:09:34.930
IN MANY WAYS HAS MIRRORED THE

03:09:34.996 --> 03:09:36.732
ECONOMIC RECOVERY RIGHT IT'S A

03:09:36.798 --> 03:09:38.967
K. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:41.703
THAT FAMILIES THAT HAVE MORE

03:09:41.770 --> 03:09:43.638
ECONOMIC MEANS. WE'RE SEEING

03:09:43.705 --> 03:09:46.174
LESS VARIANCE IN THEIR DESIRE

03:09:46.241 --> 03:09:48.276
FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND THEN FOR

03:09:48.343 --> 03:09:49.678
FAMILIES THAT ARE MORE

03:09:49.745 --> 03:09:51.880
FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED OUR

03:09:51.947 --> 03:09:53.148
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THAT'S

03:09:53.215 --> 03:09:54.583
CARRYING OUT- DURING THE

03:09:54.649 --> 03:09:56.084
PANDEMIC AND WE IMAGINE POST

03:09:56.151 --> 03:09:58.487
PANDEMIC. WILL HAVE A DECREASED

03:09:58.553 --> 03:10:00.188
DEMAND BECAUSE THEY ARE NEEDING

03:10:00.255 --> 03:10:01.957
TO MEET OTHER LIFE LIFE

03:10:02.023 --> 03:10:04.292
PRIORITIES AT THIS TIME SO WE

03:10:04.359 --> 03:10:05.961
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ONE FACTOR

03:10:06.027 --> 03:10:07.162
THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE

03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:08.563
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT I WANT TO

03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:10.031
BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE STILL

03:10:10.098 --> 03:10:11.867
QUITE PLEASED THAT WE HAD

03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:13.301
EXPECTED THAT THE DROP IN

03:10:13.368 --> 03:10:15.170
APPLICATIONS WILL BE HIGHER-

03:10:15.237 --> 03:10:17.272
TRACKING WITH. OTHER NATIONAL-

03:10:17.339 --> 03:10:20.041
UP FOR OUR PROJECTIONS AND-

03:10:20.108 --> 03:10:21.042
TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING

03:10:21.109 --> 03:10:22.477
NATIONWIDE FOR OUR

03:10:22.544 --> 03:10:25.147
INSTITUTIONAL TYPES SO OUR

03:10:25.213 --> 03:10:27.682
FOCUS IS THAT WE STILL ARE

03:10:27.749 --> 03:10:29.384
COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ACCESS.

03:10:29.451 --> 03:10:31.253
APPLICATIONS ARE ONLY ONE

03:10:31.319 --> 03:10:32.988
NUMBER AND SO IT'S STILL

03:10:33.054 --> 03:10:34.456
IMPORTANT THAT WE ADMIT OUR

03:10:34.523 --> 03:10:36.124
STUDENTS ARE EVERY SINGLE ONE

03:10:36.191 --> 03:10:37.292
THAT IS A QUALIFIED AND

03:10:37.359 --> 03:10:39.294
ELIGIBLE FOR CSU ADMISSION. AND

03:10:39.361 --> 03:10:41.763
HELP GET THEM ENROLLED AND COME

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:43.965
TO COLLEGE SO THAT OUR COLLEGE

03:10:44.032 --> 03:10:45.300
ATTAINMENT WILL BE A PART OF

03:10:45.367 --> 03:10:47.135
THEIR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS

03:10:47.202 --> 03:10:49.104
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. THE

03:10:49.171 --> 03:10:50.972
LAST FACTOR I WOULD ADDRESSES

03:10:51.039 --> 03:10:52.440
THAT ON SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE

03:10:52.507 --> 03:10:54.109
HEARD WE HAVE AN IMPENDING

03:10:54.176 --> 03:10:56.077
ENROLLMENT CLASS. THAT IS

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:57.612
COMING SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:10:57.679 --> 03:10:58.847
APPLICATION NUMBERS THEY

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:01.116
ACTUALLY VARY FROM CAMPUS TO

03:11:01.183 --> 03:11:02.918
CAMPUS SO SOME CAMPUSES STILL%

03:11:02.984 --> 03:11:05.020
SAW AN INCREASE SO OFTEN THAT

03:11:05.086 --> 03:11:09.958
IS IN A DROP. YOU'RE. GONNA SEE

03:11:10.025 --> 03:11:11.159
IT WE'RE GONNA SEE A DROP YES I

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:11.860
AM ONLY CLIPPER FOR TO THE

03:11:11.927 --> 03:11:12.894
PRINT. DRAW OVERALL IN THE NO

03:11:12.961 --> 03:11:15.230
OF NEW. HIGH SCHOOL GRAD- THAT

03:11:15.297 --> 03:11:16.665
WILL BE COMING OUT CALIFORNIA

03:11:16.731 --> 03:11:19.634
ALONE BY TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN

03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:20.735
WHICH IS WHEN THE PROJECTIONS

03:11:20.802 --> 03:11:22.871
GO OUT TO- IS PROJECTED TO

03:11:22.938 --> 03:11:25.574
EXPERIENCE A 16% DECLINE IN THE

03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:27.576
NUMBER OF NEW. HIGH SCHOOL

03:11:27.642 --> 03:11:30.078
GRADUATES SO FOR SOME PARTS OF

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:31.847
CALIFORNIA WE'RE ALREADY

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:32.981
STARTING TO SEE THE IMPACT OF

03:11:33.048 --> 03:11:35.016
THAT- AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

03:11:35.083 --> 03:11:36.918
COUNTRY HAVE ALREADY STARTED

03:11:36.985 --> 03:11:38.820
THEIR DECLINE AS WELL SO I

03:11:38.887 --> 03:11:40.055
THINK THAT IS ANOTHER

03:11:40.121 --> 03:11:41.323
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR THAT WE'RE

03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:42.490
GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

03:11:42.557 --> 03:11:44.059
MONITOR. WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANY

03:11:44.125 --> 03:11:45.627
OTHER STUDENTS AND ADULTS THAT

03:11:45.694 --> 03:11:47.896
WE CONSERVE BUT THAT IS ONE

03:11:47.963 --> 03:11:52.300
PIECE TO LOOK AT. I'M ON THAT

03:11:52.367 --> 03:11:55.437
ISSUE- IT AT THAT IN IT WHAT

03:11:55.503 --> 03:11:56.872
THE ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS

03:11:56.938 --> 03:11:59.140
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS. WAIT WE

03:11:59.207 --> 03:12:02.644
HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE. ALL

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:05.080
IS READY AND MORE STUDENTS WHO

03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:06.882
I THINK ARE REALIZING THAT THE

03:12:06.948 --> 03:12:09.751
TICKET TO A GOOD PAYING JOB IN

03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:10.652
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS MORE

03:12:10.719 --> 03:12:12.053
THAN HIGH SCHOOL SEE EVEN NOW

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:14.122
WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE FEWER. THE

03:12:14.189 --> 03:12:17.092
NUMBER OF PERTH IF YOU WERE AT

03:12:17.158 --> 03:12:18.793
NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:20.495
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT MORE OF

03:12:20.562 --> 03:12:23.098
THOSE EXISTING GRADUATES. CSU

03:12:23.164 --> 03:12:24.900
ELIGIBLE IN REDDING AND SO THE

03:12:24.966 --> 03:12:25.967
IT WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF AN

03:12:26.034 --> 03:12:28.503
IMPACT ON THE DROP IN.

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:29.037
APPLICATIONS ARE YOU STILL

03:12:29.104 --> 03:12:33.909
ANTICIPATE. THE DROP. SO THAT'S

03:12:33.975 --> 03:12:35.577
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND THIS

03:12:35.644 --> 03:12:37.512
REFLECTS THE VERY COMPLICATED

03:12:37.579 --> 03:12:39.180
NATURE RIGHT OF PROJECTING

03:12:39.247 --> 03:12:41.583
IMPACTS ON APPLICATIONS I THINK

03:12:41.650 --> 03:12:43.385
ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THERE

03:12:43.451 --> 03:12:44.953
IS INDICATION THAT A GREATER

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:47.255
PROPORTION OF THEM ARE MORE

03:12:47.322 --> 03:12:49.758
COLLEGE READY BUT THEN HOW THAT

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:51.559
INTERFACES WITH THE TOTAL

03:12:51.626 --> 03:12:54.029
NUMBER AND I WHAT'S IMPORTANT

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:55.497
TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT

03:12:55.563 --> 03:12:57.966
COMPETITION THEN FOR ALL

03:12:58.033 --> 03:12:59.601
STUDENTS RIGHT GRADUATING HIGH

03:12:59.668 --> 03:13:00.702
SCHOOL STUDENTS ACROSS THE

03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:03.405
COUNTRY IS GOING TO INCREASE IN

03:13:03.471 --> 03:13:06.308
INTENSITY SO OTHER STATES FOR

03:13:06.374 --> 03:13:07.609
EXAMPLE THAT ARE GOING TO

03:13:07.676 --> 03:13:08.877
EXPERIENCE A DEEPER DROP MAYBE

03:13:08.944 --> 03:13:10.145
LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA

03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:11.880
CRITICALLY THOSE CAMPUSES ARE

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:13.448
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING

03:13:13.515 --> 03:13:14.249
TO INCREASE THEIR ETHNIC OR

03:13:14.316 --> 03:13:15.917
RACIAL DIVERSITY WILL OFTEN

03:13:15.984 --> 03:13:18.186
COME TO CALIFORNIA. RIGHT TO

03:13:18.253 --> 03:13:20.155
INCREASE- AND ADDRESS THOSE

03:13:20.221 --> 03:13:23.024
GOALS SO I HAVE TO SAY THAT

03:13:23.091 --> 03:13:25.860
WITHOUT OUR ACTUAL DATA GOING

03:13:25.927 --> 03:13:26.761
FORWARD GOING TO HAVE TO

03:13:26.828 --> 03:13:27.829
MONITOR THIS I WOULD BE

03:13:27.896 --> 03:13:29.798
CAUTIOUS ABOUT PROJECTING WHAT

03:13:29.864 --> 03:13:32.367
WILL BE THE NET IMPACT BUT WE

03:13:32.434 --> 03:13:34.536
ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE TO

03:13:34.602 --> 03:13:35.403
ONE THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE

03:13:35.470 --> 03:13:37.439
STUDENTS WE SERVE OUR FOR

03:13:37.505 --> 03:13:39.274
EXAMPLE WE ARE TRYING TO RAISE

03:13:39.341 --> 03:13:41.810
ATTENTION ABOUT THIS STUDENTS

03:13:41.876 --> 03:13:44.179
WHO HAVE ARE OLDER ADULTS AND

03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:46.548
WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE BUT HAVE

03:13:46.614 --> 03:13:47.849
NOT COMPLETED THEIR FOUR YEAR

03:13:47.916 --> 03:13:50.352
DEGREE SO WE WANT TO

03:13:50.418 --> 03:13:51.519
INTENTIONALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE

03:13:51.586 --> 03:13:54.122
SERVE A GREATER PROPORTION OF

03:13:54.189 --> 03:13:56.324
THOSE STUDENTS AS AN EXAMPLE SO

03:13:56.391 --> 03:13:57.859
ACTIONS LIKE THAT COULD HELP

03:13:57.926 --> 03:13:59.694
OFFSET. WHATEVER IN RALEIGH

03:13:59.761 --> 03:14:03.031
CLIP FOR EXPERIENCING FOR HIGH

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:10.271
SCHOOL STUDENTS. OKAY. AND THEN-

03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:15.643
MAYBE RYAN CAN YOU- OR OR OR OR

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.846
YOU AS WELL HERE I'M SORRY FOR

03:14:17.912 --> 03:14:18.446
CATCHING THE AND GET YOUR NAME

03:14:18.513 --> 03:14:22.183
AGAIN. LATELY THE ONE COULD GET

03:14:22.250 --> 03:14:23.184
SOMEBODY FROM THE C. S. YOU

03:14:23.251 --> 03:14:24.786
TALK ABOUT THE REDIRECTION

03:14:24.853 --> 03:14:28.223
POLICY. AND HOW THAT'S GOING SO

03:14:28.289 --> 03:14:31.626
FAR AND- IF WE NEEDED DURING

03:14:31.693 --> 03:14:34.896
THE TO DOING TO ADD TO ADJUSTED

03:14:34.963 --> 03:14:37.832
OCCUR KEEP THAT GUN. I CAN

03:14:37.899 --> 03:14:39.034
CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT MONEY IS

03:14:39.100 --> 03:14:45.040
LOW LOW LOW. OKAY EVERYONE FINE

03:14:45.106 --> 03:14:47.675
ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW SO- WE

03:14:47.742 --> 03:14:50.145
AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- NOW ABOUT

03:14:50.211 --> 03:14:51.646
TWO YEARS UNDER OUR BELT AND I

03:14:51.713 --> 03:14:53.581
BELIEVE THERE IS A SUMMARY OF

03:14:53.648 --> 03:14:57.152
THE REDIRECTION DATA SO WE THIS

03:14:57.218 --> 03:14:58.186
IS BEEN A WONDERFUL LEARNING

03:14:58.253 --> 03:15:00.021
EXPERIENCE FOR US SO WITH TWO

03:15:00.088 --> 03:15:02.557
YEARS UNDER OUR BELTS- I THINK

03:15:02.624 --> 03:15:05.093
YOU WILL SEE IN THE AGENDA THAT

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:06.461
UNFORTUNATELY HAVEN'T HAD

03:15:06.528 --> 03:15:09.330
NECESSARILY- THE YIELD RATE

03:15:09.397 --> 03:15:10.999
THAT WE WOULD LIKE BUT I THINK

03:15:11.066 --> 03:15:12.467
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTICE

03:15:12.534 --> 03:15:13.835
WE HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED

03:15:13.902 --> 03:15:15.737
STUDENTS WHO THEN WERE OFFERED

03:15:15.804 --> 03:15:18.173
ADMISSION TO A CSU THAT MIGHT

03:15:18.239 --> 03:15:19.507
NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN OFFER

03:15:19.574 --> 03:15:23.244
THAT SO IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY

03:15:23.311 --> 03:15:24.245
TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HIGHER

03:15:24.312 --> 03:15:26.581
EDUCATION. R. FOR ACCEPTING

03:15:26.648 --> 03:15:28.416
THEY ARE A NOTABLE NUMBER OF

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:30.618
STUDENTS I THINK WHAT WE

03:15:30.685 --> 03:15:32.821
LEARNED IN THIS IS THAT BOB

03:15:32.887 --> 03:15:34.589
THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF

03:15:34.656 --> 03:15:37.725
CAMPUSES THAT PROVIDE THE

03:15:37.792 --> 03:15:39.194
SIGNIFICANT AN ALMOST

03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:40.762
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE

03:15:40.829 --> 03:15:42.530
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO END UP

03:15:42.597 --> 03:15:44.232
BEING PRETTY DIRECT IT AND THE

03:15:44.299 --> 03:15:45.366
REALITY OF IT IS THAT

03:15:45.433 --> 03:15:46.534
ULTIMATELY STUDENTS ARE

03:15:46.601 --> 03:15:48.803
APPLYING TO A CAMPUS RIGHT THE

03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:50.305
CAMPUS HAS THE BRAND THE CAMPUS

03:15:50.371 --> 03:15:51.739
HAS THE IDENTITY THAT THE

03:15:51.806 --> 03:15:53.475
CAMPUS HAS THE DISTINCTIVE

03:15:53.541 --> 03:15:55.376
PERSONALITY ARE ATTRIBUTES ARE

03:15:55.443 --> 03:15:56.711
CLIMATE THAT THE STUDENT IS

03:15:56.778 --> 03:15:58.346
SEEKING AND THAT IS WHERE THEY

03:15:58.413 --> 03:16:00.648
ASPIRE TO GO AND STILL OFFERING

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:02.851
REDIRECTION FOR SOME STUDENTS

03:16:02.917 --> 03:16:05.120
IF THAT WAS NOT AS SIGNIFICANT

03:16:05.186 --> 03:16:06.287
AN ASPECT OF THEIR COLLEGE

03:16:06.354 --> 03:16:08.389
CHOICE- THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED

03:16:08.456 --> 03:16:10.091
IN BEING ABLE TO JUST GET THE

03:16:10.158 --> 03:16:11.426
COLLEGE DEGREE. BUT WE'RE

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:12.994
SEEING THAT FOR A LARGE NUMBER

03:16:13.061 --> 03:16:14.796
OF OUR STUDENTS TO REDIRECT THE

03:16:14.863 --> 03:16:18.066
pSIMPLY BEING REFUSE BECAUSE

03:16:18.133 --> 03:16:19.868
THAT DOESN'T THEM MATCH WHAT

03:16:19.934 --> 03:16:21.302
THEIR COLLEGE ASPIRATIONS LIES

03:16:21.369 --> 03:16:22.670
SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

03:16:22.737 --> 03:16:24.372
WORK ON COMMUNICATION

03:16:24.439 --> 03:16:26.574
TECHNIQUES WE DO BELIEVE THAT

03:16:26.641 --> 03:16:28.743
IN THE FORTHCOMING YEARS WHERE

03:16:28.810 --> 03:16:30.778
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WILL BE

03:16:30.845 --> 03:16:31.980
CHALLENGING FOR MANY OF OUR

03:16:32.046 --> 03:16:33.882
FAMILIES AS THEY FACE RECOVERY

03:16:33.948 --> 03:16:35.750
IN THE POST PANDEMIC ERA THAT

03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:37.685
THERE WILL BE SOME PRESSURE- TO

03:16:37.752 --> 03:16:40.155
GO TO CAMPUSES THAT ARE CLOSER

03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:44.392
TO THEM SO WE'RE GOING. TO

03:16:44.459 --> 03:16:44.993
WATCH AND CERTAINLY EVALUATE I

03:16:45.059 --> 03:16:46.427
NEXT YEAR THE NEXT ROUND OR- TO

03:16:46.494 --> 03:16:51.499
THE THERE WERE AN IN. YES THANK

03:16:51.566 --> 03:16:53.935
YOU SEMIRAMIDE AT US SO DOES

03:16:54.002 --> 03:16:56.104
THE CSU HAVE A TO HAVE DATA ON

03:16:56.171 --> 03:16:57.572
WHETHER RE DIRECTED STUDENTS

03:16:57.639 --> 03:16:59.073
WHO DO NOT ENROLL IN THE CSU

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:00.742
CAMPUS CHOOSE TO ENROLL IN

03:17:00.808 --> 03:17:02.710
ANOTHER COLLEGE UNIVERSITY AND

03:17:02.777 --> 03:17:04.612
WHAT AND WHAT A HEARING IN IN

03:17:04.679 --> 03:17:05.914
IN YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE

03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:09.517
GONNA EVALUATE. OVER THE NEXT

03:17:09.584 --> 03:17:10.151
YEAR ARE YOU COLLECTING DATA ON

03:17:10.218 --> 03:17:13.888
THIS. WE DO HAVE SOME DATA SO

03:17:13.955 --> 03:17:16.124
FOR EXAMPLE IN LOOKING AT ALL

03:17:16.191 --> 03:17:17.225
STUDENTS WHO ARE STILL WHICH

03:17:17.292 --> 03:17:19.327
CSU ELIGIBLE AND WHO DON'T END

03:17:19.394 --> 03:17:22.430
UP. ARE COMING TO ENROLLING AT

03:17:22.497 --> 03:17:24.899
A CSU PER SE WELL WE KNOW THAT

03:17:24.966 --> 03:17:27.101
MANY OF THEM DO END UP GOING TO

03:17:27.168 --> 03:17:29.037
EITHER- I COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR

03:17:29.103 --> 03:17:31.039
YOU SEE SO THE OTHER SEGMENTS

03:17:31.105 --> 03:17:32.140
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:17:32.207 --> 03:17:34.709
IRONICALLY- OUR SOME OF OUR OUR

03:17:34.776 --> 03:17:36.477
MOST SIGNIFICANT. COMPETITORS

03:17:36.544 --> 03:17:39.013
WERE ALSO MONITORING TO SEE HOW

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:41.282
MANY STUDENTS ARE ARE GOING OUT

03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:44.552
OF STATE- BUT RIGHT NOW THE

03:17:44.619 --> 03:17:46.287
LARGEST PERCENTAGES IN THOSE

03:17:46.354 --> 03:17:48.456
AREAS WHAT IS INTERESTING. IS

03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:50.825
THAT THERE THERE WAS A GROUP OF

03:17:50.892 --> 03:17:52.427
STUDENTS THAT IT DID NOT APPEAR

03:17:52.493 --> 03:17:54.729
HAD NECESSARILY GONE TO ANOTHER

03:17:54.796 --> 03:17:56.598
INSTITUTION. THAT WE COULD SEE

03:17:56.664 --> 03:17:58.333
WITHIN THAT THAT IMMEDIATE YEAR

03:17:58.399 --> 03:18:00.235
NOT A LARGE NUMBER- BUT THAT

03:18:00.301 --> 03:18:01.703
IT'S JUST SOMETHING OF INTEREST

03:18:01.769 --> 03:18:03.771
TO NOTE BUT FOR SURE OVER 60%

03:18:03.838 --> 03:18:04.973
WE WOULD SAY ARE GOING TO

03:18:05.039 --> 03:18:08.943
EITHER C. C. OR TO A UC CAMPUS.

03:18:09.010 --> 03:18:14.682
THANK YOU. WELL I THINK THIS IS

03:18:14.749 --> 03:18:19.420
A- AND THE IDEA THAT THAT- HAS

03:18:19.487 --> 03:18:20.989
BEEN EMBRACE IT IS WORKING AND

03:18:21.055 --> 03:18:22.590
I'LL GIVE CREDIT TO OUR BUDGET

03:18:22.657 --> 03:18:24.959

TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS- A FEW

03:18:27.028 --> 03:18:29.330
YEARS AGO AND- I THINK IT'S

03:18:29.397 --> 03:18:31.466
WORKING SO BUT UNDERSTAND THAT

03:18:31.532 --> 03:18:32.867
THIS IS NOT THAT THE OVERALL

03:18:32.934 --> 03:18:34.469
BUDGET ISSUE WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:18:34.535 --> 03:18:36.604

LARGER PICTURE AND LOOKING AT

03:18:46.714 --> 03:18:47.215

BUDGET PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT'S

03:19:00.828 --> 03:19:02.597
YOUR BASICALLY HOT TAKE ON THE

03:19:02.664 --> 03:19:05.867
FEDERAL STIMULUS BROWN THREE-

03:19:05.933 --> 03:19:07.235
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOING TO

03:19:07.302 --> 03:19:09.537
BE I THINK FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

03:19:09.604 --> 03:19:13.308
FOR HIGHER ED. FOR- CAN. SEVEN

03:19:13.374 --> 03:19:14.676
THAT GOES DIRECTLY FOR STUDENTS

03:19:14.742 --> 03:19:16.177
OF COURSE FINANCIAL AID IS

03:19:16.244 --> 03:19:19.280
IMPORTANT BUT- SUFFER COMMITTEE

03:19:19.347 --> 03:19:19.847
CALLS BUT LOOKS LIKE ABOUT A

03:19:19.914 --> 03:19:22.650
BILLION. I BELIEVE KLIENT

WHAT THE CSU WILL DO WHAT YOUR

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.824
SHARE ASSUMING THAT THE HOUSE

03:19:29.891 --> 03:19:31.125
PASSES IT AND GET SIGNED BY THE

03:19:31.192 --> 03:19:33.061
PRESIDENT BUT THAT LOOKS TO BE.

03:19:33.127 --> 03:19:35.496
THE CASE TODAY. YEAH THE OTHER

03:19:35.563 --> 03:19:36.864
SIDE THERE SEEMS TO MAJOR

03:19:36.931 --> 03:19:40.134
PIECES OF THE- THE NEW S.

03:19:40.201 --> 03:19:43.004
RABBITS. LEGISLATION FIRST.

03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:45.006
THERE IS AID TO STUDENTS WHICH

03:19:45.073 --> 03:19:47.542
IS ABOUT 50% OF THAT. AND THEN

03:19:47.608 --> 03:19:50.345
THERE IS- INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS

03:19:50.411 --> 03:19:53.247
WERE INSTITUTIONALLY. THAT'S

03:19:53.314 --> 03:19:54.916
THE OTHER PORTION OF THAT-

03:19:54.982 --> 03:19:56.584
GRAND TOTAL FROM AN

03:19:56.651 --> 03:19:57.485
INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT

03:19:57.552 --> 03:20:02.123
PERSPECTIVE- WE ANTICIPATE- WE

03:20:02.190 --> 03:20:09.263
ANTICIPATE. GO AHEAD RANK. OKAY

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:11.466
I'M SORRY I LOOK AT MY SCREEN

03:20:11.532 --> 03:20:12.800
WAS NOT WORKING WELL SO I

03:20:12.867 --> 03:20:14.869
PAUSED AND HEARD SOME SOME

03:20:14.936 --> 03:20:16.137
NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND BUT

03:20:16.204 --> 03:20:17.872
ANYWAY I THE GRAND TOTAL THAT

03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:18.873
WE ANTICIPATE RESPONSE

03:20:18.940 --> 03:20:20.942
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OUT OF

03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:21.809
SOME OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE

03:20:21.876 --> 03:20:23.811
FEDERAL ATTACK I READ THAT WE

03:20:23.878 --> 03:20:25.580
ANTICIPATE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

03:20:25.646 --> 03:20:27.181
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT

03:20:27.248 --> 03:20:28.049
COULD BE USED IN INSTITUTIONAL

03:20:28.116 --> 03:20:30.718
AID. TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPUS IS

03:20:30.785 --> 03:20:31.719
NOW THERE'S A BIG CARRY OUT

03:20:31.786 --> 03:20:33.988
WITH THAT THIS IS NOT SEVEN

03:20:34.055 --> 03:20:34.589
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

03:20:34.655 --> 03:20:36.057
THAT YOU CAN ONE SPEND ON

03:20:36.124 --> 03:20:38.993
ANYTHING YET GENERALLY AREN'T

03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:41.062
ARE INTELLIGENT SAYS THAT WE

03:20:41.129 --> 03:20:42.764
WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS

03:20:42.830 --> 03:20:44.499
FUNDING A LOT LIKE THAT FIRST

03:20:44.565 --> 03:20:45.967
TWO ROUNDS OF THE FEDERAL

03:20:46.033 --> 03:20:47.802
ASSISTANCE WHICH WAS TO

03:20:47.869 --> 03:20:50.338
REIMBURSE REVENUE LOSSES AND

03:20:50.405 --> 03:20:52.507
CAN COVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

03:20:52.573 --> 03:20:54.142
THAT WHAT THE CAN DOWN NEXT. SO

03:20:54.208 --> 03:20:55.643
THAT THAT WILL HAVE A CERTAIN

03:20:55.710 --> 03:20:57.278
LIMITATION THE OTHER MAJOR

03:20:57.345 --> 03:21:01.449
LIMITATION OF COURSE IS THAT.

03:21:01.516 --> 03:21:02.350
IT'S ONE TIME FUNDING. THAT'S

03:21:02.417 --> 03:21:03.818
THE MAG. THAT WE BEGINNING ALL

03:21:03.885 --> 03:21:05.987
IN INTO OF. SYSTEM TO THE

03:21:06.053 --> 03:21:08.790
UNIVERSE. FROM ALL THREE ROUNDS

03:21:08.856 --> 03:21:10.525
OF FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL

03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:11.292
GOVERNMENT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:12.794
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY TWO

03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:15.663
BILLION DOLLARS. I'M SORRY NO

03:21:15.730 --> 03:21:17.265
ONE POINT SIX MILLION ONE POINT

03:21:17.331 --> 03:21:19.667
SIX BILLION DOLLARS. I HAD I

03:21:19.734 --> 03:21:21.669
HAD A COUPLE OF A SUB SUB

03:21:21.736 --> 03:21:24.338
TOTALS. ONE POINT SIX BILLION

03:21:24.405 --> 03:21:26.140
TO ASSIST WITH A NUMBER OF. I

03:21:26.207 --> 03:21:27.842
CHALLENGES THAT ALL OF OUR ALL

03:21:27.909 --> 03:21:28.609
OF OUR ELEMENTS WERE

03:21:28.676 --> 03:21:30.411
UNIVERSALLY OR FACE YES SO IN

03:21:30.478 --> 03:21:32.079
PLAIN ENGLISH THAT ONE TIME

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:34.615
MONEY WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU

03:21:34.682 --> 03:21:35.249
DO IT WELL WHAT CAMPUS IS DOING

03:21:35.316 --> 03:21:38.419
THAT. WELL CERTAINLY ONE OF THE

03:21:38.486 --> 03:21:39.086
THINGS THAT HAS BEEN A

03:21:39.153 --> 03:21:41.155
CHALLENGE FOR US HAS BEEN A

03:21:41.222 --> 03:21:43.324
LOSS OF PARKING REVENUE. AND

03:21:43.391 --> 03:21:45.560
HOUSING HOUSING IS STILL VERY

03:21:45.626 --> 03:21:47.795
LIMITED ON OUR CAMPUSES. AND SO

03:21:47.862 --> 03:21:49.397
THAT WOULD REIMBURSE THE IT WAS

03:21:49.464 --> 03:21:51.199
PROGRAMS STUMBLE ACROSS THIS

03:21:51.265 --> 03:21:53.201
BELT CAN. SIMPLY BACK FILL FOR

03:21:53.267 --> 03:21:55.203
COVERED LOSSES RIGHT. RIGHT THE

03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:58.105
OTHER THING TOO IS THAT WE HAVE

03:21:58.172 --> 03:22:00.107
LOTS OF COSTS RELATED TO- WE

03:22:00.174 --> 03:22:01.175
ANNUALLY LIKE EVERY OTHER STATE

03:22:01.242 --> 03:22:03.444
AGENCY BE TO ROUTE REQUIRE OUR

03:22:03.511 --> 03:22:05.112
COST IMPLICATIONS TO THE

03:22:05.179 --> 03:22:06.447
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ON A

03:22:06.514 --> 03:22:08.683
PERIODIC BASIS WERE WELL OVER A

03:22:08.749 --> 03:22:10.384
HUNDRED MILLION THERE- I AM

03:22:10.451 --> 03:22:11.786
TELLING AND WE ALSO ARE

03:22:11.853 --> 03:22:13.321

ISN'T AS LARGE AS THE UC EVEN.

04:57:48.016 --> 04:57:48.850
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TWICE AS

04:57:48.917 --> 04:57:51.620
MANY CAMPUSES SO THAT RAISES A-

04:57:51.687 --> 04:57:52.554
GREAT NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

04:57:52.621 --> 04:57:56.391
GRANTED. SOME OF THE UC CAMPUS

CALIFORNIA- BUT THIS IS AN

04:58:02.664 --> 04:58:04.399
ISSUE THAT WILL CERTAINLY TAKE

04:58:04.466 --> 04:58:05.400
A LOOK AT POTENTIALLY PUTTING

04:58:05.467 --> 04:58:06.868
MORE MONEY IN THERE DEPENDING

04:58:06.935 --> 04:58:09.037

THROUGH OUR PACKET IN THE LOOK

04:58:50.245 --> 04:58:52.848
AT THE REDIRECTION I. KNEW THAT

04:58:52.914 --> 04:58:54.116
THE MINGUS HILLS WAS RECEIVING

04:58:54.182 --> 04:58:55.317
A NUMBER OF READ DIRECTIONS I

04:58:55.384 --> 04:58:56.652
DIDN'T REALIZE THE SAN

04:58:56.718 --> 04:58:57.686
FRANCISCO STATE I GOT UP THERE

04:58:57.753 --> 04:58:59.187
SO. WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MY

04:58:59.254 --> 04:59:00.989
DISTRICTS ARE REALLY HAPPY TO

04:59:01.056 --> 04:59:05.327
SEE. THAT- ALL. OF TO BOTH

04:59:05.394 --> 04:59:06.495
THOSE CAMPUSES ARE TAKING

04:59:06.561 --> 04:59:09.197
ADVANTAGE IN AND ROLLING- RE

04:59:09.264 --> 04:59:10.632
DIRECTED STUDENTS I JUST WANT

04:59:10.699 --> 04:59:12.401
TO GET A SENSE ON HOW THAT. HOW

04:59:12.467 --> 04:59:14.002
THAT POLICIES GOING I SEE THAT

04:59:14.069 --> 04:59:16.071
THERE WAS QUITE A DROP IN TERMS

04:59:16.138 --> 04:59:16.805
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE OFFERED RE

04:59:16.872 --> 04:59:19.341
DIRECTION BUT- THE ENVIRONMENT

04:59:19.408 --> 04:59:22.644
WAS- FAIRLY STEADY BETWEEN.

04:59:22.711 --> 04:59:25.113
NINETEEN AND TWENTY BUCKS

04:59:25.180 --> 04:59:25.681
CURIOUS HOW THAT HOW THAT'S

04:59:25.747 --> 04:59:27.849
GOING. YES SIR THANK YOU FOR

04:59:27.916 --> 04:59:29.918
THAT QUESTION. SO MAYBE IN

04:59:29.985 --> 04:59:32.554
TERMS OF IDENTIFYING. NOT ALL

04:59:32.621 --> 04:59:34.990
CAMPUSES RECEIVED REDIRECTED

04:59:35.057 --> 04:59:36.958
RIGHTS OUR FOCUS REALLY WAS ON

04:59:37.025 --> 04:59:38.727
CSU CAMPUSES THAT ARE NOT

04:59:38.794 --> 04:59:40.595
CURRENTLY IMPACTED THE IDEA

04:59:40.662 --> 04:59:41.930
BEING THAT THERE IS AVAILABLE

04:59:41.997 --> 04:59:43.899
CAPACITY SO OKAY SO I WANTED TO

04:59:43.965 --> 04:59:45.701
CLARIFY THAT. IN TERMS OF THE

04:59:45.767 --> 04:59:47.669
NUMBERS I CAN SEE WHY THERE IS

04:59:47.736 --> 04:59:49.771
A QUESTION ABOUT THAT. SO FROM

04:59:49.838 --> 04:59:52.541
FALL TWENTY NINETEEN TO FALL

04:59:52.607 --> 04:59:53.975
TWENTY TWENTY OCT IT MORE

04:59:54.042 --> 04:59:56.211
STUDENTS WERE ALSO BEING

04:59:56.278 --> 04:59:58.146
ADMITTED RIGHT TO THE ORIGINAL

04:59:58.213 --> 05:00:01.216
CSU THAT THEY APPLY TO. SO THEN

05:00:01.283 --> 05:00:03.752
THAT RESULTED IN A SMALLER POOL

05:00:03.819 --> 05:00:05.220
OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE SEARS

05:00:05.287 --> 05:00:07.789
YOU ELIGIBLE AND THEREFORE.

05:00:07.856 --> 05:00:09.424
AVAILABLE FOR REDIRECTION SO

05:00:09.491 --> 05:00:11.026
THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

05:00:11.093 --> 05:00:14.129
LIGHT THAT THE NUMBERS APPEAR

05:00:14.196 --> 05:00:16.431
TO NOT A LINE. IT'S A GREAT

05:00:16.498 --> 05:00:19.401
DEAL DO YOU FEEL LIKE- YOU'LL

05:00:19.468 --> 05:00:23.538
CONTINUE TO GET ABOUT SAY SEVEN

05:00:23.605 --> 05:00:24.039
TO EIGHT HUNDRED I MEAN

05:00:24.106 --> 05:00:25.440
APPROXIMATELY. STUDENTS ARE

05:00:25.507 --> 05:00:28.410
GOING TO CONTINUE TO RURAL IN.

05:00:28.477 --> 05:00:31.213
IN- IT IS THROUGH THE ROOF

05:00:31.279 --> 05:00:33.915
THROUGH BETWEEN DIRECTION. IS

05:00:33.982 --> 05:00:34.483
THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR

05:00:34.549 --> 05:00:36.852
THIS COMING YEAR. I WILL BE

05:00:36.918 --> 05:00:38.387
HONEST AND SAY THAT I AM

05:00:38.453 --> 05:00:41.289
RELUCTANT TO MAKE A PREDICTION

05:00:41.356 --> 05:00:43.358
BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST SO MANY

05:00:43.425 --> 05:00:45.327
THINGS IN PLAY RIGHT NOW THAT

05:00:45.394 --> 05:00:47.829
ARE UNUSUAL FOR US AS

05:00:47.896 --> 05:00:49.097
UNIVERSITY SO I WOULD I WOULD

05:00:49.164 --> 05:00:51.066
OBSERVE THAT WE INSTITUTED THIS

05:00:51.133 --> 05:00:52.267
SHORTLY BEFORE WE WERE

05:00:52.334 --> 05:00:53.935
PICKETING RIGHTS OF WE REALLY

05:00:54.002 --> 05:00:55.036
ONLY HAVE THE FALL TWENTY

05:00:55.103 --> 05:00:57.839
NINETEEN- AND THEN FALL TWENTY

05:00:57.906 --> 05:00:58.740
TWENTY WAS IN THE CURRENT

05:00:58.807 --> 05:01:00.709
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN. SO

05:01:00.776 --> 05:01:02.611
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO UNPACK

05:01:02.677 --> 05:01:04.246
WHAT WERE THE IMPACTS HOW BIG

05:01:04.312 --> 05:01:05.447
WERE THOSE IMPACTS WHAT WAS

05:01:05.514 --> 05:01:07.416
THERE A FACT BUT WE WERE

05:01:07.482 --> 05:01:10.018
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED RIGHT THAT

05:01:10.085 --> 05:01:12.254
WE SERVED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

05:01:12.320 --> 05:01:13.755
FIFTY IN THIS CASE CLOSE TO

05:01:13.822 --> 05:01:14.356
NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND NOT

05:01:14.423 --> 05:01:17.259
FIRST ROUND- AND THEN AGAIN

05:01:17.325 --> 05:01:18.460
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO WE

05:01:18.527 --> 05:01:20.061
HOPE THAT. IT'LL STAY THERE BUT

05:01:20.128 --> 05:01:21.630
IDEALLY WE'RE HOPING THAT IT

05:01:21.696 --> 05:01:23.198
COULD BE MORE OVERTIME SO WE'RE

05:01:23.265 --> 05:01:24.399
TRYING TO STUDY WHAT WOULD HELP

05:01:24.466 --> 05:01:27.002
FACILITATE STUDENTS ACCEPTING

05:01:27.068 --> 05:01:28.937
OUR OFFER OF ADMISSION THROUGH

05:01:29.004 --> 05:01:30.639
REDIRECTION. AND WE AND WE WERE

05:01:30.705 --> 05:01:31.973
VERY PLEASANTLY I'M ALL I'M

05:01:32.040 --> 05:01:32.808
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED JUST

05:01:32.874 --> 05:01:33.809
LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AS WELL

05:01:33.875 --> 05:01:35.110
BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY THAT

05:01:35.177 --> 05:01:37.212
WE WORKED OUT WITH- YOU KNOW

05:01:37.279 --> 05:01:38.914
CHANCE RIGHT AT THAT TIME. ALL

05:01:38.980 --> 05:01:40.549
RIGHT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF

05:01:40.615 --> 05:01:42.884
WHY- I MEAN THERE ARE NOT

05:01:42.951 --> 05:01:44.219
ANOTHER NUMBER CAMPUSES ARE

05:01:44.286 --> 05:01:45.253
UNDER AND ROLL BUT DO YOU KNOW

05:01:45.320 --> 05:01:47.189
WHY SAN FRANCISCO STATE IN THE

05:01:47.255 --> 05:01:48.223
MINGUS HILLS HAVE KIND OF SEEN

05:01:48.290 --> 05:01:51.993
THE. MOST INTEREST IN TERMS OF

05:01:52.060 --> 05:01:54.362
REDIRECTION. SO I THINK IT'S A-

05:01:54.429 --> 05:01:56.498
TO. THAT- THE REDIRECTION DATA

05:01:56.565 --> 05:01:58.333
WAS IN BALANCE SO YOU HAD A

05:01:58.400 --> 05:02:00.936
SMALL NUMBER OF CSU CAMPUSES

05:02:01.002 --> 05:02:02.938
THAT WERE THE PRIMARY CENTERS.

05:02:03.004 --> 05:02:04.906
OF STUDENTS FOR REDIRECTION

05:02:04.973 --> 05:02:06.341
RIGHT AND THEN THERE ON

05:02:06.408 --> 05:02:08.009
IMPACTED CAMPUSES WHO WERE

05:02:08.076 --> 05:02:09.811
RECEIVERS. AND WE LEARNED AN

05:02:09.878 --> 05:02:11.246
IMPORTANT LESSON IN THIS AND I

05:02:11.313 --> 05:02:12.280
THINK I SHARED EARLIER THIS

05:02:12.347 --> 05:02:14.349
MORNING. IS THAT IN THE END

05:02:14.416 --> 05:02:16.218
STUDENTS ARE STILL APPLYING TO

05:02:16.284 --> 05:02:17.986
A PARTICULAR CAMPUS FOR ITS

05:02:18.053 --> 05:02:19.955
BRAND FOR ITS DISTINCTIVENESS

05:02:20.021 --> 05:02:21.323
FOR ITS NICHE. FOR THE

05:02:21.389 --> 05:02:22.257
PARTICULAR CLIMATE OR

05:02:22.324 --> 05:02:23.859
EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING

05:02:23.925 --> 05:02:25.694
FOR AND OFTENTIMES LOCATION IS

05:02:25.760 --> 05:02:27.896
GOING TO BE A KEY. AND I WILL

05:02:27.963 --> 05:02:30.131
JUST FRIENDLY OBSERVE THAT THE

05:02:30.198 --> 05:02:32.300
LARGER SENDING CAMPUSES ARE IN

05:02:32.367 --> 05:02:33.768
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION

05:02:33.835 --> 05:02:35.971
RIGHT STEP. BACK FOR SOME

05:02:36.037 --> 05:02:38.206
STUDENTS CONSIDERING AN OFFER

05:02:38.273 --> 05:02:39.741
TO ATTEND A SCHOOL THAT IS IN

05:02:39.808 --> 05:02:41.543
ANOTHER REGION WAS A BIT

05:02:41.610 --> 05:02:43.979
PROHIBITIVE. SO I DO THINK WE

05:02:44.045 --> 05:02:45.580
ATTRIBUTE THAT BOTH SAN

05:02:45.647 --> 05:02:47.148
FRANCISCO AND DOMINGUEZ HILLS

05:02:47.215 --> 05:02:48.583
HAD HIGHER NUMBERS. IN PART

05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:49.184
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

05:02:49.251 --> 05:02:51.820
METROPOLITANAREAS SO ACCESS

05:02:51.887 --> 05:02:54.456
WAS. A FACTOR. AND THEN THOSE

05:02:54.523 --> 05:02:56.091
ARE THE TWO CAMPUSES THAT WERE

05:02:56.157 --> 05:02:57.526
AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT TELLS IS

05:02:57.592 --> 05:02:58.560
THE ONLY ONE RIGHT NOW WHO'S

05:02:58.627 --> 05:02:59.995
NOT IMPACTED IN THE SO CAL

05:03:00.061 --> 05:03:01.429
REGION. GOT IT SO THAT MAKES

05:03:01.496 --> 05:03:02.998
SENSE TO BASICALLY YEAH YOU

05:03:03.064 --> 05:03:04.099
KNOW IF YOU APPLY TO FULLER

05:03:04.165 --> 05:03:05.300
TENDED YOU PLAN TO LONG BEACH

05:03:05.367 --> 05:03:06.735
STATE AND COULDN'T GET INTO

05:03:06.801 --> 05:03:09.471
THOSE PLACES BUT- EXACTLY YOU

05:03:09.538 --> 05:03:11.206
KNOW YOU CAN TAKE A DIFFERENT

05:03:11.273 --> 05:03:12.541
FREEWAY GO TO DOMINGUEZ HILLS.

05:03:12.607 --> 05:03:14.009
SO THAT'S RIGHT NOT THAT MAKES

05:03:14.075 --> 05:03:18.680
A LOT OF SENSE NO WRITTEN. WE

05:03:18.747 --> 05:03:19.314
REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK THE-

05:03:19.381 --> 05:03:20.415
THE SYSTEM JUST. TO WORK WITH

05:03:20.482 --> 05:03:23.118
US AND WE WANT. THE POLICY THEN-

05:03:23.184 --> 05:03:24.119
WE THOUGHT WE WERE JUST VERY

05:03:24.185 --> 05:03:25.620
PLEASED ABOUT THE SMOOTH

05:03:25.687 --> 05:03:27.188
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY SO

05:03:27.255 --> 05:03:28.557
I JUST WANTED TO JUST. IN

05:03:28.623 --> 05:03:30.191
PARTICULAR JUST CAN THANK

05:03:30.258 --> 05:03:31.226
FORMER CHANCELLOR WHITE AND

05:03:31.293 --> 05:03:32.794
OBVIOUSLY A CHANCE ACOSTA BUT

05:03:32.861 --> 05:03:34.429
ALL BUT ALL THE ALL THE TEAM

05:03:34.496 --> 05:03:35.130
DOWN IN LONG BEACH FOR REALLY

05:03:35.196 --> 05:03:36.898
MAKING THAT HAPPEN. I'M IN

05:03:36.965 --> 05:03:39.634
TERMS OF ENROLLMENT I KNOW THAT

05:03:39.701 --> 05:03:40.569
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING

05:03:40.635 --> 05:03:43.138
TO SEE. A DIP IN APPLICATIONS

05:03:43.204 --> 05:03:44.706
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE ENROLLMENT AT

05:03:44.773 --> 05:03:47.876
LEAST SLIGHTLY INCREASED IN

05:03:47.943 --> 05:03:48.510
TWENTY TWENTY DO YOU ANTICIPATE

05:03:48.577 --> 05:03:50.345
THAT A WOMAN WILL KEEP KEEP

05:03:50.412 --> 05:03:51.146
GOING UP ARE YOU CONCERNED

05:03:51.212 --> 05:03:52.681
BECAUSE OF THE- THE DIFFERENT

05:03:52.747 --> 05:03:55.984
APPLICATIONS ATTACK COULD

05:03:56.051 --> 05:03:56.818
RESULT IN LOWER ENROLLMENT.

05:03:56.885 --> 05:03:58.653
OKAY SO I CAN'T THIS A PLACE

05:03:58.720 --> 05:04:00.322
WHERE YOU KNOW THE ARE AND

05:04:00.388 --> 05:04:01.456
SCIENCE OF ENROLLMENT

05:04:01.523 --> 05:04:03.558
PROJECTIONS IS ALWAYS BASED ON

05:04:03.625 --> 05:04:05.193
PAST PATTERNS OF STUDENT

05:04:05.260 --> 05:04:07.228
BEHAVIOR. AND GIVEN THAT ALL OF

05:04:07.295 --> 05:04:08.363
THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN

05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:10.932
DISRUPTED. OUR ABILITY OUR

05:04:10.999 --> 05:04:14.336
EIGHT BALL IS BROKEN. TO LOOK

05:04:14.402 --> 05:04:15.637
AT IT SO WE WERE CERTAINLY

05:04:15.704 --> 05:04:17.405
PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR ROMANCE

05:04:17.472 --> 05:04:18.807
UNLIKE OTHER SIMILAR

05:04:18.873 --> 05:04:20.241
INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE U. S.

05:04:20.308 --> 05:04:22.410
DID NOT TAKE A DIP THIS PAST

05:04:22.477 --> 05:04:24.879
FALL. AND I THINK AN EARLIER

05:04:24.946 --> 05:04:26.982
REPORTED AND RIGHT NOW AS OF

05:04:27.048 --> 05:04:29.351
EARLY MARCH OUR APPLICATIONS

05:04:29.417 --> 05:04:31.052
FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE

05:04:31.119 --> 05:04:33.755
ONLY 3% BELOW THE PRIOR YEAR.

05:04:33.822 --> 05:04:35.557
SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT

05:04:35.624 --> 05:04:37.058
APPLICATIONS ARE NOT ENROLLMENT

05:04:37.125 --> 05:04:38.994
APPLICATION IS JUST WHAT WE

05:04:39.060 --> 05:04:40.729
CALL THE BEGINNING OF THE TOTAL

05:04:40.795 --> 05:04:42.597
ENROLLMENT FINAL IT'S THE START

05:04:42.664 --> 05:04:44.032
OF A STUDENT'S JOURNEY TO

05:04:44.099 --> 05:04:46.334
POSSIBLY ENROLL WITH THE CSU SO

05:04:46.401 --> 05:04:48.370
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING

05:04:48.436 --> 05:04:49.838
SURE THAT WE CAN ADMIT ALL OF

05:04:49.904 --> 05:04:51.840
OUR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AND

05:04:51.906 --> 05:04:53.608
HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO

05:04:53.675 --> 05:04:55.777
ENROLL SO THAT WE CAN EMPHASIZE

05:04:55.844 --> 05:04:57.712
HOW MORE THAN EVER NOW IT'S

05:04:57.779 --> 05:04:59.314
IMPORTANT TO GET A HIGHER

05:04:59.381 --> 05:05:01.082
EDUCATION CREDENTIAL SO THAT

05:05:01.149 --> 05:05:02.384
YOU CAN BUY FOR YOURSELVES

05:05:02.450 --> 05:05:04.552
AGAINST THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF

05:05:04.619 --> 05:05:06.087
THIS FINANCIAL TURMOIL. SO

05:05:06.154 --> 05:05:07.489
WE'LL SEE WE CERTAINLY HOPE WE

05:05:07.555 --> 05:05:08.757
CAN SUSTAIN AND MAINTAIN AND

05:05:08.823 --> 05:05:10.191
IMPROVE WHAT WE HOPE WE HOPE SO

05:05:10.258 --> 05:05:12.193
AS WELL. RIGHT AND THEN GOING

05:05:12.260 --> 05:05:13.728
TO THE MY LAST POINT WHICH I

05:05:13.795 --> 05:05:14.429
THINK IS OBVIOUSLY THE MOST

05:05:14.496 --> 05:05:15.630
IMPORTANT THING WHICH IS.

05:05:15.697 --> 05:05:19.167
REALLY AROUND GRADUATION RATES-

05:05:19.234 --> 05:05:20.301
YOU I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE

05:05:20.368 --> 05:05:21.469
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN

05:05:21.536 --> 05:05:23.505
DEFINITELY SOME PROGRESS ON THE

05:05:23.571 --> 05:05:25.940
SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE- SOME

05:05:26.007 --> 05:05:27.409
NOT AS MUCH PROGRESS ON THE

05:05:27.475 --> 05:05:28.743
FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE I

05:05:28.810 --> 05:05:29.811
KNOW THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

05:05:29.878 --> 05:05:33.381
IS ASKING FOR. I BELIEVE- SIXTY

05:05:33.448 --> 05:05:34.916
SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR ON

05:05:34.983 --> 05:05:36.818
GOING. TO SUPPORT THE

05:05:36.885 --> 05:05:38.386
GRADUATION INITIATIVE CAN YOU

05:05:38.453 --> 05:05:40.055
JUST GIVE ME GIVE US A SENSE OF

05:05:40.121 --> 05:05:41.256
HOW THE GRADUATION ISSUES GOING

05:05:41.322 --> 05:05:43.391
AND SORT OF WHAT WE COULD KIND

05:05:43.458 --> 05:05:47.162
OF HOPE. FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR

05:05:47.228 --> 05:05:49.064
SO. WHAT BUT THIS IS FOR STORE

05:05:49.130 --> 05:05:51.666
WITH ISSUE IN THEN I'LL ASK ME

05:05:51.733 --> 05:05:52.300
TO EVANS TO TALK ABOUT THE

05:05:52.367 --> 05:05:54.202
PERSON. AND MOST OF THINGS

05:05:54.269 --> 05:05:57.605
GREATNESS. SO- SOME TEAM- WE-

05:05:57.672 --> 05:05:59.307
FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY SIX

05:05:59.374 --> 05:06:01.810
MILLION IS ON TOP OF THE ONE

05:06:01.876 --> 05:06:02.477
HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE

05:06:02.544 --> 05:06:03.411
MILLION THE GOVERNOR HAS

05:06:03.478 --> 05:06:06.081

THAT WILL DO IS THAT SIXTY SIX

05:06:07.982 --> 05:06:09.284
MILLION ABOVE THAT AMOUNT.

MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL- I WOULD

05:11:52.593 --> 05:11:53.761
BEGIN BY SHARING FOR NUMBER OF

05:11:53.828 --> 05:11:56.030
YEARS THE CSU HAS MAINTAINED

05:11:56.097 --> 05:11:57.965
CENTRAL NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS.

05:11:58.032 --> 05:11:59.200
FOR LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

05:11:59.267 --> 05:12:00.668
THAT ARE LEVERAGING THE SIZE

05:12:00.735 --> 05:12:01.669
AND SCOPE OF OUR UNIVERSITY

05:12:01.736 --> 05:12:03.204
SYSTEM FOR VERY FAVORABLE

05:12:03.271 --> 05:12:05.807
PRICING- AND IS NOTED IN

05:12:05.873 --> 05:12:07.175
TODAY'S AGENDA FOURTEEN CSU

05:12:07.241 --> 05:12:08.976
CAMPUSES HAVE GRAVITATED TOWARD

05:12:09.043 --> 05:12:10.611
ONE SYSTEM WITH THE REMAINING

05:12:10.678 --> 05:12:11.412
NINE CAMPUSES ON OTHER

05:12:11.479 --> 05:12:13.514
PLATFORMS I SEVERAL OF THOSE

05:12:13.581 --> 05:12:14.949
REMAINING NINE HAVE EXPRESSED

05:12:15.016 --> 05:12:16.350
INTEREST IN MOVING TO A MORE

05:12:16.417 --> 05:12:17.885
UBIQUITOUS PLATFORM IN THE

05:12:17.952 --> 05:12:18.719
RESOURCES COULD CERTAINLY HELP

05:12:18.786 --> 05:12:20.488
FACILITATE. BUT THEY MAY NOT BE

05:12:20.555 --> 05:12:22.123
SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL

05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:24.392
ASSOCIATED COSTS WE WOULD ADD A

05:12:24.459 --> 05:12:26.461
COUPLE CAUTIONS- THAT WE HAVE

05:12:26.527 --> 05:12:28.262
NOTED IN OTHER CONVERSATIONS

05:12:28.329 --> 05:12:29.730
THAT SUCH AN ACTION COULD

05:12:29.797 --> 05:12:31.199
HINDER THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING

05:12:31.265 --> 05:12:33.401
PROCESS FOR TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO

05:12:33.468 --> 05:12:34.702
GIVEN RAPID CHANGES IN

05:12:34.769 --> 05:12:36.537
TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS WE WOULD

05:12:36.604 --> 05:12:38.072
ALSO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

05:12:38.139 --> 05:12:39.373
POTENTIALLY CODIFYING A

05:12:39.440 --> 05:12:41.409
PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR VENDOR-

05:12:41.476 --> 05:12:43.911
IN ANYACTION- NEXT ON THE

05:12:43.978 --> 05:12:45.713
COMPUTING TALENT INITIATIVE-

05:12:45.780 --> 05:12:47.615
WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY LOOK TO

05:12:47.682 --> 05:12:49.684
IMPROVE. OUR GRADUATION RATE

05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:50.685
FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO

05:12:50.751 --> 05:12:52.120
ENTERED AND AS I REFERENCED A

05:12:52.186 --> 05:12:53.421
FEW MINUTES AGO OR JUST ONE

05:12:53.488 --> 05:12:55.223
PERCENTAGE POINT AWAY FROM ONE

05:12:55.289 --> 05:12:56.757
OF OUR TRANSFER GOALS AND THAT

05:12:56.824 --> 05:12:58.626
WOULD BE FIVE YEARS EARLY AND

05:12:58.693 --> 05:13:00.628
IT'S BEEN ACHIEVED THUS FAR BY

05:13:00.695 --> 05:13:02.530
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS ON MANY CSU

05:13:02.597 --> 05:13:03.764
CAMPUSES IN THE COMPUTING

05:13:03.831 --> 05:13:05.566
TALENT INITIATIVE. IS JUST ONE

05:13:05.633 --> 05:13:07.301
OF THESE- AND SO THE US WE

05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:08.569
WOULD PREFER TO SEE INVESTMENT

05:13:08.636 --> 05:13:10.805
IN- IN THE TRUSTEES PRIORITIES

05:13:10.872 --> 05:13:12.840
AROUND GRADUATION INITIATIVE

05:13:12.907 --> 05:13:14.175
AND MORE BROUGHT MORE BROAD

05:13:14.242 --> 05:13:16.077
EFFORTS AND ADDITIONALLY THE

05:13:16.144 --> 05:13:17.478
MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL WOULD

05:13:17.545 --> 05:13:19.080
PROVIDE PROVIDE SOME ONE TIME

05:13:19.147 --> 05:13:20.681
FUNDING TO EXPAND THE COMPUTING

05:13:20.748 --> 05:13:21.716
TALENT INITIATIVE TO OTHER

05:13:21.782 --> 05:13:23.918
CAMPUSES WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

05:13:23.985 --> 05:13:25.720
ONE TIME FUNDING- DOES CREATE

05:13:25.786 --> 05:13:29.157
AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE START A

05:13:29.223 --> 05:13:29.790
PROGRAM AND THEN POTENTIALLY HE

05:13:29.857 --> 05:13:30.591
STARTED. ON A RESEARCH ON OTHER

05:13:30.658 --> 05:13:31.993
KEY. IF WE TRY TO START THAT UP

05:13:32.059 --> 05:13:33.828
SO I THINK OUR PRIORITY AGAIN

05:13:33.895 --> 05:13:36.164
WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON. THE

05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:38.599
TRUSTEES ADOPTED BUDGET. AND

05:13:38.666 --> 05:13:39.567
THEN LASTLY AROUND PROFESSIONAL

05:13:39.634 --> 05:13:41.536
DEVELOPMENT PROMOTING INCLUSIVE

05:13:41.602 --> 05:13:42.670
EQUITY BY TEACHING AND

05:13:42.737 --> 05:13:44.472
CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN

05:13:44.539 --> 05:13:45.540
A PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR

05:13:45.606 --> 05:13:46.440
PROFESSIONAL TO THIS

05:13:46.507 --> 05:13:48.643
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM WIDE- IN

05:13:48.709 --> 05:13:50.645
RECENT YEARS. AND THE ONSET OF

05:13:50.711 --> 05:13:56.651
THE. PANDEMIC REALLY AMPLIFIED

05:13:56.717 --> 05:13:57.285
THE AWARENESS OF ECO IN. AND WE

05:13:57.351 --> 05:13:57.919
SAW A TREE. RESPONSE BUYER FACT

05:13:57.985 --> 05:13:59.353
IN. IN A PROFESSIONAL

05:13:59.420 --> 05:14:01.222
DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY AROUND

05:14:01.289 --> 05:14:03.324
THAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF

05:14:03.391 --> 05:14:05.092
HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND DEEPER

05:14:05.159 --> 05:14:06.727
CONCERNS ABOUT EVERY ASPECT OF

INSTRUCTION FROM COURSE CONTENT

05:14:08.729 --> 05:14:10.364
TO LEARNING ACTIVITIES. SO THIS

05:14:10.431 --> 05:14:11.532
RESOURCE COULD CERTAINLY

05:14:11.599 --> 05:14:11.966
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

DEVELOPMENT IN THESE ARENAS-

05:14:15.236 --> 05:14:16.370
AND WE ALSO THINK IT WILL HELP

05:14:16.437 --> 05:14:17.705
TRANSLATE BACK AS WE BEGIN TO

05:14:17.772 --> 05:14:19.674

05:15:07.655 --> 05:15:08.889
SIX PILLARS THAT THE CSU WAS

05:15:08.956 --> 05:15:10.358
IDENTIFIED TO ADVANCE OUR

05:15:10.424 --> 05:15:13.060

ACROSS OUR TWENTY THREE

CAMPUSES. THIS IS PREMISED ON

05:15:21.068 --> 05:15:22.403
THE PRINCIPLE THAT STUDENTS

FINANCIAL AID SUPPORT THAT IS

05:15:33.080 --> 05:15:34.749
RESPONSIVE TO THEIR SHIFTING

REALITIES WHETHER SHORT OR LONG

05:15:36.984 --> 05:15:38.619

SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE

05:24:03.957 --> 05:24:04.925
GENERAL FUND AND FIND OTHER. TO

05:24:04.992 --> 05:24:09.830
UP TO FIND THAT PIECE REFORM. I

05:24:09.897 --> 05:24:15.836
CAN'T HEAR YOU. SORRY I MUSED

05:24:15.903 --> 05:24:19.039
ASSUMES DIFFERENT FEEDBACK- SO

05:24:19.106 --> 05:24:20.874
I DID I WANT TO FIRST START BY

05:24:20.941 --> 05:24:24.011
REITERATING THAT WE SEE MANY

05:24:24.077 --> 05:24:26.513
MERITS TO THIS PROPOSAL. R. FOR

05:24:26.580 --> 05:24:28.315
ALL THE REASONS THAT I CITED SO

05:24:28.382 --> 05:24:30.317
I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THE

05:24:30.384 --> 05:24:32.753
SECOND PIECE IS THAT WE JUST

05:24:32.820 --> 05:24:35.222
ARE SIMPLY NOT SURE SO FOR

05:24:35.289 --> 05:24:36.690
EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE INCREASED

05:24:36.757 --> 05:24:39.359
ACCESS IN THE INITIAL- SHORT

05:24:39.426 --> 05:24:41.094
TERM YEARS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

05:24:41.161 --> 05:24:43.297
LOOK AT LONGER TERM WHAT WILL

05:24:43.363 --> 05:24:44.932
HAPPEN. AND THERE'S SO MANY

05:24:44.998 --> 05:24:46.834
MOVING PARTS RIGHT THIS IS NOT

05:24:46.900 --> 05:24:48.802
A SIMPLE DIRECT LINEAR FORMULA

05:24:48.869 --> 05:24:50.804
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THERE

05:24:50.871 --> 05:24:52.873
ARE BOTH WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL

05:24:52.940 --> 05:24:55.108
HAVE STUDENTS ARE INCREASE

05:24:55.175 --> 05:24:58.178
ACCESS. TO GRANT AID TO SUPPORT

05:24:58.245 --> 05:25:00.547
TUITION AND FEES BUT THEY'RE

05:25:00.614 --> 05:25:02.082
ALSO POTENTIALLY SOME STUDENTS

05:25:02.149 --> 05:25:03.951
WHO AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW

05:25:04.017 --> 05:25:07.487
FORMULA WON'T RECEIVE THE SAME

05:25:07.554 --> 05:25:09.223
AMOUNT OR RECEIVE LESS. THE

05:25:09.289 --> 05:25:11.158
OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT IS

05:25:11.225 --> 05:25:12.392
COMPLICATED I THINK FOR US

05:25:12.459 --> 05:25:14.528
WE'RE MODELING WOULD BENEFIT IS

05:25:14.595 --> 05:25:16.930
THIS INTERFACE WITH THE COST OF

05:25:16.997 --> 05:25:18.832
ATTENDANCE SO WE BEGAN THIS

05:25:18.899 --> 05:25:20.467
ENDEAVOR IN PERFORMING CAL

05:25:20.534 --> 05:25:22.636
GRANTS. BY TRYING TO CONSIDER A

05:25:22.703 --> 05:25:24.738
MODEL THAT THE STATE BASED AID

05:25:24.805 --> 05:25:26.773
PROGRAM WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

05:25:26.840 --> 05:25:28.242
ALL THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AND

05:25:28.308 --> 05:25:29.142
WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE

05:25:29.209 --> 05:25:30.711
CURRENT FINANCIAL VARMA IT'S

05:25:30.777 --> 05:25:32.746
IMPOSSIBLE TO ENGAGE AND CHANGE

05:25:32.813 --> 05:25:34.681
THAT IS THAT SIGNIFICANT IN ONE

05:25:34.748 --> 05:25:37.484
FELL SWOOP. BUT WITH THAT SAID

05:25:37.551 --> 05:25:39.052
THAT MEANS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

05:25:39.119 --> 05:25:40.988
TRULY PACKAGE WITH THE

05:25:41.054 --> 05:25:42.623
CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THE

05:25:42.689 --> 05:25:43.957
ADDITIONAL COST OF ATTENDANCE

05:25:44.024 --> 05:25:45.993
BEYOND TO REGION AND FEES WE

05:25:46.059 --> 05:25:47.527
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW MANY

05:25:47.594 --> 05:25:49.630
STUDENTS. ARE WE WOULD BE

05:25:49.696 --> 05:25:51.331
LOOKING TO HAVE TO PACKAGE AND

05:25:51.398 --> 05:25:52.733
PROVIDE THOSE ADDITIONAL A

05:25:52.799 --> 05:25:54.001
GRANTS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO

05:25:54.067 --> 05:25:55.535
AS WE RECOGNIZE HALF OF OUR

05:25:55.602 --> 05:25:56.803
STUDENTS COME FROM THE

05:25:56.870 --> 05:25:59.006
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DON'T

05:25:59.072 --> 05:26:00.007
WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

05:26:00.073 --> 05:26:02.276
STUDENTS. EIGHT PACKAGING IS

05:26:02.342 --> 05:26:04.077
POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR

05:26:04.144 --> 05:26:05.879
PATHWAY TO THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE

05:26:05.946 --> 05:26:07.848
SO RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT MODEL

05:26:07.915 --> 05:26:09.082
IS TWO TIERED AND IT'S

05:26:09.149 --> 05:26:10.450
DEPENDENT AWARE YOU ARE

05:26:10.517 --> 05:26:12.920
ENROLLED. AS OPPOSED TO THAT

05:26:12.986 --> 05:26:14.688
THE STUDENT THEMSELVES IN TERMS

05:26:14.755 --> 05:26:16.823
OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION SO

05:26:16.890 --> 05:26:17.991
THAT MEANS FOR EXAMPLE A

05:26:18.058 --> 05:26:18.992
STUDENT RIGHT NOW ON A

05:26:19.059 --> 05:26:21.628
COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECEIVES. A

05:26:21.695 --> 05:26:23.797
GRANT IN AID TO SUPPORT COST OF

05:26:23.864 --> 05:26:25.198
ATTENDANCE ABOVE TUITION AND

05:26:25.265 --> 05:26:27.534
FEES I THINK TO BE ABLE TO

05:26:27.601 --> 05:26:29.303
SUPPORT CONTINUATION FOR THAT

05:26:29.369 --> 05:26:31.104
STUDENT WHEN THEY TRANSFER TO

05:26:31.171 --> 05:26:32.906
THE CSU THAT AT A MINIMUM WE

05:26:32.973 --> 05:26:34.975
WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE THAT.

05:26:35.042 --> 05:26:37.077
ARE COMPARABLE LEVEL. AND

05:26:37.144 --> 05:26:38.679
ACCOUNTING FOR ANY CHANGES IN

05:26:38.745 --> 05:26:40.747
THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION. OKAY

05:26:40.814 --> 05:26:44.751
THANK YOU PEAK. YES GOOD THE

05:26:44.818 --> 05:26:46.553
THIRD YEAH- PIECE I THINK IT'S

05:26:46.620 --> 05:26:47.321
JUST RECORD THAT WE HAVE

05:26:47.387 --> 05:26:48.956
ANOTHER MOVING PART WHICH IS

05:26:49.022 --> 05:26:51.191
THE PELL GRANT. AND SO WE HAVE

05:26:51.258 --> 05:26:52.626
DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY RIGHT THE

05:26:52.693 --> 05:26:54.027
PELL GRANT IS AVAILABLE FOR SIX

05:26:54.094 --> 05:26:55.829
YEARS AVAILABILITY TO SEE

05:26:55.896 --> 05:26:57.431
SECOND TOTAL RIGHT BETWEEN C.

05:26:57.497 --> 05:26:59.266
SACK TO CAL GRANT TO AND CAL

05:26:59.333 --> 05:27:01.168
GRANT FOR. ITS FOUR YEARS SO

05:27:01.234 --> 05:27:02.669
WE'RE INTERESTED BECAUSE A

05:27:02.736 --> 05:27:03.971
NOTABLE NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS

05:27:04.037 --> 05:27:05.472
ARE GOING TO TAKE FIVE OR SIX

05:27:05.539 --> 05:27:07.274
YEARS TO GRADUATE WHAT WILL

05:27:07.341 --> 05:27:09.376
THAT ADDITIONAL ONE OR TWO

05:27:09.443 --> 05:27:11.311
YEARS. LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF

05:27:11.378 --> 05:27:13.180
RECALIBRATION OF HOW WE ARE

05:27:13.246 --> 05:27:15.582
WARNING AID TO AGAIN MINIMIZE

05:27:15.649 --> 05:27:17.017
DISRUPTION TO THE STUDENTS

05:27:17.084 --> 05:27:18.885
PATHWAY 2 DEGREES SO WE JUST

05:27:18.952 --> 05:27:20.721
HAVE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK CAN

05:27:20.787 --> 05:27:23.123
BE ANSWERED. WITH MODELING AND

05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:24.958
A CLEAR SET OF ASSUMPTIONS OF

05:27:25.025 --> 05:27:27.294
WHAT WE ALL BELIEVE WE'RE GOING

05:27:27.361 --> 05:27:30.931

SYSTEM AND THIS IS A MULTI YEAR

05:27:37.104 --> 05:27:39.673
EFFORT BUT- A FEW THINGS- ONE

COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

05:27:41.908 --> 05:27:43.477
