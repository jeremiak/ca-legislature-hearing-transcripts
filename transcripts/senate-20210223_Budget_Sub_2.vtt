00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.528
I BUT THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.263
ABOUT WHY THIS CATEGORY COULD

WORKING WITH OUR BANK FOR

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.089

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.497
PROBABLY ENDORSE. I THINK

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.399
THAT'S ANY- EXAMPLE OF KEYBOARD.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.901

LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.736
SAID THAT WE WILL FUND IS FROM

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.605
NON STATE. FUNDS NON

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.140
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS THAT WAS THE

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.509
DEAL. THAT WAS MADE. NOW SIX

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.411
MONTHS LATER. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.745
COMING BACK WITH NOT ONLY

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.781
FUNDING IT WOULD STAY FUNDS. A

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:43.115
BUT FINDING IT CONTINUOUSLY

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.918
WITH STATE FUNDS B. AND THEN

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.120
EARLY ACTION SO IT'S- I GUESS

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:50.189
THE QUESTION WILL BE ASKED IS.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.657
IS WHAT GOOD DID THE DECISIONS

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:52.858
THAT WE MAKE AT THE END OF THE

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.927
YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHEN.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.529
THE LESSONS A HALF A YEAR LATER

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:57.463
WE'RE COMING BACK WITH THE

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.166
ENTIRE THE ENTIRELY OPPOSITE.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.968
AND PUT ASIDE. THE VALUE OF A

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:03.269
GREEN BANK AND ALL THAT CAMPUS

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:05.137
OF JUST A REGULAR. THE

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.172
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:11.844
LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:12.578
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. SURE I

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.013
CAN GIVE YOU. OF MY PERSPECTIVE

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.114
THAT IN THE COURSE OF. WHAT WAS

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.882
A FAIRLY EASY TO GO. PREVIOUS

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:17.783
EIGHT LAST YEAR WHICH MEANT

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.018
THAT. WAS AIMED AT SETTING A

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.653
FRAMEWORK AND DISSIPATING BUT

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.022
FEDERAL STIMULUS IN THE NEAR

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.490
TERM. WE NEED TO SET THIS ONE

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.359
UP TO RECEIVE. THOSE DOLLARS.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.860
THE DESIGN OF THE LANGUAGE

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.328
DESIGN IF YOU LIKE LANDED ON

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.097
FEDERAL ONLY. AND IN MY

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.465
JUDGMENT WENT TOO FAR IN

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.100
PRECLUDING FOR ALL TIME THAT

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:34.967
THE POSSIBILITY OF STATE

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.103
ALLOCATION TO SUPPLEMENT. THOSE

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:39.505
FEDERAL DOLLARS. BOB SO IT WAS

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:40.639
DEFINITELY THE NEGOTIATION BUT

00:10:40.706 --> 00:10:42.775
I THINK IT WAS. AN OVERSTAFFED

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:43.809
AND THIS IS A CHANCE TO

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.511
RECONSIDER THAT AND SAY AND IN

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.213
SPECIFIC LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.581
WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO PUT

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:49.415
STATE DOLLARS WELL INTO THIS

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.050
ONCE ABOUT THAT IS THERE. THE

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.685
REQUESTED HE LIKE TO RECONSIDER

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.186
THAT A TERMINATION WHICH IN MY

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.422
JUDGMENT WAS MADE A LITTLE BIT

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.490
HASTILY AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.291
THIS PHARMACY. APPROPRIATION OR

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.693
CONTINUOUS FLOWING FUNDS. IT'S

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.428
A ONE TIME ALLOCATION. WITHOUT

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.763
ASKING AT THIS STAGE FOR

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.866
FURTHER ALLOCATIONS FOR THE

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:07.600
SECTOR. THE BEAUTY OF THE ROBOT

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.402
FUND IS THEY WANT MONEY IS THE-

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.770
TO THE- EN ROUTE BE READ. BUT

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.005
THERE'S NO CONTINUOUS. FROM THE

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.608
GENERAL FUND. IN THIS CASE- AND

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:16.942
THEN LASTLY FOR THE URGENCY

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.378
MEASURE DATA. WANTED TO THE

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.846
FORCE PRIVATE SECTOR. IS REALLY

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:22.548
RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF YOU

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.183
USE THIS FOR SPEECH ACT MORE

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.152
AGGRESSIVELY. FREE MARKETS TO

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:28.187
DRAWDOWN OF THE WILDFIRE RISK

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:28.754
IT HAS A CHANCE TO DO SOME

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:30.022
EARLY ACTION TO DECREASE

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.357
WILDFIRE RISK IS NOT GONNA

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:32.658
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COURSE.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.926
BUT IT IS URGENT AND SO I THINK

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.261
THAT'S WHY IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR

00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:36.762
EARLY ACTION BUDGET ITEM FOR

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:37.863
HORSE THE PRESS ALWAYS JUMP

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.932
JUMP INTO THE WILDFIRE. PORTION

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:45.938
OF DEATH THE GROUP IS- A ONE

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:48.774

WITH DAN EXPRESS THAT WAY AND-

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.387
THE I'M CAL'S FONG WAS SET UP

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.722
LAST BUDGET CYCLE. HE WAS IN

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:07.159
LIGHT OF THE PENDING AND- STILL

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:08.360
THERE WERE WORK ONE IN THEIR

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:09.762
WAY THROUGH BOTH THE U. S.

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.764
SENATE AND U. S. HOUSE WE WERE

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.966
ALL HOPEFUL THAT THOSE ONE OF

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:15.134
THOSE GOALS WE GET PAST THAT

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.103
WOULD PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR THE

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.004
CLIMBING HILLS FINE. AS WELL

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:21.006
WHERE NONE OF THEM HAD PASSED

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.541
IN THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.610
BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY AT THE

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.445
TABLE AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:27.847
GOING TO THE HOUSE FOR A VOTE

PERSPECTIVE FINDING THE

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.164
CHEAPEST SIMILAR GOALS AND

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.133
THEREBY NECESSITATING THIS SET

WE NOTED IT COULD BE AN

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.052
APPROPRIATE WAY TO INCREASE THE

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.354

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:54.967
NOTED WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:59.004
LIST OF. HIGH PRIORITY- ITEMS-

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.773
IDENTIFIED BY THE STRATEGIC

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.075
PRESS COUNCIL BUT- HE HAS

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.311
EXPLAINED- THIS MORNING-

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.947
WIDEOUT WHY THAT CAME ABOUT-

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.381
REGARDING THE CONCERNS YOU

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:11.517
RAISED- YES THE LEGISLATURE DID

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:15.921
NOT INCLUDE- INCLUDED LANGUAGE

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.189
THAT NO STATE FUNDS WERE TO BE

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.625
USED FOR THE FUND. THE

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.293
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.629
CHANGE TO STATUTE TO ALLOW THE

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.598
PHONE TO ACCEPT STATE FUNDS SO

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.100
THIS IS- AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.902
THE LEGISLATURE TO REEVALUATE

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.538
WHETHER THEY WANT TO FUND THIS-

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:33.906
YOU PROGRAM OR NOT IF THE

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:34.974
LEGISLATURE DOES APPROVE

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.008
FUNDING FOR THE CLIMATE CATTLE

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.109
SPEND WE WOULD RECOMMEND

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.377
EXPANDING SLIGHTLY THE

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.045
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I'M TO

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:41.981
HELP YOU ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:43.482
THIS NEW PROGRAM. IS IT IS A

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:47.052
CONCERN FROM THE AUDIO ON THE-

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:48.721
MECHANISM FOR THE FUNDING YOU

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:50.289
KNOW IT'S A SEEMS LIKE THEY

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.657
THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE THAT

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.359
THERE'S THESE LOANS THAT THEY

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:54.526
CAN GET IN THE AGRICULTURAL

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:56.328
SECTOR OR SKY HIGH INTEREST

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.796
RATES AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.265
LENDING OR IS IT THE PARTICULAR

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:02.167
PROJECTS THAT BY BANKS WERE.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:05.371
FOUND TO BE AS WE WOULD CHOOSE

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:06.739
WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:09.642
IT'S MORE THE FORMER IT'S THAT-

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:12.444
ITS STATE. LOANS FOR PRIVATE

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:14.880
PROJECTS CAN BE DEPENDING ON ON

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:17.316
THE RISK IN THE- FAMILIARITY OF

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:18.817
THE MARKET WITH SERVICE

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:19.652
PROJECTS CAN BE ALL OVER THE

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:22.721
PLACE FOR- SOME PROJECTS THERE

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:23.956
MIGHT BE LOWER COST FINANCING

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.324
AVAILABLE BUT THOSE PROJECTS

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.191
MAY NOT NEED THE SORT OF

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:29.228
FUNDING AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.964
THIS FUND- DEPENDING ON THAT

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.065
THE TYPES OF PROJECTS IN THE

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:36.769
RISKINESS. IT MAY EITHER BE. IF

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:39.204
IT'S IF IT'S- IF REPLACING A

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.205
VERY HIGH INTEREST RATE LOANS

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.307
THAT PROJECT MIGHT BE RISKY AND%

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:42.641
THEN THIS THE FUND WILL NOT BE

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.143
REPAIRED AND IT CAN'T BE SELF

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:45.744
SUSTAINING AS ENVISIONED. AND

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:48.180
IF THE PROJECTS ARE. TOO SAFE

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.548
THEN THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.683
ACCESS TO PRIVATE CAPITAL THE

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.618
SPEND COULD BE SERVING TO CROWD

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:53.919
OUT SO WE'RE THIS FUND IS

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:54.820
POSITIONING ITSELF IS IN THE

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.389
MIDDLE- TO CROWD IN PRIVATE

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:00.092
CAPITAL. AND WHAT WHAT WE'RE

00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:01.527
SUGGESTING IS THAT IT WOULD BE

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:02.661
GOOD TO START WITH A SMALLER

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.130
PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS- LAST

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.332
LECTURES PROGRAM HAVE MUCH

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:10.769
BROADER. SCOPE SO- SO IF YOU

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.705
PRACTICE YOU CAN- HOPEFULLY

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:14.440
COLLECT DATA TO SEE THAT THE

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.774
PROJECTS BEING FUNDED ARE IN

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:16.775
THAT SWEET SPOT AND THAT WE ARE

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:18.577
CROWDING OUT PRIVATE CAPITAL OR

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.845
TAKING ON TOO MUCH RISK

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:24.550
EXCELLENT ADVICE- CHAIR DOLLY.

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.285
AND THEN CENTER STERN. THE YOU

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:29.288
MR CHAIRMAN I MY FIRST. IS WHAT

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.289
WHAT ARE THE FEDS BRINGING TO

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.590
THE TABLE WHAT WHAT I MEAN IN

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.958
THE LEGISLATION I I'M NOT SEEN

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.227
OUT IS IT JUST DOLLARS FOR THE

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:40.232
POLICY. AT THIS STAGE OF ITS

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.700
BEING SHAPED AND DESCRIBED AS

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.501
THE CLEAN ENERGY AND

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.403
SUSTAINABILITY ACCELERATOR

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.404
WHICH REALLY HAS TWO

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.139
COMPONENTS. WELL NUMBER ONE

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.540
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DOLLAR

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.109
FIGURE SO CORONER DEUCE IN BOTH

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.143
CHAMBERS AND THAT'S NOW

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.511
PARTISAN SUPPORT. HUNDRED

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:54.313
BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.681
CRITICAL CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.316
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OF

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.151
BY AND I WAS NEWLY ESTABLISHED

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:00.452
INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT GREEN

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.354
BACK. BUT THE BULK OF THE WORK

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.889
WILL BE TO FLOW CAPITAL TO STAY

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.425
GREEN BACKS- IN A RANGE OF

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:07.659
CATEGORIES WHICH BROADLY

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:08.861
REFLECT THE STATE'S GOING TO

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.629
PRIORITIES AND STOPPING PLAN

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.698
ELSEWHERE- GET INTO A IN A LOW

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.032
COST REVOLVING LOAN PURCHASES

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.267
SUCH AS THE ONE PRESCRIBING

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.502
HERE. THERE'S A COMPONENT OF

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:18.570
POLICY PRESCRIPTION THAT 40% OF

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:19.772
THE CAPITAL TREAT UNDERSERVED

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.774
MARKETS AND DRIVE INCLUSION BUT

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.875
BEYOND THAT IT'S NOT

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.410
STIPULATING POLICY GOALS FOR

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:25.944
THE CLIMATE SECTOR OTHER THAN

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:31.483
WHAT IS ALREADY. IN THE

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.618
INDIVIDUAL STATE LAWS. HE SAID

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:34.987
HUNDRED BILL. UNDER BILL TOTAL.

00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:35.554
THIS WOULD BE TO WHAT WOULD

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.155
CONSIDERED CRITICAL NATIONAL

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.322
INFRASTRUCTURE THINK ABOUT

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.726
LARGE SCALE TRANSMISSION. TEXAS

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:41.693
VERSUS WHAT CLOSE TO THE

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.562
STATE'S RETURN. I'LL THAT HAS

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.130
NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET THAT'S

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:47.399
THE TOP LINE NUMBER. SO I

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:48.767
NOTICED THAT COMMENTS THANK YOU

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:50.836
FOR THAT INFORMATION- I'M I'M

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.205
PRETTY ON BOARD WITH YOU KNOW

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.606
DOING INCENTIVES BUT HI I

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:55.974
SOMEBODY UP FOR SOME OF ARMOR

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.277
NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. I LIVE

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.445
IN THE FOREST AND IT'S BURNING

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:01.880
DOWN EVERY DAY AND THERE'S ALL

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:05.050
KINDS OF- TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.752
AVAILABLE I THINK I MENTIONED

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.086
IT WAS THE LAST. TIME WE ARE

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:09.688
HEARING THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S-

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:10.989
THEY'RE TAKING RICE STRAW AND

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:12.925
MAKING PRESS BORED OUT OF IT

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:13.992
AND THE REASON THEY'RE DOING

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:14.827
THAT AND THIS IS PRIVATE.

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:16.562
INVESTMENT NO HELP FROM THE

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:18.630
GOVERNMENT. NOT BECAUSE THEY

00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:20.132
HAVE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.366
RICE STRAW THE FARMERS NEED

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.035
SOMEPLACE TO GO WITH IT AND-

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.571
IT'S REDUCING CARBON. IT'S

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:26.205
DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED TO

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.074
DO. IN THIS CASE WE'RE WE'RE

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.776
INCENTIVIZING HAVE NO PROBLEM

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.611
WITH THAT BUT IT'S THE POLICY.

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:34.746
THAT CAUSES THE PROBLEM. IT IS

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.648
A POLICY NOT CAL A CALIFORNIA

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.851
PROBLEM IS IF IT'S IF FOR THIS

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.752
60% OF THE LAND IT'S MANAGED IN

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:41.887
CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDERAL

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.655
GOVERNMENT. THE POLICIES ARE

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:46.191
HORRIBLE IN THE SUPPLY OF

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:48.660
PRODUCT. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.896
SO THE FOR SERVICE WHAT DOES

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.065
PROJECTS BUT I CALM SPLAT

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:55.234
THERE'S PROJECT HERE THERE'S A

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.002
PROJECT A HUNDRED MILES AWAY.

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.136
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FIFTY MILES

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.172
AWAY AND THERE'S NO CONTINUOUS

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.074
SUPPLY. OF THIS WOODY BIOMASS

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.009
THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.844
BEAT THEM DOWN THE FOREST. AND

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:06.979
SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.280
NEED IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.048
NEED TO DRESS IS. WE NEED TO GO

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.583
FIRST IN MY OPINION WE NEED TO

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.485
GO WATERSHED BY WATERSHED TO

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:17.189
TAKE A WATERSHED. AND WE SAY

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:17.756
OKAY WE'RE GONNA TREAT THIS

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:18.590
WATERSHED. SO WE DIDN'T THEIR

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:19.625
SERVE DIFFERENT WATERSHEDS IN

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:22.561
CALIFORNIA. WE SAY OKAY W'RE

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:23.195
TALKING ON THIS WATER SHOULD WE

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:28.834
DO A. THE STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.869
SO THIS SAYS THE FOR SERVICE

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:34.907
WILL SUPPLY. THE COMMODITY THAT

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.109
COMES OUT OF THIS WATERSHED IS

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:39.177
SOON AS YOU GET THAT DONE. WHAT

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.512
WE NEED WE NEED SOME REASON

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:41.613
HELP FROM THE FEDERAL

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.447
GOVERNMENT HER TO SAY WE'RE

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.650
GONNA DO THIS THE PRIVATE

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.350
INVESTMENT IS THERE THE

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.985
TECHNOLOGY IS THERE TO DO THESE

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.187
OTHER THEIR THIRD OF BIO FUEL

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:51.490
PLANT IN LAKEVIEW OREGON

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:52.124
HUNDRED MILES FROM MY HOME THAT

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.093
IS MAKING. BIOENERGY OP OF

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.063
FORCED RESIDUE- SO I THINK FOR

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.665
US IT'S MORE OF A POLICY FIXED

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.700
AND IT IS A MONEY FIX WE NEED

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:02.935
TO SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA GO

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.202
WATERSHED BY WATERSHED

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:06.471
ENTREATIES WATERSHEDS WE CAN

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.073
THROW MONEY AT IT ALL DAY LONG

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.974
AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.143
PRIVATE INVESTMENT PRIVATE

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:11.777
PEOPLE WILL COME WHEN THEY CAN

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.378
GO TO THEIR BANK. AND THEY CAN

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:16.014
TELL THE BANK HEY I HAVE A

00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:17.015
TWENTY FIVE YEAR SUPPLY OF

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:20.018
PRODUCT THAT WE CAN TURN INTO

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:23.622
YOU KNOW WHATEVER BIOFUELS YOU

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:24.222
NAME IT BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.257
PUT THAT INVESTMENT IN THERE

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:29.161
UNTIL WE HAVE SOME MATURITY.

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:29.695
THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET THE

TO SEEK ADDITIONAL ARGUED THAT

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:18.416
MAY BE MORE GENERAL PURPOSE TO

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:20.018

THE QUESTION CENTER STERN IT'S

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.629
ABSOLUTELY THE INTENT TO CREATE

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:32.097
PURPOSE MEANING THE ENTIRETY OF

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:33.298
THE CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:33.965
CHALLENGE THAT WAS THE

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.867
APPROACH. THAT WE UNDERTOOK

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.168
LAST YEAR AND FOR ALL THE

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.670
OBVIOUS REASONS DID NOT HAVE A

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:39.537
CHANCE TO ENGAGE SO MUCH WITH

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:41.273
THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DESIGN

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:42.440
OF THAT IN THE DETAILS BUT IT

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.142
IS THE INTERNET AND WE THINK WE%

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:44.976
CAN GET THERE BY BUILDING UP

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:47.178
FROM BEST. BUY LEVEL TEST IN

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.747
SPECIFIC SECTORS BUT WE DO HAVE

00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:50.482
A VIEW OF WHERE CAPITAL NEEDS

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:51.883
TO FLOW FOR THE BROADER MARKET

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.919
WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT INBOUND

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.020
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT

00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:56.788
ACROSS WHAT I THINK WE- WOULD

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:57.989
CONSIDER THE ENTIRE CLIMATE

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.158
INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA. BOB AND

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.593
IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE ACTUALLY

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.128
THE CENTERS PART QUESTION NOT

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:04.663
GENERATION THIS IS PAIRED WITH

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:07.599
FUNCTIONALITY AT GOBIZ BY WHICH

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.067
THOSE TWO CRITICAL THINGS THE

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.335
FUNDS SO THAT I MAY BUT THE

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:11.436
CATALYST PROGRAM HAS TWO

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:12.871
COMPONENTS THAT GO IS. ONE OF

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:13.705
WHICH IS THE DEEP SECTOR

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:15.507
UNDERSTANDING THAT IS REQUIRED

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:16.641
TO KNOW WHERE THESE CAPITAL

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.176
GAPS ARE WHERE ENTREPRENEURSHIP

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.978
IS CHALLENGING WHERE WE MIGHT

00:26:20.045 --> 00:26:21.713
LEVERAGE OTHER PARTNERSHIPS-

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.514
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.982
MARKETING BARRIERS ARE

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:26.518
PARTICULAR. ISSUES VIDAK IN THE

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:27.986
FOR SECTOR AND OTHER PIECES

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:29.154
GOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION ALL

THE STATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:32.157
BIGELOW RELATIONSHIP STATE

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:34.125
FEDERAL AND WISELY POINTED OUT

00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:34.793
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.161
OPTIMIZING FOR THAT AND

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.395
CRITICALLY ALLOCATING PUBLIC

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.964
GRANTS TO SUPPORT BY THE

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.398

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.967
FORMATION. SO THIS IS THIS IS

ABSOLUTELYINTENDED TO ACHIEVE

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:44.502
THAT KIND OF SCALE WE'RE

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:45.770
LOOKING AT PROCESSES LIKE THIS

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:47.572
COPING PLAN FOR SIGNALS ABOUT

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.240
WHERE. THE STATE'S

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:51.176
INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITIES LIE.

00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.777
AND IT IS FUN CAN SCALE TO

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:55.814
ACHIEVE THAT BUILDING FROM THIS

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.414
TARGETED SET OF INTERVENTIONS

00:26:56.481 --> 00:27:05.690
THAT ARE UP FRONT OF US NOW.

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:06.124
BASED ON THE AGENCY

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:06.858
PARTNERSHIPS IN THESE TWO

AS A PERHAPS SHOULD BE USED

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.731
WHEN WE THINK THE ROOF-

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.425
AFFILIATE A FAIR OR STATE

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.959
PHILLY AFFAIR WHEN THEY GO IN

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:23.961
TO GET THEIR COVERT TESTS AND

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:25.363
YES THEY ALL NEED THE

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.731
ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT TYPE OF

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:30.067
WORK SO I KNOW WE HAVE ELIO HAD

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:37.675
SOME COMMENTS. AT THE

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:39.677
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:40.445
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:41.913
LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.848
OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STATE

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:45.149
AFFILIATE AFFAIRS UNTIL THE MAY

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:46.851
REVISION- WE FIND THAT

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:47.885
PROVIDING OPERATIONAL SUPPORT

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.387
IS REASONABLE SINCE FARES HAVE

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:51.255
BEEN UNABLE TO CONDUCT FORMAL

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:53.291
REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.293
TO THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER THE

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.594
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ASSUME

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.595
THAT THERE'S WILL BE UNABLE TO

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:59.230
CONDUCT NORMAL OPERATIONS IN

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:01.299
THE BUDGET YEAR- WE FIND THAT

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.066
THERE'S STILL UNCERTAINTY

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:03.401
REGARDING THIS GIVEN THAT

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.902
SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:06.838
MIGHT BE UPDATED AS MORE PEOPLE

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:07.638
ARE VACCINATED ACROSS THE

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.774
STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT DELAYING

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.242
ACTION ON THIS ITEM BUT A LOT

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.910
OF THE LEGISLATURE TO USE THE

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:13.611
ADDITIONAL TIME TO IMPLEMENT

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:17.482
THE DECISION. ON THE

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:18.449
APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO PROVIDE-

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:20.685

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:33.351
LINE IS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:34.885

INDUCED RECESSION IN OBVIOUSLY

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.163
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC OF

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.231
EFFECTIVE CARE TO CLOSE THEIR

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.000

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.635
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL PARTS OF

CALIFORNIA. AT COUNTY FAIRS

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:55.039
STATE FAIRS. THEY ARE MAIN

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.274
DRIVERS FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:59.443
ECONOMIES. IN MORE AND MORE IF

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.746
WE ARE RELYING ON STATE FAIRS.

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:04.315
COUNTY FAIRS AG ASSOCIATIONS TO

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:06.150
BE ABLE TO HOUSE AT CRITICAL

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:07.752
NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:09.920
IS ACROSS THE STATE. NGUYEN YES

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:12.790
SETS UP- AN EVACUATION SHELTER.

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:15.426
OR WIN A LOCAL COMMUNTY SET UP

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.495
A BASE CAMP WITH CAL FIRE- IT'S

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.397
NOT **** IS A STATE OWNED

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:21.198
FACILITY- COUNTY ON DISABILITY.

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.633
ALL FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.668
RIGHTFULLY SO TO BE ABLE TO

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:26.137
OPEN UP THEIR DOORS. IN WHAT WE

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.139
NOW IS THAT WE NEED FAIR'S FAIR

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.808
GROUNDS MORE THAN EVER. AND

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.143
WHAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:34.378
IS- THROUGH THE WESTERN FAIRS

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:35.279
ASSOCIATION THERE'S ALWAYS IN

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:36.280
COLLABORATION WITH THE

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:37.181
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.150
LEGISLATURE. THAT WHAT WORKS

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:41.385
FOR ONE WORKS FOR ALL. IN NOW

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:43.421
WHAT THIS PROPOSALS FOCUSING ON

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.256
ARE JUST STATE FAIRS IN AGRA

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.091
SUFFICIENT. WE'RE LEAVING THE

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.359
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.827
COUNTY FAIRS OUT OF IT. AND

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:50.561
WE'RE GOING AWAY FROM THE

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.163
FORMULA THAT IS ALWAYS WORKED

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:54.031
IN AS BEEN TRIED AND TRUE.

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:57.535
FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF AB

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:58.135
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE AND THAT

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.937
IS THE GREAT BILL. THAT TAKES A

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.505
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT IS SOLD. SO

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:02.773
WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE WERE

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.442
YEAR AND ARREARS ABOUT SEVEN

00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:06.143
MILLION COMING INTO THAT.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.344
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S GOING

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:08.879
TO BE OPEN FOR ALL FEARS IT'S A

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:16.053
DROP IN THE BUCKET ABOUT. WHAT

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.421
FIGURES NEED. AND THERE'S A AT

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:18.923
AUTOMATIC TO SIX SO IT'S JUST

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:19.957
SAY WE'RE GOING CLOSE TO. IT'S

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.827
JUST NOT. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE-

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:24.695
MY CASKET THIS COMES TO US-

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.296
THAT THIS IS GOING BE OPEN UP

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:27.798
TO ALL FARES. IN ONE MORE SPIN.

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.033
RISK NINETY SIX BILLION

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.967
RIGHTFULLY SO TO BE A HELP

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.569
SMALL BUSINESSES AND MOST OF.

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.471
FOR ARGUING OVER FOR. MILLION

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.772
ENSURING IT'S GONNA BE OPEN UP

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.640
THE COUNTY FAIRS I THINK THAT

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.742
WE CAN DO BETTER WITH HOPE THAT

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:38.409
WE'RE GONNA BE A TO SEE AN

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:39.844
EXPANDED PACKAGE COMING BACK.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:41.812
WELL IT LOOKS IF THE MATHIS

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.047
RIGHT WE HAVE TWENTY MILLION

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.582
LEFT OVER FROM LAST YEAR

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.183
CORRECT EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.018
CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS THEN WE

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.587
HAVE TO FIFTY MILLION. THAT WE

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:50.788
GET THIS TEN MILLION SORTS OF.

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:54.859
THE WORKING NUMBER IS EIGHTY

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:55.493
MILLION SECURE SPOT. VICE CHAIR

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:59.597
DOLLARS. WHAT THE METHODOLOGY

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:03.534
AND- THE- WHICH- SHARES ARE

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:08.572
DISTRICT FAIR ARE THIRD OR. THE

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:09.640
SENATE IT'S BASED ON THE

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.476
GOVERNOR STRUCTURE. I SO IF

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:14.879
IT'S A EIGHT EIGHT IT'S A STATE

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.814
AND TO AND A POP AS A STATE

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.583
AGENCY AND SO IT WAS ON THAT-

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.819
AND THIS IS NOT IMPRESSED- AND

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.988
PREVIOUS ALLOCATIONS LARGE

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:26.791
BEARS- DID NOT RECEIVE THOSE

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.659
ALLOCATIONS IT WAS BASED ON

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:31.162
FINANCIAL NEED- AND SO THIS IS

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:33.063
THIS IS BASED ON THE GOVERNMENT

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.566
STRUCTURE AS A WAY TO

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.701
PRIORITIZE. A SPENDING. AND

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.670
ULTIMATELY BECAUSE THE STATE

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.939
ITSELF IS OBLIGATED AT THE

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.507
BEARS CANNOT MEET THEIR

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:46.043
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WE HAVE A

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.579
LIABILITY THERE IS THE STATE.

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:49.914
SO ALL LISTED I WANT TO TACK ON

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.615
THE CENTER REQUIRES COMMENTS

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:53.417
THEY WHEN YOU SHOW UP TO THE

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:54.418
WHEN THAT WHEN THERE'S A FIRE

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.719
WHEN THERE'S A PANDEMIC WHEN

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.688
YOU SHOW UP YOU DON'T THE KICK

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.255
AND STILL DIRECT THEM IN A WAY

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.423
THAT ALIGNS WITH STATE POLICY

01:09:54.490 --> 01:10:00.195
BILLS. OKAY FIVE THANK YOU.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.531
FIVE- BELIAU YOU HAVE A

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:06.101
DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS. I'M

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.102
MISTER FRENCH MAN IS WITH THE

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:09.438
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

01:10:09.505 --> 01:10:10.439
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:11.774
WAS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL THAT

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.908
MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.944
THIS WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE I'M

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.745
PRIOR TO GOING INTO MY ARM

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:19.348
ASSESSMENT- BUT OVERALL WE FIND

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:20.883
THAT ADJUSTING THE MOLASSES MAN

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:21.584
IS WARRANTED GIVEN THE

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.918
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.453
DEPARTMENT SPECIAL FINE- IS THE

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.722
DPR FONG. WE FIND THAT

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:27.823
ESTABLISHING A TIERED BELL

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.758
ASSESSMENT THAT PLACES A HIGHER

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.427
CHARGE ON MORE TOXIC PESTICIDE

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:33.262
IS REASONABLE AND COULD ADDRESS

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:36.865
ISSUES RELATED TO THE NEGATIVE

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:37.633
EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE USE- WE

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.867
ALSO FINE. THAT THE SPENDING.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:40.636
PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:41.637
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT IT

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.238
LARGELY ASSIST THE STATE IN

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:45.407
REDUCING PESTICIDE USAGE. AND

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:46.542
EXPAND THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.744
UPHOLDING PESTICIDE LAWS AND

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.980
REGULATIONS. HAVE A RECOMMEND

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.081
THAT THE LEGISLATURE BASIN ANY

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.415
TOURNAMENT ASSESSMENT AND ONE

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.250
OR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THE

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:55.851
FOUR YEARS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:58.120
PROPOSING. FIND AT A FOR YOUR

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.389
FACE AND IS- QUITE LONG

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:01.490
ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT AS

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:02.858
THE FACE AN WOULD REDUCE SHORT

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.360
TERM COST THE BUYERS AND

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.161
SELLERS OF PESTICIDES. IT DOES

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:08.330
HAVE SOME NOTABLE DRAWBACKS-

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.999
ONE AND POTENTIALLY A WEEKENDS

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.567
THE MARKET SIGNALED THAT THE

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:12.968
PROPOSAL'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:15.037
SPREADING OUT- THE RATE

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.039
INCREASES OVER FOUR YEARS. AND

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.641
THEN IT GENERATES A SMALL

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.908
AMOUNT OF REVENUES EARLY ON

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:23.712
WHICH REQUIRES SOME GENERAL

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:24.613
FUND TO COVER PROPOSED SPENDING-

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.515
AND ARE. WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.383
BASIN SO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.018
PROPOSAL THAT USES THE SAME

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.086
RATE. BUT ARE IMPLEMENTED A ONE

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:33.222
OR ONE OR TWO YEARS AND WE

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:34.723
THINK THAT PROVIDES-

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.058
FLEXIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.862
ALSO PROVIDES- SPENDING OUR

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:40.396
REVENUES TO COVER PROPOSED

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.064
SPENDING. I WOULD ALSO

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.165
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:45.134
ALIGN ANY NEW SPENDING WITH THE

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.668
RATE AT WHICH REVENUES ARE

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.603
GENERATED- WE BELIEVE THIS

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:50.139
ALLOWS- NúMERO MILK NúMERO

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:51.874
REVENUES THE FULLY FUND THAT

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.942
PROPOSED SPENDING. ELIMINATES

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:54.943
GENERAL FUND COSTS AND

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:56.111
POTENTIALLY PROVIDES MORE

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.846
IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE DPR

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.482
FIND. THEN WE ALSO HAVE TO-

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.017
LARGER POLICY QUESTIONS THAT

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:03.786
THE LEGISLATURE- MIGHT

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.321
CONSIDER. ONE IS SIGNAL WHERE

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:09.091
THE BEST BASIS FOR TIERED TAX-

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:11.160
MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:13.529
BASE ITS TIERED MELLUS BASED ON

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.065
A- PRODUCTS SIGNAL WORD. WHICH

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.800
INDICATES A PRODUCTS RELATIVELY

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.102
CUTE TOXICITY TO HUMANS. AND

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.403
SPEAKING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.671
ACUTE TOXICITY DOESN'T

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:23.906
NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.241
CHRONIC TOXICITY OR LARGER

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.544
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS- SO THE

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.813
EXTENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL-

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:32.548
ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES IS.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.416
UNCLEAR AS TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:35.851
MAY WISH TO EXPLORE THE

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.653
FEASIBILITY OF- ALTERNATIVES

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.754
THAT COULD ADDRESS A BROADER

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:40.255
RANGE OF PESTICIDE RELATED

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:43.826
CONCERNS. AND ALSO- SHOULD THE

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.627
PROPOSAL REFLECT REVENUE

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.696
TARGETS ARE MARKET SIGNAL- THE

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:48.897
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RATE

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.032
INCREASES WOULD RAISE ENOUGH

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.366
REVENUES TO COVER PROPOSED

01:12:51.433 --> 01:12:52.201
SPENDING ONCE FULLY

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:54.470
IMPLEMENTED. THAT WOULD ADDRESS

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.505
THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:58.307
DPR FINE IN THE LONG RUN.

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:59.208
HOWEVER UPON FULL

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.076
IMPLEMENTATION THE PROPOSAL

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.644
WOULD LIKELY WIDE IN THE PRICE

01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:05.214
DIFFERENCEBETWEEN THE HIGHEST

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:05.814
AND LOWEST TIER BY ROUGHLY TWO

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:07.783
PERCENT. I FIND THAT THE

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:08.684
RELATIVELY SMALL PRICE

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:10.252
DIFFERENCE WOULD NOT LIKELY

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.421
RESULT IN A LARGE- CHANGE IN

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:13.989
THE MIX OF PESTICIDES USED IN

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.924
THE STATE. THE LEGISLATURE-

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:18.293
COULD CONSIDER- A DIFFERENT SET

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.966
OF RATES THAN BEING. PROPOSED

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.300
BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OKAY IT

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:27.169
IS. THE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.537
THE SAME GRADE PEST WE WANT

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:32.141
PEOPLE TO MOVE TO LA LESS TOXIC-

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:33.308
PESTICIDES IN IT MAY BE. IT MAY

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.511
NOT BE THE PHARMACY THE- MENON

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.846
WITH CAN GET ON THE SHELF IS

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:41.016
PRETTY TOXIC AND- WE KNOW FROM

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.351
FIRES THAT SOMETIMES. I'LL SAVE

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.119
THESE THINGS LIKE A TREASURE

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.487
FOR YEARS THOUSAND HUNDREDS

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:47.156
DECADES YOU KNOW THEY WANNA

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:47.723
THEY BOUGHT SOMETHING IN THE

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.928
SIXTIES. IF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.897
THE VIEWS THE FEDERAL T. SIGNAL

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.365
WORD IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:57.132
EVERYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.634
WHETHER IT'S BETTER OR WORSE

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.536
WHAT WOULD YOU. PROPOSE FOR

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:04.273
WHAT IS THE IS. ERIN CALIFORNIA

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:06.041
HAS MANY OF THEIR OWN STANDARDS%

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:06.975
SO THAT I DON'T WANT OPEN UP

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.243
THAT CAN OF WORMS TO SAY WELL

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.444
THIS IS WHAT THE REST OF STATES

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.079
DO WITH THIS IS CALIFORNIA WHAT

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.148
WOULD. WHAT WOULD IT BE WHAT

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.516
WHAT WHAT GIVE ME SOME IDEA OF

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:18.153
WHAT WOULD USE OTHER THAN THE

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.090
WORDS- MISTER CHAIR OFFICE

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:22.958
DOESN'T HAVE BEEN NAMED

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.160
ALTERNATIVE- AT THIS POINT IN

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.262
TIME- WE'RE JUST POINTING OUT

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.464
THAT. IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.099
LARGER AFFECTS THE NEGATIVE

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:32.668
EFFECTS RELATED TO PESTICIDES

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.002
THAT SIGNAL WORD WHAT

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.304
NECESSARILY CAPTURE ALL OF THEM

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.672
SO JUST POINTING THAT OUT TO

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.373
THE LEGISLATURE AND- MAYBE

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.741
EVEN- CONSIDERING OTHER

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.344
ALTERNATIVES FROM THIS POINT.

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:44.146
AND DURING ITS DELIBERATIONS.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:47.249
OKAY GOOD ENOUGH FOR US CENTER

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:51.486
DOLLY- MY GOSH OKAY THE- FIRST

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:54.456
OFF. I GOT A QUESTION WHAT WHAT

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:57.659
SO. THE MIL TAXES BEEN STATIC

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.294
BUT IT'S GROWN OVER OVER THE

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.230
OVER THE YEARS BY MORE THAN

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:03.532
TWENTY MILLION WHICH- HAS A LOT

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:05.200
OF THE DPR BUDGET TO GROW YET

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.269
FACING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:07.769
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:11.506
OCCURRED. WELL SURE SENATOR

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.008
DOLLY- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:15.377
NUMBER OF NEW OBLIGATIONS OVER

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:16.845
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:18.780
INCLUDING PERS PAYMENTS THAT

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.449
WE'VE HAD TO MAKE. EMPLOYEE

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.751
COMPENSATION AND YOU KNOW THE

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:25.153
DEMAND OUR PROGRAMS HAS BECOME

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.889
THAT MUCH GREATER AS WELL SO.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:28.690
WE'RE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.792
ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. WITH THE

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.294
SAME AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THE

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.229
BILL'S BEEN STATIC AS YOU POINT

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:36.098
OUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR.

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.132
AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.367
REALLY NEED TO MAKE NEW

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.168
INVESTMENTS TO REFLECT SOME OF

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.103
THE NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.538
DOING- I'M MINDFUL OF BEING A

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:44.573
CAREFUL STEWARD OF TAXPAYER

PART OF MY CHARGE YOUR- AS THE

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.444
DIRECTOR OF THE PART. OF THE

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.313
DEPARTMENT. BUT WHAT WE'RE

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.114
BEING ASKED TO DO BY

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.815
CALIFORNIANS FROM THOSE IN THE

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.617

OUR NEW AND I REALLY WANT TO BE

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:59.988
ABLE TO INVEST IN. IN PRACTICES

AND TOOLS AND THINGS THAT WILL

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:05.093
BENEFIT WHAT CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.662
ASKING US NOW. I THAT

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.330

THE COST OF- EMPLOYEES IS

01:16:10.299 --> 01:16:12.067
CONSTANTLY GOING UP IN THE

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:13.402
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.870
YOUR YOU HAVE EIGHT MILLION

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.506
DOLLAR DEFICIT. WHILE YOU'RE

ASKING TO INCREASE THE TAX

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.944
WHICH I BELIEVE IS VERY- MISS

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.245
GUY I THINK THIS WHOLE THING'S

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:24.780
MISS KIND I THINK THE WRONG

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.222
STAY SAFE. AT THIS TIME WE'RE

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:36.658
GONNA CHANGE THE WHOLE. CONCEPT

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:40.529
OF HOW WE- REGULATE AND TAX

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:41.530
THESE PRODUCTS EASIER HOUSEHOLD

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:43.298
PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE USE

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.233
EVERYDAY I MEAN CENTER MCGUIRE

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.436
HAS A BOTTLE OVER HERE THAT HAS

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.404
INTERNET TIES ARE NOT THAT.

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.073
COULD BE TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:53.241
SO WHY IS THE TIME RIGHT NOW I

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.343
THINK I THINK WE NEED TO WAIT

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.344
ON THIS I THINK IT'S THE WRONG

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.912
TIME LOOK AS A FORMER WE'VE

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.947
BEEN USING. AND TRYING TO

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.515
REDUCE- LOOK WE DON'T WANT TO

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:01.817
USE THESE PRODUCTS WE HAVE TO

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.552
USE THESE PRODUCTS. IS SAME AS

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.787
THE HOUSEWIFE OR THE- THE

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.222
GENTLEMAN AT HOME THAT IS

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:09.224
TRYING TO KEEP HIS FAMILY SAFE.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.927
SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.328
GOING AT A TIME I THINK THIS IS

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:14.629
JUST TOTALLY THE WRONG TIME I

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.465
THINK TO THE CHANGING HOW WE'RE

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:18.667
GOING TO IDENTIFY THEM. IS NOT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.902
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND ON TOP

01:17:20.969 --> 01:17:22.671
OF THAT. BUT WE DID TALK ABOUT

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.207
OF ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS ASKING

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:27.442
FOR ANOTHER FIVE MILLION

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.544
DOLLARS TO DO THAT THE I. T.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.480
PROCESS WHICH IS. YOU KNOW

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.315
MAYBE A HIGHER DISNEYLAND THEY

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.549
SEEM TO MOVE PEOPLE VERY

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:35.817
EFFICIENTLY AND HAVE WITH THE

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.452
WAY TO GET THINGS DONE. AND

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.554
THAT THE I. T. IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.423
WHETHER IT'S THE E. D. WHETHER

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:46.795
IT'S DPR WEATHER'S DGSE.

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.096
WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW THE-

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:49.831
DEPART- NAG THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:50.899
FIGURE OUT THERE IT WAS IT'S A

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.902
BOY. AND IT'S- FUN. AND IT'S

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.437
BECAUSE- SO FROM I THINK THIS

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.938
IS. TOTALLY THE WRONG TO. I

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.206
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.307
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IS

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.642
BECAUSE WE'RE USING LESS

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.978
PESTICIDES. WE ARE WE'RE AND

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:04.479
THAT'S A PROVEN FACT THAT WERE

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:05.280
USING LESS WERE USING SOFTER

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.583
ONES. M. AND WE'RE DRAW AND

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.652
MORE SO AS THAT. DECREASES THE

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.686
REVENUE HAS TO COME UP

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.588
SOMEWHERE WE GET THAT. BUT AT

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:14.756
THE END OF THE DAY THIS THIS IS

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:16.425
THE WRONG TIME I DIMINISH THE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:18.293
PANDEMIC TAX. RIGHT NOW WHEN

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.929
PEOPLE NEED. TO USE THESE

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.664
PRODUCTS YOU'RE PUTTING A TAX

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:23.932
ON IT SO FOR ME IT'S WRONG AND

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.233
I WANT TO JUST CLOSE WITH LAST

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.234
THING THAT I THINK IS THE MOST

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.903
IMPORTANT THING IN CALIFORNIA

01:18:27.969 --> 01:18:28.470
RIGHT NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.639
PESTICIDES. THERE ARE LITERALLY

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:33.375
THOUSANDS. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:37.245
GROWING. POT MARIJUANA. IT ALL

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:39.114
OVER THE PLACE USING PESTICIDES

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:40.749
THAT ARE AND AREN'T BEING

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.318
ENFORCED ARE BEING REGULATED

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:44.219
AND IT'S DESTROYING OUR

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:47.055
WILDLIFE AND OUR IN OUR STREAMS

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:48.824
AND HAVE THAT THAT'S A FACT AND

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:49.458
IF THE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.692
JUST GO TO GOOGLE EARTH AND

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.894
LOOK AT SISKIYOU COUNTY. IS

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.996
IT'S CRAZY IF THERE'S A PLACE

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.064
THAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:57.265
SOMETHING ABOUT PESTICIDES DR

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:59.000
WE WILL BE FOCUSING WOULD BE

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.836
PUT IN A PANDEMIC TAX RIGHT NOW

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.337
WHEN PEOPLE ARE NEEDING THESE

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:03.538
AND WE'RE GONNA CONFUSE AMONG

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:04.873
THE LABELING FOR THE PEOPLE

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.474
THAT ARE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.109
IT. SO I THINK THIS NEED TO BE

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:08.343
A LITTLE MORE WELL THOUGHT OUT

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.080
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE YOU

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:12.681
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.983
YOUR DEFICIT. IT TAKE SOME TIME

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.384
THIS I THINK IS TOLD MISSED IN

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.120

PART OF THE STATE WHERE MANY

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.502
ILLEGAL PESTICIDES THAT ARE

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.769
BROUGHT IN FROM OUT OF THE

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:36.738
UNITED STATES AND USED IN THESE

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.106
MARIJUANA GROWS. REALLY WREAK

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.441

I WILL TAKE THE HIT FOR WHAT

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:00.028
WE'VE DONE INCORRECTLY IN THE

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:02.230
PAST I THINK WE'VE RETHOUGHT

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.266
THE WAY WE'RE DOING ELECTRONIC

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:05.834

FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:10.839
YEAR IS FAR MORE POSSIBLE. BUT

NON RESTRICTED MATERIAL BUT WE

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:28.523
REALLY FELT THAT THE SIGNAL

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.526
WORDS. WERE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.695
TO USERS OF PESTICIDES. AROUND

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:34.896
THE STATE AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.498

USING IN TERMS OF. PROPERTY

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.344
ACTION TOOLS I THINK THAT'S AN

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:51.379
IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB. ABOUT

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.914
50% OF THE PESTICIDES THAT WE

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.449
REGULATE HERE AT THE P. R. OR

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.418
USED IN. THE AGRICULTURAL

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.286
SETTING IN ABOUT 50% YOU'D FIND

WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.492
PROPOSAL. IS WORK TO SUPPORT

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.628
WHAT I HEAR EVERY DAY FROM LOTS

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.796
OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:09.497
GROWERS. AND HOUSEHOLD FOLKS

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.966
AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES AND

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.500
OTHERS WHO WERE IMPACTED. BY

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.935
PESTICIDES AND THAT'S TO

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.503
CONTINUE THE TRANSITION. THAT

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.239
THE STATE HAS EMBARKED ON OVER

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.673
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS TO.

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.508
SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:21.977
TO MANAGE PASS. YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.945
THE PESTICIDE USE REPORTS THAT

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:25.814
I SEE EVERY YEAR DO INDICATE.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.115
THAT THE USE OF THINGS LIKE

01:21:27.182 --> 01:21:29.217
BIOPESTICIDES AND SO OFFERS

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.353
ANOTHER ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. ARE

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:32.787
GOING UP. AND THE MORE

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:35.156
DANGEROUS OR TOXIC PESTICIDES

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.424
LIKE FUMIGANTS INORGANIC

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:37.692
PHOSPHATES AND OTHERS. ARE

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.561
GOING DOWN. WHAT WE HOPE TO DO

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.062
WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.597
ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION. I

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.833
JUST WANT TO SAY LOOK I'M NOT.

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.835
MAKING THIS PERSONAL I BELIEVE

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.370
IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU'RE

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.406
THING. AND I'M AND I'M NOT.

STARTING TO GO MAINSTREAM TODAY

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.058
THERE ARE FORTY SIX DIFFERENT

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:26.760
AVAILABLE AND MANY MORE ARE ON

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:30.331
THE WAY. EARLY NEXT YEAR FORD

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.799
IS PLANNING TO RELEASE AN

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:33.133
ELECTRIC MODELS OF ITS

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.202
SIGNATURE. F. ONE FIFTY PICKUP

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:37.504
TRUCK WHICH IS THE BEST SELLING

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.540
CAR IN AMERICA. AND ACCORDING

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.809
TO FORD THE ELECTRIC MODEL WILL

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.844
HAVE THE BEST HORSE POWER THE

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.546
BEST WORK AND THE BEST

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:49.083
ACCELERATION OF ANY F. ONE

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:50.884
FIFTY SO. DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE-

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:51.418
IT ACTUALLY MEANS YOU'RE

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:53.787
GETTING- A BETTER PERFORMING

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:56.290
VEHICLE. AND THE FORD F. ONE

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:57.024
FIFTY OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:58.792
ABLE TO CHARGE YOUR POWER TOOLS

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.694
FROM THE VEHICLE AND FORD IS

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:03.430
ALSO- HAVING. THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.765
THE VEHICLETO PUT TO SUPPLY

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.800
ENERGY BACK TO THE GRID SO

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:07.501
THEY'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:08.969
THIS AS HOW DO WE CREATE A

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:12.239
WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:12.806
ELECTROCUTION THAT BENEFITS

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:15.576
CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIA HAS OVER

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:16.143
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOES

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.412
FOLD WHICH IS JUST SHY OF HALF

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:21.315
OF THE U. S. TOTAL. AND I THINK

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.783
WHEN IT COMES TO ZERO EMISSION

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:25.753
TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. IS

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:27.721
THE NEW MICHIGAN. FOR THEIR

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:29.423
MISSION VEHICLES WERE BECAME

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:31.392
OUR NUMBER ONE EXPORT LAST YEAR

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:32.092
THEY WERE NUMBER TWO THE YEAR

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:34.328
BEFORE. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:35.662

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.932
AND THIRTY FOUR THAT RELATED

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:43.470
MANUFACTURERS WITH A TOTAL OF

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.104
SEVENTY THOUSAND DIRECT JOBS IN

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:46.407
THE INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:40:46.473 --> 01:40:47.975
NEWSOME BUDGET- WILL HELP THE

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.377
STATE SCALE UP AND OVERCOME KEY

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.979
BARRIERS TO ELECTRIFYING THEIR

MISSION VEHICLES. ASSEMBLY THE

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:55.682
PROGRAM PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:58.118
AB EIGHT PROGRAM PROVIDES FIVE

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:59.753
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:00.454
INCENTIVES FOR THEIR MISSION

01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:03.023
VEHICLES. AND GRANT THE C. C.

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.425
BONDING AUTHORITY TO FRONT LOAD

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:06.693
BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT IN

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.161
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.762
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I WOULD

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:10.230
EMPHASIZE THAT RUSSIAN VEHICLE

01:41:10.297 --> 01:41:11.365
INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES BOTH

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:14.668
BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.503
ELECTRIC. INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHY

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.672
INVEST IN VEHICLES NOW THE

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:20.808
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A

01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:21.442
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR GREEN

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:23.577

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:25.179
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO SCRAP

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.047
AN OLDER VEHICLE AND REPLACE IT

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:29.082
WITH THE ZERO OR NEAR ZERO

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:31.018
EMISSION VEHICLE. THE BUDGET

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:32.986
ALSO PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.121
FIFTEEN MILLION FOR CARB HEAVY

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.656
VEHICLE INCENTIVES PROGRAM

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.591
PROJECT. WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:39.893
TO REPLACE DIESEL VEHICLES WITH

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.929
ZERO EMISSIONS REPLACEMENT. ANY

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:44.832
GRANT PROGRAMS REALLY PROVIDE.

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:46.800
EARLY EDITION REDUCTIONS BEFORE

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.902
REGULATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:49.837
THAT WOULD MANDATE THE SWITCH

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:51.238
TO ELECTRIC. AND THESE

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.474
PROGRAMS- ARE CRITICAL FOR AIR

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.475
DISTRICTS THAT ARE REALLY YOU

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.210
KNOW TURNING OVER EVERY ROCK IN

01:41:56.276 --> 01:41:57.411
ORDER TO MEET THE PAYMENT

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:59.346
DEADLINES ARE LOOKING FOR

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.048
EMISSION REDUCTIONS. I'M

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.249
FOCUSED MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:03.817
SIDE CONSENSUS FATHER ENERGY

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.986
THAT- LET ME TALK ABOUT WHY

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:08.322
IT'S IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:10.290
INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. WE OBSERVE

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.192
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONVENIENT

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:14.261
AND UBIQUITOUS ACROSS THE

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:16.530
STATE- WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:17.598
SURE THAT THE MORE THAN HALF OF

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:18.866
CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:20.100
APARTMENT BUILDINGS. FOR

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:21.268
COMFORTABLE BUYING IS THEIR

01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:23.804
MISSION VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:24.338
HAD A CONVENIENT PLACE TO

01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:26.673
REFUEL IT. WITHOUT INVESTMENT

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.375
NOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO MEET

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:30.544
THE STATE'S TARGETS FOR THAT

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:31.745
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TWENTY

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:33.580
TWENTY FIVE. CURRENT GOAL IS TO

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.782
HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.217
CHARGERS TO SUPPORT ONE POINT

01:42:37.284 --> 01:42:38.418
FIVE MILLION EDIE'S AND TWENTY

01:42:38.485 --> 01:42:39.887
TWENTY FIVE. WE CONDUCTED

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.889
ANALYSIS OF ALL THE INVESTMENTS

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.090
THAT WE'RE MAKING UTILITIES ARE

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.625
MAKING PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.593
GROUP THAT'S REPORTED PUBLICLY

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.828
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS A

01:42:47.895 --> 01:42:49.997
SHORTFALL OF SIXTY THOUSAND.

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:52.499
CHARGERS BROUGH TWENTY ONE

01:42:52.566 --> 01:42:53.567
STATIONS SHORT OF THE STATE'S

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:56.503
GOAL OF HAVING TWO HUNDRED

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:57.437
HYDROGEN STATIONS BY TWENTY

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.773
TWENTY FIVE. WE'LL NEED TO

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.575
SIGNIFICANTLY RAMP UP THAT

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:04.177
INFRASTRUCTURE POST TWENTY

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:04.811
TWENTY FIVE TO MEET OUR TARGETS

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:06.113
FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND.

01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:08.415
SO NOW SAYS THAT- WE ARE

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.417
REQUIRED TO DO GOING TO GET THE

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.786
LEGISLATURE IS TO PUBLISH-

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.888
ANALYSIS OF TWENTY THIRTY

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:17.658
CHARGING NEEDS WHICH WAS

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:18.625
REQUIRED BY AB TWENTY ONE

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:19.159
TWENTY SEVEN. WE'VE DONE A

01:43:19.226 --> 01:43:21.161
DRAFT ANALYSIS THAT FINDS THAT

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:22.563
WILL NEED ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:24.698
MILLION CHARGERS TO SUPPORT

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.266
EIGHT MILLION PASSENGERS ADDS.

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.969
AND THIS IS- WHAT THEY ARE

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:30.037
THESE MOBILE SOURCE STRATEGY

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:31.705
INDICATES THAT WOULD PUT US ON

01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:33.974
A TRAJECTORY TO MEET A 100% OF

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:36.843
THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:40.180
OKAY PLAN ADVANCES FOR GOALS.

01:43:40.247 --> 01:43:41.481
IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:43.216
CUTTING CLIMATE POLLUTION

01:43:43.283 --> 01:43:45.252
ADVANCING ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND

01:43:45.319 --> 01:43:48.188
JOB CREATION. PROMOTING EQUITY.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:49.957
ON THE HEALTH SIDE I THINK YOU

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.592
THIS IS NO SURPRISE ALL OF YOU-

01:43:51.658 --> 01:43:53.193
TRANSLATION IS A MAJOR SOURCE

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.362
OF CARBS AIR POLLUTION. IT'S

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:58.065
BECAUSE IT'S THE SOURCE OF 80%

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.366
OF THE STATE NOT FORMING

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:02.069
NITROGEN OXIDES 95% OF ITS

01:44:02.135 --> 01:44:03.670
POWERFUL. DIESEL PARTICULATE

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.439
MATTER AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:06.873
IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES THAT

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.774
LIVE NEAR GOODS MOVEMENT

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:09.242
CORRIDORS. AND THAT ARE

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:10.677
PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THIS

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.579
HARMFUL POLLUTION. ON THE

01:44:12.646 --> 01:44:15.148
CLIENT SIDE- IT'S THE SOURCES

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.150
50% HALF OF OUR GREENHOUSE

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:18.251
GASES WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:19.419
EMISSIONS FROM SHALE

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:21.154
PRODUCTION. AND OVER THE LAST

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:23.190
DECADE WE'VE SEEN OUR EMISSIONS

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:24.958

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:19.165
OPTIONS- FOR EXAMPLE- COULD

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:20.700
EXPLORE MODIFYING THE LEVEL OF

01:57:20.767 --> 01:57:22.468
THE CITY AND MAYBE. SUCH

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:24.203
HONESTY THAT'S- BASED ON A

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:26.005
POLLUTION FROM A VEHICLE RATHER

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.507
THAN JUST SORT OF FLAT. FEE PER

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:29.942
VEHICLE. GOOD CONSIDER TYING

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:32.945
THE LEVEL TO FEED TO INFLATION-

01:57:33.012 --> 01:57:34.113
OREGON JUST CAN CONSIDER

01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.982
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MAKES OF

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:43.956
FUNDING I MENTIONED. SORT OF

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:44.490
THE WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:45.124
FUNDING SOURCES WE HOW FOR BOTH

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.225
YOUR AND SENATE AND FOR FUNDING.

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:47.693
I CONSIDER A MAKES YEAR FOR

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.262
EXAMPLE. WE HAVE SOME. OF YOU

01:57:49.328 --> 01:57:51.364
KNOW I- ABOUT HI ELECTRICITY IN

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.198
THIS IN SOME THE YOU CAN IN A

01:57:52.265 --> 01:57:53.533
BAR. LOOK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:55.201
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER.

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:56.936
SORT OF A DIFFERENT MIX OF

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.571
FUNDING FOR- SEVEN FOR

01:57:58.638 --> 01:57:59.672
STRUCTURE MAY BE SHIFTING SOME

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:00.840
OF THE COSTS AWAY FROM

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.708
ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS TO. EASE

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:05.711
LIKE ADHD IS OR SOME OTHER TYPE

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:07.146
OF FUNDING SOURCE- THE SECOND

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:08.281
QUESTION WE THINK THAT'S

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:09.348
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:10.583
BE THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT'S THE

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.918
NEXT WHAT MAKES THE PROGRAM

01:58:11.984 --> 01:58:15.455
SHOULD BE FUNDED- IDEALLY- THE

01:58:15.521 --> 01:58:16.856
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS WOULD

01:58:16.923 --> 01:58:20.092
BE INFORMED BY- AN ANALYSIS OF

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:21.661
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THE COST

01:58:21.727 --> 01:58:22.495
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:24.263
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:26.365
DISTRIBUTION OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:27.834
THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.469
MANY OF THE ABA PROGRAMS THAT

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:31.471
WE HAVE NOW DO HAVE ESTIMATES

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:34.507
OF- COST PER TON OF EMISSIONS

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:35.975
REDUCTIONS AND SO THOSE ARE

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:36.609
AVAILABLE AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:39.412
A- PORTENT STOP UNFORTUNATELY-

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:40.780
THE INFORMATION ISN'T KIND OF

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:41.981
GATHERED AND PRESENTED HASN'T

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:43.216
BEEN PRESENTED TO US IN A WAY

01:58:43.282 --> 01:58:44.317
WHERE IT'S EASY TO KIND OF

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:45.551
COMPARE ACROSS ALL THE

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:47.253
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO.

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.688
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO

01:58:48.754 --> 01:58:50.189
CONTINUE TO WORK TO TRY TO

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:50.690
GATHER AND WORK WITH THE

01:58:50.756 --> 01:58:53.693
ADMINISTRATION. HOPEFULLY HELP

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:54.794
PRESERVE IT WASN'TINFORMATION

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:55.661
THAT HELPS YOU KIND OF COMPARE

01:58:55.728 --> 01:58:57.396
THE COST EFFECTIVENESS TODAY

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:58.664
ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:58:58.731 --> 01:59:02.635
MISTER AND MISS SOMETHING. YOU

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.070
BROWN'S ACT. CAN YOU JUST STOP

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:05.338
BY THERE AND WE JUST MAKE THAT

01:59:05.404 --> 01:59:07.240
FORMAL REQUEST OF THE- BECAUSE

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:08.708
THIS IS NOT AN EASTER EGG HUNT

01:59:08.774 --> 01:59:10.776
HERE IF WE'VE GOT. IF THEY KNOW

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.411
THE COST PER TON ON ALL THESE

01:59:12.478 --> 01:59:14.113
ABA PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.681
LOOKING TO USE THE FEES WHICH

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.783
EVERYBODY PAYS TO REGISTER. TO

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:20.786
DO- ZEV CONSTRUCTION IN THE

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:22.121
ALLEY- AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF

01:59:22.188 --> 01:59:23.055
THE COMMITTEE AND THE

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:25.024
LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T BE. YOU

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:25.925
KNOW SHOULD WE SHOULD GET A

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:28.361
PRESENTATION SO WE KNOW BECAUSE

01:59:28.427 --> 01:59:30.496
WE'VE- I KNOW THAT THE L. A. O.

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:32.298
HAS INSTRUCTED THE LEGISLATURE

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:33.666
TO TRY TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG

01:59:33.733 --> 01:59:34.800
FOR THE BUCK ON THE MONEY THAT

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:36.035
WE'RE SPENDING. SO IF WE

01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:40.640
SECURITIZE. FUNDS AND WE-ALREADY HAVE FUNDS GOING FOR

01:59:40.706 --> 01:59:42.608
PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE. CARBON

01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:44.577
AND POLLUTION WHY WOULD WE WANT

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:45.511
TO DEFER TO A DIFFERENT AT

01:59:45.578 --> 01:59:47.179
LEAST AT LEAST LET US KNOW THAT

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:49.749
WE'RE MINDFUL BUT- IF. I CAN

01:59:49.815 --> 01:59:51.350
GET THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT AND

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:53.052
THE AIRPORT TO GIVE US THAT.

01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:54.854
THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:57.456
PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY YES WE

01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:59.992
WERE HAPPY TO KIND OF SUPPORT-YOU IN YOUR STUFF AND THEN

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:00.459
TRYING TO GATHER THAT

02:00:00.526 --> 02:00:02.461
INFORMATION. I'M WORKING WITH

02:00:02.528 --> 02:00:04.497
THE ADMINISTRATION- ABSENT KIND

02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:05.598
OF THAT NOT MORE CONCRETE

02:00:05.665 --> 02:00:07.500
INFORMATION THERE ARE. A

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:08.935
VARIETY OF FACTORS TO KIND OF

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:10.703
THINK ABOUT CONSIDER. ONE KIND

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:11.837
OF HOW IT HOW TO ALLOCATE

02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:13.306
FUNDING ACROSS PROGRAMS YOU

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.340
KNOW A COUPLE OF THEM FOR

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:15.274
EXAMPLE ARE KIND OF HOW TO

02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:16.809
EMPHASIZE LIGHT DUTY VERSUS

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:18.711
HEAVY DUTY- THEY'RE KIND OF

02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:20.880
DIFFERENT- PERCENTAGES. OF

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:21.981
OVERALL EMISSIONS AND

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:23.282
GREENHOUSE GASES VERSUS AIR

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:24.116
QUALITY THERE SORT OF A

02:00:24.183 --> 02:00:25.117
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE GETTING

02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:27.620
UPDATED VEHICLES- BALANCE IN

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:30.156
CERTAIN NEAR TERM- GOALS VERSUS

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:31.390
LONG TERM GOALS AND PART OF

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.025
THAT GETS INTO. UNLESS YOU WANT

02:00:33.092 --> 02:00:34.694
TO FOCUS ON KIND OF LONG TERM

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:38.030
DEBT REDUCTION GOALS- AND THEN-

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:39.231
THE ONE THAT- THE OTHER SORT

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.200
OF. I THINK YOU CONSIDERATION

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.435
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.236
ON IS THIS ISSUE OF HOW MUCH TO

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.205
FOCUS ON. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:49.275
VERSES VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND

02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:50.810
YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS PROGRAMS

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:55.648
THAT FOCUS ON BOTH- THE- BUDGET

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:57.583
PROPOSAL THIS YEAR AS HAS BEEN

02:00:57.650 --> 02:00:58.918
MENTIONED ALREADY DOESN'T

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.586
INCLUDE ANY NEW FUNDING FOR CVR

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.855
PIECE OTHERS- THERE'S MORE OF

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.123
AN EMPHASIS ON CONCEPT

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:05.825
INFRASTRUCTURE AT LEAST AS PART

02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:06.425
OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS

02:01:06.492 --> 02:01:08.995
YEAR. OUR VIEW IS IN GENERAL WE

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:10.963
THINK FOCUSING ON BOTH.

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:12.465
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.367
VEHICLE INCENTIVES MAKES. SENSE

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:15.134
AND THERE'S WE THINK THERE'S

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.535
SOME RESEARCH TO SUPPORT KIND

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.972
OF- POLICIES FOCUSING ON BOTH.

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.174
OUT WE DO THINK IF FUNDS ARE

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:23.709
LIMITED THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY

02:01:23.776 --> 02:01:24.877
HAVE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE DOES

02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:26.112
SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:27.513
PUSH HARD ON ONE THAT.

02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.015
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE A

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:31.550
HIGHER RIORITY THAN VEHICLES

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.853
BUT- NO REASON YOU KNOW THAT.

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:34.987
THE RESURGENT SORT OF ENTIRELY

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.355
CONCLUSIVE IN THIS AREA AND I

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.523
THINK REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.025
DISAGREE BUT WE DO THINK OF A

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.393
FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE DOES

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:41.127
HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AND

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:42.628
SOPHIA'S. IN MINISTRATIONS SORT

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.130
OF- PROPOSAL FOCUS ON

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:46.132
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS. HAS SOME

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:54.273
MERIT. FINALLY. I'M ON THE

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.842
ACCELERATE PLEASE- THE SEVEN

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:57.810
FOR SURE FROM. REALLY SORT OF.

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.012
WE VIEW IT AS AN EX. OF FUNDING.

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:00.780
IT WOULD BE A IN FUTURE YEAR

02:02:00.846 --> 02:02:03.015
AND SO- INSTEAD SORT OF- HAVE

02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:03.749
ANNUAL FUND AVAIL FOR SO FOR

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:05.284
SURE. OVER THE COUPLE OF

02:02:05.351 --> 02:02:06.652
DECADES. YOU KNOW A BOND WOULD

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.220
BE ISSUED UP TO A ONE BILLION

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:10.690
DOLLAR BONDS- TO ACCELERATE

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:11.824
THAT MONEY FORWARD AND HAVE

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.459
THAT AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT FEW

02:02:13.526 --> 02:02:16.195
YEARS- AND AS A RESULT THE

02:02:16.262 --> 02:02:18.297
STATE WOULD BE PAYING DEBT

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:21.167
SERVICE. OF UP TO. ABOUT SIXTY

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:22.334
SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

02:02:22.401 --> 02:02:23.335
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:25.471
AND SO. ARE WE ARE NOT NOT NOT

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:26.806
AS MUCH AS SORT OF AN INCREASE

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.474
AS AS MUCH AS THAT KIND OF

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:30.576
SHIFT- AN ACCELERATION OF THE

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.878
FUNDING FORWARD- WE AND WE

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:34.146
THINK THERE IS SOME MERIT- KIND

02:02:34.213 --> 02:02:35.581
OF THAT. APPROACH THERE IS AN

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:37.717
IDENTIFIED. GAP IN FUNDING OVER

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:39.285
THE NEXT FEW YEARS I WOULD

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:41.153
THINK THE FUNDING SOURCE

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.355
REVENUE SOURCE OF RELATIVELY

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:43.923
STABLE SO IT'S A REASONABLE

02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:46.926
SOURCE TO USE- TO ISSUE BONDS.

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:48.194
TRADE OFF WAITING FOR THE

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.629
LEGISLATURE IS JUST TO- ON

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:52.298
BALANCE THE ABOUT SHORT TERM

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:53.766
INCREASE IN FUNDING WEST OUT

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:55.401
LONG TERM DECREASE IN FUNDING

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:57.002
AS THE STATE HAS TO MAKE THOSE

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.938
DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS. IN

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:01.474
FUTURE YEARS- AND YOU KNOW

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.675
WHETHER THE SORT OF SHORT TERM

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:03.976
MARKET DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.277
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS OR WERE

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:07.079
SORT OF LESS FUNDING AVAILABLE

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:08.514
IN FUTURE YEARS AND SO THE

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:10.216
COMMITTEE WANT MY ONCE A-

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:11.350
EXPLORE OF THE ADMINISTRATION

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:12.685
DURING THE HEARING ABOUT WHAT

02:03:12.752 --> 02:03:13.953
THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:15.521
LONG TERM FUNDING NEEDS BECAUSE

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:17.556
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- A LOT OF

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:19.291
THAT. A LARGE CHUNK OF THE

02:03:19.358 --> 02:03:20.860
FUNDING ON ENERGY COMMISSION

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.061
COULD BE- NEEDED TO PAY DEBT

02:03:22.128 --> 02:03:23.429
SERVICE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:24.396
YEARS OF ONE BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:27.666
PROJECT. RIGHT NOW I WILL. TRY

02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:29.368
TO IN MY- THERE I DO WANT TO WE

02:03:29.435 --> 02:03:31.170
HAVE A OF OTHER RECOMMEND.

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:32.505
RELATED TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:33.472
DOES WANT TO ADOPT THE

CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS JUST

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:45.484
A HEALTH INSURER. BUT THERE IS

02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:46.619
ONGOING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

02:03:46.685 --> 02:03:52.658

ANNOUNCED CHARGING STATIONS

WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. BUT WE

02:04:06.939 --> 02:04:09.308
STILL HAVE A SENSE OF. FUNDS

THE AYE YOU'LL USE YOUR

SECTOR IS DOING WHAT'S YOUR

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:20.419
SENSE OF. WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:04:20.486 --> 02:04:22.488
RIGHT NOW ON THE NATURAL THAT

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:25.090
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DONE- ON

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:27.359
THE CONSTRUCTION OF- OF FIVE

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:28.928
STEPS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS.

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:31.564
LONG TERM SHORT TERM- A BED AND

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:35.367
SET THAT MONEY HAS. TO BE SPENT

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:35.935
RIGHT WE HAVE THE- BORDERS.

02:04:36.001 --> 02:04:37.403
NEGOTIATED A GREAT DEAL WITH

02:04:37.469 --> 02:04:41.173
SOFTWARE. YEAH THERE YOU'RE

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.374
RIGHT THAT THERE ARE NONE OF

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:43.309
ALL THESE OTHER SORT OF

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:45.678
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON-

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:46.879
AS MISS MONAGHAN MET

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.480
COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN MENTIONED

02:04:48.547 --> 02:04:51.116
I THINK THERE'S- THE KIND OF

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.918
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU DOES KIND

02:04:52.985 --> 02:04:53.886
OF INCORPORATE WHAT

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:55.554
EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT HOW

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:58.824
MANY- CHARGING STATIONS- AND

02:04:58.891 --> 02:04:59.825
PORTS WILL BE SORT OF

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:01.927
CONSTRUCTED WITH THOSE FUNDS OR

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.028
THE FUNDING KIND OF UNDER THIS

02:05:03.095 --> 02:05:04.396
PROPOSAL WOULD BE USED TO KIND

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.398
OF IDENTIFY THE GAPS. BETWEEN

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.266
WHAT WHAT WOULD BE PROVIDED

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.335
WITH THOSE FUNDS AND WHAT'S

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:10.769
NEEDED TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.271
GOVERNOR IS LAID OUT IN TERMS

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:14.874
OF INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN I

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.442
THINK I THERE ARE SORT OF VERY

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:18.477
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT- IN

02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:20.045
THE LONG TERM WHAT IS THE

02:05:20.112 --> 02:05:22.314
STATE'S. ROLLING KIND OF HOW

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:23.582
MUCH STATE SUPPORT WILL BE

02:05:23.649 --> 02:05:25.317
NEEDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:26.285
THINK THERE IS KIND OF AN

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:27.786
EXPECTATION THAT AS THE MARKET

02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:29.855
DEVELOPS THEN IT MIGHT BE LESS

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:31.123
OF A NEED FOR STATE SUPPORT AT

02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:32.658
THE PRIVATE MARKET WILL TAKE

02:05:32.725 --> 02:05:34.927
OVER A LARGE CHUNK OF IT- BUT I

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:36.595
THINK OF IT AS IT KIND OF COMES

02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:37.663
TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT LONG

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:39.465
TERM FUNDING NEEDS MIGHT BE

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:41.166
THERE ARE STILL ARE SOME OTHER.

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:42.902
A BIG PIECES THAT IT'S STILL

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:45.571
UNCLEAR- EXACTLY HOW MUCH STATE

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.239
SUPPORT AND I THINK THERE'S A

02:05:47.306 --> 02:05:48.207
PRETTY STRONG ARGUMENT TO SOME

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:49.642
STATE SUPPORT MIGHT BE NEEDED

02:05:49.708 --> 02:05:52.745
FOR EXAMPLE FOR MULTI FAMILY-

02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:55.381
HOUSING- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:56.348
KIND OF YOU KNOW PRIVATE

02:05:56.415 --> 02:05:57.750
MARKETABILITY OF THE KIND OF

02:05:57.816 --> 02:05:59.084
THE PRIVATE MARKET TO PROVIDE

02:05:59.151 --> 02:05:59.685
THAT WE THINK THERE ARE SOME

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:00.819
KIND OF SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.021
AND SO THERE MIGHT BE A KIND OF

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:03.055
A CONTINUED STATE ROLE FOR

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:05.491
THAT. ARE HEAVY DUTY AND FOR

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:07.126
STRUCTURE IS KIND OF A GROWING

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:08.694
EASTON VERY EXPENSIVE I KNOW

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.429
THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS SOME

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:11.664
SOME ESTIMATES ON KIND OF WHAT

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:13.766
THE NEEDS MIGHT BE THERE SO-

02:06:13.832 --> 02:06:14.833
YEAH THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING

02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.235
ON BUT I THINK THERE'S JUST

02:06:16.302 --> 02:06:17.536
GIVEN SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE

02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:18.337
LEAST SOME OF THE GOALS OF THE

02:06:18.404 --> 02:06:19.939
GOVERNOR HAS ESTABLISHED

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:22.541
THERE'S- YOU KNOW A LOT MORE

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:23.542
AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE OVER

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:29.114
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. YEAH IT

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:30.783
JUST WOULDN'T. I DON'T WANT TO

02:06:30.849 --> 02:06:31.517
SOUND LIKE A- RECORD ABOUT TWO.

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:34.153
TO BEEF UP THE- AND TRADE

02:06:34.219 --> 02:06:35.387
PROGRAMS THAT A PERFORMANCE

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:36.455
BETTER. AND CREATES MORE

02:06:36.522 --> 02:06:37.957
REVENUE AND IF WE'RE TALKING.

02:06:38.023 --> 02:06:39.959
YOU KNOW AT THE END GAME IS TWO

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:40.793
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:06:40.859 --> 02:06:42.928
PER YEAR. THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.129
BEEFING UP THAT THAT NEEDS TO

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:46.332
BE DONE. THAT THIS IS A TWO

02:06:46.398 --> 02:06:48.133
THIRDS VOTE IT'S A IT'S A-

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:50.202
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN. HOW THE

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.304
FUNDING GOES FROM. THE PROGRAMS

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:54.540
FOR REGISTRATION FEE SO IT'S-

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:57.142
A- I THE HOPE THAT WE ALL LOOK

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:58.777
AT ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:00.879
OF FEAR. IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:03.682
THIS- THIS STEP BECAUSE- YES.

02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:05.351
IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET CHARGING

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:07.720
STATIONS AT. AT APARTMENT

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:09.421
COMPLEXES IT'S EQUALLY AS

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:10.289
IMPORTANT TO GET THOSE

02:07:10.356 --> 02:07:12.091
APARTMENT APARTMENT COMPLEXES

02:07:12.157 --> 02:07:14.793
ENERGY EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.862
MAY BE. ARE SPROUTING UP MORE

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:18.564
POLLUTION AND MORE GREENHOUSE

02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:21.200
GASES THAN THE DELTA IS SO

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.334
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS BE DONE

02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:23.602
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THINGS

02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:25.604
SENATOR STERN. YOUR QUESTION

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:27.339
YES THANKS MISCARRIAGE WANT TO

02:07:27.406 --> 02:07:29.475
FOLLOW UP ON YOUR- INQUIRY AND

02:07:29.541 --> 02:07:30.776
I GUESS CAN WE DRILL DOWN A

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.478
LITTLE FURTHER THAN. WHAT

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:33.779
WHAT'S THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:35.814
LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW FROM THE

02:07:35.881 --> 02:07:37.816
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE.

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:40.819
ON THE SORT OF. TO REACH THE

02:07:40.886 --> 02:07:41.954
GOALS THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT.

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.356
WHAT WHAT'S THE SORT OF ALL IN

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:47.092
NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:47.693
FAR WILL THIS PROPOSAL GET US

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:52.931
THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:55.300
QUESTION- STERN. SO OUR

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:58.670
ANALYSIS- SPUR OF THE CHAPTER

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.973
BOARD THAT FOR AB TWENTY ONE

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:01.840
TWENTY SEVEN WHICH REQUIRES US

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:05.444
ON A BIANNUAL BASIS TO LOOK AT-

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:06.879
THAT WHETHER WE'RE MEETING OUR

02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:09.181
GOALS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:12.785
WHAT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT FOR

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:14.753
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE SIXTY

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.088
THOUSAND CHARGERS SHORT OF OUR

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:17.489
GOAL AND WE'RE TWENTY ONE

02:08:17.556 --> 02:08:20.692
HYDROGEN STATIONS SHORT OF OUR

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:21.860
GOAL OF- TWO HUNDRED STATIONS.

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:24.096
SO THERE IS A GAP AND THAT

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:26.698
ANNOUNCER STRUCTURE ACCOUNT.

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:27.733
ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.968
COULD COLLECT IN TERMS OF-

02:08:30.035 --> 02:08:32.237
INVESTMENTS BY UTILITIES AND BY

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:34.173
ELECTRIFY AMERICA OTHER

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:36.275
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS- AND WE

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:38.944
STILL HAVE THAT DELTA. SO WHAT

02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:41.680
WE WOULD USE OUR- BONTA SPORTY

02:08:41.747 --> 02:08:42.981
DO THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:44.983
BILLION IS TO FILL THAT GAP WE

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.951
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:47.486
CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO MEET

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:49.521
OUR SHORT TERM TWENTY TWENTY

02:08:49.588 --> 02:08:51.056
FIVE GOAL WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:54.126
OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OUR

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:55.894
OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT I MEAN

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:59.765
AT THIS POINT INFRASTRUCTURE IS.

02:08:59.832 --> 02:09:02.101
ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST BARRIER I

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:04.169
MEAN I THINK THAT- RIGHT THE

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:06.071
BATTERIES IN PARTICULAR HAS

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.372
FALLEN BY 90% OVER THE LAST

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.909
DECADE. MANY ARTICLES ARE ON

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:13.445
TRACK TO BE CHEAPER ON A COST

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.214
BASIS AND THEIR INTERNAL

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.381
COMBUSTION COUNTERPARTS OVER

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:18.851
THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS. AND

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:21.854
SO NOW- THE BARRIER IS WILL I

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:22.921
LIVE IN APARTMENT BUILDING I

02:09:22.988 --> 02:09:23.856
DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CHARGE MY

02:09:23.922 --> 02:09:25.390
VEHICLE I'M NOT GOING TO GET AS

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:26.158
THEIR MISSION YES- I WOULD

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:28.660
ARGUE- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:09:28.727 --> 02:09:30.896
THAT. NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:32.764
YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

02:09:32.831 --> 02:09:35.267
MACHINE VEHICLE. AND PART OF

02:09:35.334 --> 02:09:36.668
THE INCENTIVE FOR THIS HONESTLY

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:38.103
IS THAT THESE VEHICLES ON A

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:39.571
LIFE CYCLE BASIS FOR CHEAPER

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:42.241
SO. CONSUMER EPORTS FOUND THAT

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:44.076
THESE VEHICLES ARE SAFE

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:48.247
CONSUMERS- ELEVEN HUNDRED TO

02:09:48.313 --> 02:09:48.847
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:53.752
YEAR ON REDUCE YOUR MAINTENANCE.

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:54.353
COSTS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:55.187
THAT. EVERYBODY CAN BENEFIT

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:56.321
FROM THAT JUST PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:56.855
IN SINGLE FAMILY HOME BUT

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.358
EVERYTHING. IN IN SEARCH JUST

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:00.626
FOLLOWING UP ON THAT POINT I

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:01.527
MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:03.428
CLIMATE CATALYST. A LITTLE

02:10:03.495 --> 02:10:05.297
EARLIER AND SORT OF LEVERAGING

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:07.866
IN FINANCE SO IF YOU WENT WITH

02:10:07.933 --> 02:10:08.734
THE STREET SORT OF CASH

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:11.336
APPROACH. VERSES THIS.

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:13.205
FINANCING APPROACHES BEEN POSED

02:10:13.272 --> 02:10:16.074

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.208
CATALYST UNCERTAINTIES POLICY

02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:25.444
EXTERNALITIES THAT MAY LIMIT

02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:27.546
YOU KNOW YOU GOT MONEY BUT

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:28.447

WAY TOO AND I YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:11:30.582 --> 02:11:32.451
YOUR YOUR PLANNING PROCESS AND

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:33.785
SOME OF THE GOALS YOU'VE SET

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.320
OUT ON SAY SIXTY THOUSAND A

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:36.822
YEAR OR TRYING TO HIT THAT TWO

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:39.925
HUNDRED HYDROGEN A YEAR- I

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:41.860
DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S IT C. E. C.

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:43.295
OR IF IT'S IF THIS IS MORE OF

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:44.796
LIKE A GO BUSINESS QUESTION.

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:47.933
BUT THE CENTRAL PLANNING

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.268
FUNCTION AND SORT OF

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:50.569
STREAMLINING THE

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:53.538
INFRASTRUCTURE. IT SEEMS LIKE.

02:11:53.605 --> 02:11:55.240
AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW LIKE ACTUAL

02:11:55.307 --> 02:11:56.408
THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION

02:11:56.475 --> 02:11:58.744
TIMELINE FOR GETTING. THESE

02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:00.045
DIFFERENT STATIONS ARE CHARGING

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:02.114
OPERATIONS BUILT. HITS ALL

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:04.650
KINDS OF IMPEDIMENTS NOT

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:08.353
UNIFORM. LOCAL MUNICIPAL CODES-

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.255
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT INFORMATION

02:12:10.322 --> 02:12:13.525
ABOUT WHAT FIRE MARSHAL NEEDS

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:16.595
ARE- UNDERGROUNDING ISSUES SO

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:18.530
IS THERE IS THERE SORT OF.

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:20.732
COROLLARY EFFORT THAT MATCHES

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:23.702
WITH THIS FINANCING PROPOSAL TO

02:12:23.769 --> 02:12:25.003
LOOK AT WHAT THE POLICY

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:27.372
BARRIERS ARE AND TRY TO HAVE

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:29.074
SOME LEADERSHIP AT THE

02:12:29.141 --> 02:12:32.177
GOVERNOR'S LEVEL TO LIKE. TO

02:12:32.244 --> 02:12:36.581
REALLY DRIVE THIS FORWARD. I'M

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:38.317
NOT SURE IF THEY CAN I CAN

02:12:38.383 --> 02:12:40.285
SPEAK ON BEHALF OF COPAYS YEAH

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:42.721
AT LEAST IT ASSEMBLY NOT OKAY

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:44.323
SO GOOD OKAY. YEAH DEVELOP AND

02:12:44.389 --> 02:12:46.591
THAT STRATEGY THEY HAVE

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.593
DEVELOPED A STRATEGY- IN

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:52.731
CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:53.332
AND WITH AGENCIES. THERE ARE

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:54.066
BARRIERS YOU POINT OUT AT THE

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:56.134
LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S JUST.

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:57.402
STREAMLINING THAT NEEDS TO

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.771
HAPPEN SO THAT THAT THE-

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:00.806
PROJECT CAN HAPPEN MORE

02:13:00.872 --> 02:13:03.375
QUICKLY. AND TO GO BEEN HAS A

02:13:03.442 --> 02:13:04.409
PERMANENT OLYMPICS WHERE

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:05.911
THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO CREATE

02:13:05.977 --> 02:13:07.879
YOU KNOW IT IT JUST SPREAD THE

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:08.980
KNOWLEDGE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:13:09.047 --> 02:13:11.483
THAT THIS ISN'T A PAIR THAT

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:12.984
NEED TO BE OVERCOME. AND YOU

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:16.855
KNOW THIS. CHANGE THAT WE ARE-

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:18.390
WE'RE SPEAKING IT'S GOING TO

02:13:18.457 --> 02:13:21.193
TAKE ACTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:22.594
AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE

02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:25.330
FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THERE ARE

02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.631
BARRIERS ALONG THE WAY IT

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:29.301
MIGHT. MY SENSE IS THAT THESE

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:31.737
BARRIERS ARE ALL SURMOUNTABLE-

02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:33.805
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF. WORKING

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:36.375
TOGETHER AND SO GOBIZ IS REALLY

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:37.442
THE POINT FOR THAT. THAT

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.411
STRATEGY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:41.780
SIDE THE CDC IS REALLY THE

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:42.714
POINT FOR THAT AND THAT'S

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.182
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE YOU

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:46.585
HAVE GIVEN US THAT AUTHORITY.

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:47.719
BUT I WANT TO SAY THE RECORDS

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:50.489
THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT AB

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:51.022
TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ON

02:13:51.089 --> 02:13:51.823
WHETHER WE'RE ATTRACTED MEET

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.925
OUR GOALS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:55.827
AND THAT THE ALBUM REPORT THAT

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:57.129
REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT EQUITY

02:13:57.195 --> 02:13:59.030
IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CHARTER

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:01.333
DISTRIBUTION. THE OTHER

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.902
CRITICAL ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE

02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:05.937
USING TO INFORM AND TAYLOR ARE

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:08.573
INVESTMENTS. AND I MEAN I THINK

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.242
IT IN TERMS OF HOLDING US

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:12.310
ACCOUNTABLE YOU HAVE GIVEN US

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:15.347
TOOLS. TO TO HOLD OUR

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:16.481
INVESTMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO

02:14:16.548 --> 02:14:17.549
WHETHER WE ARE MEETING OUR

02:14:17.616 --> 02:14:22.053
GOALS AND WHETHER WE'RE GETTING.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.054
JUST AND EQUITABLE WAY. IT'S

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:23.755
ZERO POINT YOU'RE NOT ON TRACK

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:24.623
TO MEET THOSE GOALS THAT WE'VE

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:27.826
ASKED YOU TO MEET. AND THIS IS

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:34.132
THE STOP GAP. THE FIRST FIVE

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:34.733
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:37.269
BE USED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:37.836
NEED OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

02:14:37.903 --> 02:14:40.038
GOALS. AND THE SECOND FIVE

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.106
HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE SENT TO

02:14:41.173 --> 02:14:44.309
SET US ON COURSE FOR TWENTY

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:44.943
THIRTY. BUT I EXPECT HIM INSIDE

02:14:45.010 --> 02:14:46.711
ENOUGH THAT OUR GOAL IS YOU

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:48.079
KNOW HOW EVENTUALLY WANT TO GET

02:14:48.146 --> 02:14:49.414
RID OF THE PUBLIC WE DON'T WANT

02:14:49.481 --> 02:14:50.615
PUBLIC DOLLARS GOING TO THE-

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:53.418
MARKET TO TAKE OVER. AND BUT

02:14:53.485 --> 02:14:55.487
THE MARKET ISN'T. DRIVING IT

02:14:55.554 --> 02:14:56.254
BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN'T

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:57.355
ENOUGH ELECTRIC VEHICLES OUT

02:14:57.422 --> 02:14:59.724
THERE. THE WINNER IS- ANOTHER

02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:01.326
SELECTIVE VEHICLE YOU KNOW

02:15:01.393 --> 02:15:02.594
ENOUGH ABOUT STOCKTON ELECTRIC

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:04.496
VEHICLE. CHARGING PROVIDERS

02:15:04.563 --> 02:15:06.198
WILL MAKE MONEY AND WE DON'T

02:15:06.264 --> 02:15:06.998
WANT TO KEEP FUNDING THEM.

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:08.333
THERE MAY ALWAYS BE A ROLE I

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.468
THINK FOR SOME PUBLIC

02:15:09.534 --> 02:15:10.769
INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:13.405
OUR- ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SO

02:15:13.472 --> 02:15:15.307
PUBLIC ENEMY DRAWINGS AND LOW

02:15:15.373 --> 02:15:16.241
INCOME DISADVANTAGED

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:16.975
COMMUNITIES NORTHERN

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:18.577
COMMUNITIES FOR ALL COMMUNITIES

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:19.878
LIKE THERE'S- THERE ARE PLACES

02:15:19.945 --> 02:15:24.349
WHERE. WE MAY NEED TO INVEST

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:26.084
FOR A LONGER PERIOD. SO THE

02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:27.319
FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS IT THE

02:15:27.385 --> 02:15:30.555
SHOULD. COMMITTEE OTHER. THAT

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:31.089
BUILT THE OLD CLICHE WE'RE

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:32.057
GOING TO AT THE LOW HANGING.

02:15:32.123 --> 02:15:34.125
THAT'S OUT THERE SO IF YOU GO

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:35.794
TO CITY. PICKLE RIVERA AND THEY

02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:40.098
SAY WE GOT. ONE TWO THREE FOUR

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:40.699
FIVE NINETY NINE NINETY EIGHT

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:41.333
LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT YOU HAVE

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:43.668
TO MEET. YOU SAY SIERRA AND YOU

02:15:43.735 --> 02:15:45.604
GO DOWN TO THE NEXT TOWN AND

02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:47.372
THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:48.139
CONDITIONS WE WANT TO WORK

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:50.475
WITH. WITH THE CDC AND GULBIS

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:53.812
TO PUT THIS IN. IF THE GOAL IS

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:54.346
TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT

02:15:54.412 --> 02:15:56.982
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE LOO.

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:58.383
THE AREAS THAT ARE. MAKE IT.

02:15:58.450 --> 02:16:00.785
INVITING FOR CHARGING STATIONS

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.120
AND HYDROGEN STATIONS GO WIN

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:04.155
INSTEAD OF SAYING OH NO WE

02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:05.991
WANTED IN. CENTER WILL CAL SKIS

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:07.726
DISTRICT AND WILL SPEND TWELVE

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:09.761
YEARS GOING THROUGH. PERMITTING

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:11.296
AND PLANNING WITH THAT WITH THE

02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:13.098
CITY THAT. THAT IS.

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:15.233
UNBELIEVABLE AND WE ARE WE ALL

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:17.068
KNOW. WE ARE CERTAIN LOCAL

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:19.938
GOVERNMENTS SO WE- HAVE AN IDEA

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:22.474
CENTER DOLLY. I REALLY DON'T

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:24.042
HAVE A QUESTION I JUST MORE OF

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:26.244
A COMET- MAYBE FOR THE

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:27.412
LEGISLATORS IN JUST MY OWN

02:16:27.479 --> 02:16:29.481
PERSONAL. FEEL GOOD TO SAY YOU

02:16:29.548 --> 02:16:31.516
KNOW THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:33.852
IS DOING THE SAME THING. ANNEX

02:16:33.919 --> 02:16:35.654
IS NOT CHANGING AND GETTING THE

02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:37.656
SAME OUTCOME- BECAUSE WHAT'S

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:39.624
YOUR NUMBER NUMBER ONE THAT

02:16:39.691 --> 02:16:41.593
THIS IS ALLOWING THE C. C. TO

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:42.994
SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:16:43.061 --> 02:16:45.564
WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE

02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:46.064
OVERSIGHT THE FUTURE THE

02:16:46.131 --> 02:16:47.632
SENATOR JUST. THE REASON WHY

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:49.000
COUNTY JUST MENTION SOME OF HIS

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:51.136
FRUSTRATIONS WITH. THE PROGRAMS

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:52.237
AND HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED SO

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:53.171
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:54.272
WE DEFINITELY SHOULD TAKE A

02:16:54.339 --> 02:16:55.974
LOOK AT THAT GIVES US SOME

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.475
ABILITY TO COME BACK AND

02:16:57.542 --> 02:16:59.578
SCRUTINIZED. HOW THIS MONEY IS

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:01.646
BEING SENT SPENT NUMBER ONE.

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:05.550
NUMBER TWO. WE'D WE- AGAIN A IN

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:06.985
THE IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS WAS

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:10.021
TALKED ABOUT. NO 80% AN AUCTION

02:17:10.088 --> 02:17:11.823
95% OF. DIESEL PARTICULATES

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:15.060
COME. BUT WE DON'T EVEN COUNT

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:15.994
AND I'M GO BACK TO THIS I'M

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.495
GONNA KEEP AFTER IT UNTIL MAYBE

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.396
SUNDAY IT ACTUALLY GETS

02:17:18.463 --> 02:17:19.631
QUALIFIED AND I HAVE A

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:20.932
LEGISLATION TO DO THAT THIS

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:23.401
YEAR. WE DON'T COUNT ALL THE

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:25.136
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU

02:17:25.203 --> 02:17:27.439
TALK ABOUT AIR QUALITY WE BURN

02:17:27.505 --> 02:17:28.273
FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.008
LAST YEAR AND MILLIONS OF ACRES

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.477
IN THE YEARS BEFORE. AND WE

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:34.045
DON'T COUNT THOSE IN OUR CARBON

02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:36.014
EMISSIONS. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:38.049
BEING INSANE I KEEP TALKING

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:39.484
ABOUT DO WE HAVE IF WE REALLY

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.986
CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND

02:17:41.052 --> 02:17:42.721
WE REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR CARBON

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.357
OUTPUT. THEN WE WOULD COUNT ALL

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:47.659
THE CARBON THAT WE PUT OUT. AND

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:49.828
YOU KNOW THE FOREST HAS BEEN

02:17:49.894 --> 02:17:52.230
MANIPULATED BY US. THE NATIVE

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:55.133
AMERICANS AND GOD ALMIGHTY WITH

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:57.268
LIGHTNING MANAGED ARE FORCED

02:17:57.335 --> 02:17:58.370
BEFORE WE CAME ALONG AND MESSED

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:01.406
IT UP. WE SUPPRESS FIRE FOR THE

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:03.475
LAST ALMOST HUNDRED YEARS. AND

02:18:03.541 --> 02:18:06.378
WE HAVE A FORCED IT'S OVER WELL

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:08.847
AND WITH FUEL AND IT'S

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:10.415
CATASTROPHICALLY BERNIE ON TOP

02:18:10.482 --> 02:18:13.685
OF. OUR CLIMB IS CHANGING WE

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:16.621
HAVE LATER SNOW MORE RAIN AND

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:19.190
WIND AND DRYER SEASON SO I JUST

02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:21.192
WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT.

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:22.761
INTEL WE REALLY TALK ABOUT THE

02:18:22.827 --> 02:18:25.864
ENVIRONMENT IN ITS TOTALITY. IN

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.565
ANY AND WHEN WE DO WE GO ON

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:29.401
HERE WE'RE GONNA TAX THE TWENTY

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:30.835
THREE YEAR IS EXTENDING A FEE

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:32.804
IN TAX TWENTY THREE YEARS.

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:34.639
WE'RE GONNA FRONT LOAD IT TO

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:37.442
PAY OFF WHAT THE GOAL WAS HALF

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:40.278
A BILLION TO PAY THE GOAL. FOR

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:40.879
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH WE'VE

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:44.115
ALREADY SET AND NOW UNDER.

02:18:44.182 --> 02:18:44.716
RIGHT BECAUSE HE SAID NOBODY

02:18:44.783 --> 02:18:45.517
TALKS TO US YOUR BE A

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:47.819
REPUBLICAN AROUND HERE. I MEAN

02:18:47.886 --> 02:18:49.354
TALK ABOUT NOBODY TALKING TO

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:51.222
YOU. IS THIS IS THIS IS MY

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:52.557
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:18:52.624 --> 02:18:53.224
THINGS I CARE ABOUT THAT I

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:54.859
THINK WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT.

02:18:54.926 --> 02:18:57.028
BECAUSE IN THE POLICY

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:57.595
DISCUSSIONS WE DON'T WE GET

02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:00.198
LEFT BEHIND AND- THEN IT SEEMS

02:19:00.265 --> 02:19:01.866
LIKE WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON. YOU

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.168
KNOW MORE LIKE TWO CARS WE HAVE

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:05.403
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GET YOU

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:05.937
CAN PUT EVERY YOU CAN MAKE

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:08.039
EVERY SINGLE. VEHICLE IN

02:19:08.106 --> 02:19:10.442
CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC AND WE CAN

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:11.476
STILL HAVE A CARBON OUTPUT

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:12.777
PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:14.379
COUNTING EVERYTHING SO I JUST

02:19:14.446 --> 02:19:15.714
WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR I

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:16.681
KNOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS

02:19:16.748 --> 02:19:18.216
HAVE HEARD IT. THE LAST TIME

02:19:18.283 --> 02:19:19.617
I'VE BEEN HERE. BUT ON THIS DAY

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:20.719
AFTER DAY UNTIL WE ACTUALLY

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:22.253
QUANTIFY IT AND WE DO IT RIGHT

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:24.789
BECAUSE I DO TRULY CARE. ABOUT

02:19:24.856 --> 02:19:28.593
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S JUST

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:29.194
FRUSTRATING TWO OTHER THINGS I

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:30.795
WANT TO MENTION. NUMBER ONE WE

02:19:30.862 --> 02:19:32.630
HAVE NO RECYCLING PLANT FOR ALL

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:35.834
THESE EV'S. N. N. N. SOLAR

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:37.702
PANELS THAT WHEN THERE'S LIFE

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:39.504
IS SPENT WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:41.806
THEM AND THAT AND THAT AND I

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:44.075
RAN A BILL TWO YEARS AGO. THAT

02:19:44.142 --> 02:19:46.611
THAT FORCED THE- ADMINISTRATOR

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:49.581
NOT TO MENTION THE DEPARTMENT.

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:50.548
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:52.584
RECYCLING BATTERIES WE DON'T WE

02:19:52.650 --> 02:19:54.486
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE HAZARDOUS.

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:55.787
IF ONE OF THESE GOES INTO IT

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:56.921
GETS IN AN ACCIDENT AND GOES

02:19:56.988 --> 02:19:58.623
INTO RIVER WHAT THE TOXICITY OF

02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:00.091
IT IS THAT OUTPUTS RIGHT THEN

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.860
SO I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON.

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:04.496
YOUR BATTERIES RECYCLING AND

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:06.164
WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:08.233
THAT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE AND

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:09.067
THE OTHER THING I THINK WE

02:20:09.134 --> 02:20:11.236
SHOULD FOCUS ON. TO IS THE

02:20:11.302 --> 02:20:12.270
RECYCLING OF SOLAR PANELS

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:13.438
THERE'S A LOT OF THE SOLAR

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:14.405
PANELS OUT THERE THAT THEIR

02:20:14.472 --> 02:20:16.174
LIFESPAN IS COMING UP AND

02:20:16.241 --> 02:20:19.210
THERE'S BEEN NO BONDS. NO NO WE

02:20:19.277 --> 02:20:20.879
HAVE NO WAY TO GO OUT AND-

02:20:20.945 --> 02:20:22.413
QUANTIFY HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.349
THEM THIS IS THIS ISN'T. GOING

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:26.451
TO BE JUST LIKE. MINES WE HAVE

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:28.386
I HAD TO HAVE A SUIT ACIDIC

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:30.388
MINE AN INCH SHASTA COUNTY

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:36.161
INTO. THE RIVER FOR YEARS AND

02:20:36.227 --> 02:20:36.761

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:37.662
GONNA SEE THE SAME THING WITH

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:39.164

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:40.265
THESE COMPANIES OR AWAY.

02:20:40.331 --> 02:20:41.800

TALKED ABOUT- BUT WE THINK THE

02:35:33.123 --> 02:35:33.791
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

02:35:33.857 --> 02:35:35.292
CONSIDER ADDING A REQUIREMENT

02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:36.126
THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION

02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:38.896

BEFORE THE AWARD WOULD JUST ADD

A LITTLE ADDITIONAL KIND OF

02:35:50.441 --> 02:35:51.709
OVERSIGHT BEFORE THE MONEY IS

02:35:51.775 --> 02:35:53.877
ACTUALLY ALLOCATED AND- THIS

02:35:53.944 --> 02:35:54.745
COULD BE SIMILAR TO THERE'S AN

02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:56.980
EXISTING. JAIL BC NOTIFICATION

02:35:57.047 --> 02:35:59.183

AN EXEMPTION TO THE REQUIREMENT

02:36:04.288 --> 02:36:06.123
FOR COMPETITIVE BIDS AND SO THE

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:07.658
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDERING

02:36:07.725 --> 02:36:09.026
