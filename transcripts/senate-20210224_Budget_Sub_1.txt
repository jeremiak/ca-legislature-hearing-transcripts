THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WAS VERY TO. VIEW TO. THE PRESIDENT DOWN WITH ABOUT BUT IN YOUR LIST OF THINGS- MISTER STEWART DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS I KNOW THIS FROM COMMON. THANK YOU AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE OHIO. HI JASON CONCENTRA CELILO I'M IN MY TESTIMONY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS THE FIRST IS TO TALK ABOUT BY HASTINGS OVERALL ON FINDING AND FUNDING BY SOURCE THE SECOND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS HASTINGS UP PLANS TO SPEND THE IT'S SIMON DISSIPATING FUNDING INCREASES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE THIRD IS TO PROVIDE OUR THOUGHTS ON THESE MATTERS SO STARTING ON THE FIRST ISSUE- I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION. TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR AGENDA- WHICH HAS WHY AND FIGURE ONE- SHE HE'S- ON COURT BY. AND THE KEY AWAYS WITH FIGURE IS THAT HE INTO A FOR INCREASE OF SIXTY A HALF NOW. IN THE BY YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THE JOHN FUND ON. DESCRIBED BY THE MINISTRY. HE SINGS IS ALL- ANTICIPATE. OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN TUITION FEAR OF. AS IT MISSED ARE NO. UNDER THIS FOR HAS TO WERE NOT INCREASED CHOI FIRST AND- THIS REVENUE GROW IS JOE. FOR BY AND WILL GROWTH ARE YOU CAN SEE IN THE TO. HE STINGS. A NINE AND A HALF PERCENT INCREASE THE MOMENT IN THE BUDGET. AFTER THE SECOND ISSUE HOW WOULD HE SING SPELL THIS ONE. IN I WOULD DIRECTOR TO PAY. THREE YOUR AGENDA THAT LAST. WHICH PROVIDE. A NARRATIVE SOME OF HOW SINGS WITH ITS ON- THE KEY TAKE AWAY. IS THAT TWO POINT NINE. OF THIS CARE. WOULD GO TO SUPPORT A BASIC WORKLOAD BUDGET. CONSISTING OF THINGS LIKE EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES WOULD COVER OPERATING COSTS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. AND THEN THE REMAINING THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE SCHOOL TO ADDRESS ITS BUDGET DEFICIT. AND ON THIS LATTER POINT- THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS HERE- HE STANDS IN SUCH A PAGE TO ELIMINATE ITS DEFICIT. I THAT HAD EXIST PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. I'M IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND ACTUALLY ANTICIPATES ENDING THE BUDGET YOU'RE WITH A BUDGET SURPLUS. WE THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT- THIS YEAR'S. WELL IN TERMS OF OUR THOUGHTS ON THESE MATTERS- WE THINK LOOKING AT TASTING SPENDING PLAN- SIX SUGGESTS THAT THE PROPOSAL LEVEL OF FUNDING IS ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT HE SINGS BUDGET WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD EVEN TREAT THIS AUGMENTATION AS A MAXIMUM LEVEL SUPPORT AND HOW SOME OPTIONS TO ADJUST ACCORDINGLY WHERE- THE KNEE REVISION TO COME AND- WITH THE- WORST BUDGET CONDITION AND WE HAVE CURRENTLY I'M FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE COULD CONTEMPLATE SUPPORTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EMPLOYEE SALARIES COULD ALSO CONCENTRATE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF BUDGET SURPLUS FOR THE SCHOOL. AGAIN THESE ARE ALL THINGS LEGISLATURE COULD WEIGH ONCE IT HAS MORE INFORMATION THAN THEY- ARE MADE ANALYSIS ARE ARE ARE ANALYSIS- THAT WE SUBMITTED- PUBLICLY A FEW DAYS AGO- HAD A FEW OTHER SECTIONS IN IT WE HAD A SECTION TALKING ABOUT- STUDENT TUITION LEVELS ARE GETTING SOME TRADE OFFS TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TUITION INCREASES AT THESE THINGS WE ALSO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO ACQUIRE HASTINGS TO REPORT ON HIS EXPERIENCE ON USING ONLINE EDUCATION DURING THE PANDEMIC. BOB FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALL LEAVE- FURTHER ELABORATION ABOUT. SECURITY IS NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF I WOULD JUST STATE DID. NORMALLY I MIGHT HAVE A QUESTION OR TWO TO DRAW THIS OUT WE HAVE. THIRTEEN ISSUES AND I KNOW SENATOR MAN HAS A QUESTION SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE PRESENTATION SAID THE AGENDA. CLEARLY ELUCIDATED THIS AND WE'LL SEE WHERE WE ARE AT THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISE AND VISITORS TO CENTER GOVERNMENT. YEAH I JUST HAD A I GUESS I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IT IT SEEMS TO ME IF I'M STATING THIS CORRECTLY. AND THAT WE ARE BACK FILLING THE 10% CUT FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THEN PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCREASE THIS YEAR. I IN RETURN UC HASTINGS WILL HOLD ITS TUITION FLAT THIS YEAR. AND I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU SEE ACING SCHOOL LIVE FRIENDS THERE- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- WHY IS UC HASTINGS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER LAW SCHOOLS IN THE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS OTHER. DEPARTMENTS AND UNIVERSITIES. ARE THERE PLANS TO TRY TO. BACK FILL ANY OF THE OTHER UC'S OR THE UC HASTINGS GOING TO BE A ONE OFF AND THIS QUESTION WILL BE DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN RELIGIOUS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THE QUESTION SENATOR I WOULD KNOW THAT HASTINGS THE PROPOSAL IS FOR A SPECIFIC TUITION INCREASE THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROPOSED IN THE FALL. AND IT'S A TWO POINT ONE NET REVENUE GAIN THAT THAT TUITION INCREASE WOULD HAVE EARNED IN RESOURCES FOR HASTINGS CHART PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE THE TWO POINT ONE SPECIFICALLY TO BALANCE OUT THAT TUITION AND TO FUNCTION AS A TUITION BY OUR- IN TERMS OF- TREATING. DIFFERENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T THAT'S NOT THE APPROACH. AS WE VIEW IT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE BUDGET IT IN A IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY WHERE IT'S SO MUCH LARGER AND FUNCTIONS AND IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION WHICH IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF STATE FUNDING- YEAH. BUT IT JUST THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN FOR HASTINGS ON WHAT THE UC WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THEN LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT. WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SURVEY AND I UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY HASTINGS'S IS A SPECIAL CASE BUT- WHEN YOU TALK TO ANYBODY IN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM I THINK THERE IS A CONCERN THERE THAT THEY ARE. BEING ASKED TO DO A LOT RIGHT NOW ALSO BEING ASKED TO HOLD TUITIONS FLAT. AND SO- IS THIS THAT STRIKE ME AS A SAID IN ICE ICE AND FULLY SUPPORT THE THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FOR HASTINGS I GUESS I. WHAT I'M WONDERING IS WHY THE REST THE UC'S HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT. WITH I THINK IT LEASES THE LAST HEARING WE HAD A THREE PERCENT. INCREASE WHICH COMES ON THE 10% CUT LAST YEAR SO- I GUESS I I'M HEARING FROM YOU THERE'S NO PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR PROVIDE ANYTHING LIKE THIS LEVEL OF- AUGMENTATION FOR THE UC SYSTEM. WELL I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE ARE PROPOSING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT LAST WEEK WE- ARE PROPOSAL NOW IS TO HAVE. ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE UC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. AND SO. WE CAN ELABORATE MORE- UPSET THE UC RANG- BUT I'LL JUST NOTE THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES BOTH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND LAST WEEK DO ACCOUNT FOR. THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF THE UC SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU- SENATOR MEN AND JUST TO NOTE THAT THE- OUR EIGHTH AND FINAL HEARING MONDAY MORNING WILL BE ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE WILL BE A CHANCE IF THERE IS A REASON TO VOTE TO RAISE THAT ISSUE THAT. LET ME THANK- OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HERE FOR THE FIRST PANEL WE APPRECIATE IT WHO ARE WE WILL PROBABLY SEE YOU AGAIN IN APRIL AND MAY AND WE WILL MOVE TO ITEMS TWO AND THREE THEY'RE BOTH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. THE ISSUE TO IS TO SIT BOX AND LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY ISSUE THREE IS THE EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS. AND WHILE THE EIGHT CORE TWO SEPARATE ITEMS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT WE HAD THE SAME THREE PANELISTS FOR BOTH TWO ITEMS WILL HAVE THEM PERCENT THOSE ITEMS TOGETHER AND THEN TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND THE PANEL WILL BE JENNIFER LOUIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A GREG LUCAS TO STATE LIBRARIAN AND AGAIN JASON CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE KOLEOS OFFICE WILL BEGIN WITH JENNIFER WILL BE WELCOME TO THE- TO THE COMMITTEE. I THINK YOU'RE MUTED SOMETIMES. HELLO YES WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS JENNIFER LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE STATE LIBRARY AUGMENTATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUR CONTINUATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMPHASIS ON EQUITY ACCESS AND BUDGET RESILIENCY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWO POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING JOURNAL FINE AND EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR TOTAL AUGMENTATION FOR THE STATE LIBRARY AT TEN POINT THREE MILLION. STATE LIBRARY ONGOING INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE CONTINUATION OF THE ONLINE SERVICE SYSTEMS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE ZIP BOOK PROGRAM AND LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY THE BUS IT BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE TIME SUPPORT FOR LOCAL LIBRARY COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND BOOK MOBILES AND EARLY LEARNING AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WITH THE ACTUAL CONCLUDE MY WITH MY PRESENTATION I'D BE HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL AS REQUESTED AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN WILL WELCOME THE STATE LIBRARIAN GREG LUCAS WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. FORENING THANK YOU- I DON'T I DON'T DON'T INTEREST THE COMMITTEES TIME I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH TO ADD SO WHAT JENNIFER SAID. THERE IS. I MEAN IT'S TERRIFIC THAT LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS NOW AN ON GOING COME. APPROPRIATION WHICH HELPS HELPS IN PLANNING WHICH HELPS POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE PROGRAM AND DO A LOT OF GOOD THINGS- BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM WORD STEEDS KIDS IN. SUMMER TIME- THE IF THE MONEY CAN SHOW UP AT THE LIBRARY SOMETIME THIS SPRING RATHER THAN JULY ONE WHEN THE BUDGET TAKES EFFECT. THEN IT CAN BE PUT TO GOOD USE AND FEEDING HUNGRY FOR KIDS THIS SUMMER. AND SO THE DEPARTMENT I KNOW IS HAS SAID TO US THAT THEY- IT IS YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A VEHICLE TO MAKE. THE DELIVERY OF THOSE FUNDS HAPPEN AND THEY'VE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS FROM THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND B. ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR EVERYONE'S WILLINGNESS TO TRY AND SEE IF WE CAN- COME IN UP FRONT. TO MAKE MAKE THAT WORK. AND A AGAIN LIKE ALL ARE EITHER ARE. YOU KNOW THE STAFF RECOMMENDS HOLDING THEM OPEN SO IF THERE'S QUESTIONS GREAT BUT OTHERWISE WE CAN JUST ALL THE ITEMS OPEN. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE L. A. ALL RIGHT SO- AS THIS IS A COMBINED ISSUE TO ISSUE THREE I'LL TALK ABOUT BOTH ISSUES IN MY TESTIMONY- FOR ISSUE TO- WHICH WOULD BE- THE ONGOING PROPOSALS. ON WE HAVE A COUPLE OF- CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS JUST AROUND THE STATE'S- BUDGET CONDITION- AND PRECARIOUS BUDGET CONDITION AND PROJECTED OUT YOUR DATA SETS. THIS ISN'T UP THE MOST OPPORTUNE TIME TO BE- OUR FUNDING WHAT WHAT ARE EFFECTIVE WHAT EFFECTIVELY BEEN PILOTS ON ON GOING BASIS. IN ADDITION TO THAT- WE RAISE SOME CONCERNS IN THE PAST WITH SOME OF THESE INITIATIVES- THAT WE THAT WE THINK MERIT- EITHER REJECTING THE PROPOSAL OR POTENTIALLY MODIFYING- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS. AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'D BE HAPPY TO OPERATE MORE ON JUNE EIGHTH THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE- BUT GIVEN THESE FACTORS ARE ON ISSUE TOO ANYWAY WE RECOMMENDED THAT. YOU HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN YOU GET MORE INFORMATION IT NAY REDUCTION- ASSESS THE STATE'S BUDGET SITUATION. THE BUDGET SITUATION WERE TO WORSEN AND YOU ARE FACING- MANY OTHER ONGOING PARTY START THE BUDGET. THESE COULD BE THE KINDS OF PROPOSALS THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER TOWARDS OUR REDIRECTION FOR THOSE HIGHER PRIORITIES. NO ONE ISSUE. THREE WHICH ARE ONE TIME PROPOSALS. WE HAD A DIFFERENT. FOR THAT PROPOSED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FIVE MILLION OF THAT IS FOR- AFTER SCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS AT LIBRARIES. AND THE THREE MILLION IS FOR- WHAT WE CALL BOOK MOBILE PROGRAM SAID THINGS. LIKE OUR PURCHASING VEHICLE THAT CAN YOU TO THE RE TO BE TRENDS ALWAYS THE LIKE FOR AND OTHER REALLY ACT THAT X. SERVICE TO LIVE- INTO THE COMMUNITY. ARE SYSTEM FIVE NO IS- OTHER ALREADY PROVIDES THE AND TO LOCAL I. T. AGENCIES. ON TO PROVIDE FREE AND CATER TO AND SO THE REAL FROM US SET OF FOR Y. TO THE START HE STARTS BACK. I DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE A CLEAR RASH TO A WE RECOMMEND THE FROM OF THE- WHICH- BUT ON THE PROPOSED THREE DOLLARS WE THINK THAT COULD MERIT MORE CONSIDERATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE- IT DOES SEEM MORE NARROWLY TAILORED TOWARDS- VERY SPECIFIC LIBRARY SERVICES AND ALSO IT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO THE PANDEMIC OR OR COULD TO THE EXTENT THAT IT. HELPS GET A MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ACCESS ALL LIBRARIES AND THEN IT RESOURCES IN THE MIDST THE PANDEMIC SHOULD NOT PARTICULARLY FOR THE THREE MILLION WE THINK IT DOES MERIT SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION- AND YOU COULD WEIGH THAT AGAINST MANY OF THE OTHER ONE TIME PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TIME TO MAKING FINAL. BUDGET SECONDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT TWO EACH OF THE PANELISTS AND LET ME JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT. WHICH IS OF. IT YOU KNOW IF WE WEREN'T PRESSED FOR TIME I MIGHT ACTUALLY ASKED THE STATE LIBRARIAN TO EXPAND A LITTLE ON THE STATE OF THE LIBRARY AND- AND LONG TERM NEEDS AND LONG TERM GOVERNMENTS AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. I'M CONFIDENT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH HIM ON. AND ADDITIONALLY. I PERSONALLY AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE NOTION IF WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THE LAUNCHES OF THE LIBRARY TO TRIED TO DO IT IN TIME FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT AND I HOPE THAT. THAT THERE IS. THOUGH THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT. IN A TIMELY FASHION. AND I AM SURE. AS THE L. A. O. SAID. THE TRACTORS THAT CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE MAY REVISE FORMERLY COVERED SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT THE EARLY INDICATIONS OURS. IS ARE WE WILL BE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEREFORE THESE THINGS WILL. BE STRONGLY CONSIDERED. THE SO WITH THAT I JUST THANK ALL THE PANELISTS REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU BEING HERE TODAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO FISH YOU NUMBER FOUR. WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE OF THE STATE LIBRARY IT'S THE CORPORATION FOR EDUCATION NETWORK INITIATIVES OR SCENIC. AND THE PANELISTS WILL BE THREE OF THE- ARE. THE THREE PREVIOUS PENELAS WAS TO MORE FROM. SCENIC AND- I DON'T KNOW IF BOTH ARE SPEAKING FROM SCENIC BUT OF THE PANELISTS ARE JENNIFER. LOUIS GREG LUCAS GROWL READING CROWN. TONY MILLION AND JASON CONSTANT. WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WILL BEGIN ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WITH JENNIFER. LOUIS HELLO AGAIN AS JENNIFER WE WOULD DEPART OF FINE. THE GOVERNOR'S BY AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FINE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON A FINE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ON A PLANE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE AND ONGOING FOR THE CORPORATION FOR SCENIC NETWORK INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS SCENIC. THESE FUNDS WILL PAY FOR INCREASED CYBERSECURITY AND OPERATIONAL COSTS RELATING TO CONTINUE PUBLIC LIBRARY PARTICIPATION AND SCENIC. THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT REAL TIME ONGOING MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF ALL LIBRARY CONNECTIONS ON THE NETWORK SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITY INFORMATION AND EVENT MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND ENHANCED NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND COVER ANNUAL INCREASE IN THE COST OF RUNNING THE NETWORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION I AM HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MOVED TO THE MISTER LUCAS THE STATE LIBRARY. NO I CAN'T IMPROVE ON JENNIFER'S RIVETING PRESENTATION. BUT I'M HAPPY TO ASK ANSWER QUESTIONS I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT I MEAN. SOME QUICK FEES COST INCREASES THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SCENIC HAS YOU KNOW HAD ANY INCREASE FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP WHICH INCLUDES YOU SEE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. K. THROUGH TWELVE- I THINK I SAID CSU BUT I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR FIFTEEN YEARS TO BE SERVED THEIR FIRST INCREASES IN THE STATE LIBRARY. ON BEHALF OF LIBRARIES AROUND CALIFORNIA HAS MEMBERSHIP ON THE BOARD THE GOVERNOR THAT HELPS GOVERN SCENIC. AND SO THESE INCREASES ARE NECESSARY OR SCENIC SUSTAINABILITY. AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE STATE TO COVER A PORTION OF THOSE ADDED COSTS. HELP REDUCE BARRIERS FOR IN A LESSER RESOURCE LIBRARIES AROUND THE STATE WHO ARE PROBABLY THE ONES THAT COULD USE YOU KNOW IMPROVED HIGH SPEED CONNECTIVITY MORE THAN SOME OTHER PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. ELECTED COULD NOT STAND THOSE BARRIERS AND ALLOWS THEM TO PARTICIPATE SO THANK. YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AND I WON'T. REMAR YOU TO FUTURE TIME YOU REFER TO THE FINE PRESS AS RIVETING. THEN WHEN TO ROME RINKER FROM A SCENIC. GOOD MORNING SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ROLE RINCON VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS AT SCENIC SCENIC OPERATES EACH CALIFORNIA RESEARCH AND EDUCATION NETWORK DELIVERING BROADBAND SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN BROADBAND THIS IS BECOMING ESSENTIAL SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIANS SEEKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH SUBSTANTIAL REPRESENTATION BY FIVE PUBLIC SEGMENTS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY HAS DEVELOPED A FINANCIAL MODEL SUPPORT SCENIC BACK BAY FIND FAIR AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL MEMBERS. AS MISTER LUCAS WAS KIND ENOUGH TO POINT OUT OUR FEES HAVE NOT BEEN RAISED IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS INCREASES HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS TO SUSTAIN A HIGH QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT DISTINGUISHES SCENIC. GIVEN THE PRESUMPTION OF RISING COSTS AS WELL AS TO EXPAND AND SUPPORT NEW SERVICES IN AREAS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR MEMBERS SUCH AS CYBERSECURITY AND EVER EXPANDING BANDWIDTH NEEDS. THE SCENIC OF DIRECTORS NOT THESE FEES AS THE BACK NAKED FOR DISTRIBUTING. FAIRLY AMONG MEMBERS. THEY WERE CRITICALLY% AWARE. OF THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS NEED TO REQUEST FUNDS TO STATE BUDGET PROCESS SO THE BOARD INCORPORATED A PHASED APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. IN KEEPING WITH THE CHAIRS REQUEST FOR BREVITY WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE STAFF REGARDING THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BEING IN THE AGENDA. I WILL DO MY BEST TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE TODAY REGARDING THE NEW FEES OR THE NETWORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- IT DOES TONY MILLION WHICH TO SPEAK OR IS HE JUST HERE FOR QUESTIONS. EASIER FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU RIGHT THEN WILL MOVE TO THE AUDIO. WE HAVE TWO MESSAGES ONE ON THE SCENIC FEE INCREASES WHICH AS WAS NOTED BY PREVIOUS PANELISTS NOT ONLY IMPACTS STATE LIBRARY BUT ALL THE EDUCATION SEGMENTS. UNINSPECTED SEPARATELY WE HAVE A MESSAGES ON- THE BUDGET PROPOSALS PERTAINING TO THE STATE LIBRARY SPECIFICALLY SOMEONE AT. ADDRESS EACH ONE OF THOSE. SO WITH REGARD TO THAT SCENE ACTUALLY INCREASES. ARE SEEN IT DID MEET WITH OUR OFFICE. AND PROVIDED US ON SOME INFORMATION- FOR EXAMPLE THEY WALKED US THROUGH- WHAT THE FEE INCREASES WERE INTENDED TO COVER- THEY ALSO PROVIDED US A NARRATIVE SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES AND- EVEN COUNTERED IN RECENT YEARS. BUT SCENIC- READ BY DECLINED OUR REQUEST TO PROVIDE- BASIC BUDGET INFORMATION- UP ABOUT ITS ORGANIZATION- FOR EXAMPLE IT'S FUNDING LEVELS AND FUNDING BY SOURCE SPENDING LEVELS. THE SIZE OF ITS SURPLUSES OR DEFICITS AND THE SIZE OF ITS ARE RESERVED. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE AREN'T ABLE TO ASSESS. THE MERITS OF THE FEE INCREASES. NO I'M TO THE STATE LIBRARY- ABSENCES OF POLICY CHANGE THESE ARE COSTS AT THE STATE LIBRARY WHAT WILL FACE AND FUNDING THIS PROGRAM SO WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT THE STATE- CORPORATION THESE COST INCREASES INTO ITS BUDGET. DECISIONS FOR THE PROGRAM- WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE A FEW OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT- SOME OF THE PROPOSED INCREASES IN WHERE WE'RE STILL FOLLOWING UP WITH THEM SO WE PLAN TO. RETURN TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND RETURNS THE CAN BE STAFF AND PROVIDE THEM. A FULLER ASSESSMENT ONCE WE GET THOSE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RESOLVED BUT WE DO HAVE ON TWO ISSUES THAT WE'D LIKE TO RAISE FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS SOME UNSPENT FUNDING- IN THIS BROADBAND PROGRAM IT'S CONNECTED TO GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET THAT WERE INTENDED AS SUCH LIBRARIES AND- CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET AND UPGRADING THEIR INTERNET SPEEDS. AND WE THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THESE ARMS- FUNDS COULD BE USED TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND INITIAL YEARS. WE RECOMMEND YOU GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATE LIBRARY ON HOW THEY PLAN TO SPEND THE REMAINING UNSPENT FUNDS AND SEE IF THEY ARE POTENTIALLY. AVAILABLE TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS. THE OTHER ISSUE LIKE TO RAISE YOUR CONCERN. IS RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME OVER BUDGETING IN THE PROGRAM- THAT IS. THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN APPROPRIATING FUNDS AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER LEVELS AND- ACTUAL SPENDING ON THE PROGRAM SH. AND ACCORDING TO STATE LIBRARY OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO PROVIDE. THE STATE LIBRARY. A CUSHION IN CASE THERE IS A UNEXPECTED COST INCREASES AND NEW YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE AN EXCHANGE AND SURCHARGES THAT IT'S CHARGED BY THE BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WE OVERREACH IS ARMING THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO INTERNET ITSELF IT'S NOT IMPACTING THE STATE OUR GENERAL FUND A CONDITION. SIGNIFICANT RANGE WE THINK A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH WOULD BE TO- APPROPRIATE FINES BASED ON- PROJECT IT'S PROJECTED COSTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN I JUST- PROGRAMMATIC SPENDING AS TIME GOES ON ONCE MORE INFORMATION COMES AVAILABLE AND- I JUST STATE LIBRARIES BUDGET WHERE THEY'RE UNEXPECTED COST INCREASES. ON THE MERCHANT TALKING ABOUT IS AN APPROACH WE TAKE FROM A STATE PROGRAM SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE A REGIONAL APPROACH TAKE CARE TO. I HAVE A CHANCE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF TWO QUICK QUESTIONS ARE ONE IS FOR FINANCE- WHICH IS BASICALLY. WHAT YOU INTEND TO RECOMMEND WITH REGARDING TO THE- THE AMOUNT OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS. AT GENERALLY WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE ADMINISTRATION'S REAPPROPRIATION OF THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION IS CARRY OVER FOR THE REMAINING FIVE MILLION A ONE TIME FINDS I WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT FOR BROADBAND EQUIPMENT GRANTS WITH THE EXPAT EXPECTATIONS AT THAT TIME THAT TWO MILLION OF THAT FIVE MILLION WOULD SUPPORT CONNECTION UP FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES. WHO LACK ACCESS FOR BROADBAND NETWORKS AND THREE MILLION OF THOSE FUNDS WHAT EXPAND CAPACITY FOR LIBRARIES ALREADY CONNECTED AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXPECTATIONS OUTLINED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT REMAIN UNCHANGED FOR THE REMAINING FINDS. COULD YOU AT HOME I'M SORRY COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT THAT MEANS. DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU'RE TARGETING THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ORIGINAL PURPOSE JUST CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND TOWARD THAT ORIGINAL PURPOSES AT WHICH ATTRACT. LIBRARIES THANK YOU. AND THEN FOR SCENIC LET ME JUST ASK WITH THEIR PROBLEM AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE L. A. L. NO WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND TRY THEM FOR THEIR INFORMATION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN LET ME THANK THAT THE PANEL WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE SORRY FOR THE QUICKNESS OF THE HEARING. AND- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM. THE PANEL IS CHEN KACU FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIE GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAROLINE'S ACREE. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THERE WE THINK THERE'S A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WHICH APPARENTLY IS A DRAFT CHOICE TO BE NAMED SO I WILL FIGURE OUT WHO THAT IS WHEN. POLICY WAS SET THERE SO I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHO IT IS OKAY- THEN WE WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

OVER THE LAST ELEVEN MONTHS AS WAS SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. PROGRAMS AND BOTH THE K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED. BUT THROUGH THIS COMPLEX PERIOD WE'VE LEARNED THAT CALIFORNIANS NEED US MORE THAN EVER. WELL A COMPLETE ANALYSIS IS STILL MONTHS AWAY. SOME INITIAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IN PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN HAVE TURNED TO OUR PROGRAMS FOR DIGITAL LITERACY OR TO GAIN ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO SEEING INTERESTS AND SHORT TERM CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATIONS GROW. OUR PROGRAMS ARE AN IMPORTANT SAFETY NET WHICH CAN PROPEL ADULTS TO GREATER OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS REASON WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PROVIDING A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA THE BILL EDUCATION PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY GIVEN THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO TEACHING AND LEARNING MODALITIES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ONE MILLION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COULD NOT BE MORE TIMELY. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRAM APPORTIONMENT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED WITH GUIDANCE TO DEVELOP SPENDING OVER THIRTY MONTHS. AND BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT FISCAL ANALYSIS OVERALL CARRYOVER IS ONLY AT 10% AND EXPECTED TO DECLINE TO AROUND FINALLY THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MADE OTHER PROGRESS TO ENSURING TIMELY ALLOCATION OF ANNUAL RESOURCES. TO AS WE PLAN FOR THE STATE'S RECOVERY AND RESILIENCY WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE PIVOTAL. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND I WAS REMISS IN NOT MENTIONING WHEN I LISTED TE PANELS. AT THE OUTSET OF POSTING HOUSING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND ALL RECOGNIZE HIM NOW THANK YOU. THANK NUMBERS PASTA HOUSING WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE WITH REGARD TO THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS YEAH AUGMENTATION COULD HELP ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS IN OPERATING THE PROGRAMS. WE JUST KNOW THAT THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATE THE COLOR RATE WHICH IS BASED ON A PRICE INDEX FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE UPDATED IN APRIL WHEN THE STATE RECEIVES ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC DATA. AND WILL LIKELY SEE REVISED RATE AT REVISED SO LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE CALL AT THAT TIME. WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSED ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STATEWIDE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE WILL JUST WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION ON WHETHER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND CD. INTEND TO PUT OUT A REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS AND OUR OUR ESSAY SO THAT YOU MANY COLLEGES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES. OF EDUCATION CAN OPENLY BID ON THIS CONTRACT THAT'S HOW ZAC COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WAS SELECTED TO DO THE WORK BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHESTER'S OFFICE WAS PLANNING TO AUTOMATICALLY WE AWARD THE CONTRACT TO THE SAC COUNTY OFFICE OF BAD THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO USE THE RFA PROCESS. DOING SO COULD HELP IDENTIFY OR CONFIRM THE BEST CONTRACTOR SUITABLE FOR THIS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANELISTS I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE LET ME JUST FOLLOW UP ON WHAT THE L. A. O. JUST SAID WITH THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DO YOU HAVE A CLEAR INTENT WITH REGARD TO GOING OUT FOR THAT CONTRACT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION NO FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CONSULT WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- WHEN AND IF THESE RESOURCES. DO MAKE IT INTO THE BUDGET ACT. OKAY I JUST THINK THERE'S INTEREST IN WHATEVER THE DECISION IS AND THEN SECONDLY FROM. I THINK IT WAS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT MENTIONED- THAT DATA ISN'T TOTALLY AND YET TO ACCEPT FOR. OF THAT FOR HER CLASSES WERE UP IN CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND- ONE OTHER THING AND SO MY QUESTION IS THERE ANY WAY AT THIS POINT TWO WITH DATA TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON ADULT EDUCATION. BERMAN ROMAN DATA I MEAN OVERALL WE'VE SEEN ENROLLMENTS- IT KIND OF DECLINE STATEWIDE AND SO WE SEE A DECLINE AROUND THE SAME RATE THAT- IT'S DECLINED FOR. COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PRESUMABLY FOR- FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS OUR FINAL ANALYSIS TYPICALLY COMES IN FROM OUR COLLEGES AROUND- MARCH APRIL AND SPRING WE ALSO GET MORE DETAILS AROUND THE TYPES OF ENROLLMENT. AS A REFERENCE ONE AREA THAT WE HAVE SEEN INTEREST- IS AROUND DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAM SO WILL WANT TO DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THAT AND SEE. WHY THAT IS OF INTEREST ONE PRESUMPTION IS THAT AS MORE PARENTS ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THEIR STUDENTS AT HOME- THEY ALSO HAVE INTEREST IN GAINING SKILLS IN THIS AREA. AND WE'RE SEEINGMORE QUESTIONS EMERGE AROUND SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE AN AREA WHERE COLLEGES ANARCHY TOLD PROGRAMS CAN ADAPT THAT WE MEET OUR DEMAND OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THEN LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION- BECAUSE I'M REALLY FAMILIAR WITH ENROLLMENT ISSUES AT THE THREE HIGHER EDUCATION BRANCHES IN K. TO TWELVE. BUT I'M NOT SURE I THINK YOU JUST SAID ENROLLMENT WAS OFF AND SO OFTEN ROMANS OFF HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE FISCAL SITUATION DO THEY HAVE FUNDS LEFT. THAT THEN WOULD ADDRESS THESE OTHER NEEDS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- WHAT'S THE FISCAL SITUATION THAT RESULTS. FROM A DROP OFF IN ENROLLMENT. YES THANK YOU GREAT. OF LINE A GAY TWELVE. HOUR CALLER- WE'VE INTO- TITLE FIVE EMERGENCY ALLOWANCES WHICH PROTECT OF COLLEGES FROM ENROLLMENT DECLINES IN ANY SUBSEQUENT OFFICE SCHOOL RESOURCE DECLINE SO THAT IS PROVIDING A LEVEL OF FISCAL STABILITY THAT IS HELPING OUR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS- AND I CAN- I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUE. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO HIGHLIGHT HOW THEY'VE HANDLED ANY. FISCAL DECLINE ON THE K. TWELVE LEVEL. AT SIX SIX CHAIRMAN- A COUPLE NOTES BEFORE I HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CAROLINE ZACHARY WHO IS THE EXPERT IN THIS AREA THE FIRST NEW IS THAT- WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND HIGH SCHOOL EQUIPMENTS EQUIVALENCY BUT A DECLINE IN LOW LEVEL LITERACY STUDENTS AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS HANDED OVER TO CAROLINE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW OF THAT DATA THAT WE DO HAVE THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN. DR CAROLINE ZACHRY ADULT EDUCATION ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE HAVE SEEN WHEN WE COMPARE OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY DATA IN THE VERY FIRST QUARTER TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAH WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN. ROUGHLY. 675-200-1000 STUDENTS ENROLLMENT AND THIS STATE IS COMING OUT OF- ALL OF THE K. TWELVE ADULTS SCHOOLS IN ANY OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE NONCREDIT PROGRAMS THAT ARE WE LA AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTING INTO. OUR DATA SYSTEM CALLED COST SAYS WHICH IS- WHICH GIVES IS LIVE. ANSWERABLE TO SEE THAT DECLINE. OKAY WELL I THANK YOU WILL BE INTERESTED IN THAT ISSUE HEADING TOWARD THE MAY REVISED JUST TO SEE. WHAT THE ACTUAL SITUATION IS WHETHER IT NEEDS TO BE REGARDED TO THESE EMERGING AIDS OR HOW IT'S GOING TO BE HANDLED SO I THINK THAT'LL BE ONE THING WORK INTEREST SENATOR MEANT YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. GREAT THE MEN ARE LET ME THANK THE PANELISTS WE APPRECIATE- YOU BEING HERE AND WE ARE GOING TO- MOVE.

THEN I'M GONNA MOVE ON ITEM SEVEN WHICH WE HAVE THE COGNATE- THE CALDERON PROGRAM AT THE STATE'S LARGEST IN FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. IS SUSPECTED TO SERVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND STUDENTS AND PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION EIGHT EIGHT. THIS TOTALS INCLUDE REVISED COCHRAN ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF NEW AND RENEWAL COCHRAN AWARDEES IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE GOVERNOR'S DIDN'T FIFTY EIGHT POINT TWO. MILLION ONGOING FUND TO RESTORE CALM ELIGIBLE. FOR STUDENTS IMPACT BY CHANGE IN LIVES INSTEAD DE TO THE CALL NINETEEN.

TO OFFER ADMISSION TO AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE MAXIMAL CAGR IN TUITION AWARD. FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. I NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS. THE GRAND AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO AMEND THE STATUTE TO THE LATE THIS REQUIREMENT FROM APPLY NEED TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO APPLY IN IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE STABILITY TO STUDENTS WHO ARE CONTEMPLATING ATTENDING A PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION AND DOES CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- JAKE BRUNNER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION WE AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WELCOME AND SUPPORT EACH OF THESE THREE PROPOSALS ALL BRIEFLY SPEAK TO EACH OF THEM. ON THE FINANCIAL AID COMPLETION REQUIREMENT WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION UNDERSTAND WELL THE SIGNIFICANT BARRIER THAT THESE APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES CAN POSE TO STUDENTS AS THEY SEEK FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PURSUE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION THE CURRENT FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS FEATURE OVER ONE HUNDRED QUESTIONS MANY OF WHICH USE VERY TECHNICAL LANGUAGE I'M AROUND TAXES ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. THEY CAN BE VERY UNFAMILIAR TO STUDENTS PARTICULARLY FROM FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOING FAMILIES. AND WE ALSO KNOW FROM OUR OWN DATA THAT THERE'S A TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS EACH YEAR WHO ARE NOT APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE THIS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THEM TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS. PROVIDED THROUGH THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM. WE'RE AT THE EXISTING COMMISSION WE'RE VERY PROUD ADMINISTER SEVERAL OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT SEEK TO HELP STUDENTS AND FAMILIES COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL AID. I BELIEVE THAT THESE CAN BE IMPORTANT RESOURCES TO OUR PARTNERS IN K. TWELVE AS THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THIS REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN THE BUDGET ACT. ON THE CAL GRANT A- ELIGIBILITY RESTORATION AGAIN WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR SEGMENT PARTNERS REGARDING THIS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO PROVIDE THIS RELIEF TO STUDENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S BEEN SOME CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE OUR CAMPUS PARTNERS IN SEGMENT REPRESENTATIVES WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION. TO SPEAK TO THAT- THE CURRENT STATUS IN THE CURRENT NUMBER OF STUDENTS IMPACTED. AS THE PROCESS FURNISHING INITIATING THIS CHANGE AND LIVING STATUS ACTUALLY BEGINS. AT THE CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID OFFICE LEVEL AND WE'VE BEEN RECEIVED THAT DATA THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A CRACK RECORD CHANGE FORM AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND I COULD SHARE MORE IN TERMS OF THE DATA WE'VE RECEIVED THUS FAR THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND FINALLY ON THE FINAL THE THIRD PROPOSAL WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE THE COMMISSIONWOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS YOU FOR FROM REPRESENTATIVES FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL TO OUR STUDENTS TO SEE. ANY DISRUPTION TO THEIR ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS PERIOD OF SUCH UNCERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND- A YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE TO OUR GRAVES FROM ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES WORK ON IMPROVING TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS. I AM JUST SPEAKING- TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT ON THE AGENDA. WE ACC YOU SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO PUSH OUT THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS YEAR GIVEN THE HISTORIC DESTRUCTION WE HAVE SEEN FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FOR INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THE STATE. THESTATUTORY CONSTRUCT IS BORN OUT A DESIRE. ADMINISTRATION CDT PATHWAYS EXPANDED INTO OUR SECTOR AND OUR INSTITUTIONS EMBRACE THAT OPPORTUNITY SINCE THE AGREEMENT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET THIRTY NINE AT PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS HAVE ARTICULATED UNTIL HE'S TWENTY T. PATHWAY MEANING THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE THAT EXCEPT THE AT T. ARE PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES. HAS YOUR GENDER NOTES LAST YEAR WE HAD OVER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY T. STUDENTS ADMITTED TO OUR PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS EXCEEDING OUR STATUTORY TARGET. AND AS OF THE LAST ACADEMIC YEAR WE NOW HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN ARTICULATED AT T. PATHWAYS TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN NOVEMBER WE SURVEYED OUR ADMISSIONS OFFICES WITH FIFTY SIX INSTITUTIONS RESPONDING WHO COLLECTIVELY AND ROLL ABOUT 91% OF OUR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. A SURVEY FINDINGS REVEALED A 7% DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT OVERALL AND A 6% DECLINE AMONG TRANSFER STUDENT ROMAN. WE ALSO LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE RESPONSES OF R. EIGHTY T. PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS AND FOUND THAT THE DECLINE FOR THEIR TRANSFER STUDENT ROLE THAT WAS AROUND SIX AND A HALF PERCENT. SO WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS FOR THIS ACADEMIC YEAR'S AT T. ADMITS THOSE SURVEY FINDINGS CERTAINLY LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT THE PANDEMIC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR AT T. NUMBERS THIS YEAR. AND POTENTIALLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE SECTOR'S COMMITMENT AT T. AND TO THE STUDENTS WHO USE THAT PATHWAY. AND SO WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE DOCUMENT AND REMAINS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING EARLY ASSURANCES TO STUDENTS. AS WAS MENTIONED I BELIEVE BY. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WILL HAVE THE L. A. O. MORNING CHEN SENATOR IS LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OCTOBER THE FIFTH PUZZLES IN THAT ORDER THEY PAYING YOUR GENDER BEGINNING DAD THE PROPOSAL'S PAID FOR GAUGE AND. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S REQUIRING TO CONFIRM THE ALL STATE SENATE FINANCIALLY APPLIQUE AS A PROBLEM APPROACH TO INCREASE FINANCIAL TO OBTAIN. INCLUDING THE FACT PROGRAM PROGRAM ASSISTANT AID COMMISSION NOTED. COM SUCH A PACKAGE IF YOU'RE KINDA. ALSO HIGHLIGHTED FISCAL. ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. ONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TRY ATTENTION TO IS AN ACCOUNT AND ENTITLE PROGRAM. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS HAS ITS INTENDED EFFECT OF INCREASING FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION RATES MORE STUDENTS WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR ENTITLEMENT AWARDS AND WE EXPECT THIS TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN ENTITLEMENT SPENDING BEGINNING AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PLAN FOR WORK AT ALL DISPOSAL. ATTENTION FISCAL IMPASSE ON THAT PAUL SIDE OF THE BY. AS YOU MAY KNOW WELL IS THE SUPPOSED AWAY NOT IN THE- TECH. MANDATE THE STATE WOULD NEED TO COVER THE ASSOCIATED COSTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE WAY THE CURRENT. LANGUAGES WRITTEN DISTRICTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION OVER HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE RULES SO. THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE WHAT THE COST MIGHT BE. RECOMMENDED OPTING FALLS ON HOW. AS IT IS A PROM WAITING. FINANCIAL AID UP. BUT WE ALSO RECOMMEND WITH THE- ON THE SPECIFIC TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T IMPOSE ANY UNNECESSARY COSTS DISTRICTS AND- THAT IT ADDRESSES ANY OTHER IMPLEMENTATION CONSENSUS JUST LIKE JIMMY. THANKS TO THE COMPANY ELIGIBILITY RESTORATION PROPOSAL WHICH APPEARS ON PGE TWENTY VERY DONDE. I DO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT IS A NEW ISSUE EMERGING THIS YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT STUDENTS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FINANCIAL NEED. BASED ON HOW CAMPUS IS CALCULATED STUDENTS FINANCIAL NEED. INTENSELY HIGHER FOR THOSE STUDENTS WERE LIVING ON CAMPUS AND STUDENTS WERE LIVING AT HOME WITH FAMILY. BECAUSE CAMPUSES THIS YEAR LARGELY OPERATING REMOTELY WERE SEEN MANY STUDENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE LIVED IN THE DORMS ARE INSTEAD LIVING AT HOME WITH FAMILY. AND A NUMBER OF THOSE STUDENTS HAVE LOST THEIR **** AN ELIGIBILITY AS INSULTS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY DRESSES AS UNINTENDED EFFECT. AND WHAT CAMPUS IS OPERATING REMOTELY WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE MOVED HOME TO THE PANDEMIC TO RECEIVE THE TUITION COVERAGE THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HAD THEY LIVED ON CAMPUS. BUT MORE GIVEN THE STUDENTS HAVE HAD THEIR WORDS ARE DRAWN IN THE CURRENT YEAR- TAKING EARLY ACTION THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF RESTORING THAT EXPENSIVE- YOU NEED COMMISSION HAS NOTED THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF IMPACTED STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING LEVELS FIFTY EIGHT MILLION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE SECONDS THE FALL. WE EXPECT THAT MORE RECENT DATA ON THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO A LOWER COST ESTIMATE. AND SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE ALSO RECOMMEND REVISITING THE FUNDING LEVEL SENSITIVE THIS PROPOSAL THE MAYOR VISION. ONE UPDATED DATA MAY BE AVAILABLE ON THE NUMBER OF IMPACTED STUDENTS. BUT A LITTLE. WE ON THE PROPOSAL REGARDING THE TRANSFER TARGET FOR THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT SECTOR. ICAC SEARS NOTED THE SECTOR HAS EXPERIENCED A MOMENT DECLINES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AS A RESULT THERE'S A RISK THEY MIGHT MISS THEIR TRANSFORMATIONS TARGET FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN AWARD AMOUNTS FOR STUDENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PREVENT THIS CONTRADICTION WHAT AMOUNTS FOR THESE INCOMING STUDENTS. PROMOTING EARLY ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF FIGHTING THE STUDENTS MORE PREDICTABILITY REGARDING A FINANCIALLY COVERAGE AS THE MAKING ALL THE DECISIONS THIS SPRING. AND SO WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL. THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO ALL OF YOU AND FOR DRESSING ALL THREE ITEMS- I THINK W MIGHT. HAVE DRAWN SOME WARM. THINGS OUT IF WE HAD MORE TIME BUT I AM GOING TO ASK ONE QUESTION- OF- JAKE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THAT'S THAT IN YOUR- TESTIMONY. THAT MENTIONED. HOW SHE SAT QUARTER NIGHTS WITH THE LOCAL AGENT. EDUCATION AGENCIES IN ASSISTING THE STUDENTS WITH FILLING OUT FINANCIAL AID FORMS AND- HOW SOMETIMES THAT. WHICH IS THAT NOT WORKING LEADS TO A LOSS. I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S- A CHANGE IN COORDINATION ANTICIPATED TO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL OR WHETHER YOU'RE JUST REALLY. IDENTIFYING A LONG STANDING PROBLEM AND JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS IT IN A MORE STRONGER CONCERTED WHY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A GREAT QUESTION AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY SPOKE PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A MORE SYSTEMIC APPROACH FOR OUR STATE AND HELPING STUDENTS APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THOSE APPLICATIONS. AND GRADUATE WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE THAT TO THEM SHOULD THEY WISH TO PURSUE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. AS PART OF THAT MORE SYSTEMIC APPROACH WE'RE ASSESSING AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HOW WE CAN ORIENT OUR OUTREACH PROGRAMS TO BEST SUPPORT OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROVISION SHOULD BE ADOPTED- WE WERE IN FACT- CAN. ONE THREE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR TO UPDATE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR OUR KELSO PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS PROGRAM. IN WHICH SIXTEEN REGIONALLY BASED CONSORTIA PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID OUTREACH AND TUTORING SERVICES TO DISADVANTAGED K. TWELVE STUDENTS- TO INCREASE THEIR ACCESS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. AND INFORM STUDENTS ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES- FOR CAREER EDUCATION AS WELL AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE PROJECTS AS WELL AS OUR CASH FOR COLLEGE WORKSHOPS. AND AGREES TO SUBMIT CAMPAIGN THAT WE LAUNCHED IN RECENT YEARS CAN ALL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN SUPPORTING OUR K. TWELVE PARTNERS IN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING THIS REQUIREMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL- CONTINUE TO BE INTERESTED IN THAT AS WE ARE GONE WRONG CENTER MEANT YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON SUN GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANKS TO THE PANELISTS ALTHOUGH ONLY ALEX GRAVES IS GOING AWAY. WE'RE COMING BACK TO ISSUES NINE AND TEN WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HEAR PRESENTATIONS TOGETHER ON IT'S TO COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AND FOSTER YOUTH CAL GRANT. AND WE'LL BE HEARING FROM GABRIELA CHAVEZ TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JAKE BERMAN- AGAIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO HELLO WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THOSE TWO TOGETHER WILL BEGIN WITH GABRIELA SANCIOUS. HEY EVERYONE CHáVEZ BUT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOW THE COUPLE. CALL GRANT PROGRAM SUPPORTS FINANCIAL AID AWARDS FOR STUDENTS WHO DEMONSTRATE FINANCIAL NEED BUT DID NOT MEET ALL THE CRITERIA TO RECEIVE AN ENTITLEMENT OF WATER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE MILLION I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO FIND NINE THOUSAND CALL GRAND COMPETITIVE AWARDS. THIS WILL INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS. TO FIFTY THOUSAND. ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S BY GETTING A TWENTY MILLION AND GOING GENERAL FINE DOING CRAZY ACCESSIBLE FOR FORMER OR CURRENT FOSTER YOU. ELIGIBLE AT NEW ALREADY ALL CONQUERING THE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE AN AXIS AWARD. SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS NEW ALREADY WILL CALL GRAHAM B. STUDENTS WILL SEE THEIR ACCESO WERE INCREASED FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT. TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ELIGIBLE CONCORD NC STUDENTS WILL SEE THEIR BOOKS AND SUPPLY WERE INCREASED FROM. YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BAR THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO CHECK BERMAN- FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THANK YOU MISTER. UP WE HAD THIS AID COMMISSION ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSED AN EXPANSION OF THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS AVAILABLE FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. THIS WOULD ALLOW US AT THE COMMISSION TO SERVE MORE BE ELIGIBLE BUT UNFUNDED STUDENTS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT WERE REFERRED TO A COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT COOL IT ONLY FORTY ONE THOUSAND AWARDS THAT THE COMMISSION WAS AUTHORIZED TO PAY TO STUDENTS. ONLY ONE FOR EVERY SEVEN STUDENTS IN THE COMPETITIVE SCHOOL RECEIVED A GRANT AS A RESULT. OF OR PUT ANOTHER WAY COMPETITIVE PROGRAM DESPITE HAVING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NEED WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY CAL GRANT WORK. WITHOUT EXPANSION. THE COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS INVESTMENT. THE COMMISSION WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS STILL LEAVES MANY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WITHOUT AB NOR WOULD IT PROVIDE ANY PREDICTABILITY MORE CERTAINTY TO THE STUDENTS WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY RECEIVE AN AWARD. THESE NINE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL AWARDS ARE A WELCOME INVESTMENT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET BUT WE ARE HOPING THAT MOVING FORWARD UNDER CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION WHICH WE'LL DISCUSS. IN A FEW AGENDA ITEMS HERE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT RESULT IN SO MANY STUDENTS BEING PLACED IN A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. IN THE FIRST PLACE AND PROVIDE OUR MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH MORE PREDICTABLE ACCESS TO STATE FINANCIAL AID. IN REGARDS TO BE CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARD FOR FOSTER YOUTH PROPOSAL AT WE ALSO WELCOME THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOURCES IDENTIFIED TO SERVICE STUDENT POPULATION THAT WE KNOW FACES SO MANY ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AND THE PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING A LACK OF FAMILY RESOURCES TO DRAW UPON. AS THEY TRIED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE. WE APPRECIATE THAT EXPANDING ACCESS TO AID FOR CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL EVIDENCED BY SEVERAL RECENT EFFORTS- IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO EXPAND. THE ELIGIBILITY PERIODS FOR CURRENT OR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH RECEIVING AID. AND THE COMMISSION IS ALSO PROUD TO ADMINISTER THE CHIEF YOU EDUCATION AND TRAINING DR GRANT PROGRAM. A FEDERALLY AND STATE FUNDED PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBLE FOSTER YOUTH. AS IT RELATES TO IMPLEMENTATION THE COMMISSION WOULD NOTE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A DATA MATCH PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FOR PURPOSES OF VERIFYING THE APPLICANT'S ELIGIBILITY FOR THE GP GRANT PROGRAM THAT I JUST MENTIONED. THIS WOULD HELP US IN THE PROCESS OF CONFIRMING A FINANCIALLY APPLICANTS ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS ENHANCE ACCESS AWARD WITHOUT CREATING AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS UP FOR THE STUDENT APPLYING. AND ALL OF MY COMMENTS FOR NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU THEN WILL GO TO THE L. A. R. THANK YOU. I'LL BE IN THE COMPETITIVE TOP AND WEBER. ASSISTED NEED COMMISSION AS NOTED DEMAND FOR THIS PROGRAM FAR EXCEEDS SUPPLY AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE WAY THIS PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED AS THAT THE AWARDS ONE PROVIDED WOULD BE LARGELY ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO STUDENT NEED. THIS IS A REFLECTION OF THE SCORING MATRIX IS DENIED COMMISSION IS TO PRIORITIZE STUDENTS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND I MAKE A COMPARISON PAGE TWENTY FOUR GANDAK. THREE TWENTY FOUR CAN. THAT WE WANTED TO NOTE. AND NOT SET THE COSTS WOULD INCREASE IN THE OUT YEARS THIS IS A PATTERN WE COMMONLY SEE WHAT PROPOSALS THAT IMPACT ONE INCOMING NEW COHORT OF TARGET RECIPIENTS AT A TIME. BASED ON DATA FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND THAT COSTS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL COULD ROUGHLY DOUBLE BY THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR. WE KNOW HIS BECAUSE WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP THE STATE'S PROJECTED OPERATING DEFICIT IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER SENATE HOW CAN EXTENSION. BUT PARTICULARLY EXPANSION SUCH AS THIS ONE THAT HAVE ESCALATING COSTS. IF THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE WE DO THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS WORTH CONSIDERING FOR THE REASONS NOTED. IT IN FACT THE LINES QUITE CLOSELY WITH RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO EXPAND CONCORD ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO STUDENT MEET. SUPPLEMENTAL AWARDS FOR FOSTER YOUTH. THE KEY BENEFIT WE SEE INNOCENT. THAT WOULD TARGET ADDITIONAL TUITION HE TOOK OF STUDENTS WITH HIGH. NEED THERE ARE COMMON STRUCTURES IS TRY EIGHT IF YOU'RE TO WE DO RAISE ONE. ISSUE HAVE FOR THE LARGEST TO CAN. IN RECENT YEARS LARGEST EXPRESSED INTEREST IN SIMPLIFYING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE. CREATING A SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD FOR SPECIFIC STUDENT GROUPS COULD RUN COUNTER TO HIS INTERESTS AND SIMPLIFICATION. IN THE LONG TERM WE THINK THERE COULD BE SIMPLER MORE SYSTEMATIC OPTIONS TO EXPANDING ON TUITION AID. CURRENTLY AS YOU MAY KNOW WHILE STUDENTS APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ARE SIGNED SOMETHING CALLED AN EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION OR ESC. THIS IS AN INDEX THAT'S INTENDED TO MEASURE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR COLLEGE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOMES SIZE ASSETS. STRUCTURE CURRENTLY THE SYNTAX IS OF LIMITED USE IN PRIORITIZING STUDENTS FOR FINANCIALLY JUST BECAUSE SO MANY STUDENTS ARE CLUSTERED IN THE VERY LOWEST POSSIBLE VALUE. BIAS VERY RECENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION PASSED IN DECEMBER HAS THAT INTEREST IN CHANGES TO THIS MEASURE THAT WE THINK WILL MAKE IT MORE USEFUL AND PRIORITIZING THE VERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN THE TWENTY. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WORK ACT. SO WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE THINK IT OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THIS IN TAX AS A MEANS TO PRIORITIZE STUDENTS FOR NATIONAL AID MOVING FORWARD. ULTIMATELY THE LARGE CHOOSES TO GET HIGH BUT- OUR PRIORITY TO TALK EXTENSION THIS YEAR WE DO THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S. MERITS CONSIDERATION AS IN YOUR TERM OPTION TO EXPANDING IT FOR GROUP OF STUDENTS VERY HIGH NEED. BUT IN THE LONG TERM WEARING COURAGE LEGISLATURE EXPLORE. MORE SYSTEMATIC AND BECOMES A MORE STREAMLINED APPROACHES SUCH AS THE USE OF AN AXE. THANK YOU AFTER TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOB I JUST WOULD NOTE THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ALL THE TESTIMONY AND FEEL LIKE THAT'S- WHAT WAS SAID WAS REALLY EVIDENT IN WILL JUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. TOWARD THE MAY REVISE BUT LET ME ASK. IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. THEN I'M GOING TO IGNORE THAT WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY SENATOR- CHOI BOGUE. AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT SHE WAS AT HOUSING COMMITTEE MEETING AND IT WAS A LACK OF DESIRE. FOR BEING HERE THAT SHE WASN'T HERE TILL NOW. SO WHAT WE'RE GLAD SHE'S HERE. BARM WE ARE COMBINING ISSUE ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN TOGETHER OUT OF THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS INVOLVED- IT WAS A QUESTION OF WHAT ORDER TO TAKE THINGS AND DOES HAPPEN TO BE THE EXACT THREE PANELISTS THAT ARE UP THERE RIGHT NOW SO I THINK WE'LL TAKE ISSUES. ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN TOGETHER THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS AND THEN WILL GO FOR FINAL ITEM BEING THE FINANCIAL AID REFORM UPDATE SO FOR ELEVEN AND THIRTEEN WE HAVE THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS AND AGAIN WE HAVE GABRIELA CHAVEZ JERRY BREMNER AND LIESEGANG AND WILL BEGIN WITH SCARBOROUGH CHAVEZ THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

THIS PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- INCLUDES A STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO RECEIVE DONATIONS BEQUESTS GRANTS AND PHILANTHROPIC FUNDING SUBJECT TO SUCH CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION. MAYBE MY BICYCLE IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. THIS PROPOSAL OUT THE RISE A COMMISSION TO DIRECTLY RECEIVE DONATIONS AND MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. ON A WIDE RANGE OF PROJECTS. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THEN WILL MOVE TO CHECK BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE COMMISSION REQUESTED THESE BONDS FOR THE FINAL DAYS OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF OUR GREAT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THIS IS THE COMMISSION SPINAL FUNDING REQUEST ANTICIPATED FOR THIS PROJECT. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THIS PROJECT IN A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE COMMISSION DUE TO THE VOLUME AND SENSITIVITY OF THE APPLICATIONS WE PROCESS EACH YEAR. AT EACH YEAR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION RECEIVED AS MANY AS TWO MILLION APPLICATIONS AND APPROPRIATES TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN A- PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT. THE COMMISSION WAS USING AN I. T. SYSTEM THAT WAS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD- TO DO ALL THIS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE RISKS THAT THAT POTENTIALLY POSES TO THE STATE. THIS PROJECT ALREADY SEEN MANY FEATURES- THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED ALREADY BY CORD USERS INCLUDING MOST CRITICALLY OUR STUDENTS- THOSE FEATURES ARE NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS AND I'M- HAPPY TO EXPAND ON THOSE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- BUT- WE HAVE LAUNCHED. SEVERAL DIFFERENT. ITERATIONS OF OUR WEB GRANTS PLATFORM FOR STUDENTS AS WELL AS FOR SEVERAL OF OUR SPECIAL PROGRAMS. THERE'S BEEN A DELAY OF A FEW MONTHS TO ALLOW FOR MORE THOROUGH TESTING DURING THIS PERIOD. TO ENSURE THAT THE RELEASE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FACING SIDE OF THE PROJECT IS AS EFFECTIVE AND BUG FREE AS POSSIBLE. AND AS NOTED IN THE MATERIALS WE ANTICIPATE LAUNCHING WEB GRANTS FOR INSTITUTIONS IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR.

ONCE ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH OUR STAFF WITH A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM. REGARDING THE PHONE TALK FUNDS. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS IT'S BECAUSE AND CON. THE ONE WE WOULD KNOW THAT IT DOES CURRENTLY. PROVIDE FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ADDING REQUIREMENT FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO REPORT ANNUALLY AND ANY FUNDS RECEIVED UNDER THE- COAST AUTHORITY. JUST AS THIS WOULD ALLOW IT TO MONITOR EXTERNALLY FUNDED ACTIVITIES ENSURE THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE AS WELL AS PUBLIC INTEREST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH. THEY I DO THINK THAT THE- QUESTION OF A REPORT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN IS- VALID ONE AND MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAY REVISE. OR THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

ARE WILL MOVE TO THE FINAL ITEM ON THE AGENDA- ISSUE TWELVE WHICH IS THE CAL GRANT TO REFORM UPDATE AND WE HAVE MARLENE GARCIA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. AND CHECK BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION COMING BACK AGAIN SIR WELL WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST FOR THE SAKE OF TIME- I'LL BE PRESENTING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATE ON OUR EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE CAL GRANT SYSTEM- THIS PROJECT HAS IN FACT BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING AND AT THE URGING OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CONSISTENT. AND THEIR CALL ON THE STATE TO FIX FINANCIAL AID BY ADDRESSING THE GROWING CHALLENGES NON TUITION COSTS AND REMOVING THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT I REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY TO KEEP SO MANY STUDENTS. OUT OF STATE FINANCIAL AID. THE OUTBREAK OF KOBE NINETEEN OUR STUDENTS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COVER THEIR BASIC NEEDS. FOOD AND HOUSING IN ADDITION TO OTHER. NON TUITION EXPENSES LIKE BOOKS AND TRANSPORTATION. AS YOU'VE HEARD. TODAY I MEAN SENIOR AGENDA MATERIALS WE HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM. OF STATE FINANCIAL AID. DUE TO ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS BASED ON AGE. HOW LONG STUDENTS BEEN OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME OF THEIR APPLICATION FOR AID. AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE FOR TOO MANY OF OURMOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS ARE LEFT OUT OF THE CAL GRANT ALTOGETHER. GIVEN THE DECREASED ENROLLMENT SPEECH SEEN THIS PAST FALL AND YOU DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY. AND THE CONCERNING DROP IN APPLICATION RATES FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID. THEY WERE REFERENCING A PREVIOUS AGENDA ITEM. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT THE STUDENTS ARE DEFERRING THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AND- AND LATER TRIED TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID. WE MAY SEE EVEN LARGER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS REFERRED TO THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY'VE APPLIED MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. THE TAKEN WITH THE EXACERBATING. STUDENTS ARE FACING AND ADDRESSING THEIR BASIC NEEDS MAKES OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION ALL THE MORE CRITICAL. OUR PROPOSAL TO MODERNIZE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS DIRECTLY YOU'RE REFERRING TO AS A CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK SEEKS TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. REDUCING THE LEVELS OF DEBT INCURRED BY STUDENTS. MAKING FINANCIALLY MORE EQUITABLE BY REMOVING ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS AND SETTING THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AS THE BENCHMARK FOR A PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS LEVERAGING FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING SOURCES TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR STUDENTS. WE EQUITY FRAMEWORK PROPOSES CONSOLIDATING THE VARIOUS CAL GRANT PROGRAMS INTO JUST YOU. A CAL GRANT TO THAT SERVICE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND CAL GRANT FORD THAT WOULD SERVE STUDENTS ENROLLED AT THE OTHER SEGMENTS. AS YOU. MAY KNOW THAT PROMISE GRANT FORMERLY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS BE WAIVER ALREADY PROVIDES TUITION D. COVERAGE FOR OVER 40% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. HOWEVER THERE'S VERY LITTLE AID AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS. WE PROPOSE A BIT CAL GRANT TO PROVIDE ALL ELIGIBLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH ZERO EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION. THE MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS IDENTIFIED IN OUR EIGHT APPLICATIONS WITH A STIPEND FOR NON TUITION COSTS. THIS WOULD ELIMINATE EXISTING BARRIERS BASED ON A STUDENT'S AGE TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M TRYING TO SERVE ADULT LEARNERS WE WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR GPA VERIFICATION. AS SECURING HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT CAN BECOME A BARRIER TO AID FOR. YOU NEED PRO FOR COMMUTER COLLEGE WITH LET US THAT AN APPLE. DEADLINE OF SEPTEMBER SECOND. FOR THE TELEPRINTER PROGRAM RELATIVE TO THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE A MARCH SECOND DEADLINE. AND THIS WOULD REFLECT THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO STUDENTS WITHOUT THE EARLIER ADMISSIONS DEADLINES USED OTHER SEGMENTS. ALL TOGETHER IN DOING THIS WE COULD EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT TO AWARD BY MORE THAN A NUMBER OF STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANT. FROM HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS UNDER CURRENT RULES TODAY TO TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ONE OF YOUR APPLICATIONS. IN THE MATERIALS TO BE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE YOU'LL SEE THAT WE PLAYED OUT FUNDING OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION AND HOW MUCH AID WOULD BE BECOME AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. TODAY APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND CAL GRANT FUNDS GO TO NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE RECIPIENTS EACH YEAR. WITH THOSE FUNDS WE COULD OFFER CALL ZERO DSC ELIGIBLE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH A ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR CAL GRANT WORK. THE CURRENT CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD FOR OUR- EYES ARE ONLY NON TUITION ASSISTANCE AWARD. PROVIDES ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DOLLARS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. TO MAINTAIN AN AWARD OF THAT SIZE FOR THE CAL GRANT YOU WOULD REQUIRE FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING. WE WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED A GROWTH INDEX OR OTHER METRICS BE ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE THAT THE CAL GRANT TO KEEP TRACK WITH NON TUITION COSTS AND MAINTAINS THE AWARDS PURCHASING POWER. OVER TIME. OUR CAL GRANT FOR PROGRAM WOULD SERVE STUDENTS ENROLLED AT ALL OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. STUDENTS WITH AN ESC QUALIFYING THEM FOR A PELL GRANT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A CALTRAIN FOR. THE CALGARY FOR WOULD MAITAIN THE EXISTING TUITION AND FEES COVERAGE FOR STUDENTS AT OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS THE CURRENT AWARD LEVELS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED AT PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER WE WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS BASED ON AGE AND TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE A CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD SO INSTEAD WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT INSTITUTIONS UTILIZE INSTITUTIONAL AID. TO PROVIDE ZERO ESE STUDENTS WITH A STIPEND TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR BASIC NEEDS. BY ELIMINATING NON FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS AND CONVERTING TO A TUITION AND FEE- AWARD STRUCTURE WE CAN CUT OFF FOR MORE THAN A FOR OVER FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WITH THE CAL GRANT FORWARD. RELATIVE TO TODAY'S CAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS. ALL JUST BRIEFLY NOTE THAT AT NO POINT ON ARE WE PROPOSING TO CUT OFF STUDENTS WERE CURRENTLY RECEIVING AID TODAY WE WOULD- PROPOSED TRANSITION AS WE TRANSITION TO THE NEW CALTRAIN EQUITY FRAMEWORK. THAT THE STUDENTS BE ALLOWED TO GRANDFATHER INTO THEIR EXISTING PROGRAM UNTIL THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR AID SHOULD EXPIRE. THE COST OPTIONS WE PRESENTED ALSO REFLECT- THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION LEVELS FOR STUDENTS AT EACH SEGMENT AND WE NOT SHOULD THE DOLLARS FROM ONE SEGMENT TOWARDS ANOTHER. IN LOOKING AT WHICH STUDENTS WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE CAL GRANT THROUGH THIS EXPANSION THE RECIPIENTS OF THE CAL RIGHT TO WEAR CROWN GOT FORWARD WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN TODAY'S STUDENTS TO BE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOERS. ADULT LEARNERS STUDENT PERRANCE. AND THEY WOULD ALSO BE LOWER INCOME AND MORE DIVERSE THAN TODAY'S RECIPIENTS. THESE STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM TODAY'S PROGRAM STUDENT ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT I'VE BEEN REFERENCING ABOUT REMARKS. TO CONCLUDE I'D LIKE TO OFFER YOU WITH WHAT THE COMMISSION SEES AS THE KEY OUTCOMES WE CAN ACHIEVE IN ADOPTING A CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK. WE CAN STREAMLINE THE CURRENT SEVEN CAL GRANT PROGRAMS SO THEY'RE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD BY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS COMMUNICATED BY COUNCILLORS. WE CAN ALIGN THE ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE COHESIVE AND COORDINATED. WE CAN ELIMINATE THE ELIGIBILITY BEAR YOUR STATE THAT ARE DISCONNECTED FROM QUESTIONS OF FINANCE AND IN DOING SO WE CAN TARGET STATE RESOURCES FOR MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENTS. MORE TANGIBLY CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK WOULD YIELD OVER ONE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS THAN TODAY SYSTEM IN ONE YEAR OF APPLICATIONS AND CALIFORNIA COULD BETTER LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING BY CONVERTING TO TUITION AND FEES AWARDS IN THE CAL GRANT FOR PROGRAM. WITH FORTY THOUSAND MORE TUITION VIEW WARDS THERE WOULD BE FORTY THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT WOULD RECEIVE A TEN OF FUNDED BENEFIT AND BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR CALFRESH FEDERALLY FUNDED BENEFITS. THIRTY HIGHER NUMBERS% OF STUDENTS PARENTS ADULT LEARNERS IN CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION FILERS ELIGIBLE FOR AID. AND CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK MAKES OUR CAL GRANT SYSTEM MORE INCLUSIVE PARTICULARLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS. SO I I'D LIKE TO INCLUDING HERE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I'M I KNOW WE'VE SHARED A LOT IN THE MATERIALS AND- TRY TO COVER A LOT OF BROWN IN THESE REMARKS BRIEF REMARKS TODAY. SO WE WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS AND I'M ALSO JOINED BYMY COLLEAGUE PATRICK PERRY ART DIRECTOR DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATA OR THE MODELING THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A QUESTION BUT BEFORE I ASK IT- I'M GOING TO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THIS AND SO. WHOEVER THINKS THEY MIGHT HAVE THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE% DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOULD ON MUTE THEMSELVES AND THEN ALL ASK THEM AFTER. ASKING MISTER BURNER. THAN. MISTER BURNER YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT YOU'VE GOT LOT OF FOR. OUT IN YOUR- IN OUR LIKE TO STAY BACK A LITTLE. AND JUST ARE MORE LOW PUT IT INTO CON. BECAUSE OF ONE THING SOUNDED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. WHICH IS THAT WE WOULD- DEAL WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL COST. TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AND HAVE MORE PEOPLE AND I THINK THERE'S A CONTINUE ON HERE ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS SORT OF TRYING TO FIX THE BARRIERS THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM. AND THEN IT'S TRYING TO AT SOME POINT EXPAND TO MORE WRAPAROUND TO REFORM. THAT INCLUDES THINGS THAT ARE JUST FEES BUT BOXER HOUSING FOR OTHER ISSUES. AND I JUST WONDERED WHAT IS THE CONTINUE ON HERE WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING OR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. AND THE HARD QUESTION IT'S LIKE WHAT'S THE COST. IN GENERAL AND- WHERE WOULD YOU LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS WE DON'T GET AND WHERE WOULD IT. BE A GREATER COST TO THE STATE. A VERY GOOD QUESTION MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR POINTS ARE VERY WELL TAKEN- WE DO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION BELIEVE THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE- BOTH SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE FINANCIALLY. AS WELL AS EXPAND THE SUPPORT THAT WE CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. I IS YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS NOTED I'M WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO- STUDY HOW WE COULD BETTER STRUCTURE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S STUDENTS- THOSE EFFORTS HAD YIELDED A REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY JUST BEFORE KOBE NINETEEN AT. AND THAT PROPOSAL WAS TABLED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. OVER THE SUMMER OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS ASKED THAT WE LOOK AT HOW WE COULD MODEL THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION LEVELS AS THEY STOOD IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY. TO REFLECT THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS ISSUED IN MARCH. BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS. AN URGENCY TO NOT ONLY SIMPLIFYING THE SYSTEM AND REMOVING THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS BUT BRINGING TO BEAR GREATER RESOURCES THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN COVERING THOSE BASIC NEEDS AND NON TUITION COSTS. THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED. ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND IT SPEAKS TO THE QUESTION YOU POSED AROUND THE FEDERAL RESOURCES. IS AROUND THE NATURE OF OUR- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES. FUNDING AND THE CALFRESH PROGRAM- AS PART OF THE- PROCESS FOR AWARDING US. WHO RECEIVED A TUITION AND FEE AWARD- FOR THE CALGARY PROGRAM CURRENTLY WE ALSO NOTIFIED THE STUDENTS THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED UP. BENEFIT THAT'S BEEN FUNDED IN PART BY A TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES FUNDING AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THERE'S AN EXISTING RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE FOR THE FEDERAL SNAP PROGRAM OR FOOD STAMPS THAT PREVENT MANY STUDENTS WITH- OFTEN VERY DIRE FINANCIAL NEED WHAT WILL MR BURDEN OR LET ME PUT A FINER POINT ON IT. CAN YOU DO THE REFORMS. TO JUST ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS. AND ADD MORE PEOPLE BY ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS. AND NOT CHANGING SORT OF THE GRANT SYSTEM. CAN YOU DO THAT WITH AN EXISTING FUNDS. WE'VE LAID OUT IN OUR MATERIALS THAT WE PROVIDED HE- RAMIFICATIONS FOR MOVING TOWARDS THIS CAL GRANT YOU WIN FOR SYSTEM WITH EXISTING RESOURCES- WE DO BELIEVE THAT I WENT IN AND IS IT THE IF YOU MOVE TOWARD IT WITH EXISTING RESOURCES YOU CAN COVER LESS PEOPLE. FOR YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO USE THE EXISTING RESOURCES AND LOWER THE BARRIERS AND COVER MORE PEOPLE AND MAKE IT ALL WORK WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES. YES MISTER JEFFREY PLAYED OUT BE OPTION AND IN THE- RESOURCES ARE JUST NOT EVERYBODY HAS BENEFIT OF YOUR STAFF REPORTER WHAT YOU'VE LAID OUT THERE JUST LISTENING AND I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO TELL THEM WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS. MISTER CHAIR NO IT'S NO PROBLEM I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP AT IT TILL I GET THERE. WE WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL SO AND USING THE EXISTING FUNDS THAT ARE APPROPRIATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. WE COULD EXPAND THAT BASE OF STUDENTS- I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND GETS ITS WATER EIGHTY THOUSAND. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS PROBLEM- HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TODAY. BUT THE RAMIFICATIONS THERE IS THAT THERE WILL BE A SMALLER AWARD THAT WE WOULD OFFER TO STUDENTS IT WOULD BE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR WARD. RATHER THAN THE CURRENT ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX DOLLARS OR AND I WAS THERE WAS ONE I WAS I WANT TO GET TO THE SECOND CALL BACK TO THE SECOND QUESTION BUT- WHEN I WAS BUDGET CHAIR. IN THE ASSEMBLY A DECADE AGO. I WAS THE ARCHITECT OF A FEE ROLL BACK FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IT ALWAYS MAY DELAY- CRAZY BECAUSE THE L. A- WANTED CHEESE TO GO UP AND HAVE THE PELL GRANT BE THE THING THAT. THAT REALLY BENEFITED AND THOUGHT THE FEE ROLLBACK WAS NEEDLESS AND WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THE OHIO. IS THAT STILL IN PLAY WITH REGARD TO LEVERAGING FEDERAL GRANTS AND HAVING THE FEDERAL GRANTS PAY MORE FEES IF WE RAISE THE FEES FOR PEOPLE THAT. ARE IN THAT INCOME CATEGORY. BUT IN THE- PROPOSAL WE PUT FORTH WE WOULD ENVISIONED THE PROMISE GRANT WOULD TO COVERAGE AND- HELLO WOULD BE UP AT THE END GENEALOGY OF ACRONYMS THE PROMISE GRANT IS THE SUCCESSOR TO THE BALL GRUYTER BRYANT. OKAY JUST FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING AT HOME. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- MISTER CHAIR SO THE PROMISE GRANT FORMERLY THE FEE WAIVER WOULD CONTINUE TO COVER TUITION AND FEES FOR- THAT POPULATION. TWO WOULD THEN BE LATER TO TALK BACK TO HELP SUPPORT STUDENTS WITH THEIR NON TUITION COSTS AND WITH THEIR BASIC NEEDS NOW TO GO TO THE SECOND QUESTION. IF YOU WERE TO FOLLOW THE REFORM. THAT RELY WRAPS AROUND OTHER THINGS SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST FEES BUT YOU START TO GET TO HOUSING OR BOOKS OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REALLY WHERE PEOPLE RACK UP THE DEBT. BOMB THAT WHERE IF YOU WANT TO THAT. IS EITHER SUBSTANTIAL. THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE THOSE THINGS AND REDUCE THE GRANT SO IT'S REALLY YOU'RE ADDING ACOSTA CHIU HOPE WILL. BE COVERED FROM SOMEWHERE RIGHT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE COULD AS A AS I A NOTE WE CAN TO THAT FIFTY NO DOLLARS AND SPREAD ACROSS ADDITION STUDENTS. THAT WOULD YIELD- LOWER AWARDED THAT IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM OUR WE DO BELIEVE THAT WITH THAT TARGETED INVESTMENT. THE FORTY SIX MILLION THAT IDENTIFIED AN ONGOING RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE AWARD AMOUNT WE CAN GO EVEN FURTHER IN OUR EFFORTS TO SERVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WE KNOW AS AS USUAL HERE TO REALLY. WHAT YOUR DESCRIBING IS A PARTIALLY SELF DEFEATING SITUATION WHERE YOU EXPAND THE GRANTS TO COVER OTHER COSTS FOR THERE'S NO DEBT WHICH OF TO LOWER THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT TO EXPAND THE GRANTS TO. LOWER THE AMOUNT OF THE GRANT TO EXPAND GRANTS TO PEOPLE THAT'S SORT OF THE PREMISE RIGHT. I MEAN WITHOUT A- REVENUE GEN. OR REVENUE YOU COULD CHANGE WORLD BUT THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE DYNAMIC CORRECT. AT YES MR JERRY NOW THE REQUEST WE RECEIVE FROM OUR LOW WITH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BEAT COULD BE A WITHIN THE FOR WHAT AND THEN TO IDENTIFY IT IS RESOURCE WOULD BE NO TO ADD OR YOUR ORDER MAIL OR GROW THAT AWARD AMOUNTS TO GO EVEN GREATER. OF KNOWLEDGE AND COSTS THANK YOU AND THEN THE REYES I ASK FOR AND- BREANNA BURNS HAS MAGICALLY APPEARED HERE AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN OR STAFF IF YOU'D- ON ANY POSITION FINANCER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. BOND GRANT REFORM. SORRY BRIANNA FRIENDS DIFFERENT FINANCE YOU FOR YOUR- I THIS POINT WE DO NOT HAVE. A FORMAL POSITION TO RECOMMEND. ON THIS TO EIGHT STRUCTURE. WE ARE STILL. AND LOOKING- OF THE IN THE CASE THAT AND MY CALL WAS DIFFERENT- HAS JUST IDENTIFIED. SO WE'RE STILL IN THE AND NOW. BY AT THIS TIME. CAN WELL IT WILL. ARM FULLY OF WHAT GOVERNOR'S DURING CAMPAIGN SO YOU LIKE IF. THE CONDO DOESN'T TANK YOU PREVIOUS TO HELP WITH THE SO- THAT WOULD BE A GOOD AND I KNOW. THAT. CENTER OCHO BOCA JOINED AND- MISSED ASKING A AND ITEMS. B. SHE WAS A ANOTHER CA HEARING BUT IT TURNS THAT COULD. MIGHT RELATE TO THIS AND I THINK BACK. WHAT HAVE GONE TO BERMAN. SO I'M GONNA RECOGNIZE ROACH BOGUE LETTER ASPECT. A SEE IF IT. TO WORK THIS. GOOD MORNING AND I POWER. FOR MISSING THE FIRST OF THE COMMITTEE. I WAS IN A- ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEETING SCHEDULE JUST SLIGHTLY BEFORE TIME- I DO HAVE. A WITH TO- THIS CAL GRANT WITH. AND FAST SO. PUBLIC PROCESS IS MY- THAT WE CURRENTLY- IN THE PAST YEARS LEFT OVER. I FIRED CORRECTLY FIVE HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS AT THE TABLE BECAUSE OF STILL NOT A FOR FASTER. AND IN. IN CONTEXT OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FOR- DARIUS NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND GOING INTO- HIGHER EDUCATION I'M KIND OF WONDERING IF. ONE DO WE KNOW WHY THE FASTER APPLICATION PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN A- A REQUISITE FOR ALL OF OUR SENIORS- GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL MOVING FORWARD WHY THEY HAVEN'T THAT ONE HASN'T BEEN A REQUISITE FOR MOST OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TO APPLY FOR THE FASTA APPLICATION WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO- MEET MEANT MUCH OF THE NEEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE ADDRESSING RIGHT NOW WITH ALL OF THE REFORMS AND WITHIN THAT PROCESS. WITH THE CAL GRANT BE EFFECTED BY I'M NOT AFFECTED BY GUESTS INCLUDED WITHIN THAT THOSE MONIES. THANK YOU GREAT QUESTION SENATOR. TAKE THEM UP IN PART AND HOPEFULLY I CAN ALL OF COULD BE A QUICK THAT YOU HAD- DID FUNDS THAT YOU. THAT ARE BEING LET ON THE TWO LIKE STUDENTS WHO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID WOULD INCLUDE STATE AND FEDERAL AID SOURCES AND THE SAME APPLICATIONS THAT WE USE FOR THE PAST- OR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT. PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL AID AND FOR STATE SO IN HELP BRING MORE STUDENTS COMPLETE. THOSE APPLICATIONS WE HELP THEM NOT ONLY ACCESS THE STATE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BUT ALSO THAT FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE REFERENCED EARLIER- I WOULD. HAVE TO PROBABLY DEFERRED OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR- YOU KNOW WHY DON'T KNOW WHY THAT THE REQUIREMENT WAS IN PLACE PREVIOUSLY I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED IN OTHER STATES I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S ALSO. IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR REQUIREMENT TO HELP MORE OF THEIR STUDENTS COMPLETE AND THAT THAT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL UNDERTAKING- BUT- MAY HAVE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE- TIMING OF THE PROPOSAL. FINANCED WITH LIKE TO THAT. SORRY BRIANNA FRIEND DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND REGIONAL I CAN'T ON YOU KNOW WHY IT BEEN A TODAY- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS FOR IS TRULY FOR ON A AND DEBT ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BY TO OUR TEAM WE UNDER. THAT THEY IS MONEY LEFT ON THE TEAM AND WE THAT THAT PROPOSAL WE HAVE CURRENTLY INTO BUILDING ISN'T APPROACH- TO YOU KNOW THE FEELING. OF AFTER REQUIRE SO YEAH I CAN SPEAK TO THE WHY INCLUDED IN THIS BY THAT CAN SPEAK TO WHITE HOUSE BEEN INCLUDE TO DATE. THAT AT QUESTIONS WANNA FALL UP WITH. BUDGET WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDER. CORRECT SO THESE MAY. THAT ARE. LEFT AT THE TABLE. WOULD WE ADDITIONAL. AND TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND ARCEUS USER UC'S WOULD WE NEED THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY. IF THESE IF THESE MONIES FROM THE FIVE SEVEN CAL AB FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE. FROM THE CALIFORNIA FROM CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD THEY MEET THOSE NEEDS ARE DOING IS THAT IN ADDITION TO. UTILIZING ARE MAXIMIZING THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. THROUGH THE FASTER PROGRAM. THANK YOU SENATOR. IF THERE SHOULD BE AN INCREASE IN THE APPLICATION RATES- FOR STUDENTS WHICH WE WOULD ENVISION UNDER THIS PROPOSALOF COURSE THERE WOULD BE RAMIFICATIONS ON OUR- POTENTIALLY ON OUR COST ESTIMATES FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BECAUSE MORE STUDENTS WOULD BE APPLYING UNDER THE HIGH SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TODAY FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE APPLYING WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION. THE IMPACT THERE IS HARD TO ASSESS RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL- UNDERTAKING THOSE EFFORTS AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION- BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND THE APPLICATION RATES FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS THIS YEAR VERY LIKELY DUE TO THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE WE WOULD HAVE A FEW COUNTERVAILING FACTORS AS WE TRY TO. DEVELOP A COST ESTIMATE FOR- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS- HOLDING IN MIND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS REQUIREMENT- BE DEDUCTED IN THE STATE BUDGET ACT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.
