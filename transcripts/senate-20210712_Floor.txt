WE ARE. CLOSING OUT THE SUMMER SEPTEMBER WOULD BE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER IN SEPTEMBER IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY FOR ALL OF US. A LATINO VETERANS I SPEAK UP. I RISE MADAM PRESIDENT TO PRESENT SENATE SEVEN WHICH PROCLAIMS SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS LATINO VETERANS DAY IN CALIFORNIA. S. C. R. THIRTY SEVEN PAYS TRIBUTE AND HONOR THE LATINO MEN AND WOMEN SERVING ACROSS ALL BRANCHES OF OUR ARMED FORCES PAST AND PRESENT WHO HAVE DEVOTED SO MUCH TO OUR COUNTRY LATINO HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY. THROUGHOUT HISTORY OF AMERICA THERE ARE COUNTLESS STORIES OF LATINOS OFFERING THEIR SERVICE AND OFTEN GIVING THEIR LIVES. IN THAT SERVICE. WHETHER IT BE A PART OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ROUGHRIDERS THE NATIONAL GUARD REGIMENT. FOR THE SIXTY FIFTH INFANTRY REGIMENT LATINOS HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN VITAL TO PART OF OUR ARMED FORCES. TODAY LATINOS MAKE UP 15% OF AMERICA'S FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN. PLANE GROUPM THE PROVIDING CRITICAL ROLES IN EVERY MAJOR AMERICAN CONFLICT SINCE THE CIVIL WAR IN FACT LATINO VETERANS HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR OVER SIXTY TIMES MORE THAN ANY OTHER ETHNIC GROUP IN AMERICA. THIS DISTINGUISHED MILITARY RECORDS OF LATINOS AS A MARKER OF THEIR INCREDIBLE DEDICATION THIS COUNTRY THEY FOUGHT FOR A NATION THAT DID NOT ALWAYS SEE THEM AS EQUAL OFTEN SEGREGATING THEM OR DENYING THEM JOBS THAT WE'RE WORTHY OF THEIR SKILLS. ALL BECAUSE OF THEIR ORIGIN OF THEIR ANCESTORS YET THEY STILL FOUGHT SERVED WITH HONOR THE DEAD OF OUR GRATITUDE CAN NEVER BE REPAID BUT IT CAN BE A KNOWLEDGE. MAY WE HONOR THE SERVICE AND DEDICATION OF THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH TO OUR FREEDOM REMEMBER IN OUR LATINO MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE THIS GREAT COUNTRY FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ONCE S. C. R. THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETAMEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. BETTER PRESENT LATER DOWN THE CENTER IF YOU'D LIKE TO PAY A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA HONOR TO THESE VETERANS. RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. IN THE CIRCLE OVER THERE BETWEEN THE SP ONE AND SP TWO TODAY YOU CAN MEET AT LAST THERE IS A STATUTE RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE PEACE OFFICER MEMORIAL CULTURAL DONALD. PEOPLE DON'T MUCH NOTICE THAT STATUTE BUT IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO GO AND- PAY RESPECT TO VICTIMS AND THESE. LATINO SOLDIERS THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE A- OF SOCIALIZATION I'VE WORKED WITH FOR A LOT OF YEARS CALLED THE G. I. FORM. AND THESE ARE HISPANIC BAPTISTS AND THEY STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LADIES IN GENERAL I MUST RISE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS RESOLUTION. NOVEMBER ELEVENTH IS VETERANS DAY FOR ALL AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE YOUR GENDER. IT DOESN'T MATTER NOVEMBER ELEVENTH IS THE DAY THAT WE RECOGNIZE ALL OF OUR VETERANS AND THE SACRIFICES THEY HAVE MADE. BUT TINA VETERANS HISTORICALLY HAVE SERVED IN OUR MILITARY IN A NON SEGREGATED MILITARY- THAT IS NOT TRUE. FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN VETERANS- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN WHO CAME IN UNDER SEGREGATED MILITARY. THEY WENT O THEIR BASIC TRAINING THEY WENT ON TO THEIR- REGIMENS AND IT WAS SEGREGATED. AND WE DON'T HAVE A VETERANS DAY SET ASIDE. FOR JUST BLACK AMERICANS WE DON'T HAVE ONE SET ASIDE JUST FOR ASIAN AMERICANS WE DON'T HAVE ONE SET ASIDE FOR ANY OTHER GROUP OF AMERICANS YET TODAY WERE CONTEMPLATING SETTING ASIDE A- ANOTHER VETERANS DAY SPECIFICALLY FOR LATINO VETERANS- AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE THOUGH- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE PRIDE WITH WHICH THE AUTHOR SPEAKS- AND I UNDERSTAND THE- INTENT BEHIND IT. WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT OUR MILITARY IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE- THE BASIS IS UNITY WHEN YOU JOIN THE MILITARY YOU DON'T JOIN. A PARTICULAR MILITARY YOU DON'T JOIN A LATINO MILITARY OR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MILITARY ASIAN MILITARY YOU'RE ALL ONE. IT'S LIKE STAYING IN THE ARMY YOU'RE ALL GREEN RIGHT. AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS THAT'S HOW WE'RE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IF IN THE MILITARY. WE STARTED. KIND OF SELF DIVIDING ONE ANOTHER THE WHOLE THING FALLS APART YOU HAVE TO HAVE UNITY YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO AN ORGANISATION UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM THAT YOU'RE ALL WORKING TOWARD. THE SAME MISSION. AND WHEN PEOPLE START TO SEE THEMSELVES IN VIEW THEIR SERVICE. DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THEIR PEERS. IT MAKES THE JOB MORE DIFFICULT AND THE ONE THING THAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY DEPENDS ON IS THAT WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT IS UNITED NOT ONLY YOU KNOW PHYSICALLY GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY. IN THIS RESOLUTION THOUGH IT DOESN'T. PHYSICALLY SEGREGATE OUR TROOPS IT IS A PSYCHOLOGICAL SEGREGATION WHEN YOU START TO TELL ONE GROUP THAT THEIR SERVICE IS SO MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN THOSE OF THE OTHERS THAT THEY GET A SEPARATE DAY AND I THINK THAT IS NOT THE MESSAGE THAT WE WANT TO SEND. I'M CERTAIN THAT THAT'S NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF PUTTING FORWARD A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR I MUST OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR MELINDA'S SENATOR AIKMAN. I THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I- I RISE IN UPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. AND YOU KNOW AS A AS A LATINA AS A WOMAN AS A VETERAN- I CAN BE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND STILL BE A PROUD AMERICAN AS I AM AND A PROUD VETERAN. BUT YOU KNOW IT IS NOT HARD FOR ME TO STAND FOR VETERANS ON VETERANS DAY AND I DO THAT. AND IT'S NOT HARD FOR ME TO STAND FOR LATINOS ON THE TUESDAY AND I DIDN'T DO THAT AND FOR WOMEN'S DAY. AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES LIKE UNITY WE CAN LOOK AROUND AND I CAN NO THE GENERAL ROSS WOULD STAND FOR ME. AND I CAN LOOK AROUND I CAN KNOW THAT CAPTAIN NEWMAN WOULD STAND FOR ME. I CAN LOOK AROUND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I KNOW I WOULD STAND WITH THEM AND THEY KNOW THAT. AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE- PEOPLE TRY TO SAY WE'RE SEGREGATING OURSELVES WE'RE RECOGNIZING. I THINK IN RECOGNIZING THAT. PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE. IN FAMILY MEMBERS AND SERVICE. A LOT OF PRIDE IN THEIR CULTURE AND WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE. ARE MELDED TOGETHER. I KNOW FROM Y FAMILY WHO CAME OVER AS IMMIGRANTS AND PROUDLY SERVED. AND MY FAMILY UP UP. WITH THE PICTURES OF OUR LADY WAR LUPE AND THE POPE- AND JFK WAS ALSO MY UNCLES. IN PROUDLY IN THEIR UNIFORMS. AND IT WAS A REAL THING OF HONOR IN MY FAMILY AND WHEN I WENT TO THE MILITARY. IT WAS A THING OF HONOR FOR ME AS WELL. SO WHERE WE STAND AS AMERICANS WE STAND FOR ALL OF US. RIGHT WHEN WE STAND IN UNITY WE STAND NOT TO. DIVIDE AND IT JUST FEELS A- BOMB. AT THAT I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH THAT CENTER ARCHULETA TODAY AND I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH ANYBODY. WHO HAS SERVED THIS COUNTRY. AND DESERVES A LITTLE BIT OF RECOGNITION. THANK YOU SENATOR AIKMAN SAID AWAY SO. THANK YOU. HELLO ARE THERE CAN I OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO RISE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT BEING INCLUDED IN THE MID IN MILITARY SERVICE AND NOT SEGREGATED I THINK THAT REALLY DOES NOT DO SERVICE TO WHAT REALLY HAS HAPPENED IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY DESPITE. OF THE- HISPANICS AND LATINOS SERVING. IN IN MILITARY IN THE MILITARY AND BEING INTEGRATED THIRTY EIGHT THEY SUFFERED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RACISM. IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA INCLUDING BEING PASSED UP FOR IMPORTANT METALS AND PROMOTIONS RIGHT NOW THE LARGEST GROWING ETHNIC GROUP IN THE MILITARY ARE ARE LATINOS AND LATINO ORIGIN. YET THEY ARE NOT ACHIEVING RANK AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS AND THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW. OUR MILITARY IS BEING RUN. AND WHETHER LATINOS ARE GIVING- ARE BEING GIVEN A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN POSITIONS OF RANK IN POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP. IN OUR MILITARY WE KNOW THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED. HISTORICALLY AND WE NEED TO RAISE AWARENESS THAT THAT IS HAS HAPPENED AND THAT IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE RANKS OF OUR MILITARY. BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT STORY TO BE TOLD ABOUT LATINO SERVING IN IN IN THE MILITARY THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT STORY TO BE TOLD ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS AND ASIAN AMERICANS ALL OF THEM HAVE PROVIDED. A UNIQUE ADVANTAGE IN THE AREA OF IN IT INTERNATIONAL CAMP- CAMPAIGNS ARE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND KEEP OUR COUNTRY ON TOP IN TERMS OF MILITARY MIGHT AND POWER. AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF US UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THERE IS A STORY TO BE TOLD AND YOU SHOULD BE TOLD. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF THAT STORY. ON UNITING US THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS TO RAISE. AWARENESS ABOUT LATINOS HAVING HAD CONTRIBUTED. TO MAKING THIS COUNTRY GREAT DON'T BE AFRAID OF RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION THAT. LATINOS HAVE MADE AND DON'T BE AFRAID OF RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTION THAT EVERYONE HAS MADE. AND THIS IS NOT AN EFFORT TO DENY BUT TO TELL THE STORY AND TO REALLY LOOK AT A GROUP THAT. HAS DISTINGUISHES ITSELF FROM MILITARY SERVICE TODAY IN IN WORLD WAR TWO PROPORTIONATELY. ONE OF THE% MOST. RECOGNIZED GROUPS IN TERMS OF VALOR AND MEDALS OF VALOR HAVE BEEN LATINOS EVEN IF THEY WERE PASSED OVER FOR IMPORTANT RECOGNITIONS THEY STILL DOMINATED IN THE AREA OF VALOR AND MAKING THE ULTIMATE THIS COUNTRY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD THAT HISTORY CANNOT BE FORGOTTEN. AND I PRAISE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR HIS MILITARY SERVICE AND FOR HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. IN A VERY DISTINGUISHED WAY. HISTORY NEEDS TO BE TOLD TO SELL I RECOMMEND AND I VOTE FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU SENT AWAY SO BUT SENATOR DRAWS SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. OF THIS- RIGHT NOW THERE IS A GENTLEMAN OF VETERAN. SOMEONE PASTORAL WHO'S WALKING THE BORDER TO RAISE THE ISSUE. OF IMMIGRANTS ESPECIALLY LATINO IMMIGRANT VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. IMAGINE THAT. VETERANS WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES SACRIFICED THEIR LIVESSACRIFICED EVERYTHING FOR THIS NATION AND THEY'RE DEPORTED. THAT IS WHAT IS STILL GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND RAISE THE ISSUE SUCH AS THE AUTHOR HAS DONE IN A VERY RESPECTFUL WAY WITH THIS NATION FOR THIS COUNTRY THAT WE ALL LOVE. WE STILL HAVE TO RAISE THESE ISSUES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT TREAT ANYBODY LESS THAN ANYBODY ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SAID ARCHER ARCHER LET YOU MAKE CLOTHES I'D LIKE TO THANK MY FELLOW SENATORS FOR STANDING UP. AND I WILL SHARE A LITTLE BIT I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF YOU KNOW OR MAY NOT KNOW I WAS A PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEE TO THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT. APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. WHEN I WAS SENT THERE HE SAID LET'S MAKE WEST POINT LOOK LIKE AMERICA WHEN I GOT THERE IT SURELY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE AMERICA I ASKED THE THREE STAR GENERAL THE SUPERINTENDENT.

BOTH WON A CLASS PRESIDENT WANT TO GE- A CLASS PRESIDENT FOUR YEARS APART. THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND I HAVE A NEPHEW AT WEST POINT RIGHT NOW. AND HE WAS GIVEN THE TASK OF SERVING WITH THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE DURING THE SUMMER BREAK. AND WHAT HE'S TOLD ME IS THAT A KEBAB. YOU KNOW I WAS THERE AT FORT BRAGG NORTH CAROLINA. TENET AND I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS AMAZED AT THE NUMBER OF LATINO PARATROOPERS THAT WERE IN THE EIGHTY SECOND AIRBORNE. WOW THEY COME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING I SAID YOU JUST CONTINUE YOUR JOB. IN ONE DAY MAYBE YOU'LL JUMP ON AIRPLANES TO LIKE OLD UNCLE BOB. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS LADIES IN GERMAN. IF YOU HEARD THE RESOLUTION I SAID SIXTY CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR. THAT MEANS THAT GOD ALMIGHTY HOW MANY LOST THEIR LIVES ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY. WE'RE ONLY ASKING FOR RESIGNATION OF RECOGNITION OF SEPTEMBER THE TWENTIETH. WE'RE ASKING FOR RECOGNITION RECOGNITION OF THOSE LATINOS WHO SERVED MEN AND WOMEN. WHO NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR SERVICE. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAY THANK YOU. AND MY SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I'VE HEARD THE STORY.

FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHO KNOWS ONE THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED MEMBERS WE'RE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM FORTY SIX SENATOR PAM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR PAN RELATIVE TO THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT SENATOR PAM THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT S. C. R. FIFTY ONE RECOGNIZING THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICTS TWENTY THIRTY ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS GOAL WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I THINK AS WE LOOK ABOUT US WE SEE THE WILD FIRES WE THINK ABOUT THE TEMPERATURES THAT WE EXPERIENCE THIS WEEKEND HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE ACTUALLY THINK HIT THEIR SECOND HIGHEST TEMPERATURE. ON RECORD DOWNTOWN CHECK ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTEEN DEGREES WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE HAVE BEEN STEPPING UP TO SAY THAT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE HERE IN CAIFORNIA BUT ALSO WHAT'S REALLY ALSO IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE PASSED HERE IT RAN THIS VERY CHAMBER TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WE AS A STATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HERE WE ARE IN THE CAPITAL WE HAVE STREET STATE OFFICES THROUGHOUT THIS REGION AND ACROSS THE STATE THE STATE ITSELF ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN SHOWING OTHER EMPLOYERS HOW TO MINIMIZE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN ADDITION HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITAL I KNOW THAT WE'VE TAKEN STEPS A. AND I REMEMBER- OUR GOOD FRIEND FROM BERKELEY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BERKELEY AND HER LEADERSHIP ROLE AND GETTING- ADDRESSING ISSUES HERE TO CAPITAL ON TERMS OF ALSO REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. OF OUR STATE CAPITAL BUT THE UNDERLYING ALL OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AT LEAST HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND OTHER VARIOUS OFFICE BUILDINGS. ARE POWERED BY THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND SO AS- THE SENATOR REPRESENTING THIS AREA I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD SMUD IS EFFECTUALLY NO IT. HAS DECLARED THAT IT WILL BE THE FIRST. FIRST LARGE UTILITY TO AID TO TRY TO ACHIEVE ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS AND TO HIT IT BY TWENTY THIRTY. THAT THIS THE BODIES THAT SMILE WILL PLAY ITS PART IN ITS ROLE ENSURING THAT OUR STATE GOVERNMENT IN OUR STATE. THE TRI CITY IF ITS CLIMATE GOALS SO S. E. R. FIFTY pSPIRIT COMMITMENT. TO OUR BUYERS POWER SUPPLIERS TO ACHIEVE A ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THAT DOES NOT COMPROMISE RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY AS WELL. SO I HOPE THAT I CAN COUNT ON YOUR VOTE FOR S. YOU'RE FIFTY ONE WHICH RECOGNISES MUD FOR SETTING THE MOST AMBITIOUS GOAL OF ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND BE THE FIRST OF ANY LARGE UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY AND DOING SO ESPECIALLY ASPIRIN I VOTE AND RECOGNIZING THIS VERY IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MATT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. I MUST RISE AND THEN LET THE MEMBERS KNOW I WHEN I CAME TO THE SENATE SEAT I ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A SMART AND I. HAPPEN TO BE A CUSTOMER AS WELL. AND THEY SHOULD THEY GOT WITH ME AND TALKED ABOUT THEIR TWENTY THIRTY PLAN. AND SO THE pREAD THROUGH THE PLAN AND I WANT TO. SHARE WITH YOU I WILL BE OPPOSING THIS. RESOLUTION BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO RAISE. RATES AND- THEY JUST RAISE RATES IN ON JUNE FIFTEENTH THE RATES WENT UP AS A SMART CUSTOMERS. THE COMMODITY COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE FROM ABOUT SIXTYMILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY. MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY. A SEVEN HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE. THAT'S MUCH PLANS TO PAY FOR THIS. WITH COUNTLESS UNKNOWING FUNDING STREAMS. SOME OF THOSE ARE GOVERNMENT POLICIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS GRANTS THAT MEANS THAT SOMEBODY'S TAXPAYER MONEY'S GOING TO GO TO IT. INVESTOR RELATIONSHIPS I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS AS WELL. TECHNOLOGY SAVINGS FOR UNPROVEN THINGS LIKE LARGE BATTERY STORAGE. SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST TO THE RATE PAYERS AND- AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES ON THIS FLOOR THAT THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE ZERO. EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY WAS **** IS GOING TO BE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE RATE PAYERS AND THIS IS A PLAN THAT'S NOT VERY WELL THOUGHT THOUGHT OUT IN MY OPINION SO. THE ONE THING WE CAN WE CAN COUNT ON IS THAT. THE RATE PAYERS WILL BE ON THE HOOK AT THE END. AND WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT BEFORE GOING INTO IT SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I OPPOSE S. C. R. FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY CENTER BECKER. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED MODELS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS SO IMPORTANT. WHAT WE DO ON TRANSPORTATION WHAT WE DO ON THE GRID. BUT WHAT WE DO ON- THE BUILDINGS WILL BE DO YOU ON CEMENT. WE COULDN'T CREATE MODELS FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND IN MANY CASES REST THE WORLD SO I JUST WANNA COMMAND. THE AUTHOR ADMIN COMMANDS BUT THE SURGE THIS MONTH IS A TREMENDOUS. GOAL TO BE ZERO CARBON BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF POLICY FOR A LONG TIME. THE CLEAR MARKET PLACE CONFERENCE WE START FOR EPA NINETEEN NINETY ONE. WE ALWAYS KNEW AT THE TIME THAT THE TECHNOLOGY. WASN'T POSSIBLE AT THAT TIME TO GET. TO ZERO BUT NOW WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. BUT WE HAVE. THE CAPACITY WITH RENEWABLES WITH YOUR THERMAL WITH OFFSHORE WIND. WITH ALL THE OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGY COMING ONLINE WE KNOW WE CAN GET THERE WE KNOW WE CAN ACHIEVE. THIS YOUR CAR BY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND I. HAVE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER GROVE. AND PRESIDENT I TOO HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE DETAILS- WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS. BUT I ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SILICON VALLEY. AND HE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT WE DO OUT THERE MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO SAY THIS BODY IS THAT. MY DISTRICT PRODUCES 53% OF ALL SOLAR ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY TO THE GRID AND SO WHILE MY DISTRICT IS BUILDING LARGE SCALE SOLAR PLANTS WITH NO TAX BENEFITS IS A MATTER OF FACT WE'VE LOST A HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR FIREFIGHTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT- ALL OF THOSE THINGS IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS SO WHAT WE SEND OUR ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY NORTH. POSSIBLY THIS MAN I'M TRYING TO GET A TEXT BACK IMMEDIATELY BUT I KNOW IT DOES GO TO SACRAMENTO WHEN IT DOES GO TO SAN FRANCISCO WHEN IT DOES GO TO LOS ANGELES. AS A MATTER OF FACT LOS ANGELES PUTS THEIR COMMERCIALS UP ON TV AND THEY'RE USING OUR SOLAR. LARGE SCALE SOLAR FACILITIES M. PLANTS- IN KERN COUNTY IN PART OF THEIR- ADVERTISING THIS IS THAT WE'VE GOT THEM ON A GREEN TECHNOLOGY. NOT BELIEVE THAT'S THAT LOS ANGELES IS ON A GREEN TECHNOLOGY A PLATFORM. WELL THAT ENERGY IS COMING FROM KERN COUNTY SO- YOU KNOW WHEN I DON'T SEE SOLAR PLANTS IN INGLEWOOD AND I DON'T SEE SOLAR PLANTS IN SACRAMENTO AND I DON'T SEE LARGE SCALE SOLAR IN ANY OTHER REALLY PARTS OF THE STATE- I JUST YOU KNOW THINK THAT YOU GUYS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS AGAIN OF APPROVING A SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT POWER PLANT. AND I'M ASKING MY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS NOT TO APPROVE THAT PLAN. DON'T APPROVE IT IF WE'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY BENEFITS OUT OF IT WHATSOEVER AND IT'S GONNA DO NOTHING BUT A CHIEF OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS THAT ARE BY THIS GOVERNOR IN THIS. MAJORITY BODY THAT- WE SHOULD HOLD OUT YOU KNOW HOLD TIGHT WE HAVE TAKEN THE HIGH ROAD WE HAVE TAKEN THE HIGH ROAD AND- WE HAVE PRODUCED 53% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND WE GET ZERO CREDIT FOR IT WHATSOEVER AND THEN WE PRODUCE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL AND WE GET ATTACKED ON THAT ON A DAILY BASIS. SO MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA BEACHES RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS BY THE DATE THAT THIS. RESOLUTION IS SET THAT'S MADE HIS AGREED TO. A KERN COUNTY IS A BIG PART OF THAT AND I THINK WE SHOULD TALK. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THAT- THE NEXT SOLAR PLANT IT'S POSSIBLY A HOPEFULLY NOT APPROVED. IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WE HOLD OFF ON IT- IS UP FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF DISNEYLAND IT WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF POWER. GREEN ENERGY. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS PIECE THIS RESOLUTION AND I ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR PAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE SMARTEST MENISCAL UTILITY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE SO I'M PROUD THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE IN SUPPORT. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT- ACTUALLY POWER HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN MANY OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS- BECAUSE I DO HAVE PARTS OF MY DISTRICT AREN'T. COVERED BY SMUD. AND HEAR ABOUT POWER COSTS- THERE AS WELL SO- I THINK CMOS PROVE THEMSELVES RELIABLE HATING THE PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE COST EFFECTIVE- THEY HAVE A GOOD PLAN TO ACHIEVE TWENTY THIRTY ZERO CARB MISSIONS I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT. IN TERMS OF SOLAR IF YOU GO TO SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND YOU KNOW MANY OF YOU FLY OUT OF THAT AIRPORT TO GO HOME. PLEASE NOTE THE SOLAR FARM THAT'S ON THE AIRPORT- SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOLAR HERE BUT CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT ALSO ENGAGED IN SOLAR. AND PROVIDING SOLAR POWER SO WE CAN HAVE A MORE RENEWABLE FUTURE HERE IN THE TIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS ONLY ONE APPRECIATE.
