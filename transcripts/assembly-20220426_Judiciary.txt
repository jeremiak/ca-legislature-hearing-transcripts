UC by virtue of legislation also here representing the California digital equity coalition we are the sponsors of this bill -- that we want to acknowledge the opportunity that was afforded to us the and the analysis are in the work that your staff is done -- we believe that the amendments go in the furtherance off and bring clarity to the issue I don't know if it's at this point in time for me to maybe address some of the concerns from the opposition them in the letter to you all if it is appropriate or if not we can wait till they testify and then I can respond ourselves get directions from the chair it's entirely up to you thank you Mr chairman I'll take the opportunity -- the letter that has been provided in opposition House states that -- they are strongly in support of the goal however cite them they think that -- this is not a position that they can support historically members you should be aware that the digital divide a debate and broadband debate has historically had opposition from this association it did not support the internet for all built in AB sixty sixty five which was the basis that -- allowed for to be able to come forth are they are not supporting the public housing account in the Advanced Services Fund -- they did not support it last year -- this is money that can and should and is necessary to be used in our public housing complexes these are complexes that engage senior housing and other types of government housing including farm worker housing their history shows that they have been on record not supporting the affordable internet -- net equality act and so I want to leave just the message that although the V. let me let me let me rephrase this -- I believe that the cable industry has a place and is a stakeholder however we are facing incredible disproportionate impacts in our local communities be they rural or urban the data is apple whether it's Q. research whether it's research coming from universities the data is very clear that there is a red line anti broadband delivery deployment that we need to deal with it from a public perspective and bill that allows for recourse if and when there is and evidence and it is not uncommon for this legislature in this body to respond it did with the California voting rights act it did with the farmworkers act to protect farmworkers and we are asking that it also be -- with this particular bill be brought forth to protect and enhance reliable affordable high speed internet Ste in the underserved and unconnected communities thank you very much for the opportunity to address you and we ask for your apple thank you -- we do have another witness Chen Colorado with this in person though not with us today right operator will move to the phones is there anyone who would like to indicate support for AB twenty seven fifty three I would like to speak in support of this bill please press one and then zero on your telephone keypad one moment please we do have one coming up what a line number twenty one that's two one your line is open good morning Sir members Kurt Blackburn calling on behalf of the San Diego association of governments vandaag in support amateur there's no one else in the queue at this time I thank you we will now move to opposition I do not have opposition listed is there anyone in the hearing room I'm for yeah we're gonna such over with with Los Angeles unified school district in support warning Mister chair members Bernie Roscoe with a California cable and telecommunications association so -- listen to your testimony Center Polanco I'm gonna have to take some Umbridge with her your comments so the challenge for broadband and the latest California Advanced Services Fund report just came out just last week and so of the thirteen point three million households in California approximately five three hundred fifty thousand households do not have any access whatsoever to broadband so so that's that's a challenge there to build facilities there to the household to have access ninety seven point two percent of California households have access to twenty five in three broadband today but approximately two million households that could sign up for broadband service do not sign up so this is the latest California vents Services Fund report from the public utilities commission these are their numbers not ours no one has done more for broadband deployment and adoption I think in the cable industry and I challenge everyone to that to that comment the ninety seven point two percent broadband deployment in the state is based all on private investment the cable industry until more recently has never really taken a dime from government to do that so to the bill we are very supportive of broadband equity we support private equity we have been doing private equity firm since we have been deploying broadband so the question for the committee though is is this the best approach is the best way to meet that challenge to ensure that those who do not have broadband have not adopted or do not have access to it is this the best way to do it and and I would say not I would say the best thing we need to do and it's in our letter that we share with the committee is to have a partnership with the federal government to have their adoption programs or deployment dollars match up with the plans of the cable industry and the telco industry and that would be a far better reports our approach to the issue of redlining there have been no conclusive studies that show that the cable industry or a telco industry redline so that starting off with that very premise is -- sort of -- upsetting so I would say I would love to see the studies that show that there is redlining there are challenges to broadband deployment -- in some cases in public housing we're not allowed access government owns those buildings -- years ago when they built those buildings they didn't want to support the infrastructure to go into those facilities I thank the senator Bradford then something that Bradford was upset Nickerson gardens in Los Angeles couldn't have broadband access because we couldn't get in there so we support legislation last year by a senator Bradford to help deploy broadband adoption literacy and access to public housing units we did a bill with cinnamon daily to insure that low income households students to get broadband access The Daily bill was vetoed by the governor he thought he's has done enough for K. twelve students and -- Bradford bill was held in the Assembly Appropriations Committee so we are working very hard to to get adoption to get deployments -- hi are only questions for the committee is I think this is this proposal should be more of a policy that's backed up by actions either budgetary earlier legislatively or from the administration you had six billion dollars adopted last year not not a single penny went to an adoption program -- it's permissive it's in there it's -- but it's not explicit it wasn't explicitly adopted and your legislative plan of the six billion dollars to save this much money should go to adoption so anyway -- for all those reasons you just got me got me all worked up center parking so you yeah you got me flustered and that's okay all I will say is that we are supportive of digital equity our only question is we are not supportive of this approach we would -- we would love to work with the S. a Mormon we've had conversations with Assembly woman I'm Center plunk up and we look forward to working with in the future but for now we are approaching the bill in front of you we are oppose thank you thank you anyone else in the hearing room like to speak in opposition of AB twenty seven fifty three seeing none operator would you open the lines for anyone who'd like to indicate opposition to AB twenty seven fifty three and we're not taking testimony but we will take name affiliation and opposition if you do wish to speak in opposition please press one and then zero at this time we DO one late one that's coming up please allow a moment I will go line number thirty line three zero your line is open I thank you Mister chair the Jonathan era bell on behalf of the TI eighty trade association for the wireless industry also in opposition Mister chair there is no one else in kill thank you operator you may close the lines of bring it back to the committee questions comments was Kalra I did get my coffee this morning of the needed amount I'm awake now -- as well as when I think you ought to bring this for you know I I represent City sounds at the capitol so can Valley and yet other far too many of families far too many children that don't have access to internet all that on high speed internet and so I think this problem is pervasive whether you're in a rural community urban community just have to make a very clear statement on that that holds our feet to the fire -- and I think industry -- you know how to be part of the solution I think that we're gonna have to put resources into it there's gonna be a lot of it would have to put policy to back it up but you have to start with making this very clear -- the statement and I think with this of the bill of rights it does that and I think because it puts the responsibility on us in the years ahead -- meant to move to follow through on it and so I I appreciate this bill coming four look for to working with the other on the thank you for the comments all right thank you this Reyes for bringing this forward and for those of us have been working in this space for a long time thank coming providers of fought us tooth and nail every step of the way and they used to cystic six very cleverly but the fact is is that geographically we don't really have appropriate penetration of potentially broadband in every place in California and this sort of archaic notion of twenty five and three is absolutely ridiculous and they hold on to that and because that's a pricing model it is pricing people out of the band with that they actually need on a day to day basis we need to get to symmetrical and we need a lot more capacity because when folks are conducting business or school operations or others they need that capacity given the state of where the electronics are today so I eight this is always interesting when the incoming providers come in and are really trying to block efforts to provide broadband services in a lot of areas I I have a community where we have in common provider for about half of what is effectively a school district had outside of where that provider has decided to invest about half of those kids a lot of the more we see in the images of kids going to Taco Bell to get broadband well nobody's report of these kids because they're not sitting in a public place there's the and or in a visible place like a fast food outlet there sitting outside the school classroom Friday evening Saturdays and Sundays in order to check is the only place that they can get adequate coverage for broadband and the income a providers have blocked every single move every single move to try and have others provide that service out there so they the providers cannot sit there and say we've we're doing everything when in fact they've been for years blocking a lot of these efforts to to truly get broadband where it's needed the most and so I appreciate your efforts here -- it enjoys an aye vote we will certainly take a motion once we get a quorum but I I appreciate your efforts here about -- Majority Leader with that human clones thank you and I think that about the fact that there have been lots of challenges in the past but now there has been billions of dollars invested and now we have no excuse we've to many children and too many without broadband without reliable broadband and they deserve to have it and this bill tells us that this tells them that the state of California is committed to them and with that when we have a quorum I respectfully ask for an aye vote thank you thank you thank you Mr chairman members all right Mr Levine will move to item number two AB nineteen seventeen good morning Mister chair and committee members it's my birthday it's so nice to be with all of you today -- AB nineteen seventeen would ensure that personal information collected through contact tracing cannot be used for law enforcement purposes since the beginning of the code nineteen pandemic there have been over in happen in cases of coca nineteen in California and over eighty eight thousand people have died as a result of the virus one of the strategies used to limit the transmission of cobit nineteen has been the use of contact tracing which identifies individuals who test positive for code and the individuals they may have been in close contact with measures must be taken to protect Californians personal information and build public trust that contact treating information will not be used inappropriate inappropriately by law enforcement agency this is especially important minority and immigrant communities who have been disproportionately impacted by coded Reports of law enforcement officials being used to conduct contact rations only a poor use of public resources it is inappropriate in a road public trust in our efforts to control this in future pandemics the use of contact tracing AB nineteen seventeen will increase public confidence in future contact tracing efforts and ensure that contact tracing data is used only for public health purposes and I have a witness on the phone back at Kramer matter from ACLU thank

contact checking effort it is in line with other recent legislative initiatives The New public health responses from the police to non law enforcement entities not only is contact tracing and I'm an inappropriate function for the police are on and hang on a pleased with public health as necessary to ensure that people cooperate with contact tracing my contact information about who a person up with when and where is collected by police it negatively impact public health goal because people made cherub last of their personal information if it might implicate them in a crime or risk labeling them of Mr he added that it has a king member for example there's also a high degree of distrust for law enforcement and many communities particularly immigrant and those that are most impacted by police violence and over police came and checked we seem to last you can you hear us operator what happened I do does appear that her line disconnected okay when we give her a minute to call back in I

Canadian staff to help us guide us to this point -- and when the of Corum will be grateful for an aye vote thank you the death right this Kalra wanted to present your presenting item number four AB twenty five seventy one on behalf of this power que Han okay well I though I've called Mister Kalra that's thank you Mister chair and members on behalf Assembly member of our can today I present AB twenty five seventy one The bill that protects impressionable children from dangerous firearm advertisements first I'd like to thank the chairman is wonderful Committee staff for their work to address concerns in the bill and on behalf of the author I accept the committees amendments thank you gun violence is at its most devastating when it threatens our children in twenty twenty one there were approximately two hundred and fifty nine unintentional shootings by children resulting in a hundred and four deaths and a hundred and sixty eight injuries weapons used by children of put other children at risk ninety one percent of the victims of the shootings by children were also under eighteen often siblings of the children shooting in California gun violence is the third leading cause of death for children and teens the epidemic of deadly violence is fueled by an industry that encourages children to hold a gun as soon as they can walk gun manufacturers target our kids are slick advertising even children's books the advertising for these weapons as shameless children in California are not allowed to buy or own a gun yet they're advertised across all forms of media cartoons video games and social media up providing first amendment concerns this bill follows similar state laws that place limits on advertising politics that adults may lawfully purchase and use but not minors for example alcohol cannabis and tobacco AB twenty five seventy one will prohibit a person or entity from publishing materials that advertise or market firearms weapons to anyone under the age of eighteen it's quite simple this bill would allow the Attorney General a district or county attorney -- County council to bring a civil action against each violation up to twenty five thousand dollars with me today on the phone is Tonya Chardon attorney with the Brady campaign and sitting next to me is Emily alt from moms demand action thank you Mister car would take the first witness here in the hearing room thank you a good morning my name is Emily all I'm a mom living in Davis and I'm a volunteer leader with the California chapter of moms demand action for gun sense in this role I connect with parents and others all around the state who want to see California lead the way on gun violence prevention I have worked with a positive parenting nonprofit and local public health with the maternal child and adolescent health team in this work I have focused on developing programs to support parents and their kids beginning a pregnancy through early adulthood with the many worries parents already have the last thing they should have to worry about is gun companies trying to market firearms to their kids in addition to my work in public health I am also a former kindergarten teacher and my husband and I have raised three kids as both a teacher and a mom I know the importance of setting clear guardrails for kids including ensuring that all kids know that firearms are not toys the advertising guns to minors by using stuffed animals and cartoon characters complicates parents ability to make that clear distinction two young kids that guns are not toys this important message is undermined when the state allows guns to be advertised in ways designed to appeal to children promoting a guns everywhere culture that tragically results in some kids getting access to guns and harming themselves or others AB twenty five seventy one would prohibit advertising firearms in materials directed to children and prohibit publication of fire arms advertisements or marketing materials that are attractive to minors our state laws already had knowledge two truths one firearms are especially dangerous in the hands of minors and to we have a responsibility to regulate the marketing of dangerous products to minors AB twenty five seventy one built a bridge between those concepts and closes the gap in our state law by regulating the marketing of firearms to children we should not allow for profit companies to inundate our kids with ads suggesting that deadly weapons are desirable toy we urge your yes vote on AB twenty five seventy one thank you thank you A. N. do we have Tanya sharp with us on the telephone S. good morning everybody and thank you so much for having me on time you start I'm Peter council director of state and federal policy at Brady I appreciate you allowing me to testify today in support of eighteen anti AB two five seven one Israeli clearly and exclusively targeting commercial speech and the further in advance -- interests of the state of California preventing gun violence -- yeah Bonta a public health epidemic research recent research shows that a twenty twenty gun violence was the leading cause of death for children -- and teams in the country which is to support a research and evidence also shows that farms are especially dangerous in the hands of minors or into this bill is that it it further through the same reason we do not allow children to purchase guns and only pet that's them in limited circumstances we know that children should not have access to guns and that what they do they are at high risk -- this bill is limited to commercial speech from gun industry members and concerned commercial speech directed at those who are not lawful purchasers of firearms namely miners it did not impact commercial street speech directed at legal gun purchasers for all of these reasons -- and in the interest of saving lives we urge an aye vote on AB two five seven one thank you right is there anyone him in the hearing room who would like to indicate support for a bi twenty five seventy one and we will be not taking further testimony but name affiliation and support for the bill hi my main my name is Mary Diplock I live in Sacramento I live in Sacramento and violence I am also saying that here we're just taking name of Philly okay I am a volunteer -- just my name okay and in support thank you thanks hi my name is anatomic and I live in west Sacramento and I'm with a volunteer with moms demand action for gun sense and I'm in support of AB two five seven one thank you anyone else seeing none operator you can would you open alliance please for any support for AB twenty five seventy one can will take name affiliation and support and support please press one then zero at this time we'll go to line number forty two that's four two your line is open good morning turn members cooking on and on behalf of every town for gun safety and support thank you and we'll we'll go to line number forty that's four zero your line is open hello my name is Kirti vente of the rainy public policy group I'm calling on behalf of the city of Mountain View in support of AB twenty five seventy one thank you Mister chair there's no one else in queue at this time I thank you we will now move to opposition I have to opposition witnesses listed Dan read of the national rifle association and Eugene Volokh all who is an individual are either of those on the line pediatric care Dan read here go ahead yes -- Eugene Volokh we'll start with the and read yes that Mr Care members the committee for the record and request regional director of the national rifle association we're here in strong opposition AB twenty five seventy one the U. S. Supreme Court made it clear that commercial speech does not fall outside the purview of the first amendment and tobacco case -- and they applied the central Hudson with commercial speech that outlined so as long as that lawful activity the government must the circumstantial State interested purportedly advanced bites regulation on speech the regulation must directly advances certain interest in the regulation of being there but the nearest means of which the to serve the state interest we feel like this bill just failed to meet that standard -- that you can see this legislation detracted to minors and I'll be brief because I I think the professor has is going to provide some really good insight when it comes to the first amendment in this bill but it's still failed to account that minors can't lawfully possess firearms into for many lawful activities such as hunting or competition shooting X. better up -- and also that miners may find -- the advertising with the tractor for the same reason why adults and we just feel like this is going to completely fail on personal grounds we feel like this could really target as hunter Education in R. three efforts by the state -- as well as -- -- complicate you'd shooting team six cetera -- and I'll yield the rest of my time over to the professor -- but weren't strong opposition thank you thank you N. we do not allow time yielded but I will call on you Jean Volek go ahead please yes yes thank you very much -- I'm Eugene Volokh a professor of law at UCLA school of law where I specialize mostly in free speech law I'm testifying solely on my own behalf I'm not being compensated for this testimony by anyway I think even the bill as proposed to be amended would violate the first amendment for three reasons what is it would cover fully protected political speech and not just commercial advertising of a gun magazine publisher for instance our gun advocacy group that publishes a magazine would likely be covered as a quote firearm industry member close quote under the definition because it was formed to advocate for use or ownership of guns generally might endorse specific products and product reviews which of course are common in magazines and Lyft Kerry advertising for cuts that publisher advocacy group within be forbidden from for instance using cartoon characters even if it's in its fully protected political advertising it's a buys but by is that a radio ad war right urging gun ownership generally and not any product in particular but to even as to commercial advertising the law was unconstitutionally vague it covers any ads that are accorded tractive to minors close quote even if they're equally attracted to legal adult buyers often the same answer attracted to both in the specific examples don't resolve the vagueness problem because they're listed only as examples prefix to the phrase quote including but not limited to two close quote of three the law also covers constitutionally protected commercial advertising such as the use of caricatures of miners are cartoon characters in ads that are clearly targeted at adults -- -- lawfully buy guns so that their children could use those guns from illegal hunting or target shooting indeed California law expressly allows parents to have their children use guns this way under parental supervision and parents may well wish to buy guns -- for their children to use for these purposes that advertising the local buyers the parents and not the children directly thank you for letting me testifying please let me know if you have any questions thank you all right we'll go to others who would like to indicate opposition to AB twenty five seventy two is there anyone in the hearing room I'd say none operator would you open the lines for anyone who would like to indicate opposition to AB twenty five seventy one at this time we are not take further testimony but just name affiliation and opposition like to speak in opposition please press one then zero at this time we have one queuing up one moment please what okay line number twenty that's two zero your line is open trade association for America's gun manufacturers -- we are in strong opposition of this bill thank you thank you there's no one else in opposition at this time I think you are pretty may close the lines on a bring it back to the committee questions comments the stress I want to thank the committee currently for such a great -- analysis especially in going through the four pronged as -- the test that the the the courts have have used to determine whether something like this is constitutional and I so wanted to appreciate the Committee and thank the author wherever she may be thank you other comments questions of Mister Kalra on a new you're here on behalf of Mr K. hand that I want to thank you for this bill opposition testimony not withstanding I think the analysis makes pretty clear that this is a very appropriate for the state of California to do that with that you may close up thank you Mister chair I on behalf of the centre about can respect we ascribe thank you and we will take this up when we get that elusive quorum thank you all right I am number three AB twenty one eighty eight Mister Cork hi good morning thank you chair and members even though California has legalized both medicinal and recreational cannabis use employees can still be discriminated against in the workplace for the consumption of this legal substance during their downtime so we all agree no one should ever show up to work hiring paired but most employers conducted drug tests they typically screen for the presence of non psychoactive cannabis metabolites well you get this from the urine test this test can be positive if you consume cannabis it anytime in the last month the positive metabolic test has no correlation to workplace safety or productivity testing for metabolite and penalizing employees for engaging in illegal activity on their downtime are absolute practices in the state of California THC is the compound in cannabis they can do psychoactive effects metabolites are what remain present in an individual's body's bodily fluids weeks after cannabis use and after the THC has been metabolized arm in the test of saliva you can directly to test actually detect the THC AB twenty one eighty eight would address these obsolete practices by making unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person if they've consumed cannabis off the job or if they have non psychoactive cannabis metabolites in their urine hair or bodily fluids G. analysis states AB twenty one eighty eight does not protect prohibit pre employment testing does not prevent employers from maintaining a drug free workplace this bill is a ballot solution that protects the right of employees and employers and in fact a saliva test is a much better way to guarantee a drug free workplace then these other tasks which typically are done S. pre employment screening and then never used gap I'm here to testify in support is Gail Garinger from California normal thank you first witness please are yes thank you thank you are Mr chairman members of the committee and Dr clerk are you are California normally is proud to sponsor AB twenty one eighty eight all this talk to quick noted cannabis is legal in California and workers are supposed to have a right to engage in illegal activity while they are off the job yet countless workers get discriminated against on these are metabolite tests The don't detect actual impairment but rather past use of cannabis days or weeks previously in effect urine tests are like looking through workers trash and firing them empty beer or liquor bottles are fair -- show this bill fixes this problem by banning employment metabolite tests except where federal law requires otherwise this is consistent by the way with the ruling of the California personnel board which found that a urine test does not establish that an employee is under the influence of marijuana and therefore does not justify discipline that was gonna Transportation case are again emphasizing that this bill in no way compromises employers ability to assure a safe and drug free workplace because it allows protested actually detect employment impairment these include computer tablet performance test which can detect impairment of any kind and also our saliva or oral fluid tests which detect marijuana's active ingredient THC for the hours during which users are actually under the influence let me set world fluid tests are more accurate all Lassen invasive and less costly than urine tests and have been federally approved for workplace use by Sam's are there is no science to show of the hearing test protect our jobs safety there's not a single FTA study has ever been done finding that urine testing is either safe or effective at providing workplace accidents and numerous studies have found otherwise that workers who test positive for metabolites have no higher risk of accidents even him are safety sensitive jobs are let me conclude by saying urine test are very high obnoxious invasion of workers personal bottle the privacy I mean we talk about mask mandates Bob we're talking about your in here I'm too frequently the tests were misused to discriminate against unpopular workers and minorities over twenty other states have laws protecting employment rights of legal cannabis it's time for California to follow suit we urge your support to the bill thank you all right is there anyone else in the hearing room who'd like to indicate support for AB twenty one eighty eight all right seeing none operator would you open the lines for anyone who would like to indicate support for a bi twenty one eighty eight I would like to indicate support please press one zero at this time we will first go to line number forty three that's four three your line is open good morning Mr chairman members general dentist on behalf of Peter W. S. B. look okay nine thirty in support of AB twenty one eighty eight thank you now with a line number forty five that's four five your line is open hi hi good morning my bill and I get I am up from a

configsafe accents in strong support of the bill Mister chair there's no one else into it this time all right thank you we will now move to opposition I do have one opposition witness listed Robert Mutrie from the California chamber of commerce come for please good morning Mr chairman members road which you for the California chamber of commerce -- morning -- we are opposed AB two one eight eight as a job killer at this point I want to be clear we are in a talk to the office office we met yesterday and really appreciate on the discussion and we hope that -- we shared and draft a man's we hope we can resolve a lot of her concerns here but presently remain opposed to chop killer our paramount concern with this bill is the workplace safety we are not opposed to saliva testing or marijuana use outside the workplace however we are very concerned with keeping such impairment out of the workplace -- I want to focus on one particular point because it seems like some confusion about this and and a difference of opinion of ours and I want to make clear reasoning -- we do believe the Texas bill actually does pre prohibit pre employment drug testing and I want to direct to the exact language of the bill receive this which is proposed section -- one two nine four five for a one basically a says is unlawful discrimination is the person in any hiring conditions if based on the following a one the person's use of cannabis off the job away from the workplace my concern is that pre employment testing always relates to space outside of the workplace that's the nature of pre employment testing so that's the specific language we base our concern on I think that we have a different temptation from the author were hoping to address that brief -- concerns with the bill the remain obviously we have some concerns of placement fee how we're trying to look at places where that works and how to work on the mechanically we spoken to the author's office about it and we are also looking at draft amendments to the federal protection language to deal with federal state conflicts again I want to highlight that we really appreciate the on going engagement the author but at this point we remain strongly opposed AB two one eight eight as a job killer thank you for thank you anyone else in the hearing room like to indicate opposition to AB twenty one eighty eighth good

S. we moved our item number seven AB seventeen forty two that morning Mister chair and members still there's an opportunity to present so I ran over here whenever Committee it's I'm here this morning to presents Assembly Bill one seven four two -- it's legislation that seeks to strengthen and clarify the existing tobacco directory statute to meet California's obligations under the master settlement agreement otherwise known as the MSA substantial annual payments from tobacco manufacturers to our state these payments are provided and -- in perpetuity and have exceeded a hundred million in recent years however these payments are condition on California's enactment and the diligent enforcement of an escrow statute poses a since the some similar -- so financial obligations on tobacco companies that are not a party to the MSA and to prevent the state from a losing out on any payments this bill strengthens existing law to aid the Attorney General's enforcement of the X. escrow statute and other -- MSA obligations by targeting non compliant bad actors meanwhile the fire safety act it -- the prohibits cigarettes from being sold in California unless they meet fire safety standards under current law the state fire marshal review cigarettes to verify fire safety however due to certain restraints many cigarettes have been automatically approved which happens when the fire marshal takes no action on cigarette applications after ten days so this legislation will help reduce the risk of non fire safe cigarettes from entry the market by transferred enforcement of the fire safety act to the California attorney general's office which already enforces other parts of the fire safety act and extends the fire safety review period from ten days to thirty days to provide the Attorney General adequate time to review and verify -- fire safety compliance with me here to testify I believe remotely are Jenna Stanford and James Hart on behalf of Attorney General Rob Bonta and with that thank you Mister chair thank you Mr even so I do have those two witnesses listed James Hart and Janice standerford are you with us on the telephone we are yes Sir go ahead please thank you the morning after chairing committee members my name is Janet Stanford and the deputy Attorney General and legislative advocate in the attorney general's office we have Attorney General Rob Bonta I want to thank assemblymember respect for his leadership on this issue offering to sell seventeen forty two is an important felt that would ensure California continue to meet its obligations under the tobacco master settlement agreement intelligently enforcement taken back a lot of determination the California has not modified are important obligations could with a lock and a significant portion of the annual but on the payment that California received such as a family member me to mention have recently exceeded eight hundred million dollars per year but they represent does not remain the same over time AB seventeen forty two what at that California's tobacco directory statute to address recent developments and I think that industry and eighty Attorney General and are correct and accurate it's a good government measures that protect California's interest in public health and put into a level playing field for compliant manufacture it also improves efficiency by consolidating administration and enforcement of the fact that the grant program but the Attorney General I think the graphics English when they're not being actively closed while non fire safe cigarettes do not go out on the ground and that present a fire risk HM need on all topics already previously doublenest buyers take their vacation finally the preventive by manufactured each year forty two reduces costs by consolidating reveal a fire three thirty cases down from two agencies to one twenty twenty the bill before you packed in the Assembly but stopped forward progress you to cover the latest time constraints here we hope to get the bill to the finish line to ensure the California continue to repeat the potential annual payments under the master plan immigrant joining me today on the phone and

Friedman I that bill it needs to more votes so I will put that built on call all right thank you Mr Santiago item number six AB twenty nine ten Jeff and the many steps that were in current day thank you AB two hundred twenty nine ten would fight against air pollution air quality violations Max -- liability for negligent penalties for air quality polluters -- like some of those currently we have about five -- a frequent polluters -- we feel that increase the fines by threefold -- would help polluting because right now it's just the cost of doing business about five thousand dollars it's incurred and they continue to violate -- the air quality pollution rules that are currently in place -- this bill would affect -- other industries as well -- which you have stated in your analysis a respectfully and ask for an aye vote thank you first witness please good morning chair members of the committee my name is Terrence Mann I'm the deputy executive officer for compliance and enforcement at south because taken deep we are pleased to sponsor AB twenty nine ten it seeks to provide more meaningful deterrence against air quality violations especially in disadvantaged communities by raising limits on civil penalties under existing law a company or facility that violates air quality rules regulations or permit conditions is strictly liable for a civil penalty of no more than ten thousand dollars per day this is by far the most common level of civil penalty that we use in enforcement actions but if the violator establishes an affirmative defense that the act was not intentional or negligent that the strict liability penalty cap goes down to five thousand dollars while those amounts may be significant to small mom and pop type businesses the current penalties for air quality violations have very little deterrent value to big companies and other well funded violators the ten thousand dollar maximize often just a slap on the wrist and consider the cost of doing business it also doesn't matter how expensive the air quality violation is for example there are rendering facilities in Los Angeles that process raw animal materials and admit terrible odors which in which can impact of thousands of people no how no matter how far its geographic reach and how many people are affected the recovery for this kind of over event will still be capped at ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars per day per violation due to these low penalty amounts we see repeated violations from the same facilities despite our enforcement actions the family limits applied all kinds of facilities where we see regular non compliance including oil and gas drilling operations landfills and power plants to name a few and many of these facilities are located in or near our most vulnerable communities importantly this bill should not impact small family run businesses the health and safety code already lists several mitigating factors that must be considered when determining civil penalties for air quality violations this ensures the penalties are fair and match violator's ability to pay we respectfully request your support for this important bill that will help deter air quality violations and in turn reduce emissions to protect the communities we all serve thank you thank you all right is there anyone in the hearing room who it's like to speak in support of AB twenty nine ten Allen ABS with the bay area air quality management district in support thank you anyone else seeing none operator would you open the lines for anyone who'd like to indicate support for AB twenty nine ten would like to advocate support please press one then zero at this time Mister chair no one is coming up at this time I thank you we will then move to opposition

opposition to AB twenty nine ten but to speak in opposition please press one then zero at this time sure there is going to bring up at this time all right thank you -- close lines are pretty may close lines of bring it back to the committee for questions or comments seeing none Mr Santiago you may close thank you Mister chair we respectfully often about thank you I'll take a motion thank you thirty seconds and the second thank you that motion is due passed to appropriate call the roll please Stone aye Stone aye Cunningham Davies Davies I Kalra Kalra aye Kiley highly no Maienschein Reyes Rivas bloom M. I. Friedman sneaks to that bill needs to more votes will put off call the Mister thank you this Wicks all right I'm number one AB eighteen ninety seven thank you Mister chair and that I will know this is our last bill so we could get members back to the committee so we can wrap up our business with this bill and immediately there after it would be appreciated go ahead please good morning Kern members getting from the swing space here's like one of those dreams were you can't walk in you're trying to move from point a to point B. okay this is a tough I want to thank the committee and the committee staffs that work on this bill and I accept the committees amendments thank you and the Bay Area overall compliance with air quality requirements have declined in recent years with increase flooding events that have made communities less safe in of caused air quality to significantly decline this a Klein are in compliance with air quality regulations has negative Daly impacted communities communities in my district as they expose people to toxic air contaminants lead to shelter in place certifications and increase public health risks at my district there have been increases in air pollution complaints and the increasing flare events that refiners have led to incidents that have negatively impacted the health at the communities and have even impacted school closures in the surrounding areas specifically in twenty twenty one the Bay Area quality management district issued over two hundred and forty notices of violations to Bay Area refineries to dress the overall decline in compliance with air quality regulations AB eighteen ninety seven will increase the civil penalty sealing for violations of state or local air quality rules to thirty thousand dollars if the Vice violation results in a disruption to the community the civil penalty will also be raised up to one hundred thousand dollars for subsequent violations for each violation within a twelve month period refineries are one of the largest sources of pollutants and there's not much incentive with the current penalty structure to prevent violations of air quality regulation therefore eighteen AB eighteen ninety seven will increase the penalties for violations of air quality regulations so that these penalties can become more of a deterrent for any future violations I want to thank the bill's sponsors the bay area air quality management district and with me here to testify I believe -- Allen ABS is with a very cool air quality manager district it will be testing in person and then Christopher Chavez the coalition for clean air will be testifying over the phone and with that I would respectfully ask for an aye vote thank you I do have those two witnesses listed first witness here in the hearing room please good morning Mr chairman members of the committee I'm Allen ABS representing the bay area air quality management district and sponsor of AB eighteen ninety seven thank you for considering this bill and I'd also like to acknowledge Committee staffer there well written analysis people that live in refinery communities experience some of the highest cumulative health burdens in California even in circumstances where the refineries are operating within all their permit conditions unfortunately refineries don't always operate within their permit conditions and in twenty twenty one alone the air district issued over two hundred forty notices of violation refinery community residents also experienced at least thirty flaring events in twenty twenty one this is actually a decrease in flaring come the twenty nineteen when refinery communities experienced seventy two flaring events that's a flaring event every five days where you might be told to stay inside your child might not be able to go to school or you might have to seek medical care because of excess emissions of sulfur oxides particulate matter and toxic air contaminants the penalty sealing for these events was ten thousand dollars in the year two thousand and is risen only nine percent in the last twenty two years imagine being a refinery community resident and knowing that this type of disruption in your community is only worth slightly over a ten thousand dollar fine and the companies making record profits I'd like to thank Assembly member wicks for her leadership in authoring AB eighteen ninety seven which takes a small step towards better aligning penalties for refineries violating air quality permits causing community disruptions and endangering public health AB eighteen ninety seven proposes a modest increase to thirty thousand dollars for certain penalties at refineries and a further increase for repetitive violations the burden refinery communities while these modest amounts can't fully mitigate the impacts in these communities we hope it discourages thinking about these events as a minor cost of doing business thank you for considering this bill I'm here to answer any questions and I respectfully ask for your I. boats thank you we also have Christopher Chávez with us on the telephone are you with us yes I am mature the head please good morning yes good morning Committee members -- my name is Chris Chavez nine be deputy policy director coalition for clean air I'm also resident of western Long Beach in a member of the women's in Carson in west Long Beach SB six seventeen community steering committee coalition for clean air support eighteen A. B. H. ninety seven communities near petroleum refineries including my own are at high risk for exposure to toxic releases at the most extreme in a toxic release of a chemical like modified hydrochloric acid in danger hundreds of thousands of the hundreds of thousands of lives more commonly experience however if exposure to toxic releases that while not immediately fatal still harm human health according to the south coast air quality management district's multiple air toxic exposure study the codes for commute the commute to Wilmington Carson and watch Long Beach have a relative air toxic cancer risk eighty eight to ninety nine percent higher than the rest of the south coast air basin it should be no surprise then why the residents of my community let's Long Beach have an average I have on average a sixty eight year shorter lifespan than their counterparts in east Long Beach unfortunately topic provider could talk to be leases from refineries are treated no different than any other toxic release such small penalty pet no practical deterrence considering that the oil industry is among the most profitable industries in the world AB eighty to ninety seven would address this by creating a new civil penalty of up to thirty thousand dollars for toxic release at refinery the results in a severe disruption to the community and exposure twenty five people or more further this bill would also create a new hundred thousand dollars civil penalty for subsequent toxic release at refinery if it's a recurrence within the next twelve months though the the bill these amounts are still relatively low they are an improvement over the currently operates penalties for these reasons we ask for your support for eighteen eighteen ninety seven thank you all right is there anyone in the hearing room who would like to indicate support for a bi eighteen ninety seven full of crap on the health of the at the half of the south coast a candy in support thank you anyone else in the hearing room seeing none operator would you open the lines for anyone who would like to indicate support for a bi eighteen ninety seven but to indicate support please press one then zero at this time thank you have a few in Q. here one moment in this well I number fifty eight that's five eight your line is open good morning Chen members Madeline Cooper from Yeltsin Marc on behalf of Contra Costa county in court thank you hello I number fifty seven that's five seven your line is open thank you Jan worn representing the interfaith climate action network of Contra Costa county and we rise in strong support for a bi eighteen ninety seven thank you well I number twenty six that's two six your line is open thank young lady from Pasadena California in support of AB eighteen ninety seven sure there's no one else into it this time I thank you we will then move to opposition I do not have any opposition listed is there anyone here in the hearing room would like to speak in opposition to AB eighteen ninety seven thank you Mr chairman members the legacy of the western states petroleum association representing the state's refiners -- in opposition respectfully The bill arbitrarily -- increases penalties to the -- defined amount which we see as arbitrary that's unclear criteria for what a community the disruption to community is does not define it hearing testimony we've heard a number of potential -- options for shelter in place to serious exposure to toxics The bill itself does not define what a disruption to community is making it arbitrary and and broad and finally the bill singles out a single industry and I will note that it's in direct contrast to the bill you just heard or it increases penalties across board equal violations should require eagle penalties this bill sets a precedent by single singling out a single industry and for those reasons we oppose and thank you anyone else here in the hearing room opposition to AB eighteen ninety seven I see none operator you may open the lines for any body who would like to indicate opposition to AB eighteen ninety seven I would like to using your posts this bill please press one then zero at this time sure there is no one queuing up at this time all right thank you are pretty may close the lines I will bring it back to the committee questions comments Mister Kalra for bring this forward when climb managed to strip his by eight years ago so we are making efforts back then to try to increase at the back of my bad thousand dollars right now when I recall and so even back then -- legislation was stymied at the time and so unfortunate we're still making those efforts but we have to keep trying because the other reality is even at ten dollars per violation it just consumes orders absorbs the cost of doing business hopefully with more appropriate -- of fines we can actually have some incentives of equipment upgrades and and investment in safety have you in infrastructure other be more of a sense to do that rather than rely on fines especially if there are I still think I mean even these fines are in a move -- -- are of but I guess the the most you could possibly do so I get the help of my but hopefully it's enough to actually create some more long standing improvements to some of the facilities in terms of safety so thank you and how to make a motion thank you there is a motion and a second thank you other questions comments signaled this week to make clothes would respect faster and I thought thank you we do have a motion a second that motion is to pass as amended to
