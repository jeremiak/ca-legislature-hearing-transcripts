TALK ABOUT THE A A NUMBER OF THOSE ITEMS WE BEGIN TODAY WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CALTRANS AND THE WE'VE GOT THREE ISSUES. TO DISCUSS. WE'LL BE TAKING NO ACTIONS TODAY. TAKING NOTE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE NO COLLEAGUES HERE JUST POINT. BUT WE HAVE NO ACTIONS PLAN TODAY SO. WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND FOR ALL I KNOW WILL AND IS A SUBCOMMITTEE. ON BUT THE GOOD MORNING WELCOME AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING I'M LAURIE BERMAN DIRECTOR CALTRANS EVERY YEAR CALTRANS PRESENTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ARE CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT FINANCE LETTER. WHICH ADDRESSES ARE PROJECT DELIVERY RESOURCE NEEDS. FOR THE FOR THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR IN MAY WE COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH ZERO BASED STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS TO SUPPORT OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. IT'S WORTH NOTING THEN EACH OF THE LAST TEN YEARS YOU JUST PULL THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO HIM. IT'S ON RIGHT. AS FAR AS I KNOW. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN EACH OF THE LAST TEN YEARS SINCE THE PEAK OF DELIVERY FOR PROP ONE BE CALTRANS HAS REQUESTED A DECREASE IN STAFFING. FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT WE HAVE OVER THOSE TEN YEARS DECREASE THE SIZE OF OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT STAFF BY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT PROCESS POSITIONS OR ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. PASSAGE OF THE LANDMARK SENATE BILL ONE LEGISLATION PROVIDES A TREMENDOUS BOOST TO TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT OUR OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. I REQUEST BEFORE YOU TODAY OF EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS WILL PROVIDE THE STAFFING AND RESOURCES NECESSARY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF SENATE BILL ONE. CALTRANS WILL DELIVER AN HISTORIC LEVEL OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE TRAVELING PUBLIC AND TACKLE A HUGE BACKLOG OF REHABILITATION AND PRESERVATION PROJECTS. THAT HAVE RISEN AS A RESULT OF DECADES OF UNDERFUNDING. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MY KEEPER THE CALTRANS PROJECT DELIVERY PROGRAM MANAGER WHO WILL PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF OUR REQUEST. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BERMAN AND HER GOOD MORNING CENTER. WAS MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR BERMAN T. CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT PROGRAM IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE. BY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS. AND TWO HUNDRED AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. THIS IS TO SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF THIRTY TWO HUNDRED ACTIVE PROJECTS WITH OVER FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR OUR THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POSITIONS A PERSON HOW YEARS FOR STATE STAFF. FORTY FOUR PERSONAL YOUR EQUIVALENTS. OF CASH OVER TIME FOR STATE STAFF. AND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING OR ANY CONSULTANT. THE FDA'S. THIS REQUEST CONSIDERS OUR BUDGET YEAR NEEDS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A FIVE YEAR WORKLOAD PROJECTION. THAT IS INCREASING TO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM S. B. ONE. RIGHT NOW CALTRANS HAS COMPLETED THIRTEEN SP ONE PROJECTS. WE HAVE SIXTY FOUR PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION CURRENTLY. AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED BEGINNING THE DESIGN AND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE PROCESS NOW. THE CDC IS MEETING TOMORROW. AND WILL ADOPT AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SAFETY CONGESTION IN FOR IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM UP PROJECTS. FOR STATE AND LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TRADITIONALLY THE COS PROGRAM COMES TO YOU REQUESTING. THE BUDGET AT A NINETY TEN RATIO. NINETY PERCENT FOR OUR STATE STAFF AND TEN PERCENT. SINCE. IN DEVELOPING THIS REQUEST FOR RESOURCES WE LOOKED AT HOW QUICKLY WE COULD HIRE. DROUGHT THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR HOW MUCH OVERTIME WE COULD FEASIBLY YEARS. AND HOW WE COULD USE ANY CONSULTANT RESOURCES TO FILL THE GAPS IN ADDRESSING OUR WORKLOAD NEEDS FOR THIS NEXT YEAR. TO ACHIEVE A NINETY TEN RATIO. FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR WE NEED TO HIRE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ADDITIONAL STAFF. BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT BY JULY FIRST. OUR PLAN IS TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO HIRE AGGRESSIVELY BY BRINGING ON BOARD AS MANY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. TO GET TO OUR GOAL OF ACHIEVING THE TRADITIONAL NINETY PERCENT STATE STAFF. TEN PERCENT ANY CONSULTANT STAFF RATIO. THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT FOR US TO PROVIDE. THE LEGISLATURE MONTHLY UPDATES ABOUT OUR PROGRESS. IN MAKING OUR HIRING GOALS. IF WE HIRE ABOUT A HUNDRED PER MONTH. AND WE CONSIDER ATTRITION. WE WILL HAVE A NET INCREASE OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THIS NEXT YEAR. AND WILL REACH OUR GOAL. OF EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE STATE STAFF. WHICH WOULD ACHIEVE THE NINETY TEN RATIO. BEFORE ABLE TO HIRE MORE SOONER WE WILL. WERE NOT LOCKED IN BY THE REQUEST OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE STATE POSITIONS. FOUR OF THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. GIVES US THE FLEXIBILITY WE NEED AND WILL ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO ADJUST THE MAX. OF PERSONAL SERVICES AND CONSULTANTS FIT OUR WORKLOAD NEEDS AND THE ABILITY TO HIRE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IF OUR PROPOSAL ON THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGES APPROVED IN FACT THE PERSONAL SERVICES BUDGET FOR THE OVERTIME AND THE REGULAR TIME STATE STAFF. MAY ACTUALLY BE UTILIZED ABOVE THESE BUDGETED LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY. LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME THERE ARE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT OUR. LEVEL OF VACANCIES AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND OUR ABILITY TO HIGH. AS WE TRANSITIONED FROM ARE PROGRAM THAT WHAT IS WAS DECLINING IN THE COS PROGRAM TO NOW PERIOD OF GROWTH. WE'VE HAD AN INCREASED FOCUS ON HIRING TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS. WE ADAPTED RAMPED UP OUR HIRING PRACTICES OVER THE. COURSE THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR. AND WE EXPECT THE HIGHER OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY WE'RE TO CALTRANS EMPLOYEES THIS YEAR. AS OF APRIL. WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VACANCIES. BUT TWO HUNDRED CONDITIONAL JOB OFFERS THAT WERE OUT THERE. TO ACHIEVE THIS. EXCESSIVE ARE HIGHER WE PARTICIPATED IN UNIVERSITY CAREER FAIRS. WE'VE MADE FOCUSED EFFORTS FOR HARD TO. HIGHER UP HARD TO RECRUIT CLASSIFICATIONS USING LINK THEN IN TRADE MAGAZINES. WE HELD CAREER FAILURE FAIRS AT MULTIPLE CALTRANS FACILITIES. WE'VE PERFORMED BASS HIRING EFFORTS ADS GOING OUT FOR THIRTY FORTY PEOPLE AT. FOR. OUR JOB ANNOUNCEMENTS. WE'VE TARGETED NATIONWIDE OUTREACH TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND WHAT WILL BE WORKING WITH CALLIE CHAR IN PARTNERSHIP TO PILOT THE CREW AMBASSADOR CAP PROGRAM. TO MEET MOM MORE STRATEGIC OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. MOST RECENTLY WE'D GONE TAKING OUR CALTRANS HER HIRING CENTERS ON THE ROAD. SO THIS IS A FULL SERVICE APPROACH WHERE WE DO BOTH RECRUITING AND HIRING BY MOVING ARE HIRING PANELS. AND OUR HR STAFF TO ARE PERFECT. TEN CHIU FUTURE EMPLOYEES ARE. LAST WEEK WE WENT FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY. WITH OUR MOBILE HIRING CENTER. AND WE HELD INTERVIEWS FOR A DAY AND A HALF. THIS RESULTED IN FIFTY JOB OFFERS. MADE TALKED MADE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES THIS IS OUR FIRST TIRING CENTER. WE HAVE TWO UPCOMING HIRING CENTERS NEXT WEEK WILL BE AT SACRAMENTO STATE TO DO THE SAME THING. AND IN EARLY JUNE AT CAL POLY POMONA. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR HIRING OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO BRING PEOPLE ON BOARD. CANDIDATES ARE NOT LIMITED TO JUST THOSE UNIVERSITIES WERE USING THESE AS HIRING HUBS SO WERE ALSO RECRUITING OUT TO THE NEARBY UNIVERSITIES. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE HOLDING THESE HIRING CENTERS. IN HIRING IN THIS WAY WE'RE GOING TO WEAR THE CANDIDATES ARE AS OPPOSE ASKING THEM TO COME TO US AND I THINK WOULD BE SEEN BY THE SUCCESS THIS PAST WEEK THAT A SUCCESSFUL. MOVE TO TRY TO DO THAT. WITH OUR MORE AGGRESSIVE HARM APPROACH WE EXPECT TO END THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR WITH NO VACANCIES. AND FACT BUT GOING BEYOND THAT AND GETTING A HEAD START ON A HIRING FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR CALTRANS. REMAINS FOR THIS COS PROGRAM TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND DELIVER ARE PROJECTS. WALT THE SAME TIME ACHIEVING THE NINETY PERCENT STATE STAFF TEN PERCENT CONSULTANT FTA MAKEUP BY THE END OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OR EARLIER. IN ADDITION THIS REQUEST INCLUDES NON COS PROGRAM OPERATING EXPENSES A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION. FOR CALTRANS ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM TO. PAY THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL REESE HOT SIDE GENERAL SERVICES. TO EVALUATE CALTRANS FACILITY-NEEDS IN LIGHT OF THE NEED TO HIRE MORE STAFF TO DELIVER MORE PROJECTS. AND ONE TIME TO MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR THE LEGAL PROGRAM FOR OUR INCREASED. DESTRUCTION ARBITRATION EXPENSES. SO IN CONCLUSION WE FEEL THIS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND THE RIGHT MIX OF RESOURCES TO DELIVER NEXT YEAR'S PROJECTS. CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO AGGRESSIVELY HIGHER WHILE FILLING THE GAPS UNTIL WE CAN BRING ON BOARD THIS EIGHT HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES. TO RECHARGE GOAL EVERY THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE STATE STAFF. WHICH AGAIN WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRADITIONAL NINETY TEN SPLIT BETWEEN STATES STEPHANIE ANY CONSULTANT RESOURCE. CALTRANS WE HAVE A STRONG PROJECT DELIVERY RECORD. DELIVERING NEARLY NINETY NINE PERCENT OF OUR PROJECTS. TWO CONSTRUCTION SINCE THE FIVE SIX FISCAL YEAR. AND WITH THESE RESOURCES WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT. STRONG. RECORD OF UP PROJECT DELIVERY. THAT CONCLUDES OPENING STATEMENT. THANK YOU AN WITH RICK SPECTRE THE A TRADITIONAL NINETY TEN SPLIT IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY. YOU WERE. INTENTION IS TO ACHIEVE THAT SPLIT BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE. A. A PERIOD OF TIME WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE. THE NINETY PERCENT TO OF A FACTOR. HOW AND AND THAT'S UNTIL SOMETIME IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN? YES SO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT IMMEDIATELY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO BRING A HUNDRED NEW STAFF ON BY JULY FIRST. WE'LL DO IT AS QUICKLY AS BE KEPT THE CAMP AND SOMETIME NEXT YEAR THANK YOU AND WHAT IS THAT DUE TO THE SPLIT HOW. FAR OFF OF THE. NINETY TEN. DO ENVISIONED IT TAKING. OR. THE BUDGET REQUEST IS OF FOR A THIRTEEN PERCENT. EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT SPLIT INITIALLY. AND WE'LL GET TO THE NINETY TEN SOMETIME IN IN THE FISCAL YEAR. AND A HOW DO YOU INTEND TO. FOLLOW. YOU'RE INTENTION TO GET TO THAT TO. HOT NINETY TEN SPLIT. IN WHAT MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE TO TRACK IT. SO WE'RE WE'RE TRACKING OUR VACANCIES ARE. ON ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE WE GOT OUR REPORTS. WITHIN OUR OUR DISTRICTS AND WITH ALL OF WITHIN THE PROGRAM. AND RIGHT NOW THE PLAN IS TO HIRE A HUNDRED PER MONTH. WITH ATTRITION THAT WOULD GET US TO THE EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BY THE END OF THE YEAR. WITH THE LATEST TOOLS WE HAVE WITH THE HIRING CENTERS WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WILL WILL BE AGGRESSIVELY HIGHEST WILL BRING THE QUALIFIED OUT. CANDIDATES ON BOARD AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND WE THINK THAT THAT. WITH THE THE HIRING CENTERS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT I MENTIONED. THAT NAM WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. OKAY THANK YOU. DOES THE LA WILL HAVE COMMENTS. HOPEFULLY THE SKI WITH THE LA SO. WE THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO FOCUS ON CONTRACTING OUT FOR NEW RESOURCES IN THE NEAR TERM AND WE WOULD SUGGEST EVEN GOING FURTHER IN THAT DIRECTION THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. ARE RATIONALE OF A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THOUGH THE REASON WHY WE THINK YOU SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON CONTRACTING OUT IN THE NEAR TERM. IS THAT. OUR OFFICES HAD SOME CONCERNS IN THE PAST ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF CALTRANS. CAPITAL THEY SUPPORT STUFFING REQUEST. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE FULL M. CONFIDENCE ARM AND THAT THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY THAT THEY USE. SO I THINK IF YOU APPROVE ON CONTRACTING RESOURCES IN THE NEAR TERM AND THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'RE FULLY UTILIZING THEM. THAT IN THE FUTURE. YOU COULD CONSIDER CONVERTING THEM TO US TO PERMANENT NAM STATE STAFF. WE KNOW THAT THE COSTS ARE ROUGHLY THE SAME FOR STATE STAFF AND CONTRACT STAFF WHEN YOU FACTOR IN ALL OF THE INDIRECT COSTS COME FOR STATE STUFF. AT WESTSIDE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROM OPERATIONS FUNDING THAT WAS MENTIONED ON REGARDING THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SPACE STUDY. OUT WE THINK THAT YOU SHOULD REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME AND BECAUSE A CALTRANS HAD NOT YET IDENTIFIED THE SCOPE OF THE WORK WITH DTS. AND INDEED YES WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE OUR OFFICE WITH THE DETAIL ON HOW THEY ESTIMATED THE COST FOR THAT STUDY. AND THEN IN ADDITION. PART THE REQUEST INCLUDES A MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING NEW STAFF THAT'S ONGOING WE THINK IF YOU DO GO IN THE DIRECTION OF ADDING NEW STATE STAFF THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE THAT FUNDING. LIMITED TERM RATHER THAN I'M GOING. THANK YOU I'M WITH RESPECT TO THAT NINETY TEN SPLIT YOU I INDICATED THAT YOU BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. AND MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT CAN YOU. WHERE DOES JUST? WHAT THAT MEANS WHO WERE SUGGESTING TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAD NEW COS RESOURCES SERVE YOU DID WANT TO ADD THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND AND SEVENTY TWO? NEW FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS AT THE MENTION THAT YOU DEDICATE THOSE FOR CONTRACTING OUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR RATHER THAN. STATE STAFF AND THEN MONITOR TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE FULLY UTILIZING THE RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE YOU KHADDAM. CONVERT THEM TO TO STATE STUFF AND WE'VE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW THEY ESTIMATES STAFFING NEEDS TO RETHINK SORT OF TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH A WOULD BE PRUDENT? SIMILAR TO HOW IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN INSTEAD OF ADDING NEW POSITIONS. YOU DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT TO FILL THEIR VACANCIES WHICH THEY'VE BEEN DOING HOME. OKAY THANK YOU ARM AND THE US DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS. THANK YOU A STEEP WALLS HARTMAN FINANCE BOB I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THE BUDGET AS SET UP PROVIDES THE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW US TO. HIRE MORE THAN THE EIGHT HUNDRED POSITIONS WHICH WOULD AS IT STANDS ADDING EIGHT HUNDRED POSITIONS THAT AS OF JULY FIRST WOULD BE MOSTLY VACANT. PUTS US IN A SITUATION FOR BETTER OF OF BEING ABOUT SIXTEEN PERCENT. A ANY VERSES FORTIN EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT STAFF SERVICES AND SO AS WE FILL THROUGH THE YEAR. GETS US TO THAT ABOUT NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT A ANY. AND ODD NINETY POINT FIVE PERCENT OF STAFF SERVICES AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT'S HOW WE GET COME TO THE THREE PERCENT NUMBER. BUT THAT IS MOSTLY BASED ON YOU KNOW WE WE LOOK AT PROJECTIONS WOULD LOOK AT HOW WE'VE BEEN DOING WE LOOK AT. YOU KNOW NEW METHODOLOGIES TO TO TRY TO HIRE PEOPLE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS SO. WE'VE PUT TOGETHER BUDGET THAT IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BUT ALSO PROVIDES US THE FLEXIBILITY TO. IF FOR SOME REASON WERE NOT WE WE HAVE MORE WORKLOAD IN A PARTICULAR MONTH OR A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD THAN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE TO. WE CAN USE THOSE RESOURCES IN A NEW CONTRACTING AND IF WE'VE HIRED MORE RESOURCES THAN WE DID AND IS THUS WE DON'T NEED AS MUCH ANY CONTRACTING WE CAN MOVE THOSE RESOURCES BACK UP SO GIVES US THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S STANDPOINT WERE NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT I IT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW WHO PICKED PICKING UP PICKING A STARTING POINT AS WE ARE ABOUT. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE YEAR. TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PLANNED WORKLOAD WHICH IS THE THE TOTAL THE TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN. OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT WORKLOAD. IS LONG TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO GET TO THAT NUMBER. THAT'S NOT A NUMBER THAT'S NEEDED BASED ON THE BOOK THE WORK PLANS THAT ARE IN PLACE. TO COMPLETE ALL THE WORK OF THE WE NEED TO DO AND FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND IN NINETEEN. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. IT'S PATTERSON ANY QUESTIONS. THE MIND CAN. WHERE'S THE BOARD COULD NINETY. THE DEFENSE FROM LEGISLATION. HARTMAN. THE THE NINETY TEN IT'S JUST BEEN A SORT OF A LONGTIME AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE OF SHARED WITH THE LEDGE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND AN ADMINISTRATION IS JUST SORT OF GONE BY THAT AS A GUIDE. THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM FIFTY FIFTY. OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO I MEAN WEEK AS WE CURRENTLY STAND WE START THE YEAR AT IT EIGHTY FOUR SIXTEEN SO. ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE LESS EMPLOYEES THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE COS. IT ILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF ALL OF THE F. CALTRANS ITEMS COMING UP SHORTLY. SORRY. YOU BAKER IS POPPING UP AND DOWN BACK THERE. YOUR. WE'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT DON'T WORRY. SO. PLEASE PROCEED DATA THROUGH YOUR REMAINING ISSUES. MORNING STEVEN TECH WITH CALTRANS. GOOD MORNING ITEM NUMBER TWO IS A REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION OF APPROPRIATIONS. FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THIS THAT. BUT CORPORATION WAS ORIGINALLY DONE WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND. AND THERE WERE THREE PROJECTS PROGRAM BY THE CDC TO UTILIZE THESE FUNDS. THROUGH THOSE PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION VERY SOON EITHER IN JUNE OR EARLY IN NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THERE WERE SOME PROJECT DELAYS. WITH THE PROJECT IN SOUTH LAKE TAHOE DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL. ISSUES THAT HAVE NOW BEEN RESOLVED ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RESOLVED AND IN THAT PROJECT SHOULD COME FORWARD FOR ALLOCATION EARLY NEXT YEAR. OUT WITH FOR SUCCESSFUL IN. EXTENDING MISAPPROPRIATION THE THIRD PROJECT IS A. RATHER LARGE PROJECT IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IT'S A BIKE SHARE PROGRAM. AND THIS PROJECT IS UNDERGOING DELAYS FOR AN INTERESTING REASON THEY BIKESHARE INDUSTRIES UNDERGOING A TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IF YOU WILL. SO NEW COMPANIES HAVE COME ON THE SCENE. A SORT OF DISRUPTING THE OLD SCHOOL PARADOX BIKESHARE SYSTEM COVER ABOUT DAKHLA SAYS YEAH NOT OVERSEEING GUY I THINK HERE IN SACRAMENTO MANY PLACES IN EXACTLY THE SAME THING SCOOTERS ARE. ARE. A I THINK THE MOST PREVALENT FORM YES I I MYSELF WOULD TAKE A SCOOTER I'M NOT A VERY GOOD BICYCLIST. BUT IN TERMS OF OF THIS PROJECT IS. THEY'RE BASICALLY BEING CHALLENGED BY THE INDUSTRY TO REEVALUATE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND SO. WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT WE NEED THE TIME EXTENSION TO ALLOW OF. A TIME EXTENSION OF THIS APPROPRIATION TO ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO COMPLETE INCOME AND FOUR OF FOR CONSTRUCTION ALLOCATION. IN TERMS OF THE LENGTH OF THE APPROPRIATION. THE LANGUAGE OR PUTTING FORWARD IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE OTHER A. T. P. APPROPRIATION. PERIODS WHERE WE ALLOW A THE TWO YEARS FOR ALLOCATION BY THE CDC IN THE ADDITIONAL THREE FOR INCUMBENTS LIQUIDATION. AND THAT GIVES US THE THE SAFEST TIME PERIOD AND IT BRINGS IT IN LINE WITH. ALL THE OTHER BUDGET REQUESTS OF THIS NATURE. I SAW HOW A IS CALTRANS LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF INTER CONNECTED PRETTY. BETWEEN BIKESHARE SYSTEM SO HOW COULD I WE HAVE A UNUSUAL. SITUATION AND A LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE THERE ARE CURRENTLY. TWO BIKESHARE SYSTEMS THAT. I DON'T TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. AND YET WE HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES MANY OF WHICH BORDER ONE ANOTHER SO I. SANTA MONICA LONG BEACH. UCLA BEVERLY HILLS AND WEST HOLLYWOOD. BEGIN THEIR PROGRAMS BEFORE. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BEGAN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND LA METRO BEGAN THEIR PROGRAM. AND WE NOW HAVE. TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND. HOT AND IN ONE KIND OF BIZARRE CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE. I IN THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA. OF THE. A CITIES BIKESHARE SYSTEM AND METRO AT METRO STATIONS TALKING ABOUT OF PUTTING IN IN THE CITY. PUTTING AND A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. BOB WHICH IS JUST KIND OF CRAZY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. NOW EUROPE LAMENTING A SYSTEM IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HOW IS THAT CAN INTEGRATE INTO. WHAT ALREADY EXISTS? SO THAT'S A VERY DETAILED INDEX AND QUESTION IT I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE THE AS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR AWHILE YOU MIGHT. SO I DON'T HAVE PICKING UP ANOTHER SINCE I. YEAH I CAN. PROMISE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE ANSWERS TO THAT THANK YOU. AYE IF YOU WOULD AYE. WASN'T ANTICIPATING ASKING THE QUESTION IS WHERE WOULD HAVE FOR TRYING TO GET YOU SOONER BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNE TIME I THINK TO. HOPEFULLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REALLY OF ANY COMMENTS. I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WITH THE. LA WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BUT I UNDERSTAND USE THAT THE FUNDS FOR THE. THE THIRD PROJECTS ON HOLD AND ARE LIKELY TO GET RE PROGRAM IS PART OF THE NEXT P. CYCLING TWENTY NINETEEN. IN LIGHT OF THAT AND GIVEN THE RECENT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE DP THREE SB ONE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WISH TO WEIGH THE BENEFITS OF ALLOWING THE AYE ALLOCATED FUNDS INTENDED FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT TO REVERT TO THE G. GRF. AFRICAN OTHER GTF PRIORITIES. THANK YOU YOU MAY WANT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO A CONNECTIVE ISSUE ALSO. A. OKAY SO ISSUE NUMBER TH ISSUE NUMBER THREE. THAT'S LISTED ON THE AGENDA UNDER CALTRANS IS GOING TO. BE DISCUSSED WHEN WE GET TO THE CTC THAT RIGHT. WHICH IS. YES WE'LL DO THAT NEXT THROUGH WILL. PFISTER BAKER WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. AND OF COURSE ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK ON CALTRANS ISSUES. SORRY ABOUT BAKER. GONNA PUT YOU ON HOLD FOR A SECOND BECAUSE WE'RE GOOD AT IT ROLE. DO YOU USE TO IT. NO WORRIES. BLOOM HERE FONG. KALRA MULLIN. PATTERSON. ALRIGHT FINALLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SORRY ABOUT THAT. ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT ISSUES THIS IS A. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO US. AS THE DIRECTOR POINTED OUT CALTRANS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THEIR STAFFING. THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED POSITIONS OVER TEN YEARS. AS WE WENT DOWN BY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED POSITIONS WE DIDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT WORKLOAD. DECREASE WE WENT DOWN AT A RATE OF NINETY TEN. NOW THAT THERE ARE SOME NEW MONEY THE DEPARTMENT IS. PROPOSING THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RATIO OF OUT SOURCING. TO FOURTEEN PERCENT. THAT WE UNDERSTAND THEY PLAN TO GET THEIR ON THE LAST DAY OF THE BUDGET YEAR BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOUR BUDGET WORKS. FOR THE BUDGET WORKS ON AN OVERALL YEAR. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENTS NUMBERS THEY'RE PROPOSING TO CONTRACT OUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF THE WORK ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE YEAR. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE. I AGAIN OUR MEMBERS TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE LA OF SAYS THEY SAY THEY GOT MORE WORK THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. THEY NEED MORE PEOPLE TO DO THAT WORK. ACCORDING TO THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ACOSTA HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER POSITION. TO OUTSOURCE THAT WORK CAN WE THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE MORE ECONOMICALLY IF WE STAFF UP. SP ONE HAS BEEN PASSED FOR A YEAR NOW THE DEPARTMENTS HAD SOME TIME TO PUT OF IT GATHER. THAT STAFFING PLAN WE'VE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THE STAFFING PLAN. PEGS PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT OF LIST OF A THOUSAND NAMES OF PEOPLE THAT ARE READY AND WILLING TO GO TO WORK AS ENGINEERS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEY HAVE THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE HIRING LIST SO WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT. A IS CAPABLE OF STEPPING UP THAT THEY CAN STEP UP MORE ECONOMICALLY AND SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU JUST THE BUDGET TO MAINTAIN THE NINETY TEN. THROUGH THE ENTIRE BUDGET YEAR NOT JUST ON THE LAST DAY OF THE BUDGET YEAR THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS DANIEL LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CHORUS I WANNA FIRST STAR BY APPLAUDING IN THINKING THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR. WORK ON IT INCREASING THE GOALS OF THE STATE IN BOTH CREATING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES BUT ESPECIALLY FOR DELIVERING ON THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AT RISK YOUTH. AND IN THAT VEIN I WANNA SUPPORTER ISSUE NUMBER TWO ON THE ATP PROGRAM IS A VERY NASUS OR NECESSARY. AND RAPIDLY GROWING PROGRAM AND WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY AND THE SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO. REFINE AND EXPAND THAT'S CRITICAL PROGRAM FOR THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. WILL BE TAKING NO ACTION ON THE THIS AND ANY. AND AND. BUT NO ACTION ON THE REST OR ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY.

AND SINCE THIS IS SIR OUR OUR REQUEST ORGANIZED GALLIO TWO PERCENT INTO FIRST PLACE. SURE GOOD MORNING AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROPOSES THAT THE COMMITTEE ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT PLAYING WHICH WRECKING THE LA GO TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM THAT THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION IN THE REPORTER IT WEIGHED OUT EACH AND TO INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF FUNDING IS FOR NON INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMMING SUCH AS BIKE SAFETY COURSES? OUR PROJECT SPONSORS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IMPLEMENTATION. AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PROJECTS ARE LOCATED IN WERE DIRECTLY BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OUR OFFICE CAN WORK WITH STAFF OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO FINALIZE A REASONABLE TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION OF THE REPORT. THANK YOU. DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE COMMENTS SERVICE WE GO DIRECTLY TO CTC.

AYE WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT LA O. COME OUT AND LOOK AT THE PROGRAM AND AT GIVE US AT ANY INPUT THEY HAVE ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. GREAT THANK YOU. AND Y'ALL MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN OUR OPERABILITY ISSUE ON BIKE SHARE THAT. OF THAT I WAS JUST REFERRING TO. SURE I I THINK IT'S A IT'S IT'S ONE VERY SIMILAR TO. WHEN WE FACE WITH THAT TRANSIT PROGRAMS WHERE EVEN AT SANTA MONICA THERE ARE THERE MULTIPLE TRANSIT AGENCIES GOING GOING THROUGH THERE AND THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS INTEROPERABLE. I IT IT A LOT BEEN A PROBLEM FOR DECADES DEFINITELY AND SO NOW. A LOT WILL DEPEND ON WHERE THIS IS AT THIS INDUSTRY IS GOING AS MISTER TECH MENTION AYE IT'S A. A IN ITS IN ITS EXPERIENCING A BIT OF A DISRUPTION TECHNOLOGICALLY. AND SO I. YOU KNOW IF THIS BECOMES MORE LIKE A RENTAL CAR MODEL THAT. IT'S HARD TO SAY AT THAT NO RENTAL CARS CLEARLY ARE NOT INTEROPERABLE SO. I'M NOT SURE THERE IS A BIT THERE'D BE A POSSIBILITY THERE BUT IF WE CAN MAINTAIN IT AS MORE OF OUR. TRANSIT MODEL THAN THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE A POSSIBILITY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ON THIS ITEM. DANIELLE INCH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS AS I WANT REPEAT MY COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY ABOUT JUST KIND OF REITERATE THAT. AND OFFER MY SUPPORT FOR THIS ITEM THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATIONS. NEXT UP IS CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL WE HAVE FOR THE TWO ISSUES GOOD MORNING. MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ASSISTANT CHIEF RICH DESMOND WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. FIRST I WANT TO APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF COMMISSIONER STANLEY. HE'S REGRET YOU CAN'T BE HERE IS IN WASHINGTON DC AT THE NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL ON THE PUBLIC WANT ME TO PASS ON HIS APOLOGY TO FOR. HIS ABSENCE OUT WE GET YOU MENTION IT TO ME ROUTE MAY REVISE ITEMS WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST IS FOR A WIRELESS IN CAR CAMERA SYSTEM. WE'RE REQUESTING FIFTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION AND TWELVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY POSITIONS. PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A WIRELESS IN CAR CAMERA SYSTEM WITH THE OPTION TO PURCHASE AN INTEGRATED BODY WORN CAMERA SYSTEM. AS WELL AS JUST UNDER FOURTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING UP BUDGET ONGOING BUDGET AUGMENTATION FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT. EMMA IMPLEMENTATION COSTS AND POSITIONS WILL BE PHASED IN AS FOLLOWS. IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR POSITIONS AND JUST OVER FIVE MILLION TO WRITE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL CONDUCT PROCUREMENT CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM AND TEST AT A FIELD SITE. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS AND JUST UNDER TWENTY THREE MILLION TO ROLL OUT THIS NEW IN COURT CAMERA SYSTEM TO FIVE OF OUR NINE FEEL DIVISIONS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE REQUEST THREE POSITIONS AND TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION TO DEPLOY TO THE REMAINING FOR FEEL DIVISIONS AND THEN FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO AND ONGOING. A FOURTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION A BUDGET AUGMENTATION TO MAINTAIN ASSIST. WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN IN COARSEST AND THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE SYSTEM RELIES ON THE IS IS ANTIQUATED BECOMING OBSOLETE. IT RELIES ON HARD DRIVES IN OUR PATROL VEHICLES THAT USE DVDS SO WHAT AN OFFICER US TO DO IS IS IS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE THE SHIP THAT AS IT'S RECORDING. INTERACTIONS WITH THE PUBLIC AT THE END OF THE SHIP AND OFFER ACCESS TO TRANSFER THE INFORMATION ON THE HARD DRIVE ONTO A DVD AND THE BOOK THAT DVD INTO EVIDENCE IS VERY. IF IT TAKES A LOT OF MANUAL INTERACTION BY THE OFFICERS FOR THIS FOR THE SYSTEM. THE HARBOR IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING AS YOU CAN TELL JUST BY THE FACT THAT WERE USING DVD STILL IT'S AN OLD SYSTEM. AND THE VENDORS TOLD US THEY WILL NO LONGER BILL TO SERVICE OR REPAIR THE EQUIPMENT BEYOND THE END OF THIS YEAR. DUE TO LACK OF REPLACEMENT PARTS. PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THESE FAILURES IN THE LACK OF THE ABILITY TO REPAIR THEM WE ESTIMATE THAT IN LESS THAN A YEAR OVER HALF OF OUR FORTUNE VEHICLES WILL NOT HAVE ANY REPORTING CAPABILITY. WE REALIZE THIS DOES NOT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF OF POLICYMAKERS CONTEMPORARY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR THE PUBLIC WE SERVE CERTAINLY. IT'S BECOME WIDELY ACCEPTED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE RECORDING SYSTEMS THAT DOCKING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE PUBLIC TO IMPROVE. TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY EVIDENCE COLLECTION. WITH THIS NEW SYSTEM WE HOPE TO HAVE EVERY IN FORTUNE VEHICLE INCLUDE OUR MOTORCYCLES BECAUSE WILL BE A MUCH SMALLER SYSTEM. AND OUR COMMERCIAL FORCE UNITS EQUIPPED WITH AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING CAPABILITY THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. MORE RELIABLE AND MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. ALONG WITH THE REQUEST FOR THE IN CAR SYSTEM IS A REQUEST TO. RE APPROPRIATE THE REMAINING BALANCE OF FUNDS WE RECEIVED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO CONDUCT A PILOT PROGRAM TO STUDY BODY WORN CAMERA BODY OR CAMERAS ARE OFFICERS. WE COMPLETED THAT STUDY. TOWARDS THE END OF LAST YEAR. ACTUALLY DEPLOYED BODYWORK CAMERAS IN OUR OAKLAND FIELD OFFICE AND STOCKTON FIELD OFFICE. AND IT WAS IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED THE CAMERAS WERE VERY WELL RECEIVED BY THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY AND AND BY THE ACTION THE OFFICERS WEARING THE CAMERAS. SO WAS VERY POSITIVE HOWEVER THERE WERE SOME POLICY IN TECHNOLOGY ISSUES THAT WE STILL THINK WEEK WE SHOULD BE WORKING THROUGH AND TO WORK FOR REQUESTING THE REMAINING THE REMAINDER OF THOSE FUNDS BE RE APPROPRIATED SO WE CAN DO ONE MORE YEAR. OF A PILOT. THE GOOD NEWS IS IS AT THE END OF THE ANOTHER YEAR WE WILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOWN THE ROAD ASSUMING YOU APPROVE OUR IN CAR CAMERA REQUEST WILL ALREADY BE DOWN THE ROAD WITH DEVELOPING THIS SYSTEM. WHICH WE WILL. WE WILL DESIGN TO INCORPORATE A STATEWIDE BODY WORN CAMERAS EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE SO BE IT AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS WHAT WE WILL BE PURSUING FOR THE IN CAR CAMERAS. THE OTHER THE OTHER ITEM I MAY REVISE ITEM WE HAVE. THAT WE'RE REQUESTING HIS RE AUTHORIZATION TO PROCEED WITH REPLACING OUR TRACY AREA OFFICE AS A LEASE BILL TO SUIT. WE MITCHELL RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR THIS PROJECT AND THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUDGET ACT BUT THE AUTHORITY HAS SINCE EXPIRED. OUR TREATY OFFICE IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN FOUR LACKS FACILITY REQUIREMENTS SPACE INSIDE ME CAPABILITIES THAT THAT WE REQUIRE TODAY. ON THE PROJECT WAS DELAYED FOR SEVERAL REASONS BE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER AWARDED THE LEASE. THE UNIT REGIONALES IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND CONSULTATION WITH DTS I WAS TERMINATED DUE TO LACK OF PERFORMANCE AND THE WE HAD IT AT TWO ADDITIONAL. DEVELOPERS. BOTH HAD TO PULL OUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS WE HAVE NOT HAD GOOD LUCK WITH THIS PROJECT. I'M BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS DDS HAD SELECTED A FOURTH DEVELOPER IS CONFIDENT OF THE DEVELOPERS ABILITY TO PERFORM ON THE CONTRACT. I MEAN I KNOW DIGESTS IS HERE FOR THAT ANYTHING TO ADD TO THIS PROPOSAL. DID YOU WANT DO THAT NOW FROM I'M. FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCED TO CLOSE OUR BORDERLANDS ART VERY VERY SORRY SOMEBODY IT'S UP WE CAN YOU KNOW. BUT I'M SURE QUITE HOW TO RESTORE THAT SORT ITEM. MCGRIFF I WROTE I APOLOGIZE. BUT. AND AND SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU CONSIDERING THESE REQUESTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THINK IT WITH THANK YOU WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE AND CAR SYSTEM AT AT. SOUNDS LIKE GOTTA. YOUR WAY OUT OF DATE TERMS OF THE. EQUIPMENT THAT THAT YOU'RE USING. AND I UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING MEDIA IS DVD SO DOES THAT MEAN OR MOVING TO A CLOUD BASED SYSTEM. AND. AND THAT WOULD BE WIRELESS HOW DOES THAT. TRANSMIT TO THE CLOUD. AND THAT IS IT STORED IN THE VEHICLE AND THEN TRANSMITTED WHEN IT. RETURNS TO THE STATION ARE. AT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN IT'S RICH RELEA. A SYSTEM THAT MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED IN CAR CAMERA SYSTEMS ARE USING THESE DAYS IT'S ALL DIGITAL AND IT AUTOMATICALLY UPLOADED WHEN OFFICER PULLS INTO THE STATION FOR INSTANCE SO YOU WOULDN'T YOU WON'T HAVE THE OFFICER HAVE AN INTERACTIVE THAT. AND JUST DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL WE'RE SO SPREAD OUT IN SOME REGIONS OF THE STATE'S.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COULD MONNING MEMBERS A MILLION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT. QUESTIONS FROM DYESS. SEEING NONE. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPENS. ALONG WITH OUR OTHER ITEMS AND. THAT TEXAS TO THE HOME STRETCH WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND PIZZA. OF GUTHRIE ISSUES. AND ONE PRESENTER. GOOD MORNING WHEN CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. ENTERTAINING THIS ISSUE THIS MORNING. WE'VE THREE ISSUES AS YOU NOTED BEFORE YOU THE FIRST IS WITH REGARD TO. BUT THE ENERGY RESOURCES PROGRAM ACCOUNT WHICH IS OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING ENGINE OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND IT IS IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. SO WE HAVE PROPOSED SOME. WAYS TO FIX THAT PROBLEM HOW TO YOU TODAY I THINK YOUR STAFF DID A GOOD JOB OF OUTLINING THOSE IN YOUR AGENDA. A DISCO OVER A SUMMARIZE THE RECENTLY BUT TO BACK UP HIS SENSE OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. IN CALIFORNIA WE. WE LOOK AT THIS IS BEING VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS THE. PATROL OUR URGES A SMALL CHARGE ON EACH PERSON'S A POWER BILL. AND AS WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL UP OVER THE LAST YEARS AND CLEAN ENERGY IN A DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND THEN BEHIND THE METER ENERGY CONSUMPTION WERE UP TO NEARLY SIX. GIGAWATTS OF BEHIND THE METER. CHIEFLY ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT'S BROUGHT DOWN THE OVERALL CHARGES AND CONSEQUENTLY THIS. BUT FUND WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA THE LOWEST PER CAPITA CONSUMER OF ENERGY IN THE COUNTRY. SO. THAT'S BEEN THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IN COUPLED WITH THAT IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE FLAG THIS FOR THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO BUT COUPLED WITH THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE FIFTY. AND SOME OTHER LEGISLATION WE'VE GOT IT BUT ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES PENSION HAVE GONE UP WHILE OUR REVENUES HAVE HAVE GONE DOWN. THAT'S WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY WE DID LAST YEAR SLASH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR BUDGET. BUT WE'RE DOWN TO WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SOME SHIPS IN ORDER TO ROOM AND. REMAIN WHOLE SO THE PROPOSAL DE CALLS FOR A COUPLE THINGS MAINLY. REMOVING A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF FUNDS THE DEFICIT IS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR SORE PROPOSAL TO MOVE. A NUMBER OF POSITIONS FROM THE IRP ACCOUNT TO THE COIA COST OF IMPLEMENTATION ACCOUNT WE WENT AND IDENTIFIED POSITIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTOR PERFORMING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE COIL ACCOUNT NAMELY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND SO THE PROPOSALS TO SHIFT A NUMBER OF POSITIONS THERE UP SECOND WERE PROPOSING TO CONVERT OTHER POSITIONS FROM A FUND KNOWN AS THE E. THE ENERGY FACILITY LICENSE FUND SO WHEN YOU. ARE A POWER PLANT. OPERATOR ANYONE ABOUT IT TO BUILD A POWER PLANT. WE'RE THE AGENCY THAT PERMITS THOSE. THOSE THOSE PLANS AND CONDUCTS OF A YEAR LONG A LICENSING ANALYSIS ON THAT AND SO WE WOULD SHIP SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS. OVER TO THE FUND THAT IS GENERATED BY THOSE ACTIVITIES OFF OF THE IRP ACCOUNT AGAIN TO RELIEVE SOME MORE THE PRESSURE ON THE ON THE. PER COUNT AND FINALLY IN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT WILL NOTED HERE. WE PROPOSE THAT STATUTORILY WERE ALLOWED IN NOVEMBER OF EACH YEAR TO RAISE THAT SURCHARGE THAT WE HAVE THE GENERATES THOSE FUNDS. BUT AND WERE AT THE NEAR THE CAPS WE CAN RAISE A BY ONE ADDITIONAL MILL. WHICH IS ABOUT SEVEN CENTS PER RESIDENTIAL CONSUMER PER YEAR SUCH A VERY MODEST INCREASE BUT IT DOES GENERATE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT WOULD GO INTO THEIR PARK OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS LA RAIL. COM YEAH. THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A SCAN SIGNIFICANT IN OUR VIEW A REASONABLE STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING THE. THE DEFICIT IN THE FUNDS. WE WE DON'T HAVE ANY INITIAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES WE DOLLAR. IS IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GOING FORWARD AND SO. IT'S WITHOUT ITS PROJECTED TO GO INSOLVENT TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO THERE'S A THERE IS SOME MORE TIME TO KIND OF ADDRESS IT BUT THE LEGISLATURE WILL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND THE. PART OF THE. RESOLUTION HERE IS TAKING FUNDS FROM THE KOREA COUNTER SHIFTING BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDS OF THE QUAKE COUNT. HOW SOLVENT IS THAT FUND AND? IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT BUNDIST GENERATING A SURPLUS. AGAIN AMENDMENT PARTNER FINANCE BE UP QUITE A FIND IS OF THE THE CHARGES THAT GOING TO FIND OUR REASSESS OUR LOOKED AT EVERY YEAR BASED ON WHAT THE APPROPRIATION LEVEL IS AND SO THOSE THOSE WILL BE ADJUSTED. BASED ON THE TOTAL PROPOSALS NOT ONLY THIS ONE BUT I THINK ONCE THE IMPACT THAT FUND SO THAT IT WILL MAINTAIN SOLVENCY AND WE DID HAVE THERE'S A LETTER OF CONCURRENCE FROM THE TIME AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO THIS PROPOSAL. PLEASE MISTER PATTERSON SO IT AND. NUMBER IS DONE TO STAND THE IT TO THE TO THE ALEJO. A FUND. WE'LL GO INSOLVENT BY GET WHAT TWENTY. EIGHT. WHEN YOU SEE TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAT'S THE PROJECTION GIVEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN THAT'S THE PRODUCTION THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN. SO THE. WILL YOU BE COMING BACK TO US SOON TO RAISE THE CAP ON THE FIFTH ON THAT. THE CHARGE RATEPAYERS. WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IS IS IT MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT CAN ATTEST. REGULARLY WITH DIFFERENT FINE IT'S LOOKING AT OTHER OTHER SOLUTIONS AS I POINTED OUT IN MY TESTIMONY WE HAVE REDUCED OUR COSTS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. SO THERE'S A SUITE OF OPTIONS WERE CONSIDERING AS WE LOOK AT THIS BUT. AS AS ALEJO POINTS OUT THERE IS A OUT HERE DEFICIT. STRUCTURALLY AND WERE WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CLOSE IT RIGHT THAT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. YOU'RE NOW YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE RAISING THE FEE. TO ITS CAP SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER ROOM. TO CLOSE THIS DEFICIT UNLESS YOU CUT. EXPENDITURES THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU INTEND. DO YOU INTEND TO COME BACK. FERRICK FOR IT FOR. LIFTING THE CAP I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED WHAT I SAID THAT LOWERING EXPENDITURES IS ONE OPTION ANOTHER OPTION IS THERE ARE ADDITIONAL WAYS THAT FUNDS CAN BE SHIFTED FROM ONE ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER SO THIS IS ONLY ONE OF. A DOZEN OR MORE ACCOUNTS THAT WE HAVE AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND WE PARTIED WOULD DESCRIBE SOME OF THE SHIPS THIS MORNING AND THERE ARE OTHERS. SO PART OF IT COULD BE SHIFTING FUNDS NOT NECESSARILY. EITHER REDUCING OR INCREASING FUNDS TO THE HERBA COUNTED DOES THE LA JOH. I THINK THAT THERE'S ENOUGH. AB ABILITY IN IT INTER. DEPARTMENTAL FUND. IN INTER ACCOUNT SHIFTING. IN ORDER LOSE THE GAP BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I MEAN I THINK IT'S THAT'S HARD TO SAY. I THINK WE. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT I THINK IN THE OUTTA KINDA TRY TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE I THINK. ONE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE NOTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD OUT A REPORT ON THIS ISSUE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IN THAT REPORT IS THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS LIKE PROP THIRTY NINE FOR EXAMPLE THAT RECEIVE SOME OF THE. BUT FUNDING. AND STE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THOSE PROGRAMS COULD BE EXPIRING AND FUTURE YEARS IN SUCH AN EXTENT THAT OCCURS IN THAT WOULD FREE UP SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO THERE'S A. FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE BUT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL RIGHT NOW TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW. RIGHT THANK YOU FAIRS TO THINK FURTHER I THINK GO WE ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. ACTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AT THE END OF ALL THREE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE TO MORE. OF WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT PROGRAM YES SIR THIS IS A REQUEST THROUGH MAY REVISE FOR AN INCREASE OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES TO THE. FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM THIS BUILDS ON A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT LAST YEAR IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. IN AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE JAN TEN BUDGET THE GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUED EARLIER THIS YEAR. OTHER BRINGS THE TOTAL IF THIS MEASURE WERE APPROVED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT THIS IS FOR IS FOR OUR FOOD PRODUCTION INDUSTRY IT'S AN EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA EMPLOYS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OF WORKERS? AND WHAT THIS FUND IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO ASSIST THEM IN THE TRANSITION TO A CLEANER ENERGY PRODUCTION AT THEIR FACILITIES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH. OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES% THAT ARE DOING SIMILAR ACTIVITIES THE DEMAND FROM THE FOLKS WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITHIN THE INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL MONTHS AS WE'VE BUILT OUR PROPOSAL FOR A. SOLICITATION THAT'S GONNA GO OUT THIS MONTH TO INVITE APPLICATIONS FROM THIS INDUSTRY. WE'VE LEARNED THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED IN PROJECTS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT THEIR FACILITIES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO. WE LOOK AT THIS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AS A A GOOD ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND AS I SAY WE'RE GONNA PUT THE SOLICITATION OF THIS MONTH AND WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS ARE EAGER TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OF MISTER MALONE SO THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY FROM GEO FROM JANUARY IS JUST NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE DEMAND THAT'S OUT THERE. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S REYES MONITOR OF PROCESS AND WE STARTED IT WITHOUT A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE DEMAND MIGHT BE BUT AS WE'VE GONE FURTHER THIS IS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TRANSITION NOW IN THE. A AG INDUSTRY TO. A NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ARE YOU ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT TRANSITION THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO BUILD IN. AT ENERGY EFFICIENCIES WE SURE HOPE SO. I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IN AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL GIVEN TIME CONSTRAINTS BUT WERE BREAKING UP THE SOLICITATION INTO TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TEARS THE FIRST IS FAIRLY. STRAIGHT FORWARD TYPES OF ENERGY REDUCTION ACTIVITIES AND CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES LIKE SOLAR. THE SECOND IS MUCH MORE CUTTING EDGE AND SO THE SECOND TIER WERE GONNA AND AND THESE ARE LARGER AWARDS OF FOLKS ARE SUCCESS RENT WE'RE GONNA ASK FOLKS TO. PROPOSE. CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NOT WIDELY USED IN CALIFORNIA. IT THE BUT THAT'S BEEN PROVEN ELSEWHERE TO WORK SO THAT WE CAN BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES HERE TRIMARK KICK THE TIRES SEE IF THEY WORK HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD THEN SPREAD TO OTHER. OTHER PARTS OF THE THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE SOLAR THERMAL MICHAEL GIVE GRADES FUEL SWITCHING. THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. IT'S INTERESTING. SING NO OTHER QUESTIONS ALEJO. YOU WERE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST THE ENERGY COMMISSION ONLY RECENTLY FINALIZED THE FUNDING GUIDELINES FOR THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS ALLOCATED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THE INITIAL PROJECT THE WORDS ARE NOT EXPECTED UNTIL THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO AS A RESULT THAT MAGNITUDE OF THE ESTIMATED BENEFITS INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND OTHER LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS FROM THE PROJECT IS IT'S STILL UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME. I SECOND IF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THESE PROJECTS A HIGH PRIORITY THERE'S OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE NAMELY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. WHICH. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AT THIS YEAR TO THE EXTENT THIS UP PROGRAM IS A HIGH PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE. TO CONSIDER REALLOCATING. ALLOCATING A GTR UP FUNDS FOR THIS PROGRAM AND JUST FOR CONTEXT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CAP AND TRADE PLAN THERE'S ROUGHLY. TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN OVERALL GIGI R. F. OF FUNDING. FOR. FOR GREENHOUSE GAS RELATED ACTIVITIES. THIS APPROACH WOULD LEAVE SOMEWHAT LESS FUNDING IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO REALLOCATE TO THIS PROGRAM WOULD LEAVE SOMEWHAT LESS FUNDING FOR OTHER CLIMATE REGULAR RELATED ACTIVITIES. BUT WOULD FREE UP. THESE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS PER THE LEGISLATURE'S HIGHS PRIORITIES. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOCIETY ONE OF RESPOND. TO THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM CERTAINLY. THIS THERE IS ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE ON A ONE TIME BASIS OF WHERE I'M INCREASING FROM A PROPOSAL OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION. DID YOUR AFTER A TOTAL OF SIXTY FOUR MILLION WHICH WILL KEEP IT IN LINE WITH. HOW MUCH IS PROVIDE LAST YEAR THE SIXTY MILLION SO BEAR I'M CONTINUING THAT MOMENTUM? AMOUNT FOR THIS FOR THIS PROGRAM AT THE SAME LEVEL. AND I'M TO DEALERS COMMENTS IT'S A TRADE OFF NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IF YOU. DECIDE NOT TO FIND THIS IS JOHN FUND AND FUND IT WITH YEAR GIGI RFU ARE TRADING PRIORITIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TRAFFIC CAP AND TRADE THE FUNDS WITH WITH GENTLE FUN ON A ONE TIME BASIS AS WE HAVE PROPOSED. YOUR TRADING PRIORITIES WITH THE GENERAL FUND SO WE WE THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM AND KEEP IT THE SAME LEVELS THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR THANK YOU ARE WOULD ONLY A. COMMENT THAT THE. THERE'S ALREADY. GHG FUNDING GOTTA I EMBARKED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN. EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO UP UP PART WAS GENERAL FUND MONEY SO. DEATH SINGLE BUT UNUSUAL. CANADA. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DYESS. LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE. THANK YOU THE THIRD ITEM IS. AS BRIEF IT IS BUT NOT ASKING FOR FUNDING BUT INSTEAD JUST AUTHORITY FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO EXPAND UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WE DON'T EXPECT TO BE THAT MUCH. BUT TO. DUE TO FUND REIMBURSEMENT FOR PER DIEM AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES ADVISORY GROUP THAT HAS BEEN JOINTLY ESTABLISHED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION. UP MEMBERS WERE SELECTED AND ADOPTED BY BOTH BOTH OF OUR AGENCIES IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS THIS OBLIGATION AROSE OUT OF S. B. THREE FIFTY AS WELL RESPONSIBLE I'M FOR GOING OUT HOW TO GET IT RIGHT IN REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITIES THAT WILL BE IMPACTED. SO THE GROUP ASSEMBLED AND THIS AGAIN IS JUST TO PROVIDE. INABILITY TO TO REIMBURSE FOLKS FROM A DIVERSE PART OF OUR PARTS OF OUR STATE FOR TRAVEL AND A AND PER DIEM. ALRIGHT. ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THAT ILIO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY. ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSAL AND CONCEPTS ARE WE DO NOT THAT THAT COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT. ASKS THE ADMINISTRATION TO DESCRIBE HOW THE BASIS FOR THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP. AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS RELATIVELY HIGH. SO THAT COMMITTEE MIGHT WHEN ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON THAT. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN RESPONSE TO THAT SIBELIUS QUESTION COMMENT. IT IT'S MEANT TO BE A CAP WE DON'T I GET IT AT THE CAP ACROSS THE TWO DEPARTMENTS OF EACH DEPARTMENT MAXIMUM OF FIFTY THOUSAND AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT. ONE NIGHT HOTEL STAND TEMP DISCO IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TIMES ELEVEN PEOPLE MONTHLY MEETINGS YOU KNOW.

ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE AG EFFICIENCY DOLLARS HOW WE WANNA. SHARKS. AREEXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR BRINGING TOGETHER THIS GROUP. HOW WE REALIZE IT FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME TO GET THIS DONE BUT I THINK THEY'RE REALLY DOING THE PROCESS RIGHT? AND AS YOU HEARD THE DEMAND IS OUT THERE. WE NEED TO MAKE THESE EFFICIENCIES IN THE PROCESSING ELEMENT OF OUR INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION AYE ELEMENT OF OUR INDUSTRY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT GARY PROCESSING IN THE NUMBER OF JOBS IT PROVIDES FOOD PROCESSING THE NUMBER JOBS IT PERSONAL PROVIDES WITHOUT THESE ONIES TO ALLOW THEM TO BE EFFICIENT AND TO MEET THE S. B. THIRTY TWO GOALS. WE WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT LINKAGE WE WILL SEE THESE PLANTS CLOSE WE WILL SEE THEM LEAVE THE STATE IF THAT HAPPENS WE LOSE JOBS WE ALSO CREE SIGNIFICANT HARM FOR THE PRODUCTION SIDE THE INDUSTRY.
