THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE TIME. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX A MEASURE THAT REDUCES DUPLICATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LITIGATION THE DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF DESPERATELY NEEDED NEW HOUSING BY CREATING A MORE EXPEDITIOUS AND COST EFFECTIVE PROCESS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA HOUSING LAWS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING. THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF ITS RESIDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN DAY. AS REPORTED BY THE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AS A STATE WE HAVE RELIED ON ONE TIME SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS AND HAVE WITNESSED ARE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION ONLY CONTINUE TO RISE. IN CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THE HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN EVERY EIGHT YEARS A PROCESS THAT CITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING. DUE TO THE CHANGES OF STATE LAW GOVERNING THE CRITERIA USED TO DETERMINE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT MORE JURISDICTIONS WILL NEED TO ACCOMMODATE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HOUSING TARGETS THAN PREVIOUS CYCLES. IN MY DISTRICT LAWCENTER THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WILL NEED TO ACCOMMODATE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO FACILITATING THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING IS A LONG IN THE TOOTH AND LITIGIOUS. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS REQUIRED TO CREATE NEW HOUSING. THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND SEE WHAT CLEARANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE AND SUBSEQUENT REZONING ORDINANCE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. AND REQUIRE EXPENSIVE STUDIES WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY SHOULD THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE BE LITIGATED. IN THE STUDY OF ALL HOUSING UNITS CHALLENGED IN SEQUEL LAWSUITS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS REGIONS BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TWO YEAR PERIOD WITHIN THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS WERE CHALLENGING SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE STATISTICS. 98% OF THESE UNITS WERE WITHIN EXISTING COMMUNITIES MEANING THEY WERE NOT IN NEW GREENFIELD DEVELOPMENTS. 70% WERE WITHIN A HALF MILE OF PUBLIC TRANSIT STOPS OR QUARTERS PRIORITY GROWTH AREAS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S MAN MANDATORY. HOUSING AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS 78% OF THOSE WARREN WHITER WEALTHIER GEOGRAPHIC'S A GEOGRAPHIES. SUCH AS THE WEST SIDE AS OPPOSED TO COMMUNITIES WOULD RELATIVELY HIGHER MINORITY OR POVERTY RATES. AND LOWER EDUCATIONAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS DIRECTLY INHIBITS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE HOUSING POLICIES AND IMPEDES THE ABILITY TO FACILITATE HOUSING PRODUCTION TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CRISIS. PARTICULARLY. IN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD PROVIDE REGULATORY CLARITY TO MUNICIPALITIES AND ALLOW A MORE DISTINCTIVE PATH TO COMPLYING WITH STATE AND REGIONAL HOUSING CAPACITY GOALS. BY LIMITING SPEAKER REVIEW OF HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATES TO A GENERAL PLAN ADDITIONALLY AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. WHEN IMPLEMENTING A HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE THAT INCLUDE THE STATE REQUIRED REZONING PROGRAM A MUNICIPALITY WILL BE ALLOWED TO UTILIZE A PREVIOUSLY CERTIFIED. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND LIMIT ANALYSIS TO SITE SPECIFIC IMPACTS AGAIN. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING TO. REDUCE OUR HOMELESSNESS POPULATION AND ENSURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT'S ON HOUSE STAR ON HOUSE NEIGHBORS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HOUSE THEN WE CAN ONLY DO HAT IF WE ACTUALLY BUILD THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO BUILD. IN OUR CITIES AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY IS LOWER ACROSS SICK WITH THE OFFICE OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. THANK YOU OF SO WE ARE READY FOR THE WITNESS IN SUPPORT. OF MODERATOR CAN YOU- PUT HER THROUGH. YES ONE MOMENT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIE NUMBER THIRTY TWO IS GO AHEAD. HOWEVER. THANK YOU TERRY BYE LARA AND MEMBERS OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CLARK PROJECT PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT MANAGER IN THE OFFICE ERIC ARE STUDYING THEIR BLOCKS AND SALAS WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX INTRIGUED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENDY CARILLO AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY LOS ANGELES AND CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF UPDATING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT AS PART OF THE SIX REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT OR REUNIFY. AND BAG REGION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS HAVE HOUSING ELEMENT YOU IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THIS PROCESS WILL REQUIRE THE CITY TO ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS WHICH ARE PERSPECTIVE IS EQUAL TO NEARLY ONE THIRD. OF THE CITY'S EXISTING HOW. OTHER OVERALL GREEN AT HER FIFTY SEVEN PER ARE LOW MODERATE HOW. AND ALL OF THESE UNITS ARE NEWS TO HELP RESPOND ON GOING SHOPPING AT HOME. RIGHT LOS ANGELES IS EMBRACE PROCESS AND TO LEAVE THE FOUNDATION REQUIRED TO BUILD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM CAN BE A REALITY FOR ALL INJURIES. EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL BETTER ENABLE US TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS. IT WILL REDUCE THE NEAREST OF UNNECESSARY DELAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LITIGATION ABUSE UNDER SPEAK WHAT THAT WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO SET US BACK AND EXACERBATE. THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF REQUIRED ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MUST UNDERTAKE THE UPDATE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT. AND OUR SUBSEQUENT REZONING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE PREDICTABLE PROCESS FOR COMPLYING WITH STATE HOUSING LAW AND ACHIEVING OUR HOUSING AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. ELDERTON NOT CHANGE ANY REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE CARIBBEAN FOR INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. NOR DOES THE BILL EXEMPTS ORDINANCES TO RESEMBLE TYPES FROM SECORD RUBIO. STATE BUDGET AND MADE THEM CHANGES THE RING A PROP AND YOU KNOW THAT. RESULTING IN MUCH HIGHER HOUSING TARGETS HOWEVER OUR EFFORTS TO UPDATE OUR LOCAL POLICIES AND NECESSARY REGULATORY CHANGES WILL BE LARGELY INEFFECTIVE FOR THE COMING SEVERAL YEARS AT BURDEN BY THESE UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND LITIGATION. HOUSING ELEMENT THERE BEING UPDATED RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE STATE AND IT IS VITAL THAT WE NEED A CRISIS WITH URGENCY.

MISTER MISTER SIRE TO- ATFIRST I WANT TO COMMEND AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- FROM A CITIES PERSPECTIVE- THE RENOWNED ISSUE IS A HUGE ISSUE- IT'S VERY HARD FOR CITIES TO DEAL WITH STATE MANDATES AND THEN RUN INTO THESE ROADBLOCKS THAT KEEP THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE STATE MANDATE. AND SO- WE'RE ARENA IS CONCERNED A LOT OF COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO DO THE PLANNING NECESSARY- BUT BECAUSE OF THE ROAD BLOCKS THAT ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS BILL- THEY CANNOT. AND FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY- MAYBE OUTSIDE OF LABOR- THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR INABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER A PROJECT AND GET IT DONE WITHIN. YOU KNOW A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE CARING COSTS AND ALL THESE OTHER COSTS. IF WE ARE AND IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS. AND IMPLEMENT PROPER THESE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING- I THINK. YOUR BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- SO- YOU KNOW EIGHT IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE. THE PROCESS IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS. YOU KNOW AND- S. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY LESS- OUR PROCESS THEY THEY WANT THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO BE PROTECTED CLOSE BUT WHAT YOUR BILL IS TALKING ABOUT IS THE DUPLICATE OF PARTS OF THIS AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SECRET PROCESS DOWN ON ONE SIDE AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER LAYER AND THEN ANOTHER LAYER AND ALL THESE LAYERS TOGETHER- AND I'VE SEEN PROJECT AFTER PROJECT STALLED OUT NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A GOOD PROJECT IT'S BECAUSE THEY USE THAT THAT. THAT LAWSUIT FOR LEVERAGE- TO GET SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT AND I SUSPECT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS. BUT BUT OUR JOB IS TO REMOVE THE HURDLES THAT ARE STANDING BETWEEN US IN ACHIEVING THE GOAL. OF GETTING PEOPLE INTO REASONABLE REASONABLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL EVER REACH THAT- BUT TO IN ERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND I THINK- I THIS IS THIS IS A- A GOOD EFFORT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I'M I'M GONNA MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THIS. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A FARM. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- BUT I.

THANK YOU- MATTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS- THIS IS A WE ARE LIVING THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE OUR OUR HOMELESSNESS POPULATION CONTINUE TO RISE AND OUR- OUR NEED TO ACTUALLY BUILD BUILD MORE HOUSING AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX REDUCES THE PUT OF THEM ARE REVIEW AND UPPER FOR THE THAT THE LADY COMES. OF DESPERATELY NEW BACK MORE EXPERT AND OF PROCESS FOR LOW JURORS. TO COMPLY WITH CAL HOUSE LAWS I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING OUR LABOR PARTNERS AND THOSE THAT CALLED IN A WHO WE'VE HEARD FROM AND WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SAYS THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED AND CONTINUES TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR US TO GET TO. A GOOD PLACE I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT IN MY OWN PARTICULAR CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE ARE AT WE ARE A LABOR CITY AND I WOULD NOT BE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE- THE SUPPORT FROM THE BUILDING TRADES AND OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT ACTUALLY CREATE THE HOUSING THAT'S NECESSARY FOR SO MANY OF OUR OWN HOUSE NEIGHBORS AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESSING THE VERY REAL REALITY THAT WE NEED TO REFORM CERTAIN PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT SIMPLY JUST GET IN THE WAY OF US BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH THE PROMISES THAT WE MAKE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ACTUALLY FINDING SOLUTIONS TO OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND THAT INCLUDES OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO BUILD. MORE HOUSING TO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT IN AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- SO WE HAVE A MOTION. FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY OUR TOTAL OF SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS.

YEAH YEAH PARTY I THINK HE'S YEAH HI FOR FOUR HOURS. GOOD GARCIA. WE HAVE FIVE ZERO WILL LEAVE IT OPEN THANK YOU. I'M NEXT WE HAVE AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU CHAIR AB AT ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN TAKES A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO SET CALIFORNIA ON THE COURSE TO MEET THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS BY MAKING CHANGES AT THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS TO PROVIDE TOOLS ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES FOR METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS TO MEET THEIR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE REGIONAL GHG EMISSION TARGETS. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES CLIMATE AND PROTECTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BY A NOW MAYOR STEINBERG WAS A FIRST OF ITS KIND LAW TO RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND HOUSING DECISIONS TO MAKE TO MEET STATE CLIMATE GOALS. SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE REQUIRES EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN REGIONAL METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS TO INCLUDE A NEW ELEMENT AND THEIR LONG RANGE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY. THIS STRATEGY IDENTIFIES WAYS THAT MUNICIPALITIES CAN REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FROM DRIVING WHICH CAN OF COURSE OF COURSE LEAD TO HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES AND MORE EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER REPORTS FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE L. A. O. AND OTHERS HAVE STATED THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO REALIZE THE GHG REDUCTIONS IT EXPECTS UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE OR THE IMPORTANT CO BENEFITS. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN REQUIRES EACH MPO TO CREATE A TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TARGET ACTION PLAN. AND DEVELOP. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT A NEW BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THESE NPOS TO ACHIEVE THEIR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT THEIR NPOS. ABOVE HIS PLANS AND REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INNOVATIVE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THAT MAY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. REDUCING THAT THOSE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED VMT GENERATES MANY BENEFITS INCLUDING ALLEVIATING TRAFFIC CONGESTION REDUCING AIR POLLUTION REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL. IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH INCREASED EXERCISE. AND SAFETY AND ENHANCING INTERACTIONS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. AS THIS BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE CITY'S WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS IT MOVES FORWARD. A TODAY I HAVE CARTER RUBIN FROM OF THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND WILL BEAR IT FROM THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I WOULD REQUEST YOUR I. BOATS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT POLICY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I JUST WANNA REMIND THE TWO WITNESSES THAT YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE. OF ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. YOUR LINES ARE OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS THI IS CARTER WRITTEN WITH ENERGY SEAT I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO HALT CLIMATE CHANGE EXTEND TO OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND POOR AIR QUALITY AND DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT OF PRESIDENT DISASTERS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT POURS MORE FUEL ON THAT FIRE. OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES HAVE RATED THE ALARM THAT OUR CURRENT TRANSPORTATION POLICIES ARE PUSHING MORE ROAD TO MY TO ROADS BETWEEN- GENERATE OR DRIVING. SO AB ALONE SEVEN BUILT ON THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND SB ONE FIFTY. RECOGNIZE THE FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS GIVING CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THEY CONSISTENTLY ASK FOR. THE OPTION TO GET AROUND WITHOUT GETTING IN THEIR CARS. AB ON FORTY SEVEN FACILITATES THE SHIFT BY ALIGNING OUR STATE TRANSPORTATION BUTTON WITH THESE PRIORITIES. WILL MAKE SURE REGIONAL PLANS ARE HELPING REDUCE DRIVING AND APPROVAL TURN IT IS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE MAKE OUR VEHICLE FLEET CLEANER. THIS IS IMPORTANT THIRTY TWO CARBON EMISSIONS FAST ENOUGH TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND AS THE CO BENEFIT. OF REDUCING LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS TO GET REGION'S BACK ON TRACK IN MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS EITHER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. AND IT'S BILLS SUPPORT MAJOR INVESTMENTS REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A HUGE APPETITE FOR THIS. THE LAST ROUND ENACTED TRANSPORTATION GRANT SOUGHT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING REQUEST TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT THERE THE CDC HAD TO ALLOCATE. THREE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THREE LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WE URGE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO VOTE HI THANK YOU. HELLO AGAIN THAT WILL AT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF CALIFORNIA CONCORD ERIN CLIMATE POLLUTION. REALLY WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HEALTHIER MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THAT SERVES ALL RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA WILL SIMPLY NOT MEET OUR HEALTH PROTECTIVE CLEANER CLIMATE STANDARDS. LAND YOU CAN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING IS CENTRAL TO THE DISCUSSION WELL WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE HEALTHEQUITY CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THAT WERE CENTRAL TO AT THE THREE SEVENTY FIVE. SO WE'VE YOU AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN AS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ON SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE. I THINK YOU'RE THE BENEFIT THE HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS SPECIALLY THE CASE FOR OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE WHO ARE OFTEN DEALING WITH CHRONIC HEALTH BURDEN. DUE TO THE LACK OF HEALTHY TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND HIGH LEVEL OF CURRENT PATIENT POLLUTION. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WITH% SUPPORT- GETTING CALIFORNIA BACK ON TRACK AND BRINGING LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE AGENCIES TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING THE REGIONAL CLIMATE GOAL. AND TO ADD- AN MPA MPO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TARGET ACTION PLAN THAT WOULD IDENTIFY KEY BARRIER. AREAS OF INVESTMENT THAT EITHER SUPPORT OR DETRACTING FROM ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS- OUTRAGE TO AND IN AND VERY IMPORTANTLY REPORT THE INPUT FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES INTO THAT PLAN. AND THEN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT THE NPOS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ON TWENTY THIRTY FIVE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE. CRITICAL COMPONENT- IN ADDITION THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE NPOS TO SUBMIT DATA TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD THAT WOULD REALLY. SPELL OUT HOW TRANSPORTATION FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT. IN IN SUPPORT OF THE DISABLED COMMUNITY STRATEGY AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE CHANGES. ARE THOSE EXPENDITURES. ON CHANGES IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE AGAIN THE DISCUSSION OF HOW WE GET TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION- FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES- FOR THE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THAT WAS DESCRIBED. AND THAT CAN HELP TO SUPPORT ACTION NEEDED TO BE TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET AND- SECURE THOSE LOCAL HEALTH BENEFIT THAT WE KNOW ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION. OFF THE BOARD THE STATE REALLY MONTH ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT IN LINE WITH THE CHEATING. HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN SETTING UP FURTHER OF COURSE. AS THE WITNESS FROM NRDC NOTED- SO FINALLY JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE- ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUE CONVERSATION ON THAT NOW WE ARE DRIVE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU- WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS THAT IN BETWEEN. FROM BILL HEY. I DO NOT THE BILL HIGGINS ON THE PHONE LINES AT THIS TIME BUT IF HE IS ON YOU CAN START ZERO AND I CAN OPEN HIS LINE. STARTED. ZERO I DO NOT SEE HIM OKAY OF THE- OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND- TAKE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF OR OPPOSITION I'M JUST THEIR NAME WITNESSES SHOULD JUST STATE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND IF YOU AREN'T SUPPORT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW. WE WILL BE A LINE OF SIXTY NINE. GIVE ME SIXTY NINE DROPPED ONE MOMENT. BORDERLINE OF FIFTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION VOTERS SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER THANKS. THANK YOU ECTO A LINE OF SEVENTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING- JULIE AROUND UP WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ONE MOMENT WE HAVE TO IN Q. WE JUST TO PROVIDE THEIR LINE NUMBER. AND WE'LL GO TO LINE OF THIS SIX LINE IS- OPEN. ONE SEVENTY ONE. YES I'M MORE IN THIS EDUARDO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND KIND OF WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT AND INTENT OF AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AN EXTRA LINE OF SIXTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. JERRY BUXTON THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT IN Q. THANK YOU HOW DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF LOOKING THROUGH THIS BILL LIKE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I HAVE WITH THAT ARE YOU KNOW IT'S ANOTHER PROGRAM. THAT HAS GREAT INTENTIONS. IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WHICH VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED ESPECIALLY IN A DISTRICT LIKE MINE- IS NOT- GONNA BE SOLVED WITH BIKE A BIKE TRAILS IT IS SIMPLY TOO WARM. OUT IN THOSE AREAS TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE PEOPLE RIDING THEIR BIKES TO THE EMPLOYMENT. BUT THE REAL UNDER THE GET THE REAL UNDERLYING PROBLEM IS THE EMPLOYMENT PART OF THAT- IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THEN EMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO BE- IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE. AND IN AREAS LIKE MINE. WE HAVE 62% OF THE PEOPLE COMMUTE TO ORANGE COUNTY OR SAN DIEGO OR LA. AND THE ENVIRONMENT TO BRING IN- JOB PRODUCERS THAT MEANS BUSINESSES CORPORATIONS THINGS LIKE THAT THEY CAN HELP PEOPLE SUSTAINED- BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A HOUSE IS SIMPLY NOT THERE. I AND IN FACT WE DON'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE HAVE A DISINCENTIVE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO AND I'M LESS WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES WITH WITH NOT HAVING THE JOB BASE THAT WE NEED IN THESE OTHER AREAS THAT ARE GROWING- WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SOLVE AND- I FEEL LIKE WE'RE PILING THINGS ON TO LOCAL AGENCIES TO KEEP DOING PLANNING. FOR THINGS THAT THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT. BECAUSE WE SIMPLY ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO GET INTO THE- IT GET PAST THE PART THAT IS REALLY BROKEN- SO IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT PILING ON LIKE THIS- YOU KNOW THE BIKE LANE CONCEPT I THINK CAN BE INCORPORATED IN A LOT OF THESE EXISTING LIKE THE METROPOLITAN AREAS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEY HAVE PLENTY OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE CONVERTED TO BIKING FIRST IN LINE INRASTRUCTURE. YOU DON'T NEED CAL TRANSGENDER ACTOR THE MONEY IN FROM. OUR ROAD- BILL. THE THEY NEEDED CAN TO DO OUT IN AREAS LIKE IN MY DISTRICT. SO THE PEOPLE CAN GET AROUND NOT JUST FROM FROM OUR AREA TO OUTLYING COUNTIES.TO GET TO GET TO WORK BUT JUST SO THEY CAN GET AROUND TOWN SO THEY CAN GET TO THE GROCERY STORE THEY CAN GET TO THE NEIGHBORING CITIES- SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS. A GREAT FRIEND TO THE LONG TERM FUTURE SOME DAY IF WE CAN TAKE CARE THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS FIRST. AND UNTIL I SEE THAT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET BEHIND THESE THESE ARE THE TYPE OF INITIATIVES THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- MISTER FLORIDA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SOMEONE OVER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I DO OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN AND I CONCERT IS REALLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS YOU AND I HAVE. TRAVELED A LOT OF THE DOWN THE STATE TOGETHER RECENTLY AND- IF WE LOOK AT THAT CALIFORNIA WE LOOK AT THE APPROACH OF THIS BILL IS TAKING. IT'S ONCE AGAIN IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY BROAD STROKE. AND COMING FROM OUR PARTICULAR AREA OF THE WORLD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I KNOW THE BILL STATES THAT MULTIPLE COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THESE PLANS. BUT EVEN THAT IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING BUT I DO JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION IN THE BILL LANGUAGE IT TALKS ABOUT. REQUIRING CALTRANS TO SUBMIT TO SEE- TO SEE THIS IS. WHY I'M FOURTEEN THAT PAGE FOUR OF MY OF THE ANALYSIS- BEFORE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALTRANS TO SUBMIT TO CTC A PROPOSAL FOR APPROVAL. PRESIDENTIAL ATP FUNDING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH BRANDED NETWORKS A BICYCLE HIGHWAYS. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH BICYCLE HIGHWAYS. BUT IT ONE OF IN THE SUBSECTION. IS SAYS RESTRICT THAT USED TO THAT NETWORK TO BICYCLISTS. ARE WE EVEN AT THIS POINT WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF VEHICLES RIGHT. INTO LOW EMISSION THINGS BICYCLES DOES THAT MEAN SCOOTERS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION WILL NOT BE ALLOWED ON THESE BICYCLE HIGHWAYS BECAUSE IN THE LANGUAGES THAT RESTRICTS USE OF THE NETWORK TO BICYCLISTS. SO I JUST BE CURIOUS ABOUT THE CASE WELL THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND LET ME SAY THAT. I KNOW THAT THE BICYCLE PIECE OF THIS SEEMS TO BE GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION BUT THE BILL IS NOT. ABOUT BIKE LANES THE BILL IS ABOUT PLANNING FOR JOBS FOR HOUSING FOR MAKING LAND USE DECISIONS THAT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THE BIKE PIECE IS A PART OF IT. BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STUFF IN HERE AND THREE SEVENTY FIVE SO I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT OF MY CLOSING. BUT IN TERMS OF THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST THAT PARTICULAR SECTION BUT WE CAN pRIGHT AND BY THE WAY BYE BYE K. WITH IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE BUILDING. NECESSARILY AN ELEVATED HIGHWAY IT MEANS TO HAVE NETWORKS TO CONNECT TO EACH OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE IN GLENDALE WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON A BIKE LANE THAT'S ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF IT DOESN'T YET CONNECT TO THE L. A. RIVER BIKE PATH IF YOU CONNECT THEM YOU NOW HAVE A BUY KILEY WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY COMMUTE. USING THIS SYSTEM A PROTECTED BIKE LANES BUT IF THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED. THEY BECOME SOMETHING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN USE FOR PRACTICAL REASONS OTHER THAN KIND OF HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF RECREATION. SO IT'S TRYING TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT TOGETHER SO THAT YOU'RE CONNECTING YOUR RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE WITH YOUR JOB CENTERS WE CAN CERTAINLY FINESSE THE LANGUAGE TO. MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHATEVER IS ALLOWABLE UNDER THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE ORDINANCES IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO RIDE AN E. BIKE. ON THE LANE MAYBE YOU CAN DO IT MAYBE THERE'S A REASON YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IT IN CERTAIN PLACES BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE THAT PRESCRIPTIVE OR RESTRICTIVE WERE TRYING TO LEAVE. IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ARE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNITIES TO FIND THEIR OWN WAY TO REDUCE GHG WITH IN THEIR OWN. WORLD IN A VERY SUBURBAN COMMUNITY FOR INSTANCE MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALLOWING. MORE THE FARMERS MARKET SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORES ON SATURDAY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A PLAN THAT REDUCES YOUR G. H. T. MAYBE YOU CHANGE YOUR ZONING TO ALLOW PIANO LESSONS IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD OR CHIROPRACTORS OR CORNER BODEGAS. THINGS THAT GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE OF MOVING AROUND THEIR COMMUNITY WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES THOSE ARE THE KIND I TO. THINGS THAT ARE ELLA. WITHIN PLAN TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE REDUCING. MILES TRAVELED. IS TO TRY TO MAKE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. NOT RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT BUDGETS MORE METROPOLITAN. SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES. FOR THEM TO LOOK AT THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE. LESS HOW DO WE BRING THOSE JOBS CLOSER TO HOUSING HOW DO WE ALLOW FOR MORE USES. REDUCE SPRAWL OR JUST FORCING PEOPLE TO ALWAYS DRIVE JUST TO GET A GALLON OF MILK. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS ABOUT. THAT'S WHY IT HAS TO BE BROUGHT IT HAS TO BE BROAD BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE BILL. YOU WANT TO GIVE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THE CHANCE TO INNOVATE. AND TO DO WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. BUT THE GOALS ARE THE SAME ACROSS THE STATE. FIND WAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE CHANCES OF MOVING AROUND THEIR COMMUNITY. IN WAYS OTHER THAN CARS WHETHER IT'S BY BIKES OR SCOOTERS. AND LOOK AT YOUR OWN LAND USE TO SEE HOW YOU'VE CREATED A BARRIER TO WALKABILITY. NOT TO GET TOO FAR OFF THE TOPIC I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE I HAVE TO WALK TWO MILES TO GET A GALLON OF MILK. WHY CAN'T THERE BE A CORNER BODEGA OR LITTLE GROCERY STORE ALLOW ON THE MAIN DRAG IN MY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD. MY CITY DOESN'T ALLOW IT. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF INTROSPECTIVE. OF SELF LOOKING WE WANT OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE THINKING ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY IT IS BROAD AND GOAL ORIENTED RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTIVE AND WILL LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE BIKE HIGHWAYS FOR SURE. BE SURE YOU BRING THAT UP TO MEXICO AND I DIDN'T CATCH THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR REASON I DO AND WHO HAS YOUR RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ON- IN ONE OF MY IN LARGER CITIES OF MY DISTRICT THEY DID THEY CREATED A BIKE LANE BETWEEN A JUNIOR COLLEGE. AND WE WANT CAMPUS AND ANOTHER. NOBODY USES IT. BUT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT SO IT HAD TO BE DONE. AND LITERALLY NOBODY USES IT BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT THAT CONNECTS WITH NOTHING. I MEAN THIS TO JUNIOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. BUT PEOPLE DRIVE THEY DON'T USE IT. SO IS GORGEOUS- ESSENTIALLY WASTE OF MONEY FOR A LOT OF WAYS AND NOW IT'S KIND OF BEEN DOING LIKE THE HOMELESS HIGHWAY THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU SEE IT. ON IT IS HOMES PEOPLE PUSHING A CART AROUND. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE I'M ASSUMING SO. IF THERE IS A METHOD OR AND AN IDEA THAT WE CAN ALLOW FOR LOCAL CONTROL. TO ALLOW THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STATE TO STATE. TO PUT A MANDATE OR REQUIREMENT ON THE WE HAVE TO DO THIS. THEN WE JUST DO STUPID PROJECTS JUST TO CHECK A BOX RIGHT SO EXPECT TO JUST REMEMBER THAT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT DOESN'T SPECIFY ANY TYPE OF PROJECT THAT THE CITY HAS TO DO. IT SAYS USE YOUR OWN PLANNING YOU MUST PLAN TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. SO WE'RE NOT FORCING THEM TO DO ANY PARTICULAR. KIND OF PROJECT WE THEY ALL HAVE THEIR CARDS THEY ALL HAVE THEIR- THEIR COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS THEY ALL HAVE THEIR REGIONAL. NETWORKS ALL WE'RE SAYING IS WHEN YOU MAKE-YOUR PLANS. NTERNALLY AND REGIONALLY. YOU MUST FIND WAYS TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IF THIS. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT PARTICULAR PLAN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE DATA SHOW WOULD ACTUALLY. BE USEFUL THAT'S NOT ON THE STATE WITH OUR GOALS THAT'S ON THEM AND THEIR OWN INTERNAL PLANNING. OR MAYBE MISSED JUDGING OR MAY AB THERE SOME OTHER VERY MAYBE IT IS. THE HOMELESS. PEOPLE ARE. NOT TO USE THE TRAIL I DON'T KNOW I HAVE NO I. THERE'S A LOT YOU KNOW BUT- BUT WE'RE JUST SAYING TO CITIES WHEN YOU PLAN. PLAN IN A WAY THAT GIVES PEOPLE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF THEIR CARS WHATEVER WE WILL WORK FOR YOUR COMMUNITY IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT WHEREVER YOU ARE. NOT I PRESUME WE CAN HAVE THIS ARMENIA TAKE MUCH MORE BUT I APPRECIATE THE AYE LOOK I LOVE THE DIALOGUE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST SAID YOU KNOW I AGAIN WOULD APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONNECT. OUR LAND USE PLANNING. WITH OUR GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOLS.

PLATE WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE GO AHEAD AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR EXCELLENT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. GLOBALLY THE E. COMMERCE INDUSTRY USES NEARLY TWO POINT ONE BILLION WITH A B. POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING OF THE THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY USE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND OF THAT E. COMMERCE BUSINESSES IN THE U. S. GENERATED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING WASTE. LAST YEAR CONSUMERS SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS ONLINE WITH U. S. MERCHANTS UP 44% OVER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION NOW BUYING ONLINE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING GENERATED IS ESTIMATED TO DOUBLE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS STAGGERING GROWTH EXPECTED TO OUTLAST THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS CREATING A WAVE OF SINGLE USE PACKAGES AND PACKAGING ALMOST ALWAYS HEADED FOR LANDFILL IF WE'RE LUCKY A LOT OF IT GETS INCINERATED OR ENDS UP POLLUTING OUR WATERWAYS AND OUR OCEANS. THIS PACKAGING IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY NON RECYCLABLE AS AN ONLINE RETAIL CONSUMER MYSELF AS MOST OF US ARE I'M APPALLED AT THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC THAT COMES WITH ITEMS YOU KNOW EVEN ITEMS THAT DON'T NEED PLASTIC PACKAGING AND OF GETTING WRAPPED IN GOBS OF PLASTIC. VERY OFTEN. AND I HEAR THIS FROM MY- RESIDENTS OF MY CITY ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S RECYCLABLE AND THEY PUT IN THEIR CURBSIDE RECYCLING BIN AND IT'S NOT CURBSIDE RECYCLABLE AND ANYWHERE THAT I KNOW OF AND IT BECOMES CONTAMINATION THAT LITERALLY HAS TO BE SCOOPED OUT OF ECYCLED MACHINES ON THE HOUR IT'S REALLY REALLY A PROBLEM AND- IT'S PRETTY UNCONSCIONABLE ESPECIALLY SINCE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. THAT MUCH OF THE INDUSTRY IS SHIFTING TO- THAT ALREADY EXIST AND THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE IN FACT ALTERNATIVE PACKAGING LIKE LIME LUPIN MUSHROOM MUSHROOM PACKAGING MADE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE WILL REDUCE THE UNNECESSARY AND UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC PLASTIC USED AN E. COMMERCE MARKETPLACE BY PHASING IT OUT OVER TIME AND BY SENDING THAT MARKET SIGNAL TO PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP AND INNOVATE THESE PRODUCTS. BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE AN EVEN HUGER AND GROWING MARKET FOR IT GIVING THE RETAILERS TIME TO SHIFT OVER AS YOU KNOW WITH THE NEED TO SHIFT OVER CONTINUING THE WORK THAT MANY OF THEM SUCH AS AMAZON ALREADY DOING WITH SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING THIS IS LOW HANGING FRUIT MEMBERS AND SOMETHING THAT IS. REALLY REALLY A SCOURGE SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL TODAY I WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY ARE ACTUALLY TRIGGER WITH OCEANIA THE SPONSORED AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND LAUREN COLUMN THE POLICYADVOCATE WITH SIERRA CLUB. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE ALLOW THE WITNESSES TO COLIN. GIVE THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ASHLEY DRINKER AND I AM THE PACIFIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER FOR THE OCEAN CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION OCEANA ON BEHALF OF OUR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OCEANIC PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF UNNECESSARY SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING. USED FOR SHIPMENT SENT DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FROM ONLINE RETAIL PURCHASES. OR E-COMMERCE. LAKE SUPPORT EFFORTS LIKE AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE A SURVEY CONDUCTED LAST SUMMER REVEALED THAT 85% OF AN OF AMAZON CUSTOMERS IN THE U. S. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION. AND 71% WITH NEW PLASTIC FREE ALTERNATIVE PACKAGING OFFERED. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO SINGLE USE PLASTICS. AND FIRE FROM PACKAGING ARE AVAILABLE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY AMAZON INDIA ANNOUNCED IT HAD ACHIEVED A AWAY FROM SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THEIR DECLARATIONS ACT. AMAZON HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A CURBSIDE RECYCLABLE PADDED PAPER MILLER BEING USED IN THE U. S. PROCESS THE ORDER. THE GLOBAL ECOMMERCE LEADERS PRIOR AND CURRENT ACTION TO ADDRESS IT SINGLE USE PLASTICS PROBLEM DEMONSTRATES WHAT IS POSSIBLE WHEN PLASTIC REDUCTION AND THE PRIORITY. ADDITIONALLY IF THERE ARE U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO PRODUCE ALTERNATIVE TO SINGLE SIX HUNDRED AT THE PLASTIC CUSHIONING AND VOID FILL THAT PROTECTED DURING SHIPMENT AND THE ALTERNATIVE CAN AND SHOULD BE USED MORE WIDELY. CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD OUT OF THE WORLD WIDE E. COMMERCE CONTINUES TO INCREASE IN VOLUME IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE PACKAGES SENT IN AND INTO THE STATE A PACKAGE AS THE STATE EMPLOYEE AND RESPONSIBLY AS POSSIBLE. WITHOUT BOLD ACTION THE PLASTICS CRISIS AND SUBSEQUENT HARMFUL IMPACTS WILL ONLY WORSEN. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE CHANGES TO THE WAY WE USE PLASTICS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED IN THE CONNECTED TO DOUBLE AND THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE NEW MOTHER ANNA CALIFORNIANS I FEEL STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TACKLE THIS PRESSING ISSUE. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR LEADING AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR CO AUTHORING. EIGHTY THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE WE URGE AND I ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. I THINK YOU'RE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SPHERICAL CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING HALF A MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS STATE AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE WILL HELP ADDRESS THE GLOBAL PLASTICS CRISIS BY PHASING OUT THE UNNECESSARY AND UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC USED TO SHIP ONLINE PURCHASES IN INTO CALIFORNIA. THIRTY THREE BILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC INTO THE WORLD'S MARINE ENVIRONMENT EVERY DEVASTATING OUR SHARED OCEAN AND COASTAL ECOSYSTEM NOT CLASSIC COULD NOT GO AWAY HE SAID IT BREAKS UP INTO SMALLER PIECES BUT THEN STARBIRD CHOKE WILDLIFE CLASSICS PROGRESS YOU CAN HELP ON OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND CALIFORNIANS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE CYCLE AND COST CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT. FROM ENTERING OUR OCEANS AND WATERWAYS. WHAT'S THE MAILING ENVELOPE AIR COOLERS PROBLEM. AND EXPAND POLICY INCLUDING READ SPELL COME REFERRED TO AS PART INCLUDES. AND MOBILE PHONE ADDED TO ONLINE BECAUSE DURING SHIPMENT SUBSTANTIAL COULD. TO THE CRISIS. BOB HI FOR PLASTIC. USES MARKET MAY FROM THE OF THE CLASS FOR GENERATIONS ALMOST ALL THE PACKAGES FISCAL IMMEDIATELY OUT CRAPPIE OPEN. AND NEED TO RE USED NOR CARGO. I THINK IT BECOMES LAND. BURNED OR INTEREST ON MEANS PUT AT THE PUMP GENERAL. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY ONE EVEN. URGENT THEY'LL INTO ADDRESSING THAT. WAY STREAMS WE IS A MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR LEADERS AND- YOUR EYES THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT HAVE TO WAIT A OFFICE. OF MODERATOR KEEP ALLOW. TO SPEAK. THANK YOU THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD MORNING MELANIE MATTER AND MEMBERS. SORRY ADAM GO HEAD. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AUTOMATICALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION I WANNA BEGIN BY PROVIDING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WANTED COMPREHENSIVE RECYCLING POLLUTION AND TO THAT END OF THE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR YEARS NOW AN IMPLEMENTABLE THICK THAT I CREATE ROBOT AND MARKET. HOLD BUSINESSES ACCOUNTABLE DESIGN FOR RECYCLABILITY INCENTIVIZE SOURCE REDUCTION AND PROVIDE FUNDING AND A PATHWAY TO BRING MUCH NEEDED RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE ONLINE IN CALIFORNIA. A LOT OF ONE TEN OF EIGHTY THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE DIFFERENT OUR NAPA ENVIRONMENT. WE BELIEVE THE BILL MISSES THE MARK AT PROVIDING MEANINGFUL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS EXCEPT WEIGHT. REDUCING POLLUTION IN OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. ALL GOALS WHICH CALCHAMBER AND ITS COALITION PARTNER SHARE WITH THE AUTHOR. BUT BY PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE PACKING STATE WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OR LOOKING AT THE FULL LIFE CYCLE IMPACT WILL BE MATERIAL. THE BILL AND ARGUE ARBITRARILY BANNED MATERIALS FOR BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT MANY CASES HAVE NO COMPATIBLE SUBSTITUTE. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL LEAD TO GREATER NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EXTERNALITIES AND SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN. NUMEROUS LIFE CYCLE ANALYSES SHOW THE VERY PACKAGING MATERIALS BANNED BY THIS BILL ACTUALLY HAVE LOWER NET CARBON EMISSIONS. LOWER FOSSIL FUEL UAGE LOWER WATER USAGE WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER PACKAGE FORMATS. THE PACKAGING SERVICE SEVERAL CRITICAL FUNCTIONS IN OUR MODERN ECONOMY THAT THE BILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE. I'M SHOULD BE TELEVISION MONITORS LARGE APPLIANCES TO INSURANCE FRUITS VEGETABLES AND RAW MEAT PRODUCTS ALL PHYSICALLY ARRIVE. THESE MATERIALS BANNED UNDER THIS BILL PLAYED CENTRAL ROLES ENSURING THAT THE FACT THAT COULD ARRIVE SAFELY AND THAT THE FOOD SHELF LIFE IS PROLONGED TO AVOID EXCESS WEIGHT AND CARBON EMISSIONS. TO THAT END WE BELIEVE THE BILL IS ACTUALLY INCONGRUENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS ACROSS ALL SECTORS. CALCHAMBER MEMBERS ARE CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO OPTIMIZE SHIPPING REDUCE COSTS. AND REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ON A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO INCREASING RECYCLING OF PACKAGING MATERIALS. WHILE ALSO ENSURING NEED GOOD MOVE EFFICIENTLY AND SAFELY. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DANTE. WITH MCCUE K. UNITS ON THE TO CAL MANY. AND TECHNOLOGY IF IT. ALSO RESPECT OPPOSITION TO AB. THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. C. M. CANIS MEMBERS THAT INCREASED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE PACKAGING MATERIAL IS RECYCLABLE AND APPROPRIATELY RECOVERED AND RECYCLED. TO THAT END SEEMED UNITS MEMBERS AND SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR COLLEAGUE ORGANIZATIONS. DEVELOPING A WORKABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING MATERIALS AS WELL AS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND PROVIDE YOU DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR RECYCLED MATERIALS. IMPROVED PACKAGING DESIGNED TO INCREASE RECYCLABILITY CAN DEVELOP VALUES YOU FINANCING FOR COLLECTING AND SORTING VARIOUS PACKAGING FORMAT. WEALTHY IMPAIR PRESHEAF THE INTENT OF AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE CM BELIEVES THAT THE COURT SUPPLEMENT TO PAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NECESSARY BOLD PACKAGING PLAYS IN SHIPPING AND PROTECTING PRODUCTS. ADOPTED THE MULTITUDE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS RECYCLABILITY WASTE PREVENTION MATERIALIZATION THE ANDY GRIFFITH HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS RELATED TO THE VARIOUS PACKAGING MATERIALS. AND ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE OF OUR MENTALLY WHILE PROVIDING THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND BROADER SUPPLY CHAIN. WITH PRACTICAL AND IMPLEMENTABLE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THE RECORDING REQUIREMENTS UNFORTUNATELY AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE INCLUDES BANDS ON SOME PACKAGING MATERIALS USED FOR SHIPPING THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND IN FACT COULD VERY WELL LEAD TO INCREASED WASTE AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT BREAKAGE FOR SPOILAGE CHAMPAGNAT MEMBERS UNDERSTANDABLE THEY NEED TO TWENTY INCREASING RECOVERING PRODUCTION AND RECYCLING OF YOU SINGLE USE PACKAGING WASTE PUT INTO THE MARKETPLACE. TO THAT END GMG WILL WORK TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IAN LEGISLATURE CRAFT AN APPROACH THAT IS WORKABLE AND IMPLEMENTABLE TO ADDRESS THESE GOALS RATHER THAN THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL PROHIBITION UNDER AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. THAT IS LIKELY TO INCREASE WASTE AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE AND USE SUCH PACKAGING. FOR THESE REASONS THE CMJ MUST RESPECTFULLY REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND UNFORTUNATELY. MUCH RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE WILL OPEN THE UP TO WITNESSES ON THE LINE. AND SOME OR A- THANK YOU YOU ARE SUPPORT OR THE OF AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE YOU MY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO NOW.

OUR PLANET EARTH IS THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPLETELY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MANUFACTURER. OF RECYCLED P. E. T. ALSO KNOWN AS OUR PACK PACKAGING AND OTHER PRODUCTS- DERIVED FROM POST CONSUMER PET CONTAINERS LOAD BOTTLED THEM FROM A FORMS. RECYCLED UP WAKE FORM A CONVERT INTO NEW PRODUCTS INCLUDING THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS AND OUR THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT FACILITY LOCATED IN BURNING CALIFORNIA. GEN SEEMS HIGHER MANNER MANUFACTURE PROCESS OCCURS UNDER SINGLE WORD. IN THE HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS ARE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD. DON'T WANT CONTAINERS ARE USED IN MANY APPLICATIONS OTHER THAN PACKAGING FOR FRESH PRODUCE. IN STORES THERE USE THAT DALY COUNTERS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS SANDWICHES. PACKAGED ITEMS SUCH AS NUTS AND DRIED FRUITS. GUACAMOLE HUMMUS SALSA AND IN MANY OTHER PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION RESTAURANT USEFUL FORMS FOR TAKEAWAY FOOD. OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS DRINKING CUPS ARE WIDELY USED IN HIGH VOLUME APPLICATIONS AT EATING AND DRINKING ESTABLISHMENTS SPORTING EVENTS SO OF AND ANY PARTY. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF POST CONSUMER PET NORMAL FORM- CONTAINERS DISCARDED IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. AND ONE OTHER PLASTIC THAT YOU'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SUCH AS POLYPROPYLENE THAT NUMBER IS LIKELY CLOSER TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS PER YEAR AND GROWING. AT THE SAME TIME THE RECYCLED PLASTIC MARKET FACES MULTIPLE CRITICAL CHALLENGES. DROPS IN OIL PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN A LOW COST VIRGIN PLASTICS. REDUCING INCENTIVES FOR MANUFACTURERS TO USE RECYCLED PLASTIC. AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL COVER MOST THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS USED FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGES. INCLUDING ITEMS SUCH AS PRODUCE AND VERY CLAM SHELL CONTAINERS SANDWICH CONTAINERS YOUR CUP COFFEE PODS- ON TAKEOUT CONTAINERS AND CURRENTLY TOPS.

PRODUCE PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SET THE PACE FOR THE REST OF THE NATION AS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER AND EXPORTER. THERMOFORM PACKAGING SUCH AS CLAM SHELLS HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO TRANSPORT THEIR FRESH PRODUCE TO CONSUMERS NATIONWIDE. THIS TYPE OF PACKAGING HELPS EXTEND PRODUCT LIFE AND PROTECT THE PRUDE PRODUCE FROM DAMAGING CONTAMINATION AND IT REDUCES FOOD WASTE. PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING MADE WITH POST CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT ARE INCREASINGLY A GLOBAL PRIORITY FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER BRANDS AND RETAILERS. OUR COMPANY OBJECTIVE IS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO HAVE TO BE RECYCLABLE OR REUSABLE OUR COMPANY HAS MADE FIRM COMMITMENTS TO USE RECYCLED P. E. T. THERMOFORMED AND OUR PRODUCTS. PREVIOUSLY MOST RECYCLED P. E. T. HAS COME FROM PLASTIC BOTTLES WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY IN HIGH DEMAND ESPECIALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH SETS MINIMUM CONTENT I'M PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WE ARE PLEASED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY TO MAKE THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS FROM THERMAL FOR MATERIALS WHICH IS NOT AN EASY FEAT. HOWEVER WE ARE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT CURRENTLY COLLECTING THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS I NOTS TO SUPPORT ADEQUATE RECYCLING RATES IN SUPPLY. WE ARE IN SCHOOL SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE PACKAGING THAT WE USE NEEDS OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS YOU COULD RECYCLE CONTENT MANDATE. THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN RECYCLABLE PRODUCT THAT ALSO HAS RECYCLED CONTENT AND THIS BILL WILL PROPEL THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN TOWARD MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PACKAGING. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM FOR CARRYING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

OKAY MISTER SEATTLE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KING FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING EMISSIONS AND AMENDMENTS AND THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE YES AND I WAS CURIOUS IF THE ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS MIGHT OFFER- CAL RECYCLE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY I TO ADJUST THE GOAL AS YOU HAD IN AB SEVEN NINETY THREE. NO I DON'T- HAVE. THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING SO LET ME GET BACK TO ENOUGH AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE A IN DEALING WITH- MANY OF THE OTHER MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN IN REGARDS TO RECYCLING WHICH I THINK MOST MOST PEOPLE SUPPORT RECYCLING. WHEN THE AND GAME CAN'T BE ACHIEVED. BUT WE'RE STILL RAMMING THINGS DOWN THE THROATS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ALSO THE WASTE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO. TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT JUST CAN'T BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE YET- CAL RECYCLED HANS IT CONSISTENTLY- REFERS BACK TO THE FACT THAT DOUBLES WE HAVE NO FLEXIBILITY. AND SO THAT DID IT TO ME I THINK THESE THINGS NEED TO HAVE THAT IN AND SO. I'LL I'LL YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE CAN. I I'M I'M GONNA COME FROM THE NO I STAFF IS. WATCHING SAW WAIT TO SEE IF I GET A TEXT IF WE CAN GET THAT FLEXIBILITY TO GO A LONG WAYS TOWARDS. YOU KNOW. PROBABLY LEAVE ANY ANY OF THOSE THOSE TYPE OF CONCERNS FROM ME. R.

EXCEL CONTAINERS OR FRUIT THEY PUT HIM IN THE BLUE THEN GO TO SOME MAGIC PLACE. AND IT'S GONNA RECYCLE THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- AB NINE CODIFIES THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM OR THE R. F. R. F. F. C. PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION. THE PROGRAM JUST RECEIVED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND EARLY ACTION BUDGET BUT EARLY BUDGET ACTION FOR WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS IT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR YESTERDAY. CALIFORNIA HAS A NUMBER OF GRANT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE- STATE GOVERNMENT- THAT PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR FIRE PREPAREDNESS PROJECTS UNFORTUNATELY NEARLY ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE COMPETITIVE GRANTS WHICH TYPICALLY DON'T PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROJECT PLANNING OR DEVELOPMENT. AS A RESULT WE FUND PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY BUT MAY NOT BE THE MOST PRETTY JACK WERE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR COMMUNITY AND FIRE AND RESOURCE FIRE PROTECTION. THE R. F. F. C. PROGRAM IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANTS TO REGIONAL ENTITIES THAT WILL CREATE A REGIONAL PLAN AND DEVELOP A PIPELINE OF FIRE PREPAREDNESS PROJECTS AND MEET THAT MEETS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE REGION. ONCE DEVELOP THE PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE WILL BE WELL POSITIONED TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR FUNDING FROM THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATED BY CAL FIRE CAL- YES AND OTHERS THIS IS A WIN WIN. REGIONAL ENTITIES RECEIVE SCARCE RESOURCES FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND THE STATE GETS A OF THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC SET OF PROJECTS THAT ARE TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF EACH REGION. AB NINE ENSURES THE PROGRAM COVERS ALL REGIONS THAT HAVE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES AND EXPANDS THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS WORK SUCH AS HOME HARDENING IN THE CREATION OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT- KAREN BERGER WITH THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND KAREN GAFFNEY WITH THE NORTH COAST RESOURCE PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU A MODERATOR. CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINES FOR THE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU THEIR LINES ARE OPEN. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR I AM KAREN BERGER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT ARE TO EITHER A KEY COMPONENT IN ADDRESSING THE STATE'S WILDFIRE CRISIS. OUR UNIQUE POSITIONING CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC ENABLE US TO HAVE DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LANDOWNERS AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE LOCALLY APPROPRIATE PROJECT REGARDING FOREST AND WATERSHED HEALTH WHILE ALSO MEETING THE HOMEOWNERS TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ON HOME GARDENING. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING OUR CITY THAT HAVING THE CAPACITY TO PLAN AND DESIGN GOOD PROJECT. PARTICULARLY TAKING THE TIME TO ENGAGE PARTNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO CREATE A PIPELINE OF GOOD PROJECT. AND WE KNOW THE SAME CAPACITY CHALLENGES EXIST FOR OUR NONPROFIT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TRIBAL COLLEAGUE. WITHOUT GOOD PROJECT DESIGNED IN COLLABORATION OUR WORK IS LESS EFFECTIVE SILOS AND REDUNDANT. THAT IS WHY WE'RE IN SUCH STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NINE AND THE REGIONAL POOREST EMPIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. BY FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO INCREASE CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL SCALE TO DRIVE COLLABORATION AND IDENTIFY PLAN AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE PROJECT THE INCREASE WILDFIRE RESILIENCY. IT'S REALLY HELPFUL THAT ARE AT THAT FIFTY DOES NOT FORCE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO HOW OUR REGION OF THE FINE. OR WHO SERVES AS THE HUB FOR THE REGION IT ALLOWS EACH REGION TO ADDRESS ITS UNIQUE CHALLENGES WITH ITS UNIQUE PLAYERS. FROM OUR EXPERIENCE THIS PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. BY RTT MEMBERS ARE RECIPIENTS OF OUR FFE FUND AT THE FUNDING. INLAND EMPIRE AND SAN DIEGO ARE TEDIOUS AND SERVICE THE REGIONAL ENTITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING AND REGION AT THE REGIONAL PLANS TO PRIORITIZE THE PROJECTS IN THEIR AREA. IN ADDITION MANY RCTS AND PA ARCADY ARE SUB GRANTEES WORKING TOGETHER WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS SUCH AS THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND THE FEAR IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY TO HELP THOSE CONSERVATIVE DEVELOP THEIR REGIONAL PLAN. WE APPRECIATE AND VALUE THE UNIQUE WORK. WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE SPENDING. THE RSS HAS THAT A CRITICAL NEED IN THE FACE APPROACH TO CREATING GREATER WHILE BY OUR HIGHER RESILIENCY. INVESTING IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A PIPELINE OF ATTRACTIVE PROJECT. THEY CAN THEN LEVERAGE FUNDING AND SUPPORT FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES. RSS FC'S REGION BY REGION APPROACH AND FOCUS ON CAPACITY IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION TO WILDFIRE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB NINE AND ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE I'VE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE THAT.

NINE ZERO EIGHT NINE ZERO THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN. HI THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THIS. THANK YOU BOTH. THIS COMMITTEE IS MORE THAN FAMILIAR WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT HAVE LED TO THE CLOSURE RECYCLING CENTERS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO I'LL SPARE YOU RECOUNTING THOSE DETAILS AS YOU KNOW THE LACK OF ACCESS TO REDEMPTION OPTIONS HAS BECOME PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN RURAL AREAS AND THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE THINGS EVEN WORSE MUCH OF THE MODERN RECYCLING MOVEMENT CAN TRACE ITS ROOTS BACK TO HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND THE CITY OF ARCADIA IN MY DISTRICT FOR DECADES LEADERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE LED THE WAY. TRAGICALLY AS IT STANDS TODAY IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR RESIDENTS IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY TO REDEEM THEIR CRB CONTAINERS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE ONLY THREE REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT SERVE THE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILE COUNTY. LIKE MANY BUSINESS. OWNERS AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE THOSE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE DURING THE MANDATORY SHUT DOWN ORDER. WHEN THE SHUTDOWN ORDER WAS LIFTED ONLY ONE REDEMPTION CENTER REMAIN TO SERVE BECAUSE CONSUMERS IN THE COUNTY. AND THE PENT UP DEMAND WAS TRULY AMAZING. THE LINES AND CROWDS OF FORM CAUSE TRAFFIC JAMS IT BACKED UP ON THE HIGHWAY CREATED A PUBLIC SAFETY SITUATION SO SEVERE THAT COUNTY OFFICIALS WERE FORCED TO CLOSE THE CENTER. AS A RESULT THERE ARE NOW ZERO REDEMPTION CENTERS IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. TODAY A RESIDENT OF ARCADIA. WHO WANTS TO REDEEM THEIR CRB CONTAINERS WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE EITHER ONE. AND A HALF HOURS EACH WAY TO CRESCENT CITY AND THAT'S ASSUMING THE HIGHWAYS OPEN BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CLOSED A LOT THIS YEAR. OR TWO AND A HALF HOURS EACH WAY. TO WILLITS IN THE SOUTH. WE HAVE WORKED WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY A HANDFUL OF SMALL CHANGES THAT WOULD ALLOW RECYCLING CENTERS TO RE OPEN. IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AS A RESULT THE BILL DOES FOUR THINGS. THAT AUTHORIZES CALVET RECYCLE TO ALLOW CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS OPERATE ON AN ALTERNATIVE SCHEDULE IF IT IS BEST SERVES THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THE GOALS OF THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. NUMBER TWO IT REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP A PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW RECYCLING CENTERS TO APPLY FOR AUTHORIZATION TO OPERATE BY APPOINTMENT. THREE IT EXEMPTS DEALERS DELIVERING EMPTY BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO A RECYCLING CENTER PROCESSOR FROM THE DAILY LOAD LIMITS. AND FOR IT AUTHORIZES BAG DROP RECYCLING CENTERS AND SETS A THREE DAY STANDARD FOR PAYMENT OF C. R. V. THESE MODEST CHANGES WILL BY NO MEANS SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS FACING THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. THESE DAYS BUT THE ADDRESS A CRISIS IN MY DISTRICT AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HELP OTHER COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING WITH ACCESS TO REDEMPTION CENTERS TO. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC. THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I SUPPORT. THE RIGHT VOTE.

GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS BONNIE BUT- IF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF ONE OH SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI MY NAME IS JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC- STAR AND THAT THE OPPORTUNITY EARLIER WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN WE CAN'T IN THE COMMON SENSE AFTER FOR BY POWER CYCLE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED TO TAILOR THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAMS TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS TO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES- AS MR WOODS SAID WITH A CLOSER SO MANY CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS. THAT CONVENIENT BEVERAGE CONTAINER REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES DON'T EXIST IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS WE HAVE THREE COUNTIES WITH NO RECYCLING CENTERS SEVEN WITH A SINGLE RECYCLING CENTER AND SIX THAT HAVE ONLY TWO RECYCLING CENTERS. SO WITHOUT CONVENIENT REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES THE PROGRAM CAN EASILY BECOME A REGRESSIVE TAX WE THINK THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY TO PROVIDING SOME COMMONSENSE RELIEF AS I SAID AND MAKING IT EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO GET THEIR CRP PAYMENTS BACK THANK YOU MR WOOD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU MEXICO TO LINE OF ONE TWELVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. JEFF DONLEVY WITH MINGS RECYCLING AND MING'S RESOURCES IN HAYWARD- WE SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE IT AS AN URGENCY BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

BEACON CONDUCTS COASTAL ROAD AND STUDIES AND RESTORATION PROJECTS WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION IN COORDINATION WITH PARKS PLANNING AND PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENTS OF ITS MEMBER AGENCIES. TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION. BEACON WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE CITY OF VENTURA IN THE FAIRGROUNDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SURFERS POINT PROJECT TO RESTORE THE COASTLINE. BETWEEN THE VENTURA PIER AND THE VENTURA RIVER ESTUARY. IT HAS SERVED AS A NATIONAL MODEL. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BEACON RELEASED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THE SANTA BARBARA TURK COAST CREATED TO DATE. AND THEIR PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT P. E. I. R. SERVES AS THEIR RESILIENCY ROAD. TO POINT CONCEPTION TO POINT A GROUP. AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX PROMOTES THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN BOTH RESILIENCY ADOPTION PLANNING BY ESTABLISHING BEACON AS A PROGRAM WITHIN THE STATE. COASTAL CONSERVANCY. IT WOULD ALLOW BEACON TO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM BOND AND GRANT FUNDS AND FURTHER ENSURE THAT THEIR WORK ON THE CENTRAL COAST CONTINUES.

REGIONAL SENTIMENT MANAGEMENT IS MANAGED IN THE STATE BY VARIOUS REGIONAL AGENCIES AND COLLABORATIVE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP THAT ALSO INCLUDES SPEAK IT BECOMES MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY MILE COASTLINE COVERING SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTY IS THE STATE'S LARGEST COASTAL LIBERALS STYLE. SANTA BARBARA LITERAL SELL A LITTLE TELLS THE DISTINCT AREA THE COAST OR SAND ENTERS THE OCEAN FLOWS DOWN THE COAST. AND THEN IS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM. EIGHT TO REACH SERVICE MANAGER INCLUDE AND- FUNDING FOR REGIONAL SEVEN MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION IS INADEQUATE EPISODIC IN INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE INCREASING NEED. WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT REGIONAL SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT PROJECTS WITH ONLY LOCAL RESOURCES WE NEED A STRONGER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON COASTAL ACCESS AND LOSS OF COASTAL HABITAT THAT IS OCCURRING FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. AB EIGHT TWENTY SIX WOULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE STRONGER STATE SUPPORT TO REGIONAL SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND FUNDING SUPPORT.

AS DESCRIBED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THIS MEASURE WOULD ESTABLISH THE LONG STANDING BEACON PROGRAM AS A PROGRAM UNDER THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WOULD BUILD ON THE GREAT SUCCESSES ACHIEVED BY THE THIRTY FIVE YEARJOINT EFFORT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY SANTA BARBARA. AND MANY OF OUR CITIES ALONG THE SOUTH CENTRAL COAST. ESTABLISHING BEACON AS A PROGRAM UNDER THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WILL ENHANCE ACCESS TO GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AND PROMOTE GREATER COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION AMONG AND BETWEEN PARTICIPATING AGENCIES AND THE STATE. INTERNEES BENEFITS WOULD HELP YOU CAN DEVOTE MORE OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES.

MATHIS MATHIS NO MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MURATSUCHI THEY ARE CHAU SAY OUR JOURNAL STONE. STONE I WOULD WOOD I. SIX TWO. SIX TO THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE WHICH PROPOSES THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT WILL ENCOURAGE ROBUST ECOLOGICALLY AND REGIONALLYAPPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS IN FIRE RESILIENCE ANDRISK MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT WILL MAKE. THAT WILL BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S FIRE RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANKS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE CALIFORNIA'S FIRE REGIMES ARE CHANGING DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT STRESSORS. THE OF THESE FIRE THREATS IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES INCLUDING WATER QUALITY SPECIAL HABITATS IN OUR PUBLIC LANDS. FIRES ARE BECOMING MORE SEVERE AND DESTRUCTIVE AS WE ALL KNOW. FIVE OF THE TOP TWENTY LARGEST CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES OCCURRED IN TWENTY TWENTY. THERE WERE OVER NINETY FOUR HUNDRED FIRES LAST YEAR. EARNING FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES AND THAT SADLY- WE HAVE THE LOSS OF FOR THIRTY THREE LIVES LAST YEAR THE FIRES INCLUDED THE LARGEST FIRE ON RECORD THE AUGUST COMPLEX FIRE. INCREASE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO HELP ECOLOGICALLY MANAGE OUR FORCE FOR AWHILE FOR RESILIENCE AND FORCED HEALTH. WHICH IS A CRITICAL ACCIDENT MUST CONTINUE AT A GREATER PACE AND SCALE. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE ALSO SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE THREATS OF WILDFIRES IMPACTING COMMUNITIES AND NON FORESTED HABITATS. MUCH OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IS FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE RESPONSE AND SUPPRESSION WHICH WE UNDERSTAND UGH THAT TO NEEDS TO BE IN FACT THAT LAST YEAR WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE. A WIND UP COSTING ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. WHILE WILL ALWAYS LIKELY HAVE TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR THAT SUPPRESSION A RESPONSE WE NEED TO MAKE GREATER INVESTMENTS IN RISK REDUCTION AND RESILIENCE STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES THAT CAN HELP REDUCE THE CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS AND OWNERS COST OF WILDFIRES THAT WAS WHAT YESTERDAY SAYS SIGNING OF THE- OF A BUDGET ACTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY SIGNED ON TO ON MONDAY WAS ALL ABOUT- WE'RE PROVIDING FUNDING. TO UGH UGH ACHIEVE OUR PREVENTION GOALS. THE GOAL OF AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE IS TO ENCOURAGE ROBUST AND REGIONALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS IN FIRE RESILIENCE AND RISK MITIGATION PROJECTS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE STATE'S OVER ALL WILDFIRE RESPONSE IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND HELP JUMPSTART ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE FOREST SECTOR. THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT PROPOSED BY A B. TWELVE FIFTY FIVE WILL IDENTIFY AND DEFINE APPLICABLE REGIONS OF THE STATE ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISTINGUISHING HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION ACTIVITIES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE BILL BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR STATE AND WILL HELP ENSURE THAT EACH REGION IN THE STATE IS BEING TREATED APPROPRIATELY. THERE BOY THEREBY AVOIDING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT WILL ALSO DESCRIBE REGIONAL STRATEGIES ACTIVITIES AND TECHNIQUES TO SUPPORT FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION AND FINALLY. THE DOCUMENT WILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS AND IN COORDINATION WITH OUR EXPERT PUBLIC AGENCIES IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DOCUMENT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR REGIONAL NEEDS. THE FINAL PIECE IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT AND ENSURES THAT THE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT IS NOT DEVELOP UNILATERALLY AND UTILIZES AND PROMOTES EXISTING REGIONAL EXPERTISE. AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE ADVANCES MANY OF THE GOALS AND SOLUTIONS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN THAT WITH WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY THE FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO INNOVATIVE AND EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS THAT TACKLE HABITAT SPECIFIC NEEDS. AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE IS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT OTHER REGIONAL APPROACH AS PUT FORWARD BY MY COLLEAGUES THIS YEAR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH THEM TO SUPPORT THE ENTIRETY OF OUR DIVERSE STATE. THE BILL WRAPPED AROUND EXISTING WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RISK REDUCTION PROGRAMS TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF COMMUNITY SAFETY NEEDS TYPES OF WILDFIRE CONDITIONS. AND THE DIVERSITY OF HABITAT TYPES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE FOUGHT WITH ME. MICHAEL WELL- ON THE PHONE MICHAEL O'CONNELL PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY AND BRITNEY FANTASY GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY AFFAIRS DIRECTOR OF THE SIERRA BUSINESS COUNCIL TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU AND WE'RE READY FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH WILL START WITH MICHAEL O'CONNELL. GOOD MORNING JERRY THIS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I MICHAEL O'CONNELL PRESIDENT AND CEO OF IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'RE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND WE MANAGE THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF FIRE PRONE URBAN WILDLAND IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC LAND OWNERS. THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY IS THAT WILDFIRES DIFFERENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE BUT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY ADDRESSED FIRE RISK FROM AN APPROACH FOCUSED MOSTLY ON FUELS AND SUPPRESSION. THERE ARE IN FACT TWO MAJOR TYPES OF WILDFIRE THAT REQUIRE VERY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THE FIRST FIELD DOMINATED FIRE IS MORE CONVENTIONAL AND REQUIRES FUEL REDUCTION IN TREATMENT BUT THE WILD LAND IN COASTAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE SECOND TYPE WHICH IS NGUYEN DOMINATED FIRE. OUR RISK IS DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF HIGH WINDS AND IGNITIONS AND IS NEARLY INDEPENDENT OF FUELS WE NEED TO BETTER INTEGRATE THIS UNCONVENTIONAL TYPE OF WILDFIRE INTO STATE RESPONSE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND WILDLANDS WE NEED RESOURCES DIRECTED TO THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS IN EACH REGION. THE THREAT OF WIND DOMINATED FIRES ARE NOT EVER GOING TO BE REDUCED BY RESTORING FORESTS ARE THINNING OUT DEAD WOOD IN ORANGE COUNTY WE DON'T EVEN HAVE FORCE WE HAVE TROUBLE AND- THIS IS THE MOMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT A BROADER MORE NUANCED MORE REGIONALLY APPROPRIATE APPROACH. BASED ON HOW FIRE ACTUALLY WORKS UP AND DOWNTHE STATE. THE INTENT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS BILL FOR THE STATE TO COMPILE COORDINATE AND INVEST IN SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR EACH REGION. AND FOR DIFFERENT FIRE REGIMES AND HABITAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THERE'S ALSO GREAT POTENTIAL FOR INTEGRATION AND SYNERGY WITH THE REGIONAL EFFORTS SUPPORTED BY THE REGIONAL FORCED EMPIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THE APPROACH THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM IS PROPOSING AND THANK HIM FOR HIS WORK ON A TWELVE FIFTY FIVE I RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE ON BY TODAY ON AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PRETTY BAD IF YOU IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS COUNCIL AS NOTED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM SCALE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE CREDIT THAT IS MAPPED IN MEETING THAT CHALLENGE REQUIRED BOTH IMMEDIATE ACTION AND EFFICIENT STRATEGIC PLANNING WHICH STARTS WITH ADDRESSING THE NEW WANTED THE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WITHIN EACH REGION OF THE STATE. YOU'RE A BUSINESS COUNCIL THE PURPLE LINE ORGANIZATION BASED IN TRUCKEE AND SERVING THE SIERRA NEVADA REGION. WE'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND AS SO MANY OF US HAVE THE IMPACT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE TORE COMMUNITIES ECONOMY AND ENVIRONMENT. AND WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPOWERING REGIONAL RESILIENCE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. MUCH OF OUR WORK FOCUSES ON THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE RESILIENT. INTERFERE INCREASE IN OUR FOURTH HEALTH NOT ONLY DECREASES OUR WILDIRE RISK IT FRANKLIN'S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR TOURISM AND RESOURCE BASED ECONOMY. THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE FOUND IN ECOLOGICALLY BASED STANDING AND BIOENERGY IN CONCERT IN LOCALLY MANAGED RECREATION AREAS IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR PRESCRIBED FIRECREWS ARE VERY. ADVANCED WHEN ENGINEERING AND MARK. AT THE IT'S PARTICULARLY SUPPORT OF EIGHTY TWELVE FIVE BECAUSE THE PROMOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL PLANNING AND LOCAL INPUT. AB CALL FIFTY FIVE NOT ONLY RECOGNIZES THAT ONE THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL IT RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LOCAL EXPERTS ON THE GROUND WHO KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR THEIR REGION. BY ELEVATING THAT LOCAL EXPERTISE AND INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND THE MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT. BEFORE CLEAR DRASTICALLY INCREASING THE SECTOR'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION AND TRAINING. AB CALL THIRTY FIVE WILL TAKE IMPORTANT STEPS IN EXPLORING THE CURRENT LIMITATION FOR THE STATE COURT COURT AND IDENTIFYING. DID WE DID GET DISCONNECTED FROM. THE AT&amp;T LINE. OKAY I'M SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES. YES PLEASE CONTINUE OUT.

OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS SO BOB HOME HARDENING FOR EXAMPLE- OF MAY BE- AND APPROPRIATE- RESPONSE IN ONE AREA OF THE STATE AND THAT NOT SO MUCH IN ANOTHER. RIGHT THANK YOU BY THIS I THINK IS ACTUALLY. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE- YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE TERRAIN ITSELF NOT THE OTHER ASPECTS. IN DECIDING AND I CAN USE OUR OUR COMMUNITY AS AN EXAMPLE WE ALMOST BURNED P THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO- IN FRENCH ON THE AREA THAT IS HABITAT. AND THAT HABITAT- BURNED UP ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND IT. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THAT AREA. SO THAT WE WOULD SAVE THE REST OF THE HABITAT IT'S THERE IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE IMPEDIMENTS TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BEFORE WELL IT IT SHOULDN'T BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO ANYTHING BECAUSE WHAT THE BILL IS INTENDED TO DO IS SET UP- A PROCESS FOR DETERMINING. IF THE BILL ITSELF DOES NOT DETERMINE WHICH AREA- AND WHICH METHODOLOGIES CORRECTED ANY PARTICULAR PLACE AT THAT PROCESS FOR DETERMINING. IF THAT BECOMES. A KIND OF CATCH POINT AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ACCOMPLISHED THE BILL SCHACK PRECIADO APPRECIATE YOUR BILL I DO- THANK YOU AND THAT IS THE TROUBLE WITH THAT A LITTLE BIT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE BILL IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS WILL BE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU AND- SEE IF THEY'RE IMPROVEMENTS- THAT CAN BE MADE THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS. RIGHT I'D BE GLAD TO TALK TO YOU OFF. OUTSIDE OF THIS AND- AND HELP WORK ON SOME OF THESE- I'VE NOT YET TO BE CONSULTED ON ANY OF THESE BILLS. BY TODD WELCOME THAT WILL MAKE A POINT OF- ENGAGING WITH YOU IN YOUR OWN WORK THANK YOU. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. IT'S TAKING A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO WHAT I'M- THAN THAN WHAT I'M DOING IN A BILL THAT JUST PASSED IN THIS COMMITTEE. I GUESS WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT. MY PERCEPTION OF THIS IS THAT THIS IS KIND OF A TOP DOWN APPROACH. CALIFORNICA READS THE DOCUMENT AND THEN ALL THE REGION'S KINDA DO THEIR WORK OUT BEHIND THE SCENES. THAT KIND OF NEGATES THE- THE GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE IN MY DISTRICT BY GROUPS LIKE NORTH COAST RESOURCE PARTNERSHIP. AND OTHERS- AND WHAT THEY REALLY NEED THEIR OF THEIR THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THEY KNOW THEIR TERRAIN THEY KNOW THE REGION'S WHAT THEY NEED IS THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT. TO GET TROUGH A PROCESS TO QUALIFY FOR GRANTS. FROM CAL FIRE AND CALIO WAS SENT OUT CARILLO YES AND OTHERS. SO WE'D REALLY LIKE. WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS THAT CALVET MAYBE CALIFORNIA. CREATES A DOCUMENT BASED UPON. THE WORK IS BEING DONE ON THE GROUND NOT JUST TAKING STAKEHOLDER INPUT. THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME PRIDE TO SOME FOLKS THAT ARE DOING REALLY REALLY GOOD WORK. THAT ARE GONNA BE LIKE WAIT A SECOND WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS. WHAT READ BEING TOLD FROM A TOP DOWN. WAY THAT THIS IS THAT THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW IF THAT'S THEY MIGHT IF I MISS PERCEIVING WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I. AND I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU DID ON THAT WHILE FAR PACKAGE FOR US AND- IT MEANS A LOT. IT'S A VERY IN MY MIND IS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN WHAT. WHAT I'M LOOKING AT NIGHT COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT CHAPARRAL AND SOME OF THE OTHER HABITATS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF STATES. ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND THE REGIONAL INPUT IS CRITICAL TO THAT. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT A TOP DOWN DOCUMENTS- WITH THAT WITH THE WITH CAL FIRE WHO'S ALREADY STRETCHED BEYOND THEIR LIMITS- ENDS IN FIRE SUPPRESSION YEAR AFTER YEAR. IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO DO THAT. NOT ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT ONE THING. WHILE I APPRECIATE THE HERE IN YOUR WITNESS AND TALKING ABOUT NGUYEN DOMINATED FIRE- YES. YOU GOT HE LOOK AT MY DISTRICT I'M SORRY WE'VE HAD THREE OF THE TOP FIVE FIVE LARGEST FIRES IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE LARGEST AND TWO OF THOSE TOP FIVE TOP BUYERS WERE LAST YEAR. AND WIND DOMINATED THOSE FIRES THE FUEL SOURCES WERE DIFFERENT BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT NGUYEN DID NOT DOMINATE THOSE FIRES AND SO I JUST. POINT THAT OUT- AS SOMEONE WHO EXPERIENCED THAT FIRSTHAND I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN- I AND I THINK- THE- OF THE POINT TO THE WITNESS WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT- DIFFERENT REGIONS DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES- ARE PREVALENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE NEED TO TAKE EACH OF THOSE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT TO THE- EXCLUSION. OF THE OF A CIRCUMSTANCES OF FIRES FOR EXAMPLE ON THE NORTH COAST AND- AND YOUR AREA OR IN THE SIERRAS WHERE ARE OTHER WITNESS SPOKE FROM- THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND ALL REQUIRE- ATTENTION SOME MORE SO THAN OTHERS BUT- CERTAINLY- A DIFFERENT APPROACHES. COME ON ON YOUR OTHER POINT- THIS IS INTENDED TO BE AN INCLUSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND SO- AS I OFFER TO OUR- A COLLEAGUE- I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU WE SEE THESE BILLS YOUR BILLS- AND OTHERS AS COMPATIBLE WITH US WE WANT TO MAKE THEM- AS COMPATIBLE. AS POSSIBLE SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT WITH YOU. I WOULD JUST I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD HOPE THAT I MEAN. THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND WHETHER IT'S IN- ASSEMBLY MEMBER C. ARCOS DISTRICT ARE MATHIS OR OR ANYBODY IN HERE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT KNOW. THE REGION WELL THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DEAL WITH THIS ON ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SO I STILL WONDER YOU KNOW RASKIN CAL FIGHTER A TOP DOWN CREATED DOCUMENT. AND I GUESS I GUESS I GATHER I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE INPUT. BUT WHAT IT REALLY LIKE TO SEE CAL FIRE DO. IS FACILITATE THE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND DEVELOPED BY THE EXPERTS IN THOSE REGIONS RATHER THAN CREATE TAKE ALL THIS INPUT CREATED DOCUMENT AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT. I THINK SO AND LET ME TRY TO REASSURE YOU AND AGAIN WE'LL WORK TOGETHER ON THIS- MR O'CONNELL- FROM THE IRVINE RANCH CONSERVANCY- CAME TO MY ATTENTION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE- WHERE- HE HAS LOCAL. A CONDITIONS THAT HIS ADDRESS ON A LOCAL BASIS AND BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND- IN DOING SO- AND HE LOOKS AT IT FROM THE- PRECISE LENS THAT YOU ARE. TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS- HOW DO WE BRING IN PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF WHO HAVE THAT LOCAL EXPERTISE- AND- YOU DON'T KNOW TH LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND MAKE SURE THAT TO- THE NEEDS OF. LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS ARE RESPECTED IN THE PLANNING THAT WE DO THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT SO I GUESS I WOULD THEN ASK HIM YOU KNOW AND MAYBE A QUESTION FOR HIM IS WHAT DO YOU NEED THE MOST DO YOU NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO THESE PROJECTS. OR DO YOU NEED A DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES HOW YOU DO THAT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHERE THAT'S WHERE THAT. IS PROBABLY STILL ON THE LINE IF- WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS YEAH. HIS PERSPECTIVE ON. HI I AM STILL THE LINE I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND I ACTUALLY- THINK THAT AND I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT I THINK. A BOTTOM UP APPROACH IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY. MANAGE FIRE RISK. GIVEN HOW DIVERSE THE FIRE RISK PROFILES ARE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE NATURE OF THE FIRE ON THE NORTH COAST ALONG THE COASTAL AREAS TO HELP WIN DOMINATED FIRES BUT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT- WE BE ABLE TO DEVELOP. OUR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR REGIONS. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THE ARE FSC PROGRAM. AND THEN HAVE THAT INTEGRATED. INTO THE STATES OF THE STATE CAN SUPPORT THOSE- THOSE PROCESSES AND SO I THINK. I THINK THESE. TWO BILLS SEEM TO BE COMING AT IT. THE SAME THING FROM TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN MEET IN THE MIDDLE. IT AFTER SHE THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO I HAVE A QUESTION OR A COMMENT ABOUT- SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY ON THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THAT IS CREATING THIS GUIDANCE DOCUMENT I THINK SOMEONE HAD. MANSION THAT WAS CAL FIRE THERE UNDER CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YES AND NO CALIFORNIA IS UNDER THE AGENCY THEY WORK TOGETHER WELL THAT'S OKAY FOR SERVICE OKAY. THEY USE PROP ARE- YES YOU TO CREATE THE DOCUMENT OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE A MOTION YET. WHO BECAUSE OF SPACE OKAY. OKAY MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NINE AB TWELVE FIFTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM MEMBERS RIVAS HI RIVERSIDE FLORA. CHAU CHAU AYE FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN I'D GARCIA GARCIA I MATHIS. MCCARTY RIGHT TO G. THEY ARE TOP NO. THERE ARE TWO OH NO STONE. STONE I WOULD I WOULD I. SIX ONE. SIX ONE THAT BILL IS OUT. AND NEXT WE HAVE AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER BLOOM THANK YOU AGAIN- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL AND I ARE CO AUTHORING ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH WILL PROVIDE AN URGENT SHORT TERM FIX TO CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. LOW RETURNED CONSUMER FRIENDLY REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCREASE RECYCLING RATES AND MODERNIZE PROGRAM INCENTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND MARKET PLACE RESILIENCY. WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THE GUIDANCE AND EXPERTISE OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND PREPARE TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THE COMMITTEE IS OF COURSE WELL AWARE OF THE- DETERIORATING STATE OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. A DROP IN GLOBAL SCRAP PRICES HAS REDUCED OUR RECYCLER VALUE BY NINETY FIVE MILLION STATUTORY CONSTRAINTS OF MADE PROGRAM PAYMENTS SLOW AND INSUFFICIENT TO COVER RECYCLING CENTER COSTS DESPITE A FUND SURPLUS THAT TOTALS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THIS FINANCIAL HARDSHIP HAS RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THIRTY CITIES AND THREE ENTIRE COUNTIES HAVE NO BUY BACK RECYCLING CENTERS AT ALL. IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT WITH A POPULATION OF MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WE JUST HAVE ONE REMAINING RECYCLING CENTER. CONSUMERS THAT RECYCLE FOR CASH. AND THAT'S HOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE STILL RETURNED HAVE EXPERIENCED A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PER MONTH DROP IN TOTAL THE BAD NEWS. THERE IS HOPEFUL NEWS AS WELL AND THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY. JUST SEVEN YEARS AGO THE SAME PROGRAM HAD TWICE AS MANY OPERATING CENTERS AND WAS DELIVERING NEAR BEST IN THE NATION RECYCLING RATES OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WITH CALIFORNIA'S STRONGEST IN THE NATION PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECYCLED CONTENT. WE KNOW THAT THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY MUST BUY BACK COLLECTED GLASS AND PLASTIC FOR RECYCLING RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET BACK ON TRACK. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR WILL REINVEST SURPLUS PROGRAM REVENUE TO PROVIDE URGENT INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT NEW AND STRUGGLING STRUGGLING. RECYCLING CENTERS. IT'LL PROVIDE START UP FUNDING IN THE FORM OF FORGIVABLE LOANS TO IMMEDIATELY BRING RECYCLING CENTERS TO THE SIX HUNDRED MOST NEEDY UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. AND TARGETED INCREASE IN PAYMENTS TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR NEW AND EXISTING RECYCLING CENTERS. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FORCE PROVISIONS RELY ON PROGRAM DATA COST SURVEYS AND DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPLEMENT LONG DISCUSSED SYSTEM UPDATES AIMED AT MODERNIZING SIMPLIFYING AND INCREASING RESPONSIVENESS AND RESILIENCY. TO CHANGING MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKET CONDITIONS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS MY STAFF AND I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FULL SPECTRUM OF RECYCLING PROGRAM STAKEHOLDERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT RECYCLERS CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS MATERIAL COLLECTORS PROCESSORS AND MANUFACTURES REMANUFACTURES. AND EVERY TYPE AND SIZE OF RETAILER FROM LARGE SUPERMARKETS TO MOM AND POP GROCERS. WE'VE HEARD MANY THOUGHTFUL IDEAS FOR UPDATING AND EVEN EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. AND THERE MAY NOT BE A CONSENSUS ON ALL OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO US BUT I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A CONSENSUS ON THE CORE TENETS OF AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOR THIS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AND THAT IS TO FOCUS ON FIXING WHAT'S BROKEN. ENSURE THAT EVERY COMMUNITY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDEEM AND AT AND RECYCLE EMPTY CONTAINERS. AND THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT. WE SHOULD MOVE WITH URGENCY. WITH THE AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR UPDATES WE HAVE THE RESOURCES THE FRAMEWORK AND THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITIES TO RETURN CALIFORNIA'S CONTAINER RECYCLING SYSTEM TO ITS FORMER NATIONAL LEADERSHIP STATUS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK ON THE BILL'S PROVISIONS ARE MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND SALLY HOW THàNH WITH THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- WE'RE READY FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH MARK MURRAY MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS IS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- CALIFORNIA IS FACING A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS WHOSE SOLUTIONS ARE COMPLEX AND ELUSIVE RECYCLING NOT NEED TO BE ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS CALIFORNIA HAS THE EXPERIENCE AND THE RESOURCES TO SUSTAIN IT 8285% RECYCLING WITH THE CURRENT PROGRAM. IN FACT WE WERE ACHIEVING THOSE RATES- AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY SIXTEEN AND FOR A DECADE BEFORE THAT- WE CAN GET THERE AGAIN AND IF IN IN AS FEW AS TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS BY BETTER DEPLOYING EXISTING PROGRAM RESOURCES AND MODERNIZING PROGRAM FEATURES- YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM OF REDUCE PAYMENTS REDUCE SCRAP VALUE CLOSURE OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND RECYCLING CENTERS AND A 10215% DROP IN THE RECYCLING RATE. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES WITH PROVEN DATA DRIVEN SOLUTIONS INCREASED PAYMENTS FOR ALL BY BACK RECYCLING CENTERS BY 50% LITERALLY PENNIES PER POUND FOR GLASS AND PLASTIC THESE INCREASES THE SPECIFIC INCREASES ARE DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE MOST RECENT DEPARTMENT COST SURVEY START UP FUNDING TO BRING RECYCLING CENTERS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. RECYCLING RATES RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA OUR SUCCESSFUL 85% OR BETTER IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE AT LEAST ONE RECYCLING CENTER. PER TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. TO GET THERE WE NEED AS FEW AS FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED ADDITIONAL RECYCLING CENTERS. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR HELPS US ET THERE. AND FINALLY THIS MEASURE MODERNIZES PROGRAM RULES AND INCREASES DEPARTMENT FLEXIBILITY TO SITE AND SUPPORT INNOVATIVE COLLECTION OPPORTUNITIES AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY SECONDARY MATERIALS TO MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA WE URGE AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS SALLY HOW TEN FROM THE PLASTIC CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS HOLLY HOLM THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PRTC PRACTICALLY FIGHTING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I'VE GOT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR A BI ONE FOUR FIVE FOUR. PRCC WAS ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AT TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND I'M PROUD TO SAY AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. CURRENTLY P. OFFICE HANDLED APPROXIMATELY FORTY POLKA. OF THE MEDINA PT PACKAGE CONTAINERS IN CALIFORNIA. AT ITS INCEPTION THERE WAS ONLY ONE NEW RECLAIMING. AND NOW THEY'RE ALL SIX AND PLC SHE BUT IN SUPPORT FOR. THE BILL HAS PLAYED A- PART IN THE SUCCESS THAT RECYCLING. BY BUCKLEY AS WE CALL IT GRADE EIGHT IS THE MATERIAL OF CHOICE OF THOSE RECLAIM THE- AND IT'S IMPAIR. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE ALL FIVE ACCENTED AND THE QUALITY MATERIAL THEY PROVIDE. AND HOW THE CALIFORNIA CIRCULAR RECYCLING COMPANY IS BUILT AROUND THAT GREAT. AND ESPECIALLY WOULD. MANDATED CONTENT ON THE HORIZON. THE OFFICE GREATLY THE BOTTLE BILL WRECKING IT SAYS THE SENATE YEARS OLD AND NEED TO MODERNIZE THE- THIS WILL SET IN MY NEED UPDATE AND PRESS. IN TO READ THE BOTTLE BILL. 82% HI WHICH LIKE RATES AND MAKE IT MORE. SECOND TO MAKE DEPARTMENTS. AB ONE FULL CYCLE WILL STAY EVEN THE INDUSTRY THROUGH TARGETED FUNDING AND PROVIDE STARTUP INCENTIVES FOR NEW CENTERS TO OPEN UP AND I'M SAYS. AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. THE BILL AUTHORIZES COUNTERCYCLICAL DESIGNATE REGIONAL CONVENIENCE AND SEVEN MULTIPLE UNDERSTANDS AND- BASED ON THE COMMUNITY NAMED. KNOWLEDGES AND MAY MAKE SENSE IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE STILL CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS TO MEDINA CONTAINS. THIS BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES CAL RECYCLED TOWARD HANDLING FEES TO THE FIRST OPERATOR TO OPEN IN A CONVENIENCE AND THAT HAD BEEN ON THE SENATE FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS. THIS BILL BRINGS A PROGRAM INTO THIS CENTURY BUT WHAT THE RISING CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS TO PAY CLP TO CONCEALMENT OF MATCHES- AND NEKTONIC PAYMENTS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH PAYMENTS. FACILITATING PAID DROPOFF. PROGRAMS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN OREGON. I IT WILL PUSH OUT 50% HIGHER PROFIT PAYMENTS- SET OF TO SIGN CENTER FOR THE FIRST FIVE GLASS CONTAINER. AND TWO HUNDRED SAN PLUS CONTAINERS COLLECTED EACH MONTH. THIS PROVISION WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT SUPPORT TO THE RECYCLING CENTERS THAT REMAIN IN OPERATION AND NAY ENCOURAGING SENTENCED. TELL NATURE OF SCRAPPED BY SHORTENING THE TIME FRAME FOR MODIFYING PROCESSING PAID. COULD COMMINGLED SUPPLY AND ALUMINIUM CANS CONTAINERS MUST BE THAT BASED ON THE TWO OR THREE. INTO CONSUMER THINK NOT MUCH REFER FROM TEN PRC'S BELIEVES WE NEED TO CUT COMING RIGHT TO BE T. ONE RATE TO FOUR PT PRYOR CONTAINER AND ONE FOR REGION PLASTIC BOTTLES OF THE. THE AUSSIE SEE WHAT. ASK BUT YOU ALSO. AB ONE FOUR FIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NECK WILL TO. I WHICH AN OFFICE WE HAVE JAMIE COURT COND WATCH. HI THANK FOR YOU NEED A- THE RETENTION RATE CAL FIFTY SEVEN WE ALL KNOW THE- THIRTEEN HUNDRED CENTER HAD COLLAPSED THE INPUT DON. THIS BILL MAKE AGAINST OR LESS OF A NOT MORE. AND IT DOES WHAT THIS CALL- HAS NOW WHY DO PROGRAM FAILED LIST IS THE- ITS- TO WEAR HAULERS THAT RICH. AND IT- GRIP GROCERY STORES OUT. THE BUSINESS OF CONVENIENCE THE BILL READ DRAWS BIGGER CA ON THAT. FEWER GROCERY STORES WERE HAVE TO BACK AND THESE WHEN WE HAVE A COMMUNITY LIKE SOME MEMBER BLUE WHERE THEY WERE NOT ONE REDEMPTION CENTER. REDRAWN CONVENIENCE TO BE BAY WORKS GROCERY STORES TO- HAPPY TO BACK FOR UP TO OF THE PAYMENT DOES NOT MAKE THINGS MORE CONVENIENT LESS- THEY'RE ALSO BIG SUB TO HAULERS HERE WHICH HAULERS. MORE THAN 50% OF THE MONEY. IN THE PROGRAM ABOUT THE PA'S PROGRAM AND THEY DO LESS THAN 10% OF THE RECYCLING. THIS WOULD BE TO FIVE MILLION. TO HUESO. AND WITH A DUBIOUS PURPOSE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE THIS IS GOING MAKE. CENTER DON'T AND IT TARGETS LOW. VOLUME CENTERS SMALL CENTERS. WE NEED LARGER CENTERS. IF THE BILL WERE AMENDED TO THROW MONEY AT RECYCLING CENTERS THEY SHOULD BE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RECYCLING DESERT'S NOT FOR THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE RECYCLING CENTERS NOW THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. ALL RECYCLING CENTERS REDEMPTION CENTERS TO SHARE THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH TO BRING BACK ANYTHING- IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS- PROGRAM NEEDS WHICH IS- HUNDREDS OF CENTERS AND CENTERS SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS WHERE NOT EXISTS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND HOBBLE SANTA MONICA WHERE THERE'S A HIGH RANKED. THE ADVISORY PANEL UP IS LIKE LETTING THE FOX GUARD THE CHICKEN COOP REGULATED ENTITIES HAVE NO BUSINESS ADVISING REGULATORS- WE HADN'T BROUGHT THESE CONCERNS TO CELEBRATE SOME WITH MEMBERS TENSION AND WE'RE HOPING. YEAH WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE INSTRUMENTS TO GET RID OF THESE BAD PROVISIONS AND DO ONE THING WHICH IS GIVE MONEY TO THE RECYCLING CENTERS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE DESERT- THIS BILL- IS A BILL THAT- USE BUSINESS ONE THAT GIVES AWAY EVERYTHING TO THE WASTE HAULERS IN THE GROCERS AND- IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT. IS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS OR THE ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ONE MORE WITNESS WITH CONCERNS I'M JEFF DON THE DON FROM MEETINGS RECYCLING ARE YOU ON THE LINE.

RECYCLER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL TO REFORM THE BOTTLE BILL. IT BEGINS THE CONVERSATION ON FIXING THE CURRENT BOTTLE BILLS NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH A FEW ITEMS IN THE BILL SUMMER GOOD SUMMER NOT NEEDED IN ONE ITEM WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING RESULTS ON MANY RECYCLING CENTERS. AND POSSIBLY CAUSE MORE CLOSURES IN ALREADY UNDERSERVED AREAS. TODAY THERE'S THIRTY SIX COUNTIES WITH LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR RECYCLING CENTERS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE AREAS THAT NEED HELP NOT ALL RECYCLING CENTERS. AB FIFTY FOUR MAINLY HELPS LOW VOLUME RECYCLING CENTERS AND BY HELPING ALL LOW VOLUME RECYCLING CENTERS IT'S A BASIC MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE REAL PROBLEMS IN THE BOTTLE BILL. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE UNDERSERVED AREAS BRINGING CONVENIENCE PACKED ALL CALIFORNIANS. MEANS IN MANY OTHER RECYCLING CENTERS WILL RESPOND WILL SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT HELPS IMPROVE THE PROGRAM FOR CONSUMERS DELEGATES AUTHORITY TO MAKE CHANGES TO CAL RECYCLE- PREFERABLY DIRECTOR WAGNER GIVE HER THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE SOME CHANGES.

RECYCLING IS 85% EFFECTIVE- IN IN A ONE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RATIO POPULATION B. A ONE RECYCLING CENTER FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT FOR HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND NONE SO I DO WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE TO WONDER TOO FAR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SOME OF THAT'S JUST ENDING UP IN THE REGULAR WAY STREAM SO. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE THAT- IN LARGE IN LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE DID DIP THE TRANSPORTATION FROM ONE ENTITY TO ANOTHER IN THE SITE AND THE PROCESS IS FAIRLY IT COULD BE FAIRLY SHORT IN RURAL COMMUNITIES LIKE HUMBOLDT TRINITY COUNTY IT'S NOT AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT- WE CAN CONSIDER TRANSPORTATION COSTS- WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE. THAT ARE THAT ARE TRYING TO TRYING TO DO THIS RECYCLING- THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR THEM- PEOPLE THINK THAT WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA AND MAYBE THE COST OF YOU MIGHT BE LESS IS ACTUALLY MORE- AND- THE DISTANCES- WHILE ON THE WHILE ON THE MAP TO LOOK VERY FAR THEY'RE OFTEN RUGGED TO MAKE TERRAIN AND DIFFICULT- DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT SO I JUST HOPE THAT WE COULD CONSIDER TRANSPORTATION COSTS- IN IN FUTURE IN THE FUTURE. PARTS OF THIS THAT THIS PROCESS OF THANK YOU SIR YOU'RE WELCOME WILL BE. HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTION FROM MEMBERS.

AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WILDFIRES HAVE CREATED TREMENDOUS IMPACTS ON ON CALIFORNIANS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. OUR STATE IS DOING MORE THAN EVER TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT CHALLENGES ARE MOUNTING EVERY YEAR. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY ONE WILL CREATE THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCIL. INDEPENDENT BODY THAT CAN OFFER EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS TO COORDINATE AND STREAMLINE THE RAY OF. PROGRAMS AND FUNDING AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITIES FOR WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION AND MITIGATION. OVER THE LAST YEAR I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY WELL FOR FIRE STAKEHOLDERS AND I HEARD A CONSISTENT NEED FOR AID. ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL OR LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AB NINETY ONE IS UNIQUE AMONG THE MANY EFFORTS- WELL FOR FIRE FRONTS WHICH I APPLAUD EACH AND EVERYONE WHO'S DOING SO. AND FILLS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THAT FOR THAT FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE. I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETY ONE I HAVE TO EXPERT WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT HELLO ASK THEM TO BE BRIEF. THE FIRST IS KATE DARGAN A RETIRED CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHAL.

THE END OF THE NONPROFIT CALIFORNIA FIRE STATE COUNCIL IS A STATEWIDE WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND PREVENTION ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WE HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. WE CREATED- BACK IN THE ORIGIN DAYS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND THEN ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO BECAME A NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION DEDICATED TO PASSING GRANTS THROUGH AND ADVOCATING FOR THE CREATION OF FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THAT TIME WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF GRANTS FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCY CREATED OVER TWO HUNDRED LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCIL SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIRE WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS TO DEPRESS THAT PROGRAM. IN GENERAL ADVOCATED- BOTH AT SACRAMENTO AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR US FINDING AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION PREPAREDNESS AND RESILIENCY. SO A LONGTIME ADVOCATE OF THE MANY THINGS. THE COMMITTEE IS EXAMINING TODAY. WE BELIEVE THAT CAL. BUT CONTINUE TO TAKE BOLD. WHILE TRY REVEALING IS NOW GOING TO COME EASILY IS NOT GOING TO COME CHEAP. AND IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF LIFT FROM EVERYONE ENGAGED- FROM MANY MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP INCREASE THE COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO OCCUR. IT WILL HELP REDUCE CONFLICT IT WILL HELP ALIGN POLICIES AND IT WILL HELP DEVELOP NEW IDEAS FOR MANY DIVERSE VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES THERE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. THE DIVERSE VOICES INCLUDE SAFETY ENTITIES. INSURANCE SECTOR SOCIAL SERVICES ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS PLANNING BUILDING LAND MANAGERS WON'T USE PLANNERS EDUCATORS AIR AND WATER QUALITY EXPERTS PUBLIC HEALTH. I MET SCIENTISTS HOME BUILDERS AND MORE I'M GOING TO READ YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE PLEASE WRAP UP THIS YEAR OVER YEAR TENANTS BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO WHEN ARE NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF EXISTENCE WE BELIEVE THAT. PUTTING A BODY TOGETHER LIKE THE MANY OTHER COUNCILS THAT EXIST WHETHER IT'S THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THE BIO DIVERSITY COUNCIL THE STEP DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL IT IS TIME TO DEVELOP A COORDINATING MULTI VERSE GROUP.

IT IS ESTIMATED TO DO SO WELL INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE CURRENT AND PROJECTED IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDE. INCREASED TEMPERATURE SEA LEVEL RISE INTENSE WILDFIRES ALTERED PRECIPITATION PATTERNS EXCESSIVE FLOODING SEVERE DROUGHT. IN MORE FREQUENT STORM EVENTS MANY IMPACTS WILL VARY BASED ON A COMMUNITIES PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS WHICH TEND TO EXTEND BEYOND CITY OR COUNTY BOUNDARIES THIS MAKES REGIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS.

OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HOWEVER MANY ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEGUN COORDINATING THIS REPAIRED AS WITH ADJACENT ENTITIES IN THE REGION AND SOME OF NOT BEGUN PLANNING. AT ALL DUE TO THIS LACK OF COORDINATED PLANNING THE STATE'S CURRENT MECHANISM FOR FUNDING ADAPTATION PROJECTS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY PIECEMEAL WITH NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATING ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESILIENCY RETURN. AB NINE AB EIGHT NINE SEVEN RATHER SEEKS TO FILL THIS GAP.
