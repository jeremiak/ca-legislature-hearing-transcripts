WILDLIFE. TUESDAY APRIL TENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM ON US ARE. COMMITTEE SECRETARY AT DISTANCE GENTLEMEN WELCOME TO WATER PARKS ONTO MORNING AND WELCOME GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS I'M THINKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO. THE GOAL OF WHICH IS TO MAKE OUR STATE PARKS MORE PET FRIENDLY AND EXPAND ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S PET OWNERS. PETS ARE BEYOND ON MOST HIKING AND WALKING TRAILS IN CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS. THAT MEANS MANY FAMILIES APART FROM VISITING CALIFORNIAS PARKS BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO VACATION WITH THEIR PETS. THESE FAMILIES MUST WRECK RATE IN OTHER PARKS OR SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY BOARDING THEIR PAT'S IF THEY SIMPLY OPT TO GO OFFERED. BY OUR BEAUTIFUL VAST PARK SYSTEM. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO WOULD SHIFT CALIFORNIA STATE PARK PET POLICY. RETURNS ABOUT TO BECOME MORE PET FRIENDLY AND ENABLE MORE FAMILIES TO VISIT OUR STATE PARKS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK ME RIGHT OUT. REALLY MOTION THERE'S A SECOND. ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. IN WHICH IS SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THE NO ONE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MANY MEMBERS. SO WE DO OF YES. I IF I GET TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION AYE DOES THE BILL AFFECT THE STATE BEACHES WITHIN THE STATE PARKS. YEAH I'M YES TO ASSEMBLYMAN HARPER HE AND I HAVE HAD A DISCUSSION I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT. I WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO ALLOW. THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EVEN BANNED A DOC'S PRESENCE ON STATE BEACHES IF SO CHOSEN. YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO ONE ELSE WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO PUT HELP ONE MORE QUESTION OR SAW MYSELF FAR. A THIS IS A GOOD IDEA HOWEVER WHEN OUT TALKS OUT AND OUT I THINK OF FROM THE BEGINNING IT. THAT YEAH THERE WERE A BAND THAT YOU TO MAYBE. IN ON THE RECENT SO ENOUGH WITH THE TRAPPINGS OF THINGS LIKE THAT AS THE ANY PROFESSION NOW HOW WE CAN NOW. I HAVE THE THOUGHT WANNA SO BE RESPONSIBLE TO CLEAN UP. IN OUR AFTER DOGS FOR QUORUM NOW. CLOSING NOT FULLY COMMENTS I'VE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVE UP WE'LL HAVE TO THE. WHAT WILL LEAVE THE CALL OPEN ARMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH? WE HAVE. ANY OTHER AUTHORS. SURE. PRESENT. GOING TO GOODNESS GOV LIKE BUT I THINK ISN'T AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN. WHICH COULD CREATE A WATER INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY. HAVE. IN THE OROVILLE AREA. AS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY OR THOSE AT A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE. THE DAMN BUT. HE ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT OF THIS IS THE AREA WHERE. MOST OF THE WATER IS COLLECTED FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY TWENTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE. ARE RELY ON THE WATER OUT OF OR VILLAINOUS. AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO IN IMPROVE OUR INNOVATION. AND CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY. WITH WATER. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO THIS IS TO CREATE A A WATER TECHNOLOGY HUB AND THE OROVILLE AREA WHERE THERE WOULD BE TAX INCENTIVES TO CREATE. NEW WATER. TECHNOLOGY CONSERVATION. BUSINESSES. TIME. AND SO. ME I THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ON ON THINGS THAT WE. IT WE ALREADY HAVE DONE ACTUALLY HAD OF MY DISTRICT. A YOUNG MAN ACTUALLY OUT OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY. OF FROM THE CHICO AREA WHO HAD. DEVELOP A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT TAKES DIRTY WATER AND MAKES IN THE CLEAN WATER AND I ACTUALLY TAKES INTO AND EVEN SALT WATER MAKES INTO CLEAN WATER USING. LESS ENERGY NOW THAT TECHNOLOGY STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S NOT BE A TOTALLY READY FOR. MASS PRODUCTION YEAH. BUT HE ENDED UP TAKING THAT BUSINESS AND IDEA TO TEXAS. JUST BECAUSE OF THE BETTER. INCENTIVES THAT HE COULD GET THERE TO TO START UP THAT. THIS IDEA SO. I'D RATHER KEEP THOSE INNOVATORS HERE. AND USE THAT TECHNOLOGY FOR CALIFORNIA AND ALSO BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA BEHIND THIS. AND I WOULD YOU KNOW ASK YOUR AYE VOTE IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY NINE FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK UP IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE. FROM THE AUDIENCE. AGAINST ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM YOUR COMMITTEE. AND WE WE DO HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO MISTER CELIS QUESTION. LARGE GRASS OUT THERE FUSE HE MAKES OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT YES I AM ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. HIS QUESTION ALSO THAT EARLIER. OKAY USER THE WISHES OF THE COMMITTEES ARE MOTION. I HAVE A QUESTION YES. WELL WHY ARE YOU LIMITING TO OUR ORGAN AREA. ONLY. YOU KNOW REALLY THE WHY I'M FOCUSING ON THAT BECAUSE THAT IS ACTUALLY WHERE MOST OF OUR WATER IS COLLECTED AND STORED IN IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT SEEMED LIKE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE YOU KNOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN THEN BE. AND OTHER DEVELOPED THEIR CAN THEN BE BROUGHT OUT INTO THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO THE ABILITY TO TEST. YOU KNOW THINGS I THINK A LOT MORE EASILY. IN THE IN THE OROVILLE AREA WHERE WE HAVE. INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER THINGS IN PLACE. SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE IMPETUS BEHIND IT. IN THE WINTER TALK ABOUT THE TAX CREDIT THOUGHT. IT. IS. IT IS SAID THEN TIE UP COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT THE WARRIOR A CERTAIN PORTION OF HAD THE. DO YOU KNOW. WHAT IT WAS SWISS SPECIFICALLY YOU ARE SUGGESTING? IT WOULD REALLY JUST BE A TAX CREDIT FOR ACTUALLY EMPLOYEE WAGES SO IF YOU START. A BUSINESS THERE YOU GET A FIFTY PERCENT NE. TAX CREDIT FOR A QUALIFIED EMPLOYEE THAT'S HIRED IN THE IN WATER TECHNOLOGY. SO THE BUSINESS WILL GET A TAX CREDIT ON THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND THAN THAT IT DECREASES OVER TIME BUT IT KIND OF GIVES IN THAT INITIAL. INCENTIVES AFTER THEIR STARTUP. THANK YOU. ALREADY WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MATHIS SECOND BY MISTER. HARPER. AND THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I DO HAVE A QUORUM NOW. SEVEN. NOT YET. OKAY WE DON'T. SO WE GOT A. SET UP A QUORUM AND THEN WILL TAKE ACTION ON THE BILL. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. OR IMMENSELY. YEAH. DID. SO ALL. WOULDN'T IT WILL TAKE A VOTE ON THIS ONE SO THAT'S EXACTLY HOW ACTUAL. FOR LIVING. QUORUM. NO WILL CALL QUESTION ON. YOU GALLAGHER IS ITEM. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE.

GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MAY OF WE HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO. THINK ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO PUT TO US SOME OF THESE THINGS INTO THE BILL. OUR BUT WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THANK YOU AGAIN STAFF. AND CHAIR. L. A. B. TWENTY FIFTY THREE DIRECTIONS STATE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH SHE FESTS FRESH WATER AND S. DURING. HARMFUL ALGAL. BLOOM PROGRAM TO COORDINATE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXINS PRODUCED BY THESE BLOOMS. ALGERIAN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF MANY ECO SYSTEMS. HOWEVER CERTAIN TYPES OF ALGAE PRODUCE TOXINS INCLUDING LIVER AND NORA TOXIC. THESE TOXINS HAVE MADE CHILDREN WHO PLAYING BLOOMS POLLUTED WATER. SEC AND HAVE DIRECTLY. BEEN LINKED TO THE DEATH OF PETS AND SEA OTTERS. TOXIC ALGAL BLOOMS USED TO OCCUR PRIMARILY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS. HOWEVER DUE TO THE WARMING CLIMATE THEY'VE INCREASINGLY FLOURISHED YEAR ROUND. IN FACT THE NUMBER OF REPORTED FRESHWATER TOXIC ALGA BLOOM SHEERLY DOUBLED. ARE IN THE LAST YEAR. MULTIPLE BODIES OF WATER CURRENTLY IMPAIRED INCLUDING LIKE SHOULD BOW IN MY DISTRICT. ARE THE MULTI YEAR BLOOM AT LAKE SHAPIRO HAS POISONING CAL AT LEAST THREE PET DOGS WHO DRANK OR SWIM IN THE WATER. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE ARE MAPPED. GROWLED THE CHIEF STEWARD THE CHIEF OF STEWARDSHIP IN THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT AND JENNIFER WILLIAMS WITH EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. AND MEMBERS. RETURN MEMBERS UP MY NAME'S JENNIFER WILLIAMS I'M WITH THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITIES DISTRICTS. EVEN PROVIDES DRINKING WATER TO ONE PART ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CUSTOMERS AND ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY OUTH. WE OPERATE SEVEN RESERVOIRS USED FOR WATER SUPPLY FIVE OF WHICH ARE OPEN FOR OUR PUBLIC RECREATION. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE TODAY. ALGAL BLOOMS ARE NATURAL PHENOMENON AND WHILE NOT ALL ALGAL BLOOMS ARE HARMFUL SOMEHOW GOLDBLUM'S MAY CONTAIN TOXINS AND IT IS SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR WHAT TRIGGERS THE PRODUCTION OF TOXINS. AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE WOULD PROMOTE THE PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AS A DOCTOR COURT STATED M. IT WOULD FORMALIZE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S AYE ROLE IN COORDINATING A STATEWIDE RESPONSE TO ADDRESSING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. AND I AS I MENTIONED WE WE'VE TO THE SPAM I'VE DOES HAVE SEVEN RESERVOIRS AND IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN. A FEW ALGAL BLOOMS IN SOME OF OUR RESERVOIRS THOUGH HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS ARE RARE IN OUR DRINKING WATER RESERVOIRS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT. THE QUALITY OF THE DRINKING WATER OUR CUSTOMERS ULTIMATELY RECEIVE HAS NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. BY. WE DO HAVE A REGULAR MONITORING PROGRAM AND WHEN THERE IS AN ALCOHOL BLOOM AS THERE HAS BEEN THAT LIKES ABOUT WHICH IS ONE OF OUR EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER SUPPLY RESERVOIRS. AND THEN THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS OF AYE PAT'S BEING POISONED THERE. WE WORKED DIRECTLY AND WITH OUR RECREATION SERVICE PARTNERS EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT TO INVESTIGATE THE BLOOM TEST. AND MONITOR WATER QUALITY WORK TO MITIGATE THE BLOOM AND PROMOTE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS BANNING BODILY CONTACT. I'M ALL THAT BEING SAID WE THINK THAT AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE STATE UNDERTAKES RESEARCH AND DATA COLLECTION NEEDED. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT SAM TO BETTER PROTECT AND MANAGE ALGAL BLOOMS WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY I ULTIMATELY HELP PROVIDE WATER PROVIDERS SUCH AS EAST BAY MIND. TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ALGAL BLOOMS AND INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE HARMFUL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SPEAKER. GIVE THEM A MAD CRAWL IN THE CHIEF OF SECURITY FOR THE SPIRITUAL PARK DISTRICT AND I OVERSEE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS A DISTRICT. AND PRIMARILY THE WATER QUALITY AND WILDLIFE PROGRAMS. THE EAST REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WE OPERATE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. IN EAST BAY OF THOSE SAMPLES KOBE. WE SERVE OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR FROM THROUGH THE REGION AND WE ALSO HAVE NINE. RESERVOIRS AND LAKES THAT WE OPERATE FOR A RECREATIONAL. VALUES AND AND NINE OF THOSE RESERVOIRS THAT WE OPERATE. ABOUT FIVE OF THEM ALLOW BODY CONTACT WATER RECREATION I WHICH IS SWIMMING. WE ALSO ALLOW FISHING IN AND ALL NINE OF THOSE RESERVOIRS AND ALSO ALLOW OR KAYAKING IN THE RESERVOIRS AND OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH BLUE GREEN ALGAE BLOOMS WE'VE HAD BLOOMS. OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THE FIRST TOXIC BLOOM WE HAD WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THAT RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF ONE OF OUR LAKES AND AROUND THAT SAME TIME THAT. THAT'S TIME WE HAD A DOG THREE DOG BEST THAT LECTURE ABOUT WHERE THE TIME. AND THAT WAS DESPITE. SIGNAGE NOTIFICATION TO THE PUBLIC AND TESTING WE WERE DOING. BUT DESPITE THAT NOTIFICATION WITH THE PEOPLE STILL OUT ME AND GOT TO THE EDGE OF THE WATER IN AND AND UNFORTUNATELY. WE HAD THESE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES SO WE REALLY HAD TO STEP UP OUR MONITORING PROGRAM I DO A LOT MORE MONITORING A WEEKLY AND ALSO TO TRAIN OUR STAFF TO BILL TO SEE. BLOOMS AND REPORT THEM. A AND DO ALL THE TESTING AND NOTIFICATION NOW ALL THIS IS BEEN POSSIBLE BY USING NATIONAL GUIDANCE AND A WORK WITH THE STATE AGENCIES. BUT OFTEN OF THEIR TIME IS LIMITED AND THE AN EFFORT DISEASE USING STUDIES FROM OTHER AREAS AND THIS TASK FORCE WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN COORDINATING A STATEWIDE EFFORTS. THERE'S A VERY QUALIFIED TAFF AT THE WATER BOARD AND AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT RIGHT NOW THE EFFORTS AREN'T COORDINATED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS AND. ARE WE WOULD BE A STRONG PARTNER IN THAT AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THOSE AGENCIES BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE. THIS EFFORTS COORDINATED UP ON A STATEWIDE BASIS BUT OF THE RESEARCH THAT'S GOING AND HOW TO TREAT THESE BLOOMS THE HAD REDUCE TOXIN FORMATION IS. JUST BEING DEVELOPED AND WOULD LIKE THE STATE REALLY BECOME A LEADER. IT IN THIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE RESEARCH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND. DATA AND BETTER HELP DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOR NOTIFICATION AND AND STOPPING THESE TOXIC BLOOMS. IT'S THAT RECREATIONAL DIVIDE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE BAY AREA AND A VERY IMPORTANT. TO THAT THE AND AND THE TOWNS ARE FACING ARE BEING EXPERIENCED A WIDE THOUGH OF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING BUT THAT THE FREQUENCY OF THESE BLOOMS. OF HAS BEEN LASTING MUCH LONGER AND AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER STATED THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THESE. EH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOW USUALLY THEY WERE IN THE SUMMER I CAN TAILOR AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER. WE'VE HAD BLOOM IS HAPPENING NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND JANUARY AND SO RESERVOIRS THAT THAT DOESN'T AFFECT SWIMMING AS MUCH BUT THAT'S A AFFECT FISHING INTO OUR RESERVOIRS AND ALSO SOME OF THE THE BOATING ACTIVITIES. SO I COULD YOUR SUPPORT AND. THINK THIS IS A WELL GO GET STEP TO BETTER COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS JUST MILAN FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTORS. COMPLETELY CONCUR WITH THIS BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS THERE IS A BIT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT SOURCE THE PARKS DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND STATE WATER BOARD AND WE WOULD URGE THAT TELL YOU INCLUDE LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE CO ORDINATION. BECAUSE SOMETIMES ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IS CALLED UPON TO ACTUALLY POST TO CLOSE THESE THESE LAKES WHEN IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE JURISDICTION OF PARK SCHOOL WOULD HAVE DISTRICTS SO WE URGE AYE VOTE IN THIS BILL. YOU NOT WISHING TO SPEAK CA. FAVOR THE MEASURE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TROUT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. TEAMED UP. NO ONE ELSE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO MAKE. MOTION. AND A SECOND MY SO MEMBER RUBIO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SUMMER MATHIS ARM QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. I I KNOW THIS YEAR NEVADA AS WE'VE DEALT WITH THE YELLOW LAID TREE FROG IN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH THERE THAT PART OF THE. THEM DYING OFF WAS BECAUSE OF THE ALGAE BLOOMS IN THE HIVE LAKES. I JUST WANNA ASK WILL YEAR BE THAT WITH THIS BILL WILL ALSO BE LOOKING INTO THOSE AREAS AS WELL. IN CAN IN RESEARCH ON THOSE ALGAE BLOOMS SO. WHAT HAS HAD? THE YOM. THE WATER BOARD CONVENED A. A STUDY GROUP WITH A TOP PEOPLE. AND THE IDEA THIS SPELL IS TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. AND BRING IT FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTATION SO THIS IS A REALLY TALKING ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. I DO NOT KNOW OUR DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THEY'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON THE FROG. YEAH SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE LOOKED AT FROGS BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE LOOKING. AT WAYS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS AND THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY HELP OUT THE FROGS ARE BUT I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT MORE AND GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE OKAY I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE STATE'S BEEN MONEY ON DOING RESEARCH ON THE ALGAE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL ASPECTS. BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF MY HIGH SIERRA TRAILS CLOSE. OVER YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINKING THAT HUMANS WERE CAUSING THE FROG DEATH WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY THE ALGERIAN THOUGH. IF WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE RESEARCH IS GOING EVERYWHERE AND. YET WE WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT AND. THAT'S AGAIN IT THEY ARE LOOKING AT MITIGATION THAT SHOULD HELP IN ANY CASE BUT WILL LOOK SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ARE HIGH. THE HIGH LAKES IN THE SIERRAS. THEY WILL ASK ABOUT THAT. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. I'M THIS IS. TRIGGERING SOMETHING FOR ME. WHEN I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE. DEALING WITH THERE'S LAKES AND RESERVOIRS ARE MANAGED BY ACTUALLY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION UP IN MY OF THE IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO TREAT FOR ALGAL BLOOM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY RAN INTO IS THAT CERTAIN TREATMENTS THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO EVEN THOUGH? MUNICIPALITIES ARE ALLOWED TO DO THE TREATMENTS THAT ACTUALLY PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS GROUPS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO. AND SOME OF THE TREATMENT SAID THAT THEY HAD DONE JUST HAD TO DEAL WITH IT. THERE WAS AN EFFECT TO FISH FOR FOR SOME REASON AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY HAD FISH AND WILDLIFE CAMINO AND SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN LIKE SOME KIND OF. NO THAT ONE A TRY THE COORDINATION I THINK IS IMPORTANT ON THE SO ONE QUESTION HOW DOES HAVE ENOUGH ANYBODY KNOWS THIS BUT. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TREATMENTS? LETTER DONE THE KIND OF COMBAT THE ALGAL BLOOM BLOOM AT THIS POINT. SO A MATT GROW GIVE CHIEF STRICTLY THREE REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT UP SORTING A VARIETY OF THINGS OF THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU CAN DO ONE YOU CAN. TREAT WITH THEM HIS A BENIGN PRODUCT SOMEBODY HYDROPEROXIDE WHEN YOU HAVE A BLOOM LOVE THAT'LL THAT'LL REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE BLOOM BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WHEN YOU. A TREAT WITH THE HYDROPEROXIDE BASED PRODUCTS IT BREAKS THE CELL WALLS AND RELEASES THE TOXINS SO THEN YOU CAN HAVE AN INCREASE PERIOD OF TOXIN. PRODUCTION EVEN THOUGH THE ALBUM LOOK BETTER THEY TO LOOK CLEAR ABOUT YOU MADE THE TOXINS IN THE WATER SO WHAT WE FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. IN MANY OF OUR AS WE JUST TREATING NUTRIENTS AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE NUTRIENTS ARE WHAT FEED THE BLOOM SEE OF HIGH PHOSPHORUS AND NITROGEN. IN THE RESERVOIRS SO WE'VE BEEN PUTTING PRODUCTS. IN INTO THE BOTTOM THE LAKE TO FIND THOSE NUTRIENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO FEED THE ALGAE AND THOSE TREATMENT OR MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE MORE LONG TERM. BUT I CAN SAY THAT THEY THAT THAT WORK PICK WHAT COORDINATION WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD WHETHER AND PANEL HEALTH DEPARTMENT A TO GET THE PERMITS TO DO THAT WORK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THOSE PERMITS BECAUSE REPUBLIC AGENCY BUT I CAN IMAGINE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION ANOTHER. TRYING TO WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR AND COORDINATE WITH THE WATER BOARD AND NOT HAVING THAT SAME LEVEL OF. LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING HADDOCK A COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS THAT ALREADY IN PLACE. IT CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING SO I THINK WE HAD THE COORDINATION IS ESSENTIAL SOMETHING MAYBE THIS IF FOR SOMEONE IF MOVE FOR MAYBE TRYING TO INCLUDE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT PRIVATE GROUPS THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED WITH MANAGING. RESERVOIRS AND LAKES RIGHT TED THIS IS CLEARLY VERY IMPORTANT I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'LL FIT INTO THIS BILL BUT IF IT DOES THEN I PROMISE TO BRING SOMETHING BACK NEXT YEAR. A TO DEAL WITH. LIKES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY OKAY I JUST CAN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT IT A COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. OF BUT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT I PROMISE I WILL GET TO. IF NOT THIS YEAR THEN NEXT AND AS I UNDERSTAND REALLY YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO GET WATER BOARD. TO COORDINATE WITH ALL THESE GROUPS ON LIKE THAT SORT OF THE A MORE UNIVERSAL WAVE. COMBATING ALGAL BLOOM IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT YEAH AND THE POINT HERE IS THE REASON FOR THEIR DOING IT WITH THE WATER BOARD IS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN. THE. INITIATIVE IN TERMS OF BRINGING A GROUP TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE VARIOUS. STRATEGIES ARE AND YOU JUST HEARD FROM MR GROWL. HOW? SOME STRATEGIES CAN MAKE IT WORSE IN OTHERS. CAN BE PREVENTIVE AND. IDEALLY. IF THE WATER BOARD COULD COME UP WITH SOME STANDARD. PERMIT. THAT PEOPLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY COULD ASK FOR THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHETHER I CAN DO IT IN THIS BILL ARE NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT AGAIN I PROMISE TO DO IT EITHER THIS YEAR AND NEXT OCCUR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS I WOULD THAT. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THOUGHT YES I HEARD. THE. SHARON FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES WE WILL CERTAINLY BE TALKING WITH THEM. AND. AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYTHING IS COORDINATE WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES THANK YOU I ASKED WE ARE AYE VOTE. OKAY THAT MADAM CLERK WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. EDUARDO GARCIA. GALLAGHER AYE GALLAGHER AYE BIGELOW. BELOW I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE CHOI AYE CHOI AYE CHU. CHIU AYE FRIEDMAN. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE HARPER. KALRA. LEVINE. LEVINE AYE MATHIS. MATHIS AYE RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE SOLACE. SOLACE I WOULD. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE CARILLO SCRIPT THING. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PERCENT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE A BILL THAT TAKES COMMON SENSE STEPS TO SAY WATER BY IMPROVING LANDSCAPES DESIGN IRRIGATION SYSTEMS. AND URBAN WATER USE PRACTICES I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THAT COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANKING THEM FOR. THE WORK WITHIN THAT'S BEING DONE WITH MY STAFF TO. THEN THE SPONSORS TO ENHANCE THIS BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOHN LAYERED WITH SIGNED INTO LAW AND DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES OR D. WR. TO CONVENE AN INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL PANEL TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS WHO D. W. ARE. AND THE LEGISLATURE ON WAYS TO MAKE LANDSCAPE WATER USE MORE SUSTAINABLE IN OUR STATE. HOWEVER. SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PANEL HAVE YET TO BE ACTED UPON NEARLY TWO YEARS AFTER. THE PANEL COMPLETED ITS WORK. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WATER IS USED OUTDOORS IN CALIFORNIA CITIES AND TOWNS REDUCING WATER USE ON URBAN LANDSCAPE STATEWIDE. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF WATER USED BY THE ENTIRE. CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN ONE YEAR. WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE CAN ALSO RESULT IN LESS AND LESS INSTABILITY IN URBAN WATER DEMAND AND IMPROVE. THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AND SAVINGS OVER WATER UTILITIES. AND CA AND CUSTOMERS. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE ADVANCE A SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TECHNICAL PANEL'S REPORT THAT HAVE POTENTIALLY THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE LANDSCAPE WATER USE EFFICIENCY. AND OUR STATE. BY IMPROVING LANDSCAPE WATER EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING WASTE WE CONCEIVE ENERGY. LOWER WATER AND A WASTE WATER TREATMENT COSTS ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR COSTLY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HELP CALIFORNIA MEET OUR SHORT AND LONG TERM WATER CHALLENGES. MANY WHICH JONI IN THE LAKOTA LANGUAGE MEANS WATER IS LIFE. AND WATER IS AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE IT'S AN ESSENTIAL RESOURCE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE AIMS TO LOWER WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT COSTS AND HELP ENSURE THE AFFORDABILITY. OF THESE VITAL SERVICES IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I APPRECIATE THE INCREASE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALBOA PARK. AND I SHARE THE INTEREST IN ENSURING THE BILL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INCLUSIVE. AND NOT HARMFUL TO WORKERS OR CONSUMERS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IN THE CONSIDERATIONS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. REGARDING HOME INSPECTIONS AND I WILL INPUT AND WELCOME THE INPUT OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY. OUR GLENFERRIE ALL OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND AT AUSTIN FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. THANK. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. STEPPING IN FOR GLENN LAST MINUTE HERE I'M MY NAME IS JEFF STEVENSON AND I'M WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY. I ALSO SERVED AS ONE OF THE SEVEN. STATE WHITE PANEL MEMBERS ON THE INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL PANEL THAT DEVELOPED THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING LANDSCAPE WATER USE EFFICIENCY. MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT YOU YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE INCLUDING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FRIEDMAN RUBIO GLORIA. GALLAGHER AND BIGELOW HAVE PLAYED LEADERSHIP ROLES IN HELPING CALIFORNIA SHAPE ITS LONG TERM WATER CHRISTIANS POLICY. WHETHER THAT PACKAGE OF BILLS COMES TOGETHER IN THE COMING DAYS WEEKS OR MONTHS. IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THE FINAL STATUTORY PACKAGE WILL LIKELY INCLUDE OUTDOOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. WELL AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE DOESN'T CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT WOULD STAND ALONE AS LANDMARK WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES. COLLECTIVELY THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE ARE IMPORTANT IN HELPING WATER MANAGERS IN WATER CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOVE FORWARD AND MEETING ANY NEW OUTDOOR WATER USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE THE SORT OF COMMONSENSE TOOLS THAT CAN HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY. AND WATER CONSERVATION ETHIC. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE AND ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE MEASURE THIS MORING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS IT. SAN AMONG THE WATER PROGRAM OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M ALSO SERVED ON THE IDW ARE INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL PANEL ON URBAN WATER EFFICIENCY FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH HIS SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY. THE BILL YOU HAVE A BEFORE YOU. HAS ABOUT FIVE OR SIX VERY DISCRETE COMPONENTS TO IT. EACH ELEMENT OF THE BILL IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM FROM THE OTHERS AND I THINK THAT REFLECTS THE FACT THAT. PANEL STUDIED THIS ISSUE THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WATER THAT USED OUTDOORS. ENOUGH. IN CALIFORNIA THAT A WEEK ADDRESSED A NUMBER OF WAYS TO TRY TO. REDUCE OR ELIMINATE EXCESSIVE WATER USE OUTDOORS NUMBER STRATEGIES A NUMBER OF TOOLS. COMING AT IT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE PRODUCT THAT'S HOW THIS. THIS. RATHER DIVERSE SET OF RECOMMENDATINS GOT ASSEMBLED AND GOT IN FRONT OF YOU HERE TODAY. WE'RE JUST SUPPORT FOR THE BILL WITH THE. I BELIEVE THERE FIVE COMMITTEE. AMENDMENTS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED. OTHER TESTIMONY OR PEOPLE IN SUPPORT THEM ON AND ON. A MARINE ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SEEN NO OTHER A TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. HI MY NAME IS DAVE PACE I M. OF THE LEGISLATIVE. CHAIR FOR CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INSPECTION ASSOCIATION. AND IMMEDIATE PAST CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THAT ASSOCIATION. A WE ARE NOT WE HAVE NOT EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BUT WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE AUTHOR. AND. GO OVER SOME CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE TO CLEAR A SECTION TO THE BILL. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSERIES AND GARDEN CENTERS. WE ARE IN OPPOSITION THE BILL WERE NOT IN OPPOSITION TO THE GOALS THE BILL. AND THE NURSERY GARDEN CENTER IN INDUSTRY THE STATE CALIFORNIA I THINK HAS PLAYED A. VERY STRONG ROLE. OVER THE YEARS IN DOING OUR PART TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS. AND PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE WHERE WE CAN SPECIALLY AT THE RETAIL CENTER OUT FOR CONSUMERS AS THEY MAKE. THEIR PURCHASING OF OUTDOOR LANDSCAPE. WE'VE ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH IRRIGATION INDUSTRY A LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS BECAUSE REALLY. THEN THE MAIN SOURCE OF LANDSCAPE WASTE OUR OUR IRRIGATION SYSTEM. AND NOT WITHSTAND THE FACT THAT WE'VE START TO INCORPORATE WE DO INCORPORATE MUCH MORE TRIPS SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT MEANS NOTHING IF THE CONSUMER AT THE END OF THE DAY THE HOMEOWNER AT THE END OF THE DAY THE PROPERTY OWNER CANDIDATE DOESN'T IT JUST THAT IRRIGATION SYSTEM ACCORDINGLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IS THAT COME WITH THE WEATHER AND THE CLIMATIC DIFFERENCES. OUR CONCERN WITH THIS IS IS REALLY TWO FOLD AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE SPECIFIC AREA THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH THE LABELING OF PLANTS. FIRST. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'LL PROVIDE THE EDUCATION OR THE KNOWLEDGE THE CONSUMER. THAT THE BILL PROFESSOR SO IT WILL FOR EXAMPLE. IT'LL BE A NURSERY AYE IN TULARE COUNTY OR KINGS COUNTY OR MADERA COUNTY THAT'S ACTUALLY PRODUCING THIS THESE PLANTS THAT WILL MOVE ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HERE NOW REQUIRING THAT NURSERY OWNER TO ACCOMMODATE AND PLAN FOR WHERE THOSE PLANTS WILL ULTIMATELY END UP TO PROVIDE A LABEL THAT WILL BE SPECIFIC TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THE CLIMATIC AREA. FOR THAT PLANT THE IT SAYS IT IN THE ANALYSIS THAT I'M A PLANT LIKE AN AZALEA. MAY BE CONSIDERED A HIGH WATER PLANT. BUT THAT COULD CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WHERE IT'S PLANTED. AND CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE DO HAVE A FLOURISHING NURSERY INDUSTRY. ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT CLIMATIC pAREAS THE GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO PLANT A LARGE VARIETY OF PLANTS. ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT PLANT IS GROWN. ITS WATER USE WILL CHANGE SO. PLANTS ARE SOPHISTICATED BEANS AND THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT GOES INTO THE CARE AND NURTURE OF A PLANT THAN SIMPLY A LABEL. AND WORK SO WERE AFRAID THAT JUST BY PUTTING A LABEL ON A PLANT WILL NOT GIVE THE TYPE A NOTICE THAT A CONSUMER WOULD REALLY NEED TO MAKE THOSE BUYING DECISIONS. SECONDLY IT'S GONNA ADD INCREASED LABOR. TO THE NURSERY INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING OF WITH. YOU NOTE THAT THE ECONOMY IS IS COMING BACK HAS BEEN SLOW ON THE SIDE OF THE ON THE NURSERY AND NOW WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING LABELS ICE LIKE I SAID EARLIER THOSE LABELS NEED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE THEY'RE GOING. AND WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE SO. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP CONSERVE WATER IN THE STATE F CALIFORNIA WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THIS IDEA OF PUTTING A. LABEL ON A PLANT WILL HELP US GET THERE AND THEREFORE WE OPPOSED THE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHERS CURRENTLY NOT EMOTION IF ANY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE. BOOK. IT'S MADE BY MISTER CHIU. SECOND I MISS FRIEDMAN. I MISTER MATHIS. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROJECTED COSTS IS GONNA BE? FIT TO RUN ALL THIS NEW PROGRAM AND AND ALL THIS. WHEN YOU HAVE A COST ESTIMATE. I REALLY DO NOT I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF IN YOURSELF TO FIGURE THIS AGO CESAR HONOR THE. MY MY LARGEST CONCERN HERE IS. WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH WATER AND STATE. OF SEVERAL MEASURES GOING THROUGH. ON QUITE FRANKLY IN A IN YOU DON'T KNOW THE COSTA BEYOND BILL. WHICH IS DISTURBING IN ITSELF. WHY ARE WE LOOKING TO DO MORE PURPLE FIVE USE MORE RECYCLED WATER FROM THE FUNDING THEIR? THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED ONE OTHER OPTIONS OTHER THAN CREATING A BURDEN ON OTHER INDUSTRIES. IN MORE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT WE ALL KNOW IS. BEING ADDRESSED IN OTHER WAYS SO I MEAN YOU'RE NOT GONNA MY SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE I ENCOURAGE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH A FUNDING. FOR THINGS WE WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO TO CONSERVATIVE BE SMART WITH WATER BUT CREATING IN SPENDING MONEY ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WHERE THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ARE TRACKING? WE WE'VE GOT A CONSERVE ALL OUR RESOURCES. NOT SURE IF YOU WERE SITTING DOWN AND I DIDN'T REALIZE WHETHER YOU'RE HERE WHEN I WAS SPEAKING BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A CONTINUATION OF AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL THAT PASSED TWO YEARS AGO. IT'S ACTUALLY MAKING THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS A REALITY YES AND I I WAS HERE THE SORRY I DID DURING THAT TIME I DIDN'T SEE IN HERE THE ENTIRE TIME SO THIS IS ALSO. AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T OFTEN WORK TOGETHER. THAT HAVE COME TO THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY. INCLUDING A COALITION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS. IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A STATE. THAT ACTUALLY PUTS THE LAWS THAT THEY PLAN IN PLACE. AND THAT WE ARE CONSERVING WATER IN THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN SO PEOPLE CHECK OUT OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OF THE IN THE NEW ISSUE ON DISTRICT. I I WELCOME WORKING WITH YOU IN FIGURING THAT OUT SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHOI. NOW MY QUESTION NOW IS THAT THE I HEAR THE REQUIREMENT IS SO LARGELY PLACED ON THE NURSERY ASIDE AND THEN. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING I THINK IN THEIR SERIES. GENERALLY TONES START THE COMMITTEE AT THE RETAILER CELL AND THE FARMER SO REGIONALLY TAKE ROLL AND THE SOUTH NURSERIES. A I WONDER IF ARE THE ORIGIN ON A CULTIVATOR SO. OF FROM THE SEED THAT THEY CUT TO PAY THE UNPAID THOUGH MORE EXPORTS OF FOR THEM TO ORIGINATE TARA. THE LABEL ACCOUNTABLE WATER MAY BE. NECESSARY BECAUSE OF RECENTLY I BOUGHT A PLAN DAYS. IN OUR OUR SELDOM CAN FOR A PLANT THE BELOW MY WATER. MY HOPE FOUNTAIN AND GO. WHERE THEY MAY BE LACK OF US SON? SO OF US ARE LOOKING FOR. W. CLIMATE THE SUN Y. SHAPE THE WHERE THE PLANT CAN PATROL. AND THAT THEY OR NAY BUT THE BY THE COLLAR AND A NIGHT IT WAS ABLE TO CHOOSE THAT THE PROP ONE UNTIL. AFTER TWO THREE MONTHS IS STILL SURVIVING SO. I'M I MUST ABOUT THE HERE RIGHT TIED INTO. SO AS SUCH THAT THE ORIGINAL. IDEA COME FROM THE GERMINATION OF THE SEED COAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD KNOW BETTER. THE RATHER THAN PUTTING THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BRIDGE RETAILER ESSA. AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THEIR OWN RESEARCH. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE HOW YOU CAN SOLVE THE KIND OF PROBLEM. YES IF I MIGHT MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE THE BILL. THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL. BUT LARGELY SUPPLEMENT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN CURRENT LAW IN FACT MUCH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RELATING TO. TO LABELING ESERVER STATE IS A RESTATEMENT OF CURRENT LAW. BUT LABELS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED ON ON LANDSCAPE PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PRIMARY. AFFECT OF THIS BILL IS TO ADD THE WATER USE CLASSIFICATION. FOR THAT PLANT. TWO THE LABELING REQUIREMENT THAT IS ALREADY THERE. THAT'S PRIMARILY. THE AFFECTED THE BILL SO THOSE WHO ARE LABELING NOW WOULD CONTINUE TO LABEL WITH WITH. ADDING THE WATER USE DESIGNATION FOR THAT PLAN. ADMITTEDLY THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. SOME SOME. NUANCES ABOUT HOW A LABELING REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FASHION. THE BILL CALLS FOR FOOD NAG TO DO THIS THROUGH A RULE MAKING BY TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE IS TIME. WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WOULD BE A STAKEHOLDER. FRAMEWORK THAT FOOD NAG WOULD SET UP TO TO TAKE GUIDANCE FROM. INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW THE THE LABELING PROGRAM SHOULD BE SET UP. AND THAT AND I THINK YOU A TEACHER I WOULD HAVE MORE YEAH ADDITIONAL QUESTION HIM. IF I MAY ARE IS THAT. UNLESS OUT THAT IS SO SPECIFIC IN THE WAR PLANT. AND THE THE CONSUMER MAY PAY. A ATTENTION. AND THEN I I TEND TO OVER WATER AND A MY WIFE BUT TRUST ME TONE WATER UTILITY IN OFFICE SO SO IT'S AUTHORED THE COMMONSENSE SO WE WE LEARN AND A. BUT THE IF. A PLANTS I BY FOR OUTDOORS. AND OF THAT OR DIFFERENT KINDS. AND THE USUALLY WE WATER BASED UPON THE SEASON SOMETIME. IN A MORE FREQUENT THAT WINTERTIME MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IN IN GENERAL. SO STE REQUIRING SPECIFIC WATERMARK THE FULL OR DIFFERENT PLANS SO ON THE COTTON HOW THAT WOULD REALLY HELP OTHER THAN. IN ALL LABOR COSTA AND THEN IF EVENTUALLY THE CONSUMERS WILL END UP PAYING MORE. NO SEWER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WOULD BE REALLY. BENEFICIAL AND. SUBSTANTIALLY SAVED THE WATER SO. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE. DID THE MANDATED. ACOSTA FOR THE NURSERIES TO TO PROVIDE THAT KIND WHEN LABELS THAT'S MY CONCERN. IF I MAY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT PART OF IT IS ALSO EDUCATE EIGHT EDUCATING THE CONSUMER SO IF YOU'RE GONNA BUY. ROSES. THEY REQUIRE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WATER USE THEN A CACTUS. AND YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER. SO FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GARDEN IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT AND HOW YOU PLACE IT AND SO IF YOU ARE BUYING PLANTS THAT ALREADY TELL YOU WHAT THE WATER USES. THEN YOU'RE GONNA DIVIDE YOUR GARDEN BASED ON THAT WATER USE. AND YOUR NOT GONNA BE PUTTING. HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T BE PUTTING. FLOWERS NEXT TO OTHER TYPES OF PLANTS THAT ARE REQUIRED THE SAME WATER USE. AND THAT WAY YOU'RE ALSO SAVING WATERING YOUR WATER BILL. IN YOUR GARDEN CAN REFLECT A DIVERSITY OF. OF NATURE. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA THANK YOU SIR. MYSTERY THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I WAS. I'VE NAY APPRECIATE INVOLVEMENT IN THE SUPPORT OF UP OF THIS MY LOCAL AGENCIES FROM SAN DIEGO I WANT TO ASK YOU TO MAYBE RESPOND IN KIND OF THIS A LITTLE BIT ALREADY WITH MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS BUT TO WHAT MISTER BROWN WAS TALKING ABOUT. SEEM LIKE THERE'S SOME PRACTICAL CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THAT'S. WOULD PLAY OUT I'M I RECKON IT'S FAIRLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF BUT I AYE YEAH FINE MISTER BROWN BEASLEY PAID VERY THOUGHTFUL VERY PRAGMATIC. YOU TALK A LITTLE THAT WHAT HE RAISED IN WHAT HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND TO THOSE CONCERNS. WELL I'M HAPPY TO. TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST MOVE IT FORWARD AND ALSO WORK WITH OUR SPONSORS IN TERMS OF. RAISING SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND FIGURING IT OUT. AND I WAS ONE A PLAN FOR THE RECORD I I BELIEVE I SHARE MR MET HER MATHIS IS CONCERNS ABOUT. THE LACK OF FISCAL. RECOGNITION ON IT ARE ON THIS ITEM BUT IT'S TRUE OF EVERY ITEM THE AYE FOR WHITE MEN UNDERSTAND THIS PLACE WHERE ALL THE FISCAL IMPACTS ALWAYS IS UNKNOWN. I REALIZE AGAIN IT'S IN THE BEING THE PROCESS BUT I WOULD HOLD YOU PERSONALLY COUNSEL FOR THAT BECAUSE WITHOUT EITHER A BILLS TODAY THAT ALREADY HAVE THE SAME BUSINESS DOZEN NATIONS YOURS. THANK YOU. YEAH I MISS FRIEDMAN. THANK YEAH I'D WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THIS IS A LITTLE BIT PERSONAL TO ME. MY HUSBAND IS A LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR TO PROFESSIONAL LANDSCAPE DESIGNER. AND KNOWING ABOUT. THE THINGS I'D THIS BILL WOULD CODIFY ABOUT LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION ABOUT TO I'M THE TYPE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR HIS BUSINESS. AND I KNOW THAT NOT EVERY LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR ALWAYS HAS BEEN EDUCATED. OUR ARE IN IN THAT AREA I KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE MAKES A LOT OF MONEY GOING IN FIXING OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES. AND THE PERSON WHO ENDS UP REALLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF THAT ARE THE CONSUMERS. AND THE SAME WAY THAT CONSUMERS BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE FINANCIAL COST WHEN THEY GO TO A LANDSCAPE. THEY GO TO A NURSERY AND THEY UNKNOWINGLY BY SOMETHING THAT'S VERY WATER THIRSTY AND THE PLANT DIES YOUR LEADER. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL SAVE CONSUMERS MONEY. IT BY MAKING SURE THAT THE CONTRACTORS WHO WORK ON THEIR LANDSCAPES HAVE THE PROPER EDUCATION. FOR WHAT WE NEED. TO KEEP OUR LANDSCAPESHEALTHY WOULD EMIT DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND ALSO FOR HOMEOWNERS TO KNOW. WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE OF THE PLANTS THEIR PURCHASING AND HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEM? IT'S NOT DIFFICULT FOR NURSERIES TO PUT THIS INFORMATION ON LABELS SOME OF THEM DO IT TO GO TO HOME DEPOT FOR IT LIKE SHOULDN'T MENTION ANY PARTICULAR NURSERY. BUT THEY'LL PUT PLANTS IN THE AREAS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER USE BUT A LOT OF NURSERIES DON'T DO THAT. SO THIS IS A VERY THESE ARE VERY COMMON SENSE MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED RECENTLY BUT REALLY SHOULD BE ENSHRINED IN LAW AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY CONSUMER FRIENDLY SO. I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR ONCE AGAIN. THANKS WAS FRIEDMAN MISTER CHIU. UNSINKABLE MAJORITY SUPPORTED THIS BILL BECAUSE I. DO I DON'T SEE DOORS NO. ONE SOLUTION THAT WOULD REALLY IMPROVE TO YOUR. DATE THEIR WATER. CONSERVATION PURPOSE TOLD DISPEL WITCHES AND ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE CAN USE. I EVER HEARD A COMPLAINT I MEAN TO YOU THAT THE TESTIMONY FROM THE NURSERY. AND I FELT OF. THE ALTERNATIVE IS PROBABLY EVEN WORSE TO DAD NURSE BUT TO TO ADAPT BIRD SECTOR. OF DIVERSAS FOAM CALIFORNIA RUN OUT OF WATER. SO ARE WE ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RUBIO. THANK YOU WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR I'M A DID REACH OUT SEVERAL TIMES AND ARE THE AUTHORS OFFICE WAS VERY RESPONSIVE TO. TO THE THE QUESTIONS AND SO I DO AGREE WITHOUT MISTER GLORIA ABOUT CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE ISSUE FOR THE NURSERIES. BUT I CAN TELL YOU. DATA THE AUTHORS OFFICE WAS VERY RESPONSIVE SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUES TO SPEAKING TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION THANK YOU. SEEN NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE THE MEMBERS MISS CARILLO CHUCK CLOSE. THANK YOU A YES I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE SPELL ON THE FACT SHEET. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR ISSUES AND TO. MY COLLEAGUE FROM. BURBANK RAISES A REALLY. IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT SOME NURSERIES ALREADY DO THE LABELING. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS TO UNDERSTAND THE TYPE OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS THAT THEY'RE BUYING SO THAT THEY. AT THE END OF THE DAY SAVE MONEY AND SAFE WATER THAT IS REALLY THE INTENT OF OVER TRYING TO DO HERE. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR OPENING YOU ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE OF THE MET AMENDMENTS AND THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHAIRS TO PASS AS AMENDED. STICK AROUND BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SECOND BILL AFTER THIS. CALL THE. THE ROLE. XIN IS. THE MOTION IS TO. AMENDED TO THE. ABILITY AND. VIEW. EDUARDO GARCIA. GALLAGHER. BIGELOW. BIGELOW NO. CARILLO. I CARILLO AYE CHOI NAY. CHOI NO. CHIU ARE. CHIU HIGH. FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE HARPER. HARPER NO. KALRA. LEVINE AYE LEVINE AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NO. RUBIO. RUBIO I SAW LESS. WOULD. THE VOTE IS SIX FOR IT WILL REMAIN ON CALL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE AYE AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN NOW MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AGAIN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES THIS IS ESPECIALLY PERVASIVE. IN URBAN AREAS AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE CHILDREN HAVE LIMITED MEANS TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM OUTDOOR SPACES. IN MY FIFTY FIRST ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WE HAVE CHILDREN WHO LIVE MERELY FIFTEEN MILES AWAY FROM THE BEACH YET HAVE NEVER SEEN IT OR EXPERIENCE THAT. NO ONE SHOULD BE DENIED SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS SO CLOSE BY. ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS IN GENERAL HAS NUMEROUS BENEFITS FOR YOU THAT HELPS THEM GET MOVING AND ACTIVE. IN THE OUTDOORS AND PROMOTES HEALTH AND MOUNT MENTAL WELLNESS ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS CAN ENCOURAGE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. CURRENTLY MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SCHOOL BUSES THAT GO UNUSED ON THE WEEKEND. IN SOME CASES THESE BUSES CAN BE CONTRACTED TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THEM TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION. HOWEVER MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE AGENCIES ARE UNAWARE. OF THE AVAILABILITY OF SCHOOL BUSES TO TRANSPORT TO HELP OUR YOUTH GET TO OUR STATE PARKS AND OUTDOOR SPACES. FURTHERMORE NUMEROUS WORTHY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS OUR STATE AGENCIES LACK THE FUNDING AND MEANS NECESSARY TO SERVE OUR UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH. AMONG MANY OTHERS PARTICULARLY WHERE TRANSPORTATION IS CONCERNED. AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN WILL TASK THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WITH COMPILING A LIST OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CONTRACT. OUT THEIR SCHOOL BUSES TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE STATE AGENCIES FOR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THE AGENCY WILL THEN MAKE THOSE LIST AVAILABLE TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND STATE AGENCIES A PROVIDER DISADVANTAGED YOUTH WITH OUTDOOR. EXPERIENCES THIS WOULD CONNECT ORGANIZATIONS WITH TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO GIVE OUR TO SERVING YOU POSITIVE ENCOUNTERS WITH NATURE. AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN ALSO CREATES A GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS TO FOSTER MORE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. AND ENCOURAGE ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFER THESE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO DO SO USING LOW EMISSION BUSES. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS JOSE ONE SILENCE THE FOUNDER OF LATINO OUTDOORS AND HOLLY MARTINEZ OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HOLLY MARTINEZ DIRECTOR PROGRAMS AND ADVOCACY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE. PARKS FOUNDATION I'M HERE TO SPUR AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN. WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREATORS LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING THIS BILL TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIA'S DISADVANTAGED YOUTH. IT'S UNDENIABLE THE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES PROVIDED NUMBER OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND BENEFITS. CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION WE BELIEVE PARK EXPERIENCES ARE SUCH FOR HEALTH HAPPINESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST UNIQUE AND WORLD FAMOUS NATURAL RESOURCES AND STATE AND NATIONAL PARKS THAT DRAW THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS ANNUALLY. IT THE REALITY IS THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCES TREASURES THAT RESIDE IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. FOR MANY FAMILIES PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY THOSE OF MODEST ECONOMIC MEANS LACK OF RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION AND LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT PARKS AND OPEN SPACES. ARE OVERWHELMING BARRIERS. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS LANGUAGE ABILITY GENDER RACE CULTURE ZIP CODE. SHOULD HAVE ACCESS EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE BEAUTY. AND BENEFITS OF PARKS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE ONE OF THE MANY PATHWAYS. A PARKS THAT BEING TRANSPORTATION AVAILABILITY THROUGH SCHOOL DISTRICT BUS SUITES. THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS NONPROFITS AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE ACCESSING TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. AND THE NOW TELLING CALIFORNIANS OF MOBILE TO MOBILE GENERATIONS NOT JUST YOUTH TO THE OUTDOORS ON A REGULAR BASIS. AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN PROPOSAL FOR SURVEYING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UNDERSTAND THE BUS FLEETS. AND ESTABLISHING A NEW GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION ACCESS IS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARD HELPING MANY PARK PARTNERS WE WORK WITH. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALREADY DOING THIS IMPORTANT WORK. A POTENTIALLY EXPAND THEIR OUTDOOR PROGRAMMING TO SERVE MORE CALIFORNIANS. WE HAVE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT ASPECTS OF THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM ON THIS POTENTIAL PATHWAY TO GET MORE CALIFORNIANS OUTDOORS. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. HELLO. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME BECAUSE THEY WANT SILENCE I'M HERE WITH THAT THE NOT DOORS. AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN. FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS WILL FIRST OF ALL THAT THE NOT DOORS IS A PRETTY UNIQUE. AT THE NEXT LED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO DO WORK OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. IF THE SOME OF THE AREAS AND REGIONS IN WHICH THAT DIVERSITY OF LATINO COMMUNITIES. FOR WHICH I'M GONNA START THERE'S AT LEAST KIND OF THREE GIVEN THAT I SEE AND THAT KIND OF THREE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES INTO THIS BILL. PART OF THE GIVEN SAYS THAT. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF CONSERVATION STEWARDSHIP OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. OUGHT TO IS THAT I THINK THE RESEARCH IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT POSITIVE TRANSFORMATIVE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES ARE KEY. OTHER ESSENTIAL FOR ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD ARGUE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. IN CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE BEST PERIOD I MEAN TERMS OF STATE PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC LANDS AND EVERYTHING FROM CITY ALL THE WAY TO FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. SO THE THREE POINTS IS THAT. ONE OF THEM IS THIS QUESTION OF EQUITY AND INIQUITY GAPPING GOT AN AN AXIS. IT'S NOT NEW. BUT WE REALLY NEEDS REPORTS TO GET TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF THE MOST. EASY TO IDENTIFY SOMETIMES HARD TO TACKLE A BARRIERS IN TERMS VOWED TO ACCESS. SCHOOL DISTRICT TEND TO BE ONE OF THE BEST ASSETS AT A COMMUNITY HAS ANOTHER AN ANCHOR THEIR WELL KNOWN. HA. THE SECOND PIECE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CAN SERVICE THAT CONNECTION IN THE ABILITY TO GET MORE KIDS OUTDOORS NOT JUST HIM SOME MORE. KIDS SCHOOL CHILDREN BUT THE KIDS ARE SERVED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFITS THAT USUALLY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES ARE LIMITED LOGISTICALLY IT THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSPORTATION. THE SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE TO THE FINAL PIECES KNOWING THAT. TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE TRANSPORTATION PIECE WITH THE FUNDING QUESTION CAN BE PRETTY TRANSFORMATIVE AND REVOLUTIONARY BECAUSE THAT'S THE CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM. SO WE SEE THAT YOU KNOW THIS BILL. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR THE AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SIX FORTY. OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. COMMITTEE ON PUT ON THE ON BEHALF OF ONGOING CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY NATURE CONNECTION AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTER THE NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND SIN CREDIBLE IMPORTANT BILL IN SUPPORT.

MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SHAUN DRAKE FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION THE COMMISSION IS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY YET TO TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL HOWEVER IT WILL BE DOING SO LATER THIS WEEK AND STAFF WILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND A SUPPORT POSITION. A MARINE ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. REPORTING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STUCK HOUSTON REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERS CALIFORNIA PARK AND RECREATION SOCIETY AND THEN FINALLY THE OUTDOOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHERE ON SUPPORT. IT ANY ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SCENE AND I BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MR BICU. THANK YOU. I HAVE A. QUESTION UNDER SECTION ONE CODE FIVE SIX TWO OF THE BILL WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF OF LOW EMISSION BUSES. WELL I DON'T HAVE THE DEFINITION IN FRONT OF ME BUT HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT I THINK ARE OUR MAIN CONCERN PERFORMING GOAL IS THAT SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT'S WE MENTIONED EARLIER. ALREADY USE LOW EMISSION BUT. SO IF WE ARE TRYING TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO TO THE OUTDOORS TO CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT TO UNDERSTAND THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. OUR FIRST OPTION IS TO TRY TO USE THE LOW EMISSION BUSES OUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE CASE BUT IT SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRIORITY. RIGHT AND. BUTTON THOUGH EVERYTHING THAT I WAS ASKING IS. UP I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AND EVENTUALLY WITH YOUR OFFICE ABOUT INCLUDING. PROPANE BY SAYS AS PART OF THE LOW EMISSIONS ACCORDING TO THE RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD PROPANE IS A CLEAN COST EFFECTIVE A MEASURE SOLD THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN INCLUDE THAT AS PART OF. OF THE THE LIST OF WHAT I LOW EMISSION BUSES. I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT. MR BAYLOR. THANK YOU MAYBE FOR THE AUTHOR. MAYBE YOU COULD HELP IDENTIFY WHERE THE FUNDING COMES. FOR MEETING THE SHORT GAP AS YOU KNOW OUR STATE PARKS ARE. REALLY IN A DESPERATE. POSITION OF HAVING. NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. NOT GIVING THE FULL WRATH OF THE EXPERIENCE INTO OUR STATE PARKS THAT WE WOULD LIKE ALL THE USER TO HAVE ESPECIALLY THE DISADVANTAGE WHO CAN'T MAYBE MAKE ACCESS. TO A LOT OF THOSE AREAS BECAUSE ARE NOW CUT OFF. ARM. I'M WANTING IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO US HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL WHERE THE FUNDING WILL COME. FOR THE PROPOSED. IDEA SURE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING COSTS AS WELL. AND I THINK FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE FOR LOOKING AT POLICY THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND GOOD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AXES. AND ONCE IT GETS TO A A BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT WE COULD BEGIN TO ADDRESS MORE OF THE SERIOUS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION BUT WE SHARE YOUR CONCERNS. AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACCENTS TO TRANSPORTATION. FOR ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE THEY WANNA GIVE ACCESS TO YOUNG PEOPLE IT CAN TAKE. IT COST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RENT A BUS. TO TAKE KIDS FIFTEEN MILES. AND SO A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF FUNDING AND SO I HAVE ANOTHER. BILL IN CONCURRENT TO THIS THAT HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT THIS IS ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT THAT WOULD HELP. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. THE LISTS. OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ALSO. PROVIDE THE BUSES FOR ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT THERE COULD BE BETTER A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESS. SO COULD WE EXPECT. FROM YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOUR REQUEST WON'T HAMPER THE STATE PARKS OR THE PARKS THAT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS FROM. THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY DO DEL AND THAT THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. ELEMENTS WHICH ALWAYS GET PUSHED OFF TO THE BACK BURNER BECAUSE THERE'S NEW REQUIREMENTS PUT PLACED ON. CAN WE MAKE CAN WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM YOU THAT YOU WON'T BE A ATTACHING THESE FUNDS TO. TO THEIR EXISTING FUNDS. I HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY BEFORE I MAKE ANY TYPE OF COMMITMENT. BUT WE WANT TO WORK WITH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MOVE ACCESS FORT AND EQUITY FOR. OKAY SO I WOULD I WOULD WITHHOLD MY MY VOTE TODAY JUST BASED ON THAT TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR OFFICE TO MAKE SURE WE CAN GET THAT DONE. HAVING ONE OF THE DISTRICTS WHICH HAS MANY OF THE STATE PARKS AND IT IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THEM AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THAT THE FULL BEAUTY IN THE BOUNTY OF THE STATE PARK. TO ALL PEOPLE. I'M ON YOUR PAGE FOR THE DISADVANTAGE AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN INABILITY GET THERE AND I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUTH. IN OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE ABILITY ARE TO TRAVEL AND AND BE A PART OF THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL. AND AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE SCHOOLS AND RURAL AREAS HAVEN'T HAD THE ABILITY TO HAVE FUNDS. ARE AVAILABLE TO GO OUT AND BUY SOME OF THESE NEW MODERN BUSES AT THIS POINT. WHILE WHERE WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR IN HIS BUDGET HE'S MADE A LOT OF MONEY AVAILABLE BUT NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO COMPETE ON THE SAME LEVEL. AND MORE THE URBANIZED AREAS OF GOTTEN THOSE BUSES. VERSUS A RURAL MOUNTAINOUS AREAS SO THE KIDS WHO ARE THE CLOSEST TO THE STATE PARKS DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE IT AS MUCH AS THOSE ARE FARTHER AWAY. BUT IT GOING BACK TO THE BUDGET THE REAL BUDGET ISSUE HERE AND ACROSS TO YOUR BILL. DOES. APPROACH. A DIFFICULTY FOR OUR STATE PARKS TO PROVIDE THAT NECESSARY FUND. SAYS BECAUSE WHERE THEY'RE HAVING TO TRAIN THEIR BUDGET SO I'D BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU MY OFFICE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND FINING RESOLUTION TO THAT. THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW MISTER LIVING. YEAH THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISS KOREA FOR OFFERING THE BILL I LOVE THE BILL. NOW IT'S HARD TO BRING PARKS TO KIDS BUT WE CAN BRING KIDS TO PARKS AND OUT RELIGIOUS CHANGE. THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE NOW WHERE. HUGE POPULATIONS OF OUR STATE NEVER GET TO EXPERIENCE THE PARKING AND FEEL THAT THAT THAT INTERCONNECTEDNESS THAT WE HAVE WITH NATURE. AND THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF OUR STATE AND THAT THIS BILL REALLY HELPS US GET THEIR I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT TECHNICALITIES OF HOW WE DO IT BUT THE FACT THAT WERE. MARCHING FORWARD TO BRING THIS OPPORTUNITY. TWO CHILDREN AND I THINK CHANGING THEIR LIVES BUT ALSO CHANGING THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE BY. ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A CONNECTION TO THIS PLANET INTO TO THE STATE IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THIS IS THE OVERARCHING GOAL THAT WE SHOULD BE SHOOTING FOR. SO THANKS FOR OFFER ARE OFFERING THAT AND AND I'LL BE THERE TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. MISTER CHOI. MOTION BY MISS RUBIO SECONDED BY MISTER LEVINE. MISTER CHOI. OH I. THOUGHT I HAD A QUESTION BUT THAT THERE WAS A VERY SIMILAR ALREADY THAT HAS BEEN POSED DOT NOW REGARDING THE BUDGET ISSUE WHETHER. DE THE CREATION OF A NEW GRANT PROGRAM WHETHER YOU HAD US A SUDDEN SHE ENDINGS OF NO MIND ABOVE NOW BUDGET THAT. OR. AN APPLICATION DAYS IS IS NOT OPEN ENDED DOT THAT THOUGH YOU MAY NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ALL WELL ORGANIZATIONS WOULD APPLY FOR THAT A SOLO. WHETHER YOU HAD ANY UP. THEM BUDGET IDEA. CERTAIN. NEVER PLANNED SO FOR THAT THOUGH SO THAT WAS SO MCCONNELL RELATED. NAM BUT THAT I THINK IDEOLOGICALLY AS HAVE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL ANSWERS YOU CAN ADD THAT. WHETHER YOU HAD THE LOCK UP. MY NOSE TWENTY THOUSAND FIVE IN THOUSAND WHATEVER THAT YOU HAD A CERTAIN PROGRAM. AND THAT THE OTHER ONE IS THAT THERE ARE MANY SUCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES SO. MANY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO I KNOW UPON REQUEST A SIMILAR PROGRAM. GRANT PROGRAM L. WHEN YOU. ILL APPLY AND THE MANY LOCAL AGENCIES I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER RATHER THAN STATE MANDATED. AND ALSO AS YOU HEARD TELL OF A TRILLION DOLLAR SELF LOVE BEFORE THE MENTORS PROGRAM. AND THE ISSA ASSESSED SLICE OF OUR BUDGET. INFO WE SPEND AT THE INDIA THE ONE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER. SO. IT IS SANTA IN A BALANCING ACT. AND. BUT THEY YOU HAD THE SECTORS THAT CERTAIN SAID A MODEL PROGRAM AND SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP. IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BRING KIDS TO PARKS AS MENTIONED BY MISTER LEVINE PARKS CAN COME TO KIDS. SO WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO THAT THIS BILL IS ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. MR GARCIA I THINK YOU SCARED A TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AS I WENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND THE PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER. COLLECTIVELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER PARK BONTA. THIS WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUESTHAT WAS RAISED OF COURSE THE CONDITIONS OF OUR STATE PARKS ARE BOTH RURAL AND URBAN PARKS IN THE NEED TO. RENOVATE BUILD. WITH GREATER MAN SPACE RIGHT THE DEFICIENCIES THAT EXIST UP ANNOUNCED IN A CALIFORNIA TO THE OPEN SPACE. BUT THE GUY TRANSPORTATION GETTING ACCESS TO AND FROM WAS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WAS CAUSING REYES AND SO I COMMEND YOU. OFFER PUTTING THIS OUT PROPOSITION FORWARD WERE ASKING THE NATURAL RESOURCES TO DO AN ASSESSMENT. RIGHT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT A WILL THE POTENTIALLY REQUIRE US. TO HAVE OUR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS A PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN KIND OF EXPANDING THE EDUCATIONAL. YOU KNOW. ADVENTURES IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOOK IF IF WHILE I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A. MORE THOROUGH CONVERSATION THEN LET'S LET'S ASK OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO. SPECIFICALLY MAKE A COMMITMENT AND THE FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT WE SENT TO THEM. ARM TO SET ASIDE SOME SOME RESOURCES TO RUN THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS I'M FULL IN FAVOR OF. MOVING INTO THAT MAKES US PHASE OF THE CONVERSATION IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE HERE I REPRESENT. HAVE FOR MOST PARTY RURAL PART OF. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA COACHELLA IMPERIAL VALLEY AND THAT YOU KNOW BUSING IS THE LARGEST PART OF THEIR. A BUDGET YOU KNOW EXPENSE BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN. ASSURING THAT THEY'RE MAKING GOOD USE OF THESE BUSES. AND ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO VISIT JOSHUA TREE WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY FROM MY DISTRICT BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT. NINETY PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE RIGHT AND SO I I. COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COOPER WITH. I M.. I WAS GONNA SAY I SUPPORT THE MOTIVATION OF THIS BILL. I ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY I. WAS READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT. SOME KIDS FROM OAKLAND WHO ACTUALLY WENT UP TO MOUNT LASSEN. WHICH IS NOT IN MY DISTRICT AND. SALOON IN DALLAS DISTRICT BUT I'VE I'VE HIKED LASSEN I MEAN IT'S IT'S AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE TO BE STANDING ON THE TOP OF THAT. AND IT'S EXPERIENCE THAT YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO SEE AND. AND AND I THINK EVEN YOU EVEN MORE BROADLY LIKE. NEO SO MUCH OF PEOPLE IN OUR MORE URBAN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA GETTING OUT TO SEE BOTH. YOU KNOW THE SCENIC BEAUTY THE RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO SEEN YOU KNOW WHERE OUR RESOURCES COME FROM WHERE WATER COMES FROM WHERE AND. TIMBER COMES FROM WHERE IN OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. COME FROM I THINK YOU KNOW IT IS A GOOD THING SO I'M I'M SUPPORT OF I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AT TODAY THEM I THINK YOU HEARD SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT REALLY REVOLVE AROUND THE BUDGETARY ISSUES. AMONG THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE A KIND OF RESERVE MY VOTE THERE BECAUSE I THINK WE DO NEED TO WORK TO BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS ADD TO. WHAT IS ALREADY A PROBLEM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC WHICH IS A NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND? I THINK MAYBE THERE'S WAYS TO GET THERE THERE IS SOME MONEY I KNOW AVAILABLE THROUGH. THE RECENT AIR RESOURCES BOARD HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR UPGRADING BUSES SO MAYBE THAT COMPLAIN TO THIS AS WELL AND. SO WITH THAT I'LL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS DAY BECAUSE I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOOD THING WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO GET MORE MORE PEOPLE OUT INTO OR OUT DOORS ENCOURAGE THAT. IT'S HUGE FROM A TOURISM STANDPOINT I THINK IT'S JUST GOOD FOR. BEING A WELL ROUNDED PERSON RIGHT. SO. THAT SUPPORT THAT BUT LET'S TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE FISCALLY SHE'S RIGHT. OKAY AT WITH THAT. YET HIS REGULAR. TO THE TO THE CHAIR. THROUGH THE CHAIR TO THE CHAIR. ON CENTER THE CO AUTHOR OF THIS AND I I KNOW I ASKED. THE AUTHOR OF THIS SO I I THOUGHT I HEARD. AND EXPRESS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES ON THE BUDGET. SIDE OF IT SO WE CAN FIND THE FUNDING AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT TOUCH ON MY HEART A GREAT DEAL. I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND POLICY. TO KEEP MOVING AND KEEP WORKING ON ON RESOLVING THESE ISSUES BUT. AS I TO SIT IN APPROPRIATIONS ALL HAVE TO RESERVE THAT AT THAT MOMENT. BUT I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH BOTH OF YOU SO IF THERE'S A COMMITMENT THERE I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON TRYING TO PUSH THIS FORWARD BOOK THAT MOST DEFINITELY AT. THERE'S A CAPTAIN YOU'RE LEADING THE PACK HER SOLELY. I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE GOT EVERYTHING ENDS OF COMMITMENT I GOT YOUR SENSE THOUGH I I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ARE WITH THAT WILL. CALL THE ROLL THAT IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS. THE MOTION IS PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM SO I JUST WANNA AT MAKE SURE THAT WE THOSE ARE CLEAR THAT ONE IS REALLY LOOKING AT TRANSPORTATION AND ONE IS A GRANT PROGRAM. MORE HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE JUST LIMITS TRANSPORTATION. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATIONS TO GIVE PRIORITY FOR FUNDING FOR OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTHERN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT PRIMARILY THAT PRIMARY TARGET UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. AT CALIFORNIA HAS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY STATE PARKS AND MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND THAT EXHIBIT THE NATURAL BEAUTY AND HISTORY OF OUR STATE IN ADDITION TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

WE TEND TO USE THE WORD UNDERREPRESENTED BUT REALLY IT'S KIND UNDERSERVED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT OUR VOLUNTEER LEADERS PROVIDED SENDS AN OUTING OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE. THERE'S HOW THE LOGISTICAL AND TECHNICAL ASPECT THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE. I'M AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY TO THE STATE. AND MY FIRST TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE WAS IS IN CALAVERAS THAT BIG TREES. HOUSE I GREW UP IN TURLOCK RIGHTS MACINNES AND CENTRAL VALLEY I DO NOT KNOW I HAD SUCH MAJESTY JESS AND OUR TWO AWAY AND GET OUT TO ASSEMBLY UNTIL I WAS IN COLLEGE EVEN THOUGH THAT'S ALSO. TWO PLUS HOURS AWAY. IN HAVING THOSE EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED NOT JUST BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO GO ON MY OWN OR BECAUSE MY PARENTS COULD ACTUALLY JUST TAKE ME. IT HAPPENED WITH COMMUNITY SUPPORT COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOOLS YEAH IT GOT THERE. THROUGH THE HELP OF OUR. ORGANIZATION THAT WAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OUTREACH CATION ON A SCHOOL BUS. IN THIS OUTING EXPERIENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. FOR US IN TERMS OF A LATINO IDENTITY AND CULTURE. FIRST OF ALL IT'S WELCOME TO EVERYBODY SO THERE'S NO EXCLUSIVITY AROUND THAT JUST TO BE CLEAR. BUT KNOWING THAT. THAT LEADERSHIP IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TAKING OUT IS CRUCIAL AND IMPORTANT. BECAUSE BOTH OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO FEEL LIKE IF THEY CAN REPRESENT THE FULL SELVES. AND THEY'RE GOING AN OUT EXPERIENCES WITH THOSE THAT ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT LIVED EXPERIENCE. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MYSELF A A MODEL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND AND YOU A CITIZEN. I IN A WAY THAT I CAN. NAVIGATE THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL OUTDOOR CONSERVATION SPACE. BUT ALSO ABLE TO LEVERAGE MEDINA IDENTITY TO A BIT MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS AND BRIDGE THAT NOTHING THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BEING ABLE TO SUPPORTING CREATE MORE AND THE CULTURAL LEADERS. THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO BRIDGE THIS. AND. YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL MANY EXAMPLES WHERE EXISTING PROGRAMS INFRASTRUCTURE MAKES IT DIFFICULT NOT TO DO THIS. ARE WE ALREADY KNOW FROM BEFORE A. B. AT THIRTEEN THIRTY. ALSO THE ACADEMIC IMPACT THAT OUT TO EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE. AND SO HAD KNOWING THAT THE OUTDOOR SUPPLY OF ACADEMIC. ESPECIALLY SCIENCE GAINES. CULTURAL CONNECTION BUT ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT THE. STEWARDSHIP COMPONENT AND NOT JUST BE ABLE TO GO AND APPRECIATE OUR STATE OUR PUBLIC LANDS STATE AND FEDERAL AND STATE PARKS BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE WHAT IS IT TAKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S. WHAT'S BEING HERE BEYOND THE EXPERIENCE OF TRUMP THE LANDSCAPE THE PRESERVATION THE STEWARDSHIP NOT A CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. SO THAT'S WHY. CONTACT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON FOR LEADERSHIP IN THIS IN AS THE COMMITTEE FOR SUPPORTING AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR. HA BECAUSE WE NEED THIS KIND OF PROCESS AN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FUNDING SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THERE WAS THOSE EARLY TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOWED ME TO BE WHERE I AM TODAY AND BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT I DO IN SERVICE OF THAT SO THANK YOU. BOTH THE BUREAU.

GOOD MORNING LEN ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF BOOKS ARE LATIN LAND TRUST AND SANTA CLARA VALLEY OF THE SPACE OF THIRTY AND SUPPORT THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING RECALL MONSTER TO NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. IN SUPPORT I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP ON ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OF GIVING DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE. AN OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE IN THIS IS ANOTHER BILL THAT LEADS TO A WELL ROUNDED HUMAN BEINGS. MISTER CHAIR MARK FRENCH MAKER BEHALF OF THE WILDLINGS CONSERVANCY AND SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE AND SUPPORT. WHAT ELSE? WISHING. ANYONE OPPOSITION. ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I STARED. YEAH AND NOW IT'S OUT OF YOUR HERE FOR THE PREVIOUS VOWED TO MAKE THE SAME CAVEAT I MEAN DEFTLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT AND I THINK WE JUST NEED TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE FISCAL ISSUES AND. AND CERTAINLY WE WANT PEOPLE TO GO TO WE WANT PEACE. EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT PARKS AND HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE PARKS ARE WELL MAINTAINED SO. I THINK IT'S TRYING TO WORK THROUGH AND FIGURE OUT THE FISCAL ISSUES GOING FORWARD IS IS REALLY THE ISSUE. FOR SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT I JUST KIND OF I'M GUESSING AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S QUESTION MIGHT BE AROUND AT THAT A TOPIC AND YES WE I THINK IT THERE IS AN AGREEMENT. THAT AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR PARKS. ARE ALREADY AN IMPORTANT AND I THINK ASSET TO OUR STATE AND SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR TAX HEAVILY AND THEY HAVE. DONE IT AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET TO DO THIS BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO KIND OF EXPLORE THIS I'M IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PREVIOUS FEEL THAT YOU JUST HEARD. AWARE ALSO COMMITTED TO LOOK AT ELENI ELIGIBLE SPECIAL FUND RESOURCES WHETHER AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FIND OR. AND YOU KNOW THE SPECIAL PARKS AND REX I FIND SO WE ARE AT COMMITTED TO EXPLORING HOW WE WOULD MAKE THIS A REALITY AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT IN THE POLICY LEVEL BUT ABSOLUTELY. UNDERSTAND THAT THE FISCAL IMPACT ON AND THE ABILITY TO DO THIS IS REALLY I'VE PENDING ON WHERE THE RESOURCES I COULD COME FROM WITH OUT. ALREADY AND YOU KNOW TAXING. A VERY LIMITED SOURCE OF FUNDS. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I A I DO. I WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO GO ANYWHERE UNTIL LATER IN LIFE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE. UP WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS AND THINK FOR BEING THE BILL FOR THE. SOME MEMBER BILL. I WAS JUST GONNA WANNA MAKE SURE I I THINK YOU'VE ADDRESSED THE QUESTION BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT. THE STATE PARKS ARE FUNDED IN THREE MECHANISMS GENERAL FUND USER FEES AND FROM STATE US SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THE SPECIAL FUNDS CAN BE A PLETHORA OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FROM RENTING STATE LANDS AND AND WHAT ARE NOT. THE REAL THE REAL CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT TAKING FROM OTHER FEES AND OTHER FUNDS. WE'RE HAMPERING THEIR ABILITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO THE GENERAL FUND BECOMES. THE SOLE SOURCE FOR REALLY THE NEXT ALL OF FUNDING THING IT'S JUST GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO IDENTIFY. HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE FUNDS FROM THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE PROGRAMS SUCCESSFUL ON WITH? MISTER GALLAGHER AND AND MANY THE MEMBERS AROUND HERE AND WITH YOU IN CONCEPT WE WANT TO GET THE EXPERIENCE THERE SO. I WANNA BE SUPPORTIVE I JUST WENT OVER THE FUNDS ARE COMING FROM SO I CAN GET THERE AND WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU WE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S WHAT SOMETHING THAT IS NEEDED. AND THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE WE DON'T WANT TO I'D JUST THINK OF THAT YOU KNOW JUST GENERAL FUND ITSELF AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER SPECIALS THAT WERE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO TRY TO WORK. ON THIS IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. NEW QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE MOTION BY SOME OF CHIU AND MRS RUBIO CLOSING COMMENTS EXPECT LAST WHEN I HAVE IT RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AT CLEARLY THERE SEEMS TO BE A. A TREND HERE RIGHT THAT THAT WERE WANTING TO BRING GREATER AXES TO. UNDERSERVED UP POPULATIONS OF THE STATE TO OUR OUTDOORS AND. LOOK WE WE'VE MADE A A SUBSTANTIAL REQUEST OF. ARE BUDGET CHAIRS AND. THIS GOVERNOR TO INVEST IN OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCIES. WE'VE MAY REQUEST IN THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF MONIES THAT ARE BEING GENERATED FROM THE HAD GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINE AND WE THINK THAT. THESE TYPES OF PRIORITIES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED MERIT. YOU KNOW A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AND SO THERE IS NOT ONLY THE POLICY. DELIBERATION THAT WE'RE HAVING BUT I THINK THERE ARE AVENUES TO FUND THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND IF JULIE. I THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THIS BODY FOR THIS COMMITTEE I AM WERE HAPPY TO GENERATE. LETTER GET SOME SIGNATURES ON IT AND A RESUBMIT SOMETHING TO YOU KNOW THE BUDGET CHAIRS AND ALL THE WAY. THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LINE AGAIN THE POLICY WITH THE RESOURCES.

REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT OF WILD PIGS THIS MEASURE WAS DEVELOPED FROM RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY A REPORT FROM THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION AFTER SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. THAT WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WILD PIGS ARE A NON NATIVE INVASIVE SPECIES RESIDING IN FIFTY SIX OVER FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IMPORTANTLY THIS MEASURE WILL HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. BETTER MANAGE WILD PIGS AND MITIGATE THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE TO LANDOWNERS. AND ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I'M. WORKING AND ALSO WORKING WITH MY STAFF I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE VOLUNTARY REPORTING FOR THE TAKE OF A WILD PIG. JOINING ME TODAY IS MISTER ROY GRIFFITH. WITH TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF GAME WARDEN EXPERIENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND WELL KRAMER'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. AND OUTFIT FEDERATION AND I'M SORRY MARKET WE CAN MARK WATERFALL THANK YOU MARKEDLY FROM THE WATER FELL. MEMBERS. WHEN IT'S TIME I WOULDA RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. BILL. SECOND. VERSA WHAT. RIGHT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE AND AS. SOON A MEMBER BIGELOW SAYS MY TIME WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT I. DEVELOP A FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIG PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE DAMAGE TO HABITAT ON THEIR DIRECT COMPETITION WITH NATIVE WILDLIFE. I REPRESENTS THE RPA THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND THAT'S OUR GOAL IT'S YOUR PA TO. TO TURN AS MANY THESE DEPREDATION PIGS AND A HARVESTABLE PICKS AS POSSIBLE. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MISTER BIGELOW ON THIS. THIS BILL AND IT IS A GOOD VEHICLE FOR DOING THAT. IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE PIGS ARE HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER GAME ANIMAL AT THEM IN THE SAME TIME THEY CREATE. YOU KNOW AND PROVEN DAMAGE TO HABITAT. THE PIGS ARE LOCATED IN FIFTY EIGHT A FIFTY SIX OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY BRING IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN REVENUE FOR THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE TICKET PURCHASES SELLS THESE TAGS. HOWEVER SWITCHING FROM THE PIG TAG TO PICK STAMP WE BELIEVE WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE REVENUE WE BELIEVE WILL INCREASE ACCESS FOR THE EVER AVERAGE HUNTER TOO. EASY MORE EASILY ARE HOT AND HARVEST THESE PIGS. SO OUR. PLAY. ARE WE REALLY. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT TO WILD THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR TWO WAS THE OUT WILDLIFE RESOURCE COMMITTEE. AND. THAT HAS BEEN VETTED FOR OVER A YEAR SO REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING NO KRAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I WON I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. DEALING WITH WILD PIGS ARE NON NATIVE AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE BOTH THE PRIVATE PROPERTY IN OUR STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT A VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S. INTERESTS ARE CONSIDERED AND WE COME UP WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTION. AND WE THINK. AB TWENTY TO FIVE A WILL ULTIMATELY DO THAT THERE'S STILL A FEW TWEAKS THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE AREN'T ANY IMPACTS ON OUR DOMESTIC. PORK PRODUCTION IN THROUGH THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS A WILD PIG. BUT WE THINK THAT THIS BILL BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT FOR OUR MEMBERS TO GET A DEPREDATION PERMIT FOR THESE PIGS THAT ARE CAUSING DAMAGE. WILL BE HELPFUL IN TRYING TO ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE POPULATION AND ON MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF WILD PIGS AND WE WOULD URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. AND THERE MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL. YOU REALLY LIKE THE ARE RECENT CHANGES TO THE BILL. ARE THE BILL REDUCES THE PIG FOR A TAG OR EXCUSE ME PIC VALIDATION TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS WHICH HELPS ADDRESS COSTS COST IS A BARRIER TO HUNTING FOR SOME OF OUR MEMBERS. ON THE FUNDING GENERATED ALSO STILL GOES TO OUR BIG GAME MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT WHICH VERY IMPORTANT. SUPPORTING CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. AND WE. ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE DE LINKAGE TO THE SHARE PROGRAM THAT'S A PRIVATE LANDS ACCESS PROGRAM. THAT PROVIDES A PUBLIC CUNNEEN OPPORTUNITIES ON FARM AND OTHER PRIVATE LANDS ALL DONE IN A LANDOWNER FRIENDLY WAY IT'S A WIN WIN FOR FARMERS AND SPORTSMEN SO. WE APPRECIATE THAT LINKAGE AND URGE YOU TO SUPPORT BACK ON THANK YOU ANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THE BILL AT MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE MEMBERS POLIO TO SHUDDER AND TO HAVE THE PLEASURE COUNTY BOARD SOUP RIGHTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL NEXT. JIM WHAT A MEASURE CHAIRMAN. JIM WATERS WITH GAINS IN ASSOCIATION GAINES AND ASSOCIATES LIKE TO REPRESENT THE. THE CALIFORNIA WETLAND IN WATER FELL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA OF. HUNT BOWMAN HUNTERS IN STATE ARTERY ASSOCIATION THE BY A PRACTICE. BACK. BLACK BRANT A GROUP. AND THE SUSAN RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT PURCHASE SUPPORT. WHAT ELSE? OKAY ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. WANT TO SPEAK. THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEWARD DOLLAR. AND REPRESENTING THE MODESTO HELMSMAN. AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT UNSYMPATHETIC TO PROPERTY OWNERS. AND THE LOW. LAND DAMAGING PROPERTY. TO LOS TO THEIR CROPS. WE'RE STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. BECAUSE. WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION OF WILD PIG IS IN THE STATE. THERE HASN'T BEEN A STEADY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. TO ESTABLISH HOW MANY PIGS THERE ARE IN THIS STATE. DO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN. TAKE DROPPED BY EIGHT POINT THREE PERCENT. SO WE'RE REALLY ASKING THAT A MANAGEMENT STUDY. BE ENACTED BEFORE. WE CHANGE. THE CURRENT STATUS. OF THE PIG AS A BIG GAME ANIMAL TO AN EXOTIC AND WHAT IN THE WORLD AS AN EXOTIC MEAN ANYWAY. MEAN WEBSTER DICTIONARY DESCRIBES THAT AS A STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT. ARE. A DISTINGUISHING. UNUSUAL ANIMAL. AND. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS GOING TO DESCRIBE A FERAL PIG HAS STRIKINGLY UNUSUAL. ALSO WITHIN THIS BILL THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR THE USE OF DOGS NOW THAT'S MY PATIENT AS A HOUND MEN. AND THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR THE USE OF DOGS. EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS BY ANY MEANS. EVERY TIME IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUND. WERE LEFT SHORT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING. THAT YOU COULD. TWO OF THE WITNESSES DOT DOT MANY OF CO CHAIRMAN OF THE COALITION OF ALL. ODDS CHAPTERS OF ASCII AS WELL AS CHAPTER PRESIDENT OF SACRAMENTO SUPPORT A CLUB. WE OPPOSE THE GAME STATUS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM WILD PIGS. BUT A GAME STATUS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN. IT'S A VIABLE AFFORDABLE BANG FOR A CALIFORNIANS TO HAUNT. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WAS THE LAST SURVEY DONE. THIS YEAR WE HAVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PUT INTO THE BUDGET FOR. FISHING WILDLIFE I THINK THAT THEY COULD DO A STUDY TO TELL US WHETHER WE HAVE TOO MANY YOU NOT ENOUGH WHERE. OF PICKED BOB PROBLEMS OCCUR AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE MANAGED. OF. BECOME WILDLIFE IS WHAT. SHOULD BE CONTROLLING OUR. WHILE I POPULATION AND THEY HATED IT SHOULD ARE. TITLE TO BE DOING THEIR JOB. KATHY LYNCH REPRESENTING OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN'S COALITION OF CALIFORNIA BE VERY BRIEF. I DID PARTICIPATE AT THE WRC AT THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. HOWEVER THAT PROCESS WAS THAT. AS WAS POINTED OUT A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE LAST WILD PIG MANAGEMENT STUDY THAT WAS DONE WAS DONE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE UP A COPY OF IT HERE I ACTUALLY HAD ASKED THE DEPARTMENT FOR A COPY THEY HAD TO DIG IT OUT OF THEIR ARCHIVES. THIS WAS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED IN THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE WRC IN THIS IS. THAT THIS WAS A FIVE YEAR PLAN AT THE TIME AND THERE'S A STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS SECTION FORTY SIX FIFTY ONE OF THE FISH AND GAME CODE. THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO A MANAGEMENT PLAN SO WHILE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OBJECTIVE THAT MISTER BIGELOW IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WERE ALSO SUPPORTIVE. OF. AGRICULTURE HAVING RELIEF FROM DEPREDATION WE DO NOT SEE MERIT IN REMOVING THE GAME STATUS WE THINK THE GAME STATUS SHOULD BE PRESERVED. YOU CAN LOOSEN UP THE DEPREDATION REQUIREMENTS. AND SINCE THAT WAS REFERENCED THAT THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY FROM THE PIC TAG PROGRAM IT SEEMS ONLY REASONABLE THAT THE MONEY BE USED FOR PEGS AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT PLAN BE UPDATED. THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR DEPARTMENT OR COMMISSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FROM. ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SUMMER MATH. MISTER BIGELOW I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT BILL HERE LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. SAUCE. THANK YOU AT THINK RECIPROCAL LARGE SAID A COUPLE OF. QUESTION IF YOU JUST COMMENT ON SOME OF THE. POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING KNOW EITHER WORK WITH THEM OR ARE YOU BE ON THAT PLANE AND THE BILL IS WHAT IT IS. FETCHED LIKE UPDATE ON ON THOSE EFFORTS PLEASE THE LATTER POINT WERE ALWAYS WILLING TO WORK WITH WITH FOLKS TO TRY TO RESOLVE AND GET THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE. FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT THE THE DOGS AND HOUNDS. TO BE ABLE TO HIDE WE'RE NOT TOUCHING ANY PART OF THE BILL THEY HAVE THE SAME EXISTING RIGHTS THAT THEY'VE HAD. FOR AS LONG AS THEY'VE HAD RIGHTS TO HUNT THERE NAMED IN ANOTHER SECTION OF THE LAWS A WEEK WE ARE SILENT ON THAT IN THIS BILL BECAUSE THE IT ALREADY EXISTS THERE'S NO NEED TO. APPROACH THAT WITH RESPECT TO. MS LYNCH'S A COMMENTS I THINK WHERE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HER AND ADDRESS A AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AT SOME POINT YOU JUST HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ITS TIME TO MOVE ON. AND PUT A BILL FORD I THINK WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDIES THOUGH AND WE LOOK AT THE REALITIES THERE'S A NUMBER BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ONE MILLION EXISTING PICKS. THAT EXISTS BE AND FIFTY SIX OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TODAY. THE HARM. THAT'S BEING DONE TO BOTH FARMING. PRIVATE LINES PRIVATE YARDS. TO OUR GOLF COURSES IS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FAR MORE THAN THE FIND GENERATES INPUTS BACK. TO MANAGE I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. WITH THIS AS IT'S OUTLINED TODAY I WOULD ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THAT THINK MISTER REGLA I'LL TRUST YOUR FORCES THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. LOOK FORWARD TO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE BUT. YES. BUT TRUST JUNE THE JEWEL FULFILL AND WORK THROUGH THOSE EFFORTS I WILL AND IF ONE NOTE JUST FOR EVERYONE. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IT DEPICTS CAN REGENERATE EVERY THREE MONTHS THREE WEEKS AND THREE DAYS. ARE THE AVERAGE SIX PIGLETS IN THE WILD. OTHERS MORE THAN TEN. AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING I'M IN A I DOMESTICATED LA OUTCOME SO YOU CAN LITERALLY TAKE THE POPULATION. AND TRIPLE IT EACH YEAR. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. EVEN IF YOU TOOK SEVENTY PERCENT. AS A KILL RATE. YOU STILL HAVE YOU WILL BE GAINING IN THE POPULATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE BEFORE ALREADY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THAT MAGIC NUMBER OF. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A MILLION HAD. WE HAVE A CRISIS PROBLEM WITH OVERPOPULATION AND DAMAGE THAT'S CAUSED BY THEIR ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU MISTER JOURNAL SOME NUMBER A KALRA HAS QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK YOU SOME OF THE SUMMER BIGELOW I BELIEVE IT OR NOT AT BEING IN SAN JOSE INFORMATION MIGHT MEMBER THIS WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES. WITH WHILE PICKS. UP TO CLEAN THE SOUTHERN PART OF OUR CITY AND AND COMING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS WITH YARDS IN OUR CITY PARKS WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT. I'M I ALSO WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS MOVES FORWARD AND CERTAINLY OF DFW COMING UP BUT THE MANAGEMENT PLAN I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL PUT INPUT INTO AND ALSO HERE FOR SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE CONCERNS AS WELL BUT. I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING YOUR TIME MANAGING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PREVIOUS MEMBER THAT REPRESENT THE AREA. TO FONG WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE. AND AND OTHERS FROM THE AREA HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IN THE PAST AS I'VE TRIED WORK IT THROUGH AND MY CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM THEM CONTINUES NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. NO QUESTIONS. OKAY THERE'S A MOTION BY SUMMER MATHIS AND SOME MEMBER RUBIO. TAKE THAT AS A CLOSING THANK SIR MEMSIC TRIP PLEASE CALL ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA GARCIA AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE BIGELOW. I BIGELOW AYE CARILLO. CHOI ARE AYE CHOI AYE CHU. TO AYE FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN AYE GLORIA. HARPER. BOB. HERTZBERG NOT VOTING. KALRA.

MS YOU MOVES. YOU'D THINK. ALONE. YOU. I WAS ACTUALLY CAUGHT UP HERE BECAUSE I. DIDN'T. IS FILE WATER BUT I DID CALL THEM UP THAT'S MY. MISTAKE I POLITICS. BUT VERY BIG IF THIS YEAR IS GOOD MORNING. ACHIEVEMENT MEMBERS. I. THESE PEOPLE PLEASE BE BRIEF. I WILL BE BRIEF. FOR TWENTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A STEADY HAS SEEN A STEADY DECLINE OF HUNTERS THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE BECAUSE SENATOR KITA WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION EFFORTS ON THE REVENUE THEY GENERATE. WE COULD NOT MANAGE OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE RESOURCES. THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY COMPLIMENTING SEED THAT DFW IS ONGOING CONTRA RECRUITMENT RETENTION REACTIVATION EFFORTS. PATHETICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH TO FREE HUNTING DAYS PER YEAR WHERE AN UNLICENSED HUNTER CAN GO OUT AND HUNT JUST FOR THAT DAY ONCE A YEAR WITH A LICENSE UNDER. THE IDEA ORIGINATED WITH SENATOR HOLLINGS WORTH IN TWO THOUSAND TEN HIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE DIRECTOR OF CDF W. TO DECLARE FREE HUNTING DAYS IN THE FALL AND IN THE WINTER. WAS MODELED ON CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING FREE FISHING DAYS UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE BILL PASSING UNANIMOUSLY CDF W. HAS YET TO DECLARE A SINGLE FREE HUNTING DAY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE DIRECTOR DECLARE TO SUCH DAYS PER YEAR. ASSET FOURTEEN SENATOR HOLLINGS WITH LEGISLATION TO PARTICIPATE ONE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A LICENSE AN EXPERIENCED HUNTER AND IT COMPLETED A HUNTER SAFETY EDUCATION OUR COURSE HERE TO. TESTIFY AS TO THE BENEFITS OF A FREE HUNTING DAYS I HAVE WITH ME MARC HEADLEY OF THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND REALLY GRIFFITH OF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE BILL. I MISSED CHAIR MARKEDLY CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION TWAS THE TWENTY THOUSAND MEMBER NONPROFIT DEBT CARRIES OUT HUNTER EDUCATION RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ESSENTIALLY TO TRY BEFORE THEY BUY WITH THEIR HUNTING LICENSE HUNTING LICENCES AND. IN CALIFORNIA I AM AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE OF ANY STATE WE KNOW THAT COSTS CAN BE A BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION INITIALLY. SO THIS BILL HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT. AS WAS. MENTIONED EARLIER BY PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE BEHIND THIS IS GOING TO COMPLIMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S HUNTER RECRUITMENT. RETENTION REACTIVATION PROGRAMS. AND THEN. BY DOING THAT AND GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE OUTDOORS AYE IT'S CAN ALTERNATELY GENERATE MORE FUNDING FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GENERATED THROUGH HUNTING FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES. AND THEY'RE ALL JUST OUT ONE. QUICK THING DOWN THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT DELAYS IMPLEMENTATION TELL JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE THAT SHE GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THE SET UP. SO THANK YOU. READY. GOOD MORNING WHICH GERMAN MEMBERS ROY GRIFFITH AS. BOB WITH CALVIN RIFLE PISTOL SOCIALISM BUT TODAY I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HUNTERS CONSERVATION COALITION WHICH IS COALITION OF MANY OF AND OUR MEMBERS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AS MARK MENTIONED HUNTING BILLING BRINGS IN A HUNTING LICENSE ALONE OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. COMBINED THAT WITH TAG SALES TWENTY SIX MILLION. PITTMAN ROBERTSON DOLLARS ELEVEN PERCENT EXCISE TAX THAT HUNTERS PLAY ON THE SPORTING GOODS AND AMMUNITION BRINGS ANOTHER FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR CONSERVATION EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA. SORIANO HUNTERS HAVE TAKEN CARE OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT. THE GOVERNOR EVEN RECOGNIZE THIS BILL AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE OUR THREE AFTER RECRUITMENT RETENTION REACTIVATION TO THE POINT THAT HE MENTIONED IN THE BUDGET IS LINE ITEMS. THAT ARE IN SPENDING CONSERVATION EFFORTS IMPROVING HUNTING AND FISHING PARTICIPATION AND CONNECTING MORE CALIFORNIA WITH THE OUTDOORS IN THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT. HUNTERS TO PAY THEIR PART AND IT'S IT'S TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND GET MORE INVOLVED AS MARK MENTIONED TRIBE FOR DIVIDE IS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER STATES. SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT BUT NOT IMPLEMENTING THAT HERE. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE NUMBERS AND JUST BEEN GOING DOWNHILL FOR YEARS SO REALLY ENCOURAGE. YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR GIVEN BONUSES CHAIR OF PRIVILEGES TAKEN SOME GOOD NOTES ON YOUR BILL INTO. SMALLER RECOGNIZE AT DOES ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. OF THIS MEASURE PLEASE BRIEFING. TO THE POINT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS JIM WATER IN HER REPRESENTING GAINES AND ASSOCIATES.

LAURIE JACOBS WILL CALIFORNIA HOUNDS ON FOR CONSERVATION WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION XENON I DO HAVE A COLLEAGUE QUESTION. THANK YOU CHAIR SO THE STATE IS ABLE TO. AUTHORIZED OR DESIGNATE THESE DAYS DID YOU INQUIRE AS TO WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND WELL. I WE DID AND THAT THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO DO SO BUT I KNOW THEY DIDN'T PROVIDE A REASON. AND. YOU TALK ABOUT THE. OR. TESTIMONY INCLUDED THE COST OF THE. ORDER THE HOUSES THE COST OF THAT THE LICENSE IN SAYING THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE OR AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUT WE ALSO HAVE. A EXPENSES THAT WE TRY TO COVER. UP IN THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE LICENSE FEES AND SO WE TRY TO RECOUP WHAT THOSE ACTUAL COSTS WOULD BE SO WHETHER IT'S EXPENSIVE OR NOT WE HAVE ACTUAL COST TO DO THE JOB OF DFW. THAT YOU KNOW HELP SET WHAT THAT HE WOULD BE RIGHT SO YOU COULD SAY IT'S EXPENSIVE OR ACTUALLY. TRIES TO JUST RECOVER ARE REAL COSTS I THINK YOU'RE MAKING MY POINT THAT I THAT THOSE OUT FUNDS ARE NEEDED I TO FUND THESE EFFORTS BY. THE INITIAL BARRIER TO ENTRY. KEEPS FOLKS OUT OF PARTICIPATING BUT IF YOU PROVIDE A MATCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE ARE THE SPORT. WITHOUT HAVING TO INITIALLY PAY THAT THE THAN YOU MIGHT END UP BY GENERATING MUCH MORE REVENUE SO WHY WOULD DFW DO THAT. WELL IT'S UNCLEAR WE AT WE DID ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT YEAH YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN I THINK SIX YEARS SINCE THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO DO SO IN AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED SO THEY WANT INCENTIVIZE BY MORE REVENUE TO. CREATE THESE THREE DAYS. IT'S AYE IT'S UNCLEAR YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THEM. THANK YOU. AND YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT SEEN. NONE. WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER BIGELOW SECOND BY MRS RUBIO.

I'M HERE JOINED BY MY CO WORKER COREY PICKING ANY CONSERVATION COORDINATOR WHILE COAST. AND WE'RE HERE THIS MORNING TO REQUEST AYE VOTE FOR AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE TO INCREASE THE FINES FOR COMMERCIAL POACHING VIOLATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA'S MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OR MPAS. WHILE BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM THAT CONSERVE COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE WE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN DEVELOPING CALIFORNIA'S MARINE PROTECTED AREA NETWORK. AND THEN WE TRANSITIONED INTO HELPING IMPLEMENT THIS NETWORK THROUGH. OUTREACH BUILDING PUBLIC STEWARDSHIP CORNING CITIZEN SCIENCE MONITORING AND ENHANCING FOR SOME POLICY TO CALIFORNIA'S A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THESE UNDER WATER PARKS TWENTY THE WORLD'S LARGEST NETWORK INTEGRATED NETWORKS OF A MARINE PROTECTED AREAS COVERS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF STATE WATERS. GOALS INCREASING FISHERY BIOMASS ENHANCING ECOSYSTEM HEALTH ENHANCING RECREATIONAL VALUE OF SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST ICONIC COASTAL PLACES. ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR MPAS IS MAXIMUM PUBLIC COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS THIS REQUIRES OUTREACH TO BROWN DIVERSE PUBLIC AUDIENCE. ABOUT THE RULES AND REGULATIONS IT ALSO REQUIRES ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS THAT ADDRESS THE VARYING LEVELS OF MISS COMPLIANCE ACROSS THE STATE.

AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW ALL URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS ARE REQUIRED TO. A PREPARE AND SUBMIT TO THE STATE A WATER LOSS AUDIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND HAVING AND ASSESSMENT OF THE DEGREE OF ACCURACY OR INACCURACY OF THE METERS UTTERANCE SERVICE. IS REALLY ESSENTIAL PART OF GETTING A GOOD ESTIMATE OF WATER LOSSES FROM SYSTEM.
