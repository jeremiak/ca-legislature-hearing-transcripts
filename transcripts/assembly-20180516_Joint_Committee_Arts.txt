I DID A LOT DARKER SIDE. HEY SO I SEE OUR MYSTERIOUS YEARS I'D LIKE TO CALL THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF JUDGMENT AND THE ARTS. TODAY MAY SIXTEENTH TO ORDER. AND I WANT TO. WELCOME EVERYONE HERE AND WISH THE VERY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US I I FIRST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. OUR TODAY SPEAKERS I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TESTIFY. BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE WE WE VERY MUCH THANK THEM FOR THE REMARKS THEY WILL BE PROVIDING. WE APPRECIATE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WERE JOINING US BOTH HERE IN OUR HEARING ROOM AND ALSO ON LIVE STREAM. BUT TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THE TOPIC IS CALIFORNIAN HUMAN COMPANY HUMANITIES BUILDING BRIDGES. IN AMPLIFYING VOICES AND IT'S GOING TO EXPLORE THE HUMANITIES WHAT THEY ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY INTERSECT WITH THE ARTS HOW THEY ARE A CHANGING IN THE DIGITAL AGE. WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHAT VALUES DO THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES HAVE IN OUR DIVERSE STATE WITH THEIR ROLE. IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. DURING A VISIT TO STANFORD AUTHOR PHILOSOPHER AND UNIVERSE CHICAGO PROFESSOR MARTHA NUSSBAUM ANSWERED THIS QUESTION SHE NOTED THAT. HUMANITIES AND ARTS PROGRAMS ARE BEING CUT AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION NOT ONLY IN THE U. S. BUT UNFORTUNATE ALSO AROUND THE WORLD THIS. TREND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A GENERATION OF. CITIZENS WHO ARE ILL EQUIPPED TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY FOR THE MORE. SHE NOTED THAT ARTS SPARKS CURIOSITY FOR THE UNFAMILIAR. BY LEARNING TO SING MUSIC FROM ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE THE CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD. THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO SEE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS IS FULL OF PEOPLE WITH THOUGHTS AND. AND FEELINGS AND ALSO BUILD NATIONS THAT ARE ABLE TO OVERCOME FEAR AND SUSPICION. IN FAVOR OF SYMPATHETIC AND WELL REASONED DEBATE. THESE THOUGHTS WERE SHARED WITH STUDENTS AT STANFORD IN TWENTY TWELVE BUT THEY CERTAINLY RING TRUE TODAY. OUR SELECTION OF CURRENT TIMES AND AND CURRENT EVENTS. SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM KATRINA WOOLWORTH WILL SHARE HER* ARE A REPORT ON THE CURRENT STATE. OF THE HUMANITIES AND EDUCATION ALSO I WILL BE LOOKING AT AND THE TREND LINE THAT PROFESSOR NUSSBAUM EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO. WERE CERTAINLY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF FUNDING OF THE NE A SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE. THAT WHEN THE THE TWENTY NINETEEN WHITE HOUSE. A BUDGET PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN FEBRUARY INCLUDED AGAIN THE WINDING DOWN OF THE NATIONAL DOWN FOR THE AMENITIES AND THEN ASK THEM FOR THE ARTS. BLUE. FORTUNATELY A BIPARTISAN EFFORT OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS COMING TOGETHER. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. THEY SUSTAIN AND THEN EVEN RAISE THOSE BUDGETS INCLUDED A THREE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR EACH AGENCY THAT SCORES A MINUSCULE AMOUNT FOR ARTS AGENCIES THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW IT DECIDED IMPACT IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE NATION AT LEVERAGE CLOSE TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE DECADES. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS A COMMON EFFORT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK ON I I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE GONNA. I ENJOY SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GONNA BE HAVING TODAY. PROJECTS THAT WILL BE SHOWCASING. PROJECTS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE THAT SPEAK TO THE MANY POWERFUL AND CREATIVE WAYS IN WHICH HUMANITIES ARE BEING UTILIZED TO SUPPORT. AND CONNECT WITH ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE AREA THAT WILL BE SPENDING SOME TIME LOOKING LOOKING AT I SEE WE HAVE OUR MUSEUMS STAY FOCUSED HERE POLITICIZED THERE YOU GO. ARE AA EITHER AS I SAY DOWN OKAY. YEAH GOD SO BUSY AND CERTAINLY DO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS IN THIS WORLD AND I I'M PROUD TO BE A CONVERTIBLE CAR AUTHORS ON AMBER AND WHAT OCCURS USE MUSEUMS FOR ALL BILL THAT'S. MAYBE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR A VERY AUSPICIOUS. NUMBER. AID REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL ENDOWMENT TO ESTABLISH. THE CALIFORNIA MINUTE MUSEUMS FOR ALL GRANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE ACROSS. ACCESS TO MUSEUMS. FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. SO ANYWAY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GREAT TURMOIL IN THE WORLD OF PERVASIVE A PERVASIVELY DIVISIVE MOOD ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. I JUST THIS WEEK A MAN SCREAMED ISLAMOPHOBIC COMMENTS AT A WOMAN PERSON COFFEE AT A COFFEE SHOP A COFFEE BEAN AND RIVERSIDE. SHE WAS DRESSED IN TRADITIONAL MUSLIM ATTIRE YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE THE ESTABLISHMENT DID THE RIGHT THING AND REFUSE SERVICE TO THE MAN KICKED HIM OUT. FOR HEARING TOO MANY. TOO MANY INCIDENCES LIKE THIS. I BELIEVE THIS HEARING IS VERY TIMELY I HOPE WILL SPUR NECESSARY DISCUSSION ON WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN FOR THE SUPPORT THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES IN OUR STATE. WHICH IN TURN WILL SUPPORT HIM A MORSE OF CIVIL SOCIETY OUR WILL WE'RE LOOKING TO EACH OTHER BETTER UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER STORIES WHERE WE COME FROM WE'RE GOING. IN UNDERSTAND OUR COMMON HUMANITY. SO BEFORE I TURN OF THE DICE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT TO QUOTE ANOTHER GREAT ARTS AND HUMANITIES ADVOCATE ARE FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. WHO NOTED THAT THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES DEFINE WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE? THAT IS THEIR POWER TO REMIND US OF WHAT WE HAVE. TO OFFER WHAT WE EACH HAVE TO OFFER AND AND WHAT WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND OUR HISTORY. AND TO IMAGINE OUR FUTURE TO GIVE US HOPE IN THE MOMENTS OF STRUGGLING TO BRING US TOGETHER. WHEN NOTHING ELSE WILL. WHEN NOTHING ELSE WELL THAT'S A TRULY THE POWER OF THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES AND.

AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO CALL IT OUR FIRST PANEL WILLIAM DEVEREAUX WHO SAID PHD AND DIRECTOR. OF THE HUNTING USC INSTITUTE ON CALIFORNIA THE WEST AND HE'S GOING TO GIVE US. AN INTRODUCTION DEFINITIONS AN OVERVIEW OF THE HUMANITIES. PROFESSOR DEBORAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS WILLIAM DEVER L.. CHAIRMAN ALLEN VICE CHAIR CHEW AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY THANKS FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. I'M AN HISTORIAN. ODDLY ALLEGIANT TO THE HUMANITIES AND PRACTICE AND PASSION. I TEACH HISTORY USC IN MY POSITION ALLOWS ME TO BE IN RESIDENCE AT THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY FOR RESEARCH AND TEACHING. TWO HUMANNESS THIS IS THE INTELLECTUAL VERSION OF OFFERING A KID THE KEYS TO THE CANDY STORE. I'VE SERVED ON THE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AMENITIES TWICE THAT SERVICE HAS BEEN THE MOST REWARDING PUBLIC WRK OF MY CAREER. IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO WORK AT THE SCENE BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC IN THE SCHOLARLY WORLD. OF IN MY CASE AMERICAN HISTORY SPECIFICALLY THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE AMERICAN WEST. MY PROMPT THIS AFTERNOON IS TO DEFINE THE HUMANITIES. IT'S NOT AN EASY QUESTION. ONE ANSWER MOST OF THE ONE THAT I MOSTLY GOOD WITH. IS THAT THE HUMANITIES OCCUPY THAT SECTOR OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION CARVED OUT BY A SET OF DISCIPLINARY INTERESTS HISTORY LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND CLASSICS AMONG THEM. AS WELL AS COGNATE FIELDS INTERPRETING TEXTS OR ART EVENTS IN LIVES MOMENTS AND ERAS. WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY WHERE THE FIELD SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THE ARTS. WE ARE THE LETTERS IN COLLEGES OF LETTERS ARTS AND SCIENCES WE ARE THE BOOK PEOPLE. WE READ THEM AND WE WRITE THEM AND WE MAKE OUR STUDENTS READ THEM AND THINK ABOUT THEM. THAT'S ONE WAY TO DEFINE THE HUMANITIES AND IT'S USEFUL. A SET OF FIELDS EXPLORING IDEAS ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND ABOUT HUMANITY. ON OUR BEST DAYS WE THINK OF OUR WORK AS A CALLING. AND WE REVEL IN THE CIVIL EXCHANGE OF IDEAS ABOUT JUST WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN. WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM THAT ROOT OF THE WORD ITSELF. THE HUMAN IN THE HUMANITIES. BUT ALLOW ME TO BRING ACADEMIC AND POINTY HEADED DISTINCTIONS TO THE GROUND AND A REAL EXPERIENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE HUMANITIES ARE BRIDGE THE MOST EFFECTIVE BRIDGE BETWEEN SCHOLARSHIP AND THE PUBLIC WHICH ALL OF US SERVE. THE HUMANITIES OBLIGATE US TO SPEAK TO BIG AUDIENCES AND BIG PUBLIC'S. OF COURSE THERE'S ROOM FOR ARCANE ACADEMIC ARGUMENT AND LANGUAGE. THERE IS TECHNICAL PROVISIONS IN THE POSITION IN THE HUMANITIES ARGUMENTS STEEPED IN ARCHAIC TEXTS LANGUAGES EXPERIENCES. BUT AT HEART DOING HUMANITIES AS AN ACT OF TRANSLATION. FOSTERING THE TRANSMISSION OF IDEAS AND INSIGHTS FROM THE ACADEMY TO BROADER PUBLIC'S. BUT THIS IS A BRIDGE OPEN THE TWO WAY TRAFFIC. BECAUSE OUR MEDIUM IS USUALLY WORDS SPOKEN WRITTEN SONG OR OTHERWISE. WE CAN AND DO BRING THE PUBLIC'S WORDED LIVES AND CONCERNS IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS. SO AS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC'S YOUR EARNINGS LEGITIMIZED FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH. SO AS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC HEARD. THE HUMANITIES COMMUNICATE. ME TO MY CLASSROOM YES BUT SO TOO FROM THE WORLD OF CALIFORNIANS TO THAT CLASSROOM. CALIFORNIANS YOUNG AND OLD CALIFORNIANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE AND EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. WE ARE CALIFORNIANS ALL. THINK OF WHAT WE ASK THE HUMANITIES TO TEACH US. THINK OF THE BONDS OF COMMUNITY AND PURPOSE WE ASK THE HUMANITIES TO FORGE. THINK BACK. THE HUMANITIES TELL US WHERE WE WHO WE ARE. MYSTERIOUS PUZZLING OPEN TO DEBATE WHO CAME FIRST TO CALIFORNIA WHO POPULATED THIS PLACE AND WHEN. THE HUMANITIES PACKAGE DATA. DENVER CHRONOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGY PALEONTOLOGY FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY. AND HELP TELL HUMAN STORY OF MIGRATION FROM FAR TO THE NORTH. FROM THE STEPS FROM ASIA OR MAYBE FROM POLYNESIA BY OUTRIGGER CANOES ALL THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO LIKELY MORE. THE HUMANITIES POSE ORIGIN STORIES FOR CALIFORNIA JUST THAT THEY INTERPRET AND ANALYZE THEM. THE HUMANITIES IN THIS WAY REMIND US OF OUR PATRIMONY OF ANCIENT DIVERSITY. PRE DATING ANY MODERN JUST ASSUMPTIONS OF DIFFERENCE IN MULTI CULTURALISM. THEY MAKE OF CHAIN A CHAIN OF HUMANITY THAT STOPS FOR THE MOMENT WITH US. THE AMENITIES CAUTION US AND THEN NOBLE US. OF COURSE WE FIND PAIN AND HEARTACHE IN THE PAST. THE HUMANITIES TEACHERS FOR INSTANCE ABOUT GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE INTO CALIFORNIA'S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. A MURDEROUS KNOWS THAT WE MUST PLACE AGAINST ANY QUITE VISION OF HAPPY GO LUCKY GOLD RUSH MINERS SPLASHING IN SIERRA STREAMS. AS THEY ILLUMINED THE GOLD STATE GOLDEN STATE IN NICKNAME AND HOPE. THEY DID SPLASH BUT THEY KILLED TWO. THE HUMANITIES DOESN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE WITHOUT SIN. NOR DOES IT LET THESE YOUNG MEN OFF HISTORIES HOOK OF JUDGMENT. SIMULTANEOUSLY THE HUMANITIES RAISES UP THE BEST OF US AND OF THEM. THE POETS IN THE LYRICAL WHO MADE OF CALIFORNIA DREAM. THE MUSICAL THIS DRIVERS. AND ALL THOSE WHOSE LIVES THEY TOUCHED AND WHO YET ARE TOUCHED BY THEM. I TEACH BRET HART I TEACH RICHARD HENRY DANA I TEACH DESIRE ROYCE AND DAME SHIRLEY. AND THE STORIES OF CHILEAN GOLD MINERS I TEACH ISHI AND FATHER SERRA. I TEACH THE LIES OF MISSION INDIANS WHO LEARN SPANISH AND CATHOLIC SACRAMENTS BUT WHO MADE CERTAIN THAT THEIR GRAVES HAD INDIAN BEADS AND SHELLS ALONG SIDE. INQUISITION ERA CATHOLIC PRAYERS AS THEIR FINAL SEND OFF BECAUSE. WELL BECAUSE THIS LIFE IN THE AFTERLIFE FOR COMPLICATED. THE HUMANITIES HELP US SEE AND SOMETIMES UNLOCK THAT VERY COMPLEXITY. THE HAND HUMANITIES GUIDE MY STUDENTS FORWARD PAST THE GOLD RUSH. UNDER THE WAYS WHICH CALIFORNIA PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE COMING OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR. UNDER RECONSTRUCTION AND URBANIZATION. THE RISE OF LOS ANGELES WAR AND DEPRESSION AND MORE WAR. WE HANG OUT WITH WOODY GUTHRIE IN LOS ANGELES WE WALK WITH CHAVEZ AND WHERE TO AND JOHN STEINBECK. WE EXPLORE THE RISE OF NIXON AND REAGAN OF EDMUND BROWN SENIOR AND JUNIOR OF STANFORD AND SALLY RIDE OF JOAN DIDION. AND BREITBART ANGELA DAVIS MARIO SAVIOLA. AND WE THINK HARD ABOUT FILMS AND FREEWAYS NATIONAL PARKS EARTHQUAKES AND FIRES CRIME AND PUNISHMENTJAILS ND REDEMPTION. JUSTICE AND OPPRESSION. CALIFORNIA IS A BIG AND OFTEN BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS UPON WHICH TO PAINT AND UP TO PICTURE LIVES PAST AND PRESENT. AND HUMANITIES ARE THE MEDIUM THAT BRINGS IT ALL TO LIFE. THEY ECHO ACROSS TIME AND SPACE THEY TAKE US FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BRIDGING EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE AN AUDIENCE. THE HUMANITIES CAPTIVATE FOURTH GRADERS MAKING SENSE OF THEIR STATE. AND THE HUMANITIES LISTEN TO THOSE SAME TEN YEAR OLD WHEN THEY SPEAK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CALIFORNIA. THE HUMANITIES TAKE US FROM TEXTBOOK LEARNING. TWO SOURCES TUCKED AWAY IN ARCHIVES TO THOSE UNDER THE BED. IN THE ATTIC OUT IN THE GARAGE EVEN IN THE GARBAGE. I'VE KNOWN MANY A DUMPSTER DIVING LIBRARIAN AND ARCHIVIST OF MY TIME. THESE HEROES RESCUE THE DNA BUILDING BLOCKS OF OUR SHARED HUMANITIES CULTURE IN THE THANKS WE GIVE THEM. IS NOTHING TO WHAT GRATITUDE THE FUTURE WILL BESTOW ON THEM. THE HUMANITIES THE INTERPRETATION OF WORDS HISTORIES AND EXPERIENCES OF BEING HUMAN. OF BEING CALIFORNIA. CARRY WEIGHT FOR ALL OF US. THEY DRAW US TOGETHER EVEN AS THEY HONOR OUR DIFFERENCES. THEY HELP SOLDER AND SUSTAINED. THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING WE'VE BEEN PERFECTLY CONSTRUCTED OUT HERE ON THE FAR WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. CALIFORNIA IS A NECKLACE OF EXPERIENCES AND HISTORIES MEMORIES AND DREAMS THAT WE HAVE ALL CONCOCTED. BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY. THE HUMANITIES ADD VALUE TO ALL THAT. HUMANITIES ARE I THINK OUR ACTUAL VALUES. THAT THE HUMANITIES ARE ABOUT THE VERY POOR ASSUME THAT DEFINES US SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE PRACTICE OF THE HUMANITIES. OUGHT TO DRAW SUSTENANCE FROM THE VERY PUBLIC THAT THEY IN TURN INEVITABLY MOLD AND SUSTAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL I I WOULD I SIGN UP FOR YOUR CLASS RIGHT HERE IS THAT WE HAVE MILITARY AND. THANK YOU YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH I KNOW THAT JUST FANTASTIC APPRECIATE THAT THAT FRAMING. WITH CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO THAT I'M I'M READING YOUR BIO AND I WANT TO CHECK OUT THESE BLACKWELL COMPANIONS AS. THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON I GUESS THAT THOSE ARE.

CUTTING EDGE SCHOLARLY WORK THE THREE I'VE WORKED ON. OR THE AMERICAN WEST CALLIE ANALOGIES ARE THEY THEY'RE ANTHOLOGIES OF ORIGINAL SCHOLARLY ESSAYS SO ROUTE TWENTY FIVE S. IS A PIECE BY THE BEST. I THINK THE BEST TIME. CONTEMPORARY ESSAYS AHA TAKING APART IN THIS CASE THE WEST CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES IN SEQUENCE. TRY THE NEXT ONE I GUESS IS PROBABLY THE HISTORY OF PASADENA OR SOMETHING TICKET. O'CONNOR. AND THEN. I SPENT. THE FIRST HALF OF TODAY IN THE STATE ARCHIVES. RESEARCHING A NEW BOOK ABOUT A TRAGIC EVENT IN. THE LATE NINETEEN FORTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

WE REACH ONCE OUR FRAME DAY RIGHT EFFORTS COMING FROM STATE GOVERNMENT WAS CALIFORNIA EITHER FROM CALIFORNIA MANAGER FROM STATE GOVERNMENT WELL ONLY TO REITERATE THAT MY SERVICE ON THE BOARD THE CALIFORNIA AMENITIES. WHICH. I'VE DONE TWICE IN MY CAREER. HAS BEEN. SO FUNDAMENTAL TO THE WAYS IN WHICH I THINK ABOUT THE PUBLIC. AND HOW I'D CATCH MY CLASSES AND HOW I COACH MY RESEARCH AND ITS REACH. SO THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP FROM THE ACADEMY INTO PUBLIC ROUNDS. HAS BEEN NOT JUST INVIGORATING BUT IT'S BEEN FEEL CHANGING FOR ME PROFESSION CHANGING THEM SO INTERACTING WITH. THE INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC FROM SCHOOL KIDS ON UP TO. FOLKS IN SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND BRINGING THE HUMANITIES TO THEM AND ALSO HAVING THEM INFORM US ABOUT THEIR OWN PERCEPTION OF THE AMENITIES IN THEIR OWN HUMAN. LIVES AND CONDITIONS IT'S. IT'S CONSTANTLY. ENERGIZING INVIGORATING STARTS IT'S POWERFUL IS MOSTLY POWERFUL AN ELECTION OUR FULL WE GET A LITTLE WINDOW THAT TOO I MEAN JUST BEING ABLE TO INTERACT WITH SOME PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CROSS SECTIONS OF OUR SCIETY COMING UP HERE AND AND THAT. I I GUESS I CAN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR FRAMING OUR DISCUSSION SO. SO POIGNANTLY.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIRMAN ALAN AND AND VICE CHAIRMAN XU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. IT'S. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ONE TO PULL FOCUS ON. THE BY PRODUCT OF MY FILM AND. CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES WHO GAVE US FUNDING. AND. LAUREN ARE WE GOING TO PLAY THE CLIP FIRST OKAY SURE OKAY THIS IS TRYING TO SAN FRANCISCO OF THIS IS THAT THIS GUY THOUGHT YES AND FANTASTIC. YEAH THERE'S SOME. IN THE LAST YEAR OR YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING THINGS. I'M GETTING VERY FORGETFUL AND TIME. SO THAT'S WHAT MY PROBLEM IS. I WANT TO CAPTURE MY MEMORIES. AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO CAPTURE MY MEMORIES IS TO MAKE THEM. IN THREE DIMENSIONS ALL MY MINIATURES A COMPOSITE. IT'S HALF WISHING. THEM MEMORIES. BEFORE. THANK YOU. I HAD AN INCREDIBLE SCENE. SO THE FILM IS CALLED FOREVER CHINATOWN AND IT IS ABOUT AN EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD CHINESE AMERICAN ARTISTS WHO MAKES MINIATURE MODELS OF SAN FRANCISCO CHINATOWN. OF OF HIS GRANDMOTHER'S KITCHEN HIS AUNT'S DINING ROOM. IS. FOUND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS LIVING ROOM HIS FRIEND'S STORE FRONTS AND SO. I WANTED TO MAKE A FILM. THAT. HIGHLIGHTED A ON THE AT AS YOUR MEMORY CHANGES AS YOU AGE YOUR YOUR MEMORIES FADE AND YOUR MEMORIES CHANGE AND MAP IT TO. A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS ALSO EXPERIENCING CHANGE AND CHANGE IS AN INEVITABLE. THROUGH LIKE A. BUT THE. SO SO THIS FILM TOUCHES ON THREE POINTS IT'S ABOUT AS THE ARTIST HIS MEMORY HIS ARTWORK. THE COMMUNITY OF SERVICES GO CHINATOWN AND ALSO IT SPEAKS ABOUT THE ENCROACHING REDEVELOPMENT THAT'S COMING I THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THIS THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. AND. AS I MENTIONED. CHANGE IS INEVITABLE BUT. WHEN WHEN A COMMUNITY GETS. WHEN REDEVELOPMENT HAPPENS AND YOU DISPLACED FAMILIES THAT'S WHEN A LINE NEEDS TO BE DRAWN. SO THIS FILM ULTIMATELY. I WANTED TO TOUCH UPON THAT SOME GONNA READ A LITTLE BIT FROM MY DIRECTOR STATEMENT SO A LITTLE BACKGROUND OUT AT LEAST HALF OF. THE FILM. I'M NOT SOME CISCO BAY AREA FILMMAKER. WITH ROOTS IN CHINA VIETNAM A REFUGEE CAMP IN INDONESIA AND WE GOT SPONSORED OVER TO THE MIDWEST. WHEN I WAS. AROUND FOUR FIVE HUNDRED WEST ONE OF ENGL MINNESOTA ACROSS. SIMILAR TO VIETNAM YEAH YEAH VERY SIMILAR YOU TAKE IT WAS THE DEAD OF WINTER WHEN WE ARRIVE FROM FROM THE TROPICS YOU MIGHT WANT TO SPEAK. TO THE MICHAEL OKAY. OR DO YOU GOT IT. HOUSES. IT'S ALRIGHT ARE HERE RIGHT OKAY GREAT GREAT GREAT. SO MY SENSIBILITIES ARE SHAPED BY MY LIVED EXPERIENCES OF THESE TRANSITORY IDEAS OF HOME. UP THROUGH FRANK WANTS TO SEVEN CHINATOWN DEAR RAMA'S FROM THE RECENT FILMS FOREVER CHINATOWN. THE UNREFINED SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY TRANSPORTED. THIS RELATE BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD AT HOME. IN THE FIRST STUDIO APARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S A WORKING CLASS DISTRICT OF THE TENDERLOIN. AND. IT'S AN UNREFINED AT SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY AND. THE SUM OF MY FAMILY'S BELONGINGS FIT INSIDE THIS MINIATURE APARTMENT AND MY IMAGINATION CONTRACTED AN EXPANDED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MY TWIN MATTRESS SIZE ROOM. IT WAS A HALL CLOSET IN THE IT WAS A MAKESHIFT HALL CLOSET ROOM. THROUGH THE DETAILED WORLD OF FRANK ONES DO AROUND AS WE EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION OF A CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT IS INTIMATELY INTERWOVEN WITH THE HISTORY OF THAT CITY. FOREVER CHINATOWN IS A FRIEND STATE OF MIND IT IS A COMMENTARY ON THE ENCROACHING CHANGES TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT IS MY LOVE LETTER TO A BELOVED COMMUNITY THAT HELP MY FAMILY AND MY DAD IN PARTICULAR. FRANK BECOMES OUR GUIDE AS WE JOURNEY BACK WITH HIM THROUGH HIS IN ASTROLOGY NOSTALGIC VISIONS OF HIS YOUTH. VIS A VIS HIS ARTWORK AND PRESENT A CHINATOWN. EXQUISITE AS THEY ARE FRANK'S LAVISH STORIES AND THE AROMAS ARE COMPOSITES OF ONE PERSON'S ROMANTICIZE EXPERIENCES OF PLACES. BECAUSE HE IS HUMAN AND HUMAN MEMORIES ARE FALLIBLE HIS IS JUST ONE ENTRY POINT INTO THE WORLD OF CHINATOWN. AND IN AN EFFORT TO SHOW THE LARGER PERSPECTIVE A CHINATOWN WE END THE FILM AND PORTRAITS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE FILM NEEDED TO SEAMLESSLY WEAVE TOGETHER THREE EQUAL PARTS THE CONTOURS OF THE ARTIST'S LIFE THE INTIMACY OF THE INTIMACY OF HIS ART WORK. AND THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE FILM CHINATOWN. I WANTED TO PULL FOCUS ON THE ENCROACHING CHANGE TO THIS HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT ALSO I WANTED TO. FOCUS ON A FEW OF THE CHINATOWN COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE HE IS ONLY ONE. STORY AND SO IN THE END OF THE FILM WE WE GET TO MEET DOROTHY WHO. SHE'S EIGHTY THREE YEARS OLD SHE'S BORN AND RAISED IN THIS THIS ALLEYWAY AND CHINATOWN SHE'S STANDING IN FRONT. OF I PULLED PORK FOCUS ON JOSHUA CHUCK WHO WAS RECENTLY DISPLACED IN A HOME THAT HE WAS. RAISED IN A BORN AND RAISED IN IN CHINATOWN. AND THE MAIN REASON FOR PULLING FOCUS ON ALL THESE IS. THAT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE STRENGTH OF. THE THREATENED COMMUNITY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY ARE. THE HUMAN PILLARS. OF THIS OF SOCIETY. AND SO. FOR ME TO BE HERE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE HONOR ONE BECAUSE. CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES WAS ONE OF OUR EARLY EARLY THIS. FOUNDATIONS THAT GAVE US FUNDING AND WITH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GO INTO PRODUCTION I WAS ABLE TO ASSEMBLE A TEAM GO INTO PRODUCTION. AND. WE FROM FROM THAT FOUND OF FUNDING WE WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT OTHER FOUNDATIONS LIKE CENTER FOR ASIAN AMERICAN MEDIA AROUND WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT GET FUNDING FROM. SOME CISCO FOUNDATION. THEM. AND THIS FILM WENT ON IN THE INTO THE WORLD AND. WE CAME FULL CIRCLE BACK A YEAR LATER WE ARE HERE AND WE JUST RECEIVED OUR EMMY NOMINATION FOR. AWESOME AND IT'S NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE LIKE IT'S INCREDIBLE HONOR MAINLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST FOR MYSELF IT IS FOR. A VALIDATION TO. THE COMMUNITY OF CHINATOWN TO SAY THAT YES YOUR YOUR STORIES MATTER IN YOUR STORIES. WE NEED TO BE PRESERVED AND SO FOR MYSELF AS A FILMMAKER MY TOOL IS THROUGH STORYTELLING THROUGH PULLING FOCUS AND AND. ON TO THE COMMUNITY AND. THAT'S HOW I SERVE MY COMMUNITY. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY COOL VERY CALM. OKAY NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DAUNTED BYTHE WAY I SHOULD MENTION. ENGINE THAT MARIAH REMY. HAD TO CANCEL LAST MINUTE SO WERE ON. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HEARING FROM HER BUT WE WE DO HAVE. I FANTASTIC GROUP OBVIOUSLY AND I WILL NOT HEAR FROM YOU MR CLARK. OF THE MEN. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING. DANTE CORPORATION CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GOING TO WATCH. LEAVE A SHORT CLIP TRAILER OF THE DOCUMENTARY ROMEO IS BLEEDING. I MEAN YOU THINK. TWO HOW. BOTH ALIKE IN DIGNITY. AND EVERYONE WILL WE LAY OUR SCENE. FIRST TIME I. AND I WAS LIKE THIS LEANING ON IT AND AS I GOT INTO MY LIFE. NOW WHEN I READ IT IS LIKE THIS IT WAS GOING ON IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT NOW. RACE CALIFORNIA. WELCOME LESS. LAST WEEKEND WE HAD A SHOOTING EVERY NIGHT. ONE NIGHT WE HAD TO SHOOT. THE GANG PROBLEM IS ABOUT. THE REASON WHY WE ARE FIGHTING. ARE PAIRED WAS FIGHTING. HELLO BROTHER IS REALLY EASY. TO BE AT THE. ALWAYS ENVISIONED MYSELF BAND SOMEBODY POURED. I WANT TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRUG DEALERS AND RACE. NOT FAIRY. BASICALLY THE BAD AGAIN OKAY CELEBI INDICATES ROBBIE REALLY GET LAST LAUGH. A LOT. DANTE WAS AT THAT INTERESTING LIKE CROSSROADS WHERE HE HAD JUST DISCOVERED SPOKEN WORD AT. INTERESTED IN TEACHING INCIDENT AT A STREET SO I I CHANGE MY PROFESSION. WE FEEL IT TAKES ROMEO AND JULIET RE WRITE IT AND MAKE IT FIT RACE ME. ROMEO IS FROM NORTH RAISING JULIET FROM CENTRAL. YES MAKE YOU LIVE. BLACK. I REALLY START LOOKING AT PERSONAGES KILLING YOUR OWN. KILLING YOUR OWN PEOPLE. STEP FORWARD IF YOU HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO GUN VIOLENCE. I GOT A COMMUNITY THE PANEL OKAY LET FEAR STOP ME AND ALL I GOT. BROTHERS GOT KILLED COUPLE DAYS AGO. THIS. WELL. IT'S. OUR IMITATION ALIVE. I HAVE CONTROL OVER HOW TO PLAY IN. LIFE. YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE. ON. TWO DAYS THAT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. BUILDING BRIDGES. AND AMPLIFY VOICES. SO THAT THE PLANET IS DOCUMENTARY WAS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WITH OUR ORGANIZATION THAT I HELPED CO FOUND CALL RAW TALENT WHICH THE FOUR RECENT ARTISTS WITH TALENT. WAS PUT ON A LOT OF SPOKEN WORD SHOWS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AT RISK FOR NOW WE WILL SURVIVE. BECAUSE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO IS COMING TO ME FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING TO ME ABOUT THEIR DAILY PROBLEMS BUT THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICES WILL BE HEARD IN THE SCHOOL OR A PARENT'S DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM. OR THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT REFLECTED THEM TEACHING THEM THE CURRICULUM THAT THE SCHOOL WAS IN FORCING UPON THEM. SO THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO ME TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY WOULD EXPERIENCE IN DAY TO DAY OUTSIDE IN THE STREETS OF RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAD. SET ASIDE WEEKLY WORKSHOPS FOR THEM TO COME TALK ABOUT A PROCESS TO THE PROCESS OF WRITING IN A PERFORMANCE SO WANTED TO MINCE WORDS WIL BE MORGAN OF MINES HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE DO ROMEO AND JULIET. BUT HE WAS A ON. A LOVE OF THEATER HE HAS ELEVEN THEATER SO HE WANTED TO DO THE ACTUAL PLAY ROMEO JULIET NOT TOLD HIM WHY IT HAS TO MAKE SENSE TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO REALLY RELATE TO IT BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. I WAS INTRODUCED TO ROMEO JULIET BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF CONTEXT FOR ME UNTIL I SAW THE VIDEO. UNTIL I SAW LEONARDO DI CAPRIO IN THESE WEIRD LITTLE A NINETIES MOVIE PLANNED WITH THESE GUNS INSTEAD OF FORCE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS SAYING. BUT THE CONTEXT OF THE VISUALS HELP ME RELATE TO THAT PART BECAUSE THE GUNS IN THE FEUDING AND SO I SAY I WANTED TO TAKE THIS PLAY TO TALK ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IS GOING ON IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE. IF THE TEACHERS WOULD ALLOWED US TO AMPLIFY OUR VOICES IN THE CLASSROOM IMAGINES FORCE US TO READ ABOUT VERONA IF THEY WANT TO SHOW IN THE CURRICULUM HOW MORONIC KENEXA RACE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS WAS GOING ON BETWEEN MONTAGUE AND CAPULET AS NOR VERSUS CENTRAL HOW CAN YOU BE A PART OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM A SOLUTION BECAUSE ROMEO AND JULIET DIE. AND I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT DIED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT TIME I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL WITH A TEAM IS ALL THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SORT OF POINTED AT DOCUMENTARY WAS TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT IF WE CAN'T INTRODUCE THIS CURRICULUM FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS NOW AND AT THE END OF OUR PLAY OUR ROMEO JULIET DIDN'T DIE AND THAT'S WHAT MADE OUR CURRICULUM IN OUR PLAY? THAT MUCH POWERFUL AS A SAY LIKE TONIGHT WE CHOOSE LIFE. NO MORE OF US IS GOING TO DIE AND THIS IS HOW WE ENVISION OUR FUTURE TO BE BUT IF WE HAD THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. ALL THE TIME THEN IT WOULD TAKE JUST ONE DOCUMENTARY AND I WAS THANKFUL THAT. CAL HUMANITIES HAD THE THE RESOURCES TO HELP US NOT ONLY BUILD THAT BRIDGE WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF RICHMOND BUT AMPLIFIED VOICE AND WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO INDONESIA. ON THIS PAST. DECEMBER WHAT TO DECEMBER'S AGO AND I WAS ABLE TO GO TO AND DON'T NEED IT TO FOUR DIFFERENT CITIES AND TALK TO THEM AND I WAS ABLE TO CONNECT TO MY STORY ALL THE WAY OVER THERE. I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT. ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF RICHMOND CARED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME BUT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO INDONESIA FOR TWELVE DAYS. AND THEY SHOW ME SO MUCH LOVE AND THEY WAS IMPACTED BY OUR STORY SHOW ME THE POWER OF THE HUMANITIES AND THE ARTS WE ALLOWED A SPACE TO BE CULTIVATED. NASSAU WANTED TO SHARE. IF THEY'RE MAKING. WHAT WITH THE STATUS OF THE FILM IT'S PRODUCED IS OUT OF FILM IS ALREADY PRODUCES ALREADY BEEN RELEASED THIS PAST JULY ON THIS ON I TUNES A NET FLAKES ON GOOGLE PLAY ALL THEM A LITTLE VISUALS? BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH NETFLIX SO. IS OUT THERE GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT. I'M GOING TO GO WATCH IT. ALRIGHT MISTER BROWN LIVED HERE FOR YOU. YEAH. QUICKER THANK YOU. GETTING GOOD AFTERNOON. SENATOR ALLEN COMMITTEE I'M CHRIS BROWNE I'M THE DEPUTY COUNTY LIBRARIAN FOR THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY LIBRARY DISTRICT. I'M ONE OF THOSE LIBRARIANS AS MENTIONED PRIOR WHO DUMPSTER DIVES FOR BOOKS AND AND. STANDS UP FOR THE HUMANITIES AND I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO COME OUT HERE TODAY AND TO. SHARE. MY TEAMS PROJECT WITH YOU WARRING. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT DOWN THANKFULLY. MOST OF US DON'T HAVE TO GO TO WAR BUT FOR THOSE WHO. SERVED IN COMBAT IT'S IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT CAN ISOLATE AND SEPARATE THEM FROM THOSE WHO HAVEN'T. NOW MANY OF MANY OF OUR VETERANS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME COMING HOME. AND RE COMMITTING AN INTEGRATING INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. AND IT CAN BE AN OVERWHELMING PROCESS FOR VETERANS STRUGGLING TO BOTH PROCESS THEIR WARTIME EXPERIENCE AND RECOVER FROM PROFOUND LOSSES. MANY VETERANS REPORT. DEEP FEELINGS OF ALIENATION AND ISOLATION AS WELL AS LOSS OF PURPOSE. AND CLARITY FOR THEIR FUTURE. VETERANS CAN FEEL AS OTHER FAMILY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY. DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM THEY'RE CALLING TO MILITARY SERVICE WAR WHY THEY WOULD GO TO WAR. OUR PROJECTS OUGHT TO ADDRESS OUR VETERANS FEELINGS IN THEIR WORDS USING THEIR TATTOOS AS A GATEWAY TO MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION BETWEEN VETERANS. AND CIVILIANS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE PROJECT DIRECTOR IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FOR THIS EXHIBIT. THAT'S A A PICTURE OF ALL TWENTY FOUR VETERANS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE WERE ABLE TO COVER EIGHTEEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF WHO PARTICIPATED AND AGAIN THE PURPOSE WAS TO BRING BEGIN A DIALOGUE. BETWEEN CIVILIANS AND RETURNING THAT'S. AND EACH HAD TO SERVE AS A CATALYST FOR THIS DIALOGUE SINCE THE ARTISTIC CHOICES BY THE VETERANS DIRECTLY. REPRESENT THEIR MILITARY EXPERIENCES CAPTURING. EMOTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT ESPECIALLY IN A CULTURE THAT PRIZES TO WAS AS AN. HOW WE LAUNCH THE EXHIBIT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ON VETERANS DAY AND AND IMMEDIATELY ATTRACTED COVERAGE FROM? PBS THE ATLANTIC NEWSWEEK. THE WASHINGTON POST TO NAME A FEW. OTHER POSTS FEATURED WARRING IN A PIECE THAT. DISCUSSED. THE SITE AS A HIGHLY VISIBLE PART OF A NATIONAL DIALOGUE THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. CHANGING THEIR TATTOO POLICY. SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S AN EXHIBIT THAT. ACTUALLY IMPACTED PUBLIC POLICY. HE THE HUMANITIES IMPACTING POLICY. IT WAS HUMBLING TO BE PART OF SOMETHING THAT PLAYED AN IMPORTANT. IMPACT IN THAT COMMUNITY AND HELP BRING ABOUT. RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT FOR VETERANS. I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY. SHARE WITH YOU AN AUDIO CLIP FROM THE EXHIBIT. THIS IS FROM JOBS SLATER JEFF SERVED IN THE ARMY. HE DIDN'T VOLUNTEER HE VOLUNTEERED FOR ROUTE CLEARANCE WORK. WHICH IS AN EXTREMELY EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DUTY THAT PURPOSEFULLY CAUSES IED DETONATION WHICH SHE VOLUNTEERED. SO THAT OTHER VETERANS WOULDN'T BE INJURED. AND THIS IS JEFF SLATER LIKE HER LOCKER OVER. AND. THEN WHEN I CAME HOME I WAS PART YOU ACTUALLY TURN OUT. AND. WHAT IS THERE ON THE TOP TOP OF EACH OTHER? SERENITY YES YEAH. SO IT'S UP. OKAY GREAT WHEN I CAME HOME I WAS PRAISED AS A HERO. SOMEONE WHO. I PRESENTED OUR COUNTRY. AT THE FINEST LEVELS. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL. AND I GET PATS ON THE BACKS AND PEOPLE ALMOST CRYING TELL ME HOW PROUD THEY ARE OF ME. THEY HAD NO TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW I FELT. I WAS UNABLE TO LOVE I WAS UNABLE EXPRESS EMOTIONS I WAS VIOLENT VICIOUS. I JUST I I LOST IT ALL I LOST MY FIANCE I LOST MOST ALL MY FRIENDS HIGH. I CAN RELATE THERE WAS KNOWN INTERACTION TO ME IN THEM THAT WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL ANYMORE. I ALWAYS KNEW I WANTED A HAND GRENADE WITH WINGS TO ME THAT DESCRIBES WHO I AM IN THIS WORLD AS FAR AS. I I FEEL LIKE THAT GRENADE WITH THE PIN PULLED YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO GO OFF BUT YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY IT DOES. IN THE WINGS WERE SUPPOSED TO MEAN. MY JOURNEY THROUGH THIS WORLD. AND. I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID IT BUT SOMEONE SAID. SERENITY IS NOT FREEDOM FROM THE STORM. YET IT IS PEACE AMID THE STORM. AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL MY LIFE IS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO EVER BE PERFECT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BATTLE AFTER BATTLE AFTER BATTLE. AND. MY JOB ISN'T TO. FIX EVERYTHING. AND MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT MY JOB IS TO MAINTAIN. MY CALMNESS. AND MY EMOTIONS. THROUGH THIS BATTLE. THAT HAD TO. IS ALMOST A WAY TO KEEP MYSELF IN CHECK WHEN I SEE IT. IT REMINDS ME THAT. I'M STRUGGLING TO GET TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF ENLIGHTENMENT. IT'S LIKE CARRYING AN ADDICTION WITH YOU IT ALWAYS IS THERE SAT SHADOW BEHIND YOU AND. YOU NEVER LOSE THE ADDICTION YOU JUS HOPE THAT YOU CAN STAY AWAY FROM AS HIGH AS YOU CAN. WHEN I SAT IN LIFE AND I'M TRYING TO REACH IS TO. CREATE A NEW ME. WE HAD QUITE A BIT OF FEEDBACK AND. OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR THE EXHIBIT. IMPORT INTO THE WEBSITE AND BACK TO THE CREATIVE TEAM SELVES. ONE ONE PARTICIPANTWHO WAS NOT PART OF THE PROJECT COME TO THAT AFTER VIEWING THE SITE. WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS IS HIS QUOTE WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE THE FEELING OF NORMALCY IN MY HEART HAS. RIGHT NOW. AFTER DESCRIBING HIS OWN TATTOO AND SERVICE HE ADDED. THANK OU FOR MAKING ME FEEL NORMAL AGAIN. SO. THAT'S WHAT THE MAN IS CAN DO. I WANT ID CAN NOT TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL THE EXHIBIT BUT JUST SOME OF THE. DIVERSITY OF PARTICIPANTS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF THEM I REALLY LOVE THIS LAST PHOTO. THAT'S MY CARGO HE FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF PHANTOM FURY WHICH IS ONE OF THE. MOST. UGH CASUALLY CASUALTY WRITTEN BATTLES IN IRAQ. WHICH HAPPEN IN THE. MONTH OF NOVEMBER AND THAT'S HIS BABY DAUGHTER WHO WAS BORN IN NOVEMBER SO HE'S HAD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF HEART ABOUT WHAT NOVEMBER MEANS TO HIM. SO I SPENT FOUR YEARS ON THIS PROJECT WORKING WITH THESE WITH THESE VETERANS. WHICH WILL WE ENDED UP BECOMING MORE THAN OUR ORIGINAL GOAL FOR AN ONLINE EXHIBIT. AND THEY REALLY BECAME A COMMUNITY FOR THESE VETERANS AND CIVILIANS TO. BUILD FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT LAST TO THIS DAY. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE INITIAL GRANT WE GOT FROM CAL HUMANITY IS. REALLY. ALLOWED US TO PORN RESOURCES FROM ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHAT STARTED AS A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT? DUE TO DUE TO STATE LIBRARY FUNDING AND IN KIND SUPPORT TURNED INTO A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. AND I THINK HUMANITY IS A TRACT RESOURCES AND PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HELP BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOUT STORIES THAT. IN CAPSULE A WHAT WHAT OUR LIVES MEAN. AND SO ON BEHALF OF THE PROJECT TEAM IN THE PARTICIPATING VETERANS. AND OTHER GRAND PROVIDERS I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST THANKSFOR. THIS COMMITTEE LOOKING AT THE MEANING OF HUMANITY'S PROGRAMMING AND. PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THANK YOU. YOU THANK YOU WHAT CHRIS BROWN MAY. HAVE THE SAME I MAY HAVE THE GLASSES BUT HE'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL LIBRARIAN. LARGE I SHOULD MENTION THAT. THIS SPEAKS VOLUMES BUT CHRIS WAS. GIVEN THE. A LIBRARY JOURNAL MOVER AND SHAKER AWARD IN HONOR INTENDED TO RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS REPRESENT THE OUTSIZE IMPACT THAT LIBRARIANS CAN HAVE AND AND THIS CERTAINLY. SPEAK TO THAT SO THANK YOU THIS IS FANTASTIC SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS THAT. DANTE FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL DID DID YOU GUYS ACTUALLY. PERFORM. ROMEO AND JULIET. IN THE ORIGINAL SHAKESPEAREAN ENGLISH OR OR OR WHETHER IT WAS WE WAS LIKE A VERSION OF IT THAT I MEAN WHAT CAN YOU CAN GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT. THE PERFORMANCE WAS SORT OF PERFORMANCE WAS. IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE I HAD READ THE PLAY I BROKE DOWN TO THE THEMES OF THE PLAY AND THEN I RE WROTE IT BASED OFF OF HOW THIS PLAY OUT IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. OF SOILS LIKE THE FIRST SCENE MONSIGNOR KAVLI FIND AT THE SUPERMARKET OURS WAS AT THE RICHMOND. HOSPITAL KAISER DURING THE TIME THAT A CHEVRON CAUGHT ON FIRE KNOWING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE BE ATTRACTED TO THAT HOSPITAL IN NORFOLK SCHEDULE RUN INTO EACH OTHER SO WE USE THAT. AS A WAY TO GROUND ERASE FROM CALIFORNIA WITH THE HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE WERE FACING BUT HOW MOST PEOPLE WASN'T FOCUSING ON. THE CHEVRON ON FIRE IT WAS FOCUSING ON SHOOTING THEIR ENEMY AT THE HOSPITAL SO I WROTE A PLAY BASED OFF OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN ROMEO JULIET HOW CAN WE MEASURE THIS. IN OUR CITY SO WE RE WROTE THE DIALOGUE AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WROTE THEIR OWN MONOLOGUES IS SPOKEN WORD FORMAT. AND IN THE PLAY WAS CALL ROOM IS BLEEDING NOSE CAUGHT TASTES HARMONY. IS HARMING YOUR TAKE RED BEAM ME BEING A ROMEO AND HARMONY BEING A JULIA AND IT WAS PRETTY MUCH A JOURNEY OF ROMEO LOOKING FOR LOVE. AND MINDLESS TAKES CHARGE OF HARMONY IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA AND HARMONY PLAY. AS A WOMAN CHARACTER BUT HARMONY WITH IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA AND BASICALLY TRACKS THAT THE PLOT OF ROAMING JULIET ALL THE WAY THROUGH FOR THE MOST PART IN ROMEO AND JULIET THEY DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT WHY THE MIGHT TO YOUR CATHOLICS ARE FEUDING. IN A RACE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHY OUR NEIGHBORHOOD A FEW THERE SO WE DID A BACKSTORY WHAT ARE PRO LAW IT TALKED ABOUT OUR PARENTS BEING FRIENDS. AND THEN AT SOME POINT THEY SEPARATED BUT THAT MISCOMMUNICATION LED TO A DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CITIES AND AT THE END OF THE PLAY. OUR PARENTS CONFRONT EACH OTHER AND BEING ME IN HARMONY STEP UP AND SAY YABE IS LEFT TODAY WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH OR WITHOUT YOU. AND I WAS LIKE A CALL TO ACTION TO THE COMMUNITY SO THERE'S A HAPPY ENDING. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL IN IRAQ OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN. DID YOU DID YOU END UP GETTING A LOT OF FOLKS FROM. FROM NORTH AND CENTRAL. I'D SHOW UP TO SEE THE PLAY AND I WAS WITH ERNIE. WE INTERACTION WITH THEM ON THE STUFF. OF A LOT OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS FROM THEIR FACES A LOT OF THEM CAME IN A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE I WORK WITH WAS FROM CENTRAL SOUTH RICHMOND SO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS CAME. SO. THE FEW INTERACTIONS THAT I HAD WAS IN DURING THAT NIGHT BECAUSE AT NIGHT WAS CRAZY WITH RUNNING AROUND. PICTURES AND ALL THAT BUT WHEN A DOCUMENTARY CAME OUT AND IT WAS PREMIERED IN. ELSE READ ALL THE SAME SCHOOL THAT WE STAYED TO PLAY A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM NORTH AND CENTRAL SOUTHSIDE WAS THERE AND THEY CAME TO ME AT ONE TIME. AND WAS TALKING TO ME IT WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THE WHOLE CITY NEED TO SEE THIS FILM AND IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO I MET FROM US INTERESTS ME WAS TALKING TO ME WHILE MY COUSINS FROM NOR FRICTION WAS SAYING.

MEDIA LOVING FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW THIS IS NEEDED THEY APPRECIATE IT AND A LOT OF SCREENS IN. CLASSROOM VISITS AND IT'S BEEN BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE AND THE FILMS ARE THE MAKING OF THE PLAY YET OF THE FILM JUST FOLLOW US RIGHT INTO PLAY. A MORE THAN JUST A PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF RACE IN CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU GUYS ALL TELL US WHAT YOUR NEXT PROJECTS ARE GONNA BE. WITH WITH NEXT ON THE PLATE. THERE IS THE. THERE IS A CONSENSUS CHINATOWN THERE IS A. SCIVATION PROJECT THAT IS BASED ON THIS SO THIS IS A STANDALONE FILM AND THE NEXT IS GOING TO BE EPISODIC IT'S. SEASONS EVERY SERIES HAS EIGHT EPISODES AND EVERY EFFORT PAID EPISODES IS OPPOSE FOCUS ON AN INDIVIDUAL IN CHINATOWN. SO THAT'S ONE. I ALSO SERVED LIFE STORIES AND YEAH AND FOR INSTANCE.

BY SAYING THAT PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THESE GIRLS THESE ARE TWO WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL OF TWIN GIRLS I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM THEIR MOM HAD RECENTLY DIED HERE'S FIVE DOLLARS EVERY MONTH THAT I CAN BRING AND FOR YOU. AND SO SHE NEVER HAD THAT CLOSURES NEVER HAD THAT CONNECTION WITH THEIR DAD SO THAT'S ONE OF THE STORES. YEAH ABOVE AVERAGE YOU CHRIS BECAUSE NOTHING. I. WON'T RIGHT NOW I'M I'M I'M WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS. A BIT OF A GANG ISSUE THERE. DOWN IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SO IT'S IN ON YOUR WAY. ACTUALLY HAS ONE THE LARGEST. CONCENTRATION IDENTIFIED GANG MEMBERS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. SORT LOOKING AT DOING SOME PROGRAMMING WITH THOSE YOU. I KNOW. TAGGING AND GRAFFITI IS A BIG. PERCEIVED PROBLEM THERE. I REALLY LOVE THE IDEA OF DOING SOME SORT OF HUMANITIES PROJECT WHERE. WE GET A CHANCE TO. LOOK AT THAT THING THAT'S PERCEIVED AS A BLIGHT OR PROBLEM AND. FIND OUT WHAT IS A MEAN WHAT IS A. WHAT IS THAT GRAFFITI MEAN TO THE PEOPLE DOING IT HIM AND WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY EITHER THE FOR THEMSELVES OR? TO OTHERS AND WHAT WE NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT IT. ART WAS SORT OF HER BY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING HEARING I THINK NEXT WEEK THIS COMMITTEE ON. ON TUESDAY RELATING TO VETERANS IN ARTS AND HEALING PROP PROPERTIES AND PRINCIPLES. AND IT WAS SORT OF. I HAVE YOU SEEN. SOME INTERESTING PARALLELS IN TERMS OF PTSD AT CENTER BETWEEN. GANG MEMBERS IN GO AWRY AND THE VETERANS COME BACK FROM IRAQ INTO THE SOME INTERESTING PARALLELS A. LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF THEM IN VERY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES BUT I CAN ONLY SPEAK AS A AS A I THINK AN AUDIENCE MEMBER I'VE I'VE DEFINITELY. I'VE HEARD A COUPLE NPR PIECES ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE GROWN UP IN IN GANG AREAS THAT. THEY EXHIBIT THE SAME SYMPTOMS OF PTSD TO WAR WHICH IS HEARTBREAKING. YEAH I'M. MMHM. THAT'S A WITH YOUR NEXT PROJECT. I'M A PART OF SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE'S PROJECTS SO I DON'T WANT TO NAME THOSE BUT MIND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A COLLECTION OF POEMS THAT WOULD DOCUMENT A STORY. AM OF GROWING UP IN RICHMOND AND WITH THOSE POEMS I PLAN TO WRITE A SMALL PLACE SO EACH POEM AND INTO A VISUAL TO EACH POLE. EACH VIDEO ON TELLING THE SAME STORY BUT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF THE WHOLE. HOWEVER YOU HAVE TO KEEP. ON THINKING ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT A SHAKESPEARE PLAY LAND YOU CAN RIP OFF OF. HAMLET AND. YOU KNOW. I WAS SUGGESTED TO DO ALL FELLOW YEAH. THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA BUT I DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THEIR LOVE BUT FROM WHAT PEOPLE TELL ME SO. WELL. THERE'S A GREAT FILM. THAT WAS MADE OF IT NOT TOO LONG AGO. HAVE YOU KNOW HAS HAS YOUR WORK BEEN ON FETID OR EXAMINE BY ANY OF THE SHAKESPEARE FESTIVALS OR. THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER THAT IS IF I SEE THAT THE CLUB DOWN IN SAN DIEGO THERE'S NUMBER SIX VESSELS IN LA THIS TO ACTUALLY FESTIVAL IN IT. IS THERE BEEN ANY. INTERACTION BETWEEN A THOSE FESTIVALS AND. AND YOUR WORK NOT NECESSARILY THE FESTIVALS BUT I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS WHO. PARTICIPATE IN ARRANGED A COW SHAKES. SOME ACTORS THERE WAS LIGHT WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO THIS OR. STAGES HERE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS TAUGHT THE AND SO I HAVEN'T REALLY PURSUED IT AND SOMEONE TO THINK ABOUT I I YOU KNOW I I. WELL LET'S LET'S GET SOME VISIT PEOPLE IN THE ROOM IN MY FIELD AFTER THAT SO. I WILL GREAT REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY GUYS FANTASTIC WORK AND AND REALLY DOES SPEAK TO THE THE POWER OF THIS. THIS THIS. OF HUMANITY SO. IS THAT A YES THANK YOU. ALRIGHT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR. THE SECOND PART OF PANEL TWO OF OUR WONDERFUL STORY TELLERS I WE'VE GOT DOCTOR BE DONE CHANDRA ROY HE WAS ASSOCIATE CHAIR OF ENGLISH AT. AND ALSO THE FACT THE DIRECTOR THE PRISON PROGRAM AT CAL STATE LA. AND. AND. DOCTOR ROY WILL WILL SPEAK A BIT ABOUT. WORDS AND CAGED AND WE'VE ALSO GOT MARIAN POWELL WHO'S HERE I SHE'S AN AUTHOR AND A FORMER JOURNALIST WITH LA TIMES IN NEWSDAY AND ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT. DEMOCRACY IN THE FIELDS. SO WE'RE REAL EXCITED TO HAVE. THE TWO HERE. SO WE'LL START WITH YOU DOCTOR RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN IN THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US AND IT'S BEEN. VERY INSPIRING AND ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO THOSE. RESPONSE FAMILIES BEFORE US. I AM SO AS YOU MENTION ON THAT ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT CAL STATE LA BUT MOST OF THE WORK I DO NOW IS IN. LOS ANGELES COUNTY PRISON AT LANCASTER WE HAVE A BE A PROGRAM THAT RIGHT NOW THE ONLY BE I PROGRAMMED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT STOOL IN A PRISON. AND WE HAVE A HUMANITIES. PROGRAM AND ALL ITS PROGRAM CALLED WOOD DUNG CAGED WHICH ARE ALL ALONG WITH THE MEN OF THE ORDER THAT THE FOUNDERS OF AND WE GOT OUR INITIAL FUNDING FROM CAROL HUMANITIES THAT GOT THE WHOLE THING OFF THE GROUND. AND WHAT WE DO IN THE PROGRAM WAS ON CAGED IS. IT REAL WAS REALLY BORN FROM THE IDEA THAT. ONCE YOU SPEND SOME TIME IN PRISON ON. BEEN TEACHING IN THERE FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS NOW. YOU REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY ON TOLD STORIES AND POWERFUL VOICES IN IN PRISON AND SO WHAT'S UNCAGED AS A PLATFORM FOR THOSE. VOICES TO BE HEARD BY THE PUBLIC AND TO INTERACT WITH THE WITH THE PUBLIC. AND IT'S FOUNDED UPON THE BELIEF THAT STORIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAL INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND IMAGINE NEW COLLECTIVE FUTURE. SO WE TRIED TO HAVE STORYTELLING EXPERIENCES THE ALL BASED IN THE PRISON BUT ALSO BASED IN THE COMMUNITIES FROM THE MAN FROM WHERE THE MEN. CAME TO PRESENT AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE CAN. DO SOME KIND OF COLLECTIVE HEALING TOGETHER AND AND AND HELP KIDS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY BE ON THE PART OF THE ENDED UP IN PRISON. OR INVOLVED IN GANGS IN SOUTH LA IN THAT KIND OF STUFF TO IMAGINE ALTERNATIVES TO THAT AND SO THE STORYTELLING PROCESS BECOMES. A WAY OF DOING IT MUCH LIKE IT WAS HERE IN. THE ANTI TALK ABOUT EARLY ON. SO IN THAT SENSE AND I'M I'M KINDA TALKING ABOUT LITERATURE IN ITS MOST EXPENSIVE SENTENCE SAYS THAT AS A. AS A AS A WAVE INCLUDING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES SPELLING TELLING STORIES OF PUBLIC HUMANITIES PROJECT RATHER THAN GOING INTO PLACES AND. NECESSARY TO JIM CANONICAL WORKS OF THAT KIND OF THING. AND BECAUSE THE GOAL OF OUR WORK WITH WHAT'S ON CAGED IS TO COLLAPSE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PRISON AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AND TO STRESS WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON AS HUMAN BEINGS OUR OUR APPROACHES IS COLLABORATIVE AND DIALOGICAL AS AS POSSIBLE. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE. MY STUDENTS AT CAL STATE LA. ONE OF WHOM IS HERE ACTUALLY TO TO BE POP THE HEARING. EDIT AND GIVE FEEDBACK AND ENGAGE WITH THE PRISON RIGHTS IN WHO. OFTEN YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE MEN GO TO PRISON THE DEAN DOWN TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE WRITE TO THEM THEY'VE BECOME DISENGAGED FROM THEIR FAMILY SO THIS IS A WAY OF INTERACTING ABOUT SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IN. THE HUMANITIES IS THAT BRIDGE THAT ENABLES THESE VERY DISPARATE LIVES TO BE CONNECTED THROUGH THESE DIALOGUES. WE'VE HAD ACTORS PERFORM DRAMATIC READINGS OF WRITINGS. IN PUBLIC SETTINGS WE'VE HAD. WOMAN PHOTOGRAPHERS THERE OR ON THE WEBSITE COME IN AND TAKE PULL TRAITS OF THE MEN AND WE HAVE A. EVENT COMING UP AN EXHIBIT COMING UP IN JUNE AT CAL STATE LA. WE HAVE A LETTER WRITING PROGRAM. THAT'S THE GOVERNOR I GET A COPY OF A BOOK THEIR LINE NO YEAH. YEAH. IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOUR BOSS WAS. AND AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS IS A SIZE TO USE THE HUMANITIES THESE ARE SOME OF THE PORTRAITS THAT GOING TO BE EXHIBITED. OUR UPCOMING EVENT THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE SEAS TO. HUMANOIDS TO GIVE A VOICE TO PRISONERS WHO REALLY ARE KIND OF MARGINALIZED FROM ALSO SOUGHT TO IN SO MANY WAYS PHYSICALLY PRISONS ARE VERY ISOLATED LOCATIONS IN THE HIGH DESERT AND PLACES LIKE THAT. AND. OBVIOUSLY THE NATURE OF A PRISON IS IS ONE OF NOT ALLOWING COMMUNICATION AND SO FOR MANY OF THE MEN IN THESE PHOTOS THAT YOU SEE HERE THIS IS THE FIRST MEANINGFUL WAY THEY'VE BEEN I WOULD SAY INTERACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. FOR YEARS. I'M. AND I JUST KIND OF ENUMERATE WHAT WE FOUND THE HUMANITIES IN PARTICULAR TO BE VALUABLE FOR IN IN IN THIS DIALOGUE. I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS. HUMANITIES ALLOW US TO SEE WHY THE STATIC BY MENTION OF VOICE MASSES NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY BUT HOW YOU SAY IT. THE THERE'S DIGNITY THAT COMES FROM CLAIM IN ONE'S INDIVIDUAL VOICE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT IT IT'S IT'S AFFIRMATIVE AND. GIVES A SENSE OF DIGNITY. THE EMPATHY COMES FROM LISTENING IN OR READING OTHER PEOPLE'S STORIES. WITH CASH. AND THE POSITIVE SOCIAL CHANGE CAN BEGIN WITH THE STORY STORYTELLING PROCESS EVERYTHING WE SEE IN THIS ROOM EVERYTHING WITH POLITICS AT SOME POINT IS AN IMAGINED POSSIBILITY. SO THE HUMANITIES. GIVE US THAT FRAMEWORK TO IMAGINE ALL THE POSSIBILITIES THAN BEING A GANG MEMBER WILL GO TO PRISON LIKE YOUR YOUR FAMILY MAY HAVE THOUGHT. I'M AM WITHOUT THE HUMANITIES I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH A LOT THE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO MAKE IN WORDS ON OCCASIONAL THE PRODUCTION. SO TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS. BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A KIND OF IMPORTANT WORDS TO OUR PROJECT AND AND THIS GOES ALL THE WY DOWN TO THE KIND OF MICRO DECISIONS WE MAKE IN ALL PROJECTS SO IN THE BOOK. WE ENDED UP SPENDING MORE OF THE CAST HUMANITIES GRANT THEN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD ON ON PRINTING BECAUSE WE WANTED TO USE REALLY HIGH QUALITY PIPE. ONCE I TOOK THE PAPER SAMPLES INTO THE PRISON WHERE WE WOULD PRODUCE IN THE BOOK. YOU KNOW. MANY OF THE LAW FOR THAT PROGRAM AS IT NEVER TOUCHED A PIECE OF PAPER LIKE THAT BEFORE. AND SO LIKE FOR ALLAH IS THEY JUST YOU KNOW TOUCHING THE PAPER AND IT AND IT SIGNALLED SOMETHING TO THEM THAT THIS STORY IS THE WORST THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PRINTED ON THIS. ARE OF WORTH AND AND SO THAT WAS KIND OF HUMAN VALUE THAT CAME FROM THAT DECISION SO THERE WERE NUMEROUS KIND OF THE. DECISIONS WE MAKE THROUGH THE PROJECT. SUCH AS THAT. ENDS UP JUST THE KIND OF. WE SAW BROUGHT THEIR FACES INTO THE ROOM BUT I ALWAYS FEEL AT A LATE TO. UNEASY SPEAK IN BEHALF OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S A COLLECTIVE AND THE MEN IN PRISON REALLY CO CREATED WITH ME AS MUCH AS AS MUCH AS ME OBVIOUSLY. THEY CAN'T PHYSICALLY BE HERE TO SPEAK SO I WANTED TO READ A FEW OF THE WORDS OF THE IMPACT. THAT THE PROGRAM HAS HAD ON THEM. AND. I AUSTIN TO WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THE HUMANITIES. MEANT TO THEM IN IN IN. IN RESPONSE TO THIS HEARING. SO THIS IS FROM ANDREW KICKING HORSE WHO'S ONE OF OUR. NATIVE AMERICAN PRISON IS AT LANCASTER. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER MY INSIGHT AS TO WHY THE HUMANITIES MATTER. TWO OF THEM PRISON IS A SIMPLY DISREGARDED IN WAREHOUSE WITHOUT REFLECTION. WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES FEED THE SPIRIT IN A WAY THAT NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE. THEM REALIZE THAT THEY ARE SOMEONE AND NOT JUST THE CONVICTED FELON. NO LONGER DEFINED BY MISTAKES WE CAN REGAIN AND AND DIGNIFY THOUGHT FOREVER LOST BECAUSE OF OUR CONVICTIONS. THE HUMANITIES REBIRTH THE SPIRIT AND ENABLE ONE TO GROW SPIRITUALLY INTELLECTUALLY AND MORE HUMANELY. ANDREW KICKING HORSE TRUCK TOLL. LIFE WITHOUT PRISON THAT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE PRISON THE LANCASTER. JUST READ A COUPLE MORE TESTS OKAY. THIS IS FROM A FAMILY MEMBER HAS SOME AND SHE'S FROM STOCKTON. AND. HER SON IS INCARCERATED WITH LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE IN A PROGRAM. SO SHE DROVE DOWN TO LA FOR THE FOR THE EXHIBIT. MY HUSBAND AND I DRIVE DOWN TO LA ON SATURDAY TO SEE YOUR EXHIBIT. I WAS SO I WANTED TO BE THERE FOR THE GRAND OPENING BUT I HAD TO WORK ON SUNDAY MORNING AND I LIVE IN STOCKTON SO I COULDN'T STUDY. HOWEVER I HAD TO SEE IT. IN A WAY I WAS GLAD TO BE ALONE. EXHIBIT WAS EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL FOR ME. MY SON'S POST CODES WERE ON THE WALL AND I KNOW MANY OF THE MEN YOU REPRESENTED. THE ROOM'S ATMOSPHERE BEGAN TO CHANGE WHEN I ENTERED TO A CONFLICT IN AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF MELANCHOLY PASSION DESPAIR HIDING REMORSE SADNESS AND SORROW. AND MOST OF ALL HOPE. THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MEN WAS MET MAJESTIC HONEST THEM RULE BEAUTIFUL. THE ARTWORK FROM THE MAN WAS LIKEWISE BEAUTIFUL. YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE PAIN IN EVERY STROKE OF PIE. BETWEEN THE SLAVES OF THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND TODAY SLAVES MAKING FIVE CENTS AN HOUR WORKING FOR FREE IS SURREAL AND SCREAMS FOR HELP. ACCOUNT SEND OFF DOCTOR ROY THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS FOR PRESENTED OUR LOVE ONES AS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. AND JUST ONE LOSS ONE FROM JOHN MANNING WHO IS IT. FEATURED IN A KNOT AND ALL BOOKING OFFICE BOOK. BEEN PUBLISHED IN THIS EXHIBIT IS A HIGHLIGHT OF THE YEAR FOR ME. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY THAT WOULD BE WORTHY OF PRINTED. BUT IT IS NICE THAT THIS IS HAPPENED. MY HOPE IS THAT THE PUBLIC WILL HEAR THE WORDS IS INTENDED THAT WE ARE HUMAN. WE'VE MADE BAD DECISIONS AND HOPE FOR A CHANCE TO RETURN TO THE PUBLIC SOME TIGHT. I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THE PUBLIC WHO READS AND SEES THE CHANGES. IN ONE'S WHO'VE PARTICIPATED IN WORDS ON THE PAGE WILL REALIZE THAT WE HAVE DEFINITELY CHANGED. WE ARE WORTHY OF A SECOND LOOK AS MANY OF US HAVE SPENT TWENTY YEARS OR MORE CONSTANTLY SEEKING SELF REHABILITATION. NOT BECAUSE OF OUR SURROUNDINGS INSPIRED TO THEM. LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE CAUSES PEOPLE TO BECOME EXTREMELY HOPELESS AND DESPONDENCY BECOMES A NORMAL LIVING CONDITIONS. HOWEVER MANY OF US CONSTANTLY RISES ABOVE THE MARK SEEKING SELF IMPROVEMENT AND UPON OURSELVES TO EXHIBITS LIKE THIS ONE ONLY SERVES TO KEEP HOPE ALIVE. I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK SO HARD TO ALLOW SO VOICE IMPRINTS AND ALL. WITHOUT THESE PEOPLE WE'VE MET NEVER BEEN HURT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THOUGH I'M RECOVERING MY HUMANITY. DAY BY DAY. THANK YOU FOR READING GERMANY. THANK YOU DOCTOR. THIS PROBLEM. SO I'M A I'M A CLASSICS MAJOR AND I ACTUALLY WAS A TOOK A CLASS WITH MARTHA NUSSBAUM SO MY HUMANITIES ROOTS GO GO BACK TO TO YOUR START. ON AND I'M A DISCIPLE OF BILL DEVERELL FROM WHOM I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE ART OF BEING A HISTORIAN. SO. AND AND THE PROJECT THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT I THINK IS MORE HISTORY BASED AND THEN SOME. HOW DO I DO THIS OKAY? ARE WE THERE. I SPENT. THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE RESEARCHING WRITING ABOUT CAESAR COVERS IN THE UNITED FARMWORKERS INTO THE BIOGRAPHY OF CESAR CHAVEZ AND WAS CONTACTED BY A PHOTOGRAPHER. WAIT CAN WE GO BACK. IT DOESN'T MATTER. BUT YET JUST ABOUT PERFECT. COVETED BY PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WEIGHS HAS RETIRED AND WAS GOING THROUGH. BOXES OF NEGATIVES THAT SHE HAD SHOT IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN SHE WAS A STUDENT AT SAN FRANCISCO ART INSTITUTE. AND CALLED ME AND SAID YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THESE PHOTOS. AND DESPITE HAVING SEEN MANY MANY PHOTOS OF THAT ERROR IN THAT PERIOD I NEVER SEEN PICTURES LIKE THE ONES THAT MAYBE PALM TUCK BECAUSE. SHE WAS INTERESTED ALTHOUGH THIS PICTURE IS OBVIOUSLY OF OF CHAVEZ. SHE WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PART OF THE MOVEMENT. AND I'M GOING TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH LED TO TO TO THIS PROJECT. ON THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT WAS PASSED IN AND SIGNED BY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN IN JUNE OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ONE OF HIS MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS MAKING CALIFORNIA THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. IN WHICH FARM WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND JOIN UNIONS FROM WORKERS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT SO THIS UNLEASHED. A SORT OF SUMMER OF FRENETIC pPREPARED FOR THESE ELECTIONS WHICH WE'RE GONNA HAPPEN SHOULD NEVER. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE AND MIMI SPENT THE SUMMER IN SALINAS FOLLOWING THE WORKERS AS THEY GOT READY. FOR SHE'S THE PHOTOGRAPHER YES SORRY MIMI PALM. THAT'S NOT RIGHT HARROWING. SORRY. CAN YOU FIX IT. RIGHT YOU DISADVANTAGE OF SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE SHOTS THAT WE ARE ON OUR WEBSITE. WHICH WE PUT TOGETHER AS PART OF THIS PROJECT THAT WAS FUNDED BY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BUT CESAR CHAVEZ WALKED FROM SAN DIEGO. ACROSS OR UP AND DOWN THE COAST UP UP THE COAST BASICALLY. ENDING IN SALINAS AND THEN LATER ON IN SACRAMENTO THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN ORDER TO PUBLICIZE THESE ELECTIONS THAT WERE GOING TO TAKE PLACE. SO SHE SHOT THOUSANDS OF PICTURES AND WE BEGAN TO GO THROUGH THEM AND PUT TOGETHER THE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED SHE DIDN'T HAVE NAMES OF PEOPLE SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY WERE FOR THE MOST PART. OTHER THAN THE ONES WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZABLE LIKE TRAVIS AND WORK AND SO ON. WHAT SHE CAPTURED IN A WAY THAT I THINK? NO ONE ELSE I'VE SEEN DEED IS WHAT THIS MEANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LEARNING HOW TO ORGANIZE AND AND AND BEING ABLE TO. EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS STOPPED THERE FOR SUCK ON THEIR RIGHTS TO. TO US TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT MOST OF THEM HAD NEVER. DONE BEFORE REMOTE MOST MANY OF THE FARM WORKERS AND NEVER VOTED IN THEIR LIVES IN ANY KIND OF ELECTION MUCH LESS A UNION ELECTION THE TEATRO CAMPESINO LUIS VALDEZ. WAS A PART OF THIS THEY PERFORMED AND IN SORT OF LITTLE FARM TOWNS UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHEN SHE CAPTURED THIS WHOLE RECORD. SO WE BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS THE WAY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER IN A WAY INTO THAT WOULD CAPTURE THIS HISTORY AND MAKE IT MEANINGFUL TO PEOPLE TODAY. AND BE ABLE TO SORT OF TELL THE STORY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL AROUND MANY OF THEM. AND BUT BUT HAD NO SENSE OF THEIR OWN HISTORY IN SOME LEVEL BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT CAPTURED THIS IN IMAGES. AHEAD SO. THE. THERE'S A SECTION ON THE WEBSITE THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW TO BUILD THE UNION AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY WERE DOING WHICH WERE LIKE THIS. BUILDING. UP ON FLAGS HAVING RALLIES. KEEP GOING. MEETINGS ORGANIZING AND REALLY GETTING A SENSE OF THEIR OWN POWER. ON AND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN DESTINY. AND-THEIR FUTURE. ON. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE VERY FIRST ELECTION THAT WAS EVER HELD IN THE FIELDS. AND THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST JUST EVEN IN THE FIRST WEEKS. AND THIS MAN HERE IS ON HIS NAME IS. A SELF ESTEEM THOUGH. ARM REVERSE AND HE WAS ONE OF THE ORGANIZED A FEW SHE FOLLOWED AROUND HE WAS A LETTUCE CUTTER. GO TO THE NEXT ONE AND THAT'S MARGOT BUSTAMANTE ON THE RIGHT SIDE HE'S HAVING HOUSE MEETING THESE WERE LETTERS CUTTERS WHO. JOINED THE UNION AND THEN FOUND THEMSELVES HAVING A TALENT FOR LEADERSHIP IN BEING ABLE TO ORGANIZE. A CAN GO TO THE NEXT ONE CURLERS. YEAH YEAH ON THIS IS NOT AS BAD THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S A LISTING OF TODAY IN THE AT. AND THE OTHER GUYS MARIELS BROTHER MARIO AND SHOVE A GO BACK. STAY THERE FOR A SEC. THEY HAD NO PICTURES OF THEIR FATHER THEY HAD TO FOLLOW THEIR FATHER INTO THE UNION THEY HAD NO PHOTOS OF HIM AND WE WENT AROUND AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF THIS PROJECT AND SHOW THESE PICTURES TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE FOLKS IN THE PICTURES. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SORT OF THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THERE FOR TO SEE WHETHER THEY COULD SEE THEIR FATHER IN ANY OF THESE PHOTOS. AND THEN THE NEXT PHOTO IS FITS HIM IN THE HOT OVER IN THE MIDDLE SIDE SO WE. AS IN DOING THIS SORT OF SAID THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THEIR OWN HISTORY IN A WAY THAT THEY NEVER HAD IT BEFORE. THAT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO PRESENT THIS. AND. BECAUSE OF GETTING THE GRAPHIC HOW HUMANITIES WHICH ALLOWED US% TO SET UP A WEBSITE THAT REALLY TELL THE STORY AND BE ABLE TO SPREAD THE WORD. SO THAT'S RATHER SELL SAITO IN THE MIDDLE ON SHE'S ANOTHER ORGANIZER WHO IS THE LATEST CUTTER AND LEARN HOW TO ORGANIZE AND WENT ON TO HAVE ANOTHER LIFE AND WE WENT AND TRACK THESE PEOPLE DOWN WE FOUND ROSE. IN FAMILIES IN. ARIZONA NEXT. FIND THIS WAR MORE-ROWS IN THE FIELDS THAT'S WAS IT THEN. AND. ONE MORE. THAT'S ROSA FILING PAPERS FOR ELECTION CONFRONTING YOU KNOW REALLY LEARNING AND THIS IS WHEN WE FOUND ROSA WITH MARIO AND SHOWING HER THE PHOTOS THESE PEOPLE HAVE FAMILIES WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THEIR HISTORY HER CHILDREN REALLY DID KNOW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY SORT OF ANCIENT HISTORY. JOSE RENTERIA AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OF TAKE THESE PEOPLE RECORD ORAL HISTORIES WITH THEM FIND IN SOME CASES RECORDS OF. TAPES THAT THEY HAD MADE ON THE THE GUY IN THE BACK IS NAMED SUBPOENA LOPEZ AND THEN WE BROUGHT THEM ALL TO SALINAS FOR AN EVENT THAT WAS JOINTLY SPONSORED WITH THE NATIONAL STEINBECK CENTER. ON THAT ALLOW THEM TO TELL THEIR STORIES FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY IT WAS THERE WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE IS A SORT OF A MULTI GENERATIONAL CROWD AND THEY WERE STUDENTS THERE IT WAS A REALLY. A WAY OF PASSING ON THE HISTORY TO FUTURE GENERATIONS AND IN A WAY THAT IS BEING USED NOW IN THE SCHOOLS SO IS IT WAS AN EFFORT TO SORT OF. BOTH CAPTURE SOME OF THE HISTORY AND AND TIE IT TO THE PRESIDENT. IN A SENSE OF. THE ORAL HISTORIES ON THE SITE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THEIR LIVES WERE CHANGED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. AND. AND HOW WE. EAT EAT EAT ENABLED THEM TO ALSO MOVE OUT OF THE FIELDS IN MOST CASES AND TO LEARN WHAT SORT OF ORGANIZING AND POWER WAS ABOUT. SO WE SORT OF WE WERE THREE THE THREE OF US WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER MIMI PUMP THE PHOTOGRAPHER ME AND THE WAY OUR WEB DESIGNER. WE WERE ALL INDEPENDENT. ARTISTS AND AND WRITERS SO WE SORT OF HAD NO RESOURCES TO DO THIS WITHOUT. WITHOUT THE KIND OF GRANT THAT WE GOT AND IT'S NOW. A RESOURCE THAT'S OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO USE FOR FOR MANY YEARS. I LOVE IT I LOVE IT VERY VERY COOL. I'M. YOU KNOW I I WISH WE COULD ALL OVER THIS RECENT LIST A. DOCUMENTARY BECAUSE IT'S NOT OK OCCUR. HOW MUCH DO YOU END UP COORDINATING A BIT WITH THE THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE HAD NO SUCH OBVIOUS NATIONAL STARK SIDE A LITTLE BIT I MEAN I WAS INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE IT ACTUALLY THEY WERE WORKING ON THAT WHEN I WAS DOING THE BOOK AND I WENT? AROUND TO SOME OF THE HEARINGS IN THE SITES AND SO ON AND. I MEAN I'M NOT A FATHER SOME THERE ARE A COUPLE HISTORIAN TO BE INVOLVED WITH. THE PARK SERVICE IN TRYING IT'S A LITTLE BIT THE PARK SERVICE IS DOING IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRAVIS FOUNDATION HOW IT'S SET UP. SO THEY'RE SORT OF SOME NAVIGATION OF. HOW THAT PROCESS IS GOING THEY'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF IT? HE'S BEEN MINUTES THE SITE'S BEEN. IN THE WORKS FOR QUITE SOME WHAT A QUESTION TIME AND HE'S YEAH I MEAN THEY TOOK OVER THE SITE WAS THERE BEFORE IT WAS RUN BY THE TIME HIS FOUNDATION AND IT'S STILL SORT OF RUN BY THEM BUT THE PARK SERVICE OWNS THE PROPERTY NOW AND SO THEY'RE SORT. OF GRADUALLY. PUTTING UP MORE INFORMATIONAL. MATERIAL AND SO ON AND THEY'RE A LOT THEY DID THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE DID A WHOLE SURVEY OF HISTORIC SITES AROUND THE STATE FORTY ACRES IN DELANO AND NATIONAL TOWN HALL AND ALL THAT. BUT THAT'S SORT OF DIED WITH THE LAST ADMINISTRATION. AHA. OKAY. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE YEAH I MEAN I I KEEP YOU KNOW I I I LOOK I GOT TO WATCH MAN'S IN OUR GROUP I WENT THERE. WHEN IT WAS FIRST. REQUIRED BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND IT WAS THERE'S VERY LITTLE THERE. AND THEN THE LAST TIME I WENT IT WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS. EXTRAORDINARY MUSEUM OF A CRAVING TALKING ABOUT ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULT ISSUES OF. FREE SPEECH AND. YEAH CIVIL RIGHTS AND ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE STORY OF. OF OF. OF THE INTERNMENT. A SYSTEM I JUST I KEEP I KEEP HOPING THAT THAT. THEY'LL PULL SOMETHING SIMILAR TOGETHER HE YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE TERMS OF THE DEAL ARE THAT THEY ARE SORT OF HAVE TO DO IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FAMILY SO THERE'S BEEN. SOME. PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION ON ON THAT BECAUSE THE FAMILY IS A LOT OF CONTROL OVER HOW THE STORIES TOLD YEAH YEAH INTERESTING. ALL RIGHT. BY THE WAY YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR ROY ADD CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD IS THAT. IMPORT I I SEE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU SPENT SOME TIME WORKING ON IT YOU KNOW HE'S FROM MY DISTRICT ADD. AND. HIS LONG TIME PARTNER DON CARTY COURSE PAINTED THE GOVERNORS A PORTRAIT WHICH YOU MUST GO SEE BUYER HERE IN THE BUILDING. HE'S HE ALSO SUBMITTED SO HE'S. GOT A PORTRAIT OF GUS VAN SANT OF MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO AND OTHER FILMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON DISPLAY AS PART OF OUR SENATE. ART. COLLECTION. SO DID THEIR THEIR X. DIRTY SURRENDERING STORY THAT DON AND AND AND CHRISTOPHER AND. AND SO IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC WHAT WHAT GOT YOU SO INTERESTED IN IN PRISON ISSUES HOW DID YOU END UP. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE THE OTHER. IS ANOTHER WONDERFUL BRIT WHO'S WORKING ON THESE ISSUES THAT. YOU KNOW A GOOD FRIEND WHO IS NOW WORKING WITH A CYBER AT WHAT WILL YEAH I KNOW. WE WORK TOGETHER. SO SHE JUST GOT MEMBER THE BRITISH EMPIRE YEAH QUEEN HERSELF AND AND. WHEN I WAS JUST AT THE CEREMONY AT THE BRITISH CONSUL THOUSAND AND YET SHE'S ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY WORK ON ON HEARING ARTS AND. FEAR INTO THE PRISONS AND. AND SO LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY OF HOW YOU ENDED UP IN ON THIS PATH AM WELL I THINK. SEVERN I PROBABLY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I THINK BE IN BROWN AND BRITISH HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT I AM YOU KNOW I'M SURE PRINCE HARRY'S GOT DIFFERENT VIEWS ABOUT PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE IT GIVES YOU AN EXPERIENCE OF BEING MARGINALIZED WHEN YOU'RE GROWING UP IN A AND DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS TO THE STRUCTURE OF POWER IN THAT KIND OF THING. SO I THINK THEORETICALLY MY PHD IN POST COLONIAL STUDIES SO I'D KIND OF UNDERSTOOD THAT PRISON SYSTEM FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. I'M AND THEN BY GROWTH BY GRAPHICALLY HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS AND. WE STARTED A DOG PROGRAM AND THE PRESIDENT. DOGS THAT WERE GONNA BE KILLED. INVOLVED IN DOG RESCUING PEOPLE RESCUED DOGS THAT WOULD GONNA BE KILLED WE. ESSENTIALLY STARTED AT A TRAIN IN A SHELTER IN THE PRISON AND SO FROM NOW I START TO TEACH IN CLASSES ABOUT THE HEALING POWER OF HAVING THE ANIMALS IN THAT. AND THEN YOU KNOW ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND THEN. EACH TIME I WENT IN I ALSO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE KEPT BUILDING WE. SO NOW WE HAVE A DEGREE IN THERE IN A BOOK AND. WHAT KINDS OF STUFF? SO YEAH IT'S VERY COLD HOW MANY HOW MANY OF THE OTHER PRISONERS ARE. AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THE OPPORTUNITY. WE. SO IN THE FORMAL EDUCATION PAUL AND WE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THE NUMBERS ARE A LOT SMALLER WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE IN EACH CO HOLE AND WE'VE. GOT TWO COHORTS RIGHT NOW SO FIFTEEN THE DEGREE PROGRAM RIGHT UP IN THE WOODS ON CAGE PROGRAM WE HAVE. PROBABLY OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN NOW AND ALL AROUND THE SITE SO I GET LETTERS NOW FROM ALL AROUND PRISONS AROUND THE STATES AND THAT I WILL RUN HE STATE SORT OF HEARD. ABOUT THE PROGRAM SEND IN THEIR RIGHTS IN AND EVEN IF WE CAN'T PUBLISH THE STUFF WE PUT IT UP ON THE WEBSITE AND STUDENTS RIGHT BACK TO THEM. GIVEN RESPONSES TO THAT WORKS THAT THEY FEEL INCLUDED IN WHATEVER WAY WE CAN. RIGHT MISTER WHAT WELL WE WE NEED TO TELL THAT STORY MORE OMINOUS THERE'S SO MUCH MORE INTEREST NOW. IN TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO. TO OUR PRISON SYSTEM AND AND. AND AND THERE'S A LOT MORE INTEREST I THINK ON THE PART OF LEGISLATION THE GOVERNMENT GENERAL TO. TO GET MORE OF THESE KINDS OF TRULY. ANTI RECIDIVIST. AT PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND AND IN TREATING PEOPLE BETTER AND AND MAKING IT MUCH LESS LIKELY THAN END UP BACK IN THE SYSTEM AND. SO I BUY VERY MUCH APPLAUD YOU I'D. FINALLY I'D LOVE TO HEAR. YOUR UPCOMING BOOK ABOUT THE BROWNS. HAVE YOU BEEN INTERVIEWING THE GOVERNOR AND YEAH I HAVE SOME IT'S CALLED UPON TO CALIFORNIA. THIS FAMILY DYNASTY THAT TRANSFORMED THE STATE AND SHAPE THE NATION'S SO IT GOES BACK AND STARTS WITH THE SHOCK MEANS TO THE GOVERNORS TALKS ABOUT TALKS ABOUT RIGHT AND THAT WAS WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED IN IT SO I.

I AM A NEW YORKER SO I MOVED HERE TWO THOUSAND SO I YOU KNOW I CONFESS THAT I I HAD THE NEW YORKERS VIEW OF CALIFORNIA AND THEREFORE I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE IN THE EAST COAST AND YOU KNOW THINK OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW LITTLE IS REALLY UNDERSTOOD ABOUT IT. AND AND WHEN I MOVED HERE I SORT OF ASK PEOPLE WHAT SHOULD I READ AND. THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY BOOKS THAT SORT OF YU KNOW CARRY MIKE WILLIAMS IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION CALIFORNIA BUT IT ENDS IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. SO THIS BOOK IS AN EFFORT TO USE THE FAMILY TO REALLY SORT OF EXPLAIN A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT CALIFORNIA WHAT MATTERS HERE WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. SO THERE'S A LOT ABOUT. EDUCATION IMMIGRATION DEMOGRAPHICS THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT PLACES AND AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE FAMILY YOU KNOW FROM THE GOLD RUSH. ON TO THE PRESENT.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU GUYS REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH REALLY FASCINATES. ME OKAY OUR NEXT PANEL WILL LOOK AT PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS WERE LOOKING AT INSPIRING CULTURAL CONNECTIONS ORGAN AND INTRODUCE JOHN SHAPE AS I SAY ABOUT WHO'S. I BRING ABOUT A PUBLIC LIBRARY. BOARD MEMBER ALSO OF CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES WILL HAVE NINA SIMONS WELL EXACTLY DIRECTOR THAN SANTA CRUZ MUSEUM. OF ART HISTORY. AND ALL OF OUR RESULTS AS WELL WHO'S A PHD AND AND A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND FACULTY COORDINATOR SOCIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE AT BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE AND ALSO A BOARD MEMBER KELLY MANDY SO. WE'LL START WITH YOU AND. OUR C. LIBRARIAN. INDEED. A GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE HERE GENUINE PLEASURE. TO SPEAK ABOUT OF THE HUMANITIES. AND CERTAINLY LIBRARIES AS WELL. AND. I DO HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE OF BEING CITY LIBRARIAN OF LOS ANGELES AHEAD OF THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY AND. EVERY PLEASURE HEADACHE ALL IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE NOW ACTUALLY LOVE IT BEST JOB IN THE WORLD. BUT EVERY SINGLE THAT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER. SOME DAYS ARE TO. COME BUT EVERYONE OF THE SEVENTY THREE LOCATIONS OF THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS A SIGN POSTED PROMINENTLY THAT SAYS WE WELCOME EVERYONE YEAH. AND WE MEAN IT. AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT EVERY ANGELINO FEELS WELCOME AND AT HOME IN OUR LIBRARIES IS CRITICAL. AND REALLY REPRESENTS WHO WE ARE AS AN INSTITUTION AND WHO WE ARE AS A PROFESSION. IN LIBRARIANSHIP. AND HUMANITIES PROGRAMMING IS AN ENORMOUS PART OF THIS MISSION. AND FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S ABOUT TELLING THE STORIES OF CALIFORNIANS AND PROVIDING A PLATFORM TO OUR STATE'S RESIDENCE TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES. AND A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IS VISUALIZING LANGUAGE OAXACA IN LA. A WHICH IS ACTUALLY FEATURED. IN YOUR BOOK TODAY. AS PART OF THE GETTY'S PACIFIC STANDARD TIME LA LA SERIES OF EXHIBITIONS THAT EXPLORE THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND LATIN AMERICA. WE COMMISSIONED AN ARTIST COLLECTIVE IN OAXACA MEXICO TO PAINT SIX MONUMENTAL MURALS THAT WERE INSTALLED IN OUR CENTRAL LIBRARY'S ROTUNDA LAST YEAR. THEY CELEBRATE THE OAXACAN OMMUNITY OF ALLY AND LOOK AT THE WHOLE HAWK AND COMMUNITY IN LA. THROUGH THE LENS OF THESE HAWKEN ARTISTS. AND THE MURALS. ALSO FEATURED THIS. INDIGENOUS OF ZAPOTEC LANGUAGE. EITHER PERMANENT NOW THEY'RE UP THEY WERE TO COME DOWN IN LATE JANUARY WE'VE EXTENDED THE MINT UNTIL AUGUST BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE PAINTED ON. CANVAS AND IT'S IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THAT'S COOL. THEY'RE INCREDIBLY POPULAR AND BEAUTIFUL. BUT JUST HAVING THE MURALS IN THE ROTUNDA. THERE TO VIEW WASN'T ENOUGH. AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES WE HELD DOZENS OF PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES AT OUR LIBRARIES. THAT REALLY CELEBRATED OAXACAN CULTURE. AND NOTABLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MEXICAN AMERICAN POPULATION SO. SHARING THE STORY OF OF THE WALKING COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE CITY. IN THE HUMANITIES ARE AN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL PART OF ALL THAT WE DO IN LIBRARIES CERTAINLY THEY'RE PART OF OUR PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL COLLECTIONS THAT WE OFFER. A BUT AS IMPORTANTLY THERE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES OF OUR LIBRARY. AND THIS IS REALLY PERHAPS MOST EVIDENT IN ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT ADDITION IS THAT WE HAVE AND THAT IS SERVING IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THROUGH OUR NEW AMERICANS INITIATIVE. AND WE STARTED THIS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOCUSING ON LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENTS IN LA. AND HELPING THEM NATURALIZE AND IN  PROGRAM WE CALLED YOUR PATH TO CITIZENSHIP BEGINS AT THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY. AND THE INITIATIVE INVOLVED AN EXPANDED REALLY BEAUTIFULLY. TO SERVE BOTH DOCUMENTED AN UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS WE NOW PROVIDE WORKSHOPS. CITIZENSHIP CLASSES AND ONE ON ONE ASSISTANCE AND HAVING ONGOING HUMANITIES PROGRAMS THAT UNDER THE CULTURAL TRADITIONS. OF OUR CITY'S RESIDENTS AND TELL THEIR STORIES CONNECTS ANGELINA'S TO EACH OTHER IMPROVES CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND IS ALSO STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LIBRARY BECAUSE. PEOPLE WILL COME INTO OUR LIBRARIES. BRANCHES IN CENTRAL LIBRARY FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THEN LEARN ABOUT ALL THE OTHER GREAT RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AND IN MANY CASES INTRODUCE. THE GREAT TRADITION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE U. S.. TO NEW AMERICANS. A AND THIS IS ALSO OF COURSE THE OBJECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA MANATEES LIBRARY INNOVATION LAB. WHICH IS A GRANT PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES TRAINING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO A COURT OF TEN PROGRAMMING LIBRARIANS FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY EACH DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC HUMANITIES PROJECT. AND ALL OF THE PROJECTS ARE ARE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A FOCUS ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ENGAGE THESE COMMUNITIES THROUGH A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AND THE RESULT IS INCREDIBLY CREATIVE. AND UNIQUE PROGRAMS THAT THEY STRENGTHEN TIES TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IN THERE ANOTHER WAY TO WELCOME A NEW PATIENTS TO THE LIBRARY. IN A GLANCE AT THE CURRENT PROGRAM SCHEDULE AT MY LIBRARY ILLUSTRATES THE DIVERSITY OF OUR HUMANITIES PROGRAMS AND YOU'LL SEE THIS IN THE SMALLEST LIBRARIES IN THE STATE AND THE LARGEST AS WELL. BUT A LOOK AT THAT SCHEDULE INCLUDES JAPANESE TAIKO DRUMMING SOUTH INDIAN TEMPLE DANCING A VIOLIN CONCERT FEATURING THE MUSIC OF OF ALL THE IN BOX A LECTURE ON THE ART OF FRIDA KAHLO. AN ART EXHIBIT FEATURING CIVIL RIGHTS ERA PHOTOGRAPHY FEATURING IMAGES OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING DURING HIS VISITS IN LOS ANGELES. A MULTIMEDIA EXPLORATION OF YIDDISH THEATER AND DANCE IN LA. LGBT HISTORY EXHIBITS AND HIP HOP AND SPOKEN WORD PERFORMANCES. AND I EVEN REMEMBER SENATOR ALAN WHEN YOU WERE AT OUR WILL AND ARIEL DURANT BRANCH LIBRARY FOR AN ANNIVERSARY WE EVEN HAD A RUSSIAN DANCE THAT'S RIGHT. THERE SO YEAH EVEN USING IT'S IT'S THE IT'S THERE ALL THE TIME I'VE YOU KNOW I'VE USED THOSE MOVES AT WEDDINGS AND. AND QUITE A FEW TIMES VERY HELPFUL. BUT BOTH LIBRARIES IN THE HUMANITIES ARE AS YOU KNOW AND ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL FOR A VIBRANT HEALTHY CALIFORNIA AND WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER AS THEY DO EVERY DAY AND EVERY LIBRARY ACROSS THE STATE IT'S IT'S REALLY ABSOLUTE MAGIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SPEAK YOU. VERY COOL ALRIGHT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT A SECRET SUPER POWER OF MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S THE POWER TO BRIDGE COMMUNITIES AND I'M USING THIS TERM NOT EUPHEMISTICALLY BUT SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD SOCIAL CAPITAL IN COMMUNITIES. AND WE LIVE IN A VERY DIVIDED WORLD A VERY DIVIDED COUNTRY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEORIZED THAT ONE OF THE CORE REASONS FOR OUR DIVISIONS IS WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BOND WITH PEOPLE. WHO SHARE YOUR RACE GENDER CLASS IDENTITY AND VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BRIDGE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY DIFFERENT FROM YOU? MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GREAT PLACES TO BOND YOU KNOW WE LOVE SEEING FAMILIES ENJOY OUR MUSEUM. BUT WE'VE REALLY DECIDED THAT OUR PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE NOT ON BONDING BUT I'M BRIDGING AND I'M BEING A SPACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN FORM CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE. DIFFERENT AGES DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES I'M I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE RESEARCH ON THE INTERCESSORY OF BRIDGING COMMUNITIES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL COHESION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO LOOKING AT STRANGERS ON THE STREET AND SEEING THEM AS POTENTIAL FRIENDS INSTEAD OF POTENTIAL THREATS. AND ONE OF THE MORE SURPRISING PIECES OF ESEARCH I THINK ABOUT BRIDGING IS THAT ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BRIDGE PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IS THROUGH CREATIVE EXPRESSION MAKING SOMETHING TOGETHER. AND THROUGH SHARING IN CELEBRATING CULTURAL HERITAGE. BECAUSE WHEN WE MAKE SOMETHING TOGETHER WE'RE GETTING COMFORTABLE WHETHER IT'S JUST PASSING THE SCISSORS AND GLUE OR WHETHER IT'S PAINTING THAT MURAL I'M AND WHEN WE SHARE STORIES FROM OUR DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WE START TO SEE THOSE UNEXPECTED CONNECTIONS. THAT BRING US TOGETHER IN EMPATHY AND SHARED UNDERSTANDING I'M AND SO AT OUR MUSEUM IN SANTA CRUZ WE REALLY FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN DESIGN EXPERIENCES TO BRIDGE COMMUNITIES I'M MORE PROUD OF THE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE WHO VISIT EVERY YEAR. BUT WORRY I'M MORE GRATEFUL TO THE TWO THOUSAND LOCAL PARTNERS WE WORK WITH EVERY YEAR HERE JUST FIFTY OF THEM AND I LOOK AT THIS PICTURE I SEE A LIBRARIAN I SEE A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I SEE A BIKE MESSENGER I SEE A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER I SEE PEOPLE REFLECTING VERY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN OUR COUNTY WHO ARE USING THE MUSEUM AS A PLACE TO BUILD BRIDGES ACROSS DIFFERENCES. WE DESIGN INTO THE PROGRAMS WE CO PRODUCED WITH PARTNERS AND WE PHYSICALLY DESIGN INTO THE SPACE CREATING WAYS TO ENCOURAGE AND INVITE PEOPLE TO MEET A STRANGER IN THE EXHIBIT. TO SHARE STORIES AND REFLECTIONS ON ISSUES LIKE THIS IS AN EXHIBIT THAT STUFF RIGHT NOW ABOUT FOOD SECURITY WE'VE DONE PROJECTS ON FOSTER CARE. THIS IS AN EXHIBITION WE JUST OPENED CALLED CBS SCENE VERY SERVICE STILL. IT FEATURES OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PORTRAITS CREATED BY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEY REALLY REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF WHO'S IN OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF WHO'S ON THE WALLS. AND ALSO WHO CREATED THESE PIECES ARE THIS IS A PICTURE. FROM THE OPENING OF JUST A FEW OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE ARTISTS INVOLVED IN THIS EXHIBITION. MEETING EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THIS PROJECT SEEING AND BEING SEEN BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF THIS EXHIBITION. AND SO I'M HERE TODAY. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE LIVE IN A DIVIDED WORLD. IT'S A WORLD THAT THOSE DIVISIONS CAUSED ME A LOT OF STRESS BUT I FIND AND TAKE A LOT OF HOPE IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THESE BRIDGES AND TO CHANGE AND SHIFT THAT DIVISION. THROUGH THESE CULTURAL PROJECTS THROUGH THESE CREATIVE PROJECTS I'M AND I REALLY WANT TO INVITE AND ASK YOU TODAY TO DO TWO THINGS. FIRST TO SUPPORT THIS BRIDGE BUILDING WORK AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY TO HOLD US TO IT BECAUSE FRANKLY YOU HAVE A SUPER POWER THAT WE DON'T HAVE. MUSEUMS IN PARTICULAR OUR FRIENDS IN LIBRARIES ARE PUBLICLY SUPPORTED WHICH IS AWESOME BUT MUSEUMS THEATERS OTHER CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PRIVATE NON PROFITS. FRANKLY IT'S OUR CHOICE WHETHER WE DECIDE TO BE A PLACE THAT BRIDGES OR WHETHER WE DECIDE TO BE A BOND A PLACE FOR A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON AND A CERTAIN KIND OF BACKGROUND. AND ONE PUBLIC MONEY COMES INTO THE PROGRAM IT CHANGES THE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THAT SENSE THAT WE NEED TO NOT JUST BE FOR PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN CLASS BACKGROUND A CERTAIN RACIAL BACKGROUND CERTAIN EDUCATION BACKGROUND. BUT THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD BE PLACES THAT ARE OF BY AND FOR EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M SO I REALLY ASK YOU TODAY AND ALL OF US I YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE CULTURE AND HUMANITIES. TO BUILD BRIDGES AND HOW WE CAN USE THE UNIQUE SUPER POWERS THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH FOR MORE OF THIS KIND OF WORK SO THAT WE HAVE MORE DANTE'S MORE CHRISS MORE JOHNS MORE OF THESE PROJECTS. NOT JUST A FEW ACROSS THE STATE BUT THAT EVERY CULTURAL INSTITUTION FEELS LIKE THIS IS THE WAY THEY CAN AND SHOULD BE WORKING TO BUILD A STRONGER STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH PROFESSOR OF SOUTH. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR ALAN AND FELLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS OLIVER IS ALSO I'M A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND FACULTY COORDINATOR. OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE OF EGGS FOR COLLEGE. HUMANITIES EDUCATION THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES AND CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES ALL PLAY A VITAL ROLE THROUGHOUT OUR GREAT STATE BUT IN PARTICULAR IN RURAL AND DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. RECENTLY APPOINTED ANY H. CHAIRMAN JOHN PARISH PT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO HUMANITIES PROGRAMS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IT'S ON THESE TWO FRONTS EXPANDING ACCESS AND PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT I FOCUS MY OWN WORK AS A HUMANITY SCHOLAR AND ADVOCATE. IN KERN COUNTY ANY AGE HAS INVESTED FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS RECENTLY. AT CSU BAKERSFIELD ANY H. FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY'S NEW ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM.

OTHER RECENT GRANTS INCLUDE CIVIL RIGHTS OR HISTORY PROJECTS AS WELL AS A FRESNO BASED PROJECT FOCUSED ON THAT CITY'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HISTORY OF WEST COAST HIP HOP. AND DANCE CULTURE. THIS MAN IS IMPORTANT THE CENTER VALLEY BECAUSE OF THE REGIONAL DIVERSITY AND ROLL THAT MIGRATION HAS PLAYED IN HUMAN SETTLEMENT. ONE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY HISTORIAN DESCRIBED THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS A RACIAL AND ETHNIC MICROCOSM OF AMERICA. THE REGION'S DIVERSE MIGRATION HISTORIES FROM PRE COLONIAL TIMES THROUGH THE PRESENT ARE ALL HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT YET DISCONNECTED IN THE MINDS OF MANY RESIDENTS. THE REGION IS MARKED BY DISLOCATED INSULAR AND ISLAND COMMUNITIES THAT LINE THE VALLEY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. AND IT'S THE HUMANITIES THAT HELPS TO CONNECT THESE ISLAND COMMUNITIES WITH A BROADER WORLD AND TO FIND COMMON GROUND. CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES AND THE ANY H. HAVE HELPED CULTIVATE A LOCAL LEADERSHIP BASE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE HUMANITY'S ACCESS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. PARTNERSHIPS AMONG AND BETWEEN BIGGER SO COLLEGE CSU BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AND YOU SEE WERE SAID WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE CENTRAL VALUES ACCESS TO HUMANITIES LEARNING EXPERIENCES IS PROPORTIONAL.

IN EFFECT PUTTING THE COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ENSURING THAT REAL FAMILIES IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND NON ENGLISH SPEAKING FAMILIES CAN ACCESS HUMANITIES IS SOMETHING THAT THE ANY H. VALUES AND IS AN APPROACH THAT I HAVE ADOPTED AS PROJECT DIRECTOR. BOTH ARE CRITICAL TO CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT CAN BE SEEN IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN PARTICULAR.

ALL OF THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY HUMANITIES FUNDING. AND THROUGH THE LENS OF THE HUMANITIES EDUCATION AND APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WELL I'M. GOD I I'VE I'M LOOKING YOUR BIO I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT ONE OF THE PROFESSIONALISM PROGRAMS WAS. NINETY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE AND I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO GET UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN DOLLARS OF THERE. THERE IS IT IS IT HAS TO DO SOME SORT OF. YOU KNOW I DIDN'T DO THE MATH ARE HISTORIANS ARE DUE BACK VERY WELL JUST FUNNY THAT'S IN YOUR BY THIS I MEAN I I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME WELL I MEAN I I DISTINCTLY WANTED TO PUT THAT IN BECAUSE BOTH ANY AGE IN CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES HAVE MADE. REALLY TARGETED EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS GETTING PROPORTIONAL FUN YEAH THAT'S A REALLY. I THINK A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT YEAH. I'M. CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOU'RE WORKING ON TO YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT AT BAKERSFIELD HISTORY. FROM NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR. IT'S CALLED MISSISSIPPI WEST CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL US A BIT MORE VIRUS SO MERRIAM'S WORK RIGHT HAS BEEN FOUNDATIONAL AND NEARING THE FARM WORKER MOVEMENT HISTORY AS HAS OTHER SCHOLARSHIP MY WORK CUT TRIES TO GO BEYOND IT. TO TRIAL TO TELL WHAT KIND OF URBAN STORY OF. RACIAL SEGREGATION CIVIL RIGHTS AND LABOR RIGHTS THAT GO BEYOND THE ISSUES OF FARM LABOR. AND IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE DIVERSE MULTIRACIAL COALITION HISTORY ROOTED IT WITH THE COMMITTEE SERVICE ORGANIZATION OF THE NWC P. THE WAR ON POVERTY SCHOOL DESEGREGATION. TO TRY AGAIN TELL URBAN STORY AND WHAT A LOT OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT CONSIDERS A A RURAL COMMUNITY WRITES I TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT. AND YOU ASK YOU ALSO ASK QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND AND THIS IS HOW THIS NATION WE JUST POSTED ABOUT TWENTY OF FOLKS WHO CAME IN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH NPS IN DELANO. TO IT TO TOUR HISTORIC SITES AND THEN GO UP TO KEEN BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO DOEXACTLY WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT WITH WITH BANDS ARE REALLY PUSH THAT HARD. BUT IT REQUIRES THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS REQUIRES INTEGRATION IN SCHOOL CURRICULUM. AND THAT'S THAT'S SOME OF THE WORK THAT I'M DOING IT AGAIN THE MORE THAT WE CAN HIGHLIGHT THAT RICH LEGACY THE FARM WORKER MOVEMENT. IT BENEFITS OUR STUDENTS ARE THEY LOOKING TO POTENTIALLY. INCLUDE THE DELANO SITES IN THE BROADER NOT YES I ABSOLUTELY I THINK. FORTY ACRES. THE FILIPINO HALL THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE TWO THAT ARE GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION. AND AGAIN OF COURSE THE SITE UP IN IN THE KEEN BUT AGAIN IT WOULD BE A SORT OF I THINK I TRY PART RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOME OF THESE PHYSICAL SITES AT IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE CONTEST CAN TO STATION COMES INTO PLAY BUT WHICH SITES IN WHO'S GONNA CONTROL WHAT. BUT IN REALITY AGAIN IT'S THE THE RICH LEGACY OF THE AREA AND WE WNT TO MAKE THAT AGAIN AT A REGIONAL RESOURCE. SURE SURE SURE SURE ON THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO THE DATES YOU CHOSE FORTY SEVEN IN. A REALLY KIND OF LOOKING AT THE POST WAR NOT WORLD WAR TWO BUT REALLY THE POST DUST BOWL ON A TRANSFORMATION THAT HAPPENED IN TERMS OF RIGID RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. AND LOOKING AT THE THE RISE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. BEYOND THE FIELDS THROUGH THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. IN THIS SORT OF DECLINE IF YOU WILL OF MULTIRACIAL COALITION. NINE. NEW MUSIC HISTORY THERE TO. THE VISUALS OUTCOME THAT COMES INTO PLAY I I I USE SOME OF THE LYRICS OF MERLE HAGGARD ABOUT CODES IN MY OWN WORK TO KIND OF. HOW HE CAPTURED A CONSERVATIVE SENSIBILITY BUT THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE EVOLUTION OF OF BOTH ARTISTS AND WHAT THEY MEAN LOCALLY AND HALF THE INFUSION OF SPANISH MUSIC AS WELL SO? THERE'S A LOT OF MULTI CULTURALISM INDIVIDUAL SOUNDS I DO PLAY UPON THAT BUT THERE'S THERE'S OTHER FOLKS DOING THAT RESEARCH. NOT MYSELF AND ALSO A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR INCARCERATED FOLKS WE HAD THIS DEFINITELY ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS ALWAYS INTERESTING. A I WAS. THE ONE NIGHT WHEN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO. YOU KNOW OUR A A LITTLE HARDER EDGED ON ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ROSS A BIG MERLE HAGGARD FANS YEAH. YEAH YOU LISTEN TO THE LYRICS. ALRIGHT. THAT'S OKAY SO SO I'M VERY VERY COOL I MISS I MEAN CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE ABOUT THE YOUR BOOKS I MEAN I IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW PARTICIPATORY MUSEUM ART OF RELEVANCE IS THIS. ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU WERE DESCRIBING TRYING TO MAKE MUSEUMS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY MORE RELEVANT TO BROADER SOCIETAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS PEDAGOGICAL NEEDS ETCETERA YEAH SO GLOBALLY THERE ARE A LOT OF MUSEUMS AS WELL AS THEATERS LIBRARIES PARKS THAT ARE. WORKING ON HOW THEY CAN INVITE PEOPLE TO NOT JUST BE CONSUMERS BUT CO CREATORS OF THE PARTICIPATORY MUSEUM IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT HAPPENING IN MUSEUMS. THE ART OF RELEVANCE. WHICH CAME OUT JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I HAD TAKES A MUCH BROADER VIEW AND ACTUALLY LEADS WITH A STORY FROM ANZ IN OUR. ABOUT A MAN WHO CAME OUT THERE TOO HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY BIRTH RECORDS AND HE. HAD AN EXPERIENCE OF GOING AND ENGAGING WITH A GRADUATE STUDENT ARQUEBUS THERE WHO IS ABLE TO FIND WITHIN THE CAMP NEWSPAPER THE VERY FIRST. TIME HE'D EVER SEEN ANY RECOGNITION. THAT HE KIND OF SPUR STARTED TO EXIST IN PRINT AND JAM BUT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT STORY LEADS THE BOOK IS FRANKLY A LOT OF CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE DYING BECAUSE THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE ARCHIVE. ISN'T RELEVANT TO EVERYBODY AND I THINK AS WE'RE HEARING FROM ALL OF THIS TESTIMONY TODAY. IT IS RELEVANT BUT IT TAKES THESE BRIDGE BUILDING AN AMPLIFICATION PROJECTS TO CHANGE THE SENSE OF IT DUSTY BOOKS IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE TO THIS IS LIVING HISTORY THAT'S IT ONCE IN THE WAY WE CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER AND THE DECISIONS WE MAKE POLITICALLY. SO THE ART OF RELEVANCE IS REALLY ABOUT HOW CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS CAN MATTER MORE TO MORE PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THE COMMUNITIES AND THAT. ENVISION THAT FUTURE THAT WE WANT TO SEE. MISS I THIS OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WORK THE JOHNS DURING IT. WEDS. THE TO THE DUSTY BOOKS WITH THE WITH. CONTEMPT RELEVANCE AND SUCH SPECIAL WEB MUSEUM SO LIBRARIES ARE TAKING ON THIS KIND OF FASCINATING QUASI MUSEUM ROLE THAT LET YOU THERE'S A LOT OF EXHIBITS THAT. YOU KNOW AND AND I I A IS THAT A IS THAT A IS THAT A RELATIVELY NEW THING HISTORICALLY OR OR IS IT. YOU KNOW FLOWERING IN A IN A MUCH MORE PROFOUND WAY NOW IT. WELL I THINK YOU KNOW LIGHT LIBER LIBRARIES OF ALWAYS YOU KNOW TRY TO DO ALL THAT THEY COULD. TO CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHT COLLECTIONS AND AND. GIVE THE COMMUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO EXHIBIT ART AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK LIBRARIES. AND I THINK THE DIGITAL AGE IS CERTAINLY BROUGHT THIS ARE THINK OF THEMSELVES NOT JUST AS BOOK INSTITUTIONS OR EVEN EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS I THINK OF THE LOS ANGELES PUBLIC LIBRARY IS AN ARTS ORGANIZATION A HUMANITIES ORGANIZATION. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION SO. IT'S. AND THEY'RE SUCH OPPORTUNITY AND IT'S BECAUSE. WE SERVE ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE. THE POOREST IN OUR COMMUNITY THOSE WITH HOMES WITHOUT HOMES DOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED WEALTHY PEOPLE MAKE USE OF OUR LIBRARIES. AND. AND IT'S CONSTANTLY THINKING ABOUT WHO ARE WE NOT SERVING AND THE EXHIBITIONS THAT COME. IN BRANCH LIBRARIES IN CENTRAL LIBRARIES AND RURAL LIBRARIES SUBURBAN AND URBAN LIBRARIES. ARE ALL AN EFFORT TO GIVE VOICE TO TO PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO TO SERVICE OUR OWN COLLECTIONS I MEAN WE HAVE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE ONLY PUBLIC LIBRARY COLLECTION PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY OF. OF BEING STEWARDS OF THAT ARE KIND IS NOT JUST TO PROTECT THEM AND MAKE CERTAIN THERE ARE SAFE AND OKAY IN A LOCKED CASE SOMEWHERE BUT TO. TO ALLOW THEM TO TELL THEIR STORIES AND WHICH ARE THE STORIES OF ANGELENOS AND CALIFORNIANS. RE YOU RUN A AN EXTRAORDINARILY LARGE AND COMPLEX INSTITUTION YOU KNOW SEVENTY TWO BRANCHES A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE. IS THERE A PARTICULAR. BAD LOGISTICAL OR BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGED TO RUNNING INSTITUTION OF THAT SIZE AND COMPLEXITY THAT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO. POLICY MAKERS WELL IT'S SOME IT'S GOOD CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE DON'T RUN A COOKIE CUTTER LIBRARY SYSTEM. HOW HOW DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES AT WHAT THEY NEED FROM US IS DIFFERENT? BUT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE SERVICES MAY LOOK DIFFERENT ACROSS THE CITY. THAT THEY'RE EQUITABLE AND AND AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR STAKE HOLDERS BE ELECTED OFFICIALS OR. THE THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY AND AND OTHERS. AND AND THE RESIDENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND AND HAVE A GOOD FAITH THAT WERE EXPANDING THOSE RESOURCES EQUITABLY AND. AND AND TELLING THAT STORY REGULARLY AND CONSTANTLY IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN SPEAK THAT POWER SERVING PEOPLE IN WATSON PROCLAIM AND PACIFIC PALISADES IN EAST LA. ME TO WHAT EXTENT YOU GUYS NOW BEING ASKED TO TAKE ON. A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE CITY'S SOCIAL SERVICES. PARDON IN IN A BIG WAY AND AND IN MANY CASES WE'RE NOT WE'RE DOING IT BEFORE WE'RE BEING ASKED YEAH. AND. WE HAVE HIV TESTING IN OUR LIBRARIES I HAVE A CHILDREN'S DENTAL VAN A VISITING BRANCH LIBRARIES WE SERVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND LUNCHES LAST SUMMER. AND PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME A BURDEN AT ALL THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT WILL COME IN FOR THAT FREE LUNCH. THAT OUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH AS WELL AS VOLUNTEERS AND SPRING VOLUNTEERS IN OUR LIBRARY WHO LEARN ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MATERIALS IN ARMENIA AND AND TAGALOG AND SPANISH. THAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD OR THAT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP ON THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AT THE LIBRARY. AND. SO IT'S. IT'S SO IT'S A ROLE WE EMBRACE BUT YES THERE IS AN INCREASED DEMAND AND WORK WITH BECAUSE. WE REACH POPULATIONS AND WERE PHYSICALLY AND SO MANY NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CITY WHERE THOSE ISSUES EXIST WE MAKE A BEAUTIFUL PARTNER TO TO DO THAT WORK YEAH. I MEAN LOOK OBVIOUSLY THE THE. THE TERM I MEAN IT'S THE. WHAT IF THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S THER'S THIS EXTRA COST AND AND LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE ASSOCIATED WITH? WITH THESE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT I'M SURE THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE NO CLUE. THE STEP LIVELY SYSTEM IS TAKING ON TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS TRUE AND AND COORDINATING IT IS CERTAINLY CAN BE CHALLENGING. BUT WE RELY A GREAT DEAL ON COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND AND LOS ANGELES RESIDENTS PASSAGE OF MEASURE ELLEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN QUITE HONESTLY GIVES US THE ABILITY TO DO TO DO MUCH OF THIS WORK AND TO BE. INNOVATIVE IN TO TAKE RISKS THAT THAT SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE THANKFUL FOR IT AND EVERY TIME I'M IN FRONT OF AN ANGEL AND I SAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OKAY FINALLY TO TO YOU PROFESSOR SOFTWARE WEARS A GREAT SO IN IN. WHAT WAY IS THAT IF THE THE THE PLACE IN IN IN BAKERSFIELD WHERE WHERE? PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO REALLY DISCUSS THE. HISTORY OF THE AREA AND AND HAVE IT ON DISPLAY IT YOU KNOW WHAT WILL. WHAT WERE YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN YOU'RE BUT TURNS INTO A MUSEUM EXCEPT IF IT WERE SECONDLY? YOU KNOW I I THINK BIGGER SOLD AND REALLY ACROSS THE CENTER VALLEY THERE'S A LOT OF LIKE AGAIN LIKE SAID DIVIDED COMMUNITIES ISLAND COMMUNITIES WHETHER CERTAIN CONSTITUENTS THAT DO KNOW THEIR STORY THEY HAVE THESE KIND OF PUBLIC VENUES IN PUBLIC SPACES. BUT THEN THERE'S THESE OTHER COMMUNITIES THE KIND OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES THAT I LOOK AT MOSTLY THAT THAT. OFTEN DON'T INTERSECT WITH THE PUBLIC AND SO AGAIN THE FUNDING THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF THROUGH HUMANITIES IS TRYING TO AGAIN BRIDGE THOSE TWO WORLDS AND THE SITE THAT I'VE BEEN DOING IS THROUGH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHETHER IT'S. INVITING AT PUBLIC TALKS IN SPANISH AT THE DELANO CAMPUS OR IS GETTING CC BIGGER SCHOOL FACULTY TO GO TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHERE TO ME THE MAGIC HAPPENS WHEN YOU AGAIN CAN CONNECT THE. TRADITIONAL RESOURCES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDS ARE SPACES SO STORIES WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE PERIPHERY FOR FOR SO LONG. WE SAY THEY DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE F. W. ACTUALLY ON HAVE A BIGGER FOR COLLEGE HAD A CALLING OF CAMPUS IT WAS ACTUALLY FOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE FARM WORKER MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE ATTENTION. THE NEGATIVE ATTENTION PRIMARILY IT WAS COMING TO DELANO SOME OF THE THE FARMERS AND THAT THEY CAN COMMUNICATE ALL JUST GOT TOGETHER TO BUILD A CAMPUS THERE TO EDUCATE THE CHILDREN. A FARM WORKER SINCE THERE IS AGAIN A STRONG KIND OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FARMER CAN MOVE AND EDUCATION. AND AND YOU'RE YOU GUYS ARE YOU'RE PART OF THE KEY BECAUSE SYSTEMS THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AND AND IN THE DISTRICT INCLUDES TELLING OF GEOGRAPHICALLY YEAH ACTUALLY CLOSER CLOSER COLLEGE UP IN THE HIGH DESERT. PORTABLE COLLEGE AND IN BIGGER COLLEGE WHICH HAS A MAIN CAMPUS AND BIGGEST ON THE CAMPUS AND DELANO AND WE JUST PASSED A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BOND TO EXPAND OUR OUR CAMPUS IN THE SOUTH KERN. ARE YOU ALSO HAVE THE LARGEST PRISON EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THE COMMITTEE COUCHES ARE. AND WE WERE NOT TOO GRAPHIC RICH HE ABSOLUTELY YEAH. INTERESTING OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. REFERS TO. ALRIGHT SO. YOU KNOW THE NEXT PANEL OF THE QUESTION PERHAPS HAS ALREADY BEEN ANSWERED STATED HUMANITIES DO THEY MATTER. BUT WE HAVE SOME REALLY FANTASTIC PEOPLE TO REFLECT ON. SOME OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY AND THAT THAT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION KATRINA WOULD WORTH USE. THIS YEAR PRINCIPAL RESEARCHERS SR I EDUCATION. AND THEN YOU HAVE BARHAM. THIS COMMUNITY AND GAZE RECORDING OR TOUGHER HUMANITIES AND WE ALSO HAVE CHILI FRIES. OF COURSE IS OUR PRESIDENT CEO OF CAL FOR HUMANITIES AND WE WELCOME. THE THREE OF YOU TO. TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY WILL START WITH THEM MIX WELL WITH. THANK. YOU. THIS IS SOMEONE CONTROLLING THE POWER POINT YEAH FROM AFAR OKAY. BUT I CAN JUST START OFF I'M SO SO I WORK AT A STAR I INTERNATIONAL IN THE BAY AREA WHERE A NONPROFIT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. AND WE WERE COMMISSIONED BY CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES TO DO A STUDY LOOKING AT THAT ACCESS STUDENT ACCESS TO IT AND HUMANITIES COURSE WORK IN THE PUBLIC CABLE SYSTEM. SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR STUDENT ENROLLMENT. AND THEN. COURSE AT TO LOOK AT WHAT COURSES WERE OFFERED IN AND I'M CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND THEN WHAT. COURSES STUDENTS ENROLLED IN AND WE MERGE THAT DATA WITH SOME DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON SCHOOLS SO THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT SCHOOL POVERTY RATES IN PARTICULAR. SO WITH THE PURPOSE OF UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THEIR EQUITY ISSUES IN PARTICULAR RELATING TO ACCESS TO HUMANITIES COURSE WORK. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS A FAIRLY OBVIOUS SLOT. FINDING BUT THAT THAT'S THAT CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER MORE VARIETY OF HUMANITIES COURSES THAN THE SMALLEST HIGH SCHOOLS SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS WE DIVIDED THE SCHOOLS INTO. INTO COURT TRIALS BY SIZE SO THE LITTLEST SCHOOLS ARE IN BLUE AND THE LARGEST CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS ARE IN YELLOW. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER FOR MORE. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS COURSES THAN THE SMALLEST HIGH SCHOOL THEN AND THAT'S NOT SURPRISING IS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW WHEN WE DEBATE SCHOOL SIZE AND THAT. YOU CAN HAVE MORE VARIETY OF COURSE WORK BUT IT IS A QUESTION THAT WE GOT SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT IN FRONT THAT. YES IN FACT THERE'S MORE VARIETY IN THEM THOUGH THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK THE QUALITY AND CALIBER NO NO NO NO IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S JUST MORE VARIETY OF COURSE. OFFERINGS YET. SO HERE IS REALLY THE MAIN FINDING WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING SO HUMANITIES COURSES INCLUDE ENGLISH HISTORY FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND THEN THE STUDY AND THEORY OF THE ART SO WE INCLUDED MUSIC THEORY ART HISTORY COURSES LIKE THAT. AND BECAUSE ALL STUDENTS TAKE ENGLISH IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL STUDENTS TAKE HISTORY IN HIGH SCHOOL WE DECIDED TO LOOK AT ADVANCED PARTICIPATION ADVANCED COURSES AND AN ADVANCED COURSE OFFERINGS. AND SO WHAT THIS GRAPH TELLS US IS THAT SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN THAT THAT. LOWEST POVERTY QUARTILE SO THE BLUE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO OFFER PARTICULAR. ADVANCED COURSES LIKE AP ENGLISH AP US HISTORY AND THIS IS TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT ID COURSES AND IT'S TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT FOREIGN LANGUAGE COURSES THAT ARE ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. SO YOU CAN SEE THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES THE ONE EXCEPTION IS EIGHTY LANGUAGE M. EIGHTY SPANISH LANGUAGE AND THAT'S THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S IT OFFERED ACROSS THAT POVERTY LEVELS ARE SCHOOLS. BUT IN TERMS OF ALL THE OTHER SUBJECTS IF YOU INTEND TO SCHOOLS SERVING MORE AFFLUENT COMMUNITY YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED COURSEWORK IN HUMANITY'S MOST DRAMATIC. GOD. DISPARITIES IN FRENCH YES YES YEAH THE FOREIGN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN SPANISH ARE RARELY OFFERED AT THAT MANY OF OUR HIGHEST POVERTY SCHOOLS. I'M THIS FINDING TURNED OUR ATTENTION TO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND IT GOES IT'S ALSO A FOREIGN LANGUAGE RELATED FINDING SO CALIFORNIA MIDDLE SCHOOLS THAT ARE SERVING HIGH POVERTY COMMUNITIES ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO OFFER FOREIGN LANGUAGE SO YOU'LL SEE. I THINK THAT NUMBER IS TWENTY EIGHT. THAT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS THE AT THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MIDDLE SCHOOLS THAT SERVE OUR. HIGHEST POVERTY COMMUNITIES EVEN OFFER FOREIGN LANGUAGE VERSUS STUDENTS THAT ARE IN ARE MORE AFFLUENT SCHOOL SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING FOREIGN LANGUAGE COURSES. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL SO THAT WAS ANOTHER BIG. GAP AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IN OUR HIGH POVERTY COMMUNITIES THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THOSE KINDS OF CORPORATE COURSE OFFERINGS AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL. HIGH SCHOOLS OF COURSE ARE REQUIRED OFTEN LANGUAGE LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF A THIRTY REQUIREMENTS. SO THIS GRAPH IS FOCUSED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND OF COURSE ONLY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS. BEAT AND AN ENROLLMENT IN IT IN ADVANCED COURSES IN PARTICULAR SO WHAT YOU CAN SEE ALTHOUGH THE NUMBERS ARE LOW ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS THAT. THAT ENROLL IN AN ADVANCED COURSES YOU CAN STILL SEE SIGNIFICANT GAPS YOU KNOW TWENTY PERCENT NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OF STUDENTS IN. HI PART IN AND LOW POVERTY MORE AFFLUENT HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENROLLED IN AN ADVANCED HISTORY OR SOCIAL SCIENCE COURSE VERSUS ONLY TEN PERCENT AND OUR HIGHER PROPERT COMMUNITY. YOU SEE THE SAME GAP IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE. AND YOU SEE SOMEONE OF A GAP IN ENGLISH ELEVEN PERCENT VERSUS EIGHT PERCENT. AND THEN FINALLY WE LOOKED AT GENDER ISSUES IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION AND ADVANCED HUMANITIES COURSE AND WE SEE THAT THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS THAT ARE ENROLLED IN ADVANCE HUMANITIES. COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL OUR GIRLS YOUNG WOMEN SO IT'S ABOUT SIXTY FORTY IN TERMS OF THAT PARTICIPATION IN THESE ADVANCED HUMANITIES COURSES. SO I IMAGINE IF WE HAD A SLIDE LOOKING AT STEM COURSES IT MIGHT LOOK IT MIGHT LOOK GOOD. DIFFERENT. WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT BUT. WE WERE SOMEWHAT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT GENDER DISPARITY THERE. AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE. NOW I'M NOT I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE AT WHERE YOU THAT'S A PRICEY DINNERS FOR. WELL I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T STUDIED GENDER ISSUES IN EDUCATION PERSONALLY THAT MUCH WE DO A LOT OF OUR COOKING IN THE POVERTY ISSUE SO. NOW THINKING ABOUT IT I GUESS IT'S NOT TOO SURPRISING BUT. I DO WONDER IF WE WOULD SEE THE SAME KIND OF DIFFERENCE IF ELECTED STEM COURSES. SLIP AWAY HAS A. YEAH I DON'T KNOW. OKAY THANK YOU FIGURE MATURING VERY AS FACT BUT BUT. BUT DISTURBING I TERMS OF THE. THE THE SUCH ECONOMIC DISPARITY ASPECTS OF THIS. OKAY ONE NEXT YEAR FROM MISTER BAHRAM. BORROW A VERY WELCOME. SAID THANK YOU SO MUCH ANGOLA. ANTEATERS YEAH YEAH. SIDES A. SO MY NAME IS A HUMBLE AROUND WHEN THEY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COORDINATOR AT CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES AND ALSO THE CURATOR FOR IN THE ART OF STORYTELLING WHICH IS. OUR ROTATING ART EXHIBIT IN OUR OAKLAND HEADQUARTERS. OUR EXHIBITS HIGHLIGHT CALIFORNIA ARTISTS TO BOLDLY EXPLORED THEMES THAT SPARK CURIOSITY. AND THE SEEMINGLY UNFAMILIAR AND ENCOURAGE EMPATHY BY ACTING AS A MATTER OF OUR OWN IDENTITIES. WE VALUE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO ART EDUCATION OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. AND SEEK TO ENHANCE THE VIEWER'S EXPERIENCE BY NURTURING COMMUNITY DIALOGUE WITH THE ARTISTS HISTORICAL EXPERTS AND CULTURE BEARS THAT FREE PUBLIC FEELINGS. WE'VE BROUGHT THE SALINAS VALLEY TO THE BAY AREA WITH RECENTLY AND EARTH THIRTY FIVE MILLIMETER PHOTOS OF CESAR CHAVEZ AND THE UNITED FARM WORKER MEMBERS. THESE PHOTOS OF THE LESSER KNOWN BUT HISTORICALLY CRUCIAL MARCH IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WERE TAKEN BY ME ME PLUMB. WITH HISTORICAL CONTEXT PROVIDED BY MARION PAUL WHO YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER. WE'VE OPENED UP OUR SPACE TO RICHMOND BASED TEENS FROM THE RICE CENTER TO SHARE THEIR OFTEN IGNORED BUT INCREDIBLY COMPELLING STORIES. EXPRESS TO THEIR ART AND POETRY. WE'VE ADORN OUR WALLS WITH VIBRANT QUILTS MADE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN QUILT GUILD OF OAKLAND'S. PLEASE USE THE TRADITION OF QUILTING TO PRESERVE THE PRIDE. HISTORY AND HARDSHIPS IN DORT OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AND WE'VE AMPLIFIED THE VOICES OF THE INMATES AT LANCASTER PRISON WHO ARE CURRENTLY SERVING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCES BY DISPLAYING THEIR ARTWORK. HAND WRITTEN AUTOBIOGRAPHIES AND LARGER THAN LIFE SIX FOOT TALL LARGER THAN LIFE PHOTOS THAT'S THE THE PRESENT WE DESERVE IT RIGHT YES. I'M SO WE DISPAY THOSE AND ACTUALLY THE EXHIBIT IS LAUNCHING IN OUR OAKLAND OFFICE NOT IN LA TOMORROW. SO YOU'RE OAKLAND OFFICE PROVIDES A CAN A CURATORIAL SPACE AS WELL YES AND SOMETHING TAT WE STARTED BACK IN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. I'M DOWNTOWN OAKLAND YES. OLD OAKLAND BUT YES DOWNTOWN GREAT. AND SO EACH OF THESE EXHIBITS SOME OF THEM ARE EXHIBITS THAT COME DRESSED THE PROJECTS THAT WE FIND IT FOR EXAMPLE THE MIMI PALM PHOTOS AND DEMOCRACY IN THE FEELS DOCTOR ROY IS. PROJECT RIGHT AND CAGE BUT SUMMER OR FROM ARTISTS THAT AREN'T FUNDED PREVIOUSLY BY US LIKE THE RICE CENTER. OR EVEN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN QUILT GUILD OF PLANS AND THEN% YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE ARTIST ON THE COVER OF OUR PROGRAM TODAY FIVE YARD FREE GAS. ON WHO'S ALSO FEATURED AS A PART OF EXHIBIT SO IT'S FAIRLY NEW. AND OUR HOPE IS TO BRING. NEW PEOPLE NEW AUDIENCES TO OUR SPACE TO LEARN ABOUT US AND FOR US TO LEARN ABOUT. THEM. SO IN MY CONCLUSION I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE ART OF STORYTELLING IS A TRUE MARRIAGE OF THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES. IT PROVIDES ARTISTS WITH A VALUE TO REACH AND EDUCATE NEW AUDIENCES WHILE GIVING HOW FRAIL HUMANITY IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONVENE MEMBERS OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE MONEY'S OFFER CULTURAL CONTACTS HISTORY AND LITERATURE. THAT ENHANCE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE ARTS AND BUILD BRIDGES OF UNDERSTANDING ACROSS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOU SO MUCH PRESERVE. AND I SUPPOSE MS FRIES YOUR BOSSES AND YES SHE IS OUR MASS IN FEARLESS LEADER AREN'T FEARLESS LEADER. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'M REALLY PROUD PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES. AND I AM PLAYING THE GOOD CABOOSE IN TODAY'S HUMANITIES TRAIN WEARING RED. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND IS THE YOUNGEST OF FIVE KIDS MY SIBLINGS WOULD SAY THAT'S THE ROLE THAT I WAS BORN TO PLAY. AND EVERY GOOD CABOOSE KNOWS THAT WHEN THE OTHER TRAIN CARS AND I'M JUST GONNA KEEP USING THIS A ANALOGY WHEN THE TRAIN CAR LOOK TRAIN CARS DO THE HEAVY LIFTING YOU JUST LET THEM DO THE HEAVY LIFTING I THINK THEY'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB TODAY. SHARING THE IMPACT OF THE HUMANITIES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY. WHAT WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL REMEMBER FROM TODAY'S HEARING? WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT THE HUMANITIES ARE ALIVE AND WELL IN CALIFORNIA. WE HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT THERE'S AN ECOSYSTEM OF ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE WORKING TO FOSTER THEM AND MAKE THEM ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE IN CALIFORNIA MANATEES IS SO PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT ECOSYSTEM. AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION OF FORTY THREE YEARS OLD WE'RE NOT A STATE AGENCY BUT WE GET A PARTNER WITH STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE ARTS COUNCIL AND THE STATE LIBRARY. AND WE HOPE THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA STRONG NOT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND CULTURAL ASSETS THAT BLOOM THERE. WE KNOW THAT THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES ARE AT THE CORE AND THAT THEY ALWAYS NEED MORE SUPPORT. I'D LIKE TO FINISH WITH A SHORT VIDEO ABOUT CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES NARRATED BY THE FORMER U. S. POET LAUREATE JUAN FELIPE THEY HAD AT A. HE WAS ALSO CALIFORNIA MANATEES BOARD MEMBER BACK IN THE DAY. AS YOU WATCH INVITE YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOUR CALIFORNIA STORY. THE HUMANITIES. TO ME ART ATTEMPT TO ANSWER TO DEAL WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN LIFE. CALIFORNIA A STATE OF ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. WITH MILLIONS OF STORIES TO SHARE. THE STATE OF WRITERS FILMMAKERS STORYTELLERS AN ARTIST. A STATE OF INNOVATORS AND THINKERS A STATE OF OPEN MINE. FOR OVER FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES HAS HELPED GIVE VOICE TO VOICE IS SELDOM HEARD THROUGH GRANTS AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS THAT REACH INTO EVERY CORNER OF OUR STATE. WE HELP TELL THE STORIES OF CALIFORNIA YOUR SORY. HUMANITIES ARE CENTRAL TO WHO WE ARE THEY ENLIGHTEN INSPIRE EDUCATE PROVOKE THOUGHT AND HELP US EXCHANGE IDEAS. THEY EXPAND OUT EMPATHY BY ENCOURAGING US TO EXPRESS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES THEY HELPED MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY STRONGER. THE HUMANITIES TEACH CRITICAL THINKING POWER OF CURIOSITY AND THE JOY OF DISCOVERY THAT HELP US UNDERSTAND AND VALUE WHAT WE HAVE IN COMMON RATHER THAN WHAT DIVIDES US. CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES SUPPORTS THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE THROUGH DOCUMENTARY FILM ORAL HISTORIES PERFORMANCES EXHIBITS POGRAMS IN LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS AND MUCH MORE. CONNECT PEOPLE TO IDEAS INTO EACH OTHER AND HELP OPEN NEW WORLDS OF LEARNING THAT REFLECT OUR DIVERSE CULTURES TRADITIONS AND HISTORY. TO MANY THIS MATTER BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY. WAY. THAT HUMANITY HAS UNDERSTOOD THE LIFE. IT IS THE SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING AT CALIFORNIA HUMANITIES WE WORK TO AMPLIFY THE VOICES THAT HELP US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER TO BUILD A BETTER. CALIFORNIA. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. AND THAT IMPORTANT. THOUGHTS AND IDEAS ARE NEVER COMPLETE THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR MORE. THE NEXT ONE IS UP TO YOU. WHAT IS YOUR CALIFORNIA STORY? WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US AT CAL HOME. FOR. THAT YOU SHOULD TELL US WHO THE NARRATOR WAS ONE FOR THE BETA. US POET LAUREATE WHO CAME TO THE FORE AND SENATE. WELL THANK YOU I. REALLY CAN'T CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT. ABOUT ABOUT HOW THE CASE WAS MADE UP COULD COULD YOU JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE THE STRUCTURES OF CALIFORNIA AMENITIES AND IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE ARTS COUNCIL. I'VE WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT. YOU PLAY HIS ACCORDING ROLE TEAMS AND AND RECIPIENT OF ANY AGE GRANTS BUT. BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AND AND TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP YEAH ABSOLUTELY WHEN WE'RE A PRIVATE NONPROFIT SO WE ARE NOT AND NEVER HAVE BEEN A STATE AGENCY. AND BACK IN THE FORTY THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE STATE ARTS COUNCILS IN THE STATE HUMANITIES COUNCILS WERE BEING CREATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE WAS A DECISION MADE. THAT THE ARTS COUNCILS WOULD BE STATE AGENCIES AND THAT THE HUMANITIES COUNCILS WILL BE NONPROFIT THIS DECISION WAS MADE AT WHAT LEVEL OF THIS IS MADE AT THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. WINDS AND SO IT'S IT'S THE SAME ACROSS IN EVERY STATE WHY WHY IT WELL THERE'S A REALLY LONG PAPER ABOUT THAT THAT I CAN SEND TOYOU. AND AND TO BE HONEST IT'S IT'S A I THINK AN INTERESTING CHECKS AND BALANCES. WITH THE STATE ARTS COUNCIL FROM STATE HUMANITIES COUNCILS WE DO HAVE GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEES TO OUR BOARD. UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR BOARD IS MADE UP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE REST. OF THEM A NORMAL NON PROFIT NOMINATION PROCESS YOU KNOW AND SO WE WE WE DON'T RECEIVE STATE FUNDING BUT WE DO PARTNER WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. WE'VE DONE PRO PUBLIC PROGRAMS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCILS WE HAVE. DONE SOME FUNDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE STATE LIBRARY WERE WORKING WITH UNIVERSITIES AND. MUNITY COLLEGES ON YOUTH PROGRAMS. AND WE BELONG TO SOMETHING CALLED THE CULTURAL CABINET WHICH IS. ALL OF THE THE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THE CULTURE AND HERITAGE AND WERE ONE OF THE FEW NON PROFIT MEMBERS ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA STORE CALLED SOCIETY. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT YOU REALLY SHOULD WITHIN EACH. SO THE AGE IS IS OUR PRIMARY THUNDER WHEN YOU JUST SAY THAT UP FRONT AND. WE WE ARE WHAT IS CALLED ONE OF THEIR STATE PARTNERS SO THEY'RE FIFTY SIXTY COUNCILS. AROUND THE COUNTRY THEY INCLUDE SOME OF THE THE ISLAND THAT SECTOR AND WE ALL RECEIVE FUNDING ACCORDING TO A FORMULA FROM THE ANY AGE. AND WE IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS IN OUR OWN STATE IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO BUT WE REPORT TO THE ANY AGE AND WE LOOK FOR WAYS OF COLLABORATING WITH THEM. AND WHETHER OUR THEIR STATE COMMUNITY AT COUNCIL PARTNERS. AND. HOW IS THAT? HOW IS IT REALLY SHOULD EVOLVE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND? I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO THE LAST THREE AND A HALF. YEAH I I WOULD THINK WAS OUR BIG DESERT. I HAVE THINGS BEEN KIND OF PRETTY STEADY WITH THE CHANGING MINISTRATION ON I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THE PRESENCE TRY TO. ZERO OUT THE BUDGETING BUT TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT THE ORGANIZATION IS REALLY SHIP WITH. WITH AN INSTANCE LIKE YOURS HAS THAT BEEN PRETTY STEADY FROM BEFORE THE. THE THE CHANGEOVER TO NOW YEN IN JUST TO PUT SOME HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS WELL THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. OVERTIME QUESTIONS OF WHETHER TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE CULTURAL AGENCIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED. AND SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALWAYS PREPARED FOR WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT MAYBE IT WILL HAPPEN. AND WHAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN PROUD OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NATIONAL ANTHEM FOR THE HUMANITIES WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE. A PUBLIC PRIVATE APPROACH TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN THE SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVE AND WE ARE ARE. VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF SUCH A LARGE COALITION. I THINK THERE'S A CRITICAL MASS OF HUMANITY'S WORK THAT'S BEEN DOING BUT HAPPENING AT THE THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT SOME. FEDERAL MONEY COMES TO GRANTEES FROM THE ANY H. DIRECTLY IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS REALLY WONDERFUL IT'S IT'S MULTIPLE WAYS OF SUPPORTING HUMANITIES IN CALIFORNIA. GRAHAM. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTITION OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU SEE WITH STATE AGENCIES WHAT. EXISTS CURRENTLY AND WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF RUSSIA'S CROW. WE ARE WE LOVE SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH THE OTHER AT THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES THE CULTURAL AGENCIES BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE A COMMON GOAL TO REALLY PRESERVE AND HELP. OUR OUR COMMUNITIES THRIVE AND WE ALSO WANT TO PARTNER WITH WITH EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES WE DO THAT IN A. IN A. IN MORE INFORMAL WAY AND WE'D LIKE TO BE MUCH MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT THAT WHICH IS WHY WE'VE WORKED WITH KATIE AND AND ARE LOOKING AT WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING AND NOT HAPPENING AT THE EDUCATION LEVEL WITH THE WITH THE HUMANITIES. IS THERE A PARTICULAR. PARTNERSHIP THE YOU HAVE IT THAT. AND EXEMPLIFIES THAT SPIRIT I MEAN IT WITH WITH THAT WITH IT WITH ANOTHER STATE AGENCY. SOME PROJECT OR YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT. THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL HAS BEEN CRITICAL. OF NOT ONLY HOW WE SHARE. THAT IS THAT THE IDEA THAT THE ARTS REALLY EXPRESS THE HUMANITIES RIGHT SO WE REALLY ARE HAND IN GLOVE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THEM BUT ALSO JUST IN RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF ARTS EDUCATION HUMANITIES EDUCATION I'LL JUST KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT I THINK THE CHILDREN OUR FUTURE. AND I THINK THE THE THE THE ARTS COUNCIL REALLY SHARES THAT BELIEF WITH US. YEAH. SOME OF US LIKE TO MAKE A SONG ABOUT WELL YOU KNOW I'VE GOT A TUNE IN MY HEAD SOMEHOW. WELL I YOU KNOW AND I WOULD JUST MENTION A LEARNER MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK INTO. CHANGING THE NAME OF THE COMMITTEE THAT OKAY ARTS AND HUMANITIES SELLABLE. AND I MIGHT BE IN THE CITY FOR I VOTE YES SOME NOT TO WRITE ABOUT. HI. SO DID YOU DID YOU DO YOU KNOW. HOW YOUR DATA COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY? I DON'T I TRY AND WE AREN'T WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT NATIONAL COMPARISON I MEAN THOSE KINDS EQUITY ISSUES ARE TYPICAL UNFORTUNATELY HAS THE COUNTRY SO. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT THEY WOULD BE SIMILAR. CAR AND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU SPENDING TIME LOOKING AT AND MAYBE. ANY OF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THIS THE EXTENT TO WHICH. THERE SOME. REALLY COULD BEST PRACTICES IN TERMS OF COORDINATION BETWEEN HUMANITIES INSTITUTIONS AND. SCHOOLS THAT WE OUGHT TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO TRY TO SCALE. I THINK THERE ARE THINGS LIKE I THINK OF THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS OUT REACH TO THE K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH A SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS. THERE ARE CERTAINLY INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT DO OUR RESEARCH IN SCHOOLS. URGENTLY IF YOU CAN THINK OF OTHER. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. AND IT'S CERTAINLY WRITTEN IN THE STATE POLICY THAT ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A HUMANITIES EDUCATION. SO I THINK THAT THE THE EXEMPLARS WITH THE SORT OF. ONE OFF LOCAL PARTITIONS MORE SO AND THEN THOSE SUPPORTED BY THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND. YEAH PROGRAMS YEAH CREDIT MATTER PROJECTS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE THREE OF YOU AND AND. AND THINKS OBVIOUSLY HAD SO MUCH OF WHAT WAS ON DISPLAY HERE TODAY IS AS. A RESULT OF YOUR. HARD WORK IDENTIFYING WHERE THE PROJECTS AND THEN GETTING THE FUNDING THEY NEED AND GIVEN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT A GREAT DEAL AND. AND ALSO I JUST WANNA THINK JULIE AND AND. HOW EVERYONE FROM CALIFORNIA MATTERS FOR COORDINATING WITH ARE FANTASTIC INSULT AND I LEARNED PEYSER MEANS AND YES OBVIOUSLY SELF ASSEMBLY SIDE TO? WORK REALLY HARD TO PULL THIS HIS HEARING TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HIGHLIGHTING THESE KIND OF THESE STORIES AND-FORTUNE EVERYTHING IS. BEING RECORDED AND LIVE STREAM AND IT IS A TOUGH THEY HAVEN'T I'VE BEEN TRYING TO. GET MY COLLEAGUES TO COME DOWN ADD TO TO GET A LITTLE TASTE OF ALL THIS OUT BUT WE GOT THE RULES COMMITTEE MEETING BUDGETS AND MEETING AND.

I'M AN URBAN PLANNER AT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND I WORK EXCLUSIVELY IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. THE HUMANITIES ARE CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE I SERVE. THE HUMANITIES TEACHERS TO REFLECT. TWO QUESTION. TO DEBATE. TO CONFRONT. AND TO ENJOY OUR HUMAN CONDITION AND ALL ITS COMPLEXITIES. HUMANITIES EDUCATION EMPOWERS OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO INTERROGATE AND RESIST THE OPPRESSIVE POWER STRUCTURES THAT ARE PART OF DAILY LIFE. IN SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. YOUR CONSTITUENTS INCLUDE MANY CALIFORNIANS INCARCERATED. IN OUR STATES PRISONS. FAR TOO MANY FOLKS OF THE WORKING CLASS. AND FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR. THERE ARE NEIGHBORS. THERE ARE FRIENDS. AND THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS. INCARCERATION DOES NOT ARREST THE HUMAN NEED TO READ. TO WRITE. TO SPEAK. WORDS ON CAGED OFFERS THEM A SPACE TO ENGAGE IN CRITICAL DIALOGUE AND REFLECTION. THAT ENRICHES THE TIME SPENT BEHIND BARS. AND PREPARES SOME FOR REINTEGRATION INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IN SOUTH CENTRAL. WORDS ON CAGE REMINDS US THAT THE TWO. OUR HUMAN.
