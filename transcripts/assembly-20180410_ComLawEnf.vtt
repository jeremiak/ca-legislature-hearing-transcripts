RIVERSIDE COUNTIES AND AND

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:10.020 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN SHARING OUR

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:17.561 region:rollup2
STRIDES.

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:18.729 region:rollup2
AND SO I. I ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:20.965 region:rollup2
WAS THINKING WHEN I WAS DOING

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:23.167 region:rollup2
THAT I TRAIN WITH MY WIFE ERIN

00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:24.802 region:rollup2
WHO'S. BASICALLY OUT OF IRAN

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:25.936 region:rollup2
SHE'S THE BRAINS ON THE

00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:26.837 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL GUY.

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:28.105 region:rollup2
SHE CAN SHE COMES UP WITH ALL

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:30.307 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCTS

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:32.143 region:rollup2
I AND IT MAKES ALL THE CONTACTS

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:33.511 region:rollup2
AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND STUFF LIKE

00:48:32.143 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
THAT. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:48:33.511 --> 00:48:37.581 region:rollup2
OF THE SIEGE P. I WAS THINKING.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.583 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING SO

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:41.252 region:rollup2
MANY THINGS ABOUT. EACH PERSON

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:43.053 region:rollup2
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IS DIFFERENT

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:44.588 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WORKS WITH ONE. WON'T

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:46.757 region:rollup2
WORK ON ANOTHER ONE MIGHT WORK

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:48.058 region:rollup2
WITH ANOTHER. AND YOU KNOW SO

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.894 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING YOU DO THIS AND

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:51.629 region:rollup2
THIS AND THIS EXCEPT YOU KNOW IT

00:48:49.894 --> 00:48:53.764 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. AND SO WHAT

00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:55.599 region:rollup2
WOULD I DO FOR THAT AND I WAS

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:57.168 region:rollup2
THINKING. AND IF I WERE AN

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:59.570 region:rollup2
OFFICER AND I WOULD GET

00:48:57.168 --> 00:49:01.205 region:rollup2
PERMISSION IT TO GOING UNIFORM

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:02.239 region:rollup2
TO PLACES WHERE THERE ARE SPENT

00:49:01.205 --> 00:49:04.975 region:rollup2
BEFORE SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:07.745 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND GROUP HOMES SPECIAL

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:09.713 region:rollup2
OLYMPICS AYE THERAPY SESSIONS SO

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:11.782 region:rollup2
THAT I COULD SEE HOW PEOPLE THAT

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:13.584 region:rollup2
ARE AROUND PROVIDERS INTERACT

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:15.286 region:rollup2
WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:17.288 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IF I SEE SOMEONE IN

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.756 region:rollup2
THE STREET I I MIGHT THINK WELL

00:49:17.288 --> 00:49:20.024 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS GUY SAW

00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:22.326 region:rollup2
THAT TIME IN THEIR THERAPIST

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:24.228 region:rollup2
SAID. IN A BRIEF.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.830 region:rollup2
BREED WITH ME YOU KNOW READ MY

00:49:24.228 --> 00:49:26.897 region:rollup2
LIPS OR OR YOU KNOW IS IT

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:29.133 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:30.301 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. AND

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:32.470 region:rollup2
LAID OUT AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE

00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:33.737 region:rollup2
SOME TOOLS AND ALSO THE PEOPLE

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.706 region:rollup2
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IF THEY WERE

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:37.608 region:rollup2
USED TO SEEING. OUR OFFICERS IN

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:39.643 region:rollup2
UNIFORM COME TO THEIR SCHOOLS IN

00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:41.712 region:rollup2
THE PLACES WHERE THEY LIVE.

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:43.514 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE MISSING DATE MIGHT

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:45.149 region:rollup2
TEND TO GO TO A POLICEMAN IF

00:49:43.514 --> 00:49:45.616 region:rollup2
THEY SEE IF THEY'RE LOST I'M

00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:47.218 region:rollup2

00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.818 region:rollup2
POLICEMAN.

00:49:47.218 --> 00:49:49.086 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY SEE A POLICEMAN

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.521 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD THINK WOW THIS IS A

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:52.790 region:rollup2
FRIEND THIS IS SOMEBODY I CAN

00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:54.992 region:rollup2
TRUST BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:58.362 region:rollup2
AND TOO MANY TIMES IS THAT.

00:49:54.992 --> 00:50:00.030 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THINK

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:01.632 region:rollup2
THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS A

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.400 region:rollup2
STRANGER BECAUSE MAYBE THEY

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.302 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T MET. MANY POLICE

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.271 region:rollup2
OFFICERS AND SO WHEN THE AND

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.605 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:08.138 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY LAST

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.774 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD BE HIDING.

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:12.643 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THEY ON AND THEIR

CARS.

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:12.423 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU WANDER OFF AND AND

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:14.091 region:rollup2
IF UNSUPERVISED

00:53:12.423 --> 00:53:15.959 region:rollup2
SO IT HAS HAPPENED.

00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:17.327 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:19.329 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S JUST A PART OF WHO

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:21.899 region:rollup2
MANUAL IS.

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:24.001 region:rollup2
HE LOVES MUSIC I ESPECIALLY NOR

00:53:21.899 --> 00:53:25.536 region:rollup2
JONES AND BEETHOVEN. AND HE

00:53:24.001 --> 00:53:26.904 region:rollup2
LOVES HIS TABLET

00:53:25.536 --> 00:53:28.038 region:rollup2
HE LIKES TO WATCH. DOOR THE

00:53:26.904 --> 00:53:30.841 region:rollup2
EXPLORER.

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:33.177 region:rollup2
BLUE'S CLUES DISNEY MOVIES.

00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:35.112 region:rollup2
AND HE'S VERY CHILDLIKE.

00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:36.814 region:rollup2
BUT HE LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE

00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:38.115 region:rollup2
STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN.

00:53:36.814 --> 00:53:39.917 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS

00:53:38.115 --> 00:53:42.920 region:rollup2
COMBINATION UNFORTUNATELY.

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:45.122 region:rollup2
FOR HIM LIKE ALL HUMANS.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.457 region:rollup2
WHO WE REACTS WITH A FIGHT OR

00:53:45.122 --> 00:53:48.258 region:rollup2
FLIGHT INSTINCT?

00:53:46.457 --> 00:53:49.626 region:rollup2

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:51.061 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FILLED IF YOU FEEL

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:52.896 region:rollup2
FRIGHTENED OR ENDANGERING YOU

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:55.599 region:rollup2
ARE UNKNOWN TO WHAT'S COMING

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:57.267 region:rollup2
ACTUAL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:59.670 region:rollup2
HAVE ALWAYS WORRIED.

00:53:57.267 --> 00:54:00.971 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW LONG FOR SENATE AND

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.240 region:rollup2
OFFICERS ARE ANY FIRST RESPONDER

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:04.508 region:rollup2
FOR THAT MUCH WOULD REACT TO HIM

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.376 region:rollup2
AND HIS BEHAVIORS.

00:54:04.508 --> 00:54:08.212 region:rollup2
AND. THERE ARE SOME VERY REAL

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:09.480 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS OF HOW THAT COULD

00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:10.481 region:rollup2
HAPPEN HE COULD WANDER FROM HIS

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.349 region:rollup2
DAY GREW.

00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:13.951 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO FEEL THREATENED

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:15.686 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HIS SIZE AND HIS

00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:17.054 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS ARE HIS ACTIONS AND

00:54:15.686 --> 00:54:18.388 region:rollup2
MAYBE CALL THE POLICE.

00:54:17.054 --> 00:54:19.389 region:rollup2
OR HE COULD HAVE A MEDICAL

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:21.225 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY.

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:23.293 region:rollup2
IN THOSE CASES MANY WOULD BE AT

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:24.394 region:rollup2
THE MERCY OF WHATEVER TRAINING

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:25.896 region:rollup2
OR LACK OF TRAINING.

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:27.264 region:rollup2
.

00:54:25.896 --> 00:54:28.465 region:rollup2
THAT A FIRST RESPONDER MIGHT OR

00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:30.134 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD.

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:31.635 region:rollup2
WOULD DEALING WITH PEOPLE WITH

00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:32.903 region:rollup2
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OR

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:33.570 region:rollup2
MENTAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL FOR ANY

00:54:32.903 --> 00:54:35.606 region:rollup2
CASE.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:37.141 region:rollup2
I AM.

00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.976 region:rollup2
BUT FIRST OR FOREMOST I'M A MOM.

00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:40.444 region:rollup2
SO AND I HAVE SEEN TOO MANY

00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:42.045 region:rollup2
STORIES TO SIT BY AND I ONLY

00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:43.447 region:rollup2
WISH.

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:46.016 region:rollup2
AND FOR MY SON TO BECOME ANOTHER

00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:47.584 region:rollup2
STATISTIC AND. MY FELLOW UAW

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:49.086 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FEEL THE SAME WAY AND

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.420 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR CLIENTS SUFFER FROM

00:54:49.086 --> 00:54:53.190 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES FROM ALZHEIMER'S

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:55.926 region:rollup2

00:54:56.827 --> 00:54:58.896 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE WIDELY

00:54:57.261 --> 00:55:00.397 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTOOD.

00:54:58.896 --> 00:55:01.732 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE ACTIONS OR

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.300 region:rollup2
LACK OF ACTIONS MAY BE

00:55:01.732 --> 00:55:04.868 region:rollup2
INTERPRETED AS BEING DEFIANT HER

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.436 region:rollup2
DRUG INDUCED.

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:08.172 region:rollup2
WHERE AND WHEN FACT IT'S PART OF

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:09.173 region:rollup2
THEIR DISABILITY OR MAYBE LACK

00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:10.774 region:rollup2
OF MEDICATION THAT THEY SHOULD

00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:12.176 region:rollup2
BE ON?

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:13.844 region:rollup2
I'M IN THIS IS WHY WITH THE

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.145 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF MY UNION I HAVE SET

00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:16.680 region:rollup2
OUT TO FIND.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:18.081 region:rollup2
PART OF INDIVIDUALS AND

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:20.751 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE OUR.

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:22.586 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF.

00:55:20.751 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
AND DEPARTMENTS THAT NO THAT

00:55:22.586 --> 00:55:27.291 region:rollup2
THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY TO

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
EDUCATE TRAIN. UP FIRST

00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS AND NO.

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:31.628 region:rollup2
WE CAN CREATE BETTER ALERT

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:33.130 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND TOOLS TO PROTECT

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.164 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE MET MEMBERS OF OUR

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:36.166 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:38.435 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE PARTNERED

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2

AWARENESS MONTH.

00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:11.935 region:rollup2
THIS WAS NECESSARY AS MOST

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.870 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAD NO CLUE WHAT A SILVER

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:15.639 region:rollup2
LAKE IS.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:17.474 region:rollup2
OR THAT IT IS EVEN BEEN EXPANDED

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:19.009 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE ALL ADULTS WITH SOME

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.876 region:rollup2
SORT OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT I'M

00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:21.044 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE'LL BE HEARING

SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:24.481 region:rollup2
LATER ON TODAY AS WELL.

00:56:22.813 --> 00:56:25.249 region:rollup2
MOST RECENTLY WE WORKED WITH I

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:28.051 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IS

00:56:25.249 --> 00:56:28.619 region:rollup2
OFFICE ON A BEFORE THIRTY SEVEN.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.920 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS TO CREATE A STATE

00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:31.989 region:rollup2
WIDE.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:34.191 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:35.726 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY DATABASE FOR PEOPLE

00:56:34.191 --> 00:56:37.594 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES

00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.896 region:rollup2
I'M THE AIM OF AB PRO FOR THIRTY

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.463 region:rollup2
SEVEN WAS TO PRO ACTIVELY

00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:42.733 region:rollup2
PROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION AS

00:56:39.463 --> 00:56:44.668 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:47.437 region:rollup2
IF I NEED HELP PROGRAM DOES. AND

00:56:44.668 --> 00:56:48.538 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WITH THE

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.940 region:rollup2
INTENT TO EXPAND IT TO ALL FIRST

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:51.441 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.876 region:rollup2
I AM THE MAIN FOCUS WAS TO

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:54.544 region:rollup2
POSITIVELY ENHANCE THESE

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:56.847 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW AND THE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:58.315 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. ON THIS BILL BECAME A

00:56:56.847 --> 00:56:59.850 region:rollup2
TWO YEAR BILL.

00:56:58.315 --> 00:57:01.051 region:rollup2
AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE HAD

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:03.253 region:rollup2
MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:04.821 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS. UP AND DOWN THE

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.956 region:rollup2
STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:07.624 region:rollup2
ARE RESEARCH IN OUR

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:09.459 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS FOUND SEVERAL

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:10.861 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES WHO HAVE INTRODUCED

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:12.396 region:rollup2
SIMILAR LEGISLATION.

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:13.030 region:rollup2
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE FOUND

00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:15.032 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES AND DISABILITY

00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:17.668 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS HERE AND STATE

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:19.002 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. ALREADY ADDRESSING

00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:20.270 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:23.340 region:rollup2
AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS ON A

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.907 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.409 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THE

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:27.144 region:rollup2
MOST.

00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:28.779 region:rollup2
MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE PLAN

00:57:27.144 --> 00:57:30.314 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO EXPAND THESE EFFORTS

00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:32.683 region:rollup2
INTO ONE STATE WIDE COHESIVE

00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:34.551 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:35.686 region:rollup2
THAT WAY WHEN YOU ARE SOMEONE

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:37.487 region:rollup2
ELSE TRAVELS WITH YOUR LOVED ONE

00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:39.656 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION YOU INITIALLY

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:41.258 region:rollup2
PROVIDING YOUR OWN LOCALITY.

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:43.193 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE IN

00:57:41.258 --> 00:57:44.461 region:rollup2
THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:45.028 region:rollup2
IF I PROVIDE MY SON MANUALS

00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:46.763 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MODESTO WHERE I

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:48.598 region:rollup2
LIVE.

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:49.866 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE A TRIP TO DISNEY

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:51.568 region:rollup2
LAND OR SEA WORLD AND HE GOES

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:52.636 region:rollup2
MISSING.

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.603 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ALLOW THE FIRST

00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:55.138 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:57.074 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION.

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:59.009 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IN HIS OWN AREA BUT

00:57:57.074 --> 00:58:00.644 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:57:59.009 --> 00:58:01.912 region:rollup2
I'M IT WOULD ACCEPT EXPEDITE THE

00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:03.447 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TIME AND POSSIBLY SAVE

00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:05.882 region:rollup2
MY SON'S LIFE.

00:58:03.447 --> 00:58:07.551 region:rollup2
AS IT IS NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:09.686 region:rollup2
FOR CONVEYING INFORMATION ON

MOTHER.

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.390 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD UNDERSTANDABLY HE

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:15.759 region:rollup2
FRANTIC TRYING TO REMEMBER

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:18.028 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING?

00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:19.696 region:rollup2
AND. LET ME JUST SAY.

00:58:18.028 --> 00:58:21.231 region:rollup2
TELL YOU I INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:22.532 region:rollup2
SON CAN'T WAIT

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:24.801 region:rollup2
FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:26.770 region:rollup2
AGENCIES. TO COLLECT INFORMATION

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:28.071 region:rollup2
BEFORE AN ALERT IS ISSUED OR THE

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.674 region:rollup2
BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ISSUED.

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:32.275 region:rollup2
MY SON CAN BE DROWNING IN A POOL

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:33.377 region:rollup2
OR A RIVER IN A MATTER OF

MINUTES BECAUSE HE HAS NO FEAR

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.650 region:rollup2
KILLER TIME BUT. IT'S VERY

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.985 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:04.053 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY IN AN EMERGENCY

01:07:01.985 --> 01:07:06.055 region:rollup2
PERIOD BUT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:07.724 region:rollup2
AND PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE. FOR

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:09.792 region:rollup2

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:15.899 region:rollup2
OFFICER IS GOING INTO THAT AB

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:18.001 region:rollup2
SITUATION IN THE BLIND.

THE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONAL

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:22.372 region:rollup2

GOING INTO A CALL FOR SERVICE

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.842 region:rollup2

AUTOMATICALLY.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:38.087 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO NEEDFOR A

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.822 region:rollup2
DISPATCHER TO QUERY ANY OTHER

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:41.124 region:rollup2

AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:43.312 region:rollup2
ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE FACT

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:44.981 region:rollup2

NINE TRAINING CRITERIA INTO IT.

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:10.157 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF IT WE DID BY

01:52:08.222 --> 01:52:12.092 region:rollup2
FILMING NEW VIDEOS THAT SHOWED

01:52:10.157 --> 01:52:13.360 region:rollup2
OFFICERS INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE

WITH DISABILITIES OR MENTAL

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.396 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

01:52:13.894 --> 01:52:17.831 region:rollup2
MOST AND FOCUS ON CRISIS TYPE.

01:52:16.396 --> 01:52:19.299 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS AND TEACHING THE

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:21.535 region:rollup2
BILL TRAINING OFFICERS HOW TO

01:52:19.299 --> 01:52:23.370 region:rollup2
COACH THE RECRUITS TO THOSE

01:52:21.535 --> 01:52:25.872 region:rollup2
TYPES OF SITUATIONS.

01:52:23.370 --> 01:52:27.841 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOR WHAT I SAW WAS A

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:29.509 region:rollup2
NEED FOR THE FIELD WAS. THE KNOW

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:31.812 region:rollup2
HOW THIS EIGHT HOUR STANDALONE

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:33.146 region:rollup2
CORE SET OF TOOLS HAVE TO GO TO

01:52:31.812 --> 01:52:34.748 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THE THE TRAINING

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:36.316 region:rollup2
OFFICERS ARE CALLING IN DIDN'T

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:38.185 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:40.621 region:rollup2
CRITERION THE MANDATES WERE. SO.

01:52:38.185 --> 01:52:41.755 region:rollup2
I HELPED THEM TO CREATE AN

01:52:40.621 --> 01:52:44.324 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOUR OUTLINE FOR THE FTO

01:52:41.755 --> 01:52:45.859 region:rollup2
COURSE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE SO

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:46.994 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO SEE THAT WANTED TO

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:48.629 region:rollup2
DO THE COURSE ON THEIR OWN.

01:52:46.994 --> 01:52:49.830 region:rollup2
COULD DOWNLOAD IT CERTIFIED

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:50.697 region:rollup2
THROUGH ME WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:52.866 region:rollup2
THEY HAD GOOD QUALIFIED

01:52:50.697 --> 01:52:54.601 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS AND TEACH THE COURSE

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:55.702 region:rollup2
ON THEIR OWN.

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:57.404 region:rollup2
AND LAST FALL WE PUT UP BUT DID

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:58.271 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW VIDEO WHICH A LOT OF

01:52:57.404 --> 01:52:59.606 region:rollup2
THE OFFICERS LIKE IT HELPS TO

01:52:58.271 --> 01:53:06.146 region:rollup2
ADVERTISE LOOK WE NEED MORE

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:08.081 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

01:53:06.146 --> 01:53:09.716 region:rollup2
SO THE TRUTH CRITERIA THAT WAS

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:11.418 region:rollup2
BROUGHT FORTH IN THE BILL'S.

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:13.186 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THEIR TRAINING HAD TO

01:53:11.418 --> 01:53:13.687 region:rollup2
BE CLASSROOM BASED SO THEY

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:14.421 region:rollup2
COULDN'T GET IT OFF THE

01:53:13.687 --> 01:53:17.457 region:rollup2
INTERNET.

01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:19.393 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTOR LED AND A BIG ONE.

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:21.094 region:rollup2
WAS STIGMA REDUCTION AND

01:53:19.393 --> 01:53:22.429 region:rollup2
CULTURALLY RELEVANT.

01:53:21.094 --> 01:53:23.697 region:rollup2
NO ONE I WAS ASSIGNED TO MENTAL

01:53:22.429 --> 01:53:25.766 region:rollup2
HEALTH TRAINING CRISIS

01:53:23.697 --> 01:53:27.401 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION TRAINING OPPOSED I

01:53:25.766 --> 01:53:29.002 region:rollup2
TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO DOWNLOAD

01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:30.971 region:rollup2
REVIEW EVERY SINGLE COURSE THAT

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:31.872 region:rollup2
EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

01:53:30.971 --> 01:53:33.473 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAD IN PLACE AT THE TIME

01:53:31.872 --> 01:53:35.442 region:rollup2
THAT BILLS. AND BELIEVE ME THERE

01:53:33.473 --> 01:53:36.910 region:rollup2
ARE A LOT OF THEM THIS OWN

01:53:35.442 --> 01:53:38.245 region:rollup2
TRAINING WAS NOT NEW TRAINING TO

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:40.547 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY MANY

01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:42.115 region:rollup2
AGENCIES HAD INVESTED A LOT OF

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:43.650 region:rollup2
TIME AND EFFORT INTO TRAINING

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:45.786 region:rollup2
THEIR OFFICERS IN FACT SOMEONE

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:47.154 region:rollup2
CPT. A MEDICINAL COUNTY HAS HAD

01:53:45.786 --> 01:53:49.356 region:rollup2
FORTY OUR COURSES SINCE THE

01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:49.890 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT THEY

01:53:49.356 --> 01:53:50.324 region:rollup2
BROUGHT OVER FROM MEMPHIS

01:53:49.890 --> 01:53:51.358 region:rollup2
TENNESSEE.

01:53:50.324 --> 01:53:52.459 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS

01:53:51.358 --> 01:53:54.127 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

01:53:52.459 --> 01:53:55.595 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL WAS I DIDN'T

01:53:54.127 --> 01:53:57.831 region:rollup2
FIND ANY OF THEM THAT ADDRESS

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:59.499 region:rollup2
CULTURAL RELEVANCY. AND.

01:53:57.831 --> 01:54:01.668 region:rollup2
THE BILL'S DUE TO INTRODUCE

01:53:59.499 --> 01:54:02.502 region:rollup2
THAT ASPECT TO IT. BECAUSE

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:04.471 region:rollup2
NATURE INDICATORS

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:06.573 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO PEOPLE

01:54:04.471 --> 01:54:08.642 region:rollup2
WHO ARE IN CRISIS. ON CONFLICT

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:10.143 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION DE ESCALATION IN

01:54:08.642 --> 01:54:11.345 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:12.646 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO.

01:54:11.345 --> 01:54:13.880 region:rollup2
.

01:54:12.646 --> 01:54:15.515 region:rollup2
ADDRESS MOSTLY DISTRUST

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:17.451 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS. COMEDIAN STATE

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:22.656 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND PERSPECTIVE OF

01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:24.124 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS.

01:54:22.656 --> 01:54:26.660 region:rollup2
SO I WAS ASKED NGUYEN.

01:54:24.124 --> 01:54:27.694 region:rollup2
AND ASTRONAUTS THE QUESTION YOU

01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:29.262 region:rollup2
KNOW WHY DOES THE TRAINING LOOKS

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:31.898 region:rollup2
A PIECEMEAL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:33.967 region:rollup2
NUMBERS. AND HERE'S THE REASON

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:36.069 region:rollup2
THAT IT LOOKS PIECEMEAL IS. USED

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:37.637 region:rollup2
TO HOP THESE COURSES F. TEO'S

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:39.039 region:rollup2
ARE MANDATED TO DO EIGHT HOURS

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:41.641 region:rollup2
OR IF THEY HAD A FORTY YEAR

01:54:39.039 --> 01:54:42.209 region:rollup2
FORTY HOUR COURSE AND THEY DON'T

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.944 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO THE EIGHT HOURS.

01:54:42.209 --> 01:54:45.979 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AT THE TRAIN CRITERIA

01:54:43.944 --> 01:54:46.546 region:rollup2
OVERLAP THERE IS FORGIVENESS IF

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:47.013 region:rollup2
YOU ALREADY HAD A FORTY HOUR

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:48.849 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:50.684 region:rollup2
.

01:54:48.849 --> 01:54:52.552 region:rollup2
S. B. ELEVEN SP TWENTY NINE HAVE

01:54:50.684 --> 01:54:54.187 region:rollup2
THE SAME EXACT CRITERIA WITH

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:55.555 region:rollup2
VENOM THOUGH THERE'S A LITTLE

01:54:54.187 --> 01:54:57.190 region:rollup2
LAST FOR S. B. ELEVEN.

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:59.159 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S THAT KIND OF AN

01:54:57.190 --> 01:55:00.160 region:rollup2
OVERLAP IF YOU HAD FORTY THEN

01:54:59.159 --> 01:55:01.762 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T NEED THE EIGHT AND IF

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.230 region:rollup2
YOU. HAVE THE EIGHT.

01:55:01.762 --> 01:55:04.564 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAD BUT IF YOU HAD

01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:06.099 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COURSE YOU STILL HAVE TO

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:07.934 region:rollup2
HAVE THE AIDS THERE'S ALL THIS

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:09.269 region:rollup2
OVERLAPPING WITH THE TRAINING

01:55:07.934 --> 01:55:10.871 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHY IT DOES LOOK

01:55:09.269 --> 01:55:11.405 region:rollup2
PIECEMEAL THAT AND.

01:55:10.871 --> 01:55:12.672 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS AND HERE'S THE

01:55:11.405 --> 01:55:14.107 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:15.776 region:rollup2
IN A VERY SHORT TIMEFRAME THESE

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:17.010 region:rollup2
TO NOT GO BACK TO JUNE TWO

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:18.979 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS IS JUST

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:20.580 region:rollup2
JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO

01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:22.315 region:rollup2
FABRIC TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. UM

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:24.017 region:rollup2
TRAINING THIS BEEN DELIVERED TO

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:26.019 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S SB

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:27.154 region:rollup2
ELEVEN AS BETWEEN NINE AS WELL

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:28.555 region:rollup2
AS OTHER MENTAL HEALTH COURSES

01:55:27.154 --> 01:55:29.923 region:rollup2
LIKE THE LA ESOS THIRTY TWO HOUR

01:55:28.555 --> 01:55:31.758 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:55:29.923 --> 01:55:33.794 region:rollup2
SO IN BASIC COURSE IN THIS TIME

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:35.695 region:rollup2
PERIOD. THIRTY PRISONERS PUT ON

01:55:33.794 --> 01:55:36.863 region:rollup2
SIXTY TWO PRESENTATIONS AND RICH

01:55:35.695 --> 01:55:39.432 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:41.001 region:rollup2
FORTY SIX POLICE RECRUITS.

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:43.303 region:rollup2
FOR SENATE BILL ELEVEN WHICH IS

01:55:41.001 --> 01:55:45.405 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE DOWNLOADER CORSETS NON

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:46.907 region:rollup2
MANDATED COURSE. EIGHT PRISONERS

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:48.475 region:rollup2
PUT ON NINETY SIX PRESENTATION

01:55:46.907 --> 01:55:50.110 region:rollup2
RICH TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY

01:55:48.475 --> 01:55:51.912 region:rollup2
SEVEN STUDENTS.

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:53.180 region:rollup2
GUS IS A LOT ABOUT WHERE LAW

01:55:51.912 --> 01:55:54.714 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT IS RIGHT NOW IN THE

01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:56.183 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON HOW POOR IN THIS

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:57.818 region:rollup2
TRAINING IS. BECAUSE THEY DID

01:55:56.183 --> 01:56:00.754 region:rollup2
NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING TO DO

01:55:57.818 --> 01:56:01.988 region:rollup2
THIS TRAINING THEY ON THEIR OWN.

01:56:00.754 --> 01:56:03.757 region:rollup2
DOWNLOADED THE COURSE SAID OKAY

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.925 region:rollup2
LET'S OFFER THIS.

01:56:03.757 --> 01:56:06.626 region:rollup2
SENATE BILL TWENTY NINE WE HAD

THREE STUDENTS.

01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:14.501 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S THE EIGHT OUR STAND

01:56:12.699 --> 01:56:16.069 region:rollup2
ALONE COURSE FOR FTA OWES BUT

01:56:14.501 --> 01:56:17.103 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE ONE

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:18.638 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:20.106 region:rollup2
THREE STUDENTS WERE JUST FTA

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:21.708 region:rollup2
OWES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:23.443 region:rollup2

OTHER COURSES SOME THE

01:56:25.145 --> 01:56:27.948 region:rollup2
PRESENTERS WERE OVERLAPPING SO I

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:28.949 region:rollup2
DIDN'T INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF

01:56:27.948 --> 01:56:30.283 region:rollup2
THEM THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND

01:56:28.949 --> 01:56:31.585 region:rollup2
EIGHTY NINE PRESENTATIONS OF

OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:56:31.585 --> 01:56:34.588 region:rollup2
COURSES ARE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:35.789 region:rollup2
DISABILITY COURSES. AND FOUR

01:56:34.588 --> 01:56:37.457 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE

01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:38.725 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WERE REACHED.

01:56:37.457 --> 01:56:40.427 region:rollup2
SO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:41.628 region:rollup2
OF TIME EIGHT MONTHS YOU HAVE

01:56:40.427 --> 01:56:42.963 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN

01:56:41.628 --> 01:56:44.931 region:rollup2
PRESENTATIONS ACROSS THE STATE

01:56:42.963 --> 01:56:46.266 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA WITH TEN THOUSAND

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:47.567 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT LAW

01:56:46.266 --> 01:56:49.936 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TRAINED IN

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:51.404 region:rollup2
THESE PRESENTATIONS.

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:53.373 region:rollup2
BUT BUT INFERENCES. FARMHOUSE

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:55.041 region:rollup2
CLOSELY THOUSAND PERSONNEL SO I

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:55.876 region:rollup2
MEAN TEN THOUSANDS.

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:57.310 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY IN THAT IS THAT IS

01:56:55.876 --> 01:56:58.612 region:rollup2
THE DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.913 region:rollup2
TO THE NUMBER OF LOT FOR SMALL

01:56:58.612 --> 01:57:01.648 region:rollup2
SIR STATEWIDE.

01:56:59.913 --> 01:57:03.650 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:57:01.648 --> 01:57:04.784 region:rollup2
LA US SO I BELIEVE AS MOST OF

01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:06.620 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE FORTY

01:57:04.784 --> 01:57:07.721 region:rollup2
HOUR COURSES DON'T JUST OFFER

01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:10.290 region:rollup2
THEIR COURSES TO THEIR OWN

01:57:07.721 --> 01:57:12.993 region:rollup2
OFFICERS THEY OPEN THEM UP TO

01:57:10.290 --> 01:57:13.627 region:rollup2
OTHER AGENCIES. AND THAT MIGHT

01:57:12.993 --> 01:57:15.362 region:rollup2
BE DROPPED BACK TO BE LOOK AT

01:57:13.627 --> 01:57:17.163 region:rollup2
LAPD THEY HAVE TEN THOUSAND

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:18.532 region:rollup2
OFFICERS BUT THEY'VE BEEN

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:20.333 region:rollup2
TEACHING THESE COURSES FOR YEARS

01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:21.534 region:rollup2
AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO WE'RE

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:23.570 region:rollup2
NOT TRYING TO START AT GROUND

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:24.738 region:rollup2
ZERO IN TEACHING OFFICERS ABOUT

01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:26.373 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENTAL

01:57:24.738 --> 01:57:28.041 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES THERE'S ALREADY

01:57:26.373 --> 01:57:29.442 region:rollup2
BEEN SUBSTANTIAL GROUND GAINED

01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:31.444 region:rollup2
IN TRAINING PEOPLE THOUGHT

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:34.214 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TO KEEP UPDATED TRAINING

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:37.350 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AS WELL. PRODUCTS OF

01:57:34.214 --> 01:57:37.984 region:rollup2
THE IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAT ONE

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:40.854 region:rollup2
ISSUE I HAVE IS FUNDING BECAUSE

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:41.321 region:rollup2
THE STATE. MANDATES A LOT OF

01:57:40.854 --> 01:57:42.222 region:rollup2
COURSES.

01:57:41.321 --> 01:57:43.590 region:rollup2
THAT HE WILL DO THIS EXPLAINS

01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:44.190 region:rollup2
THE BUT YET FUNDING IS NOT

01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:45.425 region:rollup2
PROVIDED SO IT'S BEEN A BIG

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:47.227 region:rollup2
ISSUE. YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:48.828 region:rollup2
THEY'LL T. PERSONAL SKILLS I

01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:49.896 region:rollup2
MEAN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT.

01:57:48.828 --> 01:57:50.530 region:rollup2
AMONG HIS ORGANIZATIONS THEY

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:51.898 region:rollup2
HAVE A FINITE NUMBER OF DOLLARS

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:53.800 region:rollup2
FOR TRAINING.

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:55.235 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE GONNA PERSONAL

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.202 region:rollup2
SKILLS IMPORTANT SIDE WE CAN

01:57:55.235 --> 01:57:57.704 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THAT OF COURSE OF

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:59.105 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:57:57.704 --> 01:58:00.106 region:rollup2
SO FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:01.808 region:rollup2
IF THEY BELONG TO THE POST

01:58:00.106 --> 01:58:02.876 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:04.511 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUING

01:58:02.876 --> 01:58:06.680 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING EVERY TWO

01:58:04.511 --> 01:58:08.815 region:rollup2
YEARS. AND FOURTEEN HOURS OF IT

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.083 region:rollup2
IS MANDATED FOR PERSONAL SKILLS

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:11.618 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO DO

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:14.154 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS TRAINING.

01:58:11.618 --> 01:58:15.555 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY VEHICLE OPERATIONS

01:58:14.154 --> 01:58:16.556 region:rollup2
FIREARMS TRAINING IN DEFENSIVE

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:18.925 region:rollup2
TACTICS.

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:20.527 region:rollup2
FIREARMS IN THE IRAQ THERE TO

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:21.795 region:rollup2
THE MOST EXPENSIVE COURSES THAT

01:58:20.527 --> 01:58:23.530 region:rollup2
CAN BE OUT THERE AND THEY CAN

01:58:21.795 --> 01:58:24.831 region:rollup2
RANGE UP TO SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED

01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:26.366 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A DAY JUST TEACHING

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:28.168 region:rollup2
OFFICER.

01:58:26.366 --> 01:58:29.402 region:rollup2
FOR THE TUITION ALONE IF YOU

01:58:28.168 --> 01:58:30.370 region:rollup2
LOOK AT TRAVEL COST YOU COULD BE

01:58:29.402 --> 01:58:31.938 region:rollup2
AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:34.174 region:rollup2
FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY FOR A LONG

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:35.442 region:rollup2
FORSMAN OFFICER. IN THAT DOESN'T

01:58:34.174 --> 01:58:36.610 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE COST OF WHAT IT

01:58:35.442 --> 01:58:39.112 region:rollup2
TAKES TO GET HIM OFF THE STREET

01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:39.946 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS THE AGENCY PAYNG IN

01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:41.581 region:rollup2
OVERTIME TO COVER THEM AS WELL.

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:42.916 region:rollup2
SO TRAINING IF YOU LOOK AT AN

01:58:41.581 --> 01:58:44.451 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOUR LET'S LOOK AT EIGHT

01:58:42.916 --> 01:58:45.952 region:rollup2
HOUR COURSELET'S NOT THINK TALK

01:58:44.451 --> 01:58:47.287 region:rollup2
ABOUT BACK PAY. IT'S A

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:49.389 region:rollup2
REASONABLE OFTEN OFFICER ATTENDS

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:50.957 region:rollup2
AN EIGHT HOUR. IN CLASSROOM

01:58:49.389 --> 01:58:52.792 region:rollup2
COURSES DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY YOU

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:53.860 region:rollup2
KNOW FANCY EQUIPMENT WOULD BE

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:55.295 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:57.030 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR TROUBLE COSTS INTO

01:58:55.295 --> 01:58:58.898 region:rollup2
HER FIFTY DOLLARS TUITION.

01:58:57.030 --> 01:59:00.834 region:rollup2
IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT TIMES

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:01.735 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THOUSAND OFFICERS THAT'S

01:59:00.834 --> 01:59:04.170 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT

01:59:01.735 --> 01:59:05.438 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO TRAIN EVERY

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:07.173 region:rollup2
OFFICER IN THE STATE.

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:09.442 region:rollup2
THIS EXPENSIVE. SO I KNOW POSTED

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:11.378 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OBVIOUSLY IF THAT BACK

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:12.779 region:rollup2
OVER YEARS GOING BACK IN TIME.

01:59:11.378 --> 01:59:15.148 region:rollup2
THEIR BILL LOT MORE MANDATES.

01:59:12.779 --> 01:59:17.183 region:rollup2
PUT ALL POST.

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:18.718 region:rollup2
FOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:20.654 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

01:59:18.718 --> 01:59:21.121 region:rollup2
LACK OF FUNDING.

01:59:20.654 --> 01:59:22.322 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE POST BY THE

01:59:21.121 --> 01:59:23.990 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:59:22.322 --> 01:59:26.192 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT WE GET A LOT OF

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:27.827 region:rollup2
UNFUNDED MANDATES.

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:29.462 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE KEEP

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:30.030 region:rollup2
ISSUING RULES AND WE WANT TO DO

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:31.631 region:rollup2
THIS THIS THIS AND THIS AND

FIRE TRAINING DRIVING PERSONAL

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:45.345 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:59:42.509 --> 01:59:46.813 region:rollup2

02:14:53.719 --> 02:14:57.990 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR

02:14:56.488 --> 02:15:01.560 region:rollup2
OFFICERS TO KNOW BY RUNNING MY

02:14:57.990 --> 02:15:03.529 region:rollup2

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.798 region:rollup2
MY CHILD COULD BE RUNNING DOWN

02:15:03.529 --> 02:15:07.633 region:rollup2
HIGHWAY AND GET HIT TOLD BY

02:15:05.798 --> 02:15:08.767 region:rollup2
VEHICLE BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION

02:15:07.633 --> 02:15:11.303 region:rollup2
IS UNAVAILABLE.

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:12.871 region:rollup2
.

02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:15.341 region:rollup2
A POLICE OFFICER WHO MY APPROACH

02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:16.809 region:rollup2
MY CHILD AS AN ADULT MAY FEEL.

02:15:15.341 --> 02:15:18.510 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:15:16.809 --> 02:15:21.380 region:rollup2
THERE THREATENS

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:22.982 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE HAVE TO RESPOND IN

02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:25.017 region:rollup2
NOW IN A WAY THAT CAN BE AVOIDED

02:15:22.982 --> 02:15:25.985 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION. COULD

02:15:25.017 --> 02:15:27.820 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO POLICE

02:15:25.985 --> 02:15:29.588 region:rollup2
OFFICER.

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:31.190 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO HAS A

02:15:29.588 --> 02:15:32.157 region:rollup2
BRAIN INJURY IN PTSD AS WELL AND

02:15:31.190 --> 02:15:34.493 region:rollup2
LET ME TELL YOU.

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:36.095 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES

02:15:34.493 --> 02:15:37.630 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PTSD.

02:15:36.095 --> 02:15:39.231 region:rollup2
AND SO OFTEN SOME BECAUSE IT'S A

02:15:37.630 --> 02:15:40.566 region:rollup2
FIRE FIGHT RESPONSE WHEN YOU

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:43.168 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE.

02:15:40.566 --> 02:15:45.604 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE OR THE ABILITY TO

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:47.640 region:rollup2
REGULATE YOURSELF EMOTIONALLY.

02:15:45.604 --> 02:15:50.242 region:rollup2
.

02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:52.845 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW FROM MY HUSBAND IF HE

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:54.413 region:rollup2
GETS ARRESTED THERE OR. AGENCIES

02:15:52.845 --> 02:15:57.516 region:rollup2
ARE WAYS TO IDENTIFY.

02:15:54.413 --> 02:15:59.151 region:rollup2
AND TO REACH OUT TO THE VA SO

02:15:57.516 --> 02:16:00.452 region:rollup2
THAT MY HUSBAND DOESN'T END UP

02:15:59.151 --> 02:16:01.820 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IN A SITUATION WHERE

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:03.655 region:rollup2

IT DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY WITH LAW

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.759 region:rollup2
