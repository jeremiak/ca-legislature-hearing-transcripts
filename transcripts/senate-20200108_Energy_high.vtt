SECTION SEVEN TEN WAS PASSED V.

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.981
O. I. P. TO JUST DEVELOP

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:12.917
WITHOUT MUCH REGULATION WE WERE

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:14.252
CONSTRAINED BY FEDERAL LAW FROM

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.321
REGULATING WIRELESS RATES TREE-

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.190
AND WE DID ATTEMPT TO ADOPT

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:40.411
EMPHASIS ON. ALLOWING THESE

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.747

A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THIS. I

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.527
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAS BEEN

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:58.329
A BATTLE BETWEEN THE FCC AND

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:01.299
WHAT THE STATE'S CAN DO- YOU'VE

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:02.967

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.836
LAWS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT TODAY

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:06.904
MY UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:10.208
TESTIMONY IS THAT THE FCC TRIED

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.510
TO REASSERT SOME OF THOR EDDIE

00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:13.744
THAT YOU BELIEVE THE STATE HAS.

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:17.648

WEIRD DO YOU BELIEVE THE STATE

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.224
HAS THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.759
NOT EXERCISED THAT WE NEED TO

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.628

BECAUSE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:49.413
COMPANIES DIDN'T FEEL THEY HAD

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.414

WEREN'T BEING WORKED. AND IT'S

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:48.145
CRITICAL TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.713
THE ARGUMENT THAT. WHILE THE

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.381
CUSTOMERS ARE MIGRATING AWAY

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:52.816
FROM THE LAND LINE BUT THAT

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:55.085
LAND LINE IS STILL CRITICAL TO

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.787
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WHETHER

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.396
THE FINDINGS OF THIS NETWORK

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.297
EXAMINATION THAT PLAINLY LAY

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:40.898
OUT WHAT THE CARRIERS ARE NOT

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.299
DOING. WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:43.934
PLACE FOR FINING THEM BUT WE

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.235
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WORKING IF

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:46.637
IT'S SUFFICIENT WE DON'T KNOW

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:47.971
IF THE EXISTING METRICS ARE

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:49.706
ENOUGH IF WE NEED TO EXPAND

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.742
THEM. AND WE'RE GONNA BE

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:52.342
LOOKING AT THAT RIGHT AWAY IN

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:56.180
THIS NEXT YEAR. BUT AGAIN WE

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:57.881
KNEW THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:58.916
WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN.

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:02.052
AND ARE WE- AGAIN HAVING

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:02.653
ONGOING DIALOGUE TO MAKE SURE

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:05.289
LIKE TO SAY THIS. COPPER IS

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.291
MAINTAINED THAT LAOS LAST FALL

SERVICES CRITICAL TO EVERYTHING

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:11.361
THAT WE DO HERE. GOING. FOR IT

00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:12.896
TO END THE SOMETHING TO ASK THE

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:14.431
CARRIERS ABOUT IT'S A VERY BIG

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.200
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:17.935
DISINVEST TING IN THOSE

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:21.505
TRADITIONAL SERVICES THEY- SEE.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:24.374
MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN BROADBAND

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:25.542
ANOTHER SERVICES WIRELESS

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.911

STILL MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS IN

TRADITIONAL LAND LINES WE SEE

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.885
WHAT A VITAL ROLE THEY PLAY IN

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:36.887
EMERGENCIES IN NINE ONE ONE ONE

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:39.656
OTHER. POWERS OFF. IN THOSE

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:42.025
NETWORKS NEED TO BE MAINTAINED.

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:44.061
I THINK WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.496
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK IN COMING

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.665
UP WITH NEW RULES WILL ENSURE

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.500
CONTINUED INVESTMENT I THINK

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:53.837
STRONG LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:54.438
AND HOLDING THE CARRIER'S FEET

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:55.606

CERTAINLY IN MY AREA AS WELL

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.560
AND I THINK THAT THE TO THE

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.095
CHAIRS LEADERSHIP ON THIS SAY

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.464
IT TO HEARINGS WITHIN A MATTER

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.099
OF US SIXTY DAYS IS AN

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:23.533
INDICATION I THINK OF WHAT YOU

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.469
FEEL IS. HOW THE URGENCY THAT

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:26.837

SO ON IT'S THE LEGISLATIVE

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.573
OVERSIGHT THAT SO VERY

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.874
IMPORTANT. IT'S THE DIFFERENT

LOOKING AT THESE PROCEEDINGS

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.196

INDUSTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR I

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:19.449

FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND AGAIN I

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.627
DON'T MEAN TO POINT THE FINGER

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.562
BUT WE ARE ALL IN A PARTNERSHIP

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:35.265
HERE. THE PC HAS TO BE THE

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:38.869

HAVE NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION ON

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.100
THE MOUNTAIN ROAD I'M ON. BUT

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.802
THE LOOK THEY GET MY CAR AND

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.937

VULNERABLE. SPOTS WITHIN THE

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.555

SENATOR STERN. ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.574
IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR ABILITY TO

COLLECT DATA WAS SECTION SEVEN

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.244
TEN. BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY

AUTHORITY OVER VOIP OR I. P.

01:03:40.816 --> 01:03:42.318

THAT SEVEN TEN IS. A SUNSET IT

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.297

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:35.704
OF THE DAY THE QUESTION SHOULD

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:37.272
BE NOT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO

A WORST CASE SCENARIO EMERGED

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.587
AS THE AS LARGE REGIONS OF THE

UPGRADING THE SYSTEM TO WHAT I

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.013
CALL PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE IS

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:35.683
PRIMARILY TO FULL INCREASING

IN STANDARD. TIME IS OF THE

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:10.024
ESSENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.692
DO THIS BY DEVELOPING AND

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:14.628
IMPLEMENTING A STRATEGIC PLAN

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.497
WORKING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:18.666
THE STATE THAT EXECUTES A

VULNERABILITIES HARDEN

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.172
INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILD MORE

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.574
RESILIENT AND WE'VE DONE IT

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.442
SYSTEM. AS WELL SERVICE

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.711
PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT RELY ON A

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.947
PLAN THAT SIMPLY OUTLINES

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:33.948

BROUGHT IN DURING AN EMERGENCY.

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:42.089
BUT RATHER BY BUILDING IT BACK

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:43.224
UP POWER AT THAT IS CAPABLE OF

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.759
SUSTAINING THEIR SYSTEMS FOR

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:47.928
THREE TO SEVEN DAYS ENSURING

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:00.608
BELIEVE THAT THESE COMPANIES

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.843
NOW UNDERSTAND THE REALITY OF

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:05.813

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:17.591
IS SIMPLY INADEQUATE.

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:18.993
COMMUNICATIONS SITES MUST HAVE

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.227
PROPERLY SIZED PLACE GENERATORS

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:21.495

TOWERS EXISTING BACKUP CAPACITY.

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.980
AS WELL A LACK OF SUSTAINABLE

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:40.514
BACK CALL CONNECTIVITY IS

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:43.851
ANOTHER GAP. BACK CALL IS THE

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:45.252
CONNECTION FROM THE CELL SITE

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:47.054
TO THE CELLULAR NETWORK AND IS

01:38:47.121 --> 01:38:48.422
REQUIRED FOR CELL SITES TO

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:50.424
FUNCTION MOST CELL SITES RELY

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:52.726
ON FIBER CONNECTIONS WHICH HAVE

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.728
SWITCHED WE HAVE SEEN DAMAGED

OR DESTROYED DURING A FIRE OR

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:57.898
AN EARTHQUAKE. BACKUP

01:38:57.965 --> 01:39:00.200
CONDUCTIVITY WOULD TYPICALLY BE

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.435
PROVIDED VIA MICROWAVE

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.936

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:05.606
DO NOT HAVE BACKUP MICROWAVE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.207
FOR BACK CALL IN A RECENT

INCIDENT. A LACK OF REDUNDANCY

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.880
IN BACK CALL CREATED SEVERE

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.028
FOR TWENTY THREE HOURS BECAUSE

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:30.464
MANY FLIGHTS DELAYS AND LEAD TO

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:31.332
TWENTY CANCEL CANCELLATION

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:33.233

GOTTEN CAUGHT UP IN THAT. OKAY

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.141
HAVE THE AIRPORT MANAGEMENT

01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:42.543
UNDERSTOOD THE LACK OF BOTH

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:44.578
RESILIENCY AND REDUNDANCY THEY

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.914
MAY HAVE UTILIZE MULTIPLE OTHER

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.582
SERVICE PROVIDERS TO AVOID SUCH

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.117
AN OUTAGE AS WELL. AND

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:50.751
UNDERSTANDING BY THE

FIBER LINE TO CRITICAL

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:56.657
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS EXTREME

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:59.026
VULNERABILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.628
AND SPEAK TO MY FINAL POINT AND

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:02.096
THAT IS A LACK OF SITE

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:05.232
PROTECTION. LIKE THE EXAMPLES I

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:06.300

COMMERCIAL CELL SITES AND

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:11.238
CRITICAL FIBER LINES THAT

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:13.741
BURNED IN THE TWO THOUSAND

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:14.341
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRES WERE

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:17.678
LOCATED. ON THE SAME MOUNTAIN

SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SITES.

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.149
INTERESTINGLY NONE OF THE

PREVENTABLE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.261
TO THE VULNERABILITIES OF THESE

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:36.563
COMMERCIAL SITES LEADING TO THE

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:37.064
DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL

GREATEST TOOLS- THERE'S A REAL

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:06.640

AND THROUGH THAT- INITIATIVE-

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:16.802
THERE THERE MAY BE THINGS FOR

02:01:16.869 --> 02:01:18.904

FORWARD TO RAPIDLY ASSASSIN AND

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:27.279
BUILD OUT THE NEEDS OF

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:28.614
UPGRADING OUR SYSTEM TO MAKE IT

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:31.117
RESILIENT. THERE MAY BE SOME

02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:33.252
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT NEED

THAT EFFORT THAT CAN HELP THE

BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THAT

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:50.369
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WOULD

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:52.838
BE A GREAT PLACE WHERE WE COULD

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:54.540

CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THAT GOES

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:19.865
AND PROBABLY MAYBE STEPPED THAT

02:02:19.932 --> 02:02:21.000
UP A LITTLE BIT AS TIME GOES ON

02:02:21.067 --> 02:02:23.436

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:25.498
BACKUP POWER BUT I WANT TO

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:27.266
ADDRESS SIX I THINK IT'S ONE OF

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:29.401
OUR BIGGEST ONE ABILITIES WHEN

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:29.935
IT COMES TO. OUR STATE WHY

02:03:30.002 --> 02:03:32.805
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. MY

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:34.406
UNDERSTANDING IS- EARLIER THIS

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:37.476
PAST SUMMER OUR UNDERSTANDING

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:39.111
WAS THAT TELECOMMUNICATION

02:03:39.178 --> 02:03:39.645
COMPANIES PREPARED FOR THE

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:43.382
WORST. AND THEN WE GET THROUGH

02:03:43.449 --> 02:03:45.151
THIS SIGNIFICANT POWER OUTAGE

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:47.386
OF IN A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:48.120
WE SAW THROUGHOUT- THE

02:03:48.187 --> 02:03:49.555
CALIFORNIA AND IN SOUTHERN

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:50.122
CALIFORNIA. IT'S CLEAR THEY

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:53.492
WERE NOT. IN IN FACT MY

02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:56.128
UNDERSTANDING IS. SCRAMBLING TO

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:57.496
BRING IN RESOURCES FROM OUT OF

02:03:57.563 --> 02:03:58.697
STATE TO TRY TO KEEP THEIR

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:01.233
GRADE. IN THEIR

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:01.901
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM UP

02:04:01.967 --> 02:04:04.103
AND RUNNING. I'D LIKE TO GET A

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.037
BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:07.373
KNOW ABOUT THIS- AND THEN I'D

02:04:07.439 --> 02:04:08.374
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR YOUR

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:10.376
SUGGESTIONS- IN REGARD TO

02:04:10.442 --> 02:04:14.914
REDUNDANT BACKUP POWER. SO

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.518
THANK YOU. THE FACTS ARE THAT I

02:04:19.585 --> 02:04:21.754
THINK THAT THE THAT THE EVENTS

02:04:21.821 --> 02:04:25.391
OF THE P. S. P. WHERE. YOU KNOW

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:28.093
UNDER UNDER THOUGHT AND- YOU

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.796
KNOW THE EVENT GOT OUT IN FRONT

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:34.500
OF THE TELECOMS- PROVIDERS- AND

02:04:34.567 --> 02:04:36.869
THEY REALIZE THAT- YOU KNOW

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:38.838
THEIR EXISTING CAPABILITY TO

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:40.773
KEEP THEIR TOWERS UP AND WHAT

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:43.275
POWERS THEY HAD OR WHAT BACK

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.076
CALL THEY HAVE BEEN THEY HAD

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:45.377
SOME REGENCY POWER WAS IN THERE

02:04:45.444 --> 02:04:47.413
IN SUFFICIENT. SO THE BASE

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:49.515
SCRAMBLED AROUND IT WAS THE

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:50.816
RELATING NEED QUITE FRANKLY

02:04:50.883 --> 02:04:54.420
AND- AND SO- BACK THAT RESULT

02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:56.355
IN THEM HAVING TO GO. IN STATE

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.724
BUT ALSO OUT OF STATE TO GET-

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.593
EMERGENCY POWER BE HONEST IT

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.794
WAS A LITTLE COMPLICATED

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:03.863
BECAUSE AS THEY CAME TO THE

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:04.830
BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA IF THEY

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.899
COMING FROM TEXAS- THEY DID

02:05:06.966 --> 02:05:07.933
MEET OUR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.835
AND SO THEN- YES HAD TO

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.971
SCRAMBLE TO GET WAIVERS- TO BE

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:13.105
ABLE TO LET THAT MAN UNDER

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:15.441
EMERGENCY ORDER- BECAUSE WE

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:16.976
NEEDED HEM AT THE TIME. IT'S

02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:18.344
REALLY NOT THE WAY WE LIKE TO

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.145
DO BUSINESS I THINK

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.013
COLLECTIVELY IN AGAIN ALL BEING

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:24.016
ON THE SAME PAGE. WE HAVE. WE

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:26.652
HAVE FOUGHT THROUGH. WHAT

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:27.386
CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS LOOK

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:28.721
LIKE IN THE STATE WE HAVE BUILT

02:05:28.787 --> 02:05:30.856
CATASTROPHIC RESPONSE PLANS.

02:05:30.923 --> 02:05:33.626
THAT HAVE VERY DETAILED- DATA

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:36.428
OUTLINED IN THOSE- TO TALK

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:38.697
ABOUT LOSS OF POWER IT BACK TO

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:41.367
COMMUNITIES EXCEPT TRUCK. THAT

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:43.769
THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE AND WHEN

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.604
CAN WE HAVE TALKED TO THE

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:48.474
TELECOMS IN THE PAST ABOUT. THE

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:49.742
FACT THAT GOING OUT OF STATE OR

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:52.912
SIX. A PORTABLE CELL ON WHEELS-

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:54.747
IS NOT A SUFFICIENT FOR THE

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:56.248
KIND OF DISASTERS WE HAVE IN

02:05:56.315 --> 02:05:57.950
CALIFORNIA. I WOULD JUST SAY

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.351
THAT THIS POINT. GOING THROUGH

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:00.653
WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH. I

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:01.820
THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS

02:06:01.887 --> 02:06:03.923
REALLY WHAT THE CASCADING

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.591
IMPACTS AND THE DIRECT IMPACTS

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:07.559
OF THOSE LIFE LINES ARE. SO WE

02:06:07.626 --> 02:06:09.328
NOW HAVE A NEW STANDARD TO

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:11.230
OPERATE FROM. EVERYBODY'S BEEN

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:12.965
THROUGH IT AND I'M HOPING THAT

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:14.233
THROUGH THIS COLLABORATIVE.

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.001
EFFORT WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:18.704
MOVE FORWARD. AND TO GET WHERE

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:20.806
WE NEED TO GET TO YES I MENTION

02:06:20.873 --> 02:06:23.676
MY- MY STATEMENT IS THAT DUMB.

02:06:23.742 --> 02:06:24.743
THEY REALLY NEED TO BUILD AND

02:06:24.810 --> 02:06:26.779
BAKE IN- AS WE DO THIS

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:28.380
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS-

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:31.450
AYE AYE DRAFTING- CAPABILITY

02:06:31.517 --> 02:06:32.718
WITH HIS EMERGENCY POWER THAT

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:36.088
IS. BEYOND FOUR HOURS AND THAT

02:06:36.155 --> 02:06:38.190
IS REALLY PART OF HARDENING

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:40.326
THAT. CAPABILITY WRAPPING FIBER

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:42.394
LINES SO THAT THEY DON'T CRACK

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:45.497
BREAK BURN OR MELT- BEING ABLE

02:06:45.564 --> 02:06:47.032
TO DO DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:47.900
CELL SIZE HARDENING THOSE

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:50.836
SITES- AND IF THERE'S SOME.

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:53.772
REGULATORY OR OTHER KINDS OF

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:55.708
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES WHERE THE

02:06:55.774 --> 02:06:57.042
STATE CAN HELP STREAMLINE THOSE

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:59.044
EFFORTS. I THINK WE'D SIT DOWN

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.312
AND HELP TO DO THAT AND THAT

02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:01.246
YOU KNOW ARE THIS IS RELEASED

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:04.950
ABOUT CRISIS SITUATION BECAUSE

02:07:05.017 --> 02:07:08.721
THERE IS NO WAY. NO WAY. THAT

02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:10.222
WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER YEAR

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.357
LIKE WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:12.925
NINETEEN WE- AS A SOCIETY

02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:14.360
SHOULD NOT EXPECT. THAT WE NOT

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:16.996
ONLY LOSE. POWER TO MILLIONS

02:07:17.062 --> 02:07:17.629
BUT ARE ALL OF OUR

02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:20.265
COMMUNICATIONS ALL OF OUR DATA.

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:21.667
WE CAN'T BE DRIVEN INTO ONE

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.370
SYSTEM. AND THEN THAT SYSTEM

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:26.138
THEN BECOME SO VULNERABLE THAT

02:07:26.205 --> 02:07:28.307
WE LOSE IT ALL BECAUSE LEISER

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:30.576
RISK IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. SO WE

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:31.777
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN SO TIME

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.712
IS OF THE ESSENCE AND WE NEED

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:35.047
TO MOVE FOR WITH A DEFINITIVE

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:38.650
PLAN WORKING TOGETHER TO GET

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:39.218

NETWORK SO THAT SUPPORTS ALL

02:08:35.107 --> 02:08:36.041
THE STATE AGENCIES THAT- RIGHT

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:37.976
OVER THE RADIO SYSTEM. AND IT'S

02:08:38.043 --> 02:08:39.845
OUR NETWORK IS BUILT WITH ALL

02:08:39.912 --> 02:08:43.215
OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:43.782
UPGRADES THAT THE DIRECTORS

02:08:46.585 --> 02:08:48.821
REASSURING ACTUALLY IN THAT

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:51.056
WOULD SUGGEST. INDEPENDENT

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:54.660
POWER SOURCES FROM. CLEARLY

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:55.260
RADIOS ARE BATTERY DRIVEN BUT

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:57.563
THE- RELAY CENTERS AT CENTER

02:08:57.629 --> 02:09:01.333
HAVE THEIR OWN. POWER

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.502
REDUNDANCY DURING A POWER

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:05.504
OUTAGE THAT'S CORRECT IN COURSE

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:06.305
WE HAD TO DO REFUELING

02:09:06.371 --> 02:09:08.207
OPERATIONS TO THOSE GENERATORS%

02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:09.875
AND THAT IS A CHALLENGE DURING

02:09:09.942 --> 02:09:10.509
THE MIDDLE THE EVENT PARTICULAR

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:12.478
IN FIRE AREAS THERE MIGHT HAVE

02:09:12.544 --> 02:09:13.979
BEEN MOMENTARY LAPSES BECAUSE

02:09:14.046 --> 02:09:15.380
OF A FIRE THAT'S EXISTING

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:16.515
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T GET IN BUT

02:09:16.582 --> 02:09:17.716
AS SOON AS IT WAS REFILL.

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:19.918
RESTORE LET ME SAY THOUGH THAT

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:21.787
THE PUBLIC REACHED FIFTY

02:09:21.854 --> 02:09:23.455
RESPOND HERS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

USING CELLS CELLS SERVICES WELL

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.295
THE USE OF THE SYSTEMS. TO

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:33.065
COMMUNICATE WAS IMPEDED RIGHT

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:34.833
THE LAND MOBILE RADIO SYSTEMS

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.101
ARE MICROWAVE NETWORK OUR

FOR REVERSE NINE ONE ONE

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:10.469
NOTIFICATION IN IN THE EXTREME

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:13.338
OF ACTIVATION THIS IS. THE

02:10:13.405 --> 02:10:19.978
CONCERN Là. BUT ONLY OFTEN FOR

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:21.180
SELF SERVICE TODAY I UNDERSTAND

02:10:21.246 --> 02:10:22.314
THAT CORRECTLY WITH A VERY LOW

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:23.382
UPTAKE TOM WAS IN MARIN COUNTY

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:24.416
OF PEOPLE OPTING IN FOR THAT

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:27.653
RIVERS. NINE ONE ONE- WHY IS

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:29.021
THERE THAT DISTINCTION AND

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:31.723
WHAT'S THE REMEDY TO GET WITH

02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.492
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE MOVING TO

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:36.061
ONLY WIRELESS AT THEIR HOMES

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:38.597
HAD WE BUILD THAT INTO THAN

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:40.232
NINE WERE VERSE NINE ONE ONE

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:42.534
WITHOUT REQUIRING AN OPT IN

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:46.238

THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THE

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.156
BACKBONE OF HOW COMMUNICATIONS

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.491
MOVE. THERE'S A VULNERABILITY

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:07.926
POINTS THAT EXIST WITHIN THAT

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:10.629

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:19.171
ARE HIGH POINT WE HAD FOR OVER.

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:21.907
CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION BEFORE

02:11:21.974 --> 02:11:23.041
FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND LANDLINES

02:11:23.108 --> 02:11:25.110
CUSTOMERS THAT'S NOT I AM NOT

02:11:25.177 --> 02:11:26.945
CORRECTION THERE'S STILL SITES

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.547
NOT INDIVIDUAL SEEK MULTIPLIED

02:11:28.614 --> 02:11:30.015
BY THREE LIKE A CHRIS TALKED

02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:31.416
ABOUT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:11:31.483 --> 02:11:33.986
IMPACT IN NOT HAVING THE

02:11:34.052 --> 02:11:35.387
SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THAT THAT

02:11:35.454 --> 02:11:39.424
PORTION OF IT. AND SO WHEN THE

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:42.294
SHARED INFRASTRUCTURES DOWN. AS

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:42.894

MEMBERS MESSAGE TO EVERY PHONE

02:11:48.033 --> 02:11:49.368
OUT THERE IN HIS AREA YOU CAN

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.536
DO THAT. IF THE WIRE LINE WAS

02:11:51.603 --> 02:11:53.038
DOWN HE COULDN'T REACH HIM IF

02:11:53.105 --> 02:11:54.306
THERE OF A CUSTOMER THAT

THE SAME ISSUE IS THE ABILITY

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:18.497
TO COMMUNICATE WAS. DIRECTLY

02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:21.967

PEOPLE DON'T OPT INTO OUR

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:24.136
SYSTEM FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:26.004
REASONS YOU KNOW- VERY

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:27.839
INDIVIDUAL REASONS BUT YOU KNOW

02:12:27.906 --> 02:12:28.573
IT MIGHT THEIR WITH MAY BE

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:30.142
SUSPICIOUS OF GOVERNMENT OR

THEY'RE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:32.177
GONNA GET SPAMMER. BUT THEY

02:12:32.244 --> 02:12:33.245
WERE GONNA SHARE THEIR

INFORMATION WITH- YOU KNOW SOME

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.316
OF THE SOME MAKETERS SOMETHING

02:12:37.382 --> 02:12:38.150
LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:39.351

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:42.454
REASONS- WE CAN GET THE DATA AS

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:44.356
I SAID FOR A REGULAR LINE

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.325
PHONES WE GET FOR CALM FROM

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:47.793
COMCAST NOW WE PUT THAT IN

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:49.628
THERE. SO VERIZON EIGHTEEN T.

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:50.862
THEY SHARE THAT INFORMATION

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:53.031
WITH US BUT- WIRELESS COMPANIES

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:55.400
ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO THAT. I

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:56.668
KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BILL

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:58.870
RECENTLY. I THAT WAS GOING TO

02:12:58.937 --> 02:12:59.938
EXPAND THE DEFINITION I

02:13:00.005 --> 02:13:01.673
UNDERSTAND AND OF YOU KNOW TO

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.608
INCLUDE WIRELESS COMPANIES IN

02:13:03.675 --> 02:13:05.310
AND REQUIRING TO SHARE THAT.

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:06.511
WITH US. BUT I UNDERSTAND IT

02:13:06.578 --> 02:13:08.447
THAT FAILED- WE WOULD LOVE TO

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:10.515
HAVE THAT ABILITY- WE WANT TO

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:11.983
BE ABLE TO NOTIFY AS MANY

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:14.419
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE- YEAH THAT

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:17.155
NUMBERS YOU KNOW 15220% HOW

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:19.391
OFTEN IS. NOT UNUSUAL YOU KNOW

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:21.626
IT TOO WE- WE TALKED OR OTHER

02:13:21.693 --> 02:13:22.861
COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE THAT

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.229
EXPERIENCED THE SAME KIND OF

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:26.198
LOW LEVEL ABOUT THAT YASSER IS

02:13:26.264 --> 02:13:28.500
THIS. THE VULNERABILITY OF LAND

02:13:28.567 --> 02:13:31.770
LINES- YEAH. THE RIVERS AND

02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:32.571
NINE ONE ONE. SO I THINK WILL

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:35.674
BE HELPFUL FOR US AND- NOT AT

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:38.677
THIS MOMENT. IS FOLLOW UP. IF

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:39.311
YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHAT WOULD

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:42.047
BE. SOME WHAT WOULD BE THE

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:50.589
IDEAL COMMUNICATION. ACCESS FOR.

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:51.990
FULLER HUH. RESIDENTS RATE

PAYERS- OF IMPENDING DANGER

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.527
WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE CREATE THAT

02:13:55.594 --> 02:13:57.295
REDUNDANCY IDEALLY FORGETTING.

02:13:57.362 --> 02:13:59.898
ABOUT CARSON. WELL HONESTLY

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:01.533
THEY ALL NEED TO BE ROBUST AND

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:08.240
WE'VE DONE THAT ALL OF THE.

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:09.408
INTERNET NEEDS TO BE UP SO WE

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:10.275
CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:11.243
INFORMATION THERE ACTUALLY IS

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:13.712
NOT ONE PREFERRED. SOURCE OF

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:15.046
NOTIFYING THE PROPER PUBLIC

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:16.515
BECAUSE IT'S VERY. INCIDENT

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:18.016
DRIVEN YEAH BUT ONE OF THE

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:19.718
LESSONS I GUESS IS THE NEED FOR

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.620
REDUNDANCY THE SACRAMENTO

OUT RESPONSES TO NATURAL

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:30.228
DISASTERS. AND PLAN TO POWER

OUTAGES. THIS HEARINGS NOT

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.534
ABOUT POTENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.402
TO TERRORIST EFFORTS TO KNOCK

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:40.338
OUT THE GRID TO KNOCK OUT

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:43.041
INFORMATION SYSTEMS. IN BED BUT

02:14:43.108 --> 02:14:45.477
OUR ABILITY TO PREPARE IN THIS

02:14:45.544 --> 02:14:47.946
INSTANCE I WOULD THINK ALSO

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:50.015
BENEFIT SERVICE IN TERMS OF OUR

02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:52.384

OUTAGES AND I BRING IT UP NOT

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.056
BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:32.657

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:34.793
PEOPLE KNOW BE OPEN BERKELEY

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:36.595
HILLS FIRE WAS THE MOST

02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:39.030
DAMAGING DEVASTATING AND LIKE

02:15:39.097 --> 02:15:41.566

OF OUR SELL EQUIPMENT IS IN THE

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:48.807
BERKELEY AND OAKLAND HILLS

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:51.309
EXACTLY WHERE THE FIRE OCCURRED

02:15:51.376 --> 02:15:53.144
SO OF COURSE THAT IS WHERE THE

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:55.046
POWER WAS TURNED OFF AND WHEN

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:56.047
THEIR POWER WAS TURNED OFF

02:15:56.114 --> 02:15:58.083
THOSE VERY RESIDENTS WHO ARE

02:15:58.149 --> 02:16:00.285
MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO A FIRE.

02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:02.354
DâN DID NOT HAVE FOR MANY OF

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:03.855
THEM EITHER INTERNET OR SELL

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:05.957
ACCESS TO THE VERY WAY AND

02:16:06.024 --> 02:16:07.225
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS THAT

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:09.094
SOMEONE IS NOTIFIED THEY NO

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:14.165
LONGER HAD AND WE THEN WE WERE

02:16:14.232 --> 02:16:17.769
FORTUNATE WE DID NOT HAVE A

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:20.338
SERIOUS INCIDENT BUT THERE IS

02:16:20.405 --> 02:16:23.742
A- IN LAFAYETTE WHICH IS BASED.

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:26.144
ON THE OF THE BILLS AND IN

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:28.780
CERTAIN EIGHT THERE WOULD FIRE.

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:31.816
BERKELEY KENSINGTON AREA.

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:32.851
CONTACT THE COUNTY WAS ALSO

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:33.451
ACTED AND THEN OF COURSE THRE

02:16:33.518 --> 02:16:34.586
WAS THE FIRE IN VALLEJO THAT

02:16:34.653 --> 02:16:35.820
JUMPED THE CARQUINEZ STRAITS.

02:16:35.887 --> 02:16:38.056
IN HIT BY THE NORTHERN PART OF

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:38.623
NORTHWESTERN PART OF CONTRA

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:39.391
COSTA COUNTY AGAIN WITH THE

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:42.661
POWER OUTAGES. THE PEOPLE WHO

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:43.895
LIVE THERE DID NOT HAVE THIS

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:47.732
ACCESS SO- SO WE KNOW THAT

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:49.534
PLACES THAT NEED THIS CRITICAL

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:53.271
INFRASTRUCTURE. WERE WITHOUT IT

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:54.806
AND- THE MAIN BESIDES JUST

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:59.511
BRINGING IT UP. WHEN AS WE LOOK

02:16:59.578 --> 02:17:03.715
AT REQUIRING BACK TO POWER.

02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:05.684
GIVEN WHERE MUCH OF THIS

02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:07.953
EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED TO RELY ON

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.855
DIESEL GENERATORS IN THE MID IN

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:12.757
THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE MOST

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:14.025
SUSCEPTIBLE TO FIRE DOES NOT

02:17:14.092 --> 02:17:15.627
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. NOW I KNOW

02:17:15.694 --> 02:17:20.465
THERE'S- DIFFICULTIES WITH- YOU

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:23.468
KNOW A STORAGE- BATTERY STORAGE

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:26.237
IN SUCH AS A LIMITED HOURS BUT-

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:27.205
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:29.140
TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS AND

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:30.275
I THINK IT'S VERY VERY

02:17:30.342 --> 02:17:34.045
IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY LOOK

02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:36.615
AT. WHAT WHAT TECHNOLOGICAL

02:17:36.681 --> 02:17:39.117
WHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:41.086
AND WHAT BREAKTHROUGHS TO BE

02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:42.787
ABLE TO NOT BE IN A

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.089
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE'RE

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:46.291
RELIANT PRIMARILY ON DIESEL

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:49.995
GENERATION AT ESPECIALLY IN

02:17:50.061 --> 02:17:50.962
THOSE LOCATIONS THAT ARE MOST

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:53.598
FIRE SUSCEPTIBLE. SO I WANTED

02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:57.369
TO JUST LEAVE YOU KNOW IF WE.

02:17:57.435 --> 02:17:59.304

P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AND AS WE

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:40.218
LOOK TOGETHER FOR HOW TO

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:41.653
ADDRESS THEM IN THE FUTURE

02:22:41.719 --> 02:22:43.688
THERE ARE SOME BASELINE FACTS

02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:44.322
REGARDING THESE EVENTS. THAT WE

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:46.424
WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. FOR

02:22:46.491 --> 02:22:48.059
EXAMPLE THE FCC'S COMMUNICATION

02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:50.361
STATUS REPORTS SHOW THAT 96% OF

02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:51.729

OPERATIONAL. DESPITE THE FACT

02:22:55.166 --> 02:22:56.935
THAT OVER TWO POINT SEVEN

02:22:57.001 --> 02:22:57.468
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE

02:22:57.535 --> 02:23:00.638
WITHOUT POWER. SIMULTANEOUSLY

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:02.006
SHUTTING OFF POWER TO A LARGE

MAGNITUDE OF THE PS PS EVENTS

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:17.188
MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:27.732
LONG THEY WOULD CONTINUE. AS

02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:29.033
NOTED WIRELESS NETWORKS ARE

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:29.901

PROVIDING PUBLICLY THE

02:37:38.582 --> 02:37:40.384
PERCENTAGE OF CELL SITES IN

02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:42.419
OPERATIONS IN THE IMPACTED. OUR

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.454
POWER SHUT OFF AREAS IT'S NOT

02:37:44.521 --> 02:37:46.456
SOMETHING THAT WE DID BEFORE-

02:37:46.523 --> 02:37:48.225
WE MADE A CORPORATE DECISION

02:37:48.292 --> 02:37:49.459
THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE MORE

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:52.329
TRANSPARENT. ABOUT THIS AND BY

02:37:52.396 --> 02:37:54.398
ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS WE

02:37:54.464 --> 02:37:57.734
INTEND TO BE TRANSPARENT. THE

02:37:57.801 --> 02:37:58.702
RESULTS OF ALL OF OUR WORK WAS

02:37:58.769 --> 02:38:01.471
THAT OUR NETWORK. SHOWED GREAT

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:03.140
RESILIENCY DUE TO OUR BACK UP

02:38:03.207 --> 02:38:05.242
POWER RESOURCES ARE OVERLAPPING

02:38:05.309 --> 02:38:07.778
CELL SITE DESIGN. AND ARE

02:38:07.845 --> 02:38:10.347
RUNNING TO THE CRISIS WITH THE

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:12.349
DEPLOYMENT OF TEMPORARY ASSETS

02:38:12.416 --> 02:38:15.519
SUCH AS CAL'S COLD SPOTS IN

02:38:15.586 --> 02:38:18.388
PORTABLE GENERATORS WERE NEEDED.

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:21.191
AND SO PART OF THE RESULTS WAS

02:38:21.258 --> 02:38:21.792
FOR EXAMPLE AT THE HEIGHT OF

02:38:21.859 --> 02:38:23.193
THE VENTS ON OCTOBER TWENTY

02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:25.596
EIGHTH. THE FCC REPORTED ON

02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:29.099
AGGREGATE 27% OF WIRELESS

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:29.700
SERVICE CELL SITES WERE OUT OF

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:31.902
SERVICE AND SOMEONE COUNTY. THE

02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:32.836
TO THE POWERSHOT AWESOME WELL

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:35.973
VERIZON ONLY EXPERIENCE 7% OF

02:38:36.039 --> 02:38:37.507
SITES OUT OF SERVICE AT THE

02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:39.943
TIME. NOW THAT 7% IS NOT

02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:41.912
SOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT-

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:43.680
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO BETTER

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:45.515
AND WE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT

02:38:45.582 --> 02:38:47.885
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS OUR

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:49.019
RESILIENCY ACTUALLY SHOWED UP%

02:38:49.086 --> 02:38:51.321
IN THE NUMBERS. THE SAME IS FOR

02:38:51.388 --> 02:38:52.856
MARIN COUNTY MARIN COUNTY THERE

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:55.692
WAS A 57% CELL SITES OUT OF

02:38:55.759 --> 02:38:58.829
SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE- DERS

02:38:58.896 --> 02:39:01.398
REPORTS. ARISES OUT OF SERVICE

02:39:01.465 --> 02:39:04.067
WAS 8% OF ITS CELL SITES BUT

02:39:04.134 --> 02:39:05.335
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT COVERAGE

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:07.070
WAS AL. BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS

02:39:07.137 --> 02:39:09.239
OVERLAP IN THE SIGN AND WE HAVE

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:10.540
THE TEMPORARY ASSETS THAT WE

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:12.542
DEPLOY. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:39:12.609 --> 02:39:15.345
METRIC THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS

02:39:15.412 --> 02:39:18.849
IN THIS COLLABORATIVE. AS WE GO

02:39:18.916 --> 02:39:19.583
FORWARD IN A COLLABORATIVE

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:20.684
MANNER IS WHAT DOES IT REALLY

02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:22.386
MEAN FOR CELL SITE TO BE OUT

02:39:22.452 --> 02:39:23.820
DOES THAT MEAN THAT COVERAGES

02:39:23.887 --> 02:39:25.455
OUT. NOT NECESSARILY AND

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:26.823
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

02:39:26.890 --> 02:39:28.325
REALLY BE CAREFUL ABOUT

02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:30.227
EQUATING CELL SITES OUT WITH

02:39:30.294 --> 02:39:39.269
COVERAGE OUT. WE THINK THAT

02:39:39.336 --> 02:39:40.137
THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR

02:39:40.203 --> 02:39:42.039
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:43.774
THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND

02:51:02.752 --> 02:51:04.120
THIS. BUT FOR DIFFERENT

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:06.823
REASONS. THE IRONIC THING ABOUT

02:51:06.889 --> 02:51:07.657
THIS EVENT WAS IT WAS PRETTY

02:51:07.724 --> 02:51:10.960
MUCH LAID OUT. AS TO WHAT WAS

02:51:11.027 --> 02:51:11.594
GOING TO FAIL MORE OR LESS WHEN

02:51:11.661 --> 02:51:14.030
AND WHERE. IF THE VANCE WE'VE

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:15.765
BEEN INVOLVED IN HAVE AN

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:16.966
UNPLANNED AND THE FAILURES ARE

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:19.402
NOT KNOWN BEFORE THE BEGINNING

02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:19.969
OF THE EVENT. AND WE'RE THE

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:23.940
FAILURES WORLD HER. TO I SHOULD

02:51:24.007 --> 02:51:26.242
PROBABLY HAVE THAT THIS WAS

02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.809
AFTER THE FIRST PSP US ABOUT

02:51:26.876 --> 02:51:31.047
THAT WE HAVE. WHAT IMPACTS DID

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:31.681
THE PS PS INCIDENT HAVE ON YOUR

TELLY. AS WE ARE BATTERIES AT

02:51:35.451 --> 02:51:36.886
ALL SITES AND GENERATORS AND

02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:38.087
ALMOST ALL OF OUR REMOTE

SERVICE DSL ADDRESS FIBER ONLY.

02:51:43.626 --> 02:51:45.128
WE WENT THROUGH MOST OF OUR

02:51:45.194 --> 02:51:47.397
OUTAGE WITHOUT ANY INCIDENTS.

02:51:47.463 --> 02:51:48.798
IN THE MOST CRITICAL PARTS OF

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:50.233
OUR NETWORK AT THE PEAK OF THE

02:51:50.299 --> 02:51:52.468
PSP HOUSE. WE HAD FORTY SIX

02:51:52.535 --> 02:51:54.871
PLUS GENERATORS IN OPERATION.

02:51:54.937 --> 02:51:56.572
WHEN THE INCIDENT STARTED.

02:51:56.639 --> 02:51:57.807
THERE WERE FOUR SITES THE

02:51:57.874 --> 02:51:59.642
GENEROUS DID NOT START WE

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:00.443
CORRECTED TO THE SITES BEFORE

02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:02.545
THE BATTERS RICH PLEADED SO.

02:52:02.612 --> 02:52:03.146
THOSE AREAS NEVER EXPERIENCED

02:52:03.212 --> 02:52:06.416
ANYTHING. ONE OF THOSE SITES

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:07.050
WAS A LITTLE LARGER SO THAT WAS

02:52:07.116 --> 02:52:09.185
A GOOD THING. THERE WERE TWO

02:52:09.252 --> 02:52:10.353
SMALLER SITES THAT FAILED TO

02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:11.688
START AND THE BATTERIES WERE

02:52:11.754 --> 02:52:13.890
DEPLETED. AND WE HAD VERY VERY

02:52:13.956 --> 02:52:15.591
BRIEF OUTAGES ONE OF THE YEAR'S

02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:17.493

HUNDRED EIGHTY CUSTOMERS. THE

OTHER SITE THAT FAILED

02:52:21.364 --> 02:52:22.865
EXPERIENCE ABOUT NINETY MINUTES

02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:25.802
DOWNTIME. BEFORE WAS CORRECTED

02:52:25.868 --> 02:52:26.436
IN THE AFFECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:52:26.502 --> 02:52:28.905
AND FORTY FIVE CUSTOMERS. AS WE

02:52:28.971 --> 02:52:29.939
STRADDLED THE PHASE ONE AND

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:32.809
PHASE TWO LINES. FOR THE FIRST

02:52:32.875 --> 02:52:35.445
PSP ELSE. BEING BEING IN BOTH

02:52:35.511 --> 02:52:36.479
AMADOR CALAVERAS COUNTY WE HAVE

02:52:36.546 --> 02:52:38.381
A SMALL AMOUNT OF AREA. THAT

02:52:38.448 --> 02:52:39.348
HAD THE POWER TURNED OFF ON THE

02:52:39.415 --> 02:52:42.852
SECOND DAY. IT'S MOSTLY A LINE

02:52:42.919 --> 02:52:43.453
THAT FEEDS THE QUIRK WITH SKI

02:52:43.519 --> 02:52:45.988
RESORT DIRECTLY. THERE'S ONE

02:52:46.055 --> 02:52:47.990
VERY SMALL REMOTE SITE. IN THE

02:52:48.057 --> 02:52:49.192
BEAR RIVER AREA THAT FEEDS OFF

02:52:49.258 --> 02:52:51.794
OF THIS PLANET KERR QUIT. WE

02:52:51.861 --> 02:52:52.395
ALSO HAVE A GENERATOR FAILURE

02:52:52.462 --> 02:52:54.764
AT THAT SITE. THE BATTERIES DID

02:52:54.831 --> 02:52:56.699
ALSO GOOD DAD BEFORE ABLE TO

02:52:56.766 --> 02:52:58.801
RECTIFY THE SITUATION AS IT

02:52:58.868 --> 02:52:59.435
TURNS OUT THIS GENERATOR HAVE A

02:52:59.502 --> 02:53:02.071
MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUE. AND WE

02:53:02.138 --> 02:53:02.672
HAD TO PLAY TEMPORARY PORTABLE

02:53:02.739 --> 02:53:06.275
UNIT TO CORRECT. BY THE TIME WE

02:53:06.342 --> 02:53:07.376
HAVE SERVICE IN THE RESTORED

02:53:07.443 --> 02:53:09.412
ABOUT SIX HOURS AND EFFECTIVE

02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:10.480
NO MORE THAN FORTY ONE

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:11.881
CUSTOMERS AS A MATTER OF FACT

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:14.817
IT'S A VERY REMOTE- RESORT AREA

02:53:14.884 --> 02:53:16.586
AND- BY THAT TIME OF THE YEAR

02:53:16.652 --> 02:53:18.454
I'M NOT EVEN SURE ANYBODY WAS

02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:22.024
THERE. BUT WE STILL GOT RUNNING.

02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:23.459
THAT WAS THE EXTENT OF

02:53:23.526 --> 02:53:24.193
ORGANIZATIONS RESPECT OUR

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:26.496
TELEPHONE INTERNET SERVICES. WE

02:53:26.562 --> 02:53:28.264
ALSO PROVIDE VIDEO CABLE

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.032
TELEVISION OTHER INTERNET CABLE

02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:31.934
MODEM SERVICE AND A SELECT AREA

02:53:32.001 --> 02:53:34.003
BOTH COUNTIES THESE ARE ALL

02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:36.672
AREAS WHERE WE ARE NOT THE LACK.

02:53:36.739 --> 02:53:38.541
THIS IS A DIFFERENT NETWORK.

02:53:38.608 --> 02:53:39.809
AND THERE ARE ONLY BATTERIES

02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:40.910
AND NOT GENEROUS AND MOST OF

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:42.979
THE SITES WE LOST MOST OF THESE

02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:44.981
AREAS WHEN THE BATTERIES DIED.

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:47.784
THIS NETWORK IS LARGELY. NOT

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:49.652
MISSION CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY

02:53:49.719 --> 02:53:52.321
I SAY THAT IS WE ONLY DO VIDEO

02:53:52.388 --> 02:53:52.922
ACROSS THAT NETWORK EXCEPT FOR

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:55.224
THE CHAIRMAN EMERITUS. ENHANCE

02:53:55.291 --> 02:53:55.758
HISTORICALLY HAD NOT BEEN

02:53:55.825 --> 02:53:59.395
BACKED UP THE SAME. AS A MORE

02:53:59.462 --> 02:53:59.896
CRITICAL PARTS OF OTHER

02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:02.031

REMOTE OR HIS FAMILY- CALORIES

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:06.969
COUNTY. ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE

02:54:07.036 --> 02:54:07.970
BANNERS TO VIRTUALLY ALL THE

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:10.773
SITES BUT NO GENERATORS WITH

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:11.374
THE EXCEPTION OF TWO CRITICAL

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.309
BACK WHOLE SITES. WHERE WE DID

02:54:13.376 --> 02:54:16.979
DEPLOY PORTABLE GENERATORS. ANY

02:54:17.046 --> 02:54:18.481
SITES WITHOUT POWER QUIT AFTER

02:54:18.548 --> 02:54:19.048
THAT IS A COMPLETELY SWIRLS

02:54:19.115 --> 02:54:21.651
AREAS. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT

02:54:21.717 --> 02:54:22.585
WE SERVE WITH THE WIRELESS

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:23.820
INTERNET WAS NOT AFFECTED BY

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:25.788
THE PSP HOUSE. WHICH IS THE

02:54:25.855 --> 02:54:26.422
REASON THAT WE ONE HAND PULLING

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:30.560
THE GENERATORS. DID YOU HAVE

02:54:30.626 --> 02:54:31.861
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO FORTY

ENOUGH PROPANE. IS A RESOURCE

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:42.872
THAT MIGHT HAVE BECOME AN ISSUE

02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:43.673
A CERTAIN POINT THE VENDOR WE

02:54:43.739 --> 02:54:46.776

KEEP PROPANE TANKS FILLED IN

02:54:48.678 --> 02:54:51.013
THE AREA AS MANY CUSTOMERS ARE

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:55.418
AREAS HAVE HOME GENERATORS. HOW

02:54:55.484 --> 02:54:57.119
DID YOU SET PRIORITIES AND

GOES INTO NETWORK MAINTAIN

02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:11.167
VOTE. FOR EXAMPLE WITH NUMEROUS

02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:13.603
GENERATORS WE ALSO HAVE AN EVEN

02:55:13.669 --> 02:55:14.203
LARGER AMOUNT OF PROPANE TANKS

02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:16.572
AT THE SITES. MANY SITES HAVE

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:17.740
TO LEARN FOR THE GALLON PROPANE

02:55:17.807 --> 02:55:19.976
TANKS. THAT ON AVERAGE ALLOW

02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:21.611
SITE TO RUN FROM THREE TO SEVEN

02:55:21.677 --> 02:55:23.746
DAYS IF THE TANKS ARE FULL MANY

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:25.481
OTHER SITES ONLY HAVE FIFTY

02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:26.616
GALLON TANKS OR IN SOME CASES

02:55:26.682 --> 02:55:28.484
TO FOR THE CONTACTS. AND CAN

02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:29.685
ONLY RUN THE SITE FOR TWO DAYS

HALL TANKS THE VERY SITES IN

02:55:40.396 --> 02:55:40.963
EXCHANGE THE TANKS FOR THE

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:43.933
EMPTY ONES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:44.500
OUR TO VEHICLE MECHANICS ARE

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:48.471
PRETTY MUCH. CLEARLY CONSUMED

AVAILABLE FOR THAT. BUT WE

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:49.932
COULD DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:52.001
CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU

03:01:57.206 --> 03:01:58.073
REFLECTION OF THE WHOLE PANEL

03:01:58.140 --> 03:01:59.041

IS INDICATED THESE ARE ON THIS

03:02:04.313 --> 03:02:06.615
UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION AND I

03:02:06.682 --> 03:02:07.950
REFLECTED ON DURING THE

03:02:08.017 --> 03:02:10.786
BLACKOUTS OF ART IN OUR INCLUDE

03:02:10.853 --> 03:02:13.122
INCLUDE ELECTRICITY CRISIS IN

03:02:13.188 --> 03:02:15.491
THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS TWO

03:02:15.557 --> 03:02:16.458
THOUSAND PROBABLY MANY MANY

03:02:16.525 --> 03:02:17.726
MORE CUSTOMERS ACROSS THE STATE

03:02:17.793 --> 03:02:18.994
OF CALIFORNIA WERE AFFECTED BY

03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:20.796
BLACKOUTS THAN THESE POWER

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.898
OUTAGES THE IT WAS

03:02:22.965 --> 03:02:24.500
UNPREDICTABLE. AND MAYBE NOT AS

03:02:24.566 --> 03:02:26.568
LONG OF DURATION FOR EXAMPLE IN

03:02:26.635 --> 03:02:28.837
THE CASE OF HOW LONG SAY MARIN

03:02:28.904 --> 03:02:30.172
COUNTY'S POWER CINEMA COUNTIES

03:02:30.239 --> 03:02:33.309
POWER WAS OUT DURING THIS LAST

03:02:33.375 --> 03:02:34.877
FIRE BUT- IT WAS CERTAINLY.

03:02:34.943 --> 03:02:36.512
CUSTOMERS ALL ACROSS THE STATE.

03:02:36.578 --> 03:02:40.382
AND UNPREDICTABLE AND SEMI

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:40.883
CONSTANT SO THIS IS NOT

03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:44.953
UNPRECEDENTED. AND YET WHAT TO

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:47.756
DO ONE BIG DIFFERENCE IS. FOR

03:02:47.823 --> 03:02:48.290
MORE DEPEND ON A LAND LINE

03:02:48.357 --> 03:02:52.394
STAND. I AM LESS DEPENDENT ON

03:02:52.461 --> 03:02:53.696
THE COMMUNICATION THING THAT

03:02:53.762 --> 03:02:59.068
REQUIRED A- POWER SOURCE NOW.

03:02:59.134 --> 03:03:03.639
IN THIS CONCEPT OF THAT. WOULD

03:03:03.706 --> 03:03:06.809
WOULD THE DIFFICULTY IS. THE

03:03:06.875 --> 03:03:09.745
LEGISLATURE DID NOT DIRECT. OUR

03:03:09.812 --> 03:03:11.547
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO

03:03:11.613 --> 03:03:11.980
DEVELOP ALL OF THEIR

03:03:12.047 --> 03:03:16.118
TECHNOLOGIES. IN A POWER SOURCE.

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:19.388
YOU ALL DID YOU CHOSE TO. AND

03:03:19.455 --> 03:03:22.257
SO NOW WE'RE IN A SITUATION AND

03:03:22.324 --> 03:03:23.292
EFFECTIVE BEING TOLD LIKE WILL

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:25.294
DON'T REGULATE US DON'T

03:03:25.361 --> 03:03:28.931
REGULATE VOICEOVER PROTOCOL.

03:03:28.997 --> 03:03:29.531
BUT MAKE SURE THERE'S POWER SO

03:03:29.598 --> 03:03:33.669
ARE. OUR SERVICE THAT WE ARE

03:03:33.736 --> 03:03:36.338
PROVIDING TO RESIDENTS THAT

03:03:36.405 --> 03:03:37.306
WE'VE SOLD TO CONSUMERS AS

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:38.273
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.609
THERE THAT THE COMMUNICATION

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:43.746
THAT THEY CAN RELY ON. THE

03:03:43.812 --> 03:03:45.514
SERVER THE EMAIL THOSE ARE

03:03:45.581 --> 03:03:47.216
KINDA UNTENABLE. AND I THINK WE

03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:49.852
HAVE TO PARTNER. AND WE HAVE TO

03:03:49.918 --> 03:03:53.489
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE A

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:55.124
COMMUNICATION SERVICE THAT IS

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:57.793
LESS DEPENDENT ON POWER BECAUSE

03:03:57.860 --> 03:03:58.360
WE CANNOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE

03:03:58.427 --> 03:03:58.994
ABLE TO GUARANTEE IT WE'RE JUST

03:03:59.061 --> 03:04:01.263
NOT. AND FOR A WHOLE. REASONS

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:04.333
LOOK AT AUSTRALIA. AND WE COULD

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.002
FACE THAT OR AN EARTHQUAKE OF

03:04:07.069 --> 03:04:09.738
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE YOU KNOW

03:04:09.805 --> 03:04:11.206
EVERY EVERY PREDICTION THE

03:04:11.273 --> 03:04:12.674
VARIOUS FAULTS IN THE STATE OF

03:04:12.741 --> 03:04:15.110
CALIFORNIA CAN EASILY HAVE THE

03:04:15.177 --> 03:04:16.478
TYPE OF EARTHQUAKES THAT ARE

03:04:16.545 --> 03:04:18.280
FAR WORSE MAGNITUDE THAT WE

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:20.282
CURRENTLY HAVE SO WE NEED TO BE

03:04:20.349 --> 03:04:21.550
PARTNERS IN THIS AND THEY'RE

03:04:21.617 --> 03:04:22.818
PROBABLY WILL NEED TO BE

03:04:22.885 --> 03:04:25.587
ADDITIONAL REGULATION AS MUCH

03:04:25.654 --> 03:04:27.156
AS THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT LOVE

03:04:27.222 --> 03:04:29.458
IT SO. PARTNER WITH US TO

03:04:29.525 --> 03:04:31.393
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT

03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:33.862
BECAUSE ARE CONSUMERS BELIEVE

03:04:33.929 --> 03:04:36.231
THAT THEY HAVE. A COMMUNICATION

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:38.434
SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN RELY ON.

03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:40.102
AND THEN ALL OF OUR EMERGENCY

03:04:40.169 --> 03:04:41.770
PROTOCOLS OR BASED ON IT NOW

03:04:41.837 --> 03:04:44.973
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. IN MY

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:48.777
AREA WHERE THE EARTHQUAKE

03:04:48.844 --> 03:04:50.979
PREPAREDNESS PEOPLE COME TO YOU

03:04:51.046 --> 03:04:51.513
AND ORIENT YOU TO WHAT YOU

03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:55.384
SHOULD GET. THEY ADVOCATE FOR

03:04:55.451 --> 03:04:56.985
BATTERY OPERATED OR SOLAR CRANK

03:04:57.052 --> 03:05:00.022
OPERATED RADIOS. AND THEY TELL

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:02.558
EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE THAT IN

03:05:02.624 --> 03:05:03.625
YOUR PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR

03:05:03.692 --> 03:05:05.294
EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS THAT

YOU MAY NOT RELY ON YOUR

03:05:08.130 --> 03:05:10.232
CELLULAR PHONE NOW THE PROBLEM

03:05:10.299 --> 03:05:12.868
IS THAT PEOPLE THAT IS NOT A

03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:14.770
UNIVERSAL UNDERSTOOD THING AND

03:05:14.837 --> 03:05:17.105
WE'VE NOT SET UP OUR EMERGENCY

03:05:17.172 --> 03:05:18.574
COMMUNICATIONS TO BE THROUGH

03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:20.509
THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM. BUT IF

03:05:20.576 --> 03:05:23.412
THAT'S THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WE

03:05:23.479 --> 03:05:24.046
NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS THEN AGAIN

03:05:24.112 --> 03:05:24.646
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PARTNER

03:05:24.713 --> 03:05:29.618

03:05:29.685 --> 03:05:34.022
TURN TO US NOW AND SAY. THAT WE

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:37.559

ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS

03:10:29.885 --> 03:10:32.420
IN THESE MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES

03:10:32.487 --> 03:10:34.022
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE

03:10:34.089 --> 03:10:35.490
PREPARED FOR THE WORST A MATTER

03:10:35.557 --> 03:10:38.026

CYBER ATTACK- WE HAVE TO BE

03:10:47.602 --> 03:10:48.136
PREPARED WITH RESILIENT AND WE

03:10:48.203 --> 03:10:51.239
DONE SYSTEMS. SO FIRST OF ALL

03:10:51.306 --> 03:10:52.274
LET MEANS WE START TALKING

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:54.643
ABOUT REAL NUMBERS I APPRECIATE

03:10:54.709 --> 03:10:56.912
ABOUT THE 7% OF RISING DISCUSS

03:10:56.978 --> 03:10:58.580
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

03:10:58.647 --> 03:10:59.014
REAL NUMBERS. ABOUT

03:10:59.080 --> 03:11:01.349
CALIFORNIANS. IN THE STAFF

03:11:01.416 --> 03:11:03.518
REPORT IS ONE POINT ONE

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:03.952
APPROXIMATE MILLION

03:11:04.019 --> 03:11:05.654
CALIFORNIANS WE HEARD TODAY.

03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:07.889
FROM REPRESENTATIVES TWO

03:11:07.956 --> 03:11:08.490
MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT WERE

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:13.428
IMPACTED. FROM THEIR CELL CABLE

03:11:13.495 --> 03:11:20.135
OUR LAND LINES BEING DOWN. FOUR

03:11:20.202 --> 03:11:20.735
HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ON

03:11:20.802 --> 03:11:21.803
CABLE LAND LINE ALONE AND

03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:22.537
THAT'S A MULTIPLYING FACTOR BY

03:11:22.604 --> 03:11:27.209
THREE. SO I THINK THAT'S THE

03:11:27.275 --> 03:11:27.843
REAL NUMBER WE NEED TO FOCUS IN

03:11:27.909 --> 03:11:28.343
ON IN HOW WE'RE GOING TO

03:11:28.410 --> 03:11:34.683
IMPROVE THAT. BACKUP POWER IS

03:11:34.749 --> 03:11:37.786
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NOW. AND

03:11:37.853 --> 03:11:38.720
JUST BEING CANDID MANY OF YOU

03:11:38.787 --> 03:11:40.322
WERE IN THE ROOM. I REPRESENT

03:11:40.388 --> 03:11:44.359
IS TOLD US. THAT YOU ALL WERE

03:11:44.426 --> 03:11:50.365
PREPARED FOR THE WORST. AND WE

03:11:50.432 --> 03:11:52.133
FAST FORWARD TO LATE SUMMER AND

03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:54.135
INTO THE FALL. AND THE WORST

03:11:54.202 --> 03:11:57.372
HAPPENED. AND WE SHOULD HAVE

03:11:57.439 --> 03:12:01.009
BEEN PREPARED FOR THAT. SO NOW

03:12:01.076 --> 03:12:05.180
WE'RE HERE. THREE THAT WE'RE

03:12:05.247 --> 03:12:05.680
NOT GONNA HIT A HUNDRED

03:12:05.747 --> 03:12:07.415
PERCENT. AGREE WITH THAT. BUT

03:12:07.482 --> 03:12:10.719
YOU NEED TO START WITH THE PLAN.

03:12:10.785 --> 03:12:12.153
SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS GOING

03:12:12.220 --> 03:12:12.787
TO COME FROM THIS HEARING VIEW

03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:15.390
FULL NUMBER ONE A PLANE'S GONNA

03:12:15.457 --> 03:12:16.558
BE PROVIDED BY BOTH

03:12:16.625 --> 03:12:17.559
TELECOMMUNICATION CABLE TO THE

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:19.628
OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES ABOUT

03:12:19.694 --> 03:12:20.128
HOW YOU CAN MAKE A MORE

03:12:20.195 --> 03:12:23.865
RESILIENT SYSTEM. NUMBER TWO IF

03:12:23.932 --> 03:12:24.299
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:12:24.366 --> 03:12:26.067
COLLABORATION. IT'S A TWO WAY

03:12:26.134 --> 03:12:28.236
STREET. WE CAN'T HIDE BEHIND

03:12:28.303 --> 03:12:29.437
WERE FEDERALLY REGULATED

03:12:29.504 --> 03:12:32.274
UTILITY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:32.807
MOVE FORWARD AND SAY WE'RE

03:12:32.874 --> 03:12:34.342
GONNA BE COLLABORATIVE. WE'RE

03:12:34.409 --> 03:12:36.745
GONNA PROVIDE INFORMATION. AND

03:12:36.811 --> 03:12:38.413
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT NOT JUST

03:12:38.480 --> 03:12:40.649
LARGE NUMBERS ABOUT HOW MUCH

03:12:40.715 --> 03:12:41.082
WE'RE INVESTING BUT

03:12:41.149 --> 03:12:41.549
SPECIFICALLY HOW WE'RE

03:12:41.616 --> 03:12:43.551
INVESTING IN. AND WHAT THE

03:12:43.618 --> 03:12:45.020
OUTCOME OF THAT INVESTMENTS CAN

03:12:45.086 --> 03:12:45.587
BE FOR RESILIENCY WITHIN THE

03:12:45.654 --> 03:12:47.989
SYSTEM. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE

03:12:48.056 --> 03:12:49.758
WILL NOT HAVE THE METRICS TO BE

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:52.827
ABLE TO DEFINE SUCCESS. THE

03:12:52.894 --> 03:12:56.197
LAST PIECES STREAMLINING ALL

03:12:56.264 --> 03:12:56.798
FOR STREAMLINING BUT HAS BEEN

03:12:56.865 --> 03:12:59.301
THE NAME OF PUBLIC SAFETY. IT

03:12:59.367 --> 03:13:01.569
CAN'T BE SMS SAID A NEW

03:13:01.636 --> 03:13:04.739
BUSINESS MODEL IN THE STATE. SO

03:13:04.806 --> 03:13:06.274
WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT THERE

03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:07.842
ARE GONNA BE COMPROMISES WE

03:13:07.909 --> 03:13:09.778
MOVE FOR THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY I

03:13:09.844 --> 03:13:12.614
HAVE A BIAS AS THE AREA THAT I

03:13:12.681 --> 03:13:13.815
PROBABLY REPRESENT WITH SENATOR

03:13:13.882 --> 03:13:16.418
DODD WAS IMPACTED DRAMATICALLY

03:13:16.484 --> 03:13:17.552
BY THE LOSS OF

03:13:17.619 --> 03:13:20.488
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CABLE

03:13:20.555 --> 03:13:22.624
LANDLINE CELL. CABLE MAINLINE.

03:13:22.691 --> 03:13:24.726
AND WHAT I WOULD HOPE. IS THAT

03:13:24.793 --> 03:13:26.227
THIS COLLABORATION WILL BE A

03:13:26.294 --> 03:13:28.563
TWO WAY STREET. WE WILL BE ABLE

03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:30.632
TO BE CONFIDENTIAL MOVING

03:13:30.699 --> 03:13:32.934
FORWARD ON CONCERNS. AS WE SIT

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:35.337
AROUND THAT TABLE- AND THEN

03:13:35.403 --> 03:13:36.671
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO MOVE

03:13:36.738 --> 03:13:38.673
FORWARD TOGETHER NINETEEN SURE

03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:39.941
THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE

03:13:40.008 --> 03:13:42.077
SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE COME TO

03:13:42.143 --> 03:13:45.413
RELY ON. I AND THAT WOULD BE MY

03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:46.014
OWN COMES THINK THANK YOU SIR

I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND

03:13:58.426 --> 03:14:00.095
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF THAT

03:14:00.161 --> 03:14:03.031
AS YOU KNOW I STATED EARLIER

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:05.800
WHEN THE PC WAS UP HERE ABOUT.

03:14:05.867 --> 03:14:07.469
WE HAVE A LOT OF I HAVE A LAND

03:14:07.535 --> 03:14:08.103
LINE IN MY HOME BECAUSE MY CELL

03:14:08.169 --> 03:14:12.440
SERVICE. THE SOCKS HOUSE OUT

A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS DO IN

03:14:17.012 --> 03:14:18.913
THE IN THE ROLE AREAS BUT WE

03:14:18.980 --> 03:14:20.615
KNOW THAT THERE ARE LIKE EIGHT

03:14:20.682 --> 03:14:22.617
MILLION PEOPLE THAT HAVE LAND

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:24.252
LINES AND FORTY FOUR MILLION

03:14:24.319 --> 03:14:26.955
PEOPLE THAT USE. NEWS IS THIS

03:14:27.022 --> 03:14:30.625
FOR THEIR MAIN HOME USE AND

03:14:30.692 --> 03:14:32.460
IT'S ABOUT MAKING MONEY IN

03:14:32.527 --> 03:14:34.729
PROFITS AND THAT'S WHERE THE

03:14:34.796 --> 03:14:35.697
THAT'S WORSE DRIVING THE MOVE

03:14:35.764 --> 03:14:39.367
TO. YOU KNOW SELL SERVICES AND

03:14:39.434 --> 03:14:40.635
MOBILE DEVICES. IT IS ALSO WHAT

03:14:40.702 --> 03:14:42.837
THE PUBLIC WANTS. BUT THE SAME

03:14:42.904 --> 03:14:44.539
TIME WE STILL NEED TO HAVE THAT

03:14:44.606 --> 03:14:45.974
INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU CENTER

03:14:46.041 --> 03:14:47.609
FOR CENTER BRADFORD PRODUCTS OF

03:14:47.675 --> 03:14:49.210
WHAT I'M I'M NOT EXPERT IN.

03:14:49.277 --> 03:14:51.246
WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY

03:14:51.312 --> 03:14:52.280
NEEDS BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT

03:14:52.347 --> 03:14:55.917
IT DOESN'T WORK FOR. THE

03:14:55.984 --> 03:14:56.484
CONSTITUENTS I REPRESENT IS

03:14:56.551 --> 03:15:00.688
THAT. WHEN WE HAD A CAMPFIRE WE

03:15:00.755 --> 03:15:01.956
COULDN'T COMMUNICATE WITH

03:15:02.023 --> 03:15:03.725
PEOPLE TO GET THEM GOING IN THE

03:15:03.792 --> 03:15:04.325
RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY

03:15:04.392 --> 03:15:05.326
WERE GOING IN THE WRONG

03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:08.663
DIRECTION. TWICE VOTED FOR THE

03:15:08.730 --> 03:15:10.331
FEE ON THE NINE ONE ONE IS TO

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:13.101
GET THAT IN PLACE. SO IS IT THE

03:15:13.168 --> 03:15:15.236
LAN IS IT THE COPPER LINES OR

03:15:15.303 --> 03:15:17.138
THE FIBER OPTIC LINES THAT THAT

03:15:17.205 --> 03:15:19.174
REALLY CARRY THE LOAD THEY DO.

03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:21.976
SOME POINT THIS HAS TO GO TO

03:15:22.043 --> 03:15:22.544
SOMETHING THAT TRANSMITS IT

03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:25.480
SOMEWHERE I'M ASSUMING. SO I

03:15:25.547 --> 03:15:27.449
WANT TO KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE

03:15:27.515 --> 03:15:27.849
FOR THAT BACKBONE

03:15:27.916 --> 03:15:32.720
INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IT EIGHTEEN

03:15:32.787 --> 03:15:34.189
T. IS IT COMCAST WHO WHO

03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:37.792
ACTUALLY. IS RESPONSIBLE TO

03:15:37.859 --> 03:15:40.161
MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS IT YES.

KITTERY ANSWER THAT QUESTION

03:15:40.795 --> 03:15:45.233

TO WHOEVER I WANNA BREAKS IT'S

03:15:46.901 --> 03:15:48.870
BROKEN AND NOBODY MAINTAINS IT

03:15:48.937 --> 03:15:49.471
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY.

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:52.707
I CAN'T GET. PROVIDERS TO COME

03:15:52.774 --> 03:15:55.643
TO MY COMMUNITIES. WHERE THEY

03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:56.277
CAN'T MAKE A PROFIT EVEN THOUGH

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:56.878
WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THEM TO DO

03:15:56.945 --> 03:16:00.048

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:01.816
THE END OF THE DAY I NEED TO BE

IN PLACE. FOUR EIGHT AB SIXTEEN

03:16:18.666 --> 03:16:19.167
SIXTY TWO I BELIEVE WAS THE

03:16:19.234 --> 03:16:21.069
NUMBER. I WORKED WITH THAT I

03:16:21.136 --> 03:16:22.170

TYPICALLY LOCATED IN RURAL

03:34:10.804 --> 03:34:13.941
AREAS THEY COMBINE THAT TRAFFIC

FROM MORAN EARLIER THIS MORNING

03:34:35.362 --> 03:34:37.631
IT IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

03:34:37.698 --> 03:34:38.232
THAT SOME OF THESE LINES WERE

03:34:38.298 --> 03:34:40.634
SERVED BY A REMOTE TERMINALS-

03:34:40.701 --> 03:34:42.336
THE COMMISSION HAS THE

03:34:42.402 --> 03:34:43.971
AUTHORITY. TO REQUIRE THESE

03:34:44.037 --> 03:34:46.273
CARRIERS TO MAINTAIN THIS

03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:48.041
EQUIPMENT AND TO ENSURE THAT

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:51.578
THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE

REGULATED COPPER NETWORK. AND

03:34:54.114 --> 03:34:55.182
WE BELIEVE THE COMMISSION

03:34:55.249 --> 03:34:58.719
SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY TO INST TO

03:34:58.785 --> 03:35:01.822
DO THIS TO ENFORCE IT TO MAKE

03:35:01.888 --> 03:35:03.690
SURE THAT. THERE IS AN HOUR AND

03:35:03.757 --> 03:35:05.525
WE ANTICIPATE THE NETWORK

03:35:05.592 --> 03:35:07.294
EXAMINATION TO SEE WHAT THEY

IS THAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA

03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:16.536

WAS CAUSED BY THIS- THAT

03:35:38.659 --> 03:35:40.460

03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:15.015
MOVING TO CONFIDENTIALITY. WE

03:38:15.081 --> 03:38:15.615
WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

03:38:15.682 --> 03:38:16.817
THE FCC IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

CHILD FOR THE NEED FOR DIVERSE

03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:57.958
ROUTING I THINK IS MENDOCINO

03:38:58.024 --> 03:39:00.060
COUNTY BECAUSE WHEN THE FIBER

THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN DAMAGE

THEY STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE

03:40:08.328 --> 03:40:10.163

A BUSINESS STANDPOINT THAT A

03:43:44.944 --> 03:43:47.680

MAYBE- THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE

03:43:53.653 --> 03:43:54.721
WITH THE RESTAURANT THEY DON'T

03:43:54.788 --> 03:43:55.688
KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA BE OPEN

03:43:55.755 --> 03:43:56.656
THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO

03:43:56.723 --> 03:43:59.225
REPORT TO WORK- IF THEY REPORT

03:43:59.292 --> 03:44:00.860
