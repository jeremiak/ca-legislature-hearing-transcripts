ADMINISTRATION WE'VE TO OUT OF THE FOLLOWING CALENDAR AND FIFTEEN ITEMS TO BE HEARD. WE WERE ROLL CALL DISTURBS CORDLESS COOPER HERE CHIU. LACKEY NAZARIAN WICKS. KEVIN MOTION ON THE ONLY CALENDAR. OKAY ROLL CALL PLEASE COOPER HI -- TO LACKEY NAZARIAN CLICKS. GET TEXAS WERE FIRST I'M A BUSINESS THAT WILL BE -- THE NUMBER ONE ASSEMBLY HOUSING HOMELESS PROPOSAL. ISSUE ONE OUTLINES THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING HOMELESS PRIORITIES THESE PRIORITIES REFLECT FEEDBACK FROM BOTH MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AS WE HEAD INTO THE MAY REVISE THIS PROPOSAL WORSE THAN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. INCLUDING USING THE MOST PART. THE SAME FUNDING LEVELS. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE FOR THE PLANNING OF PRODUCTION GRANTS THERE'S AN EMPHASIS ON NOT USING TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. INCLUDING SB ONE IN FOCUSING THE FIVE OR MILLION SAID FUNDING SPECIFICALLY ON HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR HOMELESSNESS HE SIMPLY PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY A PROGRAM. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET. THE HEAT PROGRAM INCLUDE FLEXIBILITY WHICH BASED ON INPUT IS SOMETHING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS LIKE FROM LAST YEAR. UNDER TAX CREDITS SELECT THE GOVERNOR IS SIMPLY PROPOSAL SUPPORT EXPANDING THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. PROGRAM UTILIZED THE 4% CREDITS. FINALLY THE ASSEMBLY PLAN THE FIRST IS THE CORPORAL SOUL TO THE POLICY PROCESS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS. THIS WEEK'S -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE PRESENTATION I AM PLEASED WITH THE FRAMEWORK THAT'S MOVING FORWARD AND HAVE A BIG INTEREST EXPANDING. KEEP IN PARTICULAR THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- AS YOU MAY KNOW I DO HAVE A BILL THAT CREATES A STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR REPORTING. THE CRITICAL THAT ON THE HOMELESSNESS THAT WE NEED TO THINK TO SOLVE THE THE PROBLEM -- SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- WE INCLUDE DATA COLLECTION ON THE FOLLOWING THINGS -- HOMELESSNESS DEMOGRAPHICS -- ABILITY AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THE CURRENT PROJECTED SUPPLY VERY SICK COMBINATION UNITS FOR HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURE POPULATIONS -- AND THE NUMBER PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING UNITS EXTREMELY LOW HOUSING UNITS AND EMERGENCY SHELTER BEDS WITHIN EACH COUNTY. I THINK THAT THE MORE WE COLLECT THIS DATA THE MORE THAT WE HAVE STANDARDIZED DATA WE CAN THEN FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS -- AND SOUL FOR THE PROBLEM THAT I KNOW FACES MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES I KNOW MY DISTRICT WE HAVE ABOUT A 40% INCREASE IN HOMELESS AS THE LAST TWO YEARS -- SITTING HAVING THAT KIND OF STANDARDIZED DATA -- WILL BE HELPFUL FOR US. THANK YOU MISTER. TO LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR MOVING FOR THESE PROPOSAL CERTAINLY THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS FRAMEWORK FROM THE ASSEMBLY SIDE INTO HOPE THAT -- WE WILL HAVE FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO BRANCHES A FEW THINGS THAT I JUST WANNA MENTION FROM MY STANDPOINT -- HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT -- WE CERTAINLY NEED THAT -- THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS MY HOPE IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FOR ONE YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S ENOUGH DEMAND TODAY TO USE THE ENTIRE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- BUT AS I'VE BEEN PROPOSING FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND I THINK THERE'S TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AROUND THE STATE WIDE. IN OUR HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. WE NEED TO HAVE AN ON GOING BASIS FOR AN INCREASE IN THE TAX CREDIT WE KNOW THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE PLANNING THEIR FINANCING YEARS IN ADVANCE WE KNOW THAT BANKS. THAT PURCHASED THESE TAX CREDITS DO -- PLANNING YEARS IN ADVANCE AND THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT TAX CREDITS ARE AVAILABLE IT'S IMPORTANT PROVIDE SOME PREDICTABILITY TO THE MARKET PLACE AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. HOW WE MAKE THE TAX RATE ON GOING -- I WANNA SAY WITH REGARDS -- TO THE MONEY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR MISSING MIDDLE PRODUCTION IT IS. AN AREA THAT I WOULD SUPPORT I WOULD JUST MENTION -- THAT WE HAVE HAD A PROPOSAL FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO HELP AND SENT MISSING MIDDLE PRODUCTION THROUGH AB -- SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR THAT WOULD -- PROPOSE A PROPERTY TAX WELL FOR EXEMPTION IN RETURN FOR A COMMITMENT -- THAT A DEVELOPER BE ABLE TO DEVELOP -- RENTS AND OR OR PRODUCTION THAT -- INVOLVES UNITS WITH RENTS BELOW MARKET RATE I THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF STRUCTURE WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER GIVING THAT THIS IS PRODUCTION -- THAT WOULD NOT LEVERAGE OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING. WITH REGARDS TO THE INCREASE HOMELESSNESS DOLLARS -- THERE WERE DISCUSSING CERTAINLY AGAIN SUPPORT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING BUT I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN ONE TIME FUNDING. AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS WHEN WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO GET SOLVED OVERNIGHT AND I THINK WE NEED TO THINK A BIT MORE STRATEGICALLY ABOUT THIS -- AS FAR AS A MANY THE HE PROGRAM AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAINTAIN FOR FLEXIBILITY BUT WE ALSO FOCUS ON EVIDENCE SPACES EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO HOMELESSNESS THAT WORK. LONG TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT BASED HOUSING VOUCHERS TIED TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING. OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND EMERGENCY SHELTERS IN ADDITIONAL IN ADDITION A FUNNY NAVIGATION CENTERS. WE HAVE TO THINK OF HOW WE T&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; PROGRAM FUNDS TO OUTCOMES IT MOVE PEOPLE TO PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK FOCUS A GOOD CHUNK OF THIS MONEY ON CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THEN I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT -- MS WICKS JUST SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING DATA I KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND EIGHT CD IS TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH -- A STATE DATA WAREHOUSE SO THAT WE COORDINATE STATE ILLEGAL RE LOCAL RESOURCES TO RESPOND HOMELESSNESS I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO FULLY STAFF THE HOMELESS FINANCING AND COORDINATING COUNCIL SO THEY CAN REALLY FOR FILL THEIR ROLE. ON ON BOTH OF THOSE RESPECTS ONE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION IS. THERE IS MONEY FOR PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS THAT I SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE THE STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED AND THIS FRAMEWORK. ONE WEEK I WOULD ASK FOR IT IS THERE ARE TRANSIT AGENCIES THAT ARE ALSO WORKING -- TO HELP ADDRESS THE HOUSING CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE LAST YEAR OUR GOVERNOR SIGNED AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR FOR EXAMPLE -- THE BAY AREA PART SYSTEM TO THINK ABOUT ITS LAND AND PRODUCING HOUSING ON TOP OF ITS LAND. IT IS IN NEED OF PLANNING DOLLARS IN THE WAY THAT OTHER -- COGS IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE IN NEED OF PLANNING DOLLARS MY HOPE IS THERE SOME FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF PLANNING A PRODUCTION GRANTS TO ASSIST AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THAT DISCUSSION BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID. I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN SKETCH OUT HERE WITH THE ASSEMBLY FRAMEWORK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THIS. THANK YOU THIS TIME WE'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT. ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- RELATIVE TO THE HOUSING PROPOSAL SEE SACK SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSAL TO ALLOCATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL GRANT FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTING CURRENT HOUSING PLANNING REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO SUPPORT FOCUSING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND RELATIVE TO THE HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL I WE WERE SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE FLEXIBILITY OF LAST YEAR'S HE PROGRAM OR THIS YEAR'S HE PROGRAM -- WE THINK THAT GIVING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT -- PROJECTS AND SERVICES LIKE CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO SUPPORT SERVICES AND RAPID RE HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WILL LEAD TO MAXIMUM SUCCESS -- WE ALSO SUPPORT COUNTY LED TO EFFORTS TO LOOK AT SYSTEM -- SYSTEM LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOMELESSNESS -- CRISIS -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ALLOCATE FUNDS THROUGH THE C. O. C. MODEL WE WOULD. LIKE TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND STAFF ON IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO THESE A CONTINUUM OF CARE MODEL THAT PROVIDE AN ACT VOTE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO FUNDS FOR THOSE SYSTEM LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS AND MORE COLLABORATION. AND LASTLY IN THE SPIRIT OF THE COLLABORATION -- WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY INCREASING PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CARVE OUTS AS WE THINK THAT THIS COLLABORATIVE PROCESS IS WHAT WILL LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES. AND ANALYST AT LASTLY BUT WE DO SUPPORT THE USE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNTS FOR ANY AS THE UNDERLYING DATA FOR ANY MATT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNADINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL HOMELESSNESS FUNDING -- LAST YEAR HEAP SPARKED THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS AND MULTI JURISDICTIONAL COLLABORATIONS WITHIN THE COUNTY. THAT HAVE BEEN HELPFUL DESPITE THE ONGOING NEEDS THE REGION HAS SEEN POSITIVE CHANGES AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS. SUCH AS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HOMELESS OUT REACH AN AGGRESSIVE USE OF HOUSING FIRST AND RAPID RE HOUSING PROTOCOLS. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO USE THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT ONE TO ENSURE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW THE DOLLARS ARE USED. AND WOULD SUPPORT INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF REWARDING JURISDICTIONS FOR INNOVATIVE OR CREATIVE PROJECTS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU. HI I'M DAVID SISTER WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA FOR PART OF MY COMMENTS ALSO BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OTHER CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PIECES -- PERSONAL WE APPRECIATE HAVING BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE SO FOCUSED ON HOUSING. THIS PROPOSAL OF COURSE INCLUDES SOME VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENTS INCLUDING AN EXPANSION OF TAX CREDITS. AND INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AT THE SAME TIME THIS PROPOSAL DOES NEED SOME REFINEMENT OF BOTH MORE EQUITABLY AND MORE DIRECTLY SERVE THOSE MOST IN NEED. EIGHT CITIES ON DATA SHOWS THAT OF THE SHORTFALL OF THREE AND A HALF MILLION HIGH RENTAL HOMES. 71% IS FOR VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHILE JUST 2% IS FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. YEAH THIS PROPOSAL DIVERT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TOWARDS PLANNING AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TOWARDS THE MIXED INCOME PROGRAM -- THE MIX INTO PROGRAM WHILE IMPORTANT DIVER -- IS A PILOT THAT HASN'T BEEN FULLY TESTED YET -- TOOK APPLICATIONS FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST RECENTLY AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAS NOT YET ALLOCATED FUNDS. THE ONLY PLACE WHERE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS GET DIRECT INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE BUDGET. IS THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PORTION OF THE TAX CREDIT EXPANSION. AND WHILE THESE ARE ALL SMART INVESTMENTS THEY'D THEY NEED TO BE MADE MORE EQUITABLY AND MORE PROPORTIONATE TO THE NEED -- MOREOVER WE NEED INVESTMENTS LIKE TAX CREDITS BE ON GOING INSTEAD OF ONE TIME TO TRULY ADDRESS THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. WHEN WE FAIL TO STIR FAMILIES OF THE LOWEST INCOMES WE ONLY GROW OUR POPULATION EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS? AND ON THAT NOTE HOUSING CALIFORNIANS USERS ARE EXCITED TO SEE CONTINUED INVESTMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE STRUCTURE PROPOSED HERE. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY CREATED THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM LAST YEAR IT WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. BASICALLY STOPPED OUT BEFORE FINDING MORE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS THIS CRISIS IN A MORE SUSTAINABLE AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH -- TO INTERVENTIONS PRUDENT TO DECREASE HOMELESSNESS. THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF STATED THAT SHELTERS ALL SLEEP. WELL HOUSING SERVICES SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN OTHER WORDS THE NUMBER ONE SOLUTION HOMELESSNESS IS A HOME IT'S ALSO THE EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTION. WE HOPE THAT AS YOU CONTINUE. TO TO DEVELOP A RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS THROUGH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE YOU'LL CONSIDER A MORE HOLISTIC LONG TERM APPROACH LIKE THE ONE PROPOSED. BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA IN AB EIGHT SIXTEEN WE NEED A BOTH AND STRATEGY KEEP IS ONE PART OF IT AND WE NEED REAL INVESTMENT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THAT ARE IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND WHAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE FUNDED BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER ON GOING FUNDING. SUCH AS AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER RACES PROPOSAL WHICH IS PERFORMED BEFORE YOU BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO SEE.

COULD ALSO BE USED FOR REGIONAL HOUSING TRES AND HELPING ARE LESS EFFICIENT. ART ARE LESS SMALLER CITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE NECESSARILY THE THE THE STAFFING CAPACITY TO HELP WITH AND IMPROVE THEIR LOCAL HOUSING POLICIES AND WE WOULD ALL HAVE LIKE THE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE TO PROVIDE THAT.

TWO LACKEY MISSOURIAN. CAN ONE DO ITEM NUMBER TWO OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HE LET'S HEAR FROM THE APARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. ON GINNY PARTY FOR THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNSEL WITH MEALS Là HELLO MATIX WHO HAS BEEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIAISON. FOR THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION AND SHE IS NOW THEY KEEP GRANT MANAGER. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT THE PROGRAM. OUR REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON WILL FOCUS ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF HEAP IMPLEMENTATION AND SOME EARLY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PROGRAM. I BELIEVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH A HIGH LEVEL HEAP TIMELINE. AS WELL AS A CHART THE PROVIDES MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS AND DISBURSEMENTS. I WILL TURN NOW TO HELP TO PROVIDE THE UPDATES ON HEAP IMPLEMENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MY NAME IS A HELL OF MATIX AND I A THAT HE'D GRANT MANAGER -- SO AS YOU KNOW THE HEAT -- PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO CITIES. COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. THE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ARE THE ELEVEN LARGEST CITIES IDENTIFIED WITH POPULATIONS OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND OR MORE AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE. THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED USING A FORMULA THAT IS BASED LARGELY ON THAT JURISDICTION'S CHAIR OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION. OF THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE. WHICH MAPPED OUT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AN ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES -- WAS ISSUED IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FOLLOWED BY THE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH -- AND THAT IN FACT ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH WE RECEIVED TWO APPLICATIONS FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND THE CITY OF OAKLAND -- WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED ALL FORTY THREE CONTINUES OF CARE AND ELEVEN LARGE CITY APPLICATIONS BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS REQUIRED IN STATUTE -- AND THIS IS REALLY GREAT NEWS BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT A SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING HALL FUNDING WAS APPLIED FOR IN ROUND. ONE I'M IN ADDITION YOU CAN SEE FROM THE HANDOUT THAT YOU HAVE -- THAT WE HAVE EXCEEDED AND MATT OUR TIME LINES IN THE STATUTE WE MET OUR INTERNAL GOAL OF AWARDING HEAT FUNDS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION. AND THEN WE WERE DISPERSED HE FUNDS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED STANDARD AGREEMENT. 41100% OF THESE GRANTS WE MET OUR COMMITMENT TO DISPERSE HEAT FUNDS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE DATE THE APPLICATION WAS TEAM TO COMPLETE. ALL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR HEAP HAVE BEEN DISPERSED AS OF APRIL THIRD -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AGAIN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT ALL OF THE DOLLARS OFFER HEAP ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- SO THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. WELL IT'S STILL EARLY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE STANDARD AGREEMENTS -- THE CITIES OF THE CEO SEES HAVE ALLOCATED FINDINGS FUNDING AND THE GENERAL CATEGORIES AND SERVICES ABOUT 38% OF THE HEAT FUNDS -- ARE ALLOCATED TO THAT CATEGORY 34% FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT. 13% FOR RENTAL ASSAULT ASSISTANCE OR SUBSIDIES ADMIN COSTS AND ABOUT 3% IN THE OTHER CATEGORY WITCHING CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE BATHROOMS HAND WASHING STATIONS -- SO NOW THAT THE HEAT FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED THE HEAP TEAM I HAS BEEN TURNING ITS ATTENTION TO PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEAT ARE WE DO A WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE TO THE CEO SEES IN THE LARGE CITIES -- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- A LAST WEEK ARE -- FOCUS ON AUTHENTIC YOUTH ENGAGEMENT BEGAN -- AND ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE CONNECTIONS TO EXPERTS AND MODEL PROGRAMS FOR ADDRESSING YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER SERVICES. THANK YOU HELLO. TURNING NOW TO LESSONS LEARNED FROM HEAT. IT'S CLEARLY EARLY DAYS FOR THE PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW LESSONS THAT I THINK OF CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM. AND OUR SUCCESS AND DISBURSING THE FUNDS SO QUICKLY. FIRST THE AUTHORIZING STATUTE WAS CLEAR AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE BUT WAS NOT TOO PRESCRIPTIVE IN THE MAJOR PROGRAM STRUCTURE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS AND USES AN ALLOCATION FORMULA PROVISIONS. IT ALLOWED US TO MOVE AHEAD QUICKLY AND AT THE SAME TIME GAVE US ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THE SPECIFIC DECISIONS THAT INEVITABLY ARISE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROGRAM. SECOND WE DELIBERATELY SET OUT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM IS SIMPLE TRANSPARENT AND STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE WITHIN I ALWAYS ON HOW WE COULD MAKE THINGS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WE TOOK THE FLEXIBILITY TO HEART WHILE ALSO WORKING HARD TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS WHY RECEIVED OUR FIRST APPLICATION AS WELL HELLO MENTIONED UP APPLICATIONS TO FROM OAKLAND AND SAN DIEGO ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE ISSUED THE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. AND WHY ALL THE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED IN ROUND. ONE THIRD WE TOOK PARTNERSHIP SERIOUSLY OF THE THREE POSITIONS AUTHORIZED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HEAP ONE IS LAW HELLAS POSITION THAT OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIAISON. WHOSE PRIMARY ROLE IS TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUUM'S OF CARE. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT IN IMPLEMENTING KEEP. DURING THE APPLICATION PERIOD THE HEAP TEAM SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING PRESENTATIONS AND WEBINARS ACROSS THE STATE HOLDING WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS AND ANSWERING EMAILS AND CALLS. THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION PERIOD THE TEAM ALSO PROVIDED ONE ON ONE SUPPORT AND DIRECTING GAUGE MEANT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. WHICH WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. LET HELL AS SHE MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO CONTINUES TO HOLD WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS IN WHICH ALL CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE CAN CALL IN TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC -- WITH BOTH THE STAFF AND THEIR PEERS. AND FINALLY WE KNOW THE WORK IS NOT OVER AS Là HELEN MENTIONED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE REAL SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM MEANING THE FUNDS ARE USED EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS WE ARE SHIFTING QUICKLY INTO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKING WITH GRANTEES TO ESTABLISH GOOD REPORTING PROCESS SEES. AND MONITORING PERFORMANCE OVER TIME. CONSISTENT WITH OUR OVERALL APPROACH WE WILL ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES WITH THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO PARTNERSHIP. FOCUSING ON HOW WE CAN ASSIST GRANTEES IN ACCOMPLISHING THEIR GOALS AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I WANTED TO TURN BRIEFLY TO THE QUESTION OF DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- FOCUSED ON RECENTLY IN THE KEEP IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE HEAP STATUTE REQUIRES THE CITIES AND CONTINUUM'S OF CARE TO SUBMIT TO ANNUAL REPORTS AND ONE FINAL REPORT. THE DUE DATES OF THESE REPORTS ARE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY STATUTE FOR THESE REPORTS IS CONTRACT EXPENDITURES. THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SERVED BY PROGRAM FUNDS AND PROGRESS TOWARD STATE AND LOCAL HOMELESS TO SCHOOLS. STATURE ALSO AUTHORIZED AGENCY TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO MEET REPORTING OR AUDIT REQUIREMENTS. IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM WE HAVE EXPANDED THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THE LANGUAGE IN STATUTE. AND ALL HE'D CONTRACTS SPECIFY THE GRANTEES MUST PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA WE GET IS WHAT WE NEED TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF HEAP ON HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT IT BEING OVERLY BURDENSOME ON JURISDICTIONS. MOST OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRES CURRENTLY COLLECTED IN THE LOCAL HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE ACTUAL REPORTING FORM THE GRANT RECIPIENTS WILL USE. BUT I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CATEGORIES THAT WE WILL BE COLLECTING DATA ON IN ADDITION TO CONTRACT EXPENDITURES WILL BE REQUESTING INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNTS AWARDED TO SUB GRANTEES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BY ACTIVITY IN PROGRAM TYPE SO FOR EXAMPLE RENTAL ASSISTANCE -- RAPID RE HOUSING OF ANOTHER KIND SHELTER BED STREET OUT REACH PERMANENT HOUSING. IN ADDITION TO THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SERVED WILL BE ASKING FOR THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF SERVICE PROVIDED. WILL ALSO BE ASKING FOR INCREASES IN CAPACITY FOR BOTH EXISTING AND NEW PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF ON SHELTERED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BECOMING SHELTERED AND THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ENTERING PERMANENT HOUSING. WE'LL ALSO BE ASKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH THE 5% HOMELESS YOUTH SET ASIDE. AND THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN KEEP FUNDING PRIORITIES AND HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. WE'LL BE POSSIBLE NGUYEN WHERE POSSIBLE WERE ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION -- BY SUBPOPULATION. WE BELIEVE THE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH PEOPLE PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF VALUABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM THE COUNCIL THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. HE PROGRESS REPORTS AND OTHER HEAP DATA COLLECTED WILL BE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY IN ON OUR WEBSITE BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE. NOTHING TO ADD WE JUST BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. LL. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. APPRECIATE -- HEY YOU'RE MENTIONING DATA AND AND METRICS AND A GLOBAL QUESTION I HAVE -- HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT AS A STATE IN AND CERTAINLY ALL THE JURISDICTIONS AROUND CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. WITHOUT A LOT OF METRICS OF WHAT IS REALLY WORKING AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU -- DO WE HAVE ANY BASELINE OF METRICS I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO COLLECT. DATA ON THE FIRST HALF BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE WE'RE GONNA SPEND HOPEFULLY ANOTHER AT LEAST HALF BILLION DOLLARS OR MAYBE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT METRICS YOU HAVE WHAT DATA WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND THEN WHAT DATA YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE CAPTURING SO THAT WE CAN? REALLY PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE TO LOCALS AND AND CEO SEES TO HELP US -- ADDRESSES BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE ALL WANT WE WE WERE. THERE'S A REAL GENEROSITY OF OF OF SPIRIT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO SPEND IN THE BUDGET BUT I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT. ABSOLUTELY THOSE THAT'S GREAT QUESTIONS -- SEE IF I CAN ADDRESS THEM ALL -- NO CURRENTLY WE ARE CHALLENGED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A STATE LEVEL BASELINE OF DATA ON HOMELESSNESS AS YOU KNOW -- BOTH IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS -- AND ALSO IN TERMS OF SERVICES THAT ARE USED IN ANY GAPS IN SERVICES -- THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED IS YOU KNOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE CONTINUES OF CARE. AND THAT DATA GETS TRANSMITTED UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNUALLY AND AND THEN HI -- THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT ISSUES -- A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REPORTS THAT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN NOT ONLY TO THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONTINUE WITH CARE LEVEL SO THAT DOES PROVIDE US WITH THE DATA THAT THAT FRANKLY WE'RE RELYING ONCURRENTLY IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION -- THE COUNCIL STAFF HAS BEEN IN AN IN AN EXPLORATORY PHASE OF LOOKING AT DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE LEVEL HOMELESS. INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US ACCESS -- TO TO THE DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- THAT AS I SAY IS IN SORT OF THE MARKET RESEARCH STAGE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- ON SORT OF THE DEVELOPING WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND I THINK ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS -- IT I AM FAMILIAR WITH THAT -- CIRCUMSTANCE IN LAST YEAR'S YOU KNOW I'D A BILL TO TRY HIM FOR THAT CONCEPT WHICH I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION POLICING CONCEPT SUPPORTED -- THREE OF US OUR COLLEAGUE IS MOVING THAT SAME BILL FOR THIS YEAR BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT IN THIS BUDGET. WE CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THIS BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING AT LEAST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE MONEY IS BEING USED FOR AND IT IS INCREDIBLY IRONIC THAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SENDING THAT DATA TO THE FEDS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO RECTIFY THAT SO. MUCH HOPE -- IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO ANYONE IS LISTENING THAT WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT THIS YEAR WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE. AS FAR AS THE OF THESE GIRLS AND THEY REACHED OUT QUITE A BIT FOR HELP. ABSOLUTELY HELLO CAN SPEAK TO THAT -- IN MUCH MORE DETAIL BUT IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ON GOING -- WE HAVE THE OFFICE HOURS EVERY WEEK WHICH THE MAJORITY OF THEM PARTICIPATE IN -- THEY'VE REQUESTED YOU KNOW ONE ON ONE IN PERSON SO I'VE ATTENDED MEETINGS WORKSHOPS I'VE MET WITH CITY MANAGERS -- BAY AREA CO SEES TO HELP. YOU KNOW TO HELP THEM WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND THEN WITH YOU KNOW ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION SO THEY'RE VERY VERY ENGAGED. IN ONE BENEFIT IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE NEED ACCESS TO INFORMATION -- FROM THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED WE GET A VERY GOOD RESPONSE RATE WHICH IS REALLY% HELPFUL TO US IN TRYING TO GET AN EARLY SENSE OF HOW IMPLEMENTATION IS IS GOING. SO I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DATA YOU CLICK TO FOR THE HEAT PROGRAM -- I WISH A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS WOULD DO THAT. WE'RE PUTTING MONEY TOWARDS IT BUT WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE -- IN THE MONEY WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN ANALYZE THAT DATA. AND COME OUT WITH SOMETHING GOOD BY ONE OF THE HE WAS PRETTY FOOT SENIOR STAFFER BEING ENGAGE WITH OUR STAFF. BECAUSE BOTH OF THE GREAT JOB -- THIS POINT OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

FORD AND I'LL JUST SAY THIS -- WITHOUT -- THIS IS NOT A SHOOT THE MESSENGER MOMENT BUT I THINK WITH. WITH THE EXCEPTION THE DMV I GET MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FAILURE OPERATIONS AT THE A. B. C. THAN VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY I CAN THINK OF AND I HAVE BEEN AWARE THAT I THINK THE LACK OF RESOURCES IS REALLY IMPINGED YOUR ABILITY TO DO THAT -- BUT CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE CHALLENGES THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE HAVING IN ACCESSING. SERVICES FROM THE ABC -- THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ONLINE SERVICES THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ALL THAT BEING SAID I'M VERY OPEN TO SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL BUT I WILL WANT TO KNOW MOVING FORWARD THAT IF THESE RESOURCES ARE COMING DOWN -- THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE A REAL CHANGE AND HOW ARE CONSTITUENTS -- PARTICULARLY OUR SMALL BUSINESS CONSTITUENTS ARE ARE DRESSED SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AND DID WANT YOU TO BE SURPRISED IF IN THE YEAR TWO I'M STILL THIS COMMITTEE AND IF WE KEEP GETTING THESE COMPLAINTS WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS. OPEN UP PUBLIC COMMENT. CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. IN THE PAST A. B. C. DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND ENFORCEMENT STAFF TO CARRY OUT THIS MISSION. CHANGES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE IMPROVE THE HIRING AND RETENTION OF ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. THIS REQUEST MAKES OTHER CHANGES TO FURTHER INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. IMPROVE LACKS LICENSEE PROCESSES IN THE OPERATIONS OF ABC ELIMINATE THE OPERATING DEFICIT FRIDAY GREATER LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THESE CHANGES ARE FOR GOVERNOR THE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ABC. SUBCOMMITTEE WHAT TO ASSESS THE IMPACT IS THE CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE OVER TIME. AND WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING TO THE TRAILER BILL REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES REPORTING OF PERFORMANCE METRICS IN TWO YEARS AND AGAIN A FIVE YEARS. WELL AS A LOT OF OPEN THANK YOU. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR LAST ON A MISSION -- FOR FIFTEEN BUSINESS MODERNIZATION RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THE DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO MODERNIZE ITS EXTERNAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO BETTER SERVE THE PUBLIC IN ITS INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. THERE INITIALLY TO STE DISTINCT PROJECTS INVOLVE THE SERVICES AND RBS RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE SERVICE -- THESE TWO HAVE BEEN COMBINED GIVEN COMMON STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS RESULTING COST SAVINGS AND RISK REDUCTION. THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING FIVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ODD TO FUND THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROJECT. AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK FOR MORE SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEARS ONCE WE HAVE OUR PROCUREMENT -- COMPLETED AND BETTER ESTIMATES IS THE FOR THOSE COSTS. THANK YOU LL. I WE DID HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS AND QUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT HASN'T YET COMPLETED THE FULL POWER PROCESS THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS WHICH IS THE NEW I. T. U.. R. PROCESS THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED A FEW YEARS AGO SO IT'S JUST COMPLETED STAGE TWO OUT OF FOUR STAGES -- ACCORDINGLY I THE PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE A REFINED COST ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT -- WE THINK THAT THIS MEANS THAT REALLY THE LEGISLATURE -- HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING THE FULL COST OF THE PROJECT AT THIS POINT AND SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CONDITION THIS FUNDING ON THE COMPLETION OF THAT FULL PROBLEM HELP PROCESS -- SECONDLY JUST WANTED TO FIGHT FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT -- RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE COMPONENT -- SERVER COMPONENT -- ORIGINALLY WHEN THAT WENT THROUGH THAT WAS -- IN RESPONSE TO A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN THE ORIGINAL COST ESTIMATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SO JUST WANTED TO FIGHT THAT FOR FOLKS -- I CERTAINLY IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO HAVE THIS IT COMPONENT BUT BUT IT WASN'T ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED WHEN THE BILL WENT THROUGH. THANK YOU FINANCE. I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT FINANCE ASSESSES EACH PROJECT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AS A PART TIME AND IF BUDGET BILLS OF LANGUAGES NECESSARY WELL PROJECT IS STILL IN THE POWER PROCESS. AND PART OF THE INTENT OF THE POP PROCESSES THAT ESTIMATIONS OF PROJECT COST AND SCHEDULE APPROVED DURING STAGE TWO ARE FAIRLY ACCURATE. AND POLICY IN THE STATE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT MANUAL ESTABLISH A THRESHOLD DURING STAGE FORM THAT I PROJECT CANNOT MOVE FORWARD OR COSTS AND ARE NOT WITHIN 20% OR FIVE MILLION WHICHEVER IS LESS OF STAGE TWO ESTIMATES. SO IN THIS CASE -- DO THE WORK COMPLETED BY ABC DURING THE MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PHASES. IN MINISTRATION FELT THAT ONE YOU'RE FUNDING -- IS APPROPRIATE TO AVOID POTENTIAL DELAYS. AND BASED ON ABC'S RESEARCH ON CURRENT TRES TRENDS IN THE RBS TRAINING MARKET -- WE THOUGHT THAT ESTIMATES IN THE STAGE TO DOCUMENTATION ARE REASONABLE. AND ONCE A. B. C. COMPLETE STAGE FOR IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN ABC CAN REQUEST FUNDING FOR SUBSTANCE QUITE YEARS THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF FINAL COST WHEN THE PROJECT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU A QUESTION FIRST MISTER APPLE SMITH -- HOW YOU SURE THE TRAINING FEE CHARGE OF SERVERS IS NOT EXCESSIVE? SO THE TRAINING FEE THEY WERE CHARGING THE SERVICES NOTHING OTHER THAN A COST RECOVERY -- IT'S JUST BUDGETED DIRECTLY TOWARDS OUR COST OF ADMINISTERING THE EXAM SO ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY RECOVERING IS USED -- THE MONEY FOR THE FEES IS USE IN FACT FOR THAT PROGRAM IT WILL THAT BE -- RIGHT NOW OUR ESTIMATE IS ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS -- THE VARIABLES FOR US WOULD BE OF COURSE THE COST PROCUREMENT ALSO THE SIZE OF THE POOL OF THE APPLICANTS BUT THREE TWENTY FIVE IS OUR IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE AS OF THIS DAY. OKAY THANK YOU THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB TWELVE TWENTY ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT. TO ENSURE SERVERS ARE KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT THE STATE LAW AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL IN THE BODY. THE SUBCOMMITTEES WE WANT TO ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT FEES CHARGED TO SERVERS. THE GOAL OF THE TRAINING OR NOT EXCESSIVE. THE WHOLE SIDE OPEN. THESE ARE HEARING THANK YOU CAN YOU
