ONE QUARTER THE TOTAL FUNDING

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:29.274 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED IN S. B. FIVE. IN

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:30.576 region:rollup2

THIRTY DIFFERENT BUDGET

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:36.315 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AND THOSE ARE

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:39.818 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZED ON PAGES TWO THROUGH

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:41.019 region:rollup2
FOUR OF YOUR COMMITTEE AGENDA.

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:42.354 region:rollup2
I THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:44.623 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT IF FOR

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:47.226 region:rollup2
LOCAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT FOR

00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:48.026 region:rollup2
GRANT PRIMARILY TO NONPROFITS

00:28:47.226 --> 00:28:49.561 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:50.829 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT DIFFERENT PROJECTS.

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.698 region:rollup2
AND MORE THAN HALF OF THAT LOCAL

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:54.566 region:rollup2
ASSIST IN FINDING IS FOR LOCAL

00:28:52.698 --> 00:28:55.767 region:rollup2
PARKS PROJECTS.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.236 region:rollup2
OTHERS ALSO INCLUDED IN THEIR

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:58.270 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILLION

00:28:57.236 --> 00:28:59.972 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN STATE CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.240 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT INCLUDES NINETY

00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:03.609 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION FOR FLOOD

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.143 region:rollup2
PROTECTION PROJECTS. IN TWENTY

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:07.012 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION FOR THE SOLVENCY

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:08.246 region:rollup2
RESTORATION WORK.

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:09.414 region:rollup2
IN LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:11.617 region:rollup2
FUNDING PROPOSED FOR STATE

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:14.286 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS ENOUGH MOSTLY TO

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:16.388 region:rollup2
EITHER DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:18.423 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT GRANT GUIDELINES.

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:18.991 region:rollup2
OR TO DO OTHER SORT OF GRANT

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:20.158 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT

00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:22.494 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:23.762 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT A SHORT OVERVIEW

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:26.031 region:rollup2
OUR OFFICE DID HAVE FOUR

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:27.633 region:rollup2
COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE AND

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:29.301 region:rollup2
REVIEWING THE THE PLAN.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:30.669 region:rollup2
FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT WE THINK

00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.271 region:rollup2
OVERALL THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:33.939 region:rollup2
PLAN IS VERY REASONABLE AND ITS

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:35.307 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO WHAT IT PROPOSES

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:37.376 region:rollup2
DEFINED IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:38.243 region:rollup2
WE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:29:37.376 --> 00:29:40.445 region:rollup2
AND TARGETS

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:41.713 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT FUNDING AT PROGRAMS

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:43.882 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN REASONABLY BE

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:45.617 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO GET FINDING OUT FOR

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:47.586 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IN

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:48.820 region:rollup2
MOST CASES THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE

00:29:47.586 --> 00:29:50.689 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON THE ALREADY EXISTING

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.891 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE RECENTLY ACTIVE

00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:54.192 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO. UPDATING GUIDELINES

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:55.861 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:57.295 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS AND CAN

00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:59.164 region:rollup2
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED BE DONE

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.831 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND AND

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:02.434 region:rollup2
GRANTS AWARDED BEFORE THE END OF

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:04.336 region:rollup2
THE YEAR. AND FOR NEW PROGRAMS

00:30:02.434 --> 00:30:06.171 region:rollup2
AT THE MINISTRATION IS TYPICALLY

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:07.873 region:rollup2
ONLY REQUESTING FUNDING FOR THE

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:09.675 region:rollup2
FATE OPERATIONS SO THAT WOULD BE

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:11.076 region:rollup2
THE PERSONNEL THAT'S VERY TO

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:12.778 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THOSE GUIDELINES FOR NEW

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:14.212 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. KNOWING THAT AWARD

00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:16.081 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WOULD HAPPEN UNTIL

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:17.282 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENT YEARS AND WE THINK

00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:18.784 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:20.619 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION IS

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:22.788 region:rollup2
HAVE GENERALLY FOCUSED ITS.

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:24.056 region:rollup2
FUNDING ON PROGRAMS WHERE

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:26.224 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT EXISTING.

00:30:24.056 --> 00:30:28.760 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BOND

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:29.628 region:rollup2
FUNDING AVAILABLE AND SO.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.729 region:rollup2
AND AND WE THINK THAT'S A

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:32.264 region:rollup2
REASONABLE APPROACH IS OVERALL

00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:33.298 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE PRO

00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:34.833 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS.

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:36.935 region:rollup2
WITH A COUPLE MINOR.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:38.570 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WOULD RECOMMEND

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:41.373 region:rollup2
WHICH I MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.074 region:rollup2
ANEST ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT FD

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
FIVE DON'T PASSED IN JUNE.

00:30:42.074 --> 00:30:44.776 region:rollup2
SO THOSE COUPLE OF CHANGES WERE

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.344 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING WE THINK THE RATHER

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:48.947 region:rollup2
MODEST BUT. THE FIRST OF WHICH

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:50.115 region:rollup2
IS TO SCHEDULE HOW THE PROJECT

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:51.750 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE FINE DID.

00:30:50.115 --> 00:30:53.418 region:rollup2
WITHIN NINETY FOUR MILLION FOR

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.353 region:rollup2
FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT.

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:56.555 region:rollup2
IF YOU CERTAINLY KNOW THEIR

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.789 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:58.490 region:rollup2
FLOOD PROTECTION PROJECT

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:01.326 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.361 region:rollup2
IN IN NEED ACROSS THE STATE. V.

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:04.062 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL DOESN'T

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.931 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WHICH SPECIFIC PROJECTS

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:07.332 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FUNDED WITH THIS NINETY

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:09.568 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION BUT WE THINK THERE

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:10.702 region:rollup2
COUPLE ADVANTAGES OF SCHEDULING

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:12.003 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN THE BUDGET ACT. OWE IT

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:13.672 region:rollup2
WE WOULD TYPICALLY DO FROM US

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:15.674 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THE

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:16.942 region:rollup2
FIRST DAY IS OF COURSE TO ENSURE

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:18.410 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROJECT HAD A

00:31:16.942 --> 00:31:19.845 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE ARE CONSISTENT WITH

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.047 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S

00:31:19.845 --> 00:31:23.582 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES. AND SECONDLY WE

00:31:22.047 --> 00:31:25.650 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD THAT ALLOW FOR

00:31:23.582 --> 00:31:28.153 region:rollup2
SOME ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.654 region:rollup2
THAT IF IF PROJECTS IDENTIFIED.

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:32.624 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE A NEED TO CHANGE

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:33.959 region:rollup2
EITHER IN SCOPE OR IN COST IF

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:34.760 region:rollup2
THE COST INCREASE.

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.361 region:rollup2
THE IMITATION BE REQUIRED TO

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.963 region:rollup2
COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:39.264 region:rollup2
NOTIFY YOU OF THOSE CHANGES THAT

00:31:37.963 --> 00:31:40.465 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT CAL

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:41.433 region:rollup2
AND ABILITY MEASURE.

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:43.201 region:rollup2
THEIR SECOND CHANGE WOULD

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:44.569 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND IS THERE'S ABOUT

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:46.171 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:48.206 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:31:46.171 --> 00:31:49.474 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT IF FOR

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:51.109 region:rollup2
VARIOUS HABITAT RESTORATION

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:52.244 region:rollup2
PROJECT. WE KNOW HOWEVER THERE

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.879 region:rollup2
IS OVER HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION

00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:55.547 region:rollup2
DOLLARS CURRENTLY UNCOMMITTED

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:57.315 region:rollup2
FROM PROPOSITION ONE FOR SIMILAR

00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:59.351 region:rollup2
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. AND WE

00:31:57.315 --> 00:32:00.285 region:rollup2
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO US WHAT

00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.887 region:rollup2
THAT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:03.355 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNED

00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:04.556 region:rollup2
WITH THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED.

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:06.158 region:rollup2
BUT TO FIND THAT OUT OF

00:32:04.556 --> 00:32:07.893 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE OUT OF THAT

00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:10.162 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN S. B. FIVE. IDEA

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:12.364 region:rollup2
BEING THERE THAT THE.

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:14.466 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED TO

00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:17.335 region:rollup2
RUN PARALLEL BOND ADMINISTRATION

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:19.070 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES.

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:20.906 region:rollup2
UP TO OTHER COMMENTS WE HAD THE

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.807 region:rollup2

THE FEAR ON THEIR LONGER TERM

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:28.280 region:rollup2
SPENDING PLAN. WE KNOW THAT THE

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.714 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ONLY PURPOSE

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.017 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES A SPENDING PLAN FOR

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:33.985 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. CLEARLY THAT

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:36.555 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:38.323 region:rollup2
OTHER ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:40.058 region:rollup2

WOULD COULD BENEFIT FROM

00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:47.899 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT HOW LONG THE

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:50.836 region:rollup2
MINISTRATION BELIEVE IT WILL

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:51.736 region:rollup2
TAKE TO GET THOSE OTHER DOLLARS.

00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:52.337 region:rollup2
.

PROJECTS IMPLEMENTED.

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:55.340 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY WE THINK YOU SHOULD

00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:57.843 region:rollup2
USE THE A SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.344 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER. ALTERNATIVES SHOULD

00:32:57.843 --> 00:33:01.780 region:rollup2

PROPOSED IN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:21.766 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT PROBABLY A HIGH ENOUGH

00:33:20.432 --> 00:33:23.768 region:rollup2
PRIORITY YOU WOULD WANT TO FIND

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:24.736 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR EVEN IN THE

REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:34.479 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING BUT THERE COULD BE

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.847 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMMATIC PRIORITY IF

IDENTIFY TO USE.

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:44.089 region:rollup2

00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:46.024 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING FROM GENERAL FUND TO.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:31.114 region:rollup2
FIRST WE WERE TO GET THE BAND

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:32.882 region:rollup2
BACK TOGETHER.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:35.518 region:rollup2
SO WE RECONVENE THE STAKEHOLDER

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:36.953 region:rollup2
VISION PROCESS GROUP.

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:38.154 region:rollup2
THE SECOND MOST RECENT STRUCTURE

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.456 region:rollup2
WAS TO GIVE YOU A PROGRESS

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:40.557 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:42.058 region:rollup2
BENCHMARKED AGAINST THE TWO

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:43.827 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TEN TWENTY EIGHT

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:45.128 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:46.997 region:rollup2
WE SUBMITTED THAT IN OCTOBER OF

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:48.632 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:50.033 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD INSTRUCTION WAS TO

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:51.701 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HIGHER THE DEPARTMENT

01:02:50.033 --> 01:02:53.737 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE AND ENGAGE IN A

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:54.804 region:rollup2
MISSION BASED BUDGETING PROCESS.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:56.139 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THAT PROCESS

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.741 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY.

01:02:56.139 --> 01:03:01.011 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY SHAPED THE PROPOSAL

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:02.679 region:rollup2
FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.813 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A WHOLE HECK

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:05.315 region:rollup2
OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT.

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:07.183 region:rollup2
IT'S

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:08.818 region:rollup2
RARE.

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:11.321 region:rollup2
THAT THE DEPARTMENTS FAR LEFT

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:14.391 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCY AND FAR RIGHT

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:15.792 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCY. WILL ALIGN.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:18.361 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:19.929 region:rollup2
WAS NONPARTISAN.

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.698 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT CONVERSATION WAS

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.199 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:24.768 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU SEE A DIVERSITY

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:26.403 region:rollup2
OF GROUPS IS SUPPORT THIS FIFTY

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:28.705 region:rollup2
POINT SIX MILLION.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:30.006 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT WE DO WITH IT.

01:03:28.705 --> 01:03:31.641 region:rollup2
WE TAKE NINETEEN POINT SIX

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:34.511 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:36.646 region:rollup2
AND WE'D FIX THE IMBALANCE

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:38.548 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT REALLY COMES DO.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:41.017 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO AVOID

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:42.385 region:rollup2
CUTTING CRITICAL WORK.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:44.187 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE ABOUT THIRTY ONE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:46.856 region:rollup2
MILLION. AND WE ENHANCE OUR

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:48.758 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION EFFORTS.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:51.094 region:rollup2
ATTACHED OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AN

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:51.995 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE CONCEPT TO INVEST IN

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:54.030 region:rollup2
NATURAL HERITAGE FOR ALL

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.399 region:rollup2
IT WAS DESIGNED BY THOSE

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:59.069 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:03:56.399 --> 01:04:00.770 region:rollup2
IT'S GOT FOUR ASPECTS.

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:02.672 region:rollup2
THIS FIFTY MILLION WILL HELP US

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.206 region:rollup2
ENHANCE CONSERVATION.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:05.208 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BENEFIT ALL

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:06.576 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.411 region:rollup2
IT WILL BENEFIT HUNTERS AND

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:09.145 region:rollup2
ANGLERS IF YOU'RE CALIFORNIAN

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:11.147 region:rollup2
YOU LIKE THOSE RECREATIONAL

01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:13.316 region:rollup2
PURSUITS.

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:14.851 region:rollup2
WE WILL INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:17.287 region:rollup2
RECRUIT RETAIN REACTIVATE

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.521 region:rollup2
HUNTERS AND ANGLERS.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:20.390 region:rollup2
WILL INVEST IN OUR HATCHERY

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:21.925 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.426 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS WILL

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:25.395 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE RISK

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:27.764 region:rollup2
THAT I'M FORCED TO RAISE THE

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:29.632 region:rollup2
FEES AGAIN ON HUNTERS AND

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:32.736 region:rollup2
ANGLERS IN THE STATE.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:34.504 region:rollup2
FOURTH BENEFIT YOUR CALIFORNIAN.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:36.106 region:rollup2
THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:38.041 region:rollup2
HELP US GET MORE CALIFORNIANS

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:39.109 region:rollup2
OUTDOORS INCLUDING.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.110 region:rollup2
INTRODUCING OURSELVES TO STE

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:42.412 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS WE TYPICALLY HAVE A

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.713 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT.

01:04:42.412 --> 01:04:46.783 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE DISADVANTAGED

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:48.818 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN OUR URBAN CORES.

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:50.620 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY THIS PROGRAM AND

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:52.088 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WILL HELP US PROVIDE

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.290 region:rollup2
STABILITY IN SERVICES.

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:58.361 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:59.362 region:rollup2
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:01.164 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:02.232 region:rollup2
TWO PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAT ARE

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:03.967 region:rollup2
PROTECTED UNDER STATE LAW IN THE

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.068 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:07.270 region:rollup2
MOST OF THOSE ARE FOUND ON

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:09.439 region:rollup2
PRIVATE LANDS.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:13.009 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:14.944 region:rollup2
US TO BUILD SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:16.446 region:rollup2
PRIVATE LANDS COLLABORATION.

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:18.982 region:rollup2
AND REGULATORY PROTECTION FOR

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:20.750 region:rollup2
THOSE LANDOWNERS IN WATER USERS

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:22.318 region:rollup2
WHO WANT TO DO GOOD CONSERVATION

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.387 region:rollup2
BUT NOT REMAIN EXPOSED UNDER

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:25.989 region:rollup2
STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES LAW.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:29.125 region:rollup2
SO.

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:29.692 region:rollup2
I THINK IN A MOMENT AND LATER

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.661 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT HEAR ABOUT A NEXUS

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:34.664 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:37.200 region:rollup2
NEXUS MEANS A CONNECTION.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:38.568 region:rollup2
BETWEEN SOURCE AND EXPENDITURE.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.236 region:rollup2
I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE UC

TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ESTIMATES.

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:46.743 region:rollup2

WILDLIFE VEHICLE CONFLICT IN THE

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:49.913 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:52.148 region:rollup2
IS AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:54.083 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:55.351 region:rollup2
AND THAT AS A CONSERVATIVE

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.820 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE THERE ABOUT SEVEN

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:58.822 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WILDLIFE VEHICLE

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.424 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:04.227 region:rollup2
PER YEAR ACROSS THE STATE.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:05.461 region:rollup2

CONTACTS

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.904 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH CITIZENS

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.339 region:rollup2
OFTEN THOSE CITIZENS ARE IN

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.308 region:rollup2
CARS.

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:19.609 region:rollup2
AND ON ROADS.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.578 region:rollup2
AND JUSTIN TWO THOUSAND

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:22.412 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. THEY ISSUE TWELVE

THOUSAND VEHICLE CALLED

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:25.281 region:rollup2
CITATIONS.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:27.083 region:rollup2
WHY IS THIS INFORMATION

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.485 region:rollup2
RELEVANT?

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:30.687 region:rollup2
TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THIS

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:32.622 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL OUR TO EMPLOY THE MOTOR

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:34.791 region:rollup2
VEHICLE ACCOUNT.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:36.092 region:rollup2
AND A TIRE RECYCLING FUND.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:37.760 region:rollup2
TO GENERATE THE FIFTY POINT SIX

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:40.763 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.698 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.732 region:rollup2
IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S BEEN

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:45.635 region:rollup2
AROUND LONGER THAN I'VE BEEN

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:47.103 region:rollup2
ALIVE.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:49.105 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AGREES IT'S A PROBLEM

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:51.508 region:rollup2
STABLE FUNDING.

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:53.710 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SUBMIT HOW WE CHOOSE

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:57.046 region:rollup2
TO MAKE BUDGET PRIORITIES.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:58.314 region:rollup2
IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR VALUES.

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.616 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MORE ANIMALS AND PLANTS

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:03.052 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE THAN ANY STATE IN

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:04.554 region:rollup2
THE UNION.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:06.723 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE OF TWENTY FIVE.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:09.559 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY HOT SPOTS

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:10.627 region:rollup2

DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL MYLES

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:13.830 region:rollup2
MISSION IS TO STEWARD THAT

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:15.465 region:rollup2
RESOURCE.

AND EVERYONE AGREES WE LACKS

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:17.734 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO DO THAT

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:19.936 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:22.338 region:rollup2
I'LL STOP THERE.

ALTHOUGH WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT'S

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.548 region:rollup2
TEMPTING TO START DIVING

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.550 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT INTO THE FUNDING

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.684 region:rollup2
SOURCES THAT ARE PROPOSED AND

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.485 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:37.220 region:rollup2
REASONABLE OR NOT WE WOULD

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:38.555 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RECOMMEND. THAT YOU

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.690 region:rollup2
BEGIN WITH WHAT YOU WANT THE

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:43.293 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO DO WHAT TASKS DO

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:44.694 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED TO DO THEN. TURN TO

DOLLAR GAP THAT THE DIRECTOR.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.469 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT STRUCTURAL

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.605 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:57.373 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING ACTIVITIES OF THE

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.841 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS UNDERTAKING AND

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.543 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM KEEP

COMING BEFORE YOU AS IT HAS FOR

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.147 region:rollup2
FOR RECENT YEARS.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:05.682 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO A STRONG CASE FOR

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.950 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL OF AUGMENTATION FOR

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:08.351 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT WE AGREE WITH

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.652 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULARLY GIVEN.

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:11.020 region:rollup2

POPULATION IN THE STATE.

01:08:13.056 --> 01:08:15.391 region:rollup2
THAT PACKAGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.726 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUT BEFORE

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.494 region:rollup2
YOU WE THINK IS A REASONABLE

01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:19.329 region:rollup2
STARTING PLACE IN PARTICULAR

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:21.331 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:08:19.329 --> 01:08:22.565 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON. PROTECTING US AND

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:24.233 region:rollup2
ASSISTING THE STATE'S ENDANGERED

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:26.002 region:rollup2
SPECIES BUT YOU MAY HAVE OTHER

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:26.936 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES FOR A PACKAGE THAT

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:28.371 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER FOR THE

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:29.872 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:31.240 region:rollup2
SO ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT IT

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.542 region:rollup2
IS YOU WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO DO

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.844 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH TIME AND THAT WILL

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:37.213 region:rollup2
COSTA THEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:38.815 region:rollup2
TURN TO WHAT FUNDING SOURCES SO

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:39.782 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED THERE THREE

01:08:38.815 --> 01:08:41.651 region:rollup2
SOURCES PROPOSED BY THE

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:42.919 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:44.320 region:rollup2
FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT

01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:45.622 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX MILLION FROM A TIRE

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.023 region:rollup2
RECYCLING MANAGEMENT FUND AND

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.424 region:rollup2
THEN SEVEN MILLION FROM THE

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:49.659 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.827 region:rollup2
SO STARTING WITH THE NBA THE

01:08:49.659 --> 01:08:52.428 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WE THINK

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:53.796 region:rollup2
THIS IS REASONABLE AND CONCEPT

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:55.498 region:rollup2
TO USE THIS FUNDING SOURCE THE

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:57.066 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION DOES SAY THAT IT

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:58.701 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED FOR MITIGATION OF

01:08:57.066 --> 01:09:01.371 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:02.739 region:rollup2
OF OF MOTOR VEHICLES I THINK

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:04.107 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE

01:09:02.739 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T YET SEEN.

01:09:04.107 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
AND ACCOUNTING OUR

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.611 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FOR HOW MUCH WOULD BE

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.680 region:rollup2
REASONABLE HOW MUCH OF THEIR

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:12.181 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD IS ACTUALLY A RESULT OF

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.516 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLES WE THINK THAT'S

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.518 region:rollup2
pIMPORTANT BOTH FROM A LEGAL

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:16.786 region:rollup2
BASIS AND A POLICY BASIS FOR

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:18.554 region:rollup2
USING THAT FUNDING SOURCE. SO

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:20.256 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THAT BUT

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:21.858 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THAT THAT FUNDING

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:23.559 region:rollup2
SOURCE COULD BE REASONABLE AND.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:24.060 region:rollup2
THE MODEST AMOUNT THAT IS

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:26.496 region:rollup2
PROPOSED THAT FUND COULD

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:28.431 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.966 region:rollup2
WHEN. A WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE

01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:32.235 region:rollup2
STILL WAITING FOR THAT THAT IN

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:34.537 region:rollup2
FIRST THAT YOU EXPECT TO RECEIVE

01:09:32.235 --> 01:09:35.171 region:rollup2
IT AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT HAVE

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.439 region:rollup2
INDICATED THEY'RE WORKING ON IT

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.306 region:rollup2
YES.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.175 region:rollup2
AND THAT WINNER THEN THE NEED

01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:40.543 region:rollup2
FOR KIND OF A TIMELINE. ARE WE

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:42.412 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:44.013 region:rollup2
MORE THAN DAYS LESS THAN YOU

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:46.549 region:rollup2
KNOW WEAKER SO WHERE WORKING ON.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:47.116 region:rollup2
THAT WORK LOAD JUSTIFICATION

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.017 region:rollup2
GREAT THE CLOSE ENOUGH THANK

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:50.353 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:52.488 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE TIRE FUND HOWEVER WE

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:53.122 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY JUSTIFICATION

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.457 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THE INITIAL

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.024 region:rollup2
INFORMATION DEPARTMENTS PROVIDED

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:56.225 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THAT NEXUS THIS IS

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.894 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:09:56.225 --> 01:10:00.063 region:rollup2
THERE WAS APPROVED AS A TWO

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:02.365 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE IT IT IS A FEE IT'S

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:04.967 region:rollup2
CALLED A FEE IN THE LEGISLATION.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:07.103 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:09.539 region:rollup2
VETERANS OF JUSTIFICATION THAT

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:11.507 region:rollup2
WOULD LINK THEY USE I HAVE A FEE

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.975 region:rollup2
ON TIRES FOR WORKLOAD FOR THE

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:13.676 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. AGAIN NAME THEY MAY

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.677 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.978 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BUT BASED ON WHAT WE

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:17.246 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN INITIALLY WE HAVEN'T

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.381 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT NEXUS.

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.482 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THIS FUND IS

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.250 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED THIS PORTION OF THE

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:22.418 region:rollup2
FUN THAT THAT IS PROPOSED TO BE

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.586 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED TO THE PARCHMENT IS

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:25.421 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED TO SUNSET AND TWENTY

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:27.190 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR. AND SO WE HAVE

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:28.891 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT EXPANDING NEW

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:29.325 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS UNDER

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.494 region:rollup2
THE.

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:33.029 region:rollup2
HEADER OF A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

01:10:31.494 --> 01:10:35.398 region:rollup2
SOURCE WHEN THE FUND IS.

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:36.999 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO SUNSET AND THEN THE

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:39.268 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WOULD FACE ANOTHER

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:40.536 region:rollup2
TIME SIMILAR. ONGOING PROBLEM IN

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:42.505 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:44.240 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF AB ONE COMPONENT OF

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:45.942 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO AS WELL AS I THINK WAS

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.211 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IS THAT THIS THIS TIRE

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:49.278 region:rollup2
FUND IS CURRENTLY. TIME USED BY

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:50.346 region:rollup2
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS A

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.714 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROPOSAL TO RE

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:53.049 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.517 region:rollup2
FISH AND WILDLIFE WOULD REQUIRE

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.119 region:rollup2
OR IS BEING PROPOSED TO USE OF

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:57.587 region:rollup2
BACKFILL. COME FROM THE

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:58.721 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.356 region:rollup2
FOR THE AIR BE THAT MAKE THEM

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:01.858 region:rollup2
HOLD SO WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:03.926 region:rollup2
HAS A LOT OF OTHER PRIORITIES

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.894 region:rollup2
FOR THE DDR FUNDING SO.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:07.096 region:rollup2
.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.930 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT DID THIS WOULD REDUCE

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.465 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR OTHER

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.200 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AND WHAT ABOUT THE

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:13.503 region:rollup2
MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT TO FUNDING

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.537 region:rollup2
DOES THAT CONSTITUTE DIVERSION

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:16.072 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE BACK

01:11:14.537 --> 01:11:17.173 region:rollup2
FILLED THEM NO THERE'S A FOR

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:18.508 region:rollup2
WELL. THAT THINK YOU PROBABLY

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.243 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM SOME PUBLIC COMMENT

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:21.811 region:rollup2
THERE IS FUNDING IN THAT I'M

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:23.379 region:rollup2
FUND BALANCE FOR THAT THAT COULD

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.247 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SO THERE'S NO DIRECT

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.782 region:rollup2
BACKFILL.

01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:27.950 region:rollup2
BUT THAT FUND IS LARGE AND

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:29.118 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS MANY OTHER ACTIVITIES

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.052 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE DEGREE YOU'RE

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
USING IT HERE YOU DON'T HAVE IT

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:33.256 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:35.224 region:rollup2
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT TIME. THAT

01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:36.893 region:rollup2
IT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THERE'S NO

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:39.028 region:rollup2
DIRECTORY DIRECTION BACK FILL AS

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:39.462 region:rollup2
THERE IS WITH THE TIRE FUND IN

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.330 region:rollup2
THIS CASE HOWEVER.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:43.699 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULDN'T AT THIS POINT

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:45.802 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND REJECTING THE USE OF.

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.969 region:rollup2
OF THE TIRE FUND BECAUSE OF ALL

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.204 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CONCERNS THAT I

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.572 region:rollup2
OUTLINES NO NEXUS

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:51.474 region:rollup2
BOB THE SUNSET AND THE REQUIRED

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:53.376 region:rollup2
TO BACK FILL.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:55.778 region:rollup2
SO THAT LEAVES YOU WITH. GENERAL

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:57.180 region:rollup2
FUND FEES OR NEW TAXES THOSE ARE

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.282 region:rollup2
KIND OF YOUR OTHER MIX OF

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.849 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FUNDS IF YOU WANT TO

01:11:59.282 --> 01:12:00.483 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AN AUGMENTATION FOR

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:02.018 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:03.252 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.820 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED THEY ARE GOING

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:06.622 region:rollup2
THROUGH A BUDGETARY REVIEW RIGHT

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.557 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S TAKING A LOOK AT HOW

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:08.758 region:rollup2
THEY'RE USING THEIR EXISTING

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:10.193 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND HOW WELL THOSE

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:11.627 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH THEIR EXISTING

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:13.529 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES IT'S HARD. TO MAKE A

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.564 region:rollup2
DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING THAT

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:15.965 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND YOU WON'T HAVE

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:17.233 region:rollup2
IT BASED ON THEIR TIMELINE BY

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:19.101 region:rollup2
THE TIME YOU NEED TO MAKE A

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:20.703 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR THIS BUDGET.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.672 region:rollup2
SO ONE OPTION YOU HAVE IS YOU

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:24.907 region:rollup2
COULD USE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:26.876 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATIONS ABOVE AND BEYOND

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:28.411 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO USE FROM NBA

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:29.745 region:rollup2
OR OTHER SOURCES AND THEN

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:30.880 region:rollup2
REVISIT IT IN THE SUBSEQUENT

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:32.548 region:rollup2
YEAR ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE RESULTS

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.884 region:rollup2
OF THAT BUDGETARY REVIEW TO SEE

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:36.185 region:rollup2
IF OTHER FEES OR. OTHER SOURCES

01:12:34.884 --> 01:12:38.054 region:rollup2
MAY BE APPROPRIATE.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.388 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.923 region:rollup2
OUR PACKAGE OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:42.291 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND INCLUDING A

ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN IN THIS

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.780 region:rollup2
REVIEW. FROM THAT THEY'RE TAKING

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:06.649 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT LONGER THEY'RE

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.317 region:rollup2
DOING A MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW BUT

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.352 region:rollup2
WE THINK YOU KNOW SETTING A

BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT SEVEN

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:22.952 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS SOON ENOUGH

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.220 region:rollup2
FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:25.654 region:rollup2
FIGHT REMEMBER THE NUMBER YES

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.324 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY.

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:30.059 region:rollup2
I AND AND IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BY

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:30.993 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:34.029 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:36.532 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SOURCES THAT THE AN

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.999 region:rollup2
ENTIRE AMOUNT BE. FUNDED OUT OF

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.435 region:rollup2
THE.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:42.338 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:44.473 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE REASON THAT

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:46.208 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NOT

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:48.878 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THAT VERSUS THESE

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:51.213 region:rollup2
OTHER SOURCES SINCE THERE. ARE.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:53.015 region:rollup2
I FELT.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.817 region:rollup2
CLEARLY CALLS ON THE ON ON THE

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.284 region:rollup2
OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE THAT

01:15:54.817 --> 01:15:57.186 region:rollup2
ARE BEING IDENTIFIED.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:58.821 region:rollup2
MISS.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:00.856 region:rollup2
A CHAIR MAT. MARROW RESPOND

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:03.526 region:rollup2
FIRST JR.

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:05.694 region:rollup2
SO.

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:08.831 region:rollup2
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PROSPECT

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:10.199 region:rollup2
AND I UNDERSTAND IT.

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:12.768 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK PASSED COULD BE PRO

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:14.970 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:16.772 region:rollup2
SO THE REASON WHY OUR DEPARTMENT

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:19.208 region:rollup2
HAS AN IMBALANCE RIGHT NOW IN

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:21.177 region:rollup2
OUR MAIN REPOSITORY. IS LARGELY

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:23.646 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF EARLIER FUN SHIPS OFF

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:24.213 region:rollup2
OF THE GENERAL FUND.

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:26.515 region:rollup2
YOU CAN COUNT THE AMOUNT OF

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:27.083 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.018 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT FUND SHIFTED

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.986 region:rollup2
OFFER.

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:32.988 region:rollup2
SO IN MY JUDGMENT RUNNING OUR

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:34.623 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:36.725 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:39.095 region:rollup2
CYCLICAL.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:41.430 region:rollup2
AND AN ANNUAL DETENTION BETWEEN

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.431 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURES ACROSS

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:45.601 region:rollup2
A WHOLE SUITE OF STATE.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:46.769 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.904 region:rollup2
I ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A POSSIBLE

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:52.341 region:rollup2
OPTION.

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:53.509 region:rollup2
BUT JUST LIKE I DEL CURRENTLY

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:56.378 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE AN APPETITE IN THE

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:57.680 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOR A. TAX.

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:59.415 region:rollup2
RELATED OUTDOOR GOODS OR OTHER

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.584 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS.

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:02.685 region:rollup2
AND LIKE I DOUBT.

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:04.153 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THAT MANY SECTORS IN

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.988 region:rollup2
OUR PORTFOLIO WE CAN INCREASE

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:07.623 region:rollup2
FEES ON.

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:10.159 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL THAT OUR DEPARTMENT IS

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:12.361 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIND AN ADDITIVE MORE

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:14.563 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE FUND SOURCE.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:16.065 region:rollup2
AND GENERAL FUND CREATES RISK

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:17.967 region:rollup2
FOR US IN THE DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:19.602 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT THE LORD GIVETH.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.370 region:rollup2
THE LORD MIGHT TAKE IT THE WAY.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:22.872 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT'S

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.340 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT INSTRUCTIVE FROM WHERE

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
WE SAID AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.409 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO WAY AND. EVEN

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.811 region:rollup2
THOUGH YOU DIRECTED THE QUESTION

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:30.446 region:rollup2
TO THE DEPARTMENT FUNDS I THINK

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.680 region:rollup2
OF.

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2

INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY HERE.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:39.388 region:rollup2

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:48.097 region:rollup2
FASHION IS THAT TO. WHEN THE

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:49.832 region:rollup2
NEXT DOWNTURN HAPPENS AS

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:52.234 region:rollup2

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:54.169 region:rollup2
IT WILL UNFORTUNATELY.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:56.839 region:rollup2
FISH AND WILDLIFE IS ONE OF THE

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:57.139 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACES NOT ONE OF THE LAST

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.140 region:rollup2
PLACES THAT.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:59.975 region:rollup2

THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IN

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:28.964 region:rollup2
THIS HYPOTHETICAL IS THANK YOU.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.200 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:33.569 region:rollup2
IS.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.237 region:rollup2
UNDER CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:37.339 region:rollup2
ARTICLE NINETEEN SECTION THREE

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:40.009 region:rollup2
BE.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:41.810 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE MONEY

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:43.479 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED FOR.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.680 region:rollup2
RESEARCH PLANNING CONSTRUCTION

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:46.482 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT MAY NETS IN

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.350 region:rollup2
OPERATION.

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:49.652 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC STREETS AND HIGHWAYS

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:52.388 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE MITIGATION OF

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:54.056 region:rollup2
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:55.824 region:rollup2
ROADS VEHICLES HAVE

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:56.792 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.560 region:rollup2
THE VILLAGE RATED SOME OF THE

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:00.462 region:rollup2
DATA AROUND THAT.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:03.165 region:rollup2
THE THIRD THING I'D SAY IS.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:04.400 region:rollup2
OUR WILDLIFE OFFICERS ARE.

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:07.102 region:rollup2
SWORN PEACE OFFICERS UNDER THE

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.704 region:rollup2
PENAL CODE.

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:11.707 region:rollup2
DAN IN DAY OUT THEY END UP

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:13.108 region:rollup2
ISSUING CITATIONS ABOUT.

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:15.177 region:rollup2
THE LAWS IN OPERATIONS OF OUR

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:17.680 region:rollup2
STREETS AND HIGHWAYS.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:19.581 region:rollup2
SO THEN.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.684 region:rollup2
WITH THAT CREATE A PROBLEM FOR.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:23.252 region:rollup2
IF

01:20:21.684 --> 01:20:24.820 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE CHP AND

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:26.789 region:rollup2
IDEA V. AS THERE WOULD THERE BE

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.190 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WITH THEIR FUNDING IF

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.491 region:rollup2
THE F. NOW WERE.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:31.460 region:rollup2
IF THE GENERAL FUND IS

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:33.062 region:rollup2
SUSPICIOUS AS YOU INDICATED AND

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.830 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED A STABLE REVENUE

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:36.198 region:rollup2
SOURCE I WOULD ASSUME THAT THE

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.133 region:rollup2
DMV IN THIS YEAR'S P. ALSO IT IS

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:39.935 region:rollup2
ABLE REVENUES.

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:42.237 region:rollup2
SO OVER CONSTANTLY DIVERTING

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.838 region:rollup2
MONEY FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.605 region:rollup2
OUT HOW WE SETTING EIGHT EIGHT

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.574 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:47.076 region:rollup2
A DIFFICULT PRESIDENT'S HERE.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:48.711 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG I THINK

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:50.379 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUERY

01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:52.614 region:rollup2
JUST WHY I APPRECIATE ALEJO'S

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:54.583 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION WE START BIG PICTURE

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:56.518 region:rollup2
ABOUT PURPOSE AND NEED.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:58.787 region:rollup2
I WOULD IMAGINE YOU SEE ME AGAIN

01:20:56.518 --> 01:21:00.723 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TIMES.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:02.725 region:rollup2
AND WE'LL GET INTO FUND SOURCE.

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:04.793 region:rollup2
A PRINCIPAL FOR OUR DEPARTMENT

01:21:02.725 --> 01:21:06.895 region:rollup2
IN THIS ENDEAVOR. IS TO KNOCK

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:08.230 region:rollup2
GORE SOMEONE ELSE'S OX.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:10.199 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRUE AS TO THE MOTOR

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.734 region:rollup2
VEHICLE CAL IT'S ALSO TRUE TO

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.435 region:rollup2
THE TIRE RECYCLING FUND.

01:21:11.734 --> 01:21:13.969 region:rollup2
WHICH SUPPORTS OUR COLLEAGUES IN

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.304 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.072 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:19.274 region:rollup2
IT'S WHY WE WERE SEEKING A BACK

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:20.642 region:rollup2
FILL. ONE TO ONE SO THERE WOULD

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:22.177 region:rollup2
NOT BE A LOSS ON THE MOTOR

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:24.079 region:rollup2
VEHICLE ACCOUNT.

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:26.081 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:28.083 region:rollup2
BRINGS IN ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:29.218 region:rollup2
BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUE. AND

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:30.552 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S FUND BALANCES

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.053 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.421 region:rollup2
AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:34.423 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:36.291 region:rollup2
NOW I DON'T ARGUE THE DMV AND

01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:37.993 region:rollup2
CHP MAY VALUE THAT EIGHTEEN

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:39.061 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:40.496 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD PUT THAT EIGHTEEN

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:42.164 region:rollup2
MILLION IN THE CONTEXT OF FUND

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:44.666 region:rollup2
BALANCE THAT MAY BE AT FOUR

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:46.535 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION.

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:48.804 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS THE NEXUS EGGS CAN

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:49.705 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU DETAIL AND DID IT SO

01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:50.873 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:52.474 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT THERE ARE

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:54.510 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THAT.

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:56.044 region:rollup2
THEY UNFORTUNATELY OF OUR HER

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.780 region:rollup2
HITTING WILDLIFE AND SO WE GOT

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:59.214 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:01.350 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERN AND THAT THAT'S THE

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:02.785 region:rollup2
NEXUS OF WHY YOU CAN TAKE A

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:03.886 region:rollup2
EUROPE THAT THE. THAT THE

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:05.954 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS TO

01:22:03.886 --> 01:22:09.825 region:rollup2
TO DIVERT WATER VEHICLE FUNDING

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:11.460 region:rollup2
TO FISH WILDLIFE.

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:13.362 region:rollup2
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.531 region:rollup2
LIKELY.

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:18.400 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION PERHAPS DISAGREEMENT

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:19.735 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXUS WE ALLEGE

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.770 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:23.539 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.840 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO

01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:27.009 region:rollup2
VARIABLES THAT ESTABLISHED THE

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.544 region:rollup2
NEXUS.

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:30.279 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE BIGGEST KILLER OF

01:22:28.544 --> 01:22:32.047 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE IN THE STATE OUR CARS.

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:34.716 region:rollup2
SECOND.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:36.852 region:rollup2
OUR GAME WARDENS.

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:38.520 region:rollup2
OVERSEE AND ADMINISTER NOT AS A

01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:40.622 region:rollup2
PRIMARY ENTITY BUT CERTAINLY AS

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.424 region:rollup2
A SUPPORTING ENTITY.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.692 region:rollup2
OF THE LAWS IN THE OPERATIONS OF

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:47.095 region:rollup2
OUR ROADS.

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:48.530 region:rollup2
AND HIGHWAYS.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.331 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THAT THE AVERAGE

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:52.534 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN WOULD ACCEPT THAT

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:53.802 region:rollup2
NEXUS.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:55.003 region:rollup2
I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.904 region:rollup2
AVERAGE CALIFORNIA BUT I

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:58.674 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A

01:22:55.904 --> 01:23:00.442 region:rollup2
REASONABLE ARGUMENT.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:02.010 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE A DIVERSION OF

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:04.913 region:rollup2
THE. CARL MOYER FUNDS.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:08.217 region:rollup2
A.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:10.219 region:rollup2
IT'S BACK FILLED BY ONE YEAR.

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:11.053 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD NOT IF IT'S GONNA BE

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.921 region:rollup2
BACK THOUGH BY CAP AND TRADE

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:15.090 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WHY WOULDN'T CAP AND

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:16.158 region:rollup2
TRADE FUNDS BE USED TO ADDRESS

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.826 region:rollup2
THE SHORTFALL ORIGINALLY

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:25.567 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE?

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:26.802 region:rollup2
SHIFTING ALL THIS MONEY AROUND.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.770 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING METAL MANIA

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:30.172 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO JUST TO

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.974 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR ABOUT CAP AND TRADE.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:33.942 region:rollup2
OTHER OUR LEGAL STRUCTURES

01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:36.144 region:rollup2
AROUND THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:38.914 region:rollup2
WHERE. CAPITA NEEDS TO BE USED

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:40.749 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR ACTIVISM REDUCE

01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:42.017 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS GREENHOUSE GAS

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:44.086 region:rollup2
EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.621 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE CAP

01:23:44.086 --> 01:23:47.022 region:rollup2
INTRIGUED PACKAGE A LATER ON

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:49.825 region:rollup2
YOU'LL SEE THAT ALL OF THE

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:51.326 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE RELATED TO REDUCING

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:52.160 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS OR SEQUESTERING

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:53.896 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS.

UP THE CRIME LAWYER PROGRAM

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:55.797 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.866 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS CLEAN TRUCKS AND

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:59.668 region:rollup2
VEHICLES. DOES HAVE THE EFFECT

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.836 region:rollup2
OF REDUCING EMISSIONS AND SO

01:23:59.668 --> 01:24:02.771 region:rollup2
THEREFORE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

01:24:00.836 --> 01:24:04.706 region:rollup2
USE A CAP AND TRADE THE FISH AND

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:07.809 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.809 region:rollup2
THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. WHILE

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:12.347 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:13.882 region:rollup2
RESULTING IN A EMISSION

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:16.218 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS ARE SEQUESTRATION.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:19.054 region:rollup2
ARE HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:19.221 region:rollup2
TIRES AND TIRES BEING A PROXY

TO.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:23.792 region:rollup2
.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:25.394 region:rollup2
THAT AFFECTS ON AUTOMOBILES

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:28.030 region:rollup2
HAVE ON WILDLIFE AND HABITAT

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:29.965 region:rollup2
IT'S A VERY A STRONG NEXUS OF

01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:32.034 region:rollup2
FROM A POLICY.

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:35.504 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:36.972 region:rollup2
SO WITH GIVE ME THE NEXUS AGAIN.

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:39.675 region:rollup2
I LIVE ON THE FUND THE TIRE FEE

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:42.077 region:rollup2
YEAH SO TIRES ARE THE.

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:43.712 region:rollup2
APART OF AUTOMOBILE USE IN

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.681 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:24:43.712 --> 01:24:45.981 region:rollup2
AND SO AS THE DIRECTORS

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:49.318 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:24:45.981 --> 01:24:51.420 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MOMENTS.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:53.922 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CLEAR.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:56.191 region:rollup2
ADVERSE EFFECT THAT AUTOMOBILE

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:57.793 region:rollup2
USE HAS BOTH FROM.

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.494 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE.

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.996 region:rollup2
IMPACT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:04.099 region:rollup2
HABITAT FIRST.

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:06.301 region:rollup2
SO YOU INTO SO AND SO USING. A

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:08.003 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING SOURCE THAT IS LINKED

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:10.405 region:rollup2
TO AUTOMOBILE USE

01:25:08.003 --> 01:25:12.941 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:13.875 region:rollup2
ON A OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:16.445 region:rollup2
IS A.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:18.814 region:rollup2
CLEAR BOTH LEGAL IS A LEGAL USE

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:19.915 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS A UP POLICY USE.

01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:21.483 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:22.250 region:rollup2
.

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:25.554 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:27.189 region:rollup2
THE FUND'S THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:29.691 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED FROM THAT

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:31.226 region:rollup2
ARE MADE ENTIRELY HOLE THROUGH

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:32.894 region:rollup2
THE A CAP AND TRADE FOR.

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.096 region:rollup2
SO JUST SO I UNDERSTAND.

TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:38.600 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN FUNDED UNDER THE

01:25:36.198 --> 01:25:40.235 region:rollup2
TIRE FEE THAT GET SHIFTED TO

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.903 region:rollup2
FISH AND WILDLIFE.

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:43.872 region:rollup2
AND THEN CAP AND TRADE.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:45.273 region:rollup2
SHIFTED TO PAY BACK THOUGH

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.274 region:rollup2
COBBLER.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:47.342 region:rollup2
CORRECT AND THAT'S GONNA BE DONE

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:49.778 region:rollup2
ONGOING BASIS ON AN ONGOING

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:50.979 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.280 region:rollup2
NOW WE CAN'T TIE THE HANDS OF

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.582 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE HOW CAN

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.250 region:rollup2
YOU SAY THAT WE CAN.

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:56.218 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE DONE ONGOING I'M

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.919 region:rollup2
MERELY REFLECTING WHAT THE

01:25:56.218 --> 01:26:00.055 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:25:57.919 --> 01:26:01.790 region:rollup2
IS AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:26:00.055 --> 01:26:03.558 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSAL WHAT WE'RE

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:04.893 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS THAT TWENTY SIX

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:07.029 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS CAN. BE

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:08.463 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED ON GOING AS PART OF A

01:26:07.029 --> 01:26:10.565 region:rollup2
SIMPLY A BASELINE.

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:12.200 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN IT'S ADDED IN THE

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:13.935 region:rollup2
BASELINE WE DON'T COME BACK

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.470 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR ASKING.

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:16.972 region:rollup2
FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.572 region:rollup2
BCP'S

01:26:16.972 --> 01:26:18.673 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST PART OF THE BASELINE

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:20.509 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:25.113 region:rollup2
S. A GENERAL SENSE.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:26.681 region:rollup2
A IS A PRETTY SECURE OF FUND

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:28.617 region:rollup2
WAY TO FUND A PROGRAM.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:30.018 region:rollup2
ADDED AS

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:31.987 region:rollup2
MAYBE I CAN MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:33.021 region:rollup2
BUT I I.

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:35.223 region:rollup2
I WOULD ASSUME THOUGH THAT IF

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:37.492 region:rollup2
YOU ARE DEALING WITH WILDLIFE

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:38.927 region:rollup2
AND WHILE HIGH WILDLIFE HABITAT

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:40.429 region:rollup2
AND PRESERVATION THAT THERE IS

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:46.368 region:rollup2
SOME CAP AND TRADE. TEXAS.

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:49.438 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:52.174 region:rollup2
TO DATE.

01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:54.076 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE.

01:26:52.174 --> 01:26:56.678 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF G. R. F. TO OUR

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:58.447 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. IS FOCUSED ON

01:26:56.678 --> 01:27:00.115 region:rollup2
HABITAT RESTORATION THE ACTUAL

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:02.250 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL. RESTORATION OF

01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:02.851 region:rollup2
WETLANDS WHICH

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.785 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH TURNED OUT

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:05.387 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:07.722 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE HIGHER CARBON

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:10.125 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER THAT'S A WORD TYPE OF

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:11.460 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPES.

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:12.961 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.696 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:16.798 region:rollup2
YOU'VE PUT ON A NEXUS TO

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:18.934 region:rollup2
CONTROLLING EMISSIONS.

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:20.869 region:rollup2
NOT MANAGING THE OTHER ASPECTS

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:22.537 region:rollup2
OF A WARMING CLIMATE WHICH ARE

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:24.072 region:rollup2
ADAPTATION RELATED.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:25.540 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE HAD VERY LIMITED YOU

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.875 region:rollup2
ARE A FUNDS.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.710 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEEN DIRECTED TO THAT

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:30.445 region:rollup2
VERY CREDIBLE AND LEGITIMATE

01:27:28.710 --> 01:27:32.914 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS CONTROL TO WETLAND

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:34.182 region:rollup2
RESTORATION.

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:36.084 region:rollup2
A IS IF YOU ARE QUESTIONS WHICH

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:38.019 region:rollup2
CHAIR AT IN TERMS TO THE LA SHOW

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:39.087 region:rollup2
ARE THERE OTHER AVENUES OF

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:40.756 region:rollup2
FUNDING I NEED YOU MENTIONED

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:42.757 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND OTHER IS IT'S MY

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:45.160 region:rollup2
OUT. A MILE THE FIELD THAT CAP

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:46.762 region:rollup2
AND TRADE SHOULD NOT BE ON THE

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.297 region:rollup2
TABLE IN TERMS OF. OUR.

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:51.700 region:rollup2
JUDGE US IN THE SHORTFALL.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:52.534 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.336 region:rollup2
CONCUR WITH

01:27:52.534 --> 01:27:55.670 region:rollup2
THE.

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:57.038 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.607 region:rollup2
AT LEAST RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE

01:27:57.038 --> 01:28:00.442 region:rollup2
LEGAL OPINIONS THAT LEGISLATIVE

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:01.943 region:rollup2
COUNSEL HAS PUT ON THE USE OF

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:04.479 region:rollup2
GGF IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:07.082 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEXUS ON EMISSIONS.

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:08.517 region:rollup2
I THINK IN IN SOME OF THE

01:28:07.082 --> 01:28:09.618 region:rollup2
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN AND SO AND

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:11.353 region:rollup2
FUTURE YEARS THERE MAY BE MORE

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:13.555 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW YOU USE

01:28:11.353 --> 01:28:15.123 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS BUT. KICK COUNSELORS

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:16.992 region:rollup2
A PINE THAT AND IN THE NEAR TERM

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.160 region:rollup2
IT THAT NEXUS NEEDS TO BE BILLY

01:28:16.992 --> 01:28:19.761 region:rollup2
GRAHAM.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.164 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO GREENHOUSE GAS

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:23.832 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND SEQUESTRATION.

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF YOUR CONCERNS WITH

01:28:23.832 --> 01:28:27.269 region:rollup2
THE NEXUS.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.572 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU DO YOU SEE A CLEAR

01:28:27.269 --> 01:28:32.707 region:rollup2
NEXUS IS THIS NEXUS MAKES SENSE?

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:34.442 region:rollup2
I THINK AS AS I MENTIONED

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:36.678 region:rollup2
EARLIER WE SEE IN CONCEPTTHE

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:37.712 region:rollup2
NEXUS FOR THE NBA SEEMS THAT

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:39.981 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT'S ON CONCEPT

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:41.917 region:rollup2
THOUGH WELL I DON'T THINK IN

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:43.952 region:rollup2
CONCEPT THE TIRE IS LESS THAT

01:28:41.917 --> 01:28:44.820 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO US AND I THINK WE

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.021 region:rollup2
WE WOULD DRIVE DISTINCTION

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.722 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THOSE TWO WHERE THAT

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:49.457 region:rollup2
WHERE. IS FOR THE NBA THE

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:50.759 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION CLEARLY SAYS IT CAN

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:53.028 region:rollup2
USE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:54.930 region:rollup2
EFFECTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES WE

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:56.531 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT YET SEEN THAT SPECIFIC

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:57.966 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTING AND JUST VISION OF

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:59.067 region:rollup2
WHAT WORKLOAD THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:28:57.966 --> 01:29:00.435 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:02.871 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:03.872 region:rollup2
BOTH LEGALLY AND FROM A POLICY

01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:06.041 region:rollup2
BASIS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:07.108 region:rollup2
FOR THE NBA I THINK FOR THE TIRE

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.577 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE LANGUAGE THAT'S

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:10.712 region:rollup2
PROPOSED.

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:12.280 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THE TIRE FEE HAS

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:15.350 region:rollup2
BEEN STRUCTURED WE

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.885 region:rollup2
WE WE DON'T EQUATE TIRES WITH.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:19.054 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:19.654 region:rollup2
MORE BROADLY WITH WE WE WILL

01:29:19.054 --> 01:29:21.223 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:23.959 region:rollup2
NARROWLY AND. DIP IN NEGATIVE

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.926 region:rollup2
IMPACTS CREATED BY TIRES WE

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:26.194 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN THE JUST DUMPED HIM

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:27.963 region:rollup2
FOR THAT YET THEN MY LAST

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:30.198 region:rollup2
QUESTION IN TERMS OF SINCE IF

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:31.199 region:rollup2
THE NEXUS IS THAT. WE WANT TO

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:33.335 region:rollup2
PREVENT A.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.769 region:rollup2
A A COLLISIONS AND ACCIDENTS

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:36.605 region:rollup2
BETWEEN VEHICLES AND WILDLIFE

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:38.440 region:rollup2
WHICH IS

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:39.975 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IMPORTANT WHAT I HAVE

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.776 region:rollup2
AT OF THE EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:42.344 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT'S BEING DIVERTED.

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:44.779 region:rollup2
WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE TO

01:29:42.344 --> 01:29:47.215 region:rollup2
PREVENT THAT?

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:49.384 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:51.253 region:rollup2
BEFORE RESPONDING.

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:52.487 region:rollup2
I DON'T.

01:29:51.253 --> 01:29:56.291 region:rollup2
BACK THEN IT.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:59.961 region:rollup2
A.

01:29:56.291 --> 01:30:02.163 region:rollup2
YOU YOU YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:03.398 region:rollup2
NEED TO SOLVE.

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:05.600 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM I'M

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:06.201 region:rollup2
TRYING TO JUGGLE.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.202 region:rollup2
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH HERE'S

01:30:06.201 --> 01:30:09.237 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEM.

01:30:07.202 --> 01:30:10.505 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.673 region:rollup2
IT'S POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:14.709 region:rollup2
COULD FIND MORE SECTORS TO

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:16.411 region:rollup2
CHARGE FEES TO.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:17.846 region:rollup2
BUT HONESTLY THAT'S GONNA RUN TO

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.881 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:30:17.846 --> 01:30:20.482 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO RUN A BUSINESS.

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:22.417 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO RUN THE HUNTERS

01:30:20.482 --> 01:30:25.387 region:rollup2
AND ANGLERS.

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:27.155 region:rollup2
AND I'M HOPING.

01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:28.790 region:rollup2
INSTEAD DEFINED AN ADDITIVE FUND

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:30.625 region:rollup2
SOURCE WHICH HAS AN APPROPRIATE

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
NEXUS THAT CAN SUPPORT BENEFITS

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:36.264 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIANS.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:39.134 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT ENDEAVOR.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:40.435 region:rollup2
I WILL ALSO SAY THAT.

01:30:39.134 --> 01:30:41.403 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE CAN POINT TO

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:43.371 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THINGS AND.

01:30:41.403 --> 01:30:45.273 region:rollup2
.

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:48.910 region:rollup2
SIMON OF POSITIONS THAT RELATE

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:50.879 region:rollup2
TO THE WILDLIFE COLLISION NEXUS.

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:53.214 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK IT'S TRUE THAT.

01:30:50.879 --> 01:30:54.916 region:rollup2
WE WERE TRANSPARENT TEN

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:56.818 region:rollup2
ALLOCATING THE FIFTY MILLION IN

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:58.753 region:rollup2
THE NINETY EIGHT POSITIONS. THAT

01:30:56.818 --> 01:31:00.488 region:rollup2
A INCREDIBLY GRANULAR LEVEL OF

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:01.723 region:rollup2
DETAIL.

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:05.393 region:rollup2
SO EVERYONE COULD SEE WHAT WE

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:08.063 region:rollup2
WERE PROPOSING.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:10.865 region:rollup2
SOME OF THIS WORK AS DESCRIBED

01:31:08.063 --> 01:31:12.434 region:rollup2
WOULD OCCUR IN THE OCEAN.

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:14.669 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THERE'S

01:31:12.434 --> 01:31:15.136 region:rollup2
A WAY TO ENCOURAGE IT TECHNICAL

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:18.340 region:rollup2
FUND SHIFT WITHIN OUR

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:21.810 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:25.213 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE OUR WARDENS.

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:27.015 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:28.483 region:rollup2
IT COME OFF OF OTHER FUN SOURCES

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:29.784 region:rollup2
WERE USING FOR SOME OF THEIR

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:31.419 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:34.389 region:rollup2
WE COULDN'T MOVE THEM TO THE M.

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:35.323 region:rollup2
V. A AS AN EXAMPLE. WHICH WOULD

01:31:34.389 --> 01:31:38.193 region:rollup2
FREE UP OUR BUDGETING

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:39.861 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO THEN USE EXISTING

01:31:38.193 --> 01:31:41.529 region:rollup2
SOURCES FOR THAT MARINE WORK.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:43.765 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS PART OF THE

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:46.301 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURE BEHIND. I THINK ONE

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:48.203 region:rollup2
OF OUR MOST DETAILED PROPOSALS.

01:31:46.301 --> 01:31:49.337 region:rollup2
MISTER FUNG I AGREE THAT ONE OF

01:31:48.203 --> 01:31:50.338 region:rollup2
OUR NEXT STEPS THAT THE

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.806 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS TO DO THE

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:54.642 region:rollup2
QUANTIFICATION THE WORKLOAD

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:56.011 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION. AND PRESENT THAT

TO YOU AND STAFF I ACCEPT THAT

01:31:56.011 --> 01:32:00.281 region:rollup2
SO. OF IT I JUST ALSO WANTED TO

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:01.516 region:rollup2
ADD THAT YOU HAD ALLUDED EARLIER

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:03.051 region:rollup2
IN DISCUSSING THE MOTOR VEHICLE

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:05.553 region:rollup2
COUNT HOW IT SUPPORTS.

01:32:03.051 --> 01:32:05.754 region:rollup2
CHP AS WELL SCHEME BE IN THAT

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.522 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:32:05.754 --> 01:32:10.358 region:rollup2
IMPACT TRUE OF THE OTHER

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:10.892 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THINK IT'S FUNDED IS

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.627 region:rollup2
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:13.695 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T WANNA LOSE SIGHT

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:15.563 region:rollup2
OF THE FACT THAT THE AIR

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:16.898 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BOARD. AYE AS AN

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.833 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY THAT'S

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:20.402 region:rollup2
CHARGED WITH A ADDRESSING THE

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:23.338 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF

01:32:20.402 --> 01:32:24.773 region:rollup2
AUTOMOBILE USE IS ALREADY. A SO

01:32:23.338 --> 01:32:26.708 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE PRESIDENT TO USING

01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:28.276 region:rollup2
A VA FOR THOSE TYPES OF ACT OF

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:30.078 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:32.414 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO I'LL JUST CONCLUDE

01:32:30.078 --> 01:32:35.116 region:rollup2
BY SAYING I KNOW THAT THERE'S A.

01:32:32.414 --> 01:32:37.285 region:rollup2
A A QUEST TO FIND A NEXUS THAT

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.219 region:rollup2
IN IN MY OPINION IT IS A LITTLE

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:40.055 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO WRAP MY HANDS

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:42.257 region:rollup2
AROUND. I THINK THAT BEFORE WE

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:44.592 region:rollup2
LOOK AT RAISING FEES OR.

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:46.027 region:rollup2
OR THE THREAT OF RAISING FEES I

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:47.929 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE SEE HONESTLY HAVE

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:49.064 region:rollup2
TO BE. REALISTIC IN TERMS OF

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:50.632 region:rollup2

AND TRADE DOLLARS THAT ARE THERE

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:58.606 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THERE. BUT IN TERMS

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:00.208 region:rollup2

NEED A TO FILL A GAP.

01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:46.120 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS BUT NOW

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.522 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S DONE IN THE PAST

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.023 region:rollup2
DOESN'T JUSTIFY THAT WE SHOULD

01:33:47.522 --> 01:33:50.825 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO IT OVER AND OVER

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:53.061 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN FOR FOR A VARIOUS

01:33:50.825 --> 01:33:54.229 region:rollup2
THINGS. AND SO THAT'S MY CONCERN

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.730 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:57.632 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:59.968 region:rollup2
ROB ONE AGENCY TO ANOTHER AGENCY

01:33:57.632 --> 01:34:02.937 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:05.673 region:rollup2
PATTERSON.

UP.

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:10.178 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ONE THING.

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:12.313 region:rollup2
ARE TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING

01:34:10.178 --> 01:34:14.582 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN.

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:16.284 region:rollup2
IT'S ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY.

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:17.886 region:rollup2
TO DO IT WHETHER YOU OUGHT OR

01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:19.320 region:rollup2
OUGHT NOT TO DO IT.

01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:20.555 region:rollup2
AND I WILL TELL YOU MY BIG HEART

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.923 region:rollup2
BURN IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE

01:34:20.555 --> 01:34:23.558 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN MAKING PROMISES TO THE

01:34:21.923 --> 01:34:25.393 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:27.462 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF ME I

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:29.330 region:rollup2
THINK BREAKS THOSE PROMISES.

01:34:27.462 --> 01:34:30.765 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY VERY

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:32.800 region:rollup2
SERIOUS BIG PICTURE.

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:35.503 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.538 region:rollup2
THERE IS IN AREAS.

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:38.239 region:rollup2
THAT I REPRESENT.

01:34:36.538 --> 01:34:39.874 region:rollup2
AND LOTS OF OTHER MEMBERS UP

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:42.277 region:rollup2
AND DOWN THE STATE. THERE IS AN

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:43.745 region:rollup2
UNDERCURRENT OF DISTRUST OF

01:34:42.277 --> 01:34:45.280 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND DISTRUST.

01:34:43.745 --> 01:34:47.482 region:rollup2
BROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.250 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY SEE PROMISES MADE

01:34:47.482 --> 01:34:50.618 region:rollup2
AND A PROMISE IS BROKEN.

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:52.754 region:rollup2
THIS IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:56.591 region:rollup2
THING.

01:34:52.754 --> 01:34:58.493 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES UP MISS TRUST.

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:59.994 region:rollup2
OUR I SO I MEAN THE THE POINT

01:34:58.493 --> 01:35:01.396 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MAKING IS WE CAN DO IT SO

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:03.531 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. I DON'T

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:04.165 region:rollup2
THINK YOU SHOULD BE THINKING IN

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.833 region:rollup2
THOSE TERMS I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:07.468 region:rollup2
BE THINKING IN. TERMS OF WHETHER

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:09.170 region:rollup2
OR NOT THIS IS PROMISE A MAY

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.704 region:rollup2
PROMISE KEPT IN WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.605 region:rollup2
YOU OUGHT.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:14.042 region:rollup2
BUT TO DO IT.

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:16.544 region:rollup2
.

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:19.013 region:rollup2
SO NETANYAHU WHETHER THERE'S A.

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:20.548 region:rollup2
LIMITED NEXUS OR NOT.

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:22.817 region:rollup2
STRETCHING THE NEXUS IS IN MANY

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:23.785 region:rollup2
WAYS JUST.

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:25.687 region:rollup2
AN EXCUSE FOR DOING SOMETHING.

01:35:23.785 --> 01:35:26.187 region:rollup2
A.

01:35:25.687 --> 01:35:28.022 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE THE STATE OF

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:29.457 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO TAKE MONEY FROM

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:31.059 region:rollup2
ONE THING OF AND AND PUT IT TO

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:32.260 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AYE I FIND THIS WHOLE

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:33.995 region:rollup2
EXERCISE TO BE VERY VERY

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.597 region:rollup2
TROUBLING.

01:35:33.995 --> 01:35:37.332 region:rollup2
NUMBER TO THAT DAY THE CAR MORE

01:35:35.597 --> 01:35:39.133 region:rollup2
YOUR PROGRAM THE TIRE PROGRAM

01:35:37.332 --> 01:35:41.169 region:rollup2
ALL OF THAT.

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:43.171 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED IT

01:35:41.169 --> 01:35:45.239 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN VERY VERY EFFECTIVE.

01:35:43.171 --> 01:35:47.108 region:rollup2
AND THE PROMISE MADE HERE IS

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:49.344 region:rollup2
THAT DOWD WE'RE GONNA BACK

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:50.645 region:rollup2
PHILIP THE BACKFILL IS ON GOING.

01:35:49.344 --> 01:35:52.580 region:rollup2
I LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE I'VE

01:35:50.645 --> 01:35:53.448 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THIS AND

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.816 region:rollup2
VERIFIED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ALL

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:57.051 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

01:35:54.816 --> 01:35:58.620 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO ONGOING COMMITMENT.

01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:00.655 region:rollup2
TO BACK FILL YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:02.523 region:rollup2
ONGOING COMMITMENT.

01:36:00.655 --> 01:36:05.893 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST.

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:07.795 region:rollup2
THE WILL OF THE VERY FORCES

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:08.663 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT MAKE.

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:10.732 region:rollup2
TOUCHING THE GENERAL FUND

01:36:08.663 --> 01:36:13.267 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC.

01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:14.669 region:rollup2
AND SO THE RISK THAT YOU SUGGEST

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:16.404 region:rollup2
IN THE GENERAL FUND I THINK IS

01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:18.273 region:rollup2
JUST AS MUCH.

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:19.907 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT RISK.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:21.476 region:rollup2
IN THIS OTHER REPROACH.

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.945 region:rollup2
AND THEN NOT.

01:36:21.476 --> 01:36:26.080 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE UP.

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:27.415 region:rollup2
I FIND IT NOT I FIND IT

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.351 region:rollup2
BORDERLINE.

01:36:27.415 --> 01:36:33.121 region:rollup2
HYPOCRITICAL.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:34.689 region:rollup2
THAT OUT THAT ON ONE ITEM.

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:36.391 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD BE SO.

01:36:34.689 --> 01:36:38.293 region:rollup2
CAREFUL

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:40.662 region:rollup2
AND PRECISE WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:42.196 region:rollup2
USE OF GREENHOUSE.

01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:43.731 region:rollup2
GAS IS TO THE POINT THAT THAT.

01:36:42.196 --> 01:36:45.700 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT YOU WOULD DIE.

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:47.869 region:rollup2
CONSTRAIN THEM FROM SORT OF A

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:49.170 region:rollup2
LIMITED NEXUS TEST.

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:51.606 region:rollup2
WHEN IN FACT THE STATE OF

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.939 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TAKES.

01:36:51.606 --> 01:36:54.275 region:rollup2
AWFUL LOT OF.

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:56.511 region:rollup2
.

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:58.446 region:rollup2
A GREENHOUSE GAS MONEY.

01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:59.947 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO PAY FOR OUT OF.

01:36:58.446 --> 01:37:01.916 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT DOES NOT

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:04.919 region:rollup2
MEET THAT NEXUS IN ANY SINGLE

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:05.420 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WAY. AND WE'VE HAD VERY

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:06.387 region:rollup2
CLEAR ANALYSIS FROM THE.

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.290 region:rollup2
.

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:11.826 region:rollup2
FROM THE ARAB.

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:13.027 region:rollup2
NOT FROM OUR OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE

01:37:11.826 --> 01:37:14.896 region:rollup2
ANALYST AT THAT JUST DOES NOT

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:15.263 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT NEXUS TESTS I I I

01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:17.565 region:rollup2
REALLY FIND THE.

01:37:15.263 --> 01:37:20.068 region:rollup2
.

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:21.669 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE TALK ABOUT.

01:37:20.068 --> 01:37:24.505 region:rollup2
MEAN THIS IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:25.573 region:rollup2
THIS IS BUDGETING SHELL GAME.

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:27.141 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE OUT HERE IN THIS

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:28.609 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE HAVE DISCOVERED AND

01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:29.110 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY AND I IS A

OBSERVED THAT.

01:37:58.506 --> 01:37:59.674 region:rollup2
IT'S EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:37:59.474 --> 01:38:02.143 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:37:59.674 --> 01:38:03.845 region:rollup2
.

01:38:02.143 --> 01:38:06.180 region:rollup2
THAT THAT OPENS THE DOOR.

CERTAIN AMOUNT SENSE TO ME IT'S

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:17.725 region:rollup2
ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OF THAT

01:38:15.490 --> 01:38:19.394 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:21.896 region:rollup2
I THINK THEIR ARGUMENT WOULD BE.

01:38:19.394 --> 01:38:23.798 region:rollup2
WILL LIKE IT BUT THAT'S TODAY

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.899 region:rollup2

A I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CONCERN.

01:38:45.153 --> 01:38:53.261 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:54.295 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:57.865 region:rollup2
I SUPPOSE THERE'S A WAY TO

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:59.600 region:rollup2
MANAGE THAT RISK.

01:38:57.865 --> 01:39:01.068 region:rollup2
LIKE OUR DEPARTMENT IS WILLING

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.937 region:rollup2

UNDERSTANDING.

01:39:14.816 --> 01:39:18.186 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEIR CONDITIONS OF MY

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:19.921 region:rollup2
CONTROL THAT RISK.

01:39:18.186 --> 01:39:21.556 region:rollup2

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ITS

01:55:38.365 --> 01:55:41.701 region:rollup2
CARS THAT WREAKED SUCH HAVOC ON

01:55:40.367 --> 01:55:48.542 region:rollup2
OUR WILDLIFE'S NOT THE TIRES ON

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:49.209 region:rollup2
THOSE CARS.

01:55:48.542 --> 01:55:51.211 region:rollup2
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS

01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
AARON READ REPRESENT CALIFORNIA

01:55:51.211 --> 01:55:53.980 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION HIGHWAY PATROLMAN.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:55.115 region:rollup2
A FIRST FOLLOWED ME SAY WE HAVE

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:56.850 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE

01:55:55.115 --> 01:55:57.617 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS THAT WORK IT FISH AND

01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:59.753 region:rollup2
WILDLIFE.

01:55:57.617 --> 01:56:01.822 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT THEM GETTING THE

01:55:59.753 --> 01:56:04.024 region:rollup2
FUNDING BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:56:01.822 --> 01:56:05.392 region:rollup2
NBA'S AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE OF

01:56:04.024 --> 01:56:06.493 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR.

01:56:05.392 --> 01:56:07.961 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT

01:56:06.493 --> 01:56:09.629 region:rollup2
OF WE WOULD SUPPORT ANY OTHER

01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:11.765 region:rollup2
SOURCES.

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:13.967 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND IS PROVIDED

01:56:11.765 --> 01:56:16.303 region:rollup2
ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THEIR

01:56:13.967 --> 01:56:17.771 region:rollup2
BUDGET IT SEEMS KIND OF CRAZY

01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:18.705 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T LOOK TOWARDS AT

01:56:17.771 --> 01:56:20.006 region:rollup2
SOURCE SINCE THERE'S A HUGE

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:22.075 region:rollup2
BUDGET SURPLUS.

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:23.944 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR GRANTED THEIR YEARS

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:25.045 region:rollup2
IT'S WIENER BUT DURING THE LEAN

01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:26.680 region:rollup2
YEARS HE DIDN'T GO THROUGH ANY

01:56:25.045 --> 01:56:29.015 region:rollup2
LAYOFFS NO EMPLOYEES WERE LAID

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:30.684 region:rollup2
OFF. OF THAT THEY DID SPACE CUTS

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:32.519 region:rollup2
THAT'S FOR SURE SO WE SUPPORT

01:56:30.684 --> 01:56:35.088 region:rollup2
THEM BEING MADE WHOLE BUT THE

01:56:32.519 --> 01:56:36.857 region:rollup2
NBA COUNT IS VERY TENTATIVE LET

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:38.291 region:rollup2
ME JUST SAY MY FORTY YEARS. OF

01:56:36.857 --> 01:56:39.392 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING THE HIGHWAY PATROL

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:40.627 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION.

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:42.062 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF THOSE YEARS THE

01:56:40.627 --> 01:56:44.397 region:rollup2
VOTE REQUIRED WAS TWO THIRDS

01:56:42.062 --> 01:56:46.166 region:rollup2
VOTE AND THE THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:49.035 region:rollup2
FELL TO THE ASSOCIATION TO TRY

01:56:46.166 --> 01:56:50.337 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE THAT. AMOUNT A YEAR

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:51.605 region:rollup2
AFTER YEAR AND IT WAS A HEAVY

01:56:50.337 --> 01:56:54.007 region:rollup2
LIFT.

01:56:51.605 --> 01:56:55.842 region:rollup2
AND IS ONCE AGAIN BECOME A HEAVY

01:56:54.007 --> 01:56:57.811 region:rollup2
LIFT BECAUSE A CAR TAX IS

01:56:55.842 --> 01:57:00.680 region:rollup2
INCREASING WITH THE PASSAGE OF

01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:02.015 region:rollup2
SB ONE WE NOW HAVE AN ADDED TAX

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.783 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE TWELVE CENTS

01:57:02.015 --> 01:57:05.585 region:rollup2
PER GALLON. WE HAVE AN ADDED TAX

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:07.220 region:rollup2
ON CARS IN ADDITION TO THE

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:08.922 region:rollup2
VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE SO

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:11.258 region:rollup2
THERE'S REALLY. A THREE

01:57:08.922 --> 01:57:11.758 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FUNDS TO GET THE NBA A

01:57:11.258 --> 01:57:13.493 region:rollup2
LICENSE OF MOTOR VEHICLE

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:15.562 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:17.197 region:rollup2
THE VLF VEHICLE LICENSE FEE

01:57:15.562 --> 01:57:19.699 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A PERSONAL PROPERTY

01:57:17.197 --> 01:57:20.467 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER CAR IN THE THIRD TAXES

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.935 region:rollup2
PART OF SP ONE.

01:57:20.467 --> 01:57:23.904 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BECOME A MUCH HARDER

01:57:21.935 --> 01:57:25.005 region:rollup2
LIFT IF I MAY JUST QUOTE TWO

01:57:23.904 --> 01:57:25.906 region:rollup2
SHORT SENTENCES FROM YOUR

01:57:25.005 --> 01:57:27.440 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

01:57:25.906 --> 01:57:29.476 region:rollup2
ON PAGE.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:32.078 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN.

01:57:29.476 --> 01:57:32.979 region:rollup2
WHERE DISCUSSES THE NBA CAO

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:34.781 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PARAGRAPH SAYS

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:37.083 region:rollup2
FURTHER THIS ACCOUNT HAS BEEN

01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:38.518 region:rollup2
UNDER PRESSURE IN RECENT YEARS

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:39.920 region:rollup2
AND WOULD HAVE A PROJECTED

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:41.521 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL?

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:43.556 region:rollup2
IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID NOT

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:45.559 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:47.027 region:rollup2
MILLION AND PROPOSALS TO SHIFT

01:57:45.559 --> 01:57:50.096 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS

01:57:47.027 --> 01:57:54.301 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY FUNDED. FROM THE NBA.

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:55.669 region:rollup2
TO LEASE REVENUE BONDS.

01:57:54.301 --> 01:57:56.970 region:rollup2
THESE AT THIS ADDED PRESSURE ON

01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:58.305 region:rollup2
THE NBA.

01:57:56.970 --> 01:58:00.206 region:rollup2
COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT

01:57:58.305 --> 01:58:02.842 region:rollup2
INCREASING FEES ON MOTORS IT

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:04.611 region:rollup2
WILL RESULT INCREASING FEES WILL

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:06.713 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COME BACK AND GET A

01:58:04.611 --> 01:58:09.015 region:rollup2
VEHICLE. A.

01:58:06.713 --> 01:58:10.884 region:rollup2
BLF FOR AN MBA INCREASE AND WILL

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:11.484 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE TO DO IT NEXT THIS

01:58:10.884 --> 01:58:13.219 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:15.322 region:rollup2
OR NO LATER THAN NEXT

01:58:13.219 --> 01:58:17.223 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT AND ALSO THE LEAST

01:58:15.322 --> 01:58:18.425 region:rollup2
REVENUE BONDS WILL COST HAS OVER

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:20.327 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:58:18.425 --> 01:58:20.994 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN INTEREST.

01:58:20.327 --> 01:58:22.796 region:rollup2
OVER THE LIFE OF FINANCING THESE

01:58:20.994 --> 01:58:23.964 region:rollup2
PROJECTS

01:58:22.796 --> 01:58:25.098 region:rollup2

PRECIPITATION. AND IT'S THE

02:20:05.497 --> 02:20:08.767 region:rollup2
PRIMARY TIME PERIOD FOR THE

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:11.637 region:rollup2

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:19.578 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS ARE DRIER STILL IN

02:20:18.477 --> 02:20:21.046 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE MANY

BASINS HAVE ACCUMULATED ONLY

02:20:21.046 --> 02:20:24.216 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR

ABUNDANT PRECIPITATION.

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:47.839 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF WATER IN

INSTANCES WHERE A WET MARCH I

02:20:58.417 --> 02:21:02.120 region:rollup2

IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:12.516 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS MORE SINCE TWENTY

02:48:31.501 --> 02:48:35.806 region:rollup2
WE AS CALIFORNIANS CAN

02:48:33.604 --> 02:48:37.541 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT.

02:48:35.806 --> 02:48:38.675 region:rollup2
IT'S HEARTBREAKING AND THERE'S A

02:48:37.541 --> 02:48:40.043 region:rollup2

MAKING THAT DIFFERENCE.

02:48:44.915 --> 02:48:46.450 region:rollup2

02:48:48.652 --> 02:48:51.488 region:rollup2
AS I'VE TAKEN PAINS TO FLAG EACH

02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.923 region:rollup2
TIME I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE WE

02:48:51.488 --> 02:48:54.725 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED BRINGING THE

02:48:52.923 --> 02:48:55.692 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER PROGRAM OVER. THE

02:48:54.725 --> 02:48:57.094 region:rollup2
MOST SIGNIFICANT REMAINING

02:48:55.692 --> 02:48:58.629 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WILL BE THE LACK OF A

02:48:57.094 --> 02:49:00.497 region:rollup2

02:49:02.099 --> 02:49:05.268 region:rollup2
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE JUST SIMPLY

02:49:03.333 --> 02:49:07.004 region:rollup2
LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE

02:49:05.268 --> 02:49:08.271 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS FOR

DOMESTIC WELLS.

02:49:10.407 --> 02:49:13.877 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T BE CONSOLIDATED

02:49:12.476 --> 02:49:16.013 region:rollup2
IT IT IT'S FOR LARGER SYSTEM BUT

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:16.880 region:rollup2
ALSO HINDERS OUR ABILITY TO

02:49:16.013 --> 02:49:18.415 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATE.

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:19.750 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES CAN'T AFFORD TO

02:49:18.415 --> 02:49:20.717 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND

02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:21.918 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CURRENTLY SERVING

02:49:20.717 --> 02:49:24.955 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER THAT DOESN'T MEET

02:49:21.918 --> 02:49:25.822 region:rollup2
HEALTH STANDARDS.

02:49:24.955 --> 02:49:27.057 region:rollup2

02:49:32.162 --> 02:49:35.365 region:rollup2
KEY THING THERE IS WITHOUT THE

ABOUT WHAT THE CONSISTENCY WITH

THE STATE'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER

02:52:45.155 --> 02:52:48.825 region:rollup2

THE PROGRAM.

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:54.898 region:rollup2
AND ALSO CONSISTENCY WITH THE

02:52:52.162 --> 02:52:55.699 region:rollup2
POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE SOME

02:52:54.898 --> 02:52:56.600 region:rollup2
SKIN GOV AT THESE BRIEFLY.

02:52:55.699 --> 02:52:58.869 region:rollup2
I'M WE BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:52:56.600 --> 02:53:00.136 region:rollup2

02:52:58.869 --> 02:53:02.072 region:rollup2
STATE STATUTORY POLICY THAT

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:04.140 region:rollup2
EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS THE RIGHT

ACCESSIBLE WATER. FIVE FOR ANY

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:09.446 region:rollup2
CONCEPTION AND THE PROPOSAL

02:53:08.178 --> 02:53:11.047 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

02:53:09.446 --> 02:53:12.249 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER MORE WIDELY

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:13.717 region:rollup2

REVENUES WILL FULLY ADDRESS THE

02:53:25.495 --> 02:53:29.833 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. AND IN LARGE PART THIS

02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:32.202 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE EXTENT OF THE

02:53:29.833 --> 02:53:33.803 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

02:53:32.202 --> 02:53:36.139 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA ABOUT THE

FUTURE.

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.723 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

02:53:52.923 --> 02:53:55.959 region:rollup2
THE MATTER OF REVENUE THAT WILL

02:53:53.723 --> 02:53:58.094 region:rollup2

PRINCIPLE IN THE POLLUTED PAYS

02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:41.304 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLE IS A CONCEPT THAT

THOSE ENTITIES THAT CAUSE

02:54:41.304 --> 02:54:42.639 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL HARM.

AND NEEDS PHYSICALLY HERE I'M

02:54:51.981 --> 02:54:55.585 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT NITRATE

02:54:53.383 --> 02:54:58.121 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION IN THE GROUND. AND

02:54:55.585 --> 02:55:00.223 region:rollup2
I IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT

02:54:58.121 --> 02:55:02.192 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD

02:55:02.192 --> 02:55:05.895 region:rollup2
BY AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES WOULD

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:06.296 region:rollup2
BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:08.531 region:rollup2
NIGHT TING NITRATE

02:55:06.296 --> 02:55:09.899 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION.

02:55:08.531 --> 02:55:12.435 region:rollup2
THAT IS COMING FROM THOSE

02:55:09.899 --> 02:55:14.437 region:rollup2
ENTITIES AND ALSO IT'S NOT

02:55:12.435 --> 02:55:15.972 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THAT SOME OF THE NITRATE

02:55:14.437 --> 02:55:18.375 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION THIS LEGACY

02:55:15.972 --> 02:55:20.677 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION FROM GOING BACK

02:55:18.375 --> 02:55:22.746 region:rollup2
DECADES AND SAID THE PEOPLE THAT

02:55:20.677 --> 02:55:24.647 region:rollup2
I AM. CURRENT AGRICULTURAL

02:55:22.746 --> 02:55:28.017 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS DIDN'T BECAUSE THAT

02:55:24.647 --> 02:55:29.552 region:rollup2
BUT SOME OF THAT FINDS THAT

02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:30.954 region:rollup2
THERE I WOULD PROVIDE.

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:31.588 region:rollup2
THROUGH THESE OUTSIDE THE MAC IN

02:55:30.954 --> 02:55:32.856 region:rollup2
OUR CHARGE MECHANISMS WOULD BE

02:55:31.588 --> 02:55:34.391 region:rollup2
USED TO CLEAN UP THAT LEGACY

02:55:32.856 --> 02:55:35.525 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION SO THOSE ARE THE

02:55:34.391 --> 02:55:37.127 region:rollup2
TWO REASONS WE FELT THAT IT

02:55:35.525 --> 02:55:38.495 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT FULLY IMPLEMENT THE

02:55:37.127 --> 02:55:40.964 region:rollup2
