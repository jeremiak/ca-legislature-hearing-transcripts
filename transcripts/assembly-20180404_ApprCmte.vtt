LOOKING THROUGH YOUR BILL THERE

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:24.449 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF.

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:26.184 region:rollup2
TREPIDATION WITH SOME FOLKS AND

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:27.686 region:rollup2
WE JUST HEARD ONE OF THEM

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:29.020 region:rollup2

THE MANDATE ISSUE COULD YOU

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.321 region:rollup2

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:32.457 region:rollup2
FOREST.

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:33.625 region:rollup2
AND KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT.

00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:35.527 region:rollup2
IT IS IT IS A QUESTION ON

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:37.228 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A MANDATE

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.762 region:rollup2
SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT I CAN HAVE

ADD TO THIS BUT I DO WANT TO

00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:43.101 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:44.602 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL STATUTE AND

00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:45.937 region:rollup2
SO THE GOAL IS TO HAVE IT IN

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:47.939 region:rollup2
STATE STATUTE AND I THINK THAT

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:48.840 region:rollup2

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:50.742 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T CHANGE WHO.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.709 region:rollup2
TO COMPLY WITH THIS I JUST MAKE

00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:53.478 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY THE

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.079 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW WOULD BE SOMETHING

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:56.047 region:rollup2
THAT AND WE WOULD BE DOING AT

NOT.

00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:06.357 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE FACT THAT.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:08.359 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS WOULD STILL NEED TO

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT SO THAT

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:11.696 region:rollup2

SINCE IT BECAME NON REFUNDABLE

THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS IS REALLY

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:42.280 region:rollup2

00:48:59.203 --> 00:49:02.640 region:rollup2
THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THIS IS

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:04.975 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT BEING CONSIDERED IS

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.643 region:rollup2
THAT NOW EVERY SHERIFF IN THE

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:26.430 region:rollup2
EXPENSE TO A LOT OF FOLKS BUT

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:26.964 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS THAT THE. STATE

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.899 region:rollup2

TO DO WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS OF

00:49:33.204 --> 00:49:35.906 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THIS WILL PUT A BURDEN

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:37.908 region:rollup2
ON A LOT OF COUNTIES.

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:40.044 region:rollup2
HERE IS THE FACT.

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:41.745 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALREADY BEING TAKEN CARE

00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:42.680 region:rollup2
OF AND DOES NOT NEED ANY

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:46.116 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:47.885 region:rollup2
LAWS OR REGULATIONS TO FIX

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:51.288 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM.

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:53.457 region:rollup2
THE ONLY TIME THAT CCW A
