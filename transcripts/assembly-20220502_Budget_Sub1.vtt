THAT THAT HAS COME TO MARKET

01:19:54.923 --> 01:20:00.428

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:01.596
FOR HOW OTHERS CAN REPLICATE

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.832
THAT PROCESS. NUMBER TWO- THAT

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.133
THERE'S BEEN POLICY ACTION TO

PATHWAY- SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.099
ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTRACT

TRACK RECORDS. THAT HAVE

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.214
DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE MODELS FOR

DRUG DEVELOPMENT DISTRIBUTION

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:56.484
AND PRODUCTION. MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.653
THESE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS HAVE

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.321
SHOWN THAT THEY CAN PARTNER WITH

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.656
THE STATE. AND BRING BIOSIMILAR

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.391

WITHOUT A PARTIAL INVESTMENT

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.097
FROM THE STATE. AND NO

PURCHASING COMMITMENTS WHILE BAY

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.835
WOULD SHOULDER THE COST OF

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.503
DISTRIBUTION AND ROLL OUT. A

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:17.505
PARTNERSHIP VIA CONTRACT

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:18.807
MANUFACTURING HAS THE

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.175
SIGNIFICANT PROMISE OF

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:24.179
SUBSTANTIAL SYSTEM WIDE SAVINGS-

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:25.747
THAT HAS BEEN PRESENCE ONE COSTS

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.916
COULD DECREASE DUE TO STEEP

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.986
PRICE COME COMPETITION. AND THEN

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.520
I'LL I'LL COVER THE THIRD

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:33.655
QUESTION WE RECEIVE ON THE

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:36.258
AGENDA ABOUT THE STATE- WHETHER

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.259
THE STATE WOULD ON THE

MANUFACTURINGFACILITY- THAT

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:43.865

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.567
CALAR EXPLOSIVE MORE INSULIN

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.402

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:49.204
CONTRACT MANUFACTURING APPROACH.

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:50.338
THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S MORE

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.674
EFFICIENT AND TIMELY IN BRINGING

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.277

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:59.414
THE PROPOSAL ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.783
COULD BE. MANUFACTURING BY THE

STATE DRUG MANUFACTURING IS VERY

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:08.356
COSTLY AND COMPLEX- SINCE THIS

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.257
DAY WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.859

CONTRACT MANUFACTURING THE STATE

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.512
LOWERS ITS REST BECAUSE THEY

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.913
WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE CONTRACT

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.182
MANUFACTURER TO CONTRIBUTE TO

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:35.684

THE. RANGE OF A HUNDRED BILLION.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:49.230
I WHICH WHICH ENOUGH TO THAT

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.199
PUTS CONSERVE WITH A REVIEW OF

INDUSTRY EXPERTS. THE STATE

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:57.339
WOULD CONTRIBUTE- HALF OF THIS

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:58.506
COST FOR THE MANUFACTURING

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:01.309

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:14.869
ENACTED- THE CARD THAT PROVIDES

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.370
BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS IN TERMS

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:17.471
OF PREDICTABILITY OF OUT OF

01:31:17.538 --> 01:31:19.473
POCKET COSTS BUT IT ALSO SHIFTS

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.977
THE COST TO HEALTH PLANS AND

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:28.683
PBMS SO- YOU. BUT THE BETTER OF

01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:29.784
HAVING A LOWER. BIOSIMILAR

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.018
INSULIN PRODUCT ON THE MARKET IS

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.054
THAT HEALTH PLANS- WOULD HAVE

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.622
MORE OF AN INCENTIVE TO COVER

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.557
THAT PRODUCT SO THAT. BECAUSE

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.861
THEIR CURRENT MORE OF THE COST-

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.462
FOR COVERING THAT PRODUCT- HOW

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:43.397
DID THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.199
COVERED ON THEIR FORMULARY. SO

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:46.801
THAT THEY KNOW THE CONSUMER

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:49.837
PICKS UP THAT PRODUCT- ON THE

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.239
HEALTH PLANS EITHER TOTAL

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:53.608
EXPENSES WOULD GO DOWN BECAUSE-

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:57.812
THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT IS FAR

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.881
LOWER THAN THE GRANDDAD'S- AND

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.515
THEN- YEAH AS I MENTIONED

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:05.286
EARLIER YOU KNOW- IF. HI IF THE

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.621
HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS ON COVER

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:08.589
OF MAIL ORDER PHARMACIES ANOTHER

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:11.492
OPTION- AND WE WOULD ALSO WORK

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:12.727
WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.495
THAT THAT NONTRADITIONAL RETAIL

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:17.565
CHAINS- SUCH AS OUR GROCERY

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.767
STORES OR OTHER TYPES OF VENUES

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.469
WHERE WE'RE CONSUMERS FREQUENTLY

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.504
SHOP- BUT THOSE COULD ALSO BE

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:25.973
OPTIONS FOR PROTECTING THE

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:30.244
PRODUCT. DR WOOD YEAH I JUST I

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.612
JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW UP- YOU KNOW

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:34.548
THE PBM ISSUE IS OF SIGNIFICANT

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:36.751
CONCERN AND I'VE- I'VE WORKED ON

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:38.719
THIS ARENA FOR A WHILE AND ONE

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:40.488
OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS THAT.

01:32:40.554 --> 01:32:42.456
WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.225
OVER THE YEARS WERE PBMS- WON'T

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:47.361
TAKE A LOWER COST ALTERNATIVE ON

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.096
OF THE FORMULARY BECAUSE THEY

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:50.965
DON'T GET A BIG ENOUGH REBATE.

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:52.266
THEY OPERATE IN THE REBATE WORLD

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.435
AND SO IF WE'RE RELYING ON ON

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:58.072
CITIZENS TO REQUEST THAT- THEN

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.007
THEN THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE THE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:01.309
CONTRACT AGREEMENT THEY HAVE

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.777
WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:05.379
AND SO ON AND SO THE PRICE MAY

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.148
BE REALLY MAY BE REALLY. WHEN

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:08.849
LIKELY WILL BE REALLY REALLY

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:11.719
APPEALING. BUT THE WHOLE THE

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:13.421
WHOLE OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:14.789
HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS INCLUDING

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.757
OUR OWN STATE WHO HAS USES

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:19.727
OPTUM. AS AS THAT ARE PRETTY

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:22.029
COMPLICATED SO- IS GREASE SOME

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.564
ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:24.265
ACTUALLY WORKING ON THIS PART OF

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:26.334
IT BECAUSE- IN SPITE OF THE FACT

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.635
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:30.204
INSTITUTE A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.406
YOU KNOW COPAY CAP- WHICH WHICH

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:35.242
IS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT THAT

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:38.012
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:40.414
THAT THAT THE FORMULARY WILL BE

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.316
PICKED UP- EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.285
PRODUCE IT FOR THIRTY DOLLARS.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.887
DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:48.956
THAT YEAH. YEAH THANK YOU WHERE

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:51.359
AN HOUR. AT I DO KIND OF WANTED

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.627
TO REFOCUS ON. CALM KIND OF WHAT

01:33:53.694 --> 01:33:55.329
WHAT THE CALORIE EXPIRES SIMILAR

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:56.597
INSULIN PRODUCT WOULD BE IT

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:57.231
WOULD BE PRETTY

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.033
TRANSFORMATIONAL. BECAUSE IT

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.234
WOULD BE A PRODUCT THAT'S BASED

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.436
BASED ON COSTS SO. THE CONSUMER

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.305
COULD IT BE APPROXIMATE THE

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:06.207
CURRENT THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:07.775
ABOUT ISIS PROFILE PRICES

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:10.745
CHARGED IN THE MARKET- UNINSURED

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.146
CONSUMERS ARTS WASN'T UP FOR

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.749
COST OF THAT. SO FOR US ABOUT

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:18.819
COST PRODUCT- ARE COMING TO THE

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:19.820
MARKET THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE.

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.088
DOT DOT CONSUMER COULD PURCHASE

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:23.157
IT ON THEIR OWN- ESPECIALLY ON

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:25.026
AN UNINSURED CONSUMERS WHO DON'T

01:34:25.092 --> 01:34:27.928
HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH PLANS- YOU

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.563
KNOW THAT THE REBATE NEGOTIATED

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:30.531
AMOUNT SUCH THAT THE HEALTH

01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:33.934
PLANS HAVE. SO THIS WOULD BE-

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:35.970
REALLY DISRUPTING OUT SPACE-

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.738
COULD YOU HAVE ONE PRODUCT ONE

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.673
TRANSPARENT LOW PRICED-

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:43.010
REGARDING HEALTH PLANS- MOST

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:47.481
INSURED CONSUMERS- HI YOU KNOW

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.918
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE- MOST OF THEM

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.653
AT LEAST WITH GOOD COVERAGE TO

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.355
HAVE- YOUR COPAYS OR COINSURANCE

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:55.723
AMOUNTS THAT THA THEY NEED TO

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:58.392
PAY AND THEN- BUT THE CONSUMERS

01:34:58.459 --> 01:34:59.894
THAT THAT HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.195
HEALTH PLANS WHERE THEY HAVE

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:02.863
BEEN MET THAT DEDUCTIBLE THEY

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:05.366
WOULD ALSO BE- SIMILAR TO THE

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:07.001
UNINSURED CONSUMER HAVING TO

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:09.703
BEAR THE WHOLE COST- BEFORE THEY

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.405
YOU KNOW BEFORE THE HEALTH PLAN

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:14.442
PICKS UP THE REMAINDER. SO FOR

01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:19.213
THESE TWO- TWO GROUPS CONSUMERS-

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.347
IT WOULD BENEFIT THEM. FROM

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:21.882
PROPOSED BY HAVING. ACCESS TO A

01:35:21.949 --> 01:35:23.551
LOW COST PRODUCT THAT THEY THAT

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.886
THEY COULD PAY FOR OUT OF THERE

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.054
ARE USING THEIR OWN OUT OF

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:29.457
POCKET. FUNDS I GUESS WITH THE

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:31.158
CHAIR JUST TO FOLLOW UP AND I

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.993
AND I APOLOGIZE AND I'M PROBABLY

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.662
GETTING WAY INTO THE WEEDS ON

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:38.065
THIS BUT- BUT- BUT I. I YOU KNOW

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:39.333
I WONDER OKAY SO YOU HAVE

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.568
CONSUMERS WHO'S GOT A HEALTH

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:42.870
INSURANCE PLAN- AND PRESUME OF

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:45.005
HIS HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN SHOULD

01:35:45.072 --> 01:35:47.041
BE COVERING- THE COST. OF SOME

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:49.143
OF THE COSTS FOR THE FOR THE FOR

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:50.744
THE DRUG. BUT WE MIGHT WE MIGHT

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.746
ULTIMATELY BE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:53.647
TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR INSURANCE

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:56.383
PLAN. BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOWER

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:59.487
COST ALTERNATIVE. FOR THEM- IT

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.489
WAS NOT QUITE AN OVER THE

01:36:01.555 --> 01:36:02.656
COUNTER BECAUSE IT'S A

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.358
PRESCRIPTION- SO WE'VE GOT THIS

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.826
SOMETHING THAT'S KINDA IN

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:06.760
BETWEEN HERE. MEANWHILE THE

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:09.897
PREMIUM REFLECTS. WHAT THE COST.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.933
SHOULD BE SO THAT'S GIVING AN

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:13.634
ADVANTAGE TO THE INSURANCE

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:16.203
COMPANIES- THE PBMS MAY NOT

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:18.038
CARRY IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.573
GETTING A BIG ENOUGH REBATE.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.642
THERE SO SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:24.879
HERE THAT ARE OF CONCERN- AND I

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.847
YOU KNOW I JUST. I GUESS I'M

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.616
HOPING THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY.

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.317
REALLY LOKING DEEPLY AT THAT

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:31.886
SOME OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:33.554
COMPLICATED. AND I'M JUST

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:36.357
TOUCHING THE SURFACE OF THE

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.459
SENATE AND I THINK YOU KNOW

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:39.426
THAT. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:40.628
WHERE WE'RE CONSIDERING AND

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.563
LOOKING AT EXPLORING FURTHER- WE

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.398
WHAT WE WILL AS PART OF THIS IS

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.167
A NATIONALLY WE WILL BE.

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:48.269
BRINGING ON AN EXPERT CONSULTANT

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.671
TO HELP WITH THE STRATEGIC- WITH

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.940
STRATEGY OPERATIONS- YOU KNOW

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:54.475
IT'S ONE THING TO GET YOUR

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.310
PRODUCT TO MARKET IT'S ANOTHER

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.379
ENTIRE- IT'S ANOTHER SORT OF

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:00.114
CHALLENGE. TO ACTUALLY GET IT IN

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.116
THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS. SO WITH

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.084
THAT AT EXPERT CONSULTANT THEY

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.386
WOULD BE TASKED WITH FIGURING

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.655
OUT STRATEGIES. FOR ENGAGING

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.957
HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS ON ON HOW

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:12.726

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:14.094
ACCENTS ONE PRODUCT. YEAH AND

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:15.863
THEN JUST FINALLY BEGIN I KNOW

WORLD. THAT HAD ARTIFICIALLY IMP

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.004
CREASE THE PRICE OF THEIR

PRODUCT. TO BE ABLE TO APPEAL TO

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:27.942
A PBM TO GET THREE THAT PBM

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:30.844
INTERESTED TO REBATE. SO THEY

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:31.445
COULD ACTUALLY PLAY IN THAT

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.547
SPACE AND SO. THIS IS A REAL

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:36.984

CONTRACTS- AND THAT AS WELL THEY

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:30.104
WERE NOT- FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:32.940
THE PROMISE OF. CHEAPER BECAUSE

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.608
IT ENDED UP BEING THAT WE WERE

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:37.278
PAYING MORE FOR THAT- THE

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.046
COVERAGE HAS INSTEAD OF LEFT.

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:41.949

THROUGH THE VENTURA CONTACTS SO

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.492
IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE TO ME HOW

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.460
WE CAN SAY NO BID CONTRACTS WHEN

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.195
IT'S SUCH A- SENSITIVE ISSUE.

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:57.231
AND TO THE POINT OF THE PBMS

01:38:57.298 --> 01:38:59.333

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.102

BILLS WILL BE PAID FOR AND WHAT

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.210
I HEARD YOU SAY. WAS THAT THE

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.779

ESPECIALLY AGAIN UP TO THE

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.967
DEVELOPMENT STAGE. AND GETTING

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:36.136
THAT ACTED APPROVAL- HOWEVER

01:49:36.202 --> 01:49:38.071
THERE'S- LIKELY GOING TO BE

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:39.372
SEVERAL MORE MILESTONES THAT

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:40.707
NEED TO BE FLUSHED OUT FOR THAT

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:43.443
PROCESS. I'M NOT JUST TO GET TO

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:45.111

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:03.229
MANY MORE STEPS THAT NEED TO GO

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:05.298
IN THE PROCESS THAT- WE THINK

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:07.734
IT. WOULD BE CRITICAL FOR THE

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:08.301
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A GOOD

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:09.803

GETTING A LEGAL REVIEW. FROM THE

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:31.891
ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THERE. A

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.626
RATIONALE FOR WHY WE WOULD NOT

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:35.862
WANT TO DO THIS IN A PUBLIC

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:38.798
SPACE TO ENSURE THE- MOST AMOUNT

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:40.934
OF TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:44.904
THAT WE CAN HAVE. I THINK IT IT

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:46.239
COULD BE DONE TO AN EXTENT IN A

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:48.008
PUBLIC SPACE I MEAN IT WE WON'T

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:49.843

02:05:46.138 --> 02:05:47.506
WILL OUTLINE THE GOALS AND

02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:49.141
OUTCOMES AND TARGETS FOR THIS

02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:51.343
EFFORT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:52.711
OPERATIONAL PROCESSES AND

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:54.980
WORKFLOWS DECIDE ROLES AND

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:56.949
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EFFORT

02:05:57.016 --> 02:05:58.450
AND START TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF

02:05:58.517 --> 02:06:00.252
THE PROJECTS WITHIN THIS EFFORT

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:00.719
WILL BE DEVELOPED AND

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:02.621
IMPLEMENTED. SUBMITTING THIS

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.290
DOCUMENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.658
WILL HELP TO DETERMINE WHETHER

02:06:05.724 --> 02:06:07.192
THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:09.128
EFFORT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.196
MITIGATED AND HOW LONG IT WILL

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:13.165
TAKE TO COMPLETE THIS EFFORT AND

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:14.500
AT WHAT COST. IT IS OUR

02:06:14.566 --> 02:06:15.467
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:17.169
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THIS

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:18.137
LANGUAGE TO BE POTENTIALLY

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:21.206
DUPLICATIVE OF CURRENT BUDGET-BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.541
QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH THE

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:24.443
LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS AS

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:28.714
WELL AS UPDATES ON NEW CONTRACTS-WE THINK MODIFYING THIS LANGUAGE

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.382
TO SPECIFY THAT THE STRATEGY

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.584
DOCUMENTATION MUST BE DELIVERED

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:34.353
BY THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:35.354
WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:37.089
ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLARITY AS

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:41.093
THIS EFFORT MOVES FORWARD. I

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.494
WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:43.329
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE WILL

02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:45.030
BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WHAT. THANK

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:46.131
YOU- FOR THE OVERVIEW ON THIS

02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:48.901
ITEM- I'VE GAINED A LOT OF

02:06:48.968 --> 02:06:49.702
APPRECIATION FOR HOW IMPORTANT

02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:51.170
MODERN AND MODERNIZING

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:53.272
MODERNIZING OUR MEDICAID THEIR

02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:55.441
PRICES SYMBOL MES- IS. FOR

02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:56.976
ABILITY TO ADMINISTER THE

02:06:57.042 --> 02:06:58.544
LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE

02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:01.814
NATION SO QUESTION- CAN M. M. E.

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.516
S. B. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF TO

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:06.251
SUPPORT THE DATA SHARING SIDE OF

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:06.986
CALAMP. I LIKE THINGS LIKE

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:08.520
MAKING SURE THE HEALTH PLANS AND

02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:10.122
PROVIDERS RABAL EXCHANGING USE

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.557
CLINICAL RECORDS AND CLAIMS

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:13.559
DATA. TO PROVIDE WHOLE PERSON

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.127
CARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:17.663
MEDICARE OUR PATIENTS. YEAH

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.365
EXCELLENT QUESTION WE DO HAVE

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:21.533
ARE CHEAPER AS CHIEF INFORMATION

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.068
OFFICER ARE AVAILABLE REMOTELY

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:26.271
CHRIS RECENT COULD ASSIST WITH

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.506
THE THREE. CAN WE HAVE THE CHIEF

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:32.344
INFORMATION OFFICER FOR DH CS.

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:35.881
J. C. K. AS WELL. I GUESS WHAT

02:07:35.948 --> 02:07:37.316
I'M WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE IS

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:40.052
CAN WE ARE WE ARE WE ABLE TO

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:40.586
COMBINE THESE PRIORITIES

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:43.489
TOGETHER THAT THINK THEY ARE.

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:49.461
BOTH IMPORTANT. HEY CHRIS RESEND

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:52.097
IT TO CONFIRMATION OFFICERED ACS

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:55.434
YOU GUYS HEAR ME OKAY. YEAH OKAY

02:07:55.501 --> 02:08:00.239
SO. TO HAVE TO PUT THAT IN

02:08:00.305 --> 02:08:02.674
PERSPECTIVE THAT IT THE MES DOES

02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:04.376
SUPPORT THE ITEMS THAT YOU

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:08.580
BROUGHT UP- AND AS WE GO THROUGH

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:11.016
AND MODERNIZE THIS THE OVERALL

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:12.117
AMERIGAS WHICH IT WHICH

02:08:12.184 --> 02:08:14.753
REPRESENTS ALL OF THE SYSTEMS

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:17.289
THAT SUPPORT MEDICAID INCLUDING

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:20.059
FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE DATA SIDE

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:21.827
THE WAREHOUSE OR THE DATA

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.896
WAREHOUSE AND THE RELATED

02:08:23.962 --> 02:08:26.799
SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE DATA- IT IT

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.901
WILL SUPPORT THAT- CAL AIM

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:31.870
REALLY REPRESENTS MORE OF THE

02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:33.705
BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS- IN THE

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:34.873
CHANGES FROM A POLICY

02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:37.009
PERSPECTIVE AND- ASSOCIATES

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:38.677
SYSTEM CHANGES AND SO WHEN WE

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.712
WORK ON ALL OF THIS WE TAKE THAT

02:08:40.779 --> 02:08:44.016
INTO ACCOUNT. AND THERE WON'T BE

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:47.986
OVER LACK OF EFFORT OCCURRING.

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:50.089
HE SAID IT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OR

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:52.324
CAN YOU CAN DO IT BUT DOESN'T

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:54.059
SOUND LIKE THERE'S A- COMMITMENT

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:55.060
TO ACTUALLY DOING THAT THE

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:57.196
REASON UP I'LL BRING IT UP IS IT

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:59.031
JUST SAVE IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:08:59.098 --> 02:09:00.666
COMBINE THESE ISSUES I THINK

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:01.900
WE'RE MISSING. A UP AN

02:09:01.967 --> 02:09:03.268
OPPORTUNITY- I'M PRESSING ON

02:09:03.335 --> 02:09:05.170
THIS- A LITTLE BIT. LET LEARN

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:07.940
OTHER STATES ARE DRAWN DOWN- IN

02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:10.242
THOSE INCREDIBLY- GENEROUS MES

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:12.644
FUNDS FOR THIS TYPE OF DATA FOR

02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:14.446
THE DATA TAPE DATA SHARING

02:09:14.513 --> 02:09:16.281
INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS THAT.

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:17.616
COULD COULD POTENTIALLY DELIVER

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:20.119
SO THAT YOU CAN DO IT BUT I

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:21.753
DON'T I'M NOT HEARING THAT WE'RE

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:23.789
NECESSARILY GOING TO DO IT-

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:25.691
BECAUSE CAL AT SOAP AND I'VE GOT

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:27.392
SOME NOTES HERE SO I'M GONNA

02:09:27.459 --> 02:09:28.427
READ THIS RATHER THAN SCREWED UP

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:33.665
OKAY. SO BUT- IT DOESN'T APPEAR

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:35.801
THAT CALIFORNIA. WITH FOR SOME

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:38.237
REASON HASN'T PURSUED THIS TYPE

02:09:38.303 --> 02:09:39.771
OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT IT

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:42.141
FEELS LIKE. WE DO THIS MAYBE ADD

02:09:42.207 --> 02:09:47.179
ON LATER ON BUT NOT BUT PUT IT

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:48.413
ALL TOGETHER AND MY MISSING

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.516
SOMETHING THERE. I'M NOT EFFORTS

02:09:50.582 --> 02:09:52.084
I'M NOT TAKING ISSUE WITH THE B.

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:53.285
C. P. I MORE TAKING I'M MORE

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:54.753
WANT TO KNOW IS THIS A

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:55.354
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OR WE

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:57.122
GONNA START WITH SOMETHING AND

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:58.490
TRY TO ADD. ADD SOMETHING ON

02:09:58.557 --> 02:09:59.558
BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK

02:09:59.625 --> 02:10:01.960
OUT GREAT. YES WHAT'S THE LET'S

02:10:02.027 --> 02:10:02.995
TALK ABOUT WHAT THE STRATEGY IS

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:05.297
THAT WE USE THAT I'M LAURIE AND

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:06.665
BRIAN WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:10.369
EARLIER. SO THE OVERALL STRATEGY

02:10:10.435 --> 02:10:12.404
FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES

02:10:12.471 --> 02:10:14.907
ENHANCEMENTS IMPROVEMENTS- AT

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.575
TIMES MAYBE REPLACEMENT OF

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:20.445
SYSTEMS. IN THE END THE **** IS

02:10:20.512 --> 02:10:22.314
ONE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:25.150
OVER TIME SO WHAT WE DELIVER. AT

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.552
THE END OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY

02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:28.987
THREE IS VERY IS REALLY THE

02:10:29.054 --> 02:10:32.157
INITIAL- STRATEGY AND ROADMAP

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:33.492
BUT REALLY WHAT ALL OF THIS

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:35.227
REPRESENTS IS AN UNDERSTANDING

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:37.663
OF BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW WE

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:39.831
DO MODERNIZATION OF THE SYSTEMS.

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:42.834
IT'S ALL BASED AND- AND IT'S ALL

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.736
BASED ON BUSINESS PRIORITIES

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:47.706
THAT WILL BE SET BY CAL AMY AND

02:10:47.773 --> 02:10:49.942
THEIR EFFORTS. THAT WILL DRIVE

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:52.578
THE BUSINESS PRIORITIES THAT

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:53.745
GETS TRANSLATED INTO AN

02:10:53.812 --> 02:10:55.480
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PARTS OF

02:10:55.547 --> 02:10:57.049
THE M. YES WE NEED TO MODERNIZE

02:10:57.115 --> 02:11:00.586
pAND WEBER. AND SO WHEN I SAY CAN

02:11:00.652 --> 02:11:02.888
I GUESS WHAT I MEAN IS THAT

02:11:02.955 --> 02:11:05.023
THOSE PRIORITIES THAT GETS THAT

02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:08.727
BY- THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:10.329
ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF WHERE

02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:12.097
WE'RE GOING WITH MEDIC COW WILL

02:11:12.164 --> 02:11:14.233
WILL WILL DRIVE THE ROAD MAP.

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:15.300
THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:17.903
EARLIER AND ALL OF THAT COMES

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:19.571
TOGETHER AND CONTINUES TO EVOLVE

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:21.206
OVER TIME AS THOSE BUSINESS

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:24.343
PRIORITIES CONTINUE TO CHANGE OR

02:11:24.409 --> 02:11:28.046
BE UPDATED- AND SO. ALL OF THE

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.848
SO AND I DON'T KNOW THE DETAIL

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:32.718
IN TERMS OF THE- SPECIFICS OF

02:11:32.784 --> 02:11:35.020
THE DATA THAT YOUR THINKING

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:37.990
ABOUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT IT

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.758
DOES ALL TIED TOGETHER AND WE

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:41.460
WILL BE WORKING ON THESE THINGS

02:11:41.526 --> 02:11:43.362
IN FACT TO DATE IS ONE OF THE

02:11:43.428 --> 02:11:45.230
KEY ASPECTS OF WHAT UNDERLIES

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:49.201
THE. ENTIRE AND THE S. AND

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:51.303
ALLOWS US TO BE A TO THE WORK

02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:53.272
THAT WE PLAN TO DO TO MODERNIZE

02:11:53.338 --> 02:11:54.873
. SO IT SO SOUNDS LIKE A FIVE

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:56.375
STAR SO SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN DO

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:58.343
THIS BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

02:11:58.410 --> 02:12:00.445
IS. AT I'M ACTUALLY I COULD ASK

02:12:00.512 --> 02:12:01.713
KIND OF ASKING CAN THE

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.315
ADMINISTRATION TO BE BOLDER

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:06.585
ABOUT THIS AND TRY TO- HE CAN DO

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.687
IT HE SAID THEY CAN DO IT YEAH

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:11.056
BUT CAN THE IS THERE A WILL TO

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:12.591
DO AND THE REASON IS A LOOK I'M

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:14.793
SPONSORING A NINETY FIVE MILLION

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:15.961
DOLLARS- SHOULD. HAVE DATA

02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:16.862
SHARED EQUITY- PACKAGE FOR MEDIC

02:12:16.928 --> 02:12:18.597
CAL ON BEHALF OF A LARGE

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:20.699
COALITION OF PLANS AND PROVIDERS

02:12:20.766 --> 02:12:21.667
AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.568
AND SO. A LARGE PART OF THE

02:12:23.635 --> 02:12:25.871
PACKAGE A ISSUES AND YES TO

02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:28.373
SUPPORT- H. I. EASE AND THE DATA

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.475
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CALAMP-

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:31.310
FORGET MY CARE MANAGEMENT

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:33.378
POPULATION HEALTH AND SO ON SO

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:35.547
YES WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS. IS

02:12:35.614 --> 02:12:39.351
THERE A WILL. TO LEVERAGE. HUGE

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:40.786
POTENTIAL FEDERAL MATCHES IN

02:12:40.852 --> 02:12:43.855
THIS- IN AND TAKE A BOLD STEP IN

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:46.124
THAT DIRECTION OR- ARE WE GONNA

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.426
JUST KIND OF BUILD THIS THING

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:49.761
AND LITTLE PIECES AND HOPE IT

02:12:49.828 --> 02:12:50.929
ALL COMES TOGETHER AND FUNCTIONS

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:53.932
THE WAY. WE WANTED TO- SO YOU

STAKEHOLDERS EVERYONE TO REALLY

02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:01.273
TALK ABOUT THIS. MAYBE A BOLDER

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.343
APPROACH- THAT WE COULD TAKE

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.610
ADVANTAGE OF THINGS UP FRONT.

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:08.847
COMPREHENSIVELY INSTEAD OF. YOU

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:11.316
KNOW BUILDING THAT KIND OF AS WE

02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:13.385
GO ALONG YEAH I THINK WOULD

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:14.486
CHRIS IS MENTIONING IS THERE'S

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:16.054
BEEN SO MANY CHANGES IN MEDICARE

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:17.389
ALL RIGHT I THINK WE ARE TRYING

02:13:17.456 --> 02:13:19.691
TO USE THIS PROCESS TO IDENTIFY

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:21.493
LINK. CALLEVA IS A CORE

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.261
COMPONENT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:25.230
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE WE HAVE

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:28.667
MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THAT PLAY IN

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:29.935
TWO TO THAT SIDE OF THINGS-

02:13:30.001 --> 02:13:31.436
THROUGH THIS WORK WE'RE HOPING

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:32.637
TO KIND OF IDENTIFY HOW DO WE

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.139
MODERNIZE THOSE SYSTEMS SO THEY

02:13:34.206 --> 02:13:36.108
ARE. MORE EFFICIENT SO THAT

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:37.242
COUNTIES ARE ENTERING INTO

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:38.677
MULTIPLE WAYS USING MULTIPLE

02:13:38.744 --> 02:13:40.379
SYSTEMS TO TRACK ALL THE

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:41.847
DIFFERENT FUNDS WHETHER IT'S OUR

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.582
MEDIC HALLER AND THEY JUST SAY

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.117
OR THE BLOCK GRANTS THERE'S

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:46.518
LITERALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS FOR

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:48.887
THOSE AND SO I THINK. I THINK

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:50.655
THE UNDERLYING THAT IS. THE GOAL

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:52.391
OF WHAT CHRIS'S OUTLINING CALLIN

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:53.892
AS ONE OF THE LARGE OPPONENTS IN

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:55.127
ADDITION TO OTHER THINGS IN THE

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:57.662
DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE A PART

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:58.296
OF THAT PROCESS. I WOULD ALSO

02:13:58.363 --> 02:14:00.298
NOTE THAT- THE POPULATION HEALTH

02:14:00.365 --> 02:14:01.199
MANAGEMENT SERVICE THAT WAS

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:03.969
APPROVED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:04.569
WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY A HUGE

02:14:04.636 --> 02:14:06.104
IMPROVEMENT WHICH WERE HOPING TO

02:14:06.171 --> 02:14:08.106
LAUNCH IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.374
WE'RE WILL BE USING ALL OF OUR

02:14:09.441 --> 02:14:11.109
AT LEAST ADMINISTRATIVE DATA.

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:13.211
DATA FROM SISTER DPARTMENTS

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.546
INTO THE SYSTEM FOR PLANTS

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:16.248
PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES TO

02:14:16.314 --> 02:14:18.250
BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO

02:14:18.316 --> 02:14:19.551
THEIR MEDICAL SERVICES.

02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:21.086
ULTIMATELY THE FUTURE WE'D ALSO

02:14:21.153 --> 02:14:23.722
LIKE TO TIE INTO THAT- YOU KNOW

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.624
A CLINICAL DATA THROUGH H. I.

02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:27.292
USE AND OTHERS ON THAT MAY HAVE

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:29.561
TO BE A PHASE TWO BUT IT'S IN

02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:31.096
THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT WE WANT

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:32.898
TO PULL INTO. A INTO THE-THE

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:34.866
SERVICE IN THE FUTURE IN WE ARE

02:14:34.933 --> 02:14:36.201
DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR

02:14:36.268 --> 02:14:37.436
THAT INITIATIVE WE'RE GOING

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.037
THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND

02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.872
THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THIS

02:14:40.939 --> 02:14:41.640
LARGER STRUCTURE. THAT CHRIS AND

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.175
HIS TEAM ARE LEADING IN REGARDS

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:45.010
TO HOW DO WE LEVEL OUT SOME OF

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:48.013
OUR SYSTEMS AND YOU KNOW ABILITY

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.848
TO PULL THAT DATA IN. YOU KNOW

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:51.216
MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ALL THE

02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:53.151
RIGHT PEOPLE- AND SO HAPPY TO

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:54.553
KIND OF CONTINUE THESE

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:55.454
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AS YOU'RE

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:57.522
LOOKING AT THE BEST WAYS THAT WE

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:58.123
CAN MAXIMIZE THE DATA THAT WE

02:14:58.190 --> 02:15:01.059
HAVE. ACROSS ALL OF MEDICAL. SO

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:02.661
SOUNDS LIKE WHEN I'M- AT THE

02:15:02.727 --> 02:15:06.264
BOLD APPROACH I'M LOOKING FOR

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.499
PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IS GOING A.

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:09.034
B. FACED. POTENTIAL I WOULD

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.435
IMAGINE IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:12.838
PHASE BUT I WILL DEFER TO KRISTA

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:13.472
IN REGARDS TO UNDERSTAND ONE OF

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:14.606
TRAFFIC CONCEPTUALLY LOOK

02:15:14.673 --> 02:15:15.774
THERE'S FEDERAL FUNDING OUT

02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:17.542
THERE WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE AS

02:15:17.609 --> 02:15:19.244
MUCH AS WE CAN WORK AND SO WE

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.545
HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:21.580
APPROACH THAT FEELS LIKE WE

02:15:21.646 --> 02:15:24.282
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THAT

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:25.517
FUNDING A LITTLE EASIER THAN.

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:27.686
YOU KNOW. ADDING ON MODULES AS

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:29.387
WE GO FORWARD I JUST THAT'S

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:30.489
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS

02:15:30.555 --> 02:15:32.557
YES THAT I DON'T KNOW. THE L. A.

02:15:32.624 --> 02:15:34.259
O. HAVE COMMENTS ON THAT YOU

02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:35.694
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YO

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.066
KNOW WHAT TOUCH THAT ONE. COME

02:15:41.132 --> 02:15:44.202
ON PEOPLE. NO I THINK I THINK IT

02:15:44.269 --> 02:15:45.637
SPEAKS TO OUR AND BIOMETRIC

02:15:45.704 --> 02:15:46.404
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.206
AGAIN SPEAKS OUR RECOMMENDATION

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:49.975
ABOUT THE NEED TO DELIVER THIS

02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:51.109
INITIAL STRATEGY TO THE

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:53.411
LEGISLATURE. SUCH THAT I CAN

02:15:53.478 --> 02:15:55.280
UNDERSTAND WHAT. THE GOALS THE

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:57.048
OUTCOMES THE TARGETS FOR THIS

02:15:57.115 --> 02:15:59.284
OVERALL PROCESS ARE. SUCH THAT

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:01.786
IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE OTHER

02:16:01.853 --> 02:16:02.420
COMPONENTS. SUCH AS SAID YOU

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:03.588
KNOW DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.124
AT DATA DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:07.225
ADVANTAGE OF- KIND OF. THE DATA

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:08.326
LED EFFORTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:11.062
UNDERWAY. IT COULD BE DISCUSSED

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:13.265
AS PART OF A- OF A LARGER. KIND

02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:14.833
OF STRATEGY DOCUMENT THAT THEY

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:18.370
PLAN ON HAVING AVAILABLE BY THE

02:16:18.436 --> 02:16:20.438
END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. YEAH I

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:22.474
GUESS IS THE CHIP CHALLENGES I

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:23.608
MEAN WE OFTEN SO YOU KNOW WE

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.544
OFTEN START ON THESE INITIATIVES

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:26.444
AND WE DON'T COSTARRED

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:27.746
COLLECTING THE DATA SOON ENOUGH

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:28.547
OR WE DON'T SOMETIMES. OUR

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.148
PROGRAMS WE KNOW OF THAT ARE

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:31.349
COLLECTING DATA OR COLLECTING

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:32.284
DATA NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.185
THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW FOR ME I'M

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:35.453
THINKING CAN WE NOT COLLECT THE

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:39.391
DATA REAL TIME USE IT AND HELP

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:40.892
TO- YOU KNOW MAKE THE SYSTEM

02:16:40.959 --> 02:16:42.727
MAKE THINGS WORK IN A MORE

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:43.929
ROBUST AWAY. RATHER THAN GETTING

02:16:43.995 --> 02:16:46.131
IT STARTED THEN IN DO YOU SEE

02:16:46.197 --> 02:16:48.333
WHERE I'M GOING OR I DON'T. YEAH

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.970
I HOPE I HOPE SO I JUST. IT'S

02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:53.171
FIVE I JUST FEEL IT JUST FEELS

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:54.806
MORE STRATEGIC AND IN THE LONG

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.541
RUN AND POTENTIALLY MORE-

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.877
BENEFICIAL- AS BRING. ABLE TO

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:01.379
ANALYZE THAT DATA AS AS WE'RE

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:05.016
GETTING IT RATHER THAN WAITING.

02:17:05.083 --> 02:17:07.686
AND ADDING TO IT. ALL OF THIS

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.588
AND I'M GOING TO GET THAT MEANS

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.523
WAY LOWER. WAS SPEAKING TO AND

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.758
HER OPENING NOTES WHICH IS.

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:16.595
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. OUR INTENT

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:19.230
IS TO DELIVER THIS OVER TIME AND

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:21.099
DO IT IN AN INCREMENTAL FASHION

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:23.969
WHERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:26.638
BOTH THE MODERNIZE SYSTEM THAT

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:28.640
WE PUT IN PLACE AND ALSO THE

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:31.109
DATA THAT MAY BE TIED TO IT- SO

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:33.144
THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:35.513
ALL OF THAT. EARLY AND OFTEN AS

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:39.017
OPPOSED TO. WAITING FOR TEN

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:41.920
YEARS TO DEVELOP. A NEW SYSTEM

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:44.089
THAT ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING THAT

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:46.024
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THAT

02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:47.692
THAT SORT OF APPROACH DOESN'T

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:48.960
PROVIDE US VALUE WHEN WE'RE

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:52.430
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING AS LARGE

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:54.933
AS THE MES. WHAT APPROACH GETS

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:55.500
AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROP

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:56.568
BROWN'S MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING AS

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.870
WE CAN THAT'S WHAT I'M AFTER IT.

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:01.072
AND THAT'S WHAT ON I WILL SAY

02:18:01.139 --> 02:18:02.707
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH THESE

02:18:02.774 --> 02:18:06.077
EFFORTS RIGHT WE MAXIMIZE NINETY

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:10.682
TEN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF. THIS

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:14.819
EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN.

02:18:14.886 --> 02:18:15.854
EIGHT AND JUST SO THAT WE'RE

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:19.624
CLEAR- WERE UTILIZING FEDERAL

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.960
FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT. THEIR

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:23.762
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE OTHER

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:25.163
PROJECTS IN THE STATE AND THAT

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:28.400
SAME WAY SO THERE IS A VERY.

02:18:28.466 --> 02:18:31.136
GOOD EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:33.238
OF FEDERAL FUNDS WHERE WE CAN TO

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:36.808
SUPPORT. THE MES AND THE

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:40.879
MODERNIZATION OF THEM YES. OKAY

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:43.181
THANK YOU THANK YOU I WILL BRING

02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:45.817
IT UP TO THE CHAIR AND I WILL

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:47.052
FOLLOW UP JUST BECAUSE I.

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:49.020
BELIEVE IT WARRANTS IT EARLIER

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:51.156
YOU SAID THAT THE STRATEGY ON

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:56.194
MODERNIZATION. JUST RECENTLY

02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:57.762
SAID THAT WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.898
FEDERAL. FUNDS THAT WE PULL

02:18:59.964 --> 02:19:02.534
DOWN. DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.170
WHEN OR WHEN. FEDERAL MONEY IS

02:19:05.236 --> 02:19:08.306
NOT. OR IT IS AVAILABLE FOR US.

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:11.576
INTO WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE.

02:19:11.643 --> 02:19:18.049
UNDERTAKING CERTAIN PROJECTS. DO

02:19:18.116 --> 02:19:20.585
YOU MEAN ARE WE MAKING DECISIONS

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:22.420
THAT'S CORRECT DO YOU MAKE

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:23.354
DECISIONS BASED ON WHETHER OR

02:19:23.421 --> 02:19:26.558
NOT- YOU GET IT 90% FEDERAL

02:19:26.624 --> 02:19:30.061
MATCH DOES THAT THEN CHANGE OUR

02:19:30.128 --> 02:19:32.731
ABILITY TO CREATE A STRATEGY.

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:34.365
WELL IT IT WON'T IT WON'T CHANGE

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:35.600
YOUR ABILITY TO CREATE THE

02:19:35.667 --> 02:19:39.537
STRATEGY AND I WILL SAY- GETTING

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:41.840
FOR EXAMPLE THE NINETY TEN MATCH

02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:44.676
FROM FROM CMS FROM OUR FEDERAL

02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:47.445
PARTNERS. ONE MORE JEWISH IT

02:19:47.512 --> 02:19:50.148
PROJECTS. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:52.784
CHALLENGING IT CAN BECOME

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:55.019
CHALLENGING WHEN WE ARE FOR

02:19:55.086 --> 02:19:57.222
EXAMPLE TRYING TO DO A PROJECT

02:19:57.288 --> 02:19:58.256
THAT IS BUILDING SOMETHING

02:19:58.323 --> 02:20:00.759
THAT'S TO CLICK IT IS A BIG OF

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:02.527
ANOTHER PROJECT AND WE'VE SEEN

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:04.996
THIS A FACT- WITHIN CALIFORNIA

02:20:05.063 --> 02:20:07.532
WINE CMS. GAVE US SPECIFIC

02:20:07.599 --> 02:20:10.602
DIRECTION AROUND THE STATE ARMY

02:20:10.668 --> 02:20:12.670
WELFARE SYSTEMS RIGHT CAL SAWS

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:15.173
AND DIRECTED US TO GET TO A

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:17.375
SINGLE SYSTEM RIGHT SO THEY

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:18.977
DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.845
FUNCTIONALITY MULTIPLE TIMES ARE

02:20:20.912 --> 02:20:22.714
DUPLICATE SYSTEMS THEY WANT PAY

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:24.315
ONCE. BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:26.551
MEETING THEIR ACT THOSE SORTS OF

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:28.586
EXPECTATIONS GETTING NINETY TEN

02:20:28.653 --> 02:20:30.488
FUNDING FOR THESE IT PROJECTS IS

02:20:30.555 --> 02:20:32.457
NOT IS NOT REALLY WHERE THE

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:33.625
CHALLENGE LIES IT'S REALLY IN

02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:35.160
THE DOING OF THE PROJECTS

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.528
BECAUSE THEY'RE LARGE AND

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:39.697
COMPLEX- AND SO. THAT THE

02:20:39.764 --> 02:20:44.302
STRATEGY. ITSELF WON'T. ONE NEXT

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:45.937
. TOUCHING ON BACK BECAUSE IT'S

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:47.305
REALLY ABOUT THE VISIT

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:48.706
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:50.008
PRIORITIES AND HOW WE'RE GOING

02:20:50.074 --> 02:20:51.643
TO MEET THOSE AND HOW THE

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:53.211
SYSTEMS GET MODERNIZED. AS WE

02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:55.380
BEGIN TO TACKLE EACH PART THAT'S

02:20:55.446 --> 02:20:56.614
WHEN WE REALLY APPROACH THE

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:59.417
FUNDING BECAUSE CMS ALSO LOOKS

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:01.786
AT EVERY ALL OF THIS FROM A VERY

02:21:01.853 --> 02:21:03.655
MODULAR VIEW. AND SO THEY WANT

02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:05.423
TO BROKEN DOWN INTO PIECES AND

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:06.891
THEY FIND IT BASED UPON THOSE

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:09.093
SMALLER PIECES BUT IS THAT YEAH

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.695
BUT IF YOU HAD MORE FUNDING

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:12.463
COULD YOU THEN DO MORE PIECES.

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:14.666
DOESN'T THAT CHANGE OUR STRATEGY

02:21:14.732 --> 02:21:15.300
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:17.101
TRYING TO GET OUT HERE. CAN YOU

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:19.037
ADVANCE FASTER IF WE'RE PULLING

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:21.739
DOWN 90% FEDERAL MATCH AND WHY

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:25.476
ARE WE NOT MAXIMIZING THAT IN AN

02:21:25.543 --> 02:21:27.712
ATTEMPT TO. HAVE THE CHANGE WE

02:21:27.779 --> 02:21:32.350
KNOW NEEDS TO HAPPEN- SEE A

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.451
PROBLEM WITH THOSE FEDERAL

02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:36.154
DOLLARS. ALL THE PROJECTS IN

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:38.423
THERE AND THE MES MODERNIZATION

02:21:38.489 --> 02:21:41.292
ARE NINETY TAX. SO WE ARE

02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:43.228
PULLING DOWN NINETY TENANTS

02:21:43.294 --> 02:21:45.630
FUNDING IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ALL

02:21:45.697 --> 02:21:46.798
OF THIS AND WE EXPECT TO

02:21:46.865 --> 02:21:48.900
CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT I ALSO

02:21:48.967 --> 02:21:50.568
THINK THERE'S A CERTAIN CAPACITY

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:53.338
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY-

02:21:53.404 --> 02:21:56.140
SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE ON AND I

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:57.542
DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY BASED

02:21:57.609 --> 02:21:59.844
UPON. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING OR

02:21:59.911 --> 02:22:02.614
THE NINETY TEN FUNDING IT'S THAT

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:03.214
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:08.052
CHANGE THAT. WE ALL ARE ABLE TO

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:10.688
. EXECUTE AT ONE TIMEWELL WE

02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:12.190
HAVE TO DO IT BASED UPON

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:14.893
BUSINESS AND PROGRAM PRIORITIES

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:16.861
AND SO WE'RE REALLY BILL HOLD ON

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.596
THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE RIGHT WE'RE

02:22:18.663 --> 02:22:20.365
REALLY BEHOLDEN TO THE CHANGES

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:22.634
THAT. ARE REPRESENTED WHETHER

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:25.270
THROUGH A LAME OR OTHER YOU KNOW

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:28.740
PROGRAM EFFORTS- AND THE DRIVING

02:22:28.806 --> 02:22:31.910
OF THOSE IN ORDER TO DO THIS

02:22:31.976 --> 02:22:33.912
WORK- I DON'T THINK USING AN

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:35.546
ANALOGY IT SEEMS THAT YOU'RE OUT

02:22:35.613 --> 02:22:37.815
BAND WITH FOUR OF THE CAPACITY

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:39.951
OF CHANGED NOW. AND THAT

02:22:40.018 --> 02:22:42.320
INCREASED RESOURCES WOULD NOT

02:22:42.387 --> 02:22:44.555
LEAD TOWARDS INCREASED CHANGE IS

02:22:44.622 --> 02:22:48.760
THAT. THE CORRECT SUMMATION OF

02:22:48.826 --> 02:22:50.228
WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I DON'T KNOW

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:51.596
THAT WE'RE NECESSARILY IT IS THE

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:53.998
RIGHT NOW WHERE WHERE WE'RE AT

02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:55.967
IS THAT. WE SPENT THE LAST

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:57.669
COUPLE YEARS BRINGING TOGETHER

02:22:57.735 --> 02:22:59.370
VARIOUS MODERNIZATION PROJECTS

02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:00.838
IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORE

02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:02.607
ENTERPRISE APPROACH OR AN

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:04.309
APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:05.743
THE BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.111
M. S. SOME OF WHAT WE WERE

02:23:07.178 --> 02:23:09.480
TALKING TOUCHING ONEARLIER. AND

NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WORK

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:13.651
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO BUILD THE

02:23:13.718 --> 02:23:15.486

US TO- ALSO BETTER UNDERSTAND

02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:20.291
MAYBE WHAT THAT CAPACITY IS THAT

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:21.526
YOU'RE TOUCHING ON. AND

ON ALL OF THE CHANGES IT'S A

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:28.433
LARGE AND COMPLEX SYSTEM TO DO

I WAS MOVED ON PAGE FIFTY SEVEN

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:08.145
OF THE AGENDA- THAT. IT STATES

02:28:08.212 --> 02:28:10.648
THAT THE PENDING CASE. ACTIONS

WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION TO

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:31.469
DO THIS WORK AND WE HEARD IT WAS

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:32.903
A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION

02:28:32.970 --> 02:28:34.905
I BELIEVE. THAT THE COUNTIES

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:36.874
RECEIVED LAST YEAR IT FOR

02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:38.442
ESTIMATING THERE ARE THREE

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:41.412
MILLION BENEFICIARIES WHO COULD

02:28:41.479 --> 02:28:43.214
GO INTO THE REDETERMINATION

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:46.484
PROCESS. IS FIFTY DOLLARS

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:50.388
ANOTHER PER BENEFICIARY FOR US

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:52.657
TO. B. ENSURING THAT WE'RE DOING

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:54.859
EVERYTHING WE CAN HELP HOW DO WE

02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:57.295
ENSURE SO ALL WE ARE AT THE

02:28:57.361 --> 02:28:59.597
RIGHT NUMBER STARTED- I'LL START

02:28:59.664 --> 02:29:01.499
AND THEN RENEE MULLIN A BILL TO

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:02.600
JUMP INSIDE ACTUALLY IF A

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:03.534
CORRECT THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.369
HAVE TO DO. REDETERMINATION ON

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:07.405
ALL FOURTEEN POINT WHAT NOW IS

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:09.340
SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE- IN THE

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:12.743
PROGRAM- WE ARE OUR CURRENT EX

02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:15.012
PARTE PERCENT IS AROUND 36%

02:29:15.079 --> 02:29:17.515
ACTUALLY DECREASED WITH COVETED-

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:19.383
AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT A

02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:20.985
NUMBER OF FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:22.119
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW US

02:29:22.186 --> 02:29:23.821
TO INCREASE THAT. STILL HAVING

02:29:23.888 --> 02:29:24.855
CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHAT THOSE

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:26.190
WOULD LOOK LIKE WE PLAN ON

02:29:26.257 --> 02:29:27.925
RELEASING IN MID MAY-

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:29.360
COMPREHENSIVE ON WINDING

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:31.395
APPROACH- FOR PEOPLE TO

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:33.531
UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE

02:29:33.597 --> 02:29:34.198
APPROACHING THIS- ESSENTIALLY SO

02:29:34.265 --> 02:29:36.334
WE WOULD WANT TO GET AS MANY AS

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:37.601
WE CAN THROUGH THAT EXPERT TAKE

02:29:37.668 --> 02:29:38.536
PROCESS. WITHOUT HAVING TO THEN

02:29:38.602 --> 02:29:41.539
DO REDETERMINATION- I THINK- WE

02:29:41.605 --> 02:29:42.840
ARE ANTICIPATING THAT ANYWHERE

02:29:42.907 --> 02:29:45.576
FROM TWO TO THREE MILLION THOUGH

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:46.777
CURRENTLY WITHIN IT WILL RESULT

02:29:46.844 --> 02:29:49.246
IN NOT BEING- POTENTIALLY

02:29:49.313 --> 02:29:51.716
STAYING ON THE PROGRAM. I DO TOO

02:29:51.782 --> 02:29:52.817
AT SOME POINT DEPENDING ON THE

02:29:52.883 --> 02:29:54.185
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS WE

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.754
GET HAVE ANYWHERE YOU KNOW AS A

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.356
LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL

02:29:58.422 --> 02:30:00.057
HAVE TO GO THROUGH BUT AS YOU

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:01.392
KNOW IT BUT SIZEABLE NUMBER THAT

02:30:01.459 --> 02:30:03.928
WE THINK WON'T MOVE FORWARD- FOR

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.496
NUMBER OF REASONS PEOPLE WHO

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:08.132
HAVE HAD AT THREE- IN ROMANS NOT

02:30:08.199 --> 02:30:09.300
TAKE PLACE AT THE POINT OF

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:11.001
TOUCH- THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.670
NUMBER OF YEARS WITHOUT RE

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:13.270
DETERMINING INCOME AND OTHER

02:30:13.337 --> 02:30:15.106
PIECES. I WE ALSO KNOW

02:30:15.172 --> 02:30:16.207
SIGNIFICAN NUMBER HAVE EITHER

02:30:16.273 --> 02:30:18.209
HAD HEALTH COVERAGE ALREADY- AS

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:19.410
WE'VE HAD THAT INFORMATION AS

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:21.579
WELL SO I THINK WE DO ANTICIPATE

02:30:21.645 --> 02:30:23.147
A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OVERTIME

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:25.149
OVER THE FULL TWELVE PLUS AT THE

02:30:25.216 --> 02:30:27.184
WE FOURTEEN TOTAL- MONTHS A

02:30:27.251 --> 02:30:31.055
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:32.156
REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT CASE

02:30:32.223 --> 02:30:34.091
LAW THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE SAFE.

02:30:34.158 --> 02:30:35.993
IN REAL. TO BE UPDATING US ON

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:37.962
WHETHER OR THE COUNTIES ARE

02:30:38.028 --> 02:30:41.132
APPROPRIATELY RESOURCE. I JUST

02:30:41.198 --> 02:30:43.534
HAVE CONCERNS WHEN THERE ARE. SO

02:30:43.601 --> 02:30:45.936
MANY. PATIENTS POTENTIALLY WHO

02:30:46.003 --> 02:30:47.571
COULD LOSE THEIR INSURANCE THIS

02:30:47.638 --> 02:30:49.173
NEXT YEAR. THE WE'RE DOING ALL

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:51.175
WE CAN IN ADVANCE YEAH I WOULD

02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:52.810
LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THAT STRATEGY

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:54.078
OR PLAN LOOKS LIKE SO- WE

02:30:54.145 --> 02:30:55.212
ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO SEEK AN

02:30:55.279 --> 02:30:56.747
APPROVED. I GOT APPROVAL FROM

02:30:56.814 --> 02:30:58.048
CMS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:30:58.115 --> 02:30:59.250
EMERGENCY THAT WE WILL HAVE TO

02:30:59.316 --> 02:31:00.918
TOUCH EACH APPLICATION THREE

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.420
TIMES WE WILL ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH

02:31:02.486 --> 02:31:04.522
IT ONCE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ID

02:31:04.588 --> 02:31:05.890
WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL BECAUSE

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:06.490
OTHERWISE THE WORKLOAD WOULD

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:08.359
HAVE BEEN. SUBSTANTIAL FOR THE

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:10.394
COUNTIES- WE ORIGINALLY DID THE

02:31:10.461 --> 02:31:11.896
ESTIMATE KNOWING THAT. WE WOULD

02:31:11.962 --> 02:31:13.531
HAVE TO DO ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:15.266
TWO PLUS TOUCHES AND SO I

02:31:15.332 --> 02:31:16.734
CURRENTLY WORK CONTINUE TO WORK

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:18.402
WITH THE COUNTIES ON WHAT IS

02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:19.437
THAT RIGHT AMOUNT- YOU KNOW. IN

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:21.005
OUR TOUCH RENEE COULD PROBABLY

02:31:21.071 --> 02:31:22.573
TALK MORE IF SHE'S AVAILABLE IN

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:24.074
REGARDS TO HOW DO WE- USE

02:31:24.141 --> 02:31:25.709
TYPICAL STANDARD METHODOLOGIES

02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:27.311
FOR TOUCHES IN REGARDS TO HOW WE

02:31:27.378 --> 02:31:28.679
ESTIMATE THE COUNTY WORK BASED

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:30.448
ON KIND OF. THE WITH A CASE

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:32.216
STUDY AND OR TIME STUDY INTO

02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:33.284
THOSE PIECES. SO I THINK THOSE

02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:35.286
ARE THE BIGGEST PIECES THE OTHER

02:31:35.352 --> 02:31:35.953
THING IS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:38.189
IS X. EXPECTING A STANDARDIZED

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:40.357
REPORT TO THEM AS WELL- WE WILL

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:42.593
ALSO HAVE A STATE. LOOK AT THAT

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:44.128
WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE EVERY

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:45.262
SINGLE MONTH WHICH WILL INCLUDE.

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:47.298
WHAT IS OUR PERCENT OF EX PARTE

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:48.332
HOW MANY RENEWALS ARE OUT HOW

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:50.301
MANY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND HOW

02:31:50.367 --> 02:31:51.602
MANY HAVE BEEN DISTANT ROLLED.

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:53.737
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN BETA TESTING

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:54.271
THE REPORTS ALREADY- IN

02:31:54.338 --> 02:31:55.339
ANTICIPATION OF WHEN THE PUBLIC

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:57.141
HEALTH EMERGENCY AND SO THAT WE

02:31:57.208 --> 02:31:58.175

02:31:58.242 --> 02:31:59.877
REPORTING AND BE TRANSPARENT TO

WHERE WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE. MAYBE

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:06.050
NOT RESPOND SO WE ARE TRYING TO

02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:07.218
BE PROACTIVE IN THAT WAY. I

02:32:07.284 --> 02:32:08.719
WOULD APPRECIATE IF WE COULD

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:12.389
HAVE COUNTY LEVEL DATA AS WELL. HAVE THE POTENTIAL THAN TO BE

02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:13.557

JANUARY FUTURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:53.175
PROPOSAL WE NOTED THAT IT LACKED

02:55:53.242 --> 02:55:55.011
AN OVER ARCHING A KEY STRATEGY.

02:55:55.077 --> 02:55:57.313
AND THIS PROPOSAL DOES- FILL

02:55:57.380 --> 02:56:00.383
THAT GAP- WE ALSO KNOW THE

02:56:00.449 --> 02:56:01.617
PROPOSAL DOES LOOK PROMISING IT

02:56:01.684 --> 02:56:03.753
FOCUSES ON CREATING SORT OF A

02:56:03.819 --> 02:56:04.954
COMPREHENSIVE DATA AND

HEALTH COMPLETE WITH LEADERSHIP

02:56:09.325 --> 02:56:10.993
TO STRIP TO THINK STRATEGICALLY

02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:12.628
ABOUT DATA AND I. T. NEEDS AND

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:16.265
USES- WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A

02:56:16.332 --> 02:56:17.533
FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:20.770
CONSIDERATION- I HAVE A FEW THAT

02:56:20.836 --> 02:56:22.238
ARE. SORT OF HIGH LEVEL AND THEN

02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:24.974
WE HAVE A FEW THAT ARE- SORT OF

02:56:25.041 --> 02:56:26.709
SPECIFIC TO THE COMPONENTS OF

02:56:26.776 --> 02:56:29.378
THE OF THE B. C. P. THE HIGH

02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:30.813
LEVEL COMMENTS PRIMARILY

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:32.715
CONCERNED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

02:56:32.782 --> 02:56:33.916
TO HELP ENSURE THAT THIS

02:56:33.983 --> 02:56:37.420
MODERNIZATION OF DATA AND I. T.

02:56:37.486 --> 02:56:39.422
SYSTEMS IS SUCCESSFUL. SO FIRST

02:56:39.488 --> 02:56:41.857
I WOULD SUGGEST REPORTING- IN

02:56:41.924 --> 02:56:43.759
OUR SYSTEM AND OF THE FUTURE OF

02:56:43.826 --> 02:56:45.294
PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH PROPOSAL WE

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:48.364
HAD SEVERAL- SUGGESTED LAYERS OF

02:56:48.431 --> 02:56:49.465
REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:56:49.532 --> 02:56:51.267
FROM. SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION

02:56:51.334 --> 02:56:54.303
UPDATES TO MORE- FORMAL ANNUAL

02:56:54.370 --> 02:56:57.306
REPORTS- AS WELL AS A MULTI YEAR

02:56:57.373 --> 02:56:59.408
REVIEWS. AND WOULD SUGGEST THAT-

02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:03.980
ANY. IT UPDATES ON IT SYSTEMS

02:57:04.046 --> 02:57:05.114
BEFORE THAT INTO THAT REPORTING

02:57:05.181 --> 02:57:09.452
. I'M NEXT- WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS

02:57:09.518 --> 02:57:11.420
FUTURE PROPOSALS FUTURITY

02:57:11.487 --> 02:57:13.856
PROPOSALS IN IN PUBLIC HEALTH SO

02:57:13.923 --> 02:57:16.892
WHEN THE DEPARTMENT- MAKES

02:57:16.959 --> 02:57:19.395
FUTURE PROPOSALS WE SUGGEST THE

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:21.130
LEGISLATURE ASK KEY QUESTIONS

02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:22.865
ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSED I. T.

02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:25.501
SYSTEMS FITS INTO THIS LARGER-

02:57:25.568 --> 02:57:28.671
IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ABOUT

02:57:28.738 --> 02:57:31.974
FUNDING- AS YOU WELL KNOW THE

02:57:32.041 --> 02:57:34.076
CDPH PROGRAMS AND I. T. SYSTEMS

02:57:34.143 --> 02:57:35.411
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN

02:57:35.478 --> 02:57:36.946
CHALLENGED BY THE CATEGORICAL

02:57:37.013 --> 02:57:38.714
NATURE OF PUBLIC HEALTH GRANT

02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:40.750
FUNDING. AND MOST I. T. SYSTEMS

02:57:40.816 --> 02:57:42.551
HAVE CONSEQUENTLY BEEN DEVELOPED

02:57:42.618 --> 02:57:45.321
SORT OF IN SILOS- LOOKING AHEAD

02:57:45.388 --> 02:57:47.056
EVEN WHEN GRANT FUNDING CAN ONLY

02:57:47.123 --> 02:57:48.791
BE USED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES

02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:50.192
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CDPH

02:57:50.259 --> 02:57:52.261
CAN'T CONSIDER THE PROJECT WITH

02:57:52.328 --> 02:57:54.296
IN THIS OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:57:54.363 --> 02:57:55.931
AND DEVELOP IT TO MAINTAIN

02:57:55.998 --> 02:57:58.267
CONSISTENCY SO FOR EXAMPLE MAKE

02:57:58.334 --> 02:58:00.669
SURE THAT DATA IS COLLECTED IN A

02:58:00.736 --> 02:58:02.371
WAY THAT CAN BE USED ACROSS

02:58:02.438 --> 02:58:04.206
SYSTEMS- AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

02:58:04.273 --> 02:58:05.841
ANY NEW SYSTEMS ARE

02:58:05.908 --> 02:58:08.310
INTEROPERABLE WITH OTHER- PUBLIC

02:58:08.377 --> 02:58:10.613
HEALTH SYSTEMS. SO WE SUGGEST

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:12.148
THAT THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE WILL

02:58:12.214 --> 02:58:13.816
WANT TO ASK ABOUT THESE TYPES OF

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:16.118
ISSUES EACH TIME A NEW PROPOSALS

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:19.455
PUT FORWARD. I'M A THIRD POINT-

02:58:19.522 --> 02:58:22.224
CONCERNS LOCAL INVOLVEMENT- THE

02:58:22.291 --> 02:58:24.660
B. C. P. NOTES THAT PLANNING AND

02:58:24.727 --> 02:58:26.362
DESIGN INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF

02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:28.097
HOW THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

02:58:28.164 --> 02:58:30.032
JURISDICTIONS WILL USE DATA AND

02:58:30.099 --> 02:58:32.802
I. T. SYSTEMS. AND IN ADDITION-

02:58:32.868 --> 02:58:35.104
MS MOORE NOTED THAT- THAT CITY

02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:37.006
PH WILL BE WORKING WITH LOCAL-

02:58:37.073 --> 02:58:38.307
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS IN THE

02:58:38.374 --> 02:58:40.242
PLANNING. PROCESS THIS IS

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:42.278
OBVIOUSLY VERY KEY AS THE STATE

02:58:42.344 --> 02:58:44.513
SYSTEMS DEPEND ON. THE LOCAL

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:47.683
SYSTEMS AND TE LOCAL INPUTS-

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:51.754
WORKING IN TANDEM- WHAT ONE

02:58:51.821 --> 02:58:52.788
THING THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

02:58:52.855 --> 02:58:54.590
TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER CDPH

02:58:54.657 --> 02:58:56.459
SHOULD REQUIRE THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:58:56.525 --> 02:58:58.694
JURISDICTIONS TO INCLUDE. SORT

02:58:58.761 --> 02:59:01.397
OF AN IT COMPONENT IN THE PLANS

02:59:01.464 --> 02:59:03.599
THAT SO THE LOCL PUBLIC CULTURE

02:59:03.666 --> 02:59:07.169
SECTIONS HAVE TO SUBMIT A PLAN-

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:08.704
AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING

02:59:08.771 --> 02:59:10.439
FUNDING AS PART OF THE FUTURE

02:59:10.506 --> 02:59:11.874
PUBLIC HEALTH THREE HUNDRED

02:59:11.941 --> 02:59:14.777
MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL- SO THE

02:59:14.844 --> 02:59:16.879
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER-

02:59:16.946 --> 02:59:20.116
REQUIRING CDPH TO. REQUIRE THAT

02:59:20.182 --> 02:59:22.618
THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH

02:59:22.685 --> 02:59:24.954
DEPARTMENTS- MAYBE ADDRESS THE

02:59:25.020 --> 02:59:27.490
STATUS OR WEAKNESSES OF THEIR

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:29.758
OWN A. T. SYSTEMS AND HOW THOSE

02:59:29.825 --> 02:59:33.529
MIGHT BE ADDRESSED- AND THEN.

02:59:33.596 --> 02:59:34.864
FINALLY ON THESE HIGHER LEVEL

02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:37.466
COMMENTS WE ADDRESS RECOMMENDED-

02:59:37.533 --> 02:59:38.968
WITH THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:41.971
PROPOSAL THAT THAT PROPOSAL B.

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:44.073
CODIFIED INTO STATUTE VIA

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.075
TRAILER BILL AND WE RECOMMEND

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:47.843
THAT THIS PROPOSAL BE INCLUDED

02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:49.145
WITH THAT. CURRENTLY

02:59:49.211 --> 02:59:50.913
EVERYTHING'S IN PROVISIONAL

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:54.283
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- SO A FEW A

02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:55.718
FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL

02:59:55.784 --> 02:59:57.620
ITSELF WHICH REALLY STARTS THE

02:59:57.686 --> 02:59:59.288
PROCESS OF MODERNIZING THE

02:59:59.355 --> 03:00:00.156
STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH

03:00:00.222 --> 03:00:00.990
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

03:00:01.056 --> 03:00:05.194
INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M FIRST OUR

03:00:05.261 --> 03:00:07.229
FIRST COMIC CONCERNS PLANNING SO

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:09.298
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

03:00:09.365 --> 03:00:12.835
AUGMENT- IT'S ONE TIME RESOURCES

03:00:12.902 --> 03:00:14.470
ONCE. ENTERPRISE PLANNING AND

03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:17.106
STRATEGY DOCUMENTS ARE SUBMITTED

03:00:17.173 --> 03:00:19.308
TO AND APPROVED BY CAL HHS AND

03:00:19.375 --> 03:00:21.477
THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY-

03:00:21.544 --> 03:00:23.445
THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

03:00:23.512 --> 03:00:25.915
WHETHER THE PROPOSED- A BUDGET

03:00:25.981 --> 03:00:27.483
BILL LANGUAGE MIGHT BE AMENDED

03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:29.051
SO THAT THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE

03:00:29.118 --> 03:00:30.519
PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE AS

03:00:30.586 --> 03:00:33.556
WELL- A REVIEW OF THESE

03:00:33.622 --> 03:00:34.790
DOCUMENTS WILL BE CRITICAL FOR

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:35.991
THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:37.826
HOW THE FREE MARKET VISION IN

03:00:37.893 --> 03:00:39.562
THE PROPOSAL. WILL ACTUALLY BE

03:00:39.628 --> 03:00:41.730
IMPLEMENTED. AND PART OF THAT

03:00:41.797 --> 03:00:43.532
REVIEW SHOULD FOCUS ON WHICH I.

03:00:43.599 --> 03:00:46.268
T. PROJECTS AND EFFORTS ARE MOST

03:00:46.335 --> 03:00:47.570
CRITICAL TO MODERNIZING THE

03:00:47.636 --> 03:00:48.771
STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH IT

03:00:48.837 --> 03:00:51.106
INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE

03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:52.975
SOME OF THE STATE'S- PUBLIC

03:00:53.042 --> 03:00:54.543
HEALTH IT SYSTEMS LIKE THE VITAL

03:00:54.610 --> 03:00:57.746
RECORD SYSTEMS- MUST REMAIN

03:00:57.813 --> 03:00:59.315
FUNCTIONAL. EVEN WHILE THEY'RE

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:01.784
BEING MODERNIZED- OTHER SYSTEMS

03:01:01.850 --> 03:01:03.385
HAVE A NUMBER OF INTERFACES WITH

03:01:03.452 --> 03:01:06.288
EXTERNAL ENTITIES AND INTERNAL

03:01:06.355 --> 03:01:08.157
SMALLER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONES

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:09.725
AT THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTION

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:12.027
LEVEL OR- WITH OTHER HEALTH

03:01:12.094 --> 03:01:16.098
SYSTEM. CARE SYSTEMS- AND THESE

03:01:16.165 --> 03:01:18.267
THAT NEED YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

03:01:18.334 --> 03:01:19.835
HAVE TO MAINTAIN INTER

03:01:19.902 --> 03:01:22.238
OPERABILITY- THE ENTERPRISE

03:01:22.304 --> 03:01:23.739
PLANNING AND STRATEGY DOCUMENT

03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:25.241
SHOULD PROVIDE NOT ONLY THE

03:01:25.307 --> 03:01:26.775
LEVEL OF EFFORT REQUIRED TO

03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:29.144
COMPLETE- THE IT PROJECTS BUT

03:01:29.211 --> 03:01:30.813
ALSO CLEARLY IDENTIFY WHICH

03:01:30.879 --> 03:01:32.381
EFFORTS AND PROJECTS ARE MOST

03:01:32.448 --> 03:01:35.050
CRITICAL. AND FOR WHICH ANY

03:01:35.117 --> 03:01:37.953
POTENTIAL RISKS NEED TO BE

03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:39.922
MITIGATED. I'M OUR SECOND N. AND

03:01:39.989 --> 03:01:41.991
LAST COMMENT IS THAT- THE

03:01:42.057 --> 03:01:43.959
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PROPOSES

03:01:44.026 --> 03:01:45.327
IN THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:47.963
LANGUAGE TO CONSIDER. A VERIFIED

03:01:48.030 --> 03:01:50.132
IT SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD

03:01:50.199 --> 03:01:52.468
COMPLETION OF PLANNING IN THE

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:54.703
PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE COULD

03:01:54.770 --> 03:01:56.538
ASK HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:01:56.605 --> 03:01:57.573
FINANCE WILL MEASURE THIS

03:01:57.640 --> 03:01:59.608
PROGRESS- AND WHETHER MORE

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:01.577
OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF PROGRESS

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:02.878
SUCH AS THE COMPLETION OF

03:02:02.945 --> 03:02:04.913
CERTAIN DOCUMENTS. MEETING

03:02:04.980 --> 03:02:07.316
CERTAIN MILESTONES- SHOULD BE

03:02:07.383 --> 03:02:10.386
INCLUDED- AND THIS OBVIOUSLY

03:02:10.452 --> 03:02:11.887
COULD INVOLVE NOTIFICATION OF

03:02:11.954 --> 03:02:14.189
THE LEGISLATURE- WE JUST CLOSE

03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.524
BY NOTING THAT THE FREE MARKET

GOALS AND VISION OF THIS

03:02:16.659 --> 03:02:18.594
PROPOSAL HAVE MERIT. BUT THE

03:02:18.661 --> 03:02:19.695
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO

03:02:19.762 --> 03:02:21.196
PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATE

03:02:21.263 --> 03:02:22.765

WHEEL HOUSE AND IT'S REALLY MORE

03:27:15.389 --> 03:27:17.958
OF A LEAD PERSON I HAVE BEEN

03:27:18.025 --> 03:27:19.560

YOU KNOW OTHER STATE THAT. BOB

03:27:33.808 --> 03:27:37.278
HANDLED THE COVERT SITUATION SO

03:27:37.344 --> 03:27:39.814
MUCH DIFFERENTLY THAN CALIFORNIA

03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:44.185
HOUSE AND SOMEHOW WE'RE STILL.

03:27:44.251 --> 03:27:45.419
YOU KNOW OVER TWO YEARS LATER IN

03:27:45.486 --> 03:27:48.756
THE- LOCKDOWN SITUATION- OR

03:27:48.823 --> 03:27:50.324
RATHER MORE LIKE A STATE OF

03:27:50.391 --> 03:27:52.960
EMERGENCY PER THE GOVERNOR AND

03:27:53.027 --> 03:27:55.229
YOU LEGISLATORS DON'T SEEM TO

BE- DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT

03:27:58.766 --> 03:28:00.301

03:28:00.367 --> 03:28:04.638
DOCUMENTS THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S

03:28:04.705 --> 03:28:08.342
ALL THIS THE MONEY BEING SPENT.

03:28:08.409 --> 03:28:11.345

MAJORITY OF STATES HAVE HANDLED

03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:14.982
MUCH DIFFERENTLY WITH FAR BETTER

03:28:15.049 --> 03:28:19.353
OUTCOMES. THAT IS LIKE A COLD

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:21.689

FREIGHT TRAIN OF- MANDATE AND-

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:30.064
THE STRONG ARMING OF PEOPLE JUST

03:28:30.130 --> 03:28:32.166
CONTINUES TO STAMPEDE AHEAD AT

03:28:32.233 --> 03:28:36.470
THE- SO- I DON'T REALLY HAVE

LIKE ANY- I MEAN I COULD GO ON

03:28:40.975 --> 03:28:43.143
FOR HOURS RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S A

03:28:43.210 --> 03:28:45.512
REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING

03:28:45.579 --> 03:28:47.414
THEY DON'T WANT THESE COVERT

03:28:47.481 --> 03:28:50.484
RELATED MANDATES AND BILLS TO

03:28:50.551 --> 03:28:53.153
PASS AND SO IT'S REALLY ALARMING

03:28:53.220 --> 03:28:56.857
FOR ME TO SEE IN THE DOCUMENT

03:28:56.924 --> 03:28:58.225

03:29:27.021 --> 03:29:29.523
JUST AS KIND OF A OF THE FIGHT

03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:32.459
TO THAT IT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU

03:29:32.526 --> 03:29:35.262

FEW MOMENTS TO SPEAK WITH

ACTUALLY FEEL- RELEVANCE TO ME

03:29:52.379 --> 03:29:56.383
IN SOME WAY BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS

03:29:56.450 --> 03:30:00.020
- THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS IS

03:30:00.087 --> 03:30:01.422

03:30:01.488 --> 03:30:04.291

THEY DON'T WANT THESE VACCINES

03:30:16.136 --> 03:30:17.404
