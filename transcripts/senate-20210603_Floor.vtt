WHERE THEY ARE. AND WE HAVE A

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:57.288

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:05.496
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:06.598

SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.570
THAT IS DOING THAT WORK BECAUSE

TRANSITION. FOR THOSE OIL

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.384
WORKERS. BECAUSE THAT WORK

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.286
HAPPENS TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:29.554
NEAR WHERE THE OIL EXTRACTION

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.155

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:05.717
WORKERS WILL NOT BE FIRED

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:06.918

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:14.926
PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

AND FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:28.206
ISSUE I'M- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

00:33:28.272 --> 00:33:30.608
THE WORK FORCE IMPACTED HERE I

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.176
JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WHAT

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:34.746
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- WE'RE NOT

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:38.649

EMPLOYEES OF AN OWNER OPERATOR.

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.387
SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:45.223
ABOUT- THE CONTRACTORS OR

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:46.791
SUBCONTRACTORS I JUST WANNA BE

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.693
CLEAR BECAUSE THE BILL ALREADY

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.863
EXPLICITLY EXAMS ALL EMPLOYEES

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.698
OF ALL THE OWNER OPERATORS.

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:56.067
IT'S REALLY WHEN THEY CONTRACT

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:58.970
OUT- WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE

00:33:59.036 --> 00:33:59.470
GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:03.374
PREVAILING WAGE. I THINK WE-

00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:04.308

YOUR ATTENTION TO- PAGE SIX.

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:13.251
IT'S VERY CLEAR THIRTY ONE

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.819
EIGHTY FOUR I THINK I PAID SIX

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.154
SECTION IS NOT APPLIED AT A

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.422
CHLOE'S OF AN OWNER OPERATOR

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:19.257
THE WEATHER PRODUCTION FACILITY

00:34:19.323 --> 00:34:20.958
OR PREVENT THE OWNER OPERATOR

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.326
FROM USING ITS OWN EMPLOYEES TO

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.361
PERFORM ANY OF THE WORK THAT

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:25.129
HASN'T BEEN ASSIGNED. TO

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:29.100

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.369
CONTRACTOR PRESENT AND WORKING-

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:34.238

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:41.646
I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:42.914
ACHIEVE THE MECHANICS YOU'RE

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.016
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.317

WAGE IN ANYWAY HERE- SO. YOU

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.324
KNOW. IF THE IF THE IF WE'RE

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:55.760
SAYING WE WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.862
TO SAY. KEEP THAT JOB THEY HAVE

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.130

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.169
IMAGE TO ME THAT UNDERCUTS THE

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.671
PREMISE OF THE BILL. I THINK.

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.506
VIEW THE WAY IN PRACTICE THIS

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:09.707
LEGISLATION THIS TYPE OF

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.909
LEGISLATION IS WORK WE PASSED A

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.010
SIMILAR MEASURE IN THE REFINERY

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:15.346
SECTOR- SP FIFTY FOUR I THINK

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.048
IT WAS. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:19.383
BEEN HERE MAYBE SIX SIX SEVEN

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.986
YEARS AGO. THERE'S AN EXPEDITED

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:26.224
TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT- THAT

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.627
WAS USED FOR ACCOUNTING BOTH

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:32.163
PASTELS I WORKED IN THE FIELD

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.599
AS WELL AS- SORT OF PERCENTAGE

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:37.602
BASIS SO IN PRACTICE IN OTHER

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:39.270
WORDS THE WAY THE INDUSTRY WE

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.638
BELIEVE WOULD MANAGE THE

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.340
IMPLEMENTATION IS LEGISLATION

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:45.343
WOULD BE THAT ON A CRAFT BASIS

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:47.111
NOT A 100% WOULD HAVE TO

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:48.813
NECESSARILY COMPLETE ALL THE

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.714
STANDARD APPRENTICESHIP

THAT TERM IS DOESN'T COMPORT

00:35:57.255 --> 00:35:58.723
WITH HOW INDUSTRY PRACTICES IT

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.092
HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED- SO I

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:04.862
WOULD. JUST SAY. LOOK AT THE

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.531
INTENT OF THIS BILL IS ENACTED

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:09.133
AWAY ANYONE'S JOB. BUT IT IS TO

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.135
PUSH THE EMPLOYER'S SPECIALLY

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.271
THE CONTRACTORS AND

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:15.106
SUBCONTRACTORS TO STEP UP.

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:17.375
INSERTING PREVAILING WAGE SO I

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:20.278
WANT TO JUST CLEAR I MEAN ASK A

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:20.878
QUESTION BACK TO THE QUESTION

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:23.114
BUT I DON'T WANT. THE KIND OF

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.649
AMENDMENT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:27.151
IF YOU WOULD ALLOW. THEN THIS

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:28.486
SORT OF CURRENT PRACTICES TO

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:30.488
CONTINUE I WOULDN'T BE

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.423
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT- BUT IF

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.392

HAPPENS TO WORK FOR A

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:45.870
CONTRACTOR INSTEAD OF THE OIL

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.271
PRODUCER THAT THEY DON'T GET

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:50.274

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.243
HARMS AS A RESULT. AND I HAVE

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.378
NO PROBLEM WITH THOSE WORKERS

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:57.481
ALSO BEING TRANSITIONS TO

PREVAILING WAGE PROTECTIONS

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:02.720
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.422
WORKING FOR A CONTRACT. BUT THE

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.624
QUESTIONS FOR THOSE NUMEROUS

CONTRACTORS WHAT IS THE PATH

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:12.830
GOING TO BE FOR THEM RIGHT I

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:13.531

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:16.867
HAVE TO WE'VE HEARD THE

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:18.069
CONCERNS ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.537
GO TO THE BACK OF THE LINE FOR.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.906
APPRENTICESHIPS AND I ANSWER

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:24.141
THE QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS YOU

THEM SO THEY'RENOT GETTING

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:30.281
PREVAILING WAGE- THE QUESTION

00:37:30.348 --> 00:37:33.050
IS WHAT IS. THIS I WOULD WANT

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:34.352
THE BILL TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:36.954
THE PATHWAY IS. FOR THEM AS

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:39.256
WELL THAT THAT'S MY THAT'S THE

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:42.760

AND TRAINED PROCESS MY

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.213
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT ONLY

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.881
REQUIRES A PRINTER SHOULD

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.616

OTHER. TEN FORTY REMAINING

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:17.128
4270% CAN BE- ANYWAY- IT

IF THERE WERE SOME OF THESE

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:28.673
FOLKS WHO WERE IN- EXISTING.

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.307
BANK WITH EXISTING CONTRACTORS

ACTUALLY DON'T WORK FOR

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:39.250
ANYBODY- AND SORT OF HAVE TO GO

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.518

OPERATOR OXEN THIS BILL DOES

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:06.010
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:08.112
APPRENTICESHIP PROCESS. BUT IT

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:13.484
DOESN'T. REQUIRE EVERYONE TO GO

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.151
THROUGH IT SO. IF THAT NEEDSBE.

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.352
CLARIFIED MORE HELP INDUSTRY

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:19.190
PRACTICE WORKS- I'M I'M HAPPY

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:19.924
TO DO THAT IN SOME KIND OF

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.893
FINDING OR- OR AN EXPLANATION

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.329
BUT I. I'M JUST I'M I'M- I'M A

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:29.366
LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT- ADAPTING

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:31.702
ITS WHOLESALE AN AMENDMENT THAT.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.371
COULD HAVE- COULD HAVE

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.307
IMPLICATIONS FOR SORT OF

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.708
ALLOWING THAT THAT KIND OF

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.376
CONTRACTING TO KEEP GOING ON I

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:40.511
THINK THAT THAT DENIGRATES THE

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:42.012
QUALITY OF THE WORK I THINK

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.448
IT'S A PROBLEM SO- I CONCERNED

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.217
THAT'S AN UNSATISFYING ANSWER

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:48.385
BUT- I THINK THAT IF WE CAN

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:49.820
ARTICULATE MORE THE INDUSTRY

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:51.222

ABILITIES TO DO THIS WORK MAYBE

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:57.962

ACROSS THE STATE SO I AM ONLY

SPEAKING ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IN

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:40.998
CONCERN I HAVE THE OIL FIELD IN

FEROCIOUSLY TRYING TO CLOSE IT

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:45.636
THE REALITY IS MOST OF THE

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.704
FOLKS THAT WORK AT THAT SITE

00:46:47.771 --> 00:46:49.740
OUR BLACK AND BROWN. BEEN ABLE

COLLEGE AND THEIR GRANDKIDS

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:54.611

INDUSTRY AND ABOUT THAT

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:01.385
PARTICULAR SITE. I WOULD HATE

AROUND JUST TRANSITION BUT B. I

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:09.693
WOULD HATE TO WAKE UP AND SEE

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.627
THAT ALL OF THOSE FOLKS THAT

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.095
WORK THERE. HAVE NOW BEEN

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.997
REPLACED BY OTHER FOLKS THAT

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.032
DON'T LOOK LIKE THE COMMUNITY

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.000
IN WHICH THEY WORK SO MAYBE

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.168
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.204
ADDRESSED BECAUSE IT IS REALLY

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.706
LEGITIMATE. YOU KNOW THE SUBS.

WHO THE PERSON IS. DIVERSITY BE

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.920

WORKERS ARE GOING TO GET FIRED.

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.834
IT'S A REALLY SMART WAY OF

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:39.870
DISTRACTING FROM THE CORE ISSUE

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:42.739

CALLING I APPRECIATE THE

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.266
CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENING

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.201
AND I THINK YOU KNOW MY

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:45.168
COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:46.703
TALKED A LOT ABOUT A HIGH

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:47.938
QUALITY STANDARD AND HOW

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:50.106
IMPORTANT THAT IS- IN IN I

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:51.041
THINK OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:52.943
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TWO

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:54.878
DAYS. THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.446
VEHICLE THAT'S ALLOWED FOR

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.747
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.082
LEGISLATIVE INPUT AND

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:00.851
LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. AND I ALSO

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.919
THINK OF THE FACT THAT THOSE

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:05.155
WHO ARE SUPPORTING- THIS

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.457
PROCESS- HAVE YOU NOR

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.259
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THIS BILL

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.327
BUT HAVE NOT ALLOWED THAT

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:12.028
CONVERSATION FOR OTHER BILLS.

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.964
AND I WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT IT

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.565
WOULD BE LIKE IF WE WERE ABLE

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.334
TO HAVE A TRUE CONVERSATION

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.170
ABOUT WHAT ALL OF THIS NEEDS.

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:22.906
TO BE ALL ENERGY JOBS NOT JUST

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.141
TO THE OIL INDUSTRY WE HAVE A

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.310
LIMITED OURSELVES NOT JUST IN

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:28.078
THIS HOUSE BUT IN THIS

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:30.313
LEGISLATURE TO ALLOWING THOSE

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.548
KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS TO

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.817
HAPPEN. I HAVE HEARD COLLEAGUES

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:36.253
TODAY SAY I AM HAPPY THAT THIS

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.988
ROBUST CONVERSATION IS

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:41.024
HAPPENING WHAT ABOUT FOR OTHER

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:43.827
SECTORS. THESE ARE ALL VALID

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:49.900
POINTS. WAGES. SAFETY STANDARD.

00:52:49.966 --> 00:52:52.836
IMPORTERS LOCAL HIRE WHERE ARE

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:55.038
THOSE OTHER CONVERSATIONS AND I

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:57.173
HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.109
POTENTIALLY MOVES FORWARD IT

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:02.546
HIGHLIGHTS HOW MUCH THESE

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:05.415
CONVERSATIONS CAN FEED INTO AN

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.051
OUTCOME THAT HELPS EVERYONE AND

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:08.818
I THINK THAT AS I'VE HEARD

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.453
COLLEAGUES AND YOU KNOW MY

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.155
COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD-

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.123
WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ON THE SAME

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.591
SIDE OF ENERGY BUT THERE HAVE

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:15.692
BEEN SOME VERY ROBUST

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:18.094
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.863
MEANS TO THE EVERYDAY

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.797
CALIFORNIAN AND HOW WE

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.966
TRANSITION THOSE THAT ARE

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.302
ALREADY WORKING IN THIS SPACE

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.137
TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:29.406
A UNION. THAT'S A GOOD THING

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.440
FOR THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.609
THAT AND SO I THINK THAT THIS

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:33.944
ISN'T YOU KNOW IMPORTANT TO

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.679
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL HAS

00:53:35.745 --> 00:53:37.280
GENERATED A NEEDED CONVERSATION

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:38.348
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.683
RECOGNIZE THAT THE COMMENTS

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:41.351
THAT ARE BEING MADE ARE NOT

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:44.054
SIMPLY LIMITED TO IT SHOULD NOT

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.122
IN MY OPINION BE SIMPLY LIMITED

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:48.391
TO THIS SOURCE OF ENERGY THERE

00:53:48.458 --> 00:53:51.194
ARE MANY ENERGY JOBS OUT THERE

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.863
THAT NEED THIS CONVERSATION-

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.932
AND SO I HOPE THAT IF THIS BILL

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.934
MOVES FORWARD TODAY- WE DON'T

THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT AREAS

AND IN A SPECIALLY IN THE

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:41.378
VALLEY AND IN THE CENTER FROM

BAKERSFIELD HER HER CAN HURT

THE- ECONOMY IS MOSTLY AG AND

AN OIL MADE UP THAT IS. THAT IS

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.120
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.988
ECONOMY AND LET'S NOT BE LET'S

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:54.224
NOT KID OURSELVES BOTH OF THOSE

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.226
INDUSTRIES ARE OFTEN UNDER

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:57.527
ATTACK IN THIS HOUSE SUCH I

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:58.662
MEAN IT'S JUST THE NATURE I

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:01.665
THINK OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:03.600
OPERATE. AND I'M AND WE ALL

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:06.036
BELIEVE IN A IN A AT PEOPLE

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.637
BEING PAID A DECENT WAGE WE ALL

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.673
BELIEVE THOSE THINGS BUT AT THE

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:12.075
SAME TIME THAT DRESS THAT JUST

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:15.578
TRANSITION FOR ALL WORKERS- I

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.646
HAVE ALSO TALKED TO THOSE

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.481
WORKERS AND THEY ARE MAJORITY

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.883
BLACK AND BROWN WHO LIVE IN

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.718
THAT AREA. OF FOLKS IN AREAS

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:22.886
LIKE WE REPRESENT THAT

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:23.687
OFTENTIMES THEY GO IN THE

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:24.821
MILITARY OR THE PRISON

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.656
SOMETIMES BOTH AND WHEN THEY

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:27.891
COME BACK TO FAMILIES ARE THERE

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.059
AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.727
MAKE A LIVING SO I WOULD

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.362
CERTAINLY ASK THAT THIS BILL

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.164
DOES NOTHING TO DISPLACE THOSE

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.132
WORKERS BUT HELP PEOPLE COME

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:38.802
ALONG AND NOT TO ME WE CAN TALK

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.336
ABOUT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:42.505
ACHIEVE A STANDARD. BUT WE ALSO

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:43.873
HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS IN

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.308
THIS BUILDING ABOUT EQUITY AND

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.609
EQUALITY AND SOMETIMES THAT

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:47.877
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.246
SOMETIMES THERE IS A LOT BIGGER

00:55:50.313 --> 00:55:53.083
BRIDGE- THAT FOLKS NEED TO BE

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:54.784
ABLE TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE-

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.519
AND RUSHING TO DO THAT I THINK

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.321
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO.

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:00.457
IS UPSET AND ECONOMY AND THAT

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:03.460
HAS CREATED A MIDDLE CLASS LIFE

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:04.094
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.395
TO OWN THEIR HOME SEND THEIR

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.963
KIDS TO COLLEGE THOSE ARE THE

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.465
EXACT KIND OF THINGS WE WANT

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.833
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES

00:56:09.899 --> 00:56:11.501
OF GENERATIONAL WEALTH IN THIS

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:13.069
HOUSE RIGHT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:14.170
ABILITY TO OWN A HOME IN THE

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:17.707
PAST. THAT ON YOUR KID THAT'S

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:18.341
WHAT A LOT OF THESE WERE OCCURS

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:18.975
IN THE BIGGEST CURRENT- WE HAVE

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.110
BEEN ABLE TO. AND SO AS WE

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.711
RUSSIAN AND LET'S NOT PRETEND

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:22.445
THE BUILDING TRADES DON'T HAVE

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.647
A LOT OF. POWER IN THIS ROOM IN

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.716
THIS BUILDING OKAY. AND LET'S

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.884
NOT PRETEND LIKE THIS THIS BILL

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.786
IS NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM ALL

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.687
RIGHT THAT'S THAT THAT IS JUST

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.655
WHAT IT IS. SO THE SAME TIME WE

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.590
WANT TO HELP THEM WE WANT

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:34.924
EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.426
PROTECTED. IF THEY CHOOSE TO BE

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.360
AND YOU NEED TO BE IN THE

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.596
UNION. BUT LET'S NOT PRETEND

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:40.897
AND LET HIS BLOOD IS TO BE VERY

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.532
HONEST ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION.

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:43.833
THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE TO

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.434
GO BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE AND

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.902
THEN COME BACK OVER HERE. THAT

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:48.204
I THINK WE ARE VERY SERIOUS AND

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.739
MY- CALLING FROM SANTA BARBARA

00:56:49.806 --> 00:56:51.808
MAKES THIS POINT TOO. ABOUT HOW

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.543
DO WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:54.878
ABOUT NOT LEAVING EVERYDAY

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.713
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORKING IN

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.047
AN INDUSTRY THAT IS IN THEIR

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.216
AREA THERE ARE LOCAL. AND THEN

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:01.451
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DISPLACE

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:04.220
THEM. BY SOME OF OUR LARGER.

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.955

WHO WANT TO DO BUT LET'S NOT

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.358
LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND I THINK

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:08.925
THAT HOPEFULLY IS WHAT

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.260
CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT. THAT'S

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:12.028
WHAT WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.329
IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN OTHER

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:15.098
SECTORS AND IN OTHER AREAS THAT

PREMISE HERE ABOUT HOW THE BILL

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.956

PERCENT. AND TWENTY FOURTH

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:24.740

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.612

ABOUT HOW THIS BILL FUNCTIONS-

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.984
IT DOESN'T FORCE UNIONIZATION.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.819

I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.183
FIFTEEN YEARS ON. SAFETY ISSUES

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.518
RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.954
PROJECTS DATING BACK TO- MY

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.689
YEARS IN THE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:27.990
WE HAD AN INCIDENT THAT CALLED

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:30.559
IT BECAUSE IN ELECTRIC. FUSION

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:34.063
AND DEATH. OF A OF A PERSON

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.665
USING SENDING US TRANSIT SYSTEM

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:38.567
BECAUSE- A BUS STOP WAS BUILT

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.703
WITH A DEFECT THAT CREATED. A

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.272
HAZARD THAT KILLED SOMEBODY AND

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.875
WE RESPONDED BY THAT. SO I WANT

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:47.476
TO DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO THE

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.278
MEMBERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.646
THE FENCE ON THIS AND I HAVE

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.381
SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE I.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.350
INITIALLY STARTED TODAY SHARING

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.752
THOSE CONCERNS AND I THOUGHT-

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.154
MAYBE THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.790
WORKED ON BUT I WAS REMINDED OF

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.758
ALL THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:03.292
THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.761
SPECIFICALLY. MEMBERS WE'VE

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:08.230
DONE THIS ALREADY. AND WE HAVE

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.866
ALREADY VOTED ON BILLS. THAT

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.002
SHARE THIS EXACT SAME LANGUAGE

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:14.970
ONE WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SP

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.673
FIFTY FOUR. THAT WAS A SAFETY

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.943
RELATED ISSUE. IT DIDN'T APPLY

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.045
TO THESE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:23.846
SO THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.649
FOLD- THOSE WORKERS INTO THE

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.918
SAME PROGRAM UNDER THE EXACT

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:31.354
SAME PROCESS. THE WAY THAT BILL

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.924
WAS- SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR PUT

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:38.861
INTO OPERATION. MEMBERS NOT ONE

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:41.931
WORKER WAS DISPLACED. NOT ONE

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.566
WORKER WAS DISPLACED UNDER THAT

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:48.204
BILL. AND IF THINGS ARE DONE.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:48.938
IDENTICAL TO THAT BILL WHICH I

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.940
BELIEVE THEY WILL. NOT ONE

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.308
WORKER WILL BE DISPLACED UNDER

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.111
THE UNDER THIS BILL. SO I JUST

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:55.911
WANT TO RESPOND TO THE

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:58.381
COMMENTS. WHEN WE SAY LET'S NOT

01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.648
PRETEND THE BUILDING TRADES ARE

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:00.850

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.257
HASN'T BENEFITED. FROM BETTER

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.558
TRAINED WORKERS FROM BETTER

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.794
PAID WORKERS FROM HAVING PEOPLE

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.596
ON THE JOB THAT YOU KNOW

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:15.731
PRECISELY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.800
IN THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.902

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:25.141
INCIDENCE. OF- OF ACCIDENTS

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.379
OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE BEING

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:34.717
TOUTED AS- THE- THE RESULT OF

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:37.086

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.568
RIGHT THING TO DO MEMBERS TODAY

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:54.737

TRAINED WORKFORCE. AND THEY'LL

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.813
BE A BETTER PROCESS AND IT

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.382
DOESN'T. PREVENT WORKERS THAT

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:11.487

BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:04.667

HERE THAT IS A SOLUTION LOOKING

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.490
FOR A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD NOT

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.926
BE THE JOB OF THE SENATE TO

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.461
