02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:26.991
PART AND JUSTICE MR BENNETT WAS

02:29:27.058 --> 02:29:29.560
SAYING- THAT PART HAS TO BE

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:31.395
ADDRESSED IN OUR EFFORTS TO

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:34.498
REFORM THE ELECTION PROCESS-

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.233
THE BALLOT IN. THE MAIL IN

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.369
BALLOT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:41.038
THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN TWO

02:29:41.105 --> 02:29:42.340
THOUSAND THREE I BELIEVE IT WAS

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:46.243
THERE IS A PANEL ON- D.

02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:49.213
ELECTION AL REFORM. AND THE ONE

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.448
THING THAT THEY SAID WE SHOULD

02:29:50.514 --> 02:29:52.183
THEY SHOULD WOULD BE MOST COST

02:29:52.249 --> 02:29:54.452
IS ABOUT IS AN ALL MAIL BALLOT

02:29:54.518 --> 02:29:56.554
AND THAT'S WHY. N. A. N. A. N.

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:57.888
A. PAINS ME WHEN PEOPLE JUST

02:29:57.955 --> 02:30:00.024
DISMISS THE CONCERNS OF MANY

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:03.961
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE SHOULD BE

02:30:04.028 --> 02:30:06.297
SURE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE

02:30:06.364 --> 02:30:07.064
POLLS THEIR VOTE ATUALLY DOES

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:09.633
COUNT. AND IT BECAUSE IF THEY

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:11.001
LOSE THAT CONFIDENCE IN THE

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:13.170
VOTING SYSTEM THAT'S ALSO VOTER

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:14.605
SUPPRESSION BECAUSE IF THEY

02:30:14.672 --> 02:30:16.674
LOSE IT AND JUST STOPPED GOING-

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:18.175
THEN WE'RE LOSING THE VOICE OF

02:30:18.242 --> 02:30:21.479
THAT PERSON. SO YOU KNOW I CAN

02:30:21.545 --> 02:30:22.713
TAKE I LOOK FORWARD TO

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:24.482
CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE ON HOW

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:27.651
WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE-

02:30:27.718 --> 02:30:28.419
CONFIDENCE IN THE VOTING

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:31.322
SYSTEM- BUYS MANY PEOPLE AS WE

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:34.158

02:30:34.225 --> 02:30:35.393
YOU CLOSE AND THEN WE'LL MOVE

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:36.293

02:30:46.003 --> 02:30:47.505
WHATEVER THE REASON AND I THINK

02:30:47.571 --> 02:30:48.606
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DIRECTLY

02:30:48.672 --> 02:30:49.940

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:50.808

ABOUT A REMARKABLY SAFE

OF L. L. C. A. N. THAT IS THAT-

02:43:53.390 --> 02:43:54.925
IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION IT
