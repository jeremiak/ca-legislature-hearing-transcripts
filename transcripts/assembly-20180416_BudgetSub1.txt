GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MEMBERS INTERMITTENTLY PRESENT AND SO IF WE CAN WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE. FULLER. HE'S VERY CLOSE. ALSO THE NORMAL. US A GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO JUST I WANTED TO QUICKLY THE AGENDA CERTAINLY DOES A NICE JOB. OF LAYING OUT THE. TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUBSTANCE YOU SERVICES THAT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM OFFERS TODAY BUT IN. HIGH TERMS OTHER TWO MODALITIES. SLASH DELIVERY SYSTEM SO WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL TWO STATE PLAN COUNTIES AND THEN WE HAVE ODS COUNTIES SO A FEW YEARS AGO. WE SOUGHT AND RECEIVED AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAID WAIVER TO CREATE AN ORGANIZED ON DELIVERY SYSTEM AS IT PERTAINS TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT SO IT'S THE FIRST IN THE NATION. ON IT WAS DONE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THAT COUNTIES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS CAN OPT INTO THIS WAIVER. THEY WILL BE YOU. ALLOWED TO PROVIDE A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE RANGING FROM INPATIENT RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SERVICES FOR I'M SUBSTANCE USE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT OUTPATIENT THERAPY. CASE MANAGEMENT. AND WAS REALLY KIND OF AN EXCITING. EXPANSION OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE OTHERWISE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PROVIDED IN THE STATE. THE OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT OPTED INTO THE WAIVER OR AIR THAT ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH THE WAIVER PROCESS. WE REFER TO AS OUR STATE PLAN SERVICES SO THERE'S FIVE MEAN. MODALITIES INPATIENT. INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT THERAPY OUTPATIENT DRUG FREE SERVICES. MEDICATION TREATMENT I E. UM METHADONE. BOB PARRY NAIL RESIDENTIAL AND I'M FORGETTING THE LAST ONE. BUT IT'S IT'S FAIRLY LIMITED AND IT HAS. IN LARGE PART. BEEN AND CHALLENGING I THINK FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT IS NOT. INCLUDE ANY KIND OF RESIDENTIAL OR. INPATIENT DETOX TREATMENT SO THAT HAS BEEN I THINK CHALLENGING DEPENDING ON THE ADDICTION. ISSUE THAT YOU ARE CONTENDING WITH. WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE WERE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT WE NEEDED TO ADOPT IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ORDER TO HAVE. A FULL A SET OF SERVICES THAT MET THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. STRUCTURE SO WE ADDED. THAT S. BIRD SO THIS. SCREENING BRIEF INTERVENTION. ASSIST SERVICE THAT IS. WRITTEN UP IN YOUR AGENDA AS AND BRIEF COUNSELING SESSION THAT INDIVIDUALS. CAN RECEIVE. WHEN A PROVIDER BELIEVES ARE THAT THEY INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROBLEM. IN LAST WEEK SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND WE WERE ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE AND CHAIR AND MEMBERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING AS IT PERTAINS TO THE. ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AND WHETHER WE THOUGHT THAT WAS AT RISK. AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IN WHAT I BROUGHT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS SUCH A GOOD QUESTION I'M TO SHARE WITH THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS REALLY MADE THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN. ODS WAIVER RELEVANT AND SO FOR THE COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE. IMPLEMENTED SINCE WE STARTED. LAST FEBRUARY. FOR EXAMPLE. COUNTY RIVERSIDE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT THE WAIVER. AND THEN JUST LOOKING AT THEIR EXPENDITURES IN TERMS OF THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNTS OF THIS IS THE MONEY THAT WE AS A STATE. REALIGNED TO THE COUNTIES THEY'VE USE NINE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THEIR BEHAVIORAL HOUSE OF ACCOUNT BUT THEY'VE DELIVERED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN SERVICES. TH TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION OF THAT IS FEDERAL FUNDS. IN THE REMAINING PORTION THE TWO MILLION IS ABOUT AS GENERAL FUNDS FROM FOR LOS ANGELES WHICH WAS. WENT LIVE LAST JULY. THEY HAVE SPENT SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT FUNDING SO THEIR OWN COUNTY FUNDING. BUT DRAWN DOWN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS AND SPENT FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL. SO I REALLY WANTED TO KIND OF. BOTH HIGHLIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE WEAVER HAS ALLOWED FOR THE COUNTIES TO DELIVER BUT ALSO THE. ENORMOUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR WHAT THAT DOES FOR IMPROVING AN INCREASING. SERVICES AND US IN THE STATE. I WILL PAPPY THE OFFICE OR INSERT QUESTIONS BUT I THINK IT ALSO. HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AROUND SUBSTANCE USE ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE NATION SAID BOTH RECEIVE. AND OBTAIN THI WAIVER. IT ALLOWED FOR US TO WAIVE. WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE I. M. D. RESTRICTIONS SO MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PREVENTED FROM. COVERING SERVICES IN INSTITUTES FOR MENTAL DISEASE WE RECEIVED A WAIVER OF THE I AM THE RESTRICTION SPECIFICALLY FOR SUBSTANCE TREATMENT FACILITY SO THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO DRAW DOWN. MONEY FOR THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE BENEFIT ALTOGETHER SO WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO. INTO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR CAN'T. NEXT WE HAVE TOM RAN FREELY FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON. MEMBERS. SO I AM TOM RENT FREE I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES FOR THEIR COUNTY HERE ON HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. I THINK BUT BETWEEN WHAT DIRECTOR CAN'T JUST GAVE US AN OVERVIEW AND THE EXCELLENT. ANALYSIS AND RIGHT UP IN IN THE AYE AGENDA. COVERED A LOT OF GROUND AYE I WOULD JUST SAY THE ONE ISSUE THAT THEY ASKED ARE COUNTIES TO RESPOND TO WOULD BE TO DESCRIBE THE WHAT WE. PERCEIVE AS THE OVERALL SENSE OF THE QUALITY AND THE ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OF ISSUES THAT WE WERE ASKED TO RESPOND TO IN TERMS OF STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. OVERALL I MEAN. THIS. THE EXPANSION OF DRUG MEDI CAL IS THE BIGGEST THING TO HIT OUR SYSTEM OF CARE AND IT IN THE EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FIELD I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS HUGE FOR COUNTIES I MEAN IT TOOK A SYSTEM. THAT WAS TRADITIONALLY VERY FEW BENEFITS BASICALLY METHADONE AND GROUP COUNSELING. VERY LOW RATES ARE YOU KNOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND IT REALLY EXPANDED INTO A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE SO NOW THAT. I COUNTIES THAT OF THAT OPT INTO THE. TO THE DELIVERY SYSTEM ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE ABLE TO OFFER FROM THE BEGINNING WITH SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION THROUGH DETOX ALL THE WAY THROUGH RESIDENTIAL HOW PATIENT INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT. RECOVERY SUPPORTS CASE MANAGEMENT THINGS THAT WE NEVER HAD THE ABILITY TO. TO BE ABLE TO RE UP BE REIMBURSED FOR UNLIKE A DIRECTOR CAN SET A GOT ACCESS TO A WHOLE. ROW RAY OF FEDERAL OF FEDERAL FUNDINGS WHICH HAS BEEN HELPFUL WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE TEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE THAT ARE NOW. FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM IS THAT. IT'S A IT'S A CHALLENGE ADMINISTRATIVELY I MEAN THERE'S A HUGE WORK LOAD A FOR THE COUNTIES BUT THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DELIVER SO MANY MORE SERVICES PROVIDES BEFORE. TAG BEING ABLE TO HELP SO MANY MORE PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY WERE FACING AN OPIOID CRISIS SINCE IT'S REALLY GREAT THAT WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE INTO SERVICES THAT'LL HELP THEM. IT YOU KNOW IMPROVE THEIR LIVES AND AND AND AND GET INTO RECOVERY FROM THEIR ADDICTION. ARE WE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR AND WE SUPPORT THE. THE STATE GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION THAT THE STATE HAS HAS PUT END OF FOR THE ODF SERVICES. AYE WE DID HAVE ONE. RECOMMENDATION THAT. PERHAPS LANGUAGE COULD BE ALLOWED FOR THE USE OF THIS STATE GENERAL FUNDING TO COVER. OTHER BENEFITS OTHER THAN RESIDENTIAL AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT RIGHT NOW COUNTIES. WITH THE STATE GENERAL FUND CAN ONLY CLAIM THAT FUNDING FOR A RESIDENTIAL INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. PERHAPS A MORE FLEXIBILITY WHERE OF COUNTIES WANTED TO THEY COULD UTILIZE THAT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED SUCH AS RECOVERY SUPPORTS AND CASE MANAGEMENT. THAT WAS INDICATED IN IN OUR LETTER. IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC UP BENEFITS THE SCREENING BRIEF INTERVENTION ARE REFERRAL TO TREATMENT SOMETIMES KNOWN AS S. BERT. IS ONLY REIMBURSABLE FOR ALCOHOL ARE WE DID HAVE A EIGHTY A RECOMMENDATION THAT. THE. FUNDING WOULD BE ABLE TO BE EXPANDED SO THAT THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE NEW FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO EXPAND THE BENEFIT TO INCLUDE A SCREENING AND COUNSELING. FOR THE MIS USE OF OPIOIDS ANOTHER ILLICIT DRUGS AS WELL IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR ALCOHOL WE THINK EXCRETE THIS KIND OF SCREENING COULD BE VALUABLE. FOR OTHER I'D ADD DRUGS AS WELL. IN REGARD TO. THERE'S ONE BENEFIT THAT'S NOT A DRUG MEDI CAL BENEFITS ACTUALLY IT WAS A NEW BENEFIT BUT IT WAS A ADDED UNDER MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE FOR VOLUNTARY INPATIENT DETOX. THIS CAN BE PROVIDED ONLY END UP ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS WE ARE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THIS IS A BENEFIT ON PAPER THAT IS NOT REALLY BEING. A VERY ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE A LOT OF HOT MOST HOSPITALS. DON'T OFFER DETOX SERVICES AND THE ONES THAT DO WORSE THERE ARE REPORTING THAT THEY'RE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BUILDING AND BEING. REIMBURSED OTHER SOME SORT A SNAG IN THE SYSTEM WHERE THEY'RE HAVING A REAL HARD TIME GETTING REIMBURSED. AND THAT'S KIND OF A DISINCENTIVE THEN FOR REFER THEM TO. OFFER THIS BENEFIT. DETOX IS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BENEFIT EXPANDED YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A PROPOSAL A LITTLE BIT LATER THAT. THAT WE SUPPORT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE A FOR THE EXPANSION OF THIS AND THEN FINALLY. A WE DO SUPPORT THE. WORKFORCE CAPACITY TRAINING THAT YOU'LL HEAR ALSO ABOUT FROM ONE OF OUR. PROVIDER AFFILIATES THE ONE AREA AND I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THIS. OUT. PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE. IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM THERE'S IS THIS TRANSITION THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY BETWEEN COUNTY OF SERVICE AND COUNT TO COUNTY OF RESPONSIBILITY. IT GETS KINDA COMPLICATED BUT UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT IN OUR FIELD A CLIENTS TEND TO MOVE THEY THEY. MIGHT SEEK SERVICES IN COUNTIES OTHER THAN THAT I COUNTY WHERE THEY ARE RESIDE OR WHERE THERE MEDI CAL WAS ESTABLISHED AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF MOVEMENT. OF CLIENTS TO GO TO OTHER COUNTIES UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM THE PROVIDER THAT WAS LOCATED IN IN ONE COUNTY EVEN IF THEY WERE SERVING. RESIDENTS FROM OTHER COUNTIES THAT THAT COUNTY RESPONSIBILITY WAS HAVE THE CONTRACT OF THE COUNTY OF SERVICE HAD THE CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDER SO THE PROVIDER WOULD BASICALLY. YOU KNOW SEND THE CLAIM TO THE COUNTING WHICH THEY WERE LOCATED THAT I UP COUNTY WOULD PAY THEM AND THEN WOULD WOULD SUBMIT THE CLAIMS TO THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE CLIENTS CAME FROM. UNDER THE TRANSITION TO COUNTY A RESPONSIBILITY NOW EACH COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE TO FOR THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT RESIDE IN THAT COUNTY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY GO FOR SERVICES SO THIS MEANS. THAT ONE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT HAVE ITS RESIDENTS GETTING SERVICES IN FIVE OR SIX OTHER COUNTIES. SO THEY HAVE TO NOW ESTABLISH CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS AND ALL THOSE OTHER COUNTIES. THE COUNTY CONTRACTING SYSTEM ISN'T YOU KNOW IS NOT SIMPLE THAT'S REQUIRES GOING TO THEIR BOARDS AND GETTING NEW CONTRACTS IT'S BEEN KIND OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE. BURDEN IN A SENSE TO GET ALL THESE NEW KIND AND IT AND IT TAKES TIME YOU KNOW TO GET THESE CONTRACTS STARTED IN THE MEANTIME THE PROVIDERS YOU KNOW THEY'RE HAVING TO SCRAMBLE TO SEE WHO THEY CAN YOU KNOW WHO THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET PAID. BY AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON A IS IS HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT TRANSITION THAT BECAME VERY COMPLICATED ONCE ONCE WE MADE THAT MOVE. ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT SO I THINK I'LL IN HERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER. BEFORE WE GO ON TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH FORM. ARAMBULA HERE. HARPER. MATHIS RUBIO HERE WOULD. THINK YOUR WE'LL HEAR FROM HELEN ASHAR. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HOLDING MEASURE HAVE WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAD. CAD VIEWS THE. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES. ALL OF OUR MEMBERS ARE STATE LICENSED AND CERTIFIED BY THE STATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE. STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS A REGARDING. A TREATMENT PROGRAM SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT WAS IT. UP THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK GOD AND THINK YOUR STAFF WHO DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF. OF REALLY IDENTIFYING THE ISSUES AND. REALLY CLARIFYING THEM CRYSTALLIZING THEM ON THE COMMITTEE AND SECONDLY I'D LIK TO TO ALSO. ACKNOWLEDGES. THAT DHEA S. DIRECTOR JENNIFER KENT'S DATA WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO HER ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND. OF WE HAVE FOUND HER TO BE OPEN AND. LOW OR. NO WILLING TO LISTEN TO US SO WHERE THEY'RE NOT WE AGREE ON THINGS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT I'M. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN VERY OPEN TO. TO MEETING WITH US AND TALKING TO US ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO HOPEFULLY WE KEEP THIS YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO RESOLVE SOME OF THEM. I'M. SO I'D LIKE TO START OUT WITH THAT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE IN THE HOME. IN THE ANALYSIS. AND ACTUALLY THE WORKFORCE CAPACITY BUILDING WE HAVE A WE SUPPORT THAT. UP WE HAVE NO NONE NO COMMENT ON THE SCREENING A BRIEF INTERVENTION PROPOSAL AS IT IS. THAT WOULD SUPPORTIVE. OF THE WORK FOR FORCED CAPACITY BUILDING ISSUE IS AN ISSUE THAT RECEIVE THAT IS PART OF. A THE AYE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DMC ó DS WAIVER. AYE ALONG WITH THE WAIVER CAME A VERY LONG LIST OF. TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND NEW ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE AS PROVIDERS. WHO PROVIDE THE SERVICES MUCH MUST MEET AND WE MUST DOCUMENT ALA THAT IN A WAY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE BOTH TO THE STATE AND TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF CMS IN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR? A THE FUNDING. OUR OUR STAFF HAVE. ASKED FOR AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT CHIU CRAFT OUT A TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT WOULD. TRAIN OUR STAFF IN COMPLIANCE EYES SO THAT WHEN. I THE TIME COMES FOR. OF COMPLIANCE REVIEWS. A THAT OUR DOCUMENTATION AND OUR. INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE TO STATE LAWS. I AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE WAIVER SO. UP WE ARE ASKING FOR. BUT IF IT IF WE BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN JANUARY ABOUT WORKING OUT A TRAINING PROGRAM. A SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE A REVIEW IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN. I IN MAKING SURE THAT. EVERYBODY IS. DOING. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO? I HAVE ACCEPTABLE REPORTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THIS. AND IT BECAME CLEAR TO US AS WE WERE OF MEETING WITH THE DEPARTMENT DAD ON THE TRAIN THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT SAID THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. A A ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE LEVEL OF. A EXPERTISE IT IS NEEDED. A TWO UP PROVIDE THE TRAINING SO WE HAVE ASKED OF FOR AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BE SPENT OVER. TWO YEARS. IN THE TWENTY COUNTIES THAT HAVE. IMPLEMENTED THE. UP ODS WAIVER. AYE TO MAKE SURE THAT. STAFF. IS. TRAINED AND UP TO DATE ON OUT WHAT KINDS OF COMPLIANCE OF PROCEDURES THE STATE WILL BE REQUIRING SO THAT WE CAN MEET THOSE. SO THAT'S THE. THOSE THE ONE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND OTHER THAT WOULD AGAIN BE OVER TWO YEARS IT WOULD BE THAT IN THE TWENTY CAPITA ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THE TWENTY COUNTIES. SO THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE ISSUE THAT MY COLLEAGUE TOM RENT FREE MENTION FROM THE COUNTY BEAVER HEALTH DIRECTORS WHICH IS THE COUNTY OF SERVICEMEN COUNTY OF. RESPONSIBILITY UP FROM. PEOPLE COME TO OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THE COUNTY DID THEY REALLY DON'T. DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT THERE IN ORANGE COUNTY OR. A LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEY GO TO THE NEAREST PLACE THAT THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH. AYE IS SOMETIMES AS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY OR AS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO. AND SOMETIMES THOSE BORDERS ARE. A STREET THAT DIVIDE ONE COUNTY FROM THE OTHER. THE TREATMENT PROGRAM MAYBE ACROSS THE STREET BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ONE COUNTY THEY HAVE TO GO TRAVEL AN HOUR OR TWO. TO. RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THAT WE JUST DON'T THINK MAKES ANY SENSE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PROVIDER. IT ALSO DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AND MAY WORK IN AN AREA THAT IS CLOSE TO A TREATMENT PROGRAM BUT THEY MAY HAVE TO TRAVEL. UP BUT THAT JOB MAYBE AN HOUR FROM THEIR HOME. BUT IT'S CLOSE TO THE TREATMENT PROGRAM AND IT MAY BE JUST IN ANOTHER COUNTY SO. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE WE'VE LAID OUT A COUPLE OF. ALTERNATIVES THAT WE THINK MIGHT WORK BUT WERE OPEN TO ANYTHING THAT WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUES SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TRAVELING OR BEING DENIED SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT. COUNTY IN THEM NOT AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME IS IT WHERE SO. I SO I THINK THAT'S. A THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE FOR US ALSO. A AYE AND THEN. A THE THIRD ISSUE IS THE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALS ARE LEADING A COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROGRAMS. FOR A COMPLICATED ISSUE SO. WITHOUT. A THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN DECEMBER ISSUED IN INFORMATION BULLETIN THAT IDENTIFIED THREE SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. THAT ARE COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT. A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE. ORGANIZATIONS UNDER A FEDERAL IRS. A THEY HAVEMISLABELLED THEM AND HAS PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. OR. PRISONS. BECAUSE A NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. RECEIVING TREATMENT AND WHO RESIDE IN US TREATMENT PROGRAMS. OUR IN THE CDC OURS. PRE RELEASE TREATMENT PROGRAM. THERE'S BEEN A DECISION MADE IN AND RIGHTLY SO BECAUSE OF THE STATE LAW THAT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHO ARE IN PRE RELEASE. ARE. STILL. UNDER JURISDICTION OF CDC OUR AND THEY ARE INELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL THEIR MEDI CAL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE THEY STILL ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE. A CDC ARE HOWEVER THERE'S A MIXED POPULATION IN OUR COMMUNITY TREATMENT PROGRAM STE. AND. THE FACT THAT THE TREATMENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. AS A PRISON. MAKES ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU LIVING AND OF APART PARTICIPATING IN THE TREATMENT PROGRAM. POTENTIALLY INELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE. BECAUSE OF THE DESIGNATION THE ADDRESS THAT MEDICARE ALL ELIGIBILITY GOES BYTHE ADDRESS. AND THE THE INFORMATION BULLETIN IDENTIFIES THE THREE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITH THE ADDRESS SO. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT CATEGORY OF PERSON IS LIVING AT THE FACT THAT THE ADDRESS. UP IS IDENTIFIED AS A. MISIDENTIFIED AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. A THEN EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN STATUS IS POTENTIALLY INELIGIBLE. CDC ARE WE'VE ESTIMATED THERE'S APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WHO ARE CDC ARE? ARE UNDER CDC ARE JURISDICTION AND WE'VE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN THE DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS. HAS WORKED WITH THE. UP TO FIGURE OUT THAT THOSE ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY STILL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF. CDC ARE IN PRE RELEASE. I'M A BIG CITIES NOW NEGOTIATING A STATE ONLY HEALTH CARE PROGRAM FOR THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WILL BE SUSPENDED FROM MEDI CAL. IT'S THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT UP VULNERABLE TO BE. DISQUALIFIED FROM THERE MEDI CAL. AND THERE IS NO OTHER SAFETY NET FOR THEM AND NO PLACE ELSE THAT THEY CAN GO FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES IF THEY ARE DISQUALIFIED EXCEPT TO. EMERGENCY ROOMS AND THAT WORD AND OTHER HIGH COST HEALTH CARE. OF PROVIDERS AND THAT WE THINK IS JUST UNDERMINES THE STATE'S OUR WHOLE EFFORT OF. OF REDUCING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO TREATMENT. A SO UP SOMEHOW RATHER WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO. GET THAT RESOLVED SO THAT ARE TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHO ARE. NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED. FIVE OH ONE C. THREE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE AS THE PRISON. A IT IT ALSO FOR OUR OTHER TREATMENT PROGRAMS IS BECOME PUTS A CHILL ON OTHER TREATMENT PROGRAMS WHO MIGHT. WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CDC OUR PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS. BUT IT IT PUTS A CHILL ON THEIR EFFORTS TO EXPAND SERVICES. SO. PERSON OTHER REASON THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS BULLETIN EITHER REVISED OR. INFORMATION LETTER REVISED OR RESCINDED SO THAT IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS. DOT THE CURRENT STATUS. IT'S A. A COMPLICATED ISSUE. SO. THAT I THINK IS A FOR FOR THIS SECTION THAT IS OUR OUR THREE ISSUES THAT WE ARE. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND WOULD WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU MISS MUCH OUR NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA SHOW ON ISSUE. IF YOU HAVE NO COMMENT THAT'S OKAY TO. NEXT WILL IT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. HI SHERRY DAILY CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS REPRESENTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED. TREATMENT CENTERS AND SEVERAL LIVINGS AND THE STATE AND OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COUNSELORS I WOULD JUST URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK. AT THE WORK FORCE ISSUE AN EXPANSION REQUIRES THAT WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN TREAT ADDICTION. AVAILABLE TO US STAFF AND WORK WITH THE PEOPLE WHO COME IN THE DOORS. ANDA OCPD AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS. INDICATED THAT OUR WORKFORCE IS A DISTRESSED WORK FORCE SO. I CAPACITY EXPANSION IS REALLY IMPORTANT SUIT TO OUR CONCERNS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. WHY? HOW DID I MISS THAT AN ISSUE ONE? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. WE SEE. THAT THE TREATMENT FACILITIES. ARE WE COLLECTING COLLECTING DATA ON THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE BEING DENIED INITIAL ACCESS TO THOSE THAT ARE DISCHARGED FROM TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF THE OF THE CHANGES. SO I THINK THIS IS IN REGARDS TO THE REENTRY FACILITY YES. YES SO I'M WE ARE WORKING AND BETWEEN THAT COUNTIES. AN OURSELVES TO. READ YOU LOOK AT THE GUIDANCE THAT WE ISSUED SO WE DON'T HAVE. ANY AND DATA WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANYONE BEING REJECTED THIS REALLY WAS. AN ISSUE IN WHICH WE HAD INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE MEDICAID SERVICES BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT. ON PAROLE SO THERE WAS A VERY KIND OF FINE LEGAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM AND SO THE FACILITIES THAT WERE. IDENTIFIED IN THE LETTER CERTAINLY ARE WE DON'T DISAGREE THERE FIVE ONE C. THREES THEIR TREATMENT FACILITIES THEY'RE LICENSED AND OPERATED AS SUCH. AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO EITHER REVISE OR CLARIFY THE GUIDANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE CORRECTIONAL JURISDICTION ARE IN A RE ENTRY PROGRAM AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF. WHO HAD THIS? HAS QUITE STRONG THUNDER AND THERE ARE SEVERAL REENTRY PROGRAMS OF CORRECTIONS OPERATES SO THERE'S LIKE THE FEMALE OFFENDER PROGRAM THERE'S THE SOMETHING SOMETHING AND SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE ISSUE THE GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO. CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU HAD INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SAYING THAT THEY LIVE IN THESE FACILITIES BUT THEY WERE UNDER A CORRECTIONAL JURISDICTION SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE GUIDANCE THAT WE GIVE TO THE COUNTIES IS CLEAR WHICH IS IF YOU'RE IN A CORRECTIONAL REENTRY PROGRAM. NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN A IN THIS FACILITY OR AND. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF. HALFWAY HOUSE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT ADDRESS THAT MATTERS IT'S THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF CORRECTIONS AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON. KIND OF CLARIFYING WHAT THAT BIDEN SAYS YEAH BUT MY QUESTION WAS I AM. HAS ANYBODY BEEN DENIED SERVICE BECAUSE OF THIS NOW. THERE HAD A PERCENT CORRECT. I'M NOT AYE IT WE HAVE CHECKS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH CORRECTIONS WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROVIDERS AND. WE HAVE NO. DATA NO EVIDENCE NOT A SINGLE COMPLAINT THAT ANYONE HAS BEEN DENIED SERVICE. OKAY. I WAS INTERESTED IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT IF I COULD WE ARE DESCRIBING MORE SERVICES AND. TAKEN CARE OF MORE PEOPLE. WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING ON THE WORK FOR SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND SHOULD WE BE DOING MORE? SURE SO I THINK. THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF EFFORT UNDERWAY ON WAS A SISTER DEPARTMENT OF OURS RATE SO AWESOME IT WHICH IS OFFICES STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THEY RUN SEVERAL. WORK FORCE TYPE OF PROGRAMS I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT AND INTEREST ON THEIR PART. I'M FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS WHICH COULD SPAN THE SPECTRUM OF ALL KINDS OF AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS. WE WORK AND WE CERTIFY THE ORGANIZATIONS TWO CERTIFYING ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT THAT CERTIFIED DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELLORS THEY'RE NOT LICENSED. IN THE STATE PER SE BUT THEY ARE CERTIFIED AND WE OVERSEE THE CERTIFYING BODIES THEMSELVES. TAKING A STEP BACK FROM ALL OF THAT I THINK THAT WE. HAVE ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS AND IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA TO SPECIALTY PROVIDERS AND SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING REALLY HARD TO GROW. THE COMFORT LEVEL OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN PARTICULAR. AND THAT WOULD SPAN FROM PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS AND SO WE HAVE AN INITIATIVE UNDER WAY THAT'S USING FEDERAL MONEY. CALLED THE HUB AND SPOKE APPROACH AND SO WE HAVE. NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND FEDERAL FUNDING WHERE THE THE HUB IS A SPECIALIZED PROVIDER LIKE A NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROVIDER AND THE SPOKES ARE PRIMARY CARE. PROVIDERS AND OR CLINICS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND REALLY WHAT THE INTENT IS TO GROW THAT WORK FORCE COMFORT AND. THE AND GROW THE PIPELINE AND CAPACITY BECAUSE IF INDIVIDUALS HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEM. WHAT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IS IS? I'M GONNA HAND YOU OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS A SPECIALTY AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND I THINK THAT WE. ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE GIVEN THEN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT STRUGGLE WITH THIS DISEASE AND SO. A LOT OF WORK BETWEEN OSP HEAD AND WITH OUR FEDERAL GRANT HAS BEEN AROUND ON INCREASING THE CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PROVIDERS. THELAST THING I KNOW IS THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN EYE FOR AN INTEREST IN AND DEVELOPING PEER. SUPPORT SPECIALISTS IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK THERE'S SOME LEGISLATION THAT IS PENDING THIS YEAR THERE WERE SOME AND A COUPLE OF PREVIOUS YEARS AGO WHERE. IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO PERMITS PHOTOS IN TERMS OF YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF ON THEIR OWN STRUGGLES WITH ADDICTION AND WORKING WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE UNDERGOING A SIMILAR. PROCESS AND SO WE'VE BEEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW WOULD THAT BE. BOTH DEVELOPED FROM A CURRICULUM AND OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUNDING IS CERTAINLY OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT. HILL TO GET OVER BUT I THINK THAT ALL KIND OF GHOST YOUR LARGER QUESTION WHICH IS WE THINK THAT WE NEED MORE CAPACITY IN THE STATE AND THERE'S A. BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT ARE GEARED TOWARDS THAT. IS PRIMARY CARE THE ONLY AVENUE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TO TACKLE THIS COMPLEX PROBLEM. IT SEEMS THAT OUR SAFETY NET HAS. A MULTITUDE OF ENTRY POINTS AND I'M JUST REFLECTING BACK ON MY EXPERIENCE IN THE ER. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE I SAW WHO CAME TO SEE ME. I WONDER IF THERE'S A PLACE TO DISCUSS DETOXING IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE SUPERVISED. YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO DO THE. MORE INTENSE DETOXIFICATION THIS THAT CAN OCCUR IN I'M JUST TRYING TO WAY THROUGH. IF IT'S ONLY PRIMARY CARE THAT WERE FOCUSED ON OR OFF WERE CAPABLE OF. HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MULTITUDE OF AREAS I MEAN I THINK. IT COMES IN A MULTITUDE OF VARIOUS RIGHTS OF THE VOLUNTARY INPATIENT DETOX BENEFIT. AS US THE BEACH DAY PREVIOUSLY NOTED WAS A BENEFIT THAT WE ADDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ON IT IS ONLY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. DUE TO A LOT OF REASONS AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE AN AYE ANDY WAIVER BECAUSE WE HADN'T GOTTEN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. ON MEDICAID HISTORICALLY HAS A THE. A BIAS TOWARDS IT THEY CALLED AN INSTITUTIONAL BIAS RIGHT MEDICAID PROGRAMS IN THIS IS NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONALLY. MEDICAID FUNDS INSTITUTIONAL CARE THEY DON'T FUND RESIDENTIAL OR LOWER LEVELS OF CARE AND SO WOULD NOT BENEFIT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT WAS DONE KIND OF IN THE MINDSET OF WHAT WAS ALLOWED AT THE. UNDER THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE. THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT. THE ONLY THING I WOULD WANT TO SAY ABOUT EMERGENCY ROOMS IS THE CAPACITY FOR OTHER TYPES OF BEDS RATE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COME INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS AND A AND A SERIOUS CASE THERE YOU WOULDN'T WANNA. THERE'S A REALLY LIMITED THAT CAPACITY. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY AND I THINK THAT COMMITTEE HEARD THIS LAST WEEK. IN TERMS OF SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL AND TO IMPLEMENT THE ALLOWANCE FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND. SPECIAL TO IN A WHOLE SERVICES AN FQHC SETTINGS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE. BOTH THE BILLION AND THE PAYMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I THINK THAT THERE'S ELEVEN HUNDRED FQHCS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CRITICAL BACKBONE OF PROVIDER SUPPORTER AND CAPACITY AND SO. IT THERE'S A HOT BUT THERE'S A ROLE FOR HOSPITALS THERE'S A ROLE FOR CLINICS THERE'S A ROLE FOR PRIVATE PROVIDERS THERE'S A ROLE FOR PEER SUPPORT ANY. THERE IS A FULL KIND OF COMPLEMENT OF BOTH SERVICES AND CAPACITY THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT THAT MORE BROADLY ARE YOU KNOW ALL KINDS. PITCHING AND ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF IT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT S. BIRD. AND. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD ON OUR AGENDA WAS IS IT ONLY REIMBURSABLE AND PRIMARY CARE SAID SON I'M TRYING TO. PUSH AGAIN ON PRESS ANGLED BUT. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT WE HEARD THAT IT'S ONLY ALCOHOL SURE IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO CONSIDER WHAT. WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WANTED TO EXPAND ITS OR TO INCREASE THE SCOPE SURE. SO. STEPPING BACKTO TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN I SAID THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF BENEFITS WE HAD TO ADD AS A AS A. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ASPER WAS ONE OF THEM. AND I CAN GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF TO CONFIRM THIS BUT WHEN WE ADOPTED THAT PARTICULAR BENEFIT IT WAS USING THE U. S. PREVENTATIVE. SERVICES TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THEY HAVE A IN BE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO I THINK WE TOOK WHAT AT THE TIME WAS THE U. S. PREVENTIVE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATION WHICH WAS PRIMARY CARE SETTING. ALCOHOL AND I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ADD EITHER ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS. OR ADDITIONAL. EITHER ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS IT JUST GETS INTO THAT'S JUST A FISCAL THING WHICH IS APPROPRIATE FOR THIS KIND OF COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANTED TO EXPAND THAT. SO WAS THAT DECISION THAT AGAIN SHOWS ONLY PRIMARY CARE AND ALCOHOL TRACK AND YOU SAID THERE WERE A AND B.. UP I GUESS ALL FOLLOW UP AT A DIFFERENT TIME IF I CAN. I WANTED TO TRANSITION IF I COULD TO COUNTY OF SERVICE RECESS COUNTY OF RESPONSIBILITY. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE ALSO STILL COUNTY LINE. BUT. I'VE SEEN THIS ONE TOO MANY TIMES YEAH AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S A STATEWIDE FIX AND LOOKING FOR. REAL ANSWERS IT. IT SEEMS THAT. THE ADVOCATE BEFORE IT SAID THAT THERE WERE THREE THAT THEY PLACED ON THE TABLE. IS THERE SOMETHING AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SO THAT WE'RE NOT. REINVENTING THE WHEEL EACH TIME A COUNTY IS LOOKING TO TO THE US SURE SO ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY NINE BY A FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIDLEY THOMAS WAS. SUPPOSED TO BE THAT FIX. I THINK IT WAS MULTI YEARS IN THE NEGOTIATING I THINK IT IS STILL FAIRLY NEW I BELIEVE IT WAS SCIENCE TWO SESSIONS AGO. BECAME. EFFECTIVE MAYBE A YEAR A YEAR AGO LAST JANUARY NOT THIS PREVIOUS JANUARY. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THERE'S THE AB TWELVE NINETY NINE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH ESSENTIALLY SAYS WHENEVER AND. RECEIVES SERVICES AND COUNTY IT IS THAT COUNTIES RESPONSIBILITY TO. PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. AND I'M SIMPLIFYING IT VISITS COMPLICATED AND THERE'S ALSO THE INTERACTION WITH COUNTY REALIGNMENT SO WHEN WE DID REALIGNMENT AND TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND THAT WAS THEN CODIFIED BY THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND PUTTING INTO THE CONSTITUTION THE RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE IN THE. REVENUE SOURCES. THE COUNTIES ARE NOW PAID. THROUGH THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT. FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ARE ONE OF THOSE AND SO THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THEM FOR THOSE SERVICES. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING I THINK ARE THE GROWING PAINS. AND STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE WRINKLES BETWEEN COUNTY OF RECORD COUNTY OF SERVICE. YOU HAVE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ARE. MORE WILLING AND CAPABLE OF CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS AND DOING THAT. WE ALSO STRUGGLE WITH OTHER PROVIDERS ARE OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT AS NIMBLE WHEN IT COMES TO CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS AND SO WE HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE. TO THE COUNTIES ON THROUGH OUR SIDE ON THE INFORMATION NOTICE. I THINK I'M AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PROVIDERS AS WELL TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT COUNTIES HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS AREA IT IS STILL NOT. AB TWELVE NINE NINE DIDN'T NECESSARILY SOLVE ALL OF THOSE THINGS IMMEDIATELY AND SO WE'RE STILL KIND OF COMMITTED TO. TRYING TO WORK THROUGH WITH BOTH THE PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTIES AS TO HOW THEY SHOULD BE BOTH CONTRACTING WITH EACH OTHER AND ARE PAYING FOR SERVICES. IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE DOING ON THE SHORT TERM TO HELP WITH THAT IT'S THIS. JUST GROWING PAINS GETTING THROUGH TWELVE NINE TO NINE ARE IS THERE SOMETHING STATUTORILY. THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. IT ALSO HAS RAMIFICATIONS NOT JUST ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IT HAS. RAMIFICATIONS ON THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE OCCURRING TODAY. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. IMPLEMENTING THEIR CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND. TURNING GROUP POEMS INTO SHORT TERM THERAPEUTIC. PROGRAMS. THOSE ES CHARITY PEAS AS THEY'RE KNOWN I'M ARE GOING TO BE IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND CHILDREN FROM DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE GONNA BE PLACED IN S. YOUR TEEPEES AND SO THIS. ISSUE AROUND COUNTY OF RESIDENCE IN COUNTY OF SERVICES ALSO VERY MUCH. A BIG DISCUSSION ITEM AND SO WE WILL BE AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THE COUNTIES BOTH ON THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE. AS WELL AS ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE ABOUT THOSE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE SAME. KIND OF TENSION APPLIES ON THE SUBSTANCE YOU SIDE AND SO I'M SITTING IN BOTH CONVERSATIONS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE. COLLECTIVELY HAVE A. I THOUGHT AROUND STATUTORY IMPROVEMENTS BUT CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE IDENTIFY SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THAT. MORE AND NIMBLE IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE FUNDS GET EITHER. RELEASE DISTRIBUTED OR HOW CONTRACTING CAN BE BETTER DONE I THINK. WE WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE. IRV. A PLEASE NO. WELL THAT WAS MY. OKAY SOME. MY FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN AND I. ALWAYS TALK ABOUT OUTCOMES BUT REALLY I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE DRIVING FOR WITH OUR. CURRENT STATE PLAN WHICH OUTCOMES ARE METRICS ARE WE. WORKING ON IN RELATIONS TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT ARE MAKING DIFFERENCES AND. OUR WE TRACKING ALMOND AND WHEN DO WE EXPECT OUR FIRST DATA POINTS BACK YEAH GREAT QUESTION. SO THE COUNTIES THAT ARE. DISSIPATING IN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AS A CONDITION FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND FOR BEING A WAIVER WE HAVE TO DO AN EVALUATION. SO. UCLA IS OUR. DESIGNATED. ENTITY THAT WILL BE DOING THAT OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION SAID THEY HAVE BEEN. BOTH RECEIVING AND GETTING DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING IN TERMS OF. DOES THIS EXPERIMENT WORK IS WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD. TEST CASE IN CALIFORNIA NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING IT VERSUS COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE USING THE. THAT. KEPT. BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE IN THE COUNTIES WHERE THE WEAVER EXISTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES IT IS A CASE IT IS LIMITED TO THE RESIDENTS OF THAT COUNTY SO IF YOU ARE AND. I'M FOR SAY. ORANGE COUNTY AND YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN LA COUNTY'S WAIVER IT'S LIMITED ONLY TO THE. RESIDENTS WITHIN THAT COUNTY IF. SERVICE AND THAT'S THAT WAS VERY MUCH. SPECIFIC TO THE FEDERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE WAIVER. SO I THINK THAT ON SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE IN THERE IN TERMS OF. POSITIVE OUTCOMES. REDUCTION IN UTILIZATION OF E. R. I'M CERTAINLY WE ARE TRACKING CLOSELY AND. YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LATER AND I I LIKE TO GIVE THEM PROPS ON THEIR APPEAL A DASHBOARD. SO WERE ALSO YOU KNOW AS A STATE INTERESTED IN. EITHER THE. OVERDOSE OR DEATH RATES ASSOCIATED WITH OPIOIDS THE REALLY KEY INDICATOR WE OVERSEE THE AND DO YOU AYE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE SO WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY RATES OF. ARREST LATE IN A BECAUSE OF IMPAIRED DRIVING SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT METRICS THAT WE USE ARE THEY ALL KIND OF ROLLED UP INTO ONE NEEDS. DASHBOARD PROBABLY NOT THE OPIOID DASHBOARD IS ONE THAT I THINK IS REALLY GOOD BUT THE. EVALUATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TERMS OF THE PLAN BY UCLA AND SO I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU IS AS WELL AS BECAUSE THAT'S CRITICAL TO GETTING. CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THOSE FUNDS IS SHOWING THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS. SOMEONE WHO RUBIO. THIS IS ALL ABOUT FUNDING. WHEN I WALKED IN THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE DIFFICULTIES AND AND SOME OF THE OPERATORS BEING PAID CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THAT THE HOLD UP IS. WHICH. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. WHICH WHICH WHICH TO SLIP UP PROVIDED COULDN'T. IT WAS JUST ON THE COUNTY OF RESPONSIBILITY VERSUS THE COUNTY OF RECORD WHICH IS WHAT THAT THAT'S THE TWELVE NINETY NINE ISSUE THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT. SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THAT'S JUST WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WRITER BUDDIES I DIDN'T HEAR THE FIX THOUGH I I IT WASN'T SPECIFIC IT WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF INFORMATION BUT. IS THERE A SPECIFIC FIX OUR IS OUR TIMEFRAME IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I THAT WE CAN EXPECT AND I IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES. DO YOU EXPECTED FOR THIS WE FIX THIS YEAR WHAT YOU EXPECT. AND I THINK A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON THE I'M SO THE LAWS THE LAW RATES OF THE STATUTE THAT WAS PASSED COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AND WAS CARRIED BY MR RIDLEY THOMAS WAS WHAT'S CLEAR IT SAID THAT THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE SERVICES I THINK THAT WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING AS MUCH ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INTENTIONAL EFFORT INTO WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES WHO DO HAVE THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND HAVE THE REALIGNMENT FUNDING. TO DELIVER THE SERVICES I THINK WE. WORK CLOSELY WITH THE PROVIDERS AND THE COUNTIES TO TRY TO HELP BRIDGE THOSE COMMUNICATION GAPS AND KIND OF CREATE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE BUT. WE DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION AS A STATE BECAUSE THE FUNDING IS NO LONGER OURS TO ADMINISTER AND THE CONTRACTS ARE NO LONGER OURS TO. EITHER DEVELOPER EMPLOYMENT THERE BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN THE PROVIDERS AND SO. WE CAN ENFORCE THE LAW THE WAY IT IS BUT I THINK WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO. HELP. HELP THEM CREATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS I DON'T HAVE A. THAT NECESSARILY A SOLUTION OR A TIME FRAME SO YOU SAW IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE AND THEN THERE AND FROM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GUYS SERVICES ARE BEING PAID FOR SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST BASICALLY. NOT RECEIVING THE SERVICES NO I WOULDN'T I WOULD NOT SAY THAT. ON THE SUBSTANCE YOU SIDE IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH THE COUNTIES TO. VALIDATE THE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE CERTIFIED TO PROVIDE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SERVICES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BILLION THROUGH OUR SYSTEM. I THINK THAT THAT COUNTIES HAVE ALSO. BEEN HEARING FROM BOTH THE PROVIDERS AND US AS A STATE TO SAY YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRACT WITH THE PROVIDERS TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. AND I THINK WE HAVE HAD. VARYING DEGREES OF. RECEPTIVITY FROM THE COUNTIES I THINK THAT YOU HAVE SOME POLITICAL. ON ISSUE SOMETIMES IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES WERE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS MAY OR MAY NOT. WANT TO CONTRACT FOR THE SERVICES I THINK SOME COUNTIES ARE LESS AND SOPHISTICATED IN THEIR CONTRACT IN A PRESS I CAN YOU CAN YOU REPEAT THAT SO THAT THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO TO CONTRACT FOR THE SERVICES BUT YET THEY WERE RECEIVING THE MONEY. SO THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE MONEY I'M SO THOSE COUNTIES ARE. GOING TO BE PUT UNDER A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BY US WHEN WE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH ONE PARTICULAR COUNTY WHERE WE'VE SAID IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THIS AND THEY HAVE. DECLINED AND SO WE'RE GOING TO THERE IS A MECHANISM IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO TAKE THE FUNDS OUT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR HOUSE OF ACCOUNT AND DELIVER THE SERVICES ON AROUND. AND THE ENTIRE STATUTE THAT ALLOWS RIGHT AND THEN. CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE STATUE OF RELATES LIKE HOW LONG. DO WE WAIT UNTIL WE HOLD THESE COUNTIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING. NOT HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU A FIFTY HAVING LATELY AND NOW THAT YOU. IS IT A YEAR IS A TWO YEARS THAT THAT WE HAVE. THERE. THIS COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT PROVIDING AND NEEDING TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PUBLIC SIX MONTHS. AND WERE AT THE END OF OUR LIMITS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH IN TERMS OF DELAYS SO SO SO FOR ANY OTHER COUNTY DOES THE SAME THING WOULD YOU EXPECT SOME KIND OF. ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS TO HAPPEN WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THEM NOT DELIVERING THE SERVICES THERE ARE MECHANICAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK OUT WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE STATUTES VERY CLEAR. ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COUNTY REFUSES TO ADMINISTER A CONTRACT FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOUSE TO WE HAVE TO MAKE A FINDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN THE STATUE LAYS OUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECEIVES? AND CAN TAKE MONEY FROM THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT WITHIN AND AND IN TERMS OF THAT SO BEFORE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED SO THEY THEY WERE FIGHTING THE SERVICES ARE WE WERE PROVIDING THE SERVICE THE STATE WAS PROVIDING DIRECT. SERVICES OKAY AND NOW THAT THE MONEY'S BEEN TRANSFERRED THERE JUST AND REFUSING TO DO THE TRACKS IT SAYS. IT WAS OF IT SAID NADA. NOT A BAD THING IT WAS JUST A NATURAL AND. DOCTOR OF HOW REALIGNMENT WORK TRACE OF THE STATE WHEN THEY DID THE REALIGNMENT DEAL SAID THESE ARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE DELIVERED AT A LOCAL LEVEL. AND AS A RESULT OF THEM BEING DELIVERED AT A LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S A DEDICATED REVENUE SOURCE THAT COMES TO THEM TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES. AND WE KNOW WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND OBVIOUSLY FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND SOME COUNTIES HAVE. DONE THAT AND OTHER COUNTIES HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOWER AND SO WE TRY TO WORK ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BASIS FIRST AND. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF HELP PEOPLE ALONG AND THEN IF IN THIS CASE WE HAVE ONE COUNTY THAT HAS JUST NOT COOPERATED AND SO THERE. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT HAPPENED SO SO IF THE MONEY IS I'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM FROM THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE IS BACK TO. WRITING THE SERVICES WE WILL TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF THE COUNTIES ACCOUNT. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND BUT BUT THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING ARE NOW I'M I'M PRESUMING THAT THAT SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED WITHIN THAT COUNTING FROM STIFF FOR WITH THE COUNTY THEY'RE GETTING SERVICES THROUGH PROVIDERS IN OTHER COUNTIES OKAY AND SO THAT IS THE THAT IS THE RUB IS THAT SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS. ARE WE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE FUNDING BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY IS NOT WANTING TO. PAY FOR THEM AND SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN RIGHT THAT IS WHY WE ARE IN THIS SO WE HAVE THE ASSURANCE THAT EVEN. THAT BAD OF FOLKS ARE GETTING TREATMENT AND ABOUT WHETHER THE COUNTY PAYS SOME OF THE STATE PEACE SOMEDAY WE'LL GET PAID FOR THOSE SURPRISE. MY BOTTOM LINE SOME BOTH MY STAFF AND OTHERS IS PEOPLE NEED SERVICES THEY ARE. ENTITLED TO THE SERVICES BECAUSE WE RUN AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM AND SO THEY'RE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE. AND WE WILL TAKE CARE OF IT AND THEN IF WE NEED TO BACK OUT MONEY FROM THE COUNTIES ON THE BACK AND THEN WE'LL DO THAT THAT WERE NOT IN THE. BUSINESS OR INTEREST OF HAVING SERVICES GET TONIGHT WHAT AB AND NOW MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT IN THE MEANTIME. Y. WHERE YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THIS. PROCESS TO IT FOLKS HAVE A MAN GETTING. EITHER SERVICES OR PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN PAID FOR SIX MONTHS ITSELF I'M A PROVIDER I'M DISCOURAGED I THINK WAS SAID EARLIER I'M DISCOURAGED FROM PROVIDING SERVICES BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOTTEN PAID. AND THEN IF I'M. THIS YEAR OF A BENEFICIARY OF THESE SERVICES I'M NOT GETTING THE SERVICES BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME. THE THE PROVIDERS ARE BEING SKEPTICAL THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET PAID SO SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THERE'S SOME FOLKS THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING TREATMENT. IS WHAT. KIND OF I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. COUNTY BY COUNTY PROVIDER BY PROVIDER BASIS ON CONTRACTING ISSUES AND SO I'M AT THIS POINT IN TIME I AM NOT AWARE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING SERVICES BUT IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT CONTRARY AND HAPPY TO FRIGHTEN ANNOYED SO I WOULD LIKE. TO SEE IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OFNO I AND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE SOME KIND OF A DATABASE I WOULD. PRESUME THAT THAT TELLS YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERVICE AND WE CAN COMPARE FROM THE LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO. BE OUT IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES HAVE WE SEEN AN INCREASE AYE AND SERVICES OR AN INCREASE AND. YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT THESE FOLKS ARE HAVING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING SERVICES OR IS THERE ANY NO EVIDENCE OF OF. OVERDOSES OR DEATH BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED TO WE KEEP ANY KIND OF IDEA LIKE THAT. SO THE OPI DASHBOARD THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER THAT'S MAINTAINED BY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SHOWS OPIOID OVERDOSE AND DEATH RATES BY COUNTY HOME. I THINK GIVEN THE. DOES IT DO A COMPARISON FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE COULD NOT BELIEVE SO BUT I WOULD. I WOULD CERTAINLY DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE DON'T HAVE A WE KNOW HOW MANY UNITS OF SERVICE THAT WE'VE DELIVERED ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. SO FOR EXAMPLE ENOUGH IN THE DATA THAT I CITED EARLIER. FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED UNDER THE ODS WAIVER. THEY'VE DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION UNITS OF SERVICE AND THAT COULD BE RESIDENTIAL THAT COULD BE OUT PATIENT COULD BE MEDICATIONS HAS TO TREATMENT. I'M ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS WE CAN SAY YEAR OVER YEAR HOW MANY UNITS OF SERVICE WERE DELIVERED. BUT IT ALSO. IS INCLUSIVE OF ALCOHOL OTHER SUBSTANCES I'M SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO OPIOID SO THERE'S THERE ARE. HOW MANY UNITS OF SERVICE HAVE BEEN DELIVERED BY THE COUNTIES. I THINK. WOULD REDUCE WHICH. I KNOW I SAID LAST QUESTION BUT THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION. REGARDING PROP SIXTY FOUR IT CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHEN WE EXPECT TO START COLLECTING REVENUE SPENDING PRIORITIES. TO SOME OF THE GENERAL QUESTIONS WE HAD THE AGENDA SO CHRIS CUT FROM FINANCE. I BELIEVE THE BUDGET YEAR AND I DON'T HAVE THAT FORGIVE ME I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OF FROM ME BUT I BELIEVE THE BUDGET YEAR DOES. REFLECT SOME REVENUES COMING IN FOR. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. SPECIFICALLY FOR DH CSO THE BUDGET HERE DOES NOT REFLECT ANY REVENUE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT DEPARTMENT SO BASED ON THE TAX THAT THE. THE LAW THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED. THERE'RE A PRIORITIES TO WHICH WHICH DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE FUNDING DHS BEING NOT IN THE TOP PRIORITY BUT ONE OF THEM. ON THE LOWER END OF THE SPENT ON THE PARTY LIST. AND SO THEY HAVE. THOSE ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AT THIS TIME. FOR. THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR HAVE WE ARE IN THE START TO DIG TO SET SOME OF THOSE. PRIORITIES ARE WE. LETTING THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION DECIDE. HOW IT YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S IT'S A TWO IF IT'S A TWO PART PROCESS RIGHT SO FINANCE? WILL OBVIOUSLY ASSESSED ALL THE REVENUES THAT COME IN ON PROP SIXTY FOUR AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER BUCKETS THAT HAVE TO BE FILLED BEFORE IT COMES DOWN TO OUR AND BUCKET. I THINK THEN THAT. INITIATIVE BOTH CONTEMPLATES AND THIS IS OUR PROCESS AND THOUGHT GOING FORWARD IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE KIND OF BROAD STAKEHOLDER. GROUPS AROUND WHAT THAT MONEY COULD AND SHOULD BE USED FOR BECAUSE I THINK THE INITIATIVE KIND OF OUTLINES BROADLY WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR. BUT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION. IF IT'S YOU KNOW AND I'M MAKING UP A NUMBER OF ITS NINE MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT YOU COULD USE WITH THOSE FUNDS AND SO I THINK. I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WAITING FOR THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION IS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A NUMBER TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE YOU SPEND THE MONEY BECAUSE IT HELPS ALSO. ON SET EXPECTATIONS AND SOME KIND OF FISCAL BOUNDARY AROUND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE FUNDING SOURCE. SO I THINK I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS THAT THE INITIATIVE LAYS OUT IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO DEVELOP SOMETHING. WHETHER IT BE USED IN TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OR A COMBINATION ON THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY WE HAVEN'T STARTED THAT YET BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T. HAD IN IT ANY. CONCRETE FISCAL NUMBERS TO TALK ABOUT TO. PLEASE. NO I JUST. SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO ESTIMATES FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BECAUSE WE DON'T ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE ANY FUNDING NOT WHERE I DO. DO WE HAVE ANY ASSUMPTIONS FOR WHAT. WOULD BE THERE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ORDER THOSE ONLY COME AFTER A YEAR'S WORTH OF RECEIPTS SO THAT WE CAN THEN. PREDICT BASED OFF OF THAT'S CORRECT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A MULTI YEAR HOW LOOK FOR REVENUE PROCEEDS SPECIFIC TO PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. YEAH THAT THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING TO FOR HIS AND WOMEN RUBIO YEAH I JUST WERE ARE GOING BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL CONVERSATION IS THERE A REMEDY. FOR THE COUNTY OF SERVICE. VERSES THE KIND OF COUNTIES. THE PAYMENT BASICALLY IS A IS ARE WE GOING TO PAY BUT COUNTIES. THAT PROVIDED THE SERVICE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY IS THERE A REMEDY FOR THAT. OKAY SO GOING BACK TO THE. COUNTY OF. OF SERVICE VERSUS THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. THERE'S SOME DISPUTE AS TO WHO'S GOING TO PAY IN THE MEANTIME SOMEBODY'S NOT BEING PAID HOW IS ARE WE HANDLING THAT. SO. IT'S NOT A DISPUTE AS TO WHO'S RESPONSIBLE RIGHT THE STATUTE IS CLEAR AS TO HOW MUCH COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE. ON THE MECHANICS THAT I REFERENCE THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH WITH FINANCE IS. I'M THE STATE MAY FRONTS THAT PAYMENTS. FOR THE PROVIDERS BUT WE WILL REIMBURSE OURSELVES USING THE COUNTIES FUNDING RIGHT RIGHT SO SO IF I'M I'M THE COUNTY THAT PROVIDED THE SERVICES AND. IN THIS CASE NAY IN MY AREA I'M CLOSE DECEMBER NINETEEN OH COUNTY AND LA COUNTY. SOLD SO IF THERE'S A DISPUTE THEN YOU WILL PAVE WHOEVER. IS. WHO THAT WHATEVER THE? PERSON THAT ARE IN WE WILL REIMBURSE OURSELVES RIGHT FROM THE COUNTY OKAY FROM THE COUNTY'S POT OF MONEY THAT. OKAY. AND IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN I'M ASKING FOR TIME FRAME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT FOLKS TO BE DISCOURAGED. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID AND SO IS THAT GOING TO BE IN A TIMELY MANNER AGAIN COUPLE MONTHS SIX MONTHS WHAT THE DIRECTOR NOTED WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH A LOT OF THE MECHANICS AND HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK NOT ONLY. WITH THE COUNTY WITHIN THE CAMP BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO WITH FINANCE AND WHAT THE SCO. TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRACKING THOSE FUNDS AND AND. RECORDING THEM APPROPRIATELY. PEOPLE WILL GET PAID I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHERE YOU HAVE TO COUNTIES THAT OUR WAIVER COUNTY CIVIL SABATINO AND LA ARE NOT PART OF THIS ISSUE OKAY. RIGHT NOW USE THOSE EXAMPLES TO BECAUSE I'M ON THE LINE COUNTY DOES A GOOD EXAMPLES BECAUSE THERE'S A WAIVER COUNTIES OKAY. THANK YOU. SEEING AS WERE ONE HOUR INTO OUR HEARING IN SALON ISSUE ONE. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO. FAMOUS CARE. THIS WILL LEAD US INTO OUR SECOND HOUR. I WANTED THE OPPORTUNITY Q.. AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ON ALLOWING US TO PRESENT ON THIS. AYE TODAY REPRESENTING ON. TO APPROPRIATE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET FOR PILOT PROGRAM ABOUT PLACING A CERTIFIED DRUG OR ALCOHOL COUNSELOR IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND APARTMENTS ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S REAL GOOD REASON FOR THIS AND WE KNOW THAT PLAN AT THAT AND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FOLKS WHO END UP EMERGENCY ROOMS AND UP THERE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THEM WHAT WOULD YOU AND I MAY CONSIDER. AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY SOME DRUG RELATED. SUMMITAND REQUIRED. COUNSELORS I DO MENTAL HEALTH CARE ISSUES OPTICAL IN AREAS THAT I REPRESENT LIKE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WHERE YOU HAVE A HEAVY POPULATION. OF FOLKS WERE HOMELESS AND WHO ENTER AND. COULD SEEK. THAT BUT I'M COULD SEEK. MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OR DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELING AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER USE IN FACT. THE DATA DEMONSTRATES I DURING THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL. ENCOUNTERS WITH THESE COUNSELORS OTHERS LESS PERCENTAGE OF A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY RETURN TO THAT SAME HOSPITAL MORE PARTLY BECAUSE I'M ON A PATHWAY TOWARDS SUCCESS. THINGS CHAIR. DOCTOR MULLIN. I MAYBE MULLIN I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND I'M AN EMERGENCY DOCTOR. THERE WERE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION E. R. VISITS INVOLVING DRUG ABUSE AND MISUSE. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT NUMBER FOR A SECONDS IT DOES NOT COME NEAR COUNTING CAR ACCIDENTS SUICIDES INFECTIONS AND OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG ABUSE. SAM SAID ESTIMATES TWENTY MILLION ADULTS SUFFER FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT NUMBER EITHER BECAUSE I CHALLENGE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WHO DOES NOT KNOW SOMEONE WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN. SILENTLY TORN APART BY ADDICTION. I SAW THESE PATIENTS EVERY DAY AND I SAW THEM SPIRAL AND THEIR LIVES ON RAVEL AND I WAS ON ABLE TO INTERVENE IN ANY WAY. I'M NOT CHANGED FOR ME TWO YEARS AGO WE HAD A SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELOR IN MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. HE'S JUST THERE DURING THE WEEK BUT I CAN OFFER THESE PATIENTS A LIFELINE AND NOW PATIENTS THAT I USED TO SEE. MY FREQUENT FLYERS AND I WOULD WATCH THEIR LIVES UNRAVEL NOW I CAN GIVE THEM A LIFELINE AND A PATHWAY OUT. WE HAVE SEEN PATIENTS ACTUALLY SUMMER PATIENTS I DON'T SEE ANY MORE. I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT SO MANY STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO I SAW OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO GET THEM INTO TREATMENT AND NOW I DON'T SEE THEM ANYMORE. WE DO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE GOT THEIR LIVES TOGETHER WHO'VE GOTTEN OFF THE STREETS WHO APPROVED REALLY TURNED THEIR LIVES AROUND. I CAN TELL YOU THE PATIENT POPULATION THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IS A REAL VULNERABLE POPULATION. SEVENTY ONE PERCENT WERE COVERED BY MEDICARE HOW ABOUT FORTY FOUR PERCENT SELF IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS. THIRTY THREE PERCENT HAD A DUAL DIAGNOSIS SO WHERE CONCURRENT PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS. SERVICE IS A VERY BOND OF A PATIENT POPULATION THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON. YOU HAD MENTIONED MEDICAL DETOX. SO BEFORE WE HAD A SUBSTANCE USED. BEFORE WE WERE LINKING PATIENTS TO TREATMENTS. I WAS DETOXING PATIENTS IN MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. FOR NO REASON I WOULD GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LONG E. OUR STATE WE WOULD DO OUR DETOX AND THEN I WOULD SEND THEM BACK TO THE STREET ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN. SO ALL THAT WORK THAT WE HAD DONE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS GOING NOWHERE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE STATE HAS TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AT THE MOMENT WHEN PATIENTS ARE MOST RECEPTIVE. TREATMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR MARIN. NEXT WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON THE HAVE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. CALIFORNIA SPECIALIST AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTION. WERE WERE JUST HAPPY ABOUT THIS HEARING OR HAPPY MOSTLY FOR THIS PROPOSAL IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS. RETRAINING UP SEVENTY TWO IN THE CLINICS AS PART UP AND SPOKE MODEL. WE HAVE LIKE FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS WERE SPECIALISTS IN CALIFORNIA BUT EVERY DOCTOR AND EVERY SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN PEOPLE WITH ADDICTIONS. SHOULD FEEL CONFIDENT DE THE REFERRING TO SOMEONE RIGHT THERE OR TO BEGIN THE TREATMENT PROCESS BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THIS THINGS EVER GOING TO WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. MARVEL CHAIR MEMBERS SHARE IDEAS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS. AYE WE THINK THIS IS A TERRIFIC IDEA NOT ONLY DOES A A PROGRAM LIKE THIS SAVE HOSPITALS ON THEIR COST EXPENSES. IF INTERVENE EARLY ENOUGH IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE THE PERSON GENERALLY HAS BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR. LONG TERM SOBRIETY. A IN ADDITION TO THAT HAVING A COUNSELOR AVAILABLE AT A. EMERGENCY ROOM. THE CANCERS MAY HAVE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE SO WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH FAMILIES THEY CAN THEY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE THE YOUNG PERSON I HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM. IS I'M SUFFERING FROM A BIT OF BINGE DRINKING AND NEED SOME SUPPORT AND DIRECT THEM TOUR AND ON CAMPUS. CLUBBER ENVIRONMENT THAT HELPS. HEALTHY BEHAVIOR OR THEY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THAT PERSON NEEDS IMMEDIATE CARONA A THIRTY DAY INPATIENT PROGRAM SO THROUGH IMPORTANT HAVE SOMEONE THERE WHO HAS THAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE. AND FINALLY THE GOAL OF THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS INDUSTRY HAS TO. BRING TOGETHER MORE INTEGRATION BETWEEN PRIMARY CARE AND ADDICTION TREATMENT AND WHAT% BETTER WAY THAN HAVING ONE OF OUR EXPERTS THERE TO SHOW WHAT WE NOW AND AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND ALSO TO SHOW US. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THOSE THOSE CLIENTS WHO DON'T TAKE THE REFERRAL WHERE DO THEY GO WE NEVER SEE THEM IF THEY DON'T COMMON FOLLOW UP ON REFERRAL. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY AREN'T SO THEY'D BE REALLY GREAT TO HAVE OUR PEOPLE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOMS UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM BUT WHAT IS THE MISSING LINK IN GETTING SOME OF THE. WOMEN FOR TREATMENT THANK YOU. LARA THOMAS AND THE INTERIM STATE DIRECTOR FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. WE SEE THIS PROPOSAL IS BEING VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FOR OPIOID TREATMENT NAVIGATORS ARE VERY SIMILAR IDEAS INTO DIFFERENT. TYPES OF LOCATIONS AND WE SEE THEM BOTH AS WORKING TO CATCH PEOPLE WHEREVER THEY ARE AYE IN THE PROGRESSION OF THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND WE THINK THAT THE TWO WOULD WORK VERY WELL HAND IN HAND IN SUPPORT OF THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADRIN SHELTON WITH STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL WILL SAVE LIVES AND ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS. WITH A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH MICHELLE BACO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY IT'S A GREAT ONE TIME OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENT TO. IMPROVE OUTCOMES THAT'S COMMONSENSE APPROACH AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT IT THINKING. KID AFTERNOON PAULA WILL HOME REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE REASONS OUTLINED BY MANY OTHERS ALREADY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHEN MAY SHARMA HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES. SHOULD BE USE TO ADDRESS THE SECOND EPIDEMIC TODAY SO WE SUPPORT THE THANK YOU THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN VALENCIA HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL KERN MUSIC WERE THE MAKERS OF LONG ACTING MALTREXONE. ONCE MONTHLY INJECTABLE ANTAGONISED FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER. IT INDUCES AT THE POINT OF MEDICALLY SUPERVISED DETOXIFICATION. SO THE PROPOSAL MEETS THAT PATIENT POTENTIALLY BUT WERE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE RIGHT PATIENT FOR THE RIGHT PRODUCT AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO WHATEVER CHOICE THEY MAKE IF THIS PROPOSAL HELPS GUIDE THEM THERE IS A GOOD IDEA THANK YOU. GIVE. TOUCH CHAIR MEMBERS DEMAND REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF AMERICA BECAUSE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND JUST TO FINISH OFF AND OUT ON DEDUCTIBLES COMMENTS WHEN LOOKING AT THE PROGRAM THAT WAS DONE A DAVIS A COUPLE FISCAL ITEMS. WHAT THEY SAW WAS A SIXTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE POPULATION THERE RECEIVED INTERVENTION POST INTERVENTION? AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF IT LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT THE MEDICAL POPULATION. WE SAW FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WAS SPENT ON THE DRUG ALCOHOL COUNSELOR SEVEN DOLLARS WAS SAVED WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE ANNOUNCES DOESN'T LIKE JOB AT PULLING THOSE NUMBERS OUT. BUT SPECIFICALLY WE JUST LOOKED AT THE COST OF THE ACTUAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS THAT DOES NOT INCORPORATE. ANY ASPECT OF THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED INTO THE HOSPITAL WHICH AS WE KNOW IS A HIGHER NUMBER SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THIS IS A. A FISCALLY PRUDENT APPROACH TO A A BIG PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEE NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE I WANTED TO IF I COULD. HIGHLIGHT THIS PROPOSAL I HAD. THE PLEASURE OF MEETING THE COM DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR AT LAST WEEK TOMMY WHO'S WORKING HERE AND. SACRAMENTO. AND HAVING PRACTICED IN ANY ARE WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT I'M WAS HOW HAPPY HE WAS. THAT THAT HE ENJOYED HIS LIFE HE ENJOYED HIS DAY HE ENJOYED TAKING CARE OF HIS COMMUNITY. AND. HAVING BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES WHERE I FELT LIKE I WAS OVER UTILIZED AND UNDER RESOURCE THIS IS A VERY TIMELY PROPOSAL. AND ONE THAT I THINK. WILL DO GREAT FOR HELPING OUR STATE TO. POTENTIALLY DECREASE E. R. VISITS AS WAS SHOWN HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS TO SAVE OUR STATE MONEY. BY DOING APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN THE WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TODAY. AGAINST CHAIR MEMBERS. WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. OF THANK YOU FOR HEARING OUR BUDGET REQUESTS TO DIRECT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO INCREASE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT. RATE FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT M. EIGHTY. ARE A MATCH FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. AS WE KNOW OPIATE DEPENDENCE HAS BECOME A LEADING FORM OF DRUG ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT IS AN INNOVATIVE TREATMENT. PROGRAM THAT USES MEDICATIONS WITH COUNSELLING AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES TO TREAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS DESPITE. THE INCREASING SUCCESS OF MATT TREATMENTS FOR OPIOID ABUSE LESSEN TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS ARE CERTIFIED TO BIRTH PRESCRIBE. PROVEN OFFERING THE LOCKS ON TREATMENT AND EVEN LESS ARE TRAINED TO ADMINISTERED NALTREXONE. PROVIDING ACCESS TO MATT AND RURAL AREAS IS PIVOTAL IN MANAGING THE OPIOID ECHO EPIDEMIC. THEY'LL TRICKS ON WHICH IS AN INJECTABLE ADMINISTERED ONCE A MONTH BY IN FRONT OF THOSE CERTIFY PHYSICIANS OFFICE. REDUCES CRAVINGS A BLOCK STILL PRETTY HIGH FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS OTHER MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT DRUGS BICU PLAN OFFERING BLUEPRINT OFFERING LOW OXON COMBINATIONS MAY BE PRESCRIBED. BY CERTIFIED PHYSICIANS. IN ON A PRESCRIPTION BASIS FOR AT HOME USE UNDER A THERAPY AS WELL INCREASED ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY. INCREASES ACCESSIBILITY OF TREATMENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE KNOW THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS RAMPANT. IN OUR STATE HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF CERTIFIED PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA IS FAR LESS THAN WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMBAT OPIOID ABUSE. IN AN EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO BECOME CERTIFIED PRESCRIBERS OF MATT WE. NEED TO INCREASE THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT THEY RECEIVE FOR THAT TREATMENT. AND THIS BUDGET ASK WILL DO JUST THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND ASK THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO DIRECT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO INCREASE THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. THANK YOU SOMEONE OVER WALDRON WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS WHAT THE US CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. IT'S TRUE AND THE DEPARTMENT IS BEEN DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB WITH THE HUB AND SPOKE TRYING TO GET TREATMENT THE RURAL AREAS BUT IT'S LIKE A TWO YEAR. PROGRAM FROM FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE NEED ONGOING SUPPORT I'M GOING TRAINED DOCTORS NON GOING COUNSELORS AND ONGOING ABILITY TO PRESCRIBE. WEEK THINK THE FEDERAL LIMITS ARE TOO LOW RIGHT NOW ON HOW MANY CAN BE. DO IT BUT WE CAN'T AFFECT THAT IN CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO TRAIN MORE PEOPLE. THANK YOU SIR. FOLLOW WILL HOME WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. DO YOU. WHEN MEASURE BY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES WE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS ISSUE. AS CHAIRMAN JOHN VALENCIA FOR ALL KERN MUSIC ASSOCIATE WITH THE A PRIOR COMMENTS AND SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU SIR. MICHELLE POCKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. SHERRIE DEAN WITH CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS IN SUPPORT. ACUMEN. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT OR BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS. SHE MIGHT THINK. AND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP AND WE NEED. THE IT THE NOW ON THE HEAD THIS ISN'T VERY MUCH NEEDED AN INTEL THESE REIMBURSEMENT RATES GO UP IT'S VERY HARD TO INCENTIVIZE DOCTORS TO DO THE PROGRAMS. SO LOOK FORWARD TO HASH IN THE SOUND MAY. IF I MAY ASK A QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO RESPOND IN REAL TIME. WANTED TO. UNDERSTAND. THERE WERE CURRENTLY UNDER A TWO YEAR BUDGET CYCLE WITH THE FEDERAL GRANT. WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS? WHAT WHAT WOULD THIS PROPOSAL DO IN LIGHT OF THAT FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY? AND. THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS REALLY GONNA BE TO TRY AND DRILL DOWN ON TO RATES NOW. WHERE ARE WE WITH OUR CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE AND IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING? CRACK SO. THE FIRST I'M AS IT PERTAINS TO THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE CURES ACT WHEN WE APPLIED FOR THE FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS. WE HAD INCLUDES SOMETHING AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AFTER THE GRANT FUNDS WENT AWAY THAT WAS PART OF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. SO IT WAS GIVEN TO STATES WITH THE VERY CLEAR AND EXPLICIT UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE PERPETUALLY CONTINUING TO FUND THE SO. SUSTAINABILITY WAS PART OF OUR APPLICATION. IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE. PROPOSAL SO MOST OF THE. MEDICATION ASSISTED THERAPY THE RATES ARE NOT SET BY US AT THE STATE LEVEL PER SE BECAUSE THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF THOSE DRUGS ARE PROVIDED. ONLY IN THE ODS. WAIVER COUNTY'S FOR TEN THAT OR THAT CURRENTLY UP AND RUNNING AND THEY SET RATES SO THE REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE STRUCTURED UNDER THE COUNTY. I'M NOT UNDER THE STATE SO WE SET RATES IN THE NON ODS COUNTIES BUT MOST OF THESE DRUGS ARE NOT COVERED AS A DRUG MEDICAL BENEFIT SO THERE'S. AGAIN IT'S BACK TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATES AND THE COUNTIES AS IT PERTAINS TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SO IF THE STATE WANTED TO. INCREASE THESE RATES FOR THESE PARTICULAR SETS OF DRUGS IT WOULD BE. ABOVE THE PROPOSITION THIRTY COSTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ALIGNED TO THE COUNTIES FOR RESPONSIBILITY. UNDERSTOOD. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR YOU'VE BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL HAPPENED I. OWN SORRY AT THAT THERE WAS A PROPOSAL YOU HAD LAST YEAR I SAWYER STAFFER I YEAH I WILL HAVE THE HOPE BACK THE HEROIN AN OPIOID. A PUBLIC EDUCATION. THAT WAS THE. PUBLIC EDUCATION.

THANK YOU MA'AM. AS CHAIRMAN JOB WALESA FELKER MUSIC WE SUPPORT PROPOSAL AWESOME THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WANTED TO THANK GOODNESS ME SHARP FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN. AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M ABLE GRANT DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR ALL COMMITTEES WE MANUFACTURE A MEDICATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID USE DISORDER. AND I'M HERE TO RESPECTFULLY FIVE LEGISLATION THAT PASSED LAST SESSION BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED AND FUNDED. AB THREE NINETY FIVE MADE SOME KEY CHANGES TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IN ORDER TO EXPAND TREATMENT FOR OPIATE USE DISORDER DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OUR NATION IS FACING. ONE CHANGE WAS THAT ALLOWED NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS ALSO NOTICE AND TEEPEES TO ADMINISTER RELAPSE PREVENTION. MEDICATION ALSO KNOWN AS ANTAGONISE THERAPY. PRIOR TO THIS LEGISLATION AND TEEPEES WERE RESTRICTED TO USING REPLACEMENT THERAPY OR AGONIST TREATMENT. THIS WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGONIST AND ANTAGONISE TREATMENT HAVE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF ACTION AND THIS CHANGE RECOGNIZED PATIENT CHOICE RECOVERY AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE TREATMENT PROGRAMS BEING ABLE TO OFFER ALL THREE FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS. THIS WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS CALIFORNIA HAD RECENTLY BEEN AWARDED A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM SANSA TO EXPAND MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. THE GRANT SPECIFICALLY STATED THESE FUNDS SHOULD BE USED TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT BY REMOVING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS STEP THERAPY AN IMPORTANCE THIS BILL EXPANDING PROVIDER NETWORKS. IN CALIFORNIA WE CREATE A HUB AND SPOKE MODEL WHERE THE NDP'S ARE THE HUBS MEANING THEY DIAGNOSE START TREATMENT AND ONE APPROPRIATE TRIAGE PATIENTS TO SPOKES FOR FOLLOW UP TREATMENT. IN THE RECENTLY PASSED FEDERAL BUDGET ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS WERE ALLOCATED AND BASED ON PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS WE EXPECT CALIFORNIA WILL BE RECEIVING A MINIMUM OF AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO CONTINUE THE EXPANSION OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. AB NOT THREE NINETY FIVE MEANT THE HUBS COULD USE ALL THREE FDA APPROVED MEDICATIONS. HOWEVER ON JANUARY TENTH THIS YEAR TEACH CS DISTRIBUTE A MEMO TO THE ANTI PEACE STATING THAT WHILE THEY WERE AUTHORIZED TO USE THE MEDICATION THEY WOULD NOT BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED INCLUDING TOXICOLOGY. CASE MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT. YET THESE SERVICES ARE REIMBURSABLE FOR METHADONE AND BUPRENORPHINE IN THE SETTINGS TO CLEAR WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE FUNDING OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS THAT IS ALREADY COVERED AS BOTH A MEDICAL. AND PHARMACY BENEFIT THROUGH MEDICARE OUT BUT FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED TO ADMINISTER THE PRODUCT AND TO SUPPORT PATIENTS AND RECOVERY. THE COST OF COVERING THE SERVICES WERE ANALYZED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES AND BOTH CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COST TO THE STATE WOULD BE NOMINAL AND DID NOT PUT A FISCAL NOTE ON THE LEGISLATION. WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THESE IMPORTANT TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE ACCESS TO AN APPROPRIATELY. REIMBURSED FOR ALL THREE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD USE OF A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS AWARDED TO THE STATE TO COVER THESE SERVICES. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT D. H. CS DIRECT THE STATE READING RATE SETTING COMMITTEE TO SET A CODE AND APPROPRIATELY. REIMBURSED RATES FOR LONG ACTING INJECTABLE TRACKS ON SO ANTI PEACE CAN TRULY OFFER ALL THREE APPROVED MEDICATIONS TO THEIR PATIENTS. THANK YOU MA'AM. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE. HOLY MEASUREMENT HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ALCOHOL DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. HUMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON PALLO WELL HOME WITH A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND. DERECHOS SPONSOR IN SUPPORTER OF AB THREE NINETY FIVE LAST YEAR AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION WHICH IS. TO MAKE MEDICATIONS FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND TO. REMOVE ANY BARRIERS AND ADMINISTRATOR OF OUR REGULATORY TO MAKING ALL OF THOSE MEDICATIONS AVAILABLE SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL I'M ON THE CONDITION THAT THAT FUNDING PROVIDED IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE SERVICES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. FROM SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DIES FOR QUESTIONS AND. IF I CAN AGAIN. DIRECTOR CAN TASK ABOUT. THIS RATE SETTING COMMITTEE AND. AB THREE NINETY FIVE IF THERE IS A PLAN FROM OUR SIDE. SURE SO AND THE BILL. AND GOT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM US LAST YEAR AND THE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO FISCAL IS THAT IT DIDN'T REQUIRE CHANGE ANY OF OUR COVERAGE SPECIFICATION. SO THE WAY THAT THE BILL WAS INTENTIONALLY DRAFTED WAS IT WAS TO ALLOW. FOR THE NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROVIDERS TO. HAVE THE DRUG ON SITE WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES AND BE ABLE TO OFFER TO PATIENTS BUT IT WAS NOT. DRAFTED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REQUIRE US TO EITHER CHANGE OR OTHERWISE EXPANDS. OUR EXISTING COVERAGE OF THE DRUG SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO FISCAL ASSOCIATED WITH IT WAS WAY WAS DRAFTED. IF THEY IF THAT SPONSORS HAD WANTED US TO COVER AND SET THE RATE IT WOULD HAVE HAD A FISCAL ATTACHED TO IT SO THE. BILL WAS INTENTIONALLY WE WE ANALYZED IT AND HELPED WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NOT PERSPECTIVE. THE DRUG AS IT IS CURRENTLY. COVERED UNDER MEDICARE WHILE IT'S UNDER THE PHARMACY BENEFIT IT'S NOT UNDER THE DRUG MEDI CAL PROGRAM. IT IS LIMITED ON TO THE EIGHTY ONE OR NINE POPULATIONS SO FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF CORRECTIONS. AND IT IS A PHYSICIAN ADMINISTERED DRUG MEANING THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO PURCHASE THE. DRUG AND THEN WE REIMBURSE THEM AND THEN ADD A DISPENSING FEE ON TO THE COST OF THAT. SODEN NONE OF THAT HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE IN THE ALLOW ABILITY SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. I AM A BENEFICIARY WANTS THAT PARTICULAR. DRUG CAN BE ADMINISTERED IN A PHYSICIAN OFFICE THE PHYSICIAN HAS TO PURCHASE IT WE REIMBURSE ON AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION FIRST. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT AB ONE ON NINE RECIPIENT. SO CAN YOU. GET YOUR COMMENT IF I CAN BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN THEN WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS. LAST YEAR WHAT WHAT. DID IT ALLOW WHAT DID EXPAND SURE SO IN THIS THIS. THIS MY MEMORY BANKS GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR IS THAT NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROVIDERS ON OUR TIGHTLY OVERSEEN AND REGULATED BY BOTH OF US AS A STATE AND BY THE FEDERAL D. E. A.. AND THEY ARE. SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED TO CARRY CERTAIN DRUGS ON SITE WITHIN THE NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROVIDER OFFICES AND SO THIS BILL ALLOWED FOR THEM TO CARRY THAT PARTICULAR DRUG. IN THEIR. FACILITIES ON THEIR GROUNDS AND DISPENSE IT TO PATIENTS FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IS INTENDED. SO THAT'S ALL THE BILL WAS INTENDED THAT'S FROM THE STANDPOINT OF HOW WE. BOTH ANALYZE AND PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS THAT'S ALL THAT THE BILL ALLOWED. SO YOUR AND REPUTATION OF THE BILL WAS THAT IT WAS TO ALLOW. THE PRESENCE OF THIS MEDICATION WITHIN THE PHARMACIES BUT UNDER NO THE NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROVIDERS THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN A PHARMACY. CORRECT BUT THAT THERE WAS NO INTENT FOR US TO. FUND OR TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH THIS MEDICATION IT DOES ONLY TO ALLOW. THE TREATMENT FACILITIES TO HAVE THIS CAPABILITY IF YOU HAD IF THE LEGISLATURE HAD WANTED IT TO BE A COVERED BENEFIT. EITHER MORE BROADLY OR IF THEY HAD WANTED US TO DISTRIBUTE THE DRUG WITHOUT TREATMENT AUTHORIZATIONS OR IF THEY HAD WANTED TO EXPAND COVERAGE THAT WOULD HAVE HAD TO OF BEEN BOTH EXPLICIT IN THE BILL. AND WE WOULD HAVE A FISCAL ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT THE BILL IS ON PERMISSIVE ON THE PROVIDER TO CARRY THAT DRUG IT IS NOT REQUIRE US AS A DEPARTMENT TO COVER THE DRUG. USE GRANT I'M THE ONE CORRECTION ONE TO MAKE AN AND WE WE THANK D. H. CS BECAUSE IN THEIR WISDOM THEY THOUGHT THEY SOUGHT AND. DECEMBER TWENTIETH THEY ACTUALLY MADE. THAT PATROL THE LONG ACTING AND CHECKED ON THE TRACKS ON A FULL PHARMACY BENEFIT FOR ALL MEDICARE RECIPIENTS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE AB ONE OF NINE. IT'S AN THEY ALSO ACTUALLY CHANGED IT SO IT'S BOTH A MEDICAL AND A PHARMACY BENEFIT WHICH MEANS THAT THE ANTI PEACE ACTUALLY CAN BUY IT IN BILL IT. OR THEY CAN DO IT THROUGH A MEDICAL BENEFIT. AS REALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE MEDI CAL ODS SERVICES. THERE ARE TO OPTIMIZE THE FIRST OPTED FOR STDS SERVICES IS FOR METHADONE IN PEOPLE OR FUND THE SECOND OPT IN SERVICE IS FOR. LIVE TRIAL WHICH IS LONG ACTING THE TRACKS ON WHEN THE JANUARY TENTH. D. H. CS MEMO WENT OUT WE CONTACTED KAREN BAYLOR IMMEDIATELY. AFTER TALKING TO SOME OF OUR OUR FRIENDS ARE IN THE. NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND QUESTIONED HER ABOUT OKAY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE AUTHORIZED BUT THERE YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC LINE THAT SAYS THERE'S NO FUNDING ATTACHED. SHE SAID THAT IS CORRECT WHAT I SUGGEST TO YOU IS ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO RUN LEGISLATION IN THIS NEXT YEAR TO. FUND THIS LEGISLATION OR TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND BRING IT TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THERE BE FUNDING ALLOCATED. FROM THE DEPARTMENT I'M SHE THOUGHT GIVEN THAT THERE THERE WAS A NUMBER OF FUNDING STREAMS COMING IN TO. TEACH CS THAT THAT THIS WOULD BE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS ACTUALLY TO BE FUNDED SO THAT THE PRODUCT COULD BE AVAILABLE AND REINFORCED IN THAT SETTING. THOUGHTS ON THAT AND TREPIDATION I'M JUST TRYING TO. SERVICE IN ODS COUNTIES THEN IT'S A COUNTY. IT'S AT THE COUNTIES OPTION. IF THE STATE DECIDES TO MANDATE IT BENNETT'S. A REQUIREMENT THEN IT'S THE STATE'S FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS SQUARELY IN THIS COMMITTEE STIR SECTION DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO PROCEED WITH THAT BUT WE AS A DEPARTMENT DON'T HAVE OBSESSION. WE CAN AND JUST ONE THING WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM TO ACTUALLY COVER THE DRUG WITH THIS WEEK WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS THERE WHAT. WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY SEPARATE FOR THE SERVICES AND THAT'S A MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT THAN THE ACTUAL COVERAGE OF THE MEDICATIONS SO WHERE JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE WHOLE MEDICATION WAS ASKING FOR THAT VERY SMALL AMOUNT TO BE COVERED BY THE STATE. FOR THE ACTUAL SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICATION. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DYESSWILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. THINK IF. WELCOME DOCTOR SMITH. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR KAREN SMITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THINK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YOU ON THE NALOXONE GRANT DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW IN SET IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SENATE BILL EIGHT THIRTY THREE. PROVIDED THE DEPARTMENT ONE TIME FUNDING TO ESTABLISH NALOXONE GRANT PROGRAM WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE NUMBER FATAL OPIOID OVERDOSE IS IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THE INCREASED ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING DRUG NALOXONE. THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND WAS ALLOCATED TO THE PROGRAM THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH THE TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH INCLUDED THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CD PH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR NALOXONE PURCHASE AND LOCAL OF LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SEEPAGE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED THE PLOT PROGRAM BY LEVERAGING THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ABILITY TO PURCHASE NALOXONE AT A REDUCED PRICE. AND SUBSEQUENTLY OFFERED NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO ALL SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS FOR NALOXONE PRODUCT IN THE FORM OF NOR CAN NASAL SPRAY. AND FUNDING TO CONDUCT A LOCAL NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROJECT. THE GRANT FUNDED AMOUNTS OFFERED TO EACH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WERE BASED ON A FORMULA DEVELOPED TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SAVING LIVES. THE FORMULA INCLUDE INFORMATION ON EFFECTIVE NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION AN OVERDOSE READ. REVERSALS FROM THE CAT. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND IT CALCULATES A COUNTY SPECIFIC ESTIMATES NEED FOR NALOXONE BASED ON THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF OPIOID INVOLVED. OVERDOSE DEATHS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN THAT COUNTY FOR EACH OF THE PRECEDING THREE YEARS. OF THE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SIXTY HAVE ACCEPTED THE OFFER OF A GRANT. TWENTY OPTED TO FOREGO THE AVAILABILITY OF LOCAL FUNDING FOR ADMINISTRATION IN ORDER TO. PURCHASE ADDITIONAL I KNOW I OR TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL THE LOCKS AND. AND FORTY SIX LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THIRTY NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOSES OF NOR CAN. AS OF IN FACT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS OF THIS WEEK WILL RECEIVE A TOTAL OF. ANOTHER ALMOST TWO THOUSAND DOSES FURTHER SHIPMENTS WILL OCCUR IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE REMAINING ARE CANDICE'S WE DELIVERED TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE SUMMER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOSES DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM ARE THE PRIMARY GOALS THE DEPARTMENT WERE TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF DOSES PURCHASED WITH AVAILABLE FUNDS. AND ENSURE THOSE JUICES GOT TO THE PEOPLE AT HIGHEST RISK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE IN FACT IT A CRISIS. THROUGH PURCHASING NALOXONE AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WE WERE ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DOSES OVER WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE HAD IT. GRANT RECIPIENTS PURCHASED INDEPENDENTLY AND BY CONTRACTING WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WITH WHOM WE HAVE PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE ABLE TO MARKEDLY. SPEED UP THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. TO DECREASE LOCAL COSTS AND MINIMIZE DELAYS IN IN VARIOUS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WE TOOK PAINS TO MINIMIZE THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN IN AND MAXIMIZE FLEXIBILITY IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. TO ENSURE OUR THAT NALOXONE. THAT THE NALOXONE THAT THE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS ARE RECEIVING GETS TO THOSE AT HIGHEST RISK. THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM ARE CHOIR TO A HOP DEVELOP DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE THE LIVES SAVED FROM. OPIOID OVERDOSE INCLUDING BOTH PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS HEROIN AND FENTANYL. AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE PARTNERING WITH EXISTING LOCAL PROGRAMS AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THAT BOTH SERVE THE POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK HIGHEST RISK FOR ABUSE OVERDOSES. AND ALREADY HAVE FUNCTIONAL AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. ACCORDING TO THE DISTRIBUTION PLANS RECEIVED THUS FAR FROM FIFTY THREE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TWENTY FOUR SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE JUST OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOSES. SIXTY NINE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES WILL RECEIVE TALL APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND DOSES. TWENTY HOMELESS PROGRAMS WILL RECEIVE UP ALMOST THREE THOUSAND DOSES FIFTY EIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL RECEIVE ALMOST THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOSES. SEVEN JAILS WILL RECEIVE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY DOSES AND FIFTY TWO OTHER TYPES OF ENTITIES WILL RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND DOSES. THOSE INCLUDE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT CLINICS AND SCHOOLS. A LOT OF THE ASPECTS OF THE WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER INNOVATIVE AND MAKE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. FOR US THAN USUAL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL BE SUBMITTING FINAL REPORTS TO SEE PH BY APRIL FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN ON HOW THEY DISTRIBUTED THE NALOXONE. THEY WILL REPORT ON THE TYPES OF ENTITIES RECEIVE THE PRODUCT THE TARGET POPULATION AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED WHERE THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSE REVERSALS WILL ALSO BE? REPORTED CITY PH WILL COMPILE THE INFORMATION INCOMPLETE A SUMMARY REPORT BY JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT COMPLETES MY UPDATE THANK YOU DOCTOR SMITH. BERMAN FINANCE ALIONA COMMENTS ON ISSUE SIX. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. SEEN NONO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. DOC LOOKED AT. WHAT PERFORMANCE THAT ARE THAT THE SUMMER ALONSO TAKING IT SONORA CAN SO IT'S N. NASAL TODAY MISTLETOES? AND. I'M. HE SAID WE GOT A GOOD DEAL FROM. I DID YES I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO NAPKIN MATH OR HOWEVER YOU WANT THAT OF ANY FIVE DOLLARS FOR IT TO DO THIS. A PACKAGE SO I WAS UNDER FIFTY DOLLARS PER SIDE LIKE WHERE YOUR NAPKIN MATH IS BETTER THAN MINE IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S WRITTEN DOWN. THE MATH IN MY HEAD. TO CAN YOU WALK THROUGH WHAT A FUNCTIONAL NOW OXEN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES. YEAH WE MAKE SURE THIS IS REACHING OUR RURAL AREAS AND COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SOUND. I HAD THE PLEASURE WHILE I WAS IN FRESNO OF WORKING OUT A NEEDLE. SYRINGE EXCHANGE THAT WE HAD NEAR REDDING PARK AND. JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE'S STYLE OF. PROGRAMS ARE OUT THERE HELPING AND WANTED TO. THEY ARE AS I SAID IT. TWENTY NINE SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS SOME OF WHICH SERVE MULTIPLE COUNTIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. EACH LOCAL JURISDICTION THIS IS WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO US ABOUT WORKING THROUGH. AN ENTITY THAT NEW THE JURISDICTION WELL AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE DECIDING WHO SHOULD GET THE NOR CAN IN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INTO. THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WERE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHO IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY HAVE NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS AND SO. IN SOME CASES AT LEAST ONE CASE THERE'S THERE WAS NINE AND SO THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT CLINIC ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A PROGRAM. IN GENERAL WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS TO WERE TO AT HOW TO BE AN ENTITY WHO WAS ALREADY SERVING THE AT RISK POPULATION SO IN DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION HOMELESS. IV DRUG USERS. AT SAUDARA AND HAVE A RECORD OF ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO. RELIABLY REPORT BACK ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS THAT THEY WERE USING IN SOME CASES IT'S THE SAME ENTITIES THAT ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. THE. SYRINGE EXCHANGE. OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE OFFICE OF AIDS AND OTHER HITS BUT IT WAS REQUIRED TO ALREADY BE EXISTING WE DID NOT WANT TO. PUT. THE GRANT OUT AND THEN TAKE SIX MONTHS TO EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE ANYONE ACTUALLY JUST. DEVELOPED A PROGRAM THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WAS GOING TO WORK SO. I AM NOW JUST MY CURIOSITY. STORING OF. MARK CAN INTRANASAL IS IT. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE OR DOESN'T NEED TO BE REFRIGERATED MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S A ROOM TEMPERATURE DROP. IS IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT CAN STAND SOMEONE'S CAR FOR AWHILE IS THIS I'M I'M I DON'T KNOW I MEAN. IF WE'RE GIVING THIS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY CARRY ON THEIR PERSON HOW OFTEN DO THEY NEED TO BE. SO UPDATING OR REPLACING IT. SO THIS THE. THAN OUR CAN DISTRIBUTION ENTITIES ALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL WHO I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS I'VE NOT GONE THROUGH THE TRAINING. BUT THE TRAINING INCLUDES HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT HOW TO STORE THE PRODUCT. THE THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE PRODUCT FIND THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE PRODUCT ITS UTTERANCE SUITS ACTUALLY YOU DON'T YOU CAN JUST HAND IT TO ANYBODY WHO WALKS IN THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO THROUGH. A TRAINING IN HOW TO USE IT AND THAT INCLUDES LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CASE OF MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MEDICAL DIRECTION OF SOME FORMER THE OTHER AND SO. I DON'T KNOW FOR SPECIFICALLY BUT I WOULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN THANK WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AND. AS. LARA THOMAS IN STATE DIRECTOR FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE FOR A ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL FOR A LEVIN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OVER FOUR YEARS.

BAD SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN INSURE THAT FOLKS WHO ARE INJECTING DRUGS WERE COMING THROUGH SYRINGE ACCESS PROGRAMS FOR SOME OF THE FIRST IN LINE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE NEW TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

SEEING NONE I WILL. THAT. REITERATE MY SUPPORT FOR THE INITIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WILL WORK ON TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITH THE ADVOCATES HERE BEFORE US TODAY. BUT WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN FOR NOW AND MOVE ON TUITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU I THINK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND I MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE MONEY WITH WHEN WILL. I'M I WORK AT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE IN ORDER TO GIVE PEOPLE LEAVING CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. OUR OFFICE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH OFFICE OF AIDS. TO PROVIDE OVERDOSED EDUCATION. TO I INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND ALSO TWO DOSES OF NALOXONE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE OPIOID REVERSING TRIED TO THOSE WHO WANT IT UPON RELEASE. THE RISK OF A FATAL DRUG OVERDOS AMONG PEOPLE DURING THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE FROM PRISON HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE TIMES AS HIGH AS THAT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. A NORWEGIAN STUDY FOUND THAT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. OF DEATH IN THE TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE WERE FROM DRUG OVERDOSE AND IN NEW YORK CITY JAILS THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT OF DEATHS IN THE FIRST SIX WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. WERE FROM OPIOID OVERDOSES. THESE HIGH RATES OF OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE DUE TO THE FACT THAT INCARCERATION OFTEN LEADS TO A LOWER TOLERANCE THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UPON RELEASE. AND THIS IS BECAUSE PEOPLE USE LESS DRUGS OTHER CARS RATED OR NO DRUGS I HAVE AND ALSO BECAUSE THE DRUGS IN PRISON ARE USUALLY OF LOWER PURITY AND STRENGTHENS STREET DRUGS. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE A PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC RATE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS IN OUR PRISON POPULATION. PEOPLE INCARCERATING CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS ARE NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS PEOPLE IN OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PRISONS TO DIE OF DRUG OR ALCOHOL INTOXICATION. THE DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH AND TCR IS FIFTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL CALIFORNIA POPULATION AND THIS UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND EDUCATION AND ACCESS TO LOCK SEVEN. TO PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATING CALIFORNIA'S THEY REENTER THE COMMUNITY. PROVIDING A LOT THAT PEOPLE LEAVING THE PRISON AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE MORTALITY RATES TWENTY SEVEN TO FORTY SIX PERCENT IN THE FIRST WEEKS AFTER RELEASE THAT GIVE THEM TIME TO CONNECT. TO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND HELP THEM RECOVER FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND IN THE LONG TERM. OUR PROPOSAL IS MODELED AFTER REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO THE BEGINNING TWENTY THIRTEEN. THAT DISTRIBUTES PEOPLE TO ADD THAT DISTRIBUTES INTO PEOPLE LEAVING THE JAIL ANYONE WHO WATCHES THE EDUCATIONAL VIDEO CAN OPT TO RECEIVE IT. I'M PARTICULARLY IN CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS THIS IS DONE TO AVOID THE STIGMA. AND. BARRIERS ASSOCIATE WITH SELF IDENTIFYING ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AS SOMEONE WITH A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM. AT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM. THE DOPE PROJECTS DRUG OVERDOSE PREVENTION EDUCATION COORDINATES THE DISTRIBUTION OF NALOXONE IN SAN FRANCISCO JAIL LINKAGE TO COMMUNITY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE LEAVING JAIL AND PRISON. BEYOND JUST REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS IMMEDIATELY AFTER RELEASED AND THIS IS WHY WE ALSO SUPPORT THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT FROM EPA TO SUPPORT CARE NAVIGATORS AND HARM REDUCTION PROGRAMS. I'M LIKE THE DOUGH PROJECT. I REQUEST FOR TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF MARK AND THE NASAL SPRAY FORMULATION. IT COST SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS AS YOU HEARD PREVIOUSLY FOR TWO DOSES AND THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE RELEASED. FROM CDC R. COSTA EACH YEAR SO THAT COSTA THEN ARE CAN IS APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN SIX MILLION. AND THE REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE AWARDED TO COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SUPPORT OR ESTABLISH HARM REDUCTION NAVIGATION PROGRAMS THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE BEING RELEASED FROM PRESENT TO PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU MA'AM. WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE MONEY. FULLER THOMAS A DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. I I JUST HAVE ONE AND IT'S A BUDGETING ISSUE ON TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. PUBLIC HEALTH VERSUS CDC ARE SO. DUMB IS THIS A RESPONSIBILITY OF THEM LEAVING CORRECTIONS THAT SINCE THEY'RE UNDER THEIR THE BUDGET ITEM SHOULD COME FROM CDC OUR PURSES. FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR AND YOUR TO SAY YEAH AND I DISCUSSED THIS WITH SUB FIVE AS WELL AND SO THE. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS I ALSO TALK TO PEOPLE IN VARIOUS. DEPARTMENTS LAKE CITY PEACH AND I'M THE REASON IT'S. THROUGH PUBLIC HEALTH IS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO CONNECT THEM NOT ONLY TO. YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE. NOT OVER NOTHING IN THOSE THOSE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER RELEASE BUT ALSO TO CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND I'M IT'S ALSO A LOT THERE'S AS THE VERY SIMILAR PROGRAM IN NEW YORK. AND THAT IS ALSO. YOU KNOW THAT THE FOCUS IS REALLY ON GETTING PEOPLE CONNECTED TO TREATMENT AND SO WHILE CORRECTIONS IS INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THE MEDICATION. THE MAIN GOAL IS TO CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY AND BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE OF RE ENTER IN COMMUNITIES I'M. THAT ARE NOT IN THE COUNTY WHERE THERE PRISON IS. THIS IS A WAY TO TO MAKE THAT AN EASIER TRANSITION. I'M. SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TEN. THANK YOU WHEN YOUR EDITOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MULLIN THE DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS. DEPARTMENTS TO HOSPITALS OBSCENE FRIDAY OF FEEL WAS ESTABLISHED JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO MANAGE AND OPERATE THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM FOR MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS. A CALIFORNIA. WE CURRENTLY HAVE FIGHTS STATE HOSPITALS ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND TWO DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO OPERATE OVERSEE A CONDITIONAL RELEASE PROGRAM. REFERRED TO AS CONRAD FOR OUTPATIENTS. WE ALL SAID OVERSEE GEL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM WITHIN MANY MANY AND GELS THIS PLANE TIME. OTHER PATIENTS ARE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE COURTS AND BE A COURT ORDERS. THROUGH THE CDC ARE ABBIA IMHO YOU. AND ARE ALSO OUR CIVIL PATIENTS ARE THROUGH THE CONSERVATIVE PART. UNSERVED SHIP PROCESS. OVER THE PAST TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT'S POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS HAS SHIFTED FROM PRIMARY CIVIL COURT COMMITMENTS TO FRIENDS POPULATION REFERRED THROUGH THE CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM. IT'S ABOUT NINETY ONE PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION NOW AS FORENSIC IN ABOUT NINE PERCENT SEVERAL. I'VE READ OUR FRIENDS OF POPULATION IS REFERRED TO AS ARE NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY OR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS ARE MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS AND ARE SUCH A VIOLENT PREDATORS. NOT NINE PERCENT IS. CIVIL. POPULATION WHICH IS CONSERVE TO THE LANTERN MEN PETRA SHORT. PROCESS. WE LOOK AT OUR POPULATION AS SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM OR SHORT TERM ARE ARE INCUMBENT STAND TRIALS WHICH HAVE AN AVERAGE LIKE THE STATE ABOUT HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DAYS. AND ARE AM MENTALLY ILL PRISONERS WHICH ARE BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN MONTHS. THE LONGER TERM OR THE OTHER COMMITMENTS SUCH AS INDIA AYE ESCAPEES INDIOS AND LPS AND THAT THE TIMES LIKE TO FINDS VERY. WE HAVE SEVERAL TYPE TREATMENT PROGRAMS BEEN INPATIENT OUTPATIENT AGAIN OUR JAIL BASED PROGRAM AND THIS YEAR WERE ACTIVATING OUR ASSESSMENT EVALUATION STABILIZATION CENTER WHICH IS AN KERN VALLEY. AND WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING SOME DIVERSION PROGRAMS WHICH YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER. OUR CLINICAL TREATMENT INCLUDES MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL. AND WE ALSO FOCUS OUR TREATMENTS ON TRINA PATHWAYS DEPENDING ON THE COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE TREATING. WE HAVE OUR WHICH PETER PATIENTS WITH MULTI DISCIPLINARY TRAINING AND TREATMENT TEAMS WHICH ARE. PHYSICIANS PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS REHAB THERAPISTS AND NURSES WHICH INCLUDES LIKE TEX AND OURS I'M REGISTERED NURSES. WE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ONE AS I SAID WE CAME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOL THAT WE ESTABLISH A DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WE FOCUSED ON BECOMING AN ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION WE WANTED TO LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES TOWARDS EFFICIENCIES. AND. LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES SYSTEMS OF BEST PRACTICES. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE OPERATED FIVE SEPARATE AND. HOSPITALS AND OUR KIND OF FOCUSING ON ENTERPRISE AND BECOMING ONE SYSTEM. WE ALSO IT ESTABLISHED A CLINICAL OPERATIONS DIVISION WHICH WAS BRINGING OUR CLINICIANS FROM THE HOSPITAL'S I'M SUCH AS NURSES ALL OF THE DISCIPLINES THAT WE HAVE. INTO FOCUSING ON EMBRACING. I'M POLICY AND MAKING DECISION MAKING PROCESSES WITH US BRINGING THEM INTO OUR SACRAMENTO BASE HEADQUARTERS. FINALLY WE ARE NOW FOCUSING ON OUR PHILOSOPHY A LITTLE BIT BEYOND VETS. WE TALK ABOUT CAPACITY YOU HEARD US LAST YEAR TALK ABOUT CAPACITY WE HAVE WAIT LIST YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT AGAIN THIS YEAR. BUT WE NOW WE'RE LOOKING ON. BEYOND CAPACITY MEANING. LOOKING AT THE DEMAND WISER DEMAND OUT THERE WE ALSO LOOK AT OUR SYSTEMS THAT ARE EFFICIENCIES HELP WE BETTER SERVE HAVE WE BETTER MANAGE THE POPULATION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIMIT ABOUT A CAPACITY IN STATE HOSPITALS. SO WE'LL LOOK AT. HOW DO WE STRATEGICALLY POUND FOR OUR DEPARTMENT IN THE STREET CATEGORY? SO WE ALSO HAD A MAJOR CHANGE IN JULY ONE TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH I KNOW YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH AS WELL WE TOOK OUR THREE PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATED FOR MANY YEARS INSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM AND WE TRANSFER THOSE BACK TO CDC ARE. AND. I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT THEY'RE RUNNING THEM VERY WELL. WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET MY MINUTE HAVE THAT OFTEN MISS CLINTON MY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. I THINK IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT ANTI PEPPY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND I'LL START OFF WITH JUST A WROTE A QUICK BRIEF AND. HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT BUDGET AND THEN GET INTO THE PROPOSALS THAT MARK COVERED ELSEWHERE IN THE AGENDA. I AM AS JUST AS A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET ARE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TOTALS ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION FROM THE UMPIRE BUDGET. THIS YEAR WE HAVE REORGANIZED OUR BUDGET DISPLAY A MINT ADD TO IN ORDER TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN BELT BETTER ILLUSTRATE ON BUDGET DETAILS. FURTHER WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON FINANCIAL EXPENDITURES OF THE STATE HOSPITALS AND PATIENT OUTCOMES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY HONOR SYSTEM. WE HAVE AN THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES A PROPOSAL'S THIS YEAR THEY INCLUDE INCREASED CAPACITY IN POPULATION CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS I AM RELATED TO THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. WE HAVE I'M SEVERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND I'M SEVERAL CAPITAL OUTLAY CONTINUING PROJECTS AND THAT YOU'LL HEAR LATER ON IN THE AGENDA. SO FOR THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THE AGENDA OF THE FIRST IS. EVERY QUEST RELATED TO ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM. WE'RE REQUESTING TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION AND TWENTY THREE POINT TWO POSITIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION AND SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS IN. FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING FOR THE ACTIVATION OF THE REMAINING TWO UNITS OF OUR NEW ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND JUST BY WAY OF KIND OF A REFRESHER ON THE BACKGROUND ON THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. IT IN PREVIOUS YEARS BOTH IN A CAPITAL OUTLAY CAPACITY AS WELL AS AND FOR PROGRAMMATIC AND BENDING. AND SO AB THIRTEEN FORTY AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE A PILOT ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. WHICH IS TO TREAT PATIENTS ARE AT HIGH RISK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE. INTENSIVE TREATMENT PROGRAM IN A HIGHER SECURITY SETTING IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE THE PATIENT'S CONDITION REFER THEM TO THE GENERAL PATIENT POPULATION. AND THIS WAS IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHANGE IN OUR PATIENT POPULATION OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS FROM A PRIMARY CIVIL HAS CIVILLY COMMITTED PATIENT POPULATION TO. A PRIMARY FORENSIC POPULATION WHO COME WITH CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO I'M CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS AND. AT A HIGHER PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE. AND SO WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE ANY. LAST YEAR WE CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE REQUESTING THAT FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TWO ACTING UNIT ACTIVATIONS AD AT ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL THERE'S A TOTAL OF THREE UNITS PROPOSED PARKS USING. FOUR UNITS PROPOSED FOR THIS PROJECT THREE AT ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL TWO OF WHICH WERE FUNDED IN I'M THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND THIS REQUEST IS FOR THE FUNDING FOR THE THIRD UNIT OUT ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL AND THE FOURTH UNIT OUT PATENTS IN THE ONE UNIT BUT FOURTH UNIT AT PATTON STATE HOSPITAL. THIS ALSO INCLUDES. AS SAVINGS I HAVE RELATED TO IN THE CURRENT YEAR RELATED TO DELAYS IN THE ACTIVATION OF THE FIRST TWO UNITS. AND WE'VE HAD AND THAT UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS DUE TO ATTAINING STATE FIRE MARSHAL I'M APPROVALS ON THE CONSTRUCTION PLANS DUE TO THIS YEAR'S FIRE SITUATION. AND SO FOR THE THESE UNITS. WE ARE PROPOSING STAFFING ON THESE UNITS. AT A NURSING STAFFING RATIO OF ONE TO ONE POINT FIVE I'M FOR ARE IN MP TIAN AND IN PM. AND ONE TO THREE FOUR THAT NOT SHIFT AND WE HAVE MEANING I'M ENHANCE TREATMENT TEAM PROPOSES AND THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS PROVIDE. DE VERY ENHANCE TREATMENT IN THIS. IN THESE. UNITS AND WHICH ADDS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND REHAB SERVICE TO OUR NORMAL COMPLEMENT OF. OF. TREATMENT TEAM THIS INCLUDES HOSTILE PLACES OFFICERS AS WELL AS OTHER AND ANCILLARY AND STAFFING AND. OTHER POSITIONS. SO THAT IS THE ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM TO LET ME CONTINUE GO THROUGH EACH ONE OR STOP. I MAY STOP YOU ON ISSUE TEN IF I MAY AND THEN IF WE NEED TO WE CAN ADDRESS THEM AS THEY'RE COMING UP. WANTED TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN AT THIS MOMENT. THIS TREND MEMBERS COULD BE BESIDE WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT. THE SET PROPOSAL IN A. THE REQUEST FOR STAFFING. AS YOU KNOW THE SAKE TECHS WERE PART OF A COALITION THAT. WROTE THE LEGISLATION FOR THE ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM SO WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. THRILLED TO SEE THAT THE STAFFING START TO COME ONLINE AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE FACILITIES. THANK YOU. YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS RUNNING. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE I WANTED TO. THIS. QUESTION ABOUT I S. T. IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN REOCCURRING AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR A LITTLE DIRECTION IF I CAN. ARE WE EFFECTIVELY STEMMING THE TIDE AND. ARE WE MAKING HEADWIND. IN LIGHT OF WHAT NUMERICALLY WE ARE SEEING IN TERMS OF VOLUME. AND ARE WE DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT I CITIES ARE AWAITING PLACEMENT. HOW OF OUR METRICS CHANGED? SINCE THE PAST YEAR AND HOW WOULD THESE POTENTIAL PROGRAM'S IMPACT THOSE METRICS GOING FORWARD. SO AND WITH RESPECT TO THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. POPULATION. YEAH I MEAN HOLD ISSUED TEN OPEN A MOVE TO ISSUE ELEVEN WHICH IS ABOUT HIGHEST HE'S. AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOUR COMMENTS FIRST AND THEN SAVE THAT QUESTION FOR. AFTERWARDS THAT'S OKAY TOO LATE BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR COMMENTS MIGHT ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. THINKING. SO I WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE END AND COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND POPULATION AND JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AND SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND. SO IT AND BACK IT STARTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN WE BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS AND THEN A GROWING WEIGHTLESS AND. HAVE OF INDIVIDUALS PENDING PLACEMENT TO A STATE HOSPITAL. THE. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THAT GROWING REFERRAL BASE AS WELL AS THE GROWING WEIGHTLESS IN AND IN THE KIND OF THREE DIFFERENT DOMAINS. THE FIRST WHEN YOU KNOW WE START TO SEE A WEIGHTLESS INCREASE FIRST THING WE USUALLY DO IS OPEN CAPACITY AND SO THAT'S HOW WE STARTED ADDRESSING. THE CHALLENGES WITH CAPACITY INCREASES AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE OVER AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND ELEVEN EXCUSE ME FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN BEDS IN THE STATE HOSPITALS. AND OVER TWO HUNDRED BEDS AND THE JOB IS COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS OR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN BEDS TODAY. AND WITHOUT CAPACITY WE HAVE I'M SIGNIFICANTLY GROWN OUR pABILITY TO TREAT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. SO WE NOW HAVE AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS IN IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE HAD AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE. BIASED HE'S IN OUR SYSTEM COMPARED TO ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT I'M BACK INTO AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN. THE AND WE HAVE ALSO AND IT IT'S. JUST KIND OF WITH NOT ONLY CAPACITY EXPANSIONS BUT NOW I'M CUDDLING I'M SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS. AND THOSE FIGHT FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE. AVERAGE REALLY SUNSETS WERE ACTUALLY SERVING FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND. SIXTY ONE TOTAL BETWEEN OUR STATE HOSPITALS IN JAIL MAYES TREATMENT PROGRAMS NOW AND TODAY SO THERE'S QUITE A FEW. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT ARE SERVED EVEN THOUGH BETWEEN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND THE JOB IS COMPANIES TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE YOU KNOW AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THE STATE HOSPITALS AND. HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE LAST YEAR IN THE. AND THE AGE OF IS COMPLICATED IN TOTAL WE SERVED OVER FIVE THOUSAND HIGHEST HE'S IN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS. AND SO THERE'S BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INCREASING CAPACITY IN THROUGHPUT ON THOSE BEDS AND IN TURN AND TURN OVER OF WHO WERE TRAINING IN THOSE BEDS. AND LOOKING BACK JUST KIND OF WALKING BACK THROUGH THE AND THE WAIT LIST YOU KNOW IN IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IT WAS A THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHT. JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY AND TODAY WE'RE SITTING OUT. LYNN APRIL IS NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO SO WE HAVE ADDED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CAPACITY BUT CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASING REFERRAL BASE. SO THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT IT WE'RE NOT BUILDING WHO ARE WAY OUT OF THIS AND SO REALLY HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS FROM. FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE I'M FIRST FONG WERE WERE OUT OF CAPACITY WENT MONTHS WE AND MAKE THESE PROPOSALS. THIS YEAR THAT'S REALLY THE EXTENT OF CAPACITY IN THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND WE CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO THE JAIL BASS COMPENSATE TREATMENT PROGRAM BUT REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER SOLUTIONS AND SO I'M WILL TALK AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THE PROPOSAL'S BUT. AND TO THE PROPOSALS ARE REALLY AND DIFFERENT FOR US THIS YEARAND ONE BEING. A PARTNERSHIP WITH LA COUNTY TO TREAT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN THE SECOND BEING THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. WHICH IS LOOKING TOWARDS AND GETTING OUT IN FRONT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CYCLING THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. DIVERT THEM FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND BEFORE THEY COME TO US AS AN INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENT. AND GET THEM CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES THAT THE RIVER 'M SHOULD BE RECEIVING AND THE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF AND THE PROPOSALS COMING BY. THAT'S KIND OF THE THE CHALLENGES OF WHERE WE STAND FOR THE WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT WORKING FEVERISHLY TO TRY TO STEM THE TIDE AND GET OUT IN FRONT. BUT THE REFERRALS DO CONTINUE TO INCREASE. FASTER THAN WE CAN OPEN CAPACITY AND AND IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A NATIONAL TREND. WE YOU KNOW ARE IN CONTACT WITH OUR STATE HOSPITAL PARTNERS AT A NATIONWIDE AND AND. YOU KNOW NATIONALLY STATES ARE BEING SUED FOR FOR GROWING WEIGHTLESS AND AND HAVING CHALLENGES AND OPENING CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET THE THE GROWING THE GROWING REFERRALS. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE HISTORY. SO REJECTED A START WITH THE PURPLE THROUGH THE PROPOSAL'S. YES ON ISSUE ELEVEN OKAY. SO AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ON PROPOSALS. RELATED TOO INCOMPETENT TO STAND PARTNER AYE TRIAL BOTH IN THE STATE HOSPITALS IN ARE CONTRACTED PROGRAMS AND THEN ALSO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. SO AND THE FIRST I AM WE HAVE THE METROPOLITAN STATE AND HOSPITAL SECURE ABOUT BED CAPACITY INCREASED WE'RE REQUESTING FIFTY THREE MILLION AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX POINT ONE POSITIONS AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND SIXTY EIGHT. MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND FORTY SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR POSITIONS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. AND THIS IS TO ACTIVATE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX FRIENDS AT TREATMENT BEDS AT METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL TO HELP ADDRESS THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WEIGHTLESS. AND THIS IS AND THE CLERK THE CULMINATION OF SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE BEEN I'M HERE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE BEFORE IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS BOTH ON A CAPITAL OUTLAY. PROJECT TO I'M IS CONSTRUCT THE I'M SECURE TRABANT SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND IN EXISTING PATIENT BUILDING LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL WAS TO AND. TO HELP US MOVE THE EXISTING PATIENTS WHO ARE CIVILLY COMMITTED PATIENTS I AM PROVIDE US THE FUNDING TO MOVE THEM INTO AN ALTERNATE BUILDING. AND ALSO TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR. POLICE ACADEMY IN ORDER TO BEGIN TO I'M HIRE AND TRAIN THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THIS ITEM EXPANSION OF OUR SECURE TREATMENT CAPACITY. SO THERE THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL IS THE STOPPING TO REACTIVATE THE UNITS. WITH INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL POPULATION AND THE WITH THE STAFFING LEVEL BEING AT THE Q. LEVEL STAFFING FOR SYSTEM WHICH IS I'M ONE TO SIX ON ON NURSING ON THE AM AND PM. WE HAVE TREATMENT TRAIN RATIO OF ONE TO FIFTEEN WE HAVE PROGRAM SUPERVISION ANCILLARY STAFFING A PROTECTIVE SERVICES STOPPING ALL WITHIN THIS PACKAGE AS WELL. AND THE ACTIVATION TIMELINE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR THESE BEDS. WAS. EDGE OPENING ONE AT ONE UNIT EVERY OTHER MONTH AND THEY ARE AND FORTY EIGHT THAT UNITS AND THERE'S THREE FORTY EIGHT BED UNITS INTO FORTY SIX BUT UNITS. THERE'S A COMPANION PUT PROPOSAL TO DIED. FOR THE. AS DISSOCIATED. ONLY ANY OPERATING EXPENSE I'M. COSTS RELATED TO PATIENTS AND THIS IS A BASED ON AN AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE. DOLLARS OUT ON AVERAGE PER PATIENT THAT WILL WILL BE ADDING AND THIS IS FOR THE COSTS LIKE OUTSIDE MEDICAL EXPENSES. CLOTHING AND PERSONAL PLAYS I'M RECREATION RELIGION SUPPLIES FOOD AND AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS THINGS THAT ARE. IMPORTANT TO US BE ABLE DE PROVIDE THE CARE AND TREATMENT FOR THE PATIENTS. AND WE ALSO HAVE. A REQUEST TO INCREASE CAPACITY AT. COALINGA STATE HOSPITAL THIS IS A REQUEST FOR ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO POSITIONS AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETY SIX POINT NINE POSITIONS ON GOING AND THIS IS RELATED TO INCREASING CAPACITY FOR MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS. IN THIS IS BECAUSE WITH THE INC ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM. CONSTRUCTION THAT WE. JUST I'M DISCUSSED THAT WE WILL BE AND LOSING CAPACITY AT ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL BECAUSE WILL BE CONVERTING FORTY SIX BUT UNITS TO THIRTEEN BAD ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM UNITS. AND SO WITHOUT BECAUSE. ATASCADERO OPERATES AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AS THAT WOULD BE A LOSS OF CAPACITY WHICH WOULD ULTIMATELY IMPACT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO BY MOVING MENTALLY DISORDERED OFFENDERS FROM CALLING GUEST ARE FROM ATASCADERO TO CALLING ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY LEVEL FOR INCOMPETENCE STATEMENTS TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS. OUT. I'M ATASCADERO. THIS IS FOR. AS TO INCREASE CURRENTLY THEY HAVE FOR A FIFTY BED UNITS OUT. COALINGA WE'D BE TAKING OUR TIME THEM CURRENTLY FROM A CAPACITY FORTY TO THE MAXIMUM OF FIFTEEN. ACROSS EIGHT UNITS. AND THIS PROVIDES THIS THAT STAFF BEING THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO INCREASE THOSE UNITS. TO CARE FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL TEN PATIENTS PER UNIT. WE HAVE ALSO AND. SCENE LOOKING OUT OUR. PROPOSALS FOR JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAM WE'RE REQUESTING EIGHT MILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND NINE POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING TO ESTABLISH SEVEN JOB BASE COME. TREATMENT PROGRAMS THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF OUR PROGRAMS WE HAVE PROGRAMS. AT CURRENTLY OPERATING STATEWIDE WE HAVE SIX PROGRAMS THAT THIS WOULD BE SEVEN ADDITIONAL NEW PROGRAMS. LOCATED BOTH AND NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. THESE PROGRAMS WOULD RUN IN THE APPROXIMATE BEING APPROXIMATELY FROM FIVE TO TWELVE BEDS DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY. AND SO THIS IS THE FUNDING TO FOR US TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT WITH ADDITIONAL SHOULD. ES SHERIFFS AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ABOUT CAPACITY FOR INCOME STAND TRIAL TREATMENT. AND THEN FOR OUR MISSION EVALUATION STABILIZATION CENTER WE ARE JUST REFLECTING A ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR I'M SAVINGS IN CURRENT YEAR DUE TO AND. ELAINE ACTIVATION OF THE. SIXTY BED EMISSION EVALUATION STABILIZATION CENTER AT ITS ACTUALLY WILL BE ACTIVATING THIS MONTH. AND AND IT WAS DUE TO THE DELAYS WERE REALLY DUE TO THE COUNTY. PROCURE OUT OF PROCURING SEES ME CONTRACTING WITH A A CLINICAL SERVICES PROVIDER IN THE TIME THAT IT TOOK TWO. TO DO THAT AND HIRE THE STAFF SO WE'RE PLEASED AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT I GOT BACK TO PASS IN THIS NEW PROGRAM IS COMING ONLINE THIS MONTH. AND AND THEN WE HAVE OUR TO NEW ON PROPOSALS THIS YEAR WHICH IS THE. THE FIRST IS THE REQUEST FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THIS IS FOR RESTORATION SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL PATIENTS. REFERRED TO THIS DEPARTMENT SAY HOSPITALS IT WOULD BE I AM REQUESTING FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AN ON GOING AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING A CONTRACT WITH LA COUNTY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND IT WOULD BE A CAUGHT BY ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF THE LOCATIONS. INSIGHTS I WE ARE PROPOSING FIVE BEDS IN AN ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FORTY FIVE BEDS IN EITHER I AM DETERMINED TO HOW THREE HAVE CENTER TYPE LOCATIONS AND HUNDRED BEDS AND RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WITH CLINICAL ENHANCED SERVICES PROVIDED. AND THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES I'M STOPPING FOR LA COUNTY BOTH IN THE FORM OF A CLINICAL TEAM WHO WILL PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE PATIENT IN JAIL WHILE WHERE THEY ARE WORKING AND THE WORK TO STABILIZE THAT PATIENTS TO. A PREPARE THEM FOR TRANSITION INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE NAVIGATION TEAM OF TWO THREE PEOPLE TO HELP. THEY INDIVIDUALS NAVIGATE. SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AND THEN WE HAVE THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM. WHICH IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THEN THIS IS TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING JAIL DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WHO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ON FELONY CHARGES THEIR GOAL IS TO REALLY IS TO DIVERT THESE INDIVIDUALS IN TWO MORE APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS BEFORE THEY BECOME AND AND AND FOUND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL? AND THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH. STAKEHOLDERS AND I'M WORKING TO AND FINE TUNE THAT PROPOSAL FOR ME REVISION. CURRENTLY HAS ITS PROPOSES WHERE I AM PROPOSING TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PRIMARILY I'M DIAGNOSED WITH ON SCHIZOPHRENIA OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. AND SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER OR BIPOLAR DISORDER AND FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR EITHER PRE BACKING OR POST BOOKING DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO. HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS BE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY. OUR GOAL IS TO TARGET INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND I AM. AND WHERE THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE ALLEGED CRIME AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AT THE TIME IN WHICH CRIME OR THAT CRIME IS DRIVEN BY CONDITIONS OF HOMELESSNESS. I'M IN THAT THERE AND THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT POSE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISK IF TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY. AND WE ARE TARGETING A MINUTE MINIMUM REDUCTION OF TWENTY PERCENT OF ICE T. REFERRALS WITH THE GOAL OF UP TO THIRTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN REFERRALS FROM THE COUNTIES. AND COUNTIES ARE AND WE ARE PROPOSING THE COUNTIES AND PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS I'M CURRENTLY AT TWENTY PERCENT. AND A TOTAL OF. NINETY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE FUNDING IS A EARMARKED FOR THE CONTRACTS WITH THE COUNTIES I'M WE EXPAND TO SEPARATE THAT THIS WILL FUND APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED PLACEMENTS. AND WE ARE TARGETING. THE HEIGHT THE FIFTEEN COUNTIES WITH THE. HIGHEST NUMBER OF REFERRALS TO THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO SETTING SITE ME. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE FUNDING FOR. OTHER COUNTIES TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL. AND THEN WAITED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND WE HAVE PROPOSED SOME PROGRAM RESOURCE IS. WHICH INCLUDES FOR AND PROGRAM SUPPORT OVERSIGHT WHICH HAS A CHIEF PSYCHOLOGIST AND HEALTH PROGRAM SPECIALISTS ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT AND I HAVE SOME FUNDING WE HAD TO AND HAVE A RESEARCH CONTRACT WITH YOU SEE. PARTNER. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN POSAR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE HAVE THREE GROUPS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE ICE TEA PROPOSALS ONE ON THE ICE TEA WEIGHTLESS. SECOND ON THE ICY CAPACITY AND THIRD ON ICE T. DAY VERSION I WILL TRY TO GROUP THEM FURTHER. IN THE INTEREST OF BEING CONCISE FIRST ON THE ICE TEA WAIT LIST AS AN APARTMENT XIN THERE'S CURRENTLY NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO OR SO PEOPLE ON THAT WAY LESS. AS CURRENTLY DEFINED THAT INCLUDES BOTH PEOPLE WAITING JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A LIMITED. A PASSIVE THE IN STATE HOSPITALS IN JAIL BASED COMPETENCY PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHERE THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT LOCATION FOR THEM IS GOING TO BE. REGARDLESS OF ADDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY THAT PROCESSING TIME THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR AS THEIR DETERMINE WHERE TO TREAT THEM. THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE ON THAT WAIT LIST EVEN IF WE INCREASE CAPACITY. SO WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND WHAT IT THINKS IS AN APPROPRIATE DEFINITION FOR THE WAIT LIST SO THAT I CAN TARGET HOW MANY ADDITIONAL BEDS. TO ADD AND WE SUGGEST IS DEFINING THE WAIT LIST AS CONSISTING OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT THAT PLACE WITHIN SIX WEEKS OF BEING DECLARED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. WHICH IS KIND OF A HIGHER LOW ON AN AVERAGE OF WHAT IT CURRENTLY TAKES THAT APARTMENT TO PROCESS SOMEBODY. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT ASSOCIATED BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION SO THEY GET REPORTING EVERY MONTH ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THAT WAIT LIST ONCE IT HAS THIS CLEAR DEFINITION IN MIND OF WHAT THE WAIT LIST IS. A GOOD THAT THE LEGISLATURE THEM IN A POSITION TO DECIDE HOW MANY BEDS IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THAT WAY LAST. SO THEN ON TO DE ICE TEA CAPACITY PROPOSALS. IT THE LEGISLATURE DEFINED DICEY WAIT LIST AS. NOT BEING PLACE WITHIN SIX WEEKS WE THINK A LARGE PORTION OF THAT WAY THIS COULD BE SERVICE WITH THE. PELE COUNTY PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT OUTLINED AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF THE GEL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS. IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME ADDITIONAL BEDS WILL BE NEEDED AT A MORE INTENSIVE LEVEL THAT THE STATE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES PROVIDE SO WE DO RECOMMEND. THAT IF. THE WEIGHTLESS WERE DEFINED IN THIS MANNER TO ACTIVATE TO OF THE UNITS AT THEM AT METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL. IF THE WAIT LIST CONTINUES TO. CHANGE AS WE GET TO MY REVISION THE REMAINING UNITS THAT ARE REQUESTED. DO YOU SAGE METROPOLITAN COULD BE ACTIVATED. AT A LATER TIME. ONTO THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO A DIRECT APARTMENT AT HEARINGS TO UPDATE ON THE NEGOTIATING PROCESS FOR WHICH COUNTIES ARE GOING TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. AND. THERE PROP PROGRESS IN IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND ON THE LA COUNTY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY GIVEN IT'S A NEW APPROACH WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE FUNDS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND INCLUDE A. AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S EFFECTIVE AND WARRANTS. ONGOING FUNDING. AND THEN ON THE COALINGA EXPANSION. WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO STAFF THESE FACILITY SIMILAR TO HOW IT STAFF IT'S OTHER INDIO FACILITY SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING. THE REQUESTED POSITIONS AND FUNDING COVER WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A STAFFING STUDY TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE STAFFING LEVELS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLETE THAT'S STUDY BY JANUARY TEN TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S IN A POSITION TO ASSESS THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT STAFFING LEVELS AND MAKE ANY NECESSARY. I BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS. AND FINALLY IN REGARDS TO I T. DIVERSION. WE THINK TRYING TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS TODAY BURKE PEOPLE AWAY FROM STATE HOSPITALS. HOUSE A LOT OF STUFF. MERIT AS IT COULD REDUCE FUTURE COSTS AND BE BETTER FOR THE PATIENTS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS. HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS WE CAN FIND THAT IT'S STRUCTURED TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF ICE TEA DIVERSION. THERE ARE THREE REASONS FOR THIS FIRST WE FOUND THAT THE KEY PROGRAM DETAILS ARE UNCLEAR SUCH AS HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE. WE FOUND THE COUNTY INCENTIVES ARE UNCLEAR SUCH AS WHETHER COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED ENOUGH UP TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDING GIVEN THAT FELONY ICE TEA TREATMENT IS FINANCIALLY A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THIRD THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIKELY BE MINIMAL BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP. AND BECOME EFFECTIVE AND MEASURE WHAT'S WORKING HOWEVER THE FUNDING IS ONLY PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS AS OPPOSED TO ON A LONGER TERM BASIS AND THERE ISN'T A MEETING FOR EVALUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY'RE EFFECTIVE. SO IT'S AS AN ALTERNATIVE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH COUNTIES TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. WITH THOSE KEY PROGRAM DETAILS LAID OUT. AND INCLUDING A PLAN TO EVALUATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DETERMINE THOSE PROPOSALS EITHER IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET OR IN FUTURE BUDGETS. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO APPROVE SUCH PROPOSALS WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING FUNDING ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS OVER A FEW YEARS SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN START. AND HOPEFULLY BECOME SUCCESSFUL IN NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL MATCH AND TO THE EXTENT THAT A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE IN A COUNTY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME COULD CONSIDER ON GOING FUNDING. IF IF WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ON OUR HANDS THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH CONTINUE IN AN ON GOING BASIS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHRIS GOT DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO WHILE FINANCING NOTES ARE KNOWLEDGE IS THE ILLEGAL CONCERNS ON THE FUNDING SPECIFIC TO THE HIGHEST HE. PROPOSAL THAT IT'S A LIMITED TERM IN NATURE AND OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS. WHAT WE VIEW THIS AS PROVIDING COUNTIES WITH A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO QUICKLY RAMP UP AND EXPAND ON A LOT OF THEIR? CURRENT MISDEMEANOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY MARRY HAVE MANY OF THESE COUNTIES IN WHICH. THAT. THE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU AS NOTED A HOUSE A LARGE REFERRALS OF THESE AND I IS TEASING TO THE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM SO A LOT OF THEM HAVE. A MENTAL HEALTH COURTS AND I SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHERE THEY COULD QUICKLY RAMP UP. AND SO. WE VIEW THIS AS PROVIDING THE COUNTY SOME FLEXIBILITY TO QUICKLY RAMP UP AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES WERE NEEDED UTILIZING A LOT OF THEIR OTHER FUNDS. THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH MHSAA OR. REALIGNMENT. AND THAT. WE VIEW THAT. THE MODEST AND INVESTMENT FOR COUNTIES FOR TWENTY PERCENT MATCH REALLY INCENTIVIZE THEM TO BEGIN CONTINUING TO USE THEIR OWN MONEY AFTER THE END OF THE THREE YEARS. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. THEN THE ADMINISTRATION. COULD CONTEMPLATE THE ONGOING NATURE OF THEY DIS INVESTMENTS TO THE EXTENT. I MEAN. AT THAT TIME WHERE THE OTHER PARTIES MAYBE. AND THEN SO BUT GOING BACK TO LAST LA THOSE OTHER CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. SPECIFICALLY TO BUILDING UP CAPACITY AS THE HOSPITAL'S I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT A LOT OF THESE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO REQUIRE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. AND A LOT OF. INVESTMENTS MADE. BY THE STATE TO EXPAND THE SERVICES AND A LOT OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ARE REALLY FOR THE STAFFING AND SO. JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT. I. AND TO HAVE A. YEAH. THANK YOU. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE ELEVEN THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. KOBE PRESIDING AGAIN WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND WE JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE DO SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO DO IN ORDER. TO STEM THIS GROWING I S. T. PROBLEM. HOWEVER. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE IST REFERRALS ARE FAR OUTPACING OUR ABILITY TO BUILD CAPACITY. I THINK EVENTUALLY THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ARE GONNA HAVE TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION. THAT A NEW FACILITY IS GONNA HAVE TO BE BILL AT SOME POINT IN TIMEIN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO WAY. TO HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF REFERRALS THAT ARE COMING IN. ADDITIONALLY AS MANY OF YOU HAVE ACTUALLY TOURED SOME OF THE FACILITIES THE MOST RECENT FACILITY IF YOU TAKE OUT GOING TO STAY HOSPITALS WHICH IS WAS DESIGNED FOR RECIPES. WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR AND THAT WAS ATASCADERO STATE HOSPITAL IF YOU'VE BEEN TO NAPA PATTON OR METROPOLITAN SPECIAL INEPT METROPOLITAN. YOU'LL FIND THAT THESE FACILITIES WERE DESIGNED FOR SIMPLY COMMITTED PEOPLE NOT FRIENDS GLEE COMMITTED PEOPLE THE LINES OF SAY ARE DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WHEN. THERE'S POTENTIALLY PREDATORS LYING IN WAIT. TO ATTACK WE'VE HAD MANY VICTIMS AYE THERE ARE STAFF. BE ATTACKED AND INSULTED FROM JUST HAVING POOR SIGHTLINES. ADDITIONALLY. WE WOULD JUST REALLY LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THE SEED PLANTED IN THEIR HEAD. AS TO START THINKING ABOUT THINGS TO DO IN THE FUTURE. IT'S A CAPACITY ISSUE IT'S ALSO SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUE AS WELL AS. AS WELL AS A TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE A BETTER TREATMENT EMPIRE ENVIRONMENT IN A MORE SECURE. MORE COULD USE ANYMORE SETTING THAT'S MORE CONDUCIVE TO TREATMENT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M FAIRLY STATE TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATES ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'M ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF. THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS ASSOCIATION AND URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA A WHERE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO APPLY FUNDING TO THIS LONG STANDING PROBLEM WITH THIS PROBLEM THAT'S REALLY BECOME ACUTE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. AYE BUT WE ARE LIKE ATLEO UNCLEAR ON THE DETAILS. WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE ON THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS AND THE DEPARTMENT FROM FINANCE HAVE BEEN VERY EAGER AND WILLING TO WORK WITH COUNTIES IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK AND WE'RE STILL IN PROCESS OF DOING SO. AND SO I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S APPLICATION OF SOME FUNDING WE THINK THAT WILL HELP BUT HOW WE DESIGNED THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM IS REALLY THE DEVIL'S GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THAT PROCESS ON AGAIN WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY INVOLVED. TO GIVE YOU. MISTER CHAIR KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE EXPANSION OF THE JAIL BASED. TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE. BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY ARE JOB BASED. TREATMENT PROGRAMS BUT WE DO SUPPORT QUITE STRONGLY THE EXPANSION. OF THE LA PROGRAM IN THE. SUCCESS THAT THEY'VE HAD IN WORKING WITH MISDEMEANORS. AND DIVERSION DOWN THERE. WERE ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED TO PUT IN THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR. EXPANSION AND FURTHER DIVERSION PROGRAMS. TO HOPEFULLY DO THE UPSTREAM. THE DAMMING OF OTHER FOLKS COMING INTO OF THE STATE HOSPITALS HOWEVER WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT. THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY OR PERIOD OVER THREE YEARS TIME LIMITED DOLLARS. THAT REALLY THE FOCUS. SHOULD BE MORE ON FELONIES NOW AND DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING THAT IT TAKES A COMMUNITY BASED FELONY. PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN THE MISDEMEANOR PROGRAMS AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE QUITE SUCCESSFUL AND WE OUGHT OF LEVERAGE THE. IMAGES SAY DOLLARS TO. CONTINUE THOSE. MISDEMEANOR PROGRAMS BUT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR LEARNING ON THE. FELONY BASED. PROGRAMS AND AND ACTUALLY REDUCING A BED SPACE IN THE STATE HOSPITALS AS LONG AS. IT IS PROVIDED THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS STRONG SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND OF COURSE VERY. STRONG EVALUATION COMPONENT AND OF THE PERIOD THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CAIRMAN RESIGNED ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THE IN A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INVEST. A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR THE HIGHEST HE POPULATIONS REGRETTABLY RIVERSIDE COUNTY FINDS ITSELF. AT DATA US LOT NUMBER FIFTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL I ALLOCATION OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. OF FUNDING. BUT SO UNFORTUNATELY AS A RESULT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP THE KIND OF ROBUST SERVICE SYSTEM OF THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE THE VIEW OF THE THE ICY PROPOSAL IS AN OPPORTUNITY. UP TO BEGIN INVESTING AND DIVERTING AND TREATING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WE UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS I NEED SOME ADDITIONAL WORK AND ATTENTION I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE THANK YOU. HUMAN. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. COUPLE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I DID I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT VISITED A WHEN THE STATE HOSPITALS AND. BUT MY CONCERN IS I YOU KNOW I AGREE ON THE MANY THE PROBLEM THAT I SAW THOUGH IS. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOLKS TO TO. COMMON WORK AT THESE FACILITIES YOU FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WENT IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS I FELT. AND I WAS WITH MY WHOLE ENTIRE STAFF AND WITH SECURITY AND IT WAS JUST REALLY. DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TO BE. THERE AND SEE THE ARM THE WORKERS A RESULT LACK OF. OF. SUPPORT. I SAW THE LITTLE. THE DISTRESS OF BUTTONS WHICH ARE GREAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. PEOPLE WORKING AT THE HOSPITALS WE CAN INVEST ALL THE MONEY THAT. YOU WE ONE BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS AND IF YOU CAN ANSWER. HOW MANY POSITIONS ARE YOU CURRENTLY HAVE AND HOW MANY ARE VACANT? THAT'S THE DOUBLE THE ONE QUESTION THE OTHER QUESTION IS. I ALSO SIT ON. HUMAN SERVICES AND. AGING AND LONG TERM CARE AND THE NUMBER ONE. THE NUMBER ONE. I GUESS ISSUE FOR THOSE. PROGRAMS IS THE LACK OF NURSES AS WELL IF THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME HIRING THESE FOLKS AND THERE YOU KNOW BY ALL ACCOUNTS A SAFER. ENVIRONMENT TO WORK IN HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO EMPLOY A ALL OF THESE. OF FOLKS WERE TRAIN THEM AND BE IN A POSITION. WHERE IT'S HIGHER RISK IF LIKE I SAID IF WE'RE HAVING AN ISSUE WITH A LOWER RISK? YOU KNOW BUT SENIORS AND THOSE TYPES OF A POSITION HOW IN THE WORLD THAT WE'RE GOING TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND. IF YOU CAN FIND THAT NUMBER I REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE WE CAN OUT ALL OF THE POSITIONS THAT WE WANT BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOLKS TO FILL THEM. HOW DO WE EXPECT TO MOVE FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW MANY BEDS WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE WITH WHAT PEOPLE WHAT WHAT POPULATION OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVICES FOLKS? IN IN IN ON THIS CAPACITY SO THAT'S KIND OF A LONG WINDED QUESTION BUT THE THE POINT TO IT IS THAT. WE CAN INVEST ALL OF THIS MONEY BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE. FOLKS. THAT ARE GOING TO FEEL SECURE BECAUSE OF THE RATIOS THEN HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FILL THE POSITIONS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. YET THERE ARE ALL OF THESE INCREASES SUPPOSED TO. TO STOP THE WAIT LIST. REDUCE SAID OR IS IT JUST OF OUR BEING ARE WE. CHASING OUR TAIL AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AS THE WAIT LIST INCREASE SAYS ARE WE JUST SERVICE SINGLES. IF YOU FOLKS AND THEN WE HAVE. I IN INCREASE IN AND THAT POPULATION WHICH SOUNDS LIKE IT'S IS. IS WHAT WORD WE ARE FACING HERE SO LIKE I SAID I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND ALL OF THAT STATISTICS BY. I FOUND THAT ARE ARE A. OR. INFORMATION UP HERE. IS GREAT BUT SPREADSHEETS ARE FANTASTIC BUT IMPLEMENTING. THE SPREADSHEETS AND VERY DIFFERENT ON THE GROUND THAN IT IS HERE IN ARGUES AN EXAMPLE. AS MY TEACHING CAREER WAS A TEACHER AND HAD. X. AMONG THE STUDENTS AND I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE OVER YOU KNOW THIRTY FOUR I THINK AND I HAVE THEM IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE CENTER REPORTS THAT VERY SIMPLE. THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO POINT HAVE OF FIVE KIDS IN THIS ROOM AND THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE KIDS IN THAT ROOM. AND MY RESPONSE WAS WHICH COULD DO YOU WANT ME TO. CUT UP BECAUSE ON THE SPREAD SHEET IT LOOKS FANTASTIC BUT IMPLEMENTING THOSE IS VERY DIFFICULT SO AGAIN LONG WINDED BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME CONVERSATION OR SOME DISCUSSION AS TO HOW WE EXPECT TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS THAT WERE. YOU KNOW. GOING TO GIVE YOU ALL THIS MONEY FOR. CERTAINLY SO I'LL START WITH THE BIG CANCERS WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE WAIT LIST SO. IT IN KIND OF IN THE CONTEXT OF IT THERE WAS AND NOT ONLY THE VACANCIES BUT THE CONCERN FOR SAFETY AND SO I WANT TO TAKE I JUST TALK ABOUT AND. AS SAFETY FIRST AND THEN AND THEN THE POSITION SO AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE AND SAFETY IS. FOR OUR STAFF AND OUR PATIENTS BOTH IS ONE OF OUR MEMORY IS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND SO. A LOT OF. OUR EFFORTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT PRIORITY AND ONE OF THE PROPOSALS TODAY IS IS. THE ENHANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM IS A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND I AM REALLY AND LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING AND CATEGORIES SAYING AND THEN AND. AND DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR. THAT THE TYPES OF AGGRESSION THAT WE SEE WITH OUR FACILITIES AS WELL AS THE. AND ENHANCING OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU DID HEAR FROM OUR PARTNER I'D AND NOT CAPTIVES AS WELL AS YOUR OWN EXPERIENCING AND IT THE FACILITIES WERE NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNED FOR. AND THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE AND SO IT'S A REAL IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE EVERY DAY SO YOU KNOW THROUGH OUR PERSONAL DURESS ALARM SYSTEMS THAT YOU YOU DID GET TO SEE. DOES HAVE AND BROUGHT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESPONSE TO SITUATIONS WHEN THEY DO OCCUR IN THE FACILITIES AND ND WE HAVE SEEN IS. SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION AND AND PATIENT ON. AND PATIENT IMPATIENCE STAFF VIOLENCE OVER THE LAST AND THE OVER THE YEARS AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS. AND WITH RESPECT TO VACANCY IS I'M GONNA LOOK TO SEE IF I CAN POP NUMBER REALLY QUICK BUT AND HAVE IT WITH ME DATA YET SO. MY. I HAVE WITH ME. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BURY IT WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE THE CLASSIFICATION AND AND YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO. THAT BED PROPOSAL AT METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THERE THAT WE HAVE LOWER VACANCY RATES BECAUSE IT'S A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA THAT WERE ABLE TO. TO STAFF IN. BUT LOOKING AT. THE TOP AM OUR TOP TEN VACANCIES YOU KNOW WE RUN ANYWHERE FROM. LIKE A SEVEN PERCENT STATEWIDE AND SITE TAX TO OUR PSYCHIATRIST RATES. ARE MUCH GREATER I'M STATEWIDE AND RUNNING AT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT SO AND THE WE DO HAVE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO. FILLING POSITIONS AND WE DO ADDRESS THAT IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. AND WE DO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES WHERE I'M WHERE UNABLE TO. HIGHER LIKE IN ATASCADERO AND AND COALINGA AND SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE TO BRING AND CONTRACTED TO PSYCHIATRISTS AND AND AND OTHER I'M CLASSIFICATIONS IN ORDER TO HELP US MEET THAT THEY NEED. AND WE DO A LOT OF RECRUITMENT AND WE PARTNER WITH. YOU KNOW THE. EDUCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY FOR THE NURSING I'M POSITIONS AND WE HAVE DIRECT PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE JUNIOR COLLEGES IN THE. AND THE IT AND UNIVERSITIES. THAT I'M. A TRAIN THOSE INDIVIDUALS SO THAT WE CAN NINE AND HAVE THAT DIRECT PIPELINE YOU ACTUALLY OFFER A PSYCHIATRIC. TECHNICIAN TRAINING PROGRAM RIGHT ON THE CAMPUS I HAD TO. AT ATASCADERO SO WE WORK REALLY HARD TO HAVE PRIORITIZE THE FILLING OF OUR POSITIONS. AND. AND TO. ENSURE THAT WE. WE CAN FILL THE POSITIONS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALWAYS REGARDLESS OF THE POSITION VACANCIES HAVE TO MEET THE STAFFING MINIMUMS FOR LICENSING AND WE DO MEET THE OF THE STAFFING MATT I'M REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR LICENSING SO. WE DON'T HAVE THE. THE ABILITY TO TO DROP DOWN BELOW THOSE. WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIT LIST. AND WE. IT. THAT'S HARD AND THAT'S HARD TO PROJECT. IT WHETHER ALL OF THIS CAPACITY AND WILL DEFINITELY. ELIMINATE THE IT'S A PROBLEM I KNOW IT IS I THINK THIS YEAR IT'S. IMPORTANT HERE IN THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DEMAND SIDE VERSES JUST CAPACITY SO CHANGING THE. THEDIRECTION THAT AN INDIVIDUAL AND SORT OF CYCLING THROUGH THE STATE HOSPITAL IN AND AND. BEING IN AND BEING IDENTIFIED AS ENCOMPASSING ON TRIAL AND ENDING UP WITH A CRIMINAL. IT WITH CONVICTION OR A YOU KNOW A RECORD OF SOME SORT CYCLING BACK THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE ARE AND. PUTTING THE AND THE RESOURCES INTO THE DEMAND SIDE SO PROVIDING THE COUNTIES THE NEED THE ASSISTANCE TO DATE NO DEVELOP THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY CONNECT THESE INDIVIDUALS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. AND PROVIDE IN THE MEANINGFUL SERVICES TO KEEP THEM FROM DOING THAT CYCLING THROUGH AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE STATE HOSPITAL SO I THINK WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT DIET AND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT GREAT IMPACT THAT CAN HAVE IT'S HARD TO TELL BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE WE HAVE IT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE REFERRAL SO THEY DO CONTINUE TO GO UP LIKE THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. WHICH WE HOPE THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO SEND THEM OFF ON THAT ON THE FRONT END. IS YOU KNOW WE WE ANTICIPATE BASED ON THE CURRENT REFER ALL A PATTERN THAT WE WE SHOULD SEE OF SUBSTANTIAL DROP OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. I HAVE WITH ME AS WE BACK TO BEAT THIS CAPACITY IN THE WEIGHTLESS. THEN TO STOP. I VISITED A. CRUMBLING. INFRASTRUCTURE AYE WHAT FROM WHAT I SAW AND. AT SOME POINT ARE WE GOING TO AND I KNOW IT'S A COSTLY ENDEAVOR AND I BUT I DO HAVE TO ASK A REBIRTH HAVING ANY PLANS ON. ON. YOU DON'T PUT IN SOME MONEY INTO THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE PLACES AND THE ONE THAT I VISITED. THAT REALLY WAS NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE TYPE OF WORK THAT THAT. WERE DOING AND SO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IN MY MIND AND I'M NOT AN EXPERT BY ANY MEANS BUT IN MY MIND THAT THINGS TO BE. YOU KNOW COMPLETELY. TOWARD TORN DOWN AND AND REBUILT I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY THING THE ONLY WAY I THINK. BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN. IT WASN'T EVEN EASY TO ACCESS. AND THE UNITED. DANGEROUS SITUATION IF YOU CAN ACCESS SAID THAT ALSO MEANS YOU CAN GET OUT AND SO SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTS BECAUSE I SEE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEING CRITICAL TO. TO THE ABILITY OF OF YOU KNOW FOR THESE WORKERS TO DO THEIR JOB IT WAS AND I WAS JUST REALLY KEEPING I DO HAVE TO. TO TO SAY IT I AM I'M NOT USED TO THAT BUT THE FACILITY I VISITED THE. NURSES STATION WAS IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN. THE THE INMATES WERE SO THEY'VE GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO ALSO ALL CIRCLING THE NURSES STATION AND JUST ME. OUTSIDE LIKE WHILE IT JUST FELT LIKE A SHARK CIRCLING AND IT I'D I HONESTLY WAS WAS VERY DISTURBED BY THAT. AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS. LOOKING AT THE WORKERS IS HOW DO THEY COME IN EVERY DAY AND NOT ONLY AS A WORKER BUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS IT I FELT LIKE IT WAS A POLICE OFFICER. YOU KNOW WHEN THE THE POLICE OFFICER. GOES OUT TO WORK IN THE FAMILY DOES ENOUGH THEY'RE COMING BACK OR NOT AND I AND THAT'S REALLY HOW I FELT SO I THINK WE NEED TO. REALLY BE MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE SET THESE TREATMENT PROGRAMS UP AND AND I CAN GO ON ABOUT THEY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FENDED OFF ON THE FRONT AND I IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW ENDS IN SCHOOL I CAN. I JOIN TORRENTIAL WITH KIDS AND ANTIETAM SO THAT THEY DON'T GO BACK HOW DO YOU PREVENT AND THE BATTLE I LEAVE FOR ANOTHER CONVERSATION AND MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME BY SENDING ME BE YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS. SO THAT I CAN READ ABOUT IT I WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME HERE TO DO IT BUT THAT'S ALSO CONCERNED HOW IS IT THAT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN PREDICT WHO'S GOING TO BE. INCOMPETENCE HISSED AS TO STAND TRIAL AND AND BE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT I THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT IN MY MY MIND HOW WE CAN PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE I SAID WITH KIDS YOU CAN PREVENTED BY EDUCATING THEM A LITTLE MORE BUT HOW DO YOU HOW CAN YOU PREDICT WHO'S GOING TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN. LOOK AT THAT SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND PERHAPS SEVENTY SOME INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I KNOW. IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK BUT I REALLY DO. I SUPPORT THE PROGRAM ORDERED THAT THE REQUESTS. BUT WITH A TON OF QUESTIONS ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY. BE IMPLEMENTED. LET HIM MAKE A WEIRD SEGUE IF I CAN PUT IN MEDICINE. YOU EITHER TREATED THE SYMPTOMS ARE TREATED THE DISEASE PROCESS. AND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS A SYMPTOM. IT'S NOT THE DISEASE PROCESS THAT WORD TREATING. AND SO THEN I HAVE TO ASK WHY DID WE END UP IN THIS PLACE AND SO. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE INCREASED CAPACITY WE'VE INCREASED TURNOVER. BUT IT'S THE INCREASED REFERRAL BASE AND SO I'M. WONDERING IF THERE SOMETHING UPSTREAM WERE NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH TO HELP TO TREAT. PEOPLE WHO. BEFORE THEY GET TO THIS POINT SO MY QUESTION IS REALLY GOING TO STAND AROUND. WHAT WERE WEREN'T THESE? PATIENTS ACCESSING SERVICES PRIOR TO BECOMING AN ICED TEA. IS THERE SOME CORRELATION TO. RECENT MENTAL HEALTH VISITS DO WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS OF THEM BEING DECLARED IN THE HIGHEST T.. TO HAVE IMPACT AND WHY I BRING THAT UP IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND SEE IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE AN IMPACT. YEAH AND I'M I'M JUST BEEN JOINED BY A DOCTOR WORK WITH BARBERTON OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND I'M I'M GOING TO TURN OVER TO JUST SECONDS HAD TO TALK ABOUT THE. THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO. THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT AND TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I AM. DID WANTED TO KIND OF TO A TALK ABOUT. THE. THAT JUST TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THERE'S A. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE UNDER STATUTE OR REQUIRED TO DO IN PROVIDE TREATMENT VERSES THE AND TREATMENT THAT'S RECEIVED IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHEN YOU SAY. TREATING THE SYMPTOMS YOU ARE OUR FOCUS IS WHEN WHEN THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL AND REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. WE ARE OUR GOAL IS IDENTIFYING THE BARRIER TO COMPETENCY. CONTINUOUS ESTIMATE THAT BARRIER IS PROVIDING THE TREATMENT AND WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THAT BARRIER HAS BEEN RESOLVED. WE IDENTIFY THEM AS BEING OF RESTORED AND SEND THEM ON TO BACK TO COURT TO GO THROUGH THEIR DUE PROCESS IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN A COMPREHENSIVE FULL SCALE. YOU AND IT TREATMENT SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT YOU KNOW AND TREATING THE SYMPTOMS VERSUS TREATING. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE BEST PLACE FOR THEM TO GET TREATMENT IS TO BACK IT UP AND WHICH IS WHY THIS PROPOSAL IS COMING FOR YOU TODAY. THE BUT I WOULD WE HAVE DONE A QUITE A BIT OF DATA ANALYSIS AND SO I TALKED. TURN IT OVER TO DOCTOR WERE BURNED TO TALK ABOUT. THANK YOU MY NAME'S KATE WERE WRITTEN ON THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT STATE HOSPITALS IN MY FRIENDS EXPECT HIGH INTEREST AND WE'VE BEEN STUDYING ARE HIGHEST TEETH POPULATION FOR A LONG TIME SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN CONJUNCTION. WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY IN THE LAW. SO WE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY CODING EVERY SINGLE ICED TEA ADMISSIONS SINCE THAT TIME AND NAPA STATE HOSPITAL OVER FOUR THOUSAND EMISSIONS. OF THUS FAR AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LONGITUDINAL DATA DESCRIPTIVE DATA ON THESE PATIENTS AND. THE SHORT ANSWER IS THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN THEIR DIAGNOSTIC PROFILE IN THE RATE OF MALINGERING IN THE RED COGNITIVE DISORDERS IN THE RATE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN. MARKET INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OR THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS COMING AND WHO'VE HAD. A FIFTEEN OR MORE PRIOR ARRESTS. THAT NUMBER'S GONE FROM AROUND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION TO ABOUT FORTY FIVE PERCENT. SO AS WE DIG DOWN AND LOOK AT THEIR ARREST REPORTS AND THEIR RAPSHEETS WHAT WE'RE SEEING. A QUALITATIVELY AS A PATTERN OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAVING THE. UNCONTROLLED PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS CORPS IN CRISIS WHO ARE NOT HOW MOST WHO ARE GETTING INTO. ARREST SITUATIONS THAT. ARE RELATED TO THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS POVERTY OR THEIR UNCONTROLLED PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS. AND THEY'RE SORT OF RACKING UP MORE OFFENSES MISDEMEANORS AND THEN THEY'RE FINALLY GETTING THAT FELONY CHARGE AND SOMETIMES THOSE CHARGES. ARE AND. I CHARGED AS FELONIES ONCE THE POLICE OFFICER GETS INVOLVED IN THE PATIENT IS PARANOID IT BECOMES COMBATIVE. SO WITH SO QUANTITATIVELY WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT INCREASE AND PRIOR ARRESTS QUALITATIVELY WE CAN TALK ABOUT. OTHER CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THOSE ARRESTS. AND. LOOKING AT THAT SAMPLE WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE COATING PROCESS STATEWIDE TO SEE IF THIS WE GOT THE SAME RESULTS DID. IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT SAMPLE WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR. WE ADDED IN QUESTIONS ABOUT HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE ARREST REPORTS. AND WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE. OF. IC PATIENTS THAT WE ADMITTED. WARNING AND SHELTERED HOMELESS STATUS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ARREST SO. IF THEY WERE STAYING IN A SHELTER ON CITIES COUCH. IN SOMEBODY'S YARD IN THE TEN WE DO NOT COUNT THAT AS ON SHELTER TO THESE ARE THE FOLKS LIVING ON THE STREET. ON JUST ABOUT HALF THE SAMPLE. WE ALSO DID A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH D. H. CS. OF WHERE WE GOT MEDI CAL UTILIZATION DATA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT TO YOUR POINTS ARE THESE PEOPLE ACCESSING SERVICES. AND IN THAT. SAMPLE. FOUR HUNDRED THAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE KIND OF GAVE THE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION D. H. THIS AND THEY GAVE BACK THE UTILIZATION DATA. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. ABOUT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT DID NOT ACCESS TO MEDICAL REIMBURSABLE MEN HEALTH SERVICES IN THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. A SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS KIND OF THIS COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE UNCONTROLLED SOMETIMES OF PSYCHOSIS WHO ARE IN AN UNSHIELDED HOMELESS STATUS WHO ARE NOT. UTILIZING UMOJA SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY AND WHO ARE GETTING INTO MORE AND MORE AND MORE TROUBLE WITH THE LAW ON A GRADUAL BASIS OVERTIME. AND WE DID DO A NATIONAL STUDY LAST YEAR. WHERE WE SENT OUT THE SORT OF SURVEY TO? FIFTY ONE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN ALL FIFTY STATES. AND WE GOT A RESPONSE RATE OF A FIFTY AND FIFTY ONE I JURISDICTIONS RESPONDING. I AM REALLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF STATES RESPONDING SAID THAT THEY'RE SEEING THESE INCREASES. SIXTY SOME PERCENT SAID THEY HAVE A WAIT LIST AND FORTY ONE PERCENT ARE CURRENTLY FACING LITIGATION AS A RESULT OF THAT WE LIST IN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE LITIGATION. IS THE HONESTY IS SUIT AND FEDERAL COURT IN THE FEDERAL COURT PUT SAY. ON MANDATORY MINIMUM TIMELINE FOR ADMITTING THIS PATIENTS I SAW YOUR SENSUALLY FORCIBLY OVERCROWDING YOUR HOSPITALS ON YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ADMITTING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT SPACES. AND OFFICE SPACES IN RESPONSE TO A FEDERAL. TIMELINE MANDATES US SO WE'RE SEEING THIS. SOMEWHAT BIZARRE SITUATION OF OF. PATIENTS. BUT. ESSENTIALLY SUING TO BECOME INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE HOSPITALS IN RESPONSE ARE KIND OF BREAKING DOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HANDLE THE ADMISSION RATE SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO. FIND A WAY TO CUT OFF THE DEMANDS AND. I AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRIMARY PROBLEM BECAUSE AS MS CLINTON AND NOTED. COMMENTS HE RESTORATION IN NO RIGHT WAY RESEMBLES COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND WE'RE REMOVING THE VERY TO CONFIDENCE AND SEND THEM BACK INTO THE SAME MASS. EITHER THEY WERE IN BEFORE. HE SHARED A TON OF REALLY GET INFORMATION. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT CANNOT POPS IN MY HEAD IS. WHEN DID YOU START GATHERING THE WHAT DAY. FOR HONOR DATA COLLECTION DID YOU BEGAN. AND THAT NAPSTER DO WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SOME I'M JUST AS THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS OUT THERE IN REGARDS TO PROPS FORTY. WITH PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT. WITH.% DEGRADING WHAT WAS ONCE FELONY TO A MISDEMEANOR IN IN PEOPLE. WHO ARE IN A ALTERED MENTAL STATUS NOT QUITE GETTING? IT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SO. I'M CURIOUS TO NUMBERS WITH CORRELATIONS ON ON THOSE NOW POPULATIONS. TO SEE IF ANY OF THAT GOES INTO OR MENTAL HEALTH FOLKS. BECAUSE OF OF TALKED TO A LOT OF FOLKS LA LOCAL. IN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DEAL WITH THESE POPULATIONS AND. YOU KNOW IS IT'S SAD THAT. THERE IS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME THIS KIND OF. LOG GO ALL DO SOMETHING NOT GET ARRESTED. AND NOW I KNOW I'M SOMEWHERE SAFE BECAUSE I'M IN JAIL. MENTALITY. AND THEN THOSE STAY IN IN THE GET RELEASED AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT IN SOCIETY BECAUSE IF CONTINUE TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS OF A GOOD TO ANOTHER CRIME TO GO BACK IN. AND SO I'M REALLY CURIOUS ON ANY DATA. WITHIN THAT POPULATION BECAUSE IT IT'S REALLY SAD AND IT'S TRAGIC BUT IT'S HAPPENING. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THESE FOLKS NOW. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF DATA A LOT IN NUMBERS. HEY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT THINGS. LIKE THE CHAIR SAID. YOU KNOW THE PIECE OF STRING THINGS WHAT IT WHAT ARE THESE OTHER CAUSES OF ME AND THINK YOU WE HEAR ALL THE TIME YOU KNOW MORE MONEY ON EDUCATION. GEL. BUT WHAT ARE WE REALLY LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WE SAID THROUGH HEARINGS DOWN. LAST WEEK. TYROD ACES SCORES IN IN YOUTH AND POVERTY IN AND HOW THESE THINGS ARE AFFECTING THEIR BRAINS. MIA SO WHERE DOES IT REALLY START TO GET SOMEBODY TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T STAND TRIAL. ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT THAT. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN THE RIGHT SPOTS. IT'S TRAGIC THAT WE HAVE A POPULATION OUT THERE NOW. THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT. HOW TO DECREASE IT INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY FIGHTING AT THE WRONG WAY AS IT INCREASES? YOU'VE VERY PHONY ó ABSOLUTELY AGREE MORE AND I THINK. I THINK THIS BUDGET REFLECTS OUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF YOUR POINT WITCHES WE CAN'T JUST KEEP BUILDING MORE HOSPITAL BEDS TO. RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES THAT NEED ADDRESSING TO STOP THE CYCLE. WILK WHO. I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS INVESTED A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESOURCES INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND THAT THE COUNTIES DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE. OUT PATIENT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AND. I GUESS THAT REALLY IS THE QUESTION THE PLO HAS PUT IN FRONT OF US IN IS ASKING POLICIES. IS THIS DIVERSION PACKAGING ANYWAY. SUPERIOR TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING THAT. IS THIS MEANT TO SUPPLANT IT TO WORK TO SUPPLEMENT. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND I ASK. PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF HOW MUCH RESERVES THEY HAVE. AND WONDERING WITH WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IF WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED HAVING SPENT SOME OF THOSE RESERVES AND HELPING TO GET UPSTREAM OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE. BEFORE US NOW. I HAVE CONCERNS WHEN I. SEE THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE TRAJECTORY THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AS A STATE. THAT IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE LED A SYMPTOM FASTER FOR AWHILE. AND HAVE GONE UNTREATED THE TRUE. DISEASE PROCESS WHICH IS. THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT OUR STATE FACES. AND. THEME UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M REALLY TRYING TO DO AGAIN IS SPECIFICS OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAM IF I'M. AND I'D LIKE TO. ASK IF I CAN. THE LA WHAT MADE A SUGGESTION ABOUT SIX WEEKS TO THEN BE DEFINED AS BEING ONTO A WAIT LIST. IS THAT A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME. IS. IS THE WEEKS A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME. ETCETERA. AND THEN ALMOST TRYING LEAD YOU DOWN THE PATH. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE FIFTEEN PREVIOUS ARRESTS. BEFORE SOMEONE GETS DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. THAT WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO HELP TO DIVERT AND A FEW. WAIT WAIT WAIT WITHOUT I THINK SOME OF THE SAUCE GETS INTO THE DIAGNOSES. ON ON THE WHITE THE MENTAL ILLNESS IS AN AND I HATE TO USE THE TERM NOT WIRED RIGHT. BUT SOME FOLKS. AND CERTAIN ILLNESSES OR JUST AN AUTOMATIC. I MEAN A I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE IT'S TRAGIC BUT WHEN I'M IN THERE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS. THEY COULD BE WRONG WITH SOMEBODY WHERE THERE IS NO HOPE FOR THEM THE AND WE HAVE TO PUT THEM IN A SITUATION THAT'S BEST SUITED TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND KEEP SOCIETY SAFE IS WHILE. SO WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THERE'S. THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF HELP THAT CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO GET THAT'S GONNA MAKE THEM READY TO STAND TRIAL. IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND IT'S A REALITY ASSIGNS. AND IN IT IT'S TRAGIC AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S SOME PEOPLE INCOMES ADDICTIONS AND DRUGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT THAT WE CAN HELP WITH THERE'S OTHER MENTAL STUFF WHERE IF THEY'RE ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS BUT. THE SAMETIME THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT JUST FLAT ON OUR LARA WIRED RIGHT AND THERE'S NO MATTER HELP THIS GOING TO HELP THEM. BE READY TO STAND TRIAL WOULD BE READY FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO BE READY. TO BE SAFELY LET OUT IN SOCIETY BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT THERE. SO A AS YOU DO THAT PLEASE COMPARE AND CONTRAST DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS. THAT WEEK THAT IT WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW SO I I KNOW YOU GOT THE NUMBERS. BUT BUT PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING. DAHLE COMPREHEND ALL OF THAT WITHOUT IT BEING SPELLED OUT ON A REALLY PRETTY SPREADSHEET UNFORTUNATELY. SORRY I ASKED ABOUT THE SIX WEEKS THOUGH AND WANTED TO SEE HOW WE COULD HELP TO GET UP ST. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX WEEKS I MEAN COMPRESSION WHAT OF THE LA DOES PROPOSAL IS AN AND UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE GOAL IS A THINK AND WE WOULD HAVE A CONCERN WITH AND SIX WEEKS? GIVEN THAT I. AND THEIR YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS AT PLAY WITH RESPECT TO AND. AS THE THE WAY LESS STAND AND FIRST OF ALL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME IN A BEFORE SOMEBODY IS ADMITTED TO A STATE HOSPITAL AND SO. AND ADD ANDERSON ENDING THAT RIGHT NOW THAT ISN'T THE RATE LIMITING STEP SO THINGS MAY BE TAKING LONGER FOR US TO PROCESS PAPERWORK BECAUSE. WE DON'T NEED TO PROCESS IT TODAY VERSES EIGHT IF WE HAD SORT OF WAIT TIMES THAT DOT PROCESS WOULD GET I'M CONDONES. WRITTEN FIFTY TWO DAYS I THINK THAT'S HOW MANY DAYS HE SAID THE AVERAGE. INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS ON THE WAITING LIST IS THAT ACCEPTABLE OR WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE. AMOUNT OF TIME AND. AND. AND THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE WITH THE COURTS RIGHT NOW. SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE WE ARE ARE CHALLENGED IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY. A ARE VERY CLEAR. GUIDANCE FROM ON THIS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE WE HAVE BEEN PRIOR UNDER PRIOR COURT DIRECTION TO ADMIT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. WHO NATIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SEEN FEDERAL COURT CASES RESULT IN INDIVIDUAL AND HOSPITALS BEING BEING REQUIRED TO ADMIT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS? AND SO. AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY. BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS ON ORDERS TO SHOW CAUSE. WERE IN COURTS DEAL ONLY. AND WHEN WE NEED BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ADMITTING INDIVIDUALS TIMELY AND WE'VE BEEN UNDER COURT ORDERS FROM ANYWHERE FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIXTY DAYS OURSELVES SO. I THINK CITING AS A SIX WEEK TIME FRAME DOESN'T NECESSARILY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT KIND A DYNAMIC THAT WERE IN WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE CORE I'M BUT WE'D BE HAPPY THAT YOU KNOW CONTINUE TIME. DIALOGUE AND AND SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT DOES MAKE SENSE AND. I WANT TO GET THE LA DOES. REASONING BEHIND BY WE HAD SIX WEEKS. WRONG BUT DO WANT TO FOCUS THE CONVERSATION FOR THE REMAINDER OF TODAY IF I CAN ON THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. THAT'S BEFORE US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE AS MUCH INPUT INTO IT AS WE CAN. IT. DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS. WITHOUT JUST JUMPING TO IT. THAT MANY OF THE MEMBER PROPOSALS WE HEARD HAD. A LOT MORE DETAILS THAN WHAT I'M SEEING IN FRONT OF ME WITH THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND FEEL THAT THERE'S MORE DETAILS I NEED TO BE ADDED TO IT. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU WAS WANTING FLEXIBILITY? AND. WANTS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILT IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT TO. TO HAVE EARNED THAT FLEXIBILITY IN SOME TRYING TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT THE REASONING WAS BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL AS IT PLAYED OUT TODAY? THANK YOU MISTER SHARIA OF WITH WITH RESPECT TO THIS SIX WEEK TIME PERIOD WE AGREE THAT THERE THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO DEFINE THE WILL BE THE WEIGHTLESS IN A WAY THAT REALLY SEPARATES THE PROBLEM OF. PROCESSING PEOPLE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT LOCATION WITH. OUR OUR OTHER PROBLEMS OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH CAPACITY. AND SO TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THAT WAY LESS BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE CAPACITY AND WHAT. CHANGES TO CAPACITY DO WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET INTO TREATMENT AT THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSING ALTERNATIVES TO THE SIX WEEK TIME PERIOD WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO THE WORK THEY NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THERE. IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM BECAUSE. WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE RUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE WRONG PROGRAM. AND SOURCES IF IT'S SIX WEEKS OR SIXTY DAYS IF THE COURT CAME IN AND SAID THERE'S ANOTHER STANDARD. OUR GOAL IS JUST TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS. THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE ON THAT PROBLEM RATHER THAN TRY TO. ON TACKLE WEIGHTLESS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE BECAUSE WILL NEED SOME PROCESSING. EARLIER WE HAD HEARD FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS OF A DIVERSION PROGRAM. RELATING TO MISDEMEANORS. WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM. AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE AS A STATE ARE LOOKING OUT CONSIDERING THIS CURRENT TEMPERATURE. ON OCCASION ACTUALLY VISITED THAT PROGRAM DO ON A TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT. YEAH AND I THINK MAYBE I CAN LIVE TO SINCE HERE EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY. I'M AND AND ALSO OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT WIRE CITY HOSPITALS ADMINISTERING COUNTY FUNDS FOR DIVERSION LA ALL QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE GOT ALL GREAT QUESTIONS AND I THINK. AND REALLY THE ANSWER IS WE KNOW THE PATIENT POPULATION WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE PATIENT POPULATION. WE UNDERSTAND WHO THESE FOLKS ARE AND WHERE UNDERSTANDING MORE AND MORE EVERYDAY ABOUT THE COURSE THAT THERE. I TRAVERSING TO COME TO US WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO SHUT OUR DOORS AND CLOSE DOWN DUE TO LACK OF BUSINESS. AND TO SEE ALL THESE FOLKS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT COUNTIES HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENCE. A DIVERSION PRACTICES IN PLACE. THE CONCEPT OF JAIL DIVERSION IS A FAIRLY WELL STUDIED WELL ARTICULATED. CONSTRUCT. WHERE YOU CAN HAVE DIVERSION AT ANY NUMBER OF POINTS WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? AYE THERE HAVE BEEN. NATIONAL STEPPING UP INITIATIVES THE COUNCIL ON STATE GOVERNMENTS AND CERTAIN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE QUOTE UNQUOTE STEPPED UP TO TRY TO. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF A MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS WHO ARE INCARCERATED. SO WE DO SEE AND WE'VE BEEN ON A LITTLE. NUMBER FIELD TRIPS LOOKING A COUNTIES HAVE IN PLACE WE DO SEE COLLABORATIVE COURTS WE DO SEE FOR EXAMPLE THE MISDEMEANOR ICED TEA PROGRAM IN IN LOS ANGELES WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. WE SEE. YOU KNOW. GOTTA COUNTIES THAT ARE STARTING OUT THE CLEVER OF COURT MODEL BUT DON'T HAVE THE PLACE TO DIVERT TO SAID THERE'S. VARIOUS. DIVERSION EFFORTS BASED ON VARIOUS COUNTY NEEDS IN VARIOUS COUNTY RESOURCES THAT ARE SORT OF BEING STOOD UP. AYE AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S IN THEIR LANGUAGE IS TO ALLOW. US TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS AND GET THE COUNTIES TO THE PLACE. WHERE THEY CAN START DIVERTING MORE OF THE FOLKS THAT WE UNDERSTAND USING THESE MECHANISMS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING DEVELOPED IF THAT MAKES SENSE SO THAT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE POPULATION? CAN WE. ROOT BEER OR RETOOL THE MECHANISMS THEY HAVE A PLACE TO TARGET THE POPULATION THAT WE UNDERSTAND SO WELL AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT NECESSARILY THERE HAS TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY. I AND AND WE'RE HOPING THAT. THE COLLABORATION I AS WELL AS ASKING FOR OUTCOMES HAVE YOU REDUCED THE NUMBER OF FELONY ICED TEA ADMISSION THAT HAVE YOU REDUCE THE RATE OF REFERRAL OF FUNNY ICE TEA EMISSIONS. HAVE YOU READ IT REDUCED RECIDIVISM HAVE YOU HAD SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM COMPLETION HAVE YOU HAD SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF COMPLETED. UP PROGRAM HAVE FOLKS INTO LONG TERM COMMUNITY SERVICES AYE WE WERE HOPING THAT THAT COMBINATION OF FLEXIBILITY IN COLLABORATION AROUND HOW. AND AND ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE OUTCOMES WOULD. TO BE THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH DIVERSION IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE AS LONG AS THERE'D HEARING TO EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES OF I'M AYE. SEQUENTIAL INTERCEPT JAIL DIVERSION. SO I SEE WHERE YOU'RE. GOING WITH THIS AND I APPRECIATE IT I GUESS DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS. AT HOW DO WE GET COUNTY TO HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME HOW. WOULD YOU WE'VE SAID THAT THEY WILL. CONTRIBUTE TWENTY PERCENT OF COUNTY FUNDS TO MATCH STATE FUNDS. HOW HOW CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT INTO THIS AND SECOND HOW DO HOW DO WE AFTER WE'VE COLLECTED OUTCOMES HAVE ANY AMOUNT OF OVERSIGHT OVER? THE COUNTIES IF THEY DO NOT MEET THE THRESHOLDS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE TWENTY OR THIRTY PERCENT REDUCTIONS AND ICED TEA REFERRALS. IT SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE MONEY GOING OUT BUT ONCE IT GOES OUT WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'M. HESITANT BASED OFF OF OUR DISCUSSION LAST WEEK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. TO GO THROUGH THIS WITHOUT A HARD AND. PLAN THAT'S BEFORE US EVEN THOUGH WERE ADDRESSING A CRITICAL. SYMPTOM AND DISEASE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS ON TRYING TO. REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD PLACE IF. YOU DON'T HAVE HARD ANSWERS NOW IS.

SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTY THINKING. THANK YOU SHARE CHAIR DR ADAM ALONG. A NEW BALANCE OF THE S. DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO DO A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. WITH IT THINKING SO WITH RESPECT TO THE FIVE PROJECTS AND FENDI VIEW ALL FIVE OF THEM ARE CONTINUING EXISTING PROJECTS. FOUR OF THE FIVE PROJECTS ARE CONSTRUCTION EITHER TO STAR AND ARE A COMPLETE ITS CONSTRUCTION AND THREE OF THEM ARE REAPPROPRIATION. ALL OF THE FIVE EXISTING PROJECTS ARE EITHER FIRE LIFE SAFETY OR THEIR PATIENT RELATED. WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST ISSUE COALINGA NEW ACTIVITY COURTYARD WE ARE ASKING FOR EVERY APPROPRIATION OF FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE. WERE EXPECTING CONSTRUCTION TO START JUNE OR JULY OF THIS YEAR. FOR THE NEXT ON FOR THE METROPOLITAN CONSOLIDATION OF POLICE OPERATIONS IT WOULD BE TO SUPPORT THE WORKING DRAWINGS PHASE AND WE ARE REQUESTING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. THE NEXT ONE ALSO IDEA SAGE METROPOLITAN FOR THE CT FIRE ALARM SYSTEM UPGRADE OR REQUESTING THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AND IT IS A REAPPROPRIATION. IT WOULD SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION FUNDING AND WE'RE EXPECTING CONSTRUCTION TO STAR IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR. FOR THE PATENT FIRE ALARM SYSTEM UPGRADE WERE REQUESTING NINE POINT FOUR MILLION TO SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION AND WE ARE EXPECTING CONSTRUCTION TO START IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND FINALLY FOR THE LAST FUND ALL SET PATENT PATENT EXCUSE ME TO CONSTRUCT THE NAMING KITCHEN IT IS EVERY APPROPRIATION REQUEST. SPECIFIC FOR A CONSTRUCTION AND IT'S TO FINALIZE OUR CONSTRUCTION AND OR REQUESTING THIRTY THREE POINT ZERO EIGHT SIX MILLION AND FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND IT WOULD BE TO SUPPORT THE FINAL PHASE OF THE CONTINUING PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THIS APPROPRIATION THIS REAPPROPRIATION BUT ALLOW US TO. HAVE THE DISH NO TIME FOR THE ENCUMBRANCE PERIOD. THE BERMAN FINANCE FELLOW. JONATHAN PETERSON WITH THE LA A WE DID HAVE ONE. CONCERN ON THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER FOR THE KITCHEN ANTAEUS EACH PATTON WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE REQUESTED AMOUNT TO FINISH THE PROJECT. HAVE HAVE A RELATIVELY MINOR TECHNICAL BUDGETING ISSUE SINCE THE TWO POINT NINE MILLION NEEDED TO FINISH THE PROJECT WAS NEVER ENCUMBERED BEFORE. THE EXPIRATION OF THE ENCUMBRANCE PERIOD WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE REPORT RE APPROPRIATED INSTEAD WE. WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE IF THE DEPARTMENT SOUGHT A NEW APPROPRIATION FOR THIS TWO POINT NINE MILLION. TO COMPLETE THE KITCHEN. KRILLIN ROBIN HER SUPPORT AND FINANCE AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY AGREE APPROPRIATE THEM WHEN THEY COME IN STRAIGHT HAS EXPIRED. WHILE THE LION'S SHARE OF REVERBERATIONS DO DEAL WITH RE APPROPRIATING FORTS EXPIRED WE DO ALSO ROUTE REPURPOSE THEM WHEN THEY HAVE EXPIRED SO FOR EXAMPLE. THEM WITH THE S. H. THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THAT M. WOULD NEED TO HAVE BEEN. ENCUMBERED WITHIN THREE YEARS AT THE END OF. A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT BUILDING AT NIGHT THAT AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND. NINE TEN IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO OF BEEN ENCUMBERED AND THEN THERE'S TWO YEARS TO LIQUIDATE AFTER THAT. AND IT WAS NOT DONE AND IT WAS REALLY APPROPRIATE TO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN BUDGET ACT SO. WELL IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE REVERBERATIONS THAT DEFINITELY CAN BE DONE AND I WOULD SAY IT PROBABLY ISN'T EVERY YEAR. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. XENON ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN FOR NOW AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S MEETING THANK YOU ALL
