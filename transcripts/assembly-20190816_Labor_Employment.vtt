IN CALIFORNIA THIS DID A FEW

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.427
THINGS BUT- ONE THING IT DID

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:59.031

MOMENTUM AND HAVE A FOUNDATION

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:05.504
WE DIDN'T HAVE A DEFINITION OF

WHAT A WORKER COOPERATIVE WAS

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:09.241

AND ADVOCATE FOR CITY SUPPORT

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.312

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.416
DEFINITION. AT THE STATE LEVEL

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:21.320
THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD FROM.

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:21.954
AND ALSO PART OF THE WORK THAT

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:23.656
WE DO IS NOT ONLY BUILDING

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:25.858
THOSE LAWS BUT ACTUALLY EMPOWER

PEOPLE TO SEE THAT ELVES AS-

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.128
THE ADVOCATE. ON THE ELVES AND

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.363
SO WE COULD AND WORKER OWNERS.

FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. HELD

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.234

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:35.801
AREAS OF THE LAW THAT ARE

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.236

WERE ADVOCATING WITH WORKER

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:50.983

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.985
SOME CHANGES THAT HAD DONE BEEN

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:53.552

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.671
WEALTH GAP. SO THIS IS A

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:47.606
HIGHLIGHT HERE IS DOOR ON

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.841
CAROLINA SO ALL THE FOCUS IS

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:53.445
ON. ASIA SHIP ALSO DEAL WITH

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:57.716
THAT IT'S. ONE OF THE BLOCK ST

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:01.253

HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:17.956
IMPACT ON BUSINESSES BABY

BOOMERS OWN. ABOUT THREE

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.463
HUNDRED THOUSAND MRS IN OUR

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:25.997
STATE THEM BY ALMOST THREE

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:29.667
MILLION ALL. I'M IS SEE THAT

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:32.904
THEY'LL OF THIS COME THESE ARE.

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:35.240
THEN SIX IN. LIZ IS OVER A

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:39.144
HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THE ANSWER.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.112
ECONOMIC FORCE AND BECAUSE OF

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:41.679
MOST PEOPLE ARE HUMAN MOST

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:42.947
BUSINESS AND AS A HUMAN THEY

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:45.016
DON'T PLAN VERY WELL INTO THE

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:45.650
FUTURE FOR THE LONG TERM RIGHT

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.117
OR AT LEAST FOR THEIR

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.318
RETIREMENT AND SO MANY OF THESE

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:49.320
BUSINESSES ACTUALLY ARE

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:51.122
CLOSING. SOME ARE BEING

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:53.358
PURCHASED BY COMPETITORS OR BY

00:29:53.424 --> 00:29:55.160
LARGER CORPORATIONS AND THAT

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.295
OFTEN REALLY UNDERMINES THE

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:59.164
LOCAL ROOTS OF THOSE COMPANIES

00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.764
AND OFTEN CREATES LAYOFFS AND

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.368
OTHER OTHER CHANGES THAT ARE

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:03.968
NOT VALUABLE THANK NOT HELPFUL

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:07.372
TO COMMUNITIES. IT'S ACTUALLY

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:09.374
ONLY 15% OF BUSINESSES THAT

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.209
SUCCEED TO THE NEXT GENERATION

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.278
THESE DAYS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.513
AND TIRING SIX OUT OF TEN OUR

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.148
PLAN TO SELL COMPANIES AND

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.217
THEIR NOT LOOK TO THE POTENTIAL

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:23.121
BUYERS UNDER THOSE UP RIGHT IN

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:23.655
OFFICE OR FACT BECAUSE THE

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.156
PEOPLE THEY WERE. EVERY OUR

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:25.790
POTENTIAL BUYERS AND AS WE'VE

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:27.158
ALL MENTIONED THERE'S AN

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:27.725
IMMENSE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:28.293
CONVERT THESE BUSINESSES TO

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:31.396
BROAD BASED EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP.

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:31.996
JUST A BRIEF WORD ABOUT WHAT

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:35.500
WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT. BY BROAD

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:36.167
BASE WE MEAN THAT THIS IS NOT A

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:39.270
MAN BY THIS IS A BALLOT THAT

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.573
ALL EMPLOYEES WHO BASIC OF

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:42.140
OCCASIONS IN THAT ARE YOU A

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.641
FULL TIME REAP BURKE X. THE

00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:45.743
WEEK BEEN WITH THE COMPANY AT

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.144
LEAST HERE. THOSE

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.579
QUALIFICATIONS. I'M NOT A

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:51.349
DEGREE AS- LEVEL OR YOU KNOW

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.318
MANAGE PROBLEM. I'M ALSO THAT

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:55.119
THE PROFITS ARE SHARED IN REAL

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.021
TIME BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:57.622
IMPORTANT AND THERE'S ANOTHER

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.890
MODEL OF EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP

00:30:58.957 --> 00:30:59.490
THAT DOES FOCUS ON RETIREMENT

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.292
SAVINGS WHICH IS VITAL THAT'S

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:03.261
THE SOP. AND SOME OF THOSE ALSO

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:05.730
DO WHAT ALL WORKER COOPERATIVES

00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:07.265
DO WHICH IS TO SHARE PROFITS

00:31:07.332 --> 00:31:09.067
EVERY YEAR WITH WITH THE MEMBER

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:11.469
OWNERS. THIS QUESTION OF IS

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.870
BROAD BASED EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:13.371
DEMOCRATIC JUST A BRIEF

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.240
REFERENCE IN WORKER COOPS IT IS

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.008
BECAUSE THE WORKING MEMBERS

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:17.609
CONTROL THE BOARD AND MAKE UP

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:19.410
THE MAJORITY OF BOARD MEMBERS.

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.379
THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ALSO

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.214
IN OTHER FORMS OF EMPLOYEE

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:25.049
OWNERSHIP LIKE THE SOCK. SO

00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:31.322
VERY BRIEFLY JUST AN OVERVIEW.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.923
HERE WHICH CAN TODAY PRIMARILY

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:37.395
ABOUT WERE COOPERATIVE. THE

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.397
BEST MODEL. DOCTOR PLAN IS

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:41.466
THERE ARE STEVEN THOUSAND

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:42.000
COMPANY IN THE CASE TODAY

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:45.436
PASSAGE PLAN. I'M OF A 100%

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:49.274
OWNERS. SOME OF THEM A SMALL

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.209
NUMBER BUT IT'S VERY POSSIBLE

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:51.843
THAT GREAT CREDIT PRACTICE INTO

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.745
SOME AS WELL AND THERE'S

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:54.379
SOMETHING CALLED THE EMPLOYEE

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:54.979
OWNERSHIP TRUST THAT HAS BEEN

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:55.713
PRACTICED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.314
FOR MANY YEARS AND IS ANYWHERE

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:56.848
IN THE US THAT CREATES AN

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:59.717
ADDITIONAL OPTION. THERE THERE

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:03.688
IS QUITE A BIT OF DATA. I TAKE

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:04.188
THE- STATUS I THOUGHT UP

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.859
MANAGED TO. I'M IN MY OWN

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.494

INCLUDE BUSINESSES HE IN THE

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:12.997
SEX IS THE BAY AREA THAT

NATIONAL HEARING CENTERS A. T.

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:17.402
WHICH IS ALSO. A GREEN BUSINESS

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:18.002
AND DAVE SMITH MORRIS TODAY

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:19.070
FROM TEAM WORKS. I'M IN IN THE

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:19.604
ONES THAT WE WORK WITH WE

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:20.238
ACTUALLY RIGOROUSLY MEASURE THE

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.205
IMPACT ON FAMILY INCOMES

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:23.241
INDIVIDUAL WORKER OWNERS WERE

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.009
DOUBLING AND TRIPLING THEIR

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:25.543
PERSONAL INCOMES THEY WERE

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.412
BECOMING PRIMARY BREAD WINNERS

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.213
AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT WAS

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.882
INCREASING FAMILY INCOMES BY

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:31.449
FORTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. SO

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:36.988
THAT WAS PROFOUND BENEFIT. FOR

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:37.588
LOW INCOME LATINO WORKERS HERE

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.290
IN THE BAY AREA. ALSO JUST JUST

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.492
TOUCH ON THE NEXT ONE STABILITY

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.127
FOR WORKERS IS ALSO PROFOUND IN

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:43.761
THE GREAT RECESSION. IF THERE

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:46.998
IS A NUMBER OF. IMPRESSIVE DATA

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:47.632
POINTS NOW AND THIS IS ONE THAT

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.267
THE LESS THAN 3% OF EMPLOYEE

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:51.002
OWNERSHIP EMPLOYEE OWNERS WERE

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:51.569
LAID OFF AND IN TWENTY TEN.

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.438
THIS IS 12% OF NON EMPLOYEE

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:55.373
OWNERS. SO THERE ARE MANY

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.907
ADVANTAGES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:59.310

DISTURBING HOME TO THE

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.316
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL YOU'LL HEAR

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:05.883

ELECTRIC ARREST RECURRENT.

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:21.632
ANGLE I'M WHO BECAME A CO OP.

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:28.906

OF THEIR CONVERSION. AND THIS

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.916
PAST YEAR THEY SHARED WITH US

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:40.985
THAT THAT PROFIT SHARING FOR

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:41.452
THE WORK ON THIS WAS A

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.053
PREVALENT TO FIVE DOLLARS AN

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.156

TRULY REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT'S

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:28.866
WHY HUMAN AGENDA IS SUPPORTING

00:39:28.933 --> 00:39:30.968
WORKER OWNED COOPERATIVES

NATURE THEY ARE MORE KIND ALSO

00:40:27.424 --> 00:40:31.028
BECAUSE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:31.595
THAT WORK TOGETHER MAKING

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.997

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.470
INCREASE WHAT BUT OFTENTIMES

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.938
ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:37.074
THAT COULD CONTINUE. AND SO.

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.944
WHAT SPECIFICALLY. DOES PROJECT

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.080
EQUITY DUE TO HELP IN THAT

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:45.315
TRANSITION YEAH. YEAH WE DO

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:47.384
EVERYTHING THAT WE BELIEVE IS

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.353
NEEDED. I'M AND THEN WE BRING

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.288
IN LEGAL AND CPA SUPPORT TO

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:53.123
SUPPLEMENT THAT THE TECHNICAL

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.791
EXPERTISE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SORT

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.426
OF THE GENERALIST IN THE

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:55.893
PROCESS WERE BUSINESS

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.461
GENERALISTS. THE FIRST STEP IS

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.931
USUALLY FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:02.966
AND THAT FOCUSES A LOT ON.

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.835
FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:05.436
SPECIFICALLY THROUGH THE LENS

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:07.237
OF DEBT CAPACITY. BECAUSE MOST

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.239
WORKERS AS I THINK WE ALL WOULD

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:15.379
ASSUME. ARE NOT SHOWING UP WITH

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:19.116
A LARGE CHECK TO PAY THE. TING

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:19.750
OWNER FOR THE BUSINESS AND IN

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.385
FACT WE GENERALLY WITH WORKER

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:23.287
COOPERATIVES THE WORKER OWNER

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:23.854
BY AND THEIR INITIAL EQUITY

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:24.488
INVESTMENT. CAN BE PAID THROUGH

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.422
PAYROLL DEDUCTION OVER A YEAR

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:26.023
OR MORE BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.324
SHOWING UP WITH A CAPITAL WE

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:27.925
KNOW AMERICANS. PEOPLE IN THE

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.393
U. S. DON'T HAVE SAVINGS SO

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.130
GENERALLY SPEAKING. SO WE LOOK

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:35.332
AT WHAT HOW MUCH DEBT COULD THE

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.301
BUSINESS POTENTIALLY TAKE ON IF

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:37.868
IT WERE TO BECOME A WORKER

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.336
COOPERATIVE THAT CO OP WOULD BE

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.205
ABLE TO POTENTIALLY GET A LOAN

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.940
FROM A CD A FIRE FROM A LOAN

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:43.540
FUND LIKE THE ONE WE'RE WHAT.

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.442
WE'RE LAUNCHING OR OTHERS THAT

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.277
ARE AVAILABLE. AND THE SELLER

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.346
WOULD FINANCE PART OF IT AND

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.014
GET PAID OFF OVER TIME. I'M

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.283
OFTEN WE'RE SEEING THE SELLER

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.152
TAKE ON MAYBE 3250% AS A NOTE

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.254
AND THEN THAT THE OUTSIDE

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:01.258
FUNDERS TAKE ON 5270% AND WE

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.127
NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH DEBT

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:05.028
COULD THEY AFFORD TO TAKE ON

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:05.696
AND STILL BE A HEALTHY BUSINESS

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.397
AND STILL HAVE SOME PROFIT TO

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.133
SHARE. IN PATRONAGE DIVIDENDS

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:09.800
SO THAT'S A LOT OF OUR WORK IN

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:11.101
THE FEASIBILITY STAGE IS TO

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:13.103
ASSESS THAT AND THEN TO TALK

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.704
WITH THE OWNER WHAT WHAT ARE

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.305

NEED WHAT DO THEY EXPECT IN

00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.241
TERMS OF PRICE AND HOW TO THOSE

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.276
THINGS MATCH. AND WE ALSO LOOK

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:19.910
AT MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.478
COMPANY. AND THE OWNER OFTEN

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:23.046
WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:24.948
BEEN OWNED BY THE SAME PERSON

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:25.516

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:29.553
FLEDGED MANAGEMENT TEAM OR

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.427
MODEL IT EVEN EXISTS AND SO IF

00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:25.195
THERE WAS A STATE CENTER FOR

00:49:25.262 --> 00:49:27.264
EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP THEY COULD

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.999
BE ENGAGING WITH. AT LAW

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:29.599
SCHOOLS WITH BUSINESS SCHOOLS

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:31.368
TO GET INTO THE CURRICULUM

00:49:31.435 --> 00:49:35.038
UNDERSTANDING AND EDUCATION

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:35.605
AROUND DEMOCRATIC EMPLOYEE

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.274
OWNERSHIP AS SOMETHING FOR

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.142
THEIR STUDENTS ACTUALLY

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.111
LEARNING BE INTERESTED IN AND

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:41.678
THEN MOVE OUT INTO THE WORLD

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:42.979
AND BE SKILLED. SKILLED IN

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:45.415
OTHER THINGS THAT THE STATE

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:47.417
EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP CENTER COULD

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.353
DO IS LIKE HELLER WAS TALKING

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:52.989
ABOUT HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:53.623
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.158
BE ABLE TO UNLOCK THE GROWTH OF

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:57.327
COOPERATIVES. SO WORKING WITH

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:59.062
THIS WITH THE STATE IF THERE

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:01.365
WAS A LOAN PROGRAM WHERE IF A

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:03.266
FUND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.369
RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.204
EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE COULD TAP

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.306
INTO. SO STEWARDING THAT

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.174
SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:11.808
AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.443
IT'S NOT ONLY ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.013
THE STATE BUT ALSO ACCOUNTABLE

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:17.581
TO. THE LABOR COMMUNITY IN

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.182
GENERAL SO HOW IS THAT

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.218
STRUCTURED ITSELF SO THEY COULD

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:27.057
SUPPORT IN AND CREATING IN.

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:27.557
STEWARDING IT AS WELL SO

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:32.796
THERE'S JUST A FEW IDEAS. YEAH

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:35.098
AND I THINK ONE MODEL TO LOOK

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:35.665
AT IS THE RECENT REFUNDING

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.200
ACTUALLY THE MAIN OF THE

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:37.801
MASSACHUSETTS SIMPLY ENERGY

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.269
CENTER SO I WAS STARTED TO

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.071
BELIEVE IN THE LATE SEVENTIES

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:41.638
EARLY EIGHTIES WAS FUN FOR

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.140
AWHILE TO DO THAT TYPE OF WORK

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:43.740
TO RICARDO SPEAKING ABOUT AND

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.509
THEN YOU KNOW IS A IS A BUDGET

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.144
LINE ITEM THAT WENT AWAY IN

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.079
FACE OF OTHER PRIORITIES BUT

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:49.679
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY URGENT

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.981
ISSUE WHILE IN STATES ALL

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:51.415
AROUND THE COUNTRY.

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.150
MASSACHUSETTS REFUNDED THE

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:53.683
PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THAT

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.385
ASSISTANCE SO I THINK THAT'S

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:58.955
THAT'S A RESTORED THE CONFLICT.

00:50:59.022 --> 00:50:59.589
THAT AND POTENTIALLY REPLICATED

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:03.193
HERE IN THE STATE. I WOULD

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.328
ALSO. ADD THAT WORKING WITH THE

00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:09.065
LOCAL LABOR COUNCIL. THERE ARE

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:11.168
MODELS OF A UNION COOP

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.236
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. EXAMPLE

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.272
IN CINCINNATI WHERE STEEL

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.107
WORKERS IN THE RETAIL CLERKS.

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:19.042
HAVE ACTUALLY BOUGHT

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:21.111
BUSINESSES. AND ARE CONTINUING

00:51:21.178 --> 00:51:21.645
AS UNION MEMBERS BUT ALSO

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:25.081
WORKER OWNERS. AND SO THIS IS

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:25.649
SOMETHING WORKING WITH THE

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.250
LOCAL ORGANIZED LABOR THEY CAN

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:27.784
IDENTIFY WHEN A BUSINESS

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:29.486
CLOSES. AND THEY CAN MOVE IN

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.354
WITH THE RIGHT OF FIRST

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.123
REFUSAL. THEY CAN HAVE A GOLDEN

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:37.093
OPPORTUNITY. TO KEEP JOBS LOCAL

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.229
IN THE COMMUNITY. AND NOT

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:41.131
DISRUPT THE FAMILIES THAT

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:41.665
OTHERWISE WOULD LOSE THEIR

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:45.469
POSITIONS. THANK YOU. IS THERE

FIGHT IS LOOK IT WITH THE GOOD.

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:27.096
THE ACTION IS IN STRUCTURE OF

00:59:27.163 --> 00:59:29.198
HOW THEY HATE ENTER WHAT THE

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:31.167
STATE PACKAGE IT MIGHT LOOK

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.303

HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY FUND THAT

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:41.511
AND TO GET PEOPLE THINKING

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.045
DIFFERENTLY ON HOW THEY

APPROACH. THE BUSINESS AND THE

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.150
STRATEGY AROUND THAT. LOOKING

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:47.750
AT HOW THE COMPANY'S GOING TO

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:49.419
GROW AND WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:49.986
AGAIN WE HAVE THE BOARD IS

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.354

WORKERS THEY IT'S NOT LIKE

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:55.992

ACTUAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION. I

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:07.470
SAW THIS THIS MORE AS A

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:13.076
POTENTIAL. A CAREER PATH NOW

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:13.643
THIS IS BEFORE I DON'T THINK

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.210

BUT NOW ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING AT

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.317
WAYS TO CREATE A MECHANISM TO

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.019
ALLOW PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THIS AS

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.021
A LONG TERM THING OUT I DID

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:25.688

SO FOR OPPORTUNITIES THINGS

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.131
THAT TO THINK ABOUT LIKE

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.166

ME IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:09.866
ACCOUNTABILITY ROLE THAN WHEN I

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.367

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.310
WAS BEFORE BUT- IT TAKES THAT.

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.346
THAT CHOICE OUT OF THE MIX I

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:23.913
GUESS IT MAKES A LITTLE MORE

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.248
DIFFICULT. WE WERE VERY

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.183
EMPOWERED WORKFORCE WE ALWAYS

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:27.817

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.185
ACTUALLY GIVES THEM THE CHOPS

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.087
TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING AND

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.922
RUN WITH THAT. AND CREATING A-

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:35.258
A LEGACY FOR NOT JUST THE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:35.792
BUSINESS BUT ALSO FOR THE

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.961
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THERE AND

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.531
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WE

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.633
SPOKE ABOUT. THE LAST PANEL IS

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.267
NEED FOR EDUCATION AND NOT JUST

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.668
THE EDUCATION OF THE

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.904
INDIVIDUALS WERE THERE BY THE

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.973
CASE IN THE DISTRICT. ANY VÀ

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.042
BRING PEOPLE AND SINGLE YES

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.643
THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST ONE

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.044
OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGED. SO I

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.180
TIMES TIMES TIGHT SO I'M GONNA

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.082
JUMP RIGHT TO MY FINAL SITE IS

01:01:59.148 --> 01:01:59.682
HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE HELP

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.717
LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.653
ASKED WE CAN MAKE OF THE

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.721
LEGISLATURE. AND THE FIRST IS

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.890
BROWN THE PROPOSAL GET IT. FOR

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.792
THOSE OF YOU IN IN IN IN

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.627
BUSINESS OR PERSONAL LIFE

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:21.704
PERSONAL GUARANTEE. THIS IS ARE

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.305
YOU HAVE WILL THROW TO. ACCEPT

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:31.481
THE. I AND AS IF ANY CAN TELL

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:32.014
US IF YOU HAVE A LOOK. THE

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:35.318
LANDLORD WANTS TO MAKE SURE

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:35.885
THEY GET THEIR RAN. OVER TO

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:41.357
LEAST. THEY NEED A SINGLE

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:41.958
PERSON THAT THE VIEW OF CHASER

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:45.027
CITY MA'AM. CARE ABOUT HOW TO

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:45.661

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:51.801
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:54.937
HOW TO RESOLVE THAT AND DO

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:55.538

SB A WHO WHOEVER BUT THAT IS A

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:01.544
REAL ISSUE BECAUSE IT PUTS

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.979
INDIVIDUALS. CERTAIN

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:03.646
INDIVIDUALS AT A AT MORE RISK

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.983
WHICH IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:07.617

BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WE

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:14.243
HAVE ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.110
PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THIS.

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.179
FAMILY OF COOPERATIVES BUT- YOU

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.448
CAN IMAGINE IF THERE WAS A

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.216
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A GRAND

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.385
SCALE OF SUPPORT. OF THE AMOUNT

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.220
OF CAPACITY THAT WE COULD REACH

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:27.222
FOR AS WELL WOULD BE THAT MUCH

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:31.160
MORE. AND ALSO I WANTED TO

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:33.062
MENTION AS FAR AS NORMALIZING

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:35.130
THE IDEA OF COOPERATIVES AND

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:35.764
KIND OF GETTING AWAY OF THAT

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.333
STERRY TO GET AWAY FROM THE

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:37.967
STEREOTYPE OF SOMETHING THAT'S

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.401
KIND OF LIKE A HIPPY DIPPY

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.370
THING. I WANT TO KIND OF MAKE

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:42.004
THE POINT THAT LIKE YOU KNOW

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.439
THE CLOCKS IT'S NOT THE ROSE

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.240
COLORED GLASSES AS FAR AS LIKE

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.076
EVERYTHING'S OKEY DOKEY WITH

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.144
COPS AND WE ALL. LOVE EACH

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:49.712
OTHER AND LIVE IN THE SAME

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.980
HOUSE AND DO EVERYTHING

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:51.580
TOGETHER COULD MEALS TOGETHER.

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:54.984
IT'S A NORMAL BUSINESS WE HAVE.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.086
INTENSE DISCUSSIONS OF THAT

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:57.720
LEAD TO INTENSE ARGUMENTS THAT

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.521
LEAD TO VERY LONG MEDIANS BUT

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:03.025
IT'S ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. WHEN

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:03.659
I FIRST YOU KNOW WAS TALKING TO

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.494
AT KIRK ABOUT. YOU KNOW I WAS

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.229
REACHING OUT TO FOLKS WERE LIKE

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:07.863
WHY IS THIS LET NOT A NORMAL

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.365
THING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:13.035
YOUR KID. YOU'RE EXCITED TO GET

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.104
THE CHANCE TO VOTE YOU TURN

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:15.704
EIGHTEEN YOU GET TO VOTE THEN

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:16.972
YOU BECOME AND EMPLOYEES

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:19.341
SOMEPLACE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.343
SAY. AND WHAT COMES TO WHAT'S

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.145
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:25.381
THAT. CO OPS EVEN IF IT'S A

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:29.084
DYSFUNCTIONAL COP IT'S A COOP

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:35.224
AND YOU HAVE A SAY. IN THAT AND

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:35.791
YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A VOICE TO

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:43.365
TRY TO. COOPER OVER. KIND OF

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.367
JOB BECAUSE AT LEAST HAVE A

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:45.968
VOICE AND YOU HAVE SOME AGENCY

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:46.935
TO TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING. I

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:49.204
THINK THAT IS WHAT'S MORE

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.973
NORMAL ABOUT COOPS IN OTHER

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.573
COUNTRIES WERE PEOPLE SAY ALL

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.207
OF THIS CALL THE BACKUP IS LIKE

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.242
WHATEVER WHATEVER. IT THAT IT'S

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:55.611
JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW IT'S PART

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.279
OF LIFE IT'S THIS BUSINESS OF

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.881
THAT BUSINESS IT'S COOPS COULD

01:11:58.947 --> 01:11:59.448
BE GREAT COPS ARE NOT GREAT

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.015
COPS BUT IT'S A COOP AND YOU

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.383
HAVE AGENCY TO CREATE. THAT

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:01.984
WITH YOUR VOICE IN WITH YOUR

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.218
VOTE AND THAT'S THE MOST

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.154
IMPORTANT THING THAT I FEEL.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.489
COULD BE SHARED AND FOR PEOPLE

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.224
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.993
HAVE A CO OP AND YOUR

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.095
STEWARDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.097
IT'S NOT I MEAN YOU'RE DOING

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:15.731
WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING MORE

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.232
FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR DOING

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:19.001
WELL FOR YOUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:19.535
THAT BUSINESS THRIVE. AND

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.336
YOU'RE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD FOR

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.405
THAT BUSINESS TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:27.309
BEYOND YOUR. WITHOUT BEYOND

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:29.311
YOUR TIME THERE SO WE TRY TO

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.146
KIND OF SEE THAT AS KIND OF A

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:32.981
LEGACY THING WITH AND OUR

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:33.449
NETWORKING WITHIN OUR

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:33.882

COOPERATIVES IT THEMSELVES. AND

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:39.121
I HOPE THAT IDEA. THE KIND OF

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.223
GET AWAY FROM LIKE I SAID LIKE

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.425
SAID. TO KIND OF GET AWAY FROM

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:45.227
THE IDEA OF COOPS KIND OF BEING

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:47.129
UNDER ASSAULT BUT IT JUST IT'S

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.264
NORMAL IT'S YOU KNOW THE

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:49.865
CONVERSATION TO COMPROMISE THE

COMMUNICATION. AS LONG AS

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.235
EVERYBODY HAS A VOTE I THINK

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.137
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:55.771
AND WE KNOW THE ONE PERSON ONE

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.406
VOTE. IN THE UNITED STATES

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:57.906

THE GROWING ECONOMY AND THAT

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.978
KIND OF CONSTANT RESTRUCTURING

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:55.683
OF WORK. LEAVE BECAUSE OF A

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.251
MISSION AND OTHER AN ALMOND

01:25:56.317 --> 01:26:01.589

WORKFORCE MODELS THAT SHARE

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:19.774
EQUITY GAINS ACROSS THE WORK

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.342
FORCE. TO KIND OF FIGHT THAT

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:23.444
TIED OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.146
PEOPLE'S LABOR. AND SO WE SAW

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.348
THAT WE SAW WITH THE LVM WORKER

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:27.916
COOPS WHICH I'LL TELL YOU A

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.183
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN A MINUTE

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:29.717
THAT THERE'S ALSO REALLY

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.219
SERIOUS STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.921
OF MARRYING ARE PARTNERING

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:35.056
UNIONS THEN COLLAPSED TO GIVE

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:37.191
PEOPLE. ACCESS TO BENEFITS AND

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:41.029
PORTABILITY OF BENEFITS. AND

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:43.197
YOU KNOW BUT ALSO REAL WORK

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:47.101
PRETTY PLACE PROTECTIONS. THAT

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:47.702
ARE BEING A ROAD IN ALL KINDS

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:48.202
OF WAYS ELSEWHERE IN THE

01:26:48.269 --> 01:26:51.639
ECONOMY. SO I THINK SOME PEOPLE

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:53.875
ARE KIND OF LIKE WHAT IS THE

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.476

JUST VERY QUICKLY DESCRIBE THAT.

01:26:57.645 --> 01:27:03.685
IT'S NOT REAL. UNION AND THEN

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:07.422
IT SORT OF EMPLOYER WOULD RACK.

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:13.795
BOB WORKERS. A SET OF WORKERS

THAT AGREEMENT SO THAT'S IT IN

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:25.173
THAT WAY I BELIEVE IT'S SIMILAR

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:25.740
THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THE

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.141
VALUES ALIGNMENT THAT I WAS

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:27.742
TALKING ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:28.943
THE COOP IS BASICALLY

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:31.112
INHERENTLY TIED TO THE SUCCESS

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:33.047
OF THE UNION. AND OF COURSE

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:33.648
BECAUSE OF THE COOP STRUCTURE

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:37.185
INSTEAD OF THERE BEING LIKE AN

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.120
ADVERSARIAL SORT OF BOSS WORKER

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:40.989
DYNAMIC THERE IS AN

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:43.257
ACCOUNTABILITY LOOP AND THERE'S

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:45.259
A LIKE A BUILT IN CHECK ON

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:50.965
POWER THAT DISABLES A SUBSET.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:51.599
OF PEOPLE FROM CAPITALIZING OFF

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:57.238
THE LABOR OF OTHERS. SO I'M A

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:59.574
TWENTY. TELL YOU ABOUT THE ALL

TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS YOU

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:25.066
WENT THROUGH. IS THE DIFFICULTY

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:29.203
GETTING FINANCING. THAT YOU

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.804
WENT TO TRADITIONAL BANKS AND

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:33.307
CAN GET FINANCING. AND I KNOW

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.142
THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.743
INCLUDING AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.445

THAT LIKE HOW DO WE GET BEYOND

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:43.184
THAT FINANCING HURDLE IN THE

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:43.818
PRIOR PANEL TO TALK ABOUT WAYS

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:44.418
A STAKE IN THE HELP. BUT IS

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:45.586
THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT YOU

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:46.120
SEEN IN TERMS OF CREATING

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:47.421
COOPER IS ARE THERE OTHER

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:47.955
ISSUES THAT. ARE ON EQUAL

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:51.492
FOOTING. WELL I THINK. I THINK

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.260
IT COMES DOWN TO MONEY I THINK

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:53.928
IT DOES DEFINITELY COME DOWN TO

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:55.363
MONEY BECAUSE I MEAN IT

01:33:55.429 --> 01:33:55.963
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO.

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.331
START A BUSINESS YOU'RE YOU

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.000
NEED THAT CAPITAL RIGHT. AND

01:33:59.066 --> 01:33:59.567
NORMALLY WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.235
WORKERS THE DON'T HAVE. YOU

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.471
KNOW THAT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.106
PUT INTO A BUSINESS. WELL WE

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:07.208
STARTED PEOPLE WERE BUYING AND

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.943
IT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:09.577
AND NOW IT. IF THE BUSINESSES

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:11.212
ARE SUCCESSFUL I'M PAID BACK

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:13.214
THEIR BANK LOANS IS DOWN TO ONE

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:13.748
THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. SO

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.216
NORMALLY SOME IS COMING TO THE

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.084
BUSINESS AS HILLARY SAID AND

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:21.055
THEY'RE JUST TAKING THAT. AND

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:21.655
PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS SO YOU NEED

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:25.192
THE CAPITAL TO START. THIS

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.194
THAT'S THE- MAIN THING AND

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.963
SINCE IT'S A COOPERATIVE I

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.563
THINK IT'S HARDER. AND IT'S

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.098
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT THE NORM

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:31.732
UNITED STATES SOMETHING THAT'S

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.134
HARDER TO GET. FINANCE THE

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.169
OTHER CHALLENGES WOULD BE JUST

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.937
CHALLENGES OF COMPROMISING

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.939
COMMUNICATION. AND THE NORMAL

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:41.208
JUST KIND OF LET'S GET THIS UP

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:43.377
AND RUNNING. BUT I. THINK THAT

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:45.479
IF THE FINANCES WERE THERE WHEN

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.415
PEOPLE APPROACH US SOME PEOPLE

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.250
APPROACH IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.052
BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:52.920
CREATE. YOU KNOW EIGHT.

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:55.022
COOPERATIVES IN THE BAY AREA

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:55.623
THAT ARE DOING VERY WELL. AND

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:57.191
THEY APPROACH US AND THEY'RE

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:57.758
LIKE OH WE WANTED THERE'S A

01:34:57.825 --> 01:34:59.226
MANDY AND YOU KNOW. UP IN

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:01.429
ARCADIA. AND I WAS LIKE OH WELL

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.464
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.031
LIKE THIS YOU'RE GONNA NEED

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.266
LIKE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.168

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.136
GOING TO GET. YOU KNOW WHO'S

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:11.138
GOING TO SIGN OFF ON THAT. SO

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:13.374
YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL CONUNDRUM

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.309
TO ME ESPECIALLY SINCE WE-

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:19.013

COOPERATIVE COMMUNITY THROUGH

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.284
THE CHEESE BOARD. SO IT DOESN'T

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:25.052
SEEM LIKE THE THERE'S AN- THINK

01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:25.653
THE THINGS ARE NOT IN PLACE

GET GROUNDS ON FUNDING BECAUSE

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:47.154
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS YOU WE

ALL KNOW HERE. AS FUNDING I WE

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:51.158
START WITH MY OURS WAS THE

WORKING OUT WITH SHOE STRINGS

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:01.234
BASICALLY BECAUSE OF THAT

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:04.938
FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THAT LONG

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.040
AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET.

LONGS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:16.950
BUT HOW DO YOU GET ALONG AND

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:17.484
THEN YOU HAVE TO PAY AND

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:19.386
WORKERS WE DON'T WANT TO BE ON

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.355
THE HOOK FOR THAT. SO IT WILL

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:23.457
BE GREAT TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:29.196
OPPORTUNITY TO GET SOME KIND OF.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO START

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:35.602
UP. COSTS AND WE'RE STILL KIND

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:43.076
OF DEALING WITH THAT.

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:43.677
APPRECIATE THAT AND SO WE'RE

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:44.344
GOING TO SEE THERE'S ANY PUBLIC

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:47.080

GET EDUCATION OUT INTO

01:45:23.283 --> 01:45:23.784

FOUND OURSELVES AS A NON PROFIT

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:25.752
IN THE MIDST OF HELPING TO

STATUS HOUSEHOLDS. I'M WE FOUND

01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:37.064
OURSELVES THERE BECAUSE OF A

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.099
NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT NOT

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:41.201
BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW TO DO IT SO

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:43.036
I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:45.372

ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PANELISTS

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:49.109
ORGANIZATION. HELPED US IN THE

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:49.643
TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND THE

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.178
CAPACITY BUILDING WE NEED TO

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:51.812
HELP GET THIS CALL UP OFF THE

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.380
GROUND. THAT IS LIKE THAT ONE

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.348
OF THE NUMBER ONE PHILOSOPHIES

01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:55.949
OF COOPS IN TERMS OF WORKING

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:59.252
AGAINST. COMPETITION BUT RATHER

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:01.188
COOPERATION AND SO THAT WAS

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:03.056
REALLY HELPFUL. BUT I THINK IT

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:03.690
TWO YEARS IN NOW SOME OF OUR

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.525
LEARNINGS THAT I WANTED TO HOLD

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:07.194
UP FOR ALL OF YOU IS THAT. THE

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.262
AMOUNT OF TIME IN

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:11.298
INTENTIONALITY ESPECIALLY WITH

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:11.932
WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR MOST

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:13.567
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES TO GET

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:15.469
THEM TO. HAVING A PROFITABLE

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:19.139
BUSINESS IS VERY INTENSIVE. OF

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:19.673
THE AMOUNT OF LEADERSHIP

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.241
DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT AT THE

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:23.343
AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:25.078
THAT'S REQUIRED ON THE FRONT

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:27.147
END. WHEN WE STARTED THIS

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:27.781
PROCESS WE DIDN'T KNOW ALL OF

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.382
THAT WAS GOING TO BE REQUIRED.

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:31.251
SO SIMILAR TO WHAT ELIZABETH

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:31.818
SAID YOU KNOW WE USED OUR

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:35.122
NONPROFIT STRUCTURE TO SECURE

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:35.655
PRIVATE FUNDING TO THEN.

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.591
REINVEST IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.459
INCUBATION OF A COOPERATIVE. I

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:41.361
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE MOST

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:43.396
SUSTAINABLE MODEL. IT ACTUALLY

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.265
THEN PERPETUATES COMPETITION

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:47.200
AMONGST NON PROFITS AS WELL. SO

01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:49.236
I THINK ANY WHERE YOU CAN HAVE

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:51.271
MORE PUBLIC FUNDS I'M INVESTING

01:46:51.338 --> 01:46:53.140
DIRECTLY INTO THESE KINDS OF

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:55.242
BUSINESSES THE BETTER. AND THEN

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:57.210
I WOULD ADD THAT YOU KNOW WHEN

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:57.844
YOU'RE LOOKING AT SB DC'S OR

01:46:57.911 --> 01:46:59.379
OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN INVEST

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:01.481
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. MAKING

01:47:01.548 --> 01:47:03.483
SURE THAT IT'S NOT ONLY ON THE

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.152
BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS. BUT ALSO

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.320
SUPPORTING THE SOFT SKILLS OF

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.122
COOPERATION NEGOTIATION.

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:11.324
CONFLICT RESOLUTION BECAUSE I

01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:11.892
THINK WE HAVE SOME OF THE

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:13.460
WORKERS HERE TODAY I MEAN I

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:13.994
THINK THOSE HAVE BEEN THE

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.562
HARDEST CONVERSATIONS. AND SO

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:17.497
WHEN YOU ARE COMING FROM A

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.466

FRAME. AND YOU'RE WANTING TO

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.236
BUILD COMMUNITY WHEN YOU

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:25.505
TRANSITION INTO THIS PLACE OF

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.374
