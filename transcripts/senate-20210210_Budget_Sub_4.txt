IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL REVIEW PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR RELATED TO REVENUE AND TAX DEPARTMENTS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THESE INCLUDE PROPOSALS NECESSARY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT ALSO PROPOSALS INTENDED TO ASSIST BUSINESSES AND TAXPAYERS MANY OF WHOM CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE HAVE A BOAT ONLY CALENDAR AND THE NUMBER OF DISCUSSION ITEMS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. WE WILL TAKE ACTION ON THE BOAT ONLY CALENDAR AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. THIRTY BEGINNING WITH THE DISCUSSION ITEMS- WELL WIT FOR WELL I WILL MOVE ON SINCE I SENATOR NELSON IS NOT HERE MONEY TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS SO NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST DISCUSSION ITEMS WHICH IS AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES TAX CREDIT AND CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM. LIKE TO INVITE THE DEPARTMENT TO PRESENT THE PROPOSAL. TATIAN OF CREDIT ALLOCATIONS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR FOR WHICH THE ADMINSTRATION'S REQUESTING A LEGISLATURE TAKE EARLY ACTION SECOND A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION OF CREDIT ALLOCATIONS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN THE THIRD COMPONENT IS A ONE TIME TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAL COMPETES GRANT PROGRAMS. THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE VERY MUCH INTENDED TO HELP BUSINESSES AND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA BY PROVIDING BUSINESSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE CREATE JOBS AND OTHER STATES WITH INCENTIVES TO CREATE. JOBS IN CALIFORNIA- THE GRANT PROGRAM FUNDING WELL ESTABLISHED GRANT COMPONENT. IN THE PROGRAM AND IT WILL HAVE A SIMPLER SELECTION PROCESS TO THE EXISTING KALKA PEACE PROGRAM BUT WITH A MORE TARGETED FOCUS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANT BUSINESSES WILL NEED TO MEET ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ESTABLISHED AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED NEW NET JOBS MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. COMMITTED TO HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREA OF THE STATE OR RECEIVE THE DESIGNATION FROM THE DIRECTOR OF KOBE IS THAT THE APPLICATION IS A STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR THE STATE- ESTABLISHING GRANT PROCUMBENT HOW CAN PEACEFUL EXPAND THE POOL BUSINESSES THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM- THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE GRANTS. ONE COMPANIES TO CONTINUOUSLY REINVEST THEIR PROFITS INTO THE BUSINESS. AND GENERATE LITTLE PRINT LITTLE PROFITS SMALLER BUSINESSES WITH WITH RELATIVELY LOW INCOME TAX LIABILITY AND THREE START UPS WITH LITTLE TO NO TAX LIABILITY. CAL COMPETES GRANT PROGRAM IS AN ADDITIONAL SENATE FOR BUSINESSES CONDUCTING MULTI STATE SITE SELECTION ANALYSES FOR FUTURE GROWTH. AND IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE APPLICANT POOL IN TERMS OF JOB CREATION. THE NEW PROGRAM WILL DEDICATE AT LEAST FIFTY MILLION OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS IN THE STATE. THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS SOME HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS I ALSO HAVE MY COLLEAGUE- MISTER SCOTT DISICK ON THE LINE FROM. GOBIZ I'M CALLING ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HELLO THIS IS BRIAN WEATHERFORD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE PREPARED A WRITTEN ANALYSIS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROPOSAL SO TODAY I'M ONLY GOING TO- HIT OR MAIN POINTS IN MY INITIAL REMARKS BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE IN A BIT MORE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE RECOMMEND NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. AND THAT MEANS ARE NOT APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CREDITS THE PROGRAM CAN WORD AND NOT APPROVING THE PROPOSAL TO ALLOW GO BIZ TO AWARD GRANTS OF UP TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO APPLICANTS THE PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT PAY TAXES THE BUSINESS ENTITY LEVEL. WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO BE DELIVERED OF AND NOT TO RUSH INTO PROVIDING LARGE GRANTS TO BUSINESSES AS PART OF. RELOCATION INCENTIVE DEALS UP UNTIL NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS STATED IT'S CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE. AND GRANTS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. AND MOREOVER WOULD EXPOSE THE STATE TO LOSSES OF THESE COMPANIES GO OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THAT'S NOT IDLE SPECULATION PROGRAM DATA FROM GO BEEN SHOWS THAT ONE THIRD OF THE CREDITS AWARDED DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF THE PROGRAM AND- CAPTURED. BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES DID NOT ACHIEVE THE HIRING INVESTMENT TARGETS THAT THEY COMMITTED TO. IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE AGREEMENTS DIDN'T WORK OUT. AND WHETHER CHANGES THE CHANGES MADE TO THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO DRESS THIS ISSUES BEFORE EXPANDING CALIFORNIA COMPETES. THE INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM AS A MISTER WHITE MENTIONED. IS TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE LOCATE HERE. WITHOUT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN INTEREST IN HELPING BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC THIS YEAR. SO TO THAT END YOU COULD CONSIDER REDIRECTING THE FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM. TO ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT MIGHT BETTER ALIGN WITH YOUR PRIORITIES SUCH AS THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH IS NOT ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS HEARING WHERE THE MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT. WHICH WILL BE HEARD LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW- I REPRESENT THE AREA IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE TEND TO BE THE- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- HOUSING AREA FOR THE JOBS THAT ARE LOCATED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WHERE I COME FROM MOSTLY THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE OTHERS TO AT LEAST CONSIDER AT SOME POINT PROBABLY NOT THIS YEAR DUE TO TIMING BUT AT SOME POINT IS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR JOB INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND OUR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. RULES REGULATIONS. INCENTIVES AND ASPIRATIONS HERE WE TEND TO INCENTIVIZE JOB CREATION AND EXPANSION IN AREAS OF THE STATE INCLUDING AS I SAID THE COASTAL URBAN AREAS. IS THAT ARE OFTEN SHORT OF HOUSING. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS DEVELOP A CLOSER LINK OR CORRELATION BETWEEN JOB INCENTIVES AND GUARANTEES THAT SUFFICIENT HOUSING TO HOUSE THE NEW EMPLOYEES THAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZING. IN THOSE AREAS EXIST IN THOSE AREAS OR AT LEAST A GUARANTEE THAT SUFFICIENT HOUSING WILL BE CONSTRUCTED- TIED TO THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO EITHER EXPAND JOBS OR RECRUIT JOBS FROM ONE AREA THE STATE TO THE OTHER. NOT A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT IN A REQUEST THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I. CENTER NIELSEN. WELL WE MEDICARE TO. ALLOW YOUR ECHO THE SENTIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE. BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN ON DIRECTING THIS TO THE ADMINISTRATION. TO MAKE THE CONNECTION. BETWEEN JOBS AND THE ABILITY TO THOSE ARE AN APPEAL AND FLOYD TO LIVE. THIS IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENA IT'S HISTORIC AND ENDEMIC AND IT'S AFFECTED A LOT OF US. THE AREAS THAT I'VE REPRESENTED THE NINETEEN COUNTIES OVER THE YEARS MOST OF THEM ARE MORE RURAL. BUT THEY ARE SO IMPACTED AND PROTECT THE AREA FARM WORKER HOUSING IS PROBLEMATIC IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M LIKE A DEVISING THE ADMINISTRATION TO ELECT LOOK AT THE CONNECTIVE ITTY BETWEEN JOBS AND LIVING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THOSE PEOPLE. I'M THE QUESTIONS I HAVE BOMB ARE RELATED- I'M GONNA JUST SAY THAT I AGREE WITH BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES AND- I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION I HAD IS WHETHER WE HAVE AN INDICATION BY GEOGRAPHIC. DISTRIBUTION WHERE A MAJORITY OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS- HERE TO FOUR HAVE BEEN GRANTED AND I'M SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES THAT THE L. A. O. RAISES WHICH IS- I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT JUST MAKING BIGGER GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT- THAT- OUR- HE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THE RESOURCES ARE ARE NOT- GOING TO BE IT GONNA GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND I'M- I'M CONCERNED WITH WHERE WE MAKE OUR INVESTMENTS OKAY DO YOU M. I. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE GEOGRAPHIC. DISTRIBUTION OF THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN THE PAST AND IF YOU COULD ALSO GIVE ME A DEFINITION OF HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY SO I CAN UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER HOW WE'RE IDENTIFYING IDENTIFYING THAT I'M WONDERING IF FOR USING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT OR UNDER EMPLOYMENT OR WAGES OR IF THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A DEFINITION ABOUT THAT THAT CAN HELP US GUIDE US IN THIS. AB SEVENTY SEVEN CLARIFIED THAT COULD THE GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE- KHALKHIN PIECE IS ISRAEL THERE HAS NOT BEEN A- GRANT PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY SO. AS FAR AS THE HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS THAT WILL- LEADER. GRANT GUIDELINES THAT WILL GIVE MORE DETAILS ON THAT. OVERALL I WILL DEFER TO MY- COLLEAGUE GOT MISTER SCOTT DOES BECAUSE FAR AS THEY- DID GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF- OF. TAX CREDITS PERHAPS IS. THAT THAT DIDN'T. HAPPEN SO FAR. AND AND AS FAR AS- THE DEFINITION. OF THE HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS. THE MANAGER THIS IS VADA SICK WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WITH GO BIZ IF I MAY. YES PLEASE THANK. THANK YOU- SO AS- AS ONE WOULD EXPECT I MEAN THERE HAS BEEN A WIDE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE OVER THOUSAND CAL COMPETES TAX CREDIT AGREEMENTS OVER THE SEVEN YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM HAS EXISTED- THAT- I WELL I DON'T HAVE THE- THAT PARTICULAR STATISTICS IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW. I'M CERTAINLY YES OF THE URBAN AREAS OF THE COASTAL URBAN AREAS HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE SEEN- MORE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE LARGER EMPLOYERS TEND TO BE- BUT AGAIN THAT IS ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS FOR. THE REQUEST FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM AND WITH THAT FOCUS ON THE- THE HIGH NEED HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS. THERE IS A RECOGNITION EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION THAT THE INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE. CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE FROM THE- FOR THE GREAT RECESSION AND IT'S NOT RECOVERY THE SAME WAY THAT OUR COASTAL AREAS WERE. AND SAID WELL CAL COMPUTER ALREADY HAS AN EXISTING PRIORITY FOR AREAS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND HIGH POVERTY. WE WANTED TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GRANT PROGRAM REALLY DID FOCUS ESPECIALLY ON INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CAN JUST RECESSION- YEAH WITH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT POVERTY RATES. AND LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- THAT IT ALSO SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAVE HAD- A NUMBER OF LARGE EMPLOYERS COMING TO IN THE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT INCLUDING THE LAST ROUND THAT WE HAD A COMPANY IN LODI. FEED THAT'S CREATING OVER TWO THOUSAND JOBS. IN MANUFACTURING OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT THAT'S USED TO TEST FOR COBIT AMONG OTHER THINGS. AND ONE THINGS WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THAT PROPOSALS NOT ONLY WAS IT BLUE COLLAR JOBS ENTRY LEVEL BLUE COLOR TOPPED WITH UPWARD MOBILITY. BUT IT WAS COMING TO LODI- WHICH IS IT EIGHT EIGHT TYPICAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA FOR INVESTMENT OF THIS KIND. VERY GOOD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES CENTER OCT THANK YOU MANAGER I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR I'M I'M NOT COMPLAINING IN FACT I JUST WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT- CALIFORNIA COMPETES THE GO BIZ OUR TEAM HAS DONE AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MEETING WITH THE CONSTITUENTS THAT I REPRESENT AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AND ACTUALLY SPENDING MORE TIME FRANKLY AND THE THIRTY FIRST SENATE DISTRICT I THINK THAT I SPEND IN THE THIRTY FIRST ST SENATE DISTRICT AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE NOTED AND THAT ACTIVITY AND THAT ACTION SHOULD BE COMMENDED. I JUST WANTED TO TRY TO POINT OUT WHAT I PERCEIVE TO BE THE DISCONNECT WE AND I'M NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE JOBS ARE INCENTIVIZED IN THE URBAN COASTAL AREAS BUT THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPT WE'RE SHOVING STATE MONEY DOWN TO INCENTIVIZE OTHER JOB EXPANSION IN EXISTING PLANTS OR RECRUITING. NEW BUSINESSES TO BRING NEW PLANTS TO THOSE AREAS BUT WE DON'T REQUIRE ANY OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CERTIFY THAT THEY HAVE THE HOUSING TO HOUSE THOSE WORKERS. AND WE SO THEY EXPAND AND THEN THERE'S ARENA A HOUSING ALLOWANCE. THE HOUSING IS AN ALLOCATED THEY DON'T HAVE A HOUSING OR THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT AND THEN ANOTHER ARM OF THE STATE SINCE THE THREATENING LETTER. AND TRIES TO SUE TO ENFORCE HOUSING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF WE PUT THE TWO TOGETHER. WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A COORDINATED POLICY APPROACH TO BOTH JOB EXPANSION. JOB RECRUITMENT. AND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IN ONE AREA SO WE HOUSE OF WORKERS CLOSE TO WHERE THEY LIVE WHICH IMPACTS THE MONEY WE HAVE TO PUT INTO PROJECTS AND THE LIKE SO. I'M JUST SUGGESTING A MORE COORDINATED APPROACH TO THIS BUT- THANK YOU KHALKHIN PETERSON THANK YOU GO BILLS FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR US IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH AND APPRECIATE PRESHEAF THOSE COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S- THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIP WE NEED WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOALS WHICH IS CREATING GOOD JOBS BUT ALSO HAVING HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR THE WORK FORCE. I APPRECIATE THAT. AND ON ON THIS MIGHT MY WHOLE ISSUE IS- IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS AND IN THE AREA THAT HAVE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. WHERE WE STRUGGLE TO- TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER SOME REALLY GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT THE- LOAD I PROPOSAL THAT'S- EXACTLY THE KIND OF INVESTMENT THAT I THINK. IS IS WORTH OUR OUR ENERGY AND- VALUABLE TAX RESOURCES AND SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. WITH US. I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH ALL OVER THE STATE INCLUDING AND IN RURAL AREAS AS WELL. SO ON THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN. WHICH IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE PROGRAMS. TWENTY BY THE DEPARTMENT CORRECT THIS IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT THEY WILL MAKE THE PRESENTATION. I CAME IN I'M SURE THIS IS SCOTT WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AYE BANK AND- I'M HAPPY TO. MAKE THE OPENING COMMENTS. REGARDING IT SO I WILL COVER BOTH THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUESTS FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. AS WELL AS A FIFTY MILLION REQUEST FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTERS CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FOLLOWING TEN OTHER INITIATIVES FOR UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES. SO FIRST ON THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR I BIG SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM THE PRINCIPAL pBUSINESS FINANCE CENTER BUT IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT- TO THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY. FISCAL YEAR BUDGET. FROM THE STATE THE PROGRAM LAST RECEIVED FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY ELEVEN. OH EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO REVOLVE CONSERVE OUR SINS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVING SUPPORTED OVER ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF LOANS. THE PROGRAM IS UTILIZED BY DIVERSE SPACE A SMALL BUSINESSES UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES WITH LARGER LOAN SIZES AVERAGING AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM IS APPROACHING FULL CAPACITY AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THE CURRENT FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS GUARANTEES WILL LIKELY BE FULLY LEVERAGED LATER THIS YEAR. ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUED LOAN ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT AND WILL BE LEVERAGED TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS. WELL THE BILL HAS BEEN REINTRODUCED TO RECAPITALIZE. THE FEDERAL STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT IS TO SERVE THE S. B. C. I. WITH TEN BILLION DOLLARS. SETTLED SEVERAL BILLS WERE INTRODUCED DURING THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR FOR BETWEEN THREE AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE NOT PASSED. WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL IS MORE LIKELY THIS TIME AROUND WE HAVE NO INSURANCE. ALSO EVEN OF SUCH FUNDING MATERIALIZES. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESS GUARANTEES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SS DCI GUARANTEES. FROM. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN A FULL 32% OF OUR LOAN GUARANTEES FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. WERE DONE BY STATE FUNDS VERSUS FEDERAL FUNDS. THE SECOND ITEM IS THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUNDING AND INITIATIVES FOR UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES. THE BUDGET PROVIDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR AYE BANKS SMALL BUSINESSMAN CENTER. THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER MANAGES SMALL BUSINESS LOAN DISASTER LOAN GUARANTEES PRIMATECH GUARANTEES DIRECTLY IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JUMPSTART A STARTUP LOANS IN ADDITION IT CAN QUICKLY ADD NEW PROGRAMS TO JUST TO IMMEDIATE MARKET NEEDS AS IT DID LAST APRIL WITH THE LAUNCH WITHIN DAYS OF THE COVER NINETEEN MARK LOAN GUARANTEES. THOSE LOANS. FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE'RE FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE ON AVERAGE FIVE EMPLOYEES. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED BY THE MOST UNDERSERVED AND THE SMALLEST A SMALL BUSINESSES IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LONG TERM RECOVERY A CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AS THE ANCHOR INVESTMENT TO HELP CREATE THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUNDS. INTENDED TO AGGREGATE FUNDING FROM PUBLIC PRIVATE AND PHILANTHROPIC SOURCES TO ADDRESS THE COUPLE NEEDS A SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY REOPEN AND RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF COVER NINETEEN. THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FONG IS INTENDED TO SERVE. LIKEWISE TO OUR CURRENT PROGRAM THE SMALLEST AND MOST UNDERSERVED A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAKE UP AN ESSENTIAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. RECENT STATE COMMITMENTS TOTALING THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH INCLUDES THE ADDITIONAL TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND ANNOUNCED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH. THE FUND IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF LENDING CAPITAL AS IT PURSUES ITS GOAL OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION IS INTENDED FOR. THE CALIFORNIA REVEALING FUND IN ACROSS I THINK SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES THAT ALSO TARGET UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES. SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND NEW SOLUTIONS ARE BEING TREATED TO DRESS THIS MASSIVE FUNDING GAP IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RETAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT SUCH FUNDS AND JUST TO FINANCIAL OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OR TOOLS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BETTER ASSIST UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES AS CONDITIONS EVOLVE AND YOU FUNDING GAPS ARISE. INCLUDING ENSURE COMING NINETEEN GUARANTEES OR ANY NEW VEHICLE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA WE DON'T IN FACT. WE INTEND TO FOLLOW LL'S RECOMMENDATION TO NOTIFY THE JAIL BC IF FUNDS ARE DIRECTED TO COUPLE SYSTEMS PROGRAMS TO UNDERSERVED SMALL BUSINESSES OTHER THAN BY THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FONG. WITHOUT I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THANK YOU. APARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. NO WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YES BRIAN WEATHERFORD AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM HAS MERIT. AND IMPROVING BUSINESS ACCESS TO CAPITAL- THROUGH THE SMALL AT THE S. S. B. C. I. PROGRAM WHICH IS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT FEDERAL STATE LOAN PROGRAMS- THIS IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER OR WHILE MANY BUSINESSES. ESPECIALLY SMALL AND UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY ACCESSING CAPITAL DURING THIS TIME I'M IS MISTER WOULD MENTIONED THERE MAY BE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND WELL THAT WOULD BE IDEAL- IT MAY ALSO BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T- AS- TO ALSO MENTION WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE- LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY THAT- I THINK IT'S REQUESTED REGARDING THE- SECOND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- HOWEVER WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE- ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO SOME- REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU. BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH- PROVIDING THAT DELEGATION- BUT WE DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO- TO ASK QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT. AND AND THAT YOU'RE CONFIDENT THE ANSWERS THAT YOU'RE GETTING FROM THE MINISTRATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIRTY NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE FLEXIBILITY REQUESTED BY FINANCE IS OF SOME CONCERN TO ME. THE REASON IS. IN THE MACRO SENSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS CEDED TOO MUCH OF ITS AUTHORITY. TO THE ADMINISTRATION. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT FINANCE INDICATES THAT THEY EMBRACE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THAT COULD BE COUNTER TO WHAT THE LEGISLATORS FEEL IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THEIR PRIORITY. SO MYSUGGESTION IN A SINGLE AREA IS THAT WOULD YOU BE A LITTLE PRO SCRIPTED. OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE I BACK FUNDING GO TO. AND NOT BE AS GENEROUS TO FINANCE WITH THE FLEXIBILITY. OBSERVATION MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NIELSEN MY ONLY COMMENT IN REGARDS TO THE MICRO BROWN SAYS THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT- THE MICRO BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN DEVASTATED AS MUCH AS THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY MANY OF THESE ARE- SELF EMPLOYED SINGLE UNDER ENTREPRENEURS THAT. HAVE LOST ALL THEIR CAPITAL IN THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A REAL NEED TO CREATE CREATE FOR A FUND SO THAT THEY CAN START BACK UP AND- REALLY TO CAPITALIZE WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND- I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AS MUCH AS A NEED FOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO. HAVING SAID THAT I AGREE WITH SENATOR NIELSEN IN REGARDS TO THE- THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO REINVEST DOLLARS THAT THAT MAY NOT NEED TO BE SPENT BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY THE LEAD TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A DISCUSSION ON ON HOW WE CAN CREATE THE LANGUAGE SO THAT- THE RESOURCES CAN BE USED IN A WAY THAT IS- BENEFICIAL AND I. THAT THE MORE THAT WE CAN PUSH MONEY TO THE LOCAL CD ADVISE I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE PEOPLE ON THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT UNDERSTAND WITH THE NEEDS OF THE MICRO BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS AND FOR MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY CAESAR. BUSINESSES THAT ARE STARTED BY BY IMMIGRANTS WHO COME OVER AND WANT TO BE THEIR OWN BUSINESS PEOPLE BUT OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS ABOUT STARTING A BUSINESS ARE ARE PRETTY COMPLICATED SO THEY START SMALL AND THEY AND THEY BUILD FROM THAT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE RESOURCES FOR THEM SO- THIS IS A HOLDOVER ITEMS SO. THAT EXPECTANCY IT BACK FOR A VOTED AT A LATER DATE SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FUND AND I WANT TO INVITE INVITE EITHER THE DEPARTMENT. OR THE DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE TO PRESENT THIS.

BLURS IN GROSS. NATIONWIDE THREE TIMES OUR ACTUAL OUTPUT ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR TRILLION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE.

SOME OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH IN ON THE ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO- TO WRITE SPECIFICITY AND- PERHAPS REQUIRE SOME REPORTING OR OTHER OVERSIGHT MEASURES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTUALLY AS A FOOTNOTE WHAT I SAID THE LAST TIME ON THE LAST ITEM REALLY RELATES TO THIS ONE.

AND AND THAT WOULD BE AGAIN PUBLICLY DISCLOSED TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT. LASTLY THE SHE PROGRAM RECEIVED FUNDING AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND NOW THIS APPEARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE THAT SHE PROGRAM. THAT'S ONLY ONE YEAR LATER. FAIL AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEING REPLACED OR WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON TO NOT CONTINUE WITH A STATE PROGRAM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR. AGAIN I THINK THAT'S THE FINANCE. THE STATE PROGRAM FROM LAST YEAR. I WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT AND GET BACK TO SENATOR I BELIEVE THAT PROGRAM LAST YEAR WAS ONLY FOR A YEAR- BUT I WILL DOUBLE CHECK THAT. THANK YOU.

AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING SOMETHING WHICH PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM- FOR EXAMPLE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE COULD BE ADDED TO REQUIRE- REPORTING TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE IN DRIVING INNOVATION INCREASING OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED BUSINESS GROUPS. SO AND THIS WAS RELATED I THINK TO THE DREAM GRANTS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST ITEM THERE ARE THE REPORTING BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS BUT THEY OFTEN FOCUS ON. THE NUMBER OF TRAININGS PROVIDED AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THAT TRAINING BUT NOT NECESSARILY- OUTCOMES IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACKING YET IT'S AROUND WHAT SEEMS TO BE ON THE IMPORTANT OUTCOME IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMMENTS THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR NIELSEN. THE BOSTON GLOBE HAS OF. DO YOU HAVE A QUANTIFICATION OF HOW MUCH. I THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN LEVERAGED BY THE SAYING WE ALL TALK ABOUT THE LEVERAGING- CAN YOU A CERTAIN HOW MUCH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE. ANY DOLLAR AMOUNT SIR. AT MARCH NINTH NOT MANAGED CARE AND SENATOR NIELSEN I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS ON THAT AND TYPICALLY THESE TYPES OF INCUBATORS- RELY ON PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGAIN THERE IT REAP REGIONALLY BASED IT RELY PARTNERSHIPS WITH REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DOING RESEARCH- THERE THEY RELY ON PHILANTHROPY TO SOME EXTENT AND YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF TIES INTO. MISTER WEATHERFORD'S COMMENTS IN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS NOT IS IN IN THE ITS INITIAL ITERATION OF THE I HAVE PROGRAM THERE WAS NO FINANCIAL COMPONENT THERE WAS NO GRANT COMPONENT WHATSOEVER AND SO- SO THIS IS A UNIQUE ASPECT TO HELP THE NEEDY ENTITIES HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING PARTICULARLY IN A TIME POST COLD ED WHERE- YOU KNOW IT DOES TIONAL REVENUES ARE SCARCE TO CONTINUE FOCUSING ON THAT EACH INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR INNOVATION AND- AND START UPS. HERE ARE I PER THE AD AND I COMMEND YOUR- IF I LIKE YOUR CHOICE OF BIRCH. BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE ANSWER THE QUANTIFICATION. ANSWER THAT'S IT'S A GENERALIZATION AND IT'S A SORT OF DIRECTORY. BUT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY JOBS ARE CREATED FOR EXAMPLE DO WE HAVE ANY HARD FACTS AND DATA ON THE NUMBER OF JOBS CREATED BY THIS INVESTMENT. SENATE AT MADAM CHAIR CENTER NIELSEN I BELIEVE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO WANT TO TRACK OUT OF THIS PROGRAM IN STATUTE FOR THE EXISTING I HOPE PROGRAM WE DID IT WE DO HAVE A MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- AND AGAIN THERE IS JUST. NOT A LOT TO REPORT OTHER THAN IT WAS A PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ON PARTNERSHIPS AND HELPING. HELPING THESE LOCAL I. HOBBS- YOU KNOW IN ACCESS TO VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES OR WORKING WITH THEM ON THE BENCH IT WAS IT WAS MERELY A PARTNERSHIP. THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO TAKE THE PROGRAM AND TO FIND OUT QUANTITATIVELY WHITE WILL BE. WHAT THE PRODUCT OF THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BE SO THAT IS. CERTAINLY IN OUR PLANS TO EXAMINE- BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY CASE STUDIES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE IT BEFORE. WELL I'M GONNA. THAT YOU DO GET ABOUT THAT THE GENERAL ALLERGIES AND THE HOPES ARE CERTAINLY APPLICABLE. BUT THE HARD DATA IS ALSO REQUIRED AND WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THAT- B. DEVELOP ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE WHAT AREAS ARE WE SERVING. WITH THESE FUNDS. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEAS WHAT AREAS SERVED AND OR WHAT INDUSTRIES PARTICULARLY ARE RECEIVING THE FUNDING COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT OR IS THAT AN ERROR YEAR YET EXPLORING. BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR NIELSEN- YES SO TYPICALLY THE HUBS THAT WE HAD IN OUR FIRST I HAVE PROGRAM AT THE ART GEOGRAPHICALLY FOCUSED ALL OVER THE STATE- AND THEY AGAIN HAVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH VARIOUS STATE AND- START WITH VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHETHER ITS CITY HALL THEIR LOCAL CHAMBERS- OR RATHER THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS. AND TYPICALLY THEY DO HAVE AN INDUSTRY FOCUS SO- THAT'S KIND OF THE NEAT THING ABOUT IT THERE MAYBE ONE- HI IN INCUBATOR THAT'S LET'S SAY- LET'S SAY IN I DON'T KNOW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SUMMER BAY AREA THEY MAY HAVE A FOCUS ON BIOTECHNOLOGY THERE MAY BE ANOTHER ONE THAT HAS A FOCUS ON. ON CLIMATE RESIIENCE OR- YOU KNOW BIOMASS SO A LOT OF THEM DO HAVE THIS INDUSTRY FOCUSED SOME OF THEM ARE A MIX BUT TYPICALLY IT'S A MIX OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRY HOW WE HAVE WORKED. TOGETHER WITH THEM BUT YOU KNOW OUR FOCUS FOR ITEM SQUARED IS GOING TO BE TO LOOK AT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE INLAND PART OF THE STATE AGAIN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDERSERVED THROUGH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE. MORE AVAILABLE BUDGET OTHER INNOVATE IN INCUBATOR IN IN THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YES IT DOES LET ME JUST ELABORATE A BIT AND BY THE WAY IN LANDED. CALIFORNIA TO MEET EXTENDS. OF THE TACHE APPEASE ALL UP TO SISKIYOU IN DEL MAR WILL NOT DON'T DE MAY BUT JUST. COUNTY AND- A IN THE NEW. PART OF THE STATE- THE DIE CALL THAT IN LAND AND IT SHOWED DO NOT NEGLECT THOSE AREAS AND I DID APPRECIATE YOUR REFERENCE TO BIO MASS THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE HAVE SEVERELY NEGLECTED. FOR DECADES AND THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED. IN NO SMALL MEASURE TO THE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. SO YOU'RE ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES IT WOULD BE MAY BE HELPFUL TO US AND CLEANING UP THE FOREST IN THE WILDLANDS AND PROTECTING. FOR THE FUTURE. OUR FIFTY THAT DOES MY LIFE MAINTAIN ON THIS IS MUCH. TRY TO DO FOR. MORE NUMBERS CRUNCHING AS SO WE CAN ASSESS WITH WORKING IS A THREE HELPING EVENT MUST ADMIT- I SIT HERE IN THE LONG HOURS AND COMMITTEE AND WE AND ENTERTAIN IDEAS. BUT SELDOM BOOKS DO OUR OFFICES EVER GET CALLS FROM THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE BENEFICIARY SINGLE THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER OR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THANKING US THAT THIS IS REALLY WORKING- AS YOUR. DOUBLING UP THE MONEY IT MIGHT BE WELL TO ENCOURAGE THEM NAY THAT LOCAL RECIPIENT INDUSTRY INDIVIDUAL OR GOVERNMENT ENTITY. THE CONTACT THEIR LEGISLATORS AND LET HIM KNOW HOW THIS IS WORKING. INFORMATION IN THE VOID FOR US IS. NOT BENEFICIAL- THAT'S JUST AN ENCOURAGEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON- THE I GUESS THE TICKET TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AT THE CENTER NIELSEN ASKED IS. DO DO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS THESE INNOVATION HUBS BUT WITH NO CURRENT NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO IN I GUESS I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD NUMBER TWO IS. THIS ADDS THE GRANT PORTION TO IT AND- IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT IT WILL BE. EIGHT COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. AND TEN GRANTS WILL BE AWARDED OR ARE THERE TEN HAVE SET UP IN YOU KNOW-WHERE THEY ARE AND THESE TEN HUBS WOULD WOULD BE THE RECIPIENTS OF THE OF THE GRANT. MADAM CHAIR ASSUMING THAT QUESTION IS FOR ME. YES OKAY THANK YOU YES SO THE INITIAL I HAVE PROGRAM WHAT IS IT INDEED THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE IT WAS MERELY A PARTNERSHIP WE HAD ESTABLISHED AND- USE THAT HAVE SINCE EXPIRED- AND WE CERTAINLY ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY AYE HOMES ARE AROUND THE STATE OF MORE THAN TEN I BELIEVE LESS THAN TWENTY WAS WHAT WE HAD TO FORMULATE A FORMER. FORMALLY ESTABLISH ANIMAL USE WET- BUT THIS WOULD BE AT A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THE ON THE I HAVE THE INCUBATORS THAT ARE OUT THERE WOULD. PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO AN RFP AND- AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE THEY WOULD DESCRIBE HOW THEY WOULD BE LEVERAGING THE GRANT FUNDING AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE AND HOW THEY WOULD SERVE. THAT NEED UNDERSERVED ME THE TARGET COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH HERE. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- THAT WAS EXCELLENT THAT THAT SOLVES I THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. AS WE READ THIS ISSUE- QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW SUCCESSFUL WAS THE REGIONAL PROGRAM AND- HOW IS THIS GOING TO. MAKE THE PROGRAM MORE EFFECTIVE FOR A AND HOW DO WE EVALUATE WHETHER IT'S MORE MORE EFFECTIVE AND- YOUR ANSWER EXPLAINS THAT I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. THIS IS A- HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL DO THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT AGAIN WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN. WHICH IS THE CAL OS BA OUT REACH AND ENGAGEMENT. AND I BELIEVE- ON. THE BASIS GOING TO PRESENT THAT AS WELL. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AGAIN THIS IS A REQUEST FOR- THE AUTHORITY OVER NINE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO PERMANENTLY ESTABLISH AUTHORITY OF SIX POSITIONS AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE TO PROVIDE THE EXTENSIVE AND SCALABLE DIRECT SUPPORT TO SMALL BUSINESSES NEEDED IN THIS NEW MULTI DISASTER ENVIRONMENT- I KNOW THAT I HAVE WORKED WITH ALL OF YOU IN YOUR OFFICE IS SIGNIFICANTLY- AND MORE SO PROBABLY EXPONENTIALLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON THAT YOU KNOW AS- THIS IS. A FOCUS ON THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY INCREASES AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THROUGH THIS EXPANSION OF AN AND MOREOVER I THINK COVE IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL CAPACITY IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT EXISTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO GET SMALL BUSINESSES- YOU KNOW ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED TO BE. COMPETITIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT SO THIS TEAM WOULD FOCUS ON CONDUCTING THE REQUIRED DIRECT SUPPORT OUT REACHING GAUGE RENDON MARKETING CONTENT NECESSARY NECESSARY INCREASINGLY ONLINE TO CONNECT WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND HELP THEM BE PREPARING BE MORE RESILIENT PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT IN. DISASTER IMPACTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE TEAM STRATEGIES WOULD BE DR BY EQUITY MEASURE AND WILL PRIOR PRIORITY UNDERS THE BUSINESS GROUPS INCLUDING WOMEN MINORITIES VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES IN LOW WEALTH ROLE IN DISASTER IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. OF THE DIRECT BUSINESS SUPPORT AND AN INCLUSIVE OUR REGION GAGE NINETEEN WOULD FOCUS ON INCREASING CONNECTION IN SUPPORT OF SMALL BUSINESSES FOR GREATER EQUITY RESILIENCE AND SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. BY IT WITH A PRIORITY ON REACHING THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND- I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER REALLY INTERESTING DATA POINT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU I YES JUST FOR CONTEXT SO. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT CALLAWAY C. A. OFFICE RECEIVED LESS THAN A HUNDRED REQUEST FOR JURY GENERAL DIRECT SUPPORT- END IN DISASTER AREAS WHETHER IT'S FIRES OR SOMETHING ELSE. THAT NUMBER INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY AND CALLOW S. B. A. WORKS WITH- HELLO YES TO PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT FUNCTION FOR THE STATE WHICH FOCUSES ALMOST ENTIRELY ON SMALL BUSINESSES- AGAIN FOR CONTEXT SINCE MARCH FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. HELLO SB RECEIVED ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND REQUESTS FOR DIRECT SUPPORT AND RESPONSE I KNOW THAT MANY ELECTED OFFICIALS OFFICES- CALL US AND EMAIL ME AND SAY- HEY MARIO CAN WE GET A SPEAKER FROM YOUR OFFICE TO COME AND TALK TO OUR ROUND TABLES. AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY IN THIS THIS IS THE EXACT TYPE OF THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WE'RE TRYING TO BE MORE AVAILABLE HERE CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE STATE. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT THE SUPPORT THAT THEY RECEIVE AND- WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD APPROVE THIS BUDGET ITEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVOLVE YOU WITH OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS THANK YOU FOR THAT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. JERVIS NOTHING ADD THANK YOU MORAL THANK YOU MUCH LET'S ANALYSTS ON. WELL WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS ITEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. TURN THE OVEN. HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT THE SIX NEW POSITIONS WILL IN FACT BE DOING WHAT YOU SUGGEST THAT'S GOING OUT IN THE HINTERLANDS AND BEING IN TOUCH. ARE THEY GOING OVER THERE THE JOB CLASSIFICATION WOULD REQUIRE THAT OR HOW DO WE BE SURE THAT THIS JUST ISN'T A P. Y. BUILDER FOR AN AGENCY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATOR NIELSEN FOR THAT QUESTION- YOU ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH GO BIZ WE'RE HISTORICALLY BEEN AT A VERY SMALL- YET NIMBLE AND- HOPEFULLY PRODUCTIVE AGENCY FOR THE STATE AND- WE DO HAVE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN ANNUAL REPORT WHERE WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRACKING THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS ENGAGEMENTS. THE OUTGOING- EVENTS THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN ALL OF THIS IS REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE ANNUALLY IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT BUT MOREOVER WE DO THINK IT'S A PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND IN SHARING OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS ON OUR OFFICE AND HOW WE'RE SERVING THE PUBLIC. WELL THIS IS KIND OF A MINUSCULE AREA. BUT I MUST CONFESS IT'S AN AREA I'M PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IN THE BUDGET. HERE AND THERE AND HERE AND THERE. THESE ARE SMALL AMOUNTS MAYBE BUT THEY ARE ALSO. BUDGET BUSTERS THEY INFLATE THE BASE BUDGET AND AS I'M LOOKING AT EXPENDITURES THEN I'M ALWAYS WORK MINDFUL OF WHAT'S THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ALL THIS JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE HERE A LITTLE BIT MORE HEIR IT TURNS OUT BEING A LOT MORE OVER MANY MANY YEARS SO WE DO HAVE TO BE IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY I'M KIND OF- BASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WHAT WE WILL DO THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY. AND IT'S ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN THE SALES TAX EXCLUSION. IF WE COULD HEAR FROM THE- DEPARTMENT. HELLO THIS IS J. COMPARTMENT APARTMENT IN FINANCE- SO THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY WAS HOUSED IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND OPERATES A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FIRMS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES INTENDED TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND CONSERVE ENERGY ARE ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IS A SALES TAX EXEMPTION WHICH IS AWARDED THROUGH AN APPLICATION PROCESS I'M INCIDENT INTENDED TO SPSS MANUFACTURERS IN PURCHASING CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR HOUSTON ALTERNATIVES ALTERNATIVE SOURCE ENERGY PRODUCTION. IN FRANCE MANUFACTURING ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MANUFACTURING THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ENCOURAGE STREET REEN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TO TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA BRINGING WITH IT BENEFITS SUCH AS JOB CREATION POLLUTION REDUCTION- THE SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS ARE WARDED TO APPLICANTS BASED ON A NET BENEFIT TEST OUTLINED IN THE PROGRAM'S REGULATIONS WHICH SCORES PROSPECTIVE PROJECTS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL IMPACT. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. LOCAL UNEMPLOYED AND PLACE FOR THE PRIME WILL BE LOW. AND ARE ALSO OUR LOCAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT- SO THAT'S NUMBER OF JOBS SCRIPTED AMONGST OUR ALONG WITH SOME OTHER THINGS- THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY CAPPED AT A HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL EXEMPTIONS AVAILABLE TO BE AWARDED PER YEAR AND THIS CAP HAS BEEN REACHED EVERY YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALENDAR YEAR SO I IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME. DOUBLING THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE IN THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION. I FURTHERMORE IF ANY AMOUNT OF THAT EXTRA HUNDRED MILLION IS LEFT I THINK ALLOCATED. IN THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WOULD BE ROLLED OVER AND AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE EXTENSION PROPOSAL IS A RECOGNITION AND RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER TAX RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES TO COVER NINETEEN DEMING- AND THE POTENTIAL MAGNIFICATION EFFECT ADDITIONAL-AID FOR THESE IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES COULD HAPPEN THIS CURRENT MOMENT. WHEN BUSINESSES MAY BE RECALIBRATING AND MAKING NEW LONG TERM INVESTMENT PLANS. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS- I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS I ALSO SOME COLLEAGUES. I'M ON THE CALL FROM THE AUTHORITY WHO MIGHT BE BETTER FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT ARE AIMED AT THOSE SPECIFIC ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. I THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE. THANK YOU. SAID CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN GENERAL WE WOULD DISCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE FROM USING LOCAL REVENUES TO FIND STATE PROGRAMS WE ESTIMATE THAT. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD IN FACT BE BORNE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSAL'S BENEFITS WOULD BE NEITHER TIMELY NOR DIRECTED TOWARDS THE- BUSINESSES HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO EXERCISE. THEIR OWN JUDGMENT REGARDING THE BEST USE OF THESE REVENUES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SATURDAY IS. THIS NOT THEN. SEPARATE CHARACTERIZES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. SENATOR NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I AM NOT OUR OFFICES- EXPERT ON MANDATES- SO I WOULD NEED TO- TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I DON'T SEE I THINK THE ANSWER IS PROBABLY NO BUT- WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT PLEASE DO I'M SENSITIVE TO THOSE UNFUNDED MANDATES- THEY THEY HAVE A LONG HISTORY AROUND HERE. WELL I'M I'M GONNA JUMP ON THIS BANDWAGON MY CONCERN IS THAT. THE STATE'S IN A VERY UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL POSITION THAT. WHILE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF. ONE OF THE BIGGEST DOWNTURN IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY. DOT COM BETTER REVENUES UP. AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS I UNDERSTAND IT- LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME REALLY TOUGH DECISIONS. ABOUT WHAT SERVICES THEY WILL KEEP AND WHAT SERVICES THEY WILL CUT AND FOR US TO ADD TO THAT. GRIEF AS A- ME JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A HOLLOW OPEN ITEM I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I UNDERSTAND- HOW THIS WILL WORK AND I APPRECIATE. THE INFORMATION THAT IS GIVEN I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT. WHERE THIS TAX CREDIT HAS BENEFITED OR WHAT COMMUNITIES IT'S BENEFITTED THE MOST AND WHAT KIND OF INDUSTRIES IT'S BENEFITTED. THE MOST AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S- IT'S ALL OVER THE BOARD IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF INDUSTRIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS THIS KIND OF TAX CREDIT. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT- WE ARE ASKING LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE BIGGEST HAIR CUT AND I AM I'M A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT I MIGHT NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THEY- WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT I THINK I KNOW. BUT I APPRECIATE IT THIS COMING FORWARD- I. IF I WAS GOING TO CONSIDER IT- I THINK THE PROPOSAL WOULD NEED TO TARGET TARGET THE HARDEST HIT BUSINESSES IN ORDER FOR ME TO FEEL LIKE THERE'S A REAL. A REAL REASON TO- TO MAKE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE- AT THE TAX CREDIT SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. ISSUE WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN.

VERY GOOD A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I DO HAVE ONE ONE CONCERN AND- AND- IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT TO BE NOTED FOR THE FUTURE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN I ITEM SO WHAT WE WILL BE HOLDING IT OPEN BUT- THE ESTIMATE OUR DAD WAS PREPARED IN REGARDS TO- THAT DEBT COLLECTOR COLLECTOR LICENSING AND REGULATION- I HAD A RANGE AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS PARTICULAR ROPOSAL IS AT THE HIGHEST THAT THE HIGHER END OF THE- OF THE OF THE RANGE. AND WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT SETTING UP AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAT THERE AREN'T THE LICENSEES TO SUPPORT IT SO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW MANY LICENSES LICENSEES WE ARE PROJECTING AND THAT THAT WORK WORK PLAN AND PRODUCT. OF MEAT THAT LICENSING SO I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME BUT I DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT MAYBE THE L. A. O. CAN LOOK AT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL CAREFULLY AND GIVE US SOME DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE. SO- SIGNAL QUESTIONSTHIS IS A HOLLOW OPEN ITEM SO WE'LL MOVE ON. TO THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS DIFFERENT IT'S AN ITEM OF THE FRANCHISE. TAX BOARD. THE MAIN STREET BUSINESS TAX CREDIT. HI THIS IS A COPY WHITE AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND STUFF I'LL BE PRESENTING THIS ISSUE. SO LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SB FOURTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH CREATED THE MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESS HIRING CREDIT. THIS CREDIT WAS AIMED AT HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN HURT BY THE PANDEMIC AND TO ENCOURAGE SUCH BUSINESSES TO HIRE EMPLOYEES IN THE SECOND HALF OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE CREDIT WAS MODELED AFTER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT WHICH WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE CABINET CARE ACT-CARES ACT. THE CREDIT WAS EQUAL TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES HIRED BETWEEN JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND DECEMBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOR QUALIFIED EMPLOYERS. A QUALIFIED EMPLOYER ANY EMPLOYER WHO HAD FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN ANYWAY GROSS RECEIPTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TWENTY TWENTY. OR 50% OR LESS THAN THEIR GROSS RECEIPTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO THEY HAD TO BE RELATIVELY SMALL AND SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC THE CREDIT WAS ALLOCATED A CAPTAIN ONE HUNDRED MILLION. THE RESERVATION PUREED ENDED ON JANUARY FIFTEENTH AND ONLY ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION CREDITS WERE RESERVED. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO EXPAND THIS CREDIT SIMILAR TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID INTO THE U. S. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION CREDIT AS PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH WAS ENACTED IN DECEMBER BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A DETAILED PROPOSAL THIS TIME BUT THE OUTLINE OF A PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD FOR THE CREDIT. AND LOOSEN THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA AS NEEDED TO MAKE CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY FOR TAXPAYERS TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT. YEAH KIDDING CREDIT AMOUNT IS ONE HUNDRED MILLION PLUS WHATEVER MONSTER LEFT OVER FROM THE FIRST ROUND OF CREDITS IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE RESERVATION CARRY FOR THE THAT'S WHAT THE EARLY IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. EXTENSION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FOR ARMS HURT BY THE PANDEMIC. AND ENCOURAGE THOSE FIRMS TO HIRE WORKERS. WORKERS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. JUSTIN GROSSI FROM THE OHIO. WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL- HAS A LOT OF MERIT- AMONG THE PROPOSALS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT IS PART OF THE PACKAGE WE THINK THIS ONE IS THE MOST TARGETED TO THE HARDEST HIT FIRMS THE FIRM. HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC WE ALSO LIKE THE COMPLIMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES INSTEAD OF DUPLICATING IT IN FACT WE WOULD RECOMMEND EXPANDING THIS PROPOSAL POSSIBLY BY INCREASING THE CREDIT AMOUNT- SO YOU FROM ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY NET NEW EMPLOYEE THEY CREATED SOMETHING ABOVE THAT AMOUNT. ANOTHER THING THAT NAY- YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS MAKING SOME NEW FIRMS IN THE HARDEST. HIT SECTORS ELIGIBLE BECAUSE- UNDER THE- THE NEW FEDERAL- UGH RULE IT IS- OKAY RIGHT THEIR OWN THE WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIRMS THAT- WERE CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY OR ELIGIBLE BUT THERE'S NOTHING YET IN THEIR FOR FIRMS THAT WERE JUST CREATED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE THINK THAT. LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE MAYBE PROVIDING SOME SORT OF CREDITS FOR NEW FIRMS IN THE HARDEST HIT SECTORS WHICH CAN BE DETERMINED BY THEIR SELF REPORTED A- CLASSIFICATION UNDER THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM NOT WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES WITH THIS THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKED OUT WE THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH SORT OF LOOKING INTO THAT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SINGMAN I LIKE THOSE A THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE L. A. O. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO ENCOURAGE US. TO EXPAND AND TO- YEAH TO EXPAND THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE COME UP IN AND OUT- I WORK WELL WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS SO I'M WONDERING COURAGE THAT IN. TWENTY I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THIS IS BEEN A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL THIS IS A COLD OPEN ITEMS SO EXPECT TO SEE THIS BACK AGAIN AND SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN. WHICH IS THE LAST ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR TODAY WHICH IS THE ELECTIVE S. CORPORATION TAX. AND AFTER THIS ONE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS AT THIS. SINCE GO AHEAD I CALLED THE WHITE AGAIN WITH THE FINANCE DO YOU LIKE THE BEST COURT ISSUE- THIS IS THAT THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. CAPTAIN MATT DEDUCTIBLES STATE AND LOCAL TAXES FOR INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ITEMIZED DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES OR REFER TO ASSAULT. PAID IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER RETURN AS A RESULT TAXPAYERS THE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THAT EXCEED THE CAP. AMOUNT LOSE A DEDUCTION OF THE EXCESS AMOUNT HOWEVER THE SALT CAP DOES NOT APPLY TO BUSINESS ENTITIES- FOR TAX YEARS TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE MINISTRATION PROPOES. TO ALLOW S. CORPORATIONS TO ELECT TO PAY A TAX AT A RATE OF THIRTEEN POINT 3% ON ITS NET INCOME FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW A CREDIT AGAINST THE TAX FOR INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDER IN THE S. CORPORATION IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THIRTEEN POINT 3% OF THE QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTION. THIS EFFECTIVELY SHIFT STATE TAXES ON S. CORPORATION INCOME FROM THE INDIVIDUAL OWNER BACK TO THE ESCORT BACK TO THE S. CORPORATION. I WAS ALWAYS A TO HELP CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND S. CORPORATIONS MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE SALT DEDUCTION AND INCREASE THEIR FEDERAL AFTER TAX INCOME AT NO TAX TO THE STATE. AS THE PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO BE ROUGHLY REVENUE NEUTRAL THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ALONG WITH MY OTHER COLLEAGUE SAID THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. JUSTIN ROSE SEE AGAIN OKAY WE OKAY OUR OFFICE FOR A pSUPPORTIVE OF ATTEMPTS TO- LEVERAGES FEDERAL FUNDING THIS PROPOSAL REALLY FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY WE DO HAVE- IF YOU CONCERNS MOSTLY WITH THE- SOME. WERE ALL AROUND UNCERTAINTY AT THE FEDERAL AND- FOR ONE THIS IS THE RULING THAT CLARIFY DID THEY INTEND TO DO EXEMPTS FROM. NET LEVEL TAXES FROM THE SOUL WHEN IT WAS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION IN DC WE IT ISN'T CLEAR YET WHETHER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO CONTINUE ALONG. YOU KNOW WITH THAT INTERPRETATION WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY SO. WE THINK IT'S IT MAY BE WORTH HOLDING OFF UNTIL YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF HOW THE NEW ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO PROCEED WITH THIS. THE SECOND ONE IS THAT A- CONTROL CONGRESS IS ALSO CHANGED HANDS IS GONE FROM SPLIT CONTROLS OF ONE PRTY CONTROL AND SO WE DON'T YET KNOW. WHETHER THE NEW CONGRESS MIGHT WANT TO DECIDE THEY WANT TO HANDLE THE SALT DEDUCTION DIFFERENTLY FROM THE WAY IT'S HANDLED UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LAW AND AGAIN I MEAN THAT THAT'LL BE AN OPEN ISSUE WAS IT COULDN'T REMAIN OPEN ISSUE FOR A LONG LONG TIME ON THE OTHER HAND WE MIX OF A BETTER IDEA IN A FEW MONTHS OF HOW. YOU KNOW HOW THEY SEEM TO WANT TO PROCEED ON THAT OKAY SO APART FROM THAT- WE THINK- IT. THIS CREDIT BE CAN. SORT OF IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT BENEFITS TO FILERS AT DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS. AND TO SAY- SORT OF SHARE THE BENEFIT BETWEEN THE- THE STATE AND BETWEEN- TAXPAYERS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO. TAKE SOME TIME TO DECIDE EXACTLY HOW SORT OF HOW THEY WANT TO HANDLE THIS ASSUMING THEY WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. FEDERAL BACKBENCHER WHAT AT SOME POINT THERE HAS TO BE SOME FINALITY TO THIS ISSUE RIGHT I MEAN I REALIZE WE'VE CHANGED ADMINISTRATIONS. SO AT WHAT POINT WOULD THIS COMMITTEE OR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE- US OF CHAPTER OF MEANNESS S. CORPORATION TAX ADJUSTMENT. WE'VE GOT THIS TAX YEAR WE'VE GOT NEXT TAX YEAR. WHO WANTS TO TAKE THAT ONE. I'LL I'LL RESPOND TO THAT THIS CALL THE LIGHT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN THIS THIS SAYS THIS TAX CHANGE TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEAR SO WELL- WE- WILL BE- YOU KNOW COMPANIES WOULD MAKE GOOD WOULD ELECTED. TO ELECTED TO HAVE THIS TAX APPLIED DURING THAT DURING THAT YEAR. AND THEN THEY WOULD FILE THEIR TAX RETURNS IN THAT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEAR. SO THIS DECISION COULD BE MADE IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO. I DON'T I DON'T THINK DECISION CAN BE MADE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO LET YOU HAVE TO LIKE TO HAVE THE TAX APPLIED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEAR AND RATHER THAN- YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO RETROACTIVELY. DO YOU APPLY TAX IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEAR- SO YOU'RE YOU'RE THIS PARTICULAR S. CORPORATION ELECTION HAS TO BE MADE IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY ONE. YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT I'M JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT THE- L. A.

CAL NONPROFITS OF A POLICY ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND ORGANIZATIONS AND THE VOICE OF. CALIFORNIANS NONPROFIT COMMUNITY. WE ARE A CONTRACTED APPLICATION PARTNER FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANTS PROGRAM AND ARE GLAD TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT NONPROFITS APPLYING FOR THESE GRANTS. IN PREVIOUS TESTIMONY WE DESCRIBE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT NONPROFIT BASED IN APPLYING FOR THESE GRANTS. WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WAYS TO HELP ENSURE THAT FUTURE RELIEF PROGRAMS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. IF CAL OSPCA IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NONPROFITS. THE AGENCY MADE IN HOUSE NONPROFIT EXPERTISE. WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE STAFF COMMENT THAT CAL O. S. B. A. IS INCREASINGLY EXPANDING ITS REACH TO THIRD NONPROFITS AND OTHER TYPES OF NONTRADITIONAL SMALL BUSINESSES. YET THE AGENCY HAS NO IN HOUSE NONPROFIT EXPERTISE OR STAFF POSITION FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NONPROFIT NEEDS. WITHOUT THAT EXPERTISE RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NONPROFITS WILL INADVERTENTLY EXCLUDE THEM WHEN APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND SELECTION CRITERIA DID NOT TAKE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT. WITHOUT RELIEF FUNDING MANY NONPROFITS WILL STRUGGLE TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES EVEN AS DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES INCREASE AND SOME NON PROFITS INCLUDING ONES THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS MAY HAVE TO CLOSE. WE URGE YOU TO REQUIRE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THE SIX OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT POSITIONS GOBIZ AND CALLOW STA ARE ASKING FOR AND THEIR B. C. P. B. N. NONPROFIT LIAISON. SOMEONE WITH EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR INCLUDING THE UNIQUE STRUCTURES FINANCES THE NEEDS OF THE FACT OF THE SECTOR. SOMEONE WILL BE PART OF THE TEAM SHAPING RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NONPROFITS AND CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS CREATE A FAIR PROCESS FOR NON PROFITS. SO THAT IF MANY NONPROFITS AS POSSIBLE GET THE RELIEF THEY NEED TO KEEP SERVING THEIR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PLEASE.
