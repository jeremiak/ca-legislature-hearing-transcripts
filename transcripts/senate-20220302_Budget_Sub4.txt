I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM. NINE ONE ONE IF I. BEGIN WITH NO COMMENT AT THIS BUT TO AND ANY YOU HAVE ON US ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE. HELLO HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE WORK OF BOTH MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. MISTER VICE CHAIR. THE OKAY I HAVE A QUESTION. THIS SIZE STATEWIDE PRIVACY OFFICER WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THAT PERSON. AND WHAT DOES PRIVACY ENTAIL BECAUSE- THAT IS A LOADED WORD IT COULD MEAN A LOT OF THINGS. EMILY JOY WHENEVER OF THE STATE'S CHIEF DATA OFFICER GIVE RESPONSES IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE- YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. I THINK YEAH. YOU HAVE AREA MISTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND- THAT I THINK THE PRIVACY- ACTUALLY MEANS LOTS OF THINGS SO LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT I THINK AT ISSUE ARE THE KEY QUESTIONS- PRIVACY OFFICERS HAVE TO ADDRESS IS- WHAT IS THE PROPER LEVEL OF DATA COLLECTION- ON THAT USAGE AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY ON PRIVACY IS AROUND. RIGHT IN THE- IN YOUR DATA AND HOW YOUR DATA IS MANAGED BY OTHERS AND SO IT'S REALLY HOW DO WE ENSURE ACROSS THE STATE NOT ONLY THE STATE HAS EXCELLENT POLICIES AROUND PRIVACY- BUT HOW DO WE- YOU POTENTIALLY. ENSURE CONSISTENCY BETTER SURE PRACTICES ACROSS GROUPS- ALL ALIGNMENT WITH ALSO THE GREATER NEED TO ADD ON TO IT USE OUR DATA NOT ONLY WITH GREATER PRIVACY BUT MORE EFFECTIVELY AND SO HAVING A CENTRAL PERSON WHO CAN ADDRESS PRIVACY QUESTIONS- RECONCILE YOU KNOW CONFUSION AROUND ON THE APPLICATION OF PRIVACY LAW AS YOU AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW. AND THAT NOT ONLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ON THERE ARE MANY MANY MANY LAWS ON AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING ON THE USE OF THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING DATA- ACROSS MANY SECTORS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN WHETHER IT'S FINANCIAL DATA HEALTH DATA- FEEL DATA ABOUT HOW AND HOMELESSNESS SERVICES AND SO HAVING ON A CENTRAL PLACE TO CALM FOR CONSISTENT GUIDANCE ACROSS THE STATE- WILL REALLY HELP FURTHER ON THE STATE'S. ONGOING COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THE PRIVACY OF OUR RIGHTS AND- SO IS THIS ABOUT HAVING A REPOSITORY FOR ALL OF THIS DATA. OR IS IT ABOUT HAVING- PROVIDING- GUIDANCE TO HOW DATA IS COLLECTED ACROSS ALL AGENCIES WITHIN THE STATE GOVERNMENT. DEFINITELY THE LATTER RIGHT SAID THIS IS AN- THIS IS HOWEVER YOUNG YES WHEN WE COLLECT DATA HOW DO WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT IS ON YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES WHAT IS SHARED GUIDANCE THAT WE CAN DEVELOP AROUND THAT THAT CAN BE STATEWIDE SO THERE'S JUST LAST USER CLAIMING THE LEVEL. THE LATTER OF- ON YOU AND HEARING TO THE STATE'S EXISTING VERY STRONG AND POWERFUL POLICIES AND SO. ON IT'S ABOUT THAT CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK AND GUIDANCE AS WELL AS- A GO TO PLACE FOR EMERGING OR NEW PRIVACY ISSUES THAT MIGHT COME UP IN THE CONTEXT THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE FAKE. RIGHT OKAY USUALLY PEOPLE ARE COMING YOU ARE OFTEN COMING TO ME FOR THAT GUIDANCE AND THAT'S NOT REALLY APPROPRIATE I DON'T HAVE THE FULL EXPERTISE FOR THAT AND SO HAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN BE FOCUSED ON THOSE ISSUES. IN DEVELOPING CONSISTENT GUIDANCE AND BEING CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE IT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE. YEAH MANAGER IF I COULD JUST ADD THIS IS AN AREA WITHIN OUR AGENCY WHAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP THIS EXPERTISE WE OVERSEE QUITE A FEW STATE ENTITIES WHO HAVE A LOT OF. LOCAL INFORMATION RANGING TAX. FROM THE- RATING TO HUMAN RESOURCE AND FROM. FOR STATE EMPLOYEE. PENSION INFORMATION NOT ENGINE SYSTEMS. SO AND WE ALSO OVERSEE THE CONTROL AGENCY DEPARTMENTS. ALEC DDG ASTON CD T. WHO ALL HAVE HUGE ROLES ARE COMMON EIGHTY- REQUIREMENTS AT ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS. AT THE PLACE TO LOOK AT AGENCY HERE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THAT EXPERTISE AND WE PLAN ON. HIRING FOR THIS POSITION TO DEVELOP THAT INTERNALLY SO WE CAN HELP PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT FROM. OUR LEVEL HERE AND YOU CAN. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- SO NO OTHER QUESTIONS WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS THE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER. AND ON. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START WITH THAT- HI MANAGER JUSTIN HARD AGAIN IT CUT OFF. FOR YOU IS THAT TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THAT WILL ACTUALLY FORMALLY. THE SHE EQUITY OFFICER IN. AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME. FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT THAT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL WITH PETE I'M IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET RECEIVE FUNDING AND APPROVAL FOR THIS POSITION HOWEVER THE TRAILER BILL WAS NOT AND APPROVED ULTIMATELY AS PART OF THE BUDGET SO THEREFORE WE WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING IS TO FORMALLY HAVE ESTABLISHED STATUTES AS AN APPOINTEE OF THE GOVERNOR- SO THAT WE CAN THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH. THE EFFORTS- AGENCIES EVEN DIVERSITY IN. THROUGHOUT STATE OPERATION. HAPPY AND ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE RELATED TO THE THANK YOU SO BEFORE I DO THAT I'M I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA LEAVE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY THREE OPEN AND WE ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING ITEM NUMBER THIRTY FOUR OPEN AND NOW WE ARE ON ITEM NUMBER THIRTY FIVE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER AND FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT.

ALAMO AERO SIMILARLY NO COMMENTS ON THIS BILL. OKAY GREAT VICE CHAIR. WELL IS THIS NOW FORMALLY STATUTORILY CREATED OR IS THIS ANTICIPATED TO BE CREATED. THIS WOULD BE FORM SIX BALLOTS FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE THE POSITION AS AN APPOINTEE OF THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS DEFINING. RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL BE WORKING ON BUT THAT DIDN'T HAS NOT PASSED YET HAVE NOT PASSED YET THAT IS CORRECT LAST YEAR WE DID RECEIVE FUNDING IN POSITION OF AUTHORITY BUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE AUTHORITY- IN STATUTE IN TERMS OF KIND OF PUTTING TOGETHER AT THE- FRAMEWORK WHAT THIS INDIVIDUAL BE WORKING ON A LEGAL DEFENSE AND- CRITICAL TO. THE BATTING STATUTE ARE WE GONNA GET IN THE HABIT NOW AND GOVERNMENT OF- PUTTING BUDGET STUFF THE END BUT. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A STATUTE TO. FROM THAT OF. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'VE BEEN AROUND THIS PLACE TO DON LONG TIME. AND AS FAR AS STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHING. THE THAT IS NECESSARY TO GO THROUGH THE BILL PROCESS- WE RECEIVED FUNDING BUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THAT STATUTORY AUTHORITY OR THE UP TWENTY FEET LAST YEAR THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR WE KIND OF VIEWED AS THE TECHNICAL CLEAN UP TO LAST YEAR'S. I NEED APPROVAL MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN THAT SIR I'M NOT GONNA LOOK FAVORABLY ON THIS. LET IT GO OKAY SENATOR RON A QUESTION WHICH IS HOW MANY- OUTCOMES OR GOALS BEEN DEFINED FOR THIS PARTICULAR OPPOSITION. NOW ADD TO DATE HAS NOT AND WE HAVE THE YOU TO DO THE STATE ARE ALREADY TO GO TO. ROOF FOR THIS POSITION- BUT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT THIS DECISION WILL DO IT'S KIND OF THAT PROCESS. I NEED- SOME GOALS AND- CORRUPTS STATE ON. RELATED TO LACK DILUTION AND DIVERSITY AND THEY'LL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CONTROL AGENCY DEPARTMENTS ON THAT EFFORT. THIS ITEM OPEN AND THEN MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY SIX. WHICH IS FREE RELIEF FOR NEW BUSINESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TOMORROW JOHNSON HERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL BE PRESENTING AT THIS A PROPOSAL TO YOU TODAY. AT THE BUDGET INCLUDES THIRTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO WAY FIRST TIME FILING FEES FOR NEW BUSINESSES REGISTERING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE FROM JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY CARDS FURTHER BUSINESS GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA THE WAY FILING FEES ARE FOR CORPORATIONS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. I REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WITH WHICH SPECIFIES THAT FUNDING MUST BE SPENT ON THE WAVING OF THOSE SPECIFIC FEES THAT THE AMOUNT COULD POTENTIALLY BE INCREASED IF MORE BUSINESSES THAN ANTICIPATED FILE AND THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE CHAU REPORTS ON THE FINAL AMOUNT OF BILLS WAIVED FEES WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE'VE REVIEWED THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL. AND AS THEY POINTED OUT ALL THE FILING FEE AMOUNTS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS MERIT- THERE AY BE CALIFORNIANS THAT HVE THOUGHT ABOUT CREATING A BUSINESS BUT HAVEN'T DONE SO YET AND THIS PROPOSAL COULD BE THE ENCOURAGEMENT THEY NEED TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN SUBMITTING THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION AND STARTING THAT BUSINESS FORMATION PROCESS. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THIS IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS FUNDING IS PROJECTED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES I JOINING ME TODAY IS BETSY BOGARD FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND WE'RE BOTH HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM FINANCE. YOU MEAN THE L. A. L. MAN YES I'M SORRY- THIS IS NICK SCHROEDER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS THE AGENDA INDICATES AND HAS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE INDICATED- WE DO HAVE A COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL AND- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSAL. ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WON'T MEANINGFULLY- LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR NEW BUSINESSES ON THE TREND HAS BEEN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN GROWING NUMBERS OF NEW BUSINESSES FILING- WITHOUT REDUCTION AND IN LIGHT OF THESE COSTS THE TAKES. THE START UP A NEW BUSINESS- IN CALIFORNIA THE- THE SMALL SIZE OF THE P. REALLY IT WOULD NOT BE THE THING THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM- THE OPENING OF A BUSINESS STATE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO RECOMMEND THOSE THAT IF YOU DO ADOPT THE PROPOSAL- WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS MORE SPECIFIC AND SO THAT IS MY MORE EXPLICIT AS FAR AS WHICH- FEES ARE BEING WAIVED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR- AND THE LAST PIECE THAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO REVIEW THE FUND ITSELF BECAUSE- IT. WE THAT THE CURRENTLY PAID BY BUSINESS. NEW BUSINESS ANNEX THIS. ARE HIGHER THAN THEY NEED TO BE ASSISTING ON- THAT BEING SAID THE BUSINESS CONNECT- SYSTEM IS IN ITS LAST MODULE HI AND- IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE. THE SECRETARY STATES OPERATIONS AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE FEW LEVEL OR- RESERVE LEVELS ARE FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS SO WE THINK. THAT THE LEGISLATURE EVENTUALLY SHOULD DIRECT- THE MINISTRATION REPORT ON WHAT THE AS WELL AS RESERVE WOMAN. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN IT UP FOR DISCUSSION AND QUESTIONS FROM OUR- COMMITTEE I SEE SENATOR ROTH HAS HIS HAND UP. OKAY VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU A THANK YOU MISTER BOETTCHER THANK YOU VENTURE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMMON IN THE AGENDA OF THE TALKS ABOUT. AND SUGGESTED BUSINESS IS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN PAYING HIGHER FEES AND NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. GIVEN THE TRANSFERS TO THE GENERAL FUND IN THE- ASSISTANCE THIS IS TIED TO THE RESERVE LIMIT OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS I GUESS WHY NOT INCREASE THE RESERVE LIMIT AND REDUCE. THE BUSINESS FEES CHARGED TO BUSINESSES AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND THEN ADJUST AS NECESSARY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS WE MOVE TO THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR MODULE TO WHATEVER FOLLOWS. ANY TAKERS. SURE I CAN AGO FIRSTHAND DON'T. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE UNDERSTAND SHOOT THIS FUND IS SUPPOSED TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT AND SO YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL IN ESTABLISHING THE FUNDS THE STRUCTURE AND- THE RESERVE LIMITS TO ENSURE THEY CAN'T REMAIN TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT I THINK THAT CONSIDERING THE BUSINESS CONNECTION IS GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW THE DIVISION OPERATES. IT MIGHT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHAT RESOURCES SECTOR STATE NEEDS- AND WHAT FEW LEVELS MIGHT BE REQUIRED AND SO THAT IS WHY WE RECOMMEND THAT IT BE A DECISION IS MADE LATER THAT BEING SAID IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT THEY CAN DEVELOP SOONER THAN THAT- IT DID IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD IDEA. BUT THAT'S WEIRD WE DEAL WITH SPECIAL FUNDS AND SPECIAL FUND INSOLVENCY ALL THE TIME IN OUR BUDGET WOULD THIS NOT BE DEALT WITH BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE RESERVE IF WE CAN'T PREDICT. THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BUSINESS CONNECT OPERATION INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE TO COVER ANTICIPATED. COSTS REDUCE THE- OVER. WARM REDUCED FEES CHARGED TO BUSINESS. AND THEN FURTHER IT JUST AS BUSINESS CONNECT COMES ONLINE AND NUMBER ONE QUESTION NUMBER TWO. THIS IS STATE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY WE DON'T ENTER INTO PRO OF PROJECTS BUSINESS CONNECT OR OTHERWISE. WITHOUT HAVING A BUSINESS PLAN AND DOING PROJECTIONS AS TO REVENUE AND EXPENSES CORRECT. SERA THIS IS BETTY BOGAERT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE I AM THE- CHIEF OF THE BUSINESS PROGRAM DIVISION A CO SPONSOR FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESS CONNECT. WE ARE EXCITED TO REPORT THAT THE BUSINESS CONNECT FINAL MODULE FOR BUSINESS ENTITY FEATURES IS GOING INTO- GOING TO BE LAUNCHED AT THE END OF THIS MONTH MARCH TWENTY NINE- AND IT WILL PROVIDE FOR ONLINE SERVICES FOR- CORPORATIONS RELIABILITY COMPANIES AND LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. WE DO HAVE- REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND EXPENDITURES AS YOU MENTIONED- THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE UTILIZED HAND TALLIES- TO HELP THE NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED. AND SO WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE AT LEAST A YEAR OF STABILITY TO DETERMINE- WHAT CLASSIFICATIONS WE NEED IN ORDER TO- BEST SERVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO. TO- THE MAKE SURE THAT HAVE. SUFFICIENT MEANS THE BASE ARTS CURRY CHARGED. CORPORATIONS IS A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO- FOR THE INITIAL FILING AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS ARE SEVENTY DOLLARS SO THOSE TREES- WE FEEL OUR ARE REASONABLE- V. WE CERTAINLY ARE IN FAVOR OF RAISING THE MILLION DOLLAR THRESHOLD OR WITHHOLD AMOUNT- THAT WILL WILL BETTER SUPPORT- ARE. PROJECTIONS SO AT ANY TIME THAT ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT WE WOULD NOT BE OPPOSED TO THAT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE WOULD WE WOULD PREFER TO WAIT ON ADJUSTING FEES UNTIL WE COULD PRESENT AN ENTIRE PLAN- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE APPROPRIATE ACTION. ALTHOUGH I'M JUST JUMPING BACK INTO THIS. BUDGET BUSINESS AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SO I MAY HAVE LOST THE BUBBLE BUT SEEMS TO ME THE APPROPRIATE POSITION WOULD BE TO RETAIN THE MONEY TO INCREASE THE RESERVE LIMIT TO. BUILD THE RESERVES IF THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE EXPENSE LEVEL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BUSINESS CONNECT- MODEL AND THEN AS THE RESERVES BUILD IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU. ARE YOU HAVE A SUFFICIENT RESERVE TO DEAL WITH CONTINGENCIES THEN START REDUCING THE FEES TO BUSINESS OR FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT BENEFITS THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU SERVICE. AS OPPOSED TO THE GENERAL FUND. THOSE ARE MY ONLY COMMENT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU ALL PROVIDE. PERFORMING PROVIDE FOR ALL OF US OVER THERE EVERY DAY THANK YOU A MANAGER. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR CONVINCE ME THAT THIS IS MORE THAN JUST SYMBOLIC IT IS SO MINIMAL. AND THE FILINGS HAVE GROWN CONSIDERABLY HELLO THAT WOULD NOT APPEAR TO INDICATE ANY DETERRENT FROM THE CURRENT LEVELS OF THE FEES- SO WE'RE GOING TO. MAYBE THIS SOUNDS CUTE BUT WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ANY NUMBERS OF A PROJECTIONS OF HOW MANY BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO REALLY PROSPER BY THIS IS GOING TO TURN OF BUSINESSES AROUND MY GOSH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO MOST OF OUR THINGS HARM BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL. TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT SO SIGNIFICANT. TELL ME HOW MUCH MORE THAN SYMBOLIC. RIGHT TO MY PER CAPITA FINANCE I GO BACK TO OUR OUR AT OUR PRIOR COMMENT THAT WE DO THINK THERE COULD BE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO BUSINESS BUT NEVER SHE TOOK THAT STEP AND HELP THEM BUT AND I'D ALSO POINT OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU SAID PATRICK. I WE DID INCLUDE BUDGET WILLINGLY FOR THAT REASON WHERE- SIGGERS THEY'LL BE- REPORTING ON WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IN THE- ENTRANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN. AND WE HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JASON FOR COUNTING KEEP HER PERMISSION AFTER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS I AM INTRODUCING TO BCPS THAT REQUEST FUNDING TO SUPPORT SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS FOR TO MISSION CRITICAL IT SYSTEMS. FIRST THE BCP FOR THE BRIEF SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND CREDIT CARD FUNDING REQUEST TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONGOING. THE PROJECT BASED INCLUDED IN JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN I HAVE BEEN IN A MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS BASED. SENSE FENCE POST SINCE THEN SUPPORTING THE DAILY BUSINESS NEED. A PROGRAM. YES THE MODIFICATION ARE SUPPORTED ENTIRELY BY STATE I. T. STAFF. THIS FUNDING WILL COVER COST CENTERS INCLUDING FUNDING FOR STATE I CAN STAFF SALARIES AND BENEFITS TRAINING FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE FONG. THE FUNDING REQUESTED IN THIS B. C. P. FOR FREE SUPPORT REPRESENT THE BASELINE COSTS THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES JUST FOR NORMAL MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS MOVING FORWARD. OF THE TWELVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTED FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ROUGHLY HALF OF THE A THIRD OF THE REQUEST WILL BE ALLOCATED TO PAY FOR PROCESSING FEES ON BEHALF OF APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES WHO PAY ONLINE USING A CREDIT CARD. THE SECOND BCP REQUEST ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. TO SUPPORT THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS FOR THE CONNECT SYSTEM. WHICH IS UTILIZED BY FORTY CA PROGRAM. EJECTA DELIVER FIVE MAJOR SOFTWARE RELEASES JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THAT ALLOW THE FORTY CA PROGRAMS LICENSEES AND APPLICANTS. TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS ONLINE REMEDIATE ANY APPLICATION DEFICIENCIES AND RECEIVE EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE ALERTS RELEVANT TO THEIR PENDING APPLICATION OR LICENSE STATUS. THE SYSTEM ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE SUBMISSION AND PROCESSING OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AMONG OTHER FEATURES. ROGIC IS SCHEDULED TO COMPLETE IN LATE APRIL BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREMENTAL APPROACH DELIVERY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY THE FOUR PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT HAVE ALREADY SEEN OUR- OF THE SYSTEM RELEASE IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PROGRAM TO PROCESS OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONLINE TRANSACTIONS. AND OVER I'VE BEEN ONLINE VIA CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO MENTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS AWARE OF THE L. A. WITH RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DEPARTMENT PROPOSAL CONTINGENT UPON THE INCREASES. THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVE THIS LANGUAGE COULD CREATE LOGISTICAL FINDING ISSUES THAT COULD IMPACT CONSUMER PROTECTION AS SEVERAL OF THE PROPOSALS. ARE TO CONTINUE FUNDING FOR EXISTING RESOURCES. THESE RESOURCES EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IT'S ANY FEE INCREASE LEGISLATION WOULD NOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL LATE TWENTY TWENTY Q. AND NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT WOULD CAUSE A GAP IN AUTHORIZED RESOURCES FOR THE BOARD IN EUROPE. ESSENTIALLY HALTING PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITIES IN THOSE AREAS. THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MANY STAFF TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION THAT WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THESE TWO REQUESTS. I'M JOINED TODAY BY JOHN O'CONNOR CAN TAILOR SHIFT AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU SO NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM FINANCE. CHARLIE MANNING THE OF. WHERE IS OF DC I'D PROPOSALS PRESENTED TODAY WHICH CONTINUES THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS OF BREEZE THE STAFF OF SUPPORT IT I'M GOING SOFTWARE AND DATA COSTS AS WELL AS MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION COHORT ONE SOFTWARE ALTERNATIVE. ALSO IN RESPONSE TO THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS DCA HAS MADE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES OF THE SUGGESTED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. AS IT WOULD DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENTLY PASSED LEGISLATION AND THE CONTINUATION OF EXISTING OPERATIONS AND IT PROJECTS AND ESPECIALLY DELAY FUNDING TO PROGRAMS THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND SUPPORT LICENSEES IN THE STATE. UNTIL SHE INCREASE IS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THANK YOU. BUT THE ALEJO AND WAS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THEM THAT. ARE WE HAVE WE TAKEN ISSUE WITH A RAISE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY DCA AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE DO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME. FUND INSOLVENCY ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE DCA FINDS- THREE OF WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS AND BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROPOSALS- THESE FUNDS THAT HAVE STRUCTURAL IMBALANCES AND ARE PROJECTED TO BECOME INSOLVENT OR GO INTO A DEFICIT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. I'M SPECIFICALLY THIS INCLUDES THE CONTINGENT FUND BOB THE MEDICAL BOARD WHICH HAS SPENDING THROUGH THE BREEZE PROPOSAL. THE PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION FINE AND THE STATE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS FIND- BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECEIVING A FUNDING- PROPOSED RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. SOFT ON THE MINISTRATION IS PLANNING TO SEE FEE INCREASES FOR THE POLICY PROCESS IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AS IS COMMON PRACTICE- HOWEVER THIS APPROACH DISCONNECTS ME ON THE HEALTH OF THE FIND AND RESOLVING INSOLVENCY ISSUE SOME FROM THE FIND- I'M AWAY FROM THE PROPOSALS TO INCREASE EXPENDITURES OUT OF THESE. THAT ARE ALREADY PROTECTED TO GO INSOLVENT I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES EXPENDITURES FROM THE FINDS OUT WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN THE RESPECTIVE FINDS. I'M SPECIFICALLY BY ASSOCIATING THE FUNDING BILL MAKING FUNDING AVAILABLE ONLY IF LEGISLATION IS ENACTED TO INCREASE THE SPEED AND WE FELT WOULD HELP. I'M TIED THE INSOLVENCY ISSUE AFTER FIND TO THE EXPENDITURE PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT APPROVING ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES OUT OF FUNDS I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. IT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU- I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE RECORD THAT'S SENATOR COME. IS NOT PRESENT NIELSEN VICE CHAIR YOU HAVE ANY. WELL I JUST WITH A THAT THE- AT RE. SEEM TO GET THIS BACK AND CON THAT YOU. HAVE UNINSURED OF YOUR FUNDING. BEFORE YOU'RE MOVING A. AT THE RESIDENCE ME THAT WE'RE STARTING TO GET IN THE HABIT OF DOING THAT. AND SO I WOULD. WOULD A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT THE RELIGION YESTERDAY AS PROCEED. THANK YOU FOR THAT ROB. THE MANAGER OF. AS THE PARTICIPANTS KNOW I TYPICALLY SEE THESE ISSUES ONCE AGAIN AND ANOTHER SIDE OF WHAT WE DO HERE ON THE POLICY SIDE AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH FUND IN SONG OF SOLVENCY AND PROPOSED FEE INCREASES WHICH ARE NOT. EASY SUBJECTS TO DEAL WITH AND IT'S- IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WE'VE- I HAVE CREATED OUR OWN PROBLEM IN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONSUMER AFFAIRS AREA WE- DECIDE FOR PURPOSES OF CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WE NEED TO SET UP AN ARCHITECTURE. WHERE WE ESTABLISH BOARDS AND BUREAUS AND WE'VE DONE THAT FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE OR THIRTY SIX OF THEM AS I RECALL. AND WE SET UP A PROCESS BY WHICH WE LICENSE PEOPLE. REQUIRE THAT THEY HAVE CERTAIN SKILLS AND EDUCATION AND TRAINING BUT ONCE AGAIN FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND TO FIND THIS A SYSTEM THAT WE SET UP ACROSS THESE VARIOUS BOARDS AND BUREAUS WHICH ARE STAFFED BY. STATE EMPLOYEES THE STATE WAGE AND BENEFIT SCHEDULE AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT WHICH ALL CARRIES A PRICE TAG. WE SET LICENSE FEES. AND IN PART THOSE LICENSE FEES PAID BY THOSE LICENSEES OR TO ENSURE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE LICENSED IN THOSE TO DONATE HERE. TO THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT OR THE STANDARDS OF PRACTICE OR ARE DISCIPLINED AND LICENSES ARE ADJUSTED. BUT THEN AS GOVERNMENT TYPICALLY DOES AND I'M NOT A CRITIC OF GOVERNMENT BUT GOVERNMENT HAS A COST WE HAD SYSTEMS AND PROCESS. WE APPROVE MO USE. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WHICH GET EXPENSIVE. AND THEN BECAUSE THIS DCA BOARD IN BUREAU PROCESS WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY KNOWS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO TO HER PRAYER LIFE- CARRIES A COST AND IT'S THIS IS FUNDED SOLELY BY THE LICENSEES WE THEN TURN AROUND AND WE ARE FORCED TO INCREASE LICENSE FEES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE FUND INSOLVENCY BECAUSE BY AND I. T. PROJECT AND OTHER THINGS. THAT THEN RESULT IN A PRESSURE TO INCREASE THE LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEES. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A COMPLETELY BIZARRE AND UNWORKABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE. SYSTEM AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE TO DISCUSS THAT TODAY EXCEPT IT IS PART OF THIS AND I'M JUST TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS POINT AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE. AND DECIDE WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY LICENSE THE LICENSEE SHOULD PAY THROUGH THEIR LICENSE FEES AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE USED FOR AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THIS THAT ARE PART OF STATE GOVERNMENT THAT ARE UNRELATED UNRELATED TO WHAT THE LICENSEES ARE DOING WITH THEIR LICENSES. THAT OUGHT TO BE FUNDED APPROPRIATELY BY THE GENERAL FUND. SO I'VE NOW GIVEN MY LECTURE FOR THE DAY AND I WILL STOP TALKING BUT I WOULD LIKE TO AT SOME POINT HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE. ON THE WAY WE'VE STRUCTURED THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THE WAY WE'VE STRUCTURED THIS LICENSE AND LICENSE FEE PROCESS. AND WHAT THE LICENSE FEES ARE USED FOR BECAUSE- HAVING LOOKED AT THIS NOW FOR TWO YEARS IT'S NOT WORKING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR TOLERATING NO NO I MEAN DOES ANYONE WOULD. YOU CARE TO COMMENT OR RESPOND TO THAT MAYBE- TO DCA. THANK. THAT'S OKAY I WOULDN'T EITHER IF IT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION TO THE EXTENT IT WAS EVEN A QUESTION I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU WE'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE COMIC THE MAJESTIC OF THE MAKE THE PROPOSAL AND THIS IS KIMBERLY HARBISON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT SENATOR ROTH AND WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION THAT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. THANKS CABALLERO. WELL I THINK THAT SENATOR ROCKET ON AN ON AN ISSUE THAT THAT IS- THAT IS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT DESERVE SOME SOME DISCUSSION AND IF HE'S GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION I LIKE TO BE A PART OF THAT HAVING- SAT IN THE SECRETARY CHAIR- WITH THE CA AND- AND HAVING INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BREACH PROGRAM- AB I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY WHAT THE- WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND- AND- THE DECISION WAS TO BUY A BIG. I. T. PROGRAM AND- HAVE EVERYBODY PUT IN A LITTLE PIECE. OF IT IS AND- BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES CHANGE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS A HARD THING. FOR DEPARTMENTS AND FOR BOARDS TO DO. AND- SO. THAT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAVE TO ADD TO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU WILL MAKE. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT CONSUMER PRIVACY IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. AND WE'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHERYL HOW MODERN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ASH HOUSEHOLDS HAUNTING.

WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THE YOU. THE JOURNALIST. AS CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WAS ALLUDED TO- WE'VE NOTED TO STAFF THAT ADDS THAT FIND THAT SUPPORT STEER YOU JUST HAVE SOME INSOLVENCY ISSUES THAT AS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE AND HOWEVER HE MINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSED SEEN ON ANY FEE RELATED CHANGES AT THIS TIME AND SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO MY CONDITION OR HEALTH OF THE FIND ON AND WE DON'T HAVE. ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL'S. I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS GOING TO BE AN OPEN I YET AND WE WILL GO TO NUMBER FORTY THAT THE- TECHNICAL ASIAN SERVICES STATEWIDE CENTRALIZED SERVICE GENERAL FUND REQUEST. I'M FORTY. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MILES FRIEND ADAM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR- ADMINISTRATION AND CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY- WITH ME IS REST NICHOLS ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. THERE ARE PRETTY CLOSELY RELATED THE FIRST ONE. WOOD AB IS A FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND REQUEST FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT WOULD BE A CONVERSION OF EXISTING- TECHNOLOGY SERVICE SERVICES REVOLVING FUND OF THORNY FROM THAT FROM OUR COST RECOVERY FUND YES OR AT TO THE GENERAL FUND- WHICH WOULD. PAY FOR ALLOW US TO SHIFT THE FUNDING FROM COST RECOVERY TO GENERAL FUND FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS THE OTHER THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT MAKE UP THE FORTY FOUR MILLION I WOULD BE A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION FOR- A STATEWIDE REPORTING CONSULTING CONTRACT DOLLARS THAT WE ARE HERE TO FOR. SOARED WITHIN. YES OUR AFTER A FORTY- AS I SAY THIS YEAH WOULD ALLOW US TO BASICALLY TAKE SOME TWO HUNDRED FIVE POSITIONS ABOUT A FIFTH OF HIS OVERALL POSITIONS MOVING FROM COST RECOVERY TO THE GENERAL FUND SO WE'RE NO LONGER COST RECOVER FROM THEM THAT WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE EXISTING OVERHEAD POSITIONS THAT ARE STE IN T. S. R. F. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE INDIRECT POSITIONS AS WELL- CDT LOOKS AT THREE COST KIND OF PLACES WHERE DIRECT INDIRECT AND IN OVERHEAD SO THIS WOULD AFFECT TWO OF THOSE THREE- IT WOULD ALLOW ZTE TO REDUCE ITS RATES BY APPROXIMATELY 10% AND I WOULD KNOW. THAT DAT UM C. D. IF THESE WERE TO PASS WOULD STILL BE A PREDOMINANTLY COST RECOVERY ORGANIZATION THIS WOULD MOVE US FROM ABOUT RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY- CD T. COST RECOVERS ABOUT 86% OF ITS COST WITH THE WITH THE REMAINDER BEING. BY LARGE GENERAL FUND AT THE REMAINING THAT 86% ABOUT 77% SO WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT 23% GENERAL FUND- THE OTHER PROPOSAL. IS A BY THE WAY THAT IS A THREE YEAR ASK- TENDED TO COVER TO COVER THAT SHIFT THAT CONVERSION THREE YEARS FOR THE NEXT ONE IS ALSO A THREE YEAR ASKING IT IS. A TEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. GENERAL FUND ASK- YOUR COVER A REVENUE HOLD IT IS GOING TO BE CREATED- BY TWO OF OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS- MOVING OUT OF THE DATA CENTER LEAST SOME OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND APPLICATIONS OUT OF THE DATA CENTER. LIKE A LOT OF B. BECAUSE IT IS A DATA CENTER IN IT HAS A FAIRLY HIGH FIXED COST STRUCTURE- BETWEEN- PERSONAL SERVICES- AND THE HARDWARE AND- PERCH. WE MAKE TO MAINTAIN THAT CENTER- IN WE LOSE. CUSTOMERS WHAT WHEN CUSTOMERS MIGRATE OFF FROM- AND GO TO THE CLOUD OR OR OR WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING IN THIS CASE- HE- WE CAN DECREASE OUR COST STRUCTURE IS QUICKLY AS AS WE FEEL THE REVENUE HERE SO THIS TEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHAT. WOULD COVER THAT HOLDS THAT THE REQUEST IS FOR THREE YEARS ON BOTH CASES YOU HELP TO GIVE CDT- THE RUNWAY THAT IT NEEDS TO REALLY REEVALUATE ITS ITS COST RECOVERY MODEL- IN ITS SERVICE DELIVERY AND DO BRING. IT'S COSTS IN LINE WITH ITS READINESS AND WITH THAT I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS EARLY THANK YOU FINANCE. HELLO RYAN ONE OF THE FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON DISPOSAL I GET. VERY LITTLE JOURNALIST. BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED ONLY BUDGET YOUR FUNDING FOR BOTH PROPOSALS. AND TO REJECT REQUESTED OUT OF YOUR FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT CONTINUES THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CTA'S BUSINESS MODEL FOR PROVIDING IT SERVICES. THESE PROPOSALS NOT ONLY SEEK TO ADDRESS REVENUE LOSSES BUT DECLINING CUSTOMER BASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT STATE DATA CENTER. ONE REASON APPEARS TO BE SOME STATE DATA CENTER RATES ARE NOT COMPETITIVELY PRICED AS SHOWN IN THE AGENDA. ANOTHER REASON IS DIRECT RATE COMPARISON BETWEEN PRIVATE VENDORS IN THE STATE DATA CENTER INCLUDING BENEFITS SPECIFIC TO STATE SERVICES IS DIFFICULT FOR STATE ENTITIES TO UNDERTAKE. THE PROPOSALS AS CURRENTLY PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ARE MISSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANTICIPATED RATE REEVALUATION PROCESS THAT IS EXPECTED TO LIMIT ADDITIONAL REVENUE LOSSES. AND MAKE STATE DATA DATA CENTER REITS MORE COMPETITIVE. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE IMPACTS OF THIS PROCESS ON CORE SERVICES PROVIDED TO STATE ENTITIES AND THE ANTICIPATED SHIFT THE FUNDING FOR SOME I. T. SERVICES. TO THE GENERAL FUND IN THE FUTURE SUGGEST A MORE ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS. THEREFORE WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTION PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT DIRECTS DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFINE THE RATE REEVALUATION PROCESS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT INCLUDING THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE AGENDA. IN THE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I HAVE JUMP ON THE POINT IF I MAY THE- PRINT CONTROL LANGUAGE TO SUGGEST THEY WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. REALLY MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THERE HAS TO BE MORE OF AN ENFORCEMENT. ABILITY I THANK. AND TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE TROUBLED AGENCIES IN STATE GOVERNMENT FOR DECADES OUR- TECH PROJECTS HAVE GONE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OVER BUDGET. FEW IF ANY OF COMING IN ON TIME. AND I CERTAINLY CONCUR WITH THE ANALYST ABOUT NO THREE YEAR FUNDING- IT JUST SEEMS THAT THIS THIS AGENCY PARTICULARLY WOULD REQUIRE A LOT MORE. SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT PROBLEMS. AND BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS COST. LOOKING AT THE FOR YOUR ANALYSTS- LITTLE CHART HERE ON PAGE FIFTY SIX. COMPARING CD KEY AND MAJOR OTHER CORPORATIONS AMAZON MICROSOFT GOOGLE IBM. CAN SOMEONE IN THE AGENCY TELL ME WHY SEARCHES INCREDIBLE DISCREPANCY IN THOSE COSTS. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON THIS IS ROSS NICHOLS IN THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF PARKING TECHNOLOGY THIS PROPOSAL TO HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS ACTUALLY FULLY INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT DISCREPANCY SO THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES MANY SERVICES- YOU MENTIONED ARE YOU ALLUDED TO OVERSIGHT SERVICES. RUNS A PROJECT WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT- AND A NUMBER OF OTHER SERVICES TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS. IN OUR RATE STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE COST RECOVERY WHAT HAPPENS IS AS WE BUILD THOSE RATES FOR STORAGE WHICH IS ONE OF THE LINE ITEMS THAT YOU SEE IN THAT TABLE. THAT LINE ITEM INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE DIRECT COST OF THE STAFFING AND THE EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE STORAGE BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE STAFF IN OUR LEGAL OPTIONS IN OUR HR ALL. OLLIE THE OTHER ANCILLARY OPERATIONS OF CBP CONTRACTS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE DIRECT SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT DOES ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE. THE RATES THAT WE HAVE TO CHARGE BOTH STATE ENTITIES AND TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THAT'S STRIVE TO OUR SERVICES WE HAVE QUITE A NUMBER. OF CONSUMERS THAT ARE NOT STATE AGENCIES ORGANIZATIONS AND SO OUR INTENT IS TO RESTRUCTURE. OUR- OUR BILLING MECHANISM ARE RATE SETTING PROCESS TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT OUR RATES ARE COMPETITIVE BUT THE TRANSPARENT SO THAT ORGANIZATIONS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE PAYING. FOR WHEN THEY SUBSCRIBE TO OUR SERVICE. LET ME THAT INQUIRED OF JAN WAS JUST THIS MAKE SURE. TO YOU AND- IT IS A WAY TO AND THIS WE JUST SHE- COSTS AROUND AND NOT REALLY MAKING A SUBSTANTIVE DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN I THINK THE QUESTION WE EVER REYES BY INCLUDING THIS SHARK IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPOSED SHIFT OF THESE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES FROM COST RECOVERY TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO BRING RATES DOWN BY ABOUT TEN PERCENT. ACROSS THE BOARD OR ON AVERAGE I SHOULD SAY- WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSED THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT CDC IS CHARGING FOR SOME SERVICES AND WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN OFFER- WE ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THEY ALSO NOTED THAT SOME OF THEIR SERVICES EVEN IF THEY WERE REDUCED TO DIRECT COSTS ONLY. WOULD STILL NOT BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO ABSENT YOU KNOW IN DIRECTOR OVERHEAD COSTS THERE ARE SOME SERVICES THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT AS COMPETITIVE- AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS SUGGEST AGAIN BUT THE NEED FOR RE RE EVALUATION PROCESS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT WILL BE TAKING PLACE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BUT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE AN INTEREST- IN CONTINUING TO OVERSEE THAT PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES ABOUT PROCESSOR MADE CLEAR FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. I WOULD HAVE. IT IF YOU WOULD COME FORWARD TO US FROM FROM SUGGESTIONS OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXERT MORE FORMAL AND REGULAR AND IN DEPTH. OVERSIGHT OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL OF ACQUISITIONS. IT JUST TO ME VERY VERY OPPRESSIVE OUT OF CONTROL AND NON FUNCTIONAL ALMOST ALL OF OUR MAJOR HI TECH UPGRADES AND SOME TWENTY YEARS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FAILURES ARE CREDIBLY CAUSTIC. OF SENATE CABALLERO. WHAT I WANT TO AGREE WITH THEM WAIT WHAT'S JUST BEEN SAID I GUESS WHAT I AM WHEN I READ THIS EARLIER MY CONCERN WAS IT JUST SEEMED LIKE WE WERE SHIFTING THE COST FROM ONE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SHELL GAME AND- AND PART OF THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW WHAT IT COSTS FOR US TO RUN A DEPARTMENT TO DO SOMETHING. RATHER THAN THAN- CONTRACT FOR IT AND I'M NOT FOR CONTRACTING OUT BUT- BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT DO SERVICE FOR OTHERS- A LITTLE BIT- LEANER AND MEANER AND WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT IF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE- SO AYE I SUPPORT THE ONE YEAR AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS OF COST RECOVERY. AND HOW WE DO THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT- I'D BE MANY TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE JUST TO LOOK AT THAT. I'M MORE MOST OF A MIND TO SENATOR THAT WE DO CREATE A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. CENTER OFF YOUR THOUGHT. FAMOUS VENTURE WHY I JUST WANT TO SAY. THAT I'VE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF IMPROVEMENT IN CDC'S PERFORMANCE. AND I. T. PROJECT- DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY SINCE I LANDED IN THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. OBVIOUSLY THE LARGE PROJECTS THAT WERE. INITIATED DECADES AGO LITERALLY. AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY ARE STILL ONGOING- SEEM OBVIOUSLY TO BE AN EXCEPTION BUT- AGAIN. THOSE SEEM TO BE AN EXCEPTION I JUST WANNA. SAY THAT ABOUT CDC AND HER PERSONALITY SEE AN- APPRECIATIVE I AM OF WHAT YOU TRY TO DO. FOR ALL THE REST OF US MY QUESTION HOWEVER AND I LOOKED WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS I WANT TO READ THIS. PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY WHY DO WE HAVE A STATE. THE DATA CENTER- IF IN FACT. ENTITIES ARE MIGRATING. TO THE CLOUD. AND OTHER PER. FOR A DATA STORAGE AND THE LIKE. STE THANK YOU ARE THE SENATE ROTH FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN REST NICHOLS THE DIRECTOR OF C. T. R. OUR STATE DATA CENTER HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR QUITE SOME TIME WE HAVE A LARGE MAINFRAME SYSTEM RUNS THERE IN ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF OTHER SERVICES A BULK OF STATE ORGANIZATIONS DO HAVE THEIR SYSTEMS ON SITE WITH WITH THEIR CONFIDENTIAL INSTANT. AND IMPORTANT DATA STATE SAYING AT OUR SITE IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUT IT IS NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR EVERY SYSTEMS OUT THERE AS SOME OF THE NEWER SYSTEMS COME UP IN THEIR CAPABILITIES HIM PRIVATE SECTOR WE'RE ACTUALLY TO SORTING PROCESS TO ALLOW OUR OUR STATE ORGANIZATIONS TO CONSUME APPROPRIATE- SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET. AND IN SO THAT A SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A COUPLE OF OUR LARGE TENANTS IN THE DATACENTER MOVING OFF OF THE MAINFRAME AND IN THE CLOUD BASED SOLUTIONS WHICH GENERALLY ARE CAN BE A GOOD THING FOR THE STATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REDUCE THE COST OF OPERATIONS. IN THE MEANTIME THOUGH WE STILL HAVE. A LARGE NUMBER I SPOKE WITH IN THE STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT USE OF SERVICE SO. IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS AS A QUICK MIGRATION AND RANKLY OF SERVICES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT ARE EASILY USED AS A SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE OUR BUSINESS OUT THERE AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S INVOLVED IN THOSE SYSTEMS TO SEE IF WE- WANT TO TAKE THE RISK OF HAVING THAT. MAINTAIN FIVE SEPARATE ENTITY BUT TO YOUR POINT WE DO NEED TO REEVALUATE THAT BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO RATHER THAN JUST CONTINUING THE PRACTICE THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE LITERALLY FOR DECADES. OUR WHOLE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT EACH AND EVERY SERVICE OPERATED MUCH MORE LIKE A PRIVATE BUSINESS THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE WERE MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS NOBODY CREATED BY THAT SERVICE. FRANKLY IF IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO SAY THAT OUT. LOUD IN EITHER THE COMMISSION THAT SERVICE S. OR FOR WAYS TO ITS THAT IT IS MUCH MORE. FIVE THAT IS AREN'T WITH THIS. PROM WELL THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I WAS. TO FIND A IF THERE WERE. DATUS A- ISSUE TO ON THE NAY OF THE AGENCY. LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY OTHER TYPES OF- OF DATA SYSTEMS THAT YOU UNDER LEE MAINTAIN WHERE. TRANSFERRED TO THE CLOUD OR SOME OTHER- EXTERNAL- STORAGE OF FOR WANT OF A BETTER WORD STORAGE PLACE STORAGE FACILITY. WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE OR RISKY I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT I I'M ALSO NOT. UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S JOBS. AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN TO US IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE A PERSONAL PLAN. IF IN FACT WE HAVE JOBS ON THE LINE. OF DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR YOUR YOUR OF BUSINESS PLAN REEVALUATION LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE- ULTIMATE OUTCOME TURNS OUT TO BE. MAYBE YOU MENTIONED IT WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR THIS BUSINESS PLAN REEVALUATION THE- THE REVIEW IN THE EVALUATION OF THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF THE STATE DATA CENTER. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE PLANNING IN THAT THREE YEAR CYCLE SO IN THAT THREE YEAR CYCLE AND WE ABSOLUTELY INTEND TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH L. A. L. ORDER MEMBERS. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION- BACKBOARD JUST LIKE TRACTOR STAKEHOLDERS- BUT IN THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD WE WANT TO AND- REALLY INVESTIGATE EACH OF THOSE SERVICES. AND DETERMINED NOT ONLY IF THE SERVICE IS VIABLE WHAT IS THE BEST MECHANISM TO OPERATE THAT SERVICE. ARE WE DO WANT TO DECOUPLE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DATA CENTER AND IN OUR TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION FROM SOME OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE AS AN OVERSIGHT% ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY ORGANIZATION. IN PAST BUDGET ACTIONS WE'VE ALREADY FUNDED STATE SECURITY OPERATIONS INDEPENDENTLY BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS IN OUR CYBER SECURITY PROGRAM. ARE WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING REALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE OPERATING BOTH AT THE PEAK OF AFFECTING US. IN FINANCIAL STABILITY. WELL I'M CERTAINLY IN FAVOR OF MAKING SURE THAT THE- THE I. T. A DEVELOPMENT AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT YOU OR SOMEONE YOU WERE- OPERATION PERFORM- REMAINS OF NOT ONLY VIABLE BUT ROBUST BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S IN PART THE SOLUTION. TO THE SITUATION THAT MY COLLEAGUE- THE CENTERS TO MY LEFT WAS THE VICE CHAIR WAS SPEAKING ABOUT EARLIER THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO THANK YOU A. MISSED BY FEAR THANK YOU. WILL I THINK WE WANT. KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THIS ONE AND IT'S- I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE SOME MORE BILL TO IT WE CAN'T GIVEN TOO MUCH LET OF TO BE TO- SCOTT EARNED THE- AND THAT- THAT PLAN. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THE VERY VERY SPUR. AND PRISON ON A TIME NOT LOOSE WHEN WE WOULD GET AROUND TO IT BUT DISTRIBUTION TIME CERTAIN OF THE PROFFERING OF THIS THIS PLANT. CAN YOU DO THAT WELCOME DOING THAT EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS NOT NECESSARILY WAITING UNTIL NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME WHILE WORKING WITH OUR AWAY- TO FIGURE OUT AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM OF THAT'S REPORTING THROUGH JAIL BC OR SOME OF THE- THANK YOU. AND I WITH MY PART REQUESTED LAST TO WORK WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT DOES HAPPEN WE DON'T JUST FORGET ABOUT IT. ISSUE FORTY ONE FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACQUELINE CAMPION I AM THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WITH ME AS JAMAL ON IN JEOPARDY DIRECTOR FOR THE FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DIVISION OUR PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY REQUEST ONE HUNDRED POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME COSTS FORTY FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO REPAIR AND MODERNIZE ELEVATOR SYSTEMS AND THREE STATE BUILDINGS. AND DIRECT DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEMS IN EIGHT EIGHT BUILDINGS FOR THE ELEVATOR PROJECT INDUSTRY STANDARDS PROVIDE THAT ELEVATOR EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE MODERNIZED EVERY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND HOW HEAVILY ITS USE AND ALL THREE OF THESE SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR MODERNIZATION ARE AT OR PAST THEIR USEFUL LIFE AND NEED TO BE MODERNIZED TO IMPROVE SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS ENSURE SAFETY. AND PREVENT POTENTIAL INJURY OR ENTRAPMENT. ADDITIONALLY FOR THE DIRECT DIGITAL CONTROL PROJECT THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT CONSIST OF SMART EQUIPMENT THAT CAN COMMUNICATE DIGITALLY WITH OPERATORS EACH OTHER. HVAC CONTROLS LIGHTING FIRE ALARM AND SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS AND IN SOME CASES LOCAL UTILITIES. THESE SYSTEMS PERFORM DIAGNOSTICS DETECT FAULTS AND HELP REDUCE DOWNTIME AND MAINTENANCE COSTS IT CAN ALSO INCREASE ENERGY SAVINGS ANYWHERE FROM 13266% BY OPTIMIZING EQUIPMENT SETTINGS AND TIMERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND AGAIN DEPUTY DIRECTOR- AND MYSELF WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- THANK YOU. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON NUMBER IS ILLICITLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NOTHING TO ADD BETTER HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. ANALYST. THANK YOU REYES CHURCH OF COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THESE DETAILS PROPOSALS. I'M JUST KIND OF THE WE'VE MOVED INTO THE NEW SWING SPACE- EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE ELEVATORS I HAVE FOUND MYSELF PINING FOR THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAD ELEVATOR OPERATORS. AND THE OLD SYSTEM IF YOU WILL- AGAIN BEING SOMEWHAT FACETIOUS ABOUT IT VICTOR. MODERNIZATION SOMETIMES HAS ITS DEFICIENCIES WE'RE GOING THROUGH SOME GROWING PAINS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THEN I THINK WE HAVE THE NEXT ONE WOULD BE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. THE AND WITH. FORTY TWO. I DON'T FORTY TWO MEDICARE. TELL WE'RE READY FOR YOU ALL- HELLO ARE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS AYE MAN DOWN CRAWFORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED AND I FEEL THE NEED TO DESIGNATE. OUR CULTURAL DISTRICTS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITH AB ONE EIGHTY NINE AND I'M FUNDED MANDATE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR VALUING THIS PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT THAT HE INCLUDED IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET. AND ARE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR STATE'S COHORT OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS. WITH THE B. C. REQUEST FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THE PILOT COHORT. OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS FUNDING WILL IMPACT THE CURRENT DISTRICTS AND THE EXPANDED DISTRICTS. OUR COUNCIL PROHIBITED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR ARTS COMMUNITIES STATEWIDE. THE EXPANSION OF CULTURAL DISTRICTS PRIORITIZED EQUITABLE ECONOMIC INCLUSION FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY BUILDING AND NOURISHING. CULTURAL IDENTITY AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESSES WHILE PREVENTING DISPLACEMENT. THIS IS WHAT WE DO AT THE C. A. C. WHEN THE FIRST COOPER WAS ESTABLISHED ARTS COUNCIL BEGAN BY CONDUCTING ONLINE SURVEYS INTERVIEWS. AND PUBLIC INPUT MEETINGS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE PLAN TO USE THOSE BEST PRACTICES FOR OUR PUBLIC INPUT SESSIONS AS WELL AS BORROWING FROM THE BEST PRACTICES WE'VE RECENTLY YEARS. IN DEVELOPING THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE CORE PROGRAM GUIDELINES USE LOOK UTILIZING COMMUNITY PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT ANALYSTS ANALYSTS THAT CONSISTED OF ARTISTS CULTURE BEARERS. EIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE SAID MINISTRATIONS IN THIS ADMINISTRATORS IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE BUSINESS LEADERS AND MUNICIPALITY LEADERS. FROM PRIORITY POPULATIONS THAT ARE TO BE ENGAGED. AFTER WE VISITED INITIALLY AND EVALUATED THE EXISTING FOURTEEN CULTURAL DISTRICTS.WE BELIEVE THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR OUR REACH COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN OUR CREATE A CORD DEVELOPMENTS IS A VIBRANT MODEL THAT WE CAN USE WHILE WE ROLL OUT THIS NEW COHORT AS SOON AS THE FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE FOR THE EXPANSION OF THE COVERT THE COUNCIL PLANS TO DO SITE VISITS AND WILL ASSESS THE HEALTH AND NEEDS OF THE ORIGINAL FOURTEEN DISTRICTS. WILL ALSO DO REGIONAL LISTENING TOURS PUBLIC INPUT MEETINGS OF REGIONAL COMMUNITY PANELS FORMED ON ON THE MODERATE JUST SPOKE ABOUT TO INFORM US ABOUT THE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES REGIONALLY THIS EVALUATION WILL DETERMINE HOW THE CDC CAN BEST SUPPORT THE EXISTING COHORT INCLUDING. THE AMOUNT TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTING DISTRICTS FOR STAFFING AND BRANDING. THESE FOURTEEN WILL ULTIMATELY SERVE AS MENTORS TO A NEW COHORT OF DISTRICTS AS WELL AS TO THE PLANNING DISTRICTS. IT'LL ASO INFORM THE CERTIFICATION OF TEN MORE DISTRICTS. AND WHEN I SAID PLANNING I MEAN THAT WE WOULD IDENTIFIES FIVE EMERGING DISTRICTS WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT. SO THAT THEY COULD INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY BECOME APPLICANTS FOR THE CULTURAL DISTRICT PROGRAM. DISTRICTS SO USE THE FUNDS FOR MARKETING SIGNAGE BANNERS DEVELOPER BRANDS. IRWIN HAVE CETERA IN STAFF TO COORDINATE THE NECESSARY PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ARTISTS CITY PARTNERS AND BUSINESSES. THE CRITERIA USED TO SUPPORT THE GRANTS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO REPRESENT THE TRUE COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIPS THAT EXIST ALREADY BETWEEN ARTISTS CITY PARTNERS AND BUSINESS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RACIAL EQUITY ACCESSIBILITY AND THAT NO CONFLICT EXISTS BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THE CULTURAL DISTRICT AND THE ARTISTS MAKING A LIVING. AND CONTINUING TO RESIDE IN THE AREA OF THE DISTRICT. A PANEL OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EXISTING CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND STAKEHOLDERS WILL RANK THE APPLICANTS BASED ON THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE DEVELOPED. ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO AT THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS GROUNDED IN USING A RACIAL EQUITY LANDS A GOOD EXAMPLE WITH THE WORK WE DID WITH THAT. YES THE WORK THAT WE DID WITH THE CREATIVE CORE WE INVITED REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVES MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES. WHO WOULD PERSONALLY REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE AND WORK IN THE NORTH OTHERWISE THEY HAVE BOTH FEET. IN THE REGION. WHERE THE WORK WILL BE DONE. BASED ON THE INITIAL OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE EXISTING. OUR CULTURAL DISTRICTS CHC OR EXCESS WELL ASSESS THE ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR CULTURAL DISTRICTS. ON WHAT I HAD MENTIONED BEFORE COSTIKYAN INCLUDES SIGNAGE BANNERS MARKETING ARTIST MAKERSPACE AND STAFF THAT SUPPORT PROJECT COORDINATION FUNDS WILL BE USED TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS BETWEEN BUSINESSES CITIES AND ARTIST COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP PRIDE AND STEWARDSHIP REPLACE. RAGING RETENTION OF CULTURAL ASSETS ACTIVELY WORKING TO MITIGATE DISPLACEMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND DURING THAT COHORTS- FUNDING WAS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHICH IS NOT GIVEN IN RESPONSE TO A NEED AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE WANT TO REALLY THOROUGHLY EXAMINE WHAT THE MEDIA IS OUT THERE IN THE FIELD. BY CONDUCTING OUR REGION INCORPORATING PUBLIC INPUT AS WE DEVELOP THE GUIDELINES. I'M HERE WITH- DEPUTY DIRECTOR. HE WORRY THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM CALIFORNIA CULTURAL DISTRICTS. AS WELL AS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE POETS LAUREATE PROGRAM ALTHOUGH I SEE ON THIS ITEM WE'RE- TALKING MAINLY ABOUT CULTURAL DISTRICTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND FROM FINANCE. MARK JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD ATTHIS TIME BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE GREAT THANK YOU ALEJO'S OFFICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M IS SO AS WITH THE NOTED- THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE EIGHTY SIGNIFICANT AND- I'M NOT A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM AND IN PARTICULAR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND WHILE OF THIS PROGRAM IS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTINUING A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAS BEEN A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. ON THE PROGRAM WAS HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED BEFORE AND L. AS MISS BROWN CRAWFORD INDICATED THE LEVEL OF FUNDING TO EACH DISTRICT HAS BEEN. SORT OF NOMINAL AMOUNT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY INTO THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING LEVEL IS I SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. THAN WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE PAST INTO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF SORT OF A NEW FUNDING PROGRAM. AND THE ORIGINAL PILOT PROGRAM IT DID FIND AND SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT FOURTEEN DISTRICTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED. I'M IN PARTICULAR AND THAT HE DISTRICTS- DIDN'T DIDN'T REALLY REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S RACIAL AND ETHNIC HERITAGE AND DIVERSITY- AS WELL AS- A LACKING OF CLEAR GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS. I'M FOR THE DISTRICTS AND FOR THE PROGRAM. I'M IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS POTENTIALLY PROMISING IT'S SEEKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS THAT WERE FOUND IN THE- REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF A PILOT PROGRAM- HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN KEY DETAILS OF THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT ARE STILL LACKING. IN PARTICULAR AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING DISTRICTS AND NEW CULTURAL DISTRICTS. I'M AND- SPECIFIC PARAMETERS ON THE ALLOWABLE USE OF FRIENDS AND SOME POTENTIAL FUND ALLOWABLE USES THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY- BUT THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING I'M DETAILED IN THE PROPOSAL. I'M. ABOUT HOW THAT WOULD BE DETERMINE ANNA MORE COPPER LET AT THE FUNDS MIGHT BE AWARD THE GRAN AND A- THAT GREEN TEA. I'M WHAT OF COOL AND HOW WOULD BE HONEST BY THE ARTS. AND HOW THOSE MIGHT BE MEASURE. AND ARTS COUNCIL UNIQUE HER OFFICE THAT MORE DETAILS ON THIS. WOULD BE AVAILABLE LATER IN THE SPRING DETAILS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSAL WOULD MEET THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. ON AS WELL AS ADDRESS THE ISSUES AROUND LACK OF DIVERSITY FOR THE CULTURAL DISTRICTS PROGRAM. IBM'S THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED USE THAT FUNDING WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ONE TIME FRIENDS RATHER THAN ONGOING FINDS. AND ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL UNTIL THE ARTS COUNCIL IS ABLE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THEY YOU I'M NOT GOING TO MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE VICE. WHAT TO THE TO THE CHAIR IDEA. HAVE A GREAT AFFINITY FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE. AGENCY BUT- TO THIS VERY POINT IS I'VE REVIEWED THESE CULTURAL DISTRICTS. I IN I READ THE CRITERIA PRESERVATION DESIGNATION AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACK NATIVE AMERICAN CHINESE AMERICAN CULTURE DISTRICTS IN THE NEXT COHORT. NUMBER TWO PRIORITIES DESIGNATION OF DESTRUCTION AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED OR NOT DIRECTLY FUNDED BY THE CHC. MY INTEREST IS THE RURAL COUNTIES MANY OF WHICH ARE MINORITY DOMINATED. N. THIS LIST DOES NOT SHOW VERY MUCH MONEY GOING INTO THE RURAL COUNTIES. AND I GATHER THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT IS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT IS CORRECT YEAH G. GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IS A BIG PART OF THIS AND I THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- IN AND WE CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAIL HE M. AS- WAS MENTIONED IN. BUT WE ALSO ARE VERY COMMITTED TO DOING A FIELD SCANNER THOROUGH FIELD SCANNED INTO MY ACTUALLY LISTEN AS WE DO THAT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGH ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. YOU KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME. WELL YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THE RECOVERY. THE VILLAGE TO THE RURAL COUNTIES SO MUCH OF OUR HISTORY THESE RURAL COUNTIES PHIL OF. IN THIS EVENT IN THE- DOCUMENT WE HAVE HERE JUST THE ANALYSIS. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC I READ ITEMS ONE AND TWO VERBATIM BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE AS YOU PROCEED SOMETHING ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC. DISTRIBUTIONS TO AND YOUR CONSIDERATION OF YOUR OF YOUR YOUR FUNDING FOR IF YOU'RE CULTURAL DISTRICT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT IS ONE OF THE COUNCIL'S PRIORITIES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU WE WILL ADDRESS GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY AND THAT'S AND NOW I'M AYE I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IF. I WEAR A RURAL ADVOCACY HAVE QUITE A BIT YOU DO I KNOW THAT THANK YOU. SENATOR RON NUMBER- CABALLERO. YEAH THIS IS A WHOLE DOOR OPEN ITEM SO I DO WANT TO SEE A LOT MORE DETAIL I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE LACK OF GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY APART FROM THE FACT THAT- THAT D. D. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SITE'S. IN REGARDS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS PRETTY LOPSIDED AS WELL I LOVE THE ARTS COUNCIL AYE AYE I THINK THAT- YOU HAVE A- A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE RESTRICTED EVERYBODY'S LIFE SAID HAVE BEEN. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INVOLVED IN THE ARTS IS JUST INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT- I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES AND WHEN I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS THERE WAS NOTHING IN THIS IN THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE STATE AT ALL. AND- AND MISS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE TEND. DO ARTS AND MONTEREY COUNTY PEOPLE ALWAYS GO TO THE PENINSULA BUT KING CITY AND GREENFIELD HAVE AS MUCH OF A NEED FOR OUR PROGRAMS AND WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I HAVE SO MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DESPERATE TO HAVE- ART. LOCATED IN THEIR DOWNTOWN AREA THEY THEY REALLY WANT TO BRING PEOPLE IN AND GET PEOPLE TOGETHER AT THE IN THE HEART OF SOUL OF THEIR COMMUNITY SO. I'D LIKE TO SEE- THERE BE A LITTLE BIT MORE- DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNITIES- THIS IS HEAVY ON THE COAST. AND AND THERE'S NOT MUCH MUCH INLAND SO- I'D I'D HOPEFULLY THIS IS GOING TO COME BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. HERE IS THAT. ANYMORE I'M DONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ARMS WIDE ONE AT DON'T WANNA. BE REDUNDANT BUT I TO ECHO THE SAME. CONCERNS I MEAN I COME FROM LOS ANGELES AND WHICH IS LIKE A THIRD OF THE STATE SO THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE- CULTURAL DISTRICT- IN ALL OF THAT REGION IS HAS REMAINED ASTOUNDING FOR ME- FOR AWHILE AND I AM AN INCREDIBLE SUPPORTER OF THE ARTS- I GUESS MY ONE. QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW AID SINCE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM THERE WILL BE SOME MORE DETAIL I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL BE FLESHED OUT AND SHARED ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROMOTING. SOME EQUITY IN THE SELECTION. OF- THE NEW DISTRICTS BECAUSE I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. TO GET SELECTION CRITERIA CORRECT- SO I GUESS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING THIS TIME THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT. FROM WHAT YOU DID LAST TIME- THAT RESULTED IN THESE FOURTEEN. AND THEN THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN HERE THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING AND NEW CULTURAL DISTRICTS SO. IS THERE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT BE EVALUATING AS WE DO OUR FIELD SCANNED WE- WHERE IT FIRST COHORT WAS A PILOT IT WAS UNFUNDED REAR OF LEARNED A LOT FROM IT IN WE WILL CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM THAT AND IT IS OUR GOAL WITH THIS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I CAN ADD AND- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION WE HAVE. LEARNED A LOT FROM THE FIRST COHORT AND AS AND JUST THAT THAT WAS A- AN UNFUNDED MANDATE SO WE PUT OUR- OPERATIONS MONEY INTO AND I JUST WANTED TO HELP THEM BECOME DESIGNATED. BY THE STATE AND ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT OF THE CULTURE DISTRICTS. SPRINGBOARD INTO OTHER ACTIVITIES. AND RECOGNITION IN THEIR COMMUNITY. BUT IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE IN MIND IS IF THIS IS THIS- WE ARE. ALLOWED TO SPENDING WE PLAN TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT CULTURAL DISTRICTS FIRST. THOUGH THEY'VE DONE WORK THEY'VE BEEN REPORTING TO US ABOUT HOW THEY'VE BEEN EXISTING WITH THE LIMITED FUNDING THAT THEY HAD PRIOR. HOWEVER THE STATE DESIGNATION IT'S BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL TO THEM SO WE WANT TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT HOW THE FUNDING HAS PARLAYED OTHER FINDING. AND IDENTIFYING A FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE CURRENT COHORT THEN WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY PANEL TO DEVELOP THE GRANT PROGRAM- AND IDENTIFY HOW THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO OCCUR MORE. SO THAT IT'S VERY RELEVANT POLITICAL JUST YOU NEED. WE'RE GONNA HOLD US OPEN AND WAIT FOR MORE INFORMATION. NEXT WE WILL GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY THREE- DRUG INTERDICTION EFFORTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I MET THE FIRST TIME THE DEPUTY ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT- I'M FORTY THREE TALKS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND OUR EXISTING. MILITARY DEPARTMENT KERN ARCONIC SUFFERED A SUPPORTING THE FOR HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS ACROSS OUR STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS EFFORT WILL AMPLIFY THAT BUILDING CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO- DEFEAT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND- IN LARGE MEASURE UP PUT A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN THE- IN THE CHALLENGES OUR STATE FACES RELATIVE TO. DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL METHAMPHETAMINE COCAINE HEROIN- IN THOSE TYPES OF ILLEGAL. DRUGS AND TO LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU NOW WILL FROM FINANCE. THE MEMBER OF OUR FINANCE NO COMMENTS THIS TIME BUT WILL BE ON STANDBY FOR ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU L. A. O. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ITALY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE ANALYZED A TOTAL OF NINE PROPOSALS. INCLUDING THIS ONE AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE- WE DID RAISE CONCERNS WITH SEVEN OF THEM AND RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT THAT OFFERS A BROAD FRAMEWORK FOR LEGISLATIVE DELIBERATION. AS WELL AS OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE'RE GONNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY- ON THOSE THAT RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PROPOSAL. AND SO SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THIS ONE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS PROPOSAL MAY NOT BE STRUCTURED. TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNOR'S INSPIRED OUTCOME UNTIL OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REDUCE OPIOID OPIOID OVERDOSES. AS WELL AS CRIMES AND VIOLENCE RELATED TO THE SMUGGLING AND DISTRIBUTION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. HOWEVER OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE TEND TO INVOLVE THE TARGETING OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING WHICH CAN ALSO BE A REASON WILL TAKE LIKE ALL BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME AS- ILLEGAL DRUGS RELATED LINKS. TO OVERDOSE JUST AS- IF THE STATE IS INTERESTED IN THAT GOAL OF REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED. MIGHT NOT BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO SO. MORE BROAD. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS THINKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS. SPECIFIED CLEAR OBJECTIVES TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND THEN PROVIDE THE FUNDING IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES THAT THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE ACHIEVED. SO IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT- THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY FALLS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER VARIOUS CRIME RELATED OR FIRE RELATED CALLS SO FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS DATA INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A NOTABLE INCREASE AND HOMICIDES AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. I'M A RECENT INCREASE IN MOTOR VEHICLE RELATED FAST GROWTH IN HOMICIDE FIREARM TEST AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES THAT INVOLVED FIRE- ADDITIONALLY AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY WERE STILL NEARLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ON THE STATE'S LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME PROHIBITED. FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT CRIME RATES TEND TO VARY BY REGION AS WELL AS TYPE OF CRIME SO THIS MEANS THAT WHILE A PARTICULAR CRIME MAY NOT BE OF SIGNIFICANCE CONCERNED STATEWIDE. TARGETING SPECIFIC TYPES OF CRIME IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY ARE IS TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN COULD ALSO MERIT LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. FINALLY AS AN ALTERNATIVE GIVEN ABOUT THE TOTAL CRIME RATE IS CURRENTLY QUITE LOW RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL STANDARDS THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER PRIORITIZING PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO REDUCING CRIME. SUCH AS BETTER ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL- WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOING TO START WITH A VICE CHAIR NIELSEN. WELL TO LAST COMMENT THE CRIME RATES. COMPARED TO HISTORIC ARE QUITE LOW- I TEND TO DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE NOT QUITE LOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GROWING FAST. IN IN THESE PARTICULAR AREAS PARTICULARLY NOW THAT IS NOT MY POINT. I'M ALL FOR HAVING ENGAGED THE NATIONAL GUARD. THAT SHOULD NEVER BE THEIR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE MANY OTHERS GRAHAM I THINK MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. BUT THE DEGREE THAT THE GUARD CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M ALL FOR THAT. BUT I BELIEVE AS WE- EXAMINE THIS PROPOSAL- IT NEEDS TO BE MORE DEFENDER THE REST OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN WHAT MANNER AND WAIT THEY WILL COOPERATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND WHAT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY THEIR IN- I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BE ARRESTING AND- A PROSECUTING. SO WHAT WILL BE THAT- THAT SUPPORT. THE VOTE I'M JUST REQUESTING THE LIVE. FIND MERIT IN THE PROPOSAL I COULD GET A LITTLE BIT MORE BE ON THE PHONE IF YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR SENATOR RON WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY I'VE MAYBE THE- PROPOSAL'S MIS TITLED THE- DEALING WITH CANNABIS IN ANOTHER SETTING- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THE- CANNABIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUES TO BE- OPERATING- WE CERTAINLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THE ILLEGAL. UNAUTHORIZED TO CANADA'S CANNABIS. OPERATION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE- CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT- AND THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT THAT IS CAN ASSIST US IN CRACKING DOWN ON. THIS ILLEGAL ENTERPRISES WE WORK OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CANNABIS- SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE SO IF WE NEED TO RE TITLE THIS I'M IN FAVOR OF THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PROPOSAL IS BROUGHT FORWARD COPYRIGHT. YES THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FORWARD I A. M. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH SENATOR ROSS I THINK YOU MEAN IT MAY BE JUST AN ISSUE I THOUGHT LET ME JUST SAY THAT. THAT- MY THE CONCERNS RAISED BY PUBLIC SAFETY HAVE BEEN TWO FOLD ONE IS. THE ISSUE OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING WHICH THEN LEADS TO. HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE. SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IT'S DOING THIS KIND OF- AND GROWING- SO THAT'S ONE AND ALSO THE- THE USE OF FIREARMS TO COMMIT. HIS CRIMES AND- THAT SEEMS TO BE- IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR AND SO. ANY HELP THAT WE CAN GIVE A LOCAL. ON IT EVERY SENSE OF THE MAJORITY OF MY DISTRICT- COMMUNITIES ARE. ROLE IN FAIRLY ISOLATED IN OUR- ARE- PATROLLED BY THE SHERIFF- THE LAW ENFORCEMENT GETTING THEIR AFTER THE FACT AND SIGNIFICANTLY LATER AFTER THE FACT SO ANY ASSISTANCE THAT. THEY CAN BE PROVIDED- FROM THE STATE ON THIS IS- IS REALLY I THINK- APPRECIATED SO. I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND MAYBE- INCLUDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCALS. TO TRY TO STOP SOME OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKING THAT THEN IS BRINGING THE GUNS AND- THE WEAPONS AND THAT. ASSAULTS THAT ARE HAPPENING AS WELL. THANK YOU YEAH. THAT'S IT SENATOR RON. WELL THANK YOU MANAGER JUST ONE MORE QUICK COMMENT I CAN'T RESIST- SINCE THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST WAS- MENTIONED IN. I THINK THE ALEJO'S COMMENT. A SINCE I ARRIVED IN THIS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I WAS. HERE FOR SIX YEARS BEFORE I TOOK MY SABBATICAL SABBATICAL- I'VE ASK EVERY YEAR. IN THE HERE AND ELSEWHERE. THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST IS CONSIST OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS. BECAUSE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND A CRIMINAL CONVICTION AND PERHAPS FOR SOME OTHER REASONS AND I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY AT THE TIME OF THE SENTENCING. WE ARE NOT PICKING UP THOSE FIREARMS. AND INSTEAD WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO OUT SERVE THEIR SENTENCES COME BACK PICK UP THEIR FIREARMS AND DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO. AND I'M JUST MAKING THIS COMMENT FOR THOSE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE IN THE L. A. O. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PERHAPS AT SOME POINT WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I'LL BET THAT THE COST OF PICKING UP THE FIREARM FIREARMS AT THE COURTHOUSE AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING IS LESS THAN THE MONEY. WE SPEND SENDING PEOPLE CHASING ALL OVER THE STATE TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE FOUND WITH GUNS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE. STARTED SOMETHING. BY THEIR- OWN A SOURCE POINT- WITH ISSUE IS ONE THAT WE ALSO MUST DEAL WITH WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT'S A LONG LONG STANDING. HUGE PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED SO. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE ON SEVERAL FRONTS IN THAT REGARD AND CERTAINLY IN SYMPATHY WITH. THANK YOU FOR THAT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. IF I IF I MIGHT USE- IN TERMS OF THIS IS IN ITALY WITH THE L. A. L. JUST BECAUSE THE RESPECTIVE SENATORS HAVE ALL EXPRESSED INTEREST RELATED TO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD EMPHASIZE IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES- WHEN THEY HEARD THE ISSUE ITEM RELATED TO ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE PACKAGE WHICH WAS FOR A GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM. WE HAD RAISED SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS PROGRAM BUT WE ARE ALSO OFFERED A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY TIED- TO THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED LEFT FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND JUST BRIEFLY SO THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF IT. I'M SINCE THERE IS BEST INTEREST I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THEM FOR YOU WHICH IS ONE OPTION WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD PROVIDE PREVIOUSLY AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. PROVIDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR DOJ'S DONE VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED NEED TO COUNTY SHERIFF'S THE WHOLE PRODUCE THAT LIST. BY SEIZING FIREARMS AND AMMUNITIONS FROM THEM AS OF THAT- THE LET. COULD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE PROGRAM AND ALSO MAKE OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT LAKE CITY POLICE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR THE GRANT FUNDING. DIRECTLY RELATED TO SENATOR ROCKS COMMENTS- ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE- RECOMMEND THAT WE RECOMMEND IT FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. IS IT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LIMIT THE GROWTH OF THE LAST- IT COULD MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT FIREARMS ARE RELINQUISH. AT THE TIME INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING THROUGH THOSE COURT PROCEEDINGS THAT ULTIMATELY PROHIBIT THEM FROM OWNING THEM. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE TO THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOUNG. PERFECT THERE WE GO WELL AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING REDUNDANT- YOU KNOW I TO I'M HOPING THAT. WHEN THIS COMES BACK BEFORE US THAT THERE'S A LITTLE MORE MEAT ON THE BONES- AND HOPEFULLY TO DELINEATE YOU KNOW FUNDING THAT IS REQUESTED THAT CAN HELP IN THE COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES. TO HELP YOU WITH SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE HOPING TO SEE COME TO FRUITION I TO SORT OF QUESTION ALL THE TIME IS SPENT IN THE CANNABIS SPACE BECAUSE IT IS LEGAL AND ONE OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD. ABOUT SORT OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AS IT RELATES TO CANNABIS IS WATER FAST- AND BUT I AM A SUSPECTING THAT- THAT'S NOT INCORPORATED IN IN THIS PROPOSAL- AND ALSO HOW THE SOME OF THE ILLEGAL CULTIVATION ACTIVITIES ARE CONNECTED WITH INTERNATIONAL CARTELS WHO ARE DOING OTHER THINGS. SOME OF IT IS- TRAFFICKING OF WEAPONS- AND YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD PROBABLY BE WISE TO KIND OF THINK- A LITTLE BIT MORE- ABOUT. HOW TO. IMPACT THE FEDERAL ISSUE WHICH I SEE IS ALSO LISTED IN HERE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TAKING UP A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME. IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- EVEN THOUGH IT IS COMPLICATED BY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY OVER SUBSCRIBED SO QUESTION IS HOW IS CMG GOING TO PRIORITIZE- WHICH REQUESTS- IT FOCUSES ON. I'M SURE I THINK- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- WE USE THE BEFORE HIGH INTENSITY DRUG TRAFFICKING AREAS- IN OUR STATE. WHICH NAY ARE A- A FUSION SELLER BODY IF YOU WILL THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY STATE FEDERAL LOCAL TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SET PRIORITIES FOR SPECIFIC AREAS WITHIN OUR OUR STATE AND WE USE- THOSE HEIGHT IS TO INFORM. HOW WE- PROVIDE SUPPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- TO- THAT ARE THIS IS WHAT WE DO RELATIVE TO CANNABIS YOU MADE THOSE POINTS. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE NATIONAL STATE FORCE ACROSS OUR STATE. WHERE YOU HAVE- INDUSTRIAL SIZED CARTEL SPONSORED ILLEGAL OUTDOOR CANNABIS GROWS- THAT AS YOU MENTIONED NOT ONLY DESTROY THE ECOLOGY OF OUR GREAT STATE BUT ALSO STEAL WATER I THINK IT TAKES A POINT FIVE GALLONS OF WATER A DAY KEEP AN OUTDOOR CANNABIS PLANT AND ILLEGAL OUTDOOR CANNABIS PLANT GOING SHOULD YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE MEGA DROUGHT THAT WE ARE IN NOW. ALL THAT WATER BEING DIVERTED TO SHOOT ILLEGAL INDUSTRIAL SIZE CARTEL GROUPS AND W'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT WE SPENT AN EXCEPTIONAL AMOUNT OF TIME. WORKING ON ON THAT CHALLENGE YOUR POINT ABOUT THAT MOMENT AND IN COCAINE AND OTHERS WE'VE SEEN UP WE'VE SUPPORTED SEIZURES OVER LAST YEAR SO. FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE- ARE SUPPORTS TWO PHENYL SEIZURES HAVE GONE UP TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. SO THE WORK THAT WE CAN DO RELATIVE TO THIS- THIS REQUEST WILL ONLY. EXPAND OUR CAPABILITY TO GET MORE OF THOSE. ILLEGAL DRUGS OFF THE STREET. THANK THANK YOU- WE'RE GONNA HOLD US OVER AND ON NOW TO I NUMBER FORTY FOUR ENHANCING AND EXPANDING FIRE CREWS TASK FORCE RATTLESNAKE WHAT AN UNFORTUNATE NAME. FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE SNAKES. YEAH I DON'T LIKE SNAKES EITHER BUT- THAT THE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN THAT- DO THE WORK THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE AND SO THEY'RE DOING THE WORK THEY GET TO NAME THE TASK. THAT'S TRUE. SO SO THIS REQUEST IS THAT PER FIFTEENS DIRECT DO POSITIONS AT THIRTY NINE POINT NINE ONE YEAR. OF FORTY THREE POINT ONE ON GOING. AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO CONVERT- OUR OUR FUELS MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT KIDS ARE OUT- CLEARING THE- COMBUSTIBLE FUELS ACROSS OUR STATE LANDS. IT'S GOING TO CONVERT- THAT WORK WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE- AND BEING FUNDED BY- FEMA. CHU AT THE STATE FUNDING ONGOING STATE FUNDING. AT THE EXPECT THE- THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO EXPIRE. AT THE END OF OUR CURRENT STATE FISCAL YEAR THIRTY THIRTY JAN. AND THAT SAID THAT'S WHY WE'RE COMING TO YOU WITH THIS REQUEST SO GIVE US ESSENTIALLY FOURTEEN. TYPE ONE- WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING INCREASE THAT NOT ONLY WILL DO FEELS MANAGEMENT. BUT ALSO SUPPORT CAL FIRE AND I SUPPORT IT ALSO THAT THIS- THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THIS WORK ON OUR BEHALF OR DOING IT- UNDER THE SUPERVISION AUSPICES OF CAL FIRE. GREAT FORTY YOUR QUESTIONS PERFECT OKAY. WEBER GOVERNMENT FINANCES THAT L. A. L. THE COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IS SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS TO WITH AN EXPANDING AND THE AND CONTINUING THE TASK FORCE'S RATTLESNAKE CREATED JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT MADAM CHAIR THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR CAN CRUISE ON A SEASONAL BASIS- AND THEN FEDERAL FUNDING CAME AND NOT ALLOW THAT SORT OF SUPPLANTED THE STATE FINDS AND ALLOW. IT TASK FORCE ROSS NAY CREASE TO EXPAND- AS WELL AS CONTINUING THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FURTHER EXPAND TO A TOTAL OF FOURTEEN HAND CHRIS WITH NO DAMAGE AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT BUT WHEN AS WAS NOTED AND- HOW FIRE WILL BE AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPERVISING THESE CRASHES. THE CURRENT FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDED A CAL FIRE AND DOWNTURN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL FUNDING WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS HOWEVER THERE WILL BE COSTS ON THE CAL FIRE SIDE ON IN ORDER TO SUPPORT AND SUPERVISE THESE CHRIS. THAT COSTS FOR CALIFORNICA BUDGET IN A PROPOSAL FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL FIRE WHERE THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN- I. T. HELP PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE I'M AND THIS IS SORT OF PART OF THAT LARGER WILDFIRE RESPONSE PACKAGE AS WELL ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN HEARD ON IN OTHER SUB COMMITTEES AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND CONSIDER THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR OVERALL PRIORITIES FOR WHAT. YOUR RESPONSE- AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE CAL FIRE PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL COST OF SUPPORTING THESE FOURTEEN CREE IS ON AN ONGOING BASIS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU- SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'M GONNA START ONCE AGAIN WITH MY VICE CHAIR SENATOR NIELSEN. OKAY GREAT SENATOR ROB QUICK- IT IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT CAL FIRE- FUNDING. IN ADDITION IN. ALONG WITH THIS TELL ME WHAT. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE DOUBLE SUPERVISION ONE FROM THE- MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND THEN ALSO FROM FROM A CAL FIRE. THAT MAY BE OPERATIONALLY HOW YOU WE NORMALLY OPERATE- SO- I APOLOGIZE FOR MY IGNORANCE. I KNOW SENATOR THAT THAT YOUR YOUR SPOT ON IT SO CAL FIRE DATE WITH THE SUPERVISOR ESSENTIALLY TELL OUR OUR SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO WHAT TO DO HOW TO DO IT THEY PROVIDE THE TACTICAL EXECUTION OF IT- ALONG THOSE LINES. SINCE WE HAVE WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW A CLUSTER OF FOUR HUNDRED FOLKS- OUT IN THE FIELD IT REQUIRES- CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD TO ENSURE THAT THE UNIQUE- PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS HEY ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT BACK IN SUPPORT- VEHICLES IF YOU WILL ALL THE EQUIPMENT- IS MANAGED APPROPRIATELY THAT'S WITH THE POSITIONS FOR THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL TACTICAL EXECUTION IS SUPERVISED BY. BY CAL FIRE BUT WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR SOLDIERS NEAR MY CROPS YOU'LL- FIND IT THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU ARE YOU KNOW I HAVEA QUESTION I THINK FOR L. A. WE'VE HEARD SOME- WE'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS FROM COUNTIES AT THIS PROPOSAL MAY VIOLATE PROP ONE EIGHTY- IS THAT TRUE. ARE WE ALL RIGHT WE HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM COUNTY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO AND- CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU IN YOUR OFFICE AND I WOULD. GET SOME MORE INFORMATION FOR YOU ON THAT. OKAY GREAT I DON'T OFTEN ANSWERS ANYTHING. NICE TO MILLION ARE THAT BUT ALL OF THE FACTS WERE FOLKS OKAY GREAT. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE OVER TO ISSUE NUMBER FORTY FIVE. INSUFFICIENT EDUCATION REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUN BACK FILLS. AND WHO DO WE HAVE. THE NEW RIDLEY THOMAS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'LL BE PRESENTED THIS ITEM PERFECT. SO AT A HIGH LEVEL THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES TWO THINGS IT CREATES A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR COUNTIES TO SUBMIT CLAIMS THERE WAS THE TIME BACK THOSE FINANCES MISSION ERA. AND ALSO ADDRESSES AN ISSUE IN WHICH SCHOOLS ARE LOSING OUT ON ABOUT A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUEPER YEAR WHILE PROVIDING A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS TO ENSURE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE REIMBURSED FOR THE YELLOW BOX. SO BEFORE I GET INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE THREE DRIVING FACTORS BEHIND THIS EACH. THE FIRST IS THE ENGINE. REVENUE AUGMENTATION FONG OR THE EGRESS. YOU ARE STATUES WERE ENACTED IN THE EARLY NINETIES. THIS YEAR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FROM CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE CAKE AND FOURTEEN SCHOOLS. THERE IS ANY REFERENCE EACH COUNTY IN EUROPE CAN ONLY GO TO THE NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS. THE SECOND FACTOR IS THAT I AM IN BETWEEN THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEES WHILE ON THE VLF SWAP IN HIS VISION THE REST. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE RATE WAS REDUCED FROM 2% TWO POINT SIX FIVE PERCENT. THE BACK FEEL THAT LOST REVENUE FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. STATUTE WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO REITERATE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE REVENUE FROM E. REF. BACK TO THE CITIES AND TOWNS. THIS IS CALLED THE BLS WALL. IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE RAF TO PAY FOR THE BILL THAT'S WHAT. THE DIFFERENCE IS MADE UP BY SHIP IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. FROM NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS THE DISEASE ACCOUNTS. IF THERE STILL ISN'T ENOUGH REVENUE FOR THE MEAL OF SWAP AFTER SHIPPING IS REVENUE FROM THE SCHOOLS. INSUFFICIENTLY RECORDS. THERE'S IMPORTANT THING KEEP IN MY- AND HOW DOES REVENUE JUST THANKS. BY WHO FUNDING. THE STATE BANK THE SHOW RHODE HUNDRED. TWO THREE F. NINETY EIGHT. HOWEVER I TEST ONE OF THE PROBLEMS NINETY EIGHT. WHICH IS BEEN OPERATIVE SINCE EIGHTEEN MY- AND BE OFFERED TO FOR THE- FUTURE. THAT SHIFT DEPARTMENT SIX REVENUE IS NOT BACK FEEL WHILE STATE SO WAS THE REVENUE LOSS WITH THE SCHOOL. THE LAST IS A SAY READ. EXCESS RENTAL CARS WHEN YOU. CANNOT BE SLOWLY MANY BASIC A SCHOOLS. THANKS AS HE WRAPPED HIS RETURN TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. UNDER CURRENT LAW EXISTS YEAR ROUND CANNOT BE COUNTY FORCE THE BLS WALK PAID. ALL RIGHT AND I WILL GET INTO THE PROPOSED. THIS ONE IS TWELVE THIRTEEN THE STATE HAS PROVIDED THIRTY THREE MILLION AS ADDITION HERE AFFECTS FEELS ANOTHER NINETY SIX MILLION IS PROPOSALS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND I JUST KNOW THAT THESE BACK FEELS ARE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW. CURRENTLY CLAIMS ARE PAID TWO YEARS IN ARREARS. WHICH MEANS THE COUNTIES IN CURRENTLY INSUFFICIENT YOU REVEREND ONE FISCAL YEAR AND THEN I RECEIVE A BACK FEEL TO FISCAL YEARS LATER. THIS KILEY BILL LANGUAGE CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR COUNTIES TO BE PAID WITHIN THE YEAR AND WISH TO INSUFFICIENT YOU WRAP WILL OCCUR. IT ALSO CREATES A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION FULMINATE THE NEED FOR A ONE TIME BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS EVERY YEAR AND TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY AROUND THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. FINALLY THIS TROUBLING REMAINS. TO REQUIRE X. THIS YEAR. TO THE LOS TO BE ABLE TO SWAP COSTS WHICH- WAS RESULT IN MORE. FOR SCHOOLS. THAT FAIL BE LESS PROPERTY TAXES ABOUT WHERE BUT- BASIC. EIGHT THIS COULD MY PRESENCE I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE HUGHES HUMOR ME AND WE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW HOW CITY WHEN I WAS A TASK THAT WAS ATTACHED NUMBER HERE FROM ALEJO BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES SORRY MY BAD MISS TIFFANY HELLO. AFTERNOON NO THAT'S MORE OR LESS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A PROCESS TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE STATE GENERAL FUND TO BACK THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THERE IS INSUFFICIENT IRAQ TO ADDRESS THE BLS WALK. ADDITIONALLY IF YOU MENTION PROPOSES TO OFFSET THE STATE GENERAL FUND BACK THE LOOK ACCESS THE RAF BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. ULTIMATELY IT IS UNIQUE HAVE BOTH INSUFFICIENT IRAQ TO ADDRESS THE BLS SPOT AND AXISDIRECT AFTER THE STATE SHARE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IT'S MATT. ACCESS IRAQI A SPECIAL FISCAL ALLOWANCE CURRENTLY BENEFITS FIVE COUNTIES. AND EXIST BECAUSE THEIR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS VERY HIGH RELATIVE TO THE STATUTORY FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR COUNTIES WITHOUT EXCESS EVEN AFTER THE FACT- PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD. CONSISTENT HIGHER LEE A STATE GENERAL FUND. IN OF PROPOSED BY THE END OF THE MINUTE. MAKES AS A PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REIMBURSEMENTS MORE QUICKLY THAN THE CURRENT PROCESS AND STREAMLINES THE PROCESS FOR CLEANING A BACK FILL. UNDER CURRENT PRACTICE STATE GENERAL FUND IS PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH AN ANNUAL BUDGET ACT ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THE COVER IN DIVISION II RAF THE BACKFILL IS PROVIDED IN ARREARS SHORTFALL HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN PAST YEARS THE GROWING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COMBINED WITH MORE BASIC IT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AS INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AND PRODUCTION SYSTEM CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE SHORT. I TO IN THE BACK MEETING WORK HAVE A LOOK GOVERNMENT TO MANAGE. AT THE BACK FILAMENTS GROW SINCE THE ELECTION IMPORTANT SOURCE OF GENERAL PURPOSE LOCAL REVENUE. FIND THE PROPOSED TO BE OUT MAKES A STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING AS WELL AS AUDITING CLAIMS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR INSUFFICIENT IRAQ. UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS DO YOU HAVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING CLAIMS. SCO DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY CURRENTLY- OR THAT SORT OF POLICY EXPERTISE TO REVIEW AND APPROVE YOUR ROTH CLAIMS. AND IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP THIS EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY AND THAT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY ARE AS TO THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THAT ROLE. TYPICALLY I FEEL MAKES PAYMENTS TO COUNTIES BASED ON DIRECTION PROVIDED TO THEM BY OTHER STATE ENTITIES THAT ADMINISTER RELEVANT PROGRAMS. WE ARE CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE ENTITY WITH THE BEST POSITION TRIBUNE APPROVE THESE CLAIMS SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE AND I START WITH MY. PRESSURE SENATOR NELSON SENSITIVE AREA GO BACK. SEVERAL YEARS. AND WE'VE RECEIVED OFTEN FROM OF C. SACK FROM THE ROOT THE LEADER CITY URBAN COUNTIES GENERAL COUNTY RIGHT. AS WELL SO IT'S A BROAD BASE OF- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN HOW WE ANALYZE THIS. THAT THAT'S ALL ALL RIGHT SO HER RUN. WELL AT THE RISK OF ASKING A QUESTION TO GET AND GETTING AN ANSWER WON'T UNDERSTAND LET ME JUST OF. THE ANALYSIS NOTES SEVERAL COUNTIES AND CITIES I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS REFERRING TO OPPOSE A PROVISION REQUIRING EXCESS YOU REF REVENUES TO FIRST BACK FILL. THE VLF INSUFFICIENCY CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME WHY. I CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THAT RESULTS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. UNDER CURRENT LAW IN IN IN THE COUNTY. THE FIRST DRAW TO REIMBURSE THE CITY OR COUNTY OR THEIR- VEHICLE LICENSE FEES WHILE REVENUES THE REVENUES A LOSS OF THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE WAS REDUCED. RECALL THAT REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISM THE BLS LAW. YOUR FIRST DRAW FOR THE REAL BILL OF SWAP IS THE RAF. AND THEIR SECURITY INTERESTS CURRENT LAW THAT SAYS. IF YOU HAVE SO MANY BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS WHICH ARE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE ROUTE IF YOU HAVE SO MANY BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS IN YOUR COUNTY. BASICALLY IT SCHOOLS CAN GET HE ROUTE SO THAT MONEY JUST COMES BACK FROM THE RAF AUTOMATICALLY TO THE DONOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. CURRENT LAW SAYS THAT MONEY THAT IS RETURNED ON THE NATURAL SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE ABSORBED BY BASIC AND SCHOOLS DOES NOT COUNT TOWARDS ALL SITTING HERE PLS WALK COSTS FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY. AND EVERY OTHER COUNTY THE MONEY THAT COMES FROM THE RAF DOES COUNT TOWARDS THAT BUT IT DOESN'T IN THESE. ACCESS IRAQ COUNTIES WHICH THERE ARE FIVE. AND OUR TRAILER BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE ANOMALY. AND THE THOUGHT IS THAT THEY WOULD GET. THAT THOSE COUNTIES AND BASS. THOSE BASIC AID COUNTIES. OR BASIC KIDS SCHOOLS COUNTIES THAT HAVE BASE HIT SCHOOLS CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD GET MORE MONEY BECAUSE THEY GET BOTH A GENERAL FUND AND THE E. RO. WELL WE THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS LET'S LET'S SAY THERE'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ACCESS THE RAPIDS BILLS BACK TO OF. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOT COUNT TOWARDS YOUR BLS WALK OSTRACISM BUT INSTEAD HAPPENS THE COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER GO TO THE- NON BASIC AID SCHOOLS WHICH TO RECEIVE STATE GENERAL FUND. AND TAKES FROM THEM ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GIVES OUT TO THE SCHOOLS- AND GIVE THAT TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO REIMBURSE ARE REALISTS LAW. SO IN ESSENCE WHAT'S HAPPENING THESE ACCESS NEARMAP COUNTIES IS PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS BEING TAKEN FROM THE NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS. TO REIMBURSE THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES. AND UNDER TEST ONE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ACTUALLY HAS A VERY ARTIFACT AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT WINDS UP IN EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE. LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THAT. BECAUSE UNDER TEST ONE. THERE'S A FIXED PART OF ABOUT 38% OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND IT GOES TO THE SCHOOLS. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS GOING BACK TO MY EXAMPLE THAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS TAKEN FROM THE SCHOOLS. AND GIVEN TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK FIELD FROM THAT X. HOT OF. 38% OF GENERAL FUND FOR THEIR BALLOTS. AND SO THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS COMES OUT OF THE POT AND GOES TO THE COUNTY SCHOOLS IN THAT COUNTY. AND THAT MEANS EVERY OTHER SCHOOL IN THE STATE HAS LOST ACCESS THAT ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THANK YOU ANOTHER. YOU SAID IT'S A HAS A STATEWIDE AFFECTED WERE SEEKING TO ADDRESS. WELL I APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION BUT THANK pSTICKING AROUND LONG ENOUGH IS YOU UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE I REMEMBER. HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT YEAR AFTER THE VLF FOR THE TRIPLE FLIP AND ALL THIS STUFF AND I JUST KEPT SAYING DON'T DO IT- IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO FIX THIS GOING FORWARD. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THESE- GYMNASTICS IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FURTHER YOU GET AWAY FROM. FROM THE- THE CRAZINESSOF THE NINETIES AND THE SHIFTING OF FUNDS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE AND FROM COUNTIES TO CITIES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE STILL DOING THIS. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE EXPLANATION BY THE WAY BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BUT IT IT'S- JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE OUGHT TO DO A SIMPLER PROCESS. AND I KNOW THAT THEN SOMEBODY'S SOMEBODY'S- LOSES SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET BUT IS THERE A WAY FOR US TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND PART OF IT IS THE DRIVES ME CRAZY IS WE MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ARE WE ASK. COUNTIES WAY BACK IN THE DAY. TIM TO MAKE AN ELECTION. TO RECEIVE MONEY BASED ON THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN THE COUNTY AT THAT TIME. AND THOSE THINGS ARE NO LONGERAPPLICABLE AND YET THEY'RE STUCK MY FAMILY TO COUNTY GETS A LOT LESS. THAN THEY ARE REALLY ENTITLED TO BECAUSE OF DECISIONS THEY MADE EARLY. EARLY ON IN IN- IN THEIR BUDGETING PROCESS. SO I HEAR REPEATEDLY THAT THEY'RE STILL UNDER FOR UNDERFUNDED IS COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES. E. L. F. UNDER PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUE TO GET DISPROPORTIONATE TO WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. EIGHT OR SEVENTY NINE SO IF YOU'RE A COUNTY THAT DIDN'T LEVY HIGH PROPERTY TAX YOU'RE STILL LIVING WITH THE REPLICATIONS OF THAT TO THE STATE OF UPSTREAM. RIGHT NO PLANS TO KIND OF FIX THIS. WELL I YEAH I THINK THAT TO ADDRESS PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WOULD. YEAH IT CREATES SO MANY WINNERS AND LOSERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT I THINK COULD BE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT THE RESULT IN MASSIVE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE SHIFTS BETWEEN A MULTITUDE OF LOCAL AGENCIES IN EACH COUNTY. GOT IT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD TO GO BACK TO PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PEOPLE START TO ADD. THAT'S ALL I GOT MEDICARE. THAT'S THE WAY IT ENDED UP FROM THIRTEEN PERCENT IT ALL DOWN HI I HAVE I HAVE NO QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL BEEN ASKED BUT WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I INCORRECTLY ASKED ABOUT THE VIOLATION OF PROP ONE EIGHTY TWO THE LAST PANEL AND IT WAS ACTUALLY FOR THIS PANEL BUT THAT GOT IT DRESSED IN THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BY SENATOR ROB- SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT ISSUE ITEM NUMBER FORTY SIX THE COW KIDS.
