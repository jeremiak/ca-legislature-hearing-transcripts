00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.365
NONETHELESS IT SEEMS LIKELY

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.265
THAT MANY OF THE ELIGIBLE

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.567

INDUSTRIES ALONE IN THE STATE.

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.677

ED IN JUST THE FIRST ROUND. IN

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.720
ADDITION TARGETING COULD LIMIT

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.656
DUPLICATION- THEY'RE TARGETING

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.557
TO LIMIT DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.159
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SO. THE

FEDERAL PROGRAMS- ARE NOT

MAY BE INELIGIBLE FOR. THE

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:48.707
FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND SO THE

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.976
STATE COULD TARGET THE MOST AND

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:53.612
IMPACTED IN. INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:55.681
MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:57.482
PROGRAMS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:59.017
BETTER TARGETING NOW THE

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.686
CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:06.258
DOES INCLUDE- TARGETING. AND-

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.794
THAT SHOULD BE ON UNDERLINE- WE

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.328
DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IT'S IN

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:11.963
FACT THIS EFFECTIVENESS AND

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.065
CLEAR AS WE HAVEN'T HAD AN

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:14.966
OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ANY- OF

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.868
THE AGGRESSIVE BEEN AWARDED OR

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:21.707
THE DETAILS OF THE CONTRACT. SO.

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.675
IN ADDITION- BECAUSE BECAUSE WE

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:25.477
ARE FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY HOW

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:26.912
THESE OTHER SPARTANS BEING RUN.

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.014
ON BASED ON COMMISSION THAT'S

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.515
BEEN PROVIDED TO US TODAY. WE

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:31.483
DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.418
ABOUT HOW AND WHETHER THE STATE

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.153
OR THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR. WILL

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.521
VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.623
INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.226
BY THE APPLICANTS IN PLACE- YOU

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.829
KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT PROCESS

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:44.362
HE'S BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:47.466
DETECT FRAUD. SO I'M LOOKING

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:50.635
FORWARD- WE THINK THE

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:51.770
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.205
PROVIDING ONE TIME FINANCIAL

00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:55.006
RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.208
AND NONPROFITS THAT WERE

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:56.908
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:59.544
PANDEMIC PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.314
CAN BE APPROPRIATELY TARGETED.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.582
AND WHETHER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.250
PROPOSALS THE BEST WAY TO DO SO

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.652
IS NOT YET CLEAR- YOU KNOW THE

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.688
INITIAL TIME AND PROCESS FOR

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:10.822
AWARDING THE GRANTS WAS

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:13.825
ARGUABLY JUSTIFIED GIVEN THE

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:14.392
PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.128
CONTEXT OF THE TIME. ON THE

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:16.895
OTHER HAND WITH THE FEDERAL

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:18.563
GOVERNMENT RECENTLY MAKING A

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.232
SECOND ROUND OF TPG LOANS

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:22.134

FURTHER ASSISTANCE FORTHCOMING

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.104
YOU THINK IT MAY BE PRUDENT FOR

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.906
THE LEGISLATURE TO DEFER ACTION.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.341
ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:29.941
UNTIL THE FOLLOWING STEPS CAN

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:34.179
BE TAKEN. FIRST WE UNDERSTAND

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.714
DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON THIS

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:36.715
PROGRAM BUT IT HASN'T BEEN

THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC

00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.486
AT LARGE SO WE THINK THIS ON

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.021
INFORMATION BUT ONLY NEEDS TO

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.790

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.561
TO FIND WAYS TO. IMPROVE THE

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:50.896
PROGRAM ALTHOUGH IT IS-

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:51.763
REASSURING TO HEAR THAT THE

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.833
CONTINUALLY MAKING IMPROVEMENTS

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.134
BASED ON ON THE DATA BUT

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.136
BECAUSE TO BRING IN- PARTNERS

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:01.273

THAT IS HAPPENING BUT- WE

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.678
HAVEN'T REALLY. BEEN INVOLVED

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:09.347

THIRD PARTY VENDORS PROCESSES

ARE THEY ABLE TO- TO DO THAT-

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:41.446
QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY AND

DIFFERENCES AMONG. DIFFERENT

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:51.523
SECTORS OR SHOULD CONTINUE TO

APPLY A SINGLE DEFINITION OF.

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:54.426
ARE CURRENTLY IT'S TWO POINT

FOURTH SHOULD THE GRANT BE

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:05.704
COUNTED AS TAXABLE INCOME SO

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.972
WITHOUT ACTION THESE GRANTS

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.006
WILL BE COUNTED AS TAX ONE

COMPORT STATE TAX PURPOSES

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.109
HOWEVER WE DO UNDERSTAND THE

LANGUAGE TO MAKE THESE TAX

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.250
EXEMPT. AND LASTLY- WE QUESTION

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.784
THE NEED FOR A SET ASIDE ONLY

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.519
FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.955
UNDOUBTEDLY MUSEUMS AND OTHER

CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE AMONG

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.391
THE MOST IMPACTED ENTITIES BUT

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.093
AS SUCH. IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.861
THEY WOULD NECESSARILY ADDED

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.329
THAT THEY WOULD RISE TO THE TOP

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:34.833
AND- PROGRAM WHICH IS. BASED ON

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.601
NEED SO IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:38.503
ON THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.304
DOLLARS IS THE APPROPRIATE

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.906
AMOUNT OR- THAT THERE'S A

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:42.908
SPECIFIC NEED FOR A SET ASIDE.

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:43.975

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.701
IS WHAT THE STATE'S CAPACITY

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:50.402
COULD HANDLE OF COURSE THERE'S

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:55.106
NO- THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:58.543
THEMSELVES. FURTHER WITH THE

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.213
NUMBERS ARE. ARE NOT BASED ON

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.816
THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:07.685
OR A PROJECTION IT WAS IT'S

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.487
REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.889
SOME RESOURCES I GUESS I'M

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.858
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WON'T IT

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.360
IT THE IN TOTAL IT'S A LITTLE

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:17.662
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND I'M

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.531
I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF. A

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:21.099
BILLION TWO BILLION THREE

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.200
BILLION IS THE APPROPRIATE

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.535
NUMBER NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.836
TWO IS WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH THE

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:26.538
GRANT PROGRAM YOU GO OUT WITH

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.973
YOU YOU SET UP EXPECTATIONS AND

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.810
I'M WONDERING IF- IF YOU KNOW

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:34.012
WE TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:36.681
IN TERMS OF THEIR OF THE

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:37.649
NUMBERS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:38.716
AND I GUESS WHAT I REALLY WANT

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.018
TO DO IS TO SAY HOW DO WE GET

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:43.788
IT RIGHT SIZED- GIVEN. ALL THE

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:44.522
OTHER OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:46.357
HERE AT THE STATE. AND THE

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:47.525
DEMANDS ON THE MONEY WHICH WE

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:48.426
KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:51.830
INTENSE. BUT I I'M I. I GUESS

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:54.466
WHAT IWANT TO OF AVOID. IS WE

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.234
KNEW THAT THE MONEY THAT WE PUT

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:58.269
OUT FOR UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS IS

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.771
GOING TO BE INSUFFICIENT- AND

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.439
SO IT SETS UP EXPECTATIONS AND

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.408
THEN 10% OF THE POPULATION GETS

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.043
A CHECK IN THE RESTAURANT AND

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.744
I'M TRYING TO AVOID. TRYING TO

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:08.379
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT.

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:10.048
CALCULATION GIVEN WHERE WE'RE

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.617
AT RIGHT NOW AND MOVING THIS

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.285
PROGRAM FORWARD. YES I MEAN WE

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:15.320
KNEW THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:17.188
INSUFFICIENT. AS DEMONSTRATED

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.890
BY THE DEMAND EVEN AND RON WENT

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.959
ALONG AND SO. THEY'RE FOUR

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:22.861
POINT ONE BUSINESSES IF YOU HAD

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.129
IN THE NUMBER. WHICH ARE

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:25.897
ALLEGED FIVE WILL C. THREES AND

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:29.000
SEE SIX IS A BETTER. THERE ARE

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:32.403
AND YOU KNOW AT LEAST FORTY. SO

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.905
CLEARLY THIS IS AN AND OF THOSE

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:35.340
OF COURSE REAL. AT TO FIVE AND-

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:37.609
AN HIGHLY IN- THIS WAS NO

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:41.146
ENOUGH. TO MEET. BUT IT WAS A

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:44.649
HOPE TRY TO STAY. MANY INTEND

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:47.552
UP TO. OF THE DEMAND- IF HE'S A-

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.787

PERFORMANCE MUSEUM THINGS LIKE

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:18.882
THAT WHICH WE KNOW. IF WE TAKE

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:20.117
IF WE COMPARE TO RESTAURANTS

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:22.619
WHILE RESTAURANTS AND BARS WERE

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:26.189
SERIOUSLY IMPACTED. MANY COULD

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.658
STILL OPERATE TO A DEGREE WITH

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.294
TO GO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE S.

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.296
PERFORMANCE VENUES MUSEUMS AND

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.132
ALL THAT HAD TO CLOSE

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:37.634
COMPLETELY AND MOST OF NOT

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.537
OPERATED AT ALL SINCE MARCH. SO

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:46.042

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:09.433
FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFIC DATA ON

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.201
THAT- I KNOW THAT THAT YES

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:13.370
THERE WERE MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:15.338
IN INCLUDING- YOU KNOW MANY

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.841
NONPROFITS SERVED- WITHIN THAT

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:19.643
CATEGORY BUT I HAVE TO FOLLOW

LIKE REGULAR BUSINESS NONPROFIT

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:26.116
IS A HUGE CATEGORY NONPROFIT

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:28.785
COULD MEAN. ANY ANY NUMBER OF

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.587
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:51:30.654 --> 00:51:33.757
PERFORMANCE OR CULTURAL.

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:36.526
OPERATIONS SO I GUESS WHAT I'M

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:37.093
REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.796
THIS- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:44.367
TARGETING IMPACTED INDUSTRIES

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:44.968
THIS IS WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:47.871
A HANDLE AT- ARE WE DO WE HAVE

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:50.674
CRITERIA. THAT TARGETS THOSE

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.543
THAT HAVE HAD. TO EXPERIENCE

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.679
FAR MORE SUBSTANTIAL OR

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.380
SIGNIFICANT AND OFTEN USING

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.249
DIFFERENT WORDS THAT CLOSURES

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.384
OR DROP IN OPERATIONS THAN

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:05.355
OTHERS. WE WERE TKING INTO

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.891
ACCOUNT THE BLUEPRINTS- YOUR

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.459
FIRST SAFELY REOPENING AS WELL

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.428
AS SARAH IT IS WELL IT'S JUST

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.296
YOUR GRAPHIC INDUSTRY IMPACT

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.632
WHEN WE WHEN WE PRIORITIZE

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.734
BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS TO BE

00:52:17.801 --> 00:52:21.271
SERVED. OKAY WELL LOOKING AT

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:23.940
THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRST ROUND

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:26.643
IN OBVIOUSLY SO MUCH LARGER

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.578
THAN WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE AND

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:35.051
EVEN IF WE ACT AND- ME EVEN.

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:37.821
THE REQUESTED NOW IS ALREADY

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:40.056
LOWER THAN WHAT WE KNOW THE

00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:41.491
DEMAND WHETHER THAT WHETHER

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:42.859
DEMAND THE NEED- EXACTLY THE

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:45.228
SAME I'M NOT GONNA QUITE YET

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:49.199
BUT- IF I JUST TAKE DEMAND. SO

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.902
ASSUMING THAT THERE IS GREATER

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:54.971
NEED. THAN THE FUNDS THAT WERE

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.773
NOW TALKING ABOUT BEING MADE

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.709
AVAILABLE. HOW IS IT THAT WE

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:03.480
CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE MOST

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:06.483
IMPACTED FINANCIALLY ARE BEING

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:10.253
ABLE TO ACCESS THESE GRANTS.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.822
YEAH A LOT OF IT THAT I THINK

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.824
IS DRIVEN BY THE OUTRAGE AND

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.826
THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE THAT WE

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:19.029
CONDUCT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:19.996
WEEKS THE SECOND ROUND

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.731
DISCOVERY SECOND THROUGH A IN

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:23.633
ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE AWARDED-

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.101
CONTINUING TO ADD ON INTO

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:27.604
FUTURE ROUNDS- I DON'T KNOW IF

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.306
THAT'S ALONE I MEAN OBVIOUSLY

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:30.640
OUR REACH IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.375
THE CRITERIA ADDITION RIGHT I

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.877
THINK THAT'S HE QUESTION WHEN

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.911
WE USE THE WORDS LIKE

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.513
TRANSPARENCY WHAT WE'RE REALLY

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.515
MEANING IT I THINK MAYBE

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:39.249
SOMEBODY ELSE MEANS SOMETHING

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:42.586
ELSE BUT- IS WHAT. ARE THE

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:44.654
CRITERIA. YES SENATOR I AGREE

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:46.056
AND DOES NOT WAS GOING TO BE

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.157
THE SECOND POINT WAS IN

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.625
ADDITION- THE WAY THAT WE'VE

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.560
PRIORITIZED- IMPACTED

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:53.129
INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS IMPACTED-

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:55.098
COMMUNITIES GEOGRAPHIES AND

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:57.167
UNDERSERVED BUSINESS GROUPS AND

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.802
SO- YOU KNOW IF. IF MORE

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:00.971
SPECIFIC TARGETING TOWARDS

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.439
SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES IS OF

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.573
INTEREST I KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.475
BEEN A REQUEST FOR TWENTY FIVE

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:06.309
MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.344
CULTURE INSTITUTION AS AN

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.212
EXAMPLE. OF ME THAT CAN BE

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:11.147
EMBEDDED IN IN THE PROGRAM IN

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:13.350
THE ANALYSIS IN FUTURE IN

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.085
FUTURE ROUNDS WITHOUT

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.454
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OKAY SO

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.458
NOW- I WANT SOME QUESTIONS THE

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:26.062
ELADIO- SO YOU LAID OUT YOUR

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:28.031
REPORT IN THESE VARIOUS

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:31.801
RECOMMENDATIONS- AND I NOTICED

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:34.070
IN THE FINAL PAGES YOU DO MAKE

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:36.339
SOME SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:39.643
HOW TO TARGET- BUT THE MAIN

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.412
SPECIFIC ONE IS TARGET ENTITIES

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:44.214
THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.017
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. ON AND WE

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.952
MAY WANT TO REVISIT WHETHER OUR

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.588
CRITERIA IN FACT DOES THAT OR

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.989
NOT BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.959
FROM LA- IS WHAT I ALWAYS

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:59.696
APPRECIATE- L. A. O. OFTEN

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:00.897
RAISES SOME VERY LEGITIMATE

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.899
POINTS BUT DOES NOT NECESSARILY

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.301
GIVE US. SPECIFIC CONCRETE

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:07.170
SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT WE MIGHT

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:09.339
CONSIDER IN TERMS OF IMPROVING.

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:12.275
EITHER THAT OF IMPROVING OUR

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.943
ABILITY TO REACH THE MOST

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.578
IMPACTED ENTITY OR IMPROVE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.681
TRANSPARENCY SO WHAT I WANTED

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:20.950
TO HEAR FROM LA- IS IF. THEY

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.585
HAD ANY SPECIFIC.

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:23.253
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUR

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:25.455
CONSIDERATION BEYOND FOR

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:26.589
EXAMPLE THE TARGETING OF

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.491
ENTITIES THAT COULDN'T GET

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:34.531
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. HELLO YES

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:39.469
SO- ONE ONE THING THAT WAS

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:40.470
BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WAS

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.672
THE IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:43.406
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:45.842
ON GRANTS OR A NEW A NEW

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.811
PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:48.311
ASSISTANCE TO PERFORMING

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:51.081
INSTITUTIONS AND MANY OF THE

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:53.349
STATE'S MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.085
INSTITUTIONS WITH PERFORMANCE

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.753
SPACES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.754
THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR

00:55:57.821 --> 00:56:00.457
EXAMPLE BUT- BUT SOME OF THAT

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:00.890
DON'T HAVE DEDICATED

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.492
PERFORMANCE SPACES MAY NOT BE

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:03.927
AND SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE AREA

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.095
IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE MIGHT

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:06.096
LOOK AT TARGETING THIS PROGRAM

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:07.430
BETTER SO IT TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:08.798
WE DO HAVE A SET ASIDE FOR

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.767
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. YOU

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.302
MIGHT LOOK AT WHERE. WHERE

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.003
THERE'S A GAP IN THAT IN THAT

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.772
PARTICULAR WAY. ON THAT THAT'S

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.707
ONE CONCRETE- SUGGESTION WE

00:56:17.774 --> 00:56:20.076
HAVE. ANOTHER IS ACTUALLY

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:22.345
ASKING- YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:24.314
LOOKING AT THE INDUSTRY'S- THAT

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.348
THAT WERE MOST TARGETED AND

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.684
LOOKING AT. THE ON THE REVENUE

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:30.720
DECLINES- DID THEY- DID THEY

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.922
RECEIVE- A P. P. P. THAT WAS

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:34.157
PROPORTIONAL WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.159
THE REVENUE DECLINE AND- IN MAY

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.727
BE PRIORITIZING IT TOWARDS

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:38.928
THOSE THAT HAVE THE LARGEST GAP

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:41.231
BETWEEN. THEIR ON THEIR DECLINE

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:43.266
IN IN REVENUE AND PERHAPS ALSO

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:45.068
LOOKING AT. THREE ANY INCREASE

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:47.070
IN THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES IN

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.938
RESPONDING TO COPE IT. SO

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:51.141
THERE'S WAYS TO- FURTHER

00:56:51.207 --> 00:56:56.179
FURTHER NARROW- WITHIN THIS

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:56.679
GROUP THAT'S ORIGINALLY

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.381
TARGETED SO- YOU KNOW IN

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.183
ANOTHER- ANOTHER OBSERVATION WE

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.585
HAD IS THAT- IN THE GEOGRAPHIC

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.554
DISTRIBUTION. ALL COUNTIES IN

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:07.390
THE STATE HAVE BEEN- UNDER-

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.191
STATE HOMEOWNERS AT SOME POINT

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:11.060
SO- WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE

00:57:11.127 --> 00:57:13.129
WE'RE KIND OF- GEOGRAPHICALLY

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.831
BEING EVENLY WEIGHTED AND HOW

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:15.965
WE'RE LOOK FOR LOOKING AT

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.734
OTHERS. AND STILL STILL NEED A

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.668
LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.737
THAT BUT- BUT PERHAPS IT SHOULD

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:22.806
BE TARGETED TOWARDS- THE

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:24.808
COUNTIES WHERE THEY WERE UNDER-

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:27.210
MUCH LONGER- IN THE PURPLE

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:29.846
CHAIR FOR EXAMPLE. THANKS I

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:31.080
APPRECIATE THAT AND I RAISE

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.682
THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE IN

00:57:32.749 --> 00:57:34.083
OVERSIGHT HEARING NOW WE'RE NOT

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.487
VOTING AND- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY.

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:40.290
THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT WHICH I

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:43.493
SUPPORT AND I THINK I THINK.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.994
NOT TO BE TOO BOLD FOR THE

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.062
LEGISLATURE'S INTENT ALSO WOULD

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:49.032
BE TO WE KNOW. THAT OUR SMALL

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:50.366
BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS HURTING

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:53.469
WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN TERMS

00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:54.904
OF GETTING US BACK ON TRACK

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.539
ECONOMICALLY THEY ARE THE

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.741
PRIMARY PROVIDER OF JOBS IN THE

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:01.044
STATE AND WE KNOW THAT. VAST

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.146
MAJORITY OF JOBS LOST OF PEOPLE

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:04.480
ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED WERE

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:05.615
PEOPLE THAT WERE HAD BEEN

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.684
EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESS.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:08.484
THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:11.321
IMPORTANT AREA. AND WHAT THE L.

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:13.990
A. O.'S AND IT'S AND IT'S NOT

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:17.727
ONLY A. VERY IMPORTANT AREA

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.261
IT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE.

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.529
URGENCY AND IMMEDIACY ACTION IS

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.731
BENEFICIAL. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:25.168
DO IT RIGHT SO THE L. A. O.'S

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:31.140
DOCUMENT WAS A LITTLE- OKAY

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.575
LESS HELPFUL FOR ME ONLY

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.177
BECAUSE IN SAYING THE

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.478
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:38.047
COLLECT DATA OR REVIEW THESE

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:41.117
THINGS BEFORE. AND THAT IS

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.953
OPTIMAL AT TIMES BUT WE ARE IN

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.055
A WE ARE WE ARE IN NEED OF

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:49.025
IMMEDIATE ACTION NOW SO GIVEN

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:51.127
OUR PAST EXPERIENCE. AND A

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.762
WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE TO LA ONE

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:55.632
OTHERS HAVE. SOME CONCRETE

00:58:55.698 --> 00:59:00.169
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FOURTH

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:03.673
WASTE EITHER TARGET OR- ADDRESS

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.108
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ELIO

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:07.043
RAISED WOULD BE I. THINK

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:11.714
HELPFUL FOR US- THE OTHER

00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.549
SENATOR SKINNER YOU MIGHT WANT

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:15.385
EXCUSE ME YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:18.688
ABOUT THE RANKING- IS- OF

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.524
MISCUES MON- SINCE THEY SET UP

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:24.994
THE THIS PROGRAM AND- ANYWAY

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.396
THAT MAY BE THAT THE

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.097
APPROPRIATE THE WAY TOO YEAH TO

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:29.966
GET. A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WILL

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.235
BECAUSE THAT IF I UNDERSTAND IT

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.736
RIGHT AND I DID MISS THE VERY

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:36.172
OPENING IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.808
ACCESS TO HOW THE RANKING WOULD

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.777
OCCUR PRIOR TO THE ISSUING OF

00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:45.114
THE GRANTS CORRECT SO. IT I

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:46.382
THINK IT WOULD BE VERY

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:51.020
IMPORTANT TO SEE THE EXACT. THE

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.189
PROPOSAL FOR HOW TO RANK AND

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.692
MAYBE IT HOW IT WAS RANKED SO

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:57.627
FAR AND THEN HOW. THE

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:01.097
ADMINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING TO

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.900
RANK FOR THE NEXT ROUND SO THAT

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.235
WE CAN IF WE FEEL APPROPRIATE

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:09.472
MODIFY THAT GOING FORWARD. SO

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.607
IF I IF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.977
COULD RESPOND TO THAT I'M NOT

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:14.978
SURE WHICH PERSON IS THE PROPER

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.680
ONE. THIS IS A DIRECTOR THIS

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:19.983
MONTH SO WE- WE DID NOT HAVE

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.118
SPECIFIC TARGET NUMBERS FOR SET

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:23.886
ASIDES BY INDUSTRY OR BY

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.688
GEOGRAPHY OR BY UNDERSERVED

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.724
CATEGORY SO THERE WERE NOT A

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:31.094
PERCENTAGE- GOALS OR OR OR

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.596
STATUS SIDES IDENTIFIED- IT

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.898
WAS. MORE OF AN ANALYSIS AND

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:36.699
ALGORITHM THAT L'INDUSTRIE

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:39.202
CREATED TO- TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.637
WERE HITTING THOSE PRIORITY

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:44.140
CATEGORIES GEOGRAPHIC- IMPACT

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.509
OF COOLEY NINETEEN. BASED ON

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.144
YOUR BLUEPRINTS IN ENCLOSURES

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:49.779
EXCEPT TRACK AS WELL AS

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.581
INDUSTRY IMPACTED BY YOU KNOW

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.282
IMPACTED INDUSTRIES YOUR FALL

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.951
OFF IN TERMS OF THEIR CLOSURES

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.919
OR REVENUE DROPS SUBJECT- AND

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.957
THEN THE. UNDERSERVED AND

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.725
DISADVANTAGED. SO I APPRECIATE

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.394
AND I COMPRISED FINE WITH THAT

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.529
THEIR WORK PER SE SET ASIDES.

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.297
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.999
FOR US IF L'INDUSTRIE COULD

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:12.101
PROVIDE US SOMETHING MORE

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.504
CONCRETE THAT SHOWS WHAT THE

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.439
CRITERIA WORK. BECAUSE IT IN

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.174
OTHER WORDS IT IS IT THAT'S

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.043
WHERE IT BECOMES THIS ISSUE OF

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.611
TRANSPARENCY SO IS THERE

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:24.714
SOMETHING MORE. A LITTLE MORE

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:30.720
CLARITY ON. THE EITHER HOW THE

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:33.656
ALGORITHM DETERMINED PRIORITY

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:36.726
OR CRITERIA FOR PRIORITY WE CAN

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.760
WE CAN THE SENATOR WE CAN

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:39.429
DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOU

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.764
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE- I

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.099
KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW L'INDUSTRIE

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.333
AS IN ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.036
HAVE PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY- SO

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:49.272
WE CANNOT AND WE ARE WORKING WE

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.206
CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.742
PROVIDE THE SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:54.744
SHARE FURTHER INSIGHTS WELL. I

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.546
APPRECIATE THAT SO MAYBE IT'S

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.781
INSTEAD WHAT DIRECTION WE GAVE

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.716
THAT BECAUSE IT IS STATE MONEY

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:04.053
IS GOING TO LEAD TO SPREE SO

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.021
CERTAINLY I DON'T WANT TO.

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.823
INTERFERE WITH LINDA STREETS

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.059
PRIORITY BUT- WE WERE THAT YOU

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.462
KNOW. IT IS STATE MONEY AND WE

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.031
ARE. TRYING TO PROVIDE MORE OF

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:17.767
MORE THAN JUST HIGH HIGH LEVEL

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.303
GUIDANCE ON HOW IT GOES OUT.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.671
SENATOR IF I MAY AND WILL WE

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:22.805
WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND ALL

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.807
THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:25.842
COVERED AND TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.510
WE CAN. AND ALL THE OTHER

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.112
INFORMATION- OKAY SO THAT WOULD

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.847
BE WHAT WAS COVERED BUT ALSO

01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:33.282
GOING FORWARD WHAT YES. OKAY

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.118
NOW. SOMEONE MAY HAVE ALREADY

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.920
ASKED THIS. BUT GIVEN THAT WE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:40.990
ARE HOPING NOT HOPING WE INTEND

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.658
TO EXPAND THAT YOUR PROPOSAL

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.093
AND WHILE IT'S NOT BEEN ADOPTED

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.496
YET I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:49.031
THE LEGISLATURE IS IN AGREEMENT

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.767
THAT WE DO WANT TO EXPAND- THIS

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.069
LED TO STREET IS THAT YOUR

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.470
ASSESSMENT THAT L'INDUSTRIE YES

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.272
THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. OR ARE

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:59.642
YOU ALSO TALKING OTHER VENDORS.

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:00.877
IT WOULD BE OUR INTEREST TO

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.879
CONTINUE WITH THAT THE SAME.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.047
VENDOR I MEAN ONE THE SYSTEM IS

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.716
SET UP- SO IN TERMS OF

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.518
EFFICIENCY AND SCALE AND DOING

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.319
THIS QUICKLY- L'INDUSTRIE IS

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.321
EQUIPPED TO DO THAT- YEAH THEY

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.056
DID OPERATE THE LARGEST A GRANT

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.091
PROGRAM IN THE STATE BEFORE

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.058
THEY DID PENNSYLVANIA'S AS AN

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.027
EXAMPLE- AMONG. NINE OTHER

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:21.531
PROGRAMS. SO WE DO TRUST AND

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.398
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:25.001
SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS TO DELIVER

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.236
THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT- YEAH

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.539
ADDITIONALLY. WE HAVE THOSE

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.841
APPLICANTS IN THE SYSTEM IT

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.976
WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE THOSE

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.244
SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE TO

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.547
REAPPLY WITH ANY OTHER VENDOR-

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:38.681
I THINK THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.617
EXTREME CRIMES OCCUR OKAY. NOW

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.486
AND MAYBE ON I MAY HAVE MISSED

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.087
THIS BUT IS OUR ANTICIPATION

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.223
THAT IF THE IF THE BUDGET MAN

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.658
ON THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:49.825
APPROVE THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:51.627
REQUESTED THAT WE WOULD ONLY BE

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.029
CONSIDERING THOSE THAT HAVE

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.897
ALREADY APPLIED OR WOULD WE BE.

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:59.335
ON OPENING. AGAIN AND

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:00.102
CONSIDERING NEW APPLICANTS. YES

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.771
WE WOULD BE OPENING AGAIN EVEN

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:03.806
IN OUR ROUND TWO WITH THIS HALF

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.408
SECOND HALF OF THAT FIVE

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:06.409
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.377
WE ARE RE OPENING AT TWO NEW

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.246
APPLICANTS SO ALL THE- ALL

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.647
THOSE WHO WERE NOT SELECTED ONE

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:13.082
ONE D. ROUND ONE TO MOVE

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:15.051
FORWARD. AND OTHERS ARE ABLE TO

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.253
APPLY. OKAY SO AT THAT POINT WE

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.155
WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOR

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:22.191
EXAMPLE IF THERE WAS. IF IN THE

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:25.928
FIRST ROUND WE HAD- LIMITATION

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.297
LIMITED MATERIAL SAY IN A

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:31.968
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OR- WHATEVER

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.402
LIMITED TYPE OF OUTREACH WE

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:36.572
COULD WE COULD ADDRESS THOSE.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.609
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- I THINK

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.444
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS I HAVE

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.846
I WANTED TO ANNEX IN ASKING

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.014
THOSE QUESTIONS I WANT TO BE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:48.284
CLEAR I AM NOT RAISING THEM TO

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:51.053
CAUSE US TO NOT MOVE FORWARD

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.822
I'M RAISING THEM TO GIVE US THE

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:55.491
ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.226
THE BEST EFFICIENCY SIMPLICITY

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:59.729
BUT ALSO MEETING THE NEEDS OF

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.664
THOSE WHO WHO NEED IT MOST THEY

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.132
CAN GIVE US THE BEST RETURN IN

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:07.370
TERMS OF- MAINTAINING THOSE

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.171
BUSINESSES AND ULTIMATELY WHEN

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.474
ART WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.843
CIRCULATE BETTER. THAT THOSE

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:16.445
BUSINESSES WOULD THEN BE ABLE

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:18.848
TO RE EMPLOY PEOPLE. YES

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.483
SENATOR IF I MAY JUST ADD TO

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.518
THAT BRIEFLY THAT- WE DO WE CAN

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:23.919
PROVIDE TO YOU THAT THE

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:26.088
CRITERIA IT WAS OUTLINED IN OUR

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.623
OURS P. AS WELL AS OUR CONTRACT

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.625
AND- WE CAN PROVIDE THAT DETAIL

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:32.862
TO YOU AGAIN. VERY GOOD WELL

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:36.032
IT MAY BE THAT- FOR FROM MY

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.433
PERSPECTIVE THAT JUST THE

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.535
VISUALS OF WHERE THE GRANT. THE

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:45.107
GRANTS- HAVE GONE TO M. AND-

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:47.610
THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES BYE BYE

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.645
BYE CARE CATEGORY WOULD BE REAL

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.347
HELPFUL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND A

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:52.948
LITTLE BIT BETTER- HOW THAT. I

BUSINESSES OVER THE SUMMER- BUT

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.252

NONPROFITS AND YOU'VE SEEN THAT

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.601

GRANT OPPORTUNITY HAS BEEN

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:16.171
REMARKABLY STRONG. BUT THE

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.973
RELIEF PROGRAM APPLICATION

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.640

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:21.009
DIFFICULT. FOR NONPROFITS IN A

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:24.212
NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST ALTHOUGH

THERE ARE SEPARATE APPLICATIONS

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:26.949
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND

EXAMPLE BECAUSE NONPROFIT

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.461
LEADERS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:41.830
OWNERS OF THE NONPROFIT. IT'S

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.231

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.100
NONPROFIT APPLICANTS TO

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.768

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:05.020
IT IT COMPELS NONPROFITS TO

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:07.556
SELECT AN INACCURATE ANSWER

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.024
THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR CHANCES

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.360
OF GETTING A GRANT- AND THIS IS

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:14.663
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING- IF THESE

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.831
QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:16.965
PRIORITIZING CERTAIN

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.568
INDUSTRIES- FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:22.804
THE GRANT. SO IN ADDITION SOME

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:25.207

PROVIDING ON GRANT APPLICATIONS

TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.950

TO ANY KIND OF PERSONAL CREDIT

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.589
CHECK AS PART OF A- GRANT

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.891
APPLICATION PROCESS. A TAX ID

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.226
NUMBER FOR AN ORGANIZATION

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.694
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER CHOICE FOR

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.529
NONPROFITS AND WOULD GIVE A

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.865
MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.700
THE NONPROFIT APPLICANT I'M AND

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.335
FINALLY SOME OF THE REQUIRED

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:54.836

NONPROFIT APPLICANTS TO OBTAIN

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.607
ON SHORT NOTICE. GIVEN THAT

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:02.411
TYPICALLY REQUIRED WHEN

NONPROFITS APPLY FOR GRANTS.

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.113
THE CERTIFICATE OF

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.348
INCORPORATION AS ONE EXAMPLE

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.983
NONPROFITS DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.885
THAT AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. I DO

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.253
WANT TO SAY THAT WALK UP WITH

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:12.821
THAT AS WE HAVE RAISED THESE

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:14.523
ISSUES WITH THE INTERMEDIARY

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.258
L'INDUSTRIE. WE'VE GOTTEN

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.359
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

01:18:17.426 --> 01:18:18.994
NONPROFITS CAN COMPLETE SOME OF

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.829
THE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS AS WELL

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:23.165
AS WORK AROUNDS FOR SOME OF THE

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:24.566
OTHER REQUIREMENTS. BUT

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:25.901
NONPROFITS ARE ST STILL

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:28.970
STRUGGLING. TO FIT SQUARE PEGS

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:31.473
INTO ROUND HOLES. SOME OF THESE

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.342
CHALLENGES DISCOURAGE SOME NON

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.477
PROFITS FROM APPLYING AT ALL

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.747
FRANKLY SO- THEY SERVED AS A

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:39.514
AND UNINTENDED GATEKEEPING

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.850
FUNCTION THEY ALSO CAUSED UNDUE

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.052
STRESS FOR MANY WHO DID GO

THROUGH THE APPLICATION

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:47.656
PROCESS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:49.291
AND APPLICATION PROCESS THAT

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.859
FAILS TO GIVE NONPROFITS A

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.994
CHANCE TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.030
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEEDS.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.932
ALSO FAILS TO PROVIDE THE BEST

01:18:56.998 --> 01:19:00.602

CURRENT AMOUNT ALLOCATED FOR

THE RELIEF PROGRAM AS WELL AS

NONPROFIT SMALL BUSINESSES IN

THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.863
MAGNITUDE OF THE NEED IS CLEAR

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.665
EVEN JUST FROM THE THREE

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.033
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.134
THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT WE'VE

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.969
HAD IN THE FIRST ROUND. HELLO

SEVENTY FOUR. GOING FORWARD

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:29.491
HOWEVER RELIEF PROGRAMS SHOULD

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.393
HAVE A DISTINCT APPLICATION.

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:33.628
PROCESS FOR NON PROFITS. THAT

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.863
REFLECTS THE NONPROFIT

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.065
EXPERIENCE INCLUDING

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:37.699
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:40.368
MISSION APPLICATION QUESTIONS

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:41.937
SHOULD ALLOW NONPROFITS TO

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.405
ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THEIR

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.173

THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:50.812
ECONOMIES. THE SMALL SIZE OF

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.447
THE CURRENT PROGRAMS GRANTS

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.149
ALSO WARRANTS A SIMPLER APPLET

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.952
APPLICATION PROCESS FRANKLY-

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.787
FOR ALL NONPROFITS AND SMALL

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:00.889
BUSINESSES. THAT SIMPLE OUR

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.224
APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.124
LESS WORK FOR EVERYONE

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.993
INCLUDING FOUR L'INDUSTRIE AND

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.463

PROGRAM DATA IS NEEDED THE

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.037
PROGRAM DATA THAT HIGHLIGHTS

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.539
THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF

NONPROFIT GRANT RECIPIENTS

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.809

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.811
INCLUDING THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:25.113
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO THAT

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.648
WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.283
WHICH THE PROGRAM IS REACHING

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.352

GOOD ISSUES- AND I'M WONDERING.

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:58.213
IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA BASED ON

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.148
THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ABOUT

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.616
HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED IN THE

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:04.085
POT FOR NON PROFITS IN ORDER

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:07.255
FOR US TO I YOU KNOW BEST CASE

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:11.660
SCENARIO- JUST. I GUESS PART OF

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:12.260
THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:14.229
THAT WE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:17.766
WORKING IN A VACUUM AND WE WERE

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.701
NOT REALLY SURE THAT THE DATA

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.137
WE HAVE IN REGARDS TO LANDLORD

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:25.040
TENANT SMALL BUSINESSES- THAT

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.875
THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT WE

01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.643
CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.278
DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER IN TERMS

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:33.815
OF THE NUMBER OF- OF THEM

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:36.418
NONPROFITS THAT THAT YOU THINK

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.353
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS KIND

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.354
OF A GRANT PROGRAM. AND SHOULD

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:43.525
BE. EVEN IF IT'S AS I REMEMBER

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:46.394
I JUST. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.996
WE REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:50.098
PROGRAM IS THAT- THEY'RE A LOT

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:51.099
THERE ARE A LOT OF NON PROFITS

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:52.901
THAT ARE ALSO ALL VOLUNTEER BUT

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.469
THEY PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.571
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.906
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THIS

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.708
PROGRAM INCLUDES VOLUNTEER

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:00.742
ORGANIZATIONS OF PPP FOR

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.177
EXAMPLE. THE PAYCHECK

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.545
PROTECTION PROGRAM DOES DOES

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.847
NOT ALSO INCLUDE AND VOLUNTEER

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:09.050
ORGANIZATIONS SO I MEAN IT-

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.885
DIRECTOR GOOSE MON MENTIONED A

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.320
HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:14.556
NONPROFITS- IN THAT FIT IN THE

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:16.624
CATEGORIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE SO

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.092
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:19.127
CONSIDERABLE NUMBER. I MEAN ONE

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:21.463
WAY WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IS

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:23.565
WE COULD TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:26.267
THE OVERALL FUNDS AND SET THEM

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:29.037
ASIDE FOR NON PROFITS WE ARE

01:23:29.104 --> 01:23:31.406
PROPOSES THE NUMBER 15% BECAUSE

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:34.676
WE CONTRIBUTE. 15% THE STATE

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:37.045
GROSS PRODUCT- SO THAT'S JUST

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:42.384
ONE. ONE THING TO CONSIDER- BUT

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.252
THE VAST MAJORITY OF NONPROFITS

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.987
ARE STRUGGLING- YOU KNOW SO

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.922
COMPARABLE TO SMALL THE SMALL

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:51.292
BUSINESS COMMUNITY- AND IT IT I

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.894
THINK IT WAS SENATOR SKINNER

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.062
WHO POINTED OUT THAT THE

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:57.265
COMMUNITY IS VERY VERY. BUT

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.467
EVEN- PROFITS THAT ARE

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.102
PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:04.339
ARE BEING TAXED- BY THE NEEDS

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:05.974
OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND NOT

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.309
ALWAYS GETTING THE RESOURCES

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:08.843
THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THOSE

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.713
SERVICES SO- SO I CAN'T GIVE

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.415
YOU WHAT YOU KNOW AND- A-

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:15.216
DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BUT- BUT I DID

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.951
PROPOSE A PERCENTAGE AND I.

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.486
WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:19.921
THINK ABOUT THIS WITH THE

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.356
LEGISLATURE AND OF COURSE BE

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:23.124
ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS. WHAT

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:26.194
WELL THAT WAY OF ANALYZING IT

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.363
IS REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE IT'S

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.097
VERY DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.433
A NUMBER BUT- 15% THAT'S

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:34.769
RELATED. TO THE CONTRIBUTION TO

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:35.937
THE ECONOMY MAKES A LOT OF

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:37.305
SENSE TO ME AND I REALLY

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.274
APPRECIATE THAT CREATIVE

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:42.010
OUTSIDE IT RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:44.913
BOX- AT THINKING AND THEN- I

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:46.014
GUESS THAT THE OTHER PART WOULD

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.683
BE- ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK ON

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.118
A APPLICATION THAT YOU THINK

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:52.220
WOULD. WOULD MORE

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:56.724
APPROPRIATELY. CAPTURED THAT.

01:24:56.791 --> 01:25:00.328
THE DATA THAT WOULD BE NEEDED.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:03.465
FOR THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM. IF

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:05.300
THIS PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD AND

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.068
THERE'S MORE MONEY PUT IN I

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:11.072
THINK I THINK I THINK THERE'S-

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.440
VERY GREAT CONCERN OF THE

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:13.875
LEGISLATURE THAT WE DO WHATEVER

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.944
WE CAN TO. JUMPSTART THE

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.512
ECONOMY AND THIS IS ONE WAY TO

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:20.548
DO IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE-

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:21.983
PROVIDE AN ELEMENT TO

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.451
SURVIVABILITY FOR SMALL

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.320
BUSINESSES IN THE NONPROFIT SO.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:26.888
SO I SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD I

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:27.722
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.090
THE BEST PROGRAM IN THAT WERE

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:31.159
REALLY CAPTURING DATA THAT WE

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:33.962
NEED. TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS.

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:36.831
SO THE QUESTION WOULD BE- I

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:37.966
WOULD BE HONORED YOUR

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:39.968
SUGGESTIONS THAT. THAT THE

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:42.637
APPLICATION BE MUCH MORE

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.272
TAILORED TOWARDS THE NONPROFIT

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.407
WORLD HAVING RUN A NONPROFIT

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:47.675
FOR SIX YEARS I HAVE. A REAL

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.143
SENSITIVITY TO THAT AND IF YOU

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.879
HAVE TO TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:53.081
DO. IN LITTLE CHECK BOXES YOU

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:55.683
KIND OF LOSE. LOSE THE IMPACT

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:56.985
OF THE WORK THAT YOU AS A

01:25:57.051 --> 01:26:00.054
NONPROFIT DO SO- I. WOULD BE

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.257
HONORED TO PARTICIPATE AND

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:03.024
WORKING ON MAKING AN

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:05.326
APPLICATION THAT IS REALLY.

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:06.961
MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR NONPROFITS

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.763

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:09.898
THEY DO IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:11.666
THEY MAKE THAT'S VERY GOOD.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:12.934
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:16.604
AND- A QUESTION FOR MARKER

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:17.572
BURKE I APPRECIATED THE

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:20.141
COMMENTS. ABOUT THE POLLING

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.543
INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDED

IT IS EXCELLENT- IT'S- THERE.

AS I SAY SOMETIMES WE- WE

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:27.849
STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T

GET THE GOOD GOOD DATA ON

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.351

DONE IN IN- IN THAT HELPING TO.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.334
HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.970
CAN SURVIVE AND REOPEN EVEN IF

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:49.537
THEY'VE HAD TO CHANGE THEIR

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.739
BUSINESS MODEL- TOUGH TIME

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:54.475
SOMETIMES. IS IT IS CREATES THE

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:58.179
OPPORTUNITY FOR INVENTION- IT

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.080

IN THIS PART DO YOU HAVE AN

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:05.320
IDEA OF. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.990
WHAT THE NEED IS AND WHAT IS AN

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:10.758
APPROPRIATE NUMBER THAT THAT.

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.627
WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR MEN

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.429
AGAIN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF A LOT

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:15.797
OF NEEDS IN THE STATE THERE'S

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:17.365
NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.399
HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES

01:27:18.466 --> 01:27:20.034
BUT I'M TRYING TO. GET MY HEAD

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:22.203
AROUND WHAT. WHAT SHOULD WE BE

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.906
LOOKING. TO PUT INTO THIS INTO

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:29.510
THIS RESOURCE. IT IS A VERY

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:30.545
CHALLENGING QUESTION AT

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:31.913
APPRECIATE THAT CENTER AND

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.481
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:37.318
HEARING- I'D BE HAPPY TO IT TO

01:27:37.385 --> 01:27:38.486
COME BACK TO YOU WITH SOME

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:40.888
RECOMMENDATIONS JUST BASED ON

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:44.559
WHAT WE'VE SEEN- THROUGH A PPP

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.327
DOLLARS THAT HIT THE MARKET IN

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:47.895
THE SUMMER ALL RIGHT I THINK IT

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.364
WAS ALMOST A HUNDRED BILLION

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:50.832
DOLLARS IN PPP AND I'D ALL. THE

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:52.367
**** LIKE SIXTY EIGHT IN B. B.

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:53.668
B. AND ANOTHER THIRTY SOMETHING

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:56.471
IN IN IDLE- AND MANY OF THOSE

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.873
BUSINESSES MAY NOT MAKE IT AND

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.342
SO I THINK THAT THE SHEER SCALE

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.877
AND WE THINK ABOUT HALF OUR

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:06.314
ECONOMY- AND THIS SIZE. RIGHT

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.649
HALF OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:08.516
EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE OF

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:10.652
CALIFORNIA ARE STRUGGLING AS

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:11.986
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:13.988
ARE HAVING CHALLENGES AND

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:14.856
BRIGHT SOME OF OUR POLLING

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:17.625
SHOWS THAT. 60% HAVE NOT

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.227
REHIRED- BACK TO THE PRE

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.596
PANDEMIC LEVELS SO WE KNOW THAT

01:28:21.663 --> 01:28:22.997
THE DATE IS TELLING US THE

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:24.732
SCALE IS SOMETHING WE'VE QUITE

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.601
HONESTLY NOT SEEN BEFORE AND SO

01:28:26.668 --> 01:28:28.936
BEING ABLE TO RIGHT SIZE THE

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.172
SOLUTION IS CHALLENGING I'M

01:28:31.239 --> 01:28:32.040
HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.941
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE THINK

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.576
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THERE-

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.078
BUT I THINK AT THIS MOMENT MORE

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.613
THAN ANYTHING IS. HOW CAN WE

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.948
MOVE QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.817
AS BUSINESSES ARE HANGING ON

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.886
THAT WE NEED THEM WHERE WE ARE

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:47.388
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT AS

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.323
TIME GOES BY MORE AND MORE

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.159
BUSINESSES JUST CAN'T HANG ON

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:53.161
ANYMORE- AND WE'RE CREATING A

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.929
SCENARIO WHERE IN THE SPRING I

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.931
WE'RE GONNA HAVE. A LOT OF

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.800
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FAILED IN

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.001
THE QUESTION IS AND WHAT DOES

01:29:00.068 --> 01:29:01.102
THAT DO TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.036
AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO OUR

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:07.175
ECONOMY. AND TILT. BIGGER IS

01:29:07.241 --> 01:29:08.376
BETTER HE INTO OF. SILVA AND

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:09.377
WE'RE- THAT FEDERAL. HAS

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.379
FINALISED IN- BUT REALLY THE

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.914
LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE TO MAKE

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.217
THIS POSSIBLE. IS I IS SUCH A-

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.086
IT'S SUCH A HUGE STEP FORWARD.

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:19.353
I'M SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.756
ADDITIONAL DETAIL FOR ALL HAPPY

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:23.357
TO PASS ALONG THE POLLING THAT

01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:24.192
WE JUST RELEASED THAT I

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.394
REFERENCED- BUT ALSO AT THIS

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.262
SCALE IS SO BIG. IT'S HARD TO

01:29:28.329 --> 01:29:29.363
THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT A RIGHT

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:30.932
SIZE SOLUTION BE WHEN YOU THINK

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:32.500
OF THE CONTEXT OF WHAT THE

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.102
STATE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED IN

01:29:34.168 --> 01:29:35.570
FEDERAL RELIEF. BUT WHAT THE

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:36.971
NEED IS AND THEN I THINK THE

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:39.440
REAL QUESTION IS- AS AS A

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:41.576
CENTER SKINNER AND IS YOU ALSO-

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:42.777
I'M SURE I'VE HAD MENTIONED IS

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:43.911
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.113
TARGETED THE BUSINESSES THAT.

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.281
NEED IT THE MOST- AND THAT'S

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.916
WHAT THE SCORING CRITERIA THAT-

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.685
CALLOUSED BA AND L'INDUSTRIE

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:51.919
PUT TOGETHER SO EFFECTIVE TO

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.621
THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:54.088
NEEDS OF POWER HERE IN

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:55.923
CALIFORNIA. HOW DO WE TARGET

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.825
THOSE BUSINESSES IN COMMUNITIES

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:58.793
THAT HAVE HAD STAYED HOME

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.795
ORDERS. THAT HAVE BEEN UNIQUELY

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:03.831
IMPACTED- BY THE PANDEMIC I

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.100
WHERE THE INDUSTRIES- WHO WHO

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:07.735
ARE UNDER A RESOURCE OPTION

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.036
ENTREPRENEURS THAT WE NEED TO

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:10.471
SERVE. ALL THOSE SCORING

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:12.206
CRITERIA ARE ABOUT PRIORITIZING

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.008
THE BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.376
TRADITIONALLY BEEN LEFT BEHIND

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:17.111
OR WHO MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED AS

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:18.679
MUCH OF THE FEDERAL LEAF- BUT

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:20.148
THE WHOLE BUT IN TERMS OF SCALE

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.616
IF YOU NEED HELP. AND HOW MUCH

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:24.352
HELP IS NEEDED AND IS- IT IS

01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:26.053
SIGNIFICANT AND BIGGER THAN-

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.455
THAT WE SEEN AND SO AGAIN. SO

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:29.524
APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:31.359
LEGISLATION TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:33.127
DRIVE THE CONVERSATION- TWO

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.129
BIGGER AND BOULDER PLACES AND

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:36.564
SB SEVENTY FOUR AND- PLEASE LET

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.199
US KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP. THANK

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:44.138
YOU VERY MUCH. AND THAT'S THE

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:44.705
REASON FOR THE QUESTION IS.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:45.239
WHAT SHOULD THE NUMBER BE

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:47.775
APPRECIATE THAT. CENTER NEAL-

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:48.776
MISSED WHETHER FOR YOU'RE STILL

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:54.182
THERE. THE- CONCERN I HAVE

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.249
AGAIN IS WITH THOSE SMALL

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:58.753
BUSINESSES THEY'RE ON THE BRINK.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.522
AND I'M FEARFUL THAT WE ARE NOT

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:02.657
KEEPING CLOSE ENOUGH TRACK. ON

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:06.794
THE BIG PICTURE HERE AS IT

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.863
EVOLVES AND MAYBE SOMETIMES

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:10.765
DEVOLVES WE HAVE TO BE

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:13.201
CONCERNED I HAD LUNCH MONDAY AT

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:15.303
A LITTLE RESTAURANT IN THE

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:18.739
REASON BASEBALL TOWN. THERE WAS

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:20.308
NOBODY IN THAT RESTAURANT. EVEN

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:25.847
NOW. AND THAT REALLY ALARMING

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:28.082
IT'S A MOTHER AND HER DAUGHTER.

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:30.117
IN THE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:32.620
AND THEY ARE ON THE BRINK. AND

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:34.488
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THE

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:38.159
THING WILL. ARE YOU TO MISTER

01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:40.161
WHETHER FOR ARE YOU A KEEP AN

01:31:40.228 --> 01:31:42.830
EYE ON THESE. FAILURE ISN'T AND

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.465
HOW MUCH HOW CLOSE TO THE BREAK

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.400
SOME ARE AND HOW WE CAN

01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:48.069
REDIRECT MONEY TO THEM AS

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.438
QUICKLY AS WE CAN. JUST TO KEEP

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:52.907
THEM GOING THIS IS- NOT JUST

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:55.243
LONG TERM THIS IS. IMMEDIATE

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:58.446
AND URGENT AND WE DON'T WANT TO

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.982
HAVE A BIG PROGRAM ANNOUNCED

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:04.252
THAT IS BUT A FALSE HOPE. ARE

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:04.919
WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:07.788
IDENTIFY. SUFFICIENTLY THE

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.790
SMALL BUSINESSES AND RECRUITING

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.592
DIRECT RESOURCES TO THEM

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:15.763
QUICKLY. WELL WE CERTAINLY ARE

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.865
KEEPING AN EYE ON THE- THE

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.567
GENERAL ECONOMIC SITUATION I

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.502
THINK GETTING DATA- AT THE

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:24.005
LEVEL YOU'RE SUGGESTING. IS

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.873
VERY DIFFICULT AND A PROGRAM

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.176
SUCH AS AS THIS ONE- WHERE IT'S

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:31.946
WHO WORDS REQUESTING- THE

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:34.982
BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THEIR-

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.651
THEIR THEIR ACTUAL DECLINE IN

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:40.288
REVENUE- I THINK LATER IN IN-

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.422
IN THE COMING WEEKS ALSO HEAR

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.256
ABOUT THE MAIN STREET HIRING

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:44.058
TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WHICH ALSO-

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:46.394
TRACKS- DECLINES IN REVENUE

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.762
AND- PROVIDES RELIEF BASED ON

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:48.796
THAT. IS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.665
EFFECTIVE SO WE ARE TRYING TO

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:55.903
GET THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.539
HE POINTED MANY OF BUSINESSES-

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:02.043
ARE AFFECTED- MORE THAN AND-

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:04.812
THE EXTENT WE CAN OUR PROGRAM

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.547
TO THOSE- ON YOUR DEPEND IF IT

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:08.215
DOESN'T MOST OF IS PROBABLY THE

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.116
BEST USE OF THE LIVE AMOUNT OF

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:13.654
RESOURCE. WELL IT SEEMS TO BE

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:16.924
OUT NOT VERY THAT YOU HAVE MADE.

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:21.295
LEAD OFFICE THAT. THIS SEPARATE

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:22.930
MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED IMPACT ON.

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:30.871
X. ON WHAT OF DATA. OR BACK

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:34.608
DOORS DID THE ANALYST BAY THAT

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:38.412
THAT WE HAVE LITTLE. ON THE- SO

01:33:38.479 --> 01:33:41.215
THIS ECONOMY IS X. LARGE AND-

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:44.418
SO EXAMPLE- IS MORE CURRENT

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.087
MENTIONED- THE FEDERAL THE

01:33:46.153 --> 01:33:49.390
FIRST ROUND AND- PEOPLE LEARNS

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.858
ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:55.029
THE- THE IDEA ALONE- ASSISTANCE

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.999
WAS- AROUND THIRTY BILLION-

01:33:58.065 --> 01:34:04.071

LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE TOOK

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:59.299
TWO ACTIONS TO SUPPORT THIS

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:00.667
GROUP OF WORKERS OUR FIRST

01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:03.103

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:21.722
ABOUT HALF OF THE STATE'S

TAXES USING AND HIGH TECH- I

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:30.364
WON'T GO THROUGH THE SPECIFICS

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.898
OF IT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:33.166
RESEARCHING WIND AND ALL MOVE

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:34.935
FORWARD DIRECTLY TO SORT OF OUR

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:38.305
ASSESSMENT AND NOT RAISED A

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:38.905
COUPLE OF POINTS OUT THE FIRST

01:44:38.972 --> 01:44:40.674
IS THAT. GENERALLY SPEAKING

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:42.743
USING ONE TIME FUNDS- FOR

01:44:42.809 --> 01:44:44.711
PANDEMIC LEAVE AT THIS POINT

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.346
MAKES SENSE- THE STATE IS THAT

01:44:46.413 --> 01:44:47.681
RECEIVER ONE TIME REVENUE

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:50.017
WINDFALL. FALL BY YOURS AS WE

ESTIMATE OF. BUDGET STRUCTURAL

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.054
DEFICITS AND SO USING ONE TIME

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.189
RESOURCES NOW OPT FOR ONE TIME

RELIEF EFFORTS FIX FISCAL

01:44:57.824 --> 01:45:00.861
SENSE. I'M BUT THE SAME TIME.

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:02.963
THE PAYMENT SOME DON'T. ARE

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.797
LIKELY TO BE A MAJOR

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:05.098
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE STATE'S

01:45:05.165 --> 01:45:07.768
ECONOMIC RECOVERY- AND THIS

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:08.969
ISN'T. I JUST THINK THE PROGRAM

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:11.204
ITSELF IS JUST A- RECOGNITION

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:13.073
THAT AFTER TWO POINT FOUR

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.174
BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IS

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.309
RELATIVELY SMALL IN THE CONTEXT

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:18.178
OF THE OVERALL STATE ECONOMY I

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:19.846
REPRESENTS ABOUT ONE TENTH OF

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:22.783
1% OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY. ON

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.584
THE THIRD POINT. IS SORT OF

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:26.219
RELATED TO THE SECOND THAT WE

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:27.187
POINT OUT IN OUR ASSESSMENT IS

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:28.455
THAT BECAUSE THAT IS THE

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.992
STIMULUS EFFECT ISN'T FIRST AND

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:34.661
FOREMOST- ONE OF THE KEY GOALS

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.830
OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OUT

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.098
WE POINT OUT THAT INSTEAD

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:39.933
FOCUSING ON FILLING IN THE GAPS

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.702
WERE FEDERAL LEAVE HAS NOT BEEN

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.003
AVAILABLE I SHOULD BE A

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.504
PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:46.306
AND THE STATE. OF WHICH HE'S

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:48.775
FUNDS. AND AS SUCH IT'S NOT

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.610
CLEAR TO OUR OFFICE THEY'RE

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.913
PRIORITIZING THE TWENTY

01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:54.981
NINETEEN. CAL E. I. T. C.

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:57.551
RECIPIENTS- ON IS THAT THE BEST

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.152
APPROACH AT THIS TIME IN PART

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:01.254
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE WORKERS

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:02.823
THOUGH CERTAINLY SOME OF WHOM

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:03.824
HAVE SUFFERED JOB LOSSES DURING

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.325
THE PANDEMIC. HAVE BEEN

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.827
ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.695
PROGRAMS I MENTIONED BEFORE AND

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:09.696
THOSE FROM THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:12.532
WILL HELP STABILIZE THESE

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:15.736
HOUSEHOLD INCOME- ADDITIONALLY

01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:16.169
THERE ARE SOME OTHER

01:46:16.236 --> 01:46:17.671
LIMITATIONS USING THE KEPT THE

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.906
EITC TARGETING MECHANISM- FIRST

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:22.175
AND FOREMOST THAT ABOUT 20% OF

01:46:22.242 --> 01:46:23.910
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

01:46:23.977 --> 01:46:26.179
TO RECEIVE THE EITC DO NOT

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:28.081
CLAIM IT AND SO USING THIS

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:28.949
MECHANISM WOULDN'T REACH THOSE

01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:32.119
HOUSEHOLDS AND SECONDARILY. ON

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.488
THE KEY ADVANTAGES OF THE EITC

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:36.356
FROM A RESEARCH STANDPOINT-

01:46:36.423 --> 01:46:37.591
FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT THEY'RE

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.493
PROVIDES WORK AND EDUCATIONAL

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:41.928
AND SOME HEALTH BENEFITS TO THE

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:43.263
HOUSEHOLDS THAT THE RECEIVE THE

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:45.165
CALIFORNIA E. I. T. C. DON'T

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:46.366
NECESSARILY EXTEND TO THIS

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:48.268
PROGRAM THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A

01:46:48.335 --> 01:46:50.337
ONE TIME PAYMENT- IT ALSO

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:51.905
DOESN'T VARY WITH INCOME AS THE

01:46:51.972 --> 01:46:54.474
EITC DOES IN ITS ONGOING

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:56.209
FORMULATION ARE RATHER

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:57.744
MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED TO USE

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.446
THE I. T. ACT YOU SEE SORT OF

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:01.314
AS A WAY TO IDENTIFY THESE

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:02.949
HOUSEHOLDS RATHER THAN. AS A

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:09.589
WAY TO FURTHER OF THE BENEFITS.

01:47:09.656 --> 01:47:10.423
OF THE EITC PROGRAM ITSELF. I'M

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:14.227
SORRY THINK. YOU FOR WITH A RED.

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:16.463
WE NOW A GOOD TIME TO LET COMES

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.934
CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES TO

01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:22.702
INTERVIEW THE SORT OF ONE OVER

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:23.804
ARCHING QUESTION THAT THE

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:25.705
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AS

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.107
IT AS IT CONTEMPLATES THIS. AND

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.809
THAT IS WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.777
HELP LOW IN CALIFORNIA LOW

01:47:30.844 --> 01:47:33.180
INCOME CALIFORNIANS AT THIS

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.615
TIME. I'M ON ON PAGE OF OUR

01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:37.017
HAND I WILL SEVERAL QUESTIONS I

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:37.651
WILL GO THROUGH THEM IN

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:39.186
PARTICULAR BUT WE USE THESE

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:40.387
QUESTIONS OF A FILTERING

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:42.389
PROCESS TO. HELP IDENTIFY

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:44.624
GROUPS THAT THE STATE COULD ARE

01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:47.027
MOST. OF PRIORITIZE FUNDS FOR

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:48.128
AT THIS POINT IN THE FIRST

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:49.930
QUESTION. IS SIMPLY WHO HAS

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:52.098
BENEFITED LEAST FROM FEDERALLY

01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:56.436
EFFORTS GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF.

01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:58.171
THE FEDERALLY- RAMS ADVANCED

01:47:58.238 --> 01:48:01.441
SUCH A AND DOWN THE CAMP. I

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.075
BEGINNING ON PAGE OF OUR HAND

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:05.278
OUT OUTLAW AN APPROACH ALLEGE

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:06.179
COULD CONSIDER AN WE CALLED HIM

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:08.548
HARD AT A RELATIVE TO THE

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:10.417
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON JUST A

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:13.186
FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON THIS

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:14.754
APPROACH. IN ESSENCE- BECAUSE

01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:17.023
ON. WORKERS HAVE BEEN

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:18.525
SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES BUT NOT

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:20.026
BENEFITTED FROM FEDERAL INCOME

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.761
SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.964
NARROW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:25.832
TO PROVIDE A LARGER BENEFIT SO

01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:26.833
LARGER THAN THE SIX HUNDRED

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.335
DOLLAR ONE TIME. I'M TO A

01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:30.437
SMALLER GROUP OF WORKERS-

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.105
SPECIFICALLY I TEN FILERS WHO

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:34.441
ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND

01:48:34.507 --> 01:48:34.941
NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:38.545
BENEFITS- THEY ARE TARGETED

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:41.281
APPROACH SUCH AS THIS WOULD GET.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.316
I'M MONEY OUT SOMEWHAT FASTER

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:44.484
THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:45.719
FOR I. TEN FILERS BECAUSE WE

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:47.954
PROPOSE TO. MAKE THESE PAYMENTS

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:49.623
AVAILABLE TO I. TEN FILERS

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:50.957
BASED ON THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN

01:48:51.024 --> 01:48:52.759
FILING STATUS I WHICH WOULD BE

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:54.261
ELIGIBLE TO GO OUT IMMEDIATELY

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:55.061
RATHER THAN WAITING FOR TAX

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:57.697
FILERS TO FILE THEIR TWENTY

01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:59.199
TWENTY TAXES AND THEN ISSUE THE

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.534
PAYMENTS. I'M HAVING TROUBLE OF

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.536
A MORE TARGETED APPROACH THE

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:05.605
STATE COULD PROVIDE A LARGER

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:06.973
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR REFUND

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:10.243

EXAMPLE OUT WE THINK THIS. TYPE%

OF EXAMPLE WOULD COST SOMEWHERE

IN THE RANGE OF. SEVEN HUNDRED

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:23.156
MILLION DOLLARS TO FIVE BILLION

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.624
DOLLARS. ON BECAUSE THIS AMOUNT

01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:28.395
IS SMALLER. THAN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.829
TO FOUR BILL DOLLARS. WE WOULD-

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.998
SELECTS TO CONSIDER USING.

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.900

GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL

STRENGTHEN THE PROPOSAL

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:14.160
PARTICULARLY TO ADDRESS THE

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:15.328
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.263
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMIT

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.466
NINETEEN RELIEF. AND SO I WANT

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:20.800
TO START BY COMMENDING THE

01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:22.035
OVERALL APPROACH OF THE

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.037
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SINCE THE

01:52:24.104 --> 01:52:25.672
START OF THE KEVIN NINETEEN

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:27.207
PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.209
HISTORIC JOB LOSSES AS ROMA

01:52:29.275 --> 01:52:30.944
WHERE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:32.512
HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK AND LAST

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:33.913
MONTH WE ACTUALLY SIGNED NEW

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.649
NET JOB LOSSES. AND YET THE

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.184
EFFECTS OF THIS RECESSION HAVE

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.453
BEEN DEEPLY UNEQUAL THOUGH JOB

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.421
LOSSES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:43.256
CONCENTRATED AMONG WORKERS IN

01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:45.125
LOW WAGE JOBS WHILE HIGH WAGE

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:46.059
WORKERS HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:47.927
AFFECTED. AND WHILE THE STOCK

01:52:47.994 --> 01:52:49.796
MARKET HAS BEEN BOOMING. THE

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:51.197
BUDGETCENTER HAS ANALYZED THE

01:52:51.264 --> 01:52:52.765
JOBS HELD BY INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.534
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO BENEFIT

01:52:54.601 --> 01:52:55.735
FROM THE PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE

01:52:55.802 --> 01:52:58.438
STIMULUS PAYMENTS. M. AND AS

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:04.644
SHOWN HERE ON THE SCREEN- WE

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:06.179
FOUND THAT MANY BENEFICIARIES

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:07.413
ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN LOW

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.915
WAGE JOBS IN INDUSTRIES THAT

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.316
HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT

01:53:10.383 --> 01:53:12.886
BY KOBE JOB LOSSES LIKE LEISURE

01:53:12.952 --> 01:53:14.654
AND HOSPITALITY AND RETAIL AND

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.122
MANY OTHERS ARE CODE ESSENTIAL

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:17.991
WORKERS IN LOW WAGE JOBS YOU

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:19.726
HAVE CONTINUE TO REPORT TO WORK

01:53:19.792 --> 01:53:20.960
TO KEEP OUR FOOD HEALTH CARE

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:22.395
AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND SERVICES

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:24.230
OPERATING DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:26.699
OFTEN AT RISK TO THEIR HEALTH

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:27.200
AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR

01:53:27.267 --> 01:53:28.835
FAMILIES. AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:30.436
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:32.238
ESPECIALLY CARRYING THE BURDEN

01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:33.973
OF THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.408
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:36.910
CALIFORNIANS WERE STRUGGLING TO

01:53:36.976 --> 01:53:39.345
MAKE ENDS MEET EVEN BEFORE KOBE

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:41.014
NINETEEN HAT. SO THEY ARE THE

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.448
LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:43.783
WEATHER THE LOSS OF A JOB OR AN

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:45.451
UNEXPECTED HEALTHCARE EXPENSES

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:47.720
OR ANY OTHER ECONOMIC CRISIS

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:49.489
RIGHT NOW. FOR ALL THESE

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:51.925
REASONS IF THERE EVER WAS A

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:53.393
TIME FOR THE STATE TO GO BANK

01:53:53.459 --> 01:53:55.195
IN SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS WHO

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:56.062
ARE STRUGGLING THIS IS THAT

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.898
TIME- IT IS A SMART CHOICE TO

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.300
TARGET SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIANS

01:54:00.366 --> 01:54:02.068
WITH LOW INCOMES. YOU HAVE BEEN

01:54:02.135 --> 01:54:03.770
MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE

01:54:03.836 --> 01:54:04.571
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:06.306
PANDEMIC. AND WHO ARE

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:07.574
STRUGGLING TO MEET BASIC NEEDS

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.609
EVEN BEFORE COPE AND- IT ALSO

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:10.777
MAKES SENSE TO BUILD ON

01:54:10.843 --> 01:54:12.345
EXISTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:13.446
SUCH AS THE TAX FILING AND

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.114
PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:15.748
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FRANCHISE

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:18.017
TAX BOARD. AND IT WOULD MAKE

01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:19.018
SENSE TO ALSO INCLUDE

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:20.486
ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIANS WITH

01:54:20.553 --> 01:54:22.288
LOW INCOMES IN THIS COURT. THAT

01:54:22.355 --> 01:54:23.656
COULD INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:24.891
HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THE

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:26.159
RECESSION AND NEARLY QUALIFY

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.528
FOR THE CARRIER TO SEE WHEN

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:29.929
THEY FILE THEIR TAXES THIS YEAR.

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:31.931
AT THE SAME TIME. WE FEEL THAT

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:33.132
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:34.934
PARTICULARLY BE STRENGTHENED BY

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.902
PROVIDING A GREATER LEVEL OF

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.270
SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIANS

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:38.771
WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.340
FEDERAL COVET RELIEF.

01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:42.408
SPECIFICALLY POLICYMAKERS COULD

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:44.043
SIGNIFICANTLY BASED THE SUPPORT

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:45.478
PROVIDED BY A FOR CALIFORNIANS

01:54:45.545 --> 01:54:47.347
WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:48.047
AND THOSE IN MIXED STATUS

01:54:48.114 --> 01:54:50.250
FAMILIES. THESE CALIFORNIANS

01:54:50.316 --> 01:54:52.051
ARE DEEPLY INTEGRATED IN

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.152
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:55.421
STATE. TWO AND THREE HAVE LIVED

01:54:55.488 --> 01:54:56.456
IN THE U. S. FOR A DECADE OR

01:54:56.522 --> 01:54:58.858
LONGER. AND MORE THAN ONE IN

01:54:58.925 --> 01:54:59.759
EIGHT CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:00.960
SCHOOLS MAY HAVE AN

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.562
UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS.

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:03.496
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:04.664
UNDOCUMENTED ARE ALSO A

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:06.065
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE STATE'S

01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:07.834
WORKFORCE BOTH IN SECTORS HIT

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.869
HARD BY KOBE JOB LOSSES LIKE

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:11.938
HOSPITALITY. IN IN JOBS THAT

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.339
ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL DURING

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:15.341
THE PANDEMIC. IN THESE WORKERS

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:16.276
ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL

01:55:16.342 --> 01:55:20.013
WORKERS DURING PREVENT WHETHER

01:55:20.079 --> 01:55:20.546
OR NOT THEY HOLD A SOCIAL

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:22.015
SECURITY NUMBER. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.483
GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:24.617
INCLUDES UNDOCUMENTED

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:25.852
CALIFORNIANS WHO FILE TAXES

01:55:25.918 --> 01:55:27.220
WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:29.255
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND WHO

01:55:29.322 --> 01:55:31.124
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CALLIE IDC

01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:32.025
WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAXES THIS

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:34.260
YEAR. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:35.995
STARTING POINT. BUT IT IS

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:37.163
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:38.564
CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:40.533
FROM VIRTUALLY ALL FEDERAL CODE

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.935
REALLY SO FAR. AND SO LEFT OUT

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.037
OF ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:45.238
DOLLARS THAT HAVE HELPED OTHER

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:46.739
CALIFORNIANS GET THROUGH THESE

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:49.809
DIFFICULT TIMES. FOR EXAMPLE

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:50.443
FOR A FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:52.178
AND TWO ADULTS. FEDERAL

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:53.880
ECONOMIC IN IMPACT PAYMENTS

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:56.549
HAVE PROVIDED UP TO FIVE

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:57.150
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:55:57.216 --> 01:55:58.251
FOR MOST CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

01:55:58.318 --> 01:56:00.186
WITH LOW AND MIDDLE INCOMES.

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.788
FAMILIES WHERE BOTH PARENTS ARE

01:56:01.854 --> 01:56:02.755
UNDOCUMENTED HAVE RECEIVED

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:05.058
NOTHING. AS A RESULT THESE

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:06.125
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:07.393
MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES ABOUT

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.362
WHICH BASIC NEEDS TO COVER IN

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:10.530
WHICH TO PUT OFF DURING THESE

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:12.832
CHALLENGING TIMES. EVEN BEFORE

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:15.168
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN ONE IN

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:16.803
FOUR CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS AND

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:17.770
WORKING FAMILIES WERE LIVING IN

01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:19.639
POVERTY. MORE THAN DOUBLE THE

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:20.907
SHARE OF OTHER CHILDREN AND

01:56:20.973 --> 01:56:22.408
WORKING FAMILIES. AND THE

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:24.077
POVERTY RATE HAS SURELY RISEN

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:25.611
EVEN HIGHER OVER THE PAST YEAR

01:56:25.678 --> 01:56:26.579
CONSIDERING THAT IMMIGRANT

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.081
CALIFORNIANS WERE FAR MORE

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:31.684
LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR JOBS AT

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:32.385
THE ONSET OF THE RECESSION. SO

01:56:32.452 --> 01:56:33.720
CAL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:56:33.786 --> 01:56:35.955
ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY. HELPFUL

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:37.457
FREE MARKETS TO CONSIDER THE

01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:38.725
AMOUNT OF FEDERAL COVERED

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:39.826
RELIEF THE UNDOCUMENTED

01:56:39.892 --> 01:56:41.227
CALIFORNIANS AND EXTENDED

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:42.328
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FROM

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:44.364
ACCESSING. AND TO LOOK TO CLOSE

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:48.101
THAT GAP. SO AS THE RIGHT ON

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:55.074
THE SCREEN SHOWS. I'M THE

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:56.209
PROPOSAL THE STATE SENATE'S

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.077
PAYMENTS WOULD CLOSE ONLY A

01:56:58.144 --> 01:56:59.545
SMALL FRACTION OF THE GAP FOR

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:01.848
THESE FAMILIES JUST 10% FOR A

01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:03.683
FAMILY OF FOUR TO MORE

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.184
EFFECTIVELY CLOSE THE GAP IT

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:06.219
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:07.620
LARGER PAYMENTS FOR THESE

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:08.755
CALIFORNIANS AND TO PROVIDE

01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:10.857
SUPPORT FOR ADULT AND CHILD

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:11.958
SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:12.959
FEDERAL PAYMENTS FROM WHICH

01:57:13.025 --> 01:57:14.360
THESE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS

I THINK THE- I WANT TO. GIVE

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.052
KNOWLEDGE MEANT TO THE

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:41.120
MINISTRATION WHICH I DIDN'T

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:44.757
BEFORE THAT THIS IS WHEN WE ARE

02:07:44.823 --> 02:07:46.592
IN A SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW SO

02:07:46.658 --> 02:07:48.260
MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND SO

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.695
MANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:51.263
INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND SUCH

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.699
ARE REALLY HURTING. THAT AND WE

02:07:53.766 --> 02:07:57.169
HAVE. SOME HOT REVENUES DUE TO

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:59.571
THE STOCK MARKET WHICH THESE

02:07:59.638 --> 02:08:00.672
OTHER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:01.240
HURTING IN THE BUSINESSES

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.641
EARNING AREN'T NECESSARILY

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.877
BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT BENEFITING

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:06.645
FROM THE HIGH STOCK MARKET BUT

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:09.615
WE HAVE. SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:12.084
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO IS TO

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:14.887
LOOK AT ALL RIGHT WHAT OF THESE

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:17.122
ONE TIME ONLY REVENUES. CAN WE

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.524
MAKE AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:20.292
HAVE BEEN MOST ECONOMICALLY

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:22.761
IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC SO I

02:08:22.828 --> 02:08:25.030
REALLY WANT TO APPLAUD. THE

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.031
ADMINISTRATION FOR BRINGING

02:08:26.098 --> 02:08:29.201
THESE FORWARD AND- JUST BE

02:08:29.268 --> 02:08:31.236
CLEAR THAT ARE THAT THE KIND OF

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.105
QUESTIONS AND THINGS THAT WE

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:35.174
ARE RAISING OUR AROUND HOW DO

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.943
WE- IMPROVE THESE THINGS SO

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:39.378
THAT THEY GET TO THOSE WHO

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:41.113
REALLY NEED IT. BOTH BUSINESS

02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:43.715
WISE AND INDIVIDUALS AND THEY

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:46.285
ARE SIMPLE EFFICIENT AND S.

02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:49.655
FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE. SO NOW

02:08:49.721 --> 02:08:53.459
IF I GO TO THE STIMULUS PART- I

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:57.196
WOULD- ASK- WELL I WOULD SAY

02:08:57.262 --> 02:09:00.332
THAT THE EITC PROPOSAL HAS A

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:02.768
LOT OF MERIT IN MY OPINION

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:05.604
BECAUSE- IT IS. FOLKS WHO

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:07.573
RECEIVE THE H. THEY'VE ALREADY

02:09:07.639 --> 02:09:09.374
PROVEN THEIR ELIGIBILITY

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:10.843
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:15.047
IT'S SO IN TERMS OF THAT-

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:17.249
GIVING HIGHER CONFIDENCE OF THE

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:19.084
FRAUD PROOF IT'S GREAT FROM

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.520
THAT POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER AS

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.021
I THINK IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:25.691
THE TWENTY NINETEEN E. I. T. C.

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:29.495
RECIPIENTS MAY NOT ALL BE ISN'T

02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:31.530
AS MUCH NEED AS SOME OTHER.

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:34.032
INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES SO HOW

02:09:34.099 --> 02:09:35.767
IS IT THAT WE DESIGN SOMETHING

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:37.402
TO MAKE SURE GIVEN THAT WE KNOW

02:09:37.469 --> 02:09:39.238
THE FED CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:41.440
PROPOSAL WAS DEVELOPED BEFORE

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.408
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVED

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:45.244
THE DECEMBER THE LAST YEAR'S

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:48.013
ACT. SO HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THIS

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.348
PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:09:49.414 --> 02:09:51.717
ARE ASSISTING THOSE FOLKS THAT

02:09:51.783 --> 02:09:53.552
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HELP YET. AND

02:09:53.619 --> 02:09:56.722
I LIKE THE- THE FOCUS ON I. TEN

02:09:56.788 --> 02:09:58.257
FILERS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE

02:09:58.323 --> 02:10:00.125
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT HELPED

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:02.394
BUT I THINK THE CHAIR ALREADY

02:10:02.461 --> 02:10:05.297
ON. BUT BASS THAT WAS SHE

02:10:05.364 --> 02:10:06.231
DIDN'T QUITE BUT I WANT TO KNOW

02:10:06.298 --> 02:10:08.300
IS WHAT PERCENT DO WE HAVE AN

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:10.135
ESTIMATE OF WHAT PERCENT. OF

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:12.571
ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:14.640
AYE TEN FIVE FILERS. IS THERE A

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.041
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHETHER WE

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:18.277
ARE ADEQUATELY WHETHER THAT

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:20.245
MECHANISM IS ADEQUATELY

02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:23.282
SUPPORTING- SOME OF THE ROAD

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.316
FOR FAMILIES OR SOME OF THE

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:25.651
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.186
OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT. HAVE

02:10:27.252 --> 02:10:29.321
RECEIVED FEDERAL SUPPORT SO DO

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:38.096
WE ARE DOING NOW. THAT WOULD

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:40.699
PROBABLY BE ATTENTION FOR-

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:42.801
RENDON YEAH. THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:47.005
FINANCE. HI I DON'T NEED TWENTY

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:50.676
I BELIEVE- SO STRONG THE NUMBER

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.945
OF ITEMS FILERS MUST PROJECT IS

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:55.581
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND- AND

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:57.616
I THINK. OF SOMEONE WHO

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:59.284
CORRECTLY BUT GOT THROUGH BUT

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.220
IT MIGHT- THERE I THINK THERE'S

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:03.522
ABOUT TWO MILLION. UNDOCUMENTED

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:07.259
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT ABOUT. A

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:09.428
THIRD OF. LAST NAME YOUR DATE

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:17.536
OF. ALL RIGHT. FILE ITEM OKAY-

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:18.403
AND WE ALSO KNOW I THINK IT WAS

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:21.240
A. O. REPORT THAT- THAT IT NOW

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.542
I'M GOING A LITTLE BROADER THAT

02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:27.446
EVERYONE. ALL FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:28.981
ELIGIBLE FOR EITC DIDN'T

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:31.216
NECESSARILY APPLY SO WE HAVE

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:33.619
20% THAT DIDN'T APPLY. SO GIVEN

02:11:33.685 --> 02:11:35.087
THAT I'M WONDERING IS THERE

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:38.223
ANOTHER. ON THE THEME OF

02:11:38.290 --> 02:11:40.926
SIMPLICITY EFFICIENT C. AND

02:11:40.993 --> 02:11:42.327
TRYING TO ACHIEVE YOU KNOW IT'S

02:11:42.394 --> 02:11:44.096
FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE IS

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:46.431
THERE A NOTHER CATEGORY THAT WE

02:11:46.498 --> 02:11:48.700
CAN USE AND- I THINK THE

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:51.003
CALIFORNIA- ERIN RAISED

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.604
SOMETHING ABOUT BENEFITS FOR US

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:55.807
I WONDER IF CALIFORNIA. IS A-

02:11:55.874 --> 02:12:00.712
A- PROGRAM THAT CAPTURES SOME

02:12:00.779 --> 02:12:03.548
MORE OF THESE- INDIVIDUALS AND

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:04.783
FAMILIES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:07.586
SUPPORT AND WHETHER. USING THAT

02:12:07.653 --> 02:12:10.555
MECHANISM. IT N. MAYBE MAYBE

02:12:10.622 --> 02:12:12.591
IT'S NOT INSTEAD OF BUT MAYBE

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:15.694
IT'S IN ADDITION TO AS A WAY TO

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.829
IF ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF

02:12:17.896 --> 02:12:20.666
HELPING THOSE. FAMILIES WHO MAY

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:24.670
NOT HAVE- OR INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:25.237
MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN FEDERAL

02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:28.440
ASSISTANCE. AND AGAIN

02:12:28.507 --> 02:12:30.075
CALIBRATION THING WERE YOU

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:32.210
ALREADY HAD TO BE A SCREEN TO

02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:33.712
ALREADY HAD TO PROVE I DO YOU

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.881
HAD TO PROVE ELIGIBILITY- IN

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:38.183
MANY CASES FAMILIES FOR EXAMPLE

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:40.352
OF UNDOCUMENTED THEIR

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:40.919
APPLICATION IS BASED ON THE

02:12:40.986 --> 02:12:50.529
CHILDREN. BUT BUT GO AHEAD.

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:52.297
QUESTIONS YES THE CARE WHETHER

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.333
YOU ADD TO IT WHETHER YOU

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:58.470
REVIEWED. SO YEAH. AND I AM YES

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:01.273
SO WE DID LOOK AT THE- I THINK

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:02.607
IT WILL POINT WE WERE LOOKING

02:13:02.674 --> 02:13:05.310
AT CALFRESH AND THE PROBLEM.

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:07.579
WITH OUR WITH CALPERS BY

02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:10.749
RECALL. I APOLOGIZE I CAN GET

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:12.617
BACK TO YOU ON THAT- ON

02:13:12.684 --> 02:13:15.487
SPECIFICS BUT- I BELIEVE THE

02:13:15.554 --> 02:13:16.955
PROBLEM IS IT IS A MINISTRY BY

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:18.290
COUNTIES AND THEREFORE WOULD

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:19.558
REQUIRE IT BE MUCH MORE

02:13:19.624 --> 02:13:25.597
DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY- HI. THE

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:29.167
V. IN THE COST. IS UPPER WEST

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.535
PROVISIONS THEY WERE DETERMINES

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:32.771
REPUBLICANS WELL I THINK IT'S

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:34.473
WORTH IT FOR US TO LOOK AT IT

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:37.509
BECAUSE INDEPENDENT OF BEING

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:38.577
REGISTERED BY COUNTIES. THEY

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:40.212
DID ALREADY DO THE

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.047
DETERMINATION IF YOU ARE A

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.182
RECIPIENT OF AN EBT CARD THAT

02:13:44.249 --> 02:13:45.484
FOR CALFRESH BENEFITS YOU ARE

02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.219
HAVE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED AND

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:49.588
ADDITIONALLY. THERE WE KNOW

02:13:49.654 --> 02:13:51.990
THAT FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOLS HAVE

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:54.726
BEEN. VERY HELPFUL TO FAMILIES

02:13:54.793 --> 02:13:56.161
WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:57.362
CALFRESH SO THAT WHEN YOUR

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.131
CHILD A PLACE FOR THE FREE AND

02:13:59.197 --> 02:14:00.832
REDUCED LUNCH THAT OFTENTIMES

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:01.800
THEY'RE INFORMED ABOUT

02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:03.402
CALIBRATION DATE OFFICE SO

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:05.737
SOMETIMES THEY MAY BE A FAMILY

02:14:05.804 --> 02:14:07.406
THAT HAS A CALPERS BENEFIT BUT

02:14:07.472 --> 02:14:08.907
HOUSE EMPLOYED TO ANY ITC

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:09.808
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:12.344
IT. OR MAYBE ARE TO I. TEN

02:14:12.411 --> 02:14:15.213
FILER ADDITIONALLY IT'S A

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:18.350
MECHANISM THAT- YOU KNOW WE

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:20.919
CERTAINLY YES THERE'S THAT

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:22.053
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HOWEVER IT

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.523
IS AN EXISTING. PROGRAM IT'S

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.925
NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE TO START

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:29.361
ALL FOR MY FOR A FRESH AND NEW-

02:14:29.428 --> 02:14:31.329
SO I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE TO

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:33.031
LOOK AT TO SEE IF IT ACHIEVES

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:36.535
SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT

02:14:36.601 --> 02:14:37.169
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THROUGH

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.670
THIS. ON THE OTHER THING THAT I

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:41.640
WANTED TO RAISE. AND THIS IS A

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:47.712
LITTLE BIT SEPARATE FACT- I. IN

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:50.015
LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL'S FIVE

02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:52.384
ALSO BEEN AWARE THAT IN THE-

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:53.552
GOVERNOR'S OVERALL IN THIS IS

02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:54.753
YOUR OR HEARING THAT WE HAD ON

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:59.591
THE OVERALL BUDGET THAT THE.

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:00.158
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:03.528
PROPOSAL BEFORE US CONTINUES-

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:05.764
SUPPORT- OR READING LIST AND

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:07.766
STATE SOME PROGRAM SUSPENSIONS

02:15:07.833 --> 02:15:10.168
AND BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT FOR

02:15:10.235 --> 02:15:12.170
THE FUTURE AND THOSE PROGRAM

02:15:12.237 --> 02:15:15.073
SUSPENSIONS ARE PROGRAMS THAT

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.442
SUPPORT THE VERY FAMILIES THAT

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:18.510
WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS RIGHT

02:15:18.577 --> 02:15:20.912
NOW. AND SO I REACHED THIS

02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:23.415
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YES IT IS

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:25.016
ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT WE

02:15:25.083 --> 02:15:28.520
MUST BE VERY WISE FISCALLY AND

02:15:28.587 --> 02:15:30.689
WHEAT IS PROJECTED THAT WE WILL

02:15:30.755 --> 02:15:36.795
FACE SOME KIND OF- REVENUE

02:15:36.862 --> 02:15:37.362
CHALLENGES SAY IN TWO YEARS

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:39.564
FROM NOW. BUT WE SHOULD NOT

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.833
RIGHT NOW PREDICT WHAT ARE THE

02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:44.936
APPROPRIATE IF NEEDED CUTS. TO

02:15:45.003 --> 02:15:47.606
MAKE AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THIS

02:15:47.672 --> 02:15:48.907
BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST LIKE

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:51.176
NOW WHO WOULD HAVE PREDICTED

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:51.977
TWO YEARS PRIOR THAT WE WOULD

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:53.979
BE IN A PANDEMIC. SO GIVEN THAT

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:56.748
WE DON'T HAVE WE WILL NOT KNOW

02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:59.818
WHAT THE SITUATION OF FAMILIES

02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:01.019
SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS IN

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:02.721
CALIFORNIA ARE IN TWO YEARS

02:16:02.787 --> 02:16:04.923
FROM NOW WE SHOULD NOT ALREADY

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:07.792
FIX. WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS WE

02:16:07.859 --> 02:16:10.295
WOULD BE CUTTING. AND IN THE

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:13.231
SAME THEME THAT THESE STIMULUS

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:14.599
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WE'RE TALKING

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:15.834
ABOUT TODAY BOTH FOR SMALL

02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:19.104
BUSINESSES AND FOR- YANKEE C.

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:21.373
FILERS AND SUCH. WE SHOULD NOT

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.442
ALSO BE INCLUDING A CONTINUED

02:16:24.509 --> 02:16:26.378
CUT OF PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:28.547
SUPPORT MANY OF THE SAME. PARTS

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.549
OF THE POPULATION SO I JUST

02:16:30.615 --> 02:16:32.684
RAISE THAT WHILE IT IS NOT

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:35.253
SPECIFIC TO THESE PROPOSALS I

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:37.422
THINK IN THE BACKDROP OF WHAT

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:40.258
WE ARE DOING IT SHOULD VERY

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:45.430
MUCH BE FACTORED. VERY GOOD-

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:48.500
YOU KNOW I JUST REALIZED THAT-

02:16:48.567 --> 02:16:50.268
CHESS ALAMO HAS HIS HAND UP I'M

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:52.037
NOT SURE IF. YOU WANTED TO

02:16:52.103 --> 02:16:53.538
RESPOND TO ONE OF THE ISSUES

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:55.907
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. BUT I AM

02:16:55.974 --> 02:16:56.908
HOPEFULLY THAT IT HASN'T BEEN

02:16:56.975 --> 02:17:00.111
UP TO FOR A LONG TIME. ONLY A

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:01.413
SHORT PERIOD ROLE GETTING USED

02:17:01.479 --> 02:17:03.148

OUR OFFICE ON. SPENT A GOOD

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:12.424
DEAL OF TIME THINKING ABOUT

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:13.825
EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS WITH

02:17:13.892 --> 02:17:14.960
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY

02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:15.961
EXISTS WHERE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:16.728
TO TARGET ONE TIME USE OF

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:19.030
FUNDS. AREN'T ANY PARTICULAR

02:17:19.097 --> 02:17:20.832
STATE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.634
HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WHO ARE

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:24.336
ELIGIBLE BUT WHO ALSO HAVE

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:25.670
HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS THESE MIXED

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:26.905
STATUS HOUSEHOLDS WOULD BE AN

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:29.240
ELIGIBLE- ONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:31.376
IS TOP OF MIND IT WOULD BE- CAL

02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:33.244
WORKS HOUSEHOLD AS A CHILD ONLY

02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:35.080
CASES. WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE.

02:17:35.146 --> 02:17:36.481
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A COWARDS

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:38.950
BENEFITS- BUT ONE OR MORE THE

02:17:39.017 --> 02:17:40.385
ADULTS ARE INELIGIBLE TO THE

02:17:40.452 --> 02:17:42.120
IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS IS A

02:17:42.187 --> 02:17:44.022
GOOD EXAMPLE OF A- HOUSEHOLD IN

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:46.324
WHICH THE STATE HAS A- DIRECT

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:47.359
EXISTING PROGRAM RELATIONSHIP

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:49.194
WITH. BUT FOR MANY ADULTS ARE

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:50.595
INELIGIBLE CURRENTLY FOR

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:52.230
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS-

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.264
AND SO THESE ARE SORTS OF

02:17:53.331 --> 02:17:55.266
OPPORTUNITIES ARE THAT WE HAD

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:57.202
IN MIND WHEN SUGGESTING THE

02:17:57.268 --> 02:17:58.870
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THIS WITH

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.271
EXISTING SAFETY NET. AS AN

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.806
OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS

02:18:01.873 --> 02:18:03.642
VENDORS CALFRESH FIT IN THAT

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:06.077
ALSO OR IT WOULD WERE YOU

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:09.681
THINKING. THAT SOLELY AND ONLY

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:11.883
CAL WORKS. I WE THOUGHT AS WELL

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:14.419
ABOUT HOW NEEDS THE USE ON

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:17.355
SIMILARLY- UNDOCUMENTED

02:18:17.422 --> 02:18:19.090
IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO

02:18:19.157 --> 02:18:21.993
RECEIVE CALFRESH BENEFITS BUT-

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.094
CITIZEN CHILDREN OR OTHER

02:18:23.161 --> 02:18:24.796
RECORD HOLDERS IN A HOUSEHOLD

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:26.297
RECEIVE RIGHT FITS I'M ONE OF

02:18:26.364 --> 02:18:28.600
THE REASONS WHY- WE THOUGHT

02:18:28.667 --> 02:18:29.901
FIRST TO CAL WORKS IS IT

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:31.503
GENERALLY SERVES A LOWER INCOME

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:33.638
POPULATION AND CALFRESH- SO

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:35.340
IT'S A MORE TARGETED APPROACH-

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:36.341
WE THOUGHT THAT WAS BETTER

02:18:36.408 --> 02:18:37.342
ALIGNED WITH SOME OF THE

02:18:37.409 --> 02:18:38.309
QUESTIONS WE RAISE OUR HAND OUT

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:39.678
ABOUT HOW BEST UC SPONSORED

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:42.714
VERY TARGETED FASHION OF THE

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.215
TIME. OKAY I. THAT

02:18:44.282 --> 02:18:46.151
CLARIFICATION AND I WAS GOING

02:18:46.217 --> 02:18:47.952
TO USE CAL WORKS ADDITIONAL IS

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.354
AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I DIDN'T

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:52.190
WANT TO GO TO LONG BUT- ON THE-

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:55.260
BACK ON THE CALFRESH. FRONT THE

02:18:55.326 --> 02:18:55.760
OTHER THING I THINK IT

02:18:55.827 --> 02:19:00.465
CAPTURES. POTENTIALLY IS THAT-

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:03.268
MANY OF THOSE MANY FOLKS WHO

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:06.604
EXPERIENCED NEW LEVELS OF.

02:19:06.671 --> 02:19:08.840
ECONOMIC HARDSHIP IN THIS YEAR

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:09.841
WHO MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN IN I.

02:19:09.908 --> 02:19:11.943
E. I. T. C. FILER IN THE PAST

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:14.512
FOR EXAMPLE EARLY. MAY WE KNOW

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.247
THAT THERE'S A THERE'S BEEN A

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:18.349
JUMP IN ENROLLMENT IN CALFRESH

02:19:18.416 --> 02:19:21.152
SO IT WAS IN MY THINKING WAS

02:19:21.219 --> 02:19:22.487
PERHAPS WOULD CAPTURE SOME OF

02:19:22.554 --> 02:19:25.356
THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE THAT. WE

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:26.291
WOULD HAVE NEVER PUT IN A

02:19:26.357 --> 02:19:28.560
CATEGORY OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:32.330
SAY LAST YEAR. BUT NOW ARE SO-

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:34.566
THERE WAS THE OTHER THOUGHT

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:38.870
ABOUT CALFRESH. VERY GOOD WELL

02:19:38.937 --> 02:19:41.673

02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:58.923
