BUT HE STILL HASN'T DEALT WITH

02:38:39.476 --> 02:38:40.744
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WHICH

IS THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY

02:38:42.412 --> 02:38:45.215

NOT ALLOW THE NEWSPAPERS TO

UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORT LOCAL

03:27:57.865 --> 03:27:59.033
JOURNALISM AND IMPORTANT ROLE

03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:00.501
THAT IT PLAYS IN KEEPING OUR

03:28:00.568 --> 03:28:02.069
COMMUNITIES INFORMED DURING

03:28:02.136 --> 03:28:03.537
SUCH CRITICAL TIMES TONIGHT

03:28:03.604 --> 03:28:06.273
SUPPORT ETHNIC MEDIA. IT'S

03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:08.275
VITAL FOR MY DISTRICT AS WELL.

03:28:08.342 --> 03:28:09.944
BUT THIS DOESN'T JUST COVER

03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:11.979
ETHNIC MEDIA ARE SMALL PAPERS

03:28:12.046 --> 03:28:13.214
THIS COVERS EVERY SINGLE

03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:15.916
NEWSPAPER CARRIER. I CAN NEVER

03:28:15.983 --> 03:28:17.484

03:28:17.551 --> 03:28:19.253
UNSUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL

03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:20.955
THAT OPERATES AT THE EXPENSE OF

03:28:21.021 --> 03:28:24.959
LOW WAGE WORKERS. TODAY I WANT

03:28:25.025 --> 03:28:25.526
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL

03:28:25.593 --> 03:28:26.460
MEANS FOR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS

03:28:26.527 --> 03:28:27.595
AND I WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE

03:28:27.661 --> 03:28:30.130
NOBODY ELSE IS SPEAKING UP FOR

03:28:30.197 --> 03:28:32.166
THEM. THEY HAVE NO LOBBY. THEY

03:28:32.233 --> 03:28:37.671
HAVE NO UNION. THEY HAVE NOBODY.

03:28:37.738 --> 03:28:38.739
TO REPRESENT THEIR VIEWS. THESE

03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:40.007
ARE WORKERS FROM I CAN. AND

03:28:40.074 --> 03:28:42.877
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET BY.

03:28:42.943 --> 03:28:45.145
IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISINGENUOUS TO

03:28:45.212 --> 03:28:46.413
SUGGEST THAT THESE WORKERS ARE

03:28:46.480 --> 03:28:48.249

03:29:00.594 --> 03:29:01.762

03:29:01.829 --> 03:29:03.330
IMMIGRANTS OVERWHELMINGLY LOW

03:29:03.397 --> 03:29:05.232
WAGE WORKERS HAVE TO GET UP IN

03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:07.067

HAVE TIME RESTRICTIONS AND

03:29:39.433 --> 03:29:40.000
DEADLINES TO MAKE THE

WORKING HOURS AND CONDITIONS OR

03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:53.314
THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY

03:29:53.380 --> 03:29:55.215
COMPLETE THEIR JOB. LADIES

03:29:55.282 --> 03:29:56.583
GENTLEMEN THERE IS NOTHING

03:29:56.650 --> 03:29:58.953
ABOUT THIS WORK THAT SUGGESTS

03:29:59.019 --> 03:30:00.220
THAT THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESS

03:30:00.287 --> 03:30:01.989
OWNERS THESE ARE THE CLASSIC

03:30:02.056 --> 03:30:04.224
DEFINITION OF AN EMPLOYEE. AND

03:30:04.291 --> 03:30:06.393
I'M OKAY WITH THE FICTION THAT

03:30:06.460 --> 03:30:08.595
WE NEED TO JUST CONTINUE THIS

03:30:08.662 --> 03:30:10.097
ANOTHER YEAR. TO ALLOW

03:30:10.164 --> 03:30:11.765
NEWSPAPERS TO GO FORWARD. BUT

03:30:11.832 --> 03:30:13.434
I'M NOT OKAY WITH SAYING ARE

03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:15.469
PRETENDING. THAT THEY'RE GOING

03:30:15.536 --> 03:30:17.338
TO BE ABLE TO EVEN WITHHOLD THE

03:30:17.404 --> 03:30:19.640
BRELO STANDARD. FOR ANYONE THAT

03:30:19.707 --> 03:30:21.475
READ THE DYNAMAX CASE THIS IS

03:30:21.542 --> 03:30:23.110
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF WORKER THE

03:30:23.177 --> 03:30:24.611
DYNAMICS WAS TRYING TO GET OUT.

03:30:24.678 --> 03:30:26.714
I'VE FOUGHT OVER THE YEARS TO

INTO THE RATIONALE THE DYNAMICS

03:30:33.387 --> 03:30:36.824
USED. THIS IS JUST THE OPPOSITE

03:30:36.890 --> 03:30:38.726
OF THAT. IF THESE WORKERS ARE

03:30:38.792 --> 03:30:39.994
SICK THEY HAVE TO MISS A DAY

03:30:40.060 --> 03:30:41.362
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE TO FIND A

03:30:41.428 --> 03:30:42.629
REPLACEMENT AT THEIR OWN

03:30:42.696 --> 03:30:45.032
EXPENSE. ARE THEY BREACH THEIR

03:30:45.099 --> 03:30:46.900
CONTRACT AND MUST PAY A FINE.

03:30:46.967 --> 03:30:48.268
THE PLIGHT OF THESE WORKERS IS

03:30:48.335 --> 03:30:49.970
WHY SPRING COURT UNANIMOUSLY

03:30:50.037 --> 03:30:51.338
ISSUED THE DYNAMICS DECISION IN%

03:30:51.405 --> 03:30:53.741
A BIPARTISAN WAY. IN THIS ISSUE

03:30:53.807 --> 03:30:56.176
PREDATES DYNAMAX EVEN THE MOST

03:30:56.243 --> 03:30:57.911
EGREGIOUS SITUATION THE BURRELL

STANDARD HAS ACTED AS A BARRIER

03:30:59.480 --> 03:31:00.914
PREVENTING THESE WORKERS FROM

ACCESSING THE BASIC EMPLOYMENT

03:31:02.616 --> 03:31:03.951
PROTECTIONS THEY HAVE ALWAYS

03:31:04.018 --> 03:31:05.853
BEEN ENTITLED TO. SINCE THE

05:47:46.512 --> 05:47:47.446
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE INTENT

06:02:27.125 --> 06:02:29.160
DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT RELATED

06:02:29.227 --> 06:02:30.929
TO THE CORONAVIRUS PRICES.

06:02:30.995 --> 06:02:32.564
HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES BEYOND

06:02:32.630 --> 06:02:34.499
THAT AND UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATES

06:02:34.566 --> 06:02:36.401
AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS WHO

06:02:36.468 --> 06:02:38.036

IMPORT THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

06:02:39.704 --> 06:02:41.473

AS ROADS ALL TO CORONAVIRUS. IN

06:02:43.775 --> 06:02:46.411
ADDITION THIS TRAILER BILL SAYS

06:02:46.478 --> 06:02:47.879

INELIGIBLE FOR ANY ENROLLMENT

06:02:51.516 --> 06:02:52.283
GROWTH FUNDING WHICH IS

06:02:52.350 --> 06:02:53.551
COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL SENSIBLE

06:02:53.618 --> 06:02:55.153
BECAUSE THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS

06:02:55.220 --> 06:02:57.255
ARE THE BEST POSITIONED. TO

06:02:57.322 --> 06:02:58.556
ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS

06:02:58.623 --> 06:02:59.824

06:03:02.260 --> 06:03:03.828
THIS BILL VIOLATES THE BASIC

06:03:03.895 --> 06:03:05.964
PREMISE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

06:03:06.030 --> 06:03:08.399

SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PRIOR

06:03:18.209 --> 06:03:20.612
EDUCATION FINANCE BILL BUT AS

MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR

06:03:21.212 --> 06:03:23.081
POINTED OUT. IT DOUBLES DOWN ON

06:03:23.148 --> 06:03:24.816
THE OVERT DISCRIMINATION

06:03:24.883 --> 06:03:26.184
AGAINST NON CLASSROOM BASED

06:03:26.251 --> 06:03:28.186
CHARTER SCHOOLS I MADE MY-

06:03:28.253 --> 06:03:30.021

06:03:44.202 --> 06:03:46.070
JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT OUR

06:03:46.137 --> 06:03:47.772
BUDGET CHAIR FROM SAN FRANCISCO

06:03:47.839 --> 06:03:49.841
TALKED ABOUT THIS IS A CLEAN UP

06:03:49.908 --> 06:03:52.810
TO THE- JUNE BUDGET ACCORD THAT

06:03:52.877 --> 06:03:54.078
WE TALKED ABOUT HERE. AND OUR

06:03:54.145 --> 06:03:56.281
COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON WHO IS

06:03:56.347 --> 06:03:58.183
NOT HERE TODAY. WITH THE ILL

06:03:58.249 --> 06:03:59.918
FAMILY MEMBER TALKED ABOUT IN

06:03:59.984 --> 06:04:01.019
HER DISTRICT THERE IS A

06:04:01.085 --> 06:04:02.387
DISTRICT AND HOW A LOT OF BAY

06:04:02.453 --> 06:04:04.389
AREA GROWTH. THEY WERE PLANNING

06:04:04.455 --> 06:04:06.291
LITERALLY TO DOUBLE THEIR SIZE

06:04:06.357 --> 06:04:07.458
OF THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT THE

06:04:07.525 --> 06:04:09.694
NEXT. CALENDAR YEAR. AND THEY

06:04:09.761 --> 06:04:12.263
WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS HARM BY

06:04:12.330 --> 06:04:14.065
NOT GETTING ADEQUATE FUNDING.

06:04:14.132 --> 06:04:15.500
SO WE DECIDED THAT WAS A FLAW

06:04:15.567 --> 06:04:18.336
WE WANTED TO FIX. UP IN ORDER

06:04:18.403 --> 06:04:20.004
TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE ISSUES

06:04:20.071 --> 06:04:21.539
THAT'S BEING BROUGHT UP. IT

06:04:21.606 --> 06:04:22.473
WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

06:04:22.540 --> 06:04:24.742
OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO MAGIC

06:04:24.809 --> 06:04:25.977
TO FERRY HANDING AROUND MONEY

06:04:26.044 --> 06:04:27.111
HERE THAT MONEY WE HAVE TO COME

06:04:27.178 --> 06:04:29.080
FROM SOMEWHERE. SO I ASKED THE

06:04:29.147 --> 06:04:30.615
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THIS. YOU

06:04:30.682 --> 06:04:31.983
WANT TO TAKE THOSE DOLLARS IN

06:04:32.050 --> 06:04:33.618
YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT OVER HERE

06:04:33.685 --> 06:04:35.687
BECAUSE WHAT WE DID. LAST

06:04:35.753 --> 06:04:37.855
SPRING WE ASK NOT THE TEACHERS

06:04:37.922 --> 06:04:38.890
WE ASK THE WHOLE EDUCATION

06:04:38.957 --> 06:04:41.292
COMMUNITY. SCHOOL DISTRICT

06:04:41.359 --> 06:04:42.760
SCHOOL BOARDS ACCESS THE

06:04:42.827 --> 06:04:44.128
BUSINESS OFFICERS WHAT'S THE

06:04:44.195 --> 06:04:45.463
BEST THING WE COULD DO TO HOLD

06:04:45.530 --> 06:04:47.432
SCHOOLS HARMLESS THEY SAID DRAW

06:04:47.498 --> 06:04:50.001
A LINE IN THE SAND. AS FAR AS

06:04:50.068 --> 06:04:50.802
PICK A DATE AND WILL PICK THAT

06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:52.604
TIME TO FIND SCHOOLS AT THAT

06:04:52.670 --> 06:04:54.105
LEVEL. THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE

06:04:54.172 --> 06:04:55.640
OF THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS

06:04:55.707 --> 06:04:57.208
WHICH WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN

06:04:57.275 --> 06:04:58.209
OUR MEANS AT OUR STATE BUDGET

06:04:58.276 --> 06:05:00.278
WE CAN'T PRINT MONEY I GUESS WE

06:05:00.345 --> 06:05:01.346
COULD TAKE MONEY FROM THE

06:05:01.412 --> 06:05:02.580
RESERVE THE RAINY DAY FUND BUT

06:05:02.647 --> 06:05:03.948
WE NEED TO. AS THAT'S BECAUSE

06:05:04.015 --> 06:05:04.949
THE VICE CHAIR SAID WE NEED

06:05:05.016 --> 06:05:05.950
THAT MONEY FOR NEXT YEAR'S

06:05:06.017 --> 06:05:08.119
DEFICIT SO THIS WAS. A

06:05:08.186 --> 06:05:10.688
RESPONSIBLE DECISION IT'S NOT

06:05:10.755 --> 06:05:12.390
DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST CHARTER

06:05:12.457 --> 06:05:13.625
SCHOOLS THERE ARE MANY CHARTER

06:05:13.691 --> 06:05:14.659
SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT

06:05:14.726 --> 06:05:15.960
FROM THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

06:05:16.027 --> 06:05:16.961
MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A HOLD

06:05:17.028 --> 06:05:18.529
HARMLESS FOR THE- CLASSROOM

06:05:18.596 --> 06:05:20.999
BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS JUST

06:05:21.065 --> 06:05:21.599
SAYS THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON.

06:05:21.666 --> 06:05:23.034
THE PLANNED GROWTH NOT THE

06:05:23.101 --> 06:05:26.437
REALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH-CO THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE OUT

06:05:26.504 --> 06:05:28.039
OF COPING IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

06:05:28.106 --> 06:05:29.741
WE'LL GET BACK TO FUNDING BUT

06:05:29.807 --> 06:05:31.142
THIS WAS A WAY TO MAKE SURE OUR

06:05:31.209 --> 06:05:32.877
SCHOOLS STAY AFLOAT. WE DON'T

06:05:32.944 --> 06:05:34.178
HAVE OUR SCHOOL WE DON'T HAVE

06:05:34.245 --> 06:05:35.213

BEING A LEGISLATIVE CHAMPION.

06:18:11.301 --> 06:18:13.704

06:18:26.784 --> 06:18:28.719
DIEGO. THAT THE TRANSFERS H.

06:18:28.786 --> 06:18:30.421
THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES

06:18:30.487 --> 06:18:32.756
COULD BE SELF DETERMINING. IN

06:18:32.823 --> 06:18:34.792
ESTABLISHING THEIR OWN FUNDING.

06:18:34.858 --> 06:18:37.227
A LITTLE POLICY WONK BUT NONE

06:18:37.294 --> 06:18:40.230
THE LESS IT SHOWS WHAT A TRUE

06:18:40.297 --> 06:18:41.398
CHAMPION IS FOR A LOCAL

06:18:41.465 --> 06:18:44.468

CALLS. AND WE KNOW WHAT IT

06:18:51.308 --> 06:18:53.577

FOR MOST OF US WE STILL

06:18:54.878 --> 06:18:56.613
STRUGGLE TO BE LIKE TAUGHT IN

HUMILITY TRULY HE IS A MAN OF

06:19:04.455 --> 06:19:06.423
THE PEOPLE AND I KNOW THIS

06:19:06.490 --> 06:19:07.624

THIS COULD BE MORE PLASTIC IN

07:13:39.460 --> 07:13:40.894
THE OCEAN BY THE TIME THEY GROW

07:13:40.961 --> 07:13:41.729

THE PAST YEAR. THIS BILL IS

07:13:57.244 --> 07:13:59.346
ALSO AN EXAMPLE OF A TREMENDOUS

07:13:59.413 --> 07:14:01.582
AMOUNT OF COMPROMISE. OF AN

07:14:01.648 --> 07:14:04.752

STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED

07:14:09.757 --> 07:14:11.692

ISSUE. AND I CAN TELL YOU A FEW

07:14:16.029 --> 07:14:17.998
THINGS. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO

07:14:18.065 --> 07:14:19.233
BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE

07:14:19.299 --> 07:14:20.901
BY MAKING EVERYBODY COMPLETELY

07:14:20.968 --> 07:14:21.702
HAPPY IT'S JUST NOT GONNA

07:14:21.769 --> 07:14:23.370
HAPPEN. LET ME TELL YOU WHERE

07:14:23.437 --> 07:14:24.438
WE WERE A YEAR AGO WITH THIS

07:14:24.505 --> 07:14:26.707
BILL. WE HAD A LOT OF MEMBERS

07:14:26.774 --> 07:14:28.909
WHO SUPPORTED INDUSTRY. AND

07:14:28.976 --> 07:14:30.644
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR IT. WE

07:14:30.711 --> 07:14:32.146
ALSO HAD A LOT OF MEMBERS WHO

07:14:32.212 --> 07:14:32.813
CONSIDER THEMSELVES

07:14:32.880 --> 07:14:36.683
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND FROM AND-

07:14:36.750 --> 07:14:38.018
AKAN. WHO DIDN'T TO VOTE FOR IT

07:14:38.085 --> 07:14:38.852
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T THINK IT

07:14:38.919 --> 07:14:40.554
WENT FAR ENOUGH. I THOUGHT IT

07:14:40.621 --> 07:14:42.523
WAS TOO BROAD. THEY THOUGHT

07:14:42.589 --> 07:14:43.390
THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO

07:14:43.457 --> 07:14:46.160
ENFORCE. SO YOU REALLY HAD A

07:14:46.226 --> 07:14:47.461

07:14:47.528 --> 07:14:49.196

07:14:59.239 --> 07:15:01.208
RAMPS. AND SPEED BUMPS FOR

07:15:01.275 --> 07:15:02.609
INDUSTRY TO GIVE THEM TIME TO

07:15:02.676 --> 07:15:04.578
COMPLY. A BILL THAT IS

07:15:04.645 --> 07:15:06.613
ENFORCEABLE THAT'S NERO TO ONLY

PLASTICS IN ONLY THE TIME OF

07:15:08.148 --> 07:15:09.917
THE MOST DIFFICULT PLASTICS. A

07:15:09.983 --> 07:15:11.752

07:15:11.819 --> 07:15:13.654
CHANCE. TO WORK AND DO

07:15:13.720 --> 07:15:16.123

HAPPEN. IF WE KEEP SAYING THAT

07:15:21.428 --> 07:15:22.729

07:15:22.796 --> 07:15:24.231
KEEP SAYING. THAT WE'RE GOING

07:15:24.298 --> 07:15:25.365
TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT WE

07:15:25.432 --> 07:15:27.034
THINK IS PERFECT YOU KNOW WHAT.

07:15:27.100 --> 07:15:28.168
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO

07:15:28.235 --> 07:15:28.902
WHERE EVERY GROUP THINKS IS

CONSUMERS WILL HAVE TO FIGURE

07:21:19.085 --> 07:21:21.221
OUT HOW TO DISPOSE OF IT. BUT

07:21:21.288 --> 07:21:22.589
IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT SOME OF

07:21:22.656 --> 07:21:24.491

LITTERING AND FOR ALL THIS

07:21:38.138 --> 07:21:40.073
TRASH OUT ON THE STREETS. AND

07:21:40.140 --> 07:21:43.143
IN FACT. ACROSS THE STATE MANY

07:21:43.210 --> 07:21:44.477
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING

07:21:44.544 --> 07:21:46.079
UPWARDS OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED

07:21:46.146 --> 07:21:47.180

ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT TRASH

07:21:57.524 --> 07:21:59.593

CANYON. WAS GONNA FILL UP

07:27:08.001 --> 07:27:10.069
BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRASH. NOT

07:27:10.136 --> 07:27:11.404
COURSE THAT'S JUST A LUDICROUS

07:27:11.471 --> 07:27:13.072
NOTION TO THINK THAT THE GRAND

07:27:13.139 --> 07:27:14.741

YOU'RE SIX OR SEVEN I WAS AN

07:27:17.610 --> 07:27:20.046
ASTONISHING IDEA. TO THINK THAT

07:27:20.113 --> 07:27:21.614
THERE COULD BE SO MUCH TRASH IN

07:27:21.681 --> 07:27:23.750
A WORLD OF SOMETHING. THAT EVEN

07:27:23.816 --> 07:27:30.423
I KNEW ABOUT. COULD BE IMPAIR.

07:27:30.490 --> 07:27:32.325
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING

07:27:32.392 --> 07:27:35.161
ABOUT PLASTICS OF COURSE IS THE-

07:27:35.228 --> 07:27:37.997
THERE'S ALMOST NO PRODUCT. I

07:27:38.064 --> 07:27:39.199
GUESS I CAN'T SAY THAT IN A

07:27:39.265 --> 07:27:40.300
ROLE IN THE WORLD THE INTERNET

07:27:40.366 --> 07:27:42.001
BUT THERE ARE FEW PRODUCTS IN

07:27:42.068 --> 07:27:44.637

07:27:44.704 --> 07:27:48.107
MARVEL. OF HUMAN INNOVATION.

07:27:48.174 --> 07:27:51.811
CREATIVITY THE ABILITY TO FIND

07:27:51.878 --> 07:27:53.646
SOMETHING WHERE NO ONE EVER SAW

07:27:53.713 --> 07:27:57.116

INGENUITY. AND SO I FIND IT.

07:28:08.461 --> 07:28:12.198
THE FACT IS IT'S DNA. THAT WE

07:28:12.265 --> 07:28:14.500
ARRIVE AT THESE THINGS BECAUSE

07:28:14.567 --> 07:28:15.001
OF THE MARVELS OF HUMAN

07:28:15.068 --> 07:28:17.870
INGENUITY WHY NOT BRING THAT TO

07:28:17.937 --> 07:28:21.007

MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS WE HAVE

07:31:06.906 --> 07:31:08.608
BEEN LIVING WITH THE MYTHOLOGY

07:31:08.674 --> 07:31:11.277
FOR DECADES. AND THAT MYTHOLOGY

07:31:11.344 --> 07:31:13.646
IS THAT OUR TRASH PROBLEMS

07:31:13.713 --> 07:31:15.181
STARTED WITH THE LITTER

07:31:15.248 --> 07:31:17.183
PROGRAMME IN THE FIFTIES AND

SIXTIES AND THE MYTHOLOGY

07:31:18.418 --> 07:31:20.019
THAT'S BEEN DRIVEN BY THE

07:31:20.086 --> 07:31:21.254
INDUSTRY IS THAT OUR TRASH

07:31:21.320 --> 07:31:23.289
PROBLEM IS OUR FAULT AS

07:31:23.356 --> 07:31:25.358
INDIVIDUALS AS LITERATURES AND

07:31:25.425 --> 07:31:27.960
YES THAT IS A COMPONENT. BUT IT

07:31:28.027 --> 07:31:30.596
IS SO MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE. AND

07:31:30.663 --> 07:31:32.865
COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND IF WE

07:31:32.932 --> 07:31:34.767
STILL BUY INTO THAT MYTHOLOGY

07:31:34.834 --> 07:31:37.470
WE MISS THE POINT THAT WE HAVE

07:31:37.537 --> 07:31:39.839
NOT BROUGHT ALL PLAYERS INTO

07:31:39.906 --> 07:31:43.743

PLASTIC IN OUR ENVIRONMENT THAT

07:32:01.093 --> 07:32:03.529
IS WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT HERE.

07:32:03.596 --> 07:32:04.130
AND IF EVERYONE THROUGH THAT

07:32:04.197 --> 07:32:06.065
SUPPLY CHAIN. REDUCE THE AMOUNT

07:32:06.132 --> 07:32:08.034

FOR WHERE THAT PLASTIC DOES AND

07:32:13.739 --> 07:32:15.908
NOT JUST PUT IT ON TAXPAYERS

07:32:15.975 --> 07:32:18.811
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE IN THE END

07:32:18.878 --> 07:32:20.112

SEEM TO BE ADDICTED TO. THAT'S

07:32:48.307 --> 07:32:49.408
NOT THE POINT OF THIS BILL

07:32:49.475 --> 07:32:50.910
HOWEVER THIS BILL IS THAT

07:32:50.977 --> 07:32:53.713
FRAMEWORK THAT WE CAN ENGAGE

07:36:06.572 --> 07:36:08.941
EDUCATION ON WHAT THAT IS AND

07:36:09.008 --> 07:36:11.477
HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON

THE EXPERIENCE OF A YOUNG GIRL

FROM THE INNER CITY. SHOULD BE

07:37:19.712 --> 07:37:22.581
CLEANING UP A BEACH. THAT'S NOT

07:37:22.648 --> 07:37:24.316
THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE

07:37:24.383 --> 07:37:26.152
SHOULD HAVE IT IS NOT THE TYPE

07:37:26.218 --> 07:37:27.853
OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD BE

07:37:27.920 --> 07:37:29.455

HAS BECOME BLOATED FROM PLASTIC.

07:37:59.652 --> 07:38:05.591
I MEAN WE ARE ADDICTED TO IT.

07:38:05.658 --> 07:38:09.128
AND WE HAVE GOT TO PUT SOME

07:38:09.195 --> 07:38:11.397
REAL SKIN IN THE GAME. IF WE

07:38:11.463 --> 07:38:13.199
ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS

07:38:13.265 --> 07:38:16.235
ISSUE. IT IS TAKING OVER IT IS

07:38:16.302 --> 07:38:18.337
TAKING OVER OUR LAND IT IS

07:38:18.404 --> 07:38:20.773
TAKING OVER OUR OCEANS IT IS

07:38:20.840 --> 07:38:24.844
TAKING OVER OUR BODIES. I CAME

07:38:24.910 --> 07:38:26.812
INTO THIS CONVERSATION A YEAR

07:38:26.879 --> 07:38:29.548
AGO THE BILL WAS INCREDIBLY

07:38:29.615 --> 07:38:34.787
ASPIRATIONAL. EVEN FOR THE MOST

07:38:34.854 --> 07:38:38.791
GRANOLA OF US. AND WE WORKED

07:38:38.858 --> 07:38:41.193
AND LISTENED WE LISTEN TO THE

07:38:41.260 --> 07:38:43.095
OPPOSITION WE LISTEN TO FOLKS

07:38:43.162 --> 07:38:45.331
WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

07:38:45.397 --> 07:38:47.366
AND WE FIGURED OUT A PATHWAY

07:38:47.433 --> 07:38:49.902
THAT MADE SENSE. THAT WAS

07:38:49.969 --> 07:38:52.738
REASONABLE. AND THAT PUT SOME

07:38:52.805 --> 07:38:54.240
SKIN IN THE GAME FOR

07:38:54.306 --> 07:38:56.141
MANUFACTURERS AND FOR

DISTRIBUTORS AND FOR THE STATE

07:38:59.311 --> 07:39:01.780
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS. AND

07:39:01.847 --> 07:39:04.350
SO IT'S ALMOST DISINGENUOUS FOR

07:39:04.416 --> 07:39:07.519
FOLKS. TO WANT TO POOH POOH

07:39:07.586 --> 07:39:11.257
THIS RECOGNIZING HOW MUCH WORK.

07:39:11.323 --> 07:39:13.525
HAS BEEN PUT INTO MAKING

07:39:13.592 --> 07:39:15.895
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS BILL THAT

07:39:15.961 --> 07:39:17.396
IS REASONABLE THAT IS

07:39:17.463 --> 07:39:18.397
MANAGEABLE THAT IS STILL

07:39:18.464 --> 07:39:21.166
ASPIRATIONAL ASPIRATIONAL AND

07:39:21.233 --> 07:39:23.335

WE ARE DYING LITERALLY. FROM

07:39:27.239 --> 07:39:32.011
OVERCONSUMPTION AND-OVERPRODUCTION OF PLASTIC.

07:39:32.077 --> 07:39:33.913
WE'VE SEEN THE VIDEOS WE HAVE

07:39:33.979 --> 07:39:35.881
OUR OWN STORIES WE'RE TRYING TO

07:39:35.948 --> 07:39:36.982
FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE

07:39:37.049 --> 07:39:40.252
PLASTIC IN OUR OWN HOMES. AND

07:39:40.319 --> 07:39:42.121
LORD KNOWS WITH COAL BED WE

07:39:42.187 --> 07:39:44.089
HAVE PROBABLY SEEN OUR FAIR

07:39:44.156 --> 07:39:46.458

THE THINGS THAT ARE GETTING

07:39:49.461 --> 07:39:51.030
DELIVERED TO US WHEN WE WERE

07:39:51.096 --> 07:39:53.799
NOT ABLE TO GO OUT. WE ARE

07:39:53.866 --> 07:39:55.935
BECOMING PART OF THE LARGER

07:39:56.001 --> 07:39:58.470
PROBLEM FAR QUICKER. THEN WE

07:39:58.537 --> 07:39:59.872
ARE WORKING TO BECOME PART OF

07:39:59.939 --> 07:40:02.107
THE SOLUTION IN SB FIFTY FOUR

07:40:02.174 --> 07:40:05.077
IS A REASONABLE STEP TOWARDS

07:40:05.144 --> 07:40:08.347

11:31:26.978 --> 11:31:31.983
DIFFICULT SUBJECT. I'M ALSO A

11:31:32.050 --> 11:31:35.120
MOM AND I AGREE THAT IT WOULD

11:31:35.187 --> 11:31:37.255
BE PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE FOR

11:31:37.322 --> 11:31:39.191
ME TO IMAGINE A SITUATION.

11:31:39.257 --> 11:31:41.493
WHERE SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FIVE

11:31:41.560 --> 11:31:42.761
YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR

11:31:42.828 --> 11:31:44.462
OLD COULD BE CONSENSUAL I JUST

11:31:44.529 --> 11:31:45.864
DON'T BELIEVE THAT EXISTS.

11:31:45.931 --> 11:31:50.202
HOWEVER WHAT CURRENT LAW SAYS

11:31:50.268 --> 11:31:51.536
IS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A

11:31:51.603 --> 11:31:53.772
JUDGE TO DECIDE THAT SEX

11:31:53.839 --> 11:31:55.941
BETWEEN A TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD

11:31:56.007 --> 11:31:58.777
MAN AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD

11:31:58.844 --> 11:32:01.413
GIRL IS CONSENSUAL. BUT SEX

11:32:01.479 --> 11:32:04.015
BETWEEN A NINETEEN YEAR OLD

11:32:04.082 --> 11:32:07.152
MAN. AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD

11:32:07.219 --> 11:32:10.655
BOY. MUST LEAD TO THAT NINETEEN

11:32:10.722 --> 11:32:13.625
YEAR OLD BEING PLACED ON THE

11:32:13.692 --> 11:32:16.561
SEX REGISTRY FOR LIFE. THAT IS

11:32:16.628 --> 11:32:17.896
WHY THE CURRENT LAW IS NOT

11:32:17.963 --> 11:32:21.266
EQUITABLE. IF THERE IS A

11:32:21.333 --> 11:32:24.369
PROBLEM WITH THE JUDGE'S RULING

11:32:24.436 --> 11:32:26.504
THAT SEX BETWEEN A TWENTY FIVE

11:32:26.571 --> 11:32:27.405
YEAR OLD AND A FOURTEEN YEAR

11:32:27.472 --> 11:32:29.741
OLD OF ANY GENDER IS ALLOWABLE

11:32:29.808 --> 11:32:31.943
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK

11:32:32.010 --> 11:32:33.411
AT THAT LAW AND CHANGING THAT

11:32:33.478 --> 11:32:35.580
LAW. BUT THAT IS NOT THE

11:32:35.647 --> 11:32:36.348
QUESTION THAT IS IN FRONT OF US

11:32:36.414 --> 11:32:38.316

MAN AND A WOMAN THAT IS THE

11:32:50.562 --> 11:32:51.897
QUESTION IN FRONT OF US NOW AND

11:32:51.963 --> 11:32:54.866
THAT IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE WITHIN

11:32:54.933 --> 11:32:57.269
THE CONTEXT OF OUR VALUES IN

CASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT

11:33:17.389 --> 11:33:19.291

THAT ARE MADE ASSEMBLY OURS

11:40:02.293 --> 11:40:03.594
BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES THAT WE

11:40:03.661 --> 11:40:05.363

11:40:05.430 --> 11:40:06.864

BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN SEXUAL

11:40:12.770 --> 11:40:14.572
ORIENTATION. WE DID THAT THIS%

NOW TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT

11:40:18.576 --> 11:40:20.244
THE ISSUE OF THIS IS NOT REALLY

JUST THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE

11:40:21.646 --> 11:40:22.880

11:40:22.947 --> 11:40:24.515
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE AND

11:40:24.582 --> 11:40:26.517

POINT OF VIEW SAYING THIS IS AN

11:40:39.230 --> 11:40:40.565
UNJUST TO PRACTICE THAT WE

11:40:40.631 --> 11:40:42.100
HAVE. AND THAT THIS LAW NEEDS

11:40:42.166 --> 11:40:43.534
TO BE CHANGED SO THAT WE CAN

11:40:43.601 --> 11:40:44.769

THIS PANDEMIC BEGAN MILLIONS OF

11:51:17.968 --> 11:51:18.836
CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR

11:51:18.902 --> 11:51:21.505
JOBS DEPLETED THEIR LIFE

11:51:21.572 --> 11:51:22.506
SAVINGS AND GONE INTO EXTREME

11:51:22.573 --> 11:51:24.942
DEBT. AND AS A RESULT THEY'VE

11:51:25.009 --> 11:51:27.111
NOT BEEN ABLE TO PAY THE RENT.

11:51:27.177 --> 11:51:29.079

TEMPORARY VERSION MORATORIUM.

11:51:33.283 --> 11:51:33.784
IF WE DON'T ACT BY MIDNIGHT

11:51:33.851 --> 11:51:37.187
TONIGHT. ANY TENANT WHO'S BEEN

11:51:37.254 --> 11:51:39.323

HAVE TO PAY THAT RENT BACK OR

11:51:43.227 --> 11:51:45.529
BE SUBJECT TO AN ADDICTION. A

11:51:45.596 --> 11:51:46.897
WAVE OF MASSIVE EVICTIONS WOULD

11:51:46.964 --> 11:51:49.099
BE CATASTROPHIC. CATASTROPHIC

11:51:49.166 --> 11:51:51.101
FOR HOMELESSNESS AND COVERED

11:51:51.168 --> 11:51:53.404
NINETEEN SPREAD. IT WOULD TURN

11:51:53.470 --> 11:51:53.904
THIS RECESSION INTEGRATE

11:51:53.971 --> 11:51:55.973
DEPRESSION. THIS BILLS

11:51:56.040 --> 11:51:58.208
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE IS THAT IF

11:51:58.275 --> 11:52:00.377
SOMEONE DUE TO NO FAULT OF

11:52:00.444 --> 11:52:01.645
THEIR OWN IS UNABLE TO PAY THE

11:52:01.712 --> 11:52:04.014
RENT. AND IMMEDIATE EVICTION IS

11:52:04.081 --> 11:52:06.116
NOT THE SOLUTION. AND EVICTION

11:52:06.183 --> 11:52:08.285
WOULD MEAN THAT A TENANT WOULD

11:52:08.352 --> 11:52:10.154
BE FORCED OUT ONTO THE STREETS.

11:52:10.220 --> 11:52:11.822
AND THE LANDLORD WOULD NEVER

GET PAID. THIS BILL SAYS WE

11:52:14.391 --> 11:52:15.726
SHOULD GIVE TENANTS SOMETIME TO

11:52:15.793 --> 11:52:17.461
GET BACK UP ON THEIR FEET. SO

11:52:17.528 --> 11:52:18.495
THAT THEY CAN EVENTUALLY PAY

11:52:18.562 --> 11:52:21.131
BACK THEIR RENTS. UNDER THIS

11:52:21.198 --> 11:52:23.300
BILL. IF YOU'VE EXPERIENCED A

11:52:23.367 --> 11:52:24.635

IS CONVERTED TO CIVIL DEBT. AND

11:53:01.038 --> 11:53:02.673
THEY CAN BE SUED FOR IT. THIS

11:53:02.739 --> 11:53:04.308
BILL ALSO EXTENDS THE HOMEOWNER

11:53:04.374 --> 11:53:05.943
BILL OF RIGHTS. THE SMALL

11:53:06.009 --> 11:53:07.377

MODIFICATION OPTIONS. TWO FINAL

11:53:14.485 --> 11:53:16.186
POINTS FIRST. THIS IS A

11:53:16.253 --> 11:53:19.089
TEMPORARY FIX. DURING THE NEXT

11:53:19.156 --> 11:53:20.357
FIVE MONTHS WE WILL MONITOR THE

11:53:20.424 --> 11:53:21.859
IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND

11:53:21.925 --> 11:53:24.194
RECESSION AND WE WILL HAVE TO

11:53:24.261 --> 11:53:26.296
REVISIT THIS EARLY NEXT YEAR. I

11:53:26.363 --> 11:53:27.931
THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MANY

11:53:27.998 --> 11:53:28.899
OF US WHO BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

11:53:28.966 --> 11:53:31.135
SOLUTION IS THAT THE FEDERAL

11:53:31.201 --> 11:53:34.037
GOVERNMENT MUST STEP UP. STATES

11:53:34.104 --> 11:53:35.606
WITH SIGNIFICANT BUDGET

11:53:35.672 --> 11:53:36.740
DEFICITS CAN'T FIX IT ON OUR

11:53:36.807 --> 11:53:38.475
OWN. WE NEED THE NEXT FEDERAL

11:53:38.542 --> 11:53:39.943
MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE

11:53:40.010 --> 11:53:42.146
ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR STRUGGLING

11:53:42.212 --> 11:53:44.515
TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. MY LAST

11:53:44.581 --> 11:53:46.783
COMMENT IS AFTER WEEKS OF ROUND

11:53:46.850 --> 11:53:48.886
THE CLOCK NEGOTIATIONS WE

11:53:52.256 --> 11:53:53.257
OFTEN SAID THAT THE SIGN OF

11:53:53.323 --> 11:53:55.325
COMPROMISE IS BOTH SIDES ARE

11:53:55.392 --> 11:53:56.793
DISSATISFIED AND THAT'S

11:53:56.860 --> 11:53:59.196
CERTAINLY TRUE HERE. THIS BILL

11:53:59.263 --> 11:54:01.231
ISN'T PERFECT BUT NECESSARY

11:54:01.298 --> 11:54:04.635
SOLUTION TO AN ENORMOUS CRISIS.

11:54:04.701 --> 11:54:06.136
WHILE THIS BILL WILL PREVENT OR

11:54:06.203 --> 11:54:08.572
DELAY MANY OF ACTIONS IT PAINS

11:54:08.639 --> 11:54:10.407

ORDERS LOCKING DOWN THE STATE

11:55:21.011 --> 11:55:23.080
AS A RESULT OF THE COVERT

11:55:23.146 --> 11:55:24.881
NINETEEN OUTBREAK. AND THE

11:55:24.948 --> 11:55:26.383

AS THEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH

11:55:32.656 --> 11:55:34.691
HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS. BECAUSE

11:55:34.758 --> 11:55:36.393
THE COURTS WERE SUBJECT TO THE

11:55:36.460 --> 11:55:37.794
SAME LOCKDOWN ORDERS OF THE

11:55:39.696 --> 11:55:40.931
NECESSARY FOR THE COUNCIL TO

11:55:49.473 --> 11:55:51.241
SO WHY COULD THE COURT NOT

11:55:51.308 --> 11:55:52.976
HANDLE EVICTIONS WILL

11:55:53.043 --> 11:55:55.279

11:56:06.623 --> 11:56:08.225
ATTORNEYS AND LITIGANTS MUST BE

11:56:08.292 --> 11:56:10.527
ABLE TO BE PRESENT. WELL THE

11:56:10.594 --> 11:56:12.629
ONLY WAY FOR THE COURTS TO BE

11:56:12.696 --> 11:56:14.064
ABLE TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNOR'S

11:56:14.131 --> 11:56:15.565
LOCKDOWN ORDERS THAT THE COURT

11:56:15.632 --> 11:56:17.968
REALLY HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO

11:56:18.035 --> 11:56:18.902
SUSPEND THEIR DAY TO DAY

11:56:18.969 --> 11:56:21.171
ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO SAFELY

11:56:21.238 --> 11:56:24.941
COMPLY. AND THIS RESULTED IN A

11:56:25.008 --> 11:56:27.277
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ORDER STAYING

11:56:27.344 --> 11:56:29.546
ALL EVICTION PROCEEDINGS. AS

11:56:29.613 --> 11:56:31.915
THE COURTS BEGAN TO RE OPEN THE

11:56:31.982 --> 11:56:33.684
RATIONALE FOR THE RULE BEGAN TO

11:56:33.750 --> 11:56:35.986
SLOWLY ERODE AND THE JUDICIAL

11:56:36.053 --> 11:56:38.088
COUNCIL EVENTUALLY MADE A

11:56:38.155 --> 11:56:39.856
DETERMINATION THAT EVICTION

11:56:39.923 --> 11:56:42.492
PROCESS. COULD START UP AGAIN

11:56:42.559 --> 11:56:44.094
BECAUSE THE COURTS WELL

11:56:44.161 --> 11:56:45.796
FUNCTIONING AT A FRACTION OF

11:56:45.862 --> 11:56:47.798
THEIR FORMER CAPACITY JUST LIKE

11:56:47.864 --> 11:56:50.100
WE'RE NOT QUITE AT THE CAPACITY

11:56:50.167 --> 11:56:52.336
WE'D LIKE TO BE. THE COURTS

11:56:52.402 --> 11:56:54.237
COULD THEN HANDLE OBJECTIONS OR

11:56:54.304 --> 11:56:56.239
AT LEAST BEGIN TO HANDLE THEM.

11:56:56.306 --> 11:56:57.040
THIS WAS MATT WITH

11:56:57.107 --> 11:56:59.009
UNDERSTANDABLE ALARM BY MANY

11:56:59.076 --> 11:57:00.744
ADVOCATES AND THE COURT

11:57:00.811 --> 11:57:02.713
DEFERRED ACTION HOWEVER

11:57:02.779 --> 11:57:04.715
EVENTUALLY A TERMINATING ORDER

11:57:04.781 --> 11:57:07.351
WAS MADE AND TOMORROW IS THE

11:57:07.417 --> 11:57:09.553
DATE ON WHICH THAT ORDER TAKES

11:57:09.619 --> 11:57:12.856
EFFECT. WHY TOMORROW. IT'S NOT

11:57:12.923 --> 11:57:14.825
JUST A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE

11:57:14.891 --> 11:57:15.959
DID YOU JUST WILL COUNCIL

11:57:16.026 --> 11:57:17.961
WISELY GAVE THE LEGISLATURE THE

11:57:18.028 --> 11:57:20.330
TIME REMAINING IN OUR SESSION

11:57:20.397 --> 11:57:22.399
EVERY MINUTE OF OUR SESSION WE

11:57:22.466 --> 11:57:24.401
NEEDED ALMOST OF ALL OF IT. TO

11:57:24.468 --> 11:57:26.336
COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PROTECT

11:57:26.403 --> 11:57:28.238
LANDLORDS AND TENANTS FROM A

11:57:28.305 --> 11:57:29.840
CHAOTIC AND DAMAGING SET OF

11:57:29.906 --> 11:57:31.274
CIRCUMSTANCES IF WE WERE TO DO

11:57:31.341 --> 11:57:34.044
NOTHING. FORTUNATELY OUR

11:57:34.111 --> 11:57:35.545
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

11:57:35.612 --> 11:57:37.547
HAD A BILL ALREADY IN PROCESS

11:57:37.614 --> 11:57:39.916
HE'S AN EXPERT ON HOUSING. AND

11:57:39.983 --> 11:57:41.952
THIS BECAME THE VEHICLE FOR A

11:57:42.018 --> 11:57:45.055
VERY INTENSE AND COMPLEX ROUND

11:57:45.122 --> 11:57:45.622
OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH

11:57:45.689 --> 11:57:47.791
STAKEHOLDERS. THE ULTIMATE

11:57:47.858 --> 11:57:51.228
RESULT IS THE BILL BEFORE US.

11:57:51.294 --> 11:57:53.497
IT'S NOT A PERFECT DEAL

11:57:53.563 --> 11:57:55.866
LANDLORDS HAVE QUALMS TENANTS

11:57:55.932 --> 11:57:58.335

11:57:58.402 --> 11:58:01.004
AND MEMBERS HAVE TAKEN ISSUE

11:58:01.071 --> 11:58:02.806
BUT THE FACT IS THE BILL

11:58:02.873 --> 11:58:04.174
PROVIDES BADLY NEEDED

11:58:04.241 --> 11:58:06.543
PROTECTION AND STABILITY TO

11:58:06.610 --> 11:58:09.212
POSSIBLY MILLIONS OF LANDLORDS

11:58:09.279 --> 11:58:10.480
AND TENANTS ACCORDING TO TURNER

11:58:10.547 --> 11:58:13.850
INSTITUTE. AND WILL HELP AVERT

11:58:13.917 --> 11:58:17.120
CHAOTIC EKYC A CHAOTIC ECONOMIC

11:58:17.187 --> 11:58:19.856
CATASTROPHE SO I URGE YOUR AYE

THIS IS A BILL WE ABSOLUTELY

11:58:31.201 --> 11:58:34.070
HAVE TO DO AND I APPRECIATE THE

11:58:34.137 --> 11:58:35.038
DILIGENCE IN THE WORK OF OUR

11:58:35.105 --> 11:58:37.607
HOUSING CHAIR WHO HAS DEDICATED

11:58:37.674 --> 11:58:39.843
THIS LAST YEAR. TO BE THAT

11:58:39.910 --> 11:58:41.945
VOICE FOR TENANTS FOR THE SMALL

11:58:42.012 --> 11:58:43.914
LANDLORDS FOR THE FOR THOSE

11:58:43.980 --> 11:58:45.882
FOLKS WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING

11:58:45.949 --> 11:58:48.051
IN THIS PANDEMIC IN UNDER THE

11:58:48.118 --> 11:58:51.455
CURRENT ECONOMIC. SITUATION BUT

11:58:51.521 --> 11:58:53.957
WHAT'S MISSING FROM THIS AND I

11:58:54.024 --> 11:58:54.524
KNOW THE LANDLORDS ARE

11:58:54.591 --> 11:58:56.059
STRUGGLING WITH THIS TENANTS

11:58:56.126 --> 11:58:57.727
ARE LOOKING FOR SOME RELIEF.

11:58:57.794 --> 11:58:59.429
PEOPLE ARE LOSING LIVELIHOODS

11:58:59.496 --> 11:59:02.065
AND MONEY. BUT THE FOLKS WHO

11:59:02.132 --> 11:59:04.367
HAVE THE ABILITY TO HELP HERE

11:59:04.434 --> 11:59:06.837
THE MOST ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO

11:59:06.903 --> 11:59:08.572
ANYTHING UNDER THIS BILL AND I

11:59:08.638 --> 11:59:09.840
THINK WE JUST NEED TO

11:59:09.906 --> 11:59:12.175
UNDERSTAND THAT HERE. THAT ARE

11:59:12.242 --> 11:59:13.443
SMALL LANDLORDS THAT WE WANT TO

11:59:13.510 --> 11:59:14.778
PROTECT THE TENANTS WE WANT TO

11:59:14.845 --> 11:59:15.745
PROTECT IT MAKE SURE THAT

11:59:15.812 --> 11:59:17.614
THEY'RE NOT LOSING THEIR HOMES

11:59:17.681 --> 11:59:18.682
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO STAY IN

11:59:18.748 --> 11:59:19.783
THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT'S

11:59:19.850 --> 11:59:21.184
GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND

11:59:21.251 --> 11:59:23.119
THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM. BUT THE

11:59:23.186 --> 11:59:25.489
BANKS WHO COULD BE HELPFUL HERE

11:59:25.555 --> 11:59:27.257
AND UNDER ANY SCENARIO THE

11:59:27.324 --> 11:59:27.791
BANKS WILL STILL GET THEIR

11:59:27.858 --> 11:59:30.760
MONEY. BUT THEY COULD TAKE SOME

11:59:30.827 --> 11:59:32.996
RESPONSIBILITY. AND COULD HAVE

11:59:33.063 --> 11:59:34.931
TAKEN SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE.

11:59:34.998 --> 11:59:37.033
TO HELP THE SITUATION OUT.

11:59:37.100 --> 11:59:38.101
RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING TO

11:59:38.168 --> 11:59:39.569
PROTECT THEIR SHAREHOLDER

11:59:39.636 --> 11:59:42.506
INTERESTS. AT THE EXPENSE OF

11:59:42.572 --> 11:59:44.674
OUR COMMUNITIES FALLING APART.

11:59:44.741 --> 11:59:46.676
AND PEOPLE FACING THE

11:59:46.743 --> 11:59:49.980
FRIGHTENING. CIRCUMSTANCE OF.

11:59:50.046 --> 11:59:52.816
FINANCIAL RUIN. SO THIS BILL IS

11:59:52.883 --> 11:59:54.384
SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO

11:59:54.451 --> 11:59:56.119
DO. IT'S NOT THE DEAL THAT HAD

11:59:56.186 --> 11:59:58.188
BEEN CRAFTED OVER THE YEAR. IT

11:59:58.255 --> 12:00:00.056
WAS PUT TOGETHER TO SATISFY OF

12:00:00.123 --> 12:00:01.925
LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS.

12:00:01.992 --> 12:00:03.593
AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE

12:00:03.660 --> 12:00:06.062
VERY CAREFUL. WHEN WE'RE

12:00:06.129 --> 12:00:08.398
PUTTING BURDENS ON PEOPLE WHO

12:00:08.465 --> 12:00:09.966
ARE ALREADY BURDENED AND THOSE

12:00:10.033 --> 12:00:11.968
IN A POSITION TO HELP. GET AWAY

12:00:12.035 --> 12:00:14.804
SCOT FREE. THAT PART TO ME IS

12:00:14.871 --> 12:00:16.940
VERY DISTURBING BUT- WE HAVE TO

12:00:17.007 --> 12:00:18.542
PASS THIS BILL TODAY WE ALL

12:00:18.608 --> 12:00:20.810
HAVE TENANTS. SMALL LANDLORDS

12:00:20.877 --> 12:00:22.946
OTHERS WHO ARE JUST HOLDING ON

12:00:23.013 --> 12:00:24.714
IN OUR DISTRICTS. IF WE CAN'T

12:00:24.781 --> 12:00:26.616
PASS THIS RELIEF. THERE IS NO

12:00:26.683 --> 12:00:28.985
PLACE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO AYE

12:00:29.052 --> 12:00:33.156

CONDEMNING WHICH MEANS IT IS

12:00:50.574 --> 12:00:53.109
THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

ENACT JUST LAWS THAT REPRESENT

12:00:55.645 --> 12:00:58.748
AND PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS.

12:00:58.815 --> 12:01:02.218

WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE

12:01:30.814 --> 12:01:32.482

RELIEF TO THAT THOSE FOLKS GET

12:03:55.325 --> 12:03:56.259
THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO LOSE

12:03:56.326 --> 12:03:57.727
THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

12:03:57.794 --> 12:03:59.596
PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES. SO I

12:03:59.662 --> 12:04:01.297
URGE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION

12:04:01.364 --> 12:04:03.566
WITH BOTH MY COLLEAGUES- THE

12:04:03.633 --> 12:04:06.703

12:04:06.770 --> 12:04:07.303
GETTING RELIEF FOR THOSE FOLKS

12:04:07.370 --> 12:04:09.205
IT IS. GREAT THAT WE ARE TAKING

12:04:09.272 --> 12:04:10.406
CARE OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS

12:04:10.473 --> 12:04:11.741
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POPULATION

12:04:11.808 --> 12:04:13.710
THAT. CANNOT PAY THEIR PROPERTY

12:04:13.777 --> 12:04:15.078
TAXES SORRY URGE. THE

12:04:15.145 --> 12:04:16.312
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PLEASE

12:04:16.379 --> 12:04:18.081
LOOK INTO IT WE EXTENDED THE

12:04:18.148 --> 12:04:20.116
PROPERTY TAX DEADLINE. OR THEN

12:04:20.183 --> 12:04:22.218
SOME COUNTY THEY DID NOT IMPOSE

12:04:22.285 --> 12:04:24.254
PENALTIES SO IF WE CAN DO THAT

12:04:24.320 --> 12:04:26.256
AGAIN FOR THAT GROUP. PROPERTY

12:04:26.322 --> 12:04:27.957
TAXES ARE DUE IN DECEMBER WE'RE

12:04:30.260 --> 12:04:31.795
FIXED- HOPEFULLY THROUGH THE

12:04:31.861 --> 12:04:33.463
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WITH THAT I

12:04:33.530 --> 12:04:34.697

12:04:34.764 --> 12:04:36.599

DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL IN

12:04:45.909 --> 12:04:46.442
COMMITTEE WHICH BY THE WAY WAS

12:04:46.509 --> 12:04:49.479
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. AND I HEARD

12:04:49.546 --> 12:04:50.580
THE SAY THAT THIS IS A STOP GAP

12:04:50.647 --> 12:04:52.615
MEASURE. THIS IS A FIVE MONTH

12:04:52.682 --> 12:04:55.118
SOLUTION. I HEARD SEVERAL

12:04:55.185 --> 12:04:56.953
MEMBERS SAY THAT THIS IS A

12:04:57.020 --> 12:04:59.222
HIGHLY IMPERFECT SOLUTION BUT

12:04:59.289 --> 12:05:01.391
IT'S THE ONLY VEHICLE WE HAVE

12:05:01.457 --> 12:05:03.793
THAT IS THIS OR NOTHING. BUT

12:05:03.860 --> 12:05:06.496
THAT'S NOT TRUE WE DON'T HAVE

12:05:06.563 --> 12:05:10.466
TO LEGISLATIVE INTO AVOID. V.

12:05:10.533 --> 12:05:12.535
OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE IS TO KEEP

12:05:12.602 --> 12:05:13.837
WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE OF

12:05:13.903 --> 12:05:18.041

WOULD ALLOW US. TO DEAL WITH

12:05:25.782 --> 12:05:27.383
ISSUES LIKE OF THE ADDICTION

12:05:27.450 --> 12:05:30.753

THE RELIEF IS TAILORED TO THE

12:05:36.092 --> 12:05:38.761
DEMANDS OF THE MOMENT IN A WAY

12:05:38.828 --> 12:05:41.764
THAT BALANCES THE EQUITIES. THE

BENEFITS IN A TIMELY MANNER.

12:06:11.261 --> 12:06:12.795

FULL TWO MORE MONTHS WE STILL

12:06:37.487 --> 12:06:39.155

12:10:57.280 --> 12:10:59.081
ARE THERE SPECIFIC FINANCIAL

12:10:59.148 --> 12:11:02.118

12:11:31.113 --> 12:11:33.749
HOWEVER AS WE RETURN TO OUR

12:11:33.816 --> 12:11:36.586

12:11:36.652 --> 12:11:39.055
IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO BE

12:11:39.121 --> 12:11:41.057

THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED

12:11:49.665 --> 12:11:51.801

WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

12:47:52.159 --> 12:47:53.827
A HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION COULD BE

12:47:53.894 --> 12:47:55.429
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT

12:47:55.496 --> 12:47:56.630
IT SHOULDBE REYES I COULDN'T

12:47:56.697 --> 12:47:57.398
TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT SHOULD BE

12:47:57.464 --> 12:47:59.433
REYES BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAD

12:47:59.500 --> 12:48:01.001
THE TRANSPARENCY TO ALLOW THE

12:48:01.068 --> 12:48:02.503
STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS TO

12:48:02.569 --> 12:48:04.872
WEIGH IN AND TELL US WHAT THEY

12:48:04.938 --> 12:48:07.141
THINK. AND EDUCATE US ABOUT THE

12:48:07.207 --> 12:48:09.810
WEATHER NOT THIS IS A PROBLEM

12:48:09.877 --> 12:48:10.377
IN CALIFORNIA WHAT SHOULD BE

12:48:10.444 --> 12:48:12.079
DONE ABOUT IT. THE LACK OF

12:48:12.146 --> 12:48:13.380
TRANSPARENCY THAT WE'RE SHOWING

12:48:13.447 --> 12:48:14.448
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HERE

12:48:14.515 --> 12:48:16.650
SHOULD BE TRULY ALARMING TO

12:48:16.717 --> 12:48:18.652
EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT

12:48:18.719 --> 12:48:19.953
THERE IS A FURTHER LEGAL

12:48:20.020 --> 12:48:22.256
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THIS

12:48:22.322 --> 12:48:23.590
BILL IS LABELED AS A BUDGET

12:48:23.657 --> 12:48:24.958
BILL THE REASON IT IS SO

12:48:25.025 --> 12:48:26.560
LABELED IS SO THAT IT CAN TAKE

12:48:26.627 --> 12:48:27.995
EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT A

12:48:28.061 --> 12:48:29.596
TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THIS BODY.

12:48:29.663 --> 12:48:31.365
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL HAS

12:48:31.432 --> 12:48:33.066
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET.

12:48:33.133 --> 12:48:35.035
NORMALLY BUDGET TRAILER BILLS

12:48:35.102 --> 12:48:36.637
ARE MANY PAGES LONG THEY

12:48:36.703 --> 12:48:37.805
CONTAIN MANY APPROPRIATIONS

12:48:37.871 --> 12:48:41.809
THIS BILL IS TWO SENTENCES AND

12:48:41.875 --> 12:48:43.444
CONTAINS ZERO APPROPRIATIONS. I

12:48:43.510 --> 12:48:44.778
FEEL THAT THIS IS ALMOST

12:48:44.845 --> 12:48:47.481
CERTAINLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND

12:48:47.548 --> 12:48:49.116
WILL BE CHALLENGED. IN THE PAST

12:48:49.183 --> 12:48:50.884
WHEN BUDGET ARE LABELING A

12:48:50.951 --> 12:48:51.618
BUDGET TRAILER BILLS HAS BEEN

12:48:51.685 --> 12:48:53.754
CHALLENGED. OF WHETHER OR NOT

12:48:53.821 --> 12:48:54.588
IT'S BEEN RELATED TO THE

12:48:54.655 --> 12:48:56.723
BUDGET. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

12:48:56.790 --> 12:48:57.791
POINT AT LEAST A TOKEN

12:48:57.858 --> 12:48:58.926
APPROPRIATION IN THAT BUDGET

12:48:58.992 --> 12:49:01.328
BILL. AS PROOF THAT IT WAS

12:49:01.395 --> 12:49:02.563
INDEED RELATED TO THE BUDGET

12:49:02.629 --> 12:49:04.064
AND THE COURTS HAVE RULED IN

12:49:04.131 --> 12:49:05.632
OUR FAVOR THEY'VE SAID AT LEAST

12:49:05.699 --> 12:49:07.401
IF THERE'S AN APPROPRIATION.

12:49:07.468 --> 12:49:09.336
THAT MAYBE THE LABEL OF A

12:49:09.403 --> 12:49:09.837
BUDGET TRAILER BILL IS

12:49:09.903 --> 12:49:11.271
APPROPRIATE BUT THERE IS NO

12:49:11.338 --> 12:49:13.373
APPROPRIATION IN THIS BILL. THE

12:49:13.440 --> 12:49:14.575
AFFECTED PARTIES ARE GOING TO

12:49:14.641 --> 12:49:15.976
TAKE US TO COURT AND WE'RE

12:49:16.043 --> 12:49:17.811
GONNA FIND OUT FORSURE WHETHER

12:49:17.878 --> 12:49:18.846
OR NOT IT WAS APPROPRIATE LABEL

12:49:18.912 --> 12:49:20.547
BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE IT'S

12:49:20.614 --> 12:49:21.048
GOING TO BE FOUND TO BE

12:49:21.114 --> 12:49:23.317
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO COLLEAGUES

12:49:23.383 --> 12:49:24.585
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD POLICY BUT

12:49:24.651 --> 12:49:26.420
I URGE YOU TO ABSTAIN ON THIS

12:49:26.487 --> 12:49:29.022

GET THROUGH THIS BUT I FEEL

13:49:35.092 --> 13:49:36.126
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR ME

13:49:36.193 --> 13:49:38.395
NOT TO SPEAK ON. OUR THE REASON

13:49:38.462 --> 13:49:39.429
THAT THIS BILL HAS BEEN VERY

13:49:39.496 --> 13:49:41.131
TOUGH FOR ME IS BECAUSE I HAVE

13:49:41.198 --> 13:49:43.733

13:49:43.800 --> 13:49:44.501

13:49:46.203 --> 13:49:47.871
ALL OF THEM AND VERY MUCH

13:49:47.938 --> 13:49:49.005
SUPPORT THE GOALS OF WHAT THIS

13:49:49.072 --> 13:49:50.841
BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND

13:49:50.907 --> 13:49:51.575
BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THE

13:49:51.641 --> 13:49:52.509
ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED

13:49:52.576 --> 13:49:53.677
AGAINST THIS BILL ARE

13:49:53.743 --> 13:49:55.812
INACCURATE AND SOME CASES EVEN

13:49:55.879 --> 13:49:57.881
INSULTING HOWEVER. I WILL SAY

13:49:57.948 --> 13:49:59.182
VERY QUICKLY THAT I HAVE SOME

13:49:59.249 --> 13:50:00.517
MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL

13:50:00.584 --> 13:50:02.486
HAVING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT

13:50:02.552 --> 13:50:03.954
I'VE ANALYZE THIS BILLAND I'VE

13:50:04.020 --> 13:50:05.755
GONE THROUGH IT AND AS A LOT OF

13:50:05.822 --> 13:50:08.658
QUESTIONS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW

13:50:08.725 --> 13:50:10.660
MORE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR WILD

13:50:10.727 --> 13:50:13.597
FIRE AREAS. AND IN AREAS THAT

13:50:13.663 --> 13:50:14.965
RIGHT NOW WE ALLOW SINGLE

13:50:15.031 --> 13:50:16.700
FAMILY HOUSES BUT AN INFILL

13:50:16.766 --> 13:50:18.235
AREAS ARE MOSTLY BUILT OUT

13:50:18.301 --> 13:50:19.035
WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE

13:50:19.102 --> 13:50:20.804
DEVELOPMENT IN A LOT OF AREAS

13:50:20.871 --> 13:50:22.239
IN LOS ANGELES THROUGHOUT THE

13:50:22.305 --> 13:50:23.907
HILLS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE

13:50:23.974 --> 13:50:25.308
HAVE VERY AN ADEQUATE INGRESS

13:50:25.375 --> 13:50:26.843
AND EGRESS NO I'M NOT UP HERE

13:50:26.910 --> 13:50:27.911
TO CHANGE ANYONE'S MIND ABOUT

13:50:27.978 --> 13:50:29.779
THIS. BUT I RESPECT THE

13:50:29.846 --> 13:50:31.081
PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ENOUGH

13:50:31.148 --> 13:50:32.215
TO GIVE THE REASONS WHY I CAN'T

13:50:32.282 --> 13:50:35.185
SUPPORT IT TODAY MY- BIGGEST

13:50:35.252 --> 13:50:37.821
CONCERN HOWEVER HAS TO DO WITH

13:50:37.888 --> 13:50:38.421
THE FACT THAT WHILE I BELIEVE

13:50:38.488 --> 13:50:39.256
THAT THIS BILL WILL CERTAINLY

13:50:39.322 --> 13:50:40.557
OPEN UP A LOT OF NEEDED

13:50:40.624 --> 13:50:42.559
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTERS AND I

13:50:42.626 --> 13:50:44.461
BELIEVE THAT TRULY THAT THIS IS

13:50:44.528 --> 13:50:46.763
NEEDED TO HAVE MORE HOUSING. IN

13:50:46.830 --> 13:50:47.797
A LOT OF OUR SINGLE FAMILY

13:50:47.864 --> 13:50:50.767
AREAS I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT

13:50:50.834 --> 13:50:52.802
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PEOPLE

13:50:52.869 --> 13:50:57.340
WHO WANT TO BUY A HOME FOR

13:50:57.407 --> 13:50:57.941
THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW HAVING

13:50:58.008 --> 13:50:59.409
TO. BID AGAINST SPECULATIVE

13:50:59.476 --> 13:51:02.078
DEVELOPERS. GIVEN THE AMOUNT

13:51:02.145 --> 13:51:05.615
OF. OF A PROFIT THAT COULD BE

13:51:05.682 --> 13:51:07.284
CREATED BY WHAT THIS BILL

13:51:07.350 --> 13:51:09.252
ALLOWS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS.

13:51:09.319 --> 13:51:10.787
SUCH A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM

13:51:10.854 --> 13:51:11.821
WHAT WE HAVE THAT WE SHOULD

13:51:11.888 --> 13:51:13.323
PILOT THIS BEFORE WE DO IT

13:51:13.390 --> 13:51:14.691
STATEWIDE. I THINK THAT'S

13:51:14.758 --> 13:51:16.693
PRUDENT. I'M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT

13:51:16.760 --> 13:51:18.094
HAPPENS IN AREAS IN OUR WE

13:51:18.161 --> 13:51:19.796
AREAS SUCH AS- THEIR HOME

13:51:19.863 --> 13:51:22.265
GROUND PROJECT. YOU HAVE SEVEN

13:51:22.332 --> 13:51:24.000
THOUSAND UNITS ALREADY ENTITLED

13:51:24.067 --> 13:51:26.436
LOTS ALREADY SUBDIVIDED. IN

13:51:26.503 --> 13:51:28.271
WHAT IS OUR WILDLIFE INTERFACE

13:51:28.338 --> 13:51:30.173
AREA. I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS

13:51:30.240 --> 13:51:31.741
AND ASK QUESTIONS AND I BELIEVE

13:51:31.808 --> 13:51:33.843
THAT THAT PROJECT IN TURN FROM

13:51:33.910 --> 13:51:35.679
SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS. ID TWENTY

13:51:35.745 --> 13:51:37.080
EIGHT THOUSAND UNITS RIGHT NOW

13:51:37.147 --> 13:51:38.748
BY RIGHT WITHOUT REVIEW BECAUSE

13:51:38.815 --> 13:51:41.051
OF THIS BILL. WE ARE TRYING TO

13:51:41.117 --> 13:51:42.319
DEVELOP BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

13:51:42.385 --> 13:51:44.521
SO IN AREAS THAT ARE NEAR JOBS

13:51:44.588 --> 13:51:46.323
IN YOUR TRANSPORTATION. IF YOU

13:51:46.389 --> 13:51:47.390
LOOK AT WHAT'S CONSIDERED AN

13:51:47.457 --> 13:51:49.092
URBAN AREA ON THE MAP. IT'S

13:51:49.159 --> 13:51:50.760
ALMOST ALL OF L. A. COUNTY.

13:51:50.827 --> 13:51:52.329
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S NEAR JOBS

13:51:52.395 --> 13:51:54.764
NEAR AMENITIES OR WHETHER IT'S

13:51:54.831 --> 13:51:55.665
IN A WILD PRICE INTERFACE AREA.

13:51:55.732 --> 13:51:57.133
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT SPRAWL I'M

13:51:57.200 --> 13:51:59.035

OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I COULD

13:53:03.767 --> 13:53:06.202
GO ON BUT I'M NOT BECAUSE THE

13:53:06.269 --> 13:53:09.406
HOUR IS LATE BUT- THE THINK

13:53:09.472 --> 13:53:11.041
CLEAR ACTUALLY COMPROMISES THE

13:53:11.107 --> 13:53:14.711
CHARACTER. AND IT'S CERTAINLY.

13:53:14.778 --> 13:53:17.514
LIMITS LOCAL CONTROL I STRONGLY

13:53:17.580 --> 13:53:20.450
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BUILD

13:53:20.517 --> 13:53:22.919
MORE HOUSING YES SUPPLY IS

13:53:22.986 --> 13:53:25.422
IMPORTANT YES DENSITY WORKS IN

13:53:25.488 --> 13:53:28.692
MANY AREAS. BUT WE CONTINUED TO

13:53:28.758 --> 13:53:30.427
PUT FORWARD THESE BILLS AND WE

13:53:30.493 --> 13:53:32.062
SAY THAT WE NEED AFFORDABLE

13:53:32.128 --> 13:53:33.563
HOUSING AND WE'RE LIVING IN A

13:53:33.630 --> 13:53:36.566
STATE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE

13:53:36.633 --> 13:53:37.801
BEEN DUPED INTO THINKING. THAT

13:53:37.867 --> 13:53:40.337
AFFORDABLE IS PAYING TWELVE

13:53:40.403 --> 13:53:42.172
DOLLARS FOR A CUP OF COFFEE AND

13:53:42.238 --> 13:53:44.974
A DOUGHNUT. THAT IS NOT

13:53:45.041 --> 13:53:46.109
AFFORDABLE THE STATE IS

13:53:46.176 --> 13:53:47.811
BECOMING INCREASINGLY

13:53:47.877 --> 13:53:50.780
UNAFFORDABLE. AND SO RATHER

13:53:50.847 --> 13:53:54.884
THAN. CREATED CREATING A

13:53:54.951 --> 13:53:56.519
DYNAMIC WHERE YOU SET UP.

13:53:56.586 --> 13:53:58.588
ACTUALLY AN INVASION INTO SMALL

13:53:58.655 --> 13:54:00.490
COMMUNITIES BY DEVELOPERS AND

13:54:00.557 --> 13:54:02.592
SPECULATORS WE SHOULD ACTUALLY

13:54:02.659 --> 13:54:04.661
BE HAVING SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS

13:54:04.728 --> 13:54:06.563
ABOUT HOW TO DEVELOP NON MARKET

13:54:06.629 --> 13:54:08.465
PRICE GUARANTEED HOUSING

13:54:08.531 --> 13:54:10.200
BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

13:54:10.266 --> 13:54:12.635
UNITS THAT ARE TEACHERS OUR

13:54:12.702 --> 13:54:14.304
STUDENTS ARE GROCERY WORKERS

13:54:14.371 --> 13:54:16.873
ARE CASHIERS ARE WORKING CLASS

13:54:16.940 --> 13:54:19.976
FAMILIES. AND CALIFORNIANS

13:54:20.043 --> 13:54:22.979
DESERVE NOT. THIS BILL WITH

13:54:23.046 --> 13:54:25.415
QUITE FRANKLY THE KIND OF THE

13:54:25.482 --> 13:54:26.883
FOLKS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO

13:54:26.950 --> 13:54:28.885
PURCHASE THE LAND AND CREATE

13:54:28.952 --> 13:54:31.921
THESE DUPLEXES AND QUAD. ARE

13:54:31.988 --> 13:54:33.456
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT GOING TO

13:54:33.523 --> 13:54:34.858
BE MULTI NATIONAL OR

13:54:34.924 --> 13:54:37.894
INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS.

13:54:37.961 --> 13:54:41.531
CHANGING. THE CHARACTER OF OUR

13:54:41.598 --> 13:54:43.133
COMMUNITY. THIS ISN'T SAYING

13:54:43.199 --> 13:54:44.501
LET'S HAVE ALL BUILDERS LET

13:54:44.567 --> 13:54:45.635
PEOPLE WHO ARE FROM THE

13:54:45.702 --> 13:54:49.139
COMMUNITY. ACTUALLY BUILDING

13:54:49.205 --> 13:54:50.373
LET'S PEOPLE WHO READ THEM

13:54:50.440 --> 13:54:51.474
UNDER THE FABRIC IN THE

13:54:51.541 --> 13:54:53.443
LANDSCAPE OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

13:54:53.510 --> 13:54:55.645
ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

13:54:55.712 --> 13:54:59.048
ACROSS THE FIFTY FOURTH LET

13:54:59.115 --> 13:55:00.583
THEM PARTICIPATE IN THIS. I

13:55:00.650 --> 13:55:03.920
COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT ONE

13:55:03.987 --> 13:55:04.487
HUNDRED A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS

13:55:04.554 --> 13:55:08.658
AGO. WITH ANGELA JOHNSON FORTY

13:55:08.725 --> 13:55:09.726
ACRES AND A MULE AND BLACK

13:55:09.793 --> 13:55:11.127
FOLKS HAVEN'T SOME LAND AND

13:55:11.194 --> 13:55:12.462
THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE IT

13:55:12.529 --> 13:55:14.497
IN FOR CENTURIES FOR YEARS FOR

13:55:14.564 --> 13:55:16.933
GENERATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE

13:55:17.000 --> 13:55:18.601
OUT HOW TO GET THE LAND BACK.

13:55:18.668 --> 13:55:20.570
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE

13:55:20.637 --> 13:55:22.705
DEVELOPERS CALLING YOUR PHONE

13:55:22.772 --> 13:55:24.774
EVERY DAY ASKING IF YOU'D BE

13:55:24.841 --> 13:55:26.576
WILLING TO SELL YOUR PROPERTY.

13:55:26.643 --> 13:55:28.077
AND THEN HAVING APPRAISERS COME

13:55:28.144 --> 13:55:30.146
IN AND UNDER VALUE YOUR

13:55:30.213 --> 13:55:31.781
PROPERTY SO THAT FOLKS CAN GET

13:55:31.848 --> 13:55:33.750
IT AT THE CHEAP. AND HOW THAT

13:55:33.817 --> 13:55:35.218
ALSO ACCELERATES AND

13:55:35.285 --> 13:55:37.554
EXACERBATES GENTRIFICATION AND

13:55:37.620 --> 13:55:40.023
DISPLACEMENT. BUT INSTEAD OF

13:55:40.089 --> 13:55:41.991
TALKING ABOUT THAT I'M GOING TO

13:55:42.058 --> 13:55:43.960
JUST TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

13:55:44.027 --> 13:55:46.062
WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT LEAST

13:55:46.129 --> 13:55:48.264
RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES LIKE

13:55:48.331 --> 13:55:50.333
BE INVENTORY OF LAND THAT THE

13:55:50.400 --> 13:55:55.338
STATE. THE INVENTORY OF LAND

13:55:55.405 --> 13:55:56.639
THAT OUR LOCALITIES AND OUR

13:55:56.706 --> 13:55:59.609
SCHOOL DISTRICT. WE COULD BE

13:55:59.676 --> 13:56:00.810
USING THAT INVENTORY TO BUILD

13:56:00.877 --> 13:56:02.745
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT HOW

13:56:02.812 --> 13:56:05.181
WE'RE TRANSFORMING. YES LIGHT

13:56:05.248 --> 13:56:07.584
COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR. BUT I

13:56:07.650 --> 13:56:09.519
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING

13:56:09.586 --> 13:56:12.155
FOR A INVASION BY DEVELOPERS

13:56:12.222 --> 13:56:14.924
INTO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

13:56:14.991 --> 13:56:19.195
STATE. BECAUSE WE'RE TO LAZY

13:56:19.262 --> 13:56:20.463
QUITE FRANKLY TO HAVE MORE

13:56:20.530 --> 13:56:21.998
MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

13:56:22.065 --> 13:56:22.832
HOW WE'RE PROTECTING

13:56:22.899 --> 13:56:24.834
COMMUNITIES AND FINDING WAYS TO

13:56:24.901 --> 13:56:26.536
BUILD HOUSING THAT PEOPLE TRULY

13:56:26.603 --> 13:56:28.805
CAN AFFORD SO WITH THAT I HAVE

13:56:28.872 --> 13:56:31.608
TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

13:56:31.674 --> 13:56:34.310
VOTE ON SB ELEVEN TWENTY.

13:56:34.377 --> 13:56:38.047
MISTER MATHIS. ALRIGHT MISTER

13:56:38.114 --> 13:56:41.651
SPEAKER THE MR MAYS WAS AHEAD

13:56:41.718 --> 13:56:44.521
OF ME IN LINE YES MIKE UP FOR.

13:56:44.587 --> 13:56:48.491
MEMBERS THERE'S A LOT OF POINTS

13:56:48.558 --> 13:56:51.227
ON THIS BILL THAT I CAN AGREE

13:56:51.294 --> 13:56:53.730
WITH I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT

13:56:53.796 --> 13:56:56.599
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED

13:56:56.666 --> 13:56:59.736
MORE WE NEEDED TO BE AFFORDABLE.

13:56:59.802 --> 13:57:01.871
WELL I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE

13:57:01.938 --> 13:57:03.973
THAT FAMILIES ARE HAVING A HARD

13:57:04.040 --> 13:57:08.111
TIME. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T

13:57:08.177 --> 13:57:12.982
QUITE GET THERE. I THINK

13:57:13.049 --> 13:57:15.485
THERE'S CONSIDERATIONS-

13:57:15.552 --> 13:57:17.654
ESPECIALLY IN OUR VALLEY AREA

13:57:17.720 --> 13:57:20.657
WHEN WE LOOK AT. QUESTIONS OF

13:57:20.723 --> 13:57:23.893
WATER ACCESSIBILITY. WE HAVE

13:57:23.960 --> 13:57:26.095
REGULATIONS LIKE SIGNAL THAT

13:57:26.162 --> 13:57:28.531
ARE COMING INTO AFFECTS. AND

13:57:28.598 --> 13:57:30.867
EVERY YEAR WE GET CUT OFF MORE

13:57:30.934 --> 13:57:36.239
MORE SURFACE WATER. AND WE KNOW

13:57:36.306 --> 13:57:38.675
THAT HOUSING PROJECTS ACTUALLY

13:57:38.741 --> 13:57:39.943
CHIU OF MORE WATER THAN HOUSING

13:57:40.009 --> 13:57:43.212
PRODUCT. WHEN WE GET INTO THE

13:57:43.279 --> 13:57:47.183
CONVERSATIONS OF URBAN SPRAWL.

13:57:47.250 --> 13:57:50.086
AND WE TALK ABOUT PAULINE

13:57:50.153 --> 13:57:52.822
AGRICULTURAL LAND OFF. AND

13:57:52.889 --> 13:57:54.290
HAVING HOUSING PROJECTS TO GO

13:57:54.357 --> 13:57:58.728
UP. IN FOR ALL OF THOSE OF YOU

13:57:58.795 --> 13:58:01.664
WHO LOVE TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE

13:58:01.731 --> 13:58:02.298
CHANGE IN THE THINGS YOU WANT

13:58:02.365 --> 13:58:06.436
TO DO CONSIDER THIS.

13:58:06.502 --> 13:58:09.138
AGRICULTURAL LAND. THAT THESE

13:58:09.205 --> 13:58:11.374
NEW HOUSING PROJECTS WITH

13:58:11.441 --> 13:58:14.644
POSSIBLY CHIU OF. IT'S TEN TO

13:58:14.711 --> 13:58:16.112
FIFTEEN DEGREES COOLER THAN THE

13:58:16.179 --> 13:58:21.517
NEIGHBORHOODS. SO CONSIDER THAT

13:58:21.584 --> 13:58:22.352
ONE. NOW THERE'S A LOT OF

13:58:22.418 --> 13:58:25.321
PIECES ON THIS. A AND I REALLY

13:58:25.388 --> 13:58:27.824
LIKE THE POINT THE THAT WAS

13:58:27.890 --> 13:58:29.892
MADE BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITY.

13:58:29.959 --> 13:58:30.627
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

13:58:30.693 --> 13:58:32.228
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE HAVE A

13:58:32.295 --> 13:58:33.363
LOT OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

13:58:33.429 --> 13:58:37.433
VERY POOR. AND DISENFRANCHISED.

13:58:37.500 --> 13:58:38.034
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE INVESTORS

13:58:38.101 --> 13:58:43.106
COME IN. AND OFFER THEM. MONEY

13:58:43.172 --> 13:58:48.745
AND DO THINGS TO CHASE THEM OUT.

13:58:48.811 --> 13:58:49.278
SO THEY CAN SPLIT UP THESE

13:58:49.345 --> 13:58:51.681
HOMES. THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT

13:58:51.748 --> 13:58:55.051
NEEDS TO BE DONE. NOW IS THE

13:58:55.118 --> 13:58:56.919
HUSBAND OF A REALTOR I'M
