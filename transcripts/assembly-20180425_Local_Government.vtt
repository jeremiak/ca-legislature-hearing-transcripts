LAST YEAR ON THE HOUSING ISSUE

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:38.169 region:rollup2

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
BUT THESE BILLS THAT MEAN VERY

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:48.212 region:rollup2
LITTLE IF THE STATE RINA

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:50.214 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT EQUITABLE

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:52.984 region:rollup2
AND DATA DRIVEN BECAUSE THEY.

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:54.752 region:rollup2
DEPEND ON OUR RINA PROCESS.

00:40:52.984 --> 00:40:56.521 region:rollup2
FAIR AND ACCURATE REALLOCATION

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:58.156 region:rollup2

00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:59.724 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS PLAYING A PART IN

00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:01.793 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IS

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:03.594 region:rollup2
THE MAIN GOAL OF AB SEVENTEEN

00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:05.430 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE. THE EXISTING

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:07.365 region:rollup2
PROCESS TOO OFTEN IGNORES THAT

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
DATA AND ALLOWS LOCAL

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:10.868 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH BACK TO WHAT

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:11.836 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. RATHER

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:14.972 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE WITH CHANGES IN

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.341 region:rollup2
ZONING.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:18.209 region:rollup2
IN AN EFFORT TO ADD AN

00:41:16.341 --> 00:41:20.611 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT VOICE AB SEVENTEEN

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:22.747 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE ADDS EIGHT CD TO THE

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:23.748 region:rollup2
RAIN A PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS THEM

00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:25.917 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:28.019 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY IS

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:30.521 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT ITH THE LAW BEFORE

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:31.122 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN RUN SO THAT

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.322 region:rollup2
THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS TO

00:41:31.122 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
THE.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:34.492 region:rollup2
THE NEXT

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:36.194 region:rollup2
STAGE OF THE PROCESS OR ONE

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:38.096 region:rollup2
STAGE OF THE PROCESS CAN MAKE.

00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:39.630 region:rollup2
ANY NEEDED CHANGES.

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:42.100 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING PROCESS PROVIDES A

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:43.801 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE THAT CAN ALLOW POLITICS

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.336 region:rollup2
TO OVERRIDE PROCESS

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:47.972 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY BUYING CLUED IN

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:51.242 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR. A

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:52.877 region:rollup2
COUNCIL GOVERNMENT TO ADD. A ANY

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:54.312 region:rollup2
OTHER FACTORS TO THEIR

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:56.214 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:57.115 region:rollup2
AT THIS BILL NARROWS THAT

00:41:56.214 --> 00:41:59.550 region:rollup2
DEFINITION SO THAT.

00:41:57.115 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER FACTORS WELCOME.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:04.422 region:rollup2
A AYE KHAGARIA AT A REQUIRES

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:06.424 region:rollup2
THAT ALL FACTORS BE CONSISTENT

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:08.426 region:rollup2
WITH THE GOALS OF THE STATUTE SO

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:09.994 region:rollup2
THAT CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT

00:42:08.426 --> 00:42:12.397 region:rollup2
WILL BE VERY HELPFUL.

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:14.098 region:rollup2
A THIS BILL ALLOWS ORGANIZATIONS

00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:15.233 region:rollup2
TO CHALLENGE RAIN IN NUMBERS AS

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:17.201 region:rollup2
WELL AS SURROUNDING

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:18.770 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS EXISTING GREEN

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:21.239 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS CAN ONLY BE

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.673 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED BY GUESS WHO THE

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.142 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION THAT ASSIGNED THE

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:26.044 region:rollup2
RENUMBER THE FIRST PLACE.

00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:27.545 region:rollup2
IT'S A SYSTEM THAT HASN'T QUITE

00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:29.247 region:rollup2
WORKED FOR US

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.281 region:rollup2
OF THE WAY IT SHOULD IT'S

00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:32.650 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
RENOWNED SETS A AND HOUSING

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:37.288 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION FLOOR NOT A CEILING.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:39.090 region:rollup2
AND RINA AS A PLANNING TOOL

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:40.558 region:rollup2
THAT'S CRITICAL TO SETTING THE

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.794 region:rollup2
STAGE FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION OF

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:43.928 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS ITSELF IS FLAWED.

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:45.897 region:rollup2
THEN WE DON'T GET HOUSING IN THE

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:47.398 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED IN

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.700 region:rollup2
SOME CITIES.

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:50.635 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.637 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING REGIONAL HOUSING

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:54.639 region:rollup2
NEEDS AND THAT'S SIMPLY WRONG

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:56.174 region:rollup2
WHEN JOB RICH JURISDICTIONS

00:42:54.639 --> 00:42:58.276 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO PLAN FOR HOUSING

00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
IT COMPROMISES OUR ABILITY TO

00:42:58.276 --> 00:43:01.312 region:rollup2
MEET OUR CLIMATE CALLS AS WELL.

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:02.380 region:rollup2
SO THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:04.582 region:rollup2
GETTING AN EQUITABLE RINA

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.452 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION WITHIN REGIONS THAT

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:10.955 region:rollup2
INSURERS EVERY JURISDICTION IS

00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:12.857 region:rollup2

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:33.377 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:34.445 region:rollup2
PRODUCE FARMER HOUSING THAN WE

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.580 region:rollup2
HAVE THEN AND PARTICULARLY

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.380 region:rollup2
HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.716 region:rollup2
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.685 region:rollup2
CURRENT SHORTAGE IS BY FAR THE

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:41.919 region:rollup2
MOST ACUTE.

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:42.553 region:rollup2
BUT AS MISS ROOMS THAT IN

00:43:41.919 --> 00:43:43.154 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO PAVING THE WAY FOR

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:43.788 region:rollup2
MORE PRODUCTION GENERALLY WE

00:43:43.154 --> 00:43:44.422 region:rollup2
NEED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO

00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:46.090 region:rollup2
WHERE THE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY

00:43:44.422 --> 00:43:46.991 region:rollup2
NEEDED AND ENSURE THAT THOSE

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.226 region:rollup2
PLACES ARE PROVIDING AMPLE

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:50.461 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:51.829 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT TO OCCUR.

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:53.030 region:rollup2
A HOW THE RING TO GET ALLOCATED

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.599 region:rollup2
WITHIN A REVIEW A REGION IS

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.766 region:rollup2
CRUCIAL TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:57.168 region:rollup2
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN PREPARING

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.002 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT CITIES AND

00:43:57.168 --> 00:43:59.971 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:00.538 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH SITES ON FOR HOUSING

00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:01.572 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR ENTIRE

00:44:00.538 --> 00:44:02.707 region:rollup2
SHARE THE RENOWNED.

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:04.342 region:rollup2
AND IN PARTICULAR TO SO THEY CAN

00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:05.076 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THEIR LOWER INCOME

00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:06.344 region:rollup2
SHARE THEY HAVE HAVE MULTI

00:44:05.076 --> 00:44:08.446 region:rollup2
FAMILY. DANCE SITES.

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:09.780 region:rollup2
.

00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:10.815 region:rollup2
THE LAW RECOGNIZES THE CITIES

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.649 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES GENERALLY AREN'T IN

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:13.251 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS OF HOUSING

00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:14.018 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO PLAY A

00:44:13.251 --> 00:44:15.319 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ROLE THROUGH THEIR

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:16.888 region:rollup2
SENDING POWERS AND SETTING THE

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:18.523 region:rollup2
STAGE FOR DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN.

00:44:16.888 --> 00:44:19.790 region:rollup2
I THE LAW PROVIDES A LOT OF

00:44:18.523 --> 00:44:21.425 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:22.260 region:rollup2
BOTH HURDLE IN MARKET RATE THAT

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:24.195 region:rollup2
ARE PROPOSED ON SITES THAT HAVE

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.196 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR HOUSING.

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:26.397 region:rollup2
THOSE PROTECTIONS WERE ENHANCE

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:27.465 region:rollup2
QUIT LAST YEAR THROUGH A NUMBER

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:28.599 region:rollup2
OF BILLS ON HOUSING PACKAGE

00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:29.901 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY IF A DEVELOPER

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:31.769 region:rollup2
PROPOSES A HOUSING PROJECT

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:33.070 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN A LOCATION THAT IS

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:34.605 region:rollup2
ZONED FOR HOUSING ALREADY.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.474 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THAT PROJECT

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:37.642 region:rollup2
TO GET TONIGHT HOWEVER NO THESE

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:38.910 region:rollup2
LAWS CAN COMPEL PRODUCTION OF

00:44:37.642 --> 00:44:40.178 region:rollup2
HOUSING A PLACE IS WHERE THERE

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.379 region:rollup2
IS LITTLE OR NO LEON SOUND FOR

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:43.014 region:rollup2
HOUSING IF A JURISDICTION GETS A

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:44.115 region:rollup2
LORENA NUMBER THAT EFFECTIVELY

00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.616 region:rollup2
CAN MEAN THAT THE JURISDICTION

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:46.817 region:rollup2
CAN SHUT THE DOOR. FOR HOUSING

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:48.219 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEXT DECADE

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:49.320 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT'S AN IDEAL LOCATION

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:50.855 region:rollup2
FOR NEW HOUSING.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.957 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL TO

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:53.724 region:rollup2
GET THE REALLOCATION RIGHT.

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:55.193 region:rollup2
THE RENO SUPPOSED TO BE

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:56.227 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OF A DATA DRIVEN WAY

00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:57.595 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS A VARIETY OF

00:44:56.227 --> 00:44:59.096 region:rollup2
STATUTORY GOALS UNFORTUNATELY

00:44:57.595 --> 00:45:00.765 region:rollup2
REGIONAL POLITICS TAKE OVER

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:02.333 region:rollup2
RESULTING IN LOWALLOCATIONS TO

00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:02.833 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT COULD AND

00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:03.834 region:rollup2
NEED TO ACCOMMODATE MORE

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.869 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.037 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN OVERLY HIGH

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:07.204 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER

00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:08.005 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WHERE THAT

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.340 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.174 region:rollup2
A LOT OF SENSE AND IS UNLIKELY

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.577 region:rollup2
TO OCCUR BECAUSE OF MARKET

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS LACK OF JOBS A WHOLE

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:15.479 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF OTHER FACTORS.

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.681 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GONNA START LOOKING AT

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:17.982 region:rollup2
HOW CLOSE PRODUCTION COMES IN

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:19.183 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES TO MATCHING

00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:20.885 region:rollup2
THEIR RENO SHARE AND USE THAT AS

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:22.720 region:rollup2
A. GAUGE FOR DEFINING SUCCESS

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:24.188 region:rollup2
AND FAILURE. AS WE DID LAST YEAR

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.823 region:rollup2
WITH SB THIRTY FIVE THAT WE HAVE

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:27.959 region:rollup2
TO START BY ENSURING THAT THE

00:45:25.823 --> 00:45:29.594 region:rollup2
REALLOCATION MAKES SENSE.

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:30.094 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO

00:45:29.594 --> 00:45:31.229 region:rollup2
CREATE MORE WORK FOR THE

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:32.296 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:45:31.229 --> 00:45:33.431 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RINA

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:35.499 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS ALREADY RATHER TIME

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:37.301 region:rollup2
CONSUMING FOR THE COGS.

00:45:35.499 --> 00:45:38.669 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T CREATE ANY MORE

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:40.004 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THEM BUT.

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:41.072 region:rollup2
THE GOAL IS TO TAKE POLITICS

00:45:40.004 --> 00:45:42.440 region:rollup2
OUT ENSURE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:43.407 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES WHERE MORE

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:46.477 region:rollup2
HOUSING MAKES SENSE ARE ASKED TO

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:47.411 region:rollup2
DO THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE'RE

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.512 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.747 region:rollup2
WITH THE CARDS MAY FOR THE BILL

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:51.649 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ADD TIME AND MORE WORK

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:52.717 region:rollup2
AND DOESN'T CREATE CONFLICT

00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:54.118 region:rollup2
BETWEEN CLIMATE GOALS AN EQUABLE

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:56.220 region:rollup2
THE. EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:57.488 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE THINK THAT IF WE GET

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.756 region:rollup2
THE REAL ALLOCATIONS RATE IT

00:45:57.488 --> 00:46:00.191 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE AN OVERALL BENEFIT IN

00:45:58.756 --> 00:46:02.560 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MEETING CHICHI

00:46:00.191 --> 00:46:03.227 region:rollup2
REDUCTION TARGETS.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.761 region:rollup2
WELL I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.762 region:rollup2
FROM BOTH STAKEHOLDERS AND

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.497 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT

00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:08.132 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO THE PROCESS FOR

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.033 region:rollup2
APPEALING A REALLOCATION. AND A

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:10.534 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR OPENING UP THAT

00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:11.068 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO CHALLENGES FROM

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:12.570 region:rollup2
ENTITIES OTHER THAN LOCAL

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:13.504 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.072 region:rollup2
WHILE WE DO THINK EXISTING

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:16.307 region:rollup2
APPEAL PROCESS IS FLAWED WERE

00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:17.742 region:rollup2
DEATHLY OPENED OTHER APPROACHES

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:18.576 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT HOPE THAT IN THE END

00:46:17.742 --> 00:46:20.044 region:rollup2
WE CAN COME UP WITH A PROCESS

00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:21.379 region:rollup2
THAT'S BOTH LESS TIME CONSUMING

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:22.580 region:rollup2
THAN THE ONE THAT EXISTS NOW AND

00:46:21.379 --> 00:46:23.714 region:rollup2
MORE FAIR.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.982 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY PLACING

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:26.651 region:rollup2
MORE SCRUTINY ON THE DEVELOPMENT

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.618 region:rollup2
OF THE READ A METHODOLOGY ITSELF

00:46:26.651 --> 00:46:28.152 region:rollup2
THERE'LL BE LESS NEED FOR

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.086 region:rollup2
APPEALS AT THE END OF THE

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.554 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:32.223 region:rollup2
OTHERS CLEARLY MARKED COME ON

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:33.491 region:rollup2

00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:30.107 region:rollup2
SHE TOOK ALL MY LINES.

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
BUT DO A COUPLE THINGS BECAUSE

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:32.243 region:rollup2
OUR MANY OF BECAUSE ARE ALSO THE

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:33.711 region:rollup2
METROPOLITAN PLANNING

00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:34.912 region:rollup2

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:37.715 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THEIR PLANS UNDER S.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE MY CLIMATE

00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:41.986 region:rollup2
REDUCTION PLANS.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:43.521 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT RECONCILIATION POINT

00:48:41.986 --> 00:48:45.423 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TWO IS VERY

00:48:43.521 --> 00:48:47.057 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE.

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:48.459 region:rollup2
IF CHARGED AS THE LEGISLATURE A

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:50.428 region:rollup2

00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:53.798 region:rollup2

DISTRIBUTION. AND EIGHT CITIES

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ON IT. AND WE THINK

00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:05.209 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE ARE APPROVED THINGS

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:06.777 region:rollup2
COULD CONFLICTS SOMETIMES IN

00:49:05.209 --> 00:49:08.279 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:10.381 region:rollup2
TARGET AND WE DO NEED A WAY TO

00:49:08.279 --> 00:49:11.048 region:rollup2
FIGURE THAT OUT. WOULD ALSO

00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:13.050 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT.

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:14.718 region:rollup2
CLOGS.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.554 region:rollup2
DO NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING SO WE

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:18.122 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE FOR THE RING UP SO WE

00:49:16.554 --> 00:49:20.791 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE THE.

00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:22.193 region:rollup2
NOT MAKING THIS MORE DIFFICULT

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.561 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE PROHIBITED BY THE

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:24.662 region:rollup2
COMMISSION STATE MANDATES PER

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.729 region:rollup2
GETTING ANY KIND OF MANDATE

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:26.897 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE WORK THAT

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:29.066 region:rollup2
WE DO.

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:30.501 region:rollup2
AND SO WE APPRECIATE THAT

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:32.203 region:rollup2
FINALLY ON THIS COMMITTEE IN

00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:34.438 region:rollup2

THE PROCESS OF APPEALING AND

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:44.582 region:rollup2

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:04.134 region:rollup2
COORDINATED.

AND ADDING TIME AND DELAY TO

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:07.505 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS COULD DELAY THE OUT

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:09.773 region:rollup2

SERVICE.

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:30.047 region:rollup2
ON THE COASTER ANYMORE THAN THEY

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:31.581 region:rollup2
HAVE MEAN IT'S WAY OUT IN THE

00:57:30.047 --> 00:57:33.617 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.818 region:rollup2

EIGHT YEARS A DURING THAT TIME

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:41.058 region:rollup2
WAS APPROACH MULTIPLE TIMES BY

IN CT TO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL OF.

00:57:41.058 --> 00:57:44.661 region:rollup2
A TRAIN PLATFORM AT THE

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:45.429 region:rollup2
CONVENTION CENTER BY THAT WOULD

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:46.296 region:rollup2
BE AN EXPANSION OF SERVICES

00:57:45.429 --> 00:57:47.931 region:rollup2
DEEPER INTO THE HEART OF

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:49.599 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO BUT IS NOT

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:50.968 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IMPACTS BY AND IS NOT A

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:52.970 region:rollup2
PRODUCT OF THE EASILY EXECUTE IT

00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:54.237 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE. I THINK DIRECT

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.373 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:57.040 region:rollup2
AND THIS AGENCY AGAIN I'M NOT

00:57:56.373 --> 00:57:58.675 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED THERE'S A BAD

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.543 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE BUT

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:01.278 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS HAVE A

00:57:59.543 --> 00:58:02.045 region:rollup2
DEEPER RELATIONSHIP ONE THAT

00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:03.547 region:rollup2
ALLOWS FOR MORE FREQUENT

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:05.248 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION. NOT THE AD HOC

00:58:03.547 --> 00:58:06.483 region:rollup2
INFORMAL NATURE THAT WE HAVE NOW

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.784 region:rollup2
THAT FRANKLY.

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.052 region:rollup2
ALMOST IS PUBLIC FIND ON

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:10.487 region:rollup2
CERTAIN DAYS DOESN'T REALLY HELP

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:11.655 region:rollup2
AND JANET HER NEIGHBORS ARE

00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:13.123 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE

00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:14.591 region:rollup2
OF THAT A GIVEN SOME OF THE.

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:16.827 region:rollup2
I THINK QUALITY BY CONCERNS IF

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:18.261 region:rollup2
THEY EXPERIENCE DALY TODAY IN

00:58:16.827 --> 00:58:19.730 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. THIS ONE I

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:21.465 region:rollup2
SERVED ON THE BOARD WAS AT THAT

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:26.136 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN THE DISTRICTS WOULD

00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:27.170 region:rollup2
CHANGE MT DB AT THE TIME AND

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:28.338 region:rollup2
NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT.

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.273 region:rollup2

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.807 region:rollup2

A LOT OF THE PLANNING SO AS FAR

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.449 region:rollup2
AS THE SERVICE IN THE PLANNING

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:41.151 region:rollup2
AND ALL THAT IT'S ALREADY

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.753 region:rollup2
REGIONAL.

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:44.621 region:rollup2

BRINGING SOMEONE ON A BOARD THAT

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
WE ALREADY HAVE THAT REGIONAL

00:58:46.123 --> 00:58:49.259 region:rollup2

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.228 region:rollup2
FROM THE AND.

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:52.362 region:rollup2

THE EASIEST WAY TO STOP A

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
PROJECT IS NOT TO DENY IT.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:29.746 region:rollup2

THE WHOLE.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:31.754 region:rollup2
MY I HAVE A HUGE SECTION

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:33.689 region:rollup2
PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF MY

01:21:31.754 --> 01:21:36.191 region:rollup2

01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:38.093 region:rollup2

THAT HIGH.

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:52.274 region:rollup2
SO HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:55.577 region:rollup2
DISTRICT LIKE THAT LET'S VERY

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:57.746 region:rollup2
RURAL.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:22:00.949 region:rollup2
ARM AND SO.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:02.117 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BIGGEST AYE AGNEW.

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:03.452 region:rollup2
THE BASE SUCCESS STORIES IN

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:05.087 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGE IN THIS

01:22:03.452 --> 01:22:05.988 region:rollup2
OUR RULE COMMUNITIES ARE BRISTOL

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:07.356 region:rollup2
VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:08.590 region:rollup2

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:17.266 region:rollup2
METROPOLITAN AREAS.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:18.734 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S PURELY A MATTER OF OF

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.669 region:rollup2
YOU POLITICAL WILL I WILL IN

01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:22.704 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY OF OF YOUR HIRING

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:23.639 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE NECESSARY. AND IT DOES

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:25.407 region:rollup2
TAKE AN INVESTMENT AND LOCAL

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:26.675 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AYE THERE ARE LOTS OF

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:28.310 region:rollup2
WILL COMMUNITIES OF IT INC FACE

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.178 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WOULD YOU TALK A KIND

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.445 region:rollup2
OF FEELING DAY.

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:32.681 region:rollup2

HANDS.

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:40.122 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE REALITY IS

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:41.623 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF OF OF HEAVY

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:42.491 region:rollup2

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:54.002 region:rollup2
A A THE LIKELY ONLY SALUTE

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:55.671 region:rollup2

SITUATION AND THEY GOT TO IT TO

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:33.642 region:rollup2

APPLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:46:25.646 --> 01:46:28.682 region:rollup2
HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO

01:46:27.448 --> 01:46:30.885 region:rollup2

MOST JURISDICTIONS HOWEVER

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:55.175 region:rollup2
CANNOT AFFORD TO FUND AND STAFF

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.410 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN ETHICS CAN.

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:58.012 region:rollup2

CAMPAIGN ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:03.517 region:rollup2
FALLS TO THE CITY ATTORNEY OR

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:05.185 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RESPECTIVELY.

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:06.520 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT LOCAL ENFORCEMENT

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:08.055 region:rollup2
TENDS TO BE RARE AS ASSEMBLYMAN

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:09.690 region:rollup2
HARPER MENTIONED.

01:47:08.055 --> 01:47:11.358 region:rollup2
CITY ATTORNEY'S INDIA IS DO NOT

ENFORCING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:16.196 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES

01:47:14.328 --> 01:47:17.631 region:rollup2
COMPETING FOR THEIR ATTENTION.

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:19.133 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE A CAMPAIGN

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:21.035 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION LIMIT VIOLATION IS

01:47:19.133 --> 01:47:22.703 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO MERIT DE A RESOURCES

FOR PROSECUTION WHEN COMPARED TO

01:47:22.703 --> 01:47:26.307 region:rollup2
A VIOLENT CRIME.

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:27.775 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THERE IS ALSO A

01:47:26.307 --> 01:47:29.176 region:rollup2
RISK OF APPARENT POLITICAL BIAS

01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:30.577 region:rollup2
IF AN APPOINTED CITY ATTORNEY

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:32.546 region:rollup2

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:34.181 region:rollup2
INCUMBENT OR IF ELECTED DISTRICT

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:36.450 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY BRINGS CHARGES AGAINST

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:37.551 region:rollup2
A POLITICAL RIVAL.

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.986 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ALLOWS

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:40.387 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT A

01:47:38.986 --> 01:47:42.423 region:rollup2
BETTER MODEL FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN

ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT.

01:47:42.423 --> 01:47:45.893 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE I PP C. SPECIALIZES

01:47:44.358 --> 01:47:47.428 region:rollup2
IN CAMPAIGN ENFORCEMENT AND USES

01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:48.963 region:rollup2
AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

01:47:47.428 --> 01:47:50.497 region:rollup2
AB PPC ENFORCEMENT PROVIDE

01:47:48.963 --> 01:47:52.032 region:rollup2
STREAMLINED AND EFFICIENT

01:47:50.497 --> 01:47:53.233 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ENFORCEMENT AT A

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:55.569 region:rollup2

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:59.306 region:rollup2
MOREOVER THEFT PPC IS RESPECTED

01:47:57.604 --> 01:48:00.975 region:rollup2
AS AN IMPARTIAL BODY MAKING

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.876 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS LESS

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:05.079 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL MOVE THE BILL.

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:06.113 region:rollup2
IN CONCLUSION AB TWENTY EIGHT

01:48:05.079 --> 01:48:07.414 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT

01:48:06.113 --> 01:48:08.782 region:rollup2
FORCE AN OPTION TO MAKE LOCAL

ORDINANCES MORE EASILY AND

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:13.053 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEABLE.

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:14.455 region:rollup2

BUT.

02:08:58.431 --> 02:09:03.936 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT WAS MORE OF

02:09:01.234 --> 02:09:05.404 region:rollup2
AN OVERSIGHT IF ANYTHING. A.

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:07.240 region:rollup2

FEDERAL AND STATE BUILDINGS AND.

02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:21.854 region:rollup2
SCHOOL FACILITIES BECAUSE ALL

THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THEM.

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:31.230 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS.

02:09:29.028 --> 02:09:32.498 region:rollup2
BUT HISTORICAL. NOT NOT IN THE

02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:35.935 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:38.104 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:09:35.935 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW I COULD FEEL ENOUGH

02:09:38.104 --> 02:09:40.873 region:rollup2
THAT. ASSEMBLYMAN OF MANY OF THE

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:42.208 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL BUILDINGS IN

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:45.278 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARE UNREINFORCED

02:09:42.208 --> 02:09:46.345 region:rollup2
MASONRY AND THEY WERE ALREADY

02:09:45.278 --> 02:09:47.413 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED BY A PREVIOUS.

02:09:46.345 --> 02:09:48.547 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATION

02:09:47.413 --> 02:09:50.483 region:rollup2
DOESN'T FOCUS ON UNREINFORCED

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:52.385 region:rollup2
MASONRY BUILDINGS

02:09:50.483 --> 02:09:53.386 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THOSE AREN'T SO SOME

02:09:52.385 --> 02:09:53.986 region:rollup2
OF THOSE HISTORIC BUILDINGS

02:09:53.386 --> 02:09:54.920 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:56.956 region:rollup2
LETTER.

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.424 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:59.558 region:rollup2
SO THEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY

02:09:58.424 --> 02:10:01.127 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR NOT SUPPORTING THE

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:02.795 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:10:01.127 --> 02:10:04.096 region:rollup2
WHEN I'VE THAT'S WHY ONE OF LET

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:05.298 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAD TALKED

02:10:04.096 --> 02:10:07.066 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:08.534 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW OLDER CITIES MANY

02:10:07.066 --> 02:10:09.101 region:rollup2
OF WHICH YOU KNOW CLOSING THE

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:10.836 region:rollup2
CITY OF ESCONDIDO AS ONE OF

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:12.738 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:10:10.836 --> 02:10:16.409 region:rollup2
INCORPORATED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:16.909 region:rollup2
EIGHT THE WHOLE URBAN CORE.

02:10:16.409 --> 02:10:18.477 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THEM THE DEATH

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:20.112 region:rollup2
HISTORIC DOWNTOWN AND THAT WHOLE

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:21.547 region:rollup2
AREA HAS BUILDINGS THAT WERE

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:23.115 region:rollup2
BUILT.

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:25.184 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:27.320 region:rollup2
FIFTIES IN FACT THE BUILDING

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:28.387 region:rollup2
WHERE MY BUSINESS WAS SIDES WAS

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:31.824 region:rollup2
BUILT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY.

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:32.591 region:rollup2
.

02:10:31.824 --> 02:10:36.462 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN.

02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:36.462 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO

02:10:36.529 --> 02:10:40.700 region:rollup2
AREA THE SEWER SYSTEMS

02:10:37.897 --> 02:10:42.735 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IS OUTDATED BUT.

02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:44.737 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO I MEAN LITERALLY

02:10:42.735 --> 02:10:46.105 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE URBAN FOR WOULD BE

02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:48.007 region:rollup2
PART OF CONSIDERED VULNERABLE

02:10:46.105 --> 02:10:51.343 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT.

02:10:48.007 --> 02:10:54.814 region:rollup2
IT THIS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT.

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:55.281 region:rollup2
PARSEE. HAS. A LARGE.

02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:57.750 region:rollup2
SEGMENT OF LOW INCOME

02:10:55.281 --> 02:10:59.685 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

02:10:57.750 --> 02:11:02.922 region:rollup2
HERE THIS WOULD IMPACT.

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:04.824 region:rollup2
THEM FINANCIALLY AS WELL BECAUSE

02:11:02.922 --> 02:11:06.726 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY IS YOU KNOW YOUR BILL

02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:08.427 region:rollup2
AS TRYING TO GET THE LIST PUT

02:11:06.726 --> 02:11:10.396 region:rollup2
TOGETHER ONCE THAT'S THERE IT

02:11:08.427 --> 02:11:13.165 region:rollup2
ALMOST CREATES A STIGMA OF SORTS

02:11:10.396 --> 02:11:14.600 region:rollup2
ONTO THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:16.135 region:rollup2
I COULD NEVER SELL IT UNLESS IT

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.104 region:rollup2
GETS FIXED EVEN THOUGH IT MAY

02:11:16.135 --> 02:11:19.805 region:rollup2
END UP NOT REALLY NEEDING TO BE

02:11:18.104 --> 02:11:22.641 region:rollup2
RETROFITTED SO.

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:25.111 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE MY CONCERNS AND Y. I

02:11:22.641 --> 02:11:27.413 region:rollup2
HAD VOTED LOW CHAIR OKAY.

02:11:25.111 --> 02:11:29.115 region:rollup2
BUT HE WON.

02:11:27.413 --> 02:11:30.883 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>THAT THAT'S A VERY FAIR</c></u>

02:11:29.115 --> 02:11:33.319 region:rollup2
CONCERNED AND I THANK YOU FOR

02:11:30.883 --> 02:11:34.587 region:rollup2
RAISING THAT HIGH OBVIOUSLY THE

02:11:33.319 --> 02:11:36.756 region:rollup2
INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO

02:11:34.587 --> 02:11:38.591 region:rollup2
PUT ANY ONE LOCAL JURISDICTION.

02:11:36.756 --> 02:11:41.127 region:rollup2
UNDER SUCH

02:11:38.591 --> 02:11:43.396 region:rollup2
DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES TO NOT MAKE

02:11:41.127 --> 02:11:47.233 region:rollup2
THE MEET CERTAIN GOALS. IN FACT

02:11:43.396 --> 02:11:49.335 region:rollup2
IDEA. HAVE WANTED TO.

02:11:47.233 --> 02:11:51.103 region:rollup2
LOOK AT MAYBE A AT AND THIS IS

02:11:49.335 --> 02:11:52.605 region:rollup2
WHY MAYBE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:54.039 region:rollup2
TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE.

02:11:52.605 --> 02:11:56.509 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF THE REALTORS.

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:57.743 region:rollup2
AT THE THE BILL ITSELF HAS

02:11:56.509 --> 02:12:00.045 region:rollup2
THREE COMPONENTS IT'S THE

02:11:57.743 --> 02:12:01.080 region:rollup2
INVENTORY IT'S THE EVALUATION

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:02.314 region:rollup2
AND THE MITIGATION THE

02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:04.517 region:rollup2
MEDICATION OBVIOUSLY BEING THE

02:12:02.314 --> 02:12:06.652 region:rollup2
MOST COSTLY. THE EVALUATION

02:12:04.517 --> 02:12:09.255 region:rollup2
HAVING COST TO IT BECAUSE OF

02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:11.157 region:rollup2
HAVING TWO. OF THE FOUR PROPERTY

02:12:09.255 --> 02:12:12.491 region:rollup2
OWNER TO ATTAIN A STRUCTURAL.

02:12:11.157 --> 02:12:13.592 region:rollup2
ENGINEER AND GOING THROUGH THE

02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:15.995 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:17.496 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE INVENTORY IS.

02:12:15.995 --> 02:12:19.899 region:rollup2
THE RELATIVELY MOST COST

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:21.967 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE BILL

02:12:19.899 --> 02:12:23.436 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE.

02:12:21.967 --> 02:12:24.904 region:rollup2
HEARING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS

02:12:23.436 --> 02:12:26.639 region:rollup2
HEARING THE CONCERN FROM THE

02:12:24.904 --> 02:12:28.040 region:rollup2
REALTORS ALSO.

02:12:26.639 --> 02:12:30.543 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING THE

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.945 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS WHAT WHAT TO OF THE

02:12:30.543 --> 02:12:34.213 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ARE FINE. BUT.

02:12:32.945 --> 02:12:36.415 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF TAKING THE THIRD

02:12:34.213 --> 02:12:38.584 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT MY GOAL WAS MAYBE EVEN

02:12:36.415 --> 02:12:40.252 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN SPLIT THE

02:12:38.584 --> 02:12:42.888 region:rollup2
BILL INTO TWO BILLS.

02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:45.724 region:rollup2
PASS ONE PORTION THIS YEAR.

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:47.426 region:rollup2
THAT AT LEAST CREATES AN

02:12:45.724 --> 02:12:48.961 region:rollup2
INVENTORY OF THE BUILDINGS AND

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:51.130 region:rollup2
THEN THINK ABOUT THE EVALUATION

02:12:48.961 --> 02:12:52.531 region:rollup2
AND THE MITIGATION.

02:12:51.130 --> 02:12:53.299 region:rollup2
AND IN THE FUTURE HERE

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:55.467 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE

02:12:53.299 --> 02:12:57.970 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED THE DATABASE OF THE

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:59.605 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS AS WELL SO. YEAH I AM

02:12:57.970 --> 02:13:00.639 region:rollup2
SHARING THIS SO THAT YOU KNOW

02:12:59.605 --> 02:13:03.075 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S.

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:04.543 region:rollup2
A LOT OF.

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:06.111 region:rollup2
AND WAYS OF APPROACHING THIS AND

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:09.415 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:11.217 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS.

02:13:09.415 --> 02:13:12.585 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BOTTOM.

02:13:11.217 --> 02:13:15.187 region:rollup2
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL

02:13:12.585 --> 02:13:16.922 region:rollup2
IS TO ENSURE THAT. A INVENTORY

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:19.124 region:rollup2
LIST ALSO.

02:13:16.922 --> 02:13:20.259 region:rollup2
IS MOVED FORWARD WITH SO THAT WE

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:21.927 region:rollup2
AT LEAST KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING

02:13:20.259 --> 02:13:23.362 region:rollup2
WITH THEN AND I WON ALSO

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:25.264 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THAT ONCE AND

02:13:23.362 --> 02:13:27.032 region:rollup2
INVENTORY IS DONE. IT DOESN'T

02:13:25.264 --> 02:13:28.834 region:rollup2
BRING ABOUT.

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:30.202 region:rollup2
.

02:13:28.834 --> 02:13:31.637 region:rollup2
A LIABILITY FOR THE BUILDING

02:13:30.202 --> 02:13:33.272 region:rollup2
OWNERS

02:13:31.637 --> 02:13:33.839 region:rollup2
WHEN THE BUILDING OWNERS.

02:13:33.272 --> 02:13:35.407 region:rollup2
PURCHASED THE BUILDING THEY

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:38.377 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

02:13:35.407 --> 02:13:40.346 region:rollup2
JUST THE LIABILITY WITH IT.

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:41.380 region:rollup2
SO I I I THAT I JUST WANT TO

02:13:40.346 --> 02:13:42.648 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT A

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:43.782 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

02:13:42.648 --> 02:13:45.885 region:rollup2
IF IF IT WAS IN THE BACK OF YOUR

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:47.620 region:rollup2
MIND.

02:13:45.885 --> 02:13:48.754 region:rollup2
OKAY THIS WITH YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:50.155 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T SPEAK

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:52.124 region:rollup2
ENGLISH.

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:54.126 region:rollup2
SO THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED.

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:56.529 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS ONCE.

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:59.365 region:rollup2
IF PROPERTY LISTED.

02:13:56.529 --> 02:14:01.901 region:rollup2
AS A VULNERABLE BUILDING.

02:13:59.365 --> 02:14:03.769 region:rollup2
THEN WOULD THE INSURANCE COMPANY

02:14:01.901 --> 02:14:05.938 region:rollup2
THE HAND SURE IS THAT WOULD BE

02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:08.073 region:rollup2
NOTIFIED. THAT IT WAS NOW ON THE

02:14:05.938 --> 02:14:09.275 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE LIST I MEAN THAT

02:14:08.073 --> 02:14:12.144 region:rollup2
COULD BE AN ISSUE PEOPLE.

02:14:09.275 --> 02:14:14.113 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:14:12.144 --> 02:14:15.381 region:rollup2
I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT FOLKS IN A

02:14:14.113 --> 02:14:17.416 region:rollup2
WHO CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A

02:14:15.381 --> 02:14:19.685 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL ENGINEER WHO ARE NOT

02:14:17.416 --> 02:14:22.388 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF

02:14:19.685 --> 02:14:23.789 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT THINGS GOING ON.

02:14:22.388 --> 02:14:25.457 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT I NEED TO

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:27.026 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THIS TO JUST MENTION

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:28.761 region:rollup2
IT BUT YOU KNOW NOW WHERE DOES

02:14:27.026 --> 02:14:30.963 region:rollup2
THAT SAY WE COME IN WITH%

02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:32.731 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES NOW WHO. ARE

02:14:30.963 --> 02:14:34.333 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT PROPERTY. OKAY

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:36.168 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF ONLY LIST THEY

02:14:34.333 --> 02:14:38.637 region:rollup2
MAY SAY ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:40.573 region:rollup2
IN A HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IT IS

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:42.908 region:rollup2
A HEN HAS CANDEAL. OKAY HANDS

02:14:40.573 --> 02:14:46.078 region:rollup2
OFF THAT PROPERTY CAN'T BE LIVED

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:47.146 region:rollup2
IN AND TOLD WHEN INSURANCES OR

02:14:46.078 --> 02:14:48.247 region:rollup2
THAT STRUCTURES.

02:14:47.146 --> 02:14:50.316 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE WHETHER IT'S

02:14:48.247 --> 02:14:50.950 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE ON NOT ULTIMATELY. I

02:14:50.316 --> 02:14:52.384 region:rollup2
CAN RESPOND TO THAT ASSEMBLYMAN

02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:54.053 region:rollup2
AND.

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:55.454 region:rollup2
I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH THE

02:14:54.053 --> 02:14:57.022 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES NGUYEN DAY

02:14:55.454 --> 02:14:58.691 region:rollup2
ENSURE A BUILDING THEY ACTUALLY

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:59.892 region:rollup2
GET MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON

02:14:58.691 --> 02:15:01.460 region:rollup2
THE BUILDING THEN

02:14:59.892 --> 02:15:02.628 region:rollup2
IT'S BILL WOULD EVEN REQUIRE A

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:04.263 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT INFORMATION ISN'T

02:15:02.628 --> 02:15:06.065 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SO.

02:15:04.263 --> 02:15:07.433 region:rollup2
STATE IS NEVER ACCESS TO IT BUT

02:15:06.065 --> 02:15:08.567 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES UNDERSTAND

02:15:07.433 --> 02:15:10.336 region:rollup2
THE AGE OF THE BUILDING THE

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:11.937 region:rollup2
MATERIAL WAS MADE OUT OF AND

02:15:10.336 --> 02:15:13.305 region:rollup2
GENERALLY WHETHER IT'S ON THEIR

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:14.373 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF A BOOK VULNERABLE LEST

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:15.808 region:rollup2
AND THAT CERTAINLY GOES TOWARDS

02:15:14.373 --> 02:15:17.076 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY GET THEIR QUICK

02:15:15.808 --> 02:15:19.111 region:rollup2
INSURANCE CANNOT AFFORD IT.

02:15:17.076 --> 02:15:20.779 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT ISSUE IS SORT

02:15:19.111 --> 02:15:22.314 region:rollup2
OF ALREADY IMBEDDED INTO WHAT

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:23.415 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES GET A IN

02:15:22.314 --> 02:15:24.650 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE COST OF THE

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:26.251 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. AYE IN

02:15:24.650 --> 02:15:27.186 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS

02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:28.220 region:rollup2
INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE

02:15:27.186 --> 02:15:30.489 region:rollup2
INTERESTED MAKING SURE THERE'S

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:32.658 region:rollup2
NOT A LARGE BURDEN ON THE OWNER.

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:34.460 region:rollup2
AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN SAID THIS

02:15:32.658 --> 02:15:37.162 region:rollup2
BILL IS PRIMARY EIGHT PRIMARILY

02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:38.530 region:rollup2
IN INVENTORY WITH A VERY SHORT

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:40.833 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY LITTLE IT TWO PAGE

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:42.568 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT THAT FEMA PRODUCES.

02:15:40.833 --> 02:15:43.969 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE FILLED OUT BY AN

02:15:42.568 --> 02:15:45.337 region:rollup2
ENGINEER THAT TAKES MAYBE

02:15:43.969 --> 02:15:46.305 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MINUTES TO A HALF AN

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:48.307 region:rollup2
HOUR TO COMPLETE.

02:15:46.305 --> 02:15:50.242 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE THE INTENDED

02:15:48.307 --> 02:15:51.944 region:rollup2
SORT OF ASSESSMENT OR ADDITIONAL

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:52.544 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OF THE BUILDING THAT

02:15:51.944 --> 02:15:54.113 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GATHERED THAT WOULD

02:15:52.544 --> 02:15:55.414 region:rollup2
HELP. PROVIDE A LOT OF

02:15:54.113 --> 02:15:57.282 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND HOW

02:15:55.414 --> 02:15:59.451 region:rollup2
THE THAT THE CITY IN THE STATE

02:15:57.282 --> 02:16:00.986 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO PERFORM YOU KNOW IN

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:01.954 region:rollup2
A HOLE OUT WITH AN EARTHQUAKE.

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:02.755 region:rollup2
SO I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES AT

02:16:01.954 --> 02:16:07.826 region:rollup2
LEAST LIMIT THE COST FOR THE

02:16:02.755 --> 02:16:09.828 region:rollup2
ENGINEER.

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:11.363 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY CABALLERO. THANK YOU

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:14.033 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. WE HAD A

02:16:11.363 --> 02:16:16.435 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS OF BILL

02:16:14.033 --> 02:16:17.603 region:rollup2
I HAVE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS

02:16:16.435 --> 02:16:19.071 region:rollup2
THAT MISS WALDRON HAS.

02:16:17.603 --> 02:16:19.571 region:rollup2
.

02:16:19.071 --> 02:16:21.306 region:rollup2
HAVING GONE THROUGH THE.

02:16:19.571 --> 02:16:22.408 region:rollup2
.

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:24.910 region:rollup2
UNREINFORCED MASONRY.

02:16:22.408 --> 02:16:27.946 region:rollup2
.

02:16:24.910 --> 02:16:29.415 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN A CITY THAT WAS

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:30.983 region:rollup2
BUILT IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS

02:16:29.415 --> 02:16:31.216 region:rollup2
WITH A LOT OF UNREINFORCED

02:16:30.983 --> 02:16:32.317 region:rollup2
MASONRY.

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:33.852 region:rollup2
.

02:16:32.317 --> 02:16:35.988 region:rollup2
AT WORK.

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:38.490 region:rollup2
AND IT TOOK THE CITY OF SALINAS

02:16:35.988 --> 02:16:39.425 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS TO GET COMPLIANCE

02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:39.692 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OUR DOWNTOWN WAS

02:16:39.425 --> 02:16:42.628 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

02:16:39.692 --> 02:16:44.630 region:rollup2
.

02:16:42.628 --> 02:16:46.198 region:rollup2
AS OLD DOWNTOWNS TEND TO WITH

02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:48.067 region:rollup2
VACANCIES AND.

02:16:46.198 --> 02:16:49.802 region:rollup2
SO WAS A REAL CHALLENGE IN THE

02:16:48.067 --> 02:16:51.503 region:rollup2
ONLY WAY WE EVER GOT COMPLIANCE

02:16:49.802 --> 02:16:53.872 region:rollup2
WAS TO PONY UP MONEY.

02:16:51.503 --> 02:16:55.240 region:rollup2
AND TO MAKE MONEY AVAILABLE IN

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:57.042 region:rollup2
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:59.144 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR IT FOR

02:16:57.042 --> 02:17:01.547 region:rollup2
THAT. PROPERTY OWNER SO.

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:03.982 region:rollup2
I'M VERY HESITANT TO START.

02:17:01.547 --> 02:17:05.851 region:rollup2
CREATING NEW OBLIGATIONS I

02:17:03.982 --> 02:17:08.053 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THE RISK AND

02:17:05.851 --> 02:17:09.988 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT IS IS IS IT'S A

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:11.457 region:rollup2
RISK ANALYSIS YOU HOPE NOTHING

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:12.791 region:rollup2
BAD HAPPENS IN.

02:17:11.457 --> 02:17:14.560 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON THAT AND

02:17:12.791 --> 02:17:16.462 region:rollup2
REINFORCED MASONRY BECAME UP

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:18.363 region:rollup2
PRIORITY IS BECAUSE SOMETHING

02:17:16.462 --> 02:17:19.765 region:rollup2
BAD DID HAPPEN THAT I LOOKED BY

02:17:18.363 --> 02:17:21.633 region:rollup2
I'M WITH YOU ON THE INVENTORY

02:17:19.765 --> 02:17:23.335 region:rollup2
THE REST OF IT HAS ME CONCERNED

02:17:21.633 --> 02:17:24.470 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE ON. ANYTHING THAT

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:25.938 region:rollup2
COST.

02:17:24.470 --> 02:17:27.239 region:rollup2
THAT STARTS TO COST MONEY

02:17:25.938 --> 02:17:29.174 region:rollup2
BECOMES A CONCERN WE'RE GONNA

02:17:27.239 --> 02:17:30.175 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PUT MONEY IN ORDER TO BE

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:32.111 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:33.512 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE SO I'M PREPARED TO

02:17:32.111 --> 02:17:34.813 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

02:17:33.512 --> 02:17:36.982 region:rollup2
I'M WILL RESERVE.

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:38.517 region:rollup2
KIND OF JUDGMENT AS YOU MOVE

02:17:36.982 --> 02:17:40.319 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE

02:17:38.517 --> 02:17:41.787 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

02:17:40.319 --> 02:17:44.089 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR US TO

02:17:41.787 --> 02:17:45.357 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT BUILDINGS ARE AT RISK

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:47.459 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR.

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:49.094 region:rollup2
MY MY CONCERN IS.

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:50.829 region:rollup2
ARE THESE.

02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:52.865 region:rollup2
OLDER.

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:54.766 region:rollup2
APARTMENT BUILDINGS

02:17:52.865 --> 02:17:56.335 region:rollup2
THAT WERE BUILT SO THAT YOU CAN

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:57.836 region:rollup2
PARK UNDERNEATH AND THEN YOU.

02:17:56.335 --> 02:18:00.072 region:rollup2
MAY LIVE ABOVE IT THAT THEY

02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:01.173 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THIS STRUCTURAL

02:18:00.072 --> 02:18:03.475 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY THAT YOU'D WANT HAVE

02:18:01.173 --> 02:18:04.810 region:rollup2
NOWADAYS. AND THOSE ARE SOME OF

02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:06.912 region:rollup2
OUR POOREST IN OUR POOREST

02:18:04.810 --> 02:18:07.513 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD SO TO HAVE THAT

02:18:06.912 --> 02:18:08.013 region:rollup2
INFORMATION I THINK WOULD BE

02:18:07.513 --> 02:18:09.515 region:rollup2
GOOD.

02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:10.916 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED TO

02:18:09.515 --> 02:18:11.984 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND

02:18:10.916 --> 02:18:14.153 region:rollup2
ANY RETROFITS.

02:18:11.984 --> 02:18:15.587 region:rollup2
AND HOW HOW CAN WE MAKE IT

02:18:14.153 --> 02:18:16.755 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SO THEN

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:17.823 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT PUSHING OUT ALL OF

02:18:16.755 --> 02:18:19.725 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THOSE

02:18:17.823 --> 02:18:21.026 region:rollup2
APARTMENTS. EITHER YOU GOT A RED

02:18:19.725 --> 02:18:22.794 region:rollup2
TAG THEM OR YOU GOTTA BRING THEM

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:24.730 region:rollup2
UP AND IF THE BRING HIM UP MEANS

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:26.498 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE IN

02:18:24.730 --> 02:18:28.534 region:rollup2
IN IN A MARKET RIGHT NOW THAT IS

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:30.435 region:rollup2
ALREADY AND AFFORDABLE. THEN

02:18:28.534 --> 02:18:30.969 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE SO I I

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:33.539 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:35.474 region:rollup2
I I LOOK AT THAT IN IN RURAL

02:18:33.539 --> 02:18:37.309 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITIES IT'S PROBABLY

02:18:35.474 --> 02:18:38.443 region:rollup2
LESS OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE

02:18:37.309 --> 02:18:40.078 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE AS MANY MORE TAKE

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:41.947 region:rollup2
STORY STRUCTURES. BUT.

02:18:40.078 --> 02:18:42.781 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:18:41.947 --> 02:18:43.816 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.449 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS AND I THINK YOU

02:18:43.816 --> 02:18:45.818 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:18:44.449 --> 02:18:46.919 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

02:18:45.818 --> 02:18:48.720 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I AM PURPOSE I'LL

02:18:46.919 --> 02:18:50.722 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF TODAY.

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.057 region:rollup2

SENTIMENT ALSO.

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:59.431 region:rollup2
S. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY.

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:01.800 region:rollup2
VERY SAME BILL I.

TODAY.

02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:07.706 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:09.274 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I STILL ON THE STATE'S

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:10.909 region:rollup2
SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION IS MY

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:12.244 region:rollup2
SECOND TENURE THERE I WAS FIRST

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:14.346 region:rollup2
APPOINTED MARSH WERE STATE WAS A

02:19:12.244 --> 02:19:15.514 region:rollup2
CITY OFFICIAL.

02:19:14.346 --> 02:19:17.349 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY FIRST TOUCHY ISSUE

02:19:15.514 --> 02:19:18.884 region:rollup2
OVER OF QUAKE IS A SENIOR AT CAL

02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:20.419 region:rollup2
WORK WITH A BAG DOING A BAY AREA

VULNERABILITY IN THE YEARS AFTER

02:19:22.354 --> 02:19:25.490 region:rollup2

02:19:23.889 --> 02:19:27.092 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE.

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:28.760 region:rollup2

AT OUR RESPONSE TO LOMA PRIETA.

02:19:31.863 --> 02:19:35.534 region:rollup2
ARM.

02:19:34.166 --> 02:19:37.536 region:rollup2

THEY KNOW WHEN THE WHEN.

02:20:28.053 --> 02:20:30.856 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDATION TO BE BOLTED TO

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:32.057 region:rollup2

02:20:32.057 --> 02:20:34.793 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:36.328 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

POSITION OF THE REALTORS.

02:20:36.328 --> 02:20:40.132 region:rollup2

02:20:44.836 --> 02:20:48.240 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. OF

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:49.975 region:rollup2
REALTORS.

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:50.676 region:rollup2
TO KNOWING FACTS ABOUT A HOUSE

02:20:49.975 --> 02:20:51.977 region:rollup2

02:20:50.676 --> 02:20:53.378 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THAT WAS A LAND

02:20:51.977 --> 02:20:55.781 region:rollup2

02:20:57.349 --> 02:21:00.419 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ADDED AS A CONSEQUENCE

02:20:58.784 --> 02:21:00.952 region:rollup2
THE EASTERN DECISION. TO SORT OF

02:21:00.419 --> 02:21:03.155 region:rollup2

02:21:00.952 --> 02:21:04.456 region:rollup2
WE JUST.

02:21:03.155 --> 02:21:06.224 region:rollup2
ADDRESS OUR LIABILITY BY

02:21:04.456 --> 02:21:08.060 region:rollup2
INFORMING YOU OF WHAT THE FACTS

02:21:06.224 --> 02:21:09.394 region:rollup2
ARE CONSTRUED PROPERTY.

02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:10.362 region:rollup2
REALTORS DON'T HAVE TO THORNY

02:21:09.394 --> 02:21:11.730 region:rollup2
SWITCHES ARE DOING WORK THAT YOU

02:21:10.362 --> 02:21:12.931 region:rollup2
JUST PROVIDED DISCLOSURE

02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:14.466 region:rollup2
STATEMENT.

02:21:12.931 --> 02:21:16.501 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED

02:21:14.466 --> 02:21:19.171 region:rollup2
ADD THE ALL ALQUIST PRIOLO

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:21.073 region:rollup2
SIZING. ZONES DISCLOSURE WHICH

02:21:19.171 --> 02:21:22.140 region:rollup2
IS ALSO PART OF THAT.

02:21:21.073 --> 02:21:23.408 region:rollup2
SO THE GENERAL ISSUES OF

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.242 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:21:23.408 --> 02:21:25.344 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU DON'T OVER THE YEARS

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:27.112 region:rollup2
TO COME TO EASE THE BURDEN ON

02:21:25.344 --> 02:21:28.513 region:rollup2
REALTORS.

02:21:27.112 --> 02:21:30.315 region:rollup2
THEY ALL STEM FROM THE EAST

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:31.183 region:rollup2
EASTON DECISION THERE SO MUCH

02:21:30.315 --> 02:21:33.251 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OUT THERE FOR

02:21:31.183 --> 02:21:34.853 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS BUT PEOPLE DO

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:36.822 region:rollup2
NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHAT.

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:37.789 region:rollup2
THE RISKS ARE.

02:21:36.822 --> 02:21:41.126 region:rollup2
SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THIS

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:44.062 region:rollup2
INVENTORY IS A GOOD IDEA.

02:21:41.126 --> 02:21:44.996 region:rollup2
I THINK THE NOTION OF EVALUATION

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:46.264 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

02:21:44.996 --> 02:21:47.165 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AROUND HOW YOU DO

02:21:46.264 --> 02:21:49.167 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN AWFUL

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:50.502 region:rollup2
LOT OF GUIDES.

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:51.570 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR

02:21:50.502 --> 02:21:53.405 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL PROBABLY ONE OF THE

02:21:51.570 --> 02:21:54.673 region:rollup2
FIXES IT YOU NEED.

02:21:53.405 --> 02:21:56.208 region:rollup2
THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WAYS TO

02:21:54.673 --> 02:21:57.242 region:rollup2
MASSAGE THAT. SO THEN YOU GET

02:21:56.208 --> 02:21:58.877 region:rollup2
DOWN TO HOW YOU HANDLE THE

02:21:57.242 --> 02:22:00.545 region:rollup2
MITIGATION.

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:01.146 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS A VITAL ISSUE

02:22:00.545 --> 02:22:03.215 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S SORT OF ON THE BACK

02:22:01.146 --> 02:22:04.683 region:rollup2
INTO THIS.

02:22:03.215 --> 02:22:06.151 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BECOMES VERY

02:22:04.683 --> 02:22:06.885 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO TO ALLOW US TO

THAT'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:42.300 region:rollup2
CONCERN WITH CHANGING THE

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:03.487 region:rollup2
WE THINK THERE'S A PUBLIC POLICY

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:05.056 region:rollup2

02:36:05.923 --> 02:36:09.994 region:rollup2
PREEXISTING. LEGAL NONCONFORMING

02:36:08.392 --> 02:36:13.297 region:rollup2

TO AND MORE RESIDENTIAL USES AND

INTENSIFY THE RESIDENTIAL USE.

02:36:14.398 --> 02:36:17.034 region:rollup2
AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:18.736 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS WITH SURROUNDING

02:36:17.034 --> 02:36:21.005 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL OR

02:36:18.736 --> 02:36:22.039 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND WE THINK

02:36:21.005 --> 02:36:23.574 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL PRECLUDES

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:24.909 region:rollup2
LEGITIMATE RESTRICTIONS ON

02:36:23.574 --> 02:36:26.043 region:rollup2
PARCEL SIZES IN THE

UNINCORPORATED AREA.

02:36:26.043 --> 02:36:29.780 region:rollup2
AS EVERYONE HERE PROBABLY KNOWS

02:36:28.446 --> 02:36:32.083 region:rollup2
A LOT OF UNINCORPORATED AREAS

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:34.085 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY WATER OR

02:36:32.083 --> 02:36:35.987 region:rollup2
SEWER SO. PARCEL SIZE IS AN

02:36:34.085 --> 02:36:37.788 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT SCREENING CRITERIA TO

02:36:35.987 --> 02:36:39.757 region:rollup2
DETERMINE IF THERE'S LIKELY TO

02:36:37.788 --> 02:36:41.092 region:rollup2
BE ROOM FOR THE SEPTIC AND WELL

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:43.394 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY

02:36:41.092 --> 02:36:45.296 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR ADDING. AS LOTS

02:36:43.394 --> 02:36:47.531 region:rollup2
OF RURAL COUNTIES ALLOW VERY

02:36:45.296 --> 02:36:48.466 region:rollup2
LARGE ACCEPTS REDRAWING UNITS

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:50.067 region:rollup2
PLASTER COUNTY'S ORDINANCE

02:36:48.466 --> 02:36:52.203 region:rollup2

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:53.738 region:rollup2

ACCESSORY. RESIDENTIAL USES THAT

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:59.744 region:rollup2
CAN BE ADDED TO THE PROPERTY SO

02:36:58.042 --> 02:37:01.012 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESSENTIALLY

02:36:59.744 --> 02:37:02.346 region:rollup2
ADDING A SECOND HOME IN THAT

02:37:01.012 --> 02:37:04.482 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:06.817 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS

02:37:04.482 --> 02:37:08.252 region:rollup2
BILLS INCLUSION OF LANGUAGE

02:37:06.817 --> 02:37:09.520 region:rollup2
THAT'S POPPED UP IN OTHER PLACES

02:37:08.252 --> 02:37:10.221 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:37:15.293 --> 02:37:19.397 region:rollup2
THROUGH A FORMAL RULE MAKING

02:37:16.527 --> 02:37:20.164 region:rollup2
PROCESS I'M IS INAPPROPRIATE AND

02:37:19.397 --> 02:37:21.666 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:23.000 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

02:37:21.666 --> 02:37:25.269 region:rollup2
STANDARD WE THINK IT'LL BE VERY

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.038 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT. FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO

02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:28.406 region:rollup2
MAKE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS

02:37:27.038 --> 02:37:29.907 region:rollup2
SUCH AS RESTRICTING ACCEPTS

02:37:28.406 --> 02:37:31.609 region:rollup2

02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:41.018 region:rollup2
THAT STANDARD I'M FINALLY WE ARE

02:37:39.417 --> 02:37:42.253 region:rollup2
LITTLE BITCONFUSED WITH THE

02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:49.894 region:rollup2

AND THE FACT THAT MATTER IS

02:40:09.633 --> 02:40:13.104 region:rollup2
ANOTHER FORTY THREE HUNDRED

02:40:11.202 --> 02:40:15.406 region:rollup2
UNITS THAT ARE EITHER BUILT IN

02:40:13.104 --> 02:40:17.241 region:rollup2

02:40:15.406 --> 02:40:19.009 region:rollup2
PROCESS. AT A ACROSS THE STATE

02:40:17.241 --> 02:40:21.245 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:22.513 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AT A HOUSING BOOM WHEN

02:40:21.245 --> 02:40:25.115 region:rollup2
YOU COMPARE THAT.

02:40:22.513 --> 02:40:26.650 region:rollup2
TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOUSING

02:40:25.115 --> 02:40:28.319 region:rollup2
UNITS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED AN

02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:29.186 region:rollup2
AVERAGE YEARS BEFORE WHICH IS

02:40:28.319 --> 02:40:30.955 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE.

02:40:29.186 --> 02:40:32.056 region:rollup2

02:40:30.955 --> 02:40:34.358 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND OR

02:40:32.056 --> 02:40:36.427 region:rollup2
SO STATEWIDE WHICH IS A.

02:40:34.358 --> 02:40:38.329 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE NUMBER WE NEED FAR

02:40:36.427 --> 02:40:40.564 region:rollup2
MORE HOUSING BUT FORTY THREE

02:40:38.329 --> 02:40:42.833 region:rollup2
HUNDRED UNITS AIN'T BAD WHEN.

02:40:40.564 --> 02:40:44.335 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CONSIDERING ITS

02:40:42.833 --> 02:40:45.903 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL UNITS.

02:40:44.335 --> 02:40:47.738 region:rollup2

THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE AND

02:40:53.344 --> 02:40:57.882 region:rollup2
I THINK A SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL

02:40:54.879 --> 02:41:00.518 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO

02:40:57.882 --> 02:41:02.319 region:rollup2
UTILIZE A EIGHTY USED IN THE

PROVIDE TO A BADLY NEEDED

02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:09.326 region:rollup2
HOUSING BECAUSE THESE UNITS CAN

02:41:07.191 --> 02:41:11.095 region:rollup2
BE BUILT FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN

02:41:09.326 --> 02:41:12.530 region:rollup2

AS SORT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE

AGE.

02:43:46.917 --> 02:43:51.822 region:rollup2
AGING PROCESS.

02:43:49.453 --> 02:43:54.191 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT I HAVE LOCAL

02:43:51.822 --> 02:43:55.492 region:rollup2
CHAMBERS THAT A A BIG ISSUE ON

02:43:54.191 --> 02:43:56.460 region:rollup2
THEIR RADAR SCREEN IS THE LOSS

02:43:55.492 --> 02:43:58.395 region:rollup2
OF.

02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:00.397 region:rollup2
.

02:43:58.395 --> 02:44:01.765 region:rollup2
RETAIL AND PEOPLE OUT IN THE

02:44:00.397 --> 02:44:04.201 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SPENDING MONEY AT

AGING COMMUNITY.

02:44:07.638 --> 02:44:12.242 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS TYPE OF.

02:44:09.606 --> 02:44:13.644 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT ACTUALLY.

02:44:12.242 --> 02:44:15.546 region:rollup2
IT IS GOOD TO GET PEOPLE IN A

02:44:13.644 --> 02:44:18.449 region:rollup2
ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.

02:44:15.546 --> 02:44:20.084 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT CONSERVE SUPPORT.

02:44:18.449 --> 02:44:21.485 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DENSITIES AND.

02:44:20.084 --> 02:44:23.320 region:rollup2
IN A COMPATIBLE WAY WITHIN THE

02:44:21.485 --> 02:44:25.022 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND THAT RELEASES A

02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:26.156 region:rollup2
LOT OF POSITIVE ENERGY.

02:44:25.022 --> 02:44:28.525 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORTS OPENLY PROPERTY

02:44:26.156 --> 02:44:30.494 region:rollup2

02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:46.443 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S DEFINITE ECONOMIC

02:44:44.775 --> 02:44:47.911 region:rollup2

THAT ARE OCCURRING IN A DAILY

02:54:29.793 --> 02:54:34.397 region:rollup2
BASIS ON OUR ECONOMY. AS BRICK

02:54:32.128 --> 02:54:37.100 region:rollup2

IN OUR ECONOMY.

02:54:43.273 --> 02:54:46.276 region:rollup2

BEING GAINED.

02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:54.417 region:rollup2
A ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I

CONTROL BOARD HAS BEEN

02:58:35.605 --> 02:58:38.841 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED MORE THAN THREE

02:58:37.073 --> 02:58:40.043 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WATER SYSTEM STATEWIDE

02:58:38.841 --> 02:58:41.544 region:rollup2

02:58:46.216 --> 02:58:49.619 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OR LACK LOCAL

FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND

02:58:49.619 --> 02:58:53.256 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL RESOURCES BUT A VAST

02:58:51.621 --> 02:58:54.824 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE

02:58:53.256 --> 02:58:56.226 region:rollup2
SMALL RURAL SYSTEMS THAT

02:58:54.824 --> 02:58:58.261 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY SERVE LESS THAN TEN

02:58:56.226 --> 02:59:00.129 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO BASICALLY

02:58:58.261 --> 02:59:03.132 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WOULD DO IS SET UP AS I

02:59:00.129 --> 02:59:05.735 region:rollup2
AM INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO.

02:59:03.132 --> 02:59:07.637 region:rollup2
HELP THESE WATER SYSTEMS TO

CONSOLIDATE EVEN THOUGH

02:59:07.637 --> 02:59:11.140 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICALLY THEY MAY BE.

02:59:09.339 --> 02:59:13.376 region:rollup2

02:59:13.376 --> 02:59:17.246 region:rollup2
IT IS A.

02:59:14.811 --> 02:59:18.414 region:rollup2
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US

02:59:17.246 --> 02:59:19.716 region:rollup2
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WOULD

02:59:18.414 --> 02:59:21.751 region:rollup2
WORK AS THE STATE BOARD WOULD

02:59:19.716 --> 02:59:23.486 region:rollup2
NOTIFY THE CHRONICALLY

02:59:21.751 --> 02:59:25.355 region:rollup2
NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS.

02:59:23.486 --> 02:59:25.922 region:rollup2
AND THEY WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH

02:59:25.355 --> 02:59:27.223 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A

02:59:25.922 --> 02:59:29.092 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:59:27.223 --> 02:59:30.693 region:rollup2
IF A PLAN IS AN APPROVED THEN

02:59:29.092 --> 02:59:32.862 region:rollup2
THE STATE BOARD WOULD NOTIFY.

02:59:30.693 --> 02:59:34.364 region:rollup2
LITTLE HALF GOES AND THE LAUGH

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:36.666 region:rollup2
GOES WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP TO

02:59:34.364 --> 02:59:38.101 region:rollup2

HAS TO BE DONE AND I'M GONNA TRY

03:00:06.996 --> 03:00:10.133 region:rollup2
AND BE BRIEF.

03:00:07.764 --> 03:00:11.868 region:rollup2

03:00:13.036 --> 03:00:16.306 region:rollup2
THEY ARE IN THAT IS THEIR

03:00:14.971 --> 03:00:18.308 region:rollup2
MISSION THEIR MISSIONS PROVIDE

03:00:16.306 --> 03:00:20.043 region:rollup2
CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THAT'S

03:00:18.308 --> 03:00:22.011 region:rollup2
A MISSION THAT SHOULD BE SHARED.

03:00:20.043 --> 03:00:23.513 region:rollup2
BY THE THE LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS

03:00:22.011 --> 03:00:24.881 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FAILING TO DO THAT THE

03:00:23.513 --> 03:00:25.915 region:rollup2
SMALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS

03:00:24.881 --> 03:00:27.250 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE FAILED TO DO THAT WITH

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:28.885 region:rollup2
THEIR PRIVATE SYSTEMS. OR PUBLIC

03:00:28.885 --> 03:00:32.355 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT'S AN

03:00:31.387 --> 03:00:33.823 region:rollup2

03:00:37.927 --> 03:00:41.597 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS SOME OF THE TOOLS

03:00:39.896 --> 03:00:42.832 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FULLY

03:07:58.968 --> 03:08:02.705 region:rollup2

AND SO WE'VE OFFERED SOME OF

03:08:08.177 --> 03:08:11.781 region:rollup2
SUMMER GENERIC KIND OF LANGUAGE

03:08:09.979 --> 03:08:13.449 region:rollup2

AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED.

03:08:16.986 --> 03:08:21.023 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY NEW PROCESS

03:08:19.188 --> 03:08:23.025 region:rollup2
UNCHARTED TERRITORY WE DO NOT

03:08:21.023 --> 03:08:25.361 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST.

03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:27.029 region:rollup2
WE COULD GIVE SOME ESTIMATES

03:08:25.361 --> 03:08:29.064 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

03:08:27.029 --> 03:08:30.232 region:rollup2
TO HAVEN'T NOT TO EXCEED DOLLAR

03:08:29.064 --> 03:08:31.667 region:rollup2
AMOUNT SO.

03:08:30.232 --> 03:08:32.201 region:rollup2

MAINLY IN RURAL AREAS MAINLY

03:08:56.992 --> 03:09:00.129 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE SMALL DISTRICTS

03:08:58.561 --> 03:09:01.463 region:rollup2

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:04.800 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A

03:09:03.199 --> 03:09:07.269 region:rollup2
SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.971 region:rollup2
SOLVED. AND BY AND LARGE THIS IS

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:12.007 region:rollup2

FIX THE STAND BY CHARGES.

03:09:16.545 --> 03:09:20.182 region:rollup2

03:10:18.641 --> 03:10:22.912 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUE.

A COMMENT ABOUT THIS BILL I.

03:10:36.325 --> 03:10:41.330 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY SEE THE VALUE OF IT.

03:10:39.128 --> 03:10:41.897 region:rollup2
BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL I HAVE

03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:43.565 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WELL IT'S

03:10:41.897 --> 03:10:45.501 region:rollup2
DRAFTED.

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:47.269 region:rollup2

PAGES OF NEW AD MATERIAL THAT

03:10:49.438 --> 03:10:52.708 region:rollup2
I'VE KIND OF GONE THROUGH. THE

03:10:50.940 --> 03:10:54.843 region:rollup2
THING I CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IS IN

03:10:52.708 --> 03:10:56.245 region:rollup2
THE FINANCING PROVISIONS.

03:10:54.843 --> 03:10:57.846 region:rollup2
I'M READING THOSE PROVISIONS

03:10:56.245 --> 03:11:00.182 region:rollup2

03:11:00.716 --> 03:11:05.154 region:rollup2
MODEL.

03:11:03.118 --> 03:11:06.188 region:rollup2
VERY CONFUSING TO READ.

03:11:05.154 --> 03:11:08.023 region:rollup2
WE ARE TALKING APPROVING

03:11:06.188 --> 03:11:09.892 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS OF COURSE UNDER THE.

03:11:08.023 --> 03:11:10.960 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CODE IMPROVEMENT

03:11:09.892 --> 03:11:12.661 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS START WITH THE TWO

03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:14.596 region:rollup2
THIRDS.

03:11:12.661 --> 03:11:16.732 region:rollup2
SIGNING ON A PROPERTY OWNER SO

03:11:14.596 --> 03:11:17.333 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOOD.

03:11:16.732 --> 03:11:18.934 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE

03:11:17.333 --> 03:11:20.936 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROVISIONS.

03:11:18.934 --> 03:11:23.339 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL.

03:11:20.936 --> 03:11:25.574 region:rollup2
THE THE REVENUE BOND WE WE

03:11:23.339 --> 03:11:28.043 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THE BONDS FROM ANY

03:11:25.574 --> 03:11:30.379 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROVISION.

03:11:28.043 --> 03:11:31.513 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTION OF.

03:11:30.379 --> 03:11:33.482 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM IS

03:11:31.513 --> 03:11:34.850 region:rollup2
REFERENDUM ALL.

03:11:33.482 --> 03:11:37.119 region:rollup2
SO OKAY YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM THE

03:11:34.850 --> 03:11:38.420 region:rollup2
ELECTION PROVISIONS BUT IT'S

03:11:37.119 --> 03:11:39.188 region:rollup2
REFERENDA BOWL WHO'S GOING TO BE

03:11:38.420 --> 03:11:40.989 region:rollup2
DOING THE VOTING.

03:11:39.188 --> 03:11:42.191 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT.

03:11:40.989 --> 03:11:44.026 region:rollup2
I CAN'T SPEND THE MONEY ACCEPT

03:11:42.191 --> 03:11:45.227 region:rollup2
ANY IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS.

03:11:44.026 --> 03:11:48.230 region:rollup2
BUT ALL THE SERVICE AREA

03:11:45.227 --> 03:11:50.599 region:rollup2
INCLUDES ADJACENT AREAS.

03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:52.868 region:rollup2
ADJACENT AREAS THAT ARE THERE AS

03:11:50.599 --> 03:11:55.237 region:rollup2
OF THE DATE OF THE ELECTION.

03:11:52.868 --> 03:11:57.239 region:rollup2
DOES NOT APPLY.

03:11:55.237 --> 03:11:59.908 region:rollup2
SO I JUST FEEL THERE NEEDS TO BE

03:11:57.239 --> 03:12:00.476 region:rollup2
SOME CARE LOOKING AT THOSE

03:11:59.908 --> 03:12:00.976 region:rollup2
PROTECTING PROVISIONS OF THE

03:12:00.476 --> 03:12:02.711 region:rollup2

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:07.383 region:rollup2
AND.

03:12:05.647 --> 03:12:09.184 region:rollup2
SO I AM ACTUALLY TALKING TO

03:12:07.383 --> 03:12:11.320 region:rollup2
SEVENTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED

PREDICTABLE IT IS MUCH MORE

03:17:55.997 --> 03:17:59.634 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

THERE'S AN INCREASE IN THE COST

03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:51.266 region:rollup2

BASED ON A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS

03:24:07.202 --> 03:24:10.371 region:rollup2
I'M BUT THE ONE THING I THINK TO

03:24:08.603 --> 03:24:12.540 region:rollup2
MAKE VERY VERY CLEAR IS THAT.

03:24:10.371 --> 03:24:14.109 region:rollup2
THESE FEES ARE LAWFUL AND THESE

03:24:12.540 --> 03:24:15.877 region:rollup2

SERVICES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO

03:24:20.482 --> 03:24:23.718 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF

03:24:22.417 --> 03:24:24.586 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT TO PAY FOR THE

03:24:23.718 --> 03:24:25.887 region:rollup2
PARKS THE LIBRARIES THE POLICE

03:24:24.586 --> 03:24:27.322 region:rollup2
SERVICE. EVERYTHING THAT'S

03:24:25.887 --> 03:24:28.523 region:rollup2
NEEDED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS

03:24:27.322 --> 03:24:30.658 region:rollup2
TO COME OUT OF THESE.

FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

03:24:30.658 --> 03:24:34.028 region:rollup2
AND MOST NOTABLY PROP THIRTEEN

03:24:32.293 --> 03:24:35.764 region:rollup2
AND WE CANNOT SPREAD THE COST OF

03:24:34.028 --> 03:24:36.631 region:rollup2
OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON TO PEOPLE

03:24:35.764 --> 03:24:38.800 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BENEFIT

03:24:36.631 --> 03:24:39.868 region:rollup2
FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT SO. THAT'S

03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:42.036 region:rollup2
WHY THAT THE FEES ARE WHAT THEY

03:24:39.868 --> 03:24:43.338 region:rollup2
ARE I'M IN IT IT IS A IT IS A

03:24:42.036 --> 03:24:44.105 region:rollup2
REAL STRUGGLE SO I I CERTAINLY

03:24:43.338 --> 03:24:45.740 region:rollup2
SYMPATHIZE WITH WITH THE

03:24:44.105 --> 03:24:47.275 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS. ONE THING TO MAKE

03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:48.443 region:rollup2
CLEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT HERE TO

03:24:47.275 --> 03:24:49.744 region:rollup2
PLAY A GAME OF GOTCHA WITH THE

03:24:48.443 --> 03:24:51.079 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS AND WE CERTAINLY WANT

03:24:49.744 --> 03:24:52.580 region:rollup2
TO TELL THEM WHAT THE FEES ARE.

03:24:51.079 --> 03:24:53.481 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE FEES WE DO NOT

03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:54.983 region:rollup2
KNOW AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF

03:24:53.481 --> 03:24:57.018 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS SO MAKES IT

03:24:54.983 --> 03:24:57.852 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT THEN TO A DETERMINE

03:24:57.018 --> 03:24:59.554 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE FEES ARE ACTUALLY

03:24:57.852 --> 03:25:00.989 region:rollup2
GONNA BE. SO I MEAN IF IT'S

03:24:59.554 --> 03:25:02.323 region:rollup2
ABOUT TELLING DEVELOPER EXACTLY

03:25:00.989 --> 03:25:03.858 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO

03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:05.460 region:rollup2
ADD IN A DEVELOPING GREAT WE

03:25:03.858 --> 03:25:07.028 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT. I'M BUT

03:25:05.460 --> 03:25:08.029 region:rollup2
TO FREEZE THESE FEES AND OUR

03:25:07.028 --> 03:25:08.496 region:rollup2
MINDS AT LEAST ESSENTIALLY

03:25:08.029 --> 03:25:14.068 region:rollup2
REWARDS ARE DEVELOPERS

03:25:08.496 --> 03:25:15.136 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING APPROVED PROJECTS WE

03:25:14.068 --> 03:25:17.806 region:rollup2
DON'T BUILD THE HOMES THE

03:25:15.136 --> 03:25:18.773 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS BUILD HOMES SO IF

03:25:17.806 --> 03:25:20.542 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO TO

03:25:18.773 --> 03:25:22.477 region:rollup2
NOT DEVELOP FOR YEARS IN FREEZE

03:25:20.542 --> 03:25:22.944 region:rollup2
THOSE FEES. WHILE THE COST OF

03:25:22.477 --> 03:25:24.512 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THAT INS AND

03:25:22.944 --> 03:25:26.347 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUES TO

03:25:24.512 --> 03:25:29.984 region:rollup2
ESCALATE SEEM COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

03:25:26.347 --> 03:25:30.585 region:rollup2
IN FOR THAT WE HAVE TO POST.

03:25:29.984 --> 03:25:32.620 region:rollup2
CITY JOYS OF SENDING AMERICAN

03:25:30.585 --> 03:25:33.421 region:rollup2
PLANNING ASSOCIATION I'M AND WE

03:25:32.620 --> 03:25:34.856 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AUTHORS

03:25:33.421 --> 03:25:36.858 region:rollup2
OFFICE IN THE SPONSORS AND WE

03:25:34.856 --> 03:25:37.525 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT. I WON IT THERE

03:25:36.858 --> 03:25:39.093 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE AMENDMENT SO

03:25:37.525 --> 03:25:40.295 region:rollup2
WERE AT A DISADVANTAGE HERE AND

03:25:39.093 --> 03:25:42.964 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR

03:25:40.295 --> 03:25:43.965 region:rollup2
CONCERN. BUT THERE'S TWO ISSUES

03:25:42.964 --> 03:25:46.134 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY WERE BROUGHT UP

03:25:43.965 --> 03:25:48.269 region:rollup2
AND ONE IS THAT THE FEES WOULD

03:25:46.134 --> 03:25:51.439 region:rollup2
BE LOCKED IN. AYE OUT

03:25:48.269 --> 03:25:52.207 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETENESS.

03:25:51.439 --> 03:25:53.341 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BRAND NEW TERM WOULD

03:25:52.207 --> 03:25:55.410 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE

03:25:53.341 --> 03:25:57.278 region:rollup2
PART OF THE DISCUSSION IT'S

03:25:55.410 --> 03:25:58.413 region:rollup2
EITHER COMPLETE OR IT'S NOT WE

03:25:57.278 --> 03:25:59.881 region:rollup2
WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE ABLE TO

03:25:58.413 --> 03:26:01.549 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT

03:25:59.881 --> 03:26:03.117 region:rollup2
FEES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE

03:26:01.549 --> 03:26:04.819 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE HAVE MADE THAT

03:26:03.117 --> 03:26:06.721 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION THAT'S. COMPLETE.

03:26:04.819 --> 03:26:08.289 region:rollup2
THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR US

03:26:06.721 --> 03:26:11.226 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T NOT WANT NEW

03:26:08.289 --> 03:26:13.761 region:rollup2
TERMS AND REQUIREMENTS IN THE

03:26:11.226 --> 03:26:13.761 region:rollup2
MIDDLE OF A PROCESS HAS BEEN.

03:26:13.828 --> 03:26:18.333 region:rollup2
THE SECOND IS THAT.

03:26:15.463 --> 03:26:20.368 region:rollup2
I THINK AS AS A LEAGUE NOTED.

03:26:18.333 --> 03:26:21.970 region:rollup2
WE WON'T KNOW THE EXACT.

03:26:20.368 --> 03:26:23.571 region:rollup2

THE COMPLETE APPLICATION.

03:26:36.117 --> 03:26:39.821 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO STE DO A SCHEDULE

OF FEES WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

03:26:39.821 --> 03:26:43.491 region:rollup2

03:28:50.385 --> 03:28:53.888 region:rollup2
THAT THE CASE.

03:28:52.987 --> 03:28:55.723 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE PERMIT STREAMLINED

03:28:53.888 --> 03:28:56.591 region:rollup2
ACT APPLIES AND THEN YOU HAVE

03:28:55.723 --> 03:28:58.025 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW VESTED TENET AMOUNTS

03:28:56.591 --> 03:29:00.328 region:rollup2
INTO MEMPHIS ALL SORTS OF

03:28:58.025 --> 03:29:02.897 region:rollup2
TIMELINES AND. AND YOU KNOW YOU.

03:29:00.328 --> 03:29:05.366 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THAT THAT TIME.

03:29:02.897 --> 03:29:07.168 region:rollup2
TABLE IS THERE SO I UNDERSTAND

03:29:05.366 --> 03:29:08.202 region:rollup2
THE CITIES HAVE TO CONFORM TO

03:29:07.168 --> 03:29:09.203 region:rollup2
THAT TIME TABLE.

03:29:08.202 --> 03:29:10.171 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHERE THE STRUGGLE

03:29:09.203 --> 03:29:12.940 region:rollup2
HAPPENS

03:29:10.171 --> 03:29:14.509 region:rollup2
IS WHEN A DEVELOPER COMES THEY

03:29:12.940 --> 03:29:15.810 region:rollup2
MEET THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.

03:29:14.509 --> 03:29:17.145 region:rollup2
THEN ONCE THEY PASSED THAT

03:29:15.810 --> 03:29:17.779 region:rollup2
DESIGN REVIEW BOARD BECAUSE

03:29:17.145 --> 03:29:18.813 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING PUSHED BY THE TIME

03:29:17.779 --> 03:29:20.081 region:rollup2
LIMIT.

03:29:18.813 --> 03:29:21.616 region:rollup2
THEN THEY GET INTO THE PLANNING

03:29:20.081 --> 03:29:22.183 region:rollup2
COMMISSION STAGE ONCE WE GET

03:29:21.616 --> 03:29:23.284 region:rollup2
INTO THE PLANNING COMMISSION

03:29:22.183 --> 03:29:25.420 region:rollup2
STAGE.

03:29:23.284 --> 03:29:27.155 region:rollup2
PLANNING COMMISSIONERS OF OR

03:29:25.420 --> 03:29:29.123 region:rollup2
STAFF RECOMMENDING TO PLANNING

03:29:27.155 --> 03:29:30.625 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS MAY END UP SENDING

03:29:29.123 --> 03:29:33.528 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT.

03:29:30.625 --> 03:29:34.595 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE DESIGN REVIEW WELL

03:29:33.528 --> 03:29:36.631 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO GET THE PLANNING

03:29:34.595 --> 03:29:38.299 region:rollup2
STAGE IN HAVING GONE THAT FAR

03:29:36.631 --> 03:29:38.866 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A PERFORMER

03:29:38.299 --> 03:29:40.601 region:rollup2
THAT IS DONE.

03:29:38.866 --> 03:29:42.470 region:rollup2
PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:44.205 region:rollup2
PRICED OUT BY THE TIME WE GET

03:29:42.470 --> 03:29:46.274 region:rollup2
SENT BACK TO DESIGN REVIEW TO

03:29:44.205 --> 03:29:47.809 region:rollup2
MAKE CHANGES THE DESIGN REVIEW

03:29:46.274 --> 03:29:49.143 region:rollup2
OR TAKES THE LIBERTY AT THAT

03:29:47.809 --> 03:29:51.312 region:rollup2
POINT TO GO EVEN FURTHER.

03:29:49.143 --> 03:29:53.548 region:rollup2
OR TAKE AWAY TO THE POINT THAT

03:29:51.312 --> 03:29:55.616 region:rollup2
IT DOES IMPACT THE COST OF A JOB

03:29:53.548 --> 03:29:57.085 region:rollup2
OR A PROJECT I I'VE RARELY EVER

03:29:55.616 --> 03:29:58.019 region:rollup2
SEEN IT GO DOWN.

03:29:57.085 --> 03:29:59.954 region:rollup2
EVER.

03:29:58.019 --> 03:30:01.722 region:rollup2
IS IN MY IN MY KNOWLEDGE.

03:29:59.954 --> 03:30:03.658 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE SEEN IT MULTIPLE

03:30:01.722 --> 03:30:05.293 region:rollup2
TIMES INCREASE.

03:30:03.658 --> 03:30:06.494 region:rollup2
I EVEN TO THE POINT AND I WILL

03:30:05.293 --> 03:30:08.663 region:rollup2
TELL YOU THIS AS A.

03:30:06.494 --> 03:30:09.163 region:rollup2
AS A MEMBER ON THE COUNCIL

03:30:08.663 --> 03:30:11.532 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:30:09.163 --> 03:30:11.999 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE

03:30:11.532 --> 03:30:14.001 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT I FACED A

03:30:11.999 --> 03:30:16.771 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:17.371 region:rollup2
WAS.

03:30:16.771 --> 03:30:17.905 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH AND I THOUGHT I

03:30:17.371 --> 03:30:18.639 region:rollup2
FELT LIKE WE HAD A PRETTY

03:30:17.905 --> 03:30:19.941 region:rollup2
DECENT.

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:21.342 region:rollup2
PROCESS

03:30:19.941 --> 03:30:22.877 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN THEN IT WAS GOING

03:30:21.342 --> 03:30:24.479 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT PLANNING PROCESS

03:30:22.877 --> 03:30:26.314 region:rollup2
AND HITTING THOSE BOMBS AND THEN

03:30:24.479 --> 03:30:26.948 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COST COMING AFTER A

03:30:26.314 --> 03:30:28.816 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE

03:30:26.948 --> 03:30:31.319 region:rollup2
APPLICATION.

03:30:28.816 --> 03:30:32.954 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

03:30:31.319 --> 03:30:35.723 region:rollup2
THE ATTEMPT THAT THIS BILL IS

03:30:32.954 --> 03:30:36.791 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE ALONG WITH YOUR.

03:30:35.723 --> 03:30:38.426 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR WORK ABILITY WITH

03:30:36.791 --> 03:30:40.361 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION

03:30:38.426 --> 03:30:41.729 region:rollup2
TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF

03:30:40.361 --> 03:30:42.830 region:rollup2
A A COMPROMISE AND I BELIEVE

03:30:41.729 --> 03:30:44.866 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS I

03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:47.835 region:rollup2
KNOW THEY'RE BRAND NEW. SO SOME

03:30:44.866 --> 03:30:49.637 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT.

03:30:47.835 --> 03:30:51.272 region:rollup2
SO IF I COULD IF I COULD DAM.

03:30:49.637 --> 03:30:51.672 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO THAT PART OF THE

03:30:51.272 --> 03:30:53.608 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WAS THE.

03:30:51.672 --> 03:30:55.376 region:rollup2
.

03:30:53.608 --> 03:30:57.845 region:rollup2
THE EXPEDITED.

03:30:55.376 --> 03:30:58.679 region:rollup2
DOUBLE REFERRAL SYSTEM PRODUCT

03:30:57.845 --> 03:31:00.848 region:rollup2
UP FRANKLY.

03:30:58.679 --> 03:31:03.251 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE

03:31:00.848 --> 03:31:05.987 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

03:31:03.251 --> 03:31:07.555 region:rollup2
REQUESTED. BOTH BY THE APA AND

03:31:05.987 --> 03:31:09.624 region:rollup2
BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SO

03:31:07.555 --> 03:31:11.092 region:rollup2
MY MY APOLOGIES IT IN IN TERMS

03:31:09.624 --> 03:31:13.361 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROCESS BUT. WHAT'S

03:31:11.092 --> 03:31:15.062 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IS THAT.

03:31:13.361 --> 03:31:16.664 region:rollup2
IS THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THESE

03:31:15.062 --> 03:31:18.332 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ARE THINGS THAT THEY

03:31:16.664 --> 03:31:21.035 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THAT WE WORK ON THAT

03:31:18.332 --> 03:31:22.370 region:rollup2
WORK THE JOB ISN'T DONE YET. WE

03:31:21.035 --> 03:31:22.870 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT

03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:25.406 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:27.475 region:rollup2
THERE'S WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

03:31:25.406 --> 03:31:29.410 region:rollup2
QUIBBLE WITH THE MITIGATION ACT

03:31:27.475 --> 03:31:30.344 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT OPERATES THAT'S NOT

03:31:29.410 --> 03:31:32.880 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO.

03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:34.081 region:rollup2
AMELIORATE AGAINST WHAT WE'RE

03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:35.383 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MILLION RATE AGAINST

03:31:34.081 --> 03:31:38.553 region:rollup2
ARE THOSE.

03:31:35.383 --> 03:31:39.720 region:rollup2
THOSE INSTANCES WHERE I MEET

03:31:38.553 --> 03:31:40.254 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY MENTIONED TODAY FOR

03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:43.591 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE A FIRE STATION IS

03:31:40.254 --> 03:31:44.125 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

03:31:43.591 --> 03:31:45.526 region:rollup2
YOU PLAN FOR THAT WHEN YOU

03:31:44.125 --> 03:31:47.461 region:rollup2
START.

03:31:45.526 --> 03:31:49.330 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ADDING ADDITIONAL

03:31:47.461 --> 03:31:50.565 region:rollup2
RESIDENCES THAT'S ALREADY IN

03:31:49.330 --> 03:31:53.668 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANS AND SPECIFIC

03:31:50.565 --> 03:31:55.403 region:rollup2
PLANTS AND SO. SO TO NOT HAVE

03:31:53.668 --> 03:31:56.270 region:rollup2
TOLD SOMEBODY UP FRONT THAT THEY

03:31:55.403 --> 03:31:58.272 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY INTO

03:31:56.270 --> 03:32:00.441 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT THEY DIDN'T DO THE

03:31:58.272 --> 03:32:02.577 region:rollup2
WORK. NECESSARILY TO BE ABLE TO

03:32:00.441 --> 03:32:04.312 region:rollup2
GET THAT FEE IN PLACE AND SO TO

03:32:02.577 --> 03:32:06.180 region:rollup2
STICK IT ON AT THE END REALLY

03:32:04.312 --> 03:32:07.682 region:rollup2
BLOWS THE BUDGETS BUT NOT SO

03:32:06.180 --> 03:32:08.950 region:rollup2
ANYWAY THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

03:32:07.682 --> 03:32:10.551 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE MOST OF THESE

03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:11.819 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ARE IN RESPONSE TO

03:32:10.551 --> 03:32:13.654 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HEARD.

03:32:11.819 --> 03:32:14.722 region:rollup2
AS DEAD AS THE BILL WAS WAS

03:32:13.654 --> 03:32:15.690 region:rollup2
WAITING IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE

03:32:14.722 --> 03:32:17.625 region:rollup2
AND IF I UNDERSTAND.

03:32:15.690 --> 03:32:19.827 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THAT.

03:32:17.625 --> 03:32:20.528 region:rollup2
THERE WAS ONE AMENDMENT THAT

03:32:19.827 --> 03:32:21.629 region:rollup2
YOU WERE SAYING.

03:32:20.528 --> 03:32:23.297 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT.

03:32:21.629 --> 03:32:25.032 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THAT WAS THE ONE

03:32:23.297 --> 03:32:26.934 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WEBSITE AND PUTTING

03:32:25.032 --> 03:32:28.903 region:rollup2
THE FEES UP THERE JUST JUST TO

03:32:26.934 --> 03:32:30.371 region:rollup2
STATE. THAT I AUTHORED A BILL

03:32:28.903 --> 03:32:31.739 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR THAT WAS IN THE

03:32:30.371 --> 03:32:34.075 region:rollup2
PACKAGE OF HOUSING.

03:32:31.739 --> 03:32:35.643 region:rollup2
AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THAT

03:32:34.075 --> 03:32:37.678 region:rollup2
CALLS FOR A STUDY.

03:32:35.643 --> 03:32:39.614 region:rollup2
FROM THE HOUSING AND.

03:32:37.678 --> 03:32:41.015 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THAT THERE BE

03:32:39.614 --> 03:32:42.683 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS TO

03:32:41.015 --> 03:32:45.886 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN ON THE REASON ABILITY

03:32:42.683 --> 03:32:47.588 region:rollup2
OF OF FEES AND SO POSSIBLY THIS

03:32:45.886 --> 03:32:49.323 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT WOULD FIT BETTER IN

03:32:47.588 --> 03:32:51.292 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HOUSING BILL THAT WOULD

03:32:49.323 --> 03:32:52.326 region:rollup2
COME FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN

03:32:51.292 --> 03:32:54.462 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN

03:32:52.326 --> 03:32:56.330 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED AND AND STUDIED OUT

03:32:54.462 --> 03:32:58.032 region:rollup2
SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AS AROUND

03:32:56.330 --> 03:33:00.334 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND UNDERSTAND THAT

03:32:58.032 --> 03:33:02.169 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE SOME STRIFE BETWEEN

03:33:00.334 --> 03:33:03.971 region:rollup2
THE BILL YOU HAVE VERSES. THE

03:33:02.169 --> 03:33:05.773 region:rollup2
WHAT THE COMMITTEES ARE TRYING

03:33:03.971 --> 03:33:07.508 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH AND HOPEFULLY THAT

03:33:05.773 --> 03:33:08.909 region:rollup2
CAN GET WORKED OUT AS WELL. A

03:33:07.508 --> 03:33:10.678 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS A REAL QUICK

03:33:08.909 --> 03:33:12.913 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE WAS TALKED ABOUT

03:33:10.678 --> 03:33:14.415 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE FAIRNESS OF THE

03:33:12.913 --> 03:33:16.651 region:rollup2
FEES AND THE WAY CITIES.

03:33:14.415 --> 03:33:17.785 region:rollup2
THEM HERE'S A RESULT OF OF OUR

03:33:16.651 --> 03:33:19.720 region:rollup2
PROP THIRTEEN AND THAT WAS THE

03:33:17.785 --> 03:33:22.123 region:rollup2
ONLY FOR CITIES TO RECOVER FROM

03:33:19.720 --> 03:33:24.058 region:rollup2
THAT WAS TO INSTITUTE FEES.

03:33:22.123 --> 03:33:24.425 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TAXES

03:33:24.058 --> 03:33:27.161 region:rollup2
AND.

03:33:24.425 --> 03:33:29.630 region:rollup2
I CAN GIVE YOU ANTIDOTE OF OF

03:33:27.161 --> 03:33:31.899 region:rollup2
IT OUGHT NOT ALWAYS BEING FAIR

03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:33.501 region:rollup2
BUT CITIES TAKEN ADVANTAGE. OF A

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:35.269 region:rollup2
PROJECT TO.

03:33:33.501 --> 03:33:36.437 region:rollup2
CREATE REVENUE WILL RAISE

03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:37.772 region:rollup2
REVENUE WHEN IT REALLY WASN'T

03:33:36.437 --> 03:33:39.040 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

03:33:37.772 --> 03:33:39.940 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY APPROVAL

03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:42.443 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

03:33:39.940 --> 03:33:43.044 region:rollup2
OF OVER THIRTY FIVE SQUARE FEET.

03:33:42.443 --> 03:33:45.246 region:rollup2
IN WHICH.

03:33:43.044 --> 03:33:46.747 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAD ALREADY

03:33:45.246 --> 03:33:48.582 region:rollup2
BEEN IMPROVED AT.

03:33:46.747 --> 03:33:50.151 region:rollup2
THE COST OF THE DEVELOPER.

03:33:48.582 --> 03:33:51.819 region:rollup2
AND YET THEY STILL CHARGED ó

03:33:50.151 --> 03:33:53.788 region:rollup2
SAID FEES.

03:33:51.819 --> 03:33:55.623 region:rollup2
FOR THAT SAME INFRASTRUCTURE

03:33:53.788 --> 03:33:57.758 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ALREADY IMPROVED.

03:33:55.623 --> 03:33:59.193 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE THEY COULD EVEN IN

03:33:57.758 --> 03:34:01.629 region:rollup2
THE APPEALS PROCESS SO.

03:33:59.193 --> 03:34:03.698 region:rollup2
THERE THERE ARE.

03:34:01.629 --> 03:34:05.966 region:rollup2
THERE IS GREAT LIFT LEGITIMACY

03:34:03.698 --> 03:34:06.200 region:rollup2
TO THIS BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO

03:34:05.966 --> 03:34:08.369 region:rollup2
SEE IT.

03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:09.637 region:rollup2
TODAY MOVE FORWARD AND SEE YOU

03:34:08.369 --> 03:34:11.272 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:34:09.637 --> 03:34:12.740 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH IT AND

03:34:11.272 --> 03:34:14.508 region:rollup2
THEN WE RE VISITED ON THE FLOOR

03:34:12.740 --> 03:34:16.110 region:rollup2
IF IT REACHES THAT FAR. AS TO

03:34:14.508 --> 03:34:17.812 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ABLE TO GET

03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:19.046 region:rollup2
TO A PLACE WHERE IT'S PALATABLE

03:34:17.812 --> 03:34:20.081 region:rollup2
OF FOR ALL PARTIES.

03:34:19.046 --> 03:34:21.382 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE

03:34:20.081 --> 03:34:23.284 region:rollup2
BILL.

PRETTY DRAMATIC AND ESPECIALLY

03:50:30.650 --> 03:50:33.386 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC BECAUSE YOU KNOW SALES

VARIOUS AREAS OF THE

HARDER TO CLICK CELLS.

03:50:58.845 --> 03:51:01.081 region:rollup2

BOTH OF THOSE REASONS ASK FOR A

03:51:01.081 --> 03:51:05.218 region:rollup2
