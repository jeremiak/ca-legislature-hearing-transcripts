THAT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:29.006
DIFFERENT AGENCY- THAT I SERVED

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.107

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.820
INTRUSION. AND THEY WERE GIVEN

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:46.223
A MANDATE BY THIS VERY BODY IS

TREMENDOUS AQUIFER THAT THEY

HAVE THERE. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:08.679
TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF IT WAS

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:11.248
NOTHING BUT- KICKING THE CAN

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:13.750
DOWN THE ROAD FIGHTING EVERY

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:19.022
DEADLINE ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:21.692

WANT TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHEN

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:27.497
YOU START THIS EXTENSION OF

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:29.833
DEADLINES. THERE'S ALWAYS

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.401
ANOTHER REASON AND THERE WAS

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:32.969
ALWAYS ANOTHER REASON WE DIDN'T

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:35.072
HAVE ENOUGH DATA THE EXPERT WAS

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:37.374
TIED UP DESERVES IT IN IT. AND

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:39.343
TO KICK SOMETHING DOWN MORE

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:43.447
THAN TWENTY YEARS- WAS WAS LIKE

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:45.115
I JUST LIKE VERY- IT'S VERY

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.783
DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE OF

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.385
THE TURRET COUNTY SO AFTER

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.153
SERVING FIVE YEARS IN HEARING

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.491
EVERY REASON UNDER THE SUN- AT

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:57.060
THAT- YEAH IT'S SERVING IN THAT

00:49:57.127 --> 00:50:00.163
CAPACITY. I AM VERY RELUCTANT

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.298
TO HAVE US BEGIN DOWN THIS

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:04.901
PROCESS- HERE SO- CERTAINLY

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.069
APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:09.139
AUTHOR- BUT I THINK IT IS

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:11.475
DANGEROUS FOR US TO DO THIS. WE

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:14.010
ALREADY HAVE THEY'VE HAD SEVEN

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:16.913
YEARS. SEVEN YEARS KNOWING

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.582
THERE WAS A DEADLINE WHEN

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.450
CULVER HT PEOPLE COULD SAY HEY

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.718
WORK WHATEVER WAS YOU'RE

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:22.619
PLANNING ON DOING YOU GOT IF

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:24.421
YOU HAVE TO GET IT DONE. BUT

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:26.723
INSTEAD OF ALWAYS THE DEFAULT

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.091
WHEN IT COMES TO GROUND WATER

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:30.127
SEEMS TO BE JUST PUSH THE

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.362
DEADLINE. WE'RE GOING INTO THE

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:32.996
SECOND YEAR THAT'S OF THIS

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:35.198
DROUGHT THE GROUNDWATER BASINS

FIRST TRIAL- IF WE DON'T. A

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.506
SENSE OF URGENCY AND HOLD

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.574
PEOPLE TO THAT SENSE OF URGENCY

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.910
I THINK WE JUST WON'T GET THE

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.245
JOB DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.313

PUMPING AT A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.387
I CERTAINLY RESPECT THE

00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:58.188
DIFFERENCES THAT WE MIGHT HAVE

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:01.158
ON THIS. AND CERTAINLY RESPECT

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:04.027

FOLKS JUST DON'T WANT TO

EMBRACE SIGNAL OR IS IT BECAUSE

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:38.889
OF OTHER THINGS IS BECAUSE A

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:40.657

MANDATORY EXTENSION SO I'D LIKE

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.236
TO CLEAR THE AIR ON THAT THIS

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:54.638
IS NOT KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:57.140
ROAD. THIS IS NOT DENYING THE

00:52:57.207 --> 00:53:00.143
FACT THAT SIGMA NEEDS TO GET

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:00.677

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:49.861
BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE.

02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:51.763
AND MANY WATER AGENCIES HAVE

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:53.198
INVESTED HEAVILY. IN THE PAST

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:54.266
SEVERAL YEARS AND WATER

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:56.201
EFFICIENCY TO MAKE SURE. THAT

02:12:56.268 --> 02:12:58.003
THEY ARE USING AS LITTLE WATER

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.571
AS POSSIBLE AND USING THE

02:12:59.638 --> 02:13:01.573
NEWEST TECHNOLOGY FOR- FOR

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:04.476

TERM WATER EFFICIENCY GOALS.

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:15.687
WITH THE METHODOLOGY FOR

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:17.589
SETTING WATER USE TARGETS

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:18.690
THAT'S CUSTOMIZED TO EACH

02:13:18.757 --> 02:13:20.926
AGENCY. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:21.760
DATA AND TECHNOLOGICAL

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.829
ADVANCEMENTS. THE CUSTOMIZED

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.030
TARGETS ARE BASED ON THREE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.865
STANDARDS. THE INDOOR STANDARDS

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:27.299
THAT ARE SET BY THE

02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:29.434
LEGISLATURE. THE OUTER STANDARD

02:13:29.501 --> 02:13:31.036
WITH THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:32.504
IF YOU ARE TO DEVELOP AND MAKE

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:33.805
RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE ADOPTED

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:35.841
BY THE STATE BOARD. AND A WATER

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.109
LOSS STANDARD THAT'S BEING

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:39.010
DEVELOPED BY THE STATE BOARD.

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.445
THE STANDARDS DO NOT APPLY TO

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:42.247
INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS. AND

02:13:42.314 --> 02:13:43.582
WATER AGENCIES DON'T EVEN HAVE

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.450
TO MEET EACH STANDARD THEY JUST

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:46.551
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH AN OVERALL

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:47.986
TARGET. THIS PROVIDES

02:13:48.053 --> 02:13:49.454
SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN

02:13:49.521 --> 02:13:50.956
WHOLE WATER AGENCY MEETS ITS

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:52.290
TARGET IF THEY'RE OVER THEIR

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:55.594
TARGET WATER BUDGET. IN TWO

02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:56.161
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE DIDN'T

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:57.796
HAVE ADEQUATE DATA ON INTER

STANDARD IN THAT ORIGINAL

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:02.000
LEGISLATION. SO THE BILL

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.769
INTRICATE. INCLUDED A PLACE

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.637
HOLD NUMBER. AND THOSE NUMBER

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.205
AND THEN WE DIRECTED D. W. R.

02:14:07.272 --> 02:14:09.508
THE STATE FOR TO STUDY. INDOOR

02:14:09.574 --> 02:14:10.675

FOUR TO UPDATE THE INDOOR

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:05.831
RESIDENTIAL WATER USE STANDARD

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:06.598
TO VALUES THAT MORE

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:08.333
APPROPRIATELY REFLECT CURRENT

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.801

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.136
RESIDENTIAL. WATER USE IN

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:13.305
CALIFORNIA. NOW IT'S NOT OUR

02:15:13.371 --> 02:15:15.841
INTENT TO INTRODUCE NUMBERS

02:15:15.907 --> 02:15:18.009
THAT ARE NOT ACHIEVABLE OR

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:19.644
STRETCH GOALS FOR WATER

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:20.812
AGENCIES. REGARDLESS OF WHAT

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:21.913
THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:23.682
STANDARD AT INDOOR WATER USE IS

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:25.317
DECLINING ALREADY. DUE TO

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:26.985
IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY

02:15:27.052 --> 02:15:28.119
REPLACEMENT OF OLD WATER

02:15:28.186 --> 02:15:29.387
FIXTURES AND A HIGHER COST OF

02:15:29.454 --> 02:15:31.490
WATER TO WATER USERS. SO WHY

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:33.792
NOW. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:34.459
LEGISLATION ASK FOR THE

02:15:34.526 --> 02:15:35.660

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:36.962
LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT THE

02:15:37.028 --> 02:15:38.129
STANDARDS BEFORE THE STATE

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:39.564
WATER BOARD BEGINS THE PROCESS

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.666
OF SETTING THE AGENCY'S OVERALL

WATER TARGETS IN TWO THOUSAND

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:44.669
TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION SETTING

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:46.137
THE INDOOR STANDARDS INFORMS

02:15:46.204 --> 02:15:47.806
THE PROCESS OF D. W. R. SAID IN

02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:49.374
THE OUTDOOR STANDARDS. IF WE

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:50.976
PUT OFF UPDATING THE UNDERSTAND

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:52.544
OR TO NEXT YEAR THE STATE MAY

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:53.678
ALSO NEED TO REVISIT THE

02:15:53.745 --> 02:15:55.180
OUTDOOR STANDARDS. WHICH COULD

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.915
THEN LEAD TO ANOTHER EIGHTEEN

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:57.883
MONTH RULE MAKING BY OUR STATE

02:15:57.949 --> 02:15:59.751

IN AB FIFTEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:53.838
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT. AT THE

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.106
TIME LIMITED DATA WERE

02:16:55.173 --> 02:16:56.675

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:29.040
FIVE GALLONS PER PERSON PER

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:31.176
DAY. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO

02:17:31.242 --> 02:17:32.344
STANDARDS AND CODES FOR

02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:35.513
APPLIANCES AND FIXTURES IN NEW

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:37.182
AND EXISTING HOME. SOME RAISE

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:38.483
CONCERNS THAT REDUCING THE AND

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:39.384
OUR STANDARD WOULD HAVE A

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:41.152
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW

02:17:41.219 --> 02:17:43.321
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER THE

02:17:43.388 --> 02:17:44.823
DRAFT STUDY RELEASED LAST WEEK

02:17:44.889 --> 02:17:46.558
FOUND THAT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD

02:17:46.625 --> 02:17:48.893
USING LESS WATER AND HIGHER

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:51.896
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SOME ALSO

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:53.832
RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:55.533
EFFECT ON RECYCLED WATER. THE

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:56.901
FRAMEWORK PROVIDES SEX

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:58.503
FLEXIBILITY TO ATTRACT THE

02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:00.639
CONCERNED BUT THE KEY POINT IS

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:02.173
TO RECOGNIZE THAT INDOOR FOR

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:04.075
CAPITA USE IS DECLINING DUE TO

02:18:04.142 --> 02:18:05.443

THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:35.713
THAT WAS STRUCK WITH THE

02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:37.548
PREVIOUS- BILL COULD YOU.

02:32:37.615 --> 02:32:38.916

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.651
THAT IF WE PUT THIS OFF THIS

02:32:40.718 --> 02:32:42.253
COULD DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:43.521
OF THE NUMBERS FOR UP TO THREE

02:32:43.587 --> 02:32:45.589

02:32:45.656 --> 02:32:47.091
PROCESS BUT WE NEED IT WE THINK

02:32:47.157 --> 02:32:48.192
WE NEED TO BEGIN IT NOW. I

WE'RE GOING TO DROUGHT AND WE

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:50.160
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:32:50.227 --> 02:32:51.829
AGENCIES ARE PRACTICING

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:52.897
CONSERVATION AND THAT MEANS

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:54.899
HAVING A STANDARD A TARGET. FOR

02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:55.766
EVERYBODY TO WORK ON THAT'S

02:32:55.833 --> 02:32:57.167
REALISTIC WE KNOW THAT THE

02:32:57.234 --> 02:32:59.670
TARGET THAT WAS IN THE BILL WAS

02:32:59.737 --> 02:33:01.105
ACTUALLY- HAD AN AMOUNT OF

02:33:01.171 --> 02:33:02.473
WATER THAT WAS LOWER THAN IS

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:04.241
ACTUALLY BEING USED. WITHIN THE

02:33:04.308 --> 02:33:05.643
STATE SO IF YOU HAVE A TARGET

02:33:05.709 --> 02:33:07.144
THAT'S TOO HIGH THAT'S ALREADY

02:33:07.211 --> 02:33:08.546
WERE ALREADY WITHIN YOU'RE

02:33:08.612 --> 02:33:09.713
REALLY NOT GOING TO GET ANYBODY

TO MOVE THE ENVELOPE VERY MUCH.

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:12.449
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN WITH

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:14.184
THE WATER AGENCIES THEY WANT TO

02:33:14.251 --> 02:33:14.785
MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN

02:33:14.852 --> 02:33:16.520
CONTINUE TO SELL THE WATER BUT

02:33:16.587 --> 02:33:18.255
THEY NEED TO SELL- AND THEY

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:19.089
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:20.391
THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE BUT- WE

02:33:20.457 --> 02:33:22.059
WILL WORK WITH THEM YOU KNOW AS

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:24.395

02:33:26.063 --> 02:33:27.665
GO FROM SLIDING OUT THE DOOR IN

02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:29.133

STAKEHOLDERS- THAT SPOKE TODAY

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.625

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.860
BE A GOOD- POLICY. KIND OF

02:33:56.927 --> 02:33:58.462
APPROACH. WOULD BE T

02:33:58.529 --> 02:33:59.797
POTENTIALLY BRINGS BILL BACK

02:33:59.863 --> 02:34:01.131
ONCE TERE'S SOME MORE

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:03.000

THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS

02:34:07.237 --> 02:34:08.372
TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE.

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:10.474
DELIBERATION ON IT AND THE

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.822
AND HAVING SOME ADDITIONAL

02:34:24.888 --> 02:34:26.323
INPUT I THINK WOULD BE A GOOD

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:27.591
PRACTICE FOR US. GIVEN THE

02:34:27.658 --> 02:34:30.227
TIMING- OF THE BILL AND THE

02:34:30.294 --> 02:34:32.529
LACK OF INFORMATION THAT WE'LL

HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY FEEL

02:34:45.709 --> 02:34:47.544
IS WORKABLE A TARGET THAT MAKES

02:34:47.611 --> 02:34:49.179
SENSE THAT GOES PUSH AGENCIES

02:34:49.246 --> 02:34:50.114
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AS GOOD WITH

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.215

WITH THE PROGRAM TO MAKE THE

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.685
INVESTMENTS. IN THE REPAIRS ARE

02:34:54.752 --> 02:34:56.453

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:03.894
ABOUT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE

02:35:03.961 --> 02:35:05.796
RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALL RISE OR

02:35:05.863 --> 02:35:06.997
FALL TOGETHER WE NEED TO BE

02:35:07.064 --> 02:35:08.332
ABLE TO HAVE THE WATER WHEN WE

02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:09.199
NEED IT THE MOST AND THAT MEANS

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:11.735
INVESTING IN. IN NOT JUST

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:13.537
