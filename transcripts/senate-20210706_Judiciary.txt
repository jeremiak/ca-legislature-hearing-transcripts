EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE THE HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND LEADERSHIP AND DETENTION ACT TAKES STEPS TO CLARIFY THAT ALL PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES IN THE STATE MUST ABIDE BY STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC ORDERS. AT PRESENT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SEVEN PRIVATELY OWNED CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES THAT HAVE A CAPACITY TO HOLD SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THESE FACILITIES POISE A UNIQUE AND CRITICAL CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND OVER THE LAST YEAR THEY HAVE BEEN THE SITE OF MASSIVE OUTBREAKS. OUTBREAKS IN THESE FACILITIES CAN QUICKLY OVERWHELM LOCAL HOSPITALS AND THREE MEDICAL RESOURCES THREATENING COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES THAT HOUSE IMMIGRANTS HAVE REUIREMENTS IN THE FEDERAL CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO AND SAFETY. THIS INCLUDES LANGUAGE REQUIRING EACH FACILITYTO COMPLY WITH CURRENT AND FUTURE PLANS IMPLEMENTED BY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ADDRESSING SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING COMMUNICABLE DISEASE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE PLANS FOR TESTING OR VACCINATIONS FOR COVERT NINETEEN TO HELP MITIGATE THE SPREAD INSIDE OF THESE FACILITIES. BY CLARIFYING THAT ALL PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES IN THE STATE MUST ABIDE BY STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH ORDERS EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE M. SHARES NECESSARY STATEWIDE COORDINATION THAT WILL SECURE OUR STATE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND BEYOND. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY MANY OF OUR STATE'S LOCAL COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS. ADDITION GROUPS IMMIGRATION RIGHT ORGANIZATIONS AMONG MANY OTHERS AND AS A BIPARTISAN AUTHORED BILL THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH. THANK YOU A SEVEN MEMBER OR ON THE LEFT- BEFORE WE PROCEED- ON THIS BILL WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM I SEE BUT A 100% REPUBLICAN DELEGATION IS HERE- IF WE MANAGE CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL THE PURPOSE OF A QUORUM. FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A QUORUM- BIRD HERE AMBERG HERE BOARD YES. PORGES PRESENT HEAVY AT ALL DID I SO DID I SO HERE GONZALEZ GONZALEZ HERE HERZBERG JONES JONES HERE LAYERED HERE LAYERED HERE STERN WHITE CASKEY HERE WHY CASKEY HERE WEINER. YOU HAVE- SEVEN PRESENT AND HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ALL RIGHT WE'RE STILL ON FILE I'M NUMBER ONE A. B. TWO SIX THREE LET ME MAKE ONE OTHER HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENT- EARLIER AG ARE TWELVE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE WAS LISTED AS A ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR THAT IS NO LONGER ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR AND WILL BE. PRESENTED FOR A VOTE- ALL RIGHT CONTINUE ON WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. TWO SIX THREE- I BELIEVE EUNICE CHOU IS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT PRIMARY WITNESS AND SUPPORT MODERATOR IF THIS SHOW IS AVAILABLE IF YOU WOULD OPEN THE LINE. COLLINSON LINE OPEN. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS EUNICE CHOU I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU'S NATIONAL PRISON PROJECT WHERE I WORK ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANT DETAINEES FACING UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE IS A CENTRAL LOOK LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION IN THE LAST YEAR TWENTY ONE PEOPLE DIED IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES THE HIGHEST IT HAS BEEN IN FIFTEEN YEARS. THOUSANDS MORE HAVE CONTRACTED COVEN NINETEEN DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE TENSION OPERATORS TO ENSURE SAFE CONDITIONS AND THE TENSION. CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO MORE WE HAVE SEEN REPEATED PATTERNS OF NEGLIGENCE AND MISCONDUCT BY PRIVATE DETENTION OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA. IMMIGRANT DETAINEES MAY BE IN THE LEGAL CUSTODY OF A FEDERAL AGENCY CALIFORNIA HAS CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PEOPLE IN DETENTION FACILITIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE IMMIGRANTS. STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE POWER AND THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE HEALTH AND SAFETY IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS INCLUDING THOSE OWNED AND OPERATED BY PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES. HOWEVER IT'S QUITE COMMON THAT THESE AGENCIES DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE THEIR AUTHORITY AND EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT PEOPLE IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE FACILITIES AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FACILITIES OWNED AND OPERATED BY PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATIONS OFTEN HAVE PERVERSE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO PAY LOWER WAGES AND CUT CORNERS ON HEALTHCARE FOR DETAIN PEOPLE AND COMPUTATIONAL SAFEGUARDS FOR WORKERS. AMONG OTHER PROTECTIONS EIGHTY TWO SIXTY THREE WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT CAL OSHA REGULATIONS ARE MANDATORY FOR THESE FACILITIES PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF-WORKERS CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN PASSING COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSTITUTIONALLY SOUND LEGISLATION. FOCUSED ON ENSURING PUBLIC HEALTH OVERSIGHT BY THE STATE IN THE FACILITIES THIS BUILD BUILD FROM THAT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND URGENTLY NEEDED DURING THIS PANDEMIC COULD SAVE HUMAN LIVES AND CLARIFY THE ROLE AND. RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH OVERSIGHT IN THE FACILITY. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT A B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS EIGHT. WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE ALARMING INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES AND TRAGICALLY. ORDERLY RIGHT INTO THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TO THE NATION. A CRIME TOTALS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN HIT THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER A DECADE WITH SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN INCIDENTS REPORTED. FBI DATA REVEALS THAT TWENTY NINETEEN WAS ALSO THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR HATE CRIMES WITH FIFTY ONE MURDERS. AND WHICH WAS A MORE THAN 1100% INCREASE OVER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN TWENTY TWENTY ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES SURGED BY ONE HUNDRED AND 49% AND HATE CRIMES AGAINST GAY MEN JUMPED NEARLY TRANSGENDER HATE CRIMES ROSE ABOUT 26% ALREADY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AS REPORTED A OVERALL AND A 26% INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION. BLACK PEOPLE REMAIN THE NUMBER ONE TARGET FOR HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA AT TWICE HE LEVEL THAT THEY REPRESENT IN THE POPULATION. WELL WE HAVE SOME DATA ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF HATE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING PERPETRATED. EXPERTS SAY THAT THE FBI DATA LIKELY UNDERCOUNTS THE NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA BOTH BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS DO NOT REPORT INCIDENTS AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT HATE CRIME DATA TO THE FBI. SO THE FBI RELIES ON THE VOLUNTARY REPORTING OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND PARTICIPATING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT MANY ARE NOT DOING SO. LAST YEAR 86% OF AGENCIES DID NOT REPORT A SINGLE HATE CRIME INCLUDING AT LEAST SEVENTY ONE CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE AND THE C. COALITION. DO THE STAGGERING STATISTICS AND CHALLENGES OF MONITORING COLLECTING AND ANALYZING THIS DATA IT IS CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA COULD USE BETTER TOOLS AND DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS TO HELP US TRACK. AND REPORT THIS INFORMATION FOR THE STATE. THE COMMISSION ON THE STATE OF HATE WILL MONITOR AND ASSESS CURRENT TRENDS RELATIVE DAY CRIMES PRODUCE ANNUAL REPORTS ON THESE TRENDS AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMEND STATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR. AND RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO HELP THE SAFETY AWARE OF ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY REDUCE INSTANCES OF THESE CRIMES. THE COMMISSION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHO IS PERPETRATING THESE CRIMES AND WHO'S BEING TARGETED. WHERE THEY'RE OCCURRING AND HOW WE CAN DEVELOP POLICY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE THE INSTANCES OF THESE CRIMES I AM PLEASED TO HAVE PROFESSOR BRIAN LEVIN THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF HATE AND EXTREMISM AT CSU SAMBAR TO DINO. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AS WAS STATED I BELIEVE WE HAVE PROFESSOR BRIAN LEVIN ON THE LINE. MODERATOR CAN YOU CONFIRM. I AM ON THE LINE.

INDEPENDENCE CRITICALLY WE'VE SEEN A 31% INCREASE ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S LATEST REPORT. WHICH JUST CAME OUT. THIS MONTH MOREOVER. 3282% INCREASE THAT WE FOUND IN TWENTY TWENTY OVER TWENTY SIX MAJOR JURISDICTIONS MARSHALL BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES THAT HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES INCLUDING TEXAS 18% IN NEW YORK CITY WHICH IS AGAIN A NEW IF WE LOOK AT THE 66% INCREASE IT WAS JUST REFERENCE IN LOS ANGELES FIVE HUNDRED AND NEW YORK CITY AND WHAT WE FOUND ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES ALONE. ENTRY USUALLY CURRENT LOAN LAST YEAR NATIONALLY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY PER. AND HE CONTRADICTS OR EVEN SINCE THEN WE SHOULDN'T BRING TO IN SOME. THE MEDIC INCIDENTS IN THREE WEEKS IN MAY AS MUCH AS THE WHOLE FIRST. AND WAS ALSO WITH REGARD TO EXTREMISM SOME TERRIFYING. DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM. WE'RE SEEING DIVERSIFICATION. WITH REGARD TO HOW GROUPS TO ORGANIZE SOURCING SHELLS AND VIOLENT LONERS INDEED IN FRESNO WHICH WE SAW. THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. A TRIPLE RACIAL HOMICIDE PRINCES BUT ALSO SEEING REGIONAL. HELD THESE. ENTITIES ARE OPERATING SO THAT IS SOMETHING AND ALSO THEY ARE OPERATING ON OUR COURT BASIS AND WHAT I USE. YOUR DINING FROM A BUFFET OF HATRED WHICH CROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM FOR INSTANCE WE'RE LOOKING AT. ABOUT AN 80% INCREASE LAST YEAR IN ANTI BLACK HATE CRIMES THEY ARE A HUNDRED AND. 10% INCREASE.

IS THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OR IS THERE SOME COORDINATION IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AT ITS CORE THERE'S THIS. BAD MO JO THAT'S GOING AROUND IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET A HOLD ON AND THAT YOU KEEP PEOPLE IN AND GET RECOMMENDATIONS HOW DO YOU SEE THAT. IF YOU SEE IT INTERACTING WITH THOSE OTHER ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN BOTH OF THE SORT OF LIBERTY WHICH TAKE THE QUESTION YES THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THE- JURISDICTION OF THE COMMISSION ON THE STATE HATE WOULD BE- JURISDICTION IN THE BROADEST SENSE- THE FUNDING-THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND THE- PAN LEGISLATION WERE. VERY SPECIFIC AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY IN THE FUTURE- FUNDING LIKE THAT OR BILLS LIKE THAT COULD BE WRAPPED INTO THE JURISDICTION OF THE OF THE COMMISSION- FOR WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE COMMISSION. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE SENATOR. THANK YOU- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- WHAT IS THE FEDERAL. DEFINITION OF HATE CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT TO EVERYBODY WITH HIS PROFESSOR LEVIN'S STILL ON THE LINE ELEVEN EXCUSE ME. YES I AM SIR PROFESSOR G. DONE IS THERE A FEDERAL DEFINITION FOR HATE OR HATE CRIME. ABSOLUTELY A CRIMINAL ACT W. CLARK MOTIVATED TO GO THE WHOLE. FOR ME TO SELECTION ALL OF OUR TARGET. ON BEING COVERED IN THE STATUTES SUCH AS RACE RELIGION SEXUAL GENDER IDENTITY IN ADDITION OUR MANDATE WOULD COVER. WHO ARE ACTING. WITH VIOLENCE TO PROMOTE THESE PARTICULAR GOAL SO FOR INSTANCE IF THERE WOULD BE A GROUP THAT WOULD TARGET WHITE REPUBLICANS EVEN COME UNDER THE AMBIT AS WELL GOT IT AND IS THERE A STATE WHERE. UNDER LAW. AND I'M SORRY REPEAT THAT PLEASE WHAT. IS THERE A STATE EQUIVALENT IN CALIFORNIA. NO BUT THERE ARE IN OTHER STATES. IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT YOU WOULD YOU BE USING FEDERAL DEFINITION FOR WHAT WOULD GO INTO THE HEAT JURISDICTION OF SUCH A- COMMITTEE COMMITTEE OR COMMISSION. TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE GENERALLY YEAH. I'M SORRY PROFESSOR AND I'M MOVING ON TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BLOOM EXCUSE ME. GO AHEAD SIR I'M TEMPTED TO SAY IN GENERAL YES BUT I THINK WE WOULD USE THE FEDERAL- DEFINITION OF GUIDANCE. OKAY- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL HERE IS THAT IF WE DID HAVE IT I DON'T KNOW IF IT EXISTS IF WE HAD THAT. INSTRUCTIONAL DEFINITION- AND- WE HAVE SEEN EXTRAORDINARY- AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED AAINST. THE BLACK COMMUNITY THE ASIAN COMMUNITY I MEAN THIS IS BEEN A VERY VERY DIFFICULT. AMERICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. WHAT I. ARE THERE ANY SAFEGUARDS IN THIS THAT TIE INTO POLITICAL SPEECH MEANING THAT IF THERE IS A MESSAGE THAT IS PUT FORWARD BY AN ORGANIZATION OR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT IS POLITICAL IN NATURE. WOULD THAT BE A TARGET FOR REVIEW BY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTION TO VIOLENCE. POLITICAL SPEECH IN AND OF ITSELF- IS CERTAINLY NOT THE TOPIC- OR JURISDICTION OF THE PROPOSED COMMISSION. NO DOUBT I'M I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE. COOL CONCERNED IF WE START GETTING INTO A NONDESCRIPT HATE JURISDICTION- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE APPARENTLY ONE FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WE COULD BE VEERING INTO- AREAS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF A HATE CRIME. SO ARE THERE ANY SAFEGUARDS FOR THE JURISDICTION THE CREATION OF THE JURISDICTION FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMITTEE. I THINK A PROFESSOR LEVIN MAY BE. THE BEST PERSON TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION TOO. YES YOU WILL BE MY PLEASURE AND I ECHO YOUR CONCERNS THAT'S WHY IT MUST BE A VIOLENT PREDICATE STORY NEWS. WE STARTED HOW DID WE NATURALLY INCREASING THREATS AGAINST ELECTED OFFICIALS PRESENT I THINK THAT WOULD COME UNDER THE AMBIT BUT THERE MUST BE A CRIMINAL PREDICATE WITH DISH AND THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR IN WHAT. WHAT WHAT THE JURISDICTION GENERALLY IS ABOUT THE PERMISSIBLE STATUS WITH REGARD TO PUBLISHING THESE KIND OF THINGS SO FAR. IN THE ABSENCE OF DESPAIR WITH ME. ONE SECOND. ONE THE WORDS AS OF IT I YOU FOR THROUGH THE WEEKEND TWENTY THREE BOTH FIRED SPEAK SENATORS NOW ABOUT. NO I JUST WANT. OUR COMMUNITY TO AT THE CONDITION OF THE ABLE TO LOOK AT UP WOULD YOU. THE GROUPS THAT ARE BY THE OTHER. FORTY SOME OF. ARE THE PRODUCT THANK YOU- AND I MY LAST IS. I'M A LITTLE. THAT THE FEDERAL- ASSEMBLY OF INFORMATION- YOU KNOW ON HATE GROUPS AND HATE CRIMES IS NOT GIVING US WHAT WE NEED. THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A STATE. ENTITY FOR THIS. SITE AS SOMEONE IN THIS WILL BE MY LAST. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AS TO. WHY WE'RE DEEMING THOSE FEDERAL ACCUMULATIONS TO BE DEFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSES THAT THE DEFICIENCY IS AS DUE TO THE LACK OF REPORTING- ON THE PART OF MANY JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND TO- SO AS LONG AS THE F. B. I.'S NOT REUIRING- REPORTING. AND RETRIEVING THAT INFORMATION. THERE'S THE P. I THINK- THE- STATISTIC WAS ABOUT 85% OF THE JURISDICTIONS SO WE'RE NOT REPORTING AND- AS IF THAT'S THE CASE WERE CLEARLY GETTING INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY. WE NEED TO. MAKE SOME EFFORT SOME SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION FROM OUR OWN JURISDICTIONS. OKAY SO IT'S BECAUSE THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT MANDATING- THE PRODUCTION OF THOSE. HATE CRIMES THAT THEIR DATABASE IN THEIR ANALYTICS ARE DEFICIENT IS THAT ACCURATE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. ALL RIGHT- WE HAVE OUR LEADERS BACK- WHAT DO YOU WISH TO TAKE OVER RIGHT NOW OR HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS- I HAVE NO COMMENTS THANK YOU CENTER BOARD JUST FOR YOUR VALIANT EFFORTS AS CHAIR APPRECIATED THANK YOU ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL ITEMS ON FILE SO.

THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE DELMAR BLOCKS AS WELL AS BEACONS BEACH. AN ACTIVE. LANDSLIDE AREA IN INSIDIOUS. THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE THE SCIENCE TO DEVELOP IN PHASE TWO THE EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IT IS MY HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL HAVE WARNINGS FOR THE FAILURES ON OUR WEATHER APPS MUCH LIKE WE DO. FOR HIGH WIND ADVISORIES OF FLOODING OR HIGH SURF ADVISORIES. THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER IN THE FACE OF SEA LEVEL RISE. THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS BIG HERE BECAUSE OF THE NARROW IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY FOR THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF RAL WORLD RESEARCH. WHICH IS LIMITED TO THE MEASUREMENTS PREDICTIONS AND WARNINGS OF THE SCIENTIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS PROFITEERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY OR DAMPER CHIEF CAMPUS COUNSEL AT UCSD. AND DEPUTY MAYOR RIGHT ONE FROM THE CITY OF TOMORROW. ALL RIGHTY- MISTER PARK OR DEPUTY MAYOR WHARTON. IF EITHER YOU ARE ON THE PHONE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN. ON THE ON. THE MARKET ON THE PHONE AS WELL ALL RIGHT LET'S START WITH YOU MUST PARK. GO AHEAD. I THINK YOU'RE ON BOARD. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAN PARK AND I AM THE CHIEF CAMPUS COUNSEL FOR UC SAN DIEGO. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNED A HOLE ABOUT BRINGING FORWARD THIS THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. A. B. FIFTY SIX TIMES CRITICAL RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSES AND WARNING SIGNS OF LANDSLIDES- THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL HELP. BUILD A WARNING SYSTEM ONE DAY. THAT WILL. PROTECT THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. THE REASON WE'RE HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE- AB SIXTY SIX CONTAINS THE TARGETED LIMITED. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAYBE SIXTY SIX INSURERS THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF LANDSLIDES WILL BE DEBATED AND RESOLVED IN THE PUBLIC FORUM AND NOT IN COURTROOMS. AB SIXTY SIX IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE MUCH LIKE THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR GOOD SAMARITANS. THAT IS CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL. LAW IMITATION OF. INCURRED PUBLIC CITIZENS TO RENDER AID TO WHO ARE IN DISTRESS. BY SHIELDING THESE GOOD SAMARITANS FROM LAWSUITS IF THE AID THEY RENDER IS LESS THAN PERFECT. THE PUBLIC POLICY BEHIND THIS LAW IS THAT THE RISK OF THEM PERFECT EIGHT IS BETTER THAN NO AID AT ALL. SIMILARLY AB SIXTY SIX ENCOURAGES THE SCIENTISTS WITH THE BEST CHANCEOF FIGURING OUT HOW WHY WHEN AND WHERE LANDSLIDES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR. TO DEVELOP THIS KNOWLEDGE AND SHARE IT WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT BY ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LANDSLIDES AND BLOCKED COLLAPSES. EIGHTY SIXTY SIX SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BY SAVING LIVES AND PROTECTING PROPERTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU A W. MEHR WARTEN. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS DWIGHT WORDEN I'M THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF THE CITY OF DELMAR JUST HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY LOOKS LIKE GUESTS HAVE OCCURRED IN DELMAR TO THE SOUTH TOWARDS PINES AND YOUR NORTH INTERMEDIATE ROADING UNSTABLE OCEAN BLUFFS COLLAPSE ON UNSUSPECTING BEACHGOERS ON THE BEACH. THIS PUBLIC SAFETY RISK WILL GET WORSE THE FEATURES NARROW DUE TO SAM LAW THE MOBILE RISE AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THERE'S MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ATTEND THE NARROWING BEACH AND COMPETE FOR SPACE NEARER TO THE ERODING BLUFFS THIS RISK EXISTS ALONG THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AFTER THE ACTION MORE DEATHS ARE INEVITABLE. DEVELOPING A WARNING SYSTEM IS THE ANSWER PUBLISHED STUDIES SHOW TWENTY NINE WARNING SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE ARE IN PLACE BUT NONE YET IN CALIFORNIA. WARNING IS CHEAPER AND LESS ENVIRONMENTALLY INTRUSIVE C. WALLS ARMORING AND STRUCTURES TO TRY AND FIGHT NATURE TO KEEP WHAT STABLES SCRIPTS INSTITUTE IS PERFECTLY POSITIONED TO DO THE DATA COLLECTION AND PILOT STUDIES BEACONS AND DELMAR CALLED FOR BY AT SIXTY SIX TRIPS ALREADY HAS EXTENSIVE DATA FROM YEARS OF BEACH INVOLVED MONITORING IN THE AREA STRIPS HAS TOP WORLD SCIENTISTS SCRIPTS KNOWS THE BEACONS AND DELMAR AREAS. INCLUDING THE REAL REAL RISKS ALONG THE BLOCK SCRIPTS CAN USE THE EXISTING STUDIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND WILL NOT BE STARTING AT GROUND ZERO. THE CITY OF DEL MAR HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING WITH SCRIPTS AND WELCOMES EIGHTY SIXTY SIX WE'RE A TOWN OF FORTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WELCOMING TWO MILLION PLUS PEOPLE PER YEAR TO THE BEACH WE WANT THEM TO BE SAFE AND WE CAN'T FOR MANY REASONS FINANCES BAYERN MENTAL AND PERMITTING ARMOR THE BLOCKS TO PREVENT OSS FALLS. AB SIXTY SIX PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE G. PILOT STUDIES TO DEVELOP WARNING SYSTEMS TO SAVE LIVES WITHOUT DAMAGING BEACHES AND BLUFFS WARNING SYSTEMS ARE NON INTRUSIVE AND RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE COMPARED TO THE OPTIONS THAT'S A GOOD. THING AND WORSE DURING DOING I URGE YOUR SUPPORT MAY BE THREE. THANK YOU THANK YOU- OTHER WITNESSES SOME. OF ABC SIX I SEEN OF THE GUYS C. A ROOM TWELVE.

ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN OPPOSITION I SEE NO PRIMARY WITNESS AN OPPOSITION LISTED- I SEE NONE OF THE GALLERIA SEE NONE OF ROOM ONE TWELVE. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. SIX SIX WE WOULD BE GRATEFUL. DON'T MAKE YOU LIKE TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY SIX THANK. YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AT THE TIME. AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE IN Q. ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING BACK TO THE FLOOR OF QUESTIONS COMMENTS I SEE SORT OF BORED JUST YES. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK HERE. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR- PURSUING THIS I'VE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME. IN THIS AREA AND I UNDERSTAND IF ANYBODY HAS GONE OVER OFF- TORREY PINES FOR EXAMPLE- THE EROSION THAT IS HAPPENING THERE IS. NOT ONLY IS IT ENVIRONMENTALLY SCARING BUT FROM A PHYSICAL STANDPOINT YOU CAN'T EVEN WALK ALONG THE BLUFF UNDERNEATH IT BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN FATALITIES OVER TIME HI THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE I'M I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THERE'S NOT APPROPRIATION ATTACHED TO THIS BUT NUMBER ONE WHY ARE WE- ORIENTING THIS TOWARDS SCRIPTS AND SCRIPT STEPS AGAIN TESTED BUT WHY THEM AS OPPOSED TO REACHING OUT TO. THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND OTHER- OCEANIC RELATED ORGANIZATIONS- AND- IN IN NATURAL. PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS THAT COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THREE WOULD THIS BE ESSENTIALLY A SOLE SOURCE. TYPE OF APPROPRIATION AT SOME LATER POINT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THOSE TWO ITEMS YES- THOUGH TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR SO THE MONEY'S THERE HAS BEEN SIGNED SO FIRST QUESTION. THINK TAKES CARE OF THE THIRD QUESTION TO THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY SCRIPTS SO THIS IS A VERY PARTICULAR TYPE OF SCIENCE OF UNDERSTANDING WHY PLUS FEEL. SCRIPTURES ALREADY STARTED WITH LIGHTER STUDIES IN THIS AREA AND THE SCIENCE THAT WE DEVELOP BEHIND LOVE FAILURES FOR THIS AREA. IS APPLICABLE STATE WIDE SO IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOU KNOW DOING IT FROM TORREY PINES OCEANSIDE IT IS- BE APPLICABLES STATEWIDE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE DONE THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION. DOESN'T DO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF- YOU KNOW Q. PHYSICS AND ON THAT TYPE OF STUFF THAT'S WHAT SCRIPTS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE USING SCRIPTS THEY'VE ALREADY DONE IT THEY HAVE THE KNOW HOW. AND THEY HAVE THE SCIENTISTS WHO CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I WENT TO SCRIPT AND SAID I WANT TO EARLY MORNING WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR BLOOD FIGURES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY SAID HOLD ON FOR A HORA FIRST WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND WE NEED TO KNOW WE KNOW BLESS FEEL AND WE KNOW AFTER THE FACT ONE OF THE FIELD WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PREDICT IT. SO THAT'S THE FOR THE EIGHTY SIXTY SIX OF THE FIRST PHASE OF A THREE PHASE PLAN THAT I HAVE AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL JOIN ME IN THAT JOURNEY- TO CREATE THE SCIENCE AROUND THE PHILLIES INCLUDED EARLY WARNING NOTIFICATION SYSTEM ALL RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE JUST TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T HAVE ANY SOLE SOURCE. RELATED ISSUES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE END OF THE MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE AND CAPABLE OF CONDUCTING THE STUDY. AND THAT THE YOU IDENTIFY THAT THERE DOLLARS ARE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE- I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND- BECAUSE I DO SUPPORT. IT MAKE THE MOTION AT THE PROPER TIME. THANK YOU- BOARD JUST MORE THE BILL. SAYING NO OTHER MICRO. RAISED- SO REMEMBER. BURNER OR BOX DO YOU CARE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLE. THERE CENTER BOARD JUST THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS AT SIXTY SIX A PRICE OF A MEMBER BURNER FOR BASH WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR BORDERS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBER HI. AMBER BY PORGES GORGEOUSI CAN BE AT ALL. YET ALL I DID I SO. DID I SO I WENT ON THIS. ONE SO THIS I. HURTS BURG. JONES LAYERED- LAYERED ICE STERN. WHITE HOUSE SCHEME BY BY CAL SKI I WINNER. WINNER I. GIVE THE EIGHT SO FAR ALL RIGHTY WE'LL PUT THAT BILL ON CALL NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER FIVE EIGHT B. FOUR EIGHT ZERO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAL. CLOSURES THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR EIGHTY A MEASURE THAT WILL STRAIN LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS. TO THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY INCLUDING THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECT A FACILITY OR A PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS THAT. COST AND EXPOSURE. IN CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE JURISDICTIONS OVER THE BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE OR GENERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIALS AND THAT POSE A RISK TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. LOCALLY A CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY ALSO KNOWN AS KOUBA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE LAWS AND THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER HAS GENERAL THIRTY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH EXPANDED THIRTY. ONLY AFTER A COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY IS DECLARED CURRENTLY. SOME FACILITIES THAT EMIT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CONTINUE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT EET REGULATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO CEASE OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES BEING THE EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA WHICH- CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS OF MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. AND OUR URROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF TOXIC LET. THE DELAY TO SHUT THIS FACILITY DOWN LED TO EMISSIONS FROM THE PLANT CONTAMINATING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND. OF OUR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ACROSS A NUMBER OF pCOMMUNITIES INCLUDING BOYLE HEIGHTS IN EAST LOS ANGELES AND I WOULD JUST SAY. NOT ONLY- RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES PARCELS INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND PARKS. EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY WILL ENABLE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECT THE FACILITY OR A PORTION OF THE FACILITY TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS. THAT HAVE EXPOSED OUR COMMUNITIES TO HARMFUL TOXIC MATERIALS UNTIL THE ISSUE WAS CORRECTED. FOR THE PAST TWO. YEARS I HAVE WORKED TO BRING GREATER AUTHORITY TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST THE THREATS OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I TOOK THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION WHO HAVE NOW GONE NEUTRAL. THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE COUPONS TO FOLLOW DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REGULATIONS WITH RESPECTS TO REPORTABLE AMOUNTS. INTO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ADOPTS ITS REGULATIONS ON THE SUBJECT. I HAVE ALSO ADDED LEGISLATIVE INTENT WITH RESPECT TO DESCRIBING WHAT IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL THREAT IS GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO STATUTORY DEFINITION FOR THE TERM AT THIS TIME. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. ON THIS VERY URGENT ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE AND SUPPORT IS JUSTIN ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER I JUST MILAN.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN BIRTHDAY COMING WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PALCO SPONSOR ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE MODERATOR IN SUPPORT. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN THE OPPOSITION I SEE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ANYWAYS DOES FIVE OPPOSITION IN THE GALLERY SEE NONE. REAL ONE TWELVE SAYING NONE- ON THE PHONE LINE MODERATOR ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE WISHES TO MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY. FOUR EIGHTY. IF YOU LIKE THE COMMON OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY. PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THE TIME. AT A TIME THERE'S NO WINNING QUEUE ALREADY THANK YOU I SEE SAID A WHITE HOUSE THESE MICROPHONES RAISE ENOUGH COME DUE NEXT AN EARLIER. THANK YOU MR CHAIR SITTING HERE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I WOULD NOTE THAT. THE STAFF REPORT PORT POINTS OUT THAT VIRTUALLY ALL THE NOTICE HEARING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES. IN THIS BILL ARE IDENTICAL TO EXISTING HAZARDOUS. MATERIALS LAWS IN THIS LAW ADDRESSES SPILLS AND RELEASES IN THE- THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS. ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT BY FILING FILING A WRIT OF MANDATE SO. I WOULD MOVE TO BILL AND APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER SUCH A- WELL CRAFTED MEASURE. ALREADY APPROVED AND APPLAUDED CENTER LAYERED. I WOULD SAY THE SOONER OUR CASKET JUST ACTUALLY MADE THE APPROPRIATE POINTS WHICH IS SPEAKING TO THE COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION. AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT IN THE BILL ON THE POLICY WHICH MIGHT NOT BE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT. THIS IS A LOGICAL NEXT STEP. BECAUSE THE COOPERS FLY UNDER THE RADAR MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE IF YOU IF THEY HEARD OF THOUGHT MAN YET. THEY'RE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN UNDERGROUND HAZARDOUS SITUATIONS OVER GROUND AND THEY PROVIDE A REGIONAL OR BROADER RESPONSE THAN JUST A SINGLE AGENCY AND SO GIVING THEM THE AUTHORITY. AN EMINENT THREATS IS A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY MOVE AND THERE'S A REASON THAT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION. IN THE ANALYSIS AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKIS MOTION. THANK YOU SIX ALERT ALL RIGHT. SIR RUSSELL THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR- I KNOW BECAUSE WE SHARE AN OVERLAP DISTRICTS THAT. THE ISSUES- BASE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES- WORK OF. EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY DANGER AND CONCERN AND I'M GLAD THIS SHE HAD PUT THIS BILL TOGETHER THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO SAYING NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRILL. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THINK THAT THE SENATORS FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND SUPPORT. GOOD LEGISLATION TAKES TIME AND IT TAKES BOTH OPPOSITION AND- THOSE IN SUPPORT TO COME TO THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY REALIZE. THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN MY COMMUNITY B. EXIDE BATTERY PLANT CONTAMINATION THAT LED TO A USC STUDY. THAT SHOWED THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR BABY TEETH HAVE LEAD IN THEIR BABY TEETH THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT IS SAFE FOR THE HUMAN BODY. AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND CLIMATE JUSTICE AND THE WAY IN WHICH GOVERNMENT IS MEANT TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE OFTEN PLACES WHERE WE GET TO CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH AND ALIGN THE LAW TO ENSURE THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. ARE PROTECTED AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO OTHER EXCITE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THAT HAVE GONE TOWARDS THE CLEAN UP. TOWARDS HOLDING DTC RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE AND THAT ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY EXIDE FILE BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS GONNA END UP BEING PAID FOR BY ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM AND BY THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. BECAUSE OF THESE AWFUL- REGULATIONS THAT WERE NOT TAKEN CARE OF AND SO THIS IS A- A RESPONSIBLE. AND PROACTIVE STEP FORWARD IT IS A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THAT WILL ENABLE OUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF. OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BETTER PROTECT OUR EIGHTIES HELP AND SEE. WHILE COORDINATING WITH THE PROPER AGENCY AND I RESPECT REQUEST AND I BUILT THANK YOU. A MAN INTO CUSTODY CALL RULES IN THE WHITE HOUSE KEYS MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THIS IS EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY FIVE FAMILY MEMBER CABRIO WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG HI. AMBER I PORGES. WE HAD A- ZERO I DID I SAW. THAT I SAW I HAD GONE SILAS GONZALEZ I HURTS BERG. JONES LAYERED LAYERED ICE STERN. WHITE HOUSE SKI. BY CASSIDY I WINNER WINNER I. YOU HAVE SEVEN TO ZERO SO AR ALREADY WE'LL PUT THAT BILLING CALL THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE A B. I REMEMBER TEN A. B. ONE FOUR EIGHT SEVEN BY SEVEN MEMBER GABRIEL. WHO IS PRESENT. REMEMBER GABRIEL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AT FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND KNOWN AS THE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION FUND TO PROTECT OUR MOST VALUABLE RENTERS AND HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE AGAINST. THIS BILL IS BASED ON THREE KEY NOTIONS THE FIRST IS THAT EVICTION DEFENSE IS KEY TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY FOCUSED ON HOW TO HELP FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST% INSTANCE AND THE DATA MAKES CLEAR TO US ON THIS THAT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION IS KEY. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON AVERAGE EVERY SINGLE DAY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN PEOPLE ARE PUT INTO HOUSING AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE BECOME NEWLY HOMELESS SO EVERY SINGLE DAY THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE AND WE KNOW THAT EVICTIONS ARE PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN DRIVING HOMELESSNESS AND SO IF WE WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE NEED TO ADDRESS. INFECTIONS THE SECOND IS THAT LEGAL SERVICES ARE AN EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE BEYOND. THAT AFFECT A BIT AND AN OVERALL EFFECTIVE SOLUTION AND AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES THE TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT WE'VE ENACTED RECENTLY ARE NOT SELF EXECUTING. THAT THEY REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL PROCESS AND RIGHTS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. WE ALSO KNOW FROM PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED AND RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE INTO THAT LEGISLATION. THAT RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS AND THIS IS. THE RESULT OF INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE AROUND THE SHRIVER PROGRAM AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE KNOW THAT. IN MOST CASES FOLKS WHO ARE REPRESENTED IN A FICTION PROCEEDINGS ARE 30% MORE LIKELY TO BE HOUSED. A YEAR LATER BASED ON THE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES THAT THEY'VE DONE FOLLOWING FOLKS WHO ARE IN A FICTION PROCEEDINGS HORTON WHO WERE WHO WERE REPRESENTED. AND WHO WERE UNDER REPRESENTED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE YOUR THESE PROGRAMS ARE PROVEN TO SAVE TAXPAYER RESOURCES AND ANALYSIS A BIT. OF FICTION DEFENSE PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES FOUND THAT FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED THERE'S ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A PUBLIC BENEFIT AND AVOIDED COSTS AND SO THE PROGRAM THAT WE- ARE PROPOSING TODAY- IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO LEVERAGE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS. AND AREAS OF EXPERTISE. AND THE THIRD PREMISE ON WHICH THIS BILL IS BASED IS THAT MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT 90% OF LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED- COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 10% OF TENANTS. AND THEN. AND THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. AND WE KNOW THAT THE REPRESENTATION DOESN'T CHANGE THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW IT DOESN'T CHANGE LEGAL RIGHTS OR DUTIES IT DOESN'T PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE. IN MERELY MEANS THAT EVICTION PROCEEDINGS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE DECIDED. BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW RATHER THAN SIMPLY ON THE ABILITY TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY AND SO THIS IS GOING TO HELP FOLKS. SECURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN A MANNER THAT IS GOING TO HELP SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES IT'S GOING TO SAVE TAXPAYER RESOURCES. AND IT'S GOING TO HELP OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM LIVE UP TO ITS IDEALS. AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF MORE THAN FIFTY. NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF OF ONE OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO SASHA HARMON FROM THE INNER CITY LAW CENTER. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SALOON NUMBER GABRIEL I WANT TO WELCOME OUR GUESTS IN THE GALLERY WERE PLEASED TO SEE CALIFORNIA'S COMING TO WATCH THEIR GOVERNMENT ACTION PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY- ALL RIGHT. TURNING TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS. THE ALEXANDER HARDEN. GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS ALEXANDER HARD AND OFTEN IN A SOFT HARD AND WITH THE INNER CITY LAW CENTER ARE PROUD TO. BUY INTO FORTY FIVE EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY THAT WILL HELP BENEFIT NOT ONLY FOR THE LOW INCOME RENTERS FACING EVICTION BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE COURT IN OUR STATE OF THE WHOLE. BILL INVENTED PROVEN MODEL THAT IS EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTUATE ANY AFFECTION PROTECTION THE LEGISLATURE. FOR BONOBO CALIFORNIA. THE BILL DOES NOT EXPAND OR INCREASE THE RATE DEPENDENCE WITH RESPECTIVE ACTIONS. BUT RATHER MAKE THE PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN PLACE REAL. PERTINENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND AN ATTORNEY. CONVICTION PROTECTIONS ARE MOSTLY WORKING AS INTENDED TO KEEP THE HOUSE. HOWEVER THE TENANTS ARE UNABLE TO. TO SECURE UNLIMITED LEGAL RESOURCES I'VE EXPERIENCED A RANGE OF CHALLENGES TRYING TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS IN COURT. EVEN WHEN THE PROTECTIONS APPLY TO ABOUT. PROGRAMS FUNDED BY A COURT EIGHTY FIVE AND WHAT. I'VE BEEN FOUND TO DROP IT IMPROVE CASE OUTCOMES FOR TENANT TO GO I'M REPRESENTED A PARK RATE DESCRIBED BY SOME NUMBER GABRIEL. LOCAL OF ALL BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY IN THE FORM OF DECREE SHELTER AND RELATED SERVICE PARTS BUT ALSO FROM INCREASED COMMUNITY STABILITY. AT THE SAME TIME THE VICTIM PREVENTION PROGRAMS CAN FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE COURT TO DECREASE FILINGS REDUCED ERROR COMPILING THINK CORPORATE THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED RESOLUTION OF CASES INCLUDING. BEFORE THEY EVER REACH THE COURTHOUSE STEPS. FINALLY PROGRAM FUNDED UNDER THE CAN IMPROVE RACIAL EQUITY IN CASE OUTCOMES AND HELP STABILIZE THE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY. RESULTING IN OTHER UNQUANTIFIABLE BENEFITS LIKE IMPROVED SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BY CHILDREN WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE DESTRUCTIVE. THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THE STATE'S ELECTION PROTECTION AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL WILL RESULT IN CRITICAL SAVINGS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO SHARE IN AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY WE RESPECTFULLY URGE EUROPE.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN NOW TO OPPOSITION I'VE TWO WITNESSES LISTED IN OPPOSITION- DEBORAH CALLED CARLTON IN JENNIFER'S SEX. THIS GIRL KNOW YOU ON THE PHONE. YES I AM THANK YOU SIR GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- DEBRA CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION FIRST I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT OBJECT TO THE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION ABOUT THE EVICTION PROCESS WHAT WE DO OBJECT TO HOWEVER IS THE METHOD USED BY ATTORNEYS TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO DOUBLE DELAYS THE DECREASE IN THE COURT. WE ALREADY HAVE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR LEGAL DEFENSE PUTTING ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION IN LOS ANGELES AND ANOTHERNINE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW THIS BILL INCLUDES FINDINGS ABOUT THE SUCCESS RATE WHEN DOLLARS ARE USED TO PROVIDE FOR LEGAL DEFENSE. IRONICALLY HOWEVER WHILE ATTORNEYS CAN HELP TENANTS TO BLADE TO DELAY THEIR OBJECTION IN NEARLY ALL CASES THE TENANT IS EVENTUALLY AFFECTED AND NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THE RENT IN MANY CASES BUT HOWEVER THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT OWNERS ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS TO EVICT TENANTS IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. AND IT'S TOO TIME CONSUMING YOU KNOW YOU CALL THIS A HOMELESS PREVENTION FUND IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS YOU SHOULD PROVIDE FUNDS TO HELP TENANTS PAY THEIR RENT WHEN THEY ARE TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO DO SO WITH THESE DOLLARS THEY WOULDN'T FACE AN EVICTION THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THEIR CREDIT CARD AND THEY COULD STAY IN THEIR RENTAL UNITS INDEFINITELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS CARLTON. SPEC. AFTER MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JENNIFER STACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE'RE TODAY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. WHICH ESTABLISHED OF THE HOMELESS THE HOMELESS PREVENTION FUND TO PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO TENANTS IN THE PACIFIC WITH ALLSTATE THE FREE LEGAL SERVICES SHALL NOT BE PROVIDED TO HOUSEHOLDS WHOSE INCOMES EXCEED. 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. HOWEVER THE BUILDER CONTAIN AMONG OTHER THINGS A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWED ANY TENANT REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME ELIGIBILITY. ACCESS TO FREE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE BELT. CONSIDERABLY A LITTLE ENCOURAGING HIGHER INCOME TENANTS TO ACCESS AN ABUSE FREE LEGAL SERVICES. AT FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FAILS TO REQUIRE EVEN THE STYLE VERIFICATION UNDER THE PENALTY OF PERJURY AS PROOF OF THE TENANT INCOME ELIGIBILITY. SIMPLY STATED THE BILL PROVIDES AN EXPANSIVE FUNDING SOURCE OF FREE LEGAL SERVICES THE TENTATIVE INCOME MAY WELL EXCEED THE 80% LIMITATION.

WE ARE THE JANITORS. THE GROUNDSKEEPERS. CAFETERIA WORKERS AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. YOU THE STATE LEGISLATURE GAVE US THE RIGHT TO STRIKE. AND WHEN WE THE WORKERS INSIDE EXERCISE THAT RIGHT. WE DO SELL AFTER WAITING ALL OTHER OPTIONS. BECAUSE WHEN WE GO ON STRIKE WE SACRIFICE. WE ARE PAID WE MAKE THAT SACRIFICE IN THE HOPE WE CAN IMPROVE OUR LIVES AND THAT OF OUR FAMILIES. HOWEVER THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR USING MEDICINE FOR LIFE SAVING TREATMENT AS A WEAPON AGAINST EXERCISING THAT RIGHT.

THAT WITHHOLDING AN EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE WHILE I'M STRAIGHT. APPALLING AND UNLAWFUL. THE CODE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC DEMONSTRATED UNMISTAKABLY. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT EVERYONE. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN AT ANY INCENTIVE TO REJECT PEOPLE FROM THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES THE DAMAGE TO THEIR FAMILIES INTO THE ENTIRE POPULATION CAN DO THIS AFTER. ALLOWING EMPLOYERS TO WEAPONIZE ACCENT HEALTHCARE SIMPLY TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN THEIR NEGOTIATIONS. NOT ONLY INCREDIBLY UNFAIR BUT DANGEROUS OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY. THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO EXISTING STATUTORY PROHIBITION AGAINST PUT THEM FOR YOU AT AN UNFAIR DISADVANTAGE AND EVEN THE THREAT OF SUCH ACTION BY AN EMPLOYER SERVES TO WEAPONIZE HERE IN THE RETENTION OF BENEFIT. UNFAIR SCARE TACTIC SHOULD NEVER BE USED. TO DISSUADE AN EMPLOYEE FROM THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHT UNDER THE LAW. EMPLOYERS MUST BE PROHIBITED FROM CONTINUING TO BENEFIT FROM THE DEGREE JUST BEHAVIOR. THE CALIFORNIA LABOR% FEDERATION BELIEVE THAT D. B. TWO THIRTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.

TO BE JUST A MOMENT- WE GO TO LINE ONE SEVENTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS TERRIBLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. VERY GOOD LET'S CLOSE PUBLIC CARE VERY IMPACTED- MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS- A SIMILAR GRAY I NOTICED THAT IN THE OPPOSITION IT WAS FILED BY U. C. THEN THE OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SAY. THEY INDICATED THEY'VE NEVER PROACTIVELY LOOK TO CUT OFF DURING A STRIKE THE HEALTHCARE BENEFITS OF FOLKS IN THAT THEY INDICATE THAT MOST OF THE TIME THE STRUCTURE A FEW DAYS AND THAT IN THEIR CURRENT LAW IF THE- IF THE EMPLOYEE WORKS HALF A MONTH IN THERE- A BENEFITS WOULD CONTINUE. TO SORT OF AN INDICATION THAT IT MAY BE. MAY NOT BE NECESSARY WHAT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THOSE. OF FORMAL OPPOSITION. YEAH I THINK. THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT CURRENT LAW DOES PROTECT WORKERS FROM THIS EGREGIOUS PACTICE HAVING SAID THAT I THINK- CODIFYING THIS PRACTICE AND THIS NORMAN HOPEFULLY ALL OF THIS BILL ONLY SPEAKS. TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS I WOULD HOPE THIS BECOMES THE NORM WITH EVEN PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IT IS JUST UNCONSCIONABLE AND WE'VE SEEN THIS- DURING THE PANDEMIC AS MANY SMALL. AND LARGE BUSINESSES- STRUGGLED TO ADAPT TO BASICALLY CHANGING CONDITIONS BY THE DAY. WE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY'S HEALTH CARE. TO GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND SO I THINK MAYBE TWO THIRTY SEVEN- MAKES THAT. MESSAGE SENDS THAT MESSAGE FRANKLY MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS THE PRACTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS OUR EXPECTATION AND FOR THOSE REASONS I THINK IT IS A CRITICAL BILL EVEN IF- YOU SEE OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER ASSERTS THAT. THEY CURRENTLY DON'T ENGAGE- IN DISMISSING- EMPLOYEES DURING A- WORK STOPPAGE OR STRIKE OKAY AND THEIR HEALTH CARE I KNOW I- HAVE GREAT INTEREST IN LAST YEAR'S BILL BY THERE YOU ALSO AUTHORED AB THREE TO FOUR- WHICH HELP PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE STAFF REPORT. IS HE TALKED ABOUT THE ACTIONS THAT- THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS- THE FACE WITH IT IN AN ACTUAL STRIKE THAT WAS. MY TRADITIONAL MODEL OF THE BAD EMPLOYER HURTING THE AND- THE EMPLOYEE I'M IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION I'M GONNA STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY JUST TO JUST TO BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- THE OPPOSITION. BUT I SEE TO WRITE- SENATOR ALSO YOU HAVE YOUR MIKE UP. YES THANK YOU- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR HAS INTRODUCED THIS BILL- THERE IS AN IMBALANCE CLEARLY AN IMBALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. WHERE IF THE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WERE. THAT WORK FOR THEM WANT TO GO OUT ON STRIKE THEY HAVE TO. THEY HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING FROM WHETHER THEY'LL HAVE INCOME OR NOT HAVE INCOME. AND THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FACE ALSO THE LOSS OF HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER WOULD STOP PAYING FOR THAT HEALTH CARE THAT IS NOT A PASSIVE DECISION THAT MAY BE. THIS IS A VERY SPECIFIC AND DELIBERATE DECISION. THAT WOULD BE MADE I SEE IN THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS- THAT THERE IS A BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE IT SAYS. YOU SEE CURRENTLY PAYS FOR COVERED HEALTH CARE COSTS DURING THE STRIKE AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYEE WORKS AT LEAST HALF THE HOURS WE MUST NOT A STRIKE. AND IF YOU'RE ON STRIKE YOU KNOW WORKING HALF THE HOURS SO CLEARLY THE POLICY OF UC AND IN THIS CASE I'M JUST REFERRING TO THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR RESPONSE. CLEARLY THEY'RE MAKING A DECISION THEY WOULD MAKE A DECISION TO NOT COVER HEALTH CARE DURING THE STRIKE. THEY'RE ALREADY THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY HAVING TO FACE NO NOT HAVING ANY INCOME. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT I THINK THIS IT'S AN ABUSE OF THE POWER- I THINK IT'S INHUMANE AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT- WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS NOW. FROM AND THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY SAY ALSO THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT IMPEDE AN EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT TO STRIKE. THE FACT ALL BY DENYING THEM ON BY ACTIVELY DECIDE DECIDING NOT TO PAY FOR THE HEALTH CARE THEY ARE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF IMPEDING THAT EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO STRIKE SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AND- I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS AS WELL THANK YOU. OTHER MEMBERS. A SUMMARY BROTHER THAT- A SECOND SENTENCE OKAY SORRY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I KNOW IT'S HARD DURING UP THERE AND SING THE GLARE BUT- I TOO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT- THIS IS A PRACTICE GOING ON. IN OUR STATE. AND SO- OF COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'D LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR- BUT AS THE STATE IS MAKING. INCREDIBLE INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR FOLKS. THIS MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. AND SO I REALLY- YOU KNOW KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TAKING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THAT SENSE TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOLKS TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE. THEY HAVE COVERAGE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT IS A BASIC RIGHT THANK YOU. I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP OF SEVEN OR GREATER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU- SENATORS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND DELIBERATION I DO THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL AND I'LL JUST SAY THIS I HAVE A YOUNGER SISTER WHO LIVES WITH TYPE ONE DIABETES AND SHE'S LIVE WITH THAT CONDITION SINCE SHE WAS TWO YEARS OLD. AND IF MY MOTHER WERE FOR THE POSITION OF LOSING. HER HEALTH CARE STANDING UP FOR HER RIGHTS AND HER PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND SHE HAD TO CONSIDER THE LOSS OF HEALTH CARE WHAT THAT PRACTICALLY MEANS FOR MY LITTLE SISTER. OR ANY OTHER FAMILY FACING SIMILAR CONDITIONS IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND- ALTHOUGH AS WE SAID THIS DEBATE YOU CAN POINT TO. A CURRENT LAW WHICH SOME ARGUE PROHIBITS THIS PRACTICE ANYWAY- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM SACRAMENTO A CLEARLY IN STATUTE I OPENED UP. SAYING THAT THIS BILL SIMPLY PROHIBITS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS FROM TERMINATING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE DURING THE WORK STOPPAGE OR STRIKE PERIOD THE END. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION- AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU I VOTE. THIS AFTERNOON. AND THERE IS A MOTION BY. SENATOR ALSO- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS EIGHTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN BY A FAMILY MEMBER GRADE A MOTION BY SENATOR DID ASO MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG BOARD YES W. AT ALL.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHERRIN SENATORS I WOULD LIKE TO START RETHINKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY TEAM TO DRAFT SOME GREAT AMENDMENTS THAT I BELIEVE STRENGTHEN OUR BILL. AB FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR TAKES A THREE PRONGED APPROACH PROTECT CONSUMERS AND HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. FIRST ENSURE THAT FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS AND ONLINE DIRECTORIES PROVIDE ACCURATE BUSINESS INFORMATION SECOND IT PROHIBITS THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS IN CHARGING RESTAURANTS FOR RAPID CALLS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A PAID ORDER AND THIRDLY THERE REQUIRES ALL FUTURE CONTRACTS IN A FOOD FACILITY. AND FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS INCLUDE CLEAR INFORMATION OF ALL POSSIBLE CHARGES OR FEES THAT MAY BE INCURRED ON TO THE RESTAURANT AND PROVIDE INFORMATION LISTING WEBSITES WE PARTNER WITH THE FOOD ORDER BY FORM. AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMY MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BECOME MORE LINE ON THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORM SURVIVE. GIVEN THAT RESTAURANTS ARE EXISTENTIALLY RELIANT ON THESE SERVICES THERE'S SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN BARGAINING POWER BETWEEN THE PLATFORMS AND RESTAURANTS AND DESPITE GROWING COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE THE FOOD DELIVERY INDUSTRIES PRIMARILY CONTROLLED BY ONLY FOUR COMPANIES. UBER EATS POSTMATES DOORDASH AND GRUBHUB COMPRISE. 99% OF SALES IN THE FOOD DELIVERY MARKET. THE PANDEMIC IT IS CLEAR THAT BIG MONOPOLIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW ECONOMIC REALITY. WHILE MANY RESTAURANTS HAVE STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE THIS IS EVIDENT WITH OVER FORTY THOUSAND RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE CLOSED THEIR DOORS IN CALIFORNIA WHILE THESE FOOD DEALER PLATFORMS HAVE GROWN. THEIR PROFITS EXPONENTIALLY TO THE XENA PHOBIC AND MISINFORMED NARRATIVES SURROUNDING COVER NINETEEN THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FELT EVEN HARDER. BY ASIAN AND ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES. IT IS CRITICAL WE PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOLS ARE PROTECTIONS TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THEY ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE RECOVER AND THRIVE. HE MUST ENSURE THEY ARE NOT BEING EXPLOITED BY BIG TECHNOPOLIS THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THE SILICON VALLEY CHAMBER COALITION WHICH IS MADE UP OF EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE.

PROVIDING ACCURATE BUSINESS INFORMATION WILL ALSO ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY INFORMING THE CONSUMER ABOUT WHO THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING BUSINESS WITH. WHAT WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS A LOT OF BUSINESSES HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO BECOME MORE RELIANT ON THIRD PARTY FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS. THE LOCAL HEALTH RESTRICTIONS WE ALSO SAW THAT THE AVERAGE RESTAURANT PROFIT MARGIN FALLING BETWEEN CAN HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES. IT'S NO SECRET APPARENTLY SAW SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT THEM COMING UPON ALL OF YOU AT THE STATE CAPITOL TO ENSURE OUR BUSINESSES DON'T SUFFER THESE CONSEQUENCES. BY PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS AND LETTING THEM KNOW ABOUT THE THAT THEIR THEIR ACTIONS. MAY INCUR COSTS TO RESTAURANTS A. B.

THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. AREN'T VERY GOOD OF LET'S FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE WITH THE OPPOSITION UNDERSTAND WE HAVE DAVID NELSON AND HANNAH SMITH- ON THE PHONE TODAY TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION MISS SMITH PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AMERICAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS HANNAH SMITH AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF GRANDPA. I'D LIKE TO THINK SHARE ON BERGEN AND STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON AT FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR IN REMOVING ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS ON THIRD PARTY LISTING WEBSITES. WE REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROVISION PROHIBITING THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS FROM CHARGING RESTAURANTS FOR ROUTE A CALL BUT DID NOT RESULT IN BORDERS. HOWEVER STRONGLY OPPOSES THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE OF THE RESTAURANT PHONE NUMBERS ON THE THIRD PARTY LISTING WEBSITE. CERTAINLY THE THAT HE WHEN THE BIBLE AND GROWING RESTAURANT COMMUNITY THAT IS ABLE TO BALANCE INTEREST UNTIL EVERY OPTION FOR DINERS. WHAT ABOUT COMMUNITIES WORKING ALONGSIDE AND WITH RESTAURANTS TO SUPPORT THEIR GROWTH. GRUBHUB CONTRACTS WITH RESTAURANTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY TO PROVIDE PHONE ORDERING SERVICE. I'M INTERESTED IN THIS BILL REQUIRES POPCORN TWO PHONE NUMBERS FOR THESE RESTAURANTS A UNIQUE PHONE NUMBER OF THE SERVICE THAT THEY ARE CONTRACTED WITH GRUBHUB TO PROVIDE. THE RESTAURANT DIRECTION NUMBER. BEYOND BEING CONFUSING FOR CONSUMERS THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED REQUIREMENTS IT WOULD HURT THE ABILITY FOR RESTAURANTS TO RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AS THEY SEE FIT. DURING THE SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH RESTAURANTS THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE HOW THEIR ORDERS ARE BEING GENERATED BY. I ON ORDER NUMBER CONSTANT PHONE NUMBERS AND ABLE REAL TIME MARKETING MEASUREMENT AND ALLOW RESTAURANTS TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHICH MARKETING TOOLS WORK. BY GENERATING ORDERS AND WHICH DO NOT. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE BILL GO BEYOND OLDER GENERATION RESTAURANT CONTRACT ABOUT TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. FREQUENTLY AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE HEAR HOW THE SERVICE IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED SHORTAGE OF HOSPITALITY STAFFERS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS OVERCOMING LANGUAGE BARRIERS. FOR RESTAURANT OWNERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MAKE NO MISTAKE. THIS BUDGET AT THIS LEGISLATION WERE TO PASS IT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MANY SMALL IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES. WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE CHAIR NUMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR SOME TIME AND RECOGNIZE THAT. MEETING AT THE CAMP PROGRESS AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU DAVID NELSON PLEASE PROCEED. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IN- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS DAVID MALCOLM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- REPRESENTING THEIR RESPECTIVE- THOUSANDS OF APIAPI OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT THE STATE- AND IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON ALREADY EXISTING CONTRACTS. THAT HAVE BEEN SIGNED IN GOOD FAITH IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT BUSINESS OWNERS. FRANKLY THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY GO INTO CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS THAT HELP AND SUPPORT THE BUSINESSES. SHOULD THINK THAT THEY ARE DUPED OR THAT THEY HAVE THE INABILITY. TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACT WHICH THEY ARE GETTING INTO I THINK IT'S A DISCREDIT TO- THE INTELLIGENCE OF ALL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I WOULD LIKE TO REFERENCE THAT FORTY ONE PERCENT. OF PHONE ORDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM BROKE GRUBHUB COME FROM ASIAN RESTAURANTS. THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE STREAM FOR API RESTAURANT. ANY. DISRUPTION OR CONFUSION ABOUTSERVICE WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE BOTTOM LINE OF ASIAN RESTAURANTS AND ON TOP OF THAT AS WE ALL KNOW THERE IS A WORKER SHORTAGE AND THIS IS PART OF THE SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS CONTRACT BETWEEN IN THIS CASE FOR A PUBLIC AND A PRIVATE AND A PRIVATE RESTAURANT WE NEED TO HONOR THAT AND WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT WILL HELP MAKE BUSINESSES GROW. UP LIKE THIS LIKE THIS HELP BUSINESSES TO GROW I WOULD- I WOULD POSE THAT IF. THESE SERVICES HAD NOT BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE LAST YEAR WE WOULD SEE EVEN MORE BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY WITH IMMIGRANT OWNED BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS. OUT OF. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE POSED.

HIS TIME AND WILLINGNESS TO. DISCUSS IT I JUST. YOU'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENTS SUNNY AND CONCERNS ME. A LITTLE BIT HERE AND EAT IT WAS THE ARGUMENT BY THE- ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE. AND I LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS SORT OF SPONSOR STARTS ON THIS- THERE'S A GAP CALLED OPEN TABLE WHICH IS KIND OF A COOL APP. IF IT'S A RESTAURANT WHAT I DO IS I GO TO OPEN TABLE AND I SAY- I WANNA RESERVATION BECAUSE I'M HAVING DINNER WITH SENATOR ALSO. IN THE TWO OF US ARE GOING TO BE THERE THAT NIGHT AND CAN YOU DO IT AND I HOPE THE TABLE THEN CONTACTS THE RESTAURANT. GETS THE RESERVATION I HAVE A LITTLE THING ON MY PHONE WHEN I GO THERE IT SHOWS THAT. WERE AVAILABLE FOR THAT. SO BUSINESSES CHOOSE THE OPTION SO THE QUESTION HERE IS THE YOU KNOW HEY I DO UNDERSTAND THE POINT ABOUT THE BARGAINING DESPITE BARGAINING POWER THAT YOU MAKE AS AN UNDERLYING IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WE SAW IN THE LAST BILL. AS WAS DISCUSSED. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW A BIT IF A BUSINESS WANTS TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. COULD THEY- HAVE AN OPT OUT PROVISION THAT SAYS I WOULD RATHER I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TELEPHONE CALLS. DURING SOME OF THE HOLIDAYS RECENTLY WHEN I TRY TO GET STUFF DELIVERED TO THE HOUSE RECALLED SOME RESTAURANTS IS ONE IN PASADENA. WHICH I LOVE AND THE LIKE AND WE TRIED TO CALL THE TAKE THAT ORDER WE COULDN'T GET IN ORDER TO THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT ON THE PHONE. THEY MADE US GO TO THEIR APP. OR GO TO SOME OTHER APP TO GO TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BUSY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE BURDENED BY IT. SO FOR PURPOSES OF FLEXIBILITY IN THIS KIND OF NEW WORLD WE LIVE IN WITH THIS. THESE COMPUTER THINGS IN THESE PHONE THINGS WE GOT OUT THERE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME TIME AGO. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE AN OPT OUT PROVISION THAT SAYS OKAY IF I'M A BUSINESS AND I WANT TO SIGN A CONTRACT AND I WANT TO SUBCONTRACT OUT. TO SOME COMPANY LIKE OPENTABLE. TO DEAL WITH MY ORDERS OR WHOEVER ELSE IT. MAY BE. WHAT DO YOU WHAT YOU THOUGHT IN THAT REGARD SO YOU DEAL WITH THIS TELEPHONE ISSUE. BECAUSE THAT'S THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE FROM A BUSINESS. IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE COMPLETELY AGAINST MY INTERESTS IN TERMS OF HOW I CHOOSE TO DO BUSINESS YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT YOUR. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER THROUGH THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK THE HEART OF THE ISSUE REALLY IS THE INFORMED CONSENT INFORMED AGREEMENT. SO YOU HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT IT MIGHT BE INSULTING TO SMALL BUSINESSES THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONTRACTOR SIGNING I WILL SHOW YOU THIS IS FROM BROOKLYN SITE. THIS IS THE CONTRACT THAT THEY SIGN. THAT SAID. AND IT TOOK AWHILE FOR ME MY TEAM TO EVEN UNDERSTAND THE TEN EIGHT POINT. FINE FINE PRINT RIGHT HERE. AND THERE IS NO MENTION ABOUT CALL FORWARDING I WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT PRIOR TO THIS BILL BEING INTRODUCED. AS PRIVATE OPPOSITION THERE WERE TWO PHONE NUMBERS LISTED BEFORE ONE THAT WAS. A NUMBER CREATED BY GRUBHUB ON YELP. I'M THE ONE THAT DIRECTLY WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND IN THE ANALYSIS THERE WAS A- IT'S LIKE THEY GET ADVICE PIECE THAT TALKS ABOUT. WHEN CUSTOMERS GO TO COLD COLDER THROUGH. THAT YUP CRITICAL NUMBER EIGHT IT'S USED AS A REFERRAL FEE A MARKETING FEE THAT'S ASSESSED ON BUSINESSES AND WE KNOW IT'S SMALL RESTAURANT SMALL RESTAURANTS. THE PROFIT MARGINS ARE RAZOR THIN AND ADDING ON A MARKETING CHARGE. REALLY HURTS BUSINESSES SO IN THE COURSE OF THIS BILL INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH YELP WHICH SUBMITTED A LETTER OF NEUTRALITY. ACTUALLY DISCONTINUED THE PRACTICE ALTOGETHER SO THE PRACTICE OF THE BILL IS. IS HOPING TO ENSURE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS IN THE REAL WORLD NOW. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS SERIOUS BECAUSE THE REAL PART IS YOU KNOW A BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY CONTRACT WITH AN OPEN TABLE OR- ANY SORT OF DIFFERENT VENDORS AND THIRD PARTY APPS. BUT HE NEED TO BE KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO. AND IN THE CASE OF CALL FORWARDING IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CONSUMER DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE CHARGING RESTAURANT AND THE RESTAURANT. WAS ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING. SO IF A RESTAURANT WANTS TO SPEAK WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO SPEED THE MARKING CHARGE WHICH- AND I HAD TO READ THROUGH SEVERAL DOCUMENTS. FALLS FROM EVERYTHING FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TO PRINT MEDIA TO PHONE ORDERS IT'S SUCH A HUGE PART OF THAT. IF YOU'RE A SMALL BUSINESS THAT'S WORKING. YOU KNOW YOUR FAMILY AND YOU'RE WORKING ALL THE HOURS YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE TIME JUST. RINSE THE WRINKLE FOR EVERYTHING. AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO DO AND THAT'S WHY WITH THE CHAIRS AND DOOR WITH THE WORK OF THE CHAIR. HE ALSO MORE DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE TO MAKE OUT WHAT THESE FEES ARE GOING TO BE SUCH A BETTER INFORMED- GRIMMETT. CHECK ASK. FOR THE QUESTION FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THE MAJORITY LEADER YOU MAY. THANK YOU KIND SIR. ON A COMPLETELY ON THIS WHOLE WE CALL ON THE LINE HE'S IN CONTRACTS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS AND WE DEALT WITH THIS INITIAL PRIVACY THAT WE DEALT WITH OVER MANY MANY YEARS. AND YOU SEE THESE THESE- THESE DOCUMENTS ARE SO LONG EITHER PHD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY SAY I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT'S THE ISSUE. SO IF YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS LAW AND SAY OKAY THESE HAD TO BE IN SO MANY POINT TYPE. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WOULD REDUCE IN THAT REGARD. WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS. OKAY INFORMED CONSENT. PUT A BOX ON THERE RATHER THAN SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PHONE NUMBER IF I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE PHONE CALLS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY. IN OUR CONTRACT OUT THOSE PHONE CALLS TO SOMEBODY ELSE. WHY CAN'T I AS A BUSINESS LIKE AN OPEN TABLE. CHOOSE TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. NOW YOU CAN MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR. THAT WHEN YOU SIGN A CONTRACT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS IS WHY YOU'RE DOING IT HERE'S THE CHARGE FOR DOING IT. BUT WHY COULDN'T I GIVE TO OPENTABLE TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND NOT BE BOTHERED. TO HAVE PHONE CALLS COME TO ME AGAIN IF I WANT TO I CAN. BUT WE'RE DOING AS A GOVERNMENT. IS WE'RE MANDATING THAT THAT'S ON THERE. AND THE QUESTION IS. WHO WE PROTECTING. THE PROTECTION DOESN'T OCCUR AT THE WITH THE PHONE NUMBERS THERE. THE PROTECTION OCCURS. TO THE BUSINESS OWNER AT THE TIME THE CONTRACTS SIGNED. SO THAT'S THE INFLECTION POINT WHERE YOU PROTECT SOMEBODY. AND YOU SAY YOU'RE SIGNING A CONTRACT THESE ARE THE TERMS. YOU KNOW YOU NEED A LAWYER OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE BUT THAT'S THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHENYOU MAKE THAT DECISION. AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR. NOT MANDATING HOW YOU WANT TO. TAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS. I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING AN OPT OUT PROVISION. OR HAVING SOME DISCLOSURE IN A WAY THAT IT WAS BIGGER PRINT. OR SOMETHING WOULD BE. ACHIEVE EXACTLY JUST AS YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE. WITHOUT TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY OF THE THEY WANT HOW THEY WANT TO DO IT BUT YOU REALLY PROTECTING AT THE SAME TIME HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU BY. I THINK THAT KIND OF HELPS DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR EXPERT. YEAH NUMBER LI YOU CARE TO RESPOND OR IN YOUR CLOTHES I WAS ON MY CLOTHES ALL RIGHT. OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS SAYING NONE IS THERE A MOTION. SEND A COUPLE YEAR ALMOST THE BILL. ALL RIGHT- YES SIR- HURTS BIRD. ALL I'M SAYING IS I RAISE THAT ISSUE I KNOW THAT YOU YOU YOU WERE VERY GRACIOUS TAKING A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS. THAT THE CHAIR ASKED FOR IN YOUR COMMITTEE YOUR STAFF WORK VERY WELL WITH THE COMMITTEE. I THINK WHAT I'LL DO HERE TODAY IS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE CHANGES SOMEHOW ALONG THE PROCESS SO VOTE FOR YOUR- MEASURE TODAY BUT I WANT TO CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT I THINK YOU SHOULD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THAT REALLY ACHIEVE YOUR OBJECTIVE ON THE ONE HAND AND AVOIDS THE COMPELLING BUSINESSES HOW THEY DO THEIR THE OTHER AND ALL WITH HOLD THE RIGHT TO VOTE AT- AT A LATER TIME ON THE FLOOR. IN OTHER INSTANCES THANK YOU- SENT A COUPLE YEAR THAN ARE ALSO I'M OPEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT A SECOND WOULD- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES SAID I HI THE FIRST. ITERATION pLITTLE BIT CONCERNED WITH TELLING PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS THEY CAN HAVE WHEN IT'S VOLUNTARILY ENTERED ITO BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR A SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT IT'S NOT AN EQUAL. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THESE COMPANIES BUT BUT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS TO OFFLOAD SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND I GOT TO SAY THAT IT'S REALLY HARD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S OPEN. AND YOU'RE CALLING AND THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT OPEN AND SO IT IT TO BE ABLE TO OFFLOAD THE NEED TO ANSWER PHONES- MAY BE A BENEFIT TO A SMALL BUSINESS AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. THANK YOU SENT A COPY OF SOME OF RUSSELL THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION. RIGHT IS SOME OF ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I LOOK AT THE BILLS IS TO SEE WHO SUPPORTS AND WHO OPPOSES OF COURSE. AND I'M INTERESTED I'M CURIOUS ON THE SUPPORT SIDE THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- AND OTHER CHAMBERS. ALONGSIDE THE CONSUMER FEDERATION- AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OTHER- CHAMBERS SO I'M UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE INTERESTS ARE HERE. THAT LEADS TO- BUSINESSES US SUPPORTING AND THEN. BUSINESSES OPPOSING ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY APPEARED TO BE THE SAME KIND OF BUSINESSES. SIMILAR MEMBER LEE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION OR SANDRA AT THE THOSE LISTENERS I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION AS A WONDER WHY CERTAIN BUSINESSES ARE POSES BILL THEY WERE NOT OPPOSED TO IN THE ASSEMBLY THEY HAVE JOINED ON LATER ON BUT I DO THINK THEY MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTANDING OUR BILL OUR BILLS ONLY PROTECTS. THE PEOPLE THERE WITHIN SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL RESTAURANTS THAT FOR REASONS WE DISCUSSED ARE HAVING PERFECT BARGAINING POSITION AND SO I'M UNSURE WHY THEY ARE BUT WE DID ENGAGE IN CALIFORNIA ASIAN CHAMBER- PACIFIC CHAMBER. EARLY ON AS WELL. HE'S SORRY THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE BILL HAS EEN MOVED BY SOME A COUPLE EURO. ALL RIGHT BENCHING OF WHICH COULD BE CLOSE YES THANK YOU SENATOR ALBUM CLOSER BRIEFLY I JUST WANT TO. CLARIFY TWO THINGS. ONE IS THAT I DO AGREE THAT BUSINESSES SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTIES AS THEY WISH. A. N. OPENTABLE RAZZIE OR ALL THESE OTHER APPS THAT EXIST OUT THERE FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. IN THIS CASE ABOUT FOURTEEN CALLS. I WILL ARGUE MOST BUSINESS PROBLEM DID NOT GET INTO BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO BE HAVE OTHER CALLS FOR IT ON ANOTHER LISTING SERVICE. IN THE CASE OF THIS BILL IS HAPPENING IS A YELP A DIFFERENT APP. WAS HAVING FORTY CALLS OF A GRUB WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP ON IT. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT PRESS SMALL RESTAURANTS FROM STILL RECEIVING ONLINE ORDERS THE GROUPON APP RIGHT FOR THE GROWTH OF BUILT IN APPLE YEP ON YELP. THAT DOES NOT PROHIBIT ANY OF THAT THING. AND I WILL SAY ALSO. WE DO NOT HEAR ABOUT THE SERVICE OF. LIKE A LIKE A CENTER. THIS THAT HAS NOT EXISTED WHEN THIS BILL WAS PROPOSED THAT DID NOT EXIST YET SO EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A WORKER SHORTAGE ARGUMENT. IF YOUR CALL FORWARDING A CALL WHETHER BE THE ACTUAL PHONE NUMBER YOU FIND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD OR YOU TO FORTY CALL IT STILL GOES TO THE SAME. PEOPLE RIGHT SO I CALLED THE GOWTH OF NUMBER AND THE SAME RESTAURANT. OWNERS THEY STILL PICK UP THE PHONE SO THERE IS NO HOPE. WORKER ARGUMENT THERE. ULTIMATELY IF GRUBHUB DOES EXPANDING CREEK THIS CALL CENTER MODEL THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN DO AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN REFINE IN THE PROCESS BUT RIGHT NOW I WOULDSAY IS. RESTAURANTS DID NOT SIGN UP TO HAVE- THIS PRACTICE OF CALL FORWARDING AND THEN PUT UNDER MARKETING SERVICES THEY DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THAT. WHAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR THE NEWS THAT. DURING THE PANDEMIC OF PEOPLE STAYED HOME. THEY WENT TO THESE COMFORTING ONLINE APPS AND MANY OF THEM ESPECIALLY ASIANS ALWAYS IN MY AREA DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM FULLY. BUT HE KNEW THEY WERE PART OF SURVIVAL. AND NOW AS WE KNOW THAT STAYING ORDERING ON APPS AND ORDERING. REMOTELY IS HERE TO STAY AND THOSE PROFITS ALSO SURGING. PEOPLE ARE STILL DECIDING RIGHT THE PROBABLY LOCAL BUSINESSES YOU'VE HEARD EVERY MOVING AWAY FROM YELP MOVING WE'VE BROUGHT UP AND THERE'S A LOT MORE OPTIONS NOW THAN I WAS A BIG MARKET SHARE BUT THIS ONLY. OTHER APPS. AND SO NEXT TIME YOU'RE ON. ON YOUR PHONE YOU PROBABLY SEE THERE'S A LOT MORE DIFFERENT APPS OUT THERE I WILL PROMOTE ALL THE APPS OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE. MORE APPS OUT THERE NOW. TO COMPETE WITH IT. BECAUSE THERE IS A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND TALKING TO HER. ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT SMALL RESTAURANTS. THEY'RE QUITE ANNOYED AT HOW HOW THEY FEEL DUPED AND CUT OUT IN THIS PROCESS WHEN THEY NEED TO SURVIVE SO. PERFECTLY AFTER I VOTE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE REST OF HIM. ALREADY THANK YOU- AND SHE COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS A- B. FORTY. FOR FOUR BY A FAMILY MEMBER AT LEAST. WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR KERRY AT ALL THE MOTION IS DO PASS. BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AMBER AMBER HI FORGES AHEAD OF. ME AT ALL I DID I SAW. THAT I THOUGHT I'D GONE SILAS. AND SILAS I HURTS BERG. HURTS BERG HI JONES. LAYERED LAYERED I STERN WHITE HOUSE SKI WHITE KASKY IGHT WINNER. THAT SEVENTY ZERO SO FAR ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL NEXT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE- WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR TO COME THE PODIUM WELCOME OUR GUESTS IN THE GALLERY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN OBSERVING YOUR LEGISLATURE IN ACTION ALL RIGHT SIMPLY MEMBER LIVING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FOUR WILL PROHIBIT EMPLOYEES OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM CONDUCTING CONTACT TRACING AND PLEASE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON DATA COLLECTED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL PROHIBITS DATA COLLECTED RECEIVER PREPARED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES FROM BEING USED TO MAINTAIN OR DISCLOSED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES. OTHER THAN FACILITATING CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DELETION OF THIS DATA WITHIN SIXTY DAYS WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS THAT SERVE A PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSE. EXCEPT FOR CONTACT TRACING REQUIRES THE SHARING OF SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING THE PERSON'S NAME PHONE NUMBER AND OTHER PERSONAL IDENTIFYING DATA WELL THIS INFORMATION WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUCCESSFULLY STOP THE SPREAD. OF THE CORONA VIRUS IN FUTURE PANDEMICS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF POTENTIALLY BEING USED FOR NON HEALTHCARE RELATED PURPOSES INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO WILLINGLY INTERACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT TO DISTRUST AND FEAR AND HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AND AFFECTED BY TWELVE IN NINETEEN CONTACT TRACING IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE FUNCTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND UTILIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CONTACT TRACE WILL CREATE DISTRUST IN CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS. AND HINDER OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS. THIS BILLIS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC CAN TRUST THEIR DATA WILL NOT BE MISUSED AND WILL ONLY BE USED FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSE. THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS MY STAFF AND I HAD ENGAGED WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO MOVING FORWARD. AFTER THIS COMMITTEE I PLAN TO WORK WITH AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A PROCESS WITH APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT FOR EXTENSIONS OF THE SIXTY DAY DATA DELETION REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC COMMUNICABLE DISEASES THAT NECESSITATE LONGER DATA RETENTION. EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FOUR WILL PROTECT THE DATA PRIVACY CALIFORNIANS AND BUILD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM NEEDED. TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM FURTHER SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE PANDEMICS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVIN AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL FOR A LONG TIME AS A SIMILAR BILL. AUTHORED BY YOU CAME TO THIS COMMITTEE- I BELIEVE WAS A YEAR AGO AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE OFFERED TODAY- ALTHOUGH ALL THE CONCERNS OF STAKEHOLDERS HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BUT I TRUST THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THEM. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE IN HIM OVER TO THE- I BELIEVE IT GOES TO THE PREPARATIONS COMMITTEE FROM HERE THAT'S TRYING TO BALANCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERESTS OF THE PRIVACY INTERESTS DIFFICULT TO DO. BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT- BY THE TIME THIS IS THE FLOOR WILL BE NO OPPOSITION HANDLE BE PEACE IN THE VALLEY SO MR SURE YOU'VE GOT MY COMMITMENT FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR NOTING THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR OVER A YEAR DURING THIS PANDEMIC- AND CONVERSATIONS- WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE ON GOING AS RECENTLY AS JUST A FEW HOURS AGO. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU- YOU HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I BELIEVE BEKAH KRAMER MILDER AND LINDA- OF. IS IT AND WHEN. SO RIGHT. IF EITHER OF YOU ON THE PHONE IF YOU WOULD IDENTIFY YOURSELVES. GOOD AFTERNOON WINDOW WAY BACK A GRAMMAR MATTER. MEMBERS SO I'M THINKING MY MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE CELL YOU CALIFORNIA ACTION AND STRONG SUPPORT EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FOUR AND THE COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO ENSURING THE APPROPRIATE PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIANS SENSITIVE INFORMATION COLLECTED AS PART OF CO THEY CONTACTED ME AFTERWARDS. WHICH I THINK HAS IS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF ANY KIND TRACING PROGRAM. IF PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INFORMATION THEY SHARE WITH CONTACT RECORDS WILL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND YEARS ARE GOING TO ATTRACT A PANDEMIC FOR LESS LIKELY TO PROVIDE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN AND WHO THEY HAD INTERACTED WITH. ANY PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE THE PANDEMIC WILL THEREFORE BE INCOMPLETE AND LACK. PRACTICE DO NOT LEAVE THIS THING. LAWS DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT FROM WAYS THAT KHAN YOU CAN OTHER PANDA REALLY IN. AND IS. HAPPENING HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HEALTH PARTNERS TO EXTRACT OUR SENSITIVE INFORMATION FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT AND POWER. FOR EXAMPLE OF EVIDENCE BY PHARMACIES USING COLOR RED BACK NEW. DATA FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING. TOM HURRIED HOME OPPONENTS CALL EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR NOT HAVE ON. EMPLOYERS REGULARLY COLLECT FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES. BENJAMIN I'M PLAYING HELLO CLIENT NUMBER. INSTEAD EIGHTY EIGHT ONE FOUR PUT LIMITS ON WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE INHERENTLY SENSITIVE AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OBTAINED AS PART OF CONTACT TRACING. SUCH AS AN EMPLOYEES MOVEMENT AND LOCATION BUT NOT ON THE JOB AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA WORK. RELATED THE ASIAN. INFORMATION SHOULD BE SHIELDED EITHER YOU. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WHEN I'M- I'VE BEEN THE PANDEMIC. AND IT IS INHERENTLY IDENTIFIABLE AND PRESIDENT. BY ENSURING APPROPRIATE COMMENTS ON.

OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LINDA GOOD AFTERNOON WENT AWAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PLEASED TO SUPPORT EIGHTY EIGHT POINT FOUR CONTRACTOR A THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN AND IT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN COMPLETE STATUS PROVIDE TRUSTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY WORKERS ARE THE BEST COLLECTORS OF THE FEEDBACK ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY OVER POLICED. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE VERY COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC ARE LESS LIKELY TO WILLINGLY ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WE HEAR REGULARLY FROM OUR PARTNERS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE W AFRAID TO SEEK HEALTH CARE ENROLL IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR OTHERWISE SEEK ASSISTANCE. SIMILARLY MANY PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE EXPERIENCED NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE EVEN WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CALL FOR HELP THE BRIDGE HERE IT'S ABOUT SLOWING THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN DO CONTACT TRACING WILL USE ONLY THOSE COMMUNITY WORKERS THAT ARE ALREADY TRUSTED FILAMENT STARTED FIRE SPREAD TO AFFECT THE CONTRACT MEETING AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL HEALTH.

OF RULE ABOUT DELETION. OF INFORMATION BUT IT ALSO SEEMS TO INDICATE YOU WERE STILL NEGOTIATING ON IT. THE ANALYSIS SORT OF CALLED OUT TO BERKELEY LOS THIS IS A PLACE THAT- YOU WOULDN'T WANT THE INFORMATION DELETED AND I JUST KNOW FROM. MY YEARS AS AN AIDS SERVICE AGENCY DIRECTOR THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING WHERE YOU WOULDN'T WANT THAT DELETED IT SIXTY DAYS I JUST WANTED TO ASK WHAT IS THE PROGRESS IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS RELATED TO THAT SIXTY DAY DELETION AND- AND WHERE ARE YOU HEADING WEST IT DOES YOU MOVED THE BILL. FOR PERSONAL THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION HIGHLIGHTING THAT ISSUE THAT THE ANALYSIS DOES NOTE AS WELL AS I THINK IMPORTANT CONCERN RAISED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'VE BEEN ONE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH VERY CLOSELY ON THIS THIS BILL HAS A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS ALREADY TO THE SIXTY DAY- PERIOD- AND YOU SEE DELIVERED US SOME LANGUAGE LOOK OUT THIS MORNING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON WHAT YOU SEE AND I THINK THAT WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO FIGURING THAT OUT- BEFORE THE BILL HEADS TO THE FLOOR. AND MISTER JEFF I CAN FOLLOW UP AND THE UC CONCERN IS IT DOESN'T MAKE. A SENSE TO DO WE WHEN THERE MIGHT BE RESEARCH DONE UP BASED ON IT IS THAT ONE OF THEIR MAJOR CONCERNS I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT- I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST LIMITED TO THAT. IN A IN A BROAD SENSE STATED HE COLLECTED SOME OF THEIR OWN DATA- WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM DATA THAT THERE MAY BE BORROWING HI I JUST KNOW WE WERE. WE WERE IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH UC SAN FRANCISCO ON A RESEARCH PROJECT WHEN I WAS DOING THAT DECADES AGO. IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA REALLY ALLOW THE POINT TO BE PROVEN ON HIV AND SO OUR VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE- I THINK IT REALLY. NEEDS SOME WORK YEAH I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T DISCOUNT YOUR CONCERN I SHARE AND I DON'T THAT THE- DID. BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE NOW AND THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE PRESENTED THIS MORNING WHICH WERE AGAIN MEETING WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU SEE. TO RESOLVE WHATEVER THOSE DISTANCES MIGHT BE IT'S NOT INSURMOUNTABLE I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND OKAY. BUT WHAT. ON MY OWN TIME MISTER CHAIR. AS I SAID I'D BE WILLING TO DO A- BOOK TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT HOW THAT ISSUE RESOLVED AS IT MOVES ALONG THANK YOU EARNINGS PREVIEW CENTER LAST YEAR. CYCLE WE ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE THE SAME- CONCERNED SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M- VERY CLEAR THAT I'LL SUPPORT IT TODAY I HAD AN INTERESTING BUT I. HEAR THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SOMEONE TO BE SUPPORTIVE HERE'S HERE'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE AND IT'S- I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH US GETTING. DATA THAT HELPS US TO DETERMINE HOW WE CAN. SLOW DOWN THE VIRUSES IT'S COMING IN THE FUTURE AND THERE WAS DATA THAT WE DID NOT COLLECT. IN DURING THAT THE PEAKER AS THIS. AS THIS VIRUS IS ROLLING OUT THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE TOLD US. WHERE WE WERE WE WOULD FIND THAT THE BIGGEST INFECTIONS- NUMBER ONE IS WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T SK PEOPLE WHERE THEY WORKED AND WHAT KIND OF WORK THEYDID- AND WE DIDN'T ASK THEM- WHAT KIND WHAT THEIR LIVING SITUATION WAS WAS WAS LIKE IN OTHER WORDS. IF WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM HOME TO QUARANTINE HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN THE SPACE AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS THE SPACE WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE. AND EARLY ON WHEN WE WERE ALL SENT HOME IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT IF THIS. WAS A TRANSMISSION TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASE THAT WAS CARRIED- IN IN THE AIR THAT TELLING PEOPLE TO GO HOME. WHEN THERE WERE TEN PEOPLE LIVING IN A THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. APARTMENT WHAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD THING AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED THE DATA BECOMES REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I DON'T. WE'RE GONNA HOLD EMPLOYERS RESPONSIBLE IF THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE GETTING SICK AND DYING BUT THEY MAY GO BACK TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND THEN IN THOSE COUNTIES WE WEREN'T ASKING YOU KNOW FOR YOU WORKING WHAT KIND OF YOU'RE WORKING IN A MEAT PACKING FACILITY OR YOU'RE WORKING IN A- SOLID FOR THIS FACILITY WITH PEOPLE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER- WITHOUT MASKS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT I THINK WE- IF WE HAD. IF WE HAD DONE THE KIND OF CONTRACT TRACING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. ITALY- UNDERSTANDABLE FROM A CONTAGIOUS CONTAGION PERSPECTIVE SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING HERE DOES NOT IMPEDE RESEARCH IF WE GO BACK AND WE START SAYING OKAY WHAT WHAT COULD WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE DATA THAT WE DID COLLECT AND- AND CAN WE KEEP IT IN. IN A- THE DATA. DISAGGREGATED IN A PUBLIC SPHERE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN DO RESEARCH SO THAT WE LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM IT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND I WANT TO SUPPORT IT SO I WILL TODAY. BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TRUCK JUST. GETTING RID OF INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE PRODUCE. PRODUCE SOME PRETTY GOOD RESULTS I THINK IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING HOW WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD YEAH I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I SHARE ALL OF YOUR CONCERNS- AND YOU KNOW ANY EXCEPTIONS. THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS WHY I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SO CLOSE TO DC TO RESOLVING VALID. ISSUES THAT THEY THEY ARE RAISING- YOU KNOW STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN KEEP DATA LONGER THAN SIXTY DAYS AND WHEN ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS HERE. WE ALSO HAVE- ABILITIES TO SHARE- WHEN YOU'VE GOT REQUESTS FOR APPROVALS FROM THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION BEING YOU SEE- ALONG WITH THEIR COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HHS SO THERE ARE. THERE ALREADY IN THE BILL WAYS TO MAKE THESE THESE THINGS WORK BUT WE WANT TO GO AND MEET YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER- BECAUSE I DO SHARE THEIR THEIR VALID CONCERNS AS WELL THIS IS. WHAT IT IS COMPLICATED BUT IT IT IS COMPLEX AND IT- IT IT IT CALLS FOR THE ATTENTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR. PARTY THANK YOU- SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU CHAIR. I'VE TAKEN A LOT OF VOTES ON PRIVACY LAW RELATED MATTERS- JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPECIALLY INJURED DISH. AND I'VE TRIED TO DO FOR THAT. BECAUSE IT REALLY IS I CAN'T ALLOW FOR THE FULL X. IN COMMODITIES A OF INFOR. ON NO CAN YOU. ALLOW THE PENDULUM TO SWING TOO FAR WHERE. ESSENTIAL INFORMATION IS NOT AT. DISPOSABLE AT THE DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALS- THAT NEEDED AND I'M I'M CONCERNED AND I VOTED FOR A NUMBER OF YOUR ITEMS BEFORE THIS ONE I'M I'M CONCERNED GOES A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS IN CONVERSATION STILL ON GOING. BUT I HAVE TO KIND OF GO BACK TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE SOMETHING NEW HAPPENS AND WE SPENT THE NEXT. SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS TRYING TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION. IN LEARN AS QUICKLY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE WHAT THIS VIRUS WAS ABOUT AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS EVEN IDENTIFIED THAT- WE HAD MAJOR FAILURES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN IT CAME TO CONTACT TRACING BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DIDN'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION AND YOU COULDN'T BY FORCE OF LAW ANOTHER MEANS PRODUCE THAT FOR SOME PRODUCE THAT. AND WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE FOLLOW THROUGH OF PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT AND CO HABITATION AND ALL THAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT SO. WE NOW HAVE A NEW VARIANT THAT IS APPARENTLY MORE CONTAGIOUS. THAN ON THE ORIGINAL THAT WAS INTRODUCED. INTO THE U. S. YEAR AND A HALF AGO. AND I JUST BEEN TRYING TO WRAP MY ARMS AROUND WHY WE WOULD BE RESTRICTING INFORMATION IF SAFEGUARDS CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE IN LEGAL MEASURES CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE THAT WOULD DISALLOW THE ABUSE AND MISUSE OF THAT INFORMATION. NOW YOUR TICKET LATE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AS BEING AN ENTITY THROUGH WHICH A LOT OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE OUR ON GOING. BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF PRIVATE RESEARCH ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE GOING TO NEED THIS. AND A LOT F THESE ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD HAVE COMPLETE ACCESS. OR MORE FREE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. MAYBE THE SEGREGATION IS THE WAY THAT HE CAN BE MAINTAINED WHILE IDENTITIES ARE PROTECTED- BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE ARE ALLOWING THE PRIVACY ARGUMENT. TO OVERWHELM US WHEN WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC WITH THE NEW VARIANT ON THE STAGE. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE CONCERNS SO FOR EXAMPLE VACCINATION STATUS. NOW IS THAT CAN YOU CAN YOU ARTICULATE OR CONFIRM THAT VACCINATION STATUS IS A PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WILL. B. DEEMS RECOVERABLE OR WOULD THAT NEED TO BE DELETED. IN THE SIXTY DAYS AS WELL. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER WERE JUST THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT VACCINES THERE IS NOT THE WORD VACCINE IN THE BILL. SORT OF BORED JUST AS THAT RESPOND YOUR QUESTION I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT CERTAIN IT DOES- IN TERMS OF. WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE STATUS AS HAVING BEEN SICK OR NOT. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC OR THROUGH ANY OTHER. ACTUATION IS THEIR STATUS CONSIDER PROTECTED PRIVACY MATTERS OR WOULD THAT BE MAINTAINED IN. THE EXAM TWO CATEGORIES. SOME I'M NOT. I'M NOT SURE IF- YOU KNOW IT IF WE JUST GO BACK TO WHAT THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IT'S PROHIBITING EMPLOYEES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM CONDUCTING CONTACT TRACING AND IT ALSO PROHIBITS THAT DATA THAT IS COLLECTED- AND RECEIVED HER PREPARED FOR CONTACT TRICKS TREATING PURPOSES FROM BEING USED OR DISCLOSED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THEN CONTACT TRACING ITSELF IT DOES OF COURSE HAVE THE EXEMPTIONS FOR THE RESEARCH WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- SO IT'S INFORMATION COLLECTED IN CONTACT TRACING- SAID I DON'T I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW FROM A PEOPLE POWER PERSPECTIVE WHICH I THINK WE ALL WERE VERY CONCERNED EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC IF WE'RE DOING A CONTACT PERSON THAT WE NEEDED TO DO- IF THERE IS A UNIFORM WAY. THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING ACROSS COUNTIES- SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED. OKAY NOW I'M EVEN MORE CONFUSED. SO THE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED BUT THERE'S AN EXCLUSIONARY PROCESS. A. B. U. I THIS BILL RIGHT. AND IT'S WHATEVER INFORMATION IS COLLECTED IN CONTACT TRACING SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW IN THE COUNTY THAT YEAR AND WHAT WHAT THEY'RE COLLECTING RIGHT SO YOU'RE ASKING YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT SPECIFIC DATA POINTS. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONTACT TRACING DATA SO WHATEVER IS BEING CONDUCTED IN A TRACING. SO IMAGINE. PERSON ACTS WAS DEEMED TO TEST POSITIVE. IT THROUGH CONTACT TRACING IDENTIFIED THAT PERSON X. HAD A RESTAURANT. OUR ENGAGEMENT THE DAY BEFORE LIVES WITH THREE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS SO ON THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF A NETWORK OF INFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO CORRECT. BECAUSE THE PATHOLOGY IN BEHAVIOR HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN VIRUS PATHOLOGY ARE THINGS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO ENTER THROUGH CONTACT TRACING THAT'S WHY ACADEMICS AND SCIENTISTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. DO THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST TO ASSEMBLE THIS INFORMATION IN THE ANALYTICS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT TO PRODUCE A REPORT THAT IDENTIFIES TRENDS. THAT ALLOW US TO PREVENT SIMILAR OUTBREAKS IN THE FUTURE OR SIMILAR ENGAGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. SO EXACTLY IS YOUR QUESTION. WELL THE FIRST QUESTION IS VACCINATION STATUS CONSIDERED- HE ADDED THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND PRESERVED OR DELETED IN SIXTY DAYS YES AS I MENTIONED THAT VACCINES ARE MENTIONED IN THE BILL BUT TO YOUR BROADER QUESTION LOCAL AND STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN KEEP THE DATA LONGER THAN SIXTY DAYS HELLO THAT IS NOT ALREADY AN EXCEPTION IN THE BILL. HOW LONG CAN THEY KEEP IT. SO THE SIXTY DAY NUMBER IS WHAT'S IN THE BILL NOT MUCH LONGER SO I CAN'T I CAN'T MAKE THAT DECISION FOR YOU OR I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THAT NUMBER IS THAT THEY'LL DETERMINE THAT THEY NEED IT FOR LOOK LET ME LET ME LET ME INTERJECT HERE PADDLING SECOND AS MUCH FUN AS THIS IS HALF OF IT IN TERMS OF CONTACT TRACING CONTACT TRACING- CENTER BOARD IS IF YOU'VE BEEN CONTACTED BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN IN PROXIMITY TO SOMEONE WHO- TEST POSITIVE FOR IT AS YOU MAY KNOW THEY ASK. ABOUT THAT THE CONTACT THAT RELATIONSHIP SHOULD TECH TRACING SO FAR AS I KNOW DOES NOT INVOLVE INQUIRY AS TO VACCINATION STATUS EITHER WHETHER ONE'S BEEN VACCINATED HOW MANY TIMES ONCE VACCINATED OR NOT VACCINATED OR REASONS WHY SO THAT DATA WOULD NOT BE IN THE SIMPLY MEMBER LIVING YOU CAN CORRECT ME THAT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE COLLECTED IN CONNECTION WITH CONTACT TRACING SO SOME REMEMBER LEVIN CARE TO COMMENT ON MY COMMENTS. NO WE'RE GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS OR HINDERS THE INQUIRY CENTER MORICHES SURGEON JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN INDIVIDUALS WERE REACHING OUT- ORAS THEY HAVE FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS- ARE YOU SAYING THAT NOT. DURING THE CONTACT TRACING PROCESS THEY DON'T INQUIRE INTO AN INDIVIDUAL'S VACCINATION STATUS. I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON CONTACT TRACING BUT THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE YES OKAY THE ASSOCIATION MODELING THAT GOES IN THE CONTACT TRACING IDENTIFIES TILL THERE'S A CONTAINMENT- RATIO WHERE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED. UP A CIRCLE OF INTERACTION. NOW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD BEEN VACCINATED BUT STILL EITHER TESTED POSITIVE OR- EXHIBITED SYMPTOMS. THE ENTIRE NOTION OF CONTACT TRACING IS TO INVESTIGATE THE BREATH IN THE EXPERT EXPOSURE- THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE GONE THROUGH. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- TRACY CONTACT TRACING INFORMATION HE CAN INCLUDE. A WHILE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT ASSORTMENT OF INFORMATION THAT COULD BE TERRIBLY HELPFUL. FOR RESEARCH AND ACADEMICS AND OTHERS IN OTHER. I MEAN MY MISSING SOMETHING HERE. I MEAN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SENATOR'S ENTHUSIASM I NOTED ON THAT ISSUE SO UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE LOSING SOME COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BUDGET WHICH WILL THEY WILL RETURN A NUMBER ONE POINT NUMBER ONE POINT NUMBER TWO IS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE IF YOU CARE TO RESPOND TO THAT EITHER NOW OR IN THE CLOTHES WE WOULD WELCOME THAT- IT AS TO. WHETHER OR NOT- THE METHODOLOGY FOR CONTACT TRACING EITHER DOES OR DOES NOT INCLUDE VACCINATION STATUS PRESS YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT AND IF IT DOES INCLUDE VACCINATION STATUS WHAT IS THE IMPACT UPON THAT BASED ON YOUR BILL. FOR ALL HELL IN MY CLOTHES THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- YES SINISTER. THANK YOU. I THINK WE'VE WE'VE TALKED THIS WENT THROUGH AND I APPRECIATE HIS FAMILY MEMBERS- RESPONSES THUS FAR ESPECIALLY TO THE COMMITMENTS IN THE GOOD FAITH WORK GOING ON WITH YOU SEE AMONGST MY COLLEAGUES OF THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE I MAY NOT BE I I'VE READ THROUGH THE ANNOUNCES A FEW TIMES. AND THE BILL WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS BEYOND THE SORT OF RECORD RETENTION ISSUE THAT WE KNOW YOU'RE- TRYING TO WORK ON AND SETTLE. AM I MISREADING THE BILL. TO SAVE IT YOU SEE OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR YOUR CS YOU. COULD NOT CONDUCT CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING UNLESS IT WAS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES OR IS THAT NOT. NO THAT'S NOT IT NOT THAT NOT ENOUGH SO EVEN THOUGH THE DEFINITION OF LAUNCH HI I MISS READING AT THAT SO THE DEFINITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CAN ONLY CONDUCT CONTACT RACING. FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AT THE SAME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE SEE AS HUMAN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE UNDER THAT DEFINITION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WE'RE STILL GOING TO LET THEM. DO CONTACT TRACING ON THEIR CAMPUS BUT THEY CAN'T HAVE LIKE A- CAMPUS POLICE BE THE ONE TO VISIT IS THAT SORT OF THING YEAH EXACTLY. OKAY SO THEY CAN STILL CONDUCT THE CONTACT TRACING EVEN IF IT'S NOT JUST THEIR EMPLOYEES EVEN IF IT'S- STUDENTS OWNER KNOWS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WOULD NOT YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. ONE PERSON OFFICE COULD NOT BUT- YOU SEEN BEFORE EMPLOYEE EARLY. AND THEN HAVE SOMEONE ELSE VISIT THAT DORM ROOM OR WHEREVER IT IS. ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS IT WAS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. DOING THAT INTERFACING OKAY GREAT. THANKS FOR THAT UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEASURE OF ITS PROPERTY THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU SEEING SEEING NONE- I'M SORRY SIR WINNER. THANK YOU THANK YOU- MR CHECK MISTER CHAIRMAN I SPOKE TO THE AUTHOR ON ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY I SUPPORT THIS BILL- AND I APOLOGIZE I WAS OUT TO SENDING A BILL SO THIS CAME UP ALREADY WHILE I WAS PRESENTING APOLOGIZE. ON THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE BILL HAS AN EXEMPTION FOR OUR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH- AND THAT I DO. BELIEVE THAT- THAT YOU SEE SHOULD HAVE- IT'S NOT THE SAME IN SIMILAR OR SOME SORT OF GUARD RAIL- EXEMPTION. BECAUSE YOU SEE A AND THEN WE SAW THIS IN THIS KIND OF AMERICAN SOME WAYS FUNCTIONS. LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT A LOT OF WAYS AND WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF HIS BASIC. PUBLIC HEALTH WORK HAPPENING AT OUR UC CAMPUSES ARE LITTLE DIFFERENT VERY DIFFERENT THAN A- PRIVATE ENTITY WHERE I COMPLETELY I. UNDERSTAND THE PRIVACY CONCERNS AND SO I WILL I'M GLAD AND I AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE YOU SEE I DON'T THINK IT'S A BROAD. MAJOR AMENDMENT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A VERY NARROW EXEMPTIONS THAT YOU SEE WHEN IT'S- CAN RETAIN THIS DATA. FOR RESEARCH AND DATA. DISAGGREGATED DATA COLLECTION PURPOSES WITHOUT HAVING TO GET IT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- AND YOU KNOW I GOT I COME OUT TO US. FROM THE WORK WE'VE DONE DURING THE PANDEMIC WHICH REALLY SHOWED SOME OF THE REAL DEFICIENCIES. ON OUR DATA COLLECTION- SPECIFICALLY WE ARE WORKING ON THEIR PROFOUND LACK OF LGBTQ. DATA COLLECTION AROUND KOBE BUT IT'S A BROADER THAN THAT WE JUST DON'T DO A GREAT JOB. AND THE LGBTQ CONTACTS WE LEARNED AFTER THE FACT. THAT THE CDPH AFFECTED WE WAS REALLY ONLY COLLECTING CONTACT TRACING RELATED. DATA WHICH IS. PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE ACTUAL TESTING DATA BUT AT LEAST IT WAS SOMETHING- AND SO THAT THE CONTEXT RAISING DATA WHEN IT'S DISAGGREGATED SO IT'S NOT VIOLATE ANYONE'S PRIVACY. CAN BE QUITE VALUABLE AND I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO JUST DELETE THAT AND- AND SO THAT'S WHY I% DO THINK INCLUDING YOU SEE WOULD BE A GOOD THING SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR'S CONTINUING WORK. OR THANK YOU SIR- OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS COMMENTS SAYING NONE- I BELIEVE SENATOR STERN HAS MOVED THE BILL.

POSTED MAR HOW THE AMOUNT OF REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO CANNABIS RETAILERS ONLINE ON THE LONG BEACHCOLLECTIVE PERSECUTION BOTH IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS AND NEXT TO THE TO LINE TO FIFTY. PLEASE GO AHEAD. SURE ARMSTRONG OF THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COALITION WE STAND IN THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. ALL RIGHT LET'S TURNED OPPOSITION I SEE- TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES LISTEN OPPOSITION MR GLAND BACCHUS AND MISS KATHY SCHEER. MR BACCHUS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. MR KERRY COMMITTEE GOING BACK AS A DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. THANK YOU FOR HEARING OUR OPPOSITION TO THE DIMMER CAN I- DON'T OPULATED NOT PROFIT FROM THE SALE OF CANNABIS WE WORK FOR THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. THE STOCK CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING ARRESTED INCARCERATED. ANOTHER USE FOR GROWING SMALL AMOUNTS OF CANNABIS. WE ALSO WANTED TO FUND DRUG TREATMENT HARM REDUCTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND TO REINVEST IN COMMUNITIES THAT THEN DEVASTATED BY THE DRUG WAR AND MASS INCARCERATION. I THINK WE SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED BILL TO BRING ON MORE EQUITY LICENSES. FOR EQUITY LICENSEES AND LEGISLATION TO ASSIST STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND BRINGING ON MORE EQUITY LICENSES AND OTHER TYPES OF LICENSES. WE DON'T WEIGH IN ALMOST A REGULATORY BILLS. HOWEVER WE PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. CURRENT LAW ALREADY PUNISHES THE UNLAWFUL SINGLE CAMPUS. WITH UP TO SIX MONTHS IN JAIL PERFECT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE SAME PROSECUTOR COULD THREATEN LOCAL CONVICTIONS THAT RESULTED IN CONSERVATION AND TO THREATEN MASSIVE CIVIL PENALTIES AS WELL BASED ON SAMETIME SHOCKS. PREHISTORICAL PLEA BARGAIN THE DEFENDANT MIGHT HAVE TO ACCEPT IT ON JUST JAIL SENTENCE. AVOID CRIPPLING GAP OR ALTERNATELY EXCEPT CRIPPLING DEBT TO AVOID THE DANGERS OF COUNTY JAIL. SCREAMING IN FACT BE PUNISHED WITH BULLS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE ELECTED TO GIVE THIS POWER THE PROSECUTORS AND COURTS. PROSECUTORS SHOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO CHOOSE CRIMINAL OR CIVIL BUT NOT BOTH THIS THIS BILL GIBSON BUT- WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROVISION ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE COST OF ENFORCING THE LAW. WE BELIEVE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE FUNDED FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUDGETS. NOT FROM FINES LEVIED BY THE SAME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. WE KNOW FROM HISTORY ABOUT THE FORFEITURE THAT WHEN AN AGENCY MAY LEGALLY PROFIT FROM THE TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. THAT SOME AGENCIES NOT ALL BUT SOME WILL INEVITABLY DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER EFFORTS THE ONE THAT PAYS FOR ITSELF AND PERHAPS PROVIDE A LITTLE EXTRA TO BE ABLE TO COME. THIS IS A MISTAKE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT INCENTIVIZING PROSECUTIONS IN THIS WAY AND BY ADDING HIGH CIVIL PENALTIES ON TOP OF CRIMINAL PENALTIES. IT'S GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE LEGAL STORES. OR OTHER CANNABIS ACTIVITIES AND WATCH AS WELL AS ANY PLACE ELSE. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL OKAY MAYBE YEARS TO PUNISH. LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THE HISTORY OF EVERY PENALTY IN THE CONTEXT OF MARIJUANA OR OTHER DRUGS. NO MATTER WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THAT'S HOW IT GOES WE DO KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MARGUS MISCAVIGE HERE. YES GOOD EVENING KATHY SHARED RADIO YOU CALIFORNIA ACTIONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON OUR CONCERNS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE SET OUT. THE ANALYSIS. SO THE MEMBERS ARE AN ENORMOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WILL HELP TO KEEP THE LAW FROM BEING USED TO TARGET THE LOW LEVEL. LOW INCOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE LITTLE CONTROL OVER THE ILLEGAL OPERATION RUN BY THEIR EMPLOYER. HOWEVER WE HAVE REMAINING CONCERNS AND MUST REMAIN IN OPPOSITION. I JOINED IN THE COMMENTS OF MR BACK INSIDE TO THE DANGERS OF ALLOWING. THE SAME AGENCY THIS BECAUSE SEVERAL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL. SECONDLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE THE AG COUNTY COUNCIL CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CITY PROSECUTORS WILL BE ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED FROM THE FINES GENERATED BUT THIS WILL GIVE THEM AN IMPROPER INCENTIVE. TO USE THE PROSECUTION OF THE CASE BECAUSE THE GENERATE REVENUE FOR THEIR OFFICE. WE REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT THE ONEROUS PENALTIES PERMITTED IN THE CELL WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNLICENSED ESTABLISHMENTS OPERATING IN THE STATE. INSTEAD WE FEAR THAT THOSE WHO WILL BE HURT MOST OF THE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME PLACES. AT WHICH- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK COLONEL. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SAYING NO ONE OF THE GALLERY NO ONE ROOM ONE TWELVE ONE TWELVE. ON THE PHONE LINE DOES AN OPPOSITION MATER IF YOU PLEASE QUEUE THEM UP. IF YOU LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AT THE TIME. WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. SORRY THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE FLOOR US AND A COUPLE EURO. THANK YOU MR CHAIR- I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS IS- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS BELL- I THINK THE AMENDMENTS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. THAT THAT THAT THAT I THINK- I THINK THEY REALLY RESOLVE IT AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- BYE BYE ADDING THAT THE PERSON HAS TO BE AN OWNER OFFICER OR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER. IN AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS AS TO WHETHER THEY- THEY HAD A AND A COMMAND OR CONTROL DECISION- I THINK WE SHOULD RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT WERE RAISED IN REGARDS TO HOW IT GETS USED IN AND INTERPRETED UP OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AND- QUITE FRANKLY PART OF THE- CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. IN LEGALIZING CANNABIS IS WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO STOP THE ILLEGAL TRADE IN THE IN THE STATE SO IF THE ILLEGAL TRADE IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND CHEAP. THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE WILL GO INSTEAD OF THE LEGAL TRADE AND SO ON THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO PUT TO PUT TEETH IN THE LAW SO THAT WE CAN. START TO DRIVE THE ILLEGAL TRADE OUT OF THE STATE AND INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S STATE- THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE AND LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO THE COVER GIRL SENATOR CHARLES. YEAH THANK YOU- I TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUES AS MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER CAPITAL HAD JUST MENTIONED ABOUT- INSURING THAT WERE REALLY GOING AFTER THE BIGGER GUYS AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS AND FOR WORKING. ON THIS BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY BIG ISSUE- YOU KNOW I STILL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY MAYBE WHEN I'M ADDING YOUR CLOSING REMARKS BUT- I STILL HAD ISSUES WITH THE- OPPOSITION I MEAN IN THE GLOBAL CONTACTS AND I DON'T THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT BUT IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT I KNOW. THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE WITH CONTINUING TO- CRIMINALIZE- THIS SPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR MARIJUANA- AND THAT'S NOT. WHAT TRYING TO TACKLE HERE THIS IS NOT YOUR INTENTION WHATSOEVER. BUT I GET YOU KNOW WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IN THAT SENSE SO- OF COURSE WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I JUST THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD BUT I. APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOUR MANAGER IN THE CHORUS BRITAIN'S SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I REALLY- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE CLEAR WE'RE GOING AFTER THE- THE RINGLEADERS NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. LOOKING AT A LOWER LEVEL IN THE ORGANIZATION ARE CAUGHT UP IN IT I DO. NOT SEE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION- IN TERMS OF NOT REALLY. ATTENDING PEOPLE'S LIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN. AN ILLEGAL OPERATION I THINK IS A MAN IN SCHOOL A LONG WAY. TO ADDRESSING THAT. YOUR BIG PICTURE HERE. WE HAVE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. THEY'RE SPENDING. A LOT OF MONEY. AND IBM THIS IS SOMETHING I SAY THIS AS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT WHO. YOU KNOW BUT FOR A LOT OF TAXES AND REGULATIONS. WE HAVE SO HEAVILY REGULATED AND- IMPOSE VERY HIGH TAXES ON THIS. INDUSTRY THAT IT HELPS IN SOME WAYS FUEL AN ILLICIT MARKET- AND APART FROM THE TAXES THAT THEY'RE PAYING I THINK IT'S- BETWEEN THE CULTIVATION AND USE TAXES LIKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. PLUS ANY LOCAL TAXES. BEST OF ALL SORTS OF SECURITY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. AND FOR THE BIG OPERATORS THEY CAN ABSORB THAT. BUT FOR THE ESPECIALLY THE SMALL LOCAL OPERATORS WITH A LOT OF THEM IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LONG BEACH IN OTHER AREAS TOO AS WELL. THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND- WE HAVE AN EQUITY PROGRAM SO WE HAVE A LOT OF. FOLKS WE'VE- IT'S BEEN GREAT TO GET INTO. WHO WHO SUFFERED THE MOST DURING THE PROHIBITION. ON CANNABIS SOME. ME IN NOW AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN- PARTAKE IN THE LEGAL BUSINESS- AND IT'S REALLY UNFAIR. WHEN THEY ARE BEING UNDERMINED. BY THESE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO DEAL. WITH SOME OF THE- REGULATORY AND TAX STRUCTURES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOCAL LAND USE STRUCTURES THAT. EFFECTIVELY BANNED THESE BUSINESSES AND MOST OF CALIFORNIA- BUT THIS IS ONE APPROACH AND SOME HAPPY. TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR WE ARE OTHER COMMENTS- THE LAYERED AND SENT AWAY CAL SKI. THANK YOU MR. FROM THE I REALLY APPRECIATE SENATOR WIENER'S COMMENTS AND I WANT TO ADD ONE THING AND THE- THERE IS AN ISSUE GOING ON ARE WE AS A LEGISLATURE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO EXTEND THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES ARE LOCKED AT SUNSET. AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN COUNTY STATE CAN'T PROCESS ANY OF THE PERMITS IN ANY EXPEDITED WAY. AND WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF KICKING PEOPLE OUT WHEN WE NEED TO GET THE MAN AND WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE BLACK MARKET AND THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN POINT. WHICH IS MONTEREY COUNTY WHICH SENATOR CAFIERO AND I SHARE. AND THERE WAS A OF SUPERVISORS THAT YOU COULD ONLY DO THE GROSS AND GREENHOUSES AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE- LEGACY FARMERS IN BIG SUR THAT'VE BEEN THERE FOREVER. THEY DON'T HAVE GREENHOUSES THEY CAN'T COME IN AND THEY'VE JUST MODERATED THIS REQUIREMENT IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR LICENSE BUT- IF WE SUNSET THE PROVISIONAL IT MIGHT SUNSET THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO COME IN TO THE LEGAL POINTS THAT WE WANT THEM ALL TO BE. BANNED SO ENORMOUS SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ITIS THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THE REAL QUESTION IS. IS DO IT PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BE LEGAL AS OPPOSED OTHERWISE I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF WE DON'T DO OTHER THINGS WERE PUSHING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND THEN PICKING UP IN FORT SMITH SO- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT THERE ARE. THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WITH LOTS OF MOVING PARTS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SAID EARLIER SO MY CASKET A MYSTERY BOOK QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION EITHER MR BACCHUS SERMONS HERE BECAUSE- OF ONE THAT COULD WIN THE OBJECTIONS WAS. THAT IF YOU HAVE TO D. A. GOING AFTER THE CIVIL PENALTIES N. AT LEAST FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA BECAUSE HE COULD. PRESSURE PEOPLE INTO TAKING A COP INTO THIS THREE HUNDRED OR THIRTY THOUSAND. A DOLLAR PENALTY BUT NOW THAT'S THAT'S REMOVED WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND YOU HAVE. COUNTY COUNCIL AND BIG CITY- CITY ATTORNEYS SO DOESN'T THAT ALLEVIATE THE CONCERNS ITSELF RIGHT IN. THEIR OPPOSITION. LET ME POSE THE QUESTION WITH A QUESTION POSED THE OPPOSITION MR BACCHUS OR MACHINE- ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I DEFINITELY CARE WE CAN CLIMB BACK IN THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE COUNTY. THE BILL- DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO BE ABLE TO BRING MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AND CIVIL CHARGES IT PROVIDES FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY. IN LOS ANGELES SATURDAY. LET'S JUST GO IN THE AREA AND THEY PROSECUTE MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING THE POSSESSION SALE OR POSSESSION FOR SALES CANNABIS. AND PENALTY IS SIX MONTHS IN JAIL. THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE FOR EACH. AVERAGE CONNECTION. YOU COULD MAKE A CHARGE MULTIPLE CHARGES FOR MISDEMEANOR SALE AND PURSUE THE CIVIL C. AS WELL SO THAT THE EXAMPLE OF AGENCY GIVEN THAT POWER BUT NOT THE DISTRIBUTARIES OFFICE. I GUESS THE PROBLEM WAS HE SAID IF YOU ORIGINALLY THE BILL GAVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THAT POWER SO THEN I'M I'VE GOT YOU IN COURT I'M PROSECUTING YOU. EMILY AND IT IT SEEMS LIKE THESE ONEROUS FINES WAS AN OVER REACHING BY SEPARATING THEM. AND GIVING A DIFFERENT ATTORNEY AN ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEY OF SAN JOSE'S THEN OF THE BIG REPUTATION ABOUT GOING AFTER PEOPLE BUT MAYBE IT COULD HAPPEN THIS N. THAT. LESSEN SOME OF THIS- THE AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITY SET UP CONCERN OF. FULL OF COLOR THAT MAY BE PROSECUTOR MAYBE PUT IN A BAD SITUATION WHEN THE WHEN THE DA'S GOT THEM ON A CRIMINAL CHARGE. MR BACCHUS SECURE RESPOND. ZURCHER YES GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR OWN BERG. B. I'M GOING TO TAKE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY LIMITED THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES THAT COULD BRING SIMULTANEOUS CIVIL AND CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT. THE BILL STILL WILL PROVIDE WITH AMENDMENTS THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY FROM THE FOUR LARGEST CITIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PERSON ALL CIVIL PENALTIES AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. THE AMENDMENTS ARE PART HELPFUL- THERE MAY BE CONCERN THAT ACTUALLY FOR CAPITAL THERE ARE MORE. LIKE CALIFORNIA FOR CITIES ARE MENTIONED- AND GIVEN HIS POWER IT'S JUST THAT. BUT THE BILL DOESN'T HAVE THE ELEMENTS THAT WILL CREATE MORE LICENSED STORES INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT MECHANISM AGAINST ONLINE CONSTRUCTED STATION DOESN'T DEFINE HOW SMALLER OPERATION MIGHT BE THERE'S STILL A DANGER THAT THIS FINDING STUDENTS CAN'T IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED AT ALL GOOD PENALTIES HAVE BEEN. TO PUNISH LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. MR HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE OPPOSITION IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE AMENDMENT ANOTHER AMENDMENT TO SORT OF FOCUS ON THE OWNER THE OFFICERS THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS. TAKES AWAY THESE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE AN EQUITY STAKE JUST A LOW LEVEL. M. EMPLOYEES AND I GUESS MY CONCERN WITH THE OPPOSITION CONTINUING ON WITH THAT IS THAT THIS AIDING AND ABETTING. ONE OF THE FACTORS ARE OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVEN OF OUR STAFF REPORTS TALKS ABOUT PROVIDING SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE OR ENCOURAGEMENT. ARE THEY CONCERNED THAT- OF JUST A REGULAR EMPLOYEE COULD BE FIRED BY THE FACT THAT THEY'RE- WORKING IS THAT. MEET THAT THRESHOLD FOR ENCOURAGEMENT% THAT WOULD WOULD CATCH HIM UNDER THE NETWORK. IT SEEMS THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO SEPARATE THE BIG CHEESE FROM THE SMALL SMALL CHEESE- IS THAT A CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION. MR BACCHUS. YOUR ACCOUNT PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION B. COMMENT HAVE NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IF YOU'RE MANAGING A STORE WITH TWENTY EMPLOYEES IT WOULDN'T CAPTURE THE PERSON WORKING THE COUNTER FOR THE PERSON- PUSHING A BROOM OR WHAT SECURITY HOWEVER HERE IN BEIJING A STOREFRONT ACCOUNTS TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WHO IS THE OWNER THE OPERATOR. OF THE SHAREHOLDERS THE PERSON WITH THE WITH THE FINANCIAL INTEREST THERE ARE DEFINITIONS THAT WILL PROTECT SMALL DRIVES. ARE BEING CAUGHT UP IN. SIX OF THE TO PEOPLE FOR. CAROUSEL OUR GOAL IS TO SEE MORE LEGAL STORES OPEN SO THAT THE CONSUMERS AND GO WHERE THAT. PRODUCT IS SAFE CONVENIENT. AND COMPETITIVELY PRICED THEM STILL DOESN'T GET TO THAT GOAL IT ONLY SEEKS TO CREATE A CUDDLE AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ALSO REIMBURSING AND CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR AGENCIES TO GO AFTER SUPPORTERS. ORDINAL ROSE FROM UNDERSTANDING THE FOURTH FACTOR THAT'S SUPPOSED TO CONSIDER IS WHETHER THE PERSON'S CONTACT WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN FURTHERING THE UNLICENSED CANNABIS SECTOR ACTIVITY SO THEN IF YOU HAVE A REALLY SMALL. FOR PERSON OPERATION AND TWO OF THEM ARE JUST REGULAR EMPLOYEES. VERSUS A TWENTY FIVE PERSON OPERATION AND TWENTY THREE PEOPLE ARE JUST REGULAR EMPLOYEES. IS THE IS THE CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THAT THAT MAY GET THE CITY ATTORNEY- EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE VERY HALF OF THE EMPLOYEES SAID THEY WOULD BECOME. THEY WOULD SIGNIFICANT FURTHER THE ON LICENSING- CANVAS ACTIVITY VERSUS THE PERSON WORKS FOR A BIGGER FIRM WOULDN'T BE. CAPTURED IS TAT BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S CORRECTABLE LIGHTING. IT'S THE I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THE WHAT THE THIRD. YES MISS PARKER'S RESPONSE. DON'T OF THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO AND ANY ACTIVE SHOOTER OKAY SO YOU AS WELL. THERE'S NO DEFINITION THE BILL ON THE SIDE THE OPERATION ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADERS. SO I THINK A LOT OF GOING DOWN TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY ARE ARE WORKING IN A STORE THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW WHICH PHONE LICENSE BUT THEY'RE STILL- WHICH ROOM FOR. FORD BECAUSE WE'LL BE USING EXACTLY THE POINT OF THE BUILDERS TO INCENTIVIZE MORE. PUNISHMENT INCENTIVIZE MORE ENFORCEMENT BY MAKING THE FLYING SIZEABLE AND PROVIDING FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE- THAT BRINGS THE ACTION. SO THAT IS THE PURPOSE IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IT WILL GET EVEN SMALL OPERATORS ARE SMALL- LOW INCOME PEOPLE COLOR MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT CANNOT BE EDUCATED AND IT'S NOT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE GOAL BUT THE BILL IS WRITTEN HOUSE ADDRESS. I'M SORRY THANK YOU SEMI KELSEY'S AT RESPOND YOUR QUESTIONS YEAH I'M RIGHT. MR I'M STILL A LITTLE NERVOUS I THINK I'M GOING TO. FIVE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I AM I WAS IN. A SORT OF HANG ON THAT ARE ON THE FENCE BUT I THINK- I'LL DO SOME MORE STUDY OF THIS BUT I THINK THEY'LL GIVE THE AUTHOR. A CHANCE TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT LEVEL. ALL RIGHT. OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS OF WAS OUR MOTION IS THERE A MOTION MOVED BY SENATOR CAFIERO DO YOU CARE TO CLOSE- IN BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE SEVEN MEMBER RUBIO- YOU HAVE BEEN- QUITE DILIGENT IN. YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS BILL AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS CAN SEE YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY OF THE BILLS COME A LONG WAY SINCE IT FIRST ARRIVED THIS COMMITTEE. AND I THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE BILL AS WELL AS TO YOUR- FLEXIBILITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE CONCERNS OF VARIOUS STAKE HOLDERS ALL RIGHT YOU CAN CLOSE THANK YOU KNOW I JUST APPRECIATE THE COMMENT FROM THE CONVERSATION. AND THE JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THE INTENT OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE AND I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY AGENCIES I GOT CALLS FROM. OUR STORE THAT SAID HE HELP US GET MORE MORE LICENSES AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT A- I GOT SEPARATED- BILL OR A PACKAGE OF BILLS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITHIN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND THE- THE LACK OF. LICENSES FOR FOLKS THAT ARE WILLING TO DO THE RIGHT THING- IS NOT AVAILABLE AND I WISH WE COULD ADDRESS THAT WITH THIS BUT WE CAN'T HELP WITH THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAD THE MAJOR CONCERN WAS THAT. SOME OF THIS ILLEGAL OF FACILITIES ARE PROVIDING TO THE SAME BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE THEY'RE PROVIDING CANNABIS THAT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED BY THE STATE. THEREFORE PUTTING HIM IN DANGER OF YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT IS IN THOSE- WHEN THEY SELL THOUGH THAT THAT TOP PRODUCT. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE CALL CERN'S FROM. FROM THE OPPOSITION. BUT THAT'S WHY I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNEW THAT MY INTENT IS NOT TO PENALIZE BUT TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS AND ALSO. DO THE MAKE MOVE TO THE BUT TO MOVE FORWARD AND REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF MORE LICENSES. AND EQUITY WITHIN THOSE LICENSES SO AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR. FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION IS. YOU KNOW I CAN I'VE DONE ALL THAT I COULD- TO MAKE SURE THAT I ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THE COMMITTEE. AND TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IS FAR FROM THE OPPOSITION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. THAT I'M NOT GETTING NO MATTER WHAT I DO- THE FACT IS THAT THE BILL IS NOT WHAT THE WHAT THE OPPOSITION WANTS AND I APPRECIATE. THEIR ADVOCACY BUT AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. REALLY BEING HURT BYE BYE THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND I.

SENT TODAY- THANK YOU SSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AND I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BILL THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT FAIR AND MEASURED- TAKING MA'AM IT'S BOTH FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND IN THE COMMITTED TODAY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIA-BANKERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. THEY ARE STILL BOTH IN OPPOSITION BUT I KNOW YOU WORKED DILIGENTLY TO SEE IF YOU CAN'T RESOLVE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AT LEAST. AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONVERSATIONS ARE CONTINUING I SUPPOSE I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT AND THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS YES WE ARE IN FACT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT I'M ACCEPTING TODAY THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE- THE GOOD ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. ARE IN FURTHERANCE OF TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ISSUES. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF THIS IS ONLY. FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL STUDENT LOANS. MOST THESE. THESE WHO TAKE THESE LONG IN THEN IF THEY HAVE RUN INTO. WITH THE LOAN. WE'LL GET A NOTICE OR MAY EVEN A CASE AGAINST HIM IN COURT. N. OR MOSTLY. NOT EVEN REPRESENT BY pKEN. AND WHAT HAVE IS THEY'LL MISS. OR NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO COURT DOCUMENTS. IN THE SERVICES OF THESE LOANS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND IT'S LIKE A- LIKE A MIDDLE OF THE DAY JUST RUN THROUGH THESE LAWSUITS. THAT'S A LOT OF DEFAULT JUDGMENTS THAT GET ENTERED IN AND ONE THAT IT FILTERS AND GET CENTERED. AND DEFECTS IN WHAT LED TO THAT JUDGMENT OR NOT EXPLORE UNLESS AN ATTORNEY IS HIRED AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESS TO GO THROUGH SO ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL REALLY. IS INCREASING THE EVIDENTIARY STANDARD SO THAT IN THESE CASES ARE PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS IF THEY WANT TO BRING A CASE AGAINST. A BAR WHERE THEY HAVE TO PROVE AND SHOW THAT THEY OWN THE LOAN. THAT THEY PROVIDE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTATION. TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT FOR THE QUARTER BEFORE THE COURT ENTERS A FULL TOUCH MEANT. THAT IT IS THE PROPER. ACTION AND WHAT SOME OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS HAVE FOUND. WHEN SOMEBODY COMES TO THEM AND SAYS I'M IN REAL TROUBLE NOW. AND I NEED YOUR HELP IS THEY WILL FIND SIGNIFICANT DEFECTS IN THE ORIGINAL FILINGS. AND OFTENTIMES THE SERVICER OR THE PARTY WITH A DEFAULT JUDGMENT CAN'T EVEN ESTABLISH THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. TO GET THAT DEFAULT JUDGMENT THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE THE LAW. THESE ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES ALL WE'RE DOING. IS ENSURING THAT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTATION AND EVIDENCE BEING BROUGHT TO THE COURT. IF THAT KIND OF A PROCESS IS GOING TO BE ENTERED INTO. THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COLLECTORS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE BANKERS BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO. IS TO. PREJUDICE LEGITIMATE COLLECTION ACTIONS BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH PROCESS AROUND. THESE PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN IN THE COLLECTION ACTIONS THAT HAPPEN.

LET'S NOW TURN TO OPPOSITION MR CLIFF BURGER YOU AVAILABLE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CLOSE BERG HERE WITH GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS WE ARE OPPOSED AB FOUR TO FOUR AT THIS POINT- TWO MAJOR AREAS OF CONCERN THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION- EIGHTY FOUR TO FOUR IS REALLY ONE OF THREE BILLS THIS YEAR. THAT SEEK TO EXTEND PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR DEBT BUYERS ACT- TO COLLECTION AGENCIES AND YOUR CREDITORS- THAT ACT PROVIDES A UNIFORM REGULATORY SCHEME OF DOCUMENTATION NOTICE FOR DEBT BUYERS- EXTENDING INTO DEBT COLLECTORS IT IS CERTAINLY- DOABLE AND- WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO DOING THAT HOWEVER WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BILLS ONE STUDENT DEBT HERE ONE ON MEDICAL DEBT BY- SOMEONE WHO'D FRIEDMAN. AND OTHER BILLING GENERAL CONSUMER DEBT ACROSS THE BOARD THE SENATE BILL WENT THROUGH THIS COMEDIAN IS IN THE ASSEMBLY I BELIEVE WAS UP THIS MORNING- YEAH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT ALL THOSE CONCERNS WITH THE OTHER TWO BILLS WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO GET IT STANDARDIZED NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN HAVING. CONFLICTING REGULATORY SCHEMES US DOCUMENTATION AND NOTICE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WITH MR STONE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH HIS STAFF AND THE BILL'S SPONSORS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. WE. THINK IT IS THAT THAT IS DOABLE. ASSUR TRY TO GET THE STANDARD THESE KINDS OF DOCUMENTS THREE REQUIREMENTS THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS. CONCERN THAT I WANT TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION IS THE- PENALTY PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A PROVISION THAT HAS A PER VIOLATION- STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD- GENERALLY WAS REQUIRED ABILITY IT'S PER ACTION. AND THIS BILL IS EXTENDING AN EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FROM THE WINDOW BUILDING CERTIFIERS ACT- THAT WAS PER ACTION NOT PER VIOLATION I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION ALSO THAT. THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR SB NINE AWAIT JUST ABOLITION IS ALL LICENSING OF DEBT BUYERS DEBT COLLECTORS AND- COLLECTION ATTORNEYS BY THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF THE FBI WHICH PROVIDES A GREATER FORCE MAGNETIC MECHANISM WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD IS. THAT THERE ARE BAD ACTORS OUT THERE AND NONE OF WHOM ARE MEMBERS WHO NEED INSURANCE TERM BAD ACTIVITY I THINK IF THE AUTHOR IN HIS STAFF LOOKS AT THE- NEW LICENSING LAW IN THE IN THE POWERS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE DEPARTMENT. THERE'S REALLY A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD PATH TO GETTING THE BAD ACTORS WHICH IS TAKING AWAY THEIR LICENSE FOR A DEBT COLLECTION IN CALIFORNIA SO ANYWAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. AND HIS STAFF ON THE SPONSORED ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BERG ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION I SEE NO ONE IN THE GALLERY I SEE NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE.

THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN Q. ALL RIGHT- SEE NO ONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO COMMENT. ADULT CENTER WACO SKI YES THERE WERE KELSEY. MISTER CHAIR I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS BILL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE STANDARD OF PROOF. FOR THE EVIDENCE FREE PROOF MUST BE HIGHER WHEN AS- PLAYERS GO INTO CALIFORNIA COURTS TO GET JUDGMENTS AGAINST CALIFORNIANS TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT ANY DEFECT IN THE PLEADINGS ARE SOME I OR T. THAT'S NOT CROSS SHOULD. SHOULD R. STAHL THE JUDGMENT AGAINST CREEK CALIFORNIA DEBTORS AND THE REASON IS AND SHE IT'S ILLOGICAL BUT- BUT THE FEDERAL LAW MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN STUDENT AT AND ALL OTHER DEBT. AND IT'S A FREAK OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM THAT THAT HAPPENS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN DEBT WAS THIS CHARGEABLE IN BANKRUPTCY SO THERE WAS A BALANCE THAT WENT ON BETWEEN THE AGGRESSIVE. COLLECTION IN A DEBTOR'S ABILITY TO PLAY AND BY SOME BAD TOOTH. STROKE OF LUCK NOW STUDENT PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS IS NOT THIS CHARGE WILL END IN BANKRUPTCY COURT BUT A MEDICAL DEBT IS A CREDIT CARD DEBT IS AND ALL THESE OTHER TICKETS TO WIN SO WHEN THE ACTIVITIES GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA COURTS TO COLLECT THESE DEBTS AGAINST. OUR CONSUMERS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE RISING COSTS OF STUDENT LOANS BUT THEY THEY HAVE NO OTHER BACKDROP EXCEPT FOR THIS LONG FOR THIS VERSION OF AB OF FOUR TO FOUR TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS CORRECT BECAUSE THAT.

SO REMEMBER STONE YOU COULD PROCEED. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND ENSURE TWELVE SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MEXICANAS TOOK SOME ACTION TO PROTECT THE GI BILL. AND THEN. IT WAS VERY WELL CONSIDERED AND IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE STEP. BUT WHAT THEY MISSED WAS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GI FUNDS FOR EDUCATION ONLY GO TO ABA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS. AND WHAT THEY DID NOT REALIZE IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY HIGH STANDARD FOR CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS. IN FACT A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CREDIT LAW SCHOOLS THESE ARE NONPROFITS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE WERE VERY VIABLE OPTIONS FOR. ATTORNEYS IN AS WE HAVE IS BOTH OF OUR COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD. TO PROVIDE DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AT THE BENCH AT THE BAR. AND THROUGH THE SCHOOLS THESE. CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS FILL THAT FUNCTION AND THE BAR PASS RATE IN MOST OF THE SCHOOLS IS HIGHER THAN MANY. NATIONAL ABA ACCREDITED SCHOOLS SO WE THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE OR A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE QUALITY OF CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS. THAT LED TO THE DECISION TO PRECLUDE THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE THEIR STUDENTS. BE FUNDED BY THE GI BILL SO THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST SAYING CONGRESS HEY. TAKE A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF OUR CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED. LAW SCHOOLS THESE ARE NOT. THE DIPLOMA THESE ARE NOT THESE FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT TAKE PEOPLE'S MONEY PROVIDED SUBSTANDARD EDUCATION. AND THEN THEY CAN'T PASS THE BAR THE CAMP PRACTICE THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG WHEN IT COMES TO THESE LAW SCHOOLS THIS IS JUST A NATURE ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SITUATION. AND THINK ABOUT CHANGING WHAT THEY HAVE DONE SO THAT CALIFORNIA'S HIGH QUALITY ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS CAN TAKE IN STUDENTS WITH. WITH GI BILL FUNDING. AND WITH THAT I HAVE FOR MY ROOM.

TODAY I SERVE AN ORGANIZATION CALLED VETERANS EDUCATION SUCCESS AND I LIVE IN WORK IN VIRGINIA WITH MY FAMILY IN AN ECONOMY THAT SWITCHES ON A DIME THE MOBILITY OF PATRONS AND OUR FAMILIES IS PARAMOUNT THE PROTECTED YEAH THE LACK IN ITS ENTIRETY ENSURES THAT THE GI BILL BENEFITS LEAD TO A DEGREE TO HAVE MOBILITY THE JOB MARKET THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE MILITARY FAMILIES WHO FREQUENTLY RELOCATE ACROSS STATE LINES APR TWELFTH IS A RESOLUTION TO PROTECT THE LAW SCHOOLS OTHER STATES U. S. UNACCREDITED IT IS NOT A RESOLUTION TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THAT ORANGE. THESE ARE NOT INSTITUTIONS ACCREDITED BY A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ACCREDITOR AND THEIR NUMBERS TELL YOU THAT ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW OVER 25% HAVE BEEN PLACED ON PROBATION THROUGH JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO DUE TO A NON COMPLIANT MINIMUM PASSAGE RATE OR HAVE LOST ACCREDITATION ENTIRELY NONE OF THE SCHOOLS MET THE MINIMUM AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION PASS RATE OF SEVENTY PART 35% THIS PAST YEAR. AND ONE FINAL EXAMPLE THE UNIVERSITY WEST LOS ANGELES ACCORDING TO THE STATE PARK PUBLISHED EXAM STATISTICS UW LA AS THEY REPORTED BAR PASSAGE RATE OF JUST 9% IS THIS THE KIND OF QUALITY THAT WE EXPECT FOR VETERANS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU STAND WITH VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS NATIONWIDE NOT WITH THE LAW SCHOOLS PROTECTING WHAT AGREE DOT COM IS ONE OF THEIR OWN THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU AND I MISSPOKE OBVIOUSLY. THERE WAS SOMEONE IN OPPOSITION I THINK THE THAT MISTER HUBBARD. IT THAT YES THERE ARE RIGHT THANK YOU JUST TO IDENTIFY YOU SIDE YOU ALL RIGHT OTHERS IT UP ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION SAYING NO ONE IN THE GALLERY KNOWN ROOM ONE TWELVE- ON THE PHONE LINE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU LIKE TO COME IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. ALL RIGHT I SEE CENTER BARDS MICROPHONES RAISE CENTER BOARD JUST. THANK YOU CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO EXTEND- APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE- FOR AUTHORING A J. R. TWELVE. I THINK THE INDIVIDUAL THAT SPOKE A MOMENT AGO AND I HAD OCCASION TO READ AN EMAIL THAT HE SENT OUT- HAS BEEN VERY SELECTIVE IN FRANKLY DISINGENUOUS. ABOUT THE MOTIVES IN REPRESENTATIONS ON THE VALUE THE CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOLS HAVE TO OUR MILITARY COMMUNITY. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT FOLKS IN THE MILITARY. FOUR OUT OF THE MILITARY I HAVE TO RESIDE. IN PLACES WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE AN ABA ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOL. AND I JUST TALK ABOUT MONTEREY OR FRESNO OR A LOT OF THESE OTHER PLACES ESPECIALLY RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THAT LEGAL EDUCATION CAN ONLY BE GOTTEN- BY THE CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED- ALL INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA. SO FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL AND OTHERS TO CHALLENGE- WHETHER OR NOT MILITARY FOLKS SHOULD BE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE OUR GI BENEFITS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL IN THESE CALIFORNIA CREDITS- SCHOOLS. I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE LET'S TAKE- SOME OF THE METRICS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED EARLIER 75% BAR PASSAGE RATE WAS REPRESENTED AS THE MINIMUM WELL WITH THIS AUTHOR ON OR THIS OPPONENT FAILED TO MENTION THAT'S ON A TWO YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. AND EVEN SOME ABA ACCREDITED SCHOOLS DON'T HIT THAT NUMBER. AND SO I THINK THIS INDIVIDUAL IS CATEGORIZING ALL CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED SCHOOLS IN THE LAW WHO IS A- LAW DEGREE DOT COM SITUATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE WAS SAYING. BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FINE INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE A SERVICE TO FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE- HAVING GONE INTO THE MILITARY OR RETIRED FROM IT. AND IF ANYBODY CARES ABOUT PROVIDING LEGAL EDUCATION TO FOLKS IN- LESS POPULATED AREAS- OF RURAL AREAS. THAN THEY KNOW THE VALUE THAT THESE THESE THESE SCHOOLS PROVIDE LET THE INDIVIDUAL MAKE THE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO GO TO A SCHOOL THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED. IN ANOTHER STATE BUT FOR THOSE THAT KNOW THEY WANT TO PRACTICE AND LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD BE THEIR DECISION SO WE'RE HONORING THE MILITARY IN THEIR SERVICE- THROUGH THE GI BILL AND THE FUNDING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITYAND- BE ABLE TO WORK PURSUE THAT LEGAL EDUCATION IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO I WAS FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS. WE'LL LOOK UPON THE MERITS OF THE OF THIS POSITION INTO CALIFORNIA SERIOUSLY ON HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE. OF THE SERVICE IN THE EDUCATION IS PROVIDED SO SIR BOARD JUST MOVES A BILL- ALL RIGHT OTHER DISCUSSIONS A SINGLE MICROPHONES RAISE- I I'M SORRY SIR WE'RE JUST MOVE THE RESOLUTION- MAN CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL- I'M SORRY WOULD LIKE CLOSE. NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT THANK YOU SENATOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS. LOOKING AT THE CORRESPONDENCE THERE'S A REAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING THERE A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. THE SCHOOLS THAT FAIL TO GET A VISA CREDIT ATION AND ASSUMING THAT THAT MEANS THAT THEY BECOME CALIFORNIA CREDITED NOT CASE AT ALL. THESE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE CHOOSING CALIFORNIA ACCREDITATION NOT FAILING AT ABA ACCREDITATION. THERE'S A REAL DISCONNECT THERE. THAT'S THE POINT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. THESE ARE HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS MANY OF WHOM HAVE A HIGHER BAR PASS RATE. THAN SOME ABA ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. IN OTHER STATES SO. THERE'S A DISCONNECT AND A LACK OF INFORMATION WE'RE TRYING TO FILL IN THE LACK OF INFORMATION WITH THIS RESOLUTION ON ADS FOR YOUR ITEMS THANK YOU.
