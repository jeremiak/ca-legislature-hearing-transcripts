THE HEARING TOGETHER TO ORDER A FROM UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE- THIS IS OUR ANNUAL MEETING WITH THE CP YOU SEE AND OUR NEW PRESIDENT- SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE BRIEFED ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UTILITY REGULATORY AGENCY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND TO GET THEIR INSIDE AND PUT ON A VARIETY OF SUBJECT MATTER AND IT ALSO GIVES THE COMMITTEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS SO THIS WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US ALL TO ENGAGE AND WITH LAST YEAR BEING SUCH A- NO PUN INTENDED HIGH ENERGY YEAR- THIS- SHOULD PRODUCE I THINK HOPEFULLY SOME. IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT BEFORE WE GET STARTED AND I ASK MAYOR BILL BADGER PRESIDENT OF CPC TO COME FORWARD I WANT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE A NEW MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE AS OUR COMMITTEE SECRETARY- WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE AN S. AND CAROL IS FOR A NEW SECRETARY AND SHE COMES TO US FROM BEING THE COMMITTEE SO. OF THE PREVIOUSLY I CAN THE ASSISTANT TO SAY AS- AND HOW AMENDED UNDERSTAND OF LEGISLATIVE. AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU JOIN ME IN GENERAL WELCOME TO COMMITTEE. I JUST GOING TO SAY A FEW BRIEF OPENING COM THEN I'LL TURN TO OUR CHAIR FOR HIM TO. HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO AS WE AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM PRO BADGERED. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE ARE CERTAINLY TALK TO MY TIME IN THE- SO. AND THOUSAND NINE MAY ISSUE INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OR P. S. P. S. EVENTS WREAKED HAVOC. ON THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE. SHORTFALLS IN GENERATION SUPPLY WERE IDENTIFIED ELECTRICITY RATES CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. EACH OF THESE ISSUES A SIGNIFICANT AND INDICATIVE OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE REGULATORY ENTITY CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING OUR VITAL UTILITY SERVICES. AS WE HAVE SADLY FOUND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS HAVE BECOME MUCH TOO COMMON IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS DIRECTED BY PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SHATTERED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. IN THOSE UTILITIES AND IN THE INSTITUTIONS RICH WHICH REGULATE THEM. THE PS PS EVENTS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP TO RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN THE AREA IS SERVED BY THOSE UTILITIES. INCREASING THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION IS THE FACT THAT THESE UTILITIES WERE ILL PREPARED TO COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS IN REAL TIME. THE INABILITY OF THE UTILITIES TO INFORM THEIR CUSTOMERS ABOUT THE DURATION OF THE OUTAGES AND THE PRECAUTIONS THEY SHOULD FIX THAT IT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN EXACERBATED THE HORRIFIC SITUATION. MILLION OF CUT MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CONTENT WITH BLACKOUTS THAT LASTED MULTIPLE DAYS. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PRESS FROM PRESIDENT BADGER ABOUT THE ACTIONS THE CPUC HAS TAKEN TO MITIGATE P. S. P. S. EVENTS INCLUDING THE NECESSARY GREAT HARDENING AND ENHANCE COMMUNICATIONS. MOVING TO THE MATTER OF GENERATIONS SUPPLY SHORTAGES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT WAS DISTURBING TO LEARN A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT GENERATION SHORTAGES WHICH SEEM TO CATCH THE CPUC BY SURPRISE IT APPEARS THAT THREE FACTORS LARGELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SHORTFALL. FIRST A DECADE AGO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ADOPTED REGULATIONS THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE RETIREMENT OF NATURAL GAS PLANTS THAT RELY UON OCEAN WATER FOR COOLING. THE COMPLIANCE DATE IS NEARLY UPON US. MANY OF THESE THERMAL PLANTS ALONG THE COAST CURRENTLY PROVIDE GENERATION AND RELIABILITY SERVICES. SECOND IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT THE CQC LOWERED THE CAPACITY FACTOR FROM SOLAR. WHICH LED TO A NEAR THE RIVERS LED TO A NEED FOR REPLACEMENT GENERATION. THIRD AND THIRD TANK THANKFULLY COAL PLANTS IN THE INTERCONNECTED WESTERN GRID ARE RETIRING. THOSE RETIREMENTS OF CAUSE A REDUCTION OF GENERATION AVAILABLE FOR IMPORT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE CPUC DID NOT APPRECIATE THE GRAVITY OF THE SHORTFALL SOONER AND TAKE ACTION TO MITIGATE ITS IMPACT. WE'RE ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT STEPS TO CEBU CITY HAS INSTITUTED TO ADDRESS APPARENT DEFICIENCIES IN SYSTEM MODELING. LET ME BRIEFLY MOVED TO ELECTRICITY RATES. SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC ELECTRIC UTILITY YOUR ELECTRICITY RATES HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 50% IN TEN YEARS. IT APPEARS THAT SDG ANNE'S RATES ARE A HARBINGER OF INCREASES IN THE OTHER UTILITY TO UTILITIES COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT WILL BE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS WHICH RELY UPON GREATER ELECTRIFICATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS SECTOR OF ELECTRICITY RATES CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT THEIR CURRENT RATE. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM PRESIDENT BADGER ABOUT ACTIONS THIS INSTITUTION COULD TAKE TO BRING DOWN RATES. FINALLY LET ME TURN TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF P. GINNY. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE JOINS ME IN THE PASSAGE OF A C. R. SEVENTY EIGHT. THAT BILL ARTICULATES THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AND CALLS UPON REPRESENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC PRIORITIES IN ITS FILINGS WITH THE U. S. BANKRUPTCY COURT. AMONG THE PRIORITIES ARE ENSURING THE VICTIMS OF WILDFIRE CLAIMS ARE RESOLVED PROMPTLY AND EQUITABLY. EMPLOYEES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WAGES AND BENEFITS AND THAT ENVIRONMENTAL AND MANDATES OR ACHIEVED AND RATES ARE STABLE AND REASONABLE. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING HOW THE CPUC AS FULFILLING THESE PRIORITIES. I BEFORE I TURN TO YOU- A PRESENT BETTER- AND AGAIN WELCOME AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SIMON- I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO TURN- I SHOULD SAY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT IN WILL WELCOME BUT- WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE A FOR THE TASK. BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN TO MY VICE CHAIR AND GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW OPENING COMMENTS. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELCOME PRESIDENT AFTER I THAT WERE. ABOUT THAT ALL RIGHT THEN. I'M I LIKE TO THE LINE MY COMMENTS JUST OF THAT OF THE HE- I THINK STRUCK THE- RIGHT NOTES IN THE TONE AND THE LIST OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. KEEP US AWAKE AT NIGHT AND BECAUSE S. REAL CONCERN. AM I WANTED TO QUICKLY JUST POINT TO- WHAT I HAVE HAD A CONCERN OVER SENSE BEING VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT IS. THE ARK. OF COSTS THAT GO UP WHILE THE ARK OF RELIABILITY COMES DOWN THIS WHOLE SUPPLY DEMAND. GENERATION AND ALL OF THAT. AND IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL FIRST PRIORITY IS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON TO KEEP THEM AFFORDABLE. AND TO SOME DEGREE THAT MAY. REQUIRE SOME- MANAGEMENT IF YOU WILL OF SOME OF THE MANDATES AND SOME OF THE PARTICULAR KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE RELIABILITY OF THE COST- EXPLOSION- THE CHAIR REFERENCED- THE- THE NATURAL GAS PLANTS WHOSE LIFE WAS SUPPOSED TO END AT A PARTICULAR TIME THAT HAS BEEN EXTENDED. IT APPEARS TO ME OUT OF THE NECESSITY TO HAVE BASS LOW. AND TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THOSE LIGHTS ON- I THINK THESE ARE THE KINDS OF WARNING SIGNALS ARE THAT. MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE I SPECIALLY- HAVE REYES STAFF FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT ARE TWENTY INTO THE- TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET. WHERE THE HOME IS SILICON VALLEY. AND WE HAVE A GRID THAT IN MY JUDGMENT IS SLOWLY DETERIORATE. AND THERE'S A BIG CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF ALL OF US BUT I DO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. YOU AND I HAVE EXPERIENCE TIME TOGETHER OF WHEN I WAS MAYOR YOU WERE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION- AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BACK THEN I WILL WORKED EXCEEDINGLY WELL WITH YOU THEN PROCEEDED THE WORK YOU DID THEN. OBVIOUSLY THE CONCERNS OVER THE DMV DEREK HAVE TROUBLED US ALL I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHEN YOU WERE THE HEAD OF THE STRIKE GET A TEAM I THINK WE'RE SEEING SOME IMPROVEMENTS- AND I THINK YOUR- YOUR FINGERPRINTS WERE ALL OVER THAT AND I AM GRATEFUL. FOR IT. SO I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I THINK THIS WAS A STERLING APPOINTMENT. OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. YOU SEE- I THINK NEEDS THE KINDS OF- DEEP HISTORY- THAT YOU BRING. A SENSE OF THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. BEING A DIRECT AND CLEAR ON THE CHALLENGES WE FACE BUT ALSO. YOUR ABILITY I THINK TO BE. TO PRESENT TO US THE KINDS OF ALTERNATIVES AND THAT SOME OF THE DISCRETION NECESSARY TO MANAGE SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS OUR ELECTRICITY GRID. SO I WELCOME YOU I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND- WELCOME IS IN BADGER- I'M DELIGHTED YOU'RE WITH US. FOR SURE EARN. FROM MY ON. IT IS MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM YOUR DAHLE TO HAVE TWO OF SENIORS MEMBERS OF THE P. JOIN ME AT THE- I AM I AM A NEW AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS AS THOROUGHLY TODAY AS POSSIBLE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT INDULGENCE. SO THANK YOU- AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND. OVERLY KIND COMMENTS I HOPE IN SIX MONTHS FROM NOW YOU CAN SAY THE SAME THING. MY NAME IS MERRY BELL BACHELOR AND I SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CPC. I AM JOINED BY CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS- DIRECTOR OF THE WELFARE SAFETY VISION THE NEW DIVISION THAT WAS CREATED UNDER A. B. TEN FORTY FIVE FIFTY FOUR. AND FIVE SKEWS ME AND ALSO EDWARD RIGHT THERE'S NOT A STRANGER TO ANY OF YOU I'M SURE. DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY DIVISION AT THE CPUC. I WAS SWORN IN IN AUGUST SIXTH ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH INNING IN MY SHORT TIME. WITH THE CPUC I'VE SEEN DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF OUR LARGEST INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES JUST NAME TO NAME A FEW. SUCH ISSUES HAVE PRIORITIZE MY WORK. AND THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND OTHERS AB MEMBERS. AND YOUR STAFFS AND PARTICIPATION IN OVERSIGHT HEARINGS OF THESE ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE ALSO PRIORITIZING YOUR WORK. I WELCOME YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION BECAUSE IT WILL REQUIRE A BROAD AND THOROUGH EFFORT TO MAKE SURE WE THE NEEDS. AND EXPECTATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WE HAD INTO NEXT WHILE FIRE SEE. SEASONS AHEAD OF THAT AS WELL AS OTHER. IMAGES WE- I HAD. IS AS YOU KNOW A SET IN FIGHTER TO THE UTILITY WORLD I DON'T BRING. OF X. IN INNER POLICY OR UTILITY EGGS MANAGER TO MY- RATHER I LEAN ON SENSE COMMON EFFECTIVE JUST MAKING. AN ORGANISE MANAGE PRINCE. AND A CLEAR UNDER OF WHO I SERVE THE OF THIS GREAT STATE. I KNOW SOME OF YOU RIGHT NOW ARE THINKING SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID RATE PAYERS. I UNDERSTAND MY OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES TO PROTECTING RATE PAYERS BUT WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LAST TWO TO THREE YEARS WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRES. AND IMPACTS THAT THEY HAVE ADD HAD ON ALL OF US THROUGHOUT THE STATE AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS. AS I GO THROUGH MY PRESENTATION I REQUEST YOU NOT SEE THIS AS A REPORT OUT BUT IS AN INVITATION TO IDENTIFY AND COLLABORATE ON ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THOSE WE SERVE. AND ADDRESS. BY THE TIME I CAME TO THE SEAT. THE LET. HAD PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR. UTILITY WILDFIRE BILL PACKAGE ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY FOUR. AND THE ACCOMPANYING TRAILER BILL AB ONE ELEVEN SINCE THEN THE CPUC HAS TAKEN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT BOTH BILLS WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE WELFARE SAFETY DIVISION AND HIRED ITS DIRECTOR. CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS CAROLINE- IS SETTING UP FOR OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT THE AGGRESSIVE GOALS SET FORTH IN AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WE HAVE ALSO COMMENCED CORRECT COORDINATION WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY ON PLANNING FOR THE TRANSFER OF THIS DIVISION TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS DICTATED BY THE STATUTE WE ALSO ISSUED A RULING IN DECEMBER WHICH SET PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANTS. WE ESTABLISHED THE WELFARE FUND AND THE WELFARE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD HELD ITS FIRST MEETING JUST YESTERDAY. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN DEVELOPED BY EACH OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IS BECOMING A KEY FRAME MARK IN THE ASSESSING THE PREPAREDNESS EFFECTIVENESS I- USE IT CAN'T. VENTA YOU TELL BECAUSE OF. AS WE AS THE EFFECT. OF PER ELEMENTS INCLUDING THE USE OF P. S. P. S. THE ELECTRIC UTILITY SUBMITTED THEIR FIRST WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS W. M. P.'S TO THE C. U. B. C. IN TWENTY NINETEEN. BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN SUBMISSIONS AND THE WILDFIRE SEASONS OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION AND THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION STAFF ARE IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO THE W. M. P. PROCESS SUCH AS REFINING THE W. MP GUIDELINES. THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE W. M. P. PROCESS AS THESE GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO AID IN THE EVALUATION OF THE UTILITIES WHILE FIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS AND TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE COMMISSION'S LONG TERM. WILDFIRE F. AND- WE HAVE A- SOUGHT. PUBLIC PER OF. IN ALL SEE PUBLIC ON THE NEW W. MP GUIDELINES TEMPLATE AND PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TOOLS TO THE W. M. P. PROCEEDINGS THE CPUC IS SOLICITING INPUT FROM THE WILD SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD FOR THIS YEAR'S W. M. PEAS AND FOR UPDATING THE GUIDELINES LATER THIS YEAR. AND WILL INCORPORATE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY W. M. P. EVALUATION PROCESS THERE IS A NEW STORE YESTERDAY THAT WAS WRONG IN IN THAT EVALUATION AND I WANTED TO CLEAR THAT UP. DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN WILDFIRE SEASON UTILITIES RESORTED TO P. S. P. S. AS THE MEASURE OF LAST RESORT OFTEN AND BROADLY. WE ARE USING THE NEW TWENTY TWENTY WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN GUIDELINES TO MAKE THE UTILITIES ARTICULATE AND I'LL I'LL TURN LEAD. IMPLEMENT HOW THEY WILL REDUCE THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF FUTURE PS PS EVENTS AND WE WILL HAVE IT DONE IN TIME WELL BEFORE THE P. S. P. S. SEASON. WHICH IS THE WILDFIRE SEASON FOR EXAMPLE THIS YEAR'S WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO TELL US HOW THEY ARE USING THE SYSTEM HARDENING. IMPROVED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND GRID RE DESIGN TO REDUCE THE SCOPE AND THE DURATION OF THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS IN THE COMING YEAR. CAROLINE TA JACOBS HERE TODAY WITH ME IN THE EVENT AS I SAID EARLIER THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY MORE SPECIFICS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ON THE MODELING AND THE GUIDELINES AND INDEED THE PROGRESS. THAT THE METRICS FOR THE W. MPS ARE SHOWING. AND GIVEN THE IMPACT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THE THREAT TO THEIR SAFETY AS WELL AS A CONSIDERABLE DISRUPTION TO COMMERCE AND TRANSPORTATION. IT IS CRITICAL TO UNCOVER WHAT WENT WRONG HOW THE PS PS OF BILLS WERE MISMANAGED BY THE UTILITIES BE ON DISTURBING EXCUSE ME DISTRIBUTING THE NEW GUIDELINES AND EVALUATION TOOLS FOR THE W. M. PEAS WE ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING ONE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE UTILITIES PROCEDURES TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN PS YES OF HANDS. AND TELL IT IN AND CO. FIRST LOCAL. STATE AGENT. AT UTILITIES MANAGEMENT OF ITS RESOURCE TO A PUBLIC SAFETY THIS SO CA ON A NUMBER OF THE PSP RECORD TO ADDRESS TO FISH. FOR A THE I. O. U.'S PARTICULARLY JEANNIE NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER MAPS FOR THE PS PS EVENTS THEY NEED TO COORDINATE MORE CLOSELY WITH WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE PRIORITIZATION PS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES SUCH AS BRAILLE PRIORITIZING LOCATIONS FOR SECTIONAL ISING DEVELOPING MICRO GRIDS TO BUILDERS. FOR CRITICAL SERVICES AND FOR PRE CANA FIND INSTEAD FOR COMPREHENSIVE UNITY RESOURCE CENTERS. TO IMPROVE THEIR TIMING AND BRING OF CUSTOMER. THEY KNEW TO REACH OUT. REACH ALL OF THE APPROPRIATE CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE TIMELINE SPECIFIED IN THE CURRENT P. S. P. S. GUIDELINES PUT FORTH BY THE PC. THEY NEED TO PROVE THEY USED PS PS AS INDEED A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. THESE ISSUES ALONG WITH OTHERS ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN EXISTING PSCS PROCEEDINGS AND WILL BE CENTRAL TO PLANNING MEETINGS BETWEEN THE OPERATIONS TEAMS THE CPUC CALLOW YES CAL FIRE AND THE I. O. USED I WAS WE PREPARE FOR THE UPCOMING WELFARE SEASON. WE ARE ALSO YES THE SCOPE PRIVATE PARTIES OF EXIST PROGRAM TO SUPPORT. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF FUTURE P. S. P. S. EVENTS FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEK AT THE JANUARY SIXTEENTH COMMISSION MEETING THE CPUC APPROVED ADDING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS. TO THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM KNOWN AS ASH CHIP WITH 63% OF THAT FUNDING GORGEOUS OF CLEAN BACKUP POWER OR VULNERABLE CUTS. AND IT'LL- STILL IT IS. THIS FIVE DAY. LITTLES AND PERSON HOME AREAS ARE MOST. TO DID BY. IN A THE ENERGY TO BE RELEASE A PROPOS JUST YESTERDAY AS PART OF THE MIKE CREDIT AND REYES PROCEED THAT WILL BE CRIED TO GET THE MEETINGS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNT OFFICE OF EMERGENCIES. AT EACH ME YOU WILL BE RE TO SHOW IN ABOUT ELECT TO AND- FOR STRUCTURE INCLUDING ANY PLANS HARDENING IN THAT COUNTY. THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT ON I OWE YOU BUT ALSO CREWS. IMPORTANCE TO ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE RESILIENCY OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. THESE MOST RECENT PS THREE PS EVENTS IN PARTICULAR RESULTED IN MAJOR IMPACTS TO COMMUNICATIONS GRID CUSTOMERS OF ALL SERVICES WERE IMPACT WHETHER WINT ACTED WHETHER THE LAND LINE. CABLE V. O. I. P. OR WIRELESS CARRIERS REPORTED OUTAGES FOR NEAR. HALF A MILLION WIRE LINE STEAMER ALMOST A MILLION WIRE CUSTOMERS. CELL SITES WERE SERVICE THE VARIOUS LENGTHS OF TIME AND WIRELINE. ALSO PARTICULARLY CABLE PROVIDER. THESE OUT WERE UNDER. GIVEN THE ASSURANCE THE COMMUNICATION COMPANIES PROVIDED TO THE FCC THE STATE TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE P. YOU SEE THESE COMPANIES HAVE OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSE. TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE CPUS DE IS CONSIDERING REQUIRING TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO PROVIDE BACKUP BATTERY POWER AND GENERATORS AT SELLERS SITES HARDENING COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND REQUIRE AND COMMUNICATE ITS CARRIERS. HIS IN PLANNING SIZES WE THE ELECTRIC I OWE YOU IN IT OF THE WILD SEASON WE'RE ALSO RECORD AND THAT THE IDEA USE PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE. CAPTION TO ASIAN COME SO THAT MINIMUM PACKED UP SB PS EVENTS ON THEIR NETWORK. TO FUND UP BY THE SEA. FOR WELFARE PREVENT AND SAYS HARD. PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH THE ESTIMATE PART OF THE TWO NINE WELL MITIGATION PLAN. THESE CUSTOM MUST BE UP. THROUGH EACH YOU TELL GENERAL K. IN THERE TO NINETEEN DONE M. P. THE I. O. U. OUTLINE. A NEED FOR THREE POINT FOUR I'VE THREE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL AT THE MAJOR KERR ADDICT. ADDRESS WILDFIRE RISK THE. ABOUT THEIR CURRENT PROJECTIONS OUR CALCULATIONS ESTIMATE THAT FOR EVERY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN W. M. P. WELL FIRE MITIGATION PLAN SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE BY P. G. ANY WE CAN ANTICIPATE APPROXIMATELY AN EIGHTY DOLLAR ANNUAL INCREASE IN AVERAGE THE DENTAL BILLS WHICH IS A SEVEN CENT INCREASE IN A DENTAL RATE. WE HAVE ALSO DID THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH A FEW SLIDES THAT OUTLINED THE TRANS AN ELECTRIC SYSTEM RATES FOR YEARS OH FIVE THROUGH EIGHTEEN WE SEE RATE SPENDING APART. HISTORICALLY RATE INCREASES HAVE VERY CLOSELY TRACKED WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION BUT AS THE TABLE SHOWS THAT TRIP HAS NOT HELD TRUE FOR EXAMPLE WITH S. D. G. D. SAN DIEGO AND ELECTRIC. RATES ARE RISING WELL ABOVE THE OTHER UTILITIES THE CPUC IS CONCERNED WE WILL SEE SIMILAR TRENDS BUT OTHER TELL IT SOME FACTORS LEE. TO THE S. D. G. ANY INCREASES IN. THE INCREASE TEST. INTEREST WHICH MAY SENSE THERE OF THE SIX OH SEVEN YOU. AND UP I NEED TO MAKE. AS THE OTHER UTILITY STARTIN BEING OR DUB M. P. AND THEIR INTO CAN TO DECREASE AS FOR. THE RATES FOR CASH TO GO UP AS WELL. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE THIS UP TO HIGHLIGHT THE RECENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFETY POLICY DIVISION AT THE CPUC THE MAKE THE COMMISSION DECIDED IN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN TO CREATE THIS NEW DIVISION TO DEVELOP. ANALYZE AND ASSIST IN THE IMPLEMENTING SAFETY POLICIES AS PART OF OUR REGULATION OF ELECTRIC GAPS TELECOMMUTE. WHAT TRANSPORTATION NOBODY'S THE SAFETY POLICY. DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AMONG OTHER THINGS PERFORMING RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MITIGATION WITHIN THE UTILITY GENERAL RATE CASES. I WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT OF NEW ELECTRIC GENERATION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CPUC STAFF ADJUSTED ITS ASSUMPTIONS AROUND A RELIABILITY MODELING AND DETERMINED THAT THE STATE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC RESOURCES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEW MODEL THE CPUC ISSUED A RULING REQUESTING PARTIES COMMENTS AND INPUT ON NEXT STEPS THIS RESULTED IN A PROCUREMENT DECISION DIRECTING ALL LOAD SERVICE PLEASE TO BUY A- THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCE TO BE BROUGHT ONLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO ALSO RECTOR. A ONE TO YEAR X. UPPER. OF SOME. GAS PLANTS THAT WERE SET TO RETIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PROVIDE. TIME FOR NEW RESOURCES TO COMPETE TO BE COMPLETED I THINK YOU ARE BOTH THE CHAIRMAN AND THE VICE CHAIRMAN MENTION THE PLANTS EARLIER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS ON THE NEW PROCUREMENT SUCH THAT MOST IF NOT ALL. OF THE NEW RESEARCH HAS WILL BE RENEWABLE DEMAND RESPONSE AND BATTERY STORAGE THE KEY DRIVERS OF THE CHANGE IN FORECASTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WERE THE INCREASE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. WHICH HAS PUSHED THE STATE'S PEAK AND LATER IN THE DAY WHEN WIND SOLAR ARE NOT FULLY AVAILABLE. AND IN ADDITION WE NEED TO REFLECT THE CHANGING RELIABILITY NEEDS OF THE STATE DO GREATER CONTRIBUTIONS OF ONE AND AN SELLER SOURCES. THE CPUC ALSO PROVIDE ASSIST TENDS ON HOW ELECT ISN'T IT IS AVAILABLE TO IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA AS A SYSTEM TITANS THROUGHOUT THE WEST THE RETIREMENT OF COAL AND GAS FIRED SIR. PLANNING SOME REAP OF IMPORT OF ENERGY AND THE CAPACITY TO CATER TO CALIFORNIA WILL BE TWO DID LIKE NEED BE. TEN FIVE STE IN SHORT THE CBO DOES NOT BUT THAT IT CAN RELY ON IN. TO THE EXTENT IT MAY HAVE IN THE- AN IN A- THERE WERE SOME UNEXPECTED UNEXPECTED POWER RESEARCH RETIREMENTS FURTHER REDUCING THE RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO MEET THE STATE'S GREAT LIABILITY OBJECTIVES. TO RIP THESE FROM A CURRENT AGAIN THE CPUC HAS TAKEN THE FOLLOWING STEPS THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCEEDING WILL HAVE AN ON GOING TRACK THAT IT DID NOT IDENTIFIES NEAR TERM RELIABILITY AND NEEDS AN- E. E. C. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION CPUC. AND CAL ICE WHICH YOU'RE- FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MODELING ELECTRIC AND GENERATION NEED A TRANSMISSION. WILL CAN YOU WORK TO REFI. THE MY PROCESS TO BETTER ANTICIPATE GIFTING NEEDS AND THE GRAD. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ENTITIES CAN ENERGY PER. AS KNOW WE ARE A LOAD SHIP FROM THE I. O. TO THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AG. AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS CCA HAVE GROWN RAPIDLY FROM SERVING ZERO POINT 5% OF THE LOAD IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO SERVE ANY PROJECTED 29% OF THE LOAD IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. MEANWHILE THE I'LL USE SERVING LOAD HAS DECREASED FROM 90% TWENTY FOURTEEN TO A PROJECTED 59% AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. EVEN THOUGH THE IDEA YOU STILL REPRESENT CCA'S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE NEW PROCUREMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE IOUS HAVE LONG TERM CONTRACTS FOR MOST OF THEIR FUTURE NEEDS I ALSO. I WOULD ALSO I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON MICHAEL GRADES SINCE THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN RAISED A LOT RECENTLY AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF PS PS EVENTS. THE CPUC OPEN A NEW RULE MAKING ON MICHAEL GRIDS AND OTHER RESILIENCY SOLUTIONS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ENERGY DIVISION FORMED A NEW TEAM DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO MY GROUP IT'S AN TO RESILIENCY. MID DECEMBER WE AND CO OPERATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HOSTED A PUBLIC WORSHIP WORKSHOP. TO OF DIGNIFIED AND VET IDEAS FOR SHORT TERM ACTIONS THAT THE CPUC COULD TAKE TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF MICRO GRIDS AND OTHER RESILIENCY SOLUTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE ALSO DIRECTED STAFF AND THE LARGE I- USED TO PROPOSE SHORT TERM ACTION RELATED TO MY COOKING GRIDS THAT COULD MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF PS PS OUTAGES IN TWENTY TWENTY. STAFF A PROPOSED EXPEDITING UTILITY APPROVAL OF THE MICHAEL GRID PROJECTS BY SIMPLIFYING INTERCONNECTION APPLICATIONS AND DIRECTING UTILITIES TO SHARE INFRASTRUCTURE DATA WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENABLE COLLABORATIVE PLANNING. OF THE NEW MICHAEL GRADE AND RESILIENCY PROJECTS. WE EXPECT TO CONCLUDE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SHORT TERM ACTIONS BY THIS SPRING. THE OF ADDITION MICHAEL AND WE- POLICY INCLUDING THOSE WERE BY SB THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVER THE REST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE DEPLOYMENT OF MICRO GRIDS AND THEIR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF PS PS EVENTS ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO WHO BEARS THE COST OF DEPLOYING THESE SYSTEMS AND WHO BENEFITS. I SHOULD HIGHLIGHT THE ESPYS THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE WAS EXPLICIT IN PROTECTING NON BENEFITING RATE PAYERS FROM PAYING THE COST OF THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER DESPITE THE RATIONAL COST CONTAINMENT APPROACH THERE ARE STILL ACTIONS AT THE CPUC CAN TAKE TO FACILITATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF MICHAEL GOODS FOR BENEFITING THE RATE PAYERS. BEFORE I CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO HIGH THE COLLABORATION WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES IN THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE TO ACHIEVING OUR AMBITIOUS STATE CLEAN ENERGY AND G. H. G. REDUCTION GOALS. WE ARE CURRENT CURRENTLY COORDINATE THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET GEN THE- AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON THE SP ONE HUNDRED JOINT SINCE HE REPORT WE DO TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. I'M SORRY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE REPORT WILL BITE SITE ON THE ALLEN JUST COPPER HE'S OF ACHIEVING THE TO THIRTY FIVE HELLO SECTOR GOAL WHEREBY A PERCENT OUR ELECTRIC RE. SALES ARE SUPPLIED BY CARBON RESOURCES. LOOKING AT WHERE WE ARE TO WE HAVE PROVIDE SLIDES ON THE ELECTRIC SECTOR IN EMISSIONS. THESE SLIDE SHOW THAT IN MAY HAVE GONE DOWN IN THE ELECTRIC. WHICH MAKES 50% OF THE STAY IN MAY. AS I THINK YOU WERE WHERE THE STATE HAS ALREADY MET IT'S TWENTY TWENTY G. H. G. GOALS AND ALMOST ALL OF THOSE REDUCTIONS HAVE COME FROM THE ENERGY SECTOR. ELECTRICITY SECTOR IS ALSO ALREADY ON TRACK TO MEET THE SECTOR GOALS ESTABLISHED BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD FOR TWENTY THIRTY. FINALLY THE COMMITTEE HAS REQUESTED THAT I'D ADDRESS THE C. P. UC'S ROLE IN THE ON GOING P. G. IN A BANKRUPTCY CASE PLEASE BE PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN ONLY SAY SOME LIMITED THINGS. ABOUT THE BANKRUPTCY BUT I WILL TRY AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THAT I HAVEN'T REPORTED ON. I CAN REPORT THAT THE CPUC HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE COURTROOM. OUR EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON VARIOUS INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES OF CONCERN TO THE COMMISSION. I CAN SHARE THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED THE PUBLIC PURPOSE MOTIONS TO ENSURE THAT LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. DURING THE CHAPTER ELEVEN CASES DESPITE THE AUTOMATIC STAY IMPOSED BY THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED BY THE BANK GOT SICK. TO NOT WITHSTAND THE CHAP ELEVEN. INCLUDE ENERGY EFFICIENCY BIOMASS AND BY A METHANE PROGRAMS THE ELECTRIC PROGRAM INFEST INVESTMENT CHARGE EPIC. WHICH FUNDS OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AN INTERVENOR COMPENSATION THESE WERE ISSUES RAISED AS AREAS OF CONCERN. FOR AIR FOR VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. UNDER BOTH THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY RULES AND AB TEN FIFTY FOUR THE CPUC MUST APPROVE THE BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND FIND THAT IT MEETS SPECIFIC CONDITIONS. THE MECHANISM FOR APPROVED AN AGREEMENT WOULD BE A VOTE. FULL COMMISSION IN A PROCEEDING THAT GIVES THE INTERESTED PARTIES. RETURN EVER ON THE A GROUP. ON SEPTEMBER SIX TWENTY. THE CBC OPEN THE FOR PURSE. TO CONSIDER THE RATE MAY AN OTHER IN OF A PER PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. SINCE THIS SEEING MY INDEPENDENT APPROVED THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND THE COMMISSIONERS CANNOT COMMIT TO THEIR FINAL DECISION UNTIL ALL PARTIES HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT PRESENT EVIDENCE IN OUR PROCEEDINGS THE COMMISSION AS A WHOLE NEEDS TO KEEP SOME DISTANCE FROM THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT BUT SENIOR STAFF OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND FIND AN ACTUAL ADVISORS. HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PRECEDING TO HELP AYE GUIDANCE TO THE COURT AND INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE BANKRUPTCY. A CASE THE CPUS FOCUS FOR ME. ON AND THAT WHILE FIRE VICTIMS ARE COMPENSATED AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE AT REASONABLE RATES CONSISTENT WITH ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE HOLES. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TO YOU AND TO ALLOW ME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECT MATTERS FACING SEE YOU PC TODAY. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL SAY THAT YOUR PRESENTATION WAS COMPREHENSIVE IT TOUCHED ON ALL OF THE AREAS THAT ANCHOR IMPORTANT. THE CERTAINLY THEY CAN AT LARGE. TERMS OF AIR BEFORE. I'M GOING TO TURN TO MIKE. I HAVE A QUESTIONS BUT YOU TO MIKE TO MAYBE. AND A THEN WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS INCLUDED A IS MEMBER THERE LIKE TO. A DOCTOR QUIRK. FOR OF ALL WE SHOULD BE. YOU MAY PRESIDENT WHICH BE THANK YOU. BECAUSE OF WE KNOW HOW. JOB SO AT THE P. U. C. K. BE. AND OF COURSE. YOU JUST GOT THERE WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE. OF YOUR EFFORTS AND THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR GENERAL SITUATION I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO ALL OF MY QUESTIONS TODAY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU COULD EITHER GIVE US AN ANSWER NOW OR LATER WOULD BE FINE- I AM CONCERNED THAT THE P. YOU SEE- HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT OPENING UP A LEASE SO CANYON AGAIN. AND THE REASON I'M CONCERNED IS THAT IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON RELIABILITY OF GAS- BUT ALSO RELIABILITY OF ELECTRICITY- AND ALSO AN IMPACT ON COSTS FOR BOTH GAS AND ELECTRICITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE IMPACTS OUR- BUT I'D BE. FIRST BY ASKING THAT LOOK AT THOSE IMPACTS I SHOULD YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT ALLOWING A LEASE CANYON OPEN AGAIN- DO YOU WISH TO MAKE A RESPONSE TO THE ISSUES. I'M A THIRD THANK YOU BURKE I WE HAVE RECEIVED I RECEIVE I BELIEVE WAS IN DECEMBER. A LETTER FROM THE GOV. QUESTION THAT IMMEDIATELY IN A STUDY. OF A LEASE CANYON AND AN WE HAVE WE SECURED THE FUND IN THE BY FOR THAT AND WE- BEGUN TO AND- THAT WILL BE A STUD OF THE SAID YOU JUST OUTLINED SIR OF IS A AND IN AND THAT BE DONE WHAT THIS YEAR AND I'M GONNA TO MISTER UP TO SEE SENATE. HE NEEDS TO ADD. THANK UP. SOME OF OUR- YEAH I AS I THINK YOU ARE WHERE WE HAVE NO PROCEED ON THAT THE ISSUE. I IT'S PRETTY TO SAY THAT THE- HAS OF YOU ONE WAY OR NOW ALL THE TERM A NECESSITY FOR LEASE SO ALL IF THERE ARE SUFFICIENT MEASURES CAN BE TAKEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL OFFER TO BE SHUT DOWN- AS- YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE LEGISLATION FOR. SEVERAL YEARS AGO REQUIRES THE COMMISSION- TO OPEN A PROCEEDING- TO LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING- IN THAT PROCEEDING IS BEING DRIVEN- IN LARGE PART BY- CONSULTANT MODELING- AND THEN MODELING FROM WITH AND I THINK THE COMMISSION. TO ASK THAT VERY. TO IT IS THE QUICKLY FEASIBLE. FEASIBLE FOR LIABILITY STANDPOINT THE SHUTDOWN BUT ALSO ASKING THE OTHER SET OF QUESTIONS WHICH IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR UST ASK US TO DO. BOB IS WHAT. NOT ONLY IS IT FOR DO BUT IF WE DO DO IT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO DO IT. RIGHT YEAH. THAT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY GOOD. AND THEN PLEASE THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE. ARM INFORMED WHICH I'M SURE HE WANTS TO BE KEPT INFORMED- EVEN THOUGH HE DOES GET IS- ELECTRICITY FROM PASADENA POWER BUT AT ANY RATE NOW IT JUST TO KEEP HIM INFORMED AND HE WILL KEEP US INFORMED WE WILL INDEED THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT. I CONCERNED. THE FIRST THING THAT PEOPLE SAID WHEN THE FOR FIRST OF ALL WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THIS FIRES GO. THE LAST TIME I HEARD NUMBERS ON THIS AOUT 7% OF FIRES ARE STARTED BY UTILITY WIRES AND ABOUT IT BUT HOWEVER THEY DO BECAUSE ABOUT 20% OF THE DAMAGE SO THEIR HEAVY HITTERS. PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY START ARE CLOSER TO WHERE THEY ARE THEY ARE ROUTE THERE ARE PEOPLE BUT IT'S STILL NOT JUST SHUTTING OFF POWER IS GOING TO STOP US FROM HAVING- A WILDFIRES WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THIS FALL THAT WE DID NOT GET A LOT OF WILDFIRES- I AM WORRIED THAT THIS AT THAT. FIRST WEEK CHAIR PNG PAGE IN A AND OTHER UTILITIES DOWN FOR NOT. DE ENERGIZING NOW WERE TEARING THEM DOWN FOR G. ENERGIZING AND WHILE I REALIZE THAT IT HAS THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION. IN TERMS OF. PROBABLY BE MORE WIDESPREAD THAT AND HOW TO BE SIMPLY BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO DO IT. DO TO MAKE. YOU'RE SAYING P. S. P. AS SHOULD BE THE LAST RESORT THAT IS THE POWER SHUTDOWNS FIRST PUBLIC SAFETY- I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T THAT LEAD TO MORE FIRES AND I THINK WEHAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE SAY THAT THIS IS THE LAST RESORT AND AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A- COMMENT THERE. YES SIR THANK YOU- THIS IS THE MANY THINGS THAT I HAVE MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY THAT THE PC IS UNDERTAKEN. IS OUR ATTEMPT TO AN OBJECTIVE IS INDEED TO GET TO. MAY I USE THE WORD MORE SURGICAL PS PS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS AND THOSE THINGS LIKE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE GETTING TO THOSE THINGS- THAT WILL INDEED ALLOW THE I. O. USE TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE WHEN THEY DO PULL THE LEVER. THAT IT IS THE LAST RESORT ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF COURSE IS. ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NOT TURNING OFF THE ENERGY AND THE DANGERS OF TURNING OFF THE ENERGY RIGHT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BALANCE AND WE WERE LACKEY WE DID HAVE A OF FIRES THIS FALL- YOU KNOW THE KINCAID FIRE. WAS QUITE LARGE AND WAS WITH ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING- THANK GOODNESS WE DID NOT LOSE LIVES THIS YEAR. BUT THE FEAR WAS THAT- THE LOSS OF POWER IS ALSO ENDANGERING OF EOPLE'S LIVES SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A INCREDIBLE CARE THAT THOSE DECISIONS TO TURN OFF THE POWER OF THE ELECTRICITY AND WHERE AND HOW AND THE NOTIFICATION OF THAT IS DONE EXTREMELY EXTREMELY WELL. IT WASN'T THIS YEAR AND THE MANY THINGS THAT I MENTIONED HERE THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING FOR THIS YEAR FIRE SEASON FROM REGULATORS ARE NOT KNOWN TO BE NIMBLE. WE'RE GONNA BE IS AS WEAK AS I CAN MAKE CUTS FOR THIS FIRE SEASON ON MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON AND WORKING ON A COMBINED. A COMBINATION WITH- KALLIO YES AND CAL FIRE AND OUR OTHER SISTER. AGENCIES THAT WILL BE INVOLVED. THANK YOU THAT THAT'S A VERY REASON BY I WILL SAY I'M- MORE WORRIED ABOUT WHY THEY- I AM ABOUT. THE OTHER AND F THERE'S A QUESTION AND WE HAVE TO DECIDE I'M GOING TO DECIDE AND I WOULD. URGE YOU DECIDE IN TERMS OF PREVENTING FIRES. WELL I WOULD NEVER SPEAK FOR- TOM PORTER AND CAL FIRE BUT THERE HAS BEEN GREAT ADVANCEMENT MADE. IN AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE IN THIS LAST FIRE SEASON. OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO WITH TECHNOLOGY THEY ARE GETTING VERY PRECISE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WEATHER CONDITIONS. WHAT FOLLOWED FIRE LOAD OR FIRE- VEGETATION LOAD- THEY HAVE GREAT MODELING IN PREVIOUS- WEATHER CONDITIONS FIRE CONDITIONS. AND CAL FIRES MAKING AS HIS KALLIO YES MAKING AND WE ARE TO WE ALL USE IN SOME OF THE SAME MODELING AND SOME- SOME OF THE GREAT TECHNOLOGY. I'M TECHNO SILVERS OF THE REALLY BECAUSE TO THIS WAY BUT IT THERE THERE TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN. REALLY PRECISE PEOPLE'S. OF EQUIPMENT UNDERSTANDING EVEN EVEN VERY QUICK CHANGES IN WEATHER GIVEN THE TOPOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT HAVE HAD PREVIOUS TOUGH FIRE SITUATIONS THIS IS ALL INFORMING ALL OF US WE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES. OF HOW BETTER PREPARE FOR FIRE PREVENT FIRE FIGHT FIRE. AND HOPEFULLY ADVISED US IN TERMS OF ANY POWER SHUT UP SO I THINK BOTH AREAS OF CONCERN. SHUTTING OFF THE POWER AND PREVENTING AND FIGHTING FIRES- WE'RE GETTING BETTER AND BETTER AT IT YOU SAW A BIG CHANGE JUST IN LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR AND HOW CALIFORNIA S. AND CAL FIRE. ON WORKED WITH WITH THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN THE AND THE FOR. AND PREVENTING OF FIRE SPREAD LASTLY I WANT TO GIVE MY COLLEAGUES A CHANCE TO ASK OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGH I COULD PROBABLY KEEP YOU HERE ALL DAY MY LAST QUESTION IS ON LOOKING AT THE MICRO GRANTS. I'D ASK YOU TO PRIORITIZE AREAS WHERE. WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE MICROGROOVE STARTING A FIRE SO WE HAVE TO TURN IT OFF TO. AND WORKING IN AREAS THAT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THOUGH SHUT OFF AND THEN MAKING SURE- AS HE SAID ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE MICRO GRANT- I'M SURE YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND THAT IS FOR ME A VERY HIGH PRIORITY THAT VERY MUCH OF A PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS. GREAT THANK YOU. DR THANK YOU. I AND THANK YOU ED FOR YOUR PRESENTE. AND THANK YOU I A START WORK SAID. THANK YOU FOR. TO THIS ON IT IS A- DEAL ANNA. AND MANY OF US ARE HAPPY TO SEE A WOMAN SITTING AT THE TABLE. EVERY SHADE THAT. A QUESTIONS ONE JUST A MINUTE AND IT'S A QUESTION I RAISED AS THE YEARS I'VE BEEN ON THIS. AND WE PEOPLE KEEP COMING WITH IDEA THAT GIVE THE P. THIS MORE AND MORE RESPONSIBILITIES. AS YOUR AFFECTING- IS YOUR ASSESSING YOUR ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE WITH THE CRISIS AT THAT ARE COMING AND I'LL SAY WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT FIGHTING WILDFIRES BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE OF THEM THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO. I MEAN. IT'S NOT THE MODEL WE WANT RIGHT. IT WILL YOU ALSO BE ASSESSING BREAKING IT UP OF BIT PER NOT TRYING TO HAVE THE SEE IF YOU SEE BE CHARGED EVERYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A REGULAR. ABOUT COMPARTMENT A SOME OF THE AROUND SAFETY AROUND TRY BUT WHAT IT IS TO THINKING ABOUT REACHED THE WAY THAT WE HAVE AND IT'S BEEN STRUCTURED IN THAT WE'D KEEP THROW MORE MORE MORE ON YOU AND THEN HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO BE REALLY GOOD EVERYTHING RIGHT IF EVERYTHING'S A PRIORITY NOTHING IS A PRIORITY THAT THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION WHEN I THINK OF YOU THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN- I'M THERE'S A LOT ON OUR PLAY RIGHT NOW AND ON MUCH OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE IMMEDIACY OF WHAT WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN MY TESTIMONY BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT WE HAVE WATER AND RAILROADS AND- UBER AND LIFT AND- MANY OTHER AREAS THAT ARE CRITICAL. MATTER JUST CRITICAL AND YOU'VE WELL STATED THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT THAT HAS BEEN ASSIGNED OVER THE YEARS TO THE PC I'M IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND I THINK SOME OF YOU. KNOW THAT ONE OF MY- ONE OF ACTIVITIES THAT I'VE WORKED HARD ON A PUBLIC SERVANT. IS TO BRING A MORE OF. NOT NECESSARILY A FISH BECAUSE I THINK THAT HAS A NEGATIVE. BUT MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT PROCESSES. AND MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS. HAVE SPECIFICALLY COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH AND COMMERCIAL WRECK SHAMAN HAVE TAKEN ON IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. A EFFORT TO REFORM OUR- MANY OF OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES SO I THINK WE NEED- TO LOOK AT HOW WE HOW WE DO OUR OWN BUSINESS IF YOU WELL I'D AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF BUSINESS RE ENGINEERING WHICH THEY HAVE. DONE ADMIRABLY AND- SO I WON'T I CAN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT WHAT I DO HOPE TO DO IS TO JOIN THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS OF MAKING OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE. NUMBER IF I MAY USE A WORD AGAIN THAT'S I THINK OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES AS I HAVE OUTLINED ALONG WITH THE BANKRUPTCY I WOULD HATE TO PLEDGE TO YOU. THIS YEAR. ON IN MY TERM- WHETHER I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE. REFORM THAT WOULD GO TO AN ABSOLUTE REORGANIZATION IN SOME CASES THAT MAY EVEN TAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE SO WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT BUT I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD START ON CLEANING UP. PRIORITIZING SOME REFORMS WITHIN OUR OWN PROCESSES AND THAT'S A MORE IMMEDIATE FOCUS FOR ME. OKAY AND THEN. MY NEXT I THINK IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THERE'S NOTHING MORE MOTIVATING I THINK IN THE WILD FIRES AND I HAVE FAMILY POINT MY MOTHER LIVES IN ORVILLE SO EVERY TIME THERE IS A HE SHUT DOWN I MEAN THEY ARE AFFECTED AND I HEAR ABOUT IT ANY WORK IN THE TIMBER INDUSTRY. SO I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT AS WE SO THEN MY GUESS MY OTHER POINT M. AND I'LL SAY BUT THE IT IT IS IT CREATES ANXIETY AS YOU WELL KNOW ALL ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT JUST PEOPLE LIVE IN FIRE. HI FIRE AREAS THE TREE DOWN TO EVERYBODY WORRYING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S US WE'RE ON OUR CHEN MY- MEAN WE- IT. THROUGH THE SUMMER I THINK ANY OF US TO A COMMUNITY MEETING TOWN HALL OF QUANTUM CLUB BUT WE WEREN'T ABOUT GINNY HOW FIRES AND ALMOST. THAT'S THE ENVY. YEAH NOT THE DAY OF EATING RISK THAT OFF LIST THANK. AT BUT THEN THE OTHER THING IN. WHEN WE'RE AT AND THEN I PARKED ON THIS ABOUT I ALSO CHAIR THE GUY WHO COMMITTEE AND I LIVE REPRESENT STOCKINGS JOAQUIN. AREABUT JUST THE ID OF OUR TECH. THAT ALSO TAKE CARE SOME OF OUR WASTE CAUSES OUR FIRE AND CONTRIBUTE THE DECLINE OUR AIR. ALL NEEDS TO BE A CAN. WE WANT TO IS CLEANER WE CAN. BUT WE NEED CLEAN UP OUR FOR AND WE NEED TO HAVE WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO THAT. BIOMASS BIO BECAUSE WHATEVER THAT IS AND FOREST AREAS AND ANY TO BE THE IN. AND TO BE ABLE TO THAT SO IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING AS MULTIPLE BEEN. AND I WE SHOULD AT IT WITH DIFFERENT LINE. WAS DRIVING OUT EAST OF STOCK. WE OUT TOWARDS LINDEN NEW VERY HIGH HEAVY. AND PEOPLE ARE OPEN BIRD RIGHT THEY HAVE NO OTHER. TO DO. A BREATHE RIGHT BECAUSE IT YOUR THE FOG HOLDING DOWN THERE PEOPLE ARE. IN THE FIELD BECAUSE I THE OPTION NAY A POINT. AT WHICH DOES NOT HELP US IN OUR GOALS SO JUST. YOU KNOW. I THE COMMONSENSE APPROACH AND HOPE SEE A WHOLE MORE OF IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK MISSION UP. I WANTED BOB ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH MA'AM QUIRK AND WITH MY EGGMAN OB A OF THE SIMILAR CONCERN OF MISTER IN A LOT OF THE SIMILAR OB TO AS- AG WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERT. OF THE WILD THE SHOT DOWNS ON MY DAUGHTERS IN LAW TWO OF OUR FOUR GRAND LIVE IN NORTH FOR. AS WE'VE HAD OUR SHARE OF THREE AND FOUR NIGHT IT'S WHEN THEY STAYED WITH US INSTEAD OF FOR DOWN THE VALLEY. BUT I WANTED IT. MAKE THIS UP AND ASK MAY BEFORE. A COMMENT BECAUSE. WE ARE WOULD WE ARE FOCUSED HERE ON G. H. OUR IMAGE IF YOU LOOK AT CHARTS BY CATEGORY AND ALL OF THAT. WHICH BASICALLY SAYS GHGS HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN. IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE EMISSIONS OF GHGS OF CARBON BY THE FOREST FIRES ARE NOT COUNTED. IT'S MY ESTIMATION THAT IF WE DID COUNT THE FOREST FIRES. WE WILL BE BLOWN A HOLE IN THESE MEGA EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO WE'RE BASICALLY PRETENDING. THAT WITH ALL OF THE DECISIONS ON ALL OF THE- RULES REGULATIONS AND THE BILLS PASSED ON ALL OF THAT. WHEN POINT OF FACT. THESE FOREST FIRES AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO GHG EMISSIONS IS SIMPLY BLOWN A HOLE. AT THE END AND I THINK- WE PROBABLY HAVE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS A NET INCREASE OF GHG EMISSIONS. IS THERE ANY EFFORT TO TRY AND TRACK AND SOMEHOW INTEGRATE INTO THESE. REDUCTIONS THE GHG EMISSIONS OF THESE POOREST BUYERS. I IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT QUESTION AN EXCELLENT POINT AND I HAVE SEEN STATISTICS WELL BEFORE I JOINED THE CPUC ABOUT WHAT THE FOUGHT WILD FIRES AND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN DID JUST TO THAT AND WHAT. IT ADDED TO- TO THE G. H. G. IN IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS TAKING SO MANY CARS OFF THE HIGHWAY OR BRINGING ON SO MANY ELECTRIC CARS DO YOU DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOME SPECIFICALLY. I WOULD I JUST GOT SAID THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION FOR THIS IS NOT THE DOCTOR BUT FOR A RESOURCE BOARD ON THE SLY THAT WE IF YOU'LL NOTE THE ARE ALL FOR THE AIR RE BOARD AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US UP ARE- TAIJI ACCOUNT SCIENCE. I DO KNOW THAT TRACKING THE WILD FIRED MISSIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER ONES IS NOT A STRICT ONE FOR ONE ANALYSIS- BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY OF THE FOREST TO BE A CARBON SINK ON IN BECAUSE THE TIMING IN WHICH THE FORESTRY GROWS AND IN WHICH IT WAS THE SAME TO START IT YOU HAVE TO DO A MUCH DEEPER ALICE SAID IF I GO FURTHER THAN THAT. YOUR I MEAN I SHOW THAT'S INTO MY NOW ON THAT OTHER THAN THE POINT BACK TO THE AIR BEES ON ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS WAS QUITE BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM AT ALL IN. IN THAT DAY WITH THEIR I THINK IT I TO SOME SOME IT INTERESTING IN HOW WE TO THE ONE FOR ONE OR THE COMPARISONS I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO LET YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT'S VERY I THINK IT'S REALLY. QUITE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. BE PRETENDING. AND QUITE FRANKLY THE- FIRES ARE IN. I THINK CONTRIBUTING SO. AT WE ARE RE. A PARTICULAR IN AGRA PART IN. AND ALL. THE ELECTRICITY RATES AND THE REGULATORY STUFF IS REALLY DRIVING COSTS UP IT'S QUITE FRANKLY DRIVING A LOT OF- ORGANIZATIONS OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE COST FACTOR IN ALL OF THAT. MY POINT IN THIS IS THAT. TO KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH- THE FOREST FIRES. PUSH THE G. H. G. UP. WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE IT I THINK BEGS THE QUESTION THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THE GHG FUNDS. THAT SO MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS OUGHT TO BE DEDICATED TO FORCE MANAGEMENT AND TO GETTING THESE FOREST'S- CLEANED UP SEND THE FUEL STE BROUGHT DOWN. AND I'M NOT IF I HAD MY WAY I'D DIED USE EVERY PENNY. QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS THE CHALLENGE NOT ONLY OF THE FOREST FIRES COST AND DANGER IT IS ALSO BASICALLY MASKING. ARE THE REAL. THAT HAVE BEEN THAT MADE AND CARBON. SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR THESE REDUCTIONS WHEN IN FACT WE SEE. ARE THAT THEY ARE EXPLODING. THAT'S TRUE WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON GAGE AND ASSESS IT. THEN WE CAN MAKE REALLY GOOD INFORMED DECISIONS WITH RESPECT OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH THESE GHG. FUNDS AND WHAT DO WE DO WITH THESE OTHER. ABILITY OF- BIOMASS IN THESE OTHER. KINDS OF SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT. APPRECIATE THAT WHATEVER YOU MIGHT HAVE SAY WITH. TO THAT OUT I KNOW THAT THEIR PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR. BUT CALIFORNIA DOES. ACCOUNT FOR A LOT OF THIS AND WE BELIEVE IT AS GOSPEL. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE CAN BELIEVE THAT WE'RE REDUCING GHG IF WE DON'T ACCOUNT FOR FOREST FIRES AND THAT'S GOING TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT GHG FUNDS THAT WE SPEND. I'M REMINDED THAT ARE WILDFIRES STRATEGIES AND CAROLINE CAN ADDRESSES TAKE IN TO ACCOUNT- CLIMATE GOALS WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES THE GHG. COUNTY ONE OF AND THEN SEAT ANYTHING FURTHER ON THAT SURE SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID RESEARCH ON OUR CURRENT STATE WAS AND WHAT BEST PRACTICES WERE ACROSS THE GLOBE ON UTILITY IGNITED WILD FIRE MITIGATION EFFORTS- AND DEVELOP THE NEW OUT FOR MITIGATION GUIDELINES A MATURITY MODEL WE ALSO STARTED DRAFTING OUT THE FOR- GOALS DRAFT GOALS FOR. HOW DO WE BALANCE THOSE COMPETING NEEDS SO WHAT WHAT ARE WE DRIVING TOWARDS AND WE CREATED A STEERING COMMITTEE TO INFORM ALL OF THAT WORK AND IT'S INCLUSIVE OF THE FOREST- MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THE ENERGYCOMMISSION CALLAWAY ASK CAL FIRE US- AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ALL OF THOSE DELIVERED OF DISCUSSIONS ARE HAPPENING. AT THAT LEVEL RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE OF HOW DO WE START THE BOUNCE THAT SO THAT WHEN WE COME OUT THE STRATEGY IN THE ROAD MAP THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME TARGETS WERE BACK IN THOSE DIFFERENT F. INCLUDING. THE IN TERMS OF HOW TO USE FILE TO. I'M YOU KNOW LEVERAGE ALL RESOURCES APPROACH. IT IN THE TO RID OF FIRE REST CAUSED BY. RECREO IF I DIE. BECAUSE OF YOUR AND YOUR NAME BUT THE DOCTOR WAS REALLY HAD A ON THIS TOP ON THIS PER. POINT WHEN IT YEAH SO THE EMISSION EACH YEAR ARE OF WHILE. ARE THE PEAK IT'S TYPICALLY AROUND TWO. ARE. WHAT IS IT MILLION YEAH MILLION METRIC TONS. ARE PEAK YEARS LIKE TWENTY OR FOR FIVE. UP FOR FIVE IS A WHAT THE ELECT SECTOR PRODUCE. AN IT'S ABOUT ONE TENTH OF THE TOTAL WE- SO THE TWO YOU. IT'S ABOUT FIVE PER OF GREEN GAS CHEN. AND TYPICALLY ABOUT HALF WHAT THE YOUTH GENERATE. WHICH IS A LOT FOR. THIS CARILLO YOUR YOUR NEXT AND SCORE SIERRA AND INVESTMENT RESEARCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF AND AGAIN WELCOME PRESIDENT BADGER AND YOUR TEAM FOR BEING WITH US- TODAY I TWO QUESTIONS ONE HAVING TO DO WITH THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM THE SECOND FOLLOWED BY A QUESTION RELATED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WHICH IS- MY PROVIDER AND A PORTION OF MY DISTRICT. BUT FIRST I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M EXCITED TO READ THE REPORT SB ONE HUNDRED PORT- THAT HE WILL PROVIDE TO US IN EARLY JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR YES WHICH WILL BE AROUND THE CORNER BEFORE WE KNOW IT- SOL STARTED BY SAY THAT SEVEN YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN BY THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER PARADE AT WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS CALLED FOR THE COMMISSION TO COMPLETE. A STUDY ON THAT ENERGY METERING OR ANY M. VISIT ANY OF OUR NAM AND ANY- OR NAM EITHER ANY I. YEAH RIGHT THE LAW ALSO WERE THE YOU SEE TO ENSURE THAT THE FULL OF SERVICE PROVIDE BY PROVIDED TO ANY AND CUSTOMERS ARE PAID BY THOSE CUSTOMERS AND THAT THE COSTS ARE NOT SHIFTED TO KNOCK ON ANY M. CUSTOMERS WHILE THE COMMISSION MADE SOME CHANGES. ANY AT PRO THEY ALSO COMMITTED TO RIVAS THIS IS LAST YEAR. AND TWENTY NINE WHICH HAS THE TO TAKE PLACE. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU PRESIDENT BADGERS GIVEN THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED TWO BILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE. KASHIF DISASSOCIATED WITH THE ANY AND PROGRAM WHAT IS THE COMMISSION'S PLAN FOR ADDRESSING. THIS ISSUE IN THE TIMELINE FOR OPENING A PROCEEDINGS AND ADDRESSING THAT SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFT ISSUE. I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RANDOLPH TO ANSWER THAT IF I MAY. BUT IN TERMS TO THE TIMING IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DATE- WHEN THE COMMISSION HAD- APPROVED WHAT WE CALLED IN AND TWO POINT NO- WHICH WAS IN RESPONSE TO. THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION IN SB THREE TWENTY SEVEN. WE HAD AND COME TO DO A REVIEW. OF THAT DECISION IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. BOB THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TIMING- WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT IN THAT SAME. SERIES OF DECISIONS THE COMMISSION HAD ALSO- DIRECTED THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO MOVE TO- PARADIGM OF TIME OF USE RATES FOR THE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS. AND WE THOUGHT THE BEST TIMING FROM BOTH THE CUSTOMER AND TAX AND POINT IN AND- ANALYTICAL STANDPOINT WAS TO LET THE TIME OF USE RATES ROLL OUT FOR. UNDER THE IMPACT OF THE THEN REVISIT NET ENERGY METERING AND THAT THAT'S VERY FOR AN AND STAY. BECAUSE COST SHIFT THAT YOU REFERENCED WHICH THAT NUMBERS FROM- GOV FAIRLY OLD STUDY- WITH BASED ON THE OLD RATE STRUCTURE- IN THAT RATE STRUCTURE WILL CHANGE. IN THE COST IMPACTS OF KNIT OF NET ENERGY METERING WILL CHANGE WHEN CUSTOMERS MOVE FROM- A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE WHICH THEY WERE ON TO THE TIME OF USE RATE STRUCTURE. WHAT'S HAPPENED BOB WELL SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS SEND YOUR GAS ELECTRIC IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THAT TIME OF USE RATES- THE OTHER TWO WERE DELAYED- BECAUSE THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE NEEDED- TO PROVIDE GOOD BILL INFORMATION TO THE CUSTOMER'S. EXPRESSION THAT FIRST YEAR BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO SHADOW BUILDING WHERE EACH MONTH YOU'RE GOING TO KNOW WHAT YOUR BILL IS ON TIME OF USE RATES AND THEN YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT IT IS ON THE OLD RATE STRUCTURE. AND AT THE END OF THAT FIRST YEAR IF YOUR RATES WOULD HAVE BEEN LOWER ON THE OLD RATE STRUCTURE GOING TO BE REFUNDED THE DIFFERENCE I'M ALL THAT REQUIRES. FAIRLY UP TO DATE CAN JUST SO THE SAN DIEGO IS READY TO GO THE OTHER. UTILITIES NEED TO UPGRADE THEIR- OVERALL FOR A BUNCH OF REASONS- THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. I'M IN SO WE DECIDED THE WISE THING TO DO WAS TO WAIT UNTIL THOSE UPGRADES ARE IN PLACE. BEFORE THEY ROLL OUT THEIR TIME OF USE RATES ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT'LL HAPPEN WITH P. JEANNIE EACH CUSTOMER'S. STARTING THIS FALL. AND THEN IT WILL HAPPEN- WITH A SMALL SEGMENT OF EDISON CUSTOMERS ALSO STARTING THIS FALL. AND THEN THEY HAVE ACTUALLY REQUESTED A ANOTHER DELAY FOR I BELIEVE NINE MONTHS- DUE TO SOME ISSUES WITH- THERE- UPGRADES OF THEIR- BACK OFFICE SYSTEMS. BOB I. WOULDN'T SAY ONCE THAT'S DONE WE WILL START THE. HEY WE DON'T CALL HIM POINT OH BUT FOR ONE OF A BETTER TERM. THE NAMES POINT NO PROB WE ARE WAIT THEN WE WERE ALREADY HAVE GONE OUT OF COMMON. ON WHAT SCOPE- COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SHOULD LOOK AT- FOR THIS NEXT STUDY SO WE'RE STARTING TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THAT THE NEXT PROCESS- BUT THE TIMING OF THAT IS GOING TO PROBABLY BE TIED TO SOME EXTENT- TO WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TIME OF USE RATES. THANK YOU ARE IT'S ALWAYS INTEREST TO THE- THINK ABOUT IT THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS GIVEN THE- TECHNOLOGY IS PRETTY MUCH INVENTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YET WE HAVE. UTILITIES THE. ARE WE TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET UP TO DATE I'LL BE BLUNT. IT FEELS SOMETIMES LIKE SOME OF THE UTILITIES COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE STILL ALL OPERATED ON PNEUMATIC TUBES AND DURABLES RUNNING ON WHEELS- THERE IN THE STORE NEED MASSIVE UPGRADES SO THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO BE HAVING AS THE BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE AS TO HOW WE GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO THAT OF A CRITICAL PART OF THE CONVERSATION EXCELLENT. I ALSO SAW THAT IN THE IN THE SITUATION THIS FALL WITH P. JEANNIE. RIGHT WHEN COME. ABSOLUTELY CRAP. WELL SYSTEMS PRESIDENT BETTER I AM NEW MEMBER TO ASSEMBLY STARTING MY THIRD YEAR. AND YOUR NEW TO YOUR PER. SO I. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING TO YOU AND YOUR- FOR THE P. YOU SEE SO THAT WE CAN WORK TO OUR A ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT ARE MOST CRITICAL ALL CAL. SO MY SECOND QUESTION IS RELATED TO SOMETHING EDISON WHICH PROPOSED AN INVEST OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILD FIRE RISK MITIGATION MEASURES AND CLAIMS THAT APPROVAL OF THIS REQUEST WILL HELP ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S. INCREASE IN VIRUS BY FURTHER HARDENING THEY GOT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ENHANCING UTILITY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. IN JULY. PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS SUBMITTED UPPER. SO TO A THE APPLICATION WITH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COST RECOVERY METRICS REPORTING. ANOTHER RATE PAYER PROTECTIONS THE OFFICE OF SAFETY ADVOCATES OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL SETTLEMENT. THE P. UC CONTINUES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL SETTLEMENT AND MODIFICATIONS RECOMMENDED BY OSA. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT SOME ACTION FROM THE COMMISSION ON THE GREAT SAFETY AND RECENTLY PROGRAM SETTLEMENT. ON THE SETTLEMENT I DON'T KNOW A THE TIME OF THAT IS TO YOU OR BOB. ON WELL AWARE OF THAT A WITH ENERGY DIVISION ON WHY AWARE OF IT'S BUT IT'S THERE FOR A WHILE THE UTILITY IS ALLOWED TO TRACTORS COSTS IN WHAT'S CALLED A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT- SO IF THE YOU COMMISSION ULTIMATELY DETERMINES THAT THERE'S A REGIONAL COSTS OR COVER THEM- AND WE ARE AT THIS POINT- TRYING TO. ADD HAD SEPARATE PRIORITIZED AND KIND OF WORK THROUGH WATER THE CRITICAL DECISIONS WE NEED TO DO ON EACH ONE- I CAN REPORT BACK- ON WHAT WE THINK THE EXPECTED TIME MINUTES AT THIS POINT AND ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M I'M AWARE OF IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO GET. HIGHER ON THE LIST AND WE'LL BE HAPPY. TO REPORT BACK. TO YOU. NOW THANK YOU. GARCIA I THANK YOU SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT A THIS ARE ON WILD AND RIGHTFULLY SO AND IN THIS AND IN THE CAPITALIST MENISCUS FROM OLD YEARS BUT THE C. PIECE HAS A LOT MORE THAN YOU HAVE TO ON RIGHT IT'S PART OF THE OF WITH MISSED A MAY WAS REMINDING US ABOUT INSULT TO ME P. FIVE. I ONLY HAVE. YOU BILL ABOUT SAILOR YEAR ASKING YOU TO TASK. AND TO DISCLOSE AND- QUALIFY IN THE BILL WE HOPE TO IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW THEY TAKING THIS TO CLEAN IT UP. I TO ENSURE THAT FOREVER THIS STAND A WATER SOME KEEP RECORD. SAFE OUT THERE AND SO THE WHY BOARD IS WORKING ON THE FROM FOSSEN THERE'S AN OVER THIRTY BETWEEN THE BOARD TO WORK AND THIS. ON AND SO I YOUR UP WHEN THEY'RE ANY IT HAD A- TO LOOK INTO AND WHAT TYPE OF. YOUR DOING WHAT THE WATER ON THIS ISSUE. SINCE AN OVERLY BETWEEN THIS. AND THE WATER BOARD THERE. ARE YOU CAUGHT ME TOTALLY BUT A I DO KNOW ANYTHING OF THAT SO. I'M SO SORRY AND I. CAN THAT. YEAH NOT SO IN IT MAY I A GET A- MANY WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU I'M NOT GOING TO BE UPSET THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A- OF IT TO DAVE I GUESS. WE CAN WIN FOR LOOK AND THAT AND- INSURING FROM THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY ARE SAY I HAVE COMMUNITY WHERE EVERY SINGLE AS CAN. WITH THIS FOREVER WHICH MEANS THAT I NEVER BREAKS DOWN AND IT'S CAN OF YOU KNOW THAT IS CARCINOGEN AT DID A HAVE THE UP TO STERN THE WALL GO TO ANOTHER WELL. AND SO WE DO HAVE YOU. THAT ARE TRYING TO RESPONSE. IN THE AREA BUT THEIR TRANSFER HOW DO PAY FOR THIS AND WHAT DO AND YOU KNOW I NINE THAT THEY'VE IN LIKE TO SEE. AND SAYS FROM EVERYTHING MAKING SURE THE WHILE WE'RE DO THEM WORK ON WILDFIRES WE DON'T FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DOING. STUFF TIED TO P. FIVE ABS IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW THIS OF. HAS A OR A HUNDRED. SO I'M- I'M WELL AWARE AND CONCERNED AS A FELLOW CALIFORNIAN. OF THE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE. OF MANY OF OUR OUR- QUALITY WATER AND LESS THAN SYSTEMS SO. WE WILL LOOK INTO THIS AND GET BACK AND I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT. IT TOOK A AND SO I MEAN AND THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC BUT JUST IN GENERAL AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT REFORMS THAT MAYBE HE DID NOW INTERNALLY RIGHT AS YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE- WELFARE CRISIS AT THE SAME TIME- THAT WE LOOK AT HOW WE COULD BE- I THINK YOU SAID MORE EFFECTIVE. IN OUR COORDINATION A MORE NIMBLE AND ACCORDING SEEN WITH OTHER AGENCIES. SO THAT WERE NOT BEING DUPLICATIVE US SO THAT WE- SO THAT WE AGENCIES AREN'T WORKING- IN AN A- IN. IN THEIR OWN LITTLE SILOS SILO RIGHT IN AND THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING. RESOURCES WHAT THE HUMAN CAPITAL BUT AND DOLLARS OUT THERE SO I COULDN'T THANK YOU AND- I WILL BE PATIENT APPRECIATE- NEED YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. THANK YOU. YOU SOMERS WHICH- THE THANK YOU. WELCOME HI WHAT'S ON MY CALLER AND WELCOMING YEAH YOU AND YOUR TEAM- LIKE THE- REST MY COLLEAGUES- WILD FIRES- HAS. DOMINATED MY- ATTENTION ESPECIALLY DURING THE FALL BUT EVEN THOUGH I REPRESENT TO. THE SOUTH BAY AREA OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY- EDISON TERRITORY- I WAS FOLLOWING AND HEARING FROM MY COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF- THE- THE BLACKOUTS AND I AND SO WHEN I CAME BACK HERE IN JANUARY I EXPECTED TO SEE AND HEAR OF A SLEW OF BILLS. YOU KNOW TO PROPOSAL- A WIDE RANGE OF- OF MEASURES TARGETING P. GINNY ARM YOU KNOW ANYTHING FROM A STATE TAKEOVER OF PIGEON TO- THE- PIECEMEAL MINUTES MINUTES BILL IS A SIN OF A OF A OF A OF UTILITIES TO- YOU KNOW EVEN MORE TARGETED- PROPOSALS LIKE PUBLIC- TAKEOVERS OVER OVER THAT THE TRANSMISSION LINES- AND SO FORTH BUT- IT COULD YOU GET A GIVE AN OVERVIEW AS TO. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT CONVERSATIONS THEY THEY THE PC HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IN A TO DATE IN TERMS OF. OF EXPLORING OPTIONS FOR PUBLIC ALTERNATIVES TO THE P. JEANNIE. ARE I MENTIONED GIVEN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND ALL THAT'S GOING ON I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND. NON IF YOU MAY BE CONSTRAINED FROM. FROM OPENLY SPECULATING BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU IF YOU CAN GIVE US A SENSE AS TO WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THE PC HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IN TERMS OF EXPLORING PUBLIC ON ALTERNATIVES TO P. JEANNIE I YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT SIR I CANNOT SPECULATE ON IT AS A VOTING MEMBER OF THE PC I DO KNOW THAT- STAFF HAS MET WITH SOME OF THE- DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE IDEAS AND HAVE PLANS- ADD YOU CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THIS- WE CAN'T GO INTO GREAT DETAIL. BUT PROBABLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN EXPRESS IS WHAT YOU'VE PROBABLY READ IN THE IN THE PRESS FRANKLY BUT- YEAH I MEAN IT JUST. I MEAN WHAT'S IN THE PRESS IS WHAT I KNOW AS WELL AS THERE'S BEEN VARIOUS PROPOSALS OUT THERE FROM VARIOUS FOLKS- FOR EITHER YOU KNOW MISSILES ATION OF THE ENTIRE UTILITY OBVIOUSLY SITTING COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AND SOME OTHER LOOK AT LOCALITIES WOULD LIKE TO- BY THE UTILITY SERVICES THERE- YOU KNOW I THINK THE P. UC'S ROLE OR NOT I THINK WITH UC'S ROLE WITHIN ALL OF THAT. I A IS CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE IN IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON. THE MECHANISM IN WHICH THEY FOLLOW SO OUR ROLE WOULD BE TO BE AN ADVOCATE FOR OR AGAINST IT WOULD BE TO FOLLOW THE STATUTORY GUIDELINES- WHICH GENERALLY ARE SET UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT BEHIND ARE PROTECTED. SO THAT'S BEEN OUR CONVERSATIONS ALONG THE WAY IS TO PROVIDE- PARTIES THAT HAVE PROPOSALS OUT THERE- THE ROAD MAPS THEY WOULD NEED TO FOLLOW. UP OKAY. I CAN RECALL I BELIEVE OUR FIRST HEARING THE LAST YEAR- WAS WITH YOUR PREDECESSOR AND- I REMEMBER REMEMBER ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS THAT AND THAT I- WALKED AWAY FROM THE HEARING WAS TO. IS SAYS STATEMENTS- DESCRIBING HOW WOEFULLY- UNDER. RESOURCE THE PC IS IN AND IN TERMS OF ITS- WHAT FIRE SAFETY OF ENFORCEMENT. EFFORTS COULD YOU SHARE WITH US YOUR YOUR OPINION AS TO. WHETHER THEY ARE THE WILD FIRES- SAFETY DIVISION- IS- HAS AN ANSWER RESOURCES TO WELL M. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TEN FIFTY FOUR AND- ONE ELEVEN LAST SUMMER THE TRAILER BILL- THE WELFARE SAFETY DIVISION WAS ESTABLISHED AND INDEED THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET APPROPRIATED EACH WITH WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE LEGISLATION IT WAS APPROPRIATED- THAT IT WOULD BE STAFFED WITH APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STAFFWHICH CAROLINE HAS BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TO REALLY RECRUIT TERRIFIC PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WILL HAS ALSO ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED AND AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY JUST MET FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY I FEEL THAT IN THE DIVISION. WE ARE ADEQUATELY RESOURCE WE ALSO IN THE CURRENT BUDGET HAVE- PROPOSED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR OUR SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WHICH I THINK PRESIDENT PICKER WAS PROBABLY ALSO REFERRING TO IN HIS TESTIMONY SO WE DO HAVE ON. IT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OUR BUDGET IS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW FOR APPROVAL. SO I THINK OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WILL WERE WELL ACCEPTED AND I THINK WELL STAFFED AND ARE ASKING FOR AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED. ALL RIGHT THERE'S NO ENOUGH FREEZER IT IN NO YOU'LL HEAR THAT FROM EVERY AGENCY IN GOVERNMENT SURE. OKAY. MOVING ON TO THE PS PS ARM. I THINK UGH- MISTER QUIRK- THANK GOD FOR. THE FEWER WILD FIRES THAT WE HAD TO THE THAT THIS FALL BUT TO. THE TWO TO WHAT EXTENT- WHERE THE P. S. P. S. WAS THE PS PS- GOT A PROGRAM- YEAH- KOENIG CLAIM CREDIT FOR THE FEAR WHAT FIRES. CAN I I'M SORRY IT CAN PLAGUE CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THAT WHAT TO WHAT EXTENT- DID THE P. S. P. S. BLACKOUTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEAR Y. FOUGHT WILD FIRES FEW AROUND CLASS YES SIR- I WOULD REALLY WANT THAT THAT QUESTION IS BETTER POST I THINK TO THE I. O. U.'S. BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAD- REPORTS TO US THAT THEY THEY HAD POSSIBLE IGNITION SITES THAT DID NOT IGNITE. AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE STATISTICS RIGHT NOW BUT EACH ONE OF THE I A IS- SHOWED SIGNS. WHERE AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED WHEN DRYNESS FUEL LOAD AND ON TURNING OFF THE POWER. HOWEVER THERE WAS THERE THERE'S ALSO CONCERNED THAT IN PERHAPS ONE CASE THAT THE POWER WASN'T TURNED OUT- IN IN A TIMELY MANNER SO. I THERE THERE ARE REPORTS THAT. THE P. S. P. S. DID. AND LEMONADE SOME OF THE IGNITION SITES BUT THAT STILL IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE PC I'M JUST BASICALLY SAYING WHAT'S IN THE PUBLIC. AND THE PUBLIC INFORMATION OKAY. ALL RIGHT TO LAST BUT NOT LEAST- I REPRESENT THE CITY OF REDONDO BEACH YES THE SIDE OF- ONE OF THE ONES THROUGH COALINGA. POWER PLANTS. AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THEM THE MAYOR OF REDONDO BEACH WHO TESTIFIED AT THE PC HIS HEARING HE'S BEEN EXCELLENT IN IN- IN HIS TESTIMONY AND THE INFORMATION HE IS BROUGHT TO US EIGHT HE'S A HE'S A TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR HIS- HIS COMMUNITY AND I SHARE HIS- HIT HIS PASSION- AND HIS COMMITMENT TO WANT TO. SHUT DOWN THE REDONDO BEACH POWER PLANT- YOU KNOW A FROM THE COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVE- THAT THAT THIS POWER PLANT- YOU KNOW HAS BEEN PLANTED SHUT DOWN I BELIEVE FOR AT AT AT LEAST A- THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND THEY THEY COMMITTEE FEELS LIKE IT'S- GOT THE ROCK. PULLED UP UNDER ITS FEED WENT. IN NOT ONLY PLANNING FOR THE SHUTDOWN OF THE POWER PLANT BUT WE HAD IN FACT TO SECURED TO ALMOST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS TO. TO RESTORE- THE ORIGINAL WEB- AT THE SIDE OF THE PLANT. YEAH AND- MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IT- AT THIS POINT IS A- THE AT THAT DECISION- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING- NEEDS TO BE FINALIZED WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. ARE IF THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. DENIES THE OR A DEAD I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE PROCEDURAL TERM IT WOULD BE BUT BASICALLY TURNS DOWN THE- THE EFFORT TO EXTEND THE WAS THROUGH CALLING OPERATION AT THE REALITIES PLANT. WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON. GRID RELIABILITY. YEAH I'M A I'M TRYING TO ADD WHO HAS BEEN A LOT OF THE ON THIS I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME OF THIS AND I DO WANT TO START OUT WITH SAYING THAT THE- I KNOW THE COMMISSIONERS DID NOT TAKE EXTENT OF MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION OR BOARD TO EXTEND OUR THE CIRCLE PLANE A CALM EXPRESSION BATES LIGHTLY AND LOOK FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. THE GOOD NEWS ELEMENT THERE IS AN E. S. NIGHT CITY OF OXNARD ACTION OF UP TO SUPPORT A PLAN IN THEIR COMMUNITY ARE POTENTIALLY STAYING OPEN AND I THE LONG. RANGE FOR THE OPERATOR OF THAT PLANT ON ON PAGE INTO A MITIGATION FUND REMOVE THAT PLAN LIKE A RED DOT BEACH. THERE IS NO. FOR THE ACT DEACON. I'M AND- I'M SO IF WATER BOWL WERE. EVEN NOT PLANT OPEN AND IN ADDITION YEAR OR TWO YEARS THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR REDONDO BEACH IN YOUR TO DO YOU SEE IT RECOMMENDED LEAVING REDONDO BEACH AND FOR TWO MORE YEARS. IT IS DEAD IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BOND IF THE WATER BOARD WORD TO DENY THAT- AT THAT POINT IN TIME I DON'T. THINK THERE'S A VOTE DOUBLE PLAN B. THAT WOULD GIVE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY STATE AS A WHOLE- THE RELIABILITY THEY- IT IF. EXTREME PEAK A YEAH. AND THE AND THAT'S- THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THE AND OUT THIS IS GOT THERE'S GONNA THERE'S NOT- UNTIL THE NEW SOURCES ARE BUILT IN BOB THERE'S NOT A OPTION THERE- WHAT I SAY IS COMMISSION. I'M IS VERY IT TOO AND TO GETTING THESE PLANTS SHUT DOWN AS SOON AS PART FALL- IF. THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO GET MORE RESOURCES ONLINE SOONER- WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW THESE PLANTS ARE NOT NEEDED ANYMORE AND THEY CAN BE CLOSER. ALL RIGHT. UP THERE HAD A QUESTION BUT- WAS GRILL IS PURE. ASKING A QUESTION ON THIS PARTICULAR.

IN THE VERY INTERESTED IN GOING ON OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND TWO ALL OF THE SUBJECTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY. YOU WERE TALKING RAPE TALKING KEEPING UP LOW AND IF. FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND I'M I'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS UP. IT IS IN THAT LOOK AT TYPE OF WORK IT'S BEEN DONE THERE. LOOK AT EVERYTHING FROM INVEST INTO IN FOR.

STIR SANTIAGO WHO IS THE CHAIR OF A COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE AND- IT BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE AND BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO IN THE REPORT- TOUCHING ON VARIOUS SECTORS OF WHAT THE PC IS OUR TOLL AND HAS- HAD PROCEEDINGS AND ISSUES IN ADDRESS IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT. GOING ON. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE TO FINALLY DEFINING JURISDICTION I THINK TODAY BUT CERTAINLY AS RELATES TO ANYTHING INDICATIONS WERE MISTER SANTIAGO AND HIS LEADERSHIP THERE BUT- WE'RE NOW NOT LEAD TO THE APPROPRIATE. IN IN RESPECT TO THE COMMITTEE SO BUT WHAT WOULD I DO WANT TO GET BACK TO THE NAM PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY I'D BEEN SOMEBODY WHO PORT- ROOFTOP SOLAR. ENERGY AND ALL THAT TO MAKE OUR MUCH BETTER BUT BUT THERE IS THAT ONE IN I MEAN TO BE THE HORSE. PRESIDENT WELCOME THE DECISION. IS A- AT THE BILLION DOLLAR CO SHIFTING AND I. THE SECOND JUST CHECKING THE STATUS. I'M NOT ALL OF IT IS COVERED- UNDER UNDER- FOR MOST OF US PUBLIC UTILITIES SMALL PORTION OF IT WHICH IS THE CITY HUNTING PARK ABOUT HAS TO BE. THAT ALSO HAS TO BE WITH THE POOR THERE'S A PERCENT AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAUTIOUS TO ME THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY- IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND I KNOW YOU YOUR NEW POSITION. UP BUT AT. BUT THOSE. OKAY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED YET IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE INTO THE- NINE. WHEN WITH THE URGENT NEED- THE BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE- THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. IS THERE ANY SORT OF COMMITMENT THAT YOU CAN GIVE US THAT IS GOING TO. ADDRESS THAT ISSUE GIPSON NUMBER- BECAUSE WE NEED IF. BEFORE YOUR TIME EIGHT EIGHT FAILED TO MEET ITS FIRST DEADLINE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- AND SO WE'RE NOW SEE HERE TWENTY TWENTY- WRAPPED CAN HIDE. ACOSTA HEALTH THERE IS A- INCREASING TUITION I GET ANY BETTER I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON AND MY DISTRICT FELL FROM THE- THIRD. DISTRICT THE SECOND DISTRICT. I GOT A MASTERS ARE FOLKS RIGHT. AND WHAT IS AN ANSWER COSTS. IN YOU'D BE ABLE. THAT. I JUNE. IS ABOUT BY THE END. ARE WE GONNA. ON ANOTHER YEAR. WELL I. WE WERE. TALKING ABOUT THIS. YEAH ARE EARLIER AND I DON'T KNOW TO CAN EXPAND MORE ON THAT THE TERM OF TIME FOR MY- PLAN TO STAY. OF CUTS FRUSTRATION. SORRY I UNDERSTAND YOU CONCERN AND FRUSTRATE I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RANDOLPH DISK IT'S SERIES OF EVENTS THAT WERE GOING THROUGH OUR PROCEEDINGS IF YOU WILL AND WITH WITH THE TIME OF USE AS WELL AS WITH. I'M ED CAN I SUPPOSE ANYONE ON ANY OTHER TIME FRAMES THAT WE OULD HELP- MISTER SANTIAGO WITH. THE BIGGEST COMMITMENT IS WERE START- AND YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING INTO THE BIGGEST COMMITMENT IS WE ARE STARTING THE PROCESS AS I SAID I KIND OF GLOSSED OVER. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE INITIAL- COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS- THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO MAKE THE NEXT DECISION AS I SAID BEFORE THAT- THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR COST SHIP NUMBER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS BASED ON A STUDY WITH BET ON IT ALL BREAK. NOW THAT WOULD. BE NEW RAGE. REFRESH SEVEN MY THINK THAT NUMB ACTUALLY UP BEING LOWER BY ALL ON THE FLIP SO THINK THAT OLD STUDY YOU COULD LOOK AT IT IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT WAYS AND HOW YOU DEFINE SHIFT I THINK GOING FORWARD WILL BE CLEARER- BUT THAT YOU KNOW WHO'S BENEFITING WHO'S NOT WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO THE DESIGN A NEW PROGRAM- COULD WE GET SOMETHING DONE BY JUNE CAN WE- BE. THE WELL THE ARE WAY TO MAKE IT THIS. EARLY NEXT YEAR- I THINK THAT'S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY HOPING FOR. HIS OWN REASONS AYE AYE MA'AM MISTER. IS ONE OF THE REASONS I ASKING I'M- ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT. BUT IF THE FOLKS IN MY EAR I CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND DON'T HAVE IT. WHAT'S THE COST TO THEM WHAT MANY IN IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE OTHER SIDE REMEMBER THAT THE SOLAR PROGRAMS- USED TO HAVE TWO PARTS TO IT. THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE WHICH WAS A STRAIGHT GRANT REBATE PROGRAM- FOR PEOPLE PUT IN POPLAR ROOTS THEN THERE'S THE NET ENERGY MERELY PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO STICK TO SELL BACK THE SOLAR THAT SEAT PROGRAM IS BY AND LARGE EXPIRED. BUT IN THE INTERIM WITH THE PC HAS IS ALMOST ALL MONEY THAT'S GOING OUT AND BE SORT OF GRANT FOR REBATE FORM I DOUBT GRAHAM OKAY STAND TYRONE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ENTIRELY ON PEOPLE LOW INCOME- HOUSING EITHER SINGLE FAMILY OR MULTI FAMILY. COMMISSIONER ARE PER NOT SURE AND MITCH A HIGH MILLION. YOU MONEY GOING TO THE SUBJECT RATIONS AT THE PROGRAM ON- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS SO THE PROBE. IS NOW ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE- EARLY IN THE PROGRAM. WELL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK FROM THEN SOME OF THE NUMBERS- IF I'M PROVEN WRONG I WILL ADMIT BUT I'D BE WILLING TO BET MOST OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. DON'T HAVE A- I'D I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS ARE GETTING STARTED OUT- NOW WINNER I HIGHLY FOCUSED ON THE NOW. A LOT OF CREDIT- COMMISSIONER MARK THE GOOD SEVEN AS- TIRELESSLY NOW THAT I CAN I CAN ATTEST TO THIS BECAUSE- I GET A CALL FROM. ALMOST DAILY ON CAN YOU MOVE THIS QUICKER CAN YOU MOVE THIS QUICKER HAS GOTTEN THE COMMISSION LIGHTNING FOCUSED ON- THESE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND- CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS. MAY I ASK THE CHAIR. AND MAY CONTINUE TO CHAIR. YES I JUST WANT TO AND I APPRECIATE YOU AND WE WERE GIVING EVERYONE A CHANCE TO SORT OF FLUSH OUT THERE THINKING ON IT I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO- MOVE TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER AT- FOR QUICKLY AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT SO BY ALL MEANS IF IT'S A QUICK WELL AS ONE IN BY THINKING YOU'VE FRANCE OF THE QUESTIONS AND WELCOME YOUR POST AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK. BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE AN IDEA OF WHY IT'S POINT TO ME WHY THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY- TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE- BECAUSE- WE NEED. WE YOU'RE NEW TO THE POSITION BUT- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS CRISIS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. MISSED THE FIRST DEADLINE IN NINETEEN. WE DON'T WANT TO MISS TWENTY. AND THEN HIT TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS. I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST. BAG THE MAYBE WE COME UP WITH A WITH A REAL HARD DEADLINE WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT DEADLINES IS YOU KNOW. IF YOU DON'T SET A DEADLINE KNOWS GONNA MEET. AND SO I AM HOPING THAT SOME POINT COMPENSATOR STAIRS THE DEADLINE TO MEET URGENCY AND I APPRECIATE IT GREATLY- AND I WILL TAKE THAT BACK TO MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND IF THERE IS MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO KEEP YOU INFORMED. AT TO ME. GO THROUGH THESE PROCEEDINGS WE WILL ABSOLUTELY DO THAT HAPPY TO DO IT. BUT I DO HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF URGENCY AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M I JUST WANT TO ASK A REAL QUICK QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO THIS NEW SAFETY BOARD- ESTABLISHED UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR AND- RECOGNIZING THAT OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL WAS TO ENSURE- A MORE. NIMBLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF SAFETY AND ALSO CREATING AN AVENUE A PATHWAY FOR A MENISCAL ON UTILITIES TO ALSO HAVE THEIR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS EVALUATED AND ONE. STOP PROCESS OF THE WELFARESAFETY BOARD I BELIEVE HAD ITS FIRST MEETING THIS WEEK YESTERDAY YESTERDAY AND SO THE SO A LOT OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING YOU'RE IN THE POSITION YOUR AND- THERE'S CLEARLY TRANSITION HAPPEN IN TERMS OF MOVING THE- ELECTRIC GRID DIVISION- SAFETY AREA OUT OF THE PC AND INTO. A RESOURCE AGENCY THE QUESTION GIVEN DISCUSSION TODAY AND AS WE KNOW TO BE THE CASE. THE WORKLOAD USE THE AS IT RELATES. VARIOUS ISSUES DO YOU THINK THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO MOVE ALL GAS- SAFETY AND ALSO ALL THE UTILITY OR ARE I SHOULD SAY- ELECTRIC SAFETY WORK. INTO THE NEW DIVISION- AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IT'S- THEY'RE STILLKIND OF A SEPARATION SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. BECAUSE TAX UP THE WOULD BE. APPROPRIATE TO TRANSITION ALL SAFETY RELATED ACTIVITIES AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD REALLY HAVE TO STUDY THAT- I HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF. SEVERAL REORGANIZATION PLANS AND STATE GOVERNMENT. MIGHT STIRRED UP THE DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA AND TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WITHIN TWO WEEKS OUT OF B. O. E. CREATED THE OFFICE TAX APPEALS WITHIN SIX MONTHS I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO DO TRANSITIONS AND REORGANIZATIONS. AND FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT ONE HAS TO DO A REAL EVALUATION OF WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE WHAT WHAT WILL MAKE IT BETTER WHAT FUNCTIONS GOVERNMENT WILL BE MADE BETTER BY THAT REORGANIZATION OR THAT RESTRUCTURING. AND THEN WHAT DISRUPTION WILL OCCUR TO THE CONSUMER. TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE EMPLOYEE IS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS- SO YOU WANT TO AGAIN LOOK TOWARD GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS NUMBER ONE. AND THEN HOW DO YOU APPROACH IT WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DISLOCATION AND DISRUPTION FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE THAT YOU ARE CHARGED TO PROVIDE. SO THOSE WOULD BE GUIDEPOSTS FOR ME IN LOOKING AT NOT. ON I ALSO. THE MOVING OF A DIVISION FROM ONE- UNDER ONE UMBRELLA ONE AGENCY TO ANOTHER ONE IS NOT A SMALL FEET EITHER. I'M JUST JUST SIMPLE BUREAUCRATIC STUFF THAT I CAN MENTION THAT IS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED IS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION LIKE SO MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS WHICH- IN MY OTHER JOB I TRIED TO CHANGE- AND ARE STILL SERVICE IMPROVE. WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIAL CLASSIFICATIONS SO OUR PAY SCALES ARE DIFFERENT OUR CAREER LADDERS ARE DIFFERENT OUR- RESPONSIBILITY JOB JOB DUTIES ARE DIFFERENT. AND MOVING. THE FOLKS THAT ARE HIRED UNDER THE UNDER A P. YOU SEE CLASSIFICATION INTO A NEW ORGANIZATION CAN BE DONE IT WILL BE DONE IT'S NOT DONE EASILY BECAUSE IT SCREWS UP FOULS UP THE LADDERS AND- LETTERS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THAT'S JUST WONKY CIVIL SERVICE STUFF WHICH I WISH I WOULD COULD HAVE SAT WITH FOLKS AND TALKED ABOUT THAT. A YEAR AGO NOW ON. BUT ANY RATE I WOULD REALLY SERIOUSLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE WERE IMPROVING AND HOW WE WERE IMPROVING IT. UNDER REORGANISE IT IDEA. AND WHAT WOULD BE THE BENEFIT IN TERMS OF REALLY SAFETY THE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING THINGS SAFER WHETHER IT'S GAS ELECTRICITY- MILD HER MEDICATION. ON AND WHERE TO WHERE TO MOVE IT IS RESOURCE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO MOVE GAS SAFETY. IS RESOURCES THE RIGHT PLACE TO MOVE. RAILROAD SAFETY OR SOME OTHER PART OF THE SAFETY RUBRIC THAT THE UC- IS IN CHARGE WITH I DON'T KNOW MADE A STANDALONE ORGANIZATION THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY INTO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION KIND OF. THIS THING TO CONSIDER I'D REALLY NEED TO THINK I WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU DON'T DO REORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT LIGHTLY ON. WHEN IT'S BEEN DONE LIGHTLY OR POORLY WHETHER IT'S BEEN DONE BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH UNDER THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. PROCESS IT'S DIFFICULT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE OF AS I SAID THE IMPACTS TO THE PEOPLE WE SERVER TO MIGHT AND IMPACTS TO INPUT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IS CAN BE TOUGH TO. WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR- RESPONSE- IT CLEARLY WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. SOLUTIONS TO COMPLICATED PROBLEMS WHERE THERE ARE THINGS MOVING UNDER OUR FEET YEAH- SO UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU WILL IT'S EASIER TO SORT OF FIGURE IT OUT AND THAT'S IDEAL AND I KNOW THAT THINGS HOPEFULLY ARE CALMING DOWN A BIT BUT AND THAT. AS TIME GOES ON AND WE CITY THE MITIGATION PLAN START TO TAKE HOLD THE HARDENING OF THE GRID- THE- CLEARING OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WE'RE CALLED OUT A NINE A ONE IN TEN FIFTY FOUR START WE BECOME PART OF THE- EVERY. DAY EXPERIENCE OF UTILITY TO DO THEIR PART AND FOR THE AGENCY TO REGULATE ACRO APPROPRIATELY- THAT WE WILL. HOPEFULLY DARK TO START TO SEE A REDUCTION AND THE KIND OF FIRES THAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING BUT IN THE MEANTIME. WE'RE OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THINKING THROUGH EVERY- APPROPRIATE- STRATEGY THAT ALLOWS US TO BE IN THE BEST POSITION. TO BE REVERSED. THE RE. PLACE THEIR REALLY NEED TO AND TO BE TO HAVE THE OF- I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE THE WORD YOU'VE GOT IT IN MY HEAD NOW NICHOLAS TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THE KIND OF- RESPONSIVENESS TO THE ISSUES AS THEIR UNFOLDING- AND I'M AND AGAIN YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON- AT THIS TIME- TO DO THIS JOB I MEAN I. I COMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR FOR SELECTING YOUR COMPLEMENT. YOUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLI SERVICE TO STEP IN TO THE ROLE AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO. CONTINUING TO FOSTER GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE P. USE THE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP AND TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FOR. COOPER LATER DROPS SHARPLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS ERNEST CHANGING TIME I KNOW MISTER MURATSUCHI SAID YOU HAD A VERY QUICK BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY TRANSITION TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER. OF IT IS TO HAVE A QUICK. YEAH MEAL YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED. QUICKLY LOCATION THIS CHURCH. THE TRANSIT ELECT TO VIRTUAL. I KNOW THAT OFF. THE YOU KNOW COMMON ARE MADE IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT. THE AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THE STATE ARE NEEDED TO SKYROCKETING ELECTRICITY RATES BUT IN MY READING OF THIS CHART RIGHT THAT THAT IT'S- SHOWING THAT IN FACT AT LEAST FOR. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND EVEN P. JEANNIE THAT IT LARGELY SEEMS TO BE FOLLOWING INFLATION EVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. YES I MEAN. THE POINT WHERE I MADE EARLIER IS AS THE JAN ME AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART ALSO EXCEEDS- AND THE OTHER POINT I WAS MAKING AS AS- DEMAND DECREASES- AND THAT'S WITH EFFICIENCIES WHICH IS WE'D WANT. AND THAT THAT SOME OF THESE RATES WILL CHANGE IS IN OUR MODEL AND OUR PREDICTIONS- BUT I READING THAT CORRECTLY. I I'LL TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER YOU TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY YOU WILL SEE- CALIFORNIA- ELECTRICITY RATES TRACKING INFLATION BOB OVER THAT TIME PERIOD ALMOST PERFECTLY UP UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS- FOR ONE UTILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS A MATTER WE APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE TODAY WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY STILL OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO POST TO YOU BUT WE- ANTICIPATE AS TIME GOES ON WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE HAVE FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS TO. MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALERT TO. YOUR ALERT OUR THOUGHTS AND VICE VERSA IF YOU COULD- IF YOU'RE NOT IN A RUSH WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO STICK AROUND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. ELIZABETH THOSE WHO WILL BE HERE REPRESENTING THE- IT'S- A MAKE A PRESENT. THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE. TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYTHING COMES UP DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT'LL BE BRIEF NO ABSOLUTELY I LIKE THIS ISN'T IMPORTANT DAY AND NOW I WOULD ABSOLUTELY. IF YOU COULD WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL FOR ME NOT TOO LONG AGO AND I FIND IT THANK YOUS- MISTER CHAIR SO MUCH FOR YOUR KIND REMARKS AND THAT OF THE OTHER MEMBERS. AS I SAID I HOPE YOU CAN STILL SAY THE SAME THING IN SIX MONTHS. AND I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN WHAT I SAID IN MY- OPENING REMARKS THAT I REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATION I WANT TO HEAR YOUR IDEAS ARE STAFF. WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ALL ON THESE IDEAS AND KEEP YOU AS INFORMED AS POSSIBLE YOUR QUESTIONS OF AN EXCELLENT TODAY. AND I SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEM. THANK YOU. BUT NOW AT THIS TIME I LIKE TO ASK GOES WITH ECHOES THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ADVOCATES TO JOIN US. WELCOME AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE TALIBAN ENERGIES COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS ELIZABETH ACKLES I'M DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS LINDA SERRA'S OUR MY DEPUTY OVER ENERGY. DR NET SKINNER OUR MANAGER FOR A SAFETY BRANCH AN ANA MARIA. I COMMUNICATIONS POLICY AND I'M JUST GONNA READ OUT OF A VERY QUICK ADVISORY FROM OUR ATTORNEY MY TESTIMONY MAY ADDRESS ISSUES AND A JUDY JUDY A COURT DURING OR RATE MAKING PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE CPC WHERE THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AS A PARTY THEREFORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMMISSION RIPPLE EIGHT POINT THREE SEE THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FILED A NOTICE OF MEDICATION AND THE APPLICABLES PROCEEDINGS. THERE ARE CBO DECISION MAKER LISTENING TO THIS PART OF THE-HEARING ANNA AT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WILL BE SINCE. SOME OF THE SENSOR STAINED. SO AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS THE INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE AT THE SI PC. OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE LOWEST POSSIBLE UTILITY RATES FOR CALIFORNIANS CONSUMERS CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. WE PROVIDE A VOICE FOR MILLIONS OF CONSUMER. ANY OF WHO DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THE STATE'S COMPLEX PROCESS SEES. LAST YEAR OUR DEDICATED TEAM OF ANALYSTS ENGINEERS AND ATTORNEYS FILED NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PLANES AND PC THE- AND- PAID HUNDREDS OF. MEETINGS. AN ACTION AS YOU HAVE YOU PROBABLY HAVE MY MICE IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE SLIDES- I'M NOW ONE SLIDE THREE WHICH IS CUSTOMER SAVINGS. SO OUR HARD WORK PAID OFF FOR THESE CONSUMERS THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE SAVE CUSTOMERS MORE THAN FOUR POINT THREE BILLION AND LOWER UTILITY REVENUES AND AVOIDED RATE INCREASES LAST YEAR. NEXT SLIDE POLICY ADVOCACY OUR GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR CONSUMERS ACROSS THE REGULATED INDUSTRY SECTORS. ENERGY WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SO THAT EACH DOLLAR INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA'S UTILITIES ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE RETURN FOR CONSUMERS IN TERMS OF THE STATE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. SLIDE FIVE MOST OF THAT FOUR POINT THREE BILLION IN SAVINGS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE RESULT OF OUR ADVOCACY AND TEN GENERAL RATE CASES OR G. R. C.'S AS THEIR DESCRIBED. TO BRIEFLY A G. R. C. IS A PROCEEDING IN WHICH A UTILITY REQUEST APPROVAL TO RECOVER. THE FUNDS IT FORECAST THAT IT WILL NEED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AND SOMETIMES A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. AND G. R. C.'S ARE THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE PROCEEDINGS AT THE P. YOU SEE. WHERE THE ONLY PARTY THAT CONDUCTS A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE UTILITIES APPLICATION WHICH ARE TYPICALLY THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG. IN SOME G. R. C.'S THAT INVOLVES SMALLER THE UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN WATER AND COMMUNICATIONS WERE THE ONLY PARTY EVALUATING THEIR PROPOSALS. SO LOOKING FORWARD NOW IT IN I WANT TO STRESS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND CONCERNS ABOUT SKYROCKETING RATES- WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE COST IMPACTS ON CUSTOMERS BILLS ACROSS INDUSTRIES AND IN PARTICULAR- TAKE TO KEEP A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF KEEPING UTILITY SERVICES AFFORDABLE IS KNOWING HOW THE COSTS OF ANY ONE PROPOSED UTILITY PROGRAM MIGHT IMPACT THE CUSTOMER'S BILLS. THIS INFORMATION WILL ENABLE THE CPC TO PRIORITIZE UTILITY PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S POLICIES IN A MORE TRANSPARENT MANNER. SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PC REQUIRE UTILITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF RECENT AND PENDING FUTURE M. INCREASES SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT THESE INCREASES. AS A WHOLE AND NOT JUST IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION WITH EACH EACH DIFFERENT PROCEEDING. WE'VE DEVELOPED A TRACKING TOOL THAT WE BELIEVE UTILITY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT WHEN PROPOSES TO RECOVER. COSTS FROM CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE PC'S CONSIDERATION OF AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES INCLUDE DIFFERENCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BASED ON KEY FACTORS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE GEOGRAPHY AND COST OF LIVING AND WE'RE WORKING WITH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP AND AFFORDABILITY FRAMEWORK TO BETTER IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF THE STATE MOST IN NEED INCLUDING OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR NOW I CAN MOVE FORWARD TO THE SAFETY SECTION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL- CALIFORNIANS PAY FOR AND EXPECT SAFE AND RELIABLE AND UNFORTUNATELY TWENTY NINETEEN MARKED THE CLOSE OF A DECADE PUNCTUATED BY NUMEROUS UTILITY CALLS BECAUSE CATASTROPHES. THE TWENTY TEN NATURAL GAS PIPELINE EXPLOSION IN SAN BRUNO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN- LISA CANYON STORAGE GAS LEAK AND THE MASSIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILD FIRES THESE INCIDENTS RESULTED IN OVER A HUNDRED FIFTH TALENT STOP BECAUSE OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES DESTROYED AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS THAT ARE NOT YET FULLY KNOWN. AND OF COURSE LAST YEAR AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. IT CALLED CULMINATED IN ENERGY UTILITIES DECIDING TO SHUT OFF POWER TO MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT THEIR FACILITIES WOULD CAUSE MORE WILD FIRES. AS YOU KNOW THE START UPS WREAK HAVOC ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND PUT MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS AT RISK SUCH AS OUR ELDERLY CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO DEPEND ON ELECTRIC POWER MEDICAL DEVICES. THE SORT OF THOUGHT HIGHLIGHTED OTHER SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RELATED ISSUES SUCH AS THE NEED FOR COMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO INSTALL BACKUP POWER TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN CALL FOR HELP OR CALL THEIR LOVED ONES IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. EVEN WHEN THEIR POWER SHUT OFF. SO I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF OUR SAFETY WORK IN TWENTY NINETEEN STARTING WITH THE NEED FOR RELIABLE WIRELESS SERVICE DURING POWER SHUT UP. WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PC EXIT THE THIRD TO REQUIRE WIRELESS COMPANIES TO INSTALL BACKUP POWER IN THEIR FACILITIES AND TO EMPLOY ALL MEANS NECESSARY TO WHAT THIS. IS MAINTAINED STE. HOURS FROM THE START ELECTRICAL OUTAGE. WE ALSO URGE THAT SI PC TO ASSESS THE UTILITIES DECISION MAKING PROCESSES TO ENSURE THAT THE UTILITIES WILL SHUT OFF POWER TO CUSTOMERS ONLY AS A- TRULY A LAST RESULT RESORT. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SEE REQUIRE UTILITIES TO IMMEDIATELY ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THEIR LIST OF CUSTOMERS PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH SPECIFIC ENERGY NEEDS DUE TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS. I ALSO WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION A LISA CANYON AND THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE LEAK THAT HAPPENED. WITH SO CAL GAS IS A LISA CAN'T NOT. FACILITY WITH SUBMITTED TESTIMONY THAT PROCEEDING THAT IDENTIFIES THAT SO CAL GAS DID NOT KILL. THE NECESSARY ANALYSIS OF UNDER COVERED KURT BUSCH AND IN ONE OF THE AISLES AT LEAKED AND THAT UTILITY IS MISSING CRITICAL SAFETY INFORMATION. OUR WORK IS ONGOING AREA. I'LL LOOK FORWARD. EVEN WITH THE RIGHT NOW WORK OF THIS BODY IN THE GOVERNOR'S AND MAY OTHER AN AROUND THIS CLEAR WE STILL FACE SIGNIFICANT WILDFIRE THREATS. AND NOT ONLY DO WE FACE THE CHALLENGES OF ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THEIR PROPERTY IN AN ENVIRONMENT ARE KEPT SAFE BUT WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS CUSTOMERS CONCERNS REGARDING THE COSTS OF THE MONTHLY BILLS AND THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR UTILITY SERVICES. SO I WILL BE VERY CLEAR THAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHTS STAY ON THAT UTILITY SYSTEMS ARE SAFE AND DIMMERS DO NOT FOOT THE BILL FOR ANY TELL THE MISDEEDS. WITH THIS IN MIND WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A STRONG VOICE FOR CUSTOMERS ON THESE ISSUES. SO FINALLY BRIEFLY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. SOME OF OUR WORK IN SUPPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. REACHING THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IS CRITICAL TO THE INSURANCE ENSURING THE WELL BEING OF OUR RESIDENTS. WERE FOCUSED ON ADVANCING THE STATE GOALS AND THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS CAN BE ALIGNED WITH PROVIDING SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE WE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATE FOR UTILITY TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ENABLE INCREASED APPOINTMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. MAP SOME MONEY MY SEEN THE BENEFITS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE MICE IN THE COST IMPACTS TO RATE PAYERS. FOR INSTANCE ARE SO WITH SDG E. REGARDING THEIR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY EVEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM RESULTED IN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CUSTOMER SAVINGS WHILE DOUBLING ESTY CHENEY'S ORIGINAL PROGRAM GOALS. ARE ADVOCACY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE RATE PAYER FUNDED EVEY CHARGING PILOT PROGRAMS PROVIDE IMPORTANT LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE POLICY WE ALSO FOCUS ON EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT. TRANSPORTATION ON THAT OCCASION. GOING FORWARD WILL CONTINUE ADVOCATE LOAD SERVE. MEET THEIR- TO PROVIDE RELIABLE ELECTRICITY SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND COST EFFECTIVENESS AND WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO. AND WORK TO ENSURE AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES AN ADVOCATE THAT USING RATE PAIR FUND SHOULD ONLY BE FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE DEMONSTRATED TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS ENSURE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND PROVIDE RELIABLE COMMUNICATION SERVICES. SO WITH THAT I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY SO I'M GOING TO WRAP UP QUICKLY YOU KNOW CLEARLY LOOKING FORWARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS YEAR'S SUCCESSES AND WORK TO ACHIEVE THE BEST VALUE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ACROSS ARE REGULATED INDUSTRIES. AND WITH THAT I WOULD WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE OKAY WELL THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT. YOU DO ON BEHALF OF RATEPAYERS OF. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GUESS I WOULD ASK AND IT RELATES TO A TEN FIFTY FOUR- AND THE- WILDFIRE FUND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED USING- DUE TO BE OUR FUNDS. WE WERE EVALUATING POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF THE UTILITIES FOUND THEMSELVES AND THE WHOLE THAT THE AND- AND THE COST THAT THAT WAS BEARING ON RATEPAYERS. CERTAINLY WITH THE FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE UTILITIES IN THE STRUGGLE THAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH OF THE ONLY VIABLE SOLUTION- THAT CAME FORWARD WAS TO EXTEND THE- DELIVERY OUR CHARGE. AND THAT CREATING THE FUNDED CREATED A BALANCE WHERE SHAREHOLDERS PUT MONEY INTO THE FUND AS WELL. AT THINK ABOUT ALL. OF WAS PROBABLY A REALLY APPROPRIATE WAY TO SORT OF- HAVE A SOLUTION THAT BROUGHT SHAREHOLDERS TO THE TABLE WHICH HAD NOT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY AND THEREBY RELIEVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON RATE PAYERS. THERE WAS A AS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- YOUR OFFICE WENT FORWARD I GUESS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL WITH. CONCERNS AND OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF THE FUND. AND OUR EXTENSION OF THE DATA BE OUR CHARGE AND- I GUESS NOT HAVING HEARD THAT CAN STE AND WHILE WE WERE TO BE LIBERAL. AROUND THAT SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE PAUSE AND WONDER IF THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. WHAT OPTIONS ARE WATER OF OTHER APPROACHES WOULD YOU HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIACY OF THE CRISIS IF YOU WELL IN THAT MOMENT- AND SO I GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION OF BECAUSE WE HAD NOT GONE DOWN THAT PATH. THEN WE WOULD. BE IN A PLACE I THINK OF- EVEN INCREASE PAYROLL AND- INCREASE IMPACT ON REPAIRS IN PROBABLY ANOTHER UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY- I. JUST THROW THAT OUT BECAUSE I WAS A LITTLE I PONDERED. WHY WE HAD NOT HEARD THE OPPOSITION DURING THE FOUR OF. TEN FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEAR CHEN I APPRECIATE THAT AND CERTAINLY. IN THE FUTURE WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. IN CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AND RAISING ANY CONCERNS IN REAL TIME- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE ARE IN A REALLY TOUGH PLACE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO SET UP. A FUND THAT COULD HELP UTILITIES TO STATE. THE TO SPREAD THE COSTS OF THE WILD FIRES AND TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RELIABLE ELECTRICITY SERVICE- WE DID HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUN WE WORST IN PARTICULAR WE WERE- THE INITIAL LANGUAGE IT WASN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR IF THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. FOR UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO BE- PAID THROUGH THE FUND AND THEN ALSO GO BACK AND RECOVER THAT COST FROM FROM CUSTOMERS- SO THAT THAT WAS CLARIFIED OF BOTH BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND BY THE P. YOU SEE THAT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT AND- AND SO THAT WAS THAT CLEARED UP ONE OF OUR- BIG CONCERNS- AND I THINK WHAT I'M- GONNA DO IS. IS TURN TO DR SKINNER AND SEE IF HE WOULD LIKE TO. ADD ANYTHING TO THAT BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WITH WITH THE FUND AND THAT WAS LATER CLARIFIED. THE ONLY OTHER ITEM THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE OTHER CONCERN WOULD BE. BECAUSE THESE CHARGES ARE BEING. LEVY IT PRIOR TO KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT A PARTICULAR UTILITY MAY BE PART OF THE APPLICABLE ENTITIES FOR THE FUND IN THIS CASE PGA ANY WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SURCHARGES AUTHORIZED UPON ALL P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS. AND THEN IF THEY FAILED TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY- BY THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR. AND THUS WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE FUND P. GINNY'S CUSTOMERS WOULD POTENTIALLY GET CHARGED. BUT THE UTILITY WITH AND BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS TO THE LANGUAGE OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR. WELL I KNOW THAT AS WE ARE. WATCHING THIS REAL TIME AT THE TEL AVIV IS CERTAINLY IN A PLACE WHERE BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CPUC THEIR CONVERSATIONS TO THE COURT AND AS YOU HEARD OF THE PRESIDENT. ARTICULATE THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF RESOLUTION THERE WILL BE SOME FORM OF ENTITY I WOULD IMAGINE THAT EMERGES OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THAT WILL PROVIDE POWER TO- THE SERVICE AREA WHAT AT ENTITY LOOKS LIKE AND HOW IT ULTIMATELY. IS STRUCTURED IS STILL UNDER CONVERSATIONS AND SO THERE IT IS A BUT WILL THERE BE SOME ENTITY CALLED SOME UTILITY THAT WILL PROVIDE POWER TO COST CUSTOMER BASE THAT STILL IS. IN A RISK OF HAVING QUALIFIERS- STARTED THAT NEED TO STILL PARTICIPATE IN A FUND OF SOME SORT I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF UTILITY AND THERE IS A DEADLINE THERE'S A WALL UP THERE. FOR A KNEE OR SOME. KHAN TO EMERGE TO ALLOW TO BE ABLE TO PROTEST SO I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A UTILITY STANDING TO BE ABLE TO AND HOPEFULLY IN A TIMELY WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE FUND PARTICIPATION. SO I IT BUT I WAS CURIOUS IN TERMS OF IF NOT THAT APPROACH THAN WHAT. AND THAT'S WHERE MY CONCLUSION- WELL THAT'S WHERE I WAS COMING FROM YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS THIS DOESN'T WORK FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER APPROACH. NO SIR THE ANSWER BUT I'M JUST. THE KERR TO ME AND THE MOMENT THAT I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOU- IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. WHEN WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION EVERY YEAR AND WE AGAIN APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU'RE OUT THERE- TENDING TO DO ON BEHALF OF REPAIRS. WELL THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD WORK ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WILL.
