I WAS ASKED TO GIVE A OVERVIEW OF THE STATE SUBSIDIZED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND DESCRIBE THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC. CAUCUS PROPOSAL. THE STATES WILL JUMP INTO THE- REVEALS THE STATE SUBSIDIZES SEVERAL CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE STATE SPENDS ROUGHLY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION TO SERVE AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS. OUR CHILD CARE THE STATE SERVICE CALL CHILDREN MEETING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR OTHER PROGRAMS THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN SERVICE GENERALLY SET ANNUALLY BY THE STATE DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE STATE HAS TWO TYPES OF CHILD BASED PROGRAMS ARE DIRECT CONTRACTOR RAMS. AFTER BASED PROGRAMS PRIMARILY COVER CHILDCARE ANY ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR THESE PROGRAMS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE REIMBURSED BASED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. THE RATE ITSELF IS BASED ON A SURVEY CONDUCTED EVERY OTHER YEAR BUT THE STATE DETERMINES WHAT TO READ TO USE AND WE ARE CURRENTLY USING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY. THREE VARIES BY COUNTY AGE OF CHILD CERTAIN AMOUNT HERE USE AND THE TYPE OF CHILD CARE PROVIDER. FOR THESE PROGRAMS FAMILIES WILL GAIN ELIGIBILITY FOR CHILD CARE A WITH THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT OR AN ALTERNATE TEAM AGENCY. ONCE THE FAMILIES RECEIVE ELIGIBILITY YOU CAN USE THE VOUCHER TO RECEIVE CHILD CAREFROM ANY PROVIDER IN HER FIRST IN ANY SETTING UP HER FIRST. WE ALSO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WITH MINORS PRIMARILY PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN STATE PRESCHOOL OR THE GENERAL CHILDCARE PROGRAM. CONTRACT PROVIDERS ARE REIMBURSED BY THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE RESET ANNUALLY BYTHE STATE. THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ADJUSTED BY AGE AMOUNT OF CARE USE AND OTHER FACTORS. IT WAS NOTABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC ADJUSTMENT. THESE PROVIDERS CONTRACT WITH THE STATE TO SERVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHILDREN. FAMILIES WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE CONTRACTED PROVIDER. TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THESE PROGRAMS. H. FIVE YEAR AGENDA BEGINS ON THE- ON THE CAN IN ON. PER AND THE STATE RESPONSE CHILDCARE PROVIDER HOWEVER YOUR- BUT ARE SERVING YOUR- ARE. LONG OF INCOME DUE TO START LAST OPENING. PROVIDERS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING HIGHER OPERATION COSTS DUE TO CLEANING SANITATION. OTHER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SIX OF YOUR HAS INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSE CLOSURES. THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FACILITIES CLOSED CURRENTLY OVER THE LAST YEAR ANNUALLY- SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FACILITIES WERE TEMPORARY CLOSE AT THE END OF MARCH. ON PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA HAS A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILD CARE. IN TOTAL THE THREE PACKAGES AND MADE FIVE BILLION AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC. HE AGE- EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA AND SHOWS HOW THESE FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED SO FAR THE STATE HAS APPROVED READ EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION OF THESE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS. THE STATE IS STILL NEEDS TO APPROPRIATE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION OF THE CHRISTA FINDS IT AND THEN. EIGHTY BILLION THE A. R. T. THEY'RE VERY ANALYSIS WE PROVIDED ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH THE REMAINDER THESE TIMES THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ACTIONS OF THE STATE COULD IMPLEMENT QUICKLY GIVEN THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES CREATED BY THE COAL IN NINETEEN EMERGENCY- THIS INCLUDES USING EXISTING PROGRAMS EXTENDING EXISTING PANDEMIC ACTIONS AND USING SOME SIMPLE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES. I JUST THINK YOUR MAIL WANT TO SPEND HEALTHCARE PLANS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS GIVEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL CZ GPG FUNDS FROM THE A. R. P. CAN BE SPENT THROUGH SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE ALL THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET CYCLE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER MODIFYING FLEXIBILITY STREET IN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THE HAND WE PROVIDED OUR ANALYSIS IS LEAVING FAMILY FEAST- WE WOULD FURTHER NOTE. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AVAILABLE IS A ONE TIME FUNDING DURING THE PANDEMIC THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED USING SOME OF THESE ONE TIME FUNDS TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY SLOTS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WITHOUT ONGOING FUNDING HOWEVER FAMILY RECEIVING TEMPORARY SOFTLY BUT ACTUALLY BE DISTANT ROLLED- STAFF A BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS PROPOSAL. TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR GENDER DESCRIBES THIS PROPOSAL THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PROPOSING MAKING PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF PRIORITY AREAS THESE INCLUDE. A SIGNIFICANT STEP UP TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AN ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE SLOTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARD UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR AGES ZERO TO THREE. ESTABLISH A SUPPORT AND SUPPORT CHILDCARE WORKER POSITION TRAINING PROGRAMS REDUCE COSTS TO WORKING FAMILIES BY EDUCING AND ELIMINATING FAMILY FEES. INCREASE PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO ACHIEVE A LITTLE A LITTLE WAGE FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS. STABLE LIFE AND REMAIN AND RETAIN THAT PROVIDERS AT THE STATE EMERGES FROM THE PANDEMIC SUPPORT PROVIDERS THAT HAVE REMAINED OPEN DURING THE PANDEMIC BY CONTINUING HOLD HARMLESS POLICIES. PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDS TO HELP PROVIDERS WHO HAVE CLOSED- TO REOPEN OR THOSE WHO ARE OPEN TO EXPAND RETAINED ITS CENTRAL WORKERS- FAMILIES IN THE. CHILD CARE SYSTEM. IS MY REMARKS BUT TO TAKE QUESTIONS THE- TIME. THANK VERY MUCH SHOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD QUESTION UNTIL THE END. OF THE PRESENTATION OF ALL PALACE. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO CHRISTINA FIGUEROA NEXT. I DO NOT SEE HER HERE FURTHER SHE IS. THERE SHE IS WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTINA FIGUEROA- I AM A FULL TIME WORKING PARENT RECEIVING A CHILD CARE SUBSIDY IN SOUTH KING COUNTY.I HAVE THREE CHILDREN. TWO OF WHICH ATTEND A LOCAL CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT THEY LOVED IN ABIT TENDING NOW FOR THREE YEARS. I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MY WORK AND SUPPORT. MY CHILDREN WITHOUT MY CHILD CARE CENTER AND MY CHILD CARE SUBSIDY. CHILD CARE IS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH ME AND MY CHILDREN. ON MOST DAYS THEY DON'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE TO ME WHEN I'M DROPPING THEM OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BUSY RUNNING OFF TO SAY GOOD MORNING AND HELLO TO THEIR TEACHERS AND OTHER STUDENTS. EVEN ON TOUGH DAYS IN THE MORNING SOME DAYS ARE TOUGH. I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL WITH. BRIGHT SMILES ON THEIR FACES READY TO ENJOY THE DAY. I SEE THEIR LIVES POSITIVELY BEING INFLUENCED. BY THE TEACHERS IN THE PROGRAM AND THE STUDENTS THAT. THEY'RE ABLE TO SEE EVERY DAY ESPECIALLY WITH CORPORATE SPENDING AND TOUGH WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING AND BEING AWAY FROM FRIENDS. WITH THAT BEING SAID ONE OF THE MAJOR FINANCIAL FACTORS I HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH EVERY MONTH IT'S MY FAMILY FEE. I PAY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND SHE STRUGGLES EVERY MONTH. TO KEEP UP WITH PAYING MY FEET. IN ORDER TO KEEP MY CHILD CARE SUBSIDY I HAVE TO PAY THIS FEE. OTHERWISE I COULD BE TERMINATED FROM THE PROGRAM. FOR SEVERAL MONTHS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. THE STATE WAIVES FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES. DURING THIS TIME MY STRESS LEVEL WAS SO MUCH LOWER. I FINALLY HAD A LITTLE BIT OF WIGGLE ROOM. I WAS ABLE TO USE THE MONEY THAT I SAVED. FROM FAMILY FEES TO BE ABLE TO BUY NEW TIRES THAT I DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR MY CAR. I WAS EVEN ABLE TO HANDLE LIFE UNEXPECTED LIFE CHANGES AND CHALLENGES. BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME THEM. BECAUSE I HAD THE EXTRA LITTLE REAL ESTATE THAT SAVED MONEY FROM MY FAMILY FEES. BUT THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. SEPTEMBER FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. BECAUSE I'M IN A CENTRAL WORKER AND WAS USING IN PERSON CHILDCARE. I STARTED PAYING FEES AGAIN. AND OUT A FAMILY FEES ARE WAIVED I COULD PAY DOWN SOME OF MY CENTRAL BILLS LIKE P. JEANNIE AND WATER FOR EXAMPLE. BAMA'S WIN BE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THE CHILD CARE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PAY THE FEES OR FOR THAT. THE MONEY THE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR BILLS FOR SHOES CLOTHING FOR KIDS. WHY IS CALIFORNIA PENALIZE WITH PARENTS WHO NEED HELP PAYING FOR CHILDCARE. BUT STILL SHE CHARGES FEES WHEN WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. I WOULD ALSO USE THE MONEY TO SUPPORT MY CHILDREN WITH EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD. YEAH BECAUSE I'M TAKING ALL OF MY OTHER BILLS AND MAKING SURE TO KEEP UP WITH THEM. MY BOYS WANT TO PLAY SPORTS AND MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN ASKING ME REPEATEDLY TO JOIN A DANCE CLASS ESPECIALLY SINCE THINGS ARE BECOMING NORMAL- SAYS THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE. OF COURSE FOLLOWING SAFETY PROTOCOLS BUT CAN JUST ONE OF THE KIDS AND HAVE FUN AND- BE AROUND. THIRD AT THEIR PEERS. SOLUTION THE FAMILY FEUD THE FAMILY HE PROBLEM IS TO WAIVE FEES. IS TO WAIVE THE FEES TO BRING IMMEDIATE HELP TO FAMILIES LIKE MINE WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO WAIVE THESE FEES ARE CURRENT FAMILIES AND FOR EVERY NEW SLOT THAT YOU ADD. TO MAKE SURE THE FUNDING INCLUDES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE SLOTS THAT YOU ADD. INCLUDE HER FAMILY FEES BE WAIVED ALSO. WITH THE SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THE FEDERAL CHILD CARE RELIEF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY NOW LIKE NEVER BEFORE TO HELP THE FAMILIES. THE WORKING FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA NEED YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WILLING TO GIVE US YOUR COMMENTS TODAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU AND THE NEXT WILL BE LILY MARQUEZ ALSO APPARENT. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HI EVERYBODY HI EVERYBODY MY NAME IS LESLIE MARQUEZ I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF PARENT VOICES I AM A MOTHER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY AND A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY AND A FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. I'M HERE JUST TODAY AT COMMENT AND SHARE MY STORY AS IT RELATES TO CHILD CARE BUT HOPES THAT EVERYONE ON THIS CALL. IS ABLE TO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD CARE EARLY LEARNING FOR CHILDREN. I'VE HAD A LONG ISSUE WITH BEING ON THE WAIT LIST I WAS A WORKING PROFESSIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION. UNTIL SIX YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED PLANNING FOR A FAMILY. I WAS BLESSED TO BECOME A MOTHER TO A BOY YEARS AGO SIX YEARS AGO AND I WAS ABLE TO WORK PART TIME EVEN AFTER MY MATERNITY LEAVE. AND I ARRANGED FOR AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE FOR HIM ON A PART TIME BASIS. EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL I BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND CHILD WHICH WASN'T PLANNED. BUT YEAH MY JOB VALUED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAD A FLEXIBILITY WITH MY WORK SCHEDULE WHEN I HAD WENT AHEAD AND WENT ON MY MATERNITY LEAVE. I STRUGGLED TO FIND AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE AND QUALITY CHILDCARE FOR TRUE BABY. SO I MADE A HARD LIFE DECISION TO GIVE UP MY CAREER. I GAVE UP NO I GAVE MY NOTICE. I SOLD MY HOME AND I MOVED TO ANOTHER CITY. INTO WITH MY FROM MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY DUE TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE WHAT'S THE REASON FOR ME TO BECOME A STAY HOME MOM. I WAS LIVING WITH ONE WORKING ADULT THE TWO DISABLED ELDERLY WOMEN AND TWO BABIES. AND I LIVING IN A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT SIX OF US THAT INCREASED OUR STRESS LEVELS AND AFFECTED MY MENTAL HEALTH. THREE YEARS AGO IWAS OFFERED A JOB AS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER. AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO MAKE A CHILD TRAPPED THE CASE FOR MY CHILDREN. I WANTED TO FOCUS ON MY WORK HOWEVER I WAS PLACED ON THE WAITLIST. AND AS A PANDEMIC BEGAN THE PERSON THAT TOOK CARE OF NEEDED MORE OF MY ATTENTION. AND UNFORTUNATELY MY SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO HE NEEDED ME TO. SO I HAD TO QUIT MY JOB AGAIN DUE TO THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE I COULDN'T GET MY FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD CARE OR INTO AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM HE HAS NOW STARTED KINDERGARTEN. LAST YEAR AND HE'S BEEN HE WAS DOING IT. ONLINE AND- HE JUST STARTED IN PERSON LEARNING TWO THREE WEEKS AGO AND HE'S BEHIND ACADEMICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND SOCIALLY. HE LAST WEEK GOT A COLD AND SO I SUBMITTED HIM INTO A CORPORATE TEST TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN OTHER PROTOCOL. OR YOU HAVE TO QUARANTINE SO I HAD TO TAKE THE TEST HE WAS NEGATIVE SO MY CONCERN WAS MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOL HAD. THE PROTOCOL THE PROPER FOR HIM TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY. THE FASHION PPO SUPPLIES. SO THAT I'M NOT CONCERNED OF. I'M CLING FINANCE. AND ENVIRONMENT SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. BUT HE CAN'T DRIVE JOIN ONLINE LEARNING STYLE IN PERSON LEARNING IS THE ONLY WAY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN AND GROW AND THAT'S- THE ONLY OPTION THAT I HAVE FOR HIM. TO LEARN. SO THAT'S THE RISK BUT I'M TAKING WITH HIM. AND RIGHT NOW I'M CURRENTLY ON THE WAIT LIST FOR MY FOUR YEAR OLD TO GET CHILD CARE WHICH I HOPE THAT SHE GETS PLACEMENTS. I APPLIED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO GET MY DAUGHTER INTO A TEACHING PROGRAM. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS LIMITED TICKETS GOALS. SO IT'S NOT EVEN A- REQUIREMENT. OF WHAT I WAS TOLD THAT A FOUR YEAR OLD. TO GET INTO AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. SO I HAVE A HUGE FEAR OF NOT. IN MY CHILD CARE FOR MY DAUGHTER. EITHER ENTITY K. PROGRAM OR INTO EARLY LEARNING AND HAVE HER STRUGGLING LIKE MY SON IS NOW. SO THE LACK OF AFFORDABILITY AND THE ACCESS IS REAL. MAKING SURE FAMILIES ARE NOT ON THE WAITING LIST FOR VERY LONG AND ONCE THEY GET PLACED. THEY HAVE THEIR FEES WAIT. FOR STRUGGLING FAMILIES LIKE MINE. BECAUSE IT'S HARD ENOUGH BUT DEMOCRATS ONLY MADE IT WORSE. HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING A PARENT AND WORKING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY SHOULD GO THROUGH ALSO STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO PROVIDE ALONG WITH PAYING FOR CHILD CARE AND FAMILY FEEDS CAN POSE A HUGE BURDEN. THANKS FOR STAYING HOME BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE QUALITY. ACCESSIBLE CHILD CARE AND THE MENTAL STRESS IS WHAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A PARENT SHOULD GO THROUGH EITHER. PARENTS SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NECESSITIES THE BASIC NECESSITIES LONG CHILD CARE WAITLISTS FAMILY FEEDS. FOR THE CONCERN THAT QUALITY CHILD CARE AND A LACK OF PORTABILITY CARE. FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THE FAMILY SHOULD BE ON THE WAY IT SHOULD BE ON THE WAIT LIST FOR THREE YEARS THAT'S UST TOO LONG AND YOU CANNOT GET THAT TIME BACK I CAN'T GET THAT. I WANT. TELL ME SHOULD BE SHOULD BE WEIGHED. MORE WAITING LIST SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE. I THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES INCLUDING FAMILIES PARTICIPATING ON CAL WORKS THERE SHOULD BE T. K. PROGRAMS FOR ALL KIDS TWIN CREEKS BEND TO PREPARE. OR EDUCATION SETTING SO THAT THEY'RE NOT BEHIND WHEN THEY START ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I INVESTED TIME TALKING TO EARLY LEARNING ADMINISTRATORS AND SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED STAFF THAT HAVE THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW CAN'T GIVE ME A DIRECT ANSWER WITH REGARDS TO THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR. MY CHILDREN'S WAIT LIST. I STRUGGLE PUTTING MY SON WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TO CHECK. INTO AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. AND CHILD CARE SO HE HAD TO GROW WITHOUT THAT. AND NOW HE STARTED KINDERGARTEN. KINDERGARTEN ANY STRUGGLING MORE THAN EVER. SO I'M STRUGGLING NOW TO PUT MY FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER INTO A TEACHING PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH I APPLIED EARLY ON LAST YEAR. THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE A SUPPORT FOR LEBANON FAMILY'S. HISPANIC FAMILIES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR LANGUAGE SERVICES. AND OTHER TARGETED CULTURAL NEEDS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY. CHILD CARE SERVICES NEED TO BE PRIORITIZED TO BENEFIT EVERYONE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL BEING. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT HAS AFFECTED US IN SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND SOME ANYWAY. THE FIRST YEARS OF A CHILD IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A HUGE INVESTMENT CHILD CARE CHILDREN OUR FUTURE. AND WANTS PARENTS CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEIR KIDS ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT WORLD AND STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY BY ALLOWING FANS TO FOCUS ON WORKING AND CONTRIBUTING BACK. CHILDREN WILL BECOME HEALTHY AND DRIVE IN THIS WORLD SO CHILDREN OUR FUTURE AND WE SHOULD INVEST IN THEM AND HELP THEM DEVELOP THEIR ACADEMIC. PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL WORK. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- THEY WERE. REMARKABLY MOVING AND I KNOW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HARD SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OR DONNA SNEER INJURE WHO FROM THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON IS NOW NEWS ALSO AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DONNA SNARE DRUM THE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF CHILDCARE INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE BUDGET. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATE LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR CHILD CARE PLAN AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. AS WE WORK TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. MANY OF US HAVE KNOWN THAT CHILD CARE HAS BEEN A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ALLALONG. THE PANDEMIC SHONE A BRIGHT LIGHT ON THE NEEDS FOR CHILD CARE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE ESPECIALLY OUR SOCIAL WORKERS FOR PARENTS TO GET TO WORK AND SUPPORT OUR STATE DURING A CRISIS. WHAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE SHATTERED AND SHIFTED TO DISTANCE LEARNING TO KEEP TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF STATE CHILDCARE WAS DECLARED AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE AND MOST OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS REMAINED OPEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. CHILDCARE PROVIDERS LARGELY WOMEN OF COLOR HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES DURING THE PANDEMIC CARING FOR CHILDREN IN OUR HEALTH CARE FOOD SERVICE PUBLIC SAFETYAND OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ARE CHILDCARE HEROES AT RISK TO THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES WERE OPEN CARING FOR CHILDREN AND SUPPORTING DISTANCE LEARNING. SADLY THEY WERE DOING THIS WITH COMPENSATION PROVIDED BY STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT ARE FALLING BEHIND THE COST OF THE MARKET IN AN ANTIQUATED. SYSTEM WHICH DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR. I AND ADD COMPENSATION. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THESE ESSENTIAL CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY INCREASING REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR ALL PROVIDERS AND REFORMING OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES SYSTEM AS PROPOSED IN SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX AUTHORED BY SENATOR LEYVA TO A MODERN STRUCTURE WHICH BEGINS TO MOVE US TO A MORE EQUITABLE RATE STRUCTURE USING THE MOST CURRENT WHICH WOULD BE THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN R. M. R. SURVEY. AND MOVING TOWARD A SINGLE SIMPLIFIED STRUCTURE FOR PAYMENTS. WHILE MOST PROVIDERS HAVE REMAINED OPEN AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES MANY PROVIDERS HAVE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF REDUCED ENROLLMENT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL HEALTH CONCERNS AND DECLINED ENROLLMENTS AS MANY EMPLOYEES SHIFTED AT HOME FOR SAFETY. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND 20%OF OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE STILL CLOSED. AND THOSE THAT ARE OPERATING ARE OPERATING AT REDUCED ENROLLMENT STOOD A COVETED SAFETY CAPACITIES. TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S FULL RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC WE MUST ALLOCATE STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES TO GET THESE PROVIDERS BACK OPEN AND ON THEIR FEET. WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR REFORM REIMBURSEMENT RATES OTHERWISE PEOPLE WON'T COME BACK. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF TO HELP CHILD CARE BUSINESSES CATCH UP WITH THE FINANCIAL LOSSES THEY'VE WEATHERED DURING THE COVERT OPERATIONS. AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE RE OPENING AND RESTART INCENTIVES TO BRING OUR CLOSED PROVIDERS BACK. WE ALSO NEED TO OFFER RECRUITMENT INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO COME INTO THIS BUSINESS AND OPERATE CHILDCARE. I APPRECIATE YOUR DISCUSSION OF THIS TOPIC TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL'S COMPLETE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. NEXT WE'LL MOVE TO NINA BUT SAY BUT SEE HOPEFULLY I'M PRONOUNCING YOUR NAME RIGHT. FROM THE EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES MY NAME IS NINA BIRTHDAY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AVERAGE HOW CALIFORNIA. WE ARE A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED SUBSIDIZED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION AGENCIES IN THE STATE REPRESENTING 65% OF ALL SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS. WE'RE IN AN INCREDIBLE TIME TO MAKE THE CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO ENABLE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TO BETTER SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND BUILD A STRONGER EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEM. WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE EMERGENCY INCREASES TO EARLY CARE THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FIELD AS THE KIND OF IT NINETEEN PANDEMIC PROGRESSED BUT AS WE LOOK TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET AND FEDERAL FUNDS INVESTMENT. THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT CAN BE DONE TO STABILIZE AND BUILD UP THE CHILD CARES SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FOLLOWING ITEMS THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET REQUEST. THE FIRST WOULD BE A HOLD HARMLESS FOR PROGRAMS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- AS WAS NOTED BY MY PREVIOUS PANELISTS AS PROGRAMS RE OPEN THEY ARE BEING HELD JUST SOCIAL DISTANCING ROLLS AND REDUCED CAPACITY. CAPACITY OF PROGRAMS WILL ALSO BE DOWN FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR THEREFORE FULLY FUNDING PROGRAMS WITH A HOLD HARMLESS CLAUSE WOULD ALLOW PROGRAMS TO MAINTAIN THEIR FULL. CONTRACT FUNDING WHAT PROVIDER PROVIDING CARE TO CHILDREN UNDER CURRENT GUIDANCE AND TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT DURING THE AFTERMATH OF THE OUTBREAK WE ARE IN SUCH AN EINER STABLE SITUATION RIGHT NOW. AND WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE MADE WHOLE SO THAT BE I MEAN. THE INCREASE CLOSURES DO NOT CONTINUE ALSO LEARNING FROM THE CO GOOD NINETEEN PANDEMIC A CHANGE THAT WE CAN MAKE PERMANENTLY THAT WOULD BE FRIENDLY TO FAMILIES AND PROVIDE STABILITY TO PROVIDERS. WOULD BE TO REIMBURSE SUBSIDIZE PROVIDERS INCLUDING DIRECT CONTRACTING CENTERS ABOUT YOUR CHILD CARE CENTERS FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BASED ON ENROLLMENT. NOT ATTENDANCE REIMBURSING FOR CHUCK SUBSIDY FOR RAW ALLOW MAX STAY. FOR PROVIDE. ALLOWING THEM TO STAY OPEN REGARDLESS OF THE ATTENDANCE PATTERNS OF CHILDREN AND WE ALL KNOW THAT- COVE IT IT'S STILL GOING ON WE ARE STILL HAVING OPENING ENCLOSURE SO THIS WILL CONTINUE THREE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M ALSO A GREAT REFORM FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AS REFERENCED BY DONNA SALINGER. WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING A SINGLE REAR REGIONALI STATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM FOR SUBSIDIZED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THIS SINGLE SYSTEM AS A STEP TO RIGHT SIZE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURING CALIFORNIA AND TO INCENTIVIZE PROGRAMSPRING CREEK CREEK QUALITY WHILE RECOGNIZING REGIONAL AND AGE COST DIFFERENCE SAYS. I NEED ANOTHER PERMANENT CHANGE- THAT COULD BE USED TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND ALLOW PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WOULD BE TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TO EXPAND THE AGES OF CHILDREN SERVED SO THAT THEY CAN SERVE MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN QUALITY EARLY LEARNING SETTINGS AS AS ONE OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. IN YOUR BUDGET PRIORITIES WE ALSO RECOMMEND EXPANSION TO CHILD CARE SPACES INCLUDING TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS DIRECT CONTRACTING AND BELCHER PROVIDERS UTILIZING FEDERAL AND GENERAL FUNDS. THERE ARE STILL VERY LONG WAITING LIST AS WE HEARD FROM OUR PARENTS TODAY AND THERE ARE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN WHO AREN'T STILL NOT RECEIVING CARE. ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE NEED FOR INCREASED INFANT AND TODDLER CARE DIRECT CONTRACTING TITLE FIVE PROGRAMS GENERAL CHILDCARE HAS SEEN MINIMAL EXPANSIONS AND INCREASES OVER PREVIOUS YEARS. IN FACT THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT HAVE NO GENERAL CHUKAR CONTRACTS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN AND AGENCIES THAT CONCERNS THAT SHOULDER AND- WE WOULD RECOMMEND AN INCREASE TO DIRECT CONTRACTING TITLE FIVE SHE'S TEACH OUR FUNDS FOR CENTERS AND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME EDUCATION NETWORKS. IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET YEAR THERE WAS AN EXPANSION OF FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO START A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RECEIVED REQUESTS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SIGNS THAT IS A HUNDRED AND 50% DEMAND OVER THE FUNDS THAT WERE ABLE TO BE ALLOCATED- GRAMS OR STOP. IN THEIR TO GO THEY JUST NEED THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO- RECOMMEND ALLOWING CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN THEIR SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SPACES THE FIRST YEAR BEFORE KINDERGARTEN SHOULD A PARENT OR GUARDIAN REQUESTS THAT. WE KNOW THAT CURRENTLY THERE IS A BIG PUSH FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. HOWEVER THESE PROGRAMS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK FOR WORKING FAMILIES WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS OPERATE ON A SCHOOL YEAR OR SCHOOL DAY SCHEDULE SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN AREAS AS WE HEARD FROM OUR PARENTS EARLIER TODAY. WE DO NOT WANT WORKING FAMILIES TO LOSE THEIR FULL TIME FULL YEAR SUBSIDIZED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND HAVE TO BE MOVED INTO THESE OTHER. PROGRAMS AND LOSE THEIR PLACEMENT. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE LOST SO MANY CHILD CARE FACILITIES JUST ILLUSTRATED IN YOUR DOCUMENT OVER THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED FACILITIES HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS A COMBINATION OF CENTER BASED FACILITIES AND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES. NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN FACILITIES AS YOU EXPAND ACCESS CONSIDER EXPANDING FACILITY FUNDS SO THAT OTHER CONTRACTING CENTER BASED AGENCIES CAN TAKE OVER THE LEASES ARE GETTING TO THE PROPERTY OF THESE CLOSED PROGRAMS BEFORE THEY ARE RENOVATED OR CHANGED COMPLETELY. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT USE OF ONE TIME ONLY FINES. ADDITIONALLY CROSS FOR PROVIDERS ON FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS MANY PROGRAMS HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I NEED FUNDS TO EXPAND THEIR PROGRAMS TO SERVE MORE CHILDREN INCLUDING INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE REQUESTS AND IDEAS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AHEAD OF THEM YOU MAY REALIZE. NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN THE EASY WORK FORCE TO INCREASE RATES TO PAY LIVABLE WAGES AND TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM. DIRECT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS AND VOUCHERS IT IS THE TIME TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR EXCESS FAT AND INVEST IN QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION AND CARE FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU IN COMING MONTHS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT SHARES. THANK YOU VERY UCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE KIDS SHOULDN'T ZOO WE HOPE WE ARE PRONOUNCED YOUR NAME CORRECTLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK. GOOD AFTERNOON IT WAS CLOSE TO- MY NAME IS QI ESSENCE THEY RE ON THE PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NETWORK A MEMBER AGENCY OF ALL OF THAT SHOULD HAVE MOST OF THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES AND OUR STATE. MORE THAN A YEAR AGO CHILD CARE WITH THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. WEEKS BEFORE FULL SHUTDOWN BECAME A REALITY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND FOOD. THEY NEEDED TO CONTINUE CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN. ALMOST OVERNIGHT MANY CHILD CARE CENTERS FOUND THEMSELVES FORCED TO CLOSE. AS NEW COHORT GUIDANCE PREVENTED THEM FROM CARING FOR ENOUGH CHILDREN. TO BE ABLE TO PAY STAFF. RENT AND MORTGAGES. HOME BASED PROVIDERS WERE AT COSTCO AND SAM'S CLUB WITH THE REST OF US. TRYING TO GET PAPER TOWELS TOILET PAPER. AND CLEANING SPRAY. YEAH PERSISTED. THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT OUT INTO THE OPEN. THE WEAKNESSES OF OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM AND THE RESILIENCY OF ITS WORK FORCE. DESPITE HIM MORALLY LOW WAGES PAID TO CHILD CARE WORKERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WHEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS NEEDED CARE OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD PROFESSIONALS WITH THEIR- TAKING ON THE RISK OF ILLNESS OFTEN WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. AND DESPITE THE FRAGILE HEALTH OF THEIR OWN FAMILY MEMBERS CHILDCARE PROVIDERS FAMILIES CHILDREN ALL EXPERIENCED A MASS TRAUMA. CHILDREN LOSING PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS PROVIDERS BECOMING ILL OR THEMSELVES LOSING THEIR LIVES WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH QUITE A YEAR. TODAY CALIFORNIA HAS LOST A THIRD OF ITS CHILD CARE CENTERS AND 14% OF CHILD CARE HOMES BUT IN SOME COUNTIES THOSE NUMBERS ARE WELL OVER 50% PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AS I STATED BEFORE CHILD CARE WAS ALREADY SCARCE. AS GOVERNOR YOU SOME PROMISES CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WILL OPEN JUNE FIFTEENTH WE ARE ALL RIGHT FOR A RUDE AWAKENING. PARENTS WHO KEPT THEIR CHILDREN HOME THIS YEAR MAY FIND THE CARE THEY KNEW AND LOVED IS GONE. AND A NEW ONE WILL BE HARDER TO FIND THAN EVER BEFORE. ACCORDING TO THE UC BERKELEY CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF CHILD CARE EMPLOYMENT. THE CHILD CARE WORK FOR SHARKS 20% OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. NO IT'S NOT ONLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE RAISE THE RATES AND WAGES FOR CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. PROVIDE ACCESS FOR ALL FAMILIES TO THE CARE THEY NEED AND WANT BUT WE ALSO MUST SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S WELL ESTABLISHED INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT IT'S BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. FOR MOST OF US KNEW WHAT HIT US.

OUR NEXT IS DENISE GOWER A PROVIDER WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DENISE KELLER I'M A FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDER IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE OVER FORTY THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS REPRESENTED BY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS UNITED CCPO. AS THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS APPEAR FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WE HOPE THE FUTURE IN OUR HANDS EVERY DAY. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IF WE WANT THE FUTURE TO BE ONE OF EQUITY PROSPERITY AND PROMISE YOU NEED TO TAKE ACTION RIGHT NOW TO FIX OUR BROKEN CHILD CARE SYSTEM. I HAVE BEEN A PROVIDER FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. THIS IS NOT WORK YOU DO TO GET RICH HEY. THIS IS. YOU DO IT BECAUSE IT IS YOUR CALLING. I BELIEVE THAT PUTS YOU WHERE YOU ARE NEEDED. MY PURPOSE IS TO CARE FOR AND EDUCATE OUR YOUTH. THE PANDEMIC SHOWED EVERYONE HOW IMPORTANT WE ARE. WE PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING. BUT THE SACRIFICES WE MADE FOR REWARDED WITH HARDSHIPS. ON MARCH SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY I HAD FOURTEEN CHILDREN ENROLLED AND FOR EMPLOYEES. MY CHAPTER WAS SMALL BUT THRIVING. AND I HAD IT GENERATED A GROSS INCOME OF OVER SIX FIGURES AND TWENTY NINETEEN. IN THE PANDEMIC FORCED US TO CLOSE FOR SIX MONTHS. THE FAMILIES THAT I SERVE ALSO THROWN INTO CHAOS. SOME COULDN'T WORK SOME RELIED ON FAMILY MEMBERS. I WENT FROM HAVING A NICE SAVINGS AND A FLOURISHING BUSINESS TO HAVING TO ASK MY FATHER FOR MONEY TO PAY MY RENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. I HAVE SPENT EVERYTHING I HAD TRYING TO SURVIVE. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INDEPENDENT TO NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MYSELF WAS DRAMATIC AND I FELT HELPLESS. THE PANDEMIC FLATLINE SO MANY OF US OVER SIX THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS CLOSED BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC. AND MANY ARE NOT COMING BACK. BEING A FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDER IS A CAREER THIS IS OUR PROFESSION. OUR BUSINESS SHOULD NOT BE CONTINGENT UPON THE SEASON WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WEATHER THINGS LIKE A PANDEMIC.AND STILL BE THERE WHEN IT'S OVER TO SERVE THE FAMILIES THAT RELY ON US. BUT WE RELY ON A VERY THIN MARGIN THAT LEAVES US VULNERABLE WHEN THE CRISIS HIT. CONSIDER THIS THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM PAYS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A WEEK FOR NON FAT. MOST PARENTS WORK FORTY HOURS WITH TRAVEL TIME THEIR CHILDREN WILL BE WITH ME FOR FIFTY HOURS A WEEK. DIVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT BY FIFTY AND IT COMES TO FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY SIX CENTS AN HOUR AND THAT'S BEFORE I HAD PAID FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT IT COST ME. TO CARE FOR A BABY. BABIES ARE WORTH MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY SIX AN HOUR. HI I'M WORTH MORE THAN FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR. AND IT FOR NOT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT OUR SOCIETY. YES MY WORK IS A LABOR OF LOVE BUT I CAN'T PAY MY BILLS AND EXPENSES WITH LOVE. WE NEED A STABLE ROBUST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AT THE BARGAINING TABLE REAL TARGETED INVESTMENTS THAT RETAIN AND ATTRACT THE MOST TALENTED AND DEDICATED EARLY LEARNING CARE PROFESSIONALS TO DO THIS WORK. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS LIKE ME HAVE ACCESS TO BENEFITS LIKE. HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE AND CONTINUING EDUCATION. AND WE NEED WILL RETIREMENT SECURITY AS IT IS NOW I DON'T SEE HOW I WILL BE ABLE TO RETIRE AT SIXTY FIVE. OR EVER. WE ARE ALSO BARGAINING TO MAKE QUALITY CHILD CARE MORE AFFORDABLE SO THAT ALL THE CHILDREN HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED REGARDLESS OF RACE INCOME OR WHERE THEY LIVE. THAT MEANS FINDING VOUCHERS FOR THE MORE THAN ONE MILLION ZERO TO THREE YEAR OLDS WHO QUALIFY AND FOR EXPANDING CARE TWO EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS. WE ALSO WANT IMPROVEMENTS TO STREAMLINE HOW CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM WORKS BY IMPROVING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT EVERYONE RECEIVES THE SAME INFORMATION REGARDING STATE POLICIES. WE DO APPRECIATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE SO FAR TO IMPROVE CHILD CARE. BUT THERE IS MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. WE ARE ASKING FOR AT THE BARGAINING TABLE IS THAT THE STATE GIVE US SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRECIOUS ASSETS. OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL AND- AMONG THE LAST OF OUR PANELISTS NOT THE LEAST IS ANGIE GARLAND. FROM THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR HAVING. I'M ANTI RIGHT LEFT WE ARE A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FINANCE. RESISTANCE ABOUT HOUSING AND BUILDING SHOCKER CELLS SOMETIMES YEAH. SHE'S AT. ME RESPONDED BY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT. SPORTS AND IT'S NOT WRITERS AND SOME CENTERS AND HELP OPERATORS. BANK WORKING IN THE SPACE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AMBASSADOR MANAGE THIS. YES AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT. THIS IS A SPACE. SERVICE FACILITIES ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED- TEACHER. NOT JUST THE TEACHER NOT JUST YEARS BUT WHEN BAYERN THAT SUPPORTS CHILDREN AND PROVIDE. SPACES AS WELL AS OUR OWN SAFETY FACTORS LIKE VENTILATION J. O. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES A BREATHABLE WORKPLACE BENEFITS EARLY STOP ASKING US. BACK A GREAT PLACE. TO WORK AS WELL AS H. AS OUR HOUSTON VERSUS THAT WHILE DOCTOR SUCH SPIKE THE- THANK. RIGHT EXACERBATE EXACERBATED IT YEAH THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS. JUST ONE DATA POINT IN THIS STATE LESS THAN 10% OF ELIGIBLE. FARMERS ACTUALLY. THANKS SIR BUT THE NEED IS IT'S A ONE HUNDRED SPOT BASS. AND NOT JUST WORK FORCE AND THE STRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE BEST TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS BUT WE ALSO NEED A SERVICE AND PHYSICAL STRUCTURE. WE APPRECIATE THE SENSE OF COMMITMENT SOON SOME SAY SINCE THEN SOME OF THE SMALL PART OF. AND SO WHAT KINDS OF INVESTMENTS RIGHT IT ALSO MEANS IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE OF CONSTRUCTION. IT IS JUST AS ESSENTIAL AS ROADS AND BRIDGES. ARE FOR FAMILIES TO GET TO WORK AT A BARRIER IS THAT THERE IS NO MONEY OUT OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL LEVELS. PLEASE PROVIDERS DON'T PLAN FOR WAR IN HISTORY UNLESS THE NUMBER SIGN. SO IT COULD TAKE TIME TO DEVELOP A PIPELINE PROJECT. WHEN ARE. WE THANK APPLE. THANK THE ONLY SPENDING MUST INCLUDE CENTERS AS WELL AS DAMAGE OUT THERE. BECAUSE WE NEED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE AXLES ASK ME ABOUT THE PROBATION SERVICE. OUR EXAMPLE LIVE THE PRODUCTS ABOUT SUPPORT AND SHOCK WINDS START UP GRANTS EXPANSION GRANTS. SO THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THE STOCK WAS. SOLD A SOURCE OF WATER WHAT ARE THINGS ARE PROVIDERS OTHERWISE STAND. SO THEY DID THINGS LIKE INFO SEPTEMBER WHICH- IT'S CONVERTED BACKYARD SPACE TO MOVE AROUND OUTSIDE SEVEN HOURS. APPLIANCES LIKE WASHERS DRYERS THAT WAY BECAUSE OF INCREASED NEWS. AND THEN I ALSO NEED VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOX NEWS AND JUST WANTS TO GET GRANTS BACK. ALL DURING THE SMALL DEMOCRATS INCREASE ON SOCIAL ASSISTANCE SO WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FUNDING TO BUILD A SERVICE. ASKED AN EXAMPLE WE OFTEN ALLOCATE OR THINK THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO START BUT- FOR CENTRE. BACK CHILDREN BUT WE ALSO JUST FINANCE CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT WAS A STANDALONE CENTER THAT SHE- WON'T GET OUT STEP BACK. THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE- FINALLY I'M SURE THIS SUMMER FOR HER IT WAS RECOMMENDED AND THEN ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS RESTORATION EXISTING. FINANCE THAT WAS ZEROED OUT. AND BASED ON SOME COST OWN THANK YOU FOR HER THAT'S ACROSS TO MEET ALL THESE NEEDS IT'S ACTUALLY. SENSIBLE THIS IS A GREAT. INITIAL REQUEST. THESE ARE GREAT USE OF ONE TIME MONEY. AND I GOT ALL MY IS. ACTUALLY ALLOWED IN I LOVE HOME AND CERTAIN SOME OF THE STIMULUS SPENDING AND MORE FEDERAL. FUNDS BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH HE NEEDS TO HELP. ENSURE THAT NEED BACKSTAGE MONEY. FEDERAL MONEY CAMPBELL. OPERATIVELY THAT. HELPS STATES UNDERSTAND OUR FEDERAL THE MONEY IS FOR. THIS IS JUST PART OF THE SOLUTION S. RIGHT YEAH FIVE HELP LEVERAGE PUBLIC FUNDING PACKAGE SIGNING SO THE PUBLIC FUNDING IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION THIS IS IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAKE FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ENGINE FOR SEVEN SORRY AS ONE. OF ITS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS SO THAT COMPLETES THE PRESENTATIONS OF THE. EIGHT PANELISTS WE HAD ON THIS ITEM. A LET ME JUST SAY I HAVE SOME QUESTION BUT I'M GOING TO GO IN A SECOND TO SEE IF THE COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE QUESTIONS FIRST. BUT IT SEEMS THAT ANYTHING I WAS THINKING OF ASKING GOT COVERED IN SOME WAY IN THIS AND IT'S ONLY A QUESTION IN MY VIEW OF DRAWING OUT SOME OF THE PANELISTS AND- OR MAYBE ALLOWING A FEW OF THE OTHERS TO RESPOND TO OTHERS AND SO- AND I KNOW WE HAVE FIFTEEN PANELISTS ON THE NEXT ITEM SO. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD SO LET ME ASK. COLLEAGUES IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE FIRM CHAIR EIGHT MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- AND I WOULD AGREE I THOUGHT THE PRESENTATIONS WERE- WELL DONE AND CERTAINLY- OUTLINED I THINK SOME OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE SENATE'S. BILL BACK BOLDLY BUDGET PLAN- CAN I SAY HELLO TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND CHRISTINE FIGUEROA I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE BEFORE SHE WAS A MOM- IT WAS NICE TO SEE HER AND- AND HOPEFULLY THINGS ARE GOING WELL- AND I GUESS IT JUST WON'T WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN OVERSTATE THE FACT THAT AS AS WE ALL WENT INTO THIS PANDEMIC- FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS WHO CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK DESPITE HUGE DIFFICULTIES. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT- A LOT OF OUR CHILD CARE WORKERS. AND SUBSTRATE SHALL CARE ARE SOME OF THE VERY PEOPLE WHO WERE IMPACTED THE WORST MICHAEL WOULD TEND TO BE PEOPLE WITH. AS KNOW WE DON'T PAY VERY WELL LOWER SOCIAL ECONOMIC- AS WELL AS OFTENTIMES PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY THOSE ALSO IMPACTED BY. BY COVERT AND HEALTH RELATED ISSUES SO- I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE THAT WE BUILD OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM BACKED. UP SOME OF THIS ONE TIME FUNDING GOING FOR FACILITIES AT A POTENTIALLY CLOSER OR HAVE NEEDED TO REHAB IS IMPERATIVE. AND I GUESS THE ONLY QUESTION I WOULD HAVE FOR SOME OF THE PANELIST IS- AND I THINK WE'RE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF T. K. BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR CHILD CARE SLOTS BECAUSE WE KNOW. AS MUCH AS PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST EIGHT TO FIVE DURING THE DAY WHEN. SOMEONE'S GOING TO AN OFFICE TO WORK BUT THEY ARE. AROUND THE CLOCK AND ARE LOWER. OR LOWER WAGE WORKERS ARE SERVICE INDUSTRY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHILD HERE SOMEWHERE. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK HOW I KNEW THE PANELISTS IF THEY CAN TALK ABOUT. THEIR THINKING ABOUT MORE CHILD CARE SLOTS VERSUS. A UNIVERSAL T. K. WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THAT FIRST OKAY. ALSO ALL STAR AND THEN I'M SURE NINA WILL. JUMP IN AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND- I THINK WE ARE ALL. CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A REALLY CRITICAL TIMES FOR OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WHICH SERVES ALL CHILDREN. ZERO THROUGH TWELVE NOT JUST ONE AGE GROUP. AND THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR FAMILIES NEED CHOICE. AND CALIFORNIA IS- LARGE DIVERSE STATE. IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL STATE. AND I THINK THAT CONCERNS MANY OF US HAVE WITH THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL. IS IT TAKES THE PARENT CHOICE OUT. AND GIVES THEM A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO I THINK THAT WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT THE T. K. SERVICES CAN BE PART OF A BROADER PRESCHOOL SYSTEM UNIVERSAL PRE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN THE STATE. BUT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A MIXED A LIVERY MODEL AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES. THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR PROGRAMS THEY HAVE DONE IT. IN CONCERT WITH. THEIR CHILD CARE SYSTEM AND LIFTED UP THEIR CHILD CARE SYSTEM RATHER THAN HELD IT DOWN AND DIMINISHED IT. AND THAT INCLUDED. CHILD CARE CENTER FAMILY CHILD CARE AND ALSO OUR- OUR FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO'S BEEN FILLING A GOOD DEAL OF THE GAP. DURING THIS CRISIS SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE CHILD CARE PIECES RIGHT FIRST WE'VE GOT TO GET COMPENSATION RATE WERE FAR BEHIND ON PAYING PEOPLE ADEQUATE WAGES. AND SEQUENCING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING AND HAVING A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS AN IMPORTANT THING. SO THAT WE CAN MEET ALL CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHERE THEY ARE AND GIVE THEM CHOICES THAT BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS. THANK YOU- YES GO HEAD TO. FROM THE PRINTER- I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON TO- DONNA'S COMMENTS THE I REALLY C. T. K. AS PART OF THE SYSTEM THERE IS ONLY LIKE HEAD START AS PART OF THE SYSTEM STATE PRESCHOOL AS PART OF THE SYSTEM AND ABOUT YOUR CARE FIELD IS PART OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL. WE CANNOT UNDER RESOURCE ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM FOR ANOTHER PART OF THE SYSTEM THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE CHOOSING TO K. ARE VERY DIFFERENT FAMILIES SPEND POTENTIALLY THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEAD START PROGRAM DOES THAT ARE RECEIVING A VOUCHER FOR A WEEKEND OR AFTER HOURS CARE AND EQUALLY THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING A STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THE PARENTAL CHOICE IS 1100% KEENEY I'M AS WE LEARN FROM OUR WONDERFUL FAMILIES TODAY WE CON ASK THEM TO TRADE ONE FULL DAY FULL YEAR PROGRAM FOR A SCHOOL DAY SCHOOL YEAR PROGRAM IT'S UNFAIR ASGHAR LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO MAKE THAT CHOICE IT'S- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ACCESS WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS WAITING LIST IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS TO HEAD START THERE ARE A LOT OF FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THEM ALL SET FOR ME T. K. AS ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT THAT PARENTAL CHOICE IS KEY BECAUSE AGAIN WE CANNOT PUT THIS CHOICE BEFORE FAMILIES AGAIN RISKING THEIR FULL DAY FULL YEAR CARE FOR A PARK. A SCHOOL YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU N. MARKET YOU OF YOUR HAND. THAT EARLY HERE WHERE MY CHILD FROM WHEN HE WAS. EVEN SMALLER. HI. IT TOOK ME A LONG. PROFESSIONS TO THEN GET ME THE REFERRAL. DISTRICT AND THEN GET ACCESS MEANT FOR HIM IT WAS LIKE. ATTIC AND NINETEEN BY THAT TIME I HAD MISSED ALREADY SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES HE COULD'VE BEEN GETTING SERVICES FROM EARLY ON SO THEY SAID WELL YOU KNOW WHAT IF WE CAN'T HELP HIM ANYMORE BECAUSE HE'S NOW THIS AGE AND ALL OF YOU WERE. YOU KNOW SO. I THINK THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR TKO PROGRAMS AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL FAMILIES FOR ALL KIDS WHO NEEDED AN EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS. CAN BENEFIT. FROM THIRD TO UP TO THIRTEEN YEARS OLD EVEN CHILD KERR STOLE CENTRAL BECAUSE- CHILD CARE IS NOT A ONE SIZE. FITS ALL SITUATION PARENTS WORKING. GET TOLD. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH OF THOSE WORK FOR ALL FAMILIES TO KEEP FAMILIES WORKING KEEP KIDS LEARNING IS WHICH BRINGS THAT HAS KEPT WITH ME AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. I THANK YOU FOR THE SPACE. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE CAN HEAR OTHER PEOPLE LEARNING IN THE BACKGROUND THERE SIR. I'M SORRY DON'T I DON'T BE SORRY AT ALL IT IS VERY THEMATIC WE APPRECIATE IT. SENATOR MITCHELL SAID OR DID THAT COMPLETE I THOUGHT THAT COMPLETED YET THAT I JUST I JUST WANT TO DO IS JUST TO SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT WE KNOW THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN WOMEN AND WORKING WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR AND- WOMEN WITH LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS SO WE WANT EVERYONE TO GET BACK TO WORK AND WE CERTAINLY DO. THEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CHILD CARE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY IN ADDITION TO. THE SENATE'S BILL BACK PROBABLY AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WE ALSO ASK FOR. IN THE TWO HUNDRED SLOTS IN CHILDCARE AND TO BE ABLE TO WAIVE FEES AND TO RAISE REIMBURSEMENT RATES SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONSISTENCY AND NOT AND WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS ASKED FOR AND- AT THE SENATE IN OUR BILL BACK PULLED THE PLANNING AND WE HOPE TO SEE THESE THINGS COME TO FRUITION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS- CENTER MAN AND THEN AFTERWARDS. I'M GONNA GO TO CENTER OF TROUBLED. THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY REALLY APPRECIATE- BACK INSIDE. I AND I THINK YOU'VE ALL EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF TRYING TO BUILD BACK BETTER ALL OUR- CHILD CARE. SYSTEM AND THE VARIOUS SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY- A LOT OF WORKING FAMILIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CRITICAL CHILD CARE AND- AS A FATHER OF THREE YOUNG CHILDREN MYSELF I. KNOW IT'S BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK WITHOUT TOP CARE. PROPERTY THESE DAYS WITH MOST FAMILIES BEING EITHER SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS- TWO WORKER HOUSEHOLDS- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION- YOU KNOW I KNOW IN OTHER CONTEXTS. SOME OF THE EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR COVETED- PROGRAMS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE. I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES JUST LIKE AS FAR AS PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING AND BEING AWARE THAT THESE EXIST PARTICULARLY- COMMUNITIES. OF COLOR COMMUNITIES HOUSEHOLDS WHERE ENGLISH IS NOT THE FIRST LANGUAGE- A DO WE HAVE A SIMILAR POTENTIAL CHALLENGE WITH WITH. JUST MAKING PARENTS AWARE. OF SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO THEM IS THAT IT'S- SOMETHING YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN OR IS THAT. IT REALLY JUST EVERYBODY NEEDS CHILD CARE SO IT'S NOT REALLY CONCERNED I JUST LOVE TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND ARE YOU DIRECTING THAT QUESTION TO SOMEONE OR IS IT EVERYONE FOR THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT QUESTION BE DIRECTED TO LA- AND THEN ANY OF THE- OTHER CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE POLICY GROUPS OUT THERE THAT MIGHT HAVE A PERSPECTIVE. ON THIS THANK YOU MISS CORTES. YES THANK YOU I SEE THAT MR INTEREST WANTS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION SO I'LL CHECK I'LL TAKE THE FIRST STEP AND THEN- ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT- J. P. AGENCIES ADDRESS CONTRACT PROVIDERS DO NOTE THAT THERE ARE VERY LONG WAITING LISTS- SO. I THINK THE WAY IT WORKS ON THE GROUND FROM- FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT FAMILIES ARE KIND OF ARE AWARE- OF THE CHILD CARE SERVICES GO TO AN H. P. AGENCY- OR GO TO THE DIRECT CONTRACTOR DIRECTLY WHICH IT COULD BE A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR A- OR A LOCAL. ORGANIZATION BUT I'M SURE MY SURGERY CAN COME. OUT ON SET ON TO THEM. THANK YOU. S. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR I DEAD CHILD CARE. LOCAL CHILDCARE AGENCY IS THAT SOMETIMES ARE REFERRED TO AS RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. SOMETIMES AS AGE HE IS- OFTEN WE ARE BOTH IN THE SAME. OUR PRIMARY JOB IS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT CHILD CARE AND THAT HAPPENS THROUGH. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODALITIES WHETHER THAT'S ON THE TELEPHONE. LINE OR- THROUGH COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT IN BANDS. OFTEN PARENTS FIND US THROUGH A CHILD CARE PROVIDER BECAUSE THE PROVIDERS FALL. OR IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE WITH PAYMENT- I AND I DO KNOW THAT AS THESE PROGRAMS TRANSITION TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THERE ARE. PLANS AND HOPEFULLY PLANS WITH SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR. TO BUILD OUT THAT- LOCAL COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH RESOURCE CENTER FOR ALL. TO EXPAND THAT REACH- EXPAND THAT REACH ON SOCIAL MEDIA EXPAND THAT REACH ALL THE PLACES PARENTS ARE. ARE PART OF OUR CHARGE- AS THESELOCAL CHILDCARE AGENCIES IS TO BE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH HAS BEEN A LITTLE DIFFICULT. WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT WE REALLY HAVE RESPONDED BY BEING AVAILABLE WITH FOOD AND SUPPLIES AND ALL THE THINGS. THAT MY COLLEAGUE CATION BROUGHT. A ALSO DO AS- ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FAMILIES MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR WHETHER THAT IS A HEAD START PROGRAM A STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. AND WE REALLY WORK WITH THE FAMILY TO CREATE A PLAN THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE SECOND PLEASE YOUR QUESTION THEN LET'S GO TO SANDRA CHART BOOK. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. RUSSIAN S. TO THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO BRING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR PROVIDERS UP TO THE MOST RECENT SURVEY. WHICH I BELIEVE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND I BELIEVE DO WE EVER COMPLETE A TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY OUR SURVEY OR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE PLAN ON THAT AND- BURN UPDATED SURVEY. THE THIRD GRADE WITH THE LA L. SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TWENTY TWENTY SURVEY ON MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SO IT WAS. DELAYED A LITTLE BIT- SO THERE WILL BE A TWENTY TWENTY ONE SURVEYS MIGHT MY EXISTING UNDERSTANDING. COME IN TERMS OF MOVING THE CAR THE COST OF MOVING TO THE MOST RECENT- REGIONAL MARKET RATE- AND SHOULD HAVE THE COST OF A- I'M- I'M- I'M TRYING TO FIND IT IN MY FILES IN THIS MOMENT WHICH IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT. GREAT IDEA- BUT I GUESS IT. WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF. WHAT KIND OF PERSON HOW YOU WANT TO GO TO SO THAT'S KIND OF. I'M TOO TO INCREASE RATE- YOU CAN MOVE TO THE MOST RECENT SURVEYING KEEP AT THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE- BUT THERE'S ALSO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT SOME LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGE TO MOVE G. EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE SO THAT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COST TO JUST MOVING TO THE MOST RECENT SURVEY. AND THEY'RE ALL JUST HOP IN AND I BELIEVE THAT YOUR ESTIMATES FOR THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WERE JUST SHY OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OBVIOUSLY MOVING UP TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH WOULD BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER. AND THEN- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RATE REFORM OVER TIME WOULD MOVE ALL PROVIDERS- THAT INTO A HIGHER CATEGORY. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF LEVERS AT PLAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DID I DID- I DID. EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING TO THE 70% OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION- AND MOVING TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY IT'S FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING HIM IN THE RIGHT REFORM HE SAYS NOT JUST INCLUDING- AFTER DOCTOR SIDE- OF. THESE PROGRAMS. SO TO. SUM I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD MY APOLOGIES AND SO I MEAN I'M PRETTY AGAIN SO THAT WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE VOUCHER SIDE OF THE PROGRAM IF WE'RE LOOKING AT RATE REFORM AND WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE OFF THE DIRECT CONTRACTING PROGRAMS TRUE THAT. EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE THAT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL FINES THAT WE WOULD ESTIMATE AROUND THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ADDITIONALLY TO GET THEM UP TO THAT LEVEL AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES SUBSIDIZED AT THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WHICH IS A SINGLE. RATE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SANDRA TROUBLE. THANK YOU MR CHAIR SURGES. AND THIS IS TO THE EIGHTY FIVE PERCENTILE OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN- ON. SURVEYS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT SO A TOTAL OF. ALMOST A BILLION TO GET IT UP TO PAR. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT I'M GOING TO ASSUME I'M WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WHAT I. RECALL FROM OUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION IS THAT IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS END AND MAKE IT STANDARD- WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT IN STATUTE- THE AUTOMATIC INCREASES TO THESE FEES MOVING FORWARD. IS THAT CORRECT. WHO'S YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO THE I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE OKAY THANK YOU. YES SO CURRENTLY IN STATUTE RUNS THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY WERE STILL AT THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEYS ABOUT STATUTORY CHANGE TO MOVE INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY SO ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD BE AT THE SUGGESTION. TO MAKE IT AUTOMATIC SO WHENEVER THERE'S A NEW SURVEY- THERE THERE COULD BE THERE COULD BE INCREASES- THE USING THAT WOULD BE AUTOMATIC THAT. CHILD. CARE PROVIDERS WOULD USE SETTING SPRAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THEN ONE LAST QUESTION AND- AND THIS IS. A LEAVE THAT UP TO THE CHAIR TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ANSWER AT THIS TIME BUT- IF WE CAN GET IT UPDATED- THE TRANSFER OF STATE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CALIFORNIA PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FROM THE C. D. E. TO THE D. S. S. AND WHO YOU ARE ASKING. FOR- ARE YOU ASKING THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TO GIVE YOU THAT UPDATE- GOOD QUESTION YES PRINT I AM HAPPY TO HAPPY TO GIVE THAT UPDATE SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES I'M TRANSITIONING CHILDCARE PROGRAMS FROM SEED TO CVS- AND SO THIS IS A CHEF SO THERE'S GOING TO COST NEUTRAL COMPONENTS OF THIS- THIS PIECE AND PART OF IT AND IT'S THE FIRST COMPONENT IS THAT IT'S A COST NEUTRAL SHIFT OF OBSTRUCTING THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUND SO IT'S ABOUT. THREE BILLION- SHIFTING FROM SEED TO CDS OF CRIMES THAT ARE GOING TO GO TO LOCALS TO PROVIDE SHELTER SERVICES BUT ALSO ADD THAT IF THERE'S ALSO A NUTRITION PROGRAM- ADDED TO THE LIST THEN THE OTHER PIECE IS THE OPERATIONS SO ALL OF THE STAFFING OF THE STATE. AND LET ME JUST MAYBE INTERVENE FOR SECOND BECAUSE WE HAD A HEARING ON THIS AND I SUSPECTED DISSENTERS ASKING FOR JUST CURRENT UPDATE OUT TO JUST KNOW THE STATUS OF HOW THAT. TRANSITION IS HAPPENING. SO IT. ARE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT YOU NEED GIVE IT NOW NEED YOU SHOULD PROVIDE IT TO THE SENATOR AND THEN COPY ALL OF US ON THE COMMITTEE'S. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR TROUBLE DID THAT- COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONING- YES OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN. I'M JUST GONNA RATHER THAN ASK MORE QUESTIONS. JUST MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT BECAUSE- I. HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE FOR LONGER THAN I CARE TO ADMIT- AS A COUNTY PERSON. CHOIR FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AGO WE REALLY DID STUDIES AND EXPANDED CARE AND HAD SOME OF THE FIRST TODDLER CARE. AND IT HAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAT FUNDED AS THE CHAIR OF THE LOCAL CHILD CARE COUNCIL. AND EVEN THOUGH WE MADE PROGRESS BECAUSE THERE WERE DISHED OUT PROGRAMS THAT CAME FROM THE STATE FOR DIGITAL ABILITIES AND- AND SOMETIMES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD GET IN WHERE THEY HADN'T BEEN IN BEFORE AND OTHER THINGS. SOME OF THE BASIC ISSUES JUST REMAIN THE SAME WHETHER PAYING WORKERS ENOUGH WHETHER THRE ARE ENOUGH SLOTS WHETHER THERE'S TODDLER CARE. OF WHETHER THIS INTEGRATES BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS IN A GOOD WAY. THOSE STILL EXIST I THINK WE HEARD FROM OUR EIGHT PANELISTS EXACTLY THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT SENDER AIKMAN WAS SAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME WE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY DO ONE BIG SIGNIFICANT THING ABOUT IT IT WANTS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS. THAT AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHY I SEE HEADS NODDING AND PEOPLE FEELING LIKE. A WE WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING THIS MONEY AVAILABLE TO TRY TO JUMP THESE THINGS UP TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCESO- THAT'S WHY APPRECIATE EVERYBODY THAT TESTIFIED TODAY I APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL THAT'S COMING FROM THE SENATE. AND I AM CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT'S IN THE MAY REVISE IT WHEN WE GET INTO THE FINE DETAIL. AND THEN I THINK IT'S OUROBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE WE DO MOVE AHEAD IN ORDER FOR THE ACTIONS. OF SO WITH THAT. OUR GOING TO MOVE TO A NUMBER. BUT WHEN WE TO ISSUE NUMBER. A CENTER EIGHT MINUTES GOING TO CHAIR THIS PART OF THE HEARING SO. I'M GOING TO GIVE HER THE GAVEL AND SHE CAN HANDLE THE UNRULY PEOPLE- WELL THIS IS GOING ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CURE LAYERED OKAY NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH HAS TO DO WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OKAY AND ISSUE NUMBER ONE- IT'S A PACKAGE OF THE SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS IN WE HEARD THESE IN JANUARY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE LA- WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING AT THIS TIME BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ASK- DIRECTLY MAYBE WE- WILL LIVE BORN HAD TO BE DOING IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE US ANY KIND OF UPDATE ON THESE THREE. THESE THREE PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN AFTER THAT WILL WE WILL BE IF THEY SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY TO US AND THEN AFTER THAT WE WILL FOLLOW- WITH SOME PANELISTS TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES- HELLO DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO START WITH. THANK YOU SENATOR ECONOMIC. ISSUE TO WITH THE LMAO- WE AS AS HE NOTED YOU KNOW WE RODE UP- THESE PROPOSALS IN JANUARY DON'T DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY SORT OF FURTHER COMMENTS TO ADD ON TOP OF WHAT WE RODE UP IN JANUARY- JUST TO SORT OF REITERATE- YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR COMMENTS FROM- JANUARY VERY VERY BRIEFLY- ON THE- TWO PROPOSALS FOR- FUNDING THROUGH THE- METAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT. AND THE PROBLEM MANY EIGHT- THE FUNDS WE ARE RECOMMENDING REJECTION OF THE- NINETY EIGHT COMPONENT OF THAT BUT APPROVAL OF THE- AC PORTION. AND THEN FOR THE US. SERVICES THROUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE WOULD JUST SORT OF NOTE THAT- ARE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT SORT OF COORDINATION BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- INTO SEASON AND BY A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES I'M STILL STAND WITHIN THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. QUITE A SIGNIFICANT LIFT IN THAT COORDINATION IS REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO BE- A CENTRAL THEME OF THIS OF THIS PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD SO. THOSE ARE JUST OUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND I GUESS IT JUST IT JUST BEAR SAYING AS WHAT WE'RE ALL SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING AT THESE THREE CONCRETE PROPOSALS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT. IN IN JANUARY AND EARLIER IN THE YEAR. THAT YESTERDAY THE ADMINISTRATION MADE SOME PRETTY BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT SOME NEW PROGRAMS ARE COMING ON BOARD- AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OF THAT OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS HERE TO HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE IF THESE NEW INITIATIVES- THERE'S YET. ANOTHER UNKNOWN KIND OF INITIATIVE OUT THERE AND WE AND WE ARE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT HOW ALL THESE THINGS ARE GONNA WORK TOGETHER- AND I WERE WONDERING IF YOU CAN GET A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ON THAT TODAY. DO EVERYTHING FIRST THE HELLO.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WE ARE WE ARE VERY EAGER TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN HOW ALL OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO INTERSECT TOGETHER- AND WE'VE HEARD WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT SOMETIMES A CONFUSION.

COLUMN LONG STANDING CONCERN ABOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH EDUCATIONAL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SP SEVENTY FIVE WORKGROUP. ALL PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO BETTER LEVERAGE MEDI CAL. THAT WORK CONTINUES IT'S CLEAR THAT THE MISSING ELEMENT HAS BEEN REALLY THE LARGEST CARD THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WHICH S MANAGED CARE. WHICH IS ALREADY PAID TO PROVIDE PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. 85% OF THE NEARLY FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WE COVER. IT IS CAROLINE'S ARE MINIMALLY CONNECTED UP A LITTLE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DESPITE THE FACT THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUDENTS THERE ARE ALREADY COVERED BY. THE PROPOSAL WE ADVANCED IN JANUARY IS DESIGNED TO PERMANENTLY REMEDY THAT. CHRIS COOPER WILL ELABORATE ON THAT IN A MOMENT. OF COURSE IS EVERYTHING AND AS SHE REFERENCED.

THAT IS A PRACTICE AND LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A MISS COOPER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL. SO WHAT ARE I WILL I'LL FIRST ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS REGARDING THAT STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES A PROPOSAL THAT IS ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY I'M SO AS WELL MENTIONED SENSE WE'VE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED ON THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN MEETING WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO THAT THE PROPOSAL FIND YOUR NICHE AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT IT IS SUCCESSFUL FOR ALL ENTITIES INVOLVED. I WE HAVE MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MULTIPLE TIMES WE'VE MET WITH MANY MANAGED CARE PLANS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR EXISTING AND OR PLANNED OUR RELATIONSHIPS- AND IT AN EXPANDED SERVICES IN THAT SPACE WE'VE MET WITH A NUMBER OF EDUCATION ADVOCATES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN OF COURSE OUR COUNTY PARTNERS WITH S. U. V. H. D. A. AND OTHERS. TO LEARN NOT ONLY WHAT INFRASTRUCTURES THERE TODAY AND HOW WE CAN BUILD OFF OF IT- AND YOU HAVE A GROW BUT HOW WE CAN LINK OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTY PARTNERS AND SCHOOL PARTNERS TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE THE PROPOSAL AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. ARE THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE REALLY TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED FROM A PLANNING AND COORDINATION POINT OF VIEW OF WHERE THEIR GAPS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE INCENTIVES COULD FUND I'M AS WELL AS EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE EARLY PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES WHERE THOSE EXIST WHERE THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT WE CAN FINE TUNE THE INCENTIVE PACKAGE FOR THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY WE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT DID DEVELOPED AND RELEASED A FACT SHEET RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS RELEASED ON APRIL SIXTEENTH AND IF YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED A COPY OF THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO I WITHIN THAT WE HAVE A BROKEN OUT SOME OF THE TYPES OF INCENTIVES THAT WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK ON FOR PEOPLE AND THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD EXPLORE. ADS MAKE OFFERED IN THIS PROPOSAL. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT VRY GOOD. TO CONTINUE STAY DURING. THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. TO FURTHER FINE TUNE OUT THE INITIATIVES THAT WERE RELEASED IN THE APRIL SIXTEENTH VERSION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE ON THE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT ON INCENTIVE PROPOSALS. WE AIM TO COMPLETE THE DESIGN OF THE INCENTIVES BY OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. TO ALLOW LOCAL ENTITIES TO BEGIN THE INCENTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER PRIOR TO THE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TO GO LIVE DATE. WE WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE IN REGARDS TO- THE YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THAT WE'RE GETTING THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY. I'M SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO IMPLEMENT THE- INTERVENTION INCENTIVES WITHIN THE FRAME WORK OF BEAT UP INCENTIVE BANDS IN OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ESSENTIALLY IT'S 5% ABOVE THE- MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. OF THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- MAYBE ONLY MADE TO THE PLANTS IF THEY MEET SPECIFIC TARGET SO IT'S NOT A GRANT PROGRAM. BUT THEY DO HAVE TO MEET THE TARGETS IN ORDER TO DRIVE DOWN THE INCENTIVES WHICH COULD INCLUDE THE REQUIRED- INVOLVEMENT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THE INCENTIVES. ARE DRYING AND ALL THE RIGHT PLAYERS IN THAT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO JUST ACHIEVE THOSE INCENTIVES WITHOUT. ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE INCENTIVE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE PUT FORWARD. ON THERE WILL BE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET YOU- RECEIVE THOSE INCENTIVES AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS AROUND HOW THE DOLLARS FLOW DOWNSTREAM. TO SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. I AT AWE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION IF IT'S IF IT'S WANTED YOU REGARDS TO THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN WHICH WE USED TO DRIVE DOWN THE SPINES THE DEPARTMENT HAS USED THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR PREVIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PILOTS THAT ARE ACTIVE RIGHT NOW- AND IT IS THE SAME FEDERAL AUTHORITY THAT WE ARE USING FOR THE CATALAN INCENTIVE PROPOSALS AS WELL. ESSENTIALLYIT IS A WAY FOR US TO INCENTIVIZE DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION- MAKE IT ACHIEVABLE AND HAVE YIELD OUTCOMES WHERE THEY DO HAVE TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES IN ORDER TO DRAW THEM DOWN THEY MUST BE TIME LIMITED THEY CANNOT BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED- AND THE DEPARTMENT MUST MAKE SURE IT ALIGNS WITH OUR QUALITY STRATEGY TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS. SO THIS ENDS MY COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF YOU DID WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO GO INTO ANY ADDITIONAL DETAIL REGARDING THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AT THIS TIME OR WHETHER THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO WAIT FOR FUTURE MAY REVISION I'M HEARING IS HAPPY TO DO. WHATEVER YOUR YOUR PREFERENCES. NO I THINK- I THINK WE'LL HEAR SOME. ALL RIGHT. SO I AS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE PROPOSAL REQUESTS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS- AND I'LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHILDREN OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- INCENTIVES OR INITIATIVES REALLY THIS IS A AN AGENCY WIDE PROPOSAL INCLUDING MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS- IT INCLUDES BOTH THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- DMH SEE OF LIKE HELP THE OFFICE OF SURGEON GENERAL AND OFF AT WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL- SO I WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW REGARDING PIECES. ON ALL PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL TODAY HOWEVER WE JUST NOTE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OUTSIDE OF WHAT YES YES WILL BE SPURS SPECIFICALLY LEADING I MAY HAVE TO DEFER THOSE TO FUTURE HEARINGS THANK YOU THE GOAL OF THE INITIATIVE IS REALLY TO TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM INTO AN INNOVATIVE UPSTREAM FOCUS ON MORE ALL CHILDREN- UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE REGARDLESS OF PAYER ARE ROUTINELY SCREENED SUPPORTED AND SERVED FOR MERGING AN EXISTING BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS. SERVICES WOULD BE STATEWIDE EVIDENCE BASED CULTURALLY. COMPETENT AND EQUITY FOCUSED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DROVE THIS IS THE TIMING IS SO CRITICAL WE HAVE LEARNED SERVING YOUNG PEOPLE AND DOING IT WELL PAYS OFF. HALF OF ALL LIFE LIFETIME CASES OF DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS BEGINS AT AGE FOURTEEN THREE FORCE OF LIKE TEN CASES ARE DIAGNOSED. ARE BEGINNING BY AGE TWENTY FIVE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS A VALUE WAITING OUR CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEMS IT IS CURRENTLY INADEQUATE AND NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF MANY. IS TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION. IT IS A SERVING TOO FEW PROGRAMS TOO FEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS READ ME THE NEEDED SERVICES. THERE ARE TOO FEW CRISIS AND EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND THERE ARE TOO FEW ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND BEDS THE PROPOSAL IS AIMING TO CLOSE MANY OF THOSE HISTORICAL GAPS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF THE MOST GLARING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE BORN IN NEXT WEEK BY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES LGBTQ COMMUNITIES AND PLACES WHERE ADVERSE CHILD EXPERIENCES ARE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THAT. THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPORTED MENTAL HEALTH IN RELATED VISITS FOR CHILDREN AGES FIVE TO ELEVEN WERE UP TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. AND YOUTH TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE PERCENT. AS A FAMILY FOUNDATION REPORTED THAT FIFTY SIX POINT 2% OF AMERICANS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. AND IN THE SAME COHORT ROUGHLY 25% DESCRIBED AN INCREASE OF ONSET OF A SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND TWENTY SIX REPORTED SERIOUS THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD IN THE MAY REVISION IS A MULTI YEAR INITIATIVE WITH ONE YOUR FOCUS WITH THE FIRST YOU'RE FOCUSED ON RESEARCH. PLANNING CAN BE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE BUILD THIS RIGHT. I'LL GO OVER THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. A NEW STATEWIDE VIRTUAL PLATFORM TO SCREEN AND PROVIDE INITIAL FOLLOW UP CARE AND TOOLS TO SUPPORT ALL YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH AGE TWENTY FIVE AS MENTIONED EARLIER EARLIER AND REGARDLESS OF PAYER I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART TO REMEMBER THIS IS NOT JUST A MEDICARE PROPOSAL IS FOR ALL CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA. THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WOULD PROVIDE INTERACTIVE EDUCATION SELF MONITORING TOOLS APPLICATION BASED GAMES VIDEOS BOOKS SUGGESTIONS AUTOMATED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND MINDFULNESS EXERCISES DESIGNED TO BUILD SKILLS AND ENHANCE WELL BEING AS WELL AS DIRECT ACCESS. TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PEERS COACHES AND LICENSED CLINICIANS THROUGH THAT PORTAL. SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED VIA A TIERED MODEL DELIVER AND MONITOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT SO THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS RESOURCE INTENSIVE TREATMENT IS BEING DELIVERED FIRST AND REFERRALS TO PLANS FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICES WOULD BE AVAILABLE. THE SYSTEM WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL POINT OF ENTRY TO ASSIST CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO CONNECT TO SERVICES. THE PLATFORM WOULD BE- BUT ALSO INCLUDE REFERRALS TO INDIVIDUALS COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS JOHNNY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES SCHOOLING TO COUNSELORS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER RESOURCES FOR HIGHER LEVEL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THOSE ARE NEEDED. ALL COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR SCHOOL COUNSELOR SERVICES. EMPLOYED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AND COUNTIES BASED ON A STATEWIDE NETWORK AND FEE SCHEDULE. THE SYSTEM WOULD ALSO CONNECT CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR CAREGIVERS TO A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN OFFER ADDITIONAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS AND WELLNESS SERVICES IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE YOU CONSOLE IN THE REFERRAL SERVICES TO ALLOW PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY PRACTICE PRACTITIONERS TO RECEDE ASYNCHRONOUS SUPPORT AND CONSULTATION TO MANAGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR PRACTICES. HOWEVER TO ACHIEVE THIS TYPE OF TRANSFORMATION WE HAVEN'T PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE. THE BUILDING UP OF THE CONTINUUM OF PROGRAMS AND WORKFORCE TO SUPPORT THE CARE FOR THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF YOUNG CALIFORNIANS. IT WOULD IMPLEMENT THE SUPPORT AND SCALE UP AND SPREAD OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS PROVEN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WITH OR AT HIGH RISK OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT THE PARTICULAR FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THEIR FIRST BREAK OR FIRST EPISODE OF PSYCHOSIS. AND FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES SIX STATEWIDE. THESE WOULD BE GRANTS THAT WE WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AFTER ENGAGING WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTAKE THAT I MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY TALKING POINTS. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD INCREASE CAPACITY PARTNERSHIPS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SCHOOLING SERVICES. BY ADDING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR COUNTIES TRIBAL ENTITIES SCHOOL. SCHOOLS COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. THESE FUNDS ARE IN ADDITION TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS DOLLARS WHICH WE JUST PRESENTED ON WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE. AND PUT FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. HOWEVER THESE FUNDS BUT FLOW DIRECTLY TO THE ENTITIES THAT I JUST REFERENCED INSTEAD NOT FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. AS A DIRECTOR LIKE BORN MENTIONED CRITICAL TO BUILD OFF OF THE PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AS WELL. WE ALSO WOULD BE EXPANDING THE OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BOTH SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS. BEHAVIOR HEALTH COACHES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE AS WELL AS THE OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS. THERE WOULD BE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO CREATE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO REDUCE THE STIGMA OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND ENCOURAGE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO SEEK THE NEEDED CARE BEFORE A CRISIS AND TO BUILD A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF ACES AND TOXIC STRESS. WE WILL ALSO BUILD ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND AS YOU D. BEDS FACILITIES AND SERVICES. AND TO PROVIDE MORE IN PERSON SERVICES WHEN NEEDED ADDING DOLLARS TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUING INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THE GOVERNOR IN JANUARY. THE FOCUS ON OFFERING SOCIAL MODELS AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS PROVIDING CRISIS STABILIZATION CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES IN A HOME LIKE SETTING AS WELL AS BUILDING OUT OUR YOUTH. AND CHILD OUTPATIENT AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH WELLNESS HUBS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE DYADIC SERVICES IN MEDICARE. WHERE THE CARE IS DELIVERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CARE GIVER AND FAMILY SO THAT FAMILIES ARE SCREENED FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROBLEMS IN OUR PERSONAL SAFETY SUBSTANCE USE AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. UP FRONT. WE ALSO WOULD BE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE EDUCATION AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO RAISE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LITERACY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO NORMALIZE AND SUPPORT THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE USE CHALLENGES TEACH CALIFORNIANS HOW TO RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND WHERE TO TURN AND ASK FOR HELP. EMPOWERING CHILDREN AND USED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS. DEVELOP A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ON ACES AND TOXIC STRESS WHICH WILL INCLUDE THELATEST EVIDENCE OF TRAUMA INFORMED IN TRAUMA SENSITIVE RESPONSES. INITIATIVE WIDE WE WOULD HAVE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR OF ALL PROGRAM COMPONENTS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST INNOVATIVE PRACTICES AND INFORM FUTURE POLICY WORK THROUGHOUT THESE MULTI YEAR INITIATIVES. THE BAT IS THE ACTUAL COLLUSION OF THE OVERVIEW OF THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE FORWARD AND THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISION WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS THIS CONTINUES THROUGH COMMITTEES AND HEARINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEBBIE DIRECTOR DEAD UBER- AND I AND I SHOULD SAY THAT I DID HAVE A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH DR KELLY YESTERDAY BEFORE THIS WAS ANNOUNCED AND- APPROPRIATE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND I AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL AGREE. ON THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AS YOU DESCRIBED IT- AND- AND WE- AND I AND I GUESS I SHOULD JUST SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE LOOKS FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND ACTUALLY FLESHING OUT THIS PROPOSAL- SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF STUFF SUCCESS AM. AND I YOU KNOW IT IS THIS IS THIS IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT I DO I WOULD JUST THINK IT BEARS. SAYING AS WE AS WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW. WITH THE ISSUES AT THE- AT THE EDT WHAT I THINK- THIS LAST WEEK THERE WAS A 6% RESPONSE TO THE CALLS AND EMAILS I CAME IN- ONLINE AND SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SENDING UP A WHOLE BRAND NEW. ONLINE SYSTEM OR THE MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE ARE GONNA BE CONTACTING IT. BEING ASSURED THAT HELP IS GOING TO BE THERE. THAT WE REALLY NEED TO PARTNER TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DONE. PUBLISHED SUCCESS AND WE DON'T JUST RAISE UP HOPES IF WE CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE SO. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON THE MANAGED CARE PART OF IT AND WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN DOING. AND I GUESS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING. ON THIS NEW PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD. JUST WANT TO SPEAK ON THE SPECIFICALLY BEFORE WE MOVED TO OUR PANEL DR PAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE A PRESENTATION BY OUR MEDICAID DIRECTOR- J. C. COOPER- AND REALLY APPRECIATE IT- GOVERNORS- ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- SAYS- HER MEDICAID DIRECTOR- RAN THROUGH SOME OF THE STATISTICS ABOUT THE NEEDS AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTREPID PROPOSAL THE SCOPE THAT'S GONNA. TAKE SOME TIME AND STUDY TO DO IT RIGHT- THAT THE NEED IS IMMEDIATE AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THIS- CHALLENGE OF- OF- THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE AND EVEN AS WE ARE PLANNING FIGURING THIS OUT- THEY MAY BE DETERIORATING AND- IN TERMS OF THE- THE- UNCERTAIN TERMS OR STATUS AND SO- I THINK WE GOT THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE TO PEOPLE. IS EVEN AS WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THIS OUT BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO FELT THEY STAYED NINE. A STATEWIDE NETWORK- IT'S PRETTY CHEAP TO STRINGS THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW VARIOUS COUNTIES AND SO FORTH BUT- WE DO NEED I THINK A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE- I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT SCHOOLING SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE AGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF. YOUR SOURCE OF COVERAGE. BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE RIGHT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TO SERVE ALL OF ITS STUDENTS EQUALLY. BUT YET YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE ON MEDICARE WELL YOU HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED YOU HAVE STUDENTS ON A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BE SURE THOSE PARTICULAR- YEAH- DIFFERENCES DON'T END UP CAUSING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCESS IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND AT THE SAME TIME SETTING UP THE KIND OF RULES THAT ALLOW THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SUSTAINABLE HI SO I APPRECIATE THE- THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT BUT- IN THE END- THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND BEING SURE THAT THE US. THAT THE SERVICES CAN BE. EVENTUALLY GOT REIMBURSED. AS WELL- WHAT IS ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE PANEL- BUT CERTAINLY AS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. WON THE BIG BARRIERS TO ANY SORT OF GOT. SERVICES WE HAVE AS LONG. ACT AND CONVEY THAT THERE. WHO CAN SPEAK LANGUAGE HOW MUCH. WORK THEY CAN DO SO CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK- THE DIRECT COOPER- TO THE- COMMITMENT TO LANGUAGE ACCESS. WE HAVE CERTAINLY MANY STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS WHO ARE NOT PRIMARY ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE PRIMARY ENGLISH LANGUAGE. AND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT YOU TODAY ATTIC COMPONENT. FOR YOUR INVOLVING FAMILIES AS WELL AND- EVEN MORE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS PERHAPS AREN'T PRIMARY ENGLISH SPEAKER SO. HE SPEAK TO THE- THE COMMITMENT TO LANGUAGE ACCESS AND IN THIS PROPOSAL. YES I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THAT WOULD BE A CORE FOCUS OF MAKING SURE THAT IT IS- AS SENSITIVE TO THOSE ITEMS THAT WE ARE LINGUISTICALLY A PROVIDING SERVICES WITHIN SOMEONE'S LANGUAGE WHEN POSSIBLE- AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE THAT TO THE GROUP TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THAT TYPE OF ACCESS AND SERVICES. OKAY SO I THINK THAT AGAIN- I REALIZE THERE'S CHALLENGES THERE OFTENTIMES THE PROVIDER THEMSELVES THE MIDDLE OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE- YOU KNOW SPEAKING- MISSED THE ALL THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT WE NEED IN THE COVER BUT- WE COULD DEFINITELY TRYING TO BE SURE- I THINK. YOU KNOW. I HEAR A LOT OF IF POSSIBLE AND SO FORTH AND I REALIZED THERE- BUT- IT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO SOME VERY STRONG COMMITMENT TO- TO LANGUAGE ACCESS- OTHERWISE WE'LL LEAVE OUT. UNFORTUNATELY LARGE CHUNKS OF SIGHT CALIFORNIANS- AND- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID BUT- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE- PROPOSALS AND PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO HAVING A SURE LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO ALL THE STUDENTS TO THE STUDENTS WHO NEED THE SERVICES AND THAT BY THE WAY THAT ALSO BY WAY OF THE LAST OF THE STIGMA ISSUES WELL. SO- APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT PAN. OF MR EWING DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK AT ALL ABOUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE PANEL I'M SORRY THAT I. ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AT ALL. MY COMMENTS ARE LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE- PROPOSAL TO SUBMIT TO EXPAND UPON THE- STUDENT SERVICES ACT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT- MANY OF THE PRIORITIES ARE AREAS OF FOCUS THAT DIRECTOR COOPER LAID OUT IN THE- VERY BROAD PROPOSAL WHICH CLEARLY. KNOW NEEDS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PLANNING ARE VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING INTERNATIONALLY. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES RATHER THAN ASKING THOSE FAMILIES TO BE RESPONSIVE TO HOW WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM. AND THAT INCLUDES STARTING WITH THE PREMISE THAT WE NEED TO DELIVER CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED CARE AND SUPPORT AND WE SHOULD REALLY DESIGNED OUR SYSTEM. AND THEN HAVE FINDING SUPPORT THAT SYSTEM RATHER THAN HAVE OUR SYSTEM REFLECT FUNDING ON IT. SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT BROADER PROPOSAL AROUND THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT AND WHAT WE HOPE IS A STRONG COORDINATION AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROPOSAL TO ENGAGE MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT I WAS PLANNING TO DO THAT. ON OUR YOU KNOW MORE SPECIFICALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION THEN THE ANALYSIS ON THE NHS AND SAY. ISSUE OKAY. THANK YOU AND AGAIN WE CERTAINLY DO NOT DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THE NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN STATED NOPE NOBODY NOBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS MADE IT THROUGH. THIS PANDEMIC WITHOUT WITHOUT FEELING THE EFFECTS OF IT ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. AND I KNOW I HAVE A TWELVE YEAR AT HOME I KNOW DOCTOR PAN HAS YOUNG PEOPLE AT HOME I KNOW. I A A SINNER TROUBLE HAS HAS CHILDREN AS WELL SO WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS OUT. BUT THE LONG TERM UNDER INVESTMENT WE'VE HAD IN MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE PANEL NOW- IF NOBODY ELSE AND HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS AND I KNOW ONE OF OUR PANELISTS. HAS TO LEAVE EARLY- WHEN WE'VE GONE ON A LITTLE LONG HERE SO I BELIEVE IT IS DR ERICA. SIMON ISSUE THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FROM A STUDENT SERVICES IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED IS GOING TO SPEAK AND DOES HELP ME INTRODUCE EVERYBODY ELSE'S GONNA SPEAKING NO WE'RE GONNA START. WITH DOCTOR SIMON. WE HAVE A SEAN FRANCIS ALSO ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR HEALTH COLLABORATIONS FOR CHILDREN NOW WE HAVE. LEAH- GORDO FROM DIRECTOR OF THE SERVICE THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND LINNEA COOKMAN ACTING CEO OF THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA- AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVING A SERIES OF QUESTIONS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS. OF PROPOSALS. AND LET'S START WITH DR SIMON. SO GOOD EVENING OR GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON SKEWS ME. STERN AND MADAM CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE-MEMBERS IT IS A PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO BE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS JOINT HEARING MY NAME IS ERIN SIMON AND I SERVED AS THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE FOURTH LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA ALONE BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS THE STATE'S VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. ADMINISTRATORS HELLO MICHELLE BY SCHOOL DISTRICT BELIEVES AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO LINKING STUDENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHERE STUDENTS ARE. AT SCHOOL. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I CAN SAY THAT WE PLAYED A LEADING ROLE TO PLAY. AND THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. IT HAS BEEN STATED THAT OVER 70% OF STUDENTS RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUR SCHOOLS. WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER AS A CHEMICAL PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR ALL STUDENTS NO MATTER THEIR ZIP COLD. OR SOCIAL STATUS. COOL SITES ARE PRIME LOCATIONS TO CONDUCT SCREENINGS AND ASSESSMENTS PROVIDE TREATMENT LINKED TO SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY COORDINATE CASE MANAGEMENT FOR STUDENTS PROVIDE TEACHER TRAINING TO CREATE A POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL. AND PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION SERVICES AND I THINK YOU HEARD THAT WAS SOME OF THE REMARKS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER. TOP AMONG THE CHALLENGES. IS THE LACK OF RESOURCES THE LACK OF NON MEDICAL AGENCIES- EVEN THE LACK OF CASE MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS FOR AGENCIES THAT DO HAVE MEDICARE OUT. THE COMPOUND COMPETING AGENCIES BETWEEN COUNTY AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS AND WHICH ALSO PRESENTS A SET OF INEQUITIES FOR NON MEDICARE FAMILY. THAT'S IT ALTHOUGH ONE TIME FUNDING HAS BEEN USEFUL FOR DISTRICTS WE TRULY APPRECIATE IT THERE IS A NEED FOR LONG TERM FUNDING TO TACKLE LONG LASTING MENTAL HEALTH THE- SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED REGARDLESS OF. PAYER SO ALL CHILDREN CAN RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. THERE'S. ALSO A NEED FOR SYSTEMIC MINUTES WERE MAY HEALTH. FOR TEACHERS SCHOOL SITES THAT AND I'M AND I'M- BUT YOU KNOW. CARD IN IT SINCE LAST INTENSIVE STAN. BETTER BASED. AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE INCOME. MISS HEALTH AND SCHOOL HE ALSO. COMMUNITY SEE SCHOOLS AS A SENSE OF SUPPORT THEY FEEL MORE COMPETENT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL THE SHUTTERING OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS AMID COLD IT SEPARATE STUDENTS FROM MUCH MORE THAN JUST CLASSROOMS FRIENDS AND HOBBIES IT ALSO CUT ALL STUDENTS FROM CARING STAFF SERVICE MENTORS. LIFESAVERS AND HELP STUDENTS BUILD SELF ESTEEM AND COPE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND TRAUMA. CALL IT WE HAVE A LONG LASTING EFFECTS. PARENTS AND GUARDIANS. WE'VE ALWAYS PRIORITIZES THE STATE AS A NATION THE CORE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS RIGHT FOR CENTURIES. IT'S ALL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING MUST BE PRIORITIZED AS WELL. STUDENTS MUST MASTER BEFORE THEY BLOW GREAT OPPORTUNITY COMES WITH GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. I AM PREPARED AND HAPPY TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT. THE DISTRICT OF MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT OUR REFERRAL PROC PROCESS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COMMITTEE BEHAVIOR HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS OR ANY OTHER TOPIC THE COMMITTEE WISHES TO DISCUSS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I DON'T THINK I SAID ANYTHING THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS SAID. I'M ON THIS PANEL- BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT PROSPECTUS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY- IT'S BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS IN SPECIFIC AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK DID YOU SAY IT IS YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT PART OF A- I MEAN JUST AS A PARTNERSHIP. WE ARE NOT WE ARE PART OF A SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS WHERE WE HAVE SEVERAL SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS OR UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. THEY HELP US WITH COLLECTED HERE THREE INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR AT THIS POINT OKAY BUT LET US AND MOVE ON- WITH THE REST OF THE PANEL LET ME SEE. ATRIA TO GET GLASSES ON AND OFF TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WHAT SHOULD WE GO BACK UP AND- TO START FROM THE TOP ANGLE WITH A LINEAR KRUGMAN COOKED COOKED COOKED MAN'S- PUT THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BY NAME FOR THE ACTIVE AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA. SHE FEELS THE STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE SIXTEEN NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED MEDIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS. THAT SERVE OVER EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL. I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND WE DID A PROGRAM AS A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS AND INCREASE OUR PARTNERS THAT SHIP. WITH GOLD AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. I'LL BRIEFLY RESPOND TO THE FOUR QUESTIONS HE ASKED AND THEN HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY OTHERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. FIRST WITH RESPECT TO INCREASING ACCESS TO THE ORAL HEALTH SERVICES. LOCAL PLANTS BELIEVE OUR ROLE IS BOTH ABOUT PROMOTING AWARENESS AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO CARE. LOCAL PLANS IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE AWARE OF AVAILABLE SERVICES AND HOW TO ACCESS THEM. INCLUDING PUBLISHING MENTAL HEALTH FOCUSED MEMBER NEWSLETTERS. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. I THANK THE LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND DISTURBING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFORMATION THE SCHOOL DIRECTLY. NEED EFFORT HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN PENETRATION OF THE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT IN RECENT YEARS FOR BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN. SECOND HELLO PLANNED COORDINATE WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS TODAY. THIS DOES LOOK DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE PLAN AND THEIR COUNTY ISN'T COOL. THAT MANY PLANTS AND INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THEIR COUNTY. HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHICH IN SOME CASES AND CRITICAL. IN ADDITION SOME PLANS HAVE CONTRACTS WITH SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. ARE CONTRACTED PROVIDERS IN THEIR NETWORK THAT BILL FOR SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OR WHEN THE COUNTY HAS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SCHOOL FOR NATUREFOR ALL TO THE PLANT CONTRACTED. PROVIDERS FOR MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES. THIRD ARE RECOMMENDED CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. OVERALL WE APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF NEED I THINK THE THING RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE. WE DO BELIEVE THE PROGRAM WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT LEFT FOR ALL PARTNERS AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM LARGELY FOCUSED ON. HE AIN'T TRAINING THE COURT FOR SCHOOL COUNTY AND PLANNED. TO CONDUCT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS OR GAP ANALYSES AND THAT ALL THE PROJECT PLAN WITH SPECIFIC MILESTONES. HOWEVER WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME PROJECTS MAY BE READY TO GO SEE HER. AGAIN AND POSSIBILITY WILL BE KEY. THEY ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE CLEAR DIRECTION ON EXPECTATIONS FOR RECORDING MILESTONES AND METRICS. ADDITIONALLY GIVEN THAT THERE ARE OVER ONE THOUSAND LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. FURTHER DISCUSSION IS NEEDED REGARDING WHAT LEVEL OF COORDINATION- LOCALLY PARTICULARLY FOR PLANNING. PROCESS FEES AND LEARNING COLLABORATIVE. AND LASTLY L. TO BARRIERS TO CONTACTING THE SCHOOL. WE DO BELIEVE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS A VERY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN OUR SYSTEM'S. PLANET ENTERING INTO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SCHOOL. SCHOOL WOULD BECOME A NETWORK PROVIDER OF THE PLAN WHICH COMES TO SPECIFIC FEDERAL AND STATE% REQUIREMENTS. SUCH AS ENROLLMENT AND CREDENTIALING ENCOUNTER DATA SUBMISSION CLAIMS AND BILLING AND DATA SHARING. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING WHICH IS WHY THEY WILL NEED. TO BE SUBSTANTIAL PA AND TRAINING. WHERE THIS PROCESS WE ALSO CONTRACT TEMPLATE MODELS WOULD BE HELPFUL RESOURCE. HOWEVER I'LL MENTION THAT WE DON'T SEE DIRECT CONTRACTING IS THE ONLY OPTION OR BEST OPTION FOR EVERY SCHOOL. OTHER MODELS SUCH AS EMBEDDING NAVIGATORS OR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WITH AN ACTUAL ARE HAVING SCREENINGS AND REFERRALS AT SCHOOL SITES. ARE OTHER APPROACHES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. AND WHICH MEET THE GOAL OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH FOR STUDENTS. SO IN SOME WAYS THE PART OF THE AIMS OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THE IMPORTANT DETAILS. YES THE LEGISLATURE AND. OUR COUNTY IN FULL PARTNERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY ABOUT THE- TED MS CLARK. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY I SPOKE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION BECAUSE OVER HALF OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL CAN YOU BE HERE FOR A HEALTH AGENCIES HAVE PARTNERED OVER DECADES WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN FACT 85% OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE PROVIDING MEDIC MEDIC HOW MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES RIGHT NOW. WITH TWENTY COUNTIES COVERING BETWEEN EIGHTY AND 1100% OF SCHOOL CAMPUSES WITHIN THEIR COUNTIES WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP PROVIDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES THE MOST COMMON MODEL TO KEEP THE COUNTY HEALTH USES FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS USING A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SCHOOL STAFF FOCUSED ON PROVIDING EDUCATIONALLY RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR ARMS AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES OPERATE ON SCHOOL SITES AND PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THE E. P. S. D. T. PENDANT BENEFIT. SCHOOL STAFF REFER STUDENTS RECEIVING ARMS AS WELL AS STUDENTS THAT ARE MEETING ACADEMIC STANDARDS MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR- ARMS ONSITE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN ANOTHER COMMON MODEL. SCHOOLS CONTRACT WITH K. EVER AGENTS. TO PROVIDE ARMS SERVICE ON SITES THANK WE HAVE A HEALTHY. ALL PROVIDE P. PST T. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS ON THE SCHOOL SITE. ALTHOUGH IT'S A LESS COMMON MODEL COUNTY HERO HEALTH AGENCIES DO CONTRACT WITH SCHOOLS THAT SCHOOL STAFF. TO PROVIDE MEDICARE REIMBURSABLE SERVICES. INC AND THIS MODEL TYPICALLY WE CONTRACT WITH LICENSED SCHOOL STAFF AS MEDI CAL PROVIDERS OR WITH APPROPRIATELY TRAINED SCHOOL BASED STAFF. THAT PROVIDE ARMS OR AND OR PPS CREDENTIALED STAFF TO PROVIDE A LIMITED SET OF SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES APPROPRIATE FOR DELIVERY ON THE SCHOOL SITE- WHEN I MENTIONED SOME OF THE BARRIERS SCOPE OF PRACTICE IS ANOTHER ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WITH. PPS CREDENTIALED STAFF BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE STAFF MEMBERS ARE NOT LICENSED AND BECAUSE MEDIC HOW HAVE SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS. FOR NON LICENSE STATUS. COUNTIES BRADY FUNDING TO PROVIDE SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MOST UTILIZE MEDIC HAL AS FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES THAT PAY THE NON FEDERAL SHARE WITH BOTH AMATEUR STATE FUNDS AND REALIGNMENT FUNDING AND IT JUST SAY FUNDS ARE ALSO USED FOR NON MEDICARE REIMBURSABLE SERVICES. TO A SMALLER EXTENT SCHOOLS DO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SERVICES THE COUNTIES PROVIDE WITH A FOCUS ON NON MEDICAL REIMBURSABLE SERVICES USING EL CAP AND OTHER SCHOOL FUNDS. A FEW COUNT COUNTIES DO SUCCESSFULLY BILL PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR SOME REIMBURSEMENT. AS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS TO BE HT I STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT OF INCREASING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLSIN A MANNER THAT RECOGNIZES THE EXPENSIVE SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND AGENCIES AGENCY CONTRACTED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE'VE RECOMMENDED ADDING MORE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AS PART OF THE INCENTIVES AND INCENTIVES TIED. TO SERVING ALL pALLOWING FOR THAT. AS WELL AS ALLOWING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF WELLNESS CENTERS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ULTIMATELY WE BELIEVE A THREE WAY PARTNERSHIP BENEFITS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTICIPATION AND LEADERSHIP BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE ABILITY UNDER STATE LAW TO SERVE AND BE REIMBURSED. FOR CARE TO ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN NEED OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ADDITION AND MOST OF THE SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE. ALSO NON MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND MANY SCHOOLS THAT WE SERVE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SERVE ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THE CUTIE IF THE DIAGNOSIS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENTITY. IS FUNDS REMAIN AFTER CAL AIM PAYMENT REFORM HAS BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN ABOUTA YEAR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR WE'RE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING BECOMING DIRECT RECIPIENTS OF THESE FUNDS ASSUMING THAT COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL MATCH PORT. FOREST SIMILAR TYPE OF IT'S A SCHOOL BASED. INCENTIVE PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY- LET'S ON AND- TO- MISSILE WILL SHARE FRANCIS PLEASE PLAYER FRANCIS I'M SORRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LUSHAN FRANCIS AND I'M AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT CHILDREN NOW THANK YOU SHARE AD MANAGER LAYERED AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. THE BIG THING I'D LIKE TO DRIVE HOME FOR YOU ALL TODAY IS THE SAME ISSUE DR PAN RACE BRIEFLY AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF TIMING. IMAGINE THAT CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING ONE OF ITS MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. AND INSTEAD OF DEPLOYING FIRST RESPONDERS THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES A PLAN FOR HOW TO USE FIRST RESPONDERS FOR NEXT YEAR'S FIRES. BOB GOOD STATE GOVERNANCE INCLUDES PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE WE WOULD ALL AGREE IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE TO LET THE CURRENT FIRES BLAZE. THIS IS BEEN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. ISN'T URGENT NEED TO RESPOND TO THE CURRENT CRISIS BUT THE STATE IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS IN A YEAR OR TWO. DURING TWENTY TWENTY THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF THESE ARTICLES OUTLINING THE INCREASE IN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. RISING OVERDOSE DEATHS AND HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SUICIDES OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. URGENCY OF NEED IS EXACTLY WHY OUR COALITION IN SUPPORTING THE INCREASED INVESTMENT INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES WHO ALREADY HAVE A PLAN AROUND CRISIS INTERVENTION. ASSESSMENTS MEETING FOR BUT A HEALTH NEEDS TREATMENT AND LINKAGES TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO BE FUNDED. DEPENDING ON COUNTY CAPACITY TO RESPOND B. L. A. C. CAMP ROSTERS NEW FUNDING AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS WITH THE SCHOOLS QUICKLY. AN INVESTMENT OF EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION WILL ALLOW COUNTIES LIKE MONTEREY SACRAMENTO RIVERSIDE CINEMA AND SAMPOERNA DINO TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OVER A MILLION STUDENTS AND- IN MULTIPLE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE COULD DO VERY QUICKLY IS TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND SUPPORTING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN WAYS THAT MAY BE HARD FOR SCHOOLS TO DO. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AMPLIFY WOULD DIRECTOR COOPER JUST SAID AND YOUNG PRINCE OF GIVING BACK ALORS DIRECTLY TO CEOS. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS WE BELIEVE THAT THE INFLUX OF DOLLARS THE STATE IS EXPERIENCING SHOULD GO TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE USED LET IT YOU. HOWARD AND SUPPORTING FAMILY. HIS ORGANIZATIONS ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO NOT ONLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ADVERSITIES EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN LIKE COMMUNITY BACK VIOLENCE OR ALSO PROVIDING IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO DO HAVE EXPERIENCES THAT SEVERELY IMPACT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH TODAY AS YOU EXAMINE THE PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU INCLUDING THE UPCOMING MAY REVISION I LIKE MEMBERS TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT WHA IS BEING FUNDED THAT WOULD HELP YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY AND WHAT IS BEING FUNDED THAT WOULD HELP CHILDREN IN A FEW YEARS. TO BE CLEAR CHILDREN NOW BELIEVES A LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND WE'RE SUPPORTING MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THE XPS SCRIBE TODAY. HEY YOU'RE A GNOSTIC INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR A WHILE. I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE PROPOSAL TOMORROW THAT DEREK- MENTION. OUR ONLY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE IN A UNIQUE MOMENT OF TIME IN NEED IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS AND TO SPEED UP MENTAL HEALTH AS- IF IT IS AN- ACTUAL EMERGENCY. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO BOTH. AS WE EXAMINE MAY REVISE CLOSELY AND OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION WE URGE MEMBERS TO NOT ONLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN PLAN FOR. A MORE ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CURRENT FIRE IT HAS YET TO BE EXTINGUISHED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY. TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE MOMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS. I THINK. MY FIRST QUESTION- IS I THINK YOU MISSED. YOUR BUT MAYBE ANYBODY ELSE TELL ME ABOUT YOUR WORK FORCE ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HIRE A LOT MORE AND TO. PROVIDE A LOT MORE RESOURCES. BUT WE KNOW WE ALSO NEED TO REFER- TO. INVEST IN OUR WORK FORCE THE ISSUE THE DOCTOR CAN RAISE ISSUES AROUND. THEM ED LANGUAGE ACCESS ACT ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR WORK FORCE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BUILD THAT UP CAN YOU HIRE RIGHT NOW ARE YOU. HAVE A LOT OF VACANCIES RIGHT NOW. I WOULD SAY THAT WORKFORCE IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE AND THAT'S WHY WE DID- DISCUSS WITH WITH YOU IT'S YES AND THEY WERE VERY RESPONSIVE. TO INCLUDING MORE ON THE WORK FORCE HE'S IN THIS PROPOSAL WORK FORCE TRAINING WORKFORCE INVESTMENT. I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE PROVIDED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. TO INVEST IN OUR WORK FORSTER STIPENDS LOAN REPAYMENT AND- OTHER OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE BEING RUN THROUGH. THAT MONEY IS ABOUT TO GO OUT SO WE ARE HOPING THAT THAT SUPPORTS- SOME OF THIS DEVELOPMENT. CURRENTLY WE USE. A DIFFERENT MIXTURE OF BOTH CURRENT CLINICAL STAFF AS WELL AS WELL I'M WELL TRAINED. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCESS CHILDREN WE ALSO USE PEERS WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. THE ABILITY TO POTENTIALLY USE MORE PEERS AND- ONCE ONCE. CERTIFICATION IS LIFTED UP IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE ABLE TO BILL MEDICARE AL FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDED BY PEERS. I'M THE ONE AREA THAT I WOULD MENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION IS. ON FEDERAL LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT HERE'S TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE. A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT SO YOU'VE PEERS WHICH IS A VERY STRONG MODEL IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SUPPORTED UNDER THE MEDICAL SYSTEM BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THAT WORKFORCE SO- CENTER ADMIN I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS LOTS OF NEEDS AROUND THEIR OWN WORKFORCE RICK CITED TO SEE. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WITH THE NEW FUNDING BUT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR THE PUBLIC. BEHAVIOR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WE ARE DOING A GAP ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW. WITH UCSF HEALTH FOR CENTER THAT WE AREN'T WHERE WE ARE IDENTIFYING THE BIGGEST GAPS IN OUR WORK FORCE. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT ONE OF THOSE BIG GAPS IS. IS THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN BY MANY OF OUR CONDITIONS- THAT IS THAT IS A VERY HERE WE DO USE OBVIOUSLY WITH. ALL THE MEDIC HELPER. WE USE TRY. AND A TRIP. SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT WE MEET WE MEET. THE LANGUAGE ACCESS NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION BUT- THE PIPELINE. IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT IN TERMS OF THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE FASTLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THE HUGE MAYBE MR- EWING CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER I KNOW. EARLY ON WITH THE- WITH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH MONEY WE I DID WE DID A SPECIALTY CLASS WITH THAT WITH API STUDENTS- TO BE ABLE TO REALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WITH LANGUAGE DIVERSITY GOING OUT INTO THE FIELD SO. I WOULD GUESS SOME MORE PROGRAMS THAT REALLY FOCUS ON SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES- LANGUAGE ACCESS WILL NEED TO BE FUNDED AS WE GO FORWARD IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH CLINICIANS THAT ARE THAT ARE LANGUAGE AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE- PROCESS SOMETHING ELSE ON MY MIND JUST WENT. BLANK ON ME SO I WILL SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME DR PAM. THANK YOU AND AT FIRST- JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE WORK FORCE ISSUE- THE PIPELINE OR ANY HEALTH PROFESSIONS ACTUALLY RATHER LONG SO I'D- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. PEOPLE'S DESIRE TO BUILD OUT THE PIPELINE BUT- BUT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE MORE IMMEDIATE WORKFORCE ISSUES ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE- HEY WORKING CONDITIONS- ACCESS TO CHILD CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS LIKE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE OUT THERE- WE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ENGAGE THEM. ARE THEY REMAKING A TRACTOR FOR THEM TO COME TO WORK R. TWO YOU KNOW IT'S BETTER- ARE WE ABLE TO RECRUIT OTHER PLACES BECAUSE WE'RE IF WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR TRAINING PIPELINE WE'RE TALKING OF THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW YEARS AND YEARS LATER. MAR DEL FIVE FIVE PLUS YEARS LATER SO THAT IS THERE BEEN SOME ASSESSMENT OF- MAYBE LOOKING AT LICENSING DATA AND SO FORTH AS TO HOW MANY. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HAVE OUT THERE AND DO WHAT DEGREE OR SOME OF THEM PERHAPS NOT ACTUALLY ACTIVELY IN PRACTICE AND THE REASONS WHY A- HARDER GOING RETIREMENT SITS AT OUR- SO- IS THIS. IS THERE ANY SORT OF ASSESSMENT THAT NATURE BEING DONE. SO I'M A TRIDENT. TO SOME OF THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING. AN ASSESSMENT AND A GAP ANALYSIS THAT DOES INCLUDE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS WHAT WE ARE FINDING IS ACTUALLY IN THE PUBLIC. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM WE DO HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LANGUAGE SKILLS AND- ETHNIC RACE AND ETHNIC. DIVERSITY THAN THE THAN THE ACTUAL PIPELINE SO THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO TEND TO COME TO OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. PART OF THE PROJECT THAT WE ARE DOING IS RUNNING FOCUS GROUPS OF WITH OUR ACTUAL CONDITIONS TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT RETENTION AND WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO- MAKING SURE THAT THEY STAY WITHIN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO WE ARE LOOKING TO THOSE ANSWERS UNFORTUNATELY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM TO YOU NOW WE ENGAGED IN A YEARLONG PROCESS WITH UCS AFTER TO TRY TO QUANTIFY SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. OKAY AND PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW- WHO AT THE STAKES I KNOW I SPOT PERHAPS ISN'T ON THE CALL BUT- KIND OF MEDICAL OR IN THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND HIS- HAS THERE BEEN A- MORE GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF. THE WORK FORCE IN A WAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE ABLE TO BETTER ABLE TO MOBILIZE OUR- OUR ALL OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ALL NOW RIGHT NOW WORKING FULL TIME COMPLETE AND I REALIZE PEOPLE HAVE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES THEY MAKE TO SELL. IN TERMS OF THEIR CAREERS- BUT- YEAH WE'LL SEE IF THAT WE WAIT FOR THE PIPELINE IT'S GOING TO BE HERE SO WHAT WHAT CAN WE MOBILIZE MORE IMMEDIATELY. FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AS A RANSOM ASSESSMENT OF THATDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE FAKE. THE- RETIRING MAYBE NEAR RETIREMENT MIGHT COME BACK- WORKING PART TIME MAYBE GIVEN THE STEP UP HOURS. SORRY SENATOR PAD WE WOULD ADD THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WOULD NEED TO DEPEND ON THE HOSPITAL PROBABLY ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THEY NEED A LOT OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE EFFORTS IN THE STATE AND SO. I WOULD NEED TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET YOUR RESPONSE FROM FROM THE STATE ALL RIGHT SO IT'S A TIGHT SO AGAIN WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE I KEEP HEARING ABOUT PIPELINE AND BELIEVE ME I BELIEVE IN PIPELINE BUT- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOW THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- YOU KNOW ACTUALLY I WAS AT THE VILLAGE B. DO A- INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH INNOVATIONS- THAT WAS SPONSORED BY STEINBERG INSTITUTE SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO STAND UP. RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW DO YOU WANT SOME TIME TO WORK ON THINGS AND I DO WANT TO JUST REINFORCE WHAT- THEY'LL CHILDREN NOW SAID WE HAVE WE HAVE AN EXISTING FIRE AS AS WELL SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN LOOK AT. WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT SOME OF THE KIDS NOW WHAT WE HAVE FOR THAT DAY WE LIKE TO SAY SHOVEL READY WE TALK OF INFRASTRUCTURE SO THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MIGHT BE SHOVEL READY- EXAM ROOM READY-OR WHATEVER BUT- IN ADDITION TO THAT- ARE THERE SOME COMPONENTS THAT PERHAPS WE CAN STAND UP MORE QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THINGS. LIKE- ECON SOLD- EIGHT- YOU KNOW I. OUT OF THE TO TALK. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. FOR SCHOOL STAFF BUT- EVEN LET'S SAY ON THE ECON SOLD SIR. IS IT POSSIBLE TO. SEE THINK ABOUT HOW QUICKLY WE CAN STAND UP THERE. AND HE CALLED. THE PROVIDING BASICALLY- MENTAL HEALTH DIRECT CONSULTATION TO BUILD SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THESE MODELS ARE OUT THERE- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON TELEHEALTH- THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. PANDEMIC DO YOU THINK THE THOSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME OPPONENTS WHO CAN STAND UP MORE QUICKLY- THAT- SO I. APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF LIKE SITTING BACK AND FIGURE OUT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM AT CETERA BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOME COMPONENTS THAT WE KNOW THE PART OF SYSTEM WE CAN STAND UP MORE QUICKLY- TO TRY TO. PROVIDE. MORE ACCESS TO SERVICES MORE IMMEDIATELY. WHAT WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IT'S GOING TO DEPEND WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS AND HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO A STATEWIDE. THE CONSOLE PLATFORM YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A PROCUREMENT- A COMPETITIVE CAN PROBE HIM AT PROCUREMENT FOR THE SERVICES. AND THEN LINKING TO A STATEWIDE NETWORK THOSE THINGS TYPICALLY DON'T HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY- IT WE DO NEED TIME TO KIND OF. CONSULT WITH PEOPLE AND DO THE ANALYTICS TO THE PROCUREMENT AND- I GET I GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT DESERVE MORE DYNAMIC WAY OF THINKING ABOUT SO I GET THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE- NOW. AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT OF THAT BUT AS WE'RE BUILDING UP TO THAT STATE WIDE NETWORK IS THERE A WAY TO START RECRUITING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE ECON SOLD. USING EXISTING PLATFORMS MORE IMMEDIATELY AND THEN ROLL THEM UP INTO A STATEWIDE YOU KNOW I. T. PLATFORMS WITH BUILT. SEVENTY THAT DOES REQUIRE PROCUREMENT AND SO FORTH. BUT THINKING ABOUT HOW WE BUILD SOME OF THIS STUFF A LITTLE BIT PARALLEL RAKES SO WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW. USING SOME. CERTAIN PLACES SOME REASON. SOME EXISTING PLATFORMS ETCETERA SAID WE'VE BEEN BUILDING OUT SOME TELEHEALTH STUFF SO FAR MAYBE THERE'S- SO IT JUST WANTED TO. THINK A LITTLE MORE CREATIVELY IN TERMS OF. HOW DO WE TRY TO. GET SERVICES TO PEOPLE MORE QUICKLY AND ACTUALLY EVEN AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS. WE'RE GOING TO SERVE THESE ARE ALMOST LIKE PILOTY TYPE THINGS BECAUSE MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING THAT MAY BE USEFUL AS WE BUILD OUT THE LARGER STATEWIDE SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT AND- ON A SMALLER SCALE PERHAPS BUT- USING EXISTING PLATFORMS. YES SO I THINK- IT'S GOING TO BE- SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE PIECES BUT THEN THE PROPOSAL DO YOU START- EARLIER RIGHT. A LOT OF THE WORK FORCE INFRASTRUCTURE STARTS BEFORE THAT. VIRTUAL PLATFORM HAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WOULD LAUNCH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE. MARKET YOU KNOW. MOVING FORWARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ON THE- INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SCHOOLING TO GRANTS WOULD GO UP EARLIER- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND- CONNECTING THE PLANS TO THE SCHOOLS. WOULD BE YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE TO LAUNCHING KIND OF THE STATE WIDE NETWORKS OF THOSE PIECES WOULD BE HAPPENING PRIOR TO YOU. AS WELL AS- EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE GRANTS SO IDENTIFYING WHICH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES WE WANT TO- YOU KNOW SPREAD AND EXPAND STATEWIDE WOULD BE ABLE TO. FOLLOW THOSE DOLLARS IN ADVANCE TO THAT KIND OF STATE OR STATEWIDE PLATFORM. AND THEN. IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THAT THEY HAVE A WHOLE CONTINUUM. WHERE WE'RE NEEDING THE ACTUAL. BRICK AND MORTAR PIECES THOSE WOULD BE STARTING IN ADVANCE OF A LOT OF BLIND. SHE ARE GOING TO. PRIOR TO THE START. THAT FOUNDATION THAT BASE. GETTING THE INVESTMENT OUT STATEWIDE. TO EVENTUALLY THEN TAP INTO THAT INTO THE VIRTUAL PLATFORMS OF WHERE THOSE DIRECT SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED THE LINKS AND THE- CONNECTIONS TO. THOSE REFERRALS BUT WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT FEEDBACK BACK IN REGARDS TO YOU. EVEN SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW YOU CONSUL IN OTHER PIECES HOW CAN MEAN BABY. LEVERAGE THAT AND GET THEM UP SOONER SO WE CAN WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK AND HAVE SOME. ANTIQUE ABOUT THAT. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN ALSO YOU TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN I ASSUME THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN EARLIER THAN LATER- BECAUSE- IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE STIGMA ISSUES ANY OTHER ISSUES. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. AND THEN AND THEN I THINK I THINK AND JUST WANT TO REINFORCE SOMETHING THAT- CHAIR EDMUND SAID IS THAT- CERTAINLY VERY EXCITED. ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT ALSO BE SURE WE- TAYLOR EXPECTATIONS IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T SEE- SET EXPECTATIONS WHERE PEOPLE BECOME DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO COME BACK IF THEY FEEL DISAPPOINTED UP IN THE BEGINNING SO I'M NOT. WE WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S HELP WE NEED TO BE SURE WE CAN MEET THAT NEED AND- WHEN WAS WE AS AS WE'RE DOING THIS BUT WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY SOTHAT- WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE. ARE GETTING FRUSTRATED AND THEN WALKING AWAY AND THEN WE WONDER WHY DON'T SHOW UP LATER WHEN WE ARE READY- SO WE HAVE THAT THAT'S GONNA BE CAREFUL PART OF THAT THE- THE MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS AS WELL. TO BE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET HELP. BUT AT THE LEVEL WHICH WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE IT- AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO HELP MAYBE ONE TO HELP THE MORE- BUT JUST JUST BE SURE TO BRING THAT AND THEN AGAIN I JUST WANT REINFORCE WHAT CHILDREN NOW SAID WE DO HAVE SOME I SAID THAT PERHAPS EXAM ROOM READY THINGS THAT WE- MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. BE SURE WE CAN ROLL OUT SO THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING PEOPLE ON HOLD AS WELL SO IT'S KIND OF THE BALANCE OF EXPECTATION AND SERVICE. THANK YOU. THE YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN. YEAH AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE'RE MOVING INTO THE SUMMERTIME ON SCHOOLS GET READY TO GET OUT- SOME SOME HAVEN'T START ALL THE WAY YET AND SO AS WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I WOULD JUST. ECHO THE URGENCY OF SENATOR PAN IN. MAKING SURE WE HAVE WHATEVER WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN PUT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW FOR SUMMER MONTHS- WHETHER THAT'S A TWO ONE ONE SYSTEM THE COUNTIES ARE USING IN SOME PLACES OR- I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE COULD. USE A MY TURN FOR SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT TOO BUT ANYWAY. THE FASTER ACCESS WE CAN GET AND MAKE SURE THERE'S HELP OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE AS WE GO INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS. THIS IMPORTANT. QUESTION FOR MANY OTHER SENATORS AT AT THIS TIME. THE MANAGER MIGHT RESPOND TO SENATOR PAM THIS IS TOBY DOING. THIS GUEST MISTREATMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TOOK EVEN WITH MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION. I WANTED TO- MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE- ON THE WORK FORCE ISSUE IN CALL AND RESPONSE TO STATE IT'S PHENOMENAL WORK TO ACTIVATE THE ENTIRE WORK FORCE THAT WAS AVAILABLE LAST SENATOR PAN SAID. AND WE DID HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACTIVATING THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. IN SOME EMERGENCY TYPE STATUS YET IN A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO WHAT WAS DONE WITH NURSES RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS- I DO WANT TO REFERENCE THAT. AS WAS BENCHED BY CHILDREN NOW- COUNTIES ACTUALLY ARE READY TO GO WITH IF THERE'S- ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT. AND NEARLY EAT NEARLY ALL OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDER FUNDED. HAVE PROPOSED USING A PORTION OF THOSE FUNDS. TO DO MENTAL HEALTH SCREENS FOR STUDENTS AND THIS COULD BE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. ABOUT HOW TO BUILD OUT AND SCALE SCREENING IN A WAY THAT COULD FEED INTO THE BROADER PLAN TO GET MINISTRATION HAS IN MIND. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT THE CAL HOPE WEBSITE. DOES HAVE A COMPONENT OF DIGITAL TOOLS. FOR CALIFORNIANS ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IT'S A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT THAT THE COMMISSION MADE CONSISTENT WITH SOME FUNDING FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION. AND FEMA FUNDS. IT'S SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS THE WARM. HERE SUPPORT AFTER. THE SOCIAL. LEARNING INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO THE FEMA GRANT THAT COULD BE BUILT UPON SOME OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S. JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THAT SENATOR SENATOR PAM SAYS WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME THINGS IN PLACE OVER THE SUMMER. THAT WOULD ALLOW THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND THESE EFFORTS TO. BE THERE WHEN STUDENTS WALK BACK ON CAMPUS. EDITION ONLY THEY ALSO COULD PROVIDE AID THE RIGHT KIND OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME OUT. WHAT THE BROADER PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IS DISCUSSING WHAT LOOK LIKE OVERTIME. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER EWING OKAY AND I THINK YOU JILL TO STAY ON BECAUSE- ON OUR LAST ISSUE- THE ISSUE FOUR SIX. FOUR FIVE SIX ZERO ISSUE NUMBER ONE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. ABSOLUTELY SO THAT THERE ARE TWO ISSUES IN THE TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS AN EXTENDED TIME FRAME TO. ALLOW CAN'T SOME OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO CONTINUE TO USE FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION AND THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED COUNTIES HAVE FACED A NUMBER OF BARRIERS AS HAVE WE ALL HERE AND BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO NEEDS AND SO THE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. IN ESSENCE ARE TO ALLOW A LONGER TIME FRAME FOR COUNTIES TO UTILIZE SOME OF THEIR SPD TO FINES. AND TO SUPPORT A MULTI COUNTY INNOVATION COLLABORATIVE THAT IS DESIGNED TO EXPLORE THE USE OF PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES AS A STRATEGY TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON CRISIS SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT AND STATE HOSPITAL INVOLVEMENT. THROUGH BETTER UPSTREAM ENGAGEMENT WITH PEERS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF NEEDING CRISIS SERVICES SO THOSE TO TACKLE JUST SPENDS ARE TO ALLOW THAT WORK TO CONTINUE. OKAY DENISON DOES MAKE SENSE WE THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AT THIS AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND WE WILL BE HOLDING ALL OF THESE ITEMS OPENER ALL INFORMATIONAL ITEMS AND WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATIONS- AT THIS TIME WE WILL MOVE ON IF NO MEMBERS HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO THIS. WE WILL MOVE ON TO- ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS THERE MIGHT BE. I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE ANYBODY IN ROME TWENTY FORTY ONE BUT WE CAN LOOK OVER THERE TWENTY FORTY. YUP THERE WE GO. OKAY A MODERATOR ARE YOU THERE. I AM HERE THANKS VERY MUCH HE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO MAC COMMAND AGAIN. ONE ZERO. THANK YOU LET US KNOW HOW MANY ARE IN THE QUEUE MYSTERON RAIDER. RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE TEN PEOPLE IN QUEUE. AND ARE FIRST COMMENT COMES FROM THE LINE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN LOVE THANK YOU MATT. I THANK THE MEMBERS WERE HAVING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS BEGINNING COLBERN I'M THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION AND I'M- PROVIDING COMMENTS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE CHILD CARE. OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS RECORDED THANKS ALL AND OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES WITH ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND OTHER FAMILIES THE COURT. STARTED THE PANDEMIC ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS WERE IMMEDIATELY TASKED WITH GETTING MONEY OUT FOR PPP AND TYPE IN FOR PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE LONELINESS AND SHOW WORKERS. IT'S BEEN ROLLING AND THEN RE ENROLLING OR CONTINUING. AGENCY STEPPED UP TO IMPLEMENT THE PANDEMIC RELATED MANDATES WITHOUT MEANINGFUL FUNDING AT FIVE MACAU WORKS PROGRAM THE CURRENT NUMBER OF VOUCHERS WITH ROUGHLY SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE SENATE PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDCARE SLOTS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO BE ABOUT VOUCHERS. OUR COMMUNITY EIGHTIES MUST BE FUNDED WITH MONEY TO GET THE FAMILY CONTROLLED AS THE CURRENT FUNDING MODEL OF A PIECE IS ONLY BASED ON MONIES THAT GO OUT THE DOOR TO A PROVIDER. ONE CHOSEN BY A FAMILY THIS FUNDING MODEL DOES NOT ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BEGIN TO RAMP UP. TO MEET THE ANTICIPATED AND NEEDED A ROMAN FAMILY AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE ROUGHLY ONE THIRD OF THE FAMILIES THAT BEGIN THE CHILD CARE ENROLLMENT PROCESS DO NOT COMPLETE. UTILIZATION OF ONE TIME MONIES ALLOCATED TO AGENCIES TO BEGIN HIRING AND TRAINING CASE MANAGER AND ENROLLMENT SPECIALISTS WOULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT. I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED THAT THE T. K. PROPOSAL DOES JEOPARDIZE THE PARENTAL CHOICE THE CHILD CARE. FOR THEIR CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT THERE BE NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE DURING SCHOOL HOURS. ASIDE FROM THE ABOVE WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR SUPPORT- WITH ISSUES RAISED BY THE ECB COALITION AND LIFT UP THE REIMBURSEMENT ABOUT THAT OF OUR VALUES FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE.

I WORKFORCE WE ARE CONCERNED WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED WE HAVE TWO MILLION CHILDREN ARE QUALIFIED OR NOT. AND WE WERE EXCITED IS THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I COULD BE A LONG TERM PLAN TO GETTING YOUR CHILDREN IN. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND THE G. CAPABLE AS IT. OPENED THE REST TO CHILD CARE IF WE ARE TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD REALLY URGE CONSIDERATION. AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT OUR RATES ARE STABILIZED BUT THE CHILD- ZERO THREE ARE ALSO PRIORITIZED.

I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP LEVEL AND THE MARGIN LEVEL I REPRESENT ANY AIRPORT- AND THEN ON THE P. OR I'D MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE INVESTMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS CALL CARE WHOLE PERSON CARE ANTICIPATING THAT- WE OPERATE HIGHLY THAT WE HAVE A REAL CRISIS IN THE COMING OF OUR SCHOOLS. AND CHILDREN ARE IN THIRTY FOUR THEY ARE A GREATER RISK FOR. BOTH POLITICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SO WE WOULD URGE AN INVESTMENT IN THE QATARI- STAFF HAD TO CLIMB IN.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR CALL NEXT CALLER PLEASE. POLITE AT. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE. HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTINA HACKED AND I WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE WHERE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ISSUES AND DRINKING WATER SAFETY ACCESS AND EDUCATION TWENTY FOURTEEN. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUDGET FOR ACCESS TO STATE AND APPEALING DRINKING WATER FOR CHILDREN IN CHILDCARE AND IN SCHOOL. WE HAVE A DUAL PANDEMIC BOTH COVERT AND PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF DIET RELATED DISEASES SUCH AS TYPE TWO DIABETES OBESITY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. EITHER INTER RELATED BECAUSE THE TOP CHRONIC CONDITIONS ARE ALSO RISK FACTORS FOR SEVERE COLD CASES SHOULD CONDITION COST OUR STATE MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTH CARE ANNUALLY. I TALKED TO TRY TO G. TO OVERCOME THESE IS BY REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION OF ADDED SUGARS. THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS IN THE DIET IS SUGARY DRINKS. WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO BANNED SUGARY DRINK SALES THEY THOUGHT MARKET. IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH INDICATORS. BUT IF WE WANT FOLKS TO DROPSHIP DRINKS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS DRINKING WATER THAT IS BOTH SAFE AND APPEALING WHICH IS IN LINE WITH OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO WATER AT THE HUMAN RIGHT. SO WHAT'S MAKE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAS AT LEAST ONE WATER BOTTLE FILLING STATION. CDPH ESTIMATES AT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER INSTALLATION MANY SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY THERE WE SHOULD GET THE REST OF THEM TO THAT. SAME LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. THAT WAY KIDS CAN GET MORE THAN THAT. THANK GOD IT WITHOUT SPREADING DISEASE. CHILDCARE PLEASE ADD TO THE BUDGET FOR LEAD MITIGATION AND CLIMBING TO MAKE OUR NEW BLOOD TESTING PROGRAM UNDER A B. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY THE FACT.
