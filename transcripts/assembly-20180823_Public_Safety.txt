IN OPPOSITION OR YOUR HUNDRED SUPPORT VALLEY NOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IN THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT BETTER. IN OTHER MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION. OKAY QUESTIONS. FOR ANYBODY ON THE PANEL HERE. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH SUCH A GOOD BILL? EVERYONE COOPERATED ON THIS. ONE OKAY I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FIRST OF ALL CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE SUNSET DATES THAT ARE THROUGHOUT THIS BILL THERE'S SOME INTERESTING. SHORT PERIODS OF TIME TWO YEARS IS PRETTY SHORT. WHAT WE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF ANYTHING ELSE GOES ON ANY OF THE LEGISLATION -- WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE HOW THIS BILL WORKS -- WE'VE KIND OF ABDICATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY OVER. IT'S WHAT WE WERE SECURE MEMBERS AND WE WOULD GO BACK AND ACTUALLY. LOOK AT HOW A LAW ACTUALLY IMPACTED COMMUNITY A WE FELT TWO YEARS WAS WHICH WAS MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME. OF TO MAKE THAT EVALUATION AND MORE IMPORTANT IF WE HAD TO DO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. IT DIDN'T FORCES US TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND AND IN TWO YEARS BOB ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT IS THERE'S IS VERY VERY SERIOUS CRIME INNOCENT AFFECTING ALLEN TO BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- CERTIFICATE LA LIVES AND SO ARE WE SHOULD LET LANGUAGE FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE COMING BACK -- AND REALLY KIND OF FORCING US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT THIS AGAIN SOONER THAN LATER. I THINK YOU YOU KNOW I'M COMMITTED TO THAT I AYE PRESENTED BILLS VERY SIMILAR THAT GOT. REJECTED IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE AND SO I MIGHT AS A JUST A VERY VERY INTERESTING THAT AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET SOME CLARIFYING. ANSWERS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL -- STUDY COMES OUT AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATE. HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT. THE STUDY COMES OUT AFTER SO DID. I AM HOPING THAT WE GET PRELIMINARY INFORMATION ON THE STUDY. FROM THE STUDY -- BEFORE TO FINALIZE SO WE'VE WE DO HAVE TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN'T. SO RIGHT DOES COME OUT AFTER A BUT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE PRETTY GOOD INFORMATION BEFORE THAT. KILL MY IT WHY NOT. ACTUALLY MY FINAL QUESTION HAS TO BE. WITH THE FACT THAT ON THE THIRD OFFENSE. WHEN SOMEBODY HAS A A THEFT? THEY'RE OFFERED DIVERSION ON THE THIRD. OFFENSIVE SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD. THE PENALTY SHOULD ESCALATE NOT DIMINISH. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. SO -- AND I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ON ON ON THE CRIME AMIGA WITH THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH BAIL FOR EXAMPLE -- WE'RE PUTTING PRE TRIAL -- RISK ASSESSMENT AND SO THIS GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO JUST SPECIFICALLY GO. WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE YOU YOU GIVE PEOPLE SPECIAL PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DRUGS. ALCOHOL PRIME AND DETONATE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFTER INTO RETAIL THEFT AND YOU'RE STEALING BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DRUG OR ALCOHOL PROBLEM. WE GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO GET TO PRE SUB COMPETITORS IN PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP THEM WITH% ALCOHOLISM AS YOU KNOW PROBABLY BETTER THAN I DO -- SOMETIMES FOR TO TAKE DOESN'T TAKE ONE OR TWO TIMES. CONTACT UNFORTUNATELY TAKE SEVEN TIMES. INFO DISK ALLOWS THAT. TO BE -- PART OF THE OUR OUR PART OF THAT BUT THE THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT JUST DALY JAILING PEOPLE -- INDISCRIMINATELY GOOD WHEN WE CAN PROVIDE HIM SOME SOME SERVICES. THAT'S STRATEGIES KINDA CONFUSED WE HAVE IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE AT THE VERY FIRST OFFENSE INSTEAD OF THE THIRD OF FAT JOE BILL BE SOME. I BELIEVE IT WILL BE SOME SOME OF DIVERSION PROGRAM SHUT AS YOU KNOW I PUT THIRTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS. FOR USE WITH ME CAN YOU PUT HIM DIVERSION PROGRAMS. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- DANVILLE'S HAVE THE LA DA'S OFFICE. DIVERSION WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE OR DID. ELECTORATE THROUGH AN INITIATIVE -- A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY. CAN ALWAYS ESTABLISH A DIVERSION PROGRAM UNLESS IT'S STATUTORILY PROHIBITED [inaudible] SO. DIVERSION IS AN OPTION. OF IS WAY IT I UNDERSTOOD UP THROUGH THE THIRD OFFENSE OF POLICY IT WOULD BE AT LEAST LA COUNTY -- OUTSIDE SOMEHOW NARCOTIC OR ALCOHOL ISSUE. OF YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET AT DIVERSION ON A THIRD CASE THAT CORKED OR THE DA. ABOUT WHAT UP WOULD OBJECT TO IT IF IT WAS JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON WAS CAUGHT FOR THE THIRD TIME -- THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF UNDERLYING ISSUE WHERE DIVERSION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF DURING VERSION IT EXCUSE ME IF DIVERSION ISN'T APPROPRIATE THAT. FELIX I DON'T SPEAK FOR LA COUNTY. BUT WE WOULD OBJECT. IT'S MONTH SAY THE DIVERSION IS AWFUL DOESN'T MANDATE THAT DIVERSION -- BE HERE. FOR GRANTED OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.
