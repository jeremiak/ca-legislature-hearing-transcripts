CAUCUS ALONG WITH OUR GREAT VICE

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:41.806
CHAIR DR PAN.

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.274
OUR API CAUCUS WITH THE

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:44.809
INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY OF API

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:46.544
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:49.480
ARE KEENLY KEENLY KEENLY FOCUSED

00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:51.516
ON ENSURING THAT WE GET IT RIGHT

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.584
AND THAT WE CAN EVERYONE --

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.152
BUT CERTAINLY TEN YEARS AGO WITH

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.753
THE TWO THOUSAND TEN CENSUS WHEN

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.288
I WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.990
FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:02.727
IN OUR CITY WE INVESTED HEAVILY

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:03.628
ENSURING THAT EVERYONE WAS

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.996
COUNTED AND WORK CLOSELY WITH

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:07.632
CEOS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.400
AND BECAUSE OF THE PROACTIVE

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.502
INVESTMENT WE MADE WE WERE ONE

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:13.504
OF THE FEW CITIES IN THE STATE

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.240
THAT DID NOT SEE ARE HARD TO

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:16.774
COUNT POPULATION NUMBERS GO DOWN.

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:18.476
AND THIS IS WHY ALONG WITH I

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:19.777
THINK EVERYONE ON THIS PANEL --

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:20.878
WERE ALL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:21.846
ENSURING THAT WE GET THE

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:23.815
RESOURCES TO THE RIGHT PLACES TO

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.116
MOVE THAT FORWARD.

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:25.683
AND THEN I WOULD SAY WITH

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.552
REGARDS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:29.053
THE CENSUS WE KNOW WE HAVE A

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.455
PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATION.

00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:32.156
THAT IS NOT A SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.825
AS WE WOULD NEED THEM TO BE AND

00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:35.360
AS ONE OF A MORE ALONG WITH

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.395
OTHER LEGISLATORS. ONE OF THE

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.464
PARTIES TO THE LAWSUIT AGAINST

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.366
THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION --

00:31:41.432 --> 00:31:42.400
WE HAVE AN UP HILL BATTLE AND

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:43.668
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.370
WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS OUR

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.704
DIVERSE COMMUNITIES --

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:47.905
TO ADDRESS THIS THERE'S SO MUCH

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:49.774
AT STAKE IN WITHOUT LOOKING FOR

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.710
TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIRS OF

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:53.344
THE SELECT COMMITTEES TO GET IT

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:53.945
RIGHT [inaudible]

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:56.080
THANK YOU.

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:57.615
YES I MADE A QUICK --

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:59.284
AS THE ASSEMBLY MEN OF THE FIFTY

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.118
NINE TO SENATE DISTRICTS SOUTH

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:00.785
LOS ANGELES.

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:03.254
AND THE FACT THAT WE PROBABLY

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:04.389
HAD THE WORST COUNT.

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.190
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:08.126
HERE TO MAKE SURE WE DO NOT HAVE

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:09.694
THE WORST COUNTY IN THE STATE OF

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.962
CALIFORNIA.

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.664
HOPEFULLY EVER AGAIN IT'S REALLY

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.465
IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY GET

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.800
EVERYONE COUNTED.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.502
BUT GROUPS THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.103
FEARFUL.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.371
SHE WAS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.707
GROUP THAT ARE FEARFUL TO COME

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:23.241
OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND BE

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.242
COUNTED.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.644
BECAUSE SOME ADVERSE THINGS MAY

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.212
HAPPEN TO THEM --

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.682
I AM KEENLY AWARE THAT AND WE

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.216
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.985
SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE --

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.353
WHEN THEY DO GET COUNTED AND

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.356
THEN THERE CAN'T KEEP DOING THE

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.824
SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND

00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.426
OVER AGAIN THE WAY WE COUNT

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:42.860
EXPECT?

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.529
A DIFFERENT RESULT WE'RE OFF TO

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:45.697
DO SOME INNOVATIVE THINGS TO GET

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.999
THESE DISCOUNT UP AND I'M HERE

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:51.102
TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND WHEN I

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:52.603
SAY PUSH THE ENVELOPE --

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.272
I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO BOTH

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.373
CHAIR STATE --

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.708
I'M VERY --

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:59.310
KEEN TO TRYING TO DO SOME THINGS

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:00.978
THAT ARE --

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:03.548
OUT OF THE BOX AND I DON'T CARE

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.716

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:09.053
AND GET IT DONE RIGHT.

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.667
WHAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AS

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:25.036
WE DIG INTO THIS IS THAT THERE

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:27.705
IS APPEARS TO BE A VERY?

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:30.775
ORGANIZED DELIBERATE.

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.745
OF STRATEGY AND PLAN TO NOT

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.247

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:40.618
AND OF THE DISTRICT THAT I

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.953

AND AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.496
THIS IS OF THE BIGGEST CONCERN

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:57.201
BUT IF WE'RE NOT SUFFICIENT NICE --

00:33:57.268 --> 00:34:00.405
IN CALIFORNIA --

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:01.973
THERE WE WILL BE ABLE.

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.509
TO RESPOND AND THE DRESS THE WAY

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.944
THAT THIS ORGANIZED OPPOSITION

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.781
IS TO DOING ACCOUNTS WHICH WE

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:11.616

IMPORTANT SELECT COMMITTEES WE

AM HAPPY THAT I AM ABLE TO SERVE

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:24.896
YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY REMEMBER AS

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:26.364
A YOUNG GIRL.

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.365
WALKING --

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:28.533
NEIGHBORHOOD BLACKS WITH MY

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:29.801
MOTHER --

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:32.003
WHILE SHE PARTICIPATED IN A

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.870
SENSE IS BY BEING A CENSUS

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.205
COUNTER SHE WAS A SEASONAL

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:35.106
WORKER.

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.275
AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN BLOCKS

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:41.045
IN BROOKLYN AND IN NEW YORK CITY --

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:44.415
COUNTING AND I DIDN'T.

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:45.883
I WAS DOING WITH HER.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:50.688
BUT SHE TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.156
DOING THIS.

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:55.860
AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS ABOUT

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.529
COUNTING EVERY SINGLE PERSON SO

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.932
THAT ADEQUATE APPROPRIATE

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:04.202
RESOURCES WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:06.437
THOSE COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:08.639
POOR COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.074
BLACK BROWN PORTER RICAN

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.542
COMMUNITIES --

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:12.844
IN BROOKLYN.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.245
AND IN NEW YORK.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:16.981
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.182
DIFFERENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:20.785
CONSISTENTLY UNDER COUNTED.

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:22.620
AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO SHIFT

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:25.156
THE PARADIGM. TO BECOMING A

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:26.691
STATE WHERE WE ARE APPROPRIATELY

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:27.625
COUNTED.

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:30.394
AND ALSO BEING VERY HONEST WITH

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:33.397
HOW FAMILIES ARE LIVING NOW.

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:35.566
WE ARE ALL NOT JUST ONE FAMILY

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:37.068
IN ONE HOUSE WE ARE DOUBLED UP

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:38.769
WE ARE TRIPLED UP WE DON'T HAVE

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:39.670
HOMES.

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:41.038
AND SO WE WILL HAVE A

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.940
RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT NEW

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.976
TECHNIQUES FOR HOW TO GET THE

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.878
INFORMATION OUT WITH HOW TO

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.846
COMMUNICATE WITH FOLKS IN A WAY

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:51.549
THAT THEY SEE CREDIBILITY AND

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.518
THE FOLKS DELIVERING THE MESSAGE.

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.219
AND IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:58.222
TRYING NEEDS TO GET THIS

00:35:58.289 --> 00:36:00.091

OURSELVES COUNTED WE HAVE TOO

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.995
MUCH AT STAKE AND I THINK WE

00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:05.663
SHOULD ALL BE SCARED.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.398
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.767
SEATS AS A RESULT OF BEING UNDER

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:10.735

THESE FOLKS WE CAN'T JUST

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.245
TELLING ONCE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.679

FEAR DOING OUTREACH TO A

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.440

TO NEED TO BE AND THE LANGUAGE

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.545
THAT THEY THAT THEY

00:46:54.611 --> 00:47:00.250
PREDOMINATELY SPEAK --

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.753

TRYING TO DISSUADE PEOPLE'S

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:11.495
PARTICIPATION IN THE CENSUS AND

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:12.696
BY HAVING THE MONEY AT THE LOCAL

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.164
LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:16.166
ALLOWS FOR RAPID RESPONSE ISN'T

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:18.068
HIS SHIFT RESOURCES WHERE NEEDED

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.836
TO HELP COMBAT SOME OF THOSE --

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.338
DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS THAT

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.340
MAY ARISE THROUGHOUT THE

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:25.842
ENUMERATION PROCESS --

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:26.510
SO ON THE NEXT SLIDE YOU KIND OF

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.011
SEE THE THE THE OVERALL FUNDING

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.546
ALLOCATION APPROACH I'M NOT

JUST A HIGH LEVEL CHARTER OF

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:34.952
WHERE ALL THE FUNDING IS BEING.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.154
PROPOSED AGO AS PART OF OUR

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.422
EFFORTS --

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:39.957
SO WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FIRST

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:40.691
IS REALLY WHAT WE CALL OUR

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.893
GROUND GAME OUR GROUND GAME IS.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.262
IS HOW WE ARE TARGETING ARE HARD

TO COUNT POPULATION SO THAT'S

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:48.332
BASICALLY WHERE THE HARD TO

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:49.666
COUNT POPULATION LIVES AND

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:50.934
THAT'S DONE THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.502
BASED OUT REACH.

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:53.937
AND WE DO THAT AND ONE OF THREE

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:56.340
WAYS OR COUNTIES THERE ARE A

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.909
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS --

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.010
AND OUR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS SO

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:01.478
THAT'S KIND OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.813
BASE AND THEN WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.348
IS WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR WHO THE

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:06.183
HARD TO COUNT OUR THAT IS THE

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.085
SECOND KIND OF LAKE HERE AND

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:08.919
IT'S REALLY.

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:10.487
WE TARGETED ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:11.321
SPECIFIC --

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:15.492
DEMOGRAPHIC AREAS AND WE ARE LOW

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.393

ORGANIZATIONS TO TARGET WHO

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.563
THESE POPULATIONS ARE.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.797
AND THEN THE THIRD AREA IS

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:21.865
REALLY OUR SECTOR BASE OUR

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:23.133
REGION THIS IS HOW DO WE GET TO

SO THAT WE CAN TARGET THOSE

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:28.905
EFFORTS BASED ON WHO THEY

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.741
INTERACT WITH ON A FREQUENT

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.609
BASIS.

COUNT INDEX.

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.301
AND IF THIS IS WHAT REALLY MAKES

00:48:57.367 --> 00:48:59.169
SOMEONE CAN HARD TO COUNT IT'S

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:00.604
MORE THAN JUST ETHNICITY BASE

INTO OUR INTERACTIVE MAP MEANS

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:35.737
THAT WE CAN SEE WHERE THOSE

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.339
RESPONSE RATES ARE IN RELATION

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.607
TO THE OUTREACH EFFORT THAT

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.075
WE'RE DOING SO FOR HOLDEN EVENTS

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.476
IN A CERTAIN COMMUNITY.

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:42.511
HOW IS THE RESPONSE RATE GOING

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.813
IS AT HIGHS AND LOW IN PART OF

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.414
THAT IS SO THAT WE CAN THEN

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.348
QUICKLY?

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.816
CHANGE RESOURCES IF WE NEED TO

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.384
ST HEY WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.919

YEAR BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:00.963
RATES ARE COMING IN VERY.

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:02.764
BAD IN THIS AREA SO THOSE ARE

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:06.201
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MAKE

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:06.835
TO MORE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:07.502
INCLUDED.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.605
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.606
SANTA ROSA THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.774
COUPLE QUESTIONS --

WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.677
TARGETED?

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:19.114

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:27.322
YOU MUST HAVE THAT FOR REGION'S.

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:29.625
SURE SO WE WE CAN GET YOU THE

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:30.259
BREAKDOWN BY REGION THAT WERE

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.027
REALLY I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS ALL

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.161
THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION --

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.364
HARD TO COUNT POPULATION WITHIN

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.832
CALIFORNIA OFFICE ACTUALLY --

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:38.700
EVERYONE'S A LITTLE OVER FIFTEEN

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:39.801
MILLION.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.937
LIKE A LITTLE OVER 50% OR LET

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:43.171
THE IN ALL AND THEN THERE'S A

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.406
FURTHER BREAKDOWN.

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.841
BUT IT'S IT'S OVER FIFTEEN

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:47.776
MILLION AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:50.679
FACTORS IS THAT OVER 27% OF THAT

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:51.413
HARD TO COUNT.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.715
THEIR FOREIGN BORN SO IT'S

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.184
ANOTHER --

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.853
UNIQUE CHALLENGE YOU KNOW

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.155
CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AMONG.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:00.822
BUT THE THREE OF THEM AT THE END

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.558
OF TEN MILLION AS HARD TO COUNT.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.893
TARGETED NUMBER.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.162
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.864
TO GET TO DO WHAT THEY'RE

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.332
SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS TO

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:11.767
PARTICIPATE IN THE CENSUS

01:16:11.833 --> 01:16:12.901
CORRECT THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.404
OKAY ANOTHER QUESTION IS --

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.939
ON THE EDUCATION SECTOR OUT

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:18.941
REACH -- I

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.677
KNOW IN TALKING TO SOME FOLKS --

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:25.814
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT CATION ON

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.683
AS INSTITUTIONS --

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.318
ESPECIALLY --

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.886
K. THROUGH TWELVE OR EVEN

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.187
YOUNGER.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:35.057
THAT WE HAVE OR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:35.757
THERE.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:38.427
THAT IS VERY EFFECTIVE.

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:41.029
OR COULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND I

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.898
KNOW THAT PART OF THE POPULATION

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.000
OF HARD TO COUNT I HAVE HEARD I

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.034
UNDERSTAND.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.502
ART NOT COUNTING OUR BABIES AND

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.937
OUR CHILDREN.

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.407
SO -- I

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:53.709
DON'T SEE HOW.

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:54.977
A MILLION LESS THAN TWO MILLION

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:57.746
DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:00.215
IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.951
COULD POSSIBLY WORK I MEAN IT

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:04.319
SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE --

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:06.021
IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.889
OF SOME OF THE WHAT ALREADY

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:11.059
EXISTS. TO GET THE MOST OUT OF

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.861
IT AND MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER --

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:17.566
EDUCATIONAL YOU KNOW MAYBE CARE

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:18.567
PROVIDERS ON THE ANSWER BUT BUT

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:21.069
CERTAINLY OUR K. THROUGH.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:24.006
TWELVE SO HOW HOW WOULD YOU.

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:26.875
I KNOW YOU SAY CAPTURES 98% OF

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.011
TARGETED POPULATION BUT AS

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.146
SENATOR CABALLERO SAID.

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.247
JUST.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.850
JUST SAYING YOU DID SOMETHING TO

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.785
REACH OUT TO THEM DOESN'T MEAN

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:38.420
YOU'VE ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE SO

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.156
HOW CAN YOU.

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.891
SPEND MORE TIME DESCRIBING THAT.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.127
SURE SO AS PART OF THE AT

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.429
EDUCATION SECTOR OUT REACH --

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.730
I WOULD I WOULD KEEP IN MIND

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.132
FIRST THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.233
POPULATION WERE TARGETING AT

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:52.401
MULTIPLE TOUCHES FROM DIFFERENT

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.036
GROUPS RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.737
ASKING OUR EDUCATION BASED

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.339
SCHOOLS TO DO IS.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:58.807
IS BASICALLY --

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.342
LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE REASON

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.576
WE'RE PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.478
IDENTIFY THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:04.679
THEY CAN SET UP KIOSKS WHERE

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.081
THEY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR PARENT

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:07.416
RESOURCE CENTERS WHERE THEY CAN

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.884
HAPPEN QUESTIONER SYSTEM CENTER

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.519
STAY OPEN LATE TO ALLOW PEOPLE

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:11.686
TO COME IN UTILIZED.

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:12.888
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MANY OF THE

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:15.357
SCHOOLS HAVE RELATED TO BE ABLE

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.591
TO HOPEFULLY GO ONLINE AND FILL

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.592
OUT THE CENSUS FORM.

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.461

TO A CURRICULUM AND GROUPS --

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.054
SO THAT WE CAN TEACH ABOUT THE

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.557
CENSUS DURING THE ACTUAL --

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:49.958

OVERALL CORRECT THEM ON ONGOING

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:11.580
BASIS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:12.147
TO JUST DO IT ONCE EVERY TEN

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.483
YEARS.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.451

ONE OF OUR FIFTEEN HARD TO

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.357
COUNTER MY GRAPHICS AND WE WE

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.059

WE DO HAVE.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:30.499

DEALS WITH THE OVERALL PICTURE.

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.756
HI IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.458
THE PAST DUE TO PREVIOUS OUR

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:24.359
SENSES --

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:25.994
ENDED UP --

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.962
IN UNDER COUNTS SO --

01:24:28.029 --> 01:24:28.830
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.833
THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THOSE --

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.401
EXPERIENCES A SPECIFICALLY

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.203
WHETHER IT WAS IT WAS IT BECAUSE

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.305
OF THE LANGUAGE ACCESS OR IN THE

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:44.078
SELECTION OF COMMUNITY GROUPS OR

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:46.247
YOU KNOW VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS

01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.450
FROM THE PREVIOUS TO OUR SENSES

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:50.652
THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM.

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:51.286
AND TO AVOID BASICALLY JUST I'M

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.487
AROUND.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:54.255
SO I I THINK THE VERY FIRST

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:55.156
THING THAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:55.757
IT.

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.425
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.727
THAT WHATEVER OUTREACH WE DO IS

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:01.796
DONE BY TRUSTED MESSENGERS

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:02.430
THAT'S WHAT WAS LEARNED IN THE

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.098
PREVIOUS CENSUSES THAT YOU CAN'T

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:06.468
DO IT AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL HERE

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:08.169
IN SACRAMENTO REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:09.404
DONE IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.372
BY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

01:25:11.439 --> 01:25:12.907
THE DAILY INTERACTION WITH THE

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.409
POPULATION THE ONES THAT THEY

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:15.944
TRUST THE MOST --

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.945
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:18.279
DO HERE WITH OUR CAMPAIGN IS

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:19.414
MAKING SURE WHERE.

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.548
FUNDING --

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:22.851

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:24.652
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.254
GET THAT MESSAGE OUT BECAUSE

01:25:26.321 --> 01:25:26.855
THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.156
TRUSTED PEOPLE WHEN WHEN

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.624
SOMEBODY COMES AND SAYS HEY

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.426

TO EMPLOYMENT AS OUR STRATEGY

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:44.806
HERE'S TO FUN THAT WHICH IS WHY

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.975

IN HOW THAT --

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:12.567
I'M ASSUMING OF COURSE THEY GET

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:13.101
THE MONEY AND THEN THEY'RE

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:14.202
FINDING SMALLER CBO'S TO

01:26:14.269 --> 01:26:15.570
DISTRIBUTE THAT TWO WITHIN OUR

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:15.904
COMMUNITIES.

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.305
I'M FROM EIGHT AT CONSTITUENCIES

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.607
STANDPOINT I CAN IMAGINE THAT

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:22.443
THIS MAY CAUSE --

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.512
SOME CONCERNED WITH OUR OUR

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:26.247

SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE SOME OF

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.719
THESE QUESTIONS IN ANTICIPATION

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:32.287
OF THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN

FOR THEM BEFORE WE LET THEIR

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:27.829
CONTRACT AND WHAT ARE THOSE

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:28.996
DELIVERABLES.

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:32.633
IT'S IT'S BEEN FOR THE MOST PART

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.770
IT IS WITH THE YOUR TD PLANS

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.638
THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND

THEN THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:40.074
INCLUDING ALL THE DATA THAT GOES

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.242
ALONG WITH THAT.

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.411
THAT WE WANT TO PUT INTO OUR

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:44.545
STATEWIDE --

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:46.214
ONLINE TOOLS THAT WE CAN MAP

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.583
WHAT'S BEING DONE FOR PURPOSES

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:49.550
OF SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:51.219
HOPEFULLY DEPLOYING THE

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.054
RESOURCES CHOI AND TO WEAR AREAS

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.489
WHERE WE SEE ISSUES AND I I

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.523
THINK THIS IS REALLY TOUGH FOR

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.058
ME THAT THIS IS A BALANCE RIGHT

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:57.225
SO.

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.526
PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:00.261
CBO'S ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:01.362
EFFECTIVE IN FILLING OUT THAT

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:02.230
PAPERWORK BUT THEY'RE THE MOST

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.531
EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY REACHING

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.532
THE COMMUNITY.

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:05.800
WE KIND OF HAVE A A DISCONNECT

01:30:05.867 --> 01:30:06.834
BETWEEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.069
ACTUALLY IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.337
THOSE PEOPLE CAN HIRE GRANT

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:11.439
WRITER OR SO THAT'S ONE REASON

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:13.374
WHY WE WENT WITH THE A. CDOS

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:14.475
BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.777
BE THE EXPERTS IN PROVIDING

01:30:15.843 --> 01:30:17.078
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.479
ADMINISTRATIVE CAPABILITIES TO

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:18.679

THOSE SMALLER CBO AND THEY'LL BE

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:21.716
CHOOSING THEM I'M SORRY THIS IS

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:23.651
LIKE BUT THEY'LL BE CHOOSING

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.953
THEM HOW LIKE BASED ON THEIR

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.122
STAFF THEIR BOARD WILL CHOOSE

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.390
WITH.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:30.792
IT'S JUST KIND OF A A BIG

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:32.560
DISCONNECT I I WOULD THINK

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:33.795
BETWEEN.

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:35.797
THE A. CBO'S AT LEAST IN AND MY

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.965
REGION AND THE ACTUAL CBO IS ON

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:38.966
THE GROUND AND I'M JUST

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:40.768
WONDERING WHO'S.

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:42.236
PROVIDING ARE YOU JUST FEEL

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:48.743
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MORE

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:49.977
RELATIONSHIPS AND WE SEE.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:50.645
THIS IS THE A A REALLY

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:51.312
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THIS

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:52.480
IS WHERE THE REGIONAL PROGRAM

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:53.147
MANAGERS ON THE OUT REACH TEAM.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:54.182
REALLY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AS

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.116
LEADERS.

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.418
THEY WILL HERE FOR A AND THEY

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:59.287
HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM SOME OF

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.155

COMMUNITY AT CETERA.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.628
AND SO THE RULE THE RPM REGIONAL

PROGRAM MANAGER --

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.799

NOTION AROUND TRUSTED MESSENGERS

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:21.942
IDEA OF A TRUSTED MESSENGER AND

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:23.978
MY IDEA OF A TRUSTED MESSENGER

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.579
MAY NOT BE THE SAME.

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.248
RIGHT AND SO AS WE ARE

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.283
CONSIDERING NONTRADITIONAL YOU

AS COUNTING EVERYONE SOMETIMES I

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:01.715
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND EVEN

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:02.716
WITHIN THE SYSTEMS THAT WERE

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:05.586

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.772

LOCALS IS IT YOU KNOW LA HAD THE

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:00.394
HOMELESS COUNT DATE FIGURE OUT

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:02.830
WAYS TO BE VERY GRASSROOTS AND

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.631
TO EXPAND THEIR REACH AS WIDE AS

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:05.032
POSSIBLE.

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.134
YOU KNOW I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.402
WE WERE ENROLLING FOLKS AND

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.503
COVER CALIFORNIA.

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.138
SO MANY CHALLENGES UNTIL THE

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:12.539
ELEVENTH HOUR WHEN PEOPLE

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:13.874
REACHED OUT AND SAID HEY AND IT

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.309
WAS A SIMPLE AS COMING UP WITH

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:17.344
AN IDEA LIKE PUT A KIOSK IN THE

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.445
MALL.

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:19.747
YOU NOBODY SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:20.848
SHOULDN'T COME UP AT THE

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.549
ELEVENTH HOUR.

01:40:22.616 --> 01:40:26.053
U KNOW WHAT I MEAN

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:26.754
SO.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.422
MAYBE I CAN EXPAND A LITTLE BIT

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:30.190
I MEAN ALL THESE AREAS ALL THAT

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:31.058
WE'RE MAKING IT WORKS IS ALL

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.526
PARTICIPATE IN WHAT'S CALLED A

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:33.894
LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:36.930
AND OUR RPM'S ARE ALSO --

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:37.965
ATTENDING THESE LOCAL COMPLETE

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:38.966
COUNT COMMITTEE SO WE HAVE ONE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.801
AT THE STATE LEVEL OR GETTING

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.202
IDEAS AND FEEDBACK --

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:43.504
FROM FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:45.139
ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.673
ARE ARE ARE AND THE COMMUNITY

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.941
BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:48.876
PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL ONES WHERE

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:49.977
THEY SHOULD BE GETTING THAT TYPE

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:51.512
OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS THE

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.480
BEST ENTITY. TO DO OUTREACH TO

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.682
THE SPECIFIC GROUP AND OUR AREA

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:56.850
IN DOING THAT THAT AIM AT THE

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:58.285
LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE WE'RE NOT

01:40:58.352 --> 01:40:59.586
TRYING TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AT

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:01.155
THE STATE LEVEL JUST FOR THE

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:02.189
REASON THAT YOU MENTIONED IS

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:03.490
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:04.491
KNOWING US WE TYPICALLY PUT A

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:05.225
LOT.

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:06.560
OF REALLY STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:07.661
THINGS BUT WE WANT THEM TO HAVE

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.297
SOME FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:11.165
BETTING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.700
WHO IS THE BEST ORGANIZATION TO

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:18.038
DO THAT OUT REACH --

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:20.774
WE CAN'T PRESCRIBE THAT HERE SO

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.109
THAT WE CAN BE AS HELPFUL AS

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:23.444
POSSIBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:25.712
THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS GETTING

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:26.280

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:27.648

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:28.849
OTHER THING.

FORM?

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:58.939
WE'VE I THINK THE CENSUS OFFICES --

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.874

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:06.446
MEETING AND THE ESTIMATE IS

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:08.415
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES --

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.850
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.485
BUREAU THAT --

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:13.587
ONE MUST COMPLETE THE ONLINE

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:16.690
QUESTIONNAIRE AND ONE SITTING IN

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:17.424
OTHER WORDS.

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:19.026
IT'S NOT A PROCESS WHERE ONE CAN

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:20.627
SIT AND STARTED SAVE IT AND COME

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.829
BACK TO IT LATER SO IT HAS TO BE

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:23.630
COMPLETED.

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.766

THE HOUSEHOLD WITH FOUR MEMBERS

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:35.142
HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE.

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:37.711
THE SENSE OF THIS SO I I THINK

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:40.981
THEY GIVE US AN AVERAGE SO IT'S

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:41.915

HOUSEHOLD SO SOMEWHERE AROUND.

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:48.689
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE AVERAGE

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:51.692
FIFTEEN MINUTES I TENANTS --

OKAY --

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:58.131
DEPEND ON HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THE

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:59.800
HOUSEHOLD UHHUH.

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:02.202

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:04.271
ALL RIGHT SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.339

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.508
PROCESS BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:10.210
NOT THAT THERE'S EVER BEEN

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:10.677
NINETY ISSUE WITH THE

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:11.378
GOVERNMENTAL.

BILL OR ORGANIZATION JUST

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:14.748
CURIOUS --

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.149
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THE

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:17.651
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DONE

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.186
THEIR ONLINE TESTING BUT I MEAN

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:20.253
I WOULD NEED TO GET A SPECIFIC

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.888
RESPONSE FROM THEM THEY'RE THE

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:22.756
ONES ACTUALLY ARE DOING THE

01:44:22.823 --> 01:44:24.291
ENUMERATION PROCESS AND DOING

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:25.926
ALL THAT THEY DID A A

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:27.127
COMPREHENSIVE --

01:44:27.194 --> 01:44:28.996
FEEL PASSED AND I BELIEVE IT WAS

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:31.098
SOMEWHERE IN DELAWARE IT WAS IN

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:32.199
PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND IT'S A

01:44:32.265 --> 01:44:34.501
SINGLE LOCATION WHERE THEY HAVE

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:35.335
TESTED.

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:39.039
OKAY AT ARE THEY GONNA TESTING

01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:39.640
CALIFORNIA AT ALL [inaudible]

01:44:39.706 --> 01:44:40.707
NOW [inaudible]

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.009
ALL RIGHT.

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:42.676
IN -- IN

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:43.577
ORDER TO I THINK THERE'S

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:44.878
CONSENSUS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:46.546
IS ACCURATE ACCOUNT AS IS

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:48.882
HUMANLY POSSIBLE OR EVEN

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:50.917
ELECTRONICALLY POSSIBLE --

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:52.285
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE NEED

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:55.489
AS LAWMAKERS TO DO TO FACILITATE

01:44:55.555 --> 01:44:56.857
THAT SO FORGET EXAMPLE THIS.

01:44:56.923 --> 01:45:00.527
IS ONE ONE EXAMPLE SCHOOLS --

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:01.128
ANYTHING WE NEED TO CHANGE THE

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:04.097
CODE. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:06.933
TO BE ABLE --

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:07.968
TO FOR EXAMPLE IN PARENT TEACHER

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.803
NIGHT MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE'RE

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:13.173
COUNTING EVERYBODY.

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.508
WILL SAY ONE THING.

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:15.909
TO ONE WHERE WE HAVE COMMITTED

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.244

THAT WE WILL PROVIDE --

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:24.151
TALKING POINTS THAT YOU MAY

01:45:24.217 --> 01:45:25.652

FORM OR PUBLIC SPEAKING

01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:29.423
ENGAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S AT A

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.758
SCHOOL. TO JUST START TO EDUCATE

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:32.859
AND IMPRESS UPON YOUR

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:35.395
CONSTITUENTS THE IMPORTANT.

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.329
THAT THAT'S THE THAT I

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:37.764
APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S A LITTLE

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:38.398
DIFFERENT THAN THE QUESTION I'M

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:40.834
ASKING SO IS THERE SOME CHANGE

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:41.968
IN THE LAW.

01:45:42.035 --> 01:45:43.870
THAT NEEDS TO BE ME I I GET THE

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:45.539
WILL GET TALKING POINTS AND WE

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:46.406
SHOULD BE.

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:49.142
PROSELYTISING IT WILL DO THAT SO

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.677
IS THERE ANYTHING IN LAW THAT

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:51.945
NEEDS TO BE CHANGED I GOT YOU I

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:56.116
ALSO GOT MORE RESOURCES PART I

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:59.886
GOT THAT PART BUT I'M AWARE OF

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:00.520
AND THEN YOU NEED.

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:01.421
FOR FOR ANY KIND OF CHANGE IN

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.656
STATUTE --

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:30.810
ACTUALLY ABLE TO THAT THEY'RE

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:32.679
TOUCHING EVERYONE AND I KNOW

01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:33.847
THAT ONE THE CHALLENGES I THINK

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:35.081
SOME PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:36.282
IS IS THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.818
WHAT HAPPENS USING IN A CBO IS

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:39.619
AN INTERFACE BECAUSE OF THE

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:40.320
STATE.

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:41.888
WE HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WE

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:43.356
HAVE ON OUR MONEY APPRECIATE

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:44.757
ACCOUNTABILITY PART AND

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:45.925
CERTAINLY I WANT PEOPLE TO BE

01:52:45.992 --> 01:52:47.994
ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO

01:52:48.061 --> 01:52:49.462
RECOGNIZE.

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:53.633
THE ELSE SO MY COLLEAGUES RAY

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.635
MENTIONED --

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:57.537
EFFECTIVE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE

01:52:57.604 --> 01:53:00.039
PEOPLE WHO HAVE OUT ITS THEY

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:01.508
DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW --

01:53:01.574 --> 01:53:02.509
THEY MEAN I'D BE YOU KNOW THEY

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:03.643
MEAN I'VE IN THAT YOU KNOW HAVE

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:05.411
SOME KIND OF TAX STATUS OR

01:53:05.478 --> 01:53:06.513
ANYTHING LIKE THAT COULD BE AN

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:07.847
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT OUR GROUP OF

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:08.915
INDIVIDUALS.

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:10.416
AND HOW TO BE SURE WE GET DOWN

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:11.484
TO THAT AND ACTUALLY FRANKLY

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.186
ALSO ON THE MEDIA SIDE.

01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:14.254
RIGHT -- SO

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.255
YOU KNOW YOU START TALKING OKAY

01:53:15.321 --> 01:53:16.556
GREAT THE BIG MEDIA COMPANIES

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:19.125
EASY YOU START DRILLING DOWN

01:53:19.192 --> 01:53:20.093
WEDNESDAY AT THE MEDIA WHAT YOU

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.561
MEAN BY ETHNIC MEDIA RIGHT AND

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:23.196
AND SO WE REALLY DOWN OR MEDIA

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:23.830
THING.

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:26.332
AGAIN AND SO I'M HOPING IS IS

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:28.501
THAT MAYBE YOU CAN JUST TOUCH ON

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.969
IT TO DO IT YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.604
DISTRICT OFFICES SO WE DON'T

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:32.872
KNOW EVERYBODY BUT THEY KNOW A

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:35.108
LOT OF PEOPLE --

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:36.543

PROGRAM MANAGERS TO BUT THE

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:41.014
GREEN THAT --

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.148
THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OF

01:53:42.215 --> 01:53:43.483
REQUIREMENT THAT IS THEY'RE

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.751
DOING TO MEDIA BUYS AND THEY'RE

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:46.586
ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEY'RE

01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:47.220
DOING THAT OUR REACH THAT THEY

01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:48.855

GOT THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD PEOPLE

01:53:55.061 --> 01:53:56.696
THAT MAYBE OUR DISTRICT OFFICES

01:53:56.763 --> 01:53:57.764
OF WORKED WITH A NO THROUGH.

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.032

PAST TWO WEEKS SO I I JUST.

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:29.729

01:54:29.796 --> 01:54:31.698
TO CUT IT OFF BY IT AND BUT WE

01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:34.667

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:38.204
YOU KNOW I I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:40.073
IN MY THE ACBL IN MY AREA AND

01:54:40.139 --> 01:54:40.873
I'VE WORKED WITH THEM BEFORE BUT

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.507
YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BLIND SPOTS

01:54:41.574 --> 01:54:42.709
THEY HAVE PEOPLE THERE USED TO

01:54:42.775 --> 01:54:44.043
WORKING WITH AND SOMETIMES

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:45.011
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PEOPLE

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:46.045
WHOM.

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.280
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING

01:54:47.347 --> 01:54:48.414

SOME ARE BETTER AT WORKING WITH

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:54.387
SOME THAN OTHERS AND SO WE WANT

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:55.121

RUNNING COME JANUARY I THINK

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:36.322
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS.

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:37.790

02:01:42.261 --> 02:01:43.095
THAT.

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.231
EVERYONE IS EDUCATED ABOUT IT

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:48.434
YEAH AND BE AN EVEN MORE

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:49.935
CHALLENGING TASK --

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:50.569

KIND OF FORMULATING YOUR

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:54.440
TIMELINE IS IS THE EARLIER THE

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:55.741
BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO STARTING

02:01:55.808 --> 02:01:57.743
TO REACH OUT OBVIOUSLY THE HEAVY

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:58.811
LIFT WILL COME.

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:01.047

TO BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE AT

02:02:19.165 --> 02:02:21.467
THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT TASKS ON

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:22.568
A SOME OF THEM --

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:25.705
ARE GOING TO BE ORGANIZING FOR

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:27.039
LACK OF A BETTER WORD IN.

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:28.741
THE HALF DOZEN OR MORE COUNTIES --

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.876
THEY HAVE TO BE ORGANIZING WITH

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:33.813
THE THE LOCAL CBO'S --

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:34.780
THE DISTRICT OFFICES FOR

COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE IS AS A

02:02:40.953 --> 02:02:43.155

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:45.324
ARE YOU KNOW IT IS THAT WORKLOAD

02:02:45.391 --> 02:02:46.826
MANAGEABLE FOR THEM TO REALLY

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.594
ALSO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT'S

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:49.962
GOING ON AND BE --

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:51.197
COORDINATING THE EFFORTS IN

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:53.466
THEIR REGIONS.

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.201
THUS THE DESIGN OF

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:57.269
ADMINISTRATIVE CBO.

02:02:57.336 --> 02:02:59.905
AND WITH THAT STRUCTURE AND

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.407
OPERATION --

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:03.542
THE WORK IS --

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.578
MANAGEABLE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT

02:03:05.644 --> 02:03:08.748
IS A HUGE WORKLOAD --

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:11.217
YOU KNOW IF I GOT MY GENERAL

02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:13.119
MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS DEGREE.

02:03:13.185 --> 02:03:14.487
THIS IS LIKE.

02:03:14.553 --> 02:03:16.622
BOTH WAYS IT WAS MY DREAM JOB

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:16.922
WITH -- KIND

02:03:16.989 --> 02:03:18.891
OF LIKE A YOU KNOW STRATEGIC

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:20.493
MANAGEMENT BUT THAT THAT IS WHY

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:23.028
THE DESIGN AS IT IS MAKES SENSE

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:25.064
AS OPPOSED TO CONTRACTING WITH.

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.899
INDIVIDUAL CBO'S CONTRACTING

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:28.501
WITH INDIVIDUAL CITIES BECAUSE

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.536
OF THE THE BUDGET THAT WE'VE

02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:33.072
BEEN ALLOCATED AND THE RESOURCES

02:03:33.139 --> 02:03:34.440
BEHIND THAT THE THAT STRUCTURE

02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:37.343
WORKS RIGHT NOW SOME COUNTY --

02:03:37.409 --> 02:03:39.345
SOME REGIONS ARE LITTLE.

02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:40.613
HEAVIER ON THE COUNTY SIDE.

02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:43.983
I'LL GIVE YOU A GREAT EXAMPLE --

02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:45.751
YOU KNOW REASON ONE HAS LIKE

02:03:45.818 --> 02:03:48.454
TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES --

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.556
HOW HOWEVER YOU KNOW LA HAS ONE

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.725
COUNTY HOWEVER ONLY HAS NINETY

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.293
CITIES THAT HAVE?

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.061
A SIGNIFICANT --

02:03:56.128 --> 02:03:57.630
HARD TO COUNT POPULATION WITHIN

02:03:57.696 --> 02:04:00.166
THEM SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF

02:04:00.232 --> 02:04:01.700
THOSE FACTORS.

02:04:01.767 --> 02:04:03.302
AND DIVIDED UP THE WORK LOAD

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:04.703
ACCORDINGLY.

02:04:04.770 --> 02:04:06.005
PLAYING A GAME OF CHESS SINCE

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.540
SEPTEMBER AS WE'VE BEEN ADDING

02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:09.942

ABSOLUTELY EDUCATING FOLKS ON

02:04:11.777 --> 02:04:13.112
THE GROUND VARYING DEGREES OF

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.713
AWARENESS OF THE CENSUS AND ITS

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.515

THE OXYGEN EDUCATION PHASE GOES

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.187
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

02:04:21.253 --> 02:04:23.622
AND JANUARY ACTIVATION THAT'S

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:24.924
KIND OF LIKE GET OUT THE VOTE

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.457
IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHEN WE

STARTED WAS REALLY ACTIVATE

02:04:26.826 --> 02:04:29.161
FOLKS THAT'S WHAT THAT IS I'LL

02:04:29.228 --> 02:04:30.429
JUST ADD TO IS THAT.

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:32.031
FROM OUR LAST LEGISLATIVE REPORT

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:33.132
THAT WE PROVIDED WE ACTUALLY DID

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:35.568
A REASSESSMENT WE LOOKED AT THE

02:04:35.634 --> 02:04:36.969
RPM WE ACTUALLY BUMPED UP BY

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:38.304
ADDING A COUPLE TO SMALL STAFF

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.538
GUNS WITH THE LEVELS THAT WE

02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:40.639
COULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WE ADDED

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:41.941
AN ADDITIONAL LEAD. TO THE

02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:43.709
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AREAS THAT WE

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:45.110
HAVE A LEAD IN NORTHERN SOUTHERN

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:46.645
AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND WE

02:04:46.712 --> 02:04:48.080
ADDED AN ADDITIONAL --

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:49.582
RPM POSITION IN GENERAL TO HELP

FORESAW COUNTY --

02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:58.891
AND THEN A QUESTION ON THE THE

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.626
THE FUNDING OVERVIEW WHAT IS

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:01.594
STATE PROGRAMMATIC COSTS I KNOW

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.428
IT'S A LINE ITEM UNDER EVERY

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:04.997
DIFFERENT CATEGORY --

02:05:05.064 --> 02:05:06.031
RIGHT YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

OUR STATE PROGRAM COSTS AT THE

02:05:06.732 --> 02:05:07.233
COST OF ACTUALLY RUNNING OUT

THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:01.899
THEY WERE QUESTIONS ANSWERED

02:24:01.966 --> 02:24:03.835
EARLIER NEXT TIME ALLOWS WOULD

02:24:03.901 --> 02:24:06.104

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.017
WE LEARNED.

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.818
IN RAMPING UP COVERED CALIFORNIA

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:22.453
IN TERMS OF MARKETING.

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.055
SO THAT LOTS OF OUR SIMILARITIES

02:24:24.122 --> 02:24:25.156
BETWEEN THE TACIT COVER

02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:27.091
CALIFORNIA HAD IN THE TASK YOU

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:30.895
HAVE BEFORE YOU --

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:31.429
BOTH OF US NEEDED TO REACH

02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:34.899
HARDER TO AND USING TRUSTED

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:37.301
MESSENGERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:38.302
BOTH OF US ARE USING A

02:24:38.369 --> 02:24:40.872
COMBINATION OF GROUND TROOPS AND

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:42.573
OUR MARKETING EFFORTS.

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:45.309
BOTH OF US ARE NEED TO WORK BOB

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:45.877
COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:47.311
GOVERNMENT.

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:49.414
AND ARE WORKING UNDER. FOR LACK

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:50.615
OF A BETTER WORD RIDICULOUS TIME

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:54.385
LINES TO GET THESE THINGS DONE.

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:55.720
FOR COVER CALIFORNIA WE DID A

02:24:55.787 --> 02:24:57.088
LOT OF PLANNING JUST AS YOU DID

02:24:57.155 --> 02:24:59.023
AND ONE OF THE LAST COMPOSED TO

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:01.025
BE ADDED IN REALLY FLESHED OUT

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:02.460
WAS THE MARKETING CAMPAIGN.

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:04.195
IN MAY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN WE

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:05.630
MAILED ON OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:07.065
ADVERTISING AGENCY.

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:08.800
IN JULY OF THE SAME YEAR WE

02:25:08.866 --> 02:25:10.935
HIRED OUR FIRST MARKETING STAFF.

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:13.604
AND BY SEPTEMBER WE HAD A FULL

02:25:13.671 --> 02:25:15.540
COMPLETE CAMPAIGN IN THE

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.608
MARKETPLACE PROMOTING COVER

02:25:17.675 --> 02:25:19.777
CALIFORNIA.

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:21.379
BASED ON THE TYPE TIMELINE WE

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:23.548
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:25.216
EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF THINGS.

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:26.584
WHAT IS WE ENDED UP WITH A

02:25:26.651 --> 02:25:29.020
REALLY GREAT ADVERTISING AGENCY

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:30.788
THAT WENT THE EXTRA MILE OVER

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.123
AND OVER AGAIN THEY DID THINGS

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.558
THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT

02:25:33.624 --> 02:25:34.926
GO AGAINST EVERYTHING YOU'RE

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.027
SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEY WERE

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:37.295
SUCCESSFUL --

02:25:37.361 --> 02:25:38.696
IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH AGENCY TO

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:40.431
GET THE JOB DONE BUT WAS ALSO

02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:42.567
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IT COULD

02:25:42.633 --> 02:25:43.935
BRING IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:45.937
WOULD WE NEED THAT THEM AND THAT

02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:47.438
WAS OFTEN --

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:48.873
WE WERE ALSO LUCKY THAT COVER

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.741
CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO HIRE A

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:51.909
FEW PEOPLE.

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:53.511
MYSELF INCLUDED WHO ALREADY HAD

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:54.912
WORKED ON MARKETING CAMPAIGNS

02:25:54.979 --> 02:25:56.881
WHO KNEW THE STATE RULES AND HOW

02:25:56.948 --> 02:25:58.516
TO MANAGE A CONTRACT AND HOW TO

02:25:58.583 --> 02:25:59.784
GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR DOLLARS.

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:02.053
LASTLY WE HAD A VERY SUPPORT OF

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.688
LEADERSHIP TEAM AND THAT

02:26:03.754 --> 02:26:05.223
LEADERSHIP TEAM DID A LOT OF

02:26:05.289 --> 02:26:08.192
WORK IN TERMS OF GETTING AROUND

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:09.460
STATE PROCESS NOT THAT GETTING

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:10.828
AROUND IS THE WRONG PHRASE. TO

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:13.097
MAXIMIZING STATE PROCESSES SO WE

02:26:13.164 --> 02:26:14.732
DIDN'T GET BOGGED DOWN IN STATE

02:26:14.799 --> 02:26:16.300
PROCESSES WHICH SOMETIMES

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.835
HAPPENS.

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.537
COVERED CALIFORNIA INVEST ABOUT

02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:21.305
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:23.541
ON MARKETING OUTREACH AND THAT'S

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:25.243
A COMBINATION OF OUR COMMUNITY

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:27.512
GROUNDS ARE OP COLUMNS AND A

02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:28.913
MARKETING CAMPAIGN.

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:30.348
THE ACTUAL ADVERTISING BAD

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:32.550
BUDGET ITSELF IS BETWEEN FORTY

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:33.084
ONE AND FORTY TWO MILLION

02:26:33.151 --> 02:26:34.085
DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.186
WITH A LARGER AMOUNT SPENT IN

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:38.189
THE FIRST YEAR COVERS CREATIVE

02:26:38.256 --> 02:26:40.057
RESEARCH PRODUCTION COLLATERAL

02:26:40.124 --> 02:26:41.592
SOCIAL MEDIA.

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.961
AND TV AND RADIO PLACEMENT THE

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:46.130
VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS GO TO

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:48.699
BY MEDIA TIME.

02:26:48.766 --> 02:26:51.102
SO I'M OFTEN ASKED WHY THIS

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:52.537
MEDIA COST SO MUCH MONEY.

02:26:52.603 --> 02:26:54.539
AND CAL IS BASED ON HOW MANY

02:26:54.605 --> 02:26:56.174
PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATED TO SEE

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.042
ANY GIVEN AT AND A STATE LIKE

02:26:58.109 --> 02:27:00.011
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE SIZES SO

02:27:00.077 --> 02:27:01.345
LARGE -- IT

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.247
COST MORE COOPER JUST LARGE

02:27:03.314 --> 02:27:05.316
CALIFORNIA HAS WITHIN IT IF TALK

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:06.384
OF THE TOP TWENTY GENERAL

02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.586
MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:10.221
THREE OF THE TOP GENERAL MARKETS

02:27:10.288 --> 02:27:11.355
IN FOR THE ENGLISH MARKET.

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:14.392
AND FIVE OF THE TOP LATINO

02:27:14.458 --> 02:27:15.760
MARKETS OF THE UNITED STATES.

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:17.595
AND I COULD GO WITH OTHER

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:19.697
MARKETS BUT YOU GET THE PICTURE.

02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:20.498
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

02:27:20.565 --> 02:27:21.399
LEARNED THAT IS WORK

02:27:21.465 --> 02:27:23.534
SUCCESSFULLY FOR US IS A LAYERED

02:27:23.601 --> 02:27:24.869
APPROACH TO BUYING MEDIA.

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:26.437
THERE ARE MORE MEDIA CHOICES

02:27:26.504 --> 02:27:28.873
THAT ANYBODY COULD POSSIBLY

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:29.373
AFFORD TO BUY.

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:32.176
AND MEDIA'S CONSUMPTION OF

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:33.711
PEOPLE'S CONSUMPTION OF MEDIA

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.379
VARIES BY THEIR AGE THEIR INCOME

02:27:35.446 --> 02:27:36.914
THEIR EDUCATION AND WHAT'S

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.816
AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO GIVE YOU

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:40.284
JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS IS

02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:42.286
COMPLICATED IF YOU THINK OF THE

02:27:42.353 --> 02:27:43.387
LATINO POPULATION AND I'M A TALK

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:44.956
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS VERY BROADLY.

02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:47.158
THEIR PEOPLE ONLY SPEAK SPANISH

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:48.693
THEIR LATINOS WHO FEEL VERY

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:49.860
TACTILE THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY

02:27:49.927 --> 02:27:51.796
ONLY SPEAK ENGLISH AND THEN THE

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:53.397
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN BETWEEN WHO

02:27:53.464 --> 02:27:54.632
CAN SPEAK BOTH LANGUAGES.

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:56.400
SO IF WE JUST BOUGHT SPANISH

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:59.170
LANGUAGE MEDIA WE WOULDN'T REACH

02:27:59.237 --> 02:28:00.204
THE PEOPLE AND THERE'S A BIG

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:01.706
PART SENATOR PEOPLE IN

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:03.007
CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T SPEAK

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:04.575
SPANISH WHO ARE VERY MUCH RELATE

02:28:04.642 --> 02:28:05.876
TO THAT CULTURE.

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:10.314
SO WE BY SPANISH MEDIA IN THE IN

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:12.350
CAN TELL SPECIFIC SHOWS THAT

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:14.318
HAVE HIGH VIEWERSHIP OF LATINOS

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:15.820
AND WE ALSO BY THOSE SHOWS.

02:28:15.886 --> 02:28:16.988
AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:28:17.054 --> 02:28:18.522
BILINGUAL WE MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:20.491
MESSAGES THAT RUN IN SPANISH TV

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:22.693
AN ENGLISH TV ARE COMPLEMENTARY

02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.362
SO IT'S NOT A CONFUSION FOR THE

02:28:24.428 --> 02:28:24.929
PERSON WHO'S WATCHING BOTH

02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:26.030
LANGUAGES.

02:28:26.097 --> 02:28:27.498
AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

02:28:27.565 --> 02:28:28.566
ONE LANGUAGE THERE'S A DIFFERENT

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:30.735
THAT DYNAMIC FOR ALMOST EVERY

02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:32.803
ETHNIC COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:37.108
CALIFORNIA.

02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:38.643
SO WE'VE ALSO FOUND.

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:41.545
THAT HAVING ONE STATEWIDE AGENCY

02:28:41.612 --> 02:28:43.981
WITH ETHNIC SUBCONTRACTORS WITH

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:45.416
EXPERTISE IN REACHING THEIR

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:46.450
COMMUNITIES.

02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:48.052
COMBINED WITH THE STATE WIDE

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:49.520
STRATEGIC PLAN WORKS BEST.

02:28:49.587 --> 02:28:51.222
SO THAT WE END OF SPEAKING WITH

02:28:51.289 --> 02:28:53.257
ONE VOICE HAVING CONSISTENT

02:28:53.324 --> 02:28:55.059
MESSAGING AND CLEAR MESSAGING

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.460
FOR EVERYBODY.

02:28:56.527 --> 02:28:58.195
WHILE THE PLAN IS STATEWIDE IT

02:28:58.262 --> 02:28:59.497
IS INFUSED WITH.

02:28:59.563 --> 02:29:00.865
ETHNIC IN LANGUAGE AND HYPER

02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:03.434
LOCAL MEDIA TO ENSURE WE HAVE

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:04.302
THE STRONGEST MEDIA [inaudible]

02:29:04.368 --> 02:29:06.037
PENETRATION.

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.705
WHILE WE HAVE GREAT CONTRACTORS

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:09.173
IT REMAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:11.175
THE STATE STAFF TO MAKE SURE

02:29:11.242 --> 02:29:12.443
THAT WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:14.278
DIVERSITY WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO

02:29:14.345 --> 02:29:15.613
MAKE SURE ARE WE REACHING.

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.515
THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATIONS

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:19.150
WERE TRYING TO GET TO AND THEN

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:20.918
THAT COULD BE ETHNIC OR LANGUAGE

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:23.087
OR GEOGRAPHIC.

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:24.355
I HAVE WORKED AND NO OTHER

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:26.390
PROGRAMS WHERE THEY USED MORE

02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:28.492
REGIONAL APPROACH AND WHILE IT

02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:30.161
SOUNDS GOOD THERE ARE SOME

02:29:30.227 --> 02:29:31.662
DOWNFALLS TO USING A MORE

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:32.863
REGIONAL APPROACH.

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.099
WANTED CAUSES HORRIFIC PROBLEMS

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:36.400
INTERESTS ACCORDING ATION YOU

02:29:36.467 --> 02:29:38.302
GET IN CONSISTENT MESSAGING THE

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:40.071
BIG COUNTIES CAN DO IT BETTER

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:42.139
THE SMALL COUNTIES HAVE VERY

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:44.308
LITTLE TO NO FUNDING --

02:29:44.375 --> 02:29:46.677
IT CAUSES INCREASE PRODUCTION

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:48.179
COST AND DUPLICATE COSTS AND

02:29:48.245 --> 02:29:50.614
LASTLY THERE BUYING EFFICIENCIES

02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:53.951
WHERE YOU COULD REALLY MAP OUT.

02:29:54.018 --> 02:29:55.152
A PROGRAM --

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:56.253
SO THAT YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.122
THE DOLLARS AND I SHOULD ADD ONE

02:29:58.189 --> 02:29:58.589
MORE.

02:29:58.656 --> 02:30:02.159
MEDIA THE CIRCLED MEDIA GOES OUT

02:30:02.226 --> 02:30:04.562
IS NOT BASED ON COUNTY LINES SO

02:30:04.628 --> 02:30:06.230
SOME COUNTIES MIGHT GET THREE

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:07.732
DIFFERENT STATIONS I MEAN.

02:30:07.798 --> 02:30:08.666
YOU KNOW MAYBE MAKE IT SAN

02:30:08.733 --> 02:30:10.267
FRANCISCO MEDIA THEY MIGHT GET

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:11.836
SACRAMENTO MEDIA AND THEY MIGHT

02:30:11.902 --> 02:30:13.938
GET SHE GOT ME TO GET JUST

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:19.543

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE THERE

02:38:25.562 --> 02:38:27.064
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TO MAKE SURE

02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:28.832
THAT THEY HAVE CAPACITY THAT

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:30.334
THEY WERE WELL RESPECTED THAT

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:31.468
THEY HAD LEADERSHIP --

02:38:31.535 --> 02:38:33.170
CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY AND

02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:34.905
THAT THEY WERE REPRESENTING THE

02:38:34.972 --> 02:38:36.473
RIGHT GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.108
THE HARD TO COUNT WERE IN FACT

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:39.543
COVERED IN IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY

02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:41.378
AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY

02:38:41.445 --> 02:38:43.547

02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:46.550
COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE --

02:38:46.617 --> 02:38:49.319
IS IS REPRESENTED --

02:38:49.386 --> 02:38:50.454
AND THEN WANTED KINDA LAST POINT

02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:51.388
THAT HASN'T COME UP IN ANY OF

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:54.258
THE CONVERSATIONS IN AND AROUND

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:55.893
THE THAT THE CENSUS AND ALL.

02:38:55.959 --> 02:38:57.594
AND I KNOW THAT WE TALK ABOUT --

02:38:57.661 --> 02:38:59.429
NUMBER OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS WE

02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:00.664
TALK ABOUT STATE --

02:39:00.731 --> 02:39:02.466
LOSS OF OF FUNDING FROM THE

02:39:02.532 --> 02:39:04.501
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT WE DON'T

02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:06.336
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS HOW THE

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:08.071
STATE OF CALIFORNIA USES CENSUS

02:39:08.138 --> 02:39:09.139
DATA.

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:11.375
AND I'VE WRITTEN A TON OF GRANTS

02:39:11.441 --> 02:39:14.611
ON BOND GRANT THAT'S GOING

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:15.846
THROUGH --

02:39:15.913 --> 02:39:17.915
FUNDING RIGHT NOW HAS MILLIONS

02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:19.783
OF DOLLARS THAT GOES I GO OUT ON

02:39:19.850 --> 02:39:21.418
A PER CAPITA BASIS.

02:39:21.485 --> 02:39:22.953
SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:24.087
THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN

02:39:24.154 --> 02:39:25.389
HOW IS THIS GOING TO AFFECT THE

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:27.357
DATA AND HOW WE DISTRIBUTE

02:39:27.424 --> 02:39:29.026
FUNDING TO OUR OWN STATE.

02:39:29.092 --> 02:39:30.894
AND WE AND WITH IT IF IF IF WE

02:39:30.961 --> 02:39:32.329
DON'T GET IT RIGHT YOU KNOW WE

02:39:32.396 --> 02:39:34.364
RUN SERVICE SEVERE RISK OF

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.799
LOSING REGIONS THAT YOU KNOW IN

02:39:35.866 --> 02:39:37.467
SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF OF THE

02:39:37.534 --> 02:39:38.502
STATE.

02:39:38.568 --> 02:39:40.003
ARE BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE IN

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:41.471
AN ACCURACY OF THE DATA THAT

02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:42.906
WE'RE COLLECTING SOUGHT I REALLY

02:39:42.973 --> 02:39:44.074
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET

02:39:44.141 --> 02:39:45.309
THAT ON OUR RADAR --

02:39:45.375 --> 02:39:46.810
AND HONE IN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:48.078
CONNECTING THE DOTS TO ALL THE

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.780
FUNDING CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTES

02:39:49.846 --> 02:39:51.381
ON YOUR CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS

02:39:51.448 --> 02:39:52.716
NAME IT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY

02:39:52.783 --> 02:39:54.051
CARVE OUT.

02:39:54.117 --> 02:39:55.485
SO THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE POINTS

02:39:55.552 --> 02:39:58.255
I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK.

02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:59.957
TO THANK YOU.

02:40:00.023 --> 02:40:00.557
SO I WANTED TO EXPAND ON ONE

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:02.159
AREA THAT I HAD SPOKEN TO ABOUT

02:40:02.225 --> 02:40:03.160
LAYERED MEDIA.

02:40:03.226 --> 02:40:05.862
SO WE DO AND USE THAT.

02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:07.698
MAJOR MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO DO

02:40:07.764 --> 02:40:09.967
AN UMBRELLA CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE

02:40:10.033 --> 02:40:11.435
PEOPLE TO MOTIVATE THEM TO TELL

02:40:11.501 --> 02:40:12.869
THEM WHAT THE DEADLINES ARE.

02:40:12.936 --> 02:40:14.938
AND I HAVE BEEN BUYING ETHNIC

02:40:15.005 --> 02:40:17.874
MEDIA FOR THIRTY YEARS SO I'M.

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:18.875
A BIG BELIEVER.

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:21.178
BUT IN THE BROAD KIND OF REACH

02:40:21.244 --> 02:40:22.713
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THEIR ART

02:40:22.779 --> 02:40:25.315
ETHNIC MEDIA IN ALL THE AREAS

02:40:25.382 --> 02:40:26.249
YOU NEED THERE TO BE ETHNIC

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:27.250
MEDIA.

02:40:27.317 --> 02:40:29.186
AN ETHNIC MEDIA FOLLOWS WHERE

02:40:29.252 --> 02:40:30.654
THERE'S POPULATIONS.

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:32.622
SO --

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:35.258
THERE'S A LOT OF ASIANS THE BAY

02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:36.426
AREA BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:40:36.493 --> 02:40:37.728
PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BUT IF YOU

02:40:37.794 --> 02:40:40.364
LIVE OUTSIDE THAT AREA OR LA

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:42.065
THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY MEDIA.

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:43.333
THAT REACHES PEOPLE WHO DON'T

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:44.968
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE SO YOU HAVE

02:40:45.035 --> 02:40:47.070
TO REALLY LOOK AT LAYERING AND

02:40:47.137 --> 02:40:48.205
DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDIA TO

02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:49.840
REACH DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND

02:40:49.906 --> 02:40:52.042
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE --

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:55.112
AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF

02:40:55.178 --> 02:40:57.481
THE BEST EXAMPLE I COULD BE GIVE

02:40:57.547 --> 02:40:59.249
IS OF ANY USE THE SACRAMENTO BEE.

02:40:59.316 --> 02:40:59.883
I WOULD DISSECT WILL BE EVERY

02:40:59.950 --> 02:41:01.518
DAY IF YOU PUT AN AD IN THE

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:04.721
SACRAMENTO BEE ONCE A WEEK FOR

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:06.123
THE WHOLE NEXT YEAR.

02:41:06.189 --> 02:41:08.058
I'LL READ IT A COUPLE TIMES BUT

02:41:08.125 --> 02:41:09.526
I WILL READ IT EVERY SINGLE DAY

02:41:09.593 --> 02:41:10.560
BECAUSE AFTER AWHILE GET USED TO

02:41:10.627 --> 02:41:11.128
IT.

02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:13.563
BUT I READ THE SECOND MAYBE IT

02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:15.298
EVEN IF YOU USE THAT PAPER EVERY

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:16.400
SINGLE WEEK.

02:41:16.466 --> 02:41:17.501
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER

02:41:17.567 --> 02:41:18.835
READ THE SACRAMENTO BEE AND HAS

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:19.970
NOTHING TO SAY WITH THE QUALITY

02:41:20.037 --> 02:41:20.837
OF THE MEDIA OR ANYTHING LIKE

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:22.406
THAT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME

02:41:22.472 --> 02:41:23.840
PEOPLE ARE GOOD ONLY LISTEN.

02:41:23.907 --> 02:41:26.810
AND TO SOCIAL MEDIA SOME PEOPLE

02:41:26.877 --> 02:41:28.512
ARE GOING TO WATCH TELEVISION

02:41:28.578 --> 02:41:29.713
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE A

02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:30.881
BILLBOARD SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING

02:41:30.947 --> 02:41:32.149
TO READ THE NEWSPAPER YOU HAVE

02:41:32.215 --> 02:41:33.617
TO DO A VARIETY OF THINGS

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:35.685
BECAUSE YOU CAN COUNT ON ONE OR

02:41:35.752 --> 02:41:37.621
TWO VEHICLES TO GET EVERYBODY

02:41:37.687 --> 02:41:39.122
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THAT.

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:41.324
SIMILAR AND IT --

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:45.262
VIEWERSHIP AB ETHNICITIES AND

02:41:45.328 --> 02:41:45.862
THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

02:41:45.929 --> 02:41:47.697
FACTORS BUT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS

02:41:47.764 --> 02:41:49.466
HAVE A WHOLE MARKETING AGENCIES

02:41:49.533 --> 02:41:51.368
OF PEOPLE SO MEDIA HAVE REALLY

02:41:51.435 --> 02:41:54.071
HOLD THEIR ABILITY TO PINPOINT --

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:55.672
HOW TO SELL YOU A PRODUCT AND

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:58.375
THE CENSUS IS IN A VERSION --

02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:00.243
I KIND OF PRODUCT --

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:03.013
THE OTHER THING I BECAUSE I KNOW

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.214
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A REGIONAL

02:42:04.281 --> 02:42:04.481
APPROACH.

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.515
I WOULDN'T.

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.017
THE FIRST YEAR OF COVER

02:42:07.084 --> 02:42:09.386
CALIFORNIA WE LET OUT LOTS AND

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.321
LOTS AND LOTS OF GRANTS AND WE

02:42:11.388 --> 02:42:17.427
HAD PEOPLE AT FAIRS AND FARMERS

02:42:17.494 --> 02:42:18.595
MARKETS EVERY PLACE YOU CAN

02:42:18.662 --> 02:42:19.863
THINK OUT THERE WITH THEIR

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:20.097
LITTLE.

02:42:20.163 --> 02:42:22.399
NOT KIOSK WOULD LIKE A TABLE AND

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:23.967
BROCHURES AND THINGS TO HAND OUT.

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:26.470
AND IT WAS AND PEOPLE WOULD COME

02:42:26.536 --> 02:42:29.973
TO BE YOU NEED TO PROMOTE WHEN

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:30.674
I'M DOING OUT OF THE AT THE

02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:32.342
FARMERS MARKET.

02:42:32.409 --> 02:42:34.444
IN SOME CASES THERE WOULD BE A

02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:36.179
THOUSAND EVENTS.

02:42:36.246 --> 02:42:37.180
OVER A WEEKEND.

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:39.182
SO YOU CAN'T REALLY PROMOTE A

02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:39.749
THOUSAND EVENTS AND WHAT WE

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:41.785
ENDED UP DOING IS COLLAPSING

02:42:41.852 --> 02:42:43.420
THOSE AND HAVING THE DATES AND

02:42:43.487 --> 02:42:44.387
HAVING THE LOCATIONS AND ALL

02:42:44.454 --> 02:42:45.689
HAVE HAVING ALL POSTED ON OUR

02:42:45.755 --> 02:42:46.723
WEBSITE.

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:47.858
SO THAT PEOPLE AND WE WOULD

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:49.292
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE

02:42:49.359 --> 02:42:51.061
WEBSITE TO FIND OUT WHERE THE

02:42:51.128 --> 02:42:51.928
EVENTS WERE SO THAT THEY CAN

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:52.562
SIGN UP.

02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:54.865
BUT JUST AS TO DO AN AD FOR EACH

02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:55.999
ONE OF THOSE OF THOUSANDS OF

02:42:56.066 --> 02:42:57.667
FANS WOULD BE --

02:42:57.734 --> 02:42:59.069
AND IN LOS ANGELES YOU KNOW THE

02:42:59.136 --> 02:43:01.404
EVENT IS ON THE WEST SIDE AND

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.606
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY HERE IS IT

02:43:02.672 --> 02:43:03.540
BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO DRIVE FROM

ACCOUNTABILITY THAT.

02:46:53.303 --> 02:46:54.771
MAKES IT MUCH HARDER TO GET DOWN

02:46:54.838 --> 02:46:57.974

SO MAYBE THE STATE CAN ALSO

02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:43.019
THINK OF SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:44.754

WONDERFUL JOB AT KEEPING YOU

02:48:21.925 --> 02:48:23.426
KNOW CONVERSATIONS VERY OPEN

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:25.528
WITH FOUNDATIONS I THINK WE

02:48:25.595 --> 02:48:27.330
INVITE MORE --

02:48:27.397 --> 02:48:29.098
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING.

02:48:29.165 --> 02:48:30.600
THE WAIT FOUNDATIONS ALSO

02:48:30.667 --> 02:48:32.836
PARTICIPATE ADD AS PART OF THE

02:48:32.902 --> 02:48:35.138
STATE WIDE FOUNDATIONS TABLE SO

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:36.573
THE OF PART BANDAGES COMING

02:48:36.639 --> 02:48:37.674
TOGETHER TO REALLY TALK ABOUT

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.108
THE CENSUS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:48:39.175 --> 02:48:41.478
THAT WERE CONSTANTLY DISCUSSING.

02:48:41.544 --> 02:48:44.380
IS HOW DO WE PLAN TOGETHER WITH

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:46.316
THE STATE WE DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S

02:48:46.382 --> 02:48:47.584
IT'S HARD TO MAKE FUNDING

02:48:47.650 --> 02:48:50.386
DECISIONS BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE.

02:48:50.453 --> 02:48:52.021
OUR STAKEHOLDERS THAT YOU KNOW

02:48:52.088 --> 02:48:53.523
DEMAND CERTAIN THINGS OUT OF US

02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:55.758
AND ALSO ONE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:48:55.825 --> 02:48:56.793
THAT WANT TO KNOW THAT WERE

02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:58.595
REALLY USING OR STEWARDING

02:48:58.661 --> 02:48:59.929
RESOURCES APPROPRIATELY RIGHT

02:48:59.996 --> 02:49:01.698
LOOK SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:03.066
WE CONTINUE TO GET HIT WHEN WE

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.234
TALK TO OTHER.

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.102
FOUNDATIONS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:08.705
INVEST IN THE CENSUS IS WELL WHY

02:49:08.771 --> 02:49:10.139
STEPHANIE AT LIKE THE STATE HAS

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.474
YOU KNOW RELEASED ALL THIS

02:49:11.541 --> 02:49:12.575
AMOUNT.

02:49:12.642 --> 02:49:14.844
YOU HAVE THIS AMOUNT SO WHAT'S

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:16.579
REALLY WHAT'S THE NEED --

02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:21.951
OUT THERE AND UNTIL WE KNOW AT A

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:23.386
SLOWER PACE.

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:24.988
WE JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:49:25.054 --> 02:49:26.623
SO I THINK AGAIN ONGOING

02:49:26.689 --> 02:49:28.191
CONVERSATIONS AND MORE PLANNING

02:49:28.258 --> 02:49:29.459
MEETINGS TOGETHER I THINK IT'S A

02:49:29.526 --> 02:49:31.528
WELCOME OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE HAD

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:32.996
SOME BUT I THINK.

02:49:33.062 --> 02:49:34.564
IT COULD BE THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:49:34.631 --> 02:49:36.566
ESPECIALLY AS WE START TO THINK

02:49:36.633 --> 02:49:37.667
ABOUT.

02:49:37.734 --> 02:49:39.903
YOU KNOW ETHNIC MEDIA --

02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:42.038
OUT REACHING TO THEM IN CREATING --

02:49:42.105 --> 02:49:43.973
MEDIA PARTNERSHIPS I SEE THE

02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.875
STATE'S SORT OF TAKING ON THAT

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:47.310
LEADERSHIP ROLE AND REALLY

02:49:47.377 --> 02:49:48.811
NEGOTIATING THE BIG CONTRACTS

02:49:48.878 --> 02:49:50.079
BUT ALSO PARTNERING WITH

02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:51.414
FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE ON THE

02:49:51.481 --> 02:49:52.482
GROUND AND THAT ARE THINKING

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:54.450
MORE REGIONALLY AT AT WHAT CAN

02:49:54.517 --> 02:49:56.686
WE TAKE ON LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:49:56.753 --> 02:49:58.054
RADIO IN LA.

02:49:58.121 --> 02:49:59.923
AND AN ORANGE COUNTY IS VERY

02:49:59.989 --> 02:50:02.025
IMPORTANT AND IT ACTUALLY --

02:50:02.091 --> 02:50:03.993
HAS SHOWN THAT IT HAS IT REACHES

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.628
THE AUDIENCES THAT WE WANT SO

02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:07.797
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE

02:50:07.864 --> 02:50:09.532
BIG YOU KNOW LACKEY NO NETWORK

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:11.200
THAT WE NEED --

02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:12.802
IT MIGHT BE THAT SO WHO'S GOING

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:13.903
A FEW SCHOLARSHIP BILLS LIKE THE

02:50:13.970 --> 02:50:17.640
SMALLER MEDIA STATIONS HOW DO WE

02:50:17.707 --> 02:50:19.709
PARTNER TO KNOW THAT TO IT TOO

02:50:19.776 --> 02:50:20.343
YOU KNOW COLLECTIVELY WITH THE

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:21.544
STATE TO KNOW THAT LIKE HEY YOU

02:50:21.611 --> 02:50:22.378
GUYS ARE GOING TO HANDLE THIS

02:50:22.445 --> 02:50:26.683
PIECE THIS IS WHERE PLAN TO BE.

02:50:26.749 --> 02:50:28.351
CAN COMING --

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.186
MESSAGE TESTING AND PLATFORM I

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:31.054
KNOW YOU KNOW.

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.021
FOUNDATIONS LIKE MYSELF HAVE

02:50:32.088 --> 02:50:32.622
INVESTED IN IT INCLUDING AN

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:34.390
ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN BERNARDINO

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.892
FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE THERE WERE

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:37.627
NO FUNDING PARTNERS DOING

02:50:37.694 --> 02:50:39.762
ANYTHING IN THAT REGION AND SO

02:50:39.829 --> 02:50:39.996
WE KNEW.

02:50:40.063 --> 02:50:41.431
THAT.

02:50:41.497 --> 02:50:43.333
DOING IT NOW MIGHT BE TOO LATE

02:50:43.399 --> 02:50:46.069
BECAUSE BY THE FALL EARLY NEXT

02:50:46.135 --> 02:50:46.703

WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BE READY.

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:50.673
SO --

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:52.108
THINKING ABOUT MAYBE LIKE A

02:50:52.175 --> 02:50:55.144
WEBSITE THAT --

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:56.646
MAYBE THE STATE CAN ALSO HELP US

MANAGE OR AGAIN PAY FOR WHERE

02:50:59.415 --> 02:51:00.817
NON PROFITS --

02:51:00.883 --> 02:51:01.918
OR COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS CAN

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:03.620
REALLY ACCESS THAT MESSAGING

02:51:03.686 --> 02:51:05.588
THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY VETTED IN

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:38.655
REASONS THAT YOU THINK

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:48.464
STATE THAT SHOULD PROVIDE THE

ACTUALLY. FOR MAY COMMUNITIES

02:52:04.113 --> 02:52:05.148

02:52:05.214 --> 02:52:06.315
ARE PROBABLY WRITTEN RIGHT IT'S

02:52:06.382 --> 02:52:08.084
ACTUALLY VERBAL OR SOMETHING SO

02:52:08.151 --> 02:52:08.484

FLYERS IN THAT LANGUAGE AND

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:12.088

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:21.097
FUNDING YOU HAVE.

02:52:21.164 --> 02:52:21.864
THANK YOU --

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:24.901
YES AND SO IT IS IT IS THE THE

02:52:24.967 --> 02:52:27.303
ASPECT OF DIFFERENT CULTURES AND

02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:29.272
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND

02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:31.274
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THEY

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.142
COMMUNICATE IN WHAT MESSAGING

02:52:33.209 --> 02:52:36.112
WORKS WITH ONE DOESN'T WORK --

02:52:36.179 --> 02:52:37.680
WITH ANOTHER.

02:52:37.747 --> 02:52:39.482
AND SO --

02:52:39.549 --> 02:52:40.316
THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY BASED

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:42.251
ORGANIZATIONS THEY DO KNOW HOW

02:52:42.318 --> 02:52:43.820
TO COMMUNICATE WITH FOLKS IN

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.521
THEIR COMMUNITIES --

02:52:45.588 --> 02:52:47.890
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:49.459
JEWEL CONTACTS AND IT'S GOING TO

02:52:49.525 --> 02:52:51.894
TAKE A FAR FAR BROADER.

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.963
GROUP OF OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE

02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:56.399
ABLE TO REACH OUT IN ALL OF

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:57.667
THESE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW DIVERSE

02:52:57.734 --> 02:52:59.302
WAYS YOU KNOW IT WITHIN THE

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:00.737
COMMUNITY VERSES.

02:53:00.803 --> 02:53:02.038
IF WE HAD THE SAME NUMBER THAT

02:53:02.105 --> 02:53:03.406
WERE -- THAT

02:53:03.473 --> 02:53:05.742
WAS YOU KNOW ME BEING MOSTLY YOU

02:53:05.808 --> 02:53:08.044
KNOW VIETNAMESE AND HISPANIC YOU

02:53:08.111 --> 02:53:10.747
KNOW IS IT TOO AS OPPOSED TO YOU

02:53:10.813 --> 02:53:12.215
KNOW THIRTY PLUS YOU KNOW TYPE.

02:53:12.281 --> 02:53:15.351
SO THERE'S THE THE INCREASED

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:18.721
AMOUNT IN IN BEING ABLE.

02:53:18.788 --> 02:53:19.288
TO CREATE WE HAVE TO CREATE

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:21.557
DIFFERENT MESSAGING FOR A LOT OF

02:53:21.624 --> 02:53:22.892
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND AND AND

02:53:22.959 --> 02:53:24.127
COMMUNITIES AND AND I THINK

02:53:24.193 --> 02:53:25.728
THOSE WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:27.430
ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:29.332
THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT --

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:30.900
AND THEN THE OTHER IS AND AND WE

02:53:30.967 --> 02:53:33.136
WE WE TOTALLY SUPPORT --

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:35.304
TO LANGUAGE ACCESS AND AND AND

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:36.405
MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE

02:53:36.472 --> 02:53:38.107
ACCEPTABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS OF OF

02:53:38.174 --> 02:53:39.375
ALL DIFFERENT YOU KNOW

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:42.178
DISABILITIES OR ABILITIES --

02:53:42.245 --> 02:53:45.181
AND AND SO WITH THAT IT'S NOT A

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:47.950
YOU KNOW A ONE OFF OF YOU KNOW

02:53:48.017 --> 02:53:49.085
YOU CREATE THIS AND THEN AND

02:53:49.152 --> 02:53:50.086
THEN YOU PUT IT OUT AGAIN

02:53:50.153 --> 02:53:51.587
DIFFERENT GROUPS COMMUNICATE AND

02:53:51.654 --> 02:53:53.890
AND WE'VE BEEN --

02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:54.590
YOU KNOW FOLKS HAVE GOT

02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:56.092
DIFFERENT HEARING IT LISTENING

02:53:56.159 --> 02:53:57.593
DEVICES YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE A

02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:59.061
TRANSLATOR IT'S IT'S STILL

02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:00.229
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:54:00.296 --> 02:54:01.898
BE YOU KNOW QUITE ACCURATE SO

02:54:01.964 --> 02:54:03.366
WERE OR WANTING TO HIRE

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:04.400
INDIVIDUALS FROM THIS COMMUNITY

02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:05.434
BASED ORGANIZATIONS MORE

02:54:05.501 --> 02:54:06.536
SPECIFICALLY IN THOSE

02:54:06.602 --> 02:54:07.804
COMMUNITIES.

02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:09.138
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAN TALK

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:10.640
WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS AND SO THEY

02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:11.941
THEY SEE THAT HIGH SCHOOL

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:14.310
STUDENT OR OR COLLEGE STUDENT

02:54:14.377 --> 02:54:14.911
THAT'S BEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY

02:54:14.977 --> 02:54:15.978
AND NOW.

02:54:16.045 --> 02:54:17.113
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALSO SHOWING UP

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:18.281
A COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT'S PART

02:54:18.347 --> 02:54:19.482
OF THE COMMUNITY BUILDING YOU

02:54:19.549 --> 02:54:21.317
KNOW THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:24.887
ACHIEVE WITH THE THROUGH THIS --

02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:26.989
THE STATE WIDE BASIS IS TWO ONE

02:54:27.056 --> 02:54:28.191
ONE AND THEY OFFER TRANSLATION

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.525
SERVICES AND THAT'S SOMETHING

02:54:29.592 --> 02:54:30.793
THAT'S OFFERED.

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.161
ACROSS THE STATE --

02:54:32.228 --> 02:54:34.030
AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO GROW

02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:37.533
THAT CAPACITY I THROUGHPUT YOU

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:38.534
KNOW POTENTIALLY A STATE

02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:40.536
CONTRACT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

02:54:40.603 --> 02:54:42.171
YOU KNOW CALL 211- AND YOU NEED

02:54:42.238 --> 02:54:43.806
A TRANSLATOR SOMEBODY STILL HAS

02:54:43.873 --> 02:54:45.341
TO PAY THAT COST AND SO THAT'S

02:54:45.408 --> 02:54:46.509
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S FACTORED

02:54:46.576 --> 02:54:48.244
INTO OUR BUDGET --

02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:50.446
YOU KNOW WE ARE BUILDING A

02:54:50.513 --> 02:54:52.248
WEBSITE FOR THE COUNTY AND FOR A

02:54:52.315 --> 02:54:53.716
RESIDENTS BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:54:53.783 --> 02:54:55.017
BE IN SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

02:54:55.084 --> 02:54:56.385
ARE MAINTAINED IN SIX DIFFERENT

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:57.353
LANGUAGES.

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:58.988
IT SHOULD BE --

02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:00.189
BUT AGAIN IT TAKES ADDITIONAL

02:55:00.256 --> 02:55:02.158
FUNDING TO TO TO DO THAT TYPE OF

02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:02.992
THING.

02:55:03.059 --> 02:55:04.527
SO YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:07.330
IT'S IT'S IT'S THE DIVERSE THE

02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:09.765
NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:55:09.832 --> 02:55:12.235
OF OF CULTURES AND LANGUAGES.

02:55:12.301 --> 02:55:14.170
THAT THEN JUST MAKES REPLICATION

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:16.305
OF OF ALL OUT REACH A LITTLE BIT

02:55:16.372 --> 02:55:20.142
MORE COSTLY MUCH NEEDED YOU KNOW

02:55:20.209 --> 02:55:23.646
BUT THAT ADDS TO THE COST.

02:55:23.713 --> 02:55:24.647
SO I WOULD YEAH.

02:55:24.714 --> 02:55:26.949
I WOULD ADD ONE THING TO YOUR

02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:28.684
CONVERSATION --

02:55:28.751 --> 02:55:29.285
I THINK THAT THERE'S IN SOME

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:30.253
WAYS A BENEFIT FOR THE STATE TO

02:55:30.319 --> 02:55:31.454
DO A LOT OF THE TRANSLATING.

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.122
SPEAK ADD MAKING I UNIVERSAL OR

02:55:33.189 --> 02:55:34.891
EVERGREEN PIECES SO THAT PEOPLE

02:55:34.957 --> 02:55:36.759
COULD MAYBE PUT THERE ARE LIKE

02:55:36.826 --> 02:55:39.729
STAMP.

02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:42.665
PRINTED TO PERSONALIZE IT --

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:45.568
BECAUSE THE THINK OF A TERRACE

02:55:45.635 --> 02:55:47.303
AND I HAVE A PERSONAL PREJUDICE

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:48.738
ABOUT TRANSLATING.

02:55:48.804 --> 02:55:50.206
BOB EVERY DOCUMENT EVER WRITTEN

02:55:50.273 --> 02:55:51.707
THAT ISN'T PUBLICLY RELEASED I

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:52.975
HAD AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE READ IT

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:54.377
AFTER I WROTE IT TO MAKE SURE

02:55:54.443 --> 02:55:55.011
WAS RIGHT.

02:55:55.077 --> 02:55:56.913
AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES BUT

02:55:56.979 --> 02:55:58.381
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE WITH

02:55:58.447 --> 02:56:00.049
TRANSLATIONS WERE PEOPLE ASSUME

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:01.284
BECAUSE A PERSON SPEAKS

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.452
VIETNAMESE THEY ARE TRANSLATING

02:56:03.519 --> 02:56:04.954
IT PERFECTLY.

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.555
AND IT JUST AS YOU WOULD DO IT

02:56:06.622 --> 02:56:07.723
IN ENGLISH AND YOU WOULD HAVE

02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:09.158
MULTIPLE PEOPLE REVIEW IT YOU

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:10.126
NEED TO HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE

02:56:10.192 --> 02:56:11.494

02:56:12.662 --> 02:56:13.829
TRANSLATION.

02:56:13.896 --> 02:56:15.531
AND SO THAT'S I THINK A JOB IS

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:16.699
EASIER THAN IN THE STATE WIDE

02:56:16.766 --> 02:56:18.367
