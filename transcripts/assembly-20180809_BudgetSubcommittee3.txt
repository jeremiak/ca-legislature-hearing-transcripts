OF THE OXIDE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUPS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE PLEAS OF THIS COMMUNITY AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MIGUEL SANTIAGO IN PRISTINA GARCIA. OUR COMMITTEE TOOK AN ACTION TO SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL TO CLEAN UP THE CONTAMINATION FROM BACKSIDE. AND THEN JUST THIS PAST YEAR WE ALSO SECURED AN ADDITIONAL SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR CLEANUP WORK OF PARK WAYS. THAT WERE FOR REASONS OTHER COMPLEX AND STILL UNCLEAR TO SOME OF US. WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE INITIAL CLEANUP ORDER BUT THE MONEY IS THERE NOW TO BEGIN NOW WORK. THIS COMMITTEE HAS A DUTY TO OVERSEE STATE ENTITIES AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES. THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE CLEAN UP EFFORT THAT'S LED BY DTS SEE AS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. AS I KNOW YOU ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT HERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. OF IT IS IN FACT CONSIDERED THE LARGEST EVER CLEAN UP OF LEAD CONTAMINATED HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH ANY PROJECT AT THIS SCALE -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT OTHER -- ARE LIKELY TO BE INEVITABLE SETBACKS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THIS PROJECT AND I'M. HOPING THIS HEARING TODAY WILL PROVIDE US WITH A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE WITH THE CLEAN UP. OF WHAT SOME OF THOSE SETBACKS HAVE BEEN HOW TO OVERCOME THEM. THEM IN THE FUTURE AND WHERE WE PROCEED FROM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND A MINUTE I'M GOING TO TURN TO THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY MY COLLEAGUE ANTHONY RENDON AS WELL AS MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WHO WERE IN ATTENDANCE TODAY. HOWEVER I AGAIN WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE COMMITMENT TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY HERE THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS. MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE WATER CRISIS IN FLINT MICHIGAN A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE. ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT CRISIS WHERE THE ENTIRE CITY WAS EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF LEAD IN THEIR DRINKING WATER. THE INCIDENTS BECAME A NATIONAL HEADLINE AND HIGHLIGHTED UNFORTUNATELY GOVERNMENT AT ITS WORST. AND WHY WAS IT IS AT ITS WORST BECAUSE IT REALLY FAILED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE. OF THE EXIDE BATTERY PLANTS IS -- THIS COMMUNITIES FLICK MICHIGAN. FOR DECADES THE OWNERS OF THIS PLANT AND OUR GOVERNMENT. FAILED TO PROTECT THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMUNITY. BUT JUST TO THIS COMMITTEE AS THIS COMMITTEE IS WORKING TO PROVIDE. CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO A SMALL RURAL AND POOR COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO DANGERS LET DANGEROUS LEVELS OF NITRATES CHROMIUM SIX IN LAD. JUST AS THIS COMMITTEE IS WORKING TO INVEST HEAVILY IN PREVENTING FIRES THAT HAVE RAVAGED COMMUNITIES IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR COMMUNITY GETS CLEANED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND THAT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN ARE SAFE. NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. SITTING UP HERE ON THIS DIES WITH ME OR SOME OF THE MOST COMMITTED ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE STATE. COMMITTED TO PROTECTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND FIGHTING FOR THOSE IN NEED THESE PEOPLE HAVE LIVED THERE. AND THEY HAVE FOUGHT JUST AS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER -- THEY'RE HERE TO LISTEN AND TO HEAR YOU CLOSELY AND TO HEAR THOSE WHO ARE PRESENTING -- AND PROVIDING US WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE PROVIDED THIS EVENING AND WITH THAT I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. MISTER ANTHONY RENDON THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE CHAIR NOT ONLY FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING FOR BUT FOR HIS LONG LONG TIME COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HE IS -- CONTINUALLY ASKED ME ABOUT CONTINUALLY BEEN ENGAGED ON TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES -- THAT CHRISTINA GARCIA AND MISTER SANTIAGO BOTH OF WHOM. REPRESENT PARTS OF THE AFFECTED AREA THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN -- HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING AS WELL -- WINDY CAREER WHO JOINED THE ASSEMBLY EARLIER THIS YEAR HAS JUMPED IN RIGHT AWAY ONE OF OUR EARLY DISCUSSIONS. SHE ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I ALSO WANT TO THANK A SUPERVISOR HELD THE SAUDIS WHO HAS. BEEN. WHO ALSO HAS BEEN ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE MULTIPLE VISITS TO SACRAMENTO TO TO TALK TO ME AND MY STAFF ABOUT THIS SHE AND HER STAFF? HAVE BEEN QUITE ENGAGED AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR FOR FOR CARRYING THIS WORK FORWARD FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S SAD THAT WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR SO LONG AND I BELIEVE THAT MS GARCIA AND I SAT IN A HEARING IN THE CITY OF COMMERCE OUR FRESHMAN YEAR THAT -- THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR OUR FRESHMAN TERM -- AND AS I SAID ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR TWO YEARS AGO. EXCITED PUT IT POLLUTANTS IN FOR DECADES AND IT'S THEIR JOB. AND OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT IT'S CLEANED. I ARGUED THEN ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE STATE HAS TO ADVANCE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR CLEAN UP. AS MISTER BLOOM MENTIONED THERE'VE BEEN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT SINCE THAT TIME. EXCITES TOXIC LEAD EMISSIONS ARE SPECIALLY HARMFUL TO CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. AND I HEAR THAT THERE'S NEW EVIDENCE FROM USC OUR FRIENDS IN EAST YARDS AND COUNTY RESEARCH THAT LED IS PASSED ON TO PREGNANT MOTHERS TO THE BABY EVEN. BEFORE IT IS BORN. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REMEDIATE THE LEAD POLLUTION CAUSED BY EXCITED NOW. WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER LEAD EXPOSURE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE NEED TO DO THAT NOW AS WELL. AS WE ALL KNOW WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER THE KIDS CAN'T WAIT FOR LIABILITY CLAIMS TO DRAG THROUGH THE COURTS. SO THE COMMUNITY IS FINALLY SEEING RESIDENTIAL ENOUGH PROCEEDING ON A LARGER SCALE UNDER DGSE. IT'S APPROPRIATE NOW TO LOOK AT A FEW THINGS NUMBER ONE WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT LET EXCITE OFF THE HOOK FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY ENGENDERED. SECOND WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HOW THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP GOES AND DISCUSS HOW PARK WAYS WILL BE TESTED AND CLEANED UP. FINALLY THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE WHETHER OUR NEXT APPS WHAT'S THE FIRST TWO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP. THE DEPARTMENT THE COUNTY OFFICIALS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IN A HEALTHY DIRECTION. AND AT A FAST PACE. THE PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH THERE CAN'T BE ANY MORE DELAYS. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU AROUND AND UNFORTUNATELY SPEAKER AND IT HAS A EXTREMELY BUSY AND A CONGESTED.

FOR OUR DISTRICT AND THAT BECOMES A PRIORITY EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PERCENT AND WE WORK FOR THE WHOLE STATE -- BUT IT IS SPECIAL WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN THIS COMMITTED TO THE ISSUE. SO I THINK YOURSELF AND YOUR STAFF WHO ALSO HAVE BEEN I INSTRUMENTALIST AND THIS WORK. AND ARE MY PEERS AS WELL OVER HERE WHO HAVE ALL BEEN CHAMPIONS AND THIS ISSUE. LIKE THE SPEAKER SAID WE'VE HAD MULTIPLEHEARINGS AND HER FIRST ONE WITH ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO -- AND YOU KNOW THE FRUSTRATION IS CLEAR IN THE COMMUNITY AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE IT'S A DOG AND PONY SHOW AND AND ARE WE REALLY GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS THING WE'VE SEEN SOME. SOME IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY RAY PARK WITH THATTHAN SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ADVOCATING. FOR AND WE SAW SOME MOTION AND THAT FINALLY IN THIS BUDGET -- WHEN I THINK ABOUT? THE REQUEST THIS SEEMS PRETTY PRAGMATIC AND AND SOMETIMES I ASK MYSELF WHY IT WAS SO HARD TO GET THAT ONE ITEM TAKEN CARE OF I HOPE THAT WE REALIZE THIS IS ONE OF MANY ITEMS THAT WE NEED TO DO. INCLUDE AS WE HAD JUST BEEN WE LEARN FROM THIS TIME. ALONG THE WAY I THINK FOR MYSELF I DON'T EXPECT. AFFECTION BUT I I DO EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING WE'RE LEARNING AND WHERE JUSTIN AT A AT A MUCH. QUICKER RATE OUT THERE ONLY TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK THE COMMUNITY AND THE ACTIVISTS IN THE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN. A VOICE LONG BEFORE I JOINED DESPITE. YOU HAD FOLKS LIKE MOTHERS EVERY SALLY EAST YARD CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS. THE RESURRECTION CHURCH WHO IS ALSO HERE HEALTHINESS TODAY BUT ONO AND NUMEROUS OTHER GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE PROVIDE AN AND NO ONE'S LEFT BEHIND. THERE'S A BIG FEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN UP HE'S BEHIND WE KNOW THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS LEAVES COMMUNITIES BEHIND. THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE DON'T DO THAT AND AND A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE HELP OF LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES IN OUR SPEAKER. WE PASS A BATTERY FEE BILL TO HELP INSURE SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS THEIR I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE FROM THIS ISSUE TO ENSURE THE FLYERS ARE LEFT THERE FOR CLEAN UP AND AND NOT FOR OTHER. THINGS ALONG THE WAY. FOR THE COMMUNITY. I WANT TO SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION WHEN I SEE THE PLAN THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER FIVE YEARS AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN UP THE JUST THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BONES. I WORRY ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT CONTENIDO IN THOSE HOMES WE THOUGHT THAT WE ARE AT A WOMAN FELT HER NAME IS ANGIE SHE WAS MY CONSTITUENTS. USUALLY HAPPY THAT HER YARD HAD FINALLY BEEN CLEANED UP. I ASKED HER HOW THE PROCESS WORKS AND SHE SAID WELL I FOUND OUT OVER TWO YEARS AGO. THAT I HAD OVER ONE THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION AND HOT TOPIC THAT WAS. IN FOR TWO YEARS ACTUALLY DID KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON I HAD TO DO SOME FOLLOW UP AND I JUST HAPPENSTANCE WRITING TO SOMEONE THAT WAS ABLE TO HELP ME TO FIGURE THAT OUT. IN ITS CLEAN NOW AND I ASKED HER FOR TWO YEARS HAVE YOU HAD YOUR DOORS CLOSED IN YOUR WINDOWS CLOSED IN THE STATE INCITING YOU MAKE SURE THE DOGS ARE TRACKING ANYTHING IN AND YOUR KIDS AND YOUR GRANDKIDS ARE LIKE IN THEIR SHOES IN YOUR TESTING EVERY DAY. AND SHE WAS LIKE OF COURSE NOT THAT'S NOT FEASIBLE OTHER FAMILY SERBIAN SOLDIERS CLOSE YOUR DOORS JUST CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS. IN THIS HEAT ON ANYTHING -- IN KEEP WAITING KEEP WAITING TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS WHATEVER IS GOING TO TAKE AND I START THINKING MAYBE WHEN YOU START THINKING OF SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES MAYBE WE NEED TO START MOVING SOME PEOPLE OUT WHILE WE DO THIS IF THIS IS. THE REALITY OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER. ALL AND SO I WORRY ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS ON ON THESE COMMUNITIES AND WHILE ANGIE WAS HAPPY THAT WE CLEAN THE PER YARD AND SHE FELT SATISFIED. AS ALSO MAKES ME SAD THAT SOME SAY THE COMMUNITY WHO HAS LEFT BEHIND HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND WHO HAS BEEN TREATED LIKE A WASTELAND. THIS CONTEST YOU IN THREE LIKE WITH DISPOSABLE. ARE GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH A LITTLE WHEN WE KNOW THAT THE REALITY THAT DESERVE A LOT MORE. I AM CONFIDENT IN THE TALENT BETWEEN THE STATE THE COUNTY THE CITY SAID THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE CAN DO IT BETTER I AM EXCITED THAT WE DO HAVE SOME AMAZING COLLEAGUES. A C. HAVE A PEER WHO HAD BEEN CHAMPIONS -- AND AND OUR COFFEE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO TO CONTINUE WORKING VERY APPRECIATIVE OF OUR SPEAKER -- AND OUR CHAIRMAN MISTER SOMEDAY ONE MISSED GOTTA GO FOR THE ADVOCACY THAT THEY DO ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE WE DO IT TOGETHER. THANK YOU. PLEASE CARRY ON THANK YOU. A GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE UP HERE WITH CHAMPIONS OF IN MY FAMILY JUSTICE TONIGHT I WISH THAT IT WERE BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAYBE PERHAPS FOR MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME AS I AM. RECENTLY ELECTED INTO THIS ROLE THE EXIDE BATTERY CLEAN UP IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO JUMP IN THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE GROWN UP IN THAT I LIVE IN I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT LIVE HERE. AND EVEN IF I DIDN'T I'D STILL BE FIGHTING BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT'S ONE OF THE WORST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN. AND YET. THE VERY PEOPLE VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE THAT MADE TONIGHT POSSIBLE INCLUDING RESURRECTION RESURRECTION CHURCH FOR OPENING ITS DOORS AND ALLOWING THIS FACE. AND THIS DIALOGUE TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY HAS EXPOSED FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF LEAD. WE KNOW THAT EVEN A SMALL PERCENTAGE SON OF LETTUCE DANGEROUS SO THE LEVELS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. THEIR HORRIFIC FOR THIS COMMUNITY IF YOU THINK ABOUT CHILDREN PREGNANT MOTHERS OR PREGNANT WOMEN X. SOON TO BE EXPECTING. AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION IDENTIFIED LED TO BE THE POTENT. NEUROTOXIN WITH NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE. THAT IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE KNOWS KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE LEARNING PROBLEMS AND EVEN SLOW PHYSICAL GROWTH IN YOUNG CHILDREN. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE CLEAN UP THIS HAZARDOUS THIS HAZARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE NEGLIGENCE THAT HAS BEEN. PREVAILING IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS FOR QUITE TOO LONG BEEN DISENFRANCHISED. IS CRIMINAL AND SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND NOW THAT WE ARE. NOW WE HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG. IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED THE HOMES THE PARKWAYS THE GRASS THE SOIL THE SIDEWALKS HAVE ALSO LARGELY BEEN NEGLECTED. I WAS TOLD WHEN I FIRST. GOT INTO OFFICE AND STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT EXCITED THAT EVERYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE. SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF WHAT IT TRULY MEANS TO LOOK AT THIS AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL -- HARM TO THIS COMMUNITY AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF LEVELS HAVE SAFETY AND DIGNITY AND PROSPEROUS HEALTHY LIVES IN THIS COMMUNITY. WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT EXIDE OVER LOOKING AT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAS IMPACTED THIS COMMUNITY COMMUNITY FOR FAR TOO LONG. THE UNFORTUNATE MINIMAL PROGRESS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TALK TALK THAT SUBSTANTIAL. THAT HAS BEEN MADE WITH THIS CLEAN UP IS REALLY QUITE FRANKLY UNACCEPTABLE IF THIS COMMUNITY LOOKED ANY DIFFERENT. THAN THE COMMUNITY THAT LIVES HERE. I CAN ALMOST GUESS THAT THAT CLEAN UP WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MUCH FASTER. AND THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. DISCOURSE IS IMPORTANT OVER THE BRIEF TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO LISTENING. LEARNING ESPECIALLY ON THIS ISSUE I HAVE ALSO SPOKEN TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. LEADING THE CHARGE OF THIS CLEAN UP AND I WANT TO THANK FATHER JOHN READ UP FOR LEADING THAT CHARGE HIM FOR OPENING UP SPACE BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS CAN DO. IS LISTEN TO THE CONSTITUENTS LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE ACTUALLY REPRESENT. AND HOPEFULLY DO THE RIGHT THING AND DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE HEALTHY LIVES. DR JILL JOHNSON IS ALSO A LEADER THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SEEKING ANSWERS OF BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY HER STUDIES. HAVE FOUND TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT EXIDE -- HAS PREVAILED IN THIS COMMUNITY. I AM DETERMINED -- WITH THE COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES STATE LEADERS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE BEING USED IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MISS GARCIA'S POINT TODAY WE DID MEET WITH RIGHT WHETHER WHAT WITH THE PRESIDENT TODAY. WE ALSO MET WITH WORKERS. SOME OF WHOM HAVE STUDIED UNDER LABORERS LOCAL THREE HUNDRED SOME HAVE. JOIN THE UNION FOR THIS WORK SOME HAVE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS WORK IS BEING DONE TO A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT MOVING FORWARD THESE WORKERS. ARE ACTUALLY USING THE SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO THIS WORK IT'S CONCERNING TO ME. THAT A PROJECT THAT HAS HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD. IS BEING DONE. WITHOUT THE PROTECTION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE DOING THIS WORK. ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ANY ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS TO THEMSELVES. SO I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN IN LEARNING ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND LEARNING TO ENSURE THAT THE THE WORKERS WHO ARE DOING THIS CLEAN UP. ARE ALSO OF FOLLOWING THE SAFETY STANDARDS THAT THEY NEED SO THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT CANCER LEVEL RATES. ARE BASED ON THE PEOPLE THAT DID THIS WORK SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM POINT A TO POINT C. AND EVERYBODY THAT'S INCLUDED IN BETWEEN. SO AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR COMING HERE I THINK ON THE THE CHAIRMAN FOR PUTTING THIS. THIS HEARING TOGETHER AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. AND FINALLY WE GO FROM HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR BRING IN THIS -- COMMITTEE HEARING HERE IT'S IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POINT ONE MISTER SPEAKER WITHOUT DOUBT UP YOUR LEADERSHIP IN HELPING US TO SHEPHERD -- THE DOLLARS TO MAKE THIS CLEAN UP AVAILABLE TO US AND BOTH MY COLLEAGUES MISS CORREO AND MISS GARCIA FOR CHAMPION IN THIS ISSUE -- YEAR AFTER YEAR UP BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT THIS COMMUNITY -- WHO HAS SUFFERED FOR OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS OF WHAT'S NOW KNOWN AS THE WORST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER ON THE WEST COAST? AND LET'S CALL FOR IT IS. ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN ANYWHERE ELSE. IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED ANYWHERE ELSE. AND WE WE HAVE NOW FOX. NOT ONLY TO STOP IT. BUT WE NOW FIGHTING TO CONTINUE TO CLEAN IT UP. AND WE OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO EACH AND EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY MEMBER WHO HAS BEEN HERE. YEAR AFTER YEAR MEETING AFTER MEETING. TOILING CAN TO CONTINUE IN THE FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS CLEANED UP.

WHO HAS BEEN THAT ONE CHAMPION OVER AND OVER AND OVER IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THERE'S BEEN AN INJUSTICE DONE?

WHERE THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE RESIDENTS HAVE GRANTED US ACCESS TO CONDUCT OUR SAMPLING? TO DATES THE TEARS HE HAS COLLECTED SOIL SAMPLES FROM OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PARCELS AND CONTINUES TO TAKE SAMPLES HAS ADDITIONAL ACCESSES FOR SAMPLING IS GRANTED TO US. THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PARCELS HOWEVER THAT WITHIN THE PIAA THAT ACCESS FOR SAMPLING HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED. DESPITE OF MORETHAN SEVEN TIMES ATTEMPTS FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES TO GAIN ACCESS. THE TSA HAS REVIEWED VERIFIED AND ANALYZE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DATA POINTS FROM THE SAMPLES THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED. AND PROVIDED. THAT INFORMATION TO ALLOW US TO I OR TIES CLEAN UP FOR THESE PROPERTIES. SAMPLING DATA HAS BEEN SHARED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND RESIDENTS AND INPUT ON IT THE TSC WEBSITES WITH AN INTERACTIVE MAP THAT ALLOWS. THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OTHERS TO REVIEW THE PARCEL SPECIFIC DATA AND SAMPLING RESULTS. I USING THIS ALL SAMPLE RESULTS AS OF EARLY THIS WEEK THE TSC IS CLEANED UP OVER THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PARCELLS AND CONTINUES TO CLEAN UP PROPERTIES. UNDER TO APPROVE CLEANUP PLAN AND CLEAN UP CONTRACTS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE CLEAN UPS CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED DTS HE HAS CONDUCTED CLEANUP PLANNING MEETINGS AND SCHEDULING DISCUSSIONS. WITH RESIDENTS AND HAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PARTS THERE'S ACTUALLY LINED UP FOR CLEANUP WORK. THIS PROVIDES GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR DTS SEAT. CLUSTER CLEANUPS IN AN AREA AND BETTER SCHEDULING YOU KNOW TO MAKE THE CLEANUPS MORE EFFICIENT. USING THE EXPERIENCE DTCS GAIN FROM THESE CLEANUPS. ARE WE HAVE AS OF THIS WEEK OVER THIRTEEN CRUISE OUT IN THE FIELD. WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING THEIR RATE OF OUR CLEANUPS AT PRESENTLY WE SCHEDULE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PARCELS PER WEEK. AND THIS IS INCREASED FROM JULY WHERE WE WERE SCHEDULING TEN TO TWELVE AND JUNE. FIVE TO TEN WHEN WE HAD -- OUR NEW CONTRACT. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE THAT CLEAN UP AND ENTER UP ON INTERRUPTED AND TO INCREASE THE CLEAN OPERATE. CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP FOR THE PRIORITIZE PROPERTY. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CONTRACT PERFORMANCE IN RESPOSE TO SOME OF THE SITE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND COMMUNITY INPUT. BESIDES THE HAZARDOUS WASTE OPERATOR TRAINING OR HAS WHOPPER AND OTHER TRAININGS WE HAVE EXPANDED CONTRACTOR TRAINING TO INCLUDE LET CERTIFICATION EVEN THOUGH THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. BUT ALSO WE HAVE PROVIDED -- CULTURAL SENSITIVITY TRAINING AND PROJECT SPECIFIC TRAINING. AND A RAMP UP PERIOD ALLOWS US TO WORK OUT THE LOGISTICS OF INCREASING THE RATE OF CLEAN UP -- WHILE WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SPECIALIZED OVERSIGHT FOR USING OUR SCIENTISTS GEOLOGISTS AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST. ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH FIELD% OBSERVATION AN ON SITE TRAINING AND FEEDBACK. THE TSA HAS ALTERED OUR CLEANUP PREPARATION PROCESS TO START EARLY AND REDUCE COSTS. AT THE INITIAL MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENCY TO SEE VERIFIES FIND ACCESS AGREEMENTS THAT. ARE IN PLACE AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL -- SITE SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND PROFILE. THIS ALLOWS US TO TIMELY PROCESS THE INFORMATION AND BE READY FOR COMPLETE CLEANUPS MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY AND SAVES COSTS THE TEARS SEAT STREAMLINE THE LANDSCAPING SELECTION IMPLEMENTATION. TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY PROPERTY OWNERS REVIEWS AND SIGNS THE RESTORATION PLAN AHEAD OF TIME. AND PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO GET THE MATERIAL -- IN PLACE EARLIER HAD AS A THE TSA IS CURRENTLY ENCOURAGING INTERIOR CLEANING. WE HEARD ABOUT THAT THROUGHOUT OUR TOUR JUST TODAY EVERY RESIDENT IS OFFERED PROFESSIONAL INTERIOR CLEANING SERVICES AS OF EARLY THIS WEEK OVERALL. ABOUT EIGHTY NINE OR 25% OF THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PROPERTIES CLEANED HAD -- EXCEPT THAT INTERIOR CLEANING BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT OVERALL RATE. IS INCREASING IN RECENT MONTHS AND WE'RE SAYING THAT APPROACHING ALMOST FORTY OR 50%. DTS IMPROVED INTERIOR CLEANING PROCESS IN RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY INPUT. RESIDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR EARLY PROCESS AND WE CHANGED OUR SYSTEM -- THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE CHANGED OUR VOUCHER -- COUPON SYSTEM WHERE WE USED TO PROVIDE THAT TO DICK RESIDENT AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT A CLEANING SERVICES DIRECTLY -- WE ARE NOW PROVIDING THAT UP FRONT THROUGH OUR OWN SUBCONTRACTOR AND ARRANGE FOR THAT AHEAD OF TIME. DTS IS ALSO EXPANDED THE WORK FORCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION IN COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES OR WORK PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDED TRAINING FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS TO SAFELY PERFORM SAMPLING AND CLEANUP WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND SUPPORT SKILL BUILDING AND CERTIFICATION FOR LONG TERM CARE YEARS ENVIRONMENTAL FIELDS. DTS HE HAS NOW EXPANDED THIS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE SOIL REMOVAL RESTORATION AND LANDSCAPING. WE'RE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION COURTS TO PROVIDE SIGHT RESTORATION OF SELECTED PROPERTIES. AND ESTABLISHED A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER AND TARGETED LOCAL HIRING REQUIREMENTS WHICH ALSO PROVIDES A PAT THE UNION MEMBERSHIP FOR INTERESTED WORK GRADUATES. AND CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR TRAINING SIR. AS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE'VE EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE HAVE DIVIDED THAT PREVENT ANY INVESTIGATION AREA INTO SEVEN OUTREACH ZONES. WITH DEDICATED BILINGUAL POINT OF CONTACT FOR EACH OUT TREATS ON BESIDES THE REGULAR TECHNICAL ADVISORY -- EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES ISER GROUP MEETINGS THE TEARS HE HAS CONDUCTED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PUBLIC MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS IN THIS COMMUNITY. INCLUDING SPANISH TRANSLATION FOR EACH MEETING WE'VE ALSO HELD SPANISH LANGUAGE ONLY MEETING. READING YOUR SAMPLING RESULTS WORKSHOPS OTHER OTHER MEETINGS WITH. PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OTHER LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION WE PARTICIPATE IN NUMEROUS SMALL COMMUNITY MEETINGS SUCH AS THE ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY HELD HERE EVERY MONDAY AT THE RESURRECTION CHURCH. AND THE MONTHLY MAY WITH COMMUNITY MEETING. AS PART OF OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE HAVE ALSO SENT OUT MORE THAN TWENTY DIFFERENT MAILERS TO ANNOUNCE MEETINGS AVAILABLE YET DOCUMENTS AND REVIEW. COMMENTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND UPDATES WE USE ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND A DAY ADDRESSES IN OUR MAILING THESE -- FOR THESE MAIL OUTS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A PROJECT HOTLINE THAT HAS FIELDED OVER ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALLS TO THE HOTLINE. AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE OUR SAMPLING RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE TO PROVIDE. A SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR EACH PROPERTY. WE'VE ALSO ACTIVELY COORDINATED WITH ALL LOCAL JURISDICTION WITH A BI WEEKLY CALL THAT INCLUDES IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTION ALTHOUGH ALSO STAFF REPRESENTING ELECTED OFFICIALS. SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALSO WE HAVE COORDINATED WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AS YOU HEARD FROM -- COUNCILMEMBER WAYS ARE FOR THEIR SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPING PROGRAM AND WE'RE WORKING ON A LEAD BASED PAINT AND PROGRAMS AS WELL. IN ADDITION THE TSA HAS COORDINATED WITH OUR CONTRACTOR AND ALL AL SOME OF THE JURISDICTIONS HAVE MODIFIED THEIR PROCESSES TO ISSUING KREUTZMANN AND GRADING PERMITS. IN ONE DAY AT NO COST OF PROVIDING OTHER OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE CITY OF COMMERCE ISSUES PERMITS SAME DAY AT NO COST. CITIES OF BELLE HUNTINGTON PARK AND MAY WOULD ISSUE PERMITS SAME DAY AND ALLOW BATCH PERMITS TO BE ISSUED. THE THE PARKWAYS I KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND I WOULD LIKE TO JUST PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF UPDATE ON THE PARK WAYS AS WELL. AS YOU ALL KNOW SP EIGHT FORTY WAS SIGNED AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET PACKED AND PROVIDED. SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING FOR SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP A PARK WAYS IN THE AREAS OF FORMER EXCITE FACILITY. HAS THE EIGHT FORTY REQUIRES THE TSC TO SAMPLE AS MANY PARKWAYS AS FEASIBLE ADJACENT TO THE PROPERTY IS PRIORITIZED FOR CLEAN UP. UNDER DTS IS CLEAN UP PLAN AND TO CLEAN UP PART WAYS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD. IN THE GREATEST RISK OF EXPOSURE IN THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AREA. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THESE ARE THE STEPS NECESSARY FOR DETAILS SEE TO SAMPLE AND CLEANUP PARKWAYS. WE NEED TO HIRE A SAMPLING CONTRACTOR AND DEVELOP A SAMPLING PLAN. CONTRACTOR WILL THEN PERFORMED A SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS BASED ON A SAMPLING RESULTS AND RISK ASSESSMENT DTS HE WILL DEVELOP A CLEANUP PLAN. AND ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. TO DETERMINE WHICH PARKWAYS REQUIRED CLEAN OUT THE KNEE TSC WILL PROCURE A CLEANUP CONTRACTOR TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. HERE IS A ROUGH TIME LINE TO PERFORM THE SAMPLING WORK FOR THE PARKWAY. STARTING THIS MONTH WE'VE ACTUALLY BEGAN DEVELOPMENT OF A SCOPE OF WORK FOR SAMPLING. HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE PROCURE A SAMPLING CONTRACTOR AND BEGIN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL JURISDICTION RELATIVE TO THE PARKWAY? IN FALL THE TEARS HE WILL WORK WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO DEVELOP THE SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS PLAN. DEVELOP A SAMPLING SCHEDULE AND SECURE ANY NECESSARY PERMITS FROM LOCAL JURISDICTION AND WE BEGIN THE SAMPLING WORK IN JANUARY. IN SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP THE PARK WHICH IS THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT THE TSC NEEDS TO CONSIDER -- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FREQUENCY AND RISK ASSOCIATED WITH DEPARTMENT. THEN THERE ARE SOME ISSUES RELATIVE TO THE WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE PARKWAYS HAVE. GREATER -- UTILITIES. UTILITIES AND WORKERS HAVE TO ACTUALLY WORK CLOSER TO ST SO THEY'LL BE IN THE ROADWAYS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH EACH JURISDICTION SINCE THE OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PARKWAYS AS WELL AS PERMIT REQUIREMENTS DIFFER. FROM EACH JURISDICTION. THIS TABLE IS JUST A SUMMARY OF THE INFORMATION DTS IS ESTABLISHED BY CONTACTING YOUR JURISDICTION. A TO DETERMINE OWNERSHIP MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY AND PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AS SHOWN IN THIS TABLE ALMOST ALL PARKWAYS ARE OWNED BY THE CITY OR COUNTY. BUT AS THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PARKWAY IN SOME CASES IS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OWNERS -- SUCH AS CITIES OF BELLE HUNTINGTON PARK IN LOS ANGELES. WHEREAS N OTHERS -- MAINTENANCE FOR BETWEEN THE OWNER AND JURISDICTION SUCH AS MAY WITHIN THE COUNTY. ALSO THE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS VARY FROM EACH JURISDICTION AS SHOWN IN THIS TABLE. THE TSA WILL PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES TO THE COMMUNITY AND AFTER COMPLETION OF SAMPLING OF THE PARKWAYS TEDIOUS HE WILL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC REGARDING. PARKWAY SAMPLING STATUS PARTLY CLEANUP PLAN DEVELOPMENT THAT. AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE PARKWAY. SO IN CONCLUSION I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT DTS IS PRIORITY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CLEANUP WORK CONTINUES EXPEDITIOUSLY AND WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. CLEANING -- ARE CONDUCTED IN A MANNER THAT IS SAFE AND EFFICIENT AND PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND FINALLY THE PROGRESS THAT THE CLEANUP IS READILY AVAILABLE IN A CLEAR TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE WAY. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU THANK YOU DIRECTLY. YEAH AFTER DIRECTOR LEE IS SO COMPLETE YOUR REMARKS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AS WELL AS AT FATHER JOHN AND TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN UP. TO HEAR ABOUT OUR PROGRESS. RESTORING THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE RELEASES FROM THE EXCITED FACILITY. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS WITH YOU. THE ACTIONS DTS HE IS TAKING. TO ENSURE THAT ONLY DOES THIS CLEAN UP HAPPEN BUT THAT WE ADDRESS THE LARGER COMMUNITY ISSUES FOR ALL OF THE CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THE YEARS OF OPERATION AT THE EXACT SITE. DTS HE IS ACTIVELY WORKING TO HOLD EXCITED ACCOUNTABLE AND TO MAKE SURE THE ACTIONS IT'S TAKING NOW. ARE SAFE. WE HAVE THREE IMPORTANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO DO THIS. WE'RE OVERSEEING THE SAFE CLOSURE. AND A REMOVAL OF ALL OF THE FACILITY. WE ARE ENSURING THAT EXCITE CLEANS UP CONTAMINATION RESULTING FROM THE OPERATIONS AT THE SITE. AND WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO RECOVER THE COST OF THE CLEANUP WORK. THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BY DGSE. STATE AND FEDERAL LAW REQUIRE THAT EGGS I'D IDENTIFIES AND CLEANED UP BOTH THE ON SITE AND THE OFF SITE CONTAMINATION. THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM OPERATIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. OVER THE HISTORY OF THE SITE. EXIDE HAS TO COLLECT DATA. TO CHARACTERIZE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THAT OFF SITE AND ON SITE CONTAMINATION AND THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE OPTIONS TO REMEDIATE IT. DTS HE OVERSEES ALL OF THESE ACTIONS. AND IT'S OUR JOB TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS WILL BE. NORMALLY THE STATE DOESN'T FUND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES WHEN THERE'S A RESPONSIBLE PARTY THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED TO UNDERTAKE THAT WORK. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THIS COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE REGAL LEGAL WRANGLING THAT WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER BY THE MANY SPEAKERS. GOVERNOR BROWN REQUESTED IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OF THE GENERAL FUND LOAN. TO JUMPSTART THE CLEAN UP AND THAT WAS FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL OF THE SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE OUT OF DTS SEES OWN BUDGET. TO DO SOME INITIAL WORK. THESE FUNDS HAVE ALLOWED THE TSC TO CLEAN UP THE MOST IMPACTED PROPERTIES SOONER. AND TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE MOST MOST VULNERABLE TO THE CONTAMINATION. WHILE THIS CLEANUP WORK THAT WE'RE OVERSEEING IS UNDER WAY. DGSE IS ALSO OVERSEEING THE WORK THAT EXCITE IS REQUIRED TO DO. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU JUST A BRIEF SENSE OF THE TIMELINE. FOR THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON TO HOLD THE EXILED ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CLEAN UP THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERTAKING. EXCITE IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT WHAT IS CALLED A RESIDENTIAL CORRECTIVE MEASURES STUDY. FOR THE OFF SITE RESIDENTIAL CONTAMINATION AND THEY HAVE TO DO THAT BY MAY TWENTY FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN THIS DEADLINE IS PART OF AN ENFORCEABLE ORDER. LAST MONTH ON JULY SIXTH DTS HE ISSUED A CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF EXILES WORK PLAN TO CHARACTERIZE THAT RESIDENTIAL CONTAMINATION AROUND THE SITE. AND WE DIRECTED THAT THEY TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE WORK NEED. OUR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL ALLOWED INSIDE TO MAKE USE OF THE SOIL SAMPLING DATA WE'VE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AREA. BUT WE ALSO REQUIRED THEM. TO IDENTIFY THE DATA GAP OUR APPROVAL AND TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA THAT'S NEEDED TO FULLY CHARACTERIZE THE FULL EXTENT. OF THE TYPE AND EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION. DTS YOU WILL REVIEW EXCITES PROPOSED CLEANUP ALTERNATIVES WILL TAKE COMMENT FROM ALL OF YOU AND FROM ANYONE ELSE WHO IS INTERESTED. AND THEN WILL ISSUE A DETERMINATION ON WHAT EXCITED NEEDS TO DO TO CLEAN UP THAT-CONTAMINATION AS WELL AS THE TIME LINES. FOR UNDERTAKING THAT CLEANUP. AFTER DTS HE APPROVES CLEANUP ACTIONS THAT EXILED HAS TO TAKE EXAMS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO US FINANCIAL ASSURANCE FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF ALL OF THAT CLEANUP ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION THE ORDER I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY PREVENTS EXILED FROM DRAWING DOWN ON THE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE THEY'VE ALREADY PROVIDED TO US. UNTIL ALL OF THE ONSITE AND OFF SITE CLEANUP WORK IS DONE. DTS HE CLOSELY OVERSEAS EGGS IDEC DVDS. AS THEY ARE UNDER WAY NOW WE HAVE WEEKLY CONFERENCE CALLS TO TRACK EXCITES PROGRESS ON THEIR CLOSURE AND ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT. OF THE PROPOSED CLEANUP ALTERNATIVES AND WE'VE ALSO HIRED A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR WHO MONITORS EXCITES COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLOSURE PLAN AT ALL TIMES THAT WORK IS UNDER WAY AT THE FACILITY. ESPECIALLY THEY'RE CARRYING OUT OF THE PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. DID HE HAS HE IS ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO COORDINATE ACTIVITIES AND ENSURE THAT ALL NECESSARY STEPS ARE TAKEN. TO HOLD EXILED ACCOUNTABLE. WE'RE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER PARTIES WHO COULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTAMINATION IN THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AREA OR ANY OF THE OTHER AREAS WHERE EXCITES CONTAMINATION MAY BE FOUND. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOU. THE DTS YEARS WORKING DILIGENTLY. ON MULTIPLE FRONTS. TO RESTORE THESE COMMUNITIES. TO HOLD THE EXILED AND ANY OTHER ACCOUNT PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CONTAMINATION. AND I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION FOR YOUR CONTINUED INTEREST FOR THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE LOCAL LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS. SUPERVISORS POLICE COUNCILMEMBER FREEZE ARE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP YOUR COLLABORATION AS WE WORK TOGETHER. TO ENSURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY THANK YOU. THANK YOU END UP BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS SECRETARY RETREAT AS WANT TO HAVE SOME CONCLUDING COMMENTS I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I AND I KNOW WHAT FORM AND SCOUNDREL LONG PRESENTATION SO I'LL I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK HERE. AS AN ADMINISTRATION -- I I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE MAY -- AS A MINISTRATION I'D LIKE TO THINK WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE -- AMONG THE MANY THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- WE ADOPTED THE CALAVERAS SCREEN TOOL THAT HELPS US TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. THAT WE AND STAB WHICH A VIRAL JUSTICE TASK FORCE TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND BOYLE HEIGHTS AND CLIMB UP -- AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE DIRECTED OVER ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- IN FUNDING -- TO DISADVANTAGE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. NONE THE LESS I WANT TO SAY HERE THAT -- ONE OF MY CHIEF CONCERNS IS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE TO ADVANCE THE CLEANUP OF THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE X. I. FACILITY. AND I I KNOW THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW I CAN SAY THAT ON AND IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO SAY THAT WHEN I'M NOT THE PERSON WHO IS LIVING WITH THE CONTAMINATION IN MY YARD SO I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION. IN THE COMMUNITIES. AT ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE IT REALLY HAS NOT BEEN FOR LACK OF TRYING ON THE PART OF DTS SEE -- AS YOU'VE HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE. SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS TO EXPEDITE THE CLEANUP OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE SURROUNDING THE EXITE FACILITY -- DGSE GOT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM EXCITEMENT WAS IN BANKRUPTCY TO CLEAN UP WHAT WE FELT AT THE TIME WERE THE MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES CLOSEST TO THE OTHER FORMER FACILITY -- WHEN WE FOUND OUT THEY WERE THERE ARE MORE ISSUES THERE DGSE USE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM SOME OF THE EXISTING FUNDING TO CLEAN UP FIFTY OF THE MOST HEAVILY CONTAMINATED UP PROPERTIES IN THE AREA? ON IN IN TWENTY FIFTY ONE SAMPLING HAD SHOWN UP AT THE CONTAMINATION WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN ANYBODY ANTICIPATED -- THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO SAMPLE ESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TO CLEAN UP THE YARD WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH THAT FIGURE. THAT FIGURE WAS DIRECTED TO THE EVER PROPERTIES THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO BE AT THE THE MOST CONTAMINATED -- AND WE DID ALL THAT AND APPROPRIATED THAT FUND FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF BECAUSE DTS SEES BUDGET IS ONLY OF ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FEELS LIKE TEN OR TWENTY DOLLARS HERE SOMETIME BUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN ANY GIVEN YEAR SO IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK. NOW YOU'VE HEARD WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS VERSUS TO WORK -- THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED AND THEN USE TO JUMP START THE CLEAN UP BUT RATHER THAN WAITING FOR EXCITED TO DEVELOP BUT ITS PLAN OR RELYING ON A TIME CONSUMING THE LEGAL LOVE BATTLE TO FORCE EXCITED TO CONDUCT THE CLEAN UP. ON AND WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS -- AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LET UP I I YOU KNOW I WANT TO MENTION THAT OUT OF THE TOC STAFF OF A PROXY NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES FIFTY ONE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING ON X. SIDE. OF FULL TIME AND WE'VE GOT OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE SITTING IN THE AS NECESSARY -- NOW I KNOW I WAS DISAPPOINTED -- TO WHEN THE CONTRACT THAT FELL THROUGH THAT WAS GOING TO DO THIS WORK BUT WE WERE COMMITTED TO MOVING THIS ALONG AND THAT'S WHY WE SAID OKAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO STOP AT THIS POINT. LET'S PICK UP ONE OF OUR EXISTING CONTRACTORS TO DO SOME WORK AND GET SOME WORK IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE FIX THIS CONTRACT SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN. AND MOSAN AS DESCRIBED HOW WE'VE BEEN PICKING THAT UP WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE ADDITIONAL UP -- PROPERTIES CLEANED UP AND WHEN THAT WORK FINISHES WE WILL PICK UP WITH THE NEW CONTRACT THAT WILL COME IN -- TO INTO BEING HIMSELF. IN THE END I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO BE ASSURED THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT -- GOING FORWARD DTS HE WILL BE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO STRETCH EVERY DOLLAR AS FAR AS WE CAN GO. TO FINISH THIS WORK AS QUICKLY AS WE THE WHOLE THE POLLUTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP THIS MESS THAT THAT THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. AND THAT INCLUDES WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TOLD EXCITE ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMPLETING THIS -- CLEAN UPS UP YOU'VE GOT OUR COMMITMENT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS -- AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO THE FINISH UP HERE MAKE THOSE COMMENTS AND NOW WE'RE ALL. READY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THEN I THINK YOU LET ME A KICK OFF THE QUESTIONSBY -- SEGUEING OFF OF OF ONE OF YOUR COMMENTS OF SECRETARY THERE HAVE IN FACT BEEN A NUMBER OF DELAYS HAVE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING I THINK TO ALL OF US AND CERTAINLY TO THE PUBLIC. OF WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT CAN WE DO TO KEEP THIS MOVING FORWARD -- SO THAT IS ON A PACE AND WE KNOW WHAT THE TIME LINE IS AND WE DON'T HAVE TO FACE FUTURE DELAYS -- I WOULD SAY THAT HAVING CONTINUED MEDIUMS SUCH AS THIS AND MOVE THE MEETINGS THAT DETAILS HE HAS TO HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY IS A GOOD WAY. TO MAKE THIS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS TO KEEP THE PRESSURE UP ON US -- I THINK THAT REPORTING THAT TO THE COMMUNITY ON THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK IS AN IMPORTANT WAY THAT IT'S THE YARDSTICK BY WHICH WE SHOULD BE MEASURED AND MOVING AHEAD -- I'LL LET THE BARBER OR MODES AND THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT WE MIGHT BE DOING BUT WE AS I THINK CAME OUT OF MY A LOT FROM THIS AS TIME HAS GONE ON WE'VE LEARNED THE BETTER BETTER WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND WORTH CONTINUING TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO WORK ON THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. JUST BRIEFLY LET ME SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE WE WENT THROUGH THE ORIGINAL INVITATION FOR BID PROCESS WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE CONTRACTOR -- THAT WAS SELECTED AND AND SURVIVE THE APPEAL I WAS NOT ABLE TO DELIVER A CONTRACT WITH US THAT. MET THE TERMS OF THEIR BID AND WAS GOING TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY AND DELIVER THE CLEAN UP AT THE CLOCK COMMUNITY DESERVES. OUT WE DID LEARN FROM THAT -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND I ACTUALLY BEEN HIRED ONE OF THEIR EXPERTS A CONTRACTING ATTORNEYS. IN ORDER. TO FIND SOME CREATIVE WAYS WITHIN THE LAW THAT WE CAN EXPEDITE THE CONTRACTING WERE OF PURSUING THAT ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FRONTS WERE IN ACTIVE NEGOTIATIONS NOW. A WE DID AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED WOULD FIND A WAY. TO BRING -- AN INTERIM CONTRACT FOR A PLANNED FULLY AT THIS POINT AND WE HAVE MAPPED OUT A PATH WHERE WE WILL BE ABLE. TO RAMP UP -- TO THE FULL PRODUCTION THAT WE EXPECTED TO REACH IN THE CLEANUP PLAN WE WILL REACH THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN THAT PROGRESS EVEN AS WE BRING NEW CONTRACTS ONLINE. THANK YOU WE MET SOME OF THOSE FOLKS TODAY -- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY SEEM VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND COMMITTED TO GETTING THE JOB DONE I WAS SO VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HIS CAREER. SO I'D I'D REALLY WOULD LIKE TO DIVE INTO THE PROCESS OF THE CONTRACT. I WON A COMMITMENT FROM DTS SEEN ON A REALISTIC TIME LINE AS TO THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THAT DID AND MOVE FORWARD. AND WHATWILL THAT CONTRACT LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE AND WHAT YOUR TIME LINE IS TO DETERMINE. A CONTRACT IN AN AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO DO THE WORK THAT'S GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO THE WORK THAT'S GOING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME HIGHS AND LOWS. IN ENSURING THAT THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD IN A QUICK. MANNER BUT THAT ALSO IS NOT DONE IN A WAY THAT [inaudible] IN HASTE. BUT THAT IT'S DONE CORRECTLY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HONORING THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THAT WAS AGREED UPON -- AND ENSURING THAT THE LOCAL HIRE IS ACTUALLY A LOCAL HIRE. SAID LIKE SOME SOME COMMITMENTS FROM YOU IN A REALISTIC TIME LINE. WELL I'M ABSOLUTELY ABLE TO GIVE YOU OUR COMMITMENT WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THAT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT IT IS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. THE FIRST PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT ANY STATE DEPARTMENT HAS IN CALIFORNIA HAS ACTUALLY DIRECTLY NEGOTIATED SO I WAS VERY PROUD OF MY STAFF FOR ACCOMPLISHING THAT -- AND WORD. MUCH COMMITTED TO IT OUR CHIEF OBJECTIVE WITH THAT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WAS THE LOCAL HIRE COMPONENT. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE OFTEN PRIORITIZED IN PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR US IT WAS THE LOCAL HIRE COMPONENT WE'VE WORKED OUT CAREFULLY WITH THE UNIONS -- TO ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO TAKE PART IN OUR WORKFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION FOR COMMUNITIES TRAINING HAVE A PATH TO UNION MEMBERSHIP IF THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE IT. I AM WE ARE PROVIDING. AN ARRAY OF TRAINING SO THAT CAN WORK UP FOR COMPENSATION ON THIS PROJECT WHETHER THEY'RE ON A UNION MEMBERSHIP AFTER NOT SO WE'RE WE'RE VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO THAT IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACTING ITSELF -- THE CONTRACTING NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONFIDENTIAL SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT HOW THOSE ARE GOING WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE PATH WE'VE MARKED OUT. WILL ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRESS ON THE CLEAN UP AS WE TRANSITION CONTRACTS SO WE'VE LOOKED AT WAYS TO ESTABLISH THE CONTRACTS BRING THEM FORWARD SUCH THAT. WE WILL REACH AND MAINTAIN THAT -- THAT CLEAN OPERATE AND THE THE DETAILS OF WHEN AND HOW THE CONTRACT OR CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED OUT WON'T IMPEDE THAT. I'LL JUST SAY THAT AS AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE GOAL IS TO HAVE NO BREAK BETWEEN THE COMPLETION OF THE EXISTING WORK IN THIS NEW CONTRACT -- AND SO -- YOU CAN. I'LL GIVE YOU MY INSURANCE MY OWN THAT I WILL ASK ABOUT THE CONTRACT EVERY DAY UNTIL IT'S SIGNED AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IT DONE -- OKAY AND AND IF YOU WANT TO CALL ME THAT'S FINE WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT IS I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST TEXTING. THE SUGGESTION. MS GARCIA. YES THANK YOU I HAVE. TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST QUESTION WAS NOT TOUCHED IN YOUR PRESENTATION AND I WANT CLARIFICATION. I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL -- TO NOT CLEAN INITIALLY AND YEAH HOMES THAT WERE AT EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION OR HIGHER THAT'S THE STANDARD WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HERE THAT'S A PROPOSAL TO TRY TO MOVE THAT TO FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION WHICH IS THE FEDERAL STANDARD. WHAT'S THE ACCURACY OF THAT STATEMENT AND IF WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE COMFORTABLE WITH THE A LEVEL THAT THE STATE IS NOT COMFORTABLE IN GENERAL ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GARCIA WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CLEANUP. STANDARDS -- EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION IS A SCREENING LEVEL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE OUT BY THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT DTS USES THAT. AT THIS SITE AND AT OTHER SITES AS WELL -- DDS HE WAS APPROPRIATED. MONEY TO CLEAN UP THE MOST -- IMPACTED PROPERTIES THE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LEAD AND THE GREATEST EXPOSURE TO SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS -- WE RECEIVED ENOUGH FUNDING TO CLEAN UP APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES. THAT'S NOT ALL OF THE PROPERTIES% THAT ARE THAT ARE TESTING SHOWS HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STRETCH THAT FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CLEANING UP ALL OF THE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OR LESS. OF LEAD OR HIGHER -- AS WELL AS THE HOT SPOTS THAT THE COMMUNITIES WERE WORRIED ABOUT WHERE EVEN THOUGH THE OF THE THE REPRESENTATIVE LEAD LEVEL OF THE PROPERTY WAS. FOUR HUNDRED THERE MIGHT HAVE OR BELOW FOUR HUNDRED THERE MY A SINGLE SAMPLE THAT WAS ABOVE A THOUSAND AND WE ARE CLEANING UP ALL OF THOSE AS WELL. SO WE HAVEN'T CHANGED THE ULTIMATE GOAL BUT WE HAVE INDEED -- BEEN ABLE TO CLEAN UP TO FOUR HUNDRED WITH THE THE FUNDING WE HAVE NOW THAT I WANT TO BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND ALSO. THAT WHEN WE CLEAN THE PROPERTY UP WE IDENTIFY THE PROPERTY THAT'S ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED BUT WHEN WE CLEAN IT UP WE CLEAN IT UP. TO EIGHTY THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. AND THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND QUESTION WE ALL KNOW WE NEED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN CLEAR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE FROM HALF A BILLION TO UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS. TO JUST FOR THE CLEAN UP THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE HEALTH IMPACTS AND OTHER NEAT THAT WE HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH. CONTAMINATION WE WE PASSED AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE WITH THAT WHICH IS A LETTER BATTERY FEE BILL STARTING TO COLLECT FUNDS IN THAT CITY WHY ARE WE TAKING THAT MONEY AND USING IT TO PAY BACK A LOAN INSTEAD OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE IT THERE TO WE COULD CLEAN. UP THE OTHER HOMES AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE PROMISE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. THIS MAY BE A IT IT IT THIS WEEK TO WAIT ON THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND WE KNOW. HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO NEED AND AND AT THE RATE AT WHICH THAT BATTERY BILL IS? IS COLLECTING FINE I I HOPEFULLY IN FLORIDA WE ARE COMMITTED TO LEAVING THAT MONEY THERE FOUR TO TEN THE PURPOSE AND WE DO NOT USE IT TO PAY BACK THE LOAN UNTIL AFTER WE HAVE CLEANED UP ALL THESE FILMS AND WE HAVE A LET. ANYONE BEHIND -- INCREASE THAT FEE BECAUSE AT THE RATE AT WHICH WERE COLLECTING WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT A LOT MORE HOW. IT'S FRUSTRATING. TO TO COME HOME BECAUSE THESE ARE MY NEIGHBORS. ODD TO SEE THE DESPAIR IN THEIR FACE WHEN THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NOW BEEN ENGAGED AND EDUCATED OF THE LEVEL OF TOXICITY AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND THOSE FORCES. AND THEY FEEL HELPLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS AND OURSELVES. ARE LIVING IN A CONTINUAL EXPOSURE AT MAKING THEM SICK AND THERE THAT I'M EXCITED WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE ROAD WHETHER IT'S CANCER WHAT IS THE LAST TIME A BATH MUCH. INDEED CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE BEING TOLD YOU KNOW WHAT JUST CLOSE YOUR DOORS AND CLOSER WHEN THOSE WHO WERE JUST OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL DAY OF HOW WARM IT IS THAT'S NOT UNLIKE THAT OF PRAGMATIC SOLUTION. ON AND BOOKS ARE GONNA BE WAITING AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING TWO YEARS FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS FOR CLEAN UP. I THINK WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT KID THAT WAS BORN INTO THIS CONTAMINATION. AT FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OR TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION AND WHAT WE KNOW IT DOES. AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT TEN YEARS FOR THE CLEANUP AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR LIKE A LEADER AS TAXPAYERS. DON'T WE OWE THAT KID BETTER. THEY ARE NOT. AND SO I WE ARE THINKING OF CLEAN UP BUT WE'RE ALSO THINKING OF OTHER CREATIVE WAYS AND WE START THINKING ABOUT POSSIBLY WE NEED TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS. FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MAYBE HELP TO FUNDING FOR THAT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO BUT WE HAVE TO START THINKING BEYOND JUST CLOSE YOUR DOORS AND CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS AND WAIT FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS. UP TO DO THIS. AND SO IF THIS IS THE BEST WE COULD DO AND IS AS FAST AS WE COULD CLEAN UP I CAN'T KEEP COMING HOME AND TELLING PEOPLE TO SWAY. WE HAVE TO START THINKING OF OTHER WAYS TO DO THIS AND IF IT'S OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE UPON THAT ONLY THIS BACK. WE HAVE ENOUGH TALENT COLLECTIVELY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING SOME OF THESE DOWN AT THEM AND THEN DOWN IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS MOMENTS. THANK YOU FOLKS WE'RE GONNA GET TO MISTER SANTIAGO JUST A SECOND I'M GRATIFIED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT -- WE'VE GOT PEOPLE STANDING AROUND THE SIDES OF THE ROOM IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY SEAT NEXT TO YOU TO MIND RAISING YOUR HAND SO THAT FOLKS WERE STANDING UP THERE ONCE IT DOWN -- CAN CAN GRAB A SEAT MISTER SANTIAGO. I WILL REPEAT I WON'T REPEAT OUR ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID SO WELL BUT WHAT I MIGHT CHALLENGE YOU WANT. IS TO FIND OUT SPECIFICALLY AND I KNOW YOU ALLUDED TO IT WHAT PLAN AND HOW MANY HOUSES WE CAN EXPECT TO BE CLEANED UP BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WE'VE HAD SOME HEATED DEBATES. AND ALL OF OUR OFFICES ABOUT WHAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT LOOK LIKE -- ABOUT AS WE WERE TOLD A WALKING AROUND THERE'S A RAMP UP PHASE NOW -- THE LEGISLATURE'S DEMANDED MY COLLEAGUES ARE ARE PRESSING FOR IT. WHAT DOES THAT RAMP BUT THESE LOOK LIKE A TO THE VOLUME THAT WILL BE CLEANED UP? EIGHTEEN WE INCREASE THAT CLEAN UP. AND A AND IF THE IF THE ANSWER IS WE CAN'T BECAUSE OF X. Y. AND Z. THAT WHAT WE DO ON OUR SIDE TO CHANGE OUT LOUD TO MAKE THAT EXPLAINS THE GO AWAY SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE SOME SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR -- WHAT IS THAT NUMBER AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IN THE RAMP FACE WENT? MOSTLY NEWS TOUCHED ON THAT A LITTLE AND THANK YOU THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AND I THINK IN MY PRESENTATION I DID MENTION THAT. AS OF THIS WEEK WE HAVE THIRTEEN CRUISE OUT IN THE FIELD AND THERE SCHEDULING TWELVE TO FIFTEEN PROPERTIES PER WEEK. SO IF YOU JUST COUNT HOW MANY WEEKS ARE LEFT TO THE END OF THE YEAR WE CAN WE CAN. ESTABLISH A ROUGH NUMBER ON HOW MANY PROPERTIES WILL BE CLEANING BUT ONCE WE GET. ONCE YOU KNOW ONCE WE GET TO THE NEXT CONTRACT WE ARE PLANNING TO WRAP THIS UP EVEN FURTHER AND GO UP TO AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE PROPERTIES PER WEEK. SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT NUMBER BUT I THINK YOU CAN GET A SENSE THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PROPERTIES THAT WE ARE OUR TARGET TO CLEAN UP TO THE END THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING HERE. AS OUR COMMITMENT AND AS ORACLE. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT LIMITS THE RATE THE THE THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT AFFECT THE RAMP UP. THE FIRST IS WE WANT TO EXPAND THE RATE. ONLY AS FAST AS WE CAN SAFELY. INSURE THAT ALL THE LOGISTICS ARE DONE PROPERLY THE CLEANUP IS DONE PROPERLY IF YOU IF WE HAD EVERYBODY OUT GOING. FULL BORE RIGHT AWAY THERE WOULD BE A GREATER. CHANCE THAT THINGS WOULD NOT GO WELL AT A GIVEN PROPERTY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT. AND SO WE'RE GRADUALLY INCREASING THE RATE TO MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT. THE SECOND THING THAT AFFECTS IT IS HOW MANY ACCESS AGREEMENTS WE ARE ABLE TO SECURE YOUHEARD -- AT MISTER SATAN IS AND HUNDRED PROPERTIES READY TO BE. CLEANED UP WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PROPERTIES WITH ACCESS AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH THE LANDSCAPING SELECTED SO -- WHAT THE COMMUNITY WHAT THE COMMUNITY CAN DO IS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HAVING YOUR PROPERTY CLEANED UP AND YOU'VE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT YOU'RE PART OF THIS -- PHASE OF THE CLEAN UP PLEASE WORK WITH US TO QUICKLY GET ACCESS AGREEMENTS IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY HAVE BEEN DOING SOME ROUGH CALCULATIONS IN MY HEAD AND MY SENSE IS THAT THE ANSWER TO YOU IS WE SHOULD BE DONE WITH THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THAT WE STARTED IN MAY BUY SOMETIME IN OCTOBER. THAT WAS THE GOALS I REQUIRE SO THAT'S THAT TRUNKS WE WERE TRYING TO DO BEFORE WE GOT THE LARGER CONTRACT IN THE PLACE. IN THE GOAL I THINK AS I RECALL FROM THE BRIEFING DOCUMENTS WAS TO HAVE. THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT FIRST SET THE ONES THAT WERE PAYING FOR WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION DONE. WITHIN TWO YEARS BECAUSE THIS AFTER I RECALL THAT CORRECT SO THAT'S THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN ADDITIONAL ONE FROM MAY TO OCTOBER. AND THEN WE HOPE TO HAVE THIS FIRST GROUP THAT'S PAYING FOR BY THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION -- DONE WITHIN TWO YEARS. SO I'M READING THIS RIGHT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THAT WOULD GET DONE BY OCTOBER. NO NO WE WE SHOULD BE HAVING THAT. SINCE WE STARTED IN MAY WE SHOULD HAVE DONE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR SO BY OCTOBER SET TO HIKE OVER FIFTEEN WEEK WE RAMP IT UP FROM FIVE PROPERTIES A WEEK UP TO NOW 212-215- PROPERTIES PER WEEK BUT WE WE ARE UP PROBABLY OVER EIGHTY PROPERTIES OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN THAT. WE WERE PLANNING TO CLEAN UP AND SO WE HAVE CLEAN UP MY ACT OVER AND AFTER DAD WE'RE GOING TO RAMP UP TO THE NEXT CONTRACT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN UP. SOMEWHERE IN THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PER WEEK SO THAT WILL GIVE US ANOTHER -- NOVEMBER DECEMBER YOUNG MINDS AND AND THAT WAS MY QUESTION IF IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TO OCTOBER THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. AND THE POSSIBLE RAMP UP FACE GOES. TO TWENTY FIVE FOR WEEK. AT WHEN YOU DO THE MATH ALINA LIST MY UNLESS I MISSED SOMETHING HERE WE COULD BE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY HOLDING HOLDING THE TSA ACCOUNTABLE FOR FIVE HUNDRED SOMEONE ONLY FORTY IN THE YEAR. POTENTIALLY YES BUT IT WILL TAKE AWHILE TO RAMP UP TO TWENTY FIVE WE WON'T START THAT INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE NEW CONTRACT [inaudible] MISS KOREA [inaudible] SO. LIKE WHAT I REALLY ENJOY ABOUT THIS HEARING IS THAT WE'RE ALL COMING FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES -- HE'S LOS ANGELES IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS 20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE I'M SURE. SOMEONE OR SOME GOGGLES AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND SHARE VERY SIMILAR STATISTICS. NOT ONLY ARE WE INTERESTED IN THE CLEANUP BUT I'M ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN WHICH THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE HERE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS TYPE OF WORK AND THAT THE TRAINING IS AVAILABLE. SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE TO FIFTEEN PROPERTIES OF WEAK RAMPING UP FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE PROPERTIES OF WEAK MOVING FORWARD. HOW MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY CURRENTLY EMPLOYED? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT WE WILL GET THAT NUMBER FOR YOU [inaudible] YEAH. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US. YEAH SO MY ROUGH CALCULATION ON OF HOW MANY OF OUR JOB TO BE COMPLETE BUT TO COMPLETE PER MONTH IF YOU'RE DOING. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE AND WE SEEM AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHTY FIVE PER MONTH. SENSES ARE ANOTHER WAY OF OF OF OF LOOKING AT WITH THE GOAL MIGHT BE HERE WHAT COURSE SHOULD WE WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THROUGH THE HOLIDAY SEASON. ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO HAVE THEIR PROPERTIES WORKED ON TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WE WILL ABSOLUTELY MAINTAIN. THAT PACE THROUGH THE HOLIDAY SEASON BUT BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT FOLKS WILL BE. I UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT COULD BE COULD BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. I DO ACTUALLY I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION ON YOUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATION TO YOU JUST A COUPLE MINUTES AGO. ON PARKWAYS. SO THE STATUS THE STATE LEGISLATURE THE STATE ASSEMBLY THAT WERE WORKED JUST DID A SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ADDITIONAL. BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR PARKWAYS AND YOU MENTIONED THAT PARKWAYS OUR PUBLIC. SO IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TSC WILL NOW BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CLEANUP [inaudible] I'M EXCITED IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP. ALL OF THE CONTAMINATION RELEASED FROM THE OPERATIONS AT THAT SITE. WHETHER IT IS ON PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY ON PUBLIC PROPERTY OR ON A COMMERCIALLY OWNED PROPERTY SO WE ARE DOING TESTING THROUGHOUT THE AREA -- DTS WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE CLEAN UP OF THE PART WAYS WITH THE SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED FOR THAT PURPOSE -- WE DID NOT HAVE PARKWAYS IN THE ORIGINAL CLEANUP PLANS SO AS MISTER MISS ME I EXPLAINED WE HAVE TO AT THE WAY THE LAW WORKS FOR US WE HAVE. TO DO THE TESTING DO THE CLEANUP PLAN AND THEN DO THE CLEANUP. THE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WOULD JUST APPROPRIATED FOR THE PARK WASTE IS THAT SUFFICIENT FOR TESTING AND CLEAN UP OR IS THAT JUST. TESTING IT IS FOR TESTING AND CLEAN UP IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CLEAN UP ALL PARKWAYS IN THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AREA ARE WE STARTING TO DISCUSS WAYS TO GUARANTEE THAT DIGITAL FUNDING THAT WE NEED FOR THE CLEAN UP SO WE DON'T EVEN THE OF THIS PARK WITH BEHIND. DTS HE IS ON DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT EXIDE IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CARRYING OUT THE CLEANUP OF ALL OF THE CONTAMINATION THAT WAS RELEASED FROM THE OPERATIONS AT THAT SITE -- THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO AND WE'RE DOING IT. AS DILIGENTLY AS WE CAN AND MORE THE GENERAL'S OFFICE TO GET THAT DONE. BUT I WOULD ADD THAT -- IF WE FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS PARKWAY IS IF WE FIND OUT THAT THE SIX POINT ONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT WILL COME BACK AND WILL BE. OUR ENEMY TO TALK TO THE LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DEAL WITH THIS WHETHER WE USE. LEAD ACID BATTERY FINDING WHERE WITH THE FUNDING WOULD COME FROM IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE UP PARKWAYS BEFORE COULD MAKE A FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS THAT SOME OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY -- IF I MIGHT TO ADELPHIA ON THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WE WILL BEGIN OUR BUDGET PROCESS AND NEW AS WE DO EVERY YEAR AND TO SEE YOU ALL SOMETIME AFTER JANUARY WHEN -- THE ASSEMBLY BEGINS ITS -- BUDGET CONSIDERATION BUT THE SEX THINKING THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A YEAR LONG PROCESS WE AND ONE BUDGET. AS OF THE END OF JUNE WHEN WE PASS OUR BUDGET FOR THE YEAR AND AS SOON AS THAT WAS OVER WE START THE CYCLE OVER AGAIN IN THE WORK AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL AND IT -- IS IS ON GOING SO IN THAT -- IN THAT VEIN. LET ME JUST SAY NOW THAT WE ARE -- IN BUDGETS UP THREE GOING TO WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT THE STATUS OF EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS IS -- AND WHEN YOU PROJECT -- IF IT'S SO IN THE COMING GOT A BUDGET CYCLE IF FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE DEPLETED AND DISAPPEAR WE WANT TO KNOW THAT SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST TRY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR BUDGETS CAN LOOK LIKE THIS YEAR. BUT WE WANT TO TRY AND KEEP THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND MAKE ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU PROVIDE YOUR PREPARED TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION. I COULD ADD TO THAT TO FINISH OFF ON MY QUESTION AND THE COMMENT. YOU KNOW THE PARK WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ASKING. FOR FOR WAS THE VERY BEGINNING AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT'S BEEN ALMOST SIX YEARS. AND WE FINALLY HAVE APPROPRIATED THE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT BEHIND. AND WE KNOW THERE'S REALLY HIGH PROBABILITY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH MONEY HOW MUCH WE NEED THIS HOLLY THE QUESTION THAT'S OUTSTANDING AND THAT'S WHAT THE TESTING WILL HELP -- ANSWER BUT I THINK WE CAN NOW START. TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION KNOW WHERE WOULD THIS MONEY COME FROM TO TO COME FROM. OUR GENERAL FUND IS TO COME FROM A BATTERY FIELD AND SOME MODIFICATIONS THERE IS A COMPANY SOMEPLACE ELSE. AND THAT WORK SHOULD BE DONE NOW WITH BUILDING TO BE INTRODUCED SHOULD BE INTRODUCED IN JANUARY. AND NOT WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE THE EXACT ANSWER OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. I THINK BEING PROACTIVE IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH WE GAIN THE COMMUNITY STRESSED -- MISS LEE AT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THE MEETINGS AND YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS TO THE BEING ABLE TO LOOK UP ONLINE REALLY QUICKLY WHAT THE DATA WAREHOUSE. IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT ON THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE -- YOU KNOW HOW I MEAN I DO SAY I'M HAPPY IN MY HOUSE IS FAIRLY CLEAN IN MY YARD LOOKS REALLY GOOD SERVICE WILL BE PART OF THE WAY HER YOUNGER LOAD. IS REALLY GOOD AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THOSE. THOSE SUCCESSES BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THOSE SUCCESSES AND AND I THINK BE PRACTICAL HOW COMPLICATED THIS PROCESS IS AND TRY. TO ACT A LITTLE BIT SOONER. OFF BUT THE COMMUNITY I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A CRITICAL THING I COULD TO DO TO CALL YOU AND BUT I WANT TO BE FRIENDS I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT IS FRUSTRATING AT THE PACE AT WHICH WE ARE GOING. AND NOW ON ON THAT NOTE WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS PANEL AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF MOMENTS I WANT TO THANK US. ARE UP A PANELIST DIRECTOR LEE A SECRETARY RETRIEVED HIS AND DOUBT DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND AS I ME UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

I CAN HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE IF YOU COULD ALL COME TO ORDER. WE NEED SOME QUIET IN THE ROOM PLEASE. OUR NEXT PANEL IS. IS HERE FOR US SO THAT WE CAN HEAR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES SAYS BUT THEY'RE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE COUNTY'S INVOLVEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN -- PRODIGIOUS AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WE HAVE WITH US TODAY AND YOU'VE ALREADY -- MANNER AND HEARD FROM HER WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE SUPERVISOR HILDA SO THESE. AND WE HAVE ALSO WITH US DIRECTOR BARBARA FOR RARE. OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IS EVERYBODY QUIET DOWN SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HEAR PLEASE. SHOW SOME RESPECT TO YOUR NEIGHBORS IN THE ROOM. FOLKS IF YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO CONTINUE WITH PLEASE TAKE THEM OUTSIDE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. AND SUPERVISORS POLICE THANK YOU SO MUCH GERMAN BLOOM AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND AGAIN REITERATE. MY GREAT THANKS TO ASSEMBLY SPEAKER RENTED FOR ACTUALLY CALLING THIS AND ALLOWING US. TO HAVE THIS MEETING HERE -- I'M VERY -- VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT TODAY AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE LINE OF QUESTIONING THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THESE IMPACTED AREAS ARE RACING. BECAUSE I TOO HAVE NOW MANY MORE QUESTIONS BUT WE ALSO HOPE TO ACHIEVE. SOME ANSWERS AND AS WAS STATED WE HAVE DOCTOR BARBER FERRER WHO WAS ALSO WITH THIS ACCOMPANYING US ON OUR TOUR. OF OF VARIOUS HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE IN SOME -- PORTION OF CLEAN UP AND REMEDIATION WE ALSO HAVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST DR ADAM LOVE. WHO SHOULD BE ALSO JOINING US HE MAY HAVE STEPPED OUT TEMPORARILY -- BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW. LOCAL GOVERNMENT STILL CONTINUES. TO SO WHEN THINGS DO HAPPEN ON THE GROUND AND THERE ARE. FIRES OR HAZMAT. ACCIDENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IS USUALLY THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AND IN THIS CASE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT LEVELS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT HEALTH. AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO ALSO VISIT. A NEW. COUNTY HEALTH CLINIC THAT HAS JUST BEEN ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WITH EXCITE. IN THE PARAMETER OF THIS AREA IT'S IMPACTED AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT TOOK A LOT OF FORESIGHT. AND IT TAKES REARRANGING PRIORITIES AT THE SUN WILL CENTER. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW. WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COUNTY SERVICES THERE. SO WE CAN DO BLOOD TESTING. FOR FAMILIES FOR INSTANCE AND FOR YOUTH. AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT I KNOW WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COUNTY ALSO. WANTS TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON OTHER HEALTH CARE OF MATTERS HEALTH CARE MATTERS TO ALL OF US AND I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE BACK IN JUNE OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN MY OFFICE TOGETHER WITH OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS WELL OVER TWELVE HERE'S MET ON A SATURDAY. AT SUNAL CENTER AND WE DEPLOYED VOLUNTEERS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR WE KNOCKED ON HOUSEHOLD DOORS. IN FACT I KNOW OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO WAS THERE AT THE OPENING BUT WE SPENT HOURS GOING THROUGH OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WE TOUCHED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS A IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND ONE THAT WAS VERY HUMBLING. BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY RESIDENTS THAT WERE OF WANTING TO TALK TO US WANTING TO HAVE SOMEBODY EXPLAIN THAT SOMEBODY CAME AND TESTED THEIR HOME. BUT DIDN'T BOTHER TO COME BACK. AND EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT. AND MANY WERE CONFUSED ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS AND WEREN'T FULLY AWARE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL THAT -- LEAD EXPOSURE HAS ON A PERSON'S BODY. AND I TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE SADLY WHAT I LEARNED IS THAT THERE WERE. A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION A LOT OF OF I THINK INABILITY TO COMMUNITY COMMUNICATE AND ARTICULATE IN A CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER. TO OUR COMMUNITY IT IS PRIMARILY AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SPANISH SPEAKING DOMINANT SPEAKERS. AND OTHERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK WHAT I CAME AWAY WITH WAS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND IT CAN'T JUST BE THE STATE IT CAN'T JUST BE THE COUNTY. IT ALSO HAS TO BE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND I REALLY BELIEVE. THAT WE SELLS A DISSERVICE IF WE DON'T ARTICULATE. WHAT THIS MEANS TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PREGNANT MOTHERS WE VISITED A HOME TODAY THAT WAS REMEDIATED? I WANT TO SAY REMEDIATED BASED ON THE CRITERIA THAT. THE DTS ASSETS AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG COUPLE THAT JUST PURCHASED A HOME THERE. AND BECAUSE OF THE CLEANUP. THE MOTHER THE FEMALE THERE WAS NOW GOING. TO HAVE A CHILD. WHAT DOES THAT SAY [inaudible] TO HER. IF HER NEIGHBORS AREAS AREN'T CLEANED UP AT THE SAME RATE AND MAGNITUDE OF HER HOUSEHOLD. HER NEIGHBORS. SO I HAVE TO ASK THAT QUESTION WHEN WE SEE WHEN WE REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE CLEANING. WHOSE HOUSE AND WHY NOT OTHERS AND WHY NOT THE PARKWAYS. AND I RAISE THAT ISSUE. I WENT TO SACRAMENTO AND TALKED WITH MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. AND WE WE WORKED WITH OUR STAFFS TO TRY TO PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH JUST CLEANING. THE SOILED AREAS IN THE FRONT YARD IN THE BACKYARD. IF YOU CAN'T PREDICT THE YOU CAN CLEAN THE PARAMETER THE PARKWAY IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHICH WAS DESCRIBED BY T. D. TSC IS PUBLIC AND THEN. RE EXPLAIN THAT EXCITES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLEANUP OF ANY LEAD CONTAMINATION THAT INCLUDES IN OUR DEFINITION THE PARKWAYS. AND WHILE THESE HOUSES ARE BEING CLEANED AND NOW THE ONES THAT WE DID SEE. I MEAN I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT I'M GLAD THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. BUT I'M NOT HAPPY IF WE THEN HAVE TO GO BACK TO YEARS LATER. AND FIGURE OUT THAT WELL SIX MILLION FOR CLEAN UP OF PARK PLACE IS NOW MADE AVAILABLE. AND THAT WON'T EVEN GET TO MAYBE THE TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED THAT WE DO NEED TO CLEAN SO I I'M I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THE MATH THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. SO WE REALLY SHOULD BE DRILLING DOWN I THINK ON THAT ASPECT AND I AND I ALSO. BELIEVE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT EVENTS IN A WAY. THAT ARTICULATES A CONCERN. A WHAT THE DISADVANTAGES ARE IF WE DO NOT CLEAN UP THE INTERIOR. OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND IT ISN'T JUST A VACUUMING EXPERIENCE IT HAS TO BE METHODICAL IN IT HAS TO BE DONE BY COMPETENT INDIVIDUALS THAT CAN ASSURE US. THAT THERE IS SAFETY. AND THAT DOES LEAD LEVELS ARE NOT AT A HIGH RATE SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE HAVE TO BE DONE. AND I AND I I WOULD SAY YES THERE'S AN IMPROVEMENT SOMEWHAT OVER WHAT HAPPENED. A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO WHEN PEOPLE WERE GIVEN A COUPON THAT WAS MAILED TO THEM. THAT WAS IN ENGLISH NOT NECESSARILY IN SPANISH AND WAS NOT EXPLAINED PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER ADVERTISEMENT COMING IN THE MAIL. IN FACT ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS IN MY OFFICE BROUGHT ME THAT COUPON AND I THOUGHT THIS IS INCREDIBLE. DID THAT WE ARE DOING THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS OCCURRING UNACCEPTABLE IN MY OPINION -- IT'S AN IMPROVED PROVED. PROCESS NOW. BUT MY NEXT QUESTION IS AT THE RATE OF CLEANUP IF WE ARE ONLY GOING TO DO TWENTY TO MAYBE TWENTY FIVE HOUSES. AND NOT THE PARKWAYS IT'S STILL GOING TO TAKE US. MAYBE FOR FIVE YEARS. FOR CLEAN UP OF OF A TOTAL NUMBER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PRIORITIES THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. IS TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET MORE CALM IS HERE. BECAUSE IF YOU RELY ON ONE OR TWO THAT IS INSUFFICIENT I DIDN'T HEAR THAT DISCUSSION. AND THE POSSIBILITIES YOU HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE HIRED UP AS CONTRACTORS WE OUGHT TO BE SOMEHOW INCREASING. THAT FEEL TEAM AND MAKING THAT INVESTMENT NOW. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY CAN BE MONEY FOUND IN THE BUDGET I WOULD HOPE AND MAYBE GOING BACK TO OF WHAT - SIMPLY MEMBER CHRISTINA GARCIA TALKED ABOUT WAS LOOKING AT THE BY THE BATTERY FEE THAT I BELIEVE HAS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY MILLION OR MORE DOLLARS. THERE AND EACH YEAR THAT WILL. CONTINUE. TO INCREASE -- I THINK IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT OUR ROLE IS AT THE COUNTY? AND WE HAVE A ROLE. AND ON THE BUSES WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHO WAS INVOLVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT WE'RE TRYIG TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN EXPEDITE OUR PERMIT PROCESS. AND I THINK OUR STAFF WILL WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS -- CURRENTLY FOR A HOUSEHOLD IT IS GOING TO BE. PERMITTED TO BE CLEANED UP THE GOING RATE CAN GO ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN HUNDRED TO FOUR TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER HOUSE. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO AS BEST WE CAN TO REDUCE THAT AND THAT WON'T BE A COST. THAT WOULD BE PASSED ON TO THE HOUSEHOLD. OWNER OR TENANT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD GO TO DO TSC. BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE OUR INSPECTORS. OUT THERE AND MONITORING SO I I WANT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT WILL DO WHAT WE CAN. IN THAT MANNER -- BUT I THINK THAT THE URGENCY. OF CLEANING UP. CAN'T BE UNDERSCORED ENOUGH. AND THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT ANY HOUSEHOLD IT HAS. AND THE ONES THAT WE SAW TODAY AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THOSE ARE HIGH RISK PROPERTIES WITH A THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION. AND THE STANDARD IS AS WE KNOW IS MUCH LOWER. SO WE ARE WE ARE ALLOWING FOR THIS TO CONTINUE IN THE NEXT. THREE TO FOUR FIVE YEARS AT THE SAME PACE. OF REMEDIATION I DON'T THINK THAT IS ACCEPTABLE BY ANYBODY WHO LOGICALLY LOOKS AT WHAT THE IMPACT. THAT LEAD POISONING HAS ON A CHILD ON A PREGNANT WOMAN AND ON INDIVIDUALS THAT REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITY. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO YEARS AGO TO BRING UP A YOUNG MAN I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S HERE TODAY -- ANTHONY THINGS HAPPENING AND UP. WHEN MEMBERS OF THE? COMMITTEE THAT WE SPOKE BEFORE -- SAW THE PICTURES THAT I SHARED. OF THIS YOUNG MAN. HE LOOKED AS THOUGH HE WAS AGE. TWELVE WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF AGE. HAD SPINAL OF DISFIGUREMENT. BRAIN TUMOR. AND HAD OTHER AILMENTS HE LIVED VERY CLOSE TO EXCITE. NOT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR SOME PEOPLE TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE. OF THE EXPOSURE OVER TIME. THIRTY THREE YEARS IS ONE PART OF IT BUT NOW A NEW LIFE A LIFE THAT IS IS TENDER THAT'S FIVE YEARS OLD IT'S GROWING UP HERE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SUFFER. BECAUSE THIS WILL BE ONGOING FOR YEARS TO COME. AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THAT WE HAVE YET TO UNCOVER BASED ON THE CONTAMINANTS OVER THE PAST DECADES WE WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH THE TSC. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THIS LEGISLATURE WE ALSO WANT TO WORK WITH THE NEW INCOMING GOVERNOR. WHO IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND HAS GONE ON RECORD ALREADY SAYING THAT HE IS VERY INTERESTED? AND WE WANT TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. SO I I REALLY. I'M VERY VERY -- THRILLED. DID YOU YOU HAD DECIDED TO COME AND SPEND HOURS HERE TODAY. AND IT IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE I THINK FOR MANY OF US BUT FOR THOSE THAT HAVE HAD TO LIVE WITH THIS. IT CAN'T JUST BE ANOTHER DAY. IT CAN'T JUST BE THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN. AND IT CAN'T BE BROKEN PROMISES SO I WOULD ASK FOR FOR YOU IN YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS TO HELP US. TO WORK WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE TEAM AND WITH OUR PROFESSIONALS ALSO. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEN -- ALSO OUR OUR PUBLIC WORKS TECHNICAL EXPERTISE WE WILL MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO YOU AND TO DTS SEE. TO SEE HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE AND HELP TO EXPEDITE THIS PROJECT. IN WAR -- NOT MORE I WANT TO SAY IN A FASTER MANNER IN WAITING TO HEAR THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN. IN MAYBE THREE TO FIVE YEARS BECAUSE EVEN THAT IS A TICKING TIME BOMB FOR OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERVISOR. LISTENING TO YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF SENSE YOU'RE PART OF ENTHUSIASM. OF AND I KNOW YOU'RE BEING PRESUMPTUOUS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE NEXT ELECTION. BUT WE WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT TO THAT NEXT GOVERNOR MIGHT BE FOR SURE -- WE HAVE -- WITH US NOW DIRECTOR OF BARBARA FERRER FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND TO ALSO DOCTOR ADAM LOVE WHO APPARENTLY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A CARD. FORM SO WE'LL ASK YOU TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF. YOUR TIME COMES THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND I WANT THAT ALSO THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR SPENDING THE DAY HERE. IN THIS COMMUNITY AND REALLY HELPING US UNDERSTAND HOW IS THAT FOLKS IN GOVERNMENT WE CAN REALLY BRING EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO BEAR ON MAKING SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE LIVING HERE. HAVE WHAT THEY NEED IMMEDIATELY I'M I ALSO -- I KNOW THAT -- YOU HAVE THAT. MANY OF YOU GROWN WEARY -- I KNOW YOUR TIRED OF OUR MEETINGS -- AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO THE BOTH LAND YOUR VOICE -- AND YOUR COUNSEL -- TO WHAT'S NEEDED -- TO IN FACT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S JUSTICE -- THAT'S DONE HERE SO I WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE STILL HERE -- AND PLEDGE OUR COMMITMENT. TO REALLY SUPPORTING A YOUR NEEDS -- AS YOU MAKE SURE THERE'S A A RETURN HOUSE. FOR THIS COMMUNITY. ON AS SUPERVISOR AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK SUPERVISOR SOTHESE -- WHO HAS REALLY CHAMPIONED THE ISSUE? OF FOR THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING EXCITED ON THE PRINCIPAL. THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO LIVES HERE IS ENTITLED TO ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND I I AM SO THRILLED THAT. IN AN HONORED THAT I'M WORKING. FOR HER. BECAUSE SHE'S LEADING BY EXAMPLE EVERYDAY SO THANK YOU SUPERVISORS POLICE -- I WANNA -- SORT OF START BY SAYING IT AS THE SUPERVISOR NOTED. ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN FACT THE ENTIRE COUNTY FAMILY AND WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS OF THAT COUNTY FAMILY HERE TONIGHT. US STAND TOGETHER WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO URGE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE TAKEN. THERE'S A RAPID AND THOROUGH CLEANUP. OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN THE ENTIRE. SURROUNDING THE EXITE BATTERY PLANT. THIS INCLUDES OUTSIDE OF HOMES. INSIDE OF HOMES AND IN PART WAYS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAND WITH YOU AND YOUR NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO ACCURATE INFORMATION. ABOUT THE CLEAN UP PROCESS AND THAT THE RISKS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO CONTAMINATION FROM THE EXIDE BATTERY PLANT. AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CARE AND SERVICES. ARE THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS YOUR CURRENT HEALTH NEEDS AND YOUR FUTURE HEALTH NEEDS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE RESOLVED. OF EXPOSURES TO KNOWN CARCINOGENS AND LET. ARE CLEANING UP FROM THE LARGEST LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE. AND SWIFT ACTION. FOR OVER THREE DECADES EXCITE OPERATED WITHOUT THE NECESSARY STATE PERMITS RELEASING LEAD. BENZENE AND ARSENIC INTO THE SURROUNDING RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. FOR DECADES RESIDENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES WERE EXPOSED TO KNOWN HUMAN CARCINOGENS. AND THESE CARRY WITH THEM AN ELEVATED RISK OF CANCER. WELL WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT EXTENT OF THESE EXPOSURES. WE DO KNOW THAT LEAD CONTAMINATION ON THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTIAL LOTS. HAS PERSISTED FOR DECADES. RESIDENTS CURRENTLY FACE A CONTINUING RISK OF TOXIC EXPOSURE TO LEAD CONTAMINATED SOILS ON THEIR OWN PARKWAYS AND PROPERTIES. THIS EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO LEAD POISONING WHICH AFFECTS THE BRAIN KIDNEYS LIVER AND OTHER ORGANS. HAS BEEN NOTED BY EVERY SPEAKER YOUNG CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN ARE ELEVATED RISK. AND CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING. FROM EITHER INGESTING OR BREATHING LEAD FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL IN YARDS AND THE LEAD DUST INSIDE THEIR HOMES. CAN EXPERIENCE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY CAN BE BORN PREMATURELY. THEY CAN EXPERIENCE GROSS IMPAIRMENT AND LEARNING AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS PREGNANT WOMEN ARE AT RISK OF BOTH PREMATURE BIRTH. AND MISCARRIAGE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EMERGENCY EMERGING RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD EXPOSURE. FOR CHILDREN. BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD ASK US TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT THE CSC PROVIDED TONIGHT THEY'RE ESTIMATING THAT IT COSTS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER HOUSE PER PARCEL. TO DO THE CLEANUP AND THAT THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. THAT LIVE IN THE AREA THAT WAS CONTAMINATED. WHEN I DO THE MATH AND I'M NOT GREAT AT MATH BUT WHEN I DO HALF? THAT AMOUNTS TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A PERSON. WHO'S BEEN EXPOSED OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS TOO EXTENSIVE TOXINS. I THINK WE OWE IT TO EVERY RESIDENT THAT'S LIVING HERE TO FIND THE MONEY FOR THE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT IT WILL TAKE TO CLEAN UP EVERY PROPERTY. OF THE TEN THOUSAND PARCELS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED ID TSC. AND I WOULD URGE US TO ALSO PUT ALL OF OUR BRAIN POWER TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT ARE IN THIS ROOM. AND FIGURE OUT AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO DO THIS CLEAN UP. WHEN I DO THE CALCULATIONS? FOR TEN AND I CALCULATE AT THE HIGHEST RATE OF TWENTY FIVE PARCELS A WEEK IT WILL TAKE SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO BE CLEANED UP. AND THAT WILL TAKE TOO LONG. I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH FOLKS AND ENOUGH PEOPLE POWER IN THIS ROOM. TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IN FACT EXPEDITE A CLEANUP PROCESS. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT AND PROVIDE REQUESTED SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SURROUNDING THE FORMER ACCENT PLANT. I'VE GIVEN THE SERIOUS RISKS ARE THE COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO YOUR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND I WANNA THANK THE SUPERVISOR. ANDMY SISTER AGENCIES OF BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO OPEN UP A NEW CLINIC IN THIS AREA BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BRINGING SERVICES TO YOU. IN YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP WERE HERE TONIGHT I WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW -- WE WILL DRY NAME ANY LEAD LEVELS HERE -- SO IF YOU NEED TO GET YOUR BLOOD LEVEL TESTED WERE IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR. ON AND YOU KNOW YOU JUST NEED TO LET US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT A BARRIER TO GETTING TESTED IS NOT THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO ONE OF OUR CLINICS WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING SERVICES. OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY OUT WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO STAND WITH YOU. AND LOOK AT PROCESS SEES THAT WOULD HELP MAKE THIS CLEAN UP -- BEARABLE AN EXPEDITED. SO WE'RE ANXIOUS TO BE HERE LISTENING TO YOU TONIGHT BUT ALSO AT ALL YOUR OTHER COMMUNITY MEETING SO THAT WE CAN SOLICIT YOUR IDEAS. OF WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE OUTSIDE OF HOMES ABLE TO BE CLEANED BUT WE WORRY A LOT ABOUT THE INSIDE OF HOMES. THERE'S NO WAY THAT OVER THIRTY THREE YEARS DUST FROM CONTAMINATED YARDS AND PARKWAYS HAS NOT ENTERED INTO THE HOMES. AND I DON'T WANT ANY OF US TO FEEL SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT -- BECAUSE OUR HOUSES WEREN'T SELECTED WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. WITH THE IMMEDIATE THE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES FROM LEAD POISONING. WE DO THE THRESHOLD OF FOUR HUNDRED OF FOUR HUNDRED OF PARTS PER MILLION. IS IS A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF THE VERY HIGH THRESHOLD. OKAY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN. SO IF YOUR HOME IS NOT BEING CLEANED UP IN THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES. I URGE YOU TO STILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US AND TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO THE SOIL. IT IS NOT SAFE EVEN LOW FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION -- SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AGAIN AS WE CONTINUE TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE STRATEGIES FOR REMEDIATING QUICKLY. TO ABSOLUTELY MINIMISE THE EXPOSURE TO LEAD THAT EXISTS IN THIS COMMUNITY. ON SO I I WANT TO JUST CLOSE BY THANKING EVERYONE I I WANT TO THANK OUR STATE PARTNERS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT ARE HERE TONIGHT -- FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO. WHICH IS TO DO WHAT GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO DO WHICH IS STEP IN WHEN OTHERS HAVE STEPPED OUT SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU GO AND TALK A LOT. RIGHT OF MY NAME'S ADAM LOVE AMONG OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT TO THE COUNTY OF LA AND ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS EXPERT. OFF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT SITE NOW FOR OVER FOUR YEARS -- AND AS WE ALL KNOW IT HAS EVOLVED QUITE A BIT OVER THAT TIME -- MY ROLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN JUST TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTY. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THE DECISION MAKING IS BASED ON SOUND SCIENCE. AND THAT WERE PRACTICAL ABOUT OUR APPROACH TO IT TO GOING ABOUT WITH INVESTIGATION REMEDIATION SOLUTIONS AND SO. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS THIS HAS INVOLVED -- THAT'S BEEN MY ROLE IS TO BE SHARES FOR WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED ODD TO REALLY COME IN AND SAY IS THERE ANOTHER WAY IS THERE A BETTER WAY. ARM AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OTHER THAN THAT -- REAL AGAIN I'M UP HERE PRIMARILY AS A RESOURCE TO THE QUESTIONS THAT COME ACROSS THAT ARE REALLY TECHNICAL RIGHT BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THEY CAN BE A LOT OF SORT OF DOUBLE SPEAKING GOBBLEDYGOOK THAT GETS HIDDEN IN THE WAY THAT THE NUMBERS ARE PRESENTED. AND HOW THEY'RE DISCUSSED AND TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS HOW TO SNIFF THAT OUT. AND KNOW WHAT A WAY TO EXPLAIN A WAY THAT EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND. UP THAT'S REALLY WHY I'M HERE RIGHT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACING. DOESN'T GET DELIVERED. BY THE ABILITY TO SORT OF MANIPULATE NUMBERS OR MANIPULATE THE PRESENTATION. IN A WAY THAT THAT REALLY ALLOWS THE TRUTH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND SUPERVISORS POLICE. GOT SOME CLOTHES AND COME YES I'M I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ALSO THINK OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN. HELPING US MOVE OF THE AGENDA LONG I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK OUR COUNTY COUNCIL WHO IS ALSO HERE. ON THAT RECENTLY AS OF YESTERDAY HELP TO WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT REGARDING SO THAT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY SETTLEMENT. FOR LISA CANYON -- REMARKABLY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL ALONG WITH OUR OFFICES WERE ABLE. TO RECEIVE OR AT LEAST WORK TOWARDS A FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR LEAD PAINT CLEAN UP. FOR THE INSIDE OF THE RESIDENCE IS NEAR EXCITE OR IN EXILE I DO WANT TO MENTION ALSO THAT WE HAVE ALSO SECURED. THROUGH OUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT A THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FINE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. TO CONTINUE INTERIOR CLEAN UP SO I WANTED TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME BACK. NOISE THAT THE COUNTY HASN'T. AND INITIALLY WHEN WE STARTED WHEN I FIRST TOOK OFFICE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I ASKED ASKED WAS OUR STAFF. TO COME TOGETHER SO WE COULD DO SOME TESTING WE IMMEDIATELY PUT OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT WE COULD TEST AT A FASTER RATE. THAN THE STATE COULD AND I'M GLAD THAT WHAT WE LEARN FROM THAT DTS C. HAS. HAS LOOKED AT THAT WE WANT TO BE HELPFUL WE WANT TO PROVIDE WHATEVER EXPERTISE WE CAN WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER I THINK WE CAN SOLVE. A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK -- MS GARCIA HAS A QUESTION TO BE. I DO YOU -- THIS PRAYER YOU SPOKE ABOUT THIS FALSE SENSE OF WE ARE SAFE IF IT'S FOUR HUNDRED FOUR FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAME WAY. YOU KNOW WE KEEP REFERRING TO THE CHILDREN AND INTO THE PREGNANT MOTHERS OUT THERE -- BUT I MEAN I I THINK AND ALONG THAT VEIN. WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE ARE THEY SAFE AND? WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTINUED EXPOSURE I IT'S THE THIRTY YEARS PLUS? YOU KNOW THE SIX YEARS THAT THIS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ENGAGED AND THEN WE'LL REPORT POSSIBLY ANOTHER SEVEN YEARS IF EVER THERE JUST WITH THE CLEAN UP AT LEAST A TEN THOUSAND MEAN I'D LIKE. TO INVITE A DOCTOR OF RAG AND TO COME UP ON HIS OUR TOXICOLOGIST. HOME AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A QUESTION OF THAT OF REALLY DEMAND SORT OF A VERY CONCISE KNOW AROUND THE TOXICOLOGY LAB DOCTOR MAYBE YOU CAN USE THE MICROPHONE THAT DON'T. AT THE LECTERN [inaudible] YEAH. YEAH IT'S NOT MY CAR. YEAH THANK YOU [inaudible] TEST TEST [inaudible] SO THE THE QUESTION ABOUT ONGOING OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN THE SITUATION AS IT IS IS QUITE A COMPLEX ONE BUT I'LL TRY TO CLARIFY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT? THE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF LEAD THAT WE HAVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S IT'S REALLY QUITE -- QUITE A WIDE ARRAY AND WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT LEG PAIN IS BEING THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE FOR MOST PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THAT STILL HOLDS TRUE TODAY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE HOWEVER IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT SITUATION? YES THERE ARE A LOT OF HOMES THERE THAT MAY HAVE LEAD PAINT. THERE'S ALSO A NUMBER OF HOMES THAT HAVE LIKE CONTAMINATION IN THE SOIL SEMI CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN DEPOSITED IN THAT SOIL. ACTUALLY NOT JUST FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS BUT FOR THE PAST. EIGHTY OR NINETY YEARS THAT THAT THAT PLAN ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IN OPERATION JUST EXCITED TO HAVE A PERMIT FOR THIRTY YEARS BUT HE'S REALLY BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL MORE DCADES BEFORE THAT. AND THE MISSIONS THAT WERE GOING ON IN THOSE PREVIOUS YEARS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THOSE LEVELS OF EMISSIONS WERE AND WHAT THE EXPOSURES MAY HAVE BEEN FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED HERE. ALL THOSE SEVERAL DECADES SO RIGHT NOW IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY QUANTIFY. AND DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE'S EXPOSURES MAY HAVE BEEN. THAT BEING SAID WHEN WE LOOK TODAY. IT'S A BIG MYSTERY BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE LIKE LIKE PAINT. WE CAN LOOK AT THE LEAD PAINT AND WE CAN TAKE MEASURES THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PREVENT EXPOSURES TO LEAD PAINT INSIDE A HOME AND WE'VE GOT PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS FOR THAT. AND THEY WORK. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO LETTING YOUR SOIL. IT'S A BIG MYSTERY HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILD IS PLAYING HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE HOT SPOT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY IN THAT SPOT TODAY OR TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY AND HOW MUCH LATER THE REALLY NTERESTING. IT'S REALLY A GIANT QUESTION MARK AND WHEN WE GO AND SAMPLE THESE LOCATIONS ALL OVER THE COMMUNITY WE MAY FIND A HOT SPOT IN ONE HOME. WE MAY FIND THAT THERE'S NOT A HOT SPOT ANOTHER HOME BUT THAT HOME THAT WE DIDN'T FIND A HOT SPOT. MAY HAVE SEVERAL HOT SPOTS AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NOTION THAT IF YOU FIND A HOT SPOT IN ONE PROPERTY. THAT YOU MAY ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION IN THE NEXT PROPERTY. EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY FIND IT WITH YOUR SAMPLING. SO WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE ONE HOUSEHOLD NEEDS TO BE CLEAN THE NEXT HOME ISN'T ON THE LIST BUT THE HOME RIGHT NEXT TO THAT IS ON THE LIST. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO TAKE A MUCH MORE BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BECAUSE EVERYONE IS EXPOSED TO ALL THE LIGHT IT'S NOT JUST ON YOUR PROPERTY OR JUST ON THE PARKWAY THAT MIGHT BE FROM YOUR HOUSE IT'S EVERYONE EXPOSED TO ALL THE LEAD. SO WE NEED TO TAKE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BECAUSE WE CAN'T QUANTIFY WHAT THAT EXPOSURES GOING TO BE FOR THIS COMMUNITY. BUT WE ARE ALL THAT RACE ANYWHERE IN THIS COMMUNITY NOT JUST CHILDREN AND MOTHERS. ABSOLUTELY ANY ALL ALL THE POPULATIONS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE HIGHEST RISK. IN GENERAL WE WE SAY ARE THE MOTHERS MOTHERS OF CHILDBEARING AGE IN THE CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY EVERYBODY IS AT RISK AND AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE END THAT HOLISTIC FASHION. I ASKED THAT QUESTION I KNEW THE ANSWER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG THAT WE'RE STARTING TO NORMAL LIFE. WAS STARTING TO CHANGE OUR EXPECTATION EVER SINCE THEY ALL WELL I'M NOT AT A THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION I'M ONLY A FOUR HUNDRED TOM OKAY BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE ALL WHILE I'M NOT PREGNANT I DON'T HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD FROM. EVEN THE ONES THAT -- GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST. TOLD ME WHICH I JUST LEARNED SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YES EVEN THOUGH THE WHITE% HOUSE OVER MIGHT NOT BE TESTING THAT THAT THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION. I MEAN IT TO THEIRS OUT AT IT IS THAT WE'RE ALL EXPOSED. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE KEEP SPENDING MONEY IN THE IN THE IN THE PROCESS WITH TESTING. WHEN WE TAKE LESS IT'S CLEAN IT UP? I WELL THE SCHOOL WHILE YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE PLAIN IN THAT PARK WHERE I WAS LIKE WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD I WAS PLAYING AND AND THE PARKWAY FLASHES THE SIDEWALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE. KIDS CALL IT WHAT IT IS I WOULD PLAY THAT'S I LOOK IN THE TOOLS AND THE TIME WALKING THE SAME WAY I WOULD BE DIGGING HOLES IN THE BACK OF OUR HOUSE. AND YEAH MY MOM WOULD PREFER I DIDN'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE WHAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP AN EYE ON ME ALL THE TIME AND SO I THINK. WE THEY ARE ALL DOES THIS IMPORTANT AND GIVEN THE SIGNS THAT AN EXPERT IS TELLING THEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WE KEEP SAYING WE NEED TO TEST AND IF THAT'S THE PROCESS THEN LET'S CHANGE THE PROFIT THEY THINK LEVEL THIS TELL THE TSC? AT THEY COULD SKIP THAT STEP OFF AND MAKE THOSE AS YOU MAY THINK THEY'LL EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. ON IT AT ALL APPROPRIATE OR MONEY INTO A MUCH BETTER PLACE. THINKING. I'M IN MY SECOND QUESTION IS -- WE KNOW ABOUT EXIDE WE NOBODY EVEN THOSE YOU KNOW. WILL PASS AND THE CANDY WITH SOMEBODY NOW AND THEN THAT THEY HAVE LED TO I MEAN I THOUGHT BEING THOSE -- AWHILE AGO I EGG BUT EXCITED WITH BRINGING US INTO THE CLINIC EXACTLY THREE UNITS TO A HEARING LIKE THIS. WHAT IS? YOU GUYS ON THE GROUND IN THE COUNTY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP EDUCATE THE FOLKS ABOUT ALL THE OTHER EXPOSURES TO LET OUR OTHER THINGS AND AND HOW HE COULD. BE BETTER BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST EXCITED THAT'S BECAUSE ME WELL YOU KNOW WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S ACCOUNTABLE WOULD WE TRIED FOR THE CLEAN UP AND I WAS LIKE WELL I DON'T HAVE THIRTY YEARS THAT CATHOLIC PEOPLE KEEPING SICK BUT ARE YOU TAKING OPPORTUNITIES. I AM IN THIS HOUR WE TAKE YOUR DOING TO DO THE DIGITAL TEST -- EDUCATION AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE. ARE JUST HOLD PEOPLE AND THEY NEED ALL OF THEIR NEEDS ADDRESSED IN ONE OF THE THINGS THE COUNTY FAMILY TRIES TO DO IS. MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU KNOW WE STILL OUT IN YOUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY WE HAVE A TEAM WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE. AND OFTEN A HEALTH EDUCATOR THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND GOING DOOR TO DOOR STILL TO TALK WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS BUT IT'S ABOUT YOUR BROADER CONCERNS ARE. SOME OF WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED. TO THE EXPOSURES YOU'VE EXPERIENCED FROM THE X. I. CONTAMINATION SOME OF WHICH MAY BE RELATED TO NOT BEING WELL CONNECTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT YOU NEED. A THIRD AREA WHERE WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO REALLY HELP IS TO MAKE SURE THE PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT THEY TOO ARE SENSITIVE TO THE EXTRA SCREENINGS THAT YOU MAY NEED. AN EXTRA TESTING THAT YOU MAY NEED TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE RISKS OF EXPOSURES ARE TRANSLATING INTO A MEDIA. OR FUTURE HEALTH NEEDS HOW WE'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO CONNECT MORE KLUM. CONNECT MORE APPROPRIATELY WITH THE SCHOOLS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD SO THAT THE SCHOOLS ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXPOSURE TO LEAD MAY DO FOR CHILDREN'S LEARNING AND HOW TO BEST MAKE SURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT AT SCHOOL SUPPORT ALL CHILDREN LEARNING. AND GIVE REALLY GOOD ACCESS TO BOTH THE SCREENING THAT CHILDREN NEED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLYTHE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S NEEDED. FOR CHILDREN TO FLOURISH AND LEARN -- SO WE YOU KNOW THIS IS FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM YOU ABOUT A WHOLE HOST OF SERVICES THAT YOU'D LIKE US TO DO AND YOU KNOW GET A SUPERVISOR SO HE SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S A LARGE COUNTY FAMILY HERE -- AND WE'RE AT YOUR SERVICE -- IT'S OUR JOB AND AND WE WANT TO DO IT WELL AND FOR FALLING SHORT WE'RE ALWAYS ANXIOUS WE COULD BE DOING. TO SUPPORT YOUR NEEDS IT REALLY IS A NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE RESOURCES YOU NEED. TO FOR OPTIMAL WELL BEING TO BE AS HEALTHY AND WELL AS POSSIBLE. GUESS MY QUESTION IS MORE SPECIFIC FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T ADD AND THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BUT TODAY THEY TALK ABOUT OUR PETS AND AND WHEN WE THINK THAT YOU THINK ARE MY PETS BEING SICK. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO HIGH I HAVE FOUR KIDS OF MY OWN BUT THE BIGGER CONNECTION OF YOUR PETS ARE TRACKING IN THE DIRT WITH THE LEAD INTO YOUR HOUSE ON A REGULAR BASIS. I DON'T THINK I HADN'T GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT ARE YOU WHEN US WE ARE WE ACTUALLY TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT MITIGATION. WELL I OTHER FOLKS LRIGHT SO AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SAYING AND I WANT PEOPLE TO BE AWARE LIKE THE MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SO WHAT WHAT TO DO IF YOU LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD NOW. TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE INCLUDES SORT OF WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT. MAKING SURE YOUR SHOES ARE NOT OUTDOOR SHOES ARE NOT WORN INDOORS THAT THEY'RE TAKEN OFF DUSTING OFF THE THE FEET OF YOUR PATHS. ARE WHEN THEY COME IN SO THAT THEY'RE NOT TRACKING IN A LEAD US WHILE WE TALK WITH FOLKS ABOUT WAYS TO KEEP THE HOUSE CLEAN. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND TELL YOU TO CLOSE YOUR WINDOWS AND YOUR DOORS -- IN IN THIS HEAT THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE REQUEST BUT WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU OTHER WAYS TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURES WE'VE TALKED A LOT WITH PEOPLE ABOUT NOT GROWING VEGETABLES -- IN THEIR GARDENS ON BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASSURE THE SAFETY OF A YOU KNOW THAT SYMBOLS THAT ARE GROWN IN SOIL THAT'S CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD. ON SO I I THINK AGAIN ON AND A BIG SHOUT OUT TO THE TEAM OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES THAT DO GO DOOR TO DOOR. ON AND TRY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AS WELL AS THE FOLKS THAT ARE AT YOUR HEALTH FAIRS ETCETERA TO TRY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLEDO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY. OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY AND I LEFT BY NOW AND OUR TEAM SPEAK SPANISH. HOME SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN A LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND IN THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT WE'RE HERE. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND IF WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO HELP FIND THE ANSWERS FOR YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. I AM I GUESS I JUST HAVE A COMMENT ON THE TESTING -- IN IN THINKING ABOUT RECOVERY [inaudible] SO. THE ORIGINAL MONEY THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THE CLEANING TO DO THE TESTING AND THE CLEAN UP. IS TO HAVE A GUARANTEE FROM EXIDE. THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS MONEY BACK. AND SO WHILE IT IS. WELL IT IS -- INCREDIBLY TIME CHALLENGING. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO HOLD EXCITE ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT NOW. THE MONEY APPROPRIATED AS TAXPAYERS DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT A CORPORATION DID TO HARM OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO WE WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. IN IN A WAY THAT'S PRODUCTIVE IN A WAY THAT HOLD EXCITE ACCOUNTABLE IN A WAY THAT WE THE TAXPAYER. GET THIS MONEY BACK FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SO RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS PUTTING IT UP I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE COUNTY HAS. ALSO ALLOCATED FUNDS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP ON ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT FROM THE CITY COUNCILS IN THE SMALLER CITIES CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE COUNTY THE STATE OF OUR NEW POTENTIAL GOVERNOR GETTING INVOLVED. IN ENSURING THAT THIS CLEAN UP THIS EXPEDITED. BUT WHILE THERE ARE FRUSTRATIONS THERE ARE ALSO THE REALITIES. OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS MONEY BACK. MISTER SANTIAGO SHIP OF ONE I THINK -- CALIBER SUPERVISOR ON POLICE. UP FOR HARD WORK AND HER TEAM AT THE COUNTY FAMILY AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES TO CONTINUE COLLABORATING. AND MAYBE DOING MORE GOOD LOOK WE'VE HAD TTC IS OUTLINED A CHALLENGE -- TO GETTING THE AGREEMENTS -- THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT MAYBE THERE'S ALWAYS THERE THAT THE COUNTY CAN HELP WITH. IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE PROPERTY AGREEMENTS TO CLEAN UP WHEN YOU'RE WALKERS ARE OUT THERE AND IT'S AN EFFECTIVE TOOL AND I THINK IT I THINK IT TAKES ON IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO GRASP THE FULL BREADTH. OF THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO POTENTIALLY PARTICIPATE AT THAT LEVEL BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER GAPS. OTHER BEEN OUTLINED AT THE WITHERS FURTHER COLLABORATION TO ATTACK SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS. AND AS I'M HERE TALKING YOU TALKING I THINK WE HAVE A WE HAVE A CHALLENGE NOT NONE THE LESS TO CLEAN THIS UP AND I BUT THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE IT TO ADD VALUE TO WHAT WE DO WHEN WE STEPPED IN FRONT OF SOME. A NEIGHBOR -- THERE MAY BE MAD AT CAL -- FORMS -- AND THERE MAY BE -- I HSS OPPORTUNITIES OR MAYBE ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE MAY PART OF THAT -- CONSTITUENT -- EIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I THINK OUTSIDE OF THIS CONVERSATION MAY WE CAN CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO BRAINSTORM A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT WE'VE GOT AT THE STATE WHAT YOU'VE GOT AT THE COUNTY. TO TRY TO MAKE RESIDENTS OF HOLE WHERE IT WERE A GOVERNMENT THAT PASSES FILL THEM AND SO THANK YOU ONCE ONCE AGAIN. FOR YOUR COLLABORATION. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. AND I AM NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU OF I THINK THAT OUR ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW IS TO GET OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND. WE HAVE A SLEW OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH THEY'RE KNOWN AS PROMISED ON US. THEIR HEALTH NAVIGATORS THEY GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE ALSO HERE TODAY -- GIVING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE EXPOSED TO LEAD POISONING. EXIDE WITH SOME OF THE SIGNS ARE WHERE AND WE'VE HAD TEAMS GO OUT PERIODICALLY AND AS YOU HEARD FROM OUR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUNICATION HAS TO HAPPEN ONE ON ONE IT CAN'T BE THROUGH A FLYER YOU CAN'T JUST BE GOING ON A PORTAL IT HAS TO BE MORE THAN THAT FOR THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY ARE CHALLENGED. AND THEY DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE REMEDIES JUST TWO DAYS WHEN WE HEARD WHEN WE ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT IF YOUR SOIL IS GOING TO BE CLEANED UP AROUND YOUR HOUSE. AND THE HOMEOWNER SAYS WELL I DON'T WANT YOU TO TOUCH MY TREAT. BUT THAT TREE IS IMPACTED BY THE SAME LEVEL OF POISONING LEAD POISONING AND THE HOUSEHOLD ORDER OR TEN IT DOESN'T REALIZE. THAT IF THEY DON'T REMOVE THAT TREE THERE ISSTILL GOING TO BE A LEVEL OF LET THAT IS STILL POISONOUS AND TOXIC WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER. COMMUNICATION PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT INFORMATION TO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN A LANGUAGE AND IN A CULTURALLY COMPETENT MANNER SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE CHOICES HERE. AND FURTHER MORE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THEIR HOMES CLEAN. IN THE INTERIOR THE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WON'T BE INCONVENIENCED SO WE COULD TAKE THEM AS AS WAS SAID BY DTS SEE ON THE GROUND. THE PEOPLE COULD STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE WHY THAT REMEDIATION GOES ON AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY DID YOU KNOW LISA CANYON. THEY ALLOWED FOR PEOPLE TO GO STAY IN OTHER PLACES WHILE THE REMEDIATION OCCURRED. I DON'T SEE WHY. WE HAVE TO TOTALLY BE TREATED IN SUCH A DIFFERENT MANNER IT'S ABOUT EXPLAINING ON A VERY BASIC AND HUMAN LEVEL. AND I THINK WE'RE WE FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO TO HELP THEM DO THAT WITH WITH THE STATE AND WITH THE TSC AND WITH OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE COUNTY AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PATCHWORK OF JURISDICTIONS OUT HERE -- AND I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING OWNERS OF PROPERTY TO HAVE TEN AND I WHO ARE NOT SIGNING THOSE AGREEMENTS TO COME IN AND DO THE CLEANUP I I THINK. WE GOT TO THE FIRST VERY ARE COMMITTING A LOT AND AND WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO ALL OF THEM BUT THAT WASN'T THERE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF DOOR KNOCKING WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO BUT NOW ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THEM TO CALL US BACK AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAD THESE LEVELS TO LET US IN TO CLEAN UP. THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE HESITANT TO LET GOVERNMENT INTO. THEIR BACKYARDS FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE INTO THEIR HOMES AND THEIR PROPERTIES. AND SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH CLINTON FOR SPENT -- AND SO DO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE THINGS ARE THE I MEAN. WHETHER. I WON PLACES UP TO CODE WHAT I ULTIMATELY IN ONE PLACE IS CLEAN RIGHT NOW FIRST AND FOREMOST -- AND SO. WHEN I'VE TALKED TO THE FOLKS ARE LIKE WELL I'M NOT TAKING THERE IS AND I TALKED TO SOME FOLKS LIKE HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING TO YOUR PROPERTY LIKE NO BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I BROUGHT IT UP TO PUT EITHER? AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THE RISK RIGHT NOW -- AND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENS I MEAN WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT DO THIS QUITE A FORCE FOR THE FOR SOME PART OF IT AS A SECURITY THAT NONE OF THAT'S GONNA. COME INTO PLAY IN WHICH IS GOING TO CLEAN AND WELL I WOULD. I MEAN I I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS HERE. WE DO SO WE CAN HAVE SOMEONE PLEASE COME UP. BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE. ASKED ALSO IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING. IT MAY NOT LIVE IN THIS AREA BUT WE ONLY HAVE TWO AND I THINK OUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS CAN BE HELPFUL. IN FINDING OUT WHO OWNS THE DEED WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY AND THEN CONTACTING THEM BUT DOING A COLLABORATIVE LEAVE WITH. THE TSC BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE TAX ROLLS WE DO HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AND NO ONE CAN WORK COLLABORATIVE I BELIEVE ON THAT ISSUE. WHEN YOU'VE DONE SOME CONTRACT% AND THEN THEY STILL LET YOU AND? I YOU KNOW AND SO I GET THE PROPERTY RIGHTS BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE HESITATION. ON SO I DON'T KNOW THAT SOMETHING AND I KNOW AGAIN. IS A SPECIFIC ONLY TO THE UNINCORPORATED -- JURISDICTIONS I KNOW YOU TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. FOR THE COUNTY THAT'S CORRECT ONE MOTHER GONE. PUBLIC WORKS REALLY COUNTY. WE DON'T WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CLEAN UP IS A PRIORITY TO THE COUNTY TO OUR SUPERVISOR. SO WE WILL FOCUS ON THE CLEAN UP EFFORTS AS OPPOSED TO OUR COMMUNITY BEING AFRAID OF A PUBLIC WORKS GOING IN THERE. AND FIGHT IT IN FOR ME PERHAPS WE ASSURE THE COUNT THE DEPARTMENT. ALTHOUGH ALL THE COUNTY ALL PEOPLE HERE. THAT WE WILL FOCUS ON THE CLEAN UP EFFORT ON OUR SITE WE'RE DOING THE GRADING DRAINAGE REVIEW. OF EACH PROPERTY TO ENSURE THAT THE THE DRAINAGES PLAYS BACK PROPERLY. CONDITIONS THERE THAN IT WAS BEFORE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DRAINAGE IS -- IS PROPERLY TRAINED LIKE IT WAS BEFORE THAT IS OUR FOCUS AND WE WANT TO ASSURE THE PEOPLE HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT. I THINK ANY OF OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDER FROM OTHER CITIES DO WE COULD GIVE THAT ASSURANCE ENSURE THAT INFORMATION I DON'T THINK WILL CAPTURE EVERYONE BUT WILL CAPTURE A FEW MORE FOLKS TO LET US INTO THEIR INTO THEIR PROPERTY SO WE COULD TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE'S PUBLIC. OUT THERE TO HELP. YOU'RE WITHOUT RESPONSE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. TO A VERY MUCH THE PRESENTATION MADE QUESTION ANSWERED [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE A BREAK BETWEEN THESE TWO PANELS AND CAN WE GET SET UP FOR THE NEXT NOW VERY QUICKLY WE'LL ASK OUR SPEAKERS SO THESE ARE. THREE COMMUNITY STAKE. TO COME FORWARD YES. I HAVE. ONE LAST [inaudible] REALLY [inaudible] YEAH. ON IF YOU PARK. RIGHT [inaudible] SO. SOME OF THE OKAY THANK YOU. HERE FROM OUR AFRICAN UNITY STAKEHOLDERS NOW. AND THEN PROCEED TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU CULD TAKE YOUR SEATS AND IT LOOKS  E WAITING ON MONSIGNOR. LORETTA THAT I WILL INTRODUCE WILL BEGIN THEN -- WITHOUT FULLY PAID A DEAR A FOLLOWED BY JANE WILLIAMS. WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. THINK YOU [inaudible] OF MONSIGNOR. IS STEPPING FORWARD NOW. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR WELCOMING US -- INTO THIS WONDERFUL ALL. IT'S A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. TO ADDRESS US ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. YES I'M I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE BECAUSE I LIVE HERE ACTUALLY SO I'M VERY. FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN THE PASTOR HERE AND TONIGHT. A I I REALLY -- MAYBE MY SAY EVERYTHING I SAID HERE. AND TO SPEAK. HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED. BUT THERE IS ONE THING I WANT TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU AND I SHOULD WITH SOME OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS IT JUST HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND IT WAS A MEETING THAT FOUR OF US IN THE COMMUNITY WENT -- TO A RALLY -- FOR GAVIN NEWSOM OUT IN A VAN NUYS. AND HE HAD A QUESTION ANSWER THING. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS ABLE TO ASK HIM WAS ESTIMATES BUT DON'T REALIZE IT PUT EXCITE US GONNA BE SHOULD BE ON YOUR RADAR I WANT YOU NOT. TO TO FORGET THAT IT'S GONNA BE A PRIORITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FOR MY COMMUNITY AND I SHARED WITH HIM THE RESEARCH. THE DOCTOR JOE JOHNSON DIDN'T I JUST WISH YEAH. SHE STILL HERE IS THERE SHE IS RIGHT OVER THERE THE LADY SHE'S A REAL HERO. SHE WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS ABOUT THE RESEARCH AS HE HAD DONE. AND IT WE JUST RECEIVED THE RESULTS OF THE TIME. AND SO I SHARED WITH THIS COMMUNITY HERE MOSTLY ANGLE. I SAID TO THEM I SAID YOU KNOW I SAID. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT -- THE WOMEN THE COLLECTED TO STILL HAD THEIR THEIR CHILDREN'S BABY TEETH THEY THEY WERE PART OF THIS SURVEY. AND OUR BABIES TEASE WHEN THEY WERE TESTED AGAINST OF THE TWO OTHER SITES THAT OTHER PLACES. OF THE OTHER BABIES TEETH OUR BABY'S TEETH. DESPITE THE NAME OUT OF LEAD THAT WAS IN AN ALL BABIES TEETH SPIKED WITH THE LEAD. AND WHY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT IS BECAUSE THE REACTION NOT OF OF THE OF THE GATHERING NEWSOME. BUT IT WAS OF THE PEOPLE THERE MOSTLY ANGLO PEOPLE AS I SAID. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID THEY WENT THERE WAS AN AUDIBLE GROAN ALL. ONLY YOU COULD SEE EVERYBODY SAY THAT. HE REACTED LIKE PARENTS IN THIS EVERYBODY OF ALL. I'M PREACHING TO THE YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS WHO YOU KNOW IS YOU SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT IT TONIGHT. AND I JUST EMPHASIZE THAT EXPEDITIOUSLY IT QUICKLY -- IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS MORE THAN SIX YEARS NOW [inaudible] AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY HOMES IN SIX YEARS IS NOT A VERY GOOD RECORD. HOPEFULLY I WILL BE ABLE -- TO TO TO PROGRESS AND AND AND MAKE THAT AND I HOPE THAT THE THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS THE DECISION MAKERS THAT MOST OF YOU ARE HERE THIS PANEL. THAT A WILL ACT AS PARENTS AND TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE IT CLEANED UP RIGHT LIKE RIGHT NOW LIKE YESTERDAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MAN SEEN HERE THIS IS BY THE WAY THIS IS OUR LAST PANEL. AFTER THIS WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE COMMENT CARDS THAT ARE -- BEING FILLED OUT AROUND THE ROOM TO IT SO WE WILL. CONSIDER THOSE ALSO. AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS PANEL. AND THE NOW WE'LL MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR NEXT COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER PHILLY PAY AGAIN. YES WELL THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION FOR BEING HERE BY OUR LIVE AND WORK IN THE CITY OF MAYWOOD IT'S A LITTLE CITY HERE -- SOUTH OF THE OF THE US OF THE AREA BOYLE HEIGHTS. IN OUR COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS REALLY MY BY THIS -- COMPANY EXCITE. NOW ONE OF THE SPEAKERS BEFORE DOCTOR REGNANT SAID THAT THIS COMPANY HAD NOT BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS. EXCITED BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS WITH THIS COMPANY. THAT DOES LEAD BATTERY RECYCLING HAD BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY TWO TWO YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF MAY WOULD EVEN EXISTED. AS AN INCORPORATED CITY AND MANY OTHER CITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST MAYBE NOT LOS ANGELES. LOS ANGELES AROUND A BIT BEFORE. BUT THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT THIS COMPANY HAS DONE AND THE PREVIOUS COMPANY THAT WERE -- PROPRIETORS OF THIS PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY OF EXPOSING US TO LEAD. AND THE WAY THAT WE FOUND OUT WAS BECAUSE DTS HE HAD NOT DONE THEIR JOB. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF REGULATING THE EMISSIONS FROM THAT COMPANY IN REGULATING OTHER CLEAN ABOUT THAT PLACE EVEN GIVING THEM YOU KNOW TEMPORARY PERMITS. FOR THIRTY YEARS SO THIS IS HOW WE CAME TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT THIS COMPANY. BUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE AWHILE. AND IT'S NOT REALLY. TO BE POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE WAY THE OF THE CLEANUP. SUCH A HIGH AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION IT SEEMS THAT WE'RE INVITING SOMEONE INTO OUR HOME AND THEY COULD YOU HELP ME CLEAN UP MY PROPERTY CUT BECAUSE AT MY HOUSE. AND THE AGENCY IN CHARGE OF CLEANING JUST SAYS OKAY ROAD GOING TO CLEAN THE CLOSETS. WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THE LEAD EVERYWHERE ELSE. BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DGSE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING CLEANED UP THEY ARE GOING TO BE LET FREE. THEY MAY GIVE SOME GIFT CERTIFICATE BUT THEN THAT DOESN'T STAY IN THE GROUND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THE PARK RACE. THE LADIES IN THE WINDOW SILLS AND THAT IS INSIDE THE HOUSE IS THE LATEST FIGHT THE ADDICTS. SO JUST BECAUSE YOU FINISH A HOUSE IS NOT MEAN THAT HOUSES LET FREE. AND I THINK THERE WERE GIVING PEOPLE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY THING. OKAY HE LETTERS THE TAKING OUT OF YOUR YARD. THAT LEAD IS GONE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE WAY THAT. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING THIS CLEAN UP. IF YOU DON'T DO A CLEANUP BLOCK BY BLOCK YOU DON'T DO IN A MORE ORGANIZED WAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK. AND WE HAVE THAT THAT EXPERIENCE IN MAY WOULD. BECAUSE WE PARTICIPATE IN THE CLEAN UP OF A PLACE CALLED PEDICLE WITH THE CITY LATER BUILT A PARK. SO WE HAD A BATTLE WITH THE PAY FOR MANY YEARS IN THE PROCESS THE WAY THE CLEANUP THAT SITE. BUT THEY DID A VERY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF THE CLEAN UP. SO GUESS WHAT YEARS LATER IT'S COMING BACK. ALL THE CHEMICALS THAT WERE DOWN THERE BECAUSE EPA DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB OF CLEANUP NOW THEY'RE COMING BACK AND THE RE CONTAMINATED OUR COMMUNITY. SO IF YOU DO A CLEAN UP ONLY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND YOU DON'T CLEAN UP WHAT'S NEXT DOOR LIKE TO RECEIVE THE OTHER PROPERTIES. THAT ARE THERE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET RID OF THE LET. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE THE STATE IN TEN OR TWELVE YEARS WITH A CLEAR VICTORY SAID OKAY. WE'VE DONE THE JOB WE REMOVE THE LET BUT THE LEAD IS STILL THERE THE KIDS ARE STILL THERE THE PEOPLE ARE STILL THERE. AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. IN MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT THE PROPERTIES. THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE CLEANED UP ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE LA TIMES PUBLISHED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. SIXTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES IN THE TWO U. MAY WHAT WILL NOT BE CLEANED UP. IN ADDITION TO THE PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. IN COMMERCE IN BOYLE HEIGHTS. IS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PROPERTIES THAT WILL NOT EVEN BE I LIVE I FOUND A HIGH AMOUNT OF LET. AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORKS FOR THE AGENCY ASKED ME DID YOU ACTUALLY PUT OUT A LEAD BETTER YOU BACKYARD. YOU LEAVE A BARRIER YOU ARE A BETTER IN YOUR BACKYARD. HOW CAN YOU EVEN THINK OF THAT YOU KNOW WHY DOES IT HAVE A HIGH AMOUNT OF LEAD? IN IN THE BACKYARD AND NOT IN THE FRONT YARD. SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF SITUATION THAT WE SEE IT EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH THIS AGENCY AND WE HAVE REALISTIC COME TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE BEES PARTICIPATED IN. PANELS AND SESSIONS AT TESTIFYING AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT WE'RE NO CLOSER TO CLEAN UP THE SITUATION WE'RE NO CLOSER TO MAKING. OUR COMMUNITY HOLD AGAIN. WE JUST CANNOT COME AND SAY OKAY THE STATE HAS DONE THEIR DUE DILIGENCE WE CLEANED IT UP RECOVERED THE MONEY FROM EXCITE I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT AND THE BASICALLY SAYING THAT. THE COMMUNITY IS NOT CLEANED UP THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. I HAVE GOING ON TOURS NOT ANYBODY BY ANYBODY. BUT WE HAVE GONE ON THURSDAY NIGHTS HE CITES. IN MAY WHAT THAT WERE NOT BEING CLEANED UP ACCORDING TO ALL THE THE REGULATIONS THAT UP DTS HE GETS AS THAT WHICH I SAW KIDS RUNNING ON THE PHONE. OF THE YARD WHETHER CLEAN UP THE HOUSE OR CLEAN THE MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY. I SAW ANOTHER FLIGHT WITH THE WORKERS WERE NOW THE LEAD CONTAMINATION THEY'RE BEING TOLD TO DECONTAMINATE ONLY IF SOMEBODY FEELS THAT THEY SHOULD DO SO. THERE'S NOT REALLY A WAY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING THERE -- WE SAW OTHER PROPERTIES POSED TO YOU PACIFIC. WHERE THE DUST WAS FLYING TO THE OTHER NEIGHBORS HOUSES? BUT NOBODY BOTHERS TO TELL PEOPLE AND SAY YOU SHOULD NOT REALLY BE IN THERE OR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE EVACUATED. NOT GIVEN OUT OF A POSSIBILITY OF GOING TO A HOTEL MAYBE WANTED YOU TO TELL YOUR HUSBAND UP AS A SUPERVISOR SAID. BEING GIVEN A COUPON BUT YOU NEED A REAL COMPLETE CLEANUP AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS AGENCY. HAS THE ABILITY OR THE WILL TO DO IT. WE'RE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER. YOU CAN'T GO EVEN THOUGH DEVELOP A PLAN TO CLEAN UP TEN THOUSAND HOMES. WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THE AMOUNT OF ONE THAT REALLY ARE CONTAMINATED AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE CONTAMINATED CAN JUST BE CLEAN UP THE DIRT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE PEOPLE? AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING WE'RE NOT DOING THAT AND THE WAY I SEE THIS PLAN. IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO WORK FOR A COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR AND FINALLY. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM JANE WILLIAMS WALK -- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOM OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT BUT YOU SAID. THREE I'M JANE WILLIAMS I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS. AND WALL FATHER THIS IS HIS CHURCH AND WE'VE BEEN LIVES IN A WAY. THE ORGANIZATION AND THE DIRECTOR OF WAS ACTUALLY FOUNDED RIGHT HERE. IN THIS ROOM. IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE DID COMMENTS WITH YOU SIR UCLA ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CLINIC. MEMBERS OF THE MOTHERS OF EAST LA. AND SOME OTHER -- NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT HAVE WORKED IN A VERY REAL JUSTICE ISSUES IN LA. AND AT THAT TIME WE ASKED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO NOT REINSTATE -- EXISTING PERMITS TO TO GRANT EITHER FINAL PERMITS SO THAT WE COULD CHALLENGE THOSE IN COURT OR TO PULL THE PERMITS FOR THIS FACILITY. SO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT TIME WE HAVE WORKED ON THIS FACILITY. IT WAS FIRST STARTED IN. NINETEEN TWENTY TWO IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THERE WAS NO CLEAR OUT THERE WERE NO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL LAWS THERE WERE NO HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS. THAT INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES THAT -- WERE ALLOWED WERE VERY VERY DIRTY AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU CANNOT SEE THE PRESENTATION I HAVE OVER HERE. BECAUSE I HAVE FOUR SITES THE FIRST ONE IS -- NEAR THE CDC REPORT ON LAD STRESSES ONE THING. PRIMARY PREVENTION. REVENGE EXPOSURE BECAUSE ONCE EXPOSURE TO THIS CHEMICALOCCURS THE EFFECTS ARE IRREVERSIBLE. THIS IS A MAP OF THE X. I. FACILITY IN FRISCO TEXAS. AND I'M SORRY YOU GUYS CAN'T SEE IT MAYBE YOU CAN. THE PURPLE IS FIVE MILES. OKAY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF LEAD THE ONLY OPERATED FROM. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NOT FROM NINETEEN TWENTY TWO FROM. NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO TWENTY TEN IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THEY LOG THREE THOUSAND POUNDS OF WAS. IT'S A TWENTY FIVE SQUARE MILE AREA. IT'S BEEN CONTAMINATED. THIS IS A MAP OF THE OTHER GO SMELTERS THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE IS EXCITE. THOSE OTHER FIVE WHITE MARKS THAT YOU SEE OUR OTHER LEAD SMELTERSTHEY DIDN'T PERMITTED BY THE CITY OF LA. TO BE. IN EAST LA. AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS WE GET PAST THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILES AND WE KEEP GOING. WE'RE GONNA RUN INTO DEPOSITION FROM THESE OTHER SMELTERS. DOCTOR LIVES HERE HE CAN ATTEST TO WHAT THESE FALLOUT PATTERNS LOOK LIKE. OUR OTHER EXPERT DR WELLS HAS BEEN A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THIS. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO END UP BEING THE LARGEST LEAD CONTAMINATED SITE CLEANUP IN THE HEMISPHERE AND IT'S GONNA COST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. AND YET WE KEEP ASK WE KEEP ACTING LIKE. WE'RE JUST GONNA DO A HOUSE BY HOUSE. AS MANY ROLES IN. SO THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE BURGER SEE AND I WORKED ON THE BATTERY FEMALE. WE KNEW WE NEEDED A LONG TERM STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE LARGEST CLEAN UP SITES IN HISTORY THE COUNTRY. WE'VE GOT TO STOP ACTING LIKE WE CAN JUST GET IN AND GET OUT -- HERE'S THE CONCLUSIONS HERE'S WHAT WE NEED. FIRST OF ALL WE'VE GOT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE CLEANUP BREAK WE'VE GOT TO STOP START TALKING ABOUT THE POISONING RATE. BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WE POISON A CHILD A DAY. JUST IN THE ONE POINT SEVEN MILES. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN FRISCO TEXAS THAT NUMBER WOULD. RISE DRAMATICALLY OKAY. THERE IS NO MORAL CLARITY HERE ON WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY FACING. WE'RE FACING A LARGE SCALE POISONING EPIDEMIC. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND YOU STILL LAY IN PARTS OF SOUTH CENTRAL. AND IF I WAS GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE. AND TAKE YOUR CHILD OR YOUR CHILD OR YOUR CHILD OR YOUR CHILD AND POISON THEM IT WOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW. I'D BE ARRESTED I'D BE THROWN IN JAIL IT WOULD BE A MORAL STAIN. YET WE ARE ALLOWING THIS TO CONTINUE. AND WE'RE ALLOWING THE AGENCY THERE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM TO TRY AND CLEAN IT UP. PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS A SOCIOLOGICAL PROBLEM. WE HAVE AN AGENCY WHICH I PERSONALLY HAVE WORK WITH THIS AGENCY SINCE ITS CREATION IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO SINCE IT BECAME DGSE. A SEPARATE AGENCY KELLY EPA. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE LEVEL OF DYSFUNCTION THROUGH. COUNTLESS OTHER AND BILL SUE WHO WAS THE FIRST DIRECTOR OKAY. THROUGH COUNTLESS OTHER DIRECTORS REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS DOES IT WORK WITH DGSE REALIZE THEY ARE AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR DYSFUNCTION. OKAY IT'S IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL. WE'RE SO LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOMEBODY NEW HEAD THE AGENCY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO BUT IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US. WE'RE POISONING A CHILD TODAY. WE'RE POISONING A CHILD TODAY WE HAVE BABIES ARE BEING BORN PRE THEY ARE NOT ENDOWED WITH LIFE LIBERTY OR THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS THERE BUT WHEN THEY'RE BORN LEAD POISONED [inaudible] SO. WE NEED TO THINGS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WE NEED A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. WE NEED THE FULL BATTERY FEE REINSTATED. WE ORIGINALLY CREATED IT TO BE FIVE DOLLARS AND I SEE THAT MATT RODRIGUEZ IS HERE TONIGHT. I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING MISTER RODRIGUEZ. WHEN I PHONE YOU UP I HOPE YOU RETURN MY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE I CALLED YOU FOR A YEAR? ASKING YOU TO WORK WITH US ON THE BATTERY FEE AND WE GET TO THE VERY END OF THE SESSION. THE WEEK BEFORE AND IT TAKES THE SPEAKER AND THE PRO TEM GOING INTO THE GOVERNOR'S. HOUSE TO SAY I WANT THE BATTERY FEE. AND WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION DO THEY CUT IT IN HALF. AND THEN THEY SAY THEY HAVE THE GALL TO COME HERE THIS COMMUNITY AND TELL US. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. I MEAN I'M SORRY BUT I MEAN IT IS. IT IS IT IS ORWELLIAN. IT'S ORWELLIAN OKAY AND THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THIS ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW THAT. THAT ROAD REDUCES HERE AND GRANT IS HERE YOU'VE USE THIS COMMUNITY AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. TO AND YOU KNOW WHAT. AND I'M SORRY IF I PISS PEOPLE OFF BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE HAS THE COURAGE TO SAY IT. EAST LA IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO'S MATTED WHO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE KID THAT'S BEING BORN. BEING BORN IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT WILL NEVER HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY ARE LEAD POISONED THEY'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS A KID IS BORN ANY PLACE ELSE IN LA COUNTY. AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS AS THIS COMMUNITY OKAY. WE'VE GOT TO STAND UP ALL OF US WE'VE YELLED WE'VE SCREEN WE'VE BEEN TO HEARINGS WE FUSSED WE'VE BEEN ON BUSES WE HAVE GOT TO DO MORE. AND WE'VE GOT A YELLOW LAB ORDER. BECAUSE HOPE HAS TWO PARENTS. THOSE PARENTS HER COURAGE AND ACTION. AND WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW ADMINISTRATION. YOU KNOW THE SPEAKER IS STILL GOING TO BE HERE THESE FOLKS ARE STILL GOING TO BE REPRESENTING US AND WE HAVE GOT TO RAISE HOLY HELL BECAUSE IF NOT. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SENTENCE [inaudible] THESE CHILDREN. FUTURE GENERATIONS DECADES FROM NOW TO BE BORN WITHOUT LIFE LIBERTY OR THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THANK YOU. FOR THOSE COMMENTS. IF IT'S ALRIGHT I THINK WE'LL MOVE INTO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. AND JOHN WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND TO GET SET UP HERE IF YOU FILLED OUT A CARD. THAT'S GOING TO BE BROUGHT TO ME I THINK -- WAS ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY ALL READ THROUGH THOSE CARDS FIRST -- LAST THOSE FOLKS TO SPEAK WE WILL HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYBODY WHO HASN'T YET FILLED OUT A CARD TO FILL ONE NOW. OR JUST RAISE YOUR HAND YOU BE ABLE TO COME UP AND SPEAK OR WE CAN BRING THE MICROPHONE TO YOU IF IT'S DIFFICULT FOR YOU. TO GET GET TO THE MICROPHONE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TONIGHT AND IF YOU'RE HERE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE -- YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD RATHER THAN THEM COME FORWARD WITH YOU OB. I WHICH MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT LOGISTICALLY DIFFICULT IF YOU WANT TO ASK THEM TO STAND SO THAT THEY CAN BE ACKNOWLEDGED WE CAN DO THAT AS WELL. BUT IF WE COULD.

SO WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR BUT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE ARE THE LABORERS. BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK US SO YOU GUYS ARE IN CONSTRUCTION WOULD YOU GUYS DO YOU LIKE CHRISTIANS AND WE'RE LABORS. SOME LABORS TO CONCRETE BREAKING DEMOLITION CONCRETE. WE DO LET LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE CONSTRUCTION WHERE THE MINERS IN THE TUNNELS. WE DO EVERYTHING AS WE SAY THE STUFF NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO WERE MAJORITY LATINO IMMIGRANT POPULATION WHICH IS WHY WE LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND WE NEVER GET THE CREDIT WE DESERVE. ON TOP OF THAT WE DO THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK WHICH IS WHY WHEN THIS WHEN THIS PROJECT CAME FORWARD WE WANTED TO BE A PARTNER ON THIS WE WENT OUT TO OUR STATE LEGISLATORS AND SAID WE WANT TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK. WE ARE THE MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. THEY SHOULD BE HELPING TO CLEAN IT UP AND WE YOU PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND GIVING THEM CAREERS REAL CAREERS. GOOD PAYING JOBS WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND MEMBERS THAT DO ENVIRONMENTAL ALONG. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID AS EVERYTHING HAS HAS KIND OF GONE THROUGH. WE WON'T TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE LED TO THE DELAYS AND EVERYTHING WERE HERE NOW. AND WE'RE AT WE'RE AT WAR AT AND I HAVE TO COMMEND. EACH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HERE THAT FOUGHT HARD TO GET SOME SORT OF FUNDING TO GOING TO THIS COMMUNITY. AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT SUPERVISORS POLICE WORK HARD TO GET MONEY FROM THE COUNTY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE EVERYBODY SHOULD START WORKING TOGETHER. TO START FIXING THESE PROBLEMS WE CAN'T STOP AT THE YARDS CAN'T STOP AT THE PARK WAYS WE GOTTA START GETTING INTO THE HOUSES. TO AND WITH THAT. WE MADE A PROMISE THAT WE WERE GOING TO WORK THESE WITH THESE COMMUNITY MEMBER TO BRING THEM IN AND GET THE CAREERS AND I KNOW SEVERAL OF YOU GOT TO MEET ONE OF THEM. TODAY RAP A LOT. AND YOU CAN TELL YOU BECAUSE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRAINED TO BE ON THIS JOB OVER A YEAR AGO. WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS JOB TO BEGIN WE WENT TO THEM. IN NOVEMBER. AND BEFORE WE SAID WE WANT TO PUT YOU GUESS WORK NOW WE NEED WORKERS IN THE FIELD NOW. AND WE DESPITE. THE FIGHT WE GOT WE WHEN WE PULLED HIM IN AND THEY STARTED WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY. THEY STARTED SEEING WHAT THIS INDUSTRY REALLY IS LIKE. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS FOR US IS THAT. WE NEED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THESE TYPES OF CHEMICALS FOR THAT FOR AN ENTIRE BASICALLY CAREER. AND IT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY PROTECTED WE TRAIN THEM WE TRAIN THEM WELL. BUT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS IT'S AN IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT'S RAMPANT WITH UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS WHICH IS WHY WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE THESE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. AND SO WE ASK YOU. NOT ONLY TO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENCES FIND POCKETS OF FINDING CONTINUE. TO HELP THE CLEAN UP. CONTINUE THE CLEANUP GOING BUT ALSO FORGET THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE PROMISED THEM. JOBS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTRACTORS DON'T FORGET THAT. AND THE DETAILS HE DOESN'T FORGET THAT.

TO OUR NEXT UP WE HAVE -- MISTER BRUCE CAMPBELL. HI THERE ARE STATE LEGISLATORS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC I'M BRUCE CAMPBELL FIRST I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS I WISH. SOME EXPERTS WERE GOING TO ANSWER THEM. WHAT HEAVY METALS BESIDES LEAD AND ARSENIC WERE SPEWED BY THE EXCITED FACILITY? WHAT ABOUT CLEAN UP AT SCHOOL SITES? AND WHERE IS THE SOIL WITH THE ELEVATED HEAVY METALS TAKEN TOO AND DUMP THAT. I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE CLEANUP OF PCB CAULKING AT MALIBU HIGH SCHOOL AND SHE WOULD JOIN IN SCHOOLS. THE PCB IS UP TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES LEGAL LIMITS AND RELATED MATERIAL WERE HALTED THE CHIQUITA LANDFILL IN SANTA CLARITA CONVENTIONAL LANDFILL RATHER THAN A CLASS. RATHER THAN A CLASS ONE TOXIC DUMP. ALSO TOXIC HEAVY METALS ARE PURPOSELY ADDED 270% OVER 70% OF U. S. A PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY INCLUDING IN LA D. W. P. WATER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND AN M. W. D. WATER SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN RESEARCH YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS HI. LOUIS SILICIC ACID ON THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE INTERESTED MAKE US AND LEAD MERCURY DIESEL URANIUM AND OTHER TOXIC PURPOSELY ADDED EDGE OF DRAWINGS TO DRESS LIKE A BIG WATER SUPPLY. RICHARD BLUM VOTED TO POISON SANMON COM O'CONNOR ABOUT THEM IS FORTY THREE TO POISON SANTA MONICA. THANK YOU IT BECAUSE THIS IS.

EMMA HALL OF A GRANNY -- IN QUOTES AFTER HER NAME CINDY DORIS AND TERRY CANNOT. OKAY UGH GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP ALL MY NAME IS JOE AND ALL OF THEM A LONG TIME RESIDENT HERE WAS BORN RAISED LIVE AND WORK IN EAST LA. LONG TERM EXPOSURE IS INDEED A PROBLEM. I NOT ONLY OF LIVE HERE WORK HERE ON THE MAIL MAN I WORK OUTSIDE OF BREEDING JUST THESE CONTAMINANTS IN FOR SO LONG. IN DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT MY CANCER IS A SKIN CANCER OR MELANOMA I'M A DARKY AND I GOT A MELANOMA THAT'S A RARE ONE RIGHT OFF THE TOP IT'S INSIDE MY NOSE IT'S A MELANOMA. IT'S AN OUTSIDE CANCER BUT MINE IS INSIDE THERE IS A LONG TERM RISK CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS HERE THIS IS JUST. SOME OF THE STUFF FROM THIS HERE AND A LITTLE BIT FROM LAST YEAR EACH ONE OF THESE REPRESENTS A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS AT LEAST. AND THE CO PAY PLUS GAS PLUS A DAY'S WORK OF MIST PLUS YOU KNOW PARKING FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND STUFF LIKE THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE TO BE TOUCHED ON BECAUSE MY HOUSE IS NOT EVEN ON THE LIST OF THE HOMES ARE GOING TO BE CLEANED BUT YET I WAS CONTAMINATED IN MY OWN HOME. OKAY SO A LOT MORE CONTAMINATION IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING OUT THERE. THIS IS THE RISK OF LONG TERM COMING OUT OF TOWN A LOT MORE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP GETTING SIX US SICK I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COME UP WITH THIS STUFF BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. I HAVE NEVER STOP PAYING TAXES I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN HERE HAS EVER STOP PAYING TAXES. YOU KNOW I MEAN MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TAXES FOR BEING CONTAMINATED BY MY OWN STATE. MY OWN STATE GOVERNMENT. WHY ARE THEY IN CLEANING THIS STUFF UP AND FORGIVE ME IF I SOUND ANGRY IS NOT A GREAT FRUSTRATION AS FRUSTRATING AS I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE THEY WERE EVEN CLOSED? AND WE'RE HERE AND AND ALTHOUGH I'M GOING AND IT'S A PART OF IT'S BECAUSE I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU FOR FEAR THE OTHER PART IS BECAUSE I'VE. WITH INJECTED RADIATION TODAY BECAUSE I WENT TO ANOTHER PROCEDURE TODAY. OKAY UP WERE WAY WAY WORSE THE FLINT MICHIGAN FLINT MICHIGAN ON START OF BODY YEARS AGO COME ON WE'VE BEEN GOING ON FOR NINE DECADES OR MORE. OF THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST CONTENT DID THEY TALK ABOUT HOW MANY HOMES THEY CLAIM THEY HAVE NOT CLEANED A SINGLE HOME IF THEY DO NOT PLAN THE MOST CONTAMINATED AREAS OF THE HOME. THAT'S THE ATTIC AND THE PARKWAY THE ATTIC EVERYTIME YOU SLAM A DOOR THAT STUFF IS COMING DOWN OFF THE ROOF RIGHT ON YOUR DINNER. RIGHT ON YOUR DINNER TABLE RIGHT ON YOUR SOFA RIGHT ON YOUR CARPET. I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CLOCK AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT HIM EITHER UP. YOU CAN WE DO WANT TO HEAR BUT YOU BUT WE DO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE OKAY OKAY I WANT TO SAY TO THAT. YOU KNOW WE HEARD A THIS IS A LEARNING CURVE THERE'S NOT A LEARNING CURVE THEIR LIVES AT STAKE HERE -- LAST TIME THEY SAID WE'RE LEARNING AS WE GO ALONG THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT. WE DON'T NEED THE DTS IN CHARGE OF THIS THEY ARE SQUANDERING THE MONEY. HALL THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE OF THE MONEY WITHIN THE BATTERY TAX AND YOU'LL FIND THESE OTHER PLACES TO FIND OUT IN THE LAW IT SAYS THAT THE MONEY SHALL BE SPENT ON LEAD OF PLACES THAT ARE. KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN BECAUSE IT LED SO MANY OTHER QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS WHY DO WE HAVE ONLY. ONE YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS WHY IT'S TAKING SO LONG THERE'S SO MANY OTHER QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OUT THERE. THAT THE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MANY MANY MORE ON DUTY TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT THE X. I. CONSIDERS THIS AN EXPEDITIOUS CLEANUP. OF US FAR AS THE MOVING OUT STUFF LIKE THAT I HAD MY TEN YEAR OLD NEPHEW WHEN THE THEY WERE PUT IN THE DOGS IN DOGGY DAYCARE CENTER IN THE PORTER RANCH. HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID THAT'S NOT FAIR HOW COULD THEY PUT DOGS IN DOGGY DAYCARE BUT I HAVE TO LIVE IN THIS CONTAMINATION OUTLOOK MAY HEAR AN ANSWER FROM YOU ON THAT. ONE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE IT. THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE CHOICE WITH THE CLEAN THEIR GUARDS ARE NOT THEY DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPOSE ME TO CONTAMINATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT SOMEBODY ON THEIR SIDE. IN THE LAST LAST ONE AND I WANT TO GO BACK AND GET A GOOD LOOK AT THAT POINT IT IS THE LAST ONE AND I WILL COME BACK AND GIVE A LIST OF TWELVE QUESTIONS AFTER BUT DONE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WANNA GIVE MY FELLOW VICTIMS A CHANCE TO GET THEIR SPIEL OUT. TO EXCITE SUED THE CITY OF FRISCO TEXAS FOR TAKING TOO LONG THEY'RE CLEAN UP. I JUST WANTED YOUR TEAM TO KIND OF PUT THAT. IN THERE SOMEWHERE. I'LL GIVE THE OTHER QUESTION THE NEXT ROOM THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE A AND THE WHOLE PLACE. THEN KNOWN AS GRANNY THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK I CAME BEFORE YOU NOT ONLY TO THIS PANEL BUT FOR ALL THOSE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS. AFFECTED AREA. I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT. THE YOUTH. IMPRESSIONS WOMEN'S I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE BOOK TOUR AGE WHICH I AM. WE ARE AFFECTED WE HAVE OUR CHALLENGES AS BEING WE HAVE AN ENTRY. A CHALLENGE TO DEAL WITH. DON'T FORGET US. I HAVE. A SUMMER. OF GUYS SEE IT THANK YOU SWEET HOT. EVERYBODY'S BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT US. THAT'S THE REASON THE THE DEATH RATE THE RATE WENT UP SO HIGH IN SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. NEEDED SURGERY AT MY AGE AND OLDER AND THEY WERE ON OPTICIAN AND THEY COULDN'T GET IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ELECTRICITY PLEASE DON'T FORGET ABOUT US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHECKS IN THE DOORS FOLLOWED BY TERRY CANO AND YVONNE MARTINEZ ONCE. HI IT ASCENDED ON MEANS THAT THE CONNECTION I'M MULTIPLE TIMES. I'M A MEMBER AND ORGANIZER WITH EASE OUR COMMUNITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. I GREW UP IN. END OF MAY WOULD. IN MY PARENTS STILL LIVE IN THE APARTMENT WHERE I GREW UP AND I WANTED TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO TWO THINGS ONE BEING THE THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PARCELS THAT STILL HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED OR THEY'D THERE'S NO ACCESS TO THOSE -- WHERE MY PARENTS LIVE IT'S THAT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SO -- I ASSUME THE SITUATION MIGHT BE SIMILAR FOR THOSE OTHER PARCELS WHERE MY I REACHED OUT TO GET THE SOIL TESTED. THEY'VE TRIED TWICE BUT THERE'S A COMP IS ON THE PROPERTY. AND MY PARENTS ARE VERY FEARFUL AND TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO TALK TO THE LANDLORD BECAUSE OF HISTORIES OF EVICTIONS AND RENT INCREASES THAT MY PARENTS JUST KIND OF FORT. AND SO I HEAR IT. I HEARD THE THE CALL FROM THE PUBLIC WORKS AROUND NOT. TO THREATENING LANDLORDS AROUND CODE OF CONDUCT BUT I WOULD ALSO WANT TO HEAR AND SEE SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF PROTECTION FOR RENTERS -- AND ALSO IN DOCUMENT COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A IN A AREA WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE ALSO UNDOCUMENTED AND THAT'S AN ADDED FEAR. ALL WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE -- AND WE WISH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A BARRIER TO HAVING A CLEAN HOME. AND SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE IS AROUND CURRENT USE THAT WE HEARD AROUND FUNDING BEING TAKEN FROM THE BATTERY BILL. TO PAY BACK THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION AT WHEN THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION WERE ALLOCATED IT HAD BEEN PROMISED. THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE GOING TO BE RICH TAKEN FROM THE FOLKS THAT COMMITTED THIS ATROCIOUS CONTAMINATION. RIGHT BUT IT WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WOULD BE PAYING THAT BACK. AND SO WHEN THE MONEY IS BEING TAKEN FROM FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE BATTERY BUILT. IT'S PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE COMMUNITY THAT HAD BEEN IMPACTED. AND IT ALSO FEELS LIKE LIKE MY LOAN COLLECTOR OVER A BILL COLLECTOR WHEN THE FOR THE JOB ISN'T EVEN FINISHED HOW IS IT THAT FUNDS ARE ALREADY BEING COLLECTED. WHEN THAT WE STILL HAVE HOMES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED WE STILL HAVE HOMES THAT ARE CONTAMINATED? AND NOT ALL OF THESE HOMES HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP I HOPE THAT. AS AS REPRESENTATIVES YOU YOU WOULD JOIN A COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THIS FIGHT -- AND AND I I WAS LIKE WHY DID YOU ALLOWIT TO HAPPEN HOW YOU RECTIFY THAT. MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND GET THAT MONEY BACK -- BECAUSE I WAS MANY THAT THE COMMUNITY ONE AND JUST TO END HERE -- THOSE FUNDS THAT WERE TAKEN FROM THAT I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY DISCUSSING THAT THEY'RE BEING USED. BY AN ADDED INTO JERRY BROWN'S A SURPLUS. WHAT HE CALLS A SURPLUS FOR A RAINY DAY? WHEN IT'S BEEN RAINING IT'S BEEN POURING LEAD? ON US FOR DECADES AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE SUNSHINE. SO I WOULD REALLY HOPE THAT YOU JOIN COMMUNITY IN THIS FIGHT. AND GET THOSE FUNDS BACK AND GET MORE FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS TERRY KENNAN. OKAY HIGH -- TERRY KANO. OF FIRST I WANT. TO FORGIVE ME IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE BECAUSE I AM A SEVERE ASTHMATIC. TAKE YOUR TIME THINKING WHEN? AFTER FIGHTING THIS FOR TEN YEARS. THERE ARE SO MANY POINTS. THAT. WE WANT TO TOUCH ON SO I'LL GO WITH SHE'S A COUPLE [inaudible] TO ONE IS. FOR YEARS I ASKED DTS SEE. WHAT? ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR THE HEALTH AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THIS DOCUMENTATION ALL THIS THIS LITERATURE GOING OUT OF HOW LATE CAN CAUSE THIS THIS AND THIS. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU I'VE LIVED IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR FORTY SEVEN YEARS. I AM THE EFFECTS OF LONG TERM. EXPOSURE TO LEAD AND NOT JUST LEAD BUT ARSENIC BENZENE EXCELLENT CHROMIUM ALL THE OTHER CHEMICALS THAT DTS SEE IT DOES NOT WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT HAS CAUSED MY WHOLE FAMILY TO BE SICK. I HAVE BEEN THAT CHILD BECAUSE I WAS BORN INTO THIS. IN THIS COMMUNITY. WHO THAT PREMATURE CHILD AND I WAS BORN PREMATURELY I WAS THAT FIVE YEAR OLD? DIGGING IN THE DIRT. I WAS THAT PREGNANT WOMAN WHO HAD TO PREMATURE BIRTHS BOTH AT SEVEN MONTHS. BOTH OF MY CHILDREN HAD TO BE IN AND I SEE YOU [inaudible] AND I WAS THAT SENSITIVE. RECEPTOR THIS SENSITIVE PERSON IN HERE. MY BODY IS BROKEN AND DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR. MY BROTHER WHO SPOKE EARLIER HIS HAD HAS CANCER HE IS BEYOND REPAIR. MY PARENTS WHO PASSED AWAY BECAUSE OF THE CONTAMINATION ARE BEYOND REPAIR. I DON'T SEE HOW DTS THESE ALLOWED. TO CONTINUE TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY. ON ON THIS CLEAN UP WHEN YEARS AGO I HAVE ASKED AND I AND I DID SOME RESEARCH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER. FOR US TO GET CLEANED UP ON A LARGE SCALE THE CORRECT WAY IF WE WOULD HAVE DECLARED THIS A FEDERAL EMERGENCY. SO THEY DDS HE DOESN'T HAVE THE EXCUSE OF HIDING BEHIND RED TAPE AND AND AND LAWS AND WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO. AND THE NEXT THING IS. DTS THREE AFTER ASKING THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR THE HEALTH AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS. AND GETTING NO RESPONSE WHEN I FINALLY GOT ONE THEY SAID ALL THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS PROBLEM. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DID NOT CAUSE THIS. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. DOES NOT HAVE THE FUNDS. TO HELP THE HEALTH AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS WITH MEDICATIONS COPAYMENTS PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. INHALERS I SPEND OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. ON MEDICATIONS. AND I HAVE INSURANCE. CHILDREN NEED SERVICES AND AND I HAVE TO SAY I REALLY WANT. TO THANK DEPARTMENT HEALTH BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE JUST COME IN AND GIVEN ME HOPE. AND TAKE IN WHAT I AND MY CONCERNS AND ARE YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THAT YOU CAN. WITH WHAT YOU HAVE. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH THE THEY'RE REFERRING TO PROGRAMS AND AGECIES THAT WERE ALREADY OVERWHELMED AT BEFORE THE REFERRALS. AND WHEN I HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT. PART OF THAT HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION FOR THE GAS COMPANY. MESSED UP. WAS GONNA GO TO HEALTH STUDIES AND TO HELP. IN SERVICES FOR THEM. I CRIED OUT HER FRUSTRATION. BECAUSE THEY WON'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE AND PEOPLE GOT NOSE BLEED AND I'M SORRY NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER FOR ANY. ANY CORPORATE MISS DOINGS. BUT WE'VE WE'RE DYING HERE AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN ANY MONEY. FOR HEALTH STUDIES. I AM BEGGING FOR HEALTH STUDIES TO BE DONE BEFORE THE LAST OF US LONG TERM EXPOSURE RESIDENTS. ARE GONE WE ARE THE PERFECT PEOPLE TO DO THESE HEALTH STUDIES ON THE COUNTY NEEDS MORE MONEY FOR ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE REFERRING. TO AND THAT MONEY SHOULD COME FROM THE BATTERY TAX. MONEY IT SHOULD GO THERE NOT TO DO TST WHO TOLD US JUST LAST MONTH [inaudible] THAT. THE WAY THEY INTERPRET THAT BILL IS THAT THEY CAN USE IT HOWEVER THEY WANT TO AS LONG AS IT'S GOING TO LEAD. SO TO TELL US THAT YOU WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO CLEAN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT THE MONEY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME TO CLEAN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY'RE DECIDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT ELSEWHERE TO INVESTIGATE OTHER PLACES. ALL OVER THE STATE AND LEAVE US IN THIS CONTAMINATION I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT IN MY LIFETIME. I WILL SEE THE COMPLETION OF THIS. YOU COULD WRAP UP BUT DON'T MAKE IT. I WOULD DO SOMETHING. ENACTED LAWS. GET THEM TAKEN OUT OF LEAD AGENCIES DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY HAVE IMMUNITY. THERE IS NO THEY THE PEOPLE FROM FROM FLINT MICHIGAN THOSE PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL. DTS THE WHO ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN HAS IMMUNITY AND THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS. IN OUR BEST INTEREST PORTER HURRY REMOVE THAT IMMUNITY. AND LET'S SEE HOW FAST THE MOVEMENT. THANK YOU VERY COMMENTS -- VON WATTS. FOLLOWED BY MARY ANGELA RINCON. SERAPHINA AND MONEY BELLEFONTE. HI MY NAME IS YVONNE MARTINEZ WATSON -- MY FAMILY HAS VERY DEEP ROOTS HERE IN EAST LA. MY PARENTS WERE MET AND MARRIED IN EAST LA -- I'M HAVING TROUBLE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE. VERY BAD AS MOST. I WAS ACTUALLY BORN WITH. OF MR DURING THE MILLENNIUM UP. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE FOR THE SIERRA CLUB ANGELES CHAPTER. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE MEETINGS FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF NOW. AND ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND ME. THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE THE ONE YOU JUST LISTEN TO THOSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE MY HEROES. BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING TO LIVE WITH THIS. AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT EVERY DAY. AT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY. I APPRECIATE THE LADY THAT CAME UP AND SAID DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE ELDERLY. PLEASE DON'T FORGET ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH A SMIRK. PEOPLE WITH COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS. OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS. BECAUSE THIS SORT OF LEAD CONTAMINATION WILL AFFECT EVERYBODY THAT HAS THOSE KIND OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS OR PROBLEMS. SO IT IS A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE PROBLEM THAN JUST. CHILDREN. AND AND A PREGNANT WOMEN -- I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT UP WHEN YOU DO. WHEN THEY OFFER THE INDOOR CLEAN -- I WAS THERE IN PORTER RANCH. TO TESTIFY. AFTER THE RELEASE OF CANNIBAL OUT. AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE PEOPLE IN PORTER RANCH WHEN THEY WERE OFFERED CLEANING INSIDE THEIR HOMES. THEY WERE SUSPICIOUS. AND THE REASON WHY THEY WERE SUSPICIOUS IS BECAUSE WHEN YOU COME IN AND YOU CLEAN THE INTERIOR OF A WHOLE. WITHOUT FIRST TAKING SAMPLINGS. IN THAT HOME. YOU'VE JUST DESTROYED EVIDENCE. SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT BEFORE. PEOPLE GO IN TO DO PLANNING ON THESE PHONES WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT SHOULD BE DONE. BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HOLD EXACT ACCOUNTABLE. DON'T DESTROY THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO DO THAT. SOMEBODY HAS TO GO IN THERE AND DO SAMPLING. THAT WILL HOLD UP IN COURT. BECAUSE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO WEASEL OUT OF THIS. THEY'RE ALREADY TRYING TO DO THAT I JUST KNOW IT. I ALSO WANT TO SEE THAT. YOU NEED TO HOLD THE TSC RESPONSIBLE [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. THEY WERE THE AGENCY THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS COMPANY WAS DOING THINGS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. AND THEY FAILED THE FAILED MISERABLY. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. THEY WERE STILL RESPONSIBLE. SO I AM JUST APPALLED. BUT THEY ARE EVEN INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL. I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU PUT IN THE THE THE FOX IN CHARGE OF THE HEN HOUSE. AND THEY GIVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. I'M ASKING YOU PLEASE WE NEED THE MONEY TO DO THE CLEANUP TO GET ALL THE PLACES CLEANED UP NOT JUST SOMEONE. BUT ALL OF THEM. BECAUSE YOU GET THIS WORK IF THIS WAS A NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION ISSUE. WOULD YOU BE SATISFIED IF WE ARE THE PROPERTY WAS CLEANED. OKAY YOU GO NEXT DOOR TO A NUCLEAR WASTE SITE. THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE AND I GUARANTEE YOU IF THIS WERE HAPPENING IN PORTER RANCH. YOU WOULD HAVE DOZENS OF LAWSUITS FILED AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. SO PLEASE FIND THE MONEY. GET THIS CEANED UP. DO RESPONSIBLY. AND PLEASE THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE JUST AS VALUABLE. AS ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY OF RALEIGH THANK YOU THANK YOU. AREAS OF A WRINKLE. GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS MY DEBATE BECAUSE THE YOUNG I AM A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'M ALSO A CO CHAIR FOR THE ACLU SEVEN TO ONE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ACTION TEAM. NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WHY IS LABOR INVOLVED WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. YOU KNOW. WE ARE AWARE AND SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THOUSANDS OF OUR S. YEAH YOU MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVE AND WORK IN NEIGHBORHOODS CONTAMINATED BY THE EXCITED. AND HERE'S A MAP AND FIGURED MAYBE SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE OVER THERE. TOO SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MANY MEMBERS WITHIN THE EXCITING AREA LIVE. LIVE THERE SO THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US. MANY OF OUR OUR MEMBERS WORK IN SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND CLINICS THAT TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE POISONED BY EXIDE ONE IN PARTICULAR IS A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AND ARE AND WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT AND SHE GREW UP IN THIS AREA. SHE WAS UNABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN AT THE BEGINNING AND WAS GRATEFULLY. PREGNANT TWICE SO SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW IN A YOUNG ADULTS HOWEVER BOTH OF HER CHILDREN SUFFER FROM MEDICAL CONDITIONS. SHE WILL NEVER BE A GRANDMOTHER AND ONE OF HER WORRIES IS WHO IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF HER CHILDREN WHEN SHE'S GONE. SCO YOU SUPPORTED THE BILL FOR THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE ALSO PARTICIPATED HUNDREDS OF OUR MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE HISTORIC JUNE TENTH NEIGHBORHOOD OUTREACH. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PACE AND SCALE OF CLEANUP IS INADEQUATE. THE AREA TO BE CLEANED UP MUST BE EXPANDED AND THE FUNDS COLLECTED MUST BE USED RESPONSIBLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SERVER RIDIN. HIGH MY NAME IS FANNIE -- I'M A FIRST WOMAN OF COLOR AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I'M A LITTLE HEIGHTS RESIDENT. AND I'M. ALSO A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER AND A COMMUNITY FARMER BUT TODAY I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING OVER TWO THOUSAND SEIU MEMBERS. AND THAT'S NOT THE MARKERS THE CAPTAIN -- I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT. WE BELIEVE EXCESS SHOULD BE A BATTERY TAX IN ADDITION TO CLEANING UP GOES FACTORIES. SPECIALLY DOLLS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND MONEY FROM THE TAX SHOULD NOT BE DIVERTED TO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSING THAT ACID BATTERY MEDICATION. DTS HE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ADHERING TO A STRINGENT SCHEDULE FOR CLEANUP. RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY NEED TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE CLEANUP IS PROCEEDING. ADEQUATELY. THE REMOVAL OF CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE PARKWAYS BETWEEN THE STREET AND THE FRONT YARDS THE REMOVAL OF LEAD DUST FROM THE HOME INTERIORS. VERIFICATION TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERIOR OF THE HOME IS SAFE FOR OCCUPANCY. A BLOCK BY BLOCK STRATEGY FOR CLEANUP TO MINIMIZE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH STATES CURRENT PARCEL BY PARCEL. APPROACH AND LASTLY LIKE MISTER YOU GOT SOMETHING TO STATE IT HOW CAN SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN I HSS PROVIDERS CAN STEP IN AND MAKING A LASTING IMPACT IN ASSISTING IN THAT EXCITE CLEAN UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH RIVERA. I'M HERE TO REPRESENT MY NAME IS AKBAR GUY AND I'M HERE TO REPRESENT -- SEIU LOCAL NINETY NINE WE ARE EDUCATIONAL WORKERS WORKING FOR ELLIOTT LAUSD WERE CLASSIFIED WORKERS. AND WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT. I WORK WITH KIDS WHO ARE DEAF ANDHARD OF HEARING WHO ALSO HAVE. PHYSICAL AND SOME MENTAL DISABILITIES [inaudible] AND THEY LIVE IN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AFFECTED AND I WORK WITH. FLOOD ASSISTANCE WHO ACTUALLY GO TO THIS CHURCH. SO I AM GIVING THEM THE VOICE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE HERE. AND WE ARE THE SECOND -- LARGEST MEMBERSHIP OF THE LOCAL THAT IS AFFECTED. BY THIS SO I NEED YOU GUYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T DOESN'T AFFECT ANY MORE PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH AND I CARE ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. JOHN THEIR MENU. ROGER NEWER AND MARTHA JIMENEZ. MY NAME IS JOHN SIR MANUAL. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN BOYLE HEIGHTS. I NOW LIVE IN THE CITY OF COMMERCE. I'M A MEMBER. OF THE EXITE WORKERS AND COMMUNITY COMMITTEE [inaudible] THE DEVELOPED. ALTHOUGH THE RACISM BY A CONTRACTOR IN PHASE ONE OF THE TESTING PROCESS OF EXCITE. THE COMPANY THE DGSE. CHOSE WAS RACES. ALL THE ADMINISTRATORS HAD NEVER BEEN IN CALIFORNIA. HAD NEVER SEEN A MEXICAN INNER LIFE. HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN? SO DO TSC IS NOT A GOOD. AGENCY TO TO RUN THIS PROJECT IN ADDITION. THE CLEAN UP HAS TO BE. INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY INSIDE THE HOME. IN OUTSIDE THE HOME HAS TO BE COMPLETE. IT HAS TO BE QUALITY WORK OUR COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES THAT. WE WANT THAT AND WE DEMAND THAT. WE NEED TO BE TREATED AS EQUAL AS ANYONE ELSE. ON THE WORK WITH OF THE TESTING I WAS IN PHASE ONE I'M I'M IN ONE OF THE WORKERS. WHEN WE FINISHED IN APRIL OF? TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT TOOK DTS. OVER A YEAR TO GET US BACK IN THE FACE TO DO THE CLEANUP. THEY DELAYED AND DELAYED. WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT PROCESS? THE WORKERS SPACE. FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS AN ALARM HAD TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. A LOT OF THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES. FELL IN LOVE WITH A NEW ISSUE. A LOT OF THEM HAD NEVER WORKED ON A PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS. BUT ONCE THEY GOT INVOLVED ONCE THEY INTEGRATED WITH THE COMMUNITY. THEY SAW ALL PURPOSE IN THEIR LIFE. AND THEY WANTED TO GO BACK TO WORK. AND DID YOU EVER SEE DISMANTLED KILLED IT. SO WE CAN HAVE AN AGENCY THAT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT USER APPARATUS. BUILDING THEIR POWER BASE AS YOU CAN SEE THE DATE. AND I TOLD HIM DIRECTLY. BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IS GENERAL BUT I THINK IT'S TRUE I I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE. POLITICAL FIGURES YOUR POLITICAL OFFICIALS. WE'RE PART OF A MOVEMENT THAT'S DEVELOPING IN SOUTHEAST LA. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF IMMIGRATION. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF CIVIC. ENGAGEMENT. AND WE'RE ALSO OUR BIGGEST COMMITTEE IS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE. SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING. AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE LABOR UNIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT. TO GIVE IT POWER INTEGRATE THE CHANGES UNDER BACK OUR PEOPLE. AND THE STRUGGLES WERE EXCITE IS PRIMARY. HEALTH ISSUE. IT HAS TWO APPROACHES WORK FROM THAT ANGLE IT HAS TO START FROM THERE. BUT THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE MONEY THEY LOOK AT THE POWER. WE CANNOT STAND FOR THAT SO THIS [inaudible] THIS. THE BENTONVILLE JUST I'M ALMOST AT THE ENDING THANK YOU WILL BE AUGUST.

DECEMBER MENTAL JUSTICE WORK AND ACTUALLY WENT TO GO VISIT YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER [inaudible] BLOOM. I'M SO HE ACTUALLY WAS WORKING ON THE ORCA BILL VERY PASSIONATE JUST LIKE YOU UP OR BECAUSE HE LOVES WORK AS AS FOR THREE YEARS LATER. HE HAS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE HE WAS RAISED IN THE CITY OF MY WHAT. I'M STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW GOING TO SCHOOL -- HE HAS EVERYTHING FROM A BLEEDING NOSE TO VOMITING HEADACHES NOT ABLE TO GET UP OFF THE BED BECAUSE HE'S SUFFERING FROM ALL THESE ILLNESSES RIGHT. IN ADDITION TO THAT ASTHMA SO PERSPECTIVE I WOULD LOVE FOR LAUSD TO SIT DOWN THIS TABLE AND DISCUSS HOW THEY'RE GOING TO HANDLE TH SITUATION OF THE INFLUX OF CHILDREN THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW IN SCHOOL. TO DO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE OTHER MOMS ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO -- EITHER A SPEAKING TO THEIR DOCTORS BECAUSE ONE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE MEDICINES AND TO FINDING OTHER ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS HOMEOPATHIC -- OPTIONS BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IS GETTING PRICEY FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITY SO I'M I WOULD LOVE FOR LAUSD MORE SPECIFICALLY. TO COME AND SIT IN THE TABLE SO -- LIKE MY NEPHEW WAS HARASSED FOR A FEW YEARS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THAT BECAUSE HE WAS STUCK. IN BED AT HOME SO DOES BEING REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT A AT A HOUSE THAT WITH A CHILD IS STRUGGLING. THROUGH ALL OF THIS I'M JUST PUTTING A PERSPECTIVE THAT HE HE'S A GIFTED CHILD STRUCK. HARD CORE WORKER WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO ON HIS HOMEWORK NOT LAZY IF AT ALL AND BUT I'LL JUST TELL YOU THIS MUCH PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE CHILDREN ARE STRUGGLING AND THEY'RE TRYING -- TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN BUT THEY NEED OUR HELP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADD COMMENTS. I WOULD LIKE TO PLEASE STEP UP TO THE MICROPHONE [inaudible] SO. I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THEY ARE AFFECTED COMMUNITY THE PRESENCE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [inaudible] FOR I NEXT MEETING. BECAUSE HE'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE US FEEDBACK ON WHAT IS GOING ON HOW HE'S WORKING WITH THE TWO SEE. I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR THE LONG* BUT I AM REQUESTING CONSTITUTIONALLY TO HAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HOW IT WAS SET UP. THANK YOU VERY EASILY THE ICE HARD IN YEARS TO OUR REQUESTS. THANKS THANK YOU. I'M. NOT REALLY. SURE YOU'RE GONNA BUT FROM WHAT I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS AND YOU CAN THINK OF THE ANSWERS AND PERHAPS PROVIDING INTERNET ARE YOU HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT NO NO BUT ALREADY. WHAT'S THAT NO ONE ELSE IS WILLING TO SPEAK RIGHT NOW NEEDS. WHICH WHICH MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE THE PUBLIC HEARING PART OF THAT A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO SQUEEZE ONE ADDING ONE YEAR'S WORK LIKE COMMENT THAT I WANT I WANT TO CUT YOU OFF BUT BUT ONE MORE QUICK COMMENT. OKAY AMENDED WITH THIS AND THEN IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO SQUEEZE EIGHT YEARS OF FRUSTRATION OF BITE. INTO THE TIME RESTRAINTS ARE GIVEN US AND I THINK THAT'S VERY VERY UNFAIR AND TALK ABOUT RACIAL THAT'S JUST SO UNFAIR. ANY OTHER COMMENTS THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE THAT. MS GARCIA. ONE THAT I THINK EVERYONE. BEING DEBATED COMMUNITY AND ALL OF THAT THAT WE DON'T CARE. WHAT YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SORT OF THING? THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. THE MILLION BETWEEN ONE FIFTY THREE AND THE OTHER THE ABILITY TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE INTENTION OF THAT BUILDING UP BUILDING OUT HALF. HE PAID BACK OF THE BUILDING AFFIRMATION THAT. WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE AFFECTED HOMES OUT THERE [inaudible] OKAY. AND JANE WILLIAMS TALK ABOUT THE ATROCITIES OF MATCHES HAVING THAT WHEN THE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED WE WERE NEGOTIATING THAT. ATROCITY ALSO WHEN OUR MONEY IS BEING TAKEN AWAY -- INSTEAD OF TO THE LEFT THERE SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN USE IT FOR ALL OF OUR HOMES IF WE HAVE A RAINY FUN FOR THE STATE WE COULD HAVE A RAINY FUN FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT THAT BILL IS ABOUT. ON AND SO I HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE GUARANTEED THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT THAT MONEY CANNOT BE USED TO PAY BACK THE LOAN UNTIL EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CLEANED UP. THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED AND NOT JUST THE DOLLARS WE HAVE NOW. WORSE OFF IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT BILL IS GOING TO BE CUT EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE IT'S PART OF IT SUNSETS. AND I HOPE THAT WE ALSO DO THE OPPOSITE COMMUNITY TO LEGISLATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOES NOT SUNSET. ON AND IT'S USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSES WHICH WAS TO CLEAN UP EXCITED THE OTHERS MONITORING SITES ARE ALSO FROM BATTERY -- CONTAMINATION IN THE AREA BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST EXCITED. AND SO I THINK IT'S FRUSTRATING TO COME HERE AGAIN. IT'S FRUSTRATING AS AN AUTHOR OF A BILL THAT PROMISES COMMUNITY THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. TO THEN HAVE IT BE USED OTHERWISE AND SETTLED MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE THE FOCUS TO FIGHT TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE NO ONE SAT BEHIND THE DEFINED TOGETHER TO FINE TUNE THAT BUILD. ON AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND AGAIN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE CAN JUST FOCUS ON THE MOST CONTAMINATED HOMES WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON THE MOTHERS. AND BABIES WE CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON BOYLE HEIGHTS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT BULL HEADEDNESS DONE. BUT IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST THE SALLY AMPLE HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDES MADE WOULD HIDING THEM PART. BELL CLIMBERS WHO KNOWS WHAT'S OUT THERE I THINK WE NEED TO REPEAT ALL THEIR NEEDS HAVE NOT WE'RE GONNA FORGET THEM AND WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND. ON SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATIVE AND I THINK FINALLY WHATEVER. LAST WEEK OR SAID ABOUT. WE NEED TO ALLOW THE COMMUNITY TO BE PART OF MAKING THE DECISION. IS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW BETTER BUT THIS IS OUR HOME IN OUR BACKYARD WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING IN THIS CITY NEEDS TO BE A COMPROMISE. YES COMPROMISE BOTH WAYS AND MAYBE WILL TAKE SOME OF WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS SAYING BUT A HASSLE. IT'S BEEN MOSTLY WENT AWAY ON AND SO I HOPE THAT FOR THOSE OF THE TERM POWER WE START TO LET THEM SET THE AGENDA A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE MAYBE WILL HAVE. LESS ANGRY PEOPLE AND MAYBE WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY THE PLUSES AND TINGS GET A LITTLE DELAYED. IF IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THEIR TERMS I THINK YOU ALL FOR STICKING AROUND. THIS LONG IT'S IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND AND I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN THIS FIGHT FOR MUCH LONGER. MS GARCIA -- WHICH YOU MIGHT -- JUST LETTING EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE BILL SUNSETS BECAUSE THERE THAT I DON'T. MEAN THAT IN A COUPLE YEARS PART OF THAT HE WILL NO LONGER BE COLLECTED -- AND SO WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO COLLECT THAT UNLESS IT'S EXTENDED BY. AND THEN I WILL BE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO EXPEND THE FUNDS THAT I WILL BE IT'LL INCLUDE TO EXPAND HOW MUCH WE COLLECT. AND ALSO TO GUARANTEE THAT IT STAYS IN THE MY PEERS IN THE NEXT GOVERNOR I WILL BE ON BOARD FOR THAT BUT WE'LL NEED ALL YOUR HELP WITH THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT STAYED FOR THE DURATION OF THIS HEARING -- AGAIN MY NAME IS WHEN YOU GOT A DEAL I AM RECENTLY ELECTED -- THINK ANOTHER JOB NOW FOR SEVEN MONTHS. AND INHERITED THIS IS HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AS A A SOME OF THAT GREW UP IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT LIVES IN THIS COMMUNITY WHO HAS FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER REMARKS IN THIS COMMUNITY. THIS IS PERSONAL. AND PART OF HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE IS ENSURING THAT WE ARE FIGHTING. FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT COMMUNITY SO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE -- I DO WANT TO PUT SOMEBODY A SOMETHING THAT THAT SOMEONE SAID EARLIER THAT REALLY STUCK STUCK WITH ME. SOMEONE SAID HOPE HAS TWO PARENTS COURAGE AND ACTION. AND I REALLY DO WISH AND MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE FORMAT AND HOW THIS WAS ALL DONE BUT AS DIRECTOR BARBARA LEVY AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR MOST IN THE SUNNY ARE STILL HERE. AND THEY ARE LISTENING I REALLY WISH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS SIDE SO YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ACTUALLY ARE GIVING THEIR TESTIMONY BUT I DO HOPE. THAT. WELL THERE'S THEY'RE SITTING DOWN AND THEY'RE LISTENING WHICH MEANS SOMETHING. I HOPE THAT YOU LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY AND I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO COME BACK. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF US THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE TSC ACCOUNTABLE. I IN ENSURING THAT THE CLEAN U IS DONE IN A MORE SPEEDY FASHION. THAT THE WORKERS ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT THE COMMUNITY IS TAKING CARE OF AND THEN WE START LOOKING AT THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS. THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS FACED FOR DAY AND PART OF THAT IS A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY TO THAT DEPARTMENT. AND SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR EVERYONE THAT. STATE THAT WILL CONTINUE IN THIS FIGHT AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE THAT. UNDERSTAND AND WANT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND AGAIN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR THE HEARING BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THAT OF THE PEAKER WHO IS HERE WITH US EARLIER IN THE LEADERSHIP OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIGHT MUCH LONGER. THAN I HAVE THANK YOU MISTER SANTIAGO. WILL ALTHOUGH YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS FIGHT FOR VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY FIERCE AT IT SO I WILL. I WILL SAY THAT -- SINCE SHE GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE BEGAN TO TALK THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES. BUT BUT YOU KNOW. I THINK -- I THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR HERE -- FOR THIS COMMUNITY WITH THIS COMMUNITY'S BEEN FIGHTING FOR HERE -- DOESN'T STOP TODAY. AND WE'VE. WE'VE GONE AFTER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. SOME FOLKS SAID THAT WE WANTED MORE DOLLARS ABSOLUTELY WHEN WE STARTED THIS AND AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE CONTEST WE ASK FOR TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THE FOR THE HONOR FOR THE PARK WAITS. YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL BUT WE GOT SIX POINT. FIVE YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR WE COME BACK AND WE SHOOT FOR MORE. AND DO WE WILL CONTINUE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. A WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES UNTIL WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO CLEAN UP THIS NEIGHBORHOOD NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS SAID OF WHAT WE ALWAYS WORK TOWARDS. BUT I'M CALM PRETTY CONFIDENT. ABOUT WHAT THE TYPE LEADERSHIP THAT THAT WE HAVE HERE THAT WILL CONTINUE THAT FIGHT. AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THIS COMMUNITY WHAT WILL FIGHT WITH US AND CONTINUED UNTIL EVERY HOUSE IS CLEAN. AND UNTIL WE DO JUSTICE AND UNTIL FOLKS WHO RAN EXCITE. HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED FOR THE CRIMES THAT THEY'RE DONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND IN MOST HEARD SOMEBODY SAY DETAILS OF COURSE WERE. ABSOLUTELY PART OF HAVING THESE MEETINGS HERE. IS TO HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR CLEANING UP THE REASON WE STARTED THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND IT WAS A VERY CLEAR LOUD MESSAGE. FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE ALL REPRESENT HERE THAT THERE WASN'T ANY COMMUNICATION. AND SO WE FIGHT EXTREMELY HARD TO GET COMMUNICATION GOING. PART OF THE BUDGET HEARING WE'RE HAVING HERE US SO THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM FOR HAVING THIS HERE. IS IS THE IS THE HOLD IS TO INCREASE ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TO HEAR IT ON RECORD THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN UP THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. LOOK THERE'S BEEN SOME STUMBLES ALONG THE WAY NODE. BUT HERE'S THE CATCH THE COMMITMENT THAT I HEAR VERY LOUD AND STRONG IS IT ISN'T A MOMENTARY ISSUE. IT'S NOT A SOUND BITE. WASN'T JUST A PRESS RELEASE OR PRESS CONFERENCE. THE LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO GET THIS PLACE CLEANED UP AND I AND I IN AND AND AND AND I KNOW THAT I CAN. I CAN SPEAK FOR MY CALL BUT I KNOW THAT I CAN SPEAK FOR THE SENTIMENT.
