EIGHT FIVE. WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM MIKE TILL THEN DEPUTY STATE AUDITOR ON THE ISSUES BEFORE US TODAY WELCOME MR UNTIL THE. GOOD MORNING BERMAN. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MIGHT TELL THEM I'M A DEPUTY STATE AUDITOR AND I'M HERE TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF TWO WATER EXCEPT INDUCTED ON BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND RELATED INVESTIGATION- SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRST SITE THAT WE DID ON THE BOARDS AND FORSMAN FUNCTIONS IN A ROW. AND THE NUMBERS MORE TIME TO ABOUT. MORE REESE. BURKE AT ACTUALLY. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS- SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. FOR THE FIRST AUDIT THAT WE RELEASED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOCUS ON THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING SEND FORSMAN FUNCTIONS AND THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING THE NURSING PRACTICES ACT AND REGULATING OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT INCLUDES INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS. AND THESE COMPLAINTS AGAINST LICENSED NURSES THEY RANGE FROM COMPLAINTS RELATED TO INCOMPETENCE OR NEGLIGENCE ALL THE WAY TO CASES INVOLVING GREAT BODILY INJURY- DEATH OR ANY CRIME AGAINST A- CHILDREN OR THE ELDERLY. SO IN THAT REPORT THE KEY FINDINGS WERE NUMBER ONE. YEAR AND REALLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN PROCESSING THESE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEIR LICENSE NURSES FOR EXAMPLE WE FOUND THAT THE BOARD CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO MEET THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS GOAL OF COMPLETING THESE INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. I TO GIVE YOU A FLAVOR FOR THAT WE REVIEWED FORTY COMPLAINTS AND WE FOUND THAT FOR THIRTY ONE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS IT TOOK THE BOARD LONGER THAN A HUNDRED OR EIGHT I'M SORRY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO RESOLVE THE COMPLAINTS. IN FACT FIFTEEN OF THOSE COMPLAINTS ACTUALLY TOOK LONGER THAN THREE YEARS FOR THE BOARD TO RESOLVE SO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. AND THOSE DELAYS PRIMARILY OCCURRED WE FOUND BECAUSE OF B. R. AND INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OVER ITS OWN COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCESS AND ITS FAILURE TO MOVE THESE COMPLAINTS THROUGH THE VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROCESS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER. AND ULTIMATELY THESE DAYS THESE DELAYS CONTRIBUTED TO A BACKLOG OF CASES AWAITING ASSIGNMENT TO THE INVESTIGATORS- BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE AT THE TIME OF THE AUDIT IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY WE IDENTIFIED A BACKLOG OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY CASES. THEY HAD NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED TO AN INVESTIGATOR AND SEVENTY OF THOSE CASES. REALLY INVOLVED COMPLAINTS THAT WERE DEEMED TO BE URGENT ARE HIGH PRIORITY AND THEY WERE OUTSTANDING AND HADN'T BEEN ASSIGNED TO AN INVESTIGATOR FOR AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN EIGHTY DAYS. WE MADE NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING TO ADDRESS THOSE KEY FINDINGS AND IMPROVE ITS COMPLAINT RESOLUTION PROCESS. AND YOU KNOW NEARLY FOUR YEARS LATER AT THE BOARD HAS IMPLEMENTED ALMOST ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO ITS BACKLOG AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NEXT. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT BEER AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR RESOLVING THIS BACKLOG OF CASES AND ASSIGNING IT TO APPLICABLE INVESTIGATORS AND IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO YEARS AFTER WE COMPLETE THE REPORT. B. R. AND ASSERTED TO US THAT THEY HAD RESOLVED THIS PROBLEM THEY HAD RESOLVED THIS BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS AND THEY ACTUALLY SENT US A REPORTED OUR REQUEST IN SUPPORT OF THAT. LAST FOUR TWO YEARS LATER IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE RECEIVED A WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT. THAT ALLEGES THAT BEER AND THEY HAD SUBMITTED THIS REPORT BUT IT WAS FALSIFIED. IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE ALLEGATION WAS THE BEER AND HAD FALSIFIED THIS REPORT WITH THE INTENT OF CONVINCING US. THAT HAD REDUCED ITS BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS WHEN IN FACT IT HAD NOT. SO WE ARE CONDUCTING A FORMAL INVESTIGATION AND WE ACTUALLY CONFIRM THAT BE ARE INDEED FALSIFY THIS REPORT. AND SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT TWO EXECUTIVES HAD DEVISED THE PLAN. COULD MANIPULATE B. R. ENDS DATA SAID TO BASICALLY CONVINCE US THAT IT HAD CLEARED THE BACKLOG IN THE WAY THAT THE BOARD DID THIS. IS THEY WENT INTO THEIR- CASELOAD SYSTEM AND THEY REASSIGNED CASES TWO DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS SO THAT NO ONE INVESTIGATOR HOW TO CASELOAD OF MORE THAN TWENTY CASES. AND THEY DID THAT IN PART BY SIGNING INVESTIGATIONS TO INVESTIGATORS THAT WERE ON LEAVE FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING CASES. AND TO A MANAGER THAT TYPICALLY DIDN'T REALLY WORK ON CASES AT ALL. SO IN RELIANCE ON THAT REPORTS WE CONCLUDED THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION OR THIS RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED AND WE INDICATE GOVERNOR PUBLICLY FACING WEBSITES. AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF DOING THAT THESE BEER AND MANAGERS WENT BACK INTO THEIR SYSTEM AND REVERSE MANY OF THESE REASSIGNMENTS. AND WITHIN TEN DAYS THEY HAD REASSIGNED ALL THE CASES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATORS. SO WE COMPLETE OUR REPORT PUBLISHED IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE HAD SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ONE WE RECOMMENDED THAT B. R. AND TAKE APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THESE EXECUTIVES THAT ALSO BY THIS REPORT. TO WE RECOMMENDED THAT B. R. AND REASSESS THE- APPROPRIATE CASELOAD THRESHOLDS FOR ITS INVESTIGATORS AND WHEN BEYOND REPORTED TO US LATER IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. THEY SAID THAT THEY DISMISSED TWO OF THE EXECUTIVES THAT WERE INVOLVED IN FALSIFYING THE REPORT AND A THIRD AND A THIRD. OF THESE EXECUTIVES ACTUALLY LEFT TO BE IRAN BUT THEY SAID THEY PUT A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATION AND NOT AND POLICE PERSONNEL FILE. THE BOARD ALSO REPORTED IT HAD GONE THROUGH A PROCESS TO REALLY RE ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE CASE LOW THRESHOLDS FOR ITS INVESTIGATORS. AND THE OUTCOME OF THAT WAS THEY DETERMINED THAT BASED ON THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE. AND THE PRACTICE OF OTHER CONSUMER AFFAIRS HEALING ARTS AWARDS IT REALLY THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD WAS BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY CASES. AND THE BOARD ASSERTED THAT THE ORIGINAL THRESHOLD OF TWENTY THAT THEY HAD PROVIDED DURING THE AUDIT WAS NEVER THAT WAS NEVER MEMORIALIZES AN OFFICIAL BOARD POLICY IT WAS ACTUALLY JUST AN INFORMAL GOAL- SINCE THEN BEER AND HAS AGAIN ASSERTED THAT THEY'VE ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE OF THIS BACKLOG THAT THEY RESOLVED IT AND THEY RECENTLY IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PROVIDED ANOTHER REPORT SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WE GOT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT- PURPORTEDLY EVIDENCES THAT FACT AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE INFORMATION THAT REPORT. SO THAT WE CAN BE SATISFIED THAT BEER AND DID IN FACT RESOLVED THIS BACKLOG- ATTRACTIVELY AND WE'RE THROUGH WITH THAT PROCESS THEN AT THAT TIME IF IT PANS OUT WILL CLEAR THE RECOMMENDATION. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS IN THIS INVESTIGATION ALL CCURRED WHILE WE WERE DOING OUR SECOND AUDIT OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE BOARD'S. ROLE IN MAKING. DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE ENROLLMENT OF NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND WE ALWAYS EXERCISE DUE DILIGENCE IN VERIFYING ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ODDITIES BUT IN THIS CASE IN THE IN THE ART THAT THE MOST RECENT NOT THAT ONE NOW. WE TOOK ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RELY ON ANY INFORMATION THAT THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING PROVIDED US. SO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MOVE ON TO THAT SECOND AUDIT REPORT OUR MOST RECENT REPORTS. THAT WAS ISSUED IN JULY OF LAST YEAR. AND THAT AUDIT WAS FOCUSED ON THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING- THEIR OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S PRE LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAMS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE ON PAGE ONE. IT SUMMARIZES THE THREE KEY FINDINGS OF THAT REPORT THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS MORNING- AND TWO OF THE KEY FINDINGS REALLY RELATE TO THE BOARDS- INVOLVEMENT IN DECISIONS THAT IN FACT THAT A FACT. THE ENROLLMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S NURSING PROGRAMS AND THE THIRD ISSUE RELATES TO THE BOARD'S EFFORTS TO OVERSEE THESE NURSING PROGRAMS. SO FOR THE FIRST ISSUE. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT- B. RN'S GOVERNING BOARD DATE LIKE I SAID THEY APPROVE NEW PROGRAMS AND THEY ALSO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENTS TO APPROVE FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS. IN THESE DECISIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY AFFECT THE FLOW STUDENTS INTO THE NURSING PROGRAMS AND ULTIMATELY THEY AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF STAYS UP I'M SORRY OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS THAT THE BOARD HAS TO CONSIDER THAT INFLUENCES THESE DECISIONS IS THE SUPPLY OF NURSES. NOW BUREN DOES CONTRACT WITH THE UC SAN FRANCISCO AND TO PROVIDE A- TO BASICALLY PROVIDE EVERY TWO YEARS AS STATEWIDE NURSING- WORK FORCE FORECAST AND WE LOOKED AT THEIR MOST RECENT FORECAST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BASICALLY THE FORECAST IS SAYING THAT THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE FAIRLY WELL BALANCED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS- ON IT BASED ON A STATEWIDE FOCUS HOWEVER THE REPORT DOES NOT LOOK AT REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF NURSES THEREFORE IT OBSCURES ANY HE REGIONAL SHORTAGES AND FAX WE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF OTHER STUDIES. THAT DID HAVE A REGIONAL FOCUS AND THOSE STUDIES ARE PROJECTING THAT THERE ARE REGIONALSHORTAGES OF NURSES IN CALIFORNIA NOW AND THEY'RE PROJECTING THAT THE SHORTAGES WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE THESE FORECASTS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE BAY AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST. THAT ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE NURSING SHORTAGES IN THE FUTURE. SO BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS OUR RECOMMENDATION TO B. R. M. WAS THAT IT NEEDS TO INCORPORATE REGIONAL FORECASTS INTO THESE BIENNIAL ANALYSES- TO BETTER ENABLE ITS GOVERNING BOARD TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS. THAT WOULD ADDRESS ANY REGIONAL SHORTAGES OF NURSES. AND SKIN SO WHEN THE ITEM WENT OUT IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY BEER AND PROVIDED AN INITIAL RESPONSE AND INITIALLY WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT THIS CURRENT CONTRACT. FOR THE WORK FORCE FORECAST- WITH EXPIRING IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR AND THEY SAID THAT THE WORK UNDER THAT CONTRACT HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE. BUT THEY ASSURED US THAT THEY WOULD ASK THEIR CONTRACTOR TO INCLUDE A REGIONAL ANALYSIS IN THE REPORT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DELIVERED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER FAST FORWARD TO THEIR MOST RECENT RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. IT'S A LITTLE BIT AMBIGUOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE NEXT- FORECAST IS GOING TO INCLUDE THIS REGIONAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE WHAT B. R. AND SAID IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REVISE THEIR NEXT CONTRACT. THAT WOULD COVER THE PERIOD JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THREE JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO INCLUDE A SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE RELATED TO A REGIONAL ANALYSES- YEAH AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY ANTICIPATE TO START THAT CONTRACT PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. THE PROBLEM IS THE LANGUAGE OF THAT RESPONSE REALLY DOESN'T CLARIFY WHETHER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FORECAST THAT'S DUE SOMETIME THIS YEAR WILL INCLUDE A REGIONAL ANALYSIS OR NIGHTS. AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE A REGIONAL ANALYSIS. AND THE BOARD MAY NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION UNTIL THE NEXT. ANALYSIS IS DUE AND THAT'S NOT TILL TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WE MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD. LAST SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW SIX MONTHS LATER IT'S- IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE BOARD HAS REVISED THAT CONTRACT TO REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF NURSES. AND I WOULD PREFER TO BE OUR AND TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION TO THE COMMITTEE REGARDING WHERE THEY'RE OUT WITH THAT AND WHETHER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REGION- I'M SORRY. WORKFORCE FORECAST WILL INCLUDE A REGIONAL ANALYSIS OR NOT. HIS SECOND KEY ISSUE IN THAT REPORT IS THAT WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNING BOARD WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS TO APPROVE NEW NURSING PROGRAMS. OR TO INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THEY'RE NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS WHEN THEY MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND THIS IS A THIS IS A KEY FACTOR THAT REALLY SHOULD BE INFLUENCING THE GOVERNING BOARD'S DECISIONS BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED AND THEN OBVIOUSLY LATER AFFECTS THE SUPPLY OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE THING IS ABOUT THESE PLACEMENTS LOSSES THAT THESE ARE REQUIRED- AND NURSING PROGRAMS HAS TO SECURE THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS FLIGHTS SO THAT THEIR STUDENTS CAN GET THE REQUIRED CLINICAL PLACEMENT EXPERIENCE. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO TAKE THE STATE LICENSURE EXAM BUT THESE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES BECAUSE NOT ALL CLINICAL FACILITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THE DESIRE TO OFFER PLACEMENT SLOTS TO NURSING PROGRAM STUDENTS. CONSEQUENTLY THE NUMBER OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS CAN REALLY CONSTRAIN THE AVAILABILITY OF- PROGRAMS TO- INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT TO STUDENTS. THE OTHER THING THAT WE FOUND AS WE HEARD THAT THERE ARE- MANY NURSING PROGRAMS ARE REPORTING TO US THAT THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY DISPLACED. FROM THEIR CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BECAUSE OTHER STUDENTS TOOK THOSE SPOTS SO THERE APPEARS TO BE A SHORTAGE OF THESE CLINICAL FACILITIES THAT STUDENTS REALLY NEED TO GET THAT REQUIRED CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. TOM IS. THAT B. R. AND DOES NOT ADEQUATELY TRACKED THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SLOTS IN THESE CLINICAL FACILITIES AND THE DEMAND FOR THESE CLINICAL FACILITIES FROM THE NURSING PROGRAMS. AND SO BECAUSE IT'S NOT GATHERING THAT INFORMATION WHEN THE BOARD MAKES ITS DECISIONS IT DOESN'T HAVE CLEAR INFORMATION ON THE SUPPLY OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS. IN THE DEMAND SO IT'S NOT ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IF IT IF IT APPROVES INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND AN EXISTING PROGRAM COULD THAT RESULTS IN THE DISPLACEMENT OF STUDENTS FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT BEYOND THE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE DEMAND FOR THOSE SLOTS FROM NURSING PROGRAMS. AND ONCE THEY GET THAT WE NEED TO START PROVIDING IT TO THE BOARD SO THAT THE BOARD HAS THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT'S MAKING THESE IMPORTANT ROLE MY DECISIONS. THE B. R. AND- THEY AGREE WITH THAT ENDING AND IT MAKES SENSE TO THEM CONCEPTUALLY AND THERE JANUARY STATUS UPDATE REPORT THEY THEY DID REPORT THAT THEY HAVE REVISED. THE FORMS THAT THEY USE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF THESE DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT NURSING PROGRAMS ARE USING. HOWEVER THEY REPORTED THAT THEY WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING- REGULATIONS. THAT THEY SAY ARE NECESSARY TO REQUIRE NURSING PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. AND THEY'RE ALSO STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A DATABASE BECAUSE WE UGGESTED THAT THEY NEED TO START CAPTURING INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY THIS CLINICAL CAPACITY THE DEMAND FOR IT. PUT IT IN A DATABASE SO THEY CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THEIR BOARD AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE PUBLICLY TO NURSING PROGRAMS- BUT THAT HAS NOT HASN'T HAPPENED YET AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHETHER THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. BY APRIL BY THE APRIL FIRST DEADLINE THAT WE INCLUDE IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SO AGAIN. I WOULD DEFER TO BE OUR ENDS EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF ITS EFFORTS IN THAT CRITICAL AREA. ONE OF THE THING RELATED TO THAT. BECAUSE THIS ISSUE OF THESE THIS CLINICAL EXPERIENCES SUCH A KEY ISSUE FOR STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THIS EXPERIENCE AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO GRADUATE FROM THESE PROGRAMS AND TAKE A LICENSURE EXAM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IS WE GOT A HOLD OF OSHKOSH IS THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THEY HAVE A DOWNLOADABLE DATABASE THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF ALL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE SO WE DID. IS WE GATHER INFORMATION FROM B. R. N. FIRST SIXTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA AND FIVE AREA COUNTIES AND WHAT WE DID IS FOR THOSE SIXTEEN PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA. WE COMPARED THE FACILITIES. THAT THE PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY USING. THE POPULAR OF ALL AVAILABLE FACILITIES IN THE BAY AREA USING ARAFAT'S DATA. AND WE FOUND THAT. FOR THOSE JUST THOSE SIXTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS THEY'RE ONLY USING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE OF MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE JUST IN THE BAY AREA SUCH LESS THAN SEVENTEEN PERCENT. AND WHAT THAT IS TELLING US IS THAT THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF. FACILITIES IN JUST THOSE FIVE COUNTIES. THAT NURSING PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY NOT USING. TO PROVIDE THIS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND THIS REALLY REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY UNTAPPED SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW DOING THIS COMPARISON IS NECESSARY WE RECOGNIZE THAT- IF BEER AND STARTS TO DO THIS THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME FOLLOW UP WITH SOME OF THOSE FACILITIES BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT. THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS ARE NOT STAFFED UP TO DO IT BUT WE STILL THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE FOR B. R. AND TO PERIODICALLY OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THEY DO THIS ANNUALLY STARTING IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR. COMPARED BE CLINICAL FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S NURSING STUDENTS. TO THE TOTAL POPULATION OF FACILITIES AND THEN DO THE FOLLOW UP TO SEE IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS THAT COULD BE USED TO ALLEVIATE THIS SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT ON ENROLLMENT FOR NURSING PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING NURSING SHORTAGES. AGAIN B. R. AN AGREES CONCEPTUALLY THEY AGREE THIS IS A GOOD IDEA I THINK COULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS AND THEY'VE TOLD US IN THEIR MOST RECENT- UPDATE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THAT THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS. OF DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM SO. MAIN CITIES AS A FALL ON AND WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT WILL BE. THIRTY ISSUE IN THIS REPORT THIRD AND FINAL ISSUE IS THAT. WE FOUND THAT B. R. AND APPROVAL. AND CONTINUING OVERSIGHT OF THE- OF NURSING PROGRAMS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT NATIONAL ACCREDITING ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEALING. AND SO SPECIFICALLY WE FOUNDED B. R. INS REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSING PROGRAMS IN MANY AREAS. OVERLAP THE STANDARDS THAT ARE IMPOSED BY NATIONAL NURSING PROGRAM ACCREDITORS AND- ENTERED INTO EXTENDED THEY OVERLAP. THERE'S DUPLICATION AND IT'S INEFFICIENT. SO IF YOU AGAIN IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT PAGES TWO AND THREE OF THE HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE. IT WALKS THROUGH SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN B. R. ENDS PROCESS VERSUS THE ACCREDITORS. AND AT A HIGH LEVEL WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT B. R. ENDS PROCESS FOR APPROVING BOTH NEW PROGRAMS THE INITIAL APPROVAL PROCESS AND FOR OVERSEEING EXISTING PROGRAMS IS- THERE AND BASICALLY OVERLAPS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE STANDARDS OF THESE ARE CREDITORS. FOR EXAMPLE AS I SHOWN IN THE IN THE HANDOUTS WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT- BOTH OF THESE PROCESS SEASON BEERMAN'S PROCESS AND YOUR CREDITORS IN BOTH CASES. WE ARE VERIFYING THAT THE NURSING PROGRAM FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE QUALIFIED AND HAVE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE. BUT ALSO VERIFYING OF NURSING PROGRAM HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR BOTH ITS STUDENTS AND FACULTY. IN ADDITION THEY'RE BOTH ENSURE CURRICULUM IS COMPREHENSIVE AND INCLUDES THAT CLINICAL EXPERIENCE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THEY'RE ALSO CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT NEVER NURSING PROGRAMS ARE MAINTAINING A MINIMUM PASS RATE FOR THE LICENSURE EXAM. AND THOSE ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY VERY KEY COMPONENTS OF ANY KIND OF OVERSIGHT OF NURSING PROGRAMS BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN B. RN'S OVERSIGHT AND THE ACCREDITATION FOR EXAMPLE. BUREN'S PRIMARY MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND ENSURE THAT THESE NURSING PROGRAMS ME ARMENIAN STATE STANDARDS. WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THE ACCREDITORS THEY'RE THEY'RE BASICALLY MAKING SURE THEY'RE FOCUSING ON THE QUALITY AND PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE CREDITORS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE A NURSING PROGRAM DOWN THAT DOESN'T MEET THEIR STANDARDS WELL BURKE BOARDS OF NURSING DO YOU HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT FOR NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO GET THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING APPROVAL IN ORDER TO OPERATE WHEREAS THAT'S NOT THE CASE OR ACCREDITATION IN CALIFORNIA ACCREDITATION OF NURSING PROGRAMS IT'S OPTIONAL. AND AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT ONLY ROUGHLY HALF OF THE NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY A CREDIT. NOTWITHSTANDING WE BELIEVE THAT ALIGNING THE STATE REVIEW PROCESS WITH ACCREDITATION IT MAKES SENSE AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S UNCOMMON AND WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OTHER CALIFORNIA. HEALING ARTS BOARDS THAT ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING THAT IT RELY ON ACCREDITATION IN SOME CASES AND IN OTHER CASES THEY THEY COLLABORATE WITH THEIR THE ACCREDITORS AND SO. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THE OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THE PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT BOARD THE DENTAL HYGIENE BOARD THEY ARE ALL RELYING ON ACCREDITATION EITHER IN PLACE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR OWN OVERSIGHT. ANY OTHER THING I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT HERE TOWARDS THE END IS THAT THIS COLLABORATION BETWEEN STATES AND ACCREDITORS IT'S ENCOURAGED. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS OF NURSING. THEY RECOMMEND THE BOARDS OF NURSING SHOULD BE WORKING TOWARDS HARMONIZING- WILL PROCESS WITH THE CREDITORS BECAUSE IT MAKE SENSE. SO AS PART OF. THIS SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS IN THE REPORT WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. AS A PART OF THIS PROCESS WHETHER B. R. AND SHOULD REVISE ITS REGULATIONS TO LEVERAGE THE PORTIONS OF THE ACCREDITORS REVIEW WHERE THERE IS OVERLAP. AND WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT ACCREDITATION IS AN EXACT REPLACEMENT FOR B. R. IN THE OVERSIGHT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO RESTRUCTURE B. R. AND OVERSIGHT. TO TO REDUCE ANY DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND WE THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT TO REDUCE THE DUPLICATION. SHE WOULD SHE'D SOME COST SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCIES WHILE ALLOWING BE ARE AND TO STILL ACHIEVE ITS MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. SO IN TERMS OF BE AARON'S RESPONSE THE- THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT CONSIDER THIS AS PART OF THIS SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. BUT B. ARE INDEED INDICATE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA. AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING ANY THIS DUPLICATION OF OVERSIGHT BETWEEN THEIR OVERSIGHT NOW OUT OF THE ACCREDITORS. AND AGAIN I WOULD DEFER TO BE OUR ENDS EXECUTIVES TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THAT LATER IN THE HEARING. THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION WITHOUT I'M I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBER COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHILDREN BEFORE- IT BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT ASK A FEW. JUST A VERY FEW FOUNDATIONAL QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLAINT DELAY ISSUE WITH THE B. R. N. AND YOUR AUDIT REPORT. AND SPECIFICALLY PM FOR WHICH IS THE FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS. WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE AS BETWEEN THE B. R. IN DCA OR THE END OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WHICH OF THOSE ENTITIES ARE AGENCIES WERE. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DELAY IN PROCESSING FORMAL COMPLAINTS. YES SENATOR ROCKS SO WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CRITERIA SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUT IN OUR AUDIT WHAT WE FOUND ISTHE DELAY WAS IT APPEARED TO BE OCCURRING WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. BET THERE WAS A DELAY THERE IN TERMS OF THEY WERE JUST WERE NOT TRIAGING THESE COMPLAINTS AND EITHER ASSIGNING THEM TO THEIR OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS OR THEY'RE ACTUALLY REQUIRED THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO ASSIGN ANY COMPLAINTS. THERE ARE HIGH PRIORITY OR URGENT THOUGH SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO CONSUMER. SWORN INVESTIGATORS SO REALLY THE DELAY WAS STARTING WITH THE BOARD AND THEIR EFFORTS TO TRIAGE THESE COMPLAINTS AND EITHER ASSIGN THEM TO THEIR OWN INVESTIGATORS OR TO CONSUMER. THANK YOU- NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS IN THE SUPPLY OF A NURSES IN THE STATE. AS PART OF YOUR AUDIT BEYOND ENSURING THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN NURSING PRACTICE AND TRYING TO PREVENT A SHORTAGE OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF THE B. R. ENDS ACTIVITIES BEYOND THAT. WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE BOARD'S INTENT OR PURPOSE. WHAT IS OR ISN'T TRYING TO ENSURE THAT. THERE'S NO SURPLUS OF NURSES IN THE STATE. I SURE SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THE YEAR ENDS CONSULTANT WAS DOING IN TERMS OF THE BI ANNUAL FORECAST. THE PROBLEM AGAIN IS IT WAS A STATE WIDE FORECASTS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST FEW FORECAST THEY WERE VERY SIMILAR THIS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FORECAST PROJECTED AT BALLOT STATEWIDE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT SURPLUS OF NURSES I BELIEVE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AGAIN ON STATEWIDE LEVEL. BUT WHEN WE DRILL DOWN AND LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER REPORTS AND BY THE WAY ONE OF THESE OTHER REPORTS ALSO CAME FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO AND IN FACT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY. THE SAME CONSULTANT THAT THE BOARD USES BUT IT INCLUDED A REGIONAL ANALYSIS WHEN WE LOOKED AT BACK. WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE MANY REGIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A SHORTAGE OF NURSES RIGHT NOW AND ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE A SHORTAGE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. I GUESS MY QUESTION GOES TO THIS I MEAN AND THE BOARD'S. IS IT IS OCCASIONALLY HAVING A SURPLUS OF NURSES A BAD THING AND I WAS ASKING REALLY. IF YOU WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE DETERMINE WHAT THE MOTIVATION IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE WHERE. WE DON'T WANT TO SURPLUS OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- IT DRIVES DOWN SALARIES THAT DOES SOMETHING ELSE. MAYBE THAT WAS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF YOUR AUDIT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE USING SHORTAGE VERSUS SURPLUS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SCHOOL NEW SCHOOLS ARE APPROVED OR EXISTING SCHOOLS CAN EXPAND I UNDERSTAND SHORTAGE BEING A FACTOR I AM HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW SURPLUS IS A FACTOR IN THAT DECISION. DID THAT COME UP AT ALL IN YOUR AUDIT. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT DID THE PROBLEM THAT WE REALLY NOTED IS THAT THE BOARD DOESN'T WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS TO APPROVE A NEW NURSING PROGRAMS OR TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT THE REAL ROOT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS SO LET FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS A NOR IF THERE IS A NURSING PROGRAM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY A HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE BOARD WHEN THEY MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER TO IMPROVE THAT WRONG THEY DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THAT AREA ALREADY HAS A SHORTAGE OF NURSES OR A SURPLUS OF NURSES AND OR HOW THAT SITUATION IS PROJECTED TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE SO THAT WAS. OUR CONCERN WAS THE BOARD DOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON WHETHER THERE ARE SHORTAGES OR SURPLUSESIN SPECIFIC REGIONS IN THE STATE OKAY THANK YOU LET ME MOVE ON SO I CAN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT I GATHER FROM YOUR REPORT THAT SLOTS CLINICAL SLUDGE. MAY OCCUR AT BOTH HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AT LEAST. IN SOME CASES IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN ON ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF YOUR OTHER REPORT I FOUND YOUR CHART INTERESTING. WHERE APPARENTLY THERE WAS A SURVEY AND IF MY MATH IS CORRECT. SIXTY FOUR OF ABOUT A HUNDRED PROGRAMS THAT WERE SURVEYED REFLECTED THAT THE REASON. FOR CLINICAL SLOT DISPLACEMENT WAS SOMETHING. OTHER THAN ANOTHER NURSING PRO TO. THE FLOOD THAT THAT PART OF EUROPE. YEAH THAT'S DID WE DIDN'T THERE WERE- NUMBER OF REASON WE TOOK LOOK AT. THAT WE- THIS. AND I THAT'S OVER SHOWING IN AND OUT FIGURE ON PAGE TWO TWO. AND WE DID FOR THAT THERE WERE NO OF RE SO- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE I THINK THERE WAS. THE PROGRAMS THAT REPORTED CHOICE REPORTED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE HUNDRED NURSING STUDENTS THAT WERE DISPLACED. BUT YOU'RE RIHT IT WAS NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE THOSE STUDENTS GOT BOMBS BY STUDENTS FROM OTHER PROGRAMS THERE WERE OTHER REASONS SOMETIMES FACILITIES DECIDE THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE. THE STAFFING. TO BASICALLY MAKE THESE CLINICAL- SLOTS AVAILABLE SO CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER REASONS. THAT I'VE FOUND WITH RESPECT TO YOUR- REVIEW OF THOSE SIXTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS SORT OF FASCINATING THAT. OF THE SLOTS 82% OF ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL SLOTS IN THE BAY AREA WERE USED BUT ONLY 10% OF THE CLINIC SLOTS WERE UTILIZED FOR NURSING TRAINING BY THOSE PROGRAMS WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY MORE CLINIC AS OPPOSED TO CLINICAL CLINICS SLOTS. WERE NOT USED. I THINK WHAT WHAT WE NOTED THAT- AS HE SAID THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE ARE USING THE ACUTE CARE FACILITIES MUCH MORE THAN THEY USE IN THE OTHER CLINICS- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE GOT AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THAT'S OCCURRING. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE THINK OUR RECOMMENDATION TO AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF NOT JUST ACUTE CARE FACILITIES BUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLINICS. THE CITY AND BE OUR SPOTS DATABASE. AND I THINK WHAT B. R. N. NEEDS TO DO IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NURSING PROGRAMS IS REACH OUT TO SOME OF THESE CLINICS. AND SEE IF THERE WOULD BE WILLING TO PROVIDE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE. THE RIGHT KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE TYPES OF EXPERIENCE I THINK OUR IMPRESSION IS THAT THAT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED YET. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE DATA THAT YOU PROVIDED IN YOUR AUDIT REPORT ON CLINICS LOTS WHERE THEY ARE WHICH ONES ARE UTILIZED AND- WHICH ONES APPARENTLY OR NOT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TYPICALLY UTILIZED AT LEAST IN THE AREAS THAT YOU SURVEYED. WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING DENIED ANY. POSED NURSING PROGRAM EXPANSION OR ANY NEW SCHOOL APPLICATIONS BASED ON THIS- ONE CERTAIN CLINICAL SLOT DATA. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EVER CAME UP I DON'T BELIEVE IN OUR TESTING WE IDENTIFY THE SITUATION WHERE THE BOARD- DECIDED NOT TO APPROVE EITHER A NEW PROGRAM OR ANY INCREASE ENROLLMENT EXISTING PROGRAM BECAUSE- PROGRAM WAS GOING TO BE USING AT THE CLINIC. VIDE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE TO STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO A ACUTE CARE FACILITY. OKAY THANK YOU SIR MEMBERS COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS LET'S START FROM THE FOR CARILLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ZHOROV INVECTIVE VERY MUCH MISS UNTIL THEN- WANTED. QATAR TENSION ON A BACKGROUND PAPER PAGE TWENTY SEVEN IT'S ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND SEVEN ON THE YOUR AUDITORS REPORT. BUT SPECIFICALLY- YOU REFERENCED- ON D. FALSIFICATION OF DATA AND THEREFORE THE PENDING- CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE STATUS OF. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS NEEDS TO VERIFY INVESTIGATOR CASELOADS. YOU ALSO REFERENCED EARLIER IN YOUR IN YOUR TESTIMONY THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IT'S GIVEN THE- MOVING PIECES IS THAT STILL THE CASE TODAY WITH RESPECT TO. THE SENSE OF. OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE VERIFIED DATA THAT IS BEFORE YOU. YEAH WE DO HAVE A CONCERN BECAUSE THE BOARD- BASICALLY AGAIN RECENTLY IN I THINK NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THEY SENT US A REPORT AND SAID HEYWE'VE NOW RESOLVED THIS ISSUE WE RESOLVE THE BACKLOG BUT- AS YOU SUGGESTED DID THE REPORT IS THE SAME REPORT THAT THEY PROVIDED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THAT THEY HAD MANIPULATED AND FALSIFIED SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS WERE ACTUALLY JUST GETTING STARTED. GOING THROUGH AND VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THAT REPORT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE DATA. VERIFY THAT THAT THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN ANY REASSIGNMENTS WERE MAY AND SEVERITY FIVE THAT THE INVESTIGATORS ALL HAVE CASELOADS THAT ARE WITHIN. THEIR CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN THE BOARD'S POLICY AND SO WE'RE NOT CONFIDENT THAT THE BOARD REALLY HAS RESOLVED THIS BACKLOG. UNTIL WE GET A CHANCE TO FINISH VERIFYING AND VALIDATING WHAT THEY'RE TELLING US BASED ON DATA. THANK YOU AND GIVEN THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE ON THE- CONCLUSION OF THE FALSIFIED DATA. DO YOU HAVE SOME INSIGHTS WITHRESPECT TO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THE ROLE IF YOU LACKS AND ALSO YOUR OFFICE AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING. AT IT IT COLLABORATIVE RELATED SURE THAT WE COME OVER THE SAME. A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED BEFORE US. YEAH WE HAD TO- BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH pWE DID IS NOT ONLY ARE WE HAVING TO VERIFY AND VALIDATE THAT MOST RECENT REPORT THAT THEY SENT US BECAUSE- I MEAN QUITE HONESTLY WE REALIZE NOW THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THAT INFORMATION AT FACE VALUE AND WE ALWAYS PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE THAT WE KNOW. WITH ANYTHING THAT THE BOARDS PROVIDING WE HAVE TO PERFORM EXTRA DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE WE CAN RELY ON THAT INFORMATION- AND SO FROM OUR STANDPOINT ON A GO FORWARD BASIS INCLUDING OUR MOST RECENT AUDIT. WE HAVE BEEN- DONE EXTRA WORK WE'VE GONE EVEN FURTHER THAN WE NORMALLY WOULD IN TERMS OF DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING THAT THE BOARD PROVIDES. IT IS ACCURATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TO THE. THANK YOU CARILLO- MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR ROB AND- THANK YU TO- THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE FOR A FULL REPORT- SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT COME OUT OF THAT REPORT- SUCH AS LACK OF DATA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROPER DECISIONS IN ONE AREA AND THEN LOW CONFIDENCE IN ANOTHER AREA I DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- THE THERE WAS A LIST THAT WAS DELIVERED OF. OF DIFFERENT OTHER AGENCIES AND- BOARDS AND HOW IT WAS DESCRIBED- IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS A MUCH BETTER SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH CREDITORS SO IN. IN REFERENCE TO BE ARE IN NGUYEN IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR LACK OF SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CREDITOR IS A PHILOSOPHICAL IS IT- IS A PROCESS THAT SEEMS TO BE BROKEN. IS IT SOMETHING- THAT. MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION ON UP WHAT IS IT THAT WOULD- ADDRESS THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH THE AUDIT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH- THE BOARDS MANAGEMENT AND I THINK THEY WANT THEIR THEY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT THEIR- THEIR MISSION IS DIFFERENT THAT THEIR PRIMARY MISSION IS ALL ABOUT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC ENSURING THAT. NURSING PROGRAMS MEET STANDARDS WHICH WHICH IS FINE- BUT WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE ACCREDITORS THERE'S TWO PRIMARY NATIONAL CREDITORS OUT THERE AND WE FOUND THAT. THE ACCREDITORS OFTENTIMES IN THEIR REVIEWS THEY ARE ALSO CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THAT NURSING PROGRAMS ARE HEARING TO STATE REQUIREMENTS. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT DURING THE AUDIT I THINK. THE BOARD WAS A LITTLE LESS OPEN TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE WAS A DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS. AND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE LIKE YOU SAID TO HAVE MORE OF A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP AND TO REALLY I THINK WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IS THE BOARD SHOULD BE COLLABORATING WITH YOUR CREDITORS SO THAT BOTH SIDES CAN STREAMLINE YOUR PROCESS SEES AND ELIMINATE THE DUPLICATION. BY THE TIME THAT WE FINISH THE AUDIT IN THE BOARD'S ACTUAL OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT. THEY I THINK THEY HAD SORT OF COME ALONG AND AGREED THAT IT MAKES SENSE AND EVEN THOUGH WE MADE A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION OF THE LEGISLATURE. CONSIDER REVISING THE BOARD'S RAGS TO ELIMINATE HIS DUPLICATION AT THE END OF BOARD SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS THEY LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE OVERLAP. AND COME UP WITH A PLAN TO ADDRESS IT. THANK YOU. WHILE I'M WAITING FOR I THINK DOCTOR PAN WHAT CHIRLA DO YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS. JUST ONE OTHER ONE A IF OF WHAT I KNOW THAT WE'RE WAITING FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE MEMBER I DON'T KNOW FROM THE FIRST TELL THEM THIS MIGHT BEAPPROPRIATE FOR YOU AS WELL TO OR IF YOU HAVE SOME INSIGHTS. AS YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR DUTY IT'S OUR JOB ON THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE USING IS UNCOMFORTABLE- IT BY NO MEANS DO WE DERIVE ANY PLEASURE IN HIGHLIGHTING THE DEFICIENCIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE ULTIMATELY ALL THE STATE WHAT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO BE STEWARDS OF PUBLIC TRUST. I WAS JUST WE WERE JUST RECENTLY INFORMED THAT- TO THE TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD HAVE THE WORD REPRESENTATION FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE FEARS. HEARING SOME PORTS IN BUREAUS AND DEPARTMENTS CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUT WERE JUST MADE AWARE THAT I'M AGENCY HAS DISCOURAGED THE PUBLIC BOARD MEMBER FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS HEARING- THERE. ONE COULD CONCLUDE AND INTERPRET THAT AS THINGS SUCH THAT THERE IS NOT THE TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE THESE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THESE ISSUES TOO SO AGAIN IT WAS JUST MADE UP OF WHICH IS MADE AWARE THAT THE AGENCY HAS DISCOURAGED. PUBLIC REPRESENTED FROM THE BOARD OF REGISTERED. NURSING NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING. IS THAT THE NEW YORK AS A TO. HOW MIGHT YOU SUGGEST WE AND- THE LACK OF PARTICIPATION FROM ABOARD MATTER IN AN APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT HEARING SUCH AS THE SUNSET REVIEW. I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN COMMENT ON THAT- I'M NOT SURE- WHAT THE NORMAL PROTOCOL IS THERE- I WOULD HOPE THAT THE AGENCY AND THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING SIGN EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM WOULD BE ON THE SAME PAGE. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT- WHEN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM THE BOARD TESTIFIES LOOK AT LATER AT THAT- MAYBE SHE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO NOT ONLY MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BUT ALSO THE PERSPECTIVE OF AGENCIES SO I WOULD HOPE THAT. B. R. ENDS EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS REPRESENTED POSITION NOT JUST OF THE BOARD BUT ALSO AGENCY. DOLLARS. I JUST HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION SO- IN REGARDS TO THAT SEVENTY URGENT COMPLAINTS WAS THAT YOUR OFFICE THAT SET THEM TO BE URGENT- WAS THAT THE BEER AND WHEN THEY RE DID THE DATA. RE ENTERED THE NUMBERS TO DATE. CREATE THE ORDER. YEAH THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING THEY HAVE CRITERIA WHERE THEY ASSIGN THESE COMPLAINTS- DIFFERENT LEVELS OF- PRIORITY RANGING FROM HIGH PRIORITY ACTUALLY URGENT HIGH PRIORITY AND THEY HAVE TWO CATEGORIES THAT ARE MORE ROUTINE SO THAT WAS BASED ON THE BOARD'S OWN IDENTIFICATION AND OWN CRITERIA THAT THESE SEVENTY COMPLAINTS WERE HIGH PRIORITY OR OF AN URGENT NATURE. AND AT THE MINIMUM THEY'RE BEING ADDRESSED IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT AND THAT'S THAT REQUIREMENT COMES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THAT THESE THINGS B. R. SIGNED ACTUALLY THE INVESTIGATION AS COMPLETED AND RESOLVED WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SO IF THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WE HAVE SEVENTY URGENT COMPLAINTS. EXISTING I HAVE TO WONDER IF MAYBE THE BEER AND IS NOT THE BEST. AGENCY TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE PUBLIC. SEVENTY URGENT COMPLAINTS COULD MEAN A MULTITUDE OF THINGS AND SO ON THESE ARE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF SOMETHING. ON VERY CONCERNING THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT. THANK YOU MEMBER DOLLY SENATOR MEN. I DON'T HAVE MY HAND UP BUT- I'M I'M HAPPY I GUESS MY I DID HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH SINCE YOU CALLED ON ME- OR MAYBE COMMENT YOU KNOW I YA COME FROM THIS IS ALL NEW TO ME BUT I COME FROM A BACKGROUND-I STARTED DEBT SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION I'VE WORKED ON ACCOUNTING FRAUD CASES IN MY PAST AND- THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR YOU DESCRIBE IF IT HAPPENED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR- WE WOULD SEE. A LOT OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS YOU'D SEE ARE TYPICALLY A REPLACEMENT OF THE BOARD YOU SEE- INDEPENDENT AUDITS- INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO LIKE AND I GUESS YOU KNOW I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR COMMENT- MISTER CHILDREN JUST ON. ON WHETHER MORE ACTION'S ALONG THESE LINES ARE PROGRAM. I CA SAY THAT- WE WERE- VERY- THIS IS A BIG DEAL THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN WE'RE CONDUCTING AUDITS SO IT WAS. AGAIN FOR US TO HAVE. AN AUDIT C. LIKE THE BOARD. TELL US THAT THEY'VE RESOLVED A VERY IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION. AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TO ASSIGN THESE COMPLAINTS SO THEY COULD BE RESOLVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEY HAVE AN AUDIT T. TELL US THEY DID THAT. AND THEN WE GO BACK AND SAY WELL WE NEED SOME SUPPORT GIVE US THE EVIDENCE AND THEN TO HAVE THEM DO THAT. AND THEN LATER TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS ALL BOGUS DATA AND THAT THEY HAD MANIPULATED IT WAS VERY- OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNING WE TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY WE STARTED AN INVESTIGATION RIGHT AWAY. AND AS I SAID IT ALL OVER FUTURE DEALINGS WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. WE ARE GOING TO BE EVEN MORE VIGILANT THAN WE NORMALLY ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN RELY ON ANY INFORMATION THAT THEY PROVIDE US. BUT I THINK I WANTED TRYING TO GET TO IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SIX IS THAT REALLY A CULTURE. THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC ABSOLUTE TOP TO BOTTOM EIGHT EIGHT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SOUNDS LIKE. A BOARD THAT IS. NOT FULLY DETERMINED TO YOU KNOW REMEDY THE WRONGS THAT AND IT IS YOU DESCRIBE THIS ISN'T A GREGIS PROBLEM I MEAN THIS THIS REACHES I BELIEVE CRIMINAL LEVELS OF- FRIED. AND YET WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE YOU'RE DESCRIBING A WHOLE HEARTED EFFORT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IS THAT. IS THAT SOUND RIGHT TO YOU. WELL I KNOW THAT- B. R. AND IN THEIR IN THEIR RESPONSE THEY DID OF THE THREE EXECUTIVES THAT REALLY. KIND OF MASTERMIND THIS CLAN TO REALLY DECEIVE US BY MANIPULATING DATA. YEAH THEY DID. THEY DID DISMISS TWO OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AND ONE HAD ALREADY LEFT- ONE THING I COULD PROBABLY DO RIGHT NOW IS. IS BASICALLY DIFFERENT THIS OVER TO YOU MR TRUMP. SHE WAS THE- MANAGER THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND SHE MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A LITTLE MORE COMMENTS ON ON BILLBOARDS- REACTION TO THE FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION. CNN TRONG THE BY AND THE CHIEF OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND TO FOLLOW UP MISTER CHILDREN SAID- AND TO ANSWER- THE QUESTION AT HAND IS THAT- WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT AT THE TIME A CRIMINAL MATTER- BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF DATA THAT WAS TURNED OVER TO US. SO WE DIDN'T LOOK AT IT FROM A CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE- THAT'S SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY THAT WE- COULD CONSIDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION- BUT BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE INVESTIGATION WE DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS A CRIMINAL MATTER AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION. BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM WHETHER OR NOT A CRIMINAL SANCTIONS ARE PROBABLY I GUESS I GUESS THE QUESTION. IS DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS A CULTURAL PROBLEM. WITH THE B. R. AND- AND DO YOU ALSO IS THAT AS A FOLLOW UP FEEL LIKE THE BOARD IS. ACTING DILIGENTLY AND AGGRESSIVELY TO ROOT OUT THE CAUSES OF THIS TYPE OF PROBLEMS AND IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. BECAUSE I GUESS MY ANALOG HERE MIGHT SORT REFERENCE POINT. IS DID THIS HAPPEN IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE WOULD BE REPLACING THE ENTIRE BOARD WE WILL BE LOOKING TO- YOU KNOW TURN EVERYTHING OVER AND I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ON ITIS. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THAT THERE'S AN AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE SO THAT THIS TYPE OF BOB MISREPRESENTATION. I IN THIS GROSS. NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW DOESN'T HAPPEN. I BELIEVE THAT B. R. ENNIS TAKING. EFFECTIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT I DON'T THINK OF THAT I. HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE MAKING. A CONCERTED EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE BOARD- TO CHANGE. THE CULTURE AT THE BOARD- I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR REFERENCE TO A PRIVATE PRACTICE- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LEGAL. REQUIREMENTS AND THAT MIGHT HINDER- B. R. ENDS TO. TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION- AT AS TIMELY AS YOU MIGHT SEE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THANK YOU I THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU CENTER MEANT- BEFORE I GO TO DOCTOR PAN WHO WILL BE NEXT I'VE I WAS JUST STRUCK BY A SENTENCE IN THE YARD REPORT ON PAGE THIRTY ONE. ON THE ISSUE OF. APPROVAL VERSUS ACCREDITATION IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE APPROVAL AUTHORTIES AND- THE CREDITORS AND THE STATEMENT IS. WE ARE IN THE SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT IT WILL NOT ACCEPT REPORTS PREPARED FOR ACCREDITING BODIES. MR UNDER WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. YEAH WE DON'T WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT PERSPECTIVE- TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT B. B. R. ANY IN THEIR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION IS ASKING FOR CERTAIN SUPPORT IN CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND YOU HAVE A CREDITORS THAT ARE ASKING FOR THE SAME INFORMATION IT MADE NO SENSE TO US Y. A. B. R. AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO YOUR CREDITORS BECAUSE THERE. IS SAME DOCUMENTS AS I SAID EARLIER IN MANY CASES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CREDITORS AND THE BOARD ARE BASICALLY CHECKING IN THEIR OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS ARE THE SAME. OKAY WELL THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I THOUGHT THANK YOU MISTER UNDER DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITOR SO MUCH FOR THEIR PRESENTATION- I'VE TO- HOPEFULLY BRIEF QUESTIONS UP FIRST IS TO CLARIFY WHAT WAS SUPERIOR TO TIME IN WHICH- THE SAKE TELL ME THE STATE'S ONLY TO EXPECT THAT THE STAFF ACTUALLY- J. SYMPHONY DELETED THE CASE DATA WHAT'S SO YOU'RE DOING THE AUDIT SO. BETWEEN WHICH DATE TO WHICH DATE MONTH AND YEAR I DON'T NEED TO GET HAPPENED WHAT THROUGH THE TIME. SO THE AUDIT NGUYEN OUTS IN- THE AUDIT WHEN ALEXANDER JULY I'M SORRY. THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND- B. R. AND DIDN'T COME BACK TO US TO SAY THEY HAD FULLY IMPLEMENTED THIS AND STILL- TO THAT THIS IS A NO I'M ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE AUDIT WHERE YOU SHOWED THAT THEY MANIPULATE THE KEY STATES THAT THE EXECUTIVE STATE THE DATA SO ESSENTIALLY ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE DATA SO THAT TOOK PLACE AT WHICH- WHICH WHICH YEAR. AT THE LAST. SO THEY THEY PROVIDED THE REPORT AND BASICALLY THE FALL OUT OF FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. YEAH BUT WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM THE ONE THAT WHISTLEBLOWER. IN TILL THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE WAS ABOUT A FOURTEEN MONTH LAG BETWEEN THE TIME THAT. B. R. AND- MANIPULATED THE DATA TO PROVIDE THE FALSIFIED REPORT AND THEN IT WAS LIKE. TWELVE TO FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER. THEIR WHISTLEBLOWER CAME OUT AND REYES THE ALLEGATION OKAY SO THAT THE SERVICE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN. THIS MANIPULATION TOOK PLACE. AT OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT- NOT REALLY TO THIS BUT- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOOK A LOOK AT THE CLINICAL SITES I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT- SAYING THAT YOU LOOKED AT. ALTHOUGH AS A SOMEONE WHO'S A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR MYSELF THAT'S A DEAL CLINICAL SITES. I KNOW YOU LOOK AT OSHKOSH DATA WAS THERE ANY EFFORT ATTEMPTS MADE AND I KNOW FOR A ON THE HARD TO DO. TO EVALUATE THE WILLINGNESS OF VARIOUS SITES TO ACTUALLY ACCEPTS TRAINEES BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY LICENSED CLINICAL SITE- LET'S SEE. HOW MANY LICENSED- HELPER. SITES TO ARE TRACKED CYCLE SAFETY BUT THEY MAY NOT ALL WANT TO HAVE A NURSE TRAINEE SO. THAT MAY ALSO AFFECT SO. DID YOU JUST LOOK AT THE OXFORD DATA OR DID YOU WAS THERE ANY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO ABOUT TAKE A LOOK AT. EITHER THE WILLINGNESS OR THE EXISTING- OR THE DEGREE TO WHICH OFFICIALLY BE ACTUALLY WILLING TO TAKE ON A NURSE TRAINEE AS A CLINICAL TRAINING SITES. WE KNOWLEDGE CENTER REPORT THAT- EVEN THOUGH WE DID IN THE BAY AREA IDENTIFY. A LARGE NUMBER OF- FACILITIES THAT WERE NOT BEING USE WEEK WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE IN OUR RECORDS THAT IT COULD BE THAT MANY OF THOSE- FACILITIES THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY DON'T WANT TO OFFER CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WHAT'S THE NURSING PROGRAM STUDENTS WHERE THEY-DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO DO IT THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF REASONS. AND CERTAINLY THE BOARD BROUGHT THAT UP I MEAN THEY AGREED THAT YES WE IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF FACILITIES AND IN ONE AREA THE AREA. THAT WE'RE NOT BEING TAPPED. BUT THEY MADE THE SAME CASE THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE UNUSED FACILITIES WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE OR WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY OUR POINT WAS JUST BECAUSE WE IDENTIFIED JUST MISS ONE REGION SO MANY FACILITIES THAT WERE NOT BEING USED. WE THINK IT'S AT LEAST WORTH WHILE FOR B. R. AND TO WORK WITH THE NURSING PROGRAMS AND GO THROUGH THIS COMPARISON AND IDENTIFY THESE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT AREN'T BEING USED AND REACH OUT TO SOME OF THEM HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS. TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT BEING USED THAT WOULD BE AMENABLE TO OFFERING TOP CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE NOT APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE FINDING THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT REALLY BEEN CONSIDERING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS A PROOF- TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THE PEOPLE CASH ACTUALLY CAN'T COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CLINICAL SITES. SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THAT AND APPROVALS IS VERY PROBLEM IS VERY TROUBLESOME TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT DON'T WANT TWENTY STOCK THE SAME TIME I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT UNFORTUNATELY MANY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES NO LONGER WANT TREES BECAUSE THEY COST MONEY I MEAN IT THE EVEN IF YOU DON'T TO PAY FOR THE TRAINEES THAT THAT THE OVERHEAD TIME FOR TEACHING AND- IT'S AT- ENDS AND IN FACT- THAT'S A CHRONIC PROBLEM NOT ONLY NURSING BUT ACROSS THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS WHERE DOES FEELING FEWER. HEALTH FACILITIES WILLING TO TAKE ON TRAINEES BECAUSE OF. THE EXPENSE AND DAHLE CERTAIN OF SIDE KNOW DESTROY. THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH A TREE NEED. ANY OTHER SKILL LEVEL CETERA. AND- SO THAT'S A- FROM BUT CERTAINLY AGREETHAT THE BOARD. SHOULD THE CERTAINLY EVALUATE THAT BECAUSE NOTHING ELSE WE WANNA BE SURE A TRAINEE IS ABLE ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING THEY CAN'T GET A CLINICAL SITES AND- WORKED AT THEM THAT'S- THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT STUDENTS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU A DOCTRINE MR TOLD JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I MEAN. DIDN'T YOU AND YOUR IN THE COURSE OF YOUR AUDIT. FIND IN DETERMINE THAT THE BOARD WAS NOT. UTILIZING THE DATA THAT IS. IT HAD COLLECTED CAN TO PERIODICALLY pHIS OF THE PROCESS EITHER FOR THE APPLE OF A NEW PROGRAM. OR FOR THE EXPRESS OF THE PRO HAVE TO DO WITH CLINICAL SLOTS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF. CLINICAL THE STATE. THAT'S CORRECT MISTER CHAIRMAN IN ORDER FOR THE BOARD TO EVEN. DO A COMPARISON OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH- FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED BY NURSING PROGRAMS. VERSUS THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF POTENTIAL FACILITIES. THEY FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A HANDLE ON WHAT FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED ACROSS THE STATE BY THE START STATE'S NURSING PROGRAMS. AND THEY NEED DATA ON HOW MANY SLOTS ARE BEING USED. VERSUS HOW MANY SLOTS TO THE NURSING PROGRAMS NEED SO WE CAN MINIMIZE THIS RISK OF STUDENTS BEING DISPLACED. BUT AS YOU BUT AS YOU SAID RIGHT NOW THE BOARD DOESN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A HANDLE RIGHT NOW ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH- NURSING PROGRAMS ARE USING FACILITIES AND WHICH ONES THEY'RE USING. AND THAT'S HAS TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY CAN COMPARE IT TO THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF FACILITIES IN THE STATE. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES. COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE FLOOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. O. K. SAYING NONE OF CALLING SEWER PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE WE.

ON HIS BEHALF IF THAT IS OKAY WITH YOU GUYS THAT'S CERTAINLY ACCEPTABLE BUT I HAVE TO COMMENT- I DON'T SPEAK FOR MY FUTURE LOW ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE BUT- IT'S RATHER UNUSUAL NOT TO HAVE A MEMBER OF THE BOARD PRESENT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT A BOARD MEMBER MIGHT HAVE A- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT.

IN YOUR IN THE HOT SEAT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU YEAH- SO GOOD MORNING TERROR OFTEN SHARE LOW IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES WE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. AS I SAID IN MY STATEMENT JUST A MINUTE AGO MY NAME IS LORETTA MELBY AND I AM THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE BOARDS KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED TO A TELEWORK ENVIRONMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE CO IN EIGHTEEN PANDEMIC. I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCIES AND EFFECTIVENESS IN THE NEW TELEWORK ENVIRONMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE STRIDES IN THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION EFFORTS OF STAFF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE POSITIONS THAT STAFF OR NEW OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. WE IDENTIFIED IN IMPLEMENTED CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE LICENSING PROCESSING TIMELINES AND ENHANCE OUR STATUTORY MANDATE ACTIVITIES INVOLVING NURSING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. WE FOR THE THIRD OF SUCCESS TOWARDS THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION'S EFFORTS OF AUTOMATION. WE LAUNCH THE EFFORTS TO CENTRALIZE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTRACTS. FLEET MANAGEMENT BUDGETS AND CORRESPONDENCE. WE ENHANCED OUR COMMUNICATION AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS THREE STEPS- SUCH AS THE BEER AND NEWSLETTER. PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE GOVERNMENTAL AND ENTITIES AND PARTICIPATION IN TRAINING AND CONFERENCES. WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCINGUNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO LICENSE SURE STREAMLINING OF OUR PROCESS SEES AND PROVIDING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE TO OUR LICENSEES AND CONSUMERS. AS THE BEER AND LOOKS TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE EXCITED TO FIND NEW WAYS TO WORK. CREATING A CULTURE OF TRANSPARENCY IN SOLIDARITY STRENGTHENING OUR COMMUNICATION WITH OUR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FOUNDATION FOR PROVIDING EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ENSURING FAIR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. I AM HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. WELL- FOR YOU MAY AS WELL BE LET ME AS OF. COUPLE OF. CORE QUESTIONS BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES CHAIR LOW ON MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS YOU I'M SURE YOU HEARD SOME OF MY INITIAL QUESTIONS OF THE- STATE AUDITOR AND- I'M GOING TO ASK THEM OF YOU WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT DELAYS OF. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL AS I'M SURE YOU REALIZE IN THIS BOARD ENVIRONMENT FOR BOARDS TO HAVE DIFFICULTY. MEETING ENFORCEMENT TARGETS IN THIS PM FOR. OF THIS PERFORMANCE A METRIC THAT THE DCA IS COME UP WITH- THIS BOARD PEERS TO BE NO EXCEPTION. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S COMMENT THAT THE- REASON FOR THE FAILURE TO MEET THE TARGET LARGELY IS THE RESULT OF THE R. ENDS IN ACTION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROCESSING OF FORMAL COMPLAINTS THE FIVE HAVEN'T PUT WORDS IN HIS MOUTH. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF- I THINK THAT IS A TWO FOLD ANSWER AND SO AT THE TIME OF THE AUDIT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN YES I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT- WHAT WAS FOUND. ON THE AUDIT WAS ACCURATE AND IT WAS A PROBLEM THAT OUR BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING- WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR- THAT HAS CHANGED EAST- WE DID SUBMIT EVIDENCE THAT- WE ARE IMPROVING OUR TIMELINES- WE ARE NOW TO TWENTY MONTHS AND THE GOAL IS EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SO WE'VE MADE QUITE A BIT OF PROGRESS IN THAT TOO- CLOSING OUT THE CASES IN THAT TIME LINE. AND I THINK AS WITH ALL OF THE OTHER BOARD CENTER AND THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY MEETING THAT THAT COLLABORATIVELY STREAMLINE BINDING ACROSS THE SEAS AND REALLY DOING SOME DEEP DIVES TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE THE HOLD UPS ARE- CAN BRING US TO AND THE OTHER BOARDS AND BUREAUS TO THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TIMELINE- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DO COME ACROSS THIS RECORD ATTAINMENTS- IN GETTING THEIR APPROPRIATE RECORDS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND THAT DOESN'T JUST STOP WITH US THAT DOES HAPPEN WITH- DAY DEAR BYE- AG'S AND OTHERS- WHAT WOULD HELP US. IS TO- GET A SWORN LIMITED PEACE OFFICER STATUS FOR OUR- SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET SOME DOCUMENTS A LOT FASTER- BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR PROCESSES RECEIVE MONEY AND WE'RE MAKING. GREAT STRIDES WHAT. WHAT TWO THINGS ONE CAN GO. THANK YOU FOR IT. BUT TO MAY HAVE HEARD ME SUGGEST TO OTHER BOARDS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT I THINK IT THE DCA AND THE BOARDS NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPLIT UP. AT FIRST I TO HAVE INTO IT IN TIME TARGETS WITHIN PM FOR. AND BE ABLE TO SPLIT UP THE TIME AND EXPLAIN THE DELAY. BETWEEN THE BOARD THE DCA IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO IF IT'S SOMETHING OTHER THAN DELAY AT THE BOARD LEVEL WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOCUS ON IT AND HELP YOU FIX IT. SO YOU IS A BORDER NOT. A TARGETED AND TAGGED WITH THE COMPLETE. RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DELAY THAT MAY NOT BE TOTALLY WITHIN YOUR CONTROL SECONDLY WOULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THIS NEED FOR. A PEACE OFFICER STATUS WHAT DOCUMENTS TYPICALLY DO YOU TRY TO OBTAIN AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE A PEACE OFFICER WITH ALL THAT GOES ALONG WITH. PEACE OFFICER STATUS COMPENSATION BENEFITS TRAINING AND ALL THE REST. INSIDE A NON. TRADITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. YEAH I AGAIN- SENATOR UP I WILL GO AHEAD AND- TRY TO ANSWER THAT IT WAS A COUPLE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS SO- I MAY HAVE YOU- REPEAT THE LAST QUESTION OR THE FIRST QUESTION IF I IF I DON'T. ANSWER THE QUESTION IS WHY WHY PEACE OFFICERS INSIDE THE BORDER REGISTERED NURSING TO GET INFORMATION. YES SO RIGHT NOW WE DO SEE- THAT WE HAVE DELAYS IN RECEIVING CERTIFIED COURT DOCUMENTS URESTI CONVICTION RECORDS THAT INCREASES THE COST AND DECREASES EFFICIENCIES AND- WITH THAT WE MIGHT GET NO RESPONSE- FROM OBTAINING DOCUMENTS INCLUDING CONSENT TO RELEASE MEDICAL RECORDS- SO WITH THAT STATUS- AND IT'S A LIMITED PEACE OFFICER STATUS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS WHERE IT DOESN'T CHANGE SALARY. AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE BENEFITS- SO IT IS NO ADDITIONAL COST- IN WITH THAT- LIMITED SWORN PEACE OFFICER STATUS- IT DOES IMPLORE- THOSE AGENCIES TO RESPOND A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENTLY. THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS ON THAT AND IF THEY DON'T WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPLORE THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL UP OUTSIDE OF THE SETTING. YOU YOU YOU HEARD MY QUESTIONS ON THE SUPPLY ISSUE AND THE SURVEYS AND WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT AND THEN DEBATE WHETHER THERE IS A SHORTAGE OR AN OVERSUPPLY. OF NURSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU HEARD MY QUESTION TO THE AUDITOR I BELIEVE YOU KNOW BEYOND ENSURING. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THE BOARD ENSURING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH RESPECT TO THE NURSING PRACTICE. AND TRYING TO PREVENT. A SHORTAGE OF NURSES IN THE STATE. WHICH OF COURSE IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY WHAT'S THE PURPOSE IN THE BOARD APPARENTLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NOT A SURPLUS OF NURSES. IN THE STATE AS PART OF THE APPROVAL OF NEW PROGRAMS EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS. A DEBATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IS THAT A CLEAR QUESTION. IT IS IT DEFINITELY HAS THANK YOU- ACTUALLY WANT TO KIND OF A- ANSWERED THAT- BY SAYING THAT I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE BOARD IS TRYING TO LIMIT A SURPLUS- THAT'S NOT ANYTHING MY UNDERSTANDING I'M AN ARE IN MYSELF- AND I'VE BEEN ARE IN FOR TWENTY YEARS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS A GOAL THAT- MY BOARD HAS- I CAN DEFINITELY SPEAK THAT THAT'S NOT A GOAL THAT MY BOARD STAFF HAS. LATER ACTUALLY SHARE. THE REPRESENT. BRING WHAT I'VE READ I UNDERSTOOD THAT TO BE A FACTOR. IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. NOT IN A SURPLUS IN NURSING BUT WHEN LOOKING AT CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT- IF YOU HAVE TOO MANY STUDENTS IN ONE CONCENTRATED AREA IT DOES AFFECT THE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION AND ACCOMMODATE THE STUDENTS AND IT ALSO AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS TO PROGRESS IN GRADUATE. AND I GET TO MY QUESTION ON THAT THE SECOND BUT IT WAS ALL IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE MATERIAL IS SORT OF TWO SEPARATE ISSUES THAT ARE CONSIDERED- DURING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS I UNDERSTAND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. I UNDERSTAND. SHORTAGE BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND SHORTAGE OKAY I'LL MOVE ON BECAUSE I WANT MY COLLEAGUES TO HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ASK MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUE WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHERE WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE SIXTEEN PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA- 82% OF THE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL SLOTS FOR USE BUT ONLY TEN PERCENT. OF THE CLINIC NOT CLINICAL BUT CLINIC SLOTS WERE USED. IS IT PROVE THAT. CLINIC SLOTS GO UNUSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO CLINICAL PLACEMENT OF NURSING TRAINEES. YES THAT IS TRUE THERE ARE MANY MANY CLINICS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT USED FOR- CLINICAL EXPERIENCE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE REGISTERED NURSING STUDENT- THE GOAL FOR PREPARING A REGISTERED NURSING STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA IS TO PROPERLY EQUIP THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE REQUISITE SKILLS TO BE A SAFE PRACTICING OUR AND- THAT REQUIREMENTS- IS AIDED BY THAT DIRECT PATIENT CARE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. MOST- LET ME CORRECT THAT MANY CLINICS- MAY NOT EMPLOY IN OUR AT- MAY NOT HAVE THOSE KIND OF EXPERIENCES AVAILABLE FOR AN HOUR AND A LOT OF- PHYSICIAN CLINICS HAVE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE- SOME EMPLOYEE- A LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE BUT RARELY DO THEY EMPLOY A SPECIFIC R. AND FOR- ARE IN SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE ATTAINMENT. THEREFORE A CLINIC THERE'S MANY REASONS THAT CLINIC MAY NOT BE YEARS IT COULD BE THAT- THERE WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE ARE AN OVERSIGHT THAT- THE CLINIC IT MAY NOT. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL EXPERIENCES THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCES ARE SET FORTH BY THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION WHEN THEY WRITE THEIR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS- AND THEN IT JUST MAY BE THE INABILITY OF THE THAT CLINIC TO ACCOMMODATE THAT I WAS- MENTIONED EARLIER- BY ONE OF THE MEMBERS HERE. THAT SOME CLINICS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO DO THAT- THERE IS A SUPPLY ISSUE WE DID SEE THAT EXPRESSED WITH COOPERATE WITH GETTING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PPE ESE- AND THAT- TYPICALLY COMES FROM THAT INSTITUTION THAT IS PROVIDING THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND SO- DO YOU TO THE ORIENTATION THAT HAS TO BE PROVIDED AT THE TIME AWAY FROM STAFF AND PRODUCTIVITY. THE INCREASED ADEQUATE MAKE YOU STANDS- AND NOW SPACE WITH THE SOCIAL DISTANCING- IT HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR ACADEMIC PARTNERS TO OBTAIN CLINICAL. FACILITIES FOR THEIR STUDENTS. WELL I WOULD HAVE THAT YOU AGREE THE- DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THE REGARDLESS OF THESE STUDIES THAT I SEE- AT LEAST IN SOME PARTS OF THE STATE WILL CONTINUE- AND THE SHORTAGE OF. HOSPITAL **** PAROLEE. PROBABLY MORE SO IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THE BEER IN TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CLINICS SETTINGS TO SEE WHAT REALLY IS THE STORY. WHAT TRULY IS APPROPRIATE AND INAPPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF UGH CLINICAL SLOT. CLINIC SLOTS USAGE. THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE CLINICS WHETHER THEIR URGENT CARE CLINICS OR OTHER- CLINICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. AS MANY TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AS WE CAN FOR OUR NURSING STUDENTS NOW I REALIZE AND RECOGNIZE IT GIVEN THE SUBJECTS THAT. NURSE NURSE STUDENTS MISSING STUDENTS HAVE TO TRAIN IN THAT SOME NEED TO BE DONE SOME TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABSOLUTELY IN THE HOSPITAL'S PERHAPS MUCH OF IT BUT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME OF IT THAT CAN BE DONE. ELSEWHERE LET ME TURN BRIEFLY BEFORE I PUT MY COLLEAGUES TO SLEEP TO. LICENSE RECIPROCITY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO. MILITARY OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO- TRANSFER INTO THIS STATE WITH THEIR- MILITARY MEMBER SPOUSE. FULLY LICENSED- CERTIFICATED DEPENDING ON THE OCCUPATION WITH. APPROPRIATE TRAINING LICENSURE AND EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES. BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES IN OUR BACKGROUND PAPER. NOTES THAT THE RECIPROCITY PROCESS. CAN BE LENGTHY. HOW LENGTHY IS THE RECIPROCITY PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IF IT IS WHY. I HAVE SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS- IF YOU DON'T MIND IS THAT OKAY CERTAINLY. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY RECIPROCITY WE HAD TO BUSINESS PROCESS SEES AND ONE OF THEM IS CALLED ENDORSEMENTS AND THAT IS- WHERE OKAY OKAY GOOD SO IS THAT THE ONE THAT YOU WANT SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT- HAVING OUT OF STATE OURENSE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA ROAD RUNNER. YOU CALLED ENDORSEMENT IN A LOT OF BUSINESS WE CALLED RECIPROCITY YOU AT LEAST HAVE ENDORSEMENT WE'VE GOT NONE OF THAT IN THE LAW BUSINESS BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I'LL BE EVEN CLEARER. IN THE CASE OF NURSES WERE A NURSE COMPLETES A TRAINING PROGRAM TAKES A NATIONAL EXAM PASSES THE TRAINING PROGRAM IS LICENSED IN ANOTHER STATE AND PRACTICES SUCCESSFULLY IN ANOTHER STATE. PRESUMABLY WITHOUT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WITH A CLEAN RECORD INCOMES TO CALIFORNIA WHY DOES IT TAKE ANY LENGTH OF TIME AT ALL IN TERMS OF PUTTING THAT NURSE TO WORK. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- A LOT OF THAT LATE THE TIME COMES FROM THE FINGERPRINT CHECKS THAT ARE DONE TO DOJ- ARE OUT OF STATE NURSES THAT DO NOT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. CANNOT COMPLETE THE LIVE SCAN FINGERPRINTING PROCESS AND THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT WHAT IS CALLED A HARD CARD. THAT HARD CARD IS REQUESTED BY THE B. R. N. WEEKS MAIL IT OUT TO THEM BECAUSE IT IS NOT ELECTRONIC.WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THAT MAIL TO GET TO THEM THEY THEN HAVE TO GO INCOMPLETE THAT THE HARD CARD PROCESS ACTS MAYBE THEIR LCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO MAIL THAT AGAIN BACK INTO US- THE DOJ STANDARDS THE LIVE SCAN PROCESS WHICH IS A VERY QUICK PROCESS CAN ONLY BE DONE IF YOU WERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEREFORE THAT DELAYS THAT TIME FRAME WHAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO IS OUR ENDORSEMENT PUBLICATIONS RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT- AS OF JANUARY- WE ONLY HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE. PEOPLE WAITING TO BE PROCESSED IN JANUARY AND WE ARE WAITING FOR THOSE FINGERPRINT RESULTS TO COME BACK EACH MORNING WE PULL REPORT TO SEE WHAT NEW FINGERPRINT RESULTS HAVE CAME IN. AND THEY IF THEY ARE CLEAR THEY HAVE NO PRIOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION ON THEIR LICENSE THEY ARE THEN ISSUED AN ENDORSEMENT APPLICATION IF THEY MEET OUR- EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. AND IF NOT THEY ARE ISSUED A TEMPORARY LICENSE SO THAT THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY HELP- OUR CALIFORNIA PATIENTS WHILE THEY PROVIDE ANYDOCUMENTATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MISSING. OR NOT TURN THE IN TO PROVIDE PROOF THAT THEY MEET OUR EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS AS WELL AND. HOW LONG DOES THAT PROCESS TAKE. I'M AS I'M RIGHT NOW I WE HAVE WE ARE PRO. IN JANUARY SO WE ARE ABOUT A SIXTY DAY- AND THAT IS CURRENT SO WE'RE WE'RE PRESENT CURRENT AS OF TODAY WITH ANYBODY THAT HAS A FINGERPRINT RESULTS BACK- IN SO AGAIN EACH MORNING WE DO PULL REPORT. SOME DAYS WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED FINGERPRINT- RESULTS BACK AND THOSE HUNDRED PEOPLE WILL BE PROCESSING GIVEN LICENSE TODAY. THAT IS A FINGERPRINT REQUIREMENT IS IT SET THE SAME REQUIREMENT EVEN THOUGH. THE NURSES LICENSE LET'S SAY IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND GEORGIA ALSO REQUIRES A FINGERPRINT. FINGER PRINTS THAT THE FINGERPRINT CARD FINGERPRINT LIVE SCANNERS OF THE CULT LIKE SCAN WHATEVER THEY CALL IT BACK THERE- THAT IS RUN THROUGH THE U. S. DOJ AND THAT STATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS THE SAME. FINGERPRINT RECORDED JAN OF A NURSE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. IT IS- AND THAT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR WHAT'S CALLED RAP BACK AND WHAT OCCURS WITH THAT IS ONCE YOU ESTABLISH FINGERPRINTS WITH THE DOJ HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS NOT A ONE TIME SNAPSHOT IT DOES NOT JUST SAY HEY YOU'RE CLEAR TODAY IT ENSURES THAT ANY POSSIBLE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT IS- TENSELY DIçN. BY THAT LICENSE FEE THAT WE'VE THAT WE ARE AND WILL RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY THEREFORE AND THE IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC PROTECTION IF ANY GREGIS ACTIVITY DID OCCUR WE CAN SUSPEND THAT LICENSE AS EARLY AS THE NEXT DAY. IF THE IF THE FINGER BROTHER WANT TO BELABOR THIS BUT LET ME BELABORED FOR SECOND IF THE FINGERPRINTS ARE DIGITIZED IN GEORGIA. CAN'T THOSE DIGIT THE FINGERPRINTS DON'T CHANGE AT LEAST I GUESS UNLESS YOU SEND THEM OFF. IF HE CAN'T CALIFORNIA ACCESS THE DIGITIZED PRINCE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA TO EXPEDITE THIS pIS A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- ISSUE AND THEIR REGULATION IS THAT IT IS THE CALIFORNIA AND IT WILL GO TO ONE AGENCY- SO AS AN EXAMPLE I HAVE A LIVE SCAN AS AN R&amp;D WHERE- MY RECORDS WILL GO TO THE B. R. N. AS A LICENSEE I ACTUALLY HAD TO LIVE STAND AGAIN AS AN EMPLOYEE. BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD GO TO THE B. R. A. AS IN AGENCIES SO- I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT REALMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS AN R&amp;D AND I HAVE TO GET LICENSE EACH INDIVIDUAL TIME BECAUSE IT DOES GO TO ONE PERSON AND THAT IS- A DOJ PROCESS I SEE SO IT'S A STATE. CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL ISSUE. YES AT THE STATE AGENCY YOUR CREDIT THAT FINGERPRINT PROCESS WITH GOING TO ONE AGENCY AND MEETING NEW FINGERPRINTS TO COMING TO CALIFORNIA THAT IS A PROCESS WE DO HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT IS OUTLINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE YOU SAY BUT THERE'S U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ITS THE CALIFORNIA LAWYER. THANK YOU OKAY COLLEAGUES I'M FINISHED I APOLOGIZED- DOCTOR PAN. I THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT ISSUES NOW NOT ALL OF THEM ARE NECESSARILY NEW PRODUCT THAT'S A PROBLEM SOME. SO THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF GROUND ON THAT CONTRACT COVER ALL THIRTY EIGHT- BUT THERE ARE THREE MAJOR AREAS I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON- FIRST OF ALL. ON ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BILLING RATE- I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT- THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EACH BOARD IS A COMES THROUGH I DO WANNA MAKE NOTE THAT WITH THE INCREASE IN. HOURLY FEES- AND AGAIN THIS IS A BACK OF THE NAPKIN TYPE CALCULATION BUT FOR AN ATTORNEY THAT WOULD REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY- FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AN ANNUAL K. PREPARE LEGAL FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND ANNUAL PAY AND FOR AN ANALYST FOUR HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND AND HEN YOU'LL PAY ALL RIGHT- YET I ALSO KNOW BECAUSE I'M SO USED TO CHAIR PERS- I KNOW HOW TO LOOK UP THESE- ACTUAL THE ACTUAL PAY SO REFERRED TO DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL- LEVEL THREE- AT THE TOP OF THE SCALE IS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND- THE TOP OF THE PEACEFUL FOR LONG DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL LEVEL FIVE WHICH IS THE TOP END IS A A YEAR. AND A SUPERVISING DEPUTY AG IS ACTUALLY A THAT MEANS WE HAVE AN OVERHEAD RATE OF OVER A 100% PROBABLY LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY OR A 130% AND THEN WE THINK ABOUT ANALYSTS WHICH I SAID WAS TO TYPE IN FOR A SENIOR LEGISLATIVE LEGAL ANALYST IS ONLY 810-002-0050 TWO SO THEREFORE DEBTS AND OVER THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. OVERHEAD RATE. SO SO REALIZE THE FOR THE BOARD OF NURSING I GUESS THE QUESTION HERE IS THAT- GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU ARE COLLECTING FEES FROM NURSES- HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH THE COST PRESSURES RELATED TO. THESE TYPES OF FEES WITH SUCH HIGH OVERHEAD RATES. CURRENTLY WEEK WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE THAT IS EXPECTED WE DO HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE WHERE WE TREAT. ALL OF THE CASES THAT COME IN AND SEE IF THEY EVEN NEED TO BE ELEVATED TO THE EIGHTY LEVEL SO WE MAY- RIGHT AND FINE WE MAY EVALUATE INTERNALLY WITH AND- SPEAK WITH THE DC DAYS. DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATIONS DIVISIONS OF INVESTIGATIONS SORRY ABOUT THAT- AND THEN ONLY CASES THAT HAVE TO GO TO AG GO TODAY. IN AN INCREASE IN OUR FOR YOUR DEGREE THE NUMBER REFERRALS TO DOJ STAFF THAN TO TRY TO LIMIT COST. AS LONG AS THE. WHAT IT HOLD THE CASE BACK IF IT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE CARE BRIDGET THAT DO YOU DO SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE I MEAN GIVEN YOU LOOKED AT YOUR WORKLOAD WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT TO YOUR BOARDS WHICH FAMILIES FINANCIALLY DOING BETTER AND MANY OTHER BOARDS BUT STILL. IT'S AN IMPACT- WILL HAVE YOU DONE AN ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE- FINANCIAL IMPACT WOULD BE. SQUARE IT WE DO GET- MONTHLY STATEMENTS FROM OUR AG'S OFFICE- OKAY SO. AS A YEAR AGO WE DID RECEIVE THAT AND WE CANNOT DO OUR PLEADINGS. AND THAT WAS DUE TO AN INTERPRETATION OF A LAW- AND WHEN THAT LAW WAS APPROPRIATELY INTERPRETED- THAT DIEGO DID DECIDE THAT. THEY NEED TO SERVE THE PLEADINGS AND THAT DID CAUSE A- COSTINCREASE FOR US AS WELL. OKAY SO I WOULD HOPE AND AGAIN- I'M REALIZING BRING UP HERE BUT I MEAN WITH EVERY BOARD DAY WE SHOULD SHOULD DOING SOME SORT PROJECTION LOOKING AT YOUR WORKLOAD SAYING WELL. WE GENERALLY NEED TO USE AG STAFFER THAT'S- WHAT EXACTLY. IS GOING TO BE TO INCREASE COSTS- ANDI DO THINK THAT. THIS BY MORE FOR US THAN FOR USE THAT- WE REALLY DO NEED TO DELVE INTO IT I THINK THOSE OVERHEAD RATES ARE EXTREMELY. EXCESSIVE AND- I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT SHOULD BE BORNE BY LICENSEES- AS WELL SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC- SO I ALWAYS. I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED IN CONTINUING EDUCATION- HAVING SERVED ON AND- THIS- COMMITTEE FOR A WHILE. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS COME UP WITH THE REST OF BOARD REGISTERED NURSING OTHER PRIOR TO YOUR UP. BEING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS- REGARDING TEACHING EDUCATION- COUPLE LEVELS OF ONE IS THAT YEAH I NOTICED IN THE WRITE UP WHICH UNFORTUNATELY. ALL TOO BRIEF ON CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT- YOUR THAT OF COURSE THE BOARD ACTUALLY- REVIEWS AND APPROVES CONTINUING EDUCATION SO- THERE'S BEEN IN THE PAST SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT SOME SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE COURSES THAT WERE APPROVED FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY SCIENCE BASED A PRACTICE BASED. AND SO HOW'S THAT BEING DEALT WITH AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE. RELATED TO HOLD CONTINUING EDUCATION IS. DO YOU HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY TO ENSURE THAT- COURSES THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT ARE ACTUALLY CONTINUING EDUCATION AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THEY WISH TO SELL NURSES. AND IT ASIDE FROM THAT. THE ROLE OF THE BOARD AND APPROVING. MEDINA DOES ALSO NOTE. THAT PROVIDE. WHICH OTHER BOARDS. ON YOU- ASSESS THAT WE THAT YOUR MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS SO THERE'S A CLIMATE OF THIRTY CREDITS EVERY. TWO YEARS- THE HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LICENSEES ARE. MADE TO MIDDLE TOWARDS DO IT OUT RENEWAL DO YOU ACTUALLY- DO AT SOME OF ALKYLATION OF- ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY FULFILLING THIS REQUIREMENT OF DOING THIRTY CREDITS- EVERY. EVERY TWO YEARS ARE NOT SO WHAT PERCENTAGE YOUR- SO DO YOU HAVE SOME DATA YOU CAN SHARE WITH US AS TO. HOW COMPLIANT LICENSEES ARE WITH THE C. REQUIREMENTS SO I DO REALIZE OF SEVERAL QUESTIONS EMBEDDED IN THERE BUT- THOSE. ARE SOME QUESTIONS RELATED CONTINUING EDUCATION. THERE IS THANK YOU CENTER PAM- WITH OUR CONTINUING EDUCATION PROCESS IT IS- MULTI FACETED SO I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT AND BE AS SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE. WE DO STRIVE TO AUDIT ABOUT 10% OF OUR LICENSEES- IT IS A RANDOMIZED AUDIT. AND WITH THEM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES IT'S A VERY LARGE NUMBER SO WE DO. HAVE THAT AS ARTICLE. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO IS ON OUR RENEWAL PROCESS WHEN THEY ACCESS THE BREEZE SYSTEM. EACH OUR END HAS TO. MAKE AN ATTESTATION THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT COMPLETED THE THIRTY C. E. USE IN THAT LAST TWO YEAR TIME FRAME- WITH OUR ENDS BEING VOTED AS MOST ETHICAL PROFESSIONAL LAST TWENTY YEARS I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN BELIEVE THAT. I MEAN I THINK I. DO A TEST THAT STATION SO BUT YOU SAID YES ACTUALLY AUDIT DO YOU ACTUALLY AUDIT 10% THEN. OUR GOAL IS ABOUT. 10% OF ALL ISRAEL. IT I THINK WE'VE DONE ABOUT 8% I THINK STILL WRAPPING THAT I. BUT WE HAVE MADE OUR GOAL OF TEN PER YET BUT I THINK READ EIGHT. ADDITIONALLY EACH ONE OF OUR- LICENSEES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SUBMIT THAT- ON THAT REFORM THEY SUBMIT THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM THAT THEY RECEIVE THE CONTINUING EDUCATION UNITS THROUGH. HOW MANY HOURLY UNITS ARE- PART IN THAT ADDITION TO THE C. E. P. PROVIDER NUMBER THAT IS INPUT IT AND THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO DIRECTLY UPLOAD A COPY OF THE CERTIFICATE THAT THEY HAVE COMPLAINTS. THAT SHOWS THAT THEY COMPLETED INTO OUR PRE SYSTEM FOR REVIEW- RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS NOT IN STOCK. SO THEY CAN'T GO PAST THAT- AREA WITHOUT SUBMITTING THAT CERTIFICATE. BUT WE DO WE ARE LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGICALLY. ADVANCES TO REQUIRE THAT A STOPPER PROVED HAS TO BE SUBMITTED AT THAT TIME. OKAY. AND THEN APPROVAL OF C. COURSES. APPROVED OF SECOURS RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE REGULATION THAT STATES THAT- IT HAS VERY IS SET OF REQUIREMENTS ONE BEING THAT IT HASTO BE AT OR ABOVE THE LEVEL. OF THE EDUCATION THAT IS PROVIDING FOR- PRIOR TO LICENSING- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THAT RIGHT NOW HE IS- THERE ARE MANY AREAS IMPROVING WITH THAT WE- APPROVED ONE SAMPLE COURSE. FOR THAT CD PROVIDER AND BASED ON THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO- HAVE A CONTINUING EDUCATION PROVIDER NUMBER WE HAVE WORKED TO UPDATE OUR REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE IT MORE. GUIDELINES TO THAT AND THAT IS INTHE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH APPROVAL AS FOR ATTENDEES IS THERE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY. THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY AS OF NOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED INTO THIS REGULATORY DATE UNLESS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ADDED IN THE STATUTE OKAY SO I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THE ISSUE THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY THREE REAL- IF WE CAN. HAVE MORE INFORMATION I'D APPRECIATE THAT- THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS I THINK A- VERY BRIEF AND NOT PARTICULARLY ILLUMINATING. IT DIDN'T WANT JUST A ONE LAST QUESTION ABOUT C. E. YOU OF COURSE THE LICENSE MADE DIFFERENT TYPES AND HEARSES- NURSE PRACTITIONERS AS WELL A DAY ONLY DO THEY ONLY HAVE TO DO THIRTY CREDITS BECAUSE PHYSICIANS HAVE TO BE FIFTY CREDITS OF. EVERY TWO YEARS SO- DISPATCHERS- HAVING TO DO AT LEAST FIFTY LIKE PHYSICIANS DEALER. THERE'S ONLY A THIRTY. FOR THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING CURRENT. ALL OF OUR ADVANCED PRACTICE OUR HANDS INCLUDING YOURS PRACTITIONERS ARE LICENSED AS IRAN'S AND THEREFORE HAVE B. R. AND C. E. REQUIREMENT WHICH IS THIRTY EVERY TWO. YEARS NOW THEIR NATIONAL CERTIFICATION THAT IS FOR THEIR NURSE PRACTITIONER- CERTIFICATION THEY MAY REQUIRE SOMETHING DIFFERENT OKAY BUT FOR LICENSURE THE ONLY THIRTY OKAY AT THAT PERHAPS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ADDRESS AND- IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN FINALLY- THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT- I UNDERSTAND YOU BECAME LAW- THE WELL YOU ARE ACTING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- STARTING IN SEPARATE TWENTY TWENTY BUT SEE JUST HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE FORD REGISTERED NURSING ON STAFF. YEAH I WAS IN NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT PRIOR TO DOING THE VOLUNTEER POSITION OF ACTING EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND I STARTED HERE WITH THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING- I BELIEVE TWENTY FOURTEEN MAYOR TWENTY. MAY TWENTY FOURTH EVEN WITH- YOU'VE BEEN ON STAFF OF THE BILL REGISTERED NURSING SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN OKAY THANK YOU YES- SO. SO THEREFORE YOU ARE ACTUALLY ON THE STAFF ALTHOUGH IN A DIFFERENT ROLE WHEN THE AUDIT CAME OUT- DATA SHOWED THAT UNFORTUNATELY AT LEAST THREE. US MEMBERS OF THE STAFF- SHE WOULD SAY COMMITTED FRAUD- AND LYFT YELLED- IN DETROIT AND SEE THE STATE AUDITOR NOW YOUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- AND- YOU HEARD OF SOME QUESTIONS PRIOR FROM- MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT CULTURE AND BECAUSE AFTER ALL THIS IS JUST ONE PERSON. WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING THEY WERE DOING IT THREE I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S I MEAN THERE'S A CODE THAT THERE'S COLLUSION THERE- WHAT ARE YOU WOW. I MEAN HAVING BEEN ON THE BOARD ACTUALLY ON THE STAFF AT THE TIME AGAIN- WHEN THIS WAS HAPPENING. ONE WHAT DO YOU THINK LED TO THAT AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING ITS EXACT DIRECTOR TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM- THE THIS CULTURAL- THAT APPARENTLY ALLOW THE THREE THREE MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AT LEAST- TO ENGAGE IN THIS AND THAT. KIND OF. BEHAVIOR HE AT YEAH THAT WAS A SO TO ME THAT WAS NOT THE CULT THAT I WAS AWAY OF. A AND YOU KNOW I'D AGAIN BUT IT'S UNFORTUNATE IS THAT WAS THE CULTURE RIGHT I MEAN IT MAY BE A SHOCK TO YOU BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS THE CULTURE BECAUSE THREE PEOPLE FELT IT WAS OKAY TO DO THAT. SO SO HOPEFULLY IN RETROSPECT AS MUCH AS WE DON'T WANT TO THINK THAT WAS THE CULTURE IT WAS. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CHANGE IT. YEAH WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS TO CHANGE IT IT'S STUDENTS RECEIVE THAT REPORT WHICH AS I SAID WAS A DEFINITELY A SHOCK TO ME- I REACHED OUT TO DCA I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MY- ABILITIES WERE TO ADDRESS THIS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. I WAS SIMPLY I WAS IN MY ACTING ROLE- AND HAD NOT BECOME THE OFFICIAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THAT POINT- AND SO I DID I SOUGHT GUIDANCE- WHEN I GOT THAT REPORT I MET WITH THAT D. C. A. AND I RECEIVED AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF SUPPORT AND EVEN MET WITH AGENCY AS WELL WHO SUPPORTED ME IN THIS PROCESS- WE LAUNCHED- AN INVESTIGATION INTERNAL MASTICATION WITH DCA- AND THE REQUEST THAT I ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO. WHICH I WAS GRANTED WAS A COMPLETE REVIEW OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE TURNED OVER TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MY THOUGHT IS IF THIS HAPPENED TO ONE IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. WITH OTHER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS WAS A ONE TIME ONLY AND ONLY DONE FOR THAT ONE AREA OF RECOMMENDATION- AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. THE OTHER THING THAT I THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GUYS ARE WHERE IT IS WE HAVE A BRAND NEW EXECUTIVE TEAM- THEY'VE ALL BEEN HIRED AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR TO YEAR AND A HALF- AND THAT CHANGES THE CULTURE AUTOMATICALLY THERE SO WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO CONTINUE WITH THAT CULTURE CHANGE AND BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. I AM SURE THAT YOU NOTICED IN OUR- SENSOR REPORT THE RETURN THE AND WHERE WE ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE MANY ITEMS THAT WE HAD NOT MET- OVER THE YEARS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT- OTHER THAN. THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS I'M WILLING TO TAKE THEM AND KEEP THEM AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE ALSO CERTAINLY CHANGING SOME OF THE EXECUTIVES- CAN. HELP BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE COMMUNICATING TO THE STAFF. AND- AND A WE HAVE BEEN. TIME HERE I WHAT I WOULD JUST WE DID TRAINING AS WELL DIDN'T WITH- WHERE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGEMENT TEAM DID. RECEIVE THAT TRAINING ONLINE- IO OTHER OTHER AREAS AND HE DID INFORM THE COURT THAT THAT TRAINING WAS COMPLETED. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT I DID THAT I GUESS WHAT. I'M LOOKING CERTAIN ABOUT I DON'T SEE HERE IS IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT WAS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM SO YES WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW THINGS WE CHANGED OVER SOME STAFF BUT- SOME REFLECTION ON WHAT WHAT LED TO THAT WHY WAS IT OKAY WHY DO THOSE PEOPLE THINK I MEAN. I WAS OKAY AND I THINK WE WHAT A- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN THAT BEHAVIOR- THERE NEED BE CONSEQUENCES FOR BUT ALSO WE NEED TO GO BEYOND LIKE ALL THE SHAME AND BLAME CULTURE LIKE THOSE THOSE PEOPLE IT WAS AN S. RIGHT SO SOMEHOW IT WAS THE FOR THEM BILLS OKAY. WHY WAS THAT AND WHAT CULTURAL TO IT'S LARGER CULTURAL THING AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CHANGE OVER I GUESS I'LL JUST CONCLUDE- MY OVERALL COMMENTS BY SAYING IS THAT I APPRECIATE THERE'S A NEW TEAM THERE'S THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE AND- ETCETERA- YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS ARE CHANGING- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.I WOULD JUST URGE AND I HOPE YOU WOULD BE SUPPORT OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S NO I DON'T THINK WE COULD GO THROUGH EVERYTHING THE SESSION OR EVEN THIS YEAR. THAT I FEEL THAT THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES ARE STILL OUTSTANDING THAT WE SHOULD DO IT OVERSIGHT-REVIEW OF THIS EXTEND THE BOARD FOR ONLY A YEAR. LET'S GO SEE WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE I KNOW YOU JUST BEEN IN THIS POSITION FOR ESSENTIALLY A YEAR SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION YOU CAN ALSO AS YOU'VE BEEN YOU KNOW IN YOUR NEW ROLE WITH YOUR NEW TEAM. FEEDBACK MORE INFORMATION TO US ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE WHAT WE GAIN SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON HOW YOU'RE GOING THE PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING THAT YOU ITS TOP YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF THIS YOUR DRESSING THE AUDITS AND SO FORTH. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR I GIVE ME THE TIME- CHAIRS- TO- TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU DR PAN KILLINGS ON THE FLOOR. OF SURE LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RICHARD ROTH MISMO YOU- WALK. THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR. US HERE. TODAY A FIRST OF ALL. WHO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE ARE IN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WITH. THAT OF OUR ENDS AND NURSES. AND THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THEY DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CALL THE PANDEMIC SO- APPLAUDS- YOU. AND ALL OF THE- LICENSEES FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK IN. HELPING TO SUPPORT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THIS TIME OF NEED. RIGHT WE NEED TO SEE DAILY THAT LIVES ARE BEING LOST. AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP UP LIFT. THAT OF THOSE. WHO ARE. DOING THEIR JOBS AS FRONTLINE RESPONDERS AND- HELPING TO SAVE LIVES IS IMPORTANT FOR US. COLLECTIVELY SO AGAIN COME COMMENDING YOU. FOR THE WORK AND- A PLEASE KEEP A SURPRISED AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP SUPPORT. THOSE WHO HELP SUPPORT US. THAT THE NEWSOME MEL B. AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARING AND I SAID SAID EARLIER THAT WE ARE SIMPLY DOING OUR JOB OR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IN OUR JOB I MUST MEET YOU REITERATE- THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE SPECIFICALLY THAT A LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEE PUBLIC MEMBERS I WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE. TODAY'S IN TODAY'S TESTIMONY FOR TESTIMONY TODAY'S HEARING- SIMILARLY GOVERNMENT CODE DOES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTIMONY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE BY GRANTING COMMITTEES BROAD SUBPOENA POWER TO COMPEL WITNESSES TO PARTICIPATE IF THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATION WILL BE MINDFUL OF OUR AUTHORITY- SO DO YOU COMMIT TO HELPING TO ENSURE THAT YOU AND YOUR BOARD WILL PARTICIPATE IN THIS FULLY PUBLIC PROCESS. I DO COMMIT TO THAT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. ALSO IT WAS REFERENCE EARLIER ABOUT YOUR NEW ROLE- IN IN THIS CAPACITY TO AND- THEIR NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BUT JUST SOME GENERAL COMMENTS IS AT. WITH RESPECT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CHALLENGING TIMES ESPECIALLY FOR OUR ENDS AND HOW WE CAN HELP UPLIFT AND EMPOWER. PUBLIC COLLEGES I AM A PRODUCT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES MYSELF AS WELL AS SEE ISSUES I THINK THE PROVIDE A KEY ROLE IN TERMS OF THE PIPELINE AND DEVELOPMENT- I. PERSONALLY TAKE THE POSITION OF TRYING TO GO AGAINST THE CORPORATE IS A NATION OF THE INDUSTRY AND HELPING TO FURTHER THE PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT OF COURSE PRIVATE. COLLEGES PLAY A KEY ROLE AS WELL BUT I THINK IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS A PUBLIC ENTITY A TO HELP SUPPORT WHERE POSSIBLE TO. US ALL ALONG THOSE LINES- WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THOSE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS- HOW. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON HOW WE CAN HELP EMPOWER OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN OUR PUBLIC ENTITIES. SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY PIPELINE- ANDERSON PIPELINE. I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I SHARE SOME AMAZING STATISTICS AT THE END OF THE START OFF WITH- FROM. FEBRUARY OR SORRY MARCH. NINETEENTH OF FEBRUARY TWENTY RIGHT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STARTED- THERE WERE. HE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I GOT MY NUMBERS RIGHT TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT LICENSOR BY EXAMS FOR INITIAL CALIFORNIA OUR ENDS. AND THEN EVEN WITH THAT PANDEMIC AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DID FACE TOGETHER WITH THAT FROM MARCH SECOND TO FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE LICENSE WE HAVE RECEIVED LICENSE BY EXAM FOR THE FIRST TIME LICENSE OR FOR IN STATE CALIFORNIA'S- CALIFORNIA GRADS. TWELVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN SO WE HAVE EXCEEDED WHAT WAS DONE THE PRIOR YEAR. ACTUALLY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SO- THROUGH THE HARD WORK OF MY NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANTS. THE DEDICATION OF THE STUDENTS AND- THAT TIRELESSLY HOURS THAT ARE DECENT DIRECTORS PUT IN OUR NURSING STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO PROGRESSIVE GRADUATE ALTHOUGH THEY HAD MANY MANY HURDLES TO OVERCOME SO I WANT TO- HELP TO ASSURE YOU THAT OUR PIPELINE CURRENTLY IS STILL SECURE. AND THAT WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT STAYS- SECURE. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION ON THE- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP AMERICAN COMMUNITY BASED SCHOOLS IS REALLY COMES DOWN TO FUNDING HONESTLY- AS IN MY PRIOR ROLE I WENT OUT TO THE SCHOOLS I DID THOSE- REVIEWS ON EVERY TEAM BASIC AND WHAT I FOUND A LOT OF TIMES THEY'RE OPERATING OFF THE GRANT FUNDS- AND THAT SOME OF THEIR FACULTY POSITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED- AND- THAT. AND THEY'RE MISSING SOME KEY PLAYERS ON THEIR TEAM THAT SOME OF OUR PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE- SOME OF THEM BEING CONTINUE UP KIDS AND CLINICAL PLACEMENT COORDINATORS- WHERE THAT PERSON'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE. THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THAT THEIR COMPETITIVE IN THE REGION- THAT THEY GET THE PAPERWORK IN THE VARIOUS DOCUMENTS TURNED INTO DAM- SO THAT THE STUDENTS CAN- CAN ADD TEN THOSE CLINICAL SITE. AND A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THAT AND IF THEY DO HAVE THE FUNDING IS DONE THROUGH GRANT FUNDS- SO REALLY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT. COMES TO- GETTING BACK THE- ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AS WELL AS FACULTY SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE. GREAT THE ECONOMICALLY PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THAT AND I QUESTION THE DESIRE CERTAINLY TO HELP EMPOWER THAT OF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND- JUST BREAKS MY HEART SEEING THAT. SYSTEM BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE COST HIGH CUTS OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS THOUSAND TO GRADUATE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN TIME WHEN WHICH WE NEED. THE PIPELINE FOR THE FUTURE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO KEEP MINDFUL OF TO. WITH RESPECT TO SCHOOLS- IF AT A FUTURE MEETING SCHOOLS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXCEPTIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING HIGH NCLEX PASS RATES AND CAN ALSO APPROVED CLINICAL SITE AVAILABILITY. BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS BE APPROVED. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY BOARD BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE RECOMMENDATION THAT COMES FROM OR ANY SEASON- THE THROUGH THE AGENDA ITEM SUMMARY AFTER THEY DO THEIR RUBIO- IT IS IT'S KEY IN THAT PROCESS. THE SCHOOL IS ASSIGNED A NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANT THAT THEY WORK ONE ON ONE WITH WHEN IS SCHOOL HAS B- THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WANT TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT OR OPEN A NEW CAMPUS OR OFFER AD AND IT DID TIONAL DEGREE GRANTING OPTION. THEY APPROACH THEIR NURSING EDUCATION ASSAULTED AND THEY PROVIDE- INFORMATION ON HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT THAT ADDITIONAL- AMOUNT OF STUDENTS TEACHER RESOURCES THEY ENSURE FACULTY BE ASSURE THE BUDGET THE ENSURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE THE CLINICAL SITES THAT SUPPORT THAT. ONCE THAT IS DONE IN OUR NURSING EDUCATION SULTANS DO WITH THOROUGH REVIEW OF THAT INFORMATION. COMPARE THAT TO THE DATA THAT IS- THERE IN THE REGION WHERE THEY LOOK AT IS THEIR WORK NEEDS ARE THERE- CLINICAL STATEMENTS HAVE THE HAS A SCHOOL THEMSELF ENABLE TO SECURITY ADDITIONAL CLINICAL SITE SITE. AND THEN THEY DO THEY HAVE THE FACULTY THAT CAN SUPPORT BECAUSE AS STUDENTS GO TO CLINICAL SITES THEY ALSO NEED FACULTY THAT WILL OVERSEE THEM. IF AT THAT POINT IT IS- ASCERTAINED BY THE NURSING EDUCATION CONSULTANTS THAT THEY HAVE MET THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PASSED YOU ARE BOARD MEMBERS IN THE EDUCATION LICENSING COMMITTEE MEETING AND THEN THE EDUCATION LICENSE YOU CAN REALLY MEETING MAKES THE RECOMMENDATION THAT GOES FORWARD TO THE FULL BOARD- THE FOLLOWING MONTH AND THAT FULL BOARD WILL BE NEAT. THEY DISCUSS AND ASK QUESTIONS THE DEAN AND RECTOR OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION IS ON THE LINE AND AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND THE BOARD MEMBERS TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT TUITION ABOUT WHAT THE SIZE OF THAT ENROLLMENT CREASE IS. AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT FOR THAT AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE CAUSING ANY CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT. IF THAT IS- ABLE TO BE ASSURED THEN ENROLLMENT INCREASES NEAR CAMPUS IS- NEW PROGRAMS ANYTHING THERE IS COMPLETED- I DO HAVE SOME TO STATISTICS ON THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN I'M ON THE ENROLLMENT INCREASES THAT WE'VE DONE EVEN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC IF THAT- IS INTERESTING. IF NOT WE CAN PUT THAT IN OUR REPORT. IF THAT BE THE BE HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR THANK YOU CHAIR LOW ANY OTHER CAR IN THE CHAMBER MEMBER DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE- SO QUESTIONS SOME QUESTIONS IN REGARDS SEAT LICENSURE VERIFICATION- ON MAY TWENTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY I PRESENTED AB THIRTY SIXTEEN BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE THIS BILL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AND TO IMPLEMENT AN ELECTRONIC LICENSE VERIFICATION. SYSTEM KNOWN AS NURSES DOT COM THAT IS USED BY FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES FOR IMMEDIATE ONLINE LICENSE FOR VERIFICATION AND OFFERS ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES. AT THAT HEARING THE BEER AND TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION AGREEING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH BACKLOG FOR LICENSURE VERIFICATION AND PROMISING TO IMPLEMENT AN ONLINE PAYMENT OPTION IN ELECTRONIC VERIFICATION PROCESS THROUGH THE BREEZE SYSTEM BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. MY QUESTIONS. THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT BACKLOG FOR LICENSURE VERIFICATION. THANK YOU I'M TRYING TO ACCESS THAT DATA REALLY QUICK I DID GET AN UPDATE FROM MY DEPUTY CHIEF OF LICENSING THIS MORNING AS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I HAD THE MOST ACCURATE. DATA FOR YOU RIGHT NOW FOR IN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR AGAIN VERIFICATIONS ARE WHEN A NURSE THAT IS LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA IS TRYING TO GO TO OUT OF STATE. AND THEN WE HAVE ENDORSEMENTS FOR NURSES OUT OF STATE TRYING TO GET IN CALIFORNIA SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE I GIVE YOU- THAT CORRECT INFORMATION CAN YOU SPECIFY TO ME YES ONE YES THAT'S- WORTH YES THAT'S A QUESTION AND- YOU CAN. RIGHT RIGHT NOW ASK ANSWER THIS- HAS A B. R. AND IMPLEMENTED. THE ON ELECTRONIC PAYMENT PROCESS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING IT AND I DID GET A REPORT OUT YESTERDAY THAT THE HOPE IS FOR IT TO GO ONLINE. AS EARLY AS NEXT MONTH. IS THAT TRUE BREEZE THAT WILL BE THROUGH BREEZE YES I DO HAVE AN I. T. TEAM THAT I NEED WITH THE DAILY- IT JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS AND- AND THEY ARE DOING SMALL IMPLEMENTATIONS AND VARIOUS THINGS- AS RAPID AS POSSIBLE AS WE DO SEE THAT WE HAVE A NEED FOR THIS SIZE IT LOOKS LIKE THE VERIFICATIONS WILL GO ONLINE. MARCH FIRST. AS THE COMING THERE THEY WENT ONLINE I'M SORRY OKAY IS IT ME JUST CHECK THIS DATA REALLY QUICK. OKAY WE ARE PROCESSING VERIFICATIONS AS OF MARCH FIRST SO I JUST GOT MY WIRES CROSSED THERE FOR A SECOND AND IT DOES CONTINUE TO HAVE THE GOAL. FOR IT TO GO LIVE FOR AN ONLINE PROCESS AS SOON AS NEXT. SO YOUR WEBSITE. RIGHT NOW SAYS A TARGET TIME FRAME FOR PROCESSING A REQUEST FOR ONLINE LICENSE VERIFICATION THROUGH BREEZE IS FOUR TO SIX WEEKS THIS SEEMS. IF IT'S AN ONLINE PROCESS THAT SEEMS TO BE A VERY LONG TIME TO FOR ME- AND ALSO WHY IS THE TIMELINE SO LONG IF THE NURSES SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION. ME AGAIN FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES USE THIS PROCESS. YEAH I COULD SPEAK TO THAT- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE BREEZE WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND BASS LICENSE PROP FORWARD FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE WITHIN THE PRE SYSTEM AND THEY ARE ELECTRONIC AND THOSE ARE LIKE WE SAID CURRENT AS OF MARCH FIRST SO THAT'S JUST ELEVEN DAYS- FROM RIGHT NOW AND SO WE ARE PROCESSING THEM. FAST WITH THE LICENSEES THAT- CAME INTO THE BOARD PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BREEZE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THOSE LICENSEES THE BEST DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ON THEM ARE NOT STORED WITHIN BREEZE. AS WE GET IN EQUITY WE ADD THAT INTO BREEZE AND WE DO HAVE STAFF ASSIGNED TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE UPDATE ALL THAT INFORMATION IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR- AS WE SAID- IN SOME OF THAT. COMMUNICATION HERE IS THAT WE HAVE OVER FIVE WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND LICENSEES IS THE RICH WERE DOING- WHAT WE- OUR INTENT IS TO GET ALL OF THEM IN DEGREES. EVEN IF WE WENT SEE YOU THE NURSES SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE A DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION AS WE DO HAVE TO DIGITALIZE. THOSE DOCUMENTS AND ALLOW FOR THEM TO BE TRANSFERRED EVEN INTO THAT THE NURSE THE SYSTEM THE NURSES SYSTEM COMMUNICATES TO OUR BREEZE- WE DO YOU CURRENTLY USE NURSES SYSTEMS FOR. DISCIPLINE AND OTHER STATES AND- MARTIN FORSMAN SYSTEM. SO WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY FOR TO COMMUNICATE BUT IT CAN ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS THE THREE SYSTEM. PRIOR TO ME COMING ON AS EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN JUNE LAST YEAR- WE HAD DOCUMENTS- ON LICENSEES BUILT ON MICROFILM. AS WELL AS MICROFICHE AND SO- WE DID GO AHEAD AND GET A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS TRANSCRIBED THE MICROFILM ONTO A DIGITAL AND SEARCH FOR DOCUMENTS. AND DCA IS WORKING THROUGH THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO WRITE BACK TO US SO THAT WE CAN SEARCH THAT INFORMATION. AND WE'LL BE ABLE SAID THEN. INPUT THAT INTO GREASE- IT'S OUR HOPE BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE MEETING SOME ROADBLOCKS IN AS THOSE SYSTEMS ARE NOT COMMUNICATING. SO WHAT WOULD BE THE TIMELINE TO EXPECT THE IN THIS IS A B. R. AND- FOR PROMISE. THE FIVE DAY PROCESSING TIME. WITH THE ONE EVERYTHING- SETS WERE ALREADY AN AT PROCESSING I THINK WE CAN. MOVE F. R. FORWARD QUICKLY- WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR LICENSE PROCESS SEES AND WE ACTUALLY JOINED TO DCA AND THE VERY FIRST IT'S CALLED THE ENLIGHTENED LICENSING PROJECT- AND WE VOLUNTEERED FOR THAT. AND WE'RE RECEIVING A LOT OF HELP FROM ALL THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS COMING TOGETHER AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP US ENHANCE THIS PROCESS AS WE ARE ABOUT THE LARGEST BOARD. WITH THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF LICENSEES. IN THAT PATTERN THAT'S GREAT NEWS DID YOU FIND OUT THE CURRENT BACKLOG. AMOUNT FOR VERIFICATION OUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO HAVE THAT THEY GAVE ME INTEREST ME AND I DID SEND AN EMAIL OUT- AND IT JUST CAME AND WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THAT ARE PENDING RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBER DOLLARS JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YOU KNOW. IN PAGE THIRTY EIGHT OF THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WAS PREPARED FOR THIS HEARING- ON THIS PARTICULAR NURSES ISSUE. THERE'S A STATEMENT THE BEER IN PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED UTILIZING NURSES FOR OUT OF STATE ENDORSEMENTS STATING THAT IT WOULD LOSE AND THIS IS A QUOTE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. WOULD BE LOST FROM CONTRACTING THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE TO A PRIVATE ENTITY THIS REVENUE SUPPORTS OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE B. R. AND SUCH IS ENFORCEMENT AND DISCIPLINE WHICH MAINTAINS. PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S THE END OF THE QUOTE THAT THAT WOULD SORT OF SUGGESTS TO ME AT LEAST AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THAT WE ELECTED TO USE A SLOWER PROCESS IN ORDER TO GENERATE FEES FROM LICENSEES TO RAISE REVENUE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. I ASSUME THAT- TO THE IT TO THE EXTENT THAT STATEMENT IS ACCURATEI ASSUME THAT PREDATES YOU MA'AM. MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT PREDATES ME AS WELL- AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THE PROCESS HERE I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ENDORSING BUT YOU SAID ENDORSING OUT. AND SO ENDORSING TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING MEANS. NURSES THAT ARE OUT OF STATE THAT ARE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA AND I BELIEVE THE QUESTION I JUST ANSWERED WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT VERIFICATIONS AND THAT IS WHERE LICENSE. ARE ENDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO GO OUT OF CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COMPARING THAT THAT. CORRECT TERMS WELL LIKE A KITTEN SO I DID NOT PREPARE THE BACKGROUND PAPER I CAN'T. ATTEST TO THAT BUT IT RELATES TO THE ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH CALIFORNIA LICENSE. PORTABILITY IN LICENSED CALIFORNIA REGISTERED NURSES THAT WHICH WHICH TO PRACTICE OUT OF STATE. ENDORSING TO OTHER STATES NURSING BOARD SO I DO THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLES ARE APPLES HERE. AND IF SO I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DON'T FAVOR SLOWER PROCESS SEES IN ORDER TO RAISE REVENUE TO BENEFIT OTHER PARTS OF THE- BOARD'S OPERATION AND I'M- SURE THAT YOU. FEAR THAT WORK I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL. ENSURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. I AND WE'VE ACTUALLY UPDATED ARE BREEZE PUBLIC FACING LICENSE VERIFICATION AND I'M JUST IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. WHERE WE'VE ADDED OUR LOCAL THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND THEN ON REQUEST WE ALSO ADDED WHETHER OR NOT BE OUR ENDS BETTER IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE LICENSE INITIALLY BY EXAM. OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE LICENSED BY ENDORSING IN FROM ANOTHER STATE THOSE WERE SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM OHER STATES- THAT SAID THAT THEY COULD THEN USE OUR BREEZE SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY PUBLIC FACING. THE START THE ENDORSEMENT PROCESS WITH THE VERIFICATION IS WHAT WE CALL IT INTO THEIR STATE WITH OUT- BE. THE NURSE EVEN HAPPEN TO MAKE A REQUEST TO US- CURRENTLY I DID SPEAK WITH FLORIDA AND THEY ARE USING THIS AND- THEY ARE NOT REQUIRING A FEAT- AND THEY ARE NOT REQUIRING THEIR- NURSES THAT ARE TRYING TO BE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER. THEY'RE GETTING THAT INFORMATION OFF OF OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS A DIRECT COPY OF WHAT OUR BREEZE IS IT'S ACTUALLY GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THAT AND THERE'S NO DELAY AND NO FEE AND FORD IS USING THAT. SO I HAVE BEEN- MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL THE STATE BOARDS OF NURSING TYPICALLY ON EVERY OTHER WEEK BASIS WHERE I. OTHER E. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM OTHER BOARDS ARE THERE AND THEY ARE- JUST THROUGH EDUCATION THROUGH GETTING THE WORDS OUT THREE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT DIFFERENT PROCESSES ARE AND WHAT THEY NEED. WE'RE WORKING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM IN THOSE PROCESS SEES SOME STATES STILL REQUIRE AN OFFICIAL EMAIL OTHERS REQUIRE A PAPER DOCUMENT WITH THE SEAL ON IT. AND BASED ON THOSE BOARDS OF NURSING'S REQUIREMENTS WE'RE LOOKINGAT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM- SO THAT OUR NURSES CAN. GO IN AND OUT OF STATE AND DO THAT IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FROM- LET ME TURN THE SIGNAL OTHER MAKES UP IN THE CHAMBER LET ME TURN TO. MY COLLEAGUES REMOTELY CENTER BATES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ROSS THE END OF. I HAVE BAD ALLERGIES THIS MORNING GUYS SO. BEAR WITH ME. ISMAEL BE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE YOU JUMPED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS AND A DIFFICULT TIME AT YOU WITH THE PIER MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE PROBLEM GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE CONCERN OVER THE AUDIT. IN THE END WHAT SEEM TO BE ALMOST A LIBERTY OF- CRIED HERE- THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH THE BOARD. HAVING SERVED ON MANY BOARDS AND HAVING HAD A FEW ROGUE STAFF ON THAT WE HAD TO. BASICALLY FIRE FOR SOME OF THE SIMILAR REASONS WHAT ROLE DOES THE BOARD HAVE AN OVERSEEING IT STAFF TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING CORRECT INFORMATION ON YOUR WHATEVER THEY SET FOR WAS FOR THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN THE STAFF. ON SOME OF THESE. ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH INVOICE AUDITING AND CERTAINLY IN OUR- BUSINESS AND PROFESSION ON SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS THESE BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE HERE THE MORE SEEMS TO BE DETACHED. FROM SOME SORT OF A FLIRTY OVER THE WORK THAT YOU PRODUCE ARE WHAT THEY ASSIGNED TO YOU- COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. I CAN'T SENATE BATES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- OUR BOARD HAS DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF B. SO THEY APPOINT ME AND THEY CAN REMOVE ME AS WELL SO THAT IS WHERE THE BOARD HAS THE SPECIFIC OVERSIGHT I DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET WITH THE EXECUTIVE TEAM- I'VE BEEN. HELD TEN DAYS AGO WE DID HAVE A PRESIDENT AND A VICE PRESIDENT IN PLACE AND I DID MEET WITH THEM WEEKLY- IF NOT MORE AND THEY WERE FULLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON- WE DID HAVE A RECENT TURNOVER OF OUR- BOARD STAFF HE WAS ON HIS GRACE PERIOD- OF. RTC AFTER ALREADY SERVING TWO TERMS- AND WE HAVE A BOARD MEETING SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY. WHERE THE HOPE IS THAT- BOARD PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT WILL BE APPOINTED- SO THAT WILL THAT JUST HAPPENED WE DID A TEN DAY NOTICE- AND SO WE DID A QUICK TURN AROUND TO TRY TO GET THAT TAKEN CARE OF- AS FOR A SPECIFIC PERSONNEL ISSUES. THE BOARD DOES NOT TYPICALLY HAVE ANY ROLE IN PERSONAL ISSUES OTHER THAN MICE MYSELF- WHAT WE DO YOU CAN DO IS- IN CLOSED SESSION- DO AN AGENDA ITEM FOR PERSONNEL ISSUES WHERE CERTAIN ITEMS IF THEY MEET THE CRITERIA OUTLINED IT BASICALLY CAME CAN BE DISCUSSED- AND- BECAUSE THIS WAS A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDIT. RECOMMENDATION WE'RE INVOLVED THIS WILL WHISTLE BLOWER WE DID SHARE THIS IMMEDIATELY OUT WITH OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND WE DID DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITHIN CLOSE SESSION SO THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. I DO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT BACKGROUND PAPER IN PRINT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT- WHAT IS THAT SAID IN- THIS HEARING HERE IS THAT THE BOARD REQUESTED DISMISSAL- AS PART OF THE STATE PROCESS OUR BOARD. AND MYSELF IS AN EEO DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TERMINATE AN EMPLOYEE- WE HAVE TO REQUEST THE DISMISSAL SO BASED ON REQUESTING THAT DISMISSAL THAT EMPLOY ONLY HAS OPTIONS TO- ASK FOR A HEARING WITH THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD AND THEN- LEGAL DECISIONS AND- POTENTIALLY SETTLEMENTS CANNOT CURSE BASED ON THAT STATE PROCESS. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR THAT IN MY COMMUNICATION WITH THE- STATE AUDITOR I DID SAY THAT I REQUESTED DISMISSAL ARE ADVERSE ACTION AND I SAID THE SUPPORTING INFORMATION TO THAT- APAN RECEDING THE BACKGROUND PAPER LAST NIGHT I DID GO ON TO THE WEBSITE. AND THE WEBSITE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR DOES SAY THAT. I REQUEST A DISMISSAL THAT WAS NOT BE A FROM THAT WE SOME TO THE HOW. I MEAN TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S IN A WRITTEN RESPONSE HOWEVER WITH THE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION THAT WAS SUBMITTED THEIR THAT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION DOES STATE THAT ME AS THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN OUR BOARD IN SUPPORT DID REQUEST DISMISSAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I'M- THINKING MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE. IF NOT LEGISLATION SOME DISCUSSION REGARDING THE MEMBERS THEY GET APPOINTED TO THIS BOARD UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR AUTHORITY IS. CERTAINLY WHAT THEIR BACKGROUND YEARS SO THAT THEY KNOW THE QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN THEY'RE FEELING THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE TO THEIR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CERTAINLY THEIR STAFFIS A CRITICAL WAY. TO ENSURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN YEAH. TO ME THERE WAS SOME SORT OF A DISCONNECT THERE WHEN IT WENT ON TO THE LEVELS AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME NINETEEN BECAUSE- AN ATTORNEY AND I. REALLY BROUGHT OUT SOMETHING THAT WE BE- I THINK LOOKED. MORE CAREFULLY AND DEEPLY BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T PUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY BACK IN THE EQUATION. I IS THAT WE ASK SIGNIFICANTLY AT RISK WHEN THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON SO. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A BIG JOB THAT YOUR BACKGROUND AND CERTAINLY IN YOUR RESPONSES HERE. I THINK GIVE ME PERSONALLY A LITTLE MORE COMFORT. THEY ACTION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE IN YOUR PAST NOT CHILD PROGRESSING INTO THE FUTURE BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO LOOK CLOSELY. AT THE APPOINTEES THAT ARE ON THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING THEY NEED TO KNOW THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THERE IS ALREADY AND CERTAINLY THEIR OWN ACCOUNTABILITY. IN ISSUES LIKE THIS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND OFF WE'LL BE WATCHING IT CLOSELY AND CERTAINLY BE COMING UP WITH SOME NEW RECOMMENDATIONS. POTENTIALLY GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR RATES. THANK YOU CENTER BY. IN THE SENATE ANY QUESTIONS. COLLEAGUES PARTICIPATING REMOTELY ANY QUESTIONS OF SO PLEASE INDICATE BY USING THE RAISE YOUR HAND FUNCTION. I SEE NONE. IBM YOU KNOW WE HAVE ABOUT THE INDICATION IS WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY INDIVIDUALS WAITING ON THE- TELECONFERENCE LINE TO PARTICIPATE. WELL AS YOU KNOW WEALSO SET TWELVE NOON IS SORT OF THE STOP FOR THIS HEARING. I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES CAN'T BE EXPORT BE EXPLORED DUE TO TIME I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO PURSUE WHICH I WON'T BUT- GIVEN THE APPARENT ISSUES WITH CLINICAL PLACEMENTS ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED AND I'M TALKING TO THE BOARD- EXECUTIVE OFFICER NOW. QUESTIONS I'M GOING TO THROW OUT THERE THAT PERHAPS WE CAN GET INFORMATION ON OFFLINE OR WILL BE BACK HERE IN THE SENATE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEM BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE TIMELINE FOR DEVELOPING A PROCESS FOR THE USE OF. ADVANCED SIMULATION IN OUR NURSING TRAINING PROGRAMS IN LIEU OF SOME CLINICAL PLACEMENTS OBSTACLES THINGS THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH TO TRY TO. IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO USE A- IN GREATER. NUMBERS WITH RESPECT TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE ISSUE OF TRANSITION TO PRACTICE IN THE RULES. AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE RULES ON INDIVIDUALS WHO PERHAPS HAVE BEEN IN PRACTICE. AS NURSE PRACTITIONERS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND HOW THAT PROCESS GIVEN THE- STATUTES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE LAST YEAR. HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK- WITH REGARD TO APPROVALS BY BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. I HAVE QUESTIONS AS TO THE RATIONALE FOR THE BOARD'S ROLE IN APPROVING FACULTY MEMBERS BELOW THE LEVEL OF PROGRAM DIRECTORS IN NURSING DIRECTORS. IN OUR STATE'S NURSING PROGRAMS AND QUESTIONS WITH REGARD. TO THE NEED FOR B. R. N. TO APPROVE SPECIFIC CLINICAL **** AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT. SITUATION AND QUESTIONS REGARDING PERHAPS THE VALUE OF ADDING MORE PUBLIC MEMBERS. TO THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AMONG THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS THAT I THINK ARE STILL OUTSTANDING AND THAT I HAVE. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THOSE ADDRESSED AT SOME POINT IN TIME. BUT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS- WITH MEL B. THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY.

HOWEVER THE NLC HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND YET THERE'S NO EVIDENCE HE HAS LED TO GREATER NURSE MOBILITY OR INCREASED LABOR SUPPLY. JOINING THE COMPACT WOULD UNDERMINE PUBLIC PROTECTION BY INHIBITING CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO SET STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO ALL NURSES PRACTICING HERE.

HELLO MY NAME IS KENDRA MAHLER AND I'M A STUDENT INTERN ACT THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LAW. CPI AUTHORITY SUBMITTED A WRITTEN TESTIMONY BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TWO KEY ISSUES- FIRST WE RECOMMEND TO ADD TO PUBLIC MEMBERS TO THE BOARD. ANTILL MAN SECTION TWENTY SEVEN OH EIGHT OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE TO PRECLUDE THE BOARD EXECUTIVE OFFICER FROM BECOMING A LICENSEE OF THE BOARD ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT PUBLIC. PROTECTION IS B. R. AND- ON PRIORITY. I REDUCE IN OUR LETTER THAT. PER THAT LISTING CONTROL OVER THE BOARD PREVENT. AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AND IT EXPLODES ABOARD ITS MEMBERS TO ANTITRUST LIABILITY. AND CONTROL OVER THE SUPPLY OF NURSES IN CALIFORNIA PRESENTS A PARTICULAR RISK TO ANTI COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY. AND THE SCOPE CONTROLS NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. SECOND EMPLOYER SHOULD STAY. BURKE BE REQUIRED TO REPORT DISAPPOINTED THAT TO THE BOARD. WELL I THEIR HEALTHCARE LICENSING BOARDS MOST NOTABLY THAT MEDICAL BOARD RECEIVE A HOST OF MANAGED HEATED REPORT ABOUT THEIR LICENSEES YEAR AND RECEIVED NO SUCH SUPPORT. SIGNIFICANTLY IF THE BOARD ADMITS THAT IT CAN ONLY INVESTIGATE KNOWN ALLEGATIONS OR VIOLATIONS AND THAT THE LACK OF MANDATORY REPORTING LEADS THE PUBLIC AVERAGE. INDEED THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT MONITOR BROWN THE REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS PURSUANT TO SECTION EIGHT OH FIVE TO BE THE SINGLE HIGHEST SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. WITH RESPECT TO DETECTION OF AN ETHICAL AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS THE FACT THAT THE BEER AND DID NOT RECEIVE THESE REPORTS IS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD'S PARAMOUNT PRIORITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY TRUE IN LIGHT OF THE BOARD'S INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OVER DISCIPLINE SYSTEM. AND THE CONCERNING INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS- AS YOU HEARD FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THIS MORNING. MATAHARI WAS RAIN DURING THE BOARD'S BLACK CENTERRA BEALE AND BEYOND TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS RECOMMENDATION TO ENSURE PUBLIC PROTECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT. NINE EIGHTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON- HELLO CENTER AND A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- EVERYONE JOINING- MY NAME IS MICHAEL GOODNESS I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY YEARS I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MY FIANCE TODAY. WHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS OUT OF FEAR OF BEING RETALIATED AGAINST BY THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSES. I SAY THIS BECAUSE MY FIANCE IS AN ACTIVE LICENSE PROBATIONARY NURSE WHO CURRENTLY PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE- THAT WAS NOT MENTIONED HERE TODAY THE DIFFICULTY WHAT THE IMPORTANT PROGRAM AT THE BRD FROM DEALING WITH THOSE PRODUCTS FOR OVER A YEAR I CAN STATE THAT MY FIANCE WORKS VERY HARD TO BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE. GOT A CRIMINAL RECORD- OVER TEN YEARS AGO THAT SHE WAS- OVER TEN YEARS AGO AND WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION- IT WOULD NOT AFFECT YOUR DO THE BILL AB TWO ONE THREE EIGHT. THAT WAS PACKED IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY. MY FIANCE GRADUATED IN MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND SHE FOUGHT FOR OVER A YEAR TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR LICENSE AND WAS GRANTED A PROBATIONARY LICENSE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. THE PART THAT IT IS HEARTENING POSSESSION PASSED ALL BACKGROUND CHECKS BEGIN THE CLINICAL WHAT'S UP FRONT WITH THEIR NURSING PROGRAM- ABOUT HER EX BUDGET RECORD. BUT STILL FELL. THE BACKGROUND WHETHER IT. A PARTY BUT OCCASIONALLY JOB. FOR AND- MY FIANCE'S CASE WAS FIGHTING FOR A RECORD OF OVER A DECADE AGO- WELL LEADING UNDER LICENSE SHE CONTACTED. ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND WALDRON- RIVERSIDE UNDER MELENDEZ AND- PROBATIONARY MANAGER JOHN KNOWLES AND EVEN THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR NYESOM. ALL TO NO AVAIL EVEN EVENTUALLY SHE WAS FORCED TO ACCEPT THREE YEARS PROBATION AND AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE. FOR FAMILY SINCE THE MUCH TIME HAD A LAPSE THAT SHE NEEDED AN INCOME TO PROVIDE FOR CHILDREN. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE CAN SIMPLY RIGHT- CONTINUALLY RUN INTO. IS THE STIPULATIONS ONE THROUGH NINETEEN. WHICH RECALL- REQUIRED. THE PROBATIONERS TO DO MANY THINGS AND JUMP THROUGH MANY HOOPS TO STEAL THE PRACTICE. I SEE ON TO WORKED AT HEMET GLOBAL MEDICAL CENTER FOR FOUR YEARS HAD FORTY EIGHT LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAD NEVER. HAD AN ISSUE AND SHE WORKED IN THE PANDEMIC AND EVEN GOT COLLUDED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHILE PREGNANT. SHE FIGHTS VERY HARD TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PATIENT. LEFT BARELY. FORTUNATELY NOW THAT THE PANDEMIC DIED DOWN. SHE'S BEEN LET GO FOR JOBS TO THE DUE TO THE EMPLOYER NOT WANTED TO FOLLOW PROBATIONARY TERMS ANYMORE. BECAUSE SHE WAS FORCED TO TEST DURING WORK WHILE URGING KERR'S- WERE CLOSED EARLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS CONCERNING IS THIS A NURSES CAUGHT DIVERTING MEDICATIONS ON THE JOB THE RECORD. IS NOT PERMANENT I WILL FOLLOW UP HER LIFE WHEN HER DIVERSIONARY PROGRAM COMPLETE. A PROBATIONARY MERIT AT THE RECORDS THEY ON A LIGHTNING FOREVER. EVEN THOUGH THE COMMISSIONER AND ARTS WORKS SO HARD TO COMPLETE ALL STIPULATIONS INCOME OCCUPATION. AS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL. THIS MAKES IT HARD FOR PROBATIONERS TO GET A JOB. NOT ONLY WHILE ON PROBATION BUT AFTER ALSO. A. B. R. IN THE CLAIMS TO BE FOR THE WORKING PROBATIONARY NURSE MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PROBATIONARY NURSE THE OTHER HOLD ON THE JOB. I ASK THAT THE PROBATIONARY PROCESS BE REVIEWED AND WE CATCH UP. THE DISCIPLINARY. PROCESS TO YOUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT'S HEARTENING THAT A NON WRECKER OF OVER YEARS OF. AND STILL BE HELD AGAINST. WHEN I EVEN IF A CALL. IS THAT TRAIN MORE. BY FIANCE OVER SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH THE KEEPER LICENSING STANDING INCLUDING- SUPPORT GROUPS. PROTESTING THANK ON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION WHICH SHE NOW STRUGGLES HEY NOW THAT IS WHAT THEIR JOB. I'M ASKING AND BEGGING YOU ALL PLEASE CONSIDER A CHANGE AND IT'S NOT THAT AS I SPEAK FOR MANY STATIONARY TODAY WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM. ALL NURSES CAN. BECOME ALSO DRUG TESTING THAT YEAR BEHAVIOR. BUT HER SPECIFIC MONITOR. BY EIGHT IS NEVER SEEN APPROVED HERE BUT IT SHOULD BE OUR AND CITED A LOT OF FEEDBACK- IN MY CARE LET ME MAKE SURE I MEAN BECAUSE LET ME MAKE A SUGGEST MYSELF AND HEARD WHICH IS LIKE THE EIGHT AND THE CHANGE. THAT THIS BE ARE IN DESPERATELY NEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING TO ME AND I HOPE YOU ALSO BLESS THEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND BY THE WAY IF YOU HAVE THAT IN WRITING YOU CAN CLEAN IT UP TO MAKE IT ANONYMOUS BUT THE COMMITTEES JOINT COMMITTEES WOULD APPRECIATE. SEATING THAT IN WRITING SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATEMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND- SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO- SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADJUST DURING HIS SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS SO LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT WRITING SIR. NEXT. MONTEREY. NINE NINE NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. AM I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT THE EXECUTIVE. I FELT COMFORTABLE COMMITTING FRAUD BECAUSE THERE WAS AND STILL IS A CULTURE OF CORRUPTION AND UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR AT THE BOARD. HELLO RENDON MELBY STATED THAT THERE'S NEW MANAGEMENT THE BOARD BUT THAT NEW MANAGEMENT ONLY HERE BECAUSE OF NEPOTISM. IF IT'S AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BOARD YVONNE LETTER OPENLY BOASTED THAT SHE WOULD BRING HER OWN PEOPLE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO AND SO IF SHE COULD. THE RECENTLY HIRED CAREER EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT OF LICENSING THE CHIEF OF OPERATIONS AND THE MANAGER OF THE CALL CENTER- ALL THE IO'S FORMER COLLEAGUE. OF ALL THE APPLICANTS FOR THESE POSITIONS THAT WERE QUALIFIED JEFF STONE HAPPENS TO BE THE EIGHTY YEAR OLD FORMER CO WORKERS. AND FACEBOOK FRIENDS. MANAGEMENT SAID THE TONE AND THEY HAVE MADE IT TO PASS THAT ALONG TO IS A ACCEPT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME NEXT. MONTEREY- NINE EIGHTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOUTHANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR MARIANNE VAN DAMME. I'M I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF NURSING AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND I'M REPRESENTING THE VOICES OF THE OTHER EIGHTEEN DIRECTORS OF SCHOOL NURSING- I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE POINTS- ONE OF THEM IS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF STIMULATION ALLOWED. BY THE B. R. AND NOW THERE WAS SOME TALK TODAY ABOUT- I WAS HAPPY- LONG. ABILITY TO HAVE CRITICAL PLACES THAT IS FUNCTIONALLY NOT TRUE- BECAUSE OTHER VARIABLES ARE FOR GOT. SUCH BAD- THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION THAT THE STUDENTS NEEDS AND THEN THE SPECIALTY THAT WE MUST SPELL SO ALL OF THOSE ARE. ALL THE BOTTLENECKS. YEAH INTO THE THREE PARENTS. THAT THE SPOT DATA STATES THAT THERE ARE- I WOULD ALL. LIKE POINT OUT THAT WOULD BE OF WE HAVE THIS INCREASING- NUMBER OF. S. IN THE LAST FIVE CAN YEARS- THAT WE WERE ESPECIALLY BADLY HIT THE PANDEMIC CASH INCLUDED A TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT DEGREES OUR ABILITY. TO GO FORTH WITH NURSING EDUCATION. I THAT HAS HELPED US GREATLY- HOWEVER GOING BACK 225% RATHER THAN THE EIGHTY EIGHT WILL NOT BE THE ANSWER TO US BECAUSE WE NEED TO SECURE A CLINICAL PLACEMENT HOURS. AND THAT ISSUE IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY AFTER THE PANDEMIC. SO WE ARE ASKING TO PERMANENTLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF. NON DIRECT PATIENT HOURS YEAH I QUALITY SIMULATION EXPERIENCES. OTHER BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING IN THIS COUNTRY- HOW. MANY MORE NON DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS AGAIN CALIFORNIA DOES ONLY 15% OF THOSE BOARDS CAP THAT AT TWENTY FIVE EDGE. OF CALIFORNIA DOES PRESENTLY. STUDY SHOWS IBM THE CSU BEYOND SPECULATION STARTED TO TWENTY FOURTEEN SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE THE QUALITY OF THE NEW GRADUATE. WHEN COMPARED 225% OTHER WORDS THE GRADUATES LEARN JUST AS WELL AND SOME DATA SHOWS THAT THEY COME OUT WITH BETTER CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND DECISION. MAKING SKILLS BUT WE ARE ASKING PLEASED TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT PATIENT CARE HOURS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AND ALSO INCREASE THE AMOUNT. OF QUALITY IN THE NATION. THE OTHER POINT ON TO MAKE IS OF ON GOING. ON CONCURRENT J. OF SCARY AND PRACTICE- PRESENT MAYBE WE HAVE. OUR HANDS RATHER. BECAUSE MUST. YOU DON'T TO OF THEY ARE REAL- THAT'LL BE GIVEN AND THE CLINIC LOOKS- WE HAVE TO DO IT CONCURRENT WHILE OTHER- AREAS OF HEALTHCARE DOES SUCH AS AND PHYSICAL THERAPY. OUR ABLE TO PURSUE THAT THE AND THEN GIVE THE FACT CALIXTE. THAT CERTAINLY GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO WITH STRATEGY THAT IS OFTEN BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE THAN JUST ONE WEEK OF GEARING. BEFORE THEY ARE PLACED IN A HOSPITAL THAT IS UNPREDICTABLE AS TO WHAT THEY COME UP TO. IT THAT IS- IT FOR NOW I THINK YOU FOR CONSIDERING. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS NEXT.
