WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AIR AND COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. WANNA START SAYING I ACCEPTED THE COMMITMENTS AND HOUSING THIS MORNING BUT I THINK IT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS- AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S A HOUSING PRODUCTION GOAL TO CREATE ROUGHLY HREE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE PLANS TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION SO WERE AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS I MEAN WE'RE ACTUALLY. BUILDING ALL OF THOSE AS YOU KNOW. SO WE ARE FALLING SHORT OF THAT GOAL. ONE METHOD INCREASE SUPPLIES THROUGH SMALL SCALE AND CRIMINAL A HOUSING POLICY SUCH AS EASING PRODUCTION PRESSURES WITHOUT MAKING DRASTIC CHANGES TO THEY WERE A NEIGHBORHOODS FABRIC. MODEST MULTI FAMILY HOUSING LIKE DUPLEXES TRI PLEX IS QUAD LEX'S- CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INCREASING SUPPLY IN THIS IS I THINK. IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY USED TO A LOT OF THOSE FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS GO WE HAVEN'T AS MUCH BECAUSE- OF SOME OF THE SINGLE FAMILY ZONING ISSUES THAT- I KNOW. MANY OF US A FACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE OF LOS ANGELES- IF 20% OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THAT WERE SOWN FOR JUST TWO HOMES DUPLEXES. THE LOCAL HOUSING STOCK WOULD INCREASE BY SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. IN SAN FRANCISCO OF JUST FAMILY HOMES A COMMENTED TO UNITS. THERE IS HOUSING STOCK COULD GROW BY ALMOST 19% OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. AB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE INSURERS MORE LAND IS ON FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AND ABOVE MODERATE AND MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT SORT OF MISSING MIDDLE MODERATE INCOME IS VERY KEY. WITH ME TODAY TO SUPPORT- TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS LUIS MANTE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA EMB. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT- WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH PREVIOUS OPPOSITION THEY ARE NOT NEUTRAL- AND WE ALSO HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THIS MORNING'S HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. MORNING OR AFTERNOON RATHER MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I LUIS MANTE WITH CALIFORNIA BE AYE WE'RE SUPPORTING AB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE IT'S- BY. THE WAY TO GO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO. A FOCUS ON ZONING- FOR MORE MODEST- MIDDLE- A MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING- THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS BUT RATHER ENCOURAGES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO. ATONE FOR PHIL AS A OF COME. WITH THEIR STING READ A HOUSE AT NEED THAT PATIENT. WE THINK THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE INFILL WORK WE THINK IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO MORE MISSING. MIDDLE HOUSING WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST FORMS OF HOUSING TO PRODUCE. AND ONE OF THE CHEAPEST FORMS OF HOUSING TO RIGHT. NOW SO WE ARE VERY HAPPY. WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANKS FOR. THANK YOU THE OTHER. TWENTY WITH THE A CALIFORNIA PARDON ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE YES. I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE TASHA. QUESTION. SO I HAD A COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON THAT CAN A COUPLE HARDER QUESTIONS SO WHEN THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT. JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE NEXT ROUND AROUND OF HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATES ARE DOING APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS THAT CORRECT. I COULD WRITE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE SORRY IF IT'S ABLE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CITIES LIKE MINE HAVE TO GO TO VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. SO ASKING CITIES AND GIVING THEM ONLY THREE MONTHS TO POTENTIALLY REVISED A PUBLICALLY VETTED PLAN TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS BILL GOING INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IS AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN I THINK ON MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WANT TO EMBRACE THE CPO. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IS CHANGING THE EFFECTIVE DATE SO IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE NEW RENO CYCLE THAT IS. I'M SURE IT'S APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THOSE HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED- BECAUSE IT IS ONLY MORE TIME THEY'RE DOING WE'RE DOING OUT WHICH ALREADY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CYCE. AND ALL OF MY CITIES IN MY JURISDICTION AND SO ADDING THIS AFTER THE FACT WILL BE WILL BE A VERY UNDUE BURDEN AND SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CORRECTING BEFORE IT WOULD COME TO A FLOOR VOTE TICKETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- COULD YOU DEFINE WHAT METROPOLITAN JURISDICTION MEANS I KNOW WHERE THE IMMENSELY TOOK. THIS IS TAKE OUT THE BERMAN JURISDICTIONS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM HOSPITALS USING CENSUS TRACT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXCLUDE WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER NECESSARILY BERMAN COULD YOU SPECIFY WHERE EXACTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS WOULD APPLY. SURE METROPOLITAN CITIES OUR POPULATIONS OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND- INCLUDE ING ALAMEDA COUNTIES ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA ELDORADO LOS ANGELES BRAND. OF ORANGE COUNTY PLASTER THE RIVERSIDE. SACRAMENTO SAMBAR DID INTEND TO GO SAN FRANCISCO CEMETERY YELLOW. SO IT'S METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE CONSIDERED BY COUNTIES. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE REALLY GETTING AT THE CORE OF WHAT MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER METROPOLITAN I THINK THERE'S SOME AREAS THAT WANT TO BE VERY URBAN AND SOME AREAS THAT WANT TO BE SUBURBAN AND I THINK THIS BILL WOULD UNDULY OVERTAKE LOCAL CONTROL AND I WANT TO POINT OUT AND IN MY CITY AND MY CITY ANTHONY THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT HOUSING CITY- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ARE SPECIFIC PLANS. IN OUR ELEVEN TO OUR EIGHTEEN THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE WE ALLOWED DUPLEXES BY RIGHT SEC EVEN IN DIFFICULT PLEASE THERE ARE PLACES THAT ARE ZONING FOR DUPLEXES ALREADY AND SO I WOULD WONDER WHAT IS YOUR LOGIC WHY WE NEED THIS BILLS WHEN IT'S COMPLETELY WITHIN LOCAL CONTROL POWER. TO DO THIS ALREADY. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MANY CITIES ARE NOT IF MY CITIES DOING IT LOTS OF CITIES CAN DO IT I HAVE TO BE FRANK. I CAN ANSWER A LITTLE BIT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT- THE STATE'S. HOUSING ELEMENT LAW CURRENTLY GIVES- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THREE YEARS TO COMPLY TO UPDATE THEIR ZONING CODES- TO MATCH WHAT THE REGION- ALLOCATES TO THEM THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT- WHAT IT DOES CHANGE IS IT ESTABLISHES A- VERY MODEST DENSITY STANDARDS FOR. THE MODERATE AND ABOVE MOD CATEGORIES I WHICH CITIES LIKE% YOURS RT COMPLY FOR THE LOW END VERY LOW. ON THE VET LOW IN VERY LOW ALLOCATIONS THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THEIR WE DON'T ALL COMPLY WITH LOW AND VERY LOW BUT YES WELL THEY THEY DO UPDATE THEIR SITES INVENTORIES TO IT YOU OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE A- A COMPLIANT HOUSING ELEMENT THREE TD. AND WHILE CITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE NOT. MEETING THEIR RINA TARGETS IN MANY OF THESE PLACES ESPECIALLY ACTUALLY IN THE MOD CATEGORY IN THE MODERATE CATEGORY- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO UPDATE THEIR SITES INVENTORIES AND ALL DO. MOST OF THEM SO WHAT BUT WHAT I'M SEEING IS THERE'S NO JURISDICTION IN MY DISTRICT. THAT ACTUALLY HAS INSUFFICIENT. ABOVE MODERATE CATEGORIES. ALL OF THEM ARE SUFFICIENTLY PLANNING FOR THEIR MODERATE CATEGORIES AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE IN SACRAMENTO. SIT HERE REMEMBER THAT CITIES ARE THAT THE CONTRACT THAT WE IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE WITH OUR CITIES. IS THAT THEY PLAN FOR IT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING IT SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT'S BEING BUILT AND WHAT'S BEING. PLANNED FOR THE CITY IS A RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS I THINK THERE'S A REALLY. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I THINK ISN'T WORKING. AND IT FROM SACRAMENTO OF SOMETHING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ALREADY DO BY THEMSELVES. THAT THEY'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH CD ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT MODERATE AND ABOVE MODERATE SITES. ALL CITIES IN MY JURISDICTION DO. AND WE DON'T HAVE A GAP THERE. AND IT IS A CITY HAS A GAP IN PLANNING FOR MODERATE AND A- MODERATE ABOVE MOTOR. THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT I'M SORRY. THERE HOUSING ELEMENT WILL NOT BE APPROVED. SO I THINK IF ONE WERE TO INCENTIVIZE THIS THAT'S FINE IF THE HOUSING IS THAT HE DIDN'T PLAN FOR THIS THAT'S FINE. BUT IT SHOULD BE ALREADY REQUIRES THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT MODERATE AND ABOVE MODERATE AND HOW IS CITY DOES THAT ARE JURISDICTION DOES THAT IS UP TO THEM. IT'S NOT UP TO US TO TELL THEM THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF OUR ONE ZONING. I THINK I THINK I THINK THIS BILL WOULDN'T WOULDN'T DO THAT I WOULD JUST REQUIRE THAT FOR THAT SITE THAT THEY IDENTIFIED TO MEET THEIR MODERN ABOVE MY NEEDS. 25% OF THOSE WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW AT LEAST DUPLEXES SO IN. THE CASE THAT YU'RE BRINGING UP IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ANTHONY THIS IS ALREADY COMPLYING WITH THAT. THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY CASE FOR INSIDIOUS MAY COMPLY WITH NOT- IS SUPPOSED TO LAUGH BECAUSE- CLEARLY DON'T KNOW MY CITY THANK YOU- I JUST THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S AN- OVER REACH ON OUR PART AND I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS- I THINK CITIES ARE PERFECTLY WELL WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS DECIDE. HOW THEY WANT TO REACH MODERN ABOVE MONGOLS AND THAT'S WITH THE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN CITY IN EACH CITY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE A QUESTION SURE MY READING OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE BILL BURR CITIES AS WELL AS AN OFFRAMP ON THIS IS THAT IN MY RIGHT WE VIEW THIS AS VERY FLEXIBLE WE'RE NOT DICTATING WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE TO GO WE JUST WANT 25% TO BE AVAILABLE FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT. OKAY THAT'S WHAT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET THINK THERE WOULDN'T MAY MAYBE- MY SKULL THE OF NEW THAT BUT I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL AS WELL SO I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALRIGHT ARE THERE ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALREADY SO DENY AND THERE OKAY WE ASK QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE A MOTION.
