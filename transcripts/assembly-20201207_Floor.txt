MADAM CLERK AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO NOMINATE ANTHONY RENDON AS SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. COLLEAGUES WE HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE HONOR TO REPRESENT OUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS BY THE VOTERS AND WITH THE- THE WE HAVE JUST TAKEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY NOW RESTS UPON US TO BE THE VOICE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAS A VOICE OF ONE SOMETIMES THAT RESPONSIBILITY IT CAN BE LIKENED TO A BARKING DOG AT A SPEEDING LOCOMOTIVE. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE TO HAVE A STRONG AND PROVEN LEADER WHO KNOWS THE VALUE OF THE COLLECTIVE VOICE OF COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP IT IS SAID THAT A LEADER WITH NO ONE FOLLOWING IS SIMPLY A PERSON TAKING A WALK IN THE PARK WELL IT HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT A WALK IN THE PARK FOR SPEAKER RENDON THE PAST FEW YEARS. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP THE STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WAS EXTENDED. THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE WAS INCREASED A LANDMARK FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PLAN WAS PASSED. CALIFORNIA'S CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WAS EXTENDED. A FIRST OF ITS KIND REGULATION OF PREDATORY LENDING HISTORIC RENTER PROTECTIONS AN IMPORTANT HOUSING LEGISLATION WERE ALL PASSED. ON TOP OF ALL THAT. WE WERE THRUST INTO TERRITORY UNLIKE ANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED BEFORE. YET ANTHONY RENDON EXERCISED LEADERSHIP. BY BALANCING THE SAFETY OF EIGHTY MEMBERS AND HUNDREDS OF STAFF. WITH THE NEED TO CONDUCT THE CENTRAL BUSINESS OF THE LEGISLATURE. DECISIONS WERE MADE ABOUT HOW TO PRESERVE THE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RELY ON. WHILE STILL PREPARING FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AND LIVING BUDGETARY SHORTFALL. SPEAKER RENDON WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES WITH THOUGHTFULNESS AND GRACE FOR A SIMPLE REASON. HE IS GUIDED BY A STRONG SET OF VALUES AND A CLEAR LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY. MEMBER EMPOWERMENT IS NOT JUST A CATCH PHRASE TO HIM. IT IS A PHILOSOPHY OF LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE THAT HAS INFORMED HIS DECISION MAKING THROUGHOUT HIS TENURE AS SPEAKER. IT HAS SHAPED THE WAY THAT THIS HOUSES FUNCTION AND IT HAS GIVEN US THE ECONOMY THAT WE NEED TO SERVE OR CONSTITUENTS IN THE WAY WE THINK BEST. NEVER HAS THE NEED FOR THIS APPROACH BEEN MORE EVIDENT THAN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE NOW FIND OURSELVES IN. THROUGH EXTRAORDINARY TIMES AND EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES SPEAKER RENDON HAS SERVED THIS HOUSE. ITS MEMBERS AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WITH HONOR INTEGRITY AND FORTITUDE FOR THESE REASONS I NOMINATE AT RENDON RENDON FOR SPEAKER AND ASK THAT YOU GIVE HIM YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON IS THERE A SECOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK IN MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE TO SECOND THE NOMINATION OF ANTI RENDON AS SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. THIS UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL EPIDEMIC PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED MANY OF THE BONE ABILITIES AND IT EQUITIES IN OUR SYSTEM. CALIFORNIANS ARE LOOKING TO US TO HELP ADDRESS HEALTHCARE JOB OPPORTUNITIES ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MOST IMPORTANT RACIAL INEQUITIES. WHO WE SELECT AS OUR LEADER IS NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO HELP GUIDE US THROUGH THESE CRUCIAL AND CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS SPEAKER RENDON HAS LET THIS BODY AND PASSING LANDMARK PROGRESS APOLOGIES POLICIES WITH BOTH HIS SUPPORT IN ADVOCACY. PETER RENDON HAS ROUTINELY SHOWN THE COURAGE TO DEAL WITH. AND LOOK TO DEAL WITH. BILLS THAT REQUIRE MORE TIME AND EFFORT TO IMPROVE EVEN WHEN FACING PRESSURE TO DO OTHERWISE. MISTER SPEAKER STOOD FIRMLY BY HIS COMMITMENT TO EMPOWERING HIS COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS OF HIS MEMBERS AT THE CHAIR OF A COMMITTEE MYSELF I HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF THE TRUST THE SPEAKER HAS PLACED IN US TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY OVER THIS PAST YEAR WE WERE FACED WITH DIFFICULT DECISIONS GIVEN OUR WORKFLOW CAPACITY AND BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. BAKER RUDEN RENDON HAS TIME AND TIME AGAIN DISPLAYED INCREDIBLE DEDICATION TO PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING HIS MEMBERS. SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US CAN ATTEST TO. PERHAPS NO ONE IN THIS CHAMBER IS MORE AWARE OF THE SPEAKER EFFORT TO PROTECT MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. THEY MAKE. THERE COUPLE A MILLION REASONS WHY SHOULDN'T BE HERE. SPEAKER RENDON FROM THIS POEM THAT I LEARNED IN COLLEGE INVICTUS. MADE ME INVINCIBLE AND THE ABILITY TO BE HERE IT IS THE SPEAKERS. MANDATE WHEN IT WHEN HE'S BEHIND YOU HE'S BEHIND YOU. IN THE IN THE POEM INVICTUS IS SET OUT IN THE NIGHT THAT COVERS ME BLACK AS THE PIT FROM POLE TO POLE I THANK WHATEVER GODS THERE MAY BE FOR MY UNCONQUERABLE SOUL. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT I WOULD BE HERE TODAY. AND IN THAT POEM IS TALKS ABOUT SOMEBODY BEAT IN THE DUNGEON. AND THEIR LAST BREATH. BUT THEY KEPT THEIR HEAD UP HIGH. IT ENDS WITH BEYOND THIS PLACE OF WRATH AND TEARS LOOMS BUT THE HORROR THAT THE SHADE. AND YET THE MENACE OF THE YEARS FINDS AND SHALL FIND ME UNAFRAID. IT ENDS WITH I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE. I AM THE CAPTAIN OF MY SOUL EACH OF US IS THE MASTER OF OUR OWN FATE. BUT WE NEED A CAPTAIN. TWO LEADING THE SPEAKERSHIP A CAPTAIN. THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS ASSEMBLY MEETS ALL THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE COMING UP. AS WE ENTER INTO THIS SESSION. OUR SPEAKERS PROVEN LEADERSHIP WILL BE CRUCIAL IN THIS BODY SUCCESS ON BEHALF. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. HE'S THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP. IT WOULD BE A TITANIC MISTAKE IF WE DID NOT REELECT ANTHONY RENDON AS SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH YOU ARE RECOGNIZED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION. MADAM CLERK AND MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION FOR ANTHONY RENDON TO CONTINUE AS OUR SPEAKER. HAVING JUST COMPLETED MY FIRST TERM AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY HELD BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE SPEAKERS LEADERSHIP MADE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFICULT TRANSITION SO MUCH EASIER. HIS ACCESSIBILITY AND SUPPORT WHEN IT CAME TO ENSURING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SERVE MY DISTRICT ENABLE ME TO FOCUS MY ATTENTION ON BEING AN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES. AS A PARENT OF TWO YOUNG FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS WHEN IT COMES. TO ADAPTING TO THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT THOSE OF US WITH KIDS FACE AS LEGISLATORS. CHALLENGES HE KNOWS PERSONALLY. WHEN I APPROACHED HIM AND HIS TEAM OF SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE OUR HOUSE FRIENDLIER FOR WORKING PARENTS MY SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN HEARD AND TO A LARGE DEGREE IMPLEMENTED. HE IS AFFORDED US THE TIME TO CARE FOR FAMILIES WHILE ENSURING WE HAVE THE SUPPORT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE IMPORTANT WORK. WE HAVE TO THE OLD TO HEAR. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. I KNOW HOW RARE IT IS TO FIND A TRUE SERVANT LEADERS. ESPECIALLY IN THE POLITICAL WORLD. AND I CERTAINLY CAN EXPECT WHEN I CAME TO THE SIMPLY THAT I WOULD FIND IT AND OUR SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON. SPEAKER RENDON IS ONE OF THOSE RARE SERVANT LEADERS WHO PUTS THE NEEDS OF THE TEAM OF OUR HOUSE. ABOVE HIS OWN. HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE RELIES ON EMPOWERING LEGISLATORS RATHER THAN OVERPOWERING US. HE WORKS HARD TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD WELCOMES DISSENTING VIEWS AND HAS NO RESERVATIONS ABOUT OTHERS LEADING THE WAY ON ISSUES. THIS IS ENABLED US TO MAXIMIZE THE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. AND OUR STATE RESULTING IN SOME CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE'RE FACING BEFORE AND ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WILL COME. THAT MEMBERS IS WHY HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IS SO CRITICAL AT THIS TIME. WITH CALIFORNIA IN THE THROES OF A PANDEMIC. AND A LONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY TO COME WE NEED SOMEONE WHO ENCOURAGES NEW IDEAS AND EMPOWER EVERYONE AROUND HIM TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. MADAM CLERK IN MEMBERS I SECOND THE NOMINATION OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANTHONY RENDON DICKINSON HERE CONTINUE TO SERVE AS OUR SPEAKER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO SECOND THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY RENDON AS SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. SPEAKER RENDON WILL AND HAS EMPOWER THIS BODY AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. AND IMPERIAL SPEAKER HE IS NOT. HE EMPOWERS MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE CHAIRS TO REPRESENT THEIR DISTRICTS AND POLICY AGENDAS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. THIS BOTTOM UP APPROACH IS COUNTER TO WHAT SOME OUTSIDE THIS ELECTED BODY MAY DESIRE. BUT IT IS GOOD FOR THE INSTITUTION AND CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF THE STATE'S FOUNDING FATHERS AND MOTHERS. MR RENDON REPRESENTS A DISTRICT JUST TO THE NORTH OF ME HE IS PRESENT IN HIS DISTRICT AND REPRESENTS IT WITH PRIDE. ABILITY AND UNDERSTANDING. HIS DISTRICT HAS MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE IMMIGRANTS AND MANY OF THE POLICIES THIS BODY HAS ADOPTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR DIRECT RESULT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIS DISTRICT AND THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN IT. MOST TO GREW UP OR GROWING UP MUCH LIKE HIM. WITHOUT THE QUALIFICATION I SECOND THAT NOMINATION OF ANTHONY RENDON TO BE SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY HE IS A CLASS ACT LISTEN AND CARES GREATLY ABOUT THIS INSTITUTION AND THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON YOUR RECOGNIZED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION. MADAM CHIEF CLERK IN MEMBERS IT IS MY HONOR TO STAND IN SECOND THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY RENDON TO CONTINUE AS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. THIS IS ALSO MY FIRST OFFICIAL ACT REPRESENTING MY CONSTITUENTS. MISTER TOM AND GLORIA RENDON ANTHONY'S PARENTS. I WRITE THE NOMINATION OF MR RENDON BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE FOR LEGISLATOR IF HIS OR HER VOTE ON THE STATE BUDGET AND WHO LEADERS IN THAT PROCESS. THE BUDGET REFLECTS WHO WE ARE AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHO WE ARE AS A STATE. IT REPRESENTSOUR PERSONAL VALUES AND THE PROMISES MADE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT SENTENCE HERE TODAY. THERE CAN BE NO BUDGET WITHOUT AN ASSEMBLY SPEAKER SKILLED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND LOYAL TO THE PUBLIC TRUST PLACED IN OUR CHARGE. AS SPEAKER MR RENDON HAS OVERSEEN THE ADOPTION OF FOR MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. IN HIS FIRST YEAR SPEAKER HE PRODUCED A BALANCED BUDGET ON TIME WHICH INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. IN HIS SECOND YEAR SPEAKER HE LED THIS BODY IN PASSING LEGISLATION TO SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION CRISIS BEST APPLE SCREEN THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN STATE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AND DECADE. BUILDING ON HIS EARLIER WORK IN AUTHORING PROPOSITION ONE A SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR WATER BOND HE LED THIS BODY IN THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO REPAIR THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY. WHICH GAVE AWAY FORCING OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO EVACUATE AND CREATED AN ONGOING THREAT TO THEIR LIVES AND PROPERTY. AS YOU MAY KNOW. MY PUBLIC SERVICE CAREER STARTED AS A STAFF MEMBER FOR SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN. MISTER BROWN ALWAYS SAID MY ONLY CONSTITUENCY IS THE EIGHTY MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE. WHEN MR RENDON BECAME SPEAKER HE PUT IT THIS WAY. I WANT EACH OF YOU TO ACHIEVE THE BEST AND THE MOST FOR THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT. I BELIEVE EVERYONE HERE TO RESERVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CAN ADVOCATE FORCEFULLY FOR THEIR IDEAS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS. MR RENDON I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT EVERY MEMBERS RESPONSIBILITY AT THE VANGUARD FOR THEIR DISTRICTS AND FOR THE PUBLIC TRUST. I BELIEVE HIS STAYED TRUE TO THAT PROMISE. IN HIS TIME AS SPEAKER HIS HELP MEMBERS CHANGE THE FACE OF CALIFORNIA TO ONE THAT IS MORE DIVERSE COMPASSIONATE AND CHEST. WHEN EVERYONE SHELTERED IN PLACE MR RENDON WAS IN THE CAPITAL AVAILABLE TO ALL MEMBERS STATE AGENCIES AND THE GOVERNOR TO HELP FIGHT THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER. HE STILL FOUND TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN ASSUME MEETING WITH THE GOVERNMENT CLASS FROM HIS COLLEGE ALMA MATER. HE WAS ASKED HOW THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED HIS RESPONSIBILITIES AS SPEAKER. HE RESPONDED WELL NORMALLY THERE ARE AT LEAST ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WORKING IN THE CAPITAL ON ANY GIVEN DAY. NOW THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE AND ME. I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT MR RENDON MADE TIME FOR THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE HE DID THE SAME FOR ME. MY MOM RECENTLY TESTED POSITIVE FOR COKE IN NINETEEN. AND SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED I TOLD NO ONE OUTSIDE MY FAMILY. I WAS AT HOME WAITING FOR AN UPDATE FROM THE HOSPITAL AND MY PHONE RANG. IT WAS MR RENDON. HE SAID LISA I AM SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR MOM HOW CAN I HELP TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO TO SUPPORT YOU. LUCKILY MY MOM IS GETTING BETTER BUT THAT MOMENT TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT THE MAN. THAT HE WOULD TAKE TIME TO CALL AND CHECK ON ME AND OFFER HIS SUPPORT. HE'S NOT FORGOTTEN WHY HE WENT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND HE KNOWS THAT EACH OF US CHOSE TO RUN. BECAUSE THOUGH WE FEEL THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS. WE WANT TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. MR RENDON HAS PROVEN HIS SKILL EXPERIENCE AND COMPASSION AND STRENGTH TO LEAD. I AM HONORED AND PROUD TO SECOND THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY RENDON FOR SPEAKER BECAUSE HE IS THE KIND OF LEADER THAT CAN HELP US MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THE RIGHT PERSON TO LEAD US THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS YOUR RECOGNIZED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK MEMBERS. SO TODAY IT IS MY HONOR. TO RE NOMINATE ANTHONY RENDON AS SPEAKER OF THIS ASSEMBLY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT EVERYONE HERE KNOWS. WHAT WE CAN SEE JUST BY LOOKING AROUND. THIS IS BEEN AN UNUSUAL YEAR. IT'S BEEN A HARD YEAR. AND WE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS ACCOMPLISHED. DESPITE THIS BEING ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING LEGISLATIVE PERIODS IN STATE HISTORY. WE'VE TAKEN ACTION TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES. TO PROVIDE PAID MEDICAL LEAVE FOR WORKERS WHO. BEEN POSITIVE COVER NINETEEN. AND WE'VE COVERED THE TESTING AND TREATMENT FOR THE UNINSURED. WE'VE SECURED THE BILLIONS IN FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS. NOT TO MENTION THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES FROM THE GROWING PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS. TO ENSURE IN OUR STATE FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. THIS NEXT YEAR IN SESSION. IS GOING TO BRING MORE CHALLENGES. SOME WE CAN ANTICIPATE. AND SOME WE CANNOT. AND AS WE FACE WHAT'S COMING WE NEED A STEADY HAND WE NEED A LEADER. A LEADER WITH EXPERIENCE. A LEADER WHO LISTENS AND EMPOWERS EACH ONE OF US TO GET THINGS DONE. WE ALL HAVE STORIES OF WORKING WITH SPEAKER RENDON TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. UNDER THIS SPEAKER. WE HAVE SET TRENDS TRENDS THAT THE NATION FOLLOWS THAT AS WE HAVE HEARD. A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME WAGES FOR FARMWORKERS AN EFFORT THAT WAS A BOLD STEP TOWARDS JUSTICE. EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE AN AMBITIOUS NEW CLIMATE GOALS. THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION. A PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A STATE WIDE USE OF FORCE STANDARD FOR POLICE OFFICERS A STANDARD THAT WAS IN EXAMPLE. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. THE SPEAKER HAS MADE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AND MANY MANY OTHERS. AND HE'S DONE SO HE'S MADE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS POSSIBLE. HE'S DONE IT BY EMPOWERING MEMBERS. BY BUILDING COALITIONS AND CONSENSUS. HE IS THE GRANDSON OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS. HE'S WORKED MANUAL LABOR. AND THAT WAS. BEFORE HE EARNED HIS DEGREES ONE FROM ONE OF OUR GREAT STATE UNIVERSITIES CSU. FULLERTON I BELIEVE. AND THEN A PHD FROM ANOTHER UC RIVERSIDE. HE LED THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. HE LET A CHILD DEVELOPMENT NONPROFIT AND WHEN THE STATE CUT EDUCATION FUNDING HE RAN FOR OFFICE AND HE RAN FOR OFFICE TO FIGHT FOR KIDS. THIS IS A MAN WHO EMBODIES. WHAT YOU DREAM. FROM HUMBLE I'M A HUMBLE START. TO A COMMUNITY LEADER THE SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. HIS LIFE HAS GIVEN HIM EMPATHY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS. AS WELL AS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN THIS STATE. WHAT MUST CONTINUE TO BE POSSIBLE IN OUR GREAT STATE. THIS NEXT TERM WILL BE CHALLENGING BUT I'M ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT HAT UNDER SPEAKER RENDON'S STEADY LEADERSHIP. WE WILL HONOR THE PRICE THAT HAS BEEN PLACED IN EACH ONE OF US. WE WILL HELP LEAD OUR STATE OUT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. AND WE WILL KEEP WORKING TOWARDS GREATER EQUALITY GREATER JUSTICE AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. FOR HIS RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. I AM VERY PROUD TO RE NOMINATE ANTHONY RENDON FOR SPEAKER CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS ARE THERE FURTHER NOMINATIONS FOR THE OFFICES SPEAKER THIS FAMILY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY YOUR RECOGNIZED. I RISE TO NOMINATE THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM SAN DIEGO MARIE WALDRON TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. REGARDLESS OF PARTY AFFILIATION IDEOLOGICAL MEANING. OR INTEREST GROUP ATTACHMENTS. I'D URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR A SIMPLE REASON. SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO WORK THIS YEAR. SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVED WE SHOULD HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AT A TIME OF EXCEPTIONAL CHALLENGES FOR STATE GOVERNMENT SHE THOUGHT THAT A STATE LAWMAKERS WE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO GOVERN. MANY OF US FELT THE SAME WAY. WE CALLED ON THE LEGISLATORS LEADERS TO TAKE THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS SERIOUSLY. AND THE LEGISLATURE DID TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. FOR ITSELF. THE CAPITAL WAS SHUT DOWN FOR MONTHS STRICT PROTOCOLS WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST ALL COMMITTEES IN FOUR SESSIONS WERE CANCELED WE'RE IN A BASKETBALL ARENA. LEGISLATORS DID EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. WELL LEAVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BEREFT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTIONS THE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. AS GROSSLY CROKES CONSTRUCTION WORKERS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND MILLIONS OF OTHER CALIFORNIANS KEPT DOING THESE ESSENTIAL JOBS. LEGISLATORS REFUSED TO DO THERE'S OUR INSTITUTION VANISHED DEEMING ITSELF IN ESSENTIAL. WE SAT BACK AND WATCHED AS GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SEES THE LEGISLATIVE POWER FOR HIMSELF. FALSELY CLAIMING THAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY NO MATTER HOW LONG IT LASTS TRANSFORMS CALIFORNIA INTO AN AUTOCRACY. END QUOTE CENTRALIZES THE STATE'S POWERS IN HIS HANDS. IMAGINE IF WE HAD DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IF WE HAVE EARNED OUR PAYCHECKS IF WE HAD STOOD OUR GROUND IF WE DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION. IF WE HAD ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND MET THE CHALLENGES OF THIS YEAR HAD ON. WE COULD HAVE BUILT UP OUR HOSPITAL CAPACITY SUPPORTER ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AND PROTECTED THE VULNERABLE. WE COULD HAVE AVERTED THE EDT TRAIN WRECK THAT IS KEPT FOOD OFF THE TABLE OF MILLIONS. FROM THE BEGINNING WE COULD HAVE INSISTED ON DATA AND EVIDENCE FOCUSED ON WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND AVOIDED THE NEVER ENDING NO NOTHING NIGHTMARE OF COLORS IN TWO YEARS CURFEWS AND LOCKDOWNS ATTESTATIONS AND EMERGENCY BREAKS. WE COULD HAVE SAID. IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP MILLIONS OF KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL. WIDENING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS STUNTING DEVELOPMENT DAMAGING MENTAL HEALTH CONCEALING ABUSE DIMINISHING WHITE PROSPEX SHORTENING LIFE EXPECTANCY YOU BETTER HAVE A DARN GOOD REASON FOR IT. WE COULD HAVE MANAGED OUR STATE'S RESPONSE TOGETHER. AS ONE PEOPLE. WITH A SHARED FATE. INSTEAD OF REVERTING TO A PRETTY MODERN SEPARATION OF THE RULER AND THE RULED. WHEN I ADDRESS THIS ASSEMBLY ON MARCH SIXTEENTH. I SAID THE PARTISAN RITUALS OF ORDINARY POLITICS HAVE NO PLACE IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. I CALL THEN ON EVERY LEGISLATOR IN EVERY CALIFORNIAN REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PREFERENCE TO QUOTE TRUST IN GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S LEADERSHIP AND LISTEN TO HIS GUIDANCE. GAVIN NEWSOM MADE A MOCKERY OF THAT TRUST. TAKE YOUR POINT OF THE POINT OF ORDER. WELL I DON'T WORKABLE. WITH DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE I BELIEVE THAT PERHAPS THE PREEMINENT QUESTIONS AS FAR AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE NEXT SPEAKER IS WHO IS BEST SUITED TO STAND UP TO OUR GOVERNOR AND TO RE INSERT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THE NOMINATION. WITHIN WEEKS GOVERNOR NEWSOM HID FROM THE LEGISLATURE A ONE BILLION DOLLAR NO BID CONTRACT WITH THE POLITICAL ALLY. OUTSOURCED THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS THE POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS AND STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE CORONA VIRUS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW PROGRESSIVE ERA. AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESHAPE THE WAY WE DO pBUT AS THIS LEGISLATURE WATCHED. THE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN ANYTHING BUT PROGRESSIVE. OUR ECONOMY IS DOING ABOUT THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. OUR KIDS IN POOR COMMUNITIES ARE FARING WORST OF ALL OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PERFORMANCE IS MIDDLING. WITH THE BASIC PILLARS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY DISMANTLED. OUR BODY POLITIC IS DISENFRANCHISED. AND DIVIDED EVEN THE HIGH PRIEST OF DATA ANALYSIS NATE SILVER. JUST REFERRED TO THE QUOTE. IRRATIONAL AND NOT VERY SCIENCE DRIVEN REGIME OF COVERT POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE FACT IS OUR GOVERNOR HAS LOST ALL CREDIBILITY WITH THE PUBLIC. AND WHATEVER THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. IN THIS MOMENT WE HAVE ONE INHERENT ADVANTAGE. WE ARE NOT GAVIN NEWSOM. IS A KILEY YOUR TIME IS ON WE NEED TO TAKE UP THE BATON THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDED BACK HANDED OFF IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WORK TOGETHER TO REBUILD TRUST AND FORGE A BETTER PATH FORWARD AND THAT'S WHERE I NOMINATE. THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM SAN DIEGO MARIE WALDRON WHO I KNOW WAS PREPARED TO GET WORKING. FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK MISTER KILEY IS THEIR SECOND. ASSEMBLY WOMAN DAVY SECONDED THE MOTION. ARE THERE ANY FURTHER NOMINATIONS. FEARING NINE NOMINATIONS ARE NOW CLOSED FOR THE OFFICE THE SPEAKER OF THE FAMILY IN THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTION THE RULES AND PRECEDENTS REQUIRING A RECORDED ROLL CALL VOTE WILL BE SUSPENDED TO ALLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

AND THAT YOU WILL WELL AND FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE DUTIES UPON WHICH YOU'RE ABOUT TO ENTER IF SO PLEASE AFFIRM YOUR- BY STATING I DO. I DO. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR RE ELECTING ME AS YOUR SPEAKER OFF HONORED TO BE CHOSEN AGAIN FOR THIS OFFICE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO RISE TO THE HONOR I WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MEMBER SPEAKER THAT IS WHY WHO CONSULTS WITH MEMBERS AND MAKES DECISIONS FOR THE BENEFIT. OF THE MEMBERSHIP. IN ADDITION TO BEING REELECTED SPEAKER I AM OF COURSE HONORED THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE SIXTY THIRD DISTRICT. HAVE CHOSEN ME TO REPRESENT THEM AGAIN. REALLY THOUGH. IT IS THE WORK OF THIS BODY. THAT IS EARNING US THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. TODAY REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA MEANS TREATING CO THAT SERIOUSLY. FOR THAT REASON WE ARE MEETING FOR ORGANIZATIONAL SESSION IN THIS QUITE UNIQUE LOCATION. FOR THAT SAME REASON WE ARE UNABLE TO CELEBRATE THE NEW SESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR FRIENDS. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EXERCISE MAXIMUM CAUTION IN ORDER TO BRING THIS STATE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST BECAME SPEAKER. I SPOKE OF ESTABLISHING MY PRIORITIES AS OVERSIGHT FIGHTING PART POVERTY AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. SINCE THEN WE HAVE DONE REMARKABLE THINGS TO HELP OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. WE'VE EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE TO LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. WE'VE BOOSTED THE MINIMUM WAGE WE'VE EXPANDED TUITION FREE OFFERINGS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WE'VE MADE HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO CONSISTENTLY PUSHED FORWARD ON THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FRONT THE TRUEST DEMOCRACY IS THAT WERE MOST PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED. WELL SOME STATES HAVE WORKED TO DISENFRANCHISE THEIR CITIZENS CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED TO PUT THE BALLOT INTO THE HANDS OF MORE ELIGIBLE VOTERS SINCE I BECAME SPEAKER. THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR REGISTERED VOTERS TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS MORE RECENTLY. IN MORE PLACES. I WOULD DOOR MOTOR VOTER LAW MADE IT MADE SURE THAT ELIGIBLE VOTERS WERE REGISTERED AND BY PUTTING BALLOTS INTO THE HANDS OF EVERY SINGLE VOTER AND BY LETTING PEOPLE MAIL THOSE BALLOTS WITHOUT POSTAGE. WE'VE TAKENPUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO NEW HEIGHTS. THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE JUST ON THE SUBJECTS I MENTIONED WHEN I FIRST BECAME SPEAKER WE ARE OF COURSE GONE FAR BEYOND THAT. WE TOOK A DRAMATIC STEP FORWARD IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN WE ENACTED A BILL TO LIMIT POLICE USE OF FORCE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT WAS A STRUGGLE TO GET THERE BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH GOALS ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION THAT PEOPLE ONCE THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE. AND WE CREATED MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW US TO WORK TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. OUR HOUSE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING FUNDING FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. WE STOOD TOGETHER TO PASS MORE EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR EXPLOITED GIG WORKERS AND OVERTIME FOR FARMWORKERS. THOSE FARMWORKERS ARE STILL CULTIVATING THE NATION'S FOOD IN THE FACE OF HIGHER THAN AVERAGE COVE INFECTION RATES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THE WORK WE HAVE DONE TO GET OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA NATION EMBRACE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT FOR POINTING OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND EXPLOITATION BY THOSE IN POWER. THIS WAS A CALL FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PAST OPERATIONS WERE NOT ENOUGH. TO END THE PRACTICE OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT THE CAPITAL. WE EXPLORE ALL OUR PRACTICES AND IN THE END WE CHANGED EVERYTHING WE REFORM TRAINING WE TOOK INVESTIGATION OUT OF PARTISAN CONTROL WE ADOPTED POP POLICIES THAT ARE INTENDED. NOT JUST TO PUNISH BUT ALSO TO ALLOW STAFF AND MEMBERS TO LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE. I AM PROUD OF OUR WORK IN THIS AREA JUST AS I AM PROUD THAT THE ASSEMBLY HASIL REACHED THE LANDMARK A GENDER PAY PARITY FOR OUR STAFF. WE WORKED HARD ON THAT JUST AS WE WORKED HARD TO GET WOMEN ELECTED AND TO HAVE WOMEN APPOINTED AS COMMITTEE CHAIRS IN FACT SINCE I TOOK OVER THE SPEAKERSHIP IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I HAVEN'T I HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER OF WE CHAIRS MORE THE DOUBLE. WE ALSO NAMED. AND WILL OF COLOR TO. THAT HAVE NO HAD WOMEN AS LEADERS BUT- INCLUDING A AMERICA WOMEN IN BOTH SHE SARGE LET'S JUST COUNCIL AND AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN AS CHIEF CLERK. AND TODAY WE CELEBRATE ANOTHER NEW FIRST AS ELOISE GOMEZ REYES BECOMES THE BODY'S FIRST LATINA MAJORITY LEADER. STILL WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO THAT END JUST THIS PAST MONTH I HIRED A DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION CONSULTANT TO EXAMINE THE ASSEMBLY IS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO WE CAN ACHIEVE GREATER EQUITY AND INCLUSION. I WOULD ALSO LOVE TO STAND BEFORE YOU AND SAY THAT OUR POLICY EFFORTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVE BROUGHT COMPLETE EQUITY TO OUR STATE. AND ALLOWED US TO SOLVE THE POVERTY PUZZLE CALIFORNIA BUT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE. WE KNOW THAT IN THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES THE ECONOMIC GAPS HAVE GROWN WIDER IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. NOW DESPITE A BOOMING STOCK MARKET THOSE ARE LOWER TIERS ARE STILL FACING AN ECONOMIC STRUGGLE AS KOBE DRIVES MORE AND MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS TO OUR PROPERTY. A QUARTER MILLION AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM CODED IN CALIFORNIA THE TOTAL STANDS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND. IT IS TRUE THAT THE LAST TIME WE MET IN SACRAMENTO IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY BACK IN AUGUST WE WERE ALREADY FACING THE NEW AND TERRIBLE DEMANDS PRESENTED BY A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE PAST FEW MONTHS AWAY FROM SACRAMENTO HAVE GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROCESS THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING UNDER PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. I WILL ASK YOU TODAY TO USE THAT EXPERIENCE TO FOCUS THIS BODIES VISION FOR THE FUTURE. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NEW TO THE ASSEMBLY CONGRADULATIONS YOU WILL NOW HELP US TO FACE THAT CHALLENGE. WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT LEGISLATE COBIT AWAY BUT WE CAN USE CO THAT IS A LENDS FOR CHANGING THE WAY WE LOOK AT HOW WE LEGISLATE. AS A RESULT OF CODE WE HAVE SEEN ALL THESE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN YEARS I NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE IN DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES FROM BEING EVICTED. WE'VE SEEN A NEED TO PROVIDE GREATER UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IN CRISIS SITUATIONS. WE'VE SEEN AN UPSURGE IN RACIAL TENSIONS AND BIGOTRY. AS SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION ARE UNFAIRLY SINGLED OUT AND IGNORANTLY BLAMED FOR STARTING OR SPREADING THE VIRUS. AND WE'VE SEEN A NEED TO PROTECT EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S HOUSE. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE SEEN THE VIRUS AMPLIFIED LONG STANDING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT NATIVE AMERICANS BLACKS LATINOS NATIVE HAWAIIAN. AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. CARBON SHOULD TEACHERS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC MEANS IS NOT THE SAME AS A LACK OF CHARACTER. NOW MORE THAN EVER LET US REMEMBER THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. IT SHOULD INFORM HOW WE BEHAVE AT ALL TIMES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE UNITED AGAINST POVERTY AT ALL TIMES NOT JUST WHEN WE'RE AT WAR WITH CODE. SOON THERE WILL BE A KEY CHANGE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON I BELIEVE IN OUR FAVOR THAT IS THE UPCOMING CHANGE OF FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS. ALTHOUGH THERE WILL SURELY BE A DISAGREEMENT FROM A FEW OF OUR COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A VERY GOOD CHANGE FOR EVERY DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL BE A REMARKABLE THING TO HAVE A CALIFORNIAN ADVOCATING FOR US. A CALIFORNIA WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND HAS ALREADY WORKED ON OUR BEHALF AND CONGRESS. SHE IS A CALIFORNIAN WHO REPRESENTS THE RICHEST OF OUR DIVERSE NATION SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THE FIRST SOUTH ASIAN VICE PRESIDENT IN US HISTORY. FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE. I URGE US TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS BY FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES THROUGH OUR PRISON THAT I SAID WE COULD SUCCEED. FOCUSING ON CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE RIGHT STRATEGY THIS TIME WE WILL NOT FACE OPPOSITION AT EVERY STEP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS CARE ABOUT. THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WOMEN'S RIGHTS HEALTH CARE FAIR TREATMENT FOR IMMIGRANTS. BUT WE STILL NEED TO IDENTIFIED CALIFORNIA'S PRIORITIES AND WE WILL STILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE THOSE PRIORITIES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. PRESIDENT BIDEN OF COURSE WILL HAVE MANY MORE PEOPLE SEEKING HIS HERE BESIDE US. I'M EANWHILE INTENT TO CONTINUE LISTENING TO YOU AS WE CHART OUR COURSE. I THINK INTENDED TO CONTINUE INSURING THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBERS HAVE POWER TO PURSUE THEIR POLICY GOALS. SIX S. IN THE COMING SESSION WILL DEPEND ON THAT COLLABORATION BUT WILL ALSO TAKE A FOCUS ON SOME KEY ISSUES. ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THIS POLICE TO CERTIFICATION. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OUR DRIVE TO MAKE PUBLIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA TRULY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC KNOCKED OUT OF ANY SPECIAL INTEREST. YOU AND I DO NOT HAVE IMMUNITY FOR OUR BEHAVIOR OUR MISBEHAVIOR. IN FACT WE ARE UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY. BRITNEY IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS WHO CALIFORNIANS TRUST WITH OUR LIVES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE IMMUNITY FOR THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MISTAKES I'M TALKING ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH MISDEEDS. POLICE TO CERTIFICATION IS ABOUT PROTECTING GOOD PEOPLE FROM BAD BEHAVIOR AND WE NEED TO SEE THAT POLICY ENACTED IN THE CURRENT SESSION. CALIFORNIA ALSO MUST BUILD ON THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON CLIMATE CHANGE THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE ARE ALREADY A NATIONAL LEADER WITH AMBITIOUS PLANS TO CONDUCT CONTROLLED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND CHANGE THE MODELS FOR OUR ENERGY ECONOMY BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. I WANTED TO PUSH HARDER TO KEEP THAT PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD. THIS IS SOMETHING MADE EVEN MORE URGENT BY ANOTHER RECORD BREAKING YEAR OF WILDFIRES. THOSE FIRES PUT IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT'S TRUE WE KNOW THAT. SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD ME POINT OUT THAT IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO RELAX ON GREENHOUSE GASES CAUSED BY HUMANS. NEGLECTING THE IMPACTS VEHICLES AND FACTORIES AND ENERGY GENERATION CREATED THAT NIGHTMARES FIRE CONDITIONS WE EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR MISSION TO RAISE TEMPERATURES AND WRECKED HAVOC WITH RAINFALL TOO LITTLE HERE TOO MUCH IN HURRICANE REGIONS. MORE DISASTER IS INEVITABLE IF WE DON'T CONTROL EMISSIONS. IT MAY BE TRUE THAT WE CANNOT SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTING ALONE IN CALIFORNIA BUT DON'T FORGET CALIFORNIANS ARE LEADERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES CALIFORNIA GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATORS OF BOTH PARTIES HAVE CREATED SOLUTIONS FOR CLEAN AIR AND WATER. OTHER STATES A NATIONAL MINISTRATIONS HAVE FOLLOWED AND SO HAS INDUSTRY. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MODEL AND THAT IS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MEANS TWO THINGS FIRST IT MEANS THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS BENEFIT ALL COMMUNITIES. AND THAT WE'RE DEVOTING EQUAL ATTENTION TO POLLUTION AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS LIKE PARKS AND TRAILS AND BIKE PATHS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. SECOND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MEANS THAT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF GREEN INDUSTRY ACCRUE TO THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST. AS WE LEGISLATE TO MOVE TO A CLEANER ECONOMY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY DOES NOT GROW. CALIFORNIA CAN NOT PUT THE BRAKES ON CARBON GENERATING INDUSTRIES WITHOUT HAVING A STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA'S WORKING IN THOSE INDUSTRIES. LIKEWISE. WHY WHY DO WE NEED TO GUARANTEE THAT THE PEOPLE OF LOWER INCOME DISTRICTS LIKE MINE ARE BENEFICIARIES OF CALIFORNIANS INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO RAISE THOSE INEQUITIES BOTH IN JOBS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. I HAVE A THIRD GOAL A GOAL THAT I KNOW WE SHARED WITH OTHERS IN THIS ROOM. AND ACTIVISTS THAT'S THE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND SERVICES. OUR WORLD TODAY IS DEPENDENT ON THE INTERNET PROBABLY MORE THAN EVER DEPENDED ON TELEPHONE SERVICE. AS WE RETREATED TO OUR HOUSES TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF CARE OF THE PEOPLE BECAME DEPENDENT ON HOME ACCESS FOR EVERY FACET OF THEIR LIVES. WE SAW UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF INTERNET ACCESS WHEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO GET ONLINE INSTRUCTION. WE SAW THAT ACCESS WAS NOT UNIVERSAL WHEN PEOPLE IN WILDFIRE REGIONS WERE UNABLE TO GET EMERGENCY UPDATES THAT WERE LITERALLY MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH. THIS IS NOT JUST A QUESTION OF RICH AND POOR. ANY OF OUR RURAL CALIFORNIANS ARE UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THIS UTILITY THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT MEDICAL ACCESS AND WILDFIRE INFORMATION. CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLE HUB FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY AND YET MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS FIND THEMSELVES LEFT OUT OF BASIC INTERNET ACCESS. WE NEED TO TACKLE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND ACCESS NOW IT HAS TO HAPPEN THIS SESSION. THESE ARE ALL CALIFORNIA PRIORITIES THEY'RE THE THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE NEEDS. I'M ALSO MINDFUL OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. WE COULD TALK OVER THE BARRIER TO GETTING WORK DONE WE COULD CALL CODED AND IT'S- THE ATTENDANT. FISCAL SITUATION AS A BARRIER TO GETTING WORK DONE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT. THEY ARE SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES FOR CERTAIN BUT THEY'RE NOT GREATER THAN THE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIANS HAVE FACED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. OUR CHALLENGES INCLUDED THOSE OF NATIVE THE NATIVE AMERICANS WHO SUFFER FROM DISEASE AND MASSACRES. THEY INCLUDED THE CHALLENGES OF SOUTHEAST ASIANS WHO FLED VIOLENCE LIKE MY WIFE AND HIS FAMILY OR WORKING CLASS MEXICAN SEEKING OPPORTUNITY LIKE MY OWN FAMILY. WE HAVE BUILT. TODAY'S CALIFORNIA COLLECTIVELY BY FACING THOSE CHALLENGES. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN FACE TODAY'S CHALLENGES. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DO EVEN MORE. I WILL NOT TAKE COVIDIEN ARE UNCERTAIN REVENUE PICTURE AS AN EXCUSE TO SAY WE HAVE TO DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH FEWER RESOURCES WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE WHEN THE STATE HAS LESS THAT'S A TIME WHEN PEOPLE HURT. MOST THAT'S THE TIME WHEN WE HAVE TO DO MORE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS POSSIBLE IF WE MAKE THEM OUR PRIORITY INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM WHAT'S LEFT OVER. I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. WE THOUGHT WHEN WE PASSED ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT BUDGETS IN A DECADE EARLIER THIS YEAR. IT WAS ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS THE SPEAKER. WE MAKE SURE THAT THE BUDGET TOOK CARE OF SENIOR PROGRAMS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. LET US FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S LIFE BUT IT'S COMMON PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF ON THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THEIR SWEAT. BY SUPPORTING OUR WORKERS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR CHILDREN WE WILL REBUILD CALIFORNIA'S PROSPERITY. WITH HELP FROM OUR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT ELECT WITH HELP FROM A SUPPORT OF CONGRESS I HOPE. WITH THE COLLABORATION OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE STATE SENATE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I WENT THE HOPES OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS AS MOTIVATION WE WILL MAKE TWENTY TWENTY ONE A YEAR OF SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALING. FOR JUSTICE AND FOR BUILDING A STRONGER FUTURE. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS IS THE APPOINTMENT OF THE SPEAKER PRO TEM I AM APPOINTING KEVIN MULLIN OF THE TWENTY SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TO THIS OFFICE WE WILL ADMINISTER THE OATH AFTER WE TAKE UP OUR ORGANIZATIONAL RESOLUTIONS.
