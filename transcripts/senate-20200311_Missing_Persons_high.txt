VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING US TO ESTABLISH THIS COMMITTEE AND TO BEGIN OUR WORK IN THIS IN THIS AREA THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIR WOMAN AND TO MY COLLEAGUES- FIVE WANTED TO STOP BY BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS A IN THE FORMATION OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE- I WANT TO COMPLIMENT US EARLY CHAIRWOMAN. LG BECAUSE THIS IT TOO HAS. OF COURSE NEAR AND DEAR TO HER HEART AND ON HER CONSCIENCE FOR MANY YEARS AND I WAS TWENTY MADE REQUESTS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THIS. HER AND TO THE WHO ARE SIR ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THE CAPITAL RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE OTHERS WILL JOIN BUT TO OUR LOCAL EXPERTS IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TO SPEAKTODAY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE. AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO WELCOME I THE EXPERTS FROM TEXAS AND MY HOME STATE OF VIRGINIA WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO BE PART OF THIS PRESENTATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS. GOING RELATIONSHIP AS WE GET UNDER WAY. I HAD TO REALLY TRY TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES IN DEPTH FROM A PROFESSIONAL- LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM A HUMANE PERSPECTIVE AND- I JUST WANTED TO. BUY AND VERY QUICKLY WELCOME YOU ARE TO THIS PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS AND JUST THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A FEW MINUTES TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYONE HERE UNDERSTANDS THE COMMITMENT THAT THE SENATE IS MAKING TO THIS ISSUE AND WHEREVER IT GOES WE WANT TO STAY COMMITTED AND ENGAGED. ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN OUR SOCIETY COUNTRY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THAT EACH PERSON WHO EXISTS HAS AND LIVES WITHIN ITS BORDERS. AND OUR CONSTITUTION CODIFIED THE RIGHTS RECOGNIZED DUTY EACH PERSON. IS WITH THESE THOUGHTS THAT WE CONSIDER THE SILENT PERSONS THOSE WHO CONSTITUTE THE MISSING. AND NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. IN ADDRESSING MISSING PERSONS AND MAKE MASTICATION THE CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICER IN TRAINING POST MANUAL STARTS. BY ADVISING THAT INVESTIGATING A MISSING PERSONS CASE CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENTS. YOU'LL EVER HANDLE. AND YOUR CAREER. TO FIND THE MISSING UNHARMED AND NOT INJURED IS THE BEST ABOUT COMES FRO MISSING PERSONS WHILE HARD TO IMAGINE CARING FOR DECEASED VICTIM PROVIDING A RESTFUL. A PEACEFUL RESTING PLACE AND KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE IS OF SOME CONSOLATION TO THE VICTIMS LOVED ONES. IN THE WORST CASES THE VICTIM REMAINS MISSING AND IS NEVER LOCATED ALIVE OR DECEASED IS OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE BEST PRACTICES AND TOOLS TO ENABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LOCATE MISSING VICTIMS. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WE BEGAN TODAY'S HEARING WE MUST ENSURE AND THE KNOWLEDGE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND MAKE THEM A PART OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE USE OF RACE DATABASES TO HOLD DESCRIPTOR INFORMATION MISSING PERSON. THEY KEY FIRST STEP. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SUBMITTING MISSING PERSON INFORMATION IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THEM. SHOULD SUBMISSION OF MISSING PERSONS DESCRIPTORS AS PROVIDED AND AT LEAST EIGHT OTHER STATES BE LEGALLY MANDATED IS AN OPEN QUESTION. WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT OUR PRACTICES ARE ALWAYS INCORPORATING THE NEWEST AND MOST PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS AND THAT WE PROVIDE FOR ADVANCEMENT OF MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION FROM CORPORATE THE BENEFIT OF TIME AND TECHNOLOGY. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE THERE WERE THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR REPORTED ADULTS MISSING AND MORE THAN SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN REPORTED MISSING. THAT IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF WORK FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TAKING DOWN INFORMATION FOLLOWING UP AND MANAGING A GREAT DEAL OF DATA. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA MISSING PERSON CASES ARE NOW OLDER COLD CASES COMPLICATING THESE INVESTIGATIONS IS THE FACT THAT OFTENTIMES THE INDIVIDUAL IS ORIGINALLY FROM ONE COUNTY BUT DISAPPEARS OR THEIR BODY IS FOUND IN ANOTHER COUNTY. IN MANY CASES MULTIPLE MONIES ARE INVOLVED AND THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY IS OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL LET. THESE ISSUES PRESENT MANY CONFUSING CHALLENGES FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO ARE HESITANT TO CONTACT LAW ENFORCEMENT OR WHO ARE AND CERTAIN AS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD CALL WITH NEW INFORMATION OR POTENTIAL LEADS. IN ADDITION MANY ARE AND FAMILIAR WITH JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AT THAT SAME TIME THEY'RE COPING WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONE. TRYING TO. ALL MAY MATT. CITY IS FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND INSURANCE MATTERS THAT TRACK TODAY WE WILL HEAR FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE INITIAL REPORTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH THE VARIOUS DATABASES WERE INFORMATION IS DEPOSITED WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED TO ANALYZE THIS DATA TO LOOK FOR PATTERNS AND PROVIDE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH NEEDED ASSISTANCE. I LOOK FORWARD TO A ROBUST DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON AND I APPRECIATE OUR GUEST PANELISTS WHO HAVE AGREED TO TAKE SOME TIME TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. AND I WOULD ALSO BEFORE WE BEGAN MY TO INTRODUCE MY SHARE OF FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OUT WITHROW WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY AND SO MANY WAS PROMPTED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAD A TRAGIC CITIES OF EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN OUR DISTRICT BETWEEN NINETY FOUR AND CAN I EIGHT. TWO BILLS WHO ARE POSSIBLE NUMBER AND IF YOU GOING TO SING SOME RECOVERED I'M DECADES LATER IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND- IS. THERE HAS BEEN US INSIDE. INTO THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOK AT HOW ARE WORKING WITH FAMILIES WHO ARE THE SURVIVORS WHO ARE STILL WAITING THERE FOR POSSIBLY BRINGING THEIR LOVED ONE HOME AT SOME POINT IN TIME. BUT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE BROUGHT HOME NOW OR INTO THE FUTURE IT IS SOMETHING THAT WEIGHS ON A FAMILY AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOW THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO REMEMBER THEM AND GIVE THEM THE BEST POTENTIAL HOPE FOR A BRIEF THE RECOVERY OF THEIR LOVED ONE AT A LATER DATE. SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME UP THE FIRST PANEL. OUR FIRST PANEL OF WITNESSES CHARLES EVANS OF POST WHO WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING MANUAL FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF MISSING PERSONS. HE WILL PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE POST MANUAL SETS FORTH FOR THE RULES OF THE RESPONDING PATROL PERSON DISPATCHER AND THE DETECTIVE AS IT APPLIES TO MISSING PERSONS.

ACTED A TOPIC. SO YOU'RE GOING TO. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A CHILD I HAD A FRIEND NAMED JULIUS. OF WHO WAS NOT REPORTED MISSING IN CLEVELAND OHIO- WEEKS LATER HE WAS FOUND HANGING FROM THE RAFTERS OF AN ABANDONED ATTIC. I CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE AND TRUST.

THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING GREW OUT OF A COMPLEX SET OF ORIGINS FOLLOWING WHAT WERE TRUE. AS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS RETURN HOME FROM WAR THEY WERE CONFRONTED BY THREE MAJOR CHALLENGES. ENORMOUS UNEMPLOYMENT AS PEOPLE TRANSITION FROM A- WAR TIME TO A PEACETIME ECONOMY. LOCALIST ABILITY AS FEAR GRIPPED THE NATION REGARDING THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM AND A SYSTEMIC RACISM AS DISPARITIES REGARDING WEALTH INCOME CRIMINAL JUSTICE EMPLOYMENT HOUSING HEALTH POLITICAL POWER IN EDUCATION DISRUPTED SOCIETY.

OF THE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED PLUS MUNICIPAL COUNTY A STATE AGENCIES VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING THE POST PROGRAMS INVOLUNTARY POST PARTICIPANTS. OTHER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE POST REIMBURSE AGENT PARTICIPANT IS BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PERHAPS THEIR PENAL CODE CLASSIFICATION.

IN TERMS OF THE COURSE REQUIREMENT- THAT YOU YOU DESCRIBED IS IT TOO IT'S ONE COURSE EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT- THE DETECTIVES GET. A MORE IN DEPTH- TRAINING ON SOME OF THE SUBJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE INDIVIDUALS TO GET THE CASES TRANSFERRED TO THEM IS THAT RIGHT. WRECKED BECAUSE OF COURSE THE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED COURSE- WE HAVE MULTIPLE MODULES WITHIN OUR CREE QUE. THIS IS A LEARNING DOMAIN TWENTY SEVEN. I IT IS OF THE MATERIAL I AN OPRY TO YOU.

URBAN I DO NOT LIKE MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER COVER YOUR WOULD LIKE TO- GIVE THANKS TO CENTER GALGIANI FOR MAKING US CERTAIN THAT THIS HEARING HAPPEN AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS CREATED I STATEMENTS TO MAKE. I KIND OF WANT TO JUST ASK YOU IS LOCATED- WOMAN. WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO WATCH. TV SHOWS AND FOR SOME REASON I RECOLLECT THAT WITH AN ADULT. THAT THERE BE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD BEFORE THE AUTHORITIES WOULD TAKE ACTION ON A MISSING PERSON. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH YOUNGSTERS OR MINOR HIS ACT IS THAT. IS THAT ACCURATE OR WAS ABSOLUTELY WHAT THE WHAT NO I THINK THE FIRST PART WITH THE URBAN LEGEND OKAY AND SO THE SECOND PART IS NOT AND SO- ANYONE CAN MAKE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT AT ANY GIVEN TIME- AGAIN TO ALLOW THE SLAYER COME TO THE STATION INTO IT. BUT WITH MORE PROACTIVE WHEN THE ISSUES RELATE TO ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN THOSE CASES DEPENDING ON THE AGE OF THE KIDS THE TILES ON MENTAL ABILITY THOSE THINGS ARE HANDLED AS A PRIORITY QUE. WITHIN THE FIRST- TWO HOURS. I'M. FOR EXACT COLLECT YOU HAVE TO ENTER THAT INFORMATION INTO CLASS WITHIN THE FIRST FOUR HOURS. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT- TRACKING SYSTEMS WHICH- PROBABLY DOJ CAN ASK MORE SPECIFICALLY. IT REQUIRES TO RESPOND TO THOSE MISSING PERSON INVESTIGATION ON A PRIORITY BASIS. ARTS OF BUT IN TERMS OF THE PATHOLOGY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE. IS THE TRAINING THAT TO INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED RIPOSTE. DIFFERENT FOR MISSING ADULTS VERSES MISSING MINERS. YES AND SO THERE IS THAT THERE IS A CHECKLIST THIS IS THE THIS GIVEN TO EACH EDGE THE TRUCK JOURNAL PATROL OFFICER. AND SO IT MAKES A SIMPLE THIS WAY THEY DON'T UNINTENTIONALLY MYTH ANY STEP THAT IS THE REALLY A- THREE. STEP OF THE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO Và AND SO THEY GET THAT. AND SO ON. YES WE HAVE TO GIVE IT A DIFFERENCE. TO JUVENILES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THERE VULNERABLE AND INNOCENT I KNOW WE'LL GET A NUMBER THAT A MORE DETAIL AS- CORE SERVICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK FOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANTED THANK GOD LAW IF YOU ARE GOING TO TEST BEFORE US THIS IS. GREAT IMPORTANT. AND YOUR STORY OF. YOUR YOUTH IS. REALLY HARBOR AND DIE IN SOME FOR THE DOING THIS ON PARTY FOR ME TO WANTED PART OF AND EIGHTEEN I A- OF A CONCERT AFFRONT ALSO HER FOR HER HIS LIP OF THE LITTLE BOY MISSING FIVE EURO. AND HE FOUND OUT DATA WELL SO IT'S- IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT BECOMES A PERSONAL MODELED MATTER TO YOU AS WELL. BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT WITH MISTER BURGESS SAID I'VE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVEN WITHIN MY CONSTITUENCY A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. AND THEY WOULD CALL ME ARE WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE TEENAGER WAS GONE NOT NECESSARILY ADULTS BUT THEIR TEENAGER OR WAS EIGHTEEN AND I'VE HEARD THAT OFTEN TO LIKE. YOU KNOW LET'S WAIT TO SEE HE'S NOT A RUNAWAY AND SAT. FALLS OR DO THE SORT OF THAT THE CASES AND THEN DECIDE THAT. YOU KNOW I MEAN BASED ON THE HISTORY THE CHILD BUT I'VE HEARD THAT CAN EVEN MY CAN IT'S NOT THAT ARE OUT TO WAIT THE. COME THE NEXT MORE IN OUR LATE NIGHT I DON'T KNOW. FOR THE I THINK EACH THE- IS OF HIS BIG. ALSO I THINK A LOT. EVERY LAW FOR. A HAS THE- REGIONAL IDENTITY. AND SO THEY MAY CHOOSE TO X. HOW THE- OF. I WAS A CAP WITH THE PT. AS OF THAT DEFINITELY WOULDN'T. RUN THE IT WOULD WORK FOR US. AND SO. IN DIFFERENT JURY. YOUNG WITH. THERE IS THE WAY THEY WE SHOULD DO THINGS AND THE WAY THAT WE AT. DO THE- AND AREA DEPARTMENT HAS A PARTNERS A- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AGENCY. THEIR FOCUS ON. CRIMES THE- IN ORDER HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. DOES THE IT THE INVESTIGATION MISSING PART. FALL FROM THE PRIOR OF YOUR CAR THAT CASE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE PRIOR IN IT AND URBAN OR A ROOM DEPARTMENT. THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PRIOR IS A- AND EVERY PART OF. HAS A. AND SO THE KIDS IS THAT. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM'S THAT CAN OF MENTIONED NEMETH. AND. SEE I SEE. OUR CAT UNIT BECAUSE THIS ARE IN PLAY. WE NOW HAVE TRANCE DISCIPLINARY KIND IT INNER IN AGE. NETWORK SO IT'S TO DIFFERENT IS NOT LOOK. LOCATED OR ISOLATE. IN A PARTICULAR AGE SILO. IF IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SO. VIEW TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU THAT. REALLY APPRECIATE. OF WHAT IS IDENTIFIED AS THE MISSING IN SOME OF OUR JUVENILE HOMES THE HOME OPERATIVES MAY I IMMEDIATELY PUT OUT A MISSING PERSON BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD IN. A CONFLICT A PERSONALITY CONFLICT AND SO- DOES LOCATION BECOME BECOME LIKE REPEAT COLOCATION. AS THE WE IDENTIFY IF IN FACT WE GET THREE P. COST MOST AND LOCATIONS- BUT WHEN A CALL FIRST COMES IN IT MAY NOT GO TO THE OFFICER IN FACT IT'LL PROBABLY BE A TELEPHONIC. INTO A DISPATCH CENTER AND ALL OF OUR DISPATCHERS ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE SAME COURSE ALSO. BUILT DEL ASSESS THE SITUATION AND THEY'LL THE DOLLAR SIGN AT THE CALL IS A SIGN IMMEDIATELY. YOU KNOW ITS DEPEND UPON WHAT WE'RE THAT CALL FALLS IN THE QUEUE. OF THE OFFICERS RADIO CALLS THEY SHOULD BE RESPOND TO THAT. SOONER THAN LATER. AND SO GOES FROM THE FOR THE REPORTING PARTY TO THE DISPATCHER. TO THE POLICE OFFICER NOW DISPATCHERS A CRUCIAL PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS. BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW TO NAVIGATE THE AMBIGUITY OF THE EMOTIONALISM OF THE CALLER- AND THE SOMETIMES THE CALL IS A PLAN F. BECAUSE THEY- THEY JUST WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO STOP BY THE POLICE. AND SO THE DEBATE DISPATCHES ARE KEY THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE A FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST. YOU KNOW DEPEND UPON HOW LONG BEFORE THE JOB THE X. BECOME VERY VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING. GETTING TO THE CORE ELEMENTS AND THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL. AND THEN THAT DISPATCHER HE OR SHE WILL THEN SEND THE CALL OUT FOR PARTICULAR DEPUTY. OR A POLICE OFFER YOU PLEASE ALSO UNIT. AND THEY'LL GET THE ITEM ON THE CHECKLIST THAT WE PROVIDED BILL CALLED. THE DISPATCHERS ACTUALLY HAVE THAT ALSO. AND SO NOT ONLY TO THE FIELD OFFICES HAVE THAT CHECKLIST. THE DISPATCHERS HAVE A CHECKLIST ALSO. AND SO. WHEN THE OFFICERS RESPOND TO THE TO THE LOCATION THEN THEY'LL WHAT THEY'LL PROBABLY GET. MOM THE MORE SOME OF SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THE- THE NUANCES OF THE BACKSTORY OF THE REPORT IS. YOU KNOW I LIKE THIS THAT I LOOK AT TAKE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT. AS BEING PART OF A COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS AND YOUR ON COMPLEXITY- I CALLED. BECAUSE MANY THINGS ARE INVOLVED IN TAKING A MISSING PERSONS REPORT FOR THE COMPLEX. DATA BECAUSE OF MANY THINGS REPORTER WITH. THE THERE CHIU. AND THOSE ME THINGS ALL. CHANGING IN THAT COULD TO OTHER. SO OFF HAVE TO. POST ON THEM AND- LATEST TO COME. AGREE WITH. TODAY YOU CAN NOW CALL GIRL COMES THE RESEARCH ON IT AND TO THE BATCH TO THEN PUTS IT AND THE OFFICER Q. HOW DO THAT WORK ANY WALK US THROUGH AT A TIME LINE SUGGEST WITH TIME IS THAT SO THAT IN THE GUIDELINE FOR THE WITH THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE ANY ARE TIME REQUIRE FOR THE TO GOOD OF MR PERSONS OF. AND THE ISSUE IS IT IF THE JUVENILE YESTERDAY TO GET ON THAT RIGHT AWAY- IF THEY'RE A IF IT'S MORE GENERAL. THE INFORMATION AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY GONNA START LOOKING FOR THAT PERSON. BUT DEPENDING ON THE AGENCY. BECAUSE DIFFERENT AGENCIES HAVE THE PREROGATIVE. TO HAVE PUT DIFFERENT TIME LINES ON THAT INVESTIGATION. FOR YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT QUESTION WITH POST BECAUSE POST AS PRIMARILY A THINK TANK. AND SO WHAT WE DO WE BRING IN THE VARIOUS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. AND THIS THE EXPERTS WHO BRING AND THE- THE IDEAS IN THE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD START FOCUSING MORE ATTENTION AND FOR THAT BECAUSE- I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK. AT DEVELOPING A CALL AGREED A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP REGARDING ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE A FOR INSURGENCY OLOGY ENTITIES SUCH AS- C. R. I. GENETICS OR TWENTY THREE IN ME OR AND ANCESTRY .COM. FAMILY IN OR FOR ME. ENTITIES THE PRODUCTS. CUT IN OUR REALLY. IT'S I'M I'M HAPPY THAT MAJORITY PEOPLE CALL MISSARE NOT. REALLY HARM OF THEM A RETURN. BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT DOESN'T BURDEN THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF POST. AND SO I SUGGEST THAT- POST AS A THINK TANK A RESEARCH AGENCY. DEVELOP A PROTOCOL OF- JUSTICE FOR MISSING PERSONS AND MAYBE WE CAN DEVELOP DEVELOP A MISSING PERSONS COLLABORATORY. BETWEEN THE AGENCIES. AND I SUGGEST THAT WE ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT OF HELPING GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENTITIES THAT HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. THE RAND CORPORATION WERE THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION OR HUDSON INSTITUTE THE COUNCIL FORMULATIONS OF THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER BROOKINGS INSTITUTE AND EVEN DARPA. BECAUSE DARK- DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ADVANCED WEAPONS I UNDERSTAND THAT. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MILITARIZE OFFERS A BY THE WAY. IT'S BUT HE IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT WE SHOULD AVAIL OURSELVES TO. SO IF THEY'RE ABLE TO HAVE- ON A SYSTEM. THEY COULD LOCATE A DAY I DID. DISEASE SEN UNDER THE GROUND IS JUST SO THEY CAN BE LIKE TRYING TO FLEE. IN LA P. WE HAVE A HUGE. ASTRAL DIVISION HEALTH. AND WE CAN DELIVER THE TRAY. HE PATTERN PATH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING WITHOUT THE PURSE. IS IT POSSIBLE WITH ADVANCED THAT ARE ARE- PARTNERS HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WE'RE IN WE CAN LEVERAGE SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED OVER TIME. WILL IT BE GREAT IF THE ABILITY TO LOAD UP LOCATED DECEASED PERSON UNDERGROUND WAS LIMITED TO THE K. NINE. WHICH YOU CAN DO IT ELECTRONICALLY. WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT. YOU KNOW AND SO DIDN'T AS WE BEGIN TO TAKE A LOOK THINGS LIKE EPIGENETICS MAYBE THEY COULD EVEN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ALSO. KNOWING THAT THE BIOLOGICAL MAKE UP OF A PERSON UNDERGROUND- CAN BE PICKED UP. TECHNOLOGY HAS MANY OPPORTUNITIES OPPOSE MANY THREATS BUT IT HAS MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LEVERAGE IN REAL TIME. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS HERE AND I WAS GOING TO BE MY NEXT QUESTION AS AS TO- AT WHAT POINT AND HOW IS IT THAT. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO POST AND HOW THAT HOW WOULD THAT BE INCORPORATED WHAT WOULD THAT PROCESS. LOOK LIKE. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS AS WELL THAT ARE ARE WELL YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN. WE RECEIVE MOST OF OUR- INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE OR GREATER ALL THE GREAT IDEAS COME FROM THE OFFICERS IN THE FIELD PROBABLY EVER DOES COME FROM COMMAND WE TAKE CREDIT BUT ALL THOSE GREAT IDEAS COME FROM FROM THEM SO WE AUDIT EVERY EVERY. TWO PERSONS CLASS IS THE IS THE OBJECT OF AN AUDIT WE HONOR THE VALUE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE INSTRUCTOR DELIVERY. IN TERMS ARE THEY MAINTAIN THE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE- EXPAND COURSE OUTLINE. ARE THEY HITTING ALL OF THE TOPICS THIS EXTREME PUT TOGETHER BY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHOEVER A PULSE- WE'LL WE ALL OF THE CURRICULUM. FOR RELEVANCY FOR CURRENCY I WE MAKE A DAT ADAPT HAITIANS AS NECESSARY AND TYPICALLY THE ADAPTATIONS THAT WE MAKE A VERY AGILE. AND SO WE WILL WE WILL MAKE THOSE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY- WE CAN UPDATE APPROVED- ACRYLAMIDE EDUCATION IN TERMS OF ADDING THINGS WITHIN AN HOUR. GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. YEAH WE HAVE A REGIONAL CONSULTANTS THAT ARE VERY GOOD TO HAVE CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. SO BOTH- HAS A HIGHLY NETWORKED RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. ON THE LOCAL. STATE NATIONAL. AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL BASIS- YOU YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT- POST FREQUENTLY WE ENTERTAIN ENTERTAIN- DIGNITARIES FROM OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE FAR EXCEEDS. OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR CURRICULUM. AND IT'S TRUE AND IS TRUE IT'S TRUE AND SO WE'RE VERY PROACTIVE IN THAT AREA- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALSO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY USED WHEN GET VESTED GATE MISSING PERSON I TALK ABOUT- INTO A AS THE ICY. NAME IS A CLASS- WHICH IMAGE YOU HAVE THE INTERNET INFORMATION WITHIN FOUR HOURS- I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE MORE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE. WE CAN ELIMINATE SOME OF THE OLD SCHOOL THINGS LIKE DOOR KNOCKING BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ALSO BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SURVEILLING CERTAIN FOLKS- GPS TRACKING DEVICES LISTENING DEVICES HIDDEN MINIATURE CAMERAS A COVERT BRADY BODY CALMEST ASH CAN. MAYBE BUT BRIDGE A BRUSH CAMERA. MILLET IMAGERY SURVEYS TAKE. FLAT APT OPTICAL LIKE DETECTION- KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY I MEAN TO IT THERE'S A FULL SPECTRUM. OF THINGS THAT WE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IF WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT. AND SO OUR OBJECTIVE IS ALWAYS ENSURE THAT OUR INSTRUCTORS ARE NEVER TEACHING FROM OF A SILO PERSPECTIVE. WE ALWAYS WANTED TO INTERACT. BECAUSE OF THAT INFORMATION COMES. OUTSIDE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU BELIEVE COULD BE USED TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AGAIN PLEASE YEAH THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOR YEARS THE MILITARY'S ACTUALLY BEEN INSERTING- BIO INFORMATION SHIPS IN SOLDIERS. IN THE EVENT THAT THEY GET SEPARATED YOU KNOW AND SO- AND THERE IS A LOT NOW TO REALLY DRILL DOWN TO FIND OUT THE NUANCES OF THEIR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO DEVELOP A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED- IS THAT MANY OF OUR MILITARY ALL THE FIVE BRANCHES NOW SIX WITH THE- THE SPACE BRANCH- MANY OF OUR BRANCHES OF THE FIVE BRANCHES AT LEAST. THEY'RE VERY A SECRETIVE ABOUT THEIR TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE HAVE TO BE MORE FOR PROACTIVE IN DEVELOPING A SHARE RESPONSIBILITY WITH AND WE MUST HAVE TO LOBBY AND LIKE MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS LOBBY YOU AS A WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO WITH A NO. AND SO I THINK THAT ARE THERE'S MUCH THAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE WE HAVE INFORMATION WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT. THANK YOU. NOW THE QUESTION. THIS I'M SORRY IN THE QUESTIONS ARE JUST MORE CURIOSITY I MEAN I KNOW IT HAPPENS BUT IT CAN YOU SHARE WHAT CRITERIA HAS TO BE MET BEFORE LIKE A LOCAL AGENCY TRANSFERS A CASE TO THE FBI MATHIS HIM AT SOME POINT THE POLICE HANDLES IT UNTIL THEY CAN NO LONGER SO HOW DOES A TRANSFER HAPPENED A CALL TO THE FBI HOW DO THEY GET INVOLVED I WOULD THINK THAT IF THERE'S AN INTERSTATE JURISDICTION HELLO THIS TO YOU HAVE A- YOU HAVE A- I DON'T HAVE FILE. LETTER FOLLOWS KNOWN IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN THE INFORMATION GOES IN THE NAME IS WORTH THE ICY WE ACTUALLY OF ABILITY NOW TO HAVE A NETWORKED INFORMATION SYSTEM WHERE WE COULD PICK UP THAT INFORMATION FROM OTHERS SO. IF THE QUESTION IS WHEN DOES THE CASE BECOME A COURT CASE. AND SO. WE HAVE THE CASE UP TO THE POINT THAT THERE ARE NO NO FURTHER LEADS. NOW YOU HAVE TO TALK TO EXPECTED AGENCY TO DETERMINE WHAT OTHER RAT WHAT ARE THE LOCAL. ARE REQUIREMENTS PROCEDURES POLICIES PROCEDURES REGARDING WHEN THE CASE GOES COAL. HOW LONG DO YOU ALLOW THAT TO BE IN A POSITION IN TYPICALLY STAYS THERE. UNTIL SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. A COMES IN WE HAD THAT WITH OUR- WAS THAT THE STRANGLER HERE. I IN IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GETTING THIS NAME. BUT OF. THE TRANSFER IS NEVER REALLY TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER AGENCY. IT'S USUALLY A SITUATION WE COLLABORATE WITH ANOTHER AGENCY IF THERE IS A HIT. AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE A NEED ACT ACTUALLY OPEN A CO CASE. SO WHAT'S CONSIDERED A COLD CASE IN TERMS OF TIMELINE HAS AND THAT'S THE THIS QUESTION IS SO EACH DEPARTMENT WOULD DETERMINE THAT PROCESS AND HAVE A- DETERMINATION FOR WHAT A CO CASES. YOU KNOW SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE HOUSE RIGHT HILLSIDE STRANGLER CASE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE DECADES AGO ALMOST A DECADE AGO BUT THE KEY IS THAT IT TOOK SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO THE KEY REMAIN COOL SO HOW LONG IS. A CASE A NOW PUT ON A BURKE ON ON SITE ON THE SIDE BURNER. IT'S A LOCAL DETERMINATION SENATE FIRING SHARE I IT WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A COLD CASE MAYBE I'M I MISUNDERSTOOD AT TIMES WERE THE FBI COME SOONER TO TRY AND HELP EXPEDITE LIKE FINDING A MISSING CHILD OR AT NINE ASSIST WE HAVE TO REQUEST THAT ALL YOU HAVE AGENCY HAS TO TRIGGER THAT REQUEST. AND THERE IS NO STANDARDIZATION FOR WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW AND SALAS JUST COMES OUT TO A PERSON I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW AND SO THAT THERE THERE IS NO POST MANDATE OR STANDARD. THAT REQUIRES YOU CONTACT AN OUTSIDE AGENCY. OR HOMICIDE INVESTIGATOR INVESTIGATORS OF MISSING PERSONS- ARE ARE TYPICALLY VERY FOCUS. THE RE PASSION ABOUT RESOLVING EVERY CASE. BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER EVERY INVESTIGATOR HAS A PRIOR CASES ON THAT THEY MUST HANDLE IN THE- I'M NOT ERTAIN WHAT THE TIPPING POINT IS. FOR WHEN A CASE GOALS. COLE HAS TO MY LAST QUESTION IF I MAY I'M NOT SURE WHO CREATED A REPORT THAT I READ THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME. BUT IT STATES THAT CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER WERE THIRTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR REPORTED ADULTS MISSING AND SEVEN NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CHILDREN IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE. THE OUTCOME OF HOW MANY WERE RECOVERED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION AS OPPOSED LIKE YOU KNOW HOW MANY RECOVERED HOW MANY. WHEN COLD WE HAVE ANY DATA ON I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON CALIFORNIA HER THIS YEAR MENTION THAT NUMBER. I DON'T I'M NOT AWARE THAT WHEN- BUT I THINK SOMEBODY IS LOOKING INTO THAT SOME OF OUR SUCH ABOUT EXPERTS BIKE HERE MIGHT BE AWARE THAT. OKAY I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. AND I WOULD ADD THAT I HAD A WONDERFUL MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EARLIER IN THE WEEK AND WE SPOKE TO THAT MATTER SO. PERHAPS THEY CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION- WHEN THEY'RE UP HERE ON THE PANEL AND THEIR FAMILIES I THINK THAT HAD BEEN THERE WILL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE ON YOURS ACOSTA PDF OFF THE CHART. VICE IN LOS ANGELES AND I GET. ALL IT WILL HOLD. A. SO MY PARTNER I GO. AND WHEN THE KIDS WAS JUST KINDA. YOU KNOW NERVE. SAYING I GOTTA GO TO THE RESTROOM AMOUNTS TO NOW THAT JUST STAY HERE. AS SHE SAID GO AHEAD. AND SOUL. FOR WILL. TO HAVE. I DON'T THINK IT TO WISHLIST BY MANNA FROM HEAVEN AT. INTO IS JUST. COLLECTED BEHAVE COM EXPERIENCE OVER TIME. YOU HAVE MORE TO REFER TO. SO MY INTUITION LET ME TO LEAN OUT THE- DEPARTMENT AND LOOKED DOWN THE HALL. AND I SAW THIS GAUNTLET. OF A MALES TYPICALLY THE MILK PARA FALLS IN LA COUNTY JAIL RELEASED. THE GET VOUCHERS TO STAY IN A HOTEL. NOW THE HOTELS A TARGET RICH AREAS FOR. CHILDREN TO BE. EXPLOITED BY PETA FILES. SO I LOOKED DOWN I SAW THE KID DISAPPEAR. LIKE BY MINISTER TO THE SECOND BECAUSE WITH MY PARTNER SECONDLY MY PARTNER. AND BUT- THE REASON THE KID. WAS GETTING STOP IS BECAUSE THE THE RESTAURANT ALL THE BATHROOMS AND SHOWERS IN THE HOTELS ARE AT THE END OF THE HALL. SO YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE END OF THE HALL AND THE KIND OF THE BEEN THERE. SO I WASN'T THERE FOR THAT REASON I HAD TO STAY WITH MY PARTNER AND I COULD INVESTIGATE THAT. FIVE YEARS LATER. I'M IN CHARGE OF VICE- IN DOWNTOWN ONE OF MY GUYS BRINGS. IN A YOUNG PERSON. WITH A PROSTITUTE. TURNS OUT THAT PERSON WAS ONE OF THE KIDS WHO LIVE IN A HOTEL AND I WANTED TO MYSELF IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I COULD HAVE DONE. FIVE YEARS EARLIER. THE COULD PREVENT IT THAT OUTCOME A BEEN A REST AS A PROSTITUTE FIVE YEARS LATER. SO WHEN WE LOOK INTO OUR SYSTEM- NEMETH AND IS THE ICY IT CAME OF THAT PERSON WAS A MISSING PERSON. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING. I THINK THE CHANCES ARE GREAT. AS A WE TAKE A LOOK AT A LOT OF A LOT OF OUR HOMES COMMUNITY. HOW MANY PERSONS ARE ACTUALLY MISSING. PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM THAT'S WHY I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE- IS NOT EMERGENT IS HERE NOW. AND SO I THINK WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IS THE FUTURE NOW. THIS ORDER WHAT ARE THE- WHAT ARE THE PROBLEM SOLVING SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE NOW. WE HAVE AT OUR FINGERTIPS. THERE WE CAN LEVERAGE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF SAVING. THOSE POTENTIAL MISSING PEOPLE. FROM BECOMING PERMANENTLY MISSING. YES. YOU'RE GOING DOWN WHERE I WAS HOPING TO. DO YOU HAVE ANY LEGAL THIS POST HAVE ANY LEGAL OR POLITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT YOU'D BE WILLING TO SHARE. I SPENT ENOUGH TIME IN POLITICS BOTH LOCAL AND HERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A SEAMLESS. INTER OPERABILITY IN GOVERNMENT IT'S HUMAN INSTITUTION AND ALWAYS DO IS LOOK BACK AT NINE ELEVEN TO SEE HOW THE WRITING AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE LEFT HAND WAS DOING AND VICE VERSA- U. P. TALKED ABOUT SEEING PATTERNS. DO YOU HAVE ANY LEGAL OR POLITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS OR HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS INSTITUTIONAL OR SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT DEAL WITH LIMITATIONS ON PROFILING WAR WHETHER PROFILING CAN BE HELPFUL- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PATTERNS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAYBE HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED PRIOR FOR HAVING GAUGED CERTAIN MISS BEHAVIORS THAT ARE UNLIKELY TO- BE RESOLVED. SO KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT- DO YOU HAVE ANY POLITICAL LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL. AND IN DEALING WITH MISSING PERSONS. AS A SENIOR YOU KNOW POSTED IN A POLITICAL OUR ORGANIZATION SO WERE PROHIBITED FROM GIVING THOSE KINDS OF RESPONSES. BUT BUT SERVICE TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I IN A YOU KNOW WE HAVE A- BUT THE ANSWER IS YES- BUT I DON'T COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I WANTED TO TROUBLE. OKAY BREAKING THE LAW I HAVE. AND THAT BRINGS US TO. THE MISSING PERSON DATABASES- NCIC VIE CAP NAME AS- IT'S RATHER CONFUSING- FOR A FAMILY MEMBER IN PARTICULAR AND I KNOW THAT IN MY DISTRICT I'VE HAD. A NUMBER OF CALLS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS HIS LEFT LENDS WENT MISSING AND THEY'RE- THEY'RE HOPING THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBER IS THAT THAT THE STATE'S DOJ WEBSITE. MAYBE THEY ARE AND ARE DISCOVERING THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS NOT LISTED IN NAME S. NCIC IS PRIVATE. SO THE QUESTION TO YOU IS. DOES POST. CONCERN ITSELF WITH. WITHIN THE PROVIDING GUIDELINES OF HOW AND WHEN A MISSING INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO EACH OF THE DIFFERENT DATABASES. AT THIS IN EXPECT EXPECT COURSE ALLEN THAT GIVE YOU AND IF I CAN LEAVE THAT ANSWER TO ONE OF THE PRACTITIONERS I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN FINALLY THE DISPOSE CONSIDER ITSELF WITH WITH HOW TO HANDLE AS- A CHILD CASE AS OPPOSED TO AN ELDERLY PERSON'S CASE PERHAPS SOMEONE WHO HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I KNOW THAT I DID LEGISLATION IN THE PAST THAT. THAT REQUIRED A HIGHER LEVEL OF ATTENTION FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I THINK OF IT I THINK- THAT THE TRIAL AND THE ELDERLY ADULT WHO'S HAVING- COGNITIVE CHALLENGES. THE PART OF THIS THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THING GOING. I THOUGHT IT HAS TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY RESPONSE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND YES THEY WERE THERE'S A PROTOCOL FOR THEM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT. THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT PROTOCOL IS INCLUDED IN THE POST CREDITS IN THE CURRICULUM. YES IT ALSO INCLUDED A BROKEN I GAVE YOU- THAT JUST A ON THE DVD REGARDING THE ORIENTATION OPPOSE I GAVE YOU ONE HAVE TO DO WITH ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ALSO PUT ONE IN THERE. ON THE CURRICULUM ITSELF THAT WE HAVE IN A DE. TWENTY SEVEN. THE CURRICULUM IS THERE. ALSO PUT IN. THE CURRICULUM FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THE COURSE THAT THEY TEACH. THE SO I THINK YOU FOR. ARE YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH YOU'RE YOUR PRESENTATION WAS EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE. REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOU TAKING YOUR TIME AND ENERGY TO WALK THROUGH RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MOST WELCOME THANK YOU. OUR SECOND WITNESS TODAY'S DEPUTY SHERIFF ALYSSA CAROL WITH THE MAC MARIPOSA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. DEPUTY CAROL HAS BEEN WITH THE MARIPOSA DEPARTMENT FOR THREE YEARS AND HAS A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE WITH MISSING PERSONS CASES AND WE HAVE HOPE TO GET A CLEAR VIEW OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS FROM A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE. WHEN AN OFFICER ENCOUNTERS IN MISSING PERSONS REQUEST AGAIN WITH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU ADDRESS A FEW THINGS FOR STARTERS IN YOUR PRESENTATION. NUMBER ONE TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY BASED ON YOUR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE NORMAL PROCESS FOR A MISSING PERSONS CALL STARTING WITH THE COMPLAINT OR THE OR THE ADVISORY THAT COMES IN AND THEN IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT IS THE NORMAL RESPONSE TIME TO ANSWERING A MISSING PERSONS CALL. AND THEN FINALLY HOW DOES% RESPONDING OFFICER IN TERMS OF SEEN ASSESSMENT INFORMATION TAKEN AND DESCRIPTORS OF THE MISSING VICTIM HANDLE AND MISSING PERSONS COMPLAINT CALL IF YOU COULD TAKE US THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR SO AGAIN NAMES ALYSSA CAROL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE IT IS VERY MUCH A- A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE SO THANK YOU. AND THE WAY THAT I'VE LAID OUT MY PRESENTATION TO YOU DOES COVER ALL OF THOSE POINTS- THE ONE THAT I WILL MAKE SURE TO ADDRESS IS THE NORMAL RESPONSE TIME. AND BUT I'LL HAVE TO FIND A GOOD SPOT TO STOP WITHIN MY- PREPARED SPEECH TODAY TO DISCUSS THAT THANK YOU OF COURSE- SO I AM A DEPUTY SHERIFF WITH AMERICA'S A COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. MARIPOSA COUNTY IS THE HOME OF YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK. I STARTED MY CAREER BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS A COMMUNICATIONS DISPATCHER I SPENT TWO YEARS WITH THE MADERA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AS A DISPATCHER. AND IN RETURN MARIPOSA COUNTY WHERE I BECAME A DEPUTY SHERIFF AFTER COMPLETING THE POST BASIC POLICE ACADEMY. I'M CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND I'M ALSO ONE OF THE DEPUTIES SEARCH AND RESCUE COORDINATORS FOR MY AGENCY. I'M GOING BACK TO THE WAITING PERIOD QUESTION. WE OFTEN HEAR THAT THERE IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR WAITING PERIOD IN TV SHOWS ARE IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE URBAN LEGEND AS WELL BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY- LAWS. STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS THAT PROHIBIT AGENCIES FROM HOLDING SUCH A TIME PERIOD- TO BE OBSERVED HELLO WE CANNOT REFUSE A MISSING PERSON CASE BASED ON. HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN MISSING THEY COULD BE MISSING. TECHNICALLY I GUESS MINUTES AND WE STILL HAVE TO DO SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION INTO THOSE CASES- I ALSO WANT TO START OFF BY HIGHLIGHTING PENAL CODE ONE FOUR TWO ONE ONE PARENTHESES HEY. STATES ALL LOCAL POLICE AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS SHALL ACCEPT ANY MISSING PERSON REPORT. REGARDLESS OF JURISDICTION SO THE REPORT MUST BE TAKEN THEN FORWARDED TO THE APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION. OF WHERE THE MISSING PERSON RESIDES OR THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE LAST SEEN. SO THIS MEANS- MYSELF AS A AS A SHERIFF DEPUTY SHERIFF IN MARIPOSA COUNTY. WE COULD RECEIVE A CALL FROM SOMEBODY LIVING DOWN SOUTH AND- IN SAN DIEGO. A REPORTING SOMEBODY MISSING OUT OF. HUMBOLDT AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT CASE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE. THAT CASE NEEDS TO BE FORWARDED TO SO WE- WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TURN ANYBODY DOWN REGARDING A MISSING PERSON. SO THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER ACTUALLY MEET LET ME BACK UP THERE AS FAR AS PRIORITIZING MISSING PERSON CASES IN OUR CUES AND MY AGENTS YOURS FIRST YOU ARE OUR CALL THE RESPOND TO US CALLS FOR SERVICE AND MISSING PERSON CASES ARE PRIORITIZE OVERALL PROPERTY CASES- MEANING WE WOULD GO TO A MISSING PERSON CASE OVER A BURGLARY OR THEFT OF SOME SORT BUT- THAT BEING SAID WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY PRIORITIZE A MISSING PERSON CASE OVER A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A THREAT TO LIFE. IN EARLY HAPPENING SO IF IT'S- IF IT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING OR SOMEBODY'S LIFE OR WELL BEING IS IN DANGER WE WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT BEFORE A MISSING PERSON INVESTIGATION IF THAT MAKES SENSE. SO THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS UNDER WHICH SOMEONE CAN GO MISSING BUT THERE ARE ONLY NINE CATEGORIES UNDER WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT. CAN ENTER THOSE CASES INTO THE MISSING AND THAT UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SYSTEM WHICH OLIVER TO AS MAPS OR THEM UPS. THE FIRST WILL ADDRESSES THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF MISSING PERSON CASE THAT MY AGENCY SEES WHICH IS RUN AWAY JUVENILES. THIS IS DEFINED AS MISSING JUVENILES REPORTED AS A RUN AWAY. SO THE DISPATCHER RECEIVES. OF THE CALL FOR SERVICE ASSIGNED AS A DEPUTY TO THAT CALL. THE DEPUTY CONTACT THE REPORTING PARTY IN PERSON OR BY PHONE DEPENDING ON THAT PERSON'S LOCATION. THE DEPUTIES RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TO OBTAIN THE JUVENILES ALFA INFORMATION AND BY THAT I MEAN THE NAME DATE OF BIRTH PHYSICAL DESCRIPTORS. DESCRIPTION THINGS OF THAT SORT- WILL BROADCAST A BILL WELL WHICH IS A BE ON THE OOK OUT ON OUR RADIO. THE PURPOSE OF THIS. IS TO LET HER PARTNERS ON THE CHEF KNOW THAT THE JUVENILE HAS RUN AWAY AND NEEDS TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR PARENT OR GUARDIAN. THIS ALSO GIVES THAT INVESTIGATING DEPUTY IT AT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT WITH THAT REPORTING PARTY AND GET FURTHER INFORMATION FOR THE FURTHER DETAILED INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO. MAYBE WHERE THAT JUVENILES KNOWN TO HANG OUT OR- MAYBE IT FIND OUT IF THEY ARE HAVE VISUAL RUN AWAY WHICH WE OFTEN SEE AS WELL. AND ALSO PENAL CODE ONE FOUR TWO ONE ONE. AND THE SEAS D. LIKE DAVID REQUIRES THAT THE BILL WILL BE BROADCAST SO THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL. SATURDAY AT WILL SUBMIT THE MISSING PERSON REPORTING FORM TO DISPATCH TO ENTER THAT INTO MAPS. PENAL CODE ONE FOUR TWO ONE ONE PARENTHESES HE REQUIRES THE ENTRY OF THAT INTO MAPS BE DONE WITHIN TWO HOURS REGARDING A JUVENILE. AND AS FAR AS OUR INVESTIGATION GOES WILL ATTEMPT CONTACT WITH THE MISSING PERSON WE SOMETIMES SEE THAT SOME JUVENILES DON'T WANT TO BE FOUND BY THEIR PARENT OR GUARDIAN BUT THEY'RE SOMETIMES WILLING TO TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR AN OUTSIDE PERSON AND THEY JUST MIGHT NEED SOME TIME TO CALM DOWN AND CONSIDER COMING BACK HOME SO WILL ATTEMPT CONTACT PERSONALLY. SO IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING. I CAST MYSELF WITH FOLLOWING UP ON THE STILL OUTSTANDING MISSING PERSONS REPORTED TO MY AGENCY. I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE AND CLEAR ALMOST TEN RUN AWAY JUVENILES FROM OUR OUR CASE OR CASES. THAT FOLLOW A PROCESS STARTED WITH THE GROUP HOMES WHERE THE RUNAWAYS HAD BEEN LIVING THE ADMINISTRATORS PROVIDED ME WITH CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE JUVENILES. SOCIAL WORKERS AND OR OR PROBATION OFFICERS. THE SOCIAL WORKERS WERE THEN ABLE TO TELL ME ABOUT THE CURRENT LOCATIONS OF THE JUVENILES. THEN WE HAD THOSE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MAKE PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE JUVENILES AND WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAR THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM. WHEN IT CAME TO THE JUVENILES WHO WERE ON PROBATION UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THEM WERE IN CUSTODY IN JUVENILE HALL. AND THEY'D BEEN ARRESTED AFTER MY AGENCY ENTER THEM INTO THE MAPS. UPON SPEAKING TO JUVENILE HALL STAFF AND THIS IS ACROSS FOR DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN THIS STATE. THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT THE JUVENILES WERE. WERE IN THE MAPS AND THEY EITHER DID NOT KNOW HOW OR THEY DID NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO CLEAR THE MISSING PERSON ENTRY. I REACHED OUT TO SURROUNDING COUNTIES JUVENILE HALLS- CLOSE TO MY AREA TO INQUIRE ABOUT THEIR PROTOCOL OF BOOKING A MINOR. MOST OF THESE AGENCIES DID NOT READ THE MINOR'S INFORMATION THROUGH CLASS. WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM- THEY ONLY FINGERPRINT THEM TO CONFIRM IN DOCUMENT WHO THEY HAVE IN THEIR CUSTODY. PROTOCOL FOR BOOKING AN ADULT- JUST TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF THIS. IS IT INCLUDES FINGERPRINTING AND RUNNING THEIR INFORMATION THROUGH CLASS SO THEY DO BOTH. PROTOCOLS THEIR- AND RUNNING THEIR INFORMATION DO CLASS WOULD YIELD MISSING PERSON INFORMATION AND WANTED PERSON INFORMATION. MY FINDING IS THAT THE JUVENILE HALL BOOKING PROCESS SHOULD NOT DIFFER FROM THIS BECAUSE- HOW TO RUN AWAYS BEEN CHECKED IN CLASS THEY WOULD'VE BEEN CLEARED FROM THE SYSTEM MONTHS EARLIER. AND WE COULD HAVE. ENSURE THAT THAT THOSE JUVENILES WERE SAFE. AND I APOLOGIZE FIVE GOING. GOING FASTER SLOWER. HE'S ME. AB SO AGAIN I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO GO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES UNDER WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ENTER MISSING PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM THE NEXT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS DEPENDENT ADULTS THEY'RE CONSIDERED ANY MISSING ADULT TO HAS PHYSICAL OR MENTAL LIMITATIONS WHICH RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT NORMAL ACTIVITIES AGAIN THE DISPATCHER WILL SIGN THE DEPUTY FOR. A SIGN A DEPUTY TO A CALL FOR SERVICE FOR MISSING DEPENDENT ADULT THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF CASES THAT WE SEE IN THIS REGARD OUR ELDERLY WALK AWAY AS WITH ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA. THIS IS DON. SKINNY THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC SEARCH AND RESCUE CALL OUT FROM AGENCY. AS SARS ASSEMBLING THE INVESTIGATING DEPUTY WILL CONTACT THE REPORTING PARTY. FOLLOW PROTOCOL AS EXPLAINED BEFORE REGARDING THE MISSING PERSONS ALFA INFORMATION AND TRAIN TO CLIENTS. WILL QUICKLY CHECK THE PROPERTY AND SURROUNDING AREA WHERE THE PERSON WAS LAST SEEN IT IS NOT A TYPICAL FOR A DEPUTY TO LOCATE THE MISSING PERSON BEFORE SORRY EVEN ARRIVED ON SCENE. ONE OF OUR RECENT SEARCHES OF THIS TYPE WAS FR A SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD MALE WITH EARLY STAGES OF DEMENTIA HE WENT ON HIS DAILY WALK ON HIS THIRTY FIVE ACRE PROPERTY AND DID NOT RETURN ON THIS PARTICULAR WEDNESDAY. THIS IMMEDIATELY TURNED INTO A SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION WHEN THE FAMILY REPORTED HIM MISSING. THROUGHOUT THREE DAYS OF SEARCHING SIXTEEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES RESPONDED AS MUTUAL AID TO ASSIST IN THE SEARCH VARYING FROM GROUND SEARCHING TO FLYING OVERHEAD WITH DRONES AND HELICOPTERS. TO UTILIZING SEARCH DOGS. WE HAD ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO SEVENTY FIVE SEARCHERS AT ONE TIME AND ARE SEARCHES CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THIS MAN WAS FOUND ALIVE ON SATURDAY AND AS THE CROW FLIES. HE WAS ABOUT TWO MILES FROM HIS RESIDENCE. I AM. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT MOST OF THESE CASES ARE RESOLVED WITHIN A SHORT TIME FRAME BECAUSE OF THE DEDICATION OF OUR SEARCH AND RESCUE MEMBERS. BUT THERE ARE VERY UNFORTUNATE INSTANCES WHERE THE MISSING PERSON SIMPLY CANNOT BE LOCATED. THEY REMAIN IN THE MAPS EVEN IF THEY ARE PRESUMED TO BE DECEASED. THE NEXT CATEGORY IS. IT CATASTROPHE VICTIMS CITIES ARE MISSING PERSONS THAT ARE VICTIMS OF A DISASTER SUCH AS A BOATING ACCIDENT PLANE CRASH EARTHQUAKE FLOOD OR FIRE THE ASSIGNED DEPUTY WILL RESPOND AND OBTAIN THE SAME INFORMATION THE SAME INITIAL INFORMATION AS BEFORE THESE CASES ARE UNIQUE IN THAT WE KNOW THE VICTIMS WERE INVOLVED WITH SOME SORT OF DISASTER WE JUST DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM OR WHERE THEY PHYSICALLY ARE. I'M A GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXACT A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THE SITUATION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY FIRST AND MARCH TWENTY THIRD. MARIPOSA COUNTY AND ALONG WITH MOST OF THE STATE DEALT WITH THE STORM AND SEVERE FLOODING THAT FORCED MANY ROAD CLOSURES. AND SEVERELY DAMAGED INFRASTRUCTURE THE RESPONSE ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN A PROCLAMATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY THE MOST INTENSE DAY OF THIS STORM WAS ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND. ON A TWO THIRDS ON MARCH TWENTY THIRD AMERICA'S A COUNTY RECEIVED A BILL WELL THE BE ON THE LOOK OUT. FROM A NEIGHBORING COUNTY FOR JOHN ON ESTO WHO WORKED AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER AT AMERICA'S A COUNTY SCHOOL. THIS IS WHERE HE WAS LAST SEEN ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND. WITH THE INFORMATION THAT JOHN LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY AND WAS LIKELY TO USE HIGHWAY ONE THIRTY TWO TO GET HOME DEPUTIES CONCLUDED HE WAS POSSIBLY SWEPT AWAY IN THE FLOOD. THAT TOOK OUT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FEET OF HIGHWAY ONE THIRTY TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN OUR HIGHWAY. DEPUTIES BEGAN A IS A FOOT SIR THE DRAINAGE AND LOCAL LOCATED A SEVERELY DAMAGED VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE MILES DOWNSTREAM. FROM THE WASH OUT ALONG WITH SEVERAL CAR PARKED. THE VAN MATCHED JOHNS TOYOTA AVALON WHICH SHE WAS DRIVING AT THE TIME. DOUBLE A AND MULTIPLE AGENCIES ARE OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED. INCLUDING FOOT SEARCHERS BOAT SEARCHERS. DOG TEAMS AND DRAWN OPERATORS. TO DATE ME EITHER JOHN OR ANY OF HIS REMAINS HAD BEEN LOCATED BUT THE SEARCH CONTINUES. ALSO ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAROL BROWN WAS REPORTED MISSING BY HER HUSBAND. CAROL HAD GONE OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON THE HORSES DURING THE STORM HER HUSBAND LOCATED THE UTILITY VEHICLE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DRIVING OVERTURNED IN THE FLOODED CREEK SEARCH AND RESCUE RESPONDED. TO SEARCH FOR CAROL THIS INCIDENT ALSO TURNED INTO A MULTI DAY SEARCH. CAROL PARTIAL REMAINS WERE LOCATED BY A CADAVER DOG IN JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AS WE RESEARCH THE CREEK AND DEBRIS PILES IT WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH DNA TESTING THAT THERE REMAINS WORK CAROL BRAUN THE I'M NOT DIVISION AT DOJ WE ARE TO KEEP HER CASE IN THE MAPS AND TELL ALL OF HER REMAINS ARE LOCATED. THE NEXT IS WEB. TITLED AS A VOLUNTARY MISSING ADULT WHICH IS TWENTY ONE EIGHT AGE TWENTY ONE AND OVER. WHICH IS A MISSING ADULT WHO IS LEFT ON HIS OR HER OWN FREE WILL THE DISPATCHER WILL ASSIGN A DEPUTY THEY'LL AN AS BEFORE WE GATHER THE VICTIMS INFORMATION ENTER THEM INTO MAPS AND ATTEMPT CONTACT. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION WE TYPICALLY WILL RUN THE LICENSE PLATE TO SEE IF THEIR VEHICLE WAS TOWED WHICH COULD DIRECT US TO THE AGENCY THAT TELL THEM AND FOLLOW UP WITH THEM TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT. AND WE ALSO CONTEXT ROUNDING AGENCIES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO INQUIRE ABOUT TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. WE SHARE INFORMATION OF THIS QUE OF OUR CASES WITH OUR PARTNERS ON SHIPS SO THEY CAN ALSO BE WELL AND CROSS REFERENCE ANY ASSOCIATES THAT MAYBE. MYSELF I MYSELF OVERLOOKED. AND THE CASE REMAINS OPEN UNTIL THE SUBJECT IS CONTACTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE NEXT IS THE STRANGER ABDUCTION. WHICH IS A MISSING PERSON TAKEN BY A STRANGER THIS INCLUDES CASES OF UNKNOWN OF DOCTOR WHO IS NOT A FAMILY A FAMILY MEMBER. AN EXAMPLE FROM POST IS A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS REPORTED MISSING WHEN SHE FAILS TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND A NEIGHBOR REPORTS SEEING HER BEING PHYSICALLY FORCED INTO A VAN BY AN UNKNOWN MAN. THE DEPUTY HAS THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY REGARDS TO GATHERING INFORMATION BUT THIS SITUATION WITH THE TO AN AMBER ALERT. AMBER ALERT HAS VERY SPECIFIC. THE FIRST IS THE ELDEST AND ADOPTED OR AKEN BY ANYONE INCLUDED BUT NOT LIMITED TO A CUSTODIAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. THE VICTIM IS SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE OR YOUNGER OR HAS PROVEN HAS A PROVEN MENTAL OR PHYSICAL DISABILITY. THE VICTIM IS IN IMMINENT DANGER OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH AND THERE IS INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT IF SHARED WITH THE PUBLIC. COULD ASSIST IN THE CHILD SAFE RECOVERY THIS IS A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL FUNCTION THE H. B. HANDLES THE MESSAGING IN COORDINATION WITH A P. B. NET. YES AND THE WE ARE. BLUE ALERTS AND SILVER ALERTS WOULD ALSO FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY AS FAR AS THE MISSING PERSON ENTRY GOES AND AS SUCH AS BLUE ALERTS AND SILVER ALERTS AND THEY'RE ALSO INITIATED THROUGH C. H. P. THE REST THE NIGHT. THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE PERSONAL EXAMPLES OUT THERE JUST. EXAMPLES THAT I'VE RECEIVED FROM POST FROM THEIR GUIDELINES IN HANDLING MISSING PERSON CASES. THE NEXUS PARENTAL OR FAMILY ABDUCTION. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD HIS REPORTED MISSING BY THE CHILD'S MOTHER. WHO IS THE CUSTODIAL PARENT AFTER THE BOYS PICKED UP FROM SCHOOL BY THE BOY'S FATHER AND TAKEN TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION. NEXT IS UNKNOWN CIRCUMSTANCES. A MANAGER PORTED MISSING AFTER HE FAILED TO RETURN HOME. IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AFTER TAKING THE FAMILY DOG OUT FOR A WALK. SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES EXAMPLE IS A WOMAN WHO IS EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT AND LIVES WITH HER PARENTS AS REPORTED MISSING WHEN SHE DOES NOT RETURN HOME FROM A SHOPPING TRIP AND IS LAST SEEN GETTING INTO A VEHICLE. AND LEAVING THE PARKING LOT WITH TWO MEN. THE LAST CATEGORY IS LOST WHICH IS A CHILD OR ADULT WHO IS REPORTED TO HAVE STRAIGHT AWAY AND HIS WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN. CHEN C. WITH. THEY WERE IN REGARD OCCURS OR LOST HUNTERS WE SEE SOMEONE OFTEN OUR BACKYARDS ARE WOODED AREAS. IN ANY CASE IS THE PRACTICE AMERICA'S A COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKE PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE MISSING PERSON BEFORE YOU WE REMOVE THEM FROM THE MAPS AND CLOSE THE CASE ONE RECENT EXCEPTION TO THIS WAS A CASE INVOLVING A WOMAN WHO WAS REPORTED MISSING OF TO HAWAII. IS ARREST AND HOW THE N. NCIC ADVISE THE BOOKING INFORMATION WOULD SUFFICE TO- SHOW THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER MISSING FROM OUR PANEL REPORT APPERTAINING THE BOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE CASE FILE WAS ABLE TO CLEAR THAT. THIS PERSON THE MAPS AS FAR AS AN UNIDENTIFIED REMAINS GO OUR MOST RECENT MAPS ENTRIES OF THOSE TYPES ORIGINATED IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK PARK RANGER PARK RANGERS HANDLE THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS WE ARE JUST THE CORNERS THEY LOCATE SUCH PAINS IN REGARDS TO RECORD. AND I. UNLIKE PROMISED I DID NOT FIND A DECENT SPOT FOR ME TO TALK ABOUT MY TIME RESPONSE. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE'S A NORMAL TIME RESPONSE IN IN EVERY SINGLE CASE. PENAL CODE ONE FOUR TWO ONE ONE DOES DESIGNATE THAT WE HAVE TO SUBMIT THE ENTRIES INTO MAPS WITH AND- FOR TWO HOURS FOR JUVENILES OR FOUR HOURS OTHERWISE. BUT AS FAR AS GETTING TO THE ORIGINAL PARTY THERE'S NO TIME FRAME FROM WHEN I READ THE CALL TO ONE EIGHT CONTACT THEM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY. BECAUSE IT IT JUST QUESTIONABLE IF WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DIFFERENT- HIGH PRIORITY CALL WE HAVE TO FINISH THAT AND SEE IF WE CAN OPEN SOMEBODY ELSE UP TO RESPOND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF THINGS IN PLAY WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO. GETTING THAT HAPPY TO PHYSICALLY GO TALK TO THE REPORTING PARTY OR GIVE THEM A CALL. CERTAINLY IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE DEPENDING ON WHAT OTHER PRIORITIES ARE ON YOUR DESK AND WHETHER YOU'RE- HANDLING ANOTHER MISSING PERSON CASE AT THE SAME TIME WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE BUT- I THINK YOU MADE THE POINT CLEAR TO US THAT. THAT YOU DO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THAT MISSING PERSON CASES. SHOULD BE HANDLED THE HEAD OF PROPERTY CASES AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S A MATTER OF RESOURCES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME BUT- I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS IS A MISSING PERSON CASE IS HANDLED AHEAD OF. OF SOME OF THE OTHER CASES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABSOLUTELY AND OUR DISPATCHERS PRIORITIZE AT THE SAME WAY AS WELL ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD- I UNDERSTAND THAT NCIC IS. IS THE NATIONAL DATABASE FOR COLLECTION OF MISSING PERSON RECORDS. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENTERING SOMEBODY INTO AND SEE I SEE IS THAT. IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE YOU YOU'VE ENTERED INTO THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND IT AUTOMATICALLY UPLOADS OR DO YOU HAVE TO UPLOAD. YOU HAVE TO ENTER INTO AND SEE I SEE SEPARATELY HOW DOES THAT WORK IT IS. AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED SO WE MAKE THE ENTRY INTO THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM INTO THE MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SYSTEM. AND IT AUTOMATICALLY GETS UP LOADED. TO NCIC. AND JUST FOR UNDERSTANDING AND SEE I SEE IS THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER STATES USE AS FAR AS THEIR THEIR STATE SYSTEMS BUT ALL OF THOSE SHOULD BE TALKING TO NCIC WHICH IS WHY WHEN I RUN SOMEBODY'S INFORMATION IN CLASS I CAN SEE IF THEY'RE MISSING OUT OF TEXAS OR IF THEY'RE WANTED OUT OF TEXAS FOR EXAMPLE. ANY WHAT CASE WULD YOU ENTER SOMEBODY INTO THE FEDERAL SYSTEM BY CAP THE VIOLENT INFORMATION. I'M EVEN DRAWING A BLANK ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT STANDS FOR. THE VIOLENT CRIME AND APPREHENSION PROGRAM I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH BY CAP AND ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO MISSING PERSONS SO IF THAT'S THE- SHORTCOMING THAT WE HAVE ADDRESSED- YOU'VE ADDRESS THEN THAT. YOUR ANSWER I DON'T HAVE ANY- EXPERIENCE WITHOUT THAT'S OKAY SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT B ABLE TO ANSWER THAT. THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. MAP PLEASE. I'M A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE NINE CATEGORIES THAT YOU X. OF THAT A FEW EXPLAINED OR SHARED WITH US RATHER- YOU TALKED ABOUT TWENTY ONE AND OLDER LEFTON THEIR OWN. WHY WOULD THEY BE REPORTED MISSING IF THEY'RE AN ADULT LIKE CAN YOU SURE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT POINT I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ADULTS THE WALKED AWAY. WHY WOULD YOU FIND THAT AS A- PERSON. WHY WOULD I. ENTER IT IS MISSING BUT WHY WOULD SOMEONE REPORTS SOMEONE THAT'S- AN ADULT WHO JUST LAUGHED I THINK YOU JUST SAID THEY HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE AND OLDER. WHO LEFT ON THEIR OWN. SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THE CATEGORIES TO FILE A MISSING PERSON. BEING BEING IN THE FIELD AM I TRULY FEEL THAT THE VOLUNTARY I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S CALLED ON TERRY MISSING THAT'S JUST WHAT'S BEEN DESIGNATED FROM DOJ AS A CATEGORY FOR US TO AND PUT SOMEBODY. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS- MORE OF A CATCH ALL IF THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION IT'S- DETERMINED THAT THAT PERSON MISSING. DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE OTHER CATEGORIES THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE MISSING WE DON'T NECESSARILY FEEL THAT THEY ARE A- CASH REBATES. OR THAT THEY'RE LOST IN THE WOODS SOMEWHERE BUT THEY ARE MISSING. DO SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION AND THE P. REQUIRES HAVE TO ENTER THEM INTO WE JUST NEED TO CUT THEM IN THE SYSTEM- BUT GOING BACK TO THE WOMAN WHO IS FOUND. IN HAWAII. HER MOTHER WAS THE THAT REPORTED HER. MATTER OF FACT THAT THAT PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND BY THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SO THAT THAT'S ANOTHER ASPECT YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. SENATOR CAVEA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY HE WAS REALLY WELL ORGANIZED AND UNDERSTANDABLE I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH IN TERMS OF THE- PROCESSING THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN THEM UP SYSTEM. AND MANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS HAVE COMPUTERS IN THEIR IN THEIR VEHICLES IS- IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO THE INPUT INTO THE SYSTEMS FROM THE VEHICLE OR IS THIS THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU'D NEED TO GO BACK TO YOUR- YOUR- STATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. INPUT WITH AMERICA'S ACCOUNT I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO WEAR FOR THE COUNTY AND MADERA COUNTY- SO BEING A DISPATCHER FOR BOTH AGENCIES. THAT'S HOW WE HANDLE THEM. THE INPUTS INTO MAPS ARE THAT THEY GO THROUGH DISPATCH AND THAT THAT MIGHT JUST BE FOR RECORD KEEPING. SIDE OF IT- BUT EVEN THOUGH SOME AGENCIES YOU HAVE ACCESS AND THEIR VEHICLES. THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MIGHT NOT HAVE THE TRAINING TO ACTUALLY AND PUT THEM INTO CLASS BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CLASS TRAINING THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCESS TO CLASS SO I IS A DEPUTY IN THE FIELD ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO INQUIRE INTO CLASS AS OPPOSED TO MY DISPATCHERS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO AND PUT OKAY SO YOU ACTUALLY GO THROUGH YOUR DISPATCHERS IN ORDER TO FILE THOSE REPORTS RIGHT IN I'M- AND BUT- YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT APPRECIATE IT THANK. YOU I ASSUME THAT THERE'D BE SOME- INTERNET. ET COMPLICATIONS- BECAUSE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT NOT HAVING INTERNET RURAL CALIFORNIA- EVERYWHERE YOU GO BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE. IT PROBABLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE-TO GO TO THE DISPATCHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE LOCATED. AND MAKE THEIR THEIR JOB IS TO HANDLE KIND OF THE DATA RIGHT AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOUR AT TO OF COURSE. AND IN MY DISTRICT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND WE HAD THE RECOVERY OF THREE WOMEN FROM A WELL IN A BABY AND THEN TWO OTHER WOMEN FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY- MOST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD GONE MISSING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NINETEEN NINE. NINE EIGHTY FIVE AND ONE MORE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. CELL ACTUALLY ALL OF THOSE CASES THOSE INDIVIDUALS WENT MISSING BEFORE THE STATE HAD A DATABASE. AN INTACT BECAUSE THE STATE STATUTE DIDN'T GO INTO A FACT INTEL TWO THOUSAND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SO. WE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS COMING FORWARD- CALLING THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE CALLING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WANTING TO PROVIDE DNA. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US. AT WHAT POINT IN HOW YOU DETERMINE. WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER SHOULD BE PROVIDING DNA FOR A MISSING PERSON BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT JUVENILES HAVE GONE MISSING THAT YOU'VE YOU FIND THEM FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER. I AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE REMAINS ARE FOUND SO WHAT A HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE AND- AND GO BACK TO THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AND ENSURE THAT THEIR DNA IS COLLECTED IN ADDED INTO THE- A FEDERAL REPOSITORY OF DNA. SO PENAL CODE I GOT THIS. BET IT'S CALLED REPORTING REFERENCE CHART DIRECTLY FROM DOJ WHICH WAS VERY INFORMATIONAL AND IT LAYS OUT THE DIFFERENT AGES OF A MISSING PERSON AND SOME DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT BASES IN REGARDS TO HANDLING THE CASE THERE ONE THAT SPEAKS TO DNA AND- THE NECESSITY TO ADVISE FAMILY THE RIGHT TO SUBMIT SUCH A SAMPLE AND MUST BE DONE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND THAT'S PER PENAL CODE ONE FOUR TWO FIVE ZERO PARENTHESES FEE PRACTICES TO. SELL IT ACTUALLY IN PENAL CODE THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A SAMPLE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. BUT IT IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION I WOULD NECESSARILY A WRIST BE THE RESPONDING OFFICER AND TAKE THE INFORMATION OF A LOVED ONE GOING MISSING AND SAY OKAY WELL ARE YOU READY TO PROVIDE A DNA SAMPLE BEFORE WE EVEN TRY MASTICATING M. THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THE TIME FRAME IS IMPORTANT TO STICK TO ABOUT THIRTY DAYS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TRY SOME OTHER OPPORTUNE TAKES UP OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO DO. AN INVESTIGATION OTHERWISE. WOULD YOU WOULD IT BE YOUR BELIEF THAT IF SOMEONE TO ROUTE WERE TO REPORTED MISSING FAMILY MEMBER TODAY. THAT AND IF THEY WERE NOT FOUND WITHIN THIRTY DAYS THAT THAT FAMILY MEMBER WOULD HAVE A REASONABLE. RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT. THE DNA THEY PROVIDED WOULD EXIST AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OR IS IT THAT THERE'S NOT QUITE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THERE THE DNA WOULD BE IN A FEDERAL RESERVE POSITIVE WORRY MY UNDERSTANDING SO WHEN WE GO. WHEN WE OBTAIN A DNA SAMPLE FROM A LOVED ONE OR FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. IT GOES INTO THE- LOTUS WHICH IS COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM. AND KODY'S SPEAKS TO NCIC AND MOPS SO. IF YOU REMEMBER IN MY PRESENTATION- REGARDING CAROL BRAUN WE HAVE TO KEEP HER ENTRY AND MOPS UNTIL ALL OF HER REMAINS ARE FOUND AND THAT'S PER DOJ THAT'S A GOOD POINTING SYSTEM TO SHOW ANY ADDITIONAL REMAINS. WE CAN POINT TO THAT CODE IS CENTURY AND WHAT IT IS THE SAME REMAINS SO. CODICE DOES SPEAK TO BOTH OF THEM. EVEN THOUGH THEY COME FROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND STATE LEVEL. IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION I THINK SO I THINK SO I KNOW THAT- IN THE CASE OF SANDY VANDER HIDING WHO WENT MISSING FROM MY DISTRICT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE MISSING WOMEN WHO WERE RECOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FROM CALAVERAS. THERE IS A PARTIAL. OF CANDY- IN OR AROUND FEBRUARY ELEVENTH TWELFTH AND THEN. A LATER THAT MONTH THERE WAS A SECOND RECOVERY EFFORT WHERE. ADDITIONAL REMAINS WERE RECOVERED- FOR SANDY SO I UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT EVEN THOUGH SOME PARTIAL REMAINS MIGHT BE RECOVERED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS DNA REMAINS IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL SYSTEM RAY AND I DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHERE WHERE IT'S HOUSED- CURTIS'S INFORMATION. BUT WE SEND IT OFF TO THEM AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO STORE IT INDEFINITELY THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU. TO HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. NOW OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND NEXT WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF ORDER JUST A BIT- IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE TRAVEL PLANS ON WITH THIS NEXT WE HAVE MAKING ACTUAL MEN WHO IS THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS UNIT WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS MOPS AND TO PREACH THE CORE AERATION.

THE MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SECTION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ASSIST LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES IN LOCATING MISSING PERSONS AND IDENTIFYING UNKNOWN LIVE INDICES PERSONS THROUGH THE COMPARISON OF PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS FINGERPRINTS AND DENTAL AND BODY X. RAYS. THE MAPS MAINTAIN STATEWIDE FILES CONTAINING THE DENTAL RECORDS MEDICAL RECORDS PHOTOGRAPHS AND PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS. THE PHYSICAL IDENTIFICATION COMPONENT COMPARES REPORTS OF MISSING PERSONS AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR POSSIBLE MATCHES POSSIBLE MATCHES CAN BE MADE FROM COMPARISON OF PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS HAIR COLOR EYE COLOR HEIGHT AND WEIGHT OR FROM COMPARISON OF OTHER FARE PHYSICAL IDENTIFIER SUCH AS CLOTHING JEWELRY. SCARS OR TATTOOS. PHYSICAL IDENTIFICATION STAFF ALSO MAKE INQUIRIES INTO A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE DATABASES SUCH AS ACCURATE DEFINED INFORMATION WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOCATION OF PERSONS REPORTED MISSING OR TO PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF LIFE. ANY INFORMATION FOUND IS DISCLOSED TO THE REPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THESE DATABASES ARE ALSO USED TO ASSIST IN LOCATING NEXT OF KIN PROJECT NOTIFICATIONS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE CALIFORNIA BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE DENTAL IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM TO PROCESS DENTAL RECORDS SUBMITTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES. ARE STAFF CLASSIFY INDEX AND COMPARED DENTAL RECORDS OF MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR POSSIBLE MATCHES IF A MATCH IS MADE BASED ON DENTAL RECORDS THE CONTRIBUTING AGENCIES ON BOTH SIDES ARE NOTIFIED.

THE CLEARING HOUSE PROVIDES FREE OF CHARGE FINGERPRINT CARDS TO AGENCIES FOR VOLUNTARY FINGERPRINTING OF CHILDREN. MAPS OPERATES AND MAINTAINS THE CALIFORNIA MISSING PERSON SYSTEM OR M. P. S. WERE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ENTER MISSING PERSON RECORDS AND INFORMATION WHICH IS THEN IMMEDIATELY ELECTRONICALLY FORWARDED TO THE FBI'S NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER OR AND SEE I SEE. MTS IS ACCESSIBLE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT VIA THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM OR CLASS. AND PS WAS FIRST MANDATED IN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. AS OF MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE ACTIVE MISSING PERSON RECORDS IN THE CALIFORNIA MISSING PERSON SYSTEM AN INTERN IN NCIC. ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE OF THOSE CASES HAVE DENTAL INFORMATION ON FILE WITH MAPS. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO OF THOSE CASES ARE CASES WHERE THE PERSON HAS BEEN MISSING FOR OVER ONE YEAR. TO HELP LOCATE MISSING PERSONS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALSO PRODUCES AND DISTRIBUTES A MONTHLY POSTER OF MISSING CHILDREN AND A QUARTERLY BULLETIN OF MISSING CHILDREN AND DEPENDENT ADULTS. THESE PUBLICATIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO LOCALLAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT SUBSCRIBES TO RECEIVE THEM. CURRENT APPLICATIONS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WEBSITE. ADDITIONALLY THE MAPS HAS PARTNERED WITH THE FBI IN THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO COORDINATE AND HOST ANNUAL MISSING IN CALIFORNIA EVENTS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE ISSUES AND IMPACTS SURROUNDING MISSING PERSONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS THE DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO MISSING PERSONS. THE DIRECTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AT THEIR REQUEST WITH TIMELY SEARCH AND RECOVERY OF MISSING CHILDREN. FOR MAINTAINING UP TO DATE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF THOSE PROTOCOLS BEST PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR RECOVERING MISSING CHILDREN IN A TIMELY MANNER. ATTENDING VARIOUS SEMINARS TRAININGS AND CONFERENCES.

ON NAME AS- MAPS PROVIDES TRAINING ON THE DEPARTMENT'S SERVICES TO LINE PERSONAL SUPERVISORS AND INVESTIGATORS WITHIN LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO TWO DAY POST CERTIFIED TRAININGS PROVIDED EACH YEAR LIKE THE ONES HAPPENING TODAY AND TOMORROW TRAININGS ARE PROVIDED AS REQUESTED. WE TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL HOW AND WHEN TO ENTER THEIR CASE DATA INTO M. P. S. AN NC I SEE AS WELL AS OTHER VARIOUS DATABASES SUCH AS NAMYS NECK MAC AND THE F. B. I.'S FILING CRIME CRIMINAL APPREHENSION. PROGRAM OR BY CAP. MUCH TRAINING IS ALSO ADMINISTERED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILD ABDUCTION TASK FORCE WITH SOUL WHICH HOLDS AN ADDITIONAL SIX TO TEN TRAINS ACROSS THE STATE ANNUALLY. I'M ALSO HERE TODAY FROM OUR DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES IS ASSISTANT BUREAU DIRECTOR NIKITA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP THAT YOU PROVIDED TO MY OFFICE I KNOW THAT WE'VE PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION ON SOME OLDER COLD CASES THAT. WERE INDIVIDUALS WENT MISSING MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ADDED. INTO THE STATE SYSTEM SO I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT- YOU MENTIONED THAT AT. AT THIS NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT HAVE DENTALS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM CAN YOU GIVE US THOSE FIGURES AGAIN ENSURE AN APPROXIMATE PERCENTAGE OF THE- OF THE TOTAL OF THOSE WHO ARE STILL MISSING. SOAP CREEK CURRENTLY ACTIVE IN THE SYSTEM WE'RE CLOSE TO TWENTY THOUSAND SO IT'S NINETEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE. ACTIVE MISSING PERSON RECORDS THAT WAS AS OF MARCH FIRST. AND OUT OF THAT NUMBER WE HAVE DENTAL RECORDS ON FILE AT MAPS AND ALSO IN NCIC. FOR ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE OF THEM SAID THAT'S LESS THAN TWO PERCENT. 2% CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THAT NUMBER WOULD BE SMALL AND IF THAT. CHANGED OVER TIME OR IF THAT'S BEEN A PRETTY CONSISTENT PERCENTAGE OVER TIME. I'M EIGHT IT'S GROWN A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME JUST BECAUSE OF PROVIDING TROUT TRAINING AN OUT REACH. THERE'S MANY REASONS WHY THAT NUMBER'S PRETTY SMALL ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE MANY CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ANY DENTAL RECORDS AVAILABLE- THERE'S ALSO CASES WHERE. DENTAL RECORDS ARE NOT ACTUALLY THERE THERE'S NO- GUIDELINES FOR DENTAL OFFICES TO MAINTAIN DENTAL RECORDS. AS A GENERAL PRACTICE THE WILL KEEP THEM FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS BUT IF A PATIENT DOESN'T RETURN AFTER A YEAR SOMETIMES THEY'RE DESTROYED- WITH MANY LOCAL PRACTICES. GOING OUT OF BUSINESS BEING BOUGHT BY AND BIG DENTAL CORPORATIONS THEIR OLDER RECORDS ARE OFTENTIMES DESTROYED AS WELL- SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN SOMEBODY IS REPORTED MISSING TO OBTAIN THOSE DENTAL RECORDS IN A REALLY TIMELY MANNER. SO THAT THEY CAN BE COLLECTED AND MAINTAINED IF THEY'RE SUBMITTED TO US AT DOJ. WE MAINTAIN THEM INDEFINITELY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE OBTAIN ONE TIME FOR SAY A RUN AWAY AND THAT PARTICULAR CHILD COMES AND GOES IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM MANY TIMES WILL JUST KEEP UPDATING THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE DENTAL RECORDS. AND THEN ALSO- SOMETIMESFAMILY MEMBERS DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR LOVED ONES- WENT TO THE DENTIST ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM OTHER STATES. ON YOU KNOW I'VE PERSONALLY I'M FROM PENNSYLVANIA BUT I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO MY MOM WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHO MY DENTIST AS- HERE. A GOOD EXAMPLE. IF A FAMILY MEMBER WERE TO COME FORWARD AND I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SEND STOCKTON WHOSE MOTHER WENT MISSING FROM HAYWARD BUT SHE'S NOW LIVING IN STOCKTON AND SHE CAME TO ME A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND WANTED TO PROVIDE DNA TO BE UPLOADED INTO THE STATE SYSTEM AND INTO THE FEDERAL SET SYSTEM. WHAT IS THE GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FAMILIES ARE BOTH ON HOW THAT SHOULD BEST A QUICK OCCUR. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE DNA WOULD BE UPLOADED INTO THE STATE SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. A WELL WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO BE AS ACCOMMODATING WITH THE FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE SO IT SHOULDN'T MATTER WHERE THAT FAMILY MEMBERS SIDES- WE OFTEN PROVIDE- A LIAISON WITH OTHER- AGENCIES AND OTHER STATES TO OBTAIN. THAT DNA SAMPLES SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THEIR SAMPLES AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THAT REPORT. TO PROVIDE A SAMPLE SO. SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO HER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO PROVIDE A SAMPLE- BUT OF COURSE AT OUR BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES HANDLES ALL OF OUR DNA. COLLECTION PROCEDURES AFTER THAT POINT. IS THERE A CLEAR WAY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO KNOW WHETHER THERE IS DNA ON FILE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S INDICATED AND RECORDS THAT ARE PUBLIC I NOTED AT THE CALIFORNIA DOJ THERE'S THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND SYSTEM THAT IS USED STRICTLY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO IS THERE A WAY FOR A FAMILY MEMBER TO LOOK UP THEIR LOVED ONE. AND KNOW WITH ANY CERTAINTY WHETHER THERE IS DNA ON FILE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE WE WOULD ADVISE THEM TO SPEAK WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THAT PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION OKAY AND THEN FOR THAN THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT YOU GAVE THAT ARE STILL ACTIVE- DO YOU HAVE IT I THINK YOU SAID EARLIER THE NUMBER THAT YOU BELIEVE ARE STILL MISSING AFTER YEARS TIME. CAN YOU GIVE US THAT NUMBER YES AFTER AFTER ONE YEAR AS OF MARCH FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND 201-100-0500 AND TWENTY TWO CASES ARE STILL ACTIVE IN THE SYSTEM. SO THAT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY HALF. LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OKAY. AND SO JUST SO THAT I MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT RECEIVES A REPORT OF A MISSING PERSON THEY REPORTED TO. CALIFORNIA MOPS. AND THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED THROUGH CLASS CRACKED AND TRANSFERRED INTO THE STATE'S DATABASE AND AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED INTO AND SEE I SEE WHERE DOES IT REQUIRE. DOES IT IS IT REQUIRED THAT. CALIFORNIA DOJ PERSONNEL SEPARATELY ENTER INTO AND- LOW IT'S AUTOMATIC IT'S AN AUTOMATIC TRANSFER SO ONCE SO ONCE IT'S ENTERED INTO CLASS IT'S AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED INTO NCIC CRACKED OKAY SO NCIC IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD. THINK OF AS THE PRIMARY FEDERAL DATABASE FOR ALL MISSING PERSON REPORTS AND THEN YOU WHEN YOU MET WITH ME THE OTHER DAY YOU YOU DESCRIBE FOR US THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BY CAP CODE IS NAME AS PERHAPS YOU CAN- FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR BARGES- AND THE AUDIENCE. WALK US THROUGH WHAT OCCURS WITH THE OTHER DATABASES AND MAYBE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE WITH COMMUNITY COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN OTHER WORDS. BECAUSE SOMETHING IS BECAUSE A MISSING PERSON IS UP LOADED INTO ONE SYSTEM DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY UPLOADED INTO ANOTHER SYSTEM AND THEIR REASONS. THAT SOMEONE SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO BY CAP. AS OPPOSED TO NOT BEING ENTERED INTO PHI KAPPA PERHAPS YOU CAN WALK US THROUGH THAT. I'M SO THE I MEAN FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATES INDICATE THAT A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ABSOLUTELY MUST ENTER ANY MISSING PERSON INTO THE MISSING PERSON SYSTEM AND I'M JUST FOR CLARIFICATION IT'S NO THERE'S NO LONGER THE FOUR HOUR REQUIREMENT FOR ADULTS- THAT LARGE CHANGE I THINK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO IT'S TWO HOURS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ANYONE AT RISK OR ANY CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. AND THEN WITHOUT DELAY FOR ANYONE ELSE. FOR THERE WAS A FOUR HOUR DELAY WITH. THEIR WEST UP TO TWENTY FIFTEEN YES I BELIEVE TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT I'D HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK TO OUR- MUST BE COMPLETE TRANSMISSION WITHIN TWO HOURS FOR. FOR ANY ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND ANYONE CONSIDERED AT RISK AND THE PENAL CODE DESCRIBES WHO'S CONSIDERED AT RISK I DON'T KNOW THE CRITERIA OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BUT IT WOULD INCLUDE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED ADULTS- ANYONE WHO'S CONSIDERED TO BE AT HARM PHYSICAL PHYSICAL HARM THERE'S ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT SETS OF CRITERIA FOR AT RISK IS THERE MUCH I'M SORRY. IT SAYS HERE FIRST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT THE MOST CRITICAL FOR A MISSING PERSON. IS THAT ACROSS. IS THAT ACROSS THE BOARD WITH. MINERS AND ADULTS OR IS IT DIFFERENT. FOR MINOR'S. IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IF THE MINOR IS A RUNAWAY VERSES THE MINERS BEEN. TAKEN BY AN ADULT- THE NUMBERS ARE ARE GREATLY DIFFERENT. SO THERE'S THE WASHINGTON STATE STUDY- THAT LOOKED AT. CHILDREN THAT WERE ABDUCTED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED- THOSE NUMBERS THE TIME FRAME IS MUCH SHORTER SO THE CRITICAL TIME FRAME FOR THOSE CASES IS THREE HOURS. AND THEN THE RATE OF LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEING FOUND DECEASED GOES UP 291% I BELIEVE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IF THEY'RE NOT RECOVERED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IN THEIR UNDER EIGHTEEN THEY HAVE A 90% OR FICTION IF THEY RENTAL. FOR THAT THAT UNIQUE CATEGORY. 90% EXPECTED TO SEE STRAIGHT. BUT I CAN GET YOU THAT STUDY AS WELL IF YOU'D LIKE I WOULD ADD TO THAT STATE LEGISLATION PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED THAT THE REPORTS BE DONE FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TO THE CALIFORNIA DOJ ONLY FOR MISSING CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER THE AT THE AGE OF I BELIEVE IT WAS EIGHTEEN. POINT NINE THAT RECENTLY AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE CHANGED THE LAW WITH SENATE BILL TEN SIXTY SIX REQUIRE REPORTING OF ALL MISSING ADULTS IN ADDITION TO TWO CHILDREN YOUNG PEOPLE. CAN YOU CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US YOUR INTERACTION WITH NAMYS YES- SO WE AT. WITHIN MAPS AND WE WORK WITH NAY MISS EVERY SINGLE DAY- WE DO HAVE ONE POSITION WHEN ANALYST POSITION THAT IS ASSIGNED TO NAME S. WE COLLABORATE WITH THEM SO- IF A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR A FAMILY MEMBER. REQUEST THAT WE- PROVIDE INFORMATION TO NAME S. WE DO SO AND THAT'S GENERALLY BIOMETRIC INFORMATION- FINGERPRINTS. DENTAL RECORDS PHOTOGRAPHS. IF WE HAVE CASE REPORTS ON FILED WILL PROVIDE THAT AS WELL- ENTRIES CAN BE MADE INTO NAME IS BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR BY FAMILY MEMBERS OR BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC. I'M CURRENTLY OUR METHOD OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION AND TO NAME A SO IS MANUAL. WITH WE ENTER THE DATA INTO OUR STATE DATABASE AND THEN WE TURN AROUND AND LOG INTO NAME S. AND WE ENTER THE DATA INTO THEIR MANUALLY WE DID LOOK AT PROCESS I SEE THERE'S NO WAY TO DIRECTLY TRANSFER ANY OF THE INFORMATION TO NAME S. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE BUTTON WE CAN HEAD. AND SAY PLEASE THAT MET THE CINEMAS AND UPLOAD THIS NOW SO IT'S JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE. BUT IT IS A GREAT RESOURCE AND- AS I STATED EARLIER IT THEY'RE ONE OF THE PARTNERS THAT WE TRAIN WITH AT ALL OF OUR TRAINING- IN FACT I THINK THE NAME IS PRESENTATION MIGHT BE GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IN SAN DIEGO. IF THERE WAS EL A STATE LAW TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE A REQUIREMENT THAT INDIVIDUALS BE UPLOADED INTO EIGHT NAME IS WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME IN YOUR VIEW. FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE MISSING BEFORE MANDATE BE ISSUE THAT THEY BE. REPORTED TO NAME S. AS WELL. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK FURTHER INTO AND PROBABLY DISCUSS DIRECTLY WITH NAME S. AS WELL. AS TO THE CAPABILITIES- FOR BOTH OF OUR SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IN ADDITION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO PROVIDE IMPACT AS TO. HOW LONG THAT MIGHT TAKE IF SOMEONE IS SUPPOSED TO MANUALLY ENTER SOMEONE INTO. IN DOUBLE SYSTEMS. ABSOLUTELY AND WE WOULD IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN ON WE WOULD HOPE AN ELECTRONIC INTERFACE WHERE WE COULD SEND THAT DATA ELECTRONICALLY. IF YOU WERE TO HAVE A WISHLIST FROM THE LEGISLATURE- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE TO YOU IN THE FUTURE TO- EASE TRANSMISSION AND- HELP WITH. THE COLLECTION OF ELECTRONIC. DATA COMMUNICATING BETWEEN DATABASES IT SECTOR WHAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A TOOL OR TOOLS THAT WE COULD GIVE TO YOU TO- STREAMLINED AND HELP YOU IN RESOLVING SOME OF THE CASES. ON THE TOP OF OUR LIST WOULD BE A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM MORE WE COULD TAKE OUR MANUAL FOLDERS WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF MANILA FOLDERS WHERE WE HAVE ALL OF OUR REPORTS AND MISSING PERSONS REPORTS AND ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND WE MAKE OUR NOTES BY HAND. AND WHEN WE NEED TO LOAD SOMEONE UP TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WEBSITE WE LOG INTO A SEPARATE THING AND WE LOVE THAT UP THERE AND WHEN THAT CASE GETS CLOSED OR CHANGES IN THE MISSING PERSON SYSTEM WE HAVE TO MANUALLY TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND CHANGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WEBSITE. WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD IMPROVE OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND OUR SERVICES THAT WE COULD OFFER TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES FOR MISSING PERSONS AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS SO WE COULD HAVE. A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ELECTRONICALLY INTERFACE WITH OUR AG'S WEBSITE AND OTHER- INTERFACES AS WELL SUCH AS NAY MATH AND ALLOW US TO ELECTRONICALLY MANAGE OUR RECORDS AND HAVE THESE RECORD STORE TO MAINTAIN AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. THAT WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PERHAPS WE CAN CONSIDER THAT GOING FORWARD. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT OPTION. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER PORCHES. OKAY I'M SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE DINNER. THAT THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE COMPATIBLE ENOUGH THAT IF CHANGES IN ONE ARE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE PARTNERING. RECEIVING ENTITY IS IT A TECH ISSUE YOUR TIME A DATA MANAGEMENT BUT IT IS THIS NOT A TECH ELIGIBLE SOLUTION IT'S BOTH THE TECHNOLOGY COULD EXIST IF WE BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM OUR STATE SYSTEM IS. FAIRLY OLD I'M IT'S BUILT ON MESSAGE KEYS- THE COURT SYSTEM MESSAGE WHAT'S- THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO IT BUT IT'S RESOURCES MONETARY RESOURCES AND M HAVING THE EXPERTISE TO COME IN AND HELP US DO THIS. I'M IT CAN BE DONE IT'S JUST. TAKES MONEY. THE RIGHT NOW I JUST THE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CLEAR AND I THINK I AM WE ARE MOVING ON. THIS IS GONNA SOUND- TO METRIC ORIENTED BUT WE LIVE IN. A DATA DRIVEN WORLD LISTEN THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS AND TRYING TO. PUSH FOR THE IMMEDIACY OF THE SITUATION. IF WE'RE USING. TIME OF UNDER TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN SOME INSTANCES AND UNDER THREE HOURS IN CERTAIN INSTANCES. ARE THERE INSTANCES WHERE IS THERE ANY METRICS ARE ANY HIT DATA HISTORY THAT INDICATES THE TIME IT TAKES TO UPLOAD INFORMATION. FROM ONE SOURCE INTO A SECOND AND THAT SECOND BEING WITH IN A JURISDICTION THAT COULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN HELPFUL IN TRACKING AN INDIVIDUAL. USING THE TIME LINES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS THERE ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT APPROPRIATION COULD SOUND LIKE THERE WOULD BE. THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING LIVES BY A INTEROPERABLE IMPROVING THE INTER OPERABILITY OF THESE SYSTEMS. WE WOULD BE IMPROVING THE INTER OPERABILITY BUT WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THROUGH CLASS THAT ALLOWS US TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO US INTO THE NATIONAL SYSTEM WITHIN THE MANDATED TIME FRAMES NOW. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER MANAGE IT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND TO MAKE SURETHAT ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS AND THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DATA TO ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS AND SO YES IT IS. I THINK IT WOULD DEFINITELY IF WE COULD. UTILIZE THE SYSTEM TO FOR INSTANCE- CONNECT WITH C. H. P. AS AS INDICATED EARLIER. FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND TACK WHICH IS THEIR EMERGENCY SYSTEM THAT'S OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY ITS HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT'S TO FOR THE MOST PART ISSUES AMBER ALERTS SILVER ALERTS ENDANGERED MISSING ADVISORIES- IF WE COULD EASILY TRANSMIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO THEM AS WELL THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO YOU TAKEN. SYSTEM SURE THE IN IN IN IN OUR SYSTEM THE MISSING PERSON IS A BLONDE. AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE. IN AND ACTUALLY A BRUNETTE. AND IF THAT GOES OUT TO A DIFFERENT SET OF AUTHORITIES. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE FOR YOUR SYSTEM IT WILL EVENTUALLY. BE MADE AVAILABLE IN INFORMATION IN A IN A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION WHETHER BE FEDERAL OR YOU NAME IT. YOU'RE ABLE TO IMPROVE YOU'RE ABLE TO TRANSMIT THAT INFORMATION IN ENOUGH TIME THAT YOU SATISFIED THE- THE STATUTORY DEMANDS OR WHATEVER HE'S LEGISLATION CONTROLS ON THIS ISSUE. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAVING EVEN MORE TIME SO THAT IF THE HAIR COLOR IS DIFFERENT FROM THE INITIAL DATA ENTRY POINT TO THE SECOND UPDATED DATA POINT IN YOUR SENDING OUT INFORMATION I THINK COACH ARGUMENT COULD STILL BE MADE THAT. THE FASTER INFORMATION IS EXCHANGED AND MADE AVAILABLE ACROSS JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY DEALS PRECISELY ON HELPING DEAL WITH MISSING PERSONS. CERTAINLY I BELIEVE YOU JUST MADE THE CASE FOR WHY THEY NEED THE ELECTRONIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THAT MAKES. MAKE MAKE SENSE. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD. WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH TIME TO THINK ABOUT. WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO INCLUDING YOU AND FUTURE HEARINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL HAVE AND REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT TODAY TO BE TO PRESENT TO OUR COMMITTEE AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ZERO. YEAH. OKAY TIMELINE. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE CHIRLA CONTROL WHO IS THE DISPATCHER OF THE CITRUS HEIGHTS POLICE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE AS THE WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HER TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING CALLS CONCERNING MISSING PERSONS AND PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF HER ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES TO INITIATE AN INTER MISSING PERSON CASES INTO THE RESPECTIVE DATABASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MADAM CHAIRWOMAN FOR INVITING ME AND DETECTIVE RAINY KEYLESS WHILE IT'S VERY RARE THAT A DISPATCHER IS ASKED TO PARTICIPATE. IN ANY SORT OF THESE LEGISLATIVE REVIEWS AND SO IT IS AN HONOR TO BE INCLUDED. I AM WHEN A REPORTING PARTY CALLS INTO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND- W. CARROLL DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE INITIAL PROCESS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE DISPATCHER HE TAKES THAT INITIAL CALL FOR SERVICE. MUST UTILIZE ACTIVE LISTENING SKILLS WHILE ENGAGING IN A PRECISE INTERROGATION OF THAT REPORTING PARTY. SO OFTEN TIMES IF IT'S A REPEAT MISSING PERSON SUCH AS A CHILD FROM A GROUP HOME. YOUR REPORTING PARTY MAY BE A MINIMUM MINIMUM WAGE STAFF WORKER WHOSE BURNED OUT. WHO HAS A LITTLE BIT OF COMPLACENCY AND THEY MAY NOT BE PROVIDING AS MUCH INFORMATION AS IS REQUIRED TO DO A QUALITY MAPS ENTRY. SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE TO THE DISPATCHER FACES AND IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING AFTER THE ACCURATE INFORMATION. I'M ANOTHER COMPLICATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THE REPORTING PARTY. IS THAT IT'S A TRAGIC EVENT IT'S A IT'S A TRUE CRITICAL MISSING SUCH AS A YOUNG CHILD OR A LOVED ONE. AND THE DISPATCHER MUST NOT ONLY DO THAT PRECISE INTERROGATION. BUT ALSO USE ALL THIS ALL THE SKILLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO CALM THAT REPORTING PARTY. MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING ACCURATE INFORMATION ALL SAME SIMULTANEOUSLY GATHERING THAT DATA FOR THE RADIO DISPATCHER TO SEND THE RESPONSE. OFTENTIMES I'M SPEAKING ONLY AS FIVE DISPATCHER WHO'S WORKED IN A- COMMUNICATIONS AYE THAT'S IN A HOUSE IN A POLICE DEPARTMENT OUT OF SOME OF HIS WORK CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS AN OFF SITE. TYPE OF DISPATCH CENTER. OFTENTIMES WE WORK AS THE INITIAL INCIDENT COMMANDER. ORGANIZING THE RESPONSE INTELLIGENCE A COMMAND POST TO SET UP AN INCIDENT COMMANDER IS NAMED. SO DURING A CRITICAL MISSING YOUR RADIO DISPATCHER MAY ACTUALLY BE ORGANIZING THAT SEARCH GRAD. FIGURING OUT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED SUCH AS- HELICOPTER SEARCH AND RESCUE. A CANINE WHAT ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES WE HAVE SUCH AS DOING WHAT WE CALL AN EVER BRIDGER REVERSE NINE ONE SYSTEM TO NOTIFY THE PUBLIC OF THE MISSING PERSON. AND USING SOCIAL MEDIA IN ORDER TO ALERT THE PUBLIC. I'M AND WE ALSO WHILE WE'RE- DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WORK TAKING OFFICER SAFETY IS RESPONDING INTO MIND. AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS AS WELL BEFORE THE UNITS RESPOND. AFTER THE INITIAL INTERROGATION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE LAST KNOWN LOCATION OF THE MISSING PERSON. THEIR NAME DATE OF BIRTH DESCRIPTORS BUT THEIR LAST SEEN WEARING. I'M A POSSIBLE DESTINATION OR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. WHAT THE TIME ELEMENT WAS WHEN THEY WERE LAST SEEN. AND ANY SORT OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE AT RISK FACTORS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH OR COGNITION THAT'S ALL THAT INITIAL INTERROGATION AT THE DISPATCHER HAS TO DO. THAT WE NEED TO SET THE TONE FOR THAT RESPONSE AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A- NOT A MISCONCEPTION BUT I THINK THAT A MISUNDERSTANDING OF. THE DISPATCHERS ONE THAT THAT SAYS THAT PRIORITY SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW LONG DID IT TAKE SOMEONE TO RESPOND A MISSING PERSONS CALL. IF AS YOU KNOW IT WAS OF A FOR ITS AS- VOLUNTARY MISSING ADULT WHO JUST DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILY. THAN ANYTHING THAT'S IN PROGRESS SUCH AS A WEAPONS CALL OR IF I CALL FOR A CAR ACCIDENT IS GONNA BE DISPATCHED PRIOR TO THAT VOLUNTARY MISSING ADULT AND THE DISPATCHERS WHEN IT'S MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. IF IT IS A CRITICAL MISSING PERSON THEN WE'RE GOING TO USE EVERY RESOURCE AT OUR DISPOSAL AND THEY'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT SAYS THAT EMERGENCY. RESPONSE THEY'RE GONNA NOTIFY THEIR SERGEANT WHO IN TURN IS GOING TO FOLLOW THEIR NOTIFICATION MATRIX UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND AND IF NEEDED THEN WE'RE GOING TO ALSO ASK FOR ALLIED AGENCIES TO COME IN AFTER THE RESOURCE FOR US. I'M. IN TURN THE DISPATCHER I AM. WHO IS RECEIVING INFORMATION AFTER THE OFFICER RESPONDS AND GETS THE- MISSING PERSONS FORM BACK FROM THE OFFICER WHO'S DOING THE DATA ENTRY THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE USING EVERY RATE RESOURCE AT THEIR DISPOSAL THAT THEY'RE USING THE MOST ACCURATE UP TO DATE INFORMATION. AND YOU WE HAVE THIS TERM THAT WE GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE CALL PACKED THE RECORD AND WHAT THEY MEAN BY THAT IS PUT EVERY SINGLE THING THAT YOU CAN INTO THAT INITIAL ENTRY AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FIELDS THAT WE CAN USE IN CLASS AND THAT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS DATABASE. TO DOCUMENT INFORMATION AND THAT COULD BE. OURS MARKS ARE TATTOOS WHICH WE COULD USE FOR IDENTIFICATION. AND SENATOR BOAR JUST ASKED ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THEY ACCIDENTALLY BUT THAT THEIR BLONDE ANOTHER BURNETT. SO THOSE THINGS CAN BE UPDATED IN THE MISCELLANEOUS FIELD AS WELL SO WE CAN LIST THEM AS- YOU KNOW THE LAST KNOWN. DISCOVERS THAT WE HAD OF THEM WAS THAT THEY WERE A BLIND BUT MISCELLANEOUS FEEL WE COULD SAY AT TIMES SHOWS AS A BURNETT. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DOCUMENT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IF NEEDED. I'M AND WE CAN ALSO USE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING. THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. SO THEY ARE USING EXAMPLE OF pYOU KNOW MY- I AM FROM OUT OF STATE MY MOM MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT DENNIS TO USE. WELL WE CAN USE THINGS LIKE AN UPDATED DRIVER LICENSE TO GET INFORMATION. WE CAN ACTUALLY RUN THEIR ADAM CRIMINAL HISTORY TO SEE IF THERE'S AN UPDATED TATTOO LISTED FROM AT A MORE RECENT BOOKING. THE FAMILY MAY KNOW WHAT. I'M AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE I'D LIKE TO. EMPHASIZE IS WHEN OFFICERS ARE OUT DOING FIELD INTERVIEW CARDS ON THEIR DAILY PATROLS. WE CAN. IF THE PERSON WHO'S MISSING IS KNOWN TO OUR SYSTEM IT IN AN ARC INTERNAL DATABASE. SOMETIMES AS IF I CARDS HAVE MORE UPDATED INFORMATION. THEN THE FAMILY MAY HAVE ABOUT WITH THIS PERSON LOOKS LIKE NOW CHANGES TO. WAIT DID A LIVING OUT IN THE ELEMENTS. ANY TATTOO AND HIS CAR THINGS LIKE THAT. OR WHAT THEY WERE LAST SEEN CLOSE WEARING CLOTHING WEISS. SO WE CAN USE MULTIPLE SOURCES. AND TO SUPPORT IN ORDER TO GET THAT RECORD ACCURATE FOR THE INITIAL CLASS ENTRY. AND AN- AS- YOUR ADAM COUNTERPART WAS ASKING ABOUT. THE POPULAR BELIEF THAT AND IT'LL HAVE TO BE MISSING FORTY TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT COMES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE IF WE COULD DO SOME PUBLIC OUTREACH TO DISSUADE THAT RUMOR WE WORKED AT AT IN OUR CITY WHERE WE PUT OUT SOCIAL MEDIA BROADCASTING HEY THIS IS THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE. AND ANYTIME YOU HAVE CONCERN FOR A MISSING PERSON PLEASE YOU CALL US IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS CRITICAL AND WE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY IS THAT WHY IS THAT FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS A SENSITIVE EVEN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BACKTRACK WHERE PERSON SPEND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T HANG ON TO SURVEY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY WHITE BUTTON. REQUIRE BACK OVER IT AND A LOT OF THOSE CLUES GO COLD SO. THINGS LIKE. I AM. USE LPR WHICH IS THAT LICENSE PLATE READING DATABASE. SO THOSE RECORDS ARE HELD FOR. A FINITE NUMBER OF DAYS SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OKAY THIS PERSON MISSING IN THIS CAR AND IT'S TOO LATE AFTER THE FACT TO PULL UP THAT DATA BACKDATED COULD BE GONE THAT'S WHY THESE. MISSING PERSONS REPORT SHOULD BE MADE IN A TIMELY MANNER. CAN YOU ANSWER FOR AS HOW LONG THE LICENSE PLATE READER DATA IS MAINTAINED. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE I KNOW IT IT VARIES I AM. AND I BELIEVE IT CAN BE A NUMBER OF MONTHS BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER OF HITS THAT CAN BE NINETEEN PER PLATE SO I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU. CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO US HOW YOU'RE TRAINED BY POST. SURE SO AM I START MY DISPATCHING KERR BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. AND WHEN YOU GET YOUR INITIAL. I AM. POSTED STASHING CERTIFICATE THERE IS A SECTION THERE REGARDING MISSING PERSONS. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S PART OF YOUR INITIAL BASIC POST DISPATCHING COURSE. AND THEN AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMES OUT SUCH AS THERE'S A THERE'S A RECENT LAW THAT WAS CHANGED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. THOSE COME OUT IN THE DOJ BULLETINS AND COME OUT AS UPDATES AND THEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AND- A REQUIRED AMOUNT OF HOURS OF TRAINING THE DOJ AND A LOT OF THAT DOES REQUIRES MISSING PERSON AFTER THIS IS FILE. OKAY AND AS A DISPATCHER DO YOU HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH DOING ANY INPUT INTO THE CLOUDS DIRECTLY YOURSELF YES MA'AM SO AND MY CURRENT POSITION IS AND THE DISPATCH SUPERVISOR NOW BUT I WORKED AS AT LINE LEVEL DISPATCHER FOR MY CURRENT AGENCY FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS AND WE DO MAPS ENTRIES O A REGULAR BASIS. AND THE- ONCE THAT WE DO THE MOST OFTEN ARE THOSE REPEAT RUN AWAY FROM THE GROUP HOMES. AND THE REASON WHY I BRING TO LIGHT THE COMPLACENCY FACTOR REGARDING THE REPORTING OF THOSE JUVENILES IS BECAUSE- CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IT'S- IT'S ACTUALLY MORE DANGER SOME MORE OFTEN THEY GO MISSING. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S OUT OF CHARACTER THIS CHILD IS YOU KNOW A MODEL STUDENT STRAIGHT DAYS NEVER GONE MISSING BEFORE AN OFFICE AND THEY'RE GONE. THAT'S A CRITICAL MISSING. BUT THESE JUVENILES WHO LIVE IN THESE GROUP HOMES WHO ARE ESSENTIAL. ESSENTIALLY THROWAWAYS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE GIVEN UP ON THEM. THERE WERE TO THE COURT AND THEY'RE CHRONICALLY RUNNING AWAY AND THERE. THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD CONTINUES TO DWINDLE AS PEOPLE. BECOME COMPLACENT WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR THOSE ARE THE ONES AND UP IN THE RECEIVING HOME AND THOSE ARE THE ONES AND UP. BEING TRAFFICKED. AND SO THOSE AT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THOSE ENTRIES AS ACCURATELY AS WE CAN BECAUSE THEY DO HAPPENED SO OFTEN SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY YES I WAS AMAZED TO LOOK AT SOME FEDERAL STATISTICS AND STATE STATISTICS AS WELL AS- TO THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO. WENT MISSING WHO WERE WHO WERE RUNAWAYS AND HOW MANY WERE ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN TAKEN BACK OUT. BECAUSE THEY WERE FOUND IN AND THE NUMBER IS ASTOUNDING IT IS AND IT CAN BE. EXHAUSTIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S THE SAME KIDS OVER AND OVER MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. AND SO THAT WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD. CAUTION AGAINST IS AYE COMPLACENCY BOTH ON THE REPORTING PARTIES BEHALF AND ON THE INTERAGENCY. AND PERHAPS WHEN THAT IS OCCURRING PERHAPS THAT SHOULD TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING TO. ANOTHER ENTITY WHO CAN CAN COME IN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT. AT AS AN AD PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING LEVEL- JUST TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SOMEBODY THAT THEY KNOW HAS THAT HISTORY BUT- NOW WITH THE BEHAVIOR IS MAKING THEMSELVES. A GREATER TARGET FOR. BECOMING A PERMANENT MISSING PERSON DOWN THE ROAD. ABSOLUTELY I UNDERSTAND AS THE CITRUS HEIGHTS POLICE DEPARTMENT PARTNERS WITH PROJECT LIFESAVER CORRECT CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT PRIOR THAT PROGRAM FOR US I WOULD I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SO. I THINK EVERY PERSON THAT'S BEEN APT HERE HAS TALKED ABOUT A STORY THAT HAS BROUGHT THEM TO THIS TABLE. I'M AND SOMETIMES IN ORDER FOR REAL EFFECTIVE CHANGE BE MADE WE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE FAILURE. AND JUST LIKE. YOU KNOW THE AMBER ALERT SYSTEM WAS NAMED AFTER AN AMBER HAGERMAN. MY AT MY STORY WITH PROJECT LIFE THERE ARE STARTED WITH A MAN THAT WILL CALL VICTOR. SO VICTOR'S FAMILY WAS HISPANIC AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE BEST. RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT APPREHENSIVE TO CALL US IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M VICTOR Y. AS AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN HE WAS IN HIS SEVENTIES AND HE HAD SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. HE HAD DEMENTIA HE HAD A HEART CONDITION AND HE WAS DIABETIC THAT REQUIRED MEDICATION. AND VICTOR LIVED AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND IT THEY DID THEIR VERY BEST TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. ONE DAY VICTOR WENT MISSING I AM AND HIS FAMILY LOOK FOR HIM THE BEST THAT THEY COULD AND AFTER TWO HOURS THEY FINALLY CAME TO THE DECISION THAT THEY HAD TO CALL FOR HELP AS MUCH AS THEY WERE. SCARED TO DO SO. AND SO THEY DID SO WE ARE ALREADY TWO HOURS BEHIND. BEHIND THE TIME OF WHEN HE LAUGHED WHEN HE ELOPED. AND I WAS WORKING AS AT LINE LEVEL DISPATCHER THAT DAY AND WE THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD AT THIS CASE. WE DID EXACTLY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO THE CRITICAL MISSING WE DEPLOYED EVERY SINGLE AVAILABLE UNIT. TO THE POINT LAST SEEN WE SET UP A C. P. WE CIRCULATED THE AREA. AND WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. SO THEN WE DID THE NEXT THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS ASK FOR HELP RIGHT SO WE- CONTACTED OUR NEIGHBORING TERRACE DEPARTMENT WE ASK FOR AIR SUPPORT. WE ASK FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE. AND WE GOT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OUT THERE WE DID THE I OVER WE GOT THE DOGS OUT. AND WE COULDN'T FIND VICTOR. SO THEN WE HAD ANOTHER YOU. SHIFT OF OFFICERS COME ON AND WE TO PLAY THEM AS WELL NO WAY TO FULL SHIPS OF OFFICERS WE HAD TWO AIRSHIPS AB WE HAD SEARCH AND RESCUE OUT THERE THE DOGS. MEDIA STARTS TO SHOW UP AND STILL WE CAN'T FIND VICTOR WE SEARCH A LONG INTO THE NIGHT AND WE SEARCH FOR OVER EIGHTEEN HOURS AND I DID THE MATH ONE DAY. AND WE HAD UTILIZED OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE RESOURCES AND WE ENDED UP. LOSING THAT CALL FOR SERVICE WHAT. FINING HIM. AND I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT. FEELING LIKE AN ABJECT FAILURE. AND I REMEMBER CONTACTING MY PARTNER NICKY HIS HERE TODAY AND I REMEMBER SAYING TO HER. I FEEL LIKE WE FAILED AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND SO THAT PROMPTED US TO START LOOKING FOR. A SOLUTION AND HOW COULD WE PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING WE KNEW THAT VICTOR WAS AT RISK FOR WANDERING DUE TO HIS COGNITIVE DISORDER. AND SO WE'VE ADDED A COUPLE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE LANDED ON PROJECT LIFESAVER IS BEING THE BEST FIT FOR OUR PARTICULAR AGENCY. BECAUSE IT WAS NONPROFIT. IT WAS CREATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT HAD A- SIXTY THREE THAT WAS PROVEN OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. THERE WERE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE GPS BASED THAT WERE FLASH YEAR HAD NEWER TECHNOLOGY. BUT WE WERE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY REQUIRED. THE FAMILY MEMBERS TO PAY FOR A MONTHLY SERVICE FEE. AND THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE. THEY'RE WORKING CLASS CITIZENS AND WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY THAT IS SPENDING. ALL OF THE TIME THAT THEY COULD BE WORKING. CARING FOR A LOVED ONE THEY USUALLY 'T TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SPEND A MONTH FOR MONITORING SERVICE. SO WITH PROJECT LIFESAVER MY PARTNER NICK AND I WENT OUT AND WE SOLICITED. GRANTS WE AND FUND RAISING OUR COMMUNITY WE FIND REYES WITH OUR LOCAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS NO COST PROGRAM. TO OUR RESIDENTS IT HAS COST THE CITY ZERO DOLLARS AND IS COST THE CITIZENS HERE DOLLARS TO PARTICIPATE. I'M ARE THE BATTERIES FOR THE BAND THAT. DAYS AND WE HAVE A CADRE AMAZING VOLUNTEER THAT GOES OUT AND DOES THAT SERVICE FOR US SO IT DOES NOT TAKE ANY OF THE OFFICERS TIME DOES NOT TAKE. TIME AWAY FROM CSOS BEING OUT ON THE STREET FIELDING CALLS FOR SERVICE. AND HOW IT WORKS IS IT'S A RADIO FREQUENCY BASED LOCATING PROGRAM. IF THE SAME THING THAT- WILDLIFE TRACKERS USE WHEN THEY'RE- TRACKING WILDCATS ARE WOLVES LIKE OUT AND IN THE WILD. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LARGE CONTRAPTION ON THESE PEOPLE SO IT'S SMALLER. I'M AND SO USUALLY GOES EITHER ON THE ANKLE AT OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM. OR ON THE REST LIKE A WATCH FOR THE TEENS FOR THE ADULTS. AND IT EMITS AS SILENT RADIO FREQUENCY SIGNAL EVERY SIXTY SECONDS. THAT WE HAVE THE RECEIVERS TO AND MONITOR. SO IN THE EVENT NOW THAT ONE OF OUR PROJECT PLACE OF OUR CLIENTS BECAUSE MISSING WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM A SCRIPT. AND BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO CALL ME WHEN THEY'RE NERVOUS. IT'S NERVE WRACKING THEIR LOVED ONE IS GONE THEY THEY'RE WORRIED FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR- FOR EITHER THE CLIENT OTHER FAMILY MEMBER. AND SO WE PROVIDE THEM A SCRIPT THAT THEY CAN CARRY IN THEIR WALLET OR THE WE'VE MADE THEM A MAGNET THAT THEY CAN PUT ON ON THE FRIDGE. AND IT TELLS THEM EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY WHEN THEY CALL NINE ONE- INCLUDING THE FREQUENCY THAT IS UNIQUE TO THAT CLIENT. I WOULD LIKE A VERY SMALL DEMONSTRATION YES PLEASE OKAY. SO THIS IS LASSEN EIGHTY. THIS IS ADAM. WHAT THE RECEIVER LOOKS LIKE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY SIMPLE ALL IT IS JUST LIKE A RADIO RECEIVER LIKE YOU'D SEE BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. AND BUT THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE THIS IS BECAUSE THE TOP LOCKERBIE IN CITRUS HEIGHTS IS SUCH THAT WE HAVE LARGE OPEN GREEN SPACES WE HAVE SEVERAL MILES OF CREEK AREA BUT WE ALSO HAVE APARTMENT BUILDINGS IT'S A BEDROOM COMMUNITY FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN MEET FOR WORK. SO WE HAVE THESE HUGE APARTMENT COMPLEXES WE HAVE EIGHTY THE AM I EIGHTY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE CITY WE WANT THIS BILL TO WORK THROUGH CONCRETE WE WANT THIS TO WORK THROUGH STEEL AND THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE A RADIO BASED PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO A GPS PROGRAM. LESS EXPENSIVE IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE CHARGED EVERY TWELVE HOURS AND IT WORKS THROUGH ALL OF THESE. HERE'S THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE FOUND WITH A LOT OF THE GPS SOLUTIONS. WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP TAKING IT OFF OF THE CLIENT IN ORDER TO CHARGE IT OVERNIGHT. WELL WHEN THESE FOLKS. WONDER SOMETIMES IT'S DUE TO SUNDOWNERS IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT TERM HAM WITH FOLKS I HAVE DEMENTIA. AND SO THEN THEY HAVE TAKEN OFF THE DEVICE TO CHARGE IT AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THEY WONDER. OR WITH THE KIDS DOUBLE AND RAN AND IT'S LEFT ON THE CHARGING STATIONS WE WANTED THIS DEVICE TO NEVER COME OFF THEIR BODIES SO. THE ACTUAL TRANSMITTER THAT THEY WHERE IS AND WATER RESISTANT SO THEY CAN STILL DO THEIR WATER THERAPY THEY CAN SWIM THEY CAN BATHE AND IT STAYS ON THEIR PERSON. THE ONLY TIME WE TAKE OFF IS WHEN WE TO ABOUT AND WE PUT IT RIGHT BACK ON. WE'VE HAD BEEN RAMP. SEVEN YEARS. AND I'VE GROWN UP WITH IT SOME OF OUR LITTLE GUYS. AND THEN WE HAVE AND SOME OF OUR OLDER CLIENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE PROGRAM FOR A SHORTER TIME. AND IN THE NAY H. OUT OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL. SO MY PARTNER NIKKI IS WEARING ONE OF THE DEVICES ON A REST. AND BASICALLY ONCE YOU GET A SIGNAL. THE AVERAGE RECOVERY TIME WITH THIS DEVICE IS THIRTY MINUTES OR LESS. WHICH I A HUGE BECAUSE IT TAKES A SEARCH THAT THE AVERAGE SEARCH TIME FOR AN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT IS NINE HOURS. NATIONALLY AN AVERAGE. COST OF A SEARCHES FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUR WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. HOW MANY RESOURCES HERE UTILIZING. SO WITH THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE GOTTEN THAT SEARCH TIME FROM THE- FROM ONLY START THE SEARCH WITH THE EQUIPMENT TO THIRTY MINUTES OR LESS AND YOU ONLY NEED. THREE OFFICERS TO OPERATE AS YOU'RE NOT TO PLAN YOUR ENTIRE CADRE FOLKS NECESSARILY. COURSE OF THE CRITICAL MISSING WE STILL DO INITIALLY BUT- AND- SO THIS PLAN HAS TO BE ON A SIX BECAUSE THIS OPERATES ON A TWO ONE SIX MEGAHERTZ CHANNEL AND THESE LAST THREE BUTTONS HAVE TO BE ON THE UNIQUE FREQUENCY FOR THE CLIENTS EACH CLAN MEMBER HAS A UNIQUE THREE DIGIT FREE CONCERTS ASSIGNED TO THEM AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE SIGNAL IT'S REALLY LIKE PLAYING PONG COLD THE LOUDER THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU ARE. TICKETS CHOIR GOING THE WRONG. THAT'S HOW SIMPLE IT. BOB JUST PERFORMED. YOU HAD TO BE. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M LISTENING FOR IF I GO THIS WAY. IT GETS HIRED SOMEONE THE WRONG WAY. THEN A LOWLY TURN. YES NOW I KNOW THAT THIS WAY IS THE RIGHT PERSON YOU HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THE DELEGATE BUT DANCING SOMETHING THAT'S METAL IN THE ROOM BUT I KNOW THIS FOR. OUR HEY. AND IT JUST KEPT GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER. YEAH THAT MIGHT BE IN IT WHILE IS THE AYE WHILE IS A REQUIREMENT SO IT SMALL. AND IT IS IT'S SMALL AND IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND IT'S NOT BURDENSOME FOR THEM TO WEAR SOME OF THE CASES WE'VE ACTUALLY START ORDERING AND SOME FUN COLORS FOR THE CHILDREN AND THAT ARE AUTISTIC- HAVE DOWN SYNDROME OR DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY. SO THEY CAN CHOOSE A COLOR THAT THEY LIKE AND THEN THEY'RE MORE AT THAT LIKELY TO WEAR IT. AND WE HAVE SOME FABRIC BANDS LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE FOR OUR OLDER FOLKS WHO ARE IN CARE HOMES TO WEAR BECAUSE IN OTHER SKIN GETS VERY FRAIL THE ONE THAT IS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM TO WEAR. AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT A LOCKDOWN TREATMENT CENTER THAT SPECIALIZES IN MEMORY KERR THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WANDER. YOU'RE SURPRISED. THEY ARE SO CLEVER. AND I HAVE TO SMILE A BIT BECAUSE WE HAD A CLIENT AND- HER NAME IS DOROTHY AND I WAS VERY FOND OF HER. AND WE WOULD WATCH HER AND YOU IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF HER CAREFULLY YOU HAD TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE PUSH BUTTONS ON OPPOSING WALLS IN ORDER FOR THE FRONT DOORS TO OPEN. AND SHE WAS STAND THERE AND WAIT TO INTEREST WITH BY AND THEN SHE TRIED TO BRIBE. TO PUSH THE OTHER BUTTON. AND SHE ACTUALLY GOT OUT ONE TIME SHE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN WRITING SOME TO PUSH THE OTHER BUTTON SO SHE COULD. HELLO AND SHE WENT AND SHE FOUND AN UNLOCKED CURRENT SHE SAT IN IT. AS AN OFFICER CAME BY AND SAW HER AND KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW WAS LIKE. YOU KNOW DOROTHY ARE IS ARE YOU IN THERE SHE SAID. I KNOW THIS IS MY CAR I'M GOING TO WORK. AND YOU KNOW AND SHE WAS JUST VERY CLEVER SO EVEN WHEN THEY ARE. THE WALK DOWN MEMORY WAR IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THIS EXTRA LAYER PRECAUTION. AND FOR AND THAT HAVE THIS PROGRAM EVEN WHEN THEIR CHILD. AND WHAT WOULD SEND. BEEN A PART OF IT. IT'S AN ADDED WELFARE CHECK AND IT'S AN ADDED LAYER OF RESOURCES FOR US TO GIVE TO THAT FAMILY. THERE ARE A FEW THINGS- LONELIER THAN BEING A CAREGIVER. I THINK THOSE OF US WHO HAVE HAD CHILDREN AND NOTICE LIKE TO BE. THERE FOR LONG DAYS A SMALL CHILDREN THAT CAN BE MENTALLY TAXING. BUT TO THINK ABOUT DOING THAT FOR A PARENT WHOSE. HAS YOU KNOW THESE MOMENTS OF ANGER AND CONFUSION. IT BECOMES EVEN LONELIER STILLNESS STRETCHES OUT FOR YEARS THEY DON'T GROW OUT OF THAT PHASE LIKE A TODDLER DOES IT JUST PROGRESSES. AND WE'VE HAD OUR VOLUNTEERS GO OUT AND TO DO THESE BATTERY CHANGES AND IT'S BECOME KIND OF A SMALL WELFARE CHECK FOR THE FAMILY. JUST ASK HOW ARE YOU DOING DO YOU NEED RESPITE CARE TINO RESPITE CARE IS CAN WE GET YOU CONNECTED WITH AN OMBUDSMAN OR SOMEONE FROM SOCIAL WORK THAT COULD COME IN AND HELP YOU. AND WE'VE HAD TIMES WE'VE GONE OUT DURING THE HOLIDAYS AND THERE'S NO DECORATIONS SO WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE C. WILL WE FEEL SCARED TO GO OUT AND SHOP BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN MIGHT LEAD. AND WE WORK TOGETHER AS AN ORGANIZED INTO. THEM AT AT YES. SO IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS DESIGNED. TO ALLEVIATE THESE AT RISK MISSING PEOPLE. BUT IT'S BECOME. AN ADDED WAY FOR US TO CONNECT WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO AND THANK YOU FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT TO LESS AT A CERTAINLY I CAN SEE THE NEED FOR IT AND IT WOULD LOVE TO SEE EXPANDED. SELF CONGRATULATION FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU HAVE ANY. I CAME. NEXT WE HAVE BJ SPAMMER WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NAMYS AND SHE'S HERE FROM TEXAS SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR TRAVELING SO FAR TO BE WITH US TODAY AND SHE WILL GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE NATIONAL MISSING AN IDENTIFIED PERSON SYSTEM WHICH WE CONTINUE TO REFER TO HIS NAME IS AND SHE WILL DESCRIBE HOW IT ACCEPTS INFORMATION CONCERNING MISSING PERSONS AND DESCRIBE HOW CALIFORNIA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE MISSION OF NAME S. AND THE MOST EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR THE ENTRY OF MISSING PERSONS INTO THEIR DATABASE WELCOME AND THANK. THANK SENATOR GALGIANI OF SO HONORED HERE TODAY AND PART OF THIS DISCUSSION THANK YOU FOR THE WORK DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIS IMPORTANT IT AND TO GET AN OVERVIEW OF NAME S. OR THE NATIONAL MISS UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SYSTEM NAME THIS IS A PROGRAM OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE SO IT'S FULLY FUNDED BY A GRANT ISSUED BY AN AYE JAYE A I AM A KOREAN T. SO I ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS CENTER FOR HUMAN BENEFIT XIN OR WE CALL YOU ANTI HIV. YOU ANTI H. AT THE GRANDADDY THAT MANAGE THE DAY PARADE CONSERVE NAMYS ACE TECHNOLOGY JUST ALL GIVE YOU AN SOME OF THE NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT BEHIND THE SISTER. NAME IS. SUPPORT FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE DEATH OR pWE HAVE SOME GENEROUS SUPPORT FROM THE OFFICE FOR VICTIMS OF CRIME. THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO STEP UP THAT VICTIM SERVICES UNIT I MEAN WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A PEER TO PEER SUPPORT NETWORK SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN THAT PLACE EMOTIONALLY THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT OTHER FAMILY. WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE- LOVED ONE. H. THOSE THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH PEER MENTORS WE ALSO PROVIDE VICTIM REUNIFICATION SERVICES. SO IF MISSING LOVED ONE IS FOUND DECEASED WE HAVE SOME FUNDING THAT CAN SUPPORT. REUNIFYING THAT FAMILY SO SOMETIMES EVEN EXHUMATIONS TRANSPORTATION REINTERMENT OF THOSE REMAINS. SO FAMILIES CAN BRING THEM BACK FOR PROPER BURIALS. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF SERVICES BEHIND THE DATABASE TECHNOLOGY NONE OF THEM ARE DESIGNED TO BE A REPLACEMENT FOR EXISTING LOCAL OR STATE RESOURCES. THEY'RE THERE TO FILL THE GAPS THAT OF THEIR THEIR FOR AGENCIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. OF COURSE WE IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS AN EXCELLENT LABORATORY THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE PROFILES ALL OF DNA SAMPLES. FOR FAMILIES OF MISSING PERSONS WHO WERE LAST% SEEN IN CALIFORNIA SO. IN THOSE CASES WE DON'T PROVIDE THE DIRECT. ANALYSES SERVICES WE CAN HELP COORDINATE DNA COLLECTIONS MAYBE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. TO GET THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY BE NO LONGER LIVE IN THE STATE. COLLECTED WITH THE CAL DOJ KIDS AND RETURN TO THE LABORATORY. SETTLING TO THE DATABASE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES NAME IS TRULY UNIQUE. NOW OF COURSE THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS ONLY VIEWABLE TO ARE VETTED REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL USERS. LIKE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT USERS MEDICAL EXAMINERS CORNERS. SO THERE ARE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THAT INFORMATION THAT'S ONLY VISIBLE TO THOSE PROFESSIONAL USERS BUT FAMILY MEMBERS VICTIM ADVOCATES. JUST BETTER WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC DO YOU HAVE A CLOSE TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF. IN NAME. HELPS TO THE SYSTEM. WHICH PERFORM COMPARE. WE HAVE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS SIT DOWN TO THE KEYBOARD AND SEARCH NAY MISS AND FIND A MATCH TO THEIR MISSING LOVED ONE. I CAN THINK OF. NOT POWERING. THANKS FOR. THEM WE HAVE OTHER SISTER A MAN WHO HAD BEEN MISSING FROM THE CITY JERRY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS MR HAD BEEN MISSING. SHE HEARD ABOUT THE NAME IS STAFF ACE LOGGED IN FRANCE SEARCHES OF THE AND I DE I JUST. THIS AN HERS AND- MIDWAY THE CASE RESULT CALLED ON A CASE. THE CASE FILE NAME IS OPENED SHE'S A COMPOSITE IN HIS SHE SOUGHT FOR MAY ABOUT TATTOO AND SHE SAID HE- REALLY. SHE WAS HER SISTER PAUL. HOW ONE OF THE IS THAT WE FIND IN THESE QUE IS TEN. SOME OF THE MEDITATOR NOT BE CORRECT SO NOT FOR HUMAN ERROR SOME IT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE INFORMATION THAT WAS KNOWN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE TIME OF THE ENTRY AND THAT PARTICULAR CASE PAUL WAS NOT. WHO DIDN'T LIVE AT HOME SO BY THE TIME SHE WENT MISSING NO ONE REALIZE SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN MISSING FOR SEVERAL DAYS SO HER DATE OF LET CONTACT. WAS ENTERED INTO DATABASES AS BEING SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE HER BODY WAS ACTUALLY FOUND. BUT THE SISTERS SEARCHING FOR JUST DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IN THE NAME IS DATABASE WAS OVER TO. ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT CHALLENGE. AND THERE ARE SO MANY NUANCES TO THESE CSES AND SO MANY CHALLENGES WE COULD TALK ALL DAY ABOUT THOSE. BUT I THINK SUCH AN EMPOWERING TOOL TO HAVE. SO MANY PEOPLE OPERATING IN ONE SYSTEM TO HELP LOCATE THESE CASES AND BRING THESE LOVED ONES HOME. SO THE NAME IS DATABASE STORES MADE ON MISSING PERSONS. UNIDENTIFIED DECEDENTS AND ALSO UNCLAIMED PERSONS SO THESE ARE DECEDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NAME BUT FOR HOME NEXT OF KIN HAS NOT YET BEEN LOCATED TO MAKE. THAT BUT IF OCCASIONS OR HAVE THOSE BODIES CLAIM FOR BURIAL CURRENTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX OF THOSE UNCLAIMED BODIES IN THE NAME IS DATABASE. AND WE JUST WRKED WITH SAN BERNADINO COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE TO IMPORTS A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES INTO NAME IS SO THAT THEY COULD START UTILIZING THAT SYSTEM MORE. LEAVE MAKING GAVE I'M SITTIN ON THE MISSING PERSONS ALREADY WE HAVE ALMOST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PUBLISHED MISSING PERSON CASES IN NAME S. AS OF TODAY. AND ON THE ON IDENTIFIED DECEDENT SIDE WE HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CASES CAN YOU GIVE US THOSE NUMBERS AGAIN I'M SORRY MA'AM. ON THE MISSING PERSON SIDE WE HAVE ALMOST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THESE ARE THE PUBLISHED ASUS SO THESE OF ALL BEEN VETTED. WE HAVE PERMISSION OF THE INVESTIGATING AGENCIES TO PUBLISH THOSE IN OUR SYSTEM. ON THE IDENTIFIED TO SEE INSIDE WE HAVE CURRENTLY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS IN NAME IS FROM CALIFORNIA. THE UNCLAIMED PERSONS WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX AND THAT JUST FROM CALIFORNIA YES MA'AM. AT THE SAME TWENTY FIVE PUBLISHED IS JUST FROM CALIFORNIA AS WELL JUST FROM CALIFORNIA'S. SHOULD WA. OVER SEVEN THAT THOUSAND. ACTIVE MISS PURSING. THE US VICE WE HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND CASES. NO ONE OF THE PRIME PUSHES THE CREATION OF NEW IS K. FROM THE EXAMINER. COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE HAD AGENCIES WHO WERE TASKED WITH IDENTIFYING REMAINS WHO HAD VERY LITTLE TOOLS AT THEIR DISCRETION TO DO SO. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CENTRAL DATABASE THAT THEY COULD ALL ACCESS 80% OF OUR MEDICAL EXAMINERS IN CORNERS IN THE UNITED STATES RARELY OR NEVER USE NCIC. MAJORITY HAVE NO ACCESS TO NCIC SO THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR OTHER STATE AGENCIES. TO ENTER THAT WAS ON IDENTIFIED CASES FOR THEM. THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN IS THAT THEN THEY HAVE NO DIRECT ACCESS TO SEARCH FOR A MISSING PERSON MATCHES. FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CORONER COMMUNITY WAS A LARGE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE INITIAL ROLLOUT OF NAME AS OUR FIRST SECTION OF THE DATABASE THAT WENT LIVE WAS ON IDENTIFIED DECEDENTS. AND TODAY THOSE. THIRTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX AND IDENTIFY CASES THAT WE HAVE NATIONWIDE. FOR PASSES NUMBER OF DECEIT BETTER IN AND THE ICY BECAUSE OF THAT ACCESS. ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WITH NAME S. IT IS A VERY UNIQUE SYSTEM INCORPORATES EVERYONE INTO ONE DATABASE. SO WE DO ALLOW ANYONE TO MAKE AN INITIAL MISSING PERSON REPORT TO NAME S. SO ANYONE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN REGISTER FOR PUBLIC ACCOUNT. AND CREATE A BRAND NEW MISSING PERSON CASE NOW THAT INFORMATION WILL NEVER BE VIEWABLE TO ANYONE OTHER THAN INTERNAL NAME IS STAFF. UNTIL OUR STAFF HAVE VETTED THAT CASE WITH THE PROPER JURISDICTIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE OF COURSE WE WANT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND THE SAFETY. OF INDIVIDUALS REPORTED MISSING TO NAME THIS SO WILL REACH OUT TO THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY WILL VERIFY THAT THEY DO HAVE A MISSING PERSON REPORT ON FILE SOMETIMES THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT REPORT. THAT AND WE CAN HELP THAT FIT ONLY MAKE BACK ACTION. PROPER INVEST. OR AGENCY TO. REPORT ONCE THAT AGENCY HAS REVIEWED ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE NAME IS CASE FILE TO MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE. IT'S COMPLETE AND IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC VIEWING THEY'LL GIVE US PERMISSION AND WILL PUBLISH THAT CASE IN OUR SYSTEM. ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER. I'M YES SOMETHING DOES COME TO MIND SO RICK G. ANY WHO WAS FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY AND HIS WIFE CAME FORWARD WHEN THE EVENTS OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT AND SHE BELIEVE THAT HER HUSBAND HER EX HUSBAND'S WOMEN REMAINS WERE. IN THE- LET TRY TO AMEND TO THE STATES THE DOJ MAP SYSTEM BUT WE LEARNED THAT THERE WAS NEVER A MISSING PERSON REPORT FILED AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU KNOW IF HE WAS ESTRANGED FROM HIS WIFE AND HIS SON WAS ONLY TEN YEARS OLD THE EX WIFE IS STAYING THAT THIS THE SUN IS AVAILABLE AND WILLING TO PROVIDE THE AND THEN WE LEARNED THAT. WAS NO EVEN ENTERED. THERE WAS NO MISSING. FIVE IN A CASE LIKE THAT IS THERE A RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OF YOU KNOW HOW THE HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ANY TT TO TRY TO LOCATE A FAMILY MEMBER. YES AND WE DO THAT COMMONLY SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MEDICAL EXAMINERS CORNER USERS. IN THE NAME A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW SO WHEN A FAMILY REPORTS TO NAME MISS AND THERE'S NOT A MISSING PERSON REPORT ON FILE ALREADY WE CAN OFTEN REACH OUT TO ONE OF THOSE CONTACT THAT'S ALREADY IN THE NAME IS NETWORK. SO THEY'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHALLENGES FACING PERSON CASES WE CAN REACH OUT TO THEM TO HELP THAT FAMILY GET A REPORT FILED. OUR ANALYTICAL DID. ALSO PROVE. PORTAL ON FORCE. LOCATE THOSE FAMILY FIRST. BECAUSE OFTEN WE RECEIVED VERY LONG TERM CASES IN NAME IS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I MENTION THAT IN THE BEGINNING STAGES 95% OF THE CASES THAT ARE REPORTED TO NAME S. ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MISSING ONE YEAR OR MORE. WHAT A LOT OF AGENTS MIGHT DEEM A COLD CASE AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT DEFINITIONS OF COLD CASES. FOR ME THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE POOR STATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. AND THEY FEAR THAT FELL PLAYS IT HEARD IN THERE LOOKING TO COMPARE THAT MISSY PERSON. IDENTIFY DECEIT. SO WE HAVE STAFF MEMBERS BY. THE NAME IS SYSTEM THAT WE CALL REGIONAL PROGRAM SPECIALISTS. OR OUR P. S.'S. THESE ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF MISSING AN UNIDENTIFIED THAT SERVICE. REALLY A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR THE AGENCIES THAT WORK WITH NAMYS. SO THEY'RE AN EXTRA SET OF EYES THERE AN EXTRA BEST TO GET OF SUPPORT TO THE AGENCIES. THAT CAN HELP THEM TRACK DOWN THOSE FAMILY. FIRST AND EVEN FACILITATE THOSE THE IN COLLECTIONS SOMEONE MISSING IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT HAVE A RELATIVE IN MARYLAND. WE HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR IN MARYLAND THAT WE CAN REACH. THE FACILITY THAT DNA COLLECTION. SO WHAT IF FAMILY MEMBER WE- THAT THERE MISSING ONE IS THE SYSTEM. AND THEY'VE MOVED AND THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION HAS CHANGED. DOES THE SYSTEM HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE FAMILY MEMBER TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM AGAIN AND MAKE A CHANGE IN UPDATE THEIR CURRENT CONTACT INFORMATION. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO FAMILY MEMBERS IF THEY MAKE THE PRIMARY ENTRY INTO NAME S. WHEN THEY HIT THAT DO YOU CASE BUTTON TO CREATE A CASE FILE THEY WILL SEE EVERY FIELD IN THE NAME OF SYSTEM. SO THEY CAN ENTER EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR MISSING LOVED ONE INCLUDING THEIR OWN CONTACT INFORMATION. NOW ONCE THE CASE IS ACCEPTED INTO NAME AS THE VIEW WILL CHANGE TO A PUBLIC NEED LEAVE. AND SOME OF THAT IN FOR. LONG SPENT MIGHT BECOME BACK IN ADDING TO THAT ENTRY THAT THE ONLY CREATED LAW ENFORCEMENT MY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL SENT. FOR ME THE AND IS THE- PUBLIC VIEWING. SO WHY THANK CASES X. THE FOR MEMBER STILL HAS PUBLIC ACCESS TO THEIR CASE FILE AND THEY HAVE A POINT OF CONTACT THAT'S LISTED RIGHT ON THEIR NAME IS CASE FILE. FOR THE REGIONAL PROGRAM SPECIALIST SO THEY CAN REACH BACK IF THEY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. OR UPDATED INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS PUBLICLY VIEWABLE SYSTEM. IS WE OFTEN HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WILL Q. A THEIR OWN CASE FILE AND THEY WILL CALL US TO SAY YOU DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT TOO. OR THAT PIECE OF JEWELRY THAT SHE ALWAYS WORE SOMETIMES FAMILY GIVING US ADDITIONAL NATION THAT WE KNOW ABOUT BEFORE. AND THAT'S- FINE FOR SOMEONE FOR MEMBER HIS WAITED FOR SO MANY YEARS AND THERE'S LEV ONE STILL MISSING TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO. ACCESS THINKPAD INFORMATION. UPDATE THAT MEANS MORE THAN THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE IT ABSOLUTELY DOES BECAUSE WE HEAR FROM FAMILIES WHO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN. OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OFTEN HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN MISSING FOR DECADES. AND THEY DON'T GET REGULAR UPDATES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO REGULAR UPDATES TO PROVIDE THERE'S NOTHING NEW. FOR LAWN FORCED TO SHARE WITH THAT FAMILY BUT THEY CAN LOG INTO THAT NAME IS SYSTEM ANYTIME. AND THEY CAN REVIEW THEIR OWN CASE THEY CAN SEARCH FOR POTENTIAL MATCHES IN THE NIGHT OF FIGHTS WE CAN HAD VICTIM ADVOCATES MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. NO STANDING IN A KILLER CASE WHO RUN THE SEARCHES AND ARE ABLE TO COME UP WITH COMPARISONS. HAVE LED TO I'D NOW THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY COMPARE MISSED. THIS TO A DENTAL TO SEE. ON THE- SUB OF CRITERIA SO. JEAN RATE THIS DE SAC HIGH EIGHT BUT ALSO. SOME EVER BEEN XIN IT SAYS SEARCH. SO FAR A MISSED. ONE WITH THE RAY TATTOO. I CAN DO A WORDS FOR ROAST. I CAN LOOK FOR THAT TIMEX WATCH I CAN LOOK FOR THAT SHOE SIZE OR THAT NAME BRAND OF CLOTHING THAT I KNEW THEY WERE WEARING. HIS SEARCH FOR SCARS MARKS TATTOOS ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS SEARCHABLE TO THE PUBLIC. CAN'T PUBLIC MEMBER KNOW WHETHER THERE IS DNA ON FILE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE WE DO NOT PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION PUBLICLY AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT. THE FIRST IS WE HAVE A LOT OF CASES WHERE MAYBE FAMILY MEMBERS AREN'T IN CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SO FOR PRIVACY REASONS WE DON'T DISCLOSE THAT THIS RELATIVE GAVE DNA VERSES THIS RELATIVE WHO DID NOT. THE OTHER REASON WE THERE USED TO BE MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN NAME IS THAT. BASICALLY JUST THE DNA IS AVAILABLE OR IS NOT AVAILABLE. WHAT WE FOUND IS WHEN THE VICTIM ADVOCATE COMMUNITY WAS RUNNING SEARCHES THROUGH NAME IS FOR POTENTIAL MATCHES THEY WERE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS THAT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM SAYS DNA IS AVAILABLE I DON'T NEED TO REPORT THIS TIP. BECAUSE DNA WOULD HAVE MADE THE MATCH. THAN IN A IS AVAILABLE BUT- AS THEIR ASSUME NEW. THESE WILL MATCH. DNA IS NOT ALWAYS GOING TO PRODUCE AN ASSOCIATION. WE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH FAMILY FRIEND SAMPLES WE NEED TWO OR MORE CLOSELY RELATED FAMILY MEMBERS FOR EVERY MISSING PERSON CASE. SURE THE PROPER SEARCHING IS HAPPENING IN CODIS NEED TO MAKE SURE NUCLEAR AND CON THE IS. SOME MY HAVE ONLY TROPHY PRINT EIGHT AT THE BECAUSE THE DECEDENT. UP WHO IDENTIFIED IS THE- WEEK GET A TEN FINGER CARD SO ALL OF NEW. TO THE BIOMETRIC DATE. MAKE IT WRITTEN FOR THE SUBJECT EXT BEHIND SYSTEM TO VALUE EIGHT. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY THAT SIX INFORMAL AND WHAT TERM RESOURCE ESPECIALLY SENSE ON THE PUBLIC IN FAMILY MEMBERS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM YES MA'AM AND THE ONLY OTHER THING I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IS WE ARE- WE HAVE DEVOTED A LOT OF RESOURCES IN THIS LAST YEAR TO ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE DATA IMPORTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HEARD TALKED ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT HAS BEEN A MANUAL PROCESS CENTER CASES INTO NAME AS- WE'VE NOW COMPLETED THE WORK TO ALLOW A FRONT END USER TO UPDATE. A SPREAD SHEET OR A CSP YEAR AJAY'S ON FILE OF CASE DATA INTO NAMYS AND WE'RE NOW WORKING ON THE SERVER TO SERVER DATA IMPORTS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US A BIT OF TIME BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE WITHIN THIS NEXT CALENDAR WILL HAVE THAT WERE COMPLETE AS WELL THAT'S GREAT NEWS. GOODNESS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WAITING FINALLY WE WILL BRING UP KEVIN PAPPA NO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR WITH THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DESCRIBE HIS TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE WITH THE HANDLING OF MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATIONS AND HOW CASES ARE HEADED FOR THE POLICE OFFICER TO THE DETECTIVE FOR FOLLOW UP. AND THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY REVEREND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. OF A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON MY EXPERIENCE I TOOK OVER MISSING PERSONS FOR THE CONTRACT CITY OF ELK GROVE WHEN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DECENTRALIZED MISSING PERSONS UP UNTIL THAT POINT THEY HAD. ONE DETECTIVE WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF MISSING PERSONS FOR THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT. AND FRANKLY THE GUIDELINES SAID TO ME NO IF YOU HAVE A MISSING PERSON CALL THIS GUY AND THEN HE WAS LEAVING SO. WHEN THEY DECENTRALIZED- AND DECEIVE OVER WAS JUST STARTING UP AS A CONTRACTED GETTING READY TO START THEIR OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT. I DID SOME- RESEARCH INTO. THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THE TIME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND FOLLOW UP. AND DEVELOPED A SYSTEM THAT WAS EVENTUALLY TAKEN- DEPARTMENT WIDE THROUGH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SO THAT EVERY. INDIVIDUAL STATION HOUSE WAS ON THE SAME PAGE- FOLLOWING. THE SAME GUIDELINES TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS WEREN'T WEREN'T FALLING THROUGH THE HOLES. AS WE HAD FOUND OUT THAT. QUITE A BIT THAT THERE WERE- AT THAT TIME. DETECTIVE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT ON EVERY MISSING PERSON CASE. IT HAS DEVELOPED NOW AS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF THE RESOURCES- THEN IT WOULD BE A DETECTIVETHAT WOULD HAVE TO CALL OF SEARCH AND RESCUE. THAT WOULD BRING OUT THE VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES- AND RESOURCES- DOES HAVE. I DON'T WANNA SAY PUSH DOWN BUT HAS BECOME COMMON NOW THAT. THAT INITIAL SEARCH WHEN SOMEBODY'S REPORTED MISSING THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS IF IT'S A GROUND SEARCH FOR AN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT OR- ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT IS HANDLED BY PATROL THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE ABILITY. TO FOLLOW FOLLOW THOSE LEADS PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND- THE ROLE OF DETECTIVE BASICALLY HAS GONE TO WHERE- WE- GET INVOLVED IN THE CASE OR TAKE OVER THE CASE WHEN. ONE OF TWO THINGS HAPPENS THAT INITIAL SEARCH COMES UP EMPTY AND THINGS ARE GOING TO TURN LONG TERM WHERE. THE INVESTIGATION TURNS INTO. ESSENTIALLY A SEARCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD- AND USING INVESTIGATIVE DATABASES AND MANY OF THE SOURCES NAY MISS- THAT TO BE ONE. TO TRY AND LOCATE THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY TURN UP SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO WHEN IT'S JUST GONE LONG TERM. THE OTHER WAY THE DETECTIVES GET INVOLVED IS AT FROM THE OUTSET IF IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S A CRIME INVOLVED SO IN OBJECTION. A KIDNAPPING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WERE IT APPEARS TO BE A CRIME FROM THE BEGINNING- THAT'S WHERE A DETECTIVE IDEALLY IS IN CHARGE OF FROM THE OUTSET OF THE- OF THE CASE. AND DIRECTING ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RESOURCES TO- INTO USE IN THE INVESTIGATION APPROPRIATELY. AND DIRECTING- CANVASES- NEIGHBORHOOD AREA CAMPUSES- IN A VERY DETAILED FASHION. BECAUSE THE SEARCHES NOW MORE THAN LOOKING FOR. THE MISSING PERSON THE SEARCHES DEAD TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE THAT MAY BECOME IMPORTANT AT SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE. SO THAT WAS BASICALLY THE TWO WAYS THAT- INVESTIGATORS AS A DETECTIVE NOW GETS INVOLVED IN- A MISSING PERSON CASE. SO ONCE IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THEM THE MISSING PERSON HAS. THERE APPEARS TO BE A CRIME. AT THAT POINT IT WOULD HOW WOULD YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO ENSURE THAT THAT THERE IS FAMILIAL DNA ON FILE FOR A MISSING PERSON. WELL SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED THAT YOU WORK WITH THEM TO VERIFY WELL IN SPEAKING- JUST JUST TO CLARIFY MIKE MY CURRENT ROLE IS AS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATOR WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THAT'S BEEN THE LAST TWO YEARS- PRIOR TO THAT I SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS AS A DETECTIVE WITH THE SECOND A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE OLD GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO KIND OF WHAT I'M SPEAKING FROM IS THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- DETECTIVE POINT OF VIEW- AS TO HOW WE WOULD WE WOULD HANDLE THOSE CASES- IN ANY MISSING PERSON CASE- FROM THE OUTSET YOU KNOW WE INFORM THE- FAMILY THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS TO SUBMIT. DNA AND THAT'S A RIGHT AND GO DO THAT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS HOWEVER IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME AND IT'S SUCH A CHILD ABDUCTION OR SOMETHING WE'VE- YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT ABOUT TWO. TIMES X. AND BECOME LESS LIKELY THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND A LIVING VICTIM- IT CAN BE YOU KNOW IT IS OUR PREROGATIVE RIGHT UP FRONT TO ASK PEOPLE TO VOLUNTEER THAT. BERMAN SAID DETECTIVES POINT OF VIEW AND TO QUESTION EVERYTHING A LOT OF MISSING PERSON CASES ARE HOMICIDES AND THE MISS TEEN. THE PERSON REPORTING THE MISSING PARTY IS ACTUALLY THE SUSPECT. AND THAT IS AND I THINK WHY IN TRAINING MISSING PERSON TRAINING A LOT OF IT- IT GOOD FOCUSES. TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSET WHETHER YOUR PATROL OFFICER OR DETECTIVE- FROM THE OUTSET HAS AN INVESTIGATION AND TO. HAVE A IN ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE PERSONALLY AT THE MISSING PERSON WHEN THE REPORT IS MADE. REFERENCING BACK A WELL PUBLICIZED CASE THAT WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM WAS THE SCOTT PETERSON CASE. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR PURPOSES OF EFFICIENCY AT SOME POINTS HAS GOTTEN TO WHERE- WILL TAKE A MISSING PERSON REPORT VIA FAX OR OVER THE PHONE- IN THAT CASE. HAVING SOMEBODY THERE THAT SHOWED UP TO TAKE THE MISSING PERSON REPORT WAS ABLE TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE SOME THINGS THAT WERE OUT OF PLACE IN THINGS THAT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN USED TO. CLEAN SOMETHING UP AND DIDN'T MAKE SENSE- YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SEEN SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE WHETHER DETECTIVE WERE IN THAT CASE. YOU KNOW IT'S A PATROL OFFICER IT'S COMING OUT TO TAKE THE REPORT. WE TALKED. THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT THE GROUP HOMES AND REPEATED RUN AWAYS OVER AND OVER. AS WELL AS ADDRESSING. THE RISK OF THESE REPEATED RUN AWAYS. AND ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW WE STARTED. INITIALLY WHEN I WAS. RUNNING THE SYSTEM AN OUTGROWTH. IS THAT WE- IF THERE WAS REPEATED RUN AWAY AS- WE SAID A NUMBER AND WHENEVER ON THREE TIMES WE REFER TO OUR YOUTH SERVICE OFFICERS. TO YOU KNOW MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT FAMILY THAT GROUP HOME WHATEVER IT IS. AND TRY AND FIND OUT WHY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. I AM. AND YEAH I'D I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE'RE- AND YOU KNOW SPEAKING ABOUT. GROUP HOMES THEY CAN FAX IN A REPORT. TO SAY THIS PERSON'S MISSING AND SO DISPATCHERS IN THE SYSTEM WE'VE CHECKED THE BOXES WITH BETTER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THEY CALL AND SAY OKAY CAME BACK ALL RIGHT GREAT WE MEAN EARLY REQUIREMENTS AND TAKE IT OUT. BUT WE NEVER HAVE. A YOU KNOW A COP. GO THERE AND LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. IN THAT HOME AND- AND TRY AND- TRY AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN JUST MEETING THE CHECKLIST. I WOULD SAY THAT THE SACRAMENTO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS JUST BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF LINKING. DNA WITH CASES AND IT. HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB WITH THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER AND OTHERS- WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. IS THERE MORE THAT YOUR OFFICE IS DEALING WITH IT IN YOUR VIEW COULD BE DONE TO. UTILIZE THE THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY TO DO MORE TO IDENTIFY. IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND ABSOLUTELY- AND WHEN. AND MARIE SCHUBERT FOUND OUT I WAS COMING HERE SHE CERTAINLY MADE IT. WANTED ME TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT SHE'S MORE THAN HAPPY TO- TO WORK WITH THE- THE COMMISSION ANYBODY ANYBODY THAT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE- IT AS GROWING- DAY BY DAY THAT SISTER. I'M FORTUNATE BE ASSIGNED IN THE HOMICIDE UNIT- AND TO THE EASTER RAPIST CASE. AND THE PEOPLE THAT LED THAT AND CRACKED THAT CASE ARE GETTING JUST INUNDATED- DAILY WITH. A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND WHATEVER THEIR CRIME IF THEY HAVE SOME DNA IT CERTAINLY- IS A IS A CANDIDATE. TO BE LOOKED AT FROM THE INVESTIGATIVE GENETIC GENEALOGY PERSPECTIVE. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO AS FAR AS THE- IDENTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION OF REMAINS. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE THAT THE STATE COULD BE DEALING SHOULD BE DEALING TO GIVE YOU BETTER TOOLS THAT ARE RESOURCES TO TAKE BETTER ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. I CAN'T X. SPECIFICALLY TO IT- OTHER THAN IT NEEDS IT NEEDS TO BE ENCOURAGE I THINK TRAINING TRAINING IS- IS HUGE I KNOW- YOU KNOW MY SUPERVISOR IS TRAVELING A LOT TOO- AROUND THE STATE OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES TO- TO TRAIN THEM ON THIS SO I THINK- ADDING IT IN TO THE MISSING PERSON TRAINING WHICH IS PROBABLY ON GOING I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT'S A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN SAN DIEGO TODAY. BUT YOU KNOW OTHER THAN ENCOURAGING THAT THE RESOURCES RIGHT NOW- SEEM TO BE OUT THERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. AND DEVELOPING FURTHER DEVELOPING THE GUIDELINES TO WORK WITH- YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS- PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT THE- AND THE GENEALOGY ORGANIZATIONS. HAS YOUR OFFICE PARTICIPATED IN THE MISSING PERSON EVENTS THAT THE CALIFORNIA DOJ HAS DESCRIBED THAT THEY'VE PUT ON IN THE PAST I DON'T KNOW I'VE BEEN THERE TWO YEARS AND I'M LIKE SAY SIGNED TO HOMICIDE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THE THOSE EVENTS OKAY I WAS GOING TO ASK WHAT THAT EXPERIENCE WAS AND IF IT WAS HELPFUL- TO THE TO INDIVIDUAL CASES AND HOW THAT WORKED RIGHT YEAH FROM FROM THE DESCRIPTION I CAN. CERTAINLY SEE IT- IT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE A HELPFUL WHEN A GOOD VENUE- BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF OKAY. WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND JOINING US I'M SORRY MY OTHER TWO COLLEAGUES HAD TO LEAVE FIVE SIR I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD SOME QUESTIONS. AS WELL BUT WE REALLY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. TO WORK WITH YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU AT THIS POINT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS IF THERE IS A PUBLIC COMMENT. MY QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO AHEAD AND ADJOURNED THE MEETING THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO IS HERE TODAY THANK YOU.
