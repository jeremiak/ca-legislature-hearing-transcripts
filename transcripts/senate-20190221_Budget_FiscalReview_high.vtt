00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.214
SENATORS --

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.517
I AM NEW TO THIS MODEL IS WITH

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.686
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:40.286
AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR STAFF

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:40.853
THIS MORNING WE WILL PROVIDE

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.454
INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.155
THAT ONE PUTS THE STATE'S

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:42.689
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.023
CHALLENGES IN CONTEXT.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.491
BUT ALSO SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:47.527
RECENT MAJOR ACTION IN THIS

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.163
SPACE AND THIRD IDENTIFIES SOME

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.364
POSSIBLE RESPONSES THAT ARE

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.132
BEING CONSIDERED BY THE

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.467
LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.336
I WILL BE REFERRING TO THIS HAND

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.137
OUT DURING THE COURSE OF MY

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:58.871
COMMENTS.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.807
AND SO IF YOU WILL TURN TO PAGE

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.408
ONE I WILL BE BECAUSE I WILL

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.109
BEGIN BY DISCUSSING PERCENT

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.012
ATTENTION DRIVERS TO THE STATE

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.214
HIGH HOUSING COSTS.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:08.982
SO WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE A

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.450
ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.785
STATE'S HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:16.789
MOST IMPORTANT IS THE

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:17.824
SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF HOUSING

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.324
PARTICULARLY IN COASTAL

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.325
COMMUNITIES.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.493
TODAY AN AVERAGE HOME IN THE

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.127
STATE COST ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:25.131
TIME AND RENTS ARE ABOUT 50%

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:25.698
HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.400
NATION.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.335
HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS BUILT

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.237
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:33.940
THOUSAND HOMES EACH YEAR --

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.575
WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:37.510
FIGURE ON PAGE ONE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.512
LAGS NATIONAL TRENDS IN COASTAL

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.315
COMMUNITIES.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.984
SO ALTHOUGH THE EXACT NUMBER OF

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.419
HOUSING UNITS THAT CALIFORNIA

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.154
NEEDS TO BUILD A TO ADDRESS THE

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.789
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.757
ON CERTAIN.

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:52.225
THE GENERAL MAGNITUDE IS

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.260
ENORMOUS IF YOU TURN TO THE

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.229
SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.296
OUTLINED SOME OF OUR PRIOR

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.132
RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.367
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BUILD ABOUT

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.102
TWICE AS MUCH HOUSING AS IT

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.771
CURRENTLY DOES EACH YEAR. TO

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.506
MEET DEMAND TO THAT MEANS IN

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.640
ORDER TO SORT OF CATCH UP WITH

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.008
THE SHORTFALLS IN PRIOR YEARS

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.144
THE STATE NEEDS OVER THREE

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.612
MILLION HOUSING UNITS.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.213
AND LASTLY ON THIS PAGE WE

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.782
DISCUSS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.250
PRODUCTION OVER THE LAST TWENTY

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.785
YEARS WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.219
HISTORICALLY HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.155
JUST A VERY SMALL PORTION OF ALL

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.356
AND YOU HOUSING BUILT IN THE

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:27.393
STATE ANNUALLY.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.227
IN THE NEXT SECTION OF THE

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.263
HANDOUT BEGINNING ON PAGE THREE

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.731
WE DISCUSS AFFORDABILITY

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.166
CHALLENGES MANY HOUSEHOLDS IN

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:35.368
THE STATE FAITH.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:36.569
THE FIGURE HERE DEMONSTRATES

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.871
THAT CALIFORNIANS SPEND MORE ON

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.175
HOUSING THAN IN ANY OTHER STATE

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:43.476
IN THE NATION.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.445
AND IN PARTICULAR THE LOW INCOME

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.814
HOUSEHOLDS ARE THOSE THAT ARE

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.515
MOST COST BURDENED.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.384
THE HIGH HOUSING COSTS IN THE

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.618
STATE DOES CONTRIBUTE TO THE

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.787
STATE'S POVERTY RATE SO WELL THE

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.490
STATE'S OFFICIAL POVERTY RATE IS

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.392
NEAR THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.660
THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:02.195
RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.162
ACTUALLY THE HIGHEST ON THE

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.931
NATION ON THAT METRIC BECAUSE IT

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.499
ACCOUNTS FOR THE STATE'S HOUSING

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.501
COSTS.

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:10.369
SO UNSURPRISINGLY LOW INCOME

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:11.938
HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE MOST LIKELY

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.606
TO BE COST BIRD AND THIS MEANS

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:16.075
THAT THEY SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.577
THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING.

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:18.611
AND THEREFORE MAY FACE

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.646
CHALLENGES AFFORDING OTHER

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.181
NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD AND

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.683
MEDICAL CARE.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.184
IN PARTICULAR AROUND TWO TWO

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.253
POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.588
HOUSEHOLDS ARE COST BURDEN.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.090
AND OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:33.192
HOUSEHOLDS FACE MORE DIRE COST

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.928
PRESSURES THEY SPEND OVER 50% OF

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.764
THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.932
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.301
ALSO DISCUSSED HOW OLD.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.003
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ARE

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.837
AFFECTING MIDDLE INCOME

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.106
HOUSEHOLDS.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.841
SO ABOUT ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.476
IN THE STATE AT OR ABOVE THE

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.645
MEDIAN INCOME ALSO FACED COST

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.881
BURDENS AGAIN SPENDING MORE THAN

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:57.817
30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.252
IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.087
THE HANDOUT WE DISCUSS HOW THE

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.488
NEED FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.391
ASSISTANCE OUTSTRIPS RESOURCES.

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.527
IN RECENT DECADES FEDERAL STATE

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.162
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.329
HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:11.898
ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABILITY

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.233
CHALLENGES BY SUBSIDIZING THE

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.034
CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:15.935
HOUSING.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.236
AND THEN REDUCING THE COST OF

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.304
HOUSING FOR SOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.705
EXAMPLE THROUGH THE USE OF

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:20.773
HOUSING VOUCHERS.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.343
THERE ABOUT THREE POINT ONE

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.444
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE THAT

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.412
RENT HOUSING.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.914
AND ABOUT TWO POINT THREE

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.415
MILLION THAT ARE VERY LOW INCOME

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.617
CITIES ARE HOUSEHOLDS EARN 50%

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.886
OR LESS OF THE MEDIAN INCOME IN

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.054
THEIR COMMUNITIES.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.355
AND JUST THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:37.290
THAT WERE INVESTED IN THESE

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.257
PROGRAMS AREN'T ENOUGH TO

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.493
SUPPORT THIS ENTIRE POPULATION.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.629
AROUND ONE QUARTER OF THE LOW

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.464
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.732
ARE BENEFITING FROM SUBSIDIZE

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:47.700
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THIS POINT

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.268
THAT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.971
THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE --

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.940
AND SO BECAUSE THE PROGRAM THAT

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.408
AIM TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.442
HISTORICALLY KIND OF JUST FOR

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.944
SUCH A SMALL SHARE.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.278
THESE PROGRAMS ALONE HAVE NOT

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.013
BEEN ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.882
MAGNITUDE OF THE STATE'S --

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:06.619
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.186
SO HAVE YOU PROVIDED SOME

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.056
CONTEXT ON THE STATE'S HOUSING

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.457
CHALLENGES ON PAGE. SIX OF THE

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:14.260
HAND OUT WE TURN TO ADDRESS SEEN

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.661
HOMELESSNESS.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.029
THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.831
CHALLENGES ARE LINKED TO THE

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.467
STATE'S AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.836
RISING HOUSING COSTS.

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:24.937
THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE WEIGHT

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.172
OVER THE RISE OF WAGES

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.306
PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.508
COMMUNITIES PUTS CALIFORNIANS AT

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.677
RISK OF HOUSING INSTABILITY AND

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:32.845
HOMELESSNESS.

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.614
THOSE WHO PAY AT LEAST HALF OF

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.048
THEIR INCOME TOWARDS HOUSING ARE

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.917
AT GREATEST RISK AND SO FOR

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.752
THESE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.254
MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.757
JOB LOSS OR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:45.191
COULD PUSH THEM INTO

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.259
HOMELESSNESS.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.360
CALIFORNIA HAS MORE PEOPLE

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:48.761
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.396
STATE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.264
THE NATION.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.733
AS OF JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.167
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.302
THOUSAND HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.605
LIVE IN THE STATE IS ABOUT 25%

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.173
OF THE TOTAL.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.707
POPULATION OF HOMELESSNESS

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:04.010
AROUND THE COUNTRY'S

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.578
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS JUST

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.046
ABOUT 12% OF THE NATION WE CAN

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.582
WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.384
OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.286
THE LAST TWO BULLETS ON PAGE SIX

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.121
PROVIDE SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.789
THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:17.823
AND HERE I'LL JUST POINT OUT

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.292
THAT THE STATE ALSO HAS THE

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.360
HIGHEST SHARE OF AN SHELTERED

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.296
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.664
AND SHELTERING ALL OF THESE

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.731
INDIVIDUALS WE ESTIMATE WOULD

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.668
COST ABOUT TWO TO THREE BILLION

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:33.906
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.241
SO NOT ONLY PROVIDE A CONTEXT

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.042
FOR BOTH THE HOUSING AND

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:37.610
HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES WOULD

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.946
PROVIDE A SUMMARY ON PAGE SEVEN

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:41.781
OF RECENT MAJOR ACTION IN THE

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:42.248
STATE.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.582
SO BOTH ACTION BY THE

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:46.185
LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO BY VOTERS

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.987
REFLECTS THIS RECOGNITION STATE

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:50.256

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.625
THE LEGISLATURE AT THE TURN-NOTED IN HER OPENING COMMENTS

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:55.728
ADOPTED A PACKAGE OF BILLS IN

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:56.295
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT TACKLE

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:56.996
SOME OF THE AFFORDABILITY

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.331
CHALLENGES IN THE STATE THE

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.432
PACKAGE INCLUDED.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.900

AN APPROVED MORE HOUSING.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.348
LEGISLATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:15.915
ALSO MADE STRIDES IN THESE

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.550
EFFORTS BY REVAMPING LOCAL

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:18.451
PROCESSES THAT REGIONAL

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.952
GOVERNMENTS USED TO ALLOCATE

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.887
STATE HOUSING TARGETS BUT THEN

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.123
ALSO TE METHODOLOGY THE STATE

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.391
USES TO DEVELOP THOSE TARGETS.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.993
AND TO THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.227

INVESTMENTS FOR HOMELESSNESS IN

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.364
PARTICULAR WITH THE FIVE HUNDRED

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.465
MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:33.766

TERM SOLUTIONS ESSENTIALLY FOR

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.073
HOMELESS POPULATIONS.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.609
AND SO ON PAGE EIGHT WE TURN TO

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.478
SORT OF ACTIONS BY THE VOTERS.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:46.445
WHICH AUTHORIZED TO BONDS AS

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.247
PART OF THE NOVEMBER TWENTY

EIGHTEEN ELECTION THE FIRST WITH

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.283
A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BOND THAT

ARE HOMELESS OR AT OR ARE AT

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.703
RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.872
AND SO ON THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.008
HAND OUT --

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.343
WE DISCUSSED SORT OF THE

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.178
ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGE BEFORE

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:22.481
POLICYMAKERS AND THAT ADDRESSING

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:23.883
THIS CHALLENGE WILL LIKELY NEED

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:24.950
YOU WILL NEED TO BE APPROACHED

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.352
BY A NUMBER OF ANGLES AND SO WE

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.686
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:28.788
ARE BEING DISCUSSED TO

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:29.622
UNDERSTAND BY.

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.223
THE LEGISLATURE AND BY

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.258

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.396
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:40.299
CHALLENGES THE STATE FACES.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.467
AND THE LEGISLATURE OR WELL IT

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:43.202
COULD PURSUE A VARIETY OF OF

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.437
APPROACHES WILL HAVE TO SERVE

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:45.971
AWAY THESE TRADES TRADE OFF AS

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.673
IT CONSIDERS ITS NEXT STEPS --

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.810
AND WITH THAT OF THANK YOU AND

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:51.343

QUESTIONS.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.045
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.814
HOLD QUESTIONS ON TO THE END OF

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.981
A AND SO WE CAN HEAR FROM

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.216
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL

00:11:57.283 --> 00:12:00.319
GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.189
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:04.523
FOR TED BE HERE ALL BRIEFLY

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.357
OUTLINE FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:07.126
PROPOSALS ON HOUSING AND THEN

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.661
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:10.496
HOMELESSNESS.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.630
THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPLES --

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.065
THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.266
ADMINISTRATION --

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:15.901
WERE THINKING I'VE AS WE ALL PUT

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.436
TOGETHER HIS PROPOSALS ON

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:18.537
HOUSING.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:19.538
THE FIRST IS THAT HOUSING HAS

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:22.374
HISTORIC STILL FUNDAMENTALLY

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.009
REMAINS A LOCAL FOR SPOTS

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.245
ABILITY ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:27.079
AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS THAT

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:28.614
DRIVE THE PERMITTING PROCESS

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.583
SEES AND THE ZONING PROCESS SEES

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.984
AND GENERALLY TAKE THE LEAD.

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.487
IN DEVELOPING PLANS FOR HOUSING

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:35.988
FOR THEIR RESIDENTS.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.223
THE SECOND PRINCIPLE AS MISS

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:38.724
FOUR HOURS MENTIONED IS THAT

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.459
HOUSING HAS REACHED CRISIS

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.061
LEVELS OF STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.530
LACK OF ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.798
WE HAVE A MEDIAN HOME PRICE

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:46.899
THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.667
NATIONAL AVERAGE WE HAVE GROWTH

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.136
AND RUNS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.837
DECADES THAT FAR OUTSTRIPPED

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.172
GROWTH IN INCOMES.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:54.573
AND WE ARE MILLIONS OF UNITS

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.175
SHORT OF JUST WHAT WE NEED TO

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.810
BUILD JUST TO KEEP UP WITH

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.045
INCREASES IN POPULATION OVER THE

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:01.547
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.581
UNTIL THE THIRD PROMISE FLOWS

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:04.283
FROM THE FIRST TWO WHICH IS THAT

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.285
THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE A ROLE

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:07.887
IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.388
TOGETHER TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.923
BUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.658
TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.293
AND EMPOWER THEM TO STEP UP TO

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.361
THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.229
JUMPSTART LOCAL LEADERSHIP TO

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.197
MEET THESE GOALS.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.298
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.233
THIS NOT JUST IN THIS BUDGET AND

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.368
THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:23.602
INCLUDES A LOT OF ONE TIME

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:26.071
FUNDING FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:26.639
TWENTY TWENTY BUT THIS IS

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:27.806
OBVIOUSLY A LONG TERM

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:29.608
PROPOSITION THIS PROBLEM IS NOT

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.510
CAN BE SOLVED IN ONE YEAR OR TWO

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:31.744
YEARS.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.678
OR EVEN OVER THE LIFE OF THIS

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.246
ADMINISTRATION BUT WE WANT TO

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:36.048
START RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE VERY

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.149
COGNIZANT AS MADAM CHAIR

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.251
MENTIONED THAT THESE PROPOSALS

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.452
BUILD ON PROPOSALS THAT THE

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:44.256
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED OVER THE

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:44.456
LAST.

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:46.125
SEVERAL YEARS.

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:46.759
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:47.860
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON HOUSING

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.295
I THINK THE EASIEST WAY TO THINK

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.796
ABOUT IT IS TO BREAK IT INTO TWO

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.365
BUCKETS A SHORT TERM BUCKET.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.800
AND THEN A LONG TERM BUCKET.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.635
IN THE SHORT TERM THE GOVERNOR'S

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.704
BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT SEVEN

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.039
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.774
SPENDING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.275
CRISIS IN THE CURRENT IN THE

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.843
BUDGET YEAR.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.078
OF THAT ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.813
BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.281
MILLION IS FOR LOCAL AND

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.516
REGIONAL PLANNING AND PRODUCTION

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.985
GRANTS THAT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.320
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:15.721
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH STAFFING

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:18.224
AND PERSONNEL WOULD PROCESSES

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.592
FOR ZONING AND PERMITTING TO

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.193
GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.695
ACTUALLY MEET THE GOALS THAT WE

00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:23.996
ARE SENDING OUT FOR THEM AND

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.097
HOPE TO CONTINUE TO SET OUT FOR

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:25.297
THEM.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.599
IN THE FUTURE.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.334
AND THEN AS THOSE LOCAL AND

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.335
REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS MEET

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:30.569
MILESTONES WILL HAVE AN

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.204
ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:34.573
DOLLARS IN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.774
THESE GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY CAN

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.244
USE FOR ANY GENERAL PURPOSE AND

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.345
I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:40.479
IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:41.780
KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO RAISE

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:43.315
REVENUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.583
SO WE THINK THIS WILL BE A GOOD

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.385
INCENTIVE AGAIN IN THE SHORT

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:49.488
TERM. TO HELP THESE GOVERNMENTS

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.923
MEET THESE GOALS.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.557
THE SECOND BUCKET OF MONEY WE

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.092
HAD IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:54.360
DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:55.995
HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:56.762
AD THIS IS TO EXPAND THEIR

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.531
MIXED INCOME WELL [inaudible]

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:01.000
HISTORICALLY CALIFORNIA'S

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.268
ASSISTANCE ON HOUSING HAS BEEN

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:04.169
DIRECTED TOWARD LOWER INCOME

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.238
POPULATIONS THAT NEEDS TO BE THE

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:08.574
CASE THAT IS THE CASE IT REMAINS

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.174
THE CASE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:09.875
PROPOSAL.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.577
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.612
THAT ACROSS OTHER INCOME LEVELS

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.147
THAT MAY NOT BE GETTING AS MUCH

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.348
SUPPORT AS THEY NEED BUT ARE

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:17.916
ALSO EXPERIENCING CRISIS IN

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:19.551
AFFORDING HOUSING.

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:21.353
THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.588
PROPOSALS TO HELP THEM AS WELL.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:23.922
AND THEN THE LAST FIVE HUNDRED

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.025
MILLION DOLLARS IS TO EXPAND OUR

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.593
HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS AND

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.161
THIS INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.095
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOW

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:31.263
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.998
PROGRAM THAT EXISTS.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.134
WITHIN THAT PROGRAM THERE'S A 9%

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.970
PROGRAM AND A 4% PROGRAM AND THE

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.471
4% PROGRAM WHICH IS LESS

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.939
GENEROUS IS HISTORICALLY BEEN

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:42.441
UNDER SUBSCRIBE TO SO WE WANT TO

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:43.909
MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE MORE

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.511
SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAMS.

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:46.512
SO THAT WE BUILD MORE UNITS

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.247
THROUGH THAT VEHICLE AND THEN IN

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:49.982
ADDITION WE HAVE ANOTHER TWO

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.150
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:53.786
WE'RE PROPOSING TO DEDICATE --

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:55.854
FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE WITHIN

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.556
6280% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.024
TO MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT WE GO

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.693
ACROSS A NUMBER OF INCOME LEVELS.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:01.427
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.895
ACCESS TO HOUSING WHILE

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:05.230
CONTINUING TO PRIORITIZE THE

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.899
LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:07.866
AND THEN THE LAST TWO POINTS SO

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:09.201
MAKE ON THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.370
PROPOSAL FOR THE SHORT TERM IS

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.639
THAT WE ARE UNDERGOING A PROCESS

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.173
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:16.208
IDENTIFYING ALL ACCESS STATE

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:16.875
PROPERTY.

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:17.776
THESE ARE PROPERTIES TO THE

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.678
STATE ALREADY OWNS AND THAT

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.146
COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.748
MECHANISMS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:23.482
HOUSING.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.484
SO THAT GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED AN

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.919
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO MAKE SURE

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:28.520
THAT WE CREATE THAT LIST AND

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.222
ONCE WE DO ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.924
MOST PROMISING CANDIDATES WE

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.625
WILL FIND WAYS TO OVER THE NEXT

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:34.893
COUPLE MONTHS AND YEARS.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.395
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TURNING

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.063
SOME THOSE PARCELS THAT ARE

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.798
PARTICULARLY SUITABLE INTO

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.200
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:44.903
AND THEN THE LAST POINT I'LL

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.906
MAKE ON THE SHORT TERM IS. FOR

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.007
E. I. F. THESE THESE ARE

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:50.576
ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:52.044
FINANCING DISTRICTS THAT THE

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.779
ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES COULD BE

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.581
A POSITIVE VEHICLE TO JUMPSTART

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:56.215
THE KIND OF REGIONAL

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.649
COLLABORATION THAT WE THINK IS

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:58.851
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT.

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.753
AND SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND WE

00:17:00.819 --> 00:17:02.154
ARE PROPOSING PAIRING THAT

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:04.056
PROPOSAL WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TAX

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.624
CONFIRM THE PROPOSAL TO CONFORM

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.959
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:08.327
OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS.

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.195
SO WE THINK THAT WHEN WE JUMP

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:10.963
START THE CREATION OF THE CIF

00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:12.364
THESE BY MAKING THEM EASIER TO

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.199
FORM AND WE COMBINED WITH

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.768
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT PROMOTE

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:16.735
INVESTMENT.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.470
IN THESE TYPES OF AREAS THAT CAN

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.340
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN MOVING

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.574
THE NEEDLE ON THE HOUSING FRONT.

00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.876
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LONG TERM

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.377
NOT JUST IN THIS COMING YEAR BUT

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.312
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.781
RECOGNIZE CONSISTENT WITH

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.382
STATUTES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:31.150
HAS PASSED IN MOST RECENT

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.117
SESSION?

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:33.919
THAT THE RENO GOALS TO REGIONAL

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:35.721
HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT NEEDS

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.156
OF REVAMPING AND THE GOVERNOR

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.524
AND HIS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.491
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:40.492
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.327
ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:43.328
COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:44.730
THE SCHOOLS MAKES SENSE GIVEN

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.231
EACH JURISDICTION AND THEN

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:48.167
EVENTUALLY ONCE WE COLLABORATE

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.234
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:50.502
OF COMING UP WITH THOSE GOALS.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:51.804
BEGIN TO ENFORCE THOSE

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.272
REQUIREMENTS BUT I WANT TO MAKE

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:54.873
CLEAR THAT THIS LONG TERM

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.608
PROCESS IS SEPARATE FROM THE

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.076
SHORT TERM FINDING THAT WE ARE

00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:59.945
GIVEN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.079
HELP THEM COME UP WITH THESE

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:01.580
GOALS.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:02.981
AND ALSO THE LYNC TWO

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.383
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WHICH I

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.684
KNOW HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:06.752
ATTENTION --

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:07.553
FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.087
COMMUNITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:10.923
THAT THOSE GOALS ARE HARD BUT IT

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:11.723
SHE VERBAL --

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.692
THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THAT

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:14.893
LEGISLATION THAT ALL TO YOU

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.929
ENACTED LAST YEAR AND WILL BE

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.230
TAKING PLACE IN THE COMING YEARS

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.566
AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.901
YOU SO THERE WILL BE A LEAD TIME.

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:23.802
THERE WILL BE A LINK TO

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.103
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THE

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.004
GOVERNORHAS MADE THAT VERY

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:27.439
CLEAR BUT ISN'T IT IS NOT

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.173
SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.775
RIGHT NOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:30.576
HAPPENING AT THE END OF A

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:31.677
PROCESS.

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.446
THAT WILL BE VERY DELIBERATE AND

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:37.583
COLLABORATIVE US AS WELL THE

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:38.984
GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS ON

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.152
HOMELESSNESS --

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.220
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.688
BEFORE HE WAS GOVERNOR AND

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:43.989
BEFORE HE WAS LIEUTENANT

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:44.690

AND GETTING WHAT WE CALL POWS

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.417
POSITIVE HOUSING ACTS AS HUNDRED

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.452
MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING WE

STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITE SEQUEL

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.024
REVIEW FOR IN THESE HOMELESS

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:28.961
SHELTERS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.395
AND MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER --

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:31.630
PRIVILEGES WE GET TO SPORTS

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:32.898
STADIUMS AS WE HAD DONE FOR

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.800
PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WE ALSO

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.301
GIVE THAT TO HOMELESS SHELTERS

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.436
AND NAVIGATIONS.

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.905
CENTERS IN ADDITION TO THAT FOR

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:40.706
CALTRANS --

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.140
WITH WHAT'S KNOWN AS AIR SPACE

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:43.475
WHICH IS FOR CALTRANS RIGHT OF

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.243
WAY WHERE THERE MAY BE ROOM TO

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.145
BUILD EMERGENCY SHELTERS WE WANT

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.547
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THAT

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:49.848
BECAUSE THAT IS EXISTING.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.316
GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.784
PROPERTY WHERE THAT SUCH USE IS

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.853
SUITABLE AND FINALLY TO OTHER

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.388
PROPOSALS THAT I'LL MENTION THE

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.223
FIRST IS OUR HOUSING DISABILITY

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.324
ADVOCACY PROGRAM WHICH I KNOW

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.592
THE LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED IN

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:01.860
PREVIOUS YEARS.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:02.661
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:04.429
FUNDING IS ON GOING AND THAT'S

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.398
TO MAKE SURE GOING BACK TO THE

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:07.833
POINT ABOUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.568
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.470
HOMELESSNESS AND OFTEN ELIGIBLE

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:12.838
FOR SSI BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.539
APPLIED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:15.907
THAT THEY CAN APPLY AND THEY

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:16.108
HAVE.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.542
ALL THE RESOUCES TO DO SO AND

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:18.910
THAT WOULD DRAW DOWN FEDERAL

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.479
MONEY YOU KNOW NOT JUST STATE

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.680
MONEY.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:22.748
AND THEN THE LAST POINT I

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.416
MENTIONED ARE THESE HOLD PERSON

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:26.184
CARE PILOTS ARE BUDGET INCLUDES

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.285
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:21:27.352 --> 00:21:29.454
EXPAND THESE PILOTS THAT HELP

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:30.322
PEOPLE WITH THESE WRAPAROUND

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:30.989
SERVICES.

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.691
AND THAT COMES ON TOP OF OVER A

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.526
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:35.627
COUPLE YEARS IN FUNDING AT THE

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.896
FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THESE PILOTS

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.631
BUT WE THINK THAT THIS CAN MAKE.

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.633
A BIG DIFFERENCE SO IN SUMMARY

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.368
WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THESE ARE

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.803
JUST YOUR ONE ONE TIME SPENDING

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.138
PROPOSALS WE KNOW THIS IS

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:47.572
SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.140
IN A YEAR.

00:21:48.206 --> 00:21:49.408
BUT WE WANTED TO LAY DOWN A

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:51.109
MARKER WITH THIS BUDGET AS THE

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.744
GOVERNOR IS OPENING PROPOSAL AND

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.079
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ALL OF

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.347

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.948
CAN COME UP WITH A STRATEGY THAT

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:58.016
MAKES SENSE.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.887
BUT FOR THE SHORT AND LONG TERM

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:05.924

REALLY HELP US IN IDENTIFYING

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:15.333
AREAS IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.803
FOCUSING ON AND PAYING ATTENTION.

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:20.372
IN A VARIETY POLICY AREAS REALLY

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.941

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.748
RECOMMENDATION ON WHERE THE

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:32.918
STATE COULD TAKE ACTION SOME OF

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:34.352
THE LOWER HANGING FRUITS.

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.353
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE'VE

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.855

APPROPRIATE.

00:22:45.797 --> 00:22:46.798
LEVERS IF YOU WILL WE SHOULD BE

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:49.968
PULLING TO TRY TO EXPEDITE.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:50.569
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:52.971
HOUSING.

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.372

REFLECT SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

00:22:58.143 --> 00:22:59.211
OF OUR OFFICE BETTER REALLY

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:01.413
IDENTIFYING THE CONVERSATION

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.049
THEM TAKING PLACE --

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:05.450
AND EVEN THOUGH I THINK SOME OF

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:06.118
THE OPTIONS ARE IDENTIFIED THERE

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.586
THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE THE

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:09.221
BIGGEST THE ACT IN THE SPACE

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:10.822
ARE ALSO THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL.

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.157
UNTIL REQUIRED DIFFICULT

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.658
CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH

WILL VERY MUCH MATTER --

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.531
BUT THINGS LIKE REFORMING LOCAL

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:21.566
ZONING LAWS ALTERING ALLOCATION

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:22.934
OF LOCAL LOCAL TAXES TO

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:25.570
INCENTIVIZE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT --

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:26.671
AND STREAMLINING SEEK A COULD

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:28.106
POTENTIALLY MAKE MAJOR IMPACTS

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:31.910
BUT IT'LL BE ABOUT THINKING

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.912
ABOUT THE PARTICULARS.

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:38.416
UNDERSTANDABLE THIRTY NIELSEN.

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:40.652

HAVE YOU HAD ANY DATA OR

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.691
RESEARCH THAT IS AVAILABLE TO

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:47.626
YOU AS TO WHY WE HAVE NOT BEEN

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:48.426
MORE SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT HAS

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:50.061
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:52.731
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN THIS IS.

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:55.033
EVOLVE OVER DECADES.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.335
HAVE YOU TRIED TO FOCUS ON SOME

00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:57.903
OF THOSE THINGS IN THE

00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:59.671
CONCENTRATION.

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:02.307
OF THE PROBLEM AND WE HAVE FOR

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.341
EXAMPLE.

00:24:03.408 --> 00:24:05.177
A LOT OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.778
A SOME OF THEM HAVE COME IN AN

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:08.580
AXE THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TO

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:09.714
EXEMPT THEM.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.416
FROM MEETING THEIR GOALS.

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:12.784
WHICH I THINK IT'S RATHER

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.020
AMAZING.

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:15.887
THAT THESE MORE WEALTHY

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.355
COMMUNITIES WOULD WANT TO HAVE

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:18.890
AN EXEMPTION WHEN.

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.660
A LITTLE TOWN IKE WHITMAN DISH

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:22.694
CONDEMN.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.062
OR I GUESS IT WAS --

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.864
HUNTINGTON BEACH TO MAYBE THEY

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:28.233
DESERVE THAT BUT SOME

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.201
COMMUNITIES THAT CERTAINLY

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.269
SHOULD HAVE GREATER WEALTH AND

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:31.770
RESOURCES.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:35.240
HAVE NOT STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.409
END ARE NOT EVEN BE IN THE

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:38.376
CHIDED FOR IT.

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:41.046
SOMETHING IS GOING ON TO THE

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.948
YEARS THAT HAS OF GIVEN THE COST

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.649
UP.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.585
BUT NOT GIVEN INCENTIVE FOR THE

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.553
CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING TO

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.321
PROVIDE.

00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:51.656
AN TO RELIEVE.

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:52.991
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE WHAT HAVE

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:55.727
BEEN THE FAILURES THUS FAR NOT

00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:57.395
JUST TO NEW IDEAS AHEAD BUT THE

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:59.030
FAILURES.

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:00.165
SO ALL MAKE A COUPLE POINTS AND

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:01.233
THAT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE MIGHT

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:02.734
HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:03.969
ON SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DATA

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.003
THAT YOU REFERENCED.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.872
BUT THE FIRST IS ONE THING THAT

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.206
WE NOTICED AND LOOKING AT

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.774
PREVIOUS PACKAGES --

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:10.575
AND THE LA --

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:11.943
COMMENTED ON THIS AND THEIR

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.578
REPORT THERE TENDED TO BE A ONE

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:15.347
OFF QUALITY TO THESE THINGS YOU

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:16.615
KNOW LET'S PUT IN THIS MUCH

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.383
MONEY HERE OR A HUNDRED MILLION

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.718
DOLLARS THERE.

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.253
AND OUR BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:24.656
LOT OF ONE WE HOPE TO EMPHASIZE

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:25.991
FOR THIS BUDGET IS.

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.059
THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME PROCESS

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.327
THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME LEVEL OF

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:31.396
THINKING SO WE REALLY WANTED TO

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:32.797
FOLD THIS INTO NOT ONLY A

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.932
REGIONAL STRATEGY BUT THE

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.400
STRATEGY OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.202
BECAUSE YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.570
THAT YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:39.971
DOLLARS HERE A HUNDRED MILLION.

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.573
DOLLARS THERE IS NOT GOING TO

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.774
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO I THINK

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:43.808
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.343
RECOGNIZE THIS TAKES A BROADER

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.544
COMMITMENT AND JUST.

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.913
THROWING MONEY AT IT ESPECIALLY

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:49.047
IN A GIVEN YEAR --

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:51.516
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS THAT.

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:52.951
THIS IS AN ISSUE AND YOU'RE

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.352
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT LOCAL

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.287
GOVERNMENTS ARE DIFFERENT AND

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:57.455
EACH HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES BUT

00:25:57.522 --> 00:25:58.623
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.259
BUILDING OVER TIME AND SO IN THE

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.560
ABSENCE OF STATE ACTION WE

00:26:02.627 --> 00:26:04.663
RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.764
THERE'S OFTEN.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.499
A FORCE FOR THE STATE TO KEEP

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:09.267
THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE AND WHEN

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:10.568
THE POPULATION IS GROWING THE

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:12.804
WAY IT HAS IN CALIFORNIA WITH.

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.172
A LOT OF THAT POPULATION GROWTH

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.974
COMING IN THE COASTS IN

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.575
PARTICULAR WERE CASA CON OUT

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:18.777
THAT'S NOT REALLY TENABLE

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:19.911
SOLUTION RIGHT AND WE THINK OF

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:22.447
CALIFORNIA IN.

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:22.981
NINETEEN SEVENTY HAD ABOUT

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:24.983
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE IN

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.550
NINETEEN NINETY IT HAD ABOUT

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.885
THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE AND NOW

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.119
WE'RE JUST ABOUT AT FORTY

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:30.622
MILLION PEOPLE AND SO.

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.423
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:32.791
THAT YOU HAVE HAPPENS IN A MONTH

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.059
OR A YEAR BUT SLOWLY OVER THOSE

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:36.227
YEARS OVER THE LAST IN NINETEEN

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.696
SEVENTY AT THIRTY FORTY YEARS.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.598
IF YOU'RE NOT KEEPING UP EACH

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:43.234
YEAR AND IF YOU'RE TEN OVER TIME

00:26:43.301 --> 00:26:45.236
THAT'S HOW YOU WIND UP MILLIONS

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:46.805
OF HOUSING UNITS SHORT HAVE

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:47.939
WHERE YOU NEED TO BE.

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:50.108
A AND THEN I THINK THE LAST

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:50.976
POINT THAT ALL NAY CASE.

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:52.210
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PLANNING

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:54.012
PROCESS AND CERTAINLY THE

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.313
LAWSUIT WITH HUNTINGTON BEACH

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.115
GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION OVER THE

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:58.149
LAST MONTH?

00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.417
AND YET THERE WERE REASONS THAT

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.252
SPECIFIC LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.687
IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY OFTHAT

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:03.521
PROCEEDING.

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:04.422
AS WELL AS THE STATUTE OF

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:06.358
LIMITATIONS BUT I THINK THE

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:07.625
GOVERNOR WOULD BE THE FIRST TO

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:09.661
SAY THAT WE DO HAVE TO ENFORCE

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:11.696
OUR HOUSING GOALS AND THE LAW

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.865
BUT YOU KNOW IN MY PRESENTATION

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:15.934
TODAY DID NOT MENTION LAWSUITS

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:16.901
BECAUSE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.536
LAWSUITS ARE NOT THE WAY THAT.

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.637
WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:21.172
TOGETHER TO GET OUT OF THIS MESS.

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.407
THE REASON --

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:24.242
HE TOOK ACTION THERE IN CONCERT

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.677
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:27.345
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE HOUSING

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:29.047
ELEMENT THERE'S PLANNING.

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:30.115
THEN THERE'S ENTITLEMENT AND

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.683
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS IS TO

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.218
ACTUALLY GET UNITS READY AND

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:34.285
THEN THERE'S ACTUALLY PRODUCING

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.754
THE HOUSING AND WE KNOW WE HAVE

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.788
A LOT OF WORK.

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.323
AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT A LITTLE

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.158
BIT WITH RENO TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.193
THAT PROCESS FOR HOW WE ASSIGN

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.862
GOALS AND HOW WE MAKE SURE

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:44.996
JURISDICTIONS MEAT AND IS REALLY

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:46.297
UP TO SNUFF.

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:47.265
BUT I THINK WHICH ARE SECTIONS

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:48.800
THAT AREN'T REALLY EVEN STEPPING

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:49.801
UP TO THE PLATE IN TERMS OF

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:53.238
THEIR PLANNING --

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:53.872
AND MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT OR

00:27:53.938 --> 00:27:57.509
EVEN WORK THAT'S AND CAN LAW AND

00:27:57.575 --> 00:28:01.479
DOUBLE OUR HOUSING PACKAGE IS

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:02.947
MUCH BROADER THAN THAT WILL I

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.249
WOULD SUGGEST THAT COMMUNITIES

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.550
ARE SAYING GIVE ME EIGHT MORE

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.385
YEARS AND DON'T BOTHER ME.

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.854
IS ALSO AVOIDING JUST AS MUCH AS

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:12.023
ANY COMMUNITY THAT HAD JUST

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.224
HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.293
THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING ANYTHING

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.628
AND SAYING GIVEN THIS EXEMPTION

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:19.230
IN THE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.032
TIGHTEN UP ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:22.801
AND HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE THE

00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:24.936
NEED AND HOW RIGHTEOUSLY LOOKING

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:26.971
AT THE NEED FOR LITIGATION

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.506
PREVENTION AND INSURANCE AND

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:30.341
SUCH AS INSURANCE MEANING TO

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:31.276
DIMINISH.

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:34.279
THE VULNERABILITY OF COMMUNITIES

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.815
FACING LWSUITS TICKLE REFORM

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:39.617
BEING PART OF THAT HOW SERIOUS.

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:40.785
IS THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:41.086
[inaudible]

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.520
SICK REFORM.

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:44.255
YES SIR TWO POINTS ON THAT FIRST

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.490
IN TERMS OF HELPING COMMUNITIES

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:47.258
MORE BROADWAY THAT'S PART OF WHY

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:49.260
WE WANTED THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:50.929
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PUT OUT --

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.163
IT'S YOU KNOW CAN GO TOWARD

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.498
ULTIMATELY HOUSING PRODUCTION

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.866
BUT IT'S REALLY FOR TECHNICAL

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.534
ASSISTANCE AND STAFFING FOR

00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:57.569
THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE

00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:59.037
WANT JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:00.505
WITH THE LAW'S SO WE'RE TRYING

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.073
TO MAKE THAT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.641
BOTH IN THIS BUDGET YEAR AND FOR

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:06.044
FUTURE YEARS FOR SEQUEL REFORM

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.212
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:08.646
HAS MENTIONED AND I MENTIONED IN

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.281
THE HOMELESSNESS CONTACTS HE'S

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:12.150
ALSO MENTIONED IN THE HOUSING

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:13.585
CONTACTS BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:14.119
SOMETHING THAT WITH THE

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.487
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE TAKING

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:16.421
A LOOK AT BUT WE KNOW.

WE HAVE MORE TO DO AND BRING

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.058
STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER ON THAT --

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:22.060

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:48.613
TIME DOWN THERE AND THOSE

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.749
ELEMENTS AND SO MONEY SO THERE'S

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:53.084
THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.452
THAT PLANNING AND PRODUCTION AND

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.121
THAT WITHIN THAT INCLUDES. TWO

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:57.655
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.557
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ANOTHER

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:01.226
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:02.827
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS OF THAT GETS

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:04.996
YOU.

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.064
TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ARE YES

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.632
SAID THOSE YES SOME THESE ARE

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.299
ELEMENTS OF OTHER THING RIGHT SO

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.834
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT FIVE

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:11.636
HUNDRED MILLION WAS ENCAPSULATED

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.304
IN THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.806
CORRECT YEAH OKAY.

00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:19.110
SO BUT THE HOUSING TAX CREDIT

00:31:19.177 --> 00:31:20.745
PROGRAMS.

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.080
IS THAT PART OF THE ONE POINT

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.781
SEVEN BILLION NEW SPENDING SO IT

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:26.017
IS BUT ACTUALLY WHEN THAT HITS

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:27.452
THE BUDGET THE WAY THOSE TAX

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:29.420
CREDITS ARE STRUCTURED IS THAT

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:31.155
IT'S ONLY AFTER THE PROJECT IS

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:32.423
COMPLETED --

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:32.991
BECAUSE THE TAX CREDITS ARE

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:35.693
AWARDED FOR CALLING THE TAX

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.662
BENEFITS OF THAT TAKES PLACE

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.565
OVER SEVERAL YEARS FROM --

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:41.933
SO THAT A GO HEAD YES IT'S OKAY

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.401
YEAH GO AHEAD OF SAID THAT LAST

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:43.968
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:44.702
ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS --

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:45.303
REFERRING TO THAT --

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.903
ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE I SHOULD

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.871
HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR THAT

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:49.240
INCLUDES BOTH OUR HOUSING AND

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.541
ARE HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE --

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:51.943
SO THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO ONE

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.578
POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.079
AND THEN THAT LAST FIVE HUNDRED

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.714
MILLION DOLLARS FOR TAX CREDITS --

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:57.815
THAT WILL BE OUT IN THE OUT

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.484
YEARS AND NOT THIS YEAR I SHOULD

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.618
MAKE ONE POINT ABOUT THAT THAT

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:04.589
WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN --

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.090
AND IT IT MAY BE THERE AND I

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:07.558
DIDN'T CATCH IT BUT I DID TRY TO

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:08.960
LOOK IN DETAIL ON THAT.

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.262
IS JUST ONE OF ONE PAGE THAT

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.064
KINDS OF BREAKS THAT DOWN SO

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:13.898
THAT.

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.500
WHEN WE HEAR IT VERBALLY WE

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:16.267
DON'T --

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:19.871
ASSUME THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE FIVE

00:32:19.937 --> 00:32:20.705
HUNDRED MILLION NCENTIVE IS

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:23.341
SEPARATE FROM THE SEVEN HUNDRED

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:25.710
FIFTY SO WE JUST KIND OF SEE

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.477
THAT BREAK DOWN THAT BE ACTUALLY

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:27.211
DELIVERY AND I SHOULD MAKE ONE

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:28.179
LAST POINT TO YOUR POINT THAT

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.747
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:30.982
TAX CREDITS. FOR HER THOUGH IT

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:31.749
DOESN'T HIT THE BUDGET RIGHT

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:34.018
AWAY THAT IS DESIGNED AS AN

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:35.086
ONGOING PROGRAM.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.754
SO MY SECOND QUESTION WAS THAN

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:37.922
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.991
YOU DESCRIBED ON HOMELESSNESS

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:41.759
AND YOU DID BREAK THAT DOWN SO I

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.394
KNOW THAT THE HUNDRED TO TWO

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:44.162
HUNDRED AND THE TWO HUNDRED ARE

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:48.032
ALL PART OF THAT.

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:48.733
FIVE BUT THAT [inaudible]

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.801
FIVE IS.

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:51.436
SUBSUMED IN THIS ONE POINT SEVEN

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:54.072
FIVE BILLION FOR ITS FROM A IT'S

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.207
A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION IS IN THE

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.976
WHAT FOR IN THE ONE POINT SEVEN

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.879
FIVE THAT'S BEING IT IS.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.281
ON THE RIGHT POSE A VERY GREAT

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:05.650
SO THAT IT JUST A BREAK DOWN

00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:07.151
WITH YOU HELD A WILL MAKE SURE I

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:08.486
GET THAT TF IS HEARING IT

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:11.356
VERBALLY I GOT A LITTLE CONFUSED.

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:14.659
OKAY SO THEN --

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:18.763
FOR THE LA JOH --

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.432
FOR ASK THE QUESTION I NOTE THAT.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:22.367
IN YOUR MATERIALS YOU GAVE US

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:23.868
YOU SHOW THAT --

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:24.635
AS BEST AS WE CAN TELL AS OF

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:25.403
JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.003
CALIFORNIA HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.604
AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOMELESS

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:26.838
PEOPLE.

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:27.672
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:29.941
OF DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:31.442
ABLE TO ACCURATELY COUNT.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.111
BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD PORTION

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:34.779
OF HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT REALLY

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.514
DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN.

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:37.949
THEY REALLY THERE'S A STIGMA

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:38.983
AROUND BEING HOMELESS THEY'RE

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.485
NOT THE ONES THAT ARE LIVING IN

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.120
A TENT YOU KNOW THEIR COUCH

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.288
SURFING OR THEY'RE IN CARS BUT

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:46.124
THAT'S OUR BEST ESTIMATE NOW.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.492
BUT THE OTHER THING I NOTICED

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:47.692
THAT.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.895
YOU THREE THOUSAND SO THAT'S A

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:52.263
SMALL PROPORTION OF THAT HUNDRED

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.398
AND THIRTY ARE CHRONICALLY

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.399
HOMELESS.

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:57.468
SO WHAT I THINK WE'VE SEEN IN%

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.003
DATA RECENTLY IS THAT.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.838
WE THERE'S A LARGE PERCENT OF

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:01.739
OUR HOMELESS FOLKS.

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:04.041
WHO?

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:05.943
OUR HAVE IN.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.911
THEIR NEWLY ON HOUSE.

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.646
THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.848
BEEN CHRONICALLY HOMELESS.

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:13.684
THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JOBS

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.653
THEY ARE YOU KNOW FAMILIES THEY

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.255
ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WERE

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.389
HOUSED.

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:20.425
IN WHETHER THAT WAS SIX MONTHS

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.726
AGO OR THREE YEARS AGO.

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.594
RIGHT IN SO WHAT I ONE THING I

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.263
WAS INTERESTED IN IS WHETHER WE

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.432
HAVE ANY DATA.

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:28.065
ON THE GROWTH [inaudible]

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:31.803
OF THESE HOMELESS BECAUSE WE

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.771
HAVE A PERCEPTION I THINK.

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.540
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEE MOST

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.508
VISIBLY THAT HOMELESS ROLE

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:38.776
MENTALLY ILL AND ADDICTED.

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:41.679
WHEN IN FACT WHAT THE WHEN WE

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.348
GET INTO THE DIFFERENT --

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.451
CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT ARE.

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:48.753
DOING A LOT OF MORE ACCURATE

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.521
COUNT SIR SIR YOU KNOW DEALING

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:51.756
WITH THOSE POPULATIONS BETTER

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.057
THEY'RE SHOWING US NO.

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.692
THESE ARE NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.427
THESE ARE NOT.

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.595
MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THESE ARE

00:34:57.662 --> 00:35:00.698
NOT ADDICTED PEOPLE SO DO DO WE

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:01.699
HAVE ANY.

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.168
I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT DATA ON

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.070
THIS GROWTH OF THE HOMELESS.

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:09.407
A YEAR BY YEAR.

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:10.308
YES I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:11.476
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT --

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.010
THERE THERE'S RESEARCH THAT

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:14.512
SUPPORTS THAT BECAUSE OF THAT

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.881
THERE'S A A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.382
JUST THE THE GENERAL

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:19.784
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES AND

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.986
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING MARKETS AND

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:22.854
AN IN --

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.556
KIND OF FRICTIONAL NOT

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:27.291
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS BUT AS MY

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:28.860
COLLEAGUE MENTIONED ARE KIND OF

00:35:28.926 --> 00:35:30.595
ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:32.363
ONE KIND OF NEGATIVE LIFE EVENT

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.331
CAN KIND OF PUSH THEM INTO

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:35.633
HOMELESS DISORGANIZED ILL OR

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.334
EXPENSE AND SO.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.702
AND SO THAT IS DEFINITELY ORE

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.437
PREVALENT IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY

00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:40.972
OTHER STATES --

00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:42.206
THERE IS SOME --

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:44.008
DATA IT YOU KNOW AS WE BROKE OUT

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.476
IN YOUR HAND OUT HERE THAT THAT

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.077
KIND OF SEPARATES --

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.612
CONNICK HOMELESSNESS FROM THE

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:48.813
GENERAL POPULATION IN THAT DID

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.281
IT DOES GO BACK SEVERAL YEARS

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:51.849
AND WE DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND BUT

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.084
WE COULD CERTAINLY CIRCLE BACK

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.284
WITH.

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:56.387
YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE SOME OF

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:57.755
THAT ONE CAVEAT IS THAT.

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:58.890
I CAN BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO

00:35:58.956 --> 00:35:59.524
COMPARE THESE COUNTS YEAR OVER

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.057
YEAR JUST BECAUSE AS YOU

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:01.292
MENTIONED JUST THE DIFFICULTY IN

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.727
DOING THE COUNTS EACH YEAR SO

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:03.561
THERE'S JUST SOME.

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.962
KIND OF JUST SOME NOISE EACH

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:07.231
YEAR IN THE NUMBERS --

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:08.633
AND ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S KIND OF

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:09.634
CHANGING DEFINITIONS AND

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.668
METHODOLOGIES AND THE WAY THAT

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.036
THE COUNCIL BEEN DONE OVER YEARS

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:12.904
BUT WITH TIS CABBIE OUT SOME

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.838
MIND KIND OF LOOKING AT THE

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:15.439
GENERAL TREND OVER A NUMBER OF

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.875
YEARS -- YOU

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:18.976
KNOW YOU THINK YOU CAN YOU CAN

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:21.112
GET A SENSE AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.681
CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU AND SO I

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.716
THINK -- YOU

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:26.918
KNOW I'M NOT ABOUT TO RECOMMEND

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.853
NECESSARILY A NEW EXPENDITURE IN

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.355
THE BUDGET BY THINK.

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:33.190
ADDITIONAL DATA WOULD HELP US

00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:35.159
BECAUSE AS WE CONSIDER WHERE WE

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:37.728
PUT.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:40.231
HOMELESS MONEY FOR EXAMPLE --

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.367
UNDERSTANDING THE POPULATION.

00:36:43.434 --> 00:36:45.503
CAN REALLY ASSIST US FIGURE OUT

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.673
WHERE IT COULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE.

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:50.875
AND SO ANY --

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.010
ANY ASSISTANCE IN THAT FROM LA --

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.612
WOULD BE HELPFUL EITHER HOW WE

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:56.113
CAN GET BETTER DATA OR HOW QUEEN

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.316
VALUE WITH THAT WHICH LEADS ME

00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:00.117
TO MY NEXT QUESTION OR

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:01.419
SUGGESTION.

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:04.589
WHICH FOLLOWING THE BUDGETEERS

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:05.823
ON PAGE.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.593
NINE A LIST OF POSSIBLE

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:10.027
RESPONSES IN YOU'VE NOW

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.495
CLARIFIED THAT THESE ARE ONES

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.531
THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED VERSUS

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:14.465
PRETEND.

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.234
NECESSARILY THE LA YO'S WEIGHING

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:20.504
IN AS TO WHAT THE LA --

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.540
FROM IN FROM A STANDING BACK

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:25.376
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT ADVICE --

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.111
US TO PURSUEAS BEING MOST

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:28.879
EFFECTIVE SO I WOULD I WOULD

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:30.214
WELCOME THE ELLIE OWES

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:32.383
RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME OF THE

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.851
MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS.

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:36.287
THAT WE CAN USE OUR EXPENDITURES

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:38.289
FIRST.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.523
TO RESPOND TO THE CURRENT

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.825
HOMELESS POPULATION IN OTHER

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.059
WORDS SHRINK IT.

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:44.095
THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS.

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:47.531
SECOND TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS.

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.833
HOW DO WE KEEP CURTAIL THIS

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:51.469
GROWTH?

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:53.304
AND THIRD WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:55.006
THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS TO

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:56.907
INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:59.443
AND WE KNOW VERY COMMONLY WE WE

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.611
HERE -- SEE

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:01.812
FOR REFORM OR HEAR THIS OR WE

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.014
HEAR THAT.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.716
AND AGAIN WITHOUT GOOD DATA.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.652
WE COULD DIRECT OUR EFFORTS IN A

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:10.021
WAY THAT YES COULD BRING US SOME

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:12.390
BENEFIT BUT MAYBE NOT.

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.225
A A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT THAT IS

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:15.726
RIGHT OUT THERE WE HAVEN'T WE

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.794
JUST HAVEN'T.

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.062
UNDERSTOOD YET.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.630
SO I THINK THOSE THINGS WOULD BE

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:20.865
REALLY HELPFUL.

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:23.300
AND I KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:26.237
PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS --

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.571
THAT DATA THAT I'VE SEEN AND

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.674
WOULD BE NICE TO POTENTIALLY

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.775
HAVE COMPILED.

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:32.109
IS THAT.

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:34.712
HISTORICALLY STATES HAVE RELIED

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:37.148
ON FEDERAL FUNDS FOR LOW INCOME

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.983
HOUSING ASSISTANCE WHETHER IT

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.652
SECTION EIGHT OR MORE MONIES

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.154
MEAN MONIES FOR BUILDING

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.122
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT HUD IS

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:46.791
BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT SOURCE.

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:47.692
BUT OVER THE LAST THIRTY TO

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:50.728
FORTY YEARS ALLOCATION HAS

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:53.197
SHRUNK SO DRAMATICALLY THAT FOR

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.699
EXAMPLE.

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.333
IN TERMS OF SECTION EIGHT THEIR

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.969
SEARCH WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:01.172
FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE COMPARED

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:03.274
TO THAT WHICH WE HAVE.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.176
IT'S SO DISPROPORTIONATE AND SO

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.211
UNDERSTANDING BETTER.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.947
WHETHER THE STATE EXPANDING ITS

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.982
PART OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE HOW

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.851
SIGNIFICANT COULD THAT BE IN

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.820
TERMS OF HELPING TO PREVENT

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.021
HOMELESSNESS THOSE ARE THE KINDS

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.556
OF THINGS I THINK THAT WOULD BE

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:20.524
VERY HELPFUL TO US.

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:21.726
AS WE WAIT THESE.

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:23.360
THANK YOU.

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.463
THANK YOU BOB FOR THE LIST IS TO

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.540
MADAM CHAIR I SAID A FEW QUICK

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:39.677

SERVICE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.715
ARE WE DOING WITH SB TO REVENUES

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.183
WE PASS THAT LECTURE HAD A

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.018

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.787
ASSOCIATION THEIR SAMBOY WERE

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.355

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:54.825
WHERE'S IT GOING SO HOW WHAT I

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.026
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:57.561
YES SO I'M GONNA TURN THAT OVER

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.163
TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIELLE WHO'S

RIGHT BACK THERE WHO SHOULD BE

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.799
COMING UP BUT THESE REVENUES AS

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:02.500
YOU KNOW IT WAS.

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:03.667
PASSED BUT THEY'RE JUST

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:04.668
BEGINNING TO COMMENT ACTUALLY

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:05.870
RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:08.973
PUZZLE THAT WERE ACTIVELY

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:12.209
WORKING ON GOOD MORNING DANIEL

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:12.877
BRAND WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.378
AND WE ARE JUST CALCULATE JUST

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.780
RECEIVED THAT FULL FIRST YEARS

00:40:15.846 --> 00:40:16.380
WORTH OF REVENUES WERE STILL

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.882
WORKING ON PLANNING TO DO THAT

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.316
AND ACTUALLY --

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.051
I'M GONNA PASS THAT UP TO EACH

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.387
CD YOU WHO IS PLANNED TO SPEAK

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:24.789
AND THEN --

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.357
DURING THE GOVERNOR'S SPEECH

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:27.558
LAST WEEK HE USED THE TERM

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:31.128
NAVIGATION CENTERS.

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:33.731
SO I'M I'M LOOKING AT PAGE

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:34.331
SEVENTEEN OF OUR HANDS OUT AND

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:35.099
ANOTHER.

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.600
SHEET OF THE NUMBERS AT AND I'M

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:40.004
NOT FINDING NAVIGATION CENTERS

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.172
ANYWHERE DIED.

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.339
DUE TO WHAT IS HE REFERRING TO

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:43.874
SO THE NAVIGATION CENTERS AND

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:44.842
DANIELLE CAN ELABORATE BUT

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:46.610
THEY'RE BASICALLY SO THERE ARE

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:47.878
HOMELESS SHELTERS THESE ARE

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.513
EMERGING EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.315
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.917
AND NAVIGATION CENTERS HAVE A

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:55.319
SHELTER COMPONENT BUT ALSO HAVE

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:57.121
SERVICES IN OTHER WAYS TO HELP

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.056
PEOPLE NOT SIMPLY FOR THAT NIGHT

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.724
BUT TRANSITION TO THE LONGER

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.259
TERM SUPPORT THAT THEY MAY NEED

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:03.527
AND THEN EVENTUALLY.

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.029
GET THAT POSITIVE HOUSING EXIT

00:41:05.095 --> 00:41:07.064
WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT SO

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.333
THAT SPECIFIC CONCEPT IS WITHIN

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.270
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:15.472
HOMELESSNESS BUCKET.

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:17.074
KATE THANK YOU.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.843
AND THEN --

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:20.477
YOU ALSO HAVE A AT LEAST AT

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:21.512
LEAST SOME OF THREE YEARS I'M

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.479
LOOKING AT FOR NO PLACE LIKE

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:25.049
HOME -- ON

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.684
THIS SHEET WHICH IS THAT THE

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.018
PACKET SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.186
PROVIDED HERE.

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.187
BUT IT HAS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO

00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.657
MILLION. 417-182-62418 NINETEEN

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:36.093
AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.727
NINETEEN TWENTY AND I'M.

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:37.995
JUST WONDERING.

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:41.465
WHAT THAT IS ABOUT?

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:42.266
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT SO I

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.701
THINK WE CAN GET BACK ON THAT --

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.436
SO AS YOU KNOW WITH NO PLACE

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.004
LIKE HOME IT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.372
BRING A BROADWAY FOR MENTAL

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.607
HEALTH SERVICES THAT MONEY AND

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.141
THEN THE BOND THAT PASSED LAST

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:51.976
NOVEMBER.

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:54.111
ENABLED THE STATE TO USE UP TO

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.046
TWO BILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:58.716
FOR HOUSING SO WE HAVE AS A GOAL

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.351
IN OUR BUDGET TO ACCELERATE THE

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.019
USE THAT MONEY FOR HOUSING AS

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:03.654
SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT TO MY

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.322
KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THAT MONEY HAS.

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.924
HAS GONE OUT THE DOOR JUST YET

00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:09.526
SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN SO WE ARE WE

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:10.594
GOING THROUGH THE GRANT

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:13.564
APPLICATION PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.465
AND YOUR FRIEND IT AGAIN --

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.400
YES WE ARE CURRENTLY AYE WE HAVE

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.002
I BELIEVE THE NO FAT OUT AND WE

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:20.537
RECEIVE SOME APPLICATIONS --

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:21.672
CAM HDD CAN MAYBE SPEAK TO

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:22.873
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SPECIFICS

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.741
ON THAT BUT WE ARE IN THE

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:25.576
PROCESS SUPPORTING THE FIRST

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:26.176
ROUND OF FUNDING.

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:28.479
KAY AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.214
ON SB TWO ZONES --

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.548
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN.

00:42:31.615 --> 00:42:34.285
REALLY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT RENO

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.586
GOALS -- SO

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.322
CONTENT TO LITIGATION I WON'T

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:38.889
TALK ABOUT IT.

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.190
NOTE.

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:41.325
I WAS SENATOR OF BERGEN I SURE

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.293
HUNTINGTON BEACH SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:46.363
TRYING TO WORK ON SOMETHING BUT

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.398
EVEN THE READING GOALS.

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:48.832
BABY COULD USE A LITTLE REFINING

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.234
BECAUSE HUNTINGTON BEACH HAS RE

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.435
NIGGLES OF LIKE THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:52.436
AND FIFTY THREE UNITS IN THERE

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.971
JUST FOR UNDER CHAI.

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:55.572
BUT THE CITY NEXT DOOR FROM

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.374
VALUE ONLY HAS EIGHTY SIX COSTA

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.676
MESA.

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.511
TO NEWPORT BEACH FIVE SO THERE'S

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:04.148
SOMETHING KIND OF COULD BE I I

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:06.784
THINK BUT WHERE MY FRUSTRATION

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.620
HAS BEEN AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR.

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:12.022
IS WE'VE BEEN TOLD EACH CITY HAS

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.457
TO ESTABLISH AN SP TWO ZONE

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:14.825
WHICH IS WHERE YOU COULD PUT.

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:17.027
A YEAR ROUND HOMELESS SHELTER

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:19.163
USING TWO HUNDRED BEDS.

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:21.098
SO THE CITY OF FULLERTON

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.399
ESTABLISHES A LOCATION.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:23.901
I BUY A BUILDING.

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.936
AND THE CITY GOES NUTS.

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.553
I'M JUST WONDERING AS AS THE

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:43.120
GOVERNOR'S GETTING A LITTLE

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.555
FIRMER.

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:45.422
ABOUT RINA.

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.191
HOW DO WE GET A LITTLE FIRMER

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:48.659
FOR THE HOMELESS?

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:50.761
WITH SB TWO ZONES BECAUSE

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.196
EVERYBODY'S.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.698
DOING THE GENERAL PLANTS.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:55.599
IN THEIR IN THEIR A AND THEY'RE

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:56.800
DOING THEM.

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:57.968
BUT IGNORING NEMESIS CENTER

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.770
NIELSEN KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT'S

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.038
LIKE.

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:01.905
SO SO YOU'RE HAPPY BECAUSE YOU

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:03.707
KNOW.

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.342
THE CITY HAS DONE THEIR GENERAL

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.478
PLAN AND EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:08.412
AT LEAST HUNTINGTON BEACH WAS

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.713
HONEST.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.548
AND SAID WE'RE CUTTING BACK.

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:12.182
YOU KNOW TO WORK IN A DIFFERENT

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.784
MODE -- BUT

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:14.952
WE'RE GETTING CITIES THAT SAY

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:17.154
YEAH WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:18.655
THEN DON'T.

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:20.591
AND SO I'M I'M FRUSTRATED THEIR

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.326
IS AS AN ADVOCATE FOR

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:23.560
HOMELESSNESS.

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:25.129
THAT ARE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:25.596
TO END UP [inaudible]

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:29.500
JUST SERVICE.

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:31.869
SB TWOS SO I I JUST I I JUST PUT

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.504
THAT OUT THERE FOR YET BECAUSE

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.972
THIS WILL BE A MORE CRITICAL

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:35.906
ONCE WE START [inaudible]

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:38.342
ALLOCATING THESE --

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:40.511
THE SAYS.

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.546
PROP TWO FUNDS SO.

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.014
ABSOLUTELY IN TWO QUICK POINTS

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.883
ON THAT FIRST IS ON ARENA

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.017
HEADING THE MINISTRATION

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.652
RECOGNIZES JUST LIKE YOU SAID

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:48.952
THAT.

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.587
IN THE PAST THESE GOALS HAVE NOT

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.623
NECESSARILY REFLECTED REALITY

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:53.924
AND SAID THAT SOMETHING THAT

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.760
WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR H. C. D. --

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:57.661
BUILDING ON THE LEGISLATION THAT

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.163
WILL BE PASSED LAST YEAR TO MAKE

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.131
SURE THAT WITHOUT COMMENTING ON

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.266
THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES THAT YOU

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.434
MENTIONED THAT SOME THESE

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.368
DISPARITIES.

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.235
THE DON'T SEEM TO REFLECT THE

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.370
ACTUAL HOUSING NEEDS OF THAT

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.038
JURISDICTION ARE CORRECTED

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.873
OVERTIME SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.408
GOAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.443
AND WHEN IT COMES MORE

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:13.844
SPECIFICALLY TO THE PROBLEM THAT

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.012
YOU MENTION AROUND HOMELESSNESS

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.246
SHELTERS.

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:17.981
THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND THERE'S

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.017
NO EASY ANSWER TO THAT AND TO

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:21.351
SENATOR NIELSEN'S POINT.

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.252
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:24.054
CAN DRAFT YEAR OVER YEAR WHEN

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:24.822
YOU FIND WORKING WE PUT THIS

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.390
WILL WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR IT'S

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:27.458
NOT GETTING APPROVED.

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:29.226
STIRS NO GOOD ANSWER BUT I THINK

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:29.760
ONE THING THAT IS REALLY

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:30.994
IMPORTANT IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.063
PROPOSAL IS NOT ONLY DOES HE TRY

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.798
WITH THIS ONE TIME MONEY TO

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:35.632
REWARD.

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:36.733
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FOR DOING

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.968
THE RIGHT THING HE REALLY

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:39.837
REWARDS REGIONAL COOPERATION

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.105
BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT RIGHT THE

00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:43.307
COUNTY MIGHT WANT ONE THING AND

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.708
THEN THE CITY MIGHT WANT TO VERY

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:45.709
DIFFERENT BANKS AND THAT'S HOW

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:46.844
THINGS GET PUSHED.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.046
INTO THE FUTURE AND SO WITH THIS

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.147
POT OF MONEY AND THIS IS IN THE

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:51.381
BUDGET YEAR WE'LL SEE WHAT

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:52.883
HAPPENS DEPENDING ON OUR FISCAL

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.351
SITUATION IN THE YEARS AFTER

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:58.288
THAT BUT IF THESE LOCAL

00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:00.691
JURISDICTIONS STEP UP WITH THIS.

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:01.558
NOT ONLY WILL THEY GET THE

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:03.026
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.461
NEED BUT THEY'LL ALSO GET SOME

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:05.762
DECENT SENT A PAYMENT SO.

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.397
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.066
THAT YOUR THAT YOU BRING UP BUT

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.868
IT'S AND GENTLE KNOWLEDGE TO

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:11.702
HELP PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING

R. HOUSING PUBLIC HOUSING ALL

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.351
THE ALL THE PROGRAMS A GOT A

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:28.152
LIMITED BY THE FEDERAL

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:31.288
GOVERNMENT OR LAST DECADE OR SO.

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:34.324
IF IT WAS IS A SOUNDING LIST OF

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:35.425
PROGRAMS --

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:38.328
RELATED TO HOUSING HOMELESSNESS.

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:41.031
OF FUNDING --

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:42.466
FOR PEOPLE THAT.

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:45.035
WERE NEEDED RENT SUBSIDIES ALL

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.804
THOSE THINGS WERE ELIMINATED --

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:52.976
AND THE LAST SAY DECADE OR OR

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:54.545
BEYOND OUT SO WE ALL WE ALL KNOW

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:58.115
THAT THE BURDEN HAS SHIFTED. TO

00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.483
THE STATE.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.152
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INNOCENCE

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.221
AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:06.557
KINDA HAVING A TROUBLE WITH

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:08.025
DEVELOPING.

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:10.727
DOUBT REALITY AND HOW WE'RE

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.529
GOING TO HAVE.

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:16.366
TO HAVE A REAL SPECIFIC.

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:18.769
PLAN ON HOUSING.

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:20.170
OKAY THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW SO

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:22.439
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE USED TO BE A

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.640
OF FEDERAL THING.

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:24.808
IS NO LONGER FEDERAL THING THEY

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.210
ONLY WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN IT

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:27.811
ANYMORE.

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:31.181
OF ME THEY'RE VERY CLEAR.

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:31.815
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY --

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.183
IDEAS.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.986
COMING OUT ON THAT SUBJECT SO

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.554
NOW IT'S SURE.

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.823
TO AND IT'S NOW KIND OF MORE OUR

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.024
RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S KIND

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:41.892
OF LOOK WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:45.729
HERE SO FOR ME --

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:48.832
I LOOK AT THIS AS SETTING SOME

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.134
TARGETS HOW MANY YEARS YOU WANT

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.469
TO BUILD YOU'RE WHO YOU WANT

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.370
BUILDING.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:56.106
FOR AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:57.574
TO COST.

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.842
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THAT

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:02.279
SOME PEARLY SIMPLE ARITHMETIC.

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:06.183
MINUS OF THE SUBJECT --

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.318
THE THE CAR SHARING BETWEEN

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.386
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.787
GOVERNMENT HAS TO BE DEFINED WE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.623
HAVE TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.424
PUT IT X. AMOUNT.

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:17.160
THEY HAVE TO PUT UP X. AMOUNT.

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.895
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THAT WE HAD

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.464
TO BE REAL SPECIFIC WITH IF

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.565
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SPECIFIC

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:23.200
TARGETS OF NUMBER UNITS.

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:24.334
WE HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:26.570
TO PUT UP MIX MOUNT THEY'RE

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:27.104
GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OF X.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.504
AMOUNT [inaudible]

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.239
NO.

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:30.340
WE'VE ALREADY PUT A LOT OF

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.075
EMPHASIS.

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:35.178
IN -- TO OF

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.446
STARTING UP.

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.882
I WOULD SAY A HOUSING PROGRAM.

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:41.785
BUT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED YET.

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:45.122
ON ON GOING SOURCE OF REVENUE

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.590
FOR A MAJOR HOUSING PROGRAM FROM

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:49.159
FROM THE STATE WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:50.594
ONE TIME PROGRAMS HERE.

00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:51.862
THIS IS ONE TIME MONEY IS NT

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:53.430
ONGOING MONEY IT'S LIKE THIS

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:55.132
YEAR MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.800
BUDGET FROM IT'LL GO IT WILL

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:57.467
IT'LL GO AWAY WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.635
MONEY.

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.337
SO I THINK WE ARE TODAY --

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.139
FIVE MORE OF AN ONGOING.

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:04.508
SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WE HAVE TO

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.576
GO BACK IN AND ABLE LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE AN ONGOING

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.347
SOURCE OF FUNDS.

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.848
THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE MY

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.583
COMMENTS IN GENERAL.

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:21.992
EXCELLENT REPORT WRITTEN BY THE

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:24.861

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:34.705
MY WAY OF THINKING IS THIS --

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:36.707
HOW MUCH SUBSIDY?

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:39.476
DO WE DO WE HAVE TO HAVE TO GET

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.545
THE VERY LOW.

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:43.146
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.560
TRICKLE DOWN OF MASSIVE

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.328
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THAT WOULD

00:49:58.395 --> 00:49:58.962
THAT.

00:49:59.029 --> 00:49:59.563
CREATES --

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.198
MORE HOUSING THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

NEED SOME CARS SUBS.

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:05.769
SO WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHO THOSE

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.270
PEOPLE ARE I'VE IDENTIFIED THEM

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:09.639

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:11.908
AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME --

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.410
HOUSING A CHALLENGE PEOPLE HAT

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.445
PAY OVER 50% OF THEIR INCOME FOR

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.881
HOUSING THAT'S ONE POINT SEVEN

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.883
MILLION HOUSEHOLDS.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.518
SO THOSE WHO THE PEOPLE IF YOU

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.353
WANT TO TAKE THAT AND YOU WANT

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.688
TO SAY HOW LONG YOU SHOULD WE

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:27.424
WORK TO PROVIDE THEM HOUSING WE

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:30.360
DID A TEN YEAR PLAN --

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.596
ONLY WE HAVE TO DO ABOUT A

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.196
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND UNITS

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.132
HERE.

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:36.767
BOOK THAT'S A LOT.

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.668
SO -- HOW TO

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.303
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO IT HOW

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.338
TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S DO IT

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:44.574

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING OUT TO

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.350
PUT UP THREE THREE MAYBE FOUR

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:54.084
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.320
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

00:50:57.387 --> 00:51:00.123
OKAY SO WE HAVE TO HAVE LAWS

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.658
THAT ENABLE THEM TO DO THAT I

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:07.798
THINK THE ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:09.299
FINANCING DISTRICT --

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:12.035
LAW IS A GOOD START.

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:16.873
OF OF SAN WHICH DEDICATES 50% OF

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.108
THE FUNDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.243
THAT'S ANOTHER START ALLOWING

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.313
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.382
TO START RESTART SOME KIND OF

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.416
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT KIND OF

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:29.553
PROGRAM --

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.721
THAT'S ANOTHER START OF BUT THE

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.457
STATE GOVERNMENT'S GOING OUT.

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:36.293
TO HAVE A STREAMLINED HOUSING

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.727
PROGRAM I THINK ONE WAY WE CAN

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:41.364
HELP HOUSING IS TO REDUCE FEES.

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:42.699
OF SIR WHAT KOWSKI.

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.872
IN FREMONT WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:51.541
VISA THEY'VE CHART IT WAS TWENTY

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:52.876
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.811
FOR A FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT --

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:58.448
ALTERNATE DWELLING UNIT PROJECT

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:58.982
FOR TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:51:59.049 --> 00:51:59.583
DOLLARS A DAY OF CHANGE THAT

00:51:59.649 --> 00:52:02.118
THERE'S AN ANNOYING SENATOR

00:52:02.185 --> 00:52:02.552
REPRESENTS.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:03.453
THE DATA BACK.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.521
THEY THEY HAVE ACTUALLY KICK UP

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:05.989
AND DECIDED TO DO THE RIGHT

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:07.891
THING AND NOT CHARGE NUMBER

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.793
EIGHTY YOU SO SO SO MY POINT IS

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.331
THE FEE THE FEE ISSUE HAS TO BE

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.432
ADDRESSED.

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.233
WE HAVE TO HAVE A POLICY.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.168
THAT.

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:20.437
KEEPS LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM SHE

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:21.571
OVER CHARGING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.840
PROJECTS.

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:24.741

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.143
KIND OF PROJECTS WE NEED A

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.378
POLICY A LAW.

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.580
THAT PROTECTS.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:31.781
THE THOSE ISSUE CENTER SKINNER

HAD A HAD A PROPOSAL ON RENTS I

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.653
THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HELP --

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.989
PREVENT --

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:40.924
THE A GENTRIFICATION I'D LIKE

00:52:40.991 --> 00:52:41.958
I'D LIKE TO ASK DAILY --

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:45.295
FINALLY IF THEY COULD FIND OUT.

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:47.264
OUR HOUSING STOCK.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.132
OF WE'RE LOOKING AT LIKE IT'S

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:50.901
STATIC HERE.

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.802
BUT WE'RE REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:55.005
HOW MANY UNITS HAVE GONE FROM

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.274
AFFORDABLE.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.542
THE OF THE EXISTING HOUSING

00:52:58.608 --> 00:52:59.376
STOCK HOW MANY YEARS HAVE GONE

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:00.810
FROM AFFORDABLE TO NON

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:01.945
AFFORDABLE.

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.580
DUE TO THE GENTRIFICATION OTHER

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.582
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:06.883
OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.554
BECAUSE THAT'S A NEGATIVE.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.455
TO WHEN THE PRICES GO SO HIGH

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.257
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD AND

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:15.625
THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:16.192
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LIVE THEIR

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:17.661
LIVES IN.

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:18.862
BECAUSE THE RENTS ARE GONNA HI

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.363
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE AEAS LIKE

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.898
THAT NEVER DISTRICT I DO.

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.500
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:27.203
THE THE THE TREND IN CALIFORNIA --

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.371

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.512
MAYBE DUE TO SOME GOVERNMENT

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.680
POLICIES WE HAVE TO FIND OUT

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.881
WHAT GOVERNMENT POLICIES

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.216
ENCOURAGE GENTRIFICATION.

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:42.185

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:36.025
DIRECTLY THERE IS OFTEN AN

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:37.627
OVERLAP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.895
APPLYING FOR SSI WERE ELIGIBLE

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:40.363
BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.664
SSI THERE IS AN OVERLAP THERE

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:42.432
OFTEN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:43.366
EXPERIENCING MENTAL.

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:44.901
HEALTH CONDITIONS SO THOSE ARE

00:56:44.968 --> 00:56:45.835
THE TWO IN OUR BUDGET BETTER

00:56:45.902 --> 00:56:47.670
SPECIFICALLY TIED TO HOUSING AND

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:48.505
HOMELESSNESS AND THEN OF COURSE

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:49.339
THERE ARE OTHER PORTIONS OF OUR

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:49.873
BUDGET.

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:50.473
THAT DEAL WITH MENTAL HEALTH

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.775
MORE BROADWAY AND THAT INCLUDES

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.443
OUR NEW MONEY FOR EARLY

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.378
INTERVENTION FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:56.946
DETECTION.

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.581
AND ALSO INCLUDES --

00:56:58.648 --> 00:56:59.616
THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING TO

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:01.417
OUR AYE HSS PROGRAM INCLUDING RE

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.119
BENCHING THE COUNTY MOE ACTUALLY

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.754
FREES UP MONEY FOR BEHAVIORAL

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.556
HEALTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:07.157
THAT SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:08.391
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:13.863
SINCE IT'S ALL RIGHT FOOD

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.900
RELATED I MEAN MY LISTEN GIVING

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:20.236

PAN AND HIS GROUP --

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.075
AND SO ALL RELY ON THEM WOULD BE

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.777
NICE TO HAVE SORT OF A A TOTAL

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.679
LOOK AT WHAT OUR TOTAL MENTAL

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:31.614
HEALTH FUNDING PIECES AND HOW IT

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.416
ALL SORT OF RELATES BUT AGAIN

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.050
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.118
SUBCOMMITTEE.

THANK YOU CENTER DORADO.

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:43.326
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR --

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.028
THE SHORT QUESTION --

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:47.030
BUT IT'S RELATED TO WHAT SENATOR

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:48.798
NIELSEN HAD RAISED.

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:49.966
ON SOMEONE OTHERS HAD.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.168
OF SAID ABOUT ONGOING SOURCES OF

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.703
FUNDING --

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.171
THESE TO BE THE COMMUNITY

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.873
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IN THE

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.042
STATE WHICH WERE ELIMINATED.

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:01.711
AND I KNOW THAT THERE WERE.

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.112
SOME THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:04.581
SOME THAT WORKED.

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.315
REALLY WELL IN SOME THAT KIND OF

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:10.253
WORK BUT IN LOS ANGELES IT AT

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.288
LEAST KIND OF WORK BECAUSE THAT

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:13.690
WAS A STEADY.

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:17.293
IT WAS A SOURCE OF CONTINUE WITH --

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.963
HOUSING.

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:21.631
THAT WAS --

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.032
THAT'S HOW IT WAS DONE RIGHT WE

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:24.167
WE ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS AN

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:26.436
AGENCY THAT WAS CONTINUOUSLY

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:28.504
MOVING AND AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.405
HOUSING WAS BUILT.

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.174
WITH THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR WAS

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:34.444
AND IS ANOTHER QUESTION SO.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.247
I GUESS BUT TO TO WHAT THE

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:39.983
EARLIER QUESTION WAS DO WE KNOW.

00:58:40.049 --> 00:58:42.118
HOW MUCH AND HOW WELL THOSE

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.253
SERIES?

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:45.655
WORKED TO BE A CONTINUOUS SOURCE

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:48.524
OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING --

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:51.494
BECAUSE WE THREW THE BABY OUT

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.363
WITH THE BATH WATER HERE AND

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:55.064
JUST IT WAS ALL ELIMINATED

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:57.967
WITHOUT HAVING ANY ANALYSIS.

00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:00.536
OF WHERE IT WAS DOING GOOD AND

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.438
WHY IT WAS DOING GOOD BUT IT

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:04.974
CERTAINLY WAS A LOCAL SOURCE OF

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:06.009
FUNDING.

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:08.177
REGULAR SOURCE OF FUNDING SO DO

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:11.814
YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT.

00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.516
THE ALL MAKE ONE OR TWO KEY

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:14.651
POINTS AND THEN DANIELLE OR LA I

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:15.652
MIGHT WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL I

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.519
THINK THE FIRST IS.

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:17.820
AS YOU MENTIONED YOU NOT ONLY

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:19.188
WAS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUT IT

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.523
WAS ELIMINATED A VERY DIFFERENT

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.958
TIME FOR THE STATE EVEN THOUGH

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.860
WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.828
AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT YOU

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:29.098
KNOW WE IT WORKS --

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.466
THE REASON THE GOVERNOR FOCUSED

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.201
ON THE I. S. D.'S IS HE VIEWED

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.670
THIS AS A WAY.

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:35.138
TO CONTINUE TO HARMONIZE YOU GET

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.406
YOUR SECTIONS WORKING TOGETHER

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.541
WHICH WAS A KEY GOAL OF THAT

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.909
PROGRAM THAT WAS ELIMINATED.

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:41.177
BUT AT THE SAME TIME RAIN AND

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.979
SOME OF THE EXCESSES OR THE FACT

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.047
THAT THIS WOULD BE MONEY THAT

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:45.848
WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO SCHOOLS

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:46.716
AND HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:47.684
THAT THOSE.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.852
PROBLEMS WERE CORRECTED FOR BUT

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.754
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WHEN IT COMES

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.122
TO AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING

00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:55.124
WE HAVE SP TWO WHICH IS A COUPLE

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.225
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:57.627
WE HAVE THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.062
HOUSING BONDS WHERE HE BOND

00:59:59.128 --> 01:00:00.029
MONEY WILL HOPEFULLY START

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.564
FLOWING THIS YEAR THAT WE HAVE

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.466
NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING --

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.368
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A BROADER

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.769
ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE --

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.137
THAT'S REALLY A BUDGETARY

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.739
CHALLENGE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:10.340
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.107
ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOOK

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:12.809
FAVORABLY ON IT'S JUST A MATTER

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.111
OF WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.879
FROM AND WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.247
REYES AND REDEVELOPMENT NO THAT

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:18.848
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.317
ELIMINATED IN A BUDGET CRISIS

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:22.685
AND AS MENTIONED IT REALLY.

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.354
IN SOME WAYS TOOK MONEY FROM THE

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.488
SCHOOL SHARE THAT WAS DONE BACK

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.756
FILLED BY THE STATE AND THAT WAS

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:27.757
MONEY THAT THE STATE.

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:29.492
COULD AND THEN SPEND ON OTHER

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:30.493
PRIORITIES --

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.327
SO CERTAINLY THAT'S A

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.262
CONVERSATION WE WANT TO HAVE

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.597
WITH YOU YOU KNOW WE I THINK WE

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.832
SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME GOALS

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.533
IT'S JUST A MATTER ESPECIALLY AS

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.601
A FINANCE.

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.569
THINKING WHERE IS THAT ONGOING

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.937
MONEY COMING FROM.

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:45.308
AND JUST A COMMENT --

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:48.811
I KNOW YOU MADE TO REFORM SUCH

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:53.616
AS OR SPORTSVENUES --

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.752
I WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.553
VERY FIRST --

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.554
PULLS ALL THAT INVOLVED A SPORTS

01:00:58.621 --> 01:00:59.622
VENUE.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.524
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.760
WHAT WE DID WAS TO NEGOTIATE A

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:06.162
VERY BROAD VERY INCLUSIVE

01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.997
GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BENEFITS

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.065
AGREEMENT.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.401
SO WHILE IT'S REFERRED TO AS

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:13.836
DOING A FAVOR FOR BILLIONAIRES

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.038
THAT -- ONE

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.973
WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MODEL

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.509
FOR SUBSEQUENT --

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.743
YOU KNOW SEQUEL --

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.646
SORT OF REFORM TYPE OF PROJECTS

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:26.082
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MODELED ALL

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.383
THE WAY THROUGH.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:27.984
AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH MEANT

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.485
THAT THERE WERE MANY ISSUES IN

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.754
THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE GIVEN IN

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.256
EXCHANGE FOR THE VALUE.

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:35.658
OF HAVING --

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:38.761
A CHANGED ONE PIECE OF THE SUPER

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.496
PROCESS THAT DIDN'T ELIMINATED

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:42.498
ALTOGETHER BUT I JUST THINK IT'S

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:44.400
IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T JUST

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.968
SORT OF THROW EVERYTHING INTO

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.136
ONE CATEGORY.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.604
BUT JUST LOOK AT WHAT THE VALUE

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.540
WAS AND THE EFFORT THAT WAS PUT

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.908
INTO -- SEEK

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.576
WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.977
ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.546
AND THERE ARE WAYS OF DOING THAT

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.514
THAT DOESN'T HARM ANY COMMUNITY

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.184
WE HAD A VERY BROAD INCLUDING

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.019
BUYER MENTALIST COMMUNITY BASED

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:05.455
GROUPS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.490
WHO ALL AGREED.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:08.291
AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT SO I

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:11.494
JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.629
OTHERWISE IT BECOMES ARE YOU PRO

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:14.597
OR AGAINST SEE PLUS.

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.132
AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:16.766
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.936
YOUR Q. --

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.137
SENATE DRUGS OF CENTER WHAT

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.206
CASCADE.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.707
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE TALKS

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.942

ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO SEND

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.077
PROBLEMS.

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.745
DOESN'T JUST GO BACK TO THE

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.381
FISCAL STATION OF OF LAND USE

DO THIS AND WE DON'T GIVE THEM

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.287
THE ECONOMIC MEANS THE REASON

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:41.157
THEY HAVE AUTO MALL SAYS BECAUSE

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:44.627

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.077
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SPECIAL

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.178
TAXES.

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.846
ON PROP THIRTEEN WHICH SEEMS TO

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.481
BE WHAT EVERYBODY'S DANCING

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.550
AROUND HIS HOMELESSNESS AND

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.585
HOUSING WHY IS IT A BAD IDEA NOT

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.888
TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.190
THIS ADMINISTRATION.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.359
THE REPEAL OF PROP.

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:16.893
THIRTEEN SO THAT WOULD BE

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.394
DISCUSSION.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:19.662
SO I THINK --

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.097
I WILL SAY IT IS JUST WHAT THE

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.665
GOVERNOR HAS SAID WHICH IS THAT

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.500
HE IS OPEN TO A DISCUSSION.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.269
ON TAX REFORM AND WE ALL KNOW

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.503
THERE IS AN INITIATIVE THAT HAS

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.138
ALREADY QUALIFIED FOR THE BALLOT

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.107
IN -- TWENTY

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.041
TWENTY AND CERTAINLY THAT

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.177
CONVERSATION BOTH THISYEAR AND

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.044
NEXT YEAR.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.212
ESPECIALLY GIVEN CHANGES TO THE

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.413
PROPOSITION PROCESS NOW

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.848
INVOLVING THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.483
WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS --

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.517
THAT CERTAINLY DISCUSSION THAT'S

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.686
COMING AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:44.086
AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.455
ADMINISTRATION ARE OPEN TO

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:49.525
HEARING ALL PERSPECTIVES ON THAT.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.826
WOULDN'T WITH ALEJO DON'T WE

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:51.561
JUST RETURNED TO LOCAL

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:52.962
GOVERNMENT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.031
DECISIONS WE ACTUALLY DON'T

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.299
RAISE THE ASSESSED VALUE OR

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.634
CREATE SPECIAL TAXES WE JUST GET

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.403
THE AUTHORITY BACK TO THEM.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.137
WELL SO THERE SHOULD ONLY

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.538
CONCERN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:03.806
ACCOMMODATING YOU HOUSING AND

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.041
THEREFORE YOU PEOPLE WILL NOT

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:06.842
RAISE ENOUGH REVENUE TO COVER

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.511
THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:09.979
THOSE RESIDENTS WOULD NEED.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.948
AND SO ALL THREE OF THE

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.417
ALLOCATION OF LOCAL TAXES --

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:17.153
COULD HELP SO THAT YOU GET A THE

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.588
NEW SERVICES NEEDED ASK NEW

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:19.322
HOUSING COMES AND THERE'S A

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.856
NUMBER OF WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.391
DONE -- ONE

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.794
OPTION IS TO ALLOCATE FUTURE TAX

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.162
REVENUE GROWTH IN A WAY THAT'S

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:28.464
REFLECTIVE OF OF POPULATION

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.800
GROWTH AND AND HOUSING BUILDING --

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:31.934
WHILE THESE CHANGES ARE

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.236
CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE AND AND

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.136
MERIT CONSIDERATION THERE'S

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.538
ABSOLUTELY HURDLES TO THAT AS

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:36.906
WELL THERE'S SOME CONSTITUTIONAL

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.374
LIMITS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:40.076
ADDRESSED ON HOW THESE

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.377
ALLOCATIONS HAPPEN --

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.312
THERE'S ALSO CLEARLY IT WOULD BE

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.214
SOME LOCAL PUSH BACK BECAUSE ANY

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:46.849
REALLOCATION WOOD RIDGE

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.384
NATURALLY RESULT IN NEW WINNERS

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.785
AND LOSERS AND THERE CAN BE SOME

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:50.886
CONCERN THAT.

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:52.421
SOME COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT FARE

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:53.756
WELL IN THAT PROCESS OF THERE'S

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.091
DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS BUT IT

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.359
COULD CERTAINLY LEAD TO

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.127
MEANINGFUL CHANGES IN THE SPACE.

01:04:58.194 --> 01:04:59.295
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.162
HAVE IS --

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.298
THAT THE IMPACT FEES FOR NEW

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.567
HOMES AT LEAST IN IN MY

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:04.900
COMMUNITY --

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.270
NOW HAVE BROKEN THE TWO HUNDRED

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:08.771
THOUSAND AREA AND WE CAN SIT

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.373
HERE AND DANCE AROUND IN STATE

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:12.608
AND SAY THINGS MY QUESTION.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:14.677
IS ON THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.978
THAT WE'RE GIVING TO LOCAL

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.948
GOVERNMENTS I HAVE A AN INTEREST

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:22.285
IN EIGHTY USE WE PASSED ALONG

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:22.885
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT SAID

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:23.686
IF YOU DON'T COMPLY WITH STATE

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.355
LAW YOUR YOUR YOUR LOCAL

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.590
ORDINANCES ARE FALLING NóI.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.158
NOT TWO HUNDRED CITIES OF

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.027
ACTUALLY PASSED NEW EIGHTY USE

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.862
LAWS BUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:33.562
NOT NOW SOME OF THEM ARE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.231
COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW AND I

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:37.099
APPLAUD THEM BUT A WHOLE BUNCH

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:37.800
OF THEM.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:41.937
NOT TO POINT OUT ANYONE'S

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.774
REPRESENTED ON THIS PAGE HE USES

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.377
TO JUST TO MOST TO BE DOING WHAT

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.279
THEY SHOULD BE DOING TO TO HELP

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.181
US MEET OUR HOUSING TARGETS.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.749
ARE THEY GONNA BE LIMITATIONS ON

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.584
THEM TO JUST COMPLY WITH STATE

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:56.152
LAW.

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.920
SO WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATION IS

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.188
STILL PUTTING TOGETHER AND BE

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.489
TRAILER BILL FOR CONSIDERATION

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.391
TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE ARE

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.393
TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE PRODUCTION

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.429
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.730
THE ABSENCE OF THIS MONEY.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.499
THAT IS THE GOAL.

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:14.603
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DETAILS.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.372

WITHIN A NEW OPPORTUNITIES ON

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:09.692

TO PAY ANY GAME ON THEIR TAXES.

01:07:13.896 --> 01:07:14.497

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:16.866
A HUGE CONCERN AND GIVE WAY. TO

LARGE CORPORATIONS --

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:24.173
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT IS GREEN

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.708

AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:30.980
VERY BROAD.

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:31.947
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.116
ARE HYPER FOCUSED ON THE DETAILS

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:35.317
IF FOR MOVING TOWARDS

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.119
OPPORTUNITIESOWNS.

AND TAX CONFORMITY ON WHAT THAT

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:40.890
WILL MEAN FOR THE STATE OUR

COFFERS --

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.460
AS WELL AS WHAT OUTCOMES THAT WE

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.429
WANT TO ACHIEVE ME TO BE VERY

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:47.897
SPECIFIC --

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.199
AND NOT BROAD BECAUSE AS WE'VE

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.134
SEEN MULTIPLE PRESS REPORTS ON

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.369
EVEN MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.703
PRESIDENTIAL MINISTRATIONS

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.206
FAMILY HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE.

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.240
ARE CONSIDERED --

01:07:58.307 --> 01:07:59.842
OPPORTUNITY --

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.410
AND GAIN FROM OPPORTUNITIES OWNS

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.812
AN INCREASE IN ON THE FEDERAL

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.513
SIDE EDISON KNOW IF THERE'S BEEN

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.081
EXPLORATIONS ON THIS BECAUSE I

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.416
HAVE SOME CONCERN ON THAT.

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:09.185
ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK ON MAKE

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:10.052
TWO POINTS IN AND THIS IS AN

01:08:10.119 --> 01:08:11.487
ONGOING CONVERSATION THE FIRST

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:12.455
IS THAT --

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.989
ON THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL WE'RE

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.591
STILL FINALIZING THE DETAILS

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:16.592
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.393
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.894
COMPLICATED IT'S NEW THERE ARE A

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.329
LOT OF MOVING PARTS.

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:21.664
AND WE IN PARTICULAR WANT TO

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:22.998
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:23.799
PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.668
VALUABLE AND TO THE EXTENT

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:26.969
POSSIBLE BITS INCENTIVIZING

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.138
INVESTMENT WITHIN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:32.475
SITTING ONE THING THAT'S

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.844
DIFFERENT OUR INTERPRET THEY

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.245
DON'T NECESSARILY RECEIVE ANY

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:38.514
TAX BREAK IT'S THE INVESTORS IN

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.316
THOSE PROJECTS SO I THINK THE

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:41.684
INITIAL GOAL OF THE FEDERAL

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.752
PROGRAMS IS TO GET MORE MONEY

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:44.954
INTO THESE.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.055
DISTRICTS WHERE THE MONEY

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.456
OTHERWISE WOULD NOT GO AND THEN

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:49.158
GIVE THOSE INVESTORS SOME TYPE

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.827
OF BREAK ON ANY CAPITAL GAINS

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:52.995
THAT A CREW --

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:54.730
I WILL SAY I THINK ARE GOVERNED

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:55.564
FIVE STAFF HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.099
INTERPRETATION ON THAT --

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:59.568
AS THEY ARE NOT PAINTING FEDERAL

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:01.370
TAX IN THE NEW GAINES ON THAT

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.973
BASE WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.241
OWNERS CREATED SO WOULD LOVE TO

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:05.841
FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:06.475
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S THAT'S

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.177
CORRECT FOR THE INVESTOR THAT IS

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:09.111
CORRECT GAINED.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:12.281
IN THAT IS A POTENTIAL HUGE HIT

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:14.183
TO WHAT WOULD BE OUR STATE

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.017
BUDGET IF WE'RE GONNA BE

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:16.852
CONFORMING YES YES AND SO

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:18.487
CERTAINLY AND ESPECIALLY WHAT WE

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.588
DO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:22.091
WERE VERY WARY OF ANY --

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.492
ANY POLICIES THAT MIGHT AFFECT

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:24.727
THE GENERAL FUND IN A NEGATIVE

01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:26.161
WAY SO AS PART OF OUR TAX

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.830
CONFIRM THE PACKAGE WE'RE DOING

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.532
OUR MODELING AND TAKING A HARD

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:30.966
LOOK AT WHETHER.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.368
WHAT THE REVENUE IMPACT WILL BE

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:33.302
AND WHETHER THOSE PROJECTS WILL

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:35.638
BE BENEFICIAL AND I THINK THE

01:09:35.704 --> 01:09:38.107
SECOND THING TO YOUR POINT IS

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.942
THIS QUESTION OF MORE YOU KNOW

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:40.976
HOW WILL HOW WILL THIS BE

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:42.778
DETERMINES OPPORTUNITY ZONES OF

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.046
ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED UNITS

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:44.580
AT?

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.081
FEDERAL STATE DETERMINATION --

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:48.684
BUT THE THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:49.585
BEEN GETTING IS THE I'D LIKE YOU

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.953
SAID IT CAN BE HARD THIS IS A

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.421
PRETTY BROAD CATEGORY SO WE'RE

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.756
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:54.857
WHAT TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.892
ELIGIBLE BUT BY ANY DEFINITION.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.627
IT'S GOING TO BE BROAD SO THE

01:09:58.694 --> 01:09:59.662
REASON IT'S PART OF OUR

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:02.131
CONFORMITY PACKAGES WE TO THINK.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.098
THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.433
LOOK OUT FOR BUT THERE IS A

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.267
POSITIVE ELEMENT TO THEM

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:06.802
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PAIR THEM

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.870
WITH THE IRAQIS.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:13.509
THIS COULD ACTUALLY THE GOVERNOR

01:10:13.576 --> 01:10:15.811
SAID TRANSPORTATION IS HOUSING

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:19.315
THE FACT THIS IS NEW AND THERE

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:19.915
IS A LOT THAT WE NEED TO WATCH

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.952
OUT.

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.286
FOR AGAIN I THINK THAT --

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:26.221
THE NARROWER NARROW THE FOCUS

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.190
THE BETTER --

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.492
AND IF OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.695
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:34.830
TO BE ADDED TO FIND AT ON AND

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.265
WHERE ARE.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.667
DEFICIT IS AT BETWEEN TWENTY

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:39.768
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.270
IS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.539
AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE VERY LOW

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:46.275
LOW AND MODERATE CATEGORIES.

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:47.776
SO IF THAT IS GOING TO BE A

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.345
FOCUS BECAUSE WHAT WE CONTINUE

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.447
TO HEAR AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.681
ANYONE THINKS I'M WRONG.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.316
IS THAT MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:57.219
ARE UNABLE. TO BUILD UNITS

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:58.787
WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES

01:10:58.854 --> 01:10:59.688
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.690
CONSTRUCTION.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.692
SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:04.460
THIS IS A ROAD THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:05.494
GO DOWN.

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.763
IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.932
AND NOT A GIVEAWAY.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.201
AND NOT CAN IMPACT OUR STATE

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:14.637
COFFERS AND RIGHT NOW.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.639
ST AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN GREEN

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.540
TECHNOLOGY VERY BROAD AND I

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:19.208
UNDERSTAND YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:20.609
AT IT IS FOR THE FLAG THAT

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:21.710
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.512
HUGE RAMIFICATIONS AS WE MOVE

01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:24.546
FOR THAT ON IF WE'RE GONNA

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.448
CONFORM TO WHAT THE CURRENT

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:27.449
FEDERAL DEFINITION IS.

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:29.218
YES THAT'LL JUST MAKE ONE POINT

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:31.787
IN THAT IN THE INTEREST THIS OUT

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:34.289
BUT ONE THING THAT WE ALSO TAKE

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.891
INTO CONSIDERATION FINANCING OF

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.726
WE'VE SET OUT OUR GOALS.

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:38.293
FOR MAKING GET MAKING THIS

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.162
CHANG TO OUR TAX CODE WHICH

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.597
WOULD COST THE STATE MONEY AND

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:42.931
THOSE GOALS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.099
YOURS.

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:44.667
THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE VERY

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:46.735
ALIGNED AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:47.469
ONE THING THAT WE THINK A LOT

01:11:47.536 --> 01:11:49.238
ABOUT IS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.473
TAX CODE AND OF COURSE THE TAX

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.808
CODE IS VERY COMPLICATED ALWAYS.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.476
AND ALWAYS WILL BE --

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.778
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:57.379
WHEN YOU KNOW IT CAN BE HARD TO

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.614
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A

01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.648
TRANSPORTATIONPROJECTS.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.317
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.985
FALL INTO HOUSING WORE GREEN

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.753
JOBS BUT IF IT'S AN INFILL

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.255
TRANSPORTATION PROJECT IT COULD

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.456
HELP BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.857
SO FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.225
SIMPLICITY YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.560
THINKING ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:12.594
SENSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:15.030
MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS OR

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.298
DO WE CONFORM ON A BROADER SET

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.966
OF CATEGORIES LIKE YOU MENTIONED

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:18.734
THE PROPOSAL SOUNDS LIKE RIGHT

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.368
NOW.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.569
BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:21.670
EMPHASIS OF GOVERNMENT ARE

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:22.971
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.073
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.774
STEERING INVESTORS AND

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.876
HIGHLIGHTING PROJECTS TO GO IN

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:28.911
THE CATEGORIES THAT YOU OUTLINED

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:29.611
IN.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.879
THE CONVERSATION TO BE CONTINUED

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:34.516
ON THE ISSUE OF INCENTIVES --

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.151
THE STATE DOESN'T.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:41.423
ALWAYS AT HAS NOT ALWAYS HAD THE

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.125
BEST TRACK RECORD.

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:43.859
I'M GETTING ADDITIONAL

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.260
AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT WHEN IT

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:47.029
COMES TO INCENTIVES --

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:48.564
AND WHAT HS ENDED UP HAPPENING

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.299
IN YEARS PAST AYE AND WOULD LOOK

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.700
pTO BE A BE ABLE TO VERIFY THIS

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:52.768
AS WELL.

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:53.669
IS THAT WHAT IS INDEED UP

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.137
HALFPENNIES ONLY INCENTIVIZE

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.672
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD ITS

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.707
PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE

01:12:58.774 --> 01:12:59.842
PIPELINE AND BEEN APPROVED.

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:01.443
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.512
TO FIND NEW UNITS ABOVE AND

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.047
BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.615
PIPELINE AND OR HAS BEEN

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:07.716
APPROVED.

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.585
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I THINK

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:12.921
THAT'S TOUGH ON AND WANTED TO

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:13.522
MAKE SURE IF WE'RE GOING DOWN

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:16.258
THAT ROAD LEARN FROM THOSE

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:19.094
MISTAKES BECAUSE THERE OF MY

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.362
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN THE

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.197
PAST WE'VE ENDED UP SPENDING

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:24.333
HUNDREDS IF NOT OVER A BILLION

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.468
DOLLARS ON MOSTLY.

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.771
PRE APPROVED PROJECTS BUT NO

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.839
PROJECTS THAT ARE NEW BECAUSE

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.574
THEN CENTER PROGRAM.

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.877
SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:35.644
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:38.213
IN ON THE LAST ITEM ME AND IN

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.047
MADAM CHAIR.

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.450
IS ON A PERMANENT SOURCE FOR

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.418
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:45.087
LOOK WE HAVE --

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.622
ELEVEN TO TWELVE BILLION MOVING

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:47.256
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN THE

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.091
STATE.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.325
IN WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:51.493
GOVERNOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT --

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.461
CENTER BELL IN THIS ENTIRE

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.062
COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.230
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:13:55.297 --> 01:13:57.366
AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.802
SOMETHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.335
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:01.370
INTERNET LINES COMING IN WHICH

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.938
IS FANTASTIC. TO BE A TO MAKE A

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:05.040
DENT -- I

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.108
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WERE SOME

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:09.344
ABUSES IN RDA IN THE PAST THANK

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:09.978
WE NEED WE ARE LEARN FROM THOSE

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.246
MISTAKES.

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:12.815
PUT SOME TIGHT --

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:15.184
PARAMETERS AROUND.

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.485
WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING THIS TO

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.152
BE A BE ABLE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:17.753
HOUSING?

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.223
AND AT A MINIMUM PUT A TEN TO

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.258
TWENTY YEAR TIME FRAME SO THAT

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.359
WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THESE UNITS

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:24.693
BUILT.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.928
BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:27.663
GONNA CONTINUE TO RUN INTO OUR

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:28.764
DEVELOPERS COMING TO US AND

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:29.731
SAYING THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:30.966
TO BUILD WITHIN THOSE THREE

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:31.800
CATEGORIES.

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:35.304
VERY LOW LOW AND MOD WITHOUT

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.941
HAVING A PERMANENT SOURCE.

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:39.474
AS YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:40.709
FEEDBACK ON THAT.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.177
SO RIGHT NOW THAT SOMETHING

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.079
FINDING I'M GOING MONEY IS IS

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.714
ALWAYS A CHALLENGE SO WE WILL

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:46.949
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.183
CONSTANTLY MONITORING THE BUDGET

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.818
AND ONCE REVENUES COMING IN

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:51.920
APRIL WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.722
OF WHERE THINGS ARE.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.123
THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATED

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:55.891
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SENATOR STONE'S

THE FIRST IS ON THE POINT THAT

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:23.198
YOU RAISED AT THE BEGINNING

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.132

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.051
CHANGES.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.619
AND PERMITTING CHANGES AND EVEN

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.555
ALL THIS TOGETHER MAY NOT AMOUNT

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:47.556

CAUGHT THERE JUST AS THE BUDGET.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.430

DOESN'T GET TO WHERE CALIFORNIA

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:06.875
NEEDS TO BE EVEN ON AN ANNUAL

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.376

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:18.940
OKAY WILL BE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.742

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:27.349
REGARD TO PROVIDING HOUSING.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:28.383
FOR HOMELESS THE HOMELESS

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:29.784
POPULATION HIGH --

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.586
I I I LIKE TO SAY I AGREE WITH

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:32.954
MY FRIEND --

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.856
SENATOR BILL THAT IF WE'RE GOING

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.091
TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL.

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:37.125
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:39.494
HAVE A STRONG MENTOR MENTAL

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.263
HEALTH FUNDING --

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.530
OTHERWISE WE'RE RECREATING

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.232
BASICALLY AN ASYLUM WHICH WE

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:45.667
DON'T WANT MENTAL ASYLUMS WE

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.735
WANT PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GET

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.270
COVER WHERE PEOPLE GET

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.804
APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:51.840
SERVICES AND SO IT HAS TO BE A

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.975
CONJOINED A CONJOINED EFFORT AND

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:54.843
I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.678
WILL LOOK AT THAT AS A MORE THAN

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.280
A ONE PRONGED ISSUE.

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.982
AND THEN FOR THE LA --

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.618
IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN YOU

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.453
DID A STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT THE

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.989
COST OF BUILDING HOUSING IN THE

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.391
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.393
BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY FIVE

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:13.528
THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.363
THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.098
HAVE YOU --

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:18.667
UPDATED THAT STUDY DO YOU KNOW

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:20.535
WHAT IT COST RIGHT NOW WITH I

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.536
MEAN WE HAVE.

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.838
SOLAR PANELS WE'RE ADDING ON NOW

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.073
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE OTHER

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.075
INSPECTIONS AND MORE COST WHAT

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.109
NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BE

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:29.311
MORE GREEN IN CALIFORNIA.

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:33.882
BUT EVERY INCREMENTAL ADDITION.

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.550
TO OUR HOME EXPENSES PUSHING

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.951
MORE PEOPLE OUT OF THE REALM OF

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.787
AFFORDABILITY SO COULD YOU TELL

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.723
US WHERE WE ARE WITH RESPECT OR

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.260
COMPETITION.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.062
WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:48.363
DONE A DETAILED ANALYSIS TO

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.799
UPDATE THAT FIFTY TO SEVENTY

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:51.433
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR NUMBER THE

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.201
REFERENCE SINCE OUR TWENTY

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.036
FIFTEEN REPORT HOWEVER I THINK.

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:55.704
I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.372
THAT THE MOST SIGNS ARE POINTING

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.573
TO THAT THE NUMBERS ARE PROBABLY

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.908
SOMEONE HIGHER THAN THAT NOW

01:22:59.974 --> 01:23:01.076
WHERE WE SIT TODAY --

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.111
HOME THAT MOST OF THE FACTORS

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:05.480
THAT THAT FEED INTO THAT --

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.481
AS YOU MENTIONED --

01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:07.382
BUILDING CODES --

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:11.152
OR LABOR IN THE CONSTRUCTION

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.887
MARIE COULD MATERIALS COSTS ALL

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.122
THOSE THINGS --

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.358
HAVE BECOME PROBABLY MORE COSTLY

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:17.659
SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN I DON'T

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:18.760
HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR YOU

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.328
OKAY SO --

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.097
IT THIS IS JUST ANOTHER A

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.331
VARIABLE.

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:24.833
AMONGST MANY IF WE'RE TRULY

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.501
GOING TO BE IN CITING

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:27.836
COMPETITION TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:30.438
HOUSING CITY CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.806
GOING TO TAKE SOME.

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:33.341
PAIN IF YOU WILL BY MANY

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.642
ENTITIES TO TO DELIVER THE

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.077
AMERICAN DREAM HERE IN IN THE

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:38.813
STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.215
CAM THE LAST --

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:42.450
ISSUE A IS CAPITALIZE AGO WITH

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:43.385
MY FRIEND --

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.487
CENTER MCGUIRE WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:48.656
WAS OPPORTUNITIES OWNS --

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:49.691
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS TO BE

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:50.925
A A NARROW FOCUS ON OUR

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.694
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND A LOT OF

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.928
PEOPLE BELIEVE OR NOT DON'T KNOW

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.197
WHAT OPPORTUNITIES OWNS EVEN ARE.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.866
BUT IT IS A MECHANISM WHERE AN

01:23:57.932 --> 01:24:00.201
INVESTOR COULD DIFFER A THEIR

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.870
CAPITAL GAINS IF YOU WILL

01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:03.505
UNDERSTAND FOR TEN YEARS FROM.

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:05.073
UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX MAYBE

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.408
THEY GET SOME EXTENSIONS TO TO

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:07.442
NEGATE THEIR AFTER TAX

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.412
ALTOGETHER BUT IT'S IT'S AN%

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.280
ALTERNATIVE TO TEN THIRTY ONE

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:14.015
EXCHANGE BUT IT'S MORE BROAD AND

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.150
YOU CAN GET INVESTMENTS IN AREAS

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:15.583
THAT.

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:18.653
TYPICALLY NEEDED LIKE OLD

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.623
REDEVELOPMENT SOME TWEAKING TO

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:22.957
IT WOULD GIVE THE ASSURANCES TO

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:24.926
MY COLLEAGUE THAT --

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:26.428
WE'RE NOT --

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:28.129
JUST MAKING THE RICH RICHER WERE

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.097
WERE WERE ACTUALLY DOING OUR

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:30.498
BEST TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.433
HOUSING --

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.170
STATE TREASURY --

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:36.304
I THINK OPPORTUNITIES OWNS OR

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.639
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.442
FURTHER REFINE ON AND ULTIMATELY

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:41.576
ONCE WE GET A REFINED IS.

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:42.944
TO TO PROMOTE THIS MODALITY OF

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.513
INVESTMENT BECAUSE IT JUST CAN'T

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.181
BE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO SOLVE

ALL OF THE DISCUSSION I WANT TO

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.451
COME AT THIS FROM A LITTLE BIT

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.820
DIFFERENT ANGLE --

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:28.156
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HOUSING AND

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.557
HOMELESSNESS AND THE CHALLENGES

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.892
I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.660
THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:33.928
IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.129
ENOUGH HOUSING? FOR WHAT I

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:36.531
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY TALK ABOUT

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:39.133
HIS WAGES WE DO NOT IN MY

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.102
OPINION ESTIMATION DO A GOOD

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:42.871
ENOUGH JOB OF PUSHING BACK ON

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.339
COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:45.640
WE GOT VERY EXCITED WITH

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.008
OURSELVES WHEN WE PASS THE

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.510
MINIMUM WAGE A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:49.644
AGO WHICH HASN'T TOTALLY GONE

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.879
INTO EFFECT.

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.313
BUT IN A COUPLE YEARS WORKERS

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:56.417
WERE. FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IF

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:57.685
YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK FULL

01:25:57.752 --> 01:26:00.822
TIME COMES OUT TO TWO THOUSAND

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:01.990
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.024
WHERE I LIVE IN THE INLAND

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.659
EMPIRE WHERE IT'S CONSIDERED TO

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.895
BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:09.163
AT APARTMENT AN OLDER APARTMENT

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.965
A ONE BEDROOM IS GOING TO COST

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.700
YOU FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:14.802

PART TIME WORKER FROM SIMPLE

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:16.638
TIME.

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:19.340
AND I MAKING TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:20.608
DOLLARS A MONTH GROSS.

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:21.776
HOW CAN I HAVE FOR THAT ONE

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.811
BEDROOM APARTMENT AT FOURTEEN

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:24.946
HUNDRED DOLLARS WE GET VERY

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.848
EXCITED WHEN PEOPLE MAKE

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:27.916
EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.318
THAT PENCILS OUT TO TWO THOUSAND

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:30.985
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS

BACK ON CORPORATIONS AND REQUIRE

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:38.426
THEM TO PAY A LIVING WAGE I

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.994
DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL EVER SOLVE

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.996
THIS PROBLEM I THINK WE CAN FIND

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.264
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:44.699
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WILL

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.668
CONTINUE TO BE FORCED TO MAKE

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:47.936
MORE DECISIONS AND BE A BIGGER

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.604
PART OF IT.

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.239
SO I JUST WANT TO ASK ALL OF US

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:53.207
TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THINK

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:55.109
ABOUT REAL WAGES AND MANY AND

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:57.011
WITH A LITTLE STORY.

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:58.880
BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

01:26:58.947 --> 01:26:59.914

FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR AND THAT WAS

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.122
THIRTY YEARS AGO I KNOW PEOPLE

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.857

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.025

NEW HOUSE --

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:21.970
PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS EARLIER IT

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:24.672
WAS.

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:26.007
TO WOW DO YOU THINK THAT HOUSES

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.875
COULD EVER GET TO BE FOUR

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.277
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:30.878

GENERATING WITH MAJOR AGE ARE

01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:26.473
INSUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY

ADDRESS THE CRISIS WE FACE.

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:32.379
AS I MENTIONED AS OF JANUARY OF

LAST YEAR.

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:36.016
THERE WERE OVER FIFTY THREE

IN FOUR YEARS.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.331
I DOUBT THAT SHARE AS THE

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:51.932
STATE'S HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:54.301

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:57.771

01:37:57.838 --> 01:38:01.008
FIRE FOR CONTINUING OF CARE AND

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:02.610
ARE TOO LARGE CITIES.

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:03.844
ARE BEING PUT TO USE IN MANY

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:05.646
IMPORTANT WAYS WITH THAT

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.648
COMPLIMENTED THE UTILIZING

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:09.683
EASTER MEASURE AGE FUNDING.

01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.718
AND THE SINGLE BIGGEST WAY IN

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:11.285
WHICH SAYS FANS ARE BEING

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:13.520
UTILIZED CURRENTLY ARE FOR INNER

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:14.555
MOUTH SCENE.

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.156
BUT CAPITAL COSTS AND OPERATING

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:18.425
COSTS.

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.693
SO IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR LOCAL

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:22.162
EXPERIENCE BOTH WITH THE CURRENT

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.631
GROUND IF HE BINDING.

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:26.433
AND THE OUR PRICE A LOCAL

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.402
MOVEMENT THAT I'VE DESCRIBED.

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:30.004
I'D LIKE TO SHARE FOR

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:31.605
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HELP THE

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:32.940
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.642
WILL CONSIDER.

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:35.609
AS YOU ADDRESS THE PROVISION.

01:38:35.676 --> 01:38:38.279
OF WHY --

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:40.948
HOPEFULLY VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONE

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:43.617
TIME FINDING TO LOCALITIES TO

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:46.020
HELP AS COMBAT HOMELESSNESS.

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:49.223
FIRST WE URGE YOU TO MAXIMIZE

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.591
THE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FINDING

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.026
THAT YOU PROVIDE.

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:54.495
WE UNDERSTAND THE REDDISH STAINS

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:56.196
TO COMMIT THE STATE TO AN

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.498
ONGOING FINING STORES THAT WE

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:59.300
WOULD OF COURSE VERY MUCH LIKE

01:38:59.366 --> 01:39:00.801
TO SEE ARE NOT GOING FINING

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:01.702
SHORES.

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.871
BUT IF THE ULTIMATE DECISION IS

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:05.839
ONE TIME WE ARE G. MAKE THE ONE

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:08.275
TIME POD AS LARGE AS POSSIBLE.

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:11.512
END TO ALIGN THE LENGTH OF TIME

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.113
OVER WHICH THAT FINING CAN BE

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.182
USED WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.984
THAT YOU PROVIDE AND TO ALSO

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.385
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:20.721
THE TIME FRAME FOR THE UTILIZED

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:22.990
ATION OF THE CURRENT HEAT

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.958
FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT

01:39:25.025 --> 01:39:26.293
HE FINING OF FIVE HUNDRED

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.128
MILLION DOLLARS IS EFFECTIVELY

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.931
AVAILABLE TO BE USED OVER TWO

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:33.000
FISCAL YEARS AND A LITTLEBIT OF

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.368
THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.436
IF FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE TIME

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:38.005
AMOUNT WERE A BILLION DOLLARS IT

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:40.107
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:42.042
THOSE FRIENDS TO BE USED OVER

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.876
FOUR YEAR PERIOD.

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.745
RATHER NEW TWO YEAR PERIOD THAT

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:47.047
WOULD NOT PRE THEN LOCALITIES

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:48.449
THAT COULD EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.284
THE FINDING MORE QUICKLY FROM

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:51.352
DOING CHAU.

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:53.721
BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR A

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:55.489
LONGER TERM.

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:59.560
APPROACH AND ADD THE POTENTIALLY

01:39:59.626 --> 01:40:01.595
MAXIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:04.098
THE UTILIZATION OF THAT ONE TIME

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.133
STATE FRIEND --

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.269
SECONDLY WE WOULD URGE THAT.

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:10.904
ANYONE TIME ST FUNDING FOR

01:40:10.971 --> 01:40:13.540
LOCALITIES INCLUDED IN THE FIX

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:14.975
YOUR NINETEEN TWENTY STATE

THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED.

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:30.391
RAPID RE HOUSING IS A CRITICAL

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:32.459
COMPLIMENTING ROOM HOUSING RAPID

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:33.961
RE HOUSING PROVIDES TIME LIMITED

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:36.330
RENTAL SUBSIDIES OF SIXTY TWENTY

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:41.235
DAHLE TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:43.737
GAINING A REGAINING THE ABILITY

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.005
TO PAY THEIR OWN RIGHT.

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.807
TYPICALLY FOR EMPLOYMENT THOSE

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.842
SET IN SOME INSTANCES THROUGH

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.444
FEDERAL DISABILITY BENEFITS AS

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.645
WELL.

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:55.883
BEING ABLE TO EXPAND RAPID.

01:40:55.949 --> 01:40:58.051
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:40:58.118 --> 01:40:59.586
AND THE INFUSION OF A

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:00.621
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF STATE

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:02.489
FINING THAT COULD ONLY BE USED

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:03.657
FOR IN YOUR MOUTH SEEN.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.526
COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:06.794
CREATING AN IMBALANCE IN OUR

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.163
SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE IMBALANCE

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:10.497
THAT WOULD RESULT.

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.599
IF HOSPITALS INCREASED EMERGENCY

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:15.135
ROOM BEDS BUT DDN'T INCREASE

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:16.737
THE NUMBER OF BEDS FOR PEOPLE TO

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:19.239
GO FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOMS IN

01:41:19.306 --> 01:41:20.073
OTHER WORDS EXPANDING

RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO PAY FOR

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:26.780
PERMANENT HOUSING HAS THE EFFECT

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:29.516
AS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.285
PEOPLE LIVING IN SHELTER.

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.454
WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:36.123
MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:37.558
LEADING THEIR TO BE BOTH AN

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.159

NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:47.134
BECAUSE THEIR PEOPLE TODAY ON

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.368
THE STREET COULD MOVE AND IN OUR

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:49.436

THE CURRENT HEAP AT FINDING

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:45.893
CARRIED WITH IT A REQUIREMENT.

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:48.295
FOR CITIES TO ADOPT EMERGENCY

BY EVERYTHING A BUNCH OF MERS

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:34.487
WERE EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:35.555
THE LEGISLATURE ENSURING THAT WE

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:36.856
SHOW THAT THE GOLDEN STATE IS

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:38.358
ACTUALLY TRULY A GOLDEN STATE

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:39.859
FOR ALL I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS

01:51:39.926 --> 01:51:40.994
IDEA.

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.695
OF CALIFORNIA BEING AGAIN THIS

AND A STATE.

01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:48.034
I STRUGGLE WITH THIS IDEA THAT

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.536
WERE REVOLUTIONARY AND

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.571
STOCKPILING A BASIC INCOME WHEN

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:52.605
FOLKS WHO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM

01:51:52.672 --> 01:51:54.207
BASIC INCOME CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:55.708
CAN'T CAN'T AFFORD RENT.

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:56.876
I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS WITH THIS

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:58.411
IDEA THAT THAT EVERYTHING'S

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.679
GREAT AND SUNNY THERE'S A LOT OF

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:00.280
GOOD THINGS BE PRAGUE OF BUT

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:02.315
AGAIN THE FOLKS I REPRESENT

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:03.483
FOLKS FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:04.751
ACTUALLYCOME FROM.

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:06.653
MY OWN FAMILY MEMBERS MY MOTHER

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.521
ACCEPTED A CONSULAR CALLING IN

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:09.522
SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.524
HOUSING TO RENT KEEPS RISING THE

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:13.159
RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH AND WHAT'S

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:23.136
THE PLAN A STRATEGY --

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:23.770
FOR FOR ROUTING ADDRESSING IT SO

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.872
SOME THE IDEAS WE'VE HEARD THIS

01:52:25.939 --> 01:52:27.373
MEET FROM THE FUNDING SHORTFALLS

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.942
WI FI I'M TRYING TO BUILD

01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:30.643
AFFORDABLE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:32.011
HOUSING FOR PEOPLE --

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:34.114
I THINK TAX INCREMENT FINANCING

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.415
FOR FOR A HOUSING PROJECTS OR

01:52:35.482 --> 01:52:36.282
SOMETHING --

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:37.951
MANY CITIES IN CONSUMER CARE TO

01:52:38.017 --> 01:52:39.719
BE VERY INTERESTED IN --

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:41.988
I THINK OTHER STATE AGENCY TO

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.423
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:44.724
BUT THE WINNER TO MAKE CALTRANS

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.025
COULD BE HUGE SPACE WITH ALL THE

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.927
STATE OWNED LAND.

01:52:47.994 --> 01:52:49.162
ON THAT'S OFTENTIMES BAKING AND

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:51.131
USED OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.465
ALMONDS SOCCER MATCHES UNDER

01:52:52.532 --> 01:52:54.234
UNDER PASSES BUT OUR FAIRGROUNDS

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.268
EXETER THERE'S PLACES WHERE WE

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.769
COULD DO SOME REALLY COOL WORK

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:57.670
AROUND PERMITS SUPPORTIVE

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:58.271
HOUSING.

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:00.039
AND HOUSING FIRST FOR FOR

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:01.407
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK.

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:02.909
I'M GLAD THIS COMMITTEES TALKING

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:04.544

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:06.646
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE AS YOU ALL

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:11.751
THEY'RE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:13.786
AGAIN PRODUCTIONS NOT NOT SIMPLY

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:16.256
ENOUGH WE COULD BUILD ALL THE

01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:16.990

CAPACITY TO DO SO THESE COMPLEX

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:13.246

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:33.226
BUT THIS WAY BECAUSE TIME --

01:55:33.293 --> 01:55:34.027
I'M DOUG TO MAKE ON THE

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:36.496
PRESIDENT MERCY HOUSING

01:55:36.562 --> 01:55:38.998
CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO HERE AS IT

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:40.133
IS ON PRODUCTION AND

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.734
PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE

01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:42.769
HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:43.569
INCOME.

01:55:43.636 --> 01:55:44.704
HOUSEHOLDS --

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:45.872
SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:46.939
MERCY HOUSING SOME NOT --

01:55:47.006 --> 01:55:48.408
WE'RE A NONPROFIT HOUSING

01:55:48.474 --> 01:55:49.275
DEVELOPER WE WORK THROUGHOUT THE

01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:50.043
STATE.

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:51.411
I'M READING IN ROSEVILLE TO THE

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:53.313
BAY AREA DOWN TO SAN DIEGO AND

01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:54.681
LOS ANGELES IN BAKERSFIELD.

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.182
OR ACTIVE IN ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:57.550
COUNTIES IN THE STATE --

01:55:57.617 --> 01:55:59.352
WERE SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL IN THAT WE

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:00.787
DEVELOP BOTH FAMILY HOUSING

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.455
SENIOR HOUSING AND WHERE ONE OF

01:56:02.522 --> 01:56:03.856
THE LARGEST SUPPORTIVE HOUSING --

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.191
DEVELOPERS AND PROVIDERS IN THE

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.492
STATE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:07.827
SO WE SORT OF BRING A UNIQUE

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:09.762
PERSPECTIVE I THINK TO THE WORK

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:11.197
AND WORK WITH MANY GREAT

01:56:11.264 --> 01:56:12.365
JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:14.233
AND I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST I

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.501
JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK --

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:18.004
I'VE BEEN IN THIS FIELD FROM WAS

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:19.372
TWENTY FIVE YEARS --

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:20.006
I THINK I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:21.474
MOMENT WHERE THERE'S BEEN SUCH

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:22.575
CLEAR LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:23.843
LEVEL IN TERMS OF WANTING TO

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.111
MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THIS.

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.045
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S DUE TO THE FACT

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:27.580
THAT WE'VE DUG OURSELVES A HOLE

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:29.349
THAT IS BIGGER THAN ANY THAT

01:56:29.415 --> 01:56:30.383
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:31.050
AND I'M.

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:32.952
HOPEFULLY ANY MY KIDS LIVES --

01:56:33.019 --> 01:56:35.254
SO IT'S BOTH GOOD NEWS AND BAD

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:36.556
FOCUSED ON THIS --

01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:38.157
AS MANY PEOPLE OF ALLUDED TO

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:40.727
WE'VE GOT MASSIVE ISSUES AND YOU

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:41.594
KNOW WHAT IT'S COR ADDS IT COMES

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:42.829
DOWN TO A FEW THINGS --

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.263
ONE OF WHICH IS IS THE ABSOLUTE

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:45.431
SHORTAGE.

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:47.667
OF OF HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:48.835
THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.670
FOLKS ANYTHING UNLESS WE GET TO

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:51.037
THAT.

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:52.572
BASIC CORE CONCEPT WE'RE NOT

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:53.106
GOING TO REALLY SOLVE THE

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:54.674
PROBLEMS ON I'M HAPPY THAT SO

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.409
MUCH OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:58.010
REALLY FOCUSED ON PRODUCTION.

01:56:58.077 --> 01:56:59.379
AND I WANT TO JUST COMPLEMENT

01:56:59.445 --> 01:57:00.346
THE LEGISLATURE ON THE GREAT

01:57:00.413 --> 01:57:01.914
WORK THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST

01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:03.216
FEW YEARS IN TERMS TO HEAP.

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:05.585
AND SB TO AND ARE GREAT WORK

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:06.853
WITH MANY OF YOU AROUND THE

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:08.521
PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION ONE AND

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:09.188
TWO WERE EAGER TO GET THAT MONEY

01:57:09.255 --> 01:57:10.223
OUT THE DOOR --

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:12.191
I KNOW FOLKS HAVE TALKED ABOUT

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:13.126
WILL GOSH WE'VE GOT SO MUCH

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:15.061
MONEY FLOWING OUT WE POSSIBLY

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:15.628
NEED MORE COMING OUT OF THE

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:16.462
STATE BUDGET.

01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:17.930
I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT WE WE

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.799
WE WORK IN A BIZARRE FIELD IN

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.634
WHICH WE RATION OUT.

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.536
YOU KNOW A DOLLAR A YEAR. TO A

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:24.704
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS HUNDREDS AND

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.539
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS HUNDREDS OF

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:27.173
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE ACT

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:27.840
AS IF.

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:29.142
BY GIVING OUT SMALL AMOUNTS

01:57:29.208 --> 01:57:30.610
EVERY YEAR WE'RE GONNA DO

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:32.345
SOMETHING WE'RE TREADING WATER

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:33.346
AT BEST.

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:36.282
AND IT'S BEEN A LOT WORSE IN

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.651
RECENT YEARS.

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:40.319
WE SORT OF CHOOSE BETWEEN WHICH

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:41.721
OF THE DIFFERENT HOUSING

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.122
PROBLEMS WERE TRYING TO SOLVE OR

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:44.123
RESOVE IN HOMELESSNESS.

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:45.691
ARE WE SOLVING THE PROBLEM FOR

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:47.126
THE MINIMUM WAGE WORKER WE SOLVE

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:49.228
THE PROBLEM FOR THE SENIOR --

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.363
WE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT GOING TO

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:51.798
SUCCEED AS A STATE LESS WE DO

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:53.332
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AT ONCE --

01:57:53.399 --> 01:57:54.801
AND WE'RE NOWHERE CLOSE TO DOING

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:57.069
THAT AT THE MOMENT I I WILL SAY

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:57.703
I THINK THERE'S A TON OF THINGS

01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:58.404
IN THIS BUDGET.

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.239
BETTER FANTASTIC THAT WOULD GO A

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:01.908
LONG WAY TOWARDS US A JUST

01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:02.775
BRIEFLY MENTION THAT I THINK

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:03.242
THAT.

01:58:03.309 --> 01:58:04.844
THE FOCUS ON THE FLEXIBLE

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.579
OPERATING SUBSIDY POOL IS A

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.147
REALLY IMPORTANT PROPOSAL AND WE

01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:09.248
DO WORK AND IN LOS ANGELES

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.516
COUNTY AND I THINK.

01:58:10.583 --> 01:58:11.784
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:13.920
LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN

01:58:13.986 --> 01:58:14.587
THE STATE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:58:14.654 --> 01:58:15.321
IN THE COUNTRY.

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:16.923
I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE WELL

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:17.890
ORGANIZED APPROACH THAT THIS

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.792
WORK AND IF OTHER COUNTIES IN

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:20.927
THE STATE COULD COPY WHAT LOS

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:22.328
ANGELES IS DOING.

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:22.995
AND THEY COULD USE THAT

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:24.363
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MIMIC

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:26.432
WHAT IS BEING DONE AND THE STATE

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:27.900
COULD SOUND REINFORCE.

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:29.435
THE NEED TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:30.603
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT --

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.004
THE ANALOGY SOMEBODY MADE FROM

01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:33.639
THE OTHER DAYS LOS ANGELES IS A

01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:34.740
BIT LIKE GOING INTO AN APPLE

01:58:34.807 --> 01:58:36.042
STORE YOU WALK IN.

01:58:36.108 --> 01:58:37.009
YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE A

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:38.711
HOUSING DEVELOPER AND YOU WANT

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:40.112
DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT AS IN

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:41.414
THERE'S SUBSIDY FOR RENTS.

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:44.884
THERE'S MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:48.521
THIS CASE MANAGERS FROM EASY.

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:49.889
BUT IT'S ALL TOGETHER IN

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:51.557
CONTRAST MANY OF THE ECONOMY

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:53.226
THAT WE WORK AND GREAT LOCAL

01:58:53.292 --> 01:58:54.393
ELECTED OFFICIALS GREAT

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:55.695
APPOINTED STAFF.

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:57.396
BUT YOU REALLY GOING TO A

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:58.698
NINETEEN EIGHTIES YOU KNOW

01:58:58.764 --> 01:59:00.166
TECHNOLOGY STORE WHICH THEY SAY

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:01.634
I DON'T KNOW THE CPU MICHAEL

01:59:01.701 --> 01:59:02.702
WITH THIS MODEM I REALLY DON'T

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:03.536
KNOW.

01:59:03.603 --> 01:59:04.670
AND YOU SORT OF END UP GOING

01:59:04.737 --> 01:59:06.572
DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO FIGURE

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.074
OUT HOW TO CONNECT ALL THE DOTS.

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:08.608
THAT OUGHT TO BE CONNECTED

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:10.142
PROBLEMATICALLY AND SO I THINK

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:11.677
AS YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE MONEY

01:59:11.744 --> 01:59:12.845
THAT YOU'RE USING I THINK IT'S

01:59:12.912 --> 01:59:14.180
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

01:59:14.247 --> 01:59:15.281
PRICKLY THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:59:15.348 --> 01:59:16.148
DOLLARS IT'S BEING DELIVERED AS

01:59:16.215 --> 01:59:17.450
AN INCENTIVE TO LOCAL

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:20.052
GOVERNMENTS THAT YOU YOU DO MORE.

01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:21.654
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BECOMES A

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:22.788
LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE THE APPLE

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.357
STORE THAT IS LOS ANGELES AND A

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:25.725
LITTLE BIT LESS LIKE CRAZY

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:27.760
EDDIE'S OR WHATEVER WHATEVER

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:29.996
YOUR ANALOGY MY DAY --

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:30.630
I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT I

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:31.597
JUST WANT TO SAY I DO THINK THAT

01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:32.832
THAT THAT POOL OF FUNDS FOR

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:33.733
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS REALLY

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.334
IMPORTANT WE WORK WITH AND MANY

01:59:35.401 --> 01:59:36.669
AMAZING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:59:36.736 --> 01:59:38.671
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT IS NOT

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:39.772
UNUSUAL WHEN I TALK TO MY

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:42.041
COLLEAGUES TO YOUR ABOUT HUNDRED

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:44.443
THOUSAND HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:46.112
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IMPACT FEES.

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:47.246
FOUR INDIVIDUAL UNITS OF HOUSING

01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:48.447
SO WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A GIANT.

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:49.815
YOU KNOW HUNDRED UNIT OR TWO

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:50.449
HUNDRED UNIT OF YOU'RE TALKING

01:59:50.516 --> 01:59:51.984
ABOUT A LOCAL JURISDICTION

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:53.619
EFFECTIVELY [inaudible]

01:59:53.686 --> 01:59:54.453
WASHING.

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.123
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY. TO PAY

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.924
FOR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS AND I

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.991
DON'T THINK IS A STATE WE CAN

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.793
AFFORD THAT ANYMORE --

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:02.228
I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE THE

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:03.930
LEGISLATURE TAKES INACTION IN

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.197
THAT REGARD AND I THINK THAT

02:00:05.264 --> 02:00:05.865
FIGHTER MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:00:05.932 --> 02:00:07.166
INCENTIVES --

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:08.234
MIGHT BE A PLACE FOR YOU TO

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.302
THINK ABOUT WHERE YOU WOULD

02:00:09.368 --> 02:00:10.903
APPLY THAT AND WHERE THAT WOULD

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:12.071
GO O COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY.

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:13.573
DO SOMETHING TO EITHER REDUCE OR

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:15.308
WAIVE THOSE FEES I THINK WOULD

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:16.475
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.110
OF GOVERNMENTAL BEHAVIOR.

02:00:18.177 --> 02:00:19.512
MAKES A LITTLE BIT LESS

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:20.112
DIFFICULT FOR US TO EXPLAIN TO

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:23.015
VOTERS YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT.

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:24.350
YOU'RE ACTUALLY PAYING A HUNDRED

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:24.917
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PARKING

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.485
SCHOOL FEES WITH THE AFFORDABLE

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:27.620
HOUSING DOLLARS.

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:28.988
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:30.823
SOMETHING I'D RECOMMEND ON THE

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:31.724
ON THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:32.825
DOLLARS --

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:34.927
FOR NEW STATE TAX CREDITS THIS

02:00:34.994 --> 02:00:35.761
IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

02:00:35.828 --> 02:00:37.363
MEASURE WERE VERY EXCITED ONE

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:38.965
ECHO THE COMMENTS PLEASE PUT AS

02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:41.133
MUCH MONEY. ONE TIME AS YOU CAN

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.034
INTO THIS BUDGET IF YOU FEEL

02:00:42.101 --> 02:00:44.804
LIKE YOU CAN'T KEEP THINGS --

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:46.272
OBVIOUSLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE

02:00:46.339 --> 02:00:47.406
STATE TAX CREDIT RECORD THE LOW

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:48.808
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IS IN

02:00:48.874 --> 02:00:50.610
MANY WAYS THE BACKBONE.

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:51.777
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.179
ENTITIES IN PRACTICALLY EVERY

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.313
PROJECT IS BUILT AROUND THE

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.414
STATE --

02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:57.817
IT'S WE HAVE ABOUT THREE THIRTY

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:58.284
FIVE HUNDRED UNITS IN

02:00:58.351 --> 02:00:59.752
DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE AROUND

02:00:59.819 --> 02:01:00.353
THE STATE ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:01.153
COUNTIES.

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:01.921
I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVERYONE OF

02:01:01.988 --> 02:01:03.155
THOSE INVOLVED ALONG CANALS AND

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.291
TAX CREDIT AS ITS CORE FINANCE

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:06.492
AND IF THERE WERE MORE OF IT WE

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:08.260
WOULD BE BUILDING ARE PROJECTS

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:09.528
FASTER AND WE DELIVERING.

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:10.896
HOMES TO PEOPLE THAT NEED IT ONE

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:13.065
THING I I DO WANT TO SAY IS --

02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:14.000
YOU KNOW IT'S THE FIRST TIME

02:01:14.066 --> 02:01:15.534
WE'VE SEEN AN EMPHASIS ON THE

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:17.837
MODERN INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:19.171
IN THAT STATE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:20.106
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF MY

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:21.340
COLLEAGUES IN SAYING I THINK

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:22.808
THAT'S THE TIME HAS COME TO DO

02:01:22.875 --> 02:01:23.643
THAT KIND OF WORK AND I THINK

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:28.514
IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT MOVE

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:28.881
FORWARD ON THAT.

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:30.583
I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE LOW

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:34.020
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IT IS.

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.888
TO EIGHT THERE'S NO REASON THE

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:39.925
PROGRAM COULDN'T JUST THAT AND

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:41.761
I'M PROGRAM WHICH I THINK WOULD

02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:43.262
BE A DISSERVICE TO ALL OF THE

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:44.597
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE

02:01:44.664 --> 02:01:46.232
SO I'M SURE THAT --

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:47.767
MARINO WHINER RAY PEARL FROM THE

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.301
CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM TO

02:01:49.368 --> 02:01:50.336
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:51.470
THAT.

02:01:51.537 --> 02:01:52.838
AS YOU GET TO IT --

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:53.706
THIRTY THERE MANY OTHER THINGS I

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:55.574
WANTED TO SPEAK TO I GUESS I

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:57.476
JUST WANT TO FOCUS ON ON THE

02:01:57.543 --> 02:02:00.413
FACT THAT ON THE THE THE

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:01.580
CHALLENGE WE REALLY HAVE IS A

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:01.781
STATE.

02:02:01.847 --> 02:02:05.117
IS THAT. FOR EVERY PERSON THAT

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:09.088
MERCY HOUSING OR THE CITY LOS-ANGELES OR THE CITY STOCKTON.

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:10.690
GETS OUT OF HOMELESSNESS.

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:11.524
WE'VE GOT TWO MORE PEOPLE

02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:13.259
FALLING IN BECAUSE THAT THE

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:15.361
PROBLEMS ARE SO SEVERE --

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:17.063
AND I THINK WE WANT TO CAUTION I

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:18.464
THINK A LITTLE BIT AROUND

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.132
RUSHING TO THE SCENE OF THE FIRE.

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:21.767
AND NOT INVOLVING OURSELVES IN

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.235
FIRE PREVENTION --

02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:24.503
AND I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHERE

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:25.604
WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS THE STATE

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.073
AND I THINK CENTER SKINNER FOR

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:27.873
TO THIS EARLIER.

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:28.808
WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.543
POTENTIAL FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE

02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:32.545
AS A AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OF

02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:33.345
THE OTHER WORKERS ARE IN THE

02:02:33.412 --> 02:02:33.979
STATE?

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.347
WE WE SIMPLY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:36.615
THAT PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO

02:02:36.682 --> 02:02:38.317
HOMELESSNESS.

02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:39.118
MUCH FASTER THAN WE'RE GETTING

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:39.852
THEM OUT.

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.220
AND SO WE CAN'T SIMPLY AND WE'RE

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:44.323
A PERMANENT SO KLAY FOCUS ON

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:46.258
PERMITS FOR BOUGHS AND WHAT WE

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:47.226
SEE IN THE STATE IS THAT WE

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:50.429
ALMOST ROUTINELY IGNORE.

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:51.964
EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:53.833
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE NOT

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.167
IN THE SPECIALTY POPULATIONS

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:57.536
WHEN WE RUN. TO THE TO THE NEW

02:02:57.603 --> 02:02:59.238
TO THE NEW CRISIS OF THE DAY.

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.239
AND WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.574
THAT I I WOULD JUST TELL YOU

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.309
THAT THERE IS A REAL

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:03.609
[inaudible]

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:05.578
SHOCKING --

02:03:05.644 --> 02:03:06.679
LACK OF FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.080
WE HAVE THIS MASSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:09.515
CHANGE OF SENIORS YOU'RE ALL

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:10.483
AWARE THAT NOBODY HAS TO TELL

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:11.550
YOU WHAT THE BABY BOOM AS OF

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:13.252
THAT THE RETIRING --

02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:14.320
BUT WE HAVE ALMOST NOTHING

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:15.855
HAPPENING IN A CONCERTED WAY IN

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:17.356
TERMS OF FEDERAL OR STATE POLICY

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.591
TO ADDRESS.

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.326
THE FACT WE HAVE SO MANY SENIORS

02:03:20.392 --> 02:03:21.460
WHO ARE.

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.495
ARE ON THE EDGE OF HOMELESSNESS

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:23.796
AND FALLING ALMOST AS AND I

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:24.797
DON'T KNOW WHETHER SENIORS ARE

02:03:24.864 --> 02:03:25.965
IN FACT THE FASTEST GROWING PART

02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:27.166
OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION BUT

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:29.201
THEY'RE CERTAINLY AMONG THEM --

02:03:29.268 --> 02:03:30.102
AND THERE'S GOING TO GROW BIGGER

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:31.036
AND IT'S GOING TO GROW BIGGER

02:03:31.103 --> 02:03:32.838
BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY NOT TRYING

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:34.907
TO DO SOMETHING SPECIFIC AROUND

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:35.975
SENIOR HOUSING.

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:38.210
LASTLY I JUST WANNA.

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:39.411
I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A STORY

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:41.380
I USED TO BE THE HOUSING RECTOR

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.948
OF SAN FRANCISCO UNDER NOW GET

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:43.883
GOVERNOR KNEW SOME OF WHEN HE

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:47.119
WAS MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I

02:03:47.186 --> 02:03:48.921
REMEMBER BEING CALLED OUT --

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:51.323
WHEN THE PICO GROUPS AND IN SAN

02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:52.424
FRANCISCO HAS BEEN A MEETING AT

02:03:52.491 --> 02:03:53.993
ST ANTHONY'S CHURCH AND THE

02:03:54.059 --> 02:03:55.795
MISSION DISTRICT?

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:56.896
AND IT WAS A GROUP OF LARGE

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:57.596
LATINO HOUSEHOLDS.

02:03:57.663 --> 02:03:58.731
AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:00.399
HOMELESSNESS PREFERENCE THAT WE

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:02.134
HAD PUT ON A NEW BUILDING --

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:02.768
AND HOW IT WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:05.571
P. HOMELESS.

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:07.907
AND THIS WOMAN TURNED TO ME AND

02:04:07.973 --> 02:04:08.674
SHE SAID LOOK.

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:11.076
I SLEEP IN A ONE BEDROOM UNIT

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:12.812
WITH MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER.

02:04:12.878 --> 02:04:14.480
I AM NOT THROWN MYSELF ON THE

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:16.182
STREET I'M NOT THROW MYSELF IN A

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:17.416
SHELTER.

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:18.851
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

02:04:18.918 --> 02:04:20.820
I WORK IN A REALLY HARD JOB AND

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:21.387
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:23.422
EXCLUDED FROM HAVING A SHOT AT

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.224
THIS HOUSING.

02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:25.858
BECAUSE I'M DOING ALL THE RIGHT

02:04:25.925 --> 02:04:26.258
THINGS [inaudible]

02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:29.428
AND YEAH I MEAN YOU COULD TELL

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:31.497
THAT THAT WAS A AN INCREDIBLY

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:32.698
POWERFUL MOMENT FOR ME

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:33.899
PERSONALLY --

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:36.001
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY%

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:37.102
ABOUT THAT YOU JUST RECOGNIZE

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:39.171
THE INHERENT LACK OF WISDOM OF

02:04:39.238 --> 02:04:40.472
YOUR OWN OF YOUR OWN POLICY

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:42.074
MAKING AT THAT MOMENT --

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:43.108
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT'S

02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:45.344
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON A

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:47.079
SYSTEM A SCARCITY --

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:47.646
AND IF WE WERE WORKING THE

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.448
SYSTEM A SCARCITY I WOULDN'T OF

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:50.249
HAD TO FACE THAT WOMAN DOWN AND

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:51.951
SAY I GOT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN.

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:52.985
THIS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:54.186
INDIVIDUAL IT'S COSTING A

02:04:54.253 --> 02:04:56.021
HOSPITAL A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:04:56.088 --> 02:04:56.555
DOLLARS A YEAR AND YOU WHO

02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:57.523
AREN'T --

02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:58.724
BUT THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE FIND

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.893
OURSELVES IN A STATE AND I THINK

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.161
IF THIS BUDGET MOVES FORWARD AND

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.629
CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK.

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.697
THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE TRYING

02:05:04.763 --> 02:05:05.865
TO DO RIGHT THE LEGISLATURE WE

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:07.333
WON'T HAVE TO FACE AS MANY OF

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:08.834
THOSE CHOICES IN THE FUTURE.

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:09.802
SO I REALLY GREATLY ENCOURAGE

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:12.238
YOU TO CONTINUE TO FIND AS MUCH

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:13.072
OF THIS WORK IS YOU CAN DO.

02:05:13.138 --> 02:05:14.540
ENCOURAGE MUCH OF THE LOCAL

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:17.676
GOVERNMENT AND WITH THAT

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.879
INCENTIVE FUND SO THANK YOU.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE LA --

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:31.924
DOCTOR THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US

02:05:31.991 --> 02:05:34.760
TODAY BUT ON THE FINAL PAGE PAGE

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:36.428
NINE THEY GAVE US A SHEET --

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:37.897
THAT'S AND TITLE CONVERSATIONS

02:05:37.963 --> 02:05:39.732
ON HOUSING HOMELESSNESS AND IT

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:40.966
REALLY IS JUST KIND OF SOME

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:43.402
BULLETS IN TERMS OF AREAS --

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:44.937
THAT THEY SUGGESTED WE SHOULD

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:48.574
TAKE A LOOK AT AND AND IS

02:05:48.641 --> 02:05:49.208
MORALITY KNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:52.177
THEM ARE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL --

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:53.913
REFORMING LOCAL ZONING LAWS

02:05:53.979 --> 02:05:55.681
ALTERED ALLOCATION OF LOCAL

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:57.483
TAXES AND FOR MORNING IF YOU

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:58.951
WOULD JUST COMMENT --

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:01.453
FROM A LOCAL LEADERS PERSPECTIVE --

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.488
THERE'S BEEN A PIECE OF

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:04.957
LEGISLATION INTRODUCED HERE --

02:06:05.024 --> 02:06:06.992
THAT AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT WAS

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:10.963
NOT RECEIVED WARMLY --

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:13.732
THAT GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.801
AND HAVE A MORE DIRECT OVERSIGHT

02:06:15.868 --> 02:06:18.203
OVER LOCAL ZONING SO WHAT WHAT

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:19.939
SAY YOU.

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:26.745
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

02:06:26.812 --> 02:06:30.115
WHAT WILL ALSO BE FOR FOR

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:32.217
STOCKTON AND START --

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:33.652
BECAUSE I DO THINK TO TO THE

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:33.986
POINT LA --

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:35.020
REPORT TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THE

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:36.388
LOCAL ZONING LAWS MAKE IT

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.856
DIFFICULT --

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.058
FOR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.893
ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THAT SO MUCH

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:41.660
AND STOCKTON BACK AT SEEING

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:42.795
OTHER COMMITTEES TO DO THE RIGHT

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:44.997
THING AND ALLOW ZONING FOR FOUR

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:46.432
FOUR MILES AND SO I DO THINK.

02:06:46.498 --> 02:06:48.033
GIVEN THE CRISIS WERE FACING IT

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.101
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:51.537
STEP THE STATE TO STEP IN --

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:54.440
I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THE

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.342
GOVERNOR IS DOING IN TERMS OF

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.477
USING A STAKE IN SOME CASES WITH

02:06:58.544 --> 02:06:59.812
CITIES TO COMPEL THEM THE BILL.

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:00.379
TO THE CAN JUST BE A COUPLE

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.113
CITIES.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.681
WHO HAVE IN MY TWO LEADERS OR

02:07:02.748 --> 02:07:04.950
WHATEVER WHO TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

02:07:05.017 --> 02:07:07.019
HOUSING PERHAPS EVERY CITY EVERY

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:08.487
CITY EXCUSE ME HAVE TO PULL?

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:09.254
THEIR OWN WAYS ARE FROM THE

02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:10.422
LOCAL LEVEL I THINK.

02:07:10.489 --> 02:07:11.890
WE WE WE APPRECIATE A TIMING

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:13.392
ABILITY TO MOVE AND I THINK THAT

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:14.927
THERE INCREASING OUR CASES OF

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.161
DOLLARS TO HELP US MAKE PRODUCTS

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.663
PENCIL OUT MAKES IT MUCH MORE

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:18.497
EASIER.

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:20.265
ON TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:22.234
WITH WITH CONSTITUENTS BY THINK.

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:25.471
NOT JUST IN FROM A LOCAL LEVEL

02:07:25.537 --> 02:07:28.374
BY THE STATE WE HAVE TO SOME OF

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.708
ITS FOR STRIKING TO ME HOW

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:31.076
OFTENTIMES THE ZONING LAWS

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:32.711
HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY HAVE

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:34.313
BEEN USED TO DISENFRANCHISE IN

02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:35.314
MARCH RIGHT.

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.215
POOR PEOPLE PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:36.815
EXCEPT DURING I THINK AT THE

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:38.617
STATE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:39.752
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.487
THAT IT'S IN POINTS HAVE LOCAL

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:42.988
CONTROL LOCAL AUTONOMY.

02:07:43.055 --> 02:07:44.356
ON BUT BUT THERE THERE IS AN

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:45.858
ISSUE WHEN I LOOK WHICH ARE A

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:48.060
LOCAL ATTORNEY IS A POLICY WALL.

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:52.097
IF YOU WILL THAT THE BLOCKS AND

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:54.833
LEAVE THE SOME PEOPLE OUT.

THANK YOU AND I AND I CAN I

02:07:57.336 --> 02:07:57.936
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE'RE ALL

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:58.670
GOING TO DO THINGS VERY

02:07:58.737 --> 02:07:59.438
DIFFERENTLY AND AND MAKE IT

02:07:59.505 --> 02:08:00.639
REALLY TOUGH PERHAPS YOU KNOW

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:01.507
POLITICALLY.

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:03.475
DICEY DECISIONS CAN YOU TALK A

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:05.144
LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR BASIC

02:08:05.210 --> 02:08:07.146
INCOME PROJECT THAT YOU'RE DOING

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:09.681
AND STOCKED IN AN AND IT BECAUSE

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:11.316
I THINK ABOUT IT AS A OUT OF THE

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:12.351
BOX.

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:14.453
KIND OF STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.087
THE CORE ISSUES WERE TRYING TO

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:17.122
ADDRESS JAN AND I THINK A LOT OF

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.323
IT WE SEE REFLECT THE IN THE

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:20.225
EITC ECCENTRIC MENTIONED IN THE

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:22.061
IN IN THIS BUDGET EVEN DATA

02:08:22.127 --> 02:08:22.828
DIVISION --

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:25.731
IDEA BUT ESSENTIALLY --

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:27.733
IT'S AN OLD ALMOST AS AN IDEAL

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.234
MRS OF THE UNION FOR THOMAS

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:30.402
PAINE WAS TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:31.670
LATE SEVENTEEN HUNDREDS --

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:33.072
DOCTOR KING --

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:34.506
SOCIALIST LIKE MILTON FRIEDMAN A

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:35.641
REGION NEXEN ALSO WERE WERE

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:37.109
FLIRTING WITH THE WITH THIS IDEA

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:38.444
IN IN THAT PROBLEM TO TRY TO

02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:40.045
SOLVE IT I THINK WHEN YOU

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:41.213
SINNERS MICHIGAN A WAGE IS NOT

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.314
INCREASING --

02:08:42.381 --> 02:08:44.049
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT'S IN

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:45.117
A GREAT NATION A DESTINATION

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:46.685
WILL NATION IS THERE ANY EXCUSE

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:47.920
FOR PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE JUST NOT

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:49.354
THAT LUXURIES WITH NECESSITIES

02:08:49.421 --> 02:08:56.962
TAKEN CARE OF SO WE PARTNER WITH

02:08:57.029 --> 02:08:59.565
THE GROUP CUT ECONOMIC SECURE

02:08:59.631 --> 02:09:01.733
FORTY ONE FORTY FIVE EMERGENCY.

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.068
WHICH IS A RATE INCREASE IN TWO

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:05.671
QUARTERS FOR OF FOR FOR EXAMPLE

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:07.072
TO SEE WHAT WE LOOK LIKE TO HAVE

02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:07.739
IT -- THE

02:09:07.806 --> 02:09:09.842
IDEA WERE ABLE TO RAISE AN AWFUL

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:11.043
IMPROPER LEASE WOULD HAVE TO USE

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:11.910
TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR THIS

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:12.978
DEMONSTRATION BUT STARTING

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:15.347
FRIDAY A HUNDRED THIRTY FAMILIES

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:16.682
SELECTED FROM THROUGHOUT THE FOR

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:17.950
THE CITY --

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:18.784
WHO ALL LIVE IN THE

02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:19.885
NEIGHBORHOODS ADDER BELOW THE

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:22.187
CITY'S MEDIAN OF FORTY SIX

02:09:22.254 --> 02:09:22.588
THOUSAND DOLLARS?

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:24.056
ALSO SOME MAY BE MORE THAN THAT

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.491
SOME MAKE LESS BUT THEY ALL LIVE

02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:26.658
IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THAT'S

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:28.460
THE MEDIAN INCOME ARGUMENT FIVE

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:30.395

AGAIN TO YOUR POINT SENATOR.

02:09:32.998 --> 02:09:35.033
THE IDEA IS NOT TO BE BOLD FOR

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.201
BEING BOLD FAKE ABOUT

02:09:36.268 --> 02:09:37.402
TRANSMITTING TWO YEARS IN

CARE AND IT'S LIKE ALL THESE

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:00.325
FOLKS.

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.127
WHO ARE NEARLY WORKING WORKING

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.395
THEMSELVES TO DEATH FOURTEEN

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:04.062
SIXTEEN HOUR DAYS I REMEMBER ONE

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:04.796
TIME I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE

CALL RANGE CHILD CARE BECAUSE

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:10.335
SHE HAD LEFT HER CHILD AT HOME

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:11.703
ALONE A SEVEN YEAR OLD BECAUSE

02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:13.105
SHE'S GOT THIS NOTIFICATION SHE

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:13.605
THOUGHT.

02:10:13.672 --> 02:10:15.741
IT WOULD BE A BIG BIG TRIP

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:16.308
ANOTHER THE TRADE OFFS THAT

02:10:16.375 --> 02:10:18.844
FOLKS THEY'RE MAKING EVERYDAY SO

02:10:18.911 --> 02:10:20.445
THAT'S WHAT KIND OF MOTIVATES

02:10:20.512 --> 02:10:22.614
THAT WORK IN BUT IS ALSO.

02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:24.850
A BELIEF IN THE EYE IN THE AGAIN

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:27.019
TO MY EARLIER POINT THIS IDEA OF

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.754
THE INHERENT DIGNITY.

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.622
OF PEOPLE IN IN HUMAN BEINGS IN

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:32.291
SOMETHING AS SMALL.

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:33.692
AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:34.459
LOSING IT SINCE THE EARNED

02:10:34.526 --> 02:10:36.295
INCOME TAX CREDIT AGAIN --

ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:16:29.347 --> 02:16:30.949
HAVE CREATE PRESSURE TO MAKE

02:16:31.016 --> 02:16:32.217

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:34.853
THAT.

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.221
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS A VISCERAL

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:38.256
REACTION WHEN THEY SEE HOMELESS

02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:39.524

ESPECIALLY IN IN OUR SOCIETY SO

02:16:55.106 --> 02:16:55.640
I THINK.

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:57.842
IT'S AN EDUCATION AROUND BECAUSE

02:16:57.909 --> 02:16:58.944

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:01.513
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:02.514
THE BOOGIE MAN.

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:04.616
IF WE DON'T WANT TO SEE PEOPLE

02:17:04.683 --> 02:17:05.216
ON OUR STREETS THAT FOLKS NEED

02:17:05.283 --> 02:17:08.386
TO BE ABLE FOR TWO THOUSAND

02:17:08.453 --> 02:17:10.355
DOLLARS AND FOR SOME PEOPLE

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:10.989

I MASS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN BUT I

02:17:20.999 --> 02:17:22.200

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:23.501
CONCRETELY IT'S REALLY YES.

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:24.803
ORGANIZING INCREASING PRESSURE

02:17:24.869 --> 02:17:26.671
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN UNACCEPTABLE

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:27.505
SANTA TAKE YOUR SAY YOU KNOW

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:28.139
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE ME TO LIVE IN

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:29.741
THE CITY I LIVE IN.

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:33.278
AND AND HELP THE MAYOR SEE THE

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:34.746
SEE THE LIGHT ANOTHER QUESTION

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:35.747
FOR YOU MISTER MERRETT IS THAT

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.148
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I TALKED

02:17:37.215 --> 02:17:38.350
ABOUT EARLIER WITHDREW THE CDG

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:39.217
PROGRAM I THINK IT OCCURRED.

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:41.186
RIGHT BEFORE YOU BECAME --

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.854
YOUR TENURE AS LOOKED AT FISHEL

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:45.056
BUT I THINK THE CD BG PROGRAM

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.292
WAS ONE OF THE MAIN STREAMS. FOR

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:50.228
FUNDING FOR HOUSING RELOCATION

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:52.664
PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS ALL THOSE.

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:55.133
OF THIS COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.269
IN LOW INCOME AREAS --

02:17:58.336 --> 02:17:59.904
USE.

02:17:59.971 --> 02:18:00.505
NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.406
WITHDRAW FROM THAT AND ALL THE

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:03.074
OTHER FEDERAL HOUSING PROGRAMS.

02:18:03.141 --> 02:18:04.476
WHAT THINGS DO YOU THINK THE

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:08.279
STATE SHOULD DO TO STEP IN TO

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:12.017
THE OUT LOS THE UNDERPINNING OF

02:18:12.083 --> 02:18:13.218
OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

02:18:13.284 --> 02:18:14.252
DEVELOPMENT.

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:15.987
BECAUSE WE GO TALK ABOUT THE

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:17.622
STATE ROLE THE FEDERAL ROLE.

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:19.791
AND THE CITY ROLE IN THE COUNTY

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:20.258
ROLE.

02:18:20.325 --> 02:18:22.961
SO HOW HOW WOULD YOU --

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:24.295
HOW WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT AND

02:18:24.362 --> 02:18:25.964
DID YOU THINK THE CD BG PROGRAM

02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:27.499
WAS -- A

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:30.402
GOOD MODEL.

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:33.171
A LOVE SEAT CBG AND TO YOUR

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.606
POINT WE NEVER HAVE ENOUGH SO

02:18:34.673 --> 02:18:35.206
AGAIN THERE'S ALL THESE GREAT

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:36.408
PROJECTS.

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:37.709
IN WHEN THE FROM THE MALL.

02:18:37.776 --> 02:18:38.410
AND THEY WERE IN AND ABLE TO

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:40.712
SERVE IN TERMS OF THE STATE.

02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:42.414
I KNOW THE REVENUE PROJECTED

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.848
REVENUES HAVEN'T COMING AS WE

02:18:43.915 --> 02:18:45.417
EXPECTED BUT I THINK AT SOME

02:18:45.483 --> 02:18:46.418
POINT A CONVERSATION ABOUT WE'RE

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:48.820
DOING CANNABIS REVENUES TO GO.

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:51.456
ON THAT'S IN LINE WITH VALUES

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:54.359
AND PRIORITIES MAKE ME EXTREMES

02:18:54.426 --> 02:18:55.660
ARE FROM BEFORE YOU GUYS.

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:57.796
ON BUT I WOULD SAY.

02:18:57.862 --> 02:19:00.098
THAT JUST WITH NO PRIOR RESEARCH

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:01.066
I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE IS A

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.400
NEW REVENUE STREAM IT HAS BEEN

02:19:02.467 --> 02:19:04.936
ALLOCATE TOTALLY TO ANYTHING YET

02:19:05.003 --> 02:19:06.104
TO SEE.

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.572
EPIDEMIC THE NUMBER ONE CRISIS

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:09.474
FACING THE STATE IT MAY MAKE

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:10.041
SENSE TO DIVERSE SOME THOSE

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:10.942
DOLLARS THERE --

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:12.110
FOR THAT --

02:19:12.177 --> 02:19:13.978
AND THEN IN TERMS OF TO YOUR

02:19:14.045 --> 02:19:15.747
POINTS IN YOUR SKINNER --

02:19:15.814 --> 02:19:16.781
ANOTHER BUT THERE REALLY ANY

02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:18.717
PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE WAS ABI

02:19:18.783 --> 02:19:22.087
VACATED BY MATTHEW DESMOND --

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:23.688
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW.

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:24.889
HE HAS THIS PHRASE PARTICULARLY

02:19:24.956 --> 02:19:26.524
IN IN THE CONSERVE MILWAUKEE BUT

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.259
HE SAYS A MILWAUKEE FOR BLACK

02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:29.394
MEN THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:30.929
LOCKED IN THE FOR BLACK WOMEN'S

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:32.263
BEING LOCKED OUT FOR I GUESS A

02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:33.398
THIRD OF BLACK WITH MILWAUKEE

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:34.032
HAD BEEN INFLICTED.

02:19:34.099 --> 02:19:35.834
AT SOME POINT AND I'M SURE THAT

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.269
TREND SIMILAR THROUGHOUT --

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:40.004
SO THAT THAT THAT'S ANOTHER

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.139
GREAT BUT CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:42.440
OTHER POLICY CHOICES ABOUT

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.608
REQUIRE HUGE ALLOCATIONS OF

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.043
MONEY THINGS LIKE I'M RIGHT TO

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.078
COUNSEL FREE FICTIONS WHICH BAG

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.447
OF 90% OF FOLKS WHO HAVE COUNSEL

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:51.015
WHEN ABOUT THE VICTIM.

02:19:51.082 --> 02:19:52.550
DON'T GET EVICTEDSO I DON'T

02:19:52.617 --> 02:19:54.385
KNOW BECOME HOMELESS OVER A

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:56.221
SECOND STOCKTON WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:57.789
SO WHAT CAN WE DO LOCALLY. TO

02:19:57.856 --> 02:19:59.457
BEGIN POUNDING THAT BUT AND

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:00.458
ANSWER QUESTIONS AND I THINK.

02:20:00.525 --> 02:20:01.826
CANNABIS REVENUE ARE FINDING

02:20:01.893 --> 02:20:04.028
SOME SORT OF REVENUE STREAM MET

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:05.897
UPON STARTS WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT.

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:12.437
THIS IS AN CLUBBING ONCE HE SAID

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:14.806
THE PRIORITY YOU EITHER THANK

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:16.574
YOU APPRECIATE I KNOW THAT TIME

02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:18.076
IS OF THE ESSENCE.

02:20:18.143 --> 02:20:19.144
YOU KNOW --

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.912
MISTER AND SALE YOU AND THE

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.413
MAYOR MADE A COMMENT ABOUT --

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.149
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ONE THAT'S

02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:25.917
FOR HOMELESSNESS.

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:27.752
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING --

02:20:27.819 --> 02:20:28.953
BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:31.055
AGAINST A NUMBER OF THE

02:20:31.122 --> 02:20:33.224
PROPOSALS TO HELP HOMELESS

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.759
PEOPLE --

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:35.693
AND DATE.

02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:41.132
RISE UP IN THEIR VERY VOCAL --

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:43.234
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY A NUMBER

02:20:43.301 --> 02:20:45.403
OF YEARS AGO TO GO TO UTAH --

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:46.805
WHO ARE WAS SENT BY THE SENATE

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.239
LEADER AT THE TIME TO LOOK AT

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:49.607
THEIR MODEL?

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:51.342
CALIFORNIA'S NOT YOU TIME

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:52.844
CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:54.445
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR--

02:20:54.512 --> 02:20:55.446
MISTER AND SO WHEN YOU TALK

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:58.116
ABOUT THE AMAZING UNPRECEDENTED

02:20:58.183 --> 02:21:00.952
COALITION OF GOVERNMENTAL

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:03.054
ENTITIES THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER.

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.322
BETWEEN THE CITY AND COUNTY AND

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:05.523
WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR WAS PRIVATE

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:06.825
SECTOR.

02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:08.359
SPECIFICALLY.

02:21:08.426 --> 02:21:10.228
AND WHAT I SAW ON UTAH WAS

02:21:10.295 --> 02:21:12.897
UNIQUE TO UTAH BUT IT WAS

02:21:12.964 --> 02:21:15.733
PRIVATE SECTOR CHURCH.

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.068
AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:20.905
COOL IT WAS FASCINATING.

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.707
WORD LITERALLY SPEAKING FROM THE

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:24.709
SAME SCRIPT.

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:25.944
SO I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

02:21:26.010 --> 02:21:27.278
ARE AT A UNIQUE POINT IN TIME

02:21:27.345 --> 02:21:29.314
NOW IN CALIFORNIA WHERE MULTIPLE

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:30.348
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT WE WE

02:21:30.415 --> 02:21:32.083
FIGURED OUT IT IS A CRISIS WE

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:33.384
ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART.

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.620
THE STATE HAS BEEN NEGLIGENT WE

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:37.689
HAVE STEPPED UP IN RECENT YEARS

02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.090
TO DO OUR PART.

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:42.527
WHO ARE WE MISSING IN THE PUZZLE

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:44.362
PIECE IN TERMS OF REALLY COMING

02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:45.997
OUT WITH A CAKE THAT WITH THE?

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:48.800
RIGHT EQUATION TO TRY TO MAKE

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:50.768
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHO WHO

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:51.069
[inaudible]

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:53.271
WHO'S MISSING.

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:55.039
WHAT IF IF THAT QUESTION IS IS

02:21:55.106 --> 02:21:56.774
FOR ME MADAM CHAIR AT LET ME LET

02:21:56.841 --> 02:21:59.310

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:01.980
THAT THE EFFORT IN LOS ANGELES

02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:03.982

02:22:04.048 --> 02:22:05.183
GOVERNMENT.

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:06.518
THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION AND

02:22:06.584 --> 02:22:07.952
THAT IS BY NO MEANS THE CASE

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.320
RIGHT -- I

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:11.089
THINK I SHARED THAT WHEN WE

02:24:06.471 --> 02:24:09.941
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS

02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.943
LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:12.510
IF I COULD JUST IS FOR TO

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:15.113
COMMENT BRIEFLY ON THE POINT

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:17.181
I'M NOT EVERYONE'S IN AGREEMENT

02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:19.650
ON ALL OF THE SOLUTIONS --

02:24:19.717 --> 02:24:22.153
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I'M NO

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:23.621
WHEN USING DIFFERENT

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:25.656
HOMELESSNESS.

02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:27.525
I KNOW WHEN IS FOR IT.

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:28.860
AND THAT IS INDEED A COMMON

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:30.928
GROUND NOW THAT SAID REASONABLE

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:31.963
PEOPLE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:34.999
PERSPECTIVES ON SOLUTIONS.

02:24:35.066 --> 02:24:37.201
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT NOT

02:24:37.268 --> 02:24:38.469
TO DEMONIZED.

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.271
PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:43.941
PARTICULAR SOLUTIONS --

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:46.344
AND AS WELL AS NOT TO DEMONIZED

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:48.746
PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY LEGITIMATE

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:50.314
CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT.

02:24:50.381 --> 02:24:52.016
REALITY IF I STILL THAT YOUNG

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:53.251
CHILDREN AT HOME.

02:24:53.317 --> 02:24:54.285
AND THERE IS A PERSON

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:56.454
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:59.223
CAR IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE --

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:00.858
AND PERHAPS RELIEVING HIM OR

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.660
HERSELF.

02:25:02.727 --> 02:25:04.729
IN MY FRIEND YARD I WOULD BE

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:06.364
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT --

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:07.799
NOW WAS THERE ANY MY PASSIONATE

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:08.599
COMMITMENT TO COMBATING

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:11.335
HOMELESSNESS SO I THINK THAT

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:12.770
WHAT THE COMMON GROUND.

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:16.240
AS HUMAN BEINGS AND WHAT WE FEEL

02:25:16.307 --> 02:25:16.908
IS THE MAYOR MENTION THIS SURVEY

02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:20.044
OF NEURAL RESPONSE AND WE SEE A

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:21.212
FELLOW MEMBER OF OUR SPECIES

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:23.047
SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK.

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.882
I THINK THE COMING GROUND USE

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:27.251
THAT BASIS FOR DEEP ALIGNMENT

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:29.053
AND GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.354
FORWARD --

02:25:30.421 --> 02:25:33.724
AND TO ENGAGE IN SORT OF

02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:35.893
MEANINGFUL DISCOURSE I'M AROUND

02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:37.195
A RANGE OF SOLUTIONS I WOULD

02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:39.230
ALSO SAY FINALLY ON THE QUESTION

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.631
OF CITING --

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:42.433
GETTING INURNMENT PERMITS

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:43.734
APARTMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:25:43.801 --> 02:25:46.204
CITED DOESN'T REQUIRE WINNING AN

02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:48.706
ELECTION AND IT ALSO DOESN'T

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:50.708
REQUIRE A 100% --

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:53.111
AS THE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT A

02:25:53.177 --> 02:25:54.612
PARTICULAR PROJECT.

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:56.881
UNITED WAY DID A POLL THAT

02:25:56.948 --> 02:25:58.950
SHOWED THAT 70% OF LOS ANGELES

02:25:59.016 --> 02:26:01.452
COUNTY RESIDENTS 70%.

02:26:01.519 --> 02:26:02.920
SUPPORT DECIDING OF PERMANENT

02:26:02.987 --> 02:26:04.122
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THEIR

02:26:04.188 --> 02:26:06.124
NEIGHBORHOOD NOT IN THERE ZIP

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:06.958
CODE.

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:08.960
DIED IN THEIR CITY IN THEIR

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:13.464
NEIGHBORHOOD. TO THE KEY AROUND

02:26:13.531 --> 02:26:17.969
CITING SO THAT THE VOICES OF THE

02:26:18.035 --> 02:26:21.072
30% DON'T DROWN THEM OUT

02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:21.372
[inaudible]

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:26.878
APPRECIATE THAT. TWENTY COMMENTS --

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.079
I ADMIRE MR AND CELLS

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:30.114
APPRECIATION FOR THE HUMAN

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:31.415
SPECIES --

02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:33.050
AYE AYE AYE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

02:26:33.117 --> 02:26:34.952
MORE JUDGMENTAL --

02:26:35.019 --> 02:26:36.420
HAVING HAVING WORKED IN LOTS OF

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:38.089
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE BROUGHT

02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:39.624
FORWARD PROPOSALS WHERE.

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:40.858
I THINK PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO HOLD

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:42.426
COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY IDEAS

02:26:42.493 --> 02:26:43.861
IN THEIR HEAD AT THE SAME TIME

02:26:43.928 --> 02:26:46.230
AROUND THIS TOPIC AND SO --

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:48.099
I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS.

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:49.834
I THINK MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:26:49.901 --> 02:26:50.935
WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DO NOT

02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:52.803
WANT THE POWER TO ZONE OR THE

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:54.105
POWER TO APPROVE PROJECTS TAKEN

02:26:54.172 --> 02:26:55.273
AWAY FROM THEM.

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:56.774
BUT I'VE NOTICED I PARTICIPATED

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:58.409
IN THE CASA PROCESS THAT I THINK

02:26:58.476 --> 02:26:59.777
SOME OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH.

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:03.181
IS THAT THE THE ELECTORATES

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:05.383
DESIRE TO PUNISH LAWMAKERS THAT

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:07.118
MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES AROUND THIS

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:09.020
IS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL.

02:27:09.086 --> 02:27:10.321
AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT WOULD BE

02:27:10.388 --> 02:27:11.656
A GREAT SERVICE TO LOCAL ELECTED

02:27:11.722 --> 02:27:12.490
OFFICIALS TO TAKE SOME OF THIS

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.192
POWER AWAY.

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:15.359
AND I THINK THE REASON WHY I

02:27:15.426 --> 02:27:16.827
BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE OF 70%

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:18.596
OF THE ELECTORATE REALLY DOES

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:19.197
SUPPORT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:27:19.263 --> 02:27:20.031
HOUSING.

02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:22.366
THE OTHER 30% IS ABUSING THE

02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:24.402
PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE.

02:27:24.468 --> 02:27:25.970
AND ERY VOCAL IN AN IN

02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:27.939
ELECTIONS. TO MAKE IT VERY VERY

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:29.240
PAINFUL FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE

02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:30.875
RIGHT CHOICES AND SO I THINK.

02:27:30.942 --> 02:27:32.176
I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER SENATOR

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:33.544
THAT WE'VE GOT SOME PROPOSALS

02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:34.078
THAT NOT EVERYONE IS IN

02:27:34.145 --> 02:27:35.213
AGREEMENT WITH.

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.347
BUT I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE BIT

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.416
PAST THE POINT OF CAN WE ALL GET

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.351
THEIR COOPERATIVELY --

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:42.420
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE LOST

02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:45.723
ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:47.491
DOLLARS ON A PROPOSAL TO BUY A

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:49.427
MOTEL THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED

02:27:49.493 --> 02:27:50.795
FOR PURCHASE BY A LOCAL POLICE

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:51.629
DEPARTMENT.

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:53.898
BECAUSE IT WAS --

02:27:53.965 --> 02:27:54.465
LET'S JUST SAY IT AT OUR THE

02:27:54.532 --> 02:27:55.700
CUSTOMERS --

02:27:55.766 --> 02:27:57.401
AND WE WENT AHEAD AN OPTION THE

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:59.270
PROPERTY AND FACED AN

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:01.939
UNBELIEVABLE BACKLASH --

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:03.441
FROM FOLKS THAT DID NOT WANT TO

02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:04.809
DO IT WAS GOING TO BE HALF OF

02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:06.644
FORMALLY HOMELESS VETERANS AND

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:07.578
HALF -- FOR

02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:08.212
I THINK FORMALLY HOMES SENIORS

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:11.482
LIKE IF I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT

02:28:11.549 --> 02:28:12.817
THAT SECOND PIECE --

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:13.918
WHAT WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS REALLY

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.453
IMPORTANT ABOUT WHAT --

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.054
MISTRANSLATED EARLIER ABOUT

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.356
WHAT'S HAPPENING LOS ANGELES NOW

02:28:18.422 --> 02:28:19.757
IS IF YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE YOU

02:28:19.824 --> 02:28:22.293
CAN SEE BY EACH COUNCIL DISTRICT.

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.794
WHICH OF THEM IS ACTUALLY

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:25.730
MEETING THE GOALS IN TERMS OF

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:27.064
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:28.532
THEIR DISTRICT AND SO WHEN WE

02:28:28.599 --> 02:28:30.001
HAVE GONE OUT TO DISTRICTS THAT.

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:30.935
HAVE BEEN DONE A LOT OF THIS

02:28:31.002 --> 02:28:32.870
WORK WE ARE GETTING A RECEPTION

02:28:32.937 --> 02:28:34.739
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:28:34.805 --> 02:28:35.306
ONE WE GOT EVEN TWENTY FOUR

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.041
MONTHS AGO --

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:38.442
IT MAY NOT ENABLE A LOCAL

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:39.644
ELECTED OFFICIAL STAND UP TO A

02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:41.345
TOTALLY CRAZY SITUATION BUT I

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:42.380
THINK IT.

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:44.215
IS VERY IMPORTANT SO I THINK.

02:28:44.282 --> 02:28:46.384
YOU KNOW TO SENATOR BELLS

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:48.052
QUESTION ABOUT CUPERTINO.

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:49.086
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:28:49.153 --> 02:28:50.421
MAYBE IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IS

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:52.056
THAT ONE OF THE REALLY POWERFUL

02:28:52.123 --> 02:28:53.090
THINGS ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT LAW.

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:55.326
WAS IT ACTUALLYGAVE MONEY TO

02:28:55.393 --> 02:28:55.926
PURCHASE PROPERTY AT THE LOCAL

02:28:55.993 --> 02:28:57.194
LEVEL.

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:57.795
NOW A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT

02:28:57.862 --> 02:28:59.397
WE'RE SPENDING AT THE STATE

02:28:59.463 --> 02:29:00.298
LEVEL IS ACTUALLY COMING IN THE

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:01.666
FORM OF GAP FUNNY THAT COMES

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:02.733
AFTER YOU MADE THE PURCHASE

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:03.768
RIGHT.

02:29:03.834 --> 02:29:05.269
AND SO I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:06.537
THE CUPERTINO IS OF THE WORLD

02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:07.605
AND YOU SORT OF CONSTRUED TRUST

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:09.040
IT WOULD STOCKTON I THINK.

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:10.975
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO GIVE MAYOR

02:29:11.042 --> 02:29:13.010
TUBS OF MONEY --

02:29:13.077 --> 02:29:14.145
TO TO ARE UNFORTUNATELY A BUNCH

02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:15.613
OF VERY JOBS RICH COMMUNITIES

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:16.981
OUR STATE WHERE IF YOU GIVEN THE

02:29:17.048 --> 02:29:17.515
MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO DO

02:29:17.581 --> 02:29:18.516
ANYTHING WITH IT.

02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:19.817
AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION FOR

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:21.552
YOU IS LEGISLATORS IS AT WHAT

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:24.755
POINT DO PEOPLE LOSE THE RIGHT.

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.924
TO PROCEED AT THEIR OWN PACE AT

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:28.893
FOR ME WAS ABOUT A DECADE AGO --

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.661
I SENSE THAT NOW IS THE MOMENT

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:31.762
FOR MANY OTHERS.

02:29:31.829 --> 02:29:34.098
AND AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY

02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:36.100
I THINK I THINK THAT I I

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:36.767
RECENTLY HEARD AN ELECTED

02:29:36.834 --> 02:29:37.835
OFFICIAL TALK ABOUT IS I CAN'T

02:29:37.902 --> 02:29:39.503
REMEMBER WHO IT IS BUT JUST LIKE

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:41.172
WE DO ON EVERY OTHER TOPIC WE

02:29:41.238 --> 02:29:42.173
HAVE.

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:45.509
A STANDARD OF CIVIC BEHAVIOR

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:46.077
THAT WE EXPECT OUT OF LOCAL

02:29:46.143 --> 02:29:47.778
GOVERNMENT AND AND FRANKLY IF

02:29:47.845 --> 02:29:49.180
PART OF IT IS ADDRESSING

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:50.448
HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE

02:29:50.514 --> 02:29:51.716
HOUSING AND HOUSING SHORTAGE

02:29:51.782 --> 02:29:52.817
THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE.

02:29:52.883 --> 02:29:53.551
THAN THERE OUGHT TO BE A SERIES

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:54.985
OF BEHAVIORS THAT WE EXPECT A

02:29:55.052 --> 02:29:58.255
LOW COLLECTED OFFICIALS WERE

02:29:58.322 --> 02:29:58.889
APPOINTED OFFICIALS OR WHATEVER

02:29:58.956 --> 02:30:00.991
IT IS. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:01.592
THOSE THINGS AND IF THEY CAN'T

02:30:01.659 --> 02:30:02.526
OR WON'T --

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:03.928
I I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.496
STATE TO ACT AND REMOVE SOME OF

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:06.897
THOSE SOME OF THOSE OF THIRTIES

02:30:06.964 --> 02:30:08.366
AND I AND HONESTLY I THINK.

02:30:08.432 --> 02:30:09.667
IT WILL BE TO THE BENEFIT OF

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.702
MANY LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO

02:30:11.769 --> 02:30:13.237
ARE OTHERWISE PUTTING COMPLETELY

02:30:13.304 --> 02:30:15.039

I WAS COMPELLED BY YOU'RE

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:42.500
TALKING ABOUT RAPID RE HOUSING.

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.068
THERE WERE MANY IMPEDIMENTS TO

02:30:44.135 --> 02:30:46.370
THAT.

02:30:46.437 --> 02:30:47.905
IS THERE ANY HOPE AT THE LOCAL

02:30:47.972 --> 02:30:49.173
LEVEL.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:51.208
FOR FASTRACK PERMITTING OR

02:30:51.275 --> 02:30:53.077
CONSOLIDATED PERMITTING THE THAT

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:55.479
WOULD BE AN ELEMENT OF HELPING

02:30:55.546 --> 02:30:56.080
WITH YOUR FAST TRACKING WOULD

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:59.183
NOT.

02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:00.918
SO I AM CENTER THANK YOU FOR

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:04.755
YOUR QUESTION THAT.

02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:06.524
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CHAIR BIG

02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:08.259
KNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:10.027
WITH THE PARTIAL EXCEPTION OF

02:31:10.094 --> 02:31:12.663
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

02:31:12.730 --> 02:31:14.965
THE VAST MAJORITY OF FAMILIES

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:16.167
AND ADULTS EXPERIENCING

02:31:16.233 --> 02:31:17.334
HOMELESSNESS.

02:31:17.401 --> 02:31:19.737
WILL ESCAPE HOMELESSNESS NOT BY

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:21.305
MOVING INTO NEWLY BUILT HOUSING.

02:31:21.372 --> 02:31:22.573
THEY WILL MOVE INTO ALREADY

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.974
EXISTING HOUSING.

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:25.810
AND THEY WILL NEED A RENTAL

02:31:25.876 --> 02:31:29.480
SUBSIDY TO DO IT NOW THAT SAID.

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.949
THE ABBOTT THEY SHOULD THE DEEP

02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:33.451
SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:35.786
IN THE STATE FIVE HUNDRED AND

02:31:35.853 --> 02:31:37.354
SIXTY THOUSAND UNIT SHORTFALL IN

02:31:37.421 --> 02:31:38.923
LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE.

02:31:38.989 --> 02:31:40.357
IS THE GROUND OF OUR HOMELESS

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:41.859
CRISIS THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:43.227
RENTS TO GO UP.

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:45.129
AND RATES GOING UP IS WHAT'S

02:31:45.196 --> 02:31:48.432
CAUSING PEOPLE TO BECOME.

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:52.303
I IN NO WAY WANT TO MINIMIZE THE

02:31:52.369 --> 02:31:54.004
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF

02:31:54.071 --> 02:31:57.141
INCREASING HOUSING SUPPLY.

02:31:57.208 --> 02:31:59.243
AND POTENTIALLY TAKING OTHER

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:02.813
POLICY ACTIONS TO MITIGATE RENT

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:03.080
INCREASES.

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.582
BY.

02:32:04.648 --> 02:32:06.951
THAT SAID THERE IS NOT THE

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:10.287
LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:11.989
A FAMILY OR DAHLE HE'S HOMELESS

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.424
TODAY.

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:15.459
AND MOVING INTO A NEWLY BUILT

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:17.962
UNIT TOMORROW IT'S MORE OF THESE

02:32:18.028 --> 02:32:19.930
INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:21.765
OF THE MARKET DYNAMIC OF SUPPLY

02:32:21.832 --> 02:32:23.601
AND DEMAND AND ITS IMPACT ON

02:32:23.667 --> 02:32:24.268
RENTS.

02:32:24.335 --> 02:32:26.670
SO THAT SAID --

02:32:26.737 --> 02:32:29.039
THE KEY TO MOVING FAMILIES AND

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:32.076
ADULTS IN TWO IN A RAPID RE

02:32:32.142 --> 02:32:34.044
HOUSING PROGRAM IS LOCATING THE

02:32:34.111 --> 02:32:35.679
AVAILABLE UNITS --

02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:37.248
AND THE FACT THAT THE HOUSING

02:32:37.314 --> 02:32:39.116
MARKET IS SO TIGHT IS THE

02:32:39.183 --> 02:32:40.818
BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO THAT NOW

02:32:40.885 --> 02:32:42.486
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:43.754
EXAMPLE THROUGH INCREASING

02:32:43.821 --> 02:32:45.189
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS.

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:48.025
IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY. TO

02:32:48.092 --> 02:32:49.560
INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:51.562
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S AN

02:32:51.629 --> 02:32:53.297
AREA WHERE WE ARE FOCUSING --

02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:55.232
QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY ON YOUR VERY

02:32:55.299 --> 02:32:56.567
SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:59.336
PERMITTING THAT IS PRIMARILY A

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:01.739
CITY RESPONSIBILITY I'M IN LOS

02:33:01.805 --> 02:33:03.541
ANGELES COUNTY 90%.

02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:06.043
OF OUR COUNTY RESIDENTS LIVE IN

02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:07.211
ONE OF OUR EIGHTY EIGHT

02:33:07.278 --> 02:33:08.812
INCORPORATED CITIES EIGHTIES

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:10.714
EACH OF THOSE EIGHTY EIGHT

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:12.917
CITIES TO THEIR CITY COUNCILS.

02:33:12.983 --> 02:33:14.985
AND SEE MANAGERS AND DAD

02:33:15.052 --> 02:33:16.720
PLANNING COMMISSIONS THAT MAKE

02:33:16.787 --> 02:33:20.591
THE DECISIONS --

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:23.627
AROUND PER MEETING AT YOUR

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:26.263
PROJECTS EITHER BY RIGHT OR ON A

02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:28.432
DISCRETIONARY BASIS. ONE OF THE

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:29.233
INTERESTING.

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:31.302
OBSERVATIONS THAT I'VE HAD OVER

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:33.170
MANY DECADES AND MISTER

02:33:33.237 --> 02:33:34.371
SHOEMAKER SOMEWHAT [inaudible]

02:33:34.438 --> 02:33:36.674
NOTED THAT.

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:38.342
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LONG

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:40.177
COMPLAINED.

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:42.813
ABOUT STATE MANDATES.

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:45.349
PARTICULAR UNFUNDED MANDATES.

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:46.550
BUT I FOUND OUT MANY YEARS AGO

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.319
THAT SOME OF THE LOCAL

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:49.787
JURISDICTIONS.

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:52.690
SILENTLY REALLY LIKED THOSE.

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.291
MANDATES.

02:33:54.358 --> 02:33:56.660
BECAUSE IT GOT THEM OFF THE HOOK.

02:33:56.727 --> 02:33:58.529
WELL I GET THAT.

02:33:58.596 --> 02:34:00.564
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT

02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:01.932
HAD WE WALK A MIDDLE GROUND NOW.

02:34:01.999 --> 02:34:03.634
TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE

02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:04.101
PRESSURES ON THE LOCAL

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:05.703
GOVERNMENTS.

02:34:05.769 --> 02:34:08.472
BUT ALSO THEN TO ENCOURAGE

02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:10.474
DECISION MAKING.

02:34:10.541 --> 02:34:11.809
AND GETTING THE JOB DONE IT'S

02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:13.510
JUST A IT'S BEEN A PARADOX

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:17.381
THAT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME.

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:19.817
THEN WILL THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF

02:34:19.883 --> 02:34:20.517
THIS FILM WITH THAT BURDEN

02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:21.852
WEALTH IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS FOR

02:34:21.919 --> 02:34:22.820
OVER A LONG TIME BUT I DON'T

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:24.154
KNOW IF THAT'S THE ANSWER IN THE

02:34:24.221 --> 02:34:27.891
FUTURE FOR THE STATE TO SUE MORE.

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:30.394
RESPONSIBILITYOF LAW FOR THEM

02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:33.497
TO TO COMMENT ON THAT.

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:35.032
YEAH YEAH.

02:34:35.099 --> 02:34:36.600
I I KIND OF MOVED OFF ON TO THAT

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:38.335
YET NO I APPRECIATE THE THE THE

02:34:38.402 --> 02:34:40.104
COMMON SENATOR I I GUESS I WOULD

02:34:40.170 --> 02:34:41.472
SAY -- IN

02:34:41.538 --> 02:34:42.039
SOME WAYS I DON'T KNOW THE

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:42.773
YOU'RE TAKING ON MORE THAN

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.241
MANDATE AS MUCH AS JUST --

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:45.676
TECHNOLOGY THAT THERE ARE

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:46.877
ASPECTS OF OUR DEMOCRATIC

02:34:46.944 --> 02:34:48.612
PROCESS TO DON'T WORK VERY WELL.

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:50.381
AND SO TO HAVE DIRECT DEMOCRACY

02:34:50.447 --> 02:34:51.749
OR SOMETHING APPROACHING IT.

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:53.717
BE THE RULE OF THE DAY FOR THE

02:34:53.784 --> 02:34:55.352
APPROVAL OF INDIVIDUAL HOUSING

02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:56.720
DEVELOPMENT SEEMS LIKE A BAD.

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:57.855
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OUR

02:34:57.921 --> 02:34:59.123
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND WE'VE

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:01.025
GOT REPRESENTED DEMOCRACY FOR A

02:35:01.091 --> 02:35:01.825
REASON.

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:02.559
BUT WHEN IT COMES A LAND USE

02:35:02.626 --> 02:35:03.761
DECISIONS IT'S IF WE DO A

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:05.696
PLEBISCITE ON EVERY PROJECTAND

02:35:05.763 --> 02:35:07.197
AND SO I WOULD SAY IT'S ACTUALLY

02:35:07.264 --> 02:35:09.433
MORE.

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:10.601
AT A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE

02:35:10.668 --> 02:35:12.302
LEGISLATURE CAN SEE THAT.

02:35:12.369 --> 02:35:14.004
OUR SYSTEM FOR MAKING DECISIONS

02:35:14.071 --> 02:35:15.239
WHEN WE HAVE AN OVERWHELMING

02:35:15.305 --> 02:35:16.707
NEED TO MAKE THEM.

02:35:16.774 --> 02:35:18.142
IS NOT OCCURRING WITH THE TOOLS

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:19.576
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US OF

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:20.210
THE PROCESS EITHER WE HAVE SET

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.145
UP AND SO.

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:22.413
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE TAKING ON

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.581
AS MUCH AS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:25.649
WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE

02:35:25.716 --> 02:35:27.584
BIT TOO FAR IN TERMS OF PROCESS

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.987
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

02:35:30.054 --> 02:35:32.489
AT THIS WRESTLING OTHER POINT IN

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:35.259
A WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING TO

02:35:35.325 --> 02:35:36.460
LOCATE.

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:37.361
AN SHELTER FOR HOMELESS

02:35:37.428 --> 02:35:37.661
[inaudible]

02:35:37.728 --> 02:35:40.831
PERSON.

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:42.700
WHAT ARE YOUR OPTIONS ARE THE?

02:35:42.766 --> 02:35:45.135
CONSIDERABLE FOR HAVING THOSE

02:35:45.202 --> 02:35:48.138
LOCATIONS BE WITH NEXUS.

02:35:48.205 --> 02:35:50.974
TO TREATMENT MEDICAL CARE.

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.476
EDUCATION.

02:35:52.543 --> 02:35:53.143
ALL THOSE.

02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:54.511
THAT TO THEM PORTENT PART OF

02:35:54.578 --> 02:35:58.449
GETTING SOMEONE PERMANENTLY OFF.

02:35:58.515 --> 02:36:00.651
THE THE SO CALLED TREADMILL OF

02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:02.419
HOMELESSNESS.

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:03.921
CHOOSE SENATOR --

02:36:03.987 --> 02:36:05.556
PRIOR TO YOU ARE THE ONES WHO

02:36:05.622 --> 02:36:08.192
ARE HOMELESS INITIATIVE IN.

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:08.859
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MOST

02:36:08.926 --> 02:36:10.327
PUBLICLY FUNDED --

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:11.795

02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:15.399
HOURS A DAY.

02:36:15.466 --> 02:36:16.734
SO THE RESIDENTS HAD TO LIGHT AT

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:19.903
BEACH DAY NIGHT.

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.772
WE CHANGE THAT SAY NOW ALL

TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY.

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:27.778
AND THEREFORE FUNCTIONS AS A

02:36:27.845 --> 02:36:30.748
PLATFORM FOR ACCESS TO SERVICES

02:36:30.814 --> 02:36:31.949
AND PERMANENT HOUSING

02:36:32.015 --> 02:36:32.249
[inaudible]

02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:37.454
THE AS LONG AS IN ROOM HOUSING

02:36:37.521 --> 02:36:39.857
IS ACCESSIBLE VIA PUBLIC

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:41.692
TRANSPORTATION.

02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:44.194
I WOULD SAY GENERALLY THAT IT

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:45.362
WOULD BE --

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:46.897
AFIQ COULD BE A FEASIBLE

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:48.866
LOCATION IN TERMS OF MEETING THE

02:36:48.932 --> 02:36:50.434
SERVICE NEEDS THE OTHER THING I

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:51.902
WOULD SAY THERE.

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:53.604
IS THAT.

02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:55.139
HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE LIKE

02:36:55.205 --> 02:36:56.607
EVERYBODY ELSE.

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.542
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN

02:36:58.609 --> 02:37:00.544
THEIR LIVES IS RELATIONSHIPS

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.179
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:04.148

GENERALLY.

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.121

IT OUT ALL THE THE THE SMALLER

02:40:29.152 --> 02:40:29.586
PIECES OF LAND IN THEIR

02:40:29.653 --> 02:40:30.587
JURISDICTION.

AND HAVE --

02:40:31.488 --> 02:40:33.223

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:34.524
SUCCESS STARTED I'LL JUST SAY

02:40:34.591 --> 02:40:36.460

02:40:39.196 --> 02:40:40.731
THE MONEY TO GO.

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:42.566
WAS YOU KNOW.

02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:44.601
THE QUESTION A MONTHS NOT YEARS --

02:40:44.668 --> 02:40:46.536
AND WE HAVE NOW WE'RE NOW

02:40:46.603 --> 02:40:48.305
BUILDING OUR SECOND --

02:40:48.372 --> 02:40:49.172
DEVELOPMENT THERE --

02:40:49.239 --> 02:40:50.340
FOR FORMALLY HOMES THAT --

02:40:50.407 --> 02:40:52.009
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT

02:40:52.075 --> 02:40:53.210
A GOVERNMENT'S THEIR LOCAL

02:40:53.276 --> 02:40:54.044
GOVERNMENTS ARE MOVING FORWARD

02:40:54.111 --> 02:40:55.479
ON SURPLUS PROPERTY WHEN YOU

02:40:55.545 --> 02:40:57.647
WANT TO DO WHAT YOU CAN DO IT --

02:40:57.714 --> 02:40:59.282
AND THEN OCCASIONALLY WE DO WE

02:40:59.349 --> 02:41:02.119
DO PURCHASE PROPERTY WE'D WE DO --

02:41:02.185 --> 02:41:02.652
ESPECIALLY AROUND BERMAN

02:41:02.719 --> 02:41:03.920
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:05.122
ACQUIRE HOTELS AND MOTELS OFTEN

02:41:05.188 --> 02:41:08.258
BECAUSE FASTER WAY TO GET TO THE

02:41:08.325 --> 02:41:10.427
FINISH LINE ON ON THOSE TYPES OF

02:41:10.494 --> 02:41:11.695
ISSUES --

02:41:11.762 --> 02:41:12.763
IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PERFECT

02:41:12.829 --> 02:41:14.097
PLACE FOR SOMETHING BUT IT'S

02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:15.932
IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE THE ONE OF

02:41:15.999 --> 02:41:18.335
THE WAYS WE DO IT --

02:41:18.402 --> 02:41:19.202
AND YOU KNOW AND OCCASIONALLY GO

02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:20.904
OUT AND IF WE'RE REALLY ANXIOUS

02:41:20.971 --> 02:41:21.805
TO GET SOMETHING IN A PARTICULAR

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:22.973
COMMUNITY WILL GO AHEAD AND AND

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.341
WORK WITH A BROKER IN TRYING TO

02:41:24.408 --> 02:41:25.809
FIND A WAY TO PURGE THE LAND.

02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:27.210
ON IN YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT

02:41:27.277 --> 02:41:28.779
DEVELOPERS WORK DIFFERENTLY IN

02:41:28.845 --> 02:41:29.312
THAT REGARD I THINK WE'RE

02:41:29.379 --> 02:41:30.180
PROBABLY MORE ON THE

02:41:30.247 --> 02:41:31.782
RELATIONSHIP SIDE A LITTLE BIT

02:41:31.848 --> 02:41:32.849
LESS ON THE REAL ESTATE BROKERS

02:41:32.916 --> 02:41:34.651
AND SOME OTHERS --

02:41:34.718 --> 02:41:36.119
IN TERMS OF PENCILING IT OUT I I

02:41:36.186 --> 02:41:37.154
THINK THIS IS --

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:38.255
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW WHICH

02:41:38.321 --> 02:41:39.623
IS I THINK AT THIS POINT IN A

02:41:39.689 --> 02:41:41.091
MAYBE FOR THIS BEFORE MOST

02:41:41.158 --> 02:41:41.992
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS OF

02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:43.760
THE STATE HAVE TO GO TO SEVEN OR

02:41:43.827 --> 02:41:44.327
EIGHT DIFFERENT SOURCES OF

02:41:44.394 --> 02:41:45.762
FUNDING FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT.

02:41:45.829 --> 02:41:47.197
AND EACH ONE HAS SOMETHING

02:41:47.264 --> 02:41:48.498
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

02:41:48.565 --> 02:41:50.167
YOUR YOUR MANDATE IS THAT MY

02:41:50.233 --> 02:41:51.334
BUILDING BE BLUE.

02:41:51.401 --> 02:41:52.903
AND YEARS IS THAT IT ALSO BE

02:41:52.969 --> 02:41:54.471
BANK AND SO I'VE GOT TO FIND

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:55.672
SOMETHING THAT'S BLUE AND PINK

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:57.407
IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE.

02:41:57.474 --> 02:41:58.975
AND I THINK THAT --

02:41:59.042 --> 02:42:00.410
THE FEWER SOURCES OF FUNDING WE

02:42:00.477 --> 02:42:03.013
USE FOR EACH PROJECT THE BETTER

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:03.580
OFF WE BE CITING ONE OF THE

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:06.383
THINGS THAT.

02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:09.820
IS A LITTLE BIT OF A I DON'T USE

02:42:09.886 --> 02:42:10.420
MY WORDS HERE CAREFULLY BUT A

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:11.521
LITTLE BIT DISCONCERTING ABOUT

02:42:11.588 --> 02:42:13.623
THE WAY WE TEND OF FUND MONEY OR

02:42:13.690 --> 02:42:14.424
FUND.

02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:15.559
DEVELOPMENT AS WE WE SORT OF TRY

02:42:15.625 --> 02:42:16.326
AND PILE THE SMALLEST AMOUNT

02:42:16.393 --> 02:42:18.028
POSSIBLE FROM ONE SOURCE TO

02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:19.262
LEVERAGE ANOTHER IN THE LEVERAGE

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:20.464
ANOTHER WHEN IN FACT I THINK.

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:21.698
WOULD BE IN THE STATE'S INTEREST

02:42:21.765 --> 02:42:22.732
TO SORT OF SAY LET'S MAKE THE

02:42:22.799 --> 02:42:23.834
FUNDING AWARDS FOR EACH OF THESE

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.001
DEVELOPMENTS.

02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:26.937
TWICE AS BIG ARE THREE TIMES AS

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:27.971
BIG SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO

02:42:28.038 --> 02:42:28.939
THE STATE FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:42:29.005 --> 02:42:29.906
TYPES OF FUNDS.

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:31.741
AND THEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:35.512
REGIONAL GROUP FOR THAT AS I BOB

02:42:35.579 --> 02:42:36.680
BY LAND I GET LAND FROM A LOCAL

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:38.181
GOVERNMENT.

02:42:38.248 --> 02:42:39.516
I GET SOME MONEY FROM THE LOCAL

02:42:39.583 --> 02:42:40.884
GOVERNMENT AS WELL TO KIND OF DO

02:42:40.951 --> 02:42:42.352
THE DESIGN SEARCHES AND I GOT A

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.254
ONE SOURCE AT THE STATE LEVEL.

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:45.789
TO MAKE IT WOK --

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:47.057
OFTENTIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE

02:42:47.124 --> 02:42:48.158
AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A

02:42:48.225 --> 02:42:49.593
HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I THINK.

02:42:49.659 --> 02:42:50.393
AS A LEGISLATURE THINGS ABOUT

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:51.862
THE USE OF ITS MONEY IT'S SORT

02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:53.430
OF TEMPTING TO SORT OF SAY LET'S.

02:42:53.497 --> 02:42:54.264
LET'S SPREAD THIS EVERYWHERE

ALTERNATIVE METHODS BUT I JUST

02:47:45.388 --> 02:47:46.823
WANTED TO INTERJECT THAT.

02:47:46.890 --> 02:47:48.658
I INTO THE CONVERSATION AND THEN

02:47:48.725 --> 02:47:50.794
FINALLY JUST TO TIED DOWN TO A

02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:52.362
CENTER MORE LAX --

02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:54.731
QUESTION.

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:57.000
RELATIVE TO CITIES WHICH AGAIN

02:47:57.066 --> 02:47:58.935
MAKE THE LAND USE DECISIONS IN

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:00.904
IN THE IN OUR STATE ARE

02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.472
CURRENTLY --

02:48:02.539 --> 02:48:06.543
ENABLING CITIES TO MOVE TOGETHER.

02:48:06.609 --> 02:48:08.511
RATHER THAN SEPARATELY IS IN OUR

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:10.013
VIEW AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

02:48:10.079 --> 02:48:11.514
SOLUTION AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY

02:48:11.581 --> 02:48:14.083
INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENGAGING THE

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.218
EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES.

02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:16.786
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

02:48:16.853 --> 02:48:17.687
IN.

02:48:17.754 --> 02:48:19.522
TRYING TO MOVE.

02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:22.325
TOGETHER MEANING TO GO ON THE

02:48:22.392 --> 02:48:23.760
SAME TIME LINE THAT YOU DO

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:25.995
SIMILAR THINGS SAY WHEN WE

02:48:26.062 --> 02:48:28.398
ENGAGE FORTY ONE CITIES TO

02:48:28.465 --> 02:48:29.666
WANTED TO DEVELOP CITY SPECIFIC

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.668
HONEST AS PLANS HE WAS ON THE

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:32.902
SAME TIME LINE.

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:34.704
AND THEN WE ALLOCATED NINE

02:48:34.771 --> 02:48:36.439
MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT

02:48:36.506 --> 02:48:37.841
CITIES ARE COMPETITIVE PROCESS

02:48:37.907 --> 02:48:40.210
IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS.

02:48:40.276 --> 02:48:41.177
SO.

02:48:41.244 --> 02:48:42.912
THE INTENTION OF DOING THAT IS

02:48:42.979 --> 02:48:45.882
THAT CITIES ARE AFRAID OF BEING

02:48:45.949 --> 02:48:46.916
MAGNETS.

02:48:46.983 --> 02:48:48.852
I'VE DRAIN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

02:48:48.918 --> 02:48:50.920
HOMELESSNESS FROM SURROUNDING

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:52.489
COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES.

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:57.193
IF CITIES MOVE IN PARALLEL NOT

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.395
THE SAME IF THEY'RE MOVING TO

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:00.230
GATHER IN A CONSTRUCTIVE

02:49:00.296 --> 02:49:03.199
DIRECTION THEN THEY CAN OVERCOME%

02:49:03.266 --> 02:49:04.601
THAT FEAR.
