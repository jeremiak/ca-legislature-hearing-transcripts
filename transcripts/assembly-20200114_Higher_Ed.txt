MISTER BERMAN IF YOU ARE READY YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU -- CHAIR MEDINA AND I THE START OFF BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF IN IN LETTING ME PRESENT THIS BILL AND SPECIAL -- HEARING THIS AFTERNOON -- I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE AB SEVENTY A BILL WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR IN CONTENTS TO LEGISLATION THAT I INTRODUCED LAST YEAR WHICH WAS HEARD -- AND APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE AB SEVENTY WOULD PREVENT COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES FROM INVADING STATE OVERSIGHT SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO VERIFY WHETHER AN INSTITUTION THAT CLAIMS TO BE A NONPROFIT COLLEGE IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AS A NON PROFIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING AN EXEMPTION FROM STATE OVERSIGHT -- AS YOU MAY RECALL THE DECLINE IN ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS BY THE FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS ALLOWING SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TO GET AWAY WITH USING COMPLICATED FINANCIAL SCHEMES AND SHELL CORPORATIONS TO LAY CLAIM TO NONPROFIT STATUS AS A RESULT SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE NON THE NONPROFIT LABEL MISLEADING STUDENTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DODGING APPROPRIATE STATE OVERSIGHT THIS EMERGING PROBLEM IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS -- AS WAS DESCRIBED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THROUGH AB SEVENTY CALIFORNIA WOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- AND WITH ME IS BOB SHERMAN FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION -- WHO CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE FOLKS MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HAVE SEEN THIS -- THIS BILL LAST YEAR BUT PRETTY PRETTY MUCH THE SAME GENERAL APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT OPERATING IN -- WITHOUT -- WITHOUT SH FUNNELING MONEY IN THE WAY THAT -- FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION IS ALLOWED TO DO AND THAT THE -- BUREAU HAS THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU SEEN THAT WE -- NO HAVE A FOR A MOMENT I HAVE THE -- SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL MEDINA PRESIDENT CHOI -- ARAMBULA

WHATEVER MISSIONS ARE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE US WOULD YOU LIKE A DOCTOR CHOI THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK ALL RIGHT DIRECTION I HAVE A QUESTION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT SIR CAN YOU ELABORATE THE HOW WE CAN BE OVERSIGHT EIGHT I I I THOUGHT THE FIVE ONE TWO THREE THUS A MORE OF A FEW OF THE -- IRS SO WITH THAT THE -- FUNCTIONING AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE KERNEL FUNCTION OVERSIGHT -- MARGARET TRY AND THEN WHEN I GET A WRONG BOB CAN CRACK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER OR NONPROFIT INSTITUTION THAT CONVERTED FROM A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION AFTER ANYTIME AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TEN MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A NONPROFIT CORPORATION AND SO THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT THE AGE YOU WOULD LOOK AT IS THAT THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION ACQUIRED THE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS ASSETS FOR NO MORE THAN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS SO THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY MORE THAN THAN THE ASSETS ARE ACTUALLY WORTH THE INSTITUTION HAS NOT EXECUTED AGREEMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES -- THAT ALL CORE FUNCTIONS OF THE INSTITUTION ARE CONDUCTED BY OR UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION IN THAT IT DOESN'T FLOW THROUGH FROM A FOR PROFIT CORPORATION TO A NONPROFIT TO THE STUDENTS -- AND THAT THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CONTRACTS LOANS OR LEASES WITH THE TERM OF NO LONGER THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITH THE FORMER FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS OWNERS OR MANAGERS ON THAT SO IT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO JUST DO A LITTLE CHECKING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE KOSHER THAT THE THE FOR PROFIT COMPANY THAT IS NOW A NONPROFIT -- IS REALLY ACTING AS A NONPROFIT AND ISN'T ESSENTIALLY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE THE FOR PROFIT IN I'LL JUST ADD THAT THAT THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES HAVE OVERSIGHT OF NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE CHARTERED UNDER STATE LAW THE IRS -- IS THE IRS HANDLES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY ARE TAX EXEMPT FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES SO THE ACT SO GETS THE IRS FREQUENTLY IS INVOLVED IN THESE KINDS OF CASES BUT THE CORPORATIONS ARE STATE CHARTERED AND GENERALLY ATTORNEYS GENERAL AT THE STATE LEVEL -- IN FORCE NONPROFIT STATUS IRAN READING YOUR APPEARANCE HERE IS SO NEW TO BEAT UP CONFUSING TO ME -- BECAUSE -- CHIU NONPROFIT THE HIGHER EDUCATION ARE SHALL BE AND THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE OVER CITED A BY A -- BE PP BUREAU UP A PROP ITS ACT -- OF IT THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION RIGHT OKAY BUT THE YOU ARE NOUN CHANGING THAT LAW ALL WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IS THE IN OTHER WORDS BECAUSE THE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS TO LOOK INTO -- T. AT THE ACTIVITIES SO THE FUNDS MOST LIKELY I READ THE -- -- THE TWO DIFFERENT CASES -- ONE YOU SAYS THE SAME CO I I AM THE CEO OF A CORPORATION AND THE DBA A ONE FOUR FOUR PROP PROFIT THAT MEANS THE UNIVERSITY OF THE OTHER ONES -- X. Y. Z. -- NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION NONPROFIT AND UP ON FULL PROPERTY PROFIT RIGHT A MOBILIZATION RIGHT AND THE FOR PROFIT THAT DOESN'T MAKE MONEY THAN FROM NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH NORTH OVERSIGHT TO INCOME CAN BE DILUTED IN ALL THAT KIND OF ALL THE ACTIVITY WOULD REQUIRE INVESTIGATION AND WHOSE ROLE IS THAT THAT IS IT GONNA BE ATTORNEY GENERAL ALL IRS WHAT ARE YOU IN ARE YOU SUGGESTING SEPARATE ENTITY TO TO BE CREATED YES OF IT FOR THIS BILL IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- THIS IS FOR IF THERE IS A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION IN THAT OFFICE AND SAYS WAIT WE ACTUALLY WANT TO CHANGE WE DON'T WANNA BE A FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION ANYMORE WE WANT TO BECOME A NOT A NONPROFIT COLLEGE -- THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE THE ONE TO COME IN AND DO THE INVESTIGATION AND -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING AS A AS A REAL NONPROFIT AND NOT ESSENTIALLY USING -- -- SHELL GAME A KIND OF FAKE -- IT KIND OF CORPORATE STRUCK RESTRUCTURING ON TO ALL OF A SUDDEN GET THE BENEFITS OF A NONPROFIT WHEN THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY OPERATING AS AS A NONPROFIT MAY BE YOUR BILL CAN GO ONE STEP FURTHER AND NOT ALLOWING ONE ENTITY CO ONLY BECAUSE -- WOULD BECOME THE HEAD OFF OF A DIFFERENT PROFIT AND NONPROFIT YEAH THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST RIGHT THERE YEAH DOES IT IT DEFINITELY INTERESTING IDEA THAT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO YEAH YEAH IF YOU CAN NON REFINE AS IT MOVES ALONG AND I DON'T SUPPORT YEAH WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE IDEA I CAN'T PROMISE I TRYING TO PROMISE ANYTHING ON THE SPOT WITHOUT TALKING TO FOLKS -- BUT BUT HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT IDEA BECAUSE WE DO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID -- IS IS ONE PERSON YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY RUNNING BOTH INSTITUTIONS WITH THE FOR PROFIT INTERESTS AT HEART FOR THE -- THE WAY IS THAT THE NONPROFIT -- -- EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION THE OFFICES -- -- OR WILL BE OVERSEEING BY -- ATTORNEY GENERAL OR P.
