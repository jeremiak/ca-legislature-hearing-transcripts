SENATE SENATOR DODD MOVES A CALL WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO FILE ITEM THIRTY THREE SENATORS SKINNER ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP THIS ITEM. ALL RIGHT FILE ITEM THIRTY THREE COLLEAGUES MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACRYLATE HOUSING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SIGNED BY. HAPPY TO BE PRESENTING THIS BILL TO YOU FOR CONCURRENCE IT RECEIVED SIXTY SEVEN VOTES ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR YESTERDAY IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE TO HELP US ADDRESS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN EXTREME HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT CALIFORNIA HAS D. LOWEST NUMBER OF UNITS PER CAPITA. HOUSING UNITS IN THE US AND THAT SCARCITY HAS IMPACTED THE HIGH COST SIR OR HE WILL LEAD TO THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING THAT WE EXPERIENCE WITH SOME OF THE HIGHEST HOME PURCHASING PROCESS PRICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIRTY THREE OF THE FIFTY CITIES WITH THE HIGHEST RENTS ARE ALL OF RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT IS SB THREE THIRTY DO IT JUST SAYS IF YOU ARE APPLYING FOR A PERMIT FOR HOUSING THAT ALREADY MEETS THE GOVERNMENT ZONING AND DESIGN REVIEW GOALS TO IT ALREADY SIX THIS MORNING EXISTING DESIGN REVIEW IT DOESN'T REQUIRE VARIANCES. THAT ONCE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS DEEMED YOUR APPLICATION COMPLETE THEY WOULD SPEED UP THE PROCESSING OF THAT APPLICATION AND DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THEY ARE NOT PROCESSING THEY WOULD NOT CHANGE THE RULES OR INCREASED FEEDS ON YOUR OUT PATIENT. SO THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IT EXISTS FOR ONLY FIVE YEARS AS A SUNSET IN FIVE YEARS IT. IS ORDERED BY BLOWING BUSING COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR SKINNER. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES I JUST QUESTION ON THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS I NOTICE THE MINISTRY MOVE THOSE HOWEVER MY QUESTION IS WHETHER WE ARE STILL TIED TO THE DENSITY BONUS REQUIREMENTS AND I DON'T REMEMBER WE ARE DELIGHTED TO WHICH- TO THE DENSITY BONUS REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE IN A ANOTHER OF THE HOUSING BILLS AND I'M SORRY THE- ACTUAL BILL NUMBER ESCAPES ME BUT DENSITY BONUSES ARE BEING GIVEN. TO DEVELOPERS FOR INCREASING HOUSING AND WITHOUT A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO. READ REMOVE PARKING REQUIREMENTS OF WIND AND THEY GIVE THE DENSITY BONUS I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE AN OPTION ACTUALLY NOT TO GIVE THE DENSITY BONUS AND WITH THAT YOU CAN REMOVE PARKING. FIVE PERMISSION ANSWER CERTAIN. I'M I APPRECIATE YOUR RACING A COUPLE OF THOSE QUESTIONS FIRST OFF. IN TERMS OF ANY NEW BILLS THAT WE MIGHT PASS THIS YEAR. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LIVE YET. I CAN'T. ANSWER AND ANALYZE WHAT THEIR IMPACT MAYBE ON THIS BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE BILL THAT WAS ORIGINALLY BEFORE THIS HOUSE. WHICH DID PASS OUR FLOOR HAD PROVISIONS SUCH AS. LIFTING OR SUSPENDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS THAT IS BEEN REMOVED THAT IS NO LONGER IN THIS BILL. IT WAS ALSO IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. VISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE SUSPENDED FOR JUST THE FIVE YEARS THE BILL WAS IN THE FACT. THINGS LIKE VOTER APPROVAL FOR ZONING CHANGES AND OTHER VOTER APPROVAL MEASURES THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED OUT SO THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED QUITE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND MOST OF THE ISSUES THAT WHEN YOU SEE THE LIST OF CITIES THAT OPPOSE THE BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR LETTERS AND YOU SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY WERE OPPOSING THEY WERE OPPOSING EITHER THE FACT. THAT THERE WAS LIFTING OF MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS OR THAT IT THE BILL MIGHT HAVE OVER RIDDEN VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN REMOVED THEY ARE NO LONGER THERE AND THE CITIES THAT HAVE CAREFULLY RE LOOKED AT THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU. THEY WILL SEE THAT WHAT THEY HAD OBJECTED TO IS NO LONGER IN THE BILL AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS YOU SAW A SIGNIFICANT VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR DESPITE SOME OF THOSE CITIES OPPOSITION. AND IN MANY OF THE CITIES THAT MY STAFF AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO PERSONALLY ONCE WE WENT THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF THE BILL THEY ADMITTED THAT YES IT NO LONGER HAS THE THINGS THAT WE WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THIS BILL IS A VERY DIFFERENT FORM THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU IT STILL HAS SOME VERY IMPORTANT OF PROVISIONS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HELP GET THE OWNING THAT ALREADY MEETS LOCAL RULES. PERMITTED A LITTLE BIT FASTER. AND CERTAINTY TO THE PERSON TO THE APPLICANT SO THAT THE APPLICANT KNOWS THAT DURING THE TIME THE PERMIT IS BEING PROCESSED THE RULES ARE CHANGED AND FEES AREN'T RACIST. THANK YOU OUR MAN I THINK I AM GOING TO BE IN A SUPPORT ON THEIR STAND WITH ALL THOSE MINUTES THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE.

PROUD TO PRESENT SP FORTY EIGHT IT'S AN IMPORTANT RESOLUTION WHICH URGES THE LEADERS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACTIVELY OPPOSE AND AVOID ANY TERROR TARIFFS LEVIED ON MEXICAN GOODS. EARLIER THIS YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCES PLAN TO IMPOSE A FIVE PERCENTER OF ON MEXICAN GOODS GRADUALLY INCREASING AS MUCH AS- UP 225% WHICH WAS SET TO TAKE EFFECT ON JUNE TENTH TWENTY NINETEEN. TERRORISTS WERE CONTINUED ON THE FLOW OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES ON UNTIL MEXICO SUBSTANTIALLY SLOWED IMMIGRATION TEARS WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE ALTHOUGH SUCH TARIFFS HAVE SINCE BEEN. INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED. V. AMBIGUITY AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOR THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA FREE TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO A PRODUCT OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY TO BECOMING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD I OFTEN TELL PEOPLE. THAT CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO BUILD THINGS TOGETHER WE DON'T BUILD THINGS INDEPENDENTLY OR ECONOMIES HAVE BECOME INTERWOVEN. AND TERRORISTS ON MEXICAN GOODS OFTENTIMES WILL RESULT IN BECOMING A TERRIFYING CALIFORNIA ME GOODS AS WELL. SERVICE LIVE IT ON MEXICO WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO BOTH THE CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET AND THE ECONOMY IF TERRORISTS WERE IMPOSED APPROXIMATELY FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE LOST. NEARLY SIX HUNDRED NINETY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXPORTS TO MEXICO WOULD BE TARGETED TO TRADE RETALIATION. TO PRESERVE CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING AND% LUCRATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO AND TO ENSURE ECONOMIC SUCCESS RESULTING FACTOR FREE TRADE. FOR BOTH OF OUR STATE NATION WE MUST URGE THE LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY TO AVOID LIVING TERRACE ON MEXICO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPOD TODAY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.
