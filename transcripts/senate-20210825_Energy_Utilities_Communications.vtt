THE ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT AND

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:17.903
OTHER CHANGES WE PUT IN PLACE

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.072
IN ADVANCE OF THE SUMMER. AT

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:21.740

GOING TO HAVE TO MENTION. OVER

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.780
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.854
AND DECLINING HYDRO CONDITIONS

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.589
WE CLEARLY HAVE MOVED INTO A

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.257
NEW NORMAL. IT IS REQUIRED

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.926
EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS TO

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.260
BALANCE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:45.630

DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.934
IN COORDINATION WITH THE C. P.

C. AND C. E. C. THE I SO

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.304
TRIGGERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS OUR

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.839
BACKSTOP.PROCUREMENT

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.874
AUTHORITY. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.676
AN EMERGENCY MECHANISM THAT

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.311
ALLOWS US TO DIRECTLY PROCURE

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:00.712
ENERGY WHEN THERE'S BEEN

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:02.180
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:04.483
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.184
THE STATE'S RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.619
USING THAT AUTHORITY WE WENT

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.087
INTO THE MARKET YOU WERE ABLE

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.556
TO SECURE APPROXIMATELY SIX

00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:12.124
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATT

OF SEPTEMBER. THE EXTRA

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.667
CAPACITY HAS BEEN HELPFUL BUT

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.769
EVEN WITH THESE ADDITIONAL

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:25.103
RESOURCES WE STILL FIND

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.371
OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.739
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING GREAT

CONDITIONS. KIND OF CULMINATING

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.777

MAJORITY OF POWER SUPPLY FROM

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:37.949
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.117
CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE CONDITIONS

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:40.819
WERE CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.387
IN THE COMING RECENTLY AND

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.022

ADDITIONAL BACKUP GENERATION.

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.168
WHICH WILL OF COURSE ONLY BE

RATE CONDITIONS. WE ARE ALSO

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.273
VERY MUCH AWARE THAT SOME OF

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:02.541
THESE RESOURCES WILL RESULT IN

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:03.975
INCREASED POLLUTION WE'RE

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.143
COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING A

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.045
LOADING QUARTER APPROACH WHICH

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:07.913
WILL ALLOW FOR THE USE OF

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:17.722
ALSO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF DURING

BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOW

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:23.862
ABOUT TWO THIRDS F THE WAY

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.964
THROUGH THE SUMMER. WE NOTE

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.065
THAT EXTREMELY STRESSFUL

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:29.301
CONDITIONS TO PLAY OUT AGAIN IN

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:31.336
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. AND

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:32.103
WE OF COURSE NEED TO BE

PREPARED BY THE STATE TAKES ON

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:35.807
THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TASK

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:37.576
OF BRINGING NEW CAPACITY ON

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.044
SHORTBREAD. TO SOLVE

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.679
CHALLENGING THAT KEEP YOUR

HEALTHY RESERVE MARGIN FOR THE

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.735
STATE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:05.170
BIT MORE ABOUT TWO AREAS THAT%

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.905
WILL BE A MAJOR FOCUS FOR THE I

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:27.259
HELPFUL IN DEALING WITH BUT NET

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:28.693

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:37.015
TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF STRONG

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.584
COORDINATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:41.152
AND THE ADJACENT REGIONS FROM

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.154
WHICH WE BOTH. IMPORT AND

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.656
EXPORT ELECTRICITY BECAUSE

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:45.723
THEIR SIGNIFICANT

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.991
INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THESE

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.993
REGIONS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.361
OFFICE AND OVER THE LAST YEAR

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:51.629
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.731
SIMULTANEOUSLY VERY HOT. ALL

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.367
APART J. SYSTEM BY REGIONS AND

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:57.902
NOW WE ARE FORCED TO SPEND MUCH

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.471
MORE TIME COORDINATING CLOSELY

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.139
WITH THE TEAMS IN THE NORTHWEST

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:02.640
CARPOOL WITH FOLKS IN THE

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.676
DESERT SOUTHWEST SO THAT WE CAN

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.411
UNDERSTAND HOW THE LOADED

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.779
RESOURCE BALANCE IS CHANGING

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.147
THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES.

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:10.548
THESE OTHER UTILITIES ARE ALSO

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:11.816
UNDERTAKING SIGNIFICANT

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:13.551
DECARBONISATION OBJECTIVES

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:16.521
pAND GAS PLANT RETIREMENTS

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.155
HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.623
WEST AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.858
HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.259
NOW BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:23.328
CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:24.596
OF ELECTRICITY AVAILABLE TO

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.231
CALIFORNIA AND JUDGE ADJUST OUR

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.932
PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.100
ACCORDINGLY THERE HAS BEEN

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.336
TREMENDOUS VALUE OVER THE YEARS

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:32.804
FOR CALIFORNIA. J. SHOULD

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.205
REGIONS BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.807
ENERGY WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.275
WE CAN SHIP IT WHEN THEY HAVE A

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.776
SURPLUS WE CAN IMPORT IT BUT WE

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:40.445
ALSO NEED TO BE ATTENDED TO THE

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:42.313
CHANGES. AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.449
AS NECESSARY THANK THANK YOU

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.717

ANSWER DID ANYONE WANT TO ADD

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.624
ON TO THAT AND MAYBE- FROM PC

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.929
OR FROM THE. ENERGY COMMISSION

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.130
ANYTHING AT ALL DON'T MISS

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.565
CHECK THINGS THAT PRESS AND CEO

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.333
MEANS- EXPLAIN THE SIX. WELL WE

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.736
HAPPEN FOR SEVENTY DEGREES

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:05.637
IMPORTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:08.540
YEARS- WITH THE CHANGING OF OUR

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:10.341
ENVIRONMENT AND I MEAN NOT JUST

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:12.143
THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.312
NEIGHBORING STATES. ENVIRONMENT

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:18.950
AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT- WITH

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:20.585
SOME OF THOSE CHANGES WE HAVE

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:23.755
REALIZED THAT WE- WE DO NEED

00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:27.225
TO. BE MINDFUL OF ALL OF OUR

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:30.461
NEXT. TIME THERE IS A NEED SO-

00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:33.097
I THINK. THE THREE ENERGY

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:33.965
AGENCIES HAVE HEIGHTENED

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:37.435
AWARENESS AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.770
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:42.307
PLANNING PROCESS. TO REALIZE

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:44.342
SOME OF THE CHANGING US

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:45.410
SITUATIONS THAT WE'RE

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:48.046

THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:38.769
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON-

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.872
AS WE AS WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:44.275
AND THE PAST YEAR- YOU KNOW WE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.477
WERE IN A DROUGHT. WE'RE ALSO

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:48.613
SEEING FIRE AND WE'RE ALSO

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.982
SEEING A TRANS WHAT WE'RE

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.884
TRANSFORMING FROM. WE'RE GONNA

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.752
SHUT DOWN NUCLEAR DIABOLOS

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.320
GONNA GO DOWN IN A COUPLE YEARS

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:58.356
US LIKE THREE THOUSAND I THINK

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.424
TWENTY HUNDRED MEGAWATTS AND

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:01.826
YOU TALKED ABOUT AT THE I. S.

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.095
O. U. YOU WERE ABLE TO SECURE A

00:36:04.161 --> 00:36:05.763
COUPLE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS AT

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.266
THIS POINT AND SO WE'RE TRANCE

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.835
WE'RE WE'RE TRANSFORMING FROM

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:14.338
AN ENERGY SOURCE. THAT IS WHAT

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:16.841
IT WAS IS NATURAL GAS IT

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:19.176
NUCLEAR AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO I

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:21.112
HEARD YOU SAY BATTERIES HAS

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.014
THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS ON THE

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.951
COST AND RELIABILITY OF HOW HOW

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.319
WHAT THE COST TO THE RATEPAYERS

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:31.622
GONNA BE FOR BATTERY STORAGE TO

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:33.991
TAKE CARE OF US FROM WHEN THE

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:34.525
SUN IS NOT SHINING IN THE

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.027
WIND'S NOT BLOWING AND THE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:41.532
WATER IS NOT FLOWING. IT'S

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.868
DIFFICULT IN THIS FORMAT AND

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.870
CHRISTOPHER TO EITHER I'M

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.038
PRESIDENT PATRICK COMMISSION

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.306
GRANDER THINGS LIKE OFFERING

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:51.576
OPTIONS ON THAT YES. HE

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:53.311
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:56.314
PROCESS DOES EXACTLY THAT- LAST

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.550
YEAR DOLLY AND- WE ALSO

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:01.285
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:03.921
RATE IMPACTS- WE HAVE A

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:06.257
PROCEEDING THAT DOES THAT- THE

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.192
STRONGEST RATE IMPACTS

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:10.561
CURRENTLY REALLY. FOR OUR

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:12.396
CUSTOMERS FOR THE CUSTOMERS

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.998
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA R. ONE

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:16.434
LACK OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.169
SHOOT TRANSMISSION AND

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:23.140
DISTRIBUTION COSTS. BATTERY

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:26.243
STORAGE IT IS AS I THINK

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.312
PRESIDENT CEO MANGER ADDED

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.047
EARLIER IN HIS COMMENTS HAS

00:37:30.114 --> 00:37:32.216
BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:33.784
HELPING US MAINTAIN GRID

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:36.687
RELIABILITY THIS SUMMER AND WE

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.190
HAVE EASIEST DECISIONS

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.425
SUPPORTED DIGITAL STORAGE IT IS

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:43.995
COMING ON LINE AS WE SPEAK- AND

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:46.130
WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEXT

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:49.433
SUMMER TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.168
THREE. AND IN THE FUTURE- IN

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:52.870
THE I. R. P. IN THE INTEGRATED

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.338
RESOURCE PLANNING THERE IS

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.906
MORE- STORAGE THAT WILL BE

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:58.876
ADDED ON TO THE SYSTEM MORE

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:02.813
STORAGE IS THERE ANY IS THERE

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.017
BEEN ANY ANALYSIS ON THE COST

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:08.953
OF STORAGE OF ONE MEGAWATT SO

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.920
THAT WE COULD DO THE MATH WHEN

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:12.223
WE WHEN WE FIGURE OUT HOW MANY

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.424
MEGAWATTS WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:14.892
IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA PUT

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:18.462
IT INTO STORAGE- SO THAT THE

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:20.931
PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND GOING

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:23.100
FORWARD WHEN WE SHUT DOWN.

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:25.503
WHICH WE USED TO TALK ABOUT

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.471
GOING FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS.

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:28.572
AND THAT WAS CLEANER AND NOW

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.474
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:31.075
TAKING AWAY NATURAL GAS ARENA

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:34.111
GO TO BATTERIES. SO IT'S AN N.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:37.181
AS- WE WENT OFF OF COAL OUR

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.351
PRICES ESCALATED UP AND I'M

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:41.085
ASSUMING THEY'RE GOING TO GO UP

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:44.055
EVEN HIGHER. BUT WHEN WE GO TO

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.424
A DEGREE AT THAT HOUSE BATTERY

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.326
STORAGE. AND DOESN'T USE

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:57.435
NUCLEAR OR NATURAL GAS. YES IF

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:58.969
I MAY JUST BEFORE WE GO TO

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:02.473
ANSWER THAT ON IT THE POLICIES

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.676
OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE- AS

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.812
WELL AS AS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:10.815
AND NUMEROUS- THREE

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:13.551
ADMINISTRATIONS HAS DETERMINED

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:16.687
ARE VERY STRONG GHG GOALS WHICH

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.989
WE ARE REACHING TO A VARIETY OF

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.925
RESOURCES BATTERIES BEING VERY

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.461
IMPORTANT TO IT AND IN SO DOING

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:27.765
REACHING US GHG GOALS WE ARE

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:28.999
RETIRING THE USE. OF THE

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.668
RESOURCES THAT INTERNET

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:33.104
GREENHOUSE GASES. SO IN

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.841
ATTEMPTING TO HOLD VERY TIGHT

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:37.875
TO THE GOALS THAT THE PEOPLE OF

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.277
CALIFORNIA SELLER'S FLORES WE

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:43.314
ARE HAVING AN ENERGY MIX-

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.116
PROCURING AN ENERGY MIX THAT

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.917
INCLUDES BATTERIES IN TUCSON

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.452
VICE THIS DEVICE HERE TO YOUR

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:51.021
SPECIFIC QUESTION. ABOUT HAVE

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:54.125
WE CALCULATED THE COST OF THE-

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:59.563
COST OF A MEGAWATT BATTERY. I

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.500
NEED TO ASK AND RANDOLPH IS

00:40:02.566 --> 00:40:03.400
THERE ANY CHARGES DOING MANY OF

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:06.437
OUR RATE STUDIES TO ADDRESS

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.838
THANK OU PRESIDENT BADGER ON

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.440
YES AND AT RANDOLPH THAT NEED

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.142
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:14.078
AND CLIMATE POLICY THE U. C.

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.680
YOU TOO THE- SPECIFIC COST OF

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:21.485
BATTERIES- THE WAY THE P. YOU

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:22.653
SEE WHEN THEY DO THE-

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.188
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.490
PROCESS LOOKS AT. IS THEY TAKE

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:29.760
THE COST OF VARIOUS- OPTIONS

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:31.195
VARIOUS RESOURCES THAT COULD BE

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.464
ME USED TO MEET OUR RELIABILITY

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.399
AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.401
OPTIMIZES AGAINST US BUT WHEN

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.236
WE START TALKING ABOUT IN OUR

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.772
PROCUREMENT ORDERS- WHAT IS

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.507
NEEDED IN TERMS OF A CERTAIN

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.976
AMOUNT OF STORAGE OF SOLAR.

00:40:46.043 --> 00:40:48.779
WIND OF OFFSHORE WIND THAT IS

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:51.782
BASED ON OPTIMIZING- THE COST

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:52.283
IN PICKING THE LOW COST

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.652
PORTFOLIO ALL RIGHT WE ALSO

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.754
LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT-

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.590
IT IS CONSTRAINED BY THE-

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.859
ENVIRONMENTAL- POLICIES ARE SET

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:03.794
IN STATUTE- BUT THERE IS SOME

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:04.662
RANGE WITHIN THOSE

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.063
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY SO FOR

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.732
EXAMPLE- WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.135
DIFFERENCES IN COST BETWEEN-

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.571
HAVING A PORTFOLIO ELECTRICAL

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.773
IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S- A FORTY

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.709
SIX MILLION METRIC TONS. OF CO

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.110
TWO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ONE AND

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.879
A DEBT- THIRTY MILLION METRIC

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:22.947
TONS IN THERE ARE COST

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.448
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH ONE OF

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:26.917
THOSE- AND I CAN'T- RATTLES OFF

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.319
TOP OF MY HEAD BUT HAPPY TO

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:29.453
SHARE THOSE WITH YOU WITH YOUR

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.455
OFFICE- ADDITIONALLY THERE BEEN

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:34.491
A NUMBER OF- STUDIES DONE

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:38.162
OUTSIDE OF THE P. U. C. LOOKING

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.898
AT WHAT THE COST. OF MEETING.

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.733
THE CLIMBING GOALS WOULD BE OR

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.968
OPTIONS THE CLIMATE GOALS

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:46.036
INCLUDING THE SQ ONE HUNDRED

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.037
ANALYSIS THAT THE JOINT

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:49.907
AGENCIES HAVE DONE- AS REQUIRED

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:51.809
BY STATUTE- BUT TO NAME A FEW

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:54.378
OTHERS- A RECENT ANALYSIS DONE

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:55.646
BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ON

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.214
WHAT ORGANIZING THEIR GRADE

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:00.651
WOULD COST- AND WON- BY THE

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.621
GOLDMAN SCHOOL- LOOKING AT IT.

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:09.627
YOU. KNOW NATIONAL COST OF

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:10.394
DECARBONISING THE IN ALL OF THE

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.562
STUDY FAIRLY CONSISTS SHOW THAT

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:13.497
THE OF TO- CARBON FREE OR AT

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.065
LEAST A 90% CARBON FREE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:17.668
GRANITE- HE'S EITHER THE

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:18.969
MINIMUS OR SOME OF THE STUDIES

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:21.038
EVEN SHOW IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE.

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.840
THAN RELYING ON A GRID THAT

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:27.845
WOULD REQUIRE NEW- NEW CALL A

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:30.481
NEW NATURAL GAS VEHICLES THEN

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:32.683
AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.351
YOU WITH THE VIDEOGRAPHY OF ALL

00:42:34.418 --> 00:42:35.152
THESE REPORTS IF THAT WOULD BE

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.854
HELPFUL. THAT WOULD BE VERY

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.023
HELPFUL I ALSO WANTED TO JUST

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:41.025
POINT OUT THAT IN S. B. THREE

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:44.261
FIFTY I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:47.064
THE OPTION TO CAL LARGE HYDRO

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:50.401
AS PART IS OUT PERCENT GOAL

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:52.569
AND- BUT WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.071
PUT IN HYDRO I BELIEVE THAT

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:55.239
THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THOSE

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.373
SCENARIOS HAVEN'T BEEN PUT IN

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.543
AS PART OF THAT- 100% IS THAT.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:05.249
CORRECT. YEAH SURE GOOD NOW

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:06.383
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.820
THAT ABSOLUTELY AFTER SOME

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.855
BADGER- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:14.458
THOSE- QUESTIONS I JUST KIND OF

00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:17.094
FAT BUILDING OFF OF WHAT AND

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:17.895
MATURE AND ALL KIND OF

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:20.397
MENTIONED. TIME SIMILAR TO HOW

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.399
THE MODELING IS DONE IN THE IRP

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:25.302
PROCESS AND AS WELL AS THE SP

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.971
ONE HUNDRED. JUST A FEW THINGS

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.373
TO NOTE- AS AS MISTER RANDOLPH

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.176
MENTIONED WE OPTIMIZE THEM AND

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.811
BASED ON YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:34.745
ALL THE COST OF THE DIFFERENT

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.580
TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN WE

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:39.783
OPTIMIZE BASED ON CONSTRAINTS-

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.651
TWO TO THE CLIMATES BECAUSE WE

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:41.952
CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEN THE

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:43.587
LEAST COST PORTFOLIO THAT IT

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:46.023
THE LIABILITY AND SELECTED IT

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:46.790
AS A PLANNING ASSUMPTION FOR

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:49.393
THE FUTURE. SO BASED ON THOSE

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.029
ASSUMPTIONS RIGHT NOW ONE OF

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:54.231
THE CRITICISMS- OR FEEDBACK

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:55.666
WE'VE RECEIVED ESPECIALLY FROM

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:56.567
THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:59.470
COMMUNITY- IS THAT IS OUR LACK

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.405
OF TREATMENT OF NON ENERGY

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.707
BENEFITS. ARE ARE KIND OF

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:06.710
COSTING DOUBT A CARBON- FOR

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.512
SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES- THAT

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.947
THAT MAY BE STILL IN MEETINGS

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.383
SO JUST WHEN I NOTE THAT EVEN

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.817
THOUGH WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE THE

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.553
COST. AND THE COST OF EXAMPLE

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.489
AND GAS LEAK WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:20.624
MISSIONS ARE NOT COMPLETELY

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:22.493
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS A PART OF

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:24.361
THE ANALYSIS. SECONDLY TO YOUR

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.097
POINT ON THEIR LARGE HYDRO

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.732
THANK YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.834
THAT IT'S NOT A PART OF. OUR PS

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:33.537
BUT IT IS A PART OF THE SP ONE

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:41.011
HUNDRED ZERO CARBON- TECHNOLOGY

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.080
LAST I DON'T WANT IT WHAT ARE

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.248
WE COUNTED IF PART OF THE

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:44.848
LARGEST IS THE BILL TO CARRY

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:46.483
WHITE- WE COUNT IF I CAN

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.252
FURTHER CLARIFY THAT IN TERMS

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:54.191
OF- ANALYSIS ON GETTING TO OUR-

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.092
TWENTY THIRTY ONE IS THE POINT

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:56.193
WE'RE MODELING OUT TO RIGHT

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.430
NOW- THE MODELING DOES ASSUME

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:01.865
THAT ALL EXISTING LARGE HYDRO-

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:05.869
CONTINUES- TO EXIST. ON INDIAN

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:07.838
THERE- IT DOES NOT ASSUME THAT

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:10.607
ANY NEW LARGE HYDRO WOULD BE

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:13.877
BUILT- OUT THERE- I'M NOT AWARE

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:19.416
OF HE- PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT

00:45:19.483 --> 00:45:20.551
THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THAT

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.718
WOULD PRODUCE ENERGY ON WHERE

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:23.854
ONE'S THERE. WOULD BE USED FOR

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.622
WATER STORAGE OR OTHER PURPOSES

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.490
BUT WOULD PRODUCE VERY LITTLE

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:28.992
ENERGY. HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:32.863
BEYOND THE 60% R. P. S. TARGET

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:35.566
AND START TALKING ABOUT- CARBON

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.734
FREE THE ASSUMPTION IS ALL THE

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.337
EXISTING LARGE HYDRO- WITHIN

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.272
CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WEST

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:47.044
CONTINUES. TO BE UTILIZED TO

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:48.378
MEET THOSE GOALS THANK YOU MR

SPREAD OUT. OVER ALL LOAD

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:27.918

THOSE COSTS ARE SPREAD ACROSS

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.683

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:05.923
UNDERTAKEN AS PART OF WHAT'S

KNOWN AS OUR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.126
PREPARATORY WORK UNDERLYING

ASSUMPTIONS THE PLANNING.

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:13.297
MODELING HOW TO JUSTIN AND WE

OUR BALANCING AUTHORITY AND

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:21.939
CERTAINLY WE CERTAINLY DON'T

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.106
LIKE TO HAVE TO USE THAT TOOL

00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:25.976
GIVEN THE CONDITIONS WE ARE

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:26.443
FACING HOW WE FOUND IT

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.345
NECESSARY R. M. I FULL OF

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:31.615
QUESTIONS FOR THE PC. OUR

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.517
RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS THE ORDER

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.652
OF THE DAY AFTER THE TWO

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:37.588
THOUSAND ONE- ENERGY CRISIS AND

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:41.358
ON. THE SERVICE- PROVIDING AND

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.694
MAINTAINING- RELIABILITY SO WE

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.229
TRULY UNDERSTAND IT SINCE THE

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.464
CENTRAL. BUT IN THE LAST FIVE

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:48.532
YEARS A NUMBER RESOURCE

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.467
ADEQUACY CITATIONS AND FINES

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:53.770
HAVE INCREASED- QUITE

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:56.039
DRAMATICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:56.840
SIXTEEN I THINK THERE WERE

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:58.742
THREE CITATIONS LAST YEAR ALONE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:01.912
THERE WERE TWENTY. I'M CURIOUS-

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:04.281
COULD YOU EXPLAIN- WHAT YOU'RE

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:07.351
DOING TO REDUCE- THESE RESOURCE

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.453
ADEQUACY VIOLATIONS AND HA. P.

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:12.289
U. C. A RECENT DECISION AND

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.790
RESOURCE ADEQUACY OF

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.292
PROCEEDINGS IMPROVE THE

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:18.862
PROGRAM- BECAUSE MANY FEEL IT'S

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.465
CHEAPER TO PAY THE FINE. AND

00:48:21.531 --> 00:48:24.034
CITATION THEN TO PROCURE THIS

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.402
POWER SO WHAT TOOL ARE YOU

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:28.005
GOING TO USE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:31.441
THESE- COMPANIES ARE ACQUIRING

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:32.843
THE POWER VERSUS JUST STICK IN

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:36.413
THE FINE SENATOR BRADFORD

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.948
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:40.951
HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN ARMED

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:44.321
RESOURCE ADEQUACY FINE AND-

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:45.856
FRANKLY I FIND IT PRETTY

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:49.760
DISTURBING- AND PARTICULARLY IN

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.862
THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:53.864
OURSELVES IN THIS YEAR OR NEXT

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.734
YEAR. AND FRANKLY FOR THE NEXT

00:48:57.801 --> 00:49:00.504
FIVE YEARS BOTH DEMAND RESPONSE

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.938
IN RESOURCE ADEQUACY ARE

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.607
CRITICAL AND CRITICAL TO

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:05.976
KEEPING IT RELIABILITY OF THE

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:08.078
GRID- IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE WE

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:09.746
DOING ABOUT IT SOME OF THE

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:10.814
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE CAN

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.149
CERTAINLY LOOK AT IT'S A

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.885
GREATER FINE- IN TERMS OF THE

00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.321
PENALTY FOR. WHICH SHE WILL

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:19.556
DESCRIBE SOME OF THE ENTITIES

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.591
THAT ARE CONSIDERED PART OF THE

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.126
RESOURCE ADEQUACY PORTFOLIO

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.695
FIND IT EASIER TO PAY THE FINE

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:27.364
THAT THEY DO TO- PROVIDE THE

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.599
ENERGY SO I DON'T KNOW AND YOU

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.701
WANT TO ADD A COUPLE THINGS TO

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:35.105
THAT I'M SURE AGAIN. THANK YOU

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:37.674
PRESIDENT DR- YEAH I MEAN IT IS

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.210
AN EXCELLENT POINT THE- THE

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:42.079
FINES FOR VIOLATION OF RESOURCE

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:44.214
ADEQUACY AT THIS POINT ARE

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.749
SOMETIMES LOWER THAN THE ACTUAL

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.818
COST IN THE OPEN MARKET GOING

00:49:47.884 --> 00:49:50.721
OUT AND BUYING CAPACITY AND SO

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:53.857
WE ARE- YOU KNOW WE DO SUSPECT

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.025
THAT SOME LOADS ARE ENTITIES

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.893
WOULD RATHER JUST PAY THE FINE

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.161
THEY GO OUT THERE AND BUY

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:59.596
RESOURCE ADEQUACY ON THE FLIP

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:03.033
SIDE I AM AWARE OF- MANY OF THE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.970
ONES ENTITIES BOTH- YOU READERS

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.739
AND I ARE USED TO CONTINUE TO

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:12.476
BUY RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND AVOID

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:15.312
THE PENALTIES EVEN IF THE COST

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.513
OF COMPLIANCE IS HIGHER THAN

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.182
THE PENALTIES- IT BRINGS INTO

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.418
QUESTION KIND OF A RE LOOK AT

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.053
THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY SET UP AS

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.422
A WHOLE- YOUR SPECIALLY

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:27.991
CONSIDERING THAT IN THIS DAY

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:30.260
AND AGE WE NOW HAVE OVER THIRTY

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:32.829
DIFFERENT- LOAD SERVING

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:34.431
ENTITIES THAT NEED TO

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:35.632
PARTICIPATE IN THE RESOURCE

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.701
ADEQUACY PROGRAM. WHERE WHEN

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:40.337
THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED- AND

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.905
IT WAS A SMALL HANDFUL OF IT

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:43.373
HE'S ACTIVE PARTICIPATE IN IT

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.941
SO THE DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.877
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS. IN

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.844
OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.579
PROCEEDING THERE IS A TRACK

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.782
THAT IS LOOKING AT EXACTLY THAT

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:54.851
QUESTION ON DO WE NEED TO-

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.986
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A DO WE

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.287
NEED TO HOW DO WE REDESIGNED

00:50:57.354 --> 00:51:00.357
THE PROGRAM TO BETTER MATCH-

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.325
THE CURRENT RETAIL AND

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:03.493
WHOLESALE MARKETS ARE OUT

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.430
THERE. UNFORTUNATELY I HOPE AS

00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:11.268
YOU CAN IMAGINE- THE TITLE N.

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:12.769
OF REDESIGNING A MARKET LIKE

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.905
THIS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:17.407
DO OVERNIGHT- IT'S BEEN BEING

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:20.243
DISCUSSED FOR. THE PAST NINE

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.578
MONTHS OR SO THROUGH A SERIES

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.547
OF WORKSHOPS AND HELMETS FOR

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:25.482
PARTIES- IT WILL LIKELY

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:27.884
CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR-

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:33.190
BEFORE. THERE'S A FULLY

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:33.757
DEVELOPED STAFF PROPOSAL ARE

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:34.724
USEFUL WITH I THINK YOUR EX

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:35.992
WITH IS CLEAR THE PROBLEM THAT

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.661
IS EXISTED IN THE PROBLEM THAT

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.429
EXISTS AND THIS WHOLE UTILITY

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.665
SPACE RIGHT NOW IS. BEING
