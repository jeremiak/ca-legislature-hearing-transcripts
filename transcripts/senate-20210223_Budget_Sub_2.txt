THANK YOU SENATOR THIS IS DAN ADLER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR CLIMATE FINANCE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK ON THE FUNDING CHANNELS FUNDS FOR YOUR COMMUNITY HERE TODAY WITH YOU AND YOURS IN BALTIMORE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE CATALYST FUND- IN GENERAL AND MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THIS ISSUE VERY. INCOME SUPPORT ACT. BUT BRINKLEY AND THE THAT I HAVE I WANT TO GET. OVERVIEW OF THE GOAL HERE IN A IS TO CREATE A SIGNET WHAT WE THINK IS A SIGNIFICANT NEW TOOL IN THE STATE'S TOOL SET HER DRESSING CLIMATE AND ADVANCING EQUITABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS IN THE MODE OF DEVELOPMENT FINANCE MEANING ASSERTIVE APPROACH TO ALLOCATING PUBLIC CAPITAL FINANCING THE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT IN A WAY THAT USES FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AND LEVERAGES PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION TO ACHIEVE MUCH GREATER SCALE- THIS IS A BUSINESS MODEL THAT EXISTS AND NOW TWELVE OTHER STATES AND WE'RE NOT PROBABLY KNOWN AS GREEN BANKS. AND IS INCREASING IN POPULARITY AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING A FEDERAL LEVEL- WE CAN BUILD INTO THAT AS YOU LIKE. YOUR CAL HAS YOU IN THE COUNTRY IS THE EXISTING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. WHICH HAS MOBILIZED OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL OVER ITS LIFE INCLUDING NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT LENDING. AND HAS AN ESTABLISHED AFTER PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE MAKING IMPORTANT CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS. ANY OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO HANG THAT AT OUR CLIMATE AND RESILIENCY INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES- WITH THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF LEVERAGING PRIVATE MONEY SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONSIDERATION AND CONCERN AROUND CROWDING OUT PRIVATE CAPITAL WITH THIS APPROACH. IT'S QUITE THE CONTRARY BY PARTICIPATING STRATEGICALLY WITH LIMITED AMOUNTS OF TARGETED PUBLIC MONEY. WE BELIEVE WE CAN OPEN UP. PRIVATE CAPITAL AND SIGNIFICANT MULTIPLES THE VISION TO ACHIEVE OUR ON OUR HANDS. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE WILL NEVER GET WHERE WE NEED TO BE JUST ON PUBLIC MONEY HELLO. SO HEARD I SEVENTY WHICH WERE PASSED SUMMER. THIS IS. AIMED AT SETTING A DATE SET UP THE FRAMEWORK FOR OTHER CHANNELS FONG WILL OPERATE. IN AS OPPOSED TO LAST YEAR'S EFFORT WHICH WAS A TOP DOWN LARGE SCALE FUNDING APPROACH THIS IS GOING SECTOR BY SECTOR RETHINK WE HAVE REAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO UNLOCK MARKETS AND ADVANCE THE STATE'S POLICY GOALS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR OUR AGENCY COLLEAGUES WERE SETTING THE POLICY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITIES THIS IS A FUN PICKING UP. ACTUATE THOSE POLICY GOALS. IN THIS SECTOR IN PARTICULAR WHICH CONTRIBUTES DOCUMENTARY PERCENT STAGE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE SEE SOME REAL NEEDS FOR CAPITAL AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN METHANE MANAGEMENT IN ORGANIC WASTE OF GOOD PROCESSING IN PARTICULAR. BUT WE ALSO SEE THE REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SECTOR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE. GREENHOUSE GAS AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. WITH CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY WITHHYDROGEN PRODUCTION ADVANCED BIOFUELS MARC SOIL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ALL THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MATURE. BUT NEED A NUDGE TO GET THE PRIVATE MORTGAGE SUBJECT. TO TAKE OFF AND FUND THE MASCARA. OUR OUR REGION BUT- RUBIO THAT THERE IS A- INTEREST PROJECT. ACROSS THE CLAIMANTS MORE AGRICULTURE SPACE- DID ON THE GOVERNOR. AND IN. FROM SERIES CAPITAL PROVIDERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT SEE THIS AS PART OF THIS IS DANIEL ECONOMY OF THE FUTURE. AND LOCAL PARTICIPATION CALIFORNIA MARKETS WHERE THEY CAN MANAGE IT- AND THIS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY CAN MARRY WITH THEIR PRIVATE CAPITAL AGAIN INSIGNIFICANT. THIS IS THE PASSED IN FOR THEM AND THEY NEED A PARTNERSHIP FROM GOBIZ IN IRAQ- LASTLY MY WAY ENTERED. I BUT THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THIS CATEGORY COULD NOT APPEAR IN THE SEC REPORT THIS RICHARD ROTH COUNCIL REPORT- AS WE WERE PUTTING FORWARD TO CONCEPTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AB SEVENTY EIGHT WE HAVE A LIST THAT WAS ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND THE HIGH LEVEL POSSIBLE THE STATE. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP ON THE FIRE SIDE IN PARTICULAR FOR FORCED BINANCE UTILIZATION THE PREPARE THE REPORT PRESS YOU SEE AND THEN WERE MADE AWARE THAT CDFA HAD AN INTEREST IN WORKING WITH OUR BANK FOR SIMILAR PURPOSES. IT WAS TOO LATE TO PUT IT IN THE REPORT WE DID BRIEFLY SEC ON THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND IT WAS PROBABLY ENDORSE. I THINK THAT'S ANY- EXAMPLE OF KEYBOARD. THAT THIS FUND CAN ENABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WITH FOUR DEPARTMENT OF ON THE FOR SIDING WITH CDFA LOOKING AT THIS ONE VEHICLE AS IMPORTANT TO ADVANCE THEIR GOALS. YEAH I MAKING THE CATALYST FUNDER VOICE FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP. BEGAN DRIVING LEVERAGE ADVANCING POLICY GOALS CREDIT CROWDING IN PRIVATE CAPITAL AND HOPEFULLY ENGAGING IN A MINISTER OF STRATEGIC CONVERSATION WITH YOURSELF AND ARE YOU. SEE COLLEAGUES. FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO ALLOCATE THAT MONEY GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU- AS OUTLINED IN THIS IN THE STAFF REPORT YOU KNOW WHEN BEFORE WE GET TO THE ALLEY- AND I KNOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE THERE. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE PASSED LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT WE WILL FUND IS FROM NON STATE. FUNDS NON GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS THAT WAS THE DEAL. THAT WAS MADE. NOW SIX MONTHS LATER. THE GOVERNOR'S COMING BACK WITH NOT ONLY FUNDING IT WOULD STAY FUNDS. A BUT FINDING IT CONTINUOUSLY WITH STATE FUNDS B. AND THEN EARLY ACTION SO IT'S- I GUESS THE QUESTION WILL BE ASKED IS. IS WHAT GOOD DID THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE AT THE END OF THE YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHEN. THE LESSONS A HALF A YEAR LATER WE'RE COMING BACK WITH THE ENTIRE THE ENTIRELY OPPOSITE. AND PUT ASIDE. THE VALUE OF A GREEN BANK AND ALL THAT CAMPUS OF JUST A REGULAR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. SURE I CAN GIVE YOU. OF MY PERSPECTIVE THAT IN THE COURSE OF. WHAT WAS A FAIRLY EASY TO GO. PREVIOUS EIGHT LAST YEAR WHICH MEANT THAT. WAS AIMED AT SETTING A FRAMEWORK AND DISSIPATING BUT FEDERAL STIMULUS IN THE NEAR TERM. WE NEED TO SET THIS ONE UP TO RECEIVE. THOSE DOLLARS. THE DESIGN OF THE LANGUAGE DESIGN IF YOU LIKE LANDED ON FEDERAL ONLY. AND IN MY JUDGMENT WENT TOO FAR IN PRECLUDING FOR ALL TIME THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF STATE ALLOCATION TO SUPPLEMENT. THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS. BOB SO IT WAS DEFINITELY THE NEGOTIATION BUT I THINK IT WAS. AN OVERSTAFFED AND THIS IS A CHANCE TO RECONSIDER THAT AND SAY AND IN SPECIFIC LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO PUT STATE DOLLARS WELL INTO THIS ONCE ABOUT THAT IS THERE. THE REQUESTED HE LIKE TO RECONSIDER THAT A TERMINATION WHICH IN MY JUDGMENT WAS MADE A LITTLE BIT HASTILY AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR. THIS PHARMACY. APPROPRIATION OR CONTINUOUS FLOWING FUNDS. IT'S A ONE TIME ALLOCATION. WITHOUT ASKING AT THIS STAGE FOR FURTHER ALLOCATIONS FOR THE SECTOR. THE BEAUTY OF THE ROBOT FUND IS THEY WANT MONEY IS THE- TO THE- EN ROUTE BE READ. BUT THERE'S NO CONTINUOUS. FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN THIS CASE- AND THEN LASTLY FOR THE URGENCY MEASURE DATA. WANTED TO THE FORCE PRIVATE SECTOR. IS REALLY RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF YOU USE THIS FOR SPEECH ACT MORE AGGRESSIVELY. FREE MARKETS TO DRAWDOWN OF THE WILDFIRE RISK IT HAS A CHANCE TO DO SOME EARLY ACTION TO DECREASE WILDFIRE RISK IS NOT GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COURSE. BUT IT IS URGENT AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHY IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR EARLY ACTION BUDGET ITEM FOR HORSE THE PRESS ALWAYS JUMP JUMP INTO THE WILDFIRE. PORTION OF DEATH THE GROUP IS- A ONE LAST. TIME IS. MR WU MY BANK IN. WANT TO GO ON ALEJO. YES I I'M HERE. GREAT GO AHEAD PLEASE YOU HAVE. THEN I WOULD CONCUR WITH WITH DAN EXPRESS THAT WAY AND- THE I'M CAL'S FONG WAS SET UP LAST BUDGET CYCLE. HE WAS IN LIGHT OF THE PENDING AND- STILL THERE WERE WORK ONE IN THEIR WAY THROUGH BOTH THE U. S. SENATE AND U. S. HOUSE WE WERE ALL HOPEFUL THAT THOSE ONE OF THOSE GOALS WE GET PAST THAT WOULD PROVIDE CAPITAL FOR THE CLIMBING HILLS FINE. AS WELL WHERE NONE OF THEM HAD PASSED IN THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY AT THE TABLE AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW. GOING TO THE HOUSE FOR A VOTE ACTUALLY ON FRIDAY AND SO THERE THERE MAY BE FEDERAL FUNDS ON THE WAY BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT. YEAH I WORK VERY HARD WITH DYNAMIC TEAM AND THEY GO BIZ WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF PERSPECTIVE FINDING THE CHEAPEST SIMILAR GOALS AND THEREBY NECESSITATING THIS SET OF CHANGES. THAT WE WERE OPENED UP FOR TODAY. OKAY OUR- GOOD MORNING THIS IS A BRAND WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- REGARDING THE CLIMATE FUND CATALYST IN GENERAL LAST YEAR- WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO ESTABLISH THE FUND AT THE TIME WE NOTED IT COULD BE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR CLIMATE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION PROJECTS. WE DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS HOWEVER AND SUGGESTED THAT IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THIS CONCEPT THAT THE LEGISLATURE FIRST FUND A PILOT PROJECT. AND THIS PROPOSAL AND THE- THE FORCE PROPOSAL ALONG WITH THAT ARE CENTRALLY SUCH A PILOT PROJECT. SO REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY- ADVISER ADLER MENTIONED- THAT THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IS A SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IN THAT THERE ARE- IT'S ACTUALLY PROJECTS THAT- COULD BENEFIT FROM LOW COST LOANS. TO HELP THESE PROJECTS- MOVE FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW MISTER ADLER ADDRESSED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS PROJECT FITS IN WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL CLIMATE. AND STRATEGY AS HE NOTED WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE LIST OF. HIGH PRIORITY- ITEMS- IDENTIFIED BY THE STRATEGIC PRESS COUNCIL BUT- HE HAS EXPLAINED- THIS MORNING- WIDEOUT WHY THAT CAME ABOUT- REGARDING THE CONCERNS YOU RAISED- YES THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT INCLUDE- INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT NO STATE FUNDS WERE TO BE USED FOR THE FUND. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A CHANGE TO STATUTE TO ALLOW THE PHONE TO ACCEPT STATE FUNDS SO THIS IS- AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REEVALUATE WHETHER THEY WANT TO FUND THIS- YOU PROGRAM OR NOT IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES APPROVE FUNDING FOR THE CLIMATE CATTLE SPEND WE WOULD RECOMMEND EXPANDING SLIGHTLY THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I'M TO HELP YOU ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. IS IT IS A CONCERN FROM THE AUDIO ON THE- MECHANISM FOR THE FUNDING YOU KNOW IT'S A SEEMS LIKE THEY THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S THESE LOANS THAT THEY CAN GET IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OR SKY HIGH INTEREST RATES AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LENDING OR IS IT THE PARTICULAR PROJECTS THAT BY BANKS WERE. FOUND TO BE AS WE WOULD CHOOSE WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. IT'S MORE THE FORMER IT'S THAT- ITS STATE. LOANS FOR PRIVATE PROJECTS CAN BE DEPENDING ON ON THE RISK IN THE- FAMILIARITY OF THE MARKET WITH SERVICE PROJECTS CAN BE ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR- SOME PROJECTS THERE MIGHT BE LOWER COST FINANCING AVAILABLE BUT THOSE PROJECTS MAY NOT NEED THE SORT OF FUNDING AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS FUND- DEPENDING ON THAT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS IN THE RISKINESS. IT MAY EITHER BE. IF IT'S IF IT'S- IF REPLACING A VERY HIGH INTEREST RATE LOANS THAT PROJECT MIGHT BE RISKY AND% THEN THIS THE FUND WILL NOT BE REPAIRED AND IT CAN'T BE SELF SUSTAINING AS ENVISIONED. AND IF THE PROJECTS ARE. TOO SAFE THEN THEY PROBABLY DO HAVE ACCESS TO PRIVATE CAPITAL THE SPEND COULD BE SERVING TO CROWD OUT SO WE'RE THIS FUND IS POSITIONING ITSELF IS IN THE MIDDLE- TO CROWD IN PRIVATE CAPITAL. AND WHAT WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO START WITH A SMALLER PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS- LAST LECTURES PROGRAM HAVE MUCH BROADER. SCOPE SO- SO IF YOU PRACTICE YOU CAN- HOPEFULLY COLLECT DATA TO SEE THAT THE PROJECTS BEING FUNDED ARE IN THAT SWEET SPOT AND THAT WE ARE CROWDING OUT PRIVATE CAPITAL OR TAKING ON TOO MUCH RISK EXCELLENT ADVICE- CHAIR DOLLY. AND THEN CENTER STERN. THE YOU MR CHAIRMAN I MY FIRST. IS WHAT WHAT ARE THE FEDS BRINGING TO THE TABLE WHAT WHAT I MEAN IN THE LEGISLATION I I'M NOT SEEN OUT IS IT JUST DOLLARS FOR THE POLICY. AT THIS STAGE OF ITS BEING SHAPED AND DESCRIBED AS THE CLEAN ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY ACCELERATOR WHICH REALLY HAS TWO COMPONENTS. WELL NUMBER ONE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DOLLAR FIGURE SO CORONER DEUCE IN BOTH CHAMBERS AND THAT'S NOW PARTISAN SUPPORT. HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND CRITICAL CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OF BY AND I WAS NEWLY ESTABLISHED INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT GREEN BACK. BUT THE BULK OF THE WORK WILL BE TO FLOW CAPITAL TO STAY GREEN BACKS- IN A RANGE OF CATEGORIES WHICH BROADLY REFLECT THE STATE'S GOING TO PRIORITIES AND STOPPING PLAN ELSEWHERE- GET INTO A IN A LOW COST REVOLVING LOAN PURCHASES SUCH AS THE ONE PRESCRIBING HERE. THERE'S A COMPONENT OF POLICY PRESCRIPTION THAT 40% OF THE CAPITAL TREAT UNDERSERVED MARKETS AND DRIVE INCLUSION BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S NOT STIPULATING POLICY GOALS FOR THE CLIMATE SECTOR OTHER THAN WHAT IS ALREADY. IN THE INDIVIDUAL STATE LAWS. HE SAID HUNDRED BILL. UNDER BILL TOTAL. THIS WOULD BE TO WHAT WOULD CONSIDERED CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THINK ABOUT LARGE SCALE TRANSMISSION. TEXAS VERSUS WHAT CLOSE TO THE STATE'S RETURN. I'LL THAT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET THAT'S THE TOP LINE NUMBER. SO I NOTICED THAT COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION- I'M I'M PRETTY ON BOARD WITH YOU KNOW DOING INCENTIVES BUT HI I SOMEBODY UP FOR SOME OF ARMOR NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO. I LIVE IN THE FOREST AND IT'S BURNING DOWN EVERY DAY AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF- TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE I THINK I MENTIONED IT WAS THE LAST. TIME WE ARE HEARING THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S- THEY'RE TAKING RICE STRAW AND MAKING PRESS BORED OUT OF IT AND THE REASON THEY'RE DOING THAT AND THIS IS PRIVATE. INVESTMENT NO HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT. NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF RICE STRAW THE FARMERS NEED SOMEPLACE TO GO WITH IT AND- IT'S REDUCING CARBON. IT'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. IN THIS CASE WE'RE WE'RE INCENTIVIZING HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT IT'S THE POLICY. THAT CAUSES THE PROBLEM. IT IS A POLICY NOT CAL A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM IS IF IT'S IF FOR THIS CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE POLICIES ARE HORRIBLE IN THE SUPPLY OF PRODUCT. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE SO THE FOR SERVICE WHAT DOES PROJECTS BUT I CALM SPLAT THERE'S PROJECT HERE THERE'S A PROJECT A HUNDRED MILES AWAY. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FIFTY MILES AWAY AND THERE'S NO CONTINUOUS SUPPLY. OF THIS WOODY BIOMASS THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BEAT THEM DOWN THE FOREST. AND SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE NEED IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DRESS IS. WE NEED TO GO FIRST IN MY OPINION WE NEED TO GO WATERSHED BY WATERSHED TO TAKE A WATERSHED. AND WE SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA TREAT THIS WATERSHED. SO WE DIDN'T THEIR SERVE DIFFERENT WATERSHEDS IN CALIFORNIA. WE SAY OKAY W'RE TALKING ON THIS WATER SHOULD WE DO A. THE STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT SO THIS SAYS THE FOR SERVICE WILL SUPPLY. THE COMMODITY THAT COMES OUT OF THIS WATERSHED IS SOON AS YOU GET THAT DONE. WHAT WE NEED WE NEED SOME REASON HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HER TO SAY WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS THERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE TO DO THESE OTHER THEIR THIRD OF BIO FUEL PLANT IN LAKEVIEW OREGON HUNDRED MILES FROM MY HOME THAT IS MAKING. BIOENERGY OP OF FORCED RESIDUE- SO I THINK FOR US IT'S MORE OF A POLICY FIXED AND IT IS A MONEY FIX WE NEED TO SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA GO WATERSHED BY WATERSHED ENTREATIES WATERSHEDS WE CAN THROW MONEY AT IT ALL DAY LONG AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET PRIVATE INVESTMENT PRIVATE PEOPLE WILL COME WHEN THEY CAN GO TO THEIR BANK. AND THEY CAN TELL THE BANK HEY I HAVE A TWENTY FIVE YEAR SUPPLY OF PRODUCT THAT WE CAN TURN INTO YOU KNOW WHATEVER BIOFUELS YOU NAME IT BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT THAT INVESTMENT IN THERE UNTIL WE HAVE SOME MATURITY. THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET THE FEEDSTOCK. SO THAT'S THAT'S MYCOMMENTS HAVE BEEN PUSHING ON THIS AND I AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO HAVE AS LIKE. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HERE IN TO THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO MANAGE THE 60% LANDED IS BURNING UP. YOU KNOW. WE SEE. BILL AFTER BILL COMING THROUGH THIS HOUSE. ABOUT WILDLIFE MEAN WE'RE STOP WHATEVER THE BEAR BILL TOP HONEY BEAR I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU FOUR MILLION ACRES BURNED UP LAST YEAR MORE WILDLIFE GOT DESTROYED LAST YEAR IN HABITAT. FROM FIRE. THEN WILL EVER DO BY HUNTING OR FISHING OR WHATEVER THE HECK ELSE WE'RE DOING WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR OUR- OF OUR MEADOWS IN OUR IN OUR STREAMS. AND THAT IS BY PUTTING FIRE BREAKS IN SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE OUR FOR SO I JUST WANT TO GET THAT OUT IN THE OPEN IT'S FRUSTRATING IS HACKED. TO ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE MONEY. AND NEVER FOCUS ON THE POLICY. FOR STERN. THANKS MISTER CHAIR GOOD TO BE PHYSICALLY WITH YOU YES IT IS NICE YEAH YEAH- IT DOESN'T MISS AT MISTER WU- I GUESS BUILDING ON- MY FROM THE NORTH QUEST OR POINT- YOU KNOW THE SAN PASSED. EARLY I DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE WAY THIS BUT I THE BILL YEAR BETWEEN FIFTY TO ESTABLISH A CLAIM A CATALYST FUND IN LAW- THAT HAD OF. SORT OF BROADER MANDATE THEN. THEN I GUESS WE'RE SEEING HERE TODAY- IN TERMS OF SORT OF GOING SECTOR BY SECTOR WITH SOME PARTICULAR MARKET INTERVENTIONS INTO. TRYING TO. ESTABLISH MORE OF A HOLISTIC. VIEW OF WHAT LEVERAGING CAN BE- AND WHAT. SORT OF MARKET DEVELOPMENT CAN BE AND HOW WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE AS A AS PUBLIC ENTITIES SO THE LEGISLATION ACTUALLY. WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECIFICALLY STRUCTURED AROUND- PUBLIC CAPITAL NOT PRIVATE CAPITAL IN THE BUDGET DEAL IS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT THE BUDGET DEAL FLIP THAT ON ITS HEAD AND SAID. NO ACTUALLY IT'S LIKE A FEDERAL RECEIVING PROGRAM AND THAT'S WE HAVEN'T LAW RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE'S SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION YOU'RE HEARING IS. THERE A WILLING WILLINGNESS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE AND GET HANDS ON ABOUT NOT JUST THE STRUCTURE THE AUTHORITY BUT TO MAKE SURE THE UNDERLYING POLICY ARCHITECTURES. THAT SORT OF DR VISSER COHESIVE- SO AS WE'RE DEBATING. AGRICULTURE AND YOU KNOW THIS SORT OF. ANY USE FEEDSTOCK MARKET DEPLOYMENT AND THE WILD FIRE PECES WELL- I JUST I'M CURIOUS HOW ARE YOU GUYS AT THE AT THE CATALYST TRYING TO ALSO LOOK AT SORT OF THE BROADER MARKET PLACE AND LOOK AT WHERE YOU SEE OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA IF THAT HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS DOES SHOW UP AND- THE I MEAN IS A ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AND I THINK YEAH THE HUNDRED BILLION WAS IN THE BIG BIG. THANK YOU BETTER SPACE YOU MENTIONED THE DEPTH OF THE TOTAL DOLLAR FIGURES LOOKING EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT BUT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING MORE BROADLY AT- WHAT IS CLIMATE CATALYST CAN DO AND I GUESS WHAT THE POLICY GAPS ARE THAT YOU SEE. IN HIBBING YOUR ABILITY TO DO MORE I THINK THAT KIND OF INTERFACE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN BRINGING BACK SOME OF THOSE KEY ITEMS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD HELP PUT SOME MEAT ON THE BONES OPPOSE JUST SORT OF. THINKING ABOUT ALL THIS SO HYPOTHETICALLY SO JUST IT DIDN'T COMMENT ON THAT MR WE WERE MISTER ADLER JUST THE BROADER BROADER PURPOSE AND SORT OF HOW TO HOW TO MAKE IS THERE ANY TEND TO MAKE THIS ARCHITECTURE PERMANENT- OR DO YOU RY TO JUST ENVISIONED THE STATE ROLE JUST BEING. SMART AGRICULTURE AND WILDFIRE. FOR NOW AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH EVERYTHING ELSE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR STERN SO LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION'S INITIAL INTENT. WAS MORE ALONG THE LINES THAT YOU JUST EXPRESSED. A MUCH LARGER MUCH BROADER A STATE FUNDED A VEHICLE THAT WOULD HAVE. A MANDATE TO LOOK ACROSS TIME TO CHANGE ALLEGORIES. AND BE IMPACTFUL WHEREVER- IT'S ALL I NEED. GIVEN THE BUDGET SITUATION THAT AROSE. EARLY LAST SPRING- THOSE FUNDS I DIDN'T MATERIALIZE. AND THEREFORE WE ARE NOT LIMITED. IN OUR SCOPE BY THE FUNDS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE. AND SO WE WILL USE THESE FUNDS. VERY PROPERLY LOOK FOR OPT. TO PROVIDE DEMONSTRATION OF FACTS AS A CATALYST TO DEMONSTRATE BOTH THE DEMAND AND NEED AND THE ABILITY OF OUR PROGRAM TO MAKE AN IMPACT AND THEN CONTINUED DURING THAT PROCESS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL ARGUED THAT MAY BE MORE GENERAL PURPOSE TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF FIVE EXHIBITS. I'LL ALSO TURNED OVER TO MR OUT THERE TO- RESPOND. DIRECTOR WHO AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER STERN IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE INTENT TO CREATE PURPOSE MEANING THE ENTIRETY OF THE CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE THAT WAS THE APPROACH. THAT WE UNDERTOOK LAST YEAR AND FOR ALL THE OBVIOUS REASONS DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO ENGAGE SO MUCH WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DESIGN OF THAT IN THE DETAILS BUT IT IS THE INTERNET AND WE THINK WE% CAN GET THERE BY BUILDING UP FROM BEST. BUY LEVEL TEST IN SPECIFIC SECTORS BUT WE DO HAVE A VIEW OF WHERE CAPITAL NEEDS TO FLOW FOR THE BROADER MARKET WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT INBOUND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT ACROSS WHAT I THINK WE- WOULD CONSIDER THE ENTIRE CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA. BOB AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE ACTUALLY THE CENTERS PART QUESTION NOT GENERATION THIS IS PAIRED WITH FUNCTIONALITY AT GOBIZ BY WHICH THOSE TWO CRITICAL THINGS THE FUNDS SO THAT I MAY BUT THE CATALYST PROGRAM HAS TWO COMPONENTS THAT GO IS. ONE OF WHICH IS THE DEEP SECTOR UNDERSTANDING THAT IS REQUIRED TO KNOW WHERE THESE CAPITAL GAPS ARE WHERE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS CHALLENGING WHERE WE MIGHT LEVERAGE OTHER PARTNERSHIPS- AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE MARKETING BARRIERS ARE PARTICULAR. ISSUES VIDAK IN THE FOR SECTOR AND OTHER PIECES GOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION ALL THE STATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS BIGELOW RELATIONSHIP STATE FEDERAL AND WISELY POINTED OUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE OPTIMIZING FOR THAT AND CRITICALLY ALLOCATING PUBLIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT BY THE CAPITAL AND PUBLIC CAPITAL FORMATION. SO THIS IS THIS IS ABSOLUTELYINTENDED TO ACHIEVE THAT KIND OF SCALE WE'RE LOOKING AT PROCESSES LIKE THIS COPING PLAN FOR SIGNALS ABOUT WHERE. THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE PRIORITIES LIE. AND IT IS FUN CAN SCALE TO ACHIEVE THAT BUILDING FROM THIS TARGETED SET OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE UP FRONT OF US NOW. BASED ON THE AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS IN THESE TWO INITIAL SEX. THANK FOR THAT INSIGHT I INCLUDING A JUST I WOULD OUT SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS A PERHAPS SHOULD BE USED WHEN WE THINK THE ROOF- RECOMMENDATION THAT ELIO. NOT TO THINK OF REPORT BACK ON THE PILOTS BUT- HI I'D LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING. LIKE SIR PROACTIVE LOOKING IS U. S. AS YOU SAY ASSESS INBOUND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES OR SS THE FEDERAL LANDSCAPE. SOME KIND OF SCOPING OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE WITH AN ANTICIPATED FEDERAL INJECTION OF REVENUE AND COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND PRESENT US WITH SOME KIND OF REPORT OR ANALYSIS THAT THEN. WE COULD THEN BRING IN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE MORE OF A COHESIVE PLANNING PROCESS SO THAT YOU KNOW WE KIND OF GET OUR HEADS AROUND OKAY WE'RE GONNA SPEND SAY A HUNDRED MILLION NOW. BUT THEN. YOU KNOW TEN BILLIONS COMING BY AUGUST WILL THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT LOOKING CLIMATE CATALYST THEN. YOU KNOW TO PILOT PROGRAM SO I THINK PROACTIVE REPORTING ANALYSIS WOULD BE USEFUL SOMEONE FOR THE CHAIR TO CONSIDER THAT'S A OOD POINT SINCE WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER THAT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR COPAYS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TO GET BACK TO CENTER. MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE A CASCADE NO TIME IS LIMITED AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN BUT I WANTED TO ONCE AGAIN JUST BRING UP THE ISSU. OF SMALL FAMILY DAIRY FARMERS BACK IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THIS LEGISLATURE THEN GOVERNOR PROVIDED NINETY NINE MILLION- DURING. THE ADMINISTRATION THIS ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO MATH AT FROM MANURE MANAGEMENT TWENTY ONE NINE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR NOTHING. NOTHING NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAYS WE GOT THIS GREAT NEW WAYS BEING PROGRAM A FIFTY MILLION THAT AS ADDITIONAL. OUTLETS FOR FUNDING BESIDES HIS MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THIS STATE PROMISED. SMALL FAMILY DAIRY FARMERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM TRANSITION TO BE ABLE TO BE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL IT CANDIDLY LIKE THIS IS THE BEST NEW THING FOR THEM. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE DOZENS OF JERRY'S. FAMILY OWNED DAIRIES IN THE STATE. GO OUT OF BUSINESS EVERY YEAR. AND NOW ARE YOU. IN ALL DID CONSULT WITH GARY FARMERS ESPECIALLY ON THE NORTH COAST- THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THEM THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR THEM. THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR LARGER DAIRIES ARE FEEDLOTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT SADLY IN EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED HEAD DAIRY A FIVE HUNDRED HEAD DAIRY WITH ADDITIONAL. DEBT ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MARKET IS SO VOLATILE- IS LUDICROUS AND WHAT I WOULD HOPE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS. IN THE NEGOTIATIONS AND PROVIDE FIRM DOLLARS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES FOR THESE ORGANIC DAIRIES ON THE NORTH THAT HAVE CHALLENGES WITH. A MANURE MANAGEMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING- AND PROVIDE THEM WITH ACTUAL GRANT FUNDING AS WAS PROMISED WITH A LOWER BILL WAS PASSED. AND ONLY PASSION ABOUT IT BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING AND CANDIDLY BIT TONE DEAF. THANK YOU THANK YOU GENTLEMEN WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE NUMBER TEN AND MOVE ON TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE- SECRETARY ROSS. AND UNDER SECRETARY MOFFETT THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN FAIRGROUNDS OPERATIONS SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SOME OF US MAY HAVE HEARD FROM OUR COUNTY FAIRS BETTER APPARENTLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR GOOD MORNING SENATORS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY YES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS AS WELL AS TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT IS OPEN TO ALL FARES- EVERYONE KNOWS HOW DESTRUCTIVE THAT TWENTY TWENTY WAS FOR THE OPERATION OF MASSIVE DANCE. AND THE SUDDEN NEED TO SHUT DOWN ALL ACTIVITIES. AT FAIR GROUNDS AS GATHERING PLACES HOWEVER THEY NEEDED TO MAINTAIN STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS TO BE AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCIES AND UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE EMERGENCY NEEDS FOR THE USE OF THESE PUBLIC ASSETS- DURING CULTIVATE ACTED AS- THE- SHELTERS. FOODBANK DISTRIBUTION TESTING SITES AS AND VACCINATION SITES WILDFIRES AND EVACUATIONS- AND FOR THEIR AND- AS AS THE HIGH TEMPERATURE DAYS AND THE POWER SHUT DOWNS THAT ALSO REQUIRED THEM TO SERVE AS COOLING CENTERS. STATE AFFILIATED PLAYERS OPERATE BY STATUTEAS A STATE ENTITY AND ULTIMATELY THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS BECOME OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE AND THAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE FUNDS GOING TO. ONLY STATE AFFILIATED PLAYERS FOR OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT WILL MITIGATE THE LONG TERM LIABILITY- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME- FLEXIBILITY AS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND QUITE AS QUICKLY- WHEN UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD TO DO WAY OFF LIKE THEY DID IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S A SIX TO EIGHT MONTH PROCESS TO DO THAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE PROCUREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE. FIFTY THREE OF THE SEVENTY SEVEN PLAYERS IN THE STATE OUR STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS FORTY TWO OF THOSE INCLUDING CAL EXPO ARE ON STATE OWNED ASSETS. OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WELL AS THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT. OF HEALTH OF THOSE POSH. COULD BE USED. FOR ADDITIONAL USES THAT COULD GENERATE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS FOR THE FAIREST. OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR- I'M GOING GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE RUNNING THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO HELP COVER IMMEDIATE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS WITH REGARD TO THE MOST URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. OF THE FARES- LIKE MANY OF- ARE. LOOKING MOST OF THEM ARE AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS ALL. WITH SMALL TO FACILITY THINGS LIKE STATE. OF HEALTH AND SAY AND ELECTRICAL WIRING- PAID. AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AND WITH THAT I'D. SOMEBODY'S MOVING- MIKE I GUESS- WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE L. L. THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION THAT WE HAD THIS LAST YEAR WE TOOK THIS EMERGENCY ACTION TO HELP THE STATE OF PHILLY AFFAIRS COVERED THEIR- WIND DOWN OF COMMITMENTS THAT THEY HAD IN THEIR CONTRACT FOR PAYROLL AND ALL THAT STUFF STAFF REPORT SAYS IT ONLY HALF OF IT WAS USE. THAT WE'RE COMING BACK WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- REQUEST BECAUSE WE'RE ONE OF THE SOME OF THIS MONEY COULD BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN HELP WITH THE KOBE PANDEMIC CAN BE ASIDE FOR VACCINATIONS AND ALL THAT WELL A LOT OF COUNTY FEARS OF DOING THAT NO I COUNTY FEARS THAT AREN'T. INCLUDED IN THIS FUNDING REQUEST ON THEIR OWN NICOLE ARE VACCINATING PEOPLE ARE TESTING PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING FOOD THIS DISTRIBUTION AND SINCE LAST YEAR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WAS AN EMERGENCY BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER CONTRACT WE'VE LET THOSE PEOPLE GO FOR BETTER FOR WORSE I'M NOT I'M NOT FORGET IT GET INTO THAT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY WORK NOBODY KNOWS IF THIS IS A COUNTY AFFILIATE A FAIR OR STATE PHILLY AFFAIR WHEN THEY GO IN TO GET THEIR COVERT TESTS AND YES THEY ALL NEED THE ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT TYPE OF WORK SO I KNOW WE HAVE ELIO HAD SOME COMMENTS. AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STATE AFFILIATE AFFAIRS UNTIL THE MAY REVISION- WE FIND THAT PROVIDING OPERATIONAL SUPPORT IS REASONABLE SINCE FARES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONDUCT FORMAL REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES TO THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ASSUME THAT THERE'S WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT NORMAL OPERATIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR- WE FIND THAT THERE'S STILL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THIS GIVEN THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES MIGHT BE UPDATED AS MORE PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED ACROSS THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT DELAYING ACTION ON THIS ITEM BUT A LOT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO USE THE ADDITIONAL TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE DECISION. ON THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO PROVIDE- IMAGE IS ALSO IN. THAT HALF OF OPERATOR. SUPPORT FUNDING- WILL BE TARGETED BASED ON FINANCIAL MEANS OF THE STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS. THE FOR THIS PORTION OF THE FUNDING WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE- JAIL B. C. PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THESE BONDS- THAT'S BECAUSE- THE FARES OUR- DEPARTMENT WILL LIKELY UPDATE- HOW THIS. MONEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AS MORE INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF THE FAIR'S BECOMES AVAILABLE- THIS NOTIFICATION SHOULD INCLUDE DETAILS ON THE AMOUNT PROVIDED TO EACH DATA DELAYED THERE- THE METHOD USED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOCATE FUNDING AND ANY REMAINING BALANCE AND THE DEPARTMENTS EXPECTED USE OF THAT BALANCE. AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE GIVEN THE- NEEDS ACROSS THE- AFFAIRS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE ROLE THAT THE BEARS PLAYED AND THE. STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE NETWORK. HELLO I'M DO YOU THE AND NOW FOR THE DEFERRED MAY WAS ALL NINE FARES SO IT'S CONCEIVED THAT SOME OF THE CITRUS FARES AT THE COUNTY FAIRS WOULD BE HIGH. ON THE ON THE NEED FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE VERSUS THE DEA'S THAT ARE AFRAID EXACTLY STATE AFFILIATED. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WITH THIS NEED FOR. YOU KNOW USING AS A FIX. OF STAGING AREA FOR FIRE OR USING FOR COVER RELIEF YOU HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW THOSE- COUNTY FAIRS WE AND THIS. THE WORLD OF FAIR. I'M WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT MORE THAN HAPPY TO THE CIRCLE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND CIRCLE BACK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE NEEDS OF COUNTY FAIRS AND CITRUS AFFAIRS- BUT I BELIEVE THAT QUESTION THEY MINISTRATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER AS WELL WE'LL GET TO THAT AFTER SENATE MCGUIRE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A SECURE QUESTIONING COMMENT AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE UNDER TIME LIMITS ALL BE QUICK- AND I-ALSO KNOW THAT- THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIRS TO BE ON HOLD OPEN AND I AGREE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION APPRECIATE THAT. MISTER OR CASKEY IS WELL. FIRST AND FOREMOST JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SECRETARY SECTOR ROSTER ALL OVER WORK AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU. I THINK THAT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT FAIRS WHETHER IT'S AND I GUESS SO SHE XIN. A STATE SPONSORED FAIR. INDOOR COUNTY FAIR THEY'VE ALL CRATERED IT CRATERED. FIVE OF THIS CODE- INDUCED RECESSION IN OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC OF EFFECTIVE CARE TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. IN WHAT WE ALSO KNOWN ESPECIALLY IN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. AT COUNTY FAIRS STATE FAIRS. THEY ARE MAIN DRIVERS FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES. IN MORE AND MORE IF WE ARE RELYING ON STATE FAIRS. COUNTY FAIRS AG ASSOCIATIONS TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE AT CRITICAL NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS IS ACROSS THE STATE. NGUYEN YES SETS UP- AN EVACUATION SHELTER. OR WIN A LOCAL COMMUNTY SET UP A BASE CAMP WITH CAL FIRE- IT'S NOT **** IS A STATE OWNED FACILITY- COUNTY ON DISABILITY. ALL FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO RIGHTFULLY SO TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THEIR DOORS. IN WHAT WE NOW IS THAT WE NEED FAIR'S FAIR GROUNDS MORE THAN EVER. AND WHAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS- THROUGH THE WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION THERE'S ALWAYS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WHAT WORKS FOR ONE WORKS FOR ALL. IN NOW WHAT THIS PROPOSALS FOCUSING ON ARE JUST STATE FAIRS IN AGRA SUFFICIENT. WE'RE LEAVING THE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE COUNTY FAIRS OUT OF IT. AND WE'RE GOING AWAY FROM THE FORMULA THAT IS ALWAYS WORKED IN AS BEEN TRIED AND TRUE. FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE AND THAT IS THE GREAT BILL. THAT TAKES A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT IS SOLD. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE WERE YEAR AND ARREARS ABOUT SEVEN MILLION COMING INTO THAT. UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE OPEN FOR ALL FEARS IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET ABOUT. WHAT FIGURES NEED. AND THERE'S A AT AUTOMATIC TO SIX SO IT'S JUST SAY WE'RE GOING CLOSE TO. IT'S JUST NOT. SO WHAT I WOULD HOPE- MY CASKET THIS COMES TO US- THAT THIS IS GOING BE OPEN UP TO ALL FARES. IN ONE MORE SPIN. RISK NINETY SIX BILLION RIGHTFULLY SO TO BE A HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND MOST OF. FOR ARGUING OVER FOR. MILLION ENSURING IT'S GONNA BE OPEN UP THE COUNTY FAIRS I THINK THAT WE CAN DO BETTER WITH HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE A TO SEE AN EXPANDED PACKAGE COMING BACK. WELL IT LOOKS IF THE MATHIS RIGHT WE HAVE TWENTY MILLION LEFT OVER FROM LAST YEAR CORRECT EMERGENCY OPERATION FOR CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS THEN WE HAVE TO FIFTY MILLION. THAT WE GET THIS TEN MILLION SORTS OF. THE WORKING NUMBER IS EIGHTY MILLION SECURE SPOT. VICE CHAIR DOLLARS. WHAT THE METHODOLOGY AND- THE- WHICH- SHARES ARE DISTRICT FAIR ARE THIRD OR. THE SENATE IT'S BASED ON THE GOVERNOR STRUCTURE. I SO IF IT'S A EIGHT EIGHT IT'S A STATE AND TO AND A POP AS A STATE AGENCY AND SO IT WAS ON THAT- AND THIS IS NOT IMPRESSED- AND PREVIOUS ALLOCATIONS LARGE BEARS- DID NOT RECEIVE THOSE ALLOCATIONS IT WAS BASED ON FINANCIAL NEED- AND SO THIS IS THIS IS BASED ON THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AS A WAY TO PRIORITIZE. A SPENDING. AND ULTIMATELY BECAUSE THE STATE ITSELF IS OBLIGATED AT THE BEARS CANNOT MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS WE HAVE A LIABILITY THERE IS THE STATE. SO ALL LISTED I WANT TO TACK ON THE CENTER REQUIRES COMMENTS THEY WHEN YOU SHOW UP TO THE WHEN THAT WHEN THERE'S A FIRE WHEN THERE'S A PANDEMIC WHEN YOU SHOW UP YOU DON'T THE KICK OUR CONSTITUENTS DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES WHICH IN THE FUNDING SHOULD BE. MORE DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY TO ALL THOSE. OKAY FINANCE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. I'VE EVER DEPARTED FINANCE I JUST- JUST MAKE A COUPLE POINTS TWO HUNDRED POINTS ALLIE- PROVIDED- YOU KNOW ACKNOWLEDGING THERE ARE STILL UNCERTAINTIES ON OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH WITH SPARES IN IN THE BUDGET YEAR I THINK OUR- THE FIFTY MILLION PROPOSED IS BASED OFF OF THE OF THE BEST ESTIMATE OF AVAILABLE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE- AND- COMMENT ON ON THE- THIRTY. DAY CAN. REQUIREMENT I THINK WE'LL JUST KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T REDUCE SOME OF THE STATE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MEDIA FAIR NEED I THINK ONE THING THAT WE EXPERIENCE THIS YEAR- WITH PROVIDING- FUNDING TO AFFAIRS IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF. YOU KNOW UNEXPECTED THING TO HAPPEN TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE NIMBLE AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AFFAIRS OF FUNDING IN A QUICK MANNER GIVEN THAT THEY ARE. WORKING ON TIGHT BUDGETS AND SO- YOU KNOW NOTIFICATION BEFORE. IT OF FUNDING TO OTHER AFFAIRS I THINK PROVIDES- KIND OF IT LIMITS TO THE STATE WHERE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ACT AS QUICKLY AS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE FARES. OKAY THANK WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS YOU KNOW IT'S I MEAN THERE'S ALL A LOT OF CLEVER THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF THERE'S- MILLION IN THE BANK. IF YOU HAD A FIVE MILLION YOU COULD PROBABLY GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS. EVERY COUNTY FAIR AND SEARCHES FOR AND JUST SAY THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET THIS YEAR BUT- WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING CLEVER THANK YOU. THE CHAIR NOTICES THAT WE'RE ALL HERE SO MISS ROY LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHY CASKEY HERE MY CASKEY HERE. CALLING YOUR CALLING HERE. REQUIRE YOUR REQUIRED. STERN YOUR- STERN HERE. EXCELLENT QUORUM MOVE ON THE ISSUE TWO IN THESE REGULAR. REPORTING FOR AGRICULTURE. SECRETARY RON GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR- BEFORE CALVET NINETEEN FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE FACING INCREASING NEW CHALLENGES INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WATER UNCERTAINTY- AND A NUMBER OF NEW REGULATIONS THAT PASSED IN THE LAST DECADE THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND ALL OF THOSE COME WITH SEPARATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- TWO YEARS AGO- WE HAD A SUMMER INTERN FROM THE HOSPITAL OF BUSINESS WHO MAPPED OUT- THE NUMBER OF REGULATIONS THAT FARMERS OF ALL SIZES MUST COMPLY WITH AND MAPPED OUT AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT REGULATIONS. ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES I KNOW THAT WHEN I GO OUT WITH THE GOVERNOR GOES OUT WHEN SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL GOES OUT WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THE REGULATORY BURDEN AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE AND COMPLEXITY ALL OF THE REPORTS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE AT DIFFERENT TIMES. MANY OF THEM HAVE SOME OF THE SAME REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING. AND AS WE LOOK AT RECOVERING FROM THE HUGE DISRUPTION TO MARKETS FOR FARMERS WE KNOW THAT THE LOSS OF FOOD SERVICE WHICH IS ABOUT 50% OF THE FOOD DOLLARS THAT ARE SPENT OUTSIDE OF THE HOME IN RESTAURANTS CAFETERIAS- SPORTING EVENTS WHATEVER IT IS. DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF OUR SMALL FARMERS WERE IMPACTED BY THAT THOSE PART OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS PROJECT WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT EPA THE JOINTLY MANAGE BY PROCESS IMPROVEMENT TO MAP OUT AND DOCUMENT THE REGULATIONS THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND ALIGN WHERE THOSE ARE BUT THERE MAY BE SOME DUPLICATIONS WERE WE COULD STREAMLINE OUR OPERATIONS. AND IN DOING THAT STREAMLINE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL SIZE FARMERS AND RANCHERS- AND IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MAKE LIFE A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES OF THE STATE- I THINK THAT FIGHT DOCUMENTING AND MAPPING. OUR SHARED REGULAR CHOI PATHWAY. AND I. THE ROOT BACKING- OF THAT SHRIMP THE ALLOW. WHEN THAT HAVE IS PROVIDE. AND WHERE THERE ARE TWO- WEEK COME WITH A GOOD PACKAGE EVERY FOR OUR FROM AND IN THE STATE OF. OPEN TO. ON THAT AND THEY'RE GONNA NUMBER OF CAMANCHE GROUP THAT. I'M DONE EVAN AND ASSESSED ON THAT'S THE STATE. SECTOR WAS THE MOST RECENT ONE THE ESTIMATED AT LEAST 7% OF THEIR OPERATING COSTS WERE JUST AROUND THE COMPLIANCE RECORDING COSTA STRAWBERRY PRODUCERS. AS ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT A SIGNIFICANT COST OF OPERATION- THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE. THANK YOU SECRETARY ROSS I KNOW THAT THE ALEJO- THIS IS GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE WITH THE STRAWBERRY FOLKS- YOU KNOW THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE BIG PICTURE IF YOU COULD GIVE US A FLAVOR BECAUSE I'VE MISTER JIMENEZ TO MISTER BROWN ARE WAITING FOR THE END IN THIS DUPLICATIVE. ASSESSMENT WHERE YOU THINK YOU GO TO TARGET WHERE YOU THINK IT'S MOST WILL AGREE JUST. YET SO- IN OUR PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WERE JUST STARTING TO US AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED SOME OUTSIDE EXPERTISE AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS ASSIST BOTH OF OUR AGENCIES- WE'VE HAD- VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- WITH THEIR IRRIGATED ADVANCED PROGRAM AND NOW THE CD SALTS. AND OTHERS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO PRIORITIZE AND THAT IS ONE AGENCIES VERY EAGER TO SIT DOWN WITH US AND DO THIS MAP APPS- TO SEE IF. A WAY TO TAKE A MORE IN. REPORTING APPROACH TO MULTIPLE PRO THAT ARE IMPACTING THE SAME ACRES OF LAND AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT I CAN PROVIDE TODAY. OKAY ALEJO. ARM YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON THIS. MISTER YES. THAT THEIR COMMENDED WHAT THE BUDGET ANALYST'S OFFICE SORRY FOR- THE FOR THE RED. WERE A- AT WE DID. THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSED- TO. AN SS OF THE- PARKWAY. THAT ARE PLACE ON AG INDUSTRY. FOLLOWING FOUND THAT AN SS. OF THAT NATURE DOES HAVE MERIT ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROVIDE US WITH A COMPELLING LIST OF DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT INTENDS TO ASSESS. I'M HAVING THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES CONFIDENCE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT PROBLEM DOES EXIST AND THAT. FUNDING WILL BE- WELL TARGETED. THE MORE HAN HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WHICH DEPARTMENT SEE WHAT INFORMATION THEY CAN PROVIDE US AND REPORT BACK TO THEM. YOU MAY AS WELL- ALSO PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT OF. ONLINE OF THEIR ONLINE PORTAL- WE DID RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED APARTMENTS REPORT AT THAT BUDGET HEARING ON. WHAT OTHER FUND SOURCES COULD BE USE BESIDES GENERAL FUND. AND WE FIND THAT- CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ONLINE PORTAL. DOES HAVE MERIT GIVEN THAT- THE DEPARTMENT IS- INDICATED THAT IS. BURDEN SOME TECHNICAL INDUSTRY AND- A PORTAL SUCH AS THIS WOULD- THE DEPARTMENT ITS NEXT STEPS. WHAT IT CAN DO TO CORRECT ISSUE AND PROVIDE A MORE CONVENIENT SERVICE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT THE- I'M ASSESSMENT LARGELY. AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND DOESN'T- HAVE A BROAD ENOUGH A BENEFIT- WARRANT OFFICER THE GENERAL FUND ON. MISTER CHAIR I HOPE. THAT I NOT- PROVIDING. ON THAT- JUST IN YEARS AND DOING OUR EIGHTY- IS EIGHTY THIRTY COME. YOU TO THE STATURE DEADLINE UNDER WHICH WE TO MEET WE WERE A- TO DO IT INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT- AND SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT INFORMATION ABOUT JUST LICENSING IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT TWO THOUSAND DIFFERENT WEB PAGES. AT CDFA- FEW OF THEM IN PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION PROVIDE A WAY TO APPLY ONLINE. AND SO WE FEEL THAT DURING THIS. US HE PULLED ISN'T. TOGETHER IS THE FIRST STEP THAT WE COULD DO THAT WOULD IMPROVE OUR SERVICE HAS GOVERNMENT. TO OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND THEN MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED BUT CHEWING THIS PERSON'S BASELINE- ASSESSMENT ARCHITECTURE UP FOR THAT ALL IS HOW WE PULL THAT THE ENGINE CRUISER. THE FARMERS RANCHERS I CAN'T THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF FOR SMALL FARMERS IN PARTICULAR THEY DO NOT HAVE. YOU KNOW A SPECIALIST ON STAFF AND MORE AND MORE OF EVEN THAT SIZE FARMERS ARE HAVING TO HIRE A FULL TIME PERSON IF YOU COMPLIANCE REPORTING AND KEEP UP. WITH REQUIREMENTS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES THAT THEY INTERFACE WITH. SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP THAT FOR US TO DO THAT ARCHITECTURAL LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT. AND THEN MAKE PROPOSALS AND HOW THE FUND THE NEXT ACCESS BACK THANK YOU FOR THE CLERK. LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF THOSE SPOTS SMALL FARMERS VICE CHAIR DOLLARS. OF MY GOSH DO I START- YOUR PERSONAL I'M I. AS A FORMER. WHO DEALS WITH GROUNDWATER REGULATION. SERVICE WATER REGULATIONS. TOXICS COUNTY AG DEPARTMENT IN WE ARE WE ARE TRUE FARM I'M THIS ANYWAY DOLLY IN THE OTHER HOUSE DOES ALL THAT STUFF I RUN THE TRACTOR. AND I WILL TELL YOU. THAT WE ARE. CONSTANTLY IN FEAR FIRST OF ALL OF TIME TO GET IT RIGHT NUMBER ONE AND I ALL ALL FOR STREAM THE PROCESS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU. THE DOUBLES AND DETAILS. WE DO ISSUE NUMBER ONE THAT WE- UP TODAY IS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY TO STREAM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO PESTICIDES. AND YOU KNOW WE STARTED OUT AT% SEVEN MILLION AND NOW IT'S TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION. AND WE'RE NOT THERE- THERE ARE SO MANY IT PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT THAT I CAN DO IN ORDER START SO I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL OF HOW IT HAPPENS BECAUSE- I'M ALL FOR IT. I WANT I WANT TO GO ONLINE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE ROUTE I MEAN WE HAVE. DIVERGENT WATER DIVERSIONS OF REALLY SMALL AMOUNTS THAT IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE. DON'T EVEN HAVE CELL SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO DO REAL TIME SO YOU GOT TO SEND SOMEBODY OUT THERE TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WATER IS GOING THROUGH A PIPE. SO I AGREE WITH THE- THE TOO MUCH. GOVERNMENT INTEREST INTRUSION INTO INTO FAMILY FARMS AND SMALL FARMS. BUT I WANNA KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO BE. IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE'RE GONNA PUT. YOU KNOW A COUPLE MILLION NOW TO GET STARTED AND THEN. TENS OF MILLIONS AND WE STILL DON'T GET THERE I MEAN THESE DEPARTMENTS DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER THERE'S- RATED. REGULATIONS ON TOP REGULATIONS ON TOP REGULATION SO- I NEED MORE DETAIL ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO. MAKE IT EASIER FOR ME TO STAY. A FAMILY FARM IN CALIFORNIA. HEY THAT'S WILL LEAVE THAT AT THAT AND- WE'RE GONNA HOLD OFF ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE AND LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SWEET PROGRAM. YES SIGNATURE ROSE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMME IT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR MOST OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAMS- FOR THE PAST- SEVEN YEARS WE'VE FUNDED EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS COVERING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES- WITH AN INVESTMENT OF EIGHTY. POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DATE THAT'S ALSO BEEN MATCHED BY THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR OWN INVESTMENT. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS WEEK PROGRAMS RESULTED IN EIGHTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO REDUCTIONS IN ADDITION TO THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION GALLONS OF WATER STATE ANNUALLY- THE BUDGET REQUEST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY% TWO THE FUNDS ADDITIONAL PROJECTS UNDER THIS VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM ESPECIALLY BURKE AND THE OTHER EXTREMELY TRIED HERE- THE QUESTION WAS RAISED BY ALEJO ABOUT. THE NEED FOR EARLY ACTION ON THIS OF THIS JUST ALLOWS US TO CAT BIG CONTRACTS AWARDED EARLIER TO START THIS WATER SAVINGS EARLIER IF WE WERE TO GET THE FUNDING AS SOON AS IT'S AVAILABLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT OUT THE REQUEST FOR GRANT PROPOSALS. AND AWARD THOSE CONTRACTS SO THAT THE WORK COULD BE DONE YET IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS OPPOSED TO WAITING FOR THE NEXT YEAR BUT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS. ON THE GROUND AND IMPLEMENTING. THE WATER AND ENERGY SAVINGS. THANK YOU A. O. WHAT IT WHAT DO THINK THINK ABOUT THAT EXTRA OF WHY WE SHOULD LET HALF THE MONEY OUT EARLY. I'M YEAH WE- AGREE THAT THIS PURPOSE ALIGNS WITH PAST LET. PRIORITIES AND REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AND SUSTAINABILITY MANAGING WATER RESOURCES. ARE WE STILL RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED- THE PROPOSAL TO BE FOUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR- JUST TO REDUCE- INITIATIVE COMPLEXITY IN AWARDING TWO GRANTS AND TWO CYCLES. AND BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S TIMELINE- I BELIEVE GRANTS WITH. BUT WOULD BE AWARDED AND COVER IT TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO- THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY IMMEDIATE FUNDING BEING PROVIDED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. THREE I'M JUST WONDERING WE JUST DID VOTED ON A NINE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR- IMMEDIATE. APPROPRIATION I WONDER HOW COMPLEX IT HAS IT'S GOING TO BE WITH DOING THESE- OTHER ONES CENTER STERN YOU HAVE A COMMENT. IT USED TO THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH IS I MEAN. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND- ANTICIPATED COMPLEX BUT- WE'RE BROKEN RIGHT NOW IS IN A CON. THAT SPEED IS GOING TO BE OUR FRIEND SO I I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM. CDFA I MEAN I FEEL IT'S A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF URGENCY AROUND EARLY ACTION THAT I APPRECIATE. WE IS THE LEGISLATURE TO WANT TO HAVE. FOR SIDE IN TIME AND DRIVEN MINISTRY TO PROCESS BUT IF. YOU KNOW IF WE NEED TO GET. FARMERS BACK ON THEIR FEET OR PREPARE FOR THIS DROUGHT SEASON RIGHT NOW I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT THAT CLOCK IS TICKING. AND SIGMA'S HITTING. N. THE GREAT THE GROUNDWATER YOU KNOW ASSESSMENT PLANS THE GSA'S ARE COMING IN AND THERE'S GOING TO BE  LOT OF TENSION IN THE LAWSUITS HAVE ALREADY STARTED. AND IF THERE'S SOME WAY. TO MITIGATE THAT TENSION RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TRAIN WRECK. AT THE END OF THIS SUMMER ACT I SAY GO SO I JUST I WANT TO HEAR THAT. I MEAN CAN YOU SOLVE THAT IT MINISTRY TO COMPLEXITY ISSUE SECRETARY ROSS- I MEAN LIKE HOW I'D LOVE TO HEAR. A RESPONSE ON THAT JUST BECAUSE- WE HAVE DEBATED THIS THOROUGHLY BECAUSE THIS INVOLVES NOT ONLY OUR OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL. FARMING AND INFORMATION IT ALSO INVOLVES OUR GRANTS OFFICE. AS WELL AS OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BECAUSE OF THAT THE SCOUT APPLICATION SO BASS BOTH ALL TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. TO ENTER INTO THE SYSTEM AND WHILE IT DOESN'T IMPROVE. WHO'S THE COMPLEXITY. WE ARE PREPARED% TO MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS. WE HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT WE COULD HAVE CONTRACTS- IN PLACE- SO THAT THE WORK IT ACTUALLY BEGAN. ON LATE OCTOBER EARLY NOVEMBER I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVERLY OPTIMISTIC. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET IT DONE BEFORE WE HOPE THE RAINS COME LATER IN THE WINTER TIME. AND THAT PUTS PROJECTS ON THE GROUND. JUST START SOME OF THESE WILL BENEFIT FROM YOU KNOW IF WE HAD A WET WINTER FROM RECHARGE AND BEING ABLE TO. START THAT WORK SO. OUR STAFF IS VERY DEDICATED WE WORK WELL ACROSS OUR VARIOUS DIVISIONS TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS WORK IN AN INTEGRATED KIND OF WAY AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE GET THE WORK. IN THE GROUND BEFORE. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU GUYS PRESSURE DAHLE. I JUST COMMENT LET THE BETTER END OF THE DAY THERE'S APPLICANTS OUT THERE FOR THE THERE ARE YOU READY GO THEY JUST NEED RESOURCES TO GO. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE GOOD TO HOLD THAT. AND YOU BOTH FOR BACK TO STAFF ON- THE FOLLOW UPS NOW LET'S. TALK ABOUT MICROGRAMS FOR UNDERSERVED. POPULATIONS AND OF ON THE FARM PLUS ALSO SMALL AND EVEN HI EVEN MEDIUM SIZE FARMS. SECRETARY ROSS YES THIS IS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR UNDERSERVED FARMS WERE VERY. EXCITED AND GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET THIS SPECIFIC ASSISTANCE- FOR SMALL AND UNDERSERVED FARMS IT'S A TOTAL OF SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. A THREE POINT THREE FIVE AND IN EARLY ACTION AND- AT THE NATIONAL POINT THREE FIVE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. 20% OF CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS ARE IN THE CATEGORY OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGE WHICH IS THAT AT A DESIGNATION UNDER THE FARM BILL AND- THE USDA CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE. IT'S A GROWING NUMBER OF SMALL FARM BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAVE UNIQUE CHALLENGES. THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE UNDER RESOURCE THEY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY FACE LANGUAGE OF EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS. MARKETING THEIR CROPS- AND THEY DON'T HAVE LONG TERM ACCESS TO LAND. ON MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE FORMER EQUITY ACT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE LEGISLATURE EARLY IN TWENTY TWENTY AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FORMER EQUITY ACT- THAT WAS PASSED- SO. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SHARED BY ALL FROM FARM AND BECOME HAS. AS OF ECONOMIC WEEK. NINE OF THE JUST. HEAD THE PAYCHECK BY LOSS OF RESTAURANTS. I'M SOMEWHERE IMPACT BY FAR MARKET. MANY WERE NOT ABLE TO HAVE IT TOO ONLINE SALE DIRECTLY TO COST- THAT THEY NEED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GO THROUGH THE MAZE OF THAT. WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE FEEDBACK WE'VE GOTTEN FROM OUR LISTENING SESSIONS WITH SMALL FARMERS IN THE CBO'S THAT SERVE UNDER RESOURCE FARMERS. BUT MANY OF THEM WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS USDA ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED. I'M THOSE ARE VERY COMPLEX. PROCESSES AND YOU ARE VERY VERY SMALL FARMERS AND UNDER RESOURCE FARMERS WERE ABLE TO TAP INTO THAT. SO A BIG EMPHASIS ON THIS IS EQUIPPING THE CBO COMMUNITY AND YOU SEE ACTING NATIONAL RESOURCES COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. SMALL FARM ADVISORS SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER THAT HANDS ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO HELP THE SMALL DISADVANTAGED FARMERS TAP INTO ANY RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT USDA THE PACKAGE THAT PASSED AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. HAS CONSIDERABLE DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DEVELOPER GRANT PROGRAMS. BUT WE'RE VERY ANXIOUS TO GET EARLY ACTION ON THE US TO SUPPORT THE SMALL FARMERS AND BEING ABLE TO. ACCESS THOSE FUNDS INTO IN ADDITION TO ANY RELIEF DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FOCUS OFFICE- WHAT WE SPECIFICALLY PROPOSED ON BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS A QUESTION FROM THE L. A. O. YES MORE SPECIFICS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO A NUMBER OF LISTENING SESSION SINCE THIS PROPOSAL WAS MADE IN JANUARY. SO FOR THE EARLY ACTION WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT THREE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IN ADDITION TO OUR STAFF ASSISTANT. JUNIOR DOLLARS FOR GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP AS MANY CBO THAT. SOME ARE NEW IN THE LAST DECADE THEY'RE OFFERING LOW THE- AND CULTURE APPROPRIATE ASSIST TO THE SMALL FOR THAT HAVE. BUT A GROUP CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT OUR WILL. THIS WILL BE A GREAT COOK. IF THE CLIP OVER TO YOUR CARRIER HELP FARMERS. SPECIFICALLY TO TAP IN THOSE BY ALL- DOLLAR AND THEN HUNDRED DOLLAR FOR MY GRANTS THE FARM. AND THE NEXT YEAR IT WOULD BE ONE POINT THREE FIVE DOLLAR. THROUGH YOU SEE SMALL. AND BY. AS WELL AS THAT WOULD BE FOR TWO TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND ONE POINT THREE FIVE NINE DOLLARS FOR SECOND IS THIS. FOR TWENTY THREE TWENTY. AND SIX AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR MY- FOR FARMERS- AND THEN AS YEAR. AVAILABLE. FOR THANK YOU SECRETARY ARE RIGHTS. CALIO YOU GARGLE BREAK COUNTY. IS THAT ANSWER THE BECAUSE ABOUT THEIR EARLY MONEY FOR GRANT SINCE GRANT. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AT. OWN SKETCH DOESN'T GO UP UNTIL OCTOBER. TO HIM MANIS. DO I HAVE THE RIGHT I'M SORRY MR WASN'T WAS HAVE TROUBLE AND MY- NO GO AHEAD. YES THE INTENT OF THE ROLE OF THE NOT RAY ANY CAN WITH OUR OFFICE HOWEVER DO- THREE THAT ARE IN THE OF THAT WE CAN WOULD PROVIDE THE LET- BUT- HE PIECE OF INFORMATION IN ASSESSING THE TWO GRANTS BEING PROPOSED. ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS RELATES TO THEM THE RECENT FEDERALLY FACT IT CHEN THE GRANTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THERE MAY BE SOME DUPLICATIVE EFFORTS THERE- HOW THE DEPARTMENT DEFINED SMALL MID SIZE FARMERS USING THE USDA DEFINITION OF SMALL AND MID SIZE THAT. COMPASSES AROUND 85% OF THE FARMS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE FIND THAT THAT MADE ME MAKE- FUNDING HARD TO TARGET AND THEN- SECTOR US- PROVIDE INFORMATION HOUSING MONEY WILL BE SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO GRAND. AND THEN WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVE ANY FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M EARLY ACTION IS LIKELY NOT WARRANTED GIVEN THAT FUNDING WILL BE IS WILL NOT BE USED TO SUPPORT IMMEDIATE SERVICES IN THE CURRENT YEAR. YOU MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE EARLY ACTION TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE OUT REACH FOR THESE. MICRO FOLKS VERSUS THE ACTUAL FUNDING OF THE GRANT. IS BLACK DOES IT SEEM CONCEIVABLE TO YOU THAT THAT SOME OF THIS WORK COULD BE DONE IF THEY GOT THE PCP WITH IT THAT SOMEBODY PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY. GO OUT IN THE COMMUNITY OR DO WHATEVER. ONE DOES THE CONTACT THESE UNDERSERVED FARMERS. I SEE THAT IS A DIFFERENT FUNCTION THAT ACTUALLY. YOUR PROOF FOR THE GREAT BECAUSE THEY CAN CONSIDER THE GRANT RIGHT THIS IS START THE APPLICATION PROCESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I SPEAK TO THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE- OF EARLY. IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GO THROUGH YOU SEE COOPERATIVE. SMALL FARM ADVISORS AND THE CV I WAS. AT WORK WITH MANY OF THE SMALL SIT DOWN FARMERS. THAT THEY ARE TO DO THAT. ON TECH THIS SPECIFICALLY. TO HELP THE SMALL FARMERS TAP INTO FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR GRANT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS ANY PROGRAMS AT THE STATE HOUSE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. I ALSO AND I APOLOGIZE THAT I NEGLECTED. TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION ABOUT. DEFINITION OF SMALL FARM. HELLO DOES HAVE SMALL FARMS THEN- ACROSS YOU THAT STATES. BUT WE PROPOSE. AFTER LISTENING SESSIONS AND WE WILL DO ADDITIONAL LISTENING SESSIONS. TO MODIFY THE USDA DEFINITION OF SMALL FARMS TO ONE HUNDRED ACRES FOR THE LAST- THAT MAY BE REFINED A BIT MORE BUT THAT IS OUR INTENT. OR GOING OUT TO AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF LISTENING SESSIONS BEFORE WE PUT THAT. THE FINAL GRANT STAFF TOGETHER FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM BUT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT'S THE PIECE THE BEST THAT WE FEEL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET FUNDED YEAH IN THIS. CURRENT YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU ALRIGHT LET'S CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THAT'S WHAT'S WILL MOVE ON TO OUR LAST ISSUE IN PART A- WHICH GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING WITH THE ALEJO'S. HI ANALYSIS OF THE TWO THIRDS VOTE IS NECESSARY FOR THE- THE MILL IF IT WASN'T ALREADY AN INTERESTING. TOPIC THIS IS THE TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. AND THE SECRETARY. ROSS YOUR JOB JUST GOT TOUGH. EVERY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE TERM AND I THINK I WAS GOING TO PRESENT THIS ITEM OKAY I APOLOGIZE. AND I AND THE JOB JUST YET OUT TOP BUT I'M A PART WITH THAT THE HAS REGULATION INVEST THANK YOU MISTER. FIVE I'M SORRY I SHOULD GOTTEN THAT GO AHEAD MISTER GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN HOUSE AND OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THANKS HAVING HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS ALL SENIOR I'M THE TO. OF THE TO OF PASSED REGULATION AT PA. IF I'M I'D LIKE TO START STATION WITH JUST A STATE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU. OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WILL FOCUS ON OUR VCP TO REQUEST SUPPORT TOO FOR THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. THE GUY BUDGET PROPOSES TO REPLACE THE CURRENT BLACK FEMALE ASSESSMENT ON PESTICIDE SALES. WITH A RISK BASED HERE NO ASSESSMENT. WHERE HIGHER TOXICITY PESTICIDES ARE ASSESSED A HIGHER FEE. AND WE BELIEVE THE TRANSITIONING FROM A BLACK MALE TO A TIERED MILL WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT MARKET SIGNAL. WHERE WE WANT TO GO AS A STATE REGARDING PESTICIDE USAGE. ONCE FULLY PHASED IN BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WE WANT TO GIVE ADEQUATE TIME FOR BILL PAYERS TO ADJUST. TO THE NEW TIERED MAIL THIS BOLD AND INNOVATIVE APPROACH IS ANTICIPATED TO GENERATE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. TO THE DVR FRONT. THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL FUND VARIOUS DPR AND CDFA PROGRAMS. WILL ALSO INCREASE OUR SUPPORT TO COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS FOR LOCAL PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. AND WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH PESTICIDE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE STATE'S TRANSITION FROM HARMFUL PESTICIDES TO MORE SUSTAINABLE TOOLS. WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT DPR AND OUR SISTER AGENCIES CERTAINLY INCLUDING CDFA. ARE DEEPLY ENGAGED A GREAT INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. FROM ASSISTANCE TO CHILDCARE CENTERS ANDSCHOOLS TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GROWERS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK READ THAT WILL COMMENCE ITS ACTIVITIES IN A FEW WEEKS AND REVIEW THESE ISSUES IN MUCH GREATER DETAIL OF. ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. BUT THE REALLY GOOD NEWS THE GREAT NEWS I THINK IS THE CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND BACKYARD GARDENERS AND OPEN SPACE MANAGERS AND MANY OTHERS. HAVE BEEN UTILIZING INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY. ON THIS TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE IN STORE VERY GOOD SECRETARY. ROSS DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO. ADD ON YOUR SITE THE LEDGER. HE OF THE ONLY THING I'D LIKE TO MISTER BECAUSE THAT- IN ORDER TO DO THIS THERE IS A GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE NEED FOR MINUTES ON THE GROUND. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN DOING THIS. IT IS A MATTER OF ADDITIONAL RESEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVES AND HAVING PEOPLE IN THE FIELD TRUSTED SOURCES FROM COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. DOING FIELD TRIALS HOLDING DEMONSTRATION DAYS PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS RANCHERS AND THE PAST CONTROL ADVISORS. WE ALSO INCLUDE AS PART OF THAT GRANT FUNDING THAT WOULD. WOULD COME ABOUT FROM THESE FUNDS- THE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH IS PART OF THE CSU SYSTEM. THE CSU SYSTEM- THROUGH ITS VARIOUS COLLEGES THAT HAVE AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS- HAVE BECOME ON THE TRAINING GROUND FOR MANY OF OUR PEST CONTROL ADVISORS IN ADDITION. TO YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR WHO DO THIS FOR THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THEY GO ON TO WORK FOR. THANK YOU. I NOTICED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST IS ASKING FOR FORTY FOUR POSITIONS FOR DPR BUT NO POSITIONS FOR- THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. TO DO THIS- COMPREHENSIVE TRANSITION TO SAFETY IS THAT IS THAT. JUST GONNA BE OBSERVABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT'S A- BASED ON- CRY STATE AT OFFICE OF AND BY FARMING AND IF. AND OFF HAS CON. AND NOW- WE ANTI TO RUN THE- THROUGH. AND MAKE AS A AS TO GET THE DOLLARS WORK. AS THE VISION AS- AND STILL DIRECT THEM IN A WAY THAT ALIGNS WITH STATE POLICY BILLS. OKAY FIVE THANK YOU. FIVE- BELIAU YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS. I'M MISTER FRENCH MAN IS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT WAS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL THAT MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THIS WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE I'M PRIOR TO GOING INTO MY ARM ASSESSMENT- BUT OVERALL WE FIND THAT ADJUSTING THE MOLASSES MAN IS WARRANTED GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL FINE- IS THE DPR FONG. WE FIND THAT ESTABLISHING A TIERED BELL ASSESSMENT THAT PLACES A HIGHER CHARGE ON MORE TOXIC PESTICIDE IS REASONABLE AND COULD ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE USE- WE ALSO FINE. THAT THE SPENDING. PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR'S REASONABLE GIVEN THAT IT LARGELY ASSIST THE STATE IN REDUCING PESTICIDE USAGE. AND EXPAND THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN UPHOLDING PESTICIDE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HAVE A RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE BASIN ANY TOURNAMENT ASSESSMENT AND ONE OR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THE FOUR YEARS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. FIND AT A FOR YOUR FACE AND IS- QUITE LONG ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT AS THE FACE AN WOULD REDUCE SHORT TERM COST THE BUYERS AND SELLERS OF PESTICIDES. IT DOES HAVE SOME NOTABLE DRAWBACKS- ONE AND POTENTIALLY A WEEKENDS THE MARKET SIGNALED THAT THE PROPOSAL'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE BY SPREADING OUT- THE RATE INCREASES OVER FOUR YEARS. AND THEN IT GENERATES A SMALL AMOUNT OF REVENUES EARLY ON WHICH REQUIRES SOME GENERAL FUND TO COVER PROPOSED SPENDING- AND ARE. WE PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE BASIN SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT USES THE SAME RATE. BUT ARE IMPLEMENTED A ONE OR ONE OR TWO YEARS AND WE THINK THAT PROVIDES- FLEXIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO PROVIDES- SPENDING OUR REVENUES TO COVER PROPOSED SPENDING. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALIGN ANY NEW SPENDING WITH THE RATE AT WHICH REVENUES ARE GENERATED- WE BELIEVE THIS ALLOWS- NúMERO MILK NúMERO REVENUES THE FULLY FUND THAT PROPOSED SPENDING. ELIMINATES GENERAL FUND COSTS AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDES MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE DPR FIND. THEN WE ALSO HAVE TO- LARGER POLICY QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE- MIGHT CONSIDER. ONE IS SIGNAL WHERE THE BEST BASIS FOR TIERED TAX- MINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO BASE ITS TIERED MELLUS BASED ON A- PRODUCTS SIGNAL WORD. WHICH INDICATES A PRODUCTS RELATIVELY CUTE TOXICITY TO HUMANS. AND SPEAKING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ACUTE TOXICITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH CHRONIC TOXICITY OR LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS- SO THE EXTENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL- ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES IS. UNCLEAR AS TO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF- ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD ADDRESS A BROADER RANGE OF PESTICIDE RELATED CONCERNS. AND ALSO- SHOULD THE PROPOSAL REFLECT REVENUE TARGETS ARE MARKET SIGNAL- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RATE INCREASES WOULD RAISE ENOUGH REVENUES TO COVER PROPOSED SPENDING ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN THE DPR FINE IN THE LONG RUN. HOWEVER UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIKELY WIDE IN THE PRICE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST TIER BY ROUGHLY TWO PERCENT. I FIND THAT THE RELATIVELY SMALL PRICE DIFFERENCE WOULD NOT LIKELY RESULT IN A LARGE- CHANGE IN THE MIX OF PESTICIDES USED IN THE STATE. THE LEGISLATURE- COULD CONSIDER- A DIFFERENT SET OF RATES THAN BEING. PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OKAY IT IS. THE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SAME GRADE PEST WE WANT PEOPLE TO MOVE TO LA LESS TOXIC- PESTICIDES IN IT MAY BE. IT MAY NOT BE THE PHARMACY THE- MENON WITH CAN GET ON THE SHELF IS PRETTY TOXIC AND- WE KNOW FROM FIRES THAT SOMETIMES. I'LL SAVE THESE THINGS LIKE A TREASURE FOR YEARS THOUSAND HUNDREDS DECADES YOU KNOW THEY WANNA THEY BOUGHT SOMETHING IN THE SIXTIES. IF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VIEWS THE FEDERAL T. SIGNAL WORD IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH WHETHER IT'S BETTER OR WORSE WHAT WOULD YOU. PROPOSE FOR WHAT IS THE IS. ERIN CALIFORNIA HAS MANY OF THEIR OWN STANDARDS% SO THAT I DON'T WANT OPEN UP THAT CAN OF WORMS TO SAY WELL THIS IS WHAT THE REST OF STATES DO WITH THIS IS CALIFORNIA WHAT WOULD. WHAT WOULD IT BE WHAT WHAT WHAT GIVE ME SOME IDEA OF WHAT WOULD USE OTHER THAN THE WORDS- MISTER CHAIR OFFICE DOESN'T HAVE BEEN NAMED ALTERNATIVE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME- WE'RE JUST POINTING OUT THAT. IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING LARGER AFFECTS THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS RELATED TO PESTICIDES THAT SIGNAL WORD WHAT NECESSARILY CAPTURE ALL OF THEM SO JUST POINTING THAT OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- MAYBE EVEN- CONSIDERING OTHER ALTERNATIVES FROM THIS POINT. AND DURING ITS DELIBERATIONS. OKAY GOOD ENOUGH FOR US CENTER DOLLY- MY GOSH OKAY THE- FIRST OFF. I GOT A QUESTION WHAT WHAT SO. THE MIL TAXES BEEN STATIC BUT IT'S GROWN OVER OVER THE OVER THE YEARS BY MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION WHICH- HAS A LOT OF THE DPR BUDGET TO GROW YET FACING THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS OCCURRED. WELL SURE SENATOR DOLLY- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF NEW OBLIGATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS INCLUDING PERS PAYMENTS THAT WE'VE HAD TO MAKE. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND YOU KNOW THE DEMAND OUR PROGRAMS HAS BECOME THAT MUCH GREATER AS WELL SO. WE'RE DOING A WHOLE LOT MORE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT. WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THE BILL'S BEEN STATIC AS YOU POINT OUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS TO REFLECT SOME OF THE NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- I'M MINDFUL OF BEING A CAREFUL STEWARD OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY CHARGE YOUR- AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE PART. OF THE DEPARTMENT. BUT WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO BY CALIFORNIANS FROM THOSE IN THE FIELD TO THOSE IN THE BACKYARD. OUR NEW AND I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN. IN PRACTICES AND TOOLS AND THINGS THAT WILL BENEFIT WHAT CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING US NOW. I THAT INFORMATION I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST OF- EMPLOYEES IS CONSTANTLY GOING UP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S YOUR YOU HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. WHILE YOU'RE ASKING TO INCREASE THE TAX WHICH I BELIEVE IS VERY- MISS GUY I THINK THIS WHOLE THING'S MISS KIND I THINK THE WRONG TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. WE'RE A PANDEMIC. FOR USING YOUR YOUR RECORD WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO USE THESE THINGS TO STAY SAFE. AT THIS TIME WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THE WHOLE. CONCEPT OF HOW WE- REGULATE AND TAX THESE PRODUCTS EASIER HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE USE EVERYDAY I MEAN CENTER MCGUIRE HAS A BOTTLE OVER HERE THAT HAS INTERNET TIES ARE NOT THAT. COULD BE TALKING TO SOMEBODY. SO WHY IS THE TIME RIGHT NOW I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO WAIT ON THIS I THINK IT'S THE WRONG TIME LOOK AS A FORMER WE'VE BEEN USING. AND TRYING TO REDUCE- LOOK WE DON'T WANT TO USE THESE PRODUCTS WE HAVE TO USE THESE PRODUCTS. IS SAME AS THE HOUSEWIFE OR THE- THE GENTLEMAN AT HOME THAT IS TRYING TO KEEP HIS FAMILY SAFE. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING AT A TIME I THINK THIS IS JUST TOTALLY THE WRONG TIME I THINK TO THE CHANGING HOW WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY THEM. IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AND ON TOP OF THAT. BUT WE DID TALK ABOUT OF ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS ASKING FOR ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT THE I. T. PROCESS WHICH IS. YOU KNOW MAYBE A HIGHER DISNEYLAND THEY SEEM TO MOVE PEOPLE VERY EFFICIENTLY AND HAVE WITH THE WAY TO GET THINGS DONE. AND THAT THE I. T. IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S THE E. D. WHETHER IT'S DPR WEATHER'S DGSE. WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW THE- DEPART- NAG THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THERE IT WAS IT'S A BOY. AND IT'S- FUN. AND IT'S BECAUSE- SO FROM I THINK THIS IS. TOTALLY THE WRONG TO. I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IS BECAUSE WE'RE USING LESS PESTICIDES. WE ARE WE'RE AND THAT'S A PROVEN FACT THAT WERE USING LESS WERE USING SOFTER ONES. M. AND WE'RE DRAW AND MORE SO AS THAT. DECREASES THE REVENUE HAS TO COME UP SOMEWHERE WE GET THAT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS THIS IS THE WRONG TIME I DIMINISH THE PANDEMIC TAX. RIGHT NOW WHEN PEOPLE NEED. TO USE THESE PRODUCTS YOU'RE PUTTING A TAX ON IT SO FOR ME IT'S WRONG AND I WANT TO JUST CLOSE WITH LAST THING THAT I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PESTICIDES. THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GROWING. POT MARIJUANA. IT ALL OVER THE PLACE USING PESTICIDES THAT ARE AND AREN'T BEING ENFORCED ARE BEING REGULATED AND IT'S DESTROYING OUR WILDLIFE AND OUR IN OUR STREAMS AND HAVE THAT THAT'S A FACT AND IF THE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST GO TO GOOGLE EARTH AND LOOK AT SISKIYOU COUNTY. IS IT'S CRAZY IF THERE'S A PLACE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT PESTICIDES DR WE WILL BE FOCUSING WOULD BE PUT IN A PANDEMIC TAX RIGHT NOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE NEEDING THESE AND WE'RE GONNA CONFUSE AMONG THE LABELING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT IT. SO I THINK THIS NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE WELL THOUGHT OUT I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE YOU EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND YOUR DEFICIT. IT TAKE SOME TIME THIS I THINK IS TOLD MISSED IN THE WRONG TIME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR DOLE IN IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF YOUR POINTS THERE I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE CANNABIS ISSUE AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ALL OF THE STATE PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHERE MANY ILLEGAL PESTICIDES THAT ARE BROUGHT IN FROM OUT OF THE UNITED STATES AND USED IN THESE MARIJUANA GROWS. REALLY WREAK HAVOC NOT ONLY ON THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT LOCAL WILDLIFE AND FRANKLY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES GOING IN AND TRYING TO CLEAN THOSE UP WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THAT ISSUE BUT WITH REGARD TO THE I. T. PROJECT YOU KNOW I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AND I WILL TAKE THE HIT FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE INCORRECTLY IN THE PAST I THINK WE'VE RETHOUGHT THE WAY WE'RE DOING ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION OF PESTICIDE PACKAGES AND THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IS FAR MORE POSSIBLE. BUT WITH REGARD TO THE SIGNAL WORDS YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT THE SIGNAL WORDS THAT ARE USED BY U. S. EPA THE NON HARSH AND WARNING. DANGEROUS FLASHPOINTS AND- THERE ALTERNATIVES SENATOR HOUSE LIKE YOU WRIST. MODE FOR. NON RESTRICTED MATERIAL BUT WE REALLY FELT THAT THE SIGNAL WORDS. WERE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN TO USERS OF PESTICIDES. AROUND THE STATE AND THAT'S WHY WE SETTLED ON THAT ISSUE. AND FINALLY SENATOR DOLE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT I'D LOVE TO GET UP TO BEAVER AT SOME POINT THIS SPRING AND WALKED THE FIELDS WITH YOU AND- TALK A LITTLE BIT MRE ABOUT WHAT NORTH STATE FARMERS ARE USING IN TERMS OF. PROPERTY ACTION TOOLS I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF MY JOB. ABOUT REGULATE HERE AT THE P. R. OR USED IN. THE AGRICULTURAL SETTING IN ABOUT 50% YOU'D FIND UNDER YOUR SINK. OR IN THE HOUSEHOLD ENVIRONMENT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL. IS WORK TO SUPPORT WHAT I HEAR EVERY DAY FROM LOTS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING GROWERS. AND HOUSEHOLD FOLKS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES AND OTHERS WHO WERE IMPACTED. BY PESTICIDES AND THAT'S TO CONTINUE THE TRANSITION. THAT THE STATE HAS EMBARKED ON OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS TO. SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PASS. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE PESTICIDE USE REPORTS THAT I SEE EVERY YEAR DO INDICATE. THAT THE USE OF THINGS LIKE BIOPESTICIDES AND SO OFFERS ANOTHER ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. ARE GOING UP. AND THE MORE DANGEROUS OR TOXIC PESTICIDES LIKE FUMIGANTS INORGANIC PHOSPHATES AND OTHERS. ARE GOING DOWN. WHAT WE HOPE TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION. I JUST WANT TO SAY LOOK I'M NOT. MAKING THIS PERSONAL I BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND I'M AND I'M NOT. SINGLING YOU OUT AS FAR AS I. T. DEPARTMENT I JUST WANT TO HAVE. I JUST ASK YOU YOU KNOW. GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE OF. IN THE STATE WHERE I TEASE WORK IN IN IT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE JUST HEARD FROM. THE NEW DIRECTOR AT THE EDT. AND YOU KNOW WE GET A NEW DIRECTOR ABOUT EVERY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS MAYBE A YEAR% BECAUSE- THEN THEY BLAME IT ON THE LAST ONE I MEAN. THE POINT IS THAT. I THINK IT'S B. WHO'S THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ACROSS THE BOARD I'M I'M I'M JUST MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF. HERE'S A THE AND YES EVEN IF I MAY IT'S TWENTY TWO. POINTS MIL NOW ON A PROCESS THAT WE DON'T HAVE. AN AYE AND I'M ONE OF THOSE GUYS IT HAS TO OUT THE- AND- THEN DO THIS FOR. ARE MY OWN. SO LOOK IT'S NOT PERSONAL IT'S JUST I THINK ACROSS THE BOARD WE DID WE DID. IN BUT WE TO HAVE A- AND SEE WHAT IS THE- HERE I MEAN THIS IS THE TECH CAPITAL WORLD. THERE ISN'T VERY TO BE A STATE. HERE BECAUSE NOTHING AS FAR AS I. T. WE JUST HEARD FROM THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT- NAG ABOUT HOW WE CAN. STOP THE DUPLICATION OB. YOU KNOW I'LL PROBABLY BE DEAD BY THE TIME THAT HAPPENS. BUT I'M FRUSTRATED I WELL I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU. ANYTIME YOU WANT TO COME UP TO LET'S GO TO SISKIYOU. COUNTY BECAUSE- YOU THERE'S WILD BILL STILL THERE. BUT NOT FOR LONG WE DON'T USE. ABOUT THESE PROGRESS IN IT'S JUST. ME UP THERE YOU KNOW WHO PENALIZED IN THIS PROCESS. IS THE FORMER TRYING TO DO IT. HE ALWAYS GETS. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SAID THAT CAN FIND HIM YOU CAN TAKE IT YOU COULD DO SOMETHING TO HIM AND EVENTUALLY PUT HIM OUT OF BUSINESS. WITH A PARTNER OR WOULD YOU. WE DON'T PUT HIM IN JAIL. BECAUSE OUR WE'RE NOT OUT OF JAIL. NOT NO THERE'S NO WAY TO. THEM ACCOUNTABLE. YOU WANT TO ABOUT FRESH. THE FARM DOWN THIS. WHO IS. INSIST YOU CAN. WHOSE IS TRYING TO HAVE. RIGHT AS YOU LOOK UP ON THE HILL. NCC'S ROAST EVERYWHERE. DESTROYING THE WHILE. THAT HE TRYING TO PUT. IT IS. FLAT WRONG I'M GONNA PUT THE- YOU. I'M SAYING. NEED TO. A GOOD LOOK AT THIS WHEN. TO GO. OUT THERE. AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE- AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE ARE DESTROYING OUR WILDLIFE AND WATERSHEDS. WITH ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN AND IT'S ALL ON US. SO I'M I'M A PARTNER WITH YOU. COME UP LET'S GO DO IT ALL TAKE OUT THERE AND WE'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO LOOK I GOT I GET CALLS FROM MY- SURE EVERY DAY. ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION LEVELS THEY HAVE. TRYING TO GET ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER. AT I'D LIKE FOR. TO AND YOU CAN EVEN IT NOW DO WITH. STRAIGHT EITHER. MISS A- MISTER. I OUR MISTER HALL. OR MISS. A C. INCLUDING IN HERE- FOR BOTH. A MILL. PERCENT POSITION ON GO. FOR AIR MATA. THAT FUNDING AND THEN. IN INCREASE COMMUNITY. IS SET FORTH IN. AB SIX ONE SEVEN. WE KNOW FINANCED YOU GUYS HAVE. ARE ASKING FOR A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY FOR- COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND AIR MONITORING FROM OUR- CARBON REDUCTION PROGRAM CAP AND TRADE. MY QUESTION IS. IS THAT WE KNOW HOW MUCH- COMES FROM PASSED WHAT COMES. FIX SOURCES WHAT COMES ROTATION IS THE- IS THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE DPR FUND WAITED IS THAT THE PROPORTIONALITY OF POLLUTION THAT'S CREATED FROM PESTICIDES. HI LIZZY EERIE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDE REGULATION TO AND TAKE THIS QUESTION THANK YOU. THEIR BRAINS CARRY MORE SLIM ONE OF THE CSU TRACTOR IS I THINK YOU ARE. AND SO DID THE PURPOSE THE FUNDING THAT PROPOSED FOR THE MONITORING AS WELL TO WORK THIS BEING DONE SO. WITHIN THE THAT WE HAVE TO START FUND THROUGH. FUND I'M AND THIS IS PRETTY FOR MOM OR SIDES WE DO THE SAME OR WITH CARD. AND IS ASKING KERR OF HOW WE ABOUT AND- WITH AT AGRICULTURE PASSES USE AND HOW. AT. MONITOR THOSE AT. ACROSS THE STATE. WITH REGARDS THE BUSINESS OR- FOR ENGAGED. THIS WAS REALLY PROMPT FIRED. AROUND A SIX. IN SOME INTENSIVE COMMUNITY. AND EVEN HAVING GET IN PART WITH COMMUNITIES HEARING. I CAN AS WELL AS WITH CARBON WILL ARTISTS BUT WE SEE THIS IS BEING AN AREA THAT WE REALLY. TO EXPAND INTO AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT DOING THERE IS A AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDE IN THE EIGHTIES SEVENTY AT YOU HAVE. A HAVE PESTICIDES BEING YOU. WITHIN THEIR- IS ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES STATE. OF THAT MAYBE NICE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO THAT AND GOVERNMENT HAS THAT'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS MY QUESTION IS AND THEY'LL HAVE TO GET BACK RIGHT NOW BUT- BUT- THIS ISN'T YOUR POLLUTION PROGRAM. IT'S AN AIR POLLUTION PROGRAM TO GO IN THE MONITOR CARE POLLUTION AND SOME PESTICIDES THERE'S GONNA BE SOME PERCENTAGE OF POLLUTION THERE ARE. AIR PARTICLE SINGLE WINDOW IT'S RIGHTFULLY SO COMING UNDER THE DPR. FINANCES ASK FOR A LOT OF MONEY TO COME OUT OF A CRIME RATE REDUCTION GREENHOUSE GASES WHICH IS NOTHING TO DO WITH AIR POLLUTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO MESS YOU COULD HAVE CARBON YOU HAVE. MEANT THING IT GETS FUNDED HERE SO I JUST WANT TO LOOK TO SEE IF THE PROPORTIONALITY IS SUCH IF IT'S NOT AND WE JUST WANT TO DO COMMUTING GAUGE WHEN. FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN THE PESTICIDE WORLD. BE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT THAT DISTINCTION THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE TO SAYING WE NEED TO BE ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES FOR PESTICIDES ON ITS OWN. NOT BECAUSE OFTHE- SEVEN THE POTENTIAL AIR QUALITY IMPACT IT WOULD TAKE IS IT WILL HELP US MAKING THESE DECISIONS AND- DECIDING WHICH PART OF MONEY IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO FUND THESE. PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO DO VERSUS GRABBING FOR THE DAY. THE GREEN PORK THAT'S AVAILABLE ON OTHER PROGRAMS SO THAT'S- IT WILL GET BACK TO THAT THAT'S GOOD. CONNECTICUT AND I CAN PART ABLE OUR APPROPRIATE WE HAVE DO SO. CHANGES OF A OF STEPS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A- TWO MINUTES PAUSE ON THE HEARING AND THEN WILL. WITH A FOR A GENDER ON PAR BE WE WILL HAVE- THE EXCEPT FOR. COMING. OKAY ARE SUBCOMMITTEE- TWO OF THE BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW ON RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY- UNFORTUNATELY WE NO LONGER HAVE TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS INTERESTING THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO STEP FALLS OFF COMING IN. WE'RE GOING TO START OFF WITH PRESENTATIONS FROM THE ENERGY. COMMISSION WITH A- MISTER MONAGHAN AND THEN FOLLOWED BY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WITH THE- YOUR RESOURCE BOARD AND- THE GO BIZ SECTION SILVA MR MONAGHAN GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO SUBCOMMITTEE YOU MAY PROCEED. IT MORNING SHARE NUMBERS- IT'S ACTUALLY MS ON HAND. SO I'M SPENDING MONEY DOWN ON THE LEAD MR FOR TRANSFER AT THE ENERGY PRESSURE- A WARNING TO ALL THE OTHER I'M GOING BE DRINKING A LOT OF HE ADVICE BE- APPARENTLY MARKET A TODAY. THE MORE MY ALLERGIES INTO HIGH SO HOPEFULLY I WILL WILL MAKE IT- BUT DESPITE MY OUR AND REALLY BY TO BE HERE TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S. AS A REAL TO THEIR MISSION YEAH FOR THAT AS WE LIKE CALL THEM. I DON'T YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE WILL OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE AIR RESTORE BOARD ARE COMPLEMENT AND IT'S THE WHAT COMES TO THEIR MISSION VEHICLE MY AGENCY IS THE LEAD FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS THE LEAD FOR VEHICLES. AND ARE AGENCIES WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER- WHEN IT COMES TO THAT AND WE ALSO WORK WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION GO BEARS AND OTHERS AND WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER AND COLLABORATING TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S. GOALS ON CLIMATE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE OF AIR QUALITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW. NEWSOM HAS. GOALS THAT. THE ON A CLEAR COLD. TO ELECTRIFY TRY. THESE NEGATIVE ORDER THAT SUCH THE GOAL THAT A 100% OF NEW PASSENGER VEHICLES WILL BE THEIR EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND ALSO ESTABLISHES GOALS FOR DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT TO ELECTRIFY OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS. OUR SERVICE AND WE RECOGNIZE BOTH THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE THESE AMBITIOUS TARGETS. AND THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF HAVING EQUITY AS A CORNERSTONE TO EVERYTHING WE DO. POLLS WILL BE BUILT ON WHAT WE ARE SEEING HAPPENING AT A GLOBAL LEVEL THE SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES HAVE COMMITTED TO A 1100% ELECTRIC VEHICLE FUTURE. IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR MASSACHUSETTS FOLLOWED GOVERNESS AND LEAD AND SET THE SAME GOAL CALIFORNIA HUNDRED PERCENT. ED'S IN THE PASSENGER VEHICLE SEGMENT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND I MAKERS ARE SEEING THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND THEY ARE DEEPLY INVESTING IN TRANSLATIONAL APPLICATIONS WELL. LAST MONTH GENERAL MOTORS BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN AUTOMAKER HE SAID THE SAME GOAL AS CALIFORNIA 100% YOU NEEDS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND JUST LAST WEEK FORD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS ELECTRIFYING ALL PASSENGER VEHICLES. INTERESTINGLY ALL COMMERCIAL VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY IN EUROPE. THAT'S A REALLY THEY'RE STARTING TO GO MAINSTREAM TODAY THERE ARE FORTY SIX DIFFERENT MODELS OF ELECTRIC CARS AVAILABLE AND MANY MORE ARE ON THE WAY. EARLY NEXT YEAR FORD IS PLANNING TO RELEASE AN ELECTRIC MODELS OF ITS SIGNATURE. F. ONE FIFTY PICKUP TRUCK WHICH IS THE BEST SELLING CAR IN AMERICA. AND ACCORDING TO FORD THE ELECTRIC MODEL WILL HAVE THE BEST HORSE POWER THE BEST WORK AND THE BEST ACCELERATION OF ANY F. ONE FIFTY SO. DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE- IT ACTUALLY MEANS YOU'RE GETTING- A BETTER PERFORMING VEHICLE. AND THE FORD F. ONE FIFTY OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE YOUR POWER TOOLS FROM THE VEHICLE AND FORD IS ALSO- HAVING. THE POTENTIAL FOR THE VEHICLETO PUT TO SUPPLY ENERGY BACK TO THE GRID SO THEY'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS AS HOW DO WE CREATE A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF ELECTROCUTION THAT BENEFITS CONSUMERS. CALIFORNIA HAS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOES FOLD WHICH IS JUST SHY OF HALF OF THE U. S. TOTAL. AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. IS THE NEW MICHIGAN. FOR THEIR MISSION VEHICLES WERE BECAME OUR NUMBER ONE EXPORT LAST YEAR THEY WERE NUMBER TWO THE YEAR BEFORE. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUAL THAT RELATED COMPANIES IN THE STATE AND THIRTY FOUR THAT RELATED MANUFACTURERS WITH A TOTAL OF SEVENTY THOUSAND DIRECT JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY. THE GOVERNOR'S NEWSOME BUDGET- WILL HELP THE STATE SCALE UP AND OVERCOME KEY BARRIERS TO ELECTRIFYING THEIR MISSION VEHICLES. ASSEMBLY THE PROGRAM PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE AB EIGHT PROGRAM PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INCENTIVES FOR THEIR MISSION VEHICLES. AND GRANT THE C. C. BONDING AUTHORITY TO FRONT LOAD BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT RUSSIAN VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES BOTH BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC. INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHY INVEST IN VEHICLES NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR GREEN CARDS FOR ALL. WHICH ALLOWS LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO SCRAP AN OLDER VEHICLE AND REPLACE IT WITH THE ZERO OR NEAR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION FOR CARB HEAVY VEHICLE INCENTIVES PROGRAM PROJECT. WHICH PROVIDES GRANTS TO REPLACE DIESEL VEHICLES WITH ZERO EMISSIONS REPLACEMENT. ANY GRANT PROGRAMS REALLY PROVIDE. EARLY EDITION REDUCTIONS BEFORE REGULATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED THAT WOULD MANDATE THE SWITCH TO ELECTRIC. AND THESE PROGRAMS- ARE CRITICAL FOR AIR DISTRICTS THAT ARE REALLY YOU KNOW TURNING OVER EVERY ROCK IN ORDER TO MEET THE PAYMENT DEADLINES ARE LOOKING FOR EMISSION REDUCTIONS. I'M FOCUSED MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE CONSENSUS FATHER ENERGY THAT- LET ME TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. WE OBSERVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CONVENIENT AND UBIQUITOUS ACROSS THE STATE- WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS. FOR COMFORTABLE BUYING IS THEIR MISSION VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY HAD A CONVENIENT PLACE TO REFUEL IT. WITHOUT INVESTMENT NOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO MEET THE STATE'S TARGETS FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CURRENT GOAL IS TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS TO SUPPORT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION EDIE'S AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE CONDUCTED ANALYSIS OF ALL THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING UTILITIES ARE MAKING PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT'S GROUP THAT'S REPORTED PUBLICLY WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS A SHORTFALL OF SIXTY THOUSAND. CHARGERS BROUGH TWENTY ONE STATIONS SHORT OF THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE'LL NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAMP UP THAT INFRASTRUCTURE POST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO MEET OUR TARGETS FOR TWENTY THIRTY AND BEYOND. SO NOW SAYS THAT- WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO GOING TO GET THE LEGISLATURE IS TO PUBLISH- ANALYSIS OF TWENTY THIRTY CHARGING NEEDS WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN. WE'VE DONE A DRAFT ANALYSIS THAT FINDS THAT WILL NEED ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CHARGERS TO SUPPORT EIGHT MILLION PASSENGERS ADDS. AND THIS IS- WHAT THEY ARE THESE MOBILE SOURCE STRATEGY INDICATES THAT WOULD PUT US ON A TRAJECTORY TO MEET A 100% OF THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. OKAY PLAN ADVANCES FOR GOALS. IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH. CUTTING CLIMATE POLLUTION ADVANCING ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND JOB CREATION. PROMOTING EQUITY. ON THE HEALTH SIDE I THINK YOU THIS IS NO SURPRISE ALL OF YOU- TRANSLATION IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF CARBS AIR POLLUTION. IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE SOURCE OF 80% OF THE STATE NOT FORMING NITROGEN OXIDES 95% OF ITS POWERFUL. DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE NEAR GOODS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS. AND THAT ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THIS HARMFUL POLLUTION. ON THE CLIENT SIDE- IT'S THE SOURCES GASES WHEN YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE EMISSIONS FROM SHALE PRODUCTION. AND OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE SEEN OUR EMISSIONS FROM THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR CUT IN HALF. TRANSPORTATION ISSUES OF ACTION AND. TRENDING UPWARD- IT SIDE YOUR BILL THAT OUT OF SHOULD BE IT JUST. IS NOT DIDN'T THAT WILL SUPPORT RECOVERY EITHER SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THEY'RE GOING TO PUT CALIFORNIANS TO WORK BUILDING. THAT WE NEED FOR THE FUTURE. THE INVESTMENT ALSO SEND THE MARKET SIGNAL THAT COMPANIES CAN BANK ON. FINALLY ON THE ON THE EQUITY SIDE- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB ONE THOUSAND WHICH REQUIRES THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DO AN ANALYSIS EVERY YEAR ON EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF CHARTER DISTRIBUTION. WE PUBLISHED THE FIRST REPORT IN DECEMBER AND WE FOUND- CHARTER DISTRIBUTION PROBABLY FOLLOWS EASY DEPLOYMENT BUT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ENSURING THAT RURAL AND MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ALSO NEED AS A MATTER BEFORE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT HALF OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN MULTIFAMILY DWELLINGS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BURDEN. FOR THEM TO CHARGE. SO TO SUMMARIZE THEIR MISSION VEHICLES ARE THE- NOT TO THINK HELL. GLOBALLY IS ABOUT WILL HELP OVERCOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST TERRORIST BARRIERS WE SEE TO THE COMMERCIAL. COMMERCIALIZATION THEIR MISSION GETS OLD WHICH IS THE OF INTEREST. BY INVESTING. WE WILL MARKETS IN ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL INVESTOR BY INTEREST HERE IN OUR COSTA. GOOD JOB TO HELP THE ECONOMY TO RECOVER. IT WILL ALSO PROVOKE PROMOTE MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ENSURE EVERYONE BENEFITS FOR THE FUTURE. I'M JOINED BY HANNAH RUSSELL WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CHILDREN TRANSPORTATION DIVISION AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND ALSO BY SEVENTY PER GUEST WHO IS ADEPT THE DIVISION CHIEF AT CARP FOR THE MOBILE SOURCE CONTROL DIVISION AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO THANK YOU CAN MAKE A FEW REMARKS ON BEHALF OF YOUR REQUEST. FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND I THINK YOU CHURN MEMBERS BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION- MY DIVISION OVERSEES MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE REGULATIONS AND ALSO MANY OF CARDS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THE CARSON CENTER PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE MULTIPLE GOALS INCLUDING ELECTRIFICATION BY MATT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH BENEFITS AND THE NEED FOR ACCELERATING- TURNING OVER OLDER MORE POLLUTING EQUIPMENTS AND VEHICLES JUST CAN'T BE OVERSTATED. WELL WE'VE ALL MADE GREAT PROGRESS OTHER INVESTMENTS BY THE STATE STAKEHOLDERS INDUSTRY AND LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIANS STILL READ THAT HEALTHCARE. THE REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES BOTH PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S PORTFOLIO REGULATIONS CAN SET DEADLINES FOR THE MANUFACTURE PRODUCTION ON THE SUBSEQUENT ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY. AND INSTEAD OF TOPIC SALARY BUT TAKE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE EARLY AIR QUALITY BEING COMMUNITY HEALTH BENEFITS. SO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RELATIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BEFORE US TODAY THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM YOUR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. ENHANCE THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. SO THE PROBLEM WHERE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO HELP LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ACHIEVE COST EFFECTIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET OUR HEALTH PROTECTIVE FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. IT PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR THE PURCHASE OF CLEAR TECHNOLOGIES. A CRITICAL UNDERPINNING OF THE PROGRAM IS THAT IT TOOK CELEBRATES THE TURNOVER OF OLDER EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES DELIVERING MUCH NEEDED COMMUNITY HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY BENEFITS. AND IS THERE A MOTION TECHNOLOGIES REACH MARKET SCALE. THE GIRL WHERE PROGRAM WILL PLAY AN INCREASING ROLE IN TRANSITIONING THE FLEET FROM COMBUSTION TO ZERO MISSION. AND IN FACT RECENTLY KARMANAU STREAMLINED PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALLER FLEETS PURCHASING ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. THE OVERALL THIS PROGRAM REALLY CULTIVATES A STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CARBON THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS BY BRINGING THE STATE LEVEL RESOURCES TO BEAR AND UNIQUE LOCAL. AND REGIONAL AIR QUALITY SOLUTIONS. AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS AN INCIDENT PROGRAM ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED AB ONE EIGHTEEN WITH THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANT TOXIC IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS. IT HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO. TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND HISTORICALLY EQUIPMENT SERVED AS A BLUEPRINT FOR CLEAN VEHICLES EQUIPMENT INVESTMENTS SUCH AS THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT. AND THE HYBRID AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCK AND BUS FUNCTION CENTER PROJECT OR EACH OTHER. THIS YEAR THE CARDBOARD ALLOCATED A QUICK FUNDING TO SUPPORT. PURCHASE VOUCHERS FOR CLEAN AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS AND BUSES TO REACH THAT AND PROVIDED FUNDING FOR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. THIS IS A PROGRAM AUTHORIZED UNDER EIGHTY SIX THIRTY WHICH PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THEY HAVE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM OR IF HE WAS ALSO AUTHORIZED AB ONE EIGHTEEN AND HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS AS GRAPPLING ELEMENT FOR LOW INCOME VEHICLE OWNERS AND THIS IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. AND IT ALSO HAS A SCRAPYARD PLACE ON MEANT WHEN BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CARP. WHICH HELPS LOW INCOME VEHICLE OWNERS NOT ONLY SCRAP OLDER HIGHER POLLUTING VEHICLES BUT ALSO REPLACE THOSE WITH CLEAR ALTERNATIVES INCLUDING ZERO MISSION VEHICLES. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. BEFORE RIPPING GOING TO HAVE. THE AIRPORT ANYBODYELSE FROM THE A- THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT. FOR GOBIZ. TRINITY CHRISTIAN NOW OKAY I GUESS WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE THE AIRPORT ON HERE YOU KNOW THIS IS SAY THIS IS LBJ ONCE SAID EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE JUST PAPER THEY'RE NOT LEGISLATION RIGHT SO NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO THE LEGISLATURE FEEL JUST GIVE THAT IS BACKGROUND- MY QUESTION IS ON WITH THE AIRPORT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THIS MIX WE GOT A BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU WANT TO DO EXTENSION OF AB EIGHT AND SECURITIZED THOSE AND THEN. FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE FOR CAP AND TRADE IN STAFF REPORT. FULL ON SEPT THIRTY HI CALIFORNIA REBATE PROGRAM WHICH FOR SIX YEARS HAS BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED WAS NOT OVERSUBSCRIBED LAST YEAR AND OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW SOME THINGS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC BUT BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR IS GOING TO BE. DOWN THE ZERO. AND THEN THERE'S NO MONEY IN THIS. PROPOSAL TO MEET THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER I GUESS JERRY BROWN'S ORDER TO GET TO ONE POINT FIVE EXAMS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO IT APPEARS AT LEAST FROM THIS MEMBER THAT. AIRBOARD IS PULLING THE PLUG ON AN OVERLY SUBSCRIBE PROGRAM TO PUT MONEY INTO THE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL ALL WHICH HASN'T BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED. EVER WHY. SO I CAN START AND THEN PERHAPS ALL DEFERRED IDEA OF COLLEAGUES SO I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS HERE THAT DO SUPPORT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE REAL VALUE THERE IS THAT THAT THAT HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A TRANSFORMATION OF THE SIZE AND SCALE AND SCOPE OF WHICH- IS REALLY CRITICAL FOR US TO MEET OUR GOALS- AND SO OVER THE HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE GONE TO SUPPORT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO FIFTY PERCENT. OF A GROUP INVESTMENTS HAVE GONE TO SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION HONORABLY SERVED AS A FOUNDATION FOR PASSENGER AND HEAVY DUTY SERVICE REBATE PROGRAM. AND IF MPS COVERED SPOKE. 81% OF THOSE FUNDS OF GONE TOWARD ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE. HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE KOLLMEYER PROGRAM. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. THAT THE AIR QUALITY- RAMIFICATIONS TO COMMUNITIES ARE ARE REAL AND SO THAT THEY THE FEET PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU IS TO EXTEND THOSE FEES THAT ARE PUT ON POLLUTING VEHICLES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE SINCE YOU'RE ASKING FOR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION FROM OUR CLIMATE PROGRAM WHICH IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE TO DO SERIOUS TO DECARBONISATION. THAT IF WE DO SPEND. MONEY ON ON THE VALUABLE PROGRAMS WE'RE NOT SPENDING MONEY ON DECARBONISATION. AND IF THE IF THE GOAL IS TO GET TO POLLUTING CARS OFF THE ROAD. I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HELP PEOPLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT'S NOT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE POINT. BUT EVEN WE DON'T CARE AT LEAST FROM A CARBON POINT OF VIEW AS WORLD LEADERS. WE DON'T CARE IF IT'S A RICH PERSON A POOR PERSON. PERFECT PERSON SUBURBS ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GET THOSE VEHICLES OUT. AND WE AND WE HAVE. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES NOW. ANY APPEARS THAT YOU'RE SAYING. DONE WITH MOST SUCCESS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. IT WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFICATION OTHER THAN ONE LINE IN THE BUDGET THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO. THINK ABOUT IT SO NOW WE HAVE YOU IN FRONT OF US WITH MISTER COREY. IS THERE TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS THIS IS GREAT THAT THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT AND GOBIZ IN THE GOVERNOR GOT TOGETHER AND YOU GUYS COME UP WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO EARLY ACTION. BUT WE'RE THE LEGISLATURE AND IS GRANTED YOU GUYS WERE TALKING BUT NOBODY WAS TALKING WITH US. ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND ALSO IT APPEARS THAT NOBODY'S PAYING ATTENTION. TO THE- THE BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE HAVE MADE FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS I'M WHAT PROGRAMS WE THINK ARE GOOD. ON DECARBONISATION AND AIR AIR POLLUTION SO- YES THIS IS IN THE EARLY STAGES. WE HAVE THE L. A. L. LET'S GO WITH THE DAILY- YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON.THIS THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROSS BROWN OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I WILL- APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE YOU MIGHT REMEMBER. LAST WEEK'S HEARING THERE WAS A LEAF BLOWER RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW THERE'S NOT ONE RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS- SOMEBODY ACROSS THE STREET SO I APOLOGIZE IF YOU. HEAR ANY BACKGROUND NOISE- SO I DO WANT TO MENTION BEFORE I KIND OF OFFER SOME OF OUR COMMENTS ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF. RELATED IN AB EIGHT PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE REPORTS RELATED TO. THAT AGENDA ITEMS THAT ARE MOST ARE WEBSITE. ONE RELATED TO G. G. R. OUT- EXPENDITURE PACKAGE WHICH WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK AND THE HEARING- BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ONE RELATED TO THE EIGHTY EIGHT EXTENSION ENDS- THE SECURITIZATION PROPOSAL THAT WAS MENTIONED SO I. JUST WHEN I LIKE THAT- FOCUS MOST OF MY COMMENTS ON THE- AB EIGHT EXTENSION. OF SECURITIZATION PIECE OF THIS PACKAGE- BECAUSE WE DO THIN IT'S KIND OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEW PROPOSAL THAT RAISES AN IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- AND I THINK KIND OF OUR OUR INITIAL COMMENT AND TAKING KIND OF BIG PICTURE TAKERS WE DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL. AND THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY STRATEGIES- SO THE PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND FEES THAT RAISE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A VARIETY OF LONG STANDING BY MIDDLE PROGRAMS- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER- DAY PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON REDUCING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALL ON SAID SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS IS STARKLY FOCUSED ON. LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS- WE DID WANT TO FLY THAT YOU KNOW THESE FEES WERE. MO RECENT EXTENDED TWENTY FOUR. AND SINCE THAT POINTS OF ERROR BUT WITH THE STATE HAS ADOPTED A WIDE VARIETY OF NEW GOALS. SINCE OUR LAST EXTENDED RELATED TO- TWENTY THIRTY GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS. AIR QUALITY GOALS THE GOVERNOR AS AS YOU MENTION AS ESTABLISHED EXECUTIVE ORDER RELATED DISASTERS AND THERE'S A COUPLE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THE LEGISLATURE ONE TO KIND OF EVALUATE WHETHER IT DID. AGREES WITH THOSE GOALS AND THOSE TIME LINES- BUT THERE'S ALSO NEW FUNDING SOURCES OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND INCREASES IN FUNDING SOURCES CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED- RATEPAYER FUNDING THROUGH I'LL USE LEGAL SETTLEMENT FUNDING SO THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES- THAT. KIND OF NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PACKAGE. AS WELL AS NEW- NEW OR- PROPOSED KIND OF REGULATORY PROGRAMS THE CARS OR CARS THAT ARE. IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO RE EXAMINE THE STATE'S OVERALL STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVING BOTH CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. I WANT POLICIES REGULATIONS VERSUS X. INCENTIVES FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. AND FRIENDS SENATE FUNDING- I'M A WALK I WANNA WALK THROUGH SORT OF A- A FEW KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE. BY ONE THAT- CONSIDER PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RELATED TO INCENTIVE FUNDING- ONE IS WHAT'S THE BEST SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SO THE EIGHTY EIGHT THESE ARE. A FEW DIFFERENT VEHICLE RELATED FEES WHICH WE THINK. ARE REASONABLE AND HAVE A REASONABLE NEXUS TO BE. A MISSION RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE FUNDED- BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS- FOR EXAMPLE- COULD EXPLORE MODIFYING THE LEVEL OF THE CITY AND MAYBE. SUCH HONESTY THAT'S- BASED ON A POLLUTION FROM A VEHICLE RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF FLAT. FEE PER VEHICLE. GOOD CONSIDER TYING THE LEVEL TO FEED TO INFLATION- OREGON JUST CAN CONSIDER ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MAKES OF FUNDING I MENTIONED. SORT OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WE HOW FOR BOTH YOUR AND SENATE AND FOR FUNDING. I CONSIDER A MAKES YEAR FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE SOME. OF YOU KNOW I- ABOUT HI ELECTRICITY IN THIS IN SOME THE YOU CAN IN A BAR. LOOK ABOUT SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. SORT OF A DIFFERENT MIX OF FUNDING FOR- SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE MAY BE SHIFTING SOME OF THE COSTS AWAY FROM ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS TO. EASE LIKE ADHD IS OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF FUNDING SOURCE- THE SECOND QUESTION WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE BE THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT'S THE NEXT WHAT MAKES THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE FUNDED- IDEALLY- THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS WOULD BE INFORMED BY- AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BENEFITS OF THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON MANY OF THE ABA PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE NOW DO HAVE ESTIMATES OF- COST PER TON OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND SO THOSE ARE AVAILABLE AND SO I THINK THAT'S A- PORTENT STOP UNFORTUNATELY- THE INFORMATION ISN'T KIND OF GATHERED AND PRESENTED HASN'T BEEN PRESENTED TO US IN A WAY WHERE IT'S EASY TO KIND OF COMPARE ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO TRY TO GATHER AND WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. HOPEFULLY HELP PRESERVE IT WASN'TINFORMATION THAT HELPS YOU KIND OF COMPARE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS TODAY ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS MISTER AND MISS SOMETHING. YOU BROWN'S ACT. CAN YOU JUST STOP BY THERE AND WE JUST MAKE THAT FORMAL REQUEST OF THE- BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN EASTER EGG HUNT HERE IF WE'VE GOT. IF THEY KNOW THE COST PER TON ON ALL THESE ABA PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE LOOKING TO USE THE FEES WHICH EVERYBODY PAYS TO REGISTER. TO DO- ZEV CONSTRUCTION IN THE ALLEY- AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T BE. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE SHOULD GET A PRESENTATION SO WE KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE- I KNOW THAT THE L. A. O. HAS INSTRUCTED THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK ON THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING. SO IF WE SECURITIZE. FUNDS AND WE-ALREADY HAVE FUNDS GOING FOR PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE. CARBON AND POLLUTION WHY WOULD WE WANT TO DEFER TO A DIFFERENT AT LEAST AT LEAST LET US KNOW THAT WE'RE MINDFUL BUT- IF. I CAN GET THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT AND THE AIRPORT TO GIVE US THAT. THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY YES WE WERE HAPPY TO KIND OF SUPPORT-YOU IN YOUR STUFF AND THEN TRYING TO GATHER THAT INFORMATION. I'M WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- ABSENT KIND OF THAT NOT MORE CONCRETE INFORMATION THERE ARE. A VARIETY OF FACTORS TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT CONSIDER. ONE KIND OF HOW IT HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDING ACROSS PROGRAMS YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE ARE KIND OF HOW TO EMPHASIZE LIGHT DUTY VERSUS HEAVY DUTY- THEY'RE KIND OF DIFFERENT- PERCENTAGES. OF OVERALL EMISSIONS AND GREENHOUSE GASES VERSUS AIR QUALITY THERE SORT OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE GETTING UPDATED VEHICLES- BALANCE IN CERTAIN NEAR TERM- GOALS VERSUS LONG TERM GOALS AND PART OF THAT GETS INTO. UNLESS YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON KIND OF LONG TERM DEBT REDUCTION GOALS- AND THEN- THE ONE THAT- THE OTHER SORT OF. I THINK YOU CONSIDERATION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON IS THIS ISSUE OF HOW MUCH TO FOCUS ON. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE VERSES VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON BOTH- THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY NEW FUNDING FOR CVR PIECE OTHERS- THERE'S MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON CONCEPT INFRASTRUCTURE AT LEAST AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. OUR VIEW IS IN GENERAL WE THINK FOCUSING ON BOTH. INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS VEHICLE INCENTIVES MAKES. SENSE AND THERE'S WE THINK THERE'S SOME RESEARCH TO SUPPORT KIND OF- POLICIES FOCUSING ON BOTH. OUT WE DO THINK IF FUNDS ARE LIMITED THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE DOES SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH HARD ON ONE THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE A HIGHER RIORITY THAN VEHICLES BUT- NO REASON YOU KNOW THAT. THE RESURGENT SORT OF ENTIRELY CONCLUSIVE IN THIS AREA AND I THINK REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE BUT WE DO THINK OF A FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE DOES HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AND SOPHIA'S. IN MINISTRATIONS SORT OF- PROPOSAL FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE HAS. HAS SOME MERIT. FINALLY. I'M ON THE ACCELERATE PLEASE- THE SEVEN FOR SURE FROM. REALLY SORT OF. WE VIEW IT AS AN EX. OF FUNDING. IT WOULD BE A IN FUTURE YEAR AND SO- INSTEAD SORT OF- HAVE ANNUAL FUND AVAIL FOR SO FOR SURE. OVER THE COUPLE OF DECADES. YOU KNOW A BOND WOULD BE ISSUED UP TO A ONE BILLION DOLLAR BONDS- TO ACCELERATE THAT MONEY FORWARD AND HAVE THAT AVAILABLE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS- AND AS A RESULT THE STATE WOULD BE PAYING DEBT SERVICE. OF UP TO. ABOUT SIXTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES AND SO. ARE WE ARE NOT NOT NOT AS MUCH AS SORT OF AN INCREASE AS AS MUCH AS THAT KIND OF SHIFT- AN ACCELERATION OF THE FUNDING FORWARD- WE AND WE THINK THERE IS SOME MERIT- KIND OF THAT. APPROACH THERE IS AN IDENTIFIED. GAP IN FUNDING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS I WOULD THINK THE FUNDING SOURCE REVENUE SOURCE OF RELATIVELY STABLE SO IT'S A REASONABLE SOURCE TO USE- TO ISSUE BONDS. TRADE OFF WAITING FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST TO- ON BALANCE THE ABOUT SHORT TERM INCREASE IN FUNDING WEST OUT LONG TERM DECREASE IN FUNDING AS THE STATE HAS TO MAKE THOSE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS. IN FUTURE YEARS- AND YOU KNOW WHETHER THE SORT OF SHORT TERM MARKET DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS OR WERE SORT OF LESS FUNDING AVAILABLE IN FUTURE YEARS AND SO THE COMMITTEE WANT MY ONCE A- EXPLORE OF THE ADMINISTRATION DURING THE HEARING ABOUT WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT LONG TERM FUNDING NEEDS BECAUSE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- A LOT OF THAT. A LARGE CHUNK OF THE FUNDING ON ENERGY COMMISSION COULD BE- NEEDED TO PAY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS OF ONE BE AVAILABLE FOR PROJECT. RIGHT NOW I WILL. TRY TO IN MY- THERE I DO WANT TO WE HAVE A OF OTHER RECOMMEND. RELATED TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO ADOPT THE ADMINISTRATION'S SECURITIZATION PROPOSAL FROM OPTIONS FOR. REDUCING THE INITIAL BOND AUTHORIZATION AND LIMITING THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS JUST A HEALTH INSURER. BUT THERE IS ONGOING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY. OVER SOME OF THESE FUNDS ARE HAPPY TO KIND OF THOSE- THOSE KIND OF DETAILED. BUT ALL MY COMMENTS THERE ARE NONE TO ANSWER ANY. BUT COULD YOU GIVE A LITTLE INSIGHT I. I'VE THE COMMITTEE THREE OR SEVEN IS RE. FOR AT ALL THE AND MONEY HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED ANNOUNCED CHARGING STATIONS WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. BUT WE STILL HAVE A SENSE OF. FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN SETTLEMENT FROM THE BMW CHRYSLER SETTLEMENT WITH THE AYE YOU'LL USE YOUR BUILDING. AND WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF. WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ON THE NATURAL THAT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DONE- ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF- OF FIVE STEPS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS. LONG TERM SHORT TERM- A BED AND SET THAT MONEY HAS. TO BE SPENT RIGHT WE HAVE THE- BORDERS. NEGOTIATED A GREAT DEAL WITH SOFTWARE. YEAH THERE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THERE ARE NONE OF ALL THESE OTHER SORT OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON- AS MISS MONAGHAN MET COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN MENTIONED I THINK THERE'S- THE KIND OF PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU DOES KIND OF INCORPORATE WHAT EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT HOW MANY- CHARGING STATIONS- AND PORTS WILL BE SORT OF CONSTRUCTED WITH THOSE FUNDS OR THE FUNDING KIND OF UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE USED TO KIND OF IDENTIFY THE GAPS. BETWEEN WHAT WHAT WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THOSE FUNDS AND WHAT'S NEEDED TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR IS LAID OUT IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN I THINK I THERE ARE SORT OF VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT- IN THE LONG TERM WHAT IS THE STATE'S. ROLLING KIND OF HOW MUCH STATE SUPPORT WILL BE NEEDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THERE IS KIND OF AN EXPECTATION THAT AS THE MARKET DEVELOPS THEN IT MIGHT BE LESS OF A NEED FOR STATE SUPPORT AT THE PRIVATE MARKET WILL TAKE OVER A LARGE CHUNK OF IT- BUT I THINK OF IT AS IT KIND OF COMES TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT LONG TERM FUNDING NEEDS MIGHT BE THERE ARE STILL ARE SOME OTHER. A BIG PIECES THAT IT'S STILL UNCLEAR- EXACTLY HOW MUCH STATE SUPPORT AND I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY STRONG ARGUMENT TO SOME STATE SUPPORT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR EXAMPLE FOR MULTI FAMILY- HOUSING- YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF YOU KNOW PRIVATE MARKETABILITY OF THE KIND OF THE PRIVATE MARKET TO PROVIDE THAT WE THINK THERE ARE SOME KIND OF SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS AND SO THERE MIGHT BE A KIND OF A CONTINUED STATE ROLE FOR THAT. ARE HEAVY DUTY AND FOR STRUCTURE IS KIND OF A GROWING EASTON VERY EXPENSIVE I KNOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS SOME SOME ESTIMATES ON KIND OF WHAT THE NEEDS MIGHT BE THERE SO- YEAH THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING ON BUT I THINK THERE'S JUST GIVEN SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE LEAST SOME OF THE GOALS OF THE GOVERNOR HAS ESTABLISHED THERE'S- YOU KNOW A LOT MORE AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. YEAH IT JUST WOULDN'T. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A- RECORD ABOUT TWO. TO BEEF UP THE- AND TRADE PROGRAMS THAT A PERFORMANCE BETTER. AND CREATES MORE REVENUE AND IF WE'RE TALKING. YOU KNOW AT THE END GAME IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH BEEFING UP THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THAT THIS IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IT'S A IT'S A- SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN. HOW THE FUNDING GOES FROM. THE PROGRAMS FOR REGISTRATION FEE SO IT'S- A- I THE HOPE THAT WE ALL LOOK AT ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX OF FEAR. IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS- THIS STEP BECAUSE- YES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET CHARGING STATIONS AT. AT APARTMENT COMPLEXES IT'S EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT TO GET THOSE APARTMENT APARTMENT COMPLEXES ENERGY EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY MAY BE. ARE SPROUTING UP MORE POLLUTION AND MORE GREENHOUSE GASES THAN THE DELTA IS SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS BE DONE THIS IS JUST ONE OF THINGS SENATOR STERN. YOUR QUESTION YES THANKS MISCARRIAGE WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR- INQUIRY AND I GUESS CAN WE DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER THAN. WHAT WHAT'S THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE. ON THE SORT OF. TO REACH THE GOALS THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT. WHAT WHAT'S THE SORT OF ALL IN NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW FAR WILL THIS PROPOSAL GET US THERE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- STERN. SO OUR ANALYSIS- SPUR OF THE CHAPTER BOARD THAT FOR AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH REQUIRES US ON A BIANNUAL BASIS TO LOOK AT- THAT WHETHER WE'RE MEETING OUR GOALS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND CHARGERS SHORT OF OUR GOAL AND WE'RE TWENTY ONE HYDROGEN STATIONS SHORT OF OUR GOAL OF- TWO HUNDRED STATIONS. SO THERE IS A GAP AND THAT ANNOUNCER STRUCTURE ACCOUNT. ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD COLLECT IN TERMS OF- INVESTMENTS BY UTILITIES AND BY ELECTRIFY AMERICA OTHER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS- AND WE STILL HAVE THAT DELTA. SO WHAT WE WOULD USE OUR- BONTA SPORTY DO THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED BILLION IS TO FILL THAT GAP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO MEET OUR SHORT TERM TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OUR OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT I MEAN AT THIS POINT INFRASTRUCTURE IS. ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST BARRIER I MEAN I THINK THAT- RIGHT THE BATTERIES IN PARTICULAR HAS FALLEN BY 90% OVER THE LAST DECADE. MANY ARTICLES ARE ON TRACK TO BE CHEAPER ON A COST BASIS AND THEIR INTERNAL COMBUSTION COUNTERPARTS OVER THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS. AND SO NOW- THE BARRIER IS WILL I LIVE IN APARTMENT BUILDING I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CHARGE MY VEHICLE I'M NOT GOING TO GET AS THEIR MISSION YES- I WOULD ARGUE- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MACHINE VEHICLE. AND PART OF THE INCENTIVE FOR THIS HONESTLY IS THAT THESE VEHICLES ON A LIFE CYCLE BASIS FOR CHEAPER SO. CONSUMER EPORTS FOUND THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE SAFE CONSUMERS- ELEVEN HUNDRED TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR ON REDUCE YOUR MAINTENANCE. COSTS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERYBODY CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT JUST PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SINGLE FAMILY HOME BUT EVERYTHING. IN IN SEARCH JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT POINT I MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE CATALYST. A LITTLE EARLIER AND SORT OF LEVERAGING IN FINANCE SO IF YOU WENT WITH THE STREET SORT OF CASH APPROACH. VERSES THIS. FINANCING APPROACHES BEEN POSED HERE HOW HOW LIKE HOW MUCH FURTHER CAN WE GET THROUGH LEVERAGE LIKE DO YOU ANTICIPATE FOLLOW ON PRIVATE CAPITAL SAID THAT THIS IS AN ENTIRELY. PUBLICLY FINANCED HERE. YES OUR VISION IS THAT OVER TIME WE WILL REDUCE THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC FUNDING PER CHARGER HARPER HYDROGEN STATION AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ACTUALLY PLAY OUT. ON IT WELL YOU KNOW OUR OUR GOAL IS LIKE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOLD LOOKS SET A COURSE FOR TWENTY. THIRTY AND- LET'S WITHDRAW THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT. RATCHETED DOWN OVER TIME SO WITH THE STEADY DECREASE AND THE MARKET SEES THAT BOTH THE CALIFORNIA IS INVESTING AND THAT WE ARE WE ARE EXPECTING THE PRIVATE MARKET TO TAKE OVER I MEAN THIS IS NOT IN PERPETUITY THIS IS A SHORT TERM INFUSION OF CASH MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON COURSE TO MEET OUR GOALS. AND TO AND% TO GET MORE PRIVATE CAPITAL FLOWING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAST QUESTION THANKS FOR THE TIME MISTER CHAIR- SO. JUSTICE CENTER DOLLIES POINT EARLIER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CATALYST UNCERTAINTIES POLICY EXTERNALITIES THAT MAY LIMIT YOU KNOW YOU GOT MONEY BUT THERE'S OTHER BARRIERS IN THE WAY TOO AND I YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR YOUR PLANNING PROCESS AND SOME OF THE GOALS YOU'VE SET OUT ON SAY SIXTY THOUSAND A YEAR OR TRYING TO HIT THAT TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN A YEAR- I DON'T KNOW. IF IT'S IT C. E. C. OR IF IT'S IF THIS IS MORE OF LIKE A GO BUSINESS QUESTION. BUT THE CENTRAL PLANNING FUNCTION AND SORT OF STREAMLINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT SEEMS LIKE. AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW LIKE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE FOR GETTING. THESE DIFFERENT STATIONS ARE CHARGING OPERATIONS BUILT. HITS ALL KINDS OF IMPEDIMENTS NOT UNIFORM. LOCAL MUNICIPAL CODES- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT FIRE MARSHAL NEEDS ARE- UNDERGROUNDING ISSUES SO IS THERE IS THERE SORT OF. COROLLARY EFFORT THAT MATCHES WITH THIS FINANCING PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT WHAT THE POLICY BARRIERS ARE AND TRY TO HAVE SOME LEADERSHIP AT THE GOVERNOR'S LEVEL TO LIKE. TO REALLY DRIVE THIS FORWARD. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY CAN I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF COPAYS YEAH AT LEAST IT ASSEMBLY NOT OKAY SO GOOD OKAY. YEAH DEVELOP AND THAT STRATEGY THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A STRATEGY- IN CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS. AND WITH AGENCIES. THERE ARE BARRIERS YOU POINT OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S JUST. STREAMLINING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO THAT THAT THE- PROJECT CAN HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY. AND TO GO BEEN HAS A PERMANENT OLYMPICS WHERE THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO CREATE YOU KNOW IT IT JUST SPREAD THE KNOWLEDGE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THIS ISN'T A PAIR THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME. AND YOU KNOW THIS. CHANGE THAT WE ARE- WE'RE SPEAKING IT'S GOING TO TAKE ACTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THERE ARE BARRIERS ALONG THE WAY IT MIGHT. MY SENSE IS THAT THESE BARRIERS ARE ALL SURMOUNTABLE- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF. WORKING TOGETHER AND SO GOBIZ IS REALLY THE POINT FOR THAT. THAT STRATEGY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE THE CDC IS REALLY THE POINT FOR THAT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE GIVEN US THAT AUTHORITY. BUT I WANT TO SAY THE RECORDS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ON WHETHER WE'RE ATTRACTED MEET OUR GOALS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT THE ALBUM REPORT THAT REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR CHARTER DISTRIBUTION. THE OTHER CRITICAL ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE USING TO INFORM AND TAYLOR ARE INVESTMENTS. AND I MEAN I THINK IT IN TERMS OF HOLDING US ACCOUNTABLE YOU HAVE GIVEN US TOOLS. TO TO HOLD OUR INVESTMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO WHETHER WE ARE MEETING OUR GOALS AND WHETHER WE'RE GETTING. JUST AND EQUITABLE WAY. IT'S ZERO POINT YOU'RE NOT ON TRACK TO MEET THOSE GOALS THAT WE'VE ASKED YOU TO MEET. AND THIS IS THE STOP GAP. THE FIRST FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE USED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS. AND THE SECOND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE SENT TO SET US ON COURSE FOR TWENTY THIRTY. BUT I EXPECT HIM INSIDE ENOUGH THAT OUR GOAL IS YOU KNOW HOW EVENTUALLY WANT TO GET RID OF THE PUBLIC WE DON'T WANT PUBLIC DOLLARS GOING TO THE- MARKET TO TAKE OVER. AND BUT THE MARKET ISN'T. DRIVING IT BECAUSE THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH ELECTRIC VEHICLES OUT THERE. THE WINNER IS- ANOTHER SELECTIVE VEHICLE YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT STOCKTON ELECTRIC VEHICLE. CHARGING PROVIDERS WILL MAKE MONEY AND WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP FUNDING THEM. THERE MAY ALWAYS BE A ROLE I THINK FOR SOME PUBLIC INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SO PUBLIC ENEMY DRAWINGS AND LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NORTHERN COMMUNITIES FOR ALL COMMUNITIES LIKE THERE'S- THERE ARE PLACES WHERE. WE MAY NEED TO INVEST FOR A LONGER PERIOD. SO THE FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS IT THE SHOULD. COMMITTEE OTHER. THAT BUILT THE OLD CLICHE WE'RE GOING TO AT THE LOW HANGING. THAT'S OUT THERE SO IF YOU GO TO CITY. PICKLE RIVERA AND THEY SAY WE GOT. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE NINETY NINE NINETY EIGHT LOCAL CONDITIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET. YOU SAY SIERRA AND YOU GO DOWN TO THE NEXT TOWN AND THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONDITIONS WE WANT TO WORK WITH. WITH THE CDC AND GULBIS TO PUT THIS IN. IF THE GOAL IS TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE LOO. THE AREAS THAT ARE. MAKE IT. INVITING FOR CHARGING STATIONS AND HYDROGEN STATIONS GO WIN INSTEAD OF SAYING OH NO WE WANTED IN. CENTER WILL CAL SKIS DISTRICT AND WILL SPEND TWELVE YEARS GOING THROUGH. PERMITTING AND PLANNING WITH THAT WITH THE CITY THAT. THAT IS. UNBELIEVABLE AND WE ARE WE ALL KNOW. WE ARE CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE- HAVE AN IDEA CENTER DOLLY. I REALLY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST MORE OF A COMET- MAYBE FOR THE LEGISLATORS IN JUST MY OWN PERSONAL. FEEL GOOD TO SAY YOU KNOW THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS DOING THE SAME THING. ANNEX IS NOT CHANGING AND GETTING THE SAME OUTCOME- BECAUSE WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER NUMBER ONE THAT THIS IS ALLOWING THE C. C. TO SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THE FUTURE THE SENATOR JUST. THE REASON WHY COUNTY JUST MENTION SOME OF HIS FRUSTRATIONS WITH. THE PROGRAMS AND HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT GIVES US SOME ABILITY TO COME BACK AND SCRUTINIZED. HOW THIS MONEY IS BEING SENT SPENT NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO. WE'D WE- AGAIN A IN THE IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS WAS TALKED ABOUT. NO 80% AN AUCTION COME. BUT WE DON'T EVEN COUNT AND I'M GO BACK TO THIS I'M GONNA KEEP AFTER IT UNTIL MAYBE SUNDAY IT ACTUALLY GETS QUALIFIED AND I HAVE A LEGISLATION TO DO THAT THIS YEAR. WE DON'T COUNT ALL THE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU TALK ABOUT AIR QUALITY WE BURN FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES LAST YEAR AND MILLIONS OF ACRES IN THE YEARS BEFORE. AND WE DON'T COUNT THOSE IN OUR CARBON EMISSIONS. SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT BEING INSANE I KEEP TALKING ABOUT DO WE HAVE IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR CARBON OUTPUT. THEN WE WOULD COUNT ALL THE CARBON THAT WE PUT OUT. AND YOU KNOW THE FOREST HAS BEEN MANIPULATED BY US. THE NATIVE AMERICANS AND GOD ALMIGHTY WITH LIGHTNING MANAGED ARE FORCED BEFORE WE CAME ALONG AND MESSED IT UP. WE SUPPRESS FIRE FOR THE LAST ALMOST HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE HAVE A FORCED IT'S OVER WELL AND WITH FUEL AND IT'S CATASTROPHICALLY BERNIE ON TOP OF. OUR CLIMB IS CHANGING WE HAVE LATER SNOW MORE RAIN AND WIND AND DRYER SEASON SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. INTEL WE REALLY TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN ITS TOTALITY. IN ANY AND WHEN WE DO WE GO ON HERE WE'RE GONNA TAX THE TWENTY THREE YEAR IS EXTENDING A FEE IN TAX TWENTY THREE YEARS. WE'RE GONNA FRONT LOAD IT TO PAY OFF WHAT THE GOAL WAS HALF A BILLION TO PAY THE GOAL. FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH WE'VE ALREADY SET AND NOW UNDER. RIGHT BECAUSE HE SAID NOBODY TALKS TO US YOUR BE A REPUBLICAN AROUND HERE. I MEAN TALK ABOUT NOBODY TALKING TO YOU. IS THIS IS THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE THINGS I CARE ABOUT THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT. BECAUSE IN THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS WE DON'T WE GET LEFT BEHIND AND- THEN IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON. YOU KNOW MORE LIKE TWO CARS WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GET YOU CAN PUT EVERY YOU CAN MAKE EVERY SINGLE. VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC AND WE CAN STILL HAVE A CARBON OUTPUT PROBLEM. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COUNTING EVERYTHING SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD IT. THE LAST TIME I'VE BEEN HERE. BUT ON THIS DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL WE ACTUALLY QUANTIFY IT AND WE DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE I DO TRULY CARE. ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TWO OTHER THINGS I WANT TO MENTION. NUMBER ONE WE HAVE NO RECYCLING PLANT FOR ALL THESE EV'S. N. N. N. SOLAR PANELS THAT WHEN THERE'S LIFE IS SPENT WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH THEM AND THAT AND THAT AND I RAN A BILL TWO YEARS AGO. THAT THAT FORCED THE- ADMINISTRATOR NOT TO MENTION THE DEPARTMENT. TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR RECYCLING BATTERIES WE DON'T WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE HAZARDOUS. IF ONE OF THESE GOES INTO IT GETS IN AN ACCIDENT AND GOES INTO RIVER WHAT THE TOXICITY OF IT IS THAT OUTPUTS RIGHT THEN SO I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON. YOUR BATTERIES RECYCLING AND WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THAT IS BECAUSE OF THOSE AND THE OTHER THING I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. TO IS THE RECYCLING OF SOLAR PANELS THERE'S A LOT OF THE SOLAR PANELS OUT THERE THAT THEIR LIFESPAN IS COMING UP AND THERE'S BEEN NO BONDS. NO NO WE HAVE NO WAY TO GO OUT AND- QUANTIFY HOW WE'RE GOING TO THEM THIS IS THIS ISN'T. GOING TO BE JUST LIKE. MINES WE HAVE I HAD TO HAVE A SUIT ACIDIC MINE AN INCH SHASTA COUNTY THERE'S BEEN PUTTING SULFIDES INTO. THE RIVER FOR YEARS AND IT'S A SUPERFUND SITE. WE'RE GONNA SEE THE SAME THING WITH SOLAR PANELS RECEIVE THESE THESE COMPANIES OR AWAY. BECAUSE THEY TAX CUT. AND THEY'RE GONNA E THEY'RE GONNA BE SITTING OUT THERE WE HAVE TO DO SOME OF THE I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT. KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC. AND FOR THE RECORD THESE ARE THINGS. THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WE GET FOCUSED ON. TRANSPORTATION ONLY WHEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS OUT THAT ARE CAUSING. CARBON OUTPUTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME. WORK TO BE DONE AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE NUMBER TWO. OKAY OKAY I'M GONNA HOLD ISSUE NUMBER TWO AND GO ON THE ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS IMPLEMENTATION OF AV AT EIGHT FOUR ONE I KNOW- DIRECTOR BILL HAND YOU'RE ON THE LINE WHEN YOU WITH YOUR PRESENTATION CAN YOU HAVE BEEN A WE'VE HEARD THAT THE PRICE IS A CERTIFICATION ON THIS E. V. E. I. T. P. PROGRAM IS GONE FROM LIKE SEVENTY FIVE BUCKS A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS ON HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THAT. REMAINS ECONOMICAL FOR PEOPLE IT HAD BEEN ALTERED SMALL BUSINESSES IN THESE CONTRACTORS HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CERTIFICATION AND ALSO IS THERE ENOUGH TRAINING CAPACITY TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS EVEY CHARGES THANKS SO. WITH THAT YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND- MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS MORNING AGAIN GROUP- AND- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND WE'RE EXCITED TO BE THE IMPLEMENTOR OF THE SCHOOL ENERGY EFFICIENCY STIMULUS PROGRAM. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY AB EIGHT FORTY ONE WHAT WHY DON'T I CHAIR TAKE YOUR YOUR FIRST QUESTION BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE DISCUSSION. OF THIS ITEM AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE SEEKING FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS REQUEST IS FUNDING FOUR POINT SIX OF A P. Y. SO A FRACTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL STAFF PERSON. TO LOOK AT THE VERY QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THE EVE V. I. T. T. PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES TRAINING FOR THE USE BOB- FOR THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WERE YOU DISPATCH SOMETIME TALKING ABOUT- BEFORE THIS ITEM SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT- I CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH SPECIFICS ON WHAT THE COSTS ARE LOOKING LIKE THAT THIRTY TO SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS IS A FIGURE THAT HAD BEEN USED- THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAD TRAINING AVAILABLE ONLINE I BELIEVE IT IS NOW- BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING A LOOK AT OVER TIME. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE I GET YOU THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION BECAUSE IT IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE EXACTLY STAFF REPORT TALK ABOUT WHETHER THE STAFF REPORT AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE GOT HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS THAT THIS POSITION ARE SIX TENTHS OF A POSITION IS GONNA LOOK AT SUPPLEMENTS THE PROGRAM VERSES. ANALYSIS SERVER AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEOPLE FOR TO DO THAT AND IS THERE ENOUGH CAPACITY IN A GIVEN GIVEN WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US ON THE ON THE PREVIOUS ITEM THANKS THAT'S RIGHT YES WE WILL WE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THE FUNDING IS FOR AN ONGOING- UP SUPPORT TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES BUT WE- NEED IMMEDIATE ANSWERS TO OTHER QUESTIONS YOU'RE RAISING SO WE'RE WHAT WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU AS TO WHERE THE PROGRAM STANDS RIGHT THIS MINUTE AND- WE HAVE A WORKSHOP COMING UP TO EXPLORE THESE ISSUES AND. TO TAKE A STEP BACK THE BILL CREATES- TO YOU PROGRAMS A FORTY ONE THAT THE PART WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS A IS A SEPARATE PEACE BUT THE PRIMARY- FUNCTION OF THE BILL AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT IS- FOCUSED ON. SCHOOLS LOCATED IN OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THE BILL CREATES TWO PROGRAMS ONE IS FOCUSED ON CLASSROOM VENTILATION AND THE OTHER IS FOCUSED ON INEFFICIENT PLUMBING FIXTURES THE BILL IS INTENDED TO AND I'M GONNA QUOTE FROM THE TEXT BRIEFLY IT'S DESIGNED TO SAVE ENERGY. A JOBS A TIME OF ECONOMIC CRISIS AND PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND QUOTE. THAT'S A PRETTY TALL ORDER BUT WE'RE CONFIDENT WE CAN DELIVER ON THOSE PROMISES AS OF TODAY TO BRING UP TO SPEED WITH WHERE WE ARE THAT THE CDC IS CONCEIVED DRAFTED AND PUBLISHED PROGRAM GUIDELINES WHICH ARE. ESSENTIAL TO RUN THE PROGRAM WE HELD A PUBLIC WORKSHOP AND HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS PUBLIC COMMENTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS. BASED ON THOSE COMMENTS WERE PLANNING TO- PUBLISHED UPDATED GUIDELINES AND THEN STAFF PLANS TO PRESENT THESE GUIDELINES TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION MAY. FOR FOR PROPOSED OPTION AND AT THAT POINT WE'LL BE ABLE TO START FUNDING- ROGER. SAID HE AUTHORIZED UP TO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PER FROM. THIS MORNING WE'RE SEEKING ARE ONLY THREE POINT SIX FIVE MILLION TO SUPPORT TWENTY THREE STAFF. ALSO INCLUDES TOWARD THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT. AND SHARE TO YOUR POINT- NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM A DIFFERENT FINANCIAL BERKELEY TRANSPORTATION FUND. FOR THIS POINT SIX P. Y. FOR THE FOR THE SEPT PORTION. THANK YOU. L. L. L. YOUR COMMENT. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL STAFFING RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL I THINK OUR- THE ONLY ISSUE WE DID ONE FY I GUESS THAT THERE'S A COMPANY IN TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE THE FUNDING. FOR THIS PROGRAM- ANDS AND ARGUED THERE NEEDS TO BE AS YOU KNOW I THINK SORT NEEDS TO BE A STRONG RATIONALE FOR PROVIDING CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY AS IT WOULD REDUCE OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE OF THE FUNDS AND SO AT THIS TIME IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THE- A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY IS NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. INSTEAD ALLOCATING THE FUNDING FOR THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS. SENOL CENTER DOLLY. SO WITH THE THIS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- THE BENEFIT TO THE RATEPAYERS WILL BE FUNDING THE SCHOOL ENERGY EFFICIENCY STEMLESS PROGRAMS. ALL THE SCHOOLS ALL OVER FOR THE SPAWNING AND HOW TO THE RATEPAYERS BENEFIT. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION SENATOR- YES IT IS RATEPAYER FUNDING AND THEY THEY DO BENEFIT AND THEY BENEFIT. BY VIRTUE OF. LUCK LIKE HER SOLUTION SHE PROGRAMS AS WE MAKE OUR SYSTEMS MORE EFFICIENT IN THIS CASE- BUILDINGS IN THIS CASE OUR SCHOOLS. MORE SESSIONS AND- UTILIZING LESS ELECTRICITY THAT- PRODUCTION BENEFIT OF ALL THE GREAT PLAYERS WHO WOULD BE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE PROGRAMS. THE BILL OF THE FUNDS WILL BE DISPERSED IN THE APPROPRIATE- JURISDICTIONS SO ANOTHER WORDS- PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC RATEPAYERS WILL PAY INTO A FUND THAT WILL SUPPORT SCHOOLS LOCATED IN PGNIG SERVICE TERRITORY. SIMILAR WITH THE OTHER. PLAYERS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO IT AND IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY OF SCHOOLS THE LEGISLATION DIRECTS US TO FOCUS ON LOW INCOME SCHOOLS OUT FIRST AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE INTEND TO DO. NOT JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP SO IF YOUR BUSINESS IS ONLY A CHARGING I'LL USE SO IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE I. O. U.'S TERRITORY. ARE YOU IS YOUR SCHOOL STILL AVAILABLE. AVAILABLE FOR THESE BONDS. THE ONLY ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS ARE THE ONES LOCATED WITHIN THE SERVICE TERRITORIES THAT ARE PLENTIFUL. OKAY THANK. FORGET ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER HANDS WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER AND MOVE ON TO CONTINUE EITHER SCHOOL BUS THING ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS- SB ONE TEN IS A TWO YEAR. THREE QUARTERS OF MILLION DOLLAR I REQUEST AND LET'S SEE WHO WE HAVE. MISCIBLE HOT YOU'RE UP AGAIN. EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU GET YOUR MEMBERS RIGHT SB ONE TEN DIRECTED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO- GO TO ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES THESE WERE FUNDS THAT WERE LEFT OVER FROM THE PROP THIRTY NINE PROGRAM. AND THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS DESPITE THE MANY CHALLENGES OUR SCHOOLS FACED LAST YEAR. YOUR REALLY QUICK BACKGROUND WE ISSUED A SOLICITATION IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO ALL SCHOOLS WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING AND MANY DID. WE RECEIVE APPLICATIONS FROM TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS FOR OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PLUS. THE FUNDING ALLOCATED PERMITTED US TO AWARD A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE BUSES. AS OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF LAST YEAR SIXTY ONE OF THOSE BOXES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO SCHOOLS- SO WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT OUR GRANTS ALSO PROVIDED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BOX FOR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

PROP THIRTY NINE THAT THE MONEY HOW MUCH MONEY IS LEFT IN OF THE PROP THIRTY NINE BECAUSE WE HAVE IT LOOKS THAT WILL GET ALLOCATE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO WE DID THAT IN TWENTY. SEVENTEEN SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT WE HAVE THE STAFF PEOPLE FOR TWO YEARS WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY IN THIS PROGRAM I GUESS IS WHAT I'M ASKING. YEAH THE PROPERTY NINE PROGRAM OVERALL WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL- WE HAD. APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WORK WAS WAS ALLOCATED OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT THE FUNDS WERE COLLECTED. AND WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND THAT THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED ELEAZAR- IN LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES IN THE STATE PARTICIPATE SO THERE'S GREAT UPTAKE AND THE MONEY WAS DISPERSED WIDELY TO SERVE SCHOOL STRUCTURE TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL IN THE FINANCE YOUR QUESTION- THIS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS WAS FUNDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED A COUPLE YEARS AGO IS NOT HAVING BEEN- REQUESTED THERE WAS VERY LITTLE LEFT OVER MONEY AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OUT OF ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION WAS WHICH ONE OF THOSE TRUMP. AND HOWEVER AS WE SIT HERE TODAY WE HAVE. WE STILL HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT SOME FUNDS. THAT ARE- THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SET YET- IT AS WE SPEAK AND I CAN GET YOU EXACT FIGURES ON THAT SENATOR. I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE CALL THE MAY REVISE EVERY GET RE PURPOSING NOT MINE NUMBER SOLD COMMITTEE OKAY. LMAO ARE YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE SCHOOL BUS. I REQUEST. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES RAISED WITH THIS- PROPOSAL MR. OKAY VERY GOOD TO US. THANK YOU ON THE CLARIFICATION AND THE AFFORDABILITY ON THE- THE ELECTRICAL SIDE LET'S WE'RE GONNA HOLD ISSUE NUMBER FOUR MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE AND THIS IS THE EPIC PROGRAM- MISTER DIRECTOR BOHAN EUROPE AGAIN. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MEMBERS- THIS THIS THAT THE THINK THE ENERGY COMMISSION SEPARATE PROGRAM THIS IS OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM THE PREMIER RESEARCH PROGRAM IN AMERICA IF LINE'S ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROJECTS NEARLY ALL THE FUNDING THAT WE AWARD ISSUE COMPETITIVE AND WE AIM TO KEEP IT THAT WAY THIS IS A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM HOWEVER OUR PROCESS IS VERY THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATE. IT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR FROM CONCEIVING- AN AREA WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND HOLDING WORKSHOPS PUTTING OUT THE SOLICITATION ITSELF EVALUATING APPLICATIONS ETCETERA ULTIMATELY AWARDING FUNDS THAT WHOLE PROCESS CAN OFTEN TAKE A YEAR LAST YEAR. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTEEN GRANTED US AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL FOLLOW ONE FUNDING FOR MERITORIOUS RESEARCH PROJECTS UNDER VERY STRICT CONDITIONS AGAIN ALMOST ALL FUNDS ARE AWARDED COMPETITIVELY BUT WE WANTED NARAL CARVE OUT THE END OF WHAT WHAT THE CONDITIONS WERE FLAWS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FALL ONE FUNDING SO IN ORDER TO AWARD FUNDING TO A MERITORIOUS RECIPIENT. TO COMPLETE A PROJECT TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AND MEET A BUNCH GREATER I WILL READ THEM ALL BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THE PRIMARY RISK. OF YOU KNOW TO BE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. JIM SPELLMAN OF 80% OF FUNDING ITSELF. THE ORIGINAL PRICE HAD TO HAVE BEEN COMPELLED BID. THE PROJECT TO HAVE DONE IT'S A RISK. THE OF ESTá POTENTIAL EXTRA DRESSING TERM PRIORITIES SUCH A WHILE FOR AND THE LIST GOES ON BUT JUST TO GIVE A SENSE THIS THESE ARE THESE ARE VERY NARROW STRIP CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE FOLLOW ON FUNDING WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. WHAT WE'RE SEEKING DOES THIS MORNING FROM YOU IS AFFORDED TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THIS STRUCTURE WE'VE BUILT TO ALLOW FOLLOW ON FUNDING GOING FORWARD SB ONE FIFTEEN GRANTED ONLY FOR THIS YEAR AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE IT. AND WE THINK IT'S- IT. GIVEN THAT WE'VE GOT SOME PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FOLLOW ON FUNDING THAT COULD- SERVICE BOB. CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING THIS COMING SUMMER WITH RELIABILITY. NOW THIS THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED A REPORT OR SORT OF A SENIOR YEAR AND I THINK THAT SORT OF THAT THAT ANALYZES THESE TO THE COMPETITIVE GRANTS WE GAVE OUT THESE ARE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THIS IS HOW IT'S AFFECTED YOUR LIFE THAT TYPE OF STUFF IT DESERVES A LIKE THAT COMES OUT OF. ABSOLUTELY WE DO AN ANNUAL REPORT. AND WE PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND IT'S AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AND I CAN I CAN GET YOU THE MOST RECENT ONE- OR OR ANY OF THE U. S. OKAY LMAO YOU INDICATE THAT. YOU WANT SOME SORT OF NOTIFICATION BEFORE THINGS ARE FUNDED ON THE FOLLOW ON. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE EPIC. JUST REPORTING WHAT THEY DID BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AND THEIR- WHO'S HERE. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT MISTER CHAIRS ACROSS FROM OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DO THANK PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF AUTHORITY AND FLEXIBILITY- COULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE- IN THOSE SORT OF LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE- DIRECTOR TALKED ABOUT- BUT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING A REQUIREMENT THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION NOTIFIES. LEGISLATURE BEFORE KIND OF AWARDING THE FOLLOW ON FUNDING- RIGHT RIGHT NOW I THINK THE PROCESS WOULD BE THAT THE NOTIFICATION WILL COME AFTER THE AWARD AND SO- PROVIDING THE NOTIFICATION BEFORE THE AWARD WOULD JUST ADD A LITTLE ADDITIONAL KIND OF OVERSIGHT BEFORE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY ALLOCATED AND- THIS COULD BE SIMILAR TO THERE'S AN EXISTING. JAIL BC NOTIFICATION PROCESS THAT THE CDC USES ONE OF THE AWARDS- SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS WHERE THERE'S SORT OF AN EXEMPTION TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR COMPETITIVE BIDS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDERING ADOPTING SORT OF A SIMILAR TYPE OF PROCESS HERE AS. WELL GOT IT SENATE ALI. I WOULD JUST SAY I BE IN. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. MORE OVERSIGHT THAN LAST WE'VE SEEN. OVER THE PAST YOU KNOW TIME THAT THERE'S YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE SURE THEY'RE COMPETITIVE AND IT'S DONE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO DO THAT SO IN THIS IS. ASKING FOR PERMANENT AND THEN IN THIS EPIC LAST YEAR WAS ONE WELL I WON YOUR AUTHORIZATION AND THIS IS WOULD BE- CONTINUES TO. BASICALLY A PERMANENT- PROGRAM AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE LOOK AT THAT AS WELL. OKAY THIRTY BEHIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE DONE WITH THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT THIS MORNING- AND LET'S SEE WHAT IN EARTH.
