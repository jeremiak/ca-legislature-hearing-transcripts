GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME. THIS IS SECOND HEARING A BIT AT AS JOINT HEARING BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE COMMITTEE. AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HOUSE WHICH WILL EXAMINE OUR STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE I SYSTEMS. I THIS IS THE SECOND OF A MEETING THE FIRST YOU MIGHT RECALL HAPPENED. UP BACK IN DECEMBER AND IT CAN IN FACT. DURING THAT TIME. IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE LEFT THE MEETING. WE WE HAD NOTICED AND KNOWN THAT THERE WAS LARGE WILDFIRE SPREAD ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS A REALLY TIMELY CONVERSATION. AT THAT TIME IT IN SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MORE IMPACTED BY MIGHT SPEAK TO THAT BUT HUNDREDS OF HOMES AND BUSINESSES WERE DESTROYED. THOUSANDS WERE FORCED TO EVACUATE. INCLUDING MY CO CHAIR HERSELF AYE I BELIEVE. I'M FORTY CALIFORNIA'S NOT A. A STRANGER TO DISASTERS IN WE'VE NOW KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S ECHOED IN OTHERS OF ECHOED IN THIS BUILDING. THAT UP WHAT WE ONCE KNEW AS A OCCURRENCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HAS BECOME THE NEW NORM AND WE EXPECT. DISASTERS TO HAPPEN UNFORTUNATELY AND IT'S NOT A MATTER OF. WELL IF IT HAPPENS AT A MATTER OF WHEN IT HAPPENS AND WE WANT TO BE A WELL PREPARED. AND YET NO YET NO EVENT WAS MORE DRAMATIC AND DEMONSTRATED IN SOME CASES THE FAILURES OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AYE THE NINE ELEVEN IN THE INABILITY OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER DURING THAT CRISIS. I THAT SOCK AND HORRIFIED OUR NATION. AND ALL THAT WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WE'VE NOW TAKING A MAJOR STEPS TOWARD ESTABLISHING A NATIONWIDE. UP PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK. WITH FIRST NET WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSING DAY. BUT SOME ISSUES STILL REMAIN THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE. WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE WE'VE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCES. ALREADY WE ARE FOR THE NEXT WALL FIRE THE NEXT EARTHQUAKE OR THE NEXT NINE ELEVEN THAT HAPPENS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME. FOR EXAMPLE IS IS MY DISTRICT WHICH WILL HOST OF THE OLYMPICS AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED. IN FAILURE DURING NINE ELEVEN I'M AND MAYBE WOULD POTENTIALLY THAT THIS IF IT IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. IN THE NEAR FUTURE WHAT WE WOULD DO AND HOW WOULD BE DEFERRED AS IT RELATES TO. COMMUNICATING AND FIRST RESPONDERS. I AND WHAT RESOURCES THIS PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS NEED. TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE ASK OF THEM EVERY DAY. SO I WANNA THANK ALL OUR COLLEAGUES OVER HERE TO THE AS A VERY IMPORTANT I'M HEARING A ONE. HANDED OVER THE CO CHAIR FOR A BRIEF COMMENTS AND WE'LL GO TO OUR A COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND I ALSO WANT TO EXTEND MY WELCOME TO. OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN OUR DISTINGUISHED AGAINST WHOM WE OR FROM WHOM WE WILL HEAR TODAY. AND PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO TRAVELED TRAVELED UP OF FROM MY DISTRICT IN. THE CENTRAL PART OF THE COASTAL CALIFORNIA AREA. YOU'VE DISCOVERED IT'S NOT EASY TO GET HERE FROM THERE BOTA AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I AM MOST APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU ARE JOINING US. I REPRESENT THE NINETEEN STATE SENATE DISTRICT WHICH IS ALL OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND ALL OF WESTERN VENTURA COUNTY I ALSO. A CHEER ROSE WAS MENTIONED OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF ASSURING THAT OF THIS IS NOW THE FOURTH YEAR WE ALTERNATED BETWEEN THE HOUSES AS WE DO WHEN. LAST YEAR MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WAS THE. CHAIR FOR THAT TWO YEAR SESSION. I'M EXCITED TO BE BACK DOING US BUT HAVE NOTED THAT THINGS CONTINUE TO. SEEM TO ACCUMULATE WE'RE NOW. WE CHOSE TO EXPERIENCE THE. WORST I THINK FAR. WILDFIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY THIS PAST YEAR. THE FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN OCTOBER FIRES BEFORE THEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN OF COURSE AS. WAS MENTIONED THE. THOMAS FIRE WHICH SHOW. A OCCURRED LITERALLY AN HOUR AND A HALF AFTER WE GAVEL DOWN THAT FIRST HEARING ON DECEMBER FOURTH. WHICH FOR THE NEXT FORTY DAYS BURNED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SQUARE MILES. OF MY DISTRICT. EVERY INSTRUMENT WAS A FROM SANTA PAULA TO OF THE HILLS ABOVE MONNA SETO. AND US WAS ALSO MENTIONED I WAS ALSO FORCED TO EVACUATE FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT SIX DAYS PERSONALLY SO THIS. THIS EXPERIENCES WHEN I ALSO HAD TO. TO ENSURE. PERSONALLY AS WELL AS PROFESSIONALLY AND CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR CONSTITUENTS IN OUR STATE TO THE EXTENT WE CAN WITH THIS KIND OF NOTICE AND. THE DISCUSSION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TODAY SO. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AS I MENTIONED IT CONTINUES THIS IS I THINK THE FOURTH OR FIFTH HEARING WE'VE HAD THIS IS THE SECOND WHEN DEALING WITH OUR EMERGENCY SYSTEM. AND THESE ARE. A COLLECTION OUR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS A COLLECTION OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT. THAT ALLOW OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER DURING AN EMERGENCY IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED. IS THAT THE CRITICAL TIME IN SAVING LIFE AND PROPERTY IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THESE EVENTS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ABLE TO TALK A TO EACH OTHER. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO EXAMINE HOW WELL THAT RESPONDER TO FIRST RESPONDER PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM PERFORMS. AS WAS NOTED. AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S BEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS SINCE NINE ELEVEN. BECAUSE I WAS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THAT EVENT OCCURRED. I'VE TIME REALLY DOES FLY BY. AND OF COURSE WE LEARNED SADLY THROUGH THE TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVE NOT OR HAD NOT AT THAT TIME DONE ENOUGH. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE COULD COMMUNICATE TODAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS SO DIFFERENT WHO COULD HAVE ENVISIONED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ARE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. LOOK LIKE TODAY SO. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS EXAMINE HOW WELL OUR FIRST RESPONDER TO RESPOND OR SAFETY COMMISSION OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PERFORM? I AM PARTICULARLY ON HOW WELL THEY PERFORM DURING OUR RECENT DISASTERS AND SPECIFICALLY I THINK WE'RE GONNA TALK QUITE A BIT ABOUT THAT. THOMAS FIRE. ARE HEARING ON DECEMBER FOURTH FOCUSED ON THE FIRES PRIMARILY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAD TO ENORMOUS LOSS OF LIFE AND OVER EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES AND STRUCTURES DESTROYED NO I THINK FORTY FOUR PEOPLE KILLED THERE. SO. AGAIN. WE TALK ABOUT THE FIRE OF THE THOMAS FIRE BUT AFTER THAT AFTER BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF. JUST FEELING THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY AND SO BLESSED TO HAVE THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO WOULD COME. TO THE VETERAN SANTA BARBARA AREA EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED AT ONE POINT TIME WE HAD PREPARED TO. FIGHT OFF THE FIRE THAT WAS JUST BURNING UNCONTROLLABLY AND WE'RE ABLE TO. LOSE A A LIMITED NUMBER OF HOMES AFTER THE FIRED STARTED WE LOST ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES ANOTHERFOUR% HUNDRED IN. A UNINCORPORATED PARTS OF VENTURA COUNTY BUT SAVED MOST OF THE HOMES THAT WERE VULNERABLE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND THEN ON THE NIGHT OF JUNE BY JANUARY NINTH WE WERE ALL BACK IN OUR HOMES FEELING VERY BLAST. EVENT THAT. DROPPED BILLION OF MILLIONS I SHOULD SAY OF CUBIC OF FEET OF MUD. THROUGH THE MANSIO AREA THAT KILLED TWENTY THREE PEOPLE AND. DECIMATED ONE OF THE TRULY MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD COST ME ITS STILL BEAUTIFUL PLEASE COME AND VISIT. AND THEN GO HOME. BUT JOB IT WE REALLY HAVE A LOT THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER BECAUSE WE ARE IN A TWELVE MONTH FIRE SEASON WE ARE IN. A NATURE IS pIN VERY DRAMATIC AND SEVERE WAYS AND WE HAVE. WORK TO DO SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD WITH THE REST OF YOU. TO THIS CRITICAL DISCUSSION. I THINK MANAGER I WANNA. EXTENDER. CURSE YOU GO BOTH VICE CHAIRS MISTER RODRIGUEZ AND A MISTER LACKEY IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER IF YOU'D LIKE TO ALSO ON. DO ANY COMMENTS. SURE OFFERS MOMENT THINKER SENATOR JACKSON AND SOME RUMORED SANTIAGO FOR BRING US TOGETHER. TO TALK ABOUT VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE REGARDING COMMUNICATIONS ESPECIALLY DURING THE DISASTERS AS WE WHAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR THE FIRES. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR LAST YEAR IN DECEMBER A NO FLOOD FOLKS AWARE OF. AUTISTIC CALIFORNIA OPTED TO JOIN THIS FIRST NET. KIND OF FEDERAL OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE MERGER RESPOND HERS. AND SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO REACT TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE SYSTEM IN PLACE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO PROBABLY A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND HOW BOTH SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER. BUT WHAT'S BORN THAT WE GOT EVERYBODY TALKING TOGETHER AS FIRST RESPONDER MYSELF COMMUNICATIONS ALWAYS A KEY FROM THE TIME WE GET THE CALL TO THE TIME WE GET THERE AND. THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE FACING WHICH DEAL WITH THEM TOP RESOURCES YOU NEED SOME LOOKING FORWARD TO A VERY EVENTFUL DISCUSSION AND HOW THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK. HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US ALL TOGETHER TALK ABOUT THIS PARTNERSHIP THANK. MISTER LUCKY IF IF YOU WISH TO OF COURSE. BUT ALSO LIKE TO THINK OF BOTH THE CHAIRS FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING THIS IS. COMMUNICATION IS SUCH A PIVOTAL PART IN THE SUCCESS OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND. AS A MEMBER OF THE HYPERTROPHY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS I COULD SAY THERE WERE A NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE. A CONSOLIDATED NETWORK WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL. IT IS A. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE STILL EVEN IN THIS MODERN DAY TODAY OF OUR INTER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN. AGENCIES BOTH. FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND ALL ASPECTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I STILL HAVE SOME LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER SO THIS IS A GREAT REMEDY. AND. SOMETHING I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR MORE MORE ABOUT AND. LIKE TO CONGRATULATE. EIGHTEEN TEA FOR THE FIRST NET CON CONTRACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE GREAT SUCCESSES ARE GOING TO ENJOY THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE THEIR THAT ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO. WOULD LIKE TO SAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER BRIEF YOU GUYS A STEPS IN THIS MEETING IN THE EARLY DEL IN OF THIS AND AND TALK ABOUT AS A FIRST RESPONDER FOR THIRTY YEARS. A CHANCE TO RESPOND SOME FIRES AND FLOODS OF OFFERING MUTUALLY DO MY TIME THE SECOND A COUNTY. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND AN INABILITY AS IMPORTANT AS WILL REDUNDANCY IN BACKUP SYSTEMS. WITHIN OURSELVES GOING UP TO EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND OUR READERS WOULD WORK BACK IN THE DAY BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE SAME SYSTEM IT HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT. BUT. IN MY OPINION. HERE WE ARE GOING TO THIRTY YEARS LATER DOING WITH THE SAME ISSUES. AS IMPORTANT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA WORK. GET OUR FIRST RESPONDERS OTHER MATTER WHO YOU WORK FOR WHETHER IT'S A SURE FORMER POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE YOU MASS OR FIRE YOU WILL MAKE SURE THE SYSTEMS WORK TOGETHER. I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS. GONNA BURST IDEAS AND HOPEFULLY CONSUMED SOLUTIONS AND ONCE AGAIN WAS JUST THE START THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THIS SOUTHERN FLORIDA.

CHAIR SANTIAGO CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS MY NAME IS JOE TYLER I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF FIRE PROTECTION CHIEF OF FIRE PROTECTION FOR CAL FIRE. SO. I'M HERE TODAY. TO TALK ABOUT. THE DECEMBER FIRES SEE AS YOU HAD MENTIONED BEFORE. CALIFORNIA'S IN A FIRE A YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON. IT SEEMS TO NEVER STOP ANYMORE INDEED A CLIMACTIC CHANGES. IT CONTINUES TO WORSEN. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO MY. MY POSITION HERE TODAY IS TO DISCUSS WITH YOU A SPECIFICALLY THE AT DECEMBER WILDFIRES AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE OCTOBER WILDFIRES IN MAY ACROSS BACK AND FORTH WITH SOME STATISTICAL INFORMATION. BETWEEN THE TWO BUT. AS AS YOU'VE STATED ALREADY ON DECEMBER FOURTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND FOR THE TWO WEEKS OF FOLLOWING THAT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO WILDLAND FIRES BROKE OUT ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UNDER THOSE RED FLAG CONDITIONS AND THE FIREFIGHTERS FIRST RESPONDERS. A LAW ENFORCEMENT DEALT WITH THOSE RED FLAG CONDITIONS IN THE SANTA ANA WIND CONDITIONS OFTEN ON THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FOURTEEN DAYS. OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO A WILDLAND FIRES BROKE ON THAT TIME FRAME ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN OF THOSE FIRES. WERE CONTAINED IN THEIR INITIAL ATTACK PHASES OF A SIX OF THOSE FIRES GREW INTO. LARGE AND DAMAGING A FAST MOVING FIRES IN WHICH WE ALL HAD TO DEPLOY RESOURCES TO. OF THE SIX FIRES OF THEY WERE PUSHED BY THE STRONG AND DRY SANTA ANA WINDS. DURING A TIME IN WHICH RELATIVE HUMIDITY IN SUMMERS AREAS REACHED AS LOW AS ONE PERCENT. AND. ON ONE PARTICULAR DAY LOOKING AT THE WEATHER IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA FOR THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY ACTUALLY REGISTERED AS ZERO PERCENT. THE FIRES BURNED UNDER ONE OF THE LONGEST DURATION SANTA ANA WIND EVENTS IN HISTORY CAUSING RED FLAG WARNINGS TO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR HISTORIC THIRTEEN DAYS. WHICH WAS THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME CALIFORNIA THAT A A STAINED RED FLAG EVENT OCCURRED. THE SIX FIRES. COMBINED BURNED OVER THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ACRES AND DESTROYED OVER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE STRUCTURES AND ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY STRUCTURES THAT WERE DAMAGED. THE THOMAS FIRES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY BROKE OUT ON DECEMBER FOURTH IT. AT SIX TWENTY EIGHT IN THE EVENING. AND IT WAS THE FIRST OF SIX WHAT LARGE WILDFIRES THAT BROKE OUT. THE FIRE STARTED NORTH OF SANTA PAULA. IN VENTURA COUNTY MOVING INTO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND WOULD ULTIMATELY GOING TO DESTROY ONE THOUSAND SIXTY THREE STRUCTURES. TAKING THE LIVES OF TO INDIVIDUALS AND BURNING OVER. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE ACRES. MAKING IT THE LARGEST WILDLAND FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THE CREEK FIRE OCCURRED SHORTLY THERE AFTER ON DECEMBER FIFTH AT THREE FORTY FOUR IN THE MORNING IT STARTED EAST A SILMAR. THAT IT WAS EVENTUALLY CONTAINED AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETEEN ACRES AFTER DESTROYING SIXTY RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES. AND ANOTHER SIXTY THREE STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED OUT BUILDINGS OR OTHERWISE WITH AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY ONE STRUCTURES THAT WERE DAMAGED. THE RIFLE IRA OCCURRED ON DECEMBER FIFTH. AT A ELEVEN THIRTY ONE IN THE MORNING IS STARTED IN THE AREA SANTA CLARITA. IT WAS CONTAINED AT SIX THOUSAND FORTY NINE ACRES AFTER DESTROYING SIX RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES AND DAMAGING ANOTHER THREE. THE SKIRBALL FIRE OCCURRED ON DECEMBER SIXTH AT FOUR FIFTY TWO IN THE MORNING. AN AREA OF THE FOR A FIVE FREEWAY IN MULHOLLAND DRIVE. I IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IT WAS CONTAINED OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO ACRES SIX STRUCTURES WERE DESTROYED ANOTHER TWELVE WERE DAMAGED. THE LILAC FIRE OCCURRED ON DECEMBER SEVENTH. AT ELEVEN FIFTEEN IN THE MORNING. IN THE AREA OF OLD HIGHWAY THREE NINETY FIVE IN THE BOND SOUL AREA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. IT WAS EVENTUALLY CONTAINED AT FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ACRES AFTER DESTROYING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN HOMES. IN ANOTHER SIXTY FOUR STRUCTURES THAT WERE DAMAGED. AND THEN FINALLY THE LIBERTY FIRE THE LAST OF THE SIX STARTED ON DECEMBER SEVENTH AT ONE FOURTEEN IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE COMMUNITY OR THE CITY OF MARIETTA. AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY IT WAS CONTAINED AT A THREE HUNDRED ACRES AFTER DESTROYING ONE HOME AND ONE OUT BUILDING. ONE OF THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES A FIREFIGHTER SPACE THERE WERE THESE UNFORGIVING WEATHER CONDITIONS THE LACKEY HUMIDITY THE TENDER DRIVE EDUCATION. AND SOME OF THE STRONGEST SANTA ANA WINDS AS WE'VE DESCRIBED CREATED A CONSTANT BATTLE TO STOP THE THREAT. OF THESE FIRES. ON THE FIRST DAY THE THOMAS FIRE LOAN THE FIRE SPREAD OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES IN A SPAN OF ONLY NINE HOURS. ON DECEMBER FIFTH A STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED IN MENTORING LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S FOR THAT THOMAS CREEK IN RYE FIRES. ON DECEMBER SEVENTH THE STATE EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY DUE TO THE LILAC IN THE THOMAS FIRES. BY DECEMBER EIGHT THE FEDERAL DECLARATION WAS APPROVED FOR CALIFORNIA. ALL IN ALL. OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PERSONNEL INCLUDING VARIOUS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. OVER TWO THOUSAND THIRTY TWO FIRE ENGINES ONE HUNDRED SIXTY BULLDOZERS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HAND CREWS. WERE ALL DEPLOYED ACROSS THE SPIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN PLACE AND THE COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS BOTH ON. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE DEPARTMENT AND ASSISTING AGENCIES TO MAKE OF THE EVENTS SUCCESSFUL ALLOW US TO MITIGATE THE THREAT IN AND DAMAGE OF THESE FIRES. WE OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE TO DO SO FROM TWENTY ONE VARIOUS STATES OF THE FARTHEST BEING ALASKA IN NORTH CAROLINA. IN ADDITION TO THE FOR A OCTOBER FIRES THAT WE'VE HIT ON BRIEFLY IN YOUR OPENING. THE. THOMAS FIRE BECAME THE SEVENTH MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDLAND FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AS WELL. WITH THE ONE THOUSAND SIXTY THREE STRUCTURES THAT WERE BURNED. NOW BESIDES THE. FIRE ENGINES IN THE BULLDOZERS AND THE HAND CREWS THAT WERE DEPLOYED. WE DEPLOYED ONE HUNDRED TWO AIRCRAFT OVER THOSE FIRES. FOR THAT. ONE TO TWO WEEK PERIOD AND ONGOING ACTUALLY INTO THE END OF DECEMBER. FOR THE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THE AIR TANKERS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SIX. HOURS WERE PUT ON AIR TANKERS AND OVER ONE. POINT THREE MILLION GALLONS OF FIRE RETARDANT WERE DROPPED ON THE VARIOUS FIRES. MOST THAT BEING ON THE THOMAS FIRE. A HELICOPTER HOURS. WE PUT OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN HOURS. ON HELICOPTERS DELIVERING WATER IN RETARDANT TO VARIOUS FIRES ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DROPPING. ONE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR GALLONS OF WATER. AS WE CONTINUED ON AND ENTERED INTO THE. END OF DECEMBER CROSS ALL THESE FIRES WE HAD. FIRE SUPPRESSION REPAIR CREWS WORKING ON THE VARIETY OF FIRES PUTTING IN WATER BARS RE HAVING. FIRE LINES. WHEN THE FIRES WERE MITIGATED IN ANY A CONTAINMENT STATE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY. WE EXPERIENCED ANOTHER EVENT. AS WE APPROACH THE FIRST OF JANUARY I SPECIFICALLY BELIEVERS JANUARY NINTH. WHERE THOSE EFFORTS HAD TO SHIFT DUE TO? MUD FLOW AND DEBRIS FLOWS. BUT THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO SPECIFIC TO THOSE MUD FLOWS IS A REFER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON EITHER SIDE OF ME TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER. UP BUT THERE'S MUD FLOWS THAT WERE PARTIALLY CREATED BY THE A SCORCHED SOIL. AND I DO TO THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED. THEY WERE UNABLE TO ABSORB THE MORE THAN FIVE POINT FIVE INCHES OF RAIN THAT HAD FALLEN IN THE COURSE OF ONLY TWO DAYS. THE LACK OF VEGETATION ALLOWED THESE INCREASED RATES OF EROSION. ULTIMATELY LEADING TO A CATASTROPHIC FLOODING IN THE DEVASTATING MUD SLIDES THAT THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN JANUARY. I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. LET ME PLEASE MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THE OTHER TWO SPEAKERS IN AND THEN WE CAN GO TO THE Q. AND A. THAT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE. MYSTERY DINNER MISTER TAYLOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN TAYLOR I'M THE DIVISION CHIEF OPERATIONS FOR THEM ON A SEATO FIRE DEPARTMENT IN SANTA BARBARA. AND I WAS ONE OF THE UNIFIED INCIDENT COMMANDERS FOR THE ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW EVENT. WHEN I TALK TO YOU VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT TWO TOPICS THE FIRST BEING THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES. AND THE SECOND BEING COMMUNICATION NETWORKS USE BY EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. IN ADVANCE OF THE ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW ON JANUARY EIGHTH. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY PRE POSITIONED SEVERAL RESOURCES INCLUDING OUR LOCAL TYPE THREE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM. COMPLETELY AND FULLY ACTIVATED THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. EVERY FRONT COUNTRY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS A HUNDRED PERCENT STAFFED WITH ALL OF THEIR RESOURCES. SEVERAL AMBULANCES WERE ADDED TO THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM. SHERIFFS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE FULLY STAFFED. OR FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. HAD FOLKS WORKING ON THE DEBRIS BASINS AND WE HAD ASSISTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH. RTS AND SWIFT WATER FLOOD RESCUE TEAMS. NOW AS YOU KNOW ON THE NINTH THIS TRAGIC DEBRIS FLOW RESULTED IN TWENTY THREE FOR TALENT IS IN OUR COMMUNITY. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR RESIDENCES DESTROYED. AND ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED DAMAGED. BECAUSE OF THIS PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES HOWEVER EIGHT HUNDRED OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE RESCUED DURING THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT THE EVENT. IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THAT PRE POSITIONING. EVERYONE THEY CAME TO ASSIST BEFORE THE DEBRIS FLOW CAME UNDER THE MASTER MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR. WITH NO EXPECTATION OF REIMBURSEMENT. DEBRIS FLOWS IN MONTICELLO AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ARE THREE TO FIVE YEAR THREAT. WELL THE WATERSHED. REGROWSAND REPAIRS ITSELF. AND SO WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TO DO THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN OUR COMMUNITY. MASTER MUTUAL AID IS MOST LIKELY NOT ASSISTING NOBLE WAY TO DO THIS. SO THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION REQUESTED. BY THE DISASTER READINESS AND SAFE AND SAFER COMMUNITIES WOULD PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT. BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FIRE AND RESCUE BRANCH IN ADVANCE OF THE STORMS. OR IN ADVANCE OF WEATHER EVENTS FOR WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FIRES. NOW MOVING ON TO THE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS. THERE WERE UTILIZED IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE THE FIRST NOT PROGRAM. WILL PROVIDE ABOUT A THOUSAND CELLULAR SITES IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION. WHICH WILL PROVIDE US WITH FASTER CONNECTIONS AND MORE BANDWIDTH IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY. SPECTRUM. THE IMPORTANCE OF BAND WITH US IS IT IMPROVES OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. ALLOWING US TO DEVELOP A COMMON OPERATING PICTURE AND ULTIMATELY BECOME INTER OPERABLE. THIS STARTS IN A DEBRIS FLOW EVENT WITH THE WEATHER FORECAST. A LOT OF DECISIONS ARE MADE IN ADVANCE OF THE EMERGENCY BASED UPON WHAT THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS FORECASTING. SPECIFICALLY THE RAIN INTENSITY. THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO HELP OUR LOCAL SHERIFF'S OFFICE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH EVACUATION TRACKING. EVACUATION COMPLIANCE. AND MAY POTENTIALLY ALERT RESCUERS WHERE THEY NEED TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS IF A DEGREE FOR WORKERS. IT COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY CREATE A SITUATION WHERE EVACUEES COULD SELF REPORT THEIR LOCATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. IT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEARN THE DEBRIS BASIN STATUS AT THE TIME OF THE ACTUAL EVENT WITH LITTLE OR NO RISK TO RESPONDERS. TODAY THAT REQUIRES A HUMAN TO WALK UP THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT THE STATUS IS. AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP US WITH OUR POLICEMEN AIRY DEBRIS FLOW DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO MORE ACCURATELY FOCUS OUR SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORTS ON THOSE AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED. AS OPPOSED TO THOSE AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD NOT BE. IT WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH SHOULD WE JEWS ARE REFLEX TIME. AND IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT AND COORDINATE THE RESPONSE ON THE GROUND. AND THEN FINALLY THESE TECHNOLOGIES WOULD ALLOW US TO USE BOTH VIDEO AND FORWARD LOOKING INFRARED DRONE TECHNOLOGY. TO MORE CLEARLY DEFINE THE CURRENT SITUATION. THE SYSTEM CREATES RESILIENCY AND REDUNDANCY. AND MAY ALSO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NINE ONE ONE CELLULAR CALL ROUTING. THE RECALL CHIEF MCELROY FROM SANTA BARBARA FIRE DEPARTMENT ALERTED THIS GROUP TO SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. THIS IS WHERE THE EMERGENCY CALL FROM THE CELLPHONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY END UP AT THE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT. WHICH DELAYS ARE RESPONSE. SO IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES WAS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS IN THE ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW EVENT. AND REMAINS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LOCAL PLANS MOVING FORWARD. MASTER MUTUAL AID IS THE SOLUTION TODAY BUT MOST LIKELY NOSSOS DENOBLE. AND THEN SAY THAT FIRST THAT WILL PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY DESIGNATED BAND WITH WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. AND INTER OPERABILITY WHICH IN THE END WILL PROVIDE OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A MORE EFFECTIVE. AND EFFICIENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY OF THESE LARGE DISASTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR MISTER NAME PLEASE. MANY MEMBERS MY NAME SHIFTING THEM SHARP COUNTY I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO ACTUALLY CENTER JACKSON THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE. NOW YOU'VE BEEN DEEPLY IMBEDDED. WITH THE THOMAS FIRE SINCE ITS BEGINNING. TO TYLER TALK ABOUT WHEN THAT FIRE STARTED SANTA POLLACK INTO A I WAS THERE SEVEN PM STANDING SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY FIRE DEPARTMENT BROTHER AND. AS WE LOOK THIS FIRE AND. BEING A COP LIKE GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO PAY ATTENTION WHAT FIREMAN SAY. BUT WHEN THE THAT THE TIME SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID WE NEED TO EVACUATE UP FOR ALL HIGH. AND THE CITY OF VENTURA. THANK HEAVENS WE LISTEN TO ON THAT NIGHT. I'M THERE'D BE A LOT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION OUT PERSON THAT IN EIGHTEEN THE PEOPLE HERE SOME EXPERTS IS HIGHER. BUDGET TALK ABOUT IT BUT I THINK YOU TO REAP BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T DISCUSS COMMUNICATIONS TO OUR CITIZENS THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY OUR NEIGHBORS OUR FAMILIES. AND HOW WE SAVE LIVES A MENTOR COUNTY WE'RE VERY PRIVILEGED THROUGH HARD WORK I'D HAVE A MULTI TIERED REALLY REALLY EFFECTIVE. A NOTIFICATION SYSTEM WE USE FOR DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THE FIRST ONE IS THE SYSTEM WE CALL VC ALERT WHICH IS A THIRD PARTY VENDOR CALLED EVER BRIDGE. DURING THE THOMAS FAR WE MADE NOTIFICATIONS TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT A NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. SUCCESS RATE. NOW THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE GO IN AND SIGN UP FOR THEMSELVES. SOME SOME COUNTIES CALLED REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SOME DON'T HAVE ANY SYSTEM BUT IT'S THERE THE PROBLEM AS YOU NEED PEOPLE TO GO SIGN UP FOR IT. SO IN MY COUNTY I'VE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP OUT OF MY EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. CONDITION THAT I BY THE NINE ONE ONE DATA. WHICH GIVES ME ANOTHER COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE OF DATA. HOW MANY OF YOU ANSWER YOUR PHONE HOME? THAT'S WHAT NINE ONE ONE DATA IS. SO. WHAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH CELL PHONE PROVIDERS IF WE GET ACCESS TO CELL PHONE DATA GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO ME ANY GOOD TO HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER IF IT'S NOT BASED YOUR ADDRESS. BECAUSE OUR SURGICAL SURGED SURGICAL NOTIFICATION PROCESS RIGHT CONTROL LINE AROUND ONE HOUSE TO AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD TO ENTIRE CITY IS BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHIC NOTIFICATION. AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL WHETHER IT BE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. WHETHER IT BE AN EXPLOSION A CHEMICAL EXPLOSION WHETHER BE A FIRE WE DON'T HAVE TO USE THE WIDE AREA NETWORK SYSTEM. SO AS A FOLLOW UP TO OUR LOCAL AREA NOTIFICATION DURING THE THOMAS FAR WE DID TO WIDE AREA NOTIFICATIONS WHICH TOUCHED ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. NOW IS YOU AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE PREACHING THE CHORUS YOU KNOW THAT GOES TO A PRIVATE THE PRIVATE CELLPHONE CARRIERS AND IT GOES TO THE CLOSEST CELLPHONE TOWER. SO THEY COVER THE AREA THAT WE WANT BUT THEY ALSO COVER A BROADER SPECTRUM. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THE NOTIFICATION THAT THEY REALLY DON'T NEED TO HAVE AND YOU GET ALERT FATIGUE IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN THE CELL PHONE CALLS YOU GET. THAT FROM VENDORS AFTER WHILE YOU YOU YOU JUST DON'T PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE IS NOT SPECIFIC TO YOUR AREA. IF WE CAN ENHANCE BY HAVING CELL PHONE DATA IN OUR NERD IN OUR IN OUR SURGICAL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. IT WOULD REALLY REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE I THINK YOU SAVE LIVES BY. BEING SPECIFIC WHEN YOU NOTIFY PEOPLE GIVING THEM THE EXACT INFORMATION. AND NOT OVERWHELMING THEM WITH WIDE AREA NOTIFICATIONS SO WE WE USE A LOCAL SURGICAL SYSTEM WHERE YOU WE USE THE WIDE AREA NETWORK WE USE OUR EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM. WHICH IS FOR THOSE OF US BEEN AROUND AWHILE ECOSPHERE LOCAL RADIO STATIONS AND TO NOTIFY PEOPLE WITH THE LOCAL MEDIA ON. OUR UNSEEN WITH US THE QEII Y. RETOOK REPORTER OUT OF SENATE WORRY WAS THERE. VIRTUALLY EVERY MINUTE WITH US AND ON TOP OF THAT WE SEND FIRST RESPONDERS OUT TO KNOCK ON DOORS. NOW AYE AYE SIR ICED IT MOMENTS TALKING TO THAT SECTOR OF HOMELAND DEFENSE ABOUT THIS I SAID WE'RE LUCKY. THAT WE ONLY HAD TWO DEATHS IN OUR FIRE CHIEF CORRECTED MEMBER CURRENCIES WHO WEREN'T LUCKY. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE A WELL REHEARSED SOPHISTICATED. PROGRAM THAT REALLY REALLY WORKS NOW HE ALWAYS WANT NO DESKS OR TWO DEATHS WERE A WOMAN EVACUATING ON A CAR ACCIDENT. AND THEN SADLY COREY COREY IVERSON OUR HERO FIREFIGHTER WHO DIED FIGHTING THE FIRE. I WAS PRETTY DANG HAPPY WITHOUT. WE LOST A THOUSAND STRUCTURES ALONE LOST TWO LIVES AND PART OF IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ACCURATELY. AND SURGICALLY TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND NOT OVERWHELM THEM WITH ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATIONS THAT THAT MAY NOT. PAY ATTENTION TO. SO IF THERE'S LEGISLATION. TO GET PEOPLE TO OPT IN TO GET CELLPHONE CARRIERS TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT INFORMATION AND I REALIZE HIS PRIVACY ISSUES WE HAVE THE NINE ONE ONE DATA FOR HOME PHONES WE HOPE THERE'S A WAY TO WORK AROUND THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH THE F. FEDERAL SHE SHE IS WORKING ON A READY. JUST ALLOW US TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS WERE ALLOWED TO PUT OUT INNOCENT APPLICATIONS BECAUSE WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF CHARACTERS. YOU CAN'T GIVE DETAILED INFORMATION AND YOU PUT OUT A MESSAGE SAYS THERE'S A DISASTER. AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WHAT IT'S FOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. AND THEN BE ENOUGH PEOPLE TALKING AS MY BROTHERS HERE OF TALK ABOUT A PERSON AT SO I WON'T EVEN. DISCUSS THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER DEAN AND. OPENED UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THERE ANY RUSSIANS. I'M SURE. THANK YOU SHERIFF DEAN ACTUALLY HAVE A BILL ON CHOSE THIS SUBJECT BASED UPON THE HEARING WE HAD BEFORE THE FIRE AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED IT'S AN. I SP EIGHT TWENTY ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A AN OPT OF AN OPT IN SYSTEM. COUNTIES CAN OFTEN FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN THEN IF THEY DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY CAN OPT OUT BUT IT'S GOING TO GIVE. I COUNTY SEE OPPORTUNITY TO GET PEOPLE ON THAT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM RATHER THAN PEOPLE HAVE TO FIRST KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM EXISTS THEN TAKE THE AFFIRMATIVE STEP TO OPT IN. THEMSELVES THIS WAY WE KNOW AS YOU'VE INDICATED IT WILL SAVE LIVES SO I APPRECIATE THAT PLUG FOR S. B. A TWENTY ONE. UNKNOWING ESTIMATE BEEN. BUT. PERHAPS WE WERE CHANNELING THAT THE IDF AS A RESULT THE LAST HEARING I DID HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I COULD FOR. DEPUTY TIE A TYLER. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU PUT TO. A HUNDRED. IT WAS SHIPPED ONE POINT THREE MILLION GALLONS OF FIRE RETARDANT. I SAW SOME OF THAT. OF ITS KIND OF PINK. IT LOOKS REALLY WEIRD ON TREES BUT I KNOW THAT IT DID HELP SAVE A LOT OF I AM CURIOUS FROM BURNING UP PARTICULARLY IN THE. THE MONTECITO WARY AND THERE WAS SOME INVENTORY IF I RECALL CORRECTLY. THAT'S A LOT OF. FIRE RETARDANT COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS ARE IS THE SOFT TOXIC. AS IT SORT OF SWEPT DOWN THE THE HILLSIDES WITH THE THE. WOULD WE CALL THAT OF MUCH LIKE WE CALLED THE WITH NINE THE ONE NINE. MY DEBRIS INCIDENT WERE TRYING TO READ THAT REPURPOSE THE NAME SO. OF THE IT'S. ONE THAT DOESN'T COME EASILY TO MY LIPS SO. CHIEF TYLER WHAT WHAT TAYLOR WHAT WE CALL THIS THE MONEY ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW ONE NINE TO REFILL THAT'S THAT MUCH MUDSLIDES AND MOAN SEAT WANTING TO BRIEF. WHAT WHAT IS THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF OF THAT? FIRE RETARDANT BEING IN THE. COMMUNITY. SO CSUS SPECIFICALLY AT THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS CAME ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FIRE RETARDANTS BOTH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE. WERE DROPPED. LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT A SECRET DOCUMENTS A LOT OF ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE ON FIRE RETARDANT AND THERE IS CONCERN. BROADLY OF BY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT TO ITS CHEMICAL COMPONENTS AND WHAT IT MIGHT DO TO THE ENVIRONMENT. UP THERE IS A SPECIFIC. INTER AGENCY AIR TAKE IMPORTANT FAR CHEMICALS. ORGANIZATIONS WHO FOR SERVICE THE CAL FIRE TAKES PART IN IN. MISSOULA MONTANA THAT EVALUATES FAR CHEMICALS AND THEY ALSO EVALUATE THEM FOR THEIR TOXICITY TO THE COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY A FIRE RETARDANT FOR THE MOST PART IS MADE UP. A PRIMARILY OF WATER WITH EIGHT GUMMING AGENT AND APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT. NITROGEN COMPONENT THAT YOU WOULD FIND IN A NORMAL LAWN FERTILIZER. HAS A GUMMING AGENT THAT'S INCLUDED WITHIN THAT FERTILIZER. WITHIN THAT WITH THAT IN THAT RETARDANT. AND IT HAS THAT RED DYE IN IT. NOT BECAUSE THAT IS THE MAKE UP OF THE RETARDANT ITSELF BUT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE RED DYE IS SO. THE AIR TACTICAL GROUP SUPERVISOR THE AIR TANKER PILOTS. AND THE. AND THE HELICOPTER PILOTS CAN SEE WHERE THEY HAVE DROPPED THE RETARDANT. WHILE THEY'RE FLYING IN THE AIR. AGAIN MADE UP OF APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT. OF NITROGEN AGAIN THE SAME CALLED CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT YOU SEE AND FERTILIZER. AND WE HAVE FOUND. HISTORICALLY THAT. THROUGH DILUTION OR OTHERWISE THEREIN NO CHEMICAL ILL EFFECTS OF FIRE RETARDANT. TO COMMUNITIES. I'M SURE SOME OF MY ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDS WOULD HAVE A RESPONSE BUT I'LL BE SURE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LAST QUESTION AND FOR ALL FOR EACH OF THE PANELISTS BASED UPON YOUR EXPERIENCES. DID ANY OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS EXPERIENCE ANY INTER OPERABILITY PROBLEMS OR COMMUNICATIONS DIFFICULTIES. DURING ANY OF THESE. EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THAT THE THOMAS FIVE. THE SENATE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FORTY YEARS AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS ARTICULAR BOUNCING OFF SATELLITES OR WHAT IT AS I AM VENTURA COUNTY UBER WERE REAL LUCKY WE CAN TALK TO EVERYBODY. ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN TALK MY AGENCY WE CAN TALK TO FIRE BUT THEY'RE STILL PROBLEMS HE JUST AYE IN ACCOUNT ANY BOUNCE OFF A MOUNTAIN. WERE IS IT SO THERE'S NO PERFECT SOLUTION IN OUR COUNTY BECAUSE. WE WERE LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER COMMUNICATE. COMMUNICATION LIES IT ACTUALLY WENT FAIRLY WELL AND I KNOW OUR FIRE DISTRICTS WERE CLOSE WITH LOS ANGELES A LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO REMEDY THEIR. OUR INNER BORDER ISSUES THAT. HAVE BEEN PRESENT THE PAST. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FIRST THAT WILL CERTAINLY ENHANCE THAT. I GUESS THAT'S THE. WHAT IS IT WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE I MEAN THERE HAVE TO BE SOME POSITIVE SIDE OF THESE THINGS LIKE LESSONS LEARNED WHAT WE DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE TO? CALL UPON THOSE KINDS OF COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. SIR TYLER I WOULD CONCUR RICHARD DEAN. WE DID NOT SEE THE. LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION ISSUES. IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES AS WE SAW IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE A SAILOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE SAILOR TOWERS WERE DISABLED AND OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY. BECAME LESS AVAILABLE IT IS IMPORTANT NOTES. IN. IN OUR ICS ORGANIZATION OR INCIDENT COMMAND ORGANIZATION THAT. THROUGHOUT THE INCIDENT WELL I THINK I WOULD WELL I WOULD THINK I'D REACT I CONCUR WITH SHIFTING THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTY IN ITS. GENERALLY A GEOGRAPHIC TOPOGRAPHIC IN NATURE. IN OUR INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOGISTICS SECTION CHIEFS AND SPECIFICALLY COMMUNICATION UNIT LEADERS. THAT WE BRING IN MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS. MANY AGENCIES SHARE OF FIRE. O. YES. ALL HAVE THESE CAPABILITIES WITH THAT. WE CAN REACH OUT THROUGH THE ORDERING SYSTEMS AND ORDER ADDITIONAL FREQUENCIES SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER DOWN WILDLAND FIRES. IN THESE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS WE HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF SATELLITE TELEPHONES AND PORTABLE REPEATERS AS WE FIND. GEOGRAPHIC AND TOOK A GRAPHIC DIFFICULTIES WE CAN PLACE A PORTABLE REPEATERS AREA THEN PROVE THAT. THAT COVERAGE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THOSE PORTABLE REPEATERS WE CAN ALWAYS PUT A HUMAN REPEATER IN A SAFE LOCATION. WHO CAN RELAY INFORMATION SO? ENCLOSING A EVERY INCIDENT WILL HAVE SOME LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTY IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES THEY WERE. NOT LIKE WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AND. THANK YOU I WILL FOLLOW PUSHING HIS SHIRT COLLAR STATEMENT JUST NOW BUT ALLOWS RESOURCES COMING AFTER THE FACT SO THE INITIAL STRIKE WAS GOING ON IN. THIS RESPONSE COME OUT BILLS BOAT MEDICATIONS ARE GREAT BUT THOSE COME IN AFTER THE FACT THEY ARE. NOT INITIAL SIX OR SEVEN HOURS NEEDS INITIALLY TAKES PLACE. YES SIR I WOULD OCCUR FOR FOR CAL FIRE SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE SIX MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS LOCATED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND AT GENERALLY YOU WILL NOT PROBABLY SEE THOSE WITHIN THE FIRST ONE. THANK YOU LET ME JUMP TO MISTER RODRIQUEZ HER QUESTION AND BACK TO. MISTER COOPER. WHICH WERE KEVIN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PRE POSITIONING OF OUR RESOURCES HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH THE. THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES YOU NEED WHEN YOU PRE POSITION FOR WHETHER IT'S THE THE FIRES REPAIR FOR THE SANTA ANAS OR. THE FLOODS IN THIS CASE ABOUT WHAT WOULD YOU BASED ON TOP RESOURCE YOU NEED FOR THOSE TYPES OF. PREPAREDNESS OF THAT WOULD OCCUR ON BASIN ON. SO MISTER RODRIGUEZ WE UTILIZE. DECISION MAKING MATRIX ESSENTIALLY EVALUATES WHAT THE WEATHER FORECAST IS. THE VALUES THAT RISK IN THE CASE OF A FIRE PREVIOUS FIRE BEHAVIOR IN THE CASE THAT OF OF A DEBRIS FLOW THE REPORT ON THE DAMAGE TO THE WATERSHED. AND OUT THE OTHER END OF THAT COMES A PRE FIRE PLAN IF YOU WILL ARE PRE INCIDENT PLAN. THE PRE INCIDENT PLAN GENERALLY WILL IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF RESOURCES THE TYPE OF RESOURCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REQUIRED TO MANAGE THEM AND WHERE THEY ARE MOST EFFECTIVE REPLETE DEPORT. PRE DEPLOYED. SCUBA NEEDS TO HAVE A QUESTION. ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. WHEN. METROPOLITAN AND I ASSUME THAT THAT THERE WAS YOU HAD BASICALLY RESPONSE THAT I'M JUST CURIOUS TO WE KNOW. THE BECAUSE OF THE SIX FIRES THAT OCCURRED. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON DECEMBER FOURTH AND FIFTH. AND IF NOT WHAT WHAT'S THE TIMELINE BY WHICH. WE CAN EXPECT TO KNOW WHAT THE CAUSES WERE OF THOSE FIRES. SO I CAN. I CAN SPEAK TO. AT LEAST. FOUR OF THE SIX FIRES AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO FOUR OF THE SIX FIRES BECAUSE. OF FOUR OF THOSE FIRES WERE WITHIN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. OF A OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THE OTHER ONES WERE. LOCATED THE CITY MARIETTA IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND I BELIEVE. THEIR INVESTIGATORS. MAY HAVE COME UP THE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE CAUSES WERE ON THOSE INCIDENTS FOR THE FOUR REMAINING THAT I CAN SPEAK TO. WE ACTIVELY HAVE A FIRE INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE COLLECTING DATA FROM. VARIOUS SOURCES AND. THEIR ORIGIN AND CAUSE INVESTIGATION. THE A DIRECTOR PELLATT CONTINUES TO GET TO A REGULAR UPDATES FROM THOSE INVESTIGATORS WE HOPE THAT. WE WILL SEE. THOSE CAUSES. BE RELEASED THAT RELATIVELY SOON. A MONTH TWO MONTHS WHAT'S RELATIVELY SOON. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ARE ON THE LONG SIDE MAYBE TWO MONTHS. SO ANY. THAT'S ON THE LONG SIDE. THANK YOU. MR GRUBER IT I DON'T OUT SELF YEARS HIS WORK WITH THE I. O. U.'S TOOK TO CUT POWER OFF. IN SOME AREAS WHEN THEY HAVE. STRONG WINDS OF FIRES SPECIAL DOWN SOUTH BUT WE DON'T DO APPEAR THAT'S ONE THING THAT NOW WE'RE GOOD AT IS INCONSISTENCY NOT I'M TALKING EVERYONE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. WERE STATE WHAT SHOULD BE FOR A CUP POWER OFF WHICH YOU LIVE HAVE HIGHWAYS THAT SHOULD BE A STELLAR EVERYWHERE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO OFTEN HEAR THINGS AFTER THE FACT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO THAT. P. JESUS AND DO APPEAR IN IT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW POSSIBLY IN PLANO TACTICS. WALLET WOODS INTERVIEWS TO CONSUMERS OBVIOUSLY IT DIFLUCAN SAVE LIVES. SO THERE IS YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT AND MAYBE A STATEWIDE POLICY. WE DO HAVE HIGH WINTER IN FIRES TAKE OFF. WE WE TALK ABOUT. LESSONS LEARNED THESE ARE ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT. THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CPU SEE AS WELL AS THE. UTILITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO. EVALUATE THIS PROCESS IS AND PERHAPS STANDARDIZE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE IS HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN CUT SO I'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT IT AS A RESULT THESE FIRES. SO HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN CUTTING OUT THE POWER DOWN SOUTH. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER. I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. ASSUMING RECORDS I JUST HAVING LIVE THERE IT'S. GENERALLY DRIVEN BY AN INCIDENT AND POST INCIDENT AND POST INCIDENT LITIGATION. SO AFTER THE THOMAS FIRE I THINK THEY. YOU KNOW EDISON COULD SAY FOR SURE BUT I THINK THEY'VE CUT OUR POWER THREE DIFFERENT TIMES A BEFORE THAT I CAN REMEMBER WHEN. THAT'S GREAT I MEAN WE SHOULD DO IT I THINK SHOULD BE SOMETIME A STANDARD. THAT WE CAN A PLAYER POSSIBLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHAT I I DO GO QUICK A QUICK QUESTION AND YOU'VE TOUCHED UPON A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANTED TO MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND ANSWERED YOU AN ANSWER TO HAVE ALWAYS WHAT YOU SHOULD YOU DO I'M SORRY WHAT DID YOU DO AND IN WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY. AND I'LL START OFF AND BY STATING NAPA. BUT WHAT I'M GOING AFTER IS SO. THESE FIRES HAVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THEM. EIGHT. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DID DIFFERENTLY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A WHAT IS IT? GENERALLY I COULD'VE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY. AS IT RELATES TO. COMMUNICATION. AND NOTIFICATION THE OF THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE THERE'S TWO THINGS OUT THAT I'M LOOKING FOR THEIR RIGHT WILL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID DO. AND. WHAT COULD BE DONE BEYOND AND IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REDUNDANCY AS WELL? I APPRECIATE THAT. YEAH I'M NOT ELISE INVENTOR COUNTY I DON'T THINK WE DID MUCH DIFFERENT AFTER. THAT THE FIRES IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I GET SO ONE THE LESSONS WE LEARNED IS. PUTTING OUT IN SPANISH LANGUAGE WE USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE. AND. BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST WE HAD AND WE HAVE SO MANY DIALECTS A MENTOR COUNTY THAT THE NUMBERS WEREN'T. THAT THAT LANGUAGE WASN'T TRANSPOSE PROPERLY AND AFTER THAT WE HAD INTERPRETED IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THAT I KNOW THERE'S SOME LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN IS. OFTEN TIMES. WERE AT THE BACK FOR A PATROL CAR FIRE ENGINE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WE HAVE TO GET A MESSAGE OUT WITHIN THREE MINUTES. AND THERE ISN'T TIME TO HIRE A TRANSLATOR SO COST IT TAKES ME GIVE IT TO SEND THAT OUT TO ACCOMPANY A CONTRACT WITH. COST ME A HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS AN HOUR PLUS TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR FOR THE TURN AROUND. IF WERE OUT ON THE SCENE THEN WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEND SOMETHING OUT INSTANTLY OTHERWISE LIGHTS ARE GONNA BE AT REST SO WHAT WHAT IS THAT BALANCE SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A LESSON I LEARNED THAT WAY. I'M WE OPEN UP A TWENTY FOUR HOUR CALL CENTER IN OUR EOC. AND OUR WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE TO CALL IN AND ASK QUESTIONS I CLARIFY ON OUR NOTIFICATIONS. SO THAT WORKED WELL FOR US AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T DONE BEFORE THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO DO. THANK YOUNG OF HIS ANY OTHER EXAMPLES. I CAN TELL YOU IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE COMPLETELY REDID OUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEM BASED UPON OUR FIRST DEBRIS FLOW TOURISTS TO. A CURRENT TODAY SO WE WENT FROM A IMMEDIATE EVACUATION ORDER TWO MORE OF A SEVENTY TWO HOUR. A PRE EVACUATION ADVISORY FOLLOWED BY A RECOMMENDED EVACUATION WARNING AND THEN ULTIMATELY BECOMING A MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDER. SO WE FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ALERT THE COMMUNITY TO THE FORECAST EVENTS. AND THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE OR THE LESSON LEARNED IF YOU WILL. DOING TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT AVENUES TO USE TO COMMUNICATE WITH FOLKS. I CERTAINLY WE USE THE SAME AVENUES AS EVERYONE ELSE SO OUR PRIMARY TOOL IS THE EVER BRIDGE. WE CALL IT THEY ARE READY S. B. C. DOT ORG IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT A SENATOR JACKSON INDICATED IS A REQUIRES PEOPLE OFTEN. SO DESPITE A FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE EIGHTEEN MONTH IN A CAMPAIGN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY WE STILL SEE FAIRLY LOW NUMBERS. HE AND MY DAD IF THE STATE WAS LOOKING TO DO SOMETHING. FOR CONSISTENCY. WHILE EVERY COUNTY HAS ITS OWN CULTURE AND HOW THEY DO IT AND I THINK LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES SHOULD DICTATE THAT. USING THE SAME NO NOMENCLATURE AS TO WHAT IS IT IN A VOLUNTARY EVACUATION RESIDENT ADVISORY. ESPECIALLY NEAR BORDERING COUNTIES MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND WHILE THEY'RE CERTAINLY BE SOME DISCUSSION AMONGST ALL THE THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THOSE INVOLVED I THINK YOU COULD COME TO SOME CONSENSUS SO AT LEAST EVERYBODY WAS TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GONNA HAVE A CONSENSUS OR THAT YOU SHOULD ON WHEN THE NOTIFICATION SHOULD ACTUALLY GO OUT. MR GRUBER. I SET MYSELF TO SOME RESEARCH IN IT IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST DE ENERGIZE POLLY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WAS THE FIRST INCIDENT HERE WE ARE SIX YEARS LATER IN EIGHTEEN AND I GUESS. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR THE PC TO MAKE A DECISION THAT MAYBE TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD GOT A FIRE SEASON COMING UP IT'S GONNA BE DRY AGAIN. SO THERE IS THE EMPHASIS TO ME FOR SOME. FIRST TO GET GOING ON THAT AND AND MAKE IT A STANDARD OBVIOUSLY. EACH SCENARIOS DIFFERENT AND DICTATES WHAT COULD HAPPEN AS FAR AS I KNOW WHEN AND WHETHER YOU MIDI FIRE SO. TO ME THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. SOONER THAN THE LATER KNOWN THE WAY THE STATE GOVERNMENT WORKS IT COULD BE TWO YEARS FROM NOW FOR THE DECISION ON THAT SO SO HOW DO WE GET THERE. WITH YOU GUYS IN THE OF UTILITIES I USE I TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM THAT WE CAN PLAY THIS SUMMER. IF YOU SUB FIRES HAPPEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. GIVING USERS UP HERE YET HOW DO WE GET THERE THIS SUMMER. SO MISTER COOPER THAT. ALL I CAN IMPRESS UPON YOU AT THIS MOMENT IS THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING THROUGH EMMA USING RELATIONS CONTINUING TO BUILD WITH TO SEE IF YOU SEE WE ARE MEETING WITH. THE HIGHEST EVEL EXECUTIVES OF. SOME OF THE THREE MAJOR A UTILITY COMPANIES THIS WEEK TO TALK ABOUT THE LESSONS LEARNED A LOT OF THOSE ITEMS ARE SO WE'RE MEETING WITH THEM ON FRIDAY. IN THESE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE SUBJECTS OF DISCUSSION. YES WERE FIRST RESPONDERS YOUR FIRST RESPONDERS SO THAT TRUMP'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS IN. THIS ISSUE PC IS VERY SLOW. IN THEIR ACTIONS AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS SO I GUESS IF IT WE'VE CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO. GO ON PREVENT SOME THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN THIS SUMMER. WHICH IS A FEW SHORT MONTHS AWAY I WOULD SAY LET'S DO IT. SOMEHOW SOME WAY THAT'S THAT'S TO ME IS NOT A HEAVY LIFT. IF IF IT WANTS CONDITIONS AND I THINK COMMANDERS THERE AND FEELS BEST TO SHUT DOWN TO SAVE LIVES. WE SHOULD DO IT. I THINK YOU GUYS I WOULD SUPPORT OTHER PERSON THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE COMMANDER MAKES DECISION THE SUPPORT I THINK ALLEGE THERE WOULD DO. NO ONE SECOND GUESS YOU GUYS. SO IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF YOU NEED IF IT SAVES LIVES. AND SAVES RESIDENCES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SUPPORTIVE OF IT SO IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS THE PC LET US KNOW WHAT WE WANT TO HELP. I THINK THINK ESCOBAR I AM ALSO ONE POINT WITH A SPECIAL GUEST TODAY. MISLI MON WHO REPRESENTS THE AREA AND IS SITTING IN WITH US. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU. AS SINCE I WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY THANKING ALL OF YOU THAT WE'VE GOT INTO THAT WORK TOGETHER OVER AT. UNFORTUNATELY AT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS AND I WOULD ECHO. WHAT'S BEEN SAID THAT WE DID I IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION. UP BUT THERE WAS ALSO ANY MEDIA EFFORT TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND TO COME TO A SOLUTION I AND I THINK THAT. WHAT WE ABOUT AND ON THE? AND I ON THE FRIEND TO HAVE. KIND OF MAKING A DECISION ABOUT. A. ABOUT OUR ENERGY SUPPLY AND AND SO FORTH I I THINK I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT IT WAS. ON THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE THOMAS FIRE. AYE WHIZ AYE LIVE CASH HOW MANY MILES IS IT FROM. THE LEAD AFTER. SENATE PAULA. CDI. SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND I WAS. TWO AND I I THINK DIDN'T HAVE. THE POWER FOR SIX HOURS AND SO OUR ENTIRE HIGHER REGION. AND AND YOU KNOW I WAS IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY THAT OUR ENTIRE REGION. WAS DOWN IN TERMS OF POWER BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT. FROM THE POINT OF THE CONSTITUENTS. EVEN EVEN NOTICE IT IS REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT'S A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S IMPLICATIONS RELATED TO HEALTH PARTICULARLY THOSE. WHO HAVE HEALTH ISSUES WHO NEED SOME FORM OF POWER TO GET THEM THROUGH EACH HOUR? ON AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO PREPARE PEOPLE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY WE MAY BE DOWN. THE EXAMPLE REGRETTABLY THAT COMES TO MIND OVER AND OVER WAS. AND WHEN AT ONE POINT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE SIX DAYS AND THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE MESSAGING TO THE PUBLIC AND THE ANGST AROUND THAT. SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS OF LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN SIXTIES WITHOUT POWER AND HOW DO YOU PREPARE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW GET YOUR LITTLE BOX TOGETHER IMMEDIATE SIX DAYS. AND SO I THINK THAT WHATEVER WE CAN DO SO LONG AS IT'S ALSO INCLUDES A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN. TO THE BEST POSSIBLE I MEAN THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY THINGS DIDN'T GO RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS AN EMERGENCY. AND. AND I WONDER RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH AS HUMANS THAT WE CAN DO AND PREPARE FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY TRIED TO DO THAT. BUT IF THE COMMUNICATION PLAN AROUND OUR. OUR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INCLUDES KIND OF HELPING OUR CONSTITUENTS GET THROUGH THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I THINK AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AS PUBLIC SAFETY. ON WE WERE ALL FIGURED OUT BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS. I MEAN AS LONG AS THEIR CELLPHONES WERE STILL WORKING THERE EMAILING US AND CALLING US. ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN SO I THINK THAT WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO KEEP THEM ON WITH US AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PLAN AND THAT NO ONE WANTS SIX DAYS. I'M AND EVERYBODY WILL WORK REALLY HARD TO GET SEVEN SIXTIES WITHOUT A POWER THING THAT THAT WOULD BE USEFUL AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU ALL. HAVE DONE AND THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO BECAUSE THIS WAS INDEED AN EMERGENCY AND. THINGS WERE IN PERFECT IF WE ARE TO GO DOWN THAT THAT ROUTE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T FORGET THOSE PEOPLE THAT. ARE UNABLE TO MAYBE LEAVE OR RELOCATE. AND FOR THEM THE WANT TO STAY AT HOME. WITHOUT POWER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR HEALTH. THANK YOU I THINK THE PANELISTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. COMING TO THIS HEARING I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR SERVICE. I WANT TO GO ON TO THE NEXT. PANEL. WHICH WOULD BE FUTURE THREATS IMPLICATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'LL START OFF WITH. MISTER MIKE MY GUT. MY DOG* I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. MISTER CURRIER. FOLLOWED BY MISTER MARTINEZ. AND AGAIN WE'LL GO THROUGH A UP TO TEN MINUTES PER PERSON. I AFTER THAT WILL GOING TO Q. AND A AND THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MY NAME'S OUR NICHE MEDICAID WHICH I AM THAT IF THE TRACTOR AT THE COVERS OFF MUCH SERVICES. AND. WITH ME IS A BUNCH CAREER WHO'S ALSO WITH CAT CALLOWAY US HE'S OUR BRANCH MANAGER FOR A NINE ONE ONE. AND ALSO THE LEAD ARE FORTUNATE NEVERS AND SO. I WANNA SEE THANK YOU. TO THE MEMBERS HERE FOR ALLOWING US TO COME BACK IN. AND SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU AND TALK ABOUT. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US WHICH IS. PERSON AT AND WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND. THIS SIR IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT BUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS BROADBAND ACCESS TO US AS A AS A PRIMARY MEANS AND DEDICATED. SPECTRUM FOR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY. IS A IS ESSENTIAL AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO LEVERAGE THAT SPECTRUM FOR ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE BUILD OUT. THE. APPLICATIONS. THAT WILL. UNDOUBTEDLY UNFOLD FOR THEM AND AS YOU HEARD FROM THE FIRST PANEL. THAT WILL HELP THEM. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THEN I'LL DEFINITELY HELP US IN OUR A RESPONSE RECOVERY ACTIVITIES. SO IT'S A. SOMETHING THAT WERE. EXTREMELY EXCITED. TO SEE COME TO FRUITION. I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW WE ARRIVED HERE WHICH IS. WE. WE HAD A SERIES OF PUBLIC OUTREACHES AND ONE OF THE SLIDES WE JUST PASSED OUT TO HIS. ARM THAT THE OUTRAGE IS THAT WE ENGAGED IN UP AND DOWN THE STATE. I'M CAL YES. WAS PLEASE TO LEAD THAT EFFORT. IN ENSURE THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY HAD CHANCE TO COME OUT AND VOICE TO US EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED OR THE EXPECTED. AND WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES WERE. AS WE OWE MORE TO GO SHADING WITHOUT FIRST NET AND WITH EIGHTEEN T.. THIS ALLOWED US TO COMBINE ALL THOSE COMMENTS AND COME TOGETHER METHODICALLY AND DELIBERATELY AND BRING A. A GOOD. ANALYSIS FOR AS WE. BEGAN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WITH EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN PERSON AT. DURING THOSE OUTREACH EFFORTS OF BOTH EIGHTEEN DIVERSE THAT JOINED US AND IT GAVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR. A PER VERBALLY FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON AND FOR US TO HAVE A. GREAT OPEN DIALOGUE HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH A MORE PUBLIC OUTREACH. MOST OF OUR OF FIRE AND LAW AGENCIES EMS AGENCIES A MANY OF WHOM CAME OUT JOINT ASIDE DURING THOSE ARE EACH EFFORTS AND GAVE US A CHANCE TO. TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. IS THAT. FIRST IT IS HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE COMPONENT TO IT. HOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS? AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF FIRST MET IT'D BE OPERATIONAL IT PROVIDE THAT RESILIENCY IN PROVIDE THAT REDUNDANCY SO THAT OUR. FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY CAN DO THEIR TO THEIR JOBS AND WITHOUT THAT. IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL FOR US. FIRST NET IS NOT A PANACEA BY ITSELF IS A SINGLE TOOL ONE TOOL THE TOOL KIT FOR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITIES TO USE. BUT EVERY TOOL THAT THEY HAVE. BRINGS THEM TO A BETTER CHANCE FOR SUCCESS WINNER WHEN THEIR OPERATIONAL DEPLOYING AND SO WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THAT. I TODAY I BASS BUDGE. TO PRESENT TO YOU. GIVE YOU KIND OF A SHORT UPDATE AND SEE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TECHNICAL INTEGRATION IS OF FIRST NET BECAUSE I THINK WE IS A LOT OF TERMINOLOGY AROUND HERE AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO. UNDERSTAND HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE SEQUENCE WHERE THEY WERE WORKING ON HE'S GONNA WALK YOU QUICKLY THROUGH. TWO OF OUR GRAPHICS BUDGET. IT'S MY NAME IS BUDGET CARRIER ON THE NINE ONE BRANCH MANAGER WITH CALLAWAY ES NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NINE ONE NETWORK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS THE FIRST THAT DEPLOYMENT AND INTEGRATION THOSE TWO SOLUTIONS TOGETHER. SO BEFORE YOU HAVE A GRAPHIC WE'VE GOT IT HERE ON THIS. SLIDE TO THE FAR TO MY FAR RIGHT IT'S CALLED CONNECTING THE TECHNOLOGY. WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GRAPHIC IS TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DIFFERENT YET INTEGRATED? AND SO THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF MY TIME ON HIS NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE. SO THAT'S LOCATED IN KIND OF THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE DIAGRAM. SPOKE IS STUNNED GETTING THE INFORMATION AND THE DATA FROM THOSE WHO NEED HELP. INTO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THE HELP THEY NEED. SO THAT'S KIND OF BEEN IN GRASS PATH INTO THE AMERICAN C. RESPONSE SYSTEM. AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OUTREACH AND AND EFFORT. RELATED TO THAT MOVING FORWARD SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S RESILIENT AND REDUNDANT AND FUNDED PROPERLY SO ONCE IT ARRIVES AT THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT. THE NEXT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WOULD BE THE COMMUNICATION THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THAT PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT AND THOSE THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD RESPONDING. SO THERE'S BASICALLY TWO PADS THERE ONE IS MISSION CRITICAL VOICE. IT'S SHOWN ON THIS DIAGRAM IS LAND MOBILE RADIO SO THIS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ALOMAR LAND MOBILE RADIO TERMS OF THIS IS THE RADIOS AT THE USE FOR MISSION CRITICAL. VOICE COMMUNICATIONS AND A LOT OF THE INTER OPERABILITY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE CENTER AROUND THAT ABOUT HAVING CALM AND. VOICE CHANNELS TO TALK ONE TO ANOTHER AND. THAT WAS SOME SOME OF THE CONVERSATION IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THAT'S SYSTEMS BEEN IN PLACE A LONG TIME ITS HARDENED ITS PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE IT SURVIVES THROUGHOUT THESE DISASTERS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS AVAILABLE. AND WAS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT EACH OF THESE DISASTERS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. THE OTHER PIECE IN KIND OF THE CENTER OF THE DIAGRAM IS WHERE FIRST NIGHT IS. AND SO I'VE ALSO CALLED THAT BROADBAND SERVICES BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY THIS IS YOUR DATA CONNECTION FROM THOSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHO NEED THIS DATA. BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. SO THAT INFORMATION PRIMARILY INTERACTS WITH THEIR COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SO THIS IS THE DISPATCH SYSTEM THAT THEY USE TO SEND THE INFORMATION FROM THE DISPATCHER OUT TO THOSE IN THE FIELD. THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF FIRST NET NOW FIRST THAT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER. ADVANTAGES THAT WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT THAT'S THE PRIMARY PIECE. AND THEN ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THIS DIAGRAM YOU SEE ALERTS AND WARNINGS AND I'VE GOT THAT LITTLE CIRCLE DRAWN IN THERE UNDER. LOCAL AUTHORITY. THE LOCAL AUTHORITY MAKES THE DECISION ON HOW TO ISSUE THOSE AND AND YOU HEARD I SHARE FIFTEEN. TALK ABOUT HIS SOLUTIONS IN HIS COUNTY AND ON. DECEMBER FOURTH THAT LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF WAS HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE OVER THAT AND YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER. SO THAT'S THAT BOTTOM PIECE AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ARE IN THAT TOOLBOX AND EACH ONE HAS A SPECIFIC PURPOSE TO REACH A CERTAIN GROUP OF FOLKS. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS IT'S NOT FOLLOWING A REVERSE PATH THROUGH NINE ONE ONE EVEN THOUGH IT'S CALLED REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SOMETIMES. SO THERE IS A DISTINCTION ON THE PATH THAT IT TAKES TO GET BACK TO THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE WARNING. AND AND IT'S FAIRLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE NETWORKS ARE DIFFERENT. SO THIS IS HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE RELATED AND OBVIOUSLY AT THE SENATE ABOUT ALL THIS THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. THE NEXT GRAPHIC IS IS TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE ARE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE AND FIRST NOW SO THAT'S THE NEXT GRAPHIC. AND YOU'LL NOTICE PROBABLY IN THE CENTER OF THAT DIAGRAM THERE'S THIS WHITE BUBBLE THAT SAYS NEXT AND I'M ONE INTEGRATION TO FIRST NET THERE'S THIS INTEGRATION HAS TO HAPPEN. NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE WILL TAKE. DATA RICH INFORMATION FROM THOSE THAT NEED HELP AND SEND IT INTO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DESIGNING IT TO DO. FIRST NOT HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION A PUSH IT OUT TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONDER WHO MIGHT NEED THAT INFORMATION. THERE'S A CRITICAL CONNECTION HAS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THOSE TWO TECHNOLOGIES AT THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT. IS THAT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER GO THAT WE'RE UNDER UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW. YOU NOTICE IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER WE CAN HAVE TWO COLUMNS THERE OF WHAT FIRST NET IS TODAY RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S A ROLL OUT PLAN I KNOW THAT EIGHTEEN TO INFER CENTER PROBABLY GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT THERE'S SOME FEATURES THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE AVAILABLE ONE DAY AND THERE SOME FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO BECAUSE IT'S A ROLL OUT PLAN. THE OPTIM DECISION CAME IN DC ON DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH. AND SO% WERE FAIRLY NEW IN THIS PROCESS AND SO RIGHT NOW PRIORITY IN PREEMPTION. MEANING THAT IF THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER WHO SUBSCRIBE TO FIRST NET. THEY GET PRIORITY. ACCESS INTO THE NETWORK AND IF THAT CELL TOWERS CLOG PREEMPTION SAYS THEY GET HEAD OF THE LINE IN THE PUSH SOME OTHER LOWER PRIOR TO USE OUR OFFICE OF THAT THEY GET ACCESS. THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FEATURES. AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE THE AT THE CAUGHT THINGS WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE NEXT COLUMN OR SOME OF THINGS THAT CAL O. YES IS GONNA BE WORKING IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH A TNT AND FIRST NET. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS FIRST NIGHT NETWORK ALSO PROVIDES ALL THESE FEATURES AS WELL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO. SASSER FIRST NOW. SO WITH THAT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW I'M WILL TURN OVER TO THE BACK OF IMAGE. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE SEACOAST FEAR COME WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT. AND OBVIOUSLY CALAVERAS IS DEEPLY INTEGRATED. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. A WITH FIRST MET AND WITH EIGHTEEN T. AS THEY ROLL OUT. MOST. OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH A DRACULA SHE'S LETTER THAT ACCOMPANIED THE GOVERNOR'S. HOPPED IN DECISION DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH. AND SO ON WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE IN THAT ROLE AND IN LEADERSHIP CAPACITY TO ENSURE. THAT WERE A WORKING HAND IN HAND AT THE BESA SERVICES SEPARATE STATE CALIFORNIA. BUT FORTY OR QUESTIONS OF FOLLOWING THAT BUT. TO SOME AUGUST WILL TURN OVER TO ACHIEVE MARTINEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE I'M PRIVILEGED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. AS I SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO THE PREVIOUS. PANEL MEMBERS I WONDER WHY I AM SPEAKING IN. I'VE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES FOR ABOUT FORTY PLUS YEARS NOW THIRTY FIVE OF WHICH WERE IN THE FIRE SERVICE AND TWELVE OF THOSE YEARS OF THE FIRE CHIEF. HEARINGS ARE GOING TO COUNTY. I ALSO SPENT EIGHT YEARS IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVING AS THE. CHIEF OF LARGE SERVICES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND ALSO FOR YELLOW COUNTY. I'M WELL THAT EXPERIENCE GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT INTO PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS MY REMARKS TODAY ARE GONNA COME FROM SOME OTHER EXPERIENCES. A FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. I'VE PARTICIPATED. WITH THE FEDERAL MERGING MANAGEMENT'S AGENCY URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE PROGRAM. SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM IT WAS ACTUALLY STARTED IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWING ON THE CREATOR. AND THE MEXICO CITY EARTHQUAKE AS ITS DESIGN IS REALLY TO DEAL WITH. VICTIMS OF A COLLAPSE RUPTURED DURING EARTHQUAKES. AND I KNOW WHEN I FIRST GOT INVOLVED THAT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO OUR FOCUS WAS SIMPLY BEING PREPARED FOR EARTHQUAKES. ON MY FIRST DAY OF BLUSH WITH. NATIONAL DISASTERS WAS A FEW YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WITH THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING. MEMBERS THE SEPARATE AREA ALONG WITH OTHER TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE A URBAN SEARCH RESCUE TEAMS I SAY CALIFORNIA. AND MANY THIS TEAM'S RESPONDED TO BE. BOMBING IN AN OKLAHOMA IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN FOR ME AND FOR MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF OF THIS EVOLUTION THAT WE DEAL WITH THE DAY AND THAT IS LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS. FINDING THEMSELVES IN NOT ONLY OTHER COMMUNITIES BETTER OTHER STATES IN SOME CASES OTHER COUNTRIES. I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IN OKLAHOMA. WELL AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE A LARGE EVENT IT WAS. DEVASTATING. BUT THE FOOTPRINT WAS MUCH SMALLER. M. MY FIRST. REAL. I ATTENTION DE INTER OPERABILITY LACK OF IN OUR REALLY ARE FAILURE COMMUNICATION WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND THAT WAS AT HURRICANE FRAN HURTING FRIEND CAME TO THE CAROLINAS. PRETTY GOOD SWATH I WAS PART OF A AND A TEAM THAT WENT TO DO SEARCH AND RESCUE. ON THE CAROLINA COAST SOUTH CAROLINA SPECIFICALLY. THE FIRST TIME THAT I EXPERIENCED MEANS SET DOWN THE COMMUNITY AND SUDDENLY GOING FROM A RESPONDER TO SOMEONE. NEEDING SOME RESCUE AT OURSELVES WE WERE TOTALLY WITHOUT COMMUNICATION AT THAT TIME. OR OUTSIDE OF OUR LITTLE SPHERE COMMUNICATION CONSISTED OF CELLULAR. AND I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT A COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST OR TECHNICIAN OR AN EXPERT I AM IN USERS AND WHEN. YOU RELY ON A SINGLE VEHICLE TO COMMUNICATE AND IT FAILS. IT'S STARTLING AT FIRST. I WISH I COULD SAY THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME I FACE THAT. BUT A IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HER CANE KATRINA. I FOUND MYSELF IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI. AND WHILE WE HAD. MIGRATED FROM CELLULAR SOLELY TO CELLULAR AND SATELLITE PHONES. AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I WAS RESPONSIBLE WITH EIGHT HUNDRED. SEARCH AND RESCUE PERSONNEL IN GULFPORT MISSISSIPPI WE WERE. WORKING ABOUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY MILES OF COASTAL FRONT AND A WE WERE WITHOUT COMMUNICATION THAT PART OF THAT TIME. THE SAME THING HAPPENING GREENBERG KANSAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND I COULD GO ON. THE POINT IS IS. EARLIER YOU HEARD FROM THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS IT TALKED ABOUT AND INTER OPERABILITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY I COME FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST AND COMMUNICATION NETWORK THAT ALL. FIRST RESPONDERS AND OUR SUPPORT. MATRIX. HAS A VERY ROBUST. IN A COMPETE MEDICATION ABILITIES. RADIOS. BUT I'M SPEAKING TO MORE IS THE ABILITY TO TO HAVE THAT TO HAVE COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE OF THAT RADIO NETWORK. WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT KATRINA ARE GREENBERG OR HER CAN'T FRAN OR THE DOZEN OTHER HER KIDS IN TWENTY YEARS I'VE GONE TO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE UNABLE TO. PROVIDE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND EARLIER PANEL MEMBER THAT A MISSION THAT. THE INABILITY TO CONTACT OUTSIDE THE IMPACTED AREA TO SAY WE NEED THIS OPEN THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HERE. THE INABILITY TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INABILITY TO RECEIVE RESUPPLY. WITH THE SEVENTY EIGHT HER. FIRST WATER PERSONAL AHEAD IN HER CANE KATRINA ONE OF OUR BIGGEST COMPLICATIONS WAS FEEL. I MEAN WE LITERALLY MADE PARDEE DECISIONS ON BECAUSE WE DIDN'T APPEAL TO GET OUT THERE AND GET BACK. WHEN WE SENT TEAMS OUT TO THE FIELD WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAITED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BECAUSE WE ALWAYS WOULD SET UP A LOCAL RADIO NETWORK. WE STILL HAD NO OTHER COMMUNICATION VEHICLES AND THEN EVEN CALLING A BACK TO DC TO FEMA PROPER AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE NEED LONG TERM OVER THE WEEKS AHEAD. I'M. AS YOU LOOK FORWARD IN THIS VERDANT FIRST THAT COMES ON LINE I'M SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SOLUTIONS TO MANY OF THESE. BUT I WOULD AS A AS A LOCAL FIRE CHIEF IS SPENT. TWELVE YEARS MANAGING A LOCAL FIRE BUDGET. I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO ME. TO CONSIDER AND ALL ALL PARTIES ARE GOING FOR THAT. FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE INVOLVED AS FIRST RESPONDERS ARE SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE ROBUST AND REDUNDANT. IT NEEDS TO BE AFFORDABLE. WE NEED AN EASY MAINTAIN. IT NEEDS TO BE PROVEN TECHNOLOGY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN RELY ON AND IT'S EASY TO USE KNOW WHAT I'VE SEEN. OVER THE LAST FORTY. THREE YEARS. IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS INFLUENCE WHAT WE DO. FAR FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS IN EMS PERSONNEL AND MERGING MANAGE IT WE WE HAVE INTEGRATED APPROPRIATE LIKE WE HAVE IN OUR OWN HOMES. TECHNOLOGY AND EVERYTHING WE DO HOWEVER WHEN TECHNOLOGY FAILS. OR THE SUPPORTING ASPECTS OF THAT POWER. WHICH HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. WE BECOME RELIANT ON IT AND THEN WE HAVE AVOID. I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT I THINK SHARE TEAM POINT OUT. VERY WELL HOW MANY OF OUR COUNTIES ARE USING. THINGS LIKE EVER BRIDGE FOR PUBLIC NOTIFICATION A LAYERED EFFECT. AND I THINK FOR ME MANY NOT ALL OF OUR OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE A A PRETTY STRONG LOCAL NETWORK FOR RADIO COMMUNICATION. I'M NOT EXPECTING THAT VIDEO. STREAMING. ONLINE CHATTING. TEXT MESSAGING OR ANYTHING ELSE. I WOULD REALLY HAVE HOUSTON JUST ABOUT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE I HAVE BEEN IN SOME VOICE COMMUNICATION THE ABILITY TO TALK TO SOMEBODY. WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT HAD TO COMMUNICATE FOR BOTH AND NEEDS AND THEN FOR RECOVERY. PRESIDENT BRIEFLY STATED. CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY ROBUST MUTUAL AID PROGRAM. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE MANAGED TO COBBLE TOGETHER A RADIO NETWORK THAT WORKS IN FIRES. MANY OF OUR. FIRE COMPANIES ON LARGE WHILE AND FIRES DO IT A GOOD JOB OF COMMUNICATING A USING WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE. BUT AS YOU GO FORWARD WITH FIRST AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE EXTENDED SO THAT IN THESE DARK SPOTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISASTROUS AND YOU THE ADDRESS. THAT FIRST RESPONDERS REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISCIPLINE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND BE SUPPORTED. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS ON. THE THE FOLKS IT RESPONDED TO BOTH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE TO SAY THAT MY SON IS A. IS A FIREFIGHTER AS IS MY STEPDAUGHTER. AND SO I WILL TAKE THOSE BACK HOME AND THEY WILL BE APPRECIATIVE. WITH THAT I AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE IS A. BIT LONG IN THE TOOTH BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. OPEN UP THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF. MISS RODRIGUEZ. YES HAVE A QUESTION FOR BOTH FOR BOTH FROM BOTH PANELS. FIRST OF ALL. ON THE SHE YOU'RE SURE KNOWS THE SECOND REGARDING IMMIGRATION NEXT GEN NINE ONE FIRST NOT. SO HAVE YOU HAVE THE DIAGRAM OR. FROM THE AGAINST THE TOWER OF THE COMMUNICATION GOING TO POLICE FIRE. BACK AND FORTH. SELECT. AT THE ALMONDS IS THERE GOING TO BE AWAY WERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMS IS GOING TO BE ABLE. COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH FIRE OR PDA AS THEY CURRENTLY SHOWING AND YOU HAVE YOUR GRAPHIC HERE. IS THE REASON WHY THAT'S NOT. AN AREA THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE IT'S OF VERY IMPORTANT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRANSPORTING THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SICK AND INJURED THAT. BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR CANOES ELABORATE ON THEM. YEAH SO THAT THE GOAL OF THE GRAPHIC WAS TO BE. NOT OVERWHELM WITH DATA BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO SHOW EVERY APPLICATION THAT POTENTIALLY COULD RUN OVER FIRST NAT. OR OVER A BROADBAND SERVICE AT THE WHOLE PAGE WILL BE FULL SO ABSOLUTELY ALL OF THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT MISSION CRITICAL DATA FLOW AN INSTANT RESPONSE. THAT'S WHAT WE INTENDED TO TO REPRESENT WITH THAT LITTLE GRAPHIC THERE. SO APOLOGIZE IT'S A LITTLE SPARSE. NO NOT JUST THAT IT JUST GOES FROM FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WORKING IT IN. THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WAS INDUSTRIES HOW. YOU NO WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF JUST THE WEBER. BIG BUS CRSH OR SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES THAT COMMUNICATION IS NOT REALLY RELATE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR WERE SOME AGENCIES ARE CONTRACTED OUT WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU MUST PROVIDE. OF THE TRANSPORT EARNED AND THEN I'M IN THERE. ELLIS SERVICEABLE SPEAK AND AND WHAT THAT THE WHICH ONE TO SEE THAT WOMEN IN WHAT TO. GETS RICK MARTINEZ TALKING ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND KATRINA AND READ I WAS THERE AS WELL I SPENT FOUR WEEKS THERE. AND COMMUNICATION IS VITAL. YOU KNOW WE HAD A MILITARY RADIO THAT WAS GIVEN TO US. AND THEY WERE SO YOU GO TO THIS SECTION YOU CAN IS THERE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS. BUT IN NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE IN THE MONEY WE DID OUR DO OUT JOB. BUT I LOOK BACK AT MY EXPENSES THERE THAT. THAT'S STATE THOUGHT THEY WERE READY TO HANDLE DISASTER. WHEN THIS HER KINGS CAME THERE WERE TOTALLY TAKEN OFF. OFFICE YOU SAYING THAT THE THE INSTANCES OCCURRED THURMOND. INFRASTRUCTURE IS GONE. YOU KNOW WHAT AND WHEN IT CAME TO VITAL SERVICES IN MASS WIT IMPROVISING DO THINGS WE NORMALLY ARE USED TO DOING. SO HOPEFULLY AS LESSONS LEARNED FROM THEIR TONE OUT OF FIRES WE HAD LAST YEAR IN THE STATE AND WHAT'S NEXT GENERATIONS OF NINE ONE ONE. FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE REALLY SYSTEM THAT EVERYBODY CAN RELY ON AND AND. HOPE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DEAD ZONES AS WE REFERRED IT YOU KNOW I'M TALKING ABOUT I THINK EVERYBODY COMMUNITY KNOWS THAT THERE CERTAIN PARTS IN OUR CITIES OR COUNTIES OR THERE'S DEAD ZONES WHERE YOU CAN'T COMMUNICATE BECAUSE OF. THE LOCATION ARTS OUT AND HOPEFULLY WITH THESE NEW SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN GET RID OF THAT'S WE KNOW NO MATTER WHERE AT IN A ROW ERROR DOWN URBAN CITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. GOOD WAYS TO COMMUNICATE TO JUST WANDER BRING THAT FORD IS WELL. THANK YOU A DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. YES WHEN I QUESTIONS HAS TO DO. WITH NO TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE IN COURSE IN A DISASTER YOU MADE LOSE INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. WE SIT THERE WILL PREPARE YOU HAVE. CELL TOWERS YOU OF RADIO TOWERS IT'S UNDER. THE BE GOOD NOW THEY LOSE POWER ETCETERA. WHAT IT AND? MAYBE IT'S FOR THE FOLKS WHO FOLLOWED THE NEXT AIRBAGS. TO TERMS OF. WHAT'S OUR CAPACITY TO REBUILD A COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE FROM GROUND UP. THANK YOU NO CAN'T IT SIR I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT. THE. IS THERE TECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES SO THAT. YOU YOU SAID THAT A WAXED PAPER DRONE OUT THERE NOW THAT'S THE CELL TOWER BECAUSE THE CELL TOWERS ON THE GROUND OF ALL DAY AND YOU KNOW THE THE POWERS OR SOMETHING. SO. AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT. DARK SPOTS WELL THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. MAYBE SO I JUST DID WHAT BUT THE INVESTMENT TO FINALLY FELL IN THE DARK ABOUT THE NOW DIVERGENCES THERE CAN YOU SUDDENLY SET UP A QUICK COMMUNICATIONS LINK TO THAT DARK SPOT I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BUILD SOMETHING RIGHT. AND THE SEND SOME WINE OUT THERE SO IS IT. IS THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON AND TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO REALLY LIKE I COME UP WITH COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS THAT CAN BE SET UP AND YOU KNOW. THE FEW HOURS OR SOMETHING AND AND AND AND A PLACE AND THEN HOOK IT INTO THE. THE MAIN EIGHT THAT I WOULD THINK THAT THAT'S A KIND OF CAPABILITY WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO. SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF EVENT HAD THAT CAUSES THE OTHER DAMAGE AND SO THE FIRES WERE OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GO BACK AND REBUILD. OUR YOU WOULD NEED THAT THAT COVERAGE IN BECAUSE. YOU HEARD IT MENTIONED BEFORE THE TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY THE STATE. THAT THOSE THEIR SOULS KEY MOUNTAIN TOPS ARE OBVIOUSLY THE BEST POINTS. AT THE PLACE I INFRASTRUCTURE OF FORESTS AND IF YOU CAN'T ACCESS THEM. OF COURSE IT DOESN'T WORK AS WELL HAVING SAID THAT. COME. ARE PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IT MORE IN THEIR IN THEIR PERIOD. HARM TO ENGAGE IN A SERIES OF DEPLOYABLE AS THEY TRY TO BRING IN PART TO PROVIDE. SOME ACCESS FOR US INTO TO REPLICATE WHEN. INFRASTRUCTURE IS DAMAGED. AND THAT CAN WORK ARE REALLY WELL IF THERE'S WHAT THEY CALL BACK CALL BEHIND IT ALONE FISCALLY CAN. A DROP RIGHT IN AND AND ACTUALLY MIMIC IT RIGHT BEHIND IT. IF THERE'S NOT BACK CALL THEN THERE'S SOME LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF. WHO WILL SUPPORT WORKS REALLY WELL FOR MAYBE A SMALL COMMITTEE FIRST RESPONDERS? NOT SO GOOD IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE OF THE ENTIRE GENERAL POPULATION SO. THEY CAN. TALK TO MORE THAT BUT THE ANSWER QUESTIONS EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO. FIND SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BETTER THE KEEP THERE'S CONSTANTLY APPROACHING. US WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF THE CHINA AND PLACE AN AND. NUMBER OF SEE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. THANK YOU MS SAGER CURRY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON SO AS MANY OF THOSE YOU SITTING THERE NO MY BIG THING ABOUT FIRST THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT FIRES AND WINTERS CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T HAVE CELLPHONES WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY WALKIE TALKIES THE LAND LINES WERE DOWN AND WE COULD PREVENT A LOT OF FIRE. AND THAT'S WHEN I WENT AFTER FIRST THAT MONEY. AND I'M FRUSTRATED SITTING HERE TODAY THAT WE ARE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND NOTHING HAS REALLY HAPPENED. NOW I'M NOT GONNA POINT FINGERS AT ANYONE BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY BEHIND THIS BUT MY FRUSTRATION IS THAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEPLOY THIS WITH THE TIMELINE. I THINK NOW WE ARE IN THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE ALL BACK PEDDLING ON. AND MY LOOK AT THIS AND I SAY WELL THAT SEEM MARCH SEVENTEENTH. TWO THOSE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO GOT THE CONTRACT WITH THAT'S GREAT I'M THAT GUY THAT'S MOVING ALONG. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL DECEMBER TWENTIETH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DECIDED POPPED INTO FIRST KNOW WHAT TOOK SO LONG. IF YOU HAVE THAT I'M MAD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT TOOK SO LONG FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO. YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE AND MAYBE SOME OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED. I'M DOES TALK ABOUT ONE TIME THAT IT WOULD BE BUTTE DEPLOYED SINCE WAS THROUGH THAT A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE DEPLOYED ON FEDERAL BUILDINGS WELL THAT MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME BECAUSE YOU PUT ON TOP OF A DAM YOU COULD PUT HIM ON TOP OF. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT FEDERAL BUILDINGS TO AT LEAST GET IT GOING. AND SO. MY FRUSTRATION ISN'T WITH YOU IS JUST WITH WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE LEHIGH. AND I'M NOT I'M. JUST LIKE. HERE WE ARE. AND MAYBE WE COULD OF ADDRESS SOME OF THIS LONG ALONG THE WAY. IT SEEMS LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE TO GO BACK AND START THIS ALL OVER AGAIN. SO. IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST HELPING ME OUT AND DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE THAT IS ACTUALLY DEPLOYED TO SHUT. I CAN BUT LET BUDGET TALK ABOUT BUT. BE AND FOURTEEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEPLOYMENT. OF IT SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT. AT SPECTRUM THAT'S BEING USED. IT IN EIGHTEEN T. CAN ANSWER THAT FOR AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY. NOW THAT. THE STATE'S OPTED EN AND OTHER STATES HAVE THEIR STARTING THEN INSTALLATION SO THEY CAN TELL YOU WHAT THEIR TIMELINE IS IN. HOW THAT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT FOR YOU? I WILL SAY THAT. ARE FOR CALIFORNIA WE CERTAINLY HAD HARDLINE SUSPENSE IS THAT WE HAD TO COMPLY WITH WITHIN. I NATIONALLY AND MOST OF US WERE IN AND VERY. DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE WANTED FOR CALIFORNIA. SO. IF YOU. YOU HAVE THE SELECTION OF EIGHTEEN TO FURTHER PLANTING OF FORGETTING THE CONTRACT. AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT. FEW MONTHS LATER IS WHEN THEY CAME OUT STATES WITH THE PLAN. AND THEY ROLLED OUT THAT PLAN TO US. AND AT THAT POINT TIME WE. HAD BEEN MEETING WITH OUR OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GETTING. IN ACCEPTING THE BEST PLAN POSSIBLE FOR YOU. AYE EARLY OFTEN. WOULD ADMIT THAT WE'RE ACCEPTING THE VERY FIRST BROWN. NEGOTIATION AND SO HOW WE SAT DOWN AND WENT THROUGH A SERIES OF PRIORITIES THAT WERE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. AND MADE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TRY TO ADDRESS EACH OF THOSE PRIORITIES WITH US AND SO THAT ITERATE THAT. HOW THOSE ITERATIONS WERE A SWING BACK AND FORTH WITH EIGHTEEN T. WITH WHAT WE WANTED COUNTER PROPOSALS ALONG WITH WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO? OBLIGED TO BECAUSE ONCE THEY SUBMITTED THAT FINAL PLAN TO CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE ENFORCEABLE PLAN. THAT FIRST NET WILL HOLD EIGHTEEN TO ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOR THE BILL OUT FOR ALL OF US. AND SO. AN EARLY AND EARLY YES. I DON'T A CHRIS HAS MY FULL STATES BUT ORDER SIMPLY SAY IF YOU ACCEPTED THE FIRST PLAN WITHOUT GETTING IN NEGOTIATION ON THINGS ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE BEST. POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR YOUR STATE. SENATE JACKSON AND I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY A NICE SEGUE I I'VE READ THE LETTER BY. DIRECTOR KILLER DO CHIEF WHO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IS DONE EXTRAORDINARY JOB FOR. ALL OF A SUDDEN. UP I NOTE HERE. THAT. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST PAGES SUTTER SO EXACTLY THRILLED. WITH THE WAY THIS. SORT OF EVOLVED SAYING THAT. WE BASICALLY. DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF CHOICE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POLITICS WERE I JUST KNOW THAT. HE'S NOT VERY HAPPY AND I'M GOING TO BE ASKING OUR FIRST THAT PEOPLE. TO RESPOND TO SOME OF. THE CONCERNS THAT HE EXPRESSED. PARTICULARLY. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ADDRESSING THE THREE CONCERNS ONE BEING INTER OPERABILITY. OF THE SECOND BEING SECURITY THIS. ACTUALLY. DOESN'T. APPARENTLY DOESN'T HAVE. TO GIVE ACCESS TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE TO USE THESE. THE CLUTCH SYSTEM IN THE OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEMS WHICH I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IS WELL AWARE OF AND. VERY IMPORTANT IN THE WORK THAT THAT HE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE DO AND HAVE DONE. AND THEN THE THIRD ITEM. IS HARDENING. IS THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW THE CELLULAR SITES AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM. UP IN THE HILLS WHICH HAVE BEEN THE FIRST THING THE GOAL WHEN I THINK ALSO WERE IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. WE KNOW CELL TOWERS GO WEEK WE LOSE WE LOSE COMMUNICATION. AND SO WE NEED THAT RESILIENCY IN THE REDUNDANCY AND AS I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT THIS. PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE. AND YET THERE IS CONCERN THAT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT HAS BEEN OFFERED SO I'M. I WOULD I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. MISTER I'M A DAVID CHIU I HOPE I'VE GOT THAT RIGHT AYE IS SO HAVE YOU BEEN CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT AND I WILL. SHARE THAT MY I'M GOING TO ASK THOSE VERY SAME QUESTIONS TO OUR. FIRST MET PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE. I THINK THEY'RE LEGITIMATE AND I THINK THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE LEARNED AGAIN SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED ESOS TOWERS OF GONE OUT. WITH THE FIRES AND. HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT REDUNDANCY AND RESILIENCY THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA? AFFECTIVELY PAYING FOR AND EXPECT. SO COULD YOU KIND OF UPDATE US ON THAT. GOING FORWARD NOT GOING BACK WHICH WERE GOING FORWARD. YES. SINCE. THE. OFTEN A DECISION WAS MADE WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH A WITH A TNT AND I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. OF THE EXAMPLES THAT. YOU. YOU'VE MENTIONED WITH SIX HOURS IN THE NOW SIX DAYS IN WHICH ARE TALKING ABOUT. HOW? HOW LONG CAN YOU OPERATE NOW WITHOUT POWER AND AND AND ACCESS IN AND TO THOSE AREAS AND SO? OBVIOUSLY WE WANT THE MOST RESILIENT SYSTEM POSSIBLE THAT'S WHAT OUR EFFORTS ARE. TO WORK WITH ANYA EIGHTEEN T. INFERS THAT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US AND. HAVE. INDICATED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE SITE HARDENING OTHERS A SOLUTION WITH THAT MOTION FOR THE FOR THE KLUTZ ACCESS. OUR BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT WE WANTED IT DONE IT SHOULD BE A AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE. AND SO THEY'VE COME FOR WITH A GOOD SOLUTION FORCE VERSION THINK THAT THE. THE SHOP TO PAY FOR IT SHOULD BE PART OF YOUR SERVICE PACKAGE AND SO. OF SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WERE. WORKING THAT ADD TOGETHER JOINTLY. ON OUR NEGOTIATION SO FOR THAT TRYING TO FIND WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND THEN THE INTER OPERABILITY PIECE. IS STILL SOMETHING THAT WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS A LOT AREAS THAT. ARE GOING TO BE USING VERIZON SERVICE. FOR AWHILE NOW WHILE EIGHTEEN HE BUILDS OUT HEATHER INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO ON IN THOSE AREAS WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF IN OUR ABILITY PIECE AND. THEY'VE COMMITTED TO LEASE A MAINTENANCE DISCUSSIONS AND WHERE POSSIBLE WORK WITH US. FROM IT SO BUDGET EARNING I'VE MISSED ON THAT. YEAH SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED ON DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS AND SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU SEE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT LETTER WERE NEGOTIATION PIECES WE WERE TRYING TO GET. AND WARRANT AS X. SUCCESSFUL AS I WANTED TO BE. KNOWING THE NEEDS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND REALLY THAT'S THE TAKEAWAY. WE LISTENED TO THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO BE USING THE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE COMMUNICATED THAT BACK THAT WAS THE FOCUS OF OUR EFFORT. AND SO AS WE COMMUNICATED THAT BACK YOU CAN YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS A GIVE AND TAKE AND WHERE WE ENDED UP IS WITH THESE GAPS THAT WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS NOW IN THE DEPLOYMENT. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH A TNT AND FIRST MET TO ADDRESS THESE REMAINING GAPS AS THEY ROLL OUT THE SYSTEM. YOU I'M. GO GO AHEAD SORRY I JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO RAISE THEIR HAND AT THE FOR FOR CHRISTMAS. GO AHEAD PLEASE. ALL YOU MISTER MEDICAL*. MY PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT. MEDICAL WHICH OKAY GREAT THANK YOU I. I WAS JUST WONDER IF WE COULD. CIRCLE BACK A LITTLE BIT. ON MAYBE SOME LOW TECH ALTERNATIVES AND I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE THIS IS REALISTIC BUT. CB RADIOS AND HAM RADIO I WONDER IF THESE ARE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMMUNICATIONS IN THE NOW IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY WHERE EVERYTHING GOES DOWN. THE ANSWER IS YES WE AYE I MEAN ARE RESPONDED COMMUNITY USES EVERYTHING AND WE STILL HAVE FELLOW HAM OPERATORS. AS PART OF OUR. I WOULD SAY NO WHEN YOU GO FROM. YOUR PRIMARY COMMUNICATIONS USUALLY AS ON YOUR ON YOUR VOICE IN YOUR INTERNET THAT YOU'RE USING IT HAVE FORM. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO CELLULAR AS YOUR SECONDARY BACKUP NO WE HAVE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE USE IN OUR TERTIARY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. AND IN WE SLAM OVER RADIOS AND THEN WE GO INTO. AND WE START REALLY GETTING INTO. THE ALL WAY TO THAT POINT WEAVES LOW TECH A SERVICES BECAUSE. EVERY TOOL COUNTS AND SO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE. OF THAT ONE THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR YOU AND AND AND. BE ABLE TO. ENHANCE THE SITUATION TO WORK IN FRONT OF. GREAT THANK YOU. TO GET A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS AND I'M GONNA ASK US TO MOVE ON SO HERE'S WHO I HAVE AG YOU'RE CURRENTLY MON ENABLE MUSLIM OWN AND THEN MISTER COOPER UNLESS I MISS SOME. ON THIS RODRIGUEZ AND I'LL JUST ASK FOR BREVITY SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE TOKYO. BE SURE. OKAY. THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER I I'M SORRY. OBVIOUSLY MOON THE MISS COOPER. THANK YOU THAT SO THAT THE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FUTURE THREATS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA AND AM IN THE LAST. PANEL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS. HOW WE DID IN TERMS OF GETTING COMMUNICATION AND SPANISH ACCORDING TO THE LAST CENSUS FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS AS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN? ENGLISH AT HOME. HOW DO WE BRING THAT FORTY FOUR PERCENT ALONG IN THE COMMUNICATIONS DO YOU HAVE IDEAS IF SO WHAT ARE THOSE IDEAS? SO ON THAT THE PEACE COME IN ON NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE WE HAVE AT THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE SERVICE THAT WE OFFERED EVERY PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINT. AND THAT CONTRACT IS VERY SPECIFIC THE TOP FIVE. LANGUAGES ARE ACCOMMODATED WITHIN YOU KNOW SECONDS OF WHEN IT COMES AND AND THEN THE REST HAVE A LONGER DURATION. AND SO ON THE AND THE INGRESS PATH YOU THINK ABOUT THE PACKED COMING IN WE'VE ADDRESS THAT THROUGH THE NET THAT NEXT GEN I'M ONE SYSTEM IN THE EXISTING NINE ONE SYSTEM. THE NEXT STEP TO YOUR POINT IS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT ON PUSHING THE INFORMATION OUT THRILLER AND WARNINGS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING. IN AT CALLAWAY ASKED TO IDENTIFY THOSE NEEDS. IN EVEN ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THE FCC. THROUGH TEXT TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEWARK AND ARE FULLY DEPLOYED BUT THOSE ARE SOME THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT TO GET THAT DATA GOING BACK OUT IN IN A IN A WAY THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. YOU RUN INTO SOME CHARACTER SET ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE LANGUAGES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE. AND I AM GLAD THAT THAT THAT THAT WORK IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT FORTY FOUR PERCENT AS WELL AS BEING NUMBER AND THIS IS AT A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN AWAY REALIZE WHEN A STREET GOT TRANSLATE ELSE LIKE NO THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO TRANSLATE THE STREET NOT THE STREET NAME BECAUSE THERE IS NO STREET NAME. WITH THAT TRANSLATION IT'S IN ENGLISH AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE LOOK FOR AND SO THERE'S ELEMENTS LIKE THAT THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO EVERYBODY. I'M IN THAT COMMUNITY SO I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING AND I HOPE WE DON'T DROP THOSE BECAUSE THOSE ARE DEFINITELY PART. THE OF OF OF REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE KEEP THE COMMUNICATION GOING. TO THANK YOU MR GRUBER. IS PHONE UPON SENATOR JACKSON'S COME ABOUT HARDING WILL SITES OF. YOU KNOW SAFE YOUR HOME THAT'S READY FIREPROOF FOR FOUR HOURS WHEN THE HARD THE SIDES OF THE CAN DO THAT FOR FOUR EIGHT HOURS. AND THEN TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS VERY FOR PORTABLE RADIO FOR AN OFFICER TO HAVE ON THEIR HIP. BEFORE THE DOLLARS APIECE FOR RADIO FOR REGULAR VEHICLES ABOUT FIFTY FIVE. FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS SO THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE MAY CHANGE THE FORTY FOUR INDUCTS FOR PORTABLE RADIO. SO I GUESS THE ISSUE IS AT SOME POINT THINGS DO GO DOWN. I WAS TOLD THERE SOME SYSTEM WHERE BOUNCES OFF THE ATMOSPHERE. ANOTHER COMMUNICATION DEVICE BECAUSE. THE NET STUFF IS GREAT BUT. I WAS FOR A BACKUP SO. WHAT OTHER SYSTEMS ARE OUT THERE? IT A RELIABLE AND AFTER A LOT ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE ATMOSPHERIC FANEUIL MUCH ABOUT IT. PETERSON SOME OF THOSE OTHER OPTIONS. YEAH BETWEEN BUDGET I KNOW HE'S MY TECHNICAL EXPERTS I'M JUST. THE. THE TALKING ADDICT VIA. SO. YOU KNOW YOUR LAND MOBILE RADIO THE TRIBUTE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE THAT IS GOING TO STAY IN PLACE FOR YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR OFFICERS AND LOG FIRE. THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY ANYTIME AND SO HOW WE WORK HAND IN HAND WITH ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES THAT WE SUPPORT WITH OUR LAMB OPERATOR SYSTEM HERE TECH CALAVERAS THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS. A DIVISION SO. AND THOSE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE AND AS A BUDGET POINTED OUT AND WE HAD NO LOSSES FOR ANY OF OUR FIRED ITS FOR FOR LAND MOBILE RADIO SYSTEMS THERE. I'M SO THAT WAS THAT WAS HUGE OF FORT FIRST HAD NO HAD NO LOSSES IN. CIVILIAN WE HAD NO LOSSES IN OUR TOWERS OR STRUCTURE EVEN THOUGH WE LOST POWER WE HAD YOU MINUTES MISTER CASES WE HAVE SEVEN DAYS OF OF. A FEW ON HAND WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. AND CAL FIRE CHP FISHING GAME HOW MANY LOCAL AGENCIES THAT ARE ARE ARE HUNG ON OUR SAME. TOWERS FOR THE STARS APPEARED THAT THE REASON DISCUSSING IT YOU USE THAT'S THE THE SAME NETWORK THAT WE'RE USING MISSILE HIT LUGER TOWERS BUT WE LOST CELTA. CORRECT I GUESS I GUESS IN YOUR TOWER SUMMER ON PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN YOUR RURAL AREAS THERE ON MOUNTAINTOPS SO I GUESS KNOWS FOR THOSE AREAS WHY DID. YOUR TOWERS SURVIVED AND NOT THE. CELLPHONE TOWERS. THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE DIFFERENT GREAT STRUCTURE AND EIGHTEEN T. IN AND. CAN REDRESS THAT BEST FOR YOU HERE BUT THE BUT THE BOTTOM LINES WERE BUILT WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY GREAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE. ARM ART CHARTERS HIS TO SPORTS IN PUBLIC SAFETY GRAY. NETWORK SERVED THIRTY ZAINAL DIFFERENTLY AND SO THEY CAN THEY CAN ANSWER THAT FOR YOU BUT I WILL SAY THAT. AS WE GOING TO FIRST NET BECAUSE FIRST IT'S NOT ANY OTHER TOOL FOR THE OFFICERS ARE OUT THERE. WILL HAVE THAT CELLPHONE IN HER HAND BEING ABLE TO USE THAT LTE NETWORK THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE ALL THESE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OTHER GONNA BE FOR THEM AND SO. IT IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WHICH IS WHY THAT RESILIENCY FOR THAT NETWORK IS IMPORTANT US TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE CARRIERS. MAKE IT IS RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE REDUNDANCY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT. THEY HAVE AN EXTRA TWO ON THEIR HANDS WE GOTTA MAKE SURE TOWERS SURVIVED YOU RECOMMENDING UPGRADING THOSE TOWERS. IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE PRONE TO FIRES. I'M WE RECOMMENDED THAT. A SERIES OF OF OF PIECES TO IT IT'S A YOU KNOW DEBRIS CLEARANCE FROM THE AREAS. HARDENING GENERATORS. HOWARD THE SET UP IN A LOT OF THE. OTHER THINGS THAT WE BUILD INTO OUR STRUCTURE OFFICE TODAY A LOT MORE TOWERS AND WE DO. BUT NONE THE LESS BECAUSE THERE'S MICROCELLULAR LARGE CELLS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT TYPES BUT. OBVIOUSLY THE MORE RESILIENT THEY ARE THE MORE REDUNDANCY PASSER OUT THERE TO PICK UP THE LOAD FOR THEM. A MEANS THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY WILL HAVE A RELIABLE NETWORK TO USE A WHEN THEY'RE USING EPO. I'M ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE IS WE GAVE A LIST OF BLOCKED SITES THAT SUPPORT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF OF THESE ARE CELL SITES THAT ARE OVER A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. OR OVER SOME OTHER-MISSION CRITICAL. POINT THROUGHOUT THE STATE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE OF THOSE THAT WE GAVE DE TNT THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS AND THEY COMMITTED TO HARDENING THOSE AND THAT'S THE FIRST STEP. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CELL SITES AND WE'VE ASKED FOR A SMALL PIECE TO BE HARDENED. REALLY FOR THE NETWORK TO BE SURVIVABLE TO YOU KNOW SUPPORT EVERYTHING WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY LEON TIRES THING WOULD NEED TO BE HARDENED TO ANOTHER LEVEL AND THAT WAS IN OUR INITIAL ASK. THAT WE NICK TRIED TO NEGOTIATE AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS NETWORK AND SURVIVE IN. AND THROUGH THOSE TWO PIECES IT'S THE POWER INTO THE SITE. AND IT'S THE DATA BACK ALL THAT CONNECTS THE SITE BACK TO THE YOU KNOW TO THE PIECES THAT ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS ON WHERE TO SEND THE CALL. BOTH OF THOSE ARE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON THANK YOU. THINKING OUT WITH A ONE THINK THE PANELISTS VERY MUCH FOR A PARTICIPATING GAUGING. IN THIS CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. NOT GONNA MOVE THE NEXT UP. AND LAST PANEL. FIRST THEN IT CALIFORNIA'S. INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND THAT WE HAVE THREE PRESENTATIONS IN THIS ORDER MISS KENNEDY ON MCNEALY. AND THIS. ARIANNA CURTIS. AM GONNA DO THE SAME THING WE'VE DONE THE PAST. TEN MINUTES PIECE OF IF. THEY NEED THAT AMOUNT THE MEMO GOING TO Q. AND A. AND THANK YOU THE PANELIST THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO A CHAIRWOMAN JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR TO BE HERE TODAY. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY. AND WITH OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNER EIGHTEEN T.. AND WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW WE INTEND TO DELIVER THE NATIONWIDE PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND NETWORK OR THE NPS BEGAN HEARING CALIFORNIA. I'M JANETTE KENNEDY I AM THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR LEAD FOR ABOUT THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY. FOR CALIFORNIA. LET ME ALSO THE FIRST THING CAL O. YES DIRECTOR KILLER DUTY DEPUTY DIRECTOR CRADDICK OF ITCH. OF THE TEAM THERE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK BOARD. I OVERTHE LAST FOUR YEARS WE ENGAGED IN HEAVY CONSULTATION A TWO TIERED HERMAN THE NEEDS OF FIRST RESPONDERS. EMERGING YOU HAD EMERGENCY MANAGERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. YEAH AS THE CULMINATION OF THIS EFFORT GOVERNOR BROWN OPTED IN TO FIRST NET. AND THAT BASICALLY GAVE THE GO AHEAD FOR THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY AND EIGHTEEN T.. TO BEGIN DEPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA. I AND IS IS WITH THIS RIGOROUS EFFORT THEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO. COMMIT TO DIALOGUE AND INCREASED ACTIVITY NOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AYE OPERATIONALLY STATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NETWORK. SO THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY WAS CREATED BY CONGRESS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AS A RESULT OF ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE NINE ELEVEN COMMISSION REPORT. IN OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE THE BUILDING MAINTENANCE DEPLOYMENT AND OPERATION. OF THIS NATIONWIDE BROADBAND NETWORK. AND THAT IT WILL EQUIP FIRST RESPONDERS WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO HAVE. MISSION CRITICAL DATA COMMUNICATIONS. AS WE HEARD EARLIER FIRST THAT IS NOT. THE LAND MOBILE RADIO NETWORK THAT. CALIFORNIA STATE OR LOCAL ENTITIES OPERATE NOR IS IT THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE NETWORK. THE FIRST NET NETWORK IS THE ONLY NATIONWIDE NETWORK WITH TRUE PRIORITY. AND RUTHLESS PREEMPTION DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SO AS YOU HEARD WE ENGAGED IN AN EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION PERIOD. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND. YOU KNOW AND WE ALSO ENGAGED IN AN OPEN TRANSPARENT COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS TO FIND IT NATIONWIDE VENDOR. AND THAT VENDOR WAS EIGHTEEN T. SELECTED IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND THIS CONTRACT WILL BE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TAKES ADVANTAGE OF OUR RESPECTIVE CORE STRENGTH. AND ASSETS. FIRST THAT BRINGS TWENTY MEGAHERTZ OF SPECTRUM IN THE SEVEN HUNDRED MEGAHERTZ BAND. OUR GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES. SUCCESS BASED PAYMENTS UP TO SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS OUR EXPERTISE IN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS. EIGHTEEN T. IS BRINGING ITS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING USE OF ITS LTE BANDS. FOR PRIORITIZE USED BY PUBLIC SAFETY. BRINGS ITS OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN MANAGING A WIRELESS. SYSTEM. AND FINANCIAL STABILITY TO PERFORM OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. TO PUT HAVE REALLY SIMPLY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THIS IS A FEDERAL CONTRACT THAT HAS. REGULAR ASSESSMENTS AND DISINCENTIVE. OPPORTUNITIES IN CASE THERE ARE FAILURES OUT INTO POINT THE NETWORK. AND WITH THE UC CONSULTATION THAT WE ENGAGE WITH THE STATE. AS WELL AS. OF THE LETTER THAT CAME WITH THE STATE PLAN HERE THERE ARE CONTRACTUAL OF IT AREAS FOR US TO BE SURE THAT THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA REMAIN RELEVANT. AND ARE PART OF THE NETWORK OPERATION DEPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE. SO. NOW THAT WE ARE. GOING INTO THIS NETWORK WE PREPARED FOR THIS NETWORK BY ENGAGING. EARLY ON WITH FIVE EARLY BUILDER PROJECTS TO LOOK AT HOW THIS SPECTRUM COULD BE UTILIZED. IN THE S. IN THE FUTURE IT'S C-SPAN. SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF THE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM OR LA REX. OPERATED IN EARLY BUILDER LTE PROJECT USING OUR SPECTRUM AND TESTED SEVERAL KEY LEARNING. OPPORTUNITIES. I WITH THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM LA REX AND THE OTHER AT A EARLY BUILDING PROJECTS WE GRANT CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE THE ROLLOUT OF THE GUEST YES BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND SINCE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH EIGHTEEN HE WAS VILIFIED JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO. YOU KNOW WE GAUGE HEAVILY WITH EIGHTEEN TEACH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE PLAN. AND THIS STATE PLAN INCLUDES THE BUILD OUT FOR THE RADIO ACCESS NETWORK OR THE RAN INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS ALL OF THE FIFTY SIX STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT ARE. WE WILL. INTEND TO SERVE. SO DURING THIS PROCESS OF THE STATES WERE ABLE TO REVIEW PLANS. I MAKE COMMENTS AND WHERE FEASIBLE. WE INTEGRATED THOSE. RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS AND THEY ARE REFLECTED IN THE FINAL INPUT OF THE STATE PLAN. ONCE THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY PROVIDE OFFICIAL NOTICE TO THE PLAN. GOVERNORS HAD NINETY DAYS BY STATUTE. TO MAKE THE DECISION A WHETHER THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST NET PROGRAM. IN WHICH CASE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN EIGHTEEN T.. PROVIDES THE FUNDING AND PAYS FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE RAN. IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S OFTEN OR WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE WOULD OPT OUT IN WHICH CASE OF THE GOVERNOR. WOULD BASICALLY COMMIT THE STATE TO DEPLOYING THAT RAN. I AND OPERATE THE NETWORK. AND MAINTAIN THE NETWORK FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO ON DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN CHOSE TO OPT IN. SO FIRST THAT IN EIGHTEEN T. WILL PROCEED TO BUILD. THE. AND PSP AND IN CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA'S FIRST RESPONDERS. SO IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING UNFETTERED UNINTERRUPTED NETWORK ACCESS TO FIRST RESPONDERS. FIRST NET WILL HELP IMPROVE RESPONSE TIMES AND SITUATION AWARENESS. SO THIS INCLUDES APPLICATIONS OTHER LOCATION SERVICES YOU CAN SEND TEXT MESSAGES SEND VIDEO. YIELD TEN MAPPING INFORMATION. ALL THESE TYPES THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT NECESSARILY A. A WIDELY ADOPTED TODAY IN URGENCY COMMUNICATIONS AND RESPONSE. SO THE NETWORK TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO BE TESTED AND VALIDATED THROUGH WITH THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY INNOVATION AND TEST LAB LOCATED IN BOULDER COLORADO. THIS IS INTO THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE RELIABLE TOOLS AT THE PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE. OPERATE APPLICATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO PERFORM THEIR JOBS TODAY. I WAS SO YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. REGARDING DIRECTOR KILLER TUCCI'S LETTER I THINK THAT WE HAD ADDRESSED IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION AND OUTRAGEOUS LIES TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. SOME OF THOSE THREE AREAS SO INTER OPERABILITY. WE ALREADY HAVE VOICE INTERCONNECTION TODAY SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN A CELL PHONE CALL FROM ONE CARRIER TOGETHER ONE AND THAT WORKS FINE. IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE APPLICATIONS THAT ALREADY WORK ACROSS DIFFERENT CARRIERS. BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS FIRST THAT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT. SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS. HA. FOR FIRST THAT SUBSCRIBERS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED THAT HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY FEATURES LIKE MISSION CRITICAL PUSH TO TALK. AND YOU KNOW ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE SANDERS SPACE. SO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO YOU KNOW USE THE STANDARDS WILL BE ABLE TO USE. TO CREATE THOSE TYPES OF APPLICATIONS. BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF FEATURES THAT PERCENT IS REALLY DRIVING ACROSS. ON THE NETWORK AND HAVING OUR NETWORK IN THE RELIABILITY SUPPORT THOSE FEATURES FOR FIRST NET USERS. IN TERMS OF SITE HARDENING. WE DO HAVE AS PART OF OUR CONTRACT WITH THE TNT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT AND AROUND SECURITY THAT'S PHYSICAL SECURITY AS WELL AS CYBERSECURITY. BECAUSE I KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS. AS A NUMBER AS WE HEARD ABOUT FROM THE FIRST PANEL BUT ALSO. IN THE SECOND A NUMBER OF YOU KNOW VERY TREMENDOUS. PUBLIC SAFETY EVENTS. IN RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS AND SO THOSE OF ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WE HAD THE WITH THE STATE WERE ALSO INCLUDED AS AS PART OF THE STATE PLAN. IN A SIDE LETTER. AND I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THIS MORNING WE FIRST SET AND EIGHTEEN T. ANNOUNCED THAT. WE WILL BEGIN THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF NETWORK WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE DOCUMENTS IN THOSE ITEMS THAT WERE INCLUDED AS PART OF STATE PLAN HAVE BEEN CODIFIED IN NOW IS PART OF THE PLAN OF RECORD. TO START DEPLOYING IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THE SHOWS THAT THE PROCESS WHEREBY THE INPUT FROM THE STATE AND FIRST RESPONDERS. CAN BE PUT AS PART AND WILL BE ACTED UPON AND ACTIONABLE. THROUGH THIS CONTRACT. AND THE LAST QUESTION IS ON SECURITY. AND I THINK TO DAILY WE ALREADY HAVE SOLUTIONS IN PLACE. DAY AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND TO SEE JUST INFORMATION. THAT ENTITY. I USUALLY HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED THROUGH THEIR STATE. AND LET'S AGENCY. ON AND THAT'S A SYSTEM WHERE AND I YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THERE WOULD THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS BY FIRST HAVING FIRST THAT ITSELF. FLATTENED AREA WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THE ENTITY THAT IS REQUESTING INFORMATION. AND WHAT'S TO USE THAT INFORMATION MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE MANAGED BY THE LOCAL ENTITY AND THE LOCAL ENTITIES REQUIREMENTS TO MEET THE FBI REQUIREMENTS. SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED. COM THAN THAT THERE ARE OTHER SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE AND IN THE FUTURE THERE MAY BE NO OTHER SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN. THAT MOTION BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TODAY SO IT OVER THE LIFE OF OUR CONTRACT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND OTHER STATES EMAIL. AND OUR AND OTHER PARTNERS. TO LOOK AT SOLUTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THAT EASIER BUT. IT'S FAR IS GOING THROUGH UPON WHAT WE HAVE TODAY A YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STATE OF CONVERSATION AND. HOW WE INTEND TO MOVE FORWARD? SO IN CONCLUSION NOW THAT FIRST THAT HAS OPTED IN. A YOU KNOW WE COMMIT TO CONTINUE CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT IT MEETS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY. AND WHILE THERE MAY BE MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US WITH COVERAGE AND. I IMPROVED. DEPLOYMENT SPEEDS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A HIGH DEMAND A RELENTLESS. NEED FOR RELIABILITY AND COVERAGE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A DRIVER IN OUR PROGRAM. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY IN NEW LOOK FOR TEN THE QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SWIMMINGLY YEAH CON GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MAN THAT'S AND IAGO SENATOR JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEN MCNEELY AND PRESIDENT OF EIGHTEEN TO CALIFORNIA AND I'M. HERE TO UPDATE THE COMMITTEE ON THE PROGRESS A TNT IS MAKING AND WORKING WITH ITS FIRST NET PARTNERS TO PROVIDE NATIONWIDE BROADBAND NETWORK FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS IS OURS HISTORIC TWENTY FIVE YEAR PRIVATE PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP LEADING TO AN UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. MAKING PUBLIC SAFETY A PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. THIS INVESTMENT IN THE BILL ABOUT SUPPORTING IT IS EXPECTED TO CREATE TEN THOUSAND U. S. JOBS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THESE NEW JOBS WILL INCLUDE POSITIONS IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. NETWORK DEPLOYMENT IN OPERATIONS. A TNT HAS A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR HISTORY OF INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO SERVING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY. WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO DELIVERING DEDICATED INTEROPERABLE NETWORK THAT WILL GIVE CALIFORNIA FIRST RESPONDERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS ACROSS THE NATION. THE TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO COMMUNICATE AND COLLABORATE ACROSS AGENCIES AND JURISDICTIONS DURING EMERGENCY RESPONSES. THIS OPPORTUNITY ALLIANCE WITH OUR HISTORY OF SERVING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC. SO SAFETY COMMUNITY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TAKE TO I THINK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF OF PARTICULARLY THE DIRECTOR OF. GET A. GIL. GILLER DUTY AND HIS STAFF. THEY WORK TIRELESSLY ON THIS EFFORT AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR PART IN THEM IN THE FIRST ADOPTED PROCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. A TNT IS HONORED TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO BUILD AND MANAGE AT THE FIRST NET NETWORK AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO BRINGING TO BEAR ALL THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. JUST AS CONGRESS ENVISIONED WHAT DOES THIS MEAN. FIRST AS PART OF ITS COMMITMENT A TNT WILL SPANNED FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF FIRST NET TO CONTRACT TO BUILD OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE NETWORK. A TNT WILL CONNECT FIRST NAT TO ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK VALUED AT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS. SECOND. A TNT WILL SUPPORT FIRST THAT WITH ITS WORLD CLASS DISASTER RECOVERY INDIE OUR TEAM IF YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TO SEE THAT IN ACTION HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THIS TEAM WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO HAS A SINGLE MISSION. TO RECOVER EIGHTEEN T. VOICE AND DATA SERVICES IN AREAS AFFECTED BY DISASTER. THE INDY OUR SOLUTIONS COMBINES NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT TRAILERS RECOVERING ENGINEERING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND THE RESPONSE TEAM WITH BOTH FULL TIME AND VOLUNTEER MEMBERS FROM EIGHTEEN ANTI. TEAM MEMBERS HAVE SPENT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOURS WORKING ON FILLED EXERCISES AND DEPLOYMENTS OF THE LAST TWO DECADES. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE DEDICATED NETWORK TEAM WILL WILL ALL BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES AND FIRST RESPONDERS AFFECTED BY EMERGENCIES. AND WE WILL INCREASE OUR EXTENSIVE CALIFORNIA FLEET OF MOBILE ASSETS WITH THE PLOY DOUBLES. EXCLUSIVELY DEDICATED TO TO SUPPORT FIRST AT. THE NETWORK WILL GET FIRST RESPONDERS PRIORITY AND BY A POOR EIGHTY I'M PRIORITY I MEAN THAT IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY IS A NETWORK CONGESTION OUR NETWORK WILL GIVE FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNICATIONS PRECEDENT. AND FOR PRIMARY FIRE POLICE. AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL USERS DESIGNATED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PREEMPT ALL OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TOGETHER THESE CAPABILITIES WILL BETTER CONNECT FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE CRITICAL INFORMATION THEY NEED IN AN EMERGENCY. IN ADDITION FIRST NAT AND EIGHTEEN T. WILL ELEVATE AND EVOLVE THAT NETWORK TO BENEFIT PUBLIC SAFETY. BECAUSE THE FIRST NET IS DESIGNED TO ADVANCE WITH THE SPEED OF TECHNOLOGY. THESE ADVANCES CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN CRISIS SITUATIONS FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL INFORMATION ON TRAFFIC CONDITIONS TO HELP DETERMINE THE BEST ROUTE TO AN EMERGENCY. CAN HELP SAVE CRITICAL MINUTES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET TO AN EMERGENCY. OTHER ENHANCED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS WE ARE BILL SENSORS AND CAMERAS FOR POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS CAN DELIVER IN THEIR REAR TALK. REAL TIME IMAGES OF EVENTS SUCH AS FIRES FLOODS ARE CRIMES EIGHTEEN T. IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND ADVANCES IN SMALL SMART CITIES TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN MONITOR CITIES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TRAFFIC AND LISTEN TO AND LISTEN FOR GUNSHOTS. TODAYFIRST RESPONDERS WHO ADOPT FIRST NAT AS THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE WILL OVERSEE PRIORITY AND PREEMPTION OVER THE NETWORK LOCAL CONTROL IT DEDICATED CUSTOMER CARE AND ACCESS TO FIRST NET APP STORE. AFTER NEXT MONTH WHEN THE FIRST NIGHT CORPS GOES LIVEPUBLIC SAFETY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL BREADTH OF THE FIRST NET NETWORK IN SERVICE. INCLUDING DEDICATED FIRST NET CORPS QUALITY OF SERVICE PRIORITY WITH PRIORITY LEVELS INCIDENT COMMAND UP LEFT AND END TO END SECURITY AND ENCRYPTION. AND FACT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES HAVE STARTED TO MIGRATE THEIR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO FORCE NET. THESE EARLY ADOPTERS ARE CURRENTLY USING FIRST DEBT SERVICE IS OVER THE EIGHTEEN T. COMMERCIAL NETWORK AND ANTICIPATION OF THE FIRST NET CORPS LAUNCH NEXT MONTH. PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES IN THE TAHOE AREA KINGS COUNTY TULARE COUNTY AND OTHERS ALREADY USING THIS REVOLUTIONARY NETWORK AND SERVICE. AS WE MAKE THIS INVESTMENT. IT IS WITH OUR COMMITMENT TO MEETING AND EXCEEDING ALL REQUIREMENTS TO SUBCONTRACT WORK TO VETERANS MINORITY OWNED AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES. A TNT IS AMONG THE LEADING COMPANIES IN IDENTIFYING AND DOING BUSINESS WITH DIVERSE SUPPLIERS. LAST YEAR WE SPENT FOURTEEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WITH THE DIVERSE SUPPLIERS REPRESENTING NEARLY NINETEEN PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL SUPPLIER EXPENDITURES WE HAVE BEEN RANKED NUMBER ONE FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS AND DIVERSITY ING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY SURVEY. A TNT STANDS COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION AS EVIDENCED BY AMONG OTHER THINGS I WANT ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT FORTIETH YEAR HISTORY SERVING. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY AND OUR TWENTY FIVE YEAR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THE UNIQUE NETWORKING SERVICES. THROUGH OUR WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CAL ONLY AS WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A SOLUTION THAT WILL SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY MISSION CRITICAL DATA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. A TNT WILL WORK WITH STATE LEADERSHIP AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO DELIVER THE FIRST NET NETWORK AND SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC. AND ENTITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN CONCLUSION EIGHTEEN T. COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE IS A FIRST NET TO THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIANS HORSES BINDERS AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON A CHAIR JACKSON THINK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR SANTIAGO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. THE LA RICK STORY WITH YOU. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT OUR PROJECT LA REX'S THE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. IT'S A SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH PUBLIC SAFETY USERS UTILIZING THE SYSTEM WHICH IS DEDICATED LTE SYSTEM. FOR THEIR USE AS A PRIORITY. IT PROVIDES USERS THE ABILITY. FOR DATA DAY COMMUNICATION SERVICE SAYS AS WELL AS VIDEO AND DATA ACCESS. NOW WHAT WERE SOME OF THE GOALS OF LA REX AND HAVE WE ACCOMPLISHED THEM. WHAT IS THE GOAL THEN WHAT IS THE PATH FORWARD FOR LA RAKES IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION? SOME OF THE GOALS THAT'LL LA WORKS ENVISIONED WHEN WE STOOD UP. THE AUTHORITY AND BEGAN. AWARDING THE CONTRACT FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE LYRICS IN ONLY COUNTY WAS TO ELIMINATE THE EXISTING BARRIERS. OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT EXISTED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY USERS. WE WANTED TO ELIMINATE THE BARRIERS TO ALLOW PUBLIC SAFETY TO EXPRESS ANY INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER. IN THE VERY. VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMATS BE AT DATA VIDEO. VOICE WHICH THEY HAVE PICTURES TELEMETRY MAPPING LOCATION SERVICES. WE DIDN'T WANNA LIMIT AND OPERABILITY TO VOICE ONLY. ELLIE REX IS CURRENTLY DEPLOYING A LAND MOBILE RADIO SYSTEM AS WELL AND THE LA COUNTY REGION. BUT WE UNDERSTOOD THE NEED OF INTER OPERABILITY BETWEEN THE LAND MOBILE RADIO SYSTEM. THE. PSP AND SYSTEM THE LTE SYSTEM NOW AND THE END PSP AND SYSTEM. AS WELL AS AN OPERABILITY WITH OTHER COMMERCIAL CARRIERS. ANOTHER GOAL FOR LA RAKES IN THE REGION WAS TO HAVE A RELIABLE STANDALONE COVERAGE. THE GREATER LA AREA AS MANY OF YOU NOW IS OF THE MOST DIVERSE. THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA IN THE NATION. EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION FOR PUBLIC SAFETY USERS SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED BECAUSE OF THIS DIVERSE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. AND SO THE GOAL FOR LA RICK'S IS TO PROVIDE. RELIABLE INAUDIBLE COMMUNICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FOUR THOUSAND PLUS SQUARE MILES IN LA COUNTY. THAT INCLUDED THE BASE AND THE VALLEY. THE DESERT'S THE MOUNTAINS THE FOREST AS WELL AS CATALINA ISLAND. WE ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY WITH COMMUNICATIONS THAT IMPROVE TO THEIR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. FACILITATE A COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE WHICH A LOT OF YOU SPOKE TO TODAY. OUR GOAL WAS TO SEEK TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THAT SICHUAN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. FOR USERS WHILE PROVIDING. COMMON OPERATIONAL PICTURE TO ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING. COOPERATION AND COORDINATION. RESPONSE AMONGST FIRST AND SECONDARY RESPONDERS WHEN NEEDED. WHAT IS NEXT FRAWLEY REX NOW THAT WE HAVE THE FIRST NAT I'LL? AWARDED TO EIGHTEEN ANTI. ELYRICS HAS FORMED A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH FIRST NET AND A TNT. OVER THE. US OPEN LAST YEAR'S WITH FIRST NET AZZA A USER OF THEIR SPECTRUM. AND OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH A TNT SINCE ONE OF THE CONTRACT. AND EIGHT R. ELYRICS HAS FORMALLY SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO THE FEDERAL GRAND TOUR. TO TRANSFER THE LA RICK'S ASSETS TO AND EIGHTEEN ANTI FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL DEPLOYMENT. HOWEVER WE ARE NOT HANDING OVER THE KEYS AND WALKING AWAY FROM THE REGIONAL COMMUNICATIONS. WE'VE ACTUALLY. AS A AS A ONE OF THE OTHER CONDITIONS ARE ONE OF THE S. STIPULATIONS IN THIS ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT EIGHTEEN ANTI. LA REX'S ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A PLAN AND REQUEST FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE OF FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY APPROPRIATED TO LA BRICKS IT'S APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT WE BAY CONTINUE WITH THE DEPLOYMENT CONTINUE WITH AN EXPANSION OF REGIONAL COMMUNICATIONS AND ALI COUNTY. THAT PLAN THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GRAND TOUR INCLUDES THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES WHICH WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH A TNT. A TO ENSURE SUCCESS AND INTEGRATION INTO THE NATIONAL NETWORK. THOSE THREE OBJECTIVES INCLUDE COVERAGE AUGMENTATION. SO WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A SECOND WAVE OF SITES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS AREAS WHERE EIGHTEEN T. AND L. A. REX'S OF CURRENT COVERAGE. OR EXPECT EXPERIENCING EITHER DIFFICULT IN COVERAGE OR CAPACITY. WE ARE ALSO REQUESTING AWARD OF FUNDS TO PURCHASE MAINTAIN AND DEPLOY RAPID RESPONSE VEHICLES THOSE ARE FAST REACTIONS SATELLITE TRUCKS THERE CALLED COLTS. UNITS THAT HAVE BECOME NOW MORE IMPORTANT NOW. THAT EIGHTEEN TO SUBSTANTIAL FIXED. THAT'S. SITES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THE COVERAGE ISSUES EXPERIENCED. STILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN URBAN AREAS AS YOU'VE MENTIONED AND THE AND HAVE TOUCHED UPON TODAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRES AND MUD SLIDES. THE NEED TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC SAFETY INCIDENTS BOTH WITHIN THE URBAN AREA BUT ALSO IN THE CITY IN THE. SUBSTANTIAL EVENTS THAT HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE URBAN AREA. IS SIGNIFICANT AND THUS WERE PROPOSING A. THE SELLING LIGHT TRUCKS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DEPLOY. REGIONALLY. TO AREAS WHERE THERE MAY BE ISSUES WITH COVERAGE UNDER CAPACITY. AND THEN THE THIRD OBJECTIVE THAT WE'VE PROPOSED. IS. APPLICATIONS AND PROBABILITY. THE PURPOSE. OF BUILDING THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY BROADBAND NETWORK IS TO UNITE COMMUNICATION AND PROVIDE AN INTEROPERABLE PLATFORM FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. A SOLUTION HOWEVER REQUIRES BOTH NETWORK AND APPLICATION INTEROPERABLE LADY. FIRST MEDI TNT AT ARE IMPLEMENTING THE NETWORK PLATFORM AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. FOR WORKING TO PROVIDE AN APPLICATION ECOSYSTEM WHERE THE HOSTED ENVIRONMENT A WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR USERS FOR APPLICATIONS. THE AUTHORITY THE LA RICK'S AUTHORITY. I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF PUBLIC SAFETY APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND ARE WELL POSITIONED. TO NOT ONLY TEST FUNCTIONALITY OF THESE APPLICATIONS BUT ALSO GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. THAT WILL ENSURE THE IN ARBIL. IN OPPORTUNITY AMONGST ITS USERS. THAT REQUEST FOR I GRANT AUGMENTATION IS CURRENTLY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AYE AND SO WE AWAIT. TO APPROVALS WON APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FORMAL ACID TRANSFER OF THE LA RICK'S IT THE FIFTEEN SYSTEM TO A TNT. AS WELL AS APPROVAL LOVE THE AROUND TO PLAN WE CALL THAT FOR THE REGIONAL DEPLOYMENT AND ALI BRICKS TO AUGMENT THE EXISTING. DEPLOYMENT. THANK YOU I KNEW US SENATE JACKSON HAD A QUESTION AND IF ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTION THAT I MOVE. A FINANCE OF MISS RODRIGUEZ AFTER THINKING. I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. THIS IS A HUGE CONTRACT I HOPE I STILL OWNED STOCK IN EIGHTEEN T.. SO. THE FIRST QUESTION BOMB. THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE YEAR CONTRACT WITH THERE ANY METRICS OR ANY. REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE MET IN ORDER FOR THE CONTRACT TO CONTINUE. AND WHAT ARE THOSE AND WHO WILL BE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT. THOSE METRICS ARE BEING MET. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT OF WAYS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE CONTRACT IS BEING OUT FOLLOWED IT HERE TOO SO FIRST OF ALL IT IS A FEDERAL CONTRACT. AYE THERE ARE PROCUREMENT OFFICERS FROM BOTH SIDES MANAGING THE CONTRACT MAKING SURE THAT YOU WE ISSUE APPROPRIATE TASK ORDERS AND THERE'S YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP TO ENSURE THAT THOSE TASK ORDERS ARE THOSE TASKS ARE PERFORMED. AS PART OF. WHAT WAS IN THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AS FAR AS THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BECAUSE A? CONTRACT ARE THERE DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF. ASSESSMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE SO FIRST OF ALL ARE. THE DEPLOYMENT TARGETS SO. ANY VENDOR AND THIS WAS CONDUCTED IN AN OPEN TRANSPARENT PROCESS. PRIOR TO EVEN RELEASING THE RFP WE HELD TO INDUSTRY DAYS THERE WERE SEVERAL PUBLIC NOTICES. ASKING THE COMMUNITY HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS YOU KNOW. RP BELT AND THEN THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT. SO PUBLICITY AND INDUSTRY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THAT. SO IN THE FINAL ARE P. WE LOOKED THAT PRIMARILY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS FOR ASSESSMENT THE FIRST IS THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF THE NETWORK. HOW MUCH OF THE POPULATION COVERAGE WILL THE VENDOR BE ABLE TO PROVIDE? WHETHER THAT WOULD BE BANNED FOURTEEN THAT'S THE FIRST THAT SPECTRUM THE TWENTY MEGAHERTZ OF SPECTRUM THAT THERE BE USING. BUT ALSO ANY NON BAND FOURTEEN. IMPLEMENTATIONS OR OPERATION. SO EVERY VENDOR THAT SUBMITTED A BID. HOW TO SHOW US HOW THEY WOULD BUILD OUT AND TO WHAT DEGREE THEY WOULD BUILD OUT THE NETWORK NATIONWIDE? ON THE SECOND IS ADOPTION TARGETS SOLD THE WAY CONGRESS ENVISIONED OUR PROGRAM YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST BUILD IT AND THEN IT ALL JUST LANGUISH IN NOBODY'S ACTION CAN USE IT. SO FIRST THAT CREATES AT THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY THEN CREATED ARE ASKED BIDDERS TO PROVIDE WHAT IS THERE PROJECTED ADOPTION TARGETS TO MEET THE NETWORK. NEEDS AND SHOW THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A VIABLE COMPETITIVE PRODUCT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. SO IN THE CONTRACT THERE WILL BE ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE EIGHTEEN T. HAS MET THE BUILD. OBLIGATIONS BUT ALSO ADOPTION TARGETS. AND WITHIN THAT STRUCTURE. THERE IS ALSO THIS DISTANCE THE RECALL AND DISINCENTIVE PAYMENTS SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE OUT WE ARE PROVIDING UP TO SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS EIGHTEEN T.. SHOULD ANY OF THOSE. METRICS NOT BE MET THEN THE PAYMENTS WILL BE. NOT TREATED BASICALLY. TO EIGHTEEN T.. COM SECOND AS THE FEDERAL KIND OF ENTITY LEVEL ON IN TEN YEARS FROM TWO THOUSAND ALSO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO IN THE GOVERNMENT IF ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE WILL WRITE A REPORT ON WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MEETING ARM XIN. ON AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE SO IF WE ARE NOT MAKING. ANY OF OUR TARGETS WERE ACTUALLY MEETING THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CONGRESS. THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME SORT OF REVIEW BY CONGRESS OF HOW DO. HE'LL WORK WITH FIRSTHAND MOVING FOR IT AFTER THAT. SO. IF I COULD. I JUST. YOU'VE GOT MATRIX BUT. ITEM WHICH IS KIND OF BAR DOWN LOW BUT. IF PHAM IF FIRST THAT USES THE ELEMENTS OF EIGHTEEN TEAS COMMERCIAL CELLULAR NETWORK WHICH I ASSUME IS PART OF THIS PROCESS. AND PART OF THAT NETWORK RESIDES IN THE HILLS ABOVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE ON LIKE KANSAS AND OTHER STATES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE HILLS. BUT WE DO WHEN OUR HILLS TEN BURNED. YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAW THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE SAW IT OF AT THE THOMAS FIRE. AYE IS IN THAT SYSTEM VULNERABLE TO WIDESPREAD OUTAGES AND HOW YOU HOW YOU GONNA PLAN TO. EIGHTEEN T. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PLANNED TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF YOUR SYSTEM IS. IN CALIFORNIA. SYSTEM IS STATEWIDE BUT YES I WE PART OF THE PERSON THAT. CONTRACT ANTICIPATES SIGNIFICANT BUILD OUT SIGNIFICANT BUILD OUT FOR ADDITIONAL COVERAGE AND FOR HARDENING OF THE OF THE NETWORK THAT. THAT HAD BEEN TALKED ABOUT EARLIER I THINK SENATOR I GO I CURRY ASKED. YOUR. OUR COLLEAGUES AT CAL OH YES WHAT TOOK SO LONG IN THE NEGOTIATIONS TO. LEADING UP TO THIS OP ED AND I'D ALL ALL START OUT BY SAYING YOU HAVE VERY GOOD REPRESENTATIVES REPRESENTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENSURING THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST. THAT WERE ABLE TO OFFER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY THEY YOU THEY KNOW VERY INTIMATELY. THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY AND THEY ARE. NEGOTIATING QUITE WELL ON YOUR BEHALF AND THAT NEGOTIATION IS INCLUDES AS THEY STATE THAT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES BEING DEPLOYED TOWARDS HEARTENING THAT WORKS IN ANTICIPATION THAT MANY OF THESE. CELL TOWERS MIGHT BE VULNERABLE TO FIRES. SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM HUNDREDS OF THESE NEW TELL A. THOUSAND. I THOUSAND. PLUS TOWERS OUGHT TO BE BUILT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO AUGMENT THE IS THE EXISTING NETWORK AND MANY OF THOSE. HEARTENING TO THE STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED IN CONTRACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN FACT. RESILIENT. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIA. SO IT WILL FIRST NET INSURER THAT OR ADVOCATE THAT EIGHTEEN TEAM MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE LISTED IN. MR GILLER DO CHEESE LETTER WITH RESPECT TO THESE ISSUES THOSE THREE AREAS. OBVIOUSLY HE WAS VERY HAPPY. AYE THAT THESE HAD NOT BEEN RESOLVED IN THE TIME IT RIGHT NOW I MEAN. IT'S ONE OF THOSE SORT OF HOBSON'S CHOICE WILL GET COME DIVE IT OR PARTICIPATE IN A NATIONAL SYSTEM I WILL THROW SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE POT. OR CHOOSE NOT TO WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN RIGHT MEAN YEAH I MEAN. FIRST THE THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY COULD HAVE EASILY SPENT SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS HERE JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE A A NATIONWIDE PROGRAM. THE STATE PLAN THAT POLICIES RECEIVED WERE. A DEPICTION OF WHAT THE FIRST NET NETWORK WILL BE IN THE FIRST INITIAL PHASE OF. DEPLOYMENT SO REALLY WHAT THAT IS IS BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR CONTRACT. SO THIS IS NOT THIS IS TO SAY THAT WHAT ALL THIS EACH RECEIVED IS NOT THE FINAL AND ONLY AND POINT IN WHAT THE. AND PSP AND WILL LOOK LIKE SO THEY'LL BE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OF THE COVER AND THERE WILL BE AN EIGHTEEN T. IS JUST THE REGULAR COURSE OF BUSINESS WILL BE AUGMENTING ENDING. BUILDING CAPACITY TO THEIR NETWORK MUCH APPRECIATE BUT WILL YOU ON BEHALF OF FIRST NAT. EITHER ENSURE ADVOCATE THAT EIGHTEEN T. MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE YES THAT ANSWER OKAY AT A GOOD ANSWER ADDITIONAL SENATE I I THINK I HAVE TO SAY THAT. THERE ALSO PENALTIES THAT ARE IN PLACE. HAS WON THE CONTRACT IN ASSUMING THAT ANY PEOPLE TO NETWORK AND NO ONE SHOWS UP I MEAN SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER AND AND. IN ORDER TO. INSURE USAGE OF THE NETWORK OR PENALTIES WILL BE PAID BY EIGHTEEN T. SURE AN AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE CHOSETO YOU KNOW WE'VE. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS FOR RESILIENCY IN REDUNDANCY AND PRE POSITIONING THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO SAVING LIVES IN THIS CALIFORNIA. THESE APART THE LESSONS THAT GOD FOR BID WE'VE HAD TO LEARN AND I JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT. THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROGRAM EVERY STATE HAS ITS OWN SET OF ISSUES WE'VE SEEN WHAT SOME OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA. DIRECTED KILLER DO CHIA ARTICULATED THEM I THINK FAIRLY EMPHATICALLY IN WELL AND I JUST. SO FOR THE MONEY IN THE CONTRIBUTION AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS IMPORTANT. I THINK TO ALL OF US AND CERTAINLY. I GUESS I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF THAT WE IMPLEMENT. THIS PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AS WE'VE SEEN THEM THROUGH THESE VARIOUS. TRAGIC EVENTS IN AND CATASTROPHES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED OVER THE COURSE OF TIME SO I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT. EIGHTEEN TIAS. YOU KNOW WORKING ON THIS SOME STATES THOUGH IT HAD BETTER SYSTEMS IN PLACE THAN OTHERS CALIFORNIA HAS PROBABLY BEEN IN THE LEAD NATIONWIDE IN TERMS OF. OUR OF MANAGEMENT OF OF THESE. DISASTER OF VANCE XIN IN BETWEEN THE FLOODING IN THE WILDFIRES IN THE EARTHQUAKES THAT WE HAVE WE BEEN PRETTY MUCH ON TOP OF THIS AND SO THE LAST QUESTION IS. WILL THE FIRST NET NETWORK UNDER EIGHTEEN TEE ABBY PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE GIVEN THAT I LA RICK'S. ó NETWORK. THAT EIGHTEEN TIAS AQUIRED IS A PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE ARE YOU GOING TO COMMIT TO THAT AS WELL. WELL WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTING TO WORK WITH TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CAL AWAY AS TO IDENTIFY THOSE SITES THAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE. TO BE. ARE REQUIRED TO BE OF F A TO BE HARDENED. AND YES WE'VE COMMITTED TO HARDING THOSE SITES. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MISS RODRIGUEZ FOLLOWED BY A. THIS GAINES. SUCH JUST QUESTION REGARDING. WITH. WITH THIS NEXT GENERATION OF COMMUNICATIONS. AS OUR WAY WOULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT OFFICE YOU WOULD KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FLOODS THE FIRES THE EARTHQUAKES. SO THE SYSTEM WILL GO DOWN VENTURE THE CELL TOWERS NAM LINES INTERNET. IS DURING AWAY WE CAN GO TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION WHEN WORST CASE AND ARE ALL THAT STUFF GOES DOWN. CAN WE MAINTAIN. COMMUNICATION WITH OF ALL SYSTEMS GO DOWN IS OR SOME TYPE OF BACKUP PLAN. I KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT THEY HAVE THEIR. RESPONSE. TRUCKS BEAN GOT THERE AND SET UP BUT THE MEANTIME AND EVERYTHING'S WIPED OUT BECAUSE OF THE FIRE THE FLUTTERED EARTHQUAKE. IS OUR WAY WE CAN STILL MAINTAIN. WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. OR WILL THE REAR IS OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR THE. THEY THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS ORDER I GUESS. IN YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ANTICIPATE. WHATEVER COULD HAPPEN BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT AGAIN. THOSE NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY ARE TRYING TO ANTICIPATE THE MANY DISASTERS THAT CAN AND WILL ACCORD HAVE OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY HAND IN GLOVE WITH THEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM GOING FOR IT AND SOME OF THE WORK SOME OF THE THE HARDENING THAT A SENATOR JACKSON'S JUST MENTIONED IS BEING DONE THAT HELPS THAT'S PART OF THE SOLUTION. PART OF THE SOLUTION ALSO NEGOTIATED BY YOUR REPRESENTATIVES A CALLER WE ASK AS A LARGER. NUMBER OF DEPLOYED UNITS. THE AND AND MOST STATES HAVE UNDERSTANDING THE PROPENSITY FOR NATURAL DISASTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THE RESILIENCY OF THE NETWORK TO ENSURE THAT TIME DOUBT IS MINIMIZE. ANOTHER THAT AGAIN YOUR NEGOTIATORS ARE ARE ARE AYE I'VE BEEN SUPPORTING AS WELL IS ADDITIONAL. SUPPORT. GENERATORS AROUND NETWORKED AYE EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON AS WELL SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. ALTERNATIVES IN ADDITION TO JUST BUILDING OUT MORE CAPACITY IN GENERAL THESE ALL WORK TOGETHER IN COMBINATION TO ENSURE THAT OUT ITS TIMES ARE CUT TO AN ANIMAL. CAN WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS NEVER EVER GOING TO BE AN OUTAGE KNOW WHAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE AN OUTAGE IT'S GOING TO BE AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE AND IMPACTING THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. AND WITHOUT SAID IS OUR WAY WE COULD. MINIMIZE THAT IMPACT OR WE HAVE. MAYBE SOME CERTAIN TYPES OF GUIDELINES THAT WITHIN. AN AREA THAT WHEN EVERYTHING GOES DOWN WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT. WITHIN FOUR TO SIX HOURS ON OUR THAT WILL HAVE THE BACK UP WITH THERE'S THE GENERATOR WITH THE TRUCKS THE MOBILE TRUCKS OUT THERE SET UP SO COMMUNICATIONS COULD BE. UP AND RUNNING ESERVER ANYTHING TALK ABOUT. COMING UP WITH THE PLAN AYE RESPONSE TIME FOR. THOSE ARE SERVICES TAKEOVER DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S THAT WHILE I KNOW WE WE ARE SO WE ARE CERTAINLY WORKING ON. AND. AND BACK UP GENERATOR TIME. YEAH HOW LONG WILL IT HOW WE'RE RUN WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR INSTANCE OF COURSE IN INSTANCES WHERE THE ENTIRE ENTIRE TOWERS DOWN CERTAINLY THERE THEY'RE GONNA BE CHALLENGES THEY ARE BUT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. WITH YOUR REPRESENTATIVES ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES TO INTERMENT TO AGAIN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MEANT AS AN. AS MINIMAL A LOSS AS POSSIBLE. CREE YEAH THANK YOU. TO THE PANELISTS I APPRECIATE YOUR OR YOUR INPUT TODAY AND. I WAS JUST WONDERING IF. MISTER MCNEALY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME. WITH ISSUES RELATED MY DISTRICT I'VE GOT A VERY RURAL DISTRICTS NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. THAT'S ALMOST SEVEN TIMES CITED SIZE LA COUNTY GEOGRAPHICALLY. AND A LOT A LOT OF WELL WILDFIRE EXPOSURE LOT OF FORESTS. AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET. CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE HARDENING ASPECT. WOULD YOU MIND EXPANDING A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT MEANS AND THEN. IS THERE ALSO GOING TO BE. MORE MORE BUT DEFAULT. FEATURE SO THAT IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE. A TARA GO DOWN. WE MIGHT HAVE MORE MORE TOWERS PER SQUARE MILE OR WHATEVER. SO THAT IN THE EVENT YOU HAVE A A SMALLER REGIONAL FIRE. YOU STILL HAVE COMMUNICATION ABILITY. BECAUSE. OF THE DIP HAVE. NATURE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. SURE CHERISH THE GAINES I THINK ONE OF THE. I THINK GOT SENATOR JACKSON USE THE TERM. WHEN I GO I USE THE TERM HARDING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY GREAT I THINK SENATOR JACKSON USE THAT TERM. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YES WE'RE NEGOTIATING WITH CAL WE ASKED TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST IN PARTICULAR AREAS WHERE THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES YES. WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT. HARDENING IN THAT FASHION THEIR AND THEIR NUMBER OF WAYS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HARDENING. IT IT IT IT. THAT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THEIR HOURS. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. PROTECTIONS AROUND THAT PARTICULAR PHYSICAL STRUCTURE THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MORE RESILIENT TO. ACTS OF GOD FOR INSTANCE. BUT TO I ALSO ADDRESS YOUR IT DO YOUR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE TO CLEAN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROGRAM WORKS HAND IN HAND WITH ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT EIGHTEEN TO HAVE BUILT ITSELF UP AND THAT'S THE CAL ADAPT THE. CAN'T TO THE. AND. THE DEAD APPROACH THAT OUT ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND INTO WORLD AREAS OF OF THE STATE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A WORLD HOUSEHOLDS THAT WILL BE COVERED BY THIS BILL DOT AS WELL WHICH IS HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE BUILD OUT. OF. UNDER. UNDER OF THE FIRST THAT PROGRAM AS WELL SO WHEN WE TALK IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR YOU THIS IS PART OF THE REDUNDANCY PICTURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT. PARTICULAR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE IF ONE TOWER GOES DOWN YES WE CAN REROUTE IN FACT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES WE WERE ABLE TO REROUTE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF. OF OF. OF OF CALLS ARE FROM TOWERS THAT HAD GONE DOWN PARTICULARLY WHERE THE FIBER HAS NOT THE FIBER BACK CALL IS NOT BEEN IMPLICATED WE CAN REROUTE INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR. GREAT WONDERFUL I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE CAN MAKE THIS MUCH MORE ROBUST AND. HOPEFULLY. USE BETTER MANAGEMENT. PRACTICES FOR FOREST'S IT'S ALL INTEGRATED AND. I THINK THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL. FOR US AS LEGISLATORS SO. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. YOUR GREAT ADVICE.
