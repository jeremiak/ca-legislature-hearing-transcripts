IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.547
RECESSION. SO ALL OTHER CAMPUSES

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.182
WERE BUILT ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:23.284
STATE MONEY. MUCH OF UC MERCED

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:24.652

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.020
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAMPUS

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.354
DIVERSE CAMPUS IN THE UC SYSTEM

MERCED IS ALSO ENROLLED THE

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.434
HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.102
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN THE UC

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:17.405

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.257
THIS DESPITE BEING FORCED TO

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.758
OVERCOME BIAS AND UNDER

ONLY REFERRAL CAMPUSES IN THE UC

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.980

ACCEPTED TO THEIR CAMPUS OF

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:06.387
CHORES. THE L. A- THEN SUGGESTS

01:32:06.454 --> 01:32:07.722
AS A REMEDY GIVEN THE OTHER

CAMPUSES MORE MONEY TO REDUCE

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:12.326
REFERRALS BUT MAKES NO MENTION

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:13.961
OF THE FACT THE UC MERCED HAS

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:14.929
THE SMALLEST BUDGET OF ANY OTHER

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:17.164

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:31.679
EXPANDING ENROLLMENT IN ROLLING

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:33.581

PERRANCE ATHLETICALLY OFTENTIMES

02:23:54.058 --> 02:23:56.094
THAT FEMALE PARENTS SINCE THE

SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:11.275

FOR THE WHOLE AND HAVE MADE SOME

02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:14.345
STRIDES OVER THE YEARS THAT WE

02:24:14.412 --> 02:24:16.447
HAVE BEEN HERE BUT NOT ENOUGH-

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:17.682

BEING WORKED ON UP THERE AS WELL

02:24:19.450 --> 02:24:20.985

02:24:34.899 --> 02:24:36.134
CHILD AT LEAST EVERY YEAR THAT

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.202
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR TEN YEAR AND-

02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:39.937

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:45.510
WITH THE TIME HERE- HOW MUCH

02:24:45.576 --> 02:24:47.078

02:24:48.746 --> 02:24:50.248
THEM IT'S DIFFERENT LEVELS AND I

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:51.983
HAVE SUBMIT ENOUGH- THEY CAN

02:24:52.050 --> 02:24:53.251

AND SECONDARY. SCHOOL BOARDS TO

03:54:04.597 --> 03:54:06.799
SUBJECT TO A COMPLIANCE SO WITH

03:54:06.866 --> 03:54:10.669
THIS IS A PROVISIONS- NO MATTER

03:54:10.736 --> 03:54:16.008
HOW GREAT YES C. A. CALL. BUT IF

PLEASE EXACTING PROFIT THE IS.

03:54:18.144 --> 03:54:31.524
SO OFTEN HEIAU EDUCATION. RIGHT

03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:39.365
THE DECISION YEAH EXISTENCE. YES

03:54:39.432 --> 03:54:44.170
THANK YOU WE- WELL YOUR OVERALL

03:54:44.236 --> 03:54:46.705
QUESTION I THINK IS RELATED TO

03:54:46.772 --> 03:54:48.974
ALL PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THE

03:54:49.041 --> 03:54:53.279
EXCEPT READ OUR UNIVERSITY

03:54:53.345 --> 03:55:01.287
COLLEGES- IN THAT LAST TWO. THIS

03:55:01.353 --> 03:55:02.955
ARGUMENT WELL WELL THERE QUALITY

03:55:03.022 --> 03:55:05.257
IN THAT WORST DAY IN THE WORLD

03:55:05.324 --> 03:55:08.360
TWO YEARS AGO JUST AS BAD FOR

03:55:08.427 --> 03:55:11.597
YOU KNOW THEY MICHAEL WAS IT WAS

03:55:11.664 --> 03:55:14.533
TO NOT GO CROSS. OTHER SCHOOL IN

03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:19.104
THE SAME BLOCK. CAN WE DO IT ALL

03:55:19.171 --> 03:55:20.873
. RELATED TO THE PUBLIC WELL

03:55:20.940 --> 03:55:22.408
WELFARE RELAY TO OUR SCHOOL SO I

03:55:22.475 --> 03:55:23.809
THOUGHT THAT IT WASN'T

03:55:23.876 --> 03:55:25.244
APPROPRIATE TO TWO DIFFERENT

03:55:25.311 --> 03:55:28.514
SHAPE HOWEVER I THINK FOR THE OF

03:55:28.581 --> 03:55:31.050
THIS YEAR CITY THAT THE DRUG

03:55:31.116 --> 03:55:32.751
ISSUE FOR MANY. WHERE A DRESSING

03:55:32.818 --> 03:55:35.087
THAT RELATE TO. BECAUSE OF THE

03:55:35.154 --> 03:55:37.556
CIVIC CENTER HERE. IF I JUST

03:55:37.623 --> 03:55:40.326
MIGHT ADD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

03:55:40.392 --> 03:55:42.361
CURRENTLY TITLE EIGHT THAT HAS

03:55:42.428 --> 03:55:44.330
CURRENTLY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING

03:55:44.396 --> 03:55:46.365
VENTILATION SYSTEMS AN H. BACK

03:55:46.432 --> 03:55:48.033
AND HOW OFTEN THEY NEED TO BE

03:55:48.100 --> 03:55:51.070
INSPECTED. APPLIES TO ALL.

03:55:51.136 --> 03:55:53.272
SCHOOLS BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

03:55:53.339 --> 03:55:55.140
SILVERY WERE INCREASING THE

03:55:55.207 --> 03:55:57.643
STANDARD IT JUST IT JUST MADE

03:55:57.710 --> 03:56:00.012
SENSE TO CONTINUE AND APPLY THAT

03:56:00.079 --> 03:56:02.715
STANDARD AS IT DOES TO. TO ALL

03:56:02.781 --> 03:56:05.885
SCHOOLS. AND MY SECOND QUESTION

03:56:05.951 --> 03:56:09.421
IS- YOU WILL BE A LOT HOW ARE

03:56:09.488 --> 03:56:11.490
YOUR STANDARD DAHLE. A

03:56:11.557 --> 03:56:14.260
DIFFERENCE WILL BE UP BETWEEN TO

03:56:14.326 --> 03:56:20.266
MY TO MY UNDERSTANDING. LOCAL.

03:56:20.332 --> 03:56:22.034
AUTHORITY SELECTED CITIES AND

03:56:22.101 --> 03:56:25.871
COUNTIES THEY DO HAVE- BUILDING-

03:56:25.938 --> 03:56:30.843
SPECS AND- REQUIREMENTS. AND

03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:32.177
JUST LIKE THE MAINTAINING

03:56:32.244 --> 03:56:37.650
ELEVATORS. AND SO- YOUR BILL IS-

03:56:37.716 --> 03:56:40.085
TRYING TO MAKE UP A SOMETHING

03:56:40.152 --> 03:56:42.521
THAT IS NOT THE COVER THE BY NOT

03:56:42.588 --> 03:56:48.661
LOCAL LAW. AUTHORITIES STANDARDS

03:56:48.727 --> 03:56:52.965
. YES IT'S A MEMBERS SO THE-

03:56:53.032 --> 03:56:56.268
TITLE LATE IS A STATE WIDE

03:56:56.335 --> 03:56:59.605
STANDARD IT'S THE LOCALS DON'T

03:56:59.672 --> 03:57:01.106
HAVE SEPARATE STANDARDS

03:57:01.173 --> 03:57:04.343
REGARDING THE- TITLE EIGHT. THE

03:57:04.410 --> 03:57:07.279
PROBLEM WITH LATE IN REFERENCE

03:57:07.346 --> 03:57:10.482
TO VENTILATION STANDARDS IS IT A

03:57:10.549 --> 03:57:15.654
RIG IT REQUIRES THEM TO BE

03:57:15.721 --> 03:57:19.892
INSPECTED.

03:57:19.959 --> 03:57:22.661
DO YOU FEAR WITH THOSE ONCE THE

03:57:22.728 --> 03:57:26.599
YEAR INSPECTIONS BUT FOLLOW WHAT

ASHTRAY DANDER. IT THAT AT LEAST

03:57:30.669 --> 03:57:32.471
ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS YOU NEED A

03:57:32.538 --> 03:57:35.708
MORE IN DEPTH INSPECTION. THAT

03:57:35.774 --> 03:57:38.844
IS MORE DETAILED- AND DID THAT

03:57:38.911 --> 03:57:40.546
IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOW THAT

03:57:40.613 --> 03:57:42.615
WE LIVE IN THE AIR OF COVE IT

03:57:42.681 --> 03:57:45.017
AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN TITLE. IT IS

03:57:45.084 --> 03:57:46.619
CURRENT FORM WAS ADOPTED IT WAS

03:57:46.685 --> 03:57:48.520
EASY YOU KNOW YEARS BEFORE WE

03:57:48.587 --> 03:57:51.490
HAD A COVERT PANDEMIC. SO THIS

03:57:51.557 --> 03:57:52.992
BILL APPOINTED BY ITSELF WHAT

03:57:53.058 --> 03:57:55.461
THOUGHT MORE. OF ONE THE

03:57:55.527 --> 03:57:58.964
INSPECTION ORDER FOR IN NUMBERS

03:57:59.031 --> 03:58:01.266
. IT DOESN'T IN WE HAVE A

03:58:01.333 --> 03:58:02.034
TECHNICAL EXPERT WHO CAN

03:58:02.101 --> 03:58:03.736
DESCRIBE BUT THE ASH THE

MORE COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION

03:58:09.441 --> 03:58:11.810
DELINEATES PRESCRIPTIVE. EXACTLY

ARE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU

03:58:58.190 --> 03:58:59.858
DO NEW CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE

03:58:59.925 --> 03:59:02.127
TODAY TECHSYSTEMS WORK. WHEN IS

03:59:02.194 --> 03:59:04.096
. BOB SO FORTH IN THE FORWARD

03:59:04.163 --> 03:59:05.698
THIS IS NOW ARE YOU FIVE YEARS

03:59:05.764 --> 03:59:07.800
YOU'RE GONNA REDO THAT BECAUSE

WE KNOW SOME YOU KNOW WITHIN

03:59:09.368 --> 03:59:10.736
THREE YEARS MOST OF THE SYSTEMS

BETTER THING WOULD BE FOR THEM

03:59:27.886 --> 03:59:30.022
TO DO IT EVERY YEAR BUT WE JUST

03:59:30.089 --> 03:59:32.291

EVERYTHING IS SO IMPACTED THAT

04:00:23.709 --> 04:00:26.645
DOES SO REALLY AIRCONDITIONING

TWO THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION

04:00:42.528 --> 04:00:43.896
OF CO TWO. AT THAT POINT A

04:00:43.962 --> 04:00:44.797
TRAINED TECHNICIAN CAN COME IN

04:00:44.863 --> 04:00:46.231
AND IT JUST THE VENTILATION

04:00:46.298 --> 04:00:48.700
SYSTEM REPLACE FILTERS TAKE

04:00:48.767 --> 04:00:51.069
SEVERAL DIFFERENT- ACTIONS TO

ADJUST THE SYSTEM THE AIRFLOW SO

04:00:54.139 --> 04:00:56.675
THAT THEY CAN THEN MITIGATE-

04:00:56.742 --> 04:01:00.879
THAT HIGH LEVEL OF CARBON

04:01:00.946 --> 04:01:02.381
MONOXIDE THAT'S THAT'S- WHAT

04:01:02.447 --> 04:01:06.852
THIS. IF YOU HAVE. AND MANAGED

04:01:06.919 --> 04:01:07.953
SYSTEM JUST LIKE IN THIS

04:01:13.725 --> 04:01:16.028
PUT IN THE HIGHEST FILTRATION

04:01:16.094 --> 04:01:17.262
THAT'S POSSIBLE THAT SYSTEM CAN

04:01:17.329 --> 04:01:20.232
HANDLE MARC THIRTEEN AND THAT

04:01:20.299 --> 04:01:22.034
PROSTRATION IS WHAT PROTECTS YOU

04:01:22.100 --> 04:01:24.069
FROM NOW THE SMOKE OUTSIDE HERE

04:01:24.136 --> 04:01:26.905
OR FINING AND THEY GO BACK IN

04:01:26.972 --> 04:01:29.708
SOME OF THE SCHOOLS. THE FILTERS

04:01:29.775 --> 04:01:31.410
AND EVEN THEIR- ANNOUNCER THIS

04:01:31.476 --> 04:01:32.911

CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW

04:01:34.313 --> 04:01:35.180
EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE THAT SO
