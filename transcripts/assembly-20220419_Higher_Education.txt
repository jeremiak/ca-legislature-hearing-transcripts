FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH US. AND WE'RE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS- WHICH BETTER ELABORATE THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND CLEAN ENERGY POLICY. WE'VE SEVERAL AMBITIOUS DEADLINES SUCH AS REDUCING OUR MISSIONS BY 40% FROM NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY. HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR I STATED THAT WE ARE FAILING SHORT OF THESE GOALS. ADDITIONALLY A STATE BY PEARSON REVEALED THAT SCHOOLS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT CLIMATE. AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 54% FEEL UNQUALIFIED TO WORK IN A CLEAN ENERGY JOB AND TO GET THE PERCENT BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY. TO FUND THESE TRAININGS AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN WILL HELP ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY CREATING. THE LACC DE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION THE CENTER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING A BLUEPRINT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE CURRICULA AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL ALSO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL CLIMATE. EDUCATION RESOURCES FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. FINALLY IT WILL FACILITATE HANDS ON JOB TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREEN JOBS. AND CAREERS. THE CENTER WILL BE ESTABLISHED AT WEST LA COLLEGE. WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE STATE THAT OFFERS A CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES ASSOCIATES DEGREE. WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT. BECAUSE OF ITS PROXIMITY TO THE INGLEWOOD OIL FIELD THE LARGEST URBAN OIL FIELD IN THE COUNTRY. AND ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD AND IT'S HOME TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO HAVE COME FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACT. IMPACTED BY ADVERSE CLIMATE CHANGE EXPERIENCES. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO CLOSING WITH OILFIELD. BY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AS WE INTO THE PROCESS OF PHASING OUT THIS FIELD. AND OTHERS THE CENTER'S PURPOSE IS GOING TO BECOME EVEN MORE. EVIDENT THE CITY WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE TRANSITIONING INTO CLEAN JOBS SUSTAINABLE FUTURES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SENATE THIS PARTICULAR CAMPUS WILL ALLOW FOR A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY OUR DOCTOR FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ CHANCER OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNICATORS. A DISTRICT IN JB BOMB A CURRENT STUDENT AT WEST LA COLLEGE. WELCOME DOCTOR RODRIGUEZ.

LACC THE 60% OF OUR STUDENT BODY COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND 53% OF OUR L. A. C. CITY STUDENTS LIVE AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR ROLE AS ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS STUDENTS AND AS ADVOCATES FOR CLEAN WATER AND CLEAN AIR WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE AS NOTED IS THE ONLY COMMITTEE COLLEGE THAT OFFERS A CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES ASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE. AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN AMPLIFIES THIS DEGREE BY ESTABLISHING THE L. A. C. CITY CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION AND WITH COURSES BEING OFFERED VIRTUALLY.

I CHOSE WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE SPECIFICALLY FOR PERSONAL KIND QUITE PRIVATE PROGRAM WITHOUT WHICH A NEURO DIVERGENT STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF MAY NEVER HAVE THE SUPPORT. OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE WEST LOS ANGELES CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM FOSTERS A DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF THE LEARNERS FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY.

I HIT YOU TWICE ALL RIGHT. AND THAT IS. A. B. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. YES SIR. THANK YOU AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS LEGISLATION WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF ENCOURAGING AND THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO REFINE THIS BILL- BEYOND THIS HEARING I'M HERE TODAY TODAY TO PRESENT A BILL THAT WILL CREATE PIPELINES THE QUALITY JOBS UPWARD MOBILITY AND INCOME SECURITY FOR THOSE EXITING INCARCERATION IN ENTERING THE SCHOOL PIPELINE IN A COMMUNICATIVE STRIX. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THE HIGHER UP FROM CORRECTION TO CAREER STATEMENT PILOT PROGRAM IS INNOVATIVE. ACCORDING TO THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF RECIDIVISM. DECIMATED THAT ONE IN THREE ADULTS HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD IN UP 275% OF THOSE WITH PAST JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT ARE STILL UNEMPLOYED A YEAR AFTER THE ACCIDENT CAR SERRATION. MANY MORE UNDER EMPLOYED EVEN IF THEY FIND JOBS YEARS AFTER EXITING INCARCERATION. CONSIDERING THE RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS POPULATION IT'S UNSURPRISING THAT THE TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT BY CDC ARE FROM THE 28% OF CALIFORNIANS ON HOUSE POPULATION REPORT HAVING RECENTLY BEEN RELEASED. FROM INCARCERATION. THE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS ARE MANY. IN ADDITION THE TO THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS TO PREVENT SOME PEOPLE FROM ENTERING CERTAIN PROFESSIONS. PEOPLE COMING FROM THE CAR SERRATION ALSO FACE A STIGMA HELD STILL BY EMPLOYERS. AGGRESSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS. AND OFTEN LACK MARKETABLE TRAINING AND SKILLS. FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE FACTORS ARE COMPOUNDED BY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THAT ALREADY PERVADES AND OUR LABOR MARKET. HOWEVER THE COST OF CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO PREVENT MANY FROM TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THESE RESOURCES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED IN OUR COMMUNICATIVE STRICT. THAT ARE WORKING HARD TO SKILL UP TO TRAIN UP AND TO FIND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. BUT STILL AS YOU'RE LEARNING THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE SITTING THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH. PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE A RELIABLE FOR SOURCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT REENTRY SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA IS QUICKLY INCREASING. THE HIGHER UP STARTED PROGRAM PROPOSED IN THIS BILL MAYBE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED STUDENTS. WHO CAN DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO EDUCATION AND CAREER TRAINING WITHOUT SACRIFICING THEIR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD HOUSING AND CHILDCARE. THE HIGHER UPS TYPING WILL REIMBURSE JUSTICE INVOLVES STUDENTS AT THE RATE OF THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE FOR EVERY HOUR THEY SPEND IN CLASS TRAINING AND SKILLING UP. AS A STIPULATION FOR RECEIVING THE STAFF AND STUDENTS WILL BE PARTICIPATING THE RISING SCHOLARS NETWORKS AT THEIR SCHOOL. THE RISING SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS A DATA DRIVEN TESTED APPROACH TO RE ENTRY IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES GUIDED ACADEMIC PATHWAYS. FOR PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS COUPLED WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY A LONG TERM APPROACH. ROOTED IN CARE NOT INCARCERATION AND REENTERED THE REINTEGRATION. RE INTEGRATION REDUCES RECIDIVISM INCREASES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. BY LINKING THE HIGHER UPS TYPE INTO EXISTING REENTRY SUPPORT OF SERVICES. THAT FOLLOW STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY AND INTO THE WORKFORCE. THIS POTENTIAL STATEMENT HAS THE- HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT COUNTLESS STUDENTS ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM OR PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED CAN ARE LEAVING THE INCARCERATION PIPELINE AND HEADED INTO THE EDUCATION PIPELINE AND THEN INTO OUR WORKFORCE PIPELINE. I'M JOINED HERE TODAY AGAIN BY CHANCELLOR FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ OF THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL BUT ALSO GREG FIDEL THE POLICY DIRECTOR. AT INITIATE JUSTICE. THANK YOU THIS MEMBER BRIAN FOR YOUR- INCREDIBLE I THINK OF CARE ON THIS ISSUE. AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. GERMANY NINE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD I'M DOCTOR FRANCISCO TO THE GUESTS CHANCE OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE I A BILL THAT IS COSPONSORED BY THE LA COMMITTEE COLORS DISTRICT AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN COLLABORATION WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERVISOR HOLLY MITCHELL. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ESTABLISHES AS WAS NOTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN A FIVE YEAR HIRE A PILOT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES CHANCES OFFICE TO PROVIDE STIPENDS FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN AN EDUCATIONAL OR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM ANY ONE OF THE STATE'S COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THIS BILL CREATES PIPELINES THE QUALITY JOBS UPWARD ECONOMIC MOBILITY OR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UNIVERSITY TRANSFER AND THROUGH THE STIPENDS THE NECESSARY AND STABILIZE IN INCOME SECURITY FOR THOSE EXITING INCARCERATION. FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS FACE MANY BARRIERS IN ACQUIRING LONG TERM STABLE EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING DISCRIMINATORY HIRING PRACTICES AND LIMITED ACCESS TO FULL TIME WELL PAYING JOBS MANY EMPLOYERS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. USE BACKGROUND CHECKS TO SCREEN FOR APPLICANTS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED CALIFORNIANS TO GET A FRESH START. IN ADDITION THE RISING COSTS OF EDUCATION OR CAREER TRAINING CONTINUES TO PREVENT MANY FROM TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS. THE LOS SANTOS COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT EARLIER ROLES ABOUT A THOUSAND SELF IDENTIFIED FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS BUT WE SUSPECT THIS NUMBER TO BE MUCH HIGHER. FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS HAVE ADDITIONAL HURDLES IN COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UPWARD ECONOMIC MOBILITY ARE KEYS TO REHABILITATION AND TO REDUCING RECIDIVISM. L. A. C. CITY HAS ESTABLISHED SEVERAL INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FOR THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS AN EXAMPLE IS A LOGISTICS EDUCATION AND CAREER PROGRAM A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PROBATION. AND UPS THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES YOUTH L. A. COUNTY JUVENILE PROBATION CAMPS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A CERTIFICATE IN LEADERSHIP IN GLOBAL LOGISTICS SKILLS. EMILY UPON RELEASE THESE STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYMENT WITH UPS APPROXIMATE HUNDRED TWENTY YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THIS PROGRAM HAD BEEN HIRED BY U. P. S. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ENABLES CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BETTER SERVE JUSTICE INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS BY ESTABLISHING A FIVE YEAR EDUCATIONAL STIPEND PILOT PROGRAM. WITH ALL THE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR STUDENT SUCCESS THIS POLYENABLES COMMITTEE COLLEGES TO DEMONSTRATE PROOF OF CONCEPT AND PROVIDE STUDENTS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL STABILITY WHILE THEY ARE ROLLED IN A DEGREE SEEKING A CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. AT ANY CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE AB. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IS A PRUDENT INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE THAT GOES BEYOND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR A VULNERABLE. POPULATION IT HAS THE ADDED POTENTIAL TO LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY AND REDUCE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAR SERRATION AND RECIDIVISM FOR THESE REASONS THE LOS ANGE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT.

THANK YOU CHANCELLOR ARE YOU AT THE SECOND- SUPPORT THE WITNESS GO AHEAD YES SIR THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG FIDEL AND I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR INITIATE JUSTICE.

JEWEL'S THESE BARRIERS MAKE IT HARDER TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY AND SUPPORT THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. DESPITE THESE BARRIERS WE WORK EVERY DAY WITH FOLKS WHO ARE TRANSFORMING THEIR LIVES. FINANCIAL STABILITY OR LACK THERE OF IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST INDICATORS OF RECIDIVISM THUS THE STABLE EMPLOYMENT IN UPWARD MOBILITY ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTI RECIDIVISM TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THE STATE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY OUTCOMES FOR ALL. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THESE INDIVIDUALS ACHIEVE FINANCIAL STABILITY THIS COLLEGE I ASSUME THE MAJORITY THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TODAY ARE HERE IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS THAT THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION TREATMENT SET THEM UP FOR. I MYSELF AM A PROUD PRODUCT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THIS BILL IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE JUSTICE INVOLVES STUDENTS AND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE SAME BENEFITS. THE STATE BEEN THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES A INSERTED THEIR SET UP FOR SUCCESS WHICH AGAIN IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF EVERYONE. WE NEED TO ENSURE FOLKS THAT ARE LEAVING INCARCERATION ARE ANY COMPETITIVE SALARIES NOT SCRAPING BY ON MINIMUM WAGE A POVERTY WAGES.

TWENTY FORTY SIX VERY PERSONAL BILL FOR ME WHICH IS TABLETS IS THE INLAND RISING FUND FOR THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE AT UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED. CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL KNOW IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. BUT THESE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE NOT SHARED BY ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE AS 70% OF JOB GROWTH HAS BEEN IN COASTAL CITIES. THIS LACK OF EQUITY BEGINS AT OUR SCHOOLS LAST YEAR MY HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER THE PRESS ENTERPRISE REPORTED THAT UC RIVERSIDE RECEIVES THE LOWEST AMOUNT OF PER STUDENT. ON A PER STUDENT BASIS IN OF ANY OF THE UC CAMPUSES. THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT 62% OF THE UC SYSTEM STATE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO CAMPUS ON BASE TO A STUDENT ENROLLMENT. HELLO NOT. YOU SEE THAT AND READ THERE IS SO MUCH MORE US TO ADDICT INVEST IN OUR REGION TO TRULY REACH CALIFORNIANS WITH MINISTER ECKLEY UNDERSERVED FOR GENERATIONS UC MERCED AND UC RIVERSIDE ARE ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THEY ARE ON THE CUSP OF BECOMING RESEARCH LEVEL ONE AND ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AMERICA. INSTEAD AGENTS. TIMELY TRANSFER INFORMATIONAL INVESTMENT IN UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED IS KEY TO SPURRING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY SPECIFICALLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND IN THE JOAQUIN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AB TWENTY FORTY SIX THIS STAB WISHES THE INLAND RISING FUNDS. ALLOCATING ONE POINT FOUR SIX BILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDS TO THE. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE STATE BUDGET AT UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED. THIS INVESTMENT WOULD EXPAND CAMPUS CAPACITY MORE RAPIDLY TO RESPOND TO THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF THE STATE AND LOCAL REGIONS SPECIFICALLY BY ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. CLIMATE CHANGE HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH THE INVESTMENT WILL RESULT IN THE FIRST EIGHT B. U. AND ONLY THE SECOND RESEARCH ONE INSTITUTION IN THE INLAND VALLEY REGIONS. BENEFITING UC'S MOST DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS STRATEGICALLY ADVANCING THE STATURE OF THESE TWO UNIVERSITIES WILL ACCELERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INLAND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. GIVEN RECENT ENROLLMENT ISSUES AND OTHER UC CAMPUSES SUCH AS UC BERKELEY AND THE HISTORIC LACK OF EQUITABLE INVESTMENT ACROSS CAMPUSES IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE BEGIN TO RECTIFY THESE PROBLEMS THIS IS WHY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY SIX. I REALIZE THAT RECENT AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED AND THAT THEY ARE STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION WE ARE OPEN TO HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS MOVING FORWARD HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE IS JACK CLARK.

AND THE NICE THING OF THIS INITIATIVE- VERY ATTRACTIVE AND NAME THE SUN RISING CLASS. SO CERTAINLY THAT THE ORIOLES- IN A BECOME THE AREA WITH THE SUN RISING AND THE ECONOMIC MORE VITALITY DEVELOPMENTS IS SO I THINK I AM IN SUPPORT OF THAT THE AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ANY OF CLOSING STATEMENT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF GRACE GOING TO MAKE THAT THE STATEMENT. WHAT BOTH OF YOU EITHER ONE OF YOU IS A WEBER GRILL. THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY SENATE SHOULDER SHOULDER WITH CHAIR MEDINA DEMANDING SIGNIFICANT AND MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT IN UC MERCED UC RIVERSIDE. THESE CAMPUSES REPRESENTED A PARCHER FROM OUR STATE'S TRACK RECORD OF IGNORING INLAND COMMUNITIES AND DIRECTING INVESTMENTS TOWARDS POPULATION CENTERS ON THE COAST. THERE'S A REASON THAT DESPITE BEING HOME TO FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. THERE WAS NOT A UC CAMPUS IN THE VALLEY UNTIL YOU SEE MERCED OPENED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE AFTER A TWO DECADE FIGHT. YOU SEE MERCED IS NOT RECEIVE THE SAME STATE SUPPORT AS THE OTHER UC CAMPUSES IN PART. BECAUSE OF THIS INLAND BIAS BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT OPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT RECESSION. SO ALL OTHER CAMPUSES WERE BUILT ALMOST ENTIRELY WITH STATE MONEY. MUCH OF UC MERCED WAS BUILT BE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAMPUS TAKING ON SIGNIFICANT DEBT. IN ORDER TO EXPAND AND ROLL ENOUGH STUDENTS TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT. UNIQUE UNTO ITSELF FROM OTHER CAMPUS IN THE SYSTEM BILLIONS IN ON PRESIDENT SURPLUSES WE HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING TO RIGHT THIS WRONG TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON THE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND UC MERCED. AND LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDENTS FOR A MOMENT. UC MERCED WAS BUILT WITH THE PROMISE OF BRING IT UC EDUCATIONS TO STUDENTS WHO TRADITIONALLY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE SYSTEM. UC MERCED IS THE MOST ETHNICALLY AND CULTURALLY DIVERSE CAMPUS IN THE UC SYSTEM MORE THAN 70% OF STUDENTS ARE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. YOU SEE MERCED IS ALSO ENROLLED THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS IN THE UC SYSTEM IN THE CAMPUS HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BOTH AS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION. AND IS AN ASIAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER SERVING INSTITUTION. YOU SEE MERCED IS DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF EQUAL REPRESENTATION THAT MANY OF US PREACH IN THIS BUILDING AND IN OUR DISTRICTS EVERY SINGLE DAY. BUT THEY ARE DOING THIS DESPITE BEING FORCED TO OVERCOME BIAS AND UNDER INVESTMENT FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE UC IN THE STATE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT BIAS LOOKS LIKE FOR ME. THE ALEJO'S DISCUSSION OF THE UC BUDGET THIS YEAR MENTIONS UC MERCED RIVERSIDE UC MERCED AND UC RIVERSIDE ONLY ONCE BY NOTING THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY REFERRAL CAMPUSES IN THE UC SYSTEM. MEANING THERE WERE THE REFER STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ACCEPTED TO THEIR CAMPUS OF CHORES. THE L. A- THEN SUGGESTS AS A REMEDY GIVEN THE OTHER CAMPUSES MORE MONEY TO REDUCE REFERRALS BUT MAKES NO MENTION OF THE FACT THE UC MERCED HAS THE SMALLEST BUDGET OF ANY OTHER CAMPUS OR THAT. RIVER SIDE OF THE SERVING THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENT BODIES IN THE SYSTEM. THIS IS THE DEFINITION. OF REWARDING THE HAVES WHILE IGNORING THE HAVE NOTS. BUDGET DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE IT FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ENROLLMENT IN ROLLING MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND INCREASING STUDENT OUTCOMES AND EQUITY. THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO REWARD YOU SEE FOR TAKING STEPS TO MEET THESE GOALS WHILE SUGGESTING BUDGET CUTS IF THE UC FAILS TO ACT. YOU SEE MERCED AND RIVERSIDE ARE ALREADY DELIVERING ON THESE GOALS. BUT WHERE'S THEIR EXTRA MONEY. WHERE IS THE REWARD AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORGETTING RIGHT WHAT IS WRONG IT'S SO MANY OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES. THAT'S WHAT AB TWENTY FORTY SIX IS ABOUT GIVE THESE CAMPUSES THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO DO MORE BY INCREASING ENROLLMENT OF UNDERSERVED CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. INCREASE REGION SPECIFIC RESEARCH IN AGRICULTURE CLEAN AIR WATER CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAKE MAJOR ADVANCEMENTS IN HEALTHCARE BY ADVANCING MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND RESEARCH THAT ADDRESSES BOTH REGION'S DISTINCTIVE HEALTH CHALLENGES. RIGHT NOW THE UC IS ON TRACK TO ENROLL JUST ONE SIX THE NUMBER OF NEW STUDENTS CALLED FOR IN THE BUDGET. GIVEN THE RIGHT RESOURCES UC MERCED RIVERSIDE COULDN'T ROLL FAR MORE THAN THE SIXTY TWO HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS THAT THE BUDGET CALLS FOR. AND WE WOULD NOT NEED SPECIAL SECRET LEGISLATION FAST TRACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DO. FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS I'VE HEARD ABOUT DIRECT. DIRECTING SPECIFIC FUNDED INDIVIDUAL UC CAMPUSES OUTSIDE OF THE GENERAL BUDGET ALLOCATION. THE REALITY IS THAT THE CURRENT UC CAMPUS FUNDING IS INCREDIBLY REGRESSIVE. THE OLDER RICHER AND MORE STAFFERS CABS CAMPUSES RECEIVE THE LION'S SHARE OF THE UC'S FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. STATE FUNDS BUILT THOSE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS WHICH ARE HUGELY PROFITABLE FOR THE- BUT THOSE ARE. STAY AT THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES INSTEAD OF BEING SPREAD TO LIFT ALL BOATS. STATE FUNDING ALSO MADE FEDERAL CONTRACTS COPYRIGHT RESEARCH IN SPORTS REVENUE POSSIBLE BUT AGAIN ALL THAT REVENUE STATUS AT THE RESPECTIVE. AB TWENTY FORTY SO TEXAS TOWARDS A THIS IN THAT. BY DIRECT SPECIAL INVESTMENT TOWARD TWO OF THEM UNDER CAMPUS AND YOU SEE SO. IN TWO OF THE MOST UNDER REGION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AND- JUST SAY THIS IS OUR PER OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. WE'VE LAID OUT VALUE WE WANT FOR THE UC SYSTEM HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A HISTORIC INVESTMENT AT A TIME THAT WE HAVE BILLIONS TO INVEST. AND MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE FOR THESE REGIONS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN CLOSING STATEMENT I HAVE HEARD. ALL RIGHT- SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY YET THE ORDERS JUST- WAIT UNTIL QUORUM IS MADE THAT VOTE ON THIS. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MANY IS ON THE WAY.

IN ADDITION EVEN THOUGH MANY CALIFORNIANS. WITH INTERNET ACCESS LAST INTERNET SPEEDS THAT MEET THE NEEDS HAS WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT WITH ZOOM'S EVERYTHING ELSE IS A VERY INTENSE. INTERNET REQUIREMENTS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN MEANINGFUL STEPS TO TOWARDS CLOSING THE GAP ON INTERNET ACCESSIBILITY FURTHER THESE STEPS HAVE INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN BROADBAND FOR STUDENTS.

WHICH IS MEANT TO HELP. PAY FOR BOOKS AND OTHER COLLEGE COSTS HOWEVER THE MIDDLE ROAD AND LAST MILE PROJECTS. STILL NEED TO BE COMPLETED AND EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO QUALITY BROADBAND.

FOR SEVERAL MONTHS MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE WORKED WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY CONDUCTING RESEARCH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA DREAM LOAN PROGRAM THE DREAM LOAN PROGRAM IS AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM THAT ASSISTS STUDENTS IN FINANCING THEIR EDUCATION IT IS THE ONLY STATE LOAN PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. THROUGH OUR RESEARCH WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE CURRENT PROGRAM ONLY ALLOWS FOR DISCHARGING FORBEARANCE BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME PROVISIONS THAT DON'T COMPLETE THE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAMS SUCH AS FALSE CERTIFICATION- FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SUCH AS EMERGENCY RELIEF DURING NATURAL DISASTERS. ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM GRANTED TEMPORARY FORBEARANCE DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT WASN'T CLEAR TO MANY STUDENTS WHETHER THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR FORBEARANCE OVER OR WHETHER THEY HAD TO PROVIDE PAYMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE WORRY ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES THAT OFTEN DISPLAYS AND PUT PEOPLE AND UNSTABLE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECTIONS ARE IN STATUTE FOR ANY STATE OF EMERGENCIES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE PROBE. HE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS CURRENTLY SET FORTH IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM SUCH AS THE PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS AND OTHER LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS TO THOSE PURSUING A CAREER IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. TODAY DREAMLAND BARS CONTINUE TO FACE REPAYMENT DESPITE REYES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC SERVICE ARE ENTERING A DEMANDING FIELD. THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM HAS INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE LIKE ME TO FOLLOW THE FEEL THE PUBLIC INTEREST KNOWING THAT ONE DAY I WILL ACT I WILL HAVE ACCESS TO A PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN PROGRAM. THE STATE OF KEPT THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA HAS GRANTED UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WITH LICENSES TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE. I ASK MYSELF WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND UNDOCUMENTED BORROWER THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES DESERVE ACCESS TO THESE LONG. IT THE INTENT OF PLEASURE TO CREATE INEQUITY AMONG STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS AND IT IS KNOWN THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS FACE GREATER DIFFICULTIES IN FINANCING THEIR EDUCATION.

COACH COUNSELING LIBRARIAN AN INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY WHO ARE STARTING OR EXPANDING THEIR FAMILIES THE CSE'S EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE TO DO TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR NEWBORN.

IF THIS YEAR'S USUALLY COULD. INTEREST SUCH RACISM NEVER CITY AND INCLUSION AS IT CLAIMS TO BE CSU MANAGEMENT WOULD HAVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SIGNED OFF ON THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATIONS PROPOSAL. TO EXPAND PARENTAL LEAVE AND COME CLOSER TO PROVIDING THEIR WORK LIFE BALANCE BUT IS CSU MANAGEMENT SHOWS TRAIN AND ANTIQUATED LEE POLICY THAT THIS FOR. PARTLY IMPACTS MEN AND FACULTY COLOR. THE SCREEN ALL A THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE CSU DISPARITY IN PARENTAL LEAVE CONTINUES TO SET THE U. S. APART FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. DAVICH LANE FOR COUNTRIES WITH NATIONAL PAID PARENTAL LEAVE IS TWENTY NINE WEEKS. THE CSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THIS BASIC STANDARD. ONE SIMPLE BUT SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT THANK SURE THAT WE RETAIN WOMEN OF COLOR ON FACULTY IS TO COMMIT TO A SEMESTER TO TERM PARENTAL LEAVE.

WHICH THAT BURDEN ON FAT DANNATT STRESS THAT. COULD BE SPENT ARE A- THING. BECAUSE CSU EAST I THINK PROVIDING AT PRINCE LEAVE THE CONTRA NEGOTIATIONS.

FOR LECTURERS AND A MEMBER OF OUR CFA BARGAINING. SPEAKING ON BEHALF. B. TWENTY FOUR SIXTY FOUR CFA IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR BEING ITS AUTHOR SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE ASKING WHY DO WE NEED THIS BILL MY NETWORK TO EXPAND PARENTAL LEAVE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING INSTEAD. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ADEQUATE PAID PARENTAL LEAVE SHOULD NOT JUST BE A PERK OR BENEFIT THAT COMES WITH THE NECKLACE AND THEY'RE THIS IS A PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE THIS IS AN EQUAL RIGHT IT. THE NEW FAIRNESS AND INCLUDE. WE KNOW FROM DATA ACROSS THE NATION INCLUDING HEARING. THAT AN ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR WORKING PARENTS INCLUDING A LACK OF PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. IS A DRIVING FORCE AND WOMEN LEAVING THE WORKPLACE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT INADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR PARENTS HAS A LONG TERM DISPARITY IMPACT ON WORKING MOTHERS RELATED TO THEIR PAY. PROMOTION AND XIN. MICHAEL T. IN THE SEAT WE OFTEN CALL THE QUOTE MOMMY TAX. BUT IN REALITY IT'S SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY AND IT REFLECTS THE LONG HISTORY OF SEXISM IN OUR SOCIETY THAT PENALIZES WOMEN SPECIFICALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY WHEN THEY GIVE BIRTH OR ADOPT A CHILD. THANK YOU HE'S RELATED I DON'T NINE IT IS CRITICAL AND NOT LEAVE PARENTAL LEAVE HAS SUCH WAITING PATIENCE FOR THE- INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN THE CSU. TO THE HANDS OF AN EMPLOYER WHO HAS PROVEN REPEATEDLY THAT THEY ARE NOT UP TO THE TASK. WE'RE STILL THEIR ACTIONS DEMONSTRATE A LACK OF CARE AND A LACK OF SERIOUSNESS. I CAN'T FIRST BADLY. ANCES AT THE- TABLE WITH. NOT ONLY WERE THEY DISINTERESTED IN WORKING WITH US EARNESTLY ON PARENTAL LEAVE THEY REFUSE TO DEVELOP A SINGLE COUNTER PROPOSAL ON THE ISSUE WE PROPOSE DURING BARGAINING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF. WHEN PRESSED TO JUSTIFY THE REFUSAL TO AND WITH US IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS ISSUE. THEIR CHIEF NEGOTIATOR BASICALLY SAID QUOTE WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO WORK. THE FRAME PARENTAL LEAVE LIKE THAT IS AN OUTRAGE BUT THANKFULLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER TO MODEL THE KIND OF MORAL LEADERSHIP MISSING IN THE CSU. THIS GOES TO THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A STATE AND THE VALUES WE ESPOUSE AROUND JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS. AND THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT THROUGH THIS BILL FORCE A CULTURE SHIFT IN THE CSU AND HOW IT VIEWS AND TREATS WHAT. PARENTS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE WOMEN.

YOU KNOW IN MY OTHER ROLE AS AN OBGYN AND THE ISSUE OF- PAID PARENTAL LEAVE AND HOW MUCH TIME. WILL GET A CHANCE TO OUR MOTHER EARTH CHANCE TO BOND WITH THEIR CHILD AFTER BIRTH A SOMETHING THAT I WITH. AN M. AND ON A PERSONAL SOMEONE WHO. WENT TO WORK WEEK. AFTER BOTH OF MY SECTION FROM MY- I. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT A SYSTEMIC THREAT OUR COUNTRY. AND OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T DO THIS TO THEIR TO THEIR NEWLY PARENTS SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS I ACTUALLY HAVE- QUESTIONS- TO DR WEBER. I ACTUALLY HAVE RIGHT NOW- THE STAFF MEMBER WHOSE- EXPECTING SOON AND- SHE SHE WAS ACTUALLY WITH TO. BE CONSULTED WITH MY- THE HR MANAGER ABOUT JUST THIS QUESTION RIGHT AND SO AND I WAS SPEAKING WITH MY WIFE YESTERDAY ABOUT THE VERY. AND THE WIFE TRIED. A POINTED OUT TO THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT SEEMS RIGHT THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF. THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT POLICIES. RIGHT AT THE STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE CERTAIN. A PARENTAL LEAVE. AND THEN OUR OWN EMPLOYEES- HAVE DIFFERENT RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AS SUCH STATE EMPLOYEES THEY ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND SO THEN AND I'M- PRETTY MUCH WANTED TO MAKE THIS INTO A QUESTION BECAUSE- MY TWO CHILDREN WERE IN QUITE A WHILE AGO. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I DO REMEMBER- IN- MY WIFEHAVING TIME- SO IT IS UNEVEN THEN IS I THINK THE POINT THAT I'M MAKING RIGHT IT IS UNEVEN IT IS NOT- IT'S NOT THE SAME. UP FROM ONE. THE STATE TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY IS DIFFERENT- HOW WELL HOW WELL HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT VERY SUBJECT WHY WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OF POLICIES IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAY WHY DON'T WE HAVE SOMETHING MORE EVEN. I THINK WE DON'T VALUE. PERRANCE ATHLETICALLY OFTENTIMES THAT FEMALE PARENTS SINCE THE BURDEN HAS BEEN PUT ON THEM BUT THIS IS REALLY NOW IT'S MOVED INTO TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT BOTH OF OUR PAST. IMPORTANCE OF BOTH PARENTS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOND WITH MY CHILDREN I'M SURE THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS COLLECTIVELY FOR THE WHOLE AND HAVE MADE SOME STRIDES OVER THE YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HERE BUT NOT ENOUGH- WE HAVE A NEW BILL. THAT IS BEING WORKED ON UP THERE AS WELL TO CONTINUE TO MAKE BUT I THINK IT'S FINING. RESPECT TO HONOR THESE PARENTS THE WAY THAT AND- A WE WERE JUST TALKING THE SAME OFFICE. I'VE OF. A STAFF RACK A CHILD AT LEAST EVERY YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN HERE FOR TEN YEAR AND- THIS PANDEMIC WITH EXCELLENT- IN TEAM VERY. AND BUT YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE TIME HERE- HOW MUCH THEY VALUE THAT TIME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOME AND FOR THEM IT'S DIFFERENT LEVELS AND I HAVE SUBMIT ENOUGH- THEY CAN TELEPORT TO PAY TAKE THAT ADDITIONAL ON PAID LEAVE THAT THEY- WANTED TAKEN THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE CHOICES TO COME BACK PROBABLY SOONER THAN THEIR BABY OR THEIR BODIES WALK. OUT THERE AND THAT'S STRUGGLE HOW DO WE ACCOMMODATE AND SO- I THINK WE MOVE IN INCREMENTS THAT TIME TO ALWAYS TO KEEP- OF THE BIGGER PICTURE WE HAVE THAT WORK ALSO HAPPENING AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INCREMENTS FOR A GROUP. OF PROFESSIONALS ARE WELL WE'RE ALSO DOING THAT ADDITIONAL WORK. TO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. I WANTED TO RESPOND GO AHEAD YES- MISSED. MAN ARE IT'S REALLY TO BE HERE PERSON- SOCCER. LAW NOT ONLY DISK. AGAINST WOMEN IT TAKES IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PARENTS AS THEY HAVE TO THIS PLETE ALL THEIR SICK LEAVE JUST TO BEAR CHILDREN AND GIVES BIRTH AND- I. TAKE THE TIME THAT THEY NEED TO BOND AND WHAT NOT AND THERE IS THIS. STIGMA THAT TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS- ONLY WHAT NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR YOUNG KIDS AND WE HAVE TO SCHEDULE OUR PREGNANCIES AS AS AS HE IS THAT HE'S A PROFESSOR SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS WE'RE GIVING BIRTH DURING THE MONTH OF JUNE. AS NUMBER. SO WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME DURING HER BREAK EITHER PLANNING OR ATTENDING BIRTHDAY PARTIES LOTS OF. IT IS REALLY UNFAIR THIS IS A- THIS IS ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING. HOW IT DID THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT HOME. HARJIT THAT IS PROFESSION BUT THROUGHOUT THE K. TWELVE. THE ENTIRE SCHOOL SYSTEM SCHOOL EMPLOYEES- IT'S ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING- AND THAT IS ALL. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO GO NEXT TO THE ISSUE THAT CSU RIGHT OUT OF THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A BARGAINING. ISSUE- AND THAT THE BILL AND THEN- CIRCUMVENTS THE BARGAINING- PROCESS. THE CONDUCTOR AND I. N. AND I MAY GO TO CSU WHICH ALSO. I THINK AS WE HEARD A PERFECT. BUT WE'LL START HERE THEN I'LL GO TO SEE A SHIFTING AS WE HEARD FROM OUR WITNESS. THE ATTITUDE DURING THE BARGAINING PROCESS THAT NOT- GATHER GARNER SIX F. INSPECTOR THEY CAME IN WITH AN OPEN MIND AND IT'S MY OPINION THAT WHILE WE RESPECT THAT IN THERE WITH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. I HAS. NUMBER ON THIS ISSUE THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE A DUTY TO INTERVENE TO CORRECT INJUSTICES ON THE PROCESS HAS FAILED THEM ON AND SAID TO ME CLEARLY THIS PROCESS S FAILING. GLACIER S. U. V. LIKE TO RESPOND PLEASE DO YES ON THIS IS JOHN CASE I'M GONNA HAVE MY- TECHNICAL SUPPORT- JOSEPH GILLAN SIX WHO'S THE ASSISTANT CHANCELLOR OF THE BARGAIN BONTA.

HEY YOU WILL IS A LOT BETTER- OVERALL BY. BEEN WHAT THE FEAR PROVIDE- I HIGHER YOU EMPLOYER. HAD A WAITING OF YEAR EMPLOYEES USE THE BENEFIT. AND ON TOP OF THAT THE EMPLOYEE- AT THAT INSTITUTE HAD THE AND THEN NUMBER OF OUR- WHICH PART.

WHY THEY WERE ON THE PARENTAL LEAVE AND SO THE PARTIES REACHED A COMPREHENSIVE I TEN IMMIGRANT MENTIONED NUMBER- THAT WAS RATIFIED IN FEBRUARY AND IN THE END THE UNIVERSITY.

BARGAINING ABILITIES AND SO- FACULTY MAYBE AT ONE LEVEL AND HAVE ONE TYPE OF INSURANCE STAFF HAS ANOTHER- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I SIDE UT SOUTHWESTERN UCSD IN TERMS OF WHAT PASSED BACK WHAT HE HAD. THE FEDS IN TIME OFF VERSUS WHAT THE STAFF PAD- AND VERSUS WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES HAD AND SO I WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU WERE WHEN I WAS COUNSELING PATIENTS ON WHAT KIND OF- MATERNITY LEAVE OR HOW MUCH TIME THEY WOULD HAVE OFF.

WITH IT SO I. THOUGHT I RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR AYE WILL AND STEP OUT TO CORRECT SOME OF THAT MOMMY TEXAS WON'T FIX OUR PROBLEMS BUT A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THANK YOU MISTER. FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. I GAVE NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BILL. AND I SAID THAT I WOULD LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION. AND THERE IS NO RECOMMENDATION. BUT- WE SHARED ALL THE DISCUSSION AND EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR WEBER HAD TO ADD- IT IS NOT VERY OFTEN THAT I WANT TO INTERJECT. MYSELF FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BARGAINING PROCESS WE DID ONE BEFORE- OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES AT CSU. SO EVEN I DON'T RECOMMEND IN ON THIS BILL.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IN MEMBERS I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT CLASSIFIED POSITIONS HIRING FLEXIBILITY ACT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ELEAZAR HAVE USED TO RULE OUT THREE RANKS TO HIRE CANDIDATES BASED ON THE PLAN. EXAM CORE FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A FAKE QUIT A CREDENTIAL SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND CUSTODIAL STAFF BUS DRIVERS AND CAFETERIA STAFF TO RULE THREE RANKS ROUNDS EACH CANDIDATE SCORE FROM THE EXAMINATION PROCESS TO THE NEAREST PERCENTAGE POINT. AND THEN RANKS THOSE SCORES BY ONE PERCENTAGE THIS MEANS ONLY THE TOP THREE SCORES ELIGIBLE FOR POTENTIAL EMPLOYMENT LIMITING THE POOL OF APPLICANTS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. THE CURRENT SYSTEM FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND BEGIN WHO MAY BE BETTER SUITED OVERALL FOR PARTICULAR JOB BECOME FROM A SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND THAT HAS LED THEM TO LESS. ADEPT AT STANDARDIZED TESTS AS A RESULT. LOCKED THEM OUT OF FROM A DESERVED JOB OPPORTUNITY WHILE INTENDED TO PREVENT NEPOTISM OR BIAS IN HIRING WILL RULE OF THE RANKS HAD ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGES. THE 1% DISTINCTION BETWEEN BRANCHES SO NOW THAT IT LIMITS THE ABILITY FOR HIRING KICK COMMITTEES HIRING OUT TO CONSIDER WELL QUALIFIED AND IT'S- WHO MAY EXCEL IN OTHER JOB RELATED. SINCE. SURE BUT DO PLAN WITHIN THE THREE RANKS AS SUCH AB TWO FORTY WILL DELEGATES TO OPT INTO A BANDING SYSTEM. THAT WOULD INSTEAD GROUP CANADA'S BY NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR HIRING TO FIVE CANDIDATES. WHEN TRANSITIONING FROM THE RULE OF THREE TWO BANDING A PERSONNEL COMMISSION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER TO CHANGE TO BANDING SYSTEM IS SUITABLE FOR THEIR LEN. UPON DETERMINATION BY THE COMMISSION THE PROPOSED CHANGES WILL BE BROUGHT UP FOR NEARLY A EMPLOYEE MAJORITY VOTE.

ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CHOI. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF MCCARTHY I THINK I UNDERSTAND DO YOUR INTENT THIS UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AIR QUALITY IN SCHOOL LAST I'M SO. BUT THAT THERE IS A AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION RAISING THE QUESTION WHICH I AM ALSO CONCERNED- THAT IS- WHAT YOU'RE A RECENT THINGS- ARE FOR MAKING PRIVATE THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY. SCHOOL BOARDS TO SUBJECT TO A COMPLIANCE SO WITH THIS IS A PROVISIONS- NO MATTER HOW GREAT YES C. A. CALL. BUT IF PLEASE EXACTING PROFIT THE IS. SO OFTEN HEIAU EDUCATION. RIGHT THE DECISION YEAH EXISTENCE. YES THANK YOU WE- WELL YOUR OVERALL QUESTION I THINK IS RELATED TO ALL PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THE EXCEPT READ OUR UNIVERSITY COLLEGES- IN THAT LAST TWO. THIS ARGUMENT WELL WELL THERE QUALITY IN THAT WORST DAY IN THE WORLD TWO YEARS AGO JUST AS BAD FOR YOU KNOW THEY MICHAEL WAS IT WAS TO NOT GO CROSS. OTHER SCHOOL IN THE SAME BLOCK. CAN WE DO IT ALL WELFARE RELAY TO OUR SCHOOL SO I THOUGHT THAT IT WASN'T APPROPRIATE TO TWO DIFFERENT SHAPE HOWEVER I THINK FOR THE OF THIS YEAR CITY THAT THE DRUG ISSUE FOR MANY. WHERE A DRESSING THAT RELATE TO. BECAUSE OF THE CIVIC CENTER HERE. IF I JUST MIGHT ADD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CURRENTLY TITLE EIGHT THAT HAS CURRENTLY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING VENTILATION SYSTEMS AN H. BACK AND HOW OFTEN THEY NEED TO BE INSPECTED. APPLIES TO ALL. SCHOOLS BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SILVERY WERE INCREASING THE STANDARD IT JUST IT JUST MADE SENSE TO CONTINUE AND APPLY THAT STANDARD AS IT DOES TO. TO ALL SCHOOLS. AND MY SECOND QUESTION IS- YOU WILL BE A LOT HOW ARE YOUR STANDARD DAHLE. A DIFFERENCE WILL BE UP BETWEEN TO MY TO MY UNDERSTANDING. LOCAL. AUTHORITY SELECTED CITIES AND COUNTIES THEY DO HAVE- BUILDING- SPECS AND- REQUIREMENTS. AND JUST LIKE THE MAINTAINING ELEVATORS. AND SO- YOUR BILL IS- TRYING TO MAKE UP A SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THE COVER THE BY NOT LOCAL LAW. AUTHORITIES STANDARDS TITLE LATE IS A STATE WIDE STANDARD IT'S THE LOCALS DON'T HAVE SEPARATE STANDARDS REGARDING THE- TITLE EIGHT. THE PROBLEM WITH LATE IN REFERENCE TO VENTILATION STANDARDS IS IT A RIG IT REQUIRES THEM TO BE INSPECTED. DO YOU FEAR WITH THOSE ONCE THE YEAR INSPECTIONS BUT FOLLOW WHAT IS THE NATIONAL STANDARD THE ASHTRAY DANDER. IT THAT AT LEAST ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS YOU NEED A MORE IN DEPTH INSPECTION. THAT IS MORE DETAILED- AND DID THAT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE LIVE IN THE AIR OF COVE IT AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN TITLE. IT IS CURRENT FORM WAS ADOPTED IT WAS EASY YOU KNOW YEARS BEFORE WE HAD A COVERT PANDEMIC. SO THIS BILL APPOINTED BY ITSELF WHAT THOUGHT MORE. OF ONE THE INSPECTION ORDER FOR IN NUMBERS TECHNICAL EXPERT WHO CAN DESCRIBE BUT THE ASH THE NATIONAL ASH'ARI STANDARDS FOR A FIVE YEAR INSPECTION WHICH IS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION DELINEATES PRESCRIPTIVE. EXACTLY WHAT YOU LOOKED AT HOW IT USED TO BE TESTED AND WHAT THE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS ARE. IN PLACE TO STE. IF AFFECTED IS. GO OFF OF THAT. YOU KNOW THE- CODES THAT APPLIES TO YOU KNOW NEW CONSTRUCTION AND- H. FAQ INSTALLATION AND ACTIVATION RATES IS TOTAL TWENTY FOUR THE TOTAL TWENTY FOUR ONLY APPLIES WHEN YOU TO NEW CONSTRUCTION THEY DO MAJOR MODIFICATION ALTERATIONS DOESN'T APPLY TO EXISTING CLASS. INTO REHAB. THE WORD PROP. REALLY IT'S TAKEN LOT OF THE TITLE TWENTY FOUR REQUIREMENTS BUT SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE REQUIREMENT HAS FOR V. FIVE YEARS REQUIRES YOU TO DO SOME OTHER PREVENT ACCEPTANCE TESTING ARE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU DO NEW CONSTRUCTION TO MAKE TODAY TECHSYSTEMS WORK. WHEN IS THIS IS NOW ARE YOU FIVE YEARS YOU'RE GONNA REDO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW SOME YOU KNOW WITHIN THREE YEARS MOST OF THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING CORRECTLY AND OUR ARMED PROFICIENTLY AND PROVIDING EVERYTHING ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY DO IT RIGHT THEY COULD DO THIS EVERY YEAR IF THEY WANT. SPECS BUT WHERE. TO THE SCHOOLS OF THE CURRENTLY IS- YOU KNOW THE BETTER THING WOULD BE FOR THEM TO DO IT EVERY YEAR BUT WE JUST REQUIREMENTS EVERY FIVE YEARS. OKAY YOU'RE A GENERAL ANSWER- DESCRIBE SOME MORE GENERAL OR A- QUALITY- IS INSPECTION READY- THE H. BACK. BUT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A MCCARTY- DECLINE EXAMPLE OF LIKE DURING THE WILDFIRE- PERIOD DOES THAT THE REGION LACK OF SACRAMENTO HAD THE- WHAT DID YOU DESCRIBE IS THE WORST- EQUALITY IN THE WORLD TO DURING THAT PERIOD. WHEN I WANT MY AGE FACT THAT ACTUALLY CAN ELIMINATE THAT THAT CAN THAT KIND OF BOOK A SMALL- INFILTRATION- AND THE QUALITY OF THAT THE WE ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN EVERYTHING IS SO IMPACTED THAT DOES SO REALLY AIRCONDITIONING SCREEN NOT THAT OF A SMALL. YES SIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF PRINCES WHEN THE CARBON MONOXIDE INDICATOR IN THE CLASSROOM OR IN ANY BUILDING. INDICATES AN UNSAFE LEVEL OF WITH WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION OF CO TWO. AT THAT POINT A TRAINED TECHNICIAN CAN COME IN AND IT JUST THE VENTILATION SYSTEM REPLACE FILTERS TAKE SEVERAL DIFFERENT- ACTIONS TO ADJUST THE SYSTEM THE AIRFLOW SO THAT THEY CAN THEN MITIGATE- THAT HIGH LEVEL OF CARBON MONOXIDE THAT'S THAT'S- WHAT THIS. IF YOU HAVE. AND MANAGED SYSTEM JUST LIKE IN THIS BUILDING. AND REQUIREMENTS PROVIDE FOR THAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT IN THE HIGHEST FILTRATION THAT'S POSSIBLE THAT SYSTEM CAN HANDLE MARC THIRTEEN AND THAT PROSTRATION IS WHAT PROTECTS YOU FROM NOW THE SMOKE OUTSIDE HERE OR FINING AND THEY GO BACK IN SOME OF THE SCHOOLS. THE FILTERS AND EVEN THEIR- ANNOUNCER THIS AND MAKING SURE YOUR TEST AT. CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE THAT SO WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN YOU READY FOR. SO THIS KIND OF UPGRADED- IS SYSTEM FOR THE WELFARE OF OUR STUDENTS- BECAUSE TO THIS OUR ADDRESS TO FOUR SCHOOLS SO. IF WITH THIS PAST IS SO ORDERED THAT THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE ALL THE EVEN- A RESIDENTIAL HOMES AS WELL ALREADY REQUIRED ALREADY EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES FOR APARTMENT COMPLEXES OR EIGHT. THE AS A LOT. TO STALL A CO TWO MONITORS BUT YET WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT OF OUR CLASSROOMS TO PROTECT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR STUDENTS. THAT'S A SOUL MORE OF A- THE PUBLIC- LOOKED APARTMENTS SAID THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO BE I THAT I HAVE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME RENTAL THAT WE'RE GETTING READY TO RENTS RIGHT NOW AND TONIGHT I'M GONNA BE THERE IT'S- INSTALLING CO TWO MONITORS BECAUSE IT REQUIRED UNDER CALIFORNIA I IDEOLOGY IT ALONE- SEO TOOL MONEY THERESA REQUIRED. FOR EVERY OUT WHEN THE SO EVEN EVEN ARGUMENT. SET. BUT NOW- NORTH IS SO GOOD AND ADD THE- IN ORDER. TO ROUTE TO MUCH ENEL. INVASION INTO. IN ALL PRIVATE LIFE IT'S AN ALL I'LL IF WHAT YOU ADVOCATE. THEN I WOULD TAKE CARE OF MYSELF ABOUT DAYS OF PIED LAW REQUIRING AND- IF NOT THEN THE WHAT KIND OF PENALTY ARE YOU ASSESSING. MISS MCCARTY YEAH- ITHINK THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT OUR PUBLIC GOOD THIS IS ART IS THERE ARE THERE'S OUR ASSETS ARE PUBLIC BUILDINGS BUT ALSO THEIR ACT OUR ASSETS ARE YOU OUR KIDS IN OUR CLASSROOMS ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS WE WANT THEM TO BE HEALTHY. AND SUCCEED. BUT WE WANT TO KNOW IN OUR CLASSROOMS IF THERE'S FAULTY EQUIPMENT AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD FIX ITBECAUSE THAT THE LONGER YOU WAIT AS YOU KNOW- DID HE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME IN OUR COMMITTEE WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. LONG YOU WAIT THE MORE COST TO FIX IT SO THIS DOESN'T MANDATE YOU GO UP BY ALL INTO EQUIPMENT H. UP. LAST ROOMS ON CAMPUS WE HAVE DEFIED THE NEED X. Y. D. C. YOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND BY DOING SO HOPEFULLY YOU WOULD DO THAT. AND YOU WOULD IMPROVE. THE HEALTH DECISIONS FOR YOUR STUDENTS AND THEN LASTLY. WE'RE PUTTING MONEY LEFT AND RIGHT. FOR INSTINCTIVE TO RETROFIT- ARE HSE QUIT MANY CLASSROOMS ONE BECAUSE- WE HAVE ONE TIME MONEY WE HAD A BUNCH OF MONEY IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING THIS IT WAS A POOR FOR KOBE. AND TO. STOP AND LOWER ENERGY BILLS SO THE NEED MORE YOU DO THIS THE LOWER YOUR ENERGY COSTS WHICH ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ON THE STATEWIDE LEVEL RELATE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL SO. THERE'S MULTIPLE BENEFITS HERE. YEAH MY AMONG MANY. MY LAST QUESTION I'M GONNA ASK IS THAT PUBLIC. SCHOOL REDUCE OUR PUBLIC THE- OUR FUNDS SO WE SUPPORT THEM SO ANYTHING INFECTIOUS OF REPLACEMENT UP WHILE HIS FAXES STEM CELL HOW. WILL YOU- BE WILLING TO WHAT DOES YOUR BILL HAVE ANY PLANS TO- PROVIDE AID THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AS WELL. WHAT WHAT JUST JUST YOU THAT WE ARE CLARIFYING TECHNICAL FIX FOR COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES PRIVATE SCHOOL WILL NOT BE IN THIS BILL. BUT FOR THE PRIVATE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT THIS COMMITTEES OF EDUCATION MAY TWO WEEKS AGO. THAT WAS A PROTEST WE WANT THEM AND WE SAID NO BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT THE HEALTH OF THOSE KIDS ARE PARAMOUNT REGARDLESS OF. SCHOOL THERE CAN BE LITTLE SAME BLOCK ACROSS THE STREET AND WHAT IT IS YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON THE TOTALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT FOR ASKING. REPAIR THAT'S THAT'S NOT IN THIS BILL TODAY- FACTORS MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION IS THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE UPGRADES OF SYSTEMS IT IS AN INSPECTION REQUIREMENT AND A CO TWO MONITORING REQUIREMENT- IT'S THIRTY REQUIRED ACTIVE HERE TO DO THE GOOD JOB THEY WILL. IN FACT WHICH MAY. FIVE YOU REALLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM LETS MISSING BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERETHAT MANDATES ANY UPGRADES ARE IT SAYS TO. BETTER PEOPLE KNOW WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOUR CLASSROOM DOESN'T HAVE EFFECTIVELY TO WHETHER TEACHER. ARE YOU A STUDENT.
