THEY HAVE AN ACCIDENT THERE

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.565
WOULD HAVE -- TO NOTIFY TO THE

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.266
FAA WAS OUR UNDERSTAND

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:23.535
ACCIDENTALLY BUT I HAD THOUGHT

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.836
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON ONE OF

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:26.371
SEVEN I'M AN EXPERT ON NINETY

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.572
ONE AND ONE THIRTY FIVE AND I

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:28.773
WANT -- TO SEVEN I HAD THOUGHT

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.874
THAT BECAUSE OF JUST READING

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.176
FROM ONE OH SEVEN DOT TWELVE IT

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:31.576
SAYS.

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:32.610
NO PERSON MAY MANIPULATE THE

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:33.578
FLIGHT CONTROLS OF A SMALL.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:35.880
UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM UNLESS

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:36.481
AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE THING

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.416
OF OF OF CATEGORIES SO I THOUGHT

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:39.617
THAT EVEN RECREATIONAL.

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:41.086
DRONE OPERATORS HAD TO COMPLY

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.654
WITH ONE OF SEVEN BECAUSE ONE OF

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.321
SEVEN IS WHERE IT SAYS YOU HAVE

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.989
TO REGISTER GROWN YOU HAVE TO

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.491
GET A DRONE OPERATOR'S LICENSE.

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:47.792
AND SO THAT LEFT ME WONDERING

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.160
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE EXEMPTING ALL

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.062
OF ONE OF SEVEN PEOPLE OPERATING

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:57.368
UNDER WATER SEVEN WHO.

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:59.070
WHO'S LEFT.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:28:59.971
SO AGAINST MY UNDERSTANDING THAT --

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.106
MOST COMMERCIAL OPERATORS ARE

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:01.773
PART ONE OF SEVEN AND THEN SOME

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.674
RECREATIONAL CAN CHOOSE TO GO

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.541
THROUGH THE FULL PART ONE OF

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.809
SEVEN PROCESS BUT WHAT WE'RE

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:05.910
TRYING TO CAPTURE THOSE

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.745
RECREATIONAL OPERATORS WHO

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:08.413
AREN'T.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.747
PART WHEN A SEVEN TO PROBABLY

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:10.682
THE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THE

00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:13.318
DAMAGE AT THE TEMPLE HER JUST

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:16.020
OKAY WELL WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:17.856
JUDICIARY ACTS AS A RIGHT.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.657
AFTER THIS.

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:20.859
WITH THIS BILL.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.161
IT'S GOING TO TRANSPORTATION.

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:23.795
FLOOR BUT ALTHOUGH DELIVER MORE

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:24.963
RESEARCH ON THAT IF I COULD

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.931
OFFER ONE SUGGESTION -- IT WOULD

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.734
BE THAT YOU DEFINE DAMAGE A

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.370
LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY SO

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:33.972
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO TO FILE

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:34.806
REPORTER OR LEADER

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:36.574
IDENTIFICATION IF YOU'RE GROWN

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:37.342
CAUSES DAMAGE.

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:38.776
BUT TO TO JUST USE A RIDICULOUS

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:41.146
EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE FLYING A DRONE

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:43.214
AND YOU RUN OUT OF BATTERY AND

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.315
IT COMES DOWN IN SOMEONE'S YARD

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:46.551
INTO BANDS A SINGLE BLADE OF

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.685
GRASS I MEAN I'M I'M I'M BEING

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:49.687
RIDICULOUS HERE BUT I MEAN THAT

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:50.855
IS MATERIALLY DAMAGE RIGHT.

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:51.489
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:54.492
THINK THAT WERE INTENDING -- TO

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.560
SAY THAT THAT'S AN ACCIDENT A

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:57.228
REQUIRE YOU TO LEAVE NOTICE FOR

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.230
SO -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU

ADOPT THE SAME TEST THAT IF WE

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:02.901

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:06.905
YOU KNOW ABOVE WHICH THAT'S

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.574
CONSIDERED DAMAGE AND BELOW

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.644

OF THE YEAR.

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:47.223

HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY IT BY

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:09.459
SCOOPING CALLS AND JUST THE THE

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:10.059
PAIN.

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:12.162
THAT THE IN THE IN THE BEHIND

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:13.763
THEY CREATE -- COULD YOU SPEAK

TO A LITTLE I I ALSO HAVE SOME

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:16.733
CONCERNS ABOUT THE CPC AND THEIR

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.501
ROLE IN THE BILL KEY TO SPEAK A

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:21.938
LITTLE BIT -- TO YOU KNOW WHY IS

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.606
IT NECESSARY TO HAVE A BE BOTH

AG AND THE CBC -- OR IS THERE

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:28.478
SOME ROOM THERE TO MAN MOVEMENT

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:29.512
ON THAT ISSUE AND IT THEY THEY

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:31.915
MENTION THAT THE BILL IS VERY

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:33.349
GENERAL AND THAT EFFORT AND

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:37.353
ACTUALLY THIS IS A VERY

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.188
EXTREMELY NARROW BILL.

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.589
THE BILL SIMPLY REQUIRESTHEM TO

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:40.356
IMPLEMENT.

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:42.325
A AUTHENTICATION PROGRAM

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:42.625
[inaudible]

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:46.162
AND THE NEXT THING.

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.798
WE HAVE TO ENFORCE THE LAW SO

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.600
HOW WOULD WE ACTUALLY ENFORCE

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.101
THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:53.403
AND IMPLEMENTING.

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.438
THIS TECHNOLOGY WHO WOULD

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.673
OVERSEE THAT WHO WOULD.

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.875
ARE A CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.544
NUMBER TWO WE WANT TO GO AFTER

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:03.680
THE THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:04.647
SCAMMING.

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.583
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO TRACK DOWN

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.218
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE IF THERE

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.686
FOR SOME REASON.

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.221
LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:14.991
GENERAL'S OFFICE -- FINDS THAT --

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.826
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:18.027
THERE'S ALSO GOT TO BE A

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.363
MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THAT PART

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.932
OF IT SO THE PCS OF EXTREMELY

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.734
LIMITED ROLE.

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.202
I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:29.873
ABOUT THE UC USING THIS BILL TO

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:32.242
PRY OPEN OTHER -- YOU KNOW OTHER

00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:34.410
REGULATORY ACTION THAT WOULD NOT

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:37.747
BE -- ALLOWED UNDER THIS BILL.

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:38.681
IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:42.018
ACTION AS DEFINED BY THE BILL --

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:42.952
I'M.

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.388
COMFORTABLE WITH WORKING WITH

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:46.055

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:48.291
OR SUBMIT A LETTER TO THE

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.993
JOURNAL AND TO THAT REGARD.

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:54.664
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED --

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.431
TO CONFIRM THAT THE

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:57.233
TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.034
DOING THIS AND THAT COULD COULD

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.969
BE THE P. UC'S ROLE AND ALSO TO

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:01.537
WORK WITH YOU TENER TOURNEY

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:03.106
GENERAL TO COMPILE DATA.

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:05.942
GETTING GET DATA TOGETHER DOES

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:07.911
NOT -- AND AND IT WOULD BE

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:10.713
SPECIFIC TO LOOK IN FOR THE

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.448
SCAMMERS AND IT WOULD BE

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:15.151
SPECIFIC -- TO WORKING WITH THE

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:17.921
ATTORNEY GENERAL BEING PEOPLE --

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:19.856

I DON'T SEE FOR WE LIVE I'VE

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.626
DISCUSSED THIS WITH THEM AT

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.071
I DON'T WANNA RAISE -- ANY

00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:37.206
MISTER PROBLEMS FOR THEM BUT

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:39.275
WERE REALLY NARROWLY FOCUSED ON

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:40.643
ENSURING THAT.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.911
THE PC DOES ITS JOB NOT SURE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:43.746
THEY'RE DOING THAT AND WE GO AND

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.281

THIS IS ME IS WHAT MAY BE

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:59.562
REQUIRED IN THIS PROCESS.

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.531
SO AS I READ IT THE FEDERAL RT

IT'S NOT JUST THE AG UNDER.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:07.236

DEFINE VERY VERY CLEARLY WHAT

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:36.366
THE CPUC ROLE WITHIN IN THIS

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.034
REGARD IT'S A VERY NARROW.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.535
IT ONLY HAS TO DO WITH --

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.471
COMPILING DATA TO WORK WITH THE

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.805

WITH THE STATE LAW IT'S VERY

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.743
NARROW.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:47.443
YEAH I MEAN IT SAYS THAT

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.982
DESIGNATED THIS AGENCY.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.051
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SI PC IN THIS

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:56.486

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:57.420
I JUST YOU.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.021

AND I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES

01:00:58.955 --> 01:00:59.922
CONCERNED I THINK THE CPC HAS

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:01.524
SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT JOBS TO DO

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:05.061
RIGHT NOW -- BUT BUT WITH REGARD

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:09.065
TO VOICE -- WHAT VOICE OVER

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.333
INTERNET?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.100
THE THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:15.738
POLICY ON ARE THE PC WAS TO GIVE

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.239

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.913
AND AND SO THE NEW RULE IS

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.014
LEGISLATURE'S THAT SETS THE

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.616
POLICY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.418
TO DO AN ATTEMPT TO SET THE

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.019
