WORK YOU'VE DONE ON INSURANCE.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.674
THE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ABLE

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.709
TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.844
THEIR ITEMIZED OF THEIR CONTENTS

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.813
WITHOUT HAPPENED ITEMIZED.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.080
WAS HUGE.

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.648
.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.083
I KNOW THAT FOR MANY FRIENDS

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.951
AFTER THEY LOST THEIR HOMES THEY

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.653
WERE.

YOU LOST YOUR HOME YOU'RE LIVING

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.026
IN A HOUSE.

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:03.228
WHERE EVERY MOVEMENT TAKES

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.664
THOUGHT WERE LIKE?

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.232
WHERE WHY HOW DO WE GET TO THE

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.068
KITCHENWHERE DID I PUT WEARS

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.369
EVERYTHING PUT IT HITCHED CRISIS

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.071
MENTAL FATIGUE AND IN ADDITION

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.605
TO THAT? THEY WERE HAVING TO GO

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.674
THROUGH ITEMIZING EVERYTHING

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.409
THEY HAD LOST WHICH IS.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.511
WHICH WAS TOP AND SO. JUST WANT

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.213

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.218
ESSENTIALLY.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.286
LEARNING FROM WHAT WE WENT

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.254
THROUGH IN CINEMA AND AND FIXING

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:30.689
THAT THE REGARD TO THAT MAY NOT

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.057
SEEM LIKE.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.559
A LITTLE THING BUT IT WAS REALLY

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.794
HUGE TWO A LOT OF THE THE PEOPLE

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.429
I TALKED WITH JUST TO HAVE THAT

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:38.997
MENTAL SPACE AND IT. REALLY

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:40.966
HELPED THEM USE THAT ENERGY FOR

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:43.068
ELSEWHERE.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.570
THERE WAS THE AND I'M SURE IF

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:46.205
YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT THE

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.107
CONCERNS ABOUT. PIC FOLKS BEING

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.541
PIT PROPERTY OWNERS BEING UNDER

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.643
INSURED THAT IS A VERY REAL

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.413
ISSUE WE HAD ONE OF OUR A WATER

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.182
AGENTS COLLEAGUES. ACTUALLY.

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:58.217
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE THEY

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.419
HAD.

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:00.953
GOTTEN THEIR DOCUMENTS AND

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:02.187
THEY'VE.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.522
SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED INCREASE

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.457
OUR FIRE INSURANCE.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.092
AND THERE'S POINTED THOUSAND

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.394
DOLLARS.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.429
UNDER FUNDED.

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.731
A MUCH OF THE THE ISSUE I THINK

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.400
WE'RE SEEING IS THE FACT THAT

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:16.435
MANY OF THESE A POLICIES.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:18.036
THEY ARE PERFECTLY REASONABLE IF

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:20.906
YOU. IF ONE HOUSE BURNS.

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:21.807
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.610
COMMUNITY BURN AND THE THE COST

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:25.844
OF CONSTRUCTION GOES UP FIFTY

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.746
PERCENT. THAT NO LONGER WORKS

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.548
AND THAT'S A THAT'S A I THINK

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:30.816
YOU'VE HEARD OTHERS BUT THAT'S A.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.317
VERY REAL CHALLENGE TO THEM.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.852
THE.

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.954
THE OTHER.

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.656
THAT WE'VE HEARD WITH REGARD TO

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.725
THE BEAT REBUILDING PROCESS AT.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:40.325
THE POINT THEY ARE IN THEIR

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.861
JOURNEY IS IS FINDING A

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:44.863
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SURVEYING

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.231
GEOTECHNICAL STRUCTURAL

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:48.233
ENGINEERS ARCHITECTS.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.435
YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY WASN'T

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.036
READY THAT.

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.071
FOUR FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOUSES

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:55.240
TO GO AND FOR THE SERVICES.

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.975
DOT SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:58.944
CHALLENGE TO BUT THEIR THEY'RE

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.179
WORKING THROUGH THEIR WAY

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.580
THROUGH THOSE AND JUST WANTED TO

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:02.915
PASS ON THOSE.

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:05.284
A WITH REGARD TO THE CINEMA

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.387
COUNTY WATER AGENCY WE HAVE BEEN.

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:10.489
WORKING WITH MANY DIFFERENT

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:12.991
COMMUNITIES ON. ON ENCOURAGING

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:14.460
AND FINDING WAYS TO ALLOW THEM

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.961
TO REBUILD. BETTER THAN THEY

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:17.529
WERE BEFORE.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:20.432
SO IN ONE AREAS AND ACTUALLY GO

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:21.967
THROUGHOUT ALL THE AREAS WERE

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:23.368
ENCOURAGING.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.537
SYSTEMS THAT WILL INCREASE

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.739
FLOOD RESILIENCY LA DROUGHT

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.842
RESILIENCY.

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.077
AND AND AND FIRE RESILIENCY AS

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.145
WELL ENERGY.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.747
LESS ENERGY SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.883
TOWARD DEVELOPING LANDSCAPE

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.618
PLANS FOR DROUGHT TOLERANT

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.153
LANDSCAPES ROLE THE AREAS THAT

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.721
HAVE TO BE REBUILT. BUT IN

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.223
ADDITION TO THAT ALSO GRADING

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.492
PLANS FOR STORM WATER CAPTURE SO

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.527
THAT HOUSE WATER RUNS OFF OF

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.229
THESE PROPERTIES THEY DON'T JUST

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:51.797
RUN OFF INTO THE STREET AND.

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:53.232
INTO A FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.266
THEY STAY ON THE PROPERTY AND

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.502
THEY INFILTRATE RECHARGE THE

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:57.903
GROUNDWATER TRYING TO RECONNECT.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.905
THE THE THE WATERSHED.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:00.772
THAT THAT'S BEEN DISCONNECTED IN

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.307
THE PAST.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.810
ONE OF THE MORE.

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.278
SOMEWHAT INNOVATIVE AREAS WE'VE

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.713
WORKED ON THIS ONE COMMUNITY

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:08.514
THAT IS REALLY A IT'S AN URBAN

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.015
FISTS.

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:10.782
COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE ALL ON

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.651
SEPT EX.

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:14.686
AND MANY OF THEM WANTED TO BE

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.054
ABLE TO CONNECT.

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:16.889
AND I'M NOT.

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.891
TOM.

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.526
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.160

REALLY DON'T AND YOU KNOW THAT.

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.764
BUT JAMES HAS BEEN ONE THAT IS

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.033
REALLY ENCOURAGED US TO BE BOLD

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.668
TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND HOW

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.803
WE COULD. HELP COMMUNITIES

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.305
REBUILD AND SO.

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:36.408
WE'VE WE FOUND A WAY TO.

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.709
WHAT THAT THAT THE WATER AGENCY

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:39.177
WE'VE HAD SOME FUNDING TO WHERE

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.213
WE CAN ACTUALLY DISH? INSTALLED

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.414
A NEW SEWER SYSTEM IN ONE OF

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.082
THESE AND ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES.

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:46.118
THAT NEEDS IT AND DEVELOPED A

00:19:46.184 --> 00:19:53.926
FINANCING PROGRAM THAT BY WHICH.

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:55.527
ESSENTIALLY THE PROPER MANNERS.

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:57.930
JOHN THAT. AND THEN AFTERTEN

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.431
YEARS THEY WOULD START UP BUT A

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.667
TWENTY YEAR LOW INTEREST LOAN

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:04.570
THE IDEA BEING THAT. A LOT OF

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.505
WITH EVERYTHING ALL DIESE FIRE

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.106
SURVIVORS ARE DEALING WITH. WE

WANTED THAT KIND OF LET THAT

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.676
WAVE OF REBUILDING AND

EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES WITH

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.278
THAT PASS.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:14.546
SO THEY CAN GET THE SYSTEMS AND

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:15.647
AND THEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:16.848
THINGS HAVE SETTLED DOWN THEY

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:18.216
WOULD BE READY BUT.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:50.081
SOME FLOOD IT'S NOT A MUD SLIDE.

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.616
IT'S NOT IN OUR VERNACULAR. AND

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:52.850
SO JUST QUICKLY WANT TO JUST

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:53.718
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:54.686
DEBRIS FLOW BECAUSE THE DEBRIS

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.588
FLOW AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE AND

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:57.589
I DON'T KNOW WHAT COUNTY OTHER

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.257
PLACES YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.091
MUDSLIDES AND DEBRIS FLOWS AND I

WANT TO. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:02.894
THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.295
HUGE IMPACT ON HOW WE'RE

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.129
RECOVERING.

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:07.565
SO OUR DEBRIS FLOW HAPPENED ON

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:08.733
JANUARY NINTH AND WE'VE BEEN

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.734
CALLING IT A GENUINE NIGHT

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.336
DEBRIS FLOW WE HAD OVER FIVE

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.570
HUNDRED STRUCTURES DESTROYED AND

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.038
DAMAGE WAS DONE OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:15.673
RED TAG. THEIR TWENTY THREE

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.075
PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST ARE

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.309
STILL MISSING.

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:19.510
WHEN I ONE WHICH IS OUR

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:21.479
LIFEBLOOD CONNECTED TO THE REST

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:22.914
OF THE WORLD WAS CLOSED FOR

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:23.881
ALMOST TWO WEEKS WE'VE HAD

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:25.650
BRIDGES. DESTROYED PEOPLE STILL

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.651
CAN'T RIVERS AND WE HAD

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:27.785
UTILITIES OUT.

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.221
SO WHAT CAUSATIVE REFLOW FIRST

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:33.591
OF ALL IT HAD THREE THINGS FIRE.

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:34.325
STEEPNESS OF THE MOUNTAINS

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.195
BEHIND US AND AN INTENSE RAIN.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.696
AND WHAT A DEBRIS FLOW WAS YOU

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:39.998
CAN SEE BY LOOKING AT THESE

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.899
PICTURES OOPS.

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.801
IS THAT IT WAS A WHOLE TORRENT

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.637
OF BOULDERS OF MUD.

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.739
TREES OF ROCKS AT JUST GUSHED

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.742
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. VERY QUICKLY.

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:52.644
UP ABOVE THE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.879
LAND ABOVE US IT OVERTOPPED

00:31:54.946 --> 00:31:56.014
ELEVEN OF OUR DEBRIS BASINS OF

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.482
THESE DEBRIS BASINS ABOUT THE

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.250
SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELDS.

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:00.785
CONTINUE TO FILL OUR STREAMS AND

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:02.353
CHANNELS EXPLODED INTO THE

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.855
NEIGHBOR NEIGHBORHOODS A CARRIED

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:06.257
WITH IT SUV'S HOUSES.

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:07.325
HUNDRED YEAR OLD TREES

00:32:07.392 --> 00:32:09.127
BRIDGES.

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:11.996
UTILITY POLES THAT WERE BOBBING

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:13.731
UP AND DOWN IN THE DEBRIS FLOW.

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:15.533
AND SO.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.201
IT CAME TOGETHER.

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:18.369
LIKE I SAID BECAUSE OF THE

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.704
STEEPNESS OF THE FORCE MOUNTAINS

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.606
THIS INTENSE RAIN AND THE HOT

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.207
THE HEAT OF THE FIRE.

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.810
SORT CHALLENGES THAT AS WE ARE

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.712
RECOVERING FROM THE DISASTER.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.514
WE ARE STILL IN TO DISASTER

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.815
BECAUSE THE MOUNDS ABOVE US ARE

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.116
NOT GOING TO RE VEGETATE FOR

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.918
ANOTHER THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:34.585
AND THE SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLD US

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.688
WE ARE STILL AT RISK.

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.356
SO I'M LIKE A FIRE WHERE THERE'S

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:39.657
A THREAT WE RECOVER IN SANTA

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:40.858
BARBARA COUNTY HAS HAD TONS OF

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.127
FIRES WERE STILL UNDER THREAT

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.696
WHILE WE ARE IN RECOVERY.

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:45.530
AND TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS HAVE

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.065
GOTTEN TOGETHER AND THANK YOU TO

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.299
THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.301
GEOLOGIC SURVEY CAL FIRE THE U.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:51.969
S. FOR SERVICE THE STATE

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.538

COLLABORATE TO PUT TOGETHER OUR

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.776
RISK AND OR DEBRIS FLOW MAPS

00:32:58.843 --> 00:32:59.444
AFTER THE FIRE BECAUSE EVERYONE

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.245
YOU AFTER THIS FIRE WE ARE AT

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:02.547
RISK FOR SOME KIND OF. OTHER

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:04.349
DISASTER.

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:06.818
IT'S A RESPONSE WE DEVELOPED.

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:07.885
AFTER THE DISASTER SEVENTY TWO

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:09.654
OUR PROTOCOL TO ALERT RESIDENTS

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.255
WHEN IT RAINS TRIGGERED SUCH

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.957
THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER.

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.659
POTENTIAL OTHER DEBRIS FLOW AND

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:15.793
THIS PAST WINTER WE HAD TO

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.129
EVACUATE PEOPLE THREE TIMES

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.064
AFTER THE DEBRIS FLOW. BECAUSE

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.032
THE RAIN REACHED A CERTAIN

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.767
THRESHOLD AT TIMES IS TWENTY

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:23.968
FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.903
THAT WE HAD TO EVACUATE AND

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.771
ACOSTA TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.439
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.375
TIME IN PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS.

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:31.642
IT WASN'T JUST THIS AREA OF

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.177
MODESTY TO ITS BEING AND ALL THE

00:33:33.244 --> 00:33:34.645
AREAS OF THE FOOTHILLS SO MUCH

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:35.847
YOU KNOW CARPENTER IN

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.348
UNINCORPORATED AREAS.

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:39.350
OF THE COUNTY AGAIN A SCIENTIST

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.752
WE JUST HAVE A PRESENTATION TO

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:41.919
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAID

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.488
YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.456
BECAUSE THEY HIT THE FIRE WAS SO

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:46.891
HOT THE VEGETATION IS GOING TO

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.126
TAKE.

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.694
THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO COME BACK

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.062
AND HELP PREVENT AM FOR THE

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:53.164
DEBRIS FLOWS.

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.999
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REBUILDING.

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.934
AND SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES SO WE

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:58.636
HAVE THE TYPICAL CHALLENGES AS

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.271
WE TALK ABOUT FROM FIRE AND THEN

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.239
A MISTER NYGAARD ALLEN

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:02.373
CONSTRUCTION TALK ABOUT MORE

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.809
ABOUT WHAT HE SEEN IN THE FIELD.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.910
BUT ENSURE WE HAVE SEVERELY

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.845
DAMAGED AREAS WHERE THERE'S NO

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:10.148
LONGER THE SAME PARCEL LINES.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.350
THE LOT LINES HAVE MOVED AND SO

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.017
THE SURVEY MONUMENTS OF

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:14.152
DISAPPEARED BACK REDUCE

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.553
ESTABLISHING NEW SURVEY

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.021
MONUMENTS IN SOME AREAS SO.

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.990
HOMES OR NEAR A CREEK.

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:19.991
OUR CHANNEL ARE NOW IN THE CREEK

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:21.325
CHANNEL.

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:23.928
AS CHRIS OF WIDENED AND DEEPENED.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.296
ESTIMATES COMING OUT THIS SUMMER

00:34:25.363 --> 00:34:26.931
WITH THE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD MAPS

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:28.566
OF THAT WILL NO BETTER WHERE.

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:29.667
OUR RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.469
PREBUILT.

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:32.970
I'M WE'VE ASSIGNED CASE MANAGERS

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.539
TO HOMEOWNERS WHERE YOU KNOW

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:35.940
THREE MONTHS BEHIND EVERYONE

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:37.542
ELSE MEANT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:38.876
LIKELY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF

00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:40.778
ARCHITECTS HAVE A LOCAL CHAPTER

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.280
OF THE VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME FRY

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.048
PRIVATE FIRMS HAVE VOLUNTEERED

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:44.715
THEIR TIME BECAUSE OUR SING WITH

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:45.850
THE CHALLENGE. HOW DO YOU

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.152
REBUILD THESE KINDS OF AREAS SO

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.320
THEY'RE GIVING A RESIDENTS

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.087
ADVICE

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:51.522
LOOKING OUT THE TOPOGRAPHY IS

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:52.824
CHANGED IN FACT THERE WAS A

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.292
WORKSHOP THIS WEEKEND WITH THE

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:55.526
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.195
GROUP AND SOME OF OUR RESIDENTS?

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:58.329
AND AS WE'VE HEARD MANY

00:34:58.396 --> 00:34:59.864
RESIDENTS ARE UNDER INSURED HER

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:00.998
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE I

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:03.000
ASKED WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:03.568
OUT THERE THEY SAID IT'S A

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.069
PATCHWORK. NOT THE SAME

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:06.671
VOCABULARY PEOPLE DON'T

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.972
UNDERSTAND WHEN SOME INSURANCE

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.841
COVERAGE COSTS AND OTHERS DON'T.

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:10.875
SOME HAVE STARTED TO MILL

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:12.577
DEMOLITION OTHERS HAVE NOT SO IT

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:14.779
IS A WHOLE PATCHWORK OUT.

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:15.613
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.747
PHOTOS WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.249
MUD AND DEBRIS ON MANY OF OUR

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.585
PROPERTIES SO I'M LIKE A FIRE.

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:21.886
WHERE THERE'S DEBRIS IN ASH AND

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:24.021
ATTACH IT IS MATERIAL THAT THE

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:26.057
STATE OR A WILL REMOVE THIS IS

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.759
MUD? AND IT'S REALLY THE TOPSOIL

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:31.596
FROM THE FORESTS A ABOVE US SO

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:33.231
IT'S NOT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND

00:35:33.297 --> 00:35:34.599
AGAIN IT'S BEEN A VERY COSTLY

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:36.100
FOR PEOPLE TO REMOVE. WE'VE

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.435
ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS IN FACT TO

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.970
KEEP IT ON SITE UNTIL WE KNOW A

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.037
BIT MORE ABOUT REBUILDING

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.038
POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE THEY MAY

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.540
HAVE TO USE IT TO CHANGE THE

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.841
ELEVATION OF GRADING ON THEIR

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:44.141
PROPERTIES.

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.611
.

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:47.945
WE'VE INTRODUCED.

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:50.147
SON THIS RECENTLY IN WAS CALLED

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.449
ARE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND IT'S

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.984
AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM LIKE A

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.318
CRAIGSLIST FOR HOMEOWNERS CAN

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:55.953
POST THEIR SOIL AND ROCKS.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.755
AND OTHER PEOPLE CAN SAY THEY

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:58.589
THEY WANNA AND THEY'LL COME AND

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.657
PICK IT UP SO LANDSCAPE

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.259
COMPANIES ARE MAKING USE OF THE

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:01.926
ROCKS FROM RESIDENTIAL

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:04.028
PROPERTIES. FARMERS AND WINERIES

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.196
ARE COMING TO IMPORT THE

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.264
SENTIMENT FOR THEIR USE FOR

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.266
THEIR PROPERTIES.

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:08.866
SOME OF THE REST OF THE DEBRIS

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:09.767
GOES HAVE GONE TO PRIVATE

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:12.403
LANDFILLS SOME TO OUR LANDFILL.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.671
ANOTHER ISSUE I KNOW THAT

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:14.705
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:16.440
HAVE BUT LANDFILLS.

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:18.142
WE'RE REACHING OUR CAPACITY IN

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.176
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SO WE'VE

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.144
BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:21.879
AGENCIES TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.014
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS AND

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.382
WILL CONTINUE DO THAT BECAUSE IF

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.850
WE HAVE ANOTHER DEBRIS FLOW. WE

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:26.984
ARE WORD VIRGEN EITHER PARK

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:27.885
PASADENA.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:29.787
IN A LANDFILL.

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.122
SO I'M TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:32.189
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:33.758
REBUILDING THEIR.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.226
SO THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF ONE

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.028
OF THE. OTHER DEBRIS BASINS IN

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:40.331
THERE'S ELEVEN ANSWER BEFORE THE

00:36:40.398 --> 00:36:40.531
THE.

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:41.966
DEBRIS FLOW THESE THIS WAS

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.901
CLEARED OUT THIS IS RIGHT AFTER

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:45.436
THE DEBRIEF AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:46.837
COMPLETELY FILLED AND ACTUALLY

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.606
OVERTOPPED.

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:49.774
IT COSTS THE ARMY CORPS OF

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.942
ENGINEERS WHO WERE MISSION TASK

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.243
DO THIS A HUNDRED MILLION

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.111
DOLLARS TO CLEAR UP DEBRIS.

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.146
IT'S SO JUST LIKE.

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.514
THAT ON CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WE

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.316
HAVE A A LOCAL SHARE OF THOSE

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.550
COSTS WILL BE ASKING THE

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.885
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WAIVER NOW

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.386
THAT WE KNOW THAT DISCIPLINE OF

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:03.988
THE CALIFORNIA. COUNTIES GONE

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.389
AWAY FROM THEIR LOCAL MATCH.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:06.490
WE HAD DAMAGES TO OUR DEBRIS

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.793
BASINS ROADS BRIDGES CULVERTS.

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.962
AND AND LIKE I SAID WE HAD SIX

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.697
BRIDGES THAT WERE DAMAGED ONLY

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.532
TO UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW.

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.299
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SHORT

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:15.933
LONG TERM.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.702
SOLUTIONS.

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:19.370
LIKE CAN WE BRACE THE HILL OTHER

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.771
ENGINEERING THINGS WE CAN DO TO

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:21.806
KEEP THE ROCKS UP THERE.

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.908
CAN EXPAND AND FORTIFY THE

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.443
DEBRIS BASINS CAN WE CREATE MORE

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:27.144
OPEN SPEAK SPACE NEAR THE CREEK

00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.212
SO THEY COME BECOME NATURAL

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.714
DEBRIS BASINS ARE WIDEN THE

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.015
CULVERTS ARE STILL LOOKING AT

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.650
ALL THAT. WILL BE SUBMITTING

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.685
THINGS TO THE STATE BE MATH WERE

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.121
HOME HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM.

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:39.590
.

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:40.358
LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT TO

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.459
BROUGH BASINS ARE BLIND SO MUCH

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:44.395
ABOUT THEM AND REALLY BECAUSE.

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:46.263
AM I HAVE TO HAND IT TO CAL FIRE

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.199
IN MY STAFF AND OH YES YOU JUST

00:37:48.265 --> 00:37:49.533
SAID AS THE FIRE WAS STILL

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.601
BURNING THEY SAID WE NEED TO

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:51.836
CLEAR OUT THE DEBRIS BASINS.

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.104
BECAUSE IF IT RAINS WE'RE GONNA

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.271
HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.506
AND THEY DID THAT MAY SAVE MANY

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:57.408
LIVES BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.609
WE TALK ABOUT FINANCIALLY WE.

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.811
.

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:03.514
WE A HAD A PROPERTY TAX IMPACT

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:04.715
LIKE THE OTHER COUNTIESAN

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.251
INVOLVED. BUT VERMONT ACETO SO

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:08.653
EVERYONE THINKS OF HONESTY DOES

PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT THAT SO WE'RE

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.442

MAPPING THAT LOOKS BELOW THE

00:40:38.736 --> 00:40:40.070
BURN AREA TO SEE HOW MUCH GROWTH

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:41.205
VEGETATIONS OCCURRING.

FOR THE THE OTHER LOCAL

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.840
GOVERNMENT.

REPRESENTATIVES.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.344
PEOPLE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:40.944
IN THE HAVE FIGURED OUT PRETTY

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.079
QUICKLY.

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:43.881
WAS THERE A RIGHT CHOICE OR

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:45.682
KNOWS IT REALLY INDIVIDUAL FOR

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:46.550
FOR EACH PERSON THAT THEY TO

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.685

YOU KNOW IT'S A AS YOU UNTIL

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:52.189

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:53.223
YOU KNOW IT'S A FASCINATING

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.691
THING BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALIZE

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.860
IS FIRST OF ALL. IF LET'S SAY WE

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.629
DID NOT OPT IN TO THE GOVERNMENT

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.531
PROGRAM AND OFFER THAT WE HAD

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:02.132
FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED HOMES

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.201
DOWN IN CINEMA COUNTY. IF WE HAD

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.536
NOT WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'RE

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:07.938
CONSCIOUS OPENING UP EVERYBODY

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.773
TO FIND CONTRACTORS.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.108
TWO DO IT WHO ARE LICENSED AND

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:13.077
SPECIALIZED IN WHO COME IN HERE

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.912
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY AS MUCH AS

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.480
YOU CAN BLAME THE ARMY CORPS FOR

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.981
INEFFECTIVE.

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.650
YOU KNOW NOT BEING NIMBLE CAN

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:21.185
YOU IMAGINE THE LOGISTICS OF

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.486
HAVING THAT MANY DIFFERENT

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.022
PEOPLE FLYING AROUND EACH OTHER

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:27.458
WITH. WITH FOR THAT MUCH OF AN

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:28.992
EFFORT IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S IT'S

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.828
NOT CON OF FEASIBLE THE SECOND

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.262
THING IS IS THAT.

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:34.331
SO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM COVERS

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.499
YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE INSURANCE

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.101
HAS FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL BUT

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.402
WHATEVER GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:39.903
THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.738
HAVE WITH THE PRIVATE COMPANY.

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:43.240
NOW IF YOU LOOK AT LAKE COUNTY

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.541
THEY PAY THEN THEY HAVE AN

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.110
AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.411
DOLLARS FOR THEIR.

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.546
FOR THEIR RECOVERY EXCUSE ME

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.348
FOR THE DEBRIS REMOVAL PER LOT.

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:52.382
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLY HAVE

00:45:52.449 --> 00:45:53.884
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY THOUSAND

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.752
BUCKS TO REMOVE IT. BUT EMBEDDED

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:56.820
INTO THAT PEOPLE COULD

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.388
DEFINITELY POKE FINGERS AND SAY

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:58.922
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:00.591
GOVERNMENT COST.

00:46:00.657 --> 00:46:02.192
I CAN GET IT FOR THIRTY FIVE

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.093
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE LIKE

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.394
YOU'RE RIGHT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:05.229
YOU'RE BRINGING IN SOMEBODY FOR

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:07.231
THIRTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR WHO'S NOT

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:08.932
WEARING. A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.734
AND COMING IN AND DOING IT. IS

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.302
BY US GOING INTO THAT PROGRAM IN

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:13.670
MANAGING CONTRACTING IT DID

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:16.006
PROVIDE. YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:17.574
BE WAY MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:19.109
BUT YET YES HE'S QUESTIONS HERE

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.177
LIKE SHOULD WE REALLY BE

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.578
REBUILDING OUR COMMUNITY AND

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:22.880
HAVE A CLASS ACTION FOR.

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:24.681
.

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.817
FOR FOR LUNG CANCER ME SOMETHING

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:28.585
YOU KNOW MY FOR YOU KNOW TWENTY

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:29.887
YEARS FROM NOW.

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.688
SO MY THING IS IS THAT IT WAS

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:33.157
CLARK KENT CLASSIC GOVERNMENT

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:36.527
WHICH IS IT WAS A BLUNT OBJECT.

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:38.495
AND WE NEED AT THAT AT THAT TIME.

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:40.731
AND DID YOU PAY MORE FOR IT YES

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:41.832
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THE

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:42.366
ALTERNATIVE

00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:44.368
AT THIS POINT.

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:45.169
THE THING THAT WE NEED TO

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:46.603
TRANSFER TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IS

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.871
THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO PICK

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:50.407
THIS STUFF UP FROM VALID SOURCES.

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:51.942
EVERYBODY SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.677
AND EFFORT MAY BECOME PREY TO

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.379
CONTRACTORS AND OTHER PEOPLE TO

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:57.014
RECREATE IT ALL THE TIME.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.081
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS PEOPLE SHOW

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.683
UP PAPER PARACHUTED IN THEIR

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.385
LIKE HEY WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:03.554
REPRESENT YOU TO FEMA. AND THEN

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.322
PAY US BACK SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:06.390
PAY US WITH THE FEMALE DOLLARS

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.858
THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT YOU DON'T

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.126
KNOW IF YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM.

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:10.794
WHOEVER WHATEVER.

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:12.763
SO MY ISSUE IS THAT.

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:13.330
IS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:14.531
SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES AND I

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:16.567
THINK THAT'S.

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:17.201
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH TO

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.869

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.921
BECAUSE IT'S

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.389

FEEDBACK COME THROUGH AND FIX

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:54.758
THOSE THOSE PROBLEMS. ACTUALLY

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.927
JUST SAID SHUT DOWN LAST WEEK

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.295
THE.

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.930
TOLL NUMBER TO CALL IF YOU HAD

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.531
AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.033
OVER TO THE COUNTY NOW I BELIEVE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.568
IS BACK UP AND RUNNING AGAIN

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:05.769
ABOUT WE HAVE NOT HAD TOO MANY

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.738
OF THOSE GOING FORWARD.

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:09.239
S. ONE FINAL QUICK QUICK

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.707
QUESTION AND THAT IS SAM.

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:11.675
SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE A

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:12.909
SEATO AND OBVIOUSLY THE

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.745
GEOGRAPHY IS DIFFERENT NOW THAN

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:16.012
IT IS IN SOME COUNTY.

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.381
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER THAT WE

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:18.915
WERE VERY FORTUNATE THIS YEAR

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.150
NUMBER ONE THE TIMING OF THE

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:22.152
FIRED TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK BY

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:23.520
PEOPLE HELPING TO.

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:25.222
SHORT THINGS UP SO THAT WE

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.490
WOULDN'T HAVE. BUT I CAN'T HELP

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:29.493
BUT WONDER IF NEXT YEAR. WITH

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:30.861
THE BURNED TREES WHERE THE ROOTS

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:32.863
ARE NOW ROTTED IF WE COULDN'T BE

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:34.731
IN A SITUATION WE COULD HAVE STE

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.066
COULDN'T COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.268
ISSUES AND SO. SO HOW ARE YOU

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:40.737
LOOKING AT MAINTAINING THOSE

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:42.506
THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN.

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:45.342
THOUGH THE. THE THE BREAK IN

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.277
AND WORDS TO PREVENT THESE YOU

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:49.413
KNOW. SEMIS LANDSLIDES FROM OR

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:50.714
OF MITIGATING FOR POTENTIAL

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.715
LANDSLIDES BECAUSE THOSE

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.250
WADDELL'S AND ALL THOSE THINGS

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:55.252
THEY DEGRADE OVER TIME SO SO AND

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:56.853
AS WE GET INTO THE NEXT RAINY

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.856
SEASON WHICH. YOU KNOW IT'S MADE

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:00.624
ISN'T THAT FAR DOWN THE ROAD.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.725
THE DEAD THE DEAD AND DYING

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:02.592
TREES THAT WE DON'T LOSE OUR

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:04.194
RATES.

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.729
AT THAT WE CAN GET SOME PRETTY

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:06.463
TORRENTIAL RAINS IN CINEMA

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.365
COUNTY. AS YOU OBVIOUSLY DID AND

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:08.765
AND.

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.968
AND I'M ON A SEATO SO WHERE DO

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:13.870
HOW YOU HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT.

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:14.871
YEAH I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.406
SOMETHING THAT'S TOP OF MIND FOR

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:18.508
ALL OF US AS WE DO THIS NOT JUST

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.843
FOR THAT BUT ALSO DON'T FORGET

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.311
THAT IN OUR AREA THE BIGGEST

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.979
THREAT IS STILL GOING TO BE. A

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:24.581
BIG EARTHQUAKE SO HOW IS WE'RE

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.249
DEALING WITH THIS DISASTER DO WE

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.251
CONTINUE TO PLAN FOR WHAT'S TO

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:29.553
COME THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.254
HYDRA SEED WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:32.823
ON THE HILLS. TO TRY TO PREVENT

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.291
THAT THEN THERE'S ALSO LOOKING

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:36.526
AT AREAS WHERE WE KNOW OUR WATER

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:37.727
SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:39.596
COMPROMISED WHERE THE PIPES OF

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:41.631
LITERALLY BURNED IN THE GROUND.

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.333
AT HAVE MELTED KNOWING THAT

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.468
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:46.470
ON THOSE AREAS AS WELL AND TRIED

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:49.272
TO DO SOME MAPPING AROUND THAT.

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:51.141
MIKE SCREW ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.843
AN EMERGENT IT MONITORS.

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.377
THAT WE APPROVED IN THE OTHER

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:56.112
FUNDING BUDGET FOR.

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.481
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BUCKS TO

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:57.747
PUT INTO.

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.683
YEAH.

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.918
WE WE HAVE DUBBED TWELVE STE A

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:02.719
EXCUSE ME TWELVE RAIN GAUGES AND.

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:05.155
.

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:05.755
EXCUSE ME FOURTEEN RAIN GAUGES

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.157
TWELVE.

00:52:07.224 --> 00:52:09.059
DREAM CAGES TO PROVIDE US WITH

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:11.261
EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND.

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:13.663
ONE OF THE.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.965
IF THEY WERE WE WE DO OBVIOUSLY

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.800
CAN GET A LOT OF RAIN I THINK IT

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:17.534
THAT WHAT HAPPENED AND

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.302
MONOSYLLABIC ARE DESCRIBED AS A

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.604
RAIN BOMB.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.506
IT WAS I THINK WAS A HALF INCH

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:26.843
OF RAIN IN THE HALF HOUR.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.912
EVEN IMAGINE THAT I MEAN IT'S

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.013
LIKE BEING UNDER WATER I WOULD

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.247
THINK.

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.615
BUT.

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.383
THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.352
DEFINITELY AREAS OF CONCERN ITEM

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:37.721
WE ARE. ARE TO PLUG A FEAST

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.256
MEANT THAT COULD HAPPEN BETTER

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.123
TOPOGRAPHY IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.692
THAN. WHAT YOU HAVE THERE AND I

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:44.160
WOULD OF BEEN A WE CAN MAKE OUR

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.196
BANKERS CROSS WE ALSO HAD PP

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:48.031
CLASS WITH ABOUT? FOR IN A WE

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.033
WERE LUCKY WE HAD A WHICH CALL

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.402
THE IDEAL WATER YEAR THE IDEAL

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.304
WINTER WHERE WE WOULD GET THESE

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:56.139
AND NOT FROM A FLOOD CONTROL

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:56.840
PERSPECTIVE.

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.975
THAT WE WOULD GET THESE GREAT

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:00.510
LITTLE STORMS COME IN AND WET

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:02.412
THE GROUND STARTS STUFF GROWING

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:06.182
AND SO. THAT THEY ARE.

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.584
THERE OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS THAT

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.818
THREAT BY I TYPE I KNOW I'VE

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.320
BEEN OUT THE LOWER IN SEVERAL OF

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:11.488
OUR REGIONAL PARK OF SKYLER

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:13.723
REGIONAL PARK AND. THEY ARE

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.191
THEY'RE REALLY COMING BACK WELL

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:17.460
IT'S IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY OF

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:17.794
THE.

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.262
HOW MUCH THE POTENTIATION YOU'D

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.830
THINK IS DEAD THAT ACTUALLY

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:21.731
ISN'T?

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:23.433
SO WILL WE KEEP OUR FINGERS

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:24.935
CROSSED AND HOPE WE DON'T GET A.

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:28.004
HALF.

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:28.538
HAVE YOU GUYS I'VE BEEN

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:29.239
AVAILABLE THOUGH IS THIS IS TWO

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.107
TO THREE YEARS AFTER THE AFTER

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.175
THE FIRES IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.843
GET THE BIG FLOODS. OR THE

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:35.946
DEBRIS FLOWS EXCUSE ME WHATEVER

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:36.680
THEIR HAD.

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.448
BUT THE OTHER THING IS IS I I

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:39.449
DO WANT TO STRESS THAT PRIVATE

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.484
PROPERTY WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.452
ISSUES IS BECAUSE.

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.620
UNLESS YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.120
LIKE.

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:46.089
LIKE UP WAY UP NORTH WITH WHERE

00:53:46.156 --> 00:53:47.891
YOU HAVE A LOT OF BLM LAND OR%

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:49.759
FOR SERVICE LAND LIKE IN SOME OF

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:50.860
YOUR DISTRICTS.

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.262
YOU KNOW SOME MEMBER WOULD LIKE

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:53.964
IN A WAY UP NORTH YOU HAVE TO

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.532
DEAL PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS ALL

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.933
OVER THE PLACE AND THERE'S NO

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.501
MONEY TO GO IN AND DO THAT SO

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.203
WHAT WE DID WAS ACTUALLY USED.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.304
SOME OF THE PHILANTHROPIC MONEY

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:02.572
LIKE FRANCE AND SOME CLEAN POWER

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:03.907
BUT MONEY ON THE TABLE WE ENDED

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:06.142
UP GIVEN. FIFTY GRAND EACH TO

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.043
ABOUT FOUR DIFFERENT.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.312
WATERSHED GROUPS THAT JUST WENT

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.981
OUT AND THEY WERE LIKE WATERSHED

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.716
MARINES PUT UP WADDELL'S DOING

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:14.084
ALL THIS WORK. AND THAT IS A

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.219
HUGE GAP THAT NOTHING IS THERE

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.321
TO FILL. US DEPARTMENT

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:20.223
AGRICULTURE HOW SOME PROGRAMS

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.359
BUT IT IS IT. YOU KNOW WE TALKED

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.927
ACTUALLY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.962
WOULDN'T BOTH YOU AND YOU KNOW

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.797
THAT CHAIR LEVINE AND YOU GUYS

WERE REALLY HELPFUL WITH US

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:29.733
TRYING TO. THINK THROUGH THE

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.401
PROCESS OF HIS THERE IS THAT

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.769
WATER BOND OR IT YOU KNOW IS

00:54:32.836 --> 00:54:33.870

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:36.773
THROUGH OUR RESOURCE

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.241
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS TO DO

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.176
THIS BUT I MEAN YOU'RE ALWAYS

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:40.577
PLAYING CATCH UP.

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:41.978
AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.480
RIGHT I THINK THAT I WANT TO

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:45.048
THANK YOU GUYS FOR DOING YOUR

WORK IS THAT.

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:48.184
ALWAYS REACTIVE AND EVERYBODY'S

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.452
LEARNING THEIR OWN LESSON RATHER

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.221
THAN LEARNING FROM OTHERS THAT'S

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.289
THE DANGER GOING AND FUTURE.

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:54.324
YEAH I DO WANT TO PUT IN A QUICK

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:56.292
PLUG TO IN OUR AREA THERE'S A

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.560
SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.195
CALLED PEPPER WORD PEPPER WOULD

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:00.897
PRESERVE. AND THE PRESERVES

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.065
ESSENTIALLY A RESEARCH

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:02.899
INSTITUTION.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:05.268
THAT LOOKS AT THE WAY THAT

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:08.338
NATURE REACTS TO CIRCUMSTANCES

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:10.340
HALF OF THE PRESERVE WAS I IN

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.308
THE FIRES OWN HALF OF IT WAS NOT

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:13.476
THEY'LL BE ABLE TAXI MAKE

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.445
RESEARCH COMPARISONS. BASED ON

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.180
WHAT THEY SEE AND INTERESTINGLY

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.481
ENOUGH PARTS OF IT HAD GONE

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.883
THROUGH PRESCRIPTIVE BURNS AHEAD

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.651
OF TIME AT HALF OF IT HAVE GONE

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:22.686
THROUGH SOME CLEARING AHEAD OF

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.820
TIME. AND LOOKING AT THE

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:24.921
DIFFERENCE IN HOW IT WAS

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.856
IMPACTED BY THE FIRE YOU HAVE

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.825
FIFTY STUDIES GOING RIGHT NOW ON

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:31.061
IT ALREADY WITH A BEFORE AND NOW

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:33.963
pSOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA FOR

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.565
THIS BODY TO LOOK AT IN THE NEXT

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:36.666
COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.934
THANK AND I DO HOPE THIS BODY

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.035
AND LOOK AT THAT DATA.

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:39.836
IN THE FUTURE

WITH A FEW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.414
WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT

00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:32.315
WERE HAPPENING BACK IN THE

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:33.650
DISTRICTS WITH THE FIRE AND HOW

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.652
IT IMPACTS A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:36.319
LIVE IN AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:37.921

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:43.092
YOU KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF WE HAVE

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.460
A LOT OF MEMBERS TO LIVE IN THE

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.129
FIRE IMPACTED AREAS.

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:47.597
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT OF

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:48.865
THESE MEMBERS THEY NOT ONLY LOST

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:50.066
THEIR HOMES ARE TRYING TO FIND

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.501
OUT LIKE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:53.770
CONTINUE. TO MOVE AHEAD WITH

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:54.971
THEIR OWN CAREERS A LOT OF THEM

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.406
ARE PRINTS AS WE HAVE ABOUT SIX

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:57.941
HUNDRED APPRENTICES JUSTIN

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.342
SINAMA ALONE.

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.411
AND SO AS WE BECAME ENGAGED WITH

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.313
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WITH

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:04.581
FEMA AND SOME OF THE CONTRACTING

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:06.115
PROCEDURES THAT THEY HAVE FOR

00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:09.085
THE IMMEDIATE CLEAN UP. IT WAS.

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:10.320
RARELY AVAILABLE FOR A SECOND

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:10.720
IT'S NOTICEABLE.

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:12.989
THAT.

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.390
THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BASS AS

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:16.092
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.228
NECESSARY RESOURCES THERE AND SO

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.629
THERE WAS A LOT OF DISASTERS

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.197
DURING THAT PARTICULAR TIME AND

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.499
THERE THERE ISN'T. AN INDUSTRY

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:24.601
AROUND DISASTER THERE ARE

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:27.136
CONTRACTORS THAT GO NATIONWIDE.

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:29.572
AS YOU HAVE KNOWN AND THEY THEY

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.608
BID OUT ON FEMALE PROJECTS AND

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:33.142
SO DURING THIS TIME YOU HAVE THE

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:35.311
DISASTERS IN THE EAST COAST. AND

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:36.613
PORTO RICO.

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.114
SO ALLOW THOSE CONTRACTORS HAD

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:40.583
LOCKED IN THOSE LONG TERM YOU

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.252
KNOW SORT OF CONTRACTS AND SO

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:43.987
WHEN FEMA CAME TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:45.154
THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT A

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.923
LOT OF THE. COMPANIES THAT WORK

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.958
HERE ALREADY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.393
ACCESS THOSE FUNDS OVER THE

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.794
THOSE CONTRACTS.

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.329
AND SO THEY WERE IN THE FUNDS

00:58:53.396 --> 00:58:54.998
THAT THEY WERE PUTTING OUT NOW

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:56.799
THEN YOU THEN SUBSEQUENTLY

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.735
RETRACTED THE WAY THAT THEY

00:58:58.801 --> 00:58:59.836
ORIGINALLY PUT OUT THE FIRST

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:02.205
PROCUREMENT. AND THEN ISSUE THEM

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:04.173
OUT AT SERVICE CONTRACTS.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.775
INTERNET SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.243
CREATES A NEW DESIGNATION OF

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.078
CONTRACT AND AS WAS STATED

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:11.481
BEFORE IT LOWERED THE ROLE THE

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:13.082
WAGE RATES OF A LOT OF THESE

00:59:13.149 --> 00:59:14.784
LABORERS THAT WERE ACTUALLY

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:16.619
BUILT BUILDING THOSE PROJECTS.

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:20.023
SO NOT ONLY. WAS IT NON BC FOR

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:22.091
US IN TERMS OF OF A UNION SCALE

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:24.394
WAGES WAS NOT COMPETITIVE FOR

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.795
THESE CONTRACTORS TO BOTTOM BID

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:28.064
ON THIS WORK. BUT IT WAS ALSO A

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:30.433
PROBLEM FOR THE YOUNG NONUNION

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.268
SECTOR OF CONTRACTORS IN THOSE

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.203
AREAS NOT KEEPING MONEY YOU WILL

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.172
KNOW THAT. WE OFTEN FIGHT WITH

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.574
THOSE SAME NONUNION CONTRACTORS

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.109
ASSOCIATIONS HEARING COMMITTEES

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:42.078
SUCH AS THESE AND OFTEN FIGHTING

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:43.446
ABOUT. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.014
STANDARDS WHETHER RETRAINING

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.382
APPRENTICESHIP OR ACTUAL WAGE

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:47.583
RATES.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.686
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE'RE

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:51.321
BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE BECAUSE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.622
EVEN THE NONUNION CONTRACTORS

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.057
COULD NOT COMPETE.

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:54.857
WITH SOME OF THOSE.

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:57.293
RATES THAT WERE BEING PAID FROM

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.128
THESE NATIONAL CONTRACTOR

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.964
ORGANIZATION SO YOU WOULD FIND

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.565
THAT PEOPLE THAT DID NOT LIVE IN

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.700
AND AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:04.334
WILL COME IN.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.336
AND ACTUALLY SEE

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.137
TO PERFORM THE WORK NOW. IN

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:10.606
DOING SO. IN A LOT OF THE ISSUES

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:11.140
THAT WERE WOULD THAT WERE

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:11.441
MENTIONED.

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:12.842
BOB

FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.379
PROTECTION.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.847
DIDN'T HAVE THE TRAINING THEY

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:20.283
WERE HAZMAT READY OR CERTIFIED

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.818
FACT A LOT OF OUR UNIONS HAVE TO

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:24.153
RAMP UP IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.756
WITHIN OUR APPRENTICESHIP

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.291
PROGRAMS LOOK IN THE AREA.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.660
RETIREES CAME OUT YOU KNOW FROM

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.895
THE RETIREMENT APPRENTICES

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:35.064
JOURNEY PERSONS THEY ALL HAD TO

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.066
GO TO THE HAZMAT READING ITS

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:39.168
COURSE AND CATCH UP TO WHERE

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.636
THEY WERE BEFORE OUR PENSION

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:43.039
PROGRAMS ACTUALLY RAN. DAY AND

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.208
NIGHT OF FORTY HOUR OSHA

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:46.542
TRAINING TO GET PEOPLE READY SO

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.578
THEY CAN GO OUT AND DO THE WORK

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.879
AND GET PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.514
FEET. BUT A LOT OF THESE OUT OF

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.783
STATE NONUNION INDIVIDUALS

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.585
DIDN'T HAVE THE PROTECTION THEY

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:56.886
DIDN'T HAVE THE PROTECTIVE

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.221
CLOTHING OU DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.523
APPLY IT AND HOW TO USE IT

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.257
THEMSELVES.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.392
THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.394
INDIVIDUAL THE PROBLEM FOR A

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.695
THINK ALLOW THE COMMUNITY AS

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:06.796
WELL BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT ONLY

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.297
TRAINED. SUCH A DEAL WITH

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.500
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THEY OFTEN

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.935
WILL DISPOSE OF IT IN WAYS THAT

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.604
ARE NOT NECESSARILY HELPFUL TO

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.339
LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THAT YOU HAVE.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.074
ADDED LONG TERM NEGATIVE

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.575
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.944
BECAUSE GOD DEBRIS WAS NOT

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.579
HANDLED CORRECTLY EVEN. HOW YOU

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.181
COLLECTED THE BREED TO HOW YOU

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.816
ACTUALLY SHIP IT OUT OF THE

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.985
AFFECTED AREA? HAS TO BE DONE

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:30.720
CORRECTLY IN FACT SOME OF OUR

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.255
TRUCKS PARKED ON TARPS

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:33.656
SO THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY PULLING

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:36.192
SOME OF THAT TOXIC DEBRIS ARE IN

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:36.826
THEIR WHEELS AND THEN SPREADING

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.628
IT AROUND. SO THESE ARE A LOT OF

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:39.896
THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN THEY GO

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:43.399
INTO. OF THE IMMEDIATE ARE AT

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.802
WORK FOR RECOVERY

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.570
OUT OF THERE WE ARE ARMY OUR

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.605
UNIONS ARE PROUD OF OF THE OTHER

THE WORKER SHORTAGE.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.923
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS A

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.992
SORT OF A LINEMAN DISCONNECT

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:44.427
THERE'S GOING TO BE TONS OF WORK

IF A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.396
MENTIONED WITH REGARD TO

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.332
PERMITTING FUNDING. THE

INSURANCE ISSUES GET RESOLVED

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:52.835
BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BUILDING

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.170
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:03:00.643
AND WHEN THE THAT ARE PAID OF SIGNIFICANTLY

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.111
LOWER RATE THAN A LOT OF THE

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.280
JOURNEY PERSONS THEY'RE READY TO

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.349
GO OUT AND BE PUT TO WORK.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:07.917
AND SO WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.552
OUR CONTRACTOR ASSOCIATIONS AND

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.786
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THOSE

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.155
WORKERS ARE RE THERE THEY DON'T

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.956
HAVE TO BE SHIPPED THEN. THEY

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.659
DON'T HAVE TO BE POWERS DANNY

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:17.960

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.150
THEY'RE ALSO WILLING TO TALK TO

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.019

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:43.819
WAGE RATES THAT COULD BE

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.488
AVAILABLE SAID THESE COMMUNITIES

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.789
CAN BE BUILT UP AS QUICKLY AS

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.591
POSSIBLE. PARTICLE YEAH I WOULD

HIGHER SKILL SETS WHEN YOU'RE

JUST ONE SINGLE PALM AS A

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.669
MULTITUDE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.270
ISSUES THAT CAME UP WAS IN

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:43.272
COFFEE PARK. WE HAD I DON'T KNOW

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.041
HOW MANY HOMES GO. A DEVELOPER

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.475
HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WANTED TO

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:47.943
FACE COULD DO THE ECONOMIES OF

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.013
SCALE GOING TO TAKE IT OVER.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.281
INNOCENTS BACKED UP.

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:53.316
NOT BECAUSE TO EXPENSIVE FOR HIM

THE BAY AREA. AND TO DRIVE UP TO.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:01.424
CENTER ROSA IS NO HOUSING.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.326
WE NOTE THE POPLAR THROW THINGS

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:04.994
OR ARE IN THE WAY.

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.996
AND THERE'S MANY FIVE RESIDENTS

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.465

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:10.499
THE HILLS THEIR ONE OFFS.

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:12.501
SO I MEAN THERE'S A LOT HERE IN

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.403
I JUST I I I I JUST LOOK FOR

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.539

THE GENTLEMAN CAME FROM FROM THE

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.279
BAY AREA SAID. IN THIS IS A

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.980
PENCIL OUT WELL RIGHT. IN THE

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.049
MEANTIME I HAVE PEOPLE WITHOUT A

ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IT'S

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.219
UPSETTING TO ME TO THINK THAT

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:31.854
BUT HOW DO WE MOVE THIS ALONG.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.389
I'M I THINK THE COUNTY HAS DONE

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.391
A PHENOMENAL JOB OF TRYING TO

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.193
MOVE PERMITTING ALONG IN THEIR

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:38.594
INSPECTIONS ALONG I THINK THAT

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.497
THEY HAVE. STEPPED UP SANTA ROSA

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:42.131
STEPPED UP TO COUNTY STEPPED UP

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.165
SO.

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:43.999
THIS ONE PIECE LIKE WE HOW WE

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:46.535
GET THERE.

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.770
AS WELL AS IT IS JUST THE

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.472
MATERIALS THEMSELVES REPEAL OF

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.207
CEMENT I CAN GET LUMBER RIGHT

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.742
NOW I CAN'T GET THIS YOU KNOW SO.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:54.343
THERE'S A LOT TO THIS IS NOT

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.679
JUST I'M NOT FINGER POINTING AT

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.247
LABOR NECESSARY GOING TO SING.

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.782
THERE'S SO MUCH HERE AND WE

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.250
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT SO IN

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:01.884
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE SAME VOTE

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:02.985
SO.

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:03.319
UNTIL I THINK.

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:04.387
.

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.855
WENT WHEREVER THERE'S WORK

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.123
AVAILABLE ONCE BUT IT'S PRETTY

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.791
GOOD CONSTRUCTION RIGHT AND

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.259
THERE IS A A.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.728
SIGURD ECONOMY RIGHT NOW FOR A

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.096
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:15.598
AND THEN THAT THEIR WAGES

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:16.899
ACTUALLY BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.734
I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.236
ARMED WITH REGARDS TO LUMBER

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.505
MATERIALS AND AND ALL THAT BUT I

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.640
THINK THAT IT JUST.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.207
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BUILDING

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.209
BOOM AND YOU LOOK IN AN AREA

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.511
THAT NEEDS A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:30.246
MATERIALS ALL AT ONCE AND I

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.947
THINK THAT IN THAT CASE. THERE

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.449
IS SORT OF A MARKET TO TRY TO

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:34.517
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:35.651
THAT THING THAT'S WHERE

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.886
GOVERNMENT CAN STEP IN. AND

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.587
ASSIST A LOT OF THESE HOMEOWNERS

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:40.222
AND TRY TO HELP THEM GET OFF ON

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.424
THEIR FEET WITH GRANTS OR

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.958
WHATEVER IT MAY BE. I THINK.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:44.493
.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.328
WE'VE HEARD EXAMPLES OF THAT AS

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.264
WELL WHERE A CONTRACTOR HAS

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:48.798
AHEAD JUST CAN'T FIND THE

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:49.932
WORKERS.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.066
AND WHEN I HEAR THAT I

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.635
IMMEDIATELY CALL MY LOCAL

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.370
BUILDING TRADES WORK BUT UNIONS

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:55.838
AND SAY HEY THIS CONTRACTOR HAD

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.339
JUST SIGNAL THAT THEY CANNOT

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:58.974
FIND THE WORKERS. HAVE THEY

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.776
CALLED YOUR HALL.

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.311
HAVE THEY TALKED YOU HAD THEY

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.079
DID A SURVEY OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:05.381
PROGRAMS AND WHO'S ON THE BOOKS

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.715
AND IT WAS ON I'M IN THE

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.451
HALLWAYS WHEN FOR WORK. NONE OF

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.186
THAT HAS HAPPENED SO I THINK

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.154
THERE'S A DISCONNECT OR PERHAPS

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.657
A FEAR OF NOT REACHING OUT TO

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:15.791
THE BUILDING TRADES UNIONS

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.193
BECAUSE THEY WILL BELIEVE THAT

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.561
THERE'S GONNA BE A COST INCREASE.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:19.728
THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED THE USE

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.163
OF APPRENTICES BECAUSE THAT

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.631
APPRENTICE WAGE RATE IS FORTY

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.633
PERCENT THAT OF A JOURNEY PERSON

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.668
WAGE RATE.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.002
SO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WHEN

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.137
YOU'RE TURNING OFF A FIRST YEAR

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:29.371
APPRENTICE.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:30.673
AND IF THOSE JOBS WERE TO BE

01:08:30.739 --> 01:08:31.974
OPEN I THINK THE OPPRESSION

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.909
PAUL'S WOULD OPEN UP FOR MORE

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.478
NEW WORKERS TO ACTUALLY ACCESS

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:36.812
AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN YOU KNOW

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.681
ONE REAL QUICK EXAMPLE.

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:39.548

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.194
IN CONSTRUCTION.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.929
SECONDARY TO THAT HAS BEEN THE

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.497
CHALLENGE OF ACCESS AMONG US IT

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.932
WAS ACTUALLY CLOSED AND RIGHTLY

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.133

EFFORT WAS UNDERWAY. UPON.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:57.406
THE.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.640
YOU THE OTHER EDGE OF THE SWORD

01:12:58.707 --> 01:12:59.908
HOWEVER HAS BEEN THAT THESE

DIG THEM OUT.

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:07.616
AND SO THERE IS SOME

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:08.951
SIGNIFICANT ONGOING DAMAGE

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.085

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.955
EVEN ONCE TOWN WAS OPENED UP TO

THOSE ELEVEN WEEKS OF HEAVY

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:38.914
CLEAN UP WAS.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:40.315
.

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:43.485
FINDING DEBRIS SITES THAT WE

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.320
COULD AFFORD TO EXPORT TO.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.588
OR THAT OUR CLIENTS COULD

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:48.423
AFFORD TO EXPORT TO.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.058
DOT WAS SOME TECHNICAL

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.326
DEMOLITION CHALLENGE THE LIKES

01:13:51.393 --> 01:13:53.796
OF WHICH. YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.831
THAT'S NOT THE PURVIEW

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:56.698
TYPICALLY.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.433
OF A HOME BUILDER.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.602
AND I PUT CASH FLOW ON THE LIST

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:01.937
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS WAS A

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.106
LIMITING FACTOR AND THE NUMBER

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.507
OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE.

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.910
ULTIMATELY ABLE TO HELP SO.

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:10.412
AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CLEANUP

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.214
PHASE WE HAVE FRONTED A LOT MORE

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.482
THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.017
DOLLARS. OF.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:17.119
UNPAID RECEIVABLES THAT'S A

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.554
HEAVY BURDEN FOR A SMALL PRIVATE

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.755
COMPANIES TO BEAR.

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.523
AND THAT DID ULTIMATELY.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.292
CURTAIL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.093
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP AND SO.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.929
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPEED OF

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.497
THE CLEAN UP WORK VERSES THE

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:29.665
SPEED WITH WHICH.

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:32.401
INSURERS WERE ABLE TO PAY OUT.

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.902
ON THOSE COSTS.

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.204
.

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.339
WHO WAS WHO WAS IMPACTFUL IN

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.807
THAT WAY?

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:43.912
OUT FOR US.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.047
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE AND CROTCH

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:46.515
US STANDING IN FRONT OF A SMALL

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.083
MOUNTAIN OF MUD THAT WE'VE

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.017
STOCKPILED FOR.

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.486
EXPORT FROM THIS PROPERTY.

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:54.923
AND IN THIS GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:57.326
THAT INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.060
OWNERS.

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.461
THAT WERE WORKING FOR A HAVE

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.797
HAD TO EXPORT AS MUCH AS A

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.066
HUNDRED AND SIXTY DUMP TRUCKS.

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.534
OF MATERIAL FROM THEIR PROPERTY.

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.870
AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS CLEARING

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.104

ANY SETTLEMENT THEY'VE BEEN

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.044
ABLE TO SECURE.

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:17.379
FROM THEIR INSURERS.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.748
WHEN YOU FIGURE THAT PER CUBIC

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.550
YARD WE'RE LOOKING AT DISPOSAL

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:23.619

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE IN THE.

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:32.227
AND THE MARKET FOR DISPOSAL.

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.862
PLUS LABOR TO HANDLE THIS

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.498
MATERIAL YOU CAN SEE WHY DEBRIS

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:37.599
CLEARING HAS BEEN SUCH A HEAVY

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:38.800
EXPENSE FOR.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.969
THESE HOMEOWNERS.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.204
ONE THING I WILL APPLAUD

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.606
INSURERS FOR IS THE DECISION TO

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:45.007
COVER THESE COSTS.

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:45.974
.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.176
OVER AND ABOVE WHAT IS

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.878
TRADITIONALLY THE DEBRIS.

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.114

MOST HOMEOWNERS POLICIES

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.052
HOWEVER.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:58.720
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.122
THE AGGREGATE A LIMIT ON THE

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.891

AGAIN OPERATIONS ON SITE HAVE

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:24.179
COME TO SOMEONE OF A PAUSE WHILE

AFTER RECONSTRUCTION.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.089
THERE'S BEEN.

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:36.224
LARGE DISPARITY INSURERS

WAS SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITION

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.501
WITH REGARD TO SCOPE OF WORK.

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.903
THE COST THEREOF.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.271
BUT MANY HAVE NOT.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.739
.

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:51.873
JUST TALK ABOUT THE WAY THE

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.575
DEBRIS REMOVAL COSTS CAN A ROAD.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:54.643
THE RECONSTRUCTION BUDGET.

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.944
.

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:58.080
SOME EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF.

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.282
THINGS WHERE ALLEN CONSTRUCTION

.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.346

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:41.990
OVER CALIFORNIA.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:43.959
ESPECIALLY FOR US AND THE

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:45.694
LENGTH OF THE WORK FLOW.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.095
WITH SOME OF THE CARRIERS THAT

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.063
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.032

THEIR ARMS AROUND SOME NOVEL

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:09.651
PROBLEMS.

.

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:12.988
ANIMOSITY MIGHT FLORA CHALLENGE

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.089
FOR US BUT ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.357
ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE

THE.

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:24.199
THE WORKFLOWS THAT HAVE EMERGED.

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:26.268
.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.336
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PRIMARY

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:29.805
CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.441
WORKING WHO NOW WITH OUR WITH

OUR PUBLIC COUNTERPARTS IS.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:34.810
.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.279
THE REMAPPING OF MODESTY THOUGH

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.246
AND THE MONEY AND THE.

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:39.614
THOUGHT THINGS THERE AND.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:41.316
AS.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.219
AS WAS EARLIER STATED OF THE

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:46.021
HYDROLOGY OF THE REGION HAS BEEN

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.556
CHANGED BY THE DEBRIS FLOW. AND

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:49.124
SO THE FLOODPLAIN IS NO LONGER

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.092
RATE USED TO BE.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:51.526
NOBODY'S QUITE SURE WHAT THE

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.095
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AS BUT THAT.

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:54.663
THAT MAP INFORMATION IS

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.331
FORTHCOMING THE NET EFFECT OF

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.100
THAT IS THAT SOME OF OUR CLIENTS

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.301
MAY BE.

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.635
AT LEAST AT RISK.

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:02.704
TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE TO

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:03.805
RAISE THEIR HOMES UP OUT OF THE

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.140
FLOOD PLAIN.

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:07.309
UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE HOMES

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.277
AREN'T GENERALLY A TOTAL LOSS

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.780
THE DIFFERENCE IN COST BETWEEN.

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.682
RAISING THE HOME WHICH CAN

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:14.483
WHICH CAN BE.

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.351
EITHER NEARLY ORG REALLY

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.553
COMPLETELY A REBUILD OF THE HOME.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.322
VERSUS JUST BUILDING BACK IN

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:22.257
KIND ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:23.592
THERE IS SUCH INTENSE COST

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:25.160
PRESSURE ON THESE PROJECTS THAT

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:26.394
MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.596
DIRECTING US.

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:30.065
TO HELP THEM TRY TO SKIRT.

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:32.767
THIS RULER TO BASICALLY ON.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.237
NOT TRIGGER THE THRESHOLD RULE

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:36.605
THE FIFTY THE SO CALLED FIFTY

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:36.938
PERCENT RULE.

01:19:37.005 --> 01:19:38.874
.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.774
THAT WOULD INCUR THE

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.143
REQUIREMENT TO ACTUALLY RAISE

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.644
THE HOME UP OUT OF THE ABOUT OF

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:47.015
THE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:48.283
WITH RECONSTRUCTION AHEAD OF US

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.384
I THINK THE SILVER LINING OF

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.452
COURSE IS.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.687
IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:53.155
BACK BETTER.

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.056
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF I THINK

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.458
REALLY POSITIVE IDEAS AROUND

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.559
FUTURE RESILIENCE.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.927
FOR EXAMPLE REINFORCED WALL

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.529
SECTIONS.

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.863
AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.298
POSSIBILITY OF ELEVATING THE

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:04.499
HOMES AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.901
STRATEGIES THERE SUCH AS PI LONG

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.569
FOUNDATIONS OR REYES FOUNDATIONS

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.304
WITH BREAKAWAY WALLS SO THAT

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:10.839
MUCH CAN ACTUALLY FLOW UNDER THE

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.040
HOUSE WITHOUT IMPACTING THE

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.308
LIVING SPACE.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.443
WITH RELATIVELY MINOR DAMAGE TO

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.610
THE.

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.045
TO THE BUILDING.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:20.148
FOR HOMES THAT ARE ARE.

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:22.584
NEARLY COMPLETE OR COMPLETELY

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.251
ALLOWS.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.086
RELOCATING THE HOME ON THE

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.321
PROPERTY IS ALSO POTENTIALLY AN

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:27.856
OPTION.

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.225
AND I I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LET

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.426
THE OPPORTUNITY PASS TO TALK

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.361
ABOUT THE A CHANCE THAT WE HAVE

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.196
TO BUILD BACK.

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.398
.

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:38.967
TO HIRE SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.402
OR EVEN THAT ZERO ENERGY.

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:42.671
WE DON'T GET THAT MANY

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.105
OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE LIFETIME

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:45.774
OF A TYPICAL BUILDING TO WORK

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.741
INSIDE OF THE WALLS ARE WORK

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.310
INSIDE THE ROOF THE YOU KNOW THE

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:49.811
VARIOUS BUILDING ASSEMBLIES AND.

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.379
WHEN WE DO WE CAN REALLY HAVE A

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.447
HUGE IMPACT ON THE ENERGY

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.049
EFFICIENCY OF THAT BUILDING

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.083
ENCLOSURE.

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.484
AND AND SO THIS IS A RARE

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:57.552
OPPORTUNITY.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.287
WITH ALL THAT SAID I THINK AGAIN

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.422
BE INTENSE COST PRESSURE ON

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.089
THESE.

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:01.356
PROJECTS.

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.024
.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:05.827
LEADS ME TO LIMITED OPTIMISM

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:06.761
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:07.762
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THESE.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:09.397
.

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.299
OF ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.968
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:17.372
SUPPORT PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS.

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:18.640
LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A FINAL

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:18.907
THOUGHT.

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:21.576
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:23.645
CLEAR MY HEAD FROM ACROSS SPACE.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:24.579
ON YOUR BELLY.

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:26.581
IT'S INTENSELY DANGEROUS.

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:29.851
VERY DIRTY FILTHY WET.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.653
PHYSICAL WORK

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:31.820
AND.

01:21:31.886 --> 01:21:34.389
.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.557
THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WORKING AT

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.858
OUR CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN DOING

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:37.392
THIS.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.960
FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS ON END WITH

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.428
A SMILE ON THEIR FACE.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:41.630
IN ORDER TO REBUILD THEIR

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.064
COMMUNITIES IN THIS IS THIS IS

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:44.366
THE REAL HEROISM.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:46.434
OF THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT.

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:47.602
AT THIS POINT I AM VERY PROUD

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.337
OF THESE GUYS.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:50.438
THESE MEN WITH IT FOR DOING

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.307
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.676
INTO FAT I'LL LE. ALL UP INTO

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.911
QUESTIONS AS WELL THANK YOU.

WERE DEATHLY HEARING THEMES. AND

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:03.918
THAT HAVE COME UP.

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.920
FOR BOTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:07.822
AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.424
CENTRAL COAST AND.

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:13.428
AB BUT ALSO THEMES THAT ARE BY.

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:14.929
THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF JUST

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.798
REGION BUT ALSO THE KIND OF

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:18.400
WHERE WE'RE AT THE TIMELY IN THE

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:20.035
RECOVERY PROCESS.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.537
SO I APPRECIATE THAT MEMBERS

AS A MEMBER WALDRON.

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.342
.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:30.278
MY AREA HAD THE LILAC FIRE.

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:32.414
WHICH WASN'T TO THE SCALE

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.648
OBVIOUSLY THAT WE SAW HERE BUT.

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.717
SAN DIEGO BACK WHEN I SERVED IN

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.352
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE HAD THE

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:39.854
CEDAR FIRE. WHICH HAD TWO

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.523
HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:43.058
ALMOST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.393
THOUSAND ACRES BURN WITH. TWENTY

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.162
EIGHT HUNDRED STRUCTURES

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.697
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT HIT

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:50.131
WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.933
AND THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH THE

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.702
WHICH FIRED IN THE CREEK FIRE.

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:54.569
WHICH HAD ANOTHER.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.705
HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:22:56.771 --> 01:23:01.576
ACRES SO WHEN WE LIVED THROUGH

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.111
WE LEARNED A LOT WE LEARNED A

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:04.946
LOT BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD THE

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.114
LILAC FIRE THIS TIME IT WAS

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.550
NIGHT AND DAY. FROM WHAT IT HAD

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:10.785
BEEN AS FAR AS COMMUNICATIONS

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:11.986
JUSTLY INTERAGENCY

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.488
COMMUNICATIONS WAS SO MUCH MORE

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:14.122
ADVANCED.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.257
.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.826
YOU KNOW I'M I WAS SPUR GETTING

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.494
DAILY UPDATES AND SPEAKING WITH

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.262
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OFFICE

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:23.198
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WE HAD.

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:25.633
YOU CAL FIRE DIDAN AWESOME JOB

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.335
A LOCAL FIRE DISTRICTS THE

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:30.105
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS MUTUAL AID

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:30.405
ALL OF THAT.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.740
.

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.007
SOME OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.976
THOUGH WAS IT'S NOT ONLY JUST

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.745
THE HOMES THAT ACTUALLY BURN

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.713
THAT ARE IMPACTED BECAUSE. WITH

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.416
THE CEDAR FIRE. AND MAYBE IT WAS

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.951
EVEN THE WHICH FIRE WAS WORSE.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:45.186
THE AMOUNT OF ASH THAT FELL AND

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:47.722
I DON'T KNOW HOW LOOK WAS YOU

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:49.424
KNOW AS FAR AS WITH THE BUT IT

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.292
FOR A WEEK THE GROUND WAS

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.428
COVERED WITH WHITE ASH AND THEN

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:54.996
WHEN YOU GET THE RAIN. PEOPLE'S

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.265
HOMES WERE MILES FROM THE FIRE.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.200
ACTUALLY HAD THE CARP IS

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:02.070
DESTROYED ON YOU THE AIR QUALITY

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:05.073
IMPACTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH WE HAD.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.409
YOU KNOW LOSS OF.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.777
KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL JUST

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.845
EVERYTHING COLLAPSED.

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:11.045
AND.

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.815
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU I GUESS MY

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.250
QUESTION FOR YOU IS THE BUT ONE

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.018
OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE SAW AS

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.153
AN IMPROVEMENT. WAS THE

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:20.288
COMMUNICATIONS HOW DID WE GET

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.223
ALERTS OUT TO PEOPLE WHERE THE

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.192
FIRE IS GOING BACILLI LA FIRE

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:28.296
JUST WITH. VERY QUICKLY ON.

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.498
AND THEN AFTERWARDS IN RECOVERY

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.733
HOW DO WE GET INFORMATION OUT TO

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.234
PEOPLE.

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.969
WHERE THEY CAN GO TO AXIS THING

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.071
WHAT'S AVAILABLE I MEAN WE HAD

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.774
SOME COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND I

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.309
KNOW DOCTOR WOODS OFFICES BUT

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.044
ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY WERE

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:44.979
AHEAD OF US? YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.848
GOING ON IN SANTA ROSA THAT WE

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.316
COULD THEN PREPARE FOR IN

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:49.984
ADVANCE.

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:52.020
TOM YOU'RE HURT WHAT'S THE BEST

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.588
METHODS THAT YOU FOUND TO

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:54.856
COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.891
YOU KNOW.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.493
WHAT'S AVAILABLE HOW CAN THEY

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.094
GET THE DEBRIS REMOVAL WHAT YOU

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:00.829
KNOW.

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:04.265
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:06.334
TYPE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:08.269
THAT WE'VE REALLY FIGURED OUT IS

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:09.771
WHERE OUR LIMITATIONS ARE ON

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:11.806
COMMUNICATION. IS OBVIOUSLY WE

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:13.408
HAVE BEEN HAVING A BIG

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:13.942
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ALERT

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:16.044
SYSTEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.812
THAT IN CINEMA COUNTY.

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.547
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE I THINK

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:21.082
MANY OF US LEARNED ABOUT THE

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.817
LACK OF REDUNDANCY FOR INTERNET

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:24.786
AND CELLPHONES IN AREAS OF OUR

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.788
CITY THAT MAYBE. SOMEWHERE NOT

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:28.823
AS AWARE OF AND THE FLOW OF

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.725
INFORMATION WAS SLOW AS A RESULT

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.194
OF THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON.

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:34.329
PICKING THAT UP AND TRYING TO

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.064
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:37.799
ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT I'D

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.834
BE CRITICAL OF THE RESPONSE THAT

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.936
WE'VE SEEN IS YOU WOULD THINK

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.304
THAT HAVING GONE THROUGH

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:45.240
MULTIPLE FIRES THROUGH. MUD

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.808
SLIDES THAT THERE WOULD BE A

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.109
LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION IN

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:49.744
TERMS OF ONE PAGERS THAT WE

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.312
COULD PUT OUT TO THE PUBLIC. FOR

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:52.347
THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.315
PROCESS LOOKS LIKE PARTICULARLY

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:56.050
FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL AND.

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:57.352
THAT WASN'T THERE AND WASN'T

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:59.087
AVAILABLE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.122
WE HAVE IT NOW WE HAVE WEBSITES

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.857
UP AND WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:03.892
GOT MUCH BETTER ABOUT PUSHING

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:07.462
INFORMATION. TO OUR NEIGHBORS.

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:09.264
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.966
DON'T LEAVE HERE. TALKING ABOUT

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:13.401
OUR ALERT SYSTEM WITHOUT. ALSO

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:15.370
MENTIONING HOW INCREDIBLE IT WAS

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.704
NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.840
THROUGHOUT THE FIRE THAT THAT

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:21.576
WAS OUR ALERT SYSTEM. AND IT'S

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:23.344
BOTH A FAILURE FROM A GOVERNMENT

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.913
PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO A SUCCESS

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.881
FROM A COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE AND

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:29.751
NOT TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:30.351
INVEST IN THOSE STRUCTURES AS

01:26:30.418 --> 01:26:32.520
WELL.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:33.655
EIGHTY HAVE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:34.389
POINT.

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:36.524
MISS WALDRON IS.

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.225
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THAT.

01:26:37.292 --> 01:26:40.628
SIGN.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.964
IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO. MEASURE

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.899
THE EFFECTIVENESS BUT I ALSO

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.401
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FACT

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:47.769
THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT PAY

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:49.337
ATTENTION TO THEIR CELLPHONES OR

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:51.372
HOW THEM OFF AT NIGHT. OR MAY

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:53.908
NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT'S.

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:54.842
BUT NO THIS LARGE MIGHT BE IN

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.578
THAT IN FACT.

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.379
YOU KNOW WITH THE LACK OF SIRENS

01:26:58.446 --> 01:26:59.480
WERE YOU KNOW WE OF SOME FLOOD

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:00.181
SIRENS WHERE I LIVE BUT.

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:01.616
.

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:02.784
THAT THAT NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.119
CONTACT WAS THAT VOICE OF

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.555
URGENCY THAT THIS IS REAL AND

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:09.090
YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO GET UP OUT

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.458
OF YOUR COMFORTABLE HOME.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.961
BECAUSE DANGER IS IMMINENT.

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:15.096
WHEREAS YOU KNOW WE KIND OF GET

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:16.130
THESE ALERTS SOMETIMES AND IT'S

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.999
A BIT MORE PASSIVE.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.602
AND DATA AND THAT THAT ALONE.

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.036
DID YOU KNOW THE FUTURE WOULDN'T

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:23.371
GIVE PEOPLE THAT THAT SAME SENSE

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:25.173
OF URGENCY NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:27.241
RIGHT ANYTHING THAT YOU DO EVEN

01:27:27.308 --> 01:27:28.876
ON THE ALERT SIZE IF IT'S A

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.445
SIREN. YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE A

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:32.313
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AROUND WHAT

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.115
THOSE SIRENS MEAN JUST SENDING

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.683
OFF AN ALARM WITHOUT THE PUBLIC

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:36.618
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY'RE

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:38.586
INTENDED TO DO WHERE THEY CAN GO

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.588
AND FIND MORE INFORMATION. WOULD

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.856
CREATE PANIC IF YOU HAVEN'T

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:43.825
PREPARED THE COMMUNITY ON HOW TO

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:45.526
RESPOND TO THAT SIREN SO I THINK

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:46.527
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:47.562
ABOUT IT FROM TWO DIFFERENT

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:49.364
ANGLES. ONE IS ON THE TECHNOLOGY

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:51.299
SIDE BUT THEM ONE IS STILL

01:27:51.366 --> 01:27:51.899
HIGHLIGHTING ON THE COMMUNITY

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.167
SIDE.

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:55.036
SOME JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ARM

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.704
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ISSUE ONE

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:57.705
OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.140
ENCOUNTERED AFTER THOSE BIG

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:00.575
FIRES IN THE MID.

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:01.876
A TWO THOUSANDS WAS.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.645
YOU KNOW.

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:04.145
PEOPLE THEN COULDN'T GET

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:05.380
INSURANCE

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.714
I MEAN I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.449
WE COULD NOT GET INSURANCE I WAS

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.451
ON THE FAIR PLAN AND MY WAY SAID

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:11.819
THE FAIR PLAYING ISN'T FAIR.

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:14.622
BECAUSE. THE AVERAGE COST IS

01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:16.658
MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT THE MARKET

01:28:16.724 --> 01:28:18.926
RATE WOULD BE FOR A HOME AND IF

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.395
YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE THEN.

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.896
PEOPLE WILL WALKING AWAY FROM

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.931
THEIR HOMES. SO HOW DO WE.

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:25.800
THAT

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:26.768
YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:27.969
GUESS WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:29.771
WORK ON BECAUSE.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:32.140
YOU KNOW THEY SAY HI FIRE RISK

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:34.776
AREAS NOW THERE. MY DISTRICT IS

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:35.843
IN YOUR ALL YOUR DISTRICTS WILL

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.512
BE IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY.

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.447
I'M GONNA HAVE.

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:40.848
WHEN NEW HOMES BUILT ON MORAL

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.316
ENCOURAGING YOU KNOW

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.152
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND BUILDING.

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:45.653
HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET INSURED

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:48.089
AND THE FAIR PLAN REALLY IS

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.324
VERY DIFFICULT FOR? HAS NO

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.759
AFFORDABILITY THERE AND IT'S

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.394
JUST BASIC.

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:55.029
COVERAGE IT REALLY DOESN'T COVER

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.031
MUCH SO. I JUST WANTED TO KIND

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.132
OF PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE

01:28:58.199 --> 01:28:59.834
COMMITTEE.

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.169
IF IF I MAY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:02.203
WRITTEN AND BLOOMBERG THAT

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.937
TALKED ABOUT.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.006
IT WAS CHALLENGING US IN SAYING

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.774
ARE WE SUBSIDIZING PEOPLE A

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.342
REPAIRMAN FILE UP FIRE AREAS.

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.477
RIGHT NOW IT'S WHAT WE ALL HAVE

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:11.512
TO LOOK OUT FOR IS IS AS WE DO

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.513
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WANT

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.648
AFFORDABILITY BUT AT THE SAME

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:15.416
TIME. IF SOMEBODY THINKS THAT IN

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:16.651
THE FUTURE THEY CAN LIVE IN A

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.453
FIRE AREA AND HAVE LOK LOW

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.288
INSURANCE COVERAGE AND HAVE

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.056
GREAT RESULTS IT'S NOT THERE. IF

YOU LOOK IN KEY WEST I HAD A

01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:23.891
CHANCE.

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.793
TO GOT TO KEY WEST IMPORTER

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.228
RICO'S APART A DISASTER TOURS

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:29.163
KEEP FOLKS IN KEY WEST PAY MORE

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:29.564

INSURANCE THEY DO ON THEIR

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:31.733
MORTGAGE

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:34.068
RIGHT. ARE NOT NOT KEY WEST THE

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:36.037
KEYS RIGHT NOW HAVE A A VARIETY

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.205
OF DIFFERENT INSURANCE THAT

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:39.040
BUNDLE AROUND IT AND. IN THAT IF

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.742
YOU LOOK ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:41.542

01:29:43.244 --> 01:29:44.412
HAPPENING IS INSURANCE COMPANIES

THOUGH THEY'RE BEHIND ON

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:06.320
RESOURCES.

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:07.021
AND I THINK WE NEED THE YOU KNOW

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:07.655
AS A PART OF OUR WORK WITH CAL

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:08.322
FIRE AND OTHERS. IS WE NEED TO

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:08.990
FIGURE OUT THIS WORLD OF I WOULD

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:09.924
ASK YOU ALL TO HELP US.

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.592
IT IS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.727
IT'S HELPING US WITH THE PERMITS

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.395
ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

01:32:14.462 --> 01:32:16.931
WHETHER IT BACH MED. OR NORTHERN

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:17.932
POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:20.268
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF GHGS FROM

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:21.736
LIKE WHEN.

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:24.839
GRACE BENNETT AND JUDY. MORRIS

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:26.540
FROM TRINITY AND SISKIYOU EVEN

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.276
KICK STATE OF JEFFERSON FOLKS

01:32:28.342 --> 01:32:29.343
ARE LIKE WE DON'T EVEN AGREE

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.245
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE EXISTS BUT

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.014
WE DO AGREE THAT IN THESE MOST

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.982
RECENT RASH OF FIRES. WE

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:37.084
RELEASED BOARD GHGS INTO THE

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.153
ATMOSPHERE THAT WE COULD OF OVER

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:41.055
OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS.

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:42.223
SO THINGS LIKE THAT MEAN WE

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.257
DON'T WANT SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS

01:32:43.324 --> 01:32:44.959
THAT SCARE US.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.761
YOU OR SCARE YOU ALL BUT STUFF

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:47.828
LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN DO GOOD

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:51.232
IS DESPERATELY NEED.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:52.934
AND HERE I THINK TO ALL OF YOUR

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.236
POINTS AND YOU YOU EACH TALK

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:57.872
ABOUT SCALING UP RIGHT AND.

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.508
OR IN SOME WAY ABOUT WE'VE SEEN

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.410
THIS IS THIS ISN'T JUST ONE CITY

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:04.612
ONE COUNTY THIS IS MUCH BIGGER

01:33:04.679 --> 01:33:06.380
AND WERE ALL RUNNING ACROSS THE

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:09.483
SAME THEMES. ANTS AT SOME OF

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:10.618
WHAT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON IS

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.620
REFLECTED IN THIS HANDOUT THAT

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.888
WAS GIVEN WITH.

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:16.090
FORTY BILLS US SORRY FORTY FOUR

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:18.225
AND COUNTING. FLAT A FORTY FOUR

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:20.227
BILLS IN ACCOUNTING. AND THAT

01:33:20.294 --> 01:33:21.996
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED I THINK

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.798
THAT THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED ON IN

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:26.033
TERMS OF IMPACTING SOME OF THESE

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.435
AREAS WHETHER YOU DESCRIBE THE

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:28.869
INSURANCE.

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:30.805
THE DEBRIS REMOVAL WHICH HAS

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:33.107
BECOME AN EVERYDAY WORD FOR ALL

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:35.609
OR TERM FOR ALL OF US AND.

01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:38.646
I. MANAGEMENT PLAN STATEWIDE

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.982
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IMPACT

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:41.983
TO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE TRADE

01:33:42.049 --> 01:33:43.751
OFFS I THINK ALL OF THAT IS

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.486
REFLECTED IN AND IN MOST OF

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:48.356
THESE BILLS. UP BUT YOU DO

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:50.024
EMPHASIZE THE POINT OVER AND

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.326
OVER THAT AT THIS ISN'T JUST

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.661
APPLYING TO ONE AREA THAT THIS

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:56.530
IS BROADER I'M I WAS STRUCK BY.

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:57.898
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WATERSHED

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.166
MARINES.

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.168
THAT AND THE FACT THAT.

01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:04.205
DOT IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AREAS

01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:05.673
WHERE I THINK ALL OF OUR

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.607
COMMUNITIES COULD HAVE DONE

01:34:06.674 --> 01:34:08.376
BETTER I KNOW THAT I RECEIVED

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.011
CALLS FROM NAG.

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:12.146
SAYING WE WANT REALLY BASIC

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:13.681
THINGS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO TO

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.649
GO TO SOMEONE SAYS IT'S.

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:17.651
THE.

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:19.020
YEAH CAN YOU KNOW THAT RESOURCE

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.388
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS OTHER

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.523
FOLKS A KNOW ITS FEMALE AND NO

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:25.359
IT'S THE COUNTY AND AND. WHAT

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:26.727
ARE THE STATE WE WERE GOING BACK

01:34:26.794 --> 01:34:28.095
AND FORTH BUT I THINK YOU'VE

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:29.797
RAISED THE IDEA THAT REALLY WE

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.599
DO HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:32.400
ABOUT?

01:34:32.466 --> 01:34:34.935
THE SCALE OF THIS AND WHO TO GO

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:35.803
TO.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.339
AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT ENTITY BUT

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:39.106
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THERE

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.042
WERE. I MEAN WITH THE LIST CAN

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:44.278
GO ON A ON WHETHER IT'S AN ALARM

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.747
SYSTEM OUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.015
WATERSHEDS.

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:49.984
CON I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.552
ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.454
CONTRACTING AND EVERYONE'S

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:54.855
TALKED ABOUT INSURANCE.

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:55.956
IN THIS.

01:34:56.023 --> 01:34:57.691
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.160
THERE'S THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:00.694
DONE BUT I I HOPE THAT IN THESE

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.997
FORTY FOUR BILLS AND COUNTING.

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:05.833
ON THE IS THAT SOME OF THAT IS

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:06.367
REFLECTED IN IN THIS.

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.271
AS I'M A WOOD. YET THEN THESE

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.439
ARE KIND OF A.

01:35:11.505 --> 01:35:12.573
THE DIVERSION FROM SOME WERE

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:13.374
TALKING ABOUT BUT I'M I'M

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:14.742
THINKING SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:17.211
HERE AS FAR AS WHAT SOME OF THE

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:19.280
MORE LONG TERM EFFECTS AS WELL

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:19.780
AND THAT'S.

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.515
I COME WITH YOU KNOW FROM BOTH

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:22.750
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IN AND THEN

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:25.219
SNOW COUNTY. THAT THE THE NUMBER

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.554
OF HOMES

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.355
THAT ARE OR ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:29.890
LEFT THE AREA.

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:31.392
AND HOW MANY ARE HOW MANY WE

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.127
LOST.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:34.662
AND THEN AND THEN ALSO.

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.431
IF SOMEONE CAN SUCH ON THE WHAT

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.433
WHAT WHAT I'M WILL ALL REFER TO

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.634
AS SORT OF THE SECONDARILY

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:42.436
DISPLACED FOLKS THE FOLKS THAT.

01:35:42.503 --> 01:35:44.572
JUST.

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:47.408
GOT BOOTED OUT QUITE FRANKLY.

01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:48.843
WHAT SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ARE

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.611
IMPACT IS LARGE OBVIOUSLY AS

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.613
CINEMA BUT LIKE I SAID OVER?

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.381
FIVE HUNDRED WHERE I AM DAMJAN

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:55.716
ASTRIDE NAY THINK EHRLICH TWO

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:56.951
HUNDRED FIFTEEN WERE RED TAGGED

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:58.986
AND SO YOU SEE SOME OF THAT

01:35:59.053 --> 01:35:59.620
STILL UP THERE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:35:59.687 --> 01:35:59.920
MOVED BACK.

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.322
AND.

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.290
IN THIS AREA WE THE PEOPLE OF

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:06.227
CHOICES.

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:08.095
AND SO THE WORRY THAT WE HAVE IS

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:08.729
NOT GOING TO WANT TO MOVE BACK

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:09.897
AND IF THEY DON'T TO GO THROUGH

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:10.264
THE ISSUES THAT.

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.532
.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:12.533
I JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT SO THAT

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.134
OTHER WORRY AND SO TRYING TO

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:13.767
KEEP THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:14.902
ENGAGED.

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:15.903
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.138
COME TO COMMUNITY MEETINGS I

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.873
KNOW I WANT TO REBUILD. I WANT

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.841
TO STAY HERE AND SO IT'S REALLY

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:22.510
DEPENDING IT'S TRYING TO

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:23.677
CONTINUE TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:25.212
ENGAGED ON THE SECONDARY.

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.414
ISSUES WE ARE EXPERIENCE ARE

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:29.016
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:29.683
WE HAVE.

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:32.720
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WORKS.

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:35.122
DISTRICTS STRUGGLING TO RENTING

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:36.490
COURSE SERVING THAT COMMUNITY

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:37.691
AND SO THEY'VE BEEN DISPLACED IN

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:38.425
THEIR JOBS.

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.661
.

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:41.595
PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S JUST A

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.497
VERY SHE SHE AREA IT IS BUT

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:44.565
THERE'S A LOT OF SERVICE WORKERS

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.167
AS WELL AND SO WE'RE SEEING A

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:47.668
LOT INCOME THROUGH OUR RECOVERY

01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:49.403
CENTER. I'M LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.005
ASSISTANCE.

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:52.439
AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE A

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:53.807
STRUGGLE FOR US WE'VE ALL THE

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.609
SBA LOANS AND ALL THE FEMA

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:57.144
INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE ALL OF

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:59.013
THAT HAS OCCURRED. WE HAD.

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.681
R. BLATTNER PHILANTHROPIC

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.316
COMMUNITY GIVEN MONEY TO OUR

01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:03.984
UNITED WAY AND THEY'RE RELEASING

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.419
THAT MONEY IN THAT PURE

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.353
DISCLOSED PRESS AGAINST WE'VE

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.689
DONE ANOTHER SURGE OF TRYING TO

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.391
APPLICATIONS OUT. BUT IT IS A

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.092
STRUGGLE.

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:14.328
THE ON THE NUMBER SIDE IS TWO

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:15.729
THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW WERE

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:17.932
FORCED TO KIND OF USE MACRO

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:19.366
NUMBERS TO TRYING TO ESTIMATE

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.368
TOO OFTEN. LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.003
FACT THAT ONLY TWENTY NINE

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.504
PERCENT OF RENTERS HAVE

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:25.806
UNTIL ENSURE.

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:27.508
IN THE CINEMA COUNTY MODEL AND

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:28.175
SO.

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:30.311
SECONDLY IS THE FACT THAT IN

01:37:30.377 --> 01:37:31.912
BOTH IN IN IN THROUGHOUT THE

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.847
ENTIRE AREA THIRTY NINE PERCENT

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:35.616
OF THE ENTIRE HOMES LOST FIFTY

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.618
THREE HUNDRED. WERE.

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.620
WERE RENTERS AS WELL RIGHT SO

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.322
THE RENTERS AS IT WAS DESCRIBED

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:42.423
TO US BY SOME OF THE FEMALE

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:43.624
HOUSING FOLKS. IT'S VERY HARD TO

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.925
TRACK THEM

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.660
BECAUSE THEY KIND OF PEOPLE WHO

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:47.461
THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:48.762
LIKE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:50.598
RENTERS THEY ARE FULL TIME HOME

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:52.600
RENTERS RIGHT. SO THEY KIND OF

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.468
MOVE AND I MEAN IT WAS FUNNY TO

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:56.070
HEAR ME EVEN TALK ABOUT OF THE

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.538
FEMA HOUSING SPECIALIST.

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.173
A ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY IS

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.507
THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO YOU

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.576
ALL IS. WERE WORKING WITH ONE OF

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:03.911
THE FOUNDATIONS AND CINEMA

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:06.213
COUNTY RIGHT NOW TO DO PRETTY

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.848
VERY EXPENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:09.750
STUDY TO TRACK THAT SO IT CAN

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.285
AND FORMER DECISION MAKING. THIS

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:12.720
IS NOT THE TIPPING POINT ONE BUT

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:14.655
IT'S SIMILAR TO THAT THAT THEY

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:15.723
WOULD ACTUALLY BRING IN A

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:16.724
RESEARCH GROUP THAT TO TRY AND

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.792
HELP US. WITH LIKE TO BEGIN NO

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.527
ON TIME DECISION MAKING THAT

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:21.295
THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:23.030
LEAVING BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:25.299
IS. ONLY AS ONLY ANECDOTAL ONCE

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:26.867
AGAIN BUT PERSONALLY I'VE HAD AT

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:28.402
LEAST FIFTEEN PEOPLE CONTACT MY

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:29.603
OFFICE.

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:30.604
WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOW

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:31.705
NUMBER BUT LET'S SAY ONE OUT OF

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.073
EVERY.

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.109
FIFTY OR A HUNDRED DECIDES TO

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:36.977
CONTACT A GOVERNMENT OFFICE

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:38.512
TO SAY I'VE BEEN I'VE HAD TO

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:40.447
MOVE OUT OF MY HOME BECAUSE

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.815
EITHER THE LANDLORDS WHO LOST

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:43.651
HER HOME MOVED BACK. OR THE

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:45.085
INSURANCE HERE'S THE THING

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.620
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE INSURANCE

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:48.255
COMPANIES ARE PAYING IN BETWEEN

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:50.624
SIX AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.660
A MONTH TO HOUSE PEOPLE.

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:53.260
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT PAYING

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.928
PEOPLE BACK.

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.697
AT A HIGH LEVEL FOR REBUILD THEY

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.165
SEE THEY HAVE A HUGE LIABILITY

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.333
IF THEY DON'T FIND YOU HOUSING

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:00.401
LOCALLY.

01:39:00.467 --> 01:39:02.202
SO THE PAIN NOT MUCH IN ITS

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:04.171
FORCING THIS OUT AND SO WE HAD A

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:05.773
WOMAN WHO WAS A. IT WAS AT THE

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:07.374
CATTLEMEN'S

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:08.642
WHAT IS A HOSTESS AT THE

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:09.843
CATTLEMEN'S WHO GLENN JULY TO

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:11.011
GOD REST HIS SOUL CALLS ME UP

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.379
AND SAYS. A MATTER THE OTHER

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.048
NIGHT SHE'S THE HOSTESS THERE

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.616
AND SHE CAN AFFORD. PROBABLY

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:17.384
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH.

01:39:17.451 --> 01:39:18.719
SLEEP IN HER CAR IN FRONT OF A

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:21.155
QUE WAY RIGHT. I KNOW THAT'S

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.023
ANECDOTAL BUT IT IS HAPPENING.

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.190
SO.

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:26.527
.

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.262
LEARNED SO MUCH BUT THE QUESTION

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:30.164
IS HOW DO WE WORK WITH YOU GUYS

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:31.031
TO SPREAD THIS THROUGHOUT THE

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:33.000
STATE. A FINAL THING IS WHEN WE

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.668
MET TO REVIEW OUR INDEPENDENT

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:35.669
ASSESSMENT DONE BY.

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.471
YES ON OUR.

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:39.239
ON OUR LEARNING SYSTEM.

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:41.709
BY DIRECTOR KILLER DUDE SHE AND

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.344
TWO OF HIS OTHER FOLKS SAID THEY

01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.912
SAID YOU GOTTA REALIZE THAT WE

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:46.080
DID A STATEWIDE SURVEY AND I

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.181
NEVER HEARD OF THIS AND

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:48.515
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ABOUT

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.284
PREPAREDNESS. AND LIKE MORE THAN

01:39:50.351 --> 01:39:51.618
FIFTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.120
DON'T DON'T EVEN REACH THE FIRST

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.788
ROUND OF PREPAREDNESS WHICH IS

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:55.956
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S RISK

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:57.524
IN THEIR LIVES. YOU KNOW SO THEY

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:58.492
SAID THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO

01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:01.628
KIND OF SAY NOBODY'S PREPARED

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:02.229
FOR THIS AND YET WE'RE IN THE

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:02.830
NEW NORMAL.

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.565
AND SO NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WITH

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:07.000
WIRELESS ALERTS AND OTHER THINGS.

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:09.870
WE GOT TO GET BACK TO BASICS SO

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.705
ON HELP US HELP YOU FIGURE THAT

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:13.640
OUT. FED THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.376
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:16.877
THE QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S ONE

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:17.978
OF THE PARTS OF. THIS

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.546
CONVERSATION THAT TENDS TO GET

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:21.315
LOST FROM THE CITY AND FROM THE

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.716
COUNTY PERSPECTIVE IS WERE

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.184
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.487
ON HOW TO HELP THE FOLKS THAT

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:27.921
LOST THEIR HOMES. AND NOT.

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.523
AND NOT ENOUGH TIME TALKING

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:30.924
ABOUT THE MACRO EFFECTS THAT'S

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:32.893
HAVING IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'VE

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.795
DONE A SURVEY BY THE OR THE

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.196
UNITED POLICY HOLDERS HAVE DONE

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.564
A SURVEY THAT SHOWED ABOUT TWO

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:38.665
THIRDS OF THE FOLKS THAT LOST

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:41.068
THEIR HOMES. IN THE FIRE.

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.504
WERE UNDER INSURED BY HUNDREDS

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:44.037
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:45.305
AVERAGE.

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:47.408
AND WE EXPECT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:50.144
A THIRD TO A HALF TO NOT REBUILD.

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:51.545
THERE ARE MANY HAVE MOVED

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:53.046
THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY.

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:55.015
MANY HAVE LEFT AND I KNOW OUR

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:55.849
SCHOOL BOARD IS A LITTLE BIT

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.251
TERRIFIED THAT WHEN THE SCHOOL

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:59.186
YEAR IS OVER AND THE KIDS ARE NO

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.220
LONGER HOLDING THE FAMILIES

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.955
THERE THAT THAT'S WHEN WE'LL SEE

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:03.624
DISPLACEMENT AS WELL. BUT OVER

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.058
ALSO SAYING IS FOR

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:06.427
BECAUSE WE IN SANTA ROSA HAVE

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:07.961
LESS THAN A ONE PERCENT VACANCY

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:09.930
RATE FOR RENTERS. RANCHERS ARE

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.666
BEING DISPLACED BY FOLKS WHO

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:14.535
INSURANCE WILL PAY MORE FOR.

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:15.969
AND OTHERS WHO WERE LIVING ON

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:18.338
THE MARGINS A RIGHT BETWEEN

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:19.973
BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A PLACE TO

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:20.808
LIVE IN BEING LIVING IN THEIR

01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:22.743
CAR ARE ALSO BEING PUSHED

01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:24.178
FURTHER OUT AND SO WE'VE SEEN

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:26.213
RANCHERS DISPLACED WE'VE SEEN. A

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.482
MORE OF A HOMELESS BOOM AND

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:30.350
SANTA ROSA IN PARTICULAR THAT WE

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:32.019
HAD BEFORE THESE WERE ISSUES

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.554
THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH. AND

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.988
THEN JUST SORT ABOUT THE LAST

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.590
NOTED THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINT

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.425
ABOUT US ALL TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:40.360
AS A REGIONAL ISSUE I SERVE ON

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.595
THE MAYORS AND COUNCIL MEMBERS

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:43.430
LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE. ONE

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:44.631
REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH CITY IN

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:46.099
THE COUNTY AND WE DON'T MEET AT

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.901
ALL ANYMORE WITHOUT ME HEARING

01:41:47.968 --> 01:41:49.903
FROM THOSE COUNCIL MEMBERS ABOUT

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.972
HOW WE ARE SUCKING IN. RESOURCES

01:41:52.039 --> 01:41:53.674
INTO SANTA ROSA THAT ARE ALSO

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:55.509
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:56.810
COMPLETE THEIR CONSTRUCTION

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:57.678
PROJECTS

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:59.580
THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY OR

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.248
WERE GETTING UNDER WAY. SO IT'S

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.916
NOT JUST SAN AROSE IT'S NOT JUST

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.651
THE COUNTY OF CINEMA BUT REALLY

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.053
A REGIONAL PROBLEM THAT'S

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:07.521
DISPLACING FOLKS AND PREVENTING

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:08.689
US FROM BEING ABLE TO BUILD THE

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:09.556
LIMITED HOUSING WE'VE BEEN ABLE

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:16.997
TO PERMIT.

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:17.998
IS FOR US MISTER KNIPE OREGON.

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:19.466

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:20.934
IN MISMATCHED MINNESOTA'S WELL

01:42:21.001 --> 01:42:22.769
ON.

01:42:22.836 --> 01:42:24.438
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.939
SOME MEMBER LIMON TURNED TOWARD

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:27.875
MINUS YOU KNOW AND BILLY WAS FOR

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:29.910
SMALL IMPRESSED ABOUT THE COUNTY

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:30.544
OPERATION THAT YOU HAD AT YOUR

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:33.680
FOLLOWER. HOUSE AND THE PUSH OUT

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:33.847
OF.

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:34.915
.

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.617
SOCIAL WORKERS IN PARTICULAR

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.852
OPTICALLY FOR FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:40.354
HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO ASKING FOR

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.155
HELP OR DIDNOT KNOW HOW TO.

01:42:42.222 --> 01:42:43.924
ORGANIZE AND PRIORITIZE

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:46.260
HOW TO DO THAT. AFTER NOT

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.961
NEEDING TO ASK FOR HELP FOR A

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:49.830
LOT OF THEIR LIVES AND I WAS

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.331
IMPRESSED BY THAT ALSO.

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:52.266
FRIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THAT

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.767
WAS THE DAY THAT THE FEMA CREW

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.335
PACKED UP AND LEFT. AND I

01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:57.738
THOUGHT I ALREADY BECAUSE ON

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:58.405
THAT TOUR.

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:00.140
.

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.742
IT'S REALLY AYE OPENING FOR FOR

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:02.809
SOMEONE THAT REPRESENTS IN THE

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:04.711
COUNTY THAT TO GO DOWN THERE AND

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:07.147
SEE WHAT. THAT THE DESTRUCTION

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:09.349
WAS LIKE THERE SO WE SAW A LOT

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:10.250
OF IMAGES.

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.085
WHERE HOMES?

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:13.620
LOOKED BEAUTIFUL THERE THERE

01:43:13.687 --> 01:43:14.288
MAYBE IS A.

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:16.857
A LINE OF WHERE.

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.792
THE MUD SLIDE WENT TWO

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:19.860
SOMETIMES I THINK IT WAS ABOVE

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:21.495
OUR HEADS.

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:25.232
YEAH. AND AS I YOU KNOW WALKED

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.267
IN APPROACHED THE WINDOW OF ONE

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:28.635
OF THE HOMES I REALIZED HOW HIGH

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.771
I WAS.

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:31.338
IT WAS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:32.673
WINDOW.

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:34.875
AND THAT WHEN I WAS LOOKING

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:36.643
DOWN INTO THE WINDOW THAT THE

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.779
MUD WAS KITCHEN COUNTER DEPTH

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:40.380
HIGH.

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:42.482
AND.

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:43.917
AND SO YOU MIGHT LOOK.

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:45.686
YOU KNOW FRONT FROM ANOTHER.

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:46.853
PERSPECTIVE OF WHILE THE HOMES

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.722
ARE STILL OUT.

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:49.856
NO WHAT IS WHAT'S THE ISSUE

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:50.824
WHERE IT WHERE YOU KNOW IT WE

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:52.759
WANT TO COPY PARK IN SANTA ROSA

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:53.627
AND THERE'S IT'S LIKE A WAR

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:54.895
FIELD.

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:56.663
ABOUT FIELD BUT.

01:43:56.730 --> 01:43:58.699
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANYONE

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.834
RECOVERS FROM AT YOU KNOW ONE

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:02.336
HOW DID THE MIGHT FIND ITS WAY

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.004
INTO THE HOME SO PERFECTLY LIKE

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:05.272
IT WAS BUILT THEIR DOOR OPENED

01:44:05.339 --> 01:44:06.306
AND THEY WERE JUST GIVEN A TOUR.

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:08.208
AND.

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.744
IN IT IS THAT IS THAT REALLY A

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:12.145
AT THAT HOUSE TOTALED BUT IS

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:13.380
THERE A WAY TO REMEDIAL EIGHT

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:14.715
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.249
WAS MANY MONTHS LATER IS MAYBE

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.184
FOUR MONTHS LATER THAT WE DID

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.186
THAT TOUR. AND HOMEOWNER GAVE US

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:19.453
THE TOUR.

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:21.989
AND.

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:22.623
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE TO START OF

01:44:22.689 --> 01:44:23.824
COURSE.

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.525
YEAH SO CAN GIVE US A SENSE

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:27.327
ABOUT THAT SO SO YOU KNOW US

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:28.629
FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:29.396
MEMBERS ARE NOT FROM SANTA

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:31.098
BARBARA CAN GET A SENSE OF THE

01:44:31.164 --> 01:44:33.533
SCALE OF THAT THAT DESTRUCTION.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.601
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:35.202
THE QUESTION IT'S A GOOD ONE.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:36.703
.

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:39.773
IT'S DE THAT IS SO EVEN WHEN THE

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.875
HOUSE IS THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:42.643
IN MUD AND DEBRIS.

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.678
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.647
VALUE THERE THAT CAN BE SALVAGED

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:48.982
SO THE FOUNDATION THE FRAME.

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.884
.

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:52.252
IN MANY CASES WHAT WE CALL THE

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:53.220
ANY PIECE OF MECHANICAL

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:54.888
ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING SYSTEMS

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.723
ARE ARE ARE DAMAGED BUT

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:58.458
DEFINITELY.

01:44:58.525 --> 01:44:59.826
REPAIRABLE.

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:02.295
THE STILL REFUND THE BUILDING

01:45:02.362 --> 01:45:03.664
AT THE ROOF DOESN'T LEAK.

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.166
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT DOORS

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:06.833
AND WINDOWS.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.169
HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY THEM

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.437
I DO KNOW THAT THE BUDGET FOR MY

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:12.472
DIDN'T GET THAT HIGH WORTH MIGHT

01:45:12.539 --> 01:45:13.140
HIT ONE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BUT

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:14.107
NOT THE OTHER.

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:16.109
AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ALL

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.411
EXAMPLES OF MAJOR COSTS.

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:19.746
IN THE IN THE OVERALL VALUE OF

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:20.080
THE BUILDING.

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:21.682
.

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:22.282
WHICH.

01:45:22.349 --> 01:45:24.718
BY RAISING THE BUILDING

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:26.987
ENTIRELY WE WOULD WE WOULD. THEN

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:27.454
BE FORCED TO REPLACE.

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:29.523
.

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:32.125
OUR OUR ABILITY TO CONSIDER THAT

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:34.194
OPTION IT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:35.862
THE FACT THAT WHEN THE INSURANCE

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:38.331
CARRIER SEES THAT VALUE.

01:45:38.398 --> 01:45:39.933
PRESERVED ON THE PROPERTY THEY

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:40.934
WILL NOT SUPPORT.

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:43.203
IT YOU KNOW THINK THAT CLAIM

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.172
INCLUDING THE REPLACEMENT.

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.907
OF THAT VALUE AND SO AND IN MANY

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:48.375
WAYS WE HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:49.943
SALVAGE WHATEVER PARTS THE

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:51.678
BUILDING WE CAN BECAUSE. WE CAN

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:54.715
ONLY GET BE OUR RESOURCES IN THE

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.283
FORM OF AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT.

01:45:56.349 --> 01:45:58.685
TO REPLACE WHAT HAS TRULY BEEN

01:45:58.752 --> 01:45:58.919
DAMAGED.

01:45:58.985 --> 01:45:59.653
.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.855
THAT BEING SAID.

01:46:01.922 --> 01:46:02.923
TO REMOVE.

01:46:02.989 --> 01:46:04.691
OF A BUILDING FROM THE

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:07.360
LANDSCAPE ENTIRELY IS THE CHORE

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:08.895
OF A PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY TO

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:10.764
REMOVE THREE FEET ABOUT FROM THE

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:11.832
INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHILE

01:46:11.898 --> 01:46:13.567
LEAVING THE HOUSE AND TAX IS THE

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:17.104
CHORE OF. A GROUP OF TWENTY MEN

01:46:17.170 --> 01:46:17.637
AND WOMEN WITH SHOVELS AND

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:18.705
WHEELBARROWS.

01:46:18.772 --> 01:46:21.341
AND SO IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO

01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:22.576
SAY THE LEAST ARE ALSO POINT OUT

01:46:22.642 --> 01:46:23.677
TO YOU.

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.245
JUST TO.

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.414
AGAINST HAVE A SIZE AND ON YOUR

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:27.681
SURPRISE.

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:29.149
.

01:46:29.216 --> 01:46:30.817
AT THE WAY THAT THAT NIGHT HAS

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:32.452
FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE BUILDING.

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:34.454
MOTHERS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:35.822
BUILDING ASSEMBLIES AND MANY

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.357
CASES SO WE HAVE FOUND MUD

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:38.859
INSIDE OF WALL CAVITIES.

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:41.561
WE FOUND THAT MUD HAS GOTTEN.

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:44.131
INTO THE WEEK SCREED WHICH OF

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.665
THE YOU KNOW THE WE'VE HOLES FOR.

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:47.734
MOISTURE TO ESCAPE FROM STUCCO

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:48.869
CITING.

01:46:48.935 --> 01:46:51.671
SUMMIT HAS FLOWED DE UNIVERSE

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:52.506
THROUGH THE THROUGH THE WEED

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:54.207
SCREED AND INFILTRATED BEHIND

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:55.242
THE STUCCO.

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:56.476
BETWEEN THE BUILDING PAPER ON

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:58.411
THE STUCCO BETWEEN BILLION PAPER

01:46:58.478 --> 01:46:58.779
IN THE FRAMING.

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.080
.

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:01.982
BECAUSE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE THAT

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:03.717
YOU CAN IMAGINE WE FOUND BY THEN

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.485
ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOXES.

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.020
INSIDE OF.

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.022
PLUMBING PIPES AND SO THERE'S

01:47:09.089 --> 01:47:09.656
THIS REALLY.

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:11.992
QUITE A LOT OF DETAIL WORK THAT

01:47:12.058 --> 01:47:13.426
COMES ABOUT WHEN.

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:14.761
WE JUST TO SALVAGE THE BUILDING

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:16.096
SO IT'S IT'S BOTH.

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:17.998
I THINK A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

01:47:18.064 --> 01:47:18.665
THAT.

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:20.634
THAT THESE BUILDINGS AREN'T

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.501
TOTAL LOSSES.

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.003
BUT WOULD YOU REALLY RUN THE

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.371
NUMBERS YOU FIND THAT THOSE.

01:47:24.437 --> 01:47:26.840
THAT THAT THAT THAT VALUE.

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:29.042
IN MANY CASES IS ABSOLUTELY

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.377
WORTH PRESERVING.

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:31.511
SO ESSENTIAL YOU CAN BRING IT

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:33.313
DOWN OF THE STATS.

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.748
TATE OR TAKE THE CITING OFF OF

01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:36.316
THE BUILDING.

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:38.185
IT YEAH THAT'S IN IN SHORT.

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:39.920
WE CAN OFTEN WE WE CAN OFTEN

01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:42.022
CUT YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO FEET

01:47:42.088 --> 01:47:42.489
ABOVE THE FLOOD LINE.

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:43.790
.

01:47:43.857 --> 01:47:45.692
AND SELL EITHER IS HOMES HAVE

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:46.893
DRY WALL YOU KNOW FROM THREE OR

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.928
FOUR FEET UP.

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.729
BUT YOU KNOW FROM THERE DOWN

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.164
THERE OPEN STUDS.

01:47:51.231 --> 01:47:52.499
THERE'S A.

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.868
A CLEANING AND SANITATION

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:55.802
PROTOCOL.

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:57.370
THAT GOES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:57.838
BUILDING.

01:47:57.904 --> 01:48:00.674
FRAME IS FREE OF CONTAMINANTS

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.007
AND BACTERIAL.

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:02.042
.

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:03.577
GROWTH AND SO ON.

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.245
BEFORE WE CAN PUT THE BUILDING

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:07.247
BACK TOGETHER.

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:09.749
AND THAT IS THAT IS I WOULD SAY.

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.585
BY AND LARGE THE STEP THAT THAT

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:12.986
WE'VE WE'VE JUST COMPLETED BUT

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.688
MOST OF THESE PROJECTS AND SO

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:15.422
IT'S IT'S BEEN THAT LONG IN

01:48:15.488 --> 01:48:16.089
COMING.

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.824
MEDIUM PARA WE HAVE ALL OF THE

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.125
INSURANCE TO GO SHE SINCE THE

01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:20.627
PERMANENT CHALLENGES THAT I WAS.

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:21.995
DISCUSSING BUT.

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:23.296
IT'S A IT'S A PAINSTAKING

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:24.931
PROCESS AND AND VERY LABOR

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:25.198
INTENSIVE.

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:26.833
.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.835
TO SET ASIDE WAS IMPRESSED BY

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:30.237
THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:32.105
STRUCTURES GIVEN. THE SPEED AND

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.740
FORCE BY WHICH THAT MUD SLOWED

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:34.641
DOWN.

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:36.376
THE HILL AND IN AND OUT DOWN

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:38.345
THAT ROAD.

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:39.846
YET I THINK THERE'S SOME LESSONS.

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.348
IN RESILIENCE THEIR.

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:43.316
YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES

01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:43.483
OF.

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:45.385
.

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.086
YOU KNOW ONE HOUSE SAVING

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:48.221
ANOTHER. OR A GARDEN WALL OR

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:49.322
EVEN A FENCE LINE.

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:51.658
SAVING HOUSE.

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.226
OF SUBSIDED I KNOW THAT MANY

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:54.628
THE COUNTY PLANNERS ARE AT HAVE

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:55.929
SERIOUS CONCERNS.

01:48:55.996 --> 01:48:58.098
AROUND TAMANA SEAT OF BECOMING

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.199
A WALLED CITY.

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:02.335
IF FROM HERE ON OUT AND THERE

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:02.769
ARE.

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:03.737
YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN TYPES

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:05.071
OF GARDEN WALLS THAT CAN BE

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:05.972
BUILT WITHOUT.

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:08.675
TENDING OVERSIGHT AND PLANNING

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:08.909
REVIEW.

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:09.709
.

01:49:09.776 --> 01:49:11.011
AND SO HOMEOWNERS HAVE A CERTAIN

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:13.213
FREEDOM THERE THAT MAY END UP.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.915
COMING BACK AND AND BITING US

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.750
AS A COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE CAN

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:17.817
ONLY CHANNEL LIES.

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:19.853
FUTURE TO PROPOSED SAID SO.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.088
THOUGHT YOU TO SUCH AN EXTENT

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:23.757
BEFORE IT BECOMES A REAL.

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:25.458
A COMPLICATED PROBLEM YEAH

01:49:25.525 --> 01:49:27.727
THERE'S ALSO THE RANDOMNESS OF.

01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:28.762
THE HOME NEXT DOOR ACROSS THE

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:30.363
STREET IS COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:31.398
WHILE THE OTHER HOMES ALL HAD

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.600
THE BIG BOULDERS. JUST PARKED

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.002
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:36.202
YEAH.

01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:38.271
THE LEADING ABOUT THE PHYSICS

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:39.472
OF OF DEBRIS FLOWS.

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:40.941
BUT

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:50.784
BUT THEY ARE VERY DISCREET YOU

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:51.351
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:52.452
STRUCTURE TO THEM AND HEIGHT AND

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:52.686
SO THE.

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:53.219
KNOWS THE PREFLIGHT MOVE

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:53.820
THROUGH TOWN AS A AS A AS A

IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US.

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:52.472
THE.

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:54.307
.

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:55.775
THE CHARACTER OF THAT TYPE OF

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:56.943
LABOR THAT WERE GOING TO NEED

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.378
THOUGH IS GOING TO SHIFT TOWARDS

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.313
THE MORE SKILLED TRADES AS WE

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.414
MOVE INTO THE RECONSTRUCTION

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:02.749
PHASE SO AGAIN IN OF THE.

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:04.584
AT LEAST AT LEAST WITHIN THE

01:52:04.651 --> 01:52:06.519
SAMPLE SET THAT OUR CLIENTS

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:06.786

PHASES SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:15.328
ACROSS MOST OF THOSE PROJECTS

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.930
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND WE

01:52:16.996 --> 01:52:17.864

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:32.645
LITTLE DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:33.046
THEY.

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:34.814

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:35.882
DEAL WITH THE COMING SURGE OF

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:37.884
WORK AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN THE

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:39.419

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:18.344
IT WILL MATTER WHETHER THEY

01:55:23.283 --> 01:55:25.184
IF YOU CHANGE.

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:27.020
AS THE UTILITIES PROPOSING

THEY ARE. WITHIN IT.

01:55:42.268 --> 01:55:43.436
BUT THE OTHER POINT THAT THEY'RE

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:44.070
NOT AND I'VE LEARNED THIS FROM

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:45.471

HOW FIRES OR MUDSLIDES ARE

IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEN

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:55.648

AN INSURANCE SYSTEM THAT SET UP

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:31.430
FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO LOSE THEIR

01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:33.766

WHO HAVE BEEN ON LOCAL

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:38.404
GOVERNMENT KNOW HOW PERSONALLY

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:40.573
GETS. ARE NOT EQUIPPED AND DON'T

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.507
HAVE THE TOOLS TO DEAL WITH

01:59:41.574 --> 01:59:43.509
MASSIVE.

01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:45.912
ECONOMIC SHIFTS IN THE SYSTEM

01:59:45.978 --> 01:59:47.079
SO THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:48.581
THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE THAT

OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE UNDER

01:59:49.849 --> 01:59:51.651
INSURED IF THEY HAD LOST THEIR

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:53.519
HOMES ONLY. THEY WOULD BE MORE

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:55.755
THAN MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:57.156
REBUILD BUT WHEN YOU SEE A

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:59.025
TWENTY PERCENT SHIFT IN THE COST

01:59:59.091 --> 02:00:00.993

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.628
IN THE COST OF MATERIALS. THE

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:04.263
WAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:05.898
INSURANCE STRUCTURE DOES NOT

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:07.633
ACCOUNT FOR ANY OF THAT.

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.101
THE WAY THAT MY CONSTITUENTS

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:11.604
HAVE TO ITEMIZE THEIR DEDUCTIONS.

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:14.540
IN ORDER TO BE PAID OUT THAT'S

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:16.108
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN AT THE

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:17.910
CHAIR HAS A FANTASTIC BILL

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:20.513

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:23.549
DOLLARS. ON ANOTHER LOT THAT

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:25.217
HASN'T BEEN CONTEMPLATED BEFORE

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:26.319
AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:28.254
BECAUSE OF THE SCOPE AND THE

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:29.221
SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:00:29.288 --> 02:00:31.357
IS SO BIG. THAT TWO YEAR RULE

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.526
FOR INSURANCE TO REBUILD IS ALSO

02:00:33.593 --> 02:00:35.928
A BIG HINDRANCE

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.563

DEALING WITH THE INSURANCE

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:48.708

WAY WE PRODUCE PERMIT FEES

02:00:57.817 --> 02:00:59.118
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:00.486

02:01:00.553 --> 02:01:01.721
PERCENT HAVE NOT SETTLED WITH

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:03.289
THEIR INSURANCE YET. THAT THAT'S

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:05.691
WHERE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE FOR

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:09.695
REFORM. THE OTHERS WANT AYE
