00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.180
OF TRUCKS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.816
USE OR ISSUE VIS THAT THEY NEED

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.651
TO HAVE IN ORDER TO MOVE. THE

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:20.752
FAMILY MEMBERS AROUND IN A

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.588
VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS WHY

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.855
SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE A VEHICLE

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.791
THAT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:26.925
PRICEY. AND MAY IN FACT

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.493
REPRESENT A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.029
PORTION OF THE- NET INCOME OF

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:34.199
THE FAMILY INVOLVED BUT- JUST

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:36.201
SETTING A VALUE OF COULD HAVE

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.070
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO I

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.205
WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE-

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.940
SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THAT ITEM

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.809
. WITH REGARD TO THE ONE YOUR

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:44.943
PAWS ON AN INCREASE IN STATE

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.546
DIESEL TAXES AYE. I'M NOT ABLE

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.181
TO TELL FROM THE ANALYSIS

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:51.550
EXACTLY WHAT THAT ENTAILS. OTHER

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:55.187
THAN THE PLAIN LANGUAGE- IN THE

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:57.656
ANALYSIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO

00:20:57.723 --> 00:21:00.492
REDUCE. THE PRICE OF DIESEL AT

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:03.428
THE PUMP. SO THANK YOU FOR THE

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.863
QUESTION IT IS EXPECTED TO

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.398
REDUCE THE PRICE OF DIESEL UPON

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.234
SO THE EXAM. THE EXEMPTION IS A

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.336
GENERAL FUND EXEMPTION SALES TAX

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.571
EXEMPTION ON THE PRICE OF DIESEL

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.606
FUEL. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:18.310
APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE OF THE

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:21.847
PRICE OF A WITH A- 4% RATE

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:23.682
THAT'S APPLIED TO THE- TO THE-

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.584
TAXES TAXABLE DIESEL FUEL SALES

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:28.220
SO. IT SHOULD LOWER THE PRICE OF

00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:31.089
DIESEL OUT OF FIVE BY IN THE

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.458
FULL AMOUNT. SO WHY NOT MAYBE

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:35.994
THIS QUESTION WAS YES. IN A

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.362
SENSE BY MY COLLEAGUE THE VICE

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.698
CHAIR BUT WHY NOT SUSPEND THE

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:42.868
TAX ALTOGETHER FOR A PERIOD OF

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.537
TIME SINCE THE- BOTH THE PAUSE

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:47.773
ON THE INCREASE AND A SUSPENSION

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:49.975
WOULD BOTH SEEM TO ME HAVE A- AN

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:52.310
IMPACT ON THE DIRECTED

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:55.781
TRANSPORTATION FUND ACCOUNT.

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:58.016
WELL THAT THE DIESEL- THE

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.685
GENERAL FUND SALES TAX ON THE

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:02.654
DIESEL FUEL IS- IS A DIFFERENT A

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.822
DIFFERENT ANIMAL SO TO SPEAK

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:06.458
AND- EXCISE TAXES ON THE- ON THE

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:08.460

BILL INCLUDES A AYE BACKFILL

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.812
PROVISION THAT ENSURES THAT THE

SAME THE SAME AMOUNT WILL GO

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.148

IT TO BE QUITE HONEST I HAVEN'T

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.152
BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY TRACTION.

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.520

THAT ONE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:19.804
IT- IT MAY EVEN MAKE MORE SENSE-

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:22.140
TO- EXAMINE WHETHER THAT

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:23.375
JURISDICTION IS BUILDING THE

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:24.576
READING NUMBERS BEFORE THEY CAN

TO ME THAT. THE SITUATION IS

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:36.321
EVEN WORSE THAN YOU DESCRIBED IT

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:38.189
THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WANTS TO

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:40.392
MAKE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:43.895
ROADWAYS- THERE ARE PROHIBITED

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:44.929
FROM USING STATE FUNDS TO DO

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:49.501
THAT- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. YOU

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.903
CAN'T USE IT TO IMPROVE-

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.606
COMMUTER TRAFFIC SO TO SPEAK AND

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.808
I AND I THINK THAT INCLUDES A

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:57.475
HIGHWAYS AS WELL SO EVEN EVEN

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.844
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THAT'LL

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:00.445
PROTECT THE PUBLIC CANNOT BE

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:05.316

ON THIS ONE- AS WELL AS THE-

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:38.443

THAT THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED IN

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:49.521
THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED AS ONE

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:52.857
OF THE RECIPIENTS IF YOU IF YOU-

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:54.325

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SMALL

00:29:59.797 --> 00:30:01.900
INDEPENDENT THEATERS IN- IN

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.801
RURAL CALIFORNIA THEY COULD

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.403
THERE WERE REALLY ON THE VERGE

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.705
OF BANKRUPTCY AND SO ANYTHING WE

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.774
CAN DO I THINK TO HELP THE

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:11.843
MACHINE WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.312
AND THEN- JUST- MADAM CHAIR ON

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.748
IBM. YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS HARD

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:20.084
TO LOOK IN IN THE CRYSTAL BALL

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:22.554
BUT- BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.756
I APPRECIATE THE L. A. O.'S

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.558
CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THESE

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:32.197
FUNDS- WE INSTITUTED A NUMBER.

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.965
OF GRANT PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.000
WANTED TO GET. MONEY OUT THE

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.669
DOOR AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:39.137
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:43.975
OUR ECONOMY- AND- I'M WONDERING

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:48.780
IF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS- ARE

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:49.914
REALLY APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT.

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:53.585
THE CHANGIN ECONOMIC

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.453
CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU WILL AND I

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.789
THINK THE CAUTION ABOUT THE

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.257
HEIGHTENED RISK RISK OF

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.858
RECESSION WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:02.660
COUPLE YEARS IS SOMETHING AND

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.597
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT- YOU

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.065
KNOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY FEELING

00:31:07.131 --> 00:31:09.834
THE STRAIN OF THE HIGHER GAS

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:13.471
PRICES THE HIGHER THE RISK THAT

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:17.542
THE- INFLATION- THE UNCERTAINTY

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:20.511
CREATED BY- THE STOCK MARKET

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:23.114
IT'S I'M ASSUMING IS REACTING

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:28.886
TO- TO. THE WAR AND- PEOPLE ARE

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:30.054
CONCERNED AND I THINK-

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:33.858
RIGHTFULLY- SCARED ABOUT THAT.

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.660
WHERE WHERE EXACTLY ARE KANEMI

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:38.596
IS GOING AND- THE GOOD THING IS

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:41.232
THAT EMPLOYMENT IS UP WAGES ARE

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.533
UP THERE SAID JUST SOME REALLY

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.470
GOOD POSITIVE STUFF BUT THE

00:31:45.536 --> 00:31:47.405
EMPLOYMENT BEING UP AND WAGES

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:49.440
BEING IS NOT WHAT FILLS OUR

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:50.842
COFFERS. SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:52.143
ABOUT HER A RECESSION I'M

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.545
CONCERNED ABOUT SPENDING MONEY

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:56.481
THAT WE IN THE LONG TERM CAN'T

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.750
SUPPORT IN SO- HOPE HOPEFULLY WE

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:03.821
TAKE A- TAKE THAT TO HEART. AND-

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.590
THAT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.525
ABOUT THIS PORTION OF THE BUDGET

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.261

INDEPENDENT THEATERS I THINK

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.615
IT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT THE

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:32.283
GOVERNOR OF THE FINANCE WOODFILL

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.920

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:38.489
THEY ARE NOT HUGE BUT THEY'RE

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:40.658
SIGNIFICANT IN THESE COMMUNITIES

KINDS OF SCENARIOS YOU HAVE

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.142
SCENARIOS WHERE FOLKS OWN CARS

00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:32.643
THAT MAYBE THEY CAN OR CAN'T

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.679
AFFORD AND IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.414
JUDGE SOMEBODY FOR THE KIND OF

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:39.484
CAR THAT THEY PURCHASE BUT- IT

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.918

THAT LIVES HERE IS THAT A

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.348
SCENARIO WHERE THAT CAR WOULD BE

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:13.518
EXEMPT- IS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.119

REBATE PROGRAM THAT IS FLEXIBLE

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:31.068

WANTING TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY.

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:39.177
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.344
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF FOLKS

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:43.080
THAT HAVE CARS. NOTE THAT IN AN

APARTMENT F. AND ANSWERED A LOT

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.519
OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND SO

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:49.921
THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR.

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.255
RIGHT REGISTER VEHICLE WOULD BE

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.990
LINKED TO THAT REGISTERED

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.826

ENVISION THE PARAMETERS THAT

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.473
WOULD BE BUILT AROUND THIS TO BE

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:11.742
ABLE TO KIND OF. SHOW WHERE-

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:13.911
THAT CHECKS MIGHT BE EXPECTED

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:14.545
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:16.380
HAVE IT AS PART OF THE MAY

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:19.350
REVISION AS WE HAVE- SOME

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:20.551
SUPPORT DOLLARS A CONTRACT ALL.

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:21.919
THE MOTOR VEHICLE BECAUSE WE

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:22.687
ANTICIPATE. FOLKS WILL BE

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:25.523
CALLING AND ASKING ABOUT- THESE

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.657
CHECKS SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:28.659
TRYING TO KIND OF LAY OUT THE

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:29.827
FRAMEWORK IN THAT LANGUAGE BUT

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:30.895
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.296
PARAMETERS AND THERE ARE A

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:33.297
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.333
THAT COULD BE- CONTEMPLATED

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.934
HERE. YOU ALSO HAVE SCENARIOS

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:38.503
WHERE SOMEONE MAY HAVE A CAR AND

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:40.538
MAYBE THE PERSON THAT THE CAR IS

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:41.506
REGISTERED TO. YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.441
THEY'RE INVOLVED IN A CUSTODY

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.276
BATTLE MAYBE THERE YOU KNOW- YOU

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:48.045
KNOW SORT OF. A DOMESTIC

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:49.580
VIOLENCE SURVIVOR ALL CAPS IN

00:35:49.647 --> 00:35:51.449
THE AREA SO I JUST I THINK

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.550
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:54.352
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE REALITIES

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.254
OF VEHICLE OWNERS AND HOW THEY

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.823
HAVE CARS. IN IN IN WHAT YOU'RE

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.491
ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.126
WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:03.961
AND THEN IT SAYS SEVEN HUNDRED

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:04.595
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.330

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:12.870
IT IN CERTAIN REGIONS IS IT UP

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.171
TO A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT. IS

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:17.642
IT. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:18.576
I MEAN WHAT IS THAT. YEAH AND

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.645
THAT'S BEING THEM AND THE

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.480
TRANSPORTATION AREA AS OTHER

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:23.548
SUBCOMMITTEES BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.448
THROUGH THE LOCAL TRANSIT

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.317
AGENCIES SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:27.752
OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.787

PERSON IT'S THROUGH THAT TRANSIT

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:43.734
AGENCIES. I SEE AND SO THEN BACK

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.570

EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS KIND OF A-

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.386
A MODEL IN THE FRAMEWORK SO

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.054
THESE ARE OUR- BEST ESTIMATES OF

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.489

CRITERIA BUT IT'S BASED ON

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:57.074
FEDERAL CODES AND SO I THINK THE

THE ACTUAL GRANTS AMOUNTS AND

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.217
HOW WE THINK THIS MIGHT MAKE AN

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.353
IMPACT. WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.590
THIRTY THE GRANT SIZES ARE

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:15.225
THIRTY FORTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND.

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:16.927
WE THINK THAT'S GOING HAVE. AN

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.762
ACTUAL INJECTION THAT HELPS.

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.898
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS FOR THE

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.334
STRUGGLING BUSINESSES WE'RE NOT

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.936
SAYING WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:26.770
IMPRESSION THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:29.039
COMPLETELY ERASE- WHATEVER

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.174
REVENUE YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.576
THAT'S- THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:35.746
GOAL OR- WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.748
ILLUSION- WE WILL KNOW THOUGH

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:40.084
THAT THE SIZES OF GRANTS ARE

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.719
LARGER THAN WITH THE COVERT

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.354
RELEASED GRANT PROGRAM. THE

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.022
SPECIFIC REASON FOR THE LARGER

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:47.091
GRANT AMOUNTS IS WE DESIGNED

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.826
THEM SO THAT GIVEN THE SCALE OF

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:52.196
AGRICULTURE. I EVEN IF YOU ONLY

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:53.263
HAVE TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FULL

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.966
TIME EMPLOYEES YOUR CASH FLOW

00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.968
YEAH IT IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.937
BE LARGER THAN A SMALL RETAILER

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.405
OR SOMETHING IN A DOWNTOWN.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.374
ENVIRONMENT SO THE SCALE OF THE

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.743
BUSINESSES IS REQUIRES A LITTLE

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.578
BIT MORE OF A CASH INJECTION TO

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:09.113
MAKE AN IMPACT. THAT'S WHY WE

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.048
WORK WITH THESE AMOUNTS- BUT OF

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.316
COURSE WE NEED A BALANCED

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.384
AGAINST THE FACT THAT THE STATE

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.687
CAN'T- FULLY FIND ALL ALL

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.756
POSSIBLE LOSSES. WELL YOU'RE IN

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:19.556
LUCK BECAUSE THAT QUESTION

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.992
TRIGGERED A QUESTION FROM VICE

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:25.929
CHAIR NIELSEN. SURE YOU ARE

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:28.799
TALKING TO A FORMER. AND THIS IS

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:32.636
ALMOST INSULTING WHY BOTHER. THE

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:35.272
DISPLACED AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.674
CROPS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.810
NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY AT THE

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:43.080
MINIMUM THE 80% OF CROPS NOT

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:45.749
PLANTED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:48.285
WATER BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT.

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.353
HELLO INTERJECTED MOTHER

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.689
THOUGHT. TO THAT EFFECT. THIS

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.224
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE ALMOST

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.193
NOTHING TO EXPEDITE THE

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.362
CONSTRUCTION OF SITES RESERVOIR

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.230
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE WATER FOR

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.132
ENVIRONMENTAL AGRICULTURAL AND

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.368
DOMESTIC USE- TYPICALLY

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:07.037
ENVIRONMENTAL AND AGRICULTURE SO

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:09.540
YOU'RE IGNORING SUPPLY. BUT NOW

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:10.774
IN THIS DROUGHT WHICH WE'RE

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.077
GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE SOON I

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.278
DON'T SEE THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:17.548
LOOKING FORWARD ANYWAY. AND

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:20.684
THESE SMALL FARMS. CUTTING OFF

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:23.854
THAT MUCH REVENUE DOESN'T JUST

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.022
CUT OFF THAT REVENUE TO THE

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:28.092
FARMER IT CUT OUT JOBS TO FORMER

00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:31.428
EMPLOYEES. IT CUTS OUT INCOME

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:32.763
THAT WILL SUSTAIN LOCAL

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.732
COMMUNITIES I WOULD SUBMIT TAKE

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:38.569
THAT BACK TO YOUR LEADERSHIP AND

00:45:38.635 --> 00:45:41.071
SUGGEST THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:45.075
THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. I AND I

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:46.643
JUST ONE OH SORRY YES PLEASE.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.546
BUDGET JUST GONNA KNOW THAT YES

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:50.814
I CAN TAKE THOSE FROM INSPECTOR

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.550
PROJECT THAT. THANK YOU AND I

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:54.551
JUST WANNA ADD THAT I THINK THAT

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.887
THERE ARE FARMS THAT ARE DEALING

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:57.421
WITH ISSUES. INCLUDING THE

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.123
DROUGHT BUT ALSO WITH ADDITIONAL

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:01.291
ISSUES TO AND SO I MEAN I WOULD

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.426
THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:04.962
SMALL FARMS THAT AID MAKE NOT BE

00:46:05.028 --> 00:46:06.497
IN SACRAMENTO OR IN THE SAN

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:07.598
JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT ARE DEALING

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.366
WITH OTHER ISSUES. THAT WOULD

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.567
ALSO BE REALLY DESIROUS OF

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:12.002
HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.605
FOR GRANTS SO. ON THE SECOND

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:19.042
THING IS. THE- MOVING INTO I

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.744

THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.471
PAST WAS NOT WORKING. AND SO

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:50.207

THE FACT THAT THIS WAS HIGHLY

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:31.782

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:26.896
ARE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.331
AND- AND AS I RECALL AND I DON'T

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.532
RECALL THE SPECIFICS EITHER

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.366
THERE WAS A THIRTY SOMETHING

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:35.338
COURT AS I RECALL IF I'M

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.939
CORRECT. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.574
SOME WERE SOME OTHER COMPONENTS

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:39.542
THAT WERE DEALT WITH IN OTHER

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.510
PARTS OF THE BUDGET BUDGET THE

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:42.545
ONLY REASON I MENTION IT. IS

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.447
CARE CORD IS REFERENCED IN OUR

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:47.817
ANALYSIS UNDER. THE UNDER THE

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.352
HELP PROGRAM. IF MY POINT IS

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.686
THIS. THERE'S SOME HOUSING

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.455
COMPONENTS OF THE CARE COURT

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.191
PROGRAM AS I UNDERSTAND IT. AND

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:56.492
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.127
THOSE HOUSING COMPONENTS

01:04:58.194 --> 01:04:59.695
SEPARATELY FROM THESE OTHER.

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:03.032
THESE OTHER HOUSING- ELEMENTS.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.667
THEY WERE DEALING WITH TODAY

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.769
UNDER THIS ITEM ZERO FIVE ONE

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.537
FIVE. AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.773
HAVE TO GO BEYOND THE EXISTING

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.407
FUNDING LEVELS IN THESE OTHER

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.142
PROGRAMS JUST BECAUSE THE NEED

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.011
IS GREAT AND WE'RE ADDING.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.480
ADDITIONAL NEED WITH THE CARE

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.382

. HOUSING HAS BEEN IF YOU ASK

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.407
THE PUBLIC WHAT THE ISSUE IS

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:45.574
THAT THEY'RE MOST CONCERNED

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.009
ABOUT IT IT'S BEEN HOUSING FOR

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:51.647
MANY YEARS- AND- MMHM. IT'S

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.716
ALMOST UNIVERSAL THROUGHOUT THE

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.719
STATE THAT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.055
AND THE LACK OF HOUSING IS A

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.923
CRITICAL ISSUE I REALLY

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.125
APPRECIATE THE FOCUS THAT WE'VE

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:06.796
HAD ON HOUSING BUT BUT I ALSO

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:10.499
ANA I'M I'M I'VE BEEN CONCERNED

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:13.536
. ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:19.575
ABOUT- BEST PRACTICES I THINK IS

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:25.047
THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT- AND PART

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.482
OF THE CHALLENGE ABOUT UNIT

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.351
REPRESENTING SIX COUNTIES I GOT

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.719
A CALL SIX COUNTIES AND FIND OUT

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:31.687
WHAT WHAT THEY DID WITH THEIR

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:32.722
HAPPEN THERE HE FINDS AND- AND

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:35.725
IT IT'S DIFFERENT AND I WONDER

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:36.726
IF WE HAVE SOME MODELS OUT THERE

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.628
THAT THAT ARE ARE MORE EFFICIENT

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.130
MORE EFFECTIVE IN REALLY

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:42.131
ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE OFF THE

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:44.200
STREET SO I'M WONDERING IF WE

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:47.503
HAVE- WE STARTED TO ASK FOR SOME

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.006
SOME DATA BUT- BUT I'M WONDERING

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:51.774
IF WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.043
EVALUATES THE SUCCESS OF THE

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.479
PROGRAM'S AND MIGHT CONCERN IS

01:06:56.545 --> 01:07:00.216
THAT- WE HEARD A BILL RECENTLY

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.785
ABOUT THE HOUSING FIRST PROGRAM.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.253
TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.756
THAT AND I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:07.590
THERE MAY BE SOME INTEREST LONG

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.657
TERM TO LOOKING AT OTHER

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:10.226
STRATEGIES AND OTHER MODELS

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.895
THAT- THAT THAT CAN WORK IN

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.363
CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOUSING

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.665
FIRST BUT I'M WONDERING FIRST OF

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.334
ALL DO WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT AND

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.069
I'M LOOKING AT THE HOMELESS

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:20.536
HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:22.171
PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH IS A

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:23.472
HALF BROTHER TO CONTINUE FINDING

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.041
IT WHICH I THINK I THINK WE HAVE

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:29.211
TO DO- DO WE HAVE IS AB AB

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:31.414
SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.785
OF THE PROGRAM. AND- AND IS

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:40.256
THERE. YES THE OTHER PART OF IT

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:43.192
IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.494
THAT EVERY THAT THERE IS IT'S

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.296
CLEAR THAT THIS THESE ARE STATE

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:48.798
FUNDS THAT ARE BEING USED THIS

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.400
QUITE FRANKLY WHEN I HEAR ABOUT

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.169
A ROLL OUT OF THE PROGRAM THE

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:54.904
CITIES IN THE COUNTY SAID SAY

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.506
HEY WE DID A GREAT JOB PUTTING

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.140
THIS PROGRAM TOGETHER AND THEN

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.275
THEY FORGET THAT WERE PARTNERS

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.644
IN IT SO I'M WONDERING IF

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:02.344
THERE'S A WAY I MEAN THAT'S

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.712
IT'S- IT'S SELF SERVING IN MANY

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.514
WAYS BUT IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.515
THAT. THAT THEY FEEL LIKE

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.451
THEY'VE GOT TO GIVE US DATA AND

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.752
INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.820
EVALUATE WHETHER FUNDS ARE BEING

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:12.855
UTILIZED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.757
WHERE WHERE THEY MEET WE NEED TO

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.426
MAKE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM. YES

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:18.461
THERE ARE THERE ARE DATA

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.029
REPORTING ELEMENTS REQUIRED FOR

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.898
ACCOUNTS- LOCALS- CITIES AND

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.467
COUNTIES YOU CAN USE. CONTINUES

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.801
OF CARE THEY UPLOAD DATA

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.703
REGULARLY TO THE- CALIFORNIA

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.272
INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:33.309
HOMELESSNESS ISSUE- BUT BUT HOW

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:36.612
THE PROGRAMS ARE SO NEW THAT-

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.381
THERE ARE NOT ANY. REPORTS YET

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:43.652
OUT THERE- THAT HAVE OUTCOMES-

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:46.388
WERE. NASCENT STAGES OF THESE

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.757
PROGRAMS AND SAME WITH ON CAMPUS

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:51.694
SO- WE'RE WE'RE DEVELOPING A

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.395
DOUBT EVER GETTING DOWN ON DOWN

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.764
WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION ON ON-

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:58.534
OUTCOMES KELLY C. H. WE'D ALL BE

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:02.238
NOW BUT WE DON'T THIS EARLY

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.572
STAGE HAPPENING YEAH. WELL I

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:06.942
HAVE PROGRAM IT'S TRUE THAT IT'S

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.310
FAIRLY NEW BECAUSE WE I KEEP

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:12.948
FIRST RIGHT AND THEN HE PROGRAM-

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.351
WAS AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.286
AND SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY I KIND

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.054
OF FEEL LIKE HAPPY AS THE

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:19.989
OUTGROWTH OF HEAPING MAYBE MAYBE

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:22.324
THAT. THE DETAILS WERE DIFFERENT

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.493
SO MAYBE I'M NOT BEING FAIR

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.462
ABOUT THAT BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.664
ME THAT SINCE I RETURNED TO THE

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.432
LEGISLATURE AND WE MADE HOUSING

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:33.335
A PRIORITY WHEN THESE THREE OR

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.371
FOUR YEARS NOW- I HAVEN'T SEEN

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.873
THE DATA WHEN I ASK FOR IT

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:39.441
LOCALLY IT'S VERY. VERY HARD TO

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.844
GET AND I'M I WORRY THAT WE'RE

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.379
RECYCLING PEOPLE THROUGH THE

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:44.713
PROGRAM AND THAT WE'RE NOT

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.315
GETTING THEM PERMANENTLY OFF THE

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:47.983
STREETS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.919
ISN'T SEEM TO GET. TO GET BETTER

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:52.354
IN SO I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.989
DATA OR A LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:56.392
AND- TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THAT

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.993
BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT- AS

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.663
MUCH MONEY AS WE'RE SPENDING ON

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:04.567
THIS ISSUE- AP. I HATE TO RELY

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.268
ON VIGNETTE STORIES BECAUSE IT

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:07.770
DOESN'T TELL US WHETHER WE'RE

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.505
DOING WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.740
TO. MAKE A DENT IN THE PROBLEM

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:14.109
AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S- IT'S SOME

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.978
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DISTINCT

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.546
ISSUES IN THE HOMELESS

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:20.115
POPULATION THAT ARE REALLY

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.216
DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER BUT I

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:24.119
DO THINK THAT. THAT- THERE WE

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.522
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE IF IT IF

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.490
FOR PURCHASING PROPERTIES TO BE

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.259
ABLE TO HOME HOUSE THE HOMELESS

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.527
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.696
PROPERTIES CAN BE MAINTAINED AND

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:35.764
THAT THEY CAN BE- THAT THEIR

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:38.801
SECURED IN A WAY THAT THAT. IT

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.669
STAYS. BUT PROPERTY AND IT

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.304
DOESN'T GO INTO THE HANDS OF

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.206
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS THAT USE

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.141
STATE FUNDS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.610
TO. TO BUILD SOMETHING AND THEN

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:50.646
NOT REALLY KEEP IT. IN THE

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:57.119
PUBLIC. DOMAIN AND THAT. AS WE

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.187
GET MORE SOPHISTICATED ABOUT HOW

01:10:58.253 --> 01:11:01.557
WE- HELP PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:03.592
STREETS THAT THERE'S A WAY FOR

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.894
THEM TO STAY. OFF THE STREETS SO

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.463
THAT WITH WITH ENDED DON'T TURN

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.765
AROUND AND DO IT SACRAMENTO DID

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.066
RECENTLY WHICH IS THEY SAID HEY

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.568
WE'RE CLOSING THIS UP WE CAN NO

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.703
LONGER MAINTAIN IT AND- PEOPLE

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.472
WERE BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN SO

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:17.840
THAT I GUESS THAT'S MY BIGGEST

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.575
CONCERN ABOUT THE EVALUATION AND

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:21.543
MAKING SURE WE'VE GOT THAT.

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:24.446
CONDITIONS IN PLACE TO MAIN TO

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.982
ENSURE THAT THE MONEY THEN THAT

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:29.351
IS BEING SPENT ON THESE.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:32.588
CONVERSIONS OF MOTELS. RESULT IN

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:36.625
THEM BEING PART OF UP A PUBLIC.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:39.695
ASSET IF YOU WILL THAT THE

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:40.829
COMMUNITIES HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.231
HOUSE PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.699
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE HOMELESS THEY

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:44.967
CAN BE OTHER INDIVIDUALS

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.468
FAMILIES AND THOSE YOU KNOW

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:51.140
SENIORS AND- I AM CONCERNED THAT

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:54.543
WE MAINTAIN ALL OF THAT- SO

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:58.080
THAT. MISPRISION CONCERNS AND

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.449
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:01.050
COMMITTED TO HAVING

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:03.318
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LEVERAGING

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.587
POSSIBLE ONGOING POSSIBLE LONGER

OVERALL STATE BUDGET. THE

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:56.284

THE SIMPLEST WAY TO ASK THE

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:06.741
QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE SO

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:09.243
MANY PROGRAMS THAT WE- EITHER

DOLLARS. AND THEN HAVE FOLKS.

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.183
HAVE TO CHASE BUCKET AFTER

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:57.084
BUCKET AFTER BUCKET. BECAUSE

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:59.287
WHAT WE'VE ALSO TO LEARN IS

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:01.756
THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH BRAIDING

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:05.626
THAT HAPPENS. THAT I MEAN WE

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.695
WANT AND YOU KNOW THAT IT JUST

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.797
WE END UP NOT BEING ABLE TO BE

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.365
AS EFFICIENT WITH THE DOLLARS

CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.837
DOING THIS WORK BECAUSE WE'VE

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:18.139
CREATED ALL OF THESE SEPARATE

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.807
BUCKETS. WHEN AT THE END OF THE

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.642
DAY THEY HAVE IDEAS ABOUT WHERE

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:23.411
FOLKS ARE WHO ARE AND HOUSE IN

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:25.179
THE BEST WAYS TO GET THEM HOUSE.

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.614
I MEAN YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.115
KINDS OF SOLUTIONS. THAT

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:32.186
DIFFERENT- JURISDICTIONS ARE-

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:39.393
COMING UP WITH SO. I'M THE

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.796
ADAPTIVE RE USE IS REALLY

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:46.934
EXCITING- NEW PROGRAM- KIND OF

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:48.669
QUESTIONING HOW MANY UNITS COULD

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:50.238
THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING CREATED

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:53.407
ME WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING TO

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:57.879
HAPPEN WITH THIS. YEAH OTHERS

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.547
SAY THEY SHOULD BE I THINK IT'S

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:00.948
DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW MANY UNITS

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.917
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:04.685
ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENT SOMETIMES

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:07.021
INFRASTRUCTURE SO- VERY SIMILAR

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.123
TO PROBABLY FIFTY ARE REALLY.

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.091
INTELLIGENT RESEARCHER GRANT

01:32:10.157 --> 01:32:12.493
PROGRAMS WE OFFER ASSISTANCE

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:17.131
FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE PERMISSIBLE

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:19.066
DETAILS. SO I THINK WE'RE HERE

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.769
IS I TO- NOT READ ANYTHING

01:32:21.836 --> 01:32:22.637
CERTAINLY LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:24.338
OF DISTRESS- DISTRUST ARE UNDER

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.140
LESS PROPERTIES- IN THE

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.609
COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW ME NOT.

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.311
WE CAN IN TERMS OF HOW MANY

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.712
UNITS IT WOULD CREATE I THINK

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:33.314
THAT'S PROBABLY TO REALLY HELLO-

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:34.282
BECAUSE THESE WOULD BE THE

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:35.283
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:37.084
WOULD BE TO HOUSING.

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.287
TRANSFORMATIVE TYPE CATALYTIC

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.022
THINGS WITHIN. OUR COMMUNITY

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:46.294
BUT- WE CAN CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.762
THIS WE WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:49.797
MAKE. OKAY GREAT AND THE FINAL

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:50.431
COMMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:51.832
ADDITIONAL ADAPTIVE REUSE

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:53.734
FUNDING YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.836
THINK THAT THIS IS- VERY

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:58.706
EXCITING- AND I WAS THINKING

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.841
ABOUT A NUMBER OF CORRIDORS

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.778
THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT- WHERE I

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:05.046
HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:07.748
OPPORTUNITY FOR MIXED USE TO

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.050
TURN LIGHT INDUSTRIAL OR

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:13.587
COMMERCIAL. INTO USE- AND ALSO

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:17.325
REALLY HOPING THAT THERE THAT.

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:21.662
THIS IS- REALLY THOUGHTFUL- AND

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.931
TARGETED BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:25.666
LOT OF SCURRILOUS DEVELOPERS OUT

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.401
THERE WHO WOULD SEE THIS AS AN

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.337
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU KNOW LARGE

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:32.640
MONEY GRABS TO DO I AM. THIS

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.275
KIND OF DEVELOPMENT I MEAN THERE

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.210
WAS AN ARTICLE JUST IN THE PAPER

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.312
I THINK LAST WEEK ABOUT A

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.314
DEVELOPER IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.283
ESSENTIALLY CHANGING THE ENTIRE

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:45.152
LANDSCAPE. OF A OF A

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:48.889
NEIGHBORHOOD- AND THEY HAVE THE

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.524
COULD THESE KINDS OF DEVELOPERS

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:54.695
ACTUALLY HAVE THE- CAPACITY AND

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.697
THE CAPITAL TO DO THIS BUT

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:58.499
THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE ONES WITH

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.234
THE BEST INTENTIONS AT HEART

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.403
ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A REDESIGN

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:06.774
OR BOLSTER OR INFUSE INTO

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.509
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.244
THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.312
MAKES SENSE THAT. DOUBLE IT

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:13.080
SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GREAT IDEA

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.382
AND I KNOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:17.885
TALKING ABOUT ADAPTIVE RE USE-

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:20.755
FOR A LONG TIME AND I WOULD HOPE

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:22.289
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:24.025
ADDITIONAL THOUGHT GIVEN TO THIS

01:34:24.091 --> 01:34:25.326
AND GUARDRAILS ABOUT LIKE WHAT

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:27.161
YOU ARE TRYING TO TARGET AND

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:29.864
WHILE YOU'RE OUT OUTCOMES WHAT

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:31.465
YOU WANT THE OUTCOMES TO LOOK

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:34.668
LIKE. BECAUSE THIS COULD HAVE

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:39.874
SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.643
RUSHING TO THE MICROPHONE SO I

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.445
THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO

PROJECT OVER THE LAST YEAR-

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.621
SINCE- SB ONE FIFTY SIX WAS

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:50.823

WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE RISK IF

01:59:08.407 --> 01:59:11.377
THERE MIGHT BE A NEED FOR A

01:59:11.444 --> 01:59:14.514
SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER- NETWORK

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.382

IN THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

01:59:36.469 --> 01:59:39.105
RANGE- JUST JUST IN TERMS OF

01:59:39.171 --> 01:59:41.107
INFLATION AND THEN IF YOU TAKE

01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:42.475
INTO ACCOUNT THE- THAT THE

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:45.244

EXCISE TAX OR COMPLEX WHICH IS

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:44.797
AN IDEAL BUT THE PROPOSAL

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:46.765
CLEARLY IS TRYING TO STRIKE A

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:47.733
CERTAIN BALANCE BETWEEN

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:50.035

EFFECTIVE AS STRUCTURED SO WE

02:07:05.584 --> 02:07:06.986
RECOMMEND REJECTING IT. THE

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:09.121

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.723
A LACK OF FUNDING TO DEVELOP A

02:07:10.789 --> 02:07:12.324
LICENSING PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:13.926
KEY REASONS WHY JURISDICTIONS DO

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:16.362
NOT ALLOW RETAIL CANNABIS. I

ABSURDITY. NOW ADMITTEDLY I DID

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.561
NOT SUPPORT LEGALIZATION. IT'S

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:34.032
HERE. BUT NOW WE HAVE A HUGE

02:09:34.099 --> 02:09:37.836

SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AND I DON'T

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:54.052

COMMUNITIES I SUPPORT THAT. BUT

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:04.563
THIS IS NOT THE ENTIRE ANSWER.

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:06.431
IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME AND

02:10:06.498 --> 02:10:07.432
CONVINCE ME THAT LET'S DO A FEW

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:10.169
THINGS ABOUT CRACKING DOWN ON

02:10:10.235 --> 02:10:14.106
THE ILLICIT MARKET. IT'S RAMPANT

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:15.440

ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. AND IF

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:35.227
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS THEN

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:37.162
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SIDE OF

02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:39.598
THE EQUATION. NOT FOCUSING ON

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:43.235
HELPING OUT THE LEGAL MARKET.

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:45.637
LET'S DO WHAT WE CAN THERE BUT

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.272
LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:50.075

BACK FROM FOLKS IN THE RETAIL

BUSINESS ABOUT THE CANNABIS

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:08.093
STRUCTURE THAT WE SET IN PLACE

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.895
WAS THAT THE- THAT THE BURDEN

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:13.498
THE LOAD THAT WE PLACE ON THEM.

02:11:13.565 --> 02:11:15.300
BOTH LOCALLY AND AT THE STATE

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:17.569
LEVEL WAS CAUSING THE PRICE OF

02:11:17.636 --> 02:11:20.172
THEIR PRODUCT TO BE SUCH THAT-

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.040
THEY WERE PRICED OUT OF THE

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:23.942

THIS CANNABIS TAX REFORM

02:11:29.681 --> 02:11:31.617
PROPOSAL SO IF WE SET THE

NINETEEN PERCENT. WHAT WHAT IS

02:11:39.324 --> 02:11:41.893

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:03.442
PEOPLE INTO THE MARKET. THAT'S

02:13:03.508 --> 02:13:04.509
ONE WAY WE CAN COMBAT THE

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:06.345
ILLICIT ACTIVITY. AND WE ALSO

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:08.313
ARE TRYING TO BE MINDFUL OF.

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.648
FUNDING FOR THOSE ALLOCATION

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:12.384
THREE PROGRAM SO THAT THE

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:12.884
CURRENT TAX RIGHT NOW.

02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:14.619
MOTIVATION IS ABOUT 4% AND

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:17.422
EXCISES 15% SO TOGETHER THAT'S

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:18.857
NINETEEN PERCENT. WERE ZEROING

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.425
OUT THE CULTIVATION SO THAT

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:23.161
LEAVES US AT 15% TO START THIS

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:24.896
PROJECT. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION

02:13:24.963 --> 02:13:26.264
IS PROPOSING A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:28.400
MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.736
BACK CELLS SO THE IDEA IS. IF

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.204
THE TAX RATE IS LOWER PERHAPS

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.739
PEOPLE WHO BUY MORE CANNABIS

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:35.240
OVER ALSO THE REVENUE WON'T

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:37.442
DEBT. BECAUSE THE TAX RATE

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.177
LOWERED IT WILL JUST SAY ABOUT

02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:40.345
THE SAME BECAUSE MORE CANNABIS

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:41.313
WILL BE PURCHASED MORE TAX

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:42.914
REVENUE WILL COME IN. IF THAT

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:44.549
DOESN'T TURN OUT TO BE THE CASE

02:13:44.616 --> 02:13:46.451
WE CAN SUPPORT THEM THE HUNDRED

02:13:46.518 --> 02:13:47.452
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:48.820
TIME GENERAL FUND. IF THAT STILL

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.922
DOESN'T GET THEM TO THE BASELINE

02:13:50.989 --> 02:13:53.692
THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD. MAKE AN

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:54.826
ADJUSTMENT IN THE EXCISE TAX

02:13:54.893 --> 02:13:57.129
RATES. AND THIS IS NICK WITH

02:13:57.195 --> 02:13:59.064
ARSENAL PRODUCT. ATTACKS IN TWO

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:01.600
MINISTRATION I MAKE. I JUST WANT

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:05.504
TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT'S NOT-NECESSARILY ABOUT. SELLING MORE

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:08.206
CANNABIS IT IS ABOUT. DRIVING

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:11.176
ACTIVITY. INTO THE LEGAL MARKET.

02:14:11.243 --> 02:14:13.211
AND WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE TAX

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:15.113
REFORM PROVISIONS HERE. WELL AS

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.681
THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS WITH

02:14:16.748 --> 02:14:17.716
SHRINK WHICH INCLUDED IN THIS

02:14:17.783 --> 02:14:20.118
PROPOSAL. WILL ALLOW US TO MUCH

02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:24.289
MORE EFFECTIVELY- GRAPPLE WITH-

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:25.824
THE ILLICIT MARKET I COMPLETELY

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:27.959
SHARED CENTER NEILSON'S.

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.495
CONCERNS AND- WE ARE DOING

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:32.497
EVERYTHING WE CAN I THINK THIS

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:36.234
PROPOSAL. WILL ALLOW US- THE

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.636
SIMPLIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM AS

02:14:37.702 --> 02:14:38.637
WELL AS TO THE ENFORCEMENT

02:14:38.703 --> 02:14:40.472
PROVISIONS AS WELL AS ALLOWING

02:14:40.539 --> 02:14:43.975
US TO. USE OUR SALES AND USE TAX

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:47.012
OUR RESOURCES AND COMBINE THEM

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:47.646
WITH OUR CAMPUS RESOURCES

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:50.949
BECAUSE NOW. IT WOULD BE AT THE-

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:52.918
RETAIL LEVEL SO THEY WOULD BOTH

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:54.753
BE SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS AS

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:56.621
WELL AS THE X. TAXPAYERS AS BY

02:14:56.688 --> 02:14:58.757
THE WAY. IS I MEAN THIS IS THE

02:14:58.824 --> 02:15:01.326
SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED AND

02:15:01.393 --> 02:15:05.163
VOTED ON IN PROP SIXTY FOUR SO I

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.198
THINK FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THIS

02:15:06.264 --> 02:15:07.799
IS A LOT OF SENSE AND WILL. TO-

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:09.901
COMBAT THE ILLICIT MARKET AND

02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:12.537
ALLOW THOSE- OPERATORS WHO ARE

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:15.073
TRYING TO PLAY BY THE RULES.

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.842
HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE SAYS.

02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:18.410
WHAT I LIKE THIS AND I COMMEND

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:20.712
YOU I COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION

02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:22.547
FOR CHANGING THE POINT OF

02:15:22.614 --> 02:15:24.216
COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE- AS

02:15:24.282 --> 02:15:25.617
YOU KNOW WE ALL WE'RE CONCERNED

02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:27.486
ABOUT THAT THE LAST TIME WE-

02:15:27.552 --> 02:15:30.155
CONVENE THAT THE RIVER TO HAVE A

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:31.957
CONVERSATION- I AM I'M STILL

02:15:32.023 --> 02:15:33.492
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS EXCISE

02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:35.494
TAX. INCREASE DECREASE BUSINESS

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.997
SO. THE CULTIVATION TAX WAS 4%

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:40.832
THE EXCISE TAXES FIFTEEN

02:15:40.899 --> 02:15:44.069
PERCENT. SO DO I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:15:44.135 --> 02:15:46.538
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE IT AT 15% ZERO

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:48.874
OUT THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND SEE

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.742
WHETHER IT DRIVES UP CANNABIS

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:53.078
SALES WHICH IN TURN IS REVENUE

02:15:53.144 --> 02:15:54.946
TO THE STATE THROUGH THE TAX.

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:56.848
AND IF IT DOES NOT THEN THE

02:15:56.915 --> 02:15:59.885
NIGHT THEN THE EXCISE TAX GOES

02:15:59.951 --> 02:16:03.488
BACK 219% YES THAT'S CORRECT AND

02:16:03.555 --> 02:16:05.590
AGAIN IT'S LEGAL CANNABIS SALES

02:16:05.657 --> 02:16:06.525
THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DRIVE

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:09.327
NO NO NO. NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND

02:16:09.394 --> 02:16:10.362
THAT. WHAT WHAT'S THAT IS THAT

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:12.430
IS THE THAT IS THE MOST

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:14.466
COMPROMISED THAT I THINK PEOPLE

02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:15.667
BEEN TRYING TO STRIKE IS LA-

02:16:15.734 --> 02:16:17.769
MENTIONED. I'M GOING TO STICK

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:21.006
THE ENDS OF THE FUNDING. AND THE

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:22.007
INDUSTRY AND- WELL I'M

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.475
FASCINATED BY THE BY THIS

02:16:23.542 --> 02:16:26.511
THOUGHT SO WE'RE DOING IT 15% TO

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:27.913
SEE IF IT INCREASES THE STAPLES

02:16:27.979 --> 02:16:29.881
IF IT DOESN'T OF LAWFUL LEGAL

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:32.317
CANNABIS. IF IT DOESN'T INCREASE

02:16:32.384 --> 02:16:34.052
THE SALES WERE GOING TO INCREASE

02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:36.021
THE EXCISE TAX TO NINETEEN

02:16:36.087 --> 02:16:39.524
PERCENT. WHICH WOULD PROBABLY IS

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:42.127
ASSUREDLY KEEP THE SALES LOW.

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:44.963
YOU MIGHT WRITE SENATE SENATOR

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:47.332
NIELSEN SAYS CHRISTINE WITH THE

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:49.367
L. AND JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE

02:16:49.434 --> 02:16:52.170
THINGS THE WAY IT IS DONE AT THE

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:53.204
OTHER END THIS IS ROUGH I'M

02:16:53.271 --> 02:16:55.840
SORRY SORRY SORRY. SENATOR RON

02:16:55.907 --> 02:17:00.111
AND HE WAITED TRAILER BILL IS

02:17:00.178 --> 02:17:03.748
CONSTRUCTED THE DEFAULT SO AS A

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:06.985
DIRECTOR ELLIOT NEWBY THE-

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:08.954
RETAIL EXCISE TAX WOULD REMAIN

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:12.257
AT FIFTEEN PERCENT FOR- THROUGH

02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:15.594
THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.228
TWENTY THREE AND THEN STARTING

02:17:17.295 --> 02:17:20.231
ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:22.567
FOUR THE DEFAULT- EXCISE TAX

02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:24.402
RATE IN THE STATUTE WOULD BE

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:25.804
NINETEEN PERCENT. THERE IS A

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:27.973
PROCESS ARTICULATED IN THE

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:29.541
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THROUGH

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:31.576
WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IN

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:34.179
PARTICULAR CD TFA IN CONJUNCTION

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:36.114
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:39.384
COULD LOWER THE RATE BELOW 19%

02:17:39.451 --> 02:17:42.320
AS LOW AS FIFTEEN PERCENT. BUT

02:17:42.387 --> 02:17:44.356
THE WAY THE WAY THE TRAILER BILL

02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:45.557
LANGUAGE IS PHRASED IT GIVES

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:49.127
THEM THE OPTION TO DO THAT UNDER

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:50.161
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NO NO

02:17:50.228 --> 02:17:52.631
REQUIREMENT TO DO SO I JUST

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:53.798
STRICTER TO CLARIFY THE

02:17:53.865 --> 02:18:13.251
STRUCTURE AND THAT WOULD BE.

02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:22.293
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE FROM

02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:31.069
JANUARY FOR.

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:33.171
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:34.673
ENHANCING OURENFORCEMENT

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.675
EFFORTS ON THOSE THAT ARE

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:38.043
ENGAGED IN THE ILLEGAL

02:18:38.109 --> 02:18:41.513
OPERATION- IT. IN THE CANNABIS

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:44.949
SPACE SO ONE QUESTION ON THAT

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:47.318
SCORE THE ANALYSIS SAYS. THE

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:48.486
CHANGES INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.288
POLICIES TO INCREASE TAX

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:52.323
COMPLIANCE AND COLLECTION AS

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.426
WELL AS LABOR STANDARDS. THEN

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:57.062
SAVE THOSE POLICIES NOT FUNDING

02:18:57.128 --> 02:19:00.165
DO YOU RENT DO YOU ANTICIPATE.

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:02.400
GETTING TO THIS FUNDING ON THE

02:19:02.467 --> 02:19:05.070
ENFORCEMENT SIDE TO ENHANCE

02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:06.638
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY WITH

02:19:06.705 --> 02:19:08.606
RESPECT TO THE ILLEGAL

02:19:08.673 --> 02:19:10.575
OPERATIONS WHETHER THOSE ARE

02:19:10.642 --> 02:19:17.449
GROWS OR SHOPS DISPENSARIES. I'D

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:19.784
BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT ON THE TAX

02:19:19.851 --> 02:19:21.619
SIDE- WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING

02:19:21.686 --> 02:19:24.155
MUCH LESS THAN ARE WE ALLOWED TO

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:27.125
SPEND OUR TAX SIDE AND FRANKLY.

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.893
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD USE A

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.228
LITTLE MORE RESOURCES UNDER THE

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:31.329
CURRENT LAW WHAT THIS DOES

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:33.331
INCLUDE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:36.201
ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS- WHICH

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:37.502
ARE NOT ANYTHING EARTH

02:19:37.569 --> 02:19:38.903
SHATTERING THEY JUST SIMPLY

02:19:38.970 --> 02:19:41.005
ALIGN THE CANNABIS LAWS. FRANKLY

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:42.507
MORE WITH OUR SALES AND USE TAX

02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:44.609
LAWS BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE HAVE

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.544
MORE TEETH IN SALES AND USE TAX

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:49.914
WERE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW MORE

02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:52.117
AGGRESSIVELY GO AFTER- UNLIMITED

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:55.386
TAX FROM A- B. MARTIN WE ARE

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:57.589
FROM THE END OF THIS- BUSINESS.

02:19:57.655 --> 02:20:03.261
WHICH YOU KNOW IT IT'S- THAT

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:04.662
WE'RE HAVING. I STILL HAVING IT

02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:06.931
LOOK. PROVIDES A SOME OF THE

02:20:06.998 --> 02:20:08.199
TOOLS WE CURRENTLY HAVEN'T- TAX

02:20:08.266 --> 02:20:12.570
COLLECTION SO I THINK. WITH

02:20:12.637 --> 02:20:13.905
THESE PROVISIONS WE CAN ALSO AS

02:20:13.972 --> 02:20:14.839
I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER

02:20:14.906 --> 02:20:16.407
COMMENTS WE HAVE YOU KNOW

02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:17.609
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:19.444
WORKING ON SALES AND USE TAX

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:20.345
THESE SAME TAXPAYERS WHO WILL

02:20:20.411 --> 02:20:23.348
NOW BE. TAXPAYERS HERE ARE OUR

02:20:23.414 --> 02:20:26.384
SALES AND USE TAX PAYERS-

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:28.953
CURRENTLY AND SO I THINK WE'LL

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:29.554
BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THAT AND

02:20:29.621 --> 02:20:31.523
MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY DO THIS

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:32.624
WITHOUT A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF

02:20:32.690 --> 02:20:35.827
NEW RESOURCES IF THERE ARE-

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:37.595
RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AS- AS WE

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:39.364
IMPLEMENT THIS WE WILL CERTAINLY

02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:40.932
COME BACK BUT I. DON'T

02:20:40.999 --> 02:20:43.735
ANTICIPATE. TO RESOURCE ISSUE AT

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.637
THE MOMENT ON THE TAX SIDE AS

02:20:45.703 --> 02:20:48.807
MUCH AS IT IS A- YOU KNOW THE

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:52.110
POLICY- INSTRUCTIONS ATTACKS AS

02:20:52.177 --> 02:20:53.745
WELL AS SOME OF THE LAX

02:20:53.812 --> 02:20:55.146
ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS ARE

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:56.714
REALLY HAMPERING OUR EFFORTS

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.616
WELL I NEED IT PERHAPS IT'S THE

02:20:58.683 --> 02:21:01.553
LACK OF RESOURCES OR SOMETHING

02:21:01.619 --> 02:21:03.421
ELSE ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE.

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:04.722
WELL AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:06.291

MARKET. THAT IS GOING TO BE

02:23:35.873 --> 02:23:38.509
BASED ON THE COST. OF THE

STARTING UP THE RETAIL BUSINESS

02:23:44.182 --> 02:23:47.185

IF WE INCREASE THE TAXES MORE.

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:25.729
