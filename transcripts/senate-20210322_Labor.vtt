MINIMUM WAGE. I DO HAVE TWO

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:03.713
QUESTIONS- AND I THINK THE

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.249
ACTUALLY TOUCHED ON EACH. ONE

IT'S REGARDING EXISTING LAW SO

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.053
THE ASSERTION WAS MADE THAT THE

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.721
EXISTING LAWS RESULT OF

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.289
RELATIVELY RECENT PRIOR CHANGES

00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:15.191

COMMISSION WITH TOOLS

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:19.095
SUFFICIENT TO PUNISH AND DETER

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.663
BAD ACTORS IN THE GARMENT

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.399
SPACE. SO AT LEAST FOR THE

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:24.901
RECORD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.369
ON THE LOGIC OF YOUR BILL THIS

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:29.572
IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE WOULD

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:31.641

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:34.944

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.367
WE'RE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.936
TODAY- SO UNLESS THERE'S A

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.938
DIFFERENT BILL I GUESS IN IN

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.439

THOUGHT WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:24.661
OF THE PROBLEM AND IT DID FOR A

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:27.730
FEW YEARS UNTIL- EMPLOYERS

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.299
BEGAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.301
LOOPHOLES AND WE STARTED BACK

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:34.203
DOWN THE ROAD OF A VOID IN

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.472
THIS- IT IS NOT A MATTER OF

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:40.343
JUST- ENFORCING THE LAW WE HAVE

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:43.379
TO GIVE THE TOOLS FOR THE LABOR

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.648

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:52.221

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:55.358
UPSTREAM THE LIABILITY. ONE

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.727

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.134
WITHOUT BEING TOLD HERE'S A

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.602
PIECE RATE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.905
SHOULD FOLLOW UP BUT PRIMARILY

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.908
IT'S ABOUT FIGHTING FINDING-

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.711
GETTING LIABILITY FROM THE

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:18.681

THE- THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.229
LOOKING FOR AND IT'S JUST

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.565
SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY SO WE'RE

01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:37.166

HAVE TO WATCH ALL ONE THOUSAND

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.120
EPISODES BUT YOU KNOW VERY

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:35.358
SUCCESSFUL BRANDS AND LICENSED

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.459
TO A FARE THEE WELL. BY THAT

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.994
LICENSURE HAS A VERY LIMITED.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.929
AMOUNT OF INSIDER LEVERAGE ON

LICENSEES WHO SIMPLY. YOU KNOW

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:44.600

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.602
KNOW PROCEED TO CONTRACT OUT.

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.471

FIRMS. MADE THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.688
I THINK THE NATURAL RESPONSE-

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.590
GIVEN THE LIABILITY CREATED SO.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:08.458
IT YOU KNOW IS THERE ANY

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.159
THINKING TO TIGHTEN UP THE

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.527
DEFINITION OR GIVE SOME

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:16.599
CONSIDERATION THAT FACT. OUT OF

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:17.100
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO THAT

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.835
POSSIBILITY- SIR NEWMAN WE'D BE

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.403

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.772
THAT ANYBODY'S REACHED- RAISE

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:26.209
THIS ISSUE- LAST YEAR THE BILL.

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.611
CAME CLOSE WE WERE AT WE HIT

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.379
THE DEADLINE THE TIMING OF IT

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:31.848
OR I'M SURE IT WOULD'VE IT

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.817
WOULD'VE GONE ALL THE WAY- SO.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:35.985
YOU KNOW AT YOUR REQUEST TO BE

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.787
GLAD TO LOOK AT IT BUT I JUST

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.555
WANT TO REMIND US THAT. WE

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.957
DON'T WANT TO CUT BY FIXING

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.059
THAT. IN THE EYES OF SOME

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.027
COMPANIES WE DON'T WANT TO THEN

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.063
CREATE ANOTHER LEGAL LOOPHOLE

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.333
WHICH COULD BE USED- BY OTHERS

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.368
AND IT. YOU KNOW MY ONLY

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.070
CONCERN IS CREATING A WHOLE NEW

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.939
LAYER. OF CONTRACTING OUT- SO

01:02:57.006 --> 01:03:00.243
THAT'S ONE AND ALSO THERE ARE.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.411
COMPANIES WHO HAVE. WHO WOULD

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:06.315
DO. A FUNCTION AS A LICENSE OR-

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:08.017
THEY ALSO CAN TAKE A WE'RE NOT

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.785
INCLUDING THAT HERE BUT- THEY

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:12.155
CAN TAKE THEIR OWN ACTIONS. OF

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:13.689
THE COULD CONTRACT WITH YOU

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.892
KNOW ETHICAL GARMENT

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.793
MANUFACTURERS THEY COULD ENTER

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.197
INTO INDEMNITY CLAUSES- IN

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.633
CASE. YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:26.836
PAY- THE PROPER WAGES AND WAGE

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:30.139
AND HOUR. OF A REQUIREMENTS SO

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.140
I THINK THERE ARE THINGS THAT

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.042
CAN BE DONE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.077
TO REQUIRE. THE PROBLEM IS IF

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.445
WE HAVE TO STEP IN EVERY SINGLE

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:38.281
TIME THERE'S A NEW LOOPHOLE

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:39.849
CREATED OR THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:42.151
OF CREATE A NEW LOOPHOLE. SO

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:44.353
I'LL BE GLAD TO. GET BACK WITH

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.088
RIGHT I APPRECIATE ON FURTHER

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.291
ON FURTHER- THOUGHT ON OUR PART

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.825
I DO APPRECIATE SO UNITS OF THE

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:52.094
ARMY HERE IS THAT. IT IS WE THE

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:52.762
LEGISLATION THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:55.164
CREATING THIS NEW CONCEPT BY

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.532
THE DEFINITION ABOUT BRAND

01:03:56.599 --> 01:04:01.904
LICENSED. BRAND GUARANTOR. SO

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:02.905
IMPROV WORTH CONSIDERING THE

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.507
INPUT FOR THE ON A TEN

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:05.107
CONSEQUENCE SO I. IT WILL BE

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:10.479
SUPPORTED TO. THANK YOU. EIGHTY

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:11.747
FURTHER DISCUSSION OF COMMON

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.349
FROM THE COMMITTEE MMHM NUMBER

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:16.986
I SURE. SO I HAVE TO SAY THE

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:21.457
BOTH MY GROW. THAT WERE AT. I

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.758
GUESS YOU COULD SAY THE BABY

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.894
CLOTHING THEY SELL CLOTHING FOR

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.295
A WHILE MY FAQ I'M JUST MEASURE

CLOTHING AND MY GRANDFATHER

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.534
WOULD TAKE IT INTO THE CITY TO

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.003
SELL IT IN MEXICO SO- AND I

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.605
WORKED AS A IN A TAILOR SHOP

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.139
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.641
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:39.809
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:42.211
NOT BEING PAID THEIR WAGES-

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.480
THAT IS JUST A HORRIBLE THING

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.881
ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA-

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.116
BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.018
CONCERNS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.754
CURRENTLY. MINIMUM WAGE-

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.990
REQUIREMENTS OR MANDATES IN IN

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:58.628
THE STATE. AND- WOULD IT BE AND

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:00.263
THIS IS JUST I'M TRYING TO

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.464
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.099
MY IN MY VIEW MY PERSPECTIVE

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.101
THIS IS AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.069
BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:08.938
BAD ACTORS RIGHT THERE WHO ARE

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.506
NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW. AM I

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:15.511
CORRECT. YES OKAY SO. AND HELP

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.980
AND HELP EDUCATE ME ON THIS AND

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:20.082
WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENFORCING

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.451
THESE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS SO THAT

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.820
PEOPLE GET PAID WELL THERE'S AN

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:28.124
LABOR AGENCY- WHERE YOU CAN GO

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.826
AND FILE A COMPLAINT- WHAT WE

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:34.130
HAVE FOUND IS AND YOU HEARD-

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.365
MUCH F THE OF THE TESTIMONY

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:38.868
ONE WOMAN WHO COMPLAINED FIRST

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.202
TO HER EMPLOYER BROUGHT IT TO

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.570
THE ATTENTION TO IMPORTANT SO

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.506
YOU'RE NOT PAYING ME MINIMUM

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:46.809
WAGE- AND HE PROMISES TO. PAY

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.110
THE MINIMUM WAGE PAY HER

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.779
ACCURATELY AND THEN SHE COMES

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:50.913
IN TO WORK THE FOLLOWING WEEK

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:52.548
AND THEY CLOSE DOWN SO THIS

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.217
INDUSTRY IS FULL OF THESE VERY

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.753
VERY SMALL AND- COMPANIES THEY

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.622
CAN JUST CLOSE DOWN AND THEN

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.657
THE FOLLOWING WEEK SHOW UP YOU

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:04.193
KNOW NEXT DOOR UNDER A NEW NAME

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.164
AND SO THIS WEB OF CONTRACTORS-

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.166
IS THE FIRST YOU KNOW HUGE

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:12.201
PROBLEM AND THE SECOND IS THAT

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.869
YOU GO UP UPSTREAM WITH THESE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.072
COMPANIES WHO ORDER OR WHO ARE

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.474
CONNECTED WITH THE PRODUCT THAT

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:20.443
THEY'RE MAKING. AND THEY'RE NOT

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.511
TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:26.182
THEY'D KNOWN MANY TIMES THAT

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.184
THEY'RE NOT PAYING. THE ADDED.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.886
TO THAT COMPANY. TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.088
MAKE A PROFIT AND THEN PAY

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.923
THEIR WORKERS BUT WHAT THEY

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.891
GIVE TO THAT THOSE CONTRACTORS

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.828
IS SO LOW. THAT THAT CONTRACTOR

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.897
COULD NEVER REALLY. GET A

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:44.266
PROFIT WITHOUT- CHEATING THE

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.301
WORKERS FROM THEIR MINIMUM

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.803
WAGE. SIR MANY WAYS IN WHICH

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:51.140
THIS UP THE SYSTEM HAS LED TO

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.908
THESE WORKERS NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:53.843
GET THE WAGES THAT THEY

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.579
DESERVE. SO WE HAVE TO COME IN

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:59.014
AND CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES SO THAT

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.649
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE WORKERS

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.318
CHEATED OUT OF THEIR WAGES. I

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.819
WAS ON SUBCOMMITTEE THE REASON

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.988
I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS AS I WAS

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.723
ON THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.725
THAT PHAM OVERSAW THIS A

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.161
RESTITUTION FUND AND I WAS JUST

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:14.263
SHOCKED THAT THERE WAS WORKER

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.132
AFTER WORKER AFTER WORKER AT

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:18.467
THAT TIME WHO WOULD SHOW UP-

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:21.704
AND SAYING- I GOT MY COMPLAIN

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.839
MY CASE WAS ADJUDICATED. AND I

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:26.008
HAVEN'T STILL HAVEN'T BEEN PAID

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.977
FOR ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS. SO

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:30.746
IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.681
EITHER FROM THE WORKERS OR FROM

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:35.017
THE LABOR AGENCY IT'S JUST THAT

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:37.953
IT'S SO RAMPANT AND THEY NEED

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.556
TO HOLD. SOMEBODY HIGHER UP ON

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:43.225
THE CHAIN RESPONSIBLE OR ELSE

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.294
WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE CHASING

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.029
OUR TAILS AND NOT REALLY

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:49.031
SOLVING THE PROBLEM. SO WOULD

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.666
YOU TAKE THAT LOGIC IN GO ONE

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.270
FURTHER STEP UP AND SAY THAT

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:54.870
THE CONSUMERS AND THE STORES.

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:57.039
SHOULD BE PENALIZED WELL. HELD

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.774
ACCOUNTABLE AS A PENALIZED

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.309
ACCOUNTABLE NO BECAUSE NOPE I

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:01.944
DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:02.778
THE ONES BUYING THE PRODUCT

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:04.780
THEY'RE NOT HAVING IN. ASKING

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:08.884
FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE MADE.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:15.324
OKAY- MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.861
WE'RE- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.696
BE ABLE TO ENFORCE WHAT YOUR

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.999
INTENT IS IF WE CAN'T ENFORCE

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:26.869
THE MINIMUM WAGE. REQUIREMENT

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.838
IN CALIFORNIA WITH THESE PEOPLE

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.073
WITH THESE COMPANIES THESE-

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.542
WOULD YOU CALL IT UNETHICAL

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:37.146
EMPLOYERS- I'M TRYING TO

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:39.014
UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.649
BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THIS WITH

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:43.586
THIS BILL. WHAT WE AGAIN WE

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:46.155
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT EVEN IF

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.857
YOU'RE HIGHER UP IN THE CHAIN

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.726
THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE- AND

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.728
SECOND IS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.297
THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE. PAYING

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:57.132
THE WAGES THAT ARE PAYING THE

01:08:57.199 --> 01:08:59.134
OF ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW AND

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.636
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:01.704
BECAUSE IF WE KEEP LETTING

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.339
THESE OTHER BUSINESSES GET AWAY

UNFORTUNATE MASS OF. WHAT

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.109
APPEARS TO BE A MASSIVE AMOUNT

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:43.411
OF FRAUD BASED ON THE AUDITOR'S

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:45.480

WITH YOUR- WITH YOUR BILL. BY

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:54.756
THE CONCEPT IN THE BILL EVENTS

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:58.093
THAT WOULD BE. COST RECOVERY-

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.794
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.429
THOSE METRICS LOOK LIKE IN

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:03.098
TERMS OF WHAT IT'S REALLY GOING

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:05.567
TO TAKE A- I KNOW YOU HAVE A

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.969
BACKGROUND- YOUR SOFA IN THE

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.008
WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE WE MIGHT BE

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:13.608
LOOKING AT SOME POINT IN TERMS

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:18.213
OF SCALE. SO- FIRST ANY

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.714
ORGANIZED EFFORT AND THIS IS A

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.750
COMPLEX EFFORT TO ORGANIZE

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:23.418
NEEDS ONE PERSON OR ENTITY IN

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.386
CHARGE AND THAT'S THE FIRST

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.555
PRINCIPLE THE SECOND PRINCIPLES

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.390
IS FOR THEM TO ASSESS WHAT IS

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.225
IT WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:30.825
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A VERY

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.328
LARGE ROLE TO PLAY- AND SO I

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:34.763
WOULD EXPECT THAT THIS TASK

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.698
FORCE WITH THE AG IN CHARGE

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:37.799
WOULD FIRST DO AN ASSESSMENT

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:38.700
WHAT DO WE THINK WE CAN

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:39.801
REASONABLY RECOVER I'VE HEARD

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.836
DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OF ONE

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.171
ESTIMATE IS BASED THINK WE CAN

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:45.740
RECOVER 10% OF THE FRAUD WELL.

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.676
IF IT'S TEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.843
THAT'S BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.479
THAT'S ACTUAL MONEY- AND WHAT

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:52.981
RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.783
REQUIRED IN AN OLD NEED TO BE A

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:57.452
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SO IF FOR

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.486
EXAMPLE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.722
SPEND TICKET NUMBER TEN MILLION

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:01.990
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:03.225
PROSECUTORIAL INVESTIGATIVE

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:05.160
RESOURCES IN ORDER TO RECOVER

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.228
BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A PRETTY

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:08.230
GOOD INVESTMENT- BUT WE DON'T

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.497
KNOW RIGHT NOW IN THAT AND

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.498
THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.600
THE BILL SO WE CAN GET

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.435
OURSELVES ORGANIZED AND DO THE

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.437
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. AND THEN

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.205
HOUSING CONTEMPLATED THAT THE

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.873
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WOULD

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.844
COME BACK WITH A B. BACK TO THE

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:24.279
LEGISLATURE OR- WHO IS A TASK

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.315
FORCE IN REPORT. SO CLEARLY IF

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:28.817
ANY ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE

01:21:28.883 --> 01:21:30.819
REQUIRED. THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:33.855
THE AG OR- WHATEVER ENTITY IS

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.056
CREATED WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.559
TO THE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:40.028
ASK THE THAT THAT BE FUNDED SO-

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:42.030
THAT WE WILL BE RELATIVELY

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:44.466
SHORT LEASH ON US. BUT WE NEED

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:45.867
IN MY VIEW WE NEED WE NEED TO

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:48.236
GET STARTED. FIGURING ALL THIS

01:21:48.303 --> 01:21:50.639
OUT OF THE MONEY THAT WAS

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:53.174
STOLEN- IS BEING QUICKLY

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.576
DISSIPATED AND TO THE EXTENT

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.611
THAT THAT- WE TAKE TOO MUCH

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:59.881
TIME- WE'RE WE'RE LOSING MONEY.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:02.384

EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:22.597
RECOVERY IT WOULD BE MY VIEW

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.765
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.533

IF WE CAN RECOVER 10% THAT

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.688
WOULD BE GREAT. YES IT'S

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.022
GETTING HARDER AND HARDER AND

WE'VE NOT RECOVERED MUCH WE

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.059
DON'T HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT

THIS MONEY I EXPECT IS PROBABLY

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.636
OVERSEAS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO

THEM AND- I JUST THINK THAT-

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:52.426
FOR US. COMPLETELY WRONG

03:32:52.493 --> 03:32:54.728
BECAUSE IT'S PRO WORKING MEN

03:32:54.795 --> 03:32:56.830
AND WOMEN WHO TAKE THOSE RISK

03:32:56.897 --> 03:32:58.932
OF GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AND

03:32:58.999 --> 03:33:00.734
THEY'RE GETTING SICK AND IF WE

03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:04.505
HAVE EMPLOYERS WHO SEE WHO SEEM

03:33:04.571 --> 03:33:06.473
TO THINK THAT THEY COULD IGNORE

03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:08.842
THAT AND- COMMIT REALLY

03:33:08.909 --> 03:33:11.578
EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH

03:33:11.645 --> 03:33:13.680
AND SAFETY DURING A PANDEMIC. I

03:33:13.747 --> 03:33:15.983
THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL I JUST

03:33:16.049 --> 03:33:17.751
THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL

03:33:17.818 --> 03:33:21.655
AND TO SAY SOMEHOW. THAT BY-

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:24.758
HOLDEN THESE ARE THE EMPLOYERS

03:33:24.825 --> 03:33:26.660
TO COMMIT THESE ACTIONS IN A

03:33:26.727 --> 03:33:29.396
VERY NARROW WAY THAT SOMEHOW

03:33:29.463 --> 03:33:31.198
WE'RE ANTI BUSINESS I THINK IS.

03:33:31.265 --> 03:33:33.467
IS REALLY TWISTING THE WHOLE

03:33:33.534 --> 03:33:36.069
NOTION THAT YOU CAN BE PRO

03:33:36.136 --> 03:33:38.238
BUSINESS BUT PRO BOWL HEALTH

03:33:38.305 --> 03:33:40.374
AND SAFETY ON THE JOB OF THESE

03:33:40.440 --> 03:33:41.942
WORKING MEN AND WOMEN JUST PUT

03:33:42.009 --> 03:33:44.011
YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION WE

03:33:44.077 --> 03:33:45.612
HAVE TO GO TO WORK AND WE DON'T

03:33:45.679 --> 03:33:47.214
HAVE ALL THESE PROTECTIONS WE

03:33:47.281 --> 03:33:48.815
DON'T HAVE ALL THESE TESTS WE

03:33:48.882 --> 03:33:50.317
DON'T HAVE ALL THESE THINGS

03:33:50.384 --> 03:33:52.019
THAT ALLOW US TO COME IN. AND

03:33:52.085 --> 03:33:54.788
FEEL SAFE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF

03:33:54.855 --> 03:33:57.491
