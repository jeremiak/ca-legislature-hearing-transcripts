AND WILDLIFE -- GENDER -- TO TUESDAY APRIL THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I'M ASK -- AS A MEMBER QUIRK IT'LL COME FOR WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THAT TAKE UP THE FIRST ISSUE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. UP FIRST ARM IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IT SAYS CONSIDERATIONS. YOU OFFER MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO RE AUTHORIZE AN AD CALIFORNIA. TO THE NUTRIA EDUCATE RATIFICATION AND CONTROL ACT OF TWO THOUSAND THREE AND IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO DO THAT -- IN THE SENATE [inaudible] OKAY. I'M A ARE A REQUEST TO CONGRESS AT CALIFORNIA. TO PROVISIONS THE NEUTRAL CONTROL NUTRIA CONTROL ACT. AND RE AUTHORIZED AN APPROPRIATION TO CALIFORNIA. TO RATHER KATE NUTRIA -- WITH AN AMOUNT OF FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OUR LARGE QUANTIC RODENTS THAT HAVE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED AN INVASIVE PRESENCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE RAPID POPULATION GROWTH. GROWTH RAPIDLY STRIPS WETLANDS OF VEGETATION. TRANSFORMING BURDEN MARTIAN TO OPEN WATER BEYOND HABITAT DESTRUCTION NUTRI HABITUALLY BAR AND TO LEVEES AND RIVER BANKS THREATENING THEIR STABILITY. AJ ARE EIGHT SEEKS TO BRING THE SAME PROGRAM TO SUCCESSFULLY ERADICATED NUTRIA IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY CALIFORNIA. TESTIFYING WITH ME TODAY IS VALERIE COOK FLETCHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. INCREASED ANDERSON FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ACCRA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. IF YOU MENTION MY NAME IS VALERIE COOK FLETCHER I'M A SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS SUPERVISOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S INVASIVE SPECIES PROGRAM AND SERVING AS THE NUTRIA REVOCATION INCIDENT COMMANDER WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE NUTRIENT VISION IN CALIFORNIA IT'S IMPACTS. AND THE RESPONSE EFFORTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA. AS HE MENTIONED NUTRI WERE DISCOVERED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A PREGNANT FEMALE WITHIN MERCED COUNTY OVER THE NEXT YEAR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY ANIMALS WERE DISCOVERED FROM SAN JOAQUIN. STANISLAUS MERCED FRESNO MARIPOSA INTO ON THE COUNTIES -- NUTRIA RODENTS THEY REPRODUCE EARLY AND OFTEN AND AS HE MENTIONED -- THEY'RE ABLE TO RAPIDLY EXPAND BOTH OUR POPULATION SIZE AND THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION WE ESTIMATE THAT WITH THE SOURCE POPULATION OF FIFTY ANIMALS WITHOUT INTERVENING CONTROL EFFORTS. FOR FIVE YEARS TIME THAT POPULATION COULD BECOME. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND ANIMALS. THESE ANIMALS LIVE IN COLONIES TYPICALLY OF A DOMINANT MALE AND MULTIPLE REPRODUCING FEMALES. THAT TO DRIVE OUT MATURING JUVENILES WHICH CAN DISPERSE AS FAR AS FIFTY MILES SO THAT IS A RAPID EXPANSION BOTH IN POPULATION SIZE AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. THE FEEDING AND BURROWING ACTIVITIES OF NUTRIA BECAUSE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA -- INCLUDING LOSS OF DESIRABLE VEGETATION DEGRADATION OF VALUABLE HABITAT FOR WATERFOWL ANOTHER WELL AND I LOOK AT SPECIES. EXACERBATIONS OF INVASIVE PLANT POPULATIONS AND ALSO LOSS OF OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER THE HOLES TOGETHER ARE WETLAND SOILS. FURTHER -- AND WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE TO SPEAK TO IMPACTS INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THEY'RE BORROWING ACTIVITY ALSO CAUSES SEVERE EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION WHICH IMPACTS -- SELMON IT'S WITHIN THE DELTA TRIBUTARY THAT RELY ON THOSE SYSTEMS FOR SPAWNING. FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY OF NUTRIA IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE INSTITUTED AN INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM. RE DIRECTING STAFF RESOURCES AND FUNDING TO PLAN COORDINATE AND INITIATE A RATIFICATION EFFORTS WITHIN THE STATE. WELL THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WORKS INTERNALLY TO SURVEY FOR NUTRIA PRESENTS AND TRAP KNOWN INFESTATIONS ALONGSIDE OUR CONTRACTOR WILDLIFE SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IS ALSO CONDUCTING -- DELIMITATION SURVEYS AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE INFESTATION TO HELP US DETERMINE THE FULL GEOGRAPHIC EXTENT OF THE INFESTATION. TODAY THE DEPARTMENT HAS OBTAINED OVER TWENTY NEARLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LANDOWNER PERMITS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS PRIVATE PROPERTIES FOR SURVEYS ENTRAPPING WE'VE ASSESSED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND ACRES FOR NUTRI PRESENTS ARE HABITAT SUITABILITY. WE'VE CONFIRM TO THEIR THEIR PRESENCE IN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR LOCATIONS AND HAVE NOW REMOVED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN NUTRIA FROM THE STATE. IN SUMMER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH THE ANTICIPATED FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WELL AS AN IMPENDING DELTA CONSERVANCY GRANT WE ANTICIPATE TRANSITIONING FROM THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM INTO A FORMAL DEDICATED DEPARTMENT PROGRAM. TO IMPLEMENT A RATIFICATION OVER THE LONG TERM. THAT PROGRAM WILL SEE EXPANSION OF FIELD OPERATIONS INTEGRATION OF ADDITIONAL PROJECT COMPONENTS INCLUDING JUDAS NUTRIA AND SENT DETECTION DOGS. AND WILL CONTINUE OVER THE LONG TERM UNTIL SUCCESSFUL -- EDUCATION IS ACHIEVED. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- EARLY RAPID RESPONSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH RE DIRECTED DEPARTMENT FUNDING AND SHORT TERM GRANTS FROM THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA CONSERVANCY IN THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AKEL REPRESENTS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES WHICH TOGETHER ACCOUNT 490% OF THE WATER DELIVERED IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS RELY ON AN EXTENSIVE SYSTEM OF CANALS DIKES AND DAMS TO MEET THE AGRICULTURAL MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOWEVER NUTRIA THREATEN THE INTEGRITY OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE SAT IN THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE DELTA THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT'S SUPPLIES WATER TO TWENTY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND IRRIGATES THREE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. THREE SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF CANALS TUNNELS AND PIPELINES. ADDITIONALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT PROVIDES AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES. NUTRI ARE ALREADY WIDESPREAD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'VE BEEN DETECTED IN THE SOUTHERN DELTA. THE EXISTENCE IN SPREADING NUTRIENT CALIFORNIA CAN DAMAGE CAN FAN CONVEYANCE FACILITIES AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ADDITIONALLY THEY ARE KNOWN TO CARRY HEALTH HAZARDS WHICH COULD CONTAMINATE WATER SUPPLIES. YEAH ABSOLUTELY BERMAN SO THAT I CAN [inaudible] FOR EDUARDO GARCIA [inaudible] GALLAGHER BIGELOW [inaudible] CHOI [inaudible] CHIU [inaudible] TO I'VE DALY [inaudible] FRIEDMAN CRISTINA GARCIA. GLORIA KALRA LEVINE BLANCA RUBIO SALAS WOOD. THE MOVE THE BILL OKAY. THE MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND THAT BOTHERS FOR IN ROUGHLY PLEASE PROCEED YOU DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND OKAY THANK CAL BE BRIEF -- NUTRI COULD UNDOUBTEDLY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS INCLUDING LOTS OF WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD CONTROL CAPACITY FORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN THAT IN MARYLAND THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN SUCCESSFULLY RADICALLY NUTRIA. IS NECESSARY TO BRING THIS COLLABORATIVE MULTI PRONGED EFFORT TO CALIFORNIA AJ ARE EIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM. WATER SUPPLY AND FRAGILE ECOLOGY OF THE DELTA OCKLEY PARKWAY STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING NO WELL KRAMER'S OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT OF THE WORK IN MARYLAND TO RADIC KATE NUTRIA WAS NOT EASY BUT IT WAS MUCH EASIER THAN IT WILL BE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A SINGLE LANDOWNER THAT THEY HAD. TO WORK WITH IN CALIFORNIA WORDS MUCH MORE COMPLEX BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY MORE LAND OWNERS AND SO THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- REQUESTED IN AG ARE EIGHT IT WILL BE IMPERATIVE TO BEING SIX TO A SUCCESSFUL REPLICATION PROGRAM THANK YOU. THOSE WISHING -- TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING BY THE TIME SOME OF METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING BETH A LOSS ON BEHALF OF THE INLAND EMPIRE UTILITIES AGENCY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPEN. ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE WILL BRING BACK ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE SOME MEMBER. SO HOW DO THEY GET FROM STATE TO STATE AND DO NOT LEAVE THAT TO FISHING GAME THAT. WE BELIEVE THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL REINTRODUCTION. THE THE REASONS BEHIND THAT WE'RE NOT YET SHORE BUT AND WE MAY NEVER BE SURE BUT I SUSPECT IT WAS EITHER INTRODUCTION. FOR RECREATIONAL HUNTING OR POTENTIALLY FOR THE BELIEF THAT THEY WOULD CONTROL -- INVASIVE PLANT POPULATIONS IN IN AREAS WITH SEVERE INFESTATIONS OF WATER HYACINTH FOR EXAMPLE. SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] PLEASE. CLEAR FOR YOU SAID A RE INTRODUCTION. HOW TO DEFINE THAT FOR SO WE BETTER UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY HERE PREVIOUSLY THESE ANIMALS ARE NATIVE TO SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA THEY WERE INTRODUCED TO NORTH AMERICA FOR THE FOR TRADE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS? THEY WERE FORMED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES BUT ONCE THE FOR MARKET COLLAPSED. ON THESE ANIMALS THERE WERE ESCAPES ANIMALS WERE RELEASED WE HAD FERAL POPULATIONS IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THEY WERE THEN SUBSEQUENTLY DECLARED A RADIC AIDED IN THE SEVENTIES WITH NO DETECTIONS BUT FROM THE SEVENTIES. UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO THEY WERE BROUGHT HERE FOR A FOR MARKET. AND WE HAVE LEGISLATION TO PROTECT [inaudible] FOR CREATURES. THAT PUTS DOT ORIGIN. I UNDERSTAND THAT NUTRIA HAS BEEN. ELIMINATED FROM THAT BUT IT WAS PART OF A ACTUAL FOR TRADE MARKET SYSTEM. DO WE POTENTIALLY HAVE EVEN THE WERE. SOURCING THAT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. ONE OFF SO IT IT WON'T BE PROTECTED. HOW CAN WE HAD HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT MISTER CHAIR? IT'S A REAL INTRIGUING SCENARIO BECAUSE IT WAS HERE FOR A SAID PURPOSE SO LIKE MANY OF THE CREATURES THAT ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT PROTECTING SEVEN NUTRIA SO NUTRI ARE NOT PROTECTED LIKE ANIMALS SET FOR BEAR SUCH AS AUTRES THESE ARE CLASSIFIED AS A NON GAME MAMMAL. AND ALSO -- YOU'RE ABLE TO HUNT THEM AS RODENTS BUT ALSO THESE ARE RESTRICTED SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA SO IT IS ILLEGAL TO IMPORT TRANSPORTER POSSESS THEM WITHIN THE STATE BECAUSE OF THEIR DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS. I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE SAME SCENARIO YOU KNOW I'VE CARE TO BUILD FOR WILD PIGS AND IT'S THE SAME EXACT. SITUATION THEY WERE IMPORTED HERE THEY WERE PLANTED HERE FOR GAME FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND IF TURN INTO. A TREMENDOUS NUISANCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN FACT CAUSING THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT YOU OUTLINED IN YOUR REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE. WITH IMPACTS TO THE WILD LANDS INTO THE TO THE LEVEES AND SUCH SO. HOPEFULLY WE CAN -- SOMEDAY WORK BEGAN ON THAT MR CHAIRMAN. MAYBE SEE SOME SUCCESS ON THAT BILL GETTING SIGNED. THANK YOU RAISE SOME GOOD POINTS SHAPE THE WITNESSES RESPONSES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. DR PLEASE YA OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PROBLEM I HAVE NO PROBLEM OPPOSE SUPPORTING IT UP BUT I'M CURIOUS -- HE READ A CANING NOW WHAT I'M METHODOLOGIES IDEA YOU IS IN A SELF POLICING OR TRAPPING ALONG WITH THE DATE WE ARE STRICTLY TRAPPING AND DISPATCHING WE ARE NOT USING POISONS AND HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF USING POISONS. OKAY SO THAT THE METHODOLOGY -- HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IN OTHER STATES ARE LIKE LOUISIANA -- LOUISIANA UNFORTUNATELY HAS HAS GIVEN UP HOPE. ON A RATIFICATION OF THEIR TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE POPULATION BUT IN THE CHESAPEAKE THEY RELY STRICTLY ON ON TRAPPING EFFORTS AND WE HAVE HAD GOOD SUCCESS WITH OUR LIVE TRAPPING EFFORTS WE ARE A GOAL OF THIS EFFORT IS TO ALSO MINIMIZE IMPACT TO NON TARGET SPECIES. SO WE ARE PRIMARILY LIVE TRAPPING SO THAT WE CAN RELEASE IN A NON TARGET CAPTURES THE TRAPPING METHODOLOGY WE WE CAN WE BELIEVE SO. OKAY THANK YOU. YES SIR YEAH I JUST A BRIEF QUESTION ON WHAT WHAT PRAISE ON NUTRIA IF THERE ARE OTHER ANIMALS THAT TO HELP WITH THE THAT THE POPULATION CONTROL. WITHIN THEIR NATIVE EXCUSE ME WITHIN THEIR NATIVE RANGE THEY ARE PREYED UPON BY -- LARGE CAP SUCH AS JAGUARS AN AWFUL IT'S ALSO BY CAME IN AND THEIR HUNTED AS A FOOD SOURCE. IN LOUISIANA THEIR PREYED UPON BY ALLIGATOR SWITCHER NATIVE SPECIES -- VENOMOUS AQUATIC SNAKES AND ALSO HUNTED VIA THE THE BOUNTY PROGRAM WHICH IS -- AN INCENTIVE JUST MAINTENANCE CONTROL MECHANISM WITHIN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY THEY ARE PREYED UPON -- BY. LARGE BIRDS OF PREY SO EAGLES HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED -- AND THEIR POPULATION AND REPRODUCTION IS INHABITED BY THE SEVERE WINTERS WHICH CAUSE MORTALITY IN JUVENILES AND ADULTS. THESE ARE ALL FACTORS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTING TO MORTALITY WITH IN CALIFORNIA -- THE CLOSEST. SIMILAR ANIMALS THAT WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE PROTECTION FROM WOULD BE MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS COYOTES -- WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THOSE WILL PLACE THE A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN PREDATION IN IN TAMPING DOWN THE POPULATION AND WE ALSO DO NOT HAVE THOSE SEVERE WINTERS. THAT PLAY SUCH A ROLE IN THE CHESAPEAKE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK US. TO THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES. IN THE SEVENTIES WE DID HAVE A PROFESSIONAL -- FOR FOR TRAPPING. HAPPY NEW FOR ANIMALS WE NO LONGER HAVE THAT. ARE SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- TO SPEND RESOURCES ON IT IF WE STILL HAD A PROFESSIONAL. OFFER TRAPPING -- INDUSTRY IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT WE DON'T. SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY SOME A DOLLY SECOND BY. THIS IS RUBIO -- MEDITECH TAPES CULTURAL. THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED AT WATER GARCIA. EDUARDO GARCIA I GALLAGHER -- IN IT LIKE. THANK YOU JAMES. GALLAGHER I'D. BIGELOW. BIGELOW I CHOI. CHOI AYE CHU -- CHIU AYE DALLY. DALY AYE FRIEDMAN. CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I GLORIA. GLORIA I KALRA. LEVINE. LEVINE I BLANCA RUBIO. SUMMER MATHIS COME FORWARD SECOND TERM. AND A FINAL ITEM. FOR THE AGENDA WITH. GOOD MORNING WELCOME MORNING [inaudible] PLEASE. MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PROUD TO PRESENT ACA. THREE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY. IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE ESPECIALLY THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WATER IS A HUGE PRIORITY. IN OUR STATE. FOR DECADES WE HAVE SEEN BONTA AFTER BOND BILL AFTER BILL. ALL WITH THE INTENTION OF ADDRESSING OR PERPETUAL WATER CRISIS IN THE SHORT RUN. HOWEVER. WE ARE LEFT WITH THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM SURROUNDING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. A SEVERE AN UNACCEPTABLE LACK OF SECURE AND RECURRING FUNDING. FOR OUR VITAL WATER PROJECTS EACH YEAR. SHE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PILOT. TO A DISASTROUS AND COSTLY EMMA. WE SEE ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS LEFT UNDER FUNDED. OR BANDED POTENTIALLY RESULTING AND PERMANENT DAMAGES TO OUR ECOSYSTEM. WE ALSO SEE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WITH NO WATER WHAT SO EVER. WITHIN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS. IN WHICH THE WATER IS HAZARDOUS. AN UNSAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. WITHIN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THERE'S NO WATER. AT ALL. YOU'VE ALL HEARD ME TALK. ABOUT THE DISASTER ANY SUPPORT OF BILL MANY TIMES BEFORE. SO I'LL BE BRIEF IT'S KNOWN AS THE CITY WITHOUT WATER. EACH DAY. FAMILIES HAD TO DRIVE DOWN TO THE LOCAL CHURCH. TO TAKE SHOWERS. THAT MOBILE UNITS. IF THEY GOT THERE TOO LATE. THE WATER SUPPLY WAS GONE THEY HAD TO FORGO SHOWERING. DOINGDISHES BRUSHING THEIR TEETH FOR THAT ENTIRE DAY PUT SIMPLY. I HAD BETTER CONDITIONS WHY WAS DEPLOYED. IN IRAQ DURING THE WAR. OUR PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM THIRD WORLD WATER CONDITIONS IN OUR STATE. OUR STATE WHICH BOASTS BEING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD. SADLY. I KNOW THAT THIS DISASTER IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY DISTRICT ALONE MISTER CHAIR. YOUR CONTENTION ONCE EXPERIENCE AN ALMOST IDENTICAL SITUATION EACH DAY [inaudible] I APPRECIATE. ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT AND LEADERSHIP IN THIS ISSUE. AND FOR RECOGNIZING THE MERIT IN VALUE THAT A CA THREE BRINGS TO CALIFORNIA [inaudible] MEMBERS. YOUR CONSTITUENTS NEED THIS MEASURE. IN RECENT YEARS. WE'VE SEEN A STAGGERING NUMBER OF WATER BONDS. ON OUR BALLOT. THESE EFFORTS HAVE ADDED BILLION DOLLAR OUTSTANDING GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED BOND DEBT. THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHT BONDS APPROVED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN NOVEMBER. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HOWEVER. VOTERS REJECTED PROPOSITION. THREE AN EIGHT POINT. NINE BILLION DOLLAR WATER BOND. SIGNALING A FUNDAMENTAL DESIRE BY THE VOTERS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM BOX. ACCORDING TO THE PP I SEE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND STATE BONTA HELPS. PHIL FUNDING GAPS. WHAT BONDS ARE NOT A RELIABLE LONG TERM SOURCE? AND THEY GENERALLY DON'T COVER OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. LOOKING BEYOND BONDS TO FILL GAPS SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY. WE CANNOT KEEP MOVING FORWARD. WITH PEACE NO WATER FUNDING. IT IS SIMPLY TOO IMPORTANT. TO NOT LOOK AT WATER FUNDING ON THE LARGE SCALE. WE MUST SHIFT. TOWARDS A MORE APPROPRIATE AND PERMANENT. PAY AS YOU GO FUNDING SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO THE LA ILL. WE FIND THAT BOND FUNDING WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE BECAUSE BONDS PROVIDE A ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCE. AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN ONGOING FUND SOURCE. MOREOVER GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS ARE REPAID FROM THE GENERAL FUND. WITH INTEREST AND THEREFORE WOULD BECAUSE THIS APPROACH TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE GENERAL. FUND. AS SUCH. NOT ONLY WITH THE SHIFT SAVE ON INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. WE CAN EVEN BEGIN TO ADDRESS OUR OUTSTANDING DEBTS. THIS IS WHY ADONAI ALONG WITH MANY COLLEAGUES HAVE AUTHORED A CA. THREE THIS MEASURE WHAT ANNUALLY SET ASIDE 2%. OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE PURPOSES OF FUNDING ANY AND ALL WATER PROJECTS [inaudible] FOREVER THIS MEASURE WOULD ALLOCATE 5%. OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDS TO PAIN DOWN PROP ONE WATER BOND DEBT. THEN ADDRESSING SUBSCRIBE ESSENTIAL SUBSEQUENT WATER BOND DEBTS. WE DECIDED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH. WHEN DISCUSSING WATER FUNDING? PRIORITIES AS EACH PART OF OUR STATE IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT NEEDS. SUCH NEEDS. ARE CONTINUALLY EXACERBATED. BY A PERPETUAL AND WORSENING DROUGHTS. AND VICE VERSA. OUR DISASTROUS FLOODS. THESE DROUGHT HIGHLIGHT THE FACT. THAT OUR WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS ARE ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AND WITH WILL EVENTUALLY FADE AWAY. WITHOUT PRO ACTIVE STEPS. FURTHER WE CAN LOOK AT THE OROVILLE DAM CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE FLOODING THAT ENSUED. AS FURTHER PROOF THAT OUR SYSTEM IS CRUMBLING. AND IS IN DIRE NEED [inaudible] OF REPAIR. WITHOUT THE PROACTIVE APPROACH FOUND AN ACA THREE CALIFORNIA'S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING OUR NATURAL. ENVIRONMENT FULLY CO SYSTEMS WILL ULTIMATELY FAIL THIS FAILURE. WHAT CATASTROPHICALLY JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC HEALTH? THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECONOMIC STABILITY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A PERMANENT FIX. TO OUR CONTINUED SEVERE FINANCIAL SHORTAGES AND WATER FUNDING. SHORTAGES THAT HAVE RESULTED. IN THE DOUBLE PLAY A VITAL WATER PROJECTS [inaudible] AC. THREE WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL. NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE ANNUAL CRISIS [inaudible] MEMBERS. WE MUST UPHOLD THE PROMISE WE MADE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN AFFORDABLE. AND ACCESSIBLE WATER ADEQUATE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION COOKING AND SANITARY PURPOSES. PLEASE JOIN ME AND MY NUMEROUS JOINT AUTHORS. AND CO AUTHORS AND SUPPORTING THIS BIPARTISAN EFFORT. SHOULD ANY OF YOU WISH. TO JOIN ON THIS MEASURE NOW ASK YOU FOR YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS MORNING MR TERM -- EMOTIONS SECOND PLEASE TAKE A MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL GUNS ALL THIS HERE TODAY REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WATER ASSOCIATION. SINGLE VALUE WATER ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS ABOUTSIXTY WATER SUPPLIERS THAT SERVES ABOUT TWO MILLION -- CUSTOMERS AND LA COUNTY. OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE NATION'S LARGEST DRINKING WATER SUPERFUND SITE WE'VE LOCALLY BEEN TRYING TO TAKE MEASURES. THAT LEVERAGE LOCAL DOLLARS FEDERAL FUNDING STATE BOND FUNDING AND REALLY WE SEE THIS AS THE STATE'S DEDICATION TO WATER QUALITY PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE CRITICAL AND NEEDED. THROUGH EVERYONE'S DISTRICTS SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING DAVID WOLF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT OF A CA THREE AND ANOTHER SPENT A MOTION A SECOND SO I'LL BE BRIEF -- 2% OF A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE CURRENT GENERAL FUND BUDGET IS TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR A MILLION CENTRAL VALLEY RESIDENTS CURRENTLY WITHOUT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. AND WHAT A FIX THE OROVILLE DAM AND THEY'RE STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN MONEY LEFT OVER FOR OTHER PROJECTS I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BAIL -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WITH A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SURPLUS AT PRESENT -- I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY THIS THE CURRENT DEBT SERVICE RATIO IN THE GENERAL FUND. OF FOR BONDS IS ABOUT 5% 25% OF THE CURRENT GENERAL FUND GOES TO NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN PAYING OFF FIND AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROP THREE THE WATER BOND LAST NOVEMBER. YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF ONGOING GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES OVER THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS TO PAY OFF THAT DEBT -- AND THAT'S THAT'S A BIG DEBT LOAD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY HE HAD PROP THREE PASSED IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONLY WATER BOND ON ABOUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF OUTSTANDING DEBT -- SIR TO GET A PERMANENT RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE THAT DOESN'T RELY ON DAT YEAR OVER YEAR TO FUND THIS -- WE THINK IT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. DENNIS I'LL BE ON THEIR BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. MARIAN WARMER DOWN RURAL COUNTIES WE SUPPORT. SEVENTY MORAL CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND ASK YOUR SUPPORT. MIKE FLIES ON BEHALF OF FRONT WATER AUTHORITY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUNDING FOR WATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION IMAGINE. OKAY I'LL BRING IT BACK TO DíAS SAID QUESTIONS DOCTOR WHAT. YEAH. FIRST OFF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I DO HAVE SOME I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS -- FIRST OF ALL WHY DID YOU WHERE DID YOU HOW DID YOU ARRIVE ON 2% SO. MR WAS THIS IS SOMETHING NOW ACTUALLY ME IN THE CHAIR BEEN WORKING ON FOR A FEW YEARS -- WHEN WE INITIALLY STARTED LOOKING -- THERE WAS DURING THE SCRAMBLE TO FIGURE OUT -- DIFFERENT NUMBERS -- WE HAD PROP ONE UP A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW PROP ONE WAS A GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO FINISH THEIR PROJECTS. ON TO THE 2% WAS DERIVED AROUND -- THE ABILITY TO FINISH A SINGLE PROJECT WITHIN PROP. ONE ON THE NUMBERS KIND OF AND HONE DOWN AND IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THE WE'VE TALKED WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS ABOUT. ON THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'VE ARRIVED. SO THERE WAS NO ACTUARIAL STUDY THERE WAS NO STUDY TO COME UP WITH THIS THIS 2%. THIS WAS JUST THE BETWEEN YOU AND THE CHAIR AND HAVE AN INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS. ARMED AND DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ALONG THE WAY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS THE LA -- HASN'T WAY DAN OTHERS HAVEN'T WEIGHED AND THIS IS WE WE VAST AND THEY SAID IT'S YOUR MADE A FORMAL REQUEST TO THE LA -- ON THIS [inaudible] NOT. NOT ON THIS AND I'LL. NIGHT AND I GUESS I GUESS FOR ME AND A GUY FOR ME A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- AND I I TO HOLY UNDERSTAND I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF A PRETTY MUCH EVERY WATER. WATER BILL THAT'S COME FORWARD I UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. HOWEVER I LOOK AT MY OWN DISTRICT -- WE ARE WATER DONORS TO THE STATE. YOU NOW TAKE 2% AWAY FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S 2% THAT WE GET WE DON'T GET FOR OTHER THINGS IN ART ALREADY POOR DISTRICT. LIKE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS LIKE HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY ON AN ONGOING BASIS -- AND WE ARE ASKING TO TIE THE HANDS OF FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHICH I ABSOLUTELY A HUGE SUPPORTER OF EDUCATION -- THAT CREATES CHALLENGES FOR US AT TIMES AS WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL REVENUE -- SO -- I ABSOLUTES WHAT WERE YOU DOING BUT FOR THOSE OF US IN AREAS WHERE WHERE WATER IS NOT AN ISSUE WE ARE SURE OUR WATER DONORS -- AND AND AT TIMES WE HAVE WATER CRISIS OF OUR OWN -- YOU'RE TAKING AWAY MONEY FOR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT MY FOLKS -- REALLY STRUGGLE WITH WE CAN'T GET RESOURCES AROUND FROM THE ENVIRO SCAN FOR FROM FROM CARB -- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONSIDERED BECAUSE WE BECAUSE WE HAVE CLEAN WATER. SO WE CAN'T GET SOME OF THE RESOURCES YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IN OTHER PARTS OF YOUR DISTRICT. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I KNOW IT THE WRITING -- WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING A GREAT POINTS MISS WAS I'VE I'VE BEEN UP HERE DISTRICT WITH YOU WE'VE WE'VE GONE ON SEVERAL TURNS UP THERE AND? NOT SEEING THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE WITH FISH TRIBUTARIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE FUNDING FROM THIS WOULD ACTUALLY HELP COVER THE COST OF THOSE AND ENSURE THAT -- YOUR WATER NEEDS IN YOUR AREA -- STAY -- AS PRISTINE AS THEY ARE AND WHAT INSURE THOSE ECOLOGICAL SO WHO WOULD DETERMINE THAT. WHO WHO WHAT SO SO THE WAY THAT ANY BREAKS OUT OR IS BETWEEN THE STATE WATER BOARD ENDED UP YOU ARE? UNDER WHAT CRITERIA BASICALLY FOLLOWING THE OUTLINE OF PROP. ONE UNDER THE UNDER THE CURRENT WATER BONG. YEAH I GUESS -- YOU KNOW. SITTING HERE NEXT TO ON MISTER DALI ANIMATRONIC DRAG HIM INTO THIS CONVERSATION ANYWAY. BUT YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE YOU KNOW WE WERE FACING A WHILE FOR CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE STRUGGLE TO GET YOU KNOW WE WANTED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- TO HELP SUPPRESS WILDFIRES AND AND WE STRUGGLE WE GOT TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S SINCE PUT IN ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH I'M. REALLY THANKFUL -- FOR BUT YOU KNOW THAT AFFECTS OUR WATER OUR WATERSHEDS AND WITH THAT THAT FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS ARE FIRE PROTECTION EFFORTS IN IN MY DISTRICT [inaudible] CELL. YOU KNOW I I ACTUALLY RAN A BILL TO TAKE -- G. G. R. F. FUNDS AWAY FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH DOESN'T HELP YOUR DISTRICT EITHER AND HAVE A GO TO CAL FIRE TO HELP OUT WITH THE FIRES -- WE HAVE SEVERAL FIRES AND MY DISTRICT AS WELL. AND I THINK THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BEING DONE IN THAT AREA -- HOWEVER THERE'S NOT BEEN IN. ENOUGH DONE AND WATER AGREED AND VERSE IS BOND AFTER BON AFTER BOND. I THINK IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE MADE A PROMISE TO OUR CITIZENS THAT WE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO WATER. IN A INDUSTRY INDUSTRY SETS US UP IN IN AN AVENUE WHERE. EVERY DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE WATER NEEDS ARE WHETHER IT BE ENVIRONMENTAL. WHETHER IT BE A BAD FIVE SLACK WHAT LA IS DEALING WITH. THIS PROVIDES ONGOING REVENUE. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WATER NEEDS. SO AND I UNDERSTAND IT IN IN THE NORTH DISTRICT YOU MIGHT FEEL THE DAUGHTERS BUT YOU DO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE UP THERE. THE NEEDS TO TO ENSURE THAT THE MAINTENANCE IS GOING ON AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER ORVILLE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE GO TO THAT POINT. SO IT HATE TO SEE ANY LEVEES OR CANALS -- ANYTHING UP IN YOUR AREA AND NOT GET THE MAIN IS THAT IT NEEDS -- AND SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS. GREAT I JUST -- I I GUESS MY MY TWO PRIMARY ISSUES IS -- WHERE THE NUMBER COME FROM? AND WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL NEEDS. AND I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE FUTURE TIE THE HANDS OF FUTURE LEGISLATURES TO SOMETHING THAT IS POTENTIALLY THREE THREE BILLION POTENTIALLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. ANDIS THE BUDGET CONTINUES TO GROW THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO GO UP. AND I JUST I HAVE CONCERNS I JUST TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I I'M I'M PROUD TO LAY OFF TODAY [inaudible] OUR WE HAVE -- CANTON. TO THEN MR DOLLY THEN. THIS IS ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- A TO THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR. AM A MEMBER STAFF REALLY THE SIGN ON FULL OF FULL FOCUS -- A BALE. OF MARK YOU KNOW IT. GONE DOWN TO THE WATER BOARD IS WHICH IS USED. TURTLE IS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT THAT YOU'VE YOU BROUGHT TO WHO -- TO YOU. TO US TODAY. AND I HAVE A IN MY YEARS HOUSES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HELPED A BIT EVERY YEAR I HAVE BILLS TRYING TO SOLVE THE GOOD DEAL THE WATER YOU SHOULD. MAKE SURE THAT WE EVERYBODY HAS A FAIR SHARE AND AN UNTITLED WHO WILL CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO I AGREE. WITH EVERYTHING YOU DO HAVE TO AT BUT LIKE DOCTOR DOCTOR WOULD I DO HAVE. A YUSHU [inaudible] WITH THE YOU KNOW DOING ARE THE BUDGET BY A BALLOT BOX. WE WE HAVE THE VERY -- YOUR I DON'T KNOWS IS A PERFECT BUT WE DO HAVE A PROCESS OF DID IT DID THE ON DOING OUR BUDGET ON ANNUAL BASIS -- PRECISE TYPING AND TYING UP THEIR HANDS OVER FUTURE -- LEGISLATURE. I AM CONCERNING THAT -- THIS IS THE SLOPE OF THE SLIPPERY SLOPE. ALRIGHT I HAVE THE SAME PASSION WAS TO WATER AS WELL AS FOR EDUCATION. AS WELL AS A PUBLIC SAFETY. LEGAL CLIMATE CHANGE IN AND AS WELL AS A TRANSPORTATION ISSUE. IF WE ALL OWE YOU KNOW ARE ALL THOSE IMPORTING ISSUE WOULD PUT A FIXED NUMBER WEATHER. IS A GOAL OF BY THE L. A. YOU ARE YOUR CONSTITUENT A STAKEHOLDER. THEN YOU REALLY REALLY. DEFEAT THE PROFITS OF OF WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. TO TO TO DETERMINE ON THE BUDGET ON THE ANNUAL BASIS YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THAT OUR REVENUE MADE OF FLUCTUATE. AND WE WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE DECISION. LISTING INFORMATION AND OVERSIGHT OVER TO FUND SHOW ARE OF ALLOCATED. SO OUR WORK -- I RESPECTFULLY -- AND STAY OFF ON ON THE ON YOUR BILL TODAY. SADDAM. THEY MEASURE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SO -- I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S LOTS OF ISSUES IN THE STATE TO TO NEED RESOURCES WITH WATER -- BUT I'M ALSO. SOMEONE WHO IS FOR MANY MANY YEARS DONE BUDGETS THAT ARE ALREADY COMPLETELY ALLOCATED OUT AND THERE'S THE GENERAL FUND IS. FOR GENERAL PURPOSE THANKS. WHEN THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND BECAUSE YOU'VE ALLOCATED IT THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO A BUDGET? SO -- BUT I'M ALSO WANT TO SHARE WITH THE THE AUTHOR THAT TOM. YOU PICK THE NUMBER 2% WHICH I THINK IN EUROPE IN THE ANALYSIS I HAVE HERE WOULD BE LIKE TWO POINT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR. AND I HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO IN MYSELF ACTUALLY -- WHO HAS NOW BEEN REGULATED BY THE I. R. M. W. PEAS WHICH IS THAT YOUR RELATED LANDS WHICH WE PAY WE ARE TAXED? A RECESSED A FEE SAME THING IS MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKET TO DO WATERSHED -- ANALYSIS BASICALLY FOR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- AND WE DO THIS. IN ALL THE REGIONS OF THE STATE SO THAT'S A TAX ON MY MY LAND COULD BECAUSE I'M FARMING NOW WE HAVE THE GROUND WATER. THE SIGMA THE STATE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANTS IF YOU'RE IN A RAFT DOES THIS MONEY -- GONNA OFFSET. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAPPEN TO PAY THOSE. FEES AND TAXES NOW -- TO SUPPLY BASICALLY BACKED BILL FOR THE STATE WATER FOR THE THE THE STATE. WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THEMSELVES WE HAVE TO PAY AND AND WE'RE WE'RE REGULATE OURSELVES. AND ON I WANTED ALSO TO ASK ABOUT. YOUR NORMAL CRISIS WAS. DUE TO A LACK OF MAINTENANCE WE KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM THERE AND THE AND THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE WATER ON THE OTHER END SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- IN THE BUREAU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING THEIR JOB AND AND FIXING THEM THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED EARLIER IN THE IN -- THE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BUT THEY BUT THEY DO A DAY DATE NEGLECTED TO DO THAT. AND THE COST OF BEARING THAT SHOULD BE ON THEM. BECAUSE THEY DID MATE IT'S THERE. IF A STRUCTURE THAT WAS THERE BEFORE SO -- I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT THERE'S A LOT LACK OF A LOT OF DETAILS -- THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO ARE YOU GONNA SAY THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN GROUNDWATER BASINS SUCH AS YOURSELF THAT ARE IMPAIRED. ARE THEY GONNA HAVE TO BEAR THAT COST -- THIS CALL IS THIS GOING TO PAY FOR THAT AND WHAT WHAT IS IT REALLY GONNA PAY FOR THERE'S A LOT OF PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT -- FOLKS ARE BEING TAXED ON AND FEED -- ARE THOSE GOING TO GO AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE DEDICATING A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY -- EVERY YEAR -- TO YOU KNOW CONTINUOUSLY BE APPROPRIATED OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. SOME MEMORY. WHAT CAN I GET AN ANSWER? ARE YOU OR ARE YOU GOING. TO ADMIT MR DOLL I GUESS I'LL LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU. NUMBER. ONE OR THE OTHER IS THIS MONEY GOING TO BE DIRECTED IN EAR MARKED IN THE DIRECTION THAT GOES TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE IN IMPAIRED GROUNDWATER. RECHARGE SITUATION ARE ARE YOU CAN OFFSET THAT COST ARE YOU GONNA CONTINUE TO TAX THEM TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AND AND THEN TAKE THIS MONEY AND GO I HAVE WELL INTENTIONED AND TO TAX ANYBODY AND AND FORCE THEM TO PAY MORE. THE THE POINT OF TAKING OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND IS THIS IS TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE. THIS IS MONEY THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE ALREADY PAYING -- IN REGARDS TO SIGNAL -- THERE SEVERAL PROJECTS COMING UP -- WE'RE GROUND WATER RECHARGE IS GONNA BE VITAL WE HAVE -- MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- DUE TO THE LACK OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. AND THE RESULTS ON DEALING WITH -- THE SINKING OF LANDS. ON AROUND THAT. WE HAVE TO HAVE FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT IN PLACE TO MEET SIGMAR REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S ALL PART OF IT THAT'S WHY THIS IS DESIGNED TO COVER ANY AND ALL WATER PROJECTS. SO WHETHER WE'RE DEALING WITH SICK MORE PROJECTS WERE DEALING WITH REDOING CITY INFRASTRUCTURE WERE DEALING WITH -- MAINTENANCE ON EXISTING -- CANALES DAMS LEVEES EXCEPT RAW THIS IS FUNDING TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO COVER THOSE COSTS. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING UP WITH NEW WAYS. ON FOR OUR WATER DISTRICTS YOUR CHARTER PEOPLE TO DO THIS ON US FOR WE HAVE SEVERAL WATER DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT. WE HAVE A ONE WAY TO PULL FUNDING FROM. AND AGAIN A. AS THE L. AO. STATED. BY INTO REITERATE THEIR QUOTE -- YOU KNOW THEY SAY MOREOVER -- GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS -- A REPAID FROM THE GENERAL FUND WITH INTEREST THEREFORE. WOULD CAUSE THIS APPROACH TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. SO EVEN AT THE LA ALL THINGS DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS. THUS MARKING 2%. WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GO THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST DECADE WHICH IS BOND AFTER BOND AFTER BOUGHT HI WHAT WHAT'S IN AGREE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO ELECTION IS IS. MIKE I I TOTALLY GET THAT I KNOW YOU'RE PAYING THE LOTTO FOR THIS YES [inaudible] OKAY. IT'S OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND AND I'D LOVE THE DIVE INTO ANY DETAILS TO WORK WITH YOU MOAN [inaudible] FOR MR LIVING. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- YES THIS IS THE WATER IS A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPLICATED ISSUE -- AND WE THIS IS A YEAR FOLLOWING A LOT OF YEARS WE'VE DUG OURSELVES OUT OF A HOLE WHERE WE DO HAVE AN AMAZING SURPLUS AND I I WOULD BE COMPLETELY FINE IF WE TOOK OUR CLEAN WATER CHALLENGES AND DEALT WITH IT THIS YEAR. AND I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD COME UP WITH A PLAN. TO TAKE THIS STAIN -- FROM OUR STATE AND WIPE IT CLEAN AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS CLEAN DRINKING WATER THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT THIS YEAR -- I DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR ACA -- THOUGH I I I UNDERSTAND IT COMES FROM A VERY GOOD PLACE. YOU'RE QUITE FRANKLY. THE THE DEDICATION OF A PERCENT OF THIS BUDGET IS NOT JUST LIMITING WHAT WE DO WITH THE GENERAL FUND. IT IS DIRECTING US TO CUT CHILD CARE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE STATE PARKS SOCIAL SERVICES THE LIST GOES ON AS SOON AS THE BUDGET GOES DOWN AND TAKES A DEBT -- IN THE NEXT RECESSION. IT IS GOING TO OCCUR SO YOU WOULD BE NOT JUST FINDING OUR HANDS ACTUALLY FORCING US. TO WHACK THINGS THAT WE CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT WHEN WE COULD JUST HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL NOW TO USE THE MONEY TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TODAY. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A PLAN SO WE HAVE A 2% 2% SOUNDS GREAT. YOU CAN ARGUE WITH 2% A SOUNDS LIKE BUDGET DUST THE WAY THAT WE TALK. ON WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON HOW MANY YEARS WILL IT TAKE US TO DO IT FOREVER IS THAT EVEN THE RIGHT AMOUNT WE DON'T KNOW. BUT IF WE TOOK UP A PROP TO APPROACH A RAINY DAY FUND APPROACH WITHOUT ACTUALLY PASSING A PROPOSITION BUT SANE. WHEN THE BUDGET IS IN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE IT IS TODAY? AND WE USE A PORTION OF THAT TO WORK DOWN THAT PLAN. THAT WOULD GET US ON A PATHWAY TO SOLVING A LOT OF OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS. OF COURSE THE CHALLENGES WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF UNMET PLANS THAT WE NEED TO DO FOR CALIFORNIA -- SO OUR OUR TO DO LIST IS PRETTY HIGH SO APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT BY WHICH YOU BROUGHT THIS. JUST THERE'S NO PLAN. IT BINDS OUR HANDS IN A WAY THAT IN FACT FORCES US TO CUT. SO MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON EVERY DAY -- SO LET'S CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS THANKS VERY MUCH THE MISSILES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS ABOUT THIS APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THIS MEASURE BEFORE US I MEAN -- THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS YOU KNOW THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S GROW TO OVER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T? UP WITH THE MONEY. WITH THAT GROWTH. SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A AS A CUT TO OTHER SERVICES I SEE IT AS YOU KNOW SAME THING WE DO WITH PROPOSITION. AT NINETY EIGHT FOR EDUCATION WE SET ASIDE. MONEY BECAUSE WE SAY THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. WATER IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY COMMUNITY TO GROW. IT'S ESSENTIAL. FOR LIFE -- I SEE THAT AS A THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN RESOLVE IN THE LANGUAGE AND THE LEGISLATION I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING -- THAT HAS SOME MERIT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT I SEE THIS COMPLETELY AS AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE ONE OF THE THE MAIN CHARGES. FOR US I BELIEVE AS LEGISLATORS JUST TO MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS. AND AND TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT WORKS WE NEED TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR GOVERNMENT TO WORK AND I SEE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW BE VOTING I TODAY. THANK YOU. OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADD MONEY -- SUPPORT. AS WE HERE OUR WATER IS SO IS CENSURED FOR OUR LIFE SUSTAINING. AND THE AGRICULTURE AND WAS STATUS -- HEAVILY -- DEPEND ON THE PHONE OKAY WE CULTURE SO THIS IS SO -- MANAGEMENT AND BUILDING NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ON OUR STATE -- HAS A WATER PROBLEM -- AND THIS IS -- IS ESSENTIAL. OUR RESOURCES SELF FOR THE RIGHT THE MANAGEMENT. AND THE WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES SO CAN WE OF PUT AWFUL WATER WATER AIR AND SUN LIGHT. TO MAINTAIN -- OUR HUMAN LIFE SO AND ON AGRICULTURE. THE MEDIA ARE DEPEND ON NOW IN THE WHOLE CALIFORNIA ALWAYS ECONOMY SO I THINK THIS IS SO. PROVIDING NECESSARY RESOURCES SO -- THAT THE PHOTO LONG TERM MORE A DEFINITIVE PLAN AND THE TELLING -- PEOPLE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS A SERIOUS ABOUT THE BY SETTING ASIDE THAT THIS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY I THINK THIS IS. NOT WEISS MANAGEMENT THE RATHER THAN -- ISSUING AS YOU STATED THE BONDS SO THAT THE LOCALLY AND THAT THAT IS A ADDITIONAL TAX. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A HUMONGOUS SURPLUSES. IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THAT WOULD NOT THE HURT OR THE PROGRAM SO -- AND IS NOT AN EXCHANGE THIS IS STUFF BETTER WISE UTILIZATION OF OUR EXISTING NOW READ A BUDGETARY RESOURCES. ARE THERE FOR I STRONGLY SUPPORT. HI THIS MESSAGE THANK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OKAY -- SEEN NONE. I THINK WE'VE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION HERE. IRRESPECTIVE OF UP THE POSITION -- THAT -- MEMBERS HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE -- PRESENTED THE THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY SEE WITH THE CURRENT -- LANGUAGE WITHOUT HAVING YOU PRESENT THIS -- MEASURE. WE DON'T GET THIS FEEDBACK. HI -- IT SITS IN RULES AND ULTIMATELY THE IDEAS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS WHAT I THINK EVERYONE HERE HAS SAID AND AGREED WE HAVE A WATER PROBLEM. INCALIFORNIA WHETHER IT BE AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM. OR FOR THAT MATTER A DIRECT A PUBLIC HEALTH -- PROBLEM PERTAINING TO PEOPLE NOT HAVING CLEAN WATER. RIGHT. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU STEPPING INTO THE SPACE. AND WANTING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IT MAY NOT BE THE ACA MAY NOT BE SOME BILL TWO ONE SEVEN AND MAY NOT BE THE SENATE BILL THAT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS -- THE CLEAN DRINKING WATER BUT I THINK THE COMMON IS. LET'S TRY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM THIS YEAR -- WE HAVE SOME MONEY IN THE BUDGET. NOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT. OUT PUT FORWARD TO SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCES. I SEE THIS AS JUST ANOTHER OPTION ON THE TABLE FOR US -- TO DISCUSSED DELIBERATE DEBATE -- MISTER WOULD YOU BRING UP SOME VERY GOOD POINTS AS IT RELATES TO WHY 2%. RIGHT MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE WORK ON FIGURING OUT WHAT THE NUMBER IS I WOULD HOPE THAT THE NUMBER DOESN'T COME BACK. NEEDING TO BE 5%. RIGHT THAT IT DOES. I THINK THE POINT HERE OF DEDICATING PERCENTAGES THAT WE HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE. AND THAT MAY NOT BE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM BUT THAT IS A PROPOSAL RIGHT THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS. OF HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT IS. THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS -- PRIORITIZING REGIONS PROJECTS AND AGAIN THE ONE MILLION PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER I WOULD IMAGINE WOULD BE. AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST. SO WE DON'T BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION -- AND WE STAY ON THE SAME. KINDA PAGER THE SAME PLACE -- ONE MORE YEAR -- WITHOUT HAVING SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF FOR THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER SO I WANT TO COMMEND YOU I PUT MY NAME ON THE RESOLUTION BECAUSE I THINK -- PUTTING FORWARD AN IDEA -- IS IMPORTANT. AND YOU TAKE THE RISK. RIGHT OF THE TYPES OFCOMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THAT THAT WE HAVE HEARD TODAY. WHETHER THEY BE CONCERNS. OR THOSE WHO HAVE SAID HEY WE SUPPORT -- THE CONCEPT MOVING FORWARD AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT IS A CONSTANT MOVING FORWARD -- WHETHER OR NOT THIS -- MAKES IT TO THE FINISH LINE -- I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU AND WE COLLECTIVELY STAY ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO SOLVE% CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS YEAR SO. ALL UP CLOSE WITH THAT DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A SUPPORT YOUR BILL BUT I HAVE A LOT TO RESERVATIONS AND AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO NOT VOTE FOR IT WHEN HE GETS THE FLOOR IF IT'S NOT HAS A LOT MORE DETAIL NEED A LOT MORE DETAIL. HI PLEASE CLOSE FIRA. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THE DIALOGUE AND HEARING THE CONCERNS -- IN REGARDS TO THE 1% I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO TAKE AMENDMENTS. I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO WORK WITH. ANY AND ALL SIDES OF AN ARGUMENT. TO SEEK THE BEST. RESOLVE FOR OUR PEOPLE. YOU KNOW AS WE ALL KNOW WATER IN THE STATE IT IS A VERY HOLISTIC THANK. BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH WATER FROM THE HEADWATERS WE COUNT OUR SNOW PACK WE COUNT OUR RAINFALL. WE HAVE THAT WATER COME DOWN. WE CAPTURE IT. WE CONVEY IT WE MOVE IT WE HAVE VERY INTEGRATED SYSTEMS. IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE CLEAN UP PROJECTS WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS WE HAVE WHAT WINS PROJECTS. WE HAVE FOLKS ON THE COAST TO DEAL WITH SALT WATER INTRUSION ISSUES WE HAVE FOLKS IN LA THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE PIPING PROBLEMS THERE [inaudible] WE HAVE. DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU'RE AT AND LOOKING AT THIS. THIS WAS A WAY TO SAY. OKAY GREAT WE HAVE THIS GREAT BUDGET THIS YEAR. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT YEAR. WHAT ABOUT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW? WHAT ABOUT TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT ABOUT FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW? HOW ARE WE GONNA SET UP? THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE SITTING IN OUR SEATS DECADES FROM NOW. WHEN THE POPULATIONS OR LARGER. WHAT OPTIONS WHATEVER STRUCTURE? ARE WE GOING TO HAVE IN PLACE WHAT KIND OF FUNDING SYSTEM ARE WE GONNA HAVE. FOR THEM. ARE WE GONNA HAVE. HAVE PUT TOGETHER. THE WATER PROJECTS THE MAINTENANCE. THE ONGOING FUNDING THAT IS NEEDED TO SERVICE. THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE WE GOING. TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH SUCH A PLAN. AND I BELIEVE. ACA THREE IS THE WAY TO DO THAT. WHETHER IT'S 2% WHETHER IT'S 1% WHETHER IT'S FIVE OR 10%. I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT THE PERCENTAGE IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT MEMBERS AND WHAT WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT. IS THE FACT THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. WE KNOW BONDS ARE NOT THE WAY TO CONTINUE FORWARD. IN A DIRECT ALLOCATION. TO ME SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST VIABLE. PROCESSES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. AND IT GUARANTEES IT. FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL HERE. I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL.

THE FUTURE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT -- TWO PANELS WILL ASK -- THE FIRST PRESENTER RACHEL WITH THE ALLEY OWES OFFICE. TO COME FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AGAIN. WHAT A WELCOME MAYA? CHAIRMAN CORK DOCTOR WORK. FOR JOINING US ALSO -- IN TODAY'S HEARING. PLEASE DROP AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE READY GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. PASSING OUT A HAND OUT. WHICH I WILL USE FOR MY PRESENTATION I'VE BEEN ASKED TO I THINK GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT BOTH FOR THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST HAD AS WELL AS THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE -- REGARDING FUNDING FOR WATER RELATED ACTIVITIESSO -- I'LL START WITH KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF EXISTING FUNDING WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON BONDS SINCE THAT'S BEEN A BIG -- SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING FOR WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES AND THEN JUST TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME IDEAS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR OTHER OPTIONS FOR FUNDING WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES. AT IN OUR HAND IT IS ON OUR WEBSITE M.. L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOV FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE IN THE ROOM. SO TURNING TO PAGE. ONE OUR COLLEAGUE THAT PP I SEE WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM NEXT HAVE DONE SOME WORK LOOKING AT EXISTING FUNDING AND SPENDING ON WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES AND ESTIMATE THAT IT'S ABOUT THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE BULK OF THIS IS THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT 85% HALF FROM LOCAL SOURCES SO WE TALK A LOT HERE ABOUT STATE FUNDING FOR WATER -- BUT REALLY THAT THAT IS THE SMALLER SHARE ABOUT 12%. OF PP I SEE ESTIMATES SO CERTAINLY IMPORTANT -- AND CERTAINLY THE BIGGEST PIECE THAT'S IN YOUR PER PER VIEW AS THE LEGISLATURE BUT ABOUT A REALLY SMALL RELATIVELY PIECE OF THE OVERALL -- PIE. AND MOST OF THAT STATE FUNDING IS RELATED TO BONDS EITHER IN BOND FUNDING THAT GOES OUT EACH YEAR OR IN GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEBT SERVICE ON THIS MONTH'S THERE IS SOME GENERAL FUND FOR WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES TO BUT MUCH MORE MINOR COMPARED TO THE BONDS AND THE DEBT. SERVICE. SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO JUST LOOKING AT WHAT THE RECENT BONDS ARE AM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THESE ARE THE WATER. AND NATURAL RESOURCES RELATED BONDS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES TOTALING THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS -- FOR VINCE THERE ARE PIECES OF THIS THAT AREN'T WATER YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME PARKS MANY IN HERE AND HABITAT MANY IN HERE AS WELL BUT BUT MOSTLY WATER RELATED. OUT MOST OF THE SPENDING AT IS EITHER COMMITTED TO PROJECTS OR ALREADY SPENT ON PROJECTS. THE EXCEPTIONS DOWN SOME OF THE MORE RECENT ONES. AS WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH -- IN IN YOUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION BONDS ARE NOT CHEAP MANY -- THEY ARE THEY DO AT CARRIE INTERESTS SO WE ESTIMATE THAT FOR ABOUT EACH DOLLAR THAT IS BORROWED IT COSTS ABOUT A DOLLAR AND THIRTY CENTS WENT TO TAKE INTO. ACCOUNT INFLATION PAID OVERTIME -- FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT JOB ON DEBT AND WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING RIGHT NOW ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IT FROM OUR GENERAL FUND. FOR BOND DEBT AT JET SERVICE RELATED TO NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE VOTERS. SO TURNING TO PAGE THREE FOCUSING A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THOSE WATER COMPONENTS OF THOSE RESET OF THE TWO MOST RECENT BONDS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES. ARE THAT PROPOSITION ONE IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDED ARE RELATED TO WATER. THAT SECOND CATEGORY THE WATER SYDNEY BECAUSE SYSTEM PROTECTION RESTORATION. THERE MAY BE SOME IS THAT SOME WOULD QUIBBLE WITH SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS BEING WATER RELATED BUT THERE'S A CLOSE NEXUS THINGS LIKE AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT BROUGHT UP -- WATERSHED HEALTH AND WATERSHED -- FOREST MANAGEMENT THAT THAT CAN BE RELATED TO WATER BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE MOST OF OUR WATER ORIGINATES -- SO OF THESE FUNDS FOR PROPOSITION ONE MOST OF IT HAS BEEN THE VAST MAJORITY HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND MOST OF IT IS COMMITTED TO PROJECTS ALREADY KIND OF SPOKEN. FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT OBVIOUSLY JUST PASSED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO SO THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE OF THAT MANY KIND OF AVAILABLE. BUT IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IT WILL BE ABOUT HALF OF PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT WILL BE APPROPRIATED ALREADY EVEN WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR -- OUT FOR PROJECTS. AND THEN JUST A NOTE I THINK THIS WAS ALSO DISCUSSED A BIT EARLIER BUT BOND FUNDS ARE USUALLY USED FOR LARGE PROJECTS THAT -- ARE PAID FOR OVERTIME NOT USUALLY USED FOR ONGOING ACTIVITIES LIKE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ON THEIR SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT ONE IS THAT IT'S ONE TIME MANY SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO COMMIT FOR AN ONGOING PURPOSE -- AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS FUTURE TAXPAYERS WHO ARE PAYING FOR IT BIG WITH THE INTEREST OVER TIME IT MAKES SENSE FOR IT TO BE. SPENT ON LARGE PROJECTS THAT THOSE FUTURE TAXPAYERS WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM. SO TURNING TO PAGE FOUR ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ALL OF THIS EXISTING FUNDING AS HAS BEEN A BIG THEME OF YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY -- THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF NEEDS -- DESPITE THESE FUNDS M.. THEY RESULT FROM AGING INFRASTRUCTURE GROWING POPULATION. INCREASE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS -- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS ON THE ON THE FUNDING AND AND ABILITY TO RAISE EXISTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- THAT IS BOTH RELATED TO CAPACITY IN CERTAIN AREAS SOME COMMUNITIES THAT CAN'T RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS REQUIREMENTS AROUND HOW YOU CAN RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN PROPOSITION TWO TWENTY SIX PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN SOME OF THESE -- CONSTRAINTS THAT VOTERS HAVE CHOSEN TO PLACE AROUND THE ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL REVENUES -- SO WE HAVE BEEN ASKED MANY TIMES AND YOU HAVE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES SOME OF THESE OTHER OPTIONS AS JUST. WAS ALLUDED TO BY THE CHAIR SO HERE ON PAGE FOUR WE HAVE SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE REGULARLY TALKED ABOUT BY THE LEGISLATURE -- THERE ARE STATE LEVEL FUNDING SOURCES USUALLY. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RAISING THE REVENUES IT'S EITHER FEES WHICH ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE USED? OR TAXES -- WHICH AS OFTEN MORE RELATED TO HOW THE FUNDING IS GENERATED -- SO THEIR REGULATORY FEES OR CHARGES. RELATED TO WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE -- WILL BE TAXES RELATED TO THE BENEFICIARIES ARE -- AND BRENDA BROAD TAXES AND THEN ALSO AS WAS JUST DISCUSSED LOOKING AT EXISTING FUNDING AND HOW YOU WANT TO DEDICATE SOME OF YOUR EXISTING FUNDING. NAMELY THE GENERAL FUNDS THAT COULD EITHER BE THROUGH EXIT AT INCREASING EXISTING SPENDING LEVELS DEDICATING PERCENTAGES AS YOU JUST DISCUSSED OR IF YOU CHOOSE TO AN ACNE BONDS THAT ULTIMATELY HAS A GENERAL FUND EFFECT AND IS. REALLY THE RESULT. pADDITIONAL SPENDING FROM GENERAL FUND. THEY'RE ALSO ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE TO AUTHORIZE LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WOULDN'T BE KIND OF AUTOMATIC THESE TWO AT THE BOTTOM. BUT WOULD PROVIDE MORE THIRTY FOR LOCALS THESE HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT TRYING -- TO ADOPT SOME CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT WOULD ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR RAISING REVENUES. SO TURNING TO PAGE. FIVE JUST SOME BROAD CONSIDERATIONS AS YOU MAY BE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE OPTIONS -- AND WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ARE THE **** MOST APPROPRIATE THESE ARE SOME OF THE CATEGORIES THAT WE WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU THINK ABOUT -- AND THE FIRST IS WHAT WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE WHAT ACTIVITIES DO YOU WANT TO UNDERTAKE AND THAT CAN HELP GUIDE SOME OF THE REVENUE OPTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. WHO ARE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHAT WOULD YOU BE UNDERTAKING WITH THE FUNDING? REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE BENEFICIARIES AND RESPONSIBLE PARTY SO YOU CAN DRAW THAT NEXUS BETWEEN THE FUNDING WHO'S BENEFITING FROM IT IF IT'S A BROAD ACTIVITY THAT STATE WIDE YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT A MORE BROAD -- SOURCE OF FUNDING COMPARED TO IF THERE'S A BENEFIT REALLY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ARE FOR ONE PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF OF ENTITY -- AND THEN THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD BE USED AS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION TO PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- FUNDING AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL WITH PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX IF IT'S A FEE THE USE OF THE FUNDING HAS TO BE REALLY RELATED -- TO THOSE WHO ARE PAYING THE FEE. I HOW MUCH REVENUE DO YOU NEED IF IT'S A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR PROBLEM THEN PURSUING A REVENUE OPTION THAT RAISES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PROBABLY ISN'T WORTH IT. AND WON'T GET YOU THERE AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE VOLATILITY OR STABILITY OF THAT REVENUE AS WELL IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FINDING SOMETHING LIKE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WERE STAFF WILL BE HIRED AND THE NEEDS OF THE SAME EVERY YEAR. BUT YOU PURSUER HAVE REVENUE SOURCE THAT MAY BE REALLY VOLATILE EACH YEAR THEN YOU MAY RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO LINKING UP AGAIN THAT NEXUS OF WHAT IS THAT FUNDING COMING FROM AND HOW EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO USE IT WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE. RIGHT SIZING THE SOLUTION WITH THE PROBLEM. AND THEN FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE SIX THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE NITTY GRITTY. ENACTMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS OF SOME OF THESE OPTIONS. WHAT WITH THE VOTE REQUIREMENTS BE WHAT KIND OF DATA IS NECESSARY -- IN ORDER TO ENACT SOMETHING AS SOME SOME OF THESE OPTIONS AND IS THAT AVAILABLE HOW COMPLICATED WOULD IT BE -- TO IMPLEMENTED IF IT TAKES A LOT OF ADMINISTRATION AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN A LOT OF FUNDING IT'S ONLY RAISING A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS IS THAT WORTH IT. SO THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS. HOW MUCH LATITUDE WILL WOULD THERE BE OVER HOW THE FUNDING IS USED VERSUS HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO PRESCRIBE HOW THE FUNDING IS USED AND THEN WHAT OVERSIGHT WOULD THERE BE FOR YOU AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY BUT ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW HOW FUNDS ARE USED AND? AND HOW THEY'RE BEING IMPLEMENTED. SAY I THINK THE BIG TAKE AWAY IS THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE NOW FOR WATER RELATED ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO. QUITE A BIT IN NEEDS THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR YOU AS A LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE OPTIONS YOU WANT TO PURSUE AND HOW WELL IT ALIGNS WITH THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. SO AGAIN JUST SOME CONTEXT BOTH FOR THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST HAD BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT SOME NEEDS IN YOUR IN YOUR NEXT PRESENTATION SO STARTING TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT WANT. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE NEEDS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE ALWAYS HAPPY TO BE HERE AS A RESOURCE FOR YOU. ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. KHAN COMES YES SIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND MUCH OF IT HAS. TO DO WITH THE FUNDING IN THE TORAH BONDS -- CURRENTLY. A USUAL US A COMPREHENSIVE -- PICTURE OF THAT THE YOU FOR HERE LISTENING TO A SEE A NUMBER -- THREE WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF A 2% OF OUR GENERAL FUND SET ASIDE THE PHOTO OF WHAT -- ACTIVITIES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE. DO YOU. HAVE A IN THE ON OUR LOSSES SO. WHEN THE BECAUSE SAID THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF? WHETHER THAT THE 2% IS A RIDE TOMORROW. TOO MUCH WHAT TOO LITTLE -- DO YOU HAVE ANY OPINION ON THAT. OUR OFFICE DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION ON BILLS -- AND WE HAVEN'T LOOKED CAREFULLY AT AC THREE IN THE NEEDS I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES M. M. PPC MAY BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AT LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CATEGORIES OF FUNDING THAT IT KIND OF OUR FUNDING. ORPHANS IS HOW THEY HAVE TURNED THEM THAT THAT DON'T HAVE A A STREAM OF FINDING. THINGS LIKE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SARSI CAN WATER -- FLOOD MANAGEMENT IS ANOTHER ECOSYSTEM SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CATEGORIES OF ACTIVITIES AND SOME ESTIMATES OUT THERE FOR SOME OF THOSE CATEGORIES BUT BUT OUR OFFICE HASN'T TAKEN A CAREFUL LOOK AT AC THREE OR QUANTIFIED THE NEED. LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSIONS SO WHILE AGO DO YOU PLAN TO HAVE A SOME ANALYSIS ON THAT -- 2% SUGGESTION -- WE DON'T TYPICALLY DO ANALYSES OF OF EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT COMES THAT'S USUALLY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THAT COMES WERE HAPPY TO BE A RESOURCE TO THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS -- TO WORK WITH YOU. THAT'S SO VERY DIFFICULT -- POSITION FOR YOU TO TAKE -- I'M NOT ASKING FOR IT TO TAKE ANY POSITION BUT THE ANALYSIS OF WHETHER THAT AMOUNT THAT WOULD SOLVE ALL WALK ON WATER RELATED ISSUES. SO THAT THE NOVEL QUESTIONS SO THAT THE RAISED UP BY THE MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CANDY AND SODA -- WITH THE SOME NOW -- VALID POINTS SAID THAT TO YOU YOUR DEPARTMENT DOES. IS SO THAT THE ANNA BASED UPON -- YOUR ANALYSIS OF THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WHAT KIND WHAT. PROBLEMS THAT THAT WAS. WHETHER THAT'LL BE TOO MUCH WORK THOSE. TWO OF TOO SHORT. NO. OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE -- WATER ISSUES I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO TRY TO SOLVE WHEN THE LOCALLY -- SPORADICALLY HERE HAPHAZARD MASS THOUGHT THE THAN NOT COORDINATED I HAVE PHOTO LOCALLY THROUGH ISSUING BONDS SO -- SO THESE. ARE THE TWO PERCENTAGE SUGGESTION OUR DEDICATED TO EVERY EVERY YEAR THAT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LONG TERM. BASED UPON THE POPULATION GROWTH THE PROJECTIONS SO. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS A FAILING -- SO I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS SO GOOD THE LONG TERM ARE ESSENTIAL. PLANNING FOR OUR STATE. BUT THE SURPRISING ME -- THEY TOOK DIFFERENT POSITIONS SO THAT'S WHY. THAT'S WHY -- I THOUGHT THE YOUR DEPARTMENT SO. ANALYSIS OF THAT THE WEATHER THAT THE AMOUNT 22% IS A VALID. IT MAKES SENSE OR NOT THAT MAY HELP. YEAH I MEAN I GET AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A PRACTICE OF DOING ANALYSES OF EVERY SINGLE BILL BUT AT ME IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUESTS THAT COME TO US WE CAN LOOK AT THAT A DOCTOR. I TIRE OF I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHOR. OR AUTHORS OF THE BILL -- WHETHER IT BE SPECIFICALLY -- TO ACA THREE OR JUST IN GENERAL WANTING TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE OUTSTANDING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF THE STATE AND SO WE CERTAINLY WILL WILL CONSIDER THAT. AND I THINK WHEN WHEN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION TO AS AS AS AS I ALLUDED TO THE END OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WHAT IS THE SOLUTION NOT ONLY LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE NEEDS BUT WHAT IS THE FORECAST FOR THE GENERAL FUND IN THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW YOU'D WANT TO KIND OF LINE THOSE UP AS WELL [inaudible] HIS OFFICE. THANK YOU MISTER I WAS JUST GONNA KIND OF ASK. MAYBE TO HELP -- SOMEONE OVER TROY. OF THE BONDS THAT YOU LOOKED AT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEVERAL LISTED EVEN ON PAGE. TWO ONE TWO THREE FOUR THERE'S LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THAT OF THE THE BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED TO ME WHAT WAS. HOW LONG BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY FULLY UTILIZED? THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH SO. IT GENERALLY WELL THEY'RE GENERALLY KIND OF PAID OFF OVER THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS -- PARTLY THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USUALLY PAID ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS SO USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF YEARS TO GET THE PROGRAMS KINDA UP AND RUNNING AND THEN FOLKS APPLY FOR THEM AND THEN THEY GET THE GRANT AWARDS. AND THEN THEY UNDERTAKE THE PROJECTS AND THEN THEY GET PAID BACK. AND THEN THE STATE PAYS FOR THEM SO IT TYPICALLY IS YOU KNOW OF A FEW DECADES UNTIL THEY'RE ALL YOU CAN SEE HERE. I EVEN ON THIS CHART THERE ARE -- PROPOSITION THIRTEEN IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND SET AT TWO THOUSAND WAS PASSED BY THE OTERS THERE ARE STILL DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE BEFORE YOU IN JUNE OF SPENDING PROP THIRTEEN DOLLARS SO. IT TYPICALLY DOES TAKE -- SEVERAL YEARS FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO GET FULLY UTILIZED. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH PROP ONE THAT JUST PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN NEARLY ALL OF THOSE DOLLARS NOT QUITE ALL OF THEM BUT MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS NOW SO I THINK THERE IS. CLEARLY A LOT OF DEMAND OUT THERE BUT IT DOES TAKE AWHILE FOR ALL THE DOLLARS TO GET KIND OF FULLY UTILIZED. GOT IT MAYBE THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. OF THE STATE KIND OF INFORMING OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. ABOUT -- THE HUGE NEED. SO I GUESS ONE THING FOR US TO CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS THE DEBT SERVICE THAT WERE PAYING ON THE BONDS AS OPPOSED TO A DIRECT ALLOCATION. FOR INVESTMENT APPRECIATE THAT I THINK UP WITH ANY THAT'S PART OF THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THAT CONVERSATION RIGHT. IS TO THE BILL DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF HOW WE'RE PAYING FOR IT RIGHT -- WHETHER OR NOT -- IT'S FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO CONTINUE. TO USE THE SAME PRACTICE BUT THAT WAS THE PRIOR CONVERSATION AND AND NOW. WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS I I DID HAVE A QUESTION AND AT WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK -- THE ALLEY OLD OFFICE IS IN A GOOD POSITION -- TOO BUT ANALYZE -- VIA A REQUEST YOU KNOW -- D. DIRECT -- ALLOCATIONS -- BY [inaudible] YELP POPULATION BY REGION -- BY NEED AND THERE'S ALWAYS THIS QUESTION. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? NEW FUNDING MECHANISMS ARE NEW BONDS WELL WE ALREADY FUNDED THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR QUITE OFTEN WE WE ALREADY FUNDED THAT -- WE ALREADY -- DID THAT BUT IT NEVER MADE IT TO IT'S INTENDED -- PURPOSE SO I THINK AT SOME POINT AND DOUBT WHEN IS THE QUESTION. IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THE ALLEY -- TO LOOK AT UPON LIKE. SIXTY EIGHT RIGHT THE MOST RECENT ONE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT ITS INTENTION. AND ULTIMATELY IT'S OUTCOMES -- SO PLEASE CAN AT NIGHT HELP ME IT YEAH I THINK M. AND TO SOME REMEMBER SAUCES QUESTION IT DOES IS. PROBABLY TOO PREMATURE FOR PROP SIXTY EIGHT SINCE THOSE DOLLARS ARE STILL GETTING OUT THE DOOR -- YOU MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE EARLY FOR PROP ONE BUT WE COULD START SEEING SOME OF IT -- SOME OF THE EARLIER ONES MAYBE BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE SO LONG TO GET THE DOLLARS AND SO LOOKING AT WHAT PROJECTS WERE FUNDED WHERE WHERE THOSE PROJECTS FUNDED. DID THE PROJECTS -- ACHIEVE WHAT THEY INTENDED I THINK SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AND I AND I CAN'T RECALL FORGIVE ME IF IT WAS BEEN IN THIS WHEN I'VE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BUT SOME OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. HAVE STARTED ASKING -- REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE PARTICULARLY IN THE IN A CHANGING CLIMATE AND TRADITIONALLY WITH BONDS THE WAY WE HAVE EVALUATED THAT IS. YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS PROJECT DID YOU DO THE PROJECT YES CHECK DONE. BUT I THINK MOVING A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO SOME OF THE AREAS OF WHAT DID WE WHAT WERE OUR INTENTIONS AND DID WE ACHIEVE THOSE INTENTIONS IF WE WANT A PARTICULAR FOR SOME OF THESE ECOSYSTEM PROJECTS FOR LOOKING FOR MORE RESILIENT -- ECOSYSTEM AND FOR BEING RESTORING WETLANDS THAT WE WANT TO HELP -- BUT FOR WELL OKAY SO YOU RESTORE THE PROJECT BUT BUT DID ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME AND I THINK THAT GETS A LITTLE HARDER BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SAY DID YOU BUILD A WATER PLANT YES PEOPLE TO WATER PLANT WERE DONE. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AT SOME OF THAT OUTCOME BASED -- YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT MEASURES YOU HAVE TO BRING SCIENCE INTO A LOT MORE AND YOU HAVE TO PROBABLY HAVE SO MANY FOR ONGOING MONITORING SO. I THINK WE WOULD PROBABLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT NEW BONDS BUILDING THAT IN TO TRY AND START LOOKING AT DID YOU NOT JUST SAY WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO BUT DID YOU DO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO AND AND YOU. HAVE TO STRUCTURE THAT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY I THINK. OF COURSE. THIS BILL OF JUST HAVING WORKED ON ONE OF THOSE WATER BONDS AND AND KNOWING. WHAT YOU JUST SAID THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL REALLY WANTED TO GET DOWN BUT? COULDN'T GET THAT DONE OR SIGNED. BY THE GOVERNOR IF WE PUT THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN THERE I THINK MR SOLACE IT'S IN A PRETTY SQUARE ON THE HEAD THERE. WE REALLY HAVE TO START LOOKING AT A MORE PROACTIVE DEDICATED BAND OF FUNDING SOURCE -- FROM THE FROM THE GENERAL FUND IF YOU WILL I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIR WAS TRYING. TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE AT AS MR QUIRK IS MENTIONED AND OTHERS MENTIONED EARLIER. WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE BALLOT BOX -- FOR EVERYTHING WE DO WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE PROBLEM IS WE DON'T HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO CONTROL. WE TEND TO SHIFT OUR PRIORITIES. WITH THE WHIMS OF WHATEVER'S HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT. FORGETTING THINGS WHICH OFTEN CAUSES INCREASES IN COSTS. WHICH CAUSES US TO RUN OUT OF MONEY THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO BEGIN WITH. SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED -- DISCUSSION HERE. BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF BRIGHT MINDS. IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN SIT DOWN AND HAVE A SYSTEMATIC LOGICAL DISCUSSION AND ACTUALLY PUT THIS TOGETHER. ON A FROM A BIG HOLISTIC PICTURE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU COULD CONSIDER IT CONCEPTUALLY IS IF YOU'RE UNDERTAKING A LARGE PROJECT IN YOU NEED KIND OF A BIG UP FRONT AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH USUALLY IS WHAT WE AS BONDS. FOR THEN PAIRING IT WITH AN ONGOING STREAM THAT COULD LOOK AT SOME OF THAT NOT ONLY THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUT ALSO SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC MONITORING AND THINKING ABOUT THOSE KIND OF IN COMBINATION. IF WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A FUN SOURCE WHICH KEEPS US IN CHECK SO THAT WE DON'T GET. BEHIND AS WE ARE CURRENTLY TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER GELLER. SO I I KNOW SO WE WE CAN OUTLINED SEVERAL DIFFERENT. TYPES OF FUNDING SOURCES -- ONE ONE THAT I WAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS WHAT IF WE DID ALLOW LOCALS TO KEEP MORE OF THEIR SALES TAX -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT CONCEPT BUT MAYBE IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE ANOTHER. WAY TO HELP FUND SOME OF THESE. MANY OF THEM ARE YOU USUALLY LOCALLY FOCUSED ALTHOUGH THEY DO HAVE. A STATEWIDE IMPACTS AS WE NOW. BUT THAT MIGHT AT LEAST ALLOW THEM TO KIND OF KEEP SOME OF THEIR OWN MONEY THAT'S BEING GENERATED LOCALLY AND PUT INTO THESE PROJECTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS ANALYZE IT ALL WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THAT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S SPENDING THAT'S COMING TO THE STATE NOW AND IT. STOPS COMING TO THE STATE IT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STATE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY RELYING ON IT BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE NUMEROUS OPTIONS. UP FOR REVENUE STREAMS AND AND AGAIN I THINK WE WOULD SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT. THE STATEWIDE VERSUS LOCAL NEXUS IS PROBABLY A ONE HELPFUL TOOL YOU COULD USE AS A WEIGHING THOSE OPTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WE APPRECIATE YOUR WAYS -- A STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE. FOR OUR PURPOSES OF INFORMING. A PROCESS OR THE LEGISLATURE IN GENERAL ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE NEXT PANEL TO COME UP. I THINK THAT THAT TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO SET UP BY A POWER POINT THOUGH FOR BOARD PRESENTATION -- SO WE WILL -- GIVE THEM SOMETIME BY THE SET UP ALL RIGHT I THINK -- WE'RE JUST BY YEAH I THINK SO OKAY. THANK YOU. SIR. JIMMY JUST CLICK ON OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR FOR HAVING US HERE I'M I'M ELLEN HANNEKE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE WATER POLICY CENTER AT PUBLIC POLICIES TO CALIFORNIA I'M HERE WITH TWO OF MY GOOD FRIENDS AND AND CO AUTHORS ON THIS. ON THIS WORK THAT WE'RE TO BE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SARGE GREEN FROM FRESNO STATE AN AND TIMES HARDER FROM. FROM UC DAVIS AND UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND OTHER THINGS -- TOO REVEALED I I'LL GET IT WRONG IF I IF I DON'T LIST THEM ALL BUT SO SO WHAT WHAT WE ARE ARE ARE GOING TO DO IS GIVE YOU UP A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW OF THIS. STUDY THAT WE THAT WE JUST CAME OUT WITH A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THIS IS BEEN PART OF A THREE YEAR EFFORT. ON THAT A TEAM OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TO LOOK AT THE THE WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY CHALLENGES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND AND LOOK FOR SOME PROMISING SOLUTIONS AND SO I JUST -- WANTED TELL YOU WHAT YOU'VE GOT IN FRONT OF YOU THANK YOU THERE ISN'T THERE'S A OVERVIEW PIECE THIS ALSO EXISTS IN SPANISH -- THE KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS ALL OF THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT -- YOU'VE GOT ALSO THE SLIDE THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW -- YOU GOT A COUPLE OF PIECES OF WRITTEN TESTIMONY FROM SERGEANT MYSELF AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE FOR ANYBODY WHO WHO LIKES OF PAPER. THIS IS ALL AVAILABLE ONLINE BUT WE HAVE THE FULL COPY OF THE REPORT WHICH WHICH CAN BE USEFUL HAS A LOT OF GREAT GRAPHICS IN IT SO HAPPY TO TO LEAVE SOME OF THOSE WITH YOU. I'M SO LET ME JUST KICK OFF FOR YOU I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE THE THE THE TEAM REALLY QUICKLY THIS WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. BETWEEN OUR ORGANIZATIONS FRESNO STATE UC DAVIS PP I SEE AS WELL AS YOU SEE MERCED AND POINT BLUE CONSERVATION SCIENCE. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM ANDWE WORKED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- WITH THE WITH THE GOT GOT A LOT OF GOOD GUIDANCE FROM AN ADVISORY GROUP OF FROM FOLKS AROUND THE VALLEY THIS IS NOT TO BLAME THEM FOR ANYTHING AT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THEY MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE WITH IT BUT THE BIT THEY PROVIDED. TO US WITHOUT A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK ALONG THE WAY AND GAVE US A YOU GET WE'RE GOOD SOUNDING BOARD AND AND WE REALLY APPRECIATED THAT. THAT INPUT FROM THEM -- SO THE THE BIG PICTURE IS THE YOU KNOW FOR TALKING ABOUT KIND OF WATER WATER CHALLENGES IN STATE THIS IS THIS IS REALLY GROUND ZERO IN IN IN A LOTTA RESPECTS -- FOR ADDRESSING MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE BECOMING THE IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE -- THIS YEAR THIS IS THE STATE'S LARGEST FARMING REGION OVER HALF OF OF ALL -- FARM GATE REVENUES ARE ARE FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE EIGHT VALLEY COUNTIES. A LOT IS AT STAKE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY FOR THE REGION'S ECONOMY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE ENVIRONMENT -- AND WE FIND THAT THE MOST PROMISING APPROACHES OUR APPROACH IS THAT REALLY HELP INCREASE FLEXIBILITY. TO MANAGE THE WATER AS AS AS BEST AS POSSIBLE PROVIDE INCENTIVES ESPECIALLY TO LANDOWNERS IN GROWERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE. ON THIS SORT OF FRONT LINE IN TERMS OF OF MANAGING THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. ACT IMPLICATIONS APPROACHES THAT LEVERAGE MULTIPLE BENEFITS THE TRY TO KIND OF STACKED STACKED DIFFERENT BENEFITS WITH WITH -- ONE YOU KNOW ONE ONE KIND OF INVESTMENT ARE ARE GOING TO BE MORE MORE IMPORTANT AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF THAT. AND THEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING AS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES GOING TO HAVE TO BE LED BY. FOLKS IN THE REGION ARE AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO BEST WITH COOPERATION AND COORDINATION. BUT THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE REALLY REALLY KEEP PARTICIPANTS SO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF WHERE IN PARTICULAR THE STATE CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL. SO -- BIG CHALLENGES ARE WHAT ONE OF THEM IS WATER SUPPLY AND THIS IS A MAP OF THE OUT BASINS THAT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. AND DEVELOP PLANS TO ADDRESS GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY EVERY BASE AND THAT'S SHOWN UP THERE IN AN ORANGE OR IN YELLOW -- IS CONSIDERED PRIORITY AND HAVE HAS TO A REPLY THAT THE RESPONSE TO THIS -- THE VALLEY IS MOSTLY IN ORANGE THERE YOU CAN SEE AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL MOST OF THESE BASES ARE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BY THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES WE ESTIMATE THAT. THE LONG TERM DEFICIT IS ABOUT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET A YEAR ARM WHICH CORRESPONDS TO ABOUT 11% OF NET WATER USE IN THE IN THE WHOLE BASE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSEQUENCES OF THIS THAT ARE THAT ARE -- IMPACTING. CREATING HARM IN THE VALLEY DR WELLS BOTH DRINKING WATER AND IRRIGATION WELLS WE SAW THIS A LOT DURING THE LAST ROUTE SINKING LANDS WHICH IS AFFECTING INFRASTRUCTURE. A LOT OF THE BIG CONVEYANCE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN JUST READ CONCERN ABOUT REDUCE SUPPLIES FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS BECAUSE GROUNDWATER IS IT IS A GREAT DROUGHT RESERVE WHEN THE SURFACE WATER. IS NOT AS A PLANET FULL GROUNDWATER REALLY COMES IN HANDY NOW THE VALLEYS ON A FAST TRACK OF FOR IMPLEMENTING SIGMA BECAUSE THE THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO GET THEIR PLANS IN FIRST. THOSE PLANS ARE DUE IN TWO OF THE PART OF WATER RESOURCES IN JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY AND BASICALLY THE TWENTY TWENTY YOUR TIME LINE TO TO IMPLEMENT AND ATTAIN SUSTAINABILITY -- AND THE MASS OF THIS IS IS A SIMPLE IN A WAY THE SOLUTIONS ARE TOUGH BUT THE MATH IS SIMPLE IF YOU'RE IN AN OVERDRAFT BASIN. YOU'VE GOT TO EITHER FIND MORE WATER ADD SUPPLY. OF OR USE LESS OR PROBABLY IN A LOT OF THESE BASE IN SOME COMBINATION AND SO -- THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE SOME SHORT TERM COSTS EVEN THOUGH THE LONG TERM IMPLEMENTATION OF CIGNA IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THIS REGION BECAUSE THAT MEANS THE READ THE RESOURCE WILL BE THERE. FOR FOR THE GENERATIONS TO COME AND SO WE LOOKED AT HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT COULD BE. A LEASE PAINFUL AND AND MOST BENEFICIAL SO THAT'S THE SUPPLY SIDE NOW. THE SUPPLIES THAT HAS TO BE MATCHED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE QUALITY SIDE AND EVEN. THOUGHT I KNOW TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER -- CHALLENGE THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN THIS VALLEY TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE MAPS OF THAT IN A MOMENT -- BUT THEY'RE ALSO JUST LONG TERM ISSUES OF AND WE WE WE'RE WE'RE% ARGUING THAT PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER JUST AN URGENT THING THAT WE JUST HAVE TO DO. PRONTO ARM AND THEN BUT THEY'RE ALSO LONGER TERM WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDING NITROGEN LOADING WHICH IS A YOU KNOW AN ISSUE IN ANY AGRICULTURAL AREA. OF THEIR SOME NITROGEN THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE TO THE GROUND WATER AND IN PARTS OF THE VALLEY IT'S VERY VERY HIGH -- AND CAUSES CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER AND THEN MANAGING LONG TERM SALT BALANCE WHICH IS AN ISSUE FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY. SO THERE ARE POTENTIAL SYNERGIES IN MANAGING OF FIRST OF SUPPLY GROUND WATER BALANCE AND AND FOR MANAGING QUALITY BUT THEY'RE ALSO SOME POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RECHARGING GROUNDWATER WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN A MOMENT. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT OUR THE AS REALLY FORTHCOMING AND TALK ABOUT DRINKING WATER QUALITY IN THE LONG TERM WATER QUALITY AS SEPARATE ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF POLICY SOLUTIONS THE FOURTH KIND OF AREA WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU A LITTLE BIT IS THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU GET BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE IN NATURE IN THE MIDST OF THIS TRANSITION ESPECIALLY. WHEN -- RECOGNIZING THAT SOME LAND IS LIKELY TO COME OUT OF PRODUCTION AS PART OF DEMAND MANAGEMENT. IN THE VALLEY AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD MEAN IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL DUST ADDITIONAL PASS ADDITIONAL WEEDS ARE BAD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BAD FOR NEIGHBORING FARMS -- AND SO INTEREST IT VERY EARLY DAYS OF INTEREST IN LOOKING AT HOW DO WE MANAGE THAT THOSE DECISIONS IN WAYS THAT ARE. ARE GOING TO BE AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE AND AND PROVIDE AS MUCH VALUE TO THE VALLEY SO LOOKING FOR MULTI BENEFIT APPROACHES HEALTHY SOILS MANAGEMENT WHICH COULD GENERATE CREDITS FOR FOR CARBON CAPTURE -- HABITAT OF SOLAR INCLUDING WILDLIFE FRIENDLYSOLAR RECHARGE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT THING TO TO LOOK AT IN SOME PLACES FLOOD PROTECTION RECREATION THESE ARE ALL THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF MANAGING MANAGING LAND AND WATER RESOURCES. SO I'M GOING TO JUST WALK THROUGH FOR YOU. THESE FOUR AREA FOR PRIORITY AREAS FOR ACTION. AND A LITTLE BIT OF KIND OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE KEY AREAS IN NEED IN EACH OF THESE HAT WE THINK. KIND OF NEAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN ORDER FOR FOR SICK FOR SUCCESS THE FIRST IS BALANCING WATER SUPPLIES AND DEMANDS SO THIS IS THIS ISSUE OF ADDRESSING THE LONG TERM GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT. AND WE LOOKED IN THIS STUDY AT PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY HAD EVER COME OUT WITH A REPORT ABOUT OR ANALYSIS ABOUT IN TERMS OF SUPPLY OPTIONS. WE LOOKED AT THOSE TO SEE HOW MUCH WATER COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE VALLEY FROM THAT BUT ALSO HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE IN PARTICULAR HOW MUCH OF THIS COULD BE AFFORDED. BY FARMERS WHO WILL BE THE THE PRINCIPAL FOLKS AFFECTED BY BY MANAGING. SIGMA JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE THE THE MAIN WATER USERS IT'S A IT'S A BIG BIG SECTOR IN THE VALLEY YOUR GATED AGRICULTURE WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE MAN MANAGEMENT OPTIONS BOTH FOR AGRICULTURE BUT ALSO IN THE URBAN SECTOR -- AS WELL AS WAYS TO INCREASE FLEXIBILITY AND JUST THE THE IDEA DOES THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHEN I WHEN I SHOW YOU NEXT GRAPH IS. THINKING ABOUT THAT THAT READ PART OF THAT DOUGHNUT THERE THE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT FEES -- EITHER YOU GOTTA FIND SUPPLIES TO FILL THAT. OR YOU'VE GOT TO REDUCE THE DONUTS. TO TO TO SHRINK THAT OVER TIME UNDER SIGMA. AND SO THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE FIND ON THE SUPPLY SIDE THIS IS LOOKING AT A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BOTH BIG AND SMALL. ARM IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THE BLUE BARS TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH WATER PHYSICALLY COULD BE AVAILABLE POTENTIALLY AT THE YOU KNOW THE MAXIMUM POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE ON AN ANNUAL AVERAGE. OF FROM FROM THESE FROM THESE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND THE YELLOW IS THE IS THE PORTION THAT WE THINK OF IT FARMERS ARE LIKELY TO BE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD AND AND WILLING TO PAY -- FOR RATHER THAN WRAP IT IN IN THE IT ISSUE BEING IF IT'S MORE COSTLY THAN THAT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MAKING ENOUGH MONEY IN THERE FOR IN THEIR FARMING FROM IT AND SO THEY WOULD THEY WOULD NOT BE AS INTERESTED IN INVESTING. IN YOU STARTING TO SEE THE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING ACROSS THE VALLEY IN TERMS OF WHAT. OF WHAT FOLKS ARE WILLING TO INVEST IN SO I'LL JUST WALK YOU THROUGH REALLY QUICKLY KIND OF WHAT THE WHAT THE BIG. THE BIG CATEGORIES ARE CAPTURING AND STORING MORE MORE LOCAL RUN OFF THIS IS THIS KEY ISSUE OF WINTER AND SPRING FLOOD FLOWS SOME OF IT IS NOT. A REQUIRED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SOME OF IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR DOWNSTREAM WATER USERS -- CAN WE CAPTURE MORE OF THAT AND GET THAT. INTO THE GROUND. ESPECIALLY BUT YOU KNOW ALSO ALSO WINS IN SURFACE RESERVOIRS WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BIGGEST. AFFORDABLE POT OF WATER -- ABOUT BE MET IN THAT WAY ESPECIALLY WITH GROUND WATER RECHARGE. THE SECOND BIG CATEGORY THERE IS INCREASING RUN OFF WITH UPPER WATERSHED MANAGEMENT. YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S A BIG BLUE BAR THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF POTENTIAL WATER UP THERE BUT THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE IF YOU JUST ARE THINKING ABOUT AS INVESTMENT FOR WATER ALONE. THIS IS YOU KNOW MANAGING YOUR HAD WATER FOR US TO TO INCREASE RUN OFF. THE THIRD IS INCREASING DELTA IMPORTS AND THERE WE LOOKED AT CAL CALIFORNIA WATER FIX WE LOOKED AT SITES RESERVOIR WE LOOKED AT SHASTA. A VARIETY OF THINGS AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THERE'S MOST OF THOSE BIG PROJECTS ARE KIND OF EXPENSIVE ON A PER ACRE FOOT BASES FOR FARMERS. AND WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN MANY PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR THAT IN THE VALLEY EITHER SO THAT WE DO THINK THOUGH THERE'S SOME COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL. TO MANAGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN A MORE COORDINATED FASHION AND AND GET SOME GET SOME GET SOME ADDITIONAL WATER OUT OF THAT THE OTHER THE OTHER CATEGORIES ARE PRETTY SMALL IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL OF SKIP OVER THOSE BUT WE CAN COME BACK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. SO THINK ABOUT THIS AS ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE DEFICIT CAN BE MET WITH AFFORDABLE NEW NEW SUPPLIES THAT MEANS THAT ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE DEFICIT HAS TO BE MET THROUGH DEMAND MANAGEMENT OR WILL LIKELY HAVE TO BE MET THROUGH DEMAND MANAGEMENT. AND THE MAIN WAY THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN IS WITH SOMEWHAT WITH CROP SHIFTING BUT ESPECIALLY WITH TAKING SOME LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION. ARM AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY ASIAN EFFICIENCY DOES NOT REALLY GET YOU MUCH IN THE WAY OF NET WATER SAVINGS WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED. FOR BASE AND BALANCING YOUR CATION EFFICIENCY HAS ALL KINDS OF OTHER ADVANTAGES BUT IT'S NOT A GREAT STIGMA TOOL. SO WHAT THESE LITTLE BAR SHOW YOU IS JUST A COMPARISON OF HOW TO MANAGE. THAT DEMAND IN WITH. INFLEXIBLE OR FLEXIBLE WATER. USE AND THE THE MOST INFLEXIBLE INFLEXIBLE BAR THAT GRAYBAR AS ARE THE I GUESS IT'S BROWN -- THAT IS IF BASICALLY FARMERS IN A BASIN THAT HAS LET'S SAY 25% OVER DRAFT WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE ESTIMATING ROUGHLY IN KERN. ARM IF EVERYBODY JUST HAS TO CUT EVERY CROP BY EXACTLY 25%. YOU DON'T MAKING CHOICES OF OKAY I'M GOING TO LEAVE MORE WATER FOR A MORE PROFITABLE CROP AND LESS FOR ANOTHER -- THAT IS THAT THAT'S THE MOST COSTLY BY FAR AND WE ESTIMATE YOUR RELATIVE TO CUT CURRENT CONDITIONS THAT WOULD COST ABOUT. A LOSS OF REVENUES OF ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU JUMP TO THE NEXT -- THE ORANGE THERE THAT IS A MATTER OF ALLOWING FOR LOCAL WATER TRADING FLEXIBLE WATER USE BOTH SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER WITHIN THE BASINS WITHIN THE GROUNDWATER BASIN SO LOCALLY -- THAT CUTS THE REVENUE LOSSES ALMOST IN HALF. JUST BY GIVING THAT FLEXIBILITY TO TO TO USE THE WATER WHERE IT IT'S BRINGING IN THE THE MOST REVENUES. ON PROFITS -- AND THEN THE THE OR THE YELLOW IS WHEN YOU ALSO HAVE VALLEY WHY TRADING WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SAME WATER BUDGET BUT JUST ALLOWING SURFACE WATER TO MOVE AROUND. FROM SOME OF THE BASINS THAT DON'T HAVE A BIG OVERDRAFT PROBLEM TO THE TO SOME THAT DO. AND THEN THE BLUE IS KIND OF THE OF IT ARE NOW SAYS THE SWEET SPOT THAT'S THE COMBINATION OF THE FLEXIBLE WATER MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH THOSE SUPPLY INVESTMENTS AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT THAT. BRINGS THE THE REVENUE LOSSES DOWN THERE ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH INFLEXIBLE WATER USE AND NO SUPPLY INVESTMENTS. THAT'S ALSO THE ONE THAT REALLY REDUCES LAND FOLLOWING BECAUSE THAT JUST MEANS MORE WATER IS AVAILABLE TO APPLY. TO TO THE CROP SO THE ESTIMATES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM OUR STUDY OF AT LEAST HALF A MILLION ACRES THAT WE ANTICIPATE MAY NEED TO GO OUT OF CROP OF YOUR GATED. CROP PRODUCTION THAT'S THAT BLUE BAR IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES IF THERE'S NOT NEW SUPPLIES WERE LOOKING MORE LIKE. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SO THE OTHER -- THING TO NOTE IS THAT THESE THINGS THESE MORE FLEXIBLE STRATEGIES AND THE NEW SUPPLIES -- YOU COMBINE THOSE THAT'S GOOD NOT ONLY FOR FARMERS IN IN TERMS OF CROP REVENUES IT ALSO IS IS GOOD FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMY IN IN A MORE GENERAL WAY WE LOOKED AT BOTH THAT BEEF AND AND DAIRY. AT DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING AND AND KIND OF THE ECONOMICS OF THAT NOT JUST FROM THE FORMER PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM. REGIONAL A G. P. AND ALSO FOR IT FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE A JOBS IT'S JUST BETTER. TO TO KIND OF USE THIS PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO TO REDUCE THE COSTS THE OTHER KEY FLEXIBILITY TOOL THAT FOLKS ARE IMAGINING OR ENVISAGING USING IN THE VALLEY IS WHAT THEY'RE CALLING A GLIDE PATH. THIS IS THE IDEA THAT YOU DON'T. OVERNIGHT AND OVERDRAFT YOU TAKE YOUR TWENTY YEARS TO AND GRADUALLY GET THERE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME TO ADAPT AND ADJUST AND KIND OF DO PILOT PROJECTS. TO TO SEE WHAT'S WORKING [inaudible] SO -- PRIORITIES THIS IS KIND OF A A LIST OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED TO MAKE THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. A PORTFOLIO WORK THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED FOR YOU HERE THE ONES WITH STARS ARE WEIRD STATE AND FEDERAL ACTION ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. THAT'S IN HELPING TO ASSESS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WHERE ARE THE GOOD INVESTMENTS THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE FOLLOW ONS TO THE DISCUSSION YOU HAD ON FUNDING THIS MORNING IS HOW TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THE LIST OF POTENTIAL PROJECTS IS WAY BIGGER THAN THAN THE MONEY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO SO WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK -- NUMBER FOR CLARIFYING HOW MUCH WATER IS AVAILABLE FOR RECHARGE THIS KIND OF THE THE LEGAL QUESTION AND THAT'S REALLY. ONE WHERE THE STATE NEEDS TO TO PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT NEW LEADING ROLE AND THEN NUMBER FIVE IS FACILITATING APPROVALS FOR TRADING AND BANKING PROJECTS THAT'S USING STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE. TO TO MAKE SOME OF THESE. THESE DEALS HAPPEN -- AND THEN YOU KNOW IT WORKING WITH LOCALS ON SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS I THINK TO THE HELP THAT HELP ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN. THEIR OWN -- NCENTIVES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO NEXT IS INSURING SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKINGWATER AND IF THE VALLEY IS GROUND ZERO FOR GROUND WATER OVERDRAFT AND SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. IT'S ALSO GROUND ZERO FOR THE SAFE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS BOTH A QUALITY ISSUE AND A SUPPLY ISSUE I HEARD ABOUT YOU REPORTER BILL THIS MORNING. THAT'S ON THE SUPPLY SIDE THAT THAT WOULD BE -- EIGHT A IS THE JUST LOOK A LOOK AT COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH A VERY IS MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LIMITS THIS IS MATT FROM JULY OF LAST SUMMER -- THERE WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL DOTS ON THERE FOR ONE TO THREE T. C. P. NOW AS WELL AND WHAT WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED THE THEY'RE THE EIGHT VALLEY COUNTIES. OVER HALF OF ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE ARE ARE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL AND MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN OUT OF COMPLIANCE FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS SO IT'S A IT'S NOT JUST THE A BLIP KIND OF PROBLEM WITH A CHRONIC PROBLEM. AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT MATT B. THIS IS THE DAY THAT THE STATE COLLECTED DURING THE DROUGHT OF SYSTEMS MOSTLY SYSTEMS WAS SHALLOW WELLS THAT THAT WERE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE. TO A TWO GOING DRY WHEN THE GROUND WATER LEVELS WERE FALLING THE THE BLUE IS THE HOUSEHOLD THAT REPORTED TO THE STATE WEBSITE ABOUT HAVING SHORTAGES WITH WITH THEIR DOMESTIC WELLS. AND THE ORANGE IS SMALL SAYS OR SYSTEMS THAT REQUESTED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS HALF OF THOSE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SUPPLY SHORTAGES IN THE VALLEY AGAIN YOU KNOW FAMILIAR PATTERN WE THINK THAT HALF OF THE THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN TROUBLE AND THEN ALMOST 80% OF THE WELLS REPORTED DRY AND WE KNOW THIS IS AN UNDER REPORT BECAUSE IT WAS A JUST A VOLUNTARY THING WASN'T COLLECTED EVERYWHERE. UP OVER 80% IN THE VALLEY SO THIS IS A THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO BE. PERSISTENT IN FUTURE DROUGHTS AND ALSO SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AND THE THE THE JEEP THE GROUNDWATER SENSIBILITY AGENCIES WILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AS THE IMPLEMENT A GLIDE PATH. BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GONNA ALLOW SOME CONTINUED OVERDRAFT THEY'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT. SO HERE'S HERE THE TOP PRIORITIES AND SARGE IS GOING TO BE IS IS IS IN THE TRENCHES ON THIS -- IT IN IT IN THE VALLEY AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS TO SHARE BUT THESE ARE KIND OF SOME TOP PRIORITIES. YOU SEE THAT I'VE GOT LITTLE RED STARS THERE ON ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THE STATE HAS TO JUST PLAY A MAJOR ROLE RECOGNIZING THAT. A LOT OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE GONNA HAVE TO INVOLVE VARIOUS LOCAL PLAYERS URBAN WATER SYSTEMS YOUR CATION DISTRICTS COUNTIES AND SO ON BUT THE STATE REALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE SOME LEADERSHIP HERE -- THERE IT WOULD AND WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL SO THE INSURER FINDING IS AN A IS A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE IT'S ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THEY DO THIS ON THE GROUND. AND GETTING AN ACTION PLAN -- THIRD AREA I'M GONNA TOUCH ON IS THIS LONG TERM WRONG GROUND WATER QUALITY CHALLENGES -- WHICH IS YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY AN ISSUE FOR FOR AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT. OF NITRATE BEING BEING A KEY ONE THERE IS A A A A A NEW REGULATORY PROGRAM NOW EVEN OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO WE'VE BEEN. WORKING TO TO TO REGULATE GROUNDWATER CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A LEADER ON THIS RELATIVE TO MANY OTHER STATES -- AND SO THAT IS THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ROUTE TO BOTH FOR DAIRIES AND FOR YOUR GATED LANDS TO LOOK AT AT NITROGEN AS WELL AS AS WELL AS AT FAULT -- IF THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS MADE IN IN SOME WAYS BUT THIS IS A HARD AND IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD FOR DAIRIES WHICH IS WHAT I'M HIGHLIGHTING FOR YOU HERE -- THERE'S JUST ALL TOO MUCH MINORE RELATIVE TO THE CROP LAND THAT DAIRIES HAVE AVAILABLE MENORES HARD TO MANAGE. EFFICIENTLY AND AND THERE'S NOW RECOGNITION THAT SOME OF THAT WOOD NOR HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE EXPORTED OFFER THE DAIRIES AND TRANSFORM TO BE USED IN SOME OTHER WAY SO. JUST AS A KIND OF INDICATOR OF THAT THE MAP A SHOWS YOU THE DERRY CROPLAND THOSE THOSE RED DOTS THERE. AND THAT ALMOST MAPS YOU KNOW ONE FOR ONE WITH THE THE REAL HOT SPOTS FOR NITROGEN LOADING YOU CAN SEE THE THE THE BRIGHT RED AND ORANGE THERE -- ABOUT 6% OF CROPLAND IS DERRY CROPLAND AND ALMOST 90% OF THE HOT THE HOTTEST HOT SPOTS IN NITROGEN LOADING ARE ARE ON THOSE CROPLANDS. SAYS IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT THIS THE SECTORS RECOGNIZING AND AND YOU KNOW TRUCK TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH AT THIS POINT. ON THE OTHER ISSUE IS SOLVED AND THEN THIS WHERE'S MY TRADE IS REALLY AN ISSUE FOR DRINKING WATER QUALITY. SALT IS REALLY AN ISSUE FOR AG PRODUCTIVITY -- MAP SHOWS YOU KIND OF THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER GROUNDWATER SALINITY AND THE OF THE WEST SIDE OF THE VALLEY HAS SOME HAS LONG TERMS ASSAULT ISSUES. THAT BAR CHART SHOWS YOU WHICH CROP START TO DECLINE YIELD THAT I WHICH LEVEL OF SALINITY AND A LOT OF THE HIGHER VALUE -- CROPS THAT ARE MOST QUICKLY AFFECTED BY SALINITY SO THIS IS A AN ONGOING CHALLENGE FOR AGRICULTURE AND THAT THE SOLUTIONS ARE THE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS ARE EXPENSIVE -- USE SOME OF THE BIG DE SALLE EFFORTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO WHAT FARMERS CAN AFFORD SO THIS IS AN ISSUE. FOR YOU WHERE FARMERS ARE OFTEN NOW REALLY USING ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. ALL RATHER THAN SORT OF THE THE THE BIG INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S MOST COST EFFECTIVE IN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TOOLS AS CROP SHIFTING THEIR OTHER THINGS YOU CAN DO ON THE FARM TO MANAGE AS BUT ALSO OVER TIME. SOME LAND IT COMES OUT OF PRODUCTION OF BECAUSE ASSAULTS ALREADY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF COME OUT OF PRODUCTION OVER TIME. AND THERE'S ANOTHER ESTIMATED I THINK ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION ACRES THAT ARE BETTER SALT IMPACTED SO SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF IT SOME LAND IT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION FOR WATER SUPPLY. THINKING ABOUT HOW TO COORDINATE THAT WITH WITH THE SALT MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER CAN BE FLEXIBLY MOVED. TO THE MOST PRODUCTIVE LANDS -- THEN AT ONE THING ALSO FLAG FOR YOU AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THOMAS CAN CAN AMONG OTHER THINGS THE THOMAS CAN TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT IS. HOW TO MANAGE QUALITY AND QUANTITY TOGETHER WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WHICH IS THE SIZE YOU KNOW THE BIG ONE OF THE BIG TOOLS FOR THE VALLEY IN TERMS OF A COST EFFECTIVE? OPTION FOR EXPANDING SUPPLY. ARM PUTTING RECHARGE ON CROP LAND IS A PRETTY GOOD OPTION FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A LOT OF CROP LAND IN THE VALLEY THAT HAS SUITABLE SOILS. THE FOLKS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS AND YOU KNOW FARMERS LIKE DON CAMERON FROM THE STATE BOARD OF FOOD A NAGGING OTHERS OF AN EXPERIMENT WITH THOSE FOLKS THAT YOU YOU SEE DAVIS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS I'M A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE. THE ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES BEYOND JUST KIND OF ARE YOU LEGALLY ENTITLED TO GET THE WATER AND ALL OF THOSE SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL THINGS. IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT. IMPAIRING WATER QUALITY IN WAYS THAT RUN AFOUL OF REGULATIONS WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A LOT OF WATER ON THE SOILS. YOU CAN END UP PUSHING NITROGEN DOWN INTO THE INTO THE WATER TABLE AND WHAT THIS CROP WE'LL SHOWS YOU HERE IS THAT. OF ALL THE SUITABLE SOILS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IT'S ABOUT HALF A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE YEAR GET A CROP LAND. IS SUITABLE -- ONLY THAT DARK BLUE PORTION IS KIND OF CONSIDERED CLEAN CROPS THAT. WERE YOU WOULDN'T AUTOMATICALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT ISSUE. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CROPS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY SUITABLE CAN TOLERATE OF THE THE RECHARGE BUT WERE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE NITROGEN MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S THAT WHOLE HALF THEIR OF OF THE GREEN THE GREEN THERE WITH ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS -- AT OTHER TREE CROPS AND SO ON SO SOMETHING TO SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHERE THE STATE IS GOING TO NEED TO HELP. PROVIDE SOME CLARITY ON THE REGULATORY SIDE ARM AND IN FACT THERE IS YOUR THESE ARE ARE ARE ARE SORT OF PRIORITIES A LOT IT'S HAS TO HAPPEN. AGAIN BY A LOCAL AND REGIONAL ACTORS BUT THE STATE CAN BE REALLY. IMPORTANT IN HELPING PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND SOME REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ON MANAGING THE LONG TERM NITROGEN SALT. ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE RECHARGE AND THE THE NEW SALT AND NITRATE CONTROL PROGRAM THAT THE REGIONAL BOARD HAS ADOPTED AND THAT IS STILL -- IS PENDING APPROVAL BY THE STATE WATER BOARD. HAS SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN ARM IN A WAY THAT KIND OF INSURERS THAT. AS LONG AS FOLKS ARE ADDRESSING SAFE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS URGENTLY -- THERE THEY PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR LONGER TERM LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS ON ON THE AG SIDE WHICH WOULD WHICH WHICH WE THINK IS THE IT IS IS A SMART APPROACH. SO LAST ONE THIS IS THIS IDEA OF KIND OF I DON'T KNOW I SOMETIMES CALLED MAKING LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS -- WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT SOME LAND IS LIKELY TO BE COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION. HOW TO MANAGE THAT IN WAYS THEY GET VALUE FOR THE VALLEY AS OPPOSED TO JUST CAUSING NEGATIVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES? OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE THERE'S NOT ANY WHERE NEAR THE KIND OF THINKING OR PLANNING THIS AWARENESS IS BEGINNING TO BE AWARENESS OF THIS ISSUE. BUT NOT NOT THE THOSE KIND OF SERIOUS PLANNING THAT'S NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT. HOW TO HOW TO AVOID A KIND OF FARM BY FARM YOU KNOW POSTAGE STAMP APPROACH TO THIS THAT DOESN'T GET VALUE FROM THE LANDS AND THIS PIE CHART? THIS DOUGHNUT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THAT HERE I'M LOOKING AT THE ARE ARE SORT OF LOW BALL ESTIMATE OF LAND COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION THIS IS IN THE IN THE SORT OF OPTIMAL APPROACH WHERE YOU GET NEW SUPPLIES SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVER. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THAT WOULD COME OUT OF PRODUCTION OVER OVER TIME. AND THE THE SMALLER LITTLE SLICES OF THAT DOUGHNUT THOSE ARE KIND OF THE THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW UNDER EXISTING PLANNING PROCESS THESE. UP COULD LIKELY FIT INTO SOME KIND OF SPECIFIC ACTIVITY THAT INCLUDES THERE'S A RECOVERY PLAN FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN DESERT WHICH WOULD BE ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES. MAYBE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF SOLAR -- IN THE COCKPIT OF ADDITIONAL SOLAR BEYOND WHAT'S BEEN DONE -- AND THEN A MAYBE TWENTY THOUSAND EACH OF RIPARIAN QUARTERS AND OR EXPANDING REPAIRING QUARTERS AND AND SOME MORE IN INTERMENT WETLANDS OF THE TYPE THAT YOU SEE IN THE CURRENT WATER BANK. WHICH IS A GROUND WATER BANK THAT THAT IS IT INTERMITTENTLY ALSO HOT REVERT BIRD HABITAT SO THIS WHOLE BIG TWO THIRDS OF THE OF THIS DONATH THE YEP THE GOLDEN PART. IS JUST IT'S NOT SPECIFIC LAND THAT WE'RE SHOWING HERE SO MUCH AS JUST THE IDEA THAT THERE'S MORE THAN FITS IN THOSE IN THOSE CATEGORIES SO FAR. WE THINK THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO STEWART ALL OF THESE LANDS IN BENEFICIAL WAYS AND SOME OF THAT CAN BE ROTATIONAL FOLLOWING WHERE YOU'RE IMPROVING SOIL HEALTH. GETTING SOME BENEFITS IN TERMS OF EVEN IMPROVING THE ABILITY TO RETAIN MOISTURE BUT ALSO STORING CARBON IN THE MEAN TIME BUT THEN PROBABLY YOU KNOW USING SOME OF THESE LANDS IN IN IN OTHER WAYS. TO TO KIND OF STACKED STACKED BENEFITS -- FOR BRINGING IN REVENUES FOR FOR GROWERS FOR LANDOWNERS BUT ALSO GETTING SOME YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND RECREATIONAL AND FLOOD CONTROL -- VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF BENEFITS FOR THE REGION. SO A PRIORITIES FOR THIS -- GOT TO START WITH SOME BROAD BASED PLANNING. IMPLEMENTING FLEXIBLE REGULATORY APPROACHES AGAIN THAT THING THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND BOOSTING TECHNICAL SUPPORT R. D. U. C. GOT I'VE GOT STARS ON ALL BUT THE TOP ONE THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THE STATE. DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY THERE JUST THE STATE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN LAND USE PLANNING IN IN THIS IS THAT'S A THAT'S A LOCAL AND REGIONAL THING. BUT WE THINK ACTUALLY THE STATE CAN BE IMPORTANT AS A SUPPORTER OF OF THAT. SO JUST TO WRAP UP WITH A FEW THOUGHTS ON YOU KNOW THIS IS A HUGE AGENDA AND IT'S NOT AN OVERNIGHT AGENDA OF FOR ALL OF THE THINGS I'VE TALKED ABOUT WHERE WHERE CAN YOU BE MOST HELPFUL. IN THE NEAR TERM THE FIRST ONE IS SAFE DRINKING WATER AND I THINK IT'S NOT JUST THE FUNDING IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THERE IS A A COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING BOTH THE THE QUALITY AND THE SUPPLY. ISSUES. THE SECOND IS SUPPORTING THE REGION'S TRANSITION TO GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AND THIS IS THINKING ABOUT IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THESE PLANS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE JUST. REALLY GEARING UP ARM HOW TO SUPPORT THAT SO. NUMBER ONE IS THE STATE GETTING ITS OWN REGULATORY. SILOS A LITTLE BIT ON THE SIDE LOAD SO THAT THERE CAN BE SUPPORT YOU KNOW FOR FOR WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT CHALLENGE AREAS. THE SECOND IS HELPING TO ASSESS SMART INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND THEN SUPPORTING PILOTS ON THE GROUND AND I THINK YOU KNOW FINANCIAL INCENTIVES CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL IN THAT KIND OF THING -- AS WELL AS TECHNICAL SUPPORT OUR INDIE. AND SUPPORTING PLANNING. AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOU AND WE'LL LEAVE YOU WITH SOME NICE A NICE PHOTOS AND WE CAN. MOVE ON TO THANK YOU DOCTOR THE REST ALL RIGHT WILL WANT -- TO THOMAS HARDER. YOU WANT ME TO GO NEXT. WELL MY FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON THE DRINKING WATER PIECE OKAY -- YOUR SERGEANT GREEN YES SIR -- INTERIM DIRECTOR FRESNO STATE CENTER FOR IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY AND I'M ALSO THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR THE WATER RESOURCES IN POLICY INITIATIVES WHICH IS HELD OUT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. AND ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT I'M WORKING ON THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- PROGRAM AT WPI IS TO HANDHOLD DAX THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING -- APPLICATIONS TO THE SYSTEM FOR A FINANCING SO -- FOR EXAMPLE I'M WORKING WITH -- A SMALL RURAL SCHOOL IN THE MANTI CARE AREA AS WELL AS THE CITY PORTOLA -- AND PICKING UP A COUPLE MORE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS -- THERE'S A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH THAT NOT ALL COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE LATER BUT I REALLY WANTED TO HELP YOU WITH IS IS THE NOTION THAT WE REALLY CAN FOCUS ON DEALING WITH SOME OF THE DRINKING WATER ISSUES ESPECIALLY. FOR THE SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT WERE NOTED IN OUR REPORT ON THE PP I SEE -- IN THE SOME LOOKING VALLEY ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE NON COMPLIANT -- UP A YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN DRINKING WATER SYSTEM. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW MANY ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BUT CLEARLY -- THAT'S A SPECIAL PROJECT THAT WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT AT TO HELP THEM OUT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SUSTAINABILITY -- AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE WANT TO FOCUS ON IS THE MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE DO GIVE TO THE SMALL COMMUNITIES. HAS A PRIORITY AND WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING IS IS THAT WE DO NEED TO PERHAPS PRIORITIZE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AS ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS THAT WE NEED TO FINANCE AND PERHAPS EVEN FAST TRACK PROCESS. TO GET THAT GOING SO WHERE ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY DOING -- WE NEED TO REPLACE SOME OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE OF THIS IN CALIFORNIA -- ESPECIALLY WHERE IT'S AT ITS END OF ITS USABLE LIFE AND BUT THAT'S ALSO LINKED TO DRINKING WATER SO YOUR SEEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PIPE THAT BLEW UP ON SUNSET BOULEVARD RIGHT -- THE I DID PART OF UCLA OF SO THERE'S SOME OLD STUFF IN THE GROUND SO WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IF THERE IS A WATER STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT DESIGNED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES WAS ALREADY MENTIONED EARLIER BY. MS EHLERS THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE PRACTICES THAT DELIVER QUANTIFIABLE RESULTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S OUTCOME BASED THAT SHE MENTIONED. SO -- TO TALK A LITTLE BIT THEN ABOUT -- SOME OF THIS OTHER SPECIFIC EXAMPLES THAT WERE WORKING ON AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF MORE PRIVATE WHETHER IT'S THE MOBILE HOME PARKS IN SOME CASES CAMPGROUNDS. THOSE ARE ALL WHAT THEY CALL NON TRANSIENT NON COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IN WATER SPEAK IN THE DRINKING WATER WORLD. SO THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND GET OUR ARMS AROUND WHO THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES WE MIGHT NEED TO MAKE TO HELP THEM OUT. ONE EXAMPLE IS IT WITH ANOTHER RECENT CONTRACT WE'RE WORKING ON IS THE CITY OF FRESNO IS GOING TO ACT AS A FOCAL POINT FOR HOOKING UP. SATELLITE SYSTEMS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE CITY OF FRESNO TO SEE WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT ARE THE COSTS GOING TO BE. SO IT'S KIND OF A OF A PATTERN OR A PRECEDENT SETTING PROCESS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN IT IS ONCE AGAIN THROUGH THE W. R.. T. I. PROCESS IN ADDITION THE CAMPUS AT FRESNO STATE IS ITS OWN WATER SYSTEM NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE DELIVER. BOTH ARE DRINKING WATER AND WATER TO OUR FARM -- IN WHAT PART OF THE GSA AND AND NOW WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT NOT ONLY TO DO RESEARCH ON RECHARGE BENEFITS BUT ALSO A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR OF CAMPUS IN KIND STAFF SERVICES. TO HELP OUR GSA WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES SO THE KIND OF PARTNERSHIPS I THINK ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT -- I'M INVESTED IN IS ALSO THE NOTION THAT WAS MENTIONED BY -- MS EHLERS A GNAT IS MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING -- WE NEED TO MORE INVESTMENTS IN IN THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY -- IT IN IN A GOOD SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE JUST LAST WEEK. WE HAVE AT THE FRESNO STATE CAMPUS AN INCUBATOR WERE FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO DO WATER AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGY INCUBATION. AT A COMPANY HAS ARRIVED AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM TO OUR PROCESS THAT CAN INSTANTANEOUSLY TEST FOR E. COLI. THESE THE ONE NUMBER ONE ANY INDICATOR OF BACTERIAL COMIC CONTAMINATION IN WATER USUALLY YOU HAVE TO SEND IT TO A LABORATORY TAKES TWENTY FOUR HOURS FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE YOU GET RESULTS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU CAN TEST IT INSTANTANEOUSLY AND THIS THING WORKS AND IT'S A CHIP. TO CHIP IN A HAND HELD DEVICE. SO WE THINK THAT. AN INVESTMENT IS ALSO PART OF THE SOLUTION TO SOME OF THE WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT WE HAVE FACING US IN CALIFORNIA -- ALONG. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO IS THAT WE WE NEED BETTER INTEGRATION IT'S SOME OF OUR AGENCIES AS WELL -- ONE OF THE IDEAS IS THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE ACTUAL TECHNICAL EXPERTS IN EITHER OF THE WATER BOARD OR DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES THAT ARE WHITE HAT PEOPLE THAT CAN ASSIST AND REVIEW AND LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT -- THE PROPOSAL FOR DEVELOPING A CYST SOLUTION TO A SYSTEM IS THE RIGHT. ONE AND THE EXAMPLE I POINT TO AN A TALKED ABOUT IN NUMEROUS PLACES YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT. IS LYNN THERE. WHEN THERE IS A SMALL COMMUNITY IN WESTERN FRESNO COUNTY THAT HAD A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR ARSENIC PLANT BUILT AND IT'S SITTING IDLE? BECAUSE THE CITY -- THE GIGA COMMUNITY RESIDENTS COULD NOT AFFORD. AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED IF WE HAD THE RIGHT ADVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO PLANT TO REMOVE ARSENIC NOT TO PUT A IT'S TO REMOVE OUR SHOT IT. TO GET I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YOU TO GET A LITTLE MORE YEAH IT WAS TO REMOVE OUR STICK AT AND IT AND IT'S IT'S BEEN A FAILURE. SO WE NEED SOME WHITE HAD PEOPLE IN SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT CAN ACTUALLY GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPER PROJECTS RATHER THAN JUST REGULATED AND RIGHT WE HAVE -- THE DIVISION A DRINK OF WATER CANNOT ADVISE PEOPLE ON WHAT TO USE -- I THINK THAT THE REAL BIG AREA THOUGH IS THE INSTITUTIONAL ASPECT AND WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A KIND OF A STRESS TEST. AND THAT STRESS TEST IS -- WHETHER OR NOT A SYSTEM HAS A NUMBER OF COMPLIMENTS NUMBER ONE IS DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY REPELLENTS. NUMBER TWO CAN THEY AFFORD OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS NUMBER. THREE CAN THEY RETAIN QUALIFIED OPERATORS NUMBER FOUR TWO THEY HAVE ASSET MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS. AND NUMBER FIVE IS CAN INVEST IN A SINKING FUND. ANY SMALL ORGANIZATION THEY CANNOT BEAT THAT STRESS TEST AND IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT EVEN FOR SOME LARGER SINKING FUND THAT'S A BANK ACCOUNT THAT REPLACES. MONEY FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE ADDED AT THE END OF IT USABLE LIFE. OKAY SO IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY EVERY YEAR BUT IT BUILDS UP OVER TIME SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING IS READY TO BE REPLACED AT TWENTY FIVE YEARS YOU HAVE THE MONEY. IT'S A SUSTAINABILITY FACTOR. SO I THINK THOSE REQUIREMENTS WILL FORCE IS TO LOOK AT ALTERNATE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF SMALL SYSTEMS AND ENJOY LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I THINK SOME OF THE MORE SUCCESSFUL ONES HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT WHERE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN BOARD BUT ON COMMON ISSUES. OF A LARGE EXPANSE OR PLANNING OR RETAINING QUALIFIED PEOPLE YOU CAN GET THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE CASE OF THE PRIVATE SIDE. IT'S PROBABLY ASSOCIATIONS OF SOME TYPE SO I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A LOGICAL MANAGEMENT PROCESSES FOR VARIOUS AREAS -- WHO'S IN THOSE AREAS AND ANALYZE THEM AND THEN GET THEM TO JOIN TOGETHER IN A PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US -- AN EXAMPLE THAT I'VE I'VE WORKED WITH ALREADY WAS -- CURSED HAS A HIGH SCHOOL YOU SOMEBODY HIGH SCHOOL IT JOINED UP WITH HILL VIEW WATER DISTRICT RECENTLY SO IT'S NO LONGER ITS OWN WATER SUPPLIER. SIMILARLY THE ONE THAT I WORKED ON IN MANTI KANAL GARDEN SCHOOL -- STILL FINISHING THE FAST PROCESS WITH THEM THEY'VE JOINED THE STADIUM ANTICA SO WE'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES ARE WORKING ON THIS ALREADY -- AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD LASTLY I HAVE TO ADMIT AND SAY WHAT I ALLUDED TO EARLIER. IS THAT CONTRACTS AND DISBURSEMENT ARE STILL TAKING TOO LONG. IT'S A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GET THROUGH AND ON EVEN AN ORGANIZATION LIKE OURS THE WATER RESOURCES POLICIES TO STRUGGLES TO GET CONTRACTS THROUGH SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST WITH GETTING SOME OF THESE SMALL SYSTEMS THROUGH THE PROCESS SO. THAT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT I THINK EXTERNALLY AS WELL. THANK YOU. SO MY NAME IS THOMAS HARDER I'M THE ARMORED M. HAGEN AND DOUBT TEAR FOR WATER MANAGEMENT POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND AND DAVIS I'M A PROFESSOR AND I'M ALSO. RUNNING THE CARPET OF EXTENSION PROGRAM ON GROUNDWATER AND AGRICULTURE AND IN THAT FUNCTION I'M ON THE BOARD FOR THE GROUND WATER RESOURCE ASSOCIATION AND WHAT EDUCATION FOUNDATION AND STAFF MET A COUPLE OF YOUR ARM ON THAT OCCASION -- I'M HERE MOSTLY TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN SORT OF THE TECHNICAL BEATS OF A LOT OF THIS REPORT. THROUGH MY COMPANY EXTENSION PROGRAM I WORK WITH THE GET IN LINE SORT OF TORY PROGRAMME COALITIONS WITH THE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS AND THE STATE WATER BOARD PROVIDING TECHNICAL ADVICE ON IRRIGATED LAND SORT OF HEART PROGRAM. ON A DAIRY ORDER INTO CENTRAL VALLEY I'M ALSO VERY ENGAGED IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS WHERE ARE WORSE SPECIFICALLY ENGAGED IN AN ORDER PART OF THE STATE WITH THIS YOU COUNTY BUT I ALSO DO. QUITE A BIT OF OUTREACH AND AND AND EXTENSION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL COAST IN AN ORDER AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. ON THAT V. WERE HERE SEVEN YEARS AGO 2% TO YOU TO THE LEGISLATURE THE REPORT. ON NITRATE IN A JULY LIKE BASIN AND AND THE SALINAS VALLEY THAT KICK MUCH OF THIS OFF THAT WAS ON REQUEST FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND THROUGH THE STATE WATER RESUSCITATED BOARD. ARM AND SO I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON BOTH THE GROUND WATER SUPPLY SIDE AND AND NITROGEN SALT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS WERE AFTER. THIS SHOW -- ELLEN HANNEKE YES -- SO A LOT OF WHAT YOU STRESSED IS GETTING MONEY. ARE FOR THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT NETWORK CURRENTLY TRYING TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO GET MONEY. FOR A SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE ALL AGREE THERE SHOULD BE MONEY -- QUESTION OF WHO YOU TAXED GET AT WHAT SORT OF RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO HELP WITH THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. SO. IT IS KIND OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE AS AS THE SELLERS WAS SAYING YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE. A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THAT WHAT ONE CAN USE AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A HARD AND FAST RULE ON WHICH IS RIGHT FOR FOR WHICH BUT I'LL GIVE YOU MY PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THIS -- WHICH IS THAT -- A LOT OF IS THAT WHAT OUR USERS CURRENTLY PAY. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OF THE INVESTMENTS AND THE THE OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT FOR FOR WATER USE -- AND THE WAY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY AND KIND OF ENDING OVERDRAFT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OF ASSUMING THAT FARMERS AND AND AND CITIES WHAT WILL WILL CONTINUE. TO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY TO TO PAY FOR FOR THEIR OR THEIR WATER SUPPLIES -- AND THE GSA'S AROUND OR STAND ABILITY AGENCIES DO HAVE. THE AUTHORITY THE THE LEGISLATION GRIP -- LEGISLATION GRANTED THEM THE AUTHORITY TO TO RAISE. FEES FOR INVESTMENTS I THINK YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT MANY OF THEM HAVE. HAVE BEEN KIND OF FIGURING OUT -- THERE IN IT IN EARLY DAYS ON THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL ALSO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THEIR PROJECTS THAT THEY WANT TO INVEST IN BUT THERE ARE OPTIONS THAT INCLUDE. ASSESSMENTS OF THE LAND WHICH IS HOW SOME IRRIGATION DISTRICTS ALSO -- RUN YOU KNOW COLLECT COLLECT THEIR REVENUES NOW ON BUT THERE'S ALSO AN OPTION OF HAVING A GROUND WATER PUMPING FEE THAT COULD BE USED TO TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS SO -- WENT IN THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE SHOWING YOU FOR FOR KIND OF THE QUARTER OF SUPPLIES THAT COULD BE. AFFORDABLY PAID -- FOR THAT'S THAT'S ASSUMING USER USER PAYS ON THAT AND IT'S IT TO MY MIND. IN A WORLD OF LIMITED STATE RESOURCES WHERE THE STATE CAN BE MOST HELPFUL IS. IN AND HELPING TO JUMPSTART. INNOVATIONS KIND OF PROVIDING INNOVATION FUNDS SORT OF SUPPORTING PILOTS THAT WE CAN KIND OF CAN HELP GET PEOPLE TO A TRYING SOME NEW THINGS BUT THEN ALSO FINDING THESE ORPHAN AREAS WHERE. THERE'S NOT. THERE'S NOT THAT KIND OF IT'S NOT AS EASY TO GET USER PAY AND AND SO THINGS LIKE KIND OF HOW TO MANAGE -- HOW TO MANAGE SOME OF THE THE THE THE LANDS ON HOW TO DO SOME OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND SO ON -- ARE AREAS WHERE I WOULD. I WOULD SORT OF SAYARE ARE KIND OF ON THE TOP THE TOP LINE FOR FOR STATE FUNDING OKAY -- I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU'VE GOT A CONCRETE IDEAS WHICH YOU SEEM TO HAVE THAT YOU -- SEND US WELL LET'S SEE WE WE DO HAVE. HERE IN OUR WATER IN THE FUTURE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OVERVIEW AT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- I'VE GOT THE OVERVIEW SECTION HERE THE FIRST SIXTEEN PAGES -- IS THERE INFORMATION ON SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THIS THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA WHAT'S IN THE LEGISLATION MIGHT BE NECESSARY. THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME. IS SOME DIRECTIONS ON ON THINK AREAS WHERE THE STATE CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL WE HAVEN'T GONE TO THE LEVEL OF VERY SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND AND CERTAINLY NOT TO THE ON THE ISSUE OF FUNDING WE COULD WE COULD. THERE ARE SOME OF THAT OUT LOOK. NONE OF US. LEGISLATORS ARE EXPERTS. AND WHILE WE HAVE STAFF WHO ARE MUCH MORE EXPERT THAN WE ARE -- IT WOULD REALLY HELP TO HAVE SOME CONCRETE -- RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WOULD SAY THAT. TO ALL THREE OF YOU -- IF YOU COULD GIVE US CONCRETE REPRESENTATION WE NEED A LAW TO DO ARE WE NEED APPROPRIATIONS. FOR AND YOU COULD SEND THAT TO MYSELF AND CHAIRED GARCIA -- AND TO OUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. BUT THE KEY TO HELP US ROUTE REALLY HELP TO GET DOWN TO VERY CONCRETE PROPOSALS -- IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THIS -- OVERVIEW. BUT TO HAVE A CONCRETE PROPOSAL REALLY HELPS GET OUR MINDS ON THE ISSUE HOW MUCH WE CAN DO. I DON'T KNOW BUT IT WOULD REALLY HELP AND WE DEFINITELY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT HAS TO BE FOLLOWED -- TO BE -- TO HELP. GET SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER WHICH IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST IN THE LONG RUN. A TO MINIMIZE THAT'D BE GREAT AND THAT YOU'RE SAYING REQUIRES SOME STATE LEADERSHIP -- IT WAS -- WE HAD A REAL PROBLEM IN IT YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT. THIS GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS PASSED BY PEOPLE FROM CITIES. NOT FROM THE AREAS WHO ARE ACTUALLY BEING AFFECTED -- THEY DO NOT WANT TO TAKE. TAKE THE PAIN OF NOT -- OF TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR GROUND WATER. IT WAS A REAL SHAME THAT IT WAS DONE THAT WAY BUT THAT WAS THE WAY IT WAS ONE. AT ANY RATE -- WE REALLY DO NEED CONCRETE PROPOSALS AND HOW WE HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ONE OF THE CONCRETE PROPOSALS WE COULD POSSIBLY RECOMMEND IS THERE IS. A PROBLEM WE CALL CONNECTIVITY AND THAT IS A LOT OF THE LEGACY OLDER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE WATER. ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED WELL TO THE RECHARGE AREAS. SO THERE'S SOME PLANNING STUDIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE THAT COULD HELP TO ACTUALLY DEVISE A PLAN TO IMPROVE THOSE SITUATIONS. SO THAT WAS ONE AREA PERHAPS AND WE DID DISCUSS THAT IN IN THE PROCESS. THAT WE NEED. TO DIG FURTHER INTO THAT ONE AND ERIC SO AGAIN THE MORE CONCRETE YOU CAN MAKE IT THE MORE HELPFUL IT IS TO US THANK YOU. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I DO WANT TO JUST UP AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT -- MISS GREENE. PUTS FORWARD THAT IS A VERY REAL TIME -- DISCUSSION POLICIES. THE PRIOR HEARING YOU HEARD -- A POTENTIAL PROPOSAL ON ENSURING THAT THERE'S A STREAM OF FUNDING GOING. TO ADD THIS NEED ON A REOCCURRING BASIS. THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS OUT THERE ATTEMPTING TO DO THE SAME THING -- BECAUSE THERE'S OVER MILLION PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND YOU'VE POINTED OUT SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE MOST PREVALENT. THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT. ARE NOT AS I GUESS POINTED OUT IN THE MAPS BUT THAT STILL SEE THOSE PROBLEMS -- AND SO WE WANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THIS YEAR WERE WORKING COLLECTIVELY ON THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS -- AROUND THOSE ISSUES AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US SETTING UP UP MAYBE JUST ON ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE -- I THINK. WHO ARE ARE KIND OF COLLECTIVE THINKING ON THIS IS THAT THE FUNDING THE FUNDING IS AN ESSENTIAL PIECE? BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY WERE DRESSING. THE TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL SERVER SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND IS REALLY PIECEMEAL AND FRAGMENTED ARM AND AND WE'RE NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH I EITHER SO. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP IT YOU. TO TO TO KIND OF OF ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF A OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH BY THE STATE RIGHT NOW YOU'VE GOT THE STATE WATER BOARD DOING A PIECE YOU GOT THE PARTNER WATER RESOURCES DOING A PIECE. HERE THEY'RE THEY'RE SORT OF INITIATIVES. FROM DIFFERENT POCKETS OF OF OF FINDING -- AND IT'S HARD TO SEE. HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER IN IN A ROBUST WAY AND AND YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A? A ROBUST UP PROCESS IS IS SOMETHING I THINK WHERE THE THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AND I THINK AND HAVE A IF I CAN ADD TO THAT TOO NO I THINK. THIS PROGRAM THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS V. UC DAVIS AND THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF STATION LAST YEAR PUT OUT A WHITE PAPER ON HOW. TO SOME CONCRETE ACTIONS ON THE ON THE ON THE MASHEK FOR RECHARGED AND ADDING MORE RESEARCH INTO GROUND WATER WITH SOME OF OUR FLOODWATERS. ARM THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN. FOR WHAT TO CALL FLOOD MARK FLOOD MANAGE DOC FOR RECHARGE AND I'M EXPECTING THERE TO BE A FUND OF FUNDING PROPOSAL TO COME OUT OF THAT. IN A LARGE PICTURE BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OF OUR MANAGEMENT ACT IMPLEMENTATION AND WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WITH IRINA LINE SECOND TORY PROGRAMS ACROSS TO THE VARIOUS REGIONS THERE ARE THERE ARE CONTINUED NEEDS FOR THE STATE TO BE ENGAGED IN DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING AND SUPPORT. SUPPORT THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARM IN IN IN IN HELPING THEM WITH COLLECTING DATA INTERPRETING DOES DATA -- AND AND DOING THE MONITORING AND MODELING THAT WILL BE NEEDED AND SO I YOUR COMMENT IS RIGHT ON TARGET AND WILL BE. PROVIDING SOME FEEDBACK AND WE'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO ENABLE THE A A LARGE AREA -- TRADING -- WHAT'S LEGAL WHAT ISN'T. ETCETERA -- YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS WOULD HELP AND THEN -- ONCE WE HAVE A CONCRETE POST SO WE CAN WORK IT WITH THE STAFF HERE THEY CAN DO MORE RESEARCH BUT GETTING CONCRETE PROPOSALS WOULD REALLY HELP US. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE HAVE -- TO INDIVIDUALS AND WANTED TO SPEAK ON AND PUBLIC COMMENTS AND SO WILL OPEN THAT UP AT THIS TIME COME FORWARD. STAY IN A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FURTHER ONLY HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR MIDDLE DEFENSE FUND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR FOR HOSTING THIS INFORMATIONAL SESSION -- NOT ONLY THE VERY IN THE TIMELY GIVEN THAT THERE ARE -- DRAFT PLANS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND THAT WILL BE ISSUED BY JANUARY -- TWENTY TWENTY LARGELY YOU KNOW THE THE THE WORK DONE BY THE PPA C. HAS REALLY BAILEY AT AN ISSUE THAT IS -- YOU KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS ABOUT AS IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS AND HANS IT'S GOING TO DRIVE -- REALLY BIG CHANGES IN THE AG SECTOR ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES THE SENTENCING WALKING BALLY -- YOU KNOW THE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THERE CAN BE SOME REALLY GOOD MECHANISMS AND INNOVATIVE PROPOSALS BEING DRAFTED IN THOSE PLANS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- THE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF UP THE MAILING OF FORCING -- FORCING IT TO BE FOLLOWED. IT IS A REALLY BIG CHANGE ALL TOGETHER AND AND REALLY WE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND DOES BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT -- BY MISS NECK IN THE PRESENTATION -- ON SOME OF THE THE STRATEGIES -- TO TO BE ABLE TO EASE THE TRANSITION INTO FULL SEGMENTATION -- TO THAT END -- EDF BELIEVES THAT -- PROVIDING INCENTIVES SO FUNDING FOR FOR LOCAL MATCH DOLLARS -- SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THESE AREAS WHERE THESE AND SOME PROGRAMS CAN BE PILOTED -- IS IS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE TO PLAY AND AND AS A RESULT -- ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S BEEN WORKING ON ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES FOR FIRM YOU KNOW DECADES AT THIS POINT -- WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGE WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN SOME SOME CONCRETE IDEAS AND PROPOSALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'D LIKE TO HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IT'S GOT REAL SCIENTISTS AND CERTAINLY -- WE'D BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM HIM THANK YOU EXPECT. HI IRA -- HI I'M JIM HOLLY WITH LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE SUBSTANTIAL CAPABILITIES OF CALIFORNIA'S. NATIONAL LABORATORIES AS A RESOURCE TO THE COMMITTEE AS YOU THINK ABOUT -- THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- WE DO SIGNIFICANT WORK AND HAVE CAPABILITIES ON ISSUES SUCH AS DESALINIZATION AND THE TREATMENT OF CONTAMINANTS SUCH AS ARSENIC -- HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM AT CETERA ALSO DO A LOT OF WORK ON GROUNDWATER RECHARGE SO -- IT'S NOT JUST LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY BUT OF OUR SISTER ORGANIZATION LAWRENCE LIVERMORE IS ALSO VERY INVOLVED TRY TO HELP. OTHER IS A FEDERAL COMPETITION RIGHT NOW FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN RESEARCH FUNDING FOR WATER TREATMENT WITH A FOCUS ON DISSEMINATION ELLEN MENTIONED THE HIGH COST OF THIS ALLEGATION. SO BOTH LABORATORIES ARE ENGAGED IN LEADING TEAMS TO TRY TO BRING. US SOME OF THAT MONEY TO CALIFORNIA I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR ENGAGE IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AT YOUR CONVENIENCE THANK YOU. WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND SPENDING THE TIME TO PREPARE YOUR TESTIMONY. NOT REALLY APPRECIATE IT REALLY WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO CONCRETE. PROPOSALS AND THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK. THE WEATHER TURNED. WE CAN BE HELPFUL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YES [inaudible] OKAY. DON'T SOMETHING. SHOULD BE USED YEAH. YEAH YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. THIS IS ALL ONLINE. WELL ONE OF THE ONLY YEAH [inaudible] I WAS [inaudible] YOU KNOW [inaudible] YEAH. ONE OF THE VERY MUCH AND WE WILL DO ALL THAT STUFF
