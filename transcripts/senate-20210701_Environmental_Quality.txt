AB. FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT. AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READING. THANK YOU MISTER LET ME JUST- THE FIRST THANK YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS WERE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE CLARIFYING COMMITMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS BY IT BEFORE SEVENTY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A TIME FRAME FOR THERMOFORM FOOD PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS TO USE. MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT IN THE PLASTIC CONTAINER STARTING WITH TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE REFORM FOOD CONTAINERS WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY THERE THE CLAM SHELLS THAT WHOLE STRAWBERRIES FOR LEAFY GREENS OR TAKE OUT CONTAINERS. APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IF THE REFORM WASTE IS DISCARDED EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA AND WHILE MANY OF US MAY THINK THEY'RE RECYCLABLE THEY ACTUALLY ARE NOT RECYCLED BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF THE MARKETPLACE THIS BUILDS UPON THE BILL THAT MYSELF WITH THE MEMBER IRWIN DID LAST YEAR AB SEVEN NINETY THREE TO SET. MINIMUM CYCLE CONTENT FOR PLASTIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES SO BY USING THAT SAME MODEL WE HOPE TO REALLY CHANGE THE DEMAND FOR THESE THERMOFORMED PRODUCTS ACROSS OUR VERY STATE. WITHOUT A WHICH IN TURN OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS FROM THE. NUMBER ONE AND THEN WE HAVE TO WITNESSES. THANK YOU MISTER AND TO MY JOY AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO AB FOR A FOUR SEVEN EIGHT IS A BIG STEP FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CREATING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IT PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO PULL OUT A HIGHLY RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FROM THE WASTE STREAM. AND THROUGH THE MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENT TO CREATE A MARKET FOR THAT MATERIAL. FURTHER THE BILL INCREASES THE SUPPLY OF RECYCLED P. E. T. WHICH IS SEEING AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FROM SEVERAL. INDUSTRIES WHILE THERE REMAIN A FEW OUTSTANDING ITEMS TO ADDRESS WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH THAT I WILL PASS IT BACK. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO. MR GIVEN THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE TWO- AUTHORS HERE TO. WORK ON THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND- AND ADDRESS THIS OF RECYCLE PROBLEMS I WOULD MOVE THE MATTER AS AMENDED. AND THANK YOU. OKAY SO LET'S NOW GO TO LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WE'VE GOT BOB DEBITED FROM OUR PLANET EARTH ON THE CO HOST PHONE LINE WE ALSO HAVE SCOTT WILKERSON FROM BONDUELLE FRESH AMERICAS- SO LET'S TURN TO THOSE TWO WITNESSES FIRST. OKAY THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- THIS IS BOB W. COME THE CO FOUNDER AND CO CEO OF THE COMPANY ARE PLANET EARTH. I DON'T THE BANK CHAIR ALAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PAINTING IN THIS- COMMITTEE HEARING. ARE WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. THANKS TO A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL OUR PLANET EARTH IS THE WORLD'S FIRST MANUFACTURE OF RECYCLED P. E. T. ALSO KNOWN AS HARP AT. PACKAGING OTHER PRODUCTS ARE DERIVED FROM POST CONSUMER BAIL PET CONTAINERS BOTH BOTTLES AND THERMAL FORMS THAT WE RECYCLE IN A QUAKE FORM AND CONVERTING THE NEW BEVERAGE AND FOOD CONTAINERS ARE COMPLETELY PERFECTLY INTEGRATED FACILITY LOCATED IN BURNING CALIFORNIA. WE EMPLOYED TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE AND AS WE GROW WE CONTINUE TO ADD ADDITIONAL. STAFF HERE IN BERLIN. SINCE THE ENTIRE MAY. PROCESS OCCURS IN SINK ROOF THE GREENHOUSE GAS YOU. ASSOCIATE WITH OUR- ARE AMONG THE IN THE- AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL COVER MOST FORM CONTAINERS USED FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGES. INCLUDING ITEMS SUCH AS PRODUCE EMBURY CLAM SHELLS IN CONTAINERS SANDWICH CONTAINERS YOUR CUPS COFFEE PODS FROM TAKEOUT CONTAINERS AND DRINKING CUPS. IT WILL CREATE MARKET DEMAND FOR A MATERIAL THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS BEING LANDFILLS TODAY AND IT IS A CLOSED LOOP SOLUTION. THERE ARE APPROX THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION POUNDS OF POST CONSUMER THERMOFORMING DISCARDED IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR AND GROWING- IF SOMEONE CHANGES CORRECT TWO HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF THAT SYSTEM PDT CONTAINERS. FOR FURTHER HAS PIONEERED THE- TO MAKE THEM A FORM TO THERMAL FORM IN CALIFORNIA THEREBY CLOSING THE LOOP ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PET THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS THAT ARE DISCARDED. IN THE STATE EVERY YEAR. HOWEVER TOO MUCH OF THIS VALUABLE MATERIAL IS STILL CENTRAL. AT THE PRESENT TIME ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WITH A LACK OF COLLECTION THIS MATERIAL TO BE AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING. AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL CREATE MARKET DEMAND AND INCREASED COLLECTION OF POST CONSUMER DEMAND FOR CONTAINERS. WHICH WILL DIVERT THEM FROM LANDFILLS. AND WHAT THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE DEMO FORMS FROM THE COMMINGLED RATE. IT WILL ALSO CAN. ISSUES ABOUT SIERRA BALES AND ENCOURAGE THERMAL FORMS TO BE SEPARATELY BELT. WE HAVE SEEN POSITIONS TAKEN BY SOME THAT WE BELIEVE ARE AT ODDS WITH THE INTENT OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE PROPOSAL TO HAVE DIFFERENT MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS BY RESIN TYPE. BURKE SCREWED OTHERS OUT RIGHT MAY CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE DOING SO MAY ENCOURAGE BRANDS AND RETAILERS TO SWITCH TO RUGBY TYPES WITH THE LOWEST MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS. THEREBY DIMINISHING THE IMPACT OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME A FORM SENT TO LANDFILL AND PORTING THE GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION. WATER CONTENT LEVELS ARE LOWER THAN THAT OF AB SEVEN NINETY THREE THE MAJORITY OF NEW CLAM SHELLS ARE EXPORTED OUT OF STATE. IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR COLLECTION EVEN THOUGH WE EXPECT THE MAJORITY OF EXPORTED BERMAN FORMS ALSO CONTAIN POST CONSUMER TELEPHONE CONTACT. THIS IS DUE TO THE WAY THE CLAM SHELLS ARE PURCHASED AND BERRIES AND VOTERS ARE PACKED IN THE FIELD. THE BILL WINCH THE MAN AMOUNT OF CONSUMER BERMAN. I CLASS. TO RECYCLE RATE OF THAT SAME THAN TRY IN ORDER TO DRIVE MARKETS. AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT WILL INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR STATE POST CONSUMER PLASTIC RESINS. BUDGETS PJ AND POLY. THEY'RE BY ENCOURAGING RECYCLERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE FDA'S ALLEN- DESIGNATION TO OBTAIN IT. BECAUSE THE DEMAND WILL EXISTS TO JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND RECYCLE. THE VARIOUS RESIN TYPES. WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR CARRYING THE BILL AND FOR THE COMMITTEE TIENEN. BY AFTER YEARS OF ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MORNING. THANK YOU. I'M MISDIRECTED COCA A QUITE A BIT OF THE PRO SIDE TESTIMONY SO MISTER WILKERSON IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR COMMENTS- SHORT I'D APPRECIATE THAT. ABSOLUTELY GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU CHAIR ALAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I MEAN IT'S GOT 1% AND THE CHIEF PROCUREMENT OFFICER AT BONDUELLE FRESH AMERICAS. YOU KNOW IT'S IS READY PAC FOODS AND OUR BISTRO GRANTS. PROBABLY BASED IN IRWINDALE AND CHILENOS AND WE'RE ONE OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS IN FRESH VEGETABLES SALADS AND FRESH MAIL SOLUTIONS. HERE WE ARE PLEASED TO JOIN WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND SUPPORTING EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SET THE PACE FOR THE REST OF THE NATION AND THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER AND EXPORTER. AND THERMOFORM PACKAGING SUCH AS CLAM SHELLS HAS ALSO REVOLUTIONIZED. UTILITY FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO TRANSPORT THEIR FRESH PRODUCE TO CONSUMERS NATIONWIDE. WELL DIRECT THE AND PACKAGING MADE WITH POST CONSUMER RECYCLED CONTENT ARE INCREASINGLY A GLOBAL PRIORITY FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER BRANDED RETAILERS. FOR EXAMPLE OUR COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AB TO BE RECYCLABLE OR REUSABLE. PREVIOUSLY MOST OF THAT RECYCLE MATERIALS FROM PLASTIC BOTTLES WHICH INCREASINGLY IN HIGH DEMAND. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINE THREE WHICH SETS MINIMUM CONTENT I'M PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. WE ARE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE WHERE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT CURRENTLY COLLECTING THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS UNLOCKED TO SUPPORT ADEQUATE SUPPLY WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FOUR SEVEN EIGHT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP ENCOURAGE THE COLLECTION OF THIS RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AND ENABLE US. TO MEET OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THROUGH THE RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE THE BILL ALSO IS NEEDED TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND RECYCLABLE PRODUCT BUT ALSO HAS RECYCLED CONTENT AND THIS BILL WILL PROPEL THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN TOWARD MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PACKAGING. IN SOME WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU OKAY LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES. OUTSIDE TO SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL.

ONE SUPPORT AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU MATTER LET'S NOW TURN TO OPPOSITION WE'VE GOT DEL DEL HAD FROM THE WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION ALSO TIM CHESTER. FROM THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL WE CAN HEAR FROM THEM. THANK YOU SENATE ALLEN CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES I CAN HEAR YOU FINE YEP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I THINK THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND WE'RE CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE CONTAINERS THAT YOU BELIEVE SOME AMENDMENTS ARE NECESSARY AROUND. A TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF RECYCLED RESIN AND PROVIDE MANUFACTURED SOME ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE FLEXIBILITY. WE ALSO HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE SCOPE OF IMPACT PACKAGING THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND OF FOOD CONTAINERS BUT THE CURRENT DEFINITION IN THE BILL OF THERMOFORM PLASTIC CONTAINERS PRETTY BROADENED WHAT IMPACT RIDE IF INDUSTRY WILL BE ON FOOD SO SOME CLARIFICATION- WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY THERE. WELL WE GOT A FEW TO BUILD CONCERN THE BILL PROPOSE A VERY AMBITIOUS. I RECYCLE LEVEL THAN RECYCLING RATE. GIVEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS- RECLAMATION. AND YOU AT FTA REQUIREMENTS FOR USING RECYCLED RESIDENTS WHO PACKAGING. THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY YOUR RESIDENT. UNLIKELY SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE MANDATE LEVEL. SO DID OF THE CONCERNS WE WILL DO OUR CONSIDERING OF THE AMENDMENT- ONE OF WITH ALLOW FOR THE USE OF MATERIAL OR NON FORM SOURCES THE NEW COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. I WOULD TO SEE A MARKET OF THE PPR LEVEL TO BE MORE TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE I 10% BY TWENTY TWENTY BY 20% BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND 30% BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND ALSO CONSIDER RECYCLE- BEING AUTHORIZED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGES AFTER TWENTY THIRTY BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE DATE RECLAMATION CAPACITY AND MARKET CONDITIONS. WE DO APPRECIATE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A REDUCTION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY. SHOULD ANY FACTOR NOT BEING COMPLIANT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS BY WHICH MANY FACTORS THAT THE KITCHEN POWER CYCLE ONE INVESTMENT IN BOTH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY LEVEL AND WE ARE. PERCENTAGES THAT PROCESS COULD. INCLUDE SOME CLEAR GUIDELINES AND- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL PROVIDERS YOU ARE. IN ADDITION TO THE YOU THANK YOU SUBMIT. OUR RECYCLE BIN AT THAT. LOCATION FILE GETS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY FOR- WE DO APPRECIATE THAT FOR I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S- PURPOSE BUT YOU BELIEVE CAL RECYCLE THE FIRST UNDERTAKEN. MORE CLEARLY UNDER THE- THAT THAT MAYBE NAY TO IMPROVE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING IN. FOR THE- APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY AND THE FORTY WORKING BUT- ASSEMBLY WORKING- ANOTHER. TO CRAPPIE WERE AND PEACEABLE A BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU TIM APPRECIATE THAT I'M THANK YOU FROM THE- FROM THE WESTERN GROWTH ASSOCIATION. IT MORE MEMBERS. AS YOU KNOW OUR LOW AND REGIONAL FAMILY FOR GROW FRESH. IN ARIZONA CALIFORNIA COLORADO AND NEW MEXICO. OUR MEMBERS AND THEIR WORKERS PROVIDE OVER HALF THE NATION'S FRESH FRUITS VEGETABLES AND TREE NUTS INCLUDING NEARLY HALF OF AMERICANS FRESH ORGANIC PRODUCE. PACKAGING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH SAFE AND HEALTHY FOOD. AND REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY EXTENDING ITS SHELF LIFE TO AVOID FOOD WASTE. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE FOOD PACKAGING AND HAVE STUDIED HOW TO TRANSITION FROM USING THE RPG BOTTLES TO RECYCLE PT CLAMSHELL FOR THEIR SOURCE OF RECYCLED CONTENT. WESTERN GROWERS MEMBERS ARE VERY SUPPORTED OF RECYCLING OUR PLASTIC CONTAINERS. HOWEVER WE SEE SOME ISSUES IN THIS BILL THAT WE'D LIKE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. FIRST THE PT FOR MCCORMACK CONTAINERS. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RECYCLABLE AND SHOULD BE MENTIONED IN THE BILL AND FURTHER CONSUMERS NEED TO HAVE AND KNOW THAT THE CLAM SHELL CAN GO INTO THE RECYCLE BINS TO BE COLLECTED CURBSIDE. AND SECOND THE BILL IS NOT REALLY CLEAR ON WHO ACTUALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIOUS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. AND MAY PUSH FARMERS IN THE POSITION OF FACING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FIRST PORTAIL YEAR OF THE RECYCLING MARKET PLACE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. ENTER THE LANGUAGE PROVIDES AN EXTREMELY NARROW EXEMPTION IF THE CROP IS PACKAGED IN THE FIELD AFTER HARVESTING BUT DID NOT PROVIDE ANY RELIEF FROM THE GROWER WHO HARVEST THEIR FRESH PRODUCE IN THE FIELD. AND TAKE THE TO THE PACKING HOUSE TO BE COOLED AND PACKAGED. IS ROUGHLY NO OFF RAMP. IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT PRODUCTION OR AVAILABILITY OF RECYCLED P. E. T. RAW MATERIALS TO MEET THE RECYCLE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS. OKAY THANK YOU- I'M SURE WILL HAVE A CHANCE DURING DISCUSSION AND TO TALK ABOUT ALL THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WELL LET'S TURN TO THE PHONE LINES TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO REGISTER THEIR OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. AB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU TO REGISTER OPPOSITION TO AB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AGAIN THAT PROMPT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE. TO HAVE A TWO LINES IN Q. HERE WE JUST A MOMENT PLEASE. WE'LL GO FIRST TO THE LINE OF TWENTY NINE TO NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU SIR AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD AYE YOU ARE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR PACKAGING IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ASSOCIATION ALSO AND- POSE THE MOST IMMINENT POSITION. ON THE OTHER LINE. FIFTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CODY BOILED ME HALF THE CALIFORNIA FRESH FRUIT ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION WITH OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. THANK MISTER JOURNAL FOR THE LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OKAY LET'S BRING THE ITEM BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. I'M MAYBE WHAT WE DO WE CAN GIVE THE AUTHORS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ON THE- LEGALLY TESTED WEEKLY TESTIMONY YEP. THAT WE DEFINITELY ARE LOOKING AT TAKING AMENDMENTS TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO FURTHER DEFINE SPECIFICALLY WHICH TERM OF FORMS PART TALKING ABOUT WE APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK. AND WE ALSO WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION REALLY AROUND. RECYCLING LANGUAGES WHILE RECYCLING EDUCATION NO THAT'S ONE OF THEIR- ISSUES TO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT AT THE BACK FROM THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. IT IS. YES BECAUSE THIS. SO IT'S BEEN DOUBLE OR FOR A GREAT. RIGHT I'M- OKAY SURE I GUESS I GUESS IF I'M READING INTO WHAT THE- OPPOSITION SAYING WE'RE MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN POST CONSUMER RECYCLED. NON THERMAL FIVE PLASTIC AND POST CONSUMER PLASTIC IS PHILIP WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THESE INDUSTRIES WOULD RECYCLE MATERIALS WERE TO WERE SEGREGATING THAT THE- THERMAL FORM. FORM OF PLASTIC CONTAINERS VERSUS THE OTHER TYPES OF PLASTICS FROM OVERNIGHT OVER SIMPLIFYING DATA THAT YOU'VE BEEN VISION WHAT THERE WILL BE A WHOLE CLOSED LOOP WHICH IS THE THERMAL FORM PLASTICS. N. I THINK THE OBJECT THE OBJECTION IS THAT IF THE MARKET DOESN'T. BUILD UP IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS CAN WE SUBSTITUTE WITH RECYCLED MATERIAL BUT NOT ON THE- THERMAL FORM. IS AT AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF WHAT. WHERE WE'RE AT. AN ACCOMPLICE HATED PROCESS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE TRYING TO DRIVE DEMAND BY HAVING AND MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENT AND IT AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH THE- WITH THE BILL FOR SEVENTY EIGHT BY I MEAN AND THE CLASSICS BILL FROM LAST YEAR BUT THE NINETY THREE. NINETY THREE BY THE FAR YOU'RE REALLY DRIVING YOUR DRIVING DEMAND PREFERRED IF I RECALL THE- THE BOTTLE BUILD BUG FAXES PLASTIC WE REQUIRED A MINIMUM CONTENT BUT WE DIDN'T SAY IT COULD NOT BE. THERMAL FORM PLASTIC- SORT OF- WHAT TO YOU PICK WITH US ANY SEE ANY ANY APPROPRIATE PLASTIC THAT WAS RECYCLED SO IT'S THEM I MEAN I LOOK FORWARD I'M GOING TO SUPPORTING THE MEASURE BUT IT'S AS THE MARKET'S MATURE AND YOU HAVE THIS SEGREGATION- OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC OBVIOUSLY THE ONE HAVE DIFFERENT TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOU SO- LOOK FOR TO CONTENTION TO IT AND FOR THAT FOR THE BOTTLES YOU DO NEED TO USE THAT THAT SPECIFIC TYPE OF PLASTIC AND THAT'S HOW YOU CREATE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR THE THERMA FORMS. YOU CAN ALSO USE THE BOOK THEY THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE BOTTLES BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD MAKE THEM MARKET FOR BOTTLES MORE DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY WITH- THE JUST THE THERMAL FORMS BUT ALSO SINCE WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF RECYCLING POTOM TO LEAVE THAT THAT'S NOT TODAY'S. DISCUSSIONS WILL HAVE THAT LATER. ALL RIGHT. YES SENATE SKINNER. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR BRING THE BILL- YOU KNOW THERE'S A- I THINK MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO KNOW. THAT JUST PUTTING SOMETHING IN A RECYCLING BIN IS NOT RECYCLING. AND THAT UNLESS THE PRODUCT. IS RE MANUFACTURED. MEANING UNLESS THE PRODUCT IS TAKEN AND THEN HOWEVER TRANSFORM TO BE RE MANUFACTURED INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT THERE IS NO RECYCLING. AND SO. THIS WILL HELP US ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND PLASTICS OF COURSE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OF THEIR UBIQUITOUS NOW THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE- WE'VE NOT HAD ADEQUATE RULES. ON WHAT THE CONTENT OF THE PLASTIC IS THE CAN MADE UP OF SO MANY DIFFERENT POLYMERS THAT IT'S OFTEN TIMES IN MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO THEN TAKE THAT MATERIAL AND- YOU SAID IN ANOTHER MATERIAL- AND OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW. THAT A LITTLE SYMBOL ON THE PARTICULAR PACKAGE DOES NOT ALSO INDICATE THAT IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW MAYBE THEORETICALLY IT MIGHT BE RECYCLABLE BUT IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL. RE USE OF THAT MATERIAL SO I THINK THIS WILL HELP US GET THERE I. ACTUALLY I THINK THAT- IF WE TAKE THE THREE OURS REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE YOU NOTICE THAT RECYCLE IS THE THIRD OF THE THREE R'S THAT REDUCTION IS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST GOAL. BUT IN THE MEANTIME. THIS IS A GOOD STEP THERE. OKAY ARE THE ITEMS REMOVED BY CENTER WITH CASKEY- IF THE OTHERS LIKE TO CLOSE- WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT- SECOND STEP WITH ARGUMENT OF COMPLEMENT THE BEVERAGE BOTTLE BILL THAT WE DID. WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE BILL AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WITH FORMER FORMS WHICH ARE LIKE CENTER SKINNER SAID- ACTUALLY YOU PICK WHAT IS AT THIS POINT. ADJUSTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER IPHONE. OKAY THANK YOU I'M COMPLETELY. I AM NUMBER ONE EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STING AND IRWIN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY HI. ALLEN HI. BATES DOLLY GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE STERN WHITE HOUSE SKI. OKAY SO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF IN THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A ROLL TOGETHER FOLKS TO ADD ON. R. S. C. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN HERE SHE CAN PRESENT ITEM NUMBER THREE IN YOUR AGENDAS MEMBERS THIS IS- AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN. YOU MAY PERCEIVE AND READY. THERE ARE A MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL MISTER CHAIR FOR YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEES HELP WITH THIS BILL WE RAN OUT OF TIME TO GET MANY OF THE- AMENDMENTS- INTO PRINT- BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE AND ALSO THE OFFICE OF SENATOR LINCOLN'S ALWAYS FROM TRANSPORTATION WITH THIS BILL IS GOING NEXT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS AND SENATE TRANSPORTATION. AB FORTY SEVEN- IS TRYING TO TAKE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO HELPING THE STATE IN OUR NGOS IN OUR LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AS YOU ALL KNOW DARRELL STEINBERG- IN HIS SEMINAL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LEGISLATION S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. THE OF THE ASKED COMMUNITIES TO PLAN FOR REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BUT UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE YEARS. DESPITE THE EXTREMELY WELL INTENTIONED GOALS OF THAT BILL WE'VE SEEN BY A CAR WHILE TROUBLED INCREASING CALIFORNIA WE'VE GONE THE WRONG DIRECTION. THIS BILL MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES IN OUR PROCESSES AND OUR GOAL SETTING. AND ALSO. TO TRY TO HELP WITH THAT. AND ALSO- PROPOSES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING. TO HELP OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOT JUST PLAN BUT ALSO TO CONSTRUCT. PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IT ALLOWS FOR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO TAKE VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES- TO CHANGE LAND USE TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S- NEST NECESSITY TO DRIVE. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES A LOT OF INCENTIVES WITH THE- OF USE OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT- PROGRAM. TO HELP COMMUNITIES WITH PLANNING AND WITH CONSTRUCTION- THAT WITH THAT WE HAVE TODAY IT WILL BE AIRED FROM THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND JULIA RANDOLPH FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AND I THINK THEY'RE AVAILABLE BY FRANKIE BROWN. YEP THANK YOU THIS IS WILL BEAR AT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION THANK YOU CAROLYN MEMBERS AND ENSURE ON YOUR ONGOING INTEREST IN THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AS WELL. ESTACION SECTOR IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF CALIFORNIANS HARMFUL ERIN CLIMATE POLLUTION WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO HEALTHIER MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVES ALL RESIDENTS. CALIFORNIA WILL SIMPLY NOT MEET OUR HELP PROTECT OF CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE STANDARDS. LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING IS CENTRAL TO THE DISCUSSION CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO ACHIEVING THE CLIMATE HEALTH EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS ENVISIONED BY SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY FIVE. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE THE BENEFITS OF HEALTH YOUR COMMUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY FOR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE AIR POLLUTION BURDENS ARE OFTEN MORE EXTREME. THAN ACROSS THE STATE. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WITH SUPPORT GETTING CALIFORNIA ON TRACK BY BRINGING LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE AGENCIES TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING REGIONAL CLIMATE GOALS WITHIN THEIR OWN LOCAL CONTACTS- INCLUDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MPO TO CONSULT WITH LOCAL AGENCIES ON CHALLENGES PREVENTING THE ACHIEVEMENT ORIGINAL TARGETS. AND ESTABLISHES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MPO TO DEVELOP A TARGET ACTION PLAN THAT WOULD HELP TO IDENTIFY ANY KEY BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATION OR ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS. OUTRAGE TO AND REPORTS REALLY IMPORTANTLY OF INPUT FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THEN CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR AN MPO TO MEET ITS TWENTY THIRTY FIVE REGIONAL TARGET. UPON THE COMPLETION OF THAT MPO- TARGET ACTION PLAN IF YOU LIVE IN FORTY SEVEN WOULD MAKE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ACTIONSNEEDED TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND TO MEET REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS THAT BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES. IF YOU'RE SEEKING TO ACCELERATE ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE THEIR HEALTHCARE COMMUNITIES BUT BY CURRENT FUNDING CAN REALLY SERVE AS A MAJOR PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HELP TO CORRECT THE COURSE. THAT WE'VE HAD SO FAR NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN IN ACHIEVING SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE VISION. THAT WE ARE HERE AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. DID YOU MISTER BARRETT LET'S SAY MEXICO TO JULIE RANDALL FROM THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS THIS IS JULIE ARAMBULA I AM A PART OF THE ENTIRE REGION THAT YET FOR THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. IN POLYESTER BURIED COMMON PLEAS COURT AB ELAM FORTY SEVEN AS IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY- CREATED THE STATE EFFORT TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION CHOICES THAT REDUCE HARMFUL AIR AND CLIMATE POLLUTION. LOGICAL MILES TRAVELED CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION IN APPLYING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLE ENGINE AND PROMPTING INNOVATION IN TRANSPORTATION YOUR- BUT WE HAVE STRUGGLING TO ALIGN LAND USE WITH THE NEED TO REDUCE THE ENERGY AND THE CORRESPONDING EMISSION THAT CAUSE. AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE THE PASSING OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY DIVERTING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT REACH HELP- PAIRED AND CHEF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE IT'S NOT YIELDING IT ENDED CLIMATE HEALTH EQUITY IN CONSERVATION RESULT. WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BEING THE LEADING SOURCE OF BEARING CLIMATE POLLUTION REDUCTION B. AND G. P. AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN TAKE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH THAT CALIFORNIA ON THE COURSE TO BE ITS GHG EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS EXPECTED UNDER AT. THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY MAKING CHANGES THAT THE STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL RIGHT TOOL ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES. FOR NPL CAN MEET THEIR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN REGIONAL GHG EMISSION TARGET. THE BELLOWING REQUIRE EACH AND P. L. DEGREE AT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TARGET ACTION PLAN DEVELOPING NEW BLACK GRANT PROGRAMS TO HELP. ACHIEVE THEIR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS AND REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO TAKE ACTION BACK THERE AND BE- GLOBAL STRATEGY. FONG I WOULD INCLUDED IT IN CIGNA ATTENTION TO ISSUE WITH THAT WITHIN THE MOBILE STRIVE AND THE OF MEETING POLITICAL AIR CLIMATE STANDARD. AFTER TRANSPORTATION LAST BY A BY ROLE IN. AFTER TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION GIGI THE EMPLOYEE. WALKING AND BICYCLING ALSO HAD MANY POSITIVE. THANK YOU THE PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL CON AND THE DATA AND AT. ABOUT AB ONE FOR SEVEN ONE IS THAT IN THE DEVELOPED OF TRANSFORM AFTER. PART OTHER CITY THE COUNTRIES BEEN BREAK SUCH AS- BICYCLE HIGHWAYS AND FIFTEEN COMMUTE. THANKS THE CAR WE WERE A VEHICLE FORTY. AT THE WEIGHT IMPROVE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND LITTLE. CAL COMMUNITY WE URGE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THAT BELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY AND WORK FORCE THAT BUILDS REPAIRS AND MAINTAINS CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE. MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION I'D LIKE TO START MY TESTIMONY BY- HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT AS I SPEAK I AM HOPING TO FINALIZE SOME AMENDMENTS- AND SEND THEM TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN STAFF FOR HER. CONSIDERATION THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION- BUT IN SHORT- OUR CONCERNS ARE AROUND AT THE JUNE TENTH LANGUAGE- RELATED TO HAVE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA IN THE INDUSTRY ARE. VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE STATE'S CULTURE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CURRENT- FRAMEWORK CREATED BY SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH DIRECTORS MPO TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS MANY OF THE GHG REDUCING STRATEGIES THAT NPOS EMPLOYEE ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF CONTRIBUTING TO A REDUCTION OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AT BUT AT THE SAME TIME- THE M. T. REDUCING POLICIES WE BELIEVE OUR TOOL AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AT B. M. T. GOLD BEING ELEVATED AS THE GOAL ITSELF AND NOT THE TOOL BY WHICH TO MEET OUR GHG AND CLIMATE GOALS. IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW THE M. T. REDUCTION STRATEGIES INTERACT WITH OTHER IMPORTANT STATE GOALS- NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH- FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS IMPACTS ON- LIVING WAGE. JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS THAT OUR OUR CONCERNS- WITH THE BILL BUT APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TIME AND HER STAFF TIME WORKING WITH US AND HOPE TO FIND SOME RESOLUTION BEFORE ITS NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING NEXT.

I AGREE WITH THEM REALLY THE WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE GOAL OF REDUCING CLIMATE EMISSIONS. AND SOME OF WE USE THAT TERM AND INTERCHANGEABLY WITH B. M. T. BUT NOT ALL THE M. T. IS THE SAME. RIGHT AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT GOAL SETTING. AND WITH THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HELP THAT YOU'VE ALL YOU'VE ALL YOU'VE BOTH GIVEN ME AND THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GREAT DOES A MOVE A SECOND. CONSULT PLEASE COLOR.

SAYS ABOUT TO GET OUT BUT- WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THIS TO ADELINE I SEE A SUMMER CAREER HERE SHE CAN APPROACH THE DIETS I JUST WANNA BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TELEVISED ON IT MAY NOT BE QUITE EASILY ACCESSIBLE I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REPEAT THE PARTICIPANT NUMBER FOR FOLKS WHO LIKE TO PREVENT PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT NUMBER IS. SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE THREE AN ACCESS CODE IS. SEVEN ZERO FIVE SIX NINE OH NINE. SEVEN ZERO FIVE SIX NINE OH NINE SO ONCE AGAIN JUST REMEMBER EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE THREE ACCESS CODE SEVEN ZERO FIVE. SIX NINE ZERO NINE AND SO WE HAVE A CAREER HE MAY BRIDGE THE DICE WHEN READY AT PRESENT. YOUR BILL WHICH IS AB. TWELVE SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MMBERS I'M SO PROUD TO PRESENT A SYMBOL AT TWELVE SEVENTY SIX A MEASURE THAT WILL BUILD ON CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING EFFORTS TO COMBAT SINGLE USE PLASTIC AN ITEM WASTE. WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND REDUCES. UNNECESSARY COSTS FOR BUSINESSES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES AN ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BILLION DISPOSABLE FOOD WHERE ITEMS ARE USED. RESULTING IN A MASSIVE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION TONS OF WASTE. UNUSED FOOD ACCESSORIES INCLUDING UTENSILS STRAWS NAPKINS AND CONDIMENT PACKAGES. CLOG OUR LANDFILLS COMPLICATE RECYCLING AND POLLUTES STREETS AND WATERWAYS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE HAVE IT A WITNESS. THE PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED THE RELIANCE ON TAKE OUT AND FOOD DELIVERY WHICH RESTAURANTS HAVE RELIED UPON. TO STAY AFLOAT AS SUCH THE USE OF SINGLE FOOD ACCESSORIES HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. INCREASE THE SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND A 30% INCREASE IN WASTE. TODAY MANY FOOD FACILITIES AND FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE PROVIDE SINGLE USE FOOD AND BEVERAGE ACCESSORIES ACCESSORIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE NEEDED. MOST CONSUMERS DO NOT WANT THEM OR HAVE ALREADY HAVE REUSABLE ITEMS AT HOME OR IN THEIR WORKPLACE. IN THE END THESE ACCESSORIES ARE USUALLY DISCARDED WITHOUT EVEN BEING USED. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX EXPANDS. THE PLASTIC STRAW BY REQUEST LAW TO INCLUDE OTHER SINGLE USE WITH ACCESSORIES. MORE FOOD FACILITIES AND THIRD PARTY DELIVERY PLATFORMS INCLUDING FOOD THAT IS TAKEN AWAY DELIVERED OR SERVED ON SITE. THIS IS A WASTE REDUCTION MEASURE THAT REDUCES WASTE UPSTREAM BEFORE. IT'S EVEN CREATED EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE SOURCE REDUCTION OF UNNECESSARY SINGLE USE ITEMS IS BY FAR. THE MOST EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROTECT RESOURCES COMMUNITIES AND HELP CALIFORNIA REACH IT'S A RACE AS WASTE REDUCTION AND CLIMATE GOALS. IT SAVES BUSINESSES MONEY AND RELIEVES RECYCLERS COMPOSTERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THE COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. RESTAURANTS IN THE US SPEND ROUGHLY NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS PURCHASING DISPOSABLE FOOD WHERE ITEMS. IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SPEND OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. ANNUALLY AND ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTERING THE STREETS STORM DRAINS PARKS AND WATERWAYS. MANY OF THESE FOOD ACCESSORIES ARE MADE OF PLASTIC AND PLASTIC PRODUCTION ADMITS GREENHOUSE GASES AND HARMS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. NEAR OLD REFINERIES PLASTIC PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND LANDFILLS OR INCINERATORS THE INCREASING SURGE IN THE USE OF MATERIALS EXACERBATES HEALTH RISKS PREDOMINATELY. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENTED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE.

ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH OF THAT YEAR GRUBHUB OFFICIALLY JOINED THE CUTOUT CUTLERY CAMPAIGN AND COMMITTED TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS THAT ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THE COMING MONTHS GRUBHUB APP AND WEBSITE WILL BEGIN AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULT DEFAULTING TO ZERO UTENSILS AND NAPKINS WITH EVERY ORDER. BOB DINERS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO REQUEST PLASTIC WHERE WE NEEDED THIS SMALL CHANGE WILL GENERATE SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABILITY BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITIES DINERS AND RESTAURANTS. THIS ACTION WILL REMOVE MILLIONS OF PIECES OF PLASTIC CUTLERY FROM ENTERING THE ENVIRONMENT ANNUALLY ACCORDING TO HAVE THAT THE VOICE .ORG ORGANIZER TO CUT OUT COLOR CAMPAIGN FORTY BILLION PIECES OF PLASTIC CUTLERY AND UP IN THE WASTE STREAM EACH YEAR. POLLUTING. OUR OCEANS AND LITTERING OUR STREETS. BUT BEYOND THE ENVIRONMENT BENEFITS REMOVE CLASSIC WAY IT'S ANOTHER WAY GROW. AND OUR DINERS CAN CHEN COST. FOR ROSTRON AND- AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. OUR THAT RESTAURANTS CAN POTENTIAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR ANNUALLY BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WHERE THEY DISTRIBUTE. MUNICIPAL BUDGET ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE REDUCTION IN LETTER ON CITY STREETS. USING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC WEIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN GRUBHUB'S JOURNEY TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

WE THINK THAT NAPKIN- PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT THE HYGIENIC AS WELL THEY ARE IMPORTANT- VALUE TO USE- AND WE WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE IS PEOPLE WELL THE FALCONS CALLING OUT THOSE SINGLE WHITE OUT OF THERE FOR WHICH- AS YOUR COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS THAT GOT A LOT OF ISSUES WHICH THAT THE MEN OTHER. WORDS SEEKING CLARIFICATION ON PAGE FIVE OF THE BILL. BUT I'M WORKING ON IT AND YET. THE SECTION. WHERE TO YOU SEVEN ONE D. WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SELF SERVE- DOES THAT YEAH YOUR HOW A NOW IN THE- WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE RIGHT ON ABOUT FOR THE CUSTOM. AND IT SAYS BUT IN IN THE YOU'RE HONOR- CONSUMER REQUEST SO THAT WOULDN'T PROJECT SERVICE OR ENACTING THE FENCE AND COULD BE VERY UNSANITARY YEAH I DON'T WHY THAT HAVE STOPPED AT THE CASH REGISTER FROM OTHER SITTING AT A TABLE WITH HER KIDS REALIZE THIS YOU FORGOTTEN OUT NOW AND NOW ABOUT THE PAPER YEAH OR READ THEM UNATTENDED AND TRY TO GO DOWN THE LINE TO GET ON THAT YEAH. SO WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR SOME. CLARIFICATION ON THAT. NO WE HAVE NO OTHER GROUPS ARE BUT BILL. THANK YOU FOR THE- TO EXPRESS THAT. LET'S HEAR FROM WITNESSES FROM FOLKS WANT TO WEIGH IN IN OPPOSITION TO RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR. THANK YOU YEP NPR IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ALLOW ME A FEW MOMENTS TO THE JOURNAL COMMENTS COMING IN. DID YOU WANNA MAYBE LET US KNOW LEADERS. ANYONE SETTING ON AND IF IT. I JUST. YEAH NO NO PUBLIC COMMENTS COMING AND IN OPPOSITION OKAY ALL RIGHT GREAT ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING THE ITEM BACK TO THE- COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION- MADAM VICE CHAIR. HI JOHN I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE NAPKINS BECAUSE I KNOW THE DRIVE THRU RESTAURANTS OFTEN ASK YOU IF YOU'RE CONSUMING IT IN THE CAR OR YOU'RE TAKING AT HOME SO- EAT IF IDENTIFIED AS SOMEONE EATING IN THE CAR SHOULDN'T THE NOW CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED. IN IT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY I'M NOT SURE WHAT AMENDMENTS YOU ALL ARE DISCUSSING. BECAUSE OF THIS I KNOW ONE RESTAURANT IN PARTICULAR I THINK IT'S IN N. OUT BURGER THAT SHOULD STOP. AUTOMATIC QUESTION NOW AND SHE HAS YOU IN THE LINE. THAT TO IF YOU'RE CONSUMING IN THE CAR THEY IMMEDIATELY PUT BILLS IN HAND TO EUROPE. INTO YOUR BAG AND AYE NAPKINS AS MENTIONED BY THE. OPPOSITION AS PART OF THE SAN BEING. SENATOR AND IN THE CAR SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ASSUME WOMAN COULD RE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT'S THE OPT AND SO YOU ARE IN THE CAR YARD AND OUT WHICH IS A GREAT CALIFORNIA BUSINESS THE- THE DRIVE THRU ATTENDANT IS pCATCH UP DO YOU WANT THE LITTLE YELLOW PEPPERS WHICH I LOVE D. MONSTROSITY WANT NAPKINS ARE YOU EATING IN THE CAR SO THAT'S ALREADY AN OPT IN MODEL IN THE BILL THEY WILL BE RECEIVING THEIR NAPKINS WITH SO. WE JUST WE JUST NEED TO REMIND BE REMINDED THEM THAT LIST OF THINGS THAT MAKE SURE THAT THE- MAP CAN BE FOUND HERE OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY SENATOR WHAT'S GONNA. HI PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL AND- A CHAIR. I BELIEVE THERE'S SOME AMENDMENTS YES SO- SO WE'VE DISCUSSED SO SHE'S ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE THE LANGUAGE AND BOLD ON PAGE NINE PAGES NINE AND TEN. I'M YOU KNOW. WE CLARIFIED INITIALLY RELATING TO SOME OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE BOTTOM OF PAGE EIGHT WHICH AND SHE'S NOT TAKING I WILL SAY- YOU KNOW I KNOW THE CASE A COUPLE IT'S FOR EXAMPLE. IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO HAVE A COUPLE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GO. GET YOUR CAR WITH HOT COFFEE. HOWEVER I WILL SAY THERE A LOT OF SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE FOR SOME REASON STARBUCKS AND OTHERS ARE GIVING OUT DISPOSABLE CUPS FOR FOLKS WHO ARE. TO GET A COPY AT THE SHOP. AND IF YOU'RE LITERALLY JUST GOING AND TO TABLE AT THE SHOP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE COUPLE IS KIND OF SILLY AND WASTEFUL BUT- YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT- IT'S HARD TO WRITE THIS IN A WAY THAT- CAN DIFFERENTIATE IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE MY PREFERENCE FOR THEM THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS FOR- FOR THE FOR THE BILL TO APPLY- BUT- I UNDERSTAND I'M NOT. I'M I'M NOT CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO FORCE THAT ON TO THE AUTHOR. OF THE OTHER ISSUE WE WERE DISCUSSING WAS ISSUE THAT'S MENTIONED ANALYSIS ON PAGE NINE. IN SECTION FIVE. I WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE PENALTY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PENALTY IS. ADEQUATE TO COVER THE ENFORCEMENT. COSTS AND THE OTHER WAS MENTIONING THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE- PERSONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRAW- ORDINANCES AS ARE THE STRONG LAW THAT- THAT- IN DECEMBER CALDERON RAN A FEW YEARS AGO- BUT IT DOES CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN OF MINE THAT- WE ENSURE THAT. THAT- THERE'S REAL THERE'S TEETH HERE HAVE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING SOMETHING FOR THE FOR THE FOR FOLKS TO CONSIDER AS THIS BILL MOVES ALONG. THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE AYE THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY ACCEPTED ARE THE- ONES IN BOLD. ON PAGE NINE TEN. MINUTES AUTHORS ACCEPTED AND I JUST- I'VE COUPLE COMMENTS SO TO MAKE BUT I AM INTERESTED- WAS THE REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER. IN NINETEEN. THE REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER FINE. IT SAYS IN THE ANALYSIS THE BILL REGIONALLY HAD A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER DAY FINE WITH A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF THOUSAND- DID YOU REMOVE THAT YOURSELF OR DID WAS THAT REQUIRED IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY. I REMOVE THAT MYSELF I BELIEVE THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FEES ONE THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE LINE. FINE YES THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FINE IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH LEGISLATION ALREADY PASSED THAT EXPANDS THAT IS PART OF THE EXPANSION OF THIS BILL WHICH IS THE STRAW- LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY FORMER MAJORITY LEADER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON- IN ADDITION TO I ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE PROCESS IN WHICH THESE FINES AND- INSPECTIONS OCCUR TO BE SEAMLESS. SO IF YOU ARE AN INSPECTOR GOING INTO A RESTAURANT AND YOU ARE SEEN THAT STROSS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED- IT SHOULD BE IN ALIGNMENT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STRONG ENOUGH WORK. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE WILL CHARGE A RESTAURANT MORE FOR A FOR A FORK R A KNIFE OR SPOON VERSUS A STRAW I ALSO WANT TO BE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS THAT WE ARE. IN A RECOVERY MODE OF FOLLOWING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND SMALL RESTAURANTS MOM AND POP SHOPS ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO RECOVER. SO LET'S DO THIS THE WAY IT IS NOW LET'S TEST IT LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS AND IF WE NEED TO COME BACK AND SEE THAT THE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE LAW IS NOT BEING FOLLOWED THEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. BUT I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS CLIMATE ORIENTED THAT IS ENVIRONMENT ORIENTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO ONE RECOVER AND TO PUT THIS PRACTICE AND TO PLACE- I SURE SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE- CHAIR. REGARDING IMPACT OF THE PARTICULAR FINE- BUT- APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION AND- WE PRICE SHOULDN'T BETTER ON STRAWS BUT WHATEVER BUT I MEAN THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WHERE WERE OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE HOPING THAT NOT ONLY SMALL BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC. THROUGH LEGISLATION LIKE THIS TAKES THE AWARENESS TO- YOU KNOW NOT ALWAYS USE THE SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS I HAVE TO- I APPRECIATE THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT. WHEN I DID ORDER TO GO EVEN WHEN I EXPLICITLY INDICATED SINCE I WAS GOING TO EAT THE FOOD AT MY HOME THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANY OF THE FIGHT THOSE ITEMS I DIDN'T NEED THE NAPKINS I DIDN'T NEED ANY OF THE CUTLERY I WOULD GET IT ANYWAY. AND OF COURSE RIGHT HERE IN THIS BUILDING EVERY TIME WERE SERVED LUNCH WE ARE GIVEN THESE DISPOSABLE PACKAGES OF DISPOSABLE CUTLERY NOW IRONICALLY WHEN I WAS TALKING TO A NUMBER OF THE FOOD BUSINESSES IN MY AREA IN THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC THEY SET THE SINGLE LARGEST COST TO THEM IN GOING RETURN CLEARLY TO GO FOOD. WAS THOSE PACKETS THOSE CUTLERY PAT PACKETS WHICH OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT PERCENT WERE DEAD NEVER USED RIGHT AND- SO AND OF COURSE THE IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY MEAN WASTEFUL THERE'S NO ONE AT THE GROUND WASTE BUT THERE'S VERY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS AS THE AUTHORS POINT OUT THE NOTICES POINTED OUT. IN TERMS OF OUR WATER OUR WATER WAYS OUR LANDFILLS. OUR I MEAN JUST- I NEED TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL OF THE AMOUNT OF. OF ENERGY THAT IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THESE PRODUCTS AND THEN TO- DISPOSE OF THEM. AND THEN BASICALLY MOST OF THEM OTHER THAN THE PAPER ONES ARE WITH US FOREVER. SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- MOVE. AND- I LIKED IT THE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT AS I DID IN THE EARLIER BILL THAT- THE THREE R'S R. REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE RECYCLE IS THE LAST OF THE THREE R'S REDUCES THE FIRST AND THIS IS MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF REDUCED SO- AGAIN I MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. THANK YOU FOR THE SENS CARE. OKAY BOB YES AND ONLY. I LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON CENTER SKINNER'S COMMENT ON SO LIKE WE DO AS WE GET OUR SALADS HERE TO CAPITOL THEY COME WITH THE- WITH THE- SOULPEPPER. IT'S ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE PLUS THINGS INSIDE THE- SALAD CONTAINERS SO. WHO WHO'S THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN THERE ANYMORE UNLESS WE ASK FOR RIGHT SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CONFUSION BY WHO'S- WHO'S SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT. AND SO IN AND OUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT BUSINESS RIGHT NOW. AS YOU STATED. IS BEEN STRUGGLING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE RULES THERE'S DINING IN DINING OUT THERE'S- CAN WEAR MASKS NOT MEANS LOTS OF CONFUSION AND SPECIALLY IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY. WERE THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION I WOULD SAY SO. I'M NOT SURE OF THE TIMING OF THIS BILL IS A GREAT IDEA I GUESS I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CURB. WE'RE TRYING TO ADD WE'RE TRYING TO. GET THE PUBLIC TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT. IF YOU DON'T NEED IT DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT I GET I UNDER. I TOTALLY GET THAT- SO. WHERE WHERE IS THE WHO'S IT LIABLE THAT POINT. LIKE IF. WE DON'T NEED. TO I HAVE A FORK IN MY OFFICE THAT I USE AND I DON'T NEED TO AND HAVE SALT AND PEPPER AND A NAPKIN. WHO WHO'S WHO'S LIABLE WHAT WHO'S WHO'S AT FAULT. THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION CENTER I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHERE YOU GET YOUR SALAD FROM SO THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TO RESTAURANT SO WHETHER YOU GET YOUR SALAD FROM BALK AT A GROCERY STORE VERY DIFFERENT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO A LOCAL RESTAURANT TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE- YOUR FOOD WHETHER IT'S YOU BINA DIRECTLY OR WHETHER YOU'RE ORDERING IT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY APP WHICH HAS THE OPTIONS TO. GET THE COMMENTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A FORK OR SALT AND PEPPER SO IT JUST DEPENDS THIS IS NOT INCLUDE- GROCERY STORES SO IF THIS IS IF YOU'RE BUYING LIKE A ALREADY PREMADE SALAD OUTSIDE YOUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE THIS IS. NOT THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU ARE GOING INSIDE A RESTAURANT WHETHER YOU ARE TAKING WHETHER YOU GO INSIDE THE RESTAURANT EAT THERE WHETHER YOU ARE GOING INSIDE THE RESTAURANT AND TAKING IT TO GO. OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN A DRIVE THROUGH. OKAY. OKAY ARE LESS THE BILLS A MOVE BY CENTER SKINNER I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE BILL AND IF IT IS ULTIMATELY JUST ABOUT. GIVING CONSUMERS THE OPTION. IF THEY WANT TO USE THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT AND IN SO MANY CASES THEY'RE GIVING THESE PRODUCTS IN A WIN WHEN THEY- WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE NO USE FOR THEM- FIRST FOR THE- FIRST FOR THE FOR CONSUMING THEM. YEAH BOB I'VE GONE MANY TIMES BROUGHT EXACTLY THE EXAM EXPERIENCES OF CENTER SKINNER WHERE I WANT TO SUPPORT A LOCAL BUSINESS. AND GET TAKE OUT THOMAS WAS EVERYWHERE DON'T WANT ALL THE STUFF THAT I DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE I'M GOING TO COME HOME AND EAT IT WITH MY FAMILY HOME I GOT PLENTY OF NICE CALORIES YET THERE THERE IT IS- MY OF A BAG FULL OF PLASTICS- THAT I'M NOT GONNA THAT I'VE KNOWN NO USE FOR. SOME ARE VERY MUCH OF THE PROJECT THE SPAWNING I'M GONNA THROW IN SUPPORT OF TODAY SO TO MOVE BY SENATOR- CONSULT PLEASE COLOR. MAKE MY CLOTHES. HELLO I'M SO SORRY I'M SO SORRY. YES OF COURSE THANK YOU M. LET ME JUST REITERATE- THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING IN THIS BILL THANKS TO THE WORK DONE BY THE COMMITTEE- STAFF AND LET ME READ IT IT SAYS ALL FOOD FACILITIES ARE ENCOURAGED BUT NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTIONS IN ADDITIONS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SECTION THAT SUPPORTS THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE USE. OF AND WASTE GENERATED BY ALL SINGLE USE FOODSERVICE PRODUCTS AND I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE MISTER TERRY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT RECEIVING THE LETTER NOT- ON A COFFEE CUP I REMEMBER I RECALL IN THE NINETIES WHEN COFFEE SHOPS BECAME. REALLY COOL AND EVERYBODY WANTED TO HANG OUT AT A COFFEE SHOP YOU GOT YOUR COFFEE IN A MUG. WE HAVE GONE AWAY FROM THAT AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING THAT YOUR COFFEE CUP IN ANY CONTAINER TO GO I WISH IN OUR CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE IT WAS JUST THE COFFEE SHOP OR WHATEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WASH DISHES. AND THAT'S PART OF THE SITUATION INSTANCE NOT EVERYONE DOES AND pCONVERSATION AS TO WHO AND WHERE AND HOW AND SO I JUST I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE FOR THOSE THAT ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO WASH. REUSABLE CUPS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO AND I HOPE THEY ARE ENCOURAGED TO DO SO VERSES PERHAPS A SMALL COFFEE SHOP THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO USE REUSABLE CUPS SO AGAIN JUST A- I THINK A POINT OF CLARIFICATION AS TO WHERE WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. WHERE WE CAN GO IN THE FUTURE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR AMENDMENT TO ENCOURAGE- A BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO USE REUSABLE SERVICE WHERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE THEIR OWN REDUCTION OF THEIR OWN COST- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN AND REALLY I THINK CURVE CONSUMPTION IN A WAY THAT'S MORE. ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUSED AND CONSCIENTIOUS OF OUR OWN USE IN OUR OWN WASTE- HERE IN THE STATE AND HOPEFULLY MAKE AN IMPACT ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THE CONTINUED COM. I THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD THAT WE ALSO GET TO REVISIT IN THE FUTURE AND SEE HOW IT GOES I'M- I'M PARTICULARLY JUST ALSO VERY. CONSCIENTIOUS OF THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE ON SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY RECOVER. RIGHT NOW WE MAY BE RECEIVING MULTIPLE THINGS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. BUT IT ISN'T BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BUSINESSES WANT TO DO BUT IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN LIVING THROUGH COVERED. AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SUPER CLEAN AND EXTRA PROTECTIONS. HOPEFULLY THAT GETS THE CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION AB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN REDUCING WASTE. I THINK A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THOSE INTERESTED. AND ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY. REDUCER OUR CONSUMPTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC AND SINGLE USE OF FOOD ACCESSORIES. AND WITH THAT I RESPECT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. TOPICAL. NUMBER FOUR AB TWELVE SEVENTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO THE MOTION IS DUE PROCESS DO PASSED AS AMENDED BUT FIRST. DO PASSED AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. SENATOR ALAN ALLEN AYE BATES DALI DALI NO GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN AYE STERN AYE MICHALSKI BY THE COUNTYON. NAPSTER OKAY THE BOOK THAT BILL HAS THE VOTES AGAIN AFTER WILL LEAVE THE ROLE TO FOR FOLKS TO ALLEN THANK YOU THE DECEMBER ISSUE IT. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NEXT GOING TO GO TO CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT ITEM TWO ON YOUR AGENDA MEMBERS THIS IS A- A. B. TEN EIGHTY SIX. RECEIVE IN WRITING. THE. I GUESS IT'S FAIR TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. AB TEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES A NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY TO COORDINATE WITH CAL EPA TO RECOMMEND A COORDINATED STRATEGY. BUT BUILT REDUCING EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTRY AGRICULTURE AND URBAN ORGANIC WASTE. REDUCING WILDFIRE LANDFILLING PILE BURNING OF ORGANIC WASTE ACROSS SECTORS IS CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR EXISTING CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY NEEDS AND GOALS. HOWEVER THE STATE LACKS A COORDINATED STRATEGY AND FUNDING PLANNED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFICIAL REUSE OF THESE ORGANIC MATERIALS. BENEFICIAL RE USE SUCH AS COMPOST BIO ENERGY OR SOIL AMENDMENTS CAN SUPPORT NET CARBON CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS IMPROVED AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. A STRATEGIC PLAN ON ORGANIC WASTE MANAGEMENT WILL PROVIDE LONG TERM TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND DATA INFORM RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO SUPPORT INCENTIVIZE THE BENEFICIAL RE USE OF ORGANIC WASTE. IT WILL CONSIDER AND BALANCE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION INCLUDING WILD FIRE SMOKE.

THANK YOU KERN ALLIANCE IN Q. THANK YOU LET'S BRING THIS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS ABOUT SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU- THE CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS- THIS IS THE ES YOU YOURSELF STATED AND- YOUR KEY WITNESS WE NEED THE STRATEGIC PLAN- INTERESTINGLY MOST FOR JURISDICTIONS AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER UNDER OUR REGIONAL- WASTE REDUCTION BILL AB NINE THIRTY NINE HAD TO DO WASTE COMPOSITION ANALYSIS. AND THOSE THAT HAD REALLY- ROBUST RECYCLING PROGRAMS FOUND THAT THEY WERE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB REMOVING THINGS LIKE PAPER AND- LIMON GLASS THINGS LIKE THAT FROM THERE- WE STREAM WITH THE- BIGGEST. THE LARGEST COMPONENT THAT WAS STILL IN THEIR WASTE STREAM IN THIS NO NO WE'RE NOT TALKING PLASTICS RIGHT NOW BUT- OTHERWISE. WAS ORGANIC WASTE. AND SO WE NOW KNOW MANY MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE MOVED TO. ORGANIC WASTE COLLECTION YOU KNOW I FORTUNATELY I LIVE SOMEWHERE WHERE I CAN HAVE BEEN I CAN PUT ALL MY YARD CLIPPINGS ALL MY DUTCH BOOKLET ALL MY FOOD IN THAT BEEN. HOWEVER AT SOME OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SUCH FACILITIES THAT SUPPORT OF WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE PUTTING SOMETHING IN A BIN. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S GOING TO GET. A UTILIZED IN THE WAY THAT WE- INTENT SO WILL IT IN FACT BE COMPOSTED WILL IT. BE POTENTIALLY USED FOR EXAMPLE FOR BIO ENERGY YOU KNOW THOSE ARE NOT THE GUARANTEES IT'S ONLY THAT YOU CAN PUT IT IN A BIT IN THIS STRATEGIC PLAN I THINK WILL HELP GIVE US. THAT ROAD MAP WHICH WE NEED BECAUSE ORGANIC WASTE HAS A LOT OF VALUE YEAH- SHOP I SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'M OF IT YEAH THANK YOU I WAS REMOVED BY CENTER SKINNER SENATE DOLLY. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL I WANT TO JUST. HAVE JERRY KNOW THAT. I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED- FONG. I AGREE WITH WHAT THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY SAID ABOUT ORGANIC WASTE IT'S 40% MORE FOOD IS THROWN AWAY NUMBER ONE WEEK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BE COMPOSTING THAT WE NEED TO BE PUTTING IT BACK INTO. OUR SOILS QUITE FRANKLY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BIOMASS IN LIKE WOULD WASTE. THEN YOU KNOW WE- WE RECYCLE. BOMBING HOLES WE MAKE ENERGY OUT OF THOSE- BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT. WHAT THE AIRBOARD DID WITH SB ONE HUNDRED DATE SO SB ONE HUNDRED PASSED AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IS COPING OF HOW SB IN. FOUR HUNDRED BUT LOOK. IF YOU READ THE REPORT. THERE THEY THEY WENT FURTHER THAN WHAT S. B. WHEN HER THEY THEY DON'T LIKE COMBUSTION THEY DON'T LIKE BURNING OF ANYTHING AND SO. I JUST WANT TO CAUTION I THINK THE MEMBERS THAT. IF YOU CAN DO IT IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT. AND ACTUALLY PRODUCE GREEN ENERGY. THERE'S A IT'S A LOT BETTER BENEFITS IN HAVING IT BURNT OPEN OR EVEN COMPOST OPEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING THAT COMES OUT. IN COMPANIES AND BY THE WAY THERE'S A BY PRODUCT TWO COMES OUT- BIO CHAR OR ASH WHICH IS VERY. GOOD FOR THE SOILS AS WELL. SO IT GOES FULL CIRCLE FIVE JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THE DETAILS MATTER AND HOW WE GET TO THE POINT WORK- THIS REPORT COMES BACK WE ACTUALLY START DOING IT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL- AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY IN IF IT'S NOT. A THERE TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WE NEED TO. RECYCLE OR REUSE OR- OR TAKE THE VALUE OUT OF WE NEED TO ALLOW THOSE. BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY BURN IT IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE ENERGY OUT OF IT BE USEFUL BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS NON COMBUSTION THAT MEANS NO FIRE. AND I THINK THAT'S FOR- VERY- I DON'T THINK THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE MOVED AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WE NEED MISSUS I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- BUT SOMEBODY HAS REALLY WORKED IN THIS FIELD A LOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WITH. LITERALLY BILLIONS OF TONS OF FOREST RESIDUE THAT IS IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW EMITTING CARBON LIKE CRAZY THERE'S THREE FIRES UP THERE AND THEY'RE EXPANDING EVERY DAY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS AND WE NEED IT INTEL WE GET TO. A HUNDRED PERCENT. WE CAN WE CAN LET'S TAKE THE NINETY EIGHT AND PUT IT THROUGH A- COGENERATION PLANT AND MAKE ELECTRICITY OUT OF AT LEAST SO I JUST. THOUGHT FOR MOVING FORWARD- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AT THAT I WAS SURPRISED HE DIDN'T SAY YOU'RE BACK AGAIN WITH THE SAME BILL I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE LOOKED AT THIS AND TRY TO GET AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. AND THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND YOU AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN UP IN THE AGRICULTURAL WORLD YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED OF THE FOREST- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING. RIGHT AND GIVE EVERYTHING A SHOT BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. BECAUSE THEY DO MEAN A LOT TO ME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. THE ITEM HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR SKINNER- IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- IS SIMPLY ASK FOR A VOTE. IN THIRD TIME'S A CHARM FIRST. EXCELLENT- SECRETARY BACK OF THIS OF. THE C. OF ITEM NUMBER TWO ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TEN EIGHTY SIX BYE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALLEN HI. ALLEN I BATES. ALI DALI I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I SKINNER WIENER AYE STERN STERN HIGHWAY CASKEY. ALL RIGHT WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN- BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE WILL TO GET OUT CONGRATULATIONS AND WILL LEVELS ARE OPEN FOR THE MEMBER SAID ON. THANK YOU GREAT OKAY THE LONG WAITING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA WHO'S HERE TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER FIVE A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE THIRTY FORTY FOUR THE SUMMER YOU MAY PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. RENDON CHANGED PROGRAM S. C. PEAS HAVE AN ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING HIV HEPATITIS C. AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL PROTECT THESE VITAL SERVICES BY PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS WITH AN EXEMPTION TO SEE CORE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RISE IN DRUG RELATED HARMS INCLUDING OVERDOSE DEATHS HEPATITIS C. DIAGNOSIS RATES AND INCREASED RATES OF POTENTIAL HIV TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCESS TO STERILE SYRINGES REDUCES HIV AND VIRAL HEPATITIS INFECTIONS WHILE BEING SAFE EFFECTIVE AND COST SAVING. CALIFORNIA'S S. C. P.'S PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SYRINGE ACCESS AND DISPOSAL INCLUDING HIV AND HEPATITIS TESTING OVERDOSE PREVENTION TRAINING AND REFERRALS TO DRUG TREATMENT HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE SERVICES HAVE HELPED TO GARNER THE TRUST IN PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE SEEK OUT HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES. BUT RECENTLY UNEXPECTED LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN DESPITE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE THAT THIS SECTION IS TO OPERATE NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW ONE COURT IN ORANGE COUNTY HAS INTERPRETED AS HE PEES AS PROJECTS. SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM COULD NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT I COLLECTED ALL THE SYRINGES THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED SUBSEQUENTLY THE PROGRAM WAS FORCED TO SHUT DOWN ANOTHER PROGRAM IN BUTTE COUNTY HAS BEEN FORCED TO RESEND IT CDPH APPROVED APPLICATION IN THE FACE OF SIMILAR LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY A SIMILAR LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST AN S. E. P. AND SANTA CRUZ IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE MUST BE REMINDED THAT THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPAND AS HE PEES IN OUR STATE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR LOOMING OPIOID PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AS EVIDENCED BY THE CDC. THE NEED FOR ACCESS TO SYRINGES AND OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. IS NOW GREATER THAN EVER. THESE TYPES OF SUITS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REQUIRING SEQUEL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS IMPROPERLY PLACES DISEASE PREVENTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AT ODDS. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION SERVICES PROVIDED BY NCP'S DIRECTLY AUTHORIZED BY THE CDPH WILL BE CURTAILED AND NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE DETERRED AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN THE NEED FOR THEM IS INCREASING. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL HELP TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM A RAPID SPREAD OF HIV HEPATITIS AND ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY DEADLY OR DISABLING INFECTIONS THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGH THE SHARING OF USED NEEDLES AND SYRINGES. BY PROTECTING THESE VALUABLE. COMMUNITY BASED S. C. P.'S. I'M JOINED TODAY BY MARICELA SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. YOUR DISPLAYS MERRY MERRY SILVA. HI GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF DR ANNUAL TEN MINUTE MERRY FALLEN ON YOUR JOURNEY THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL JOHN POLICY ALLIANCE THE NATIONAL HARM REDUCTION COALITION AND I PLAN T GO AID FOUNDATION.

SOME RECHARGE IT MOTION BUT IF YOU COULD CLAIM AGAINST YOUR INSURANCE PROGRAMS COULD GO FORWARD IF ONE PRELIMINARY RULING WITH NO FACTUAL FINDINGS CLOSE THE ORANGE COUNTY NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM AND LATER RESULT IN THE CLOSURE OF CHICO DURING SERVICE PROGRAM AS WELL WELL RECENTLY. USING THE FIRST LETTER FROM THE SAME THE TRYING TO BLOCK AN ORANGE COUNTY CASE RESULTED IN EUREKA P. ACTIVE TO OPERATING THE MOBILE ONE AND NOW STAND CRUZ. THE SAME. ALTHOUGH IT HAS NEVER BEEN MANY. FUELING THE FACT CLASSIC DURING PRO. THE CONCERN THREE WAY. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO. THAT WAY. NO INCREASED BY ORANGE PROGRAM. WE HEARING HOW. AND AROUND COUNTRY DONE AND THAT DURING THE WAY BETWEEN. NOT IN. WHEN PEOPLE ASK TO YOUR YOUR INSURANCE PROGRAM WHEN PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO DISPOSE SYRINGES THE USER. SIMPLY PUT THEIR INDEXING PARTS THE PHONE. TO YOUR ENJOY NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM. BY CONTRAST FROM PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS DO NOT HAVE SYRINGE EXCHANGE THE REASON SHARE SYRINGES. MORE OFTEN AND- EARLY. TO REQUIREMENTS GOES YOU HEALTH PROP PROJECT. IMPROPER PLACES DID YOU PREVENTION AND BY. PROTECTION THAT ALL. THE CDPH OF THE OF FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT ANY COULD LOOK. FOR THE ONE HELD THAT IT SHOULD HAVE THREE DOCTORS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOOD IT READ TRANSMISSION HIV I THE INCLUDED PEOPLE WHO USED TO AND TREATMENT AND WE.

BEIJING MEASURES SUPPORT FOR THE BILL ME PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD AGAIN THAT'S A ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO PLEASE. WE'LL GO TO LINE FIFTY EIGHT FIVE EIGHT. CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME'S ALEXANDER RODRIGUEZ WITH EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA ACTION REPORT A. B. ONE THREE FOUR FOUR. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME GREAT OKAY- I NOW I DO BELIEVE WE RISK DID RECEIVE SOME WITH OPPOSITION FROM NINE INDIVIDUALS AND- IS ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE HE WANTS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL. OPERATOR THANK YOU TO. THE STATE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN NAME PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN THAT'S A ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE PLEASE. THERE ARE NO LINES IN Q. GREAT OKAY LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS QUESTIONS CONCERNS SENATORS US. OKAY BILLS REMOVED FIGHTS. YES CENTER CASKEY MISTER NORMALLY I'M NOT ON THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION GRAVY TRAIN EVERY TIME A BILL COMES UP HERE BUT GIVEN THE CONCERNS HERE AND THAT AND THAT THE HEALTH EFFECTS I THINK IT'S A- IT'S A GOOD MEASUREMENT HOPE IT. I HOPE IT WORKS. YEP ALL RIGHT AS YES SENATOR DOLLY OF SERGEANT THERE'S GONNA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT AT LEAST ON THEIR- DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE MAY MAYBE THREE INDIVIDUALS BUT- I WILL SAY THAT IN MY EFFORT TO. CREATE THIS PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE IT TOOK ME A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION I THINK THAT AS THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD. NOT ONLY IS THIS VERY ESSENTIAL FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THE- THE BLOOD BORNE DISEASES THAT MEANS SADLY WE- I'VE SEEN IN A NUMBER OF OUR ENCAMPMENTS- SEVERE OUTBREAKS OF THE HELP- VIRUSES THAT UNFORTUNATELY CAN BE SPREAD. THROUGH CONTAMINATED SYRINGES AND THIS GREATLY REDUCES THOSE OUTBREAKS AND OF COURSE REDUCES THE WASTE NONE OF US WANT TO SEE- RENDON A PARKER IT YOU KNOW WHEREVER ON THE STREET AND SEE THESE DISCARDED SYRINGES SO I'M REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT. AND HAPPY TO- IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE A CO AUTHOR PRECIADO. THE SENATE THIRTY DOLLARS. WELL I GUESS I'M GONNA BE THE ONLY GUY THAT- FIRST OF ALL I KNOW IS STANDING UP FOR SECRET BRAND IT'S GOOD I KNOW AND I WANT TO. THIS IS REALLY BETWEEN AWKWARD SPOT BECAUSE I USUALLY VOTE FOR SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS BUT THERE IT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO JUST. TAKE A MINUTE MISTER CHECK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET OUT HERE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT. SHE WAS A GOOD LAW. THE REASON THAT WE HAVE SEEK WAS THAT. IF YOU HAVE IMPACTS THAT'S WHY YOU YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS. N. C. WAS BEEN USED FOR ALL KINDS OF MANIPULATION WHETHER IT'S- THE ONE GRAVEL MINING COMPANY SEQUENT ANOTHER GRAVEL MINING COMPANY TO BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO COMPETITION WHETHER IT'S LABOR AGREEMENTS WHETHER IT'S- PUTTING UP AN ARENA WE WE'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF ABUSES OF SEQUEL BUT SEQUEL ACTUALLY IS A REALLY GOOD LAW. AND THE REASON WE HAVE SEQUENCE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SO THAT WE MAY MITIGATE IMPACTS. I'VE DON'T REPRESENT ANYMORE BUT I USED TO REPRESENT YOU COUNTY WHERE THE LAWSUIT CAME FROM IS ONE OF THE LAWSUITS. WHERE YOU HAVE A DISPENSARY AND A COLLECTION BUT IT UNFORTUNATELY THEY- DID OR NOT ALL GETTING COLLECTED VERY FACT VERY FEW OF THEM ARE GETTING COLLECTED A LOT OF THEM BEING DISPERSED. AND IT IN A SAFE ZONE BUT THERE ARE GETTING CORRECTED AND SO WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE. A PROBLEM YOU CAN IF THERE'S A- NEEDLE THIS BEEN USED YOU CAN GET HEPATITIS FROM THAT NEED TO LIVE IT'S- NOT BEEN RECYCLED PROPERLY. THAT'S WHY THERE'S LAWSUIT AND SO FOR ME WE'RE GONNA JUST CARVED THIS OUT NOW AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SEEK WERE. AND THEN THERE'S A REAL GOOD REASON THAT WE HAVE SEQUENCE BECAUSE THERE ARE CONFLICTS HERE. SO FOR ME IT'S LIKE I'D LOOK I WANT TO RECYCLE ALL THE STUFF THAT NEED TO BE SO I WANT TO PUT IT THE RIGHT WAY STREAM. BUT THE LAW FOR SEQUEL IS GOOD IN THIS CASE IT'S- WAY TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AND WHEN THEY DON'T GET MITIGATED. WE GO TO COURT. AND SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S N. STREET IN CHICO. THEY WERE GET THERE'S THE PARK WAS FILLED WITH WHERE KIDS ARE GOING TO PLAY WITH USED NEEDLES. THAT'S IMPACTED I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TO HAVE TO FACE AND THATS WHY WE HAVE SECRET SO THAT YOU MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTED OR NOT PUT IN PLACES WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE. SO I HAVE I VOTED FOR A LOT OF SECRET EXAMS BECAUSE I THINK TO SEEK WAS BEEN EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE. WE GOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS BEEN MITIGATED. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M NOT REAL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I. UNFORTUNATELY IT'LL BE THE FIRST SECRET EXEMPTION BILL IF VOTED AGAINST. BECAUSE I LIKE TO I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME WORK ON C. QUITE REALLY DO IT NEEDS TO BE. FAIR AND IT'S NOT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S USED IN SO MANY SITUATIONS TO LEVERAGE SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET SOMETHING. WE ARE VERY VERY PUBLIC IN SAYING THAT READ THE ORIGINAL SEQUEL LAW WAS MEANT FOR IT WAS. A GOOD IT WAS GOOD LAW. BUT IT'S BEEN USED IN SO MANY BAD WAYS IN AND WE DISCUSS DIFFERENT THAT I MEAN I DON'T THINK THE- CHAIRMAN MAYBE IS VOTED FOR IN THE SECRET EXEMPTIONS IS THAT. IN THE PAST MAYBE FEW BUT- SO FOR THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I HAVE I HAVE I GUESS I WOULD JUST POINT A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL THERE ARE THERE ARE- SEVERAL- A MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE. STILL REQUIRED INTO THIS BILL THEM THERE OUTLINED ON PAGE FOUR. INDICATES FIVE NOTICE PUBLIC FRUSTRATION. THE OTHER THING JUST TO MENTION. IS THAT NO PROJECT WILL MOVE FOR THE SPELL WITHOUT THE FULL. COOPERATION OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. I'M AND YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW. THAT CITY COUNCILS A VERY. INTERESTING PUBLIC COMMENT AND GIVE FOLKS SOME COMMON. RAISE WHATEVER CONCERNS THEY HAVE THEIR- IN ADDITION TO THE- TO THE TO THE PUBLIC INPUT. THAT WE'VE PUT INTO THE BILL THAT THAT ARE IN THE BILL. THE OTHER THING I SHOULD MENTION IS THAT. YOU UP SEE RIGHT. THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH WITH. YOUR NEEDLE LITTER. IF ANYTHING KIND OF BUILDING PINE CENTER SKINNER COMMENTS. ASIF SITE THAT IS ACTUALLY PROPERLY MANAGED IS ACTUALLY FAR LESS LIKELY TO RESULT IN. DANGEROUS I NEED A LETTER AND THEN OF AN UNREGULATED. FREE FOR ALL WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE OUT ON OUR STREETS RIGHT NOW SO. THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL- I BETTER BUT BUT YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE YOUR YOUR POINT ARE WELL TAKEN CERTAINLY KNOW I THIS IS A NAME. THIS IS LIKE NOBODY WISHES WE WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE EVEN THIS WAS EVEN A THING RIGHT I MEAN HOW TERRIBLE IS IT THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE HAVING TO- FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCOMMODATE. AND THE REALITY OF THIS. OUT OF CONTROL DRUG USE THAT EXIST. IN OUR STREETS. AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BROAD ISSUE THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON SO THAT WE NEVER NEED TO HAVE THIS KIND OF. THESE KINDS OF SITES. ANY OUT- NOT SEEING ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER SKINNER- IF YOU HAVE ANY. YOUR RESPONSE OR IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE SONG EVER. WE WELCOME THAT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR THE CONVERSATION AS WELL AS FOR SOME OF THE DISAGREEMENTS THAT WE MATH. I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST SEQUEL EXEMPTION I BELIEVE I HAVE EVER CARRIED WHILE IN OFFICE. AND TO BELIEVE IT WAS NECESSARY FOR US TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WAS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW. HI I WOULD LIKE TO IF I COULD SENATOR ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE WHICH WAS THAT SEEK WELL WHICH IS TO BE BROUGHT IN IF THERE ARE IMPACTS. AND WHAT THE RESEARCH IS SHOWING US IS THAT THERE ARE LESS IMPACTS LESS SYRINGES WHEN THE SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS ARE IN COMMUNITIES. HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS HAS BEEN DONE AROUND THE UNITED STATES BUT IT'S BEEN FAIRLY WELL STUDIED- AND BELIEVE IT'S QUITE CONVINCING- FOR THE- WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING REGARDING IMPACTS. I WOULD FOLLOW UP THAT THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE AVENUE FOR THEM TO LITIGATE IF THEY ALL HAVE CONCERNS AND THAT IS A NUISANCE PROVISION. THAT I THINK IS CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THE COURTS AND SO EVEN IF WE ARE TO EXEMPT- S. C. P.'S FROM SEQUOIA BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LOCALS TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND- AT PURSUE THAT AVENUE. WITH THAT I WILL THANK VERY MUCH THIS COMMITTEE AND.
