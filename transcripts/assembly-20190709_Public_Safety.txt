BEGIN ONCE WE BRING IN THE ABSENT MEMBERS. AND WE NEED SOME AUTHORS. SOME SENATE AUTHORS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SENATOR WINNER -- SINCE WE ARE. WE HAVE SEVERAL ITEMS AND WE ARE PRESSED FOR TIME -- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- UNTIL. ALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS GET HERE. AND IF YOU DON'T MIND IF WE DO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE A QUORUM I MAY INTERRUPT YOU. SO INSTEAD IS A QUORUM AND THEN CONTINUE -- BUT FOR RIGHT NOW -- AS YOU KNOW IN SENATE'S. PUBLIC SAFETY IS SOMETIMES. DIFFICULT TO GET A QUORUM SO -- WE HAVE THREE FOUR MEMBERS HERE WHEN YOU. READ SHY IS NEED ONE MORE. SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR ITEM NUMBER TWO SB ONE FOUR FIVE SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU -- YOU AND YOUR CREW SUFFER WORKING WITH US WE ARE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THEY CAME OUT OF WORK. WORK THEM OUT AFTER THE COMMITTEE -- AND NOW SAYS. AND THOSE ARE AMENDMENTS WILL DELETE -- THE THE PROVISION IN THE BILL RELATING TO JESSICA'S LAW -- AND REMOVE THAT ENTIRELY -- FROM THE BILL -- I'LL BE HONEST THAT ARE -- THAT AMENDMENT -- NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE AND IN THE SENATE AND I APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND I'M HAPPY TO REMOVE IT -- JESSICA'S LAW WHICH AYE OPPOSED -- IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND NOTHING FROM JESSICA'S Là EVER SORT OF GONE IN THIS THAT'LL BE REMOVED IN ITS ENTIRELY I SAY THIS JUST TO BE CLEAR WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- SO COLLEAGUES. SENATE BILL -- ONE FORTY FIVE PUTS AN END TO A SIGNIFICANT -- DISCRIMINATION AND IRRATIONALITY -- IN CALIFORNIA AS A SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY AS IT RELATES -- TO YOUNG PEOPLE. CURRENTLY AND THIS IS THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IN THE LAW -- IF A IF STATUTORY RAPE OCCURS IN THIS BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CHANGE. WHAT'S A CRIME OR WHAT'S NOT A CRIME OR WHAT'S THE PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES ONLY ABOUT WHO. MUST GO ON THE REGISTRY IN WHO -- A JUDGE MAY KEEP OFF. I'M CURRENTLY IF I STATURE RIPPER KERR'S AND THE YOUNGER PERSON AT AGE. FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN THE OLDER PERSON -- IS WITHIN TEN YEARS NO MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLDER -- IF IT IS -- VAGINAL PENILE INTERCOURSE -- THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION WHETHER TO PUT THE PERSON ON THE REGISTRY OR NOT BUT THE PERSON ON THE REGISTRY BASED ON THE FACTS. OF THE CASE OVER EXAMPLE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. HAVING -- INTERCOURSE WITH HIS SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND -- IS PROBABLY NOT VERY LIKELY TO BE PUT ON THE REGISTRY TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD HAVING SEX WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE PUT ON ON HOWEVER. ON FOR EVERY OTHER FORM OF INTERCOURSE. A JUDGE IS MANDATED TO PUT THE PERSON ON THE REGISTRY -- CANNOT TAKE ANY OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE INTO A CAL HAS NO DISCRETION. I THE REASON FOR THIS DISTINCTION WHICH IS BOTH DISCRIMINATORY AND IRRATIONAL IS BECAUSE ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN FORTIES -- THE ONLY LEGAL FORM OF INTERCOURSE WAS VAGINAL PL INTERCOURSE EVERYTHINGELSE WAS BANNED -- SO WE HAVE THIS BASICALLY LEFT OVER FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES -- AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT -- IS IT WHAT IT MEANS. IS THAT -- YOU HAVE IRRATIONALITY SO THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HAS VAGINAL INTERCOURSE OF THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND THE JUDGE DOESN'T HAVE TO PUT HIM ON THE REGISTRY. BUT IF SHE PERFORMS ORAL SEX ON HIM -- I'M SORRY TO BE EXPLICIT BUT THAT'S WHAT SIX HUNDRED STREET ABOUT. SHE PERFORMS ORAL SEX ON HIM THE JUDGE MUST PUT HIM ON THE REGISTRY THAT IS BEYOND IRRATIONAL -- AND THE BILL ALSO OR EXCUSE ME THAT THIS STATE OF THE LAW ALSO CREATES A SIGNIFICANT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT. YOUNG PEOPLE -- WHO ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND -- VAGINAL PENILE INTERCOURSE -- AND SO WE ARE SEEING -- YOUNG LGBT PEOPLE WHO WERE BEING FORCED ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE NINE LGBT -- COUNTERPARTS WOULD NOT BE FORCED ONTO THE REGISTRY -- AND SO WHAT SB ONE FORTY FIVE DOES -- IS IT TREATS ALL FORMS OF INTERCOURSE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT WE CURRENTLY THREE UNDER THE LAW -- VAGINAL INTERCOURSE I DOES NOT CREATE ANY KIND OF NEW STRUCTURE OR NEW TEST IT JUST SAYS LET'S TREAT ALL FORMS OF INTERCOURSE THE SAME WAY THAT WE CURRENTLY TREAT. VAGINAL INTERCOURSE -- I WILL NOTE -- AND I SAID THIS AND SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY -- TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN THIS -- THE STATION AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS AN EQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION -- IN THE HAWKS SIRE CASE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THAT WAS THE CORRECT RULING -- AND UNDER THE RULING I WOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO BE HERE TODAY -- IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT -- I THINK SHAMEFULLY OVERTURNED -- IT'S TWO THOUSAND SIX RULING AND SAID THAT IT WAS OKAY TO HAVE THIS DISCRIMINATION -- THIS. ARE BILL AND I KNOW THE CHAIR HAS ALSO WORKED ON THIS ISSUE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. OUR WILL AND THIS IS DISCRIMINATION ONCE AND FOR ALL AND THIS ORIGINALITY -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I WITH ME TODAY -- IS OUT -- DENTAL SADO FROM THE LOS ANGELES DA'S OFFICE -- ONE OF OUR SPONSORS I WILL NOTE THAT BOTH THE THE LA DA IS IS ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ALONG WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. I'M THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION BOTH A SUPPORT THE BILL. I IN ADDITION JANET NEARLY ON A LAWYER WHO SPECIALIZES IN THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES YOU MAY BEGIN. MR MEMBERS SAMPLES OUT ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. PLEASE SPONSOR SB ONE FORTY FIVE ALONG WITH THAT QUALITY CALIFORNIA. AS A SENATOR POINTED OUT FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE -- THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA. THE CULTURE OFFENSES VOLUNTARY -- SEX ACTS BETWEEN AN ADULT AND A MINOR -- WITHIN TEN YEARS OF AGE ONE ANOTHER -- WE'RE NOT RICH FULL OFFENSE HOWEVER IN THE JOHNSON DECISION THE SUPREME COURT DID NOTE THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATUTORY RAPE AND THESE OTHER ACTS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT STATUTORY RAPE CAN RESULT IN PREGNANCY AND THAT'S WHERE THEY LEFT IT. WHAT THE COURT FAILED TO NOTE THOUGH IS THAT? IN A CRIMINAL ACT. IF A PREGNANCY A CURSE PREGNANCY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. THEREFORE THE COURT WAS SAYING. EVEN THOUGH STATUTORY RAPE THAT RESULTS IN PREGNANCY IS A MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE WE'RE GONNA TREATED MORE LENIENTLY. THAT IS IRRATIONAL BOTH FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AND FROM AN EQUAL PROTECTION STANDPOINT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SPONSORING SB -- ONE FORTY FIVE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. ATTORNEY GENERAL CITY ATTORNEY'S STILL HAVE ALL OF THEIR CHARGING DISCRETION. TO YOU CHARGE APPROPRIATELY ACTS THAT ARE NOT VOLUNTARY NOT CONSENSUAL -- ALSO UNDER EXISTING LAW UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TO NINETY POINT ZERO ZERO SIX THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE COURTS HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SEEK REGISTRATION FOR ANY OFFENSE. THAT DOES NOT CHANGE UNDER SB ONE FORTY FIVE AS A SENATOR NOTED IF WE HAVE INSTANCES WITH A A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD -- HAVING RELATIONS WITH A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD THOSE CASES ARE GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AND SEEK REGISTRATION WE CURRENTLY DO THAT. DAY IN LA THAT IT WILL NOT CHANGE -- I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE REGISTRY. IS TO ACT AS AN INVESTIGATORY TOOL WHEN THERE ARE NEW SEX CRIMES THAT OCCUR WE DON'T HAVE SUSPECTS. IT'S ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE A TOOL TO USE TO KEEP TRACK OF PREDATORY OFFENDERS. IN THESE CASES. THEY'RE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT THESE OFFENSES. DON'T COMMITTEES OTHER TYPES OF CRIMES THAT'S ONE TWO ONE OFFENDERS UNDER OUR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION STATUTE. THERE'S NO STRANGER YOU KNOW CRIMES INVOLVED IN HERE THEY ARE NOT PREDATORY. THEY DON'T THE THE SOLVE ANY NEW CRIMES SO EVEN INCLUDING THESE PEOPLE ON THE REGISTRY AND JUST AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE. DOES NOT COMPLY WITH WHAT THE PURPOSE OF OUR REGISTRY IS. AND THE COURTS HAVE COMPLETELY TOLD. GROUPS COULD REPORTEDLY TOLD US -- THAT IF WE DO NOT USE THE REGISTRY FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE THEY WOULD STRIKE IT DOWN. PASSING THIS BILL WILL NOT ONLY DO THE RIGHT THING COULD HELP PRESERVE OUR EXISTING REGISTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES MA'AM. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JANET NEARLY I AM A LEGAL CONSULTANT TO CAL CASA CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. PART OF THE DATA BEFORE -- MY RETIREMENT I REPRESENTED THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY AS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I CHAIRED THE CALIFORNIA STATE COMMITTEE ON SEX AND A RISK ASSESSMENT. FOR TEN YEARS. ON AND IN MY CAPACITY THERE I WROTE MANY OF THE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA PERTAINING TO THE REGISTRATION MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF SEX OFFENDERS. IN MY OPINION THIS CHANGE IN THE REGISTRY LAW IS LONG OVERDUE. THE PURPOSE OF OUR REGISTRY. IS TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT. CATCH PEOPLE WHO IT MAKE. HAVE HAVE HAVE MADE. UP A GROUP REGIS OFFENSES AGAINST STRANGER VICTIMS BUT THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THIS BILL CONCERNS HAVE NOT ATTACKED STRANGERS. THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY LOW RISK OFFENDERS. AND I'M LIKELY TO COMMIT A SECOND OFFENSE AT ALL ONCE THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT AND SANCTIONED FOR THE OFFENSE THAT THEY COMMITTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT IF THEY DO RE OFFEND IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY IT WILL BE THE TYPE OF STRANGER OFFENSE THAT REQUIRES THEM TO BE IN THE REGISTRY. SO PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE REGISTRY WHO REALLY AREN'T GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT SOLVE STRANGER PERPETRATED CRIMES. ACTUALLY MAKES IT HARDER FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THEIR JOB WHICH IS SOLVING THOSE TYPES OF CASES -- FOR THOSE REASONS I SUPPORT SENATE BILL ONE FOUR FIVE AND I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MARK -- GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT WHO?

GOOD MORNING I'M DAN FROM EL DORADO COUNTY AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M DAVID HERON FROM EL DORADO COUNTY I URGE YOU TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. MARY HARRON ELDORADO COUNTY PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. I WILL BE BRIEF AND I FEEL QUITE LONELY UP HERE -- MY NAME IS HEIDI FELDSTEIN. AND I'M HERE FROM LOS ANGELES AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I FEEL -- AS THOUGH I HAD TO SPEAK UP ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE I STRONGLY SUPPORT. EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE A DISTINCTION. AND HOW THE LAW TREATS DIFFERENT KINDS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY. WHETHER IT BE MINOR OR MAJOR HERE IS MY PROBLEM. EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES THERE ARE TWO AREAS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. STATUTORY RAPE UNDER TO SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE STILL HAS A ROMEO AND JULIET CLAUSE. WHERE? TWO SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE WHICH IS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE VAGINAL PENILE INTERCOURSE. STILL HAS WHAT'S CALLED A ROMEO AND JULIET CLOCKS. MINERS WITHIN THREE YEARS OF ONE ANOTHER. ARE NOT GUILTY OF STATUTORY RAPE UNDER TO SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE IT'S STE THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY. THAT DOES NOT CARRY OVER FOR ANAL INTERCOURSE ORAL COPULATION OR PENETRATION WITH AN OBJECT OTHER THAN A **** AND AGAIN I'M SORRY TO BE SO BLUNT BUT THE PENAL CODE IS THAT BLUNT. OKAY. SOMETIMES I AM BUT NOT HERE -- SO THERE IS STILL NOT EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW SO THIS IS NOT REALLY ABOUT EQUAL PROTECTION. THE SECOND THING IS THAT STATUTORY RAPE. DISCRETION IS NOT GIVEN TO THE JUDGE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AGE DIFFERENCE. SHE COULD HAVE A FIFTY YEAR OLD MAN. WITH A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. AND REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED. SO AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THIS BILL IS FLAWED. IT ISN'T ABOUT EQUAL PROTECTION. BECAUSE I'M HERE BECAUSE OF EQUAL PROTECTION FOR THE MINERS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT EQUAL PROTECTION FOR THE ADULTS. WHO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH OUR FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS? I THINK THE DA'S ATTORNEYS OFFICESCORRECT. OKAY IF SOMEONE IS FOURTEEN OR UNDER WE HAVE OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW WITH WHICH TO PROTECT THEM. AND TO REGISTER THEM I THINK THE DA'S ATTORNEY IS WRONG. IN SAYING THAT THIS REGISTER IS ONLY FOR USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR PARENTS. USED THIS REGISTERED TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE THE MOST HEAVILY TRAFFICKED HUMANBEINGS IN THIS COUNTRY WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN IN THE NEWS EVERY DAY WITH THE NEWS COMING OUT ABOUT SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS ANNOUNCING. THAT THEY BASICALLY RAPED A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND A JUDGE SAYING THE BECAUSE THEY CAME FROM A GOOD FAMILY AND GOT GOOD GRADES. THEY'RE GOING TO GET LEFT OFF THE HOOK. THIS IS THE WRONG TIME. TO BE PASSING THIS KIND OF A BILL THAT IS CANDIDLY BEING PERCEIVED BY PRIVATE CITIZENS LIKE ME. AS EXPOSING OUR DAUGHTERS TO WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE TRIPLE CHERRY IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING PLEASE I URGE YOU. FIND A WAY TO GIVE EQUAL PROTECTION TO OUR MINERS. YES CRIMINALIZE AND REGISTER ALL KINDS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY AT THE SAME RATE BUT DO IT IN A WAY OTHER THAN DECLARING OPEN SEASON ON OUR TEENAGERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] MR QUIRK. I'M LET'S SEE WOULD YOU -- ESTABLISH CORN SO I CAN MOVE THE BALL. THE STEPS OF CORN. JONES SAWYER HERE LACKEY. BARRICADE HAND. DEEP. KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK YOUR SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS [inaudible] FORMS PRESIDENT. MOVE THE BELL [inaudible] THE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THE RK THREE JUST I'M CENTER WE ARE CAN YOU CLARIFY THE AMENDMENT THE YOU MENTIONED THE BEGINNING I WAS TRYING. TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE LA SURE ON AND THIS IS AYE. THIS IS OF I'VE BEEN A PROCESS BETWEEN US AND LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AND WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN BOTH HOUSES FOR WORKING WITH US. ON THEIR IT HAS TO DO WITH JESSICA'S LAW THAT WAS PASSED. TWELVE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO THE BASICALLY PROVIDED THAT -- SEX OFFENDERS CAN'T LIVE IN CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN CERTAIN DISTANCE OF A PARK SCHOOL IT CETERA -- IT'S BEEN A LOT OF IT'S BEEN STRUCK DOWN AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT EFFECTIVELY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR SEX OFFENDERS IN MANY CITIES TO LIVE ANYWHERE. ON SO FOR SOME IN THE HOMELESSNESS IN WHICH OF COURSE CAUSES PEOPLE -- TO BE MORE LIKELY TO REOFFEND IF THEY DON'T PLACE TO LOOK -- SO THE WE THERE WAS SOME LANGUAGE OF WE HAVE PLAYED AND ABOUT EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE NOT ON THE REGISTRY BUT COMMITTED THE OFFENSES THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF JESSICA'S LAW -- WE SHOULD I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO THE BILL AND SO WE'RE TAKING IT OUT OF SOMEONE'S ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY -- THEY'RE NOT BOUND BY JESSICA'S LAW IT ONLY AFFECTS THE THE ALLEGATION THE CRIMES THAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING HERE YEAH SO IT. YES OKAY YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT US BECAUSE ALL THE COURTS ARE HANDLING NOT. AND STRUCK DOWN QUITE A FEW ASPECTS OF JESSICA'S LAW BUT AS FOR THESE OFFENSES THAT ONLY FOR PEOPLE RIGHT ONLY FOR THESE OFFENSES AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON REGISTER ON THE REGISTER WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT JESSICA ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUICK THIS COME OUT OF THANK YOU -- SENATOR WIENER SO CAN YOU SORT OF RESPOND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS IN YOUR CLOTHES OR NOT BUT COULD YOU ALL RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK THE BILL DOESN'T SPECIFY. IT'S FOR LGBT Q. ONLY AND SO AS A RESULT. THERE. COULD BE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE TO SUGGEST YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MINERS. THAT -- IT WILL KIND OF OPEN A DOOR FOR FOLKS TO ENGAGE IN PREDATORY BEHAVIOR SO. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND -- THE FIRST PART OF WHAT THE OPPONENTS SAID -- I THOUGHT SHE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING AND AND AWAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- BECAUSE SHE POINTED THERE ARE MANY OTHER THERE ARE OTHER AREAS DISCRIMINATION IN THE JUST THE DEFINITION OF STATUTORY RAPE -- DISCRIMINATES AGAINST -- LGBT. YOUNG PEOPLE. SO THAT'S BUT YOU CAN'T SOLVE EVERYTHING ON ONE BILL -- THE THE OPPONENT THE IDEA THAT THIS BILL. QUOTE ON QUOTE CREATES OPENS THE SEASON OR WHATEVER SHE HOWEVER SHE PHRASE -- ON PREYING ON TEENAGERS -- IS -- I I COULD NOT DISAGREE WITH THAT MORE THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE WHAT'S A CRIME OR WHAT IS IT A CRIME. IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHAT THE WHAT THE PUNISHMENT IS FOR ANY CRIME THAT'S ALL GOING TO BE THE SAME. I A IF THIS PASSES ON JANUARY FIRST AS IT IS TODAY -- SO THE THE THE DEFINITION OF A CRIME THE PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIME. DOESN'T CHANGE -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE IS IT GIVES JUDGES? DISCRETION. TO THE SIDE IF SOMEONE SHOULD BE ON THE REGISTER OR NOT. AT ALL WE ARE SAYING IS THAT AND WE TALK ABOUT YOUR JEFFREY OBSCENE OR WHATEVER WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW TEENAGE GIRLS WHO WERE -- ABUSED. RIGHT TODAY [inaudible] TODAY. IF THAT INTERCOURSE AGAIN DISCIPLINE TWELVE YEARS SINCE I'VE SEEN AS FAR OLDER THAN THAT -- TODAY. I IF IT'S VAGINAL INTERCOURSE AND IT'S FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD THE OLDER PERSON IF WITHIN TEN YEARS TO THAT. THE JUDGE HAS DISCRETION TO EITHER PUT THE PERSON ON OR NOT BUT THE PERSON ON ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT OTHER FORMS OF INTERCOURSE. SHOULD BE TREATED EXACTLY THE SAME AS WE CURRENTLY AND FOR MANY YEARS HAVE TREATED VAGINAL INTERCOURSE WHY ON EARTH ARE WE GONNA SAY. OKAY IF YOU HAVE BAD JOURNAL IF THE TWENTY YEAR OLD HAS VAGINAL INTERCOURSE WITH THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT. HIM ON THE REGISTRY. BUT IF SHE PERFORMED ORAL SEX ON HIM. AUTOMATIC BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE ORAL SEX IS SOMEHOW WORSE THAN VAGINAL INTERCOURSE I MEAN ON ITS FACE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHATTHE LAW DOES. IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL -- AND AT IN ADDITION TO HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. ON LGBT USE SO THIS WILL NOT DEPRIVED JUDGES OF THE ABILITY SO YOU KNOW WHAT. OKAY YOU'RE JUST YOU'RE HAVING SEX WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND WHO'S ELEVEN MONTHS YOUNGER THAN THAN YOU I'M NOT PUTTING YOU ON THE REGISTRY. YOU ARE PRAYING ON A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD I'M PUTTING YOU ON THE REGISTRY -- SO WE WE STILL GIVE THE JUDGES ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I IS THAT YOUR CLOSER. I I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW THE THIS THIS IS A HARD TOPIC -- ANYTIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES IT'S REALLY HARD -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE ABUSING AND PREYING. ON PEOPLE AND YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE PUNISHED. AND THAT WE USE ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE -- BY. WAY THOUGH THOSE SCOPE OF THE REGISTER RIGHT NOW. IS PUTTING PEOPLE ON TO THE REGISTRY SHOULD NOT BE ON THE REGISTRY. AND WE ARE TELLING JUDGES YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO EXERCISE ANY DISCRETION. I'M GOING ON TO THE REGISTRY -- CAN HELP TRUST RACK SOMEONE'S LIFE THIS IS A BIG DEAL AT ALL WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S. TREAT EVERYTHING THE WAY WE CURRENTLY CHIU BASIL INTERCOURSE.

AND I WORK WITH -- LAW. UNDER EXISTING LAW -- USUALLY FONG RISING WATER. FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED CRIMES -- YOU CAN'T USE THE INFORMATION OTHER SERIOUS FELONIES COULD BE USED IN A PROSECUTION. OF THOSE WHOSE INFORMATION IS IS COLLECTED BY A WIRE TAP -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS AMENDMENTS AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD -- INCLUDE ALL. SIXTEEN A SERIOUS OFFENSES I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS AND AND I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS HERE TO TESTIFY IS DAN -- FELICITY ALTHOUGH FROM THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MARK BURNLEY. OF ASSISTANT HEAD DEPUTY A MAJOR NARCOTICS DIVISION. YES MISTER FIELDS I KNOW. SHERMAN MEMBERS -- DEVILS OUT ON BEHALF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR -- CENTER ON BIRDS BILL -- AS A SENATOR INDICATED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO OBTAIN WIRETAPS FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED TYPES OF CRIMES BASICALLY MAJOR NARCOTICS OFFENSES. MURDERS GANG CRIMES -- HUMAN TRAFFICKING --WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. HOWEVER WHILE WERE INVESTIGATING THOSE CRIMES. WE ARE LISTENING IN ON THE INTERCEPT MEDICATIONS. AND WE OFTEN -- WE'LL HEAR INDIVIDUALS START TALKING ABOUT OTHER CRIMES THEY'VE COMMITTED THESE ARE. YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS THEY COMMIT OTHER CRIMES -- UNDER EXISTING LAW IF AN INDIVIDUAL -- TALK ABOUT COMMITTING A VIOLENT FELONY. IF WE GET THE PERMISSION OF THE COURT WE CAN USE THAT STATEMENT REGARDING THE VIOLENT FELONY AGAINST THAT. HOWEVER IF WE HEAR EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VIOLENT FELONY OR ONE OF THE PREDICATE OFFENSES. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THAT INFORMATION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL AT ANY TIME -- AS AMENDED SP FOUR THIRTY NINE WOULD MAKE WOULD ADD TWO NEW OFFENSIVES. GUN VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS CRIME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OBVIOUSLY IF WE HEAR SOMEBODY WHO'S TALKING ABOUT PLANTING A DESTRUCTIVE DEVICE A BALL -- IN YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC BUILDING OF THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS CRIMES AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION. IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION SO LONG AS THE COURT APPROVED THE USE OF THAT INFORMATION -- THIS BILL I SAY IT IS IT'S A MORE NARROW THEN -- HAS INTRODUCED HOWEVER WE STILL THINK THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT BILL -- ESPECIALLY FOR RBC QUE SE GUN VIOLENCE AND BOMBINGS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK THANK YOU THANKS A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MARK BURNLEY I'M THE ASSISTANT HEAD DEPUTY OF THE MAJOR COLLEGE DIVISION. FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MY DIVISION HANDLES ALL OF THE WIRE TAPS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS FAR AS PROCESSING THEM. AND SENDING THEM TO THE COURT. WHAT THIS BILL REALLY TALKS ABOUT IS WHAT I CALL INCIDENTAL INTERCEPTS AS MR FELLOWS ARE JUST EXPLAINED? WHY WERE UP ON A LAWFULLY OBTAINED WIRE TAP WE FREQUENTLY INTERCEPT OTHER CRIMES THAT THE WIRE TAP WAS NOT OBTAIN? FOR WITH THIS LEGISLATION WOULD DO WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF THOSE INTERCEPTS IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. WHAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT DO IS IT DOES NOT EXPAND? IN ANY WAY THE LIST OF ENUMERATED OFFENSES FOR WHICH YOU COULD INITIALLY OBTAIN A WIRETAP SO THAT LIST WHICH IS IN THE STATUTE DOES NOT GET EXPANDED THIS ONLY. WOULD APPLY TO INCIDENTAL INTERCEPTS IT ALSO DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE STATUTE -- WE WOULD HAVE TO STILL MINIMIZE CONVERSATIONS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WOULD HAVE TO SEEK JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION. IF WE WANTED TO USE THESE INCIDENTAL INTERCEPTS IN ANY MANNER. AS A SENATOR JUST EXPLAINED. WITH GUN VIOLENCE CURRENTLY IF WE INTERCEPTED ANY CALLS REGARDING GUNS THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD USE THOSE CALLS ONLY TO PREVENT THE COMMISSION OF A PUBLIC OFFENSE HOWEVER. THE CONTENT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE USED TO PROSECUTE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD ACTUALLY STONE THOSE FIREARMS. AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYONE MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE AREA. JOHN OF THE FILM OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH REPORTING LANGUAGE THAT WAS DRAFTED AND WE SENT TO US FOR OF YOU LAST NIGHT BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE SENATE IS OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR QUIRK. UP MOVE THE BELL -- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE -- PRIVACY. AGAINST -- GETTING THE BAD GUYS. AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS -- LAW TO TAKE ON AS ONE OF YOUR FIRST LAWS I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT AND COURSE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES MISS CONNELLY DOVE -- YES I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL SO THE HEAT I WOULD LIKE FOR A TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY WITH THEM WHAT I HEARD FROM THIS GENTLEMAN -- BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WIRE TAPPING -- IS A SORT OF AN INVASION OF PRIVACY AND ONCE YOU HEAR SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T ERASE THAT FROM YOUR MEMORY AND SO THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS -- THAT IT WILL SORT OF CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN END RUN AROUND -- THE LAW SO THAT YOU CAN CATCH THE CRIMINAL -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONCE YOUR WIRE TAPPING YOU GET INCIDENTAL INFORMATION YOU SAY HEY THERE'S ANOTHER CRIME EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T AUTHORIZED TO WIRE TAP FOR THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW DO WE CREATE AN INFERENCE SO THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GET IT. AND THAT IS JUST. YOU KNOW. NOT RIGHT SO THAT'S HOW I SO THEN WHEN I HEARD YOU SAY. YOU KNOW YOU'RE PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY AND ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO I'M HOPING THAT I MISS HEARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS AT LEAST TWICE A DAY FOR ME -- SO CAN YOU CENTER PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AS TO HOW THIS DOES NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO ALLOW FOR AN IN RUN -- IF FIRST OF ALL IF I A MADE AN IMPRESSION IT WAS COMPLETELY -- UNINTENTIONAL. TO OBTAIN A WIRETAP I LIKE TO REFER TO AS A WIRE TAP AFFIDAVIT AS A SEARCH WARRANT ON STEROIDS. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO PROBABLE CAUSE THAT THERE WAS A COMMISSION OF ONLY CERTAIN ENUMERATED DEFENSES THAT ARE LISTED IN THE STATUTE. SO WHEN WHEN THE WIRETAP AFFIDAVIT IS SUBMITTED TO THE JUDICIAL OFFICER FOR APPROVAL. WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE THAT SPECIFIC OFFENSES SUCH AS NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING OVER THREE POUNDS WAS COMMITTED. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO ESTABLISH NECESSITY. WHICH IS THAT OTHER TRADITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN TRIED. OR HAVE FAILED OR ARE NOT FEASIBLE. SO THE INITIAL APPLICATION FOR THE WIRE TAP IS ONLY FOCUSED ON CERTAIN SPECIFIC CRIMES HOWEVER. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT IN CONTROL OF WHAT. THE TARGETS TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW ONE MURDER SUSPECT COULD SUDDENLY START TALKING ABOUT NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING. THE CODE IS SET UP SO. IF THEY IF THE TARGET START TALKING ABOUT NON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. WE HAVE TO MINIMIZE THAT WE HAVE TO BASICALLY NOT LISTEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND IN FACT. THE MONITORING EQUIPMENT THAT IS USED. ONCE A CALL IS BEGINS WE INTERCEPTED HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH -- WITH THE OFFENSE AND THAT MONARCHY EQUIPMENT IS TURNED OFF. FIRST OF ALL THAT CALL IS NOT RECORDED ANYMORE SO IT ESSENTIALLY IS A RACIST IT. CANNOT BE OBTAINED IT'S NOT RECORDED ON THE ON THE LISTENING DEVICE. THE FACT THAT THE CALL IS MADE IS RECORDED SO WE DO KNOW THAT I CALLED DâN. HOWEVER WHAT DAN AND I TALKED ABOUT IS NOT ACTUALLY RECORDED. AND THE EQUIPMENT IS METERED SO SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION WE CAN SPOT CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE OFFICERS WHO WERE DOING THE MONITORING ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE LAW. AND FAILURE TO MINIMIZE. IS THE GROUND FOR SUPPRESSION SO THERE'S A LOT OF BUILT IN PROTECTIONS. FOR A DEFENDANT WHO. MAKES THE MOTION THAT HIS OR HER CONVERSATIONS WERE ILLEGALLY RECORDED. LIMIT LET ME FOLLOW UP I'M NOT SURE THAT FIGHTING ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION SO LET ME. LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. SO IT IN THE ORIGINAL BILL THERE WERE SIXTEEN SERIOUS OFFENSES THAT WERE LISTED WEEK WE'VE STE OF STRUCK. MOST OF THEM. BUT ONE OF THEM ITEM NUMBER FIVE HOLDING A HOSTAGE BY PERSON CONFIDE IN STATE PRISON. SO IF YOU HAVE A WIRE TAP THAT EXISTS. AND FOR A LEGITIMATE REASON AS WAS AUTHORIZED IN THE ORIGINAL STATUTE AND SOMEONE SAYS IN THE COURSE OF THAT OH BY THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HOLD A HOSTAGE. IN A STATE PRISON. ALL RIGHT THAT THAT CAN'T BE USED IN EVIDENCE IN AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEN THAT BECOMES -- OTHER OTHER EVIDENCES DERIVATIVE THAT IS THROUGH THE POISONOUS TREE. SO. TO TO YOUR POINT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE AND AND RUN. NOW FOR ME NOT THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ELIMINATION OF THAT BUT I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEES COULD. THE COMMITTEE'S VIEW AND THAT'S NO LONGER -- IN ENUMERATED -- ITEM THAT THAT CAN BE COLLECTED YES IT. THROUGH THE CHAIR. THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA LAW. WHEN YOU OVER HERE A? NON TARGETED CRIMINAL OFFENSE -- FOR SHIP TODAY THE THE SAID THE VIOLENT FELONY -- BEFORE JUST BECAUSE I HERE. THOUGH. JOHN DOE SAY THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO COMMIT A ROBBERY OR THEY'VE COMMITTED CERTAIN ROBBERIES -- I STILL CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY YOU [inaudible] THAT. AND HAVE TO GET THE PERMISSION OF THE COURT. SO. IF IT WAS FOR A NON TARGET A CHECK FROM [inaudible] THE ONE YOU'D HAVE TO GO. NOT USE THAT INFORMATION BUT AS THE SENATOR AND MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT. THERE'S THE PROTECTIONS IN THE EQUIPMENT SO THAT YOU CAN DETERMINE WHAT WAS TO LISTEN TO WHAT WAS NOT LISTEN. TO AND THEN EVEN IF I COME AWARE OF IT. I HAVE TO FIND OTHER EVIDENCE OUTSIDE OF THAT WATER. IN ORDER TO PROSECUTE THE CASE OTHERWISE ALL THAT WOULD GET SUPPRESSED IN THE CASE WILL BE DISMISSED. OKAY THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED ON BURKE -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD URGE AYE VOTE. AND AND I WANT TO THANK HIM STONE BURKE AT THE NOTE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE MEMBERS BUT THE CHAIR. THE REST COMMITTEE REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT -- SOMETIMES I WISH OTHER COLLEAGUES WOULD TAKE YOUR EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS COMMENDABLE AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO GET THIS OUT IS COMMITTEE IT IS TO FLOOR SO HE BEGAN. THIS PROCESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME REALLY ADMIRABLE PARTS OF THIS BILL THAT WE REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER AND SO GUY JUST PERSONALITY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND CHURCH RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. ON SB FOUR THIRTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY. BARRICADE HAND BACKHAND I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU MUCH. I MISS RUBIO ITEM NUMBER. FOUR SB TWO SEVEN THREE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MOVE THE BELL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS SENT TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB TWO SEVENTY THREE THE PHOENIX ACT. TWENTY FIRST THANK THE CHAIRMAN HAS COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH MY STAFF. FIVE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH INCLUDES SLOWING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO EIGHT YEARS. SB TWO SEVENTY THREE IS CRITICAL AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT WOULD EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO HEAL FROM THEIR TRAUMA. FEEL SAFE AWAY FROM THEIR ABUSERS [inaudible] SORRY. SB TWO SEVENTY THREE INCLUDES ADDITIONAL TRAINING. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CIRCUMSTANCES IN A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE MANNER. DATA SHOWS A MULTIPLE REASONS WHY SURVIVORS OF ABUSE MAY NOT COME FORWARD WITHIN THE STATURE LIMITATION INCLUDING. THEIR AGE AT THE TIME OF ABUSE ONGOING TRAUMA THREATS FROM THEIR PERPETRATOR FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A HORRIBLE CRIME THAT AFFLICTS A HEAVY TOLL ON ITS VICTIMS AND WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE STATISTICS ARE GRAHAM. MANY VICTIMS REPORT ONLY AFTER THEY LEARN THAT THEIR ABUSER IS ALREADY ABUSING SOMEONE ELSE. SOME COME FORWARD WITH VIDEO. AUDIO RECORDINGS AND FORDER GRAPHS. HOWEVER NOTHING COULD BE DONE BECAUSE THERE THREE YEARS ARE UP. IN AMERICA AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY WOMEN ARE SHOT TO DEATH BY THEIR ABUSERS. EVERY MONTH AND MANY MORE ARE INJURED. THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHEN I STORY BECAME PUBLIC IN THE MEDIA HUNDREDS OF WOMEN FELT COMPELLED TO TELL THEIR STORIES? AND SHARE THEIR PERSONAL TRAUMAS. THE ONE THING THEY ALL HAD IN COMMON WAS THAT. DEEP ROOTED TRAUMA AND PARALYZING FEAR. THAT TAKE THE MANY YEARS TO OVERCOME. AND MANY WERE NEVER ABLE TO TELL ANYONE EVEN AFTER THE RELATIONSHIP ENDED. ON AVERAGE NEARLY TWENTY PEOPLE PER MINUTE ARE VICTIMS OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER IN THE UNITED STATES. UNFORTUNATELY IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED THE ESCALATION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. CASES RESULT IN DEATH. TRAGICALLY WE JUST EXPERIENCE THE RECENT DEATH OF A YOUNG POLICE OFFICER. SOLOMON. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHO IS ANSWERING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL. THIS IS THE HEART OF THE BILL. VICTIMS NEVER KNOW IF THE ABUSE WILL ESCALATE TO MURDER EVEN AFTER THE RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDED. SO FEAR RUNS DEEP AND PUSHES VICTIMS AND TO SILENCE SOMETIMES FOREVER. AT TIMES ABUSES WILL END UP TAKING IT OUT ON THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR LOVED ONES. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN MY DISTRICT A FRIEND OF MINE DOWN I A STATUS. LOST HER FIVE YEAR OLD SON. WHO WE ON US PEAKING? ON A LEFT HER ABUSER. AND FOUGHT DESPERATELY TO GAIN. SOLE CUSTODY OF HER SON SHE FELT. PK BELIEVE THE DOW WAS TAKING HER TO DISNEYLAND. HER EX HUSBAND MURDERED HIM TO HURT HER. ANOTHER VICTIM WHO SPOKE AT A RECENT PRESS CONFERENCE TALKED ABOUT HOW HER EX PARTNER AMBUSHED HER. AND TERRORIZED HER AND HER FAMILY. HE STOCKED -- SO MUCH SO HE FOUND HER SHOT INTO HER HOME SHOOTING HER FATHER. AND HER WITH HER FOUR YEAR OLD SON WATCHING. IT'S THE BEST MORE REALITY. A FEAR THAT DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE VICTIMS FACE. AND IT PUSHES THEM. AND TO SILENCE.% AND THE SHAME CONTINUES FOR A LIFETIME. MEMBERS LET'S NOT MAKE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ONE MORE HURDLE THAT AND ALREADY BROKEN. TRAUMATIZED VICTIM HOUSE TO INDOOR. SOMETIMES IT TAKES YEARS BEFORE VICTIMS EVEN REALIZE WHAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING WAS ABUSE. ANOTHER VICTIM TESTIFIED THAT HER FIRST PUNCH HER FIRST CáC. WAS AT THIRTEEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. IT TOOK FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO HEAR FOR FEEL FROM THAT TRAUMA. IDENTIFY AS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD. NOW SHE HAS TO SEE HER ABUSER AROUND TOWN. AND THERE'S NOTHING SHE CAN DO TO REMEDY THAT. THIS IS WHY SB TWO SEVENTY THREE IS SO CRITICAL. WHEN THEY DO FIND THE COURAGE TO SEEK JUSTICE WE MUST ALLOW THEM TO DO SO? VICTIMS DESERVE THE TIME TO HEAL FIND THEIR VOICE AND MUSTER THE STRENGTH TO COME FORWARD. TODAY WITH ME I HAVE TWO COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS. FIRST ASK MAYBE UNCLE SURVIVOR AN ADVOCATE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. ALAIN WHITE FEATHER THE CEO OF A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE LOCAL SACRAMENTO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOCUSING ON TV'S. THANK YOU HAVE A TO TOGETHER YET FIVE MINUTES BUT WILL WORK WITH YOU GOOD. THE MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AS MAY BE ACKERMAN I'M A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SALIVA AND ADVOCATE. BEFORE HE SUCCEEDED IN HIS DEDUCTION MY ABUSE A CAREFULLY GROOMED ME MANIPULATING A GAS LIGHTING ME OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP. HE KNEW THE TIE WAS EASY PREY I HAD NEITHER POWER NOR CONTROLLER FOR MY LIFE. THE PREVIOUS INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH STREET NEAR BIRTH AND SO I WAS LED FROM THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE. INITIALLY HE WAS CHARMING INTELLIGENT FUNNY HE TOLD ME I WAS HIS SOULMATE. BY THE TIME I WAS LIVING WITH HIM HE CONTROLLED EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE. HE HAD THE DRESS CODE I WAS EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY HE CONTROLLED RETALIATES DECIDED IF MY FRIENDSHIPS WERE ACCEPTABLE WHEN I CALLED MY FAMILY I DO I DID SO HIDING INSIDE A CLOSET. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP THE HOUSE AND I WOULD OFTEN BE LOCKED IN THE BEDROOM. HE CONTROLLED WHEN AND IF I SLEPT AND I WAS OFTEN VIOLENTLY SHAKEN AWAKE SHOULD I GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT PERMISSION. VERBAL ABUSE OF NAME CALLING WAS A DAILY OCCURRENCE THE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IS MOST OFTEN DESCRIBED IN ACTS OF INTIMACY WAS NOT CONSENTED. TO IN ONE INSTANCE I WAS BITTEN INTO MY BODY WAS COVERED IN BRUISES ANOTHER OCCASION CUT WITH A KNIFE DURING SEX. HE TOOK PHOTOS OF MY NAKED MUTILATED BODY AND POSTED THEM ONLINE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. I STILL HAVE THESE PHOTOS ALONG WITH PHOTOS OF MY BODY COVERED IN WELTS INFLICTED WITH THE WHIP. ON ONE OCCASION AFTER FOUR DAYS MOSTLY P. BECAME VERY ANGRY WITH ME HE STARTED SMASHING HOLES IN THE WALLS WITH AN ACCENT AS I TRIED TO CALM HIM DOWN HE BEGAN TO CHASE AFTER ME WITH THE WEAPON. IT WAS AT THIS STAGE I REALIZED MY LIFE WAS IN DANGER. I WAS A PRISONER IN HIS HELL AND YET I THOUGHT I'D DONE SOMETHING TO DESERVE THIS SO I JUST TRIED HARDER TO PLEASE HIM. MY TRUMP HAD NORMALIZE THESE HORRIFIC EVENTS TO ENABLE ME TO SURVIVE. IT TOOK ME SEVEN YEARS TO GET TO STAY DRY COULD SEE THESE ACTS FOR WHAT THEY WERE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AFTER A DIAGNOSIS OF PTSD THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH I STILL SUFFER ON A DAILY BASIS. I START TO THEINCREDIBLY PAINFUL PROCESS OF HEALING FROM MY TRAUMA THE NIGHT TERRORS OF THE WORST PART I WAKE FROM THESE STREAMS SCREAMING CERTAINS WERE SWEPT MID PANIC ATTACK ONCE A PANIC SUBSIDES TO IS REPLACED WITH A CRIPPLING SHAME. THE SAME IS OVERWHELMING THE FOR THE TIME MIGHT SOMEHOW REPEAT PAST PATTERNS AND FIND MYSELF BACK IN THE CYCLE. WHEN I FINALLY FOUND THE COURAGE SEVEN YEARS LATE TO SEEK LEGAL ADVICE I WAS TOLD DESPITE HAVING PHOTOGRAPHIC VIDEO WHEN WRITTEN EVIDENCE IT WAS TOO LATE? NOTHING COULD BE DONE. SO I LIVE. SO I LIVE WITH THE DAILY KNOWLEDGE BY ABUSE IS STILL INFLICTING A REPAIRABLE DAMAGE ANOTHER WOMEN. THE PHOENIX AT GIVE SURVIVORS THE TIME THEY NEED TO BREAK THE CYCLE FOR BOTH THEMSELVES AND THEIR REFUSES. WHO WE KNOW STATISTICALLY MOST LIKELY CAUGHT COULD CONTINUE ABUSING IF LEFT UNCHECKED? I KNOW I WILL NEVER SEE JUSTICE FOR HAPPEN TO ME. BUT I AM HERE RISKING MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY. TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL GIVE THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS A CHANCE TO SEEK THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM ELAINE MY FEATHER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CEO OF A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE. A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR OF FAMILY VIOLENCE SURVIVOR. AND I HAVE PROVIDED TV ADVOCACY FOR OVER THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. WHEN SOMEONE DECIDES TO THREATEN STOCK HARASS OR ABUSE HIS OR HER PARTNER? WHAT MIGHT A VICTIM DO? THE ANSWER SEEMS OBVIOUS TO MANY OF US TELL SOMEONE TELL A FAMILY MEMBER A GOOD FRIEND A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATE OR POLICE. SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU. EXCEPT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OVER AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE FOR MARGINALIZED VICTIMS OF COLOR WHY? THE FIRST BARRIER IS THE VERY TRAUMA ITSELF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IPV AFFECTS ONE IN FOUR WOMEN ONE IN SEVEN MEN. IT IS 3250% HIGHER IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND 60% HIGHER IN MARGINALIZED LGBT Q. AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES. IT IS A SOCIETAL ISSUE ROOTED IN GENDER BASED VIOLENCE FOR GENERATIONS AN ISSUE OF POWER AND CONTROL WITH MANY FORMS OF ABUSES USED TO MAINTAIN THAT CONTROL. AND IT'S ONLY BEEN CRIMINALIZED SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE IMPACT OF THIS BEHAVIORAL CRIME IS THE COMPLEX TRAUMA THAT VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS INDOOR AND AFFECTS THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN FOR A LIFETIME. CRIME VICTIMS OF ALL TYPES OF CRIME MAY EXPERIENCE TRAUMA. PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THEIR BODIES OR EMOTIONAL WOUNDS OR SHOCKED BECAUSE MY VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM. REACTION TO TRAUMA VARIES FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND CAN LAST FOR HOURS DAYS WEEKS MONTHS. OR YEARS. VICTIMS MAY EXPERIENCE PHYSICAL TRAUMA FROM A SERIOUS INJURY OR SHOT TO THE BODY. AND THEY MAY HAVE CUTS BRUISES FRACTURED ARMS LEGS OR INTERNAL INJURIES. VICTIMS MAY I X. EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA EMOTIONAL WOUNDS ARE SHOCKED THAT A LONG LASTING EFFECTS. EMOTIONAL TRAUMA MAY TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS SHOCK OR NUMBNESS FEELING FROZEN AND CUT OFF FROM YOUR OWN EMOTIONS. VICTIMS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS OR CONDUCT THEIR LIVES AS THEY DID ONCE BEFORE THE CRIME. TRAUMATIC MEMORIES ARE HARSH AND FROZEN IMPRINTS THESE FROZEN IMPRINTS MUST BE THAWED AND ENVIRONMENT OF SAFETY. BEFORE THEY CAN BE TOLD. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DO NOT EASILY FEEL SAFE ANYWHERE. IT THAT IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO ESCAPE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND MANY MORE TO FINALLY FEEL. SKEWS ME FEEL SAFE ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT IT. EVEN WHEN VICTIMS DO BEGIN TO TELL THEIR STORY THE THOUGHTS OF PAST ABUSE MAY SHUT DOWN THE FRONTAL LOBE OF THE BRAIN. THIS VERY PART OF THE BRAIN IS WHAT WE NEED TO PUT OUR FEELINGS INTO WORDS. WHEN THE FRONTAL LOBES SETS DOWN THE IMPRINTS OF TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES ARE NOT ORGANIZED AS COHERENT LEGAL NARRATIVES LOGICAL NARRATIVES? BUT IN FRAGMENTED SENSORY EMOTIONAL TRACES IMAGES SOUNDS AND PHYSICAL SENSATIONS. ADDITIONALLY WHEN VICTIMS DO NOT RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND HELP THEY NEED AFTER THE CRIME THEY MAY SUFFER SECONDARY INJURIES. THEY MAY BE HURT BY A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING FROM FRIENDS FAMILY AND THE PROFESSIONALS THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH. PARTICULARLY IF OTHERS SEEM TO BLAME THE VICTIM FOR THE CRIME SUGGESTING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT IT OR AVOID IT. BASED ON NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF ADVOCATES ATTORNEY SERVICE PROVIDERS A NONPROFIT WORKERS WHO SUPPORT AND REPRESENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS. 88% OF THE RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT POLICE SOMETIMES OR OFTEN DO NOT BELIEVE VICTIMS OR BLAME VICTIMS FOR THE VIOLENCE. WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS BILL IS VERY HELPFUL AND WILL ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. WOMEN OF ALL RACES AND ETHNICITIES WEAPON DOOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AT SOME POINT IN TIME TO STAY OR LEAVE THE ABUSERS. FOR MANY WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY BACKGROUND AND LGBT Q. THE FIRST RESPONSE IS OFTEN TO NOT REPORT. NOT TELL ANYONE WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR PARTNERS IT IS NOT EASY TO TURN THEM OVER TO THE POLICE THE COURTS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY BY US. PEOPLE WITH IMMIGRANT STATUS MAY FEAR BEING DEPORTED IF THEY LACK DOCUMENTATION. EXTENDING THE LIMITATIONS TO THE MAXIMUM YOU WILL ALLOW IS A TRAUMA INFORMED PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT SUPPORTS BOTH THE VICTIM SURVIVOR AND THE FIRST RESPONDER. THE SURVIVOR WILL GET TIME TO HEAL ACCESS HELP AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FEAR AND STRESS OF ESCAPING THE TEAR. BEFORE. RE EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA OF REPORTING AND THE PROCESS OF SEEKING JUSTICE BEFORE HE SHE OR THEY ARE READY. FAILURE IS A MEMORY THAT LEAD TO NOT BE BELIEVED OR WORSE VICTIM BLAMING SELF BLAME TREAT TRIGGERS THE FEAR OF RETRIBUTION BY THE ABUSER. BECAUSE NO CONSEQUENCES WERE GIVEN FOR THE DVD CRIME OF TV AND I PAVE A THIS IS WHAT IMPACT SURVIVORS OF TV THE MOST. NOT BEING BELIEVED NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD. AND MANY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES DO NOT EVEN KNOW IT'S A CRIME. THE TRAINING PIECE OF THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE FOR TOM INFORM TRAINING TO REDUCE THESE BARRIERS AND INCREASE THE OVERALL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS FOR OFFICER RESPONSE. TRAINING BEYOND ACADEMY AND POST TRAINING THAT ENGAGES EXPERT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SERVICE PROVIDERS THERE ARE WELL OVER A DOMINANT CULTURE AND CULTURALLY SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR STATE. WE WILL ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL BARRIER THAT EXISTS WITH WITH WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE TRAUMA OF TV. THESE COLLABORATIONS WILL INCREASE THE OVERALL INTERVIEWING AND FOLLOW UP THE COOPERATION OF THE SURVIVOR. WHEN SUPPORTED BY CONSULTATION AND COLLABORATION WITH TV EXPERT ORGANIZATIONS? THIS IS TRUE ESPECIALLY WHEN RESPONDING TO SURVIVORS OF COLOR. OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES LIKE LGBT Q. IMMIGRANTS NON ENGLISH SPEAKING AND MALE VICTIMS. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE TIME AND SUPPORTS THE VICTIMS SURVIVORS ABILITY TO HEAL. AND CHOOSE TO REPORT FILE CHARGES AND GET THE JUSTICE HE OR SHE OR THEY SEE. IT IS TRAUMA INFORMED SOCIAL JUSTICE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON CAP KEY MCCUE CAP CAN% ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. SURE MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THIS GERMAN MEMBERS STAND FLOWS OUT OF THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS ACTUAL LICENSE SUPPORT. SHAVE RECORD CLASS. FOR THE WITNESS WHO SPOKE LAST TIME AND I'M VERY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I'M MORE QUICK ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. MY NAME IS ALVIN OLIVER IS. SACRAMENTO LEGAL ADVOCATE IN A SUPPORT THIS BILL. I'M ACTUALLY GORE RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA AND A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. MY NAME IS PRINCE RAHMAN I'M A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. MY NAME IS A SILLY HOW ON BEHALF OF SURVIVOR LINES WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. MY NAME IS BENNY OF LOS AND SURVIVOR OF A GUNSHOT -- POLICE INCOMPETENCE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I'M HERE BECAUSE I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB TWO SEVENTY THREE UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF PROMOTING JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. HOWEVER WE FEAR THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL EVEN TAKE EIGHT YEARS MOBILE THREATEN DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS AND REMOVE THE INCENTIVE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS. TO MORE SWIFTLY ADDRESSED REPORTS OF DOMESTIC PLANT PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS HELP TO ENSURE THAT DEFENDANTS RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL. AS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS STATED STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS PROTECT INDIVIDUALS FROM HAVING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST CHARGES WHEN THE BASIC FACTS MAY HAVE BECOME OBSCURED BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME. THESE ISSUES SURROUNDING TIME PASSAGE AND FACTS -- APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION DEFENDANTS DETECTIVES WITNESSES AND VICTIMS ALIKE AND AS SUCH BOTH DEFENDANT AND VICTIM MAY SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. OF THESE DEFICITS OFTEN LEADING TO UNJUST OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO ENSURING FAIRNESS. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS ALSO NOTED THAT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ENCOURAGE THE SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW HOPEFULLY PRODUCING A STRONGER DETERRENT EFFECT. AS YOU HAVE HEARD SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS CRIMINAL THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN A STATEWIDE STUDIED MORE THAN INVOLVING AGGRAVATED PHYSICAL ASSAULT WERE NOT PROSECUTED. OTHER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHILE POLICE TEAM JUST A FRACTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION. PROSECUTORS HAVE APPROACHED SUSPICIOUSLY EVEN THOSE CASES THAT POLICE DEEMED TO HAVE THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN THESE CASES WILL NOT IMPROVE THESE OUTCOMES. AND MAY SERVE ONLY TO FURTHER DISCOURAGE THE SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. THERE BY WEAKENING THE THREAT OF PROSECUTION FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIMES. SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ARE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE EXTENSION TO THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER OCT ROTH FOR THE ACLU BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION AGREES. THAT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A PLAGUE THAT AFFECTS EVERY CLASS AND RACE IN THIS SOCIETY. AND I HAVE REPRESENTED PERSONALLY A NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO HAVE FOUGHT BACK AGAINST THE MEN WHO ABUSE THEM I REPRESENTED ONE WOMAN. WHO SHOT HER ABUSER IN THE LEG? AND SHE WAS PROSECUTED. I REPRESENTED ANOTHER WOMAN WHO -- HAD KILLED HER ABUSER AND THEN -- AND AND FACED ABUSE FROM A SECOND MAN. AND POURED BOILING WATER ON HIM. I AGREE THE POLICE NEED TO BE TRAINED. BUT I THINK WHAT'S MORE -- IMPORTANT. AND WHERE WE SHOULD PUT OUR RESOURCES IS NOT BEEN EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. NOT IN ON HIM AND JAILING MORE PEOPLE BUT THIS IN PROVIDING RESOURCES. FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND MEN WHO ARE ABUSED. AND PART OF THE PROGRAM THE THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO WORK. M. IN THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE WORLDWIDE. IS TO START IN SCHOOL. AND THE CENTER -- FOR FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES CDC HAS SUCH A PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE -- ACTUALLY TRIED OUT IN OAKLAND. AND IN OTHERS -- CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT STARTING WITH CHILDREN AND EDUCATING THEM ABOUT ONE THAT YOU DON'T RESORT TO BIND. IS THE FIRST STEP. IN ENDING THIS PLAGUE SO FOR THOSE REASONS THE A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR REBEKAH POWER QUE AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK MS BIANCO AND SENATOR RUBIO FOR BEING HERE AND GIVING VOICE TO THE MANY VICTIMS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP TODAY. AND HAS A TASTE FOR WORDS THE PROPONENTS MOUTHS BUT I THINK THAT THE EDUCATION THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING -- IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THEY WOULD ALSO SUPPORT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND NOT LASTS AND SO IT SHOULD BE AN EITHER OR AND THAT MEANS GIVING. THESE VICTIMS A CHANCE TO GET JUSTICE IT MEANS PREVENTING VIOLENCE SET POSSIBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THEY ENTER THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY'RE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY THE RESPECT AND SECURITY THAT THEY NEED. TO GET THE JUSTICE THEYDESERVE SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YES I WANT TO THANK. THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR THAT PERSISTENT ADVOCACY -- YOU KNOW. WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT SORT OF SEXUAL OFFENSE IT JUST CAME UP AND KIND OF DE STIGMATIZING. WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND WE DON'T REALLY FRAME IT IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR FOLKS TO HAVE EQUITABLE CONVERSATIONS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN -- AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST CERTAIN KINDS OF WOMEN. I WOULD HOPE THAT -- THE AUTHOR IN THE ADVOCATES CAN RESPOND TO MY QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE ANALYSIS -- IS LEGITIMATE -- AND I'M GONNA SHARE THE QUESTION FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OFTENTIMES WHAT WE LIKE TO DO IS WE DISCOUNT SOMEONEELSE'S EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT OUR OWN. AND SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL EXPERIENCES BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. SO -- MAYHEM ASSAULT BATTERY MURDER MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SHARED IN THE TESTIMONY ARE ALREADY CHARGEABLE OFFENSES AND IF THEY ARE NOT. THE NOT THE CONVERSATION THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT WHY WE DO NOT SEE VALUE IN THAT VICTIM COMING FORWARD. BECAUSE EITHER THEY'RE DEAD OR BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN HURT -- AND THAT THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR IS NOT CHARGED. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT. PEOPLE DO LIKE. REVENGE. AND PEOPLE DO LIKE TO RETALIATE AND THERE ARE INSTANCES DIVORCE. ADD SEPARATION THAT ARE NOT AMICABLE. WHERE FOLKS ARE LOOKING FOR THEIR POUND OF FLESH? AND MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE PROTECT. AGAINST THOSE SITUATIONS FROM HAPPENING FROM SOMEONE SAYING HEY BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE EXTENDED THE STATUTE OF LIBERTY LIMITATIONS. AND I HAD A LESS THAN DESIRABLE. EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PERSON I'M GOING TO USE THIS LAW. TO SEEK THAT KIND OF A RANGE I ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME. IT HAPPENED TO ME -- AND I AM CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO AFFORD SOMEONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE. TO SEEK WAYS TO TRAUMATIZE ME AND THOSE WAYS YES AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS TO SEE HOW WE CAN BOTH PROTECT. TRUE LEGITIMATE VICTIMS -- OF THESE KINDS OF ASSAULT. WHILE STILL SORT OF PROTECTING AGAINST SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THAT WAS -- ATTEMPTED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS -- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT IN BE IT'S VERY PERSONAL. I'LL START OUT WELL THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT QUESTION AND I DO SHOW YOUR CONCERN -- AND I'M SENSITIVE TO TO THAT ISSUE AND THAT IS WHY THIS BILL REQUIRES -- THAT IT'S EVIDENCE BASED. THAT WHEN THEY DO COME FORWARD -- THERE HAS TO BE EVENTS SUCH AS VIDEO AUDIO -- AS WE HEARD FROM -- THE TESTIMONY EVEN WITH THE AUDIO VIDEO OF THREATS OP SHE WASN'T ABLE TO BRING HER ABUSER TO JUSTICE SO THERE IS A COMPONENT THAT WAS THAT IT. THAT MAKES IT EVIDENCE BASED VERSUS JUST SOMEONE ACCUSING SOMEONE AND JESSE SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS IN THERE. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THERE'S A COUPLE WAYS THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST OF ALL JUST IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AND WORKING WITH WOMEN WHO ACTUALLY. I HAVE BEEN IN PRISON FOR KILLING THEIR ABUSER. WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO THAT IS THAT THAT IS OFTEN THE VERY LAST OPTION FOR ANY SURVIVOR AND USUALLY BECAUSE SYSTEMS HAVE FAILED HER REPEATEDLY AGAIN AND AGAIN? SO THAT'S ONE SIDE OF IT AND A SMALL PIECE BUT WE CAN LOOK INTO ALL THE DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT PARTICULAR -- STATEMENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND BECAUSE THIS IS NOW THE FOURTH FIFTH SIXTH GENERATION OF VIOLENCE IN OUR FAMILIES. WHICH IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR AND SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS LEARNED AND WE LIVE IN A VIOLENT VIOLENT COMMUNITY LIFELINE. WORLD WHERE POWER AND CONTROL IN THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO CONTROL SOMEONE OR TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IS ALSO SYSTEMIC. SO WHAT WE'RE ALSO UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AGGRESSOR. AND A DOMINANT AGGRESSOR TRAIN IS WHAT REQUIRES THAT ALL OF US IN OUR FIELD AND THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FIELD. AS IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE UNDERSTAND MORE MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA TO THE BRAIN. UNDERSTAND WHAT AN INJURY IN DOMESTIC BONDS ACTUALLY DOES DUE TO A VICTIM. WE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COERCIVE CONTROL AND PRIMARY DOMINANT AGGRESSOR AND SO WHEN YOU START TO TRAIN THE SALON FOR MEANT. THAT WE AS ADVOCATES WE CAN BE CONSULTANTS COLLABORATE WITH THESE THINGS FIRST OF ALL YOU ELIMINATE THAT REVENGE PIECE WHICH I AGREE. I AGREE AND SUPPORT YOU WITH THAT THAT THAT IS PRESENT BUT THERE IS A WAY TO FILTER THAT OUT TO BE ABLE TO SAY FROM OUR EXPERT POINT OF VIEW WHAT IS A TRUE. VICTIM RESPONSE AND REACTION. VERSUS WHAT IS A PRIMARY DOMINANT POWER AND CONTROL USE OF ABUSE. DEBT TO TO GET THE EXACT EVENTS OR HAVE POWER AND CONTROL OVER SOMEONE INDEFINITELY THERE IS THAT IT'S AN EDUCATIONAL PIECE THAT. TRAUMA SURVIVORS LIKE AS AND D. V. D. V. EXPERTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY WHEN WE DO LEGAL WORK WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO FILL OUT AN RO. OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR SURVIVORS WE HAVE TO SIFT THROUGH THAT TOO AS ADVOCATES IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING FOR OUR MOVEMENT BUT IT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW. SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN THIS THIS FIELD OF EDUCATING OURSELVES AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE JUSTICE YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THIS PIECE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST A CRIME IT'S BEHAVIORAL IT'S LEARNED AND GENERATIONAL. AND ITS HISTORICAL AND IF WE DON'T TAKE ALL OF THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. WHAT THIS WHAT EVEN ARE MY THE THE RESPECTFUL OFFICES BY POSITION I CAN CONCUR WITH MANY ELEMENTS OF WHAT THEY SAID? BUT HERE'S THE THING 450% OF SURVIVORS WHO DON'T EVEN REPORT IT TO BEGIN WITH IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS THAT DON'T EVEN LET US GO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO HOW MANY OF US ARE TOLD DON'T EVEN CALL THE COPS. THAT IS WHAT WILL GET YOU THE WORST BEATING OF YOUR LIFE. DON'T EVEN REPORTED TO ANYONE THAT WILL YOUR DIPPY TRAIN YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR BILL TO BE TRAINED YEAR. YOUR YOUR RELIGION YOU'RE BETRAYING ALL OF THESE PIECES SO THAT'S KEEPING US TRAPPED WE NEED TIME TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THOSE PIECES. AND AN ADVOCATE AND THE VICTIM CAN NEVER EVER STAND FOR HERSELF ABOUT THAT HELP. THANK YOU RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] MR LACKEY. YEAH CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SO. TO THE FOREFRONT HERE TODAY -- AND WITNESSES THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONIES. YOU KNOW THIS -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES I THINK ONE OF OUR THE BIGGEST. TOXINS TO OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY. AND IT'S QUITE COMPLEX. BUT THIS IS JUST ONE VERY PIVOTAL TOOL VERY POWERFUL TOOL. IN ALLOWING REMEDY TO TAKE PLACE AND I THINK EVEN PREVENTION. BECAUSE I I THINK THE GOAL WOULD BE. I MEAN THE MOST IDEAL SITUATION IS PREVENTION BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW IN REALITY THAT THAT IS NOT. POSSIBLE IN EVERY CASE. IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN. SO WE NEED TOOLS WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN. TO SUPPORT VICTIMS. VICTIMS ARE THE ONES THAT DESERVE THE SUPPORT AND WE NEED. TO TRY TO HELP THE PEOPLE HAVE THE PROBLEMS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. AND THE PERSON WHO DESERVES THE MOST SUPPORT IS THE VICTIM. AND SO I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR THIS PARTICULAR TOOL IT'S ALARMING TO ME THAT YOU EVEN HAVE TO BRING THIS FORWARD. IT IT IT SHOCKS THE CONSCIENCE. THAT WE HAVE. THIS LIMIT TO REPORT WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A SOCIETY WHEN WE HI SHOULD PROTECT THOSE WHO HAVE NO. DESERVES CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT REGARD IS SHAMEFUL. AND IN MY OPINION IT SHAMEFUL THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS -- BECAUSE IT'S INSENSITIVE TO THOSE WHO TRULY NEED. THIS AVENUE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM. AND HOPEFULLY STOP IT TOO FROM CONTINUING AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THIS IS EXTREMELY [inaudible] VOLATILE. AND VERY VERY TOXIC PROBLEM THAT -- ABUSERS CARRY WITH THEM. AND SO THANK YOU. FROM THE BOTTOM MY HEART I'M VERY VERY THANKFUL AND I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. A REQUEST ON RECORD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. AND TO TO BE A A PERSON TO ADVOCATE IN ANY WAY I CAN FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE. YES SOUTH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A FOR HEARING US HERE TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT ARE OPPOSITION TO STATED -- IT IT REALLY HITS HARD WHEN I HEAR -- AND THEIR WORDS IT THREATENS DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS. BUT I DID NOT HEAR VICTIMS RIGHTS AND I BELIEVE MR LACKEY SAID IT BEST THIS IS NOT ABOUT. US BECAUSE OUR TIME IS UP IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE NEXT GENERATION OF VICTIMS WERE PROBABLY CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A WE DID. AND THEY ALSO CITED [inaudible] DEFICIENT MEMORY. IN EIGHT YEARS I CAN ASSURE YOU WE REMEMBER EVERY PUNCH EVERY CáC EVERY ASSAULT. AND THEY ALSO CITED THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT TALKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AND WHY THEY'RE THERE BUT WE HAVE EVOLVED AS A SOCIETY. JUST LAST YEAR I BELIEVE WE REMOVE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE RESEARCH KEEPS SHOWING. THAT TRAUMA CAUSES WOMEN TO TO GOING TO THE SHUTTLE'S. MORE AND MORE -- INFORMATION'S COMING OUT THAT STATES THAT WOMEN NEED THAT TIME TO FEEL SAFE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT SAFETY I WHICH FATHER WAS SHOT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. AND SO I I DO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK IT IS TIME. THREE YEARS IN AN ALREADY COMPLICATED OBSTACLE COURSE. IS NOT ENOUGH. THREE YEARS IS JUST ENOUGH TO GET AWAY AND FEEL SAFE AND THEN IT TAKES THREE FOUR MORE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT'S OKAY TO SPEAK UP. AND SO I WANT TO THINK AS ME AND DOM AND MISS WHITE FEATHER FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE PERSONAL STORIES THAT NO ONE TELLS AND IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. WHO IS IN THE PUBLIC EYE TO SHARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS FOR ME? I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH HARDER IT WAS FOR HER AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I BY TWO IS CHAIRMAN OF THANK BOTH -- THE WITNESSES FOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY ARE NOT ONLY WERE YEAR. TESTIMONY COMPELLING -- IT REALLY KINDA EXEMPLIFY WHAT WHAT IS GOING ON IT. AND I THINK THE AUTHORAND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR TAKING. A DE AMENDMENTS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT -- LOOK I I KNOW. I PERSONALLY KNOW. OF A A YOUNG BOY AND AND IS AND A SISTER WHO WITNESSED THE MOTHER B. AND B.. AND I FIVE YEARS -- PULLING HIS. HIS FATHER OFF OF HIS MOTHER. EVEN TAKING PICTURES WITH A POLAROID CAMERA AND YOU SEE THE MOTHER WITH TWO BLACK EYES BUT THE KIDS WITH THEM. WHICH ALSO SHOWS HOUSE INSTITUTIONALIZED -- AND THEN. NOT SEEN THEIR FATHER FOR TWENTY YEARS. HI FATHER HAPPY CHILD SUPPORT ANYTHING. BUT BEEN SEEN A FATHER TWENTY YEARS LATER THAT THAT YOUNG BOY MET HIS FATHER. WHO HAD BEEN IT WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON? AND THIS IS KIND OF PART OF THE DAY IT. WHAT WHAT PEOPLE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON -- THAT'S WHY TWENTY WAS A LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR STATURE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE THAT PERSON WAS NO LONGER AN ALCOHOLIC PERSON WAS A CHRISTIAN. THE PERSON WOULD NO LONGER THAT SAME PERSON. AND THAT BOY DECIDED THAT HE WOULD. TRY NOT TO CONTINUE TO HATE THAT BOTHER FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS -- BUT TRY TO GET TO KNOWN FOR THE NEXT -- TWENTY WHICH KIND OF WORKED OUT FOR HIM -- AND THEN WHEN. AND THEN WHEN MY FATHER ASKED ME WHY I WASN'T ANGRY WITH HIM. AND I TOLD HIM THAT MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME HOW TO FORGIVE. AND TO SEE A GROWN MAN CRY IN FRONT OF YOU. BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID -- IT ALSO SHOWED ME THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE OTHER PART. FOR MEN. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRAINED. TO BE A DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE ABUSER. BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I FIRST SAW IT FIVE YEARS OLD HOW TO INTERACT. WITH A WIFE FOR SPOUSE SO THAT'S WHY. CENTER RUBIO I KEPT TALKING ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO. ONE GET THESE INDIVIDUALS. OUT OF THAT SITUATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK WE PROVIDE ENOUGH -- PROTECTION PROVIDING OF HOUSING WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH MONEY RESOURCES SO THAT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PEOPLE ARE IN THAT SITUATION CAN GET OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN PROVIDING. ENOUGH. MONEY RESOURCES SHELTER IN JOB TRAINING SO THEY CAN MOVE AWAY FROM THAT MY MOTHER HAD THE COURAGE TO GET OUT OF IT. AND AND AND AND I WILL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL FOR THAT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SIT. AND WAIT FOR THAT PERSON TO COME HOME. THAT NOT. IN YOUR STOMACH COULD YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO RUN LIKE A VOLCANO. OR NOT. I KNOW IT'S LIKE DELAY IN YOUR BED WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO GO ON IS NOT A GOOD FEELING. IS REALLY NOT MY SISTER TODAY I THINK MENTALLY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. WITH ANY MAIL BECAUSE OF THAT -- WITH A LITTLE -- MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SURE I MOVE I NEVER BECOME. WHAT MY FATHER WAS? BUT IT'S BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF HELP -- AND I KNOW I CAN. LIKE A VOLCANO VERBALLY BY THINK I LEARNED THAT FROM MY FATHER SO I'VE LEARNED AS Y. TALKIN MEASURED. TONES WHEN I GET ANGRY. I'VE HAD TO TEACH MYSELF NOT TO BE THAT PERSON. AND SO -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE MEN'S BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT. WHETHER IT'S TWENTY YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS CAN YOU -- TO TRY TO GIVE ENOUGH TIME SO THAT FOR FOR ME THIS IS ALSO PART OF HEALING. COULD YOU MAYBE CHILDREN INVOLVED THIS FAMILIES INVOLVED. THEY MAY NOT EVER COME BACK TOGETHER. BUT THEY MAY AFTER RAISING CHILDREN TOGETHER. AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE MOST SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND SO. BACK TO THE OPPONENTS THE I WAS WILLING TO TO RAISE IT BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT WE NEED TO GET MORE TIME MANY BECAUSE WE DON'T PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES RIGHT NOW TO DO ALL THAT WE NEED TO DO. AND SO I THINK WE'RE ALL IN IT WE'RE ALL AGREEING. ON ON THE STATUES LIMITATION -- THAT'S WHY I WENT DOWN FROM. TWENTY WEST WITH FROM UNLIMITED DOWN A TWENTY DOWN TO WHERE WE ARE SO WE MADE. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK CENTER RUBIO E'VE MADE SOME TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN AND AND SHORTENING THE TIME SO THAT MEMORIES. AND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE THAT AND SO I WILL NOT ONLY SUPPORT THIS. BUT IF THERE'S ANY SUBSEQUENT FUNDING OR IDEAS. THAT WE CAN DO. TO HELP WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- AND AND AND REALLY HELP THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THAT -- FOR BOTH SIDES MALE AND FEMALE SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN IN DISCOURAGE ONCE AND FOR ALL WE'RE NOT ATTACKING THE PROBLEM. AND WE KEEP. KEEP READING MORE MORE THESE ABUSERS. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STOP THAT. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASH -- FOR MICHAEL.

DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE OF QUIRK SANTIAGO. WICKS HI WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR PORTANTINO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB [inaudible] SEVEN THREE SEVEN SIX PORTANTINO FIREARMS TRANSFER CHAIRMAN. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER KALRA SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SB. THREE SEVEN SIX WOULD REDEFINE THE WORD INFREQUENT. TO ME IN LESS THAN SIX FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS. PER CALENDAR YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM FOR INDIVIDUALS TO SELL LEASE OR TRANSFER FIREARMS WITHOUT LEGALLY BEING REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE. THERE'S A DISPARITY IN THE PENAL CODES DEFINITION OF THE TERM AND FREQUENT. WHICH RESULTS IN A DISPARITY IN THE WAY IN WHICH I'M LICENSED SELLERS OF FIREARMS ARE TREATED UNDER THE LAW. INDIVIDUALS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO SELL FIREARMS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FIREARM BEING TRANSACTED. IN SOME INSTANCES THIS MAKES THEM -- FOR EXAMPLE NON PROFITS FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH A LICENSED DEALER WHEN ROUGHLY ARE AUCTIONING OFF A FIREARM. THE DISPARATE TREATMENT CAUSES CONFUSION A MAKES UNCLEAR IF AND WHEN SELLERS ARE REQUIRED TO AND SHOULD OBTAIN A LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRANSACTING FIREARMS. THIS IS A PROBLEM BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF A BRIGHT LINE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO STANDARDIZE THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM INFREQUENT IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND NUMBER OF FIREARMS. AN SINCE WHICH MAKES SENSE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A LOOPHOLE WHERE PEOPLE CAN SELL MORE GUNS THAN THEY SHOULD. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BILL WOULD CREATE A SINGLE LIMIT FOR THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS AND I'M LICENSE INDIVIDUAL IS AFFORDED ANY YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM. BEING TRANSACTED THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHERE TRANSACTIONS MAY BE A MIXTURE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF FIREARMS THE BILL WOULD ALSO LIMIT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FIREARMS INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO SELL. LEASE FOR TRANSFER TO NO MORE THAN FIFTY PER YEAR WITHOUT HAVING TO OBTAIN A LICENSE AND WITH ONLY UP TO FIVE SEPARATE. TRANSACTIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS BE REQUIRED TO ATTAIN A LICENSE IF THEY ARE SELLING LEASING TRANSFERRING OR MANUFACTURING MORE THAN FIFTY FIREARMS YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF FIREARM. CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE STATE FIRST STATE INSTITUTE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THESE CONNECTICUT RETURN REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL SELLING MORE THAN TEN HANDGUNS TO GET A LICENSE MASSACHUSETTS -- GENERALLY REQUIRES AND EVEN INDIVIDUAL SUMMING UP OR LEASING A FIREARM TO OBTAIN A LICENSE TROOP -- THOUGH DOES DOES PROVIDE FOR SOME EXEMPTIONS TODAY I HAVE ACTUALLY IRES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. AND YOU SEE THAT I'VE BEEN JOINED ALSO BY -- NGUYEN -- AND IRWIN TELLS TO BE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS FOR PUBLICATION BUT WE NEED TO GIVE HIM A SHOUT OUT. THAT -- HE'S FINALLY GOING TO GO THROUGH ON HIS -- THREATEN RETIREMENT AND HE SAYS THIS MAY BE THE VERY LAST TIME. HE'S HERE BEFORE THIS COMPOSITE VICIOUS COMMITTEE AS A SENATE STAFFER AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND I DON'T SEE MISTER PAGAN HERE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE WORK THAT ARE ONE IS DONE FOR GUN SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS MAY BE IS VERY LAST APPEARANCE BEFORE YOU MISTER CHAIR SO DO WITH IT AND THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU WILL AND WITH THAT I HAVE MY EXPERTS TO TESTIFY OKAY THANK YOU. MY GOODNESS SO MUCH PRESSURE ONES LAST HEARING. OUR HOME WE HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LIKE TO THANK SENATOR PORTANTINO FOR OFFERINGS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. AS SEEN IN RECENTLY PUBLISHED A TWO PART ARTICLE SERIES THAT DEMONSTRATES THE NEED IN THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL. THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE UNREGULATED SALE OF FIREARMS FOUND THAT UNLICENSED DEALERS FOUGHT THE NATION'S GUN LAWS PROVIDE A STEADY FLOW OF WEAPONS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER BARRED FROM OWNING GUNS OR WAN GUNS I CANNOT BE TRACED BACK TO THEM. I'M LICENSE DEALERS ARE DIFFICULT TO DETECT TOUGH TO PROSECUTE IN OFTEN RECEIVE LENIENT SENTENCES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE CONVICTED ACCORDING TO INTERVIEWS WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN CURRENT AND FORMER FEDERAL AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SEEN IN REVIEW DOESN'T THE CASES OF ILLEGAL DEALING INCLUDE SOME OF WHAT'S ALREADY FOR WARRANT BY A TF THAT THEY MIGHT BE BREAKING THE LAW. THE CONTINUED SELLING FIREARMS NONETHELESS GUNS THAT PASSED THROUGH THE HANDS OF UNLICENSED DEALERS HAVE TURNED UP AT CRIME SCENES AND IN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS FROM COAST TO COAST. INCLUDING IN CASES OF ARMED ROBBERY CARJACKING AND MURDER. THE SERIES DISCUSSES THE FIREARMS PROTECT FIREARMS OWNERS PROTECTION ACT A DECADES OLD FEDERAL STATUTE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION DICTATING WHO WAS REQUIRED TO HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL GUNS. AND WHO IS NOT. THE LAWS FUZZINESS ON THAT DISTINCTION IT PROVISION THE DEFENDANT WAS WILLFULLY VIOLATE THE LAW IN ORDER TO FACE PROSECUTION HAS FRUSTRATED EFFORTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM OF UNLICENSED GUN DEALING IN AMERICA. UNLICENSED GUN DEALERS ARE THE GO TO SOURCE OF FIRE AND FOR CRIMINALS AND OTHERS YOU CAN'T PASS SORT OF REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT LICENSED DEALERS ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM. ORDINARY CITIZENS WHO DECIDE TO SELL WEAPON OR WEAPONS BUT DO NOT FIT THE DEFINITION OF DEALER FACE NO REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT LAW ACCORDING TO CRITICS AS WHAT CONSTITUTES A DEALER ISN'T ALWAYS VERY CLEAR CUT. THE STATUTE SAYS THAT ANYONE WHO IS ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING A FIREARM REQUIRES A LICENSE TO ENGAGE IN THE BUSINESS COULD BE IN. DEVOTING TIME ATTENTION LABOR TO DEVOTE TO DEALING A FIRE INTO THE REGULAR COURSE OF TRADER BUSINESS WITH THE PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVE OF LIVELY HIDDEN PROFIT TO THE REPETITIVE PURCHASING RESELL FIREARMS. LAW STATES THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO SOMEONE ENGAGED IN ONLY OCCASIONAL GUN CELLS ARE COLLECTORS ARE HOBBIES ARE ADDING TO OUR SELLING FROM THEIR PERSONAL COLLECTIONS. ON THE WEST COAST ONE OF THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AND THE CASE WAS A DOZEN FIREARMS ALL BY THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY IN THE WASHINGTON STATE TURNING UP AT CRIME SCENES IN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS SCATTERED AROUND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. EACH THE FAMILY MEMBERS WERE CHARGED WITH FELONY I'M LICENSED GUN DEALING BUT THEY PLED GUILTY TO LESSER MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES AND WERE SENTENCED TO PROBATION. NOW ALL THIS BILL HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF MOVING PARTS REQUIRING LICENSED. DEALERS TO GET A LICENSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS SO IF AND WHEN THERE IS A BY OPERATION OF LAW DEATH TO DIVORCE WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES PROHIBITED THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT LOOKING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR PEOPLE TO OFFLOAD THEIR FIREARMS AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE MORE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] SECOND.

SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE FIVE WILL REDUCE THE COST OF COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND COMMISSARY ITEMS SOLD IN COUNTY JAILS. AND YOU WILL FACILITIES THAT WILL ALSO PROMOTE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY IN JAIL CONTRACTS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENABLE STRONGER FAMILY CONNECTIONS WHICH PROMOTES PUBLIC SAFETY IN REDUCES RECIDIVISM FOR RATE RATES. FOR PEOPLE FACE AN INCARCERATION. LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND CALIFORNIA ALLOWS EACH OF THE FIFTY A COUNTY SHERIFF TO NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS INDEPENDENTLY WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE COUNTY JAILS IN JUVENILE HALL. THE CONTRACT AND SERVICES ARE LARGELY UNREGULATED RESULTED IN PRIVATE COMPANIES GAMING PROFITS OFF THE BACKS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THE INMATE WELFARE FUND THE I. W. S. HAVE BEEN USED FOR PURPOSES THAT DO NOT PROMOTE THE REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. WHICH WAS WHAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO DO. I W. F. HAVE BEEN INSTEAD YOU FOR SERVICES THAT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN JAIL SHOULD ALREADY PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE THE PURCHASE OF SECURITY CAMERAS AND TRANSPORT BANDS. TO THIS IN THIS BILL WILL DO THE FOLLOWING IT WILL LIMIT THE CASA PHONE ELECTRONIC AND OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS. AND THE COST OF ITEM SOLD NGO COMMISSARIES WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN THIS ACT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITHIN CDC ARE -- VERTICALLY ROUND THE PHONE CONTRACTS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IT WAS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL THE THE PER MINUTE COST FOR PHONE CALLS WE'RE NOW TRYING TO DO THIS BILL DO THE SAME THINGS AT THE COUNTY JAIL LEVEL. THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS CONTRACTS FROM INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OR OTHER INCENTIVES FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF CONTRACTS. IT CLARIFIES THE PERMISSIBLE EXPENDITURES OF COUNTY INMATE WELFARE FUNDS AND IT REMAINS TO COUNTY INMATE WILL FOR FUN TO QUOTE INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S WELFARE FUNDS. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS THE SIMILE REDUCE THE COST OF PHONE CALLS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND TO EXPAND THESE COST REDUCTIONS OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS. PRIMARILY -- VIDEO AS WELL AS THE COMMISSARY ITEMS SOLD NGL SOURCE -- WE HAVE RECEIVED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- I'LL BE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS MEMBERS HABIT -- WE'VE GOT A COUPLE WITNESSES HERE WHO CAN TELL FIRSTHAND THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE EXORBITANT FEES -- THEY'VE EXPERIENCED IN COMMISSARIES AS WELL AS THE COMMUNICATIONS A WE KNOW THAT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO HAVE REGULAR AND CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. HELPS WITH RE ENTRY AND HELPS REDUCE RECIDIVISM THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF THE BILL WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ME CHAU POLITO FROM THE TRANS LATINA COALITION. AND THE MAKE OF MOTOR WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER WHO -- WAS FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES CONNECTING WITH HER LOVED ONES I APPRECIATE YOU ALL I'D BE WILLING TO TELL YOUR PERSONAL STORIES AND THE CHAIRMAN I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE BY MEANS TOTAL. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY BEGIN WRITING CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS A MAKE A MALTA I'M A POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE ON WOMEN'S FREEDOM CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO I'M ALSO A FORMALLY INCARCERATED MAMA -- AND SOMEBODY THAT WAS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF INCARCERATION. BOTH WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED AND WHEN I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE SUPPORTING MY HUSBAND AND FAMILY MEMBERS DURING THEIR INCARCERATIONS. ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SENATE BILL. FIVE FIVE FIVE THE CURRENT JAIL SYSTEM PLACES A HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE. WE TEND TO BE LOW INCOME -- WOMEN OF COLOR AND TEND TO BEAR THE HEAVIEST BURDENS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM -- WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED MY CHILDREN'S GRANDPARENTS CARED FOR THEM AND THEY OFTEN HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCEPTING THE PHONE CALL HOME FOR MOM OR PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE LITERALLY -- MY PHONE CALLS HOME FOR A FIFTEEN MINUTE PHONE CALL AVERAGE SEVENTEEN DOLLARS -- MY KIDS WOULD OFTEN SET A TIMER FIVE MINUTES A PIECE TO GET. A TIME TO SPEAK WITH ME AND IT ALWAYS PUZZLED ME I KNEW I WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR A CRIME THAT I HAD COMMITTED. BUT MY FAMILY WAS BEING PUNISHED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD TO RECEIVE PHONE CALLS HOME FROM MOM -- WITHIN THE PHONE CALLS HOME AND IS THE NUMBER ONE WAY THAT WE STAY CONNECTED WITH OUR LOVED ONES DURING THEIR INCARCERATION -- THIS THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSES VIDEO CALLS WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY WE STAY CONNECTED. I OFTEN HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CALLING HOME ON MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY -- CHOOSING TO CALL HOME WHEN IN YOUR LOVED ONE HAD PASSED AWAY -- IT WAS ALWAYS A CHOICE BECAUSE IT WAS A FINANCIAL -- A CHOICE THAT MY THAT MY FAMILY CARRIED -- I COULDN'T PARTICIPATE OR ENGAGE AS A MAMA THE WAY I KNEW I SHOULD EVEN THOUGH I WAS BEHIND BARS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARENT MY MY CHILDREN AND IT WAS A AN ISSUE OF COST FOR THAT MISSING MY PHONE CALLS. THE OTHER THING THAT'S A HUGE BURDEN ON OUR FAMILIES AS A COST OF COMMISSARY WHEN WE'RE INCARCERATED WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO WORK WHEN WE'RE IN THE COUNTY JAIL. SO WE ARE A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON OUR FAMILIES WE CAN'T SEND MONEY HOME TO THEM TO SUPPORT THEM. AND WE ALSO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR BASIC HYGIENE THAT WE NEED ONE WEARING HER SERRATED -- WE LIVE IN A REALLY SMALLQUARTERS DEODORANT SOAP THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO US IN THERE. AND WE TURN TO OUR FAMILIES TO ALSO PAY THOSE BILLS -- I I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT FIVE FIVE FIVE AND RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ON THE FAMILIES OF INCARCERATED LOVED ONES THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MACHE PULLEY THOUGH I AM THE POLICY COORDINATOR WITH THE TRANSIT THE IN A COALITION -- AND ON THE FLIP SIDE I AM ONE OF THOSE LOVE ONES THAT'S CONSTANTLY TRYING -- TO CALL MY SIBLINGS -- CA TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT -- BUT AS A MAKE A MENTION AND THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CONNECTION WITH LOVED ONES WHEN INCARCERATED IS A LOT OF THE TIME BASED ON YOUR WEALTH. OFTEN CAN ONLY SPEAK WHEN THEY MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO AFFORD BECAUSE THEY'RE REMINDERS OF WHAT YOU ARE PAYING. AND THE LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY HAVE LEFT ON YOUR CALL. THAT'S THE CASE OF MY SIBLINGS JOEY WHO IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY MEN'S CENTRAL JAIL. I OFTEN HEAR YOUR MEANING BALANCE IS ONE DOLLAR AND SIXTY FOUR CENTS. YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS REMAINING. AS I TRY TO RUSSIAN MY FINAL I LOVE USE. AS WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK BROWN QUEER TRANSPORT AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES ARE CRIMINALIZED. AT SEVERELY HIGH RATES THIS LEADS TO CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH FOR IT WHICH FURTHER MARGINALIZES AND PUSHES OUR PEOPLE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. THE COST OF COMMUNICATIONS ESPECIALLY PHONE CARDS AND COMMISSARY ITEMS IS INCONSISTENT IN COUNTY JAILS ACROSS THE STATE DUE TO THE FLEXIBILITY COUNTIES HAVE IN CHOOSING THEIR PHONE SERVICE AND COMMISSARY PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE A FIFTEEN MINUTE CALL CAN RANGE FROM SIXTY EIGHT CENTS IN A PLACE LIKE SAN MATEO COUNTY. VERY SAYS SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS IN LASSEN COUNTY. ALL THE PROFITS FROM BECAUSE AND GIO COMMISSARIES ARE PLACED INTO THE AND MAY WELL FOR FUNDS AS SENATOR MITCHELL MENTIONED AND IT'S BEEN FOUND IN ANNUAL REPORTS THAT THESE. THAT THIS MONEY IS BEING USED FOR THINGS LIKE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS BODY ARMOR AND TRANSPORT BANDS TO CHOIR. SO ESSENTIALLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN THE ONES PAYING FOR CALLS ARE THE ONES PAYING FOR EXPENSES OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THEIR POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GAINING MOMENTUM IN VARIOUS PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LIKE IN TEXAS WHICH CUT PHONE CALL COST FROM TWENTY SIX CENTS PER MINUTE TO SIX CENTS PERMANENT. IN NEW YORK CITY THEY ELIMINATED THEIR COSTS ALL TOGETHER. AND THEN MOST RECENTLY AND SAN FRANCISCO THEY JUST MADE THEIR PHONE CALLS FREE WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR. ULTIMATELY WE WANT TO AND THE BILL ABILITY FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PROFIT FOR PROFIT OFF OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE THEIR LOVED ONES AND THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHILE MAINTAINING THE ABILITY. FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE ON THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN CONTACTS. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE YOU VOTE YES ON SB FIVE BY. FIVE THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES TO SUPPORT.

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COULD YOU. COULD YOU GIVE THEM SOME ROOM SAY. THANK YOU. IF WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS WILL CALL YOU BACK -- I THOUGHT THERE WAS MORE PEOPLE SORRY. GIVE ME A COMPLEX MISTER TRY NOT. LEX IS JUST YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHORUS ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THEY LARGELY CENTER AROUND THE FACT THAT. UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR ZERO TWO FIVE THE PROCEEDS OF ANY PAYMENTS THAT ARE AT ISSUE HERE FROM A PROVIDER OF THESE PHONE SERVICES ARE REQUIRED. TO GO INTO THE INMATE WELFARE FUND AND THOSE FUNDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE SPENT PRIMARILY FOR THE BENEFIT. OF INMATES -- AND INCARCERATED PERSONS SO -- THAT'S THE SORT OF THEME THAT UNDERLIES ALL OF THIS THAT. TAKING AWAY THOSE PAYMENTS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE PAYMENTS TO BE PAID BY THE PHONE COMPANIES ARE BY THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. THOSE WILL HARM THE INMATES. WE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT'S OF THE CONTRACT MUST BE AWARDED TO THE PROVIDER. THAT MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS BUT ALSO OFFERS THE LOWEST COST APPEAR TO OF SERVICE TO THE PAIR OF THE SERVICE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU COULD HAVE TWO CONTRACTS ON THE TABLE ONE THAT OFFERS A RATE OF EIGHT CENTS A MINIMUM ONE THAT OFFERS A RATE OF SEVEN CENTS A MINUTE? THE EIGHT CENTS A MINUTE CONTRACT OFFERS FORMER SERVICES AND BENEFITS THE SEVEN CENTS A MINUTE IS BARE BONES BUT MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECS. THIS STATUTE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE SEVEN CENTS A MINUTE CONTRACT BE THE ONE THAT SELECTED -- THERE ARE ADDITIONAL -- RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT MICRO MANAGE THE PROCESS BY WHICH THESE CONTRACTS MUST BE LET -- BE INCLUDE A PROVISION THAT SAYS -- THE SHERIFF MUST BE ALLOWED IN THE CONTRACT TO RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AT ANY TIME NOT SURE WHY A PRIVATE ENTITY WOULD AGREE TO THAT -- BUT THEN THERE THE SHERIFF IS PUT IN A BOX BY STATUTE AGAIN STATE LAW REQUIRES THIS MONTH GOING TO BE A MEANWHILE FOR FUN IT PAYS FOR THINGS LIKE IN MEET EDUCATION VOCATIONAL TRAINING RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT. CLOTHING AND SUPPLIES FOR INDIGENT INMATES ABOUT TO BE RELEASED -- WE HAVE FISCAL NUMBERS FROM COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF WHAT THIS WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF MONEY THAT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM INCARCERATED PERSONS -- I THINK WE MAY HEAR SOME OF THAT IN THE UPCOMING TESTIMONY -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT -- AS I SAID THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN IN FEWER DOLLARS BEING AVAILABLE FOR INMATES SERVICES -- I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRIVATE COMPANIES WILL -- SEE AN IMPACT FROM THIS THEY'RE BEING TOLD BY THIS BILL YOU NO LONGER PAY THESE FEES ARE PAID THESE -- THESE THESE PAYMENTS -- I'D IT JUST AGAIN IT'S IT'S THE INMATES WHO ARE GOING TO SUFFER FROM THIS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND INMATES PAYING FOR THE SERVICES -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WITHOUT A BACK FILL THESE FUNDS ARE GOING AWAY AND NO SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE IN JEOPARDY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WITH US FOR AN OVER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PRINTED UP THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- IT RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION GOING OUT FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE WE'VE GOT -- CONTRACTS EDUCATION CONTRACTS. WITH VARIOUS PROVIDERS TOTALING ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT -- THIS WILL AFFECT SO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MARLON MARSHALL REPRESENTING THE SAN DIEGO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND AT THE IMPACT ON US IS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT INCLUDES PROGRAMS EVERYTHING FROM -- PROVIDING ASSOCIATE ART DEGREES TO CULINARY TRAINING. TO ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE -- AT THAT ARE ALL GOING TO BE JEOPARDIZED BECAUSE MY SHARES. GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED COME OUT IN A BETTER PLACE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE WE ALSO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND IN OUR CULINARY ARTS PROGRAM. THE RESTAURANT OWNERS ACTUALLY COME INTO OUR FACILITY TEACH THEM HOW TO INTERVIEW AND PROVIDE JOBS FOR THEM AND THAT'S HOW WE USE OUR IN THE WELFARE FUNDS [inaudible] THANK YOU. AS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS POLIO -- ON BEHALF OF THE BUTTE COUNTY BORDERS WHO WRITES FOR THE REASONS STATED BY STATE SHARES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS MR QUIRK. I HAVE A SIMILAR BILL TO THIS -- COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND GOT CAUGHT APPROPRIATIONS -- I WILL SAY THIS AT THE TIME I LOOKED AT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY USE. OF THE IN THE IN. INMATE WELFARE FUND I FOUND VERY LITTLE OF IT ACTUALLY WENT TO WELFARE THE INMATES IT WAS LARGELY USED. TO PAY FOR MORE DEPUTIES -- FURTHER WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS CHARGING PEOPLE FOR BEING IN JAIL AND MOST OF THEM CAN'T AFFORD ANYTHING THEY ARE BY AND LARGE POOL WHERE -- AND I JUST FIND THE WHOLE PROCESS DISGUSTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WICKS WHICH YES IT WAS KAMLAGER-DOVE. I'M A SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE I THINK PEOPLE -- GENERALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COST OF NOT BEING OF PRIVILEGE AND HOW PERVERSELY EVIDENT IT IS WITH REGARDS TO THE PENAL CODE. AND THE REALITY IS. OFTEN TIMES. EVEN IF YOU HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG YOU MAY NOT BE INCARCERATED IF YOU ARE ABLE TO AFFORD. A GOOD DEFENSE. AND SO THESE THINGS DON'T EVEN AREN'T EVEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND SO THIS IS REALLY A CONVERSATION. ABOUT. SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION THAT ARE OVER MONITORED. OVER CHARGED OVER PROSECUTED OVER INCARCERATED IN BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR THAN THEIR OVER CHARGED AGAIN FINANCIALLY. FOR ME I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MISTER DOCTOR QUIRK IT'S DISGUSTING AVIDIN OF LIKE A TWENTY NINETEEN JANE GAME. YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO GET AND TO KEEP MONEY ON THE BOOKS AND HOW QUICKLY THOSE DOLLARS. AND CENTS GO AWAY AND HOW OFTEN THEY CAN BE LEVERAGED. AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MANY OF WHAT THE OPPONENTS SAID ABOUT THESE REALLY GOOD AND IMPORTANT. AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED AND THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM I WOULD HOPE THAT PASSING THIS BILL DOES NOT MEAN. THAT WE WILL GET RID OF THOSE PROGRAMS WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BINARY CONVERSATIONS. BUT WE ALSO SHOULDN'T PAY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE BACKS OR PAY FOR A SYSTEM RATHER ON THE BACKS OF THE POOR AND WE MUST BE ABLE OF FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY FOR THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES. I DO -- IT DOES MAKE ME THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT IS YOU KNOW CHEAP THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN BEST. AND SO YOU KNOW BEST VALUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO GET LIKE THE CHEAPEST CONTRACT AND THEN THAT MEANS YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON A CRICKET OR METRO PCS KIND OF SYSTEM. NO OFFENSE -- YOU KNOW. SHE JUST SLAMMED THE WHOLE I DID NOT I TELL A PHONE COMPANY. MY GRANDMOTHER HAD A JUNE BUG SO. BUT I'M JUST I'M SAYING I ALSO HOPE THAT NOT HAVING THE CHEAPEST CONTRACT. DOESN'T LIMIT THE VALUE YOU KNOW INVEST VALUE IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS A FAMILY AND FRIENDS BUT IT'S ALSO COUNSEL. IT'S COUNCIL THAT ARE TALKING TO INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S AND FIGURING OUT A WAY TO ELIMINATE FOLKS IS ABILITY TO HAVE THEIR DUE PROCESS AND THEY HAVE COUNSEL DR THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. IS. IN MY OPINION UNCONSCIONABLE SO THAT IS A VERY LONG WAY OF SAYING THAT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. AND IF I MAY REFER THIS BURKE REPLIED TO COME WITH ME THAT BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOESN'T ELIMINATE. THE INMATE WELFARE FUND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS -- I AM ASKING THE SHERIFF'S INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY TO DO THE SAME DUE DILIGENCE WE ALL DO PERSONALLY. IF TARGET HAS. DEODORANT FOR TWENTY DOLLARS THE TWO WHEN I CAN GET IT ON AMAZON PRIME OR COSCO. FOR FIVE I'M GOING FOR THE FIVE DOLLAR OPTION NO ONE HERE WOULD WILLINGLY PAY TWENTY DOLLARS. FOR TWO BUT DEODORANT WHEN YOU COULD HAVE A COMPETITIVE OPTION AND IF YOU'RE IN COUNTY JAIL YOU DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION. AS AN INCARCERATED PERSON. THE SHARE OF DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE CONTRACT. WITH REGARD TO THE INMATE WELFARE FUND AND HOW THE FUNDS ARE USED. AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY HAD A BALANCE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THEIR INMATE WELFARE FUND. LA COUNTY THE IN THE FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN HAD A BALANCE OF TWENTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SAN FRANCISCO HAD A BALANCE OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION. HOW THE MONIES HAVE BEEN SPENT FOR FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- TOLD EXPENDITURES WERE EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION OF WHICH THREE POINT TWO WAS SPENT ON QUOTE ADMINISTRATION. INCLUDING SALARIES VEHICLES OFFICE SUPPLIES BANK FEES VOLUNTEER TRAINING CELLPHONES AND NETWORK. IN MAKES SERVICE EXPENDITURES FROM THE FUN WERE ONE HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN FIXING THE SAN FRANCISCO IDEA VIA. TOLD EXPENDITURES WERE ONE POINT TWO OF WHICH SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WERE FOR QUOTE PERMANENT SALARIES AND FRINGE BENEFITS. SO I FULLY APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE HERE IN TERMS OF THE GOOD WORK BEING DONE BY IN MIGHT WELL FOR FUNDS. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE [inaudible] I SHOULD. AS THE MOTHER LET'S SAY IF INCARCERATED PERSON. PUT MONEY ON THEIR BOOKS. WEEKLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WORK TO EARN. IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION WITH MY CHILD OR MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE TO PACE TOOTHBRUSH DEODORANT. AND SOAP. AND THE BILL AND THE PROFIT FROM THOSE EXPENDITURES EXPENDITURES GO TO PAY FOR SALARIES THAT'S WHAT BUDGETS ARE FOR IN GENERAL FUND IS FOR TO PAY FOR CORPS OPERATING COSTS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AGAIN EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT THIS BILL DOES ELIMINATE THE FUN IT JUST ASKS THAT SHARE US ON OUR PRUDENT IN THEIR CONTRACTING MS WORKS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IN THE BILL AND THANK YOUR WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED -- TO THE WITH A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I THINK. WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING NOW IS DOING EVERYTHING TO ENCOURAGE CONNECTIVITY THE FOLKS WHO ARE SERVING TIME WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THOSE THAT CARE ABOUT THEM? THAT'S HOW WE ULTIMATELY REDUCE RECIDIVISM THAT'S HOW WE CREATE SAFER COMMUNITIES I THINK THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE TO DO IN THAT VEIN -- ALL THE SUPPORTING AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK TO BE A CO AUTHOR AS WELL. THANK YOU ARE DEALING IN A BACKUP POWER CAME. YEAH I THINK I WOULD ASK A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES MADE BECAUSE AS AN ATTORNEY MY CLIENTS USED TO THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY NEED TO GET A HOLD OF ME AND CAN USE THE OTHER SYSTEMS. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IT'S CRUCIAL THAT CAN ACTIVITY TO BOTH COUNCIL WHICH IS A RIGHT THESE FOLKS HAVE. AS WELL AS CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR FAMILIES IS CRUCIAL THAT THING THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE THE MOST IS HOW DO WE REDUCE RECIDIVISM HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO NOT COMMIT CRIMES TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT WE AS A STATE OR SPENDING. ON INCARCERATING CALIFORNIANS AND WE KNOW THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR FAMILIES REDUCES RECIDIVISM WE DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THESE FUNDS REDUCE RECIDIVISM BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THAT DATA. SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND THAT WE SHOULD DO IT AND THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE FOR IT ANYTHING THAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAVERS AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT WE ARE SPENDING ON PRISONS. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE A SAY IN CLOSING YOU KNOW. WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS POPULATION IN OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THEM. YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY A BILL AT A TIME BUT IN TOTALITY THE SHERIFFS AND OTHERS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN KILLING AN EFFORT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IN PERSON VISITS -- THE THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL ALONG WITH TO BE A FIFTY IN CONVINCING THE GOVERNOR THAT THAT WOULD BE -- I'LL DO -- FINANCIAL -- OUT LIABILITY IN THAT MANY COUNTY JAILS NOW ARE BEING BUILT WITHOUT IN PERSON VISITATION ACCOMMODATIONS SO NOW PEOPLE ARE BE LIMITED TO EVEN HOW THEY CAN HAVE CONTACT WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. AND IT'S THROUGH PHONE OR COMPUTER SERVICES NONE OF US HERE WOULD KEEP A PHONE PLAN THAT CHARGED US SEVENTEEN DOLLARS FOR A FIFTEEN MINUTE CALL. NOBODY WOULD. AND SO WHY THESE CONTRACTS ARE ACCEPTABLE. IN COUNTY FACILITIES IS BEYOND ME. SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN ACTION TO LIMIT THE WAY PEOPLE COULD HAVE HUMAN CONTACT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS. WE LIMIT THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN JAIL TO EARN MONEY. WE ARE NOW. CHARGING THEM EXORBITANT FEES TO TRY TO LIVE HUMANELY WHILE INCARCERATED AND TO HAVE PHONE CONTACT WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WHAT MORE CAN WE ASK FROM THEM? I THINK SB FIVE FIVE FIVE IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. WE ARE NOT ELIMINATING THE WEALTH IN MAY WELL FOR FUN WE ARE WE NAY MINUTES WHAT'S MORE APPROPRIATE -- TO THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT HOW IT CAN BE USE AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE SHERIFF'S% THE MIND THE CONTRACTS THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR FACILITATING. JUST AS THEY WOULD THEIR OWN CELL PHONE SERVICE OR COMPUTER SERVICE OR WHAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR DEODORANT AT HOME. I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION HAVING BEEN AN EMPLOYER AND RUN ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE BUDGETS. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR I ENTER TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AND LET ME. JUST FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION TO TO HOPEFULLY. MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND. WHAT WHAT WHAT A LOT OF MEMBERS HERE SEE ON IS A TERM CALLED A INDENTURED SERVANTS. ON THAT WAS USED. WHEN YOU DO ACTUALLY PAY SOMEONE BUT? BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE COMPANY STORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY TO USE THE LAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RENT. THE HOUSING AT THEIR AND THEY CAN NEVER GET OUT OF INDENTURED SERVITUDE. AFTER SLAVERY DO A LOT OF SLAVE TO COULDN'T LEAVE THE PLANTATION BECAUSE OF INDENTURED SERVITUDE. AND I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS THIS FEEL OF JUSTICE PRISON SYSTEM THAT JUST KEEPS YOU DARE FINANCIALLY ECONOMICALLY. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM A LOT OF MEMBERS IS IT WE DON'T NEED TO PERPETUATE THAT AND AND WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE SENATOR -- I USED TO DO COMPETITIVE BIDDING [inaudible] TO AND LOWEST COMPETITIVE BID DOESN'T MEAN DOES THE LOWEST NUMBER IT MEANS COMPETITIVE. AND YOU SHOULD GET YOU SHOULD THE BOSS BANG FOR YOUR BUCK WHEN IT COMES. TO TO TO WHAT YOU GET FOR FOR ANY SERVICE. I THINK WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S THE SAME WITH A COMPANY STORE. THEY BY THE SOAP. FOR FIVE DOLLARS BUT G. [inaudible] FOR SIXTY THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT GOOD AND THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT'S LOOKING LIKE RIGHT NOW AND THEN USE THAT MONEY -- IN THIS INTIMATE WELFARE FUND FOR WHAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE A CERTAINWAY. AND MAY WE DIDN'T PUT ENOUGH -- SPECIFIC. REQUIRED WHO JUSTICE MAYBE JUST ASSUME. THAT YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO THAT IT WOULD GO DIRECTLY TO THE FOR THE INMATES AND NOT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE OTHER THINGS AND SO HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS CLARIFY THAT. SUCH YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONTRACTS WHICH NO ONE'S TRYING TO STOP IT BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF IT -- I GUESS IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING. GO AHEAD AND GET THE BEST PROVIDERS SO THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE IN MAY -- AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A MARKUP OF A 1000% NINETY THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS AND AND SAID SHE ULTIMATELY DIDN'T GET THAT MONEY BACK TO HELP. WITH THE WELFARE AS I HEARD SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT -- TRAINING. LANGUAGE TRAINING GETTING BETTER EDUCATION AND OTHER THINGS SO THAT WE DO THAT BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT. ULTIMATELY BOTH THE SHERIFF'S AND WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO. AND SO CHAIRED RECOMMENDING AN AYE. VOTE. ON SB FIVE FIVE FIVE THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER CHEN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAND BARRICADE HAD I'D DEEP KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO I WICKS HI WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE SB SEVEN ONE SIX JUVENILE DELINQUENCY POST SECONDARY ACADEMIC AND CAREER TECHNICAL TRAINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS BILL CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF SENATE DEMOCRATIC. POLICY RETREAT COUPLE YEARS AGO WE HAD A YOUNG MAN COME FOR TO TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE -- IN JUVENILE HALL OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME IT WAS UPON HIS RELEASE AND ENTERING COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT HE REALLY. FULLY BEGAN TO EMBRACE -- THE HOW. FAR SHORT HE HAD FALLEN IN TERMS OF HIS OWN ACADEMIC PURSUITS -- WE SPEND A YEAR WE PUT TOGETHER A TASK FORCE LOOK DID JUVENILE HALLS AND YOU LOOK CAPS REALLY ACROSS THE STATE TO REALLY BEGIN TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE EXPERIENCE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE HAVING VERTICALLY WITH REGARD TO THERE ARE -- EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT -- WHILE INCARCERATED -- A THOUGHTFUL HELPFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE THE VARIOUS MODELS ACROSS THE STATE BILL THAT ARE WORKING THOSE THAT ARE NOT. AND FROM THAT EXPERIENCE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF BILLS -- COME TO US -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN WILL TAKE A CORRECTIVE STEPS TOWARDS ENSURING THAT INCARCERATED YOUTH WHO ALREADY HOLD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HAVE ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND CAREER VOCATIONAL TRAINING. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRED YOU WILL FACILITIES TO PROVIDE POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS FOR THESE YOU. STATUTES ONLY REQUIRES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE FACILITY TO PROVIDE A FULL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM TO YOUTH IN CUSTODY. WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL SO FOR THOSE OF COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR TIME ALL DAY WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED? ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE CO WITH PROVIDE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN CUSTODY. STATE REGULATIONS DO REQUIRE COUNTY PROBATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL YOUTH IN THEIR FACILITIES. ARE TREATED EQUALLY WITH REGARD TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ADDITIONALLY THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS STATES THAT YOU IN D. J. F. THE STILL THESE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. THE YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS DOES NOT PLACE AT AGE OR GRADE LEVEL LIMITATION ON THESE RIGHTS. WE'VE HEARD VARIOUS CONCERNS FROM THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS REGARDING TIMING OF SEMESTER SCHEDULES UNFUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE IN STAFFING COSTS OF THE SHORT LENGTH OF STAY WE BELIEVE -- WITH THE HELP -- OF THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL MEMBERS THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING TODAY AND WORK THAT WE'VE DONE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS STYLES -- WE'VE MINUTE THE BILL TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS COURSE ELIGIBILITY AND COURSE SCHEDULING CONCERNS -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH REGARD TO THE UNFUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THERE IS A ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT THAT ALREADY MANDATES THE COUNTY FACILITIES PROVIDE ACCESS TO INTERNET AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. FOR PURPOSES OF EDUCATION SO THESE YOU COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR TUITION WAIVERS THEREFORE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TUITION THEY COULD TAKE THE CLASSES ON LAKE ONLINE IN. TUITION HAS BEEN WAY. I WITH REGARD TO THEIR THE RELATIVE INCONSISTENT YOU KNOW SENTENCING LENGTH OF STAY IN VERY FUEL FACILITIES. THAT'S WHY MAKING SURE THAT THESE CAN AUG COURSES ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE SO THE YOUTH WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION ONCE THEIR RELEASE -- WE AGREE THAT THE BILL SHOULD -- REQUIRE A POSTSECONDARY AND VOCATIONAL PLAN -- AND WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BOLSTER KIND OF THE THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF THIS BILL WITH THE INCLUSION OF SUCH A PLAN BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN IN LIEU OF ACTUALLY PROVIDING PROGRAMMING. IT SHOULD NOT BE EITHER OR IDEALLY BOTH BUT MINIMALLY WE'RE AXE IN THROUGH THIS BILL THAT PROGRAM MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH C. P. L. C. AS WE HAVE. TO TALK ABOUT -- HOW WE COULD BOLSTER THE BILL TO INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF THE PLAN? A QUALITY EDUCATION HAS THE POWER TO READ THE LETTER RE DIRECT THE LIVES OF ANYBODY YOUTH OR ADULT ESPECIALLY THOSE. TOUCHED BY THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING DEVELOPS OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS AT LEAST THE PRODUCTIVE CAREER PATH WHICH IN TURN REDUCES RECIDIVISM. AND FUTURE INVOLVEMENT WITH ANY JUSTICE SYSTEM. SOME LOCALITIES ALREADY HAVE THESE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS AND PROGRAMS IN PLACE ONE OF THOSE PROJECTS IS PROJECT CHANGE IN THE COLLEGE OF SAN MATTEO. DID CHANGES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SUPPORT A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A WRAPAROUND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES DIRECT ACCESS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH AND ACTUALLY IN PERSON COLLEGE INSTRUCTION. INSIDE YOU WILL YOU FACILITIES WITH ME TODAY IS KATIE BLISS PROJECT DIRECTOR OF PROJECT CHANGE. AND LUCY CARTER. POLICY ADVOCATE FOR USE LAWCENTERI ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] YES. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE. TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO I SAT IN A DIMLY LIT CELL ON A PAPER THIN MATTRESS IN JUVENILE HALL. AND I FRANTICALLY WROTE A LETTER TO THE JUDGE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE MY HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. I SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION IN AND OUT OF JUVENILE HALL AND WAS INCARCERATED FOR THE MOST CRITICAL YEARS WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO A PROM. OR WALKING ACROSS THE STAGE FOR MY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION INSTEAD I WAS LOCKED UP AND LOCKED OUT OF THE FUTURE. I COULD BARELY SEE A WAY OUT AT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE. AT THAT TIME THE PRIORITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS NOT EDUCATION. AND THERE CERTAINLY WAS A DIRECT SUPPORT FOR GOING TO COLLEGE I'VE FOUGHT HARD TO COMPLETE MY HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND WHEN I WAS RELEASED FROM CUSTODY THE IDEA OF COLLEGE WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND. HOWEVER AFTER A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS POST RELEASE IT BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT DESPITE NEVER IMAGINING MYSELF TO BE COLLEGE MATERIAL. I WOULD NEED TO ENROLL IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF I WERE TO EVER HAVE A SHOT AT A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE. NAVIGATING COLLEGES DIFFICULT FOR ANYBODY -- WHEN YOU'RE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES DISJOINTED FROM BEING INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE PATH IS PAVED WITH WHAT CAN SEEM LIKE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES? I WAS REALLY LUCKY THAT I FOUND SUPPORTIVE PROFESSORS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PEERS COMING FROM OTHER CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES HE WOULD HELP ME TO MAKE IT THROUGH COLLEGE. I ENDED UP TRANSFERRING TO THE UNIVERSITY OBTAINING MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND WENT ON TO COMPLETE GRADUATE WORK WITH THE GOAL TO TEACH AND BE OF SERVICE TO OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION. BUT MY EXPERIENCE MAKING IT OUT OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE IS A RARE WHEN AS STATISTICS TELL US MOST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM GOING TO ENTER THE ADULT PRISON SYSTEM AND RARELY DO THOSE WHO MAKE IT OUR EARN. A COLLEGE DEGREE IT'S OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE COLLEGE WHILE STILL IN CUSTODY THAT WILL GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM A PIPELINE TO HIGHER EDUCATION RATHER THAN TO PRESS THEM. AFTER GRADUATE SCHOOL I RETURNED TO MY FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO TEACH ENGLISH. I DID THIS FOR EIGHT YEARS BEFORE CREATING PROJECT CHANGE WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE COLLEGE PROGRAM THAT ASSIST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS PROGRAM IS THAT THE SAME JUVENILE HALL WHERE I WAS ONCE INCARCERATED. AND INCREDIBLY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM I WORKED ALONGSIDE MY OLD PROBATION OFFICER WHO WOULD BECOME THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THESE DECADES LATER. ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM KNOW THAT COLLEGE IS THE POWER TO CHANGE LIVES A COLLEGE EDUCATION CREATES JOB OPPORTUNITIES IF AUTHORS LEADERSHIP. AND IMPROVE THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF STUDENTS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN IS THE RIGHT NEXT MOVE TO CREATE ACCESS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THIS ACCESS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CUSTODY WHO HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD TO COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL. THE STUDENTS IN PROJECT CHANGE TAKE COLLEGE COURSES FOR CREDIT FROM COLLEGE PROFESSORS WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED AT THE JUVENILE HALL AND ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED THEY TAKE COURSES ON CAMPUS AT THE COLLEGE. THESE STUDENTS ARE LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY AND ON CAMPUS THEY SPEAK AT CONFERENCES THEY GO BACK TO THE JUVENILE HALL TO SHARE THEIR STORIES TO HELP OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE FIND THEIR WAY TO COLLEGE. WE HAVE STUDENTS THIS YEAR GRADUATING. GOING TO SAN FRANCISCO STATE SAN JOSE STATE AND UCLA. COLLEGE LEVEL EDUCATION FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH AS DESCRIBED IN SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN WILL NOT BE COSTLY WE PROVIDE THIS SERVICE AND PROJECT CHANGE IN A COMPRISES ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE SECONDARY COST SAVINGS FROM CHANGING THE PATH OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO PREVENT FUTURE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND INCARCERATION AS ADULTS IS PROFOUND. COLLEGE CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF RECIDIVISM AND TRANSFORM FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY LEADERS THE AND ROLE MODELS. WHEN A STUDENT OBTAINS A COLLEGE EDUCATION IT THIS DOESN'T JUST IMPACT THEM AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND AS A RIPPLE EFFECT? THAT POSITIVELY ALTERS PATHWAYS FOR THEIR FAMILY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY SUMMARILY NOT ONLY ARE THE UP FRONT COST OF SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN LOW BUT THE FINANCIAL SAVINGS THAT WILL BE IMPARTED UPON OUR STATE AND SOCIETY WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL. OUR SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE SETTING UP COLLEGE PROGRAMMING INSIDE A JUVENILE HALL ILLUSTRATES THIS IS A VERY CHEAP A BALL AND PRACTICAL TASK. IT'S JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS OUR COLLEGE PROGRAMMING HAS ASSISTED HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS IN JUVENILE DETENTION AND TO ACHIEVE THEIR POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL GOALS WITH MINIMAL FINANCIAL INVESTMENT. AS A RESULT OF USING ALREADY EXISTING RESOURCES THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM MOST OF THE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN OUR PROGRAM AND IN THE TYPES OF SERVICES SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN PROPOSES ARE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEREFORE QUALIFY FOR FEE WAIVERS FOR CREE CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS THEY'RE GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AT THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID AND I TUITION AND BOOKS COVERED. THE COST OFFER COURSES INSIDE DETENTION FACILITIES ARE VERY SMALL BUT THE RESULT IS HUGE AND POSITIVE AND PACKS. ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SO WHEN FOR ALL AND FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL SEVEN SIXTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE WITNESSES. YOU'RE OUT ONE MINUTE THIS IS LUCY SALCEDO CARTER I'M THE POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER WERE SPONSORING THE BILL AND I'M JUST AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

ON SB SEVEN SIXTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. HI GEN SIR HI LACKEY.

MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- FOR ALLOW ME TO PRESENT SB -- FORTY FIVE THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR A NON VEHICLE RELATED CRIME. AND SUSPENDING A DRIVER'S LICENSE -- KIND OF BECAME A POPULAR. METHOD OF PUNISHMENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHETHER OR NOT A CRIME HAD ANYTHING DO WITH OPERATING A VEHICLE -- AND IT'S REALLYSTRANGE BECAUSE SOME CRIMES HAVE THIS IN SOME KIND STONE IS IT'S COMMA HAPHAZARDLY -- BEEN APPLIED -- IT DOES NOT INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY IT ONLY DETERS A PERSON'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN WORK. AND MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND PAY RESTITUTION WHEN I BECAME CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE -- TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. OF ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID IS WE WENT AND VISITED THE HOMELESS SHELTER FOR WOMEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WE TALK TO THE WOMEN IN THE SHELTER AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR CARS TAKEN AWAY FROM. AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE CHILDREN THAT WERE IN THE TAKEN AWAY FROM ALSO BECAUSE THE CAR WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM. SO IF IT HURTS TO ME THAT -- THIS HAS -- A DEFINITE IMPACT ON A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES AND AND THEREFORE -- TONIGHT VOTE I THINK THIS WOULD HELP -- PEOPLE IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE CRIMINAL. OF CODE THAT ONLY DEALS WITH THE VEHICLE CAUGHT. SO -- TIME BUT WE HAVE WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LAURIE DOYLE ABOUT THE CONFERENCE A CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. THE ANALYSIS -- GOES INTO A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE BILL ON WHY IT'S A GOOD IDEA. IT'S JUST LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE ONE THING THAT. ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOR IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOWEVER. THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS BILL RECORD WILL RETAIN ITS AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE PERSON'S LICENSE BE SUSPENDED OR REVOKED. AS A RESULT IN A CONVICTION FOR A FELONY OFFENSE. PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE AND THE VEHICLE. IN ORDER OTHER WORDS THE BILL ALLOWS THE COURTS TO CONTINUE. TO DISPENSE JUSTICE TO CRAFT -- SENTENCES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT DO NOT REFLECT JUST THE A **** NILLY. THIS IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE A LICENSE AWAY EVEN THOUGH THE THE UNDERLYING CRIME HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VEHICLE AND THE VEHICLE WAS USED DURING THE COMMISSION THEREOF.

IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RAIN I HOPE YOU WILL STAY IN TOUCH WITH US THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS SUMMER. AND I WILL LET EVERYBODY CLAP. THERE WELCOME HERE THAT IS -- ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN SB. FIVE EIGHT ZERO ANIMAL ABUSE PROBATION TREATMENT. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS PAULA JONES FOR BEING LATE BUT I HAD A MEETING WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND YOU DO NOT MAKE DOCTOR WEBER WAY. SO -- PROGRAM PRESENTING SB FIVE EIGHTY WHICH YOU'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO MAKE A CHANGE IN OUR PENAL SYSTEM BUT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO SAVE LIVES. IT'S BEEN PROVEN THAT ANIMAL ABUSE IS LINKED TO VIOLENCE TOWARDS PEOPLE. THOSE WHO ABUSE ANIMALS WILL OFTEN END UP COMMITTING MUCH GREATER OFFENSES ACCORDING TO STUDIES 31% OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS HAVE ABUSED ANIMALS AT SOME POINT IN THEIR PAST. 70% OF THE MOST VIOLENT PRISON INMATES HAVE A HISTORY OF ANIMAL ABUSE. GIVEN THIS KNOWLEDGE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT WILL THAT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ISN'T WORKING RECIDIVISM RATES FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY CRIMES ARE HIGH IN OFFENDERS ARE ALL OFTEN ELEVATE. TO MORE SERIOUS CRIMES SB FIVE EIGHTY WOULD REQUIRE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY OFFENSES INSURING THAT DEFENDANTS GET THE HELP THEY NEED. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS WITH pPRINT AND I DO WANT TO DRESS THEM. IF WE GET THIS OUT TODAY WE'D LIKE TO MAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO GET THIS TO A BETTER PLACE. WE PLAN TO DROP THE THE MAIN EDUCATION PROVISION WELL I STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOOD POLICY BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE. AND I RESPECT THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE PROPER TIME TO PURSUE THAT. WILL ALSO WERE ALSO WILLING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CRIMES THAT TRIGGER MANDATORY EVALUATION TO ONLY THOSE THAT HAVE THE ABSOLUTE MOST SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS. AND HIGHEST POTENTIAL FOR RECIDIVISM THIS WOULD INCLUDE INTENTIONALLY MAIMING OR TORTURING AN ANIMAL. WE WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS -- PROTECTING ANIMALS IN PEOPLE'S IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WITH ME TODAY IS LINDSEY LARISA WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SENATOR -- MY NAME IS LINDSAY LARSON HERE ON BEHALF FAMILY -- DEFENSE FUND THE SPONSOR SENATE BILL. FIVE EIGHTY YEAH I'M THE ANIMAL CRUELTY AND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION ACT EMPOWERS COURTS WITH KEY TOOL TO HELP REHABILITATE CONVICTED ANIMAL ABUSERS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIOR AND ACTUALLY PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE BOTH ANIMALS AND HUMANS. A CENTER WELCOME NOTED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST TWO DECADES NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED A STRONG LINK BETWEEN VIOLENCE ANIMALS AND BALANCE OF PEOPLE. WITHOUT INTERVENTION THOSE WHO USE ANIMALS OFTEN GO TO BE USE THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR SPOUSES OR TO COMMIT OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE. THIS LINK AREAS OF ANIMAL ABUSE ARE -- CHILD ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS WELL AS AND ELDER ABUSE ALL OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING. THEY ALL OF VULNERABLE VICTIMS IN FACT MOST WOMEN ENTERING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS REPORT THAT THEIR ABUSER ALSO KILLED HARMED OR THREATENED TO CAL PAT. RECOGNIZING THAT THIS LINK EXISTS THERE'S CURRENTLY THIRTIES TO STATE THAT HAVE LEGISLATION EITHER PERMITS REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING. AS PER PROBATION UNDER SENTENCING IN CASE OF AN OBVIOUS CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM. MANY OF THESE SAME STATES EITHER HAVE MANDATORY -- PERMISSIVE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION HAPPENING POST CONVICTION AND PRE SENTENCE WITH THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE OF ADVISING JUDGES ON THE BEST COURSE OF TREATMENT TO REHABILITATE THE OFFENDER. TO THE STATE'S INCLUDE ILLINOIS IN COLORADO WHICH ARE HIGHLY RANKED AS PROTECTIVE OF ANIMALS. ACCORDING TO THE LG LDF. SB FIVE EIGHTY IS IMPORTANT EXCEPT FOR CALIFORNIA IN COMBAT IN THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE WHILE PROVIDING NECESSARY REHABILITATIVE SERVICES TO OFFENDERS. SB FIVE EIGHTY PROVIDES JUDGES WITH INVALUABLE TOOL A REPORT FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. THE PROVIDES INDIVIDUALIZED RECOMMENDATION AS TO TREATMENT WHILE LEAVING JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION AS TO WHAT TREATMENT IF ANY. IS TO BE ORDER AS A CONDITION OF PAROLE. AS CENTER WILL MENTION TAKING CONCERNS OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS COMMITTEE INTO ACCOUNT WE'RE PREPARED TO MAKE AMENDMENTS NARROWING DOWN THE CATEGORIES OF FENCES TRIGGERING MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION. TO ENSURE THAT ONLY OFFENDERS OF ANIMAL CRUELTY CRIMES OF HIGH CORRELATION UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES MOST OF WHOM WERE ALREADY REQUIRE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. THEY RECEIVE THE EVALUATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ACTUAL COUNSELING IS NARROWLY TAILORED FITS THE INDIVIDUAL AND PROVIDES THE BEST CHANCE FOR MEANINGFUL THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATION. MISSIONS WORK IN THE FIELD A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN IS KEY IN MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION ON THE MOST APPROPRIATE TYPE OF THERAPY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. THE RESULT OF THIS EVALUATION ARE CRUCIAL IN PROVIDING THE CORRECT DIAGNOSTIC TOOL AND THEREFORE HAVE TARGETED PLANNING. RESEARCH IN THE FIELD HIS SHOULD PROMISING RESULTS WITH THE TYPE OF COUNSELING KNOWN AS MORAL RECOGNITION RECOGNITION THERAPY AND MARTY. WHICH SPECIFICALLY SEEKS TO DECREASE RECIDIVISM AMONG BUT BOTH JUVENILE AND ADULT CRIMINAL OFFENDERS BY INCREASING MORAL REASONING FOR VARIATION OF THE WELL KNOWN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR APPROACH. WHAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW FIELD OF STUDY THERE'S BEEN EVIDENCE THIS TYPE OF THERAPY REDUCES RECIDIVISM IN JUVENILE AND ADULT POPULATIONS. IT'S ONE TYPE OF TREATMENT AVAILABLE BUT ANIMAL ABUSE CAN BE CONNECTED TO A WIDE RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. AND THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS. WITH THE RANGE OF UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. A MANIFESTING THE KIND OF ANIMAL ABUSE IT'S LOGICALFOR REHABILITATION OF THE OFFENDER. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC PUBLIC AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN THAT RECOMMENDATION. ALSO NOTABLY AT FIVE EIGHTY SO LEAVE THE ULTIMATE DISCRETION THE HANDS OF THE JUDGE WHO CAN BALANCE THAT RECOMMENDATION WITH ISSUES OF JUSTICE AND ANY UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE OFFENDER. THE GOAL OF SUCH EVALUATION AND POTENTIALLY TREATMENT IS NOT TO PUNISH THE READ THE OFFENDER BUT TO PROVIDE HIM OR HER AT THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. AND AVOID RE OFFENDING MANDATORY COUNSELING PROGRAMS RELATED CRIME SUCH AS BATTERIES PROGRAMS OR PARENTING PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN CREATED FOR ANIMAL ABUSE OFFENSES. INSTEAD THE COURTS SENTENCED MOST OF THESE OFFENDERS TO THE MANDATORY COUNCIL REQUIREMENTS IN GENERAL ANGER MANAGEMENT. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THIS CAN BE PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT ACTUALLY ADDRESS UNDERLYING ISSUES. SB FIVE EIGHTY WILL BE IMPORTANT AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND HELPING NUMEROUS PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT ANIMALS AND THE PUBLIC FROM FUTURE VIOLENCE. THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORTED AND OF HOUSE AND SENATE UNANIMOUSLY. SO WE COMMEND CENTER WELL FOR INTRODUCING THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH. AND IS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ORDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALMOST GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHARON RILEY ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IT IS CURRENTLY. IN PRINT -- BEFORE YOU START AND DISCUSS OUR OUR CONCERNS I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS -- FOR ENGAGING WITH US SENATE BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT -- WE HAVEN'T SEEN A NAFF -- WE DID RECEIVE THE DRAFT AMENDMENTS LATE LAST NIGHT. OR LATE AFTERNOON WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE. TO DIGEST THEM SO I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST. RAISE THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE AS THE BILL IS A CURRENTLY IN PRINT. SO WHATEVER FIRST CONCERNS IS THAT IT REQUIRES JUDGES TO ORDER THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE PERMISSIVE IN THAT IT SHOULD BE DISCRETIONARY. ON BEHALF OF THE COURTS AT THE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THERE'S A VERY BROAD RANGE OF OF CRIMES THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE MENTAL HEALTH OF VALUE MANDATORY MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATIONS. ANOTHER CONCERN AND I I KNOW THAT MY MY COLLEAGUE HERE WILL GET INTO IT MORE. IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CYCLE PSYCHOLOGIST TO THE REVIEW. AND AN ONGOING -- CHALLENGE THE COURTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED IS THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE RESOURCES -- SO WITH THAT SAID -- WITH THAT IN OUR VIEW OF THE FACT THAT NOT ALL OF THE NEW MARRIED AND CRIMES WOULD. LEND THEMSELVES TO A MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION WE THINK THAT WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE -- USE OF COURT RESOURCES TO GO DOWN THIS PATH PARTICULARLY BECAUSE UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A COURT ORDERS THE MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION THE COURT MUST PAY FOR IT -- WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. IT APPEARS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THE EVALUATION TO BE ORDERED AFTER CONVICTION AND SENTENCE SCENE -- ORDINARILY WE WOULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS PERHAPS. AFTER CONVICTION BUT PRIOR TO CERTAIN SCENES WHAT COULD BE PART OF THE PROBATION. REPORT AND THEN FINALLY -- THE PROVISIONS RELATING TO ABILITY TO PAY AND WHEN SOMEBODY IS NOT ABLE TO PAY WHO IS GOING TO STEP IN AND PAY FOR THE COUNSELING -- WE BELIEVE ARE UNCLEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AND THEN GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- BUT IT'S STILL MORNING -- TYLER IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS INTENT TO ADDRESS THE LINK BETWEEN ANIMAL CRUELTY AND THEN THE POTENTIAL. FOR VIOLENCE TOWARDS ON HUMANS WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO SB FIVE EIGHTY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS UNDULY TIES THE HAND OF COURTS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. I'D LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITHOUT AROUND BACK CALL THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEN OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOU -- WHILE IT SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE THE LINKED A UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS -- TO VIOLENCE TOWARD ANIMALS NOT ALL OF THE CRIMES ENUMERATED WITH IN THIS BILL A FOLK THE SAME -- MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS ADDS THAT SOME OF THE OTHERS SPECIFICALLY CRIMES RELATED TO IMPROPERLY CARING FOR ANY ANIMAL OVER WORKING AN ANIMAL OR EVEN INJURING A POLICE DOG MAY NOT BE LINKED TO AN UNDERLYING MENTAL ILLNESS. INTO THE MANDATORY NATURE OF THIS WOULD AND UP UTILIZING COURT RESOURCES TO FIND THAT THERE WAS NOT AN UNDERMINE MENTAL ILLNESS -- ALSO ADDITIONALLY WHEN I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH SOME OF OUR FOLKS ON MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEY WERE SAYING THAT MOST LIKELY WHAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THIS -- IF IT IS A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IS A PERSONALITY DISORDER PARTICULARLY ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER. AND IN CASES WHERE -- MENTAL HEALTH IS SUSPECTED AS THE CAUSE OF THE CRIME AND AB EIGHTEEN TEN LAST YEAR MAN HOW TO VERSION LAW WAS PASSED WITH X. -- THE STATE HAS EXPRESSIVELY EXCLUDED -- ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER AND SO IF THE PERSON'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE VERSION THAN IN THEIR CONVICTED UNDER THIS PSALM ONE OF THESE OFFENSES THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO UNDERGO ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION -- WHICH WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED. WE ALSO -- LIKE TO MENTION THAT THERE IS A CURRENTLY A SHORTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS ABLE TO CONDUCT MENTAL HEALTH OR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER COUNTIES WHERE -- THAT APARTMENTS I REPRESENT ARE THE ONES THAT NORMALLY CONDUCT THE EVALUATIONS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ADD AN UNDUE WORKLOAD -- TO WHAT IS ALREADY AN OVERBURDENED SYSTEM IT WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPETENCY EVALUATIONS THAT -- THE COURTS ARE SEEN AND THE COUNTIES ARE CONDUCTING AN AND WE ARE AS I'M SURE OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL WHERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION WAITING TO GET INTO THE STATE HOSPITALS THAT ARE BEEN DECLARED INCOMPETENT STAND TRIAL. SO WE DID RECEIVE THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE READING THROUGH THEM BUT WE LIKELY WOULD REMAIN OPPOSED AND WE WE APPRECIATE THE ATTEND BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD I AM I THINK WE'RE AN AFTERNOON NOW GOOD AFTERNOON THAT -- LIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS -- FOR THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD -- WE WILL ALSO BE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS -- AND ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. MR COURSE MR CHURKIN. LET ME -- LET ME SAY SOMETHING HERE. FIRST OF ALL. I THINK THAT YOU HAVE -- MOVE THE BILL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I HAD COME PREPARED TO VOTE NO. I THINK YOU MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I CAN'T MAKE AN EVALUATION -- RIGHT NOW BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID. AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST YOU MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL AND TRY AND WORK OUT THE DETAILS -- WITH -- STAFF WITH THE OPPOSITION -- DETAILS LIKE -- HOW? WHAT AT WHAT TIME? DOES A PSYCHOLOGIST BECOME INVOLVED -- THEY THE OPPOSITION IS SAYING IT'S BEST TO HAPPEN BEFORE SENTENCING -- YOU OF CERTAINLY REDUCED BY FAR AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THE NUMBER OF OF OFFENSES. ARE ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T KNOW HOW. HOW MANY THAT IS WHAT THE COST WOULD BE I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC WHAT YOU'VE DONE? I JUST THINK IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO EVALUATE IT. AND IF YOU COULD MAKE THIS A TO YOUR BILL I JUST THINK IT AS A MUCH -- YOU KNOW RATHER THAN HAVE US VOTE NO. ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION WHATEVER -- I JUST THINK MAKING THE TO YOUR BILL WOULD WORK SO THAT'S MY THAT'S MY OFFER. IS THE CHAIR OPEN TO THAT. EXTREMELY OPEN TO THAT. THEN THE BILL BE TESTIMONY ONLY. YEAH I'M FINE WITH A LOT OF A LOT OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE AMENDMENTS AND I FOR ONE UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO SIGN OFF ON SOMETHING WHEN THEY WHEN IT JUST COMES ACROSS OR DOWN SO -- WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO MAKE IT TO YOUR BILL TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS AND WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND GET THIS BILL EXACTLY WHERE WE NEEDED TO BE SO IT BENEFITS -- ANIMALS AND PEOPLE RAINY ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD AS YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO CHAIRS CONCERN IS THE MANDATORY. THANKS AND NOT GIVING JUDGES ENOUGH DISCRETION BUT I THINK. GIVEN TIME WE MAY BE ABLE TO WE GOT THIS FAR BY. TALKING WITH LOW MORE TIME WE PROBABLY GETTING FURTHER. AND WHICH IS WHAT. OUR STEAM KALI HIS SAID THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT. SO I AM I WOULD DISCARDED AS COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE UNLESS MISS COMEDY WHAT. SO IN AND I SUPPORT THIS -- OFFER AND SUPPORT YOUR CONSIDERATION OF IT GEN DID THE LACK OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION WILL PROBABLY BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. JUST AS KIND OF LOOKING AT DEGREES OF NEGLECT AND I CERTAINLY THINK PEOPLE WOULD. QUESTION IF MUTILATING AND TORTURING AND SODOMIZING AN ANIMAL IS THE SAME IS NOT LEAVING THE WINDOW CRACKED IN A RED DRESS HANDS -- AND THEN OVER BURDENING AN ALREADY BROKEN JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH SOME OF THE MANDATORY ELEMENTS -- AS WELL AS FIGURING OUT A WAY TO KIND OF SHARE WHAT THE METRICS WOULD BE FOR EVALUATING YOU KNOW WHEN AN ANIMAL IS OVERWORKED OVERLOADED OVER DRIVEN YOU KNOW I WOULD ARGUE PEOPLE TAKEN AT THE ANIMALS. TO THE BATHROOM IN THE RESTAURANT ALL THAT COULD KIND OF BE CONSIDERED TORTURE BUT I KNOW THAT'S NOT. PART OF THIS. BUT I THINK IF THERE CAN BE WAY IT'S A KIND OF TWEAK THAT WE CAN GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT THIS. IS ABOUT WHICH IS WHEN FOLKS ARE. USING ANIMALS IN DOG FIGHTS IN TORTURING THEM [inaudible] THEY ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT GOING TO HARM AND AND A HUMAN AND THAT IS JUST LET JET -- BUT I WOULD ASK THAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ALSO BE GREAT AND WE WILL DELVE INTO THAT. OKAY THANK THANK YOU SENATOR FOR RECONSIDERATION MEMBERS. SHARE TIME -- SO SB FIVE EIGHT OH IS BEING WITHDRAWN BY. AUTHORED BOOK IS JUST. JUST TESTIMONY ON THAT'S RIGHT TESTIMONIALS I APOLOGIZE.
