00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:07.745
OF TODAY'S HEARING. LAST MONTH

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.313
STATEWIDE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.249
ELECTION RAISE QUESTIONS. ABOUT

00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.784
WHETHER OUR ONE HUNDRED TEN

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:13.851
YEAR OLD RECALL PROCESS WAS THE

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:16.020
FIFTH HAS. SUFFICIENT CHECKS

DEMOCRATIC AND FAIR ELECTIONS.

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:20.992
WELL I BELIEVE THE RECALL IS AN

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.794
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR VOTERS TO

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.662
ADDRESS MISCONDUCT BY ELECTED

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.664
OFFICIALS. I AM TROUBLED BY THE

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.232
FUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.734
NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.636
RECALL PROCESS. AS I'VE

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.404
PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY STATED

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.440
CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD NOT ALLOW

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:36.574
AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TO BE

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.376
RECALLED AND REPLACED BY

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.344
SOMEONE ELSE WHO RECEIVES FAR

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:42.313
FEWER VOTES. BUT IF LAST

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.582
MONTH'S RECALL HAD SUCCEEDED

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.183
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAVE

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.785
HAPPENED. IN FACT GOVERNOR

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:49.754

IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.859
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION WOULD

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:55.960
HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY SOMEONE

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:57.428
WHO RECEIVED FEWER THAN THREE

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:59.096
POINT SIX MILLION VOTES. IN THE

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:01.432
RECALL. IN ADDITION TO THE

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.533
UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.434
CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT RECALL

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.436

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:07.305
CONCERNS THAT THE HYPER

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:09.373
POLARIZATION OF SOCIETY.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.209
COUPLED WITH THE ABNORMALLY LOW

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:12.877
THRESHOLD TO QUALIFY RECALL.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.278
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:15.213
SMALL MINORITIES OF

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.114
CALIFORNIANS TO WEAPONIZE THE

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.816
RECALL PROCESS TO DISRUPT

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:21.118

ABOUT SPECIFIC REFORMS THAT I

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:39.370
MIGHT SUPPORT. BUT I HOPE THAT

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:40.638

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:30.087
TOOL. TO ENSURE THAT LEADERS

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:36.527

VOTERS ADDED THIS PROCEDURE TO

OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. AND IT

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:44.569
IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE MANNER

00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.137
IN WHICH RECALLS ARE CONDUCTED

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.939
IN THE STATE DO NEED TO BE

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:50.074
REVISITED. AND POTENTIALLY

REFORM ACT. THE RECALL IS NOT

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.880
INTENDED AND MUST NOT

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:58.449

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.389
RECALLS WHILE POTENTIALLY

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.725
POSITIVE ARE DISRUPTIVE TO

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.760
GOVERNANCE CAN EXACERBATE

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:13.130

TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALEXION

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:32.083
THIS IS MONEY THAT CALIFORNIANS

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.552
OVERWHELMINGLY AGREE COULD HAVE

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.786

MATTER WHAT WE DO. REFORMING

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:58.809
THE RECALL SHOULD NOT BE A

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:01.479
PARTISAN ISSUE IT SHOULD BE

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:04.315

SUBJECT. MATTER HAVE TO SAY.

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.897
BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.832
BASTION OF CHECKS AND BALANCES

A PATH WHERE WE MAKE IT MORE

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.944
DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO- ACCESS

THAT- YOU KNOW BUT I HAVE

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:12.383

BETTER OUTCOMES- AND THEN- I'M

READ IN THE- LAST FEW WEEKS OF

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:33.604
CONCERN TO ME. ABOUT MAKING

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.940
THIS PROCESS HARDER AND- SOME

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:36.941
OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:39.276
SEEN CAN HAVE THAT BUT THAT

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:42.446
CHILLING EFFECT ON- ACCESS FOR

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:48.119
VOTERS. TO- TO ENACT. OF

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:53.591
SOMETHING THAT WILL- IT I GUESS

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.258
FOR THE BETTER OF FOR LACK OF A

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:57.228
BETTER TERM JUST IF SOMEBODY

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:59.263
HAS MAKING AND MADE A MISTAKE

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.831
AND THEY'VE THEY REALIZE THAT

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.299
THE PERSON THAT THEY ELECTED IS

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.168
NOT WHO THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE-

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.836
THEY SHOULD HAVE A RECALL

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.338
PROCESS FOR THAT CHECKS AND

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:10.141
BALANCES AND SO I LOOK FORWARD

AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.945
I'VE ALREADY BEEN TWO HEARINGS

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:48.579
ALREADY WITH THE LITTLE HOOVER

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.815
COMMISSION ON THE SUBJECT

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:53.751
MATTER I WANT TO MAKE IT.

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:57.454
COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS. NUMBER

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:58.823
ONE I THINK THERE IS A VALID

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:03.227
QUESTION. OF THE MERIT. IN A

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:07.631
CHANGE. IN THE PROCESS AND

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:08.666
THAT'S BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:12.436
THAT IT HAS BEEN SO SELDOM USED.

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:16.307
AND ONLY TWICE SIX ROUGHLY. AT

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:25.182
THE GUBERNATORIAL LEVEL. I WANT

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:28.285
TO PREFACE MY REMARKS AND NOT

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:34.325
LIMITLESS THIS IS NOT WORKING.

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:38.863
I GOT I'VE TRIED GET. GET IT

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:47.271
GET A THAT STAY UP ME HERE. NO

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.839
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE LET'S

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.875
START OFF WITH POLLING I KNOW

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:51.542
THERE'S BEEN PULLING OVER A

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:55.446
PERIOD OF TIME. ON THIS ISSUE.

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.147
BUT I'VE ASKED THE QUESTION.

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:59.183
HAS THAT POLLING INCLUDED IN

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.186
THE QUESTION. THE LACK OF

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:05.723
SUCCESS AND THE FREQUENCY OVER

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:08.559
A HUNDRED YEARS. I THINK THAT'S

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.895
NOT THE CASE THAT IF IT IS ANY

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:14.999
FUTURE POLLING MUST INCLUDE.

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:17.668
THAT REFERENCE FOR CONTEXT. IN

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:20.838
WHETHER OR NOT. AND I THINK

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.207
THAT WOULD BE A FAILING OF PAST.

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:28.679
POLLING FURTHER. JUST THE

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.381
AVALANCHE OF HISTORY IN

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:33.984
CALIFORNIA. ONE OF LATE IS

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:37.955
BROKEN SO BADLY. CAN THERE BE

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:41.125
SOME CHANGES YES I THINK THERE

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:43.127
CAN BE AND I'M HAPPY TO

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:46.096
ENTERTAIN THAT. BUT SIGNIFICANT

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:50.534
CHANGES I DON'T THINK SO. THE

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:51.802
INITIATIVE AND THE REFERENDUM

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.938
THE RECALL A VERY SACRED DIRECT

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:56.373
DEMOCRACY OPPORTUNITIES REALLY

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.276
PERFECTED IN THE STATE. AND

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:02.346
UNLIKE THE C. NOT TRIVIALIZE

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:05.883
THOSE. AND THERE'S ONE ISSUE

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.251
THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:10.788
CONSIDERATION TODAY. AND THAT

00:43:10.854 --> 00:43:14.992
IS CAMPAIGN FUNDING LIMITS. FOR

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.361
ALL PARTIES. THAT IS NOT NOW

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.997
THE CASE. THEN WE'VE SEEN VERY

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:25.703
DISPROPORTIONATE CONTRIBUTION.

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:28.405
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.774
CARES THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:32.910
HEARING IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.945
CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION. BUT

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.948
I'M GOING TO BE VERY RELUCTANT.

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:38.382
TO DO ANYTHING THAT

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:42.119
COMPROMISES. THE CITIZENS RIGHT

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:42.619
TO DIRECTLY AFFECT THEIR

00:43:42.686 --> 00:43:45.622
FUTURES. AND WE DO NEED TO PAY

HEED TOM DEGREE TO LOCAL

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:50.127

GOVERNMENT FOLKS MUCH

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:54.398
REPRESENTED HERE. AND NOR DO I

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:57.101
FIND SOME. TRADITIONAL

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:59.937
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO NOT

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.839
SUPPORT THE TAMPERING OR THE

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:06.343
CHANGES THE RECALL PROCESS IT

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.011
WOULD APPEAR TO ME THAT MOST

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:10.114
WITNESSES OR AT LEAST DISPOSED

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.417
MORE TOWARDS. CHANGE THEN

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:16.120
OPPOSED TO CHANGE. AND THAT

GOVERNMENT AND IN THE RECALL

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:25.863
PROCESS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.164
LEVEL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE-

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.132
PLAN TO LOOK AT A FUTURE

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:30.801

YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.076
REMARKS. JUST VERY BRIEFLY.

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:42.212
MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR.

PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.851
HEAR FROM SOME EXPERTS. I THINK

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:49.853
IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. SOME FOR

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.522
REFORM IS NEEDED I'M INTERESTED

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.690
IN HEARING THE IDEAS TODAY BUT

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:55.059
ULTIMATELY WHATEVER CHANGES

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.593
PROPOSED HAS TO PASS MUSTER

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.128
WITH THE VOTERS. I THINK VERY

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:00.097
CLEARLY WANT TO MAINTAIN. A

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.598
RECALL PROCESS BUT IF THERE'S A

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:04.635
WAY TO SIMPLIFY. THE PROCESS

00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:06.003
MAKE IT'LL ACTUALLY LOOK MORE.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.838
CLEAR FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:10.107
I'D I'D BE. OPEN TO THAT I BE

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.375
PREDISPOSED TO THAT I AM MOST

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:13.644
INTRIGUED I WOULD SAY- BY THE

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.446
SIMPLICITY OF A LIEUTENANT

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:16.380
GOVERNOR SENDING TO THE

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:19.883
GOVERNORSHIP. UPON A RECALL-

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.818
YET SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.454
RAISED. ABOUT SOME PERVERSE

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.322
INCENTIVES LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.924
OF A DIFFERENT PARTY PERHAPS-

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.826
WORKING TO A WORKING WITH

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:29.927
RECALL PROPONENTS TO HAVE A

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.395
GOVERNOR RECALL SO THAT

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:31.929
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR COULD

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:34.064
ASCEND. ALL ONE WAY TO ADDRESS

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.732
THAT IS IF WE JOIN THE TWENTY

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.568
SIX. OTHER STATES WHERE THE

00:45:37.634 --> 00:45:38.769
GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:40.437
GOVERNOR ARE A TICKET. THEY ARE

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:41.505
THE SAME ADMINISTRATION OF THE

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.706
SAME PARTY SO IF THERE IS A

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.675
REMOVAL OF THE GOVERNOR. UPON

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.310
RECALL THE RESIGNATION THERE'S

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.978
A CLEAR LINE OF SUCCESSION

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:48.812
THERE'S CONTINUITY OF

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.047
GOVERNMENT THEY ARE PART OF THE

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:52.149
SAME ADMINISTRATION. WE SAW AN

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.083
EXAMPLE IN NEW YORK NOT A

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.352
RECALL. ABOUT A RESIGNATION BUT

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.254
A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. OF IT OF

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:58.355
THE SAME TICKET OF THE SAME

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.256
PARTY OF THE SAME

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:00.357
ADMINISTRATION ASCENDED TO THE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.692
GOVERNORSHIP SO THERE'S A WAY

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:02.493
TO LOOK AT THE LINE OF

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:04.061
SUCCESSION. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.596
DIRECTLY RELATED TO RECALL

00:46:05.662 --> 00:46:08.298
REFORM IT'S ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.967
TO- CREATING A STRUCTURE. OF

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:11.969
THAT MAKE SENSE IN THE RARE

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:14.037
OCCURRENCE OF A- OF A GOVERNOR

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.205
BEING RECALL BUT I LOOK FORWARD

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.106
TO HEARING ALL THE IDEAS IN

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.574
FACT MR STERN BOB STERN IS

ONLY JUST IN TERMS OF THE

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.828

NEVER BE INTO THE INTO THE

GOVERNOR GAVE US THE PROCESS

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:03.066
ITSELF WAS COMPLETED IN UNDER

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.301
FOUR MONTHS. WHICH IS A WITH

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:05.736
VOICE STATE THE SIZE IT IS

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:07.637
DIFFICULT TO RUN SUCH ELECTION.

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:09.339
WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES OF ALL

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.608
THE CONCERNS- IN THAT SHORT

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.876
PERIOD OF TIME. SOME OF YOU

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:14.378
KNOW THAT EVEN DOWN TO SOME OF

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:15.679
THE SMALLEST DETAILS WHICH IS

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:17.247
ACTUALLY THE DETAILS. OF

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.616
FINDING PAPER ADEQUATE PAPER TO

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.118
RUN THE BALLOTS ON AND TO SEND

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:23.220
OUT THE- THE INFORMATION WAS A

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.955
WAS A MAJOR CHALLENGE- THAT

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:26.390
FORTUNATELY BECAUSE THOSE WHO

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.991
HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE NEW ABOUT

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:30.494
IT. BEGIN WORKING EARLY- FOR

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.294
FEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE A

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:32.596
RECALL AND THEREFORE WE WERE

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.531
ABLE TO SECURE SOME VENDORS TO

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:35.932
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT. THE

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.868
RECALL LISTEN- WAS ESTABLISHED

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.870
A PROCESS IN NINETEEN ELEVEN

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.705
IT'S IN AND HOLDING TEN YEARS

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:42.939
IN THE AND REMARKABLY THERE'S

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:45.075
ONLY. MINOR CHANGES IN THE

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:47.377
RECALL ELECTION PROCESS. ARE WE

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:48.812
LIVING IN SOMEONE HISTORIC TIME

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:49.813
SINCE THE RECENT RECALL

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.648
ELECTION. IS ONLY THE SECOND

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.650
TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:54.751
THE STATEWIDE RECALL HAS

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:56.653
QUALIFIED AND RESULTED IN AN

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.322
ELECTION. THE FIRST WAS IN TWO

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:00.824
THOUSAND AND THREE AND WITH THE

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.959
RESULT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS.

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:03.994
I THINK THIS GIVES US AN

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.562
OPPORTUNITY ASK PEOPLE HAD SAID

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.564
THEY WOULD DO IN TWO THOUSAND

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:08.131
THREE TO REFLECT ON HOW THE

00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:09.766
PROCESS WORKS. AND WHETHER THAT

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.468
WORKS WELL FOR CALIFORNIA. IT

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.236
GIVES US THAT AND THE PUBLIC IN

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:14.538
THE LEGISLATURE AND ELECTED

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:15.672
OFFICIALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:24.214
REVIEW. AND CHANGE OR REFINE

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.549
THE PROCESS THERE. I DON'T

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:26.550
THINK WE NECESSARY HAVE ALL THE

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:28.285
IN. THAT FAR AND OF ASKED ME

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:29.753
TO. DO THEM WHAT I WE SHOULD DO

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.353
AND I STILL. CA TO THE FACT

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.087
THAT IT SHOULD BE A

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.055
CONVERSATION WATER JUST MY- IT

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.891
SHOULD BE A COME. AMONG AND

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.059
THAT SO WE SHOULD BE ASKING

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:37.661
SOME CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:40.363
THE PROCESS ITSELF- IS IT FAIR

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:41.631
TO THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW IS IT

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.033
FAIR TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.768
WE ARE BASICALLY. ENGAGED IN

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:45.969
THIS PROCESS AFTER THE PUBLIC

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.704
IS DECIDED WHO THEY WANTED TO

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.673
BE ELECTED. AND WE'RE ABLE TO

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.775
BASICALLY MAKE A CHANGE WITH A

00:51:51.842 --> 00:51:53.410
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:56.112
WILL RAISE THE ISSUE- IS IT. AS

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.681
A SAID IS IT FAIR TO ALL VOTERS

00:51:57.747 --> 00:51:58.782
NOT JUST THE PUBLIC BUT THOSE

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.317
WHO ACTUALLY THOUGHT. I HAD

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:02.252
MANY VOTERS CONTACTED MY OFFICE

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.587
SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:04.754
IT WAS FAIR THEY WANT TO KNOW

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.056
WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. IT WAS

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.557
JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:08.825
PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANTED THIS

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.427
AND WHY WE ENGAGE IN THIS

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:12.829
PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA- IS A

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.264
GOOD FOR THE PROPONENTS ALSO

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.099
WANT TO RECALL. ARE YOU KNOW

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.168
SOMEONE ARGUED THAT THEY MADE

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.302
THAT THEY ALSO WANT TO RECALL

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.303
AND REALLY THEY ALSO HAVE ALL

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.571
THE RESOURCES. TO MAKE THE

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:23.006
RECALL HAPPENED THAT THE WHOLE

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:24.641
IDEA OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT. THAT

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.443
THIS IS THE DESIGN TO DO TO

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.677
MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAD A

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:28.745
VOICE. BUT THAT VOICE NOW IS

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.814
BEING DRIVEN BY MONEY MUCH MORE

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:31.615
THAN ANY OTHER THING WITH

00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:33.116
REGARDS TO THE INITIATIVE TO

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:34.384
GET TO THE BALLOT. AND THE

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:37.220
RECALL IS ONE OF THOSE- WHEN WE

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:38.855
TALK ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THE

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.423
SUBJECT ITSELF IT'S A FAIR TO

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.424
ACTUALLY RECALL OF AN

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:43.093
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN ALREADY

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:44.494
ELECTRIC. AND THERE ISN'T AN

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.096
OUTPOURING OF INDIVIDUALS TO

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.898
MAKE THAT CHANGE AND IS IT FAIR

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.332
TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. WHO

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.201
CAN ACTUALLY BE RECALL FOR ANY

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.703
REASON- AND I SOMETIMES WITHOUT

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.338
REASON BECAUSE CONSISTENTLY I

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.274
WAS ASKED. TELL CAN YOU TELL ME

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.842
THE SPECIFIC REASONS THAT THE

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.343
LAW THAT THIS PERSON BROKE.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.778
THAT THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.847
CREATED WHAT ARE THAT YOU KNOW

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.048
WHAT WHAT LOST BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:53:05.115 --> 00:53:06.016
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE CUSTOM THE

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:07.584
FACT. THAT THERE IS SOMETHING

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.885
THAT YOU DID WRONG THAT THERE

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.954
WAS SOMEHOW YOU VIOLATED. YOUR

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:12.389
CODE OF CONDUCT YOUR YOUR YOUR

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.524
THE CODE OF CONDUCT OR THE LAWS

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:15.959
THAT WERE IN PLACE WHAT LAW WAS

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:24.034
BROKEN. AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:24.968
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BE BECAUSE

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.103
IT WOULDN'T APPLY. BROKEN AND

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.138
IT SAYS IN A LOW THAT YOU CAN

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:29.940
RECALL PERSON. YOU CAN. THE

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:31.107
REASONS WITH THOSE THREE. CAN

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.809
NOW BE LIVING. HE NEVER READ

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:33.877
THAT. BY ANYONE ELSE AND SO

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.745
THEREFORE. YOU'RE TO DO THAT SO

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:37.113
IT MAY WAYS WE LOOK AT THE- AND

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.882
WE START AS A C. CLAUS. WAS A

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:42.552
CALL. KA IN. DO EIGHT RECALL

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:43.753
ELECTION- THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.988
DOLLAR AND I WOULDN'T. ARGUE

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:46.323
THAT THE MARK. HAS A COST TO IT

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.291
BECAUSE FAIRNESS IN THE BAR.

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.492
HAS NO. AND IT'S WORTH THE-

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:52.295
LEVEL PAY. TO MAKE. IT BUT WHEN

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:54.831
WE ASKED SOME THE OTHER- IT FOR

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.132
THE WEB WITH THE GUY. TO THE

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:58.001
MID. OF THE COUNTY. OFFICIALS

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.203
TO. THE IN THE- THAT WILL.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.171
DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE YES.

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:03.573
THAT FROM. US BECAUSEMANY OF

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.475
THEM HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY.

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.210
IT HAD NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY. ARE

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.979
HANDLED IN THE IN THE COURTS OR

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:10.680
EVEN IN THE LEGISLATION THAT

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.182
EXISTENCE ITSELF. THIS PRODUCED

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:14.050
A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LAWSUITS

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.785
FOR US. IN OUR OFFICE IN FACT

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.554
WE STILL HAVE SOME THAT REMAIN

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:19.389
TODAY. UP IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL-

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.124
WHO MEDICAID IT WANTED TO

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.592
DISCUSS THE RECALL AND WHETHER

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:23.727
NOT THIS. THIS WAS A FAIR AND

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.929
JUST PROCESS. MY ONLY CONCERN

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:26.763
WITH A LOT OF THEM WAS THAT WHY

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.597
DID YOU TELL ME THIS IN

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.366
ADVANCE. IF YOU HAVE SOME

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.767
CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS.%

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.168
CONCERNING RECALLS THIS IS

00:54:32.235 --> 00:54:33.036
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.804
HAD LOTS OF US. AND HAVE THE

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:36.406
COURTS WEIGH IN ON IT SO EVEN

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:37.907
WITH GOOD REASONS AND GOOD

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.609
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:41.011
BEFORE US. THE TIME FRAME WAS

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.979
SO SHORT. THAT WE COULD NOT

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.948
SPEND OUR TIME BATTLING THIS

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.950
PIECE OF LET LEGISLATION WITH

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:48.752
THIS LOSS OF THAT WAS THERE. MY

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:49.886
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE FACT

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:50.920
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO GET

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.255
IT DONE. AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.791
NORMAL PROCESS. OF LITIGATION

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:56.059
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BEYOND

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.761
THE DATE FOR THE RECALL FAR

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:59.329
BEYOND EVEN THE PRIMARY THAT WE

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.530
WERE ENGAGED. AND SO I

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:02.065
APPRECIATED MANY OF THE-

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.700
SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD AND CAME

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.802
UP WITH WONDERFUL DISCUSSIONS.

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:06.803
ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.772
CONSTITUTIONAL. CAN WE ACTUALLY

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:10.540
DO THERE'S A THERE'S A VIOLATE

00:55:10.607 --> 00:55:16.646
THE BASIC. ALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.148
THE VOTES. THOSE A WONDERFUL

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.616
DISCUSSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:20.984
TIME FOR IT. THERE WAS NO

00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:22.118
OPPORTUNITY FOR AND I WISH

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:24.254
THOSE. WHO HAVE SAID IN TWO

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.955
THOUSAND THREE. WHEN WE HAD

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.257
MANY OF THE CASES DECADES FOR

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:29.059
THE BURDEN VERSUS SHELLEY CASE.

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.560
I WISH THEY HAD BASICALLY TO

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:33.363
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT. IN TWO

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.864
THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:36.032
FIVE OR SIX. SO THAT WE COULD

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.001
THEN HAVE BETTER GUIDANCE WITH

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:39.602
REGARDS TO IT SO. WE COULD NOT

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:40.804
HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.971
GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF THE-

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.840
LEGISLATION ITSELF AS TO WHAT

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:46.009
IS REQUIRED- WE COULD WE HAD TO

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.511
TEAT THIS GENERAL ELECTION-

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:49.446
AND THAT REALLY WAS ALMOST LIKE

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.281
A PRIMARY. I COULD DO ELECTION.

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.215
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SECOND

00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:53.616
ELECTION TO BE HELD IN SO ALL

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.118
OF THESE THINGS. CREATED

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:57.120
DIFFICULTY FOR THOSE WHO WERE.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.488
TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.023
THOSE MUSCLE IMPLEMENTING IT.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.091
AND THEN THOSE SCHOLARS WHO

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:02.459
BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THE

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:03.827
WHOLE CONCEPT. OF THAT THERE

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:05.395
SHOULD BE A MAJORITY VOTE IN

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.130
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ARE WE

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.598
HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:10.366
THAT CAME FORWARD TO US ALL OF

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:11.901
THEM. YOU HAVE INDICATED IN

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.536
YOUR OWN. A MATERIAL THAT YOU

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.071
PUT OUT IN TERMS OF. WHAT IS

00:56:15.138 --> 00:56:16.606
APPROPRIATE AND INAPPROPRIATE

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:17.907
AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING.

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:19.075
KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF THESE

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.710
RECOMMENDATIONS AS ONE THAT WAS

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.178
JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO.

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:24.047
REQUIRE MAJOR CHANGE. BECAUSE

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.315
WE'VE GROWN FROM ARLINGTON A

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:26.616
GOVERNOR THAT SHE IS NOT WHO

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:27.851
DOESN'T WANT TO BE THAT. THE

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.086
PERSON STEPS IN AND- OUT BUT AT

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.155
THE SAME TIME- WHAT HAPPENS IF

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.556
THERE IS TWO PARTIES IN THE AND

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:34.691
THE DIFFICULTY THAT MIGHT

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:35.992
EXIST. BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT

00:56:36.059 --> 00:56:38.094
PARTIES THAT REQUIRES US TO

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.095
REALLY LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.830
OUR PROCESS. AND TO MAKE SURE

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:43.633
THAT- OF. THE ACT WE ARE

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.635
WILLING TO GO THE FULL WAY IN

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:46.836
TERMS OF MAKING A CHANGE THAT

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:47.804
WOULD THAT WOULD BE CORRECTIVE

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:49.539
SO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.307
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES. IF WE

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:52.642
START DOWN THIS PATH WITHOUT

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.244
REALLY GIVING CAREFUL THOUGHT.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.045
THE OUTCOMES OF EVERY ACTION

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:58.148
THAT WE TAKE. ARM HOLDING A

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.549
STATE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT. AND

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:01.384
HOW WE'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.986
ELECTIONS AND- AND AFTER THAT

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:04.821
COUNTIES WILL BE A STRONG AND A

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:05.822
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES CAME

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.190
THROUGH WITH THAT. BASICALLY

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:09.225
OPERATED OF ELECTION IN A VERY

00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:10.894
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT ALL

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.428
OF US HAD GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:21.538
QUALIFICATIONS OF. OF

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:22.105
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RUNNING

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.740
THE QUALIFICATIONS OF. SIMPLE

00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:24.474
BUT THERE WERE NO BETTER

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:25.842
PROCESS THAT WAS NO. NO FOR THE

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.810
PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY HEAR THE IN

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.645
THE- TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE.

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.279
WITH THE FIFTH LARGE ECONOMY IN

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.113
THE- IN WILL. AT CHANGE THE

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.514
DUMP. WITH SOMEONE COULD HAPPEN

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.116
LITTLE AS- FIRST. OF THAT IN

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.851
AND THE ONLY WE KNOW SURE. THAT

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:36.252
MOST FOLKS OVER THE- THAT IF WE

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.720
REMOVE THIS GOT. IT IS CLEAR WE

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:38.588
WILL HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO DOES

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.523
NOT HAVE TO WITHDRAW. VOTE ARE

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.991
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY GIVEN

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:43.226
ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE TAKING

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.527
PLACE IN THE SHORT TIME FRAME.

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:45.662
WOULD REPAIR THAT WE HAVE AN

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.497
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. SO THERE

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.832
ARE OTHER OPTIONS AND WE MUST

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:50.066
CONSIDER I THINK IT IS

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.301
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:53.002
LOOK AT THE STATE. THAT WE LOOK

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:55.271
AT- THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TWO

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:56.272
SEPARATE ELECTIONS AND SOME

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.440
PEOPLE TALK WITH THAT IS.

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.709
SPREAD OUT OVER MORE TIME IN

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.811
TERMS OF DOING RECALL ELECTED

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.613
TO SELECT A REPLACEMENT. ALL

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.248
THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE THOUGHT

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:06.349
OUT AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN THE

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:07.784
TIME FRAME BECAUSE KEEP IN

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:08.985
MIND. OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS A

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.653
CERTAIN FROM FOR YEARS. SO BY

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.255
THE TIME WE GET TO THE POINT OF

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:13.623
RECALLS. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.991
LOT OF TIME LEFT IN THEIR IN

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.326
THEIR OFFICE AND THAT WAS ONE

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:17.660
OF THE CONCERNS PEOPLE REYES.

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:18.194
SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:19.429
RECALL ELECTION SB IN

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.197
SEPTEMBER. THEY WERE GOING TO

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.999
BASICALLY. THAT ONCE AGAIN HAVE

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:24.234
ANOTHER ELECTION CONCERNING

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.336
THIS PERSON IN ANOTHER NINE

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:27.570
MONTHS AND WATER. WELL LET'S

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:29.005
PEOPLE SAID WHAT A WASTE OF

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.673
RESOURCES. NONETHELESS IT IS

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.075
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BECAUSE WE

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.843
DON'T WITH THE ISSUE SO. LET ME

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.811
SAY THAT IN CLOSING I KNOW MY

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.680
TIME IS UP- THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.082
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:40.416
WITH REGARDS TO THIS THAT WE

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:41.484
COOK. IT IS CLEAR THE

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.753
CALIFORNIANS WANT A PROCESS OF

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.155
ENGAGEMENT LIKE RECALL OR OR OR

00:58:46.222 --> 00:58:47.957
HAVING PETITIONS BUT- AND THIS

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.225
IS PUT ON BALLOTS THEY THEY

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.960
WANT THIS PROCESS. EVEN NO

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.896
MATTER HOW FLAWED IT IS THAT

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:53.997
THEY WANT. BUT IT CAN'T BE A

00:58:54.063 --> 00:58:55.465
WHOLE LOT EASIER AND I THINK

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:56.766
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.635
THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO HAVE.

00:58:58.701 --> 00:58:59.836
MORE TEETH TO- THERE HAS TO BE

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.304
MORE DIRECTION TO WHAT. I

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:02.805
PERSONALLY CONSULTING WITH A

00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.440
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.609
CONSTITUTIONAL. ATTORNEYS AS

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:08.211
WELL AS THOSE WHO BEEN IN

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:09.946
POLITICAL OFFICE ON BOTH SIDES

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:11.481
OF. THE AISLE TO ASK THEM

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.916
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:24.494
BE DOING CONCERNED. WE CALL.

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.161
AND WE WILL. AB HOPEFULLY WE IN

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:25.762
WITH YOUR REGULAR. CONCERNING

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:26.529
WHAT WE SEE. AS THOSE WORDS. OF

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:27.697
THE ELECT. AND NOT JUST MYSELF.

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.265
BUT THE RED STROBE. UP AND- THE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.867
STATE. AS TO WHAT WOULD MAKE IT

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:33.036
A FAIR. CLEAR ACROSS. SINCE

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.971
PEOPLE. PURCHASE IN. AND TO DO

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:36.039
THIS. KEEP IN MIND THAT. THOUGH

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.707
WE ONLY SEEN A FEW. IN TERMS OF

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:39.609
THE- PLEASE. WE ARE SEEING A-

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.010
OF RECALL ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:41.744
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:43.579
THAT WERE WE TO SEE IT. NOW AND

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:47.116
THEN. WE STILL WE HAVE I THINK

00:59:47.183 --> 00:59:47.850
FIVE SIX SEVEN OF THOSE THIS

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:50.019
YEAR. WE HAVE ANOTHER FORTY

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:51.921
YEARS UP TO GOAL. ARE WE WOULD

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.122
HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WILL BE

00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:54.357
COMING IN AND WE HAVE RECALLS

00:59:54.424 --> 01:00:02.699
PREPARE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:05.735
VERSUS COUNTY VERSES. OF VERSUS

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:06.602
STATE IN TERMS OF

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.304
QUALIFICATIONS FOR BALLOTS.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.973
ASKED WITH FINDING THAT PEOPLE

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.908
HAVE DONE. SIX SIX MONTHS IN

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.509
OFFICE AND IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.811
WANT TO RECALL THEM. AND THE

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.245
PEOPLE WANT TO CALL THEM OF THE

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:17.113
SAME PEOPLE WHO VOTE. WITHIN

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.014
BOTH OF THEM IN THE FIRST

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.849
PLACE. SO THIS IS BECOME AN

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.784
ISSUE. AND IT GOES ON AND ON

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.086
AND I'VE SEEN FOLKS WITH TWO

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:24.354
DIFFERENT RECALL PETITIONS

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.689
AGAINST THEM. ALREADY AND SO IT

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.858
HAS BECOME. A GREAT CONCERN IN

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.326
MY MIND SIMPLY BECAUSE THE

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.894
PEOPLE ARE USING THIS. TO GET

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.563
AROUND THE PROCESS THAT

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:35.198
IMMEDIATELY. THEY THEY GO TO

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.833
RECALL. AND IF AND IF THE

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.634
RESOURCE IS A RIGHT IN TERMS OF

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.269
THE MONEY TO. FOR THOSE WHO CAN

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:41.804
COLLECT PETITIONS. ASSIGNED

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.406
POSITIONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. WE

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.640
DISCOVER THAT RECALLS ARE

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:46.509
OCCURRING SO I AM CONCERNED.

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.177
THAT MANY RECALLS ARE CURRENT

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.512
SCHOOL BOARD'S BOARD OF

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.781
SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCILS. OF

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.149
SEVERAL IN MY CITY OF SAN

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.951
DIEGO. HE WAS ADOPTED FOR

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:55.718
RECALLS THAT THEY NEVER WOULD

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.153
HAVE TAKEN OUT SOME YEARS AGO.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.155
SO NOW WE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.623
THE QUESTION. THAT THIS THING

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.358
THAT WAS ONCE A VERY RARE. AND

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.727
UNUSUAL IS BECOMING THE NORM.

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.129
AND WE WANTED TO BECOME THE

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.930
NORM. BECAUSE IF WE DEAL THEN

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.766
WAS SOMEHOW THE CONSTANTLY.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.801
ATTACKING IN INVALIDATING

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:12.969
ELECTIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED.

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:14.604
ONLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DECIDE

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.272
THEY DON'T LIKE A DECISION THAT

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.273
WAS MADE. WE DON'T HAVE A

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.242
REASON FOR. MY OFTENTIMES

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.109
PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO ME

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.778
CONSISTENTLY. YOU'VE ALSO GOT A

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.179
PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.782
BRING THE CHARGES. IN CONCERNS.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.884
ARE AND- AND THEN AS BASED ON

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.619
THAT ARE NOT TO MOVE FORWARD

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.254
WITH THE PURCHASE. OF THAT

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.889
TAKES TIME TO. AND BUT

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.756
NONETHELESS FOLKS FEEL THAT

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.258
MAYBE. BECAUSE IT IS AN

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.325
EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAPPEN

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.127
THIS RECALL. SO ONCE AGAIN

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.695
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND-

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.064
PREPARED AS ANYONE HAS A

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.832
QUESTION- I DON'T HAVE. THE

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.534
ANSWER TO. THESE QUESTIONS BUT

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.635
I DO KNOW. THAT THERE ARE A LOT

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.003
OF CONCERNS ABOUT OUR RECALL

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.471
PROCESS AND WHILE PEOPLE ARE

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:49.806
THINKING ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:50.940
MOVE FORWARD WITH MAKING SOME

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:52.542
OF THE NATION'S UNLIKE WE DID

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:53.543

EIGHT THE CLERKS AND REGISTRARS

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.543
AROUND THE STATE. WHO REALLY

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.145
HAD TO WORK VERY VERY HARD TO

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.480
MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTION.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:31.914
WAS DONE APPROPRIATELY AND IT

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.317
WAS DONE FAIRLY. HONESTLY AND

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:36.018
APPROPRIATELY AND WE'RE VERY

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.553
VERY GRATEFUL. COLLEAGUES WANT

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.655
TO SEE. QUESTIONS FOR THE

NUMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. NOW YES

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:52.068
SIR OKAY- SECTOR WEBER YOU AND

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.070
TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.906
RECALLS THAT ARE ARE HAPPENING

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:59.709
AND SOME RESEARCH INDICATES I

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.911
WE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.180
NINE ATTEMPTS SINCE NINETEEN

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.215
THIRTEEN THANKS CORRECT. STE

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:08.217
YES I THINK SO YES OKAY AND OF

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.853
THOSE ATTEMPTS. ELEVEN

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.790
QUALIFIED FOR BALLOT. RIGHT SO

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.492
TAKING OUT PAPERS TO DO A

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.227
RECALL DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO A

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.897
RECALL EFFORT AND IT DOESN'T

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.833
TRANSLATE INTO THE COSTS THAT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.668
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MUCH OF

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.904
WHICH IS THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.506
WHICH IS THE MAILIN BALLOTS- I

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.107
BELIEVE THOSE ARE WHAT THREE

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.643
DOLLARS APIECE TO SEND OUT. AND

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:37.346
GET BACK. YES YEAH. SO WHAT WE

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.949
HAVE 51% TURNOUT THAT MEANS 49%

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:43.319
OF THOSE BALLOTS- WERE

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.555
ESSENTIALLY NOT USED. IN

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:48.791
ANOTHER 58% TURNOUT FIFTY EIGHT

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.127
PERCENT. NOW INCLUDES 42% OF

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:53.196
THOSE WEREN'T USED WHICH IS

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:55.431
ADDING TO THE COST SO I SHARE

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:59.202
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING TO-

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.703
TWO SEPARATE ELECTIONS BECAUSE

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.071
THAT'S JUST DOUBLING THE AMOUNT

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:04.407
OF. OF COSTLY HABIT SOME OF

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.210
THAT IS SELF INFLICTED. SOME OF

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:09.645
THOSE- THEY QUALIFIED ABOUT TWO

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:10.179
OF THEM WERE FOR GOVERNOR

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:14.250
CORRECT. YES SO THOSE TO MISTER

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.018
DAVIS BACK GOVERNOR DAVIS AND

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.487
THEN THIS ONE. AND THIS ONE

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.323
PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:22.925
QUALIFIED IF THE JUDICIARY

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:25.728
SYSTEM DIDN'T REQUIRE AN

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:29.699
ADDITIONAL. I THINK IT WAS FOR

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.867
THREE MONTHS- HELP YEAH TWENTY

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:34.103
DAYS. YES SO THIS ONE WOULDN'T

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.472
QUALIFY TO DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.808
IT'S AN EASY PROCESS AT ALL. IT

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:39.308
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A VERY

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.612
DIFFICULT PROCESS. I WOULD

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:44.080
NEVER SAY IT YOU'RE RIGHT

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.481
YOU'RE CORRECT I NEVER SAY THAT

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.849
THAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:49.552
EASY IT IS MADE EASIER BY THOSE

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:51.053
WHO CAN HIRE PEOPLE TO COLLECT

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.388
SIGNATURES IS NO QUESTION ABOUT

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.290
THAT ALL BUT IT'S NOT AN EASY

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.625
PROCESS BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:56.759
TO COLLECT THE SIGNATURES AND

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.027
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO COLLECT

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.462
SIGNATURES YES AND IT LOOKS

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:01.697
LIKE ELEVEN ELEVEN TIMES IN A

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.499
HUNDRED YEARS. THAT HAPPENED

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.567
THEY WERE ABLE TO COLLECT

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.869
ENOUGH SIGNATURES SO THAT'S

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.234
THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.802
LOCAL RACES THAT ARE UP. FOR

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:28.904
GRABS SO TO SPEAK- SUBJECT TO

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.885
TO ACQUIRE THOSE SIGNATURES. OR

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.320
SOMEHOW REDUCE THE COST TO THE

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:49.325
PUBLIC. TO CARRY OUT THE RECALL

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:50.860

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.861
THOSE WHO WANT TO. THE SHOULD

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:54.096
IT. THE OTHER END OF THE- THERE

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.898
SHOULD BE SOME SOLID EVIDENCE

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.867
OF MALFEASANCE OF THE- WHICH

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:01.136

DIDN'T GET A MAJORITY OF THE

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.686
VOTE. A REAL SHORTFALL I THINK

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.021
IN TODAY'S SYSTEM IS THAT AN

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.422

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:23.692
FRACTION OF THE VOTE COMPARED

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.160

FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.605
HER NAME ON THE BALLOT- THEY-

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.040
THEY BECOME THE WINNING OPTIONS

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:40.776
SO TO SPEAK WITH TWENTY OR 30%

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.144
OF THE VOTE. A CORRECTION TO

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.313
THIS COULD BE TO HAVE. TO SEE

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.115
ELECTION PROCESS IN WHICH THE

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.783
RECALL INCUMBENT RUNS AGAINST

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.318
THE TOP VOTE GETTER OF THE

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.886
CHALLENGERS ANY SUBSEQUENT

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.621
ELECTION. THAT'S MORE TIME MORE

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:55.124
COST. OF I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.660
THIS- JUST TRYING TO THINK. OF

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:58.894
THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT WERE

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:01.163
PROCESS. FROM THE PUBLIC- WHO

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.432
REALLY. ARE PRESUMABLY WANTS

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:06.035
CHANGES. BACK TO RECALL. THE

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:08.837
JURY ORDERS FOR THE RECALL AND-

INDISCRIMINATE DATA PUBLIC

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:13.709
THAT'S ALSO RUNNING OUT OF

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.177
PATIENCE. I'M OPTION BE ROUGHLY

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:18.314
BE ALLOW THE BRIEF. I'VE GOT TO

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.115
APPEAR ON A SECOND QUESTION ON

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.217
THE RECALL BALLOT. IF YOU'RE C.

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.485

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.087
SECOND QUESTION HERE SHE STAYS

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:28.591
IN OFFICE- ANOTHER SUGGESTION.

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.925
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THE

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.627
GUBERNATORIAL RECALL IS TO HAVE

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:32.895
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LIEUTENANT

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:33.862
GOVERNOR REQUESTED CHECK IT IN

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.732
THE FIRST PLACE IT'S BEEN

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.100
SUGGESTED- IF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.535
RECALLED. GOVERNOR BECOMES

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.104
GOVERNOR. BUT THAT MISSES THE

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.339
POINT THAT IF THE CONTENT

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.407
GOVERNOR'S SAME PARTY AS THE

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:48.444
RECALL ELECTED NEW GOVERNOR

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.446
MUCH OF THE- PUBLIC WILL SAY

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:54.416
THIS CONTINUES THE SAME. POLICY

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:54.917
AS GOVERNOR WHO WAS JUST

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.952
RECALLED. THE GOAL SHOULD BE TO

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.121
ENCOURAGE VOTERS TO SAVE THE

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:02.024
RECALL FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.259
MALFEASANCE RATHER THAN BECAUSE

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:06.929
OF. OPPOSITION S. DIRECTLY

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.697
ATTENDED GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:09.965
GET VERY LITTLE ATTENTION FROM

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:12.568
THE GOVERNOR DEMOCRAT OR

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.603
REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES. I EVEN

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.372
BEING IN DIFFERENT PARTIES AND

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.539
THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS VERY

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.875
LITTLE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE OF

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.710
WHETHER THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.946
YES OF THE STATE ON THE SAME

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:26.048
PAGE AS THE GOVERNOR ON

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.250
CRITICAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. AND

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:30.586
FINALLY COST ABOUT HOW TO SAVE

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.855
ELECTION CROSS YEAH IT WAS

01:11:32.921 --> 01:11:34.890
UNBELIEVABLE THREE HUNDRED

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:35.624
MILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT ON

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.761
THIS- BUT THAT'S THE PROCESS WE

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.729
HAPPENED WHAT WHAT BE SURE WHAT

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.564
WHAT IT TAKES TO GET SOMETHING.

01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:45.868
ON THE BALLOT THE SYSTEM AS WE

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.036
KNOW IT TODAY TO TAKE PLACE.

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:50.039
BUT IF A RECALL IS APPROVED. AB

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.907
ONE TEN A COVER BECOME THE

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.709
INTERIM GOVERNOR. SUBSEQUENT

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.310
ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR WOULD BE

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:57.680
REQUIRED NOT PERMITTED AS IN

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:59.281

MY DATA PUBLIC HAS A PATIENTS

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.855
AGAIN TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:07.489
GENERAL ELECTION TO ELECT A NEW

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:10.259
GOVERNMENT. SO I'M JUST BRIEFLY

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:11.894
AND WRAP IT UP I DON'T BELIEVE

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.829
THE CURRENT RECALL. PROCESS IS

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.731
PERFECT BUT I THE VOICE OF THE

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.000
VOTING PUBLIC. SHOULD BE HEARD

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.702

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.636
BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT THE

ACTIVITIES OF THE INCUMBENT.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.639
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:26.709
THROUGH A RECALL PRESS PROCESS.

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.777

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:35.484
OPTION TO DATE RECALL PROCESS

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.051
THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AND

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.553
ACCEPTABLE. TO WHAT WE HAVE

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:40.022
TODAY. I DO BELIEVE THAT ANY

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:43.192
CHANGES SHOULD BE- HAVE

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:46.228
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. BY THE

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.530

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.632
THIS ISSUE DESERVES THAT. UNDER

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.901
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWER AND

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.169
CERTAINLY IF WE DO PUT

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.705
SOMETHING ON THE- BALLOT AND

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:57.206
THE BALLOT TO CHANGE ITS

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:59.541
CONSTITUTION. KEEP IT SIMPLE

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:00.876
AND FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:02.211
YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT IT'S GOING

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.346
TO BE GREAT DIFFICULT. BUT IT'S

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:06.615
GREAT FORWARD SO PEOPLE THINK

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.550
THEY'RE UNSURE AREN'T OUT THERE

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:10.285
YOU PROBABLY GET A VOTE NO.

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.054
THAT'S JUST THE HISTORY OF THE

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:15.124
BOAT. SO THAT'S A REAL QUICK

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:19.228
SUMMARY OF MARKET- OVERVIEW AND

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.315

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.622
THEN OBVIOUSLY NOW AS A CITIZEN

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:49.658
I WANT ANOTHER RECALL WHEN THE

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.059
WITH ATTEMPT TO RECALL GOVERNOR

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:53.128
NEWSOM. BUT I ALWAYS ASK WHY

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.197
THE RECALL SO WHEN I DID MY

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.899
RESEARCH ON THE REASONS WHY THE

01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:59.935
PROPONENTS. FILED A RECALL

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.169
PETITION AGAINST GOVERNOR

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.705
NEWSOM. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:05.607
TWENTY. I REMEMBER THAT WAS

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.008
QUITE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY THE

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.844
ECONOMY SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE THE

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.379
COBIT. BUT AS THE FAVORITE

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:12.047
TWENTY TWENTY THE REASONS

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:14.116
ASSERTED AND I'M GOING TO JUST.

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.584
YOU KNOW MENTION SOME OF THEM

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.220
WAS THEM. THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:20.155
IMPLEMENTED LAWS. WHICH ARE

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.791
DETRIMENTAL TO THE CITIZENS OF

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.960
THIS STATE AND OUR WAY OF LIFE.

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:28.697
THAT LAWS THAT HE ENDORSED. A

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:31.066
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. OVER THAT OF

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.802
OUR OWN CITIZENS- THAT HE

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.403
UNILATERALLY OVERRULE THE WILL

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.239
OF THE PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.341
THE DEATH PENALTY. AND HE ALSO

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:40.909
IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.811
OUR STATE. BY REMOVING

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.813
PROTECTIONS OF PROP THIRTEEN.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.717
RATIONING WATER USE- AS WELL AS

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.752
THEM THE CLEARING- IMPOSING A

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.854
CENTURY STATE STATUS. ON

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.523
CALIFORNIA. AND IT GOES FURTHER

01:19:54.589 --> 01:20:00.228
ON- SO. ATTENTION TO THE YOU

01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:01.630
KNOW BECAUSE WHEN I THAT. TO ME

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:03.532
IT SOUNDS LIKE A- TO. WITH A

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:06.301
DULY ELECTED OFFICER A DULY

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.936
ELECTED GOVERNOR. BUT

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.204
ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION IS

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.906
WHETHER THAT IS EIGHT RECALL

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.375
ADULTS OFFENSE. AND WHAT STATUS

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.178
DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW US POLICY

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.079
MAKERS AND EVEN US AS CITIZENS

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.781
WHAT STATUS DO WE HAVE TO GUIDE

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:21.683
US. AS TO WHAT IS A RECALL

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.152
OFFENSE. AND FROM THE INITIAL

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.421
RESEARCH THAT I HAVE DONE- I

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.155
REALLY HAVEN'T FOUND MUCH

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:29.124
INFORMATION. SO I STARTED

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.692
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:33.562
AND RIGHT AWAY I LOOKED AT THE-

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.330
THE STATUTORY SCHEME FOR THE

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.432
REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES. NOW

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.800
GRANTED FEDERAL JUDGES ARE

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.535
APPOINTED GRANTED THEIR

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.571
APPOINTED FOR LIFE AND GRANTED

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.172
WE HAVE TO ENSURE THEIR

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.908
IMPARTIALITY. BUT THE STANDARD

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.243
TO REMOVE A FEDERAL JUDGE IS

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:53.481
VERY HIGH IT BASICALLY AMOUNTS.

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.584
TO- EIGHT AM. GET A BASICALLY

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.386
THIS EIGHT DISAVOWAL WITH YOU

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.755
KNOW THE TREASON PART OF

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.123
BRIBERY AND OTHER HIGH CRIMES

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.792
AND MISDEMEANORS. BUT

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:04.993
UNFORTUNATELY I OUR OWN U. S.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.295
CONSTITUTION IS SILENT AS TO

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.264
HOW YOU WOULD DEFINE ESPECIALLY

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.199
HIGH CRIMES. HIGH CRIMES AND

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.434
MISDEMEANORS IT'S NOT VERY

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.102
CLEAR WHAT'S INTERESTING IS

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:15.804
THAT WHEN I WAS DOING RESEARCH

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.738
ON THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.807
JUDGES IT TURNS OUT THAT I

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.075
FOUND OUT THAT FORMER CHIEF

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:22.544
JUSTICE. WILLIAM REHNQUIST

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:24.346
ACTUALLY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:26.381
REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES. AND

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:27.816
HE CONCLUDED THAT THE EARLY

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:30.085
USES OF IMPEACHMENT TO REMOVE

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.320
FEDERAL JUDGES. HAVE

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.422
ESTABLISHED A NOR. THE NORM

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.958
BEING THAT JUDICIAL ACTS THAT

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:37.626
THE LEGAL RULINGS FROM THE

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:40.328
BENCH WILL NEVER BE A BASIS FOR

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:43.231
REMOVAL FROM OFFICE. SO

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.132
BASICALLY THAT MEANS THAT IF

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:46.301
LITIGANTS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.203
THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE. THOSE

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.771
WOULD NOT BE THE GROUNDS TO

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.107
REMOVE A UDGE THE ONLY OPTION

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.843
IS TO APPEAL THE DECISION. SO

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.778
IN THE RECALL SITUATION THAT WE

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.880
ARE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW. IF

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.181
THE RECALL PROPONENTS WERE

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.050
UNHAPPY WITH THE LAWS THAT

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:03.952
GOVERN A NUISANCE SIGN THEM THE

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.520
PROPER REMEDY WOULD BE TO GO TO

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.756
COURT. TO SEEK AN INJUNCTION

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.024
AND TO BASICALLY STOP THOSE

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.660
LAWS FROM TAKING EFFECT THAT'S

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:14.996
THE PROPER REAP A REMEDY. SO

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.298
BASICALLY WHAT I'M GOING TO

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.233
SUGGEST HONORABLE MEMBERS IS

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.934
KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT MY

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:20.669
DEAR FRIEND BRUCE MCPHERSON

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.637
MENTION WHICH IT HAS TO BE SOME

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.673
TYPE OF MALFEASANCE AND GRANTED

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:26.741
THERE'S FRANKLY NOT DEFINITION

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.610
OF TO HELP MALFEASANCE- IS

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.078
DESCRIBE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.913
CHECKLIST. SO WHAT I STARTED

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.582
DOING WAS IDENTIFY STATES. THAT

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:38.053
HAVE RECALL STATUTES BUT ONLY

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.854
FOR CLAUSE. AND I THINK THERE'S

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:41.923
ABOUT ELEVEN ELEVEN OF THEM IN

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:47.529
THE COUNTRY OF WHICH ONE OF.

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.129
THEM IS THE STATE OF GEORGIA.

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.832
NOW THE STATUS OF DRAW SAYS

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.667
GROUNDS FOR RE IN. THAT THE

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.601
OFFICIAL HAS COME AND- OF

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:56.338
MALFEASANCE WHILE IN OFFICE. TO

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:57.339
THE OFFICIAL VIOLATED THE OATH

01:22:57.405 --> 01:23:00.008
OF OFFICE. THREE THE OFFICIAL

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.976
HAS COMMITTED AN ACT OF

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.212
MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE. FOR THE

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.081
OFFICIALS GUILTY OF THE FAILURE

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.516
TO PERFORM DUTIES PRESCRIBED BY

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.753
LAW. AND FIVE THE OFFICIAL HAS

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.321
WILLFULLY WILLFULLY MISCUES

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:15.824
CONVERTED OR MISAPPROPRIATED

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.659
WITHOUT AUTHORITY PUBLIC

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.561
PROPERTY OR PUBLIC FUNDS

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:22.564
ENTRUSTED TO THAT OFFICIAL. NOW

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.265
THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS.

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.334
ABOUT THIS FOR COST REQUIREMENT

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:29.170
IN GEORGIA IS THAT IT ALSO HAS

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:30.905
AN INTERMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.540
PROCESS AND THAT IS THAT

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:34.309
THERE'S GOT TO BE A LEGAL

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.112
ADJUDICATION BY A JUDGE. AS TO

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.714
WHETHER COST DOES EXIST IN THIS

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:42.050
DIVISIONAL ADJUDICATION OF COST

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.017
FOR A RECALL WHICH I REALLY

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.953
THINK IT'S A WORTHY IDEA TO

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.688
ALSO INCLUDE YOUR IN YOUR

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:50.592
DISCUSSIONS. IT WOULD BASICALLY

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:51.393
ALLOW THE JUDGE. WHICH I TRULY

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:54.596
THAT IT SUMPAH. I'M GRANTED%

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.597
SOME PEOPLE MAY ARGUE THAT

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:56.931
POLITICAL BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.767
KNOW ALMOST VERYTHING IN LIFE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:01.002
IS POLITICAL BUT I HAVE BIG

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.605
BELIEF IN THE JUDICIARY. I'M IF

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.073
WE HAVE JUDICIAL EDUCATION

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.608
EDUCATION AS TO WHETHER BECAUSE

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.777
EXISTS. THEN IT BASICALLY

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.712
PROVIDES GUARDRAILS TO THE

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.381
WHOLE CONCEPT OF RECALL I DON'T

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:15.417
THINK ANYONE IS HEE TO SAY WE

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:16.951
DON'T LIKE RECALLS I DON'T

01:24:17.018 --> 01:24:18.653
THINK ANYONE IS HERE TO STAY.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.655
LET'S DESTROY THIS VERSION OF

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.724
DIRECT DEMOCRACY BUT I THINK

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:24.626
PEOPLE ARE HERE TO SAY THAT

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.060
LET'S PUT SOME SOME GUARD

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:29.664
RAILS. AROUNDTHIS. EXERCISE IN

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:31.966
DIRECT DEMOCRACY SO THAT RECALL

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:34.869
INSTEAD BE A REMEDY THAT IS

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:36.938
JUDICIOUSLY USED. NOT ****

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.706
NILLY BUT RATHER JUDICIOUSLY

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:41.843
USED PREFERABLY FOR BECAUSE THE

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.245
HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED. BY A

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.881
JUDGE FINALLY I'M SECRETARY

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.183
STATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:51.486
MENTION THE COSTS. OF A RECALL

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:52.887
AND THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.689
DOLLARS TO ME IS JUST AMAZING

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.291
BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.393
ENGAGING IN A RECOVERY IT'S

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:00.528
STILL VERY MUCH A LOPSIDED

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.863
RECORD ECONOMIC RECOVERY. OF

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.865
THE HAS A RECOVERING VERY

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.767
NICELY BUT THE HAVE NOTS ARE

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.402
STILL SUFFERING FROM JOB

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.571
INSECURITY EDUCATIONAL

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:11.506
LEGALIZATION BROADBAND

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:14.342
MARGINALIZATION SO THE IMAGINE

01:25:14.409 --> 01:25:15.310
WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE IT THE

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.145
STATE WITH THREE HUNDRED

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.580
MILLION AND I KNOW THAT YOU.

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.482
ESTATE LAWMAKERS HAD PLENTY OF

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.283
MONEY THIS LAST BUDGET SEASON

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.685
AND I KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.620
MONEY ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.355
BUDGET SEASON BUT GUESS WHAT

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:28.523
THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO LAST

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.091
FOREVER. AND I SPEAK FROM

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.526
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I WENT

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.561
THROUGH THE- THE VERY LEAN

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:35.563
BUDGET TIMES. IN A IN

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.932
SACRAMENTO AND THEY'RE NOT

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.267
THEY'RE NOT GOOD TIMES TRIPPED

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:43.938
OUT TRUST ME. THEIR NECK WITH.

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:46.774
SO THE ECONOMIC COST OR ARE HE-

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:47.408
THERE'S ALSO WHAT I CALL THE-

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:48.776
OF THE- LET'S BE HONEST WE'RE

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:50.912
ALL HUMAN. THE GOVERNOR WAS

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.180
DISTRACTED AND SO WAS THE

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.048
LEGISLATURE DISTRACTED DIST

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:56.050
DIST DISTRACTED BY THAT THE

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:59.120
RECALL- I WILL ALSO ADD TO THAT

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.155
THE COST OF CONFUSION. YOU KNOW

VOTERS YOU KNOW ARE SAYING WAIT

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:03.625
A MINUTE I THOUGHT WE JUST

ELECTED A GOVERNOR A YEAR AND A

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:07.529
HALF AGO. STILL THERE IS THE

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.864
COST OF CONFUSION AND WHEN

THAT'S MY STYLE. AND AT. AND

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:24.913
THE OTHER THE BEST COST I'M

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:28.516
TALKING ABOUT IS THE COST OF

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.551
AVOIDANCE. AND THAT IS THAT

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.085
EVERY IS BIG. YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:33.121
UNDER A CLOUD OF A RECALL AND

EVERYBODY'S UNDER THAT CLOUD

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.624
NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR BUT SO IS

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.793
THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT I MEAN BY

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.828
COST AVOIDANCE IS THAT THERE'S

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.463
GONNA BE SOME HUGE HUGE ISSUE

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.132
WITH WHICH ONLY BE ADDRESSED.

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:45.300
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:47.035
BASICALLY FUNNELLED THROUGH

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.503
WHAT AT ALL A PRISM OF RECALL

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:50.538
POLITICS. I'M BEING REALLY

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.307

SITE. I JUST BASICALLY ONE TO

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:11.526
SAY THAT. THAT IT TAKES A LOT

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.695
OF COURAGE TO DO. SAY FOR

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.630
EXAMPLE LEGISLATION ON BEHALF

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.665
OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IT

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:18.700
TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO DO

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:20.602
THAT. WITH THEIR UNDER RECALL

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.737

RULINGS. I STRONGLY BELIEVE

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:38.019
THAT THE SAME PROTECTION SHOULD

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:39.787
BE GIVEN TO A SITTING GOVERNOR.

01:27:39.854 --> 01:27:40.755
AND THAT PROTECTION SHOULD

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.690

IN OUR REPUBLIC OVERALL-

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:48.996
PROMOTING STABLE GOVERNMENTS.

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.831
WHILE PROTECTING MINORITY

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:53.334
VOICES. THROUGH SUCH TOOLS AS

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.536
SUPERMAJORITY VOTES JUDICIAL

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:57.505
DECISIONS AND DON'T NECESSARILY

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:58.773
REFLECT THE MAJORITY WILL IN

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:00.141
ANY GIVEN MOMENT OR IN SOME

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:02.510
STATES- RECALLING THE EXECUTIVE

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:03.878
OR LEGISLATOR SEEMS TO BE

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:05.613
PRAISED IN MY MIND. EACH OF

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.281
HESE IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:10.284
ACCOUNTABILITY- AND STABLE

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:12.620
GOVERNANCE. SO FOR PURPOSES OF

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:13.955
COMPARISON IN MY CASE SO

01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:15.623
SUPERMAJORITY VOTES THE CORE

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.091
PRINCIPLE FOR ME ANYWAY IS THAT

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:19.160
A FAIR MAJORITY VOTE. JUST

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:21.295
ISN'T ENOUGH SOMETIMES. YES

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:25.466
IT'S LEGITIMATE TO DEBATE. WHAT

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.802
CONSTITUTES. NUMBER BOTH. ANY

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:29.570
GIVE CERTAIN. IS IT TOO THIRDS

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:33.240
IS IT 5% DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN IN

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.810
ENACT IN SOME AREAS WHOPPERS

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.678
THE NOTION- BACK MORE THAN A

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.914
MAJORITY IS NECESSARY IN SOME

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.116
CASES. COMING TO ON THE ISSUE

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:43.884
OF THE RECALL THE MATTER IN

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.586
HAND MODIFYING THE

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:46.754
QUALIFICATIONS OF SUCH A

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.589
DRAMATIC ACTION IS REQUIRED

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.691
DISCUSSION. I'M NOT ADVOCATING

01:33:50.758 --> 01:33:52.860
READY IN THE RECALL NOR

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:54.829
NARROWING THERE'S SOMETHING

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.330
INSIDE OF OUR TALK ABOUT-

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:58.332
NERIMA FLORAL SO NARROW THAT NO

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:00.868
RECALL CAN QUALIFY- BUT

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.069
ENSURING PROPER USE WHEN

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:05.039
NECESSARY. AND NOT WITH NEARLY-

01:34:05.106 --> 01:34:07.375
POSSIBLE BACKED UP WHETHER A

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.210
PARTY OR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:15.149
MAY RECALL- DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:15.783
WISE TO DO SO. AND HERE'S WHY I

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.651
BELIEVE RECALL EFFORT SIR A

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:20.521
FRESH. VOTERS MORE IN MY MIND A

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.622
CRUSHING. READ ELECTION JUST

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:24.291
MONTHS GOING TO PRIMARY. WAS

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:25.826
UNNECESSARILY DISRUPTIVE I

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:27.161
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:29.163
THAT POINT BASED ON MERIT

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.031
POLICY DISAGREEMENTS AND

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:33.968
COSTLY. AS I WROTE RECENTLY. I

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.202
AM TWENTY A POLICY QUARRELS

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:36.337
WITH GOVERNOR KNEW SOMETHING I

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.872
DESPERATELY WISH SHE'D SUPPORT

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:40.641
MORE WATER STORAGE LOWER TAXES

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.343
REMOVE ON REASONABLE REGULATORY

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:44.512
BURDENS STOP UNDERMINING

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.914
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. CEASE

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:48.182
TRYING TO HINDER PUBLIC CHARTER

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:50.051
SCHOOLS JUST TO NAME A FEW.

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.285
HOWEVER GOVERNOR NEWSOM

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.453
CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR WITH

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.854
POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS QUITE

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.356
DIFFERENT FROM MY OWN ON THESE

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:58.159
MATTERS AND ONE ELECTION BY A

01:34:58.225 --> 01:35:00.227
LANDSLIDE. EARS AGO. AT THE

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:01.429
TIME OF THE RECALL HE WAS

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.064
SCHEDULED TO STAND FOR RE

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:03.998
ELECTION IN JUST A HANDFUL OF

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:06.600
MONTHS. IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:07.701
FOR SOMEONE NEW TO FORM A

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.603
GOVERNMENT. THOUSANDS OF

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:10.538
APPOINTMENTS THAT WOULD BE

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:11.739
NECESSARY DEVELOPMENT

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:13.541
LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY AND RUN IN

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.009
THE NEXT OPEN PRIMARY A FEW

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.078
MONTHS LATER. CONSIDER THAT

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.447
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER HAD THREE

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.615
YEARS TO DO SO. THERE ARE SO

01:35:21.682 --> 01:35:22.450
MANY IDEAS FOR YOUR

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:23.984
CONSIDERATION BY I LIKE TO

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.619
MENTION JUST A FEW HERE ARE AND

01:35:25.686 --> 01:35:27.822
QUALIFY A FEW HERE- AND SOME OF

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.690
OUR FILES TO BE SEMI PROCESSED

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:32.560
AFTER ALL FOR LEGISLATORS-

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:35.729
FIRST- I THINK ONE WAY TO

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:39.033
CALIBRATE THIS TENSION BETWEEN-

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.001
NOT WANTING TO MAKE. A BAR SO

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:43.104
DIFFICULT IS TO CONSIDER

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.472
RAISING THE SIGNATURES REQUIRED

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:46.440
FOR QUALIFICATION. COMMITTEE

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:48.776
HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH DATA

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.544
FROM THE STAFF REGARDING- THE

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:52.012
PERCENT OF SIGNATURES REQUIRED

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:53.314
FOR RECALL IN A MODEST HIGHER

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.916
THRESHOLD- WOULD DEMAND GOING

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:58.185
BEYOND MERE POLICY DIFFERENCES

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:59.820
IN MY MIND. YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.822
MAKE IT TOO HIGH. BUT I THINK

01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:03.791
TODAY IT'S TOO LOW. SECOND I

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.559
LIKE THE IDEA OF ELEVATING THE

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:06.994
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOLLOWING

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:09.063
THE SUCCESSFUL RECALL TO AVOID

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:11.532
THE CARTOONISH LIST OF DOZENS

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:16.470
OF REPLACEMENTS. BECAUSE THEY

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:17.138
GREATLY DIMINISHES. YES

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:18.372
REFLECTION ON WHO SHOULD WIENER

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:19.874
STATE. I THINK IT'S HARD TO

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.375
CALIBRATE BUT I DON'T AGREE

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:24.211
WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MULLIN-

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.479
I'M A VERY THOUGHTFUL

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:28.249
LEGISLATOR- ON SEPARATE OREGON

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.783
RUNNING AS A TICKET I LIKE THE

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.418
IDEA OF BEING SEPARATE EVEN IF

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:33.320
IT IS AN OPPOSITE PARTY FOR

01:36:33.387 --> 01:36:35.189
SOME OF THE REASONS EVEN-

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:37.525
SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON TO. ABOUT

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:40.628
AND- DENNIS WILL TAKE MUCH MORE

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.429
EXTENSIVE TO CALIBRATE RIGHT

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:43.797
AND I JUST HEARD A CENTER

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:45.866
STUDIO AND HER BRILLIANT LEGAL

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:47.635
MIND BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.503
SHOULD CONSIDER- AND WE EVEN

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:51.138
TALK ABOUT IT MUCH HERE LOOTING

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:53.107
THE TIME FRAME FROM WHICH A

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:55.209
RECALL PETITION CAN QUALIFY. A

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:56.777
RECALL SO LATE IN THE

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:58.345
GOVERNOR'S TERM DOES NOT

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:00.047
PROMOTE STABLE GOVERNMENT BUT

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:02.983
INSTEAD PROVED RATHER HAZARD IN

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.785
THIS CASE THAT THE LIMITING A

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:07.655
RECALL DOING HER MAYBE NOT JUST

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:09.290
QUALIFY TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.659
THE REGULAR OPEN PRIMARY- A

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:12.860
REGULAR ELECTION SHOULD BE

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.296
CONSIDERED. I'M OPEN TO MANY OF

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:16.463
THE OTHER IDEAS DISCUSSED AS

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.965
WELL BUT I JUST WANT TO

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:19.633
CONCLUDE BY SAYING I'M A

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.536
FRUSTRATED- INDEPENDENT DROPPED

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:28.776
FROM MY OWN CENTER. RIGHT

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:31.045
PERSPECTIVE- I TELL YOU WHAT WE

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.680
STILL GOT AND I WILL TO. FIND

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:33.981
THE RIGHT BALANCE I WON TO HAVE

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.583
THE TO READ. AND I'M TO HAVE A

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.084
TWO USED IN A CONCERT MAN- I

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.719
DON'T I'M ALONE IN THAT- AND I

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.988
THINK CAN DO ABOUT. SO WITHOUT

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:42.590
OKAY INCLUDING HOW THE ANSWER

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:43.724
ANY QUESTIONS ALONG WITH MY

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.059
COLLEAGUES IF THEY'D LIKE TO

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:48.729
I'VE BEEN. TERRIFIC THANK YOU

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:52.333
ASSEMBLY MEMBER. J. YEARS AFTER.

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:54.301
AGUIAR-CURRY HAS FOLLOWED QUEST.

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:56.670
IS THANKS SO MUCH IN A COMMUNAL

01:37:56.737 --> 01:37:57.938
IS A GREAT TO SEE YOU I'VE GOT

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:58.539
A QUESTION I'M COMPANY ON THE

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.507
SPOT SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT-

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.142
BUT THIS ONE THERE'S ANOTHER

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.011
KIND OF PART OF THE PROCESS

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:07.481
WHICH IS. THE- THE- KIND OF ITS

01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:08.816
SIGNATURES THAT NEED TO BE

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:11.252
COLLECTED OR OR OR THE- IT

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.354
PROCESS JUST TO PULL PAPERS.

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.022
JUST IT TO START THE RECALL

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.224
PROCESS AND I KNOW I'VE- SPOKEN

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.158
WITH SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:18.692
OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.828
FRUSTRATED TO SAY. YOU KNOW ALL

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:22.596
IT HAS TO HAPPEN I THINK IT'S-

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:24.498
FOR THE GOVERNOR IT'S- TWENTY

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.333
SIGNATURES SIXTY FIVE SIXTY. SO

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.869
DID TO START A RECALL PROCESS

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:31.939
FOR RECALLING THE GOVERNOR. YOU

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:32.539
JUST NEED TO SUBMIT SIXTY FIVE

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:34.341
SIGNATURES- AND AT THE LOCAL

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:35.442
LEVEL I CAN BE AS LITTLE AS TEN

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:37.978
SIGNATURES- TO START A RECALL

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.413
PROCESS. WHICH DOESN'T

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.715
NECESSARILY SHOW A REAL BRIGHT

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:44.151
THIRD DEPTH OF SUPPORT FOR THAT

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:45.753
RECALL. AND WOULD YOU THINK

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:47.621
THAT YOU KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.523
SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY AND PUT

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:51.225
ON THE BALLOT. IS THE

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:53.093
SIGNATURES TO JUST START THAT

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.762
PROCESS SIMPLE PAPERS. DO YOU

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:55.696
THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT MAYBE

01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:56.697
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.199
WELL- AS AS A AREA FOR

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:01.101
POSSIBLE. REFORM OF THE RECALL

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:05.806
PROCESS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:07.908
CAN BE LOOKED AT IN YOUR-

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:10.878
LEGISLATORS. YOU KNOW SO YOU

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.279
REALLY WANT TO HAVE. USED TO

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:16.550
BIGELOW BERMAN. I'M AND IS IT.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:19.820
TOO EASY NOW ON- YOU KNOW OUR

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:21.055
PASSIONS ARE NOT IN CHECK IN SO

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.956
WE CALL THOSE PAPERS AND HAVE

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:29.863
SO FEW SIGNATURES- NUMBER- OF

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.899
WHAT IT SHOULD REQUIRE BUT- UP-

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:32.633
I DO THINK IN THE INSTANCE IT

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:36.637
IS FEELS TO- AS WELL RIGHT NOW.

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:38.038
BUT I DO THINK THAT A SMALL

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:39.573
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SOMETIMES CAN

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:43.677
TAP INTO A LARGER MOMENT- SO I

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:46.146
WOULD NOT ACT- SUPPORT- MAKING

01:39:46.213 --> 01:39:50.617
THAT BURDEN SO CRUSHING. MAKES

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:54.955
SENSE IN A SENSE IT'S. A VERY

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:56.323
GOOD OTHER QUESTIONS FROM NOT

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:58.692
MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT A C. NINE AS

STATES BUT IF ENOUGH SIGNATURES

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:27.968
ARE GATHERED TO TRIGGER THE

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.670
RECALL THE RECALL PROCEDURE IS

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.572
A JUDICIAL TRIAL. NOT AN

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:33.440
ELECTION IN A TRIAL WAS HELD TO

01:43:33.507 --> 01:43:34.808
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ONE OF

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.677

THE STATE TO BE REMOTE. SO THAT

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.184

NCSL TRACKS OFF FOR RECALLS ARE

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.297
THE REASON. SO CAN IT BE FOR

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:58.599
ANY REASON OR TO SAY BECAUSE

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:01.001

THE MEASURE DOES QUALIFY FOR

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:28.061

JORDY POSITION. MAKES A RECALL

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.769
FOR ANY REASON THERE ARE TWELVE

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:37.537
STATES THAT PERMIT A RECALL FOR

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:39.906
ANY REASON E. EIGHTY STATES

THAT. ONLY REQUIRED FOR CALLS

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:43.944
ONE OF THOSE IS VIRGINIA JUST

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.278
ALL STATE NOTAN ACTUAL

01:44:45.345 --> 01:44:47.381
ELECTION SO THERE ARE ONLY

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.949
SEVEN STATES THAT REQUIRE A

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:53.353
CLAUSE FOR A RECALL ELECTION-

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.890

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.025
NUMBERS WHICH IS NEEDED TO

TRIGGER RECALL CALIFORNIA IS

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.194
ONE OF THE MOST PERMITS STATES

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:03.063
IN THE COUNTRY THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:05.532
STATE MONTANA NEVER IS A LOWER

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.300
PERCENTAGE OF SIGNATURES TO

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.002
QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT ALL OF

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:11.471
THE OTHER STATES HAVE A FIRE

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.140
ALTERCATION HOWEVER I WILL NOTE

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:15.175
THAT MONTANA IN CALIFORNIA DO

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:17.110
DIFFER ON ONE KEY POINT WHICH

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:19.846
IS THAT MONTANA. ALL THE

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:21.481
PERCENTAGE WHICH IS 10%

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:24.284
CALIFORNIA'S 12% MONTANA'S 10%

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:25.519
OF REGISTERED VOTERS WORST

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.988
CALIFORNIA'S 12% OF THE NUMBER

01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:29.022
OF VOTES CAST FOR THAT

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:30.257
PARTICULAR OFFICE IN THE MOST

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:31.825
RECENT ELECTION SO YOU COULD

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:33.126
SEE A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH

01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:35.562
CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:39.099
SIGNATURE PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD.

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:40.967
IN THE COUNTRY. AND HERE'S

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:43.003
ANOTHER SLIDE TO LAY OUT WHAT

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:45.672
THOSE STATES ARE- CALIFORNIA SO

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.140
YOU CAN SEE EXAMPLES ADEQUATE

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:48.975
FOR THE SLACK IS THE LOWEST.

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:50.410
AND THEN THE MAJORITY OF STATES

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:53.814
HAVE A 25% OR GREATER SPECIALTY

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:54.648
MOST OF THE STATES IN THAT

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:56.850
CATEGORY ARE AT 25% BUT THERE

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.585
ARE A FEW THAT HAVE. SPECIAL TO

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.420
ELEVATE IT BEYOND THAT I WILL

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:01.788
NOTE THAT A LOT OF THINGS TO

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:02.723
HAVE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS FOR

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.658
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICES ROB

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:07.928
THIS PRESENTATION I'M REFERRING

ONLY TO STATEWIDE OFFICES.

01:46:11.965 --> 01:46:13.433
THERE'S A RAGING FACTOR IS THE

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.202
LENGTH OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER.

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.336
AGAIN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE

01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:17.537
MOST PERMISSIVE STATES IN THE

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:19.806
COUNTRY ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT AS

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:20.373

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:48.668
THE LENGTH OF THE PERIOD AND

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:50.237
LOSS THAT'S DECIDED TO- AT THE

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:54.407
MOMENT OF THE RECALL HELLO THAT.

01:46:54.474 --> 01:46:56.810
WILL BE. AND SO YOU CAN SEE IT

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.845
AGAIN BROKE INTO THE START OF

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.046
THE MAJORITY OF STATES EITHER

01:47:00.113 --> 01:47:01.982
STAY UP TO NINETY DAYS FOR

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:05.018
THREE MONTHS OCT TENTH OCTOBER

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:05.585
TENTH. NOT TO THE NUMBER OF

01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:07.754
DAYS. FOR EASE OF ALL ITS

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:08.989
INFORMATION ONCE LINE A

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.457
COMBINED THIS KIND OF WORKS.

01:47:10.524 --> 01:47:12.559
ANOTHER ONLY TWO STATES THAT

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.594
HAVE EIGHT INTERMEDIATE LENGTH

01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:21.635
OF TIME ARIZONA AND WHATNOT. SO

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.670
THE LAST CATEGORY IS OUR THE

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:26.373
RECALL CANDIDATE IS REPLACED

01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:27.974
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE IS MORE

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:28.975
EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN THE STATE'S

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:30.544
CALVET IT IS IN THE FIRST

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:32.679
CATEGORY WHERE THE RECALL AND

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.181
REPLACEMENT ELECTIONS ARE HELD

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:36.950
SIMULTANEOUSLY. SECOND CATEGORY

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:37.717
WHERE THERE'S A SPECIAL

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:40.153
ELECTION AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.755
RECALL TO APPOINT THE SUCCESSOR

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:42.989
SO WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:45.158
ELECTIONS THAT OCCUR AND THEN

01:47:45.225 --> 01:47:46.326
AND THERE IN FIVE STATES THE

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:50.964
SUCCESSOR. SUCCESSOR IS NOT. ON

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:53.900
ELECTED BY PEOPLE OF THE STATE-

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:54.935
A COUPLE OF INTERESTING CARRY

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:56.903
OUT YOUR CALIFORNIA COLORADO

01:47:56.970 --> 01:47:59.539
THE ONLY STATE THAT I HAVE THE

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:01.908
ELECTION- SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.743
TWO SEPARATE. QUESTIONS ANY

01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:05.946
OTHER STATES. THE WAIT I'D BE

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:06.780
EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO THINK

01:48:06.847 --> 01:48:09.482
ABOUT. THE SUCCESS OF THE

01:48:09.549 --> 01:48:11.251
MISSION OF THE RECALL PETITION

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:12.619
ACTS AS THE RECALL ITSELF

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:13.653
THAT'S SIMPLE TO CALIFORNIA'S

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.021
FIRST QUESTION RIGHT THE

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:17.324
OFFICER IS FUNCTIONALLY RECALL

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:19.392
THAT. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:21.461
RECALL OFFICERS PERMITTED TO

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:23.263
RUN REPLACEMENT BALLOTS SO THEY

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.664
CAN ESSENTIALLY BE REELECTED

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:25.932
BACK INTO THE OFFICE THAT THEY

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:28.368
HELL DON'T REMOVED DURING THAT.

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:30.971
PERIOD SO IT'S NOT EXACT SAME

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.305
THE SAME THE RECALL BUT FOR

01:48:32.372 --> 01:48:34.007
PURPOSES OF CONCEPTUALIZING

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:36.810
ACTION PROCESS. THAT'S THE BEST

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:37.444
ANALOGY I CAN GIVE TO

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:39.880
CALIFORNIA. I IN FOR THOSE FIVE

01:48:39.946 --> 01:48:41.214
STATES THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:41.982
CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:44.584
CALIFORNIA COLORADO. THE

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:45.552
CURRENT OFFICE HOLDERS

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:46.753
AUTOMATICALLY PLACED ON THE

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.355
BALLOT UNLESS THEY RESIGN FROM

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:51.091
OFFICE SO THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:52.392
MECHANISM FOR PUTTING THE MECCA

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:54.628
ONLY NEVADA. REQUIRES THE

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:55.795
CURRENT OFFICE HOLDER TO

01:48:55.862 --> 01:49:01.768
ACTUALLY SIGN BACK ON. TO GET

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:02.335
ON TO THE PLACE OUT. JUST A

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:03.837
FINAL TO. THAT I THINK ARE

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:05.372
INTERESTING OF THE THREE

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:08.241
STATES. THAT THREE OF THE FIVE

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.810
STATES THAT HAVE THE- APPOINTED

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.612
REPLACEMENT IDAHO KANSAS AND

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:13.980
WASHINGTON REQUIRED AT THEIR

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:14.814
PLACE TO BE FROM THE SAME

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.116
POLITICAL ARE USED TO BE CALLED

01:49:16.182 --> 01:49:17.317
CANADA. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.085
MECHANISMS FOR SELECTING THAT

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:20.754
PERSON SOMETIMES IT'S- THE

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.855
STATE SECOND COMMITTEE OF THE

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.223
PARTY SUBMITS NAMES AND THAT'S

01:49:23.290 --> 01:49:25.492
CHOSEN SOMETIMES IT. OUT

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:27.594
SOMEONE ELSE IN THE PARKING. A

01:49:27.661 --> 01:49:29.029
SOME OTHER STATE ELECTED

01:49:29.095 --> 01:49:29.996
OFFICER WHO WAS OF THE SAME

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:31.531
PARTY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE ON

01:49:31.598 --> 01:49:33.166
THE SAME POLITICAL PARTY. AND

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:35.335
IN CALIFORNIA GEORGIA LOUISIANA

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:38.204
MONTANA AND WASHINGTON ARE UP

IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:10.804
COMMENTS PRESSURES THE ART OF

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:14.908
QUESTION. SIR MY QUESTION BET

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:16.209
MISTER WILLIAMS MY OTHER

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.777
QUESTION IS ON YOUR SLIDE ABOUT

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:19.579
THE LENGTH OF SIGNATURE

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:22.015
GATHERING PERIOD BY STATE. DID

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:24.851
YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:26.353
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS A-

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:28.989
VERY. A AN EFFORT THAT HAS TO

01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:30.991
BE PUT TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:31.057 --> 01:50:32.625
COLLECT SIGNATURES IN

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.194
CALIFORNIA HAS A HUGE

01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:37.163
POPULATION. AND SO RIGHT NOW AT

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:38.999
LEAST I THINK THE LAST ELECTION

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:40.166
THERE THIS THIS PREVIOUS

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:42.002
ELECTION IT WAS ONE POINT FIVE

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:43.636
MILLION SIGNATURES THEY HAD

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:46.973
COLLECTED WHEREAS SAY MONTANA.

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:49.776
PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:51.011
THAT MANY AND IT WOULD TAKE

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:52.879
THEM A LOT LESS TIME AND THAT

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:54.481
MAY BE WHY THERE IS A

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:55.081
DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK THAT

01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:58.251
DIFFERENCE. IS CORRELATED TO

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.953
THE POPULATION THE DIFFICULTY

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:02.489
IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE TO

01:51:02.555 --> 01:51:04.324
ORGANIZE AN EFFORT TO TRY TO

01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:06.359
GET THOSE OBTAINED OBTAIN

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:09.496
SIGNATURES TO HAVE A- GET IT.

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:13.299
THAT RECALL ON THE BALLOT. NOT

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:15.902
SURE CERTAIN I EXCITED THAT I

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.470
SHOULD DID NOT CONTROL FOR

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:20.140
POPULATION DIFFERENCES SO IT'S

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:22.409
HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT THERE CAN

01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:24.210
BE REASONS TO COMMITTED BY

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:25.578
LEGISLATORS FOR THE LENGTH OF

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:26.679
THEIR TIMELINES I'M NOT

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:28.615
FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:29.916
HISTORY BEHIND WHY CALIFORNIA

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:32.886
SELECT X. WHEN DID IT YEAH- SO

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.921
I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:36.523
WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU SAID IS

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:37.891
TRUE IT DEFINITELY SEEMS

01:51:37.957 --> 01:51:39.559
REASONABLE TO ME. I UNDERSTAND

01:51:39.626 --> 01:51:40.860
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.362
QUESTIONS I HAVE IS MAYBE THOSE

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:43.830
LONGER TIME PERIODS ARE BECAUSE

01:51:43.897 --> 01:51:45.665
OF THE POPULATION DIFFERENCE

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:48.301
WHEN YOU LOOK AT COLORADO IDAHO

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.236
KANSAS MONTANA COMPARED TO

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:52.038
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION I THINK

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.506
WE MIGHT HAVE MORE THAN ALSO

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:58.511
PUT TOGETHER SO- SO ANYWAY. AT

01:51:58.578 --> 01:52:02.182
THAT CLARIFICATION. FOR THE

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:04.250
YOU'RE GLAZER YEAH- MISTER

YEARS TO SANCTION AND CLEAR

01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:09.289
TESTIMONY SOMETIMES I WORRY WE

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:11.024
AVOID THE OBVIOUS IN THESE

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:13.026
KINDS THE DEBATE SO I WANT TO

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.627
ASK A QUESTION THAT- MAY BE

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:16.296
OBVIOUS TO SOME OF US BUT IT

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:16.863
WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE YOUR

01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.798
CLARIFICATION IT WILL JUST WANT

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:20.400
TO RECALL THE ATMOSPHERICS OF

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.267
IT ALL WAS THAT IT WAS A

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:23.403
PARTISAN ISSUE ONE PARTY WAS

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:25.038
NOT HAPPY ANOTHER PARTY WAS IN

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:27.640
POWER- AND YOU BROKE DOWN THE

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.741
STATE'S THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:31.544
ANY RECALL. AND THOSE THAT DO

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:33.113
IS THERE ANY KIND OF PARTISAN-

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:34.781
BREAK IN AND THAT DATA THAT

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:36.049
WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT ONE

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:37.851
PARTY OR THE OTHER I FELT THAT

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:39.152
IT WAS A MORE IMPORTANT ARE

01:52:39.219 --> 01:52:41.721
DOMINATING OPTION. THAN THE

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:47.193
OTHER. CHECK JUST TAKE A QUICK

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.062
LOOK AT THAT SLIDE AGAIN THAT'S

01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:50.463
A AYE WILL THAT WAS. NOT

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.065
SOMETHING THAT I'M AT. THROUGH

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:55.401
THAT LENS COMING INTO THIS- THE

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:56.436
ONE THING THAT ARE STAND OUT TO

01:52:56.503 --> 01:52:59.205
ME VERY CLEARLY IS THAT THE- US

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:02.142
STATES THAT PERMITS THE RECALL.

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.610
SO TO BE THE STATE'S THAT ALSO

01:53:03.676 --> 01:53:04.978
PERMITS CITIZENS INITIATIVES

01:53:05.044 --> 01:53:06.279
OUT MEASURES THAT HAVE MORE

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:07.780
DIRECT DEMOCRACY MECHANISMS

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:09.449
THAT OTHERS THAT HAS A WESTERN

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:11.618
BIAS. TO BE MORE STATES IN THE

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:12.719
WESTERN UNITED STATES THAT

01:53:12.785 --> 01:53:15.021
PROCEDURE SO I'M SEEING THAT

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:16.389
TRAIN ON THE MAP THAT DOESN'T

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:18.625
SURPRISE ME AT ALL. I'M LOOKING

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:20.960
AT MY SCREEN JUST. ANALYZE IT

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:25.765
D. R. SEVERAL STATES THAT HAVE.

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:26.933
NOT DEMOCRATIC CONTROL BUT

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.837
THERE. ARE SEVERAL THAT HAVE

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.038
REPUBLICAN CONTROLS WELL. TEN

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:35.508

OF HEAT RECALL ELECTIONS

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:42.081
THEMSELVES SO THERE'S A PRICE

01:53:42.148 --> 01:53:44.050
THAT ELECTIONS ARE PARTISAN AND

ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES

01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:58.198
THAT ARE SET IN PLACE AT THAT

01:53:58.264 --> 01:54:00.767
TIME AND SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:02.035
REASONS WHY I LOVE COMING TO

OF ELECTION ADMINISTRATION

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.076
ELECTION MANAGEMENT. BUT THANK

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:11.344
YOU AND BUT LOOKING AT IT FROM

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:12.612
A PARTISAN POINT OF VIEW WHEN

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:13.846
YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO DON'T

01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:16.216
PERMIT A RECALL. AND YOU SEE ON

01:54:16.282 --> 01:54:18.585
THE SAME PAGE TEXAS. WITH NEW

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:20.720

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:23.256
FLORIDA. AND OHIO THAT'S WHAT

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:25.191
THEY DOESN'T COME ACROSS AS A

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:27.427
PARTISAN SPLIT DOES IT TO YOU.

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.429
NO NO NOT PARTICULARLY I MEAN.

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:33.399
IT'S AT LEAST NOT I THINK IT'S

01:54:33.466 --> 01:54:34.367
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT A

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:36.569
LOT OF THESE LOSSES DR DECADES

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:42.442
DECADES AGO SO THE. NOW BUT AS

01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:44.110
I LOOK AT THIS NOW IT DOESN'T

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:45.945
STRIKE ME THAT ALL THE STATES

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:48.248
ARE OF ONE PARTY IN ALL THE

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.649
STATES THAT DON'T PERMIT

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.117
RECALLS ARE OF THE OTHER PARTY

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:52.285
GREAT AND FINALLY SEEMS LIKE A

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.787
RELATIVELY MIXED UP BACK IN

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:57.323

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:01.828
LOOKING AT NORTH DAKOTA AND

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.264
MONTANA ALONG WITH ARIZONA IN

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.932
CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN DOESN'T

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.834
SEEM TO BE A PARTISAN SPLIT IN

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.469
TERMS OF DOMINANCE BY ONE PARTY

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:12.438

01:55:58.384 --> 01:56:00.119
THAT THAT. HAS A LOWER

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:03.856
PERCENTAGE OF SIGNATURES NOT

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:04.490

SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT IT

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:16.909
DIRECTLY TRANSLATES TO

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:18.978
INCREASED COST. IT WAS LIKE A

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:20.279
PRESS PER SENATE-ROOM WAS

02:00:20.346 --> 02:00:21.714
BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN DOLLARS

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:23.249
FOR THE SEVEN DOLLAR AVERAGE

02:00:23.316 --> 02:00:24.483
FOR EXAMPLE TO CALIFORNIA

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:26.052
MISSION IS THAT LIKE THE RECALL

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:27.787
ALSO RECEIVED EXTENSIONS. BUT

02:00:27.853 --> 02:00:29.589
IT'S REPORTED COSTA BETWEEN

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.122
FIVE AND SEVEN DOLLARS PER

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:31.891
SIGNATURE. THAT'S VERY

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:34.060
EXPENSIVE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:00:34.126 --> 02:00:35.394
QUICKLY PROPONENTS NEEDED ABOUT

02:00:35.461 --> 02:00:36.062

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:38.264
SUBMITTED ABOUT TWO POINT ONE

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:40.399
MILLION AT SEVEN DOLLARS PER

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:40.900
SIGNATURE THAT'S FIFTEEN

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:42.635
MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S NO

02:00:42.702 --> 02:00:44.971
QUESTION A QUALIFYING COST

02:00:45.037 --> 02:00:46.038
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ABOVE

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:47.506
WOULD BEAR SMALL CITIZEN ACTION

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:51.277
GROUPS REALLY. ANYONE WITHOUT

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:52.144
WHAT WEALTHY BACKERS. BOTTLING

02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:53.546
A REASON SURGERY. IS LOOKING TO

02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:55.047
SOMETHING SIX. AND MAKE IT

02:00:55.114 --> 02:00:57.650
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. THE

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:58.818
COST REALITY AFFECTS HOW WE

02:00:58.884 --> 02:01:00.519
SHOULD VIEW CALIFORNIA RELATION

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.021
TO OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:03.356
SEEMS LIKE IT HAS THE LITTLE

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:04.857
SIGNATURE PERCENTAGE OF 12%

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:06.058
THAT IS MY CALLING JUST

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.860
EXPLAINED MONTANA HAS ACTUALLY

02:01:07.927 --> 02:01:09.795
WAS PERCENTAGE. AND BECAUSE IT

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:10.997
IS THE LARGEST OF OUR

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:12.531
POPULATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE

02:01:12.598 --> 02:01:14.000
HIGHEST WIENER SIGNATURES

02:01:14.066 --> 02:01:15.368

ELIGILE VOTERS REGISTERED

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:20.239
VOTERS WERE TURNED OUT. WE WERE

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:21.407
ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE POPULATION

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:25.578
OF EITHER OF THE NEXT LARGEST

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:26.178
RECALL STATES BUTCHER ILLINOIS

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:27.246
IN GEORGIA. VIEW AS A PERCENT

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:29.081
OF POP. CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE

02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:30.316
IT HAS THE LOWEST SIGNATURE

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.651

QUALIFYING RULE. HI WITH

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:35.187
MONTANA FISH BY ELIGIBLE VOTERS

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:35.821
WOULD USE A PERCENT OF

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:36.922
POPULATION IS POTENTIALLY

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:38.124
MISLEADING BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.759
HAS THE LARGEST INELIGIBLE

02:01:39.825 --> 02:01:41.560

POPULATION. JUST SIXTY FIVE

02:01:45.264 --> 02:01:46.799
POINT 7% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.934
ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. IN CALIFORNIA

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.536
ONLY HAS BY FR THE LARGEST

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.538
AFTER DEVIATION FROM THE MEDIAN

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:53.205
REAL SIGNATURE NUMBER

02:01:53.272 --> 02:01:56.475
REGARDLESS OF THE WILL OF THE

02:01:56.542 --> 02:01:58.611

02:01:58.678 --> 02:01:59.679
BEDIENT IF IT'S BY. VOTERS IN

02:01:59.745 --> 02:02:03.516
THE NEW TRIPLES BY. OR BY TWO.

02:02:03.582 --> 02:02:04.150
MOVING CALIFORNIA CHAU CLOSE TO

02:02:04.216 --> 02:02:06.252
THE AS A PERCENT OF POPULATION

02:02:06.318 --> 02:02:07.253
WOULD REQUIRE DOUBLING THE

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:09.121
CURRENT SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:11.390
225% REGARDLESS OF THE RULE.

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:12.658
DOING SO WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:16.228
DEVIATE KINGDOM FEATHER UPWARD

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:16.829
FROM THE MEDIAN REAL NUMBER.

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:17.830
FOR EXAMPLE INCOME THE PERCENT

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.699
OF TURNOUT. WHICH IS THE LOWEST

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:21.600
DENOMINATOR TRANSLATES TO HUGE

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:24.170
COST INCREASES. 20% OF TURNOUT

02:02:24.236 --> 02:02:25.371
IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE

02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:26.739
MILLION SIGNATURES AT SEVEN

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:28.407
DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE THAT'S

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:29.909
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:02:29.975 --> 02:02:31.143
25% OF TURNOUT IS ABOUT FOUR

02:02:31.210 --> 02:02:32.445
POINT THREE MILLION SIGNATURES

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:34.413
AT SEVEN DOLLARS PER THIRTY ONE

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.082
MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A FEW

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.750
YEARS TURNOUT WHICH AGAIN IS

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.552
THE LOWEST OF THE DENOMINATORS.

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:41.020
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FIRST FOR

02:02:41.087 --> 02:02:42.088
DIFFERENT REGISTRATIONS THE

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:43.189
MARKET BECAUSE IT'S LESS

02:02:43.255 --> 02:02:44.623
VARIABLE THAN TURNOUT SO

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:45.925
SPECIAL TO REGISTER DOES HAVE

02:02:45.991 --> 02:02:47.460
SOME ADVANTAGES BUT A PRODUCES

02:02:47.526 --> 02:02:49.395
ONLY MINOR FACTS. TURNOUT IS

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:50.896
GENERALLY A LOWER NUMBER

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:52.398
SUBSCRIPTION TO REGISTER ROOM

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.866
INCREASE THE SIGNATURE NUMBER

02:02:53.933 --> 02:02:55.634
BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY. 20% OF

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:57.436
REGISTERED VOTERS IS ABOUT

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:57.970
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MORE

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:59.572
SENATORS AND SEVEN BASS PRO

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:00.539
THAT START ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

02:03:00.606 --> 02:03:02.575
MILLION DOLLARS. 25% OF

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:04.510
REGISTERED IS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR

02:03:04.577 --> 02:03:05.745
THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTY FOUR

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:06.512
THOUSAND MORE SIGNATURES AGAIN

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:07.847
IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS PER BUT

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:09.048
STILL ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:10.816
DOLLARS. SO SWITCHING TO

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:12.518
REGISTER FROM TURNOUT IS THE

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:13.919
MARKER HAS ONLY MINOR EFFECTS

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:15.087
OF SLAVERY INCREASING

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.288
DIFFICULTY IN REDUCING

02:03:16.355 --> 02:03:21.460
VARIATION SOMEWHAT. SO IT'S NOT

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:22.228
MUCH OF A REFORM. THAT'S THE

02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:23.696
SIGNATURE. THE ANALYSIS GAS

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:25.765
TIME IS. COMPRESSOR INCREASED

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:27.466
DIFFICULTY AND RAISE COSTS

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:29.168
EXPANDING TO. MAKE IT EASIER

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.970
AND CAN LOWER COSTS. WHAT'S

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.271
IMPORTANT HERE TO CONSIDER THE

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.839
EFFECT OF CHANGING BERMAN

02:03:33.906 --> 02:03:35.875
NUMBER AND THE TIME. IF YOU

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.676
COMBINE INCREASING RESEARCHERS

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.278
PRESSED COMPRESSING THE PERIOD

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:41.113
PLUS INCREASING THE COST THAT

02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:43.015
IT WAS REQUESTED DIFFICULT TO

02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:44.984
QUALIFY THAT NONE EVER WILL. IT

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:46.819
SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO PERMIT THE

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.220
INITIATIVE THE REQUEST AND WILL

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:50.389
BE USED MUCH LESS. MAKING IT

02:03:50.456 --> 02:03:51.757
HARDER TO USE HE RECALL COULD

02:03:51.824 --> 02:03:53.325
TAKE IT FROM A RARE BIRD TO AN

6% THE BOTTOM INE TEARS

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:15.915

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:11.430
TO SPEAK UP AGAIN WE CAN MAKE

02:06:11.497 --> 02:06:13.232
SURE WE CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:16.535

WELL THAK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:21.206
YOU- LET ME JUST KIND OF

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:22.241
QUICKLY JUMP THROUGH A COUPLE

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:23.509
OF THINGS HERE. BECAUSE I KNOW

02:06:23.575 --> 02:06:25.844
TIME IS SHORT HERE- I WILL TO

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:26.812
THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:28.847
QUESTION MYSELF. AND THE

02:06:28.914 --> 02:06:30.449
QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS IF YOU

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:31.517
WANT TO PLAY AT THE THRESHOLD

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:32.918
DO YOU WANT TO CONSIDER MAYBE

02:06:32.985 --> 02:06:34.453
RAISING IT TO THE SAME 20%

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.155
THRESHOLD THAT APPLIES TO.

02:06:36.221 --> 02:06:38.057
STATE SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:38.757
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF

02:06:38.824 --> 02:06:40.626
EQUALIZATION AND APPEALS COURT.

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:42.928
JUDGES I KNOW THIS IS APPLES

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.063
AND ORANGES BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:45.597
TAKING A STATEWIDE OFFICE AND

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:47.066
TREATED THE SAME AS A LOCAL

02:06:47.132 --> 02:06:49.001
REGIONAL OFFICE BUT- IF THE

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:50.936
IDEA IS TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:52.805
MORE FOLKS POPULI THEN PERHAPS.

02:06:52.871 --> 02:06:54.073
YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THE HIGHER

02:06:54.139 --> 02:06:55.274
THRESHOLD I DID THE MATH BY THE

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:57.042
WAY IF YOU RAISE 220% YOU'RE

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:59.011
LOOKING AT TWO POINT FOUR NINE

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:00.946
THREE. MILLION SIGNATURES WHICH

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:02.514
MEANS THAT THE LAST RECALL WITH

02:07:02.581 --> 02:07:03.916
A FOLLOW SHOT ABOUT SEVEN

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:05.284
DEGREES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:07.252
VOTES. OTHER OPTION IS TO. KEEP

02:07:07.319 --> 02:07:08.988
THE 12% THRESHOLD APPLIED TO

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:10.255
REGISTERED VOTERS FROM WHICH IN

02:07:10.322 --> 02:07:11.557
ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION THE

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:13.125
LAST TIME I CHECKED. THAT WOULD

02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:14.393
REQUIRE TWO POINT SIX MILLION

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.695
SIGNATURES SO- AS DAVID

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:17.896
MENTIONED YOU WERE PRETTY MUCH

02:07:17.963 --> 02:07:19.531
PUTTING THE RECALL PROCESS OUT

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:20.366
OF THE BUSINESS IF YOU DO

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:22.801
THOSE- I THINK A MUCH MORE

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.103
PRACTICAL APPROACH HERE MIGHT

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:26.038
BE ONE OF SIGNATURE GATHERING-

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:27.106
AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY I

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:28.240
APOLOGIZE IF I'M REPEATING

02:07:28.307 --> 02:07:30.042
ANYTHING I JUMPED ON THIS ABOUT

02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:31.343
TWENTY MINUTES AGO AND I. I

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.811
MEASURE BROKEN GOING GOOD IN

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:33.979
THE SAME THEMES MAYBE THAT'S

02:07:34.046 --> 02:07:35.614
GOOD. THANKS TO A SUGGEST

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:37.416
CONSENSUS HERE. BOB CALIFORNIA

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.784
WITH A HUNDRED SIXTY DAYS I

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.352
WENT TO THE OTHER EIGHTEEN

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:42.154
RECALL STATE SO. OBVIOUSLY

02:07:42.221 --> 02:07:44.623
NOBODY IS CALIFORNIA- BUT I DID

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:46.125
FIND SPREE THAT HAVE ABOUT A

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:51.630
THIRD OF OUR POPULATION THAT'S.

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:52.264
GEORGIA ILLINOIS MICHIGAN. YOUR

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:53.899
REQUIRES NINETY DAY CIRCUIT-

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:56.602
MICHIGAN NINETY DAYS ILLINOIS.

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:58.170
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. I

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.638
WOULD NOT BE AVERSE TO THE IDEA

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.373
OF TAKING THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.608
DAY WINDOW UNTIL. YOU GET DOWN

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:04.510
TO LET STATE. ARGUMENT ONE

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.412
TWENTY. WHY WOULD THAT BE

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:07.846
BECAUSE I THINK CALIFORNIA

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:09.481
DESPITE THE SIZE A LARGER

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:10.582
POPULATION THE GREATER

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.684
GEOGRAPHY. HAS THREE ADVANTAGES

02:08:12.751 --> 02:08:14.253
IS OTHER STATES DON'T NUMBER

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:15.988
ONE WE HAVE WELL THE LAST

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:17.956
WEEKEND- NOT INCLUDED. WE HAVE

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.024
BETTER WEATHER THAN MOST OTHER

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.092
STATES WE'RE NOT GONNA GET

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:21.593
KNOCKED DOWN. FOR A WEEK BY

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.263
SNOW STORM OR- OR HURRICANE- SO

02:08:24.329 --> 02:08:27.433
IT'S EASIER PHYSICALLY TO GET

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:28.000
OUT AND COLLECT SIGNATURES.

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:29.501
SECONDLY WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER

02:08:29.568 --> 02:08:30.936
TECHNOLOGY WHICH BEGS THE

02:08:31.003 --> 02:08:31.970
QUESTION IF WE WANT TO EXPLORE

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:34.306
THE IDEA. OF DOING A SIGNATURE

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:36.275
GATHERING ONLINE FOR RECALLS.

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.676
AND THEN THIRDLY WE ALREADY

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:38.977
HAVE A BUILT IN PROCESS OF

02:08:39.044 --> 02:08:40.979
INITIATIVES WE HAVE A VIBRANT

02:08:41.046 --> 02:08:42.681
SIGNATURE GATHERING AT A STREET

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:46.118
IN. THE STATE- AS FOR UP NOW I

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:47.386
WANT TO TAKE YOU QUICKLY TO

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.587
AREAS I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:50.355
HERE ONE. IS I THINK WE NEED TO

02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:52.758
CONSIDER THE GROUNDS FOR RECALL

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:55.160
AND HERE I WOULD JOB. CONSIDER

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:56.862
THIS BOB WE WANT TO MAKE A

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.564
RECALL VOTE SIMPLY A VOTE OF NO

02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.265
CONFIDENCE. WE WANT TO MAKE A

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.600
RECALL VOTE A CHANCE TO

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.168
RELITIGATE THE PAST LEFT AND WE

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:04.603
WANT TO MAKE RECALL SOMETHING

02:09:04.670 --> 02:09:06.672
THAT A- LITTLE BIT TO. THE

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:08.140
PUBLIC'S IMPEACHING OF AN

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:10.142
OFFICER IF SO THEN THE QUESTION

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:11.910
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PIECE

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:12.911
GOT WHICH IS HIGH CRIMES AND

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:14.713
MISDEMEANORS FOR PRESIDENT. I

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:15.981
HOPE WE DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD

02:09:16.048 --> 02:09:16.882
WITH THAT TERM THAT'S A

02:09:16.949 --> 02:09:18.484
TERRIBLE TERM HE WAS I THINK SO

02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:20.886
MUCH OPEN SPECULATION ON THAT.

02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:23.021
I WOULD REFER YOU TO GEORGIA.

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:25.691
WHICH HAS A VERY SPECIFIC-

02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:27.092
FRAMEWORK FOR RECALL HERE'S

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:30.896
WHAT. IT SAYS AND I'M READY TO

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:31.463
VERBATIM QUOTE. I RECALL WAS

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:32.931
TRIGGERED BY QUOTE AN ACT MELFI.

02:09:32.998 --> 02:09:35.667
OR MISCONDUCT. OFFICE VIOLATION

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:36.869
OF THE OATH OF OFFICE FAILURE

02:09:36.935 --> 02:09:38.637
TO PERFORM DUTIES PRESCRIBED BY

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:40.139
LAW OR WILLFULLY MISUSING

02:09:40.205 --> 02:09:40.973
CONVERTING ARE

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:42.274
MISAPPROPRIATING. WITHOUT

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:43.642

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.077
PUBLIC FUNDS ENTRUSTED TO

ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTIVE

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:48.180
OFFICE. TO WHICH THE OFFICIAL

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:50.115
HAS BEEN ELECTED OR APPOINTED.

02:09:50.182 --> 02:09:51.350
IN OTHER WORDS THIS- POINTS

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:52.851
MORE TO ACTS IN OFFICE MORE

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:54.186
THAN JUST I DON'T LIKE THE WAY

02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:55.888
THE GOVERNOR LOOKS I JUST DON'T

02:09:55.954 --> 02:09:56.955
LIKE THE PARTY HERE SHE BELONGS

02:09:57.022 --> 02:09:59.024
TO. AND PERHAPS YOU ALSO WANT

02:09:59.091 --> 02:10:00.592
TO CONSIDER CREATING A YOU KNOW

02:10:00.659 --> 02:10:02.127
A PANEL OF RETIRED JUDGES TO

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.795
VET THE CONSTITUTIONALITY.

02:10:03.862 --> 02:10:05.364
RECALL EFFORT NUMBER TWO IF YOU

02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:06.598
HAVE TO. EXPLAIN WHY THE

02:10:06.665 --> 02:10:08.400
GOVERNOR SHOULD BE RECALLED

02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:10.068
THEN PERHAPS A BODY INDEPENDENT

02:10:10.135 --> 02:10:11.370
BODY SHOULD REVIEW WHETHER NOT

02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:13.105
IS GOING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.873
AS IT BIGELOW JUDGE ANYWAY. AND

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.341
THEN THE OTHER AREA TRY TURN

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:18.510
YOU TO- IT WOULD BE THE TIMING.

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:21.747
MATTERS IF YOU LOOK A WITH ALL

02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:23.649
SORTS **** CAME INTO OFFICE. IN

02:10:23.715 --> 02:10:25.350
NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND THREE HE

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:26.752
HAD THREE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:28.820
HOW TO RUN THE STATE. MAKE AN

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:31.156
ARGUMENT FOR RE ELECTION. IF

02:10:31.223 --> 02:10:31.690
GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAD BEEN

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:33.625
RECALLED AND LARRY ELDER

02:10:33.692 --> 02:10:35.060
WHOEVER WOULD HAVE STEPPED IN.

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:37.362
HE WOULD HAVE HAD JUST A FEW

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:39.097
MONTHS TO NUMBER ONE FIGURE OUT

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.999
HOW TO WRITE A BUDGET. NUMBER

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:42.167
TO INTRODUCE A LEGISLATIVE

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:43.936
AGENDA WHICH PROBABLY WOULD

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:44.469
HAVE BEEN DEAD ON ARRIVAL

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:46.672
LEGISLATURE. ENDS WITHIN A FEW

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:47.940
MONTHS OF TAKING OFFICE LOOKING

02:10:48.006 --> 02:10:49.441
AT A PRIMARY AND IF YOU DIDN'T

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:50.475
FINISH AT LEAST SECOND IN THE

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:52.444
PRIMARY HE WAS A POLITICAL LAME

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:54.346
DUCK. SO I THINK WE NEED TO

02:10:54.413 --> 02:10:56.882
CONSIDER THE TIMING OF UP. A

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:59.151
RECALL EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:10:59.218 --> 02:10:59.785
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:01.620
GOVERNOR NEWSOM- THREE RECALL

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:02.888
EFFORTS WERE FILED AGAINST IT

GOVERNOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

TWENTY NINETEEN- THESE TO ME

02:11:18.136 --> 02:11:19.071
THE EQUIVALENT OF FRIVOLOUS

02:11:19.137 --> 02:11:20.639
LAWSUITS BECAUSE HE REALLY JUST

02:11:20.706 --> 02:11:22.407
GOING AFTER. THE PARTY MORE

02:11:22.474 --> 02:11:24.076
THAN ANYTHING ELSE NEW JERSEY

02:11:24.142 --> 02:11:25.410
HAS A PREVENTION IT WHICH ON

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:26.778
THE RECALL PROCESS MAY NOT

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:33.385
BEGIN UNTIL FIFTY DAYS BEFORE.

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:33.852
THE COMPLETION OF THE

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:34.453
INCUMBENTS FIRST YEAR. OF THE

02:11:34.519 --> 02:11:35.020
CURRENT TERM IN OFFICE MAYBE

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:35.754
CAO. SHOULD CONSIDER THAT AS A

02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:36.955
WAY TO KIND OF JUST. THE NATURE

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:38.523
RECALLED AND THEN MAYBE KILL.

02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:39.157
NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING

02:11:39.224 --> 02:11:40.158
ON THE BACK AND PERHAPS YOU

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:41.660
CANNOT HAVE A RECALL AFTER AN

02:11:41.727 --> 02:11:43.595
INCUMBENT IS IT MIDWAY. THROUGH

02:11:43.662 --> 02:11:45.063
THEIR TERM THAT WAY YOU GET

02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:46.498

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:49.067
UPCYCLED A TON. A WIN FOR THE

02:11:49.134 --> 02:11:49.668
PAST RECALL WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:51.770
LOOKING AT. IF I SOUND LIKE A

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.405
TILT IN FAVOR THE EXECUTIVE I

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:54.906
PLEAD GUILTY I'VE WORKED FOR

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:57.342
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR- IT'S A

02:11:57.409 --> 02:11:57.976
TOUGH ENOUGH JOB WITHOUT

02:11:58.043 --> 02:11:59.945
DISTRACTIONS. IRRITANTS FOR

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:00.979
EXAMPLE I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO

02:12:01.046 --> 02:12:02.514
CHANGE PROVISION WHICH

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BECOMES THE

02:12:03.348 --> 02:12:04.716
ACTING GOVERNOR. THE GOVERNOR

LET'S KEEP THE RECALL PROCESS

IT HONORS THE STATE'S LEGACY OF

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:11.556
THE POLITICAL CLASS BEING HELD

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:12.958
ACCOUNTABLE. BUT YES IT'S

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:14.293
CONSIDER WAYS TO MAKE THIS EVEN

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:16.161
MORE EXCEPTIONAL AND MORE RARE.

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.562

PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS ABOUT MANY

WITH YOU ABOUT THE LIEUTENANT

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.127
GOVERNOR. JUST BECAUSE THE

02:12:49.194 --> 02:12:50.329
GOVERNOR LEADS THE STATE IS

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:51.697
THAT. THERE'S NO PHONE PHONE

02:12:51.763 --> 02:12:54.266
ACCESS I GUESS- PROCESS LIKE

02:12:54.333 --> 02:12:54.866
WE'VE KIND OF GOTTEN A LITTLE

02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:57.002
BETTER THERE. BUT SO I WANT TO

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:58.370
INVITE A COLLEAGUES TO ASK

02:12:58.437 --> 02:12:59.905

PANELISTS. TWO WEEKS. AT THE

THE- BONTA TOUCH BUILT ON THE

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:14.353
GROUNDS FOR THE RECALL.

02:13:14.419 --> 02:13:17.856
CALIFORNIA NOW IS IT WOULD BE

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.358
THE MORE ONEROUS STATE OR AT

02:13:19.424 --> 02:13:23.095
LEAST LESSER AREN'T OWNER STATE

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:26.765
ON TERMS OF GROUNDS FOR RECALL.

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:28.033
IS CALIFORNIA RIGHT DON'T

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:30.669
LISTEN MORE OWNERS I DON'T

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:34.206
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION OKAY.

02:13:34.272 --> 02:13:36.375
DID THAT CALIPHATES CALIFORNIA

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:39.378
REALLY VERY. RESTRICTIVE IN

02:13:39.444 --> 02:13:42.848
TERMS OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED.

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:44.750
FOUR RECALLING OR ARE WE VERY

02:13:44.816 --> 02:13:46.518
VERY GENEROUS MAKING IT MORE

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:49.254
MODESTY. WE'RE PRETTY WIDE OPEN

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:50.822
UNDERSTAND YOU CAN JUST PUT

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:52.124
YOUR COMPLAINTS ON THE BALLOT

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:53.158
IN A WHERE YOU GO AND IF YOU

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:54.526
LOOK AT THE YOU LOOK AT THE

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:55.627
LAST VEHICLE AGAINST GOVERNOR

02:13:55.694 --> 02:13:57.596
NEWSOM WAS RATHER FAMILIAR LIST

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.097
OF COMPLAINTS BY THE PARTY THAT

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:00.699
OPPOSES HIM IN TERMS OF- HIS

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:03.268
ACTIONS ON THE DEATH PENALTY IN

02:14:03.335 --> 02:14:05.303
TERMS OF IMMIGRATION POLICY. HM

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:07.672
SO. YOU KNOW THE DEEP SET SPEED

02:14:07.739 --> 02:14:08.840
RIGHT THAT'S CONCERT IS

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:09.441
INTERPRETING THE GOVERNMENT'S

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:10.976
NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. I JUST

02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:12.377
THINK THAT YOU NEED TO ADD A

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:13.345
COMPONENT TO IT WHICH REALLY

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:15.580
GETS TO THE IDEA OF MALFEASANCE

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.048
AND JUST NOT PERFORMING HER JOB

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.417
PROPERLY. BECAUSE WE CAN ALL

02:14:18.483 --> 02:14:20.419
DISAGREE. ON POLICY CHOICES AND

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:21.953
FRANKLY I THINK THAT'S WHAT

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:22.921
REGULAR SCHEDULE ELECTIONS ARE

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:25.190
FOR. BUT ISN'T THAT. TO BE

02:14:25.257 --> 02:14:28.894
LITIGATED HEAVILY MALFEASANCE

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.228
IT MEANS DIFFERENT THANKS.

02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:32.998
RIGHT THAT'S WHY I THINK FIFTY.

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:33.765
RIGHT IT DOES BUT I THINK IT

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:35.167
REALLY GETS DOWN TO A QUESTION

02:14:35.233 --> 02:14:36.268
OF CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:38.370
OFFICE. AND WITH THE GOVERNOR

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:40.038
LET'S SAY DOES SOMETHING THAT

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.673
YOU OPPOSED TO PHILOSOPHICALLY

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.808
I'M NOT SURE THAT REALLY MEANS

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:43.775
OF THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:44.910
RECALLED FROM HIS OFFICE AGAIN

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.411
I THINK WE HAVE A SEAT GARDEN

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:48.513
THAT'S CALLED AN ELECTION.

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.549
REGULAR SCHEDULE H. WE DO WE DO

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:53.952
HAVE THAT FOR SURE. YES AND YOU

02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:54.453
KNOW IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:14:54.519 --> 02:14:59.024
ELECTION. THE PROPONENTS DID

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:00.292
NOT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY DID

02:15:00.358 --> 02:15:01.893
NOT HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES

02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:03.995
EITHER TO QUALIFY AND MOST

02:15:04.062 --> 02:15:06.565
CERTAINLY NOT TO CAMPAIGN FOR.

02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:08.300
GOVERNOR HAD ALMOST UNLIMITED

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:11.136
RESOURCES THE NEW CAMPAIGN.

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:14.239
AGAIN RIGHT AND A LOT OF THEM

02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:16.408
CAME FROM NONTRADITIONAL

02:15:16.475 --> 02:15:18.577
DEMOCRATIC SOURCES FOR THEIR

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:20.445
OWN REASONS WHATEVER THOSE WERE

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:22.481
THEY CONTRIBUTED HEAVILY. TO

02:15:22.547 --> 02:15:26.051
RELISH THE RECALL SHALL I BRING

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:27.886
THAT TO POINT TO BEAR JUST THAT

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:31.389
THERE'S A BALANCING OF FACTORS.

02:15:31.456 --> 02:15:32.591
ASCENDED TO QUALIFY HOW

02:15:32.657 --> 02:15:34.192
DIFFICULT IT IS TO QUALIFY HOW

02:15:34.259 --> 02:15:36.161
DIFFICULT IT IS TO IN FACT

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.463
RECALL WHAT GROUNDS FOR THE

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:41.066
RECALL WOULD BE. THE REASON I

02:15:41.132 --> 02:15:43.168
OFFER THOSE OBSERVATIONS IS I'M

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:44.870
I'M RGUING I DON'T THINK THAT

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:46.438
THERE'S ANYTHING O AGREE

02:15:46.505 --> 02:15:48.707
JUSTLY BROKEN IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:51.409
SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:55.080
IT MISTER CARILLO FURTHER

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:58.483
ALLUDED TO THAT WITH 96% DO NOT

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.419
EVEN QUALIFY- GRATEFUL THAT

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:02.687
SHOWS IT'S PRETTY TOUGH IN

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:06.458
CALIFORNIA TO DO A RECALL. AND

02:16:06.525 --> 02:16:08.093
SAY WHATEVER YOU WILL ABOUT

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.529
HAVING THE OVER WHATEVER YEARS

02:16:10.595 --> 02:16:12.998
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN MUCH. SO I

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:14.533
WOULD SAY THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:16.167
BEEN PRETTY RESPONSIBLE AND

02:16:16.234 --> 02:16:18.436
REASONABLE OVER THE YEARS. BUT

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:21.139
IN ALL AREAS WE SPEND WAY TOO

02:16:21.206 --> 02:16:23.341
MUCH MONEY IN ELECTIONS. AND

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.710
MAYBE. CAMPAIGN FINANCE

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:29.014
LIMITATIONS IN THE CAMPAIGN

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:31.149
PORTION. OF THIS WOULD BE IN

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:33.184
ORDER DO YOU SEE WHAT YOUR

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.686
RIGHTS ARE. YOU RESULTS IN

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:35.754
QUESTION PERHAPS WE NEED TO

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:36.688
CONSIDER RUNNING OUT THE

02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:38.657
GOVERNOR EVEN IF HE OR SHE IS A

02:16:38.723 --> 02:16:40.825
SUBJECT TO RECALL SHOULD HAVE

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.861
TO COMPLY BY. CALIFORNIA

02:16:42.928 --> 02:16:44.529
CAMPAIGN DONATION LIMITS

02:16:44.596 --> 02:16:46.231
BECAUSE IT DOES OPEN UP IN A

02:16:46.298 --> 02:16:47.866
COUPLE QUESTION WHICH IS IF I

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:49.334
GIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO

02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:50.502
THE GOVERNOR'S RE ELECTED

02:16:50.569 --> 02:16:54.105
GOVERNORS ALL. QUID PRO QUO

02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:54.706
POLITICS WHAT I'M EXPECTING IN

02:16:54.773 --> 02:16:58.276
RETURN. WELL IF IT DID THERE

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:00.278
CERTAINLY. COULD BE ALLUDED TO

02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:02.514
THAT INDEED AND I DO MAKE THE

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:05.984
POINT. THAT THE PROJECT THERE'S

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:08.720
A CHECK AND BALANCE THAT.

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:09.921
PROPONENTS USUALLY TO RECALL.

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:11.790
DO NOT HAVE MANY RESOURCES

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:13.124
TOGETHER SIGNATURES THEY

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.593
CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.795
AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO HIRE.

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.863
SIGNATURE GATHERERS. BUT IT

02:17:18.930 --> 02:17:20.265
COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.200
CAMPAIGN FOR ONE WHO IS AN

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:23.802
ELECTIVE OFFICE OF THE LEVERAGE

02:17:23.868 --> 02:17:26.171
THEIR IN THE INHERENT- TO BE

02:17:26.237 --> 02:17:29.307
ABLE TO RAISE MONEY. FOR THAT

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:31.543
RECALL EFFORT SHALL DIE I WILL

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.544
WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:33.812
LET'S TAKE THESE THINGS ALL IN

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:36.247
CONTEXT AND WEIGH THEM AGAINST

02:17:36.314 --> 02:17:37.582
EACH OTHER NOT JUST MAKE THE

02:17:37.649 --> 02:17:40.418
EXCEPTION THAT DOESN'T AGREE

02:17:40.485 --> 02:17:41.553
JUST PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.054
THANK THERE'S CLEARLY NOT IN

02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:45.023
THE GREGIS PROBLEM. THERE MAY

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:47.325
BE SOME FINE TUNING IN ORDER.

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:49.594
BUT NOT AN EGREGIOUS PROBLEM.

02:17:49.661 --> 02:17:50.895
AN IMPORTANT THING IS TO

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:53.031
REMEMBER RATHER HOW THEY DID

02:17:53.098 --> 02:17:54.799
NOT WORK CALYXT ORDINARILY WELL

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:57.302
IT HAS WORKED FOR THE DECADES

02:17:57.369 --> 02:17:59.571
INSURING. THE CITIZENS THEIR

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:01.573
VOICE THROUGH THE INITIATIVE

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:03.842
THE REFERENDUM ON THE RECALL. I

02:18:03.908 --> 02:18:06.645
KNOW THAT'S A GOOD. THANK YOU

YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S HAVE A

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:13.284
LITTLE FUN HERE FOR A MOMENT-

02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:14.586
LET'S SAY THAT THE RECALL

02:18:14.653 --> 02:18:16.621
HAPPEN AND GOVERNOR USES FIRST

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:19.724
YEAR VERSUS IS THIRTY YEAR. AND

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:21.726
OUT OF THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:22.327
TODAY MISTER ELDER BECOMES THE

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:25.497
GOVERNOR. SO AND IT ONE OF THE

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:26.564
THINGS I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:28.700
THIS DISCUSSION A RECALL REFORM

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:29.334
IS THAT IT'S ONCE AGAIN PUT IN

02:18:29.401 --> 02:18:31.136
A POLITICAL PRISM OF THE

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:32.871
MOMENT. BUT LET'S SAY UNDER

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:35.774
THIS SCENARIO- THE GET NOW

CHOICE. OF GUNS RIGHT. OF

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:46.518
OFFSHORE OIL OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:47.852
HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT WOULD

02:18:47.919 --> 02:18:48.787
HAVE BEEN FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO

02:18:48.853 --> 02:18:51.089
TAKE A LESS THAN A YEAR'S WORTH

02:18:51.156 --> 02:18:51.990
OF DECISIONS ARE EXECUTIVE

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:54.025

AS YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO. THERE

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:07.572
WOULD BE NO THERE IS NO REASON

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:09.007
WHY THE DEMOCRATS WOULD WANT TO.

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:10.542
REVISIT THAT ELECTION AGAIN

02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:12.077
WHEN YOU SUGGEST GIVEN. HIS

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:14.746
ELECTION IN A RECALL THAT MIGHT

02:19:14.813 --> 02:19:15.280
HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS THAN A

02:19:15.346 --> 02:19:17.716
MAJORITY VOTE. THERE WOULD BE

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.484
MULTIPLE RECALL EFFORTS AGAINST

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:20.785
REGARDLESS BECAUSE I THINK THIS

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:22.053
IS THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.689
POLITICS ARE RIGHT NOW- PETE

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:25.824
WILSON HAD EIGHT RECALL

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:27.358
ATTEMPTS AGAINST HIM CHORE TO

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:29.394
BEIJING HAD ELEVEN. JERRY BROWN

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:31.529
HAD FIVE GAVIN NEWSOM'S HAD SIX

02:19:31.596 --> 02:19:33.264
SO FOR AN AVERAGE OF TWO YEARS

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:34.432
SO HE MY SHATTER THE RECORD

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:36.267
SO. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF LARRY

02:19:36.334 --> 02:19:37.702
ELDER WERE IN OFFICE YOU WOULD

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:39.304
SEE MULTIPLE RECALL EFFORTS THE

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:41.473
QUESTION WOULD BE. HOW MANY

02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:42.707
HELP IF ANY OF THEM WOULD

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:44.576
ACTUALLY REACH THE THRESHOLD OF

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:45.510
GETTING ON THE BALLOT THAT

02:19:45.577 --> 02:19:47.112
SUGGESTS THE GIVEN HOW MANY

02:19:47.178 --> 02:19:48.313
MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS ARE IN

02:19:48.379 --> 02:19:49.714
CALIFORNIA. WOULD NOT BE HARD

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:51.883
TO QUALIFY. THE RECALL EFFORT

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.017
IF YOU JUST HAVE THE TIME IN

02:19:53.084 --> 02:19:54.152
THE MUSCLE TO PUT BEHIND IT AND

02:19:54.219 --> 02:19:55.153
THERE'S ENOUGH MUSCLE

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.021
CALIFORNIA DO THAT SO. I THINK

02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:58.223
WE WOULD LOOK AT A SITUATION

02:19:58.289 --> 02:19:59.157
WHERE THE PROBABLY WOULD'VE

02:19:59.224 --> 02:19:59.724
BEEN A RECALL ELECTION THE

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:01.393
FOLLOWING YEAR AND JUST YOU

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:02.527
KNOW THIS IS NOT A LOT OF WHAT

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:03.661
GOOD WAY TO RUN A REAL WORLD IS

02:20:03.728 --> 02:20:07.198
NOT A GOOD. WAY TO RUN

02:20:07.265 --> 02:20:08.833
GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU FOR A- AT.

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.001
ABOUT HYPE OF. BUT NOT SO FAR

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.770
OFF HYPOTHETICAL UNDER THAT. IN

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:13.138
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I WANT TO

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:14.839
BRING BACK UP FOR A- PROFESSOR

02:20:14.906 --> 02:20:17.742
CARILLO. A PROFESSOR CARILLO.

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:18.910
USED AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:20.278
CONCERNS ABOUT A SIGNATURE

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:21.713
CHANGE THE ISSUE OF THE COST

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.681
PER SIGNATURE. BASED ON I GUESS

02:20:23.748 --> 02:20:25.717
I'LL STARKELDATA. THAT YOU

02:20:25.784 --> 02:20:27.685
HAVE LOOKED AT IN THAT SPACE.

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:29.020
BUT I WANT TO BRING YOU TO THE

02:20:29.087 --> 02:20:30.922
TWO RECALLS THAT WE HAVE JUST

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:32.157
EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST TWENTY

02:20:32.223 --> 02:20:34.225
YEARS- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:20:34.292 --> 02:20:36.394
COST PER- PER SIGNATURE WAS ON

02:20:36.461 --> 02:20:37.595
THE RECALL THAT WE JUST WENT

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:41.599
THROUGH. IN- IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:20:41.666 --> 02:20:42.634
ONE. YES I BELIEVE IT WAS IN

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.402
THE FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLAR RANGE

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:46.271
AND FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:46.871
HISTORICALLY AND BELIEVES IN

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.573
THE TO THE THREE DOLLAR RANGE.

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:49.908
RIGHT BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

02:20:49.974 --> 02:20:52.110
THE PRO RECALL SUPPORTERS SPENT

02:20:52.177 --> 02:20:54.445
OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS T

02:20:54.512 --> 02:20:55.013
QUALIFY THAT MEASURE FOR THE

02:20:55.079 --> 02:20:58.316
BALLOT. IN ONE. AND THIS IS

02:20:58.383 --> 02:21:00.218
BASED ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS MY

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:01.085
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WAS AN

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:03.354
ALL VOLUNTEER EFFORT UP UNTIL

02:21:03.421 --> 02:21:04.189
THE POINT THAT THEY GOT AN

02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:05.790
EXTENSION OF TIME. AND AT THAT

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:07.091
POINT THEY GOT AN INFUSION OF

02:21:07.158 --> 02:21:08.993
CASH IN IT I THINK IF YOU LOOK

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:09.894
AT THE RULING COUNT OF

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:11.830
SIGNATURES. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

02:21:11.896 --> 02:21:13.031
THAT DURING THE VOLUNTEER

02:21:13.097 --> 02:21:15.633
PERIOD ABSENT THE EXTENSION

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:16.367
THEY WERE NOT ON PACE TO

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:18.469
QUALIFY. IT WAS THE FACT THAT

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:21.739
THE EXTENSION HAPPENED AND THEN

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:22.307
THE MOMENT CAME IN THOSE TWO

02:21:22.373 --> 02:21:23.208
THINGS COMBINED. ALLOWED THEM

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:24.709
TOGETHER ENOUGH SIGNATURES.

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:26.044
RIGHT BUT WHAT IS THE RECORD

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:27.545
SHALL AND HOW MUCH THEY REYES

02:21:27.612 --> 02:21:29.614
TO QUALIFY THE RECALL FOR THE

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:30.215
BALLOT WHAT ARE THE FACTS SHOW

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:32.817
THEIR- THAT I DON'T KNOW I

02:21:32.884 --> 02:21:33.384
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WITH THE

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.053
ULTIMATE REYES WAS. OKAY

02:21:35.119 --> 02:21:37.288
BECAUSE I WOULD WELCOME THAT-

02:21:37.355 --> 02:21:38.790
THAT INFORMATION TO THE

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:39.424
COMMITTEE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:41.226
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. SO THE

02:21:41.292 --> 02:21:43.461
PROGRESS. YEAH WITHOUT BUT

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:44.596
BECAUSE THE PREMISE OF YOUR

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:46.331
CONCERNS IS THAT IT'S SEVEN

02:21:46.397 --> 02:21:47.999
DOLLARS A SIGNATUREYET. IN

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.400
THIS LATEST RECALL WAS EVEN

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:50.635
CLOSE TO SEVEN DOLLARS A

02:21:50.702 --> 02:21:51.636
SIGNATUR THAT I'M JUST KIND

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:54.038
OF. TRY TO GET THE FACTS ON ON

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:55.273
THE PREMISE THAT YOU'RE SETTING

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.541
THE FOUNDATION FOR WHY YOU'RE

02:21:56.608 --> 02:21:58.142
CONCERNED ABOUT. RAISING THAT

02:21:58.209 --> 02:22:00.411
SIGNATURE LIMIT. IT'S NOT A ONE

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:01.713
TO ONE COMPARISON BECAUSE AS I

02:22:01.779 --> 02:22:03.448
SAID THIS THIS RECALL EFFORT

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:04.983
WAS SPLIT YOU KNOW IT'S A

02:22:05.049 --> 02:22:06.584
HYBRID OF WHAT WILL BE TAKE

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:07.986
WHICH HERE IS THAT. THE COST

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:09.220
INVOLVED IT'S VERY IS

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.555
PROHIBITIVELY DIFFICULT FOR

02:22:10.622 --> 02:22:12.090
EVERYONE TO HEAR SIGNATURE

02:22:12.156 --> 02:22:14.559
GATHERING EFFORT. TO SUCCEED IN

02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:15.593
QUALIFYING A RECALL FOR THE

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.462
BALLOT AND EVEN REMOTELY

02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:19.130
QUALIFIED TO THINK THIS TWENTY

02:22:19.197 --> 02:22:19.731
TWENTY ONE RECALL IT IS AN

02:22:19.797 --> 02:22:21.099
EXAMPLE OF THAT APPROVED A

02:22:21.165 --> 02:22:22.233
POINT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ON

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:24.002
PACE. ABSENT THE EXTENSION OF

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:25.169
TIME WHICH THEN BROUGHT IN

02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:26.871
NATIONAL MONEY THAT ALLOWED

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:28.306
THEM TO PAY SIGNATURE GATHERERS

02:22:28.373 --> 02:22:32.510
SO THAT'S. OPPOSED TO THINGS

02:22:32.577 --> 02:22:33.144
THAT THEY WERE TO FAIL. YEAH SO

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:34.045
I. THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.480
GETTING THE FACTS ON EXACTLY

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.548
HOW MUCH WAS. SPENT TO QUALIFY

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.783
THE SIGNATURES BECAUSE IT DOES

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:40.518
GO TO THE HEART THE PREMISE OF.

02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:41.986
THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU PROVIDED

02:22:42.053 --> 02:22:43.821
TO US TODAY JERRY BERMAN OF A

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:45.690
FOLLOW UP QUESTION YES SO. THE

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:46.324
COUPLE THOUGHTS REALLY

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:47.692
APPRECIATE BOTH PRESENTATIONS I

02:22:47.759 --> 02:22:48.993
MEAN I DON'T YOU THAT THE FOR

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:50.561
THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT ON.

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.997
PACE TO QUALIFY. WHAT WAS

02:22:53.064 --> 02:22:55.500
REALLY JUST. A KIND OF A- THE

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:56.634
SIGNAL OF WHAT WE EVENTUALLY

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:58.436
SAW. WHICH IS THAT IT FAILED

02:22:58.503 --> 02:23:00.738
SPECTACULARLY RIGHT IT GOT 38%

02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:02.674
OF THE VOTE WE SPENT THE STATE

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:03.574
SPENT ALMOST THREEHUNDRED

02:23:03.641 --> 02:23:05.243
MILLION DOLLARS- AND HAVE A

02:23:05.310 --> 02:23:07.211
MASSIVEAMOUNT OF DISTRACTION.

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:08.947
TO OUR OUR GOVERNING PROCESS

02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:10.148
FOR SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY DID

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:12.550
NOT HAVE A MAJORITY SUPPORT- OF

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:14.285
CALIFORNIANS AND SO WHAT I

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:15.053
WOULD LOVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT

02:23:15.119 --> 02:23:18.256
A PROCESS. BY WHERE YOU NEED

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:20.358
THE PROCESS TO QUALIFY. SHOW

02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:21.592
SOME SORT OF CERTAINTY THAT

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:22.360
YOU'RE AT LEAST GOING TO GET

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:23.895
CLOSE. YOU KNOW IT DOES HAVE

02:23:23.962 --> 02:23:25.229
THE GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE GOING

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:26.731
TO GET A MAJORITY OF THE VOTE.

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:28.666
TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR- OR THE

02:23:28.733 --> 02:23:30.601
ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT IT SHOWS

02:23:30.668 --> 02:23:31.736
THAT. YOU'RE AT LEAST GOING TO

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:33.338
BE COMPETITIVE I AM TRYING TO

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:34.872
MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND THAT

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:36.074
THERE IS A CLOSE TO A MAJORITY

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:37.642
OFPEOPLE IN A JURISDICTION TO

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:40.945
AGREE WITH YOU- A ABOUT IT. I

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:42.714
ALSO WONDER YOU KNOW WHENEVER

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:43.414
YOU RECALL PROCESS WAS

02:23:43.481 --> 02:23:45.350
ESTABLISHED. IN ADDITION

02:23:45.416 --> 02:23:46.184
WITHOUT A DIRECT DEMOCRACY

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:48.619
POLICIES BY. YOU KNOW- THE

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:50.021
FUTURE GOVERNOR JEB- HIRAM

02:23:50.088 --> 02:23:51.289
JOHNSON. THE HUNDRED TEN YEARS

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:55.326
AGO. I CAN'T IMAGINE HE WAS.

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:56.427
FIGURE YOU KNOW DETERMINING THE

02:23:56.494 --> 02:23:57.829
POLICIES BASED ON PAID

02:23:57.895 --> 02:23:59.597
SIGNATURE GATHERERS FOREIGN

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:01.432
EFFORT. I THINK THE IDEA IS

02:24:01.499 --> 02:24:02.467
THAT THERE'S A POPULAR

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:04.802
UPRISING- AND THAT THEREFORE.

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:06.738
WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS

02:24:06.804 --> 02:24:07.739
THE STATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:10.108
HAVE THE- URGENCY AND ENERGY

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:12.110
AND INTEREST- TO VOLUNTEER

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:12.977
THEIR TIME TO COLLECT

02:24:13.044 --> 02:24:14.278
SIGNATURES IN YOUR AYE I

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:15.313
TOTALLY AGREE THAT THAT MIGHT

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:17.215
NOT BE. THAT MIGHT NOT GET TO A

02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:18.683
100% OF THE WAY THERE. BUT

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:20.418
THAT'S TO BE A SIGNIFICANT.

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:22.053
PART OF THE SIGNATURE GAHERING

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:24.155
PROCESS AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:24.622
CAP IT OFF WITH PAID

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:27.091
SIGNATURES- TO GET OVER THE

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:28.793
HUMP. YOU KNOW THEN THEN THEN

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:30.595
THAT'S VALID BUT I DON'T

02:24:30.661 --> 02:24:31.596
NECESSARILY THINK WE SHOULD DO

02:24:31.662 --> 02:24:33.464
AN ANALYSIS THAT ASSUMES. THAT

02:24:33.531 --> 02:24:34.766
EVERY SIGNATURE THAT IS

02:24:34.832 --> 02:24:36.567
GATHERED NEEDS TO BE DONE BY.

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:38.669
BY PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS. SO

02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:39.804
THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE MORE OF

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:42.140
A- APPOINTED A HAPPY THAT TO

02:24:42.206 --> 02:24:43.608
HAVE FOLKS COMMENTS- BUT WAS

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:46.310
REALLY ALSO. KIND OF IMPRESSED

02:24:46.377 --> 02:24:48.880
BY. SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM

02:24:48.946 --> 02:24:50.381
ISRAEL AND- THAT WERE VERY

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:51.549
SIMILAR MISTER WILL YOU DON'T

02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:53.051

DISSATISFACTION WITH THE

HIS AUTHORITY NOW. IN PART THAT

02:28:31.102 --> 02:28:33.271
IS A PART OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:35.206
BECAUSE FOR DECADES. MOST

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:36.641
RECENTLY THE LAST TEN YEARS

02:28:36.707 --> 02:28:38.876
THAT I'VE BEEN BACK. THE

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:40.911
LEGISLATURE REGULARLY HAS SHE

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:42.580
AND THE PEOPLE'S AUTHORITY TO

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:43.781
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF

02:28:43.848 --> 02:28:45.216
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE UNILATERAL

02:28:45.283 --> 02:28:48.185
DECISIONS. MOST RECENTLY IN THE

02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:50.788
LAST BUDGET. A PROVISION

02:28:50.855 --> 02:28:52.657
FORTUNATELY THAT WAS REMOVED

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:54.725
THAT SAID MONIES THAT COULD BE

02:28:54.792 --> 02:28:57.028
EXPANDED FOR FORCED A WILDLAND

02:28:57.094 --> 02:28:59.730
PROTECTION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:01.299
THE APPROVAL OF THE DEBATE THAT

02:29:01.365 --> 02:29:02.166
THE DETERMINATION OF THE

02:29:02.233 --> 02:29:04.602
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IT

02:29:04.669 --> 02:29:06.237
WAS QUOTE NEEDED. NOW THAT'S

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:09.674
CLEARLY. USURPING AUTHORITY BUT

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:11.509
THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPRESSLY

02:29:11.575 --> 02:29:13.244
BEEN GIVEN MORE AUTHORITY TO

02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:14.879
GOVERNORS AND GOVERNORS AND

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:17.081
PRESIDENTS BOTH PARTIES. HAVE

02:29:17.148 --> 02:29:19.350
EXERCISED THEIR AUTHORITY I

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:21.552
THINK BEYOND WHAT THEY SHOULD.

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.487
IT'S RIGHT LET AT THE IMPROPER

02:29:23.554 --> 02:29:24.722
THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD BE

02:29:24.789 --> 02:29:26.090
UPSET ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT

02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:28.559
WAS A BIGGER FACTORED IN THE

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:29.994
NUMBERS OF SIGNATURES THAT WERE

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:33.064
REQUIRED. THAN ANYTHING ELSE

02:29:33.130 --> 02:29:36.167
THE POLICY. THERE PROBABLY WERE

02:29:36.233 --> 02:29:37.568
PLENTY OF THE OCEAN BUT I THINK

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:38.803
THE PUBLIC IS GETTING PRETTY

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:40.638
FED UP. WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:42.106

THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:48.012
AGENCIES USURPING THEIR POWER

02:29:48.079 --> 02:29:49.780
OR STARTING THEIR POWER.

02:29:49.847 --> 02:29:51.349
THROUGH UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:52.917

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:00.825
EXAMPLES EVEN THE ONES THAT YOU

02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:03.327
ARE CITING IN WHICH THE REMEDY

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:04.628
WAS THROUGH THE COURTS TO

02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:06.263
CHALLENGE THOSE DECISIONS AND

02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.165
IN SOME CASES THEY WERE. THEY

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.433
WERE REVERSED SO THERE WAS

02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:11.602
REMEDIES WITHIN THE LAW ABSENT

02:30:11.669 --> 02:30:15.139

THROUGH A GROUP THAT MR WHELAN

02:30:21.278 --> 02:30:23.481

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:32.423
WHICH WE SHOULD USE TODAY- OR

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING

02:32:55.666 --> 02:32:58.869
ME- I CAN'T STAY ON PASSED

02:32:58.936 --> 02:33:00.104
ABOUT THREE FORTY SO I DON'T

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:01.438
KNOW IF THAT AFFECTS HOW YOU

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:03.641
WANNA TAKE THE QUESTIONS SO YOU

02:33:03.707 --> 02:33:04.808
ASK ME OF COURSE TO SPEAK ABOUT

02:33:04.875 --> 02:33:06.076
SOMETHING PRETTY NARROW WHICH

02:33:06.143 --> 02:33:08.178
IS JUST THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:33:08.245 --> 02:33:09.847
THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES AND

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:11.315
I'M GONNA START BY SAYING

02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:12.783
SOMETHING MAYBE KIND OF

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:14.084
SUBVERSIVE ANYTHING TO MISTER

02:33:14.151 --> 02:33:16.086
MCPHERSON'S POINT ARTIST

02:33:16.153 --> 02:33:17.321
QUESTION WHICH IS I ACTUALLY

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:18.355
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:20.291
REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES I THINK

02:33:20.357 --> 02:33:22.426
THAT WE IF WE HAVE A RECALL AND

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:24.061
IT TO BE A LOT HARDER HARDER TO

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:26.363
HAVE A RECALLS THEN WE SHOULD

02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:27.965
GO THROUGH AN APPOINTMENT

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:30.334
PROCESS OR IN THE CASE. OF A

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:32.102
GOVERNOR BEING RECALLED WE

02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:32.803
SHOULD GO THROUGH THE

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:34.805
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND I'LL

02:33:34.872 --> 02:33:36.874
MAKE MY POINTS REALLY BRIEF

02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:38.342
AFTER THIS BUT I'LL JUST SAY

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:39.643
YOU KNOW I LISTEN TO A LOT OF

02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:41.445
THE TESTIMONY SO FAR OBVIOUSLY

02:33:41.512 --> 02:33:44.648
REALLY USEFUL AND- I WOULD SAY

02:33:44.715 --> 02:33:47.051
IS THE RECALL. YOU KNOW A

02:33:47.117 --> 02:33:49.186
REALLY SCREWED UP SYSTEM TO USE

02:33:49.253 --> 02:33:52.289
A LEGAL TERM ABSOLUTELY IS IT

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:55.593
WORTH FIXING I'M NOT ENTIRELY

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:56.827
CLEAR ON THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:58.395
AT THE NUMBERS OF HOW OFTEN WE

02:33:58.462 --> 02:33:59.930
USE IT AND HOW OFTEN IT

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:01.966
SUCCESSFUL SO IS THIS THE

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:03.334
SYSTEM YOU WOULD EVER WANT TO

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:04.902
USE AND DESIGN IN A MILLION

02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:07.338
YEARS NOW IS THIS THE SYSTEM

02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:08.772
THAT WE SHOULD REALLY SPEND A

02:34:08.839 --> 02:34:10.207
LOT OF TIME TRYING TO REFORM

02:34:10.274 --> 02:34:11.008
BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S A

02:34:11.075 --> 02:34:12.843
CHANCE OF THIS ACTUALLY PASSING

02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:14.678
ON THE BALLOT. PROBABLY NOT

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:16.113
LET'S REMEMBER IF THERE'S ONE

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:18.682
THING THAT TENDS TO UNITE OUR

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:20.451
VOTERS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS NOT

02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:21.919
JUST REPUBLICANS FOR ALL VOTERS

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.887
IT'S THE WHIFF OF ANYTHING THAT

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:25.589
WOULD LOOK LIKE TAKING POWER

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:27.491
AWAY FROM THEM SO I WOULD JUST

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:29.994
CAUTION YOU TO YOU KNOW THE BIG

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.762
REFORMS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE

02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:33.731
GOING TO BE POPULAR SO. ONE

02:34:33.797 --> 02:34:35.065
THING TO THINK ABOUT YOU ASKED

02:34:35.132 --> 02:34:38.268
ME TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:39.803
BASICALLY HOW COULD WE CHANGE

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:43.173
THE- WELL LET'S BE BLUNT HOW

02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:44.341
CAN WE GET RID OF THE SO CALLED

02:34:44.408 --> 02:34:46.110
CLOWN CAR RATE HOW CAN WE MAKE

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:47.478
THAT AREN'T FORTY SIX

02:34:47.544 --> 02:34:49.647
CANDIDATES RUNNING AND THAT YOU

02:34:49.713 --> 02:34:53.651
KNOW THREE OF THEM ARE

02:34:53.717 --> 02:34:55.185
COMPETITIVE. AND THE- ANSWER IS.

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:56.720
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:58.122
CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS CODE AND

02:34:58.188 --> 02:35:00.524
REALIZE WHAT YOU ALL KNOW WHICH

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:01.892
IS THAT THE WAY WE DETERMINE

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:03.093
THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.695
RECALL CANDIDATES IS THE SAME

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:06.630
WAY WE DETERMINE QUALIFICATIONS

02:35:06.697 --> 02:35:08.432
FOR. CANDIDATES FOR THAT OFFICE

02:35:08.499 --> 02:35:10.300
IN A REGULAR ELECTION SO THE

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:11.769
THRESHOLD QUESTION THAT YOU

02:35:11.835 --> 02:35:12.670
HAVE TO ANSWER FOR YOURSELVES

02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:14.438
IS BASICALLY. DO YOU WANT TO

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:15.739
CHANGE THE LAW SO THAT'S NO

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.975
LONGER THE CASE. SO THAT THE

02:35:18.042 --> 02:35:18.876
WAY YOU DETERMINE THE

02:35:18.942 --> 02:35:20.310
QUALIFICATIONS TO BE GOVERNOR

02:35:20.377 --> 02:35:21.879
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY YOU

02:35:21.945 --> 02:35:23.480
DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO

02:35:23.547 --> 02:35:26.050
BE. A REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE IN

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:28.752
A GUBERNATORIAL RECALL- OR DO

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:29.720
YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE

02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:32.690
QUALIFICATIONS FOR. CANDIDATES

02:35:32.756 --> 02:35:34.625
PERIOD SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:37.261
THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND BE

02:35:37.327 --> 02:35:38.896
AWARE OUR FRIEND. SECOND THING

02:35:38.962 --> 02:35:41.065
IS OF COURSE THERE'S REALLY TWO

02:35:41.131 --> 02:35:42.633
LEVERS TO PULL HERE RIGHT

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:43.534
THERE'S THE FILING FEE

02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:45.369
WHATEVER. AND THEN THERE'S THE

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:47.304
SIGNATURE GATHERING LAST LEVER

02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:48.472
AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A LOT

02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:50.574
ABOUT THIS. TO SAY DOES IT MAKE

02:35:50.641 --> 02:35:52.943
SENSE TO MAKE IT HARDER. AND

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:54.578
THE ANSWER IS YES IT MAKES

02:35:54.645 --> 02:35:56.146
SENSE TO MAKE IT HARDER BECAUSE

02:35:56.213 --> 02:35:58.649
WE'VE JUST LIVED THROUGH. A

02:35:58.716 --> 02:36:01.452
RECALL ELECTION WHERE. I MEAN

02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:02.519
SHOW OF HANDS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:36:02.586 --> 02:36:04.254
WORK ON THE BALLOT AND BEING A

02:36:04.321 --> 02:36:05.689
LITTLE FACETIOUS HERE BUT-

02:36:05.756 --> 02:36:07.491
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON

02:36:07.558 --> 02:36:10.260
THE BALLOT IN. MOST OF THEM HAD

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:13.163
NO CHANCE OF BEING THE NEXT

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.765
GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:17.034
THEN. THE LAST AND WE CAN TALK

02:36:17.101 --> 02:36:18.368
MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD SAY

02:36:18.435 --> 02:36:22.506
SHOULD WE MAKE IT HARDER GAS.

02:36:22.573 --> 02:36:23.574
WHAT'S THE BEST NUMBER. YOU

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.610
KNOW IT. I DON'T AND I DON'T

02:36:26.677 --> 02:36:27.978
KNOW EXCEPT TO SAY THAT YOU

02:36:28.045 --> 02:36:29.313
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT

02:36:29.379 --> 02:36:31.081
SO THAT THERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE

02:36:31.148 --> 02:36:32.983
WHO CAN AFFORD THE FILING FEE-

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:35.252
YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT SO

02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:37.354
THAT YOU GET THE SIRIUS CANADA

02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:39.356
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS

02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:40.991
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

02:36:41.058 --> 02:36:43.127
RECALL CANDIDATES LET'S ALWAYS

02:36:43.193 --> 02:36:45.062
HAVE IN MIND THE VOTERS THE

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:46.630
VOTERS HAVE A SMALL PERIOD OF

02:36:46.697 --> 02:36:48.332
TIME TO TRY AND READ UP ON

02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:50.267
SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE THEIR

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:51.401
NEXT GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT

02:36:51.468 --> 02:36:53.871
GOVERNOR STATE LAWMAKER. AND SO

02:36:53.937 --> 02:36:55.839
IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THAT

02:36:55.906 --> 02:36:58.675
BUCKET OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR

02:36:58.742 --> 02:37:01.278
THE NEXT- QUALIFICATIONS FOR

02:37:01.345 --> 02:37:02.646
THE RECALL CANDIDATES THAT YOU

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:03.781
CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:37:03.847 --> 02:37:05.115
THE VOTERS OF MORE INFORMATION

02:37:05.182 --> 02:37:07.718
MAYBE IT YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO

02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:09.953
A BIPARTISAN QUESTIONNAIRE

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:11.455
MAYBE IT'S A ROOT MORE ROBUST

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:13.190
STATEMENT OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS

02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:14.358
I WOULD OFFER FOR YOU IT'S

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:16.293

RELEASE YOUR TAXES WE CAN FAX

02:37:18.629 --> 02:37:20.464
OBVIOUSLY BEEN AN ISSUE WE CAN

02:37:20.531 --> 02:37:21.565
LEAVE THAT TO THE SIDE FOR A

02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:22.933
SECOND BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.034
THINKING ABOUT ANY OF THESE

02:37:24.101 --> 02:37:25.369
REFORMS TO THE RECALL I WOULD

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:27.037
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE DOING

WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING.

02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:30.707
WHICH IS THINK ABOUT HOW TO

02:37:30.774 --> 02:37:32.509
SERVE THE VOTERS YOU DO NOT

02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:35.746

THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. AND WITH

02:37:48.926 --> 02:37:50.494

02:38:38.141 --> 02:38:39.810
DEMOCRACY AND HOW LIKE IT

WE- CALL MORE EVIDENCE OF THE

02:39:10.774 --> 02:39:14.544
WILL OF THE PEOPLE. SO THE

02:39:14.611 --> 02:39:16.446
THERE ARE MANY IDEAS THAT I

02:39:16.513 --> 02:39:18.482
DESERVE USE YOUR CENSORSHIP BUT

02:39:18.548 --> 02:39:20.384
TO MY MIND THE SINGLE BIGGEST

02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:21.785
AND MOST IN FACT IMPACTFUL

02:39:21.852 --> 02:39:24.221
CHANGE WOULD BE TO SEPARATE THE

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:26.423
PROCESS OF HOLDING A RECALL

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:28.091
ELECTION FROM THE PROCESS OF

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:31.361
SELECTING A REPLACEMENT CAN. BY

02:39:31.428 --> 02:39:32.696
KEEPING A SEPARATE WE CAN HAVE

02:39:32.763 --> 02:39:34.631
THE RECALL PROPERLY FOCUSED ON

02:39:34.698 --> 02:39:35.666
WHETHER THE OFFICE HOLDERS SUCH

02:39:35.732 --> 02:39:37.167
AS THE GOVERNOR IS TRULY FIT

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:38.769
FOR OFFICE AND THEN IF IT

02:39:38.835 --> 02:39:41.471
SUCCEEDS YOU COULD HAVE STRONG

02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:43.640
CANDIDATES FROM BOTH PARTIES

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:45.375
FREE TO ENTER THE REPLACEMENT

02:39:45.442 --> 02:39:47.344
CONTEST AND THEY WOULD COMPETE

02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:49.746
FOR THE VOTES OF A LARGE AND

02:39:49.813 --> 02:39:51.682
REPRESENTATIVE ELECTRIC. BY

02:39:51.748 --> 02:39:53.050
CONTRAST DOING THINGS THE WAY

02:39:53.116 --> 02:39:54.952
WE DO NOW IN CALIFORNIA FUSING

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:56.586
THESE INTO A SINGLE BALLOT

02:39:56.653 --> 02:39:57.587
SOMETHING THEY WERE AN OUT LIAR

02:39:57.654 --> 02:39:59.456
ON THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER STATE

02:39:59.523 --> 02:40:01.558
DOES THAT IT POSES TWO

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:03.860
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES FOR

02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:04.528
DEMOCRACY IN THE RECALL

02:40:04.594 --> 02:40:07.197
PROCESS. THE FIRST IS IT

02:40:07.264 --> 02:40:09.333
CREATES AN IRRESISTIBLE

02:40:09.399 --> 02:40:11.101
INVITATION FOR THE INCUMBENT

02:40:11.168 --> 02:40:12.769
PARTY TO MANIPULATE THE

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:14.905
ELECTION BY CLEARING THE FIELD

02:40:14.972 --> 02:40:16.873
OF CANDIDATES IN AND ALSO BY

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:19.476
CLEARING THE FIELD OF VOTERS SO

02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:21.278
THIS IS BECAUSE THESE TWO

02:40:21.345 --> 02:40:23.780
QUESTIONS REFUSE. ANY CANDIDATE

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:25.682
FACING THE THREAT OF A RECALL

02:40:25.749 --> 02:40:28.085
KNOWS THAT THE KIDS AVAILABLE

02:40:28.151 --> 02:40:29.486
REPLACEMENT CONTEST WILL HAVE A

02:40:29.553 --> 02:40:31.688
HUGE EFFECT ON WEATHER HERE SHE

02:40:31.755 --> 02:40:34.191
SURVIVES THE RECALL OR NOT. SO

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:35.092
WHAT DOES THAT EXPIRE

02:40:35.158 --> 02:40:36.660
POLITICIAN DO WHAT THEY DO WHAT

02:40:36.727 --> 02:40:39.363
WE SAW IN THIS RECALL WHICH BY

02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:40.397
THE WAY BECAUSE IT WAS SO

02:40:40.464 --> 02:40:42.032
SUCCESSFUL THIS WILL BE THE

02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:44.101
PLAYBOOK FOR THE NEXT RECALLS

02:40:44.167 --> 02:40:45.502
THAT WE SEEN CALIFORNIA WHETHER

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:47.571
THEY'RE ANOTHER EIGHTEEN THIRTY

02:40:47.637 --> 02:40:49.106
SIX OR SEVENTY TWO YEARS AWAY.

02:40:49.172 --> 02:40:56.646
RIGHT. WHAT DID WHAT DOES IT.

02:40:56.713 --> 02:40:59.649
WE CALL THE FISH OKAY WORK. THE

02:40:59.716 --> 02:41:01.852
FIELD TO ENSURE THE PERTAINING

02:41:01.918 --> 02:41:04.654
PRECOCIAL AND- AND SCRIPTER AND

02:41:04.721 --> 02:41:08.125
REPLACING THEM WITH A- WITH A

02:41:08.191 --> 02:41:11.328
MEMBER OF THE OTHER PARTY RIGHT

02:41:11.395 --> 02:41:13.330
SO VOTERS FACED THIS DIFFICULT

02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:16.900
CHOICE AND- AND THAT HELPS THE

02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:18.835
RECALLED OFFICIAL THIS WAS

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:20.337
SUCCESSFUL STUNNINGLY

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:21.905
SUCCESSFUL THIS YEAR IN THE

02:41:21.972 --> 02:41:23.473
RECALL CONTEST IT WILL BE

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.442
EMULATED IN FUTURE ELECTIONS IT

02:41:25.509 --> 02:41:27.277
HELPED THE PARTY OF THE

02:41:27.344 --> 02:41:29.446
GOVERNOR WIN. BUT VOTERS LOST

02:41:29.513 --> 02:41:30.580
RIGHT THIS WASN'T A DECISION

02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:32.315
VOTERS MADE THEY DIDN'T NARROW

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:33.550
THE FIELD AND THE FIELD WAS

02:41:33.617 --> 02:41:35.986
NARROWED FOR THEM- IT WAS

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:37.788
SOMETHING WHERE IT WAS HELPFUL

02:41:37.854 --> 02:41:39.122
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:40.891
BUT DEEPLY UNHEALTHY THE

02:41:40.957 --> 02:41:43.126
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS NOT TAPPED

02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:45.228
STRONG CANDIDATES ON EACH SIDE.

02:41:45.295 --> 02:41:47.030
THE SECOND THING THAT WAS A BIG

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:48.665
REPRESENTATION A PROBLEM WITH

02:41:48.732 --> 02:41:50.667
THIS RECALL WAS THAT AS PART OF

02:41:50.734 --> 02:41:52.869
THIS STRATEGY OF HELPING TO

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:54.871
PROTECT THE INCOMING ON THE

02:41:54.938 --> 02:41:57.140
FIRST QUESTION. THE INCUMBENT

02:41:57.207 --> 02:41:59.676
AND HIS PARTY URGED VOTERS TO

02:41:59.743 --> 02:42:01.545
STAY OUT OF THE SECOND QUESTION

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:02.546
THIS LED TO SOMETHING I'VE

02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:03.914
NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA

02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:05.715
WE HAD FIVE MILLION PEOPLE

02:42:05.782 --> 02:42:07.484
PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECTION

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:08.819
AND TAYING FOR HALF OF THAT

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:10.787
NOT HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN

02:42:10.854 --> 02:42:12.622
THIS THIS WAS BOTH A MUCH

02:42:12.689 --> 02:42:15.192
SMALLER ELECTRIC. BUT ALSO A

02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:17.694
LESS REPRESENTATIVE ELECTED TO

02:42:17.761 --> 02:42:19.529
THE UC SAN DIEGO YANKELOVICH

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:21.631
SURVEY CANTAT LOOKED AT THE

02:42:21.698 --> 02:42:24.067
DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE WHO WERE

02:42:24.134 --> 02:42:25.769
PARTICIPATING IN THE TWENTY

02:42:25.836 --> 02:42:27.537
TWENTY ELECTION THE TWENTY AT

02:42:27.604 --> 02:42:28.672
THE RECALL ELECTION IN THE

02:42:28.738 --> 02:42:30.474
REPLACEMENT CONTEST WE FOUND

02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:32.442
TRACKING OUR SAMPLE THOSE WHO

02:42:32.509 --> 02:42:34.177
PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE VERY

02:42:34.244 --> 02:42:35.645
FEW PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN

02:42:35.712 --> 02:42:37.981
THE RECOLOR PLACEMENT CONTEST-

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:40.183
WHO WERE MORE LIKELY TO. TO BE

02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:41.852
RICHER BUT MORE AFFLUENT VOTERS

02:42:41.918 --> 02:42:44.087
IN FAR FEWER VOTERS MAKING

02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:45.055
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS

02:42:45.122 --> 02:42:46.690
MORE LIKELY BE WHITE VOTERS FAR

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:49.659
FEWER BLACK AND AAPI VOTERS AND

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:50.861
ALSO THAT THIS WAS NOT

02:42:50.927 --> 02:42:53.363
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE IDEOLOGY

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:54.965
OF CALIFORNIA SELECTED SO.

02:42:55.031 --> 02:42:56.233
REACHED TWO PROBLEMS RIGHT

02:42:56.299 --> 02:42:57.634
HAVING FEWER CANDIDATES AND

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:59.169
FEWER VOTERS IN THE POOL WE'RE

02:42:59.236 --> 02:43:02.038
ALL A FUNCTION OF A POLITICAL

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:05.142
REACTION TO DEFUSE THE BALLOT.

02:43:05.208 --> 02:43:06.309
TO HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT YOU

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:10.714
SEPARATE THE TWO BALLOTS. YOU

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:11.548
HAVE RECALL CONTEST AND THEN IF

02:43:11.615 --> 02:43:13.049
ONLY IF IT IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL.

02:43:13.116 --> 02:43:15.118
A MONTH OR TWO LATER YOU

02:43:15.185 --> 02:43:16.319
REPLACED YOU HAVE A REPLACEMENT

02:43:16.386 --> 02:43:18.321
RACE. BOB THIS IS SOME OF THE

02:43:18.388 --> 02:43:19.089
VOTERS SUPPORTED THAT

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:23.660
YANKELOVICH SURVEY BY. 4937%

02:43:23.727 --> 02:43:25.996
MARK DEFENDERS WERE SUPPORT.

02:43:26.062 --> 02:43:27.430
PROPOSAL I DO SOMETHING THAT

02:43:27.497 --> 02:43:28.565
DOES HAVE ONE POLITICAL

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:30.500
DRAWBACK RIGHT TO POTENTIAL

02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:32.836
COST OF THIS YOU WOULD HAVE TO

02:43:32.903 --> 02:43:35.238
RUN. A STACK ALEXION. FIRST

02:43:35.305 --> 02:43:36.873
THAT COST WOULD ONLY BE BORN IF

02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:38.141
THE RECALL IS SUCCESSFUL RIGHT

02:43:38.208 --> 02:43:39.876
REALITIES OF THE DEAD DID IN

02:43:39.943 --> 02:43:40.477
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S NO

02:43:40.544 --> 02:43:41.478
REPLACEMENT CONTEST NO

02:43:41.545 --> 02:43:43.880
ADDITIONAL STATE COSTS MUCH OF

02:43:43.947 --> 02:43:45.515
THE CRITICISM. OF THE COST OF

02:43:45.582 --> 02:43:47.184
RECALL IS THAT IT WAS COST IT

02:43:47.250 --> 02:43:48.718
WAS ACOSTA BURKE FOR AN

02:43:48.785 --> 02:43:49.819
ELECTION IT DIDN'T HAVE POPULAR

02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:51.421
SUPPORT THIS WOULD ONLY TRIGGER

02:43:51.488 --> 02:43:53.089
THAT THAT COST IF THERE IS

02:43:53.156 --> 02:43:55.225
POPULAR SUPPORT. IN SECOND

02:43:55.292 --> 02:43:56.626
ANOTHER WAY TO ADDRESS THE COST

02:43:56.693 --> 02:43:58.562
ARGUMENT BEING ALTERNATIVE

02:43:58.628 --> 02:43:59.162
VERSION OF THIS WHICH IS THE

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:01.865
HOLDER BECAUSE- A CONTEST ON

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:04.701
YEAH. SO ELEMENT CANADA. AND IF

02:44:04.768 --> 02:44:06.436
IT IS SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE A

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:08.038
REPLACE CONTEST INITIALLY

02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:09.239
SCHEDULED STATEWIDE ELECTION

02:44:09.306 --> 02:44:11.208

THANKS VERY MUCH AFTER

02:44:14.678 --> 02:44:16.379
CONSIDERING THAT IDEA WHICH I

02:44:16.446 --> 02:44:18.415
THINK IS THE ONE THAT WOULD

02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:20.016
RESTORE THE MOST OUT THE

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.885
FULLEST VOICE OF THE ELECTRIC.

ASPECT OF IT BUT PT IT IN THE

02:45:07.797 --> 02:45:09.699
CONTEXT OF A LARGER THEME WHICH

02:45:09.766 --> 02:45:11.568
IS THAT THE RECALL THE WAITERS

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:13.703
CURRENTLY DESIGNED MAKES A

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:17.073
MOCKERY OF MAJORITY RULE- NARAL

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:19.309
WILL BE SOLVED IT'S TEMPTING TO

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:20.477
ONLY THINK ABOUT THE MOST

02:45:20.543 --> 02:45:21.544
RECENT EXPERIENCE OF THE

02:45:21.611 --> 02:45:24.147
GUBERNATORIAL RECALL AND TO NOT

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:27.017
SEE HOW- MAJORITY RULE IS

02:45:27.083 --> 02:45:28.318
THREATENED IN A MORE GENERAL

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:30.887
WAY. SO I JUST SAID I MIX SOME

02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:33.323
A FEW KEY POINTS AND TO TALK

02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:36.259
ABOUT WHY THE SOLUTION I WAS

02:45:36.326 --> 02:45:37.961
HAVING A SINGLE BALLOT WHERE

02:45:38.028 --> 02:45:38.928
THE GOVERNOR CHEERS AMONG

02:45:38.995 --> 02:45:41.364
ALTERNATES AND TO HAVE A SYSTEM

02:45:41.431 --> 02:45:43.400
LIKE AN INSTANT RUNOFF OR

02:45:43.466 --> 02:45:47.737
SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE. CAN

02:45:47.804 --> 02:45:48.772
HELP PRESERVE MAJORITY WILL- SO

02:45:48.838 --> 02:45:50.307
JUST KEY POINTS IS THAT THE

02:45:50.373 --> 02:45:52.175
CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IT

02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:53.310
WAS DESIGNED OVER A HUNDRED

02:45:53.376 --> 02:45:55.879
YEARS AGO. AND WHILE IT HAS

02:45:55.945 --> 02:45:58.014
BEEN RARELY USED- AS WE SEE

02:45:58.081 --> 02:46:00.016
SIGNS THAT IT MAY BE USED MORE

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:02.185
FREQUENTLY MOVING FORWARD. I

02:46:02.252 --> 02:46:03.420
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:04.988
ENVIRONMENT OF DEEP PARTY

02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:07.324
POLARIZATION AS WELL AS SOCIAL

02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:09.693
MEDIA ECHO CHAMBERS OF RAMPANT

02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:11.695
MISINFORMATION. SECOND MAJOR

02:46:11.761 --> 02:46:13.496
POINT IS THAT FUTURE RECALL

02:46:13.563 --> 02:46:15.031
ELECTIONS PARTICULARLY IN STATE

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:16.866
LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS COULD

02:46:16.933 --> 02:46:17.967
HAVE SIGNIFICANT EQUITY

02:46:18.034 --> 02:46:20.170
CONCERNS AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:20.770
AND LOW INCOME VOTERS YOUNGER

02:46:20.837 --> 02:46:22.605
VOTERS. WE DO HAVE AN

02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:24.040
OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE AND

02:46:24.107 --> 02:46:25.508
I'LL TALK ABOUT A FEW WAYS IN

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:27.310
WHICH WE CAN DO THAT. TWO WEEKS

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:28.845
BLAME CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP

02:46:28.912 --> 02:46:30.547
WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION AND

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:34.217
GOVERNANCE OUR NATION. MY

02:46:34.284 --> 02:46:35.585
APOLOGIES FOR ANY NOISE YOU

02:46:35.652 --> 02:46:36.986
MIGHT HEAR IN THE BACK MY KIDS

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:37.554
ARE COMING BACK WITH SCHOOL

02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:42.359
RECORD. NO WORRIES SO- FIRST

02:46:42.425 --> 02:46:43.193
WHEN IT COMES TO SIGNATURE

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:45.495
GATHERING WE SHOULD IF WE

02:46:45.562 --> 02:46:46.863
CONSIDER IF WE ARE CONCERNED

02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:47.964
ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR

02:46:48.031 --> 02:46:49.499
DEMOCRACY IT IS NOT THE NUMBER

02:46:49.566 --> 02:46:50.533
OF SIGNATURES WE NEED TO PAY

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:52.802
ATTENTION TO BUT THE PROPORTION

02:46:52.869 --> 02:46:53.470
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALKED

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:55.472
ABOUT IN THE PAST IT BIT BY

02:46:55.538 --> 02:46:57.173
PREVIOUS SPEAKER. WHEN YOU HAVE

02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.576
A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE 12%

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:01.644
OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS THAT CAN

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:03.246
ESSENTIALLY FORCE AN ELECTION

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:06.049
ON THE REST OF CALIFORNIA- THAT

02:47:06.116 --> 02:47:08.017
THREATENS THE WILL OF THE

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:09.185
MAJORITY AND ITS ABILITY TO

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:10.887
GOVERN BASED ON THE KIND OF

02:47:10.954 --> 02:47:13.423
MANDATE THAT IT PUT IN PLACE IN

02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:15.859
THE PART OF MUCH. WHAT ALSO

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:17.293
MAKES A MOCKERY OF MAJORITY

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.795
RULE IS OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:20.463
WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN

02:47:20.530 --> 02:47:24.501
INCUMBENT. WITH 452409% IN FACT

02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:27.003
JUST ONE VOTE SHY FIFTY

02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:29.272
PERCENT. TO LOSE. AND TO BE

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:31.307
REPLACED BY SOMEONE WITH

02:47:31.374 --> 02:47:33.843
SUPPORT BELOW 30% THEY'RE ALSO

02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:35.912
EQUITY CONCERNS ABOUT IT WE

02:47:35.979 --> 02:47:37.914
DIDN'T WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF A

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:39.749
DROP OFF IN THE GUBERNATORIAL

02:47:39.816 --> 02:47:41.651
RECALL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:42.218
WE HAVE TWELVE POINT FIVE

02:47:42.285 --> 02:47:44.120
MILLION VOTERS. TWENTY TWENTY

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:45.455
ONE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION.

02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:47.590
BUT IN THE CASE OF THE RECALL

02:47:47.657 --> 02:47:49.559
OF SENATOR NEWMAN. YOU HAD AN

02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:51.828
ELECTRIC OF THREE HUNDRED

02:47:51.895 --> 02:47:53.229
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND VOTES IN TWO

02:47:53.296 --> 02:47:53.863
THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND LESS THAN

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:55.899
HALF OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY

02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.700
EIGHT THOUSAND VOTES. IN TWENTY

02:47:57.767 --> 02:47:58.334
EIGHTEEN SO WE SHOULD BE VERY

02:47:58.401 --> 02:47:59.469
MINDFUL WHEN YOU HAVE LOW

02:47:59.536 --> 02:48:01.304
TURNOUT ELECTIONS. VOTERS OF

02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:02.972
COLOR YOUNG VOTERS LOW INCOME

02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:06.009
VOTERS TEND TO VOTE AT A

02:48:06.075 --> 02:48:08.178
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOWER RATE.

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.345
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS ALSO

02:48:09.412 --> 02:48:10.780
ARCHAIC IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:12.482
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INCORPORATE

02:48:12.549 --> 02:48:14.350
OUR TOP TWO PROCESS WHICH ARE

02:48:14.417 --> 02:48:17.854
CALIFORNIANS HAVE. HAVE ENJOYED

02:48:17.921 --> 02:48:19.289
OVER THE PAST DECADE AND THAT

02:48:19.355 --> 02:48:21.024
ITSELF WAS AN INNOVATION THAT

02:48:21.090 --> 02:48:22.025
WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE

02:48:22.091 --> 02:48:24.227
BALLOT NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE

02:48:24.294 --> 02:48:26.196
INSTANT RUNOFF. ALL RIGHT SO

02:48:26.262 --> 02:48:27.630
YOU EITHER HAVE THE IF YOU WANT

02:48:27.697 --> 02:48:29.132
AN INSURER MAJORITY WILL YOU

02:48:29.199 --> 02:48:30.266
EITHER HAVE A TWO STAGE

02:48:30.333 --> 02:48:31.601
ELECTION MARK PROFESSOR

02:48:31.668 --> 02:48:33.636
GALLAGHER IS TALKING ABOUT-

02:48:33.703 --> 02:48:35.438
BOARDING INSTANT RUN OFF OF ITS

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:37.240
A SINGLE ELECTION SO THAT YOU

02:48:37.307 --> 02:48:38.541
GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:40.076
MAJORITY ISN'T THERE IS A KIND

02:48:40.143 --> 02:48:42.579
OF MAJORITY. MANDATE THAT THE

02:48:42.645 --> 02:48:44.080
INCUMBENT HAD ENJOYED IN THE

02:48:44.147 --> 02:48:46.349
PRIOR ELECTION THE CARD SYSTEM

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:49.452
AS IT'S DESIGNED DOES NOT DO

02:48:49.519 --> 02:48:50.119
THAT AND IT NEEDS TO BE REVISED.

02:48:50.186 --> 02:48:52.288
FINALLY IN THE END MY TO I

02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:53.556
WOULD SAY PERHAPS MY MOST

02:48:53.623 --> 02:48:55.492
IMPORTANT POINTS. AND ADVICE TO

02:48:55.558 --> 02:48:56.693
THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS

02:48:56.759 --> 02:48:58.862
SOMETHING I TESTIFIED THE

02:48:58.928 --> 02:48:59.395
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:02.632
EARLIER TODAY. IS THAT. THE

02:49:02.699 --> 02:49:04.501
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER IF

02:49:04.567 --> 02:49:06.002
IT DOES PUT SOMETHING BEFORE

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:08.338
THE VOTERS NOT TO PACKAGE

02:49:08.404 --> 02:49:12.108
EVERYTHING INTO ONE MEASURE AND

02:49:12.175 --> 02:49:13.576
TO GUESS WHAT THE VOTERS WILL

02:49:13.643 --> 02:49:15.645
SUPPORT SEVERAL MONTHS DOWN THE

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:22.051
LINE. DARLIN MEASURES AND TO

02:49:22.118 --> 02:49:23.520
GIVE VOTERS THE ABILITY TO

02:49:23.586 --> 02:49:24.587
CHOOSE THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:49:24.654 --> 02:49:26.122
ADVANTAGES FIRST OF ALL THERE

02:49:26.189 --> 02:49:27.123
IS UNCERTAINTY IN PUBLIC

02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:29.225

TOWARDS ELECTION DAY. VOTERS

02:49:33.296 --> 02:49:36.165
HATE ONE. ASIAN OR THERE'S A

02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.867
MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON ONE

02:49:37.934 --> 02:49:41.738
PARTICULAR PIECE OF THAT REFORM

02:49:41.804 --> 02:49:42.272
U. REST SINKING THE ENTIRE

02:49:42.338 --> 02:49:44.641
EFFORT. SPLITTING IT UP ALSO

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:46.643
GIVES VOTERS MORE OPPORTUNITIES

02:49:46.709 --> 02:49:48.845
TO DELIBERATE AND DECIDE WHICH

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:49.879
ASPECTS SEEM TO MAKE THE MOST

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:51.314
SENSE SALES SIGNATURE

02:49:51.381 --> 02:49:53.550
REQUIREMENTS OR WHETHER IT

02:49:53.616 --> 02:49:55.451
SHOULD BE ONE- BALLOT OR TO

REFORMS PASSED IF INDEED THERE

IS. AN APPETITE FOR REFORM IN

02:50:09.232 --> 02:50:11.968
CALIFORNIA. WE WILL LIKELY SEE

SEVERAL OF THOSE PROVISIONS

02:50:13.069 --> 02:50:15.972
PASS AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO

02:50:16.039 --> 02:50:18.608

WITHIN A PACKAGE- THAT VOTERS.

02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:24.080
OPPOSE AN END UP SINKING THE

02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:25.014
WHOLE MEASURE. FINALLY WE CAN

02:50:25.081 --> 02:50:26.549
ALSO INUNDATED BY CONSIDERING

02:50:26.616 --> 02:50:28.885

SOMETHING NEW AND YET THEY'RE

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:50.873
NOT GOING TO BURDEN ALL FUTURE

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:52.475
GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:53.977

BADLY DESIGNED OR UNINTENDED

SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE THE

02:51:05.221 --> 02:51:07.190
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER NOT

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:08.891
IN THE SPIRIT OF INNOVATION TO

02:51:08.958 --> 02:51:11.361
NOT EXPERIMENT IN A WAY- THAT

02:51:11.427 --> 02:51:13.162
SADDLES FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:14.964

OFF HER OFFICE. MY REFORM WOULD

02:54:04.901 --> 02:54:06.202

HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL RECALL

02:54:08.738 --> 02:54:10.706
WHEN THE GOVERNOR IS CORRUPT

02:54:10.773 --> 02:54:13.142
SENILE OR INCOMPETENT BECAUSE

02:54:13.209 --> 02:54:14.610

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:56.385
BEEN A MEMBER OF THE OTHER

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:59.188

02:58:51.887 --> 02:58:53.289
HESITATE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO

02:58:53.355 --> 02:58:55.091
HAVE QUALIFICATIONS FOR ONE.

02:58:55.157 --> 02:58:56.725
AND NOT QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE

02:58:56.792 --> 02:58:59.161
OTHER IF LIKE YOU HAD SAID IT

02:58:59.228 --> 02:59:00.996
WOULD HAVE TO BE FOR EVERYBODY.

02:59:01.063 --> 02:59:02.865
AND AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:59:02.932 --> 02:59:06.769
THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL. THING-

02:59:06.836 --> 02:59:08.204
THE MAJORITY RULE VERSUS

02:59:08.270 --> 02:59:10.506
SUPERMAJORITY RULES ANOTHER

02:59:10.573 --> 02:59:13.242
DOCTOR COMIC CHRIS DEMAND.

02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:15.611
THING I'M A CHRISTIAN THANK YOU.

02:59:15.678 --> 02:59:16.979
SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A

02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:18.347
DIFFERENCE IN GOVERNANCE WHEN

02:59:18.414 --> 02:59:20.149
YOU HAVE YEAH AND I YOU KNOW

02:59:20.216 --> 02:59:21.584
WHAT IN THE INTEREST OF BLOOD

02:59:21.650 --> 02:59:23.319
ESSENCE EVERYBODY'S BEING BLACK

02:59:23.385 --> 02:59:24.854
ALL RIGHT I'M NOT ONE OF

02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:26.422
NINETEEN REPUBLICANS IN THE

02:59:26.489 --> 02:59:28.858
ASSEMBLY AND- IN THE SENATE I

02:59:28.924 --> 02:59:31.093
BELIEVE. MISTAKE CENTER TO

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:33.229
NIELSEN IS ONE OF NINE SENATORS

02:59:33.295 --> 02:59:35.264
BOTH OF THOSE ARE 75%

02:59:35.331 --> 02:59:37.666
SUPERMAJORITY- WHEN YOU'RE

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:40.069
LOOKING AT. WHETHER THAT'S AN

02:59:40.136 --> 02:59:42.938
EFFECTIVE. CHECKS AND BALANCES

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:44.206
WHEN THE GOVERNOR IS SUPER

02:59:44.273 --> 02:59:45.541
ALIGNED WITH THE SUPER

02:59:45.608 --> 02:59:50.646
MAJORITIES. AND THEN THE.

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:52.581
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS MOST

02:59:52.648 --> 02:59:54.483
MORE THAN LIKELY THIS THE SAME

02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:56.085
DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT PLAY

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:58.287
INTO WHY PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR

02:59:58.354 --> 03:00:01.557
A CHANGE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES

03:00:01.624 --> 03:00:04.260
SUPERMAJORITIES THAT I'VE FOUND

03:00:04.326 --> 03:00:06.729
DON'T GOVERN THE SAME WAY AS A

03:00:06.795 --> 03:00:08.764
SIMPLE MAJORITY AND I LOOK TO

03:00:08.831 --> 03:00:10.466
OUR PURPLE DISTRICTS IN THE

03:00:10.533 --> 03:00:13.035
STATE AND WHAT THOSE CANDIDATES

03:00:13.102 --> 03:00:14.170
GO THROUGH DURING THEIR

03:00:14.236 --> 03:00:16.405
ELECTION PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO

03:00:16.472 --> 03:00:20.176
NON PURPLE DISTRICTS. AND IT

03:00:20.242 --> 03:00:23.312
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. DAY IN

03:00:23.379 --> 03:00:23.913
THE PURPLE DISTRICTS ACTUALLY

03:00:23.979 --> 03:00:27.516
HAVE TO. ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:29.218
THAT DON'T NECESSARILY ALIGN

03:00:29.285 --> 03:00:31.287
WITH ALL OF THEIR- THERE ARE

03:00:31.353 --> 03:00:33.389
BELIEVED THEY CAN'T JUST

03:00:33.455 --> 03:00:35.724
DISREGARD THEM. IN A

03:00:35.791 --> 03:00:37.226
SUPERMAJORITY CASE A LOT OF

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:39.595
TIMES LOT OF THE ELECTORATE IS

03:00:39.662 --> 03:00:41.964
JUST SIMPLY DISREGARDED. AND

03:00:42.031 --> 03:00:43.632
WHEN YOU DISREGARD THEM YEAH

03:00:43.699 --> 03:00:45.234
THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNHAPPY AND

03:00:45.301 --> 03:00:47.169
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO EXPRESS

03:00:47.236 --> 03:00:48.737
THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE

03:00:48.804 --> 03:00:50.673
TOLD THINGS DURING AN ELECTION.

03:00:50.739 --> 03:00:52.274
AND THEN AFTER THE ELECTION

03:00:52.341 --> 03:00:53.709
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:55.277
WITH THE CANDIDATE THEY SAID

03:00:55.344 --> 03:00:56.745
HEY YOU KNOW YOU TOLD US YOU

03:00:56.812 --> 03:00:57.613
WERE GOING TO OVERTURN THE

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:00.149
DEATH PENALTY AND THEN DESPITE

03:01:00.216 --> 03:01:01.984
TWO INITIATIVES THAT SAID.

03:01:02.051 --> 03:01:05.020
WE'RE GOOD WE ARE WE AS A STATE

03:01:05.087 --> 03:01:06.822
ARE GOOD WITH THE DEATH PENALTY.

03:01:06.889 --> 03:01:08.123
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIRST THANK

03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:09.792
YOU DO IS GET EXECUTIVE POWER

03:01:09.858 --> 03:01:11.560
TO OVERTURN THEDEATH PENALTY.

03:01:11.627 --> 03:01:13.362
SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:15.798
SITUATION. THE ONLY THING LEFT

03:01:15.864 --> 03:01:19.101
IS THIS. IS OUR OUR CITIZENS

03:01:19.168 --> 03:01:21.103
ABILITY TO DO A RECALL. AND

03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:23.038
THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU KNOW

03:01:23.105 --> 03:01:24.139
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE AND

03:01:24.206 --> 03:01:25.341
MAJORITY RULE VERSUS

03:01:25.407 --> 03:01:28.711
SUPERMAJORITY RULE. AND SORRY

03:01:28.777 --> 03:01:29.311
MY QUESTION TO THAT THE DOCTOR

03:01:29.378 --> 03:01:32.381
WAS. DO YOU SEE THAT OR DO YOU

03:01:32.448 --> 03:01:36.085
FEEL LIKE THAT'S INVALID. THANK

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:40.456
YOU- YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO.

03:01:40.522 --> 03:01:42.992
AB DE VOTERS HAVING A CHOICE

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:44.393
FOR PUNISHING ELECTED OFFICIALS

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:45.594
THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY WHAT

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:47.596
REELECTIONS ARE FOR- IN THE

03:01:47.663 --> 03:01:48.998
CASE OF THE ASSEMBLY EVERY TWO

03:01:49.064 --> 03:01:51.500
YEARS IN THE SENATE EVERY EVERY

03:01:51.567 --> 03:01:55.604
FOUR YEARS- IT IS. IN A

03:01:55.671 --> 03:01:58.474
MAJORITIES DO HAVE. NOT ONLY

03:01:58.540 --> 03:01:59.608
THE RIGHT BUT THE OBLIGATION TO

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:03.979
GOVERN- AND I DON'T THINK

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:05.681
ANYONE INTENDED THE RECALL

03:02:05.748 --> 03:02:08.917
PROVISION TO BE A SUBSTITUTE

03:02:08.984 --> 03:02:11.020
FOR OR WHATEVER- VOTING RULES

03:02:11.086 --> 03:02:12.254
WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S

03:02:12.321 --> 03:02:14.089
NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE RECALL

03:02:14.156 --> 03:02:17.793
IS THEREFORE- AND IF CALIFORNIA

03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:20.195
VOTERS WANTED TO. CREATE SOME

03:02:20.262 --> 03:02:22.398
OTHER MECHANISM TO ENSURE- THAT

03:02:22.464 --> 03:02:23.365
MINORITY INTERESTS ARE

03:02:23.432 --> 03:02:25.134
REPRESENTED- THERE ARE OTHER

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:27.336
WAYS. OF DOING IT GIVING I

03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:31.206
WOULD SAY IS AS YOU THINK ABOUT

03:02:31.273 --> 03:02:34.410
THE KIND OF REFORMS TO BE MADE.

03:02:34.476 --> 03:02:36.078
TO REALLY TAKE THE LONG VIEW

03:02:36.145 --> 03:02:38.180
RIGHT- SO ARE RECALL SYSTEM WAS

03:02:38.247 --> 03:02:40.049
DESIGNED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN

03:02:40.115 --> 03:02:41.517
IT'S STILL IN PLACE AND THERE'S

03:02:41.583 --> 03:02:43.552
ANXIETY THAT IS BEING USED FOR

03:02:43.619 --> 03:02:45.187
DIFFERENT KINDS OF PURPOSES

03:02:45.254 --> 03:02:46.455
THAT. WILL REGIONALLY INVISION

03:02:46.522 --> 03:02:49.124
AND WHATEVER REFORMS WE DO

03:02:49.191 --> 03:02:51.260
SHOULD NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:52.761
THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNOR OF

03:02:52.828 --> 03:02:55.698
THE PARTY THE LIEUTENANT

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:56.231
GOVERNOR THE PARTY IF THE

03:02:56.298 --> 03:02:57.399
LEGISLATURE. WITH RESPECT TO

03:02:57.466 --> 03:02:59.601
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-

03:02:59.668 --> 03:03:01.670
AUTOMATICALLY GOING INTO A

03:03:01.737 --> 03:03:04.540
PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY. FILLING

03:03:04.606 --> 03:03:05.274
A VACANCY ON THE GOVERNOR'S

03:03:05.341 --> 03:03:08.377
RECALLED. I WOULD URGE CAUTION.

03:03:08.444 --> 03:03:10.612
AGAIN RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:12.514
FROM THE SAME PARTY. IMAGINE A

03:03:12.581 --> 03:03:14.149
SCENARIO MABILLE FACTIONS

03:03:14.216 --> 03:03:15.884
WITHIN PARTIES WE HAVE A

03:03:15.951 --> 03:03:17.152
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THATCOMES

03:03:17.219 --> 03:03:19.421
FROM THE PARTICULARLY VOCAL

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:21.256
FACTION WITHIN THE SAME PARTY.

03:03:21.323 --> 03:03:22.891
AND IS ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HANDS

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:24.259
CLEAN AND LET OTHER PEOPLE DO

03:03:24.326 --> 03:03:26.995
THE DIRTY WORK OF JUST GETTING

03:03:27.062 --> 03:03:28.897
12% OF SIGNATURE TO THE

03:03:28.964 --> 03:03:31.100
ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND TO HAVE

03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:32.935
A VERY PASSIONATE MINORITY NOT

03:03:33.001 --> 03:03:36.505
A MINORITY PARTY. BUT APASSIONATE MINORITY WITHIN A

03:03:36.572 --> 03:03:38.841
MAJORITY PARTY. TO GET THAT

03:03:38.907 --> 03:03:39.641
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GOVERNOR

03:03:39.708 --> 03:03:42.277
INSTALLED. SO THAT IS SOMETHING

03:03:42.344 --> 03:03:45.080
THAT I. WE HAVE TO BE THINKING

03:03:45.147 --> 03:03:47.049
NOT ONLY ABOUT OUR CURRENT

03:03:47.116 --> 03:03:49.852
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE BUT THE

03:03:49.918 --> 03:03:50.486
LANDSCAPE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE

03:03:50.552 --> 03:03:51.687
A SUNSET PROVISION AND IF YOU

03:03:51.754 --> 03:03:52.955

FOR THE NEXT DECADE. WE'RE

03:03:58.026 --> 03:03:59.261
GONNA BE DOING SOMETHING THAT

03:03:59.328 --> 03:04:00.362
CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE TO LIVE

03:04:00.429 --> 03:04:01.897
WITH FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS

SEVENTY YEARS HUNDRED YEARS- WE

03:04:04.433 --> 03:04:06.301
NEED TO THINK ABOUT REFORMS

03:04:06.368 --> 03:04:07.369
THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF

03:04:07.436 --> 03:04:10.072
TIME AND NOT BASED ON. WHAT THE

03:04:10.139 --> 03:04:11.507
WHAT THE PARTIES LOOK LIKE OR

03:04:11.573 --> 03:04:14.643
EVEN WHAT OUR CURRENT ASSET OF

03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:17.513
ELECTED OFFICIALS LOOK LIKE.

03:04:17.579 --> 03:04:18.347
THANK YOU I WISH WE COULD DO

ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT. IF YOU

03:05:22.978 --> 03:05:24.480
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN IN

03:05:24.546 --> 03:05:25.714
IN IN PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS

PRESIDENT I'D STATES LOOK AT

03:05:27.449 --> 03:05:29.051
THE EARLY. HISTORY OF CAL OF

03:05:29.117 --> 03:05:30.486
UNITED STATES. WHERE THE VICE

03:05:30.552 --> 03:05:31.954
FOR THE SECOND RUNNER UP BECAME

03:05:32.020 --> 03:05:33.822

DON'T KNOW. B. SO INSIDIOUS

03:05:37.593 --> 03:05:39.628
THAT THEIR MOTIVATION WOULD BE

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:41.263
TO TAKE OUT THE GOVERNOR. BUT

03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:42.965
I'M I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO THINKS

03:05:43.031 --> 03:05:43.732
THAT THE IDEA THAT THE

03:05:43.799 --> 03:05:44.800
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SHOULD TAKE

03:05:44.867 --> 03:05:46.502
OVER I THINK IS A SERIES OF

03:05:46.568 --> 03:05:47.135
POLITICAL ISSUES AS TO WHY THAT

03:05:47.202 --> 03:05:49.104
SHOULD BE THE CASE. I DO AGREE

03:05:49.171 --> 03:05:51.006
WITH WHAT STERN SAID. PROFESSOR

03:05:51.073 --> 03:05:53.575

OTHER INDICIA OF THE

03:05:54.610 --> 03:05:55.878
CONSTITUTION AS TO WHERE THIS

03:05:55.944 --> 03:05:57.112
DUE TO THE GOVERNOR STEPS IN

03:05:57.179 --> 03:05:58.413

HERE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT

03:06:06.488 --> 03:06:07.856
CLEARLY THE IDEA OF TRYING TO

MERGE INTO ONE ELECTION. RATHER

03:06:09.658 --> 03:06:10.993

FIVE MILLION DOLLAR COST WE

LINE OF SUCCESSION ISSUE. THAT

03:14:50.278 --> 03:14:52.447

ONLY NINETY DAYS AND I THINK I

03:35:05.058 --> 03:35:06.360
RECALL NINETY DAYS THAT THEY

03:35:06.426 --> 03:35:08.562
COULD FIND- I LIKE A PROFESSOR

03:35:08.629 --> 03:35:10.931
ROBERT CHRISTIAN ON THE IDEA.

03:35:10.998 --> 03:35:12.633
WITH HAVING WON THE ELECTION

03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:14.434
AND THEN DOING A RUN OFF

03:35:14.501 --> 03:35:16.503
AFTERWARDS BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT

03:35:16.570 --> 03:35:17.738
TAKES A LONG FOR HELPING TO

03:35:17.804 --> 03:35:19.206
SERVE BY ELECTIONS AND THEN YOU

03:35:19.273 --> 03:35:20.440
HAVE TO PREPARE FOR NEXT

03:35:20.507 --> 03:35:22.276
ELECTION CO THAT GAP. IT MIGHT

03:35:22.342 --> 03:35:23.710
BE A LITTLE TOO LONG NINETY

03:35:23.777 --> 03:35:25.312
DAYS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LONG

03:35:25.379 --> 03:35:26.346
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO A

03:35:26.413 --> 03:35:28.115
STATEWIDE SPECIAL IN THE RUN

03:35:28.181 --> 03:35:30.317
OFF- SO QUICKLY- LIKE BECAUSE

03:35:30.384 --> 03:35:31.818
SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO

03:35:31.885 --> 03:35:34.254
AND ALSO- ONE IDEA THAT I HAVE

03:35:34.321 --> 03:35:35.956
A PART THAT MIGHT BE OUT OF THE

03:35:36.023 --> 03:35:37.858
BOXES WITH THE RECALL WHETHER

03:35:37.924 --> 03:35:39.826
IT THE OLDER PASSES IN EXTENT

03:35:39.893 --> 03:35:41.695
SOMEBODY'S TERM TWO YEARS. SO

03:35:41.762 --> 03:35:42.929
THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A

03:35:42.996 --> 03:35:44.498
SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY JUST

03:35:44.564 --> 03:35:45.999
STARTED OUT THE NEW GOVERNOR

03:35:46.066 --> 03:35:47.267
AND THEY HAVE TO GO ELECTION IN

03:35:47.334 --> 03:35:49.036
LIKE EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS THEY

03:35:49.102 --> 03:35:50.704
HAVE TWO YEARS TO DO ANY OLD

03:35:50.771 --> 03:35:52.506
GREW UP PEOPLE LIKE WILL IT

MIGHT YOU KNOW MESSED UP WITH

03:35:53.373 --> 03:35:55.375
THE CYCLE OF ELECTION BUT I

03:35:55.442 --> 03:35:57.144
THINK GIVING THEM A MINIMUM

03:35:57.210 --> 03:35:57.811
TERM OF TWO YEARS WOULD BE

03:35:57.878 --> 03:35:59.413
GOOD. OKAY REGARDLESS OF

03:35:59.479 --> 03:36:07.721

ABOUT THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD

03:38:34.067 --> 03:38:35.702
IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS THAT IN

03:38:35.769 --> 03:38:37.170
OTHER STATES SOME OF THE

NUMBER IS HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA

03:38:41.475 --> 03:38:42.342
BECAUSE OF OUR LARGER

03:38:42.409 --> 03:38:44.277

THE HIGHER NUMBER OF SIGNATURES

03:38:52.252 --> 03:38:54.321
TO GATHER. THE THRESHOLD SHOULD

03:38:54.387 --> 03:38:56.356
BE BASED ON PERCENTAGE AND IT

03:38:56.423 --> 03:38:57.824
SHOULD BE INCREASED TO BE

03:38:57.891 --> 03:38:59.793
SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES WE CALL

03:38:59.860 --> 03:39:01.528
IT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR

03:39:01.595 --> 03:39:02.929
WHEN SOMEONE'S PRESENTLY IN

HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE

JOB. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

03:42:22.162 --> 03:42:24.297
TERRORIZE THEIR OWN PEOPLE

CREATED THE BASIS FOR THIS

03:42:54.994 --> 03:42:56.730
IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION

SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK TO

TEACHER BERMAN YOUR WORK- TO

03:43:01.968 --> 03:43:04.738
BRING A REAL BREATH OF- OF

03:43:04.804 --> 03:43:06.406

TODAY THROUGH THEM FOR THE MOST

03:43:08.341 --> 03:43:10.510
PART- TO ACTING TO BRING

03:43:10.577 --> 03:43:12.312
EXPERTISE FROM REPUBLICANS FROM

03:43:12.378 --> 03:43:15.148
DEMOCRATS FROM- INDEPENDENCE

03:43:15.215 --> 03:43:16.816
FROM NO PARTY PREFERENCE I MEAN

03:43:16.883 --> 03:43:18.818
WE REALLY TRIED TO STRETCH. AND

03:43:18.885 --> 03:43:21.020
NOT JUST GET ONE POINT OF VIEW

03:43:21.087 --> 03:43:23.123
I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT.

03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:24.491
THAT THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING

03:43:24.557 --> 03:43:26.126
AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT'S

03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:27.393
GOING TO BE THE VOTERS OF

03:43:27.460 --> 03:43:30.830
CALIFORNIA WHO WILL DECIDE OF

03:43:30.897 --> 03:43:31.431
THAT SO WHILE THERE HAS BEEN.

03:43:31.498 --> 03:43:33.032
SOME SUGGESTION THAT A

03:43:33.099 --> 03:43:35.235
SUPERMAJORITY OF ONE PARTY IS

03:43:35.301 --> 03:43:36.736
GOING TO JAM THROUGH ONE REFORM

03:43:36.803 --> 03:43:38.138
OR ANOTHER OR ONE CHANGE

03:43:38.204 --> 03:43:39.939
ANOTHER IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I

03:43:40.006 --> 03:43:41.474
THINK YOUR GOALS IN MIND OR TO

03:43:41.541 --> 03:43:44.344
PROVIDE A BROAD. CONSENSUS

03:43:44.410 --> 03:43:46.446
POINT OF CHANGE IF IT'S NEEDED-

03:43:46.513 --> 03:43:47.847
AND I THINK THAT IS AN

03:43:47.914 --> 03:43:48.481
IMPORTANT POINT THAT WAS MADE

03:43:48.548 --> 03:43:51.017
EARLIER. IS THAT IT'S REALLY

03:43:51.084 --> 03:43:52.185
FOR THE LONG TERM IT'S NOT FOR

03:43:52.252 --> 03:43:54.354
SOME INSTANT. CHANGE ONE THING

03:43:54.420 --> 03:43:59.692
OR ANOTHER THAT. PROTECTS OUR

03:43:59.759 --> 03:44:01.261
DEMOCRACY PROTECTS

03:44:01.327 --> 03:44:03.429
ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OUR ELECTED

03:44:03.496 --> 03:44:07.567
LEADERS- BUT- HAS- ONE OF THE

03:44:07.634 --> 03:44:08.434
WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED

03:44:08.501 --> 03:44:10.637
EARLIER. I KIND OF AVOIDED THE

03:44:10.703 --> 03:44:12.572
CLOWN CAR ELEMENTS THAT HAVE

03:44:12.639 --> 03:44:13.740
FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THIS

03:44:13.807 --> 03:44:15.208
PROCESS SO WITH THAT I THINK

03:44:15.275 --> 03:44:16.476
IT'S YOUR BERMAN FOR YOUR

03:44:16.543 --> 03:44:17.243
LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND LOOK FOR

03:44:17.310 --> 03:44:18.912
TO WORKING WITH YOU- IN THE

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:20.480
MONTHS AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK

03:44:20.547 --> 03:44:21.848
YOU VERY MUCH SIR GLAZER AND

03:44:21.915 --> 03:44:24.651
ADVISERS HERE TO- ONE IF YOU

03:44:24.717 --> 03:44:26.586
HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS SURE

03:44:26.653 --> 03:44:28.421
THANK YOU. I FIRST OF ALL THANK

03:44:28.488 --> 03:44:29.489
YOU EVERYBODY FOR PARTICIPATING

03:44:29.556 --> 03:44:32.292
IN THIS- THIS IS A VERY GOOD

03:44:32.358 --> 03:44:34.060
CONVERSATION TO HAVE. BECAUSE

03:44:34.127 --> 03:44:37.263
THERE ARE QUESTIONS OUT THERE

03:44:37.330 --> 03:44:37.831
THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD

03:44:37.897 --> 03:44:38.431
LIKE TO SEE SOME CHANGES- BUT

03:44:38.498 --> 03:44:40.800
AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THE

03:44:40.867 --> 03:44:43.303
INITIAL TEST.OF WHEN THIS

03:44:43.369 --> 03:44:46.206
PROCESS WAS A DILEMMA DEPT YEAH

03:44:46.272 --> 03:44:48.174
DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN.

03:44:48.241 --> 03:44:50.710
WE'RE SIMPLY A MISUSE OF POWER.

03:44:50.777 --> 03:44:51.311
IT WAS TO CHECK THE MISUSE OF

03:44:51.377 --> 03:44:54.280
POWER. AND YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD

03:44:54.347 --> 03:44:55.515
SOME THINGS IN HERE LIKE THE

03:44:55.582 --> 03:44:57.584
NOTION THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE

03:44:57.650 --> 03:44:59.452
INCAPABLE OF DETERMINING FOR

03:44:59.519 --> 03:45:01.554
THEMSELVES WHAT CONSTITUTES

03:45:01.621 --> 03:45:03.323
EITHER MALFEASANCE OR A MISUSE

03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:06.960
OF POWER- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK

03:45:07.026 --> 03:45:09.295
ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO MILLION

03:45:09.362 --> 03:45:11.598
PEOPLE. ARE ARE. AYE I WOULD

03:45:11.664 --> 03:45:13.733
HESITATE TO TRY TO CATEGORIZE

03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:15.568
THEM LIKE THAT- I THINK OUR

03:45:15.635 --> 03:45:17.403
CITIZENS ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE

03:45:17.470 --> 03:45:20.039
OF DETERMINING WHAT CONSTITUTES

03:45:20.106 --> 03:45:21.841
MALFEASANCE OR AN ABUSE OF

03:45:21.908 --> 03:45:23.610
POWER. YOU KNOW IT'S SIGNATURE

03:45:23.676 --> 03:45:25.745
GATHERING IT APPEARS TO BE

03:45:25.812 --> 03:45:28.114
EFFECTIVE AS IT IS- WE'VE HEARD

03:45:28.181 --> 03:45:29.782
SOME TESTIMONY FROM SOME PEOPLE

03:45:29.849 --> 03:45:30.817
THAT CRUNCH NUMBERS AND ARE

03:45:30.884 --> 03:45:33.019
PRETTY MUCH EXPERTS. THAT IF WE

03:45:33.086 --> 03:45:34.621
MESS WITH THIS WE ARE MAKING

03:45:34.687 --> 03:45:36.589
THE PROCESS WE'RE TAKING IT

03:45:36.656 --> 03:45:37.857
FROM A PROCESS IT'S VERY

03:45:37.924 --> 03:45:39.492
DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW TO NEARLY

03:45:39.559 --> 03:45:42.061
IMPOSSIBLE. AND THAT WILL NOT

03:45:42.128 --> 03:45:44.631
BE LOOKED ON KINDLY BY OUR

03:45:44.697 --> 03:45:47.800
CITIZENS AND VOTERS- NO AND

03:45:47.867 --> 03:45:49.235
LASTLY YOU KNOW I HEARD A

03:45:49.302 --> 03:45:51.738
COUPLE OF TIMES OUR OUR PROCESS

03:45:51.804 --> 03:45:53.806
IS AN OUT LIAR IN THE UNITED

03:45:53.873 --> 03:45:56.109
STATES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

03:45:56.175 --> 03:45:58.111
I'VE HEARD ALL YEAR IS THAT

03:45:58.177 --> 03:46:00.113
CALIFORNIA IS INDEED AN OUT

03:46:00.179 --> 03:46:01.681
LIAR IN DOING THE RIGHT THING

03:46:01.748 --> 03:46:04.284
TRYING TO LEAD THE NATION AND

03:46:04.350 --> 03:46:06.786
WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AND IN

03:46:06.853 --> 03:46:08.121
MAYBE OUR SYSTEM IS GOOD TO

03:46:08.187 --> 03:46:10.523
MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO

03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:11.024
ASSIMILATE TO OUR SYSTEM

03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:13.426
INSTEAD- BUT ANYWAY- THE

03:46:13.493 --> 03:46:15.028
EXPERTS WERE VERY USEFUL AND I

03:46:15.094 --> 03:46:16.296
APPRECIATE THEIRTIME THAT THEY

03:46:16.362 --> 03:46:18.665

THAT YOU'VE DONE IT FOR LIKE A

03:46:51.264 --> 03:46:52.532
WEEK THIS IS CENTER GLAZER AND

I AT YOUR GLAZER AND I'VE GOT A

03:46:54.100 --> 03:46:55.835
LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. LEADING

03:46:55.902 --> 03:46:57.737
UP TO TODAY'S HEARING- AND I

03:46:57.804 --> 03:46:58.805
THINK WE ENDED UP IN A GREAT

03:46:58.871 --> 03:47:01.641
PLACE. WITH A VERY DIVERSE SET

03:47:01.708 --> 03:47:03.609
OF YOU POINTS AND PERSPECTIVES-

03:47:03.676 --> 03:47:05.545
I POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS-

03:47:05.611 --> 03:47:06.546
PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S

03:47:06.612 --> 03:47:08.414
HEARING IN OFFERING A BROAD

03:47:08.481 --> 03:47:10.717
SPECTRUM OF SUGGESTIONS. FOR

03:47:10.783 --> 03:47:13.019
HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK

03:47:13.086 --> 03:47:13.619
FOR EIGHT DO WE EVEN NEED TO

03:47:13.686 --> 03:47:14.954
REFORM OUR RECALL PROCESS OR

03:47:15.021 --> 03:47:15.722
NOT THERE WAS DISAGREEMENT ON

03:47:15.788 --> 03:47:18.157
THAT. BYE BYE TODAY'S WITNESSES

03:47:18.224 --> 03:47:20.760
AND THEN IF SO HOW- AND THERE'S

03:47:20.827 --> 03:47:23.162
PLENTY OF IDEAS. FOR US TO

03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:25.098
FLUSH OUT. OVER THE COMING

03:47:25.164 --> 03:47:26.499
MONTHS AS WE DECIDE WHETHER OR

03:47:26.566 --> 03:47:27.967
NOT TO REFORM THE RECALL

03:47:28.034 --> 03:47:29.502
PROCESS I THINK WE ALL STRONGLY

03:47:29.569 --> 03:47:32.005
BELIEVE- THAT THAT CALIFORNIA

03:47:32.071 --> 03:47:34.107
MUST MAINTAIN A RECALL PROCESS.

03:47:34.173 --> 03:47:35.575
I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN

03:47:35.641 --> 03:47:37.543
WE DEVELOP A SYSTEM WHERE THE

03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:39.379
END RESULT IS IN THE EXACT SAME

03:47:39.445 --> 03:47:40.213
VOTE THAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS

03:47:40.279 --> 03:47:42.415
BEFORE. AND IT TWENTY FOUR

03:47:42.482 --> 03:47:45.251
PERCENT- YOU KNOW VICTORY I

03:47:45.318 --> 03:47:45.985
GUESS YOU WILL FOR THE

03:47:46.052 --> 03:47:49.055
INCUMBENT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT

03:47:49.122 --> 03:47:51.758
SHOWS THAT THE RECALL PROCESS

03:47:51.824 --> 03:47:54.260
IS. TOO EASY TO INITIATE AND

03:47:54.327 --> 03:47:56.529
DOESN'T PROPERLY REPRESENT

03:47:56.596 --> 03:47:57.630
CLOSE TO MAJORITY OF THE

03:47:57.697 --> 03:47:59.332
PEOPLE- IF WE BELIEVE IN A

03:47:59.399 --> 03:48:01.367
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WE SHOULD

03:48:01.434 --> 03:48:05.905
HAVE A PROCESS THAT THAT. AT

03:48:05.972 --> 03:48:07.340
LEAST- CREATES SORT OF LIKE.

03:48:07.407 --> 03:48:08.674
THAT THE RECALL WILL BE

03:48:08.741 --> 03:48:10.743
COMPETITIVE- AND THAT IS WHAT

03:48:10.810 --> 03:48:12.445
WE SAW IN THIS INSTANCE AND SO

03:48:12.512 --> 03:48:15.815
WE SAW WAS. AN EXPENDITURE OF

03:48:15.882 --> 03:48:16.416
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THREE

03:48:16.482 --> 03:48:17.683
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A

03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:18.584
DISTRACTION OF GOVERNANCE FOR

03:48:18.651 --> 03:48:20.486
ALMOST A YEAR- AND THAT'S THE

03:48:20.553 --> 03:48:21.587
ADDED TIME WHEN THEY WERE

03:48:21.654 --> 03:48:23.222
MAXIMUM CHALLENGES ALREADY THAT

03:48:23.289 --> 03:48:24.857
WERE FACING- AND THAT'S NOT

03:48:24.924 --> 03:48:26.626
SOMETHING I BELIEVE THAT'S GOOD

03:48:26.692 --> 03:48:28.828
FOR GOVERNANCE SO- I THINK

03:48:28.895 --> 03:48:30.463
THERE'S- A LOT MORE

03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:31.764
CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD I KNOW

03:48:31.831 --> 03:48:33.566
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER HEARING-

03:48:33.633 --> 03:48:35.635
HOPEFULLY PROBABLY THIS YEAR-

03:48:35.701 --> 03:48:37.036
WALL WALL MOUNTS THOSE DETAILS

03:48:37.103 --> 03:48:39.505
AS WE GET CLOSER- AS WE DIVE A

03:48:39.572 --> 03:48:40.807
LITTLE DEEPER. THE ISSUE OF

03:48:40.873 --> 03:48:42.275
LOCAL RECALLS I THINK IS VERY

03:48:42.341 --> 03:48:44.243
IMPORTANT AND ONE THAT WE PLAN.

03:48:44.310 --> 03:48:46.279
TO DIVE DEEPER INTO- AT THE

03:48:46.345 --> 03:48:47.580
NEXT HEARING BECAUSE I KNOW

03:48:47.647 --> 03:48:48.981
THAT. IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST

03:48:49.048 --> 03:48:50.550
THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL BUT

03:48:50.616 --> 03:48:51.918
BUT IT'S LIKE WE HEARD FROM A

03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:54.120
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- THEN AND A

03:48:54.187 --> 03:48:55.822
LOT OF LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICIALS

03:48:55.888 --> 03:48:57.323
WHO WERE EITHER BEING RECALLED

03:48:57.390 --> 03:48:58.791
OR UNDER THREAT OF RECALL AND

03:48:58.858 --> 03:48:59.759
EVEN BEING NDER THREAT OF

03:48:59.826 --> 03:49:01.027
RECALL. JUST HAVING SOMEBODY
