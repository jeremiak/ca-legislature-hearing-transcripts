COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT

00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:29.568 region:rollup2

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:29:38.377 --> 00:29:40.879 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SCENE EN.

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:41.880 region:rollup2
I'M TAKING IT BACK TO THE

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.785 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:29:44.383 --> 00:29:49.354 region:rollup2
NOW COMES THE.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:51.590 region:rollup2
THE PHONE NUMBER CHOI.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:52.224 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SHARE. I WOULD TO

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.725 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

00:29:52.224 --> 00:29:56.094 region:rollup2
THIS SUMMER SOLUTION.

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:57.996 region:rollup2
THIS HAS SIMPLY TO APPROACHING

00:29:56.094 --> 00:30:00.232 region:rollup2
CONGRESS HAVE TO ADOPT THE.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:02.934 region:rollup2
.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:05.070 region:rollup2
YEAH AND THE PASS A LEGISLATION

00:30:02.934 --> 00:30:05.671 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PERMIT THAT BANKING.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.774 region:rollup2
A CURRENTLY.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:11.176 region:rollup2
I WONDER IF THE INDUSTRY IS SET

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:14.046 region:rollup2
UP ACTIVELY DOING BUSINESS I AND

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:17.582 region:rollup2
UP BANKING IS NOT ALLOW.

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:18.850 region:rollup2
HOW?

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.818 region:rollup2
TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS TO HANDLE

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.653 region:rollup2
THE MONEY AND.

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:23.855 region:rollup2
.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:25.357 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF A LOS?

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:29.661 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THE POTENTIAL A

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:32.898 region:rollup2
REVENUE TO HAVE ANY FIGURES.

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:35.634 region:rollup2
BY ALLOWING WHAT KIND OF A FINE

00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:38.603 region:rollup2
ASIA OR REVENUE BENEFITS JUST

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:40.038 region:rollup2
STATE BILL WOULD REALIZE.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:42.407 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S FOR THOUGHTS

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:43.842 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GAUGE AND COLLECT

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.743 region:rollup2
DATA BECAUSE.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:46.311 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL BRINGING

00:30:44.743 --> 00:30:47.145 region:rollup2
BOTH INTO THE FOLD AND THIS IS

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:49.314 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:50.615 region:rollup2
UP A HUGE STEP IN THAT.

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:52.250 region:rollup2
.

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:54.519 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE YOU KNOW

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.121 region:rollup2
WE AT THE TRADE ASSOCIATION LOST

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:58.123 region:rollup2
OUR BANK ACCOUNTS ON IT IT SEEMS

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:59.858 region:rollup2
TO BE A MATTER OF TIMING RIGHT.

00:30:58.123 --> 00:31:01.226 region:rollup2
SOME FOLKS ARE GIVEN THE

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.527 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BANK

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.628 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT USUALLY WITH THAT YOU

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:05.197 region:rollup2
KNOW CREDIT UNION.

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:06.498 region:rollup2
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY FIND OUT

00:31:05.197 --> 00:31:08.066 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WORKING CANNABIS IN

00:31:06.498 --> 00:31:09.534 region:rollup2
YOUR AND YOU GET THE BOOT.

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.736 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THEN YOU AND SEARCH

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.104 region:rollup2
FOR ANOTHER BANK ACCOUNT AND

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:14.239 region:rollup2
THEN THAT WORKS FOR A FEW MONTHS

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:16.575 region:rollup2
AND THEN EVENTUALLY ONCE MORE.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:18.844 region:rollup2
YOU NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO A

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:20.512 region:rollup2
BANK ACCOUNT SO IT'S IT'S A YOU

00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:23.081 region:rollup2
END UP SORT OF PLAIN YOU KNOW.

00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:24.015 region:rollup2
THIS SORT OF MUSICAL CHAIRS.

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.550 region:rollup2
FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WITH.

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:26.218 region:rollup2
WITH THE BANKS AND IT'S IT'S

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.552 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY.

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.154 region:rollup2
UNITS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:30.622 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNERS AND I CAN TELL

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.890 region:rollup2
YOU WITH A AN EMPLOYEE OF A

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.759 region:rollup2
TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT DOESN'T

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.527 region:rollup2
EVEN TOUCH THE PLAN. YOU KNOW WE

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:38.163 region:rollup2
WERE WE WERE IMPACTED YOU KNOW

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:40.298 region:rollup2
AND SO ON IT IS IT IS QUITE A

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:42.300 region:rollup2
BIT IT'S A QUITE STRESSFUL AND

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:42.868 region:rollup2
AND REALLY DOES INTERFERE WITH

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.602 region:rollup2
JUST OUR DAY TO DAY BUSINESS

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:45.070 region:rollup2
AND.

00:31:43.602 --> 00:31:45.670 region:rollup2
AND REALLY SORT OF PUT US IN A

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.206 region:rollup2
CATEGORY.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:51.243 region:rollup2
OF NOT LEGITIMATE AS NOT LISTED

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:53.145 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE ASK FOR

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:55.113 region:rollup2
YOUR SUPPORT TODAY.

00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:57.916 region:rollup2
AS OF FOR A ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE

00:31:55.113 --> 00:32:00.619 region:rollup2
ARE A LOT OF EACH. OTHER STATES

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:02.254 region:rollup2
ARE SUCH AS A GROTTO. ó WHICH

00:32:00.619 --> 00:32:04.823 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE SAME IN A SITUATION

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:07.626 region:rollup2
LIKE OURS SO IDEA DIFFERENT

00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:10.295 region:rollup2
PRACTICES SEWER. AND.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:12.697 region:rollup2
ANY DATA FROM THEM.

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:13.932 region:rollup2
SO I I KNOW THAT COLORADO AND

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:15.834 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HAVE TRIED

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:17.769 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON AND THEY'VE HAD.

00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:18.837 region:rollup2
ON AND OFF SUCCESS IT IF YOU

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:20.705 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT IT WANNA TALK ABOUT

00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:22.374 region:rollup2
IF YOU TALK TO ANY BUSINESS THAT

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:23.408 region:rollup2
DEALS IN CASH ONLY.

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:25.410 region:rollup2
IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:27.012 region:rollup2
WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.680 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'RE WHERE WE'RE

00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:30.315 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO GET

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.150 region:rollup2
THEM INTO THE MAINSTREAM SO THAT

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:33.618 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THEY PAY THE CORRECT

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.952 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TAXES.

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:37.189 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:39.124 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEFT AND IN.

00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:40.792 region:rollup2
AND MISS APPROPRIATIONS AND

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:42.327 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT NATURE HAPPENS ALSO

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:43.595 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY NUMBERS

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:46.465 region:rollup2
NOW BECAUSE WE JUST STARTED IN

00:32:43.595 --> 00:32:47.632 region:rollup2
JANUARY. OF AS FAR AS HOW THIS

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.734 region:rollup2
IS IMPACTED THIS INTEREST

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:51.837 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SO FAR. BUT I KNOW IT'S

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:53.605 region:rollup2
EVEN BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:54.773 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STATES TO EVEN ATTEMPT

00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:56.975 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEY GET SHUT DOWN.

00:32:54.773 --> 00:32:57.542 region:rollup2
THEY'VE EVERYONE'S TRIED EVERY

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:59.077 region:rollup2
WAY THEY CAN DO TO GET THIS

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.812 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:02.781 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I THINK THIS MAKES

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:05.183 region:rollup2
SENSE SO WE NEED TO.

00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:06.818 region:rollup2
F. SUMS OF STREAMLINED OTHERWISE

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:09.387 region:rollup2

REVENUE WE ARE LOSING.

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:14.626 region:rollup2
