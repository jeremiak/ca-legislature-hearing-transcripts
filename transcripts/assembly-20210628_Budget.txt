THAT IT IS BY PRESENTATION ON THE A BILLS- I'M HERE RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS ALONG WITH MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ALEJO. BERMAN YES HELLO- THIS IS GAVE PADDOCK FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PREPARED PRESENTATION BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS AND I'M JOINED HERE BY US MAN MEMBERS OF OUR OFFICE TO RESPOND AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT. LET'S GO TO THE FLOOR MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR- I'VE GOT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON NUMBER DIFFERENT TOPICS BUT WILL START FIRST- WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND DEBT. THIS IS CERTAINLY A TOP PRIORITY AND WE TALKED WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- IT IS A TOP PRIORITY OF OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS NO FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET. AGREEMENT FOR PAYING DOWN- THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND DEBT CAN SOMEONE SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHY THIS IS THE CASE THAT CLEARLY WITH A DEAD APPROACHING TWENTY FOUR BILLION IS A MAJOR CONCERN. ACROSS THE STATE FROM A NUMBER OF OUR- UP A NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES. HI YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR FONG- ERR CLEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND- YES THERE ARE- THERE IS NOT. A DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT'S DEDICATED TO PAYING DOWN THE FEDERAL YOU I TRUST FUND WHICH WE KNOW IT KNOWLEDGE IS- GROWING TO BE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR BILLION. BALANCE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR- AND WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE- OF. OF IMPORTANCE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE. MUST CONTINUE TO DISCUSS- IN THE FUTURE. OKAY SO JUST FOR GOVERNMENT AND THERE IS NO THERE IS NO DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT FOR PAYING DOWN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND AT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND THEN- CERTAINLY THIS IS- A VERY TROUBLING AND I WANTED TO JUST GET A SENSE OF. WHEN THE IT CERTAINLY WE NEED TO BE PROACTIVE IN DEALING WITH THIS LOOMING BURDEN- IT WAS MENTIONED IN AND OTHER THAN ANOTHER UP AND THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE- BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING THAT THE RESULT WOULD BE HIGHER TAXES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. WHO WE ALL KNOW ARE STRUGGLING AND TRYING TO RECOVER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE INTEREST PAYMENT. WOULD BE TO THE STATE- AS IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER HANDY AT THIS POINT- I'LL AND WILL LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL BRANDON TO SEE IF SHE HAS THAT AND IF SHE DOES THAT WE CAN GET THAT FROM- THE EDT. OKAY IF YOU GET IT ADDED UP TO NEAR YET THOUGH IT. WE'RE GOING TO NEED. HELP BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IS SO THE CURRENT PAYMENT THIS YEAR IS SCHEDULED IS APPROPRIATE AT THIRTY SIX MILLION- WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER- YET FOR THE PAYMENT FOR NEXT YEAR GIVEN THE CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE AND OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE OUTSTANDING DEBT AT THE END OF THE YEAR- BUT HAPPY TO WORK WITH THAT EDT TO GET YOU AN ESTIMATE OF- WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING. THANK YOU. AND MR FONG I WOULD JUST ADD THAT- COMMUNICATIONS CONTINUE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL- IT SHOULD THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. RELIEF FOR THIS FOR STATES- WHO HAVE ACCESS- BALANCES AND THEN FEDERAL TRUST FUND. OKAY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AT LEAST FOR THE PASTTWENTY FOUR DAYS. OF INTEREST THAT HAS ACCUMULATED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX BILLION. ARE THERE ARE SIX MILLION- WITH THE TOTAL ANNUAL PROJECTED COSTS OF. OF YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED. OR SO. MILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST PER YEAR. SO THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING. THAT I CAN SAY IT'S AMOUNTED TO THIRTY SIX MILLION OVER THE PAST TWENTY FOUR DAYS IN INTEREST SO IF WE JUST CALCULATE THAT OUT. ME THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE OR MILLION SO THAT OULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD. LOOK AT TO PAY DOWN THE INTEREST OR THE PAID ON THAT THE PRINCIPLE SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO ENCOURAGE THE THOSE THOSE THOSE INTEREST COSTS- JUMPING TO WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND FUNDING- THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT HAS GOTTEN OLD- HAS GARNERED A LOT OF INTEREST IN THERE SEEMS TO BE. I GUESS A LOT OF CONFUSION AND WE CERTAINLY- I'VE TRIED TO- PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AT LEAST OVER THE WEEKEND IN TERMS OF WHAT IS BEING INVESTED IN WHAT'S HAPPENING SO. THIS IS WHY I UNDERSTAND IT MAYBE CAN CLARIFY IT SAID THERE WAS FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROVED. UNDER EARLY ACTION THAT WAS THE CATCH UP FROM WHAT WAS DONE- DUE TO THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE BUDGET LAST YEAR FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IN JANUARY. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION FOR THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR AND THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FROM TWO WEEKS AGO. HAD A BILLION DOLLARS AT LEAST IN IN THE FRAMEWORK FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. NOW IN THIS AGREEMENT THERE'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS AGREEMENT FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. ONE IS THAT CORRECT INTO WHY WHY DID THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. OR BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED IN OTHER OTHER FRAMEWORKS AND WHY DID IT GO DOWN TO TWO FIFTY TO FIFTY EIGHT. ADDED BOTTOM. YES YES TEN O'CLOCK RIGHT- I'LL ADDRESS THE QUESTION AT A HIGH LEVEL IN TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE- FOR MORE DETAILS- THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE PACKAGE IN THE BUDGET ACTUALLY HAS- SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION- AT GENERAL FUND AND THAT IS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- YOU'RE RIGHT. WITH THERE WAS FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION IN EARLY ACTION OF WHICH- SOME OF THAT WAS GENERAL FUND AND SOME OF THAT WITH CAP AND TRADE IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS AS WELL IN ADDITION TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. SO I WILL TURN ON THE REST OF THE RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE STEVEN BENSON. TWO OF THE FOUR YOU JUMP IN I WAS EIGHT THE CITY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT THERE'S- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. YOU'RE ASSUMING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. NEXT YEAR CORRECT- ARE PHYSICAL BY BUT- THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. BUDGET YEARS SAID. SO IN THIS BUDGET YEAR HOW MUCH IS. FOR WILDFIRES AND WHAT IS THAT COMPARED TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR. SURE AND I'LL TRY THAT AGAIN TO STEVEN BENSON. THE WELFARE PACKAGE- STEVEN BENSON DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE WELFARE PACKAGE DOES INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE SEVEN HUNDRED OR THE FOR THE FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICHEVER NUMBERS YOU WANT TO USE FROM THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES. THAT I ALWAYS ASSUME THAT- THE SPENDING WOULD BE SPREAD OUT OVER MULTIPLE YEARS SO REALLY WHAT THIS PACKAGE RECOGNIZES IS THAT- A LOT OF THOSE ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE OVER A COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT KIND OF SPREADS IN TIMES THE FUNDING TO GO ALONG WITH WHEN THE ACTIVITIES YOU CAN WE CAN GET CAN'T BE COMPLETED. BUT THE PACKAGE STILL DOES HAVE A TOTAL OF SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT OVER THE TWO YEARS OKAY BUT IT IS TRUE THAT. YOU CAN THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CAN TIE THE HANDS OF THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE SO THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A COMMITMENT BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. ALTERNATELY THERE WILL BE A BUDGET BILL NEXT YEAR AND THAT'LL HAVE TO BE YOU KNOW VOTED ON WHATEVER YES I MEAN IT IS A COMMITMENT. WE'RE WE ARE COMMITTED TO A MULTI YEAR SPENDING ON CULTURE OKAY SUBJECT JUST TO BE CLEAR. THE THIS BUDGET YEAR THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. ADDED THE GENERAL FUND FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. CORRECT THE APPROPRIATION IN THIS BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OKAY AND WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR IN HIS ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. THE GENERAL FUND PIECE WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHT. OKAY AND THEN JUMPING TO THIRD DID YOUR F. SO CERTAINLY I'D HAVE SB NINE A ONE THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL COMMITMENT- THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE- DEDICATED. A FOR OVER FIVE YEARS SAID THIS AGREEMENT THAT WERE REVIEWING. HAS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED. WITH AN AMOUNT ON CLEAR MOVING FORWARD IS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT'S THE AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WAS COMPLETED IN CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN HADN'T BEEN FULLY RESOLVED YET AND WHAT STILL ISN'T FULLY RESOLVED YET AND THAT'S WHERE THE REST OF THAT WOULD BE- CONTAINED IN THAT PLAN. IS SEVENTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IT'S IN RIGHT NOW IS KIND OF THE WAY FOR IS GOING TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AMOUNT THIS IS AMOUNTS THAT ARE RATED TO ACTUAL CAL FIRE CREWS. AND THE STAFF AND GOES WITH THOSE INCREASED COMPLETION OF THOSE ONGOING PROJECTS HEALTH SO WE CONCLUDED THAT AS KIND OF A BASE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON LEVEL FUNDING AND THEN WHEN THE CAP AND TRADE PLAN IS FINALIZED THAT FOR THE REST WILL BE CONSIDERED OKAY. SAID DO YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE THEN THAT. THERE WOULD BE. AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ADDED IN CAP AND TRADE OR EVEN MORE AS WE I WOULD ADVOCATE OTHERS WOULD ADVOCATE. AT EVERY GEOGRAPHIC. THE NEW. CONTINUES TO PROPOSE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE MAYOR VISION AND INCREASING. OKAY AND THEN THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S FOR AS YOU SAID TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON SO THAT'S NOT FOR ANY ADDITIONAL. WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IT IS TO FUND THE BRUISE THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE WHEN ASKING A ONE FIRST OKAY OUT. I GOT OF A SELF SAID IN THIS YEAR'S. IN THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR JUST SO I'M CLEAR TWO AND A FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AT THE GENERAL FUND. AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ADDED AT A. GIGI R. F. WITH. A D. V. D. I HAVE THE GREENHOUSE GAS FOR A G. OR F. NEGOTIATE IN THE FUTURE AND A HOPE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S WHAT THE BUDGET ASSUMES YES OKAY. MISTER BY WHERE DOES ALSO POINT OUT OUTSIDE OF THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY PACKAGE WHICH IS AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN CALIFORNIA'S FIRE PREVENTION OF AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS- YES ITS BUDGET- AND- ANOTHER TEN MILLION FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WELFARE OF FORECAST ABOUT INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION CENTER AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH AND DEALING WITH- FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES OUTSIDE OF JUST THAT WILDFIRE. AND OF COURSE RESILIENCE PACKAGE SO I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT THERE IS A CLOSE TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND- BEING USED ON TOP OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION IN EARLY ACTION FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. CERTAINLY THAT I THINK FOR US TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS A LET THEM SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT- I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN A NAME FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THEM. THAT THEY THE KEY COMPONENT OF THIS STRATEGY TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IS A SUSTAINABLE AND CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT. INTO OF OUR PREVENTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE NUMBERS FROM BUDGET YEAR TO BUDGET YEAR. EITHER CHANGES OR THERE TO BE TO BE DETERMINED AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M TRYING TO. TO DELVE INTO- WHEN IN IN MY QUESTIONS BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- BUT THE INFORMATION- INTENTIONS ARE JUMPING TO HOMELESSNESS- THAT'S ONLY A BIG INVESTMENT THAT IS BEING MADE. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME- SOME INFORMATION OR OR FEEDBACK OR- BACKGROUND ON TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE DATA AND ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED WITH THIS FUNDING AND IN TERMS OF DISBURSEMENT. HOW HOW ARE HOW IS THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING TO ENSURE THAT ALL REGIONS NOT JUST A MAJOR URBAN CENTERS I WISH CERTAINLY NEED INVESTMENT- AND IN TERMS OF- PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS BUT AS WITH OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUNDING AS WELL- IT SURE I JUST- START WITH. THE-FACT THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDES ELEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION IN THE HOMELESS- IN FUNDS TO ADDRESS VARIOUS HOMELESS. YES PROGRAMS- I WILL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS HELP- FOR SPECIFICS- IN REGARDS TO YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. A CRYSTAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DISPERSAL OF THE- MONEY IN THE BUDGET IS STILL A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION TRAILER BILL STONE WORK. BUT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT- ALL CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CONTINUANCE OF CARE RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THEIR NEEDS. OKAY SO AGAIN YOU DOUBLE DEEPER IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE KIND OF KENNEDY MEASURES BEING CONSIDERED. WITH THE MONEY THOSE ARE STILL MATTER THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FINALIZED YET YOUR WITH YOU AT THIS POINT IN TIME OKAY AND THEN FOR THE FORMULAS FOR DISBURSEMENT THAT ARE- THAT STILL BEING WORKED OUT AS WELL. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THEY ARE OKAY- JUMPING TO WATER AND THE DROUGHT HAS CERTAINLY- I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA AND- IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE MISSED OPPORTUNITY FROM THE LAST- WATER BOND TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT HEADWAYS. HEADWAY INTO MAKING AND TO MAKING WATER STORAGE REALITY- WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION ON MORE WATER STORAGE- AND WOOD THE MEASURE SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF NEW WATER STORAGE- WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING FOR DROUGHT MITIGATION. I'LL TURN THAT QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE- SERGIO AGUILAR. HEY GOOD MORNING SIR GO ARGUE AFTERNOON SIR JACK ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS LOADING I'LL JUST GO COUPLE THINGS- PROPOSITION ONE THAT. TWENTY FOURTEEN DID HAVE SOME WATER STORAGE MONEY THAT- THE COMPANY WHAT IS IT STILL- GOING FORWARD WITH AND IS KIND OF IT HAS A SCHEDULE OF CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA BE FAITH THEN FOR THOSE EXPENDITURES- IN THIS CURRENT- WATER IS GOING PACKAGE- THERE ISN'T A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION FOR WATER STORAGE. HOWEVER ALL JUST KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT ONE BILLION GENERAL FUND THAT IS DEFERRED TO SUMMER DISCUSS. AWARE THAT REMAINS TO BE ALLOCATED BUT THE CURRENT TWO POINT THREE SEVEN BILLION THAT IS ALLOCATED IN THIS BUDGET- DOES NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE INVESTMENTS HAVE AGAIN JUST NOTING THAT PROP ONE DID HAVE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN EXPENDED YET BUT ARE IN THE PROCESS. SURE AND I AND I THINK THAT'S THE- PROBLEMATIC FOR MYSELF REVERTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THAT. PROP ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO. PROVIDE SOME WATER STORAGE RELIEF THAT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO TO PREPARE FOR A DROUGHT. THAT WE ARE NOW IN. AND SO THE FACT THAT IT'S TAKEN SEVEN YEARS TO MAKE THAT LOCATION IS SOMETHING THAT. AS A FRUSTRATION OF MINE BUT- I GUESS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT OF USING SOME OF THAT MONEY FOR WATER STORAGE. YEAH I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS OVER THE SUMMER ON HOW TO ALLOCATE THE REMAINING TWO POINT ONE BILLION GENERAL FUND THAT IS PART OF THE WATER RESILIENCE AND DROUGHT PACKAGE THAT IS STILL TO. RELATED. OKAY BUT THAT WASN'T A FIRM YES OR NO BUT- I DO- I DO HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL LISTEN TO THE PLEAS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THAT IS DEALING WITH THE DROUGHT IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY OUR OUR LIVELIHOODS ARE ON THE LINE- AND- THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE- JUMPING TO YOU- I BREATHE AS SORRY FOR THE SCATTERED AS THE JUMPING EDUCATION- THIS. AGREEMENT ALLOCATED ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- BUT IT DOESN'T SPECIFY WHICH SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE SO ARE ALL SCHOOLS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING THAT WOULD BE. PUBLIC CHARTER NOT CLASSROOM CHARTER IS THAT IS MY IS MY READING CORRECT ON THAT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WILL TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM- EDUCATION UNIT TO RESPOND TO THAT. HELLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AIR INDIA PART OF FINANCE. I IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION ON THE TRAILER BILL FOR EXPANDED LEARNING. THE FIVE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT WITH OPERATING ON A CLASSROOM BASED PROGRAMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT MONDAY. THE ONLY CLASSROOM BASE NOT NOT NON CLASSROOM BASED. THAT'S CORRECT. IN THAT MAY I ASK WHY THAT IS. THE THOUGHT THAT NONE OF THESE BONDS ARE TO BE USED FOR EXPAND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM BUT MORE THAN LIKELY ON CAMPUS AS PART OF THE SERVICES THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE BOTH WHEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOL IN THE CLASSROOM BASED PROGRAM AS WELL AS EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL- WHICH HAPPENS ALEX SAID AT AFTER SCHOOL SITES. AND THAT IT THINKING. OKAY WELL THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY HERE AYE AYE I DO FEEL THAT THAT THE NON GLASS AND BASS CHARTERS OR ARE BEING PICKED ON- APPEAR BUT- DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVEN BY GO AHEAD A LOT OF PARENTS PUT THEIR CHIP CHILLED PUT THEIR CHILDREN INTO NON CLASSROOM BASED ENVIRONMENT SO IT WOULD MAKE SENSE T ME THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO THE FUNDS- AND THEN I APPRECIATE THE JOB THE CHAIRS INTELLIGENCE ALL DISTRICT. LAST THEY GO TO BROADBAND- THE BUDGET APPROPRIATE THREE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD- YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MILES OF MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND. HOW DOES THIS AGREEMENT ENSURE THAT IT'S BUILT IN AREAS. WITHOUT ANY BROADBAND SERVICE WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE UNSERVED- AND WHAT IS THE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ULTIMATELY. A BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER TO CONNECT THOSE UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. THANK YOUNG TURN THAT QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE DAVE IN THEM NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YES THE BUDGET APPROPRIATES SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR. LAST MILE MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT YOU MENTIONED. I'M SORRY THAT REALLY FAST COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN I APOLOGIZE I CAN'T QUITE CATCH THAT. NO PROBLEM YES- THE BUDGET APPROPRIATES. SIX BILLION DOLLARS TOTAL TO DOUBLE THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT AS OF LAST MILE MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS. SO I GOT THE AMOUNT SO HOW DOES IT INSTEAD AS IT ENSURED THAT THE BROADBAND BILL IS ACTUALLY GOING INTO UNSERVED AREAS DO YOU HAVE THAT THE FIND IS THERE. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES TASK FOR- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE CONCERN IS THAT. AS THE AS THE FOLKS ARE GING INTO THE MIDDLE MILE- THE OF. THE SPACE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE AREAS THAT ALREADY MAY ALREADY BE SERVED WITH. A BROADBAND BUT IN RURAL AREAS WITHOUT BROADBAND ARE GONNA GET INVESTMENT. SO HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT WORK BUT I CERTAINLY YES ANDERSON. YES CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN- DISCUSSIONS ARE CONTINUING ON- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THIS pTO- GET BACK TO YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION- WHAT THE STATUS QUESTIONS HAVE CONCLUDED. OKAY SO I'M A I ADMITTEDLY AND I KNOW THAT I'VE TALKED TO THE CHAIR THERE'S A LOT TO BE DETERMINED AND FUTURE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I THINK THAT'S I THINK A REOCCURRING THEME IN THIS AGREEMENT I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE HAVE. SOME SIGNIFICANT STAY PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO. HELPING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WITH WITH YOU AE- AND- FUND DEBT PAYMENTS AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AND THEN WE HAVE. A LOT OF- ACTUALLY A LACK OF CLARITY WHEN IT COMES TO WATER STORAGE WHICH I THINK HAS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. IF WE'RE GOING TO PREPARE FOR DROUGHTS. IN THE FUTURE- AND WE NEED TO LEARN OUR LESSONS IN THAT MISSUS OPPORTUNITY AND OF COURSE WITH WHEN IT COMES TO YOU. BOB I PREVENTION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- CLEARLY AS WE DO AS WE GO WE'RE GOING INTO A- A WILDFIRE SEASON THAT COULD BE VERY VERY CATASTROPHIC. I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THE NUMBERS KEEP FLUCTUATING- SO- I DO APPRECIATE- YOU PROVIDING THE ALLEYS SOME ANSWERS EVEN THOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY CLEAR BUT- IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON- AND I AND- YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME SERIOUS RESERVATIONS- MOVING FORWARD BUT- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOING BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR CARTER. YEAH ON THE AB IS PIGGY BACKING A LITTLE BIT ON. THE VICE CHAIRMAN'S COMMENTS ON THE AND QUESTIONS ON THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION FRONT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH- A WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS. FROM WILDFIRE PREVENTION THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS- AND CERTAINLY HIRING NEW. HIRING SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS EARLIER IS A PROVIDE IS A- YOUR PREPAREDNESS THING HAVING MORE BUT YOU SEEN MONIES IN CALLOW YES TO RESPOND TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IS A PREPAREDNESS THING BUT IT IS NOT PREVENTION. THE ONLY SUREFIRE WAY TO DO PREVENTION IS TO REDUCE FUELS TO REDUCE FUEL LOADS THROUGH ALL THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED. MANAGEMENT PROCESS PRESCRIBED BURNS THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IN THIS BUDGET. THOSE ACTIVITIES PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. IS NOT A BILLION LIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. IT'S NOT TWO BILLION LIKE HE SAID IN MAY. IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTED ON TODAY IT'S TO ME IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT- AND THEN IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MAYBE. IN SOME FUTURE BUDGET YEAR. THAT THAT'S WHAT IT IS OKAY AND SO MY QUESTION A D. O. F. IN THIS IS REALLY SIMPLE WHY NOT DO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WE DO HAVE A WAY OF. MAKING A COMMITMENT TO SUSTAIN FUNDING DO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IF YOU LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET. FIVE YEAR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION WHY NOT DO. CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION WHY ISN'T THAT THE APPROACH WHY ISN'T THAT BEFORE US TODAY. I'M CURRENTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'LL TURN THIS QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE IN A MOMENT BUT AGAIN JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE FACT THAT THE ONE BILLION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION WAS REALLY A MULTI YEAR- EFFORT- AND- THE SAME WITH US. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION OVER MULTIPLE YEARS- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT IN BUDGET YEAR- IN REGARDS TO A COMMITMENT WE HAVE BUILT IN THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OBVIOUSLY THINGS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE COMMITMENT IS TO FIND- IT AND MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN IN THE- IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS AN EARLY ACTION BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS BUDGET YEAR AND BEYOND. BUT I WILL. IT'S NOT A COMMITTED THOUGH UNLESS IT'S A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT SO YOU CAN SAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND THAT'S MY UESTION WHY ISN'T IT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION IF THIS IS A PRIORITY. WHY ISN'T A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. WELL AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE BULK OF THE ON GOING COMMITMENTS THAT WE MAKE IN THE BUDGET ARE NOT CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS THEY ARE BILLS IN OUR OUR SYSTEM AND THAT IS THAT GENERALLY THE TECHNICAL WAY OF DOING THAT- I DEFERRED TO STEVEN IN REGARDS TO A- CONTINUES APPROPRIATION BUT THAT IS- MORE. MORE UNUSUAL THAN HAVING- BUILT IN- FUNDING PER YEAR. STEPHEN VANCE WOULD DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO THAT THE ONE THING AID START CLARIFYING IS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS ACTUALLY A ONE TIME. INCREASE SO THE AMOUNT THAT'S IN CAL FIRE'S BASED BUDGET FOR FIRE PREVENTION AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWO POINT SIX MILLION. SO THE TWO HUNDRED TWO POINT SIX MILLION PLUS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION RESULTS IN ABOUT TWENTY. ABOUT FOUR AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR FIRE PREVENTION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS BUDGET. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION- THAT'S THAT'S REALLY A BUDGET FRAMEWORK DISCUSSION- YEAH EIGHTH AND STRUCTURALLY WHO POINTED OUT. OUR GENERAL APPROACHES YOU KNOW WE MAKE COMMITMENTS FOR ALL THESE ONGOING PACKAGES- AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW THE TECHNICAL SYSTEM WORKS- SO I A LOT OF IT IS IT'S ME AGAINST BUDGET FRAMEWORK WE HAVE A LOT OF ONE TIME. REVENUE SO WE MAKE ONE TIME EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS WITH THOSE. NOT IT'S NOT NEW BECAUSE SB NINE OH ONE. OUTLINED A FIVE YEAR. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AT LEAST OUT OF CAP AND TRADE- FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND AGAIN I MEAN I GUESS. I'M USED TO IT YOUR BEFUDDLING THINGS. I MEAN YOUR BASE BUDGET FOR CAL FIRE IS NOT WILDFIRE PREVENTION. ITS OPERATING CAL FIGHTER. TO DO THE A TREMENDOUS JOB THAT THEY DO EVERY YEAR. FIGHTING FIRES AND PROTECTING US BUT THAT'S NOT PREVENTION. OKAY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION IS WHAT'S IN THERE FOR PREVENTION. ALL RIGHT. AND I'M JUST SAYING IT SHOULD BE A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. YOU GUYS ARE WILLING TO DO THAT. YOU COULD. BUT YOU'RE NOTWILLING TO DO THAT WHICH WHICH IS TROUBLING TO PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO DON'T WANT HAVE TO FIGHT EVERY YEAR. TO GET MONEY IN THIS BUDGET. FOR PREVENTION THAT NEEDS TO BE JUST AUTOMATIC OKAY THAT'S MY POINT. BUT LET'S GET TO THE SECOND QUESTION WHICH I THINK IS MORE IMPORTANT. THE NPR ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT OUTLINED HOW THIS JOB ISN'T GETTING DONE EVEN WITH THE MONEY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS. YET AND THAT THAT IS BEING. ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SUPPOSED TO BE EXECUTED BY THE EXECUTIVE. TO GET THIS WORK DONE YOU TOUTED ON HOW MANY HOW MUCH ACREAGE YOU'RE DOING NINETY THOUSAND. ACRES ACTUALLY WAS ONLY ELEVEN THOUSAND. SO WHAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT ALONG WITH THIS MONEY NOW THAT WE'RE ALLOCATING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE. THAT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE ACTUALLY. IS COMPLETED. AND THAT WE'RE NOT JUST HOW THE NUMBERS THAT ARE REAL. AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION- CALIFORNIA'S ENTIRE BASE BUDGET IS NOT FIRE SUPPRESSION- IT'S NOT IT THERE IS A BASE BUDGET. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FOR FIRE PREVENTION. AND MUCH OF THAT IS THE- RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE TWENTY MILLION THAT CAME FROM SB NINE A ONE BUT AS NOTED EARLIER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THE ASK YOU KNOW NO ONE FUNDING. IS NOT YET IN THIS BUDGET BECAUSE THE CAP AND TRADE PLAN IS STILL GETTING FINALIZED SO THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWO POINT SIX MILLION THAT I CITED INCLUDES ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OF THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION BUT THE REST OF THAT IS BASED BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET. FOR FIRE PREVENTION. IN TERMS OF. WORK GETTING DONE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS CALIFORNIA IS AS CAL FIRE REPORTS TO US THE NINETY MILLION ERROR THE NINETY THOUSAND ACRE HI NUMBER WAS THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT WAS BEING. PROTECTED BY THE THIRTY FIVE PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT WERE DONE I IN MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN AS CALIFORNIA REPORTS TO US WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FUEL BREAKS IT'S NOT UNCOMMON BOTH TALK ABOUT TERMS OF ACREAGE PROTECTED AS WELL AS A CHRISTIAN. SO I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS THAT ONE IS A GREAT STREET AND THE OTHER IS A CREEK PROTECTED. OR YOU CERTAINLY WERE TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT YOU WERE DOING A LOT MORE THAN WAS ACTUALLY DONE AND THAT'S THE POINT IS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE TEETH THAT HAVE WE'RE GONNA ALLOCATE MONEY TO SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ACTUALLY GETS TO THE OBJECTIVE OF TREATING THE ACRES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING TO WHERE EVERYBODY TALKS TO EVERYBODY EVERYBODY AGREES THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. A YEAR IF WE WANT TO GET ON TOP OF THIS PROBLEM. ASSEMBLY WAS MICHAEL LARA WAS QUOTED IN THAT FROM STANFORD THIS YEAR ONE OF THE LEADING EXPERTS ON THIS THAT YOU NEED TO BE DOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN DOING NINETY. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GONNA ALLOCATE RESOURCES THAT WE THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. THEY ALSO SPEAKS TO IF WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE THAN THEY WISH TO DO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUSTAIN FUNDING FOR IT. SALAS AND WITH THAT I MEAN IT EBBS VERY PROBLEMATIC TO ME. THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- INSURING A SUSTAINED FUNDING SOURCE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA MISS FIGHTERS. THANK YOU I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP- ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DEBT- SO DID TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHY CAN'T WE ALLOCATE MORE THE FEDERAL MERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDS TO HELP PAY DOWN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DEBT. YES THEY ARE CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT- ALTHOUGH THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING- BUT FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET THERE ARE. PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF OUR FUNDS AS WELL AS OTHER FUNDS- NOW AND THE REALITY FOR THE U. I TRUST FUND IS THAT- WE HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN IN TRUST FOR OUR THROUGH SEPTEMBER AND OUR ESTIMATES FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR- IN REGARDS TO INTEREST OUR LOW ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THEY WERE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WAS UP FIVE HUNDRED BILLION IS NOW I BELIEVE FIFTY MILLION- AND THE FOOD OR THE FEDERAL TAX- INCREASES THAT WILL OCCUR BUSINESSES WILL NOT OCCUR FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS AND SO WE'RE HOPING IN THE INTERIM THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR SOME INTEREST RELIEF- AND AT THAT IT COULD AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- TO LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN REFORM OUR STATE SYSTEM. OKAY SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS JUST NOT HIGH ENOUGH ON THE PRIORITY LIST NOW I'D LIKE THE L. A. O. TO WEIGH IN HERE. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAST TIME WE ARE IN A RECESSION AND WE ANCHORED UP I THINK IT WAS ELEVEN BILLION. AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT I WOULDN'T PAY THAT DEBT OFF UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. FROM THE OVER THE PAST YEAR WE'VE LOST ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES MOVING FORWARD WILL NOT OBVIOUSLY BE PAYING. INTO DID THIS FUN SO TO THE L. A. O. ONE WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION ON WHAT WE DO NOW- ONE ALSO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHILE WE'RE KNOCKING KERING INTEREST NOW IN THROUGH SEPTEMBER. AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A FEW YEARS ONCE WE GET ON TO THE YOUR THREE WILL ANCHOR AT 3% INTEREST AN ADDITIONAL 3% INTEREST EVERY YEAR UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID OFF. SO TO THE L. A. L. WHAT'S THE EXPECTATION. OF US IF WE DON'T PAY THIS AT OFF FOR THE NEXT DECADE LIKE IN THE PREVIOUS. BOND DEBTS WHAT WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST WOULD BE PAYING. DOLLAR AMOUNTS. THIS IS GET CREDIT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WELL WE DON'T AT THIS TIME HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THAT- I THINK OUR OUR ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW IS BEEN THAT THERE WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN ANNUAL ANNUALIZED INTEREST COSTS RELATED TO THE DAD OVER THE LONGER TERM- I COULD- I COULD CERTAINLY TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN YOU OR TO SEE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANY. ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT IT. GET UP YES THANKS GABE- THERE'S A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES THAT GOING TO ESTIMATING KIND OF THE LONG TERM. INTEREST COST. INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE STATE- BUT OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE THAT SOME MORE. OVER THE NEXT DECADE THE STATE'S INTEREST COSTS WILL BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF AND FIVE. BILLION DOLLARS. IN TOTAL. TWO AND A HALF TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS YOU KNOW- PRETTY EXTENSIVE EXTRICATE SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TWO AND A HALF TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ISN'T A PRIORITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION- SO MY LAST QUESTION IS ALSO FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME CLARITY AS TO- HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET FOR PROP SIXTY THREE MEN PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT. SURE BUT BEFORE- I RESPOND TO THAT AND I WILL PROBABLY TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR THAT I JUST WANT TO- CLARIFY THAT- THANK YOU I FIND CONDITION IS. IS A PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION IT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON TO JUST ONE. IT ON THE RECORD SAYING THAT- BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR THE QUESTION ON PROP SIXTY THREE. THANK YOU. WE ARE ALMOST A PERMANENT FINANCE WALDRON HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME THE PROXIMATE LI TWO BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WELL I WOULD LOVE SOME CLARIFICATION ON YOU KNOW HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. PROBLEM IN OUR STATE EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT- ON THE PANDEMIC IS EXACERBATED THAT SO UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE RESPONDING THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOING BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MISTER JOHN. FOR THE WITNESS GROUP DID YOU KNOW MISTER JONES ARE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I JOIN MAKE A COMMENT ON THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SB ONE FIVE NINE. CCPO ACE CONTRACT. AND- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY. HAS MORE REASON. DID ANYBODY ELSE IN HIS ROOM PROBABLY ANYBODY ELSE THE STATE. TO VOTE NO ON THIS. AS AN SEIU MEMBER FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE PRAISING PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES THAT DURING THE TIME WHEN WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO HAVE ANY MONEY. THEY TOOK CUTS. THEY DID THIS THING THE RIGHT THING. THEY TOOK BACK BENEFITS TO THE COULD HAVE TAKEN DURING A TIME. WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA BE STRAPPED BY FIFTY SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. THEY TOOK THE INITIATIVE OR THEY WERE ASKED TO TAKE INITIATIVE. TO NOT TAKE AS MUCH MONEY. AS A FORMER EMPLOYEE FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE'RE DURING REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE BUDGET STRAIGHT- MY UNION SEIU. A SEVEN TO ONE AND OTHERS IN THE CITY UNION DID NOT TAKE- RAISES FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL THE CITY WAS BACK ON HER FEET. AND THEN IT WAS A CITY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THIS WHOLE- WHEN I LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN A LOT OF THIS WE ARE MAKING THEM WHOLE. AND WE SHOULD MAKE NOT JUST CCPOA BUT ALL THE OTHER UNIONS THEY CAME TOGETHER. I MADE SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS. BUSINESS WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD TO TAKE LESS SALARY AND FEWER BENEFITS. IN ADDITION- THIS YEAR. I PUT FORTH A- SOMETHING MENTAL HEALTH. TO HELP WITH THE CCPOA OFFICERS. THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND I MENTIONED ON THIS FLOOR THAT'S IN OF TEN. FOR MORE INDIVIDUALS EVERY YEAR ARE DYING FROM SUICIDE. IN A SUICIDE TO PROBABLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN WHAT GOES ON WITH PRISONER ASSAULTS. AND SO WE HAPPENS IN HERE LIKE THE PANDEMIC RELATED HEALTH AND WELLNESS- WE HAVE A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT DAY. THAT EFFECTIVE ON THE FIRST DAY OF A PAY PERIOD FOLLOWING RATIFICATION BY BOTH PARTIES THE ONE TV THAT WAS SUSPENDED FOR COUNTY OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WILL BE RESTORED- UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL THAT I PROPOSE WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT CCPOA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY WALK TO TOUGHEST BEAT. AROUND WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH- DID NOT DID NOT MAKE IT. AND WITH THE WISDOM OF OUR CHAIR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT COMMITTEE- WE PUT IN THE BILL. THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WILL BE PART OF THIS AND- IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING WHETHER NOT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FORCE PEOPLE WHICH WE CAN'T DO LEGALLY. TO GO VISIT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL EVERY YEAR. THIS PAST FRIDAY A FRIEND OF OURS. KNOWING THIS HOUSE BUT A WELL RESPECTED MEMBER OF CCPOA STEP WALKER'S SON- COMMITTED SUICIDE. AS AND HE'S A MEMBER OF CCPOA A PAROLE OFFICER. THAT'S IMPORTANT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO IS THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. I'M AND YES I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS. M. O. U. DATA GO THROUGH BUT I WANT US IF WE COULD AND OUR TIMING IS EVERYTHING IF WE COULD BEEN ABLE TO ROLL BACK TO TIME TO INCLUDE THIS MENTAL HEALTH PROVISION THAT I WAS WORKING ON. IN THIS DEMO YOU IT IS A WAY WE COULD COME BACK. AND ADD THIS ON I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A BIG BIG BIG DIFFERENCE IN IN IN THE LIVES OF A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO CARRY A BADGE- IN CCPOA IF WE DO ARE ABLE TO DO THAT- I WOULD ASK. THAT IF WE'RE ARE ABLE TO. BRING THIS MENTAL HEALTH PROVISION IN ALL THEIR CONTRACT. THAT WE NAME IT AFTER STEPHAN WALKER'S SON. BECAUSE THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE NEED TO GET MORE INTO HERE. THAN ANYTHING ELSE OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE MORE READ MORE ATROCITIES INDIES IN THE PRESENT AND- ULTIMATELY- WE WILL BE ABLE TO HEAL PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED TO SIT DOWN AND TALK SOMEONE TO SOMEONE LOOK IN HERE WORK WERE GIVEN DAYS. DAYS OFF. WE'RE DOING A LOT OF REHABILITATION EFFICIENCY MEASURES- WORRIED GREEN TO CONTINUE ME QUARTERLY AN ADDRESS EFFICIENCIES AND- AND A REHABILITATION MEASURES WITHIN TO SEEK THE CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR CLASSIFICATION. THERE'S A LOT IN HERE THAT KIND OF GOES AROUND THE EDGES BUT DOESN'T REALLY DIG DEEP INTO MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO AB. I BELIEVE WE CAN DEFINITELY MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH WITH THE MO YOU BUT I REALLY REALLY ENCOURAGE US BIGGEST EMPLOYERS THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY UP MISTER CHAIR THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMETHING TO HELP WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH.
