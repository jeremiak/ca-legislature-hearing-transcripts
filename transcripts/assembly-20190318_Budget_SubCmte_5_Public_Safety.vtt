DEPARTMENT.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.434
I'M GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:32.037
OVERVIEW ON HOW WE PRIORITIZE

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.905
OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY --

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:35.473
PROJECTS BUT I WANTED TO

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.676
INDICATE THAT THE PRIVATIZATION

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:39.144
PROCESS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY.

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.645
IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:41.880
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ITEM AND

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.949
ITEM TWO AND SO INSTEAD OF BEING

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.283
REDUNDANT THERE I THOUGHT IT

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.518
MIGHT BE GOOD TO SHOW TO SHOW

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:47.819
YOU HOW WE DO THAT.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:49.087
AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE IMPORTANT

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:52.424
AS IT FEEDS INTO HOW WE'RE GOING

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.892
TO BE DOING OUR TWELVE PRESENTS.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.293
SO JUST A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.995
THE DEPARTMENT OPERATES THIRTY

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.763
FOUR STATE OWNED FACILITIES --

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.065
OVER FORTY THREE MILLION SQUARE

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:01.933
FEET AND ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.335
STRUCTURES.

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:04.736
ARE FACILITIES ARE OLD EVEN OUR

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:06.571
NEWER PRISONS HAS A REFER TO OUR

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:09.241
OLD 60% OF OUR FACILITIES AT OUR

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.876
IN FACT THIRTY YEARS OR OLDER.

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:13.945
AND 35% OR FIFTY YEARS OR OLDER.

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:16.081
AND WHAT WHAT THIS MEANS TO US

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:18.216
IS THAT WE'VE GOT CONDITIONS IN

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:19.885
OUR FACILITIES WHERE THE USEFUL

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.219
LIFE THAT WAS PLANNED FOR THAT

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.821
FACILITY.

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.156
HAS LONG SINCE EXCEEDED AND SO

00:25:25.223 --> 00:25:27.325
IN RECOGNITION OF THAT IN TWENTY

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:28.660
ELEVEN WE PERFORM SOME CONDITION

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:29.761
ASSESSMENTS.

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:31.162
WITH AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT THAT

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:33.198
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.166
DEFICIENCIES --

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:36.568
THAT EXISTED IN OUR PRISON

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.503
PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.038
THEY WEREN'T REPLACED.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:41.306
DURING THE THAT RECOMMENDED

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.709
CYCLES ASSESSMENT YIELDED AN

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:47.379
AVERAGE RATING ACROSS OUR

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:49.047
PORTFOLIO OF 60%.

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:52.784
INDUSTRY STANDARD --

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:55.153
FOR FOR FACILITIES OF OUR TYPE

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.523
IS THAT IF YOU ACHIEVE A 65%

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.525
MORE OR MORE RATING --

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:01.993
THAT CAN THAT FACILITY CONDITION

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.628
IS KNOWN AS POOR ARE EXTREMELY

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.630
POOR AND WHAT THAT TELLS ME AS A

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:07.065
FACILITY --

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.668
MANAGER IS THAT I HAVE TO START

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.870
A PLANNING CYCLE THAT IDENTIFIES

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.271
HOW THAT FACILITY CAN BE

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:14.539
REPLACED OR SIGNIFICANTLY

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.508
REPAIRED SO CAN CONTINUE TO

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:18.376
OPERATE FOR ITS PURPOSE --

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:19.377
SO --

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.646
WITHOUT IN HAND IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.815
WE STARTED TO SUBMIT AYE.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.951
A SERIES OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:28.086
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:29.821
AND WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO GET

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.489
A NUMBER OF A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.091
APPROACH APPROPRIATIONS ALONG

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:34.592
THE WAY --

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:36.795
BUT WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:39.230
TODAY IS THE PLANNING PROCESS

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.599
THAT WE UNDERTAKEN WE DO THIS

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:42.133
WORK.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.870
SO I'M PLANNING IS IT RUDE.

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:46.938
ITERATIVE.

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:48.440
I'M MORE ALWAYS IN THE PLANNING

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.742
STAGE -- WE

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:53.011
ARE ALWAYS OUT IN THE FIELD WE

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.379
SPEAKING --

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.313
TO CODE OFFICIALS ON WHAT

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.915
UPCOMING CODE CHANGES ARE IN

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:57.882
PLACE.

00:26:57.949 --> 00:26:59.484
INTERACTING WITH REGULATORS ON

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.953
SOME OF THE OUR FACILITIES THAT

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.521
HAVE REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS.

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:04.789
AND SO WE'RE ALWAYS GATHERING

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:05.991
THAT INFORMATION.

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:07.559
I'M AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:08.760
WE'RE GATHERING THE FIELD

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.428
INFORMATION ALSO SPEAKING TO

00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:12.364
EXECUTIVES. TO MY COLLEAGUES

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.366
HERE TODAY CAPPING ALISON INJURY

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:16.801
BASCO ART TO KEY EXECUTIVES THAT

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:18.069
I WOULD SPEAK TO BECAUSE IN

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.371
ADDITION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:20.038
THE GROUND.

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.239
THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:22.707
IMPACTING --

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:24.376
HOW WE OPERATE OUR FACILITIES

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.511
THERE ARE POLICY IMPLICATIONS

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.346
THERE ARE TRENDING INFORMATION?

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.681
MISSION CHANGES --

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.016
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE

00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:32.784
IMPORTANT INPUT INTO THE

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.452
PLANNING PROCESS FOR WHAT SOUNDS

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.187
LIKE A SIMPLE --

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:38.590
FACILITY RELATED --

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:40.525
EXERCISE.

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:41.993
SO SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.762
LOOK AT ONE WORD DOING THIS THIS

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:45.730
EFFORT IS WE LOOK AT WHERE OUR

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.665
ASSETS WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:48.767
THESE ASSETS.

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:49.334
DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ON THE

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.369
ASSETS HOW ARE THEY OPERATING

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:52.937
FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE --

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.072
WHAT ARE --

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.306
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:57.108
KEEP THAT ASSET OPERATING IN SO

00:27:57.175 --> 00:27:58.676
AGAIN ALL OF THOSE --

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:01.913
INPUTS ARE IN PLACE I'M ONE OF

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.948
THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT IS IS

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.384
THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT JUST

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.119
LOOK AT STATE ON ASSETS BUT

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:10.255
CONSIDER OP PRIVATE OR OUTSIDE

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.589
ASSETS.

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.124
AND SOMETIMES THAT MAKES SENSE

00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.626
BECAUSE THEY CAN --

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.094
DELIVERED TO US FASTER FOR

00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:17.896
HAVING A POPULATION PRESSURE BUT

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.130
SOMETIMES IT JUST MAKES SENSE

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.165
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:21.399
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THAT

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:23.034
POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.135
A SMALLER SETTING.

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:26.371
SO WE LOOK AT NOT ONLY HOW WE

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.106
PRIORITIZE ASSETS FOR STATE

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.574
OWNED BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:32.110
AN OFFRAMP. TO DELIVER THAT THE

00:28:32.177 --> 00:28:34.813
NEEDED MISSION IN A DIFFERENT

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:35.847
FASHION.

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.049
SO THAT'LL SETS THE STAGE FOR

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.784
THE VERY FORMAL PROCESS WE CALL

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.086
THE CALL LETTER PROCESS.

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:44.189
WHERE WE SEEK --

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.591
EACH INSTITUTION TO SEND US A

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.893
DETAILED PROJECT --

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.495
SCOPE TO US WITH PRELIMINARY

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.629
COST ESTIMATES.

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.631
THOSE COME IN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:54.666
AND THEN WE SIT DOWN WITH THE

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.234
EXECUTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:57.268
OPERATING DIVISIONS.

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.870
AND WE GO THROUGH THEM AND THE

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.839
THE FACTORS WE USED TO DETERMINE

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.440
WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:03.541
PRIORITY PROJECT.

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:04.676
IS IT NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.077
STATUTORY AND REGULATORY

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.278
REQUIREMENTS.

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.013
DOESN'T ADDRESS FIRE LIFE SAFETY

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.982
CONDITIONS IS IT NEEDED TO

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:12.317
ADDRESS THE COURT MANDATE.

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:14.119
IS IT NEEDED TO ADDRESS ACCESS

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.386
COMPLIANCE.

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:16.688
IS IT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.089
ONGOING OPERATIONS IN

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.524
PROGRAMMING HEALTH CARE HOUSING

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:20.959
SECTOR.

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:22.660
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:24.262
LIST THAT WE'RE GATHERING

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.997
BETWEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:27.532
SPECIAL CARE AND CAPITAL OUTLAY.

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.702
IS THAT WE ALSO ASK IS THE

00:29:30.768 --> 00:29:32.103
PROJECT THAT IS NECESSARY TO

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.305
IMPROVE UPON THOSE OPERATIONS SO

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:35.006
THAT.

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.541
IMPROVEMENT THAT BETTERMENT IF

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:39.377
YOU WILL IS TYPICALLY FALLS IN

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.146
THE CAPITAL OUTLAY DOCKET.

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:43.114
SO ONCE WE REACHED INTERNAL

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.416
CONSENSUS AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:46.818
CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT.

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.053
WE GATHER ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.355
PROJECTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:52.157
NECESSARY TO BETTER THE

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:53.925
OPERATIONS --

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.593
THAT EXIST IN OUR PRISONS AND

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.162
THOSE ARE SUBMITTED TO THE

00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:58.730
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EACH YEAR.

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.598
I IN AUGUST OF EACH YEAR AND

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.700
DEPENDING ON HOW ON THEIR VIEW

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:04.202
OF OF THESE PROJECTS.

00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:05.503
THERE ARE SUBMITTED IN THE

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.271
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND IF

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:08.006
APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.507
AND ACT UPON THEM.

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.709
I'M THE COMMITTEE HAS I BELIEVE

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:12.977
A SUMMARY OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:15.413
REQUEST AND I'D BE HAPPY.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.817
TO SPEAK ABOUT THOSE PARTICULAR --

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:20.919
PROJECTS IF YOU'D LIKE

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:21.219
[inaudible]

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:23.655
I'M. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.623
ASKED FOR WAS THE TWELVE PRISON

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.192
STUDY THE UPDATE ON THE TWELVE

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:29.794
PRISON STUDY --

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:30.895
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.931
ABOUT THE CAP OUT LIKE TO MOVE

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:33.965
ON TO THE TOP PRISON STUDY.

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:36.768
OKAY SO THE TWELVE PRISON STUDY --

00:30:36.834 --> 00:30:38.836
IT'S IT'S IN A SENSE OF FOLLOW

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.238
ON TO THE INITIAL FACILITY

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.807
ASSESSMENT THAT WE DID IN TWENTY

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:43.675
ELEVEN IT'S A DEEPER DIVE A FEW

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:44.375
WELL.

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:45.610
IT'S TAKING --

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.879
THE A SERIOUS LOOK AT OUR TWELVE

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.747
OLDEST PRISONS KNOWING THAT THEY

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.149
WILL HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR USEFUL

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.483
LIFE MUCH FASTER THAN OUR NEW

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.185
PRISONS --

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.787
AND INDEED IF YOU'VE BEEN TO

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.590
SOME.

00:30:58.656 --> 00:30:59.991
I'M.

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.859
BEFORE I GO INTO THAT --

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:05.797
TOLD PRISON STUDY I WANT --

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:07.398
TO BE CLEAR THAT.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.467
WHEN PEOPLE CALL 206-7 WAS

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.668
ENACTED?

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.270
THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US TO

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:14.038
CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS IN

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.174
EVALUATING --

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.809
WHETHER OR NOT ARE FACILITY

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:20.278
RELATED REQUESTS --

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.180
WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING.

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:24.048
I THINK I OUTLINED FOR YOU THE

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:26.884
CRITERIA THAT THAT WE USE IN THE

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:30.521
PLANNING EFFORT TO DEVELOP THIS --

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:32.090
THIS APPROACH.

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.225
I WANNA GIVEN A COUPLE EXAMPLES

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:36.160
OF HOW WE VIEWS THE TWENTY SIXTY

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.829
SEVEN LANGUAGE.

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:40.131
I'M IN EARLIER IN THE DECADE

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:41.566
WHEN THE JUVENILE FACILITY

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:43.668
POPULATION WAS DECLINING WE DID

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:44.936
A SIMILAR ANALYSIS TO WHAT'S

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:47.605
BEING ASKED HIM --

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:48.139
TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AND WE

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.907
DETERMINED THAT BASED ON THAT

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:52.010
ANALYSIS THAT WE COULD CLOSE --

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.778
SEVERAL JUVENILE FACILITIES.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.013
AND WE LOOKED AT FACTORS THAT

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.414
WERE IMPORTANT IN JUVENILE

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:57.849
OPERATIONS ARE THEY IN

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:01.552
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE --

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.621
WELL SERVED BY VOLUNTEERS.

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:04.956
ARE THEY IN COMMUNITIES WHERE HI

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:08.359
FOLKS COULD HIRE EFFECTIVELY --

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.928
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE ASSET

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:12.463
SPENCE NEEDED FOR THAT ASSN WE

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.898
USE THAT SAME PRIVATIZATION

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:14.932
PROCESS?

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:16.868
ON TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:19.037
WE ALSO USE A SIMILAR PROCESS

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.938
WHEN WE EVALUATED A DECLINING

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.675
FEMALE POPULATION.

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.976
POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.879
DECLINE WE WE EVALUATED OUR

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:29.714
PRISONS AND DETERMINED WE COULD

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.815
CLOSE.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.517
AND REPURPOSE --

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.485
THE VALLEY STATE PRISON AND AND

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.454
TURN IT INTO ADULTS BUT KNOWING

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:37.155
THAT THERE WAS A POPULATION

00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.857
SHORTFALL WE OPENED A FEMALE

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:41.526
FACILITY IN FOLSOM.

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.860
AND WE DID THAT AGAIN WITH ALL

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.395
THAT CRITERION MIND --

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.230
FULSOME IS A GOOD LOCATION FOR

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.398
HIRING --

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.200
FEMALES --

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.935
AND AND IT'S A SMALLER FACILITY

00:32:51.002 --> 00:32:51.936
SO SO IT'S WILL SERVICE.

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.472
THE NEED WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.074
FOR THREE LARGE PRISONS WE WE

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.743
STILL HAD NEED MORE THAN TWO SO.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.244
ON THE FULL SOME WOMEN'S

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:05.083
FACILITY GAVE US ENOUGH OF THE

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:06.250
OF THE BUFFER THERE.

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:06.818
I'M I'M.

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:07.819
A REAL KEY INDICATOR FOR US IS

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:08.786
THE POPULATION --

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:13.157
THAT WE SERVE SO WE LOOK AT A

00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:15.927
FIVE YEAR HORIZON FOR IT FOR OUR

00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:16.594
POPULATION AND THE REASON WHY WE

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:17.462
LOOK AT THE FIVE YEARS IS

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.163
BECAUSE IT TYPICALLY TAKES FIVE

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:20.665
YEARS FROM INCEPTION OF AN IDEA

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.567
OF A PROJECT.

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:23.201
TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING ON THE

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:25.436
PROJECT SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT --

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.573
FACTOR FOR US AND WE ACTUALLY --

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:29.607
MAINTAIN WHAT'S CALLED A GAP

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.976
CHART IT'S IN THE A AND A MASTER

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:33.411
PLAN THE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES.

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:34.912
AND THAT GOT CHART LAYS OUT

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:36.514
WHERE OUR POPULATION IS AND

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.983
THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS WE USE --

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.584
WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR PLANNING

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.685
EFFORT?

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:43.454
I'M SORRY I WANTED --

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.589
TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:46.524
THAT'S IMPORTANT --

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:47.759
PIECE OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.227
PLANNING THE FUTURE ALL THOSE

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:50.528
CRITERIA ARE IN FACT QUITE HERE

00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:51.763
WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE JUST

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.531
GONNA BE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC AND

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.366
HOW WE INCLUDE THAT.

00:33:55.433 --> 00:33:58.002
PLANNING EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE.

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:00.037
SO THE TOTAL PRISON STUDY AGAIN

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:02.473
OUR IS A DEEPER DIVE IN THE

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.641
CONTINUATION OF OUR FORMER

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.109
ASSESSMENTS.

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:07.512
AND WE'LL ASK THE CONSULTANT TO

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.647
DEVELOP A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:11.015
WE NEED --

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:12.150
THAT WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.118
CONTINUE TO MAY AFFECT OF

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.620
OPERATIONS IN OUR PRISON.

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.588
I'M I'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF THOSE

00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:19.757
EARLIER DRAFTS AND THOSE DROPS

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.058
INDICATE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:22.794
COMBINATION OF SPECIAL CARE AND

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.695
FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS BUT

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:27.131
ALSO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS --

00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:29.500
UNFORTUNATELY THEIR WORK HAS --

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.568
SUFFERED --

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:33.438
THEY HAVE I THINK THAT THEY

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:34.972
UNDERESTIMATED THE WORK EFFORT

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.808
THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO THE

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:38.042
TWELVE PRISON STUDY.

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.643
ON THE EARLY DRAFTS THAT I'VE

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:42.847
SEEN WOULD PROVE LITTLE UTILITY

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:44.382
FOR US AS A DEPARTMENT IN

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.817
DETERMINING WHERE.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:48.085
WE NEED TO INVEST OUR PRECIOUS

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:49.887
RESOURCES GOING FORWARD SO WE

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.489
SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:54.158
TIME WITH THEM WORKING ON AT ITS --

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.194
AND CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENT --

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.062
THEY'VE HAD ANY NUMBER OF ERRORS

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:02.133
FROM COST ESTIMATE ERRORS --

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.470
TO PROJECT TWO FALSE ASSUMPTIONS --

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:08.039
ON WHAT PROJECTS WOULD BE NEEDED --

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:09.674
TO PROCEED AND IT'S JUST BEEN A

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.409
PRODUCT THAT --

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.978
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT READY FOR

00:35:14.045 --> 00:35:18.249
PRIME TIME.

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:21.519
COMMENTS FROM LA L..

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:22.687
CAITLYN LA --

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:23.821
WE DIDN'T RAISE CONCERNS ON THIS

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:25.389
PROPOSAL OKAY WHAT ABOUT --

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.258
FINANCE.

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:29.060
OKAY ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS.

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:32.797
YES MISTER.

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.599
TEN SO I I APOLOGIZE FOR WALKING

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:35.600
AND THEY SEE MY PRETTY COVER

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.568
THIS BUT CAN YOU CHANGES WALK

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:39.303
THROUGH WHY THE DELAY

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:39.604
[inaudible]

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.272
SO -- YOU

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:42.640
KNOW IT'S JUST A MYRIAD OF

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:43.975
FACTORS --

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.775
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.878
NEEDED TO DO WAS TO USE CERTAIN

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.179
REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FROM THE

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:49.747
DEPARTMENT.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.916
AS AN EXAMPLE AND THEIR EFFORT --

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.885
I THINK THEY HAD A GREATER

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:56.220
EXPERT TAKE EXPECTATION OF THE

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:58.456
DEGREE OF DOCUMENTATION ON

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.491
BLUEPRINTS FOR THE OLDER PRISONS

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.293
THAT EXISTED --

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.362
THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY KEY WHEN

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:05.229
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.797
WHAT'S BURIED BENEATH WALLS AND

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.332
FLOORS --

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.067
AND WE SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.869
FOR SOME OF THE ESPECIALLY SOME

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:13.538
OF THE VERY OLD PRISONS --

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:15.172
AND SO THEY HAD TO SPEND A

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:17.208
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.010
TRYIN --

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:21.312
UNDERSTAND THAT ON THEIR OWN --

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:25.249
THEY ALSO WE ALSO OF THE FORMER

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:27.818
SCA ASSESSMENT DONE BY AND

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:28.719
ANOTHER.

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:31.422
CONSULTANT AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.957
THEY THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:34.792
PROVE VALUABLE TO THEM BUT I

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.561
IT'S A NEXT IT WAS AN EXTENSIVE

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:38.362
AMOUNT OF DATA I DON'T THINK

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.263
THEY REALLY.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.265
APPRECIATED UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:43.167
COULD TRANSLATE THAT DAY IT DATA

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:45.102
INTO THEIR WORK EFFORT.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:49.774
SO THOSE INITIAL REPORTS CAME IN --

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.075
WITH --

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.176
THINGS LIKE COULD NOT

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:55.046
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO APPLY THE

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.081
FCI INDEX IN A WAY THAT WOULD

00:36:57.148 --> 00:37:02.787
INFORM US AS A PROPERTY OWNER --

00:37:02.853 --> 00:37:03.387
WHERE SHOULD WE SHOULD INVEST

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:04.355
OUR MONIES?

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:05.823
SO FACILITY CONDITION INDEX OR

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.426
FCI IS A SORT OF A STANDARD A

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.728
METRIC USED BY COMMERCIAL --

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:13.531
OPERATORS INDUSTRIAL OPERATORS

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:15.066
EXCEPT TRUCK.

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.567
TO PUT A PEN IN AND I'M AN

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.370
AMOUNT TO AN IN A CONDITION.

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:23.140
OF YOUR YOUR FACILITY AND IT HAS

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:24.308
RANGES FROM.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:27.578
POOR TO FAIR GOOD EXCELLENT AND

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.847
TYPICALLY IT'S DRIVEN BY THE

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:31.148
USEFUL LIFE OF THE PROPERTY.

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.918
IN OUR CASE --

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:36.687
WE HAVE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.689
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.525
OF BURIED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.227
THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE WALLS THAT

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.762
HAVE A SHORTER USEFUL LIFE.

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:45.663
SO -- I

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.632
THINK THAT MAYBE THAT WAS

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.000
PERHAPS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:49.967
THEY STRUGGLED WITH THIS

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.202
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:52.703
THEY ALSO STRUGGLED WITH

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.271
SUBMITTING TO US PROJECTS THAT

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:55.706
JUST BECAUSE THEY EXCEEDED THEIR

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.541
USEFUL LIFE THEY PRESENTED THEM

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.443
AS PROJECTS THAT WE SHOULD

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.211
PROCEED WITH.

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.179
BUT WE WE WANTED TO TAKE A

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.649
DEEPER DIVE IN THAT AND LOOK AT

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:05.716
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS IT

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:08.419
EXCEEDED IS YOU ITS USEFUL LIFE.

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.654
IS IT INDEED OPERATING IN A

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.523
DECENT CONDITION CAN WE RELIABLY

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.058
COUNT ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.227
FACILITY OR SYSTEM TO CONTINUE

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.396
TO OPERATE IN THAT FASHION.

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.296
AND SO WE'VE.

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.564
LOOKED AT REDUCING SOME OF THE

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:22.967
PROJECTS THAT THEY BELIEVE WERE

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.769
NECESSARY SIMPLY BECAUSE A LIFE

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:25.970
AND IT'S JUST A NUMBER.

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.605
YOU KNOW IT SOME OF OUR

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.173
FACILITIES OUR SERVER OLDER

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.474
FACILITIES LOOK --

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:31.909
ACTUALLY BETTER THAN SOME OF OUR

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.344
NEWER OFFICES.

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:34.745
SO IT'S A NUMBER BUT IT'S IT'S A

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:37.081
IT'S A GUIDE IF YOU WELL IT'S

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.016
NOT A HARD AND FAST --

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:40.618
NUMBER TWO FOR US TO REALIZE.

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.353
WHAT WHAT'S TYPICAL USEFUL LIFE

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.722
FOR THE EXTERIOR AND AN INTERNET

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:45.322
FOR FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.157
FOR AN END TO WHAT THEY CALL

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.792
INDUSTRIAL GRADE BUILDING IF IF

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:49.326
IT WAS A TYPICAL OFFICE BUILDING

00:38:49.393 --> 00:38:51.095
YOU'RE IN THE THIRTY YEAR RANGE?

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.530
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:54.532
WE AS AS ASSET OWNERS DON'T

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:55.833
DEMOLISH A THIRTY YEAR OLD

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.867
BUILDING.

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.269
YOU KNOW WE FIGURE OUT HOW --

00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:01.906
TO CAN BECAUSE THE STRUCTURES

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.441
YOU KNOW ARE ARE FAIRLY --

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.342
IN FAIRLY GOOD SHAPE IT'S THE

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.977
SYSTEMS THAT FEED INTO IT THAT.

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:09.080
THAT REALLY START TO SUFFER AGE

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.815
SEE SAID FIFTY TO FIFTY FIVE

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.149
YEARS FOR THE EXTERIOR.

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.918
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERIOR --

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.520
WELL WERE UNIQUE IN THAT WE TEND

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:18.589
TO SUFFER --

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.157
EXTREME WEAR AND TEAR.

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:22.560
ALMOST ABUSE IF YOU WILL --

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:25.162
AND SO WHERE IT'S THE WHERE IT'S

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:28.566
AN AREA THAT HAS A LOT OF LOT OF

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.334
SYSTEMS THAT ARE TOUCHABLE LIKE

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.736
KITCHENS --

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.637
THOSE TEND TO HAVE A LOT MORE

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.106
WEAR AND TEAR.

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.640
WE HAVE PRETTY STURDY STRUCTURE

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.409
SO A LOT OF CONCRETE WALLS

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:38.976
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MUCH

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:40.311
DAMAGE TO THE GIVES YOUR

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.046
ESTIMATE FORMER [inaudible]

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.881
I'M.

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:46.083
I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY IN THE

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.485
SAME VEIN THE INTERIOR

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.086
STRUCTURES.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.921
ARE IN THE SAME VEIN SYSTEMS ARE

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.623
MORE IN THE TWENTY TO THIRTY

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.225
THIRTY YEAR RANGE.

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:55.559
LIKE WATER SYSTEMS YEAH OUR

00:39:55.626 --> 00:40:00.364
SYSTEM YEAH.

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:03.934
THE SOUL ON THIS REPORT WAS BE

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.171
COMPLETED FALL OF EIGHTEEN THE

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:08.439
SUMMER OF NINETEEN NOW WOULD NOT

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.641
THE DATE IS.

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:13.144
JUNE TWENTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.346
NO NO NO NO IT IT WE'RE STILL

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:17.081
PLANNING ISSUE YEAH WE STILL

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:20.017
WANTED DOING THINGS HERE IT IS A

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:20.651
REASON WHY CAN'T BE DONE BEFORE

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.553
THE FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS IS

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.254
COMPLETED.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.322
YEAH I THINK WE WE CAN CERTAINLY

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:26.791
LOOK AT THAT --

00:40:26.857 --> 00:40:28.492
YOU KNOW I I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.895
IT'S A DOCUMENT THAT WE ARE

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.263
CONFIDENT --

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:35.933
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF OF IS THAT

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.469
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IT I

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:39.837
THINK WE'RE CLOSE ON THE RIDGE.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.405
WE USE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.174
FACILITY AS IT AS A TEMPLATE A

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.375
FORMAT IF YOU WILL SO LET'S

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:45.776
FIGURE OUT HOW TO WRITE IT UP

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:47.044
FOR ONE FACILITY.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.412
AND THEN MOVE FORWARD --

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.447
AND USE THAT SAME FORMATFOR THE

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.383
OTHERS IN HINDSIGHT THAT WAS

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.585
PROBABLY NOT THE BEST CHOICE

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.886
BECAUSE IT'S SO COMPLEX AS A

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:58.789
MAJOR REASON WHY THEY CAN'T BE

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:02.493
DONE BEFORE MAY FIFTEENTH.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.228
I'M OR WHAT IS THE REASON I

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.129
CAN'T GET THEM FROM THE TWELVE

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.664
SO REMEMBER SO THEY ARE BEING

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.134
PRODUCED IN INDIVIDUAL CHAPTERS

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:10.668
TO EACH PERSON HAS ITS OWN

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:11.969
CHAPTER.

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.337
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITY IS

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:15.272
CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.774
EXECUTIVE BODY SO THAT'S THE

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.375
FEDERAL RECEIVER'S OFFICE AND

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:19.643
THE UNDERSECRETARIES AND THE

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.212
DIRECTORS --

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:22.112
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:23.714
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR MISSION

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:26.283
AND THEIR GOALS. FOR THE ASSET.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.652
I'M IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CMS

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.254
SO THAT YOU CAN GET A FLAVOR FOR

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.322
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.590
POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:34.525
TO CIRCULATE THE EARLIER I'D

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.426
HAVE TO CHECK WITH STAFF TO MAKE

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.260
SURE.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.528
BUT THEN EACH ONE THAT FOLLOWS

00:41:37.595 --> 00:41:39.463
IS IS FOLLOWING ON A FASTER PATH

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.565
BECAUSE THE FORMAT WAS REALLY

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.267
THE STRUGGLE TO GET THAT SO SURE

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:43.934
THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.603
IT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED IN A

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.905
FORMAT THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.473
WHO'S NOT A FACILITY PLANT

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.976
PERSON CAN UNDERSTAND AND SO

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.210
THAT'S BEEN OUR FEEDBACK TO IT.

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:54.845
THE REPORT IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:57.114
SHE'S A LOT OF ABBREVIATIONS AND

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.115
YOU'RE TRYING TO WHAT WAS THAT

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.350
AGAIN YOU'RE GOING BACK AND

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.252
LOOKING FOR IT SO IF THAT WAS

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.987
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS GOING

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:03.921
FORWARD IS.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:06.223
TO HAVE IT WRITTEN IN A FASHION

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.993
THAT THIS PERSON COULD

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.127
UNDERSTAND IT.

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.695
THIS SALUTE THE SUPPORT HOW DO

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.497
YOU DEVELOP YOUR CAPITAL

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.032
IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES.

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:16.066
WHEN YOU HAVE AND FINISH THIS

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.434
REPORT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:18.535
REQUEST THE COMMAND?

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.204
THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO FUND SO

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:21.805
I THINK OUR OUR CHALLENGES IS.

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.942
WITHOUT A LIST OF PRIORITIES OR

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:27.144
WITHOUT A METHODOLOGY.

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.046
THE REQUEST KEEP COMING IN THAT

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:32.449
THERE'S NO OVERALL STUDIES SO

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.717
HOW WOULD YOU WHAT.

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.252
WHY WOULD WHY WOULD WE OR WHY

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:38.022
SHOULD WE --

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.890
INVEST MONEY WITHOUT THIS REPORT

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:40.958
BEING DONE.

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.793
I CAN APPRECIATE THE HESITATION

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.628
THE CONCERN --

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:46.230
WE ARE I'M NOT SURE WHEN YOU

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:47.498
JOINED IN MY EARLIER

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.300
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:51.001
PRIORITIZE AND AND IT'SACTUALLY

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.037
VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE TENANTS

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:56.073
OF OF THE PENAL CODE.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.207
TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN I'M.

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.209
IT IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.611
PROJECTS THAT WERE SUBMITTING.

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.112
TODAY THE CAPITAL PROJECTS IN

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:02.613
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.847
PROJECTS ARE ALL CRITICAL

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:04.949
PROJECTS.

00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:06.550
WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:09.787
ABSOLUTELY NO IN SIN CAFFEINE'S

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:11.221
HERE TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.056
IMPACTS.

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:14.024
ON THESE THESE PROJECTS HAVE ON

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:14.858
HER --

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.560
OPERATING CONDITIONS THERE ISN'T

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.262
A PROJECT THAT WE'RE SUBMITTING

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.530
HERE TODAY THAT.

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.065
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.333
WOULDN'T CONSIDER --

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:23.968
FOR THE TWELVE PRISONS IN FACT

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.769
IN LOOKING AT THE FEW --

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:28.839
THAT I'VE READ SO FAR --

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.040
A NUMBER OF THE PROJECTS ARE

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:30.874
ALREADY IN THE THE TOLD PRISON

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.776
CITY SO THEY'RE IDENTIFIED THE

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.411
SAME THING WE'RE IDENTIFYING --

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:36.213
AT AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT WE

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.681
DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS FOR

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.750
MAKING THESE REQUESTS AND IN

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:41.118
TURN MAKING HIS INVESTMENTS AND

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:42.386
I CAN SAY I HAVE NO REGRETS

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.220
BECAUSE THEY SEE THESE

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.955
CONDITIONS I SEE THE IMPACT TO

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:47.591
THE TO THE PRISONS IF WE WAIT.

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:48.726
ANY LONGER --

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.527
THE WAY CONSTRUCTION COSTS WERE

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.062
THE PRICES SIMPLY GO OUT.

00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:53.797
SO I I THINK THAT THE PROJECTS

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:55.165
WERE SUBMITTING HERE TODAY ARE

00:43:55.232 --> 00:43:58.369
NOT PROJECTS THAT WE WOULDN'T --

00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.871
WE WILL WE BELIEVE OUR WOULDN'T

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:02.506
BE NECESSARY IN THIS TWELVE

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:03.674
PERSON STUDY --

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.676
I MEAN I'M I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:08.078
IN SAYING THAT HERE TODAY BUT

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:12.449
KNOWING THAT WE HAVE FINING

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:14.318
POPULATION I I CAN APPRECIATE

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.220
YOUR CONCERN AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:17.488
WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THE

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.023
RIGHT FACILITIES --

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:21.125
GOING FORWARD.

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.226
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:24.428
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT --

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.663
THE REPORT WILL HIGHLIGHT BUT

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.298
IT'S OBVIOUS WE HAVE LEAKING

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:30.167
ROOFS INTO CELLS AND TODAY ROOMS

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:32.603
AND CLASSROOMS I HAVE TO WE HAVE

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:34.171
TO SHUT DOWN CLASSROOMS ON A

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.439
REGULAR BASIS.

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:37.508
WE HAVE WE HAVE ONE INSTITUTION

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.142
THAT'S BEEN DOWN FROM THIS TWO

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.043
YEARS.

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:41.211
SO YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING AN

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:42.813
ADEQUATE EDUCATION.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.681
NOW WITH FIFTY SEVEN THAT QUIT

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.417
CELEBRITY AND SO TO HE

00:44:46.483 --> 00:44:48.152
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN YEAH WE WE

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:49.253
WE AGREE WE SHARE THE SAME

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.654
CONCERN AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:51.822
WERE HERE.

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:54.324
LAST YEAR SELECT GROUNDHOG DAY

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.893
AGAIN I MEAN SECRETARY KERN AND

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.394
CAME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND

00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:59.863
YOU KNOW I HAD REQUESTED.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.267
A REPORT A PRIORITIZATION OF ALL

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:07.471
THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES --

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.006
A YEAR LATER WE STILL HAVEN'T.

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:10.107
SO -- THAT

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:11.675
WAS FOR THE CONDITION UPON US

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.377
DOING APPROPRIATIONS.

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.478
SO.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:17.147
THE WORDS TRUST US IT DOESN'T.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.916
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.451
RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE NOT ASKING

00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:21.885
FOR LUNCH MONEY RIGHT NOW YOU'RE

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.754
ASKING FOR YOU KNOW ALMOST A

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.355
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:26.790
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS WHEN.

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:29.093
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.028
CRITICAL BUT THE THE THE THING

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:31.862
IN BUDGET COMMITTEES

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.530
EVERYTHING'S CRITICAL.

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:34.798
IF YOU GO TO A YOU KNOW RIGHT

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.133
RIGHT NEXT DOOR IS ALL THE

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.135
HOMELESS AS A MENTAL HEALTH --

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.636
DISCUSSION THAT'S CRITICAL SO

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.138
EVERYTHING IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:41.939
SO.

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:42.706
WE HAVE.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:46.043
TO DO A JOB SCHERING THAT OUR

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.912
MONEY IS REALLY FAST SPENT.

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:52.082
INTO SAYING HEY TRUST US.

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:53.951
THE REPORTS NOT DONE.

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:55.519
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.854
WE JUST NEED THE MONEY BECAUSE

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.989
IT'S CRITICAL.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.691
THAT TO SOME OF THE PASS MUSTER

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.259
SO I THINK --

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.827
AGAIN I THINK WHAT YOU'VE

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.562
PRESENTED TODAY --

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.965
DOESN'T FILLED THE REQUEST I

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:10.100
MADE A YEAR AGO --

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.736
DURING SUCH TIME THAT.

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:14.505
THE REQUEST WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:15.339
FOR FELT THAT SHOULD AND

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:17.274
COMMUNICATED TO MY OFFICE TO

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.942
THIS COMMITTEE IT WASN'T.

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.645
SO -- INTEL

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:24.414
THE DEPARTMENT CAN BRING FORWARD

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.150
A BROADER PLAN.

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.818
A BROADER VISION.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:30.254
OF WHERE THEY WANT TO SPEND THE

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.121
MONEY.

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.423
AND WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES FOR

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.859
SAYS HEY HERE'S YOU KNOW THE

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:38.061
BRUCE LEE CUSTOM WE NEED MONEY.

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:42.766
THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE --

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:43.333
ANSWER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.002
BUDGET.

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:46.503
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.139
THINGS MUCH MORE GLOBAL THE AND

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.474
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS MORE

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.809
LONG TERM.

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:54.978
SO -- AGAIN.

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:55.979
THE REQUESTED STILL STANDING

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:57.414
FROM TWELVE MONTHS AGO THIS

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.050
WASN'T A NEW WASN'T.

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:00.684
LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO THIS

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:01.318
IS.

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.453
A YEAR AGO SECRETARY PROMISED

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.454
THAT THEY WOULD GET THIS DONE

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:05.923
AHEAD FALL CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.158
HIM IN HIS TEAM. TO THIS DAY

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.426
HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:10.961
SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:13.830
EMAIL OR MAYBE WENT TO SPAM --

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:16.066
SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN.

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:21.004
HAPPY TO YOU KNOW IT'S ON ME.

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.639
HOW?

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:24.508
HOW THE COMMITTEE CAN EVALUATE?

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:26.076
THESE PROPOSALS BECAUSE OF THE

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.344
DEPARTMENTS [inaudible]

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:28.979
TRACK RECORD.

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:30.781
AN IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:32.482
THE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT'S LACK

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.550
OF VISION.

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:35.953
AND FRANKLY LIKE PLAN.

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.956
SO IF IF THE YOU KNOW THE THE

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.958
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T FOR PHIL I

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.025
REQUEST IT MAKES IT VERY

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:45.696
DIFFICULT FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.231
MOVE THESE THINGS.

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.266
IT'S A FAIR ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:51.768
I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ADVOCATE --

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.237
FOR ALL THE OPERATIONS THAT

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.938
EXIST IN THE PRISON.

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.206
AND I DON'T WANT THE FAILURE OF

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.908
MY ABILITY TO COMPLETE THIS

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.309
REPORT TIMING TO NEGATIVELY

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:00.844
IMPACT --

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.212
THE CONDITIONS THAT EXIST OUT

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.014
THERE SO I'M GONNA DOUBLE BACK

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.749
WITH STAFF TO SEE WHAT THINGS.

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.651
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE SHARED --

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:10.120
PERHAPS EVEN ON A FLOW BASIS --

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:10.687
THAT COULD HELP GET YOU MORE

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:13.824
COME DO INDEED HAVE A PLANNING

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.759
PROCESS.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:16.393
SO I THINK JUST RESTATE I THINK

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.928
WHAT.

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.696
WHAT AT LEAST I'M NOT JUST

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:20.764
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF?

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:24.835
WHAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IS?

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:29.706
A LIST OF A LIST OF PRIORITIES.

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:30.641
BY THE THIRTY FOUR FACILITIES

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.809
WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:34.444
AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:35.012
AND YOU TO THESE FACILITIES

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.847
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.148
CALM AS ALWAYS FIX THIS ROOF BUT

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.650
REALLY THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.450
DOWN THE ROAD HERE.

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:42.753
SO SO THIS MAY BE TO THE

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.855
EMERGENCY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.290
WHAT'S THE TOTAL DEPARTMENT.

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:47.758
BECAUSE WE WERE IN CHARGE OF

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.226
MAKING SURE WE'RE MAKING THE

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.295
RIGHT INVESTMENTS NOT JUST.

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:53.797
MAKING SURE THE ROOF IS FIXED.

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:54.998
SO.

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.133
WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.335
COST FOR ALL THREE FOUR BUT THE

00:48:58.402 --> 00:48:59.703
PRIORITY FOR ALL THIRTY FOUR

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.438
WHAT IS.

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:04.741
THE A PRIORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.143
BASED ON BASED ON YOUR VIEW IN

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:07.577
IRAQ AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:10.747
ASKING. FOR YOU KNOW. FOR YOU TO

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:11.348
AGREE WITH THE POWER LESS I

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:13.016
DON'T HAVE A PART OF THIS I'M

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:14.651
REALLY LOOKING FOR WHAT IS YOUR

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.553
PRIORITY LIST SO THAT WE CAN.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.021
EVALUATE IT BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.856
PRESENTING TO US BECAUSE YOU

00:49:19.923 --> 00:49:21.858
KNOW IF YOU PLAY IF YOU ASKING

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.193
FOR YOU KNOW --

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.262
MONEY TO DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:26.463
FOR TEN FACILITIES BUT THE OTHER

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.632
ONES ARE BIGGER PARTIES OR THAT

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:31.668
BIGGER.

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:32.235
PRICE TAG SO OFTEN.

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.970
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY WE'RE DOING

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:36.306
THIS RIGHT SO BUT WE CAN'T WE

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.342
DON'T HAVE THAT.

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:40.677
SO -- AGAIN

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:41.912
REALLY REALLY --

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.146
HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:44.581
ONGOING.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.982
DISCUSSION I DON'T THINK THIS

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.250
NEEDS TO BE THE END OF THE

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.652
DISCUSSION THIS YEAR I THINK WE

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.953
CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.290
AND TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:54.558
BUT THERE IS SOME OF WHAT.

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.059
THERE'S A LOT OF LOOPHOLES HERE.

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.327
BECAUSE THAT OTHERWISETHEN WE

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.428
MIGHT AS WELL.

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.097
JUST FLIP THE POINT THAT WE CAN

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:03.200
JUST KIND OF RANDOMLY SELECT.

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:04.368
WORK IS FINDING WHAT DOESN'T BUT

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.069
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.037
JUDICIOUS APPROACH [inaudible]

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:08.672
TO FUNDING.

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.240
SO THE EASIER APPROACH WOULD

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.775
JUST BE TO NOT FIND ANY OF IT.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.243
AND TO SAY WELL WHEN YOU'RE

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.779
READY TO PRESENT.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:16.346
THE INFORMATION IN A FASHION

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:19.149
THAT -- YOU

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.817
KNOW IS IS UNDERSTANDABLE THEN

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:21.785
WE COULD.

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:22.719
MOVE FORWARD BUT THESE ARE

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:23.887
FAIRLY THE DECK NOT NONE OF

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.055
THESE ARE SMALL NUMBERS THESE

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:27.457
ARE NOT LIKE FIFTY THOUSAND OR

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:29.226
TEN THOUSAND THESE ARE ALL VERY.

00:50:29.292 --> 00:50:31.328
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:34.798
WITH NOT A LOT OF OVERALL BACK.

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:35.966
I WILL SAY THAT OUR

00:50:36.032 --> 00:50:37.300
DETERIORATION OF OUR PHYSICAL

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.369
PLANT WITHIN OUR PRISONS THE

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.537
CERTAINLY BEEN.

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.239
USE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THOSE

00:50:42.305 --> 00:50:44.541
WHO TRYING TO MANAGE --

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.643
THESE FACILITIES WITH PLASTIC

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.979
BAGS DEFERRED IN WATER TO A

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.547
TRASH CAN.

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:54.451
AND DEALING WITH FIRES THAT FAR.

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:57.521
FAILED AND THE FIRE MARSHAL.

00:50:57.587 --> 00:51:00.357
SHUT US DOWN FROM OPERATING --

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.591
SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH AN

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:03.093
ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON HOW TO

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.828
PREPARE FOOD WHICH COSTS EVEN

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:05.929
MORE MONEY.

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.063
THAN IT WOULD IN A REGULAR

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.132
KITCHEN SO ALL OF IT IT'S IT'S

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.034
VERY VERY COMPLEX AND AND IT

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.502
CERTAINLY --

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.405
NOT LOST ON US OF HOW EXTREME

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:17.441
THE PROBLEM IS --

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:18.542
AND OF COURSE THERE WAS THE

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:20.210
EXPERT HERE AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.912
COST OF ALL OF THAT DEFERRED

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.513
MAINTENANCE BEEN TOTALED UP

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.816
THESE WERE THE PRIORITY FOR THIS

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:29.686
YEAR BASED ON BASED ON WHAT WE

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.188
AND I THINK IT CAME FROM A LIST

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.722
WE DO HAVE LISTS OF BILLIONS

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.989
DOLLARS.

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.357
WORTH OF PROJECTS AS YOU CAN

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:36.226
IMAGINE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.761
DONE.

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.729
THAT'S A LETTER ASKING FOR THEM

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:41.498
NO I I MEAN THAT'S THE MAIN.

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:43.333
I'M NOT ASKING FOR IT YOU KNOW

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.167
THOUSAND LINES STRETCHED OUT

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.102
THOUGH I MEAN I'M I LIKE THAT

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:46.870
THAT MY TRUCK MY COLLEAGUES

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.271
CRAZY -- SO

00:51:48.338 --> 00:51:50.774
WOULD NOT DOTHAT TO THEM BUT I

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:54.044
MEAN.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.379
WHAT I MEAN WHEN YOU DEVELOP

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.281
THESE PRIORITIES HOW HOW DO YOU

00:51:58.348 --> 00:51:59.749
DO AND YOU MUST HAVE A PROCESS

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.051
FOR DOING IT AND?

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.285
SAY HEY DID THIS IS WHAT'S GOING

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:03.954
TO THE TOP AND SO IF THERE'S A

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.322
METHODOLOGY.

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.389
LET US KNOW WHAT IT IS IN A

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.024
WE'RE NOT ME AGAIN WHAT I'M

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:12.696
ASKING YOU. TO I I I BELIEVE I

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.331
THINK YOU WERE ASKING FOR A

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:15.866
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.801
GOT TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:19.436
THEN ALSO WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.470
IT'S FOR AND THAT'S NOT AND

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:21.705
THAT'S MISSING ALL ALL WE'RE

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.340
SAYING IS THE FINAL.

00:52:23.406 --> 00:52:25.108
RESULT I THINK YOU HAVE TO YOU

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.576
HAVE TO SHOW THE COMMITTEE

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.812
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BLACK BOX.

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.847
BECAUSE THEN WE GET TO DETERMINE

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.582
WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT.

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:36.286
DECISION MAKE IT OR NOT.

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.521
SO.

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:38.588

IN THE BUILDING.

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:47.163
THE TO WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.565
AGAIN COME TO SOME SORT OF

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:49.466
RESOLUTION BEFORE.

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:53.570
YOU KNOW BEFORE ME.

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.071

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.445
YOU GET THERE --

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.713
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE I WAS

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.981
DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE FOR THE

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:06.216

CITY BUILDING FROM CITY HALL THE

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:13.223
RE DOWN TO AN OUTHOUSE.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.526
AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:19.896
[inaudible] TO LET ELECTED

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.398

SOMETHING OTHER WE CAN'T SEE OR

00:53:25.001 --> 00:53:26.436
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:27.871
OR WE DON'T MAKE CLEAR TIMES A

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:29.673
LOT OF TIMES I DID MAKE CLEAR

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.074
THE URGENCY.

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.342
OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.278

ROOF.

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.247
WELL.

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.381

WASTING CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:41.451
FLOOR WHICH THEN CAUSES WATER

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:43.653
DAMAGE DUE TO SPEAK SECOND FLOOR

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.721

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.596
SEPARATE BUDGET REQUESTS TO A

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:41.864
REQUEST FOR A ONE TIME INCREASE

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.666
OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:44.967
SPECIAL PAIRS AND DEFERRED

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.102
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.637
ARE FOR PROJECTS AROUND THE

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:49.238
STATE AT OUR FACILITIES.

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:51.240
THE SECOND REQUEST IS EIGHTEEN

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:52.408
POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.877
IN NINETEEN TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:57.313
POINT ONE MILLION IN.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.083
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY FIVE

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:02.351
POINT SIX MILLION ON MAINTENANCE

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:03.319
FUNDING.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.487
AND AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL WERE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.355
ASKING TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:09.525
METHODOLOGY WHICH IS BASED ON A

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:11.761
PER PRISONER BASIS. TWO ONE THAT

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.995
IS BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.564
MAINTENANCE.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.898
AGAIN WE HAVE THE SAME PANELISTS

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.767
FROM THE FIRST ISSUE ON THIS BUT

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.036
WE'LL KEEP IT BRIEF THANK YOU --

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.971
SO AGAIN --

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.673
THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WE

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.708
DEVELOPED FOR THE CAP ALLEY IS

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:26.876
IDENTICAL TO THE DEFERRED

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.944
MAINTENANCE.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.413
EXCEPT THAT IT'S FOCUSES MORE

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.050
ACUTELY ON EXISTING CONDITIONS --

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:36.385
THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED BECAUSE

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.887
OF LACK OF FUNDING ACCENTURE.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:40.556
I'M THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:41.657
TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS EACH

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:43.092
YEAR FOR ITS ADULT FACILITIES

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:44.393
AND TWO MILLION FOR ITS JUVENILE

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.895
FACILITIES TO ADDRESS THESE

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.497
KINDS OF ISSUES --

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:51.033
WE HAVE SEEN A BACKLOG OF OUR

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.102
REPAIR PROJECTS GROW STARTING

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.437
FROM WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.671
MEASURING IN.

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:56.839
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. FOUR

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:57.440
HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.941
DOLLARS TO OVER ONE BILLION

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:02.678
DOLLARS IN SCOPE TO PROJECTS --

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:05.114
AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO WHAT

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.350
WE BELIEVE IS A GREATER BACKLOG

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.784
THAT WE'VE REPORTED RECENTLY IN

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.986
THE MASTER PLAN.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.521
AS MUCH AS THIRTEEN BILLION

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:12.188
DOLLARS.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.257
THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:15.658
IS THAT THE MILLION DOLLARS IS

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:16.993
THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.561
SPENT A LOT OF TIME FOCUSED ON

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.097
GETTING SCOPE AND COST ESTIMATES.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:21.864
I'M AND SO THIS BACKLOG HAS

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:25.334
GROWN AND WHAT WHAT IT AS

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.069
BECAUSE IN THE PRISONS.

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.171
IS -- SORT

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:31.841
OF THIS BREAK FIX RUN TO FAIL --

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.377
ROACH WHERE ARE OUR PRISONS ARE

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:36.379
TRYING TO FIX THE THINGS THAT

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.147
ARE BREAKING THAT DAY AND ARE

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.949
NOT BEING STRATEGIC IN SPENDING

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.450
TIME IN PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:42.885
BECAUSE ARE BEING --

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:45.221
RELOCATED --

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.156
TO THINGS THAT ARE BREAKING DOWN --

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.491
AROUND THEM.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.027
AND I'M CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.695
THAT THE RESOURCES --

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.163
WITHIN THE TWENTY SIX MILLION

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.299
DOLLAR NUMBER TO ADEQUATELY

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:57.400
TRYING TO INTERVENE IN THAT

01:03:57.466 --> 01:04:00.570
BREAK SITE BREAK FIX CYCLE --

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:03.272
AND SO THIS REQUEST IN FRONT OF

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.440
YOU THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.809
DOLLAR QUEST FOR TEN PROJECTS.

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.211
IS -- IN OUR

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.680
MIND SOME OF THE WORST MOST

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.048
IMMEDIATE --

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.316
CONDITIONS THAT THREATEN THE

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:14.450
SAVE.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.052
OUR SECURE AND EFFECTIVE

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:19.789
OPERATION OF THE PRISONS --

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.958
EARLIER JONES SAWYER --

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:24.393
MENTIONED THAT --

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.095
YOU HAVE A ROOF LEAK IT HAS A

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:27.763
COLLATERAL IMPACT AND INDEED IT

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:28.898
DOES AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.600
PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:32.034
OF ROOFS AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.135
FLOORS --

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.338
THAT ARE FAILING AND THE FLOORS

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:35.838
ARE FAMILY BECAUSE WATER

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.173
INTRUSION --

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.109
IT'S CAUSING A GREAT DEAL OF

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.812
CALAMITY AND THE PRISONS --

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.747
IT'S CAUSING US TO HAVE TO SHUT

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.416
DOWN PROGRAM MOVE INMATES --

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.218
FROM HOUSING UNITS FROM MEDICAL

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:51.420
BADS AND SO PART OF THE REQUEST

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.789
HERE IS TO REPLACE SOME ROUGH

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:55.725
SAID A FEW OF OUR FACILITIES --

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.093
AND ALSO TO REPLACE SOME

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.694
FLOORING AT SOME OF THE IMPACTED

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:02.031
AREAS --

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.099
WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS IDENTIFIES?

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.934
SIX LIKE THAT THAT WE FELT WE

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.936
ABSOLUTELY HAD TO GET --

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.871
WORKING ON FOR THE VALUE OF THE

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.373
PRISON.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:12.875
SYSTEM TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY --

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.076
WE ALSO HAVE --

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.479
SOME REGULATORY ISSUES ON IN

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.079
HERE -- WE

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:17.346
HAVE SOME.

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:21.183
OF UPON IMPROVEMENTS AT ONE OF

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.753
OUR PRISONS WE'VE GOT --

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:26.255
A KITCHEN FIRE SUPPRESSION IT'S

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.923
REQUIRED AS PART OF A CODE AND

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.692
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE FIRE

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.327
SUPPRESSION THE KITCHENS --

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.561
THE FARMERS WILL HAVE SHUT DOWN

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.163
THE KITCHEN OPERATIONS AT ONE OF

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.798
OUR FACILITIES AND SO THEY'RE

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.566
TRYING TO MAKE DO WITH US SO

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.068
LIKE KITCHENS.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.603
COOKING SO LIKE KITCHENS.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.272
SO THE IMPACT OF THAT IS --

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:44.974
THE INCREASED COST OF FOOD

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.709
PREPARATION --

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.810
AND THE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.378
PURCHASE FOOD INSTEAD OF LARGE

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.380
QUANTITY SMALLER SYSTEM --

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.449
PRE PACKAGED ITEMS THINGS LIKE

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.984
THAT SO IT HAS SAID IT

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.086
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. TO US WHEN

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.521
THE FIRE MARSHAL COMES IT DOWN

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.956
AND SHUTS DOWN YOU KNOW FIVE OF

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.391
YOUR SATELLITE KITCHENS.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:03.793
AND YOU ONLY HAVE YOUR YOUR MAIN

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:08.397
KITCHEN DO TO PREPARE FOOD AND

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.165
TO RE HEAT AND GET IT.

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:10.366
OVER TO THE FACILITIES FOR

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.101
SERVING YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT AT

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.135
CERTAIN TEMPERATURES SO IT'S

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.037
BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR US

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.339
AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THOSE

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:18.674
ISSUES BUT WE HAVE TO GET THE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:20.309
FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.177
SO WE HAVE FIRE SUPPRESSION

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:25.648
SYSTEM FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS WHICH

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.983
ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT --

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.685
AND THE FACT THAT WITHOUT A

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:31.520
PROPER FIRE ALARM SYSTEM ON A

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:35.124
BUILDING I HAVE TO HAVE STAFF.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.226
AVAILABLE TO ON A WHAT WE CALL

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.729
FIRE WATCH SO WE'RE STILL WE'RE

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.831
PAYING ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR FIRE

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.666
WATCH VERSES IN ALARM SYSTEM WHO

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.901
SHOULD ALERT US. TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.304
RESPOND TO AN AREA SO MULTIPLE

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.238
FISH.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.073
REALLY SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.675
PLANT CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.176
SOME OF THESE BAD SAID --

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:55.578
DOUBLES TALKING ABOUT OUR

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.114
LICENSE MEDICAL BENEFITS.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.783
AND YOU KNOW THE FEAR IS IS YOU

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.284
KNOW IMPACT IN OUR LICENSURE IN

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:03.686
OUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.488
PATIENTS WITHIN THE FACILITY

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:06.922
VERSUS HAVING TO TRANSFER THEM

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.125
OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:09.759
HOSPITALS.

01:07:09.825 --> 01:07:11.761
ANOTHER AREA OF SIGNIFICANT

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:16.065
CONCERN SOME OF THESE ARE ARE.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.199
LARGE YOU KNOW I I KNOW MORE

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.501
ABOUT PHYSICAL PLANT DESIGN THAN

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.503
I CARE TO BECAUSE I'M NOT NOT

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:22.571
THAT GIRL BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:23.873
HAVE A WHOLE.

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:26.041
THIS LARGE IN A PIPE THAT THAT

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.109
IS DOING YOUR HEATING AND

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:29.412
COOLING FOR YOUR INSTITUTION AND

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.313
IT'S YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.482
MANY GALLONS A MINUTE OF WATER

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:34.650
LOSS THAT WE HAVE.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.452
IT IT YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:41.056
IMPACT X. ONE SECTION OF PIPE.

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:42.591
YOU KNOW TEN FEET DOWN THE ROAD

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:43.826
THE PIPE IS BREAKING YET AGAIN

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.261
BECAUSE HE'S GO THROUGHOUT THE

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:46.662
ENTIRE INSTITUTION.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:49.031
THAT UNDER GROUND A PHYSICAL

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:50.299
PLANT THAT IT WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:52.735
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS THAT

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:53.536
IS PROBLEMATIC.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:54.537
AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:55.538
FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.506
APPROPRIATIONS IN YEARS PAST --

01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:59.141
AND MOST PARTICULARLY WITH THE

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.409
REFER PLACEMENTS.

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:01.944
AND IT'S REALLY MY HOPE THAT

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.646
THIS BACKLOG WE START TO SEE IT --

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.281
DIMINISH OVER TIME BECAUSE WE'VE

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.116
HAD THIS INTERSECTION OF PUTTING

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.784
THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND YOU

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.785
KNOW WHEN YOU CAN GET A WATER

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.387
TIGHT ENVELOPE OF A STRUCTURE.

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:13.422
YOU CAN START TO MAKE MEANINGFUL

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:15.090
REPAIRS ON THE INTERIOR BUT IT

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.559
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:17.993
TO PUT --
