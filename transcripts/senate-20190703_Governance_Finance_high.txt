TWELVE FACILITY PROGRAM IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT IS BASED ON A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEVELOPERS. STATE BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN MATCH MY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND LOCAL LOCAL BOND FUNDS AND DEVELOPER FEES TAKEN TO CONSTRUCT NEW SCHOOLS. AND ENHANCE EXISTING SCHOOLS YOUR MODERNIZATION. TOGETHER THESE FUNDS TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS MODERNIZE AGING FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE UPDATED AND SUPPORTED. ANTS I SUPPORT OF A VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND LET ME JUST SAY MISTER CHAIR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. SCHOOL FACILITIES SET THE TONE FOR THE DAY I THINK THEY SPEAK TO A THE STATE'S INTEREST IN EDUCATION AND INVESTMENT. IN EDUCATION SOLDIERS JUMP AHEAD RIGHT HERE AND JUST STAYED A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL -- THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE EQUITY FOR STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BY ENSURING THAT SOME DISTRICTS THAT CAN'T FINANCE SCHOOLS CAN ACTUALLY GET ON A PERCENT. OTHER FACILITIES FINANCED THROUGH HARDSHIP PROGRAM -- WE ALSO HAVE MONEY HERE FOR DISASTER RELIEF -- REMEDIATION AND LEAD AND WATER FOUNTAINS REPLACEMENT A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BUILDINGS PRESCHOOLS AT SCHOOL SITES. AND WE SUPPORT FACILITIES SUCH AS GYMNASIUMS LIBRARIES AND AND AND SCHOOL KITCHENS -- SO WITH THAT I'M JUST GONNA TURN OVER A TODAY WELL WITH ME HERE TODAY IS. BOB YOU FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION A JEFF BECKER. FROM THE PHEASANT FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AGAIN LET ME STATE THERE IS A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS -- FOR IT BUILT INTO THIS THIS THIS APPROACH THAT ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR OWN PROJECTS TO FINANCE THEM. SO THERE IS AGAIN EQUITY BUILT INTO THIS PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT WHICH WILL CONTINUE. BUT THERE IS MISTER CHAIR IF I TURN IT OVER YOU MAY TURN OVER TO THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT MISTER O'DONNELL IS DONE ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. IT IS BEEN A BUSY YEAR TO SAY THE LEAST. IN THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL MEASURE WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS YEAR AND JUST A BIT WILL TURN OVER MISTER BAKI WITH THE CONFERENCE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. SPIKE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES FOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS IS COULD YOU SEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. RESEARCH SAYS THAT ADEQUATE A MODERN FACILITIES ARE ESSENTIAL TO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SIMPLY CANNOT FULFILL THEIR ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IF ATTENTION IS NOT GIVEN TO ENSURE THE FACILITIES ARE CLEAN AND SAFE. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. AND HAVE DONE SO IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE. THIS PARTNERSHIP AS BENEFITTED MORE THAN SIX MILLION STUDENTS AND TALKING WITH HER MEMBERS THERE SIX SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR A. B.. FORTY EIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PASSAGE A LOCAL SCHOOL BONDS REVIEW LOCAL FACILITIES MASTER PLANS. YOU'LL QUICKLY RECOGNISE THE VOLUME WORK THAT STILL OUTSTANDING AS THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THERE IS FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS AUTHORITY WITH OVER FIVE BILLION IN APPLICATIONS ALREADY SUBMITTED. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A NEED TO CONSTRUCT NEW BUILDINGS IN AREAS WHERE THERE STUDENT GROWTH THAT'S NO DOUBT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A NEED TO UPDATE EXISTING SYSTEMS RAKE RECONFIGURE EXISTING FACILITIES TO CREATE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THAT MEET THE SCHOOLS NEXT GENERATION GOALS. OR PROVIDES A SIMPLE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THE LIST GOES ON THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS. THE DEBT SERVICE COSTS TO THE STATE MATCH BY LOCAL FUNDS REFLECT THE APPROPRIATE AND REASONABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF FORTY EIGHT HOW MUCH I TO SEE SB A WE'RE GONNA WELCOME SIR BAKER TO COMMITTEE OF TWO MINUTES SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MORNING CHAIRMAN WHY MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF BACKER I AM THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. FOR THE FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT SCHOOLS I'M ALSO SERVING AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING. WE'RE GONNA BE JUST PULL THAT MIKE LOOK CLOSER I I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING NO PROBLEM. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VOTERS HAVE APPROVED OVER FORTY TWO BILLION IN STATE BONDS TO FUND K. TWELVE SCHOOL FACILITIES LOCAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPERS AND THE STATE ARTNER. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE CLEAN FACILITIES. AB FORTY EIGHT KEEPS THAT THREE LEGGED STOOL INTACT. NOW THAT THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM IS OVER TWENTY YEARS OLD IT IS TIME TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. AB FORTY EIGHT CREATES NEW TOOLS FOR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THOSE WHO ARE FISCALLY DID AS DISADVANTAGED THESE INCLUDE AN UP FRONT RESERVATION A BOND AUTHORITY TO ENSURE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE READY TO REQUEST THEIR CONSTRUCTION FUNDING. AND A NEW GRANT FOR PROJECT AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY AB FORTY EIGHT MAINTAINS THE IMPORTANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP PROGRAM. WHICH HELPS SCHOOLS MEET THEIR LOCAL MATCH WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT LOCAL RESOURCES. REGARDINGTHE USE OF BOND FINANCING WE TYPICALLY SPEND GENERAL FUND TO PAY K. TWELVE SCHOOL BOND DEBT SERVICE. WITH A. B. FORTY EIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS WITHOUT A MEANINGFUL INCREASE TO THAT ANNUAL COST. WELL THEY'RE STILL REMAINING FUND BALANCE FROM PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED BONDS THE CORE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS ARE NOW OVERSUBSCRIBED. WITH ALMOST FOUR AND A HALF BILLION IN PROJECTS AWAITING FINAL PROCESSING AND FINDING AN APPLICATION SUBMITTED TODAY. WOULD REQUIRE PASSAGE OF THE NEW BOND TO BE FUNDED. DISTRICTS HAVE SUBMITTED OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN APPLICATIONS IN ACCESS OF EXISTING BOND AUTHORITY AND THE BACKLOG WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING IN MY OWN BACKYARD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

FOR LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO GIVE SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND WE'RE GONNA SAY GOOD MORNING TO THE VICE CHAIR AND THE TO MISTER NIELSEN. VICE CHAIR. MISTER. I'LL BE THE OPPOSITION THEN. TO HAVE SOMEONE A MESS OF THE PUNCHBOWL -- CINNAMON. O'DONNELL I WILL THIS BE PAID OUT OF NINETY EIGHT IS TH IS THE GENERAL FUND COMES OUT OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND -- THIRTEEN BILLION IN. FIND DENTAL BE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND AND SOMEONE INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT'S GONNA COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND WHERE DOES IT. BUT CHECK COME UP WORDS THAT COME FROM WHAT WE WHAT WE PUSH OUT OF THE WAY. IT'S ALL ABOUT PRIORITIES AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. EDUCATION AND THUS EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU INVEST IN A SCHOOL FACILITY. YOU INVEST IN A CHILD WHEN YOU INVEST IN A CHILD YOU INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. NO ARGUMENTS THERE BUT WE HAVE PROP NINETY EIGHT WHY DO WE JUST PAY IT OUT OF THEIR THIS IS WILL EXPAND. I'M SORRY WE JUST GET OUT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THAT WE'VE GOT 40% OF THE BUDGET DEDICATED TO OUR CHILDREN. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THE GENERAL FUND WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ALMOST TWELVE RECORDS WITH BILLION IN A NEW EXPENSE AYE I WOULD ARGUE THAT. PROP NINETY EIGHT IS ENOUGH THE FINER EDUCATIONAL. SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA FACTORY LOOK [inaudible] ABOUT WHAT. FORTY SIX AND FOR PEOPLE FUNDING SO IF WE WERE TAKE THIS MONEY OUT OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD FURTHER IMPACT ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE. HOW MUCH WE CAN INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS? I DON'T ARGUE THAT AT ALL I THINK I AGREE WITH YOU THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS NOT SUFFICIENT QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. AND HOW BIG THEIR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICITS ARE IT'S SCARY. TENSIONS IN THE RETIREE MEDICAL JUST KILLING HER OUR DISTRICTS -- BUT I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND MONEY TO REDUCE THOSE THAT SO THEY CAN HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR BUDGETS AND LOWER THEIR ANNUAL. SO IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE STAFF REPORTED IT SHOWS THE TEN LARGEST STATES AND IT SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA. IS IN THE THREE BOTTOM WHEN IT COMES. TO THE THE AMOUNT OF THAT PERSONAL INCOME THE DEBT PER CAPITA AND THE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF STATE GDP WEEK WE ARE WORK. ALREADY GOT SO MUCH. THAT COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN. AND WE HAVE AS A STATE WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT TALK. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL. STRUCTURE OF THE STATE AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I'M JUST YOU KNOW SPEAKING AS JUST. ONE PERSON THAT KIND OF BOOK DONE FINANCES. I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PAY FOR HOW. TO HOW DO WE MAKE IT ALL FIT AND SO. BECAUSE OF THAT. SYMON O'DONNELL AYE I'M GONNA BE A NO VOTE AND IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'M SAYING NO TO JUST ABOUT EVERY. BONDAGE I THINK THAT'S IT I'VE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH YOU HAVE. I AND I'M. NO AND I HAVE A TEACHER THAT'S A SCHOOL TEACHER. YOU KNOW ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. I'LL BUT I'M JUST SAYING I GOT A WERE. FOR ME SIR YOU WERE MY BROTHER OKAY BROTHERS -- IS HE LISTENING RIGHT NOW. I GET TO HEAR FROM HIM. WE DO HAVE FAMILY EVENTS. AND THE AND SO BUT BUT BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE WHOLE AND IN IN THIS IS NOT THE ONLY BOND MEASURE THAT'S COME BEFORE US SO THEY ALL PASS. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO IT. AND WE'RE READY HIGHS TAX STATE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT. WHAT WE DO SO LIKE YOU SAID IT'S ALL ABOUT PRIORITIES AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO START? PRIORITIZING AND ONE OF THOSE IS TO REDUCE OUR DATA THAT WOULD BE THE PENSIN PLAN. AND RETIREE MEDICAL LA UNIFIED WAS HERE. THEY JUST HAD TO PUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET. IN RETIREE MEDICAL THAT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES MISTER THAT. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE FORMING. HEARINGS AND AND LOOKING AT HOW DO WE HELP THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL. ACTUATION IS AWFUL OAKLAND SACRAMENTO CITY EGGMAN CITIES WAS ABOUT A MONEY IN NOVEMBER. IN INDIA AND SO HOW DO WE CONVINCE VOTERS THAT WE GOT A HELP THE STUDENTS WERE BUSY BUILDING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A DISCONNECT. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME. DOWN ON MY SOAPBOX MR DONALD SAILOR TO THE WIFE. THANK YOU SAID. I I JUST ARE YOU LISTEN IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T -- IF YOU CAN'T BUILD A SCHOOL YOU CAN'T EDUCATED STUDENT. AND I THINK THIS BOND EFFORTS SPEAKS AGAIN TO OUR STATES PRIORITIES COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND I THINK BUT I KNOW BOND FINANCING ISIN SO LONG. ACCEPTED METHOD. OF FINANCING OUR SOCIAL OVERHEAD CAPITAL IF YOU WILL ITS USE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AS WELL. AND HISTORICALLY INTEREST RATES ARE RELATIVELY CHEAP RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THIS IS WHERE. WE SHOULD GO WE SHOULD WE SHOULD TAKE OUR CASH AND PAID ON A LONGER TERM RETIREE DEBT SUPPORTER PENSIONERS I THINK YOU'RE ONE RIGHT WE WANNA KEEP PROPAGATION TO THOSE FOLKS. BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND YOU AND YOUR APPRECIATION FOR BEING FISCALLY PRUDENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE VICE CHAIR. WE'RE GONNA CENTER NIELSEN. GOOD MORNING. WE CAPITAL OUTLAY. CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN A SEPARATE BOND ISSUE FOR DECADES. AS ALLOCATED TO THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD WITH THE HELP OR SOMETIMES I WOULD CALL IT THE INTERFERENCE. OF THE STATE ARCHITECT. THEY HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN A BIT OF A PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE THEY ARE NOW BUT I SERVE MANY YEARS ON THAT. ALEX. AND THAT WAS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE REHABILITATION. AND SO CONSTRUCTION. NOW WE'RE ADDING A FEW. ITEMS TO THAT LIST THAT THEY CONSIDER. DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE ALLOCATION BOARD HAS UPDATED ITS REGULATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE THESE NEW DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED. YES I I I CAN ANSWER THAT SO THE THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND IN. AS FAR AS PROVIDING BANDWIDTH IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THERE ARE TEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. TO THE OFFICE PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION THAT OVERSEES A STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. THE REASON BEING IS THAT THERE WERE SOME DELAYS IN PROCESSING OF BOND PROJECTS COMING THROUGH THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. AND WE JUST MOVED ON THAT -- AND DO BELIEVE THAT IS CAN ASSIST -- IN THE BACKLOG. OF A PROJECTS TO BE A TO MOVE THEM OUT QUICKER WHICH IS GOOD NEWS IN THEIR NIELSEN HAD ME ON THE HEAD WE GOTTA GET THIS MONEY OUT ON THE STREET QUICKER. OUR KIDS DEPEND ON IT IN% ADDITIONAL MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED PLEASE THE SERVER MAY I SIT ON STATE ALLOCATION BOARD -- AND WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU AS WE THEY AREN'T THEY HAVEN'T CONTEMPLATED A DOG ADOPTING REGULATIONS FOR LAW THAT DOES NOT YET EXIST. SO HOULD THIS PASS I'M SURE THE THE THE THE STATE EDUCATION FOURTEEN WOULD GO TO WORK IMMEDIATELY AND AND CONTEMPLATING BRING FORWARD TO THE BOARD. SOME REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH THE NEW LAW. BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE STATE ARCHITECT -- I THINK I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK. WITH THEM WITH THAT OFFICE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE WHAT I IMMEDIATELY HEARD -- WHEN I GOT HERE AND STARTED TALKING TO THE SCHOOL FACILITY FOLKS WAS THERE WERE A LOT OF HURDLES PUT UP BY THE STATE ARCHITECTS OFFICE AND WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THINGS ARE GETTING MUCH? BETTER OVER THERE AND MUCH MORE FRIENDLY AND A MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUS PROCESS HAS BEEN A SALAS GET PROJECTS THROUGH. THE STATE ARCHITECTS OFFICE THEY'VE BEEN RATHER RESPONSIBLE LAST FEW YEARS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE DO WE NEED TO DO MORE. ABSOLUTELY BUT WE HAVE A GOOD START [inaudible] GOOD [inaudible] WELL. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL SUPPORT. NO SMALL MEASURE BECAUSE MY LONG HISTORY WITH THAT AND THE NEEDS. WE DO HAVE SOME DECLINING ENROLLMENT. TO SCHOOLS AROUND CALIFORNIA TO THAT'S A NEW PHENOMENA WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT THAT IS SIMPLY TAKE SOME OF THE IMPACT OFF THE DEMANDS ON THE BOND. AND I SUPPOSE I'M NOT TOO CONCERNED ABOUT EXPANDING THE DIFFERENT THINGS ARE GOING -- BUT MONEY INTO THROUGH THE ALLOCATION BOARD AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE ALLOCATION PROCESS. THAT IT GENERALLY HAS BEEN A PROCESS IMBUED WITH INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENCE AND PEOPLE TRUSTED. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HAS DIMINISHED AT ALL HAS IT YOU WHO ARE IN THE FIELD DEALING WITH IT ALL THE TIME DELEGATION BOARD. WELL I'LL BE SUPPORT THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE NIELSEN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND FOR ALLOF YOUR WORK AS WELL AS A PREVIOUS MEMBER AS HE ALLOCATION BOARD. I'M SURE DONALD JUST VERY QUICKLY ON ON ISSUES OF SOME COMMENTS AND HOW THEY RELATE. K. TWELVE BUT THEN ALSO ON BONDS. I THINK THE IMPORTANT PIECES THAT MR O'DONNELL NAY ON THE HEAD REGARD TO PROP. NINETY EIGHT WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES. IN PER PUPIL SPENDING OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER STUDENT. COMPARED TO EIGHT YEARS AGO. AND AS MISTER O'DONNELL HAD ALREADY MENTIONED WE ARE WELL BEHIND THE PACK WHEN IT COMES A PER PUPIL SPENDING HERE IN AMERICA. IF WE WERE TO TAKE [inaudible] BOND PAYMENT [inaudible] FINANCING. OUT FROM POT NINETY EIGHT OUT PRESS FURTHER BEHIND. WE TAKE A LOOK AT PENSIONS. AT THIS LEGISLATURE'S ADVANCING. A THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DOWN PAYMENT ON THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. OUR SYSTEM. THIS YEAR. WE PUT SIX BILLION DOWN LAST YEAR THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM [inaudible] EVERY TEACHER. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE IN THE STATE ARE PAYING MORE. THEN THEY HAVE TEN YEARS AGO. IN WHAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT. IS HAVING TO ADVANCE ENHANCE FUNDING. FOR BOTH THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IN FACT THAT IS CREATED TENSION. BECAUSE THE DISTRICTS ARE ADVANCING [inaudible] ENHANCE FUNDING. WHICH THEN MEANS. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ALLOCATED ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR HAVING PUT MORE TOWARDS PENSIONS. AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU MY POINT OF VIEW. THIRTY GOOD YEARS UNDER PAYMENTS. AND NOW WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP -- THERE'S THREE WAYS WE CAN PAY DOWN THIS DEBT. IN THE STATE IS ADVANCING ADVANCES ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO PAY DOWN STATE TEACHER RETIREMENT SYSTEM DEBT. THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN THE BUDGET. TWO INDIVIDUALS. HAVE ENHANCED PAYMENTS THAT'S HAPPENING EVEN AS WE SPEAK. IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALSO ADVANCING ENHANCE PAYMENTS INTO THE STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. AND THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF BONDS. THE THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE LEFT. IN THE PREVIOUS BOND IS OVER PRESCRIBED. ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. I WILL SHARE WITH YOU SEEN THE POSITIVE IMPACTS IN SOME OF THE MOST RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE -- LIFE CHANGING. WE HAVE ENTIRE SCHOOLS IN TRINITY COUNTY [inaudible] THAT HAVE. WHERE KIDS CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL IN BECAUSE OF MOLD? IT HAD TO PUT PORTABLES ON TO THE PLANE FIELDS. AND STUDENTS ARE NOW NO LONGER ALLOWED IN THE MAIN BUILDING. UNACCEPTABLE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE KIDS THAT ARE UNABLE TO GO INTO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF SUCH SIGNIFICANT MOLD CHALLENGES. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BOND.

COUNCIL MEMBERS ACCOUNTS MEMBERS MAYOR I WILL START BY SAYING WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AB USE EIGHTY YEARS AND WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN COMMITTED MISSISSIPPI THE ONES RELATED A FIRE SAFETY WE HAVE TWO REMAINING ISSUES FOR MY CLIENTS ONE IS THE OWNER OCCUPANCY THEY FEEL LITTLE. DEGRADE THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITIES IF YOU DON'T THEY LIKE TO REQUIRE AND ROCK CONSIDER THESE UNITS. THE SECOND ONE IS A PARKING AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT ONCE BUT CONSORTIUM PARKING EVEN THOSE THIS BILL IS RESTRICTED TE PARKING REQUIREMENTS DOWN TO WITHIN A HALF MILE OF TRANSIT IN A COUPLE OF OTHER VERY SPECIFIC INSTANCES. THE ISSUE THAT'S COMING UP FOR US IS THAT I'M VERY NARROW STREETS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT FIRE TRUCKS ANOTHER FIRE SAFETY AND OTHER EMERGENCY VEHICLES BEING ABLE TO GET DOWN THOSE STREETS. AND IF WE CANNOT REQUIRE ONSITE PARKING A RESTRICTED ON THAT WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ISSUE IN OUR INABILITY. IN THOSE VERY SPECIFIC CASES ON A MINISTER REALLY APPROVED PERMIT TO BE ABLE TO SAY. LISTEN THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE EVEN WITH SET BACKS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THE FIRE TRUCKS NO THE THINGS DOWN BALLOT WROTE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED BUT WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORDS YOU CAN HAVE YEAH HANG THERE IF THAT'S OKAY. I JUST IN CASE OR ANY QUESTIONS. THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA WELCOME ANYONE OUT TO MAY BE OF HOMES IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION. THIS IS GONNA BE LAST CALL. GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE YOU SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YES WELCOME MOTION AYE SOME VERY BRIEF COMMENTS WOULD LIKE THERE TO SEE. WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS PLEASE MADAM SENATOR FORESHORES. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RT OPPOSITION. LOOK I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS AND HAVE THE SOME MEMBER CLOSE ON THIS. IS THAT OUT WHILE EIGHTY USE AREN'T THE SILVER BULLET. THEY ARE IMPORTANT PART OF SOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS. ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK THAT THERE ARE. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE. IN THE BUILD OUT OF EIGHTY USE. EACH OF THE THREE BILLS ARE MOVING FORWARD WOULD ASSIST COMMUNITIES IN THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT PARKING -- WHAT I A HAVE SEEN AT LEAST? A NEIGHBOR THAT I LIVE IN. A IN A SMALL COMMUNITY ON THERE HAVE NOT BEEN THE CHALLENGES. AND THE WORST FEARS HAVE NOT BEEN LIVED OUT. IN UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'RE REMAIN CONCERNED. BUT WILL TURN IT OVER. TO THE AD SOME MEMBER FOR CLOSING COMMENTS AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. I DO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU. CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT IS ONE OF THE MOST -- IF NOT THE MOST ONEROUS CHALLENGES TO BUILDING EIGHTY YEARS AND MANY OF THE CITY'S -- THAT RICK CHOIR OWNER OCCUPANCY AROUND THE STATE. OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT -- THAT REQUIREMENT DETERS BANKS FROM LENDING FOR RADIO CONSTRUCTION AND COULD RESULT IN A ACTUALLY AND UNITS BEING DESTROYED. A CITIES AROUND THE STATE THAT DO NOT REQUIRE OWNER OCCUPANCY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE ISSUES THAT ARE OUTLINED. BY THE OPPOSITION HOWEVER -- IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE ADDED A FIVE YEAR SUNSET -- TO THE BILL EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOR A OF MONITORING. WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO SEE IF IT BECOMES A PROBLEM? ON THE ISSUE OF PARKING -- FRANKLY ACT I SIMPLY DON'T GET THE ISSUE. OF I I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS BUT IF THERE'S NO PARKING ON THE STREET IS NO PARKING ON THE STREET. AN ADDITIONAL CARS PARKING ARE I MEAN IF THERE WERE TO BE DOUBLE PARKING THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM IN ANY COMMUNITY WHERE THERE ARE -- THERE'S HEAVY USE OF THE RETIRED PARKING. AND THE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE I LIVE IN SANTA MONICA. WE HAVE SANTA MONICA COLLEGE VERY CLOSE BY [inaudible] PEOPLE. PARK ON THE STREETS IN THIS AND THE SPACES YET BILLS. WELL PLEASE THAT WAS THE CASE BEFORE PREFERENTIAL PARKING. BUT THAT WAS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES THAT WAS A PARKING ISSUE FOR RESIDENTS. IN THE CASE OF EIGHTY IS THE HOUSING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IT'S ALL GOING TO BE NEAR TRANSIT THAT'S GOING TO BE A BACKUP SYSTEM. OFFER PEOPLE AND THAT OF THESE CARS AND FRANKLY WE REALLYNEED TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE TO UTILIZE PUBLIC TRANSIT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO VEHICLES. THIS WILL HELP ACCOMPLISH THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WOMEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE ALSO THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE. ANY ISSUES RELATED PARKING AS WELL SO JUST WANNA CLEAR WITH THAT.

A SUICIDE I'M SORRY MANY OF THESE WERE ACTUALLY YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE SITE IS A SECOND AND THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG. CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. MORE SUICIDE PREVENTION AND CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE NEEDED FOR AT RISK POPULATIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE IN RURAL LOCATIONS. THIS SITE IS THE MOST PURPOSE LET IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE. WHERE THERE ARE FEWER CENTERS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE? AB NINE EIGHTY FOUR DRESSES THIS ISSUE BY CREATING A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION. SO THE RESOURCES CAN BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME -- DOCTOR WECHT DIRECTOR OF THE SUICIDE PREVENTION A CRISIS SERVICES WELL SPACE HEALTH IN SACRAMENTO.

AND YOU'VE HEARD THE STATISTICS PARTICULAR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. I'M TOO MANY OF OUR FOLKS SEE THIS AS AN OPTION MANY OF OUR FOLKS STRUGGLED TO GET ACCESS TO CARE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE THE PROBLEM IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. TAX CHECK OFF AS YOU KNOW OUR VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE AS A STRATEGY THAT THE STATE HAS USED MANY MANY TIMES I WAS STAFF TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND STAFF THESE BILLS -- THIS IS A VERY WELL RECOGNIZE STRATEGY -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THIS AS AN OPTION TO PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE SO WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THOSE NUMBERS AND SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO SERVE.

MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS REALLY TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH AB. NINE EIGHTY FOUR VOLUNTARY TAX CONTRIBUTION FRIEND. I'M DOCTOR WITH A DIRECTORS SUSAN PREVENTION AWHILE SPACE HOW. BEEN DOING THIS. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I'M ALSO A SURVIVOR OF SUICIDE LAS. AN ACCOUNTANT EXPERT ON SUICIDE. THE RESEARCH DOES SHOW THAT ACCREDITED CRISIS CENTER SUCH AS OURS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND OTHERS LIKE THE HEARST A LOS ANGELES. AND WE HAVE A NETWORK OF ELEVEN CRISIS CENTERS THAT ARE SIMILAR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT THOSE CRISIS CENTERS PROVIDE EFFECTIVE LIFESAVING BLANKET OF CARE FOR THOSE IN MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR WHO IS SUICIDAL. I AM WE HAVE HIGH STANDARDS OF CARE WERE NATIONALLY ACCREDITED IS UUALLY IS A CERTIFIED THROUGH THE NATIONAL LIFELINE. I WOULD PROVIDE RISK ASSESSMENT CRISIS INTERVENTION EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SAFETY PLANNING AND EVEN FOLLOW UP. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AT HIGH RISK OR IN THE MIDST OF ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. CRISIS CENTERS ARE REALLY VITAL COMPONENTS OF CALIFORNIA'S BEAVER HEALTH SYSTEM OFTEN WORKING WITH THE YOUTH AND ADULTS -- WHO HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN? NO ONE ELSE TO HELP THEM WORK THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE OFTENTIMES FOR FOLKS WERE SUICIDAL. AND WE'RE ALSO THE PERFECT FIRST STEP IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM A BRIDGE OVER THE GAP IN SERVICES THAT EXCESS STATEWIDE. I'M EN INTO THE SAFETY AND THE CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND WE LINK FOLKS TO COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES THAT ARE MUCH NEEDED. WE ALSO DIVERT. OUR COLORS FROM OVER BURDENS RESOURCES LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT. NINE ONE ONE AND FIRST RESPONDERS. WHO ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH TO DO AND DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE INVOLVED AND ARE ALWAYS IN IS NOT ALWAYS HELPFUL -- CUT CALIFORNIA CRISIS CENTERS EXPIRING Là. EXPERIENCING A LARGE INCREASES IN CALL VOLUME. 62% AND HIGHER. I'M JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THEY'RE OFTEN UNDER FUNDED. LET ME SAY WE COULD NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH SUICIDE PREVENTION SUPPORT. STATEWIDE ONGOING SUPPORT OF THIS NATURE HELPS CRISIS CENTERS AND DONORS. TO BE MORE ABLE TO HELP PREVENT IN SUICIDE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS FUNDING WOULD ENABLE US TO DO MORE. AND TO REACH MORE. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF SUICIDE ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WRECKED. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY BUSINESSES EXPRESS SPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS LAW THAT THIS LAW EVEN EXIST AND I'LL GET EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS. I AM HAVE A BUSINESS THAT DESIGN CENTURY FROM THE CLOTHING FOR LITTLE GIRLS. I WOULD DO LITTLE BOYS CLOTHING AS WELL BUT THEY'RE NOT AS FUN TO STOP. SO I ONLY THE LITTLE GIRL CLOSING BUT SHOULD I HAVE DONE BOTH I PROBABLY NOT KNOWING ABOUT THE SLOW MAY HAVE CHARGE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR GIRLS AND BOYS CLOTHES BECAUSE BOYS HAVE LOWER MARKET PRICE POINT THAN GIRLS. OUR LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THAT. AND I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT IS A SMALL BUSINESS. SO THIS IS WHY THIS IS PERSONALLY AT IMPORTANT BILL TO ME AND BY REQUIRING CERTIFICATION OF ABOUT THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT. AT THE TIME OF THE TREATING THE LICENSE. AB SIXTY AS A MEMBER WE INCREASE BUSINESSES AWARENESS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAW AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PREVENT VERY VERY COSTLY FEES. THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE JENNER TAX REPEAL ACT WHICH COULD REALLY DEVASTATE A SMALL BUSINESS ESPECIALLY ONE JUST STARTING OUT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY IN WITH ME I HAVE LEYVA SILVERTHORNE FROM THE CAL CHAMBER THE SPONSOR OF THE SPELL. SB CAN SUPPORT. THE MORNING MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS SALINAS OVER THERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AB. SIXTEEN OH SEVEN THIS BILL CURRENTLY AFTER AMENDMENTS REQUIRES THAT LOCAL LOCALITIES ISSUING PERMITS ISSUED NOTICES OF THE DINNER TAX REPEAL ACT IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL CONSIDERING OUR DIVERSE BUSINESS CLIMATE IN CALIFORNIA -- IT ALSO. DEALS WITH ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP RECENTLY AS POINTED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES. BUSINESSES WERE RECENTLY TARGETED BECAUSE OF THEIR PERCEIVED NATIONALITY OR RACE OR ETHNICITY FORM UNFAIR AND FRIVOLOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THERE WAS IT IF YOU INSTANCES OF SOME ATTORNEYS TARGETING THESE BUSINESSES. BECAUSE OF THE GENDER TAX PRICING ISSUE SO THIS BILL REQUIRING MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND PROVIDING ADVANCE NOTICE TO THE ADVANCE NOTICE. TO BUSINESSES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE GENDER TAX REPEAL. WILL HELP BUSINESSES COMPLY AND PREVENT THAT NEED LISTEN FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SUBMIT LETTERS OF SUPPORT IN TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE ON ANALYSIS THIS BILL IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THIRTEEN LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES IN THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. SO FOR THESE REASONS OTHERS WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSORED SUPPORT AB.

THIS KIND OF STUFF AS WELL AS WE HAVE IT IS -- ADEQUATE LEGISLATION TO STOP THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR AND WE WE WE WE YOU HAD A SAMPLE OF A CASE. IN A REPORT INTO. TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT I'M JUST WONDERING. IT WOULD ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE DONE THAT. STOP THE NONSENSE I THINK FOR FOR A FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HELPING BUSINESSES COMPLY FROM THE OUTSET. IS MUCH MORE OF PACKED FULL OF THAT BECAUSE THEN BUSINESSES WON'T BE TARGETED WITH THESE LAWSUIT -- I THINK LAKE AND SPEAK TO THE WATER THERE'S NO CURRENT BILL PENDING TO DEAL WITH THE SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT AS FAR AS THE LAWYERS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THAT PARTICULAR THEY WERE AGAIN HOLD THE FOR THE COURT THEY WERE CHARGED WITH EXTORTION. AND DIFFERENT CAUSES OF ACTION SO WE ARE THE STATE HAS BEEN PURSUING THESE -- BAD ACTORS BUT AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTS OUT THAT WAY TO PREVENT THIS IS TO ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES TO HAVE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION SO THAT THEY KNOW TO PRICE THEIR GOODS APPROPRIATELY SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE TARGETED UNFAIRLY.

WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE THE DYNAMIC DUO HERE WITH US WE HAVE THE SAME NUMBER CHU IS WELL SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO. THIS ISSUE IS FOCUS ON PUBLIC BANGS THIS IS AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN SOME NUMBER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMONS I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT IN PARTICULAR TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN. AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR DEEP ENGAGEMENT WITH MY OFFICE AND OUR COALITION. PARTICULARLY ON AN ISSUE THAT WE COMMITTED TO RESOLVE IN SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT OF BALLOT BOX APPROVAL FOR VOTERS FOR GENERAL LOST CITIES INCLUDING THOSE CITIES THAT ALSO ENTER INTO A GPA. BUT DOING THAT WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF CHARTER CITIES TO GOVERN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS. AT THIS MOMENT THE LARGEST BANKS IN AMERICA ON WALL STREET HOLD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FUNDING THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE LOCAL CONTROL OVER TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR AND THIS BILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH A PUBLIC BANK IT SIMPLY ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHARTER A PUBLIC BANK. WHICH WOULD BE A LONG MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH MANY REGULATORY HURDLES. WE CRAFTED A BILL TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC BANKING ASSETS ARE PROPERLY SAFEGUARDED. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL REQUIREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LAW AND BANKING LAW WITH REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS. ARE BILL REQUIRES A PUBLIC BANKS KEEP THE SAME COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AS PRIVATE BANKS TO MAIN. MAINTAIN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE TO CONDUCT FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND TO PROVE BUSINESS PLANS THAT ANALYZE COSTS. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND LEGALITY WHEN APPLYING FOR A OUR BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE OF A CERTAIN SIZE BEFORE APPLYING FOR BANKING CHARTER. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND REQUIRE COUNTIES UNDER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS TO FORM A GPA. WE ALSO CRAFTED A BILL TO SUPPORT LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THE BILL SPECIFICALLY ENCOURAGES PUBLIC BANKS WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO pINSTITUTIONS CREDIT UNIONS COMMUNITY BANKS ETCETERA. TO CONDUCT RETAIL SERVICES WITH THOSE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS THIS IS MODELED AFTER THE PUBLIC BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. WHICH HAS SUCCESSFULLY PARTNERED WITH THOSE SORTS OF INSTITUTIONS OF FOR PROFIT RETURNS FOR MANY YEARS SO WITH THAT. ELECTED. TRULY BEEN A JOINT AUTHOR AND EVERY -- IN EVERY MEANING OF THAT TERM MR SANTIAGO. THANK YOU SO MUCH I MISS HIM AND I APOLOGIZE AND HAVE TO GO VOTE IN EDUCATION I'LL BE RIGHT BACK BUT BEFORE I DO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH. TEN OVER TO AS WELL AS A MEMBER SANTIAGO FOR THEIR ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE. FOR THEIR WORK IN THEIR DEEP ENGAGEMENT WE ARE TRULY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS I IN THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR AND AGAIN WE'RE ALWAYS GRATEFUL TO WORK WTH YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HIM PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO UNDERSTAND IT IS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. I IN MY OWN WORDS NOT YOURS I I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING A CHAMPION OF PUSHING NEW PER AUGUSTA BOLD IDEAS -- PARTICULARLY ONE LIKE THIS AND FOR HELPING US TO CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHARTER SEE BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND GENERAL LAW CITY WOULD BE THE ONE THAT WOULD. ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE BALLOT MEASURE IT AND IF THERE'S ANY REQUIRED -- CLARIFYING LANGUAGE I'M I'M SURE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON THAT PIECE IN -- BUT ONE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LET ME JUST SORT OF I THINK THIS IS FAIR IS POLICY PROPOSAL. I KNOW THE VERY MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED BUT LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IT'S GOT TO BE FDIC INSURED. I EIGHTY REQUIRES A RIGOROUS -- FEASIBILITY STUDY ARE YOU STILL HAVE TO GO THE DEPARTMENT TO DO YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A A PUBLIC BANK. I THINK WE'LL KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THE OLD WAY OF BANKING IS NOT WORKING. I AM ONE ALLOW MONTHS POLITIES TO SET UP A PUBLIC BANK FOR A PUBLIC GOOD IT'S VERY BASIC CONCEPT IT'S A NEW CONCEPT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A PUBLIC BANG FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. FOR OUR DOLLARS ARE A COULD BE INVESTED AYE TOWARDS DOING. A GOOD OUR COMMUNITIES AS OPPOSED -- TO AS AS OPPOSED -- TO HELPING WALL STREET THANK YOU. TO THE COMMITTEE A STAFF -- MISTER CHAIR IN THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED HOW AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EYE BUT WHEN THAT TIME COMES THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. FOR MORE LIKE MEMBERS MIKE MONEGAN ON BEHALF OF MAYOR BREED AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT. HI THE END OF US BECAUSE WITH HELP FOM TO TO JUSTICE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. REALLY JORDAN WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SUPPORT. TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. I'M NANCY PRICE A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE I'M ALSO. A CO CHAIR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR DEMOCRACY AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATION AND ON THE BOARD OF THE WOMEN'S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM U. S. SECTION. THAT HAVE LARGE MEMBERSHIP IN THE STATE. AND WE ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MITCH SNIDER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. YOUR MEMBERS MORE TALK ON THE HAVE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SO OUR OUR WITNESSES DIDN'T PRESENT BEFORE THE OTHER SO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IF THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER BASHIR DOCTOR CHAU WHO TRUE YOU BET. THANK YOU -- TWO MINUTES EACH AND IN OUR COMMITTEE. OF THANK YOU OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR ARE BILL AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLYMEMBERS JUNE SANTIAGO FOR AUTHORING THIS THIS BILL TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN FINANCES. HI MY NAME IS SYLVIA CHI AND I AM A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE. OUR ALLIANCE REPRESENTS EVERYDAY PEOPLE FROM TEN CITIES AND REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE FROM EUREKA TO SAN DIEGO. IN ADDITION WE ARE PROUD TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING COMMUNITIES ORGANIZED LABOR. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ADVOCATES IN THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN HAS ALSO BEEN ENDORSED BY THREE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST CITIES LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND AS WELL AS RICHMOND SAN DIEGO SANTA CRUZ. LONG BEACH HUNTINGTON PARK BERKELEY EUREKA IN WATSONVILLE AS WELL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. AFTER THIS LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS OUR COMMUNITY IS CLEAR NEED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE WALL STREET MEGA BANKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY THE PRIMARY PROVIDERS OF DEPOSITORY SERVICES. FOR CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES. OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE PASSED RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX AND AGAINST THE WALL STREET FINANCE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. AND OTHER NEW FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ADOPTED SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ORDINANCES AGAINST CONTRACTING WITH COMPANIES THAT DO NOT PAY THEIR WORKERS A LIVING WAGE. OR STEAL FROM THEIR WORKERS. GET CITIES KEEP HAVING TO WAIVE THESE POLICIES AND LAWS TO AWARD LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS TO THESE BANKS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER OPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN JOSE'S CONTRACT FOR BANKING SERVICES WAS UP FOR RENEWAL IN MARCH. ALL OF THE BANKS BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THEIR DEPOSITS WERE NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE CITY'S POLICY AGAINST WORKING WITH COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE WHICH THAT VIOLATIONS. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE WINNING BID WENT TO CHASE WHICHHAD INCURRED A RECORD OF OVER TWENTY WAIT AN HOUR VIOLATIONS. INCURRING OVER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES. LIKEWISE LAST EAR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO EXTEND HIS CONTRACT WITH WELLS FARGO. DESPITE ITS UNSATISFACTORY NEEDS TO IMPROVE RATING ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR IT DISCRIMINATORY IN A LEGAL CREDIT PRACTICES RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT HARM TO CONSUMERS. IN MY CITY OF OAKLAND OR CITY COUNCIL HAD TO WAIVE OUR LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE IN ORDER TO CONTRACT WITH THE UNION BANK. OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED A WAY TO BANK OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT IS SAFE AND DOES NOT ACTIVELY BREAK THE LAW AND HARM OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. OUR COMMUNITIES ALSO NEED INVESTMENTS THAT CENTERS COMMUNITIES NOT PROFITS. I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE CRISIS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS WREAKING HAVOC ACROSS THE STATE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP. IN LOS ANGELES ORANGE RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES THERE'S A SHORTFALL OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS. AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME RENTERS. AND THAT NUMBER IS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION UNITS FOR THE WHOLE STATE. BANKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS CAN HELP MEET THAT UNMET NEED. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN CREATES A FRAMEWORK SO THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN APPLY TO THE STATE BANKING REGULATOR THE DPO FOR LICENSED ESTABLISH THEIR OWN BANK. UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST FIRST CONDUCTS AND VOTE TO APPROVE A STUDY ADDRESSING THE VIABILITY AND GOVERNANCE OF THE PUBLIC BANK. IN SOME CASES VOTERS MUST ALSO VOTE ON THE STUDY. BEFORE THEY EVEN SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO THE GPO THE PROFESSIONALS AT DPO FDIC AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL THOROUGHLY SCRUTINIZED EACH. EACH SUCH APPLICATION A SPECIAL CONCERN FOR POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AND WILL CONTINUE TO OVERSEE AND REGULATE ANY APPROVED BANK. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE COLLATERAL NATION REQUIREMENTS OR COUNTY TREASURER TO DO SHE OR YOU DO YOU SHOULD MAKE PRUDENT INVESTMENTS. PUBLIC DOLLARS WILL BE SAFE AND PUBLIC BANKS TO DO THE STRONG SAFEGUARDS APPLICABLES TO ALL BANKS HOLDING PUBLIC DEPOSITS. AND THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS BUILT INTO THIS BILL. PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA NEED A WAY TO RESPONSIBLY BANK AN INVESTOR PUBLIC DOLLARS. AN EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN IS THE COMMON SENSE SOLUTION WE NEED THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING YOUR BILL AND WE URGE YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU SENATORS THANK YOU COMMITTING THANK YOU. TO THE BILL'S SPONSORS OF MY NAME'S CHRIS PADLOCK -- I'M HERE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA BANKING ALLIANCE AND FRIENDS OF PUBLIC BANKING IN SANTA ROSA. I'M A CERTIFIED GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICER WITH OVER TWENTY YEARS SERVING AS A FINANCE MANAGER FOR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES -- CURRENTLY THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR VALLEY THEM IN WATER DISTRICT. OVER IN THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF CINEMA -- I LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT SERVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FEEL PRESSURE TO MAXIMISE UTILITY OF PUBLIC FUNDS. WE SIT IN PUBLIC MEETINGS WHERE WE FEEL THE PRESSURE TO KEEP TAXES AND RATES LOW ALL AT THE SAME TIME KEEPING THE SERVICES THE COMMUNITY EXPECTS. ROADS PAVED WATER FLOWING AND ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPLY WITH THE VARIOUS -- RECORD -- INVESTMENT POLICIES FOR PUBLIC FUNDS -- DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRESTORM OUR DISTRICT WAS HEAVILY AFFECTED BY THE FIRES -- WE ALSO. LEARNED THAT WE ALL HAD A LOT OF ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- WORK TO DO AS A RESULT OF THE THE PRESSURES FROM THAT FIRE STORM -- WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS -- AND AS A PUBLIC FINANCE OFFICER WHEN I GO OUT AND LOOK AT PROJECTING THOSE PROJECTS UNDER FINANCING THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE EFFECT IS DONE BASICALLY DOUBLING THE BUT THE COST OF THOSE PROJECTS TO THE TAX. PAIRS OVERTIME. UNDER THE PUBLIC MAKING MODEL THAT WE SEE EN IN THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER IN NORTH DAKOTA MANY OF THIS FINANCING COSTS CAN BE CUT IN HALF [inaudible] SO [inaudible] WHEN? DEPOSITING A PUBLIC FUNDS I SEE A PUBLIC BANK IS ONE MORE SAFE PLACE TO PUT OUR PUBLIC FUNDS LIKE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INVESTMENT POLICIES HAVE MANY RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE AND HOW WE CAN DEPOSIT ANYONE FINANCED. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE INVESTMENT POLICIES THAT REQUIRES -- TO LOOK AND EVALUATE THOSE INSTITUTIONS BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOR. WHICH SEVERELY LIMITS US ARE A LOT OF FORCES US TO WAIVE SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS THE THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR. ANYWAY IN AN IRISH YOU'RE EITHER ON THIS -- ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE HEREWE DID THIS LITTLE BACKWARDS WE DID ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE IN OPPOSITION FIRST AND THEN WE HAD OUR WITNESSES SO WE'VE. SO I TRY IN SUPPORT SAID SO WE'RE WE'RE READY FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND FOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL. WELCOME THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE PROGRAM A PRIMARY WITNESS. AS WELL AS A SECONDARY. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A KICK **** OFF PERSON LAST NAME AN ORGANIZATION? I WANT TO GO FIRST A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS. OUR OPPOSITION IS A REALLY ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S pAVAILABLE TO PUT INTO A PUBLIC BANK SO IT'S CRAZINESS. FALSE PROMISE THAT. IF THE LAW PASSES AND THERE'S A METHOD IN A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH THAT A PUBLIC BIG COULD BE FUNDED WITH PUBLIC DOLLARS. THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR A SOLVENT PUBLIC BANK IS TEN YEARS OF THE OLD MAXIM MATURITY ON A COUNTY INVESTMENT IS. FIVE SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS THIS LEGISLATION CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT NO PUBLIC DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY POOL WILL EVER GO INTO ONE OF THESE BANKS TO FIND IT. AT THE BEGINNING AND FOR THE MORE THE COMPLIANCE AND OVERHEAD COSTS OF MEETING THE CURRENT THINKING RULES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. AND SO THE THE COST OF DOING THAT COMPLAINTS. CASH FLOW IN THE BANK FOR CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE IN OUR PRISON THAT THE STUDY WILL SHOW THAT THEY HAVE TO DO INDIVIDUALLY UNDER THE BILL. I'M I'M NOT CLEAR IF THE STUDY -- IF IT DOES SO THAT IT'S REALLY IN FEASIBLE DECIDE TO TAKE IT TO THE VOTERS. TO CONFIRM IT'S NOT FEASIBLE OR THE STUDY SAYS IT'S NOT FEASIBLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT TO THE VOTERS. BUT THAT PROPONENTS ARE YOU KNOW VERY -- PASSIONATE AND SO PRESENT THE DOLLAR TO PASS THIS COULD BE A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ASKED TO FIND A LOCAL STUDY. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE STUDY SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT. NOT FEASIBLE SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR FROM THE GET GO THAT. THERE'S NO COUNTY MONEY FOR THIS HELLO. BUT THAT THE RESPECT ASPIRIN ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS THING WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE COMMENTS AND ONE OF THE ITEMS JUST BROUGHT UP WHERE WAS GOING FOR THE HEARING COMMITTEE COULD DECEIVE POLICE FORCE ARE SIR FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JASON L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G WITH&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WERE ON THE FOURTH POLICY CAN MANY NOW AND WE STILL HAVE YET TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN A PUBLIC BANK TAKES ON LOSSES -- AND HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED I THINK APPROPRIATELY CERTAINLY NOT IF YOU PUT ON A A BANKING LANDS IN AND ASK THE QUESTION. THE ANSWER SEEMED TO BE INADEQUATE WE'VE HEARD THAT -- THE BILL REQUIRES FDIC INSURANCE -- WE'VE HEARD THAT THE BILL REQUIRES A FEASIBILITY STUDY BUT IN REALITY. EVERY BANK TAKES ALL LOSSES -- NO MATTER WHAT THE FEASIBILITY STUDY SAYS. PUBLIC BANK WILL TAKE ON LOSSES THE MOST RISK ADVERSE BANK OPERATING IN THE MOST SAFE AND SOUND MANNER WILL HAVE LOSSES. PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS -- THEY GET ILL -- AND SO THE QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PUBLIC BANK TAKES TAKES ALL LOSSES FROM FROM LOANS THAT IT MAKES. YOU KNOW IN A IN A IN A PRIVATE BANK -- THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE ULTIMATELY ARE THE ONES THAT PUT UP THE CAPITAL -- THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE OWNER'S EQUITY -- SO YOU HAVE SORT OF FDIC INSURANCE WHICH IS A GOOD THING BUT THAT ONLY PROTECT YOUR DEPOSITORS HE DOESN'T PROTECT YOUR OWNER'S EQUITY AND IN THE CASE OF THE PUBLIC BANK THE OWNER'S EQUITY IS THE TAXPAYER. THE TXPAYERS PUTTING UP THE CAPITAL TO STAND UP THE BANK AND WHEN YOU HAVE AN EROSION OF THAT CAPITAL DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE LOAN LOSSES. WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS INSTANCE WITH THE STATE HAVE TO COME IN AND STEP IN AND BACK FILL THOSE LOSSES WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF ITS OWN BUDGET. TO BACK FILL THOSE LOSSES AND IF IT DOES WHAT HAPPENS OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS. RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS A DISPARATE TAX TREATMENT -- FOR A PUBLIC BANK FIRST AS A PRIVATE BANK. AND THE ANALYSIS EVEN CONCLUDES THAT THAT PUTS PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO A PUBLIC BANK. THAT'S GOING TO MOST ACUTELY BE FELT BY YOUR COMMUNITY BANKS YOUR YOUR STATE CHARTERED INSTITUTIONS THAT OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AND LESS IMPACTFUL PROBABLY TO THE LARGER BANKS -- AND THEY FINALLY LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT -- WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT -- THE LAST FOUR POLICY COMMITTEES THAT -- THIS IS A A PUBLIC BANK FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WERE NOT ALLOWING THE PUBLIC IN CHARTER CITIES TO HAVE A SAY. IN WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT A BANK A PUBLIC BANK. IN THAT WERE ONLY LIMITING THE PUBLIC VOTE -- SPECIFICALLY TO GENERAL LAS CITIES THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THE GENERAL US CITIES OR OR CHARTER CITIES HAVE THE PUBLIC HAS LESS OF A RIGHT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE LESS OF A SAY IN A IN A CHARTER CITY. THAN A GENERAL LAW CITY. YOU KNOW THE POLLING SHOWS THAT DO NOT WANT TO PUBLIC BANK IN LOS ANGELES THE CHARTER BE AMENDMENT IN NOVEMBER FAILED BY THE PUBLIC DOESN'T WANT A PUBLIC BANK WE URGE A NO VOTE. HE'S MY SERVER NOT GONNA WELCOME ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION PERSON LAST NAME ORGANIZATION. ROBBER WILSON WITH A CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN OPPOSITION THIS WAS. THE MORNING CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BEAR COUNCIL PULSE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MORNING ELLERY NEAR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S LIKE TO BE TO DO A LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION LOOKING FOR ALASKA. WE BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR WITNESSES WHO WERE OPPOSITION AND HAVE OUR TO AUTHORS HERE TO BILL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER JUST ONE ITEM THAT IN YOUR URN IT OVER? TO US IN NUMBER CHIU IN SANTIAGO TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY ITEMS -- THAT THEY HAVE HEARD. BUT IN REGARDS TO THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF A BANG. FIRST AND FOREMOST -- HAVE TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION ORGANIZED AND I'M GONNA PARAPHRASING IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG HOMES ON AGE SIXTEEN THE BILL. ON THE MAIN THING IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT STUDY WOULD NEED TO BE ADVANCED. ON THEN UP FOR PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC VOTE. BRING THE VOTERS IN TO EXPRESS THEIR VOICE. THE GOVERNING BOARD WHO ISSUED THE STUDY ON GIVING EXAMPLE. ABOARD SUPERVISORS ARE CITY COUNCIL. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT THE STUDY. REGARDLESS I AM ONLY THEN. BUT WITH A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE ADVANCED. SO I THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE READING. THE THE BILL BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE MAY NEED TO STILL BE SOME QUESTIONS ON THAT. IN CLARIFICATION. LIKE TO TURN OVER TO SOME OF CHIU. C. OR SANTIAGO SEETHER ANY ITEMS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO COVER PRIOR TO GOING TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- THAT YOU HEARD FROM OPPOSITION SURE THERE ARE A COUPLE ITEMS ARE PART OF THE OPPOSITION AND ANTICIPATE -- SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT SO HAPPY DID TO DRILL DOWN WITH REGARDS TO TO TAX TREATMENT IT IS NOT TYPICAL THAT WE WOULD TAX. OF PUBLIC ENTITIES -- AND AND CLEARLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A LOCAL JURISDICTION. THAT DECIDES TO USE PUBLIC FUNDS TO HELP CAPITALIZE THE BANK. IT WOULD BE UNORTHODOX TO SUGGEST THAT WE OUGHT TO TAX OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS -- AND I WOULD SAY WE WOULD BE TREATING THE PUBLIC BANKS I WAS WE WOULD CREDIT UNIONS WHICH ALSO ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO TAXES SO -- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A POLICY CALL -- BUT ONE THAT WE THINK MAKES SENSE WITH REGARDS TO THE ANTICIPATION OF LOSSES AS THE CHAIRMAN JUST SAID. THE PROCESS TO APPLY FOR CHARTER WOULD INVOLVE THE ANALYSIS IN THE FEASIBILITY STUDY -- THE PUTTING TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN AND THOSE TWO ITEMS WOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE SAY LOCAL CITY COUNCIL WOULD WOULD APPROVE IT. CLEARLY THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH LOSSES THOSE WOULD BE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS. THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE ADDRESSED IN A BUSINESS PLAN IN A FEASIBILITY STUDY. AND CERTAINLY QUESTIONS THAT A PUBLIC WOULD WANT TO KNOW -- BEFORE SAY A CITY COUNCIL WERE TO VOTE ON IT -- FOR AS A VOTERS WOULD CONSIDER IT AT THE BALLOT BOX SO I WOULD -- THESE WOULD BE ADDRESSED -- THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- I THINK THOSE WERE PROBABLY THE TWO MAIN ISSUES THAT I HEARD. REYES BY THE OPPOSITION BUT OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN A WE LIKE TO BE A TOURIST CENTER GOING ON AS YOU'D LIKE ME TO JOIN IN ON THE ALL RESPECT COMMITTEE IN THE END LEAVE IT TO THE TO ONE OF THE AUTHORS A PERCENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATORS WOULD LIKE TO BE BUILT OPEN UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS TIME SO BY SHEER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. WHEN I BECAME THE TREASURER FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE?

IT LIKE THE BABY DIAPERS AND ALL THE REST AND AND THEY THEY GAVE ME A LOT OF PUSH BACK ON I I SORT OF NEW TO THE JOB. AND I GATHER THIS IS CRAZY THAT THESE BANKS AREN'T HELPING ME OUT SO I I CONTACTED OF A FRIEND OF MINE GARY FINDLEY WHO IS THE TOP BANKING ATTORNEY IN ORANGE COUNTY -- HIS WIFE IS BECKY BAILEY FAMILY WHO IS INVOLVED WITH THIS. THE ASSOCIATION AND THE STATE. AND I RETAIN HIM AND I SAID YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ISSUE WELFARE CHECKS I'M GETTING PUSHED BACK. AND SO WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF STARTING A BANK AND AT THE TIME THE ONLY BANK WE FOUND THAT WAS DONE BY A BY A GOVERNMENTAL TYPE. ORGANIZATION WITH A RESERVATION SOMEWHERE IN THAT. MID MID PART OF OF THE OF THE COUNTRY -- BUT I YOU KNOW SO SO NORTH DAKOTA CAME AFTER MY RESEARCH -- SO WE STARTED DOWN THIS JOURNEY OF STARTING A BANK JUST FOR YOU KNOW TO HELP THOSE THAT ARE GETTING. CHECKS. FOR WELFARE NOT TO START A BANK BANK BUT SOMEHOW MAYBE A POINT OF SALE CARDS AND AND THEN REFILL THOSE AND JUST TRY TO HELP. A CERTAIN POPULATION SO WE MET. AND WE CONTACTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE THEY GAVE ME A LETTER OF APPROVAL I WE CONTACTED THE FBI SEE GOT A LETTER OF APPROVAL. CONTACTED -- THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF BANKING CAME ALL THE WAY DOWNTOWN LA HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION I'VE LAID OUT THE BUSINESS APPROACH. AND THEN THEY THEY ASKED HOW I FELT THAT THE MEETING WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE SUGGESTING OTHER BENEFITS. AND I SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO THROW ME OUT OF THIS OFFICE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES -- FOR PROPOSING AN IDEA LIKE THIS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME AND HOW IT HOW IT ALL PLAYED OUT. THEY WANTED A BUSINESS PLAN WE BUILT A BUSINESS PLAN. WEEK WEEKS WHICH SUCKS. SENATE AROUND ALL THE BANKS IN THE COUNTY THAT WERE SMALLER NOT THE BIG BANKS. JUST TO GET THEIR INPUT. AND AND WHAT CAME BACK WAS STATE ALL THE CEOS OF THESE BANKS ARE ONLY LIKE THE IDEA BUT THEY WANTED TO SERVE ON THE BOARD. BUT WE GET ALL THIS ANALYSIS WE LOOK AT ALL THE COSTS. IN AT THE END OF THE DAY THE COST BENEFIT WAS TO MINIMAL IT WAS JUST IT WAS IT WAS SOMETHING BUT IT WASN'T. ENOUGH TO SAY OKAY HOW DO WE TAKE ON ALL THE RISK ALL THE ACTIVITY. ALL THE AUDITS. ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND IF WE HAVE ONE LITTLE BLIP THEN WE HAVE A LOSS AND HOW DO WE JUSTIFY THAT. SO WAS IN A FUN EXPERIENCE SO IT'S KIND OF FUN THAT ALL THESE MEMORIES. COME BACK -- SO MEMBERS TO IN SANTIAGO YOU KNOW DOING THIS TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. AND A AND M.. AND NOW LOOKING AT AT THIS AS A BILL. SAW. I'M COMING FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF HAVING GONE THROUGH AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY -- EVEN SURPRISING MY LEGAL COUNSEL WHO RIDE WE WOULDN'T GET AS FAR AS WE EVEN DID JUST. THAT. THERE WAS AT LEAST SOME RECEPTIVE ATTY THE IDEA BUT WHAT AND THEN IT CAME BACK TO HOW DO I DEAL WITH MY C. E. O. AT THE COUNTY. AND AND AND AND AT THAT TIME I WAS HAVING. TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT WERE UPSET WHEN THEY WERE THIRTY HEARING. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT IT WAS LIKE OKAY THIS IS NOT A CORE THIS IS NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW? AND SO. BECAUSE THE COST FOR THE SAVINGS WERE AT THE END OF THE DAY NOT. THEY WERE JUST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE END OF THE DAY DOING ALL THAT. AND I SAID I THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO START A BANK SO I I I COMING FROM THAT BACKGROUND I LOOKED AT I LOOKED AT ALL THE BENEFITS THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR THE REASONS WHY WE SHOULD DO THIS. I KEEP TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITIES FROM WHICH THEY ARE SOURCED. THAT'S DOUBTFUL -- BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY. IT'S ACTUALLY A INVESTED IN -- CASH EQUIVALENTS YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY. EARNING MONEY WHICH MEANS THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU DIVEST FROM INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS THE INDIAN CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT VALUES BUT YOU MIGHT-BE THERE JUST WITH WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING INVESTED. LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE FEES PAID BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT TO LARGE BANKS I THINK THE SAVINGS ARE MINIMAL INCREASE THE LENDING CAPACITY OF LOCAL. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS VIA PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PUBLIC BANK BUT THEN YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO LOAN LOSSES WHICH IS A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION. STRENGTHENED SMALL BUSINESS LENDING COMMUNITIES BY OFFERING LOANS PERHAPS IT WILL MARKET RATES ND I I ALSO SAY THAT'S A MAYBE. AND ADDRESS LOCAL LOCALITIES INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING NEEDS AND I SAID THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY A POSITIVE I WOULDN'T SEE IT AS A AS A MAJOR POSITIVE. SO I JUST PUT THAT ALL OTHER MISTER CHAIR JUST THIS CONTEXT OF THE HISTORY THAT I'VE ENJOYED AND AND SO WITH THAT I I WILL I'LL BE OPPOSED BECAUSE I JUST. I I I I GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT AS BEING A IN SOMETHING THAT. IS BENEFICIAL AT THE END OF THE DAY TO TAXPAYERS TO TO TO COMPETE IN THE BROAD SCHEME OF THINGS. WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO I DON'T I'M NOT ASKING QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE HISTORY OF ALL THE FUN. OF THAT THIS IS AND I'M SURE THAT TESSA MEMBERS CHIU AND SANTIAGO HAD A LOT OF FUN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S A BIG PROJECT SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION THE FLOOR BY CENTER WIENER -- WILL HAVE DECEMBER CHEWED TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THE YEAR. LIFTED RESPONDED TO SOME OF THAT AND AND LOVE HEARING ABOUT THAT THAT YOUR EXERIENCE AND AND HAPPY TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE LET ME SEE REALLY. THREE THINGS FIRST WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROCESS. FOR ANY LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MOVE FOR WITH THE CHART OF A PUBLIC BANK IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY NO BONES ABOUT IT I HAVE SAID THAT. THE I THINK THE RISK WITH THIS LEGISLATION AS WE HAVE PLACE SO MANY REQUIREMENTS. ON WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO CHARTER PUBLIC BANK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THE END OF FIVE OR TEN YEARS FROM NOW. NO LOCAL JURISDICTION MAY BE SUCCESSFUL AT THAT BECAUSE IT'S HARD. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T TRY AND AND AND AND WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE PUBLIC BANKS AT THIS TIME IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE PUBLIC BANK EXPERIENCE IN IN NORTH DAKOTA. THESE ARE THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WERE SUGGESTED BEFORE WHEN WE JUST HAD A PRIVATE HEALTH SYSTEM THAT DIDN'T WORK ABOUT SUGGESTING WE NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH THE OR BEFORE WE HAD A PUBLIC TRANSIT. BEFORE PUBLIC TRANSIT WAS A CONCEPT OVER FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS A CONCEPT. YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO LET ME JUST SAY A FEW THINGS WHAT IS HAPPENED WITHIN THE BANKING INDUSTRY IN SPECIFICALLY. WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH WALL STREET BANKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST DECADE SO THAT WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO. IN THE PAST DECADE WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED PREDATORY LENDING. WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS OPEN IN THEIR NAMES WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS WHO'VE LOST. FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION. WE'VE HAD. AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS STUDENTS HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY GREEDY LENDERS. SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND THE PUBLIC WHOSE MONIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTED AGAINST THEIR VALUES AND FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES WITH GUN MANUFACTURERS WITH PRIVATE PRISONS. WITH COMPANIES WITH UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES WITHIN THE PAST DECADE SOMETHING IS TRULY BROKEN. WITH THE PRIVATE BANKING SYSTEM. AND I ALSO STE I JUST MENTION THAT -- OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS HAVE. PUSHED OUT 75% OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL BANKS. SO SOMETHING'S FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN SINCE YOUR EXPERIENCE FROM TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO AND WHAT WE ARE SAYING S AT THIS TIME. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE WANT TO EXPLORE IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY IT WILL BE DIFFICULT IT WILL BE HARD. BUT WE THINK THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK AND WE HOPE BY ASKING THESE QUESTIONS EITHER. THERE ARE SUCCESSES AND ESTABLISHING. LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS FOR THE WALL STREET BANKS. CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES NEED EITHER OUTCOME WOULD WORK WELL FOR US. BUT I THINK NOT HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS REALLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WE HAVE THE S. IN HERTZBERG CONSIDER BELL WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK QUICKLY AND THIS RIGHT HERE THANK YOU MISTER AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATE. THE ARGUMENT OF HAVING A LITTLE LEVERAGE. WITH THE BANKS BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE FIRM OF L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; AND LANE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND AS WELL TO WHAT WAS JUST SAID. I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEASURE WILL TURN IT OVER TO CENTER HERTZBERG IN CENTER ABOUT. THE ONLY PUBLIC BANK. NAY STATES WAS FORMED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN NORTH DAKOTA. IN A AT THE TIME. WHERE NORTH DAKOTA IS ECONOMIC FOUNDATION WAS INFORMED BY AGRICULTURE. AND THERE WERE BASICALLY. KNOWN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND THE BANK IN NORTH DAKOTA. ONLY ACCEPTS DEPOSITS FROM THE STATE AND THERE AGENCIES AND NOT FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. JUST THE STATE [inaudible] FARM. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE TREASURER YEAR TWO YEARS AGO CAMBER TOOK A LOOK AT THIS NOTION OF STATE BANKS. AND WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF STUDIES. DONE. FOR MANY YEARS BOOKS WRITTEN. FOR MANY YEARS. I'M CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IS EXTRAORDINARY IS WORLD CLASS. THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF STATE EMPLOYEE MONEY. IS INVESTED THROUGH A VERY POLITICALLY -- SENSITIVE ORGANIZATION CALLOUSED ORGANIZATIONS CASTERS AND CALPERS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SINCE SO MANY TIMES A REMEMBER WITH -- MAXINE WATERS ARE APARTHEID. ISSUES OF INVESTMENT IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS WE HAVE IMPOSED UPON RESOURCES OF CALIFORNIA EXTRAORDINARY VALUES NO QUESTION. WE ALSO HAVE DOZENS OF INSTRUMENTS FROM THRIFTS TO ALL KINDS OF INSTRUMENTS. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL TOOLS SOME OF THEM ARE QUESTIONABLE PAYDAY LENDING AND STOP WHICH WORKS EXAMINING NOW. IN THE LARGER DYNAMIC. AND I WOULD FURTHER SUGGEST THE STATE TREASURER AND LOCAL TREASURES PARTICULARLY OF LARGER JURISDICTIONS. ARE PROFESSIONALLY ADVISED AND SQUEEZE THE HECK. OUT OF PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS. TO TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE RATES ON DEALS. WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THAT ARE RUN BY GOVERNMENT AND THE COST AND TIME AND IS CHALLENGING. SO I'M VERY SKEPTICAL AND DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A PUBLIC BANK STRUCTURE WORKS. IN A PLACE LIKE CALIFORNIA. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE AND I'VE CERTAINLY GRAPPLED WITH THE CANNABIS SPACE. THE THE NORTH DAKOTA JUST YOU KNOW ASSURE YOU KNOW BUT FOR THE RECORD HERE. THERE IS NO FDIC INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS NO FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE. IT'S THE GENERAL FUND OF THE STATE THAT GUARANTEES THE DEPOSITS OF CREDITORS OF DEPOSITORS. DIFFICULTLY RISKY TO THE GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T INTEGRATE THROUGH THE FIFTY I SEE PROGRAM FOR THE BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INSURANCE. THAT BEING SAID. I'M OF FOR THIS TODAY BECAUSE I LIKE THE AUTHORS. AND I THINK THAT AND I THINK YOU'RE SMART GUYS. AND I THINK YOUR HONORABLE INSINCERE. I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. THE SUCH A PRETTY HIGH MARKS IN TERMS OF THE BILL WITH THE STANDARDS ARE. AND I THINK BE ABLE. TO MAKE THAT IS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT AND RIGHTEOUS THING TO DO TO ALWAYS BE DILIGENT TO ALWAYS INVENT THE FUTURE TO ALWAYS KEEP PUSHING TO ALWAYS FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S NEW AND BETTER WAYS TO MAKE IT WORK. TO LEVERAGE PEOPLE IF YOU CAN. YEAH HI MARK BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT AND I THINK YOU'LL TELL THE TRUTH JUST WHAT THE OUTCOMES GOING TO BE BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY MONEY TELLS THE TRUTH ON THESE THINGS WITH THE PEOPLE GROW INVEST WHAT'S RATE OF RETURN WITH THE COSTS ARTS. IT'S ARITHMETIC IS BROOKLYN USED TO SAY. NO CREATE COMPLEXITY TO IT. BUT I AM PERSUADED BY YOUR ARGUMENT THAT LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN GOVERNMENT THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH IS THAT WE DON'T ENGAGE IN THE CUTTING EDGE THINKING. CONTINUALLY PUSH THE ENVELOPE. ALL THE ARGUMENTS I GAVE TO YOU ARE BACKWARD ARGUMENTS THEY HAPPENED YESTERDAY. CAN YOU INVENT THE FUTURE I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S TOUGH. GO FIGURE IT OUT. I AM MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTERS PRISONER BELL -- JUST -- OF QUESTION OF THE PURPOSE OF A PUBLIC BANK. I KNOW SOONER STAFF REPORT THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUBLIC BANKS [inaudible] AND I'M KIND OF TYPICALLY INTEREST -- AND HOW A PUBLIC BANK WILL HAVE -- PEOPLE IN POVERTY [inaudible] AND WHEN I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR OF I WAS SO ON THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COUNTY. AND WE GOT A NOTICE. FROM THE BANK SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO CHARGE [inaudible] A FEE. FOR OUR CAL WORKS CARD ISN'T THAT THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED AND ORANGE COUNTY PROBABLY. OF WE ALSO -- THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO CHARGE A FEE. TO EACH TRANSACTION. USED BY SOMEBODY WITH A ELECTRONIC DEPOSIT THAT WENT INTO THEIR ACCOUNT. FOR CAL WORKS WE ALSO HAD -- OF YOUR THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- SOMEBODY UNDER PUBLIC CHARGE JOURNAL ASSISTANCE WE CALL IT. THEY'RE GIVEN LIKE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. OUT OF THE COUNTY AND THEY ALSO CHARGED -- PEOPLE ON GENERAL ASSISTANCE -- A FEE. ARE THE COUNTY. AT THE BANK. IN A CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP. WHERE THERE ARE PROVIDING SERVICE? OF FOR THE COUNTY AND THEIR GENERAL DEPOSITS AND SERVICES. AT THE COUNTY NEED WHICH INCLUDED. THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD CAL WORKS WITH YOU KNOW THAT'S I THINK WE REFERRED TO WELFARE BUT HOW IT WORKS -- DEPOSITS. AND THEN I ALSO FOUND OUT RECENTLY. THERE ARE JOB PEOPLE ON SS I HIGH. PER ATM TRANSACTIONS ARE CHARGED. EIGHT DOLLARS IN SOME CASES -- THERE [inaudible] TRANSACTIONS [inaudible] ARM. EIGHT DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY IN THESE CHARGES ARE A LOT OF MONEY [inaudible] THERE ARE. PEOPLE IN POVERTY. ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND I A KIND OF WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS. FROM MY STANDPOINT. THE PURPOSE OF THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT CITY GOVERNMENT IS. TO MAYBE ELIMINATE. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN SOCIETY HOMELESSNESS POVERTY AND SO FORTH. BUT WHEN WE ARE TAKING OUR MONEY AND PUTTING IT INTO. A INSTITUTION THAT IS THEN. CHARGING FOR THEMSELVES MONEY. AT THE SAME TIME LOANING OUR MONEY. TO YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT COULD NOT IT MIGHT BE IN SOME OTHER STATE PROBABLY. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. SO MY QUESTION IS. WE HAVE 20% PART IN CALIFORNIA. SHOULD WE HAVE SOME. CONSCIOUS ABOUT. THE DEPOSITS IN OPERATIONS AND AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC THANK [inaudible] CONCEPT. CAN BE USED TO ENCOURAGE THAT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT COULD BE USED TO ENCOURAGE THAT. DO NOT CHARGE THESE PEOPLE THESE FEES. BECAUSE I'M GETTING A LOT OF COMPLAINTS AND I'M REAL SERIOUS BECAUSE I HEARD THIS. TRUST THIS WEEKEND. AN EARLIER FRIDAY. WHEN I HAD MY SENIOR HEALTH FAIR IN SAN JOSE AND I HEARD PEOPLE COMING UP TO ME? AND TALKING ABOUT HOW. THEY WERE. LOSING THEIR HOUSES BECAUSE A CAR FOR THE RANT. IN THEIR IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE LOSING THEIR PLACES TO LIVE. AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE CHARGING A SET BY SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH WHAT WHAT'S. THEY SAID WELL WE GOT THIS LETTER SAYING WE WE HAVE. TO PAY THIS EXTRA BE SO. I'D LIKE TO AUTHORS OF THE BILL PERHAPS [inaudible] TO HOW CAN. PUBLIC BANKS BE USED TO HELP. OUR PEOPLE IN NEED THAT OUR GOVERNMENTS -- ESPECIALLY -- COUNTY GOVERNMENTS TO BE IN A COUNTY. COUNTY COUNTY -- ORDER SUPERVISORS MEMBER FOR TWELVE YEARS. YOU KNOW OUR BASIC PURPOSE IS TO HELP THESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I I THINK YOUR QUESTION FRAMES EXACTLY WHY THERE IS SO MUCH SUPPORT FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OUR LOWEST INCOME. CALIFORNIANS BUT IT'S ABOUT MOST INCOMES ARE OUTSIDE OF THE TOP CURRENT. BANKING SYSTEM THAT'S BEING DRIVEN BY WALL STREET BANKS ARE SERVING THEIR NEEDS. AS I ALLUDED TO BEFORE -- THE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL COMES FROM MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DON'T THINK THAT THE PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES THAT THEY'VE SEEN FROM WALL STREET OUR ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS CERTAINLY THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING THE FACT THAT THERE IS SO LITTLE? ACCESS TO CAPITAL FROM WALL STREET BANKS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO DRESSER HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND AGAIN THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS. IS IS IS A MAJOR REASON WHY REMOVING FOR WITH THIS I WILL MENTION. BEFORE THE THE ARE ARE -- RECENT DEPARTED MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR LEE BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY HE HAD. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. HE WANTED ME TO CARRY A BILL. TO PUSH WALL STREET ANKS TO DO A BETTER JOB. AND AND I KNOW ACTION FOUR OF US -- IS A LOBBYIST FOR THE CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO AND SHE% KNEW. THAT MERELY HAD WANTED US TO MOVE FOR THE BILL -- TO PUSH WALL STREET BANKS TO PROVIDE LOW OR NO INTEREST LOANS TO CITIES TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS DATA SOMETHING PUBLIC BANKS COULD DO. I SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE. THE CHALLENGE IN RECENT YEARS IN. IN BEING ABLE TO EMPLOY OUR LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES FROM THIS SECTOR. AND STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO MOVE UP THE EDUCATIONAL LADDER SO THEY CAN GET THE JOBS THAT THEY NEED TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. THEY HAVE BEN NOT MET BY WHAT ARE WALL STREET BANKS ARE DOING SO -- WE FOR STRUCTURE THIS BILL TO REQUIRE. A PROPOSAL FOR PUBLIC BANK TO DELINEATE WHAT WHO THEY'RE TRYING TO SERVE AS A MOVE FOR WHETHER IT BE. THE HOUSING SECTOR WHETHER BE PREDATORY LENDERS WHETHER BE SMALL BUSINESSES SO THIS WOULD BE LAID OUT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. PROPOSED TO CITY COUNCILS PROPOSED TO VOTERS FOR THEIR SUPPORT BUT IT IS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS NOW BUT LET ME. AND WITH ONE FINAL THANKS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO IS TRY TO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REPLICATE TYPICAL RETAIL SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED. EITHER BY PRIVATE BANKS FOR BY CREDIT UNIONS OR COMMUNITY BANKS THAT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE THAT WHAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY SAYS THAT THERE DO WHICH IS PROVIDE CAPITAL. LENDS. PROVIDE LENDING AND LOANS TO TO PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE. THEIR GOALS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY WHATHAPPENS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW WHICH IS PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE BEING PUT TO USE. WITH INDUSTRIES THAT DO NOT SERVE CALIFORNIANS INDUSTRIES WHOSE VALUES ARE ANTITHETICAL TO CALIFORNIANS. AND INDUSTRIES THAT CERTAINLY ARE NOT HELPING THE LOWEST INCOME. IN OUR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE PEOPLE. THAT I'VE TALKED. TO THAT ARE ON SSI. THAT ARE DEVELOP ME DISABLED. THE BILL ME DISABLED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TO OUR DEPARTMENT OR LETTERMAN ACT. THEY'RE BEING CHARGED. THE EIGHT DOLLARS FOR THEIR SERVICING. ON THEIR ACCOUNTS. THERE IS A A PUBLIC. CHARGE THEIR THEIR THE PUBLIC WE'RE WE'RE WE THE PUBLIC. OUR BY. THE LATERAN ACT RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE PEOPLE. IN TERMS OF THEIR LIVES IN THEIR STABILITY AND LIVING CONDITIONS TRANSACTION THEY NEED TO HAVE OF AND I JUST DON'T I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T. LOOK AT SOME OPTIONS LIKE A PUBLIC BANKER ANY OTHER OPTION OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PUBLIC BANK. THAT WE CAN USE TO PROTECT THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THIS IS GOT TO BE ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS. IS TO PROTECT THESE PEOPLE FROM. HAVING LESS INCOME BECAUSE YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY. EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET WE CONSIDER INCREASES [inaudible] FOUR COST OF LIVING. FOR PEOPLE ON THE LATTER ENACT. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND ON SSI IT'S VERY DIFFICULT EVERY YEAR TO GET FUNDS. IN THE BUDGET. AND IT'S ALWAYS A BIG FIGHT. AND WE HAD ONE YEAR AT ONE POINT WHERE THE PROGRAMS FOR LETTERMAN ACT. IT WAS SIXTEEN YEARS WITHOUT AN INCREASE SIXTEEN YEARS WENT BY. WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN FINALLY -- BY SOME PEOPLE. CHAINING HIMSELF TO THE BARE. THE FRONT. OFFICE MARYLAND IN AND I WAS SITTING HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SERGEANTS CALLED ME. AND THEY SAID WE SENATOR WE'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE. AND GO TALK TO THESE PEOPLE. THE MAN AND THEY THEY PULLED ME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE THAT WERE. GOING TO CHAIN THEMSELVES TO THE BARE. AND I I THINK I THINK WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE WE GOT TO HAVE THIS [inaudible] RECKONING OF WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING TO PROTECT THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE MONEY IS THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO THESE PEOPLE IT'S GOING. TO OTHER PLACES AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. SO I I'M LOOKING I'M LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF IMPROVEMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING A PUBLIC MAC OR ANY OTHER OPTION. OR MAYBE SOME OTHER KIND OF FINANCIAL. INSTITUTION THAT COULD HELP THESE PEOPLE. SURVIVE IN THIS STATE THAT IS IS SO HIGH COST OF LIVING FOR THE IN A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BECOMING HOMELESS. AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. MR TERM MISTER BY JIM I RESPOND. MEMORY SANTIAGO PLEASE THANK YOU -- I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING A CO AUTHOR IN AND IT'S MEANINGFUL THAT TO HAVE YOUR INPUT -- AND HELP. THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT IT WHAT WHAT YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. UNACCEPTABLE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS DOWN THAT WAS SOMEBODY IS. IS IN POVERTY SOMEBODY'S ON SSI THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BANKING SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD CHARGE -- VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT HIGH OF A FEE JUST TO ACCESS DOLLARS WELL I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY -- PERHAPS OF THE LOBBYIST FOR THE BANKING INDUSTRY COULD. BUT BUT I TELL TELL YOU AMONGST. ONE OF THE VERY MANY REASONS AS TO WHY -- I WAS. MOVED TO ADD COME BARK ON THIS NEW IDEA. I'M IN A LOT OF US OF LAID OUT OF HER REASONS AND WE SEE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND WE SEE. ALMOST POPULATION AND WE SEE PEOPLE AS A SIGN WE SEE THAT THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORKING FOLKS I MEAN THE BOTTOM LINE IS NOT WORKING FOR FOLKS WE'RE NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION WE HAVE RENTS ARE SKYROCKETING AND AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT PUBLIC BANK ISN'T FIX ALL THIS RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE STEP IT'S ONE THING BUT WE CAN CHECK A SYSTEM A WE CAN FIND A DIFFERENT WAY IN A NEW. WAY OF DOING THINGS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO AT THAT HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH PEOPLE. WHO SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE AND WE ALL AGREE WE GOT A CHALLENGE JUST AS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IS NOT WORKING FOR&lt;/c&gt;</u> FOLKS THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE? AND AN END WHEN I BEFORE I WAS IN PUBLIC OFFICE -- IN THE ASSEMBLY. I REMEMBER -- IN WHERE THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND I REPRESENT -- WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE SENIOR HOUSING PROJECT THAT WAS COMING UP. AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED I WENT -- WAS IN AN OFFICE YEAH BUT I COULDN'T DEAL WITH THAT TRY TO DUPLICATE THE SORT OF WORK. AND DURING THE SPEECHES I HAD HEARD THAT IT TOOK US SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS TO PUT THE FINANCING TOGETHER FOR THIS PROJECT AND I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED ALTHOUGH I KNEW HOW BENEFICIAL WAS TO THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE LESS. THAN A HUNDRED UNITS COME UP AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO PUT A FINANCING MECHANISM FOR THAT MANY YEARS -- FOR SENIOR HOUSING JUST DROVE ME NUTS AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF BUT WHEN WE WERE EMBARKING ON THIS -- IT LOOK. THE WALL STREET BRAND BUT BANK IS IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDERS IN IT'S GOING TO TRY THE YIELD THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PROFIT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IT'S THE PROFIT MOTIVE IT'S HOW THEY OPERATE. BUT BUT WHAT ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK THAT SAYS THIS IS WHAT THE NEED IS IN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR COMMUNITIES MAYBE WE'RE NOT YELLING THE BEST RETURN BUT IT'S THE IT'S A PUBLIC GOAL IT AND WE CAN HELP. FINANCE -- US A FOUR WHEEL HOUSING UNITS WE CAN HELP THE FINANCE -- SENIOR HOUSE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS SENIOR HOUSING. LOOK IN IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU HEALTH FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT'S THAT ONE BRIDGE LOAN THAT HELPS THE HELPS TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FOR FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE A TO BE ABLE -- TO PURCHASE A HOME I'M I'M REALLY NOT THAT SO I HAVE A LOT OF HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS ULTIMATELY ALL NOT BE ABLE TO TERMINATE BECAUSE THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS PUBLIC GOOD IS. BUT I THINK IT I I THINK IT BEHOOVES US. AS LITTLE AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO TRY TO SOLVE. SOME OF THESE -- SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD AND AND YOU'VE GOT TO START BY SHAKING UP THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. TO FIND A NEW WAY TO DO IT. IT'S NOT WORKING FOR FOLKS WE GET IT WE HAVE. A REAL QUICK SO WE HAVE -- CENTER TARA WOULD LIKE TO TO SPEAK IF THAT WORKS ALREADY GOING TO CENTER HERTZBERG AND THEN BACK TO THE VICE CHAIR SEND HER TIME. THE CHAIR I SO I EIGHT SUPPORT THE EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT RIGHT -- I JUST. I REPRESENT THE SENATE DISTRICT THAT IS. SUPER IMPOVERISHED WE STRUGGLE WITH GETTING JUST ENOUGH MONEY. OUR BASIC NEEDS LIKE. WATER AND AND AND AND HEALTH CARE -- AND MY CONCERN WITH THIS THIS BILL IS. THE LOS OBVIOUSLY -- BUT ALSO I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF I SUPPORT. A BILL LIKE THIS BUT IT WORKS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS. FOR A POPULATION THAT I REPRESENT -- I MY DISTRICT MY COMMUNITIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH. TOWARDS GETTING A PUBLIC BANK BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS. AND SO I I AM NOT OPPOSED TO TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO YOU IN. AND CONCEPT AYE AYE. I DON'T DISAGREE. BUT I WANT TO GET TO A PLACE AND MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN TO CONTINUE HAVE CONVERSATIONS I CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE I CAN SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND THEIR NOT BEING ADDRESSED BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS FOR MY DISTRICT -- TO AND THAT IN THE PROCESS THAT WE DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE. FOR MY COMMUNITY AND AND ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THAT BRIEF BUT IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY SO. I WILL I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I WANT TO LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN. TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND IN MAKING SURE THAT -- YOU CONTINUING A PATTERN THAT. MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL IN THAT. WE PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. DID YOU JUST A VERY QUICK RESPONSE SO FIRST OF ALL PREVIOUS YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS. THIS DEEPLY. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO IN NORTH DAKOTA THE SITUATION FACING THE ROLE. AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN NORTH DAKOTA WERE ACTUALLY QUITE SIMILAR TO WHAT I THINK YOU ARE GRAPPLING WITH IN YOUR DISTRICT AND THE RESIDENTS OF NORTH DAKOTA CHOSE AT THAT TIME TO MOVE FOR WITH THE MODEL THAT IS WORKING FOR THEM AND WORKING WELL -- SECONDLY IF THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN OTHER IDEAS THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE THIS BILL DOESN'T FORCE ANY JURISDICTION TO DO ANYTHING IT SIMPLY PROVIDES CHOICE. AND IF THERE ARE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WANT TO DO FOR MOVE THIS FORWARD. MY HOPE IS WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL CHARTERS OF LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS IT WILL BECOME A PROVEN MODEL. AND AT THAT TIME CITIES AND AND AND AND COUNTIES IN YOUR REGION -- WILL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE LOOK FOR TO THE ONGOING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO I CENTER TITLE SO WHAT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO DO THAT WORKS FOR FOLKS WHO LIKE TO GO TO CENTER HERTZBERG. NO MISTER LANE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER A FEW COMMENTS AND WE'D LIKE TO BE TO GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. SO I WOULD THINK YOU CAN CENTER TARA WE'RE GONNA CENTER HERTZBERG MYLINCOLN MISTER LANE IN THE VICE CHAIR CENTER HERTZBERG DIVERTED SPOKEN I JUST BILL BRIEFLY TO ADD INTO THE RICHNESS OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE. I TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ISSUE WITH WHAT -- BELLS AND THE LIKE WE'RE GONNA SEE TECHNOLOGY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WE HAVE THREE MILLION UNBANKED UNDER BANK PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LEVEL IN TERMS OF BANKING THAT THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH BANKING COSTS THEM. HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR MONEY GO TO CHECK CASHING SERVICE AND YOU WANT TO CHECK CASH A CHECK. QUESTION BUNCH OF MONEY IN TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY WITH TELEPHONES WERE GOING TO COME UP WITH WAYS WE CAN LITERALLY DOWNLOAD. YOUR YOUR CARD ON TO THE ONTO YOUR PHONE YOU CAN PAY FOR EVERYTHING WITH YOUR PHONE TRANSACTION CHARGES WILL BE TO MINIMUS. ABILITY TO GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL WE TO MINIMUS WE'RE ALREADY SEEING ONLINE OF NEW WAYS BANKING IS ALL ABOUT DETERMINING TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS OF YOUR LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT SIDE. AS TO WHETHER WE CAN SUPPORT THE VALUES. SECOND SIDE IS WHAT YOU DO THE MONEY CAN YOU SUPPORT THE VALUES AND HOW DOES THAT WORK. WELL AND THE THIRD THING ABOUT IT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES IS IS EVALUATE RISK. IS SOMEBODY I'M GONNA GIVE A LOAN TO WAR OVER ACCOUNT WITH A THEY SOMEBODY'S RISKY WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE INTERNET TODAY. THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF WAYS EVEN IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS THE LIKE. YOU TALK TO THE THE BEST THINKERS IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY. YOU LITERALLY CAN DO BETTER RISK PROFILES DETERMINING WHAT PEOPLE DO ON THE INTERNET. THEN YOU CAN BASED UPON -- THEIR CREDIT PROFILE BECAUSE COULD PROPOSES AND CONSIDERED FOR YOU PAY YOUR YOUR YOUR UTILITY BILL IT DOESN'T GET THE DECISION OF A CREDIT CARD DOESN'T SAY YOU PAY YOUR RENT TO PAY YOUR RENT IN CASH. THERE'S A NUMBER OF NEW METHODOLOGIES SO WHEN WE LOOK TO EXT TO TO SOLVE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING. THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE WITH LESS MEANS IN ALL OF THOSE A REVOLUTION MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION. YOU KNOW BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF IS TO TRADITIONAL BANKING. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS THINK ABOUT IT PLATE WHAT WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT YOU KNOW IN IN IN. IN KENYA AND AFGHANISTAN THEY ALL THE SOLDIERS GET PAID ON THE TELEPHONE SO THIS IS THE GENERAL'S CAN'T STEAL THE MONEY. TRANSACTION COSTS ARE FRACTIONS OF A PENNY COMPARE WOULD PEOPLE PAY NOW THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT ABILITY FOR SOMEONE ON A CAL FRESH TO GET THEIR MONEY ON THE PHONE. AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND MOST EVERYBODY HAS AND IF NOT. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU THE PHONE BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER THAN THE OTHER THINGS TO THE POINT YOU RAISE WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE WITH LESS MONEY. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT THE OPPORTUNITIES GREAT PEOPLE THE MIDDLE AGAIN AGAINST THE MIDDLE PEOPLE CAN GET SQUEEZED AND THIS TO ME. IS SOMETHING IS YOU BEGIN TO ANALYZE THIS AND I SUSPECT HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED TO REALLY ENGAGE BECAUSE THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE OPPORTUNITIES. TO TAKE CARE OF FOLKS GOING FORWARD. THIS WINTER LITERATURE MISALIGNED THE BANKERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND AS SENATOR BILLS COMMENTS -- CALIFORNIA IS IN FACT AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PLACE TO LIVE AND THAT IS NOT LOST ON ME AS A RESIDENT AND BUT THE INDUSTRY IS. IF NOT THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES ITS BINS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COMPLIANCE COSTS ALONE. IT HAS C. R. A. OBLIGATIONS FULLY AT THE EFFORT IT PAYS TAXES. THE INDUSTRY PAYS IT'S EMPLOYEES HIGHER WAGES THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. IT IS FANCIFUL TO THINK THAT A PUBLIC BANK WON'T SIMILARLY HOW AFTER INCURRING THOSE COMPLIANCE COSTS AND IT WON'T HAVE TO CHARGE FEES. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE. RELATIVE TO THE COMMENT MADE THAT THE PUBLIC THINKS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS FAILED IT. THE DATA DOESN'T BEAR THAT OUT THE POLLING THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED BY SOME FAIRLY WELL KNOWN POLLSTERS SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE BEING SERVED. BY THEIR CREDIT UNIONS AND THEIR BANKS AND I WOULD JUST SAY THIS IF THAT'S THE TRUTH IF THE IF THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS SUCH. THAT THE PUBLIC THINKS THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS FAILED THEM. THEN WHY NOT PUT THE PUBLIC THANK QUESTION TO A VOTE OF EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF JUST GENERAL LOST CITIES. I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. YEAH I THINK WE HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE MY PERSPECTIVE IS TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HARMED. AND YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY BEING HARMED YES THEY ARE. AND AND YOU KNOW YEAH YOU'RE REGULATED BUT AT THE SAME TIME. REGULATIONS THAT YOU INFLUENCE THE WRITING OF SO. ON FOR ME FOR ME QUITE FRANKLY I'M I'M. FOR FOCUSING A LITTLE BIT. ON THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T GET ENOUGH FOCUS WHICH IS THE 20%. OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S AND POVERTY. AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE. PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDER OUR CHARGE AS A PUBLIC AGENCY. WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTY OR THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT ARE UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES. THERE ARE ACTUALLY BEING CHARGED. BEING CHARGED RIGHT NOW. AND I I I THINK THAT'S ON TALL AND UNACCEPTABLE [inaudible] IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. GIVEN HE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD SUCH A HARD TIME. PROVIDE THEM WITH HOUSING FOOD SHELTER -- PROGRAMS FOR THEM. IT'S IT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO CHARGE HIM SO THAT'S ACTIVE THEN THE BANK SIDE I I REALIZE THAT AN I I'M I'M ELECTED TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN MY MY COMMUNITY. AND MY PERSPECTIVE IS VERY WELL KNOWN AND LIKE. OKAY SO I I THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL. AND I'D BE WILLING TO CONSIDER A PUBLIC [inaudible] BANK OPTION. I THINK THERE IS. SOMETHING IS WILLING. TO WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO EXPLORE THE SUBJECT SO THAT'S WHY I WOULD SUPPORT THE BILL. THANKS SO MUCH FOR CENTER WITH A TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER LANE I YOU WERE YOU DIDN'T BONTA THE SPECIFIC CONCERN ABOUT SSI. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT DIRECT DEPOSIT AN AUTOMATIC CHARGES OUT OF A CHECKING ACCOUNT. THERE ARE NO CHARGES. AN EIGHT DOLLAR FEE? I'M NOT SURE THERE MAY BE A FEE TO MAINTAIN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT THAT DOESN'T HAVE DIRECT DEPOSIT. SO THE I MEAN THERE IS A CONSTANT ISSUING SO -- USING THE SERVICE AND AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO I I DON'T KNOW. A A WITHOUT SPECIFIC. INFORMATION I COULDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION -- AHEAD OF RELIGIOUS YOU'RE SITTING ON THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. AND EVERY TIME THE STATE AUDITOR COMES OUT WITH A REPORT I JUST CRINGE. THE STATE CAN'T RUN ANYTHING CAN'T RUN THE DMV. CAN'T RUN HIGH SPEED RAIL. CAN'T RUN CALTRANS SPENDING THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ON REPAIRING ROADS. SO I MISSED YOUR I'VE. I I'M I'M SCARED TO DEATH. HONESTLY TO SEE OF THE STATE TRYING TO RUN A BANK IT JUST IT WOULD MYSTIFIED ME YOU GOT TO READ THESE REPORTS I WISH I HAD A REPORT ONCE FROM. OUR STATE DAUGHTER THAT SAID THIS DEPARTMENTS RUNNING GREAT AND THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING'S FINE IT'S NOT NO INTRO CONTROLLED. YOUR BUT I'M I'M ARE THESE REPORTS HAVE BEEN. EXTREMELY DISTURBING. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I I I'M OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT STATE WOULD NOT BE RUNNING THE BANK COULD BE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT JUST BAFFLES ME THAT -- WHILE THE STATE HAS CHALLENGES I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO TAKE A LOOK AT MISSISSIPPI. COURAGE YOU GO TAKE A LOOK AT KENTUCKY. URGE YOU TO GO LOOK AT THE MEXICO GO LOOK AT SEVERAL OTHER STATES SEE HOW THEY RUN THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE. BEEN COMPARED WITH CALIFORNIA. SO JUST WOULD ENCOURAGE SOME ADDITIONAL DUE DILIGENCE ON THAT -- CENTER BELL THERE ANY OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ANY ADDITIONAL -- DISCUSSION OR DEBATE HERE FROM THE DICE PLACE IN A WINNER. VERY BRIEFLY I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE OUR CITIES. THE OPTIONS -- TO DO THAT CITING THERE'S A THERE'S ALWAYS A THIS PUSH BACK AND HOSTILITY. AGAINST. GOVERNMENT DOING THINGS AND THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND SOME OF OUR AGENCIES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT? MANY OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT. IS THE HAS DONE REALLY WELL LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY OR THE GOVERNMENT WORK THAT LED TO THE INTERNET BEING CREATED I MEAN THERE'S A GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO DO THINGS WELL NOT ALWAYS BUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR FRANKLY ALSO. MESSES THINGS UP BUT WHEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALMOST DESTROYED OUR ECONOMY AND TWO THOUSAND AND EAT OR THEREABOUTS THAT WAS THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT WAS NOT GOVERNMENT. SO. YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW CITIES TO TRY THIS OUT NICE. MUCH PLEASE ENTER YOUR MAIN SILENCE THAT WERE COMING TO THE END AND I MUST SPEAK OUT I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ACTUALLY AT THE BALLOT. MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR THE SENATE MY OPPONENT HAD AUTHORED A BILL TO CREATE A STATE BANK. THAT BECAME A HUGE ISSUE AN ELECTION. AND I WAS ABLE TO PREVAIL IN A SIXTY THIRTY DISTRICT. IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF THE DISTRUSTED PEOPLE HAD BEEN TRUSTING. THANKS THE STATE RUN THE BANKS. OVER THE DECADES MY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH GOVERNMENT. AND I'M FOLLOWING ON UNDER MORLOCKS OBSERVATIONS. SHOWS ME THE GOVERNMENT GETS VERY LITTLE RIGHT. WE HAVE SQUANDERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON A TRAIN. MULTI BILLION DOLLARS ON ALL THE HIGH TECH PROJECTS WE TRIED TO DEPLOY IN CALIFORNIA. NONE OF THEM COME IN ON TIME AND ALL INCOME IN WAY OVER BUDGET. AND IT IT JUST SHOWS ME THAT THIS WOULD BE A VERY RISKY THING. TO TRUST. THE GOVERNMENT. THE RUN OUR BANKS. THERE MAY BE FAILURES OF COURSE WITH REGULAR BANKS BUT THE RECORD OF GOVERNMENT DOES NOT GIVE ONE COMFORT. IN TERMS OF AN AUTHORITY TO MANAGE. I AM SORRY I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SERIOUS AND THINK OF THE BY CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE. BEFORE WE TURN IT OVER TO ASSN MEMBER CHIU INSIDE JENNIFER CLOSING COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL. LAST MINUTE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NINETY NINE WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR CURRENTLY IN THE MOTIONS BY CENTER WIENER THIS IS A DO PASSES A MINIATURE PREPARATIONS. MOTION. MR SIMILAR FOR SURE SURPLUS INCOME LET ME AGAIN VERY MUCH THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR IN DEPTH DISCUSSION A REFLECTION AND AGAIN I WANT VERY MUCH THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] AND AND I DON'T WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND IN THE ROLE OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC ROADS IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND PUBLICLY RUN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE. YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST FOCUS ON THIS AS IT STANDS. THIS IS A BILL ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD BE BETTER PUT TO USE. IF THEY COULD CONTROL IT THROUGH A LOCAL CHARTER PUBLIC BANK -- AND THIS IS ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT. THAT DO NOT THINK THAT THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS ARE ARE ARE SERVING THEM. THE OPPOSITION POINTED TO POLLING. SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW THAT'S DIFFERENT BUT I IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY HE REFERRED. TO CREDIT UNIONS AND AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE LARGEST WALL STREET BANKS TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY KERN SIMPLE. THIS BILL. WITH LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY SAYS WE DON'T WANT TO COMPETE IN THE LANES OF CREDIT UNIONS ARE COMMUNITY BANKS THAT ARE TRYING TO SERVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING INVESTED IN PLACES WHERE ARE COMMUNITIES DO NOT WANT TO BE INVESTED. AND NOT INVEST IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT SERVING US. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND JUST CLARIFY AND THIS IS BEEN SAID BEFORE BY NUMBER OF PARTIES BUT I THINK IT BEARS TO BE SAID BECAUSE I DO KNOW THERE'S SOME CONFUSION THE PUBLIC. THE LANGUAGE WE ARE TAKING AN AMENDMENT. WOULD REQUIRE -- THAT WE GO TO THE BALLOT BOX WITH REGARDS TO GENERAL LOST CITIES. AND US CITIES IT TAKE PART IN GPI GPAS BUT IT WOULD APPLY TO CHARTER CITIES BECAUSE THOSE CITIES ARE ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY. ON THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND WE DO NOT WANT TO UNDERMINE THAT -- AND THAT IS THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE WITH THE CHAIR HAS BEEN STATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. LET ME JUST SEND WITH THE FOLLOWING WHICH IS. WITH THIS BILL. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO SEND RECORD PROFITS. TO WALL STREET BANKS. TO CREATE LOCAL JOBS TO BUILD LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO STABILIZE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLIC'S. MONEY SHOULD SERVE A PUBLIC PURPOSE AND NOT MAXIMIZE PROFITS SHAREHOLDERS AND FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT THE SALMON MR CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I'LL BE BRIEF I A RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK FOR THE COMMITTEES IDOL AND I APPRECIATE. THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I AT ONE OF THE COMMITTEES RIGHT APPRECIATED THE ACTUAL BACK AND FORTH ON RULE POLICY ISSUES AND YOU KNOW I TAKE AWAY FROM THIS EVEN THOSE WHO WHO ARE NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTED THE DAY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A WEALTH OF INFORMATION. THAT YOU'VE LEARNED. THAT CAN HELP THIS TO BECOME A BETTER BILL MOVING FOR NIGHT AND I'D APPRECIATE THAT SORT OF CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK. I READ THE COMMENTS TO BE YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR OFF. IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF APPRECIATING THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND I APPRECIATE ARE YOU GOING TO THAT LENGTH EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT SUPPORT TODAY -- SO THAT WOULD WITH THAT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS -- DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN THIS ISSUE I REALLY DO -- OFTENTIMES YOU GET -- HEAVY DUTY BILLS AGO THROUGH COMMITTEE AND YOU DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE CHAIRS REALLY TAKEN THE TIME. TO DIG INTO THE WEEDS TO HOW LONG CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE LONG MEETINGS AND AND IT'S NOT LAS APPRECIATED.
