FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON STEELHEAD AND OTHER SPECIES. MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE FISH SPECIES ARE HIGHLY THREATENED DUE TO HABITAT LOSS AND DEGRADATION AS I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW. AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXACERBATING THESE THREATS WITH LONGER AND MORE FREQUENT DROUGHTS REDUCED SPRING FLOWS AND HIGHER SUMMER TEMPERATURES. THESE FUNDS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE URGENT WORK OF RESTORING THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIVER SYSTEMS TO HELP RECOVER THESE IMPERILED SPECIES.

MEMBERS QUESTIONS. WE HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM A. I DO ALFA ALEJO ANNUALLY- HAS SOME COMMENTARY ON THIS. GOOD MORNING THIS IS RACHEL EHLERS FROM THE L. A. O. MISTER CARE MEMBERS NICE TO SEE YOU ALL OF THE MAIN QUESTION WE HAVE ON THIS ISSUE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS REALLY HOW MUCH DISCRETION DO YOU WANT TO DEFER TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THESE FUNDS AND HOW MUCH GUIDANCE DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BOND IS REALLY VERY HIGH LEVEL AND AB THE BUDGET BUILT A PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL SO YOU COULD CONSIDER ADDING LANGUAGE REQUIRING A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM YOU COULD CONSIDER ADDING LANGUAGE. WRITING PROVIDING SOME PLANNERS AROUND HOW YOU WANT THAT COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO BE SCHEDULED TO BE APPLE ORIENTED WHAT PRIORITIES WHAT- AREAS OF FOCUS- AND ADDITIONALLY THE BOND ALSO ALLOWS THESE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR FIVE SPECIFIC STATEWIDE OBLIGATIONS THOSE ARE THE SOLVENCY THE LAKE TAHOE-CONTACT KLAMATH DAM COMPACT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT AND THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER RESTORATION PROGRAM. SO YOU COULD ALSO ALLOCATE SOME AMOUNT OF THIS FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE PRIORITIES THREE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SO- REALLY I THINK THE MAIN MESSAGE WE WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS HOW MUCH PRIORITIZATION DO YOU CARE ABOUT WITH THESE FUNDS AND HOW MUCH GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION. DO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU. QUESTION. I'D LIKE TO ASK A- I GUESS IT WOULD BE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID. WHY ARE THESE- OF FUNDS NOT ALLOCATED THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. SURE GOOD MORNING TERROR IN OUR BORDERS AB RENTAL APARTMENTS- WE KNOW OKAY AT AT AT THIS POINT TIME AFTER RESOURCE AGENCY IN IT DOESN'T TEND TO ALLOCATE THESE FUNDS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM- TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE REQUESTED ON pON POSSIBLE REGIONAL LANGUAGE AS AS THE ONLY- MENTIONED HAPPY. TO FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF TO DISCUSS THE- GREAT THAT SAID TO A- FOR ME TO READ. EVERYONE THAT- WE WILL BE TAKING VOTES ON THESE ISSUES TODAY SO CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE- AND THEY WILL BE INFORMED. BY BOTH THE STAFF REPORT- THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR STAFF- AND THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MAKE TODAY- SO- FIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR- A REPORTS ON- ISSUE NUMBER ONE. I WILL MOVE FURTHER FORWARD. IN TWO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS- THESE- HAVE VARIOUS OF A PROPOSES THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE. PLATE FUND. JUST BRING CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES THE ITEMS THAT ARE LISTED IN THE AGENDA USING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND. IN THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS- THE ADMINISTRATION HAD OUR LEGAL COUNSEL REVIEW- THESE USES OF THE LPF AND THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE APPROPRIATE AND GIVEN THAT THE SUPPORT IDENTIFIABLE PROJECTS PROGRAMS THE SPECIFIC COSTS THAT MEET THE PURPOSES LISTED IN THE ELP OF STATUTE. IN ADDITION THESE PROPOSALS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FUNDED IN THE PAST INCLUDING FUNDING THE BOLSA CHICA RESTORATION PROJECT IN THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. IN FUNDING FOR THE SAN DIEGO RIVER CONSERVANCY'S MAIN OPERATING COSTS SINCE ITS INCEPTION. AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE STAFF'S ASSESSMENT IN THE AGENDA THAT THE PROPOSAL SHOULD BE SHOULD BE FUNDED AND WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE- LMAO AVAILABLE. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRAND BROWN WITH ALEJO- YEAH WE IN LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED TWO ISSUES MOSTLY RELATED TO WHO- THE LARGEST THAT THE PROPOSAL'S NEW PROPOSAL FUNDED OUT OF YOUR CABINETS CAN DO- THE STATE DEPARTMENT FROM THE EXISTING NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDING TO THE NEW ONE THAT'S BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF THE COMMISSION DARDEN NUMBER ONE IT IS- MISTER CASH REFERENCE WE DID RAISE A CONCERN. ABOUT WHETHER THOSE OFF BETWEEN MAY BE CATEGORIZED IT PRIMARILY ADMINISTRATIVE ARE AN APPROPRIATE ALLOWABLE USE OF THE LPF WHICH IN STATUE HAS CERTAIN DESIGNATED PURPOSES SUCH AS FOR THAT RESTORATION PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AND- AND PUBLIC EDUCATION THE SECOND QUESTION THAT WE REYES WAS- WHERE I IDENTIFIED WAS SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND BE FINE CONDITION FOR. A YEAR L. P. F. AND THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE MEDICATION IS NOT YET CLOSE THE BOOKS ON THE PRIOR YEAR SO THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE STARTING POINT CONDITION IS- GOING INTO THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN ALSO- SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT RATHER THAN STATIC GIVEN THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THAT THAT WE'RE ALL FACING- SO GIVEN THESE TO YOU SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED TWO OPTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER- THE FIRST IS IT WOULD BE AN OPTION TO SIMPLY SWAP. THE LPF- AND FOR- FORTY EIGHT THAT CAN SO THAT ALLOW YOU FORGET TO GENERAL OF TO FUND THE- OTHER RESEARCH. THAT AND USED A SEMI AMOUNT OF THE LPF OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET THAT ARE CLEARLY- CONSISTENT WITH ALLOWABLE USES OF THE L. P. ARE CONCERNED EXAMPLE MIGHT BE. A FUNDING FOR PARKS DEFERED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN NET NEUTRAL- ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE FUNDING OF THE PROJECT BUT THEN ALSO WOULD HAVE- NO IF. ACT ON IT EMPF FOR GENERAL FUND IN TOTAL. I DON'T MEAN IT WOULD IT WOULD ALSO NOT HAVE- THE BENEFIT OF REDUCING THE L. P. UP COST IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINE CONDITION SO WE COULD ALSO OFFER A SECOND OPTION- IN THAT IT. IS TO. TAKE THE COST FOR THE NEW AND DEFER THOSE. UP ACROSS ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT SUPPORT THE RESOURCE AGENCY AN APARTMENT IN THE BUILDING. DO YOU TAKE THE FOUR AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN COST AND- AND IT YOU SPREAD THAT ACROSS- PRICE FOR THE TITLE FUND AS WELL AS THE GENERAL FUND-THAT WOULD HAVE BOTH THE BENEFIT OF REDUCING COSTS FROM THE LPF. AND THEN ALSO- WOULD HAVE A TRADE OFF THOUGH- IF YOU WOULD HAVE SOME MARGINAL INCREASES IN ONE TIME COSTS. FOR THOSE OTHER FINES. THE END THAT WE CAN GET IN THE- THE FACT THAT THAT FOUR AND A HALF MILLION. I IN MOST CASES THAT WOULD BE. MANAGEABLE BY THOSE FUNDS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THANK YOU. SELL IF I COULD GET THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BACK BOB CAN'T WALK WHY NOT- FOLLOW THE- A SUGGESTION OF THE L. A. O. ON THIS ISSUE THAT THAT- CONNECTIVE ITTY BETWEEN THE IDEAL PIAF AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT ARE FUNDED AND IN THAT IN THESE ITEMS IS TENUOUS. AT BEST- AND WE'VE HAD THIS ISSUE COME UP REPEATEDLY IN THE PAST. WHERE THE L. P. HALF IS- I THINK THAT YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT REALLY STRETCHES- THE ODDS OF THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSES THAT ARE RECOMMENDED TODAY- WHY NOT FROM THESE OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND OR DO THE KIND OF SWAP. THAT OF THE ALLEY- SUGGESTING. SURE YEAH BRAMBLE PARK LANDS AND BIG QUESTIONS M. AS IT RELATES TO. THE USE OF YOUR YEAH AS AS THE FUNDS SOURCE FOR THESE PROPOSALS IN IN YOUR SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT. THE SIMPSONS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE SUIT HM. I GUESS JUST STEPPING BACK A BIT ATHLETE MISTER CAPTAIN JAMES I'M THAT PART PART. OF THE DAY. BUDGET ON PROCESS THE MINISTRY EVALUATES. THESE WERE TO MAKE SURE THAT FUNDS SOURCES AND PROPOSED ACT ALIGNED WITH THE FOR GIVEN STATUTE THAT AND- AND THE STATUS OF AN- ADULT IT'S ABOUT FUN THE SUIT SOME FACTORS IT GOES AGAINST. YOU PROBABLY OF ALL SORTS CAST OF THE PHONE TO SUPPORT THE OFF THE PROBLEMATIC RACISM ON MONDAY THEN KIND OUR OVERALL BUDGET. AND SO. I JUST WANT TO YOU CAN SPEAK YOUR YEAH HAVING TO ASK TO SUPPORT OUR- MISTER BROWN WHICH IS. AND BEYEAH. NOT NOT YET CLOSING BACK ASK YOUR FOR YOU YEAH SENATE. PROVIDING. THE FUND BALANCE THAT. EVAN IS BEATING FASTER SAVING IN THAT RESPECT- BUT AGAIN THAT KIND OF YEAH IN MIND THE BROUGHT AT GENERAL FUND ENDING COVERED BY FRAMEWORK REALLY IT WILL BE INTENT TO PER AND- THAT ANY GIVEN THE CORPORATE. AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE. AND ECONOMIC- BUT BUT STILL. DEBTS DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT GENERAL ARE STILL SOME CONSTRAINTS ARE WHAT EFFECT. WHICH IS IN PART WHY THE NEW TURNS YELLOW YES IT A FUN THIS DIFFERENT ELIGIBLE. AND WHILE ALSO KEEPING MY THAT WE GET GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE SOME OF THESE OTHER PARTS OF THE QUESTION- OF. THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CONSTRUCTION AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE- MISTER CAPTAIN MENTION THAT. IDENTIFIES PRODUCTS PROGRAM OF THE ENTITIES THAT BEFELL. PROGRAMS THAT I CAN FIND STAFF SO AND IT IN THAT IT. GIVEN THAT BACKGROUND INFORMATION THE STAFF SUPPORTING PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED- WHAT TYPE OF WORK SUPPORTED BY APPLE. DID YEP AND. WELL I THOUGHT I FRANKLY DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE EXPLANATION BUT- IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE A HISTORY WITH THE L. P. HALF OF- THINKING OF IT AS A PART OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE TO- FILL THE GAP- AND IN THIS CASE- FILL THE GAP USES WHEN IT COMES TO ADMINISTRATION AN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS- WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY OVERRIDING STRATEGY FOR THEIR USE IT'S JUST THIS IS JUST LIKE OUT OF FUND THAT'S THERE. TO SPRINKLE MONEY AROUND IN THE BUDGET BUT WITHOUT ANY STRATEGIC PURPOSE. AB AND- I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO RE OF RETHINK THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE ON THIS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES MISTER BENNETT HAD. DESIGNATION OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS. THE HAS TO HAVE WANTED TO BE PROBABLY ON- NUMBER PROGRAMS OF THE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE TO THERE I GUESS. WELL WHY DON'T WE ASK THE OF- THE H. FOR L. A. THIS IS BRIAN CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LPF OF FUNDING PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS THAT- THE PROVIDE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES RESTORATION AND ALSO FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS- THE AGENCY PROVIDES A REPORT EVERY YEAR TO THE LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THE USES FOR THE FOR THE FUND AND- A REPORT WAS PROVIDED AT THE- BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR TO STAFF SHOWING HOW THE FUND WAS USED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT. ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND. SOME OF THE- FUNDING IS USED TO SUPPORT THE- STAFF COSTS FOR THE AGENCIES FOR ESPECIALLY FOR CONSERVANCIES- AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO DOES PROMOTE- ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ACQUISITION PROTECTION. AND OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE SUPPORTED IN THE YEP YEP YEP STATUTE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT- AND- MISTER SMITH YOU CHASE BURKE KIND OF THE SAME THING UP AS A NEW GUY UP HERE AND ACRONYMS I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS THE NRA I A NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY FOR ONE THING BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND SHOULD BE USED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THE MOVE IS A ONE TIME- COST. AND IT SHOULD COME OUT THE GENERAL FUND. SO- HOPE THE LMAO OF RECONSIDERS AT. FOR THE AGENCY THIS IS A MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAN- MIGHT SEEM ON THE SURFACE BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMEROUS SPECIAL FUNDS AND MANY OF THEM ARE TREATED THE SAME WAY- AND- ALASKA- ARE A COMMITTEE STAFF- NOT NOW BUT- IN BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT MEETING PERHAPS WE CAN BE INFORMED WHAT THOSE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS ARE- SO THAT WE START TO THINK ABOUT- HOW YOU CAN USE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE STRATEGICALLY. THE TIRE RECYCLING FEE IS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS HAPPENS- IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SO WE'RE GONNA- JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE GONNA HOLD PUBLIC COMMENT TO THE END OF THE HEARING SO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE COMMENT ON UP- ALL WE HAVE A RELATIVELY LIMITED- A CALENDAR THIS MORE SO I THINK- RATHER THAN GO. ONE BY ONE OF WE CAN JUST DO THEM ALL AT THE END. THE- OF THE ACT OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING. SO THAT THAT TAKES US TO ISSUE NUMBER. THREE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LAW OF LIFE- BIODIVERSITY ENHANCEMENTS FEATURED ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THE WILDLIFE HABITAT RESTORATION PUBLIC- AGREES FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. WE HAVE FOR A. TO THE BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE GOVERNOR. GOOD MORNING CHAIR THIS IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH A LOT OF BLOOD GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MISTER BOTTOM. YEAH I MISS YOU IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU I WISH I WAS SITTING EVERYONE IN PERSON IT'S A LITTLE BIT WEIRD DANIEL IN IT THIS WAY. YES AND IT MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT WEIRD- BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SEE. WITH THE CONFIRMATION OF YOUR STAFF WHETHER I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN. AND I WANT TO CONFIRM ONE THING WITH THE CHAIR GETTING I'M GETTING AND NODDING YES THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE SCREEN PHILIP. LET'S GO FOR IT. OKAY AND TO CONFIRM- I WOULD FIRST GIVE YOU A QUICK. EXHORTATION OF OUR SERVICE BASED BUDGET REPORTS AND THEN TURN TO OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. IS THAT- YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL YES. OKAY GREAT ME ONE SECOND SEE IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF. IT ARE YOU SEEING A SLIDE THAT IS THE INTRODUCTORY SLIDE REPORTS ARE NOW WE'RE SEEING YOUR INITIALS. OKAY IF THIS DOES NOT. WORK WE WILL SKIP. STILL JUST SAYING MY INITIALS OUT NOT- YOUR- OUR POINT IS UP ON THE SCREEN. PERFECT A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL UP PICTURES OF NATURE JUST WEST LIKE THIS WHAT WE LIKE TO DO FOR ME. THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PART OF MY DAY HAVING GOTTEN THROUGH THE SHARE SCREEN HERE SO. REAL QUICKLY- YOU'LL SEE ON THE SCREEN. THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION STATEMENT I HAPPEN TO THINK. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING VISIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND IT REALLY IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE EXCEPTIONALISM OF CALIFORNIA. ARE NATURE OF THE WEALTH OF OUR NATURE IS EXCEPTIONAL IN THE STATE. WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOREVER OUR INDIGENOUS PARTNERS NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HAVE KNOWN THAT SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. THAT NATURAL WEALTH FUELS ARE THRIVING ECONOMY AND THAT NATURAL WEALTH GIVES ASSISTANCE OF PLACE IN A SENSE OF PURPOSE IN THE SENSE OF IDENTITY. AS CALIFORNIANS. WE'VE BEEN ON A LONG JOURNEY YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS JOURNEY WITH US. YOU SET US IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THE MOST RECENT PHASE OF THIS JOURNEY WITH THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. YOU ASKED US TO GO COMPLETE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING THAT'S WHAT S. B. B. STANDS FOR WE HIRED THE NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM DELOITTE WHO HAS DONE THIS AROUND THE NATION. AND THE GOALS OF THE EFFORT YOU STATUS ON SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'RE TO ANALYZE THOSE FOUR ASPECTS. YOU SEE HERE DESCRIBED AS THE GOALS. SO MOVING TO THE- SLIDE. WE STARTED WITH THE RETHINKING WHO WE WERE WE CONVENED AN EXTERNAL IT VISOR COMMITTEE THAT IS A DIVERSE REPRESENTATION OF. PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ENGAGE WITH OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE REALIZED WE WERE EXPLAINING WHAT WE DO WELL ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE CONNECTED TO OUR DEPARTMENT. SO OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS WE STARTED WITH THE RE DESCRIBING OURSELVES AND ORGANIZING OURSELVES AROUND THE POOR SERVICES UC DESCRIBED IN THIS SLIDE USING PLAINER LANGUAGE SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE WHAT WE DO AND WHAT OUR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. AND THE RESULT OF THIS PROCESS REALLY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES WE CREATED AN INTERNAL TEAM EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP MYSELF THROUGH OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM. OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN ART IT'S A T. AND THEN WE DID TWO YEARS OF EXHAUSTIVE ANALYTICS WORKING WITH THE BOARD. WE BROUGHT THOSE EIGHT SERVICE AREAS INTO ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TASKS THAT WE DO TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES IN THOSE AREAS. WE NOW HAVE ON IT OR TO EXCEL SPREADSHEET THAT'S FOUR FIVE HUNDRED PAGES THE TRACKS EACH OF THESE TASKS WE WENT OUT AND SAW ALL OF THE DATA AROUND THE LABOR HOURS NEEDED. TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE TASKS TO ACHIEVE BOTH OUR MISSION AND THE LABOR HOURS RELATIVE TO OUR CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS ENDED AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS WE ANALYZED OUR TOP TEN MOST IMPORTANT COMPLICATED ONES. TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF HOW WE'RE USING THOSE FUNDS AND THE RELATIVE USE OF THOSE FUNDS BACK TO OUR TASKS OUR CURRENT SERVICE AND OUR MISSION LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND HERE'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SERVICE BASED BUDGETING YOU GET ON UP BILITY. TO QUANTIFY YOUR WORK WITHIN A PROGRAM AREA WHICH YOU SEE REFLECTED ON ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN HERE THE DARKER COLOR IS A DATA DRIVEN WAY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND YOUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. PAGE MARKED AGAINST THE TASKS YOU WERE DOING AT EIGHT LABOR OUR LEVEL AND THEN YOU GET A DATA DRIVEN WAY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR MISSION LEVEL. THE GAP BETWEEN YOUR CURRENT AND IF YOU WERE DOING ALL THE THINGS NECESSARY TO MEET YES SIGN. AND THEN WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS BUBBLE CELL ON THE SLIDE. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO RESPOND TO THE GAP THAT YOUR DAD IT ILLUSTRATES. YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR MISTER AND YOUR POLICIES YOUR MANDATES PERHAPS SOME OF THEM ARE OUTDATED SOME OF THEM COULD USE CLARIFICATION. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE INTERNAL YOU CAN SPARE CHIU NAVAL OF YOUR ORGANIZATION AND YOU COULD PUSH YOURSELF TO. CREATE YOUR OWN INTERNAL EFFICIENCIES. YOU CAN GO TO YOUR EXTERNAL PARTNERS AND THINK THROUGH. WAYS IN WHICH PARTNERSHIPS CAN OFFLOAD SOME OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY APPROPRIATELY AND DEAL WITH THE GAP. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT OF COURSE YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT LABOR AS A WAY TO COVER THAT GAP. IN HERE'S WHAT YOU FIND. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT'S ANALYSIS WHICH IS NOW BEING COMPLETED OVER TWO YEARS. WORKING WITH MOST OF YOUR STAFF ABROAD EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE GROUP. AND HERE IS- DATA DRIVEN REPRESENTATION OF THE FINES WE SUBMITTED OUR FINAL REPORT TO YOU LAST WEEK. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THAT REPORT AND THE FINDINGS FRANKLY IT'S NOT SURPRISING. ALL OF US HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME. THE DEPARTMENT'S ASSIGNMENTS ITS MANDATES ITS MISSIONS EXCEED ITS CAPACITY AND IT'S SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SUPPORT. IF YOU LOOK AT AND WHAT WE FILED WITH YOU LAST WEEK APPENDIX A- IS A LONG LIST OF ALL THE PRIOR REPORTS THAT HAVE TAKEN AND LOOK T THIS ISSUE THE FIRST REPORT IS NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. THAT REPORT SAYS UNFUNDED MANDATES ARE A PROBLEM. YOU THE LEGISLATURE OF ACTUALLY AMENDED OUR CODE TO EXPRESSLY SAY IN THE FISH AND GAME CODE THAT OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE. IS ARE UNDER FUNDED CAPACITY. AND HERE IS A VISUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE GAPS. WELL ON ONE SIDE YOU SEE WHERE THE GAP IS SMALLEST ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT THAT MAKES SENSE WE CHARGE INTERNALLY ACROSS ALL OF OUR SERVICE AREAS TO ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT IN THE MINISTRY OF SUPPORT. LOOKING JUST AT THAT THE 73% NUMBER. FIGURE INDICATES THE LEVEL OF SERVICE WORKERS PROVIDING AND THE 27% REPRESENTS THE GAP TO ACHIEVE THE MISSION LEVEL OF SERVICE AND IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. YOU'LL SEE WHERE OUR GAPS ARE LARGEST IN OUR SERVICE CURRENTLY IS THE LEAST RELATIVE TO OUR MISSION. ADD THIS TO WHILE FOR ME EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING IS SOMEWHAT NOT SURPRISING. THE GROWTH OF THE DEPARTMENT HISTORICALLY OVER TIME IN OUR MANDATES IS IT IN THIS ARENA. BESTIES OF HABITAT CONSERVATION WHEN YOU CONSIDER OUR TRADITIONAL ACTIVITIES WERE REALLY FOCUSED YOU KNOW FIFTY YEARS AGO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ON BUSTING THE HUNTER IN THE ANGLER THAT WAS POACHING ENFORCING HUNTING AND FISHING CODE. PROVISIONS NOW WE DO SO MUCH MORE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEN WE COULD HAVE CONTEMPLATED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO- WHEN THE BOARD OF FIFTIES COMMISSIONERS WAS CREATED. THESE CATEGORIES OVER ON THE FAR SIDE PERMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION I'VE ALSO BEEN MORE RECENTLY THE HISTORICAL AREAS HARDEST. TO FIND A SUSTAINABLE PERMANENT ONGOING FUND SOURCE FOR NEXT SLIDE AND THEN I'M DONE- TWO SLIDES THIS IS THE SAME. CHALLENGE PROBLEM NOW DESCRIBES FOCUSED ON HOURS OF LABOR. IT LAYS OUT ROUGHLY THIS SIMILAR ARE YOU GO ALL THE WAY OVER TO SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION YOU SEE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THERE. EVEN THOUGH THAT IS ACTUALLY AN ARENA WHERE WE'RE DOING THE MOST LABOR HOURS. THAT'S THE INFORMATION WHAT I THINK IS PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT. OUR DEPARTMENT HAS TURNED A CORNER WE'RE REALLY OLD INSTITUTION WE'RE TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY YOUR ASSIGNMENT GIVEN TO US FOR SERVICE BASED BUDGETING HAS REALLY ALLOWED US THE BUS A BIG PROBLEM WE HAD I DON'T THINK HISTORICALLY WE'VE BEEN TRANSPARENT. I DON'T THINK HISTORICALLY WE'VE BEEN DATA DRIVEN AND THIS TWO YEAR EFFORT HAS ALLOWED US TO BECOME SUCH MORE TRANSPARENT AND OPEN ABOUT OUR DATA WORKING WITH YOU AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE. THESE ARE THE FINDINGS HERE WHICH I JUST MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO AS A GENERAL MATTER OUR CURRENT STAFFING IS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOMPLISH ABOUT 36% OF OUR MISSION LEVEL NEEDS. NOW THIS IS NOT A ONE TIME ENDEAVOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT. MY LAST SLIDE HERE ABOUT DATA ANALYTICS. YOU'VE TOLD US TO DO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING WE'VE ACTUALLY INSTITUTIONALIZED. I'VE HEARD A FULL TIME DATA MANAGER. EVERY YEAR WE WILL UPDATE THIS INFORMATION THAT I'VE JUST PRESENTED TO YOU TO REFRESH THE CURRENT SERVICE LETTER DATA. EVERY FIVE YEARS WE WILL UPDATE THE MISSION LEVEL DATA. INSTANTANEOUSLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND YOUR BUDGET STAFF TO PRODUCE VISUALS LIKE THIS. WE'VE TRAINED ALL OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT LEADERS ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT. THAT THIS IS OUR NEW TOOL IT'S OUR NEW WAY OF ORGANIZING OUR INSTITUTION. AT A MINIMUM WHILE WE STILL HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US WE'VE CHANGED THE CULTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF Y'ALL'S INSTRUCTION. YOUR YOUR TO TAKE US ON THIS JOURNEY. SO SURE LET ME STOP THERE. THAT'S THE PRESENTATION. AND LET ME SEE IF I CAN SEGUE BACK OVER TO MY FACE. PURPOSES OF WHEN WE TRANSITION TO THE B. C. P. AND PARTS OF THIRTY QUESTIONS ON THE PRESENTATION PART. YEAH- HI I'M GONNA CALL YOU IN A SECOND MISTER BENNETT BUT- IF YOU DON'T MIND BUT- I WON A LEAD WITH- I SENT SOME COMMENTS- MR BONHAM- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS THE RESULTS COME AS NO SURPRISE BUT THE- WAY OF LAID OUT THE- THE FINDINGS AND THE STRUCTURE. AROUND THEM- I THINK IS VERY VERY HELPFUL- YOU HAVE- USE THE WORD SAID THAT- YOU'VE TURNED THE CORNER AND- I HAVE TO SAY I DON'T I DON'T THINK SO- BECAUSE- OF KNOWING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION NOW IN ORDER TO REALLY TURN THE CORNER WE NEED TO NOW- YOU KNOW HOW YOU ADDRESS THESE VERY VERY SERIOUS FUNDING GAPS. AND WHILE THE RECOMMENDATIONS- ADJUSTED TO A ONE TIME FUNDING CAN- HELP ADDRESS AT LEAST TEMPORARILY SOME OF THESE GAPS THE REAL SOLUTION AS- FINDING FUNDING OUR ONGOING BASIS TO ADDRESS THE GAPS AND ON THAT ISSUE. THERE'S I'M NOT LETTING THIS AT YOUR DOORSTEP NECESSARILY- DIRECTOR BONHAM- BUT YOU'RE THE DIRECTOR- I I'VE JUST A LITTLE BIT DUMBFOUNDED HERE THAT THERE IS LIKE NO PROPOSAL THERE IS NO SUGGESTION ABOUT WHAT FOLLOWS- SO THAT WE GET TO A PLACE- WHERE YOU'RE VERY. IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT WITH A THAT ADDRESSES SO MANY IMPORTANT NEEDS AND THE STATE GETS THE FUNDING THAT IT DESERVES AND- THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVEN THIS PROCESS FROM THE GET GO AS THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THE FUNDING. ISN'T THERE WE'VE TRIED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- APPROACHES TO A WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO PROVIDING THAT FUNDING- BUT IT- IS A VERY SURPRISING TO ME THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY AND SAID OKAY NOW WE KNOW WHERE THE GAPS ARE- AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE MUCH MORE. EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS. SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YOU HAVE OKAY I'M SORRY I'M HAVING A HARD TIME ON MY END WITH THE CAPITAL IF IT AT THE ENTIRE AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU BUT THE PRIOR PRESENTATION WITH A LITTLE BIT FAINT- AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO- TO HEAR IT'S TIME SO- WE WON'T THINK YOU'RE YELLING AT US IF YOU GO A LITTLE. SO WHEN I MENTIONED ROUNDING THE CORNER CORNER LET ME LET ME VERY MUCH FOCUSED THAT AND WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT WE HAVE BEEN BRACED THE SERVICE BASED BUDGET IDEA THE INSTRUCTION TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT TO REALLY GET GRANULAR ON WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE DO IT THE DATA DRIVEN APPROACH THAT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT WITH ROUND THE CORNER I KNOWLEDGE I STIPULATE AND I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION ABOUT WHERE'S THE SOLUTION AND I AM VERY MUCH PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY TO THE EXTENT I CAN AS WE SEGUE INTO THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- THAT'S THE NEXT PART OF MY ISSUE AN AGENDA ITEM TODAY GREAT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IT AND MR BANNON HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER- MR BONHAM- I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR GO INTO THE DETAIL RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. ASK YOU TO HAVE HAVE YOUR STAFF- REPAIR THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION YOUR BOTTOM TWO CATEGORIES WHICH IS SPECIES. CONSERVATION AND THEN THE PERMITTING- CATEGORIES ARE. CATEGORIES THAT YOU'RE HAVING THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH I WOULD LIKE TO GET. SOME KIND OF ANALYSIS OF JUSTIN WHAT ARE THE MAJOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT HAPPENING THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING- NEED TO HAPPEN IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES- WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDS TO BE DONE- AND IS NOT HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN. PERHAPS BRING THAT ALIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE- FOR US SO I WITHOUT IT TAKING A MORE TIME HERE JUST WILL ALERT YOU THAT LIKE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO PROVIDE THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT WE'D BE GLAD TO- AND THAT IS A BENEFIT OF THIS PROCESS WE'VE GONE THROUGH WE CAN ACCESS THAT DATA MUCH MORE READILY. AND PROVIDED BASED ON QUESTIONS LIKE THE ONE YOU JUST. ASKED THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND BEFORE YOU PROCEED INTO THE NEXT PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION I WANT TO WELCOME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WHO- DOESN'T NEED TO BE HERE BUT- AS THE- A NEWLY APPOINTED VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- IS AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF. OF THE STUFF COMMITTEE. HELLO I HAVE OBSERVED- BEFORE THAT- MR FONG'S FOLLOWING MR OBERNOLTE- AT THE A BUDGET COMMITTEE MEANS THAT- OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS THE FEEDER COMMITTEE FOR A- VICE CHAIR POSITION OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND- THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN BE VERY PROUD OF BUT IT'S GOOD TO SEE MR FONG. DIRECTOR BOND BACK TO YOU. GREAT SO NOW TURNING TO OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU THIS MORNING I BELIEVE. DOES RELATE TO MY EARLIER PRESENTATION FIRST THIS STATE IS SO EXCEPTIONAL I LOVE IT. AND THE REASON WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH AND IT'S SO EXCEPTIONAL IS THE WEALTH OF OUR NATURE OUR PLANTS AND OUR ANIMALS WE HAVE MORE TYPES OF THOSE PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. THE FACT WE HAVE MORE PLANTS THAT ARE FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE GLOBE. THEN ALMOST ALL THE OTHER STATES COMBINED. THAT IS WHAT BIODIVERSITY MEANS IT'S YOUR WEALTH OF NATURE. AND WHAT YOU SEE TODAY IS A PROPOSAL TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INVESTMENTS INTO OUR DEPARTMENTS WHICH HONOR THAT EXCEPTIONALISM. THESE INVESTMENTS ALLOW US TO BECOME MORE CLIMATE RESILIENT THEY ALLOWS TO MODERNIZE ITS MANY OF THE THINGS WE DO AND THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ARE A WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN START TO CHIP AWAY AT THE GAP BETWEEN YOUR SERVICE LEVEL IN YOUR MISSION REQUIREMENTS. SO THE PROPOSAL IS FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FORTY ONE FORTY TWO MILLION OF THAT IS ONE TIME INVESTMENT FROM THE GENERAL FUND ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR THREE POINT THREE MILLION. OF THAT IS A REDIRECTION OF PROPOSITION TWELVE FUNDING. NOW IT'S ON WISE FOR ME IS DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT EVER REJECT ONE TIME FUNDS WHEN THEY'RE OFFERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE NEED THEM. THE L. A. O. OFFICE REPORT ON THIS ITEM CONCLUDES IT'S A PRUDENT AND REASONABLE THING TO DO. USE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO MAKE CHANGE TO REDUCE YOUR GAP. SHARE I ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS NOT THE FULL LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION I JUST SPEAKING PERSONALLY AS DIRECTOR HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO THE DRUG THROUGH OR GONE THROUGH I'VE WORKED WITH YOU ALL TO RAISE FEES ON CERTAIN SECTORS. RAISING FEES ON COMMERCIAL FISHING WAS PARTICULARLY BRUTAL AT A MOMENT IN TIME. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN PROPOSALS TO UTILIZE THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO SOLVE THE DEPARTMENTS LONG TERM FUNDING. NEEDS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN RE PURPOSING CAL TIRED RECYCLE FUNDS FOR THE SAME NEED. L. LAST YEAR SOME OF THESE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS I'M PROPOSING TODAY. ACTUALLY HAD TO BE TABLE BECAUSE OF THE REMARKABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION WE EXPERIENCE IN MAY OF LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF COVERT. SO HERE'S HOW WE WOULD USE THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT. WE WILL TAKE ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE WOULD FAST INTO THE SPACE OF HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS. WE GOT ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND BEARS AND MOUNTAIN LIONS AND OTHER ANIMALS EACH YEAR. WE CAN INVEST IN DOING THINGS LIKE CONSTRUCTING MORE TRAPS FOR MOUNT LINES SO THAT WHEN WE CAPTURE AMOUNT LANDED SEDATED IN SOMEONE'S BACKYARD IN LOS ANGELES. WE CAN'T RESPOND MORE QUICKLY AND MOVE THAT ANIMAL BACK INTO THE WILDERNESS WE WOULD TAKE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND PURCHASED A NEW FIXED WING AIRCRAFT. WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN PLANES ALL OF THEM DATE TO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AN ADDITIONAL PLANE WOULD BE A PRUDENT INVESTMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR WORK FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE FLYING ALONG THE COAST. MONITORING THE MIGRATION OF WHALES SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE OUR DUNGEON THIS CRAP FISHERY IN WALES AND AVOID INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO DYNAMICS. WE TAKE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND WE MODERNIZE OUR FISH HATCHERIES A GOOD EXAMPLE IS. WE CURRENTLY USE A LOT OF STAFF HOURS TO REMOVE DEAD ACHES FROM THE HATCHERY FISH BY HAND TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF FUNGUS TO LIVE X. CONVERTED TO EXHORTING AUTOMATED MACHINES WILL MANAGE OUR STAFF HOURS BETTER. AND ALLOW US TO SHRINK. THAT GAP IN THAT SERVICE AREA. FROM THERE WE TAKE ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE- MODERNIZE HOW WE MANAGE OUR OWN STATE WILDLIFE AREA WETLANDS WE HAVE A LOT OF OUTDATED DIESEL PUMPS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE OUT TO THEM AND START THEM. WE'RE FINDING IN SOME PLACES WHEN WE CONVERT THAT OPERATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO SOLAR ARRAYS. WE REDUCE OUR CLIMATE FOOTPRINT. AND WE AUTOMATE OUR SYSTEM AND WE CAN MANAGE OUR WETLANDS RESPONSIVE TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVEORDER AND DASH EIGHTY TWO DASH TWENTY. WHICH IS GOING TO BE REALLY RELEVANT FOR THE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE DIVERSITY WORK THE MANAGER ON STATE LANDS FOR BIODIVERSITY BENEFITS. WE TAKE ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND COMPLETE IN THE NORTH COAST. SOMETHING WE COMPETITION MAPPING THIS PRODUCES MULTIPLE BENEFITS IT'S THE DATA SETS INDUSTRY RELIES ON WEDNESDAY SITE PROJECTS TO GO THROUGH PERMITTING. AND IT'S ALSO THE BIOLOGICAL DATA SET TO DETERMINE WHAT IS CONSERVED IN THE STATE AND WHAT MIGHT BE CONSERVING. RELATIVES OF THE THIRTY BY THIRTY ASSIGNMENT. WE TAKE FOUR POINT MILLION DOLLAR DOLLARS AND WE- PURCHASE A SPECIALLY MADE LARGE OFFSHORE PATROL VESSEL FOR OUR MARINE LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK. ALONG THE COAST WE TAKE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND ANOTHER AMOUNT OF ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE PROP TWELVE. AND WE WOULD SPEND IT ON OUR OWN PROPERTIES TO INCREASE THE USE OF OUR PROPERTIES FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. FRANKLY WE'VE DOT DONE A GREAT JOB OF THAT HISTORICAL. WE HAVE PROPERTIES THAT ARE NEAR AND PROXIMITY TO LARGE URBAN AREAS WE HAVEN'T INTRODUCED OUR PROPERTIES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE INTEND TO ENGAGE WITH OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS. AND USE THESE LANDS AS A PATHWAY TO EDUCATE AND OUTREACH TO PARTS OF CALIFORNIA OUR DEPARTMENT TYPICALLY IS SERVING AND NEEDS TO DO BETTER AT SERVING. AND THEN FINALLY WE USE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MODERNIZE. THE PLATFORMS OF OUR REGULATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR HUNTERS AND ANGLERS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE AWAY FROM- OF THE PAPER OLD SCHOOL APPROACH AND TO THE ABILITY TO PUT ALL THIS INFORMATION ON MOBILE A ACCESSIBLE YOUR DIGITAL PLATFORMS FOR BOTH THE BENEFIT OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD AND THE CUSTOMER OF THE HUNTER AND- THE ANGLER. THAT'S WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW. SHARE I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LARGER ISSUE. ALSO ON THE CALL SERGIO AGUERO AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU CAN HELP FEEL BILLS AS WELL. THANK YOU- AND YOU'RE RIGHT AND I DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND I THINK IT BOILS DOWN TO A CONCERN I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM PERSONALLY- AT LEAST A- YOU KNOW THIS ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OF FINES ALL OF THE PROPOSALS THAT YOU'RE MAKING FOR IT- THESE EXPENDITURES ALL THE PROJECTS ARE VALUABLE. HI YOU STARTED OUT TO- WITH WELL MIGRATION AND- OF THE CONFLICT WITH THE DENTIST SO- CRAB SEASON AND THAT AS YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE WORKED ON TOGETHER AS YOU KNOW PERSONALLY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BUT ALL OF THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU PROPOSED TO FUND. ACT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES- WHAT GOES ON SAID IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS THE- LONG TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT OUT IN. IN VERY BROAD RELIEF- THROUGH THE REPORT THAT- THAT YOU COMMISSIONED AND RECEIVED. AND YOU KNOW FOR THAT- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING AND SO OFTEN COURAGE YOU TOO WHEN- WHEN YOU COME BACK UP PROVIDE US WITH A AND ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROVIDE US WITH A PLAN FOR HOW WE WILL GET TO A PLACE WHERE ALL OF THE- GAPS ARE. ARE MADE UP AND FUNDED THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING- I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO PROVIDE THAT TO US HERE TODAY I WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR IT TO HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO- SUGGESTED IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO US FOR US TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOT- NEXT SESSION OR- YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. I DON'T LOOK I'VE I'VE ONLY GOT A COUPLE YEARS LEFT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T WANT MY SUCCESSORS TO BE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND SAYING WELL YOU GOT THIS REPORT BACK AND- YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND THE VERY CLEARLY REQUIRED YOU TO BE THINKING ABOUT NEW FUNDING SOURCES AND- I FOUND THAT REPORT ON MY SHELF FOR SCOUT BUNCH OF DUST ON IT NOTHING EVER. YOU KNOW NOTHING EVER TRANSPIRED NONE OF US WANT O BE IN THAT POSITION AND SOLID ASK YOU TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THAT TO- WHEN- NEXT WE MAY- AND THE- I ONE WHICH IS WHERE. THE ONLY ONE WHO'S- A GRAB THE MIKE HERE- ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY YES MISTER BOND. LOOK SPEAKING PERSONALLY I. I FEEL SIMILARLY I HAVE BEEN DIRECTOR NOW THEY TELL ME LONGER THAN ANYONE HAS EVER BEEN DIRECTOR OF THIS DEPARTMENT. AND I BELIEVE VERY MUCH JANET. AND I'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE U. AS LEADERS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE. I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS INSTITUTION I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. HERE'S THE CONUNDRUM. FRANKLY THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T FEED ITSELF OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE NO INDIVIDUAL SECTOR COULD CARRY SUCH A FEE LOAD. AND THE GENERAL FUND ITSELF IS. A VERY IMPORTANT FUND FOR SO MANY PURPOSES ACROSS GOVERNMENT. AND. IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT MIGHT BE AN ADDITIVE SUSTAINABLE PERMANENT FUND SOURCE. TO ANSWER MR BENNETT'S QUESTION EARLIER ONE OF THE THINGS WE SEE AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SPECIES CONSERVATION THAT'S A GREAT NEED AS OUR ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROGRAM. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS YOU ALL KNOW IN FRONT OF YOU IS A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE THIRTY POSITIONS AND- ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S ONGOING FUNDING THAT'S PERMANENT RESPONSIBILITY AND TODAY GIVEN COVERT AND OTHER THINGS ONE OF THE APPROACHES FOR THIS CURRENT BUDGET WAS TO FOCUS IN ON ONE TIME. CHAIR I'M COGNIZANT THAT MICELLAR IS IN THE L. A. RECOMMENDS I COME BACK IN MAY WITH CONCRETE SOLUTIONS FOR THE LONG TERM AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO YOUR WORDS VERY MUCH. RESONATE WITH ME THEY MATTER AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR DIRECTION. THANK YOU- DIRECTOR ART ARE TIMES- HERE HAVE ROUGHLY COINCIDED WITH ONE OTHER- AND- HI THERE ARE VERY FEW LEADERS IN THE STATE FOR WHOM I HAVE MORE RESPECT THAN YOU AND- I THINK YOU KNOW- THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED A VERY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP AND SO IT IS. IN THAT SPIRIT THAT I FEEL- PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT FREER WITHOUT MY COMMENTARY THAN I MIGHT OTHERWISE WOULD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE PLACE THAT IT COMES FROM- WE WANT YOUR DEPARTMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE VERY IMPORTANT GOALS THAT THE THAT WE HAVE FOR IT- AND WE JUST. OVER THE YEARS THIS IS NOTHING NEW OVER THE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THERE AND- I THINK THIS IS AN INFLECTION POINT IT'S A TIME WHERE WE ARE- OKAY YOU KNOW THINGS ARE TOUGH IN THE STATE- BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED- AND WE CAN THINK THIS THROUGH. AND COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED AND THE SOLVE MOST IF NOT ALL OF THOSE STRUCTURAL. ISSUES- SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN. YES AND WITHOUT- A LESSER A COMMENTS- WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR. MISTER CHAIR RACHEL IT WAS FROM LA- SOME VERY BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE- DID WE PASS YOU BY MS HOLLERS AND SORRY. THE GREAT. RIGHT AWAY. COMMENTS ON FIRST AROUND THE- PACKED WE IT'S REASONABLE THE DEPARTMENT IS PROVIDED THE JUSTIFICATION FOR EACH OF THE EXPENDITURES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S THE ONLY APPROACH THAT YOU COULD TAKE YOU COULD TAKE A DIFFERENT- MIX OF ACTIVITIES THAT AREN'T PROPOSED INCLUDING SOME THAT MIGHT FOCUS MORE DIRECTLY ON THE SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AREA YOU CAN ALSO EVEN PICK WITHIN THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN PLACE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE I DID GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FUNDING TO THE VEGETATION MAPPING WHICH REALLY DOES GET SPECIFICALLY AT THAT SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION ACTIVITY. UNLESS IN ANOTHER AREA OF THE SECOND COMMENT AROUND THE SMALLEST PIECE OF THE PACKAGE THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR FISHING AND HUNTING LICENSE MODERNIZATION SEEMS LIKE A WORTHWHILE ACTIVITY BUT IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE AN ACTIVITY THAT COULD VERY JUSTIFIABLY BE FUNDED BY FEES FROM HUNTERS AND ANGLERS SINCE THEY ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE ACTIVITIES SO- WE RECOMMEND YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AND SEE IF THERE IS OTHER FEE REVENUE THAT COULD BE USED IN LIEU OF GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THAT ACTIVITY OR AT LEAST PART OF THAT ACTIVITY- IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO ADOPT BEFORE THE END OF THE- BUDGET. DISCUSSIONS AND THEN FINALLY A THIRD POINT IS REALLY WHAT WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN ALREADY REALLY ENCOURAGING THIS BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE SYSTEM OF ALL I'M GOING PLAN AND WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION GOING TO BRING FORTH SO SUGGESTING MAYBE IN SUBSEQUENT HEARINGS- BECOME PARK WITH A PLAN FOR HOW THEY'VE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB DEFINING THE PROBLEMS IN THIS- THAT SERVICE BIG BUDGET REPORT. SO WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS. THANK THE YOU VERY MUCH. A AGAIN FOR A- NOT- CALLING ON YOU. I MUST BE A LITTLE BIT RUSTY. AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS FORMAT- OF. YOU ALL ON VIDEO. I SEE YOU ALL ON VIDEO- NOT MY FAVORITE. FOR- BUT I'LL GET YOU RIGHT HERE AT THE- YEP. THE THIRD DRIVER NUMBER THIRTY I GOVERNOR PART OF FINANCE I JUST IF I CAN MAKE A COUPLE OF JUST A BRIEF COMMENT AS WELL HAPPY AND CLOAK. YES WE KNOW THIS PROPOSAL DOES MAXIMIZE THE USE OF ONE TIME THE GENERAL FUND THE AS THE DIRECTOR DID MENTION TO HELP SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY PROCESS IMPROVEMENT EQUIPMENT I REALLY. I'D YOU KNOW MORE PARTITION FEES AND ACTIVE WAYS OF- YOU'RE DOING CORRECTIVE NEEDS WITHIN EXISTING. STAFF RESOURCE LEVELS AND REALLY DO HELP TO STAR ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE GAPS WE DON'T THINK KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS. A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THE ON GOING- FUNDING AND AN ADDITIONAL YOUR AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO WHILE ALSO LOOKING INTO WAYS TO. CONTINUE MAXIMIZING EXISTING RESOURCES WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT WILL. THE- KIND AN APPROACH IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT PROVIDED BY THE DIRECTOR- YOU KNOW ONE THING I WOULD LIKE NO TWO IS. YOU KNOW COUPLE YEARS AGO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE THIRD BIG BUDGET REPORT WAS IT WAS MANDATED BOB YOU KNOW WE HAD PROVIDED SOME LIMITED TERM FUNDING THAT WAS SET TO EXPIRE THIS YEAR. AND LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY PERMANENTLY EXTENDED THE TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH IS KIND OF ANOTHER ONGOING INVESTMENT GIVEN THE INITIAL DATA WE HAD LAST YEAR HER OBSERVERS BASED BUDGET WE ALREADY KIND OF MADE A YOU KNOW INITIAL ONGOING INVESTMENT. THIS ADDITIONAL ONE TIME INVESTMENT YOU KNOW CONTINUES TO HELP ADDRESS THAT GAP- AND ACKNOWLEDGING WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE- THE TABLE FUNDING ISSUE- YOU KNOW. WHATEVER YOU TAKE YOUR REQUEST BACK ON ON B. YOU KNOW ALTERNATIVE THIS OUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AT THIS POINT NOT SURE IF WE COMMIT TO HAVING EVERYTHING YOU KNOW WE'RE YOU KNOW FINE TUNED AND READY FOR THAT BUT. WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE YOUR REQUEST BACK. THANK YOU- THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT PASSIVE. TO ME- I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY. YOU GUYS NEED TO HELP THE US DEPARTMENT. OF A BECOME FULLY FUNDED AND ET ON ITS FEET. SO THAT IT CAN FULLY CARRY OUT ITS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MISSION FOR THE STATE. I CAN'T TO EMPHASIZE HOW STRONGLY I FEEL ABOUT THAT I THINK OF THE SUB COMMITTEE JOINS ME IN THAT REGARD. AND I'D JUST LIKE TO- ENCOURAGE YOU AS- AS MUCH AS I CAN TO NOT THINK ABOUT THIS. AS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE PUT OFF INTO THE FUTURE BUT THAT WE NEED TO. ADDRESS IN A FAR MORE SUBSTANTIVE MANNER THAN- AT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. DOES AT THE PRESENT TIME. THANK YOU. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IS- SIGMA THE US A STABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KARLEY FAMOUS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- THAT IS REQUESTING THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR- TO SUPPORT OUR GRANT PROGRAM- THAT CAN ENABLE. PROJECTS AND- IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS- FROM THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS- YOU MAY RECALL THAT- SIGMAR REQUIRED THESE BASINS THAT HAVE A LEGACY OVER OVER DRAFTED NOT THAT TO THAT CATEGORY OF A CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED. TO PROVIDE THEIR PLANS TO THE DEPARTMENT- IN JANUARY OF- THE PREVIOUS- THIS YEAR AND WE NOW HAVE TO HEAR TO ABOUT FOR PLANS WERE THAT THE VALUATION ON- THOSE. GROUNDWATER AGENCIES ARE IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS. SO THE REQUESTED TO PROVIDE FUNDING- FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT COULD INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS THAT WILL INCREASE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY THE PLANNING AND DESIGN OF THOSE PROJECTS THOSE CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE STORM WATER CAPTURE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE A RECYCLED WATER. LOCAL CONVEYANCE- TO MOVE WATER FROM POINT A TO POINT B. ALSO STUDIES THAT WILL ADDRESS- REALLY IMPORTANT DATA GAPS THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED THUS FAR- AND COULD INCLUDE THE INSTALLATION OF MONITORING WELLS- AND OTHER EFFORTS THAT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN THIS INITIAL ROUND OF. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL MAY HAVE. QUESTIONS. I JUST ONE FOR ME AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE STAFF REPORT TO- WHY DOES THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SO BUT WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR TO BE AN EARLY ACTION. SURE SO- OUR LAB JUST FOR REPORTS ON OUR OUR LAST ROUND OF GRANTS WE HAD ACCELERATED PROP SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS- WE HAD TWENTY SIX MILLION- AVAILABLE FOR- FOR THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED GROUNDWATER BASINS WE HAD ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION- IN PROPOSALS SO. YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN DO THE MATH AND UNDERSTAND THE DEFICIT BETWEEN AVAILABLE FUNDING IN NEED- IF WE- GET THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR WE ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD TAKE US- ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- RATHER FOUR MONTHS AFTER ITS APPROPRIATION. TO PUT OUT THE PROJECT SOLICITATION PROPOSAL AND THAT PUTS US AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WHICH COINCIDES WITH OUR FINAL DECISIONS ON THESE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AND IT ENABLES- PARTIES TO START IMPLEMENTING RIGHT AWAY SO THAT WOULD PUT US- MISTER CHAIR AND- A YEAR FROM NOW ESSENTIALLY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHEN THOSE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES WOULD BE UNDER CONTRACT AND ABLE TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO START IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION. MR ABOUT. BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT IS JUST FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT- YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORING THESE PLANS AND- WITH THE TWENTY YEAR TIME HORIZON THAT THEY HAVE TO BRING THE PLANS AGAIN TO- COMPLIANCE- I. AM CONCERNED THAT. YOU HAVE THAT WE HAVE REALISTIC PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF NEW WATER SOURCES AND THIS GRANT TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DEVELOP NEW WATER SOURCES UP SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT- AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THAT TRY TO BRIEF US IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENSURE BECAUSE THERE'S TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE THERE TO HAVE UNREALISTIC PROPOSALS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY CUTBACKS YOU CAN JUST SAY HEY YEAH WE'RE OVER DRAFTING NOW BUT WE'RE GONNA GET ALL THIS NEW WATER AND IN A WHILE AND SO WE ARE DOING. WHAT WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE DOING AND IT IS THERE SHOULD THERE BE SOME SOME FUNDING SET ASIDE TO MAKE SURE- THAT WERE BEING REALISTIC OR HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS UP TO BE REALISTIC. THE SECOND THING IS SOME OF THESE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES ARE USING WATER MARKETS AND WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE PROVIDING ANY GUIDANCE TO MAKE SURE WATER MARKETS ARE NOT BEING USED- TO DISADVANTAGE- SOME COMMUNITIES DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS SIX CENTER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SHALLOWER WELLS- BOOK MY BIGGEST QUESTION IS. JUST THE WHOLE ISSUE WE'VE HAD SOME SOME STARK- AND A TRAGIC EXAMPLES OF DRINKING WATER- AND THIS ADVANCE COMMUNITIES REALLY BEING PUT AT GREAT DISADVANTAGE- BECAUSE THEIR WELLS WENT DRY WALL PEOPLE WERE OVER DRAFTING NOT VERY FAR AWAY- IS IT APPROPRIATE- AND MY QUESTION IS BOTH FOR DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. AND THE STATE WATER. CONTROL BOARD THERE ARE NEXT. HERE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF PROTECTING THOSE PRECIOUS DRINKING WATER SOURCES- IN THIS GROUND LARGEST INABILITY PLANNING PROCESS- IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR ENGAGING. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE THEY HAVE- STRONG REPRESENTATION AT THE TABLE- BOTH IN THE SAID THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PLANS BUT THAT THE PLANS AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOME INCENTIVES IN THE- SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU ASK FOR- PLANS THAT TAKE INTO SPECIAL CONSIDERATION OR MAKE SPECIAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE DRINKING WATER FOR THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS TO SORT OF IN A GENERAL BROUGHT IT THE GENERAL CATION I KNOW YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THOSE RIGHT NOW BUT THOSE ARE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE FOR THE- FOR THE DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. SO CERTAINLY. MAYBE I'LL TAKE. YOUR LAST QUESTION FIRST- WE ARE VERY AWARE OF- THE HEIGHTENED CONCERNS IN THE VERY JUSTIFIABLE CONCERNS. THAT- THE GROUNDWATER PLANS WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE DRINKING WATER QUALITY- PARTICULARLY FOR DOMESTIC WELLS AND IN PARTICULAR- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THE DEPARTMENT IS COORDINATING BEING IN A VERY INTENSIVE WAY AROUND OUR PLAN REVIEW AND- HOW- THESE PLANS FROM CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS INTERFACED WITH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER- INITIATIVE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PUTTING UNDUE BURDEN ON THAT PROGRAM. AND THAT ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF SIX MONTHS AS IT RELATES TO OUR DOMESTIC WELLS AS ONE OF SEVERAL BENEFICIAL USES ARE ARE ADDRESSED SO- THERE ARE REALLY SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS REVIEW OF. THE PLANS AND ITS ABILITY TO ESTABLISH CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND- INCENTIVIZE AND WORK WITH THE LOCAL GSA'S TO- ENABLE THEM TO DO A BETTER JOB AND WORKING WITH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN PARTICULAR- PART OF THOSE CAN THAT ARE RELIANT ON DOMESTIC WELLS I THINK THE OTHER PIECE OF IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DATA. THAT IS AVAILABLE AND WE ARE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE. IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT DATA AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT DATA. WHICH WE ALREADY WHICH WE ALREADY ARE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS MUCH AS IMPLEMENTED A TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON THE ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT- IS YOU KNOW ONCE PLANS ARE- DEEMED ADEQUATE OR- DEEMED INADEQUATE AND THAT- MOVES THE PLAN INTO THE JURISDICTION OF THE WATER BOARD- FOR RESOLUTION BUT- FOR PLANS THAT ARE ADEQUATE. THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUAL REPORTS- BUT THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS IS A FULL SCALE REVIEW OF THOSE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS SO THOSE PLANS. THAT ARE- BUT LEE- OVERLY ROSY ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL WATER- WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR ALSO IN THOSE PLANS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF IF THAT WATER DOES NOT BECOME AVAILABLE WHAT ARE THEIR DEMAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO- TO ENSURE THAT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PLAN WILL RESULT IN SUSTAINABILITY AT THE END OF THE- TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. AS A GENERAL MATTER- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT. AS MANY COMMUNITY USES AS ALL THE BENEFICIAL USES AS AS POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS WITH A HEALTHY GROUNDWATER BASINS SO I THINK IT'S NATURAL AS YOU POINT OUT THAT- A LOT OF THESE PLANS YOU KNOW THEIR FIRST STEP IS TO WELL LET'S LOOK AND SEE WHAT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE. AND PROJECTS THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE WATER SUPPLIES COMING INTO THESE AREAS BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE WE'RE VERY MUCH CHALLENGED BY RESOURCE SCARCITY ISSUE SO WHAT PASSED THE COME IN AND- IN TANDEM WITH THAT ARE REALLY CREDIBLE PLANS TO- MANAGE DEMAND- MORE FULLY SO THAT- AS THE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. THERE'S TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER. SOURCE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. IT IT IF YOU COULD INSTALL UP IN THAT IS JUST TO EMPHASIZE OF THE TREMENDOUS OF IMPORTANCE OF YOUR ROLE IN. KEEPING THOSE PLANS CREDIBLE YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER THE PLAN IS ADEQUATE OR NOT THAT'S THE THAT'S REALLY WANTS A PLAN GETS IDENTIFIED IS NOT ADEQUATE THAT'S- A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN BUT- TO MAKE SURE THE- PLANS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS ADEQUATE TRULY ARE ADEQUATE IS. A RESPONSIBILITY THAT NOBODY ELSE IN THE IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO NO INTEREST GROUP OR ANYBODY ELSE WILL BE ABLE TO DO- AND IT'S ESSENTIAL AND THERE. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO TRY TO DE IDENTIFY THESE PLANS IS ADEQUATE- AND YOU ARE REALLY THERE THE TRUE REPRESENTATIVE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S BALANCE IN THAT EVALUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME MR FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION I HAVE I KNOW THAT SIGMA CERTAINLY ACT A BIG CONCERN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- I ALSO WANTED TO GET YOUR INPUT AND TAKE ON AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE DEMAND SIDE BUT THEN OF COURSE ONE OF FOCUS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE AS WELL IN TERMS OF- ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLIES AND I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON. THAT A LOT OF THESE A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE- FIVE WAYS THAT REQUIRE US TO ADDRESS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WAS AND THE ITEMS ARE HEARD BUT THEN. ALSO IN IN LOOK UP LARGER WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- THAT THESE COMMUNITIES NEED TO TAKE THAT MAY NOT BE DONE THE AND- IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT MAY GET A LOT OF THESE COMMITTEES TO SUSTAINABILITY. SO I GUESS MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THE FACT THAT I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE LOOKING. AT THESE ISSUES THROUGH A STRAW IN SILOS HOW DID PADDOCK HOW DO YOU GUYS VIEW. CIGNA THROUGH THE NEED FOR. LARGER WATER INFRASTRUCTURE STORAGE PROJECTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT'S A GREAT. IT IS INTEGRATING OUR WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NEEDS WITH CIGNA IS- THE GOVERNOR'S WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO. AND YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE- THE STATE WATER PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROVIDING SURFACE WATER TO COMMUNITIES THAT- COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR RECHARGE. THE WATER TRANSFER PROGRAM THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BENNETT. RAISED AS WELL- T. W. R. IS- WORKING ON A REALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF. THE WATER TRANSFER PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN- GET THROUGH THEM THIS THIS YEAR IS A DRY HERE AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING A VERY ACTIVE WATER TRANSFER MARKET WHICH WOULD BE TYPICAL- BUT WE ARE- UNDERWEIGHT AND EXPANDING THE TRANSFER. MARKET AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT- WE DO HAVE WE HAVE RECENTLY AMENDED OUR STATE WATER. ROGIC CONTRACTS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR LONGER TERM TRANSFERS AND- A HUGE BENEFIT OF THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS- WITH SOME OF THE- WATER RECHARGING NEEDS PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THERE'S OTHER ELEMENTS WITHIN THE WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO- THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION- IS WORKING ON- STUDYING. WHAT WE CALL REGIONAL CONVEYANCE SO WHAT WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN PARTICULAR REGIONS THAT WOULD. IN WORKING WITH A TRANSFER PROGRAM AND WORKING WITH OTHER BROADER BACKBONE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS HELP US MOVE WATER TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT ALTHOUGH IT THESE THINGS NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER. AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH- YOU KNOW THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL ACUTELY AWARE US. IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS KIND OF A RESOURCE SCARCITY ISSUE. AS YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN DECADES IN THE MAKING AND- WHAT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IS HOW WELL WE IMPLEMENT THESE PLANS- AND THE DEPARTMENT IS. FULLY COMMITTED TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF- I WOULD SAY GENERAL ANXIETY ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ADEQUACY DETERMINATION AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DECISION THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO MAKE IT NEEDS TO BE DECISIONS THAT ARE- OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF TECHNICAL INTEGRITY- THAT MEET THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. BUT ULTIMATELY. WE REALLY ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND IMPLEMENT THESE PLANS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT DECISIONS ON HOW WE'RE MANAGING THIS WATER RESOURCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT CERTAINLY NEEDS TO SUPPORT- LOCAL ECONOMIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE THAT OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND THIS CAN REALLY BE A TOOL TO HELP US. ADDRESS SOME OF THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THAT- YOU KNOW PLAYED TO THESE COMMUNITIES BUT AGAIN ONE OF THE ANOTHER BENEFICIAL USE- AS- REQUIRED IN THE LAW IS ON THESE GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS SO THERE'S ALSO AN ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT. SO IMPLEMENT. IN MANY WAYS IS GETTING IMPLEMENTATION THE FOUNDATIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION SET UP APPROPRIATELY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE ENGAGED AND WE CAN BE SURE THAT- THERE IS A TRANSPARENT. AND PUBLIC WAY OF INTERACTING AS SOME OF OUR INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS THOSE ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE TRUE OR NOT TRUE- THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THERE IS- AN ABILITY TO MOVE TO OTHER- PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION THAT CAN ENSURE THAT ALL BENEFICIAL USES ARE PROTECTED. AND THAT THE SPACE AND THE CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY BY TWENTY FORTY. HI APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS LANKER TO THE OF THE BUILD IN SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALIGN THE TIME LINES TOGETHER TO CREATE SOME SYNERGY. COORDINATE WITH THE GSA'S THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS THE WATER AGENCIES NOTED SOMETHING A LOT OF COMMITTEES BOTH MEN CERTAINLY ALL COMMITTEES ARE UNIQUE. BUT MOST COMMITTEES MAY NEED ADDITIONAL PIPELINES THEY MADE A NEED FOR CONVEYANCERS STUDIES AND WILL AND SURFACED ORDER OR UNDERGROUND STORAGE AND OF THOSE PROJECTS. TAKE A LONG TIME WITH WITH NEEDED RESOURCES AND SO IF THAT'S THE GOAL IF THOSE PROJECTS ARE NEEDED FOR SUSTAINABILITY BUT THEY'RE BEING. HARMED OR PUNISHED ON THE ON THE FRONT AND WENT IN IN TERMS OF BUT THEY KNOW THEY KNOWLEDGE AFFECTING NEED THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE LONG RUN- JUST TO ALIGN THOSE TIMELINES. AND PHILANDO SCHOOL. A LOT OF. I THINK ALL COMMITTEES TO GET THERE BUT SOME. WHAT WE NEED TO BE DONE AND WHAT CAN BE IMMEDIATELY DON'T ALIGN AND SO AS LONG AS THERE'S FLEXIBILITY- AND WORKING TOGETHER IN COORDINATION WITH. THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS GSA'S I THINK THAT THAT'S THE PATH FORWARD NOT SOME RIGID- ABIDETH BY SOME CALENDAR. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR A PARTY WE HAVE- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM L. A. O. OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES THANK YOU AGAIN REGIONALLY LIVES WITH THE L. A. M. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS JUSTIFIED AND MEETS AN IMPORTANT STATE NEED AND STATE PRIORITY THESE ARE THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS IN PARTICULAR. OF THE DOUBLE BURDEN OF BOTH THE GREATEST IMBALANCE AND THE MOST EXPEDITED TIMELINES. WE DO NOT FIND- THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS GVEN A COMPELLING RATIONALE FOR EARLY ACTION I THINK YOU'LL HEAR A COMMON THEME FROM US OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKSOF HEARINGS THAT WE THINK THERE'S A PRETTY HIGH BAR- THAT THE STATION MUST MEET IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY PUTTING OUT MANY EARLY- IT REALLY DOES LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S. FLEXIBILITY PARTICULARLY AROUND GENERAL FUND INTENDED JUNE YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN SOME GENERAL FUND OFF THE TABLE THROUGH EARLY APPROPRIATIONS. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION HERE WOULD BE TO PUT THE FULL SIXTY MILLION OUT OR CONSIDER THE FULL SIXTY MILLION AS PART OF THE FULL BUDGET PACKAGE RATHER THAN- SENDING HALF OF IT OUT EARLY. YOU KNOW WHILE WHILE IT MAY BE NICE TO HAVE RENDON AN INITIAL GRANT ROUND A FEW MONTHS CERTAINLY THAT PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING FOR THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT EVEN GOING TO BE AWARDED INTEL MAY.

GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL AND JUST THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. YOU KNOW I REALLY QUIET QUICKLY REFLECT BACK TO THE COMMENTS THAT. ARE DIRECTOR NEMETH MADE- AND THE QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT. AROUND SICK MY AND COORDINATION AROUND THESE REALLY. CRITICAL GOALS THAT WE HAVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND HELD WATER RESILIENCY PORTFOLIO IS REALLY STITCHES TOGETHER- IT'S THAT THAT IS THE CASE. AND REALLY THE COORDINATION THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES. TECHNOLOGY AT CIGNA IMPLEMENTATION. IS A CONTINUE ALONG OF IMPLEMENTATION BETWEEN OUR TWO AGENCIES. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDER THIRTY. THE GREATEST TECHNICAL EXPERTISE SEN AND I LEADERSHIP WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS. TO HELP US. NAVIGATE WHAT ARE. GOING TO BE. A DIFFICULT ASSESSMENT NOT EASY CERTAINLY FOR THE FARM WATER RESOURCES. BUT THEN AGAIN. WHAT WE WANT TO BE. A HIS WIDE OPEN AND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE ACCOMPLISH THEIR- INCREDIBLE GOAL OF. ENSURING THAT THE MILLING CAL. WITH ACCESS TO SAY ENOUGH FOR WATER ARE CONJOINED WITH THE CALLS OF SIGMA WHICH IS INCREDIBLE OVERLAP WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THERE IMPACTS AND THE WAY WE IMPLEMENT OUR OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE DIRECTOR'S LEADERSHIP AND THE GREAT WORK THAT WE'VEBEEN ABLE TO DO OVER THE LAST MONTHS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED DISCUSSION WITH THE- WITH THE- THE LEGISLATURE AROUND AROUND AT WORK. SO JUST THINKING. I'M ON HERE ON THOUGH IS ACTUALLY ON OUR SITE CLEANUP PROGRAM. AND INVESTMENT INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP OUR SITE. CLEANUP PROGRAM IS ONE OF THE CORE PROGRAMS AT THE STATE ATER BOARD. IT IS HOW WE CLEAN UP WHAT IS A CREDIBLE LEGACY OF THE DEGRADATION OF OUR WATER QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT. OTHER BIG GOALS LIKE SIX MONTHS- AS WE LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES THE CLIMATE CHANGE. WE FACE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WATER QUALITY IS. CONTINUING TO BE- WILL BE EIGHT EIGHT ISSUE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING YOU KNOW IT IS THE BASIS FOR ALL OF OUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. R. OR ACCESS TO WATER AND THE QUALITY OF THAT WATER WHICH IMPACTS LARA BENEFICIAL USES. AND SO. THE REQUEST HERE IS FOR A TWENTY ONE PERMANENT POSITIONS CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM HAVE SEVENTY FIVE. AND THERE'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OPEN CASES BUT ONLY ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THAT ARE ACTIVE BUT THAT SEVENTY FIVE. MEMBER STAFF CAN ACTUALLY BE WORKING ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE- THESE PROGRAMS THAT VARY IN COMPLEXITY- AND IN H. I. AN UNDERSTANDING HERE YOU KNOW WE HAVE CUT CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN. SHE PASSED THAT ARE INCREASING THE WORKLOAD SO WE'RE SEEING OUT THERE BUT WE ALSO HAVE HUGE OUR LEGACY CHALLENGES AROUND. DC PD BY ONE TWO THREE TCP- YOU KNOW. VOLATILE I A CO. FROM FROM IN JUST THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO- YOU KNOW THESE THESE THIS PROGRAM IS SUCH A CORE PROGRAM WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY IMPROVING. THE QUALITY OF OUR WATER RESOURCES BILL SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I THINK IT'S A QUICKLY ALIGNED AS WELL WITH THE WATER RESILIENCE FOLIO. AND SO I WOULD JUST SPEAK AND SUPPORT HERE- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THERE IS ABOUT A BACKLOG OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY CASES. OUT THAT IS DOWN FROM A FEW YEARS AGO UP IN THAT YOU KNOW YEAH THOUSANDS AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK- AWAY AT THAT BACKLOG BUT- ULTIMATELY NEED THE BODIES ACTUALLY PROCESS. WHAT ARE NOT BY AND LARGE REIMBURSABLE- ACTIVITIES OF THESE ARE AGAIN THAT WE HAVE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES- THEY'RE THEY'RE OFTEN VOLUNTARILY TAKEN OUT. BUT WE NEED THAT THE STAFF OVER ACTION WERE RECEIVED THE ACTUAL SITE CLEANUP THE TECHNICAL RESOURCES TO APPROVE THE BEAT UP PLANS. AND ACTUALLY. GET GET OUR- WATERWAYS. IN BETTER SHAPE. SO ON THANK YOU AND AGAIN. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT ANGLER WE DIDN'T TO PASS OVER YOUR- BECAUSE OF THE THANK YOU OF THE WORK YOU DO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION. TO IT THERE'S A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THE- STAFF REPORT BUT I THINK IT KIND OF BOILS DOWN TO- HOW FAR THESE FUNDS GOING TO TAKE US WHAT WHAT. MORE WORK LIES AHEAD WHAT'S GOING TO COST TO- TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND- I HAD TO THE EXTENT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE FAST CONTAMINATION ARE WE GOING TO BE. LOOKING TO HOLD THOSE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE DESERVE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT. HERE WE THAT YOU KNOW I WAS REALLY- I WAS LISTENING QUITE INTENTLY- WITH- DIRECTOR BONHAMS A REPORT ABOUT THEIR IM SERVICE BASED BUDGETING AND ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT MIRRORS A LOT OF THE PERFORMANCE SPACE- METRICS AND THAT WE HAVE BUILT INTO OUR PROGRAM NEARLY TEN YEARS AGO NOW AND CONTINUE TO REFINE. THAT SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WHICH IS TO TELL ALL STATE THAT CAN HELP US KIND OF A SCHOOL ABOUT WHAT POTENTIALLY BUT THE DOLLARS AND THE POSITIONS YOU KNOW MEAN AND SO FAR AND SO FAR AS NUMBER PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT BACKLOG CAN COME DOWN. WE CAN WILL CIRCLE BACK WITH SOME OF THAT DATA I'LL JUST SAY THAT MUCH OF THAT IS IN HINDSIGHT- IT'S HARD SOMETIMES PROJECTING OUT SOME OF THAT WORK PARTICULARLY WITH STATE EMERGING CONTAMINANTS LIKE G. FAST- BECAUSE WE'RE STILL NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT THE COST YOU KNOW THE COSTS VARY FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND TO MILLIONS. PER SITE AND THEN YOU KNOW THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF A CONTAMINATION IS ALWAYS VERY PROJECT SPECIFIC SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SORT OF FORECAST OUT WHAT THE RESOURCE IS EXACTLY WILL GET US BUT I THINK WE CAN GET SOME SENSE AT LEAST AND AT LEAST THROUGH HINDSIGHT FROM WHAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED PREVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW I WILL I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN IT COMES TO P. FACET IS STILL AN EMERGING CONTAMINANT CONCERNED BUT WE'VE TAKEN REAL FACED A REAL PHASED APPROACH AND- TRYING O ON EARTH WHERE PEOPLE ASK CONTAMINATION IS REALLY STARTING WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS SITES LIKE AIRPORTS. AND FIREFIGHTING- AREAS WHERE FIREFIGHTING FOAM WERE USED- WHICH WE KNOW HOW TO CONTAIN HIGH AMOUNTS OF LUCKY FAST BUT ALSO WITH PRO PLAYERS AND NOW MOVING ON TO WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS- AND BETTER UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT AND EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS OF THE FASTER KNOWING THAT. ARE THERE IS SO MUCH YOU KNOW IN OUR CLOTHES AND STILL IN MODERN- GARMENTS THAT- MAY BE A SOURCE AND SO AGAIN THE COST THERE THE TIME AND- IT'S STILL AT WORST OFF THE FOREFRONT OF THAT SO- SCOPING IT OUT- WHAT WE'LL DO OUR BEST. AND AGAIN- THE RESPONSE TO AND YES I ON. WHEN IT COMES TO RISK. PARTY IT IS ALWAYS SO. TO ENSURE WE IMPORT. GET TO AND FINE AND KEEP. WE'RE PARTIES FOR. THE DEGRADATION THAT THEY'VE CREATED IN THE HARM TO BENEFICIAL USES OF OTHER OTHER USERS INCLUDING MOST IMPORTANTLY DRINKING WATER FOR ALL OF US- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT BARED ON RATE PAYERS IS NOT BARED ON. ON THE STATE BUT INSTEAD THOSE WHO. OPERATED THE CONTAMINATION TO BEGIN WITH- SO. YES AS A- COMPLETE PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALWAYS ADJACENT WOULD BE FAST. I'VE SEEN SOME REALLY ACTION I THINK FROM FROM SOME WATER DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS POINT- NATIONALLY AS WELL I KNOW SOME STATES HAVE. UNDERTAKEN WORK. AND I KNOW. WE CONTINUE TO. HAVE DISCUSSIONS AROUND. GREAT AT THE YOU AND THE- OTHER MISTER SMITH YOU JUST YOURSELF- IN REGARDS TO BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE- IS A- RECOVERABLE. FURTHER DISCHARGERS AND WHY DO WE HAVE A BACKLOG. AND IS IT MORE THAN A YEAR OLD A BACKLOG ARE WE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK. TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WITH WITH THE- I THINK ON THE SITE YEAH I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SITE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES A BACKLOG BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MOST SORT FORTY ESTá AMONGST- THE CHALLENGES OR THE CLEANUP SITES THAT THERE ARE- AND YOU KNOW WE AND I'LL SAY THAT YES I WHILE IT'S- MOSTLY FULLY RECOVERABLE IN SOME CASES IT'S- IT'S NEEDING TO BE POP ROCK REPORTS BUT ACTION AND- YOU KNOW IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER TO. DECIDE BRING TO OUR POLLUTION WHEN IT COMES TO THE RECOVERY OF THE FUNDING- YOU KNOW THE AGAIN THE BACKLOG IS THERE BECAUSE YOU NEED THE ACTUAL BODIES. TO PROCESS THE PROJECTS YOU TO REVIEW THE PLANS AND TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER AND ENSURE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE ARE UNDERTAKING THE WORK AND THE PROJECT IS A VIABLE ONE BECAUSE IT'S ONE THAT'S IN THE PROGRAM. IT'S BEING MONITORED WE'RE SEEING THE COST PER ROUTE YOU KNOW GETTING REIMBURSED ON THAT WERE BILLING- AND SO IT'S KIND OF THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT NEED FOR JUST THE CORE- IF YOU WILL BODIES TO ACTUALLY PROCESS. THAT WORK THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOVER MORE IF YOU WILL- SO THE BACKLOG IS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE IT'S REALLY TO ME SEVENTY FIVE STAFF IT SOLELY BEEN DOING WHAT IS I GET UP. AT THIS AT THIS POINT AN OPEN CASE LOAD OF FOUR THOUSAND- WHICH AGAIN THEY'RE THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY'RE BOTH KIND OF FOCUS HAVE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TO A TIME. IN AND USE OF SUBCONTRACTORS INITIALLY FOR THE SOIL TESTINGS AND ALL THAT. OR DO WE'VE EVER TO DO EVERYTHING IN HOUSE. NOW EVERYTHING IS. THROUGH SO THE RICH. PARTIES WILL SUB.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARK SMITH'S POLICY GROUP HERE ON BEHALF OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CLIENTS WANT TO TOUCH ON THREE DIFFERENT ITEMS- FIRST HELLO TO THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THIS YEAR ON THE NON PRESENTATION CALENDAR THE COASTAL CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHO WERE THE SPONSORS OF AB NINETEEN FORTY NINE BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BANNER ABOUT THE SUPPORT THAT ISSUE MOVING FORWARD AND ARE GLAD TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT MAKING THAT INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S ONLY MARINE HATCHERY PROGRAM WHEN I MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT DIRECTOR BOTTOM TALKED ABOUT PARTICULARLY THE INVESTMENTS IN WETLANDS AND LICENSING MODERNIZATION I REPRESENT HUNTING AND ANGLING COMMUNITIES I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT LICENSES AS A PRODUCT THA IS SOLD. IN A STORE FOR EXAMPLE AND EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THOSE PRODUCTS HAVE TO BE REFRESHED IN ORDER TO GET THE PUBLIC TO CONTINUE BUYING THEM WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ELECTRONIC LICENSE AS WE NEED TO OFFER ALTERNATIVES LIKE A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY ANNUAL FISHING LICENSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT IS GOING TO CARRY THAT BILLAGAIN THIS YEAR. THE PRODUCTS OF THE DEPARTMENT CELLS WHICH GENERATE THEM A LOT OF REVENUE NEED TO BE IMPROVED AND ENHANCE FROM TIME TO TIME SO WE SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S INTEREST IN INVESTING IN UPGRADING ITS LICENSING SYSTEM. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY TALKING ABOUT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING MYSELF AND OTHERS WHO WILL TALK ON THE PHONE LIKE KIM DELFINO JENNIFER FEARING AND MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST DECADE WE KNOW THERE IS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WE DIDN'T NEED A STUDY TO TELL US THAT.

MISS AGUILAR CURRY HAS A BILL THAT WILL DO EXACTLY THAT TO FUNDED PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT WE OURSELVES CANNOT CLOSE THIS GAP.
