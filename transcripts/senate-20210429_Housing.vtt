01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.779
REALLY ASSISTED THE CALIFORNIA

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:45.320
THE BILL HAS A VERY I THINK OUR-

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.589
PRACTICAL BUT ESSENTIAL PURPOSE

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:51.293
WHICH IS THAT IT HELPS TO

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.462
GREENLIGHT THOSE HOUSING

RULES NOW WE ALREADY HAVE OTHER

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.203
STATUTES ON THE BOOK THAT HELPS

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.007
TO DO THAT HOWEVER. WE WATCHED

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:06.975
THAT PROJECTS WERE MOVING

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.844
FORWARD AND THEN A LOCAL

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.479
GOVERNMENTS WOULD CHANGE ITS

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:13.515
RULES WHICH THEN WOULD EITHER

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:14.783
ELIMINATE THE BILL WOULD BE FOR

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.018
THAT HOUSING PROJECT WHICH

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.553
PREVIOUSLY MET THE RULES TO GO

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:21.890
FORWARD OR GREATLY DELAY IT. ON

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:25.861
SO WHAT SB THREE THIRTY DID AND

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.896
WHAT I WILL EXPLAIN SB EIGHT

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.999
DOES IS SB THREE THIRTY SAID

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.067
LOOK WE'RE IN A CRISIS RIGHT

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:35.170
NOW LET'S JUST TAKE A PAUSE AND

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:38.674
LET'S. STOP CHANGING THE RULES

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.508
FOR FIVE YEARS LET'S STOP

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.510
CHANGING THE RULES LET'S HOLD

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:43.912

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.014
DECREASE HOUSING YOU KNOW OUR

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:48.283
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND

ALLOW THOSE HOT THAT HOUSING

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:52.855

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.630
OF THE PANDEMIC AS WE ALL KNOW

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.600
MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN HALTED.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:07.102
SO WHAT SB EIGHT DOES IS IT

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.873
EXTENDS THE LIFE OF SB THREE

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:11.940

ACCELERATE THE HOUSING THAT

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.448

EXPIRED IT WOULD STILL GO AWAY

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.365
BUT WE WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.833
TO FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.402
HAVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MOVE

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.802
DURING A WILDFIRE DEFENSIBLE

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:23.571
SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:25.372
FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.641
IN AN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:28.309
ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:30.611
IMPLEMENTED. TO VERIFY ONGOING

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.813
COMPLAINTS BACK BY FINANCING

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:34.982
MECHANISMS SUCH AS H. AWAY

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:37.051
FUNDS SITE SPECIFIC SAFETY

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.419
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:40.554
DEVELOPMENT AS A WHOLE IS PLANT

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.456
IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED TO

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.691
RESISTING CULTURING OF

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.793
UNCONTROLLED FIRE. DEVELOPMENT

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:47.328
LAYOUT DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT THAT

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:52.466
REDUCES WILDFIRE RISK. TO THE

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:53.200
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE.

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.435
BLUNTLY PUT THIS LEGISLATION

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:55.269
THAT IF DEVELOPMENT CAN'T MEET

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.538
STANDARD. LOCALS SHOULD NOT

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.406
APPROVED. BUT WHICH IS

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.575
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. THE

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.043
STANDARDS ARE TIERED SET THE

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.211
STANDARDS INCREASINGLY STRONGER

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.380
AS DEVELOPMENTS GROW LARGER IN

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:08.182
THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:10.384
ZONES THE REASON IS THIS LARGER

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.719
DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE PEOPLE

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:13.087
INTO THE WORLD. AND SO THEY

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.521
MUST MEET HIGHER STANDARDS AND

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:16.123
SMALLER DEVELOPMENTS THIS MEANS

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.258
THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:19.360
STRINGENT BUT NOT SO COSTLY AS

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:20.961
TO TOTALLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENT

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:22.096
WHICH BY THE WAY IS A

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.764
SIGNIFICAN AND THEN IN. THAT WE

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:27.434
ARE TAKING AFTER FEEDBACK FROM

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:28.769
GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE. AND

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.037
WE KNOW THAT HALF OF THE

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:31.572
BUILDINGS LOST OVER THE LAST

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.340
DECADE WERE IN THE WILL BE.

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:35.209
BUILT UNDER CURRENT FIRE CODES.

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:36.710
THIS BILL ALSO ENHANCES THE

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:37.878
PLANNING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.079
MUST DO INCLUDING TO COME UP

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.748
WITH A STRATEGY TO RETROFIT

01:38:40.814 --> 01:38:42.683
EXISTING BUILDINGS. NOW THERE

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.618
ARE SOME THERE'S SOME HOPE TO

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:47.021
DO ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I LIKE

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:47.688
TO BE A TO TALK ABOUT THE

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.857
FACTS. THIS BILL IS ALMOST

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.158
IDENTICAL TO A BILL THAT WAS

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.593
APPROVED BY A BIPARTISAN

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.762
MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES AND

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.163
SENT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.066
LIKE  SAID WE MADE AMENDMENTS

01:38:59.133 --> 01:38:59.600
TO ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.335
CONCERNS. MANY MEMBERS OF THIS

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.570
COMMITTEE SUPPORTED. NEARLY AN

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:06.040
IDENTICAL BILL SB ONE EIGHTY

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:08.709
TWO LAST YEAR. THE PROPONENTS

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:10.311
ON THIS BILL WERE NEUTRAL ON

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:12.880
THE LEGISLATION WHICH IS NEARLY

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:15.749
IDENTICAL LAST YEAR. AND OTHER

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.484
CONCERNS THIS YEAR ARE WITH THE

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:18.385
PROVISIONS THE BILL THAT ARE

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:20.587
THE SAME PROVISIONS THAT WERE

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.523
CONTAINED IN THE BILL LAST YEAR.

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:23.924
SO WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:27.494
DO IS THIS. WE BELIEVE THAT SB

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:29.229

DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY.

01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:40.874
THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.509

02:22:57.835 --> 02:23:00.171
ZONING TO ALLOW- BUILDINGS

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:03.274
BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS-

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:05.643
AND THE WHITE HOT WHAT IS

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:06.778
HAPPENING NOW IN A NUMBER OF

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:09.414
CITIES. IS THE CITY WILL ZONE

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:11.115
THROUGH ITS PLANNING CODE OR

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:13.384
GENERAL PLAN FOR SMALL MULTI

02:23:13.451 --> 02:23:16.955
UNIT THREE FOUR SIX EIGHT TEN-

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:18.723
AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME.

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:21.592
IMPOSE HARSH SQUARE FOOTAGE

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:23.594
REQUIREMENTS KNOWN AS F. A. R.

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:26.064
FLOOR AREA RATIO. THAT MAKE IT

02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:31.469
EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE. TO

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:31.970
BUILD TO THAT ZONING. SO

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:35.640
EXAMPLE IF A CITY ZONES. AN

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:39.143
AREA LOCALLY AT FOUR UNITS TO

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.044
SAY YOU CAN BUILD A FOUR UNIT

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:43.181
BUILDING- ON THIS PARCEL AND

02:23:43.247 --> 02:23:45.550
THEN IT DOES NOT SAY IT'S A

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:47.251
THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LIVE

02:23:47.318 --> 02:23:49.053
AND THE CITY AT THE SAME TIME

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.489
IMPOSES A VERY HARSH POINT

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:54.192
THREE F. A. R. WHAT THAT MEANS

02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:55.693
IS THAT THE TOTAL SQUARE

02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:57.562
FOOTAGE OF THAT BUILDING. WOULD

02:23:57.628 --> 02:23:59.230
BE LIMITED TO NINE HUNDRED

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:00.765
SQUARE FEET WHEN YOU DIVIDE

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:03.001
THAT BY FOUR THAT'S TWO HUNDRED

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:05.837
AND TWENTY FIVE SQUARE FEET.

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:08.539
PER UNIT NO ONE IS GOING TO

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:10.608
BUILD THAT- AND IN FACT I

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:12.910
BELIEVE THAT IS- IT MIGHT NOT

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:15.213
ACTUALLY EVEN BE LEGAL IN TERMS

02:24:15.279 --> 02:24:16.547
OF THE SIZE OF THE UNIT BEING

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:17.782
SO SMALL BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

02:24:17.849 --> 02:24:19.717
GOING TO GET BUILT AND SO

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:21.219
EFFECTIVELY THAT IS THE CITY.

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:24.055
HAVING BASICALLY FAKE ZONING

02:24:24.122 --> 02:24:26.891
THE SALE ON PAPER REZONING FOR

02:24:26.958 --> 02:24:27.925
FOUR UNITS OR WHATEVER THE CASE

02:24:27.992 --> 02:24:29.627
MAY BE BUT BECAUSE OF THESE

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.529
OTHER SQUARE FOOTAGE ARBITRARY

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.664
REQUIREMENTS IT'S ACTUALLY

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:34.932
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BUILD

02:24:34.999 --> 02:24:36.768
ABOUT ZONING- THAT IS BAD

02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:39.270
GOVERNMENT- AND WHAT THIS BILL

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:42.507
DOES IS IT SAYS TO CITIES ONCE

02:24:42.573 --> 02:24:44.742
YOU HAVE VOLUNTARILY LOCALLY

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:47.311
ZONED FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT. YOU

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:48.746
CAN NOT IMPOSE OTHER

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:50.715
RESTRICTIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:52.750
GIVE WITH ONE HAND AND TAKE

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:53.918
WITH THE OTHER IT HOSTIN

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:56.187
DESIGNING HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:57.522
WANT TO BE CLEAR DOESN'T APPLY

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:59.590

02:25:17.875 --> 02:25:19.343
STANDARDS AND I GOT A DOESN'T

02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:21.145
EVEN APPLY IN AREAS THAT ARE

02:25:21.212 --> 02:25:27.251
ZONED. SINGLE FAMILY. THE

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:27.885
ANSWER WHAT IT DOES IS IF YOU

ENTIRE CITY FOR FOUR UNITS FOR

02:25:40.832 --> 02:25:43.501
CLOCKS- SACRAMENTO UPDATED ITS

02:25:43.568 --> 02:25:45.103
FLOOR AREA RATIO TO BE ONE

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:47.171
POINT NO. BECAUSE IT'S LOWER

02:25:47.238 --> 02:25:48.272
FLOOR AREA RATIO THAT HAD

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:49.707
EXISTED WOULD HAVE MADE IT

02:25:49.774 --> 02:25:51.642
IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY BUILD.

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:54.345

BUILDINGS THAT ARE EIGHT TO TEN

02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:03.621
UNIT C. F. A. R. WOULD BE ONE

02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:06.491
POINT TWO. FIVE SO THIS WILL

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:09.760
SIMPLY ENABLE PEOPLE TO BUILD.

02:26:09.827 --> 02:26:11.162
TO THE DENSITY THAT THE CITY

MODERN ZONING- THAT THE CITY
