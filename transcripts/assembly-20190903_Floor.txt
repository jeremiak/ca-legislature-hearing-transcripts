FILE ITEMS ONE NINETY SEVEN THROUGH TO A ONE. PASS AND RETAIN. THIS IS FILE ITEM TWO OH TWO SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR. CORPORATION SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY FOUR BY SENATOR BELL AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO DO THAT ALSO. DOCTOR WEBER. YES GOOD MORNING MISS OF GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SENATOR BAIL. WE KNOW IS AN ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PRESENT TO YOU SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR. THE KEEP YOUTH CLOSE TO HOME ACT. THE ANNUAL COST TO CONFINE YOUTH AT THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AVERAGES MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOUTH. OF THAT AMOUNT COUNTIES CONTRIBUTE ONLY 8% OF THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PER YOUTH WAS STATE WITH THE STATE PAYING THE REST AND TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZING THE COST. SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR INCREASES THE COUNTY THREE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MORE FOR MANY YOUTH TO SPUR LOCAL REHABILITATION COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT AND KEEP THEM CLOSE TO HOME. WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN D. JJ'S POPULATION OVER THE LAST DECADE. WELL WE HAD NEARLY TEN THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE IN DJJ. WE ROUGHLY NOW ONLY HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED. HOWEVER THE DECLINE IS DUE TO THE STEADY REDUCTION IN YOUTH CRIME AND CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE TO PROMOTE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. WE NEED TO CONTINUE MAKING THESE CHANGES FOR OUR YOUTH AND INVEST IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL ALTERNATIVES. CONFINEMENT AT A YOUTH PRISON IS DETRIMENTAL TO ONE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR YOUTH ESPECIALLY CAN IT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE TRAUMA. THE YOUTH MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. REHABILITATION CREATES CHANGE NOT INCARCERATION. STUDIES SHOW YOUTH ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AS THEY MOVE FROM ADOLESCENCE TO ADULTHOOD AND HOW WE CARE FOR THEM DOING THESE YEARS WILL SHAPE THEIR FUTURE. THE GOVERNOR AGREES THAT THE CORRECT THE FACILITIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTS TO ADDRESS YOUTH UNDERLYING NEEDS. THAT IS WHY WE PROPOSED TO SHIP DJJ FROM CDC ARE THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BECAUSE YOUTH NEED SOCIAL WORKERS NOT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. IF WE LOOK AT THE J. J.'S MOST RECENT DATA FROM TWENTY TWELVE WE SEE THAT 74% OF YOU THROUGH A SET OF EIGHT WITHIN THREE YEARS OF RELEASE. IN ORDER TO CHANGE THOSE NUMBERS AND ENSURE SUCCESS UPON RELEASE.

NURSE TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE COUNTLESS PATIENTS TO SEE KAREN HOSPITALS AS WELL AS THE NURSES WHO WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS THE DAUGHTER OF A LIFELONG CAREER NURSE WHO WORKED IN ABOUT EVERY DEPARTMENT THAT ONE CAN IMAGINE IN A HOSPITAL THERE IS NO MORE VEXING AND PERSISTENT AN ISSUE THAT MY MOM WOULD MENTION THEN THE RATIOS SHE FACED WHETHER AS A FLOOR NURSE OR A CHARGE NURSE IN THE HOSPITAL SHE WORKED IN AND FOR THE PATIENT SHE TOOK CARE OF. SB TWO TWO SEVEN EMPOWERS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY ENFORCING MANDATED LONGSTANDING NURSED RATIOS. FINING HOSPITALS THAT REPEATEDLY BREAK THE STANDARD. FROM TO THAT AND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO DEFICIENCY ALLEGATION REPORTED. EIGHTY P. H. THE DEPARTMENT'S PRESENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES ARE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH AS IT CONDUCTS INSPECTIONS EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT HOSPITALS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. THIS PERIODIC CHECK IS FAR TOO INFREQUENT AND ALLOWS HOSPITALS TO PREPARE BEFORE CD PH OFFICIALS CONDUCT THEIR INSPECTIONS. SB TWO TWO SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCT UNANNOUNCED VISITS TO INSPECT FOR COMPLIANCE WITH NURSING STAFF REQUIREMENTS. THIS MEASURE WOULD ALSO EMPOWER THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WITH FINES IN CASES WHERE THOSE RATIOS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED.

THOSE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR OUT OF RATIO VIOLATIONS REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND LET US REMEMBER THAT THE STAFFING RATIOS ARE THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM. THAT A FACILITY SHOULD BE OPERATING UNDER NOT THE IDEAL. OR THE TYPICAL STAFFING SO WE MUST ACT NOW TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK EVERY DAY DUE TO THESE VIOLATIONS WE ARE COMMITTING A DISSERVICE TO PATIENTS. AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ALIKE BY.

THIS IS SB TWO SEVEN SIX CORPORATION SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR PAN AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I AM BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX A BILL NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITY AS OUR COUNTRY'S EXPERIENCE LEADING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF MEASLES INFECTIONS IN OVER A QUARTER CENTURY. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX MAINTAINS AND RESTORES THE INTEGRITY OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO LEGALLY REQUIRED VACCINES FOR SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX ENSURES THAT STUDENTS WHO TRULY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WILL RECIEVE THE EXEMPTION WHILE KEEPING THOSE SAME CHILDREN SAFE AT SCHOOL BY ENSURING THAT THERE IS COMMUNITY COMMUNITY. THIS BILL PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF THESE CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL IN INTEREST CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GO ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY WITHOUT IT BEING AT RISK OF BEING INFECTED WITH SIRIUS PREVENTABLE DISEASES. ARI BEN ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR CASES OF MEASLES REPORTED THE UNITED STATES THIS YEAR. THE MOST CASES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND SINCE MEASLES WAS DECLARED ELIMINATED IN TWO THOUSAND. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN FIFTY CASES OF MEASLES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING MULTIPLE CASES AT LA ACTS MANY OF WHICH INVOLVED UNVACCINATED FOLKS CATCHY MISSILES OVERSEAS AND RETRAIN THE CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISEASE AND THERE IS AN ONGOING OUTBREAK IN BUTTE COUNTY. AS REPORTED SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE WHILE MEASLES HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THIS YEAR UNLIKE OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA HAS NOT SUFFERED A HUGE OUTBREAK LIKE MUSES AFRICA BEGAN IN DISNEYLAND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE TOOK ACTION BY PASSING SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN. TO RESTORE COMMUNITY IMMUNITY TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE STATE VACCINATION RATES FOR EACH ENTERING KINDERGARTEN CLASS TO ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT. ENOUGH TO BEGIN RESTORING COMMUNITY IMMUNITY. BUT THIS PROTECTION IS BEING UNDERMINED BY HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS WERE PROFITING FROM PUTTING CHILDREN AT RISK IN MAKING OUR SCHOOLS LESS SAFE. SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE THE GRANTING A MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BY PHYSICIANS. WHICH EXPECTED EACH CHILD TO BE EVALUATED BY THEIR ACTUAL PHYSICIAN WHO REGULARLY CARED FOR THEM RECEIVING THE EXEMPTION APPLYING THE STANDARD OF CARE. INSTEAD AFTER PET PASSAGE OF TWO SEVENTY SEVEN WE WITNESS PHYSICIANS TO ADVERTISE EXEMPTIONS FOR CASH ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ON THE INTERNET. SOME PARENTS WOULD POST THAT THEIR CHILDREN'S PHYSICIAN REFUSED TO GRANT A CHILD A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THEY BOUGHT ONE FROM A DISTANT POSITION. THE RESULT OF THESE FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WITH A QUADRUPLING OF THE PERCENTAGE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE STATE. IN A DECLINE IN THE STATE VACCINATION RATE BELOW 95% FOR THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR. BUT MORE CONCERNING OVER HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES AT OVER PERCENT. MEANING STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOLS ARE RISK FOR MAJOR OUTBREAK AND ARE NO LONGER SAFE. THESE SCHOOLS REPRESENT TENDER FOR A DISEASE WILD FIRE THE CAN FARM THE BROADER COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA CANNOT ALLOW A HANDFUL ABOUT PHYSICIANS TO PUT OUR CHILDREN IN DANGER PARTICULARLY BABIES TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED AND CHILDREN WHO GENUINELY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS OR SPONSORING SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WITH THE PARENTS OF ACCIDENT CALIFORNIA. PHYSICIANS ARE HOLDING THEMSELVES IN THE COLLEAGUES ACCOUNTABLE TO PRACTICING QUALITY CARE BASED ON SCIENCE AND TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. WITH AMENDMENTS TAKEN UP FOR THIS. BEGINNING A TWENTY TWENTY ONE SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WILL REQUIRE ALL MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BE FILED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND PHYSICIANS WILL HENCEFORTH BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH. THE NUMBER OF THE- PEOPLE HAVE WORKED ON THESE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE TWO THINGS. THOSE EXEMPTIONS IT'LL BE IDENTIFIED AND LOOKED AT OUR WHEN DOCTORS PRESCRIBE OVER FIVE OF THEM A YEAR MOST PEDIATRICIANS IF YOU TALK TO THEM MIGHT HAVE DONE FIVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. SO IF A DOCTOR IS SIMPLY HANDING OUT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IT'S AN INDICATION. THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. IN MY HOMETOWN OF SAN DIEGO ONE DOCTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER A THIRD OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. SHE ADVERTISED QUITE FRANKLY YOU WOULD SIMPLY SEND YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS TO HER SHE WOULD REVIEW THEM NEVER SEE THE CHILD IN MEET WITH A WHOLE GROUP OF FAMILIES TRITE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. LATEST GENERAL WE'RE NOT GETTING BETWEEN A CHILD AND THEIR POSITION. WE'RE GETTING BETWEEN A PARENT WHO IS OUT SEEKING EXEMPTIONS AND A PHYSICIAN WILLING TO WRITE THEM IN MASS. AND EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS THIS WILL STILL BE REVIEWED. BY ICAL PANEL. THEY'LL BE DUE PROCESS OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL IT. AND THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE EVEN REVIEW A BALL R. WITH THOSE DOCTORS WHO HAVE WRITTEN OVER A FIVE YEAR ORDER SCHOOL THAT FALLS BELOW THE HERD IMMUNITY STANDARD THIRTY SECONDS MISS GONZALEZ IT'S BEEN AMENDED IN WAY THAT ACTUALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM WE WERE SEEKING TO SOLVE. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T AGAIN. SUBJECT OURSELVES TO MASSIVE MEASLES OUTBREAK I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. DAVIS HAS ALSO THE SERVICE AREA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN NOT SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I SAY THAT WITH QUITE A BIT OF. RELUCTANCE AND HESITATION BECAUSE AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE FIRST BILL. TWO SEVENTY SEVEN FOUR YEARS AGO I. AND EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF VACCINES ALL OF MY THREE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AND WILL CONTINUE BEING VACCINATED. YET THERE'S A BIT OF AN OVER REACH IN THIS BILL THAT I JUST CANNOT COME TO SUPPORT. COLLEAGUES WERE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A PERFECT LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS IMPENETRABLE. TO PROTECT A NOT SO PERFECT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SOME OF OUR VACCINATIONS HAVE NOT. BEEN UPDATED IN OVER FIFTY YEARS. SCIENCE IMPROVES ON A DAILY BASIS. WE HAVE HEARD IMMUNITY LEVELS OF 92% IN THE STATE. THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS HAVE GONE UP TO POINT 7% IT MEANS WE HAVE ALMOST EIGHT PERCENT. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT COMPLYING. WHY AREN'T WE SPENDING THE MONEY ON GOING AFTER THAT 8% THAT'S GONNA BUT CREATE A BETTER HEALTH OUTCOME AND IN FACT IT COULD POTENTIALLY GET US TO THE 9596% HERD IMMUNITY LEVELS THAT WE SEEK. EVER SINCE PASSING TO SEVENTY SEVEN. LA SCHOOLS HAVE IMPROVED BETWEEN 223% EVERY. EVERY SUB SUPERINTENDENTS DISTRICT IN LA WE HAVE SIX OF THEM HAS GONE UP. AND THEY'RE ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE THE WEST SIDE. THEY'RE ALL OVER YEARS TIME SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE SAID WE'VE SEEN TO SEVENTY SEVEN WORK. BUT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER. POINT 7% WHICH AS OF TWO MONTHS AGO IT WAS EXEMPTIONS OF. FORTY ONE FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS. WE'RE GONNA SPEND ALL THIS . IN ORDER TO HAVE CONTROL THIS IS AN ISSUE OF CONTROL NOW. BECAUSE THE SPOT IN THE AMONGST THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION. THERE AREN'T DOCTORS ON STAFF THAT ARE PUSHING FOR THIS. THEY'RE PAID LOBBYISTS. SO. AND BY THE WAY IF WE ARE GOING TO GO AFTER UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS. WE CAN HAVE MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. NOT CREATE A PROCESS THAT'S GOING TO COST US MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO DECLINE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SORRY MR MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO A HEADS UP IF I KNEW THERE WAS COMING UP TODAY BUT- THIS IS MY HEADS UP. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE I AM FULLY VACCINATED MY FAMILY IS FULLY VACCINATED. AND I BELIEVE THAT. WE DO NEED TO. PROMOTE VACCINATIONS SO THAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THE HERD IMMUNITY AT ALL SCHOOLS IN ALL COMMUNITIES. BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT WHILE THE GOAL AND INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT CALL. THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THAT IF THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE BAD ACTORS. THERE ARE ALSO TWO OTHER MAJOR CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. ONE WHICH I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH THE AUTHORED THE BILL DOCTOR PAN. WHICH IS. THE CONCERN ABOUT. A CHILLING EFFECT ON LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. YOU KNOW I AS A LAWYER I KNOW THAT. THAT IF I KNEW THAT I THAT IF I DID SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER INQUIRY AND A REVIEW. BY A PUBLIC AGENCY WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. THAT I WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY. AND AS DOCTOR PAN AND I WE BOTH. AGREED THAT. WE WANT TO PROMOTE AND SUPPORT LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THAT CHILDREN DON'T GET HURT. AND YET WHEN WE HAVE THIS THRESHOLD WHERE A DOCTOR ISSUING FOR. OR MORE THAN FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THAT THAT WOULD TRIGGER THE REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT INEVITABLY WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ESPECIALLY I'VE MET WAS SEVERAL PARENTS. BOB WHO HAD TO TAKE THEIR KIDS TO A GENETICIST OR AN IMMUNOLOGIST THESE SPECIALISTS WHO WERE WHO WERE IT RECEIVE THE REFERRALS FROM THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS YOU KNOW WHO SPECIALIZE IN THESE MORE. COMPLICATED OR NEW WANTS. CASES THE CASES IN THE GRAY AREAS AND A FOR THESE POSITIONS IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO GO BEYOND THE FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS A YEAR I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THIS THIS LIMIT ON THIS BILL IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING IMPACT ON LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND I FEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE BAD PUBLIC POLICY THAT MAY LEAD TO SOME CHILDREN. ARE BEING INJURED. LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS THE DATABASE. THE DATABASE NOW HAS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION GOING OF IT BEING COMPILED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL OF A PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEING ABLE TO BE SHARED WITH OTHER. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES. WHY DO WE NEED TO HAVE THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THERE I MEAN I THINK GIVEN ALL THE EMOTIONS ARE AND THE VOLATILITY OF THIS ISSUE THERE ARE PARENTS AS WELL AS POSITIONS THAT RAISED WITH ME. THE CONCERN ABOUT. BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR HAVING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION OR FOR ISSUING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. YOU KNOW I THINK. WE CAN IMAGINE YOU KNOW LIKE ANY OTHER DISEASE THAT. INVOLVES SENSITIVE INFORMATION SAY LIKE HIV IF THERE WAS A HIV DATABASE WITH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. I THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN I DON'T SEE THE REASON WHY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTOR PHYSICIANS WHY DO WE NEED TO COMPILE A DATABASE OF CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS THIRTY SECONDS WAS MEANT THAT CONTAIN THAT THAT THAT NAY SUBJECT THEMSELVES THAT THEY MAY BE SUBJECT. TO UNLAWFUL OR INAPPROPRIATE ACCESS TO HACKING. BOTTOM LINE I THINK THIS BILL IS OVER BROAD IT'S THE RIGHT POLICY GOAL BUT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION. I ASK MY COLLEAGUES NOT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. MR OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWO SEVENTY SIX I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR I AM A FAN OF VACCINATION I BELIEVE IN VACCINATION. VACCINES ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND THEY HAVE MADE A GREAT MEDICAL PROGRESS FOR OUR CIVILIZATION THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS. BUT. I DON'T THINK EVEN THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WOULD NOT ARGUE THAT VACCINES. ARE WHOLLY WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. WHEN THE TIME CAME TO CHOOSE FOR MY OWN CHILDREN WHETHER NOT TO VACCINATE MY WIFE AND I HAD A CAREFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AND WE DECIDED THAT VACCINATION WAS APPROPRIATE. AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION. HOWEVER SOMETIMES VACCINATION HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND I HAD A MEETING WITH A WOMAN EARLIER THIS YEAR IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE A CONSTITUENT OF MINE WHO MADE THE DECISION OF ACTION I HER DAUGHTER. THE NEXT DAY HER DAUGHTER WOKE UP AND COULD NOT WALK. AND SHE SPENT THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS IN PHYSICAL THERAPY LEARNING HOW TO WALK AGAIN THAT IS TERRIFYING. NOW I REALIZE THAT THAT HAPPENS RARELY BUT IT DOES HAPPEN. AND SO THE DECISION TO VACCINATE IS SOMETHING THAT PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE. THE CHOICE. THIS BILL TAKES THAT DECISION AWAY FROM PARENTS DOWN MOST CORROSIVE LEE IT SENDS THE MESSAGE TO PARENTS. THAT THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE DECISIONS THAT INFLUENCE THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHILDREN AND WE KNOW THE PARENTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIFE. WE NEED TO TRUST THEM TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT. THE LACK OF VACCINATION AND THE LOW VACCINATION RATES IN SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS THEN I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT EDUCATING PARENTS ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS ABOUT VACCINATION ABOUT DISPELLING SOME OF THE MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT VACCINATION. AND GIVING PARENTS THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION THIS IS NOT THAT RIGHT TOOL I URGE A NO VOTE ON SB TWO SEVENTY SIX. DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I COME FROM A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND. AND AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND IT'S DISTURBING TO ME THAT SOME HAVE LOST FAITH IN SCIENCE AND IN THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. I KNOW SET TO SAY SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS ABOUT A LOT OF EMOTION. I AND HOWEVER THE BILL AS IT'S AMENDED I BELIEVE IT PROTECTS THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. IT PROVIDES AN APPROPRIATE PROCESS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FROM DOCTORS WHO ABUSE THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION PROCESS AND GIVE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY AND PROTECT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LIVE. WORK AND WORKING UNITY IMMUNITY IS AT RISK. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THOSE WILL BE PROTECTED IN THIS BILL. THE I WOULD. RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OF WHO'S SPOKEN ABOUT THIS I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT SOME COMMUNITIES WHERE THE IMMUNIZATION RATE IS VERY VERY LOW. SO WHY YOU HAVE MADE MAYBE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY OR OR LOS ANGELES WE HAVEN'T IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. AND THE EDUCATION PART IS A CHALLENGE. THE ASSERTION THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM HAS BEEN HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. YEAH WE HEARD IN OUR HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARING. A LOT OF PARENTS WHO SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT. WE SIMPLY HAVE LOST FAITH IN SCIENCE AND I I'M I AM DISTURB BY THAT. WHILE NO BILL IS PERFECT I BELIEVE THIS BILL MAKES GREAT STRIDES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE AS MEDICAL PROVIDERS PROVIDE INFORMATION ALL THE TIME EVERY TIME I DID A PROCEDURE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES HAVE THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT. IF YOUR MEDICAL PROVIDER DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YOUR PATIENT. HEDGING YOUR BETS WERE FUDGING MAYBE FORGET YOU OR JUST YOU KNOW LET ME JUST DO THIS SO THAT I YOU KNOW THAT SO WE CAN MOVE ON. NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BY YOUR PATIENCE. YOU SHOULD HAVE NO FEAR IF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WANTS TO LOOK AT YOUR EXEMPTION. AND THERE WILL BE AN APPEALS PROCESS AS WELL. SO IT'S NOT THE END OF THE ROAD. AND THE GOAL IS THAT YOU KNOW I MY HOPE IS THAT PARENTS WILL HAVE A HAVE A- HAVE A ROLE IN THAT AS WELL. MY BIGGEST FEAR IS NOT MEASLES. MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THE NEXT THING THAT COMES ALONG MAYBE IT'S PER TOSSES MAYBE IT'S SOME OTHER DISEASE THAT WE HAVE ALL FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A RADIC HATED. DO WE NEED TO GO BACK THERE I DON'T BELIEVE WE DO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD THIS MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWO SEVENTY SIX. AND. THEY THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS TO GET INTO WE COULD TALK ABOUT GIVING MORE POWER TO ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND THE CURRENT BACKLOGS WITH THE ENVY DOJ AND THE FACT THAT EVERY SINGLE AGENCY THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY HAS A BACKLOG IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME TO THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BACK LOG ON GETTING APPROVAL. FOR OUR KIDS. NOW. YOUR KNOWN I'M A FATHER WITH A CHILD WITH SPINA BIFIDA. CHILDREN WITH SPINA BIFIDA. THE ESSENTIALLY WHEN THEY TELL YOU. THE LIST OF THINGS YOUR CHILDREN IS NOT ALLERGIC TO IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE LIST OF THINGS THAT THEY ARE ALLERGIC TO. AND GOING TO GET MY SON VACCINATED LIKE I'VE GOT ALL MY OTHER CHILDREN VACCINATED ANDAS I'VE SAID BEFORE ON THIS FLOOR. THE ENTIRE FAMILIES VACCINATED THE CATS THE DOGS THE HORSES EXEDRA. ARE VACCINATED IT'S NOT ABOUT VACCINES IT'S ABOUT CHOICE IT'S ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO SCHEDULE THINGS OUT. MY SON JUST STARTED T. K. THIS YEAR. AND BECAUSE OF HIS I. E. P. FOR SCHOOL HE'S STILL ABLE TO GET STATE. BUT HIS TWIN SISTER EIGHT NO THERE WAS THERE WAS ONE SHE DIDN'T GET TO START SCHOOL UNTIL WE WENT RESTORATION AND GOT HER INTO GET ANOTHER VACCINE. JUST OVER ONE. IN THAT'S RIGHT NOW THAT'S EVEN BEFORE THIS. THE FACT THAT WE'RE GETTING INTO THESE CONVERSATIONS OF. A GOOD DOCTOR VERSES A BAD DOCTOR THESE GUYS ARE JUST DOING IT FOR THE MONEY WHAT WHAT I FIND EXTREMELY IRONIC IS DURING THE DAYS OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA PRESCRIPTIONS NOBODY IN THIS BODY BATTED AN EYE. OVER DOCTOR SIGNING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR MARIJUANA NOT ONE WIN PASS ANYTHING ON THAT THAT WAS OKAY I WAS COOL. GRANTED IT'S LEGAL NOW SO WHATEVER. BUT NOBODY BATTED AN EYE THAT ABOUT BAD DOCTORS WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS. SO NOW ABOUT HERD IMMUNITY WERE WORRIED ABOUT SUCH A SMALL PERCENTILE. THAT IT'S WORTH INCREASING OUR BUDGETS TO A STATE AGENCY WITH NO GUARANTEE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SCREW IT UP. I LINE A LOT OF THE SENTIMENTS WITH THE MEMBER FROM SAN MARINO VALLEY IN BIG BEAR AND THESE OTHER AREAS WE NEED TO DO. MORE ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SITE. MY MEMBER FROM WHAT WHY HUMBOLDT MENTIONED YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET THE EDUCATION OUT OF SPECIAL ROLE AREAS I REPRESENT THE THIRD LARGEST DISTRICT ONE OF THE MOST RURAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. AND WE DO HAVE TO DO MORE ON THE EDUCATION SIDE WITH THROWING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO INCREASE THE BUDGET OF A STATE AGENCY MEMBERS THIS ISN'T GOING TO HELP US. THIS IS JUST GONNA HARM BILLS WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP. IN INTEL WE'VE GET THESE BACKLOGS AND ALL OUR DEPARTMENTS FIXED DMV FIX. DOJ FIXED I DON'T HAVE ANY FAITH. IN ANY OF THESE AGENCIES GETTING ANY MORE MONEY OR GIVING PE MAKE SPECIALLY OR SOMETHING AS SENSITIVE AS VACCINES THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT BELONG IN THAT RELATIONSHIP. IT NEVER HAS THERE'S ALREADY LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO GO AFTER BAD DOCTORS AND I THINK WE'D BE BETTER OFF TAKING OUR TIME TO USE THOSE. INSTEAD OF SAYING HELL THE ANSWERS BIG GOVERNMENT MORE MONEY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS DOCTOR QUIRK MEMBERS IF YOU LIKE WE RECOGNIZE PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES RIGHT NOW. DOCTOR QUIRK. YES IF YOU ALLOW. PARENTS TO. VOLUNTARILY BY GETTING A FAKE. MEDICAL EXEMPTION OUGHT NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR KIDS. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE CREATING FREE RIDERS. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GONNA TAKE THE VERY SLIGHT RISK OF A VACCINE. AND THEN HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF HURTING THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY DO DESERVE THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BY MAKING IT MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT MEASLES OR ANOTHER DISEASE PRINT TOSSES. ARE BECOMES A THREAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO I ASK YOU NOT TO ALLOW FREE RIDERS THANK YOU. A DOCTOR QUIRK REST GALLAGHER DIRECTNESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS YEAH I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE YES WERE CONSIDERING THIS BILL TO HEAR. FROM SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND- I RECEIVED THIS LETTER. YOUR RECENTLY FROM A YOUNG LADY THAT I GREW UP WITH. AND I NEVER REALLY KNEW HER HER STORY UNTIL. SHE SENT ME THIS LETTER AND I JUST WANT TO READ TO YOU A PART OF THIS PERMISSION TO READ MISTER SPEAKER WITHOUT OBJECTION. SHE WRITES MY FAMILY'S CHOICES ARE RIDICULED RIDICULED CONSTANTLY ON NEWS STATIONS SOCIAL MEDIA TV SHOWS AND MOVIES. ALL THESE OUTLETS ARE TELLING ME THAT VACCINES ARE COMPLETELY SAFE. THEY TELL ME MY CHILD WILL BE JUST FINE. TELL ME THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE MILD AND VERY RARELY. UNEDUCATED AND DON'T KNOW SCIENCE. AND I'M GETTING MY INFORMATION FROM FACEBOOK THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT A DOCTOR I CANNOT POSSIBLY MAKE THIS DECISION FOR MY CHILDREN. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. THE FACT IS I AM VERY EDUCATED ON THIS TOPIC AND HOW IT MAY SPECIFICALLY AFFECT MY FAMILY AFTER HUNDREDS OF HOURS REVIEWING OUR MEDICAL HISTORY REVIEWING CDC'S WEBSITE READING VACCINE INSERTS AND SPEAKING TO DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WE HAVE DECIDED AND BEEN ADVISED TO NOT VACCINATE OUR CHILDREN. AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FROM A LICENSE PEDIATRICIAN BECAUSE OF OUR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH. REACTIONS OF VACCINATIONS AND ARE FAMILY'S MEDICAL HISTORY. I SELF AND LIKE MOST OF THE MOMS AND PERRANCE. I KNOW AND HAVE DONE MUCH RESEARCH AND DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE MAKING A DECISION ABOUT VACCINATIONS EACH CHILD IS DIFFERENT. THEREFORE EACH DECISION IS DIFFERENT AS WELL. A BOARD CERTIFIED PEDIATRICIAN AND THE CDC OUR LARGEST RESOURCES AS WELL AS OTHER GOVERNMENT WEBSITES IN MAKING HEALTH RELATED CHOICES FOR MY CHILDREN. AS ALL PARENTS PROBABLY AGREE I WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO PROTECT MY CHILDREN. I SPENT HOURS STUDYING WAYS TO BETTER DEVELOP MY KIDS SKILLS TO HELP THEM GOING TO GOOD PEOPLE AND CONTRIBUTE IN A POSITIVE WAY TO SOCIETY. WHY WOULD I NOT TRY TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR MY CHILDREN WHY WOULD I NOT QUESTION A RESEARCH SUGGESTED BACK IN VACCINATIONS WHY WOULD NOT SEEK OUT MULTIPLE PHYSICIANS OPINIONS WHY WOULD I NOT READ. WHAT THE CDC HAS TO SAY ABOUT EACH VACCINE AS A MOM I WILL ALWAYS WEIGH THE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR MY CHILDREN. I WAS A COMPLETELY NORMAL GIRL AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN BEFORE THE GARDASIL VACCINE. I WAS DRIVING AND THEATER AND SPORTS. I LOVE HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS AND BEING INVOLVED IN CHURCH. I GOT MY SECOND ROUND OF A THREE PART VACCINE AND CAME OUT WITH A HEADACHE UNLIKE ANYTHING I'D EVER EXPERIENCE. AFTER A MONTH OF CONSISTENT HEADACHES MIGRAINES IN A MONTH OF SCHOOL I WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. I SPENT THREE DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL IN AN MRI SHOWED MY BRAIN WAS SWOLLEN. WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THE NEXT THREE IT WAS OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE. MY HAPPY GO LUCKY SELF WAS REPLACED BY A HOLLOW GIRL WHO CAN ONLY SEE DARKNESS. A MONTH AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL I WAS BEING ADMITTED. INTO AN EATING DISORDER REHAB AND BEING MEDICATED FOR DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER. NO ONE UNDERSTOOD WHY IT CHANGED SO DRASTICALLY MYSELF INCLUDED. SINCE THEN I'VE HAD I'VE BEEN MEDICATION FREE AND NEVER ONCE FELT THE WAY I DID THEN. HAS SPENT MANY YEARS DETOX IN MY BODY I KNOW THE GARLIC GARDASIL VACCINE BECAUSE THIS. YEAR'S LATER MY SISTER AND HER SON REQUESTED I GET A TEED UP. AND THE FLU SHOT I DID. I THOUGHT MY HEART WAS GOING TO STOP IT WAS BEATING SO FAST AND PAINFULLY I WAS TERRIFIED. I HAD BOTH OF THESE SHOTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND DAYS BUT THE SAME REACTION BOTH TIMES. WHEN MY HUSBAND AND THIS HAD THE SECOND ROUND OF MMR WHEN HE WAS ALMOST SIX AND SHORTLY AFTER. HE HAD HIS FIRST SHE'S SEIZURE. FROM THE TIME IS SIX TO THIRTEEN YEARS HE LIVED HIS LIFE WITH SEIZURES GOING TO THE DOCTOR CONSTANTLY FOR LABS AND TESS. THOSE SEVEN YEARS CHANGE HIS LIFE AND LIMITED HIS DESIRES AND CAPABILITIES AS A CHILD. THESE SIDE EFFECTS THAT MY HUSBAND AND I. HAD HAD TO THESE VACCINES ARE LISTED ON THE CDC'S WEBSITE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WITH SIMILAR STORIES TARS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. WITH ANY SMALL OR LARGE RISK WE TAKE IN LIFE THE AS US IN CALIFORNIA CITIZENS WE SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THESE CHOICES FOR OURSELVES. AND OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE- BUT I THINK YOU SEE. THIS IS A VERY REAL CHOICE AND THESE ARE PEOPLE MAKING VERY EDUCATED CHOICES ABOUT THEIR FAMILY. THIRTY SECOND THIS GALLAGHER THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S. STORY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET TOLD ENOUGH HER VOICE HASN'T BEEN HEARD ABOUT THAT IT HAS BEEN RIDICULED. AND I'VE HEARD IT RIDICULED IN THIS CHAMBER AND I'VE HEARD IT RIDICULED IN THESE HALLS. AND IT WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY LISTEN TO THESE VOICES TODAY THAT'S WHO WE ARE MAKING LAW FOR. PEOPLE JUST LIKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS TWO CHILDREN. AND IS RAISING THEM IN TRYING TO DO THE BEST SHE CAN FOR THEM EACH AND EVERY DAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE MAKING EDUCATED DECISIONS WHO OF EXPERIENCES. IN A VERY REAL WAY. NOT A NEBULOUS WAY BUT A VERY REAL WAY. NATIONAL CONSIDER THAT WE WERE CONSPIRING WE VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU MISS GALLAGHER. MISS WALDRON GARBAGE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS BEING SURPRISED AT THIS BILLS COMING UP TODAY I SCRIBBLED SOME NOTES SO I SAW THIS BILL IN HEALTH COMMITTEE AS WELL AND URGENT NO VOTE IF THIS BILL GOES BETWEEN THE DOCTOR AND THEIR PATIENTS IN THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT VACCINES IT'S ABOUT THE EXEMPTION PROCESS TO FILL CALIFORNIA SCHOOL VACCINE MANDATES. THE BILL IN AN UNPRECEDENTED WAY HANDS OVER THE JURISDICTION OF REVIEWING AND REVOKING THE MEDICAL OPINIONS OF PHYSICIANS FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INSTEAD OF A WHOLE SILLY AFFECTING DOCTORS MEDICAL OPINIONS WHY NOT JUST INVESTIGATE THE FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. I MEAN CERTAINLY WERE POINTING TO OF THE HANDFUL OF DOCTORS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHY ARE WE DOING THAT WHOLE SALIH AFFECTING PATIENTS ALL OVER THE STATE. HEARING FROM PARENTS WHO HAVE VACCINE INJURED CHILDREN. WHO ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR THAT CHILD FOR A SIBLING HOPING TO PREVENT ANOTHER VACCINE INJURY. AND THEY'LL THEY'LL BE UNABLE TO GET THAT GRANTED. WHILE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE DOCTORS IS NOT HOW HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE RUN IN OUR STATE. VACCINATION IS A HEALTH TREATMENT AND SO SERIOUS HEALTH TREATMENT LIKE OTHERS BECAUSE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF SIDE EFFECTS THERE'S ONE AS A PARENT I HAD TO SIGN THAT I AGREED TO ALLOW MY SON TO HAVE THE VACCINATIONS. SO IT'S A HEALTH TREATMENT GIVEN TO OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY WE NEED TO EMPOWER PARENTS WE NEED TO EMPOWER PHYSICIANS. IT'S ABOUT THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ORIGINAL. DOCTOR REGULAR DIRECTNESS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND YOU KNOW I TOO WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS BILL WAS GOING TO COME UP TODAY BUT I'M PROUD TO ADD MY VOICE AND SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IN MY THREE TERMS OF BEING HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE I'VE ONLY FOR ONE DAY SAT ON THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND IT WAS ONE SB TWO SEVENTY SIX CAME BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR. AND I WAS PROUD TO VOTE TO SUPPORT THAT BILL THEN BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK AND RATHER THAN MAKE A STATEMENT I ACTUALLY WANTS TO REFLECT ON THOSE QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK FOR TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS THIS A TOOL IN WHICH YOU NEED TO BETTER PURSUE YOUR GOAL AND THEIR ANSWER WAS YES AND SINCE THAT COMMITTEE HEARING THEY HAVE THEN COME ON TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HELP CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FAQS THE NATION'S FOR OUR STATE AND THAT'S WHY I ASK YOU SUPPORT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX TODAY THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU ARAMBULA MUCH COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZE MEMBERS OF THE LIKELY RECOGNIZE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW I WILL MAKE THIS VERY SHORT IN APRIL SOME COLLEAGUES THIS ROOM AND I WERE IN EUROPE WE TOWARD THE WILL OF WORLD HEALTH. ORGANIZATION LISTEN THE TOP DOCTORS IN THE. YOU GO ON AMAZON THERE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCURATE INFORMATION IS ARE MEDICAL DOCTORS TALKING. OKAY IT'S NOT OF US HERE. THAT'S A BIG ISSUE WORLDWIDE AND MISINFORMATION THAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST ISSUE. IS THAT THE PEOPLE LOOK TO THE INTERNET TURTLES THINGS. AND THEY'RE SO MANY BOOKS OUT THERE THAT HAVE BAD INFORMATION THAT'S A BIG ISSUE WITH THAT HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT. INFOS BELIEVE WHAT THEY READ ON THE INTERNET. THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME. BUT A LOT OF FOLKS DO BELIEVE IN THAT AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE WORLDWIDE RIGHT NOW THE VACCINE HASN'T TO SEE THAT'S PRETTY HEAVILY OF DOCTORS TALKING ABOUT THAT. IN ADDRESSING THAT. THANK YOU MISS COOPER MS REYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. LIKE MANY OF YOU I ALSO MET WITH MANY OF MY- CONSTITUENTS. IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE AND ALSO HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I MET WITH MANY PARENTS AND PEDIATRICIANS. POST THE SP TWO SEVEN SIX. THE STORIES FROM THESE PARENTS REGARDING THEIR CHILDREN WERE HEARTBREAKING. PARENTS WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN. THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT. I ALSO MET WITH MANY PARENTS. AND PEDIATRICIANS. IN FAVOR OF THE PROTECTIONS BEING OFFERED BY THESE VACCINATIONS. ONE OF THE MOTHERS ASKED ME SHE SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHY IS IT. THAT I CANNOT SEND TO MY CHILD WITH THE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH TO SCHOOL. BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN WITH PEANUT ALLERGIES YET YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME THAT I SHOULD TAKE SEND MY CHILD TO SCHOOL AND KNOW THAT THEIR OTHER CHILDREN WOULD NOT BEEN VACCINATED. WHERE IS WHERE IS THE PROTECTION THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT THEIR. AFTER MEETING WITH THE PARENTS AND WITH THE PEDIATRICIANS I TALK TO THE AUTHOR I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE MOMENTS I ALSO SPOKE TO THE CHAIR FROM OUR- HEALTH COMMITTEE. I LEARNED ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE BEING OFFERED IN THE WERE BEING ACCEPTED WHICH PROVIDED GREATER PROTECTIONS FOR PARENTS. SEEKING THESE EXEMPTIONS. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS MORE BEING DONE IN AMENDMENTS TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR PARENTS. WHO WANT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AB EXPECTED THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE ALSO GOING TO BE PROTECTED. WE TALK ABOUT CHOICE WE TALK ABOUT DECISIONS BEING MADE BY PARENTS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT A DECISION IN THE CHOICE MADE BY ONE PARENT. COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OTHER CHILDREN ON KNOWINGLY. THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN FOR ME. I WANT TO EMPOWER THE PARENTS I WANT TO EMPOWER PEDIATRICIANS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED WHEN THEY DO GO TO SCHOOL. FOR THIS I URGE AN AYE VOTE. MS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MEMBERS ARISES A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND A GRANDMOTHER. SB TWO SEVEN SIX IS ABOUT PROTECTING MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN WHO CANNOT GET BACK CITY VACCINES FROM THOSE WHO SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO GET VACCINES. UNDER THIS BILL AN EXEMPTION THAT IS GRANTED FOR A TRULY NECESSARY MEDICAL REASON WILL HAVE NO ISSUES. THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED ON THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENTS AND A STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR DUE PROCESS. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. I URGE OF FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL DEBATE MEMBERS. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE. I'M GONNA TRY TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT I HEARD I'M SORRY MY. I AM NOT A DOCTOR BUT MY HANDWRITING APPEARS LIKE ONE. FIRST I TOO AM SURPRISED THAT WERE TAKEN UP THIS BILL TODAY SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE SURPRISED. THAT HAPPENS. FIRST VACCINES ARE CONTINUALLY CONTINUALLY EVALUATED IN MONITORED THROUGH THE VACCINE DATA SAFETY. GROUP AFTER PAN I AND THEY HAVE BEEN SO IT'S NOT AS A FIFTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A VACCINE PUT OUT WE'VE NEVER MONITORED THE SAFETY OF IT AS WELL. AGAIN THERE OVER A HUNDRED SCHOOLS. THAT DIPPED BELOW THE 90% COMMUNITY IMMUNITY RIGHT AND ONE LOWER THAN FIFTY. I WANNA BE CLEAR A CHILD THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS CONSIDERED VALID UNTIL IT'S NOT SO FOR A CHILD HAS A MEDICAL IN A MEDICAL EXEMPTION NO MATTER WHAT REASON IT EVEN IF IT GETS EVALUATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT CHILD GETS TO STAY IN SCHOOL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS EVEN APPEAL PROCESS UNTIL ITS FINAL SUCH IMPORTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BACKLOG WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT THE BACKLOG IS IN FAVOR OF THE CHILD STAYING IN SCHOOL. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE. THIS BILL. IS SPONSORED BY DOCTORS. AND IT'S SUPPORTED. BY PEDIATRICIANS. IMMUNOLOGIST ONCOLOGIST THEY ALL WANT THIS BILL. THEIR ORGANIZATIONS WANT THIS BILL. YES YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A DOCTOR TO WHO DOESN'T BUT LET'S BE CLEAR WHO IS SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION. MOST DOCTORS WANT THE RIGHT THING TO BE DONE. AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO REMEMBER. IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD AND I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MEDICAL BOARD KNOWS THAT THEY CAN'T INDIVIDUALLY GO SEEK OUT DOCTORS TO WRITING EXEMPTIONS WITHOUT PARENTS COMPLAINING THE PARENTS ARE SEEKING THESE EXEMPTION SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A COMPLAINT. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DRIVEN IN THE SAME WAY. AS FAR AS THE DATABASE I KNOW THERE IS SOME CONCERN. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DOES HAVE A DATABASE ON HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS ON STDS AND I'M CANCER. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING NEW SO I KNOW THERE WAS CONCERN BEING BROUGHT UP LIKE WHAT WE DO THIS ON OTHER DISEASES GUESS WHAT WE DO. IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO KEEP THE VAST MAJORITY OF US SAFE FROM COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT DISEASES. AS THEY COME UP. WE ALSO HAVE THE OPIOID. DATABASE AS WELL THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THIS FOR VOTED FOR. THE INDIVIDUALS ALSO ALREADY SHARE IT WITH THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT HOPEFULLY THEY REALIZE THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO HACKABLE JUST LIKE YOUR INSURANCE. DEPART COMPANIES DATABASE JUST LIKE YOUR DOCTORS DATABASE. SO I UNDERSTAND NONE OF US WHAT LIKE THAT IDEA OF OUR CHILDREN'S MEDICAL HISTORY BEING HACKABLE. BUT IT'S THERE AND IT'S ALREADY THERE. I'M NOT A DOCTOR. AND I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF DOCTORS IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'M A MOM. AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT. THIS BILL. IN TWENTY TEN. WE HAD TEN DEBTS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE A WHOPPING COUGH TEN BABIES DIED. THAT THAT'S AGREED BY EVERYBODY THE DOCTORS THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES THE AUTOPSIES THEY DIED FROM WHOOPING COUGH A PREVENTABLE DISEASE. I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY THAT I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BRING UP MY FAMILY'S MEDICAL HISTORY BUT I'M GOING TO BECAUSE I. MY DAUGHTER ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP ON TWITTER YOU SHOULD KEEP HER CHILDREN OF TWITTER. AND SO. SHE BROUGHT IT UP IN PEOPLE START ASKING QUESTIONS ALMOST ACCUSATORY BUT I HAVE A NEPHEW WHO HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. NOW LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS. I HAVE A NEPHEW THAT IS IMMUNO COMPROMISED HIS A WHITNEY A PROBLEMS IT IS PROBABLY SPENT A QUARTER OF HIS LIFE. IT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. WE DEAL WITH THIS ALL THE TIME. HIS MOTHER WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN FOR HIM TO BE IMMUNE AYE IMMUNIZED AGAINST EVERY DISEASE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HE GOT EVERY DISEASE. THIRTY SECONDS THE DOCTOR SAYS NO HE CANNOT HAVE Y. VACCINATION SO HE CAN'T BE IMMUNIZED AGAINST MEASLES OR CHICKENPOX. EVERY TIME IS NOT IN THE HOSPITAL HE WANTS TO BE AT SCHOOL. BUT THOSE DISEASES. COULD KILL HIM. DEFINITELY HE'LL END UP BACK IN THE HOSPITAL. THESE ARE THE CHILDREN THE TRULY MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN THAT WERE TRYING TO PREVENT FROM GETTING THESE DISEASES AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. I KNOW PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AND I KNOW ALL THE OPPOSITION IS JUST ABOUT LOVING YOUR CHILDREN. I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT. A LOT OF US ARE MAMA BEARS. BUT BEING A MAMA BEAR MEANS PROTECTING THOSE KIDS WHO NEED THE PROTECTION THE MOST. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK WAS CONSULTS WITH THAT CAR GLOBAL THE ROLE.
