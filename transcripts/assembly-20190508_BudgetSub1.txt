TWO DANIEL SABINO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENTS RECOGNITION OF THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE. AND THE FUNDING THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TO BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION THANK YOU. SING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENTS LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS YES MOST FRAZIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR THIS PROPOSAL AS FAR AS UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR FOSTER CHILDREN HAVE A DESPERATE NEED WINTERS TRAUMA -- I'M MY CONCERN IS THAT AGAIN -- WE HAVE SUCH AN BASED ON THE RATE STUDY IN. HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN MARCH. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTFALL OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR THE ID DEPOPULATION [inaudible] WE OF UTILIZED THE REGIONAL CENTERS AS OUR STAFF HAS STOP GAP. FOR EVERYTHING THAT. AND THE INSURERS WON'T DO. FOR THE ID POPULATION WE HAVE CASELOADS FULLER SERVICE COORDINATORS -- SUMMER. NINETY THREE TO ONE EVEN OVER A HUNDRED I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE -- BUT WE'VE ALREADY TAXED. THESE REGIONAL CENTERS WITH A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THAT WERE NOT SHORT CHANGING THIS POPULATION. OF BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE ONLY PLACE WE CAN GO -- I HAVE WAITING LISTS. OVER OVER A YEAR. FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING SERVICES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. WHAT ASSURANCES DO YOU GIVE ME THAT YOU HAVE THE? ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THE PROVIDERS. THAT WE CAN'T GIVE TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE'RE GONNA NOW ADD MORE. RESPONSIBILITY AND NEED. FOR THESE FOSTER SHOWN WHO'S SUFFERED FROM BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM GOING IN THERE. AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT A WAITING LIST IN THIS SITUATION. SO HOW DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT. THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CURRENTLY HAVE CHIU INSURER -- TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICES AND TO COORDINATE WITH A SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS EFFORT. AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS THE FUNDING FOR THE POSITIONS FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE LOW IT ALLOWS US. THAT. BROADER VIEW IF YOU WILL AND THE FOCUSED-- RESOURCES TO REALLY WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE ARE THOSE GAPS SOMETIMES THE GAPS ARE JUST AN INFORMATION YOU KNOW SO COMING TOGETHER AND SHARING WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. WHAT'S ON SERVICES MIGHT MEET A PARTICULAR NEED ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO MAYBE CRISIS SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE AND SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS EFFORT -- IT WILL IMPROVE THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ARE YOU TO PLAN WHO HAVE SUSTAIN TRAUMA. SO WE ALREADY HAVE OTHER ISSUES SOLANO COUNTY IS ONE OF MY OF COUNTIES IN MY DISTRICT. WE DON'T HAVE A PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CRISIS SITUATION -- BEDS THERE'S NOT. SO. IF GOLDEN GATE. WERE ABLE. TO THERE'S NO WITH NO ORDER REFER. TO THERE'S NOT A PEDIATRIC CRISIS BUT SO. I THINK THAT I'M SAYING IS. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESSES IN IN A DIFFERENT FASHION WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITIES. IN THE PROVIDER MODEL. YOU CAN DO IT ADMINISTRATIVELY ALL DAY LONG WHO. BUT I'M GOING OUT AND HITTING THE WEEDS IN TALKING TO THE PROVIDERS THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE BLACK. CAN SO IF YOU TAKE HIS RESPONSIBILITY GOTTA TELL ME THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION. BECAUSE THIS ONE COUNTY NOT GOING. TO THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY. YOU'RE GONNA GO TO NORTH BAY REGIONAL NORTH BAY HOSPITAL. AND YOU GONNA GET A FIFTY ONE FIFTY IF BEST FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS. AND IF FAN THAT -- EXPIRES THEN YOU CAN GO TO JUVENILE HALL. HOW DOES THIS FIX THAT? WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM THROUGH THIS EFFORT HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE. THAT THROUGH THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS COMING TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT WHERE THEIR BREAKDOWNS IN COMMUNICATION WHERE THERE ARE -- GAPS IN THE SERVICES WHERE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES AND BY US IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE FIRST OF ALL I DO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. MORE EXPEDIENT AND BETTER SERVICES TO TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. AND I HAD A BILL I THINK WAS LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE THAT ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO REQUIRE ALL THESE AGENCIES TO TALK. AND IT WAS NOT SUPPORTED -- AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ADVANCING THAT NOW.

FOUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR POPLAR ACTING DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL SERVICES. FEATURED BANKER CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. IN ORDER THE TAG TEAM A LITTLE BIT HERE ALL SPEAK TO THE FIRST ISSUE WHICH IS THAT -- INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS IN CHILD CARE HOMES LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET ACTION ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE SOME OF THE GOVERNOR. THE BUDGET INCLUDED TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR AND FOR NEXT YEAR IN ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDS WERE CCD BG. TO DO ANNUAL INSPECTIONS THIS REQUEST SIMPLY PUTS THE POSITIONS TO GO WITH THE DOLLARS -- THE CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT IS A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CHANGES ADOPTED TO THAT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ONE OF WHICH REQUIRED THE ANNUAL CHILD CARE LICENSING WE HAD CURRENTLY BEEN ATTY EVERY THREE YEAR INSPECTION FOR A CHILD CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHICH HAD INCREASED FROM JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS IT FIVE YEARS. SAID THIS FUN THESE FUNDS WILL GIVE US THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES ALONG WITH THE POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AT ALL OF OUR CHILD CARE FACILITIES WHICH ARE APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND IN THE STATE TODAY. ON ISSUE NUMBER ARE WELL DONE FOR B. HOW YEAH SAME ISSUE LEYVA TRIP MYSELF SORRY -- HOUSING TEAM IS IS PROUD TO OPERATE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE VITAL SUPPORTS TO PEOPLE EITHER SEEKING SSI BENEFITS TRYING TO REUNITE OUT OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WITH FAMILIES OR SIMPLY TO STABILIZE THEIR THEIR FAMILIES LIVING SITUATION AND THE THREE PROGRAMS LISTED. IN YOUR AGENDA. BUT WE'RE NOW -- OPERATING ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PROGRAMS -- IN THIS VEIN AND WE'RE DOING THAT WITH ONLY THIRTEEN PEOPLE ACROSS THIS MANY PROGRAMS -- THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFICULTY IN OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OVERSIGHT TO THOSE PROGRAMS. AND ONE OF THE POSITIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS A RESEARCH PROGRAM SPECIALIST TO ASSIST WITH THE EVALUATION OF THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM -- WHICH IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN SEEING. AFTER A ROUGHLY AT THIS POINT TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF OPERATION -- SO. LOOKING LOOKING FOR THAT THE SUPPORT WE NEED TO TO DO RIGHT BY THESE PROGRAMS AND MAKE THEM AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY REALLY NEED TO BE [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. THE THIRD ISSUE. FISCAL. COUNTY AND COUNTY OVERSIGHT OF COUNTY OPERATIONS -- FOR THIS WE ARE ASKING TO INCREASE OUR OUR REIMBURSEMENTS AS WELL AS OUR FUNDING FOR THIS TO GET FIVE NEW POSITIONS DO FISCAL MANAGEMENT. THIS CALL MONITORING AND COUNTIES WE'VE CURRENTLY BEEN UNDER DIRECTION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE NOT DOING ADEQUATE MONITORING OF OUR COUNTY FISCAL OPERATIONS. THESE ARE SIMILAR TO BUT NOT EXACTLY AUDITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S PASSED THROUGH THE STATE. GOES DOWN THE LOCAL. LEVEL IS BEING EXPENDED CORRECTLY THEY WOULD LIKE US TO MONITOR MORE AT BEING THESE FIVE POSITIONS WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND THAT -- TO A LEVEL WHERE THE FAITHFUL FIND IT ACCEPTABLE THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. SENATE HAMMER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME. OUR WORDS PER MINUTE PLANTS NOTHING ELSE TO ADD. CHECK YOU ARE AFFECTING BEING RIGHT EXACTLY. CHECK A ROSIER ELIA WE REVIEWED ALL THREE OF THE ITEMS NO MAJOR CONCERNS -- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND FINANCE ON A TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT -- BE AND WITH A SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD JUST LIKE FOR MEMBERS IS -- WHILE THE PROPOSAL IT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IS BEING FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS THERE'S QUESTIONS IN FUTURE YEARS WHETHER THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE -- SUGGESTS MORE OF A A POINT OF A POTENTIAL ISSUES IN THE FUTURE OF HOW WE WOULD FUND THESE POSITIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. PUBLIC LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. SAYING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND THE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT THE COUNTY OPERATIONS SAID HOW DO YOU ENVISION. THAT -- TAKING PLACE. WE CURRENTLY DO -- MONITORING AND ALL OVER AND NOT WE DO MONITORING ALL OF OUR CURRENT FEDERAL PROGRAMS. BUT WE ONLY MONITOR A FEW COUNTIES HERE THIS WILL ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE MONITORING EACH YEAR WE BASICALLY GO IN AND TO DESK ON ITS WILL RIPPLE ACTUAL FILES IN THE COUNTY WE DON'T DO THIS FROM SACRAMENTO. WE GO DOWN TO VISIT COUNTIES IN ORDER -- TO REVIEW THEIR EXPENDITURES AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CLAIMING IS DONE APPROPRIATELY THAT THE PROPER SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED AND THAT ALL THE DOLLARS LINE UP WITH WHAT WE HAVE ALLOCATED TO THEM IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO IN THAT. TYPE OF A SIMPLE AUDITING OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE THERE. WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS LARGE COUNTIES URBAN COUNTY SERVICE SUBURBAN -- IRVINE -- BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A 100% FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RIGHT IT'S YOU'RE CHOOSING CERTAIN ONES -- TO LOOK INTO THE OVERSIGHT THAT THEN GIVES YOU THE THE SAMPLING OF WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT WE WE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR FIRST SO WE LOOK AT THE LARGER COUNTY USE -- BY AND LARGE BUT WE ALSO LIKE TO LOOK AT THE SMALLER COUNTIES AS WELL ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SORT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM COUNTIES INCLUDED AS WELL. TO INSURE INSURE THAT THEY'RE DOING IT AND PROVIDE THE MANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NECESSARY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF THERE ARE FEDERAL THIS ALLIANCE IS IN A SMALL COUNTY IT ACTUALLY MATTERS -- YOU KNOW IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR A SMALL COUNTY. SO WE TRY TO HELP THEM BY DOING IT MAY INCLUDING THEM AS WELL. SO IN. AN INCREASING -- THE OVERSIGHT WE NOW GOING TO INCREASE THAT SAMPLE POOL ALSO GET COUNTIES. BY HOW MUCH. THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING ABOUT HOW TO HEAR ON MY ON MY SCREEN BECAUSE I HAD SOMETHING EARLIER TODAY -- AND I'M. OF COURSE HAD TOO MANY EMAILS TODAY -- WAS. ONE NINE REGRETTABLY NO -- TO HELP. OUT SEE IF THIS ONE HAS THE NUMBER OF HOW MANY AUDITS WERE DOING -- SIR -- THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY -- TO FROM TH WE WERE DOING -- FOR THIS WILL ALLOW US TO DO SIX COUNTIES EACH FISCAL YEAR -- AND IT ENSURES THAT WE CAN HAVE A CYCLE WHERE EVERY COUNTY WILL BE REVIEWED AT LEAST EVERY TEN YEARS. SPATTER. GET TO THE FIFTY YES. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WOW. WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS I I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE ADOPTION STATUTORY CHANGES THAT CONFORM AND REQUIRE ANNUAL. INSPECTIONS FOR CHILD CARE CENTERS AND FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES. CAN I ASK ADMINISTRATIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ARE IN A DRAFTING THIS LANGUAGE IN PREPARATION FOR US TO ADOPT THIS AFTER THE MAY REVISE CLOSE OUT HEARING. WONDERFUL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS COME HIS RUBIO JUST ON THE ANNUAL WEALTH -- THEM BACK UP ON THE WE DISCUSSED THE THE TEMPER POSITIONS ARE. MY CONCERN IS THAT. YOU ARE CORRECT WE DON'T HAVE WE CAN'T COUNT ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS BY HOW DO YOU RECRUIT FOLKS -- IF THE POSITIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- I'M GOING WE ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY HIRING PEOPLE IS PERMANENT -- THERE ARE THERE ARE COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING PROGRAM -- WHICH IN MOST OF THESE POSITIONS ARE NOT ALL OF THEM -- THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE INSPECTIONS THERE IS -- CONSIDERABLE TURNOVER AND THAT'LL POPULATIONS WERE HIRING THEM IS PERMANENT WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT -- THE FUNDING WILL CONTINUE BUT FOR MISSION THERE IT TAKES CARE YES PEOPLE RETIRE PEOPLE LEAVE -- SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT ZORBING THAT ENDED THOSE ADDITIONAL STAFF SO WE ARE HARD TO MISS PERMANENT POSITIONS OKAY SO THAT WE WON'T HAVE THOSE ISSUES AND THEN I KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED THE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND RIGHT NOW THERE IT'S EVERY THREE YEARS -- WHAT'S STOPPING US FROM DOING IT EVERY SINGLE YEAR CHILD CARE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE VERY CRITICAL OBVIOUSLY AND IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS -- WELL IT SAYS. THE OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL -- I DID SEE THE RESULT I'M RUNNING A BILL ON CHILD CARE SERVICES AND THERE IS A PARENT THE CONTEST TO FIND SAID THAT THERE WAS. AN INCIDENT THAT HER SON'S -- DAYCARE OR CHILD CARE -- PLACE AND HE END UP HOSPITALIZED AND HEMORRHAGED IN YOU KNOW A LOT OF ISSUES AND IF WE INSPECT EVERY THREE YEARS. YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT BEING MONITORED I MEAN IN MY OPINION IN OF THOSE POSITIONS LIKE -- THE OLD FOLKS. HOMES SHOULD HAVE A REGULAR VISIT JUST SO THAT WE ARE AWARE OF ANY ISSUES BECAUSE THESE ARE. YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLD PEOPLE NOT YET AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY BUT MY POINT IS THAT THESE ARE VULNERABLE KIDS AND SOME OF THEM. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TO SPEAK SOUL CAN WE TALK ABOUT POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE. OR SOON SOONER RATHER THAN LATER TO HAVE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AS OPPOSED TO EVERY -- COUPLE YEARS WELL THANKFULLY THAT'S WHAT THAT THAT FUNDING WILL PROVIDE IS IT WILL BE ANNUAL FOR THE NEXT THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND BY PUTTING ON IMPERIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ASKING RIGHT BUT IT'S TEMPORARY FIND NG. AND SOUL CAN YOU HELP US BE CREATIVE SO THAT. THE WAY YOU'RE BEING CREATIVE YOU KNOW AND AND USING THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE TO HIRE THESE FOLKS HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE. FINDING NOW TO MAKE THAT A PERMANENT. I ASIAN STEP ONLY FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS ONE OF THE THINGS THE WORKING. MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AND COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN REALLY TO REBUILD THE FOUNDATION OF LICENSING. AND TO WHICH HAD BEEN KIND OF DECIMATED DURING THAT THE THAT THE RECESSIONARY TIMES AND TO TRY AND DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS THAT CAN MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT AND STILL MORE -- FUNDING OR QUALITY -- WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR INSPECTIONS SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A NEW INSPECTION TOOL THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO DO A BETTER MORE THOROUGH JOB WHEN WE'RE DOING INSPECTIONS INSTEAD OF THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT NOW -- WHICH IS A A FAIRLY SHORT KEY INDICATOR TOOL WE'RE MOVING TO A MORE IN DEPTH. TOOL THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRILL DOWN ON THE AREA MORE THAT PROBLEM OCCURS A LOT MORE MORE QUICKLY FOR HOPING THAT IT THAT OVER TIME AS WE DEVELOPED AND WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THESE TOOLS NOW. THAT THAT WILL MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT IN OUR ABILITY TO DO IT THE MORE EFFICIENT THE WE CAN BE THE MORE TIME WE FREE UP SO IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE CAN SEE THAT EFFICIENCY ACTUALLY COMING TO FRUITION IN SEVERAL YEARS. THAT MIGHT HAVE SYSTEMS IN YOU KNOW SORT OF FREEING UP ADDITIONAL TIME TO DO MORE INSPECTIONS -- IN ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW FOCUSING ON PROVIDING QUALITY ASSISTANT OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS. TO HELP THEM BE IN COMPLIANCE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SITE FOR ONCE SOMETHING IS ALREADY GONE WRONG WE'RE TRYING TO DO A LOT MORE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP THE COMPLIANCE. THAT HELPS WITH HAVING FEWER COMPLAINTS -- BECAUSE BY BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FACILITY CAN RUN BETTER SO ALL OF THESE THINGS OVER TIME SHOULD BE ALLOWING US TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR STAFF AND THEREFORE HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY. BE ABLE TO CREATE SIMILAR TIME FOR INSPECTIONS WILL IT BE THIS MUCH THAT QUICKLY. I DO I WOULD NOT AT ALL OVER PROMISE THAT. THANK YOU IF YOU KNOW IF WE pCOULD BE AT ASSISTANCE OBVIOUSLY TO DO THAT PLEASE LET US KNOW SO THAT -- WE CAN SEE THIS AND NOBODY'LL NOTICE THAT WE'RE DOING IT EVERY YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU -- NO NO WE'LL JUST KEEP IT QUIET JUST BETWEEN ALL OF US HERE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU MENTION CITATIONS AND VIOLATIONS -- COULD YOU JUST FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES SHARE WITH US WHAT YOUR COMPLAINT -- TOTAL IS AND ALSO WHEN YOU'RE OUT WHAT YOUR CITATION OR VIOLATION. AVERAGES PER VISIT. I CAN SPEAK TO THE AVERAGE PER VISIT AND I CAN. GIVE OUR CHILD CARE -- A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR BEHIND ME WHO MAY HAVE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS BUT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY -- CITATIONS WE HAVE PER VISIT IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL ACROSS ALL PROGRAMS IT TENDS TO BE LESS THAN TO ANY PARTICULAR VISIT IN TIME. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A PARTICULAR FACILITY MIGHT HELP SEVERAL AND MY HAVE CERTAINLY MORE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS -- THAN OTHERS BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CITATIONS THAT ARE GIVEN OUT. ONE THE REASON I'M JUST TRYING TO VALIDATE THE THE ESSENTIAL REASON FOR HAVING THESE INSPECTIONS OF THE PROTECTION OF THE CHILDREN AND AND THEN YOU ARE FINDING. IN EVERY INSTANCE SOMETHING THAT WILL BENEFIT THE CHILD'S SAFETY OR IT WILL BE ABSOLUTELY -- AND I AND I DO AND I WHEN I SAY THAT THE YOU KNOW. THERE'S ONE OR TWO WHEN WE GIVE FROM CITATIONS THERE'S TWO TYPES OF CITATIONS WE TEND TO GET ONE OR THINGS THAT ARE AN IMMEDIATE RISK THOSE ARE CALLED TYPE A MEANING IT'S THAT. THAT CHILD RIGHT NOW IS AT RISK OF SOMETHING HAPPENING. THAN THE OTHERS IT'S A POTENTIAL RISK IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THIS PROBLEM IS THEN THAT CAN HAPPEN. AND WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE TYPE A BIT VIOLATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR -- IN ADDITION WE DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS WHICH BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT SUCH AN INFREQUENT -- INSPECTION -- INTERVALS DURING THE LAST DECADE OR SO -- WE HAVE A BECOME TO RELY MUCH MORE ON COMPLAINTS WHEN PEOPLE CALL IN TO SAY HEY SOMETHING'S GOING ON AT MY CHILD'S CHILD CARE THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED. AND WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THAT AND SO IT IT ALL KIND OF IS IT FITS TOGETHER IN ITS SYSTEM OF OF MAKING SHORT ENSURING HEALTH AND SAFETY SO. THESE L. P. A.'S THAT LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYSTS AT THAT DO THESE INSPECTIONS THEY ALSO DO ALL THAT OTHER WORK AND SO PROVIDING -- FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS SHOULD HOPEFULLY ALSO AND IN FEWER COMPLAINTS BECAUSE WE HAVE BETTER COMPLIANCE AND SHE WERE BAD THINGS HAPPENING THE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AFTER THE FACT. DULY NOTED THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER JUST FOR YOUR COMMENT ON TOTAL COMPLAINTS -- AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TOTAL COMPLAINTS WERE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE COMPLAINTS THAT ROLLED OVER FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. PERCY CL OVERALL ACROSS ALL FACILITIES. THANK YOU. I THINK THE THE ONE MESSAGE WHEN I HEAR IT FROM YOU AS WELL AS FROM THE MEMBERS IS ANNUAL EXPECT INSPECTIONS ARE A GOOD THING. AND I THINK THAT IN THE END WE ALL BENEFIT SO HEARING THAT FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE YOU KNOW THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE OTHER BUDGET REQUESTS. YOU SAY YOU TOLD ME YOU WANTED ANNUAL RICK ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. SO WITH THAT. YES DID YOU WANT TO SORRY THE TABLE WAS KIND OF FLOODING WHEN I GET GET UP THERE IS THE GAME PERMIT FINANCE. AS WENT OUT TO EXTENT THAT THERE IS WE ADOPTED ME IF WE DROP IT ME AND EXPECT IS ON GOING. GIVEN THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW TO PROVIDE THIS AND EXPRESSIONS FEDERAL FUNDING ONLY. THERE WILL BE A GENERAL FUND PRESSURE IN THE IN THE FUTURE JEFF ACOSTA OUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO -- ANYA EXPANSION ONCE DEBORAH FUND IS DEPLETED. HE TELLS ONE IN THE OUT YEARS THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED -- HEALTH CORRECT THE I DON'T NOT SURE HOW LONG HAVE THE FEDERAL FUNDING THE BILL FOR HOW LONG. THE TWO WE GOT -- TO BUCKETS IF YOU WILL OF THAT CCTV CHEAP FUNDING FROM A AND THIS CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET AND THEN AGAIN IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. EACH ONE OF THOSE BUCKETS IS IS CAN BE EXPENDED OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS BUT IF YOU WANTED TO CONTINUE DOING ANNUAL INSPECTIONS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TWO YEARS FROM NOW. THAT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD HAVE TO BEGIN TO BACK FILL THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THAT CONCLUDES OUR AT ISSUE NUMBER.

SIX PETER BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT I'LL TAKE THE LEAD ON SIX A AN IMMIGRATION -- IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE IMMIGRATION FUNDING AT OUT OF MUCH HIGHER ON GOING LEVEL -- WE WE ARE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS HERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK ACROSS THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE SUBSETS WITHIN OUR IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAM WERE ASKING. FOR SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THOSE PROGRAMS -- WE DO A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SITE VISITS TO OUR LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS WE PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM. IN HOW TO DO THIS BUSINESS WE DO A LOT OF CONNECTING THEM WITH EACH OTHER -- AND THAT KIND OF THAT ALREADY REQUIRES -- WARM BODIES TO IT TO DO ALL OF THAT WORK. ADDITIONALLY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTING WORKLOAD FOR US AT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL ON BOTH ON THE PROGRAM SIDE. AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE SO WE'RE ASKING -- FOR SOME POSITIONS TO FULLY SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AS WELL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU.

SEVENTY LEGACY SYSTEMS -- OUT THE DEPARTMENT THAT SUPPORT CRITICAL WORK THAT WE'RE DOING -- AND AS WE TRY TO MODERNIZE AND UPDATE THEM WE STILL NEED PEOPLE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK AND FUNCTION. AND SO THIS PROVIDES THE FUNDING FOR THAT BUT IT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE PLACES THAT WE FOUND FUNDING TO THIS NO. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE SWITCHED OVER TELECOM FROM ONE PROVIDER TO ANOTHER TO A VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL PROVIDER WHICH IS SAVED US A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR -- AS AS WE DO IT SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE PLACES WE WERE ABLE. TO BUY WERE WERE ALSO TRYING TO ELIMINATE OUR USE OF SOME RETIRED A NEW IT TENDS ON VARIOUS PROJECTS TO ACTUALLY HIRE STAFF BECAUSE HAVING STAFF IS MORE RELIABLE THAN RETIRED ANNUITANTS.
