MANUALS SO IT'S A VERY SIMPLE -- LAW THAT SAY -- AT THREE SIXTY IT IS TO BE ARE INCLUDED IN THE MANUALS. WELL WE WE HAVE EMPIRICAL DATA THAT WE HAVE A SPEAKER THIS SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT -- SIMPLY BY BUT I MEAN THE LAW TO THE MANUAL IT WOULD -- TRAIN OFFICERS ACCORDINGLY GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION. INFORMATION THEY NEED. TO IDENTIFY CASES OF ELDER ELDER ABUSE. AND BASIC GIVES GIVE SOME -- UP BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW TO TREAT THOSE CASES. IT'S TO THIS PINNACLE IS IS MEANT TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. MOST LOCAL LAWS IT ENFORCEMENT TUITIONS HAVE ELDER. OR DEPENDENT ADULT POLICIES TO FILL TWO REFERENCES PENAL CODE. WHICH MEANS THAT -- MANY OF THESE CASES ARE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED -- EVEN IF A IN IN THE CASES RELATING -- TO HOW A HOW THIS INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED -- ONE OF THE PRODUCERS OF MANUALS ALEXA POLL -- IT DOESN'T EVEN AT THIS TO THEIR TO THEIR MANUALS AND IT'S CREATING PROBLEMS FOR THE ELDERLY ELDER COMMUNITY. WE HAVE LEASE AGAIN AND WITH THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO. WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING THESE -- FEE NOT CODES IN SAN JOSE'S POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO'S DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS ISSUE AND I AT IF THE SHIRT CHAIR WOULD ALLOW. HER TO JUST PRESENT HOW THIS IS WORK SO THE SAN JOSE COMMUNITY I I HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART FOR THIS HOUSE AT LEAST BUY ME FLOWERS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY AND SENATE BILL. ELEVEN NINETY ONE MY NAME IS LISA GANON I'M LIEUTENANT WITH THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT I OFFER MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS I BELIEVE MANDATING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INCLUDE PENAL CODE THREE SIXTY EIGHT IN THE POLICY MANUALS. AS WELL AS IN THEIR TRAINING WILL ASSIST THOSE IMPROPERLY IDENTIFYING INSTANCES OF ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. IN THE LONG RUN THIS WILL HELP ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULT POPULATIONS THROUGH PROPER AND THOROUGH REPORTING. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN I WAS THE UNIT COMMANDER FOR THE FAMILY VIOLENCE UNIT WHICH INVESTIGATES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD ABUSE RESTRAINING ORDER VIOLATIONS AN ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. I WAS ASKED FIRE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW OUR POLICY AND IMPROVE ITS CONTENTS. I SPENT ALMOST NINE MONTHS WORKING ON THE PROJECT AS I CONSULTED WITH ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES IN THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE PROTOCOL WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE ONLINE. I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICY INCLUDED BEST PRACTICES FOR INVESTIGATING REPORTING AND CROSS REPORTING. ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE. FUND OF AMBER FIFTH TWENTY FIFTEEN I ROLLED OUT THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT TRAINING BULLETIN. AND A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY UPDATE TO EVERY OFFICER WORKING IN PATROL. THE TRAINING BULLETIN IN THE NEW POLICY CONTAINED CLEAR REFERENCES TO PENAL CODE SECTION. THREE SIXTY EIGHT IN THE YEARS TO FOLLOW I CHECKED WITH OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO SEE HOW MANY CASES OF ELDER ABUSE WERE BEING REPORTED. IN THE FIRST YEAR THEY DOUBLED IN THE SECOND YEAR THE NUMBER OF REPORTS TRIPLED. I BELIEVE THE INCREASE IN REPORTING IS DUE TO THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT BEING BETTER EDUCATED AS TO WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THE HOME AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTING SUSPECTED. AND ACTUAL ABUSE OR NEGLECT. DURING MY TIME THE FAMILY VIOLENCE UNIT I WAS FORTUNATE TO SERVICE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON A TRAINING VIDEO. WHICH WAS PUT OUT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICERS STANDARDS AND TRAINING ALSO KNOWN AS POST. THIS COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING VIDEO IS FREE TO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU BELONG TO POST. THE VIDEO FOCUSES ON SAFEGUARDING ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS IS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATION ON RESPONDING TO IN ASSISTING ELDERS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER ACCORDING. WELL MY EXPERIENCE AND EXPOSURE IS LIMITED TO THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT MY LAW ENFORCEMENT INTUITION TELLS ME THAT TRAINING AND AND EDUCATION OF FIRST RESPONDERS IS CRITICAL TO IDENTIFYING IN INTERVENING ON BEHALF OF ELDERS INDEPENDENT ADULTS.

LET'S JUMP RIGHT TO IT FILE ITEM ONE S. B. TEN TWENTY SIX US UNDER PLEASE PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- THIS MEASURE IS THE DIGNITY AT HOME ACT FALL PREVENTION. IT SEEKS TO ALLOW MORE SENIORS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS TO AGE IN PLACE. AND STAY IN THEIR OWN HOMES THROUGH THE USE OF SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE HOME MODIFICATIONS. THE REDUCE THE RISK OF FALLING. MEMBERS ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY IN CALIFORNIA TURNED SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. SENIORS HAVE A ONE IN THREE RISK OF FALLING. EVERY YEAR OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AND 33% OF ALL FALLS IN THE ELDERLY POPULATION INVOLVE HAZARDS AT HOME. FACTORS LIKE POOR LIGHTING LOOSE CARPETS AND A LACK OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT THINGS I GRAB BARS STAIR RAILS AND HI TOILETS. ARE A PARTICULAR RISKS. 80% OF THESE FALLS HAPPEN IN THE BATHROOM. THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO ISSUE GRANTS TO THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING FOR INJURY PREVENTION SERVICES IN THE HOME. FOR AS LITTLE AS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHICH IS THE COSTA FOR TWO DAYS IN A IN A HOME IN A SENIOR HOME. THE AVERAGE COST OF A MODIFICATIONS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A HOME CAN BE OUTFITTED. WITH SIMPLE THINGS LIKE GRAB BARS OR IMPROVED LIGHTING. THE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE LITERALLY FOR MANY SENIORS BETWEEN AGING IN PLACE. AND FACING A FUTURE OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION. MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE HOSPITALIZED EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF A FALL. MOST OFTEN DUE TO A BROKEN HIP OR HEAD INJURY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE DATA. DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS FOR FALLS WOULD PATIENTS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY TOTALED THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WITH MEDICARE PICKING UP ROUGHLY CALIFORNIA SURE OF THE SCOTS WAS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THIS TO ME IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS. WAY TO PUT AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION. AND EVEN THE POUND OF CURE BY THE WAY WAS SENIORS IS NOT NECESSARILY CARE. THIS IS A TO ME OF IN IMPORTANT BUT SIMPLE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THAT IS. WITHOUT QUESTION. AND WHEN YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE AGING AND THE RISK OF FALLS AND NUMBER OF FAWZI IMPACTS AND HAVE ON THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THIS IS JUST SIMPLY A A BILL WHOSE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE. AND WITH ME TODAY IS MAXINE MAN TELL. REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAXING MEANT HOW REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY. ANA IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY SIX MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ISN'T UNPREDICTABLE OFTEN DISABLING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. AND IT USUALLY DIAGNOSED WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIFE THE AVERAGE AGE OF ONSET IS THIRTY FOUR YEARS OLD. I BECAUSE MS CAN IMPAIR MUSCLE STRENGTH SENSATION BALANCE COORDINATION AND GATE. AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DISABLING FATIGUE PEOPLE LIVING WITH MF SOMETIMES FIGHT FIND IT NECESSARY TO MODIFY THEIR HOMES. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT OVER 50% OF PEOPLE WITH A MASS FALLING DOWN IN A THREE TO SIX MONTH PERIOD. AND 3250% HAVE FALLEN DOWN MULTIPLE TIMES. AND OVER HALF THE PEOPLE REPORT HAVING BEEN INJURED DUE TO A FILE. FILES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND INDEPENDENCE SOCIAL ISOLATION CONTROL COULD CURTAILMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND CHRIS INCREASED RISK OF MORE FALSE. AND INCREASED USE AND COST OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY INCREASED RISK OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SUCH AS GRAB BARS AND SHOWERS INNER TOILETS. GRAB RAILS ALONG STAIRS REYES TOILETS LOWERED LIGHT SWITCHES AND RANCID ENTRANCE DOORS ALLOW DISABLED INDIVIDUALS CONTINUED INDEPENDENCE. AND SAVES MONEY. BUT HOME MODIFICATIONS ALTHOUGH VITAL CAN BE ALSO EXPENSIVE AND OUT OF REACH FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. THE ASSESSMENTS REFERRALS AND RESOURCES PROVIDED THROUGH SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY SIX WILL BE OF TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO PEOPLE LIVING WITH MSF WITH M. ASSN THE MS SOCIETY URGES YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH A IS ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT BILL.

IF WE DON'T TAKE STEPS TO RECKON. ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF AGING IT'S GOING TO COST THE STATE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE. A AND I'D RATHER SEE US BY DOING THE PREVENTION AND PUTTING THE MONEY WE DO HAVE A INTO MORE CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING -- TO REALLY ADVANCE THE STATE BUT WE ARE AGING AND OUR SENIORS.
