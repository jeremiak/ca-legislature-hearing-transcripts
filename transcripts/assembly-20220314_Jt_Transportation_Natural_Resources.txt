FINALLY THE ASSEMBLY HAS UNFORTUNATELY WITNESSED A NUMBER OF DISRUPTIONS TO COMEDIAN FLOOR FOR SEEDINGS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE WILL NOT CON WE WILL NOT. ALLOW ANY CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS DISTURBS OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE THE ORDERLY CONDUCT OF THIS HEARING. THAT DISRUPTIVE CONTENT MAY INCLUDE TALKING ARE MAKING LOUD NOISES FROM THE AUDIENCE UTTERING LOUD THREATENING OR ABUSIVE LANGUAGE SPEAKING LONGER THAN THE TIME ALLOTTED EXTENDED DISCUSSIONS OF MATTERS NOT RELATED TO THE SUBJECT OF THE HEARING WHICH IS HYDROGEN. AND OTHER DESTRUCTIVE ACTS TO ADDRESS ANY DISRUPTIVE CONDUCT CONDUCT I WILL TAKE THE FOLLOWING STEPS IF IT INDIVIDUAL DISRUPTS OUR HEARING PROCESS I WILL DIRECT THEM TO STOP. AND WARNED THEM THAT CONTINUED DISRUPTIONS MAY RESULT IN REMOVAL FROM THIS BUILDING. I WILL ALSO DOCUMENT ON THE RECORD INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED AND THE NATURE OF THE CONDUCT I AM A TEMPORALLY TEMPORARILY HAVE TO RECESS THE HEARING. IF THE CONDUCT DOES NOT STOP I WILL REQUEST THE ASSISTANCE OF THE SERGEANTS AND EXCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL FROM THE CAPITOL BUILDING. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THE INFO AT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON COULD MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO VERYBODY ELSE TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT. SO THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE POLICY ISSUES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF HYDROGEN- LAST YEAR. I WAS HONORED TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE THE COP IN SCOTLAND IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATIVES AND HYDROGEN WAS A VERY LARGE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION- I WOULD NOT JUST FROM THE U. S. DELEGATION BUT FROM DELEGATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY CONSENT CONF A CONSIDERATIONS AS WE NAVIGATE OUR WAY TO A ZERO EMISSION AND CARBON NEUTRAL FUTURE AND CERTAINLY HYDROGEN WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THAT- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES IS A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ONE. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM TO STATE AGENCIES TASKED WITH ENSURING THAT WE MEET THE STATE'S ENERGY PRODUCTION AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE USING HYDROGEN AS AN ENERGY SOURCE FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES TRAINS AND OTHER AND USES. AND FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM A GROUP THAT IS THINKING CRITICALLY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND USE. AND I'M VERY HONORED THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES IT IS OF COURSE OUR SISTER COMMITTEE THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THAT'S TASKED WITH CLEAN ENERGY AND AIR QUALITY IN ALL THINGS ENVIRONMENTAL. AND THEY ARE HERE WITH US TODAY A COLD HOLDING THIS HEARING AND SO I WOULD LIKE NOW TO TURN THIS OVER TO MY- CO CHAIR THREE OF US. THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU TO MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE- INTO HYDROGEN POLICY. BEFORE WE GET FURTHER INTO THE POLICY AND BUDGET SEASON THIS YEAR. HYDROGEN IS PROMISING. OF PARTICULARLY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR DIESEL AND IN HARD TO ELECTRIFY APPLICATIONS BUT HOW HYDROGEN IS PRODUCED IN USE MAKES A SIGNIFICANT. DIFFERENCE AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND EMISSIONS BENEFITS RELATIVE TO FOSSIL FUELS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS. I'M EAGER TO LEARN MORE TODAY FOR MORE WITNESSES ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF VARIOUS FORMS OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. AS WELL AS POTENTIAL AND USES. TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE INVEST IN HYDROGEN. WHETHER THROUGH POLICY OR BUDGET IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAKING PRACTICAL INVESTMENTS FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT. AS WELL AS THAT THE INVESTMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TERM CLIMATE ENERGY AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE ON FOR ORGANIZING THIS I'M VERY EXCITED I'M TO JOIN YOU TODAY. THANK YOU AND NOW I'D LIKE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY REMARKS I'D LIKE TO MAKE BEFORE WE MOVED TO OUR PANELS. OR ANY MEMBER WHO IS SITTING WITH THE COMMITTEE. OKAY THANK YOU AND WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ALEX LEE AND STEVE BENNETT THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. SO WHAT I WAS KALRA HI JOSH- SO OUR FIRST PANEL IS ON STATE GOVERNMENT IN HYDROGEN POLICY AND I'D LIKE TO IN WELCOME OUR FIRST SPEAKER SURE DAVID HAAS CHILD OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND WE CAN SEE. HI THANK YOU CHAIR FRIEDMAN AT YOUR RIVAS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING- CHILDREN OFTEN I JOIN YOU TODAY- MY ADVISER CAN RIDERS ON AS WELL. YEAH DOING MY SLIDE SO LET ME JUST START WITH THE QUESTION WHAT IS HIGH IT IS A- ODORLESS COLORLESS TASTELESS- NONTOXIC HIGHLY COMBUSTIBLE GAS IT DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE I'M JUST TO SET THE TABLE A LITTLE BIT FOR. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HYDROGEN THAT WE SEE IN THE MARKET TODAY THERE'S GREAT HYDROGEN WHICH IS REALLY HUNDREDS OF PRODUCED FROM FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS WITHOUT CARBON CAPTURE THAT'S AT THE POINT OF PRODUCTION. HI NOT TODAY GLOBALLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 95% OF HYDROGEN IN PRODUCTION TODAY. THEN THERE'S BLUE HYDROGEN WHICH IS HYDROGEN THAT'S PRODUCED FROM FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS. WITH CARBON CAPTURE THE BOARD PRODUCTION. BOB AND- THAT CAN SOME- IT'S NOT ALL OF THE OF THE- NATION'S AND THEN FINALLY- THERE'S GREEN HYDROGEN. WHICH ENCOMPASSES A BUNCH OF CARBON NEUTRAL PRODUCTION PATHWAYS INCLUDING ELECTRICAL ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN WHICH IS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS POWER TO GAS WHICH IS THE CONVERSION OF ELECTRICAL POWER. INTO GASHES ENERGY- OUR AND- THERE'S OTHER DONE. AS WELL SO THOSE ARE ROUGHLY THE THREE TYPES THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT COLORS YOU KNOW ABOUT BLACK HUNDRED WHICH IS AT THE CORE PINK IDEAS AND FOR NUCLEAR BUT THESE ARE THE THREE BIG ONES- AND SO THE COST POSITION YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT OF THE SLIDE. OUR GREAT HAD HIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER TODAY- RIGHT ABOUT TWO DOLLARS A KILOGRAM- BLUE HYDROGEN- BUT TO TWENTY SEVEN AND THEN ROUGHLY FIVE TO NINE DOLLARS FOR GREEN HYDROGEN ALTHOUGH- WITH SKILL THOSE NUMBERS CAN CAN COME DOWN- BECAUSE NEXT WHAT. SO IN TERMS OF USE FOR HYBRID I THINK THIS IS REALLY. THE CENTRAL QUESTION BEFORE US I THINK IT'S CLEAR HYDROGEN. DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHAT ARE THE SWIM LANES AND I SHOULD JUST PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THAT. WE ARE ABOUT TO DO A CONTRACT TO FIND A HYDROGEN ROADMAP WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS- DOES THAT WORK- FROM A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE IS ONGOING BUT ROUGHLY THE THREE CATEGORIES. THAT WE SEE HAD GOING- LONG TERM OR TO HELP SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC GRID- TO DO THE HARD TO TRANSPORTATION THAT ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY. AND THEN SOME HARD TO ELECTRIFY INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS- JUST ON THE ELECTRIFICATION PIZZA TRANSPORTATION SINCE THAT'S GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION. I DO WANT TO COME A LEVEL SET THERE- WE- HAVE BEEN PUTTING IN A LOT OF INVESTMENT INTO THE SPACE. AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT I THINK HEAVY DUTY IS REALLY. OF THE MUCH BETTER NEED SH SO- BLOOMBERG NEW ENERGY FINANCE TRACKS. NEW VEHICLE MODEL INTRODUCTIONS- THERE ARE PUBLIC. AND TODAY BY. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THEY ARE PROJECTING FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MODELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE COMING TO MARKET OTHER ANNOUNCED AND- THREE MODELS HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES OF THE PASSENGERS PICKS LIKE TO TRACK SO. ON THE ON THE- TRANSPORTATION SIDE WE REALLY SEE A LOT OF MOMENTUM FOR ELECTRIC ON PASSENGER BUT- HEAVY DUTY WHERE THERE'S LONG HAUL ROUTES I THINK IS IT IS IMPORTANT EACH AND- SO A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE ARE TO SUPPORT THAT. WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HYDROGEN. REFUELLING STATIONS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT TO GET TWO HUNDRED BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. OUR STATE GOAL. OF TWO HUNDRED BY THE END OF. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- NEXT MONTH. SO SOME OF THE LIMIT OF THAT URGES NEED TO WORK THROUGH THE COST IS- CURRENTLY GREEN. IS MORE. THAN GRAD TO PER- AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING CAN COME DOWN WITH SKILLED WITH FURTHER INNOVATION BUT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY- THE PIPELINE CAPACITY LIMITS THAT EXIST. ARE ALSO ARE A CONCERN- SO WE COULD GET UP TO TWENTY PERCENT. THIS IS 20% BLAND- IN THE EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE- BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T FULLY DECARBONISE THE PIPELINE YOU CAN'T GO FURTHER THAN THAT- BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS WITH THE GAS THAT'S SUCH A SMALL MOLECULE- DEFICIENCY IS- IS NOT IS. AS GOOD A DIFFERENT CERTAINLY FOR LIKE TO GET CALLS ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH ELECTRICITY PER MILES ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLE- AND THEN THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE HE PUMPED WATER HEATING. ARE IT'S ABOUT FOUR TIMES WORTH MISSIONS TO ELECTROCUTE PUMPED AND HYDROGEN- THOSE APPLICATIONS- AND THEN THERE'S STILL YOUR POLLUTION FROM COMBUSTION SO. HIS ARE ALL ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH AND I THINK REALLY THE MAIN QUESTION HERE'S AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIMAL SOME LANES. FOR HYDROGEN AS WE GO FORWARD TO- OUR. CLIMATE GOALS OUR NEXT LINE. SO HOW DO CHEN VESTMENTS THAT WE MAY- AT THE ENERGY. TODAY ALSO IT'S OVER QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS- AND JUST FOR CONTEXT. THAT IS MORE. THAN IT EVERY SINGLE NATION IN THE WORLD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JAPAN ON ABSOLUTE BASIS. AND IT'S NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD ON A PER CAPITA BASIS MOST OF THAT INVESTMENT HAS GONE TOWARDS. THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE- FOR A REFUELING STATIONS THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS THROUGH OUR EPIC PROGRAMS. AND OTHER DEMONSTRATION- YOU KNOW INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AND SO FORTH AND THEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT'S PROPOSED FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE YEARS A HUNDRED MILLION. UP FOR THAT THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON NON FOSSEL HYDROGEN. HOW TO EXPAND THE MARKET FOR THAT AND- WE HOPE THAT INVESTMENT WILL HELP DRIVE DOWN SO THE COST WE'RE TALKING UP. AND IT IS IN A WE'RE DOING- THE STUDENTS TO BILLION ALTOGETHER FOR. OUR RECHARGING REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE BUDGET AND SO WE EXPECT SOME OF THAT WILL GO TOWARD SOME OUTSIDE REGION IN OUR- I TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM BUDGET EXCELLENT. SO JUST TO LEVEL SET AGAIN ON THE STATIONS- WE'RE AT FIFTY FIVE TODAY HUNDRED BY ANY NEXT YEAR TWO HUNDRED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS THE STATE COAL- THAT'S ANOTHER TO SUPPORT I BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND VEHICLES- YOU KNOW NOT INTENDED THAT SCENARIO- ART SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE KEEPING TO THE DIRECTIVE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT IS A CIRCLE- IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE HONEST BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF. STATUS BUT DID FOR YOU AND ROUGHLY THE COST PER STATION IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS- HYDROGEN. ARE REFUELING STATION CALIFORNIA. EXCELLENT I THINK I THINK THAT WAS IT SO I'M HAPPY TO OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS OR OR HEAR FROM SURE RIGHT OFF WE CAN TAKE pWE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE SECOND SPEAKER AND THEN DO QUESTIONS- TO THE TWO OF YOU I BELIEVE. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE OUR SECOND SPEAKERS WILL BE CRAIG SIEGEL FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THAT'S RIGHT CHAIRS AND- CHAIR AND OFF WAS UNAVOIDABLY DETAINED AT THE LAST MINUTE AND SENDS HER REGRETS IN REGARDS SO YOU'LL HALF AND FRAYED TO SETTLE THE POOR SUBSTITUTE IN ME. I'M CRAIG SEGAL AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD WAY FOCUS ON MOBILE SOURCES INCENTIVES AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE WITH YOU TODAY. ALTHOUGH MANY APPLICATIONS FOR HYDROGEN INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS I'LL BE FOCUSING MY DISCUSSION TO IT AS A TRANSPORTATION FUEL NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT- INCENTIVES FOR THE USE OF GREENER HYDROGEN AS A VEHICLE FUEL. THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IS CALIFORNIA'S MAIN PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE THE INVESTMENT IN USE OF LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN THE STATE. IS SIMILAR TO THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL TARGET IS SET WHEN WHICH WE DON'T DICTATE THE EXACT TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE MARKET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELIVER LOW CARBON FUELS EFFICIENTLY AND IT'S BEEN WORKING WELL. INTENSITY CARRY BECOMES MORE STRINGENT EACH YEAR WITH A TARGET OF 20% REDUCTION IN THE CARBON INTENSITY IN OUR TRANSPORTATION FUELS THE TWENTY THIRTY RELATIVE TO TWENTY TEN. SO THE PROGRAM DOESN'T DICTATE TECHNOLOGIES IT DOES PROVIDE A CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN SIGNAL FOR THOSE TECHNOLOGIES TO BECOME CLEANER. MORE ABOUT HOW WE DERIVE CARBON INTENSITIES FOR FUELS IN THE PROGRAM TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE FIELD WITH CARBON INTENSITIES BELOW THE STANDARD GENERATED CREDITS. FOR FUELS WITH CARBON INTENSITIES ABOVE THE STANDARD GENERATE DEFICITS. FUEL PRODUCERS WITH DEFICITS MUST THEN PURCHASE CREDITS FROM PRODUCERS OF LOWER CARBON INTENSITY FUELS TO MEET THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS. ARCAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL DISPLACING MORE THAN TWENTY BILLION WITH A B. GALLONS OF PETROLEUM FUEL. SINCE IT WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE BEGAN IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE'VE SEEN THE CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL POOL INVOLVED. ONE WITH PREDOMINATELY EHANOL IS THE ONLY LOW CARBON FUEL OPTION TWO AND THAT INCLUDES RENEWABLE DIESEL ELECTRICITY AND OTHER FUELS. LOW CARBON FUEL VOLUMES MORE THAN DOUBLED AND THEY'VE BEEN MANY RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEW FUEL PRODUCTION PATHWAYS AND CONVERSION OF FOSSIL BASED FACILITIES. TRAINABLE PRODUCTION FACILITIES INCLUDING THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING REFINERIES TO THE PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE JET FUEL. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE HAPPENING WITHOUT THE L. CFS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALONE CREDIT IS CHANGING THE MARKET WERE VALUED AT OVER FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IS THE FUEL PRODUCERS THAT MEANS THIS AND SENT IS FINE ENTIRE BY PRIVATE INVESTMENT NOT TAXPAYER MONEY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE CYCLE ANALYSIS IN ABOUT THE CARBON INTENSITY SCORES THEY MENTIONED THE FUELS THAT ACCOUNT FOR BOTH THE DIRECT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUEL. AS WELL AS INDIRECT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH. VARIOUS CROP BASED BIOFUELS. ALL TRANSPORTATION FUELS VERY AND HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED IN A COME FROM SOURCES THAT VARY FROM SUGAR CANE THE SOLAR PANELS TO JERRY MINORE. WE GENERALLY DESCRIBE CARBON INTENSITY SCORES AS WELL TO WHEEL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE USE THEM TO CALCULATE CREDITS FOR DEFICITS FOR TRANSPORTATION FUELS USED IN CALIFORNIA. WELL WE'LL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONSISTENT FIRST WELL THE TANK EMISSIONS SO THINK OF FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION INCLUDING INDIRECT LAND USE CHANGES IN TRANSPORT PROCESSES WE SOMETIMES CALL THESE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS. FUEL PRODUCTION TRANSPORT CALIFORNIA AND SECOND THING TO WILL EMISSIONS THAT THESE EMISSIONS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE USE IF YOU WANT VEHICLES CORPORATE INTEL COMMISSIONS AND EFFICIENCY DIFFERENCES AND DIFFERENT VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES AS THE COMBUSTIBLES. NOW FOR. FUELS SUCH AS GASOLINE THERE'S A LOOK AT THE EMISSIONS FROM PETROLEUM EXTRACTION OIL WELL. TRANSPORTATION TO A REFINERY. REFINERY EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION OF FINISHED GASOLINE TO FUEL STATION AND COMBUSTION EMISSIONS AND GASOLINE IN A VEHICLE. FOR HYDROGEN THIS CAN LOOK LIKE THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH USING GREAT ELECTRICITY TO CREATE HYDROGEN VIA ELECTROLYSIS FOR INSTANCE. AND THE TRANSPORTATION OF THAT HYDROGEN TO A FUELING STATION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TO THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES PROVIDED BY THE L. CFS PARTICIPATION OF HYDROGEN IN THE PROGRAM HAS INCREASED HUGELY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED GASOLINE GALLON EQUIVALENTS OF HYDROGEN WAS REPORTEDLY ELSIE FEST PROGRAM. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY REPORT VOLUME INCREASED ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION. GASOLINE GALLON EQUIVALENTS ANTENA THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO TIMES INCREASE. IN RECENT YEARS THE VALUE OF HYDROGEN SUPPLIED IN CALIFORNIA HAS GRADUALLY SHIFTED TOWARD LOWER CARBON INTENSITY AND RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. CARBON INTENSITY OF HYDROGEN VARIES BY PRODUCTION METHOD AND FEEDSTOCK IN PARTICULAR HAD A GENDER RIGHTS RENEWABLE SOURCES SUCH AS IT GERRY BIO GAS AND ZERO CARBON INTENSE ELECTRICITY. BETTER THAN HYDROGEN DERIVED FROM FOSSIL SOURCES. THE CARBON INTENSITIES AND HAVE RANGE THUS FAR FROM NEGATIVE TWENTY FIFTY FIVE GRAMS FOR MAKING TOOL FOR DAIRY BIOGAS DR TENER CHEN. TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR GRAMS TO MAKE A JEWEL FOR HYDROGEN DERIVED FROM ELECTROLYSIS USING ELECTRICITY. IS THE STAND WE COMES MORE STRINGENT HIGHER CARBON INTENSITY HYDROGEN WILL GENERATE FEWER CREDITS INCENTIVIZING THEIR INTRODUCTION OF LOWER CARBON INTENSITY SOURCES OF HYDROGEN OVERTIME. NOW WE'VE GOT OVER HOW INCENTIVIZE GREENER HEADER CHEN THE TRANSPORTATION FUEL LET'S TURN TO HOW IT INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF THAT HAVE REGION. IN HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES NEXT SLIDE. CAR HAS AN EXTENSIVE PORTFOLIO OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY ENHANCE COMMUNITY PROTECTION AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS TO MEET THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS FOCUSING NEAR TERM. REDUCTIONS IN FULLY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. OTHERS FOCUS ON LONGER TERM GOALS HELPING COMMERCIALIZE AND APPLIES INTERMISSION VEHICLES ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS OF EQUITY FOCUS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE. ENERGY VEHICLES ELIGIBLE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS BUT IF IT PASSED IN TECHNOLOGY ADVANCING PROGRAMS GIVEN THAT MOST HYDROGEN FUELS THAT. HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY IS IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF COMMERCIALIZATION. THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND THE W. MITIGATION TRUST WHICH OUTLINED IN BLUE ON THE SLIDE. PATTERSO VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THROUGH THE COMMERCIAL ARC IT WILL HAVE A PLACE IN OFFER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LET ME BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HEDGING FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU PROGRAMS I MENTIONED. SHE ALSO VEHICLES ARE ELIGIBLE IN ALL OF OUR CONSUMER AND FLEET INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TODAY. THIS INCLUDES ON THAT STEVE EUROPEAN EACH VIP PROGRAMS FOR LIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AS WELL AS OUR EQUITY FOCUS CONCURRENCE FOR ALL ROGRAM AND FINANCING ASSISTANCE PROJECTS. TO FUEL CELL VEHICLES OF HIGHER INITIAL COST TODAY. I PROGRAMS OFFER HIGHER INCENTIVE AMOUNTS FOR FUEL CELL VEHICLES COMPARED TO BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO HELP SUPPORT EARLY MARKET INTRODUCTION. BALANCE OF THE COST DIFFERENTIAL. AS WITH MANY DIFFERENT. DEMAND FOR FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS IS STILL RELATIVELY LOW. DUE TO LIMITED VEHICLE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY FOR EXAMPLE THAT 5% OF THE CVR P. LIKE ANY VEHICLE FUNDING. HAS SUPPORTED FUEL CELL VEHICLES TODAY AND THAT IS DUE ALMOST ENTIRELY TO CONSUMER CHOICE WHICH OF COURSE MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. WE'VE ALSO FUNDED FUEL CELL TRANSIT BUSES AND HYDROGEN FUELING TO VOLKSWAGEN MITIGATION TRUST. ME WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE. OUR PRE COMMERCIAL DEMONSTRATION PILOT FNDING IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE AND SPORTING FUEL CELL VEHICLE TO POINT DEVELOPMENT TO DEPLOYMENT. I'VE BEEN THIS TECHNOLOGIES COME TO MARKET SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN COVERS FUNDED A TOTAL OF OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEMONSTRATION PILOT PROJECTS WITH HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES RECEIVING ABOUT A THIRD OF THIS FUNDING. THIS PROJECT TO HELP ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY SO CAN PLAY BIGGER ROLE IN A COMMERCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE NEAR FUTURE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ZERO EMISSION TRUCK AND BUS MARKET HAS EXPANDED RAPIDLY OVER THE PAST YEARS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED MILES BEING AVAILABLE TODAY. OUR MISSION TRUCKS AVAILABLE IN EVERY WEIGHT CLASS ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF LOCATIONS. TODAY IS HERE BECAUSE I MAINLY BEING OFFERED BY SMALLER STARTUP MANUFACTURES NEARLY EVERY MAJOR MANUFACTURER HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LAUNCH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. IN TERMS OF OUR INCENTIVES THEY CURRENTLYHUNDRED FORTY THREE ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS AND BUS MODELS ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE IN THE HEAVY DUTY H. V. I. P. PROGRAM. FOUR OF THOSE A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE HAVE FUNDED DEMONSTRATIONS AND PILOTS INCLUDING HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES SINCE THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SPENT ON THREE FUEL CELL BUS PILOTS TO DEPLOY TWENTY FIVE TRANSIT BUSES THE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE TRAINING. THIS PROJECT HELPS NEW FLYER COMMERCIALLY LAUNCHED A FUEL CELL BUSES WHICH ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR H. B. A. P. AND PW INCENTIVES. THE PROJECTS ARE ALSO PROVIDING OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES OF VALUABLE INFORMATION IS THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION. WE'VE INVESTED SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FIVE FUEL CELL TRUCK DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN JUST LAUNCH A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR FUEL CELL TRUCK PILOT IN COLLABORATION WITH CC. ELEVEN THIRTY HYUNDAI CLASS EIGHT DRAYAGE TRUCKS. AND WE SUPPORTED HAD ORIGINALLY OFFERED SECTORS WHILE ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CARGO HANDLING AND BRING OUT THE CATIONS. AS YOU SEEN FIRST HAND WITH A DEMONSTRATION INVESTMENTS IN BATTERY ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THESE EARLY INVESTMENTS PROVIDE A PATH TO COMMERCIALIZATION FOR MORE HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. FINALLY BEGIN EARLY MARKETS ACCESS FOR HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES IS INFRASTRUCTURE. MANY AND NEED IF CAUGHT THAT HEAVY DUTY HATTERS AND STATIONS WILL BE INSTALLED AND OPERATING VEHICLES EQUIPMENT ARE DELIVERED. HER CONTINUES TO WORK WITH ENGINE COMMISSION AND OTHER PARTNERS TO COORDINATE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING TO SUPPORT ON GOING GROWTH AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL MARKET AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW FINALLY BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS HYDROGEN ALLOWED WITH THE THOUGHT. OF THE CONCEPT OF HYDROGEN FUELED CARS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME. THE FIRST PRODUCTION MODEL DIDN'T HAPPEN UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WEARING ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO SEE THEM BEING SOLD COMMERCIALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS IS RAMPED UP STATE TIME AND THEN ACCELERATE. FURTHER OTHER MUCH IS BEING DISCUSSED OVER VARIOUS COLORS OF HYDROGEN. BROWN BLUEGREEN ETCETERA THERE'S A HER A STICKS AND ULTIMATELY WE CAN'T HOLD ONE TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT AIR POLLUTION CLIMATE CHANGE A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHERS. ANYTHING THAT IS CLEANER THAN FOSSIL FUELS HELPS WHICH IS ONE REASON THESE CARBON INTENSITY METRICS HELP US SEE CLEARLY. I BILLS THAT YOU DIFFICULT AND TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. WE MUST BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE OVER TIME AS A PROGRAMS HELP THEM DO. A PATIENT THAT PERTINI TO PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- I THINK I WILL. SEE IF ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS BEFORE I ASK MY OWN. MISTER BENNETT SURE GO AHEAD. OKAY WILL DO BENNETT AND THEN WILL DO MISTER MCCARTY IN THE MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SHARE. FRIEDMAN OF THEY JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT SO THAT MY QUESTIONS ARE NOT MISSED MISCONSTRUED BUT I CLEARLY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GO GREEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE GET TO A 100% GREEN HYDROGEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- SECOND- I THINK pIT'S REALLY HEALTHY IF WE MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP AS MANY AS AS- THE CAR BUT A SPOKESPERSON THERE JUST TO JUST MENTION THAT WE KEEP AS MANY TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE I HARK BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE COMPANIES- PURCHASED UP THE PATENTS FOR ALL OF THE ELECTRIC CARS. AND DESTROYED DOES HOW MUCH DIFFERENT THE WORLD WOULD BE TODAY- FOR THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS WE WOULD HAVE HAD ELECTRIC CAR TECHNOLOGY COMPETING WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY AND ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE- SO. WHEN I ASK THESE QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT QUESTIONS THAT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS TOWARDS ELECTRICITY AND BATTERY POWERED CARS WE NEED BOTH- NOT JUST CARS BUT IT'S IN THE HOLE TRANSPORTATION- SECTOR- BUT MY QUESTION- FOR- I THINK BOTH PROBABLY SEE YOU SEE. MORE APPROPRIATELY- THERE'S A REFERENCE TO THE ELECTRICITY BEING MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH NEEDED THREE THOUSAND KILOWATT HOURS- FOR- TEN THOUSAND MILES IN A BATTERY CAR- SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT HOURS FOR TEN THOUSAND MILES AND A- FUEL CELL VEHICLE- I ASSUME THAT- THAT THAT DATA. FROM. SIX STANDARD IS IT THE BEST ELECTROLYSIS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE TODAY IS THAT CORRECT HAVE SOMEONE YEAH FOR THE QUESTION ACTUALLY MY ADVISER CAN RIDER DID THAT. CALCULATION CAN ARE YOU ARE YOU ON. YES HELLO SOME YEAH THAT THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THE WORLD WE- THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT PATHWAYS ACTUALLY THEY THE COMPRESSOR METHODOLOGY IN TRANSPORTATION AND OTHERS LARGER DIVERGENCE ANYTHING EFFICIENTLY WHERE IF YOU SOME OF THE QUALIFIED PERSONS COMPRESSED WE USED TO AND- FAVORABLY FOR THE- HYDROGEN DISTRIBUTION THERE- BUT THERE THAT BUILDERS EASY CALCULATION BUT THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES THAT- CORROBORATE- THAT. RELATIVE EFFICIENCY. USING THE LIQUID OR THE GAS FORM RECEIVING GOT GREAT. BLOCKING YOUR HIGHER OR WITH YOU LIKE WOULD WITH MICHAEL AND MY THE NEXT QUESTION WITH THAT IS THAT- THERE'S A REFERENCE IN THE REPORT- AND THIS COMPARES HYDROGEN AND BATTERY TECH AND FUEL CELL AND BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ON THE ELECTRICITY NEEDED TO PRODUCE TEN THOUSAND MILES- IS THERE A COMPARISON OUT THERE IN TERMS OF TOTAL LIFECYCLE- WITH THE NUMBER OF RARE EARTHS AND- MINERALS pEARTH MINERALS NEEDED FOR BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY AND IS THERE A STUDY OUT THERE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WILL THERE BE IN THE MINING OF RARE EARTH MINERALS I KNOW WE HAVE- WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SOURCE OF LITHIUM BUT THERE ARE OTHER RARE EARTH MINERALS THAT ARE ALSO GOING TO BE REQUIRED- FOR BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. ARE THERE FEWER RARE EARTH MINERALS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED FOR THE HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SO IF YOU'LL SELECTRIC VEHICLES USING ELECTRIC DRIVETRAIN SO MANY OF THEM ARE THE SAME SO FOR EXAMPLE. DO YOU DINAMIC PRESENT ANY- YOU KNOW IN THE BACK THAT'S AND SO FORTH. BUT OTHERS LIKE LITHIUM. NICKEL COBALT. YEAH AND THE BATTERIES- DID YOU SEE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WOULD NOT BE. IN ALL THE I'M HAVING SAID THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BATTERY INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW. IS A MOVEMENT AWAY FROM- SO THERE'S YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO IT SPARKS JUST OPENED A FACTORY IN AND CALIFORNIA'S DOING COBALT FREE LITHIUM ION. AND NICKEL FREE. ACTUALLY SO OVER TIME THE NUMBER OF THOSE YOURS IS GOING TO GO DOWN- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING UNIQUE OBSTRUCTING IS ANY OTHER REPRESENTS ENOUGH FUEL CELL VEHICLE THAT WOULDN'T BE THAT EASY IT IDON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE. BUT I THINK ALL ADAMA IS IN TERMS OF LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS WE SEE DRAMATICALLY LOWER EMISSIONS FROM BOTH KIND OF THE V. BOTH BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELLS THAT YOU TRADITIONAL SUIT GAS OR DIESEL FLOWER POWER TRUCK. AND IN BOTH CASES THANKS TO TOOLS INCLUDING IT CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THE GRAD AND THE CONTINUING LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD SIGNAL ON CARBON INTENSITY THE SKILLS CONTINUE TO GET LAST COVINGTON'S OVERTIME SAYS YOUR MISSION VEHICLE PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. I RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH OF THEM WITH IMPROVEMENTS WILL HAVE FOR LIFE CYCLES I'M JUST CURIOUS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE NOW IF YOU TOOK FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END LIFE CYCLE COST YOU HAVE A- A BIG BATTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF RECYCLING AND- FUEL CELL YOU HAVE A MUCH SMALLER BATTERY. TO ALMOST THAT OF THE BATTERY THE SIZE OF IN A PASSENGER CAR AT THIS POINT TIME- SO RIGHT NOW IN COMPARISON DO YOU HAVE- IS THERE AND NOW THIS IS THIS IS RIGHT NOW TOTAL LIFECYCLE. COST IT DO DO WE HAVE THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS. TO COOK OR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO. YES WE DO AFTER AND THERE'S A USEFUL STUDY- THE INTERNATIONAL- COMMITTEE AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES THAT OFFER. GENERALLY SPEAKING SENIOR DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED- BICYCLE FISHING SEES THAT STUDY WHICH IS FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M EVEN IN THE U. S.'S POWER GRANTED WHICH TENDS TO BE STILL RELATIVELY HIGH CARBON INTENSITY RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ORDER OF ON IT 60% OR MORE. THAT'S TRUE WEALTHY SPEAKING FOR FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY AS WELL I THINK IT'S ALSO IN THAT SERVE SIXTY PERCENT. LEVEL I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDY SHARED BACK OVER TO YOU- THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE SO IF I CAN JUST BE CLEAR LACK LIFE CYCLE OF A OF A FUEL CELL POWERED BY. THIS A HEAVY DUTY TRUCK LIFECYCLE FUEL CELLAR CELL FUEL CELL POWERED HEAVY DUTY TRUCK LIFE CYCLE OF A BATTERY POWERED HEAVY DUTY TRUCK OVERALL LIFECYCLE IMPACT. YOU KNOW I THINK I SEE SIMILAR BENEFITS USING FUEL CELLS AND BATTERIES BUT GET ARE PRETTY HEAVILY ON THE USE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. AND THEN- AND THEN IF I COULD JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION- I NOTED YOUR REPORT THAT THE BIDEN MINISTRATION HAS- ALLOCATED EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO CREATE FOR REGIONAL- CENTERS. OUT THERE- IT TO CREATE GREEN HYDROGEN SO GREEN HIDES A CLEAN HYDROGEN HUBS OF FOUR OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES SO- NOT GREAT AT MATH BUT THAT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS EACH I THINK OF THIS EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS- WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS A LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO HELP MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF THE SITES OF THOSE FOUR REGIONAL HUBS. SO YEAH THANK YOU SO MANY. PEOPLE WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO I WOULD. YEAH WE'RE VERY INTERESTED TO SUPPORT FEDERAL DOLLARS FROM INSTRUCTORS PACKAGE COMPANY CALIFORNIA FOR. EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE EVERYTHING FROM CARBON CAPTURE TWO TWO BATTERIES TO HOW DO YOU THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. HAVE A CONVENING- OF THE LEGISLATURE BRING TOGETHER DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS OR WORKING IN THE SPACE TO TRY TO GET ALIGNMENT. BONTA OVERALL CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL- THAT'S CERTAINLY MY HOPE I BELIEVE THAT. BY THE MONEY WILL GO FARTHER STE- IF IT'S IN CALIFORNIA JUST GIVEN THE- EXPERTISE THIS YEAR IN STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU AB ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR SHARING THIS AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON- THE QUESTIONS YOU MISTER BENNETT. SAID ABOUT ASK ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF THE STATIONS AND THEN JUST COMPARE SING- BIG PICTURE THE FUEL CELL HYDROGEN AND THE ELECTRIC CARS BUT YEAH BIG PICTURE WE ALL REALIZE THAT-IN ORDER TO TACKLE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS ARE GHG REDUCTIONS AND- AIR POLLUTION THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES AT. THAT'S WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT FRANKLY. IS- GLOBAL SOURCES AND SO GETTING- CLEAN CARS. ON THE ROAD IN GETTING POLLUTING CARS OFF THE ROAD IS YOU KNOW NOT ROCKET SCIENCE BUT THE DETAILS ARE WHAT MATTER AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT EASY OR ELSE WE WOULD DONE THIS A LONG TIME AGO AS WAS NOTED. CERTAINLY THE COST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IS HIS CAME OUT CAN WE GO BACK TO THAT SLIDE THE YOU HAD WERE AT AND IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. VERSUS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE FOR IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE NUMBER OF STATIONS. I THINK IT WAS I THINK WAS THE LAST LINE OF MARKET YEAH. YES SIR CAN YOU TELL US FIFTY OR SO IN CALIFORNIA FIFTY FIVE TODAY HUNDRED BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR YES I KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE HERE AND SECRETARY I BELIEVE THAT'S OVER IN WEST SAC RIGHT. AND YOU SEE YOU SEE WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID A COST OF ONE. IT'S ABOUT ONE ONE POINT TWO MILLION IS THE PREPARATION FOR. YEAH THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF IT'S A ONE POINT SOMETHING MILLION PER STATION. AND WE'RE PUTTING IN IN THE BUDGET WHAT IS IT AGAIN OR WAS IT ON THIS. PACKET HERE. HOW MUCH STATE MONEY. WE'RE PUTTING A HUNDRED MILLION. FOR THESE. WELL THE HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR GREEN HYDROGEN RICH AT LARGE THE I SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT MONEY WE'VE SPENT MANY OF THESE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF FIFTY FIVE REPRESENT THE ONES THAT ARE COMPLETED BILLABLE RIGHT NOW FOR USERS BUT THERE'S A BUNCH MORE I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION IS TO GET TO FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED HOW MUCH ARE WE ASSUMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NEEDS TO PUT UP FRONT FOR THE ONE MILLION PER STATION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE STATION'S GOING TO GET SOME MONEY FROM THEIR CONSUMERS MAY BE SIGNED OFF TO MAKE IT PENCIL OUT WHICH IS WHY WE NEED THE SUBSIDY FOR A LOT OF THINGS WE DO SO HOW MUCH OF IT DO WE NEED TO PUT IN THEIR PER STATION TO MAKE THESE. FINANCIALLY PENCIL OUT. YEAH SO I THINK- AND- CANTOR CREEK PLEASE CLICK THE FIVE MINUTES REMEMBER THIS BUT I BELIEVE THAT HUNDRED FUEL CELL STATIONS IS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER 40% OF THE TOTAL COST. AND ON THE TV STATIONS IT'S ABOUT 30% SO JUST FOR COMPARISON LEVEL TWO CHARGING WOULD TYPICALLY BE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND WE WOULD GIVE US FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR GRANT FOR THAT- YEAH THAT'S YOU KNOW. THIS IS A KIND OF TROUBLES IN OUR JUST DESSERTS ARE YOU GOING STATIONS ARE MARKETS LIKE A GAS STATION- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S LIKE FOR KIDS- CRAZE THAT'S NOT RIGHT TO YOU. THAT I BELIEVE SO BY DEFERRED CAN IN YOUR KINGDOM YEAH YES- ROUGHLY OVER HALF HIS THROUGH A SOME TYPE OF THE SUBSIDY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND THEN EVENTUALLY WHEN THESE ARE GONNA. AVAILABLE AND UTILIZED BY THE PUBLIC ON A LARGER SCALE IT'S LIKE A GAS STATION TODAY WERE PEOPLE OPEN UP IN THE GET MINOR PEOPLE PAY THEIR BILL- AND JUST YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD JUST ENLIGHTEN US IN A IN A IN A- LAY PERSON. WHY DO YOU THINK IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AGAIN I THINK WE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL SO WHETHER THEIR BATTERY PLUGIN BY ELECTRICITY OR- HYDROGEN. FUEL SELLERS YOU KNOW MAYBE POTENTIALLY THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW ZERO EMISSION FUEL THAT'S CREATED I DON'T KNOW THAT'S NOT THERE TODAY BUT- WHAT. WHY DO WE THINK THAT THAT- THE HYDROGEN HAS LAGGED BEHIND AS FAR AS BEING PICKED UP FROM. THE CONSUMERS AND THE MARKETPLACE VERSUS. BATTERY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST OPEN BY SAYING OUR FIDELITY ULTIMATELY IS TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS SO WE'RE NOT COMING IN WITH ANY PREFERENCE OTHER THAN THE MOST PRAGMATIC WAY TO REDUCE POLLUTION- AND YOU KNOW WE FUNDED FOR A LONG TIME ACTUALLY IT'S A BIT COLD MEASURE. EVM STRUCTURE FEEL SOME OF IT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THE COST OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IT'S SORT OF SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED IN SOLAR WITH CRYSTALLINE SILICON PANEL OF SOLAR PANELS WE JUST SAW THIS INCREDIBLE COST REDUCTIONS SO TEN YEARS AGO WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A KILOWATT HOUR LITHIUM ION BATTERY TODAY IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY AND THERE'S A REALLY CREDIBLE PATHWAY TO GET DOWN TO TWO SIXTY TO EIGHTY DOLLARS. FOR LITHIUM ION AND SO WHAT'S WHAT HAS REALLY DRIVEN THIS IS THAT THE- YAMS THAT ARE MAKING THE VEHICLES LOOKED AT THAT MASS AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS UBIQUITOUS THERE'S POWER EVERYWHERE IN EVERY HOME- WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IN COMBAT YOU KNOW HOW TO BUILD A NEW. HIGH COLLECTED SALT CHARGEABLE UNITED AS THE RUN IT A SEPARATE PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO THE WE HAVE A SONG THAT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IT'S JUST BEEN OVERWHELMING INVESTMENT IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SO EVERY MAJOR CAR MANUFACTURER IN THE WORLD TODAY IS BUILDING ELECTRIC MODEL AND I THINK YOU SAW THE SUPERBOWL THERE WERE SEVEN ADS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT OCCURRED ONLY TWO BEDS FOR KNOWLEDGE OF VEHICLES FROM MY OF COURSE. EVERYBODY LOOKS AT MARKET CAP AND THE FACT THAT. TESLA BECAME THE MOST THE FIRST COMPANY TO. BURST KHARQAN WORLDS OF TO BE A TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANY- HAS KIND OF RESETTING SO THE MARKET IS REALLY BETTER JAMES. THE OEMS THAT ARE FURTHEST ALONG AN EASY OPTION CURVAS Y. THINK YOU SEE. FORWARD NOW RISING WITH- YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE ELECTRIC F. ONE FIFTY AND SO FORTH THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN. TREND THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE IN THE ART INDUSTRY LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND I THINK ALL IT OFFER IN ADDITION TO CHURCHILL'S GOOD POINTS. ARE IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY HEAR SOMEONE BRING YOUR QUESTION IS GOING FORWARD AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS. I THINK I JUST SAY THAT NONE OF US KNOW. EXACTLY WHAT THE PATH IS FOLKS TAKE TO AN END OF COMBUSTION. NO OTHER IN HEAVY DUTY OR LIGHT DUTY. SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND IS SUCH A GOOD THING THAT CAUGHT THE PLUNGING COST OF BATTERIES ENABLE ALL SORTS OF GREAT. CHANGES. IN THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. RALPH LOW. OF THAT. IN OUR MARKETS. IS GET UP TO ONE HUNDRED. THERE'S VERY LIKELY TO BE ROLLED A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND DIFFERENT USES AND USE CASES IT MAY BE DIFFERENT STORIES AND LIGHT DUTY SECTORS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU SEE IN. THE PROGRAM SO FAR IS THIS NEUTRALITY ESTÁ TECHNOLOGY IN THIS DESIRE TO ENSURE SYSTEMS. ARE BROADLY AVAILABLE AND GIVEN. RESERVES ARE MOVING FROM A NICHE TECHNOLOGY. TO THE ANSWER FOR EVERYBODY ACROSS MANY USES. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THE MARKET DEVELOPS ACROSS MANY OF THESE OPTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU THINK YOUR CHAIRS FOR HOLDING THIS MEETING- I DO BELIEVE THAT- IT'S REALLY LONG OVERDUE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW HOW HYDROGEN DOES FIT INTO ZERO EMISSION IN THE FUTURES PRICE BUT IT APPLIES TRANSPORTATION AND- IN LOOKING AT. THE ABILITY TO SCALE IT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE. IN THE URGENCY- TO MOVE FORWARD AND EXPAND THE APPLICATIONS NEEDS TO BE BALANCED CERTAINLY WITH THE SOURCING OF IT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT- IN OF THE GREEN HYDROGEN VERSUS GRAY AND BLUE HYDROGEN THINK THAT ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY AT THIS POINT- THE- ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTION. IS IT IS MORE OF A KIND OF- A MORE INTENSIVE PROCESS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT MOVING TOO QUICKLY JUST TO EXPAND USAGE OF HYDROGEN. BY CONTINUING TO GOING DOWN THE ROUTE OF USING FOSSIL FUELS TO CREATE THE HYDROGEN I KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO SCALE UP OF THAT AND THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST IN THE CONVERSATION AS PART OF THE PLAN OF HOW TO GET- A LARGER WELL. A LARGER VOLUME OF USAGE- BUT I DO I LIKE IT AS IT WAS DISCUSSED AND IN THE REPORT- FOCUSING ON WHAT USES ARE MOST OF THEM MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR HYDROGEN AND IT IS SEEMS AND I AGREE COMPLETELY ON KIND OF THE DIESEL. ON A SHORT HAUL THE PORTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE NUMBER IT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND IS DOING. THAT IF WE KNOW THAT THAT'S GOOD THAT IS. THE BEST THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF USING OUR HYDROGEN AND WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE'RE USING. REALLY GREEN HYDROGEN- THAT THAT. SHOULD BE UP AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. OR MUCH OF OUR RESOURCES SHOULD GO TOWARDS I THINK THAT- GO PUTTING RESOURCES INTO THE GRADING OF THE TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE'LL FURTHER. MOVE US AWAY FROM LONG-TERM GOALS- IN TERMS OF- ZERO MISSION GOALS FOR OUR STATE AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I KNOW THE- TECHNOLOGY CHANGES. USUALLY WHEN TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEWER THEY'RE NOT AS EFFICIENT AS THEY ARE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE SO. I'M HOPEFUL THAT WITH HYDROGEN IT'LL BE JUST THE SAME AS WE SAW WITH SOLAR AND- IN OVERSEEING THE CLUTCH OF VEHICLES ON HAVE YOU. AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE ENERGY TO FUEL- IN A POLITE VEHICLE THAT YOUR VEHICLE IS MUCH DIFFERENT. THE ABILITY TO FUEL I'M- HYDROGEN VEHICLES BUT I'M HOPING THAT WITH THE INVESTMENT WITH THE STATE INVESTMENT WE CAN MOVE IN A MORE POSITIVE ACTION SO. I AM. I JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THAT I DO HAVE- SOME. CONCERNS ABOUT RENEWABLE POTENTIALLY RENEWABLE SOURCE. AND SO- BUT I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN IS LONG OVERDUE. AND IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT. A PRETTY REGULARLY AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE AND HOPEFULLY IN A DIRECTION WE CAN GET MORE MORE EFFICIENT IN CREATING. A GREEN TECHNOLOGY KNOWN SAN JOSE WE HAD DIED AND WILL DIE JESTERS WHAT HAVE YOU WHICH A- MIXED RESULTS. IN TERMS OF THE- THE BUILDING TO CREATE- HYDROGEN BUT AGAIN EVEN THAT TECHNOLOGY IS DRASTICALLY IMPROVING WE SEE GREAT ADVANCES. IN GERMANY AND OTHER PLACES WITH THAT AND SO I LOOK FORWARD. TO I'M KIND OF CONTINUAL. CHECK INS REPORT BACKS ON HOW WE CAN IT REALLY ADVANCE. THE DISSEMINATION OF THE OF GREEN HYDROGEN. AS OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUMMER FONG. I THANK YOU CHAIR STAFF WERE- FOR HAVING THIS I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE THIS QUESTION IS- FIRST YOU- AT THE CDC- IN TERMS OF. WHAT PROJECTS ARE IN THE WORKS WHEN IT COMES TO YOU- SCALING UP HYDROGEN PRODUCTION WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S BEING PLANNED AND WHAT WHAT ARE THE METRICS MOVING FORWARD. MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE CARP TO AND I GUESS THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE THAT QUESTION TO BOTH. THANK YOU SENTIMENTS SO. THE NUMBER OF- MEASURES. WE'RE DOING THROUGH THE- EPIC. PROGRAM YOU KNOW IT IN TERMS OF ITS APPLICATIONS AND SO FORTH. I'M NOT I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE- THE TOP OF. ITEM ON THE LIST OF. HYDROGEN PRODUCTION- PROJECTS I DON'T I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE- STE. YEAH ALL RIGHT OFFER IN ADDITION TO MEMBERS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN THIS SPACE. WHICH WE'RE HAPPY BEING YET SHARE FURTHER BUT IN ESSENCE WE'VE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT SORTS OF WAYS AND TO TEST OUT THE USE OF FUEL CELL VEHICLES- THROUGHOUT THIS INCLUDES FUNDING- IN BUSES TRUCKS REYES SHUCKS IMPORTS AND LYFT. AND WE'VE SEEN YOUR DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS THE CONTESTANTS AND HEAVY DUTY USES ESPECIALLY I'M REDUCING POLLUTION AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO A LOT OF THE GOALS OF THESE PROGRAMS ON THAT YOU'VE HEARD ON THE FUEL SIDE IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. THE GOAL IS TO SEND THIS VERY CLEAR YOU'RE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE MESSAGED HELP ENSURING THE CARBON INTENSITY KEEPS FALLING. BY THE TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION SIDE AND THERE IS AN EFFORT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WORKS IN VARIOUS DEMOS IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS WHICH ARE SHOWING US THAT IS REALLY STRONG AND YOU'LL HEAR AND I THINK WHEN POTENTIAL AND HIGHLIGHT. IT'S REALLY STRONG POTENTIAL IN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE IMPORT USES HIS GIVEN THAT SO MANY OF THE STRANGELY AT SIX BUT WAS COMMUNITIES TO SO MUCH CUSHION SO IT'S EXCITING TO SEE LET'S BEGIN WITH A COCKER. CERTAINLY I CERTAINLY- WHEN IT COMES TO RENEWABLES I'M I'M SURELY TECH AGNOSTIC I GUESS THE QUESTION MAYBE S WITH IN A DIFFERENT WAY- SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- IN THE IN THE IN HIS BUT BUDGET PROPOSAL- WHAT WOULD THAT MONEY BE SPENT ON. AND WHAT PROJECTS WOULD BE FUNDED. SO THE ARE GENERALLY CAN. FOR PROJECTS S I CAN'T SAY SIX SIX WHAT. IN A- BUT I WOULD SET THE UP CHEN SPEAKING. IS THERE IS A EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE CRITERIA. FOR PROJECTS SO AND HE'S VERY BY PROGRAM I KNOW I LOOTED FOR INSTANCE TO THE H. V. I. P. PROGRAM WHICH ARE VOUCHERS- IN THAT CASE YOU'RE JST COMING TO LEICESTER FUNDS TO YOU KNOW. PURCHASE A VEHICLE- IN OTHER CASES ESPECIALLY IN CASES OF PILOT PROJECTS WHAT WE TRY TO DO. IS DEVELOP CRITERIA FOR WHAT WE WANT TO SEE DEMONSTRATED WHETHER FOR INSTANCE SAY IT'S A BETTER APPROACH DEAD REYES TRUCK REFUELING. OR HELPING TRANSIT AGENCIES MOVE FORWARD AND WE ASK FOR COMPETITIVE BIDS SO REALLY TRY TO CREATE. AN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PUBLIC AND THROUGH THESE PUBLIC PROCESS THESE. PATHS THROUGH WHICH WE CAN LEARN ARE COMMERCIALIZED ACKNOWLEDGES AND THAT AS TECHNOLOGIES BECOME MORE COMMERCIAL. THE TENDER GRADUATE FROM THIS BEACH HEADS INTO PARTICULAR PROGRAMS WHERE WE CAN ACT YOU KNOW FOLKS EQUITIES SCALE. AND I LASTLY I NOTICED ONE OF THE REAL FOCUSES THROUGHOUT THOSE MORE SCALE PROGRAM. THAT MAKING SURE WE'RE TAKING CARE NOT JUST ABOUT BIG FLEETS BUT A SMALL FLEET SO MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN ACCESS. THIS TECHNOLOGY TO JUST GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF THAT KANEMI. OKAY SO YOU. JUST ADDED THAT SO WE TYPICALLY TRY TO LIKE LEVEL SET OR WHERE PROCESS ISN'T ON THE GRANTS ARE FOCUSED ON. WHAT IS THE MOST PRAGMATIC WAY TO LOWER THE COST OF FOR. EXAMPLE FOR ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT EXACTLY WHAT PROCESSES YOUR BOOK. THE MOST PROMISE AND THEN EVERYTHING YOU WORKSHOPS% EVERYTHING SO WE DON'T TAKE ACTION ON DESIGN PROGRAM UNTIL. WE'VE GOTTEN STAKEHOLDER INPUT- IT'S A GREAT. BUT NOW WE CRAFTED FROM THAT. OKAY SO TERMS OF METRIC- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT A NUMBER OF THE GRANTS THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING M. IS TO ENCOURAGE THE PURCHASE OF A OF A RENEWABLE HYDROGEN VEHICLES SO- ANYWAY AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED A METRIC WHERE YOU WE WENT FROM THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED- GASOLINE EQUIVALENT- PRIVILEGED TO NOW ONE POINT THREE MILLION- SO HOW MANY L. HYDROGEN VEHICLES OR HOW TO IF YOU SELL VEHICLES ARE ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW AND HOW IS THAT GROWING OVER TIME. SAYS GRAHAM CONSIDERABLY IT'S REALLY TAKEN OFF MY DUTY I THINK THAT THERE ABOUT NINETY SIX HUNDRED VEHICLES WE FUNDED THROUGH RECEIVE YOUR P. IN TERMS OF HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THERE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BEHIND THE CURVE. SO I'M AWARE FOR INSTANCE ABOUT THIRTY DRAYAGE TRUCKS WE FUNDED WITHIN TRANSIENT OTHER THIRTY SIX TRUCKS IN TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION LAXER TALKING TENS OF VEHICLES. BUT THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT STARTING POINTS THAT SERVE TRACKS ABOUT THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING EARLIER EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THE COMES TO CONSUMER PURCHASES. YOU'RE TALKING IT OUT. AT TECHNOLOGY A GNOSTIC PROGRAM WHERE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING THE CHOICE. AND HENCE YOU KNOW THESE OVER TEN THOUSAND. I THINK SOME OF MY STAFFERS AND AROUND TWELVE THOUSAND. VEHICLES IN CONSUMER PROGRAMS VERSUS AND BEGINNING TO SEE A FUEL CELL VEHICLE ROLLOUTS AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. IS YOUR AT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT FOR FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE EMPHASIS IS WHICH- I GUESS THAT WAS AS MORE THAN HIS BEEN ON LIGHT DUTY AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S BEEN MORE VERSES HEAVY DUTY OR- HOW DO YOU- I GUESS HOW DO YOU ASSESS AS SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING ON HEAVY DUTY OR SHOULD WE- PRIORITIZE. OUR DO YOU- HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THEM. WELL I THINK THIS IS A TECH DEVELOPMENT CURVE STORY YOU KNOW LIKE THE VEHICLES AND GENERALLY BAN SOMEONE AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN TERMS OF ITS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES GENERALLY AND THAT'S TRUE FOR BOTH BATTERY AND FUEL CELL- AND THAT'S RAPIDLY BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN PART THROUGH. STATE INVESTMENT DOLLARS SO YOU KNOW IT WILL STAY TRUE AND AT LEAST IN A CURRENT STATUS THE LIKE TO THE PROGRAMS THOSE THEIR FUEL NEUTRAL. AT AT HOLDEN AND WE CAN FOLLOW THAT CHOICE WHICH I THINKMAKES SENSE AS WE SEE REGULATORY WRAP UP TO A 100% IMPORT TO STAY FLEXIBLE. AND HEAVY DUTY. THAT TECHNOLOGY IS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING YEAH WE REALLY SIZE BATTERY ELECTRIC HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES START TO TAKE OFF WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE SAME THING THE FUEL CELL. AND WE THINK ABOUT GETTING ALL THE WAY TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION PORTED TO STAY SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE GIVEN THESE DIFFERENT USE CASES ONE THING I WOULD SAY OVERALL THOUGH IN THIS IS I THINK PART OF THE OVERALL BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. A STRONG FOCUS IN HEAVY DUTY IS QUITE IMPORTANT THERE FEWER OVERALL VEHICLES WHICH IS ONE REASON THE NUMBERS WIND UP A BIT LOWER. THEY'RE REALLY PLEADING VEHICLES IN THE TEND TO EXPOSE ON EACH A COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY ACUTELY IT'S ALSO A PLACE WHERE FOR DRIVE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT WE SEE IT SPREAD. INTO LIGHT DUTY IN BACK AND FORTH SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS THE SORT OF PORTFOLIO APPROACH REALLY SPEAKS TO SEVERAL THINGS IT SPEAKS TO RELATIVE VOLUMES OF VEHICLES IN THE MARKET. IT SPEAKS TO WEAR TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE CURRENT. IN SPEAKS TO THE NEED AT LEAST IN MY VIEW- TO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT CAN FIND. OUT AT DIFFERENT POINTS ON THAT CURVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING COMMERCIALISE TECHNOLOGIES SOME THAT ARE FOCUSED. SPECIFICALLY ON EQUITY NEEDS OUR SMALL FLEET NEEDS. AND SOME THAT ARE DRIVING. DEVELOPMENT ONE THING THAT IS REALLY STRIKE ME ABOUT. PROGRAMMING GENERAL. YOU DO SEE THAT SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS SUCH THAT EACH OF THESE CADRES. YOU SEE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FROM INITIAL BEACH HAD ALL THE WAY TO MARKET. AND PART OF WHAT WE HOPE TO DO AND WHICH WE REALLY VALUE- AND- YET. GUIDANCE FROM IN THESE COMMITTEES FROM THE PUBLIC- IS YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT BALANCE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO- BE PRESENT FOR ALL PARTS OF THAT TRANSFORMATION. SO IN TERMS OF- SCALING UP- DO YOU HAVE INTERNAL METRICS WERE WITH ORACLE POLITICAL GOAL POSTS WHERE YOU YOU WANT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AYE CHEN VEHICLES. YOU KNOW EACH YEAR BEING SOLD OR OVER DUBBED BY A WINDOW I MEAN DO YOU GET DOWN TO THAT THAT LEVEL OR- ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO JUST GET MORE PEOPLE TO BUY ARJUN VEHICLES. WHAT WILL WE DO TRACK PRETTY CLOSELY ACTUALLY- IN CONTRACTING WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF FROM THE CALIFORNIA FIRST YOU SYSTEM TO TRACK. YOUR PROGRAM PERFORMANCE ACROSS ALL THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THE METRICS TO TRACK VERY LITTLE BIT BY PROGRAM I MEAN FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON A PILOT PROJECT. YOU MIGHT BE LESS INTERESTED IN TOTAL VOLUME I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE KNOWLEDGE IS PRODUCED AND EXPERIENCE OF THE USERS. WHICH FOR SOME THE OTHER PROGRAMS WERE REALLY INTERESTING UNDERSTANDING NOT JUST VEHICLE VOLUME AND WE'RE INTERESTED AGAIN IN ALL KINDS OF THEIR MISSION VEHICLES IN ITS GETTING OUT OF COMPASSION THAT MATTERS. OF COURSE WE ALSO TRY TO TRACK WHICH SORTS OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE TAKING OFF FROM A USER EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SO THESE YOU KNOW INVOLVES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FROM HOW PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING. REAL ABILITY THE CHARGING NETWORK- TO- YOU KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF THE VEHICLE AND HOW THAT SCALES BETWEEN FOLKS IN DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS CLASSES ECCENTRICITY LET DIFFERENT METRICS THE GOING TO THAT'S AND WE TRY TO KEEP LEARNING I KNOW THAT'S A- BIG PICTURE ANSWER SURE THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT PIECES. NO I'VE I APPRECIATE THAT- ENTER ENTER IN TERMS OF SCALING UP HYDROGEN PRODUCTION HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT LOOK- MOVING FORWARD. FOR THE FUTURE- I. TELL GO I CAN. TO SOME OF THE- MY STAFF JUST AS- PER SO WE- SET. MILLION IN OUR TRANSPORTATION PROBE INTO HUNDRED PRODUCTION FAR THIS TO. PLANTS EXPECTED TO COME ONLINE. BY NEXT YEAR AND THEN THE NOPE IT JUST WENT UP FOR THREE MORE WHICH WILL BE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION PLANTS. OKAY THEN THAT'S SO THAT'S IN THE IN NEXT TWO THREE YEARS YOU YOU EXPECT EXPECT FOR AT FIVE FIVE FIVE PLANNED TO GIVE TO RIGHT NOW AND THREE IN THE WORKS. CORRECT AND THEN JUST TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION DOES NOT KNOWLEDGE THIS GOAL ON. FUEL CELL VEHICLES THE GOVERNOR'S CALL YOU DON'T GET A FIVE MILLION- THESE ARE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SAY COMPASS. ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL BUT AGAIN AS CREEK. POINTED OUT WE HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. ALSO VEHICLES THE IN THE ELECTRIC IS WE'RE AT TODAY. OKAY NO I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A- YOU MADE A LOT OF TIMES I THINK. YOU KNOW WE HEAR THE NOMINAL NUMBERS I GUESS FOR MYSELF I WILL SAY THAT THE GOAL I WAS JUST KIND OF CURIOUS FROM AN AGENCY STANDPOINT WHETHER YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES OF WILL UP A PERCENTAGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD THAT YOU WANT TO BE AYE CHEN THAT YOU WANT TO HELP ELECTRIC THAT YOU WANT TO BE- WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THERE. SO I BRIDGE PUT NOTE. YEAH NO I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THIS IS WHERE THAT AT SOME POINT THE MARKET HAS TO JUST DECIDE OUR FACILITIES TO THE- GOALS THAT WE WERE IT'S- INTERMISSION THOUGH HARD TARGET THAT WE DO HAVE. TO GET CARDS AS THE VEHICLES WE DO THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND A HARD TARGET THAT WE DO HAVE- THE DIRECTION WE'RE CALLING. FOR EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO GET TO TWO HUNDRED. YOU'LL SELL STATIONS. DID KNOWLEDGE. WAS ARE GOING TO GO AS TO HOW. HYDROGEN FUEL TANK PLANTS ARE HOUSING. YOU'LL STILL DIGITAL BY TWENTY FIVE CORRECT AND WE'RE FIFTY FIVE TODAY. YEAH A PART OF I THINK THE SUCCESS WE'VE HAD HONESTY'S BEEN SOME LIKE GNOSTIC AS TO THE TECHNOLOGY TYPE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE I GET A MENTION THIS DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN AND COMMERCIALIZE. WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING FLEET OWNERS MAKE CHOICES- REALLY WANT N CHOOSING BASED UPON THE NEEDS OF THEIR FLEET AND THAT ALSO ENCOURAGES I THINK MANUFACTURERS DEVELOP AND RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES VEHICLE TYPES. SO THE HOPE HERE REALLY IS FOR THE STATE'S INVESTMENT DOLLARS TO DO THE THINGS THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS CAN'T IN TERMS OF BOTH CREATING STRONG REGULATORY SIGNAL AND THEN ON THE INCENTIVE SIDE. I'M PROVIDING FOR THE PRETTY HIGH DEGREE OF UNCONSTRAINED CHOICE OR WE CAN THAT RECOGNIZES THAT PARTICULARLY CREATING PATHS FOR SMALLER OPERATORS SMALLER BUSINESSES AND REDUCE EXPOSURE TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE FRONTLINE- HAS PARTICULAR VALUE TO US- AN- BY LAST QUESTION AND A CURIOSITY YOU MENTIONED- MARKET DYNAMICS WHAT IS. WHAT IS THE MARKET TELLING YOU WHAT IS WHAT ARE CONSUMERS SAYING WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION RIGHT NOW IS IT IS IT INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IT THE REBATE IS IT I MEAN IS IT A COMBINATION OF BOTH IS IT IS WHAT WHAT WHAT. DO YOU SEE RIGHT NOW AND IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. SO THE FIRST SAYS PRETTY GOOD NEWS UNLIKE YOU DECIDE TO PROP HEARD THE MILLIONS OF FLORIDIANS AVERAGE JUST SOLD AND WE'RE UP TO LIKE EIGHTY SEVEN. THAT MODELS AVAILABLE. TO PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS HELPING PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A REALLY DIFFERENT MARKET THAN THEY MAY PERCEIVE IT TO BE FROM THE TIME THE LAST BY THE VEHICLE. AND HELPING THEM RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE GENERALLY. CHEAPER VEHICLES TO ROT SO HUGE DEMAND RIGHT FOR- VEHICLE REBATES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ALMOST SENIOR P. REBATES AND GONE OUT CLEAN CARS FOR ALL IS GOING UP. WE DO SEE A LOT THERE AND SIMILARLY HUGE DEMAND. IN BOTH H. FIFTEEN CORE PROGRAMS FOR THESE VEHICLES AND PEOPLE LOVE THEM YOU KNOW WHEN THE DRIVER. SO THAT'S BAD AT LEAST IS NEVER THE ISSUE THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN THE LAST LONGER ESPECIALLY WITH THESE- CRAZY TIMES THEY'RE A LOT CHEAPER TO FUEL. SO THOSE ARE ALL WINS- PEOPLE OF COURSE I WAS A QUESTIONS ABOUT RANGE WHICH IS ALWAYS GOING OUT THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT FEELING WHICH IS SEIZING THE WANT TO SPEAK TO BUT THAT'S ALSO EVER EXPANDING. REALLY FEEL LIKE WERE RIGHT ON THE CUT CARE. WHERE WE'VE SEEN THIS SORT OF. MAJOR EXPANSION. MOVING THOROUGH. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY FORWARD YOU KNOW A LOT OF HOW WE'VE CALIBRATED THESE PROGRAMS. IS TO CONTINUE SENDING CERTIFICATES STRONG COST SIGNALS TO IMPROVE THE FUELS. ARMIES HAD BEEN TRYING TO. CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT. YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE CC WILL SPEAK TO. AND THEN ON THE LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SIDES. MAKING SURE THAT THIS CHANGE WORKS FOR SMALL FLEETS YOU KNOW WORKS FOR EQUITY COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO THAT THE GOOD NEWS GETS OUT IS ON THESE HUGE PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. AND BEGIN TO REALLY TAKE OFF BY THEM THE FURNITURE HELP SHIELD ON ANYTHING HE IS HERE. I THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION IF I COULD JUST ASK OUT IF YOU COULD GIVE US THE INFORMATION OF WHERE THOSE PLANTS ARE GONNA COME THOSE- THREE ADDITIONAL ONES I'D- APPRECIATE IT. THANKS VERY MUCH SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER LEE. THANK YOU CHAIR I HAD HOPED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WOULD EVENTUALLY ASK MY QUESTIONS BUT- I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION BEFORE- FOR CC I THINK WOULD BE MOST EFFICIENT. WELL FIRST OF ALL I'M VERY EXCITED THAT POTENTIAL PERHAPS TO HAVE ANOTHER A TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE WE NEED I THINK ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE HERE. BUT IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT GRAY BLUE AND GREEN HYDRANT DO WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IS A STATE WHAT IS THE BREAK UP PERCENTAGE OF HYDROGEN BEING PRODUCED IS A MAJORITY ONE VERSION OR THE OTHER. YES WE DO SO- UNFORTUNATELY GRANT HUNDREDS IS ONLY ABOUT 1% OR SO OF THE HYDROGEN BEING. PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA- AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE POINT THE VAST MAJORITY BUDGET BOTH DOMESTICALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND GLOBALLY IS- FROM FOSSIL FUELS. AND THAT'S JUST A FUNCTION OF COST I MEAN IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET IS VERY IN TUNE TO THAT AND AS I MENTIONED. THE COST IS ROUGHLY TWO DOLLARS A KILOGRAM WERE THE GRAY HYDROGEN AND IN THE FIVE TO TEN NINE DOLLARS FOR A GREEN TODAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AM LITERALLY COLOR BLIND SO I COULDN'T TELL IF I COULD SEE IT. I WOULD SAY THAT- THAT LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD PROGRAM I'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE HELPS THE SEAT THAT FURTHER SO ONE THING THAT IS ONE REEMPHASIZE THAT HAVEN'T CONTINUED SIGNAL. OUR PRODUCTION PROTHESIS REDUCE CARBON INTENSITY. SHOULD HELP TRACKING PRIVATE INVESTMENTS WHERE WE ONCE IN. BUT I STILL BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT COLOR THEY ARE. I'LL NEVER BE A FIGHTER PILOT. OKAY YOU KNOW I HAD A QUESTION SIMILAR TO MR LEE'S QUESTION ON THE HYDROGEN CLASSIFICATIONS BY COLOR I BELIEVE OF THE SPEAKER FROM CARB MENTION THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON ANY GOALS BY CLASSIFICATION- PRODUCTION METHOD. YOU KNOW BUT EACH HYDROGEN PRODUCTION METHOD HAS A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SO I WAS CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WOULD BE READY. OR WHY YOU SAID THAT LIKE RIGHT NOW THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE PRODUCTION METHOD OF HYDROGEN. WHAT THIS IS AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF IT I DON'T WANT FOR A SECOND TO SUGGEST THAT WE THINK ABOUT PRODUCTION MANY FEEL THAT WE DON'T NEED TO THINK ABOUT OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL. PIECES OF THE PUZZLE NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW SOME ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE DISTRICTS AND RATHER REGULATORY BODIES. IT JUST COMES TO THE CARBON INTENSITY PUZZLE THAT'S ONE WHERE OUR PARTICULAR TOOL NOT LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND SOME OF HER RELATED POLICIES. HAPPENS TO REALLY BE FOCUSED ON THE PARTICULAR PATHWAYS FOR PARTICULAR FUEL AND ITS CARBON INTENSITY. IT JUST MEANS THAT RATHER THAN USING THESE HEURISTICS OF COLOR WE CAN TO REALLY BE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S TRUE ABOUT THIS PATHWAY WHICH DOES HAVE THE BENEFIT OF PROVIDING THAT I SHARED SIGNAL. IN ACROSS THAT MARKET TO CONTINUE REDUCING INTENSITY REGARDLESS OF HOW IT'S PRODUCED BUT AGAIN THAT IS TO SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT INDUSTRIAL AIR POLICY DON'T SUGGEST OTHERWISE. JUST HAPPENS TO BE WITHIN THE SORT OF GHG. FRAME ON THE TROLLEYS. SO I HAVE A I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME- FIRST AND I THINK THIS IS FOR CC BUT EITHER YOU CAN. ANSWER IT- GIVEN THAT. THE INDUSTRY ESTIMATES THAT THE POPULATION OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE SIXTY ONE THOUSAND BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SHOULD WE BE SPENDING. THIS MONEY ON HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE WE GETTING AHEAD OF THE MARKET HERE. WITH THE FUELING STATIONS ALL ASSET TO CC. SO THAT IS THE CHOICES ABOUT BECAUSE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING. AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THAT SETS THE TWO HUNDRED STATION GOAL AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE AND SO WE ARE AND IN FACT EIGHTY EIGHT HAD DIRECTED AT THAT CARVED OUT. OF YOU KNOW PORTION OF OUR FUNDS FOR FUEL CELLS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS A STEP BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. ITHINK AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE. GOING TO BE- EVOLUTIONS IN THE MARKET WHERE- YOU KNOW. WALDRON EACH FOR FOUR DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY CALPERS BECOMES REALLY CLEAR- I WOULD SAY TEN YEARS AGO WAS NOT CLEAR AT ALL WITH THE FUTURE PASSENGER VEHICLES. WAS GONNA LOOK WORK- AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BEEN- OVERWHELMINGLY TRENDING TOWARDS HIS I THINK. YOU KNOW SIMILARLY WITH WITH HYDROGEN YOU KNOW LOOKING AT OTHER THESE OTHER NATIONS AND THEIR STUFF IT'S REALLY HARD TO ELECTRIFY- THAT I'M TAKING YOU KNOW SB NATION- CERTAINLY LONG HAUL AVIATION. ELEMENTS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RAIL LOCATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL POWER SECTOR- WHERE WE CAN REALLY SEE. AN ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW THIS POINT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE THAT WAS GIVEN TO US SOME YEARS AGO BURKE. GOING TO- STAY ON COURSE. UNTIL WE GET TO TWO HUNDRED. LET ME ASK YOU MENTION THE CARBON. ROAD MAP THAT YEAH DOES THAT DOCUMENT. HOW YOU SITE THESE STATIONS AND WHAT IS THE STRATEGY AS TO WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING THEM ARE YOU LOOKING AT FOR INSTANCE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLE CLASSES AND- HOW DO YOU MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHERE THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO GO. YES THAT'S ALSO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS YOU ARE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WE TAKE A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND TRYING TO LOOK COMPREHENSIVELY. I DO THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR NOW- HENRYSON MORE WHO SHOULD BE GIVING THIS PRESENTATION BUT ISN'T BECAUSE HE'S VISITING US. IS A BIG TOUR OF LITHIUM VALLEY- TODAY IS MUCH MORE ABOUT- UP TO SPEED AS HE RUNS ARE. I CAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION- BUT THAT'S THAT'S ALSO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS THE HYDROGEN. ROADMAP THAT ATTENTION IS MORE ROAD MAP FOR OUR RESEARCH INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE EPIC PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO THE CONTRACT- IN THE COMING MONTHS HOW TO REALLY GET VERY GRANULAR WAY DOWN TO THE DETAIL EXACTLY WHERE. THE BEST INVESTMENT OF OUR HYDROGEN RESEARCH MONEY. NEEDS TO GO TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST ONE MILLION SPECIFICALLY. FIVE HUNDRED RESEARCH. THANK YOU- ARE YOU TALKING TO THE AG INDUSTRY ABOUT HYDROGEN APPLICATIONS IN AGRICULTURE IN TERMS OF- AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES FOR INSTANCE JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOU KNOW HOW BECAUSE I DID SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF AGRICULTURAL HYDROGEN VEHICLES WHICH WAS PRETTY EXCITING YOU KNOW AND GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES THAT ARE YOU KNOW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF ACRES IN DIFFERENT PLACES ALL THE TIME I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR HYDROGEN FUEL. AS AS AS AS ZERO EMISSION FUELING FOR THESE VEHICLES WHETHER YOU'RE THINKING AT ALL ABOUT WHAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE IF ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. SO I HAVE NOT MYSELF TALK TO ANYONE. OUR CULTURE INTO A HYDROGEN. VEHICLES TO APPLICATIONS I HAVE VISITED MARC IS ELECT TRACTOR COMPANY THAT'S NOW AND LEARN MORE- LARGEST ELECTRIC CHARGING COMPANY RESIDENT THEY'RE SELLING OF MID SIZED TRACTORS- I I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT- BURKE YOU ALSO BUT I'M NOT. I DON'T KNOW CRAIG ARE YOU- YOU ENGAGED IN THAT SPACE YOU KNOW SOMEONE AND I GUESS WHAT I'D SAY THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN A PARTICULAR- FUEL CELL USES AND TRACTORS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT COULDN'T BE A THING AND AS EVER IN EVERY CULTURE THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT SPACES THERE THINK FOR INSTANCE OF WAREHOUSES WHERE FORKLIFTS ARE HUGE DEAL AND FUEL CELLS ARE GOOD USE FORM- SIMILARLY THERE MAY BE OTHER FORMS IN THE APARTMENT WHERE THIS MAKES SENSE. ONE THING THAT'S TRUE IN AGRICULTURAL USES YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHICH TECHNOLOGIES GET INTRODUCED AGENCIES ACKNOWLEDGES MOVE AND SPREAD INTO THOSE SPACES SO THIS MADMAN HOPEFUL ANSWERS WATCH THIS SPACE AND ANYTHING CREATING IN. THIS POOL OF PROJECTSAND FUNDS SHOULD HELP DRIVE CHANGE THERE TOO THANKS I THINK THIS IS FOR CAR BUT- HOW IS THE STATE TRACKING PROGRESS OR TRENDS IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND ITS IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY AND POLLUTION I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT EMISSIONS BUT ARE YOU ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT ON YOUR QUALITY AND KNOCKS AND OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTION'S WOULD OCCUR JUST. WITH REGARD TO HYDROGEN SPECIFICALLY. SO I'M CERTAINLY ARE A GET ON THE WAY INTO TOWN TO. THAT'S BECAUSE THE- GUIDE WHAT SAY. IS CARD HAS JUST AND LET YEAR RENEWAL ADVANCE. IN ITS MY AND REPORTING PROGRAMS FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL SOURCES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE AND ANY AND SEE HOW GIN PRODUCTION FACILITIES TO MY KNOWLEDGE AT LEAST INCLUDING THE SUN. KRITERIEN TOXICS REPORTING REGULATION WHICH IS PHASE IN OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND REALLY HELPS US TRACK. ON THAT FACILITY BEHAVIOR SO WELL I CAN'T TODAY GIVE YOU PARTICULAR NUMBERS AND HYDROGEN PRODUCTION CRITERIA POLLUTANTS BUT I CAN SAY. THAT WE'VE SEEN MUCH MUCH DEEPER INVESTMENTS BOTH A MODERATE OF EXPOSURES- TO COMMUNITIES AROUND REFINERIES OTHER SOURCES. AND SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN RECORDING- REGULATIONS ON ALL INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THANKS TO THIRTY PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO THERE'S A LOT. OF INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATORY INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY THERE AND ENSURE MORE TO DEAL WHICH I'M SURE WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON WHEN. MY STAFF AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M MISSING. THANKS I'LL ASK BOTH OF YOU- WHAT ADDITIONAL POLICIES ARE CONSIDERATIONS YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING. WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH PER. AND DISTRIBUTION TO HELP US MEET OUR- CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA'S OR ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH WE WERE DOING. OR THAT WERE MISSING THAT WILL. HELP ASSIST YOUR EFFORTS. AND WHEN IT COMES TO OUR GOALS. NO MADAM CHAIR MY MIND I THINK THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW IN THIS SPACE IS THE OPPORTUNITY GET FEDERAL MONEY INTO CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL RIGHT. I DO THINK IT BE HELPFUL FOR. PERHAPS YOUR TO COMMITTEES TOOK TO CONVENE- THE STAKEHOLDERS AGAIN- ON HYDROGEN TO BETTER COORDINATE ON A JOINT CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL I THINK. WE WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN PROBABLY ANY OTHER REGION. IN THE COUNTRY TO DIRECT THIS MONEY INTELLIGENTLY AND HELP IT. SUPPORT SERVICE SMART DEVOLUTION OF ONCE THIS SECTOR- AND SO YOU KNOW BUT IT WOULD BE A BIG WIN FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET. A MEANINGFUL HUB IN THIS AREA. THANK I'LL JUST HAVE TWO THINGS I'M IN SPEAKING JUST MYSELF AND THAT BALLING YEAH THE FIRST IS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR YOU READY PERMITTING THAT IS HEALTH PROTECTIVE IN COMMUNITY PROTECTION. AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES I THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL NOT JUST FOR HYDROGEN BUT FOR OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD BACK BETTER FAST ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF CLIMATE POLICY TRYING TO BUILD. NOW OUR WAY FORWARD THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND ANOTHER PIECE HOLDS KNOWN AS FOR ESPECIALLY THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE ON THREE MANAGERS TO LOOK PRETTY FAR AHEAD SO THE SORTS OF MULTI YOUR PACKAGES LEGISLATURES DECIDED ON THE PAST FEW YEARS AND FUNDING. I'M HAVING A REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK REALLY CLEAR STUDY FINDING ON A STATE PROGRAMS AND WHAT FOLKS NOT TO THAT AND NOW HOW TO PLAN THEIR FLEETS INTO ZERO EMISSION WILL HELP PROVIDING A GREAT DEAL. OF ROOM ON ON BOTH ON. BETTER ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND THANKS FOR ASKING THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT YOU HAD NOT ANOTHER QUESTION OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM SURE FOR LETTING ME COME BACK AND UP JUST DOUBLE DUTIES AS QUICK AS I CAN ONE I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT- PROBABLY THE ONLY SILVER LINING OF THE TRAGEDY THAT'S GOING ON TODAY IN THE WORLD IT'S RESULTING IN THE HIGHER FUEL PRICES IS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO ACCELERATE. THE ADOPTION OF HOUSE OF TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE- BOTH- THE CC AND CARB- IDENTIFYING THAT THE GOAL IS NOT ANY TECHNOLOGY THE GOAL IS TO THE TO THE MISSION AND THAT IS TO DECREASE THE EMISSIONS OVERALL- BUT FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE MORE NOVICES. COULD YOU PLEASE AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY COMES FROM THE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION- AND- CHAIR HARSH GOT CHILD- COULD YOU JUST SUMMARIZE GIVE US THE ELEVATOR PITCH THE SIXTY SECOND PITCH AS TO WHY- HYDROGEN SEEMS TO BE BETTER FOR HEAVY DUTY- RIGHT NOW. THAT'S IT'S IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE REPORT HERE- BUT- COULD COULD YOU COULD YOU IDENTIFY THAT OR WHOEVER IS THE APPROPRIATE PERSON ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES USES THE RANGE OF THE VEHICLES ARE WHICH YOU KNOW FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING AND SO FORTH. ARE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW- THE- ABILITY TO DO LONG RANGE. ISN'T THERE FOR EASY TRUCKING OBVIOUSLY TESLA HAS ELECTRIC SEMI IN DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OTHERS. THAT ARE LOOKING FOR LONG RANGE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME LIKE MID RANGE YOUR MOTIVES DURING ELECTRIC. TRUCK YOU KNOW FOR DELIVERY VEHICLES AND SO I'M- BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE IS. THE AREA WHERE HE IS OUR WEAKEST. TODAY AT THIS POINT SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE- DO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF. Y. SE FUEL CELLS ARE. ARE STRONGER IN THAT POSITION THAN ON PAST YOUR CALLS COULD COULD ANY OF THIS COMMUNITY ASIDE SCIENTIST. TALK ABOUT JUST FROM A SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND HYDROGEN VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND THEN THE FUEL CELL BATTERY IS THERE. IS THERE ARE AND ENERGY INTENSITY THERE THAT HELPS WITH THE. HEAVY DUTY. I THINK IT'S MORE OF AN DENSE. SO YOU'RE ABLE TO GET FUEL. SMALLER SPACE- YOU KNOW TERMS OF THE BILL TO GO- ALONG RANGE. THAT'S YOUR ADVANCE. FROM ANY IT'S PER THAT MENTIONED. IT'S A- HALF OF THE- TRICITY- TO DO ELECTRIC VEHICLE PER MILE THAN A FUEL CELL VEHICLE BUT THE DENSITY OF THE HYDROGEN IS IT IS A VALUE. FOR AND RENT AND SO FORTH IF WE GET INTO JUST RECHARGING TIMES EXETER RIGHT THERE THERE'S A REFERENCE IN THE REPORT THAT SAYS A SUBSET OF VEHICLE MARKET WILL STILL REQUIRE FREQUENT RELATIVELY FAST REFUELLING PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER VEHICLE CLASSES. AND SO- MIGHT AT AND JUST LIKE TO CHECK AND SEE. I'M I AM I UNDERSTAND MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU COULD REFUEL FASTER WITH HYDROGEN THEN YOU CAN RECHARGING THE BATTERY- AND SO THIS IS JUST THIS IS THAT'S THE STATISTIC THAT I HAVE IN MY HEAD AND I JUST LIKE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT. THERE IF YOU PULL IN- WITH THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES RIGHT NOW JUST TO KEEP. COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES- A LIGHT DUTY EVEY PULLS IN TO US TO A STATION- IT'S GOING TO TAKE. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TIME FORTY MINUTES OR SO TO CHARGE UP- WHEREAS A LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN CAR PULLING INTO THE STATION COULD CHARGE IN ABOUT FIVE. MINUTES MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THE REFUELING STATIONS SUBSIDIES THAT WE'RE GIVING IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION AS YOU SAID FOR HYDROGEN AND ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE E. IS FOR THE- HE IS THE- HE TO. REGULARLY AND SO BASICALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS MUCH. BUT ON A PER VEHICLE BASIS IF YOU COULD CHARGE TEN TIMES AS MANY VEHICLES. AT THAT HYDROGEN STATION AS YOU CAN AT THE E. V. STATION DOWN ON JUST A JUST STRAIGHT UP PER VEHICLES BASIS. THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE SUBSIDY BECAUSE YOU CAN CHARGE TEN TIMES AS MANY VEHICLES BECAUSE YOU CAN CHARGING FASTER AND MIKE AM I. IN THE BOOK I THINK THIS IS A THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT I MEAN REALLY THE HYDROGEN FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE PUTTING ITS MORE KNOWLEDGE AS TO A GAS STATION. NOW HAVING SAID THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE V. CHARGING IS WE'RE MOVING TO FASTER FASTER CHART SO THERE IS A THREE AND A FIFTY K. W. YOU CHARGER. THAT'S THROUGH THE U. L. TESTING RIGHT NOW AND BEING DEPLOYED WHICH IS A HUNDRED MILES OF CHARGE IN FIVE MINUTES OR TWO HUNDRED MILES CHARGING IN TEN MINUTES WE JUST FUNDED A PROJECT A TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. FOR US K. W. BUS CHARGER SO THE CHARGING STE IS ALSO OUR RECORD. INCREASING SO. WHAT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE THOSE ARE VERY ARE IN THE MARKET TODAY BUT THAT'S THE DIRECTION IT'S GOING TO BE A SUBSET OF. VERY VERY FAST CHARGING- NO IT'S A CHARGER FOR MY WILL BE INS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WILL BE AT. A HIGHER STE IT DOES WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO PUT IN THE IN THE- IN THE EAST TO YES. SO ACTION. FASTER BUT THEY WILL COME CLOSER TO THE CHURCH'S SORT OF LIKE A HYDROGEN IT COSTS- SO TO GET TO THAT A FAST SPEED YOU COULD DO THAT- AND THEN- IT. THE TWO OTHER THINGS I JUST LIKE TO CHECK MY UNDERSTANDING AS TOYOTA IS GOING TO HAVE TO DRIVE TRAINS FOR FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY READY BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IS THAT THE DATA THAT YOU AND CARP HAVE BECAUSE ONCE THE ONCE THAT IS SET BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S THEIR GOAL THEN WE WOULD START HAVING. THE ABILITY TO MORE MASS PRODUCED AS A QUESTION WAS OUT THERE YOU KNOW WE GET WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE BUT THEY'RE MAKING HYDROGEN TO HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BY HAND VIRTUALLY- BUT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS THAT IS THAT THE DATA THAT YOU DID TO ANYBODY AND EITHER THE TWO DEPARTMENTS HAS FROM TOWARD OTHERS. READING ON THE CONSUMER TIME AT THE PASSENGER VEHICLE SIDE OF IT SO THERE ARE THREE COMPANIES THAT- BY THE BY THE END OF FIVE TWENTY FOUR. ARE HAVE ANNOUNCED PASSENGER FUEL CELL VEHICLES THAT'S TOYOTA AND HONDA YEAH YOU HAVE W. AND I'M SORRY MY QUESTIONS ABOUT HEAVY. DUTY THESE ARE DRIVE TRAIN FRONT- YEAH I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. ADS ON PAGES THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD BY TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE SYMPTOM SO MAYBE SOMEBODY HAS AT AND- MY FINAL. COMMENT IS. BOB I THINK IT WAS CRAIG THERE FROM CARB MADE THE COMMENT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU'VE SEEN AND I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT I HEARD THAT RIGHT IS THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN THAT THAT YOU THINK IS A IS A VERY LIKELY POSSIBILITIES AT THEIR- ONCE YOU START IN THE HEAVY DUTY IF YOU FOCUS HYDROGEN ON THE HEAVY DUTY ONCE YOU START AND HEAVY DUTY. THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPAND INTO THE LIGHT DUTY YOU DID DID I HEAR THAT CORRECT CRAIG IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE IMPLYING A THREE YEAH AND TO BE CLEAR THAT GOES BOTH WAYS BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ONES WHERE. SOLVING THE UNIQUE PROBLEM IN THAT SPACE CONSCIOUS THAT OF ENGINEERING VALUE IT HELPS US LEARN THAT HELPS US FIGURE OUT NO ARRAY TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE SEE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER RECORD EXPERIMENTED IN LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY. AND HEAVY DUTY FOLKS CAN BE FIGURING OUT BIGGER MORE POWERFUL VEHICLES IN A LARGE SCALE ENERGY DELIVERY LOTTA USEFUL MUTUAL INTERACTIONS HEARING BOTH SIDES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SUMMARY THANK YOU SURE WOMEN IN THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING- GONNA. PRETEXT THIS SOME OF MY BACKGROUND ON ALL OF THIS- WITH THE ADVENT OF LOSING ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE THAT MAKES ME THE LAST DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- LEGISLATIVE ENERGY HORIZON INSTITUTE GRADUATE LEFT IN THIS BUILDING- AND BEFORE MY TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY- I KNOW A LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT I'M A VETERAN BULLET- THEY A SERVE TEN YEARS IS A TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS SERGEANT DEALING WITH HEAVY DUTY- IN MOVING VEHICLES ALL OVER IRAQ AND KUWAIT. THE PORTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE- SO TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT I'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY HEARD- FRANKLY EUROPE'S ALREADY MOVED FORWARD ON A LOT OF THIS ON MY ACCOUNT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS NOW HEARING THAT WE'RE WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT AT TESTING AND PROJECTS VERSES MOVING FORWARD IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FUEL STATIONS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO LOOK AT LARGE THIS FLEETS. ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THE ENTIRE NETWORK. IT IS BASED UPON GOING IN AND FEELING. IT AND THEN MOVING FORWARD. AS FAR AS HEAVY DUTY FLEETS TO MISTER BENNETT'S QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP I KNOW TOYOTA HYUNDAI MERCEDES BENZ ARE ALREADY IN MASS PRODUCTION OF LARGE. HEAVY DUTY- THE TRUCKS TO REPLACE THE EIGHTEEN WHEELERS FOR MOVING FREIGHT IN AND THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THIS IN EUROPE AUSTRALIA IN THE ASIAN MARKETS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD. YOU THESE GUYS ARE LEAVING US IN THE DUST. ON WE NEED TO GET CAUGHT UP OF THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE'RE TRULY GOING TO GO- MY QUESTION FOR CARVE IN. TWO TO THE FOLKS ON THE PANEL. WHAT PARTNERSHIPS ARE BEING BUILT WITH EXISTING FUEL STATION COMPANIES LATELY GLOVES AND- FLYERS IN THESE OTHERS THAT THE DEAL WITH THE HEAVY DUTY. COMMERCIAL TRUCKING FLEETS BECAUSE WHAT A I THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING IS LOOKING AT THOSE PARTNERSHIPS YORDY HAVE FEEL STATIONS THAT ARE BUILT. THE WAY HYDROGEN WORKS IS IT'S NOT A CHARGE IT SEES GUYS PULL WHEN THEY STICK IT IN THERE AND THEY FEEL IT UP AND THEN THEY GO. SO IF THEY GOT A RUN IN AND GO TO THE BATHROOM AND GRAB SOME% SNACKS MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES. BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT STUCK THERE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S HOW TRANSPORTATION WORKS. THE ON THE DAY TO DAY. SO WE SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING T PARTNERSHIPS WITH THESE GUYS ALREADY DO THIS ALREADY IN BUSINESS THIRTY MOVING FORWARD BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT WE'RE BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS WITH EXISTING FUEL STATIONS. BECAUSE IN THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON A DIFFERENT. SUMMITS AND DIFFERENT THINGS IS WE'VE DISCUSSED BRINGING HYDROGEN INTO THE MIX. IS HOW DO YOU SET UP A PROGRAM WHERE YOU CAN TELL THE TRUCK STOP COMPANY HEY YOU YOU'VE GOT DIESEL YOU'VE GOT GAS WHAT DOES IT TAKE US TO PUT A HYDROGEN TANK IN THERE FOR YOU GUYS RUN SOME HYDROGEN LINES OUT. WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SO EVENTUALLY WE CAN PUT IN A HYDROGEN TANKS IN AS WE CURB IN GET THE INDUSTRY GOING TO MOVE FORWARD THEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE DIESEL D. COMMISSIONER WHATEVER WHATEVER POINT WE EVENTUALLY GET TO THAT. WE NEED TO HEAR THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TODAY. IN IF THIS IS REALLY WERE GONNA GO THE STATE. TO INTEGRATE INTO NEW TECHNOLOGY THE EV'S IN IN THE ELECTRIC IT IT'S GREAT. ON THE SMALL SCALE FOR DRIVING A CAR AROUND A LARGE CITY THAT HAS ACCESS TO THIS FOR MY PEOPLE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE THE CHARGING STATIONS WE'RE WE'RE GETTING MORE MORE BUT- HE IS NOT THERE BUT I THINK OF WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD ON THE HEAVY DUTY SIDE WHICH IS WHERE. MOST OF THE- HARDER EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM IT THAT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE HEAVY DUTY YOU NEED TO LOOK AT PARTNERSHIPS AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING WHERE WE BRING IN SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE CHAIRWOMAN'S QUESTION WITH AGRICULTURE THEOTHER SOME SMALLER LIGHTER DUTY THINGS COMING ON SCALE BUT THE BIG MASSIVE TRACTORS. THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. I HOST MY JUST REALIZE THE WORLD EXPO EVERY YEAR. COME DOWN CHECK IT OUT THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY NEAT STUFF IN THIS REALM. BUT INTEL THE FUEL. IS THERE I MEAN AS A FARMER COULD IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO YOU KNOW. WHO KNOWS HOW LONG DOWN THE ROAD INSTEAD HAVING A DIESEL TANK OUT ON THEIR PROPERTY THEY CAN HAVE A HYDROGEN TANK. BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A STATE TO HELP THEM GET THERE. BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA GO HOME AND TELL MY GUYS HERE WE'RE GONNA SWITCH YOUR HYDROGEN WITHOUT HELPING THEM GET THERE AND THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST GAP THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE WE'VE PUSHED ALL OF THIS- THAT'S WHY WE WORK SO HARD ON CAP AND TRADE. WITH THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN MAKING SURE THAT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SWITCHING ENGINE TYPES FIXING THOSE HOLES BECAUSE IT USED TO BE DIESEL TO A CLEANER BURNING DIESEL TO THAN IN NEWER CLEANER BURNING DIESEL INSTEAD OF GOING DIESEL. TO ANOTHER ENGINE TYPE. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT MISSING THOSE THINGS- LIKE WHAT'S DONE IN THE PAST. SO AGAIN THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THEN JUST BRING IN A STAKEHOLDERS I'D LOVE TO SEE A HEARING WHERE WE BROUGHT IN YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FOLKS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY IN SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT DEAL WITH LARGE SCALE TRACTORS FROM THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY I'M I'M SURE THEY'D LOVE TO WEIGH IN ON SOME OF THESE THINGS THANK YOU MANAGER. MATHIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SHARE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE ACTUALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE SO WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH. ALTERING CALIFORNIA BUDGET FOR PROJECTS AND THE MARINE CORPS- TOLD ME THE 25% OF THEIR CASUALTIES THAT THEY TOOK AND RACKING UP KANSEN WERE ON. MISSIONS DELIVERING FUEL. I REALLY STUCK WITH ME- YEAH NO PART OF THE YET ANOTHER REASON WHY WE NEED TO TRANSITION KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST REALLY THE BEST PERSON TO SPEAK TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED. IS TERRORISTS WHO WAS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE QUICK TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS BUT DEALING WITH ALL THE HYDROGEN STATIONS AND AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. IT'S INVITE HIM TO CME PRESENT AND ACTUALLY SHOW YOU THE MAP OF WHERE I JUST STATIONS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE NOW. THE PLAN IN CASE. WHAT THE WHOLE NETWORK WILL LOOK LIKE- AND THEN YOU CAN TALK. AS WELL ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT WITH. THE VERY STATION OWNERS AS JUST. AS A FOLLOW UP WITH THAT STARTED. AND JUST TO CHIME IN BRIEFLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GOSH ARE YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT NEEDING TO GET SOME OF THOSE BIG PRIVATE FEELING COMPANIES EVEN FURTHER INTO THE GAME. AND SOME OF CARDS PROJECTS MATCHING GOING DOWN TOMORROW TO SEE AN EXISTING HYDROGEN- RATHER IT IS A FEELING ADDED TO EXISTING SHELL STATION THAT'S RUN AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OFF THE PORTS. WHICH IS GREAT SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON YOU HAVE SHOWN THAT STATION OWNERS THIS PROJECT CAN WORK. WELL JUST TELL YEAH WITHOUT THROWING ANY PARTICULAR- EXTRACT COMPANY UNDER THE BUS. SOMETIMES THE FOLKS THERE WHO ARE UNDULY CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN OTHER WORDS THERE WAITING AND SEEING I GET THAT. NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT BUSINESS DECISIONS. BUT I DO THINK THAT IT IS VALUABLE IN ADDITION TO SENDING REALLY CLEAR REGULATORY AND INCENTIVE SIGNALS HEY LOOK AT THE MARKETS COMING GET DOWN AT. THIS IS WE'VE SEEN UNLIKE YOU DECIDE YOU KNOW PRIVATE UNIQUE PRIVATE COMPANIES REALLY. JUMP IN THE IN THE FEELING. YEAH THIS IS ABOUT NEED TO BE ABOUT. I'VE I'M SURE KNOW THE C. C. TEAM IS HEARD WAY MORE THAN I HAVE ABOUT IT INFRASTRUCTURES THERE WERE OWN VEHICLES ARE MINE. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. AND ARE THERE IS VALUE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS REGISTRATION INTEREST THEIR POINT TO SOME EARLY PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE GOT. AND SAY THAT- SOMETIMES- IF YOU'VE BEEN IN ONE KIND OF BUSINESS FOR A WHILE YOU MAY MISS WHAT BIG BUSINESS LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE- ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS FOR FOLKS. ABSOLUTELY ALL THE BENEFIT FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT NEED BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS TO STEP UP AND HELP IN THE NATION. I AGREE WITH YOU BUT IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS. FOR THOSE THAT ARE- IS YOU SAY STRONGLY CONSERVATIVE AND. AND KIND OF- TO- FRAZIER WHICH OF STUCK IN THEIR WAYS- THE- CARE IT DEFINITELY WORKS BETTER THAN A STICK WITH A LOT OF THEM SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE A MORE CARROTS UNLESS STICKS. THANK OF CARROTS AND- HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING ON THAT AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU EVERYBODY THANKS FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION GREAT INFORMATION AND NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR SECOND AND LAST PANEL. FOR THIS PANEL EVERYONE WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES ALL OF THE PANELISTS. AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER WHO'S HERE IN PERSON WELCOME. JAMIE LEVIN THE DIRECTOR OF WEST COAST OPERATIONS FOR THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU FOR WAITING SO PATIENTLY. SEP CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. SURE FRIEDMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY INFORMATION ABOUT NOR CAL ZERO AN EXCITING HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC TRUCK PROJECT LARGELY FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES AND CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE I AM THE DIRECTOR OF WEST COAST OPERATIONS FOR THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION THE ENVIRONMENT A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH OFFICES IN BERKELEY LOS ANGELES ATLANTA AND MINNEAPOLIS ST PAUL THE MISSION OF OUR ORGANIZATION IS TO HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TWO ZERO EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR PLANET BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING BOTH CRITERIA AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AS A MEMBER BASED ORGANIZATION WE REPRESENT OVER EIGHTY SIX MEMBERS FROM INDUSTRY PUBLIC AGENCIES UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER NONPROFITS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE NOR CAL'S ZERO WILL BE THE LARGEST DEPLOYMENT OF CLASS EIGHT FUEL CELL ELECTRIC TRUCKS IN NORTH AMERICA WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST FUELING STATIONS IN THE WORLD CAPABLE OF FUELING SIXTY TRUCKS PER DAY WAS SIXTY KILOGRAMS OF FUEL PER TRACK. ALTHOUGH OUR PROJECT WILL BE DEPLOYING ONLY THIRTY TRUCKS IN THIS PILOT DEMONSTRATION THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ENDEAVOR IS REALLY ABOUT PAVING THE WAY TO DEPLOY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS THAT OPERATE TO AND FROM OUR MARITIME PORTS IN REGIONAL LOCATIONS AND DESTINATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE TO FLEET OPERATORS THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY A FUEL CELL ELECTRIC TRUCKS BY PROVING THAT THESE VEHICLES CAN REPLACE DIESEL AND SEE AND- THE TRACKS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN C. D. E. ORGANIZED A GROUP OF FOURTEEN ORGANIZATIONS FROM THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS TO COMPETE FOR CARBON C. E. C. FUNDING. ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IN THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT COMMITTED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FUNDS IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY INCLUDING HYUNDAI MOTOR COMPANY AND FIRST ELEMENT FUEL COMMITTED ANOTHER SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN COST SHARE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR PROJECT PROPOSAL WAS AWARDED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS FROM CARBON C. E. C. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. BEGINNING IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND OPERATING FOR SIX YEARS THEREAFTER THESE TRUCKS WILL SERVICE DESTINATIONS IN THE BAY AREA SACRAMENTO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WITH A RANGE OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILES THEY'RE PROJECTED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY FOUR THOUSAND METRIC TONS PER YEAR CRITERION MISSIONS BY OVER TWO TONS PER YEAR. AND PETROLEUM FUEL CONSUMPTION BY OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS PER YEAR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT DISTINGUISHES FUEL CELL ELECTRIC TRUCKS FROM OTHER ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES IS AN EXTENDED RANGE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILES WITH BE NEARLY EQUIVALENT TO A DIESEL TRUCK CARRYING FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF PAYLOAD. THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY RE FUEL THESE TRUCKS IN TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES WILL ENABLE FLEET OPERATORS TO OPERATE MULTIPLE TRIPS WITH NEGLIGIBLE DOWNTIME THE SAME REASON FUEL CELL ELECTRIC FORKLIFTS ARE NOW A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. FOR WAREHOUSE OPERATION NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. INITIALLY THE FUEL SUPPLY WILL BE SOURCED FROM CARBON INTENSITY OF ZERO. BUT I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT FUEL CELLS ARE AGNOSTIC. TO THE SOURCES OF HYDROGEN SO THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR OUR INDUSTRY IS TO PROVIDE A AN AFFORDABLE PRICE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING SOME OF OUR TRUCKS TO TRANSPORT THE HYDROGEN FROM PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND DISTRIBUTION HUBS. TO FUELING STATIONS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE TRUCKS WE ARE DEPLOYING HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR IN UPGRADE TWO TRUCKS PRESENTLY DEPLOYED IN SWITZERLAND WHERE THEY HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THEIR COMMERCIAL VIABILITY. THE GOAL WEIGHT IN EXCESS OF NINETY THOUSAND POUNDS HAVE NAVIGATED ONE AND A HALF MILLION MILES WITH VERY LITTLE DOWN TIME FOR MAINTENANCE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED OF THESE TRUCKS WILL BE OPERATIONAL THROUGHOUT SWITZERLAND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE FINALLY I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FORTY TWO THE SALE THE STATE SALES TAX EXEMPTION BILL FOR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETED GOALS OF 1100% OF ALL TRUCK SALES AND 1100% OF ALL DRAYAGE TRUCKS IN SERVICE TO BE ZERO EMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THEN HELPING TO REDUCE THE COST OF THIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR EARLY ADOPTERS WILL BE CRITICAL TO PAVING THE WAY FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW WITH MORE AFFORDABLE PRICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN TIME AND AGAIN GIVING ME FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY- I HAVE VERY GOOD OPINIONS ABOUT HOW THE STATE CAN LEVERAGE ITS FUNDING FOR THE HYDROGEN HUB PROGRAM THE EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR. PROGRAM SO IF THAT'S A QUESTION THAT YOU WISH TO ASK I HAVE AN OPINION TO OFFER THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA WAIT AND TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END AFTER THE PANEL BUT I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU UP TO ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW ABOUT. THAT BACK IF I FORGET YOU CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND ANSWER OKAY OKAY THANK YOU SO DON'T GO FAR YOU MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON HERE IN OUR PERSON. SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TO STAY THERE OKAY OKAY THAT OUR NEXT- HANDLE IS TO BUY ZOOM IS KEPT- KEVIN SHERIDAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TRI VALLEY SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONAL RAIL AUTHORITY OR- OTHERWISE KNOWN AS VALLEY LINK FOR GOOD REASONS THANKS YOU'RE- YOU'RE UP NEXT KEVIN. HE RAN MY CHAIR REMAIN RE. AND CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATION DAY AND I FEEL LIKE. PROJECT I'M ABOUT READY TO SHIP ITS- VERY MUCH TOWARDS VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION. THAT IS OCCURING SUMMER SHARE MY SCREEN NOW. WHERE EVERYBODY CAN SEE THAT OKAY. NOT GO TO THE BALLOT LINK PROJECT THANK YOU. BOTTLING'S SEEKING TO BE A 100% SELF SUFFICIENT AND TO BE A MODEL OF SUSTAINABILITY AND PASSENGER RAIL. ON THE COURT OR THE NEWPORT OR- IS APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO MILES LONG WITH SEVEN STATIONS IN A MAINTENANCE FACILITY. DALY COMMUTERS ARE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. THE AVERAGE DAILY- VEHICLES TRAVELED IN THE CORRIDOR OF OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND VEHICLES TODAY. WE GO TO THE SOMEWHAT QUICKLY TO GET TO THE HYDROGEN PLANT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN MEGA REGION IN THIS PROJECT IS CONSIDERED- BALLACK IS CONSIDERED A MEGA REGION PROJECT AS IT LINKS. ASSEMBLY KEEN COUNTY TO ALAMEDA COUNTY TRI VALLEY BUT ALSO OTHER COMMUTERS ARE COMMON AS FAR SOUTH AS- STANISLAUS COUNTY. AND DINNER THE REASON FOR THOSE MAKING COMMUTES ARE HARDLY JOBS IN HOUSING BALANCE. IN BALANCE AND IT FOR EVERY SIX NEW JOBS ARE CREATED IN THE BAY AREA. ONLY ONE HOUSE IT IS AVAILABLE AND- THOSE UNDERSTAND WILL HOUSING COSTS- IF YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOTTOM THERE ONE HOUSE ONE HOUSE IN A VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY THREE HOUSES IN NORTH SAN JOAQUIN. VALLEY TRAFFIC IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY 60% SHE COULD SEE THAT THE PICTURE THERE ON FIVE EIGHTY A THAT IS A COLLECTION THAT THAT. OCCURS DAILY. FROM FIVE THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO NOT- TO NINE THIRTY THE PEAK HOUR IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENING- TWO THIRTY TO SEVEN JUST FLIP IT OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD- AND I'M GOING WEST AT EASTBOUND ANNOUNCE WHAT TRAFFIC LOOKS LIKE SO IT'S A HIGHLY CONGESTED CORRIDOR. IN THE MEGA REGION. BOB BALLINGER ALSO CONNECTS IS A STANDALONE PROJECT IN WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR THE CORPORATE ALSO CONNECTS- OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS IN THE REGION SUCH AS BY RAIL WHICH IS EXTENDING- THE EXISTING COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE FROM SACRAMENTO TO. MERCED WHERE- VENTURI- DIæN WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THEN. AS IT COMES OVER THE YELLOW LINE TO THE GREEN LINE WHICH IS VIOLATED THAT PROVIDES CONNECTION TO. THAT PART. IN THE SPIRIT. SO ARE THE BALLOT BOARD ESTABLISHED A SUSTAINABILITY POLICY WITH THE GOAL TO BE A MODEL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE DESIGN CONSTRUCTION OPERATION THE BOTTLING SYSTEM WITH A LOT OF THE TOPICS DISCUSSED TODAY BEING THE FOCUS IN THAT SUSTAINABILITY POLICY SO IT WAS EXCITING TO HEAR ALL THE ROBUST DISCUSSION ON OUR HYDROGEN AND ZERO EMISSIONS AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES TODAY AT THE HEARING. SOME OF THOSE SUSTAINABILITY IN ACTION OUR SELECTION OF ITS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. RING ENERGY PRODUCTION STATION AREA PLANNING AROUND THE STATIONS AND INNOVATIVE STATION ACCESS SUCH AS- A POLICY YOUR GOALS SHOT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. SO WITH THAT IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR A HYDROGEN RAIL- WE DID NOT WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION I'LL AND DID NOT WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE TRYING TO BUILD OUR REGION RIGHT AFTER THE FACT. SO NOW IT HAS TWO HUNDRED ACRES LOCATED IN THE CITY OF TRACY VETERANS SET ASIDE FOR MAINTENANCE FACILITY. AND A SENIOR AND THE PICTURE OF THE WHITE AREA IS ENERGY FARMER I DO GET QUITE STORAGE RAWLING WANTS TO BE THE FIRST- PASSENGER RAIL START UP. WITH ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY NOT CONVERT BUT TO ACTUALLY START UP. THAT WAY AND INSTRUCTORS I DO CHEN PLANT AHEAD OF TIME. AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE TRI VALLEY. AND SURROUNDING THIS LOCATION IS ALSO A LOT OF OUR GREAT. AND GOODS MOVEMENT WHAT TRUCKS YEAH MAINLY THE WAREHOUSING THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE LARGEST- AREAS OF CONSTRUCTION IS WHERE HOUSING IN THIS AREA SO DON'T BE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH. SOME OF THOSE WAREHOUSES THAT ARE SEEKING TO YOU. THE HYDROGEN POWER FOR TRUCK FOR LONG HAUL AND HEAVY DUTY SO THIS IS A HEAVY DUTY ARM FIVE FACILITY THAT SCALABLE AND INITIAL SCALE WILL BE TO BUILD A HYDROGEN FACILITY TO START. FEELING LOSSES WHAT CONTRA COSTA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY- LIVERMORE ORDER VALUE TRANSPORTATION. AND ALSO A COUNTY COURT OR IN THE TRI VALLEY AND- FRANKLY ANY OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE AREA THAT. SEEKS TO USE HYDROGEN WE HAVE HAPPENED A VALUABLE SOURCE OF HYDROGEN HELPED FUEL THOSE BUSES AND THEN ONCE THE RAIL IS CONSTRUCTED. AND THAT THE TRAINS ARE BEING BUILT- NOW SAMBAR DINO IS GETTING SOME OF THE FIRST HYDROGEN TRAINS AND- R. I. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THOSE WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY TIME WE'RE FINISHED CONSTRUCTING. THE RAIL AND THEN WILL HAVE AVAILABILITY TO EXPAND THE HYDROGEN FACILITY BUT MORE TO CONTINUE WITH THE- GREEN AS POSSIBLE TYPE HYDROGEN READ. I MERRILY SOLAR. AND WIND DRIVEN. BUT ALSO TO BE UP ALSO IN STORE ON ON SITE AND YOUR YOUR TIME IS A BUT IF YOU CAN JUST FINISH UP PERHAPS FROM QUICKLY. I AM FINISHED SURE YOU IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO DO THAT LAST SLIDE IF YOU LIKE WITH YOUR YOUR FUNDING. WHEN I'M TO GO AHEAD AND QUICKLY GO THROUGH THAT. SO THIS IS A FUNDING THANK YOU SURE SO THIS IS THE FUNDING FOR THE OVERALL PROJECT. I CURRENTLY HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- SECURED AND THE GOAL WAS TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION Q. ARE COMPLETE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT BETWEEN DUBLIN PLEASANTON BART. AND MILHOUSE AND TRACY STATION MANAGER SHARP AND- THAT IS NOT THE COST OF THE START UP HYDROGEN PLANT THAT WE SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR RECENTLY A WORKING PARTNERSHIP WITH CONTRA COSTA. THAT'S MUCH LESS- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO KIND OF BUILD LARA I DO TO BE SOLELY BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE SECURED LANDING COMPLETED DEPARTMENT ALSO ACTUALLY READY TO. GO TO OUR INSTRUCTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW I'D LIKE TO WELCOME JULIE MCNAMARA. THE DEPUTY POLICY DIRECTOR- I'M SORRY NEXT TIME WELCOMING NEIL NOW BEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATIONS FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. THERE'S SOMEONE TO SHARE MY SCREEN. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO THIS WITHOUT SLICE OF THAT'S OKAY. AND WE ALSO SHARE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS UNTIL THEY'VE BEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATIONS RECYCLE GAS AND I OVERSEE OUR PORTFOLIO CLEAN ENERGY INNOVATION SOME PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR ROLE. AS A LONG TERM LEADER AND ENTER IN CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NEXT GENERATION HYDROGEN PRODUCTION A PROFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR QUALITY. I DON'T CHEN IS AN ESSENTIAL DECARBONISATION TOOL AND WHEN COUPLED WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY HUNDRED RESULTS IN A GLOBALLY SCALABLE. LOW AND ZERO EMISSIONS ENERGY SYSTEM THAT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. SO GAS CURRENTLY HAS TEN THE HYDROGEN PILOT PROJECTS EMOTIONS INCLUDING. ATTESTING NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ALSO HAVE A FEW KEY PROJECTS INCLUDING OUR AWARD WINNING H. TWO HUNDRED AND HOME WHICH WHEN COMPLETED THIS SUMMER WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW. CARBON FREE GAS MADE FROM RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY CAN BE USED TO FUEL CLEAN ENERGY SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE AND HOUSING. WE'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH SUNLINE TRANSIT AGENCY AND A THREE YEAR DEMONSTRATION PROJECT TO PRODUCE. CLEAN HYDROGEN FROM RENEWABLE HYDROGEN MANEUVERABLE NATURAL GAS TO FUEL THEIR FLEET OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS OR BUSES. AND JUST LAST MONTH WE ANNOUNCED A PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP THE ANGELES WINK. WHAT COULD BE ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST GREEN HYDROGEN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS. WILL DELIVER CLEAN RELIABLE INTO THE LOS ANGELES BASED. OUR VISION IS THAT THE ANGELES LINK CAN BE THE CORNERSTONE OF CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN ENTERTAINERS ECONOMY. AND WHAT POSITION ARE STATE TO BE THE CLEAN FUELS BOMBER. THE LOS ANGELES BASED FILM AS YOU KNOW IS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MANUFACTURING CENTER. MAKING IT ALL TOO MANY POTENTIAL GREEN HYDROGEN END USERS. WE KNOW TRANSPORTATION SOURCES PARTICULARLY HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION OR THE PRIMER. THERE'S JUST SMOG FORMATION IN THE REGION AND AS SUCH WE ENVISION THE ANGELES LINKS GREEN HYDROGEN PLAYING A ROLE IN REDUCING THE EMISSIONS FROM. TRANSPORTATION IN ADDITION TO DISPATCH WILL ELECTRIC GENERATION AND HEAVY AND HEAVY DUTY MANUFACTURING. THOSE AREAS OF THE ECONOMY WHERE THERE IS BROAD AGREEMENT THAT ELECTRIFICATION WILL BE CHALLENGING. THIS MEANS DECREASING DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS DIESEL AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS WHICH WOULD IN TURN REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND HELP ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S. HI MY GOALS. OUR PROPOSAL IN OUR PROPOSED RETENTION SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP TRANSITION LONG HAUL TRUCK FLEETS. AND THEN BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY AT THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. AND COULD YOU HAVE WELL DEVELOPED FULLY DISPLAYS UP TO THREE MILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL A DAY. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE AFTER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS OF SMOG FORMING KNOCKS POLLUTION- YEAR. AND REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS BY FOURTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO OAKLAND WHAT. MANDEL'S LAKE THE NATURAL EXTENSION OF SPOKE AGAINST THIS ROLE AS AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN HYDROGEN. AND WE COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED TO POTENTIALLY DEVELOP THE ANGELES LINK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU OUR CUSTOMS ONE HUNDRED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND OUR LAST SPEAKER IS JULIE MCNAMARA NOW WHO IS THE DEPUTY POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROGRAM AT THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS YEAR AND- I'M AT STATE. AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THERE IS CLEARLY A ROLL FOR HYDROGEN IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. AND THE SPECIFIC SET BACK ROLE ARE STILL FAR FROM CLEAR. THAT'S BECAUSE THE HYDROGEN CANCER A RANGE OF END USES A RANGE OF POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. IT DOES SO AT A COST AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO CAREFULLY INTERROGATE PROPOSALS FOR BRINGING LARGE SCALE HYDROGEN PROJECTS FORWARD BEFORE COMMITTING TO SUCH A PATH. DISCUSSION OF COURSE REQUIRES A CAREFUL BALANCE WE SHOULD BE FULLY EXPLORING THE SOLUTION SPACE WE SHOULD NOT BE PRECLUDING POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. THAT SAID. WE'RE ON A TIGHT TIME LINE WITH LIMITED BY ITS INVESTMENT APPLE WHICH MEANS IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO FULLY CONSIDER HOW ANY GIVEN SOLUTION MIGHT FIT INTO A LONG TERM TRANSITION PLAN. WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT FULLER PICTURE SOME SOLUTIONS WILL STAY IN THE RUNNING BUT SOME THINGS JUST FALL DOWN. AND WHEN IT COMES TO HYDROGEN IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTION PATHWAYS AND SOME END USE APPLICATIONS THAT JUST WON'T GET THE JOB DONE. SO TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER WHETHER AND HOW HYDROGEN FITS WITHIN THE ECONOMY WIDE TO CARBONIZATION PICTURE. IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING THREE KEY FACTORS PRODUCTION TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE AND END USE PRIORITIZATION. FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTION WE'VE HEARD IN SOME OF THESE EARLY PROJECT PRESENTATIONS CONSIDERATION OF CARBON INTENSITY. FROM THIS REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF CARBON EMISSIONS- HIGH- HYDROGEN PRODUCED BOB THIS HAS TO INCLUDE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE NOT JUST CONSIDERED THE POINT OF PRODUCTION. BECAUSE LETTING IGNORES CRITICAL INFORMATION THAT CAN GIVE A VERY MISLEADING PICTURE OF THE CARBON INTENSITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT JUST CONSIDER CARBON BUT ALSO COMPLETES. THE TRANSITION TO OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE HAS TO BE TRULY CLEAN NOT JUST DE CARBONIZED. FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTION METHODS IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER TIGHTENING AND RAMP RATES SPECIFICALLY HOW FAST AND TO WHAT DEGREE CAN BE GIVEN PRODUCTION PATHWAYS SKILLED TO MEET PROJECTED NEEDS. AND WILL THE VARIOUS PERFORMANCE LEVELS THAT ARE BEING PROJECTED SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF CARBON CAPTURE A BLUE HYDROGEN PROJECT MIGHT ACHIEVE ACTUALLY MEET THOSE TARGETS. WE COMBINE THESE QUESTIONS YOU START TO HAVE REAL REAL CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE PATHWAYS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO REALLY FULLY. CONSIDER THEM BEFORE TAKING A FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE STICK APPROACH. SECOND WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HYDROGEN LEAKS COME WITH IT. AND THERE'S INCREASING INFORMATION COMING OUT THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN TO SERVICES INDIRECT. GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION. THAT MEANS WE NEED FAR BETTER INFORMATION AND TRACKING ABOUT HYDROGEN LEAKAGE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY FURTHER IMPACT THE CARBON AT THE GLOBAL WARMING CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HYDROGEN MAY OR MAY NOT HELP DRIVE DOWN. BOB IT'S ALSO GREAT HYDROGEN HAS SOME INEFFICIENCIES AND STORAGE AND SPACE CONSTRAINTS- THE PILOT PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING ONLINE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WILL BE IMPORTANT TO COLLECT GRANULAR DATA ON AND TO FULLY CONSIDER WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE LINE. AND FINALLY IT COMES TO THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION AND USES. WE KNOW THE HYDROGEN HAS VALUE WE KNOW THAT IT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. BUT HE INEFFICIENCY OF ITS PRODUCTION METHOD MEANS THAT VALUE COMES AT THE COST. ESPECIALLY IN THE NEAR TERM WE SHOULD BE PLACING A LARGE PREMIUM ON THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION OF ITS USE. BECAUSE SUPPLIES WILL BE LIMITED WE SHOULD BE DIRECTING HYDROGEN TO WHERE THERE IS GREATEST VALUE. AND THAT INCLUDES CONSIDERING WHERE THERE WILL BE STEALING OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE THERE WILL BE DENNIS. SO EVEN THOUGH HYDROGEN CAN PLAY A ROLE IN EVERY SECTOR. AT AT POSSIBLY. YOU KNOW ACT COST ANY GIVEN SKILL IT SHOULD NOT AND THERE WILL BE REAL COSTS WERE WE TO COMMIT TO SUCH A WIDE SCALE USE ELECTRIFIED WE ALWAYS SHOULD BECAUSE THE EFFICIENCY GAINS WILL HELP US DISPLACE FOSSIL FUELS FASTER. SO WE SHOULD ALWAYS CONSIDER HYDROGEN I TESTING SECTORAL CONSIDERATIONS WITH IN OUR BROADER ECONOMY WIDE ASSESSMENT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW NEARER EVALUATIONS OF WHERE HYDROGEN MANY OR MAY NOT PLAY A ROLE IN A GIVEN SECTOR HOW THAT ALIGNS WITH THE BIGGER PICTURE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OTHER AND USES FOR HYDROGEN MIGHT BE USED. INSTEAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT WAS OUR LAST PANELISTS I'D LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I WAS FOLLOWING THE FIRST PANEL. BY BROADCAST AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS VERY IMPORTANT TO A HEARING. I FIRST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE MR NAVIN WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. IF HE IS AVAILABLE GO AHEAD AND ASK IF THEY'LL POP THEM OUT HERE TAUGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT- SO MISTER NAV AND YOU. DESCRIBE THE- WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A VERY EXCITING NEW PROJECT ANGELES LINK POTENTIALLY THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF GREEN HYDRATION AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE- HELLO B. WELL COULD YOU TALK MORE ABOUT HOW- BASICALLY THAT THE THAT THAT GREEN HYDRATION- WOULD DO A WEE BIT WOULD BE PRODUCED. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THAT GREEN HYDROGEN WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM A CURTAILED. AND NEW BUILD- RENEWABLE ENERGY SO THAT'S SIMILAR TRADITIONAL RENEWABLES. WHAT SOURCED FROM AREAS OF HIGH OTHER HIGH SOLAR IRRADIANCE OR A HIGH WIND WITHIN THE STATE SO THOSE AREAS. OF THE STATE. THAT TOWARD ARE CURRENTLY- PROVIDE A SIGNAL AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY SO WOULD LOOK TO OUR BOB AND NEW BEEN BUILT SOLAR AND WIND TO PRODUCE GREEN HYDROGEN AND MOVE THE MOVE THAT HYDROGEN. INTO THE LOS ANGELES BASIN WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OFFTAKE POTENTIAL INCLUDING- THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. DISPATCHABLE ELECTRIC GENERATION BUT ALSO HEAVY DUTY- TRANSPORTATION THAT COMES IN AND OUT OF THE PORT THAT'S CURRENTLY FUELED BY LARGELY DIESEL TRUCKS FUEL CELL VEHICLES FOR THOSE LONGER HAUL ROCKS. UP AND THAT ALSO TO- A HEAVY DUTYINDUSTRY MANUFACTURING THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WITHIN THE BASIN WELL THAT WELL AT SOME POINT NEED TO DECARBONISE. ABOUT MAY NEED- SO EVEN THOUGH YOU REPRESENT THE GAS COMPANY. YOU'RE ENVISIONING THEY THE PROPOSAL FOR THE ANGELES LANG DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY USE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN. WELL THAT'S CURRENT IN THE INTENT OF THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY TO SOURCE OUR GREEN HYDROGEN SO HYDROGEN FROM OUR- EXISTING RENEWABLES NEWBUILD RENEWABLES AND TO BRING THAT HYDROGEN INTO THE PREVIOUS AND- SOME ALTERNATELY THE END EFFECT WOULD BE TO DISPLACE- EXISTING NATURAL GAS. USE WITHIN THE BASE. WHAT IS YOUR- PROPOSED TIME LINE IN TERMS OF BRING IN THIS ANGELES FLANK. ONLINE AND- WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU- THE MAJOR OBSTACLES THEY USE AND FOR C. N. N. GETTING THIS UP AND RUNNING. CERTAINLY WE- NUMBER OF WEEKS AGO SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO THE CQC OR MINIMAL CAL ESSENTIALLY AN ACCOUNT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO. START THE PLANNING PROCESS. AND THIS WOULD BE A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT WOULD LOOK TO INCLUDE- LEGISLATORS REGULATORS- THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. UP TO. LOOK AT THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE APPLICATION OF GREEN HYDROGEN WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES BASED. SO WE WOULD PROPOSE A MULTI PHASE PROCESS TO MOSCOW AND- AND ROUTE THE PIPELINE AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GOES WITH IT LOOKING AT THE OFF TAKERS- ENVIRONMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PRODUCERS AS WELL. SO WE LOOK AT A PHASED APPROACH TO SCOPING AND THEN ULTIMATELY ONCE THE SCOPING WAS COMPLETE WE'VE LEFT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE APPLY TO- TO BUILD UP THE FACILITIES. SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE P. YOU SEE HERE ARE YOU ARE YOU BASICALLY. PROPOSING THAT RATEPAYERS PAY FOR THIS ANGELES FLANK. HELLO NOT WORD. AT THE MOMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT SCOPING THE PROJECT- AND THEN WE WOULD LOOK TO. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE LOOK AT THE- OF THE ENTITIES THAT DERIVE THE BENEFIT FROM THE- OUR PLANET FOR STRUCTURE AND ULTIMATELY THE COST WOULD ACCRUE TO THOSE- ENTITIES ULTIMATELY THOUGH THAT. WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE EIGHT EIGHT NUMBER TO DETERMINE RATES SOMETHING FROM US BECAUSE INITIAL. COULD YOU IDENTIFY THE MAIN CATEGORIES OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE PAYING FOR THIS WHAT ANGELES LINK. ONE ONE COULD ENVISION- DISPATCHABLE POWER GENERATION IF YOU DO THE INDUSTRY AND. THEN THE ONLY- ATTENTIONS. ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PANELISTS SO I'LL ASK A WHILE YOU'RE ON THE SCREEN I THINK I WILL ASK YOU- YOU MENTIONED SOURCING THE GREEN HYDROGEN I WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR WHETHER YOU'RE PRODUCING IT OR WHETHER YOU'RE PURCHASING IT AND BRING IT IN. WE CERTAINLY A SECOND GAS- WOULD- YOURSELVES LARGELY AS- A CONNECTION BETWEEN. PRODUCTION AND- AND USERS SO WE WOULD NOT UNTO OURSELVES I'M SUGGEST THAT WE WOULD REDUCE THE GRADUATION SO WE CAN BE SOURCING. THE HYDROGEN FROM THE DEVELOPERS THAT WOULD LOVE TO. EITHER INCLUDE DIVERSION AS PART OF THEIR EXISTING. RENEWABLES GENERATION. IN INDOOR. THE NEW BUILT CONSTRUCTION SO WE UNTIL OURSELVES WOULD NOT BE A PRODUCING HYDROGEN THE MIST THANK YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED A VARIETY OF END USES- YOU MENTIONED HEAVY INDUSTRY YOU MENTIONED TRANSPORTATION I THINK TRANSPORTATION FUEL. BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS CONCEPT OF YOU YOU ALSO MENTION THOUGH BRINGING INTO HOMES SO DOES THAT IS THAT STILL THE IDEA THAT YOU BLEND IT WITH NATURAL GAS THEN AND REDUCE THE NATURAL GAS USE BY 7% OR SOMETHING OR IS THIS A TWO DIFFERENT IDEA FOR. SO ANGELES LINK ITSELF WOULD NOT THOSE THOSE MOLECULES WOULD NOT BE USED FOR HOMES WHAT WILL LIKELY HAVE A PARALLEL EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE VIABILITY OF. A BLENDING IS I THINK ONE OF THEM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MENTIONED BUT THE ANGELES LINK ITSELF IS INTENDED TO BE A- GREEN HYDROGEN I FLYING. IT WOULD SERVE THE HARD TO ELECTRIFY SOME SECTORS OF THE LOS ANGELES REGION SO IT'S A PHYSICAL PIPELINE THAT THEN YOU SOURCE HYDROGEN. AND YOU BRING UP THE PIPELINE INTO LOS ANGELES AND THEN YOU BECOME A DISTRIBUTION CENTER. FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT AND USES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SET THE IDEA LOW YES CURRENT MANAGER YES GOT IT THANK YOU NOW THAT'S AYE. AYE IT'S IT IT IS VERY INTERESTING. I'M LET ME GO BACK COULD I FOLLOW- JUST. LET ME FINISH THE QUESTIONS WE CAN ASK WHOEVER YOU YOU WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS TO. YEAH THAT'S OKAY MISTER LEVIN WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE QUESTION OF ME WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU WANTED US TO ASK YOU- REGARDING THE HYDROGEN HUBS YES. CHAIR FRIEDMAN- SO FIRST OF ALL WE'RE VERY GRATIFIED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY REALLY STEPPING THROUGH FORWARD WITH. A VERY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM. TO INCREASE THE SCALE IN PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN- THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS TO THAT PROGRAM ONE IS PRODUCTION. THE OTHERS DISTRIBUTION IN THE THIRD IS OFF OFFTAKE WHERE IS THAT HYDROGEN GOING TO GO. UP THE SPEAKER FROM THE UCS. UCS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT. HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND THE WHOLE MANAGEMENT OF HYDROGEN IN ORDER TO ENSURE A CLEAN SOURCE. AND SO THAT HAS TO BE A FACTOR THAT HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED VERY STRONGLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OUR STATE HAS BEEN A LEADER IN MOVING THIS TECHNOLOGY FORWARD AND I SPOKE OF ONE OF THE PROJECTS WERE INVOLVED IN. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS AS WELL. WE ARE IN THE BEST POSITION. TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE COST SHARE. AND LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING MY GUESS IS FROM WHAT WE BURDEN- YOUR WORKSHOPS. IS THERE. THEIR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. A TO INCREASE THE SCALE OF RODUCTION. UP BUT IN ORDER TO MATCH THAT WE NEED. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE OR SIGNIFICANT OFFTAKE. AND I THINK CALIFORNIA IS IN A VERY GOOD POSITION. TO COST SHARE THAT OFFTAKE PORTION OF IT WE'RE VERY FAR ADVANCED MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. IN SOME CASES INTERNATIONALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR UTILIZING HYDROGEN FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO I WOULD HOPE THE CALIFORNIA IN ITS STRATEGY TO BE ONE OF THE HUBS AND I IT WELL THE INITIAL LEGISLATION TALKED ABOUT FOUR HUBS AT ROUGHLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS PER HUB. THE LATEST DISCUSSIONS IN THE WORKSHOPS WITH DEAL WE IS SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN TEN HOBBS THAT COULD BE FUNDED UPWARDS OF A HALF A BILLION TO A BILLION DOLLARS AT 50% COST SHARE. SO THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS CALIFORNIA IS IN A VERY GOOD POSITION TO THE PROPERTY COST SHARE THAT. BUT IN DOING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S OFF TAKE FOR THAT FUEL AND WE ARE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION. TO EXPAND SUCH AS THE PROJECT I SPOKE OF EARLIER. OF THIRTY TRUCKS TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED TRUCKS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT OFF TAKE AND MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON CRITERIA MISSIONS ON PORCH IN THE LIGHT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA LOOKING AT WAYS TO LEVERAGE ITS RESOURCES. TO GO AFTER THE FEDERAL FUNDING I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD AND CAN BE ONE OF THOSE HUBS THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT THERE IS NOT A LARGE NETWORK OF PIPELINES THAT IS. CLEARLY ONE OF THE POTENTIAL POTENTIALLY CHEAPEST WAYS OF MOVING HYDROGEN. SO WITHOUT THAT PIPELINE WHICH DOES EXIST IN MUCH GREATER. NUMBERS IN TEXAS OKLAHOMA IN THE STATES ARE PRIMARILY ARE REFINED REORIENTED WE NEED TO MOVE IT WITH TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSPORTATION. DOES COST CRITERIA MISSIONS WHEN YOU TRANSPORT BY TRUCK. BUT HERE WE NOW HAVE FUEL CELL TRUCKS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN MOVE THAT FUEL. WITH ZERO EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF IT SO THAT'S ANOTHER COMPONENT OF IT THAT I THINK WE CAN LEAD THE WAY IN DOING THAT. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OF MS MCNAMARA- YOU MENTIONED. THE NECESSITY FOR US TO EVALUATE EMISSIONS NOT JUST OUT PRODUCTION BUT THROUGH THE WHOLE A CHAIN OF USE OF HYDROGEN AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS GIVEN THAT IT'S A ZERO EMISSION FUEL WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT EXACTLY. WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE MISSED EMISSIONS DOWN THE ROAD THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF. SURE SO. WHEN WE THINK OF HYDROGEN'S USE ADS IN A FUEL CELL VEHICLE FOR EXAMPLE YOU WON'T HAVE THE MISSIONS ARE RIGHT FROM THE TAIL PIPE ONLY WATER. FOUND BUT WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO HOW THAT HYDROGEN IS PRODUCED YOU COULD HAVE ELECTROLYTIC DRIVEN FULLY BY RENEWABLE SIR USING CLEAN ELECTRICITY TO SPLIT WATER AND THERE ARE NO EMISSIONS. FROM BUT THERE ARE ALSO DISCUSSIONS AS THE FIRST PRESENTATION MENTIONED OF USING NATURAL GAS FOR EXAMPLE STEAM METHANE REFORMING THE PRIMARY METHOD OF PRODUCING. HYDROGEN TODAY RIGHT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION AND YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LEADER DOWN DOWNSTREAM I THINK I MAY HAVE MISSED. IT YES I DID MENTION IT YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT PRODUCTION THERE IS ALSO THE POTENTIAL. LEAKAGE OF HYDROGEN WHICH IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A DISCUSSION PAPER. AND GROWING STUDY- THE DEGREE TO WHICH HYDROGEN IS AN INDIRECT GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTANT AND SO IT'S ALL LEAKAGE CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE. TO GLOBAL WARMING MUCH LIKE NOTHING HAVE WE- HOW- RAPE OR THOSE STUDIES I MEAN DO WE HAVE ANY INDICATION OF HOW IT WOULD COMPARE FOR INSTANCE TO METHANE OR NATURAL GAS. WHEN IT THE IN ITS LEAKAGE PROFILE AND I'M I'M NOT SAYING WHETHER AT LEAST MORE I'M SAYING WHEN IT DOES WHAT'S THE COME WHAT'S THE SORT OF COMPARISON OF DAMAGE DONE AND IS IT A GREENHOUSE GAS. CONTRIBUTORS IT'S NOT BUT THE WAY IT FUNCTIONS AS AS AN INDIRECT POLLUTANT SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THOSE PATHWAYS DESPITE. I'M INTERFERING WITH THE MOLECULES THAT BREAKS DOWN METHANE SO MAKING EXISTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OR LONGER. THERE IS RESEARCH. AND SOME UNDERSTANDING ALREADY TODAY. OF HYDROGENS GENERAL HOWEVER THERE'S ONLY A MERGING RESEARCH NOW THAT STILL GOING THROUGH. PUBLICATION AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A FEW OUT BUT THEY'RE STILL. CERTAINLY UNDER DISCUSSION- ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT SHORTER TIMELINES. THE HOBBIT OUTSIZED EFFECT MUCH LIKE WE THINK OF MATTHEW RIGHT WE LOOK AT A SHORTER TIMELINE COMPARED TO CARBON DIOXIDE. IT HAS A HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL IF YOU% LOOK OVER THE LONGER PERIOD THIS IS LESS. I WOULD JUST REITERATE I THINK IT'S AN AREA OF IMPORTANT RESEARCH I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT AREA TO TRACK- THEM BUT. BUT BUT IT IS NOT SETTLED. OKAY YOU KNOW IT IT'S- I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY AWARE AS WE MOVE INTO THESE TECHNOLOGIES OF. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND OF ANY OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS- IT IS INTERESTING TO ME AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER THIS OR NOT THAT IT'S INTERESTING THAT HYDROGEN IS KIND OF GETTING SO MUCH SCRUTINY. WHEN AND AS SOMEONE WHO DEFINITELY SUPPORTS- EVEY TECHNOLOGY IN ELECTRIFICATION- YEAH I THINK THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LECTURE ELECTRIFICATION WHERE YOU HAVE A RENEWABLE SOURCE AND YOU'RE- PUTTING INTO YOUR GRID AND POWER IN YOUR HOME WITH IT. AND THE IMPACT THAT WE SEE FOR MINING FOR LITHIUM AND THINGS THAT POWER OF THIS THE KIND OF STATIC BATTERIES THAT GO INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ARE WE- YES WE NEED TO BE SKEPTICAL OR WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED BUT ARE WE PUTTING HYDROGEN THROUGH HOOPS THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING. ELECTRIC BATTERIES THROUGH- I YOU KNOW I JUST I'VE NEVER HEARD. YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALISTS COME IN RAISING SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT ELECTRIC CARS AS I SEEM TO BE HEARING ABOUT HYDROGEN AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THAT. SURE I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND YET I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. BOTH WHAT I CAN SAY IS WHERE ICS NOW STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANT ENERGY TRANSITION WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THAT MISSTEPS WE'VE MADE TO DATE THAT THINGS WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN AND DID NOT BEFORE WE COMMITTED TO PATHWAYS SUCH AS ARE FAR GREATER UNDERSTANDING NOW OF METHANE LEAKAGE FROM NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. AB ORDERED PROTECT THE CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS FROM COMBUSTION SOME FORMS OF FOSSIL FUELS COMPARED TO OTHERS WHEN WE TAKE THIS BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND WE LOOK AT THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION WE LOOK AT THE- BROADER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WE CAN SEE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT PATH THAN. BUT TODAY WE'RE STANDING HERE LOOKING AT THIS BROAD SUITE OF SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE TO US OR WE HAVE TIME ON THE LINE RIGHT WE KNOW WE WANT TO TAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE PATH. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE TRULY THINKING ABOUT ALL THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS BEFORE WE COMMIT TO POWER AGAIN I DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE START OF MY COMMENTS IT DIDN'T. TRY TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE PARALYZED BY THESE CONCERNS WE HAVE TO KEEP THE SUITE OF SOLUTIONS OPEN BUT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT WITH A NARROW MINDSET WHERE WE WHERE WE GET MORE WHAT COULD REALLY HELPED SHAPE A BETTER PASSWORD. YEAH AND YOU ALSO MADE THE POINT I THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD POINT THAT WE KNOW WHAT WHAT SECTORS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE AND FOCUSING ON THOSE WITH THIS RELATIVELY NEW TECHNOLOGY I MEAN MAYBE IT'S NOT RELATIVELY NEW BUT AT LEAST ARE SORT OF. COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACTS ARE STILL DEVELOPING THAT FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TOUGHER RATHER THAN THE ONES THAT. YOU KNOW OUR EASIER DEALT WITH WITH OTHER ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. MAYBE IS- CAN IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE THE FOLK AYE A- THAT PERSPECTIVE WELL- I WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT WHO I THINK HAS SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS REPRESENTATIVE AND THEN I'D LIKE TO COME BACK TO THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS TO REPRESENTATIVE. RATHER THAN A SWITCHING I'M HAPPY TO SWITCH MY ORDER QUESTIONS BUT WE LOVE THAT- IT WILL. I REALIZE THAT SHE'S ON THE SCREEN ALL RIGHT LET ME JUST WHICH MY ORDER QUESTIONS HERE AND IF- IF THAT'S OKAY- I APPRECIATE THE- QUESTION THAT- MADAM CHAIR- ASKED ABOUT- THE SCRUTINY IT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF HYDROGEN AND WAS GOING FORWARD- THE- N. I. I AGREE WITH YOU WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO- IDENTIFY WATER THE UNKNOWNS AS AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OF STRIVE COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ARE ONE ARE THE EUROPEANS WHO SEEM TO BE MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD ON HYDROGEN AND WE ARE ARE THEY IDENTIFYING HYDROGEN AS A- AS A YOU KNOW AS AN- ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM OR IS JUST IS JUST MOSTLY JUST BE BEING IDENTIFIED AS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE RESEARCH. BUT NOBODY'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW NOBODY THAT'S FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IS IDENTIFYING IT AS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- THIS IS A VERY ACTIVE POINT OF DISCUSSION IN EUROPE- AND IN FACT I WOULD- SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE PURSUING FAR MORE AMBITIOUS STANDARDS WHEN IT COMES TO THE CURRENT INTENSITY AND OVERALL- PRODUCTION PICTURE. AND ENTITIES PICTURE OF HYDROGEN- COMPARED TO WHERE WE ARE AT. THE NATIONAL LEVEL TODAY I WILL SAY THERE ARE SOME GOOD INITIATIVES NOW UNDERWAY. I'M HERE BUT I WOULD SAY WE'RE INTO CATCH UP MODE AND- WHAT WE CONSIDERED MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME UP AND I SPEAK ACROSS THE COUNTRY I DON'T SPEAK JUST TO CALIFORNIA. WE'VE SEEN OUR OWN LARGE BIASED TOWARDS NATURAL GAS BASED HYDROGEN SOLUTIONS. AND CALCULATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW HYDROGEN FROM THOSE FORMS HERE THAT WOULD NEVER PASS THE TEST IN EUROPE I'M SO DISAPPOINTED JUST WHEN WE THINK ABOUT TRADE THAT THEY WOULDN'T QUALIFY GREAT AS I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF PRODUCTION AS MADAME BETTER. IDENTIFIED IF IT'S THE QUESTION OF ARE YOU GOING TO PRODUCE IT WITH SOMETHING ELSE WITH A FOSSIL FUEL VERSUS IF YOU'RE A PRODUCER WITH RENEWABLES BUT WHAT IS NEW TO ME THAT I'M HEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME IS JUST THE ACTUAL PRODUCING OF HYDROGEN NO MATTER HOW YOU PRODUCE IF YOU PRODUCE IT WITH RENEWABLES THE IDEA THAT IT MIGHT LEAK AND MIGHT CAUSE A PROBLEM. AT LEAST AT THIS POINT TIME I WANT TO PUT IN THE CATEGORY OF THAT'S A RESEARCH POSSIBILITY BUT THERE'S NO. EVIDENCE OF THAT YET IS THAT CORRECT. HELLO WE'VE ALSO SEEN IT M. THE STATE AS A POTENTIAL SENSITIVITY TO INCLUDE IN SOME COUNTRIES ANALYSES OF THE- OF THE PICTURE THE OTHER. THE OTHER WAY I'D SAY THAT EUROPE HAS BEEN FULLY CONSIDERING HYDROGEN IS BY PURSUING THE STRATEGIC ROADMAPS THAT LOOK KIND OF THE WIDE AND THEN SECTOR BY SECTOR WITHIN SURE I STARTED TO BE HARD TO HEAR THIS EARLIER PRESENTATION THAT INCLUDED A CONSIDERATION OF THE BIGGER PICTURE OF HYDROGEN BECAUSE THAT HELPS GUIDE BEFORE COURSE GREAT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE AND I DON'T MEAN TO CATCH UP ON YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO. GET TO GET THROUGH ALL THE STUFF THAT HE IS THERE AN EQUAL CONCERN ON THE EASY SIDE ABOUT. IF IMAGINE IF WE HAVE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY AS WE ELECTRIFY VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING AS- NIKOL CONCERN ABOUT THE RECYCLING OF ALL THESE BATTERIES ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE MINING OF ALL THE RARE EARTH MINERALS- FOR THE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IS THAT ALSO. EQUALLY BEING A POINT OF CONCERNS AND SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAVE FURTHER RESEARCH I HEAR BROUGHT UP FOR HYDROGEN IN THIS HEARING I DON'T HEAR THAT BROUGHT UP- FOR THEBATTERY SIDE OF THIS ALSO. WE'RE SIT THIS IS A IN IMPORTANT POINT OF CONVERSATION AND YES THE SOURCING AS WELL AS THE END USE RECYCLING. OF MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE CLEAN ENERGY SUPPLY CHAIN FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO SOLAR PANELS THINKING ABOUT ALL THE FEES. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THAT THAT SUPPLY CHAIN CLEANER MORE DEFINITELY PERCEIVED THANK YOU AND DAN I APPRECIATE THAT WE ALL ARE WRESTLING WITH THIS QUESTION. AND I THINK I CAPTURED IT IN WHAT YOU SAID I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT AND THAT IS. WE HAVE THIS RACE AND THAT WE COULD WAIT TOO LONG. AND STUDY AND HAVE THE CLIMB IT GETS SO BAD THAT IT IT'S MAKES IT LESS MEANINGFUL WHAT CHANGES WE MAKE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE THERE'S WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. AND SO WE HAVE A TRADE OFF TO HOW INTENSELY. DO WE DO THE RESEARCH FOR SIS- YOU KNOW DOING SOMETHING AND THEN IF WE SEE A PROBLEM TRYING TO ADJUST FROM THERE SO THAT WE AT LEAST ADJUST. IT AM I CORRECT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RECOGNIZING THAT ALSO AND THAT'S WH YOU'RE SAYING FOCUSING ENERGY ON THE MOST VALUABLE USES OF SOMETHING LIKE HYDROGEN- SO THAT WE CAN GET MOVING. AND THEN TURN AROUND AND- CONTINUE TO DO THE RESEARCH AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM COME FROM THERE MY CORRECTOR. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISTER MAYOR CITY. THANK YOU I STAYING WITH THEM AS MCNAB ARE A- AND FOLLOWING MISTER BENNETT'S LINE OF QUESTIONS- I WAS AT A RECENT CONFERENCE WHERE- THE POTENTIAL FOR GREEN HYDROGEN NOT ONLY. AS A- TRANSPORTATION FUEL BUT ALSO AS A FORM OF ENERGY STORAGE WAS DISCUSSED GREG GOOD COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW THE- EFFECTIVENESS OF- GREEN HYDROGEN STORING. WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY. VERSES BATTERY STORAGE. THANK YOU I'M. HYDROGEN IS ARE LESS EFFICIENT A STORAGE MECHANISM THAT BATTERY STORAGE HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE STORED AND LARGE VOLUMES AND FOR LONG PERIODS WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT HYDROGEN AND BATTERIES WILL GO HEAD TO HEAD FOR THE SAME PURPOSE BUT IN THE POWER SECTOR BUT WE CAN IMAGINE PERHAPS FOR SEASONAL STORAGE WHERE WE HAVE LARGE PRODUCTIONS RIGHT IT IS SAFE FOR SOLAR- BUT WE HAVE. OVERPRODUCTION AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE YEAR ARE WE CAN TURN THAT INTO HYDROGEN AND STORING AND THEN USED IT DURING PERIODS WHEN WE MAY HAVE LESS RENEWABLE ABUNDANCE PROBLEM AND THAT STAGE JUST WITHIN THE POWER SECTOR. OR IT CAN BE BROUGHT AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY ACROSS OTHER SECTORS AS A WAY TO TAKE THAT CLEAN ELECTRICITY AND USABLE SQUARE. THANK YOU AND- IN IN TERMS OF- STATE INVESTMENTS ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE- IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT WAS SHARED FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE IS A SUMMARY OF A RECENT REPORT BY EARTH JUSTICE. THAT THAT FOCUSES ON YOU KNOW THE. THE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE SECTORS- LIKE LONG HAUL TRUCKS- BUT DISCOURAGING- INVESTMENTS- AND OR OR THE USE OF HYDROGEN OF FOUR FOUR CARS AND BUSES- IT WOULDN'T WHICH YOU CAN CURRENT THAT AND IF SO. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST LIMITED RESOURCES INTO- HYDROGENFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CARS AND BUSES. YEAH THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION ALLEN WE DON'T WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS SOME ROLE ACROSS ALL THESE END USES ACROSS CARS AND BUSES REGIONAL TRUCKS AND SAID HERE. AB BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE READILY AVAILABLE I HAVE DIRECT ELECTRIFICATION ALTERNATIVES TODAY THAT ARE RAMPING WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED AND COST EFFECTIVENESS SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. HOW TO PURSUE THE FORWARD COURSE WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING PRECLUDING THESE AS AS VIABLE TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT INVESTMENTS SHOULD BE STALLED ON BEHALF. RIGHT JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO CATCH UP. I'M WE THINK LIKELY MOST OF THESE WILL BE DISH APPLICATIONS THAT IT WILL BE A VERY SMALL SHARE VEHICLES THAT WILL BE LIKE TO BE A COSTS THAT WILL BE NITROGEN BUT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERAL- AND SO JUST THINKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN LINE WITH THAT BALANCING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OKAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE NOW TO PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE WE DO I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR PANELISTS FROM BOTH PANELS WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SHARING YOUR TIME AND YOUR EXPERTISE AND I CAN TELL BY THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT YOU SHARED A LOT OF VERY RELEVANT AND VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION WITH US SO THANK YOU ALL. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE PUBLIC WILL START FIRST WITH THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES APIECE WHICH IS A 100% MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE NORMALLY GIVE TO PARTICIPANTS SO TWO MINUTES EACH AND I ACTUALLY I THINK YOU. STAYS BACK THERE RIGHT WE'RE THAT'S OKAY YOU'RE THERE GO FOR IT I THINK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE TWO MINUTES IN A- TIMELY COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY THERESA COOK I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT- MANUFACTURERS SPANNING FROM LIGHT DUTY TO HEAVY DUTY WE ALSO REPRESENT. I 80% OF THE LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET AND 1100% OF THE HEAVY DUTY- HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET AS WELL AS MAJOR HYDROGEN PRODUCERS- A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT AMOUNTS AROUND A LOT SO I'M NUMBER ONE I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP TO THE DISCUSSION AROUND HYDROGEN LEAKAGE BY SHARING A QUOTE THAT COMES FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL- QUOTING A HYDROGEN LEAK OR SPILL WILL NOT CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT OR THREATEN THE HEALTH OF HUMANS OR WILDLIFE BUT FOSSIL FUELS COMPOSED SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND ECOLOGICAL THREATS WHEN LEAKED. SPILLED COMBUSTED THE EUROPEAN CAN COMMISSION EUROPEAN UNION HAS DONE AN ANALYSIS ON LEAKAGE RATES AND SHOWS THAT IT IS NEGLIGIBLE AND I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT HYDROGEN IS NOT A GREENHOUSE GAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT SU CHI YOU ASKED WONDERFUL QUESTIONS I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FIVE BY FIVE ANALISIS WHICH WAS DONE. AROUND THEIR. FLEET OF NATURAL GAS US- DIESEL BATTERY AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE BUSES WHAT WE'RE MISSING IN THE DISCUSSION IS PERFORMANCE THAT SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE SACRIFICED WHETHER YOU'RE TRANSIT DISTRICT OR WHETHER YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT- SO. ARE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS MY PAL- I LEFT BUT- WE WERE CHATTING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INCENTIVIZING PRODUCTION AND MAXIMIZING HOBBS WITH THE IG ME LEVIN. AND I WANTED TO UNDERSCORE EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID BUT REALLY BRING IT BACK TO SUPPORT FOR AND YOU SAYS WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY BUT WE NEED TO BE SUPPORTING AND YOU SAYS SO THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO FINISH LIGHT MEDIUM DUTY FUELING NETWORK. BUT I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT 62% OF THE TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR IS I'VE INFRASTRUCTURE. IS DEDICATED TO HEAVY DUTY SO I'D LIKE TO SEE LESS THAN THREE PERCENT. OF DOLLARS DIRECTED TOWARDS HYDROGEN WHICH IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW INTERCEPT SPENDING AND I FEEL LIKE THAT BUT AS IT WAS MEANT FOR ME IT WAS A- OKAY- SO WHAT'S- ONE CLOSING. COMMENT IF I MAY. A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY AROUND EFFICIENCY AND IT BEGS THE QUESTION EFFICIENT FOR HILL EFFICIENT FOR THE TRANSIT DISTRICT THAT NEEDS TO HAVE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS. EFFICIENT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THAT NEEDS TO HAVE IS YOUR MACHINE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TAKE THEM WHERE THEY NEED TO GO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IT THE END USES THE END GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO TRANSITION FOLKS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THERE'S NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO ARTIFICIALLY LIMIT THOSE AND USES. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I ONLY GIVE YOU MORE TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR DOZENS OF COMPANIES SO I SORT OF ADDED THEM UP. BUT NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO GET THAT SO YOU'RE LISTENING IT WAS THE LAST ONE SO NEXT A SPEAKER PLEASE MCHALE'S GROWTH WALKER PARA BEHALF OF LINDE PLC- WE REPRESENT- EVERY ASPECT OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION VALUE CHAIN- FROM PRODUCTION TO THE REFILLING. STATION INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING A LARGE PORTION OF THE LIQUEFACTION- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND NATIONALLY- EARLY WE JUST RECENTLY ONE ELECTROLYZER WARD FROM THE C. C. AND WEBER VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE'VE ALSO- DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BIO GAS TO REFORM THAT TO- RENEWABLE HYDROGEN FOR THE DELIVERY TO THE VEHICLE SPACE TODAY THAT THAT IS A- LOT LOWER THAN ELECTRICITY. CARBON PATHWAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE BECAUSE OF CARBON- THE HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF. MISSIONS LIKE METHANE BUT ALSO THERE'S OTHER INTERESTING PATHWAY SUCH AS BIOMASS. WHICH COULD HELP MITIGATE OUR WILDFIRE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE WANNA URGES THAT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON THE RENEWAL PATHWAYS JUST AS WE DO IN THE L. IN THE R. P. S. TO CONTINUE TO DECARBONISE HYDROGEN GOING FORWARD- SECOND. THE NUMBERS A LOT NUMBERS BEING THROWN AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING IN WARNING ABOUT COST. JUST WANNA LEAVE THIS WITH YOU. HYDROGEN ALSO TODAY IN A LIGHT DUTY STATION AND WE EXPECT BIG GREATER SPEED AT THE HEAVY DUTY STATIONS COMING FORWARD. IS FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE THEORETICAL ONE MEGAWATT CHARGER- THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE HEAVY DUTY CHARGING SPACE. LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN VEHICLES RECEIVED A FOUR MEGAWATT CHARGE ON EQUIVALENT BASIS. AND WITH THE STATE REBATE. WE ARE DELIVERING TEN TIMES THE ENERGY TRANSFER AT 5% OF THE STATE REMAKE COST. PER KILOWATT. WE'RE JUST GETTING PERFECTION AND- TESTING THESE EQUIPMENT TODAY FIFTY IS NOT ENOUGH TO CHIEF. KIND OF PROFICIENCY WORK WORK GET URGENT A CONTINUED INVEST IN THE SPACE. BUT ALSO WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT FOR THAT WE DO THE SPACE IS A SPACE WHERE HYDROGEN WILL ABSOLUTELY. DOMINATE AND BRING ZERO MISSION TO IT YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED BY PORT TRAFFIC. AND UP AND DOWN OR TRANSPORTATION INFREQUENT OURS WITHOUT SACRIFICING WEIGHT. VMT MATTERS EFFICIENCY FREIGHT MOVEMENT MATTERS. THAT THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF EFFICIENCY AZAR IS ALSO PRODUCTIVITY WE MUST MAINTAIN PRODUCTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN THIS COMMERCIAL PACES. SO TO THAT END- WE'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH SOME SOME MORE MATH SO YOU GUYS CAN SEE THE NUMBERS BUT- THE PREVIOUS TIME. THANK YOU AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN THE ROOM TO TESTIFY SO WE'D LIKE TO MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES PLEASE IF. THE OPERATOR- COMMITTEE OPEN UP THE- FOR ANY- TESTIMONY REMOTELY. THANK YOU FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S ONE IN THE VIDEO FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE SIXTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONLINE SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY YOU'RE BREAKING UP ON A SIR. THIS TIME WITH ART. YOU I'M ABOUT MEDICARE. YEAH MAYBE SIR IF YOU CAN HANG UP AND DIAL BACK WE CAN'T HEAR YOU AT ALL SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ANOTHER- COLOR BUT PLEASE DO CALL BACK OR SEND THIS TESTIMONY THROUGH OUR WEBSITE. OKAY NEXT CALLER PLEASE UP BY EIGHTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONE EIGHTY TWO I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT SAMA TESTIMONY IS EXTENDED WHILE OTHER TESTIMONY TENDS TO BE CURTAILED. THAT BEING SAID READING FROM A FORBES ARTICLE ABOUT WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT HYDROGEN. ON THE SURFACE HYDROGEN SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL FUEL. TO WATER WHICH IS HARDLY GOING TO DESTROY THE ATMOSPHERE WHAT REALLY WHAT REALLY APPEALS TO PEOPLE IS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN REFUEL HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLE AND THE SAME KIND OF WAY OF THE FOSSIL FUEL CAR. NO LIFESTYLE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY YOUR CAR WILL HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENGINE INSIDE BUT UNLESS YOU ENJOY TINKERING WITH ITS MECHANICALS YOU WON'T NOTICE FROM DAY TODAY YOU CAN JUST HEAD TO A FUEL STATION WHEN YOU NEED. A FIVE MINUTE POP UP JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS HYDROGEN'S INHERENT FLAW THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS CONVENIENCE HIDES A SIGNIFICANT FLAW IN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS SOMEHOW FAILED. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MARKETING PROPAGANDA OF HYDROGEN AND VANGELIS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE WIDELY UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE MESSAGES EITHER THE FILE IS BASICALLY BECAUSE BUT A LOT OF PHYSICS. FOR HYDROGEN TO BE COMPLETELY GREEN AND MUST BE PRODUCED BY ELECTROLYTE AND WATER WHICH SPLITS THIS INTO THE H. TWO AND O. THAT IS MADE OF. YOU CAN PRODUCE H. TWO FROM COPPELL FUEL YOU USUALLY METHANE BUT THIS CREATES EITHER GRAY HYDROGEN WHICH STILL PRODUCES A LOT OF CO TWO OR BLUE HYDROGEN WHICH CAPTURES 90% OF THE CO TWO AND STORE THAT MERELY DELAYING THE PROBLEM. ONLY ELECTROLYTES ZING HYDROGEN FROM WATER USUALLY USING ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES MAKES THE FEEL ENTIRELY GREEN. THIS IS AN INEFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT WASTES ENERGY AND I COULD GO ON AND ON EVEN AS THE COLLAPSE SUPERMAJORITY DIDN'T SUSPEND THE GAS TAX TODAY. AND YOU PEOPLE ARE SETTING UP THEIR PONTIFICATE YOUR TIME IS UP OPERATOR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU THAT A COMPROMISED SEVENTY TWO YEAR LINES OPEN. I GET AFTERNOON THANK TURN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JANE JORDAN WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT CALIFORNIA'S IN HYDROGEN WE WANTED TO- THAT THAT INVESTMENT IS EXCLUSIVELY IN HYDROGEN DRIVE FROM WIND OR SOLAR ENERGY. IN PARTICULAR WHERE WE URGE CALIFORNIA TO AVOID INVESTING IN HYDROGEN DERIVED FROM DAIRY BIOMETHANE THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF THIS PRODUCTION RESULTS AND DEMONSTRATED HARMFUL IMPACTS ON LOCALIZED AIR AND WATER QUALITY PRIMARILY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. JERRY BIOMETHANE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE INCLUDING IN THE HYDROGEN THIS SESSION AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A CLEAN SOURCE FOR FUEL WHEN SURELY CLEAN OUT THE ALTERNATIVES EXIST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER. GIVE IT A COMPROMISED EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRS AND MEMBERS REMEMBER PROVIDER ON BEHALF OF UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN WAS FOUNDED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND IS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA AND IS BUILDING A CARBON FREE FUTURE FOR AVIATION AND BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CARBON EMISSION AVIATION IS ACHIEVABLE WITHIN THAT DECADE. UNIVERSAL HOW YOU'RE GONNA CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE PLANES TO FLY USING HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS INSTEAD OF TRADITIONAL JET FUEL. AND YOU MAY BE AWARE AVIATION IS ONE OF THE HARDEST SECTORS TO DECARBONISE IN ADDITION TO WORKING ON THE POWER TRAIN THAT CAN CONVERT HYDROGEN FUEL ELECTRICITY UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN IS ALSO DEVELOPING DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE MODULAR CAPITAL TO TRANSPORT GREEN HYDROGEN FROM PRODUCTION SITES TO AIRPORT USING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO ONE OF THE HURDLES RAISING THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR HOW TO GET THE HYDROGEN TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED YOU CAPITAL WILL NOT BE LIMITED TO AVIATION AND COULD BE USED IN LOTS OF OTHER APPLICATIONS INCLUDING PASSENGER AND HEAVY HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. RAIL FERRIES AND AMONG OTHERS REGARDING GREEN HYDROGEN AS YOU HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER HOOK SHIELD THE COST TO BRING HYDROGEN ITS POTENTIALLY MORE THAN GRAY OR BLUE HYDROGEN. UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN IS COMMITTING TO USING GREEN HYDROGEN BUT TO MAKE THAT FEASIBLE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE PRODUCTION AND THE COST OF GREEN HYDROGEN MUST COME DOWN IF THE STATE IS COMMITTED TO GREEN HYDROGEN OVER OTHER TYPES OF HYDROGEN THEY NEED TO BE INCENTIVES OR SUBSIDIES TO REDUCE THE COST. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRIVATE PUBLIC COMMENT THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AT THE DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY AROUND THAT THE HYDROGEN HUB CONTINUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU I COME LINE. FIVE VELITE IS OPEN. I MY NAME IS SARAH AND I'M FROM THE- HYDROGEN BUSINESS CAN. THE TALKING YOUR BUSINESS COUNCIL AND TRANSPOSITION ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE NUMBERS THAT OUR WAR ALL WORKING TO COMMERCIALIZE THE HYDROGEN AND ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION BASIS- I THOUGHT SITTING IN THE CHAIR MEMBERS FOR HOLDING THAT'S- GREAT INFORMATIONAL SESSION. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO START MY COMMENTS BY SECONDING EVERYTHING THAT A TREE TO COOK FROM THE TOP AND HYGIENE COALITION HAD STATED PREVIOUSLY- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE STATEMENTS. BUT IN ADDITION I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- SOME COMMENTS MADE BY THE CORPORATE FINANCE. ADVOCATING FOR THE CARBON INTENSITY SCALE IN ALL ASPECTS OF GETTING TOWARD DECARBONIZATION GOALS- THIS IS BC IS. THRILLED WITH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN THE FACT IT DOES USE THE CARBON INTENSITY SCALE REALLY GET THE METRICS OF HOW TO RETURN THE HARMONIZATION GOALS- WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT METHOD GOING FORWARD WITH ALL EXPANSION OF HYDROGEN ELIGIBILITY. FURTHER WE REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW A HUGE DISCUSSION FOR HYDROGEN HEAVY DUTY WE HAVE SO MANY HAVING TO REMEMBER THE WE SUPPORT AS WELL HOW DID YOU END UP AT THE STATE. AMENITY SECTOR BUT ALSO THE STATE LIKE ANY FACTOR WE REALLY CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE CARDS THAT ARE PLUGGING INTO THE GRID BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE DO PLUGINS. ARE CUTTING INTEGRATED IS ON AVERAGE ABOUT 33% RENEWABLE WHEREAS ALL OF THE STATIONS THAT ARE PART OF LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD BESIDES. SEVEN OR EIGHT ARE IN OPERATION SO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS ARE ABOUT 90% RENEWABLE ARE HIGHER AND I THINK OF THE BABY REPORT THAT WAS PRODUCED FROM CARD ITSELF. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND. THIS LARGE CONFERENCE FOR. ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT'S HARD. ON A GRID THAT UP STATION. THAT ARE MATURE NINETY PER MIDDLE OR HIGH. WHAT KIND OF A WINNER LOSER HERE WE JUST JERRY AND- YOUR TO PARITY IN ADDRESSING THAT THE IS THE AND- HOW TO RELATE TO GETTING RIGHT INFO. FOR YOUR MUCH VEHICLES. ARE GOING FOR. WHICH IS REALLY A HER. CLICK TELL YOU DISCUSSION AND NOT TO ONE OR THE THERE'S LIKE HEALTH CAN'T ABOUT THREE FOURTHS. THIRTY CREDIT. THANK YOU YOUR TIME IS. UP NEXT CALLER PLEASE. GET A COMPROMISE SEVENTY YEAR IS OPEN. MMHM GOOD EVENING GOOD AFTERNOON OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND CHAIR- MY NAME IS STEVE ROSENBLOOM ON A RESIDENT OF PALO ALTO AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AN INTERESTING PROCESS THOSE SORT OF INTERESTING PRESENTATIONS ON. HYDROGEN AND IN OUR- FUTURE ECONOMY- I'D LIKE TO REFOCUS YOUR ATTENTION BACK ON THE PRODUCTION AND THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL BY CHAIR HOPE SHE'LL. AND MISTER SIEGEL OF CARBON- AS WE ARE CHAIR HOPE YOU POINTED OUT THE CHEAPEST HYDROGEN IS MADE BY STEAM REFORMING OF METHANE. BUT THAT HAS A VERY HIGH CARBON INTENSITY AND I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS THE PRODUCTION END OF THE PROCESS ON CARBON INTENSITY AS THE S THE- MAIN QUALIFICATION BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO GET THE ZERO CARBON. NOW WE WANT TO SAVE OUR CLIMATE THAT HAS TO BE THE KEY METRIC- IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS I HAVE THERE'S A LOT OF DATA ON THIS BUT- IT'S NOT AND YOU KNOW DO NOT DOWN TO THE SINGLE DIGT ACCURACY BUT- IF YOU LOOK AT THE KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT PER KILOGRAM OF HYDROGEN PRODUCED. IN REFORMING OF METHANE PRODUCES ABOUT TWELVE KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT. STEAM REFORMING WITH CARBON CAPTURE IS IN THERE TWO TO THREE KILOGRAM RANGE AND- PRODUCTION BY ELECTROLYSIS OF WATER IS IN APPROXIMATELY THE ONE OR LESS KILOGRAM. ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT RANGE. SO WE IN ORDER TO GET. TO THE LOWEST POSSIBLE CARBON EMISSION WE REALLY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE. ON ON THE ELECTROLYSIS END OF THE SPECTRUM FOR ALL ALL NEW INVESTMENTS. AND I THINK THAT HAS TO BE THE KEY THE KEY QUALIFIER. AND I THINK AS CHAIR FRIEDMAN ALLUDED TO. IT DURING THE PRODUCTION PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THAT WHAT WE CALL SCOPES ONE AND TWO. OF THE- CARBON EMISSIONS PROCESS- THAT THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE MISSIONS OCCUR BUT IN SCOPE THREE WHERE THE END USER USES THAT THERE COULD ALSO BE INVOLVED. SO IT'S UNIQUE BUT I REJECT WHICH NEED TO BE CONSIDERED THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH- NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU THAT ARE FROM NINE SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR LINE IS- OPEN PLEASE AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON JULIA LEVINS WITH A VIOLENT OR TO YOUR SITUATION A CALIFORNIA I WANT TO THANK BOTH COMMITTEES. FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING HOW BEEN REALLY INFORMATIVE AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA- TO TACKLE THE ROLE OF HYDROGEN IN DECARBONIZING OUR ENERGY FACTOR. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE COMMENTS MADE BY MCNAMARA FROM THE CONCERNED HIGH HAS. AIRPORT REPRESENTED AND SEVERAL OTHERS THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE CALIFORNIA LOOK AT GREEN HYDROGEN OVER RENEWABLE HYDROGEN LIFE CYCLE BASIS. NOT JUST LOOK AT THE EMISSIONS FROM ONE PART OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS BUT- THE ENTIRE WELL TO WHEELS WELL TO. WHATEVER THAT'S THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE BASIS. AND I THINK- THE REASON THIS IS IMPORTANT WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE AIRPORT PRESENTATION THE AIRPORT FLIGHT NUMBER FOUR I REALLY URGE ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE OTHER LISTENERS. TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT FIVE NUMBER FORCING AIR RESOURCES BOARD WHICH WHICH SHOWS A VERY WIDE RANGE OF LIFE CYCLE CARBON INTENSITY FOR DIFFERENT SOURCES. IT ALSO UNDERSCORES THAT THE ONLY FORM OF HYDROGEN THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE CARBON NEGATIVE. HYDROGEN THAT IS GENERATED FROM ORGANIC WASTE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT THAT CAN HELP TO REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS- THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED BY LANDFILLS OR BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS IT WOULD EITHER BY OTHERWISE BE RELEASED ON THE OPEN BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL A FOREST WASTE. WHEN YOU CONVERT THAT ORGANIC WASTE TO HYDROGEN INSTEAD YOU CAN PROVIDE CARBON. NEGATIVE POWER. CAN ORGANICALLY TOO HIGH IS ALSO WAITING REDUCE SHORT LIVED POLLUTANT COUNTERFEITING THE MANSION SHE'D BEEN AT THE KLASKO CONFERENCE. I THINK THAT CONFERENCE UNDERSCORED VERY VERY STRONGLY THAT THE MOST URGENT THING WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGES TO REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS THE CLIMATE RIGHT AWAY AND AT SCALE. BOTH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE HEAD OF THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM SHE- SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT THING YOU CAN DO IN THE NEXT TEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IS TO REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS SHOW. ME TWO RECOMMENDATIONS NUMBER ONE. OUR DEFINITION BASED ON LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS. AND NUMBER TWO ORGANIC WASTE SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS AN ELIGIBLE FEEDSTOCK FOR GREEN HYDROGEN THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I WILL REMIND PEOPLE THAT YOU- WELCOME TO SEND MATERIAL TO US BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN GET MORE OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS OUT THERE AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY DISTRIBUTE THEM TO THE COMMITTEES. OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. YOUR THAT A COMPROMISE SEVENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS WAYNE LEVY ON COMMERCIAL HEAD FOR HYDROGEN MOBILITY AT SHELL I ALSO COMPLETED GRADUATE STUDY AT UC DAVIS IN TWENTY TEN IN THE TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY PROGRAM STUDYING THESE TRANSITIONS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY AND I'M WORKING HARD TO DELIVER. AT SHELL WE'RE DEVELOPING THE FULL RANGE OF% DECARBONIZE FUELS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING CHARGING A BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUELING OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND SO AS WE DO THIS THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES COMPETING FOR INVESTMENT WE DEVELOP AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF MARKETS AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. FOR WHOM EACH TECHNOLOGY IS AND WILL WORK WELL SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE MAY I PLEASE SUGGEST THREE POINTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION FIRST THE OPENING FRAME IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER NEEDS APPROPRIATE CARE PARAPHRASING. TO FOCUS ON THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE AT THE TIME COULD RISK LOSING PROGRESS ON THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE BECOMING COST EFFECTIVE AND AVAILABLE WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY IF SOLAR PANELS AND BEV'S HAD THIS APPROACH TWENTY TWENTY YEARS AGO. THERE'S NOW A TREMENDOUS PACE OF PROGRESS IN HYDROGEN FUELING AT SHELL WE'VE DOUBLED THE CAPACITY WHILE HAVING COST. TWICE ALREADY IN THE STATIONS. SECOND POINT TRAINING THAT BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN ALSO ELECTRIC VEHICLES SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF ENERGY SYSTEMS LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. THE OPPORTUNITY WITH HYDROGEN TO MAKE USE OF RENEWABLE MOLECULAR ENERGY FEEDSTOCKS FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY LIKE AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY WASTE. IN COMPLEMENT RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION AND PRODUCING HYDROGEN BY ELECTROLYSIS CAN MOVE STRANDED NOBLE POWER IN TIME AND SPACE TO ITS HIGHEST VALUE IN TRANSPORTATION. THOSE CAN HELP ENABLE THE AFFORDABLE AND RESILIENT RENEWABLE POWER AND BEV CHARGING GOALS THAT WE HAVE. WE FIND CALIFORNIA IS WELL INFORMED AND CONSTRUCTIVE IN ITS FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES OF RENEWABLE FEEDSTOCKS AND CARBON INTENSITY. AT SHALL WE FIRST TOLD A 100% RENEWABLE HYDROGEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE GOT TO ZERO CARBON INTENSITY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TIME IS UP AS WELL FINALLY. CAUGHT THE GREAT NEWS COLOR US NEXT COLOR PLEASE. THANK YOU. WHITE EIGHTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OUR COMMUNITY. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU GO AHEAD. GREAT THANKS SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS WOODY HASTINGS ON THE ENERGY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE CLIMATE TURNER- AND THANK YOU FR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- MY COMMENTS ARE ALSO ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE- WE'VE CLIMATE CENTER. I FEEL STATE INVESTMENT OF PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD FOCUS ON BRINGING THE COSTS DOWN OF RENEWABLE ENERGY BASED ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN- WE DO SEE THAT IS THE KEY TO MAKING HYDROGEN A TRULY- ARE TRULY ARE CLEAN FUEL INTO THE PRODUCTION AND WHERE THAT COMES INTO PLAY WE DO SHARE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY. JORDAN FROM THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL ABOUT THE USE OF BIOMASS ENERGY AND WE DO FEEL WITH NO PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO- CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE APPLICATION AT FOSSIL GAS- FROM RICK WE FORMATION PRODUCTION SYSTEMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANKS FOR STAYING WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT THE NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU BETTER COME FROM LINE EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE AND- BOTH SHARES- MY NAME IS BRADY BORDERING WITH FUEL CELL ENERGY OR A CONNECTICUT BASED MANUFACTURER OF STATIONARY FUEL CELLS. THAT PRODUCE BOTH ELECTRICITY AND HYDROGEN- WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING RIGHT NOW THE BY THE PORT OF LONG BEACH A PROJECT THAT WILL PRODUCE A TWO POINT THREE MEGAWATTS OF GREEN POWER UNDER THE BIO MAT TERRACE. AND BY TWELVE HUNDRED KILOGRAMS OF GREEN HYDROGEN TODAY PATTERSON WILL BE USED TO FUEL TOYOTA VEHICLES. AND CLASS EIGHT TRUCKS AT THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT. AT THE COUNTRY'S MANKER INFRASTRUCTURE TO DECARBONISE THE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR AND THE TRADE QUARTER AFTER THE ON A FIRE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY HAVING MANY BEYOND TO THE PROJECT YOU SEE IT FOR YOURSELF THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU I EIGHTEEN YELLOW IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. A GOOD AFTERNOON- JIM HOLLY LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. OF BOTH LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB LAB IN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OUR NATIONAL LEADERS IN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY COLLECTIVELY WE ARE INTERESTED IN HELPING CALIFORNIA NGUYEN. SIGNIFICANT HYDROGEN FUNDING IN THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND DEVELOPING A STRATEGY THE BEST ACCELERATES ACHIEVEMENTS OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS. A PARTIAL HIGHLIGHT OF OUR RESEARCH INCLUDES THAT WE CO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S MILLION MILE FUEL CALL CAR CONSORTIUM- TO ENABLE WIDESPREAD COMMERCIALIZATION AND EFFICIENT DURABLE FUEL CELLS. THAT WITH THE GOAL OF SYSTEMS THAT CAN POWER A LONG HAUL TRUCK FOR ONE MILLION MILES. WE FEEL FUEL CELLS CAN BE ESPECIALLY VALUABLE FOR HEAVY DUTY IN POLICE OPERATIONS BECAUSE FUNDING FILLING STATIONS CAN BE CONCENTRATED AT FEWER LOCATIONS THAN WILL BE NEEDED FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES. SUCH A LONG FREQUENTLY TRAVELED A LONG HAUL TRUCK QUARTERS. BERKELEY LAB IS ALSO A CO DEPUTY OF THE DEPARTMENT ENERGY EFFORT TO LOWER. THE COST OF ELECTROLYZER DEGREE HIGH. DELETE HELPS THIS A GOAL TO RID. THE COST OF IB BY EIGHTY PER FROM FIVE DOLLARS TO ONE KILOGRAM TWO ONE DOLLAR PER KILOGRAM THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WILL SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS ON THIS. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE MONEY FOR THE HYDROGEN HUBS WE BELIEVE THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THIS EASY TO SUPPORT ELECTROLYSIS. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN CALIFORNIA ON THE CUTTING EDGE. BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO SAY THE UC AND LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. TO WHEN SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CALIFORNIA AND ADVENTURE CLINICALS THANK. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU THAT I COME FROM NINE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI THIS ASSIGNMENT- JUSTICE CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT YES. GREAT THANK YOU- I WANTED TO PURCHASE FONG QUICKLY TOOK A GOOD QUESTION I HEARD FROM- THE CHAIR THAT YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE ADDING SO MUCH SCRUTINY ON HYDROGEN AND I JUST WANT TO GROUND THAT'S PERSON THAT. AND THE FACT OF THE STATUS QUO THAT 99% OF HYDROGEN TODAY IS FROM THE FAUPEL BASED ECONOMY THAT THE GAS INDUSTRY IS THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCER OF HYDROGEN IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONSUMER. AND IT IS NOW WELL WELL DOCUMENTED FACT THAT THE OIL SUPER MAJOR ISSUE FOR DECADES DENIED THE REALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK THE DUPLICATING OUTSTANDING MEMBERS OF MOST OF THE HYGIENE TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE CURRENT CENTER BEING THAT YOU CAN SUBTYPING CLIMATE FUNDING TOWARDS AWFUL DRY FUELS WHAT TIME OPINION PLEASE FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION UNDER. WAY TO ELECTRIFICATION- PROBABLY MORE IN. SO THAN WE JUST SPOKE ON THE- THAT THE CVS. I REPLY. HAS ALREADY FOUND THE CALIFORNIA HAS. INVESTED IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE TUNE TO SUPPORT. TWENTY FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF FUELING STATIONS. WE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN CARS ON THE ROAD. SO IT'S REALLY TIME TO STOP SANCTIONING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INVESTMENT. TOWARD THIS VASTLY UNDER UTILIZED FUELING NETWORK. GIVEN THAT WERE FAR OFF TRACK BUILDING ENOUGH CHARGING STATIONS TO KEEP UP WITH THE SURGING DVDFAB. AND ALMOST ALL THE HYDROGEN WE DISPENSED A THOUGHTFUL DERIVED. AND THE CLEAN THE LTFS SHIFTED UP TOWARDS RENEWABLE HYDROGEN IS DEMONSTRABLY FALSE. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE HYGIENIC CALIFORNIA THAT'S CLAIMED TO BE RENEWABLE. COMES FROM POSSIBLE DRUG CHARGES CHEN SHARED WITH THE PURCHASE OF BIO GAS CREDIT. IT'S NOT EVEN PRODUCE FROM ACTUAL BIOGAS IT'S JUST FROM BOTTLE GOD. WITH THE COUPLING OF CREDITS LANDFILLS IN INDIANA. OR FACTORY FARMS IN MISSISSIPPI. AND IT'S NOT JUST CARD THAT ARE ID. BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS ARE UNDERSTOOD BE THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD TASK. TO DECARBONISE ALMOST ALL OF ROAD TRANSPORT. PERSONAL 80% OF TRUCKS RUN LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES WHICH IS EASILY ACHIEVABLE FOR BATTERY TRUCKS. THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE MARKET YOUR TIME IS NOT FIVE YEARS NPE THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU- IS THERE ANOTHER CALLER OPERATOR. BUT I'M SURE THERE IS NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION I'M REALLY I'M SURPRISED THAT WE HAD SO MUCH PUBLIC- TESTIMONY TODAY AND VERY VERY GLAD TO HEAR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- AND WE GOT THE GIST OF ALL THE CALLS EVEN IF WE DIDN'T. YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE LIKE YOU KNOW TEN MINUTES TALK ABOUT IT I THINK WE GOT WE GOT YOUR POINT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. AS WE SEE THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE STATE IS MAKING CERTAIN THE INVESTMENT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE INTEREST IN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY AND- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD TO DECARBONISING. OF NOT JUST A% TRANSPORTATION BUT ANYTHING THAT IS PRODUCING CARBON IT'S AT ADD IN MASS AMOUNTS- IT VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND TRANSPORTATION BEING ONE OF THE- THE BIGGEST ONES- THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE SEE THE VOLATILITY OF GAS PRICES WE SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN- AND IT'S- CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT NEW BUT THE- THE CONNECTION BETWEEN. REALLY BAD- ACTORS AROUND THE GLOBE- IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AND THE CONNECTION TO GAS PRICES HERE AT HOME EVERY TIME- WE ENTER INTO ANY KIND OF A- FRIGHTENING GEOPOLITICAL. EVENTS LIKES HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. A WE NEED TO HAVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEAN ENERGY IT CANNOT BE FOSSIL FUELS IT'S GOT TO BE. ZERO EMISSION FUELS. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING AREA BUT ONE OF COURSE THAT WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE INTO IT WE DON'T JUST REPLACE ONE POLLUTING FUEL WITH ANOTHER- SO THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL HERE BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE CALIFORNIA AND IF WE DO HYDROGEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THESE HEARINGS ARE ALL ABOUT. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD AND I. WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO MY CULTURE THREE OF US FROM NATURAL RESOURCES. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND TO YOUR TEAM FOR ORGANIZING. THIS HEARING TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS THE PANELISTS. AND THE PUBLIC I LEARNED SO MUCH TODAY AND- I AGREE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE- IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE ARE ADJOURNED.
