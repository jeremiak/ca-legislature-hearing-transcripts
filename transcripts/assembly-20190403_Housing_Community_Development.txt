ON OUR OCCUPANCY TO ISSUE AN EIGHTY YOU A PERMIT FOR AN EIGHTY YEAR HOWEVER WE THINK THE LANGUAGE.

HAS BEEN ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING OVER THE YEARS -- BUT I THINK WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN IN CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES MY OWN -- THAT WE CAN HAVE SUCCESSFUL EIGHTY YOU POLICIES EVEN WITHOUT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT -- AND WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE CREATION OF A TO USE SO WITH THAT. I THINK -- MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A DIRECTION OF SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND WITH THAT -- I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS. FOR A VOTE AT THIS TIME SO WANT WE PASS OVER UNTIL WE DO AND WE'LL LET YOU GET TO YOUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER THANKS. WHEN HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN -- LET'S GO NEXT TO FILE ITEM SEVEN A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR MISTER GRAYSON GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM. MORE THAN WILLING TO ACCEPT AND THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHOR -- AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL SURVEY CALIFORNIA'S DEVELOPMENT FEES ARE NEARLY THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT THESE DEVELOPMENT FEES ARE OFTEN PASSED ALONG TO HOME BUYERS PUTTING HOMEOWNERSHIP FURTHER OUT OF REACH FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT BY UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER FOUND THAT DEVELOPMENT FEES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE. ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND THAT PROJECTS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL EXACTIONS NOT CODIFIED IN ANY FEE SCHEDULE ALL OF THESE FACTORS COMBINED TO MAKE DEVELOPMENT RISKIER MORE COSTLY AND ALTERNATELY SERVE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING. THAT GETS BUILT IN OUR STATE. GIVEN THE EXTENT OF OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS WE NEED TO EXPLORE ALL THE OPTIONS TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE LOCAL AGENCIES TO PROVIDE A DEVELOPMENT PROPONENT WITH A GOOD FAITH STATEMENT DISCLOSE THE DISCLOSING THE AMOUNT OF IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. APPLICABLES TO A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL PROHIBIT LOCAL AGENCIES FROM INCREASING THESE FEES FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THE TIME THE DEVELOP AN APPLICATION IS DEEMED COMPLETE. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE LOCAL AGENCY TO PRO -- TO POSE ON ITS WEBSITE A LIST OF ALL FEES APPLICABLES TO A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THESE CHANGES TO EXISTING LAW WILL ADD MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY AND CERTAINTY TO THE HOUSING DEVELOP A PROCESS REDUCINGCOST AND LENGTH OF DEVELOPMENT CYCLE AND ALSO ONLY HELPING TO ADDRESS. OUR ON GOING HOUSING CRISIS WITH ME TODAY OR TWO WITNESSES MERRY ON A WIRE -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM AND ALSO ANDREW BECAUSE OF OUR WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR MY NAME IS INJURED BECAUSE IT ARE IN ON THE SCIENTIST AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE AT THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION CBA. CBI IS A STATE WIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING. THIRTY ONE HUNDRED IT'S INVOLVED IN RESIDENTIAL AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION CVA MEMBER COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTING OVER 85% OF THE NEW HOMES BUILT IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR. C. A.'S PLEASE TO CO SPONSOR AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY THE HONORABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT LOCAL AGENCIES FROM IMPOSING. ANY ADDITIONAL FEES ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AFTER THE PROJECT APPLICATION IS COMPLETE. MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PUBLISH THE SCHEDULES OR PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF THOSE FEES AND THE EFFECT OF THOSE FEES ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE. IN A RECENT STUDY FOCUSED ON A HANDFUL CALIFORNIA CITIES UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION FOUND THE DEVELOPMENT FEES OFTEN LIKE TRANSPARENCY. IMPOSE HIGH COST AND HAVE ARBITRARY STRUCTURE OF THE CITY OF THE SEVEN CITIES ANALYZE THEY FOUND THAT FEES WERE UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. AT THE FEES CAN AMOUNT UPWARDS OF 18% OF THE COST OF A MEDIAN HOME. DOES THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY COUPLED WITH A POTENTIALLY SIX FIGURE FEES MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR HOME BUILDERS TO ESTIMATE COSTS IN ALREADY UNCERTAIN TUMULTUOUS MARKET. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AGREEING LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY TO THE PROCESS -- AS AS CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES WITH HOUSING CRAP HOUSING CRISIS SUCH TRANSPARENCY IS SORELY NEEDED IN ORDER TO REMOVE UNCERTAINTY AND HELP ENCOURAGE HOMEBUILDING FOR THESE REASONS. CVA SUPPORTS FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR RESPECT AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I'VE OF THANK YOU MISS WHITE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARINO WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM TEACH THESE MEMBERS PRODUCED AND PRESERVE HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AS I KNOW YOU ARE WELL AWARE ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS PAY MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOMES ON RENT. AND LOWER CAL INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS THE STATE IS SHORT. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOMES AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ADD MORE CERTAINTY TO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WILL ALLOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BUILD MORE UNITS. MORE EFFICIENTLY AND THAT AND MAKE A BIGGER DENT IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS YCC IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB FORTY FOUR AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS ISSUE. LET'S MOVE TO OTHER SUPPORTERS. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBER YELLING AVERAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WERE ALSO. A PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WE PLEASE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. NEXT PAR GOOD MORNING SO AS A MATTER NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY EAST BAY SILICON VALLEY HABITAT CALIFORNIA AFFILIATE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ENDLESS MONDAY WITH CALIFORNIA BID SUPPORT. SENATE GEORGE WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY SUPPORT IF AMENDED WE WORKED ON A SIMILAR BILL -- LAST YEAR WITH THAT IN THAT SENATOR CAFIERO -- WE DO NEED SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES BEYOND WHAT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT RECOMMENDED AND COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE FEES WITHOUT THAT WE CAN'T DO IT -- WE DO NEED TO HAVE THE FEES THEMSELVES TIED DOWN TO SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHICH FEES ARE GOING. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL -- WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE THE FEES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE THOSE IMPOSED ON THE HOUSING UNITS IN A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT NOT JUST THE ENTIRE. DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE FEES CALCULATED WOULD BE FOR THE UNITS THE HOUSING UNITS IN A PROJECT IF IT'S MIXED USE IT WOULD NOT BE COMMERCIAL SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS YOU STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. BY THE SUPPORTERS [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. IS ONE OF THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD THIS IS A CONCEPT -- I HAVE SUPPORTED BEFORE -- AND I THINK I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE WHO THINKS THAT THE FEES WE HAVE AROUND THE STATE ARE. CRITICALLY RATIONAL -- OR AT LEAST ALL THE FEES THAT WE HAVE -- I ALSO WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE WAS A BILL. THAT REQUIRES EACH C. D. TO STUDY FEES AND THAT WAS AUTHORED BY THIS BY OUR AUTHOR TODAY. A VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THAT -- AND AS THE AUTHOR NOT DISCUSSED -- AM HOPEFUL THAT TO DEPENDING ON WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT WE MAY SEE FUTURE MOMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT MAY TACKLE THAT -- WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR IF WE COULD -- IT AS AS AMENDMENTS MOVE FOR BE IN DISCUSSION WITH YOU ON THAT AND I KNOW THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE WILLING TO DO -- BUT I THINK THIS IS -- DEFINITELY TOPIC THAT WE SHOULD TACKLE THIS YEAR AND VERY MUCH COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND YOUR SPONSORS FOR A MOVING THIS FORWARD -- WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT AS SOON AS WE DO WE WILL TAKE A MOTION OF IT FOR ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I FELT GREAT THANK YOU. SURE WE STILL HAVE A QUORUM AT THIS TIME BUT IN CASE FOLKS ARE WANTING ABOUT THE MAKE UP OF TODAY'S COMMITTEE WITH A COUPLE OF ILLNESSES SO -- WE HAVE MISTER STONE WHO'S GOING TO BE REPLACING ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA AND WE HAVE EVENTUALLY MISTER BONTA WHO'S GONNA COME AND REPLACE BRIAN MAIENSCHEIN JUST FOR TODAY SO WITHOUT.

THIS YEAR -- FIRST IMAGES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ARE YOUR CONSULTANT FOR THE A. B. AMENDMENTS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM -- OU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE REALLY NEED FOR EIGHTY USES -- FAST AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO REALLY ATTACK THIS. HOUSING CRISIS THAT'S REALLY -- HITTING US ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- DID THIS BILL STREAMLINES MANY THE PROVISIONS SO THAT BUT STOP CITIES FROM BASICALLY BANNING EIGHTY USE FOR EXAMPLE. MON HAS A LOCAL EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCE NOT ALLOWING EIGHTY USE ON ANY LOTS THAT ARE LESS THAN EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET -- SO UNFORTUNATELY IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DE FACTO BAN IN THAT TYPE OF CITY WE SEE THAT IN CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- THIS BILL STREAMLINES IT REALLY ENCOURAGES CITIES TO START BUILDING EIGHTY USE REALLY ALLOWING IT USED TO BE BUILT -- WE REALLY SEE THIS AS A FAST AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET HOUSING PRODUCTION -- BUILD UP IN THE IN THE STATE WE HAVE TO TWO GREAT WITNESSES WE HAVE LOOSE -- MERON TAPE FROM MY CALIFORNIAN B. AND HELEN LEON FROM HELLO HOUSING. WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING -- LIST MONDAY WITH CALIFORNIA BE -- I WOULD JUST ADD THAT RESEARCH FROM UC BERKELEY SHOWS EIGHTY IS COST LESS TO BUILD AND TO RENT -- THEN COMMENCE HERBAL APARTMENT UNITS I'M MAKING A MOVE IN AFFORDABLE AND ECO FRIENDLY SOURCE OF NEW HOUSING ARE JUST PART. HELEN LEARN A WITH LA MUST WEAR NONPROFIT URBAN DESIGN ORGANIZATION BASED IN LOS ANGELES WE'VE ALSO BEEN SUPPORTING THE CITY AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES UNDER EIGHTY YOU PILOT PROJECTS. DEMONSTRATING HOW EIGHTY USE CAN BE CONTRACTUALLY DESIGN A POORLY BUILT AND HELP WITH THEIR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. I'M AND IN LA SINCE STATE LAW PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAVE SEEN NEARLY TEN THOUSAND PERMITS. ON EIGHTY IS AND THAT'S A REFLECTION OF NOT HAVING RESTRICTIONS ON OWNER OCCUPANCY LOT SIZES FOR ERROR RATIO AND AND A LOT COVERAGE SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IN ADDITION BECAUSE WE HAVE LAUNCHED A PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES TO HELP AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS BECOME PROVIDERS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'VE HAD LOTS OF HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECTION EIGHT PROGRAM. AND MANY HOMEOWNERS ACTUALLY WISH THEY COULD DO MORE THAN ONE EIGHTY YOU AND DO IT ON A MULTI PROPERTY LOT SO THAT'S AN EXCITING COMPONENT THE BILL WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE. MORE HOMERS PARTICIPATE IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE HALF A MILLION SINGLE FAMILY LOTS AND MANY MORE MULTI FAMILY UNIT LOTS. I IF THIS BILL PASSES WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN. HAVE EIGHTY USE AS A HOUSING TYPOLOGY THAT CAN SUPPORT NOT JUST MORE HOUSING UNITS BUT ALSO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL.

ON THE ON HOMES AND HOMES THAT ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. THE BILL ALSO STATES THAT THE STANDARDS MUST BE COST EFFECTIVE AS COST EFFECTIVE AS A STANDARDS IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CALIFORNIA. BUILDING STANDARDS CODES. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE STANDARDS AND MANDATES ALL OF WHICH WERE ADDED TO THE BUILDING CODE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND AND SEVEN HAVE ADDED APPROXIMATELY. COST OF BUILDING EACH NEW HOME ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ESTIMATES FOR EIGHTY USE I IMAGINE THAT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE STANDARDS AND CODES OR SIMILAR OR PERHAPS A LITTLE LESS FOR AN EIGHTY YOU. GIVEN THAT THERE'S STILL A BASELINE INSTALLATION COST IN THAT THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE BIT SAVE THE MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS MOST OF THE STANDARDS MANDATES ADDED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHILE COMMENDABLE IN CONCEPT.

CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE FUNDS TO BE RESERVED FOR FOUR YEARS AND THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY EXTEND THAT TIME LINE TO EIGHT YEARS. WITHOUT A LIKE TO HAND OVER JASON'S OFFICE REPRESENTED CITY MANUALS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHASING AND SALAS REPRESENTING THE CITY OF INDIAN WELLS -- AS THE AUTHORS SAY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE VERY FEW COMMUNITIES THAT BECAME OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS POST REDEVELOPMENT SOLUTION. TO RETAIN THEIR CAPITAL RESERVES FOR EIGHT YEARS RATHER THAN FOUR YEARS THE CITY OF ANY WELLS OPERATES TO COMMUNITIES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN UNITS -- AND THIS ALLOWS THEM TO INSURE THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN ORDER TO DO.

SO GET THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING ABOUT -- AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH IS THE FARM WORKER HOUSING ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I DO WANT TO THANK FIRST OF ALL THE HOUSING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK PREPARING -- THE ANALYSIS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE ARE ALL AWARE. YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING A SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE. AND THE SHORTAGE ISN'T JUST AN URBAN PROBLEM MANY AGRICULTURE. AGRICULTURAL AREAS IN OUR STATE ALSO FACE A HOUSING CRISIS. IN RURAL MONTEREY COUNTY ONE IN TEN STUDENTS. ARE HOMELESS. AND IN FACT WE HAVE TWELVE SCHOOLS IN MONTEREY COUNTY WHERE ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. AND IT SURE WOULD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SALINAS THAT NUMBER IS NEARLY FOUR IN. TEN WE HAVE FAMILIES LIVING FOURTEEN PEOPLE TO AN APARTMENT. AND OTHERS ARE SLEEPING IN CARS OR UNDER FREEWAY OVERPASSES. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TOUGH ON OUR FARMWORKERS. FARMWORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. AND TOGETHER WITH OUR FAMILY FARMERS THEY WORK TO BRING THE FRESHEST PRODUCE TO MARKET. AND CERTAINLY DO THEIR PART IN HELPING FEED IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. YET THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE DECENT PLACES FOR THEM TO LIVE. AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. AB. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE CREATE A STREAMLINED PROCESS TO BUILD FARM WORKER HOUSING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND. SETS QUALITY STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW HOUSING IS DIGNIFIED AND FAMILY FRIENDLY. AND PUT SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL ALSO TEARS DOWN LOCAL RED TAPE. RED TAPE THAT TOO OFTEN PREVENTS REZONING OF LAND TO ALLOW FORMER HOUSING. LOOK AT THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET TO SOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS. BUT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD FOR FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL CREATE A TOOL KIT. A TOOL KIT FOR OUR FARMERS TO USE IF THEY CHOOSE TO USE IT. IF THEY WOULD RATHER NOT UTILIZE IT THEY DON'T HAVE. TO I'VE SPOKEN TO LOCAL FARMERS WHO HAVE THANKED ME FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY WOULD UTILIZE THIS TOOL THEY WOULD UTILIZE THIS OPTION. THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD HELP TO REVITALIZE OUR BUSINESS. TO HELP THEM BUILD HOUSING FOR THE WORKERS. THAT THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY I'M NEW TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND AS ONE OF YOUR NEWS COLLEAGUES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT I CAN SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE. YOU SEE MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FARM WORKER AT ALMADEN VINEYARDS AND PISCINE THIS CALIFORNIA. I GREW UP IN FORMER HOUSING. I LIVE WITH TEN MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. OUR HOUSING COMPLEXES LOCATED RIGHT BESIDE THE VINEYARD WHEN MY GRANDFATHER WORKED. OUR HOUSING WAS VERY BASIC. BUT IT WAS DECENT. OUR SMALL TWO ROOM HOME GAVE OUR FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR A BETTER LIFE. BUT MANY FARMWORKERS THEN AND NOW. ARE NOT SO LUCKY. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. IN THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO WORK THE FEELS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER DID. AND WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR CURRENT GENERATION OF FARMWORKERS THAT THEIR CHILDREN. ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE AT A BETTER LIFE AND A BRIGHTER FUTURE. AND I WANT TO THANK. KHATAMI LIKE CHAVEZ FOR BEING HERE TODAY. SHE'S A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CAMILA IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOORS WHAT THE FOUNDATION SHE'S ALSO THE NIECE OF SAYS ARE TRAVIS AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE GREAT THE DOORS WHAT THE AND BEING HERE IN THIS ROOM. WITH HER. WORKING TOGETHER ON A FARM WORKER HOUSING BILL IS SURREAL. IT'S A REAL BECAUSE OVER FORTY YEARS AGO HER MOTHER DELORES HUERTA. TRAVEL TO ALMADEN VINEYARDS IN SAN BENITO COUNTY. TO HELP MY GRANDFATHER. THE MAN WHO RAISED MY BROTHER. NINE SHE HELPED MY GRANDFATHER SECURE EQUAL RIGHTS IN THE FIELDS. AND BETTER PAY TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY OF SEVEN THE LORD'S WORK THE NEGOTIATED MY GRANDFATHER'S FIRST UNION CONTRACT. AND HELPED PAVE THE WAY FOR MY FAMILY TO GET OUT OF THE FIELDS AND INTO THE CLASSROOM. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE WORK OF THE LORD WHAT THE I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE TODAY. AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. THIS BILL SEVENTEEN A THREE CONTINUES THE IMPORTANT WORK STARTED BY MY GRANDFATHER BY OTHER HARD WORKING FARMWORKERS. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY RESIDENT IN OUR STATE IS TREATED WITH DIGNITY [inaudible] AND RESPECT. AND GIVEN A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. I IMPLORE EACH ONE OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE TO RISE ABOVE POLITICS. TO CAST A VOTE THAT WILL BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THERE ARE FORMER BECAUSE ARE FACING ACROSS THIS STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN ADDITION -- TO MISS CHAVEZ I'M ALSO JOINED HERE -- THIS MORNING BY OUR BILL SPONSOR AND OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I'LL ASK THAT THEY INTRODUCE THEMSELVES BECAUSE I OFTEN WILL YOU KNOW -- I'M I MAKE A FARCE OF ALL THESE NAMES AND AND SO ALLOW THAN IT IS IT'S OFFICER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THE MORNING CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BONITA AVAILABLE STREET MATTER. I AM THE UNITED FARM WORKERS REGIONAL OPERATIONS MANAGER IN THE CENTRAL COAST -- TOO OFTEN FARMWORKERS ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN THE STATE CAPITAL. FEW PEOPLE SEE THE CONDITIONS WE LIVE IN. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT ASSEMBLYMAN REAVIS HAS DECIDED IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OFFICE TO PUT FARMWORKERS FIRST. THE HISTORY OF OUR MARK A HOUSING POLICY IN OUR STATE BEGINS WITH LABOR CAMPS -- LABOR CAMPS. DID NOT HAVE THE TENT TENDENCY PROTECTIONS -- LABOR CAMPS DID NOT HAVE TITLE TWENTY FOUR REGULATIONS THEY DID NOT HAVE STATE. EXCUSE ME THEY DO NOT HAVE RENT STABILITY. THEY WERE COLD DAMP AND INDECENT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THEY WERE CONTROLLED BY THE EMPLOYER. MOST FARMWORKERS DO NOT LIVE IN LABOR CAMPS TODAY. BUT IN THE LABOR CAMPS THAT DO EXIST MANY STILL HAVE BERWICK STYLE HOUSING. MOST FARMWORKERS STRUGGLE TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CROWD INTO SMALL APARTMENTS LIVE WITH MULTIPLE FAMILIES AND SMALL HOUSE. OR RENT OUT GARAGES. OTHER FARMWORKERS HAVE EVEN TOUGHER SITUATIONS. THEY'RE SLEEPING UNDER BRIDGES SLEEPING IN THE COLD DAMP GROUND. SLEEPING IN TENTS SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND PUTTING ARE IN DECENT HOUSING POLICIES. OF THIS STATE WHERE THEY BELONG. IN THE PAST. FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO CONTINUE BUILDING AND SUPPORT FARM WORKER HOUSING WITHOUT TENANTS PROTECTIONS LIKE IN THE PAST. THE UNITED FARM WORKERS SAYS YOU CAN GO BACK WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KEEP CONTROL TOTAL CONTROL OVER EVERY ASPECT OF FARMWORKERS LIVES THE UNITED FARM WORKERS SAY YOU CAN GO BACK WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. THE UNITED FARM WORKERS SAYS IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO BACK IN TIME YOU GO WITH YOU GO BACK WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY OR HELP. WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CYNTHIA RICE ON THE LITIGATION COORDINATOR FOR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. THIS YEARLY FOUNDATION HAS BEEN REPRESENTING AGE TO A WORKERS AND US WORKERS EMPLOYED UNDER AGE TO A JOB WORK ORDERS. FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES THIS BILL -- INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT WOULD LIMIT THE STATE FUNDING BUT NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR H. TO A WORKERS. I'M AND I'M HERE TO ADDRESS -- THE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR THE INCLUSION OF THAT SECTION IN THE BILL AND SUPPORT THE BILL -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EACH WAY WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. INCREASING FROM THREE THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THIS IS STILL A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL FARM WORKER POPULATION THAT IS IN NEED OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT UNDER THE AGE TO A PROGRAM GROWERS IN FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS CONTROL NOT ONLY THE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS. OF THEIR WORKERS THEY CAN TAKE THEY CONTROL THE EIGHT ADMISSION THE DURATION OF THEIR STATE THE HOUSING THEY LIVE IN THE FOOD THEY EAT. HOW THEY GET TO WORK IN THE MORNING AND WHEN THEY GET HOME AT NIGHT? AND THE HOUSING IS PROVIDED THEY CONTROL NOT JUST A LOCATION BUT THE BAD THAT THEY SLEEP IN WHO CAN VISIT THEM WHEN THEY CAN WHAT THEY CAN DO ON THE PREMISES AND EVEN WHO CAN VISIT THEM. AT EVEN WHAT TIME TO GO TO BED AT NIGHT AND SOME ORDERS. REPRESENTING THESE WORKERS WE HAVE SEEN VIOLATIONS AT EVERY PHASE OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. WORKERS ARE LIED TO DURING RECRUITMENT THEY'RE NOT REIMBURSED FOR THEIR TRAVEL EXPENSES THEY SUFFER VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA LABOR AND HOUSING PROTECTIONS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW EXISTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FROM THIS COUNTRY MUCH LESS A STATE. U. S. WORKERS SUFFER THE SAME VIOLATIONS THE H. TO A WORKERS WHO WANT TO OBJECT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE RISKING NOT ONLY THEIR JOB. BUT THEIR HOUSING THEIR FOOD AND THEY'RE VERY RIGHT TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORK. US WORKERS KNOW THAT IF THEY DON'T ACCEPT THESE SUB STANDARD CONDITIONS THERE'S ANOTHER AGE TO A WORKER WAITING IN THE WINGS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE JOB FORCE. WITH THE RECENT INCREASE IN AGE TO A ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. HAS COME A SIGNIFICANT. SURE ON THE LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AVAILABLE TO FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN AREAS LIKE SANTA MARIA LOMPOC THE SALINAS VALLEY VENTURA COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE. PRESSURES BEING PUT ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES TESTIFIED ABOUT WHERE WORKERS WERE FAMILIES ARE ALREADY DOUBLING UP AND TRIPLING UP IN ORDER TO AFFORD HOUSING. OFTEN AFTER CERTIFICATION EXCUSE ME DURING CERTIFICATION PROCESS THESE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES ARE CERTIFIED TO HOUSE. TWENTY H. TO A WORKERS. AFTER CERTIFICATION THAT NUMBER OFTEN INCREASES TO TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY UNLAWFULLY AND THE AND WORKERS ARE SAID SUBJECTED TO SUB STANDARD CONDITIONS DURING THE ENTIRE TERM OF THEIR WORKING CONTRACT. THESE HOMES ARE LOCATED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THIS BILL THEY'RE SORELY LACKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND THEY NEED TO STREAMLINING PROCESS FOR FOR APPROVAL THAT'S LAID OUT. BUT THAT BENEFIT WILL NOT COME TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF FARMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IF THE EMPHASIS IS ON DEVELOPING BERWICK STYLE HOUSING FOR H. TO A WORKERS. THEREFORE THE EXCEPTION IN THIS BILL APPLIES. WE APPRECIATE THE NEED TO HOUSE H. WAY WORKERS WE UNDERSTAND THE PER FAST NEED FOR THIS LABOR STREAM. THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH THE GROWERS ABILITY TO HIRE. THE H. TO A WORKERS OR TO DEVELOP HOUSING FOR THEM. BUT IT DOESN'T SURE THAT GOING FORWARD STATE FUNDS FOR THE DESPERATELY NEEDED RURAL HOUSING AND RURAL CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE DIVERTED TO DEVELOP BERWICK STYLE HOUSING FOR H. TO A WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK OF THEIR THEIR SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. LOUIS MONTANA BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BE IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS ON FEDERAL NO PRESIDENT PRIORITY STRATEGIES BUT HERE ACTUALLY ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AS A BENEFICIARY OF A FORMER HOUSING THAT DID EMPHASIZE FAMILY ORIENTED HOUSING AND WHETHER LOOP IN NORTHERN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- I'M A DIRECT BENEFICIARY AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF SUCCESS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE AS A AS A SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA. BY A FORTIES OPPORTUNITIES TO TO THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE YOU KNOW WORK IN THE FIELDS AND AND DOING TIRELESS WORK TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FRESH FOOD ON OUR TABLES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ON A LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN TERM ON POVERTY APOLOGIES FOR NOT GETTING OUR LETTERING ON TIME BUT WHEN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CAMILLA CHáVEZ I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE THE LOTUS WORTH A FOUNDATION AND DAUGHTER OF THE LOTUS WORTH ANY SUCCESS SUCH HAVE IS HAVE MANY YEARS GROWING UP IN THE FARMWORKERS MOVEMENT. A CURRENTLY THF WORKS AT THE SCENE ALSO NEED THOSE UNITED NEIGHBORS AND WE WORK WITH THOUSANDS OF FARMWORKERS AND KERN TO LARRY AND FRESNO COUNTIES. FARMWORKERS AS YOU KNOW MAKE MINIMUM WAGE AND ORGAN AVERAGE OF EIGHT MONTHS A YEAR. TODAY AND WE ARE FACING A SERIOUS HOUSING CRISIS. I HAVEN'T SEEN ALSO NEEDLES MEMBERS LIVE IN EXTREMELY CROWDED SPACES. WE OFTEN ME AND HOUSE MEETINGS AND OFTEN HAVE TO MEET OUTSIDE BECAUSE OUR FRANKLY JUST ISN'T ENOUGH ROOM INSIDE THEIR HOMES OR TRAILERS WHERE THEY LIVE. DHL WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTS THIS BILL AS AN OPTION NOT A MANDATE FOR FORWARD THINKING AGRICULTURE COMPANIES AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER A COMPANY SUCH AS PARAMOUNT FARMS WHO TRULY INVEST IN THEIR WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. BY BUILDING HOUSING AND OTHER RECREATIONAL SERVICES THANK YOU. LAURIE JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SALINAS AND SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PLEASE IF I COULD ASK -- ONE OR TWO OF THE WHEN THIS IS IF YOU COULD PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I MATTHEW ON WITH A REPRESENT WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION -- WE REGRETFULLY HAVE TO OPPOSE -- THE BILL TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS FORMER HOUSING WITH THE AUTHOR -- NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES AND WITH THE STAFF WE APPRECIATE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AT AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO REMAINING GAUGED. MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE TRULY THERE IS A LACK OF AVAILABLE FOR WILL. HOUSING FOR FARMWORKERS IN CALIFORNIA -- BEFORE I GET INTO MORE DETAIL ON THAT I JUST WANTED A MOMENT JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SINCE IT WAS MENTIONED -- GLORIA FARMS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO ABIDE BY ALL FEDERAL LAW IN CALIFORNIA LABOR LAW AND I AM NOT DOING SO -- THEY ARE FACED WITH -- PENALTIES -- IN AND THE THE VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD GO WITH ALSO A TWENTY MAKE THAT CLEAR -- IS PART OF DISCUSSION. IN RELATION -- TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE'RE HAVE DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT THE MINISTER OF PERMITTING PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNLESS THE FARMER TURNS OPERATION OF THEIR HOUSING OVER TO A THIRD PARTY QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS. FEW FARMERS WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THIS AS THEY WOULD REMAIN ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HOUSING. AND ANY LIABILITY CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH -- ITS OPERATION. WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD INSTEAD COMMIT TO FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT DISCOURAGE FARMERS FROM DEPLOYING THEIR CAPITAL AND THEIR LAND TO MEET THIS URGENT NEED. UNFORTUNATELY WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN REGARDING LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REGARDING THE PROHIBITION ON UTILIZING STATE FUNDS -- FOR HOUSING REGARDING -- EACH TO EMPLOYEES THE REALITY IS THAT FARMERS HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN THE U. S. ARE TURNING TO THE H. TO A PROGRAM IN DESPERATION DUE TO THE ONGOING LABOR SHORTAGE. IN AGRICULTURE. THE THIRD POINT WE WANTED TO BRING UP IS THAT THE BILL APPEARS TO TIE -- TENET HOUSING RIGHTS. TO CURRENT EMPLOYEE HOUSING RIGHTS WHEN THE TO REALLY SHOULD REMAIN DISTINCT BECAUSE THE HOUSING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR BOTH ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL [inaudible] THEIR OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA NOTATE JACK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSING GARDEN CENTERS CALIFORNIA CUT FLOWER COMMISSION. AND AMERICAN PISTACHIO GROWERS AGAIN REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH US -- BUT WE ARE OPPOSED FOR THE SAME REASONS AS WAS MENTIONED BY WESTERN GROWERS REPRESENTATIVE -- AND JUST WANT TO LOOK TOWARDS BETTER SOLUTIONS -- FOR EXAMPLE -- THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAD SOME MEMBERS THAT WERE BUILDING HOUSING ON THE CENTRAL COAST. MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS AND IT WAS FOR FAMILY HOUSING. AND THEN IN THOSE HOUSES BEFORE THEY CAN BE COMPLETED REX LEE BURN DOWN BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY SO WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF ISSUES LIKE THAT WE LOVE TO TALK TO THE AUTHOR -- ABOUT THOSE ISSUES HOW WE CAN WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE OF THESE HOUSES CAN BE BUILT AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DISCOURAGING. FARMERS FROM COMMITTING THEIR LAND IN CAPITAL TO THIS TYPE OF HOUSING THANK YOU. MORNING DEVIN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF FAMILY WINE MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING A THREE MILLION -- HAVE TO CALIFORNIA PEAR GROWERS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION -- I THINK I'LL JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR IN YOUR SUPPORTERS IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION -- I DON'T THINK SO I YOU KNOW I THINK -- ULTIMATELY. MYSELF AND STAFF -- YOU KNOW. BE HAPPY TO ME WITH WITH WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND ULTIMATELY WE CREATED A BILL THAT -- IS SIMPLY AN OPTION YOU KNOW NOBODY HAS TO UTILIZE -- THIS BILL -- BUT CERTAINLY IT DOES ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THE DISTRICT AND I THINK -- MANY OF US WILL AGREE THAT THIS IS A BILL YOU KNOW THAT MOST POLICY THAT COMES OUT OF THIS BUILDING SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY GOOD DATA. AND SO DATA WAS THIS IT WAS IT WAS THE PRIMARY REASON WHY YOU KNOW WE CREATE THIS BILL AND WHEN AND WHY SAY ABOUT DATA IN JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WAS A FARM WORKER HOUSING STUDY AN ACTION PLAN. THAT WAS RELEASED -- IT WAS -- IT WAS CONDUCTED. SO IT WAS RELEASED IN JULY BUT WAS CONDUCTED BY THE SALINAS APOLLO VALLEY'S -- AND WHAT THE STUDY SAID IS IT IT COME FROM THE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ARE LIVING AND SEVERELY OVERCROWDED -- THESE CONDITIONS SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS -- AND THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE WAS A PREPONDERANCE OF WORKERS THAT WERE YEAR ROUND RESIDENTS. AND THOSE THAT WERE SURVEYED 75% OF THE PEOPLE I WAS A WE WERE MARRIED AND OFTEN LIVE IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH MINOR CHILDREN AND SO THE BASICALLY THIS DATA WHAT. THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL PLAN SUGGESTED WAS THAT MUCH OF THE FOCUS THAT HAS BEEN PUT ON ON ON HOUSING FOR TEMPORARY FARMWORKERS. THAT THE DATA THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CLEAR THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED WAS FOR PERMANENT FARM WORKER FAMILY HOUSING AND SO CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW IN A PERFECT WORLD DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WOULD GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER CONGRESS AND FIX IMMIGRATION -- THE WE SHOULDN'T BE DEPENDING ON A GUEST WORKER PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW FOR ALL THESE YEARS THAT WE HAVE -- CERTAINLY THIS IS A POLITICAL ISSUE AND CONGRESS THESE DO SOMETHING AND AND GET REAL ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM -- BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY A STATE SOLUTION. TO A STATEWIDE PROBLEM -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE OUR ATTENDED TO CONSERVE THIS BILL. AND AGAIN JUST A TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS -- AGAIN THIS BILL IS OPTIONAL IT DOES NOT LIMIT ANY GROWER OR OTHER AGRICULTURE ENTERPRISE FROM DEVELOPING HOUSING FARMER HOUSING WHAT IT DOES IS. EXEMPT THEM FROM THE PROCESS UNLESS THEY AGREED TO WORK WITH A THIRD PARTY. CURRENTLY MANY GROWERS AND OPERATORS WORK WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE THEIR HOUSING ANYWAY YEAH IT'S NOT A HUGE CHANGE FROM THE BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS -- THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF AB EXAMPLES WHERE THAT'S THE CASE MONTEREY COUNTY -- THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT AND ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. THANK YOU -- IS LIMóN. THANK YOU THANK YOU AT TO THE AUTHOR I HAVE A QUESTION FOR OPPOSITION AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN GET OPPOSITION. SO ONE OF THE THE ELEMENTS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED MULTIPLE TIMES IS THAT THIS BILL IS OPTIONAL. AND DOES NOT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE ADOPTED BY ANY -- FARMER THAT DOES NOT CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND WHY YOU WOULD STILL OPPOSE SOMETHING THAT'S OPTIONAL NOT REQUIRED. IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION -- I PROBABLY A COUPLE POINTS ON THAT -- THERE'S DEFINITELY A LABOR SHORTAGE ISSUE OUT THERE AND WERE HAVING ISSUES REALLY THE NIMBY. NIMBY AS AND WHEN THAT'S OCCURRING UNFORTUNATELY REGARDING FARMER HOUSING -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE ISSUE COMES. TO IT'S A CRISIS -- IT'S IT'S WERE PICKING UP PRODUCTION AG LAND ACTUALLY SITE THE HOUSING USING OUR OWN CAPITAL WE'RE GOING TO STILL BE ALIVE ON RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MINISTER OR MINISTER PERMITTING PROCESS FOR THIS TYPE OF HOUSING YEARS AGO BECAUSE REALLY NOT ARGUING ABOUT IS OWNING TYPE ISSUE. WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED THAT A BILL THAT THIS BILL PICKETT SIGNED -- GETS UP DOWNSTAIRS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GET SIGNED. THAT IS REALLY NOT GONNA LEAD TO MORE HOUSING GOING IN BECAUSE WE HAVE. A LOT OF A GROWERS ARE JUST NOT GOING TO TURN THE KEYS OVER IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE MINISTER PERMITTING PROCESS. AND WE COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND SAY WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THE PROBLEM -- THAT WE'RE STILL HAVING A A FORMER HOUSING SHORTAGE OF THAT WERE UNFORTUNATE TO BE TOLD THAT WE TRY TO DRESS AT LAST YEAR AND WE'RE WORRIED. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS REALLY A CRISIS AND WE LIKE OUR HANDS ARE BEING TIED UNNECESSARILY. THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS ONLY MY MY THIRTY YEAR ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND I FEEL LIKE WE CONTINUE TO BRING TOOLS KNOWING THAT NOT ONE TOOL IS THE FINAL SOLUTION. SO I GUESS THERE'S AN EXPECTATION ON MY PART THAT WE WILL COME BACK NEXT YEAR INDEPENDENT OF THIS BILL GET SIGNED OR NOT BECAUSE WE NEED MORE THAN ONE TOOL FOR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- AND CERTAINLY THIS ISSUE AT I THINK BOTH THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION MENTON THE CENTRAL COAST WHICH IS -- THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND BOTH ENTER AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAVE AG AG IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THOSE COUNTIES -- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE AG ACCURATE AG PRODUCTION WITHOUT FARMWORKERS -- AND THE HOUSING ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE -- ONE I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS I AND THE OTHER THAT YOU KNOW ELEMENT THAT I'VE EXPRESSED AND IN TERMS OF MY CONCERN AND THIS HAS GONE FOR A NUMBER OF OF BILLS THAT WE'VE SEEN NOT JUST AROUND HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT OTHER DEVELOPMENT. IS WHEN WE FAST FORWARD -- OR STREAMLINER AT WHATEVER RATE. AT WORD OF THE DAY WE DECIDE -- SOME ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT -- THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN URBAN AND AG CREATES COMPLICATIONS. AND THERE ARE A I THINK HAVING LIVED AND CONTINUING TO LIVE SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS -- THAT IT CREATES -- I THINK WE DO HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO WHAT IT MEANS AT TO BUILD IN AN AREA -- WHERE URBAN AND NAGY INTERFACE -- WHERE IS THAT COMMUNITY CHANGES -- THE CONCERNS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT TODAY THAN THEY WILL BE IN TEN YEARS -- CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN THAT -- AND HAPPEN AND SO I I WANT. I WORRY SOMETIMES THAT WE FAST FORWARD OR STREAMLINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS -- IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING DONE BECAUSE THE NEED IS SO HIGH AND I THINK THERE'S MERIT IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION BUT PARTICULARLY AROUND FARM WORKER HOUSING. IN COMMUNITIES WHERE AG AND URBAN INTERFACE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN IN RURAL COMMUNITIES -- I I WORRY I ALSO WORRY -- I KNOW THAT DEPENDING ON THE SIDE THAT PEOPLE ARE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND REVIEW PROCESS CAN BE USED AS A SORT FOR BOTH SIDES. AND I ALSO FIND THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE ON THE NOT SO GREAT RECEIVING SIDE OF THIS -- IT MEANING THAT SOMETIMES WE OVER RIGHT PROTECTIONS -- Là AND WE FIND OURSELVES THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE IN AREAS WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY WITH -- WATER ISSUES WITH LAND CONTAMINATION ISSUES BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ELEMENTS THAT WERE FAST FORWARDED -- AND I ALSO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT TO PROTECTIONS. THAT CAN BE USED -- BY FOLKS. WHO HAVE DIFFERENT CONCERNS IN MINE AND AND SLOWED YOU KNOW IN COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY? TO BUILD HOUSING AND ALSO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY -- AGAIN I WOULD BE HAPPY HAVE CONVERSATIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE BOTH OPPOSITION -- AND SUPPORTERS TALKED ABOUT THE CENTRAL COAST IT'S HARD SOMETIMES -- MAY AND IT'S HARD FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BECAUSE THE ONE A ONE MIGHT NOT BE THERE IN FIFTY YEARS IF WE DO SEE SEA LEVEL RISE ENTRANCE -- TATIAN WILL BE AN ISSUE -- BECAUSE WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO NATURAL DISASTERS -- SINCE WE HAVE A FEW NO NATIONAL FOREST SURROUNDING US -- IT IN SO I WANT THOSE TO BE CONSIDERED -- I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS SOMEONE WHO CARES A LOT ABOUT THE SAME THINGS AND AND THAT HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL -- AND CERTAINLY -- I A THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY -- AND ESTABLISH THAT THIS COULD BE ONE TOOL -- EIGHT YOU KNOW IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS -- BUT THIS WON'T BE THE BE ALL AND SOLVE ALL -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WILL BE EVALUATING AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD WHERE I'M AT I THINK CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE -- BUT I DO HOPE THAT WE INCLUDE SOME OF THE MORE YOU KNOW THE EASIER QUESTIONS ARE THE THE THE FIRST THAT WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ANSWERED BUT THERE SOME HARDER WHEN -- AS WELL [inaudible] MR STONE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU A SERVICE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. YOU AND I ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS AND I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT AND LOG YOUR GOALS TO GET MORE FORMER HOUSING WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. AND AS BOTH OF US BE REPRESENT AS OF THE NORTHERN END OF THE CENTRAL COAST. JUST LOOKING FOR THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT'S THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CRITICAL BUT I WILL ALSO. SO MY CONCERNS THOUGH ARE THIS NOTION OF STREAMLINING WE WE HAVE ARE STARTING TO CREATE THIS NOTION THAT SEQUEL IS THE THE ANSWER GETTING RID OF SEEK OR DOING SOME BASIC WAS THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEMS. STATISTICALLY THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE IT'S BECOME AN UNNECESSARY WHIPPING. BOY TO THE PROCESS HERE AND IF THAT'S OUR FOCUS I THINK WE FORGET THE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO BE DOING. BY CREATING PROJECTS LIKE THIS AS MINISTERIAL PERMITS WE WHAT IS REALLY BEING DONE IS WE'RE TAKING THE PUBLIC PROCESS IS SICK OR PRESENTS. OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. AND THERE. WAS A RECENT VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT THAT YOU KNOW WOULD IN SPRECKELS THAT. WENT THROUGH THAT FULL PROCESS NOW THAT IS ONE THAT IS BEING RUN BY THE GROWER THAT'S NOT A PART OF YOUR BILL THAT I HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH YOUR I WILL I WILL DEFINITELY SUPPORTER THAT. BUT IT WENT THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND THE GROWER THERE THE DEVELOPER WAS VERY SMART AND HOW. THEY ENGAGED THE THE FOLKS WHO TYPICALLY PUSHED BACK AND WANT TO PROTECT SEQUIN ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT DEVELOPMENT. THAT ACTUALLY GOT ENTITLED FAIRLY QUICKLY AND WITHOUT A LOT OF GRIEF AND PAIN BECAUSE THEY DID THE WORK UP FRONT WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE FOUND IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ELECTED. IS WHAT LEADS TO SEE WHAT PROBLEMS IS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO DO THE WORK UP FRONT TO TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS AND TO TO BUILD. THAT THE CASE FOR DEVELOPMENT SO THE PART THAT WORRIES ME IS THIS CREATION OF A MINISTERIAL PROCESS FOR THAT WHICH THIS YEAR IF THIS GOES THROUGH. OF TAKING THE PUBLIC OF OUT OF A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK. THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING THAT ALMOST SOME PLACES GUARANTEES FURTHER STRIFE DOWN THE LINE AND MORE LAWSUITS AROUND IT BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS ARE NOT AS INCLINED. TO ENGAGE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN BE OPPONENTS TO A PROJECT OR OR WHO WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT. SO I I WOULD JUST ASK I'M I'M A GUEST HERE TODAY AND I RECOGNIZE THAT I'M GONNA DEFINITELY FOLLOW THE CHAIR ON INDIAN. BUT I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD HAD ASKED TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT THAT MOVING FORWARD AND NOT CREATING A PROCESS THAT EXCLUDES LEGITIMATE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN A LOT OF THE DECISIONS THAT GET MADE. ABOUT WHERE HOUSING GOES WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND IT'S THAT SEQUEL PROCESS THAT ENFORCES. THE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THEM BECAUSE THOSE PRIDE THAT PROJECT AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT'S PROPOSING CASTRO ABOUT. SOME OF THE COMMUNITY CONCERNS THERE ARE WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IF THEY'RE GONNA BE SOARED WILL BERWICK STYLE IF YOU THEY'RE JUST HOUSING PEOPLE HOUSE PEOPLE THOSE ISSUES OF ALL COME UP. AND THE DEVELOPER REALLY HAD TO ADDRESS THOSE. BANKRATE ENVIRONMENT RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S THE THE NATURE OF FARMWORKERS WHO THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE FAMILIES THAT THEY HAVE BROADER NEEDS. THAN HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE PAST BECAME A VERY GOOD PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE THOSE ASPECTS OF IT IN A RUSH TO GET HOUSING DONE. WHICH WE SHOULD BE DOING AND I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THERE ARE SOME PROCESSES WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF THAT WE'RE NOT OVERSTEPPING AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HASN'T ALWAYS PROVEN TO BE. A STUMBLING BLOCK I THINK WE PRESUME A STUMBLING BLOCK WHERE THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY ONE AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET OVER SOME OF THE CHALLENGE TO GET BROUGHT UP BUT THANK YOU. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND AND CLEARLY I AND COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE YOU KNOW. MYSELF MY STAFF THAT WOULD CONTINUE THE WORK WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL -- THE COMMUNITY WITH AND AND AND CERTAINLY WITH WITH -- YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU AND AND MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CONTINUE STRAIGHT AND THIS BILL FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW I THAT'S SOMETHING I'M REALLY OPEN TO A BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- AND YOU KNOW I I I I SHOULD MENTION THAT. IN THE SALINAS VALLEY I COMMAND -- WE'RE VERY CLOSELY WITH WITH WITH AGRICULTURE THERE ON THIS BILL. AND YOU ASIDE FROM THE COMMENTS FROM -- YOU KNOW MY FRIEND FROM WATCHING GROWERS. YOU KNOW THEY REALLY AG THOSE AG. I COMPANIES AG OPERATES HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND TO CREATE DECENT HOUSING FOR ALL WORKERS -- IN IN IN THIS REGION -- AND THAT SHOULD BE NOTED I WOULD ALSO SHOULD BE NOTED ON THE LARGER FARMS THE OPERATION THAT MR STONE ELUDED -- TO WHAT WHAT WITH WHICH WAS BY TEN MARIN ANTEL -- WHICH WAS INTENDED TO BE AN H. TO A PROJECT. BUT LO AND BEHOLD PART OF OUR BILL YOU KNOW A BIG PART OF OUR BILLS AGAIN THIS IS A TOOL AND PART OF THAT TOOL IS RECRUITING AND HOPEFULLY STABILIZING AG LABOR IN THE STATE. LOW AND BEHOLD WHEN YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS AGE TO A INTENDED HOUSING PROJECT IS NO LONGER IN AGE TO A PROJECT IS A PERMANENT PROJECT FOUR EIGHT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN THEY BUILT IT STABILIZED THEIR LABOR NEEDS -- AT TI NA AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO INTEND YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S A IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OPTION BUT IT IS A TOOL AND WE THINK THAT IT'LL GO A LONG WAY. TO ADDRESS NEEDS FROM LOCAL FARMERS. IS THERE ARE OTHER DISCUSSION LIKE MANY. MOTION MOVED THERE'S A SECOND -- I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS -- THIS COMMITTEE SPENDS AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO EXPAND. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND URBAN AREAS AND SUBURBAN AREAS BUT WE DO NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME THINKING OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN A RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND FARM WORKER HOUSING -- BEFORE I GOT TO KNOW THE AUTHOR SINCE HE IS NEW HERE -- I WAS ASKED TO CARRY SOME OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WERE IN THIS BILL. AND WHEN I DISCOVERED -- NOT ONLY AUTHORS BACKGROUND AND HIS PERSONAL COMMITMENT AS PASSION -- I WAS I AM VERY VERY HAPPY -- THAT THIS BILL IS MOVING FORWARD AND REALLY TRAINING CORPORATION A NUMBER OF OF THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS AREA FROM CREATING MORE INCENTIVES TO BUILD THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED. TO CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT ALLOWED THAT HAD ALLOWED THE STATE TO SPEND OUR LIMITED HOUSING RESOURCES ON HOUSING -- THE FARMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AS WELL AS ENSURING SOME PROTECTIONS FOR FARMWORKERS WHO ARE TENANTS -- AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I AM RECOMMENDING AND HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS FOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS BILL TO REALLY BE THE VEHICLE FOR THIS CONVERSATION. I CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE ARE CONTINUED ISSUES IN MY HOPE IS -- THAT EVERYONE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER THAT WE REALLY USE THIS BILL TO SURFACE THE BEST IDEAS AND HOW WE MOVE THIS FORWARD. IT ALSO SO I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS VERY COMMITTED -- TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE NOT WE CAN IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS -- AND WILL WORK ON THAT -- SO WITH THAT -- IF THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE I'M ALSO HAPPY BE ADDED AS AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT WERE ASKED FOR IN THIS COMMITTEE SO MRS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. LET ME ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL COMMENTS -- I DO IN AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I REMAIN ABSOLUTELY -- COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL SIDES IN AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THIS ISSUE -- AND WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW MY STAFF MYSELF WE'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TRANSPARENT IN THIS PROCESS AND WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN RESPECT ON THIS MATTER. OF I WANT TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT HERE AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL AB SEVENTY THREE SIMPLY CREATE A TOOL AN OPTION. FOR FARMERS TO UTILIZE IF THEY'RE WILLING AND ABLE -- AND I I IMPLORE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL ARE FARMWORKERS CERTAINLY NEED OUR HELP.
