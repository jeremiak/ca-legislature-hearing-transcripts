ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:26.011 region:rollup2
WE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:28.147 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AFFECTED.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.448 region:rollup2
BY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES

00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:30.849 region:rollup2
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:32.651 region:rollup2
ISKRATEL OF ALLEY.

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:34.653 region:rollup2
SO WE WORK ON A WHOLE RANGE OF

00:27:32.651 --> 00:27:36.221 region:rollup2
ISSUES RANGING FROM AFFORDABLE

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.422 region:rollup2
HOUSING TO AND.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:38.323 region:rollup2

DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER

00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:42.961 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:27:41.193 --> 00:27:44.696 region:rollup2
UP SO FIRST I'D LIKE. I'D LIKE

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.831 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.799 region:rollup2
GENERAL TRENDS REGARDING

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:49.968 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:51.570 region:rollup2
BETTER. SO AS WE KNOW THERE ARE

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:52.905 region:rollup2
ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.306 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO A RELIABLE SOURCE OF

00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:57.176 region:rollup2
CLEAN DRINKING WATER TODAY AND

00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:58.043 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONLY. ON ON PUBLIC WATER

00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:59.678 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND THAT'S NOT EVEN

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:01.547 region:rollup2
INCLUDING FOLKS ON DOMESTIC

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:04.583 region:rollup2
WELLS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY.

00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:06.285 region:rollup2
AND THERE AS AS AS WE KNOW THERE

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:09.288 region:rollup2
TWO SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER.

00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:10.589 region:rollup2
SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.990 region:rollup2
AND THE DROUGHT.

00:28:10.589 --> 00:28:13.458 region:rollup2
HAS EXACERBATED OUR LACK OF

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:16.328 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:18.363 region:rollup2
FROM BOTH SOURCES AND WE HAVE

00:28:16.328 --> 00:28:19.298 region:rollup2
LESS REPORT RELIABLE SUPPLY AID

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:21.533 region:rollup2
TO TO OVER PUMPING OF

00:28:19.298 --> 00:28:22.768 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER IN LESS SURFACE

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:24.903 region:rollup2
WATER. ON.

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:26.772 region:rollup2
AND. AS A RESULT MORE

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:27.973 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION OF CONTAMINANTS AS

00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:30.709 region:rollup2
OFTEN AQUIFER IS OURS ARE

00:28:27.973 --> 00:28:32.144 region:rollup2
DEPLETED. AND THIS LEADS TO AT

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.679 region:rollup2
THIS AND OTHER ISSUES LEAD TO

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:35.214 region:rollup2
INCREASED COSTS OF WATER DUE TO

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:35.881 region:rollup2
LACK OF SUPPLY AND CONTAMINATION

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:37.683 region:rollup2
OF WATER.

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:40.218 region:rollup2
AND.

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.653 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE HISTORICAL KEPT THE

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:44.423 region:rollup2
CONTEXT IN THE CITY AND THE SAN

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:45.924 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND OF DRINKING

00:28:44.423 --> 00:28:47.993 region:rollup2
WATER AND CLAIM ISSUES AND

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:48.961 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. IS THAT

00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:50.829 region:rollup2
LAND USING GROUND WATER

00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:52.097 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT HAVE NOT TAKEN INTO

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.899 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT DISADVANTAGED

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:57.002 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. ARM OR WATER

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:58.236 region:rollup2
RESOURCES OR CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:28:57.002 --> 00:29:00.505 region:rollup2
AS THEY SHOULD.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:02.474 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE DEPLETED GROUND WATER

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:04.776 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES AND FROM AN INCREASED

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.844 region:rollup2
FOCUS AS CONTINUED FOCUS ON

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:07.412 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:09.081 region:rollup2
URBAN DEVELOPMENT. WITHOUT

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:10.682 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF DISADVANTAGED

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:10.983 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES DRINKING WATER NEEDS

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:14.086 region:rollup2
AND WHAT.

00:29:10.983 --> 00:29:15.287 region:rollup2
THAT VITAL WATER RESOURCES.

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:17.089 region:rollup2
AND NOW THAT LEADS TO A

00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:18.323 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE MANY CITIES ARE

00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:19.558 region:rollup2
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR LIMITED

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:21.860 region:rollup2
WATER CAPACITY THAT GIVES THEM

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:23.061 region:rollup2
LESS OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.230 region:rollup2
THEIR WATER SYSTEMS OUT TO CAN

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:27.265 region:rollup2
USE TO. LACK CLEAN AND

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.833 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AND SAFE DRINKING

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.901 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:31.570 region:rollup2
AND.

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:33.572 region:rollup2
AND THERE HAS BEEN REALLY IN THE

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.507 region:rollup2
PAST VERY LITTLE CONTROLS ON

00:29:33.572 --> 00:29:36.308 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER PUMPING. AND ONLY A

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.342 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY GROUND WATER

00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:39.177 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE IRWIN

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:41.980 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:42.914 region:rollup2
AND. AS NOTED BEFORE THE

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.082 region:rollup2
COMMUTE DISADVANTAGED

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:45.450 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE CONTINUALLY

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:47.052 region:rollup2
EXCLUDED FROM THE MUNICIPAL

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.320 region:rollup2
DRINKING WATER SERVICES.

00:29:47.052 --> 00:29:50.122 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO KIND OF BRING

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.957 region:rollup2
THIS DOWN TO A LEVEL OF

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:52.758 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORKED

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:54.493 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY WITH THAT I WORKED

00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:56.361 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY WITH IN THE COUNTY OF.

00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:57.796 region:rollup2
FRESNO AND FIRST TOMBSTONE

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:59.998 region:rollup2
TERRITORY.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.732 region:rollup2
IS A COMMUNITY JUST SOUTH OF

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:04.336 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF SAYING.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:05.504 region:rollup2
A THEY ARE ON DOMESTIC WELLS

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:07.506 region:rollup2
AND THEIR DOMESTIC WELLS ARE

00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:09.775 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED WITH NITRATES AND

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:11.443 region:rollup2
ONE TWO THREE TCP IT AS WELL AS

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:15.814 region:rollup2
BACK TO CHLOROFORM BACTERIA.

00:30:11.443 --> 00:30:16.848 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THEIR HOMES HAVE

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:18.784 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:20.285 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY LACKED A ADEQUATE

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:21.920 region:rollup2
SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER SOAKED

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:23.622 region:rollup2
THEIR WEALTH OF GONE DRIVE.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.757 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY OVER THE LAST.

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:26.625 region:rollup2
THREE OUR YEARS AND MANY FOLKS

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:28.694 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE

00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:30.529 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND MANY HAVE HAD TO

00:30:28.694 --> 00:30:31.229 region:rollup2
GET WATER FROM HOSES FROM THEIR

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:33.231 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS.

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:35.167 region:rollup2
AND.

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:36.601 region:rollup2
SINCE THERE IS A LIMITED GROUND

00:30:35.167 --> 00:30:37.903 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY IN THE VALLEY OF

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:39.538 region:rollup2
THE NEIGHBORING CITY OF SANGER

00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:40.706 region:rollup2
IS VERY HESITANT TO EXTEND THEIR

00:30:39.538 --> 00:30:42.474 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:30:40.706 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
LIMITED WATER CAPACITY.

00:30:42.474 --> 00:30:45.010 region:rollup2
THEN ANOTHER COMMUNITY CALLED

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:47.279 region:rollup2
COME TO A CREEK.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.313 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S NEARING ITS

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:49.815 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS AND AND PUT AN EVEN

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:51.550 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO ON A THEY'RE ON A

00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:53.285 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. THAT

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.486 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY RECEIVES THEIR SOURCE

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.921 region:rollup2
OF WATER FROM THEM WHAT FUNDS

00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:58.490 region:rollup2
WATER DISTRICT AT THROUGH THEIR

00:30:55.921 --> 00:31:00.892 region:rollup2
SURFACE WATER CANALS. AND DUE TO

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.060 region:rollup2
THE DROUGHT AND DUE TO FLATTEN

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.829 region:rollup2
THAT DO THE DROUGHT THERE'S BEEN

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.731 region:rollup2
MANY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:07.299 region:rollup2
OF WATER. LEADING TO SOME

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:09.601 region:rollup2
FAMILIES HAVING TO PAY TWO

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:10.502 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH FOR

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.404 region:rollup2
THEIR WATER BILLS.

00:31:10.502 --> 00:31:13.739 region:rollup2
AND IN TWENTY TEN THEIR BILLS

00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:15.607 region:rollup2
INCREASED DRASTICALLY AND THEY

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:17.476 region:rollup2
COULDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS THE

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:19.144 region:rollup2
COUNTY OF FRESNO ACTUALLY AND.

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:20.746 region:rollup2
THAT THREATENED TO CUT OFF THEIR

00:31:19.144 --> 00:31:22.214 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY BECAUSE THEY

00:31:20.746 --> 00:31:23.682 region:rollup2
COULDN'T PAY THEIR THEIR WATER

00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:25.484 region:rollup2
BILLS AND THEN THE STATE.

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:26.385 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WAS ABLE TO

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:28.954 region:rollup2
INTERVENE.

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:30.422 region:rollup2
GAVE THE COMMUNITY A GRANT AND

00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:31.723 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY STARTED LOOKING INTO

00:31:30.422 --> 00:31:33.625 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A NEW GROUND WATER

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.960 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEM WHICH LATER I'LL

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.094 region:rollup2
GET INTO SOME COMPLICATIONS THAT

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.163 region:rollup2
MIGHT COME FROM THAT. SO THE

00:31:36.094 --> 00:31:39.765 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT WE SEE GIVEN THE

00:31:38.163 --> 00:31:41.066 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT I'VE MENTIONED SO

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:43.401 region:rollup2
FAR ARE FIVE.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:45.070 region:rollup2
ONE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:46.204 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.606 region:rollup2
WATER MANAGEMENT ACT.

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:49.408 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN

00:31:47.606 --> 00:31:51.176 region:rollup2
ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OVER

00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:51.810 region:rollup2
GROUNDWATER PUMPING IN THE

00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:53.445 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE REALLY

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.113 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE NEED TO. TO SCALE

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:57.048 region:rollup2
IT BACK AND LOOK AT OUR OUR

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:58.784 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLY AND HOW WE CAN AND

00:31:57.048 --> 00:32:01.186 region:rollup2
IS THAT BETTER.

00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:02.654 region:rollup2
ALSO ACT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:04.356 region:rollup2
SIGMA.

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:06.324 region:rollup2
AND GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:08.026 region:rollup2
PLAN DEVELOPMENT. WE NEED TO

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:09.394 region:rollup2
ENSURE AS A STATE BUT

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:10.695 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NEEDS

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:11.496 region:rollup2
ARE TAKEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.697 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.232 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT OUT OF

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:14.766 region:rollup2

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:18.303 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:20.472 region:rollup2
TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:22.307 region:rollup2
ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT THEIR NEEDS

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:23.909 region:rollup2
ARE MET BY SUSTAINABILITY COUNTY

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:25.510 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. BUT

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:27.879 region:rollup2
THERE'S AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.413 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY WON'T BE.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.214 region:rollup2

TO A GROUND WATER SYSTEM WHICH

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:49.020 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A MORE SUSTAINABLE

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:49.721 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF WATER. IF THE

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.989 region:rollup2

HOWEVER.

00:35:11.576 --> 00:35:14.679 region:rollup2
THAT'S IT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:15.947 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE GROUND

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:17.182 region:rollup2

00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:33.258 region:rollup2
DOING TO ADDRESS THESE RISKS AND

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.125 region:rollup2
OUR WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:36:33.258 --> 00:36:36.127 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO START OUT WITH A

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:37.729 region:rollup2
FEW POINTS ON WHY PUBLIC HEALTH

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:39.597 region:rollup2
IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:41.1000 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE WORK. LOCAL

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:42.567 region:rollup2
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN PARTICULAR

00:36:41.1000 --> 00:36:44.102 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.503 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM THE

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:46.838 region:rollup2
HEALTH IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:48.740 region:rollup2
CHANGES ALL DESCRIBED.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:50.075 region:rollup2
AND AND ALSO RESEARCH SHOWS US

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.043 region:rollup2
THAT TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE

00:36:50.075 --> 00:36:53.344 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:54.679 region:rollup2
IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.748 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE IT SO THAT PEOPLE

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:59.084 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT IT. AND CONCERN OVER

00:36:56.748 --> 00:37:01.052 region:rollup2
HEALTH IS UNIVERSAL AND

00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:02.587 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL. AND

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:05.023 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:07.559 region:rollup2
PAST HAS HAS BEEN PORTRAYED AS

00:37:05.023 --> 00:37:09.928 region:rollup2
RELATING TO YOU ICE CAPS AND SAT

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:11.663 region:rollup2
AND POLAR BEARS AND. THOSE WALL

00:37:09.928 --> 00:37:14.432 region:rollup2
SAT AREN'T IN MEDIA AND PERSONAL

00:37:11.663 --> 00:37:16.000 region:rollup2
TO MOST PEOPLE ON HEALTH IS BOTH

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:18.303 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE AND PERSONAL.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.171 region:rollup2
ANOTHER REASON AND PUBLIC HEALTH

00:37:18.303 --> 00:37:21.740 region:rollup2
IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT I IN

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.608 region:rollup2
THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT CLIMATE

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.310 region:rollup2
CHANGE SOLUTIONS BRING ABOUT

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:27.112 region:rollup2
POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.246 region:rollup2
AND SO CLIMATE SOLUTIONS ARE AT

00:37:27.112 --> 00:37:30.315 region:rollup2
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:32.684 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY TO CREATE

00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:34.886 region:rollup2
A HEALTHIER MORE RESILIENT AND

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:37.355 region:rollup2
MORE EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES.

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:39.124 region:rollup2
SO BROADLY IN THE LOS ANGELES

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:40.358 region:rollup2
REGION OUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS

00:37:39.124 --> 00:37:41.793 region:rollup2
OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE'RE

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:44.395 region:rollup2
EXPECTING INCLUDE HOTTER

00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:45.530 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES. WORST AIR QUALITY

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:48.066 region:rollup2
AND MORE ACRES BURNED BY

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:50.168 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES MORE FLOODING AND

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:51.903 region:rollup2
WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND VECTOR

00:37:50.168 --> 00:37:53.638 region:rollup2
BORNE DISEASE. HAS ASKED TO

00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:56.274 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON EXTREME HEAT AS AN

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:57.909 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. AND WE'RE EXPECTING THE

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:59.677 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF EXTREME HEAT DAYS IN

00:37:57.909 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO INCREASE

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:03.047 region:rollup2
BY ABOUT TWO TO FOUR TIMES BY

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:04.716 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY. THOSE

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:06.851 region:rollup2
ARE DEFINED AS STAYS OVER NINETY

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:08.520 region:rollup2
FIVE DEGREES SO WE'LL SEE TWO TO

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:09.721 region:rollup2
FOUR TIMES AS MANY DAYS OVER

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.723 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE DEGREES.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:13.258 region:rollup2
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY AS

00:38:11.723 --> 00:38:14.793 region:rollup2
WE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE.

00:38:13.258 --> 00:38:16.394 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:18.296 region:rollup2
HEALTH CONCERN BECAUSE EXTREME

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:20.431 region:rollup2
HEAT OF FUNDS ALREADY IN THE U.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:22.233 region:rollup2
S. CAUSE MORE DEATHS EACH YEAR

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:24.269 region:rollup2
THAN FLOODS STORMS AND LIGHTNING

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:25.970 region:rollup2
COMBINES. AND IN TWO THOUSAND

00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:27.605 region:rollup2
SIX CALIFORNIA HAD A HEAT WAVE

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.940 region:rollup2
THAT LED TO OVER SIX HUNDRED AND

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:30.875 region:rollup2
FIFTY DEATHS.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.410 region:rollup2
AND AND BECAUSE HE ALSO PLACES

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:34.112 region:rollup2
STRESS ON THE BODY IT

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.980 region:rollup2
EXACERBATES EXISTING MEDICAL

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:38.249 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.717 region:rollup2
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. AYE

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES SO WE

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:42.787 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY SEE MORE EMERGENCY

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.055 region:rollup2
ROOM VISITS DURING EXTREME HEAT

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:45.190 region:rollup2
OF FANS.

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:47.125 region:rollup2
AND DURING CALIFORNIA'S TWO

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.827 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIX HEATWAVE WE SAW

00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:50.495 region:rollup2
MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND

THOUSAND ACCESS HOSPITALIZATIONS

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.968 region:rollup2

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:03.441 region:rollup2
WE ALSO I HAVE NOTED AT THAT IN

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:05.043 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE SEEING

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:07.278 region:rollup2
AND NON FATAL EMERGENCY ROOM

00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:09.080 region:rollup2
VISITS FOR HEAT RELATED ILLNESS.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:10.748 region:rollup2
INCREASING NOT SINCE ABOUT TWO

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.116 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE.

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:13.518 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:15.720 region:rollup2
PROJECTS

00:39:13.518 --> 00:39:17.021 region:rollup2
I HEAT RELATED ILLNESS IMPACTS

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.090 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.758 region:rollup2
SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.627 region:rollup2
CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS.

ACCLIMATISATION ABOUT RESEARCH

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.767 region:rollup2
IT CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT WELL

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:31.169 region:rollup2
THAT WE'LL BE SEEING MORE HE

CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:37.508 region:rollup2

AND DUE TO THEN THAT'S URBAN

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:14.712 region:rollup2
HEAT ISLAND A FACTS PEOPLE

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:16.648 region:rollup2

ENVIRONMENTS.

00:40:25.857 --> 00:40:31.763 region:rollup2
I IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE.

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:33.331 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ONLY ABOUT HALF OF OUR

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:34.699 region:rollup2

POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIVING IN

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:40.605 region:rollup2
URBAN HEAT ISLANDS. I WOULD ALSO

00:40:38.403 --> 00:40:42.573 region:rollup2
LACKEY AIR CONDITIONING.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:44.208 region:rollup2
EXTREME HEAT IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:45.443 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT NOT JUST

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:47.645 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HEAT RELATED ILLNESS

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:49.647 region:rollup2
AND DEATH NOT JUST BECAUSE OF

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:51.416 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT IT EXACERBATES

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:53.451 region:rollup2
EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS. BUT

00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:55.420 region:rollup2
ALSO BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES TO

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:57.322 region:rollup2
OTHER AND NEGATIVE HEALTH

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.389 region:rollup2
RELATED IMPACTS SO.

00:40:57.322 --> 00:41:00.158 region:rollup2
STREAM HEAT INCREASES THE

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:02.026 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATIONS OF GROUND LEVEL

00:41:00.158 --> 00:41:04.262 region:rollup2
OZONE WHICH IS A MAJOR COMPONENT

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:05.663 region:rollup2
OF SMOG THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH

00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:07.365 region:rollup2
POOR RESPIRATORY OUTCOMES. SO

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:09.100 region:rollup2
EXTREME HEAT CONTRIBUTES TO

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:11.302 region:rollup2
DECLINING AIR QUALITY.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.704 region:rollup2
AND EXTREME HE COMBINED WITH

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:14.472 region:rollup2

TURN FURTHER DID AND DETERIORATE

00:41:20.011 --> 00:41:24.248 region:rollup2
OUR AIR QUALITY.

00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:26.250 region:rollup2
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT UP LOW

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:27.118 region:rollup2
INCOME POPULATIONS AND

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.487 region:rollup2

00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:33.558 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:34.959 region:rollup2
BY CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

CASE OF EXTREME HEAT PAT LOW

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.562 region:rollup2
INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:38.930 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE MORE

00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:40.698 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO LIVE IN URBAN HEAT

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.066 region:rollup2

THEM SENSITIVE TO HEAT I LIKE

00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:49.907 region:rollup2
DIABETES. AND THEY'RE LESS

LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO CENTRAL

00:41:49.907 --> 00:41:52.176 region:rollup2
AIR CONDITIONING THAT WOULD MAKE

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:54.645 region:rollup2
IT EASIER.

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.713 region:rollup2
TO ADAPT TO EXTREME HEAT OF

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:57.281 region:rollup2
FANS AND THAT THESE

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:58.516 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THAT

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.917 region:rollup2
ARE FACED BY A LOW INCOME

HEALTH AND OTHER DISPARITIES.

00:42:08.426 --> 00:42:11.896 region:rollup2
SO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE

00:42:09.794 --> 00:42:13.464 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:15.500 region:rollup2

00:42:21.806 --> 00:42:25.777 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES. WE CONVENE OTHER

00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:28.446 region:rollup2
COUNTY DEPARTMENTS DURING A HEAT

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:31.315 region:rollup2
WAVE AND TO ORGANIZE THE OPENING

00:42:28.446 --> 00:42:32.717 region:rollup2
OF COOLING CENTERS AND WE

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:35.253 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE PUBLIC INFORMATION.

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:37.055 region:rollup2
BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT UP THAT HE

00:42:35.253 --> 00:42:38.122 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE TACKLED IN A VARIETY

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:39.857 region:rollup2
OF WAYS IN THAT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:42.360 region:rollup2
EXPECTING MORE EXTREME HEAT LEAN

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:43.895 region:rollup2
INTO. CONTINUE TO DO MORE TO

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.196 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE PUBLIC.

00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:46.064 region:rollup2
AND SO I DISCUSS THE FACT THAT

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.398 region:rollup2
THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND IS

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:49.133 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIALLY INCREASING

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:50.468 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES AND CITIES.

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.936 region:rollup2
SO ONE THING THE LA COUNTY

00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:53.104 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:54.572 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING IS WORKING WITH OUR

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.140 region:rollup2
FELLOW COUNTY DEPARTMENTS LIKE

00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:57.608 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WORKS AND REGIONAL

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.944 region:rollup2
PLANNING. AND PARKS AND

00:42:57.608 --> 00:43:02.713 region:rollup2
RECREATION ON AN URBAN HEAT

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:04.916 region:rollup2
ISLAND REDUCTION PLAN. AND FATS

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:06.017 region:rollup2
HAS VARIOUS ACTION ITEMS THAT

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:07.618 region:rollup2
HELP REDUCE THE URBAN HEAT

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:09.821 region:rollup2
ISLANDS OF FACTS AND ARE OUR

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:11.355 region:rollup2
MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:13.891 region:rollup2
AND THIS PLAN IS COMPOSED OF

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:15.827 region:rollup2
FOUR STRATEGIES. SO COOL ROOFS

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:17.662 region:rollup2
QUAN PAVEMENTS TREES AND GREEN

00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:18.596 region:rollup2
SPACE.

00:43:17.662 --> 00:43:20.631 region:rollup2
WHEN URBAN HEAT ISLAND IT ACTION

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.066 region:rollup2
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STRATEGY

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.935 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT'S AN

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:25.436 region:rollup2
UPS SORT OF AN UPSTREAM BUILT

00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:28.339 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT SOLUTION THAT HELPS

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:30.675 region:rollup2
PROMOTE EQUITY FOR EXAMPLE BY.

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:32.477 region:rollup2
INCREASING TREE CANOPY AND AND I

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:33.644 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT DON'T HAVE

00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:34.946 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TREE CANOPY AND GREEN

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:36.781 region:rollup2
SPACE.

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:37.949 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ON THE

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.317 region:rollup2
LANCET COMMISSION ON CLIMATE

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:41.252 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND HEALTH CALLS AND NO

00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:42.587 region:rollup2
REGRET. OPTION THESE ARE THINGS

00:43:41.252 --> 00:43:44.755 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:45.957 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A HEALTHIER MORE

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.692 region:rollup2
RESILIENT AND MORE EQUITABLE

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:50.261 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:51.629 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:53.164 region:rollup2
I WE HAS A LOCAL HEALTH

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:54.665 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:56.534 region:rollup2
INTO IN TERMS OF TACKLING

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:58.402 region:rollup2
EXTREME HEAT URBAN HEAT ISLAND

00:43:56.534 --> 00:44:00.138 region:rollup2
ACTION WILL HELP COOLER

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:02.240 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS. SHALL HELP UP

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:04.142 region:rollup2
LASSEN THAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.611 region:rollup2
FROM HEATS HELP REDUCE ENERGY

00:44:04.142 --> 00:44:07.845 region:rollup2
USAGE AND HOPEFULLY OFFSET SOME

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:09.447 region:rollup2
OF THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:10.648 region:rollup2
THAT WERE EXPECTING WITH CLIMATE

00:44:09.447 --> 00:44:11.916 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:13.417 region:rollup2
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN

00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:15.786 region:rollup2
PLAY MANY ROLES IN CLIMATE

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:18.222 region:rollup2
CHANGE. AND OR AND GENERALLY

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:19.557 region:rollup2
AMONG OTHER THINGS WE TRACTATE

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:21.526 region:rollup2
DATA ON DISEASE OCCURRENCE AND

00:44:19.557 --> 00:44:23.261 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WE

00:44:21.526 --> 00:44:24.896 region:rollup2
PROVIDE RISK ASSESSMENTS.

00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:26.998 region:rollup2
WHERE A TRUSTED SOURCE OF HEALTH

00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:29.700 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SO WE INFORM EDUCATE

00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:31.769 region:rollup2
AND EMPOWER COMMUNITIES AND

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.337 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKERS? WE HAVE A LOT

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:35.339 region:rollup2
OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:36.707 region:rollup2
CONVENE AND FACILITATOR LIKE

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:38.276 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING WITH THE URBAN HEAT

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:40.311 region:rollup2
ISLAND REDUCTION.

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:42.046 region:rollup2
SO WHAT OTHER CAN I GOVERNMENT

00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:43.814 region:rollup2
AGENCIES NON PROFITS AND

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:45.449 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:46.984 region:rollup2
WE DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOP AND

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:49.020 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT SAP PLANS FOR

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:50.087 region:rollup2
RESPONDING TO HEALTH THREATS WE

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.523 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF HIS FELLOW AND

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:54.325 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT. POLICIES THAT PROTECT

AND PROMOTE HEALTH WE WORK A LOT

00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:57.562 region:rollup2
WITH PARTNERS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY

00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.031 region:rollup2
BUILT ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE

00:44:57.562 --> 00:45:01.198 region:rollup2
ACTIVE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.600 region:rollup2
AND WE IMPLEMENT TERRAX

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:04.936 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS TO RESPOND TO

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.604 region:rollup2
HEALTH THREATS.

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:07.972 region:rollup2
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:09.507 region:rollup2
TRUSTED AND WE'RE REALLY ON THE

00:45:07.972 --> 00:45:11.709 region:rollup2
FRONT LINES OF OUR COMMUNITIES

00:45:09.507 --> 00:45:13.211 region:rollup2
AND OUR WELL SITUATED TO PLAY A

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:16.080 region:rollup2
LEADING ROLE IN MITIGATING AND

00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:18.015 region:rollup2
ADAPTING. AT TO CLIMATE CHANGE

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.318 region:rollup2
IN WAYS THAT PROMOTE RESILIENCE

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:22.053 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH UP BUT IN MANY CASES

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:24.188 region:rollup2
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:25.489 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY STAFFED AND RESORTS.

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:26.490 region:rollup2
AND TO UNDERTAKE THESE

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:28.392 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CLIMATE

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.328 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:31.662 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:34.065 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT STILL NEED TO BE

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
DONE AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.500 region:rollup2
OR NEED TO BE EXPANDED TO

PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THE

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.138 region:rollup2
HEALTH IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT.

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:43.641 region:rollup2
AND CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:45.509 region:rollup2
TRACK DATA ON CLIMATE RELATED

00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:46.577 region:rollup2
INDICATORS HAVE BOTH RELATED TO

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.912 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENTS AND DISEASE

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:50.014 region:rollup2
INCIDENCE.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:51.716 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY

00:45:50.014 --> 00:45:53.551 region:rollup2
FOR MODELING AND FORECASTING

00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:55.820 region:rollup2
HEALTH IMPACTS AND THEN. UP

00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:56.954 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR THOSE IMPACTS.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.023 region:rollup2
GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

00:45:56.954 --> 00:46:00.891 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE NEED

00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:02.827 region:rollup2
TO COPE WITH EXTREME HEAT AND

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:04.328 region:rollup2
THEN IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THAT

00:46:02.827 --> 00:46:05.963 region:rollup2
ASSISTS PEOPLE IN COPING WITH

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:07.498 region:rollup2
EXTREME HEATS.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:09.700 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:11.736 region:rollup2
IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:08.352 region:rollup2
IT HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

00:48:06.584 --> 00:48:10.121 region:rollup2
MILES OF SHORELINE IS ACTUALLY

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:12.156 region:rollup2
LARGER THAN THE CITY OF LOS

00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:13.791 region:rollup2
ANGELES ITSELF. BUT IT'S ALSO

00:48:12.156 --> 00:48:16.660 region:rollup2
VERY SHALLOW AND IS SURROUNDED

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:18.829 region:rollup2
BY HILLS SO FROM A PERSPECTIVE

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.698 region:rollup2
OF HOW WATER WORKS WHICH IS WHAT

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:22.399 region:rollup2
WE'RE INTERESTED IN HERE. IT'S

00:48:20.698 --> 00:48:25.302 region:rollup2
REALLY JUST A BIG BATHTUB WHICH

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:27.104 region:rollup2
CAN OVERFLOW PRETTY EASILY.

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:28.839 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:30.341 region:rollup2
WE THINK ABOUT IS FLOODING JUST

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:31.809 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU THINK ABOUT HEAT AND

00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:33.811 region:rollup2
YOU THINK ABOUT WATER WE THINK

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:36.347 region:rollup2
ABOUT WATER COMING INTO PEOPLE'S

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:38.349 region:rollup2
HOMES. INTO PEOPLE'S BUSINESSES

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:41.285 region:rollup2
PLACES OF WORSHIP AND THE LIKE.

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2
AND THAT FLOODING IS EXACERBATED

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:45.756 region:rollup2
BY RISING SEA LEVEL IN ADDITION

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:47.458 region:rollup2
TO THAT WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:49.093 region:rollup2
STORMS TIDES KING TIDES AND THE

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:50.995 region:rollup2
LIKE.

00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:53.197 region:rollup2
SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCIENCE

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:54.098 region:rollup2
IN THE SCIENCE AS WELL.

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:55.599 region:rollup2
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:57.434 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.969 region:rollup2
AGENCY LATEST REPORT.

00:48:57.434 --> 00:49:01.172 region:rollup2
WE BASICALLY NEED THE PLAN FOR

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:03.741 region:rollup2
TWO FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL IN

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:05.443 region:rollup2
THE BAY BY TWENTY FIFTY. AND

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:06.844 region:rollup2
FOUR FEET BY THE END OF THE

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
CENTURY ALTHOUGH IT CERTAINLY

00:49:06.844 --> 00:49:10.648 region:rollup2
CAN GO HIGHER DEPENDING UPON HOW

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.982 region:rollup2
THE ICE SHEETS ACTUALLY WORK.

00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:13.884 region:rollup2
AND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:16.187 region:rollup2
ARE PRETTY DRASTIC.

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:18.088 region:rollup2
I WOULD URGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK

00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:19.557 region:rollup2
IN YOUR LITTLE BLUE FOLDER.

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:21.025 region:rollup2
ONE PAGE AT A TIME IT'S SORT OF

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:22.193 region:rollup2
LIKE THE TEST THAT YOU TOOK IN

00:49:21.025 --> 00:49:23.794 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:26.530 region:rollup2
TO GO FREE THAT LED TO GO AHEAD.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:28.399 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY BASIC MAP OF WHAT

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.201 region:rollup2
WOULD HAPPEN.

00:49:28.399 --> 00:49:31.702 region:rollup2
IF THE BAY WERE ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:33.037 region:rollup2
TWO FEET HIGHER.

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:35.239 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S AN

00:49:33.037 --> 00:49:36.640 region:rollup2
AWFUL LOT OF BLUE AN AWFUL LOT

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:38.342 region:rollup2
OF GREEN AROUND THE BAY WHICH IS

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.077 region:rollup2
NOW DRY.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:43.214 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ON A PRETTY

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:44.582 region:rollup2
SUNNY BEAUTIFUL WINDLESS DAY

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:46.450 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A HIGH TIDE THAT IS A

00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:48.819 region:rollup2
KING TIED.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:50.621 region:rollup2
AND THE KEY HERE IS THAT SCORES

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:52.356 region:rollup2
OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES

00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:52.857 region:rollup2
AND BUSINESSES AND PLACES OF

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:55.459 region:rollup2
WORSHIP IN HOSPITALS AND

00:49:52.857 --> 00:49:58.162 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:59.463 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE HIT BY FLOODS.

00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:00.998 region:rollup2
AND FLOODING IS NOT SIMPLY A

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:02.533 region:rollup2
NUISANCE.

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.702 region:rollup2
FLOODING HAS TREMENDOUS PUBLIC

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:06.670 region:rollup2
HEALTH IMPLICATIONS IT HAS

00:50:04.702 --> 00:50:08.706 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:10.441 region:rollup2
DISLOCATION IMPLICATIONS.

00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:11.208 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THESE

00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:12.643 region:rollup2
NINE COUNTIES IN FORTY ONE

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:15.079 region:rollup2
CITIES

00:50:12.643 --> 00:50:16.680 region:rollup2
LED BY BC DC BECOME MORE

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:17.214 region:rollup2
RESILIENT SO THAT THEIR PEOPLE

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.649 region:rollup2
WHO LIVE THERE BECOME MORE

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:19.683 region:rollup2
RECENTLY.

00:50:18.649 --> 00:50:21.218 region:rollup2
AND TO PUT AN EVEN FINER POINT

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.686 region:rollup2
ON IT.

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:24.321 region:rollup2
WHILE MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT SAN

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:26.724 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO BAY NOW AND ADMIRE HOW

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:28.392 region:rollup2
BEAUTIFUL IT IS WHEN BC DC WAS

00:50:26.724 --> 00:50:29.760 region:rollup2
CREATED THE BAY WAS NOT

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:31.595 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S FRONT YARD. HE WAS

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.864 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S BACKYARD PEOPLE

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:35.332 region:rollup2
DUMPED IN THE BAY.

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:37.167 region:rollup2
THERE IT THERE ARE ARE JUST AND

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:39.103 region:rollup2
LARGE NUMBER OF DUMPS THAT HAVE

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:40.571 region:rollup2
NOW BEEN CAPPED WHICH MEANS THAT

00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:41.639 region:rollup2
IS FLAT MORE AND MORE FLOODING

00:50:40.571 --> 00:50:43.274 region:rollup2
OCCURS SLOWLY MORE AND MORE

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:46.076 region:rollup2
HEALTH RISKS.

00:50:43.274 --> 00:50:47.378 region:rollup2
SO WATER BE CDCS TASKS WELL

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.312 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE TO HELP LOCAL

00:50:47.378 --> 00:50:50.114 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND SPECIAL

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:52.116 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS REDUCE THAT RISK OF

00:50:50.114 --> 00:50:53.751 region:rollup2
FLOODING THROUGH BOTH PLANNING

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:55.586 region:rollup2
AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS

00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:57.555 region:rollup2
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BAY AND

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:59.056 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE.

00:50:57.555 --> 00:51:01.258 region:rollup2
SO THERE THREE ON THE GROUND

00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:03.060 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH BE CDC IS HELPING

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:04.094 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.063 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THIS THROUGH PLANNING

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:07.498 region:rollup2
ARE ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:09.266 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH IS A NATIONALLY

00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:10.501 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED PROGRAM OF PLANNING

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:12.269 region:rollup2
WHICH PUTS PEOPLE FIRST.

00:51:10.501 --> 00:51:14.171 region:rollup2
NOT HIGHWAYS.

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:16.206 region:rollup2
NOT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:17.141 region:rollup2
BUT ACTUALLY PEOPLE AND WE WORK

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:18.842 region:rollup2
WITHIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:20.644 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:22.546 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:24.381 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO THEM TO

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:26.350 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEIR RISK OF FLOODING.

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:28.118 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY HELPED FUND

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.653 region:rollup2
BY CALTRANS AND THE METROPOLITAN

00:51:28.118 --> 00:51:31.655 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:34.124 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALTRANS RECOGNIZES THAT

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:35.125 region:rollup2
IT'S HIGHWAYS AS LONG WITH

00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:36.860 region:rollup2
BART'S IN ALL THE OTHER

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:38.329 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS AND THE

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.997 region:rollup2
PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT AREAS IN

00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:41.799 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES AT RISK.

00:51:39.997 --> 00:51:42.800 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHICH ARE LOW INCOME

00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:45.035 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHICH ARE COMMUNITIES OF

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.437 region:rollup2
COLOR NEED THE ASSISTANCE.

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:47.638 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES IF YOU

00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.606 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE SECOND PAGE YOU'LL

00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:50.174 region:rollup2
SEE A BRIDGE THAT LOOKS PRETTY

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:52.176 region:rollup2
OLD.

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.978 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BRIDGE RIGHT

00:51:52.176 --> 00:51:55.579 region:rollup2
BEHIND EIGHTEEN T. BALLPARK

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:58.282 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE LEFTY O. DUAL BRIDGE

00:51:55.579 --> 00:52:01.085 region:rollup2
WHICH IS YOU CAN SEE ON.

00:51:58.282 --> 00:52:03.053 region:rollup2
A BASIC NICE DAY IS NOT THAT FAR

00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:04.288 region:rollup2
ABOVE WHERE THE WATER HITS.

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.723 region:rollup2
SO IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS IN

00:52:04.288 --> 00:52:07.925 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTY WITH YOU HAVE TO

00:52:05.723 --> 00:52:10.094 region:rollup2
FOUR FEET OF RISING SEA LEVEL

00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:12.129 region:rollup2
PLUS A STORM. PLUS A KING TIED

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:13.597 region:rollup2
WHICH IS GOING TO RAISE WHICH IS

00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:15.366 region:rollup2
GOING TO RAISE THE HIGH TIDE EN

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:16.800 region:rollup2
EL NINO WHICH CAN RAISE THE

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:18.002 region:rollup2
ELEVATION OF THE BAY BY AS MUCH

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.970 region:rollup2
AS TWO FEET.

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:23.073 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT THE NEXT PICTURE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.808 region:rollup2
THAT'S HAYWARD RIGHT NEXT TO THE

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:26.844 region:rollup2
DUMBARTON BRIDGE APPROACH ON THE

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:29.446 region:rollup2
BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS CLEAR BLUE

00:52:26.844 --> 00:52:32.149 region:rollup2
SKY DAY AND IT'S FLOODED.

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:33.083 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

00:52:32.149 --> 00:52:34.351 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:36.286 region:rollup2
NEXT FOUR SLIDES WHICH ARE

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:38.389 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER. THAT'S

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.323 region:rollup2
HOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE IN WILL

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:41.091 region:rollup2
MOURN HAPPY TO TALK TO STAFF IN

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:43.627 region:rollup2
YOU AND WHOEVER ABOUT IT. ABOUT

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:45.996 region:rollup2
HOW HE WOULD RESIDENTS USING BC

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:47.064 region:rollup2
DC IN OUR APPROACH WERE ABLE TO

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:50.000 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT FOR DIFFERENT

00:52:47.064 --> 00:52:51.735 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES TO MAKE HAY WORD

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.637 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:55.572 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS FAR MORE

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:58.575 region:rollup2
RESILIENT EVEN IN THE FACE OF

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:59.843 region:rollup2
THE SLIDE YOU JUST SAW.

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.878 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:02.446 region:rollup2
NEXT SLIDE IT'S SIMPLY A

00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:04.848 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION OF THE ART BAY AREA

00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:06.650 region:rollup2
PROJECT WITH CALTRANS THE MTC

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:08.986 region:rollup2
THE FIRST EVER VULNERABILITY

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:11.588 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF THE BAY AREA WITH

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:12.756 region:rollup2
REGARD TO ACTUAL RISING SEA.

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:14.658 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT WILL HAVE THAT

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:16.193 region:rollup2
COMPLETED NEXT JUNE AND THAT

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:18.295 region:rollup2
WILL BECOME THE BASIS OF THE

00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:20.464 region:rollup2
NEXUS STABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:22.032 region:rollup2
AS WELL. TO ENSURE THAT THAT

00:53:20.464 --> 00:53:23.300 region:rollup2
THEN GETS PUT INTO THE

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:25.369 region:rollup2
INTO THE STRATEGY HOW DO WE

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.503 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE RESILIENT.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:28.272 region:rollup2
THE SECOND WAY WE HELP IS TO

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:29.039 region:rollup2
PERMITTING.

00:53:28.272 --> 00:53:31.108 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY PERMIT NEW

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:32.810 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES.

00:53:31.108 --> 00:53:34.144 region:rollup2
THE CDC ISN'T AFRAID TO PERMIT

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.978 region:rollup2
NEW STRUCTURES BECAUSE WE WE

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:37.648 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:40.150 region:rollup2
RESILIENT TO SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:42.186 region:rollup2
AND WE MAKE SURE. THAT WE BUT

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.587 region:rollup2
PROVE BOTH HARDSCAPE WHICH WE

00:53:42.186 --> 00:53:45.456 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW IS SAY BUILDINGS AND

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:47.725 region:rollup2
THE LIKE AND WALLS. BUT JUST AS

00:53:45.456 --> 00:53:48.225 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT MARSHLAND ENTRY AND

00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.159 region:rollup2
WETLANDS

00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:50.661 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE PROVIDE A SPONGE

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.729 region:rollup2
AFFECT

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:53.697 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE SHALLOWER

00:53:51.729 --> 00:53:55.733 region:rollup2
AREAS WHICH CAN REDUCE FLOODING

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:57.067 region:rollup2
AND ALSO CREATE HABITAT.

00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:58.302 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANT WE'RE

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:59.837 region:rollup2
LEARNING WITH THE PERMIT

00:53:58.302 --> 00:54:01.672 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ADAPT TO THOSE CHANGING

00:54:01.672 --> 00:54:04.908 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:06.376 region:rollup2
WE CAN SAY TO FEET BY TWENTY

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.578 region:rollup2
FIFTY BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.912 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE TWO FEET BY TWENTY

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:10.514 region:rollup2
FIFTH YEAR FOUR FEET BY TWENTY

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.249 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED. IT COULD BE MORE IT

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:14.184 region:rollup2
COULD BE LESS WHICH MEANS THAT

00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:15.753 region:rollup2
WE REQUIRED THOSE PERMIT

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:18.155 region:rollup2
APPLICANTS TO HAVE AN ADAPTIVE

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:18.989 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN. SO THAT THEY

00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:21.492 region:rollup2
CAN QUICKLY ADAPT

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:22.793 region:rollup2
A CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:54:21.492 --> 00:54:24.361 region:rollup2
AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WERE

00:54:22.793 --> 00:54:26.029 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:27.865 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY LOOK

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:29.433 region:rollup2
INTERNAL TO BE CDC AND CHANGE

00:54:27.865 --> 00:54:31.668 region:rollup2
OUR OWN POLICIES AND DO IT

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:33.670 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENTLY WITH WORKSHOPS AND

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:35.272 region:rollup2
WITH PUBLIC INPUT.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.140 region:rollup2
TO THE WAY TO IN THE TO THE

00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:37.975 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH ARE

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.277 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TWO PAGES.

00:54:37.975 --> 00:54:41.678 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS PHIL BC DC WAS

00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:43.380 region:rollup2
CREATED TO REDUCE THE FILL IN

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:44.748 region:rollup2
THE BAY MAKE THE BAY BIGGER.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.816 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE WANT TO IF WE WANT TO

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.316 region:rollup2
BOLSTER CREATE AND PROTECT

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:48.285 region:rollup2
WETLANDS.

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:50.020 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PUT.

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:51.789 region:rollup2
IN THE BANG WE HAVE TO CREATE

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:54.024 region:rollup2
THE WETLANDS SO HOW DO WE CHANGE

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:55.959 region:rollup2
OUR HOW DO WE CHANGE OUR PROCESS

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:57.728 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT DIRT. AND

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:58.896 region:rollup2
DIRT IN THE BAY TO MAKE SURE

00:54:57.728 --> 00:55:01.031 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EXPAND THE

00:54:58.896 --> 00:55:02.466 region:rollup2
WETLANDS TO VERY TECHNICAL ISSUE

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.500 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT OR NOT AND WE'RE

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:05.502 region:rollup2
DOING A PRETTY WELL WILL HAVE

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.869 region:rollup2
THAT DISCUSSED AND AND DEBATED

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.237 region:rollup2
IN DONE WITHIN.

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:09.606 region:rollup2
.

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:11.175 region:rollup2
EIGHT EIGHT TO NINE MONTHS.

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.842 region:rollup2
SECOND WERE ALSO LOOKING COURSE

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:13.343 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:16.313 region:rollup2
EQUITY

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:18.515 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS I SAID SO MUCH OF THE

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:20.617 region:rollup2
BAYS SHORELINE WHICH HAVE

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:22.019 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ON IT ARE IN PLACES

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.420 region:rollup2
LIKE THE CANAL DISTRICT IN

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:25.722 region:rollup2
SANDRA FELL. BAYVIEW HUNTERS

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:28.892 region:rollup2
POINT SAN FRAN.

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:31.261 region:rollup2
EAST PALO ALTO AL WEISEL.

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:33.230 region:rollup2
WEST OAKLAND AND GOING UP TO

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:35.666 region:rollup2
RICHMOND.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:38.435 region:rollup2
VERY VERY DIFFICULT PLACES IN

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:39.937 region:rollup2
WHICH PEOPLE LIVE AND LIVE WITH

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:42.539 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE

00:55:39.937 --> 00:55:44.608 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THOSE AREAS ARE NOT

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:46.577 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. JUST LIKE

00:55:44.608 --> 00:55:47.845 region:rollup2
THEY WERE IN MANY WERE IN THE

00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:49.713 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AREAS AND TIMES IN

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:50.814 region:rollup2
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES.

00:55:49.713 --> 00:55:53.183 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:56.286 region:rollup2
SOLUTION FOR THE BAY WORKS FOR

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:57.554 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY NOT JUST SOME PEOPLE.

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:58.956 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY EVEN MORE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:00.691 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHAT WERE TRYING TO

00:55:58.956 --> 00:56:02.359 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IS TO

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:04.161 region:rollup2
CHANGE NEAR TERM AND THIS IS

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:05.495 region:rollup2
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE

00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:07.264 region:rollup2
WE'RE SMALL STATE AGENCY WHERE

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:08.365 region:rollup2
FORTY PEOPLE BUDGETS LESS THAN

00:56:07.264 --> 00:56:09.499 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS I WAS JUST

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:11.401 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:12.736 region:rollup2
MORNING WORKING WITH THEM. AND

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:14.738 region:rollup2
THEY UNDERSTAND THESE KINDS OF

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:16.173 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:18.141 region:rollup2
SOME DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO

00:56:16.173 --> 00:56:19.743 region:rollup2
HOW BE CDC WORKS.

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:21.645 region:rollup2
JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THAT

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:23.113 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHERE THE GTR A FUNDS

00:56:21.645 --> 00:56:24.381 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALL SUPPLIED FOR

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:25.949 region:rollup2
ADAPTATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:27.050 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR.

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:28.485 region:rollup2
WERE THE RECIPIENT OF FIVE

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.820 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:31.521 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF THE

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.091 region:rollup2
STATE BUDGET BUT IT'S A LOT TO

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:35.259 region:rollup2
BE CDC. AND ENABLES US TO WORK

00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:36.760 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE

00:56:35.259 --> 00:56:38.862 region:rollup2
KINDS OF NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.930 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE THOSE FUNDS ALSO

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:41.431 region:rollup2
WANTS THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:43.100 region:rollup2
THE COSTA CONSERVANCY WHICH MAKE

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:44.034 region:rollup2
GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.102 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO WORK ON

00:56:44.034 --> 00:56:47.170 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN.

00:56:45.102 --> 00:56:49.206 region:rollup2
AND WORK WITH US.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.807 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S TO KEEP MOST UPPERMOST

00:56:49.206 --> 00:56:52.509 region:rollup2
IN MINE. WE NEED TO HAVE

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:54.411 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT PROTECT WHOLE

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:55.846 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FROM FLOODING. AND

00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:57.614 region:rollup2
FROM INUNDATION BECAUSE IT'S

00:56:55.846 --> 00:56:59.483 region:rollup2
ONLY GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE

00:56:57.614 --> 00:57:01.385 region:rollup2
COMMON WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:02.953 region:rollup2
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS CAN KEEP

00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:04.054 region:rollup2
HOLE IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:57:02.953 --> 00:57:05.989 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T HAVE SOCIAL AND

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:08.058 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DISLOCATION BECAUSE

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:10.160 region:rollup2
THAT DISRUPTS EVERYTHING.

00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:11.728 region:rollup2
AND AS SANDY KIND OF STORM WHICH

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.163 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T HAD YET

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:14.631 region:rollup2
COULD CAUSE UP TO SAY TEN

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.734 region:rollup2
DAMAGE TO THE BAY AREA ACCORDING

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:19.436 region:rollup2
TO THE BAY AREA COUNCIL.

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:21.305 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO BE PREPARED

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:23.307 region:rollup2
FOR THAT TYPE OF OCCURRENCE

00:57:21.305 --> 00:57:23.907 region:rollup2
FLOODING HAPPENS NOW SO LETS

00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:25.909 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAST THREE

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:27.377 region:rollup2
SLIDES AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:29.112 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS AND YOU CAN SEE IT

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:30.914 region:rollup2
RIGHT BEHIND YOU. THE SAN

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:32.549 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO EMBARCADERO. THAT'S

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:34.518 region:rollup2
THE BAY BRIDGE RIGHT BEHIND THAT

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:36.086 region:rollup2
TO THE KING TIED. THAT HAPPENS

00:57:34.518 --> 00:57:37.587 region:rollup2
TWICE A YEAR NOW.

00:57:36.086 --> 00:57:38.588 region:rollup2
ON A CLEAR DAY NOT ON A STORMY

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:40.357 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:42.359 region:rollup2
THE NEXT PICTURE

00:57:40.357 --> 00:57:43.860 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN MARIN. THAT'S HIGHWAY

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:45.729 region:rollup2
ONE OH ONE ABOVE THAT WHERE YOU

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.164 region:rollup2
SEE THE BUS.

00:57:45.729 --> 00:57:49.800 region:rollup2
RIGHT BELOW IT IS THE ON RAMP AN

00:57:47.164 --> 00:57:51.968 region:rollup2
OFF RAMP MONEY. TIED BEAUTIFUL

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.571 region:rollup2
DAY IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:56.273 region:rollup2
THE FLOODING OCCURS ALREADY.

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:57.140 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY THE NEXT YOU

00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:58.608 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.377 region:rollup2
FLOODING OF STATE HIGHWAY THIRTY

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:02.112 region:rollup2
SEVEN WHICH CONNECTS FOR

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:03.480 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN NORTH BAY AREA. THIS

00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:05.248 region:rollup2
IS AN INTERSECTION JUST AFTER

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.883 region:rollup2
THAT FLOODING.

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:09.019 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WE CAN

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:10.721 region:rollup2
DISRUPT GOODS AND JUST AS

00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:12.122 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PEOPLE MOVEMENT.

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS OF THE KIND OF

00:58:12.122 --> 00:58:13.924 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WERE DEALING WITH

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.293 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SOLVING WITH OUR

00:58:13.924 --> 00:58:17.728 region:rollup2
PARTNERS.

00:58:16.293 --> 00:58:18.161 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:19.963 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.498 region:rollup2
.

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:22.933 region:rollup2
TO ALL THREE OF YOU THERE. I

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.568 region:rollup2
THINK HAS BEEN A PRESENTATION

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:26.370 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:24.568 --> 00:58:27.971 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE THINGS ARE

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:29.439 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:32.042 region:rollup2
AS A STATE AGENCY.

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:33.310 region:rollup2
WHAT IS BEING DONE AND REGION

00:58:32.042 --> 00:58:34.845 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF COURSE THE EFFORTS

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:36.246 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE DISADVANTAGED

00:58:34.845 --> 00:58:37.981 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I? GUESS MY QUESTION

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:39.950 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:42.052 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD BEGIN TO MAYBE FILL

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:43.453 region:rollup2
IN SOME GAPS.

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:45.255 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE AREAS

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:46.089 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO LOOK

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:48.191 region:rollup2
AT.

00:58:46.089 --> 00:58:49.092 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:51.795 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:52.696 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOW US TO BEGIN TO FILL

00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:54.598 region:rollup2
IN THOSE GAPS KEEPING IN MIND

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:55.732 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:58:54.598 --> 00:58:58.435 region:rollup2
I THINK ALL OF YOU HAVE TOUCHED

00:58:55.732 --> 00:59:01.304 region:rollup2
ON. THESE UP COMMUNITIES THAT

00:58:58.435 --> 00:59:03.740 region:rollup2
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED.

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:05.142 region:rollup2
BY CLAIMING THAT CHANGE AND SO

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:08.512 region:rollup2
WE CAN GO DOWN.

00:59:05.142 --> 00:59:10.013 region:rollup2
THE PANELIST AS HE PRESENTED TO

00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:11.882 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF REYES PROFOUND SOME

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:14.918 region:rollup2
OF THESE AREAS THAT WE CAN BEGIN

00:59:11.882 --> 00:59:18.021 region:rollup2
TO. FILL IN GAPS ADDRESSING SOME

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:18.622 region:rollup2
OF THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS.

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:21.525 region:rollup2
.

00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:23.026 region:rollup2
OOPS.

00:59:21.525 --> 00:59:23.894 region:rollup2
IS THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE I HAVE

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:26.063 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION RIGHT.

00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:27.230 region:rollup2
IS HERE ARE YOU WANTS TO KNOW

00:59:26.063 --> 00:59:28.598 region:rollup2
KIND OF FROM A STATE LEVEL HOW

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.600 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CONNECT.

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:32.302 region:rollup2
.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.638 region:rollup2
WATER ISSUES ACROSS CALIFORNIA

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:36.206 region:rollup2
OR BETWEEN ALL THE DIFFERENCE I

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:37.174 region:rollup2
THINK BETWEEN BETWEEN THE KIND

00:59:36.206 --> 00:59:40.043 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:59:37.174 --> 00:59:41.978 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT RIGHT.

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:42.813 region:rollup2
THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD BACK TO THE

00:59:41.978 --> 00:59:44.548 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED

00:59:42.813 --> 00:59:46.283 region:rollup2
ON.

00:59:44.548 --> 00:59:47.951 region:rollup2
WHETHER BE IN THE EASTERN

00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:48.919 region:rollup2
PECHELL VALUE OR CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:51.855 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:59:48.919 --> 00:59:54.825 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED. I'VE. AT LEAST

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:57.260 region:rollup2
REGARDING WATER SUPPLY ACROSS

00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
THE STATE I DO THINK THAT.

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.665 region:rollup2
OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE THAT.

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:03.033 region:rollup2
I ENTIRE STATE COOPERATIVE

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:04.835 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO ADDRESS WATER SUPPLY

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:07.070 region:rollup2
IS REALLY NECESSARY AND THAT

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:09.906 region:rollup2
SPANS ALL THE SOLUTIONS THAT I

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.942 region:rollup2
SPOKE ABOUT. FROM LOCAL GROUND

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:13.910 region:rollup2
WATER MANAGEMENT TO ENSURING

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A STATE FUND FOR

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:18.115 region:rollup2
INSURING FOR.

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:20.016 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING A RELIABLE DRINKING

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:23.553 region:rollup2
THEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.855 region:rollup2
PLANNING THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.989 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE WATER SUPPLY

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:27.190 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR MOST

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.625 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.360 region:rollup2
AT LOW INCOME AND. COMMITTEES

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:32.596 region:rollup2
AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.332 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THERE'S A AN EFFORT

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:36.967 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY. A CONVERSATION THAT

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:38.535 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO MADE IT TO. AND

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.903 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.238 region:rollup2
AND AND NOW INCORPORATED INTO A

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:42.906 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.841 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THEY FUND

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:46.276 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.544 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT MANY OF SAID THAT

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:49.346 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:51.014 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:52.582 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ALPHA THESE

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:54.417 region:rollup2
REGIONS THAT.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:56.520 region:rollup2
FUNDS ONLY ONLY TOUCHES JUST A

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:58.054 region:rollup2
TINY BIT BUT WE KNOW THAT IT

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.656 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:00.957 region:rollup2
THAT THAT FUND COULD

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.093 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE. I

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:04.361 region:rollup2
GUESS SOME WHAT I WOULD BE

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.362 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN HEARING AS.

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:06.463 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUT THE LOCAL

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:08.331 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT LEVEL I COME FROM

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT YOU

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:11.334 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.936 region:rollup2
DURING MY TENURE THERE TO UPDATE

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.838 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL PLAN.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:16.573 region:rollup2
AND INCORPORATE YOU KNOW PUBLIC

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:19.242 region:rollup2
HEALTH ELEMENTS.

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:20.944 region:rollup2
TO THE GENERAL PLAN WE'RE NOW

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.612 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT ASKING LOCAL

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:24.347 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:27.751 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:28.718 region:rollup2
ADAPTATION PLANS. THERE'S A

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:31.021 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION OF INTEGRATING

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:32.622 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:34.224 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS TO THE PLAN I MEAN

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:37.894 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU SEE.

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:40.096 region:rollup2
THOSE EFFORTS. ULTIMATELY

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:41.398 region:rollup2
PRODUCING AND WHETHER OR NOT AT

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.999 region:rollup2
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL ONE

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.234 region:rollup2
THING AS SAYING HERE WE HAVE

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.302 region:rollup2
THIS PLAN THAT'S IN CORPORATE

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.003 region:rollup2
JOB PLAN.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.705 region:rollup2
THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY AT BEING

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:51.107 region:rollup2
CARRIED OUT. IN NO.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:52.976 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY BY OUR LOCAL

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:54.477 region:rollup2
LEADERS AND DO YOU SEE BABY. AS

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:54.711 region:rollup2
A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LOS

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.080 region:rollup2
ANGELES.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:59.082 region:rollup2
AREA.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.351 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OPPORTUNITIES

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:03.386 region:rollup2
I COME THAT IF YOU CAN COMMENT

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:05.355 region:rollup2
JUST ADD TO THAT.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.823 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABSOLUTELY AT TO

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:08.558 region:rollup2
KIND OF ADDRESS THAT THE GAPS

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:10.560 region:rollup2
AND THEN AND THAT'S.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:12.462 region:rollup2
I'M ISSUE I THINK.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.730 region:rollup2
I. THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.832 region:rollup2
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE SO

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.399 region:rollup2
MUCH SOME POTENTIAL FOR HOW THEY

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:18.335 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.203 region:rollup2
ENGAGE AND THAT ARE REALLY

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:23.106 region:rollup2
LIMITED AT THE MOMENT IN TERMS

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:25.775 region:rollup2
OF OF STAFF AND RESOURCES.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:27.877 region:rollup2
AND AND SO THAT'S KIND OF ONE

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:29.446 region:rollup2
OF THE BIG GAPS AND IT IT MEANS

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2
THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:33.717 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF THE

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.851 region:rollup2
BANDWIDTH TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.019 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:37.153 region:rollup2
PARTNERS.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:39.589 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN SAID.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:40.190 region:rollup2
.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.758 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.826 region:rollup2
KIND OF DOING A BETTER JOB OF

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.060 region:rollup2
ENGAGING.

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:46.563 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND WHAT IT WOULD

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.898 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY LOOK LIE TO IMPLEMENT

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:50.300 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THESE PLANS IN

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:52.269 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.504 region:rollup2
HAVING NOT HAVING.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:56.673 region:rollup2
KIND OF AT THE MOMENT.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:58.008 region:rollup2
LOCAL A LOT OF LOCAL HEALTH

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:59.709 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THAT'S

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:01.278 region:rollup2
THE STAFF CAPACITY AROUND

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:04.047 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:05.882 region:rollup2
TO TO KIND OF DO THAT SO AT

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:07.817 region:rollup2
WITH MORE CAPACITY YOU WOULD BE

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.219 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE INVOLVED IN MORE OF

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.787 region:rollup2
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:12.822 region:rollup2
PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. BUT

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.724 region:rollup2
pALSO TO REALLY DO MEANINGFUL

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
LIKE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:18.328 region:rollup2
PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ON

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:21.665 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES TRAINING

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:22.098 region:rollup2
THIS IS SO CRITICAL TO SEE THOSE

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.501 region:rollup2
PLANS I'M KIND OF.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:26.002 region:rollup2
CARRIED OUT.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:27.270 region:rollup2
THANK YOU PROJECT ADD FOR IT BUT

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.505 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE ALL SORT OF SAYING

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.774 region:rollup2
THE SAME THING FROM SORT OF TEN

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:33.476 region:rollup2
DEGREES OFF BECAUSE WE ALL WORK

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:34.878 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL. PLANNERS AND WE ALL

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:36.379 region:rollup2
WORK WITH LOCAL.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:38.048 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY GROUPS WELL LOOK WORK

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:39.482 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.217 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CANDIDLY AND YOU COME

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:42.986 region:rollup2
FROM THAT WORLD THAT'S WHERE THE

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:44.621 region:rollup2
RUBBER HITS THE ROAD. AND I

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:47.490 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IN MANY RESPECTS WHAT

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:49.592 region:rollup2
THE CDC DOES AS A STATE AGENCY

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.227 region:rollup2
CAN BE A MODEL. AND HOW WE'RE

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.362 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE SUSTAINABLE

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:54.364 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY STRATEGY CAN BE A

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:56.099 region:rollup2
MODEL BECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE NINE

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:56.966 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND FORTY ONE CITIES.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:58.334 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD EACH HAVE THEIR

01:03:56.966 --> 01:04:00.870 region:rollup2
OWN POLICIES.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:04.407 region:rollup2
IN IT AND THEY DO. AND WHAT WE

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:06.609 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SURE IS THAT A.

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:09.546 region:rollup2
AND IS IS A FLOODING POLICY A

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:11.648 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE POLICY FOR ONE COUNTY

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:13.183 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ADVERSELY AFFECT ANOTHER

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:14.217 region:rollup2
COUNTY BY CAUSING MORE FLOODING

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.618 region:rollup2
OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:17.654 region:rollup2
BAY FOR EXAMPLE.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:21.257 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE

01:04:17.654 --> 01:04:22.525 region:rollup2
HAVE IN IN IN IN OUR SET UP.

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:25.061 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:27.097 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND THE CITIES AND WE

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:28.598 region:rollup2
WORK ON A CONSENSUS BASIS TO

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:31.234 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK AT THE

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:33.236 region:rollup2
BAY AS A WHOLE. AND AS WE PLAN

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:34.971 region:rollup2
WE BRING IN THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:36.506 region:rollup2
AND TEACH THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:39.142 region:rollup2
HOW TO THINK ABOUT NOT ONLY

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:41.611 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK UT HOW THEIR WORK

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:43.513 region:rollup2
AFFECTS THE FOLKS NEXT DOOR.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.982 region:rollup2
AND AS WE PERMIT WE WORK WITH

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:49.152 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE DEVELOPER SIDE TO

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:51.020 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THEY DO ALSO

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:52.889 region:rollup2
ENSURE SOME LEVEL A PAVE VERY

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.390 region:rollup2
LARGE REVOLUTE A LEVEL OF

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:56.626 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE AS WELL.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.795 region:rollup2
SO IT COMES DOWN TO ACTUALLY

01:04:56.626 --> 01:05:01.398 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN A WAY

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:03.366 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RECOGNIZE

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.868 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A POSITIVE ROLE

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:06.870 region:rollup2
TO PLAY AND THE SHOULDN'T BE

01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:08.271 region:rollup2
SCARED ABOUT. THE HEAT THEY

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.239 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE SCARED ABOUT THE

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
WATER AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.107 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN ALL FIGURE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.742 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:14.277 region:rollup2
BETTER. AND ALL THAT SOUNDS A

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.979 region:rollup2
LITTLE POLLYANNA ASH BUT FROM A

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:17.046 region:rollup2
PLANNERS PERSPECTIVE AND I'M NOT

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:19.048 region:rollup2
A PLANNER BUT FROM A PLANNERS

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:21.785 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S HOW YOU GET

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:23.453 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF POSITIVE CHANGE.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.521 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I THINK I'M YOU CAN

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.855 region:rollup2
SHED LIGHT TO I THINK THE

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:27.090 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF.

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.658 region:rollup2
AND THE ROLE THAT THE LOCAL

AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE CLOSING.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.530 region:rollup2
COMMENT ABOUT PLANNING I THINK

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.566 region:rollup2
MUCH OF IT. REALLY BOILS DOWN

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:37.066 region:rollup2

STATE I CAN SPEAK FOR THE REGION

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:47.076 region:rollup2
THAT I REPRESENT THAT IS

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:48.745 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO CONTINUE. TO SEE

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:50.380 region:rollup2

AND GET AHEAD OF MUCH OF WHAT

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.689 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CAUSING

01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.857 region:rollup2
SOME CHALLENGES IN OTHER PARTS

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:03.293 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:04.294 region:rollup2

YOU THINK.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:30.153 region:rollup2
THE STATE COULD ADAPT.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:31.821 region:rollup2
OR ADOPT AND.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:33.590 region:rollup2
WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL

TO HELP CARRY OUT SOME OF THESE

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:39.195 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:41.664 region:rollup2
SURE I'LL GO FIRST.

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:43.066 region:rollup2

TO KIND OF ADD ON TO THE LAST

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:50.306 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT LOCAL PLANNING I

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:52.709 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:54.677 region:rollup2
YOU NO TAXES THAT IN ADDITION TO

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:56.479 region:rollup2
MORE FUNDING FOR RESILIENT

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:58.214 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WATER SUPPLY

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:00.283 region:rollup2
FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:01.618 region:rollup2
AND MORE EFFECTIVE GROUND WATER

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:03.286 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:06.556 region:rollup2
JUST WORKING WITH LOCAL

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:08.157 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:09.859 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR DISADVANTAGED

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:11.060 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:12.762 region:rollup2
WILL WITHSTAND KLEIN CLIMATE

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:15.064 region:rollup2
IMPACTS.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:16.399 region:rollup2
AS OF NOW THEY'RE THE MOST

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:18.134 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE UNTIL TERMS OF HEALTH

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:20.436 region:rollup2
BACK IMPACTS FROM PRETTY MUCH

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:22.071 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING BUT IF YOU ADD ON TO

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:23.273 region:rollup2
THAT OUR FUTURE ROOF CLIMATE.

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.773 region:rollup2
VARIABILITY THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:26.876 region:rollup2
EVEN.

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:29.445 region:rollup2
MORE EGREGIOUSLY IMPACTING AND

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:31.347 region:rollup2
EQUITABLY IMPACTING THIS THAT

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.848 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:34.183 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:36.753 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE STATE

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:38.388 region:rollup2
TO WORK ALONGSIDE AT.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:39.822 region:rollup2
WORK ALONGSIDE LOCAL

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:41.357 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TO.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:44.193 region:rollup2
FURTHER DEVELOP THE POLICIES

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:47.063 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN SET OUT AND SP

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:48.698 region:rollup2
TWO FORTY FOUR SP ONE THOUSAND.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.566 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.901 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANS AND LOCAL

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.603 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT PLANNING DOES NEED TO

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.438 region:rollup2
TAKE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:58.241 region:rollup2
GROUPS INTO ACCOUNT.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:59.842 region:rollup2
AND PLAN FOR ALLEN HOW IT WILL

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.577 region:rollup2
GET EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:02.879 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHAT

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:05.081 region:rollup2
WATER WASTE WATERS.

01:08:02.879 --> 01:08:05.648 region:rollup2
STORM WATER PROTECTION FIRE

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:08.451 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:10.219 region:rollup2
AND AND FURTHER.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:11.988 region:rollup2
FURTHER DEVELOP THAT AS FAR

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:14.557 region:rollup2
INSOFAR AS IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:17.961 region:rollup2
CLIMATE THAT ADAPTATION.

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:20.496 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:22.565 region:rollup2
I THINK I'M AS AS WE WORK AND I

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
WOULD ECHO AMANDA SUGGESTIONS

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:26.002 region:rollup2
AROUND KIND OF.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:29.238 region:rollup2
INCREASING CAPACITY AROUND.

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:31.107 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:32.809 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT KIND OF

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:35.244 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A CONTINUING TO PROVIDE

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:37.080 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.384 region:rollup2
THROUGH KIND OF POLICY SETTING

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:43.152 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS US.

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:45.121 region:rollup2
KIND OF HAVE STANDARDS SO FOR

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.856 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE WORKING ON

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:49.359 region:rollup2
URBAN HEAT ISLAND REDUCTION.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:50.793 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAD THINKING THROUGH

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.861 region:rollup2
COOL PAVEMENTS HAS BEEN A

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:54.330 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T IT

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:55.531 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR FOR COOL

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.734 region:rollup2
PAVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:08:55.531 --> 01:09:00.570 region:rollup2
SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHERE.

01:08:57.734 --> 01:09:02.372 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE CAN GET GET OUT

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:03.706 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:05.875 region:rollup2
AND HELP.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:08.211 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PROVIDE US KIND OF

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:10.146 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT THAT WE CAN ADOPT

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.147 region:rollup2
HAS ALWAYS REALLY HELPFUL IN

01:09:10.146 --> 01:09:13.116 region:rollup2
THAT AREA AS WELL.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:15.251 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THANK YOU.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:16.586 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:18.021 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT NOBODY NEEDS MORE

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:19.355 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:20.923 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE EVERYBODY DOES.

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:22.125 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STEAL

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:23.726 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT SECRETARY BRIGHTS

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:25.194 region:rollup2
THUNDER WHO COMES UP RIGHT AFTER

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:26.729 region:rollup2
ME ABOUT THE NATURAL RESOURCES

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:28.898 region:rollup2
AGENCY BUT I THINK THE RESOURCE

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:30.933 region:rollup2
AGENCY HAS A REALLY GOOD IDEA

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:32.468 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW. ON THE FLOODING IN

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:34.437 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE SIDE WE CAN WORK.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:36.139 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TO ISSUE GUIDANCE THAT

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:38.641 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE TO

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
HELP THEMSELVES FIGURE OUT HOW

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:42.211 region:rollup2
TO HOW TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:44.947 region:rollup2
MORE RESILIENCE AND TO CREATE

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:46.516 region:rollup2
WORKSHOPS AND TO. BE DOWN THERE

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:48.184 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE LOCAL PLANNERS AND

01:09:46.516 --> 01:09:49.419 region:rollup2
EDUCATE THEM ABOUT HOW ALL OF

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.120 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:53.356 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE MORE THEY ACTUALLY

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.725 region:rollup2
SEE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:57.760 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY HAS THE

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.995 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO HELP FROM A PLANNING

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.396 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE BETTER

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:02.165 region:rollup2
OFF WE ARE.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:03.1000 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THE RESOURCES

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:05.902 region:rollup2
AGENCY IS AS IS IS DOING A

01:10:03.1000 --> 01:10:07.603 region:rollup2
PRETTY DARN GOOD JOB OF THAT. I

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.305 region:rollup2
WOULD I WOULD END BY SAYING THAT

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:10.973 region:rollup2
I AM OF THE GENERATION. WHICH

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:13.176 region:rollup2
REMEMBERS.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:14.977 region:rollup2
THE FRAM OIL FILTER COMPANY

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
WHICH PROBABLY NOBODY ELSE DOES

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:18.381 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.849 region:rollup2
TO YOUR OIL FILTER.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.850 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR ENGINE BLOWS UP RIGHT.

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.085 region:rollup2
THEY USED TO HAVE A MARVELOUS

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.786 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL THAT ALWAYS ENDED

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:26.322 region:rollup2
WITH THE SAYING.

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:28.591 region:rollup2
YOU CAN PAY ME NOW.

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:31.394 region:rollup2
OR YOU CAN PAY ME LATER.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:33.096 region:rollup2
AND THE KEY THERE IS SPEND LESS

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.831 region:rollup2
MONEY NOW ON PREVENTION IN ORDER

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:37.834 region:rollup2
TO AVOID SPENDING MORE MONEY

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:39.102 region:rollup2
LATER ON CLEANING IT UP.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:41.971 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MAN.

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:51.380 region:rollup2
ANALOGY OR STATEMENT TO MAKE A.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:51.681 region:rollup2
THAT IS OPERABLE TO A LOT OF

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.348 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO.

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:52.715 region:rollup2
AND GOVERNMENT AND EVEN IN OUR

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:53.249 region:rollup2
OWN. PERSONAL.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:53.850 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ENDEAVORS THAT

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.517 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A TAKING CARE OF

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.752 region:rollup2
OUR OWN HOME.

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:57.887 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.988 region:rollup2
OF THE ROOF.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:00.256 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THINGS KIND OF

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.890 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THINK THE GOVERNOR DID

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.458 region:rollup2
A GOOD JOB IN USING THOSE TYPES

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.027 region:rollup2
OF.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:06.496 region:rollup2

INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.802 region:rollup2

.

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:55.191 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THE PLAN IS

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:57.226 region:rollup2
DELIBERATELY CONSTRAINED AROUND

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:59.128 region:rollup2
STATE. GOVERNMENT AND ITS

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.029 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS IN THE PAST THE PLAN

WOVEN IN CLIMATE IMPACTS AND

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:07.203 region:rollup2
MORE CALLS TO ACTION BUT WE WERE

DESIGNING THE PLAN AROUND. JUST

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:13.008 region:rollup2
THOSE SPECIFIC STEPS THAT WE

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:14.343 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AS NECESSARY

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.978 region:rollup2
AND WE THOUGHT IT MADE A VERY

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.646 region:rollup2
MUCH CLEANER.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:21.584 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION AND GAVE

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:21.751 region:rollup2

.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:28.324 region:rollup2
SO WE ORGANIZED A PLAN.

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:29.291 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE THE POLICY COMMITTEES

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:30.826 region:rollup2

ABOUT IN TERMS OF IT IS NOT JUST

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:41.303 region:rollup2

EVERY AGENCY STATE GOVERNMENT

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:50.413 region:rollup2
AND EVERY PROGRAM SHOULD BE

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:51.580 region:rollup2

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:13.128 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES POLITICAL TO SEE

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:13.996 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE REPORTS TRANSLATE TO

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:15.564 region:rollup2
THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.866 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT IS CONTROLLED BY

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:18.434 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT SIDES AS IT GOES

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.102 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:22.004 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE WATCHING HOW THOSE

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:23.472 region:rollup2
PLANS DEVELOP AND THEY WILL ALSO

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:26.475 region:rollup2
BE WATCHING HOW THOSE THOSE.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:28.344 region:rollup2
FUNDING DECISIONS ARE MADE DOWN

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:30.446 region:rollup2
TO THE GROUND. AND WE ALSO

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.913 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT. WHO CAN JUMP

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:34.116 region:rollup2
THROUGH SOME OF THESE?

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:35.818 region:rollup2
?

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
INCREASING WATER CONSERVATION

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.355 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURE NOT ONLY THROUGH.

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.623 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY THROUGH THE IRRIGATION

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:42.458 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS BUT ALSO THROUGH

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:43.058 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE SLOW CONTENT OF

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:45.694 region:rollup2
THE.

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:47.830 region:rollup2
OF OF OF THE SOIL ITSELF TO THE

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:49.732 region:rollup2
OF THE THE CARBON CONTENT OF THE

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.867 region:rollup2
SOIL ITSELF. I'M THIS IS REALLY

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:54.069 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT JUST NOT ONLY AS A

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.270 region:rollup2
MITIGATION SOLUTION BUT ALSO AS

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:57.606 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:59.775 region:rollup2
AS A PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTION FOR.

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:02.511 region:rollup2
FOOD PRODUCTION AND.

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:04.146 region:rollup2
IT IS REALLY EMERGING IN THE IN

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:05.781 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE SOLUTIONS SPACE AS

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:08.150 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE KEY OPPORTUNITIES WE

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:09.919 region:rollup2
HAVE TO EXPAND THE USE OF OUR.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:12.688 region:rollup2
WORKING LANDS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:14.156 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND INCREASE FOOD

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:16.625 region:rollup2
SECURITY IN THE PROCESS.

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:17.660 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FINAL IN EXAMPLES OF

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.260 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY CAME

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.628 region:rollup2

DEPARTMENTS IT'S NOT EASY TO

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:17.112 region:rollup2
TAKE THIRTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.647 region:rollup2
INTO A CLIMATE JUSTICE

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:20.416 region:rollup2

EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER INTO

01:21:11.033 --> 01:21:14.870 region:rollup2
ONE COHESIVE PACKAGE IT'S NOT.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:16.305 region:rollup2
BROKEN INTO DIFFERENT POLICY

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.273 region:rollup2
AREA SILOS SO.

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:18.440 region:rollup2

BE.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.944 region:rollup2
A REALLY IMPORTANT BLUEPRINT

VERSIONS OF MATURING THAT WORK.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:32.921 region:rollup2
WITH THE SAME NETWORKS BECAUSE

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.323 region:rollup2
THAT WAS JUST INCREDIBLY

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.490 region:rollup2
VALUABLE.

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:37.025 region:rollup2

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:46.128 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE WAY WE'RE DOING AND

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:47.996 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS IT WAS.

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:50.032 region:rollup2
VERY PROMISING TO SEE THAT

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:52.167 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS BY THOSE PROGRAM

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:53.669 region:rollup2
MANAGERS TAKE THE STEPS THAT

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:55.237 region:rollup2
THEY RECOMMENDED. IT WAS

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:57.406 region:rollup2
SURPRISING HOW LITTLE.

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:59.074 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST I THINK THIS MORE

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:00.609 region:rollup2
IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT BUT. THIS

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:02.311 region:rollup2
TIME AROUND OF SIP IT WAS

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:04.813 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING HOW LITTLE WE HAD TO

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:06.114 region:rollup2
PUSH THESE AGENCIES TO COME UP

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:08.717 region:rollup2
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS SO.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:10.452 region:rollup2
WE FEEL WE YOU KNOW THAT

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:11.286 region:rollup2
PROCESSES SOCIALIZING CLIMATE

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:14.022 region:rollup2
CHANGE THROUGHOUT THESE

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:15.490 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AGENCIES IN THE END WE

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:17.125 region:rollup2
REALLY HOPE THAT YOU DON'T NEED

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.760 region:rollup2
AN AGENCY TO COORDINATE CLIMATE

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.828 region:rollup2
CHANGE ACROSS DEPARTMENTS I MEAN

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.563 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.764 region:rollup2
OURSELVES OUT OF A. OUT OF A JOB

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:24.333 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS HE'S JUST BE

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:25.901 region:rollup2
BASELINE CONSIDERATIONS THE

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.236 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:28.003 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT INCORPORATE INTO

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:28.904 region:rollup2
THEIR INTO THEIR INTO THEIR

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:30.772 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:31.773 region:rollup2
.

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:34.510 region:rollup2
THE NEXT PIECE THAT I WANTED TO

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:35.143 region:rollup2
JUST TOUCH ON IS THAT WE'VE WE

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.312 region:rollup2
WERE WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:39.515 region:rollup2
DEVELOP. METRICS.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:41.717 region:rollup2
IN WAYS TO TRACK

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:43.485 region:rollup2
PROGRESS ON THE DOCUMENT ITSELF.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:44.753 region:rollup2
WE WANT.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:46.221 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDING TO TO BE A

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:48.056 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT.

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:50.225 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY TOOL FOR FOR FOR

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:51.827 region:rollup2
OUR FOR OURSELVES BUT ALSO FOR

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.861 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WATCHING GOVERNMENT I

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:54.596 region:rollup2
MEAN IT SHOULD BE THE THING THAT

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.530 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GRAB IF YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:57.266 region:rollup2
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH

TRANSPORTATION OR WHATNOT. YOU

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:59.735 region:rollup2
SHOULD USE THAT AND THEN REALLY

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.570 region:rollup2
PUSHED.

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:03.305 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ON ARE YOU ACHIEVING

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.872 region:rollup2

AND.

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.808 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE KINDA EXPOSED

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:08.210 region:rollup2
HERSELF IN MANY WAYS THERE BY

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:10.178 region:rollup2
PUTTING THAT OUT THERE BUT IT'S

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.313 region:rollup2
IT IT WAS INTENTIONAL BECAUSE WE

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:14.049 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO

01:24:11.313 --> 01:24:14.716 region:rollup2
WE CAN BE PUSHED HARDER. AND AND

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:17.552 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS PROGRESS.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:18.854 region:rollup2
WE WILL GO FORWARD AND PUT OUT

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.088 region:rollup2
REPORTS

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:20.923 region:rollup2

ADMINISTRATION AND.

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:25.294 region:rollup2
THEN LATER ON ON HOW FAR WE'VE

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.928 region:rollup2
COME IN AND MEETING THESE GOALS

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:27.930 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:29.665 region:rollup2
NEED I THINK WITH THE METRICS

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:31.700 region:rollup2
IN A PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY IS ONE

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:33.502 region:rollup2
OF THOSE AREAS WHERE IT IS GOING

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.637 region:rollup2
TO BE CRITICAL THAT WE TRACK.

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:37.606 region:rollup2
TRACK THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:38.640 region:rollup2
CHANGE ON POPULATION BUT ALSO

01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:40.042 region:rollup2
THAT IN THAT CAN HELP US FIND TO

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.210 region:rollup2
NO RESPONSE.

THE LAST THING I WANTED TO SAY

01:24:47.983 --> 01:24:52.087 region:rollup2
KIND OF WRAP THIS UP IS.

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:53.255 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING AS SINCE WE

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:55.123 region:rollup2
RELEASED AS PLANNED.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:56.558 region:rollup2
THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:58.126 region:rollup2
THE STATE NEEDS TO DO BUT IT'S

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:59.861 region:rollup2
ALSO THE SAME TYPE OF EXERCISE

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.762 region:rollup2
THE LOCALS NEED TO DO AS WELL.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.364 region:rollup2

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.065 region:rollup2
INTERESTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:03.966 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT THAT WE'VE PUT

01:25:03.065 --> 01:25:05.867 region:rollup2

WHILE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:10.152 region:rollup2
THAT UPDATE SENATE BILL THREE

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.887 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE.

01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:13.221 region:rollup2
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:15.390 region:rollup2
REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:16.458 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE CLIMATE RISK INTO THE

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.626 region:rollup2
SAFETY ELEMENT OF THEIR GENERAL

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:19.594 region:rollup2
PLAN.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:21.129 region:rollup2
AND SO WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:22.164 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW OF IT WE HAVE PROVIDED

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:24.399 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE.

01:28:22.164 --> 01:28:25.834 region:rollup2
BOTH. IN HOW TO DO THAT IN THE

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:26.868 region:rollup2
SAFETY ELEMENT BUT THEN ALSO HOW

01:28:25.834 --> 01:28:28.870 region:rollup2
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT CLIMATE

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:29.938 region:rollup2
CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.606 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLAN.

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:33.441 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:34.442 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND WE'RE WORKING

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:36.278 region:rollup2
WITH A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:37.846 region:rollup2
THAT ARE. IMPLEMENTING SP THREE

01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:39.080 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE AND GOING THROUGH

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:41.383 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY ELEMENT UPDATE

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.651 region:rollup2
PROCESS NOW SINGLE MORTAR REPORT

01:28:41.383 --> 01:28:44.186 region:rollup2
ON THAT BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:45.887 region:rollup2
HIS HANDS ON HIS WE CAN WAS

01:28:44.186 --> 01:28:46.321 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:48.423 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TO DO THAT.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:50.158 region:rollup2
.

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:51.693 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WE POINT TO THE

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.195 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IN THE TOOLS AT THE

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:54.596 region:rollup2
STATE HAS PRODUCED SOME CLUED IN

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.331 region:rollup2
THE ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE IN

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:58.066 region:rollup2
KALIDAS. AND OTHER TOOLS TO

01:28:56.331 --> 01:29:00.101 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THAT WORK.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:02.037 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE WE

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:03.538 region:rollup2
HAD WE UNDERTOOK THE UPDATE WAS

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:05.207 region:rollup2
TO INTEGRATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:07.309 region:rollup2
JUSTICE AND EQUITY INTO THE

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:09.177 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT OVERALL. AGAIN EYES

01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:10.679 region:rollup2
SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND PASSED

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:13.715 region:rollup2
WHILE WE WERE OUT WORKING ON THE

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:14.850 region:rollup2
UPDATE. AND SO FOLLOWING WE'RE

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:16.618 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDST OF DOING A PRETTY

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.320 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC OUTREACH

01:29:16.618 --> 01:29:19.921 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT AND WILL BE

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.555 region:rollup2
RELEASING AND BY THE END OF THIS

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.424 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.791 region:rollup2
REVISED GUIDANCE ON

01:29:22.424 --> 01:29:23.758 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:25.393 region:rollup2
.

01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:27.095 region:rollup2
I MENTAL JUSTICE.

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:29.564 region:rollup2
I SHOULD SAY THAT GENERAL PLAN

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:31.233 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES UPDATE PROCESS.

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:33.501 region:rollup2
TOOK A NUMBER TOOK SEVERAL

01:29:31.233 --> 01:29:35.170 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DO IT WAS BASED ON A

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:36.838 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC

01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:37.706 region:rollup2
OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. AND

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:39.441 region:rollup2
INPUT.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:41.843 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE CREATED A DOCUMENT

01:29:39.441 --> 01:29:43.445 region:rollup2
THAT I WE HOPE IS SUPPORTING

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:44.946 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO ONE

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:46.748 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN UPDATE AS NEW

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:48.650 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:50.185 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOR

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:51.086 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE WHAT

01:29:50.185 --> 01:29:52.921 region:rollup2
DOING THEIR GENERAL PLAN WORK.

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:55.023 region:rollup2
.

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:56.358 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OF HOW

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:58.627 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH LOCAL

01:29:56.358 --> 01:30:00.662 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS IS ALSO THROUGH.

01:29:58.627 --> 01:30:01.930 region:rollup2
A GROUP CALLED THE ALLIANCE OF

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:04.299 region:rollup2
REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S FOR

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:06.034 region:rollup2
CLIMATE ADAPTATION OR ARCA.

01:30:04.299 --> 01:30:08.236 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS BEEN A REALLY

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:08.904 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO WORK

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.205 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL AND REGIONAL

01:30:08.904 --> 01:30:12.307 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS IS

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.508 region:rollup2
PORT. CLIMATE ADAPTATION THEY

01:30:12.307 --> 01:30:14.643 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO WORKING WITH LOCAL

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:15.310 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS WERE UPDATING THEIR

01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:16.878 region:rollup2
GENERAL PLANS.

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:19.247 region:rollup2
.

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:21.082 region:rollup2
BUT ARCA INCLUDES MEMBERS FROM

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:22.350 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MAJOR REGIONS AROUND THE

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:25.186 region:rollup2
STATE INCLUDING.

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:26.988 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO THE BAY AREA A LOS

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:28.523 region:rollup2
ANGELES SAN DIEGO THERE ARE.

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:30.025 region:rollup2
.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:31.226 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE SWARMING IN OTHER

01:30:30.025 --> 01:30:32.994 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:34.930 region:rollup2
INLAND EMPIRE AYE AND THE

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:35.864 region:rollup2
CENTRAL COAST.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:38.900 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS BEEN A REALLY

01:30:35.864 --> 01:30:40.402 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO HEAR

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.703 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND

01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:43.471 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW THE WORK WE'RE

01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:45.140 region:rollup2
DOING CAN SUPPORT WHAT'S

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:47.142 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. I'M AND REALLY.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:49.711 region:rollup2
CREATE BETTER ALIGNMENT.

01:30:47.142 --> 01:30:52.047 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND IT INITIATIVE THAT

01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:52.948 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN UNDERTAKING AT OPR IS

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:54.482 region:rollup2
THIS THEN THE DEVELOPMENT

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.684 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTEGRATED

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:57.819 region:rollup2
CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND

01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:59.721 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY PROGRAM. AND THIS IS

01:30:57.819 --> 01:31:00.855 region:rollup2
CREATED THROUGH LEGISLATION

01:30:59.721 --> 01:31:01.423 region:rollup2
THROUGH SENATE BILL TWO FOUR SIX

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:03.291 region:rollup2
SIX WHICH WAS CITED A LOT IN

01:31:01.423 --> 01:31:06.061 region:rollup2
AYE.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:07.729 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WHAT YOU CALL

01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:09.097 region:rollup2
THIS AYE CARP BECAUSE WE NEED AN

01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:11.566 region:rollup2
ACRONYM FOR EVERYTHING.

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:13.668 region:rollup2
THEIR TWO PRIMARY ELEMENTS TO

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:15.270 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM ONE IS A TECHNICAL

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:16.871 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COUNCIL.

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:19.341 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:21.409 region:rollup2
INCLUDES STATE REPRESENTATION

01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:22.911 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS AND

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:24.179 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR MEMBERS.

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:25.847 region:rollup2
.

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:27.949 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS REALLY ESTABLISHED TO

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:29.985 region:rollup2
FACILITATE COORDINATION ACROSS

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:31.553 region:rollup2
STATE LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:33.288 region:rollup2
AROUND CLIMATE ADAPTATION.

01:31:31.553 --> 01:31:35.156 region:rollup2
WE MEET QUARTERLY.

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:37.592 region:rollup2
IN A PUBLIC VENUES WE HAVE

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:38.259 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY NOTICE AND I MEETINGS

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:40.295 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:41.029 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE PUBLICLY

01:31:40.295 --> 01:31:42.664 region:rollup2
NOTICE WORKGROUP MEETING.

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:43.798 region:rollup2
.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.700 region:rollup2
THEY WERE EVEN MEETING AROUND

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:47.335 region:rollup2
THE STATE AYE WE JUST STARTED

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.270 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR SO WE'VE HAD FIVE

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:51.339 region:rollup2
MEETINGS TO DATE. AND WE'VE

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:52.040 region:rollup2
TAKEN ON A SEVERAL TASKS AS A

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.708 region:rollup2
GROUP.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:55.210 region:rollup2
THE FIRST WAS THAT ADOPTED THE

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:57.212 region:rollup2
ADOPTION OF A VISION AND SET OF

01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:58.947 region:rollup2
PRINCIPLES FOR ADAPTATION ONE OF

01:31:57.212 --> 01:32:01.016 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THINGS THAT TECHNICAL

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:02.484 region:rollup2
VICE THREE COUNCIL NOTED. WAS WE

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:04.219 region:rollup2
ALL WANT TO SUPPORT ADAPTATION

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:06.154 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED A BETTER IDEA AND

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.654 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT

01:32:06.154 --> 01:32:07.522 region:rollup2
IS IT THAT WE'RE WORKING

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.623 region:rollup2
TOWARDS.

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:10.358 region:rollup2
AND IT'S HARD TO SET A

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:12.594 region:rollup2
QUANTITATIVE TARGET FOR THAT AND

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:14.129 region:rollup2
SO WE AS A GROUP DID WAS ADOPTED

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:15.864 region:rollup2
A VISION AND A SET OF PRINCIPLES

01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:17.265 region:rollup2
FOR ACHIEVING THAT VISION. AND

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:19.401 region:rollup2
THAT VISION REALLY LOOKS AT A

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:21.336 region:rollup2
VERY HOLISTIC.

01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:22.570 region:rollup2
APPROACH WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:24.005 region:rollup2
THE RESILIENCE OF NOT JUST OUR

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:25.073 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT OF OUR PEOPLE

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:26.274 region:rollup2
AND COMMUNITIES AND OUR NATURAL

01:32:25.073 --> 01:32:27.776 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:29.944 region:rollup2
AND HOW DOES ALL WORK TOGETHER

01:32:27.776 --> 01:32:31.646 region:rollup2
AND ULTIMATELY TO ACHIEVE A

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:33.014 region:rollup2
STATE OF RESILIENCE WE NEED TO

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:35.150 region:rollup2
THINK ACROSS ALL OF THOSE.

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.750 region:rollup2
PIECES.

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:38.086 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:38.887 region:rollup2
AND THEN WITH THAT WE'VE IN

01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:40.755 region:rollup2
THING ABOUT HOW IS IT THAT WE

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:42.524 region:rollup2
TRACK OUR PROGRESS OF BUILDING

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:44.659 region:rollup2
OFF OF SAFEGUARDING US WORK AND

01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:45.994 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTIONS. HOW IS IT THAT WE

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:47.028 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:32:45.994 --> 01:32:49.130 region:rollup2
FROM PLANNING THROUGH TO

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:51.299 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION?

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:53.034 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THAT WORK

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:54.436 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN AROUND PROTECTING

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:56.504 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN

01:32:54.436 --> 01:32:58.640 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS CALLED OUT.

01:32:56.504 --> 01:33:00.775 region:rollup2
IN EXECUTIVE ORDER B. THIRTY

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.876 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WHICH GOVERNOR BROWN

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:03.478 region:rollup2
SIGNED IN APRIL TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:33:01.876 --> 01:33:04.813 region:rollup2
SO I CALLED OUT AND SAFEGUARDING

01:33:03.478 --> 01:33:06.481 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MENTIONED IN THE

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:07.916 region:rollup2
PANEL PREVIOUSLY BUT. HOW

01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:09.684 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE REALLY

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:11.119 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE PROTECTION OF OUR

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:13.521 region:rollup2
MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:15.290 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA? AND SO RECENTLY.

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:17.559 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO DEFINE

01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:19.027 region:rollup2
WHATTHAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO WHAT

01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:20.795 region:rollup2
IS IT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY IT'S NOT JUST

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:24.399 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE TO CLIMB AT RISK. SOME

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:26.134 region:rollup2
OF THE INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:28.503 region:rollup2
OF POPULATIONS IN LOCATIONS THAT

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:30.138 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTE TO VULNERABILITY.

01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:32.640 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ARE WORKING TO

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:34.409 region:rollup2
FINALIZE SOME RESOURCE MATERIALS

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.511 region:rollup2
THAT CAN HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:38.746 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS TO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:39.914 region:rollup2
HOW TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND PROTECT

OF AN ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE.

01:33:47.322 --> 01:33:51.559 region:rollup2
AND SO. I THE CLEARINGHOUSE IS

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.694 region:rollup2
BASICALLY IS A A RESOURCE THAT'S

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:55.096 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC

CHALLENGES OF EXTREME HEAT.

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:57.265 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY AREA WHICH IN

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:59.734 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE SEE THE GREATEST

01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:01.035 region:rollup2
DIRECT LOSS OF LIFE AND ILLNESS.

01:38:59.734 --> 01:39:02.537 region:rollup2

POSSIBLE INCREASINGLY THOUGH

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:06.294 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE SO WE SEE THAT THE

01:41:04.025 --> 01:41:07.762 region:rollup2
RISK FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT

01:41:06.294 --> 01:41:08.563 region:rollup2
EVENLY DISTRIBUTED SOME

01:41:07.762 --> 01:41:09.964 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS ARE

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:11.666 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE

01:41:09.964 --> 01:41:13.568 region:rollup2
AND IN PARTICULAR. THOSE

FACING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS

01:41:31.319 --> 01:41:34.722 region:rollup2
THAT EXACERBATE ALL OF THOSE

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.123 region:rollup2
SAME VULNERABILITIES. FOR

01:41:34.722 --> 01:41:38.326 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE SOME COMMUNITIES COLOR

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:39.894 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO RESIDE IN AREAS

01:41:38.326 --> 01:41:41.462 region:rollup2
WITH MORE PAYMENT LESS PARKS

01:41:39.894 --> 01:41:42.897 region:rollup2
ENTRY CANOPY WE'VE HAD AN

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:44.565 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT DISCUSSION BY DOCTOR

01:41:42.897 --> 01:41:46.567 region:rollup2
ROADS FOR URBAN HEAT ISLANDS.

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:48.102 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING INEQUITIES IN THE

ENVIRONMENT AND THE IN WHICH

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:52.673 region:rollup2
MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES LIVE.

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:54.275 region:rollup2
ARE THEN JUST EXACERBATED.

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:54.775 region:rollup2
I'M THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE

01:41:54.275 --> 01:41:56.844 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AIR

01:41:54.775 --> 01:41:57.945 region:rollup2
CONDITIONING FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.447 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ONE

01:41:57.945 --> 01:42:01.115 region:rollup2
OR MORE OF THE CHRONIC DISEASES

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:02.617 region:rollup2
THAT THAT. ARE SO PREVALENT IN

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:04.986 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY.

01:42:02.617 --> 01:42:06.487 region:rollup2
YEAH DPH WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZE

01:42:04.986 --> 01:42:08.489 region:rollup2
THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:10.458 region:rollup2
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:11.892 region:rollup2
ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND

01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:13.094 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WILL WORSEN THE

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:14.228 region:rollup2
EXISTING HEALTH INEQUITIES AND

01:42:13.094 --> 01:42:15.229 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:16.897 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:18.165 region:rollup2

ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO MAY LOOK

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:14.488 region:rollup2

YOU'RE DEVELOPING YOUR SPENDING

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.016 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIME ENERGY AND

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:17.251 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND REALLY

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:18.585 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATING.

01:49:17.251 --> 01:49:19.753 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE

01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:32.232 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:34.435 region:rollup2
YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE DO TRACK

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:35.002 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRESS AND OF HOW LOCAL

01:49:34.435 --> 01:49:36.170 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING IN OF

01:49:35.002 --> 01:49:37.905 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:39.406 region:rollup2
WITH THAT AS WITH STATE AGENCIES

01:49:37.905 --> 01:49:41.008 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT AND HOW

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:41.909 region:rollup2
THEY APPROACH IT THIS SUMMER.

01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:44.411 region:rollup2
GOING OUT.

01:49:41.909 --> 01:49:45.379 region:rollup2
VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN AND SOME

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:47.781 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO PULL ALONG A LITTLE

01:49:45.379 --> 01:49:50.317 region:rollup2
MORE I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:52.219 region:rollup2
NOTE IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE

01:49:50.317 --> 01:49:53.520 region:rollup2
DONE HERE IS ALSO DO WE DON'T

01:49:52.219 --> 01:49:55.255 region:rollup2
WANT TO JUST PUSH INFORMATION

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.824 region:rollup2
OUT. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:58.492 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T JUST THROW INFORMATION

01:49:56.824 --> 01:49:59.960 region:rollup2
AND TOOLS OUT THERE AND EXPECT

01:49:58.492 --> 01:50:01.428 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN UP. IT'S A

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.729 region:rollup2
TWO WAY STREET AND I THINK

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:03.964 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:05.466 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO THROUGH.

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:06.733 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL

01:50:05.466 --> 01:50:08.068 region:rollup2
PLAN GUIDELINES THROUGH THE

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:10.270 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED CRIME ADAPTATION

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:12.906 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY PROGRAM IS CREATE

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:14.208 region:rollup2
MORE OF THAT BACK AND FORTH SO.

01:50:12.906 --> 01:50:15.876 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF OUR TIME

01:50:14.208 --> 01:50:17.778 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES OR LOCAL

01:50:15.876 --> 01:50:18.378 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS TIME AND RESOURCES

01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:20.180 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE NOT LISTENING TO ONE

01:50:18.378 --> 01:50:23.050 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. SO I THINK.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:24.451 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARE

01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:25.919 region:rollup2
THEY USING TOOLS WHAT ARE THEY

01:50:24.451 --> 01:50:27.855 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO.

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:29.323 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN BETTER PROVIDE

01:50:27.855 --> 01:50:30.290 region:rollup2
INFORMATION RESOURCES AND

01:50:29.323 --> 01:50:32.493 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:34.261 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THEN AND CREATE A

01:50:32.493 --> 01:50:35.295 region:rollup2
VENUE TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE AS

01:50:34.261 --> 01:50:36.663 region:rollup2
WELL BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:38.699 region:rollup2
ALSO A LOT WE CAN LEARN FROM

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:40.100 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THAT'S

01:50:38.699 --> 01:50:41.969 region:rollup2
WHY IT WOULD I MENTION THE

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:44.505 region:rollup2
REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S REALLY

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:45.105 region:rollup2

GROUND.

01:50:45.506 --> 01:50:48.976 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK WE ARE THE ANSWER

01:50:47.407 --> 01:50:50.277 region:rollup2
IS YES WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:52.379 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING INFORMATION BEING

01:50:50.277 --> 01:50:53.914 region:rollup2
TAKEN UP BUT THERE'S WORK TO DO

01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:56.083 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE.

01:50:53.914 --> 01:50:57.584 region:rollup2

THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. WHEN

01:51:37.457 --> 01:51:40.027 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF

01:51:38.392 --> 01:51:42.496 region:rollup2
THESE RESOURCES ARE BEING

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:44.731 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED IN THE SPECIFIC AREAS.

01:51:42.496 --> 01:51:46.433 region:rollup2
WHAT COMES TO MIND IS YOU KNOW

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:48.302 region:rollup2
A CITY THAT'S IT WILL SAY YOU

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:50.337 region:rollup2
KNOW WE WE ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE OF? X. Y.

01:51:50.337 --> 01:51:53.040 region:rollup2
AND Z. REASONS IN PART OF IT IS

01:51:52.573 --> 01:51:54.107 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

PLANNING EFFORT IN THE COMMUNITY

01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:03.584 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO THEN.

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:05.586 region:rollup2
.

01:52:03.584 --> 01:52:07.654 region:rollup2
ALIGN THE ELIGIBILITY

01:52:05.586 --> 01:52:09.923 region:rollup2

01:52:07.654 --> 01:52:11.625 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IS. AS SIMPLE AS

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:13.260 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UPDATING THE GENERAL

01:52:11.625 --> 01:52:14.194 region:rollup2
PLANS IN INTEGRATING THESE

01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:16.563 region:rollup2
OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE'RE

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:18.966 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT COULD POTENTIALLY.

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:20.834 region:rollup2
LEAD TO SOME OF THESE FUNDING

01:52:18.966 --> 01:52:22.269 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AYE THAT WE'RE

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:23.737 region:rollup2
JUST TALKING ABOUT SO.

01:52:22.269 --> 01:52:24.671 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO

01:52:23.737 --> 01:52:25.806 region:rollup2
DO STILL.

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:28.542 region:rollup2
IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:52:25.806 --> 01:52:30.811 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND OUR REGIONAL.

01:52:28.542 --> 01:52:31.678 region:rollup2
COGS OUT THERE THAT HAVE A

01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:33.247 region:rollup2

WE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:40.454 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO ABOUT. YOU

01:52:38.085 --> 01:52:42.256 region:rollup2
KNOW THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR

01:52:40.454 --> 01:52:43.657 region:rollup2
REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES TO

HELP IN THIS MEET SOME OF OUR

01:52:43.657 --> 01:52:47.361 region:rollup2
REDUCTION GOALS. OVERALL IN

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:48.028 region:rollup2
THINK THIS ALL FALLS IN LINE

01:52:47.361 --> 01:52:50.063 region:rollup2
WITH THE CONVERSATION.

01:52:48.028 --> 01:52:51.498 region:rollup2
THE WAR HAVE BEEN.

BEING ABLE TO MEASURE YOU KNOW

01:52:56.336 --> 01:53:00.407 region:rollup2
OUR EFFORTS INVESTMENTS IN A

01:52:58.872 --> 01:53:02.542 region:rollup2
PLACE LIKE IMPERIAL COUNTY THAT

01:53:00.407 --> 01:53:04.745 region:rollup2
HAS SIGNIFICANTLY. A POOR AIR

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:06.013 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND THE HIGH LEVELS OF

01:53:04.745 --> 01:53:07.414 region:rollup2
COURSE THE OUTCOME OF THAT

01:53:06.013 --> 01:53:09.316 region:rollup2
MEANING HIGH LEVELS OF

01:53:07.414 --> 01:53:11.985 region:rollup2
RESPIRATORY DISEASE. PROBLEMS

01:53:09.316 --> 01:53:14.621 region:rollup2
AMONGST CHILDREN AND ADULTS YOU

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:15.122 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'D LOVE TO GET YOUR TAKE

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:16.590 region:rollup2
ON HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO

01:53:15.122 --> 01:53:18.725 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:20.560 region:rollup2
.

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:21.895 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION GAP AS IT

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:24.131 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THE INVESTMENTS MEAN

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:26.133 region:rollup2
MADE AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE

01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:27.968 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THAT REDUCING. YOU KNOW

01:53:26.133 --> 01:53:30.003 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF VISITS TO THE

01:53:27.968 --> 01:53:31.772 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM BAD THAT ARE

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:33.373 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS

01:53:31.772 --> 01:53:34.741 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING YOU KINDA MAYBE

ELABORATE AND SEE.

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:39.012 region:rollup2
WHAT OTHER WAYS THAT WE'RE ABLE

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:40.847 region:rollup2
TO INTEGRATE SOME KIND OF

01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:42.282 region:rollup2
BENCHMARKS FOR US TO BE ABLE? TO

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:44.384 region:rollup2
DETERMINE YOU KNOW OUTCOMES OF

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:44.985 region:rollup2
OUR EFFORTS.

01:53:44.384 --> 01:53:47.054 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:48.889 region:rollup2
WE DID AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:53:47.054 --> 01:53:50.057 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES AND THE DISADVANTAGES

01:53:48.889 --> 01:53:51.324 region:rollup2
TO WE DO HAVE.

01:53:50.057 --> 01:53:52.659 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:53.226 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON HEALTH ON

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:55.295 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR HEALTH INDICATORS

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:57.431 region:rollup2
AND.

01:53:55.295 --> 01:53:59.800 region:rollup2
SUE AND WE HAVE SOME TOOLS TO

01:53:57.431 --> 01:54:01.868 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FOLLOW THOSE OUT BUT

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:03.470 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY RA AD IN CURRENT

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:05.672 region:rollup2
STATE SO FOR EXAMPLE EMERGENCY

01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:07.207 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT VISITS WERE. ACTIVELY

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:09.376 region:rollup2
WORKING RIGHT NOW TO PURSUE THE.

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:11.678 region:rollup2
THE IT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED

01:54:09.376 --> 01:54:12.279 region:rollup2
TO HAVE MUCH MORE REAL TIME

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:13.213 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WE'RE SORT OF ALWAYS

01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:13.814 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:15.782 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE FROM.

01:54:13.814 --> 01:54:17.084 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE LUCKY A MONTH TO SIX

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:19.086 region:rollup2
MONTHS BEHIND TO WE CAN DO LOTS

01:54:17.084 --> 01:54:20.787 region:rollup2
OF RETROSPECTIVE LOOKING AT.

01:54:19.086 --> 01:54:22.622 region:rollup2
TRENDS OVER TIME AND TRYING TO

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:24.358 region:rollup2
DRAW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:26.793 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT.

01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:29.029 region:rollup2
AN ADVANTAGE THAT WE HAVE IS

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:30.530 region:rollup2
WITH OF THE VARIOUS NOW METRICS

01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:31.832 region:rollup2
OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WERE

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:33.567 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER

01:54:31.832 --> 01:54:35.902 region:rollup2
BOTH. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

01:54:33.567 --> 01:54:37.137 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HEALTH CONDITIONS AND

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:39.139 region:rollup2
OTHER OTHER.

01:54:37.137 --> 01:54:40.907 region:rollup2
ASPECTS THAT WE KNOW CONTRIBUTE

01:54:39.139 --> 01:54:43.276 region:rollup2
TO OVERALL HEALTH THINGS LIKE.

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:45.045 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS IN EDUCATION AS WE'VE

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:47.447 region:rollup2
BUILT THESE SORT OF COMPOUNDED

01:54:45.045 --> 01:54:48.915 region:rollup2
INDICATORS OF HEALTH WE CAN

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:50.217 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL

01:54:48.915 --> 01:54:51.985 region:rollup2
PRESSURES THAT MAY MOVE THAT

01:54:50.217 --> 01:54:53.553 region:rollup2
OVER ON THAT INCLUDES THINGS

01:54:51.985 --> 01:54:54.921 region:rollup2
LIKE CRAPPIE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:56.490 region:rollup2
EFFECTS TOO. FOR.

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:58.558 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:54:56.490 --> 01:54:59.860 region:rollup2
MONITORING HOW COMMUNITIES ARE

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:01.962 region:rollup2
DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR CHRONIC

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:04.464 region:rollup2
DISEASE AFTER OF AFTER ACUTE

01:55:01.962 --> 01:55:05.999 region:rollup2
EVENTS IS HELPING US TO PREDICT

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:09.035 region:rollup2
WHAT WE MIGHT SEE.

01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:10.537 region:rollup2
IN COMMUNITIES AFTER NOON KNEW

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:12.139 region:rollup2
ABOUT SO EVERYTHING WE LEARNED

01:55:10.537 --> 01:55:13.507 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TROUT FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:55:12.139 --> 01:55:15.542 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE IDEAS OF WHAT THINGS

01:55:13.507 --> 01:55:18.612 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE IN PLACE. AND THEN WE

01:55:15.542 --> 01:55:20.781 region:rollup2
CAN MEASURE THAT PROACTIVELY

01:55:18.612 --> 01:55:22.449 region:rollup2
THROUGH A NEW EVENTS BUT REALLY

01:55:20.781 --> 01:55:24.451 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE. I

01:55:22.449 --> 01:55:25.986 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE SORT OF THREE YEARS

01:55:24.451 --> 01:55:27.721 region:rollup2
THREE TO FIVE YEARS FROM REALLY

01:55:25.986 --> 01:55:30.056 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZING THE DATA THAT'S

01:55:27.721 --> 01:55:30.624 region:rollup2
INTERIOR AVAILABLE. I'M SO THAT

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:32.626 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

01:55:30.624 --> 01:55:34.561 region:rollup2
GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS

01:55:32.626 --> 01:55:34.961 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE TO TIE AT LEAST HEALTH

01:55:34.561 --> 01:55:35.428 region:rollup2
A FAX.

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:37.264 region:rollup2
TO.

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:39.099 region:rollup2
THE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:55:37.264 --> 01:55:41.134 region:rollup2
AND RESILIENCY OBVIOUSLY WE

01:55:39.099 --> 01:55:42.702 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE TO SEE. YOU IF WE CAN

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:44.004 region:rollup2
PROJECT WHAT WE THINK WE MIGHT

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:46.006 region:rollup2
SEE AND WE SEE LASSEN A

01:55:44.004 --> 01:55:47.374 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT HAS INVESTED A

01:55:46.006 --> 01:55:48.008 region:rollup2
LOT IN RESILIENCE WE MAY

01:55:47.374 --> 01:55:50.210 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TIE SOME OF

01:55:48.008 --> 01:55:53.079 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:55.215 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY OTHER. DATA.

01:59:18.018 --> 01:59:21.488 region:rollup2
CAYLEY'S POINTS AND I THINK THE

01:59:19.653 --> 01:59:23.523 region:rollup2
KEY IS IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE'RE

01:59:21.488 --> 01:59:24.624 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR A DIFFERENT FUTURE

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THE FUTURE'S GONNA

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:26.860 region:rollup2
LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE PAST AND

EVEN MORE CRITICAL.

01:59:41.808 --> 01:59:45.979 region:rollup2

VARIOUS ASPECTS AND THAT REALLY

01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:00.794 region:rollup2

ADDITIONAL STORAGE.

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:10.396 region:rollup2
FOR OUR WATER BECAUSE WATER

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:21.934 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE IT THE.

02:12:20.199 --> 02:12:23.569 region:rollup2
NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN A

02:12:21.934 --> 02:12:25.204 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE HAD SOME LEVEL OF

02:12:23.569 --> 02:12:27.673 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AROUND THIS IS THAT

02:12:25.204 --> 02:12:30.176 region:rollup2
ARE HAVING AN INVENTORY OF LANDS

02:12:27.673 --> 02:12:32.311 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC LINES TO SEE. HOW?

02:12:30.176 --> 02:12:33.779 region:rollup2
THOSE AGENCIES WHO ARE

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:35.514 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:36.916 region:rollup2
IN MANAGING THEM ARE.

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:37.550 region:rollup2
ADAPTING.

02:12:36.916 --> 02:12:39.919 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:42.555 region:rollup2
CHANGING CLIMATE AS WE AS WE

02:12:39.919 --> 02:12:44.223 region:rollup2
START TO SEE OF THE POPULATION.

02:12:42.555 --> 02:12:47.760 region:rollup2
AS WE SAW.

02:12:44.223 --> 02:12:48.027 region:rollup2
IN ONE OF OUR RECENT STUDIES.

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:48.894 region:rollup2
.

02:12:48.027 --> 02:12:50.963 region:rollup2
THE HABITAT.

02:12:48.894 --> 02:12:52.698 region:rollup2
CHANGING IN MIGRATE NORTHWARD

02:12:50.963 --> 02:12:54.200 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT HAVING SO

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:56.001 region:rollup2
SOME SOME OF THOSE INVENTORIES

02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.870 region:rollup2
ON PUBLIC LANDS. ASIDE I THINK

02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:58.471 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR US

02:12:57.870 --> 02:13:02.007 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO.

02:12:58.471 --> 02:13:04.276 region:rollup2
MAY MANAGE AND AND AND HELP THE

02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:05.711 region:rollup2
AGENCIES REALLY TRY TO COME UP

02:13:04.276 --> 02:13:09.982 region:rollup2
