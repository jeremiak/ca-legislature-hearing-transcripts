STABILITY PUBLIC SAFETY AND

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.608
ESPECIALLY WATER. IT IS MY HOPE

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:56.876
THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN TRULY

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.344
SHED LIGHT ON THE NEGLECTED

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.179
PROBLEMS IMPACTING SO MANY

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.681
PEOPLE. IN INDUSTRIES IN OUR

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.216
STATE AND HOW THE POLICIES WE

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.184
ENACT HERE MAY EXACERBATE OR

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.653
HELP SOLVE. THOSE PROBLEMS AND

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.155
LIKE YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.157
VERY LARGE AGRICULTURAL AREA IN

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.992
MY DISTRICT. THAT RELIES ON

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.094
SUSTAINABLE WATER SUPPLY TO GROW

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.395
ALL OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:17.730
AND THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO EAT

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.532
IN CALIFORNIA AND SENT TO OTHER

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.868
STATES. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.236
STATE WATER COMMISSION APPROVAL

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:24.737
OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE SITES

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.405
RESERVOIR PROJECT THAT WILL

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:27.340
PROVIDE THE NECESSARY

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.941
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO AVOID

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:32.011
DROUGHTS AND WATER SHORTAGES BUT

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:32.612
WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT MORE IS

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.180
NEEDED. THOSE FARMS EMPLOYED

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.148
THOUSANDS OF WORKERS EVERY YEAR.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.683
BUT WITHOUT WATER THOSE FIELDS

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.151
REMAIN FALLOW AND ARE FROM

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.454
WORKERS KILLING HIM FLOYD. THIS

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.855
ONE EXAMPLE THE LACK OF WATER

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.524
AFFECTS NOT JUST THE FOOD BEING

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.791
GROWN IN THESE AREAS BUT THE

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.894
ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF ENTIRE

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.329
COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT JOBS

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:51.631
WORKERS CAN'T PROVIDE FOOD FOR

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.199
THEIR FAMILIES OR HOMES OR FOR

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.767
THEIR CHILDREN ARE HOME FOR

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.869
THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP IN. SO

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:57.870
IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.505
MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS IN THIS

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.507
COMMITTEE ABOUT THESE TOPICS.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:02.909
AND SEE HOW WE AS POLICYMAKERS

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.343
CAN LESSEN THE BURDEN SO MANY

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.379
CALIFORNIANS FACE. STARTING A

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.980
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS HARD

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.116
AND IT IS GROWING INCREASINGLY

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.717
ON AND TRACK UNATTRACTIVE TO

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:13.452
ENTREPRENEURS WHICH IS WHY WE

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.787
SEE BUSINESSES FLEEING OUR

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.455
STATE. EVEN AS EXISTING

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:17.890
BUSINESSES SUFFER FROM LOOTING

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:21.227
AND RANDOM ACTS OF CRIME. THAT

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.361
TOO OFTEN GO UNPUNISHED. AND

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.195
THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE LACK

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.164
OF GROCERY STORES CONTRIBUTING

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.532
TO FOOD AND SECURITY BUT AS

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.900
CRIMINAL ACCOUNT ACTIVITY

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.635
CONTINUES TO RISE MORE OF THESE

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.504
STORES ARE GOING TO REFUSE TO GO

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.805
INTO THESE COMMUNITIES WHO SO

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.574
DESPERATELY NEED THEIR SERVICES.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.109
WE CANNOT HAVE A VIABLE ECONOMY

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.945
WITHOUT JOBS WE CANNOT SOLVE

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.012
FOOD INSECURITY WITHOUT

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.214
BUSINESSES FEELING SAFE AND IN

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:43.749
ORDERTO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:46.419
WE HAVE TO HAVE A HOLISTIC

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:46.953
APPROACH TO IMPROVING OUR

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.821
BUSINESS CLIMATE. HOUSING IS

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:50.423
UNAFFORDABLE PARTIALLY BECAUSE

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:52.024
ALL OF ALL THE COSTS WHICH

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:53.859
INCLUDE LABOR AND THE PERMITTING

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.428
IN THE ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.363
IMPACT REPORTS EQUAL EDUCATION

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.831
GREEN BUILDING INITIATIVES AND

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.833
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. AND ALL

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.767
THESE THINGS GOING TO PLANNING

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.003
AND DEVELOPMENT BEFORE SHOVEL IS

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.905
EVEN TURNING THE EARTH. AN

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.007
ENERGY IS EXPENSIVE IN ALL OF

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.508
CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN MY

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:10.843
DISTRICT BECAUSE IT'S

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.644
PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.412
CALIFORNIA OF COURSE. YOU KNOW

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.814
WE NEED AIR CONDITIONING IN THE

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.048
IN THE DESERT PART OF MY

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:18.584
DISTRICT IT'S- A HUNDRED AND

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:19.385
TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN THE SUMMER

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.786
PEOPLE CAN'T GO WITHOUT AIR

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:21.854
CONDITIONING BUT OF COURSE THAT

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.557
PLAYS. PLACES A LARGE BURDEN ON

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.425
OUR ELECTRICAL GRID. WE HAVE

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:27.893
TRIED TO USE AN INCENTIVIZED

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.729
GREEN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.897
AND SOLAR WHICH WE HAVE MUCH OF.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:33.132
IN MY DISTRICT BUT THEY SIMPLY

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.667
DON'T PRODUCE ENOUGH ENERGY WHEN

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.435
THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING. OR THE

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.170
SUN ISN'T SHINING SECRETING AN

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:39.805
ENERGY RELIANCE AND OTHER STATES

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.107
AND MAKING ELECTRICITY MORE

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.376
EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS. IS

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.077
LIKELY NOT THE PATH WE WANT TO

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.079
CONTINUE DOWN. CALIFORNIANS

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.414
DESERVE TO HAVE A RELIABLE

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.383
ENERGY GRID SYSTEM AND SO I DO

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:51.484
HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.418
TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THE

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.286
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US. TO

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:55.721
ENSURE THAT ROLLING BLACKOUTS

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.523
BECOME LESS FREQUENT IF NOT.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.226
NONEXISTENT AS A COST OF GOODS

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:01.460
AND SERVICES CONTINUE TO

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:02.895
INCREASE DUE TO INFLATION I

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:03.863
THINK THE TIMING OF THIS

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.865
HEARING. AND THE MANY TOPICS WE

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.600
WILL COVER THIS SESSION WILL BE

00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.135
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKING

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:10.803
CALIFORNIA MORE SAFE AND

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.705
AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE. SO I

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:13.606
DO LOOK FORWARD TO OUR

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:14.707
DISCUSSION TODAY ON WATER TO

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:15.608

BROUGHT FORWARD CAN BE ADDRESSED

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:18.577
IN THE FUTURE. TO ENSURE

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.579
COMMUNITIES CAN BE VIABLE PLACES

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.081

HISTORY OF THE MORE OF THE MOST

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:18.898
RECENT DROUGHT AND WHAT WE CAN

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.332
LEARN FROM IT DONE SOME

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.901
BACKGROUND ON THE DROUGHT WE'RE

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.736

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.304
TALK ABOUT SOME FACTORS THAT

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.273
EXACERBATE DROUGHT IMPACTS WHY

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.408
IS IT GOTTEN SO BAD SO FAST.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.877
THIS TIME AND THEN- HIGH LEVEL

SUMMARY OF SOME RECENT

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:37.583
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. SO FIRST

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.219
THIS IS THE GRAPH OF OUR

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.987
PRECIPITATION OVER THE PAST

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:43.122
FIFTY YEARS AND YOU CAN SEE

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.456
THERE ARE LOTS OF UPS AND DOWNS

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:45.824
OF DROUGHT IS NOTHING NEW IN

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:48.694
CALIFORNIA- BUT I THINK WHAT I'D

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.895

PERIOD. WE TALK ABOUT HAVING A

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.638
SERIOUS DROUGHT BETWEEN TWO

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:00.873
THOUSAND TWELVE AND SIXTEEN AND

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.875
THEN NOW AGAIN IN TWENTY AND

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.510
TWENTY ONE. BUT ANOTHER WAY TO

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.045
THINK ABOUT IT IS WE'VE HAD A

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.448
REALLY DRY FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.050
FIVE WAIT YEARS SPRINKLED

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:13.018
THROUGHOUT THERE. SO I THINK

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:14.687
THAT SOME HELPFUL PERSPECTIVE TO

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:16.789
THINK ABOUT CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:19.225
AND- WELL YOU KNOW AGAIN WHY

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.993
THINGS GOT SO BAD SO QUICKLY

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.128
HERE IS THAT WE REALLY HAVE HAD

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.930
A PRETTY DRY PERIOD OVER THE

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.765
PAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO.

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.133
LUCKILY IF YOU WAIT YEARS IN

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.071
BETWEEN THERE BUT BUT BUT IT

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:32.671
DOES HAVE CUMULATIVE CHANCE OF

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.773
SACKS- SERVICE I JUST HIGHLIGHTS

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.710
THE LAST DROUGHT AND YOU CAN SEE

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.678
HOW IT PROGRESSED AND GOT WORSE

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.348
INSTEAD OF BUNCH OF RECORDS. I'M

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:46.485
NOT POSITIVE ONES. I HAD TWO

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.119
THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:47.620
FIFTEEN WAS THE DRIEST

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.121
CONSECUTIVE FOUR YEAR STRETCH ON

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.490
RECORD. AND TWO THOUSAND

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.491
FOURTEEN WAS THE THIRD DRIEST

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.226
YEAR ON RECORD AT THE TIME IN

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:57.529
TERMS OF PRECIPITATION- SO

00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:00.933
PRETTY SEVERE DROUGHT. SO AT A

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.968
HIGH LEVEL SOME OF THE MOST

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:04.637
SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS FROM THAT

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:07.439
DROUGHT WERE. THAT THOUSANDS OF

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:08.974
HOUSEHOLDS LOSING WATER THEIR

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.043
DOMESTIC WELLS GOING DRY OR

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.746
BECOMING CONTAMINATED. THAT VERY

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.514
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SURFACE

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.116
WATER DELIVERIES FROM OUR STATE

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.084
AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS WHICH

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.286
LED TO A DECREASE IN

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.955
AGRICULTURAL CROP. CROP

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:24.790
PRODUCTION AS WAS REFERENCED BY

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.558
ON BOTH OF YOUR SENATORS IN YOUR

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.593
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS AND I'M

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.861
SURE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN YOUR

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:32.097
SUBSEQUENT PANELS- WHAT ACTS OF

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:35.334
BATCH- WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.902
ALWAYS USED OUR GROUNDWATER IS

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:39.171
OUR SAVINGS BANK WHEN WE HAVE

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:40.606
DRY YEARS WE GO WITH THE DRAW

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.241
FROM OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN THE

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.209
GROUND AND THEN IN WHAT YEARS.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.445
REPLENISH BUT BECAUSE OF THE

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:47.546
SEVERITY OF THE DROUGHT AND

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.981
AGAIN SOME OF THESE CUMULATIVE

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.649
IMPACTS WE HAVEN'T BEEN

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.985
REPLENISHING- SIGNIFICANTLY OR

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.386
UP TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.654
BEEN PUMPING WHICH IS LED TO

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.324
OVER DRAFT IN SOME AREAS AND

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.326
SOME SIDE ENDS WITH THE GROUND.

00:16:00.392 --> 00:16:02.394
YOU KNOW DROPPING AND CAUSING

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:06.432
DAMAGE AND WE SAW THAT- VERY

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:06.965
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:07.599
DROUGHT. IN THE URBAN SAID THE

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.867
BIGGEST IMPACT IN THE LAST ROUTE

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.469
WAS INCREASED CONSERVATION

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.104
REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS TO USE

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.207
LAST GOVERNOR BROWN. HAD A 25%

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.408
MANDATORY REDUCTION DURING THE

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:19.645
LAST DROUGHT AND WE SAW THAT

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.046
WHERE YOU STRAP AND NOT SOME OF

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:23.048
THAT WATER USE DROP HAS BEEN

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.483
SUSTAINED SINCE THEN THERE WERE

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.984
SOME PERMANENT REDUCTIONS FROM

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:27.786
THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW TAKING OUT

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.655
LINES ARE REPLACING SHOWER HEADS

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:30.823
ARE TOILETS IN URBAN SETTINGS

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.191
WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THAT

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:35.027
REDUCTION IN USE OF SUSTAINED.

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:35.994
DURING THE LAST YEAR WE HAD

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:38.030
SEVERAL VERY SEVERE WILDFIRES

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.799
THAT WERE. FUELED IN PART BY A

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.868
HISTORIC TREE DIE OFF IN OUR

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:45.270
FORESTS. WE LOST A HUNDRED AND

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.872
TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES THAT

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.707
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND TWO

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.376
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. FROM DRY

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:52.444
CONDITIONS AND THAT CONTRIBUTED

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:56.215
TO A- WIDE SCALE INFESTATION OF.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.484
BARK BEETLES WHICH KILLED-

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.485
CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THAT TREE

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.487
DIE OFF. AND THAT CERTAINLY

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.789
CONTRIBUTED TO THOSE FIRES- AND

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.457
THEN I HAVE SOME PRETTY SEVERE

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:08.227
IMPACTS TO HABITAT IN PARTICULAR

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:11.530
PRODUCT HABITATS FOR FISH AND

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.164
WILDLIFE AS WELL DURING THE LAST

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.100
DROUGHT. SO IN RESPONSE TO THAT

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.335
THE LEGISLATURE TOOK SOME PRETTY

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:20.773
SIGNIFICANT. ACTIONS DURING THE

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.306
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:21.940
THOUSAND SIXTEEN DROUGHT AND IN

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:23.242
A COUPLE YEARS FOLLOWING THAT

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.042
THAT I THINK ARE REALLY

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.377
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:27.579
THEY ARE INFLUENCING THE

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:30.816
CONDITIONS WERE IN RIGHT NOW- SO

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.785
THE FIRST WAS. VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:34.353
FUNDING A LOT OF IT FROM

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.021
PROPOSITION ONE WHICH VOTERS

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:38.490
PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:39.391
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR WATER

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.161
SUPPLY AND STORAGE. SO THAT WHY

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:44.263
THAT THOSE FUNDS HAVE WERE

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:46.732
APPROPRIATED MOST NOT ALL BUT

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.400
MOST DURING THE LAST DROUGHT BUT

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.401
THOSE PROJECTS TAKE A LONG TIME

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:51.437
TO. KIND OF GET PERMITTED GET

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.105
CONSTRUCTED GET GET ON THE

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.340
GROUND SO- I THINK WE'RE

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:56.875
STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.677
FRUITS OF THOSE PROJECTS NOW IS

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.979
THAT SOME OF THEM ARE STARTING

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.714
TO BE COMPLETED. TWO THOUSAND

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:03.682
FOURTEEN ALSO SOUGHT PASSAGE OF

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:04.550
THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.618
MANAGEMENT ACT OR SIGMA WHICH

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.620
WAS THAT HISTORICAL AS AS YOU

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:11.790
ARE NOW- FIRST STATEWIDE EFFORT

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:13.692
TO REGULATE GROUNDWATER. THERE

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.527
WAS ALSO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.162
WATER CONSERVATION LEGISLATION A

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:19.498
LITTLE BIT LATER TWO THOUSAND

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.899
EIGHTEEN TO TRY AND SUSTAIN SOME

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.434
OF THAT BUT GOALS AND TARGETS

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.902
THAT WERE SET UP DURING THE LAST

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:25.370
ROUND AND LEAD TO MORE.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.873
PERMANENT WATER EFFICIENCY

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.242
PRACTICES. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:30.876
NINETEEN WE STOPPED PASSAGE OF

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:31.977
THE SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.112
WATER FUND LEGISLATION SB TWO

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.047
HUNDRED WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:36.181
AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.684
ANNUALLY FOR TEN YEARS. FOR A

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.685
DRESSING SOME OF THE DRINKING

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.220
WATER ISSUES THAT WE SAW

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.454
HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE LAST

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.655
DROUGHT I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.390
DROUGHT EXACERBATED TO SOME OF

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.125
THOSE DRINKING WATER ISSUES BUT

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.093
SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY LONG

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.728
STANDING ISSUES. THAT WERE JUST

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.697
HIGHLIGHTED. DURING THE LAST

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.565
ROUTE SO THAT THAT NEW PROGRAM

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.933
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TO TRY

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.201
AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE LONG

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:59.338
TERM ISSUES ARE WITH SAFE

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.272
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IT

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.407
WAS ALSO LEGISLATION PASSED THAT

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.308
PROVIDED THE STATE WITH

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.810
AUTHORITY NEW AUTHORITIES TO

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.512
HELP CONSOLIDATE SOME WATER

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.280
SYSTEMS POORLY PERFORMING WATER

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.249
SYSTEMS. IN CASES WHERE

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.683
VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS ARE

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.218
HAPPENING THE STATE NOW HAS

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.786
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO TRY AND

00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:16.788
MAKE THOSE HAPPEN IN ORDER TO

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.624
ENSURE THAT. PARTICULARLY SOME

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.359
OF THE SMALLER MORE RURAL WATER

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:22.761
SYSTEMS. THAT JUST DON'T MAKE

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.396
SENSE TO OPERATE AND AREN'T

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.398
FUNCTIONING WELL ON THEIR OWN

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.367
CAN BE PART OF A LARGER SYSTEM-

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:29.468
AND THEN FINALLY SOME NEW

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:30.736
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.671
LEGISLATURE ENACTED FOR WATER

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.006
USERS JUST SO WE CAN GET A

00:19:34.072 --> 00:19:35.140
BETTER SENSE OF THIS IS AS A

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.442
STATE. AS A STATE OF WHO'S USING

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.877
HOW MUCH WATER WHERE THAT REALLY

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.379
HELPS INFORM WHEN THERE ARE

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.714
CURTAILMENTS- NEEDED JUST TO GET

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.416
A BETTER SENSE. SO I HAD A

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:47.052
LADIES IN PART BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.687
HELPING US HOPEFULLY IN THE

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.155
CURRENT DROUGHT BUT ALSO JUST TO

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:52.090
HIGHLIGHT THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:52.958
THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.160
EMERGENCY THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.596
THE STATE AND LEGISLATURE CAN DO

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:58.764
OTHER THAN THE EMERGENCY

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.865
RESPONSE YOU KNOW GETTING

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:00.933
BOTTLES OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.535
I DON'T HAVE THEM. BUT IT REALLY

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.437
WHAT. IS IMPORTANT TO KIND OF

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:08.040
HAVE THAT I. ON WHAT'S THE NEXT

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:09.675
ROUTE THAT WILL COME IN FUTURE

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:11.009
YEARS WHAT CAN WE DO NOW BECAUSE

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.377
SOME OF THESE CHANGES REALLY DO

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:14.046
TAKE A LONG TIME TO PUT IN PLACE

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:16.081
WHETHER IT'S- PROVIDING FUNDING

00:20:16.148 --> 00:20:19.151
FOR. A NEW WATER RECYCLING.

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:21.386
FACILITY TO INCREASE WATER

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:25.891
SUPPLY- OR OR CONSOLIDATING

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:26.892
WATER SYSTEMS YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.894
CAN'T HAPPEN WITHIN A WEEK OR A

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.229
MONTH THAT TAKES YEARS AND SO.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.497
SOME OF THE POLICY SETTING UP

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:33.999
NEW WATER CONSERVATION TARGETS

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.467
YOU KNOW THESE THESE TYPES OF

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:37.936
EFFORTS CAN TAKE YEARS. SO

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:39.004
LUCKILY WE HAD SOME OF THE

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.205
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS DURING THE

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.206
LAST STRAW THAT HAVE WE'RE

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.641
HELPING US NOW BUT I THINK IT'S

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.242
IMPORTANT THING FOR. THE

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:45.711
LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND I

00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:47.646
HAVE- THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:52.284
KIND OF A LONGER. TERM VIEW AND

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:52.884
THEN SOME OF THESE CASES. TEN

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.186
OUT TO THE DROUGHT WERE IN MIDST

00:20:54.252 --> 00:20:56.655
OF IT NOW- AT TWO THOUSAND

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.823
TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE OR GET

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:59.291
EXCEPTIONALLY WARM AND

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:02.094
EXCEPTIONALLY DRY- WE- WE BROKE

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.929
THE RECORD AGAIN WITH TWO

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:04.963
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE- IN TERMS OF

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.632
PRECIPITATION OUTS THE THIRD

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:09.701
DRIEST. ON RECORD THE SECOND

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.569
DRIEST BASED ON HOW MUCH RUNOFF

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:13.105
WE HAD. SO IN RESPONSE TO

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.439
GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.274
EMERGENCY I THINK ACTUALLY THREE

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:17.643
DIFFERENT STATES OF EMERGENCY

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.544
ADDING ADDITIONAL COUNTIES. IN

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.781
EACH ONE SO THAT NOW EVERY EVERY

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:23.849
FIFTEEN ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:24.683
COUNTIES IS COVERED BY THE

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.352
STATEWIDE- DROUGHT STATE OF

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:30.088
EMERGENCY. THIS FIGURE HERE IT

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:32.391
SHOWS YOU ABOUT WATER RUNOFF-

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:34.192
EXCUSE ME- WATER FLOW FOR

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.894
VARIOUS RIVERS IN THE STATE AS

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:37.663
OF SEPTEMBER SO IT'S NOT CREDITS

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:39.264
IT'S A FEW MONTHS OLD. BUT I

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.599
THINK THE IMPORTANT THING TO SEE

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.334
HERE IS IF YOU LOOK IN THE LEFT

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.102
COLUMN SAYS TWO THOUSAND

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:47.506
FOURTEEN. THE MIDDLE EAST TWO

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.141
THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND THE RATE IS

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:50.642
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. SO

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.543
FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN WHERE THE

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.111
FOURTH AND FIFTH YEARS EIGHT OF

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:56.181
THE OF THE LAST DROUGHT- THIRTY

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:57.749
FOURTH YEARS YOU KNOW THE LATTER

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:01.286
END OF THE LAST DROUGHT. AND TWO

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:01.920
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IS ONLY THE

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.888
SECOND YEAR OF THIS TRIAL AND

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.790
IT'S ALREADY AT AT COMPARABLY

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:06.825
LOW LEVEL SO I THINK THAT POINT

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:08.360
TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS. IS AGAIN

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:09.661
HOW QUICKLY IT GOT BAD WE'RE

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.096
ONLY IN YEAR TWO OF THIS DROUGHT

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.699
BUT IT- THAT THE LEVELS GOT

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.367
PRETTY BAD PRETTY QUICKLY. I'LL

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:20.038
TALK IN A MINUTE. ABOUT WHY THAT

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.473
MIGHT BE- SO TURN TO LOOK AT

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.241
SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.743
CURRENT DROUGHT AND AGAIN I KNOW

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.211
YOUR PAIN NEXT COUNCIL GET INTO

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:27.546
MUCH MORE DETAIL BUT JUST AT A

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:29.347
HIGH LEVEL. AGAIN WE'VE SEEN

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:30.549
SURFACE WATER ALLOCATIONS

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:32.684
DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE STATE

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:35.187
WATER PROJECT ONLY DELIVERED 5%

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:37.422
OF THAT CONTRACT AMOUNTS. LAST

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:39.391
YEAR AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.827
NO WATER DELIVERIES FOR SOME OF

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:44.129
THE- AGRICULTURAL. CONTRACTORS

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:47.032
SOUTH OF THE DELTA SH- WE SAY

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.600
GROUNDWATER LEVELS DROPPING

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:49.935
AGAIN SO THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:52.704
PICTURE HERE IN THE SLIDE SHOWS-

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.540
THIS IS A COMPARISON OF SPRING

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:56.007
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.943
GROUNDWATER LEVELS SO. THE

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.811
CONCLUSION OF THE LOVE THAT.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:00.946
STRAIGHT AFTER WE HAD A COUPLE

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.081
OF THOSE REALLY WENT YEARS IN

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:05.817
SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. SO SPRING

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:06.384
TWENTY EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.086
SPRING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:11.490
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS- ALL OF

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.092
THAT RED AND ORANGE TRIANGLES

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.094
AND BARS UP IN THE CORNER. OUR

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.063
GROUNDWATER BASINS THAT DECLINES

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.364
TO THE ROUND WATER LEVELS

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:23.101
DROPPED BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:23.735
TWENTY ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.103
AND TWENTY ONE. SO IT'S ONLY

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.472
ABOUT A THIRD ABOUT 30% OF THESE

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:28.807
MONITORING WELLS SHOWED LOWER

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.777
LEVELS BUT- BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.812
JUST OVER THAT SHORT. AND WE'RE

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.480
ALREADY DO YOU KNOW JUST TWO

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.515
YEARS IN THE DISTRAUGHT WE'RE

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.250
ALREADY SEEING DECLINES IN THE

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.218
GROUNDWATER LEVELS. AND THIS WAS

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.920
FROM THE SPRING SO IT DOESN'T

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:44.089
EVEN INCLUDE USAGE THAT HAPPENED

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:46.024
IN THIS VERY HOT SUMMER OF

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:46.591
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE CAN

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:48.760
ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEXT- SET OF

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:53.698
READINGS WILL. WILL SHOW EVEN

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:54.566
FURTHER DECLINES. AT ONE POINT

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:56.234
TO JUST MAKE IS THE- AND I THIS

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:57.369
WAS IN THE QUITE A BIT SO YOU

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:59.237
MAY HAVE SEEN THIS. AT LEAST

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:00.272
DURING THE SUMMER THE WATER

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:01.573
CONDITIONS IN SOME CALIFORNIA

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.575
ARE ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER THAN IN

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.310
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:07.145
WHICH- MIGHT SEEM SURPRISING

00:24:07.212 --> 00:24:08.246
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MOST OF OUR

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:09.648
PRECIPITATION ACTUALLY FALLS IN

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:11.049
THE NORTH SO WHY WAS IT BETTER

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.184
IN THE SOUTH COMPARED TO THE

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.585
NORTH. SH I THINK PART OF THE

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.420
STORY THERE WAS RELATED TO THOSE

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:16.888
INVESTMENTS THAT WE STOP FROM

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.424
PROPOSITION ONE. A FEW YEARSAGO

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.959
THERE THERE HAD BEEN A LIST HAVE

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.127
BEEN A LOT OF SPENDING A LOT OF

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:23.228
INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.030
CALIFORNIA IN BOTH ALTERNATIVE

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.632
WATER SUPPLIES- LIKE WATER

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.035
RECYCLING AT AND ALSO STORAGE.

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:32.637
AND SO BAD THEY THEY HAD BETTER

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.806
WATER WATER SUPPLIES ON HAND

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.775
THAT IN IN THE SUMMER. THAT

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.176
STARTED CHANGING AND THE LONGER

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:41.479
THAT THE DRY PERIOD WAS GOING

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.648
ALONG. AGAIN JUST TALKING ABOUT

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:44.482
SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:46.218
RECENT DROUGHT WE ARE SEEING

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.086
HOUSEHOLDWATER SHORTAGES AGAIN

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.155
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS GRAPH SHOWS.

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.756
THESE ARE HOUSEHOLD WATER

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:52.958
SHORTAGES REPORTED TO THE

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:55.560
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES.

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.462
SO YOU CAN HAVE WE WOULD

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:58.530
ANTICIPATE THIS IS PROBABLY

00:24:58.597 --> 00:24:59.998
UNDER COUNTING BECAUSE NOT

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.868
EVERYBODY CALLS OF THAT STATE TO

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:03.702
TELL THEM. WHEN THEY'RE WELL

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:06.037
GOES DRY. BUT BUT THIS REFLECTS

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:07.172
THE REPORTED SHOULD THAT

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.573
REPORTING THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.508
DID GET SO I YOU CAN SEE THE

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.544
HIGH SPIKES IN TWO THOUSAND

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.646
FOURTEEN. OR SIXTEEN. AND THEN

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:16.948
NOT SO MANY SEVENTEEN THROUGH

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:19.251
TWENTY AND THEN NOW IN TWO

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:19.851
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND WE'RE

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:21.386
SEEING. A LOT MORE REPORTS OF

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:25.357
CASH FAST DRY WELLS BEGAN

00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:27.792
HOUSEHOLD SHORTAGES- ALL SEEN WE

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:28.894
ALL KNOW ABOUT THE SEVERE

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.495
WILDFIRES THAT BREAKING RECORDS

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:32.063
AGAIN THIS SUMMER FROM DRY

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.765
CONDITIONS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTED

00:25:33.832 --> 00:25:35.500
TO BY THE DROUGHT. AND THEN

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.302
AGAIN REALLY HIGH FISH MORTALITY

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.637
I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:40.372
FOCUSED ON HUMAN IMPACTS BUT I

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:41.473
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:42.374
THAT THE HEALTH OF THE

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.176
ECOSYSTEMS- AND FOOD WEBS.

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:46.978
CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH OF

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.014
HUMANS AS WELL BUT ALSO OF

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.315
COURSE THE HUMANS WHO WORK IN

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.183
THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND NATIVE

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.352
AMERICAN TRIBES FOR HIM YOU KNOW

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.754
SALMON ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.589
CULTURAL RESOURCE FOR EXAMPLE-

00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.458
CERTAINLY AFFECTIVE BI- THE

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:03.261
HEALTH OF OR ECOSYSTEMS AND

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:04.696
NATIVE FISH SPECIES AS WELL. SO

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.765
WHY DID THE DRIVER GET SO BAD SO

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.401
QUICKLY. TEMPERATURES ARE A BIG

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:10.936
PART OF IT WE BROKE RECORDS THIS

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.537
SUMMER FOR THE HIGHEST

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.072
TEMPERATURES FOR JUNE JULY AND

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.341
AUGUST ON ON RECORD. AND THAT

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:17.943
CERTAINLY HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:20.145
WHY THINGS GOT SO DRY YOU KNOW

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:22.013
OUR OUR SNOW PACK IN FEBRUARY

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.448
ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT BAD IT

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:25.917
WASN'T THAT DRY MATTER OR THAT

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:28.186
LITTLE COMPARED TO. YOU KNOW

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.721
WHAT HAPPENED AND FOR EXAMPLE

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.556
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. BUT WHEN

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:33.158
THAT SNOW MELTED IT DIDN'T MAKE

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:34.793
IT INTO A RESERVOIR ST THAT WAS

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.261
PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT THE

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:38.697
SOILS WERE SO DRY. THE SNOW

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.699
MELTED INTO THE SOIL AND DIDN'T

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.667
MAKE IT INTO THE RESERVOIR SO.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.035
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.270
OF WATER RESOURCES DOES

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:47.005
FORECASTS OF HOW MUCH WATER

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.673
THERE EXPECTING WILL COME IN AND

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.675
THEY OVER ESTIMATED THAT THE RAN

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:53.845
OFF. IN THAT- SACRAMENTO BASIN

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:57.716
WAS LIKE BY 65% AND IN THE SAN

00:26:57.782 --> 00:27:00.118
JOAQUIN IN TULARE LAKE LIKE 45%

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:02.921
SO. REALLY OVER ESTIMATED. AT

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:05.056
HOW MUCH WATER WE WOULD GET FROM

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:07.592
THAT SNOW BACK- BECAUSE WE

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:09.094
DIDN'T ANTICIPATE IT WOULD SOAK

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.062
INTO THE SOIL THAT WAY SO. SO IT

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.597
GOT BAD REALLY QUICKLY AND IN

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:13.798
LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THOSE

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:16.434
TEMPERATURES- THE OTHER PART OF

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:18.169
THE STORY I THINK THAT'S WHY IT

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:21.006
GOT SO BAD SO QUICKLY IS RELATED

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:23.942
TO GROUNDWATER SO- THIS IS THE

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.910
SAME PICTURE THAT WE SAW EARLIER

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:26.845
BUT THIS IS A TEN YEAR

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.313
COMPARISON INSTEAD OF A THREE

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.914
YEAR COMPARISON SO LOOKS AT

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.983
SPRING TWENTY ELEVEN. COMPARED

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.252
TO SPRING TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.854
CAN SEE A LOT MORE RED AND

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.556
ORANGE HERE. SO THIS IS WHAT

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:40.725
THIS IS SHOWING IS THAT FROM

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:43.828
BEFORE THE LAST DROUGHT. TEN NOW

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:46.398
ON NET. WE ARE THE GROUND WATER

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:49.801
LEVELS ARE BELOW- WHAT WHAT THEY

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:52.404
WERE. SO OLD THAT THE ORANGE

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.273
BARS ARE DROPPED BY AT LEAST.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.409
FIVE FEET AND THE RED IS DROP BY

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:59.811
AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE FEET. SO

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:05.683
60% OF THESE OF THESE-

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.484
MONITORING WELLS HAVE SHOWN

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.186
DECLINE. SINCE THE LAST STRAW.

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.721
SO KIND OF WE INTO DROUGHT WITH

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:10.889
THE DEFICIT IS WHAT THIS IS

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.091
SAYING AND THEN AND HADN'T FULLY

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:15.794
RECOVERED OR- NOT TO GO BACK TO

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.128
THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND DEPEND

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.696
ON IT SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:19.564
PART OF THE STORY OF WHY THINGS

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:23.334
GOT SO BAD. SO QUICKLY IS OUR

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:23.968
GROUND WATER LEVELS WERE ALREADY

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:26.805
DEPLETED. SO NOW TIME FOR SOME

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:29.407
GOOD NEWS- IN SWITCH SWITCHING

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:30.775
TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.377
ABOUT THIS THIS IS A SUMMARY OF

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:34.079
THAT YEAH MOST RECENT BUDGET

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:36.314
PACKAGE PASSED THIS SUMMER AND

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.650
THEN INTO SEPTEMBER. THE DROUGHT

00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:39.651
AND WATER RESILIENCE BUDGET

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.786
PACKAGE AS YOU CAN SEE THREE

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.188
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:44.622
PROVIDED FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:45.824
YEAR WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE LEVEL

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.959
AS WELL AS INTENT FOR AN

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:49.094
ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED AND

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.329
EIGHTY MILLION AND ABOUT FIVE

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:52.430
HUNDRED MILLION IN THE COMING

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.199
TWO YEARS THAT STILL NEED TO BE

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.500
APPROPRIATED BUT THERE'S INTENT

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.802
TO PROVIDE THAT. FOR A VARIETY

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:03.408
OF WATER- SUCH A LAG RESILIENCE

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:04.342
DROUGHT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. THE

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.677
IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RESPONSE YOU

00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:07.178
CAN SEE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.279
SEVEN MILLION IN THE CURRENT

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.548
YEAR. PART OF THAT IS FOR THINGS

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:11.649
LIKE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:13.918
PROVIDING BOTTLED WATER OR TANKS

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.053
OF WATER TO COMMUNITIES THAT

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.188
NEED IT- BUT ALSO A NEW

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.790
COMMUNITY WATER PROGRAM THAT I

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:21.092
THINK THE SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS-

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.994
MISS MESSER FROM D. W. R. WE'LL

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:25.563
TALK ABOUT. THAT PROGRAM. A LOT

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.764
OF INVESTMENT FOR DRINKING WATER

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.233
AS YOU CAN SEE ONE POINT THREE

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:29.801
BILLION DOLLARS. I THINK THE

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.035
OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.270
HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THIS FINDING IS

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:33.605
THAT IT'S MOSTLY FROM THE

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:35.173
GENERAL FUND NEARLY ALL OF IT IS

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.341
FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:38.309
DIFFERENT. FROM WHAT THE STATE

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.410
HAS HISTORICALLY PROVIDED BOND

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:41.212
FUNDING. SO THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.380
WE'RE NOT PAYING INTEREST SO

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:44.415
IT'S- IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE FOR

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.017
THE STATE BUT ALSO OFFERS A LOT

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.619
MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW THE

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.787
FUNDS CAN BE USED BECAUSE BOND

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.523
FUNDS TYPICALLY ARE LIMITED TO.

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:53.424
CAPITAL OUTLAY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.959
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TYPE

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:56.261
PROJECTS IN HERE THERE'S A LOT

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.629
MORE FLEXIBILITY CAN BE USED FOR

00:29:57.695 --> 00:30:01.699
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT CAN BE

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.134
USED FOR- YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:06.738
KIND OF HELPING HELPING PEOPLE.

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.439
RESOLVE WHATEVER THE ISSUES ARE

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.141
RATHER THAN JUST BUILDING STUFF

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:11.609
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.278
GOOD NEWS THAT WE HAD STATE

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:14.179
SURPLUS THAT ALLOWED FOR THIS

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:15.780
TYPE. I ALSO FUNDING FOR

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.849
IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA- AND

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.651
HELPING DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:22.754
PROJECTS TO SUPPORT ABOUT THAT

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.622
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:26.758
THERE WAS ALSO SOME LEGISLATION-

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:29.060
THIS YEAR TO HELP WITH IMMEDIATE

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:30.662
DROUGHT RESPONSE I THINK I WOULD

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:33.064
CHARACTERIZE THESE AS- WAYS TO

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.632
EXPEDITE PROJECTS IN SPEED UP

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:38.269
PROCESS SEES. SO NORMALLY WHEN

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.637
WE'RE ALLOCATING STATE FUNDS

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.406
IT'S OFTEN THREE- COMPETITIVE

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.907
GRANT PROJECTS OUR CURRENT

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:44.776
CREDIT COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:46.611
SEES AND SEVERAL LOCAL AGENCIES

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.712
NEED TO PUT TOGETHER GRANT

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.214
APPLICATIONS AND MAYBE COME UP

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.381
WITH MATCHING FUNDS AND IT'S A

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:52.617
MUCH LONGER PROCESS SO. THIS

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.085
LEGISLATION ALLOWS THE STATE TO

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:56.321
PROVIDE DIRECT EXPENDITURES IF

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.855
THE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:58.456
DON'T NEED TO PUT TOGETHER A

00:30:58.523 --> 00:30:59.791
GRANT APPLICATION YOU DON'T NEED

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:01.192
TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST OTHERS THE

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:02.393
STATE WILL COME IN AND HELP FIX

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.797
THAT SO. AGAIN THAT'S EXPEDITING

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:06.864
FOR MORE OF THAT EMERGENCY

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:09.300
CONDITIONS AND THEN SIMILARLY

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:10.802
IT'S OFTEN USUALLY STATE

00:31:10.868 --> 00:31:12.203
PROGRAMS ARE SET UP ON A

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.138
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. WHICH CAN

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.607
BE HARD FOR ESPECIALLY SMALL

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:16.874
LOCAL AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:18.843
ALL THE UP FRONT CASH TO

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.278
UNDERTAKE A PROJECT AND WAIT FOR

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.513
STATE REIMBURSEMENT SO- THIS

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.915
LEGISLATION ALLOWED FOR THE

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:26.084
EMERGENCY DROUGHT PROJECTS THAT-

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.886
UP 225% OF IT CAN. JUST BE

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:33.524
FRONTED MEDIA. LEE WITHOUT

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:34.158
HAVING TO WAIT FOR REIMBURSEMENT

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:35.026
. SO WITH THAT I'M A JEALOUS OF

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.561
HIS MASTER THAT SHE GETS TO DO

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.630
THE REALLY GOOD NEWS OF.

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:39.931
UPDATING ON CURRENT CONDITIONS

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:43.001
BUT- I GUESS. I GUESS TALK ABOUT

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.235
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR WATER SO

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:46.004
THAT SOME GOOD. WITH THAT I'M

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.505
HAPPY TO AND ANSWER ANY

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:50.041
QUESTIONS AND- THANKS FOR THE

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:52.810
OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.612
FOR THAT AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:57.081
OUR NEXT. PANELIST FOR THE

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:59.183
SECTION AND THAT'S- CINDY

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.518
MASTERED THE LEAD DEPUTY

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:01.919
DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:05.056
WATER RESOURCES. WELCOME THANK

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:07.358
YOU VERY MUCH AND AS MY FELLOW

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:09.093
PANELISTS SAID I'M GONNA TRY AND

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.863
SHARE MY SCREEN AND THAT IS THE

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:14.866
SCARIEST PART SO. LET ME SEE I

00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:24.742
SEE IT HERE. JUST. ALL RIGHT

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:26.844
WELL I'M GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.713
CHAIR AND SENATOR MELINDA BUSH

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.315
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:32.116
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF A

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:34.218
PANEL OF THIS AFTERNOON AND TO

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.620
TALK WITH YOU ABOUT CURRENT

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:37.955
WATER CONDITIONS AND RELATED

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:38.856
DROUGHT CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.326
THE STATE- I DID WANT TO

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:42.760
ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRAPHIC THAT WAS

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.395
PROVIDED IN THE BACKGROUND

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.230
DOCUMENT BUT I ALSO THINK MOST

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.299
ELDERS ALSO CONFIDED THAT IN HER

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.568
PRESENTATION THAT'S THE GRAPHIC

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.603
THAT SHOWS DROUGHT SEVERITY

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.073
THROUGH THE ENTIRE STATE OF THAT

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.641
PARTICULAR ILLUSTRATION REALLY

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:58.443
JUMPED OUT FOR ME BECAUSE I

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:59.944
THINK WHAT IT SO EFFECTIVELY

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.046
SHOWS IS. THE FACT THAT THERE IS

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.415
NO WHERE SHE'S CURRENTLY IN OUR

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:05.850
STATE THAT IS UNTOUCHED BY

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.719
DROUGHT THE DEGREES OF SEVERITY

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:09.654
MAY BE DIFFERENT BUT EVERY

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:13.257
PORTION OF THE STATE IS

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:13.891
DEFINITELY AFFECTED IN SOME WAY

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.094
. SO WHAT I WANTED TO PRESENT ON

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.595
THIS AFTERNOON OR A COUPLE

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.964
DIFFERENT AREAS- I WANT TO TOUCH

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.899
A LITTLE BIT ON HYDROLOGIC AND

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.568
WATER SUPPLY CONDITIONS AS THEY

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.470
CURRENTLY STAND. AND I THINK I

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:27.305
WILL PROBABLY DUPLICATE A LITTLE

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:29.040
BIT- WITH MY FELLOW PANELISTS

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:30.508
BUT I WON'T DWELL ON ON SOME OF

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:32.510
THOSE POINTS- JUST. WANNA MAKE

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.411
SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:35.146
IMPORTANT. ITEMS THAT ARE

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.415
PROBABLY WORTH REPEATING AS I GO

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:40.017
THROUGH MY CREATION TATIAN- I DO

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.786
WANT TO FOCUS ON THE STATE'S

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.388
APPROACH- SPECIFICALLY

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.490
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AS

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:47.091
WE MANAGE. THE STATE WATER

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:49.394
PROJECT. OF OUR APPROACH TO

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.396
MANAGING CURRENT WATER SUPPLIES

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.164
AS WE MOVE INTO THIS NEW WATER

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.933
YEAR. STARTED ON OCTOBER FIRST

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.635
SO WE'RE NOT TERRIBLY FAR INTO

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.771
THE WATER YOU'RE JUST YET- AND

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:02.206
WE ARE ENTERING WHAT I KNOW WE

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.241
ALL HOPE WILL BE THE WEIRDEST

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:05.543
PART. PORTION SORRY OF THE WATER

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.478
HERE SO STARTING WITH THIS MONTH

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.114
OF DECEMBER AND MOVING INTO.

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.449
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THAT IS

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:12.817
TRADITIONALLY THE WETTEST

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:17.622
PORTION OF OUR WATER HERE. AND

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:18.256
SO I KNOW WE ARE ALL. ROSS THIS

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.858
WEEK HAS. A GREAT AT HOME FOR

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.460
GETTING SOME PRECIPITATION MUCH

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.662
NEEDED SNOW- BUT WE ARE WE DO

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.564
STILL HAVE MONTHS AHEAD OF US

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:28.266
THAT BRING. HIGH DEGREE OF

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:30.301
UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER THIS

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:31.836
TYPE OF WEATHER WILL PERSIST

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.805
THROUGH WALMART- SO WE'LL TALK A

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:35.306
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HOW WE

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:37.542
ENTERED THIS WATER YEAR IN OUR

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.410
APPROACH TO. MANAGING SUPPLIES.

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.345
AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED TO JUST

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.114
HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL EFFORTS.

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:45.082
ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES FOR THE

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:47.051
STATE IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING.

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:48.586
AND THESE ARE MEANT TO ASSIST

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.721
COMMUNITIES LOCAL WATER

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.623
SUPPLIERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.926
ARE ROUGHLY THESE ACTIVITIES

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.661
FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.529
PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DATA.

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.932
PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.700
AND PROVIDING COMMUNICATION AND

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.403
COORDINATION SERVICE ARM AND

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.538
JUST BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF FUN

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.407
RITUALS. SOME OF THE INFORMATION

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.442
SHE PROVIDED. THESE INITIATIVES

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:15.480
AND EFFORTS. FALL INTO BOTH- A

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:16.581
PREVIOUS THE PREVIOUS

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:19.183
IMPLEMENTED. AND THOSE ACTIONS

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.486
THAT COME OUT OF THE LAST ROUTE

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:23.321
BUT WE'RE ALSO IN AND THAT IS

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:25.056
KIND OF A POSITIVE PART OF MY

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:27.058
PRESENTATION WERE ALSO-

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.693
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING.

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:30.261
ACTIVITIES THAT CAME OUT OF THE

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.196
RECENTLY PASSED STATE BUDGET-

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:35.132
SO- JUST KIND OF TOUCH UPON BOTH

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:39.070
OF THOSE TYPE OF AREA. HOME WHEN

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.873
WE MOVED INTO WATER CONDITIONS

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:44.075
SO- FOR CONTEXT AND AGAIN TO

00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:45.743
MAYBE ECHO WHAT MY TROUBLE

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.913
PANELIST KEYED UP- WE ARE WE

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.448
HAVE STARTED THIS WATER YEAR

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.283
WITH HISTORIC LOW LEVELS OF

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.219
WATER STORED IN OUR RESERVOIRS

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.255
BUT ALSO OUR GROUNDWATER AND

00:35:57.321 --> 00:36:00.525
BOXERS AND THIS IS IN LARGE PART

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:01.926
TO COMING OFF OF A TWO YEAR

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:03.394
PERIODS WILL LAST YOU

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:06.030
CONSECUTIVE YEARS COMBINED WHERE

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:08.766
THE SECOND DRIEST IN OVER A

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:11.402
HUNDRED YEARS SO WE HAVE ENTERED

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.170
THIS WATER YEAR WITH THE

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.873
DEFICIT- AND A LOT OF

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.975
UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT LIES

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:20.211
AHEAD. SO BASED ON THAT WE ARE

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:21.879
APPROACHING THE YEAR AND

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.681
MANAGING CURRENT OUR SUPPLIES IN

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:25.283
A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER AND

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.384
I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:33.524
ABOUT THATJUST A SECOND- AS I

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:34.158
MENTIONED WE ARE. CAN OF

00:36:34.225 --> 00:36:35.259
ENTERING THE CAP KELAPA WEATHER

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:37.261
MONTHS- SO WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:40.965
AND FEBRUARY. THANKS FOR THE

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.733
REST OF THE WATER HERE AND HOW

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.603
WE MANAGE SUPPLIES MOVING

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.604
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORLD

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.973
TWENTY TWO. SO CURRENT

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.374
CONDITIONS THAT WAS STRAIGHT THE

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:52.343
VERY ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.844
WATER CONDITIONS AT A LOCAL

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:56.080
LEVEL- AND THE GRAPHIC THAT I'M

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.382
SHOWING RIGHT NOW OUR THE SLIDE

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.051
THAT I'M SHOWING IS MEANT TO

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:02.153
ILLUSTRATE THAT VERY ABILITY. SO

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.621
ESSENTIALLY WHERE WE STAND RIGHT

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.156
NOW- IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF

00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:06.924
CALIFORNIA IS THAT IN THE

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.994
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE OVER

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:12.096
THE LAST ROUGHLY TWO MONTHS. AND

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:13.664
IN TERMS OF PERCENT OF AVERAGE

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:16.100
PRECIPITATION WE ARE DOING WELL

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.903
WE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND 50% OF

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.905
AVERAGE AGAIN THIS IS KIND OF A

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:23.240
SNAPSHOT IN TIME. IN TERMS OF

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:25.309
AVERAGE PRECIPITATION. BUT AS

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:27.511
YOU MOVE FURTHER SOUTH- DOWN THE

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:29.313
STATE WILL GET THE CENTRAL

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.948
PORTION OF THE STATE. THEY'RE AT

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:33.250
A LOWER AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:35.586
PRECIPITATION AND YOU MOVE INTO

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:36.821
THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:39.190
STATE. SOME OF THOSE WATERSHEDS

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:42.226
OR ONLY AT ABOUT 4250% OF

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.195
AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:46.864
SO VERY ABILITY VERY KEY TO THE

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.933
TO THE STAGE AND THEN AGAIN THE

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.770
UNCERTAINTY OF THE CONDITIONS

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:56.273
THAT LIE AHEAD OF US- SORRY. ALL

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.942
BACK P FOR JUST A SECOND HERE-

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.910
I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT WE

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.812
ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELCOMING OF

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.848
THIS WEEK'S STORMS ARE MUCH

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:05.483
NEEDED SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.318
MUCH NEEDED PRECIPITATION IN

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.886
PARTS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:10.521
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WHAT

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.356
WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL THAT THE

00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:14.158
STORMS ARE BY NO MEANS A DROUGHT

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:17.094
BUSTER WE WILL NEED MANY MORE OF

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.629
THESE TYPES OF STORMS EVENTS

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:19.764
THROUGH THE SEASON TO REALLY

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.733
MOVE US PAST DIRE CONDITIONS

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.902
THAT WE TRIED- OURSELVES AND-

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.470
HAVE FOUND OURSELVES AND AS WE

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:29.306
ENTER THE LAST. LAST PART OF

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.876
THIS YEAR. OUR FORECASTS AND WE

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:33.511
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE-

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:34.945
ABOUT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:37.148
PRESENTATION ON THIS YEAR'S

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.816
WEATHER FORECASTS. DO YOU

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.284
SUGGEST TO THE NORTHERN PART OF

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.386
THE STATE. COULD RECEIVE ABOVE

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.655
AVERAGE PRECIPITATION FOR THE

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.691
MONTH OF DECEMBER. BUT THEY'RE

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.092
ALSO SHOWING THE POTENTIAL THAT

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.027
THIS PRECIPITATION DROPS OFF

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.196
OVER THE REST OF THAT SEASON SO

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:53.264
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.566
MONITORING VERY CLOSELY. AND

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:57.435
OBVIOUSLY WILL BE FACTORING INTO

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.236
OUR DECISIONS AROUND WATER

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:01.105
ALLOCATION WATER STORAGE

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.475
PRESERVATION AS WE MOVE INTO THE

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.911
SPRING MONTHS. SEVERAL SWITCHING

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:09.346
GEARS I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:12.383
UPON VERY BRIEFLY WATER STORAGE

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.119
I THINK THIS IS- AN ILLUSTRATION

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.254
THAT IS SIMILAR AND IN SOME WAYS

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.856
TO THE GRAPHIC THAT. RACHEL

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:21.692
SHOWED EARLIER- WHAT THIS

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.427
ILLUSTRATION IS MEANT TO SHOW

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:25.262
YOU IS THAT LOOKING AT ALL OF

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:26.831
THE MAJOR WATER STORAGE

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:29.133
RESERVOIRS WITHIN THE STATE WHAT

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.235
YOU QUICKLY NOTICE IS THAT THE

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:33.370
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WELL BELOW

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:35.873
AVERAGE- WELL BELOW AVERAGE

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.875
HISTORICAL ALL CAPACITY. IN

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.376
THEIR CURRENT CAPACITIES ARE

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:42.446
VERY LOW OF THE TWO THAT I WOULD

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:43.948
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO JUST

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.549
BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL TO THE

00:39:45.616 --> 00:39:48.119
STATE WATER PROJECT. OR LAKE OR

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:50.588
A BILL WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:51.856
THE CRAFT IN THE UPPER RIGHT

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:54.125
HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE YOU'LL

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.460
SEE AS OF DECEMBER FOURTEENTH SO

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:58.395
JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO. MAKE

00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:02.800
YOUR BILL WAS ABOUT. 31% OF ITS

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.268
CAPACITY. AND OTHER. AND DRAW

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:06.137
YOUR TO THE SAINT LOUIS

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.305
RESERVOIR MIDDLE OF THE STATE

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.074
THE CHART IS ON THE LEFT HAND

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.343
SIDE. AND AS OF A COUPLE DAYS

00:40:12.409 --> 00:40:15.513
AGO THAT RESERVOIRS ABOUT 24% OF

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:18.649
CAPACITY SO. SO AS I THINK WE

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.751
BOTH HAVE A CODE- EACH OTHER WE

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.119
HAVE STARTED THIS YEAR WAS A

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:24.121
GREAT DEFICIT IN TERMS OF THE

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.423
WATER WE HAVE AVAILABLE. I WOULD

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.392
NOTE THAT THE COVER SLIDE TO MY

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.994
PRESENTATION IS SAM WAS

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.962
RESERVOIR I THINK A PICTURE IS

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.464
WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS AND JUST

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:35.366
LOOKING AT THAT YOU CAN. SEE

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:40.137
THAT INDEED 24% MAKES SENSE WHEN

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.672
YOU LOOK AT THE WATER LEVELS.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.975
ALONG SURE. I WOULD ALSO JUST

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.811
KNOWN SUMMARY THAT STATEWIDE

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.579
RESERVOIR STORAGE AT THE END OF

00:40:48.646 --> 00:40:50.514
NOVEMBER SO JUST LAST MONTH

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:53.851
WHAT'S THAT 66% OF AVERAGE. AND

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:56.320
THAT'S IN COMPARISON 287% OF

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.355
AVERAGE FOR THIS SAME TIME LAST

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:00.491
YEAR SO AGAIN THE TREND HAS BEEN

00:41:00.558 --> 00:41:04.562
DOWNWARD AGAIN WE HAVE STARTED

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.297
THIS YEAR WITH MUCH LESS WATER.

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.532
AND I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH AT

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.367
THIS POINT ON GROUNDWATER LEVELS

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.236
I THINK WE HAVE MENTIONED THAT

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.537
THIS WAS ALSO ANOTHER PART OF

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.506
THE EQUATION COMING INTO THIS

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:17.341
WATER YEAR. OVER THE LAST BULLET

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.243
PAST SUMMER WE DID OBSERVE

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.945
DRAMATIC DROPS IN GROUNDWATER

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:22.847
LEVELS ESPECIALLY IN PARTS OF

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.782
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND THIS

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:27.284
REFLECTS INCREASES IN PUMPING AS

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:29.353
WATER USERS IN THESE AREAS A

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.388
LITTLE OR NO SURFACE WATER

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.557
ALLOCATIONS LAST YEAR. SO FOR

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:35.226
THE STATE WATER PROJECT OVER

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:37.328
THIS LAST YEAR OR ALLOCATIONS

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:39.763
WILL ROLL AROUND FIVE PERCENT.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.999
SIR WATER USERS NEEDED TO TURN

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:44.735
TO OTHER SOURCES- COUPLE MET IN

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:49.240
AND TO ADDRESS THE WATER DEMANDS

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:54.144
THAT THEY HAD. SO. SORRY I'M

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.546
GONNA BACK UP JUST A MINUTE HERE

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.047
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:59.183
ABOUT MANAGING WATER SUPPLY SO

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.718
AGAIN THIS IS FROM THE STATE

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:03.854
WATER PERSPECTIVE. AS WE BEGIN A

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.222
WET SEASON AS WE SAID WITH

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:06.824
EXTREMELY CHALLENGING WATER

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.926
SUPPLY CONDITIONS STATE WATER

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:11.595
PROJECT INITIALLY WILL REALLY

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:14.231
ONLY PLANNING TO DELIVER MINIMUM

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.367
RESIDENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:18.569
WATER NEEDS SO I'M SURE MANY OF

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.537
YOU SAW IN THE MEDIA ON DECEMBER

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:22.306
FIRST WE DID OUR INITIAL STATE

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:24.308
WATER PROJECT ALLOCATION AND

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.278
THAT WHAT OUR ALLOCATION WAS 0%

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:29.413
WE ARE STILL PROVIDING WATER TO

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.614
SOME OF OUR STATE WATER

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:33.117
CONTRACTORS FOR HUMAN HEALTH

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.585
HOME GYM AND HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:37.655
NEEDS. BUT THE ALLOCATION IN THE

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.124
TRADITIONAL SENSE IS THE LOWEST

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.694
WE HAVE NOT HAD A 0% ALLOCATION.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.230
BERRY BEGINNING IN NINETEEN

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.065
NINETY SO IT IS- AND DID A VERY

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:49.967
HISTORICAL MOMENT FOR OUR

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:56.740
PROCESS- AS WE- BEING INTO

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.342
FURTHER INTO THE WET SEASON WE

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.710
ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:02.212
WATER AGENCIES TO CONTINUE TO

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:04.515
IDENTIFY HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:05.816
THAT THEY MAY HAVE IN THEIR

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:09.153
SERVICE AREAS CURRENTLY WE HAVE

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:09.853
EIGHT OF OUR STATE WATER

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.322
CONTRACTORS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:14.124
WORKING WITH SHOE PROVIDE. US

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.160
SOME WATER FOR THOSE TYPES OF

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:19.396
NEEDS- TO HELP THEM MEET THOSE

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:22.099
COMMITMENTS AND DELIVER WATER

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.434
FOR AGAIN HUMAN HEALTH AND

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.369
SAFETY NEEDS SERVICES DOMESTIC

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:29.239
USE USE FOR SANITATION AND FIRE

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:29.940
SUPPRESSION. WE ARE ALSO

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:32.042
COORDINATING WITH U. S. BUREAU

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.044
OF RECLAMATION WHO IS IN CHARGE

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:36.213
OF OPERATING THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.615
PROJECT. H. YOU ARE WORKING WITH

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.184
THEIR MUNICIPAL WATER

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.986
CONTRACTORS IN THEIR SERVICE

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:45.122
AREAS TO IDENTIFY SIMILAR.

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:47.858
CRITICAL RESIDENTIAL. AND HEALTH

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.327
INSURANCE SAFETY NEEDS TOGETHER

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.496
WERE ARE LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:54.465
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:55.399
WORKING WITH OUR WATER

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.801
CONTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY WHO'S

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:00.204
MOST AT NEED AT THIS POINT IN

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.339
TIME IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.808
. SO AS WE LOOK AT- AT OPERATING

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.577
THE STATE WATER PROJECT AS I

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.178
MENTIONED WERE WERE ERRING ON

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:08.679
THE SIDE OF BEING VERY

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.015
CONSERVATIVE THIS EARLY IN THE

00:44:11.081 --> 00:44:12.383
WATER YEAR BASED ON STARTING

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:14.051
WITH SUCH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.353
WATER IN STORAGE. THERE ARE

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.022
CERTAIN CRITICAL AREAS THAT WE

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:19.490
ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:21.625
ADMISSIONS. HUMAN HEALTH AND

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:24.261
SAFETY NEEDS ONE THING I WOULD

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.196
HAVE A LINK TO THIS JUST MAYBE

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:27.931
FOR SOME CONTEXT TO SOME OF THE

00:44:27.998 --> 00:44:29.433
INFORMATION AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.235
BE SEEN THROUGH THE MEDIA-

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.469
READING OR HEARING ABOUT NO

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:36.640
OTHER PLACES. IS THAT PART OF-

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:40.477
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE WATER AND

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:41.812
WATER QUALITY THAT IS SAFE FOR

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:44.381
DRINKING WATER AND DOMESTIC USE-

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.183
WE NEED TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.318
IN THE DELTA REGION. SO ONE OF

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.586
THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE IN

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.522
THE PAST AND THAT WE DID AGAIN

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:56.427
FOR THIS DROUGHT IS TO INSTALL.

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:57.561
A ROCKET TEMPORARY WALK. DELTA

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:01.565
BUT IT'S- IS USED REPEL- SALT

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.333
WATER WORKS SALTIER WATER COMING

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.601
IN FROM THE OCEAN AND THE BABY

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.503
INTO THE DELTA. AND PRESERVING

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.505
THE FRESH WATER THAT IS FLOWING.

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:10.474
THROUGH THE DELTA REGION SO

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.509
THAT'S OUR TEMPORARY BARRIER IT

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:14.244
IS STAYING IN PLACE FOR THE

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.513
MOMENT. BUT WE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.382
EVALUATING THE NEED FOR THAT

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.517
YOUR POTENTIALLY OTHER BARRIERS

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:24.388
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE HYDROLOGY

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:24.955
GETS US AS WE MOVE INTO THE

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.924
SPRING. ANOTHER CATEGORY OF

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.859
CRITICAL NEED THAT WE ARE REALLY

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.527
FOCUSED ON IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:31.495
APPROACHING WHAT WATER

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.630
MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS OF STATE

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.699
WATER PROJECT. IS WATER NEEDED

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.634
FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES OUR I

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:40.938
KNOW THAT RACHEL TALKED ABOUT-

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:43.240
THAT NEED FOR FISHERIES- WE'VE

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.676
ALSO BEEN HELPING IN DIFFERENT

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.644
WAYS WITH SOME OF THE CITRIX Y.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:50.948
WAY. EFFORTS TO PRESERVE

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:53.050
NATIONAL WET AREAS FOR BIRDS

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:53.817
THAT ARE MIGRATING THROUGH THE

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.786
STATE. SO THAT'S ANOTHER

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:57.354
CRITICAL AREA THAT WE'RE REALLY

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:00.924
FOCUSED ON AS WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:03.193
WATER OPERATIONS. OVERALL OUR-

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.394
ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS IS TO

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:06.630
PRESERVE STORAGE IN OUR IN THE

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.465
RESERVOIRS ARE KEY RESERVOIRS

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:10.400
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.903
SHE WILL BRING. AND SO YOU KNOW

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.071
LOOKING AT THE GRAPHIC I HAVE UP

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.406
NOW AND AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THE

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:16.974
FACT THAT WE'RE STARTING AT

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.076
LOWER LEVELS. REALLY TRYING TO

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.811
PRESERVE THOSE TO GET US THROUGH

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:23.313
THE YEAR- AND HOPING THAT WE

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.815
CONTINUE TO HAVE STORMS LIKE WE

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:26.683
DO THIS WEEK HOME I THINK REALLY

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.318
MAYBE GOING BACK TO THE OCTOBER

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.653
THE BIG ATMOSPHERIC RIVER AND

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.588
THEY CAME THROUGH THE STATE. ONE

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.023
OF THE THINGS THAT THAT DID THAT

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.558
WILL BE HELPFUL AS WE MOVE

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:37.327
FORWARD IS TO. TUNE HIDE-

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.662
ADDITIONAL MOISTURE INTO THE

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:40.030
SOIL SO TO BUILD THE SOIL

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:42.266
MOISTURE CONTENT. SO WE DON'T

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:44.368
HAVE THAT THAT SORT OF REALLY

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:46.537
FAST AND FURIOUS AND BAD EVENT

00:46:46.603 --> 00:46:48.338
THAT WE HAD YOU KNOW THIS LAST

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:49.406
YEAR WHERE THE SOILS WERE BONE

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.675
DRY DRY AND THE WATER THAT WE

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.110
GOT WAS JUST IMMEDIATELY SUCKED

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:54.845
UP INTO ONE SO THAT. HELPS PUT

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.214
US ON A LITTLE BETTER FOOTING-

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.283
BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.651
MANAGING TO SHOOT THESE LOW

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:03.687
LEVELS. AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.454
TO MENTION THAT I THINK I

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.223
PROBABLY SAID IT A COUPLE

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.825
DIFFERENT WAYS- IS THAT WHAT

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:10.661
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HYDROLOGY

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.396
WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:14.198
CLIMATE INDUCED IMPACTS LIKE

00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:15.899
WARMER TEMPERATURES. ANOTHER

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:18.268
ISSUE THAT REALLY EXASPERATED

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:20.504
THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THIS LAST

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:22.206
YEAR SO WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:23.307
KNOW OUR TEMPERATURES AIR

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:24.841
TEMPERATURES LOOKING NORMAL

QUOTE UNQUOTE FOR THIS MONTH FOR

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:34.051
JANUARY. FOR FEBRUARY- AND KIND

HAVE WE'RE NOT COMING IN. EACH

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:39.423
THE RESERVOIRS ARE WE SEE THE

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:40.891
TREND MAY BE MOVING UP IN TERMS

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:43.327
OF STORAGE WE WILL BE ADJUSTING

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:45.729
ALLOCATION. OF WATER TO OUR

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:48.332
CONTRACTORS- HOPING THAT YOU

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:50.500
KNOW WE CANNOT SUPPLY WATER FOR

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.736
PURPOSES. IN ADDITION TO JUST

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:54.338
THAT YOU WILL HELP HUMAN HEALTH

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:57.140
AND SAFETY MEETINGS- BUT IT WILL

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.042
BE A VERY DYNAMIC PROCESS AND

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:00.944
AGAIN WE WILL HAVE TO ADJUST YOU

FIVE SLIDES ARE GOING TO MAKE A

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:19.763
LAST I GUESS- BUT JUST AS I

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.564
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:22.172
RECALL IT'S MEANT TO REALLY-

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:23.840
IT'S TARGETED AT RESIDENTIAL

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.408
WATER USERS SO IT'S MENTOR

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:28.545
PROVIDES REALLY SIMPLE WAYS THAT

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.947
RESIDENTIAL RESIDENTS CAN.

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.582
REDUCE THEIR WATER USE WITHIN

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.984
OUR HOUSE AROUND THE HOUSE WAYS

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:36.853
TO KINDERGARTEN GOING- BUT WITH

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.656
LESS WATER. SO WE HAVEN'T DONE A

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:42.358
LOT OF ADVERTISEMENTS TODAY WE

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:44.561
WILL CONTINUE TO UTILIZE A LOT

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.362
OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO GET

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.398
MESSAGING OUT WE ARE DOING THIS

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:49.933
IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WE ARE

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.334
TARGETING DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.369
MARKETS I'M IN COMMUNITIES

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:54.971
RECOGNIZING THAT PRIORITIES

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.739
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT INFORMATION

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.241
NEEDS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT. SO

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.843
WILL BE MORE TO COME ON THAT AS

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.477
WE MOVE INTO THE NEW YEAR BUT

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.012
THAT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.214
AREAS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.649
SURE- IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.251
THAT THE STATE IS APPROACHING

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:14.390
AGAIN. A STATEWIDE. USING THIS

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:14.991
TOOL TO ACHIEVE THAT. SO THINK

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:19.095
THAT I AM- MY PRESENT AND HAPPY

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.563

AT THIS MOMENT I WILL OPEN UP-

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.141
THIS PART OF THE OF THE

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:34.410
COMMITTEE PROVIDE FOR QUESTIONS

00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:35.945
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SO

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.046
WHEN IT JUST AFRAID OF

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:39.349
SUNDERLAND SEARCHES QUESTIONS

INFORMATION THERE SAID BREADTH

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:48.825
OF INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARED

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:50.627
SOME OF WHICH YOU KNOW WE ARE

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.962
ALL AWARE OF- BUT A LITTLE MORE

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.231
DETAIL- ON THOSE WHICH I

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:57.567
APPRECIATE BUT WE TALK A LOT.

00:58:57.634 --> 00:59:02.338
ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF. NOT

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:04.040
HAVING ENOUGH WATER BUT I WONDER

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:05.575
IF SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THIS VERY

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:07.911
SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH IS. WHAT

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:11.147
WOULD THE COST BE. IF WE WERE

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:18.121
TO- BUILD THE. RESERVOIRS IN AND

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.088
EVERYTHING WE WOULD NEED TO

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.590
CONSERVE MORE WATER FOR

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:21.324
CALIFORNIANS WHAT WOULD THAT

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.693
COST BE IF WE WERE TO DO THAT SO

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.728
THAT WHEN WE WERE IN THE SEVERE

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:28.231
DROUGHT YEARS. CALIFORNIANS

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.233
WOULD BE ENSURED THAT THEY WOULD

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.734
HAVE THE WATER THAT THEY NEED

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:34.203
CAN ANYONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:40.376
FOR ME BY ANY CHANCE. THIS IS

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.912
RACHEL EVANS WITH THE LA OUT- I

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.280
THINK THE INFORMATION AND I

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.748
DON'T HAVE IT ON HAND BUT I'M

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.984
HAPPY TO SEND IT THAT THAT WE

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:50.386
HAVE IS ESTIMATED COSTS OF THE

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:53.156
PROPOSED. KIND OF RESERVOIRS

00:59:53.222 --> 00:59:57.060
AND- AND GROUNDWATER PROPOSALS

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.227
FOR THE PROPOSITION ONE WATER

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.363
STORAGE FUNDING. SO WE HAVE COST

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.799
ESTIMATES FOR THAT IN TERMS OF

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.435
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO KIND

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.602
OF ADDRESS ALL CALIFORNIA'S

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.371
WATER NEEDS AND THAT IS NOT A

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.706
NUMBER I'VE SEEN IT NOW OR AN

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:12.642
ESTIMATE THAT I'VE SEEN- BUT WE

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.444
CERTAINLY DO HAVE ESTIMATES FOR.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.679
PROPOSED THAT TOTAL COST OF SOME

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.181
OF THAT PROPOSED WATER STORAGE

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.249
PROJECTS OF THAT- AND THEN THAT

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:21.985
WOULD BE IN THAT KIND OF-

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:25.121
MULTIPLE BILLION DOLLAR. RANGE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.889
BUT HAPPY HAPPY I THINK YOU KNOW

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.091
I WANT TO SAY FOURTEEN BILLION

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:30.059
DOLLARS OF OFF THE TOP OF MY

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.828
HEAD FOR THOSE PROP ONE THE

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:33.029
TOTAL COST OF THOSE PROPOSED

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.998
PROP ONE STORAGE PROJECTS BEAT

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.333
THEIR EIGHT OF THEM- BUT HAPPY

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:37.934
TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.869
WITH MORE SPECIFIC THAT THAT'S-

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.371
KIND OF THE- THE BEST ESTIMATE I

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:46.809
HAVE I DON'T KNOW IF MISS MESSER. HAS HAS MORE TO OFFER. I'M NOW

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:47.643
MUCH MORE IN I WOULD I THINK

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.345
THOSE ARE PROBABLY OUR BEST AND

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.913
GIVE THEY GIVE US THE BEST IDEA

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.048
OF WHAT THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.951
COST AND- YOU KNOW THEY- WERE

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.719
LIMITED. IN THE AREAS IN WHICH

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.855
WE CAN INSTALL THESE KIND OF

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:00.556
PROJECTS SO THERE'S ALSO THAT

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.291
THE IDEA THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:05.595
MIGHT BE IT. THE LEASE FOR NOW

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:06.362
ON SORT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.931
SIDE. I WOULD ALSO SAY TO

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.733
THERE'S THERE STORAGE THERE'S

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.235
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THERE'S

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.270
ALSO A LOT. TO BE GAINED ON THE

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.772
CONSERVATION SIDE AND I KNOW

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.040
THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE HARDER

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.107
TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON BUT I

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.810
THINK THAT'S- PART OF THE SUPER

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.780
WATER CAMPAIGN- WE HAVE VARIOUS

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.883
WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS- THAT.

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:28.518
YOU KNOW WE LOOK TO THE LOCAL

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.286
WATER SUPPLIERS TO IMPLEMENT

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.155
WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES. I

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.557
KNOW THE GOVERNOR BROWN HAD THE

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.559
25% REDUCTION GOVERNOR NEWSOM IS

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.661
ASKING FOR FIFTEEN PERCENT.

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.296
ABOVE THOSE LEVELS BUT I THINK

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.398
THERE ARE AREAS IN THE HOLE IN

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:43.399
MY MIND THE WHOLE THING IS AN

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.002
EQUATION SO YOU'VE GOT SUPPLY.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.336
WE'VE GOT SOME DEMAND BUT

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.638
SOMEWHERE IN THERE THERE ARE

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.506
DIFFERENT MEASURES YOU CAN TAKE

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.575
TO REALLY KIND OF. IF YOU WILL.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:57.246
IT. INCREASED WATER THAT WE HAVE

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.781
. AT OUR DISPOSAL SO I'M TO

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.450
FOLLOW UP ON SURE SOME OF OUR

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.851
FOLKS WILL HAVE TO MEDICINAL

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.020
PERMISSION YOU CAN PACKAGE FOR.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.222
HOURS AND PERMISSION. THANK YOU

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:07.457
LADIES I APPRECIATE THAT IN THE

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:08.858
END IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:12.462
CLEARLY- I JUST YOU KNOW I'M

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.931
LEFT TO WONDER. IF WE WOULD JUST

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.899
INVEST THE MONEY PARTICULARLY IN

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.468
YEARS LIKE THIS YEAR AND LAST

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.470
YEAR WHERE WE HAD- A BUDGET

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.638
SURPLUS AND IF WE COULD PERHAPS

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.674
INVEST THAT MONEY IN. SOME OF

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.609
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT YOU

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:27.310
KNOW IT WE WOULD HAVE IT IN

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.445
PLACE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. THE

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.179
LONGER YOU WAIT THE MORE

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.315
EXPENSIVE IT. BECOMES TO DO

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.317
PROJECTS LIKE THIS AND IT'S A

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:36.219
BIG TICKET ITEM FOR SURE AND I

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.454
THINK. YOU KNOW.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.022
ADMINISTRATION'S OFTENTIMES ARE

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.859
HSITANT TO. KIND OF SPEND

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:45.094
EVERYTHING IN THE ACCOUNT BUT- I

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.162
THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:47.730
THAT WE COULD BE DOING THAT

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:50.867
WE'VE THAT WE'VE NOT YET DONE-

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.535
EVEN GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST OF

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.570
OUR WATER USE IS NOT FROM

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.239
RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS BUT REALLY

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.307
FROM THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:01.577
HOWEVER WE- FEED THE COUNTRY YOU

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.979
KNOW WITH OUR FRUITS AND

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.114
VEGETABLES AND I THINK IT'S-

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.949
WHAT TWO THIRDS. COMES FROM

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.118
CALIFORNIA SO. WE CERTAINLY HAVE

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:10.419
A VESTED INTEREST NOT ONLY IN

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.054
THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS BUT

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.456
IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHO

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.291
DEPEND ON US. AND I THINK WE

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.594
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO. INVEST IN

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.062
THE THINGS WE NEED TO INVEST IN

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:21.931
TO MAKE SURE THAT. NOT ONLY A

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.733
RESIDENTIAL USERS HAVE THE WATER

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:24.333
THAT THEY NEED BETTER

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.102
AGRICULTURAL USERS TO BECAUSE

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:26.936
THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:29.672
CAN. YOU KNOW FOR SURE I MEAN

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.474
THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT OF

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.276
INNOVATION OUT THERE THERE'S-

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.678
CERTAINLY- SOME INNOVATION THAT

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.513
HAS COME FROM THE PAST AND

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.215
CONTINUES TO COME FROM ISRAEL

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.283
WITH RESPECT TO WATER

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.118
CONSERVATION MAKING BETTER USE

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:44.687
OF THE SUPPLY THAT WE HAVE BUT I

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.323
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT. WE CAN DO

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:52.128
MORE WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE IT-

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.596
FOR A FOR A NUMBER O REASONS

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:57.300
BYE I THINK THE- THE CHAIRWOMAN

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.802
PROBABLY M. SHARES. SOME OF THAT

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:04.307
STUFF OPINION I WOULD IMAGINE-

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.641
PARTICULARLY FROM THE AREA THAT

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:06.943
SHE LIVES AND I KNOW MY SON

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.544
WHO'S IN THE NAVY STATION AND

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.246
LEARN MORE AND YOU KNOW I TALKED

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.447
HIM THE OTHER NIGHT AND FOUND

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.349
OUT THAT THEY HAVE TO BUY WATER

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.084
WHEN THEY CAN'T DRINK THE TAP

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:18.588
WATER WHICH IS. I MEAN THAT'S

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:21.224
IT'S FOREIGN TO MANY PEOPLE WHO

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.425
YOU KNOW I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:23.559
WHAT YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TURN ON

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.328
YOUR TAP AND DRINK THE WATER BUT

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:26.896
THEY CANNOT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:27.964
THAT'S ON SOME THIRD WORLD

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.999
COUNTRY THAT SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:33.569
FOR GOODNESS SAKE- SO. I THANK

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:36.005
YOU FOR THE INFORMATION- THE

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.106
FOURTEEN BILLION OR YOU KNOW

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:38.774
IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.476
THAT YOU ESTIMATED IT WOULD COST

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.944
TO PUT WHAT WE NEED TO PUT IN

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.780
PLACE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- NOW

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.349
I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAD THAT IN

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:48.150
THE BUDGET THIS YEAR ON THAT WE

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:49.285
COULD HAVE SPENT BUT AGAIN WE

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.753
HAVE TO FACTOR IN THE

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.388
ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS IN THE

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.756
REGULATORY INTERESTS THAT COME

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:56.025
INTO PLAY THAT OFTEN TIMES STOP

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:57.627
PROJECTS LIKE THIS FROM GOING

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.228
FORWARD BUT PERHAPS. THE

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.297
LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.933
AT SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS AND

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.569
POLICIES AND DETERMINE WHETHER

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.571
OR NOT THEY CAN BE ADJUSTED SO

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.806
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE WATER-

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.909
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.911
THINKING MANAGER. THANK YOU

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.580
CENTER MELINDA'S AND THANK YOU

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.982
FOR ON POINTING OUT THAT. THE

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:22.218
CHALLENGES THAT- THAT MANY

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:22.885
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.687
OF CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN AND LACK

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.489
OF ACCESS TO WATER VERTICAL

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.357
LAMAR PORCELAIN MARS AND MY

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.160
SENATE DISTRICT AND- IT'S LIKE

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.762
AS YOU SAID IT'S NOT SOME THIRD

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:36.165
WORLD COUNTRY WE'RE TALKING

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.701
ABOUT. CALIFORNIA THE- YEAH ONE

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.969
OF THE TOP FIVE LARGEST

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.904
ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD- THAT

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.973
SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING AND THAT

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.708
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE ARE YOU

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.511
KNOW HERE TODAY AND- WORKING ON

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:50.379
HUMAN SECURITY ISSUES BECAUSE

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.683
IT'S- IT GOES BEYOND THAT TEND.

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:56.185
AND I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS-

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:59.288
FOR OUR OUR TWO SPEAKERS- I HAVE

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.324
ONE FOR OUR FIRST SPEAKER AND A

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.125
COUPLE COUPLE OF OTHER.

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.860
QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE THEY CAN

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.563
ANSWER ON THE QUESTION THAT I

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.266
HAVE THE FIRST ONE IS- ANOTHER

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:13.235
WAS MENTION OF A LOT OF FUNDS

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.705
FROM PROP ONE FOR STORAGE THAT

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:18.841
WERE USED- AND IN PART AND YOU

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:20.643
KNOW PLEASE FEEL FREE TO-

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.411
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. KIND OF

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.513
ATTRIBUTE IT TO. THE REASON WHY

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.549
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PART WAS

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:29.318
DOING WELL IN TERMS OF- NOT

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.020
REALLY TAPPING A HOLE LOT INTO

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:33.356
THE GROUND WATER. AND I GUESS MY

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:35.891
QUESTION TO THE ALLEY- IS THE

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.828
ALIENS OFFICES DO WE HAVE REALLY

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.097
AN EQUITABLE. A WATER WATER

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.099
STORAGE THROUGHOUT EVERY PART OF

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.868
CALIFORNIA WHERE COMMUNITIES.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.904
ARE LIVE- IF YOU HAVE IT QUICKLY

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:54.643
FEEL FREE

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:57.046
YOU ARE STRONGER I'M- YEAH I

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.382
THINK ONE IMPORTANT POINT IS

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.817
THAT- DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.486
STATE DEPEND ON DIFFERENT

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:06.889
SOURCES OF WATER SO THERE ARE

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.257
THERE IN THE TIME ALLOWED FOR

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.792
EXAMPLE THERE'S A GREAT

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.527
DEPENDENCE ON GROUNDWATER. I'M

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:12.828
IN PART BECAUSE THEY HAVE OUR

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.196
CULTURES THAT HAVE HSTORICALLY

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.799
BEEN ABLE TO STORM WATER AND BE

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.768
WITHDRAWN AND THEN RESELL THAT'S

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:19.902
NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE IN THE

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.404
STATE THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.938
WHERE THERE ISN'T MUCH

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.206
DEPENDENCE ON GROUNDWATER AT ALL

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.008
IT'S ALMOST ALL IN SURFACE WATER

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.510
FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN THE-

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.344
SANDIEGO THERE'S NOT MUCH

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.147
GROUNDWATER- PUMPING OR USAGE.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:32.181
THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:33.349
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THINKING IN

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.084
THE VENTURA AREA WHERE THERE IS

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.685
A QUITE A BIT OF A GROUNDWATER

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:39.488
USAGE BUT OTHER AREAS THAT

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.823
AREN'T SO AND THAT MAKES IT

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.927
COMPLICATED- AND THE NEED FOR

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:47.396
ABOVE GROUND STORAGE VERSES WITH

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:49.865
UNDERGROUND STORAGE VARIES

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.967
AROUND THE STATE- THERE ARE

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.302
PARTS OF THE STATE TO GET A LOT

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.970
OF PRECIPITATION THERE OTHER

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:55.938
BIRDS THAT DON'T GET A LOT OF

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:58.974
PRECIPITATION SO. WE DO NEED TO

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:02.178
PAY A VARIED APPROACH ACROSS THE

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.379
STATE ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:06.015
I AM GIVING MONEY FOR

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.450
GROUNDWATER TO EVERY AREA OF THE

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.984
STATE WOULD MAKE SENSE BECAUSE

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.519
SOME AREAS OF THE STATE DON'T

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.153
HAVE GROUND WATER AND DON'T USE

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.088
IT SO. I THINK THAT DOES

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:16.292
HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF- A

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:18.861
REGIONAL APPROACH AND ENSURING

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.596
THAT EACH REGION GETS WHAT THEY

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.531
NEED I WILL SAY SOME OF THE

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.366
INVESTMENTS IN STORAGE ABOVE

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.001
GROUND STORAGE IN PARTICULAR IN

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:26.869
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.871
FUNDED LOCALLY NOT BY THE STATE-

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.473
BY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

01:08:30.539 --> 01:08:31.841
METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT HAS

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.943
HAS SOME ABOVE GROUND-

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.211
RESERVOIRS THAT THEY'RE THAT

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.946
THEY'RE REPAIRS TO PAY FOR NOT

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:39.081
NOT AND NOT PRIMARILY THROUGH

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:42.518
THE STATE- SO I THINK YOUR POINT

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.954
SENATOR ABOUT EQUITY IS AN

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.755
IMPORTANT ONE. I THINK THE POINT

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.357
THAT I WOULD HIGHLY IN RESPONSE

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.526
IS THAT WE CAN'T TAKE A ONE SIZE

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.393
FITS ALL BECAUSE THAT WILL

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.662
INHERENTLY BE AN EQUITABLE- WE

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.897
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE NEEDS

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.866
ARE OF EACH REGION WHERE THEIR

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.901
WATER SUPPLY COMES FROM WHAT THE

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.369
REPAIRS ARE ABLE TO SUSTAIN

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:01.837
VERSUS AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE A

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.906
RATE BASE THAT CAN'T SUSTAIN IT-

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.975
M. AND WHERE THEY MIGHT BE WORSE

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.776
THE STATE ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:10.513
MEET OUR HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER-

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.680
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.215
COMPLEX PICTURE ACROSS THE STATE

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.684
AS DIVERSE AS OURS. ABSOLUTELY

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.986
AND THANK YOU FOR THAT YES IT'S

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.921
IT IS COMPLICATED AND AT

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.556
DIFFERENT- IT'S NOT ONE SIZE

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:21.857
FITS ALL BUT SOMETHING I ALWAYS

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.626
SAY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:29.632
THAT ANSWER AND. I HAVE A COUPLE

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.399
OTHER QUESTIONS- THERE ARE A

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.067
ALSO MENTION OF IRAQI HEALTH

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.869
YOUR WATER FOR HUMAN HEALTH. IT

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.771
REALLY INTERESTED AND KNOWING- A

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.673
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.909
EXACTLY MEANS FOR THAT DAY

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.077
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES- I

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.713
ALSO ASIDE FROM. THE BUREAU OF

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.582
RECLAMATION WHAT OTHER AENCIES

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.450
IS AT D. W. ARE WORKING WITH TO

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.286
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:52.888
CHALLENGES FACING DELTAS- AND OR

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:56.358
SUBSIDENCE. ISSUES THE OTHER

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.826
QUESTION WHAT MACRO CHANGES

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.361
COULD BE MADE TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:02.565
WATER SYSTEM. AND THE REALITY OF

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.333
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACT ON

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.235
WHETHER WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:10.406
AND- HUMAN FOOD INSECURITY. AND

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.408
HOW DO WE DO WE NEED DO WE NEED

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:13.609
TO LOOK AT MAJORY OPERATION OF

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.744
THE SYSTEM OR CAN WE MAKE

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:16.312
ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPTURE MORE

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:19.348
WATER. MORE EFFICIENTLY FROM

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.550
LIKE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS RIVERS.

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.819
R. L. SO WONDERING- HOW DO WE

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.821
MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.556
WATER SYSTEM FOR PROTECTION

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:28.791
DURING THE WINTER MONTHS BUT

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.060
ALSO FOR WATER SUPPLY FOR FARMS

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:34.563
PEOPLE AND OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.167
SUMMER MONTHS. AND IF THE OTHER

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.669
QUESTION ARE ALL TRIED TO STOP

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.404
THERE AFTER AND WHATEVER YOU DO

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:43.906
YOU CAN ANSWER CRATE AND

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.376
WHATEVER YOU CAN'T- UP AT ANY

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.711
ANY INFORMATION DUMPED ON THE

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.579
ROAD IT'S UP GREATLY APPRECIATED

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.182
AS WELL. BUT THE LAST QUESTION I

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.917
HAVE IS THE ERROR THERE WAS A

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.086
REPORT BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE ON

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.955
THE GLOBAL OUR WATER SECURITY

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.825
AND APPOINTED TO WATER AS- THE

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:05.894
POTENTIAL USE OF THE WEAPON AND

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.730
I'M I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.799
HOW TO WHAT EXTENT YOUR

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:11.900
DEPARTMENTS ARE. B. ALLELES

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.436
OFFICE IS DOING TO COMBAT

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.538
THINGS. THAT COULD BE USED AS

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:20.376
AS- YOU'LL LOVE OUR AS A WEAPON

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.277
OR AS LEVERAGE- ARE WE LOOKING

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.546
AT WHAT MORE WE DOING IN TERMS

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.148
OF WATER THEFT WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.950
IN TERMS OF CYBER THREATS TO

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:31.086
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE- AND OF

01:11:31.153 --> 01:11:33.522
COURSE THERE FOR TWO ALSO OUR

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:36.191
FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN- AT THOSE ARE

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.626
A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ALSO IF

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:40.262
YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT ANY OF

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:46.502
THEM. FEEL FREE. TO LET ME KNOW. ALL RIGHT. I'LL JUMP IN FIRST

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.903
AND I MAY NEED YOU TO REPEAT

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.071
SOME OF THOSE ARE TRYING TO JOT

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.273
DOWN AS MANY AS I COULD BUT-

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.409
THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS-

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:54.209
HONESTLY THERE WAS SOMETHING

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.844
THAT I FORGOT TO MENTION MY LAST

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:56.812
RESPONSE BUT THIS KIND OF I

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.781
THINK I COULD PULL IT. INTO INTO

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:01.950
A DRESS BUT- SO I THINK MAYBE

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.819
THE KIND OF COVER THIS IDEA OF.

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.921
OPERATING THE SYSTEM HAVING SOME

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:09.324
FLEXIBILITY TO CAPTURE WATER

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.427
WHEN WE HAVE THOSE WET EVENTS.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:12.995
THAT ALSO KIND OF FACTORS INTO

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:14.697
SOME OF THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT-

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:16.799
PIECES ONE THING I WANTED TO

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.802
MENTION THAT I DIDN'T WAS- AS

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:24.807
PART OF. THE STATE. BUDGET THAT

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:25.741
WAS RECENTLY PASSED. SLASH

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.311
BUDGET OF PASSED- THE- STATE WAS

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:31.313
AWARDED OVER THREE GW ARE WE

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.215
HAVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:36.318
THAT IS- SLATED FOR WHAT WE'RE

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:37.252
CALLING THE CONVEYANCE OF

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.922
SCIENCE PROGRAM. AND SO THIS IS

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.890
A PROGRAM THAT WE WERE LOOKING

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.892
AT THE- FLOOR OF THE MAJOR WATER

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.461
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IN THE

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.628
STATES OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.963
AQUEDUCT THAT'S PART OF THE

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.567
STATE WATER PROJECT- THE- ST

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.902
LOUIS ADULT. SORRY ST LOUIS

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:57.139
CANAL DELTA MENDOTA CANAL IN THE

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.141
CURRENT TRYING CURRENT CANAL. SO

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:04.713
MAJOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. HAS SUFFERED FROM SUBSIDES.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.949
THE SO HE YOU CAN. AND SOME OF

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.517
THOSE AREAS THE CAPACITY TO MOVE

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.918
WATER HAS BEEN GREATLY

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.087
DIMINISHED OVER THE YEARS AND

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.623
SO- THE STATE HOUSE IS PROVIDING

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.724
FUNDING IT'S A CULTURE

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.026
MECHANISM- SO THE STATE IS

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.195
PUTTING A PORTION THE LOCALS AND

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:22.297
THE FEDS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:25.134
ALSO PUTTING IN THEIR SHARE SHE-

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.603
WE BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SO

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.705
THAT. THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.406
FROM THIS BUDGET YEAR THEY'LL BE

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.041
A HUNDRED MILLION MORE IN THE

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.777
NEXT BUDGET YEAR THAT GO TOWARDS

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:36.845
THIS PARTICULAR EFFORTS- AND

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.447
WHAT THAT DOES OVER IN A COUPLE

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:40.482
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS IS. IT

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:41.984
WITHIN TEN YEARS WILL BE ABLE TO

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.619
INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF WATER

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:44.787
THAT MOVES IN SOME OF THOSE

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.222
AREAS IT'S BEEN DIMINISHED BY

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:49.258
50% OR MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:51.560
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE WATER

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.796
BUT WE HAVE IT MOVE IT THROUGH

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:57.966
THE SYSTEM. WILL HAVE MORE

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:58.567
FLEXIBILITY AROUND THAT. WHAT

01:13:58.634 --> 01:13:59.234
WE'RE ALSO WILL AT THAT I THINK

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:00.669
IS KIND OF IN CONJUNCTION TO

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.704
THIS IS GROUND WATER RECHARGE SO

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.106
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.007
OPPORTUNITIES AND THIS IS A BIG

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:07.109
PART OF. FALLS UNDER THE CIGNA A

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.777
BRAWL IN SOME WAYS BUT IT'S ALSO

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:10.813
REALLY ITS OWN ENTITY I THINK

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.848
UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:15.050
DROUGHT RESILIENCY. ON FLOOD

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.019
MANAGEMENT IS FINDING WAYS TO

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.987
TAKE WATER TAKE THAT EXCESS

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.789
WATER GET IT BACK INTO

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.925
GROUNDWATER- AUTHOR YES

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.360
GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS SH SO THAT

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.628
WE ARE BUILDING BACK THAT

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:28.864
STORAGE SO WE HAVE RESILIENCY

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.232
WHEN AGAIN THE WEATHER TURNS TRY

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.702
INSTRUCTORS WATER IS. LIMITED SO

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:35.571
THAT THESE ARE EFFORTS THAT WE

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.472
ARE WORKING ON NEW CONSTRUCTION

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:38.607
WITH SEVERAL OF OUR STATE

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:42.578
PARTNERS THE STATE WATER BOARD.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.445
HELLO FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT FISH

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.147
WILDLIFE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:46.481
WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:49.685
STREAMS AND- WILDLIFE HABITAT

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.253
AND MAKING SURE THAT'S PART OF

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.855
THE FACTOR IN ADDITION TO THE-

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.724
THE HUMAN NEED FOR WATER- WE ARE

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.392
ALSO WORKING WITH. A LOT OF THE

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.794
LOCAL ENTITIES SO THE

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:00.162
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:03.265
AGENCIES NGOS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.667
TRIBES. WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.469
PARTNERS US BUREAU OF

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.705
RECLAMATION BEING ONE. OF THOSE

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.040
PARTNERS SO IT'S KIND OF A

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:15.177
NETWORK IF YOU WILL A BUS. OR

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.678
WALKED AS WATER AND GIGI'S IN

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:17.980
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.815
TRYING TO COME TOGETHER. TO

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.550
CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY AND

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:23.318
RESILIENCY I THINK THOSE ARE THE

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:25.087
KEY WORDS REALLY FOR ME AS I

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:28.156
LOOK AHEAD- IN TERMS OF HOW TO.

01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:29.858
GET THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:31.860
DURING THE WET. FLOOD PERIOD

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.995
CERTAIN OPTION APPEARS BUT THE

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.530
WET. WEATHER YEARS AND THEN HOW

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.499
TO BE RESILIENT AND MAKE OUR WAY

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:45.007
THROUGH THOSE DRIER PERIODS. IN

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.475
TIME OUR OWN. OPEN FOR CASTING I

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:47.542
THINK THE OTHER PIECE OF IT I

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:48.977
DON'T TALKED A LOT BIT OF- VW

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.346
ARE YOU DON'T AS A- IN. OF

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:52.948
LOOKING AT RAINFALL AT SNOW

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.783
PACKED LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.752
WERE RELEASED RECENTLY BECAUSE

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.086
OF LAST YEAR WERE REALLY

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.022
STARTING TO FIND WAYS TO LOOK AT

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:00.689
THINGS LIKE SOIL MOISTURE

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:03.825
CONTENT- SO WE ARE WORKING TO

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.294
ENHANCE OUR FORECASTING

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.030
ABILITIES. BUT I THINK ALLOW US

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:11.867
TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM IN A WAY

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:12.734
THAT MATCHES THE CONDITIONS. AND

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.202
WE KNOW THE CONDITIONS OF

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:15.938
EXTREME AND THEIR DYNAMIC BUT

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.606
THE- FORECASTING WILL BE A KEY

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.274
ELEMENT THAT I THINK HELPS US BE

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:21.276
ABLE TO OPERATE AND ADJUST THOSE

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.779
OPERATIONS AS NEEDED- GIVEN

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:26.381
WATER THE WATER YEAR BRINGS US.

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:28.216
SO I'M SURE I AM MISSING SOME

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:30.419
ELEMENTS BUT- WANTED TO SHARE

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:32.854
THOSE TOPPLING STRINGS AND WILL

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.457
GLADLY TURN IT OVER TO. THE

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:38.460
SELLERS FOR STOCKS. I DON'T HAVE

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.529
TOO MUCH TO ADD OTHER THAN-

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:42.764
SENATOR I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:43.832
MENTIONED FLOOD IN A DROUGHT

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:46.468
HEARING. BECAUSE THEY DO GO

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:49.571
TOGETHER YEAH I. IN OCTOBER OF

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.373
THIS YEAR OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.742
ONE THE CTY OF SACRAMENTO HAD

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:55.310
SET THE RECORD FOR THE MOST

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.745
NUMBER OF DRY DAYS WITHOUT

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:59.715
PRECIPITATION. IN ON RECORD TWO

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.183
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DAYS AND

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:02.851
THEN A FEW DAYS LATER SET THE

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:04.486
RECORD FOR THE MOST RAINFALL

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:05.721
WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:08.023
PERIOD. SO WE JUST A FEW DAYS

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:10.025
APART THOSE TWO DIFFERENT.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.693
RECORDS SO I THINK THAT JUST

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.762
HIGHLIGHTS THE EXTREMES THAT WE

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.163
ARE FACING UNDER UNDER CLIMATE

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.433
CHANGE AND- IN ORDER TO PREPARE

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.035
AND SUSTAIN THROUGH DROUGHTS WE

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.770
HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.872
REALLY FLASHY WENT STORMS THAT

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:24.539
WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:28.844
OF SO- I. GO AWAY AND THIS

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:29.978
SEMESTER SAID ABOUT THE

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.780
IMPORTANCE OF MANAGED AQUIFER

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.181
RECHARGE HOW DO WE GET THOSE

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.649
FLOOD WATERS NOT ONLY NOT

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:37.285
CLEANING PEOPLE'S HOMES BUT ALSO

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:39.254
IN THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN SLOW

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.223
THEM SPREAD THEM SYNC THEM TO

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.891
GET THAT WATER INTO THE GROUND.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.192
AND THEN ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.094
FORECASTING SO THAT WE KNOW

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.529
WHAT'S COMING WHEN IT'S COMING

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.064
SO THAT WE'RE NOT DRAINING OUR

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.400
RESERVOIRS TO CREATE RANDOM. FOR

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:52.734
FLOOD CONTROL WHEN WE'RE NOT

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:54.136
GONNA GET STOPPED BECAUSE I MEAN

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.071
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO. CREATE

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.172
THAT EMPTY ROOM IN THE

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.473
RESERVOIRS WE CAN STORE THAT

01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.541
WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.376
STORM COMING- AND THEN WHEN A

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:03.345
STORM IS COMING HOW CAN WE

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.047
PREPARE FOR AND HOW CAN WE BUILD

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.348
THE FACILITIES AND IT AND IT IS

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.717
GONNA TAKE CONSTRUCTION- AN

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.852
INFRASTRUCTURE. OF WEIGHT HOW DO

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:13.155
WE GET THE WATER WHERE IT CAN BE

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.723
SUNK AND THEN HOW DO WE GET THE

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.124
WATER FROM THERE TO WHERE IT IS

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.660
NEEDED SO- IN THINKING ABOUT

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.862
INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD SAY IT'S

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.364
NOT JUST A BIG ABOVE THE GROUND

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.066
DAMS AND RESERVOIRS ANYMORE I

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:26.068
THINK THAT THAT FUTURE IS REALLY

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.670
THINKING ABOUT- THIS CONJUNCTIVE

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.039
USE SPAN. AND IN PARTICULAR

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:33.075
FLOOD WATERS AND GROUNDWATER AND

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:38.380
HOW DO WE. CAPTURE THAT WATER

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.816
AND THEN YOU SAID. WELL I WILL.

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.918
LEAVE MY QUESTION IN THT THAT-

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:46.021
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU BOTH- I

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:48.423
REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:50.459
YOU'VE TAKEN- HERE. NEAR THE

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.295
HOLIDAYS- TO COME OUT AND TALK

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:55.363
ABOUT WATER AND THAT THE DROUGHT

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.399
OF COURSE AND- AND REALLY LIKE

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.667
INCENTIVE BUT THIS REALLY IS

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:02.304
ABOUT- THE HUMAN IMPACTS THAT-

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.606
THAT. THAT THE DROUGHT- AND THE

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.641
CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE SO

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:07.876
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO BOTH BUT

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:09.411
BUT ONE LAST THING THAT A LOSS

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:12.214
FROM THIS- PANEL IS IF I COULD

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.450
HAVE COPIES OF THE SLIDE DECK SO

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.085
WE CAN. REVIEW OUR- DOWN THE

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:22.457
DOWN THE ROAD. ABSOLUTELY THANK

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:24.226
YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.895
OKAY OUR NEXT STOP ISN'T PANEL

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.363
OVER TO THE KID AND HUMAN

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.500
IMPACTS OF FOOD HEALTH AND LABOR

WE HAVE OUR FIRST STOP- LESLIE

I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF THE WIFI

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.137
HERE IS A LITTLE BIT UNSTABLE SO

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:10.639
I'M JUST CROSSING MY FINGERS

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.474
THAT IT'LL STAY FOR THIS PART OF

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:17.812
THE PRESENTATION- THIS WE'RE

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:20.248
GONNA HAVE A BIT OF A CHANGE IN

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:22.984
THIS IN MY PRESENTATION AWAY

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:23.485
FROM CALIFORNIA'S REALLY

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:27.422
INTERESTING. L. EXPLANATION OF

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.857
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CALIFORNIA

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.992
WATER CALIFORNIA DROUGHT. AND TO

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.460
MOVE TO A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:36.097
DIFFERENT POINT OF PERSPECTIVE.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:48.276
OKAY PUT THE SOCK. OKAY. S. S.

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:50.879
THAT OKAY GET READY SET. YES WE

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:54.749
CAN OKAY GOOD SO LIVING AWAY

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:57.018
FROM CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE SORT

01:20:57.085 --> 01:21:00.055
OF TAKING A PERSPECTIVE OF FOOD

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.524
SECURITY AS USED BY THE FOOD AND

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.459
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:07.262
UNITED NATIONS. LOOKING FOR USE

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.497
IN THAT PERSPECTIVE TO LOOK AT.

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:10.732
WHAT ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.634
DROUGHT IMPACTS AND WHAT WE SING

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.569
ALSO WHAT'S CHANGING ABOUT IT.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.238
S. SOME OF WHICH WILL BE OF

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.639
COURSE NOT AS RELEVANT

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.773
CALIFORNIA SOME OF THAT WILL BE

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.408
VERY RELEVANT BUT IN BOTH CASES

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.410
I THINK WILL HELP. SORT OF

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:23.745
CLARIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES OF

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:27.349
HUMAN IMPACT SINK IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:30.485
. L- WILL ALSO BRING IN A LITTLE

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.786
BIT OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT CAME

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:35.090
UP THIS YEAR IN THE FATHER WAS A

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.825
U. N. FOOD SYSTEM SUMMIT. WERE

01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:38.860
ALSO SOME OF THE DROUGHT AND

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.362
WATER MANAGEMENT AGRICULTURE AND

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:42.430
HUMAN IMPACTS. GOT A LOT OF

01:21:42.497 --> 01:21:44.165
DISCUSSIONS GOING TO BRING IN A

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:48.737
LITTLE BIT OF THAT. SO THIS

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.538
FRAMEWORK THE FOODSECURITY

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:52.907
FRAMEWORK IS ONE THAT'S VERY

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.142
WIDELY USED WITHIN THE UNITED

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:55.610
NATIONS CERTAINLY WITH A VERY

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.779
BIG INTO FOOD RAGER CULTURE

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:01.016
WORLD. IT STARTED IN- THE

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.250
SEVENTIES IN AN

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:03.918
INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETING WHERE

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.153
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ON WHAT

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.489
HOW SHOULD WE DEFINE. WHAT WE'RE

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.691
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:10.325
SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO

01:22:10.392 --> 01:22:12.727
EAT. AT A DATE THERE WAS A GOOD

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:14.462
AGREEMENT ON A DEFINITION WHICH

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:15.163
IS NOT THE ONE THAT'S ON THE

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.299
SLIDE. THE ONE THAT'S ON THE

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.200
SLIDE IN GREEN IS WHAT THE

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.269
CURRENT DEFINITION. BUT THERE'S

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.305
STILL A LOT OF- EVOLUTION IN THE

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.273
THINKING. IN PARTICULAR AROUND

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.741
THE FOUR PILLARS THAT IT YOU CAN

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.777
SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.512
AVAILABILITY ACCESS UTILIZATION

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.580
INSTABILITY. BECAUSE IN THE

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:35.617
FIRST PHASE OF THINKING ABOUT.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:38.353
FOOD SECURITY IN GENERAL NOT

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.220
SPECIFIC TO DRUG TEST FOOD

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.556
SECURITY THE REAL EMPHASIS WAS

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.458
ON SUPPLY AVAILABILITY LIKE DO

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.727
CAN WE PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD FOR

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.629
THIS GROWING POPULATION. AND

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:50.231
THEIR FOOD NEEDS. BUT BY THE

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.599
EIGHTIES IT BECAME PRETTY CLEAR

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:55.804
THAT. ACCESS WAS UNLESS IT WAS

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.238
ACTUALLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:58.239
AN ACCESS MEANS COULD YOU GET

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.141
THE FOOD IF IT'S EVEN IF IT'S

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.043
THERE EVEN IF IT'S IN YOUR LOCAL

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.878
SUPERMARKET CAN YOU AFFORD TO

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:06.114
BUY IT. BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.116
MORE EVIDENCE OF. THERE IS

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:09.818
PLENTY OF FOOD AROUND BUT PEOPLE

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:10.952
ARE STILL GOING HUNGRY BECAUSE

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.854
THEY LACK ACCESS AND THE REASON

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.689
THEY LACKED ACCESS WAS BECAUSE

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.558
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INCOME.

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:19.728
OR BECAUSE FOOD PRICES. MORE

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:21.663
RISING UP TO EIGHT AND OF COURSE

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.098
IT'S RELATIVE FOOD PRICE TO

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:24.065
INCOME SO THEY COULDN'T AFFORD

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.334
IT. FILLED IN THE AXIS DIMENSION

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.903
IT WAS VERY MUCH A LOT OF

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:29.504
CONCERN AROUND THROUGH PRICES

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:31.506
AND ALSO. INCOME OF THE POOREST

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:34.209
PEOPLE. OF IRAN WHICH IN THE

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:36.444
WORLD IS OFTEN IN AGRICULTURE

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.279
AND I THINK ALSO IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.914
NOT EVEN CALIFORNIA IS QUITE A

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:41.416
DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN MANY OF

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.817
THE YOU KNOW AGRICULTURAL

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.418
DOMINANT ECONOMIES AROUND THE

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:48.823
WORLD. BUT GLOBALLY THE ROOM

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.459
MATE IN MOST MOST POOR PEOPLE IN

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.761
THE WORLD ARE STILL LOCATED IN

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.496
RURAL AREAS AND HAVE SOME KIND

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.431
OF DEPENDENCE ON AGRICULTURE SO

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.767
THE AXIS DIMENSION IS REALLY KEY

01:23:58.833 --> 01:23:59.934
IN LOOKING AT AGRICULTURE.

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:04.873
INCOME N. WORKERS THEN ALONG

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:07.475
CAME UTILIZATION WHICH IS IT

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.411
STILL YOU KNOW BEING DEVELOPED

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:10.712
THEY DISCUSSED A LOT NOW IN

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.214
CONTEXT OF NUTRITION UTILIZATION

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:15.150
REFERS TO CONSUMING FOOD

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.485
PREPARING IT CHILLED FOOD

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.487
STORAGE AND FOOD SAFETY. AND

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.456
MORE RECENTLY THIS BIG EMPHASIS

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:24.426
ON LOOKING ON IT IT'S THE

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:27.429
NUTRIENT CONTENT. BECAUSE WHEN

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.230
ED IT YET DID THE SAME THING SO

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:30.765
FROM THE NINETIES ON WHEN YOU

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.667
HAD ENOUGH CALORIES BEING

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:36.004
PRODUCED. IN FACT TOO MUCH SO

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.071
THAT YOU GOT PROBLEMS WITH

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:38.706
OBESITY BUT LACK OF

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:40.475
MICRONUTRIENTS PEOPLE WERE

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.944
UNHEALTHY THIS CAUSED REALLY

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.947
SERIOUS. THAT NON COMMUNICABLE

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:46.948
DISEASE PROBLEMS BIG HEALTH

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:49.451
COSTS AND MORTALITY SO

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.152
UTILIZATION IS SORT OF LOOKING

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:52.587
AT THAT THE NUTRITIONAL SIDE OF

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:54.823
FOOD SAFETY. AND THEN THE LAST

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.025
ONE IS STABILITY WHICH IS- GOT

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:58.326
MUCH MORE ATTENTION I WAS

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.328
FINALLY CHANGED AND THIS IS

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:01.162
WHERE YOU SEE A LOT ABOUT

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.831
DROUGHT TOO BECAUSE THEY

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.632
INCREASE INCIDENCE AND-

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:07.602
FREQUENCY AND THE DEPTHS OF

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:11.873
EXTREME EVENTS. SO THAT HE

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.474
WOULDN'T BE FOOD SECURE IF YOU

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.975
HAD TO. HEY YOU KNOW I AVAILABLE

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.210
SUPPLY AND YOU COULD AFFORD IT

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.678
BUT IT WAS UNCERTAIN IT WAS

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:18.847
UNRELIABLE SO THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:21.216
LAST MENTIONS ABOUT. SO IN THE

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.484
REST OF THE PRESENTATION I WANT

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.752
TO DO WITH FOR THE NEXT PART IS

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:27.689
JUST WALK A BIT THROUGH THESE-

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:29.624
MENTIONS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:32.026
DATE IT TO DROUGHT IN IN

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.697
DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. BUT FIRST

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:39.734
ACTUALLY- FROM THIS SIDE. THIS

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.102
IS A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT OF

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:42.303
THE PHARAOH THE FOOD AND

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.738
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION THIS

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:46.241
YEAR LOOKING AT IMPACTS OF

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.208
DISASTERS AND CRISES ON

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:48.810
AGRICULTURE I THOUGHT IT WAS

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.411
REALLY INTERESTING THAT DROUGHT

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:52.347
STICKS OUT LIKE THIS IS THE ONE

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.883
THIS 34% IT HAS THE LARGEST

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:58.720
SHARE. I WISH. IS THE BIGGEST

01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:00.788
CAUSE OF LOSS OF CROP AND

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:04.726
LIVESTOCK. COMPARED TO ALL THESE

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.127
OTHER KINDS OF DISASTER CROP

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:07.896
BRETT PESCE STORMS EARTHQUAKES

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.398
FLOODS EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:12.567
WILDFIRES. HEY I WAS ACTUALLY

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:14.168
NOTICED PRESENCE OF FLOODS WOULD

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:16.271
HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER THAN DRUGS

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.506
BUT- DROUGHT IS A REALLY BIG

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.308
PROBLEM FOR AGRICULTURE IS A

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:22.343
MAJOR SOURCE OF THE LOSS IN

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.245
AGRICULTURE IS THE S. SECTOR

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:26.347
GLOBALLY. AREAS BY DIFFERENT

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:29.017
PLACES BUT I WILL CHOOSE A

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:30.985
SECTOR THAT REALLY ABSORBS THE

01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:32.620
COST OF DROUGHT MUCH MORE THAN

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.589
OTHER SECTORS SAY FLOODING OR

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.324
SOME OF THESE OTHER. EXTREME

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:39.928
EVENTS. THE DAMAGE THE COST OF

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.797
THE DAMAGE IS SPREAD ACROSS IN A

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:43.398
DIFFERENT SECTOR SAY INDUSTRY

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:46.234
URBAN. OR AS DROUGHT HAS A VERY

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:48.303
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THE COST IS

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:53.174
IN AGRICULTURE. OKAY SO. JUST

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.509
GOING THROUGH THE FOUR

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:57.178
DIMENSIONS OF FOOD SECURITY FOR

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.514
STARTING WITH AVAILABILITY I PUT

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:01.616
THIS A SLIDE UP IT'S FROM

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:03.785
GUARDIAN ARTICLE FROM SEPTEMBER

01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:05.420
IT'S KIND OF THE CLASSIC DROUGHT

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:09.357
SLIDE OF. THE DROUGHT KENYA. TWO

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:10.992
POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.428
OF STARVATION BUT IMPORTANT TO

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:14.429
RECOGNIZE HERE THIS IS FROM

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:16.264
NORTHERN KENYA THIS IS THE PLACE

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.599
THAT IS TOTALLY RELIANT ON

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.701
RAINFALL IT'S VERY ISOLATED NOT

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.369
LINKED TO OTHER MARKETS. VERY

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.204
FEW OPTIONS IN TERMS OF GETTING

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:26.407
FOOD. ANDIT GROWING FOOD IN THE

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.976
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD IS MOSTLY

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.945
PASTORALIST AND THERE'S VERY FEW

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:32.680
OPTIONS THERE SO. THIS IS WHERE

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.215
YOU HAD TO SORT OF LIKE OLD

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.917
SEVENTIES KIND OF REALLY BIG

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:36.951
CONCERN THAT WHEN YOU WERE IN

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:38.753
THESE KINDS OF VERY. LIMITED

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.588
COMMUNITIES LIMITED OPTION

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:43.491
COMMUNITIES. AT THE END OF THEIR

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:44.892
RAINFALL DEPENDENT AND THERE'S

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:49.130
STILL PLENTY OF- THAT- DROUGHT.

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:52.033
REDUCING THE FOOD PRODUCTION IN

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.969
THAT AREA IS A DISASTER. BUT

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.705
IT'S NOT THE ONLY ASPECT ON

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:59.440
AVAILABILITY IN DROUGHT IMPACTS

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:00.875
THEIR SPECIFICITIES DISS THE

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:03.177
SLIDE THAT COMES FROM A STUDY

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:03.678
THAT WAS DONE LOOKING AT

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:05.680
AUSTRALIA WHICH HAS. YOU KNOW A

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.682
DIFFERENT AND MUCH MORE

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.050
INDUSTRIALIST TYPE OF

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.019
AGRICULTURAL MODEL NOT. IS

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:13.354
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR I THINK IN SOME

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:14.889
WAYS CALIFORNIA BUT- THE POINT

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.725
OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS. THE AUTHOR

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.494
IS ESTIMATED TO WHAT YOU WOULD

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.962
EXPECT THE PRODUCTIVITY OF

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:22.196
AGRICULTURE TO BE THE

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.431
PRODUCTIVITY BEING THAT THAT

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.166
HERE YOU ARE USING A MEASURE

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:27.635
CALLED TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:31.272
SO- WHAT YOU WOULD GET. OUT IT

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.241
IS IT IS IT FORCES EVERYTHING

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:34.909
THAT YOU PUT IN SO FOR ALL THE

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.078
LABOR THE WATER THE TIME DELAY

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:39.914
AND HOW MUCH OUTPUT YOU GET IS.

01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:42.884
IT SO ACCORDING TO THE MODEL OF

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.952
WHAT WAS BEING USED IN THE LAND

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:46.120
QUALITY ALL THESE KINDS OF

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.356
THINGS THE DOTTED LINE IS WHAT

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.991
YOU WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE SEEN

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:50.958
THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.293
AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURE COURSE

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:53.661
PRODUCTIVITY IS REALLY RELATED

01:28:53.728 --> 01:28:57.231
TO THE RETURNS. AND TODAY TODAY

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:58.633
PROFITABILITY OF AGRICULTURE.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.335
INSTEAD IT DAVID THE SOLID LINE

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.071
IS WHAT THE ACTUAL PRODUCTIVITY

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:05.106
MEASURES WORK AND THIS WAS

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.275
DURING A PERIOD OF DROUGHT. BUT

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.944
ALSO AFTER. SO THAT THERE'S-

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.446
SOME SUGGESTION THAT THERE'S

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.880
LONGER TERM IMPACTS EVEN ON

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:14.182
PRODUCTIVITY AND THIS WOULD HAVE

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:16.584
BEEN IN IN IMPLICATIONS FOR.

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:18.720
OVERALL FOOD PRINT PRODUCTION IN

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.955
THE WHERE THE VEIL ABILITY

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:24.125
DIMENSION OF FOOD SECURITY. THE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:27.161
TO- ACCESS OKAY SO AN ACCESS

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:28.796
YOUR MEMBER IS LIKE YOU CAN YOU

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.565
AFFORD TO GET THE STUDENTS AND-

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.033
THEY HAVE THINGS TO LOOK AT

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.435
THERE IS FOOD PRICE. WILL AFFECT

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:35.937
ALL CONSUMERS AND FOOD PRICES

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.039
ARE ON AN UPWARD TREND BUT

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:41.275
THERE'S A LOT O BIG DIFFERENCES

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:42.043
AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE.

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:45.046
BUT THE OTHER BIG IMPACT OF

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.914
ACCESS BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.349
LOOKING AT CLOSELY AS AG

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:50.184
AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.853
REMEMBER THAT'S PART OF IT IF

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:54.756
YOU IF YOUR INCOME. IS REDUCED.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.591
YOU WILL HAVE LESS ABILITY TO

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.626
BUY FOOD IMPORT PEOPLE. AND A

01:29:58.693 --> 01:29:59.727
MUCH LARGER SHARE OF THEIR

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:03.264
INCOME ON FOOD SO IT'S A IT'S A

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:05.933
GOOD PRICE. N. EIGHT CAN

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.835
DECREASE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.036
MAJOR IMPACT ON POOR PEOPLE.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:12.240
WHAT WE SEE HERE I WAS LOOKING

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:12.774
ACROSS A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:16.010
STUDIES BUT- BECAUSE I JUST

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.478
EXPECTED THAT YOU WOULD NEVER

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:19.413
NORMALLY SEE THAT. DURING A

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.815
DROUGHT IN A PLACE THAT IS

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.116
EXPERIENCING DROUGHT IN

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:24.418
AGRICULTURAL LOCATION YOU WOULD

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:27.455
EXPECT TO SEE LESS EMPLOYMENT

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:28.523
PEOPLE LOSING JOBS ARE LOSING

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:31.692
OURS. IT WASN'T ALWAYS THE CASE

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.094
AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.662
IS IN SOME CASESTHAT YOU SAW

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:36.297
THE RESPONSE TO DROUGHT WAS THAT

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.865
FARMERS WERE PUTTING IN MORE

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:40.268
LABOR INTENSIVE TYPES OF CROPS.

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.370
SO THAT ACTUALLY DREW IN MORE

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.705
LABOR. I THINK ANOTHER ISSUE

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:47.642
THOUGH IN LOOKING AT SOME OF

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:48.943
THOSE STUDIES THIS- IT TAKES

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.678
TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE IMPACTS

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:53.114
OF THE DROUGHT THAT DATE THEY

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:55.149
BUILD UP OVER TIME SO. FOR

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.218
EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE STUDIES

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.753
FROM BRAZIL IS LOOKING OVER THE

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.855
PERIOD F NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:01.522
TWENTY TEN SO THEY HAD A REALLY

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:02.890
LONG PERIOD AND THEY REALLY

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:05.193
DETAILED LOOKING AT. THE DROUGHT

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:06.594
IN THESE LITTLE COMMUNITIES AND

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:08.429
WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY FOUND BIG

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:10.565
IMPACTS THEY FOUND BIG COMMUNITY

01:31:10.631 --> 01:31:14.402
LEVEL IMPACTS. OF THAT FIRST ON

01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:20.141
THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR. THIS IS

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.609
SOME OF THE BUSINESSES GO BROKE.

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:23.878
YOU SEE THIS KIND OF-

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:27.348
ABANDONMENT OF HOUSES AND TOWNS

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:30.818
. BASICALLY IT BIG OUT MIGRATION

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:32.053
ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:36.457
SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT YOU KNOW

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.192
AN UNAMBIGUOUS THING THAT

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:39.627
DROUGHT WILL ALWAYS GIVE YOU

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:43.030
LOWER- AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:46.500
AND THEREFORE LOWER INCOME. BUT

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.569
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS MAYBE IT

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:49.670
TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO FIGURE

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:50.738
OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE FULL

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:52.640
IMPACTS ARE AND THEY CAN BE

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:54.742
QUITE IMPORTANT IN LOOKING AT

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:55.276
THE OVERALL FOOD SECURITY

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.646
IMPACTS. ANOTHER STUDY FROM

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.448
AUSTRALIA WAS LOOKING AT.

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:03.985
SEVERAL INDICATORS. OF INCOME

01:32:04.051 --> 01:32:05.419
AND THEY ALSO WERE LOOKING AT

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:07.088
MENTAL HEALTH AND MEDICATION AND

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:09.156
DRINKING WHICH I'M NOT GONNA GET

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:09.724
INTO I THINK OTHERS WILL BE

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:12.627
DISCUSSING THAT BUT- THE THING

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:13.194
THAT WAS INTERESTING HERE IS

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:15.496
THAT. THIS SITE HAS THREE

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.366
COLUMNS SO THIS IS THE ONE TO

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.534
FOR THIS TO THE LEFT HERE IS.

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:22.370
LOOKING AT THE HIGHEST THE MOST

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:24.138
SEVERE DROUGHT THIS IS KIND OF

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.740
PRETTY BAD DROUGHT IN THIS IS

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:29.043
BAD BUT BUT THE LEAST BAD. SO

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:30.645
WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT IN TERMS OF

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:33.381
INCOME AFFECTS IT'S ONLY IN THE

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.416
REALLY REALLY BAD DROUGHT. YOU

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:37.184
GET A HUGE NEGATIVE HIT ON

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:39.020
INCOME AND THERE'S ASTERIX KENO

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:40.187
INDICATING THAT IT'S

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:42.256
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WHAT

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:43.858
IS ITS NEGATIVE HERE IN THE BAT

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:46.394
PRETTY BAD. BUT IT'S NOT IT'S

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.529
NOT SIGNIFICANT SO THE RIGHT THE

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:49.363
RESULT ON INCOME IS REALLY LIKE

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:52.300
OKAY. IT MAKES YOU THINK. YES

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:54.669
DRUGS SEEMS TO BE HAVING. IT

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.671
IMPACTS ON INCOME THEY WERE

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.539
LOOKING AT REAL INCOMES AS WELL

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:03.377
AS NON RURAL- THEY THEY FIND

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.112
FURTHER IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.882
STRESS ACROSS THIS PRETTY BAD

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:10.418
PLACE. BUT THE IN THE ACTUAL

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.219
IMPACTS AN INCOME DIDN'T SHOW

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.654
THROUGH HERE AND THAT COULD ALSO

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:14.989
BE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE SAVINGS

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:17.959
IN THAT IT'S AGAIN A TIME THING

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:18.526
LIKE I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:21.095
OVER TIME. BUT AGAIN ON THAT YOU

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:23.798
WOULD EXPECT. CERTAINLY I THINK

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:24.832
IF YOU TALK TO CALIFORNIA FOR

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:27.268
RESEARCH THAT DROUGHT WILL HAVE

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:30.438
SOME IMPACT ON FARMING. A MOVE

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.540
INTO THE FOURTH THE FIFTH THIRD

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:35.109
DIMENSIONAL STABILITY. AT THE

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:36.410
END I JUST PUT THE SLIDE HERE

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.346
SHOWING THAT THE INCREASING

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:40.147
NUMBER OF EXTREME EVENTS

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:42.984
STABILITY ISN'T A BIG CONCERN

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:43.884
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST BEEN SO

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:45.553
MANY HITS TO AGRICULTURAL

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:48.789
PRODUCTION. L. AND S. TROOPS

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.959
EXTREME EVENTS AND THAT'S IT

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.728
IT'S BECOMING MUCH FOR- MUCH

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.896
MORE PRIORITY INSISTED SECURITY

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:58.232
PROGRAMS. AND THE LAST ONES ON

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.501
UTILIZATION AND A LOT OF STUDIES

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:04.005
AND DROUGHT IN DROUGHT AREAS

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.906
WITH AGRICULTURAL POPULATION

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:08.542
WHICH SHOW THAT PEOPLE START TO

01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:10.211
SHIFT TOWARDS LESS NUTRIENT

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:12.580
DENSE DIETS AS THEY BECAUSE

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:13.347
THEY'RE LOSING INCOME OR THEY'RE

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:15.282
LOSING PRODUCTION. SO THEY TEND

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:17.852
TO EAT WORSE NUTRITIONALLY AND

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:18.486
THEN THIS HAS LONG TERM HEALTH

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.654
IMPACTS. THERE'S ALSO INCREASE

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:22.456
OF FOOD SAFETY PROBLEMS DUE TO

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:24.291
LACK OF GOOD WATER DRINKING

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:25.626
WATER WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:28.329
THAT THAT'S THAT'S SUCH AN ISSUE

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:29.730
IN CALIFORNIA. AT INCREASED RISK

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:31.766
OF WATER CONTAMINATION AND ALSO

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:33.100
CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.635
INCIDENCE OF PARASITES BACTERIA

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:39.073
VIRUSES. AT A. POSSIBILITY IN

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.342
NIGHT THIS IS NOT A DISEASE

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:43.878
TRANSMISSION SO FOOD SAFETY IS

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:46.814
THE REAL CONCERN AROUND. THE S.

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:50.451
SCARCITY OF WATER. SO WHAT ARE

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.720
PEOPLE DOING IN THIS IS REALLY A

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.889
QUICK IN AND OUT A QUICK AND

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:57.324
DIRTY ANALYSIS BUT JUST LOOKING

01:34:57.391 --> 01:35:00.161
THROUGH THOSE FOR- DIMENSIONS ON

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:02.696
THE AVAILABILITY WHAT I THINK I

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.298
HEAR A LOT OF. CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.900
ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE IT'S

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.701
BUILDING STORAGE IS FILLING IN

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.870
FOR IRRIGATION- THERE'S ALSO A

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:12.239
LOT OF WORK ON BUILDING AT YOU

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.474
KNOW GETTING FARMERS TO USE

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.543
DROUGHT TOLERANT VARIETIES. AND

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:17.344
THEN. IN SOME CASES

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:20.714
PARTICULARLY. IN SAY LIKE AFRICA

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.083
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST LOOKING

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:23.084
FOR NEW MARKET SOURCE TO GET

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:26.387
FOOD. AS AS THE DAY TRADITIONAL

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:28.155
ONES BECOME LESS RELIABLE I MEAN

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.256
IN THE CASE OF THE KENYA'S

01:35:29.323 --> 01:35:30.257
LETTER SHOWED EARLIER THIS

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.093
SOURCE OF TRUTH EMERGENCY FOOD

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:35.229
RELIEF FROM. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM-

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.464
THE NEW MARKET SOURCES CAN BE

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:38.032
KIND OF PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE TO

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:40.701
ACTUALLY IMPORT FOOD FIRST OF

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:41.435
ALL BUT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE A

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:43.571
HIGH DEBT. OF FOOD IMPORTS

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.506
ALREADY AND IT'S IN THERE PAYING

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.641
INTEREST ON IT SECONDLY YOU NEED

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:48.909
A PRETTY ADVANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:51.178
TO GET. FOD OUT TO PEOPLE LIKE

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:53.347
IN THAT THAT PASTORAL AREA. BUT

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:54.315
NONE THE LESS THE- THE OF

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:57.685
INVISIBILITY THERE'S A FOCUS ON-

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:02.456
IMPROVING. THE RESILIENCE OF

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.057
PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. AT THE END

01:36:03.124 --> 01:36:04.558
OF CLIMATE OUT OF. THERE'S A

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:05.893
DISCUSSION OF INCREMENTAL

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.361
ADAPTATIONS FOR THAT YOU'RE

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.597
DOING KIND OF. WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:10.998
BEEN DOING THAT BETTER SELECT

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.734
SAY A GROWING- YOU RICE THAT

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:15.236
DROUGHT TOLERANT RICE ARE YOU

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.370
USING A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.472
IRRIGATION METHOD THAT'S FOR. IT

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:22.143
YOU KNOW WATER. EGG EFFICIENT.

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.978
L. BUT THERE'S THE INCREASING

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.346
CALLS FOR MORE TRANSFORMATIVE

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:27.214
FORMS TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THE

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:28.649
MAJOR SHIFTS THAT ARE BEING

01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:30.584
IMPOSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.453
DROUGHT IS ONE OF THEM. AND THE

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.888
ACCESS SIDE WHAT'S BEEN REALLY

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.656
SUCCESSFUL IS SOME SAFETY NET

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:37.091
PROGRAMS THEN THERE'S A LOT OF

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:38.926
TIMES IS FOOD FOOD TRANSFERS BUT

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.895
ALSO CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS HAVE

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.063
BECOME VERY POPULAR. I MEAN THIS

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.398
ISN'T THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.200
WHEN IT DEPENDING ON LOCAL FOOD

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:48.836
SUPPLIES. AND SO THEIR THEIR THE

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:52.640
DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM HAS. IT IS

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:55.276
VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HOW

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:57.645
SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE. BUT OVERALL

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:58.812
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE EXPANSION IN

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.648
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IN IN

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:04.118
AFRICA. AND SOUTH ASIA ALSO IN

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.953
LATIN AMERICA WAS STILL ONE OF

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.788
THE PIONEERS AND BRAZIL. AND

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.123
IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:11.325
MAINTAINING CERTAIN LEVELS OF

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:14.195
FOOD SECURITY- BUT NOW LOOKING

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.930
AT THE AG EMPLOYMENT ISSUE LIKE

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:18.832
SO. BUT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.734
BIGGEST ISSUES I THINK COME AND

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.436
THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE FOOD

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:25.973
SYSTEM SUMMIT. THEY'RE STILL HIT

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.642
A BILLION WHERE. HUGE NUMBER OF

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:30.945
VERY POOR PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN

01:37:31.011 --> 01:37:32.513
AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.949
RELATED AND- ACTIVITIES IN THIS

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.684
IS ALSO WHERE THERE'S STILL

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.052
REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF POPULATION

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:41.288
GROWTH. THE AG PRODUCTIVITY ON

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.524
THOSE FARMS FARMS VERY SMALL

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:45.025
FIVE FARM SIZES ARE GETTING

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.127
UNDER ONE ACTOR. IT'S NOT REALLY

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:48.596
CLEAR THAT YOU CAN DO ANY KIND

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.664
OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY OR

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:52.466
MARKETING SCHEME THAT WOULD

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:53.167
REALLY LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.102
POVERTY AND SO THERE'S A LOT

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.904
MORE FOCUS ON TRAINING AND

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.038
LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.740
EMPLOYMENT BUT PARTICULARLY IN

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:02.042
AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS. WHICH

01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:04.545
UP TO IN THE PAST IT HAS BEEN

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.714
MUCH MORE OF A FOCUS ON SAY

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.816
LABOR SUBSTITUTION AS YOU. MOVE

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:10.551
INTO FOOD PROCESSING YOU LOOK

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:11.919
FOR EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.887
PLACED LABORS INSTEAD OF LIKE

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:15.656
SAY EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD LABORS

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:16.690
WOULD USE TO INCREASE THEIR

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:20.261
PRODUCTIVITY SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:22.129
DISCUSSION THERE ABOUT- SAFETY

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:23.964
NET PROGRAMS CAN ONLY TAKE YOU

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:26.867
SO FAR IN SO LONG. WE NEED TO

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:28.836
LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES BUT-

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:30.671
NOT MAYBE ON THE FARM MAYBE NEAR

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:33.607
THE FARM. ON STABILITY ALSO

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.442
QUITE A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:36.644
REGIS MANAGEMENT THINGS

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.179
STABILIZING FOOD PRICE PROGRAM

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.382
STATE STORAGE BUFFER STOCKS ALSO

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:43.751
AGREEMENTS TO AVOID SAY EXPORT

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:45.352
BANS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:48.722
PROBLEMS OF THE FOOD PRICE BY.

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:49.723
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EXPERIMENTAL

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:51.859
INSURANCE LIKE THE INDEX

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:54.895
INSURANCE PROGRAM SET FOR. FULL

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:55.829
SCALE FARMERS THAT'S HAD KIND OF

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:59.400
MIXED. RESULTS THAT DIDN'T COME

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.302
IN A COUPLE OF CASES HAS WORKED

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.404
A LOT OF CASES AND PROBLEMATIC.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:05.973
TRADE TRADE HAS BEEN INCREASING

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.841
TRADE NETWORKS HAS BEEN A REALLY

01:39:07.908 --> 01:39:10.110
SUCCESSFUL WAY OF STABILIZING

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:12.212
FOOD SUPPLIES AND FOOD PRICES.

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:14.081
FINALLY ON UTILIZATION THERE'S-

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.716
YOU KNOW USING SUBSIDIES ON

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:18.419
VOUCHERS TO GO TO MAKES THIS

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.187
COULD INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:21.955
INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO YOU.

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.757
CONSUME NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS OF

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:26.060
LAKE CALIFORNIA AND SAM THAT'S

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:28.329
NOT SO FOR IT'S JUST. THAT KIND

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.631
OF THING WHICH IS MY OFFICE-

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:33.200
MORE EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO THE

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:36.470
SORT OF BASIC GRAINS- THEN IN

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:37.971
TERMS OF LIKE THE FOOD SAFETY

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:40.474
ISSUES THAT'S A LOT OF THE FOOD

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.509
PREPARATION. IN DEVELOPING

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:44.478
COUNTRIES IS IN THE INFORMAL

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:45.646
SECTOR IT'S NOT LICENSED IT'S

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.348
NOT. YET IT'S NOT UNDER THE

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:49.316
GOVERNMENT CONTROL. IT'S IN THE

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:51.685
INFORMAL SECTOR AND THERE'S A

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.687
LOT OF THE FOCUS LOT MORE FOCUS

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:55.589
TO WORKING IN THAT SECTOR T.

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.524
EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE DANGERS OF

01:39:57.591 --> 01:40:03.897
FOOD. CONTAMINATION AND TO

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.265
IMPROVE IT. OKAY LET AT THESE

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:07.000
TWO KINDS OF. AND ALSO JUST

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.202
LISTENING TO SOME OF THE

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.237
PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS. I THINK

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:11.805
THE- IN LOOKING AT DROUGHT IN

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.874
THE IMPACTS ON HUMANS IT'S

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.709
IMPORTANT TO KIND OF LOOK AT

01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:16.643
WHICH HUMANS ARE WE TALKING

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.412
ABOUT. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:19.313
PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.647
AGRICULTURE BECAUSE THAT'S

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:22.449
THAT'S A VERY CLEARED DEFINED

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:26.019
GROUP THAT HAS A SET OF. FAIRLY

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.888
CARD THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.289
THERE'S ALSO FARMERS BUT IT

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.157
WOULD BE DIFFERENT A SMALL

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.925
FARMER RECEIVES A LARGE FARMER

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:33.026
AND OF COURSE IN ANY FOOD

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.095
CONSUMER. ANY CONSUMER SAY

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.997
CALIFORNIA FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

01:40:37.064 --> 01:40:39.400
WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN SOME

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.168
WAY BY CALIFORNIA DROUGHT. AND

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:43.937
THEN I THINK ALSO- AND THIS IS

01:40:44.004 --> 01:40:45.539
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.007
QUITE A LOT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.209
THE SHORT RUN SOLUTIONS AND WHAT

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:51.445
ARE THE LONG TERM ONES. AND SO

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:52.479
IN THE SHORT RUN AS THEY

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.881
DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS SIDE

01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:55.949
THAT YOU KNOW THE SAFETY NETS

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.718
LIKE A CASH PAYMENTS FROM

01:40:57.785 --> 01:41:01.188
PAYMENTS. BUT THE LONG TERM ONE

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:05.459
IS. WHAT IS A VIABLE. AND STABLE

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:08.495
ALTERNATIVE FOR DECENT

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:10.030
LIVELIHOODS FOR PEOPLE. AND HOW

01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:12.733
AT N. ALSO SORT OF RECOGNIZING

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.867
TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE CURRENT

01:41:13.934 --> 01:41:16.837
LIVELIHOOD YOU JUST NEED A TIDE

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.839
OVER SO THE NEXT TIME IS TO GET

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.407
TO THE NEXT TIME OR YOU SHOULD

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:22.075
YOU REALLY BE LOOKING FOR CHANGE

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:24.111
A REALLY BIG CHANGE. AND THAT'S

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:25.512
GOES FOR THE FARMERS AS WELL

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:28.215
LIKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT-

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:29.850
BUILDING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS THE

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:30.951
IMPROVING STORAGE IMPROVING

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:33.153
IRRIGATION EFFICIENCY ARE WE

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.688
TALKING ABOUT SOME FARMERS NEED

01:41:34.755 --> 01:41:38.125
GOING OUT OF PRODUCTION. AND SO

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:40.027
. THESE QUESTIONS- YOU HAVE BEEN

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.795
RAISED IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS IN

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.464
AUGUST AND THE ANSWERS ARE

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:44.064
DIFFERENT DEPENDING WHERE YOU

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:48.735
WORK- AND SAME THING ALSO ON THE

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:50.871
CONSUMERS THE SHORT TERM IS THIS

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.372
KIND OF SUBSIDY OR EDUCATION

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:54.575
PROGRAM SO THAT THE LONG TERM

01:41:54.641 --> 01:41:56.844
MAY BE MORE IT. MAJOR CHANGES IN

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.512
FOOD SUPPLY SOURCES IN WHAT THEY

01:41:58.579 --> 01:41:59.746
CALL FOOD ENVIRONMENTS LIKE

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.181
WHERE YOU GET YOUR FOOD

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.850
SUPERMARKETS BUT ALSO

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:05.052
RESTAURANTS AND FOOD STANDS. SO

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:07.354
THERE'S NO NEED TO CONSIDER

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:10.424
WHICH GROUP. OF IMPACT OF PEOPLE

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:11.091
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:12.926
IMPACTS. AND OVER WHAT TIME

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:17.664
FRAME. THE LAST SLIDE- AND JUST

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:19.600
TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE STUFF-

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:21.201
SOMEONE'S MOTIVE IS TALKING

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.369
ABOUT AND ALSO WHAT'S COMING

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:26.340
OUT. OF MORE RECENT DISCUSSIONS

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.108
RELATED TO THAT FOOD SYSTEM SOME

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:28.742
. THE ONE THING THAT'S PRETTY

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:30.844
CLEAR ACROSS ALL THOSE STUDIES

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:32.613
IS EVIDENCE CERTAINLY WAS NOT

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.114
GONNA SURPRISE ANYBODY. THE

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.649
PEOPLE THAT ARE HARDEST HIT ARE

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:36.984
THE MOST VULNERABLE THE PEOPLE

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:39.520
THAT ARE ALREADY IN DEFICIT AS

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:41.488
THE HECK. IT ACT LIKE THEY'RE

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:42.856
LIKE CALIFORNIA AND GROUNDWATER

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.291
GUARDIAN DEFICIT THAT'S WHERE

01:42:44.358 --> 01:42:46.460
THEY TAKE IT EVEN HARDER. SO IN

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:47.794
A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:50.097
AGRICULTURE IN THIS IS GLOBALLY

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:52.332
I MEAN. L. UNDER LOW INCOME

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:54.268
PEOPLE THEY CAN BE MINORITY

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:56.069
PEOPLES AND A LOT OF THEM ARE.

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:58.338
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS THEY'RE NOT

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:01.708
USUALLY LANDOWNERS BUT LET THEIR

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.877
LABORS- ONE ANOTHER COME WITH

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:05.279
CONCERT CLICK CONSISTENTLY IN

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.681
THIS CONTEXT IS. THERE'S A LOT

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:09.516
OF FOCUS ON THE EXPOSED TO LIKE

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.084
THE EMERGENCY RELIEF BRINGING IN

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:13.020
FOOD. AND I THINK THIS WAS ALSO

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:14.922
RAISED AT THE BY THE SENATOR AT

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:17.824
THE BEGINNING OF LIKE WE REALLY

01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:19.626
NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. DOING

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.295
MORE OF THE EX ANTE. THE

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.764
INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCE AND LESS

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.699
OF THE EMERGENCY IS CERTAINLY A

01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:27.734
LOT CHEAPER. TO PREPARE WELLS

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.269
COURSE IS FLOODED IT'S KIND OF

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:30.637
TRICKY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:32.439
FACING A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT-

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:34.875
THIS IS A- PRETTY CLEAR. THING

01:43:34.942 --> 01:43:36.777
THAT IS THE WORST SPENDING WAY

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.779
TOO MUCH ON THAT THE EMERGENCY

01:43:38.845 --> 01:43:43.550
EXPOSED ENOUGH. IN ADVANCE- AND

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:45.352
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:47.287
WITH TRANSFORMATIONAL ADAPTATION

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.122
THOSE LONG TERM CHANGES WHERE

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:50.891
THERE'S RECOGNITION THAT SOME OF

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:52.726
THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING.

01:43:52.793 --> 01:43:55.095
GOING ON A LEASH DAVE ARM IT WAS

01:43:55.162 --> 01:43:57.564
CLIMATE CHANGE WITH POPULATION

01:43:57.631 --> 01:43:59.600
PATTERNS IT REALLY IMPLIES. A

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:03.003
MAJOR MAJOR CHANGE. IS SO FAR

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:04.271
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS MOSTLY

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.839
INCREMENTAL CHANGE PEOPLE SORT

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:07.774
OF STAYING IN THE SAME. OVERALL

01:44:07.841 --> 01:44:10.677
PICTURE ABOUT AGRICULTURE I

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:14.548
MEAN- BUT NOT A MAJOR SHIFT AND

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:15.882
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PUSHING TO

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:18.518
DO THAT BECAUSE- THERE'S A LOT

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.587
OF FEAR THAT IF WE DON'T DO THAT

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:21.955
IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS IS GONNA

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.423
BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:24.958
GONNA BE. IN VERY BAD SHAPE.

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.259
THAT PARTICULAR SUBSAHARAN

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:28.128
AFRICA AND SOUTH ASIA. BUT I

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:30.330
THINK THAT'S RELEVANT IN OTHER

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:33.133
PLACES AS WELL. I DID ALREADY

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.001
MENTIONED THIS THING ABOUT THE

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.602
DECENT JOBS THAT THERE'S MUCH

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:37.904
MORE FOCUSED ON LOOK IN THE OLD

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.740
AGRICULTURAL MODEL AND STILL

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:41.908
THERE'S LIKE THE VIEW OF

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.477
TECHNOLOGY A LOT OF TIMES IS

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:44.911
THAT IT SUBSTITUTES FOR LABOR IT

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.980
REDUCES. THE OVERALL PRODUCTION

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:49.116
COSTS THAT'S GREAT. BUT IT'S NOT

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:50.917
GREAT IF YOU YOU END UP.

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:52.619
GENERATING HUGE BODY OF

01:44:52.686 --> 01:44:54.488
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE PARTICULARLY

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.289
WHEN THEY'RE THE DAY SORT OF

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:57.391
LOVE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN

01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:59.092
SOCIETY. AND THAT THEREFORE

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:02.029
THINKING OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF-

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.230
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN

01:45:03.296 --> 01:45:05.032
PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT.

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:07.300
ENHANCE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY. AND

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.469
THAT COULD. GENERATE DECENT

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:11.505
EMPLOYMENT OVER A LONG TERM. IS

01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:13.040
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS IT'S

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:14.708
A CHANGE FROM HOW THINGS WERE.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:16.877
VIEWED IN THE PAST. AND THERE'S

01:45:16.943 --> 01:45:18.278
A LOT OF WORK GOING IN SOME

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:19.246
MONEY GOING INTO INVESTING IN

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:21.715
THAT. AND THEN A LOT OF FUN IS

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:23.050
THIS GREAT RETHINKING AND

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.384
REDEFINING SUCCESSFUL OR

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:26.053
SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE NOTHING

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:28.021
GOING ON FOREVER. WELL SIMPLY

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:29.089
RESET YOUR REFINING AND

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:30.857
RETHINKING. BUT ONE THING I

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:32.192
THINK IS PROBABLY MOST RELEVANT

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:34.261
IN THE CALIFORNIA CONTEXT IS.

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:36.263
THERE'S REALLY BIG PROBLEMS WHEN

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:39.332
YOU'RE SHORT TERM. SOLUTION

01:45:39.399 --> 01:45:41.835
BLOCKS THE LONG TERM ONE THE

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:43.970
LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE ONE. AND I

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.272
THINK THAT'S COMING UP LIKE YOU

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:47.574
KNOW SUPPORT FOR UNSUSTAINABLE

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:50.310
PRODUCTION METHODS. FOR IS A

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:52.679
PROBLEM IT KEEPS YOU FROM MOVING

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:53.747
TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO I MEAN

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:54.648
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TRANSITION

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:55.916
PERIODS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:56.950
BUT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:58.652
COME UP A LITTLE AND- THAT WAS A

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.120
BIG. ISSUE IN THE DISCUSSIONS

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:02.222
AROUND THAT. ALTHOUGH NOT A LOT

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:03.957
OF SOLUTIONS I WAS STILL IN WHAT

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:09.963
DO YOU DO BECAUSE. THE SHORT

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.797
TERM SOLUTIONS- I SOMETIME IN

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:12.933
THEY ARE. TO IN THEY DO. TO

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:14.301
THERE IS A VERY STRONG URGENCY

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:19.005
TO THOSE KINDS OF. MEASURES SO.

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:20.807
I THINK PART OF THE DISCUSSION

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:21.975
THERE THOUGH IT IS LIKE THIS

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:25.278
LONG TERM IT GET THE LONG TERM.

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:27.714
INVESTMENTS IN PLACE FASTER THAN

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:30.884
WE'RE DOING SO FAR. OKAY AND

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:33.487
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING I

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.856
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND THANK

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:09.055
IMPORTANT AREA DISCUSSION SO I

IN ADDICTION MEDICINE- IN THE

01:47:21.134 --> 01:47:22.202
CENTRAL VALLEY I CURRENTLY

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:23.703
PRACTICE IN BAKERSFIELD

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:26.106
CALIFORNIA. THE HEALTH

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:28.675
IMPLICATIONS OF THE DROUGHT ARE

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:30.744
VERY REAL- THEY ARE VERY

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.345
APPARENT TO THOSE OF US IN THE

01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:33.847
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS WE

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:35.715
WITNESS IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.551
OUR PRACTICES AS THE FIFTH

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:39.452
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE

01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:41.254
NEED TO WAKE UP WE NEED TO WAKE

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:42.823
UP TO THE REALITY OF THE BIGGEST

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:45.926
LACKS OF AXIS OUR PEOPLE SUFFER-

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:47.928
AS A PHYSICIAN I HAVE SPENT MANY

01:47:47.994 --> 01:47:49.930
YEARS WORKING ABROAD. INCREASING

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:51.698
HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO QUOTE ON

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:53.200
QUOTE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:55.569
I HAVE TO SAY. I'VE SEEN VERY

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:57.437
MANY SIMILARITIES OF MY OWN

01:47:57.504 --> 01:48:00.006
COMMUNITY HERE TEN VITAMINS I

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:01.908
HAVE SEEN ABROAD. AND IN MANY

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.777
SITUATIONS MY COMMUNITY

01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:05.579
CONTINUES TO SUFFER THE MOST

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:07.714
DEVASTATING RESULTS OF CHANGES

01:48:07.781 --> 01:48:12.352
THAT ARE. HAPPENING IN MANY MANY

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:13.987
WAYS. THE CDC OR- THAT. THE

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:16.690
DROUGHT IS INCREASING READ. DRAW

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:18.458
IS CAUSING REDUCED STREAM AND

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:19.860
RIVER FLOWS THAT CAN INCREASE

01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:21.394
THE CONCENTRATION OF POLITICS

01:48:21.461 --> 01:48:23.697
AND WATER- AND THEN THE FURTHER

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:25.498
STAGNATION OF WATER AS WELL

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:26.933
HIGHER WATER TEMPERATURES IN

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.501
LAKES AND RESERVOIRS LEADING TO

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:30.804
REDUCED OXYGEN LEVELS THAT CAN

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.672
IMPACT FISH AND OTHER AQUATIC

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:35.041
LIFE IN WATER QUALITY. A RUNOFF

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.810
FROM DROUGHT RELATED WILDFIRES

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:39.479
CAN CARRY EXTRICITY MEN ASKED

01:48:39.546 --> 01:48:42.215
HER GOAL AND WE NEED TO BREED TO

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:43.984
SURFACE WATERS KILLING FISH

01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:46.486
OTHER QUANTIC LIFE BY DECREASING

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:49.356
THE OXYGEN LEVELS IN THE WATER.

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:50.857
MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:52.492
DEPEND ON THE GROUND WATER AS

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:56.596
THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE. OF THE-

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:57.597
WATER AS WELL. SO LET'S GO AHEAD

01:48:57.664 --> 01:48:59.266
AND TALK ABOUT FOOD I THINK

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:00.834
LESLIE DID A GREAT JOB TALKING

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:04.104
ABOUT THAT AS WELL- AND THE- LOT

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.238
OF THE PANELS FOR TALKING ABOUT

01:49:05.305 --> 01:49:06.740
THAT AS WELL THE DRUG COULD

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:08.308
LIMIT GROWTH OF FOOD RESULTING

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.343
IN INCREASED COSTS OF FOOD. AND

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.345
SHORTAGES WHICH WE ARE ALREADY

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.914
EXPERIENCING THE HEALTH

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.882
IMPLICATION OF MALNUTRITION

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:18.285
WHICH WAS ALSO DISCUSSED EARLIER

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:19.819
IS ALREADY BEING WITNESSED IN

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:20.954
CLINICS ACROSS THE CENTRAL

01:49:21.021 --> 01:49:23.290
VALLEY I'M IN ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:25.258
AS WELL- AND IT'S FURTHER BE

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:27.227
EXACERBATED BY DISTRAUGHT WE CAN

01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:29.696
SEE IT IN OUR PATIENTS- IN

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:30.931
ADDITION TO INCREASING ON

01:49:30.997 --> 01:49:33.566
HEALTHY EATING AS WELL. I'LL

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:34.701
LET'S GO AHEAD TALK ABOUT AIR

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:36.803
QUALITY DURING THE DROUGHT THERE

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.138
IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR

01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:39.940
WILDFIRES WHICH WE ALL KNOW AND

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:42.142
DUST STORMS AS WELL I'M LIVING

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.209
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY VALLEY

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:46.479
FEVER IT'S A BIG CONCERN THERE-

01:49:46.546 --> 01:49:48.348
PARTICULATE MATTER SUSPENDED IN

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:49.749
THE AIR FROM THESE EVENTS CAN

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.551
IRRITATE THE BRONCHIAL PASSAGES

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:53.954
OF. AND ONES AND THIS IS LEADING

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.689
TO INCREASED CASES OF CHRONIC

01:49:55.755 --> 01:49:57.357
RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES WHICH WE

01:49:57.424 --> 01:49:59.292
ARE EXPERIENCING AND SEEING AND

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:02.395
WORSENING DAY BY DAY- THE

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:03.897
INCREASED RISK FOR RESPIRATORY

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.565
INFECTIONS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND

01:50:05.632 --> 01:50:07.634
PNEUMONIA AND OF COURSE CODE

01:50:07.701 --> 01:50:09.970
NINETEEN. IS INCREASING AND

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:11.972
BEING EXACERBATED BY OUR DROUGHT

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:15.909
AS WELL- WITH INCREASED DUST AND

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:19.312
DRY CONDITIONS CREATED OTHERS-

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:21.715
JUST CREATING IT'S CREATING A

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.149
EIGHTY ATMOSPHERE FOR MORE

01:50:23.216 --> 01:50:25.285
WILDFIRES AND THE SOMEWHAT KEENE

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:27.220
VALLEY AIR DISTRICT- OUR

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:28.555
RESEARCH TEAMREPORTS THAT AIR

01:50:28.621 --> 01:50:30.457
QUALITY IS BEING MAJORLY

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:33.660
AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES- WHICH IS

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:34.894
FURTHER EXACERBATING CHRONIC.

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.329
OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASES

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:38.198
IN OUR PATIENTS ESPECIALLY IN

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.866
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH IS

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:44.337
WHERE I PRACTICE- AND ESPECIALLY

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:47.574
SOMEONE- AS ME I PERSONALLY

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.176
SUFFER FROM ASTHMA MYSELF- SO I

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:51.644
EXPERIENCE A DAY TO DAY IN

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:52.412
ADDITION TO SEEKING THE

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:59.319
INCREASES IN MY PATIENTS AS-

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:00.120
WELL. DROUGHT BECAUSE THE

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:02.555
INCREASED. OF- PER. AND AIRBORNE

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.057
TALK AS WELL WHICH IS STUDY WELL

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:06.259
AS WELL- THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.560
HAVE SEEN WHENEVER THERE IS A

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:10.263
WATER SHORTAGE- SANITATION AND

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.165
HYGIENE OR CHALLENGE CREATING

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:13.533
MORE DISEASE AND INFECTIONS

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:16.469
SPREAD. INCLUDING HAND WASHING

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:19.239
SO HANDWASHING IS ACTS ACTUALLY

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:21.307
THE MOST EFFECTIVE DETERRENT FOR

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.410
KOBE NINETEEN ASCO NINETEEN IT'S

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:26.046
AN ENVELOPED VIRUS- COMPROMISING

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:28.081
HANDWASHING SPELLS NIGHTMARES

01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:31.985
FOR KOBE NINETEEN ECONOLINE

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:32.786
SALMONELLA SPREAD AS FAR. THE

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.421
SPREAD OF THE DISEASES RAINFALL

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:36.689
DECREASES VERY WELL STUDIED AS

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:39.292
BACTERIA AND VIRUSES CAN POLLUTE

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.995
BOTH- SURFACE OF SURFACE WATER

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:43.663
AND GROUNDWATER FROM STAGNATION

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:45.598
I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ALSO

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:47.767
GONE OVER THIS AS WELL-

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.469
STAGNATION OF WATER CAN ALSO

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:50.970
INCREASE MOSQUITO BREEDING

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:53.206
GROUNDS- WHICH CARRY DISEASES

01:51:53.273 --> 01:51:55.241
LIKE WEST NILE. WHICH IS

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:56.810
SOMETHING THAT IS HUGE IN THE

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.778
CENTRAL VALLEY CASES ARE ALSO

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:01.681
RISING. TO STOCK UP ON VALLEY

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:04.451
FEVER- THE DROUGHT INCREASES

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:07.287
FUNGAL INFECTION SPREAD

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:10.423
INCLUDING- IT SPREADS THE

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:12.625
COXETER MY NKOSI'S FUNGUS

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.994
RESPONSIBLE FOR VALLEY FEVER ON

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:18.264
TOP. OF THE ALREADY RISING CASES

01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:20.500
OF VALLEY FEVER IN OUR VALLEY-

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.969
WE HAD A BLAST I JUST WANTED TO

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:25.472
TOUCH UPON MENTAL HEALTH- THE

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:29.609
PANDEMIC HAS PROVEN- THE IMPACT

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:31.978
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS-

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:33.947
THAT WE ARE IN IS MORE SECURE

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:36.616
THAN WE THOUGHT- THE FINANCIAL

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:39.986
RELATED STRESS THE WORRIES- JUST

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:41.688
WORSENS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.723
WE SEE IT. EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:45.892
IN CLINICS- IN ADDITION TO

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.560
INCREASING ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:50.196
ABUSE AND SADLY INCREASE IN THE

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:52.398
SUICIDE RATE- I AM IN THE

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:53.566
MEDICAL DIRECTOR BUT YOU'RE

01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:55.835
STILL RECOVERY SERVICES AND WE

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:58.638
ARE SEEING IN VERY ALARMING

01:52:58.705 --> 01:53:00.073
INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE AND

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.142
ALCOHOL ABUSE. IN ADDITION TO

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.910
SUICIDE RATE AS WELL HERE IN THE

01:53:03.977 --> 01:53:06.579
CENTRAL VALLEY- MENTAL HEALTH IS

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.848
BEING IMPACTED FROM VERY MANY

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.017
ASPECTS- AND THE DROP IS

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:13.953
DEFINITELY NOT HELPING- AREAS OF

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.656
FOCUS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON-

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:18.758
INCLUDING RESEARCH IS. YOU KNOW

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:20.760
THE DIRECT EFFECT OF THE DROUGHT

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:23.363
ON OUR WORKERS OUT IN THE FARMS

01:53:23.429 --> 01:53:25.798
ON OUR OUTDOOR WORKERS AND THEN

01:53:25.865 --> 01:53:27.834
OF COURSE OUR CHILDREN AS WELL

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:35.074
AS WE HAVEN'T- AS MANY PEOPLE.

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:35.675
HAVE- DESCRIBED BEFORE

01:53:35.742 --> 01:53:37.510
INADEQUATE TO WATER. INTO OF THE

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:39.279
HEALTH OF KIDS- ARMOR AND

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:40.680
LASTING I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:41.948
IS A LOT OF THIS ALSO AFFECTS

01:53:42.015 --> 01:53:45.185
OUR WILDLIFE OF WILDLIFE AND OUR

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:47.754
DEAR USER AND TO OUR LIVESTOCK

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:50.557
THAT WE HAVE- WHAT'S NOT VALLEY

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:52.892
FEVER ALSO AFFECTS ANIMALS AS IT

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:56.095
DOES AFFECT. HUMANS AS WELL SO

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:58.464
WITH THAT THAT WAS ALL I WANTED

TODAY. I AM A HUMAN GEOGRAPHER

01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:36.903
AND I STUDY THE HUMAN DIMENSION

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.004
OF DROUGHT AND HOW IT'S

01:54:38.071 --> 01:54:40.173
IMPACTING PEOPLE'S ON A DAY TO

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.408
DAY BASIS. AND TODAY I WANT TO

01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:44.344
PRESENT ON RESEARCH THAT I

01:54:44.410 --> 01:54:46.346
CONDUCTED IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:51.217
VALLEY DURING THE. 200-012-2000

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:54.754
SIXTEEN DROUGHT. AND AS WELL AS

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:56.489
OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE ADDRESSED

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.925
DROUGHTS ARE REALLY DIFFERENT

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:00.827
THAN OTHER NATURAL HAZARDS.

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:02.428
DESCRIBED AS SLOW MOVING

01:55:02.495 --> 01:55:07.400
HAZARDS. AND SO- SOCIAL ECONOMIC

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:08.635
IMPACTS THAT WE SEE FROM

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:12.171
DROUGHTS HAVE A LONG LAG TIME.

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:13.640
AND THEY OFTEN PRESENT LONG

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:17.176
AFTER THE DROUGHT IS OVER. WE

01:55:17.243 --> 01:55:20.480
HAVE. A HUGE SUITE OF TOOLS AND

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:23.149
INDICATORS THAT MONITOR THE

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:24.784
PHYSICAL IMPACTS OF DROUGHT SO

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:27.353
HOW MUCH WATER THERE IS HOW MUCH

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.789
PRECIPITATION BUT WE REALLY HAVE

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:32.058
A WAYS TO GO AND IDENTIFYING AND

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:34.560
TRACKING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:36.562
IMPACTS OF DROUGHT AND PART OF

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:37.797
THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:40.233
DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE. ONGOING

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:42.368
SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND

01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:46.406
ECONOMIC PROCESS SEES THAT-

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:46.973
IMPACT LIVELIHOODS AND WELL

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:52.945
BEING. AND- FORMER KURDISH HAVE

01:55:53.012 --> 01:55:54.847
REMAINED LARGELY INVISIBLE

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.182
DURING DROUGHT A LOT OF

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:58.051
ATTENTION IT'S PAIN TO THE

01:55:58.117 --> 01:55:59.686
FARMERS THEMSELVES BUT THE

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.721
EXPERIENCE OF OUR WORKERS ARE

01:56:01.788 --> 01:56:05.191
VERY DIFFERENT. A LOT OF THIS.

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.693
HAS TO DO WITH THE UNDOCUMENTED

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:08.995
STATUS OF MANY FARM WORKERS AND

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:11.397
THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO REPORT ON

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:15.501
THEIR EXPERIENCES. AND SO TODAY

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:17.303
I AM PRESENTING ON THE RESEARCH

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:19.205
THAT I CONDUCTED IN THE SN

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:20.006
JOAQUIN VALLEY OVER SEVERAL

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:22.909
YEARS. AND I INTERVIEWED A LOT

01:56:22.975 --> 01:56:26.245
OF FARM WORKERS FARMERS SOCIAL

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:28.448
WORKERS. COMMUNITY BASED

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.750
ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:33.353
AGENCIES WHO ARE WITNESSING THE

01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:35.922
IMPACTS OF THE DROUGHT- I ALSO

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:38.424
CONDUCTED HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS.

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:41.060
INVOLUNTARILY DISTRIBUTION AND

01:56:41.127 --> 01:56:43.396
FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES. AND I

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:45.264
CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE RESEARCH

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:46.399
TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:49.569
DROUGHT UNEMPLOYMENT AND WILL BE

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:51.137
THAT IS HOW IS IT IMPACTING FOOD

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:54.374
SECURITY HOW IS IT IMPACTING

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:57.677
WATER SECURITY AND HEALTH. IN

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:59.879
SOME CONTEXT SOME OF THIS HERE'S

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.647
A QUOTE FROM A NONPROFIT

01:57:01.714 --> 01:57:04.083
DIRECTOR WHO SPENT DECADES IN

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:08.454
THE REGION. STROUT IS A CANCER I

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:09.889
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVEN

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:12.191
MAJOR DISASTER RESPONSES WILL

01:57:12.258 --> 01:57:14.060
FREEZE WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:17.797
IMPACT. WE LOSE THE ORANGES AND

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:19.532
THOUSANDS OUT OF WORK. RIGHT

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:21.901
WITH AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. WE

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:24.904
HAVE A DROUGHT IT IS A SLOW KILL

01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:26.372
EACH YEAR IT IS LIKE A CANCER

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.274
RATHER THAN HEART ATTACK. WE

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.308
HAVE A HEART ATTACK IT IS

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.444
IMMEDIATELY DIAGNOSED WITH

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:33.880
CANCER IT GOES ON KILLING YOU

01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:38.885
UNDETECTED. AND ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:41.421
AREAS THAT. DROUGHT IMPACTS FARM

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:42.822
WORKERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN

DESCRIBED IT AS A CONDITION OF

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:54.066
UNDER EMPLOYMENT. SO FARMERS

01:57:54.133 --> 01:57:55.768
DON'T HAVE ONE JOB THROUGHOUT

01:57:55.835 --> 01:57:57.003
THE YEAR THEY'RE OFTEN TAKING

01:57:57.069 --> 01:58:00.506
VERY SHORT. JOBS ONE AFTER

01:58:00.573 --> 01:58:02.842
ANOTHER SO I AM SO I SPOKE WITH

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:04.510
ONE FARMER CRAIG SHE DESCRIBED

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.312

FIGHTING TO MALES AND IT'S

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:16.088
CONTINUOUS SO WHILE THEY STILL

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:17.824
HAD SOME LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:19.992
DURING THE DROUGHT. OVERALL

01:58:20.059 --> 01:58:22.261
THERE WAS LESS WORK. I AM I

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:24.430
CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN TWO

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.698
DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN TULARE AND

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:28.768
FRESNO COUNTY AND 76% OF THE

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:30.570
PEOPLE SURVEYED SAID THERE WAS

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:33.272
LESS WORK AVAILABLE IN 65%

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:37.677
DECREASED AND THE REPORTED. A

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:38.277
DECREASE IN INCOME DURING THE

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:40.480
DROUGHT. A LOT OF FARMWORKERS

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.647
EXPLAINED IF THEY HAD A TROUBLE

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:43.349
A LOT FARTHER DID YOU FIND WORK

01:58:43.416 --> 01:58:45.318
SO. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN

01:58:45.384 --> 01:58:47.253
COMMUNITIES IN MENDOTA. HEIGHTS

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:50.423
NEAR FRESNO WERE TURNED IN

01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:53.426
DURING THIS TIME WERE TRAVELING

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:54.594
TWO TO THREE HOURS EACH WAY TO

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.330
FIND WORK IN REGIONS LIKE

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:59.332
SALINAS VALLEY. A LOT OF THE

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:00.900
FARM WORKERS ALSO COMPLAINED

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:03.002
ABOUT THE CLOSURE FOR PACKING

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:05.037
PLANTS IS NOT ONLY NECESSARILY.

01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:06.873
WORK BUT ON THE ON THE FARM

01:59:06.939 --> 01:59:10.943
ITSELF ALONG THE- PRODUCTION

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:14.113
PROCESS. IT INTO THE REGION ALSO

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.348
WITNESSED A DECREASE AND

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.283
MIGRATORY WORKERS ARE KIND OF

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.452
TWO CATEGORIES THE FARMWORKERS

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:21.687
THEIR FARM WORKERS WHO LIVE IN

01:59:21.754 --> 01:59:23.556
THE REGION YEAR ROUND. AND THERE

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:24.790
ARE FORMER BECAUSE YOU SPEND A

01:59:24.857 --> 01:59:26.659
LOT OF TIME TRAVELING BETWEEN

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:29.161
WASHINGTON STATE OREGON AND

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:31.764
ARIZONA AND SO DURING THIS TIME

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:33.833
PERIOD THEY JUST SKIPS SEVENTEEN

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.268
VALLEY BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT

01:59:35.334 --> 01:59:37.203
ENOUGH WORK AVAILABLE. AND THIS

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.838
HAD IMPACTS ON LOCAL BUSINESSES

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:42.174
THAT WERE SET UP TO SUPPORT THEM

01:59:42.241 --> 01:59:42.808
DURING THIS TIME PEOPLE TALK TO

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:45.745
ME- ABOUT NORMALLY IT DURING A

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:47.647
CITY LIKE WINDOW THAT. WOULD

01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:49.949
SWELL BY EMAILING NUMBERS BY

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:51.551
THOUSANDS WHEN THESE MIGRATORY

01:59:51.617 --> 01:59:53.219
WORKERS COMMAND A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:57.290
HAVE HOUSING AND- BUSINESSES

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:58.524
THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT THEM

01:59:58.591 --> 02:00:00.927
AND SO THEY HAVE AS BIG IMPACTS

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:06.132
DURING THIS TIME. AND THIS WAS

02:00:06.198 --> 02:00:07.934
ADDRESSED EARLIER AND DOCTOR

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.469
LIPPER'S PRESENTATION. BEING

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:11.737
DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT OF

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:14.206
DROUGHT ON FARM WORKERS HAS TO

02:00:14.273 --> 02:00:17.076
DO WITH THE- LABOR DEMANDS OF

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:19.278
EACH CROP. AND HERE IN THIS

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:22.148
GRAPH WE CAN SEE HOW MANY JOBS

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:26.052
EACH ACRE OF CROPS PROVIDES FOR

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:28.588
FARM WORKERS AND THIS IS THIS IS

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:31.290
THIS IS THIS NUMBER COMES FROM A

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:31.891
STUDY DONE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:33.793
VALLEY. AND SO IT REALLY DEPENDS

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:37.630
WHAT. FARMERS ARE DECIDING TO

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:38.831
NOT PLAN DURING YOUR DURING A

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:41.334
ROUTE THAT IMPACTS FARM WORKERS

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.235
SO IF YOU'RE IN A PASTURE WHICH

02:00:43.302 --> 02:00:44.704
IS ONLY PROVIDED ONE OR TWO JOBS

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:47.707
ON AVERAGE. ARE FOLLOWED IT

02:00:47.773 --> 02:00:49.008
DOESN'T HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:52.845
FARM WORKERS BUT- WHAT WE SEE IS

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.647
THAT DURING THE DROUGHT OFTEN

02:00:54.714 --> 02:00:56.215
THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:59.118
HAVE A HIGH LABOR DEMAND ARE

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:00.620
FOLLOWED. SO THIS WOULD BE THE

02:01:00.686 --> 02:01:02.488
SITE MELONS AND SQUASH AND

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.690
CUCUMBERS AND MELONS PROVIDE ON

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:06.425
AVERAGE IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:01:06.492 --> 02:01:08.294
TWO JOBS PER ACRE FOR FARM

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:12.832
WORKERS- AND- DURING THIS TIME

02:01:12.898 --> 02:01:15.735
WE ALSO SAW THAT FARMERS WERE

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:18.337
BEING ACTUALLY INCREASING. THE

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:20.239
NUMBER OF ALMONDS PISTACHIOS AND

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:22.375
TREATMENTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.410
THEY AREN'T VEN THOUGH THEY DO

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:26.278
REQUIRE MORE WATER. THEY WERE

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:27.780
HAVING HIGHER RETURNS IN THE

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:30.616
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS SO I'M A

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.118
RESERVIST TIMER KIND OF DOUBLE

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:35.988
HIT ONE BECAUSE THERE WAS LESS-

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:38.357
THE DROUGHT LEADING FARMERS TO

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.660
NOT PLANT TOMATOES AND STUFF BUT

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.061
ALSO BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.963
ALMONDS AND PISTACHIOS THERE IS

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:47.066
A DECREASE IN JOBS AVAILABLE FOR

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:56.242
ALL. AND SO HERE'S WELL FROM A-

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:57.843
STAFF MEMBER FROM NONPROFIT YOU

02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:59.545
SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH

02:01:59.612 --> 02:02:02.148
FARMERS. AND SHE TOLD ME MORE

02:02:02.214 --> 02:02:04.116
INFORMATION IS GETTING BACK TO

02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:06.052
US FOR A FARMER WHO COMMUNITIES

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.453
IMPACTS SUCH AS LOWER HOURS AND

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:09.455
SHIELDS WORK CHANGING

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:11.190
SPORADICALLY ACTUALLY GETTING

02:02:11.257 --> 02:02:12.725
THREATS FROM FARMERS SAYING IF

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:16.495
IT DOESN'T RAIN. THEY'RE GOING

02:02:16.562 --> 02:02:17.096
TO LAY OFF OVER THREE HUNDRED

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:21.467
PEOPLE. THE SECOND I MENTIONED

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:22.968
THAT I STUDY DURING THE DROUGHT

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:24.270
HAD TO DO WITH THE IMPACT OF THE

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:27.940
DROUGHT ON. FARMWORKER ENROLL

02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:29.942
RESIDENTS OVERALL WELL BEING.

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:31.711
THE COMBINATION OF UNDER

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:33.713
EMPLOYMENT AND INCREASED

02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:35.748
GROUNDWATER PUMPING DURING THE

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.316
DROUGHT HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES

02:02:37.383 --> 02:02:39.285
ON THE WELL BEING. OF PEOPLE

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:40.286
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO FOOD

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:42.822
AND SECURITY WATER AND SECURITY

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:45.624
AND HEALTH. PEOPLE INTERVIEWED

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.960
REPORTED INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN

FOR UTILITIES AND PAY FOR RENT.

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:55.668
AND THEY ALSO REPORTED. I'M

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:56.235
HAVING JUST LESS FOOD IN THE

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:58.938
HOUSE OVERALL. THE BIGGEST AND

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:00.339
MOST DRAMATIC IMPACT WAS ON

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.775
WATER AND SECURITY. IN RURAL

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:04.176
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE REGION ARE

02:03:04.243 --> 02:03:06.445
DEPENDENT ON DOMESTIC WATER

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.012
WELLS BETWEEN DRY DURING THE

02:03:07.079 --> 02:03:09.749
DROUGHT. AND IN THE MEDIA THIS

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:11.450
IS- THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTS

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:13.352
OF A COMMUNITY SUPPORTER BELT

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:16.756
WHERE MANY OF THE HOUSES WENT

02:03:16.822 --> 02:03:17.356
FOR YEARS WITHOUT ANY RUNNING

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:20.092
WATER. AT FRESNO COUNTY THERE

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:21.994
WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY.

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:24.163
WELLS REPORTED DRY INTO LARRY

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.030
COUNTY IT'S JUST OVER TWO

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:28.701
THOUSAND. BUT AS THIS IS VASTLY

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:30.469
UNDER REPORTED. BECAUSE MANY

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:32.271
RURAL RESIDENTS ARE HESITANT TO

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.773
REPORT FOR FEAR OF BEING

02:03:33.839 --> 02:03:36.208
DEPORTED. FOR BEING EVICTED BY

THEIR LANDLORDS OR FOR HAVING

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.645
THEIR TAKEN CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:43.415
BY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES FOR

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:43.949
LIVING IN A HOUSE WITHOUT

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.885
RUNNING WATER. PEOPLE ALSO

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:48.087
TALKED ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ON

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:50.089
WATER QUALITY. SOME OF THE

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.490
FAMILIES I SPOKE WITH HAD

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.892
STOPPED DRINKING THEIR WATER

02:03:52.958 --> 02:03:53.959
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT SMELLED

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:56.462
AND TASTED. AND A LOT OF REPORTS

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:58.998
AND STUDIES THAT ANALYZE THE WAY

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:00.766
THE DROUGHT IMPACTS WATER

02:04:00.833 --> 02:04:05.905
QUALITY OVERALL. AND MANY OF THE

02:04:05.971 --> 02:04:07.273
FARM WORKERS AND RURAL RESIDENTS

02:04:07.339 --> 02:04:10.409
ALSO SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THE WAYS

02:04:10.476 --> 02:04:12.244
CHALLENGE AND RESPECTED HEALTH.

PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY COULD

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.648
NO LONGER AFFORD HEALTH CARE AND

02:04:15.714 --> 02:04:17.550
THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BY

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.685
CRITICAL MEDICINES. IN COPING

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:21.687
WITH DRY WELLS WAS INCREDIBLY

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:24.456
DIFFICULT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE AND

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:24.990
PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC HEALTH

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:27.893
PROBLEMS. I SPOKE WITH ONE WOMAN

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.463
WHO IS PART OF L. WHO HAD BEEN

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:32.097
UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:34.733
CANCER. AND SHE'S GOING TO

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.203
CHEMOTHERAPY. INCREDIBLY

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:38.404
DIFFICULT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.039
HAVE RUNNING WATER AT HOME IT'S

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:42.107
JUST SO YOU KNOW ABOUT GROWING

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:43.776
UP IN MEXICO WHERE SHE DIDN'T

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:45.010
HAVE RUNNING WATER BUT SHE MOVED

02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:46.512
TO THE U. S. AND THOUGHT THIS

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:49.014
WAS SOMETHING SHE HAD. SHE WOULD

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:58.257
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE AGAIN. SORRY

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.426
THIS IS ANOTHER WOMAN WHO LIVED

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:02.294
IN PORTERVILLE AND WENT THREE

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:04.496
YEARS WITHOUT WATER. AND SHE

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.498
SAYS FOR THIS TRIAL I HAD TO

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.634
HUMBLE MYSELF MY HUSBAND HAD A

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:10.836
STROKE AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:12.738
FOR US TO LIFT THE WATER JUGS.

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:14.106
WE CANNOT USE OUR LAUNDRY

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.074
MACHINE AND HAD TO GO TO A

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.476
LAUNDROMAT. I LOST A LOT OF

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:18.777
WEIGHT FROM THE STRESS OF THE

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:20.679
STRAP I WOULD FLUSH THE TOILETS

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:22.815
WITH RAIN WATER. I READ IT IS

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.149
LEGAL TO CATCH THAT RAIN WATER

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:26.385
BUT I WOULD SECRETLY DO IT THIS

POINTS- HERE THE WATER JUGS ARE

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:36.028
BEING DISTRIBUTED TO COMMUNITY

02:05:36.095 --> 02:05:37.529
MEMBERS AND THE WIDER CARDS SO

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:38.364
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THESE PUNCH

EXPLAINED. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:22.241
THEY BRING THIS FOOD BUT WE WANT

02:06:22.308 --> 02:06:24.243
MORE WORK TO GET MORE FIT TO GET

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.861
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:45.664
FROM MY RESEARCH. DROUGHT RELIEF

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:47.566
REQUIRES CLEAR COORDINATION

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:48.867

02:06:50.302 --> 02:06:53.505
EXPERTISE. IT'S NOT. DROUGHT

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:54.873
WASN'T JUST ABOUT LABOR AND IT

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.442
WASN'T JUST ABOUT WATER AND IT

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:58.410
WASN'T JUST ABOUT HELP. IT IS

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:00.579
ALL THOSE THINGS COMBINED. AT A

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.815
LAPTOP TONIGHT SPOKE WITH SOCIAL

THERE'S ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.496
MORE DIVERSE VOICES IN WATER

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.998
MANAGEMENT DROUGHT PLANNING NOT

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:20.532

PLACES BUT- THE STATE WIDE. THE

02:07:45.657 --> 02:07:47.793
CALIFORNIA'S FOR CLIMATE CHANGE

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:48.427
ASSESSMENT IS THE SOURCE OF ALL

YOU'RE FOR DOCTOR LIPPER I. YOU

KNOW ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:12.651
ABILITY TO GROW FOOD WILL BE

02:08:12.718 --> 02:08:14.486
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DUE TO

02:08:14.553 --> 02:08:17.189
CLIMATE CHANGE- WHAT IS A DROP

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:20.359
IN CALIFORNIA MEAN FOR A FOOD

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:29.134
SECURITY GLOBALLY. WELL THAT'S

02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.236
NOT IT THAT'S NOT A QUESTION TO

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:36.575
ANSWER. BUT THE- CALIFORNIA IS A

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:39.044
MAJOR SUPPLIER I HAVE IT PRETTY

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.746
GOOD THESE NUTRIENT DENSE FOODS

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:42.114
THAT ARE NOW BEING REALLY

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.817
HIGHLIGHTED AS IMPORTANT FOR

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:48.954
FOOD SECURITY. SO IT THE

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:51.156
IMPLICATIONS AND IT DEPENDS A

02:08:51.223 --> 02:08:53.292
LOT ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH OTHER

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:54.560
PRODUCERS AT FIRST WELL DEPENDS

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:56.061
A LOT ON WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:59.398
BUT ITS OWN PRODUCTION HOUSE HOW

02:08:59.465 --> 02:09:00.032
IS CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION GET IT

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:04.036
CHANGED. IN THIS CONTEXT THIS.

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:05.404
AT THE END OF THE CONTEXT OF

02:09:05.471 --> 02:09:06.405
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO OTHER

02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:10.509
GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CHANGE. AND

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:11.910
IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:13.145
REDUCTION FROM CALIFORNIA

02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:15.380
SOURCES ARE THERE ALTERNATIVE

02:09:15.447 --> 02:09:17.816
SOURCES OF SUPPLY. AS THAT

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:21.186
THERE'S SOME ANALYSIS LOOKING AT

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:23.322
YES THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES BUT-

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:25.057
I'VE NOT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.625
BUT JUST POSSIBILITIES OF NEW

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:28.393
AREAS COMING INTO PRODUCTION

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:30.162
WITH DIFFERENT KINDS O CROPS.

02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:31.730
BUT ALSO SOME OF THE CONDITIONS

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:32.865
OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT I THINK

02:09:32.931 --> 02:09:34.566
SOME OF THE OTHER EXPERTS LATER

02:09:34.633 --> 02:09:35.434
ON MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:38.270
IT. YEAH THESE ARE BIG BIG

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:39.571
CHANGES SO LIKE THE INCREASED

02:09:39.638 --> 02:09:42.474
INCIDENCE OF EXTREME EVENTS IS

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:43.909
CHANGING IT FOR EVERYBODY EVEN

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:47.713
IF YOUR CONDITIONS. OF PERHAPS A

02:09:47.779 --> 02:09:48.180
LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:50.616
CALIFORNIA. BILL THE IT'S- IT'S

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:52.951
NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT YOU WHAT

02:09:53.018 --> 02:09:54.219
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:56.755
AND IT'S STILL ABLE TO DO. IS

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:57.222
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:09:57.289 --> 02:10:00.659
SUBSTITUTED IF IT. TURNS OUT

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:03.128
THAT THAT CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:07.266
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. I I'M NOT

02:10:07.332 --> 02:10:09.134
AN EXPERT IN THE NET AND AREA TO

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:11.170
TELL YOU LIKE WHAT I WHAT ARE

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:12.871
THE MODELS TELLING US ABOUT HOW

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:15.140
HOW FEASIBLE IS IT TO MAINTAIN

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:17.743
CALIFORNIA'S. CURRENT STATE OF

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:21.513
PRODUCTION. BUT I DO THINK A LOT

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.215
OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT IS

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:24.750
WHAT IT IS SUBSTITUTION

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:26.385
POSSIBILITIES YES THERE MAY BE

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:28.387
BUT EVEN THESE ARE GOING TO BE

02:10:28.453 --> 02:10:30.422
HIT BY SOME OF THE SAME I DO IS

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.723
MAYBE NOT THE SAME BUT IT'S

02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.258
GOING TO BE HIT BY PROBLEMS AND

02:10:33.325 --> 02:10:36.795
IT WON'T BE THE SAME LEVEL. AS

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:38.096
WE SAY IN THE PAST AND SO

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:38.830
THEREFORE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:40.098
DISCUSSION ALSO AND ARE WE

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:41.533
LOOKING AT A LONG TERM INCREASE

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.834
IN FOOD PRICES AND WHAT DOES

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.970
THAT MEAN. OVERALL AND THAT'S

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:47.005
THAT'S GOT A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:48.674
FOR POOR PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.175
. AND MY NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:54.680
ABOUT- ACTUALLY FOOD PRICES AND-

02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:58.050
OBVIOUSLY IT'S- PAYING A LIVING

02:10:58.116 --> 02:11:00.185
WAGE AND BEYOND FOR EMPLOYEES

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:02.254
ARE AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES FOR

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:04.556
FARM WORKERS- IS EXTREMELY

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:07.626
IMPORTANT BUT- HOW HOW. DO YOU

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:09.828
HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR THOUGHTS

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:12.231
OR IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN. WITH ALL

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:13.632
THE CHALLENGES THAT CLIMATE

02:11:13.699 --> 02:11:17.169
CHANGE IS PRESENTING ON US- ON

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:18.804
IT HOW DO HOW DO WE BALANCE AT

02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:21.373
ALL IN TERMS OF KEEPING FOOD

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.409
PRICES DOWN BUT- CONTINUING OR

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:25.811
IF NOT IMPROVING ACTUALLY THINK

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:27.145
WE NEED TO IMPROVE WE NEED TO

02:11:27.212 --> 02:11:29.848
IMPROVE ON. PAIN BEYOND THE

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:33.085
EIGHTY EIGHT- LIVING WAGE TO TWO

02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:34.253
FARM WORKERS AND AGRICULTURAL

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:36.922
EMPLOYEES ARE DO YOU HAVE ANY

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:39.191
THOUGHTS OR IDEAS AND- IN THAT

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:42.594
REGARD. I CAN JUST TELL YOU SOME

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:45.330
OF THE DISCUSSIONS AS **** CLICK

02:11:45.397 --> 02:11:47.866
IN THE- FOOD SYSTEM SOME OF BUT

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:50.702
ALSO TO SENIORS WORKING OUT FILE

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:52.537
. AND IT MORE RECENT WORK ALSO

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:55.874
JUST LOOKING ON. THE RETURNS TO

02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:58.243
CAPITAL VERSUS RETURNS TO LABOR

02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:03.081
SO THAT INVESTMENTS CAPITAL IT

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.650
IT IT DID THERE'S DISCUSSION

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:06.518
AROUND MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE A

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:09.855
OF MORE. EQUAL SHARING OF THE

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:12.090
BENEFITS BETWEEN THE INVESTMENT

02:12:12.157 --> 02:12:14.993
CAPITAL AND SAVE X. WHAT EQUITY

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.695
CAPITAL PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:18.997
IN INDUSTRIES IN PARTICULAR

02:12:19.064 --> 02:12:20.365
AGRICULTURE THIS IS BIG

02:12:20.432 --> 02:12:24.536
DISCUSSION. SO HOW TO DO THAT

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:26.772
AND IS ANYBODY DOING IT AND I

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:28.373
DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.042
ANYBODY'S ACTUALLY HAD A

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:33.278
SUCCESSFUL. BUT AT THE HAVE SAID

02:12:33.345 --> 02:12:37.516
DON'T KNOW BUT- IT'S- ONE OF THE

02:12:37.582 --> 02:12:39.351
SORT OF IT VERY BASIC THING THAT

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:40.886
THERE'S BEEN THIS HIGHER RETURN

02:12:40.952 --> 02:12:42.621
TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:12:42.688 --> 02:12:46.158
INVEST. FINANCIAL CAPITAL WHERE

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:47.693
IS THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DOES

02:12:47.759 --> 02:12:49.928
SAY HAVE THE LABORS ARE GETTING

02:12:49.995 --> 02:12:51.196
A LOWER SHARE OF THE BENEFITS

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.698
AND THAT'S CHANGED OVER TIME IT

02:12:52.764 --> 02:12:54.466
USED TO BE HIGHER. THAT THE

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:55.867
THERE WAS A MORE EQUAL SPLIT

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:57.803
BETWEEN LABOR AND CAPITAL. IN

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.805
TERMS OF GETTING THE RETURNS AND

02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:01.340
SO THEREFORE WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:03.775
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH HOW THAT

02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:05.277
WORKED IN THE PAST YOU COULD

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.145
LOOK AT THOSE MODELS AND TRY TO.

02:13:07.212 --> 02:13:09.181
GO BACK USE SOME OF THOSE

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:12.017
TECHNIQUES TO. TO GET A MORE

02:13:12.084 --> 02:13:15.153
EQUITABLE. DIVISION OF THE

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:18.724
RETURNS FROM THINGS LIKE YOU

02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:24.196
KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THANK YOU AND THE OTHER

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:26.932
QUESTION- EITHER PRODUCTIVE

02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:29.835
INTERACTIVE PREEN- AND IN TERMS

02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:32.137
OF WORKING WITH THE GET YOUR

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:34.906
DOES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY

02:13:34.973 --> 02:13:37.442
THE DROUGHT. ANOTHER'S DOCTRINE

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:40.278
PROVIDED A LOT OF EXAMPLES ARE I

02:13:40.345 --> 02:13:44.216
MEAN IT WHAT ELSE WHAT ELSE HAVE

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:44.816
YOU HEARD OR HAVE YOU SEEN IN

02:13:44.883 --> 02:13:47.085
TERMS OF. IT'S NOT JUST THE DROP

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:48.787
IN EXTREME HEAT BECAUSE AS WE

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.188
MENTIONED HE HAS MENTIONED

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:53.125
EARLIER AT. THE DROP THIS DOES

02:13:53.191 --> 02:13:54.059
IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T COME ALONG

02:13:54.126 --> 02:13:57.262
YOU ALSO SEE EXTREME HEAT

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:59.331
EXTREME. TEMPERATURES AND- WHAT

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:00.565
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN

02:14:00.632 --> 02:14:03.635
TERMS OF- THE IMPACTS TO HEALTH

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.937
OR THE WELL BEING OF INDIVIDUALS

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:08.173
THAT. ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THESE

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:15.480
TWO. HE DEFINITELY DID COME UP

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:17.215
IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH FARM

02:14:17.282 --> 02:14:23.255
WORKERS. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY A

02:14:23.321 --> 02:14:24.623
A FARM WORKER CAN STAY IN THE

02:14:24.689 --> 02:14:27.659
FIELD DEPENDING ON- THE

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:29.027
TEMPERATURE AND THEY DID SAY

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:30.429
THEY WOULD GET A CERTAIN NUMBER

02:14:30.495 --> 02:14:32.964
OF BREAKS IF TEMPERATURES FOR.

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:36.668
OVER A HUNDRED AND- THEY'RE

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:37.536
ALLOWED TO WATER BREAKS I THINK

02:14:37.602 --> 02:14:39.504
. THERE IS. A LOT OF WORK BEING

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:40.739
DONE ON THAT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.441
RANGE FOR IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:45.577
YOU KNOW CLIMATE PROJECTIONS ARE

02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:47.813
. W. PROJECTING THAT WE'RE GOING

02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:49.214
TO GET HIGHER TEMPERATURES FOR

02:14:49.281 --> 02:14:51.583
LONG PERIODS OF TIME. ENSURING

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:53.585
THAT A LOT OF FARM WORKERS KNOW

02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:58.056
ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS- DURING THIS

02:14:58.123 --> 02:15:06.465
TIME I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YEAH I JUST I WANT TO TACKLE-

02:15:06.531 --> 02:15:09.067
THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL AS A FEW

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:12.037
OTHERS- YES SO IN IN THE

02:15:12.103 --> 02:15:13.772
PSYCHIATRIC WORLD WE KNOW VERY

02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:16.508
WELL THAT ON CERTAIN MEDICATIONS

02:15:16.575 --> 02:15:18.210
CAN MESS WITH THE AUTO

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:20.645
REGULATION WE HAVE TO EXPERIENCE

02:15:20.712 --> 02:15:22.514
HOW OUR BODY REGULATES THAT

02:15:22.581 --> 02:15:24.883
TEMPERATURE. SO YEAH I KNOW IT'S

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:26.818
A BIG CONCERN BECAUSE WINTER'S

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:29.087
EXTREME HEAT PEOPLE ON CERTAIN

02:15:29.154 --> 02:15:30.655
MEDICATIONS WILL RESPOND TO IT

02:15:30.722 --> 02:15:32.991
DIFFERENTLY THEY MIGHT- ACTUALLY

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:35.026
IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED YEARS FOR

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:36.628
US BUT IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED AND

02:15:36.695 --> 02:15:38.296
FIFTY DEGREES FOR THAT SO-

02:15:38.363 --> 02:15:40.465
THAT'S A REAL IMPLICATION FIRM

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:42.534
ON THE PSYCHIATRIC ASPECT OF

02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:43.802
PATIENTS AND OF COURSE MENTAL

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:47.138
HEALTH- BUT YEAH NO IT'S OF

02:15:47.205 --> 02:15:49.307
EXTREME CONCERN HEAT STROKES-

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:51.510
ARE REAL THEY'RE ON THE RISE. I

02:15:51.576 --> 02:15:53.111
AM AND I REALLY REALLY WORRY

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:55.213
ABOUT OUR ELDERLY POPULATION

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:58.550
BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM- AS YOU

02:15:58.617 --> 02:16:00.118
GROW OLDER YOU DON'T YOU CANNOT

02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:02.053
RETAIN YOUR BODY HEAT AS WELL

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.622
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG BABIES

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:05.857
SPECIALLY AT AT YOUR EXTREME AT

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:07.959
YOUR EXTREME AGES SO YEAH- IT'S

02:16:08.026 --> 02:16:09.194
GONNA DEFINITELY A FACTOR

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:11.062
ELDERLY POPULATION AS WELL AND

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:13.932
IT HAPPENS- IN IN VERY MANY WAYS

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.700
AND WE SEE THAT. IN OUR

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:17.235
HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AS WELL SO

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:22.908
THERE'S A VERY. EXTREME- THE

WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM- THE

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.916
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IS THAT WATER

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:40.051
SHORTAGE IS GOING TO CAUSE A LOT

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:43.655
OF CHANGES AND PROBLEMS MOVING

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:46.391
FORWARD AND SOME OF THOSE ARE

02:17:46.458 --> 02:17:48.660
BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION GROWTH

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:51.930
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CHANGES IN

02:17:51.997 --> 02:17:54.899
CLIMATIC AGING OR DETERIORATING

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:56.835
INFRASTRUCTURE GROUNDWATER

02:17:56.901 --> 02:17:59.104
OVERDRAFT ENDANGERED SPECIES

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:02.974
DECLINES AS WELL AS- FRAGMENTED

02:18:03.041 --> 02:18:07.245
. WATER MANAGEMENT. AND SO THE

CALIFORNIA WATER INSTITUTE AT

02:18:08.647 --> 02:18:10.448
FRESNO STATE BEGAN AND THIS

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:12.684
EFFORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND IT

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:14.486
WAS ACTUALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE

02:18:14.552 --> 02:18:16.354
CALIFORNIA WATER RESILIENT

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:19.324
PORTFOLIO INITIATIVES ARE CENTER

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:21.159
HAD TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

02:18:21.226 --> 02:18:23.361
SESSIONS ON TWO SATURDAYS THAT

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:26.097
INCLUDED URBAN AGRICULTURE

02:18:26.164 --> 02:18:28.233
ENVIRONMENTAL AND DISADVANTAGED

02:18:28.299 --> 02:18:30.568
COMMUNITY ADVOCATES FROM THOSE

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:34.239
SESSIONS THEY MADE. FIVE

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:36.007
RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST

02:18:36.074 --> 02:18:37.909
RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT WE

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:41.479
SHOULD CREATE A SHARED VISION

02:18:41.546 --> 02:18:42.047
FOR WATER IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:45.817
VALLEY. PREPARE A CONCEPTUAL

02:18:45.884 --> 02:18:47.552
LEVEL WATER INVESTMENT PLAN.

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:51.456
THAT INCLUDED THAT SHARED VISION

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:53.391
CREATED AN ORGANIZATIONAL AND

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:55.460
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STRUCTURE

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:58.296
FOR IMPLEMENTING THAT VISION.

02:18:58.363 --> 02:19:00.131
DEVELOPING AND FINANCIAL

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:01.332
STRATEGY TO FUND THE SHARED

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:03.768
VISION AS WELL AS DEVELOP A

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:06.638
PROJECT DELIVERY PLAN. AS LESLIE

02:19:06.705 --> 02:19:09.174
MENTIONED EARLIER- DURING HER

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.942
PRESENTATION ABOUT THE

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.344
AUSTRALIAN DROUGHT STUDY. THERE

02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:16.514
WILL BE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:19.617
INCOME DUE TO WATER SHORTAGES

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:22.020
AND AS- CHRISTINA MENTIONED

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:24.155
THERE WILL ALSO BE IMPACTS TO

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.090
EMPLOYMENT IN THE SANFORD CAME

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:27.192
VALLEY. FROM OUR STUDY WE

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.594
CONCLUDED THAT THERE WILL BE AN

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:33.031
ESTIMATED FARM RECEIPTS DECLINE

02:19:33.098 --> 02:19:35.500
OF ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION

02:19:35.567 --> 02:19:38.303
DUE TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:41.072
WATER SHORTAGES WE HAVE WE WILL

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:43.875
HAVE IF WE DO NOTHING- THE OTHER

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:46.144
IMPACTS THAT IT WILL HAVE

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:48.279
INCLUDE STATE WATER OPERATING

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:50.749
INCOME LOSSES. AS WELL AS STATE

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:54.352
WIDE EMPLOYEE INCOME LOSSES AND

02:19:54.419 --> 02:19:56.354
STATEWIDE EMPLOYEE INCOME LOSSES

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:58.356
AND THIS IS MAINLY DUE TO AS AS

02:19:58.423 --> 02:20:00.125
CHRISTINA MENTIONED EARLIER IT

02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:02.594
IS NOT JUST THE AG JOBS THAT ARE

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.729
AFFECTED BY ALL OF THIS BECAUSE

02:20:04.796 --> 02:20:06.598
THERE ARE SUPPORTING INDUSTRIES

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:09.701
AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT DEPEND ON

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:12.737
THOSE WORKERS SUCH AS STORES

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:14.906
GROCERY STORES AND OTHERS. AND

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:17.308
SO WE ESTIMATE OUR STUDY

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:19.110
ESTIMATED THAT THERE WILL BE A

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:22.113
TOTAL OF STATEWIDE TOTAL LOSSES

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.249
OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND-

02:20:24.315 --> 02:20:28.219
JOBS AGAIN IF WE DO NOTHING TO

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:30.155
CORRECT OR TO IMPROVE THE WATER

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:32.457
SHORTAGE CONDITIONS. AND THIS

02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:34.926
WILL HAVE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:37.595
TAX LOSSES OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:41.699
AND NINETY THREE BECAUSE ALL OF

02:20:41.766 --> 02:20:42.333
THESE EMPLOYEES WILL NOT- WILL

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:45.570
NOT BE. WORKING AND SO- IN

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:48.306
RESPONSE TO SENATOR MILAN DAYS-

02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:50.975
QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW MUCH

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.911
WILL IT COST TO DO SOMETHING.

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:54.746
RACHEL MENTIONED THAT IT WAS AN

02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.614
ESTIMATE OF FOURTEEN BILLION

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:59.017
DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:01.119
CONDUCTED A STUDY AND OUR

02:21:01.186 --> 02:21:03.688
ESTIMATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN WAS

02:21:03.755 --> 02:21:05.957
THAT IT WOULD COST AN ESTIMATED

02:21:06.024 --> 02:21:08.593
SEVEN BILLION FOR A ONE TIME

02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:12.730
WATER INVESTMENT PROGRAM- AS

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:14.365
RACHEL ALSO MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:16.467
WE'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD LATELY

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:18.269
DURING THIS DROUGHT AT EMERGENCY

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:20.405
RESPONSE BUT WE NEED TO STOP

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.473
THINKING OF EMERGENCY HOW TO

02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.409
RESPOND IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:26.711
WE NEED TO START PLANNING NOW TO

02:21:26.778 --> 02:21:29.080
PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. AND SO

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:34.085
OUR STUDY INCLUDED A PLAN FOR.

02:21:34.152 --> 02:21:35.920
FUNDING OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:37.488
IN THE NEXT FORTY YEARS AND

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:39.791
CREATED THESE CHANGES AS WAS

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:41.793
MENTIONED I BELIEVE FROM SEVERAL

02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:44.262
EARLIER THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT

02:21:44.329 --> 02:21:47.765
FIT ALL IT IS NOT JUST NEW

02:21:47.832 --> 02:21:49.801
SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:53.371
IT IS NOT JUST- ONE OR ANOTHER

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:56.407
IT IS A BUFFET OF ITEMS THAT ARE

02:21:56.474 --> 02:21:58.276
NEEDED. AND IT ALL STARTS FROM

02:21:58.343 --> 02:22:00.245
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT WE CA'T

02:22:00.311 --> 02:22:02.447
THINK OF IT AS MANAGING THE

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:04.749
WATER FROM THE RIVER OR FROM THE

02:22:04.816 --> 02:22:06.184
COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO THINK OF

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:09.888
IT. AS THE ENTIRE WATERSHED

02:22:09.954 --> 02:22:11.689
STARTING FROM THE HEADWATERS

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:15.527
FIRES IS CAUSING HIM. PROBLEMS

02:22:15.593 --> 02:22:17.695
WHEN IT RAINS WITH WATER QUALITY

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:19.731
AND JUST DEBRIS THAT IS GOING

02:22:19.797 --> 02:22:20.932
AND THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.467
TO BE TREATED SO IT COSTS MORE

02:22:22.533 --> 02:22:24.702
MONEY TO TREAT THE WATER SO IT

02:22:24.769 --> 02:22:27.338
IS- MAKING CHANGES THAT COME ALL

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:28.873
THE WAY FROM THE HEADWATERS ALL

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:32.377
THE WAY TO THE TOP. AND SO- THAT

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.012
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS NEED

02:22:34.078 --> 02:22:37.515
TO BE AGAIN- WATERSHED AS A

02:22:37.582 --> 02:22:39.284
WHOLE THEY NEED TO INCLUDE

02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:41.286
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOSYSTEM

02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:43.521
RIGHT- RESOURCES AS YOU SEE

02:22:43.588 --> 02:22:47.025
FROM. THE GRAPHIC IT INCLUDES-

02:22:47.091 --> 02:22:50.528
READ. SOME RECHARGE BASINS AND

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:51.362
MULTIPLE AREAS OF THE SAN

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:53.498
JOAQUIN VALLEY IT INCLUDES

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:56.834
SURFACE AND GROUND STORAGE. IT

02:22:56.901 --> 02:23:00.405
INCLUDES NEW AND REFURBISHED

02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:02.740
CONVEYANCE WE- THE FIRST PANEL

02:23:02.807 --> 02:23:06.144
DISCUSSED. POTENTIAL NEW SURFACE

02:23:06.210 --> 02:23:09.981
STORAGE. PERSONALITIES AND SO

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:11.816
WE'RE SAYING THAT IT IS BOTH NEW

02:23:11.883 --> 02:23:14.585
AND EGGS- REPAIRING EXISTING OR

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:16.654
EXPANDING THEM AND STILL FOR

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:18.489
EXAMPLE EXPANDING THAT SELLERS

02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:20.425
RESERVOIR AND THEN POTENTIALLY A

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:24.362
NEW- RESERVOIR SET INCLUDES BOTH

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.331
ALSO WE WILL NEED NEW SURFACE

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.765
SURFACE WATER TREATMENT PLANT

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:30.468
FACILITIES AS WELL AS WASTEWATER

02:23:30.535 --> 02:23:32.236
TREATMENT FACILITIES IN MULTIPLE

02:23:32.303 --> 02:23:35.206
AREAS SO AGAIN IT IS NOT A ONE

02:23:35.273 --> 02:23:38.009
SIZE FITS ALL. AND IT IS NOT

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.944
JUST NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IT

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:43.047
IS IMPROVING AND OUR EXISTING

02:23:43.114 --> 02:23:45.450
INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU SEE FROM

02:23:45.516 --> 02:23:49.153
THE GRAPHIC ALSO THERE ARE- THE

02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:50.688
EXCLAMATION MARKS ARE WHERE

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:53.191
THERE IS DAMAGE TO OUR CANALS

02:23:53.257 --> 02:23:56.594
DUE TO SUBSIDENCE SO OUR PLAN

02:23:56.661 --> 02:23:58.830
AND OUR ESTIMATE ALSO INCLUDES.

02:23:58.896 --> 02:24:00.631
MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES SO

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:03.768
THAT THOSE CANALS CAN TRANSPORT

02:24:03.835 --> 02:24:04.268
THE WATER THAT THEY WERE

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:09.607
INTENDED TO. AND SO YOU MIGHT

02:24:09.674 --> 02:24:11.542
ASK WHAT DOES THAT FIVE BILLION

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:15.346
DOLLAR INCLUDES SO IT INCLUDES

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:16.547
THAT THAT SORRY THE SEVEN

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:18.082
BILLION OUT OF THAT SEVEN

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:19.684
BILLION FIVE BILLION WOULD GO TO

02:24:19.751 --> 02:24:21.486
A LOT OF DEBT. INFRASTRUCTURE

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.988
ELEMENTS GROUNDWATER FACILITIES

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:26.324
RECOVERY FACILITIES SURFACE

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:28.993
DRINKING WATER FACILITIES CANALS

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.396
AND THEN THE REST WOULD INCLUDE

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:33.564
THE TRADITIONAL EXPENSES THAT GO

02:24:33.631 --> 02:24:36.034
WITH CONSTRUCTION SUCH AS LAND

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.469
ACQUISITION FACILITY PLANNING

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.805
DESIGNING SEEKER AND SO ON. AND

02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:42.407
ALSO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

02:24:42.473 --> 02:24:44.542
THESE ARE TWO THOUSAND NINE

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:47.545
NUMBERS AND- I'VE BEEN HEARING

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:50.648
THAT THIS IS MORE EQUIVALENT TO

02:24:50.715 --> 02:24:52.283
ABOUT NINE AT THE MOMENT. AND

02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:56.187
SO- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SEVEN

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:58.890
BILLION IS A PRETTY BIG. PRICE

02:24:58.956 --> 02:25:01.059
TAG EVEN IF IT IS A ONE TIME

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:03.094
OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS AND SO

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:05.930
WHAT OUR STUDY CONCLUDED IS THAT

02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:07.732
THE STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:09.901
GOVERNMENTS CANNOT DO IT ALONE

02:25:09.967 --> 02:25:12.336
AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD

02:25:12.403 --> 02:25:16.607
TAKE ALL. OF US WORKING TOGETHER

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:18.676
TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THIS AND

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:22.480
MAKE A AN EFFORT TO DESIGN AND A

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:24.515
PLANET TOGETHER AND COMMUNICATE

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:26.150
WITH EACH OTHER SO WE BELIEVE

02:25:26.217 --> 02:25:28.219
THAT. SOME OF THE MONEY SHOULD

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:30.254
COME FROM THE STATES SOME FROM

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:33.324
THE FEDERAL SOME FROM GREENHOUSE

02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:36.761
REDUCTION FUND- POTENTIAL WATER

02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:40.465
SURCHARGES AS WELL AS- A SPECIAL

02:25:40.531 --> 02:25:45.169
TAX ADD TO THE- TO CALIFORNIA

02:25:45.236 --> 02:25:47.772
AND SO THAT WOULD. MAKE SURE

02:25:47.839 --> 02:25:50.041
THAT LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE ARE

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:52.210
ALL INVOLVED IN IN THIS EFFORT

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:53.911
BUT WE ALSO MUST MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:58.015
IT. TO USE AN ANALOGY OF

02:25:58.082 --> 02:26:00.718
BUILDING A HOME- SO WHEN YOU'RE

02:26:00.785 --> 02:26:03.221
BUILDING A HOME YOU PUT UP A

02:26:03.287 --> 02:26:05.156
WALL AND YOU LEAVE THE SPACE FOR

02:26:05.223 --> 02:26:06.824
IT BUT WHERE YOU KNOW A DOOR

02:26:06.891 --> 02:26:08.392
MIGHT BE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.061
THE FUNDING FOR THAT DOOR AT THE

02:26:10.128 --> 02:26:11.896
MOMENT. YOU'RE PREPARING

02:26:11.963 --> 02:26:14.098
EVERYTHING AROUND ITFOR WHEN

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:16.167
THAT DOOR IS GOING TO BE BUILT

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:18.369
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD NEW

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:20.271
INFRASTRUCTURE REFURBISHED WE

02:26:20.338 --> 02:26:22.673
NEED TO COORDINATE SO WE KNOW

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:25.076
THAT. IN THIS WALL THERE WILL BE

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:27.111
A DOOR SO THAT WE DON'T BUILD A

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:30.181
WALL AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO BACK

02:26:30.248 --> 02:26:31.849
AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE WALL TO

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:34.185
FIT THE DOOR INSTEAD WE'RE

02:26:34.252 --> 02:26:37.755
COORDINATING ALL OF OUR EFFORTS

02:26:37.822 --> 02:26:40.591
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. A HEY

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:43.361
CORD A ONE BIG. EFFORT THAT

02:26:43.427 --> 02:26:45.363
WORKS TOGETHER FOR THE BENEFIT

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:48.900
OF THE ENTIRE WATERSHED. AND SO

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:51.135
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN OR WHAT IS

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:53.271
THE NEXT STEP- SO THE NEXT STEPS

02:26:53.337 --> 02:26:55.907
ARE PHASE ONE WHICH WOULD JUST

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:57.775
INCLUDE PLANNING ORGANIZING AND

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.810
GOVERNANCE AND IT WOULD BEGIN

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.812
WITH CREATING A SHARED VISION

02:27:01.879 --> 02:27:03.648
FOR ST HIKING VALLEY WATER

02:27:03.714 --> 02:27:06.551
MANAGEMENT. FOLLOWED BY. A

02:27:06.617 --> 02:27:09.220
PROJECT FINANCING WHICH COULD

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:11.355
INCLUDE A BALLOT MEASURE AND

02:27:11.422 --> 02:27:12.823
THEN THE PHASE THREE WOULD BE

02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:14.825
THE PROJECT DELIVERY WHICH WOULD

02:27:14.892 --> 02:27:17.161
INCLUDE- INITIATING FACILITY

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.696
PLANNING AND PRELIMINARY

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:21.966
ENGINEERING EFFORTS. AND SO-

02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:25.803
SENSE OUR- INITIAL STUDY WE'VE

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:28.706
THEN. FORMED A GROUP THAT IS

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:30.274
HELPING TO MOVE SOME OF THESE

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:35.246
ITEMS FORWARD THERE ARE SOME-

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.081
EMERGING COLLABORATIONS IN THE

02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:38.916
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SPECIFIC

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:41.819
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT- THIS ONE

02:27:41.886 --> 02:27:44.388
AND SO IT CAME FROM AN EFFORT OR

02:27:44.455 --> 02:27:46.691
A PAPER WRITTEN BY TIM CLAN. AT

02:27:46.757 --> 02:27:48.326
ABOUT WHAT HE LEARNED IN THE

02:27:48.392 --> 02:27:50.328
LAST FORTY YEARS OF WORKING IN

02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:51.963
THE WATER INDUSTRY AND WATER

02:27:52.029 --> 02:27:54.031
POLICY INSTITUTE CONSISTS OF

02:27:54.098 --> 02:27:55.466
SOME OF THE HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:56.601
THAT IT NEEDS TO BE AND

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:58.302
FACILITATED LEADERSHIP THAT

02:27:58.369 --> 02:27:59.837
NEEDS TO HAVE FACILITATED

02:27:59.904 --> 02:28:02.006
LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS BE A

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:05.042
COLLABORATION. AND SO- THERE'S

02:28:05.109 --> 02:28:06.978
AN EMERGING COLLABORATION GOING

02:28:07.044 --> 02:28:09.914
ON AT THE MOMENT AND IT BEGAN

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.816
WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM FRESNO

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:14.418

BEGAN THAT AND ARE CLOSE TO

02:30:10.735 --> 02:30:12.703
BEING DONE WITH THE PHASE ONE

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:14.939
ACTION PLAN WHICH INCLUDES A

02:30:15.005 --> 02:30:16.941
COMMON PROBLEM STATEMENT A

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:18.976
COMMON SOLUTION SET AND IT

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:20.745
FOCUSED ON A COMPREHENSIVE

02:30:20.811 --> 02:30:22.513
INTEGRATED SET OF SOLUTIONS TO

AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER

02:30:46.437 --> 02:30:48.739
THERE'S A DEMAND GAP. THERE'S A

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:51.542
GAP BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY.

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:53.177
THERE HAS BEEN LOST TO

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:55.780
HISTORICAL ECOSYSTEMS HABITATS.

02:30:55.846 --> 02:30:58.416
THERE IS INADEQUATE PHYSICAL AND

02:30:58.482 --> 02:31:00.651
NATE NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

02:31:00.718 --> 02:31:02.586
THERE'S SOME INCONSISTENT LOCAL

02:31:02.653 --> 02:31:04.989
STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES ALL

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:06.657
OF THE CAUCUSES WHICH ARE THE

02:31:06.724 --> 02:31:08.359
STAKEHOLDERS AGREE WITH THE

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:11.328
LEGITIMACY OF THE PROBLEMS FACED

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:13.397
BY THE OTHERS. FROM THE

02:31:13.464 --> 02:31:15.499
DEVELOPING OF THE PROBLEM

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:18.102
STATEMENT THE FIVE CATEGORIES WE

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:21.071
CAME UP WITH FIVE. THE DESIRED

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:24.008
OUTCOMES SO WE WOULD LOVE A SAFE

02:31:24.074 --> 02:31:25.843
DRINKING WATER FOR ALL VALLEY

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.711
RESIDENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER A

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:29.480
SUSTAINABLE WATER SUPPLIES FOR

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.182
FARMS COMMUNITIES ECO AND ECO

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:33.784
SYSTEMS INCREASED FLOOD PLAIN

02:31:33.851 --> 02:31:36.654
ECOSYSTEM HABITATS A SIGNIFICANT

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:38.522
CHANGE IN THE LOOP THE USE OF

02:31:38.589 --> 02:31:40.324
LAND IN THE VALLEY. AND THEN THE

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:42.193
MORE CONSISTENT LOCAL STATE AND

02:31:42.259 --> 02:31:44.595
FEDERAL POLICIES AND TO DEVELOP

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:47.431
A LIST OF SOLUTIONS WE CREATED

02:31:47.498 --> 02:31:50.367
FIVE WORKING GROUPS THAT WERE TO

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:51.735
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE AND

02:31:51.802 --> 02:31:54.305
PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND WE MADE

02:31:54.371 --> 02:31:56.040
SURE THAT EVERY ONE OF THESE

02:31:56.106 --> 02:31:58.943
GROUPS INCLUDED AT LEAST ONE

02:31:59.009 --> 02:32:01.479
FROM ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDER

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:07.518
GROUPS. THE M. THE WORK GROUPS

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:09.653
ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND ACTUALLY

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:11.755
CAME UP WITH MORE THAN NINETY

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:13.757
ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO

02:32:13.824 --> 02:32:15.593
TRANSFORM THE VALLEY FROM

02:32:15.659 --> 02:32:18.095
UNSUSTAINABLE TO SUSTAINABLE

WITH JPL JPL AS ONE OF TEN NASA

02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:18.075
CENTERS. IT'S OWNED BY NASA AND

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:20.244
MANAGED BY CAL TECH. IT'S KNOWN

02:35:20.310 --> 02:35:22.146
AS A FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:24.248
AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER SO- MMHM

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:26.383
OUR MAIN MANDATE IS A ROBOTIC

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:28.218
EXPLORATION SPACE AND THAT ALSO

02:35:28.285 --> 02:35:30.320
APPLIES TO- EARTH OBSERVATIONS

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:32.122
AND TRYING TO HELP. WITH THE

02:35:32.189 --> 02:35:33.857
NATION'S CHALLENGES RISK

02:35:33.924 --> 02:35:35.192
RESPECT- SCIENCE AND

02:35:35.259 --> 02:35:36.927
APPLICATIONS RESEARCHERS THINGS

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:38.729
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. THERE

02:35:38.796 --> 02:35:40.364
ARE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.266
OBJECT ON ANY GIVEN TIME AND ARE

02:35:42.332 --> 02:35:43.701
THE BUSINESS SPACE IS ABOUT TWO

02:35:43.767 --> 02:35:45.803
AND A HALF. BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:46.870
THAT'S A LABORATORY SITTING

02:35:46.937 --> 02:35:49.006
THERE- THANKS TO THE SAN GABRIEL

02:35:49.073 --> 02:35:52.509
MOUNTAINS. IN THE NORTHEAST PART

02:35:52.576 --> 02:35:55.345
OF PASADENA. SO AS I SAID WE DO

02:35:55.412 --> 02:35:56.814
A LOT ON BEHALF OF LOOKING A

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.515
THE EARTH- WE ACTUALLY.

02:35:58.582 --> 02:36:01.351
SUPPLYING MASTER WITH ABOUT HALF

02:36:01.418 --> 02:36:03.153
OF THE SATELLITES THAT ARE USED

02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:05.089
TO OBSERVE THE PLANET- THE OTHER

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:07.725
HALF. MOSTLY PROVIDED BY GODDARD

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:08.625
SPACE FLIGHT INSTITUTE IN

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.994
MARYLAND. AND THIS IS JUST A FEW

02:36:11.061 --> 02:36:12.930
OF THE SNAPSHOTS OF OUR FIRST

02:36:12.996 --> 02:36:15.833
DOING SATELLITES AND QUANTITIES

02:36:15.899 --> 02:36:16.366
THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:18.302
DISCUSSION TODAY. I'M GONNA JUST

02:36:18.368 --> 02:36:20.404
START IN THE UPPER LEFT AND GO

02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:22.106
TO THE RIGHT- THERE ARE A FEW

02:36:22.172 --> 02:36:23.373
REALLY RELEVANT TO THE DROP

02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:24.975
CONSIDERATIONS AND OUR CLIMATE

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:26.510
CHANGE THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE-

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:30.347
YOU KNOW FORCING. FUNCTION THAT

02:36:30.414 --> 02:36:31.715
THAT IS IN. ADDING TO THE

02:36:31.782 --> 02:36:32.783
CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:34.418
UNDERTAKE SO IN THE UPPER LEFT

02:36:34.485 --> 02:36:36.920
IS A GLOBAL PICTURE OF. SURFACE

02:36:36.987 --> 02:36:38.288
AIR TEMPERATURE. WHICH WE KNOW

02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:41.125
HAS BEEN RISING OVER TIME-

02:36:41.191 --> 02:36:43.560
CARBON DIOXIDE IS ONE. THAT WE

02:36:43.627 --> 02:36:45.229
NOW HAVE A VERY NICE

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.764
OBSERVATIONS OF THE GLOBAL

02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:50.334
BURDEN OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THEATMOSPHERE AND HOW IT CHANGES.

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:52.402
HOW IT'S CHANGING WITH TIME. AND

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:53.470
WE ALL KNOW IS INCREASING WITH

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:54.671
TIME BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

02:36:54.738 --> 02:36:56.774
TO THE POINT WHERE FROM SPACE.

02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.442
WE CAN START TO SEEM FAIRLY

02:36:58.509 --> 02:37:00.511
SMALL EMISSION SOURCES. WITHIN

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:02.346
THE STATE WITHIN A CITY. WELL

02:37:02.412 --> 02:37:03.981
ALMOST NARROWING DOWN TO LARGE

02:37:04.047 --> 02:37:05.516
FARMS AND FACTORIES TO TRY AND

02:37:05.582 --> 02:37:06.750
UNDERSTAND THAT'S A MISSION

02:37:06.817 --> 02:37:09.486
THAT'S- WE ACTUALLY. PROTOTYPE

02:37:09.553 --> 02:37:11.388
THROUGH AIRCRAFT- THROUGH

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:13.157
METHANE SURVEYS AND SO FORTH

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:14.124
WITHIN THE STATE THAT WAS VERY

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:15.993
SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT ACTUALLY

02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:17.261
HELPED DEVELOP INTO A PUBLIC

02:37:17.327 --> 02:37:18.929
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO PUT.

02:37:18.996 --> 02:37:21.031
SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS LIKE THAT

02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:23.200
INTO SPACE IN ABOUT A YEAR OR

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:24.868
TWO AND TO HELP MONITOR THE

02:37:24.935 --> 02:37:26.870
EMISSION SOURCES OUT. OF METHANE

02:37:26.937 --> 02:37:28.806
IN THAT CASE. CARBON MONOXIDE IS

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:30.140
ANOTHER POLLUTANT THAT WE KEEP

02:37:30.207 --> 02:37:32.209
TRACK OF SOME SPACE- THE ONE IN

02:37:32.276 --> 02:37:33.377
THE UPPER RIGHT THERE IS THE

02:37:33.443 --> 02:37:34.978
GRAVITY FIELD AND THAT'S GOING

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:35.813
TO COME UP IN A NUMBER OF TIMES

02:37:35.879 --> 02:37:37.381
BECAUSE- IT'S A REALLY USEFUL

02:37:37.447 --> 02:37:39.316
MEASURE TO TRACK WATER. AS IT

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:41.585
MOVES ACROSS THE PLANET- FROM

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:43.787
MELTING ICE SHEETS TO. GROUND

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:44.922
WATER AND SO FORTH AND YOU'RE

02:37:44.988 --> 02:37:46.490
GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT IN IN

02:37:46.557 --> 02:37:47.858
IN THE COMING SLIDES AND THEN

02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:49.693
MARCH PRESENTATION AS WELL. NOW

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:51.061
MOVING DOWN TO THE LOWER LEFT WE

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:52.229
KNOW ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF

02:37:52.296 --> 02:37:53.497
CLIMATE CHANGE'S RISING SEA

02:37:53.564 --> 02:37:55.232
LEVELS. NASA WITH ITS

02:37:55.299 --> 02:37:56.266
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FROM

02:37:56.333 --> 02:37:59.436
FRANCE AND THE EUROPEAN. SPACE

02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:00.704
AGENCY HAS DEVELOPED A LONG

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.606
RECORD OF SPACE BASED SEA LEVEL

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:04.241
MEASUREMENTS THAT HELP US TRACK

02:38:04.308 --> 02:38:08.312
LOCAL. SEA LEVEL RISE. ANOTHER

02:38:08.378 --> 02:38:09.880
CALL REALLY RELEVANT TO THE DISK

02:38:09.947 --> 02:38:11.048
. TODAY AS STORM. WITH BURTON

02:38:11.114 --> 02:38:12.816
SUGGESTS. INSTRUMENTS IN SPACE

02:38:12.883 --> 02:38:14.852
MONITOR SOIL MOISTURE AND HOW IT

02:38:14.918 --> 02:38:16.420
CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO RAINFALL

02:38:16.486 --> 02:38:19.189
OR DROUGHT CONDITIONS. OZONE IS

02:38:19.256 --> 02:38:21.992
INTERESTING IN THE SENSE THAT-

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:25.028
FOR. DECADES AGO WE HELP.

02:38:25.095 --> 02:38:26.930
INSTRUMENTS IN SPACE THAT HELPED

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:28.432
US UNDERSTAND WHY THE OZONE

02:38:28.498 --> 02:38:30.868
HOLE. WAS CREATED. AND THE

02:38:30.934 --> 02:38:32.169
REASON I BRING IT UP HERE IS

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:33.237
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE WAS A

02:38:33.303 --> 02:38:35.038
MONTREAL PROTOCOL SOMETHING PUT

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:36.139
IN PLACE AND THAT'S

02:38:36.206 --> 02:38:37.574
INTERNATIONAL SETTING. TO TRY

02:38:37.641 --> 02:38:38.876
AND REDUCE THE CHEMICALS THAT

02:38:38.942 --> 02:38:40.744
WERE BEING AMENDED TO. TO

02:38:40.811 --> 02:38:42.579
PRODUCE AT ALL AND NOW THESE

02:38:42.646 --> 02:38:43.947
INSTRUMENTS ARE BEING USED TO

02:38:44.014 --> 02:38:45.883
MONITOR THE RECOVERY. AND SO IN

02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:47.784
THE SAME WAY AT SOME POINT WE'LL

02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:49.086
WE'LL KEEP TRACKING. WILL KEEP

02:38:49.152 --> 02:38:51.255
TRACK. OF CARBON WILL PLAY IN

02:38:51.321 --> 02:38:53.156
THE SAME WAY TO HOPEFULLY. YOU

02:38:53.223 --> 02:38:54.057
DON'T FOLLOW THE SORT OF

02:38:54.124 --> 02:38:56.560
MITIGATION- AND REGULATION

02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:58.395
THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA EXACTLY

02:38:58.462 --> 02:39:00.130
LEADING THE WAY IN- AND THEN

02:39:00.197 --> 02:39:01.598
FINALLY THERE'S A- WATER RATE

02:39:01.665 --> 02:39:02.532
REMAINS THERE ON THE RIGHT WHICH

02:39:02.599 --> 02:39:04.368
IS. IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS WAS A

02:39:04.434 --> 02:39:06.303
GREENHOUSE GAS ACTUALLY ALONG

02:39:06.370 --> 02:39:08.105
WITH CARBON DIOXIDE. BUT AS YOU

02:39:08.171 --> 02:39:09.439
KNOW IT'S ALSO THE FUEL FOR MANY

02:39:09.506 --> 02:39:11.141
OF THE STORMS AND RAINFALL. THAT

02:39:11.208 --> 02:39:13.644
WE SEE SO WELL. AND BUSTER WERE

02:39:13.710 --> 02:39:20.284
POURED INTO. OUR ECONOMY AND SO

02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:21.385
FORTH. AND SO I'M I'M ALSO HIT

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:22.519
ON THAT FACT THAT ALL OF NASA'S

02:39:22.586 --> 02:39:24.054
. IS OF TO THE- THE BROADEST

02:39:24.121 --> 02:39:26.757
PART PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL- FOR

02:39:26.823 --> 02:39:28.759
MORE AND IT IS AVAILABLE YOU

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:30.360
KNOW ALL OF THAT FOR SCIENTIFIC

02:39:30.427 --> 02:39:32.195
PURPOSES AND APPLIED SCIENCES

02:39:32.262 --> 02:39:33.497
PURPOSES. BUT THERE ARE MANY

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:34.831
WAYS OF GETTING AT IT FROM A

02:39:34.898 --> 02:39:36.733
MORE LATE PERSPECTIVE. I

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.068
HIGHLIGHT THE WEBSITE UP THERE

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:39.870
AT THE TOP CLIMATE DOT NASA DOT

CHANGE ALSO GET. CERTAIN KINDS

02:39:47.077 --> 02:39:48.478
OF DATA THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU

02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:50.080
IN A FORMAT THAT'S RELEVANT TO

02:39:50.147 --> 02:39:51.648
LOOKING. AT FROM A CLIMATE

02:39:51.715 --> 02:39:54.084
PERSPECTIVE. ON THAT LAST FIGURE

02:39:54.151 --> 02:39:56.820
IS THAT WEBSITE IS SEXY ON AWARD

02:39:56.887 --> 02:39:59.523
WINNING. AWARD WINNING WEBSITE

FOR MANY MANY YEARS. ARE YOU

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:02.092
MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THE WEBBY

02:40:02.159 --> 02:40:04.027
AWARDS IT'S ACTUALLY GARNERED

02:40:04.094 --> 02:40:05.595
THREE OR FOUR WHEN THE AWARDS-

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:06.830
THAT'S A THAT'S A FANTASTIC

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:08.498
SITE. AND AT THE BOTTOM WITH

02:40:08.565 --> 02:40:09.666
THOSE RED ARROWS YOU CAN SEE

02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:12.002
THAT IT IT HAS. A SET OF CLIMATE

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:14.037
VITAL SIGNS FIRST FIND OUT VITAL

02:40:14.104 --> 02:40:15.706
SIGNS FROM. WHAT'S WHAT'S

02:40:15.772 --> 02:40:16.907
HAPPENING WITH THE GLOBAL CARBON

02:40:16.974 --> 02:40:18.976
DIOXIDE BURDEN. THE GLOBAL

02:40:19.042 --> 02:40:20.877
SURFACE TEMPERATURE. HOW WAS THE

02:40:20.944 --> 02:40:23.080
SEA ICE EXTENT CHANGING IN HIGH

02:40:23.146 --> 02:40:25.148
LATITUDES. WHAT'S HAPPENING THE

02:40:25.215 --> 02:40:26.550
ICE SHEETS IN THERE MOSTLY

02:40:26.616 --> 02:40:28.719
BENCH. MELTING AND IN PREVIOUS

02:40:28.785 --> 02:40:30.220
DECADE OR SO AND THEN SO MUCH

02:40:30.287 --> 02:40:32.389
THE C. LEVEL RISE. AND THEN THE

02:40:32.456 --> 02:40:33.223
FIGURE ON THE RIGHT IS TO

02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:35.125
HIGHLIGHT. THAT I DIDN'T GIVEN

02:40:35.192 --> 02:40:38.495
TIME YOU CAN SEE ACTUAL. THE

02:40:38.562 --> 02:40:40.630
LAST COUPLE DAYS OF ALMOST ANY

02:40:40.697 --> 02:40:41.465
OF THOSE PARAMETERS I JUST

02:40:41.531 --> 02:40:42.799
SHOWED YOU ON THAT PREVIOUS

02:40:42.866 --> 02:40:44.434
PAGE. IT'S A- IT'S AN

02:40:44.501 --> 02:40:46.336
APPLICATION CALLED EYES ON EARTH

02:40:46.403 --> 02:40:48.138
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM YOUR-

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:49.740
COMPUTER LAPTOP OR YOU CAN GET

02:40:49.806 --> 02:40:51.942
IT ON YOUR PHONE. AND YOU COULD

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:53.810
LOOK ATFOR EXAMPLE THAT ONE

02:40:53.877 --> 02:40:55.078
IMAGE THERE SHOWS ALL THOSE

02:40:55.145 --> 02:40:56.146
DIFFERENT SATELLITES ORBITING

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:58.648
THE EARTH. YOU CAN PICK ONE N.

02:40:58.715 --> 02:40:59.850
OR OR PARAMETERS LIKE

02:40:59.916 --> 02:41:01.752
TEMPERATURE SEA LEVEL. CARBON

02:41:01.818 --> 02:41:03.553
DIOXIDE AND THEN SEE IT

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:05.288
DISPLAYED AS YOU SEE THERE ON

02:41:05.355 --> 02:41:06.089
THAT COLORFUL IMAGE TO THE

02:41:06.156 --> 02:41:08.091
RIGHT. AND THAT COULD BE VERY

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:10.394
RECENT RIGHT UP TO A GIVEN DATE

02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:11.661
LIKE AS OF YESTERDAY OR THIS

02:41:11.728 --> 02:41:13.296
WEEK. SO THERE'S THAT'S THE

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:14.931
ENTRY POINT OF MAYBE FINDING.

02:41:14.998 --> 02:41:21.405
MORE DATA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE

02:41:21.471 --> 02:41:22.272
GLOBAL GLOBAL VIEWS- EARTH DAY

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:23.607
FROM NASA. AND THIS IS JUST IN

02:41:23.673 --> 02:41:24.274
THE OF WALK THROUGH IT A LITTLE

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:25.175
BIT SO BUT WERE WE'RE ALL WE

02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:25.942
BUSY WORKING ON THE NEXT

02:41:26.009 --> 02:41:27.477
MEASUREMENTS THAT MIGHT GIVE US

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:29.546
GUIDANCE ON BOTH THE SCIENCE AND

02:41:29.613 --> 02:41:30.847
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS

02:41:30.914 --> 02:41:32.349
RESPECT THE EARTH WHICH HAS SOME

02:41:32.416 --> 02:41:34.117
FIDELITY AND SING DOWN AT A

02:41:34.184 --> 02:41:36.219
LEVEL OF CALIFORNIA AND REGIONS

02:41:36.286 --> 02:41:38.121
WITHIN CALIFORNIA EVEN CITIES-

02:41:38.188 --> 02:41:40.190
STARTING ON THE LOWER MIDDLE.

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.725
THAT'S OKAY OUR NEXT LINE SHE'S

02:41:41.792 --> 02:41:43.960
GONNA LUNCHEON IN TWO WEEKS-

02:41:44.027 --> 02:41:46.596
FROM KENNEDY SPACE CENTER IS

02:41:46.663 --> 02:41:48.432
ACTUALLY UP A SET OF SENSORS

02:41:48.498 --> 02:41:50.200
THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE

02:41:50.267 --> 02:41:51.902
AIR FORCE IN THIS CASE IT'S

02:41:51.968 --> 02:41:52.502
GOING TO GO UP TO THE

02:41:52.569 --> 02:41:54.538
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND

02:41:54.604 --> 02:41:56.873
IT WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND AND

02:41:56.940 --> 02:41:58.675
DO BETTER WITH MARINE WEATHER

02:41:58.742 --> 02:41:59.409
AND EXTREME EXTREME WEATHER

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:02.679
THERE- MOVING TO THE LEFT IS A

02:42:02.746 --> 02:42:03.980
SMALL INSTRUMENT THAT'S ALSO

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.148
GOING TO BE PLACED ON THE SPACE

02:42:05.215 --> 02:42:07.851
STATION. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:08.652
UNDERSTAND DUST SOURCES AROUND

02:42:08.718 --> 02:42:11.621
THE PLANET- MAINLY DUST CAN

02:42:11.688 --> 02:42:13.156
INFLUENCE ACTUALLY THE

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:14.558
DEVELOPMENTS LAOS AND IT CAN

02:42:14.624 --> 02:42:16.093
ALSO REFLECT SUNLIGHT BACK TO

02:42:16.159 --> 02:42:17.727
SPACE IT CAN ALSO BE AN ON AIR

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:19.229
QUALITY SOURCE AMERICAN WALLY

02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:23.333
HAZARDS. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:23.967
MACHINE JUST FOR. THAT WAS NEXT

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:25.368
BE ABLE ON THE OR WHAT WE REFER

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:26.937
TO AS FLAGSHIP MISSIONS THEY'RE

02:42:27.003 --> 02:42:28.505
VERY BIG MISSIONS THEY HAVE

02:42:28.572 --> 02:42:29.372
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS I WANT TO

02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:31.541
EMPHASIZE THAT. MUCH OF WHAT WE

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:33.343
DO AND THE SUCCESS OF NASA. IN

02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:35.512
SOMEBODY'S MISSIONS MANAGERS ON

02:42:35.579 --> 02:42:37.581
REALLY SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS

02:42:37.647 --> 02:42:38.415
WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS IN

02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:40.584
THE CASE OF THAT- ITEM CALLED

02:42:40.650 --> 02:42:42.352
SUAT WHICH STANDS FOR SURFACE

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.521
WATER AND OCEAN TOPOGRAPHY. IT'S

02:42:44.588 --> 02:42:46.490
A LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:42:46.556 --> 02:42:48.325
THE FRENCH SPACE AGENCY AND IT'S

02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:51.528
DESIGNED. TO ACTUALLY MEASURE

02:42:51.595 --> 02:42:53.196
FINE SCALE FEATURES OF THE OCEAN

02:42:53.263 --> 02:42:55.165
SURFACE SITES. BUT MORE

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:56.800
PARTICULARLY IT MAKES A HUGE

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:58.034
ADVANCE RELATIVE TO PAST

02:42:58.101 --> 02:43:00.036
MISSIONS LIKE THIS. BECAUSE IT'S

02:43:00.103 --> 02:43:00.871
GOT FINE ENOUGH SKILLS TO

02:43:00.937 --> 02:43:03.673
MONITOR LAKE LEVELS AND RIVER

02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:05.575
LEVELS AND SO AROUND THE GLOBE

02:43:05.642 --> 02:43:07.277
WE CAN WE CAN GET REALLY S.

02:43:07.344 --> 02:43:08.879
FIRST MAJOR OF THE GLOBAL AMOUNT

02:43:08.945 --> 02:43:12.249
OF. WATER AND MEASURE RIVER.

02:43:12.315 --> 02:43:15.218
RIVER BOUND ELEVATIONS AND

02:43:15.285 --> 02:43:19.189
MONITOR SLIDES- IT STARTING IN

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:19.756
TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN IT'S

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:20.891
SLATED TO LAUNCH IT SO WE'RE

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:21.892
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

02:43:21.958 --> 02:43:23.226
SPOT MISSION. CRITICAL BECAUSE

02:43:23.293 --> 02:43:28.698
IT'S GOING TO GET INSIGHTS INTO. LAKES AND RIVERS THAT WE JUST

02:43:28.765 --> 02:43:29.299
HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE. THAT NICER

02:43:29.366 --> 02:43:30.734
MISSION WITH THAT BIG AND- IS

02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:32.769
GOING TO BE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY

02:43:32.836 --> 02:43:34.638
TWENTY THREE IT'S VIBRATION WITH

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:37.440
THE INDIAN SPACE AGENCY- IT HAS

02:43:37.507 --> 02:43:39.309
A LOT OF APPLICABILITY AND

02:43:39.376 --> 02:43:41.278
MARK'S GONNA TALK. QUITE A BIT

02:43:41.344 --> 02:43:44.614
ABOUT WHAT A MISSION LIKE THIS

02:43:44.681 --> 02:43:46.850
CAN DO IN TERMS OF- I THINK FROM

02:43:46.917 --> 02:43:48.752
WHAT. I MEAN THIS NATIONAL HELP

02:43:48.818 --> 02:43:49.986
WITH ALL KINDS OF HAZARDS AND

02:43:50.053 --> 02:43:50.887
THAT'S WHAT'S MARKED AND TALK

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:52.522
ABOUT IT ALSO HELP US MONITOR

02:43:52.589 --> 02:43:54.424
THE ICE SHEETS AND KEEP TRACK OF

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.826
THE AMOUNT OF BIOMASS- WHICH IS

02:43:56.893 --> 02:43:58.228
RELEVANT TO YOU KNOW.

02:43:58.295 --> 02:44:00.263
UNDERSTANDING THE CARBON EMITTED

02:44:00.330 --> 02:44:03.099
AND THE SINK. OF CARBON IN IN

02:44:03.166 --> 02:44:05.168
THE LAND SURFACE SO MARKLE HIT

02:44:05.235 --> 02:44:06.536
ON THAT MORE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:44:06.603 --> 02:44:08.371
THE HAZARDS LIKE SUBSTANCE AND

02:44:08.438 --> 02:44:09.539
THOSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO

02:44:09.606 --> 02:44:12.375
GREAT DROUGHT AND GROUNDWATER

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:13.677
EXTRACTION. MAYA THE MISSION

02:44:13.743 --> 02:44:15.745
THERE IS RELATED IS. IS A REALLY

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:17.314
UNIQUE MISSION CALIFORNIA PLAYS

02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:20.083
A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS-

02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:22.519
MY AS A MISSION TO STUDY. ERA

02:44:22.586 --> 02:44:23.887
SOULS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:25.956
THEIR IMPACT ON AIR QUALITY AND

02:44:26.022 --> 02:44:27.490
THE AND THEN TURN ON PUBLIC

02:44:27.557 --> 02:44:29.226
HEALTH. THE MISSION TEAM IS

02:44:29.292 --> 02:44:31.661
COMPOSED OF BOTH. AIR QUALITY

SCIENCES AND PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:44:34.731 --> 02:44:38.501
SCIENCES AND IT'S GOING TO. IT'S

02:44:38.568 --> 02:44:39.803
DESIGNED TO STUDY THE AIR

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:42.172
QUALITY ON BIRTH OUTCOMES. AND

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:43.707
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS A NUMBER

02:44:43.773 --> 02:44:45.442
OF STATIONS THAT WILL PLAY A

02:44:45.508 --> 02:44:48.411
ROLE IN HELPING HELPING THOSE

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:50.313
TEAMS TAKE TAKE ON THAT SEVEN.

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:51.448
OTHERS ANOTHER MISSION THAT'S A

02:44:51.514 --> 02:44:53.283
VERY KIND OF HIGH AND VERY

02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:55.151
DETAILED SCIENCE QUESTION

02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:56.386
RELATED TO HIGH LATITUDES OF

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:58.221
NIGHT SHOOTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE

02:44:58.288 --> 02:45:00.223
AND THEN THAT LAST ONE. CURRENT

02:45:00.290 --> 02:45:02.225
CONCERNING SEA LEVEL IS JUST THE

02:45:02.292 --> 02:45:05.462
LAST OR THE MOST RECENT ADDITION

02:45:05.528 --> 02:45:07.597
TO THAT LONG STANDING LINE AT

02:45:07.664 --> 02:45:08.999
SEA LEVEL MISSIONS TO HELP US

02:45:09.065 --> 02:45:10.367
MONITOR HOUSE THE LEVEL IS

02:45:10.433 --> 02:45:11.468
CHANGING AROUND THE GLOBE AND

02:45:11.534 --> 02:45:13.603
THAT'S- AGAIN THAT IT'S PART OF

02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:14.437
A VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP

02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:16.940
WITH. FRIGID SPACE AGENCY AND

02:45:17.007 --> 02:45:18.008
THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S

02:45:18.074 --> 02:45:22.812
THAT'S WHAT'S KEEPING. US BUSY A

02:45:22.879 --> 02:45:24.314
LOT AT JPL- IN COULD JUST ON

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:26.950
THIS IS A DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS. A

02:45:27.017 --> 02:45:28.551
SATELLITE OBSERVATION I MENTION

02:45:28.618 --> 02:45:31.087
THAT GRAVITY MISSION- WE REFER

02:45:31.154 --> 02:45:32.255
TO IT AS GRACE AND THEN THE

02:45:32.322 --> 02:45:34.391
FOLLOWING GRACE FOLLOW ON. AND

02:45:34.457 --> 02:45:36.559
IT HELPS US MEASURE AND KEEP

02:45:36.626 --> 02:45:38.361
TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER ON

02:45:38.428 --> 02:45:41.698
WHITE. AND SO IT IT ADDS UP. IT

02:45:41.765 --> 02:45:43.400
IS ABLE TO ADD TOGETHER ALL THE

02:45:43.466 --> 02:45:45.302
GRAMMAR GROUNDWATER SURFACE

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:48.805
WATER AND SNOW PACK AND JUST

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:50.073
GIVE HIM AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT-

02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:51.875
WHAT THE LANDSCAPE HAS IN TERMS

02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:54.144
OF. WATER STORAGE AND THIS IS

02:45:54.210 --> 02:45:56.146
THE TIME SERIES SINCE THE FIRST.

02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:58.281
LAUNCH OF THE FIRST RACE MISSION

02:45:58.348 --> 02:46:00.617
STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND

02:46:00.684 --> 02:46:02.085
BLUE COLORS ARE SHOWING PERIODS

02:46:02.152 --> 02:46:04.587
WHERE THE WATER. THE WATER IS

02:46:04.654 --> 02:46:06.523
SORT OF EXTRA ABOVE NORMAL

02:46:06.589 --> 02:46:08.325
RELATIVE TO THAT TIME PERIOD.

02:46:08.391 --> 02:46:10.593
AND THE RED IS SHOWING SORT OF

02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:13.997
OUR DROUGHT TEN FOLLOWING WHAT-

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:16.132
NICELY AS CINDY AND RACHEL

02:46:16.199 --> 02:46:17.734
PROVIDED SOME BACKGROUND YOU CAN

02:46:17.801 --> 02:46:19.869
SEE WE JUST WENT THROUGH THE

02:46:19.936 --> 02:46:20.470
TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:46:20.537 --> 02:46:21.671
GROUND EVERYTHING TURNED RED.

02:46:21.738 --> 02:46:22.939
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO LAND ON A

02:46:23.006 --> 02:46:26.142
PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT READ PERIOD

02:46:26.209 --> 02:46:27.911
WHICH IS A YOU KNOW A VERY

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:30.513
STRONG DROP AND THE NUMBERS

02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:31.181
THERE IT'S FAIR IN TERMS OF

02:46:31.247 --> 02:46:34.150
MILLIMETERS SO OVER THIS LARGE

02:46:34.217 --> 02:46:35.485
LANDSCAPE. YOU KNOW THESE

02:46:35.552 --> 02:46:36.986
REGIONS ARE JUST DEFICIENT IN

02:46:37.053 --> 02:46:38.021
THE AMOUNT OF WATER THROUGH

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:39.989
THOSE LAYERS UP GROUNDWATER

02:46:40.056 --> 02:46:41.391
SURFACE WATER AND STILL BACKED

02:46:41.458 --> 02:46:43.026
BY THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT A- THIRD

02:46:43.093 --> 02:46:47.063
OF A METER. AND SO MOVING ON ON

02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:49.199
THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS A MORE OF

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:50.433
A CLOSED DOOR GETTING MORE

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:52.969
FOCUSED ON WHAT WE DO RELATIVES

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:54.804
ARE WATER RELATED RESOURCES

02:46:54.871 --> 02:46:57.140
OBSERVATIONS THAT MAY THE BULLS

02:46:57.207 --> 02:46:58.908
HELP US CARRY OUT SCIENCE AND

02:46:58.975 --> 02:47:00.243
UNDERSTAND CLIMATE CHANGE AND

02:47:00.310 --> 02:47:01.511
OTHER THINGS THAT AFFECT

02:47:01.578 --> 02:47:03.012
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF WEATHER

02:47:03.079 --> 02:47:05.115
AND OTHER HAZARDS BUT IT ALSO

02:47:05.181 --> 02:47:07.016
PROVIDES IN MANY CASES

02:47:07.083 --> 02:47:08.952

JUST AND A LOT OF NEPHEW WITH

02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:17.427
THESE. ARE PART AND PARCEL OF

02:47:17.494 --> 02:47:18.795
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'VE HAD

02:47:18.862 --> 02:47:20.497
WITH CALIFORNIA TO ACTUALLY

02:47:20.563 --> 02:47:22.432

DECISION MAKING AGENCIES

02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:30.073
STARTING AT THE UPPER LEFT. WE

02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:32.041
ACTUALLY STUDY- EXTREME STORMS

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:33.276
AND RAIN FALLING ANOTHER

02:47:33.343 --> 02:47:34.677
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS ARE A BIG

02:47:34.744 --> 02:47:36.112
PART OF THAT THAT IMPACT THE

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:38.815
WEST COAST. AND WE- STUDY THOSE

02:47:38.882 --> 02:47:40.717
RIVERS AND HOW THEY'D CHANGE

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:42.786
WITH TIME CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED

02:47:42.852 --> 02:47:45.855
THINGS AND ALSO YOU MENTIONED

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:46.456
BEFORE DELIVERY ARE AND THEIR

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:48.291
FOCUS ON. FORECASTING AND TRYING

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:49.526
TO DO THE MOST ACTUALLY I'VE

02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:52.095
BEEN WORKING WITH JEAN JONES FOR

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:53.129
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND TRYING TO

02:47:53.196 --> 02:47:55.231
IMPROVE. SUB SEASONAL AND

02:47:55.298 --> 02:47:56.633

BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DECISION

02:47:58.635 --> 02:47:59.803
MAKING IT SIR REALLY OUR

02:47:59.869 --> 02:48:02.572
PROBLEM- THERE IN THE MIDDLE IS

02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:04.641
SIERRA SNOWPACK AND WE HAVE

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:09.212
MEASURES OF- BILLY BEANE. YES HI

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:10.814
FIDELITY MEASURES OF SNOW BACK

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.582
YOU KNOW THEY GO OUT BUT HOLD.

02:48:12.649 --> 02:48:13.817
ON A FEW PLACES AND TRYING TO

02:48:13.883 --> 02:48:15.385
ASCERTAIN WHAT THE TOTAL SNOW

02:48:15.452 --> 02:48:18.154
PACK IS OVER A PLACE LIKE THIS-

02:48:18.221 --> 02:48:19.956
TRYING TO REMEMBER THE NAMES

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:22.325
FOLLOWING BASIN- AND WITH SO

02:48:22.392 --> 02:48:23.760
THEY WOULD NORMALLY DO THAT WE

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:24.727
ARE WE NORMALLY ASSESS THE

02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:26.529
AMOUNT OF SNOW IN A REGION LIKE

02:48:26.596 --> 02:48:28.364
THAT THIS BIG WATERSHED BASIN.

02:48:28.431 --> 02:48:30.767
USING UP ALL AND YOU KNOW DOZENS

02:48:30.834 --> 02:48:33.169
OF POINTS THROUGH. REMOTE

02:48:33.236 --> 02:48:35.605
SENSING- BASED ON A ON AN ON AN

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:36.940
AIRCRAFT WE CAN GET IN THE

02:48:37.006 --> 02:48:37.974
SYSTEM AND OF THE ENTIRE

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.642
WATERSHED AND THE AMOUNT OF SNOW

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:40.910
IN THAT WATER SHOULD PRETTY

02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:42.812
PRETTY EFFECTIVELY AND- NASA IS

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:43.913
WORKING HARD ON THE NEXT

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:45.815
SOLICITATION TO TRY AND DEVELOP

02:48:45.882 --> 02:48:50.153
A SPACEBORNE MEASUREMENTS. THAT

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:50.687
WOULD WORK AS EFFECTIVELY

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:51.287
INSTANCE. I'M ON THE RIGHT IS

02:48:51.354 --> 02:48:53.323
THIS CENTRAL GROUND. SHE'S FINE

02:48:53.389 --> 02:48:54.591
I SHOWED YOU THAT IN THE LAST

02:48:54.657 --> 02:48:56.125
ANIMATION SO I WILL GO OVER THAT

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:59.028
DETAIL. THAT BIG RADAR MISSION

02:48:59.095 --> 02:49:00.830
THAT I MENTIONED- NICE EITHER

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:02.398
WHICH IS THE CALIBRATION WITH

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:05.068
THE INDIANS THERE ARE A FEW-

02:49:05.134 --> 02:49:06.769
MEASUREMENTS LIKE THAT IN SPACE

02:49:06.836 --> 02:49:08.438
AND THAT ARE ALSO FLOWN ON

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:11.608
AIRCRAFT. THE MAP ON THE LOWER

02:49:11.674 --> 02:49:15.411
LEFT IS USING DATA LIKE THAT FOR

02:49:15.478 --> 02:49:17.080
HAZARD RESPONSE IN THIS CASE

02:49:17.146 --> 02:49:19.048
IT'S DETECTING WHERE THE SERVICE

02:49:19.115 --> 02:49:21.651
IS FLOODED IN THOSE REGIONS- AND

02:49:21.718 --> 02:49:23.686
THERE'S A RESPONSE PRODUCTS.

02:49:23.753 --> 02:49:24.988
PRODUCED BY SOMETHING WE CALL

02:49:25.054 --> 02:49:27.223
ARIA BUT USED BY CALIFORNIA AND

02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:29.425
OTHER NASH STATE AGENCIES IN THE

02:49:29.492 --> 02:49:31.794
COUNTRY IN THE NATION TO HELP-

02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:33.029
INFORMS LIKE RESPONSE ALL THE

02:49:33.096 --> 02:49:34.898
WAY FROM NOT ONLY FLIGHTS THAT

02:49:34.964 --> 02:49:39.869
FLOODS EARTHQUAKES. FIRES. AND

02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:40.503
SO FORTUNATELY IS IN OTHER PARTS

02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:41.137
OF THE WORLD. IN THE BOTTOM WE

02:49:41.204 --> 02:49:43.673
HAVE A SATELLITE- A SENSOR ON

02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:45.708
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:48.645
THAT IS USED TO MEASURE- PLANT

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:52.148
WATER USE IT. IN SS IS BASED ON

02:49:52.215 --> 02:49:54.717
HOW WARM AND HOT WITH THE PLANTS

02:49:54.784 --> 02:49:56.419
ARE JUST JUST HOW MUCH WATER IT

02:49:56.486 --> 02:49:57.820
NEEDS AND HOW MUCH STRESS IS

02:49:57.887 --> 02:49:59.355
UNDERTAKING AND YOU CAN SEE.

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:01.090
THAT IT HAS A FIDELITY TO ALMOST

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:04.360
SEE FARM LEVEL FARM SIZE LAW.

02:50:04.427 --> 02:50:05.929
AND UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WATER IS

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:07.664
BEING USED FROM A FARMING

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:09.032
PERSPECTIVE WE REFER TO THAT AS

02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:10.700
A BACKWARD TRANSPIRATION IF

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:12.402
YOU'VE HEARD THAT TERM. FINALLY

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:14.370
ON THE RIGHT. IS SOMETHING

02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:16.372
REFERRED TO AS BROWN SUBSTANCE

02:50:16.439 --> 02:50:17.240
YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT WHEN YOU

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.776
EXTRACT GROUNDWATER AND YOU

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.377
EXTRACT ENOUGH OF IT THE GROUND

02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:24.080
CAN ACTUALLY SING. AND THAT'S A

02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:25.515
MEASURE OF SOMEONE THAT SINKING

02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:30.186
IN MARK'S GONNA TALK ABOUT. THAT

02:50:30.253 --> 02:50:30.820
MUCH MORE DETAIL IN THE STOCK.

02:50:30.887 --> 02:50:31.721
SO THIS LAST TIME IT IS JUST A

02:50:31.788 --> 02:50:34.057
HIGHLIGHT THAT- FROM SERVING

02:50:34.123 --> 02:50:36.492
NASCENT AND THAT'S- DETAILS

02:50:36.559 --> 02:50:38.628
PRIMARY MISSION ABOUT 90% OF OUR

02:50:38.695 --> 02:50:40.630
WORK IS DIRECTLY TO DO THAT

02:50:40.697 --> 02:50:42.298
NASSAR RELATED WORK WHETHER IT'S

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:44.233
PLANETARY OR SCIENCE THE SORT OF

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:45.268
THING I'M SHOWING YOU HERE WITH

02:50:45.335 --> 02:50:48.271
THE SATELLITES- ABOUT 10% OF OUR

02:50:48.338 --> 02:50:50.006
WORK IS WITH NON ASSET AGENCIES

02:50:50.073 --> 02:50:51.975
INCLUDING. CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD

02:50:52.041 --> 02:50:53.376
SOME VERY EFFECTIVE

02:50:53.443 --> 02:50:55.945
COLLABORATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA.

02:50:56.012 --> 02:50:56.546
ON THE LEFT THERE IN THE PAST

02:50:56.613 --> 02:51:00.016
AND CURRENT. ACTIVITIES THAT

02:51:00.083 --> 02:51:01.250
HAVE BEEN. REALLY SUCCESSFUL I

02:51:01.317 --> 02:51:02.485
THINK TO A GREAT DEGREE WITH

02:51:02.552 --> 02:51:04.120
CALIFORNIA AGENCIES YOU SEE

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:05.488
THERE ON THE RIGHT THERE'S THAT

02:51:05.555 --> 02:51:07.323
REGIONAL METHANE SURVEY THAT I

02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:08.791
MENTIONED EARLIER- THE

02:51:08.858 --> 02:51:10.660
FORECASTING THAT I ALSO MENTION

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:13.229
IN RELATION TO ATMOSPHERIC

02:51:13.296 --> 02:51:14.230
RIVERS IN SEASONAL DROUGHTS.

02:51:14.297 --> 02:51:16.799
CENTRAL VALLEY SUBSTANCES ON AS

02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:17.367
A PROJECT THAT WAS CONNECTED

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:20.269
WITH. WHEN THE WATER RESOURCES

02:51:20.336 --> 02:51:21.704
THE AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND

02:51:21.771 --> 02:51:23.673
THAT MY AMBITION I TALKED ABOUT

02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:24.674
THAT'S RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH

02:51:24.741 --> 02:51:27.577
OUTCOMES ZERO WATER SNOW PACK

02:51:27.644 --> 02:51:31.547
AND RELATED TO THAT- SUBSTANCES

02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:33.316
LEVY INTEGRITY MONITORING WHICH

02:51:33.383 --> 02:51:34.651
MARK IS GOING TO COVER IN MORE

02:51:34.717 --> 02:51:36.285
DETAIL AND THAT'S THAT THINKS

02:51:36.352 --> 02:51:37.954
THAT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:39.389
TOPIC THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE

02:51:39.455 --> 02:51:40.823
TALKED ABOUT TODAY THAN ABOUT

02:51:40.890 --> 02:51:42.025
FIVE YEARS AGO THEY STIRRED UP

APPLICATIONS OFFICE. TO TRY AND

02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:48.931
INFUSE NASA DATING CAPABILITIES

02:51:48.998 --> 02:51:52.335
MORSE MORE- CHANCE OF LATE INTO

02:51:52.402 --> 02:51:54.270
INTO WESTERN WATER STAKEHOLDERS

02:51:54.337 --> 02:51:56.172
AND DECISION MAKERS HANSON SO

02:51:56.239 --> 02:51:58.408
THAT'S HOW'S THE GPL AND THERE'S

02:51:58.474 --> 02:52:00.009
ALWAYS ACTIVITY IN RELATION TO

02:52:00.076 --> 02:52:01.511
THAT KIND OF A AN APPLIED

02:52:01.577 --> 02:52:03.513
SCIENCE BASIS AND TRYING TO

02:52:03.579 --> 02:52:05.248
BRING DATA. TO DECISION MAKING

02:52:05.314 --> 02:52:06.549
SO WE HAVE THESE LONG STANDING

02:52:06.616 --> 02:52:07.517
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE

02:52:07.583 --> 02:52:08.951
AGENCIES ON THE RIGHT AND I JUST

02:52:09.018 --> 02:52:10.553
ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT SOME

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.221
OF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH AND

02:52:12.288 --> 02:52:13.756
PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT

02:52:13.823 --> 02:52:16.225
GOING FORWARD AT JPL AND

02:52:16.292 --> 02:52:17.660
CALIFORNIA SIGNED A MEMO YOU

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:19.662
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO-

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:21.497
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

02:52:21.564 --> 02:52:23.566
NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. CAL

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:25.835
EPA AND CALIFORNIA FOOD AND

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:27.804
AGRICULTURE AND SO WE'RE TRYING

02:52:27.870 --> 02:52:29.439
TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES AND

02:52:29.505 --> 02:52:30.606
MOVED IN THE FUTURE AND HELP

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:32.041
WITH THE KIND OF PROBLEMS WITH

02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:37.880
FOR TODAY AND WITH THAT I'M.

02:52:37.947 --> 02:52:38.881
GONNA MOVE. ON MARK DO YOU WANT

02:52:38.948 --> 02:52:39.682
TO SHOW YOU SLIDES ARE YOU WANT

02:52:39.749 --> 02:52:44.287
ME TO- I WILL DO IT. OKAY ALL

02:52:44.353 --> 02:52:45.521
AND ALL AT THIS POINT I'LL GO

02:52:45.588 --> 02:52:47.056
AHEADAND INTRODUCE- MARK

SIMMERED PRINCIPAL SCIENTIST

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:51.861
ALSO FROM THE NASA JET

02:52:51.928 --> 02:52:57.433
PROPULSION LABORATORY. WELCOME

02:52:57.500 --> 02:53:04.073
MARK. THANK YOU MY FIRST SLIDE

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:06.576
HERE- WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:07.677
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

02:53:07.744 --> 02:53:11.214
WITH YOU- AND- SO I WILL MAYBE

02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:12.381
GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:53:12.448 --> 02:53:16.519
DETAILS ON OUR WAY TO DOING WHAT

02:53:16.586 --> 02:53:18.321
IS FOR MY COLLEAGUE JUST THE- I

02:53:18.387 --> 02:53:21.691
WENT TO- SOAK. IN IN ADDITION TO

02:53:21.758 --> 02:53:22.892
ALL THAT NOW THEY CAN DO FROM

02:53:22.959 --> 02:53:26.295
SPACE WE CAN ALSO DO THINGS-

02:53:26.362 --> 02:53:28.998
FROM THE AIR MOST OF THE

02:53:29.065 --> 02:53:30.600
SATELLITES AND INSTRUMENTS THAT

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:32.969
YOU SEE. THAT WILL BE LAUNCHED

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.971
TO SPACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS

02:53:35.037 --> 02:53:38.040
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED ON THE

02:53:38.107 --> 02:53:40.276
AIRCRAFT AS WELL AS FOR TESTING

02:53:40.343 --> 02:53:42.512
AND ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR

02:53:42.578 --> 02:53:45.114
STUDYING THE LANDSCAPES AND THE

02:53:45.181 --> 02:53:48.151
WATER. SO SO THE TITLE YOU'RE

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:49.952
TALK IS THE FOLLOWING TO WATER

02:53:50.019 --> 02:53:51.320
SO I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU

02:53:51.387 --> 02:53:53.055
ABOUT THE RESERVATIONS OF. THE

02:53:53.122 --> 02:53:54.957
MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA AND-

02:53:55.024 --> 02:53:57.226
CENTRAL BODY SO I'M A PRINCIPAL

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.195
SCIENTIST ALSO LEAD DOES NOT

02:53:59.262 --> 02:54:01.998
EXIST DELTA X. THE MISSION WHICH

02:54:02.064 --> 02:54:04.400
IS ACTUALLY IN. A CAMPAIGN WITH

02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:08.137
AIRCRAFTS. IN THE MISSISSIPPI

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:09.806
RIVER DELTA. SO A HERE I'M

02:54:09.872 --> 02:54:11.741
SHOWING YO THE PART OF THE

02:54:11.808 --> 02:54:13.209
MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA-

02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:15.912
WEEKENDS FOLLOW. THE LAND LOST

02:54:15.978 --> 02:54:18.014
USING TIME SERIES OF SATELLITES.

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:19.615
THE NEW LET ME MENTION HERE

02:54:19.682 --> 02:54:25.254
SHOWS LOSS OF LAND IN RED SINCE

02:54:25.321 --> 02:54:25.855
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. SO YOU

02:54:25.922 --> 02:54:27.557
CAN SEE THAT SOME PARTS OF THE

02:54:27.623 --> 02:54:29.792
DELTA OR LOSING LAND WHILE

02:54:29.859 --> 02:54:31.527
OTHERS ARE GAINING LAND THAT SO

02:54:31.594 --> 02:54:33.029
THOSE ARE THE ONES IN THE WEST

02:54:33.095 --> 02:54:36.699
THE GREEN PARK. SO IF YOU LOOK

02:54:36.766 --> 02:54:38.401
AT THE LOSS OF LAND IN THIS

02:54:38.467 --> 02:54:42.471
AREA. NO COASTAL LOUISIANA. IT'S

02:54:42.538 --> 02:54:45.541
A QUIVER LAND TO LOSING THAT.

02:54:45.608 --> 02:54:47.710
ONE FOOTBALL FIELD EVERY SINGLE

02:54:47.777 --> 02:54:49.979
HOUR SO THERE'S A LOT OF LAND

02:54:50.046 --> 02:54:52.348
THAT IS BEING LOST IN THAT

02:54:52.415 --> 02:54:53.916
REGION AND THIS IS CERTAINLY

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:55.284
SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT TO

02:54:55.351 --> 02:54:56.919
HAPPEN IN THE SACRAMENTO SAN

02:54:56.986 --> 02:55:03.459
JOAQUIN. DELTA BUT- IN THE

02:55:03.526 --> 02:55:06.229
INTEREST OF- NOW UNDERSTANDING

02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:09.599
THE HOLLIES DEALT US CAN'T KEEP

02:55:09.665 --> 02:55:12.268
UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE- I'M

02:55:12.335 --> 02:55:13.536
GOING TO JUST SHOW YOU THIS

02:55:13.603 --> 02:55:14.904
LITTLE ANIMATION HERE SO THERE

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.305
ARE TWO PERSON SEES BY WHICH

02:55:16.372 --> 02:55:18.174
DEALT US CAN KEEP UP WITH THE

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:19.575
SEA LEVEL RISE SO WE'RE TALKING

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:20.910
HERE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:22.545
DELTAS RIGHT THAT NOT TALKING

02:55:22.612 --> 02:55:24.247
ABOUT THE BAD THAT. SOMEONE CAME

02:55:24.313 --> 02:55:26.682
BY THE END OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA

02:55:26.749 --> 02:55:28.551
SO THERE ARE TWO PROCESSES BY

02:55:28.618 --> 02:55:30.586
WHICH THE KEEP UP WITH C. LEVEL

02:55:30.653 --> 02:55:32.521
RISE THE FIRST ONE IS THROUGH A

02:55:32.588 --> 02:55:34.824
SENTIMENT THAT THE POSITION SO

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:36.659
THE REVERSE COME DOWN FROM THE

02:55:36.726 --> 02:55:38.494
WATERSHED. AND THE DEPOSIT

02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:40.763
SENTIMENTS AT ITS MACH THIS

02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:44.200
BUILDS SOIL AND THAT WE CAN KEEP

02:55:44.267 --> 02:55:46.135
UP WITH SEA LEVEL RISE BUT ON

02:55:46.202 --> 02:55:47.603
THIS MOST OF THE TIME IS NOT

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:49.605
SUFFICIENT. SOME OF THE OTHER A

02:55:49.672 --> 02:55:51.974
PROCESS BY WHICH YOU CAN GAIN

02:55:52.041 --> 02:55:54.110
LAND ELEVATION TO KEEP UP WITH

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:55.912
SEA LEVEL RISE IS THROUGH THE

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:57.780
PLANT AND PRODUCTION SO THE

02:55:57.847 --> 02:56:00.483
PLANTS OF COURSE. GREW THESE

02:56:00.549 --> 02:56:02.852
ROOTS IN THE GROUND- THE- THE

02:56:02.919 --> 02:56:05.221
SENATE SIDE THERE IN THE FALL

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:06.756
THEY DIE AND ALL THIS MATERIAL

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:08.457
ACCUMULATES ON THE GROUND AND

02:56:08.524 --> 02:56:11.093
ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO ELEVATING

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:12.395
THE SOUL AND KEEP UP WITH SEA

02:56:12.461 --> 02:56:14.063
LEVEL RISE SO THESE ARE THE TWO

02:56:14.130 --> 02:56:16.499
PROCESSES BY WHICH A NATURAL.

02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:24.240
ADULT BAG SYSTEM. CAN SURVIVE TO

02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:26.475
ARISE. SO OKAY THE MISSISSIPPI

02:56:26.542 --> 02:56:28.010
RIVER DELTA OF COURSE HAS A LOT

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:30.980
OF WATER- SO THIS MAP HERE-

02:56:31.047 --> 02:56:33.416
WEST'S- NOW GENERATED USING THE

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:35.685
GRACE THAT A SYSTEM WHICH IS THE

02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:37.820
ONE THAT THE- DOING IT

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:40.990
INTRODUCED EARLIER SO. IT

02:56:41.057 --> 02:56:43.459
BASICALLY MEASURES. THE MASS THE

02:56:43.526 --> 02:56:45.127
WEIGHT OF THE WATER AROUND THE

02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:46.829
PLANET AND YOU CAN SEE HERE IN

02:56:46.896 --> 02:56:49.498
BLUE THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA

02:56:49.565 --> 02:56:50.967
AND ITS WATERSHED IS FULL OF

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:52.935
WATER WHICH IS KIND OF.

02:56:53.002 --> 02:56:54.937
CONTRASTING TO WHAT WE FIND OF

02:56:55.004 --> 02:56:57.239
COURSE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE

02:56:57.306 --> 02:57:01.143
ARE LOSING WATER RIGHT BUT THE

02:57:01.210 --> 02:57:03.245
SIMILARITY IN THESE TWO SYSTEMS

02:57:03.312 --> 02:57:07.283
IS THE NEED. FOR THE MANAGEMENT

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:10.252
OF THE WATER RESOURCES RIGHT SO

02:57:10.319 --> 02:57:12.021
WE CAN OBSERVE ALL OF THIS STUFF

02:57:12.088 --> 02:57:14.090
FROM SPACE AND HEAR WHAT I'M

02:57:14.156 --> 02:57:16.525
DISCUSSING OR INTRODUCING TO YOU

02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:20.529
ARE WAYS. TO MAKE INFORMED

02:57:20.596 --> 02:57:24.567
DECISIONS THAT. WITH THE USE OF

02:57:24.633 --> 02:57:26.268
SATELLITE AS WELL AS YOU WERE

02:57:26.335 --> 02:57:31.507
BORN OR AIRCRAFT THE. REMOTE

02:57:31.574 --> 02:57:32.608
SENSING TECHNOLOGIES. SO IT IT

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:34.176
ALSO SHOWED THIS WAS IN A MUCH

02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:36.412
SMALLER IMAGE BUT HERE WE ARE

02:57:36.479 --> 02:57:39.148
SHOWING THE LOSS OF WATER IN THE

02:57:39.215 --> 02:57:42.018
AREAS OF ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. SO

02:57:42.084 --> 02:57:44.687
THE GREEN- GOING TO THE RED

02:57:44.754 --> 02:57:46.856
INDICATES THE LOSS OF WATER SO

02:57:46.922 --> 02:57:48.524
AGAIN THIS IS FROM THE GRACE

02:57:48.591 --> 02:57:51.527
MISSION. SO THE AMOUNT OF WATER

02:57:51.594 --> 02:57:54.030
THAT IS SHOWN HERE AND THAT IS

02:57:54.096 --> 02:57:56.265
BEING LOST THROUGH THE YEARS. IS

02:57:56.332 --> 02:57:58.200
DETECTED FROM THE WEIGHT OF THAT

02:57:58.267 --> 02:58:00.302
WATER SO IT'S A DIFFERENCE IN

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:02.705
GRAVITY. THAT WE'RE MEASURING

02:58:02.772 --> 02:58:05.141
FROM SPACE SO WE CAN DO THIS FOR

02:58:05.207 --> 02:58:06.609
ALMOST THE ENTIRE PLANET AND

02:58:06.675 --> 02:58:08.544
THIS IS THAT YOU WERE SHOWING

02:58:08.611 --> 02:58:10.613
ONLY CALIFORNIA WHICH IS LOSING

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:15.217
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER.

02:58:15.284 --> 02:58:15.785
AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND

02:58:15.851 --> 02:58:20.389
DISSECTING OR. SO I THINK MY

02:58:20.456 --> 02:58:22.324
POSITION IS SLIGHTLY HEAVY SO-

02:58:22.391 --> 02:58:24.060
IT TAKES AWHILE FOR ME TO SWITCH

02:58:24.126 --> 02:58:28.764
THE SIDES- SO. DO YOU KNOW WHEN

02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:30.866
YOU LOSE WATER THERE ARE

02:58:30.933 --> 02:58:34.203
CONSEQUENCES THERE ARE A- IT HAS

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:36.906
IMPACTS ON THE LAND AND- WE CAN

02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:39.608
OBSERVE THAT FROM SPACE AND IT

02:58:39.675 --> 02:58:42.411
WAS ALSO. A NEW DID BY- DOING

02:58:42.478 --> 02:58:43.679
WANT TO SERVE BUT ALSO- YOU'RE

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:46.415
BIASED CINDY MESSER. SO HERE IS

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:48.451
A MAP OF THE LARGE FIGURE THAT

02:58:48.517 --> 02:58:49.752
YOU SEE HERE WITH THE COLORS IS

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:53.722
A MAP OF GROUND SUBSIDENCE. AND

02:58:53.789 --> 02:58:56.258
DE COLORS THAT YOU SEE GO FROM

02:58:56.325 --> 02:58:59.395
ABOUT THE BLUE TO RED WHERE RED

02:58:59.462 --> 02:59:02.331
INDICATES SUBSIDENCE. WITH RATES

02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:04.467
OF ABOUT ALMOST ONE FOOT PER

02:59:04.533 --> 02:59:07.203
YEAR. SO THESE ARE HUGE

02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:09.472
SUBSIDENCE RATES SO THE GROUND

02:59:09.538 --> 02:59:11.740
IS BASICALLY GOING DOWN. SO THE

02:59:11.807 --> 02:59:13.742
HOUSE THAT HAS A REALLY

02:59:13.809 --> 02:59:16.378
SIGNIFICANT REPERCUSSION ON

02:59:16.445 --> 02:59:19.415
INFRASTRUCTURE- LADIES AS WELL

02:59:19.482 --> 02:59:22.618
AS THE BACK WINDOW. IN FACT-

02:59:22.685 --> 02:59:24.353
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE WATER FLOWS

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:27.123
DOWN THE RIVER IT FLOWS DOWN THE

02:59:27.189 --> 02:59:28.891
SLOPES SO IF YOU CHANGE THAT

02:59:28.958 --> 02:59:31.360
SMOKE. YOU WILL ALSO CHANGE THE

02:59:31.427 --> 02:59:32.962
FLOW OF WATER SO IT HAS BEEN

02:59:33.028 --> 02:59:34.864
VERY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES AND

02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:37.166
WE CAN OBSERVE THAT. EXTREMELY

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:40.402
ACCURATELY FROM SPACE AS WELL AS

02:59:40.469 --> 02:59:42.238
WITH OUR SPACE BORNE

02:59:42.304 --> 02:59:45.941
INSTRUMENTS. AND ALSO I JUST

02:59:46.008 --> 02:59:47.877
WANTED TO. YOU USED TO KNOW THAT

02:59:47.943 --> 02:59:49.478
THE DISTRICT KNOWLEDGE HE HAS

02:59:49.545 --> 02:59:53.015
ACTUALLY. BEEN I GUESS ACCEPTED

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:55.518
BY. THAT AND THE CALIFORNIA'S

02:59:55.584 --> 02:59:58.420
GROUNDWATER LIFE THAT- CINDY

02:59:58.487 --> 03:00:00.089
MESSER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

03:00:00.156 --> 03:00:02.992
ACTUALLY HAS A MAP BOTH FROM

03:00:03.058 --> 03:00:06.462
SUBSIDENCE THAT ON IT'S A GREAT

03:00:06.529 --> 03:00:15.938
SITE. SO I DID NOT MENTION SO IT

03:00:16.005 --> 03:00:17.740
HAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE-

03:00:17.806 --> 03:00:19.475
SUBSIDENCE HAS IMPORTANT

03:00:19.542 --> 03:00:22.711
CONSEQUENCES- IN PARTICULAR- I

03:00:22.778 --> 03:00:26.148
QUIT SO HERE WITH OUR INSTRUMENT

03:00:26.215 --> 03:00:27.750
THE U. S. R. WHICH IS INSTALLED

03:00:27.816 --> 03:00:33.189
ON AN AIRPLANE- WE COVERED THE-

03:00:33.255 --> 03:00:34.323
CALIFORNIA I COULD LOOK. SEVERAL

03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:36.358
TIMES AND HERE'S ONE OF THE

03:00:36.425 --> 03:00:38.661
IMAGES THAT WERE RETRIEVED HER

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:40.162
FROM THIS ERA CROPS SHOWING

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:42.765
AGAIN SUBSIDENCE SO BECAUSE IT

03:00:42.831 --> 03:00:45.167
IS AN AIRCRAFT IT'S NOT ONLY GET

03:00:45.234 --> 03:00:46.368
ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE

03:00:46.435 --> 03:00:48.504
HIGHER RESOLUTION DATA. BUT IT'S

03:00:48.571 --> 03:00:51.240
ALSO ON THE MEND- SO YOU WE CAN

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:53.542
FLY AT ANY TIME SO WE DECIDED TO

03:00:53.609 --> 03:00:56.011
LIVE TO BE DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT A

03:00:56.078 --> 03:00:58.314
WHILE OR THE- THE REPEAT OF THE

03:00:58.380 --> 03:01:01.050
MEASUREMENT IT CAN CAN BE FOR US

03:01:01.116 --> 03:01:03.052
A MONTH FOR A YEAR SO WE

03:01:03.118 --> 03:01:05.621
DEMOCRATS IT'S REALLY- WEEKEND

03:01:05.688 --> 03:01:08.257
THAT IT'S ON DEMAND- REMOTE

03:01:08.324 --> 03:01:10.726
SENSING THAT. WE CAN ACHIEVE SO

03:01:10.793 --> 03:01:12.695
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:16.298
SUBSIDENCE MEASUREMENTS- THAT-

03:01:16.365 --> 03:01:20.769
WE- CAPTURED. THIS IS BETWEEN-

03:01:20.836 --> 03:01:22.271
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND TWO

03:01:22.338 --> 03:01:23.339
THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO QUITE AWHILE

03:01:23.405 --> 03:01:26.809
ALREADY. AND THAT IT SHOWS THAT

03:01:26.875 --> 03:01:29.378
ONE OF THESE A SMALLER AREA-

03:01:29.445 --> 03:01:32.047
SMALL AREAS WHICH IS JUST ALONG.

03:01:32.114 --> 03:01:34.483
THE AQUEDUCT. AND YOU CAN SEE

03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:36.385
THAT THE UPWARD UP IN THIS AREA

03:01:36.452 --> 03:01:40.055
IN PARTICULAR IS UNDERGOING-

03:01:40.122 --> 03:01:46.295
SUBSIDENCE RATES. OF NEARLY ONE.

03:01:46.362 --> 03:01:47.196
ONE FOOT IN THAT YEARS SO THIS

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:49.598
IS A- COURTING TO MONITOR

03:01:49.665 --> 03:01:51.767
BECAUSE IN FACT IT WILL IMPACT

03:01:51.834 --> 03:01:54.703
THE SLOPE OF THAT THAT PRODUCT

03:01:54.770 --> 03:01:58.173
AND THEREFORE TO SLOW WATER.

03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:01.644
OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO WITH- OUR

03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:02.578
AIRBORNE REMOTE SENSING

03:02:02.645 --> 03:02:03.912
INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

03:02:03.979 --> 03:02:06.682
SPACEBORNE ONES. IS TO MONITOR

03:02:06.749 --> 03:02:09.285
THE HEALTH OF LADIES THIS IS ONE

03:02:09.351 --> 03:02:11.720
EXAMPLE IN THE SUMMER CAME AND I

03:02:11.787 --> 03:02:13.589
SUBMIT TO SOME WORK IN DELTA.

03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:15.991
AND BC IS THE INSURER ON SHERMAN

03:02:16.058 --> 03:02:19.762
ISLAND SO WE HAVE OBSERVED USING

03:02:19.828 --> 03:02:22.331
THIS UAV SUBSYSTEM AGAIN. BREACH

03:02:22.398 --> 03:02:26.135
IN THE LEVEE- WHICH WAS DETECTED

03:02:26.201 --> 03:02:28.704
DRESSER FROM- DEED TO SUSPECT

03:02:28.771 --> 03:02:30.973
MOTOR G. THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:33.475
PROVIDE- AND AGAIN THIS IS SO

03:02:33.542 --> 03:02:35.978
THIS ONE IS FROM. AN AIRCRAFT

03:02:36.045 --> 03:02:41.016
AND WE CAN. ALSO DO THAT NOT

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:42.951
FROM SPACE. AS WE KNOW SO MANY.

03:02:43.018 --> 03:02:45.688
WE CAN LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE

03:02:45.754 --> 03:02:47.323
LANDSCAPE DON'T IMPACT OF THE

03:02:47.389 --> 03:02:50.326
LOSS OF WATER. UNDERGROUND WATER

03:02:50.392 --> 03:02:51.360
IN ON THE LANDSCAPE BUT WE CAN

03:02:51.427 --> 03:02:54.563
ALSO LOOK AT D. S. STORAGE FOR

03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:58.133
WATER IN OUR- SNOW PACKS AND

03:02:58.200 --> 03:03:00.336
MOUNTAINS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:02.504
EXAMPLES THAT- WE'RE SHOWN BY

03:03:02.571 --> 03:03:04.907
DOING EARLIER. BUT BETWEEN

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:07.443
JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

03:03:07.509 --> 03:03:09.478
AND OF THE JUNE TWO THOUSAND

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:10.446
SEVENTEEN SO THERE WAS NO

03:03:10.512 --> 03:03:12.981
ACTIVITY TO THE POINT FROM. THAT

03:03:13.048 --> 03:03:15.217
ABOUT THIRTY CENTIMETERS OVER

03:03:15.284 --> 03:03:20.089
THE WEEK TO. ABOUT. A METRE OF

03:03:20.155 --> 03:03:21.357
SNOW HERE SO- THIS IS ONE OF-

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:23.092
THE EXAMPLES THAT BE SOMETHING

03:03:23.158 --> 03:03:26.261
THAT WE CAN ALSO DO. WITH

03:03:26.328 --> 03:03:29.898
AIRCRAFT MEASUREMENTS. BUT SOON

03:03:29.965 --> 03:03:32.134
WILL HAVE THREE MISSIONS THAT

03:03:32.201 --> 03:03:34.403
MIGHT BE LAUNCHED- THAT WILL

03:03:34.470 --> 03:03:38.707
FACILITATE MEASUREMENTS OF FLOWS

03:03:38.774 --> 03:03:42.177
OF WATER GLOBALLY AND- WE'RE

03:03:42.244 --> 03:03:44.346
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLY

03:03:44.413 --> 03:03:46.548
THESE SEVEN EWE MEASUREMENTS TO

03:03:46.615 --> 03:03:49.551
CALIFORNIA- WATER RIVER. WATER

03:03:49.618 --> 03:03:52.087
MANAGEMENT SO- SWALLOW THE

03:03:52.154 --> 03:03:53.188
SURFACE WATER AND OCEAN

03:03:53.255 --> 03:03:55.591
TOPOGRAPHY WHICH IS- SHOWN HERE

03:03:55.657 --> 03:03:57.292
AS AN ANIMATION WILL BE LAUNCHED

03:03:57.359 --> 03:03:59.795
NEXT YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

03:03:59.862 --> 03:04:01.597
TWO WOULD PROVIDE. NOT ONLY

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:03.899
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION OF THE

03:04:03.966 --> 03:04:06.301
SEA BUT IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE US

03:04:06.368 --> 03:04:08.404
WITH THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING A

03:04:08.470 --> 03:04:11.907
MEASUREMENT. OF REFURBISHED

03:04:11.974 --> 03:04:15.277
CHARGE. AND ALSO- PROVIDED A

03:04:15.344 --> 03:04:16.512
WEEK TO MONITOR ALL THE

03:04:16.578 --> 03:04:18.847
HYDROLOGY ALONG THE COAST

03:04:18.914 --> 03:04:21.817
ITSELF. AND THE AMOUNT OF WATER

03:04:21.884 --> 03:04:24.987
IN RESERVOIRS AND LAKES SO- DAN

03:04:25.053 --> 03:04:26.989
THIS IS GLOBAL BUT OF COURSE IT

03:04:27.055 --> 03:04:29.525
DEFINITELY WORKS IN CALIFORNIA

03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:30.793
ITS SECOND MISSION HERE WHICH

03:04:30.859 --> 03:04:32.928
WILL BE LAUNCHED IN TWENTY

03:04:32.995 --> 03:04:34.730
TWENTY THREE IS MY SORRY- THAT

03:04:34.797 --> 03:04:37.533
IS THE ONE THAT'S BEING. BUILT

03:04:37.599 --> 03:04:39.301
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INDIAN

03:04:39.368 --> 03:04:41.837
SPACE AGENCY. AND WITH THIS

03:04:41.904 --> 03:04:44.373
MISSION WE WILL BE ABLE TO

03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:48.510
MONITOR THE FLOW OF WATER. UNDER

03:04:48.577 --> 03:04:49.845
THE VEGETATION. SO THIS IS ONE

03:04:49.912 --> 03:04:54.283
OF THE- THE- MEASUREMENTS THAT

03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:57.553
HAS NOT BEEN. EXTENSIVELY USED

03:04:57.619 --> 03:05:00.856
YET NOR FOR SCIENCE OR FOR

03:05:00.923 --> 03:05:02.458
APPLICATIONS FOR THE WATER

03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:04.460
MANAGEMENT SERVICE I SEE A GREAT

03:05:04.526 --> 03:05:06.462
POTENTIAL IN THIS MISSION HERE

03:05:06.528 --> 03:05:10.566
THE- OTHER- THE MEASUREMENT WILL

03:05:10.632 --> 03:05:13.068
THIS MISSION WOULD PROVIDE. IS

03:05:13.135 --> 03:05:15.137
GROUND SUBSIDENCE SO IT WILL BE

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:16.305
ABLE TO PROVIDE GROUND

03:05:16.371 --> 03:05:20.876
SUBSIDENCE AGAIN HOPEFULLY. AND

03:05:20.943 --> 03:05:22.778
THIS ONE WILL PROVIDE US OF

03:05:22.845 --> 03:05:24.112
COURSE AND ALL THE DATA WOULD BE

03:05:24.179 --> 03:05:26.482
FREE AS THE WIND SAID EARLIER

03:05:26.548 --> 03:05:29.351
AND WE PROVIDE RADIUS- YES VERY

03:05:29.418 --> 03:05:31.119
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE

03:05:31.186 --> 03:05:32.554
MANAGEMENT OF OUR WATER

03:05:32.621 --> 03:05:34.389
RESOURCES THE LAST MISSION HERE

03:05:34.456 --> 03:05:37.759
IS B. G. WHICH STANDS FOR SIR

03:05:37.826 --> 03:05:40.262
FIRST BIOLOGY AND GEOLOGY WHICH-

03:05:40.329 --> 03:05:42.564
IS MOST LIKELY A LONG STAY IN

03:05:42.631 --> 03:05:44.099
THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT

03:05:44.166 --> 03:05:45.968
AND MAYBE LATER. AND THIS ONE

03:05:46.034 --> 03:05:47.369
WOULD PROVIDE MEASUREMENTS OF

03:05:47.436 --> 03:05:50.506
WATER QUALITY IN ADDITION TO

03:05:50.572 --> 03:05:55.410
ENABLING- MONITORING. OF THE

03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:56.478
HEALTH OF VEGETATION. SO I WILL

03:05:56.545 --> 03:05:58.313
STOP HERE I WILL LEAVE YOU AND

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:00.482
THIS ANIMATION AND THE- LOOK

03:06:00.549 --> 03:06:07.155
FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. FULL

03:06:07.222 --> 03:06:11.159
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:13.462
PRESENTATION SO I IT JUST. THIS

03:06:13.529 --> 03:06:15.998
IS AN AREA THAT- JUST REALLY I'M

03:06:16.064 --> 03:06:17.332
PERSONALLY REALLY INTERESTED AND

03:06:17.399 --> 03:06:20.135
I THINK THAT IT IS A HUMAN

03:06:20.202 --> 03:06:23.272
SECURITY ISSUE IT'S A- OUR-

03:06:23.338 --> 03:06:26.008
CLEAN WATER ISSUE IT IS A FOOD

03:06:26.074 --> 03:06:27.910
ISSUE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND-

03:06:27.976 --> 03:06:29.411
THE FASCINATED BY THE WORK THEY

03:06:29.478 --> 03:06:32.681
IF IT YOU'RE ALL DOING AND ALSO

03:06:32.748 --> 03:06:34.483
THE WORK THAT. IS THAT YOU.

03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:36.051
LOOKING AHEAD OF US AS WELL IN

03:06:36.118 --> 03:06:38.220
TERMS OF THE WORK THAT- FRESNO

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:40.022
STATE AND THE DIFFERENT

03:06:40.088 --> 03:06:41.823
PARTNERS. COLLABORATORS WITH

03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:43.425
FRESNO STATE AND ALONG WITH AT

03:06:43.492 --> 03:06:48.263
NASA. I- I HAVE IN DISTRICT I

03:06:48.330 --> 03:06:51.667
THINK. NOT TOO MANY QUESTIONS

03:06:51.733 --> 03:06:56.438
BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN AND

03:06:56.505 --> 03:06:57.406
- KIND OF GETTING A LITTLE BIT

03:06:57.472 --> 03:07:01.276
OF A SENSE OF WHAT NASA. IN

03:07:01.343 --> 03:07:03.478
TERMS OF SUBSIDENCE AND IN TERMS

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:05.147
OF LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF

03:07:05.213 --> 03:07:09.318
DELTA'S. WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT

03:07:09.384 --> 03:07:11.887
YOU KNOW. THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

03:07:11.954 --> 03:07:13.255
FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW THAT AROUND

03:07:13.322 --> 03:07:14.690
THE WORLD IN OTHER ARTS OF THE

03:07:14.756 --> 03:07:16.925
US AND CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:19.628
REPORTS ABOUT SUBSIDENCE

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:23.165
OCCURRING. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

03:07:23.231 --> 03:07:26.001
GOING TO BE MORE LOOKING INTO

03:07:26.068 --> 03:07:27.970
THAT ARE AT A GLOBAL SCALE. BUT

03:07:28.036 --> 03:07:29.504
I MEAN WHAT IS IT THAT THAT KIND

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:32.341
AND- WHAT QUESTIONS ARE NOT HAVE

03:07:32.407 --> 03:07:34.309
NOT BEEN ANSWERED YET IN TERMS

03:07:34.376 --> 03:07:37.946
OF SUBSIDENCE IN TERMS OF- THE

03:07:38.013 --> 03:07:40.582
FUTURE OF DELTAS WHAT WHAT. ARE

03:07:40.649 --> 03:07:41.149
WE LOOKING AT WHAT SHOULD WE

03:07:41.216 --> 03:07:49.658
EXPECT. YEAH I DON'T MAYBE I

03:07:49.725 --> 03:07:53.495
START SO I- LAURA MENTIONED THAT

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:54.963
EARLIER WE NEED TO HAVE A

03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:57.432
COORDINATED A WAY OF MANAGING

03:07:57.499 --> 03:08:00.302
THE RESOURCES- THE WATER

03:08:00.369 --> 03:08:03.672
RESOURCES IN THIS CASE. AND-

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:05.374
WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND REALLY

03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:08.443
IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ALL OF

03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:11.146
THE D. DISPOSAL WHICH IS THE

03:08:11.213 --> 03:08:13.015
LANDSCAPE RIGHT SO WE GO FROM

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:16.918
THE UPPER WATERSHED ALL THE WAY.

03:08:16.985 --> 03:08:19.721
TO THE CITY. AND THE WATER GOES

03:08:19.788 --> 03:08:22.290
THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS SEES

03:08:22.357 --> 03:08:24.793
WHICH- ARE DUE TO IT BEING A-

03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:28.296
ACTIVITY OF- HUMAN. AT ALL THE

03:08:28.363 --> 03:08:31.933
WAY TO A GEORGE COLLECTIVITIES-

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:33.535
BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES SO WHEN'S

03:08:33.602 --> 03:08:37.372
THE INTERACTION. OF THE WATER

03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:39.141
WITH THE- LANDSCAPE BASEL BUT I

03:08:39.207 --> 03:08:41.777
THINK WE STILL DON'T FULLY

03:08:41.843 --> 03:08:44.246
UNDERSTAND OR- ACTIVITIES THAT

03:08:44.312 --> 03:08:46.081
QUANTITATIVELY WE HAVEN'T YET

03:08:46.148 --> 03:08:48.750
QUANTIFIED EVERYTHING THERE AND

03:08:48.817 --> 03:08:49.317
I THINK NOW WITH THESE TOOLS

03:08:49.384 --> 03:08:52.721
THAT. YEAH WE HAVE- IT'S

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:56.291
POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS THIS- THIS

03:08:56.358 --> 03:08:59.661
GAP IN KNOLEDGE. BECAUSE NOW WE

03:08:59.728 --> 03:09:01.396
HAVE THIS THIS VERY LARGE SCALE

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:03.498
VIEW- WE USED TO HAVE JUST A

03:09:03.565 --> 03:09:05.567
LITTLE GAUGE A LITTLE WATER

03:09:05.634 --> 03:09:06.802
LEVEL GAUGE HERE ANOTHER ONE

03:09:06.868 --> 03:09:09.271
THERE BUT NOW WE SEE EVERYTHING

03:09:09.337 --> 03:09:11.807
WE SEE THE CONNECTION- ACROSS

03:09:11.873 --> 03:09:13.875
