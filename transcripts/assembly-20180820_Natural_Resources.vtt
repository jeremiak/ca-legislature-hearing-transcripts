THREE OF THE ANALYSIS.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.412 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON DC HAS EMBARKED ON A

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:54.847 region:rollup2
POORLY CRAFTED STRATEGY TO ROLL

NATION COMBATING AUTOMOTIVE

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:05.591 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS VIA BIPARTISAN EFFORTS

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:07.293 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS.

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:08.727 region:rollup2

NATIONAL HIGHWAY.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.411 region:rollup2
AND WILL NOT JUST INCREASE HER

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:26.345 region:rollup2
POLICE MISSIONS BUT WILL COST

00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:29.215 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS MORE.

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:31.851 region:rollup2
THE GAS PUMP.

00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:33.419 region:rollup2

INNOVATION IN THE AUTOMOTIVE

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:43.429 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:45.865 region:rollup2
OUR MODERN CARS PRODUCE FEWER

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:47.666 region:rollup2
ADMISSIONS AND HAVE INCREASED

00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:49.735 region:rollup2
GAS MILEAGE WITHOUT COMPROMISING

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:52.771 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:54.306 region:rollup2
IN FACT MODERN CARS AND TRUCKS

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:56.308 region:rollup2
PRODUCE MORE HORSEPOWER.

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:58.077 region:rollup2
THAN EVER BEFORE WITH LESS

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:59.879 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT AND FUEL

00:22:58.077 --> 00:23:01.880 region:rollup2

STANDARDS.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:12.725 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE A DRASTIC NEGATIVE

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:13.292 region:rollup2

MEMORY AS A FEW WEEKS AGO WE

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:18.324 region:rollup2
BOTH INTRODUCED MEASURES TO

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:20.292 region:rollup2
STAND UP FOR CALIFORNIA GETTING

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:21.794 region:rollup2
TO KEEP ITS WAVER FROM THE CLEAN

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.796 region:rollup2
AIR ACT AND CONTINUE --

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:25.197 region:rollup2
TO SET STANDARDS THAT THEY FELT

00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:26.298 region:rollup2
THAT WE BELIEVE ARE CORRECTED

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:28.033 region:rollup2
DETERMINE OUR OWN FATE AND OUR

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.534 region:rollup2
OWN FUTURE WHEN IT COMES TO FUEL

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.535 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY AND EMISSION

00:24:28.534 --> 00:24:30.803 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:32.338 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:33.505 region:rollup2
OF HOW INSTEAD OF COMPETING WITH

00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:34.840 region:rollup2
ONE ANOTHER WE CAN ACTUALLY COME

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:36.275 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND SET.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.444 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY GOOD POLICY BUT HAVE A

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:39.611 region:rollup2
MUCH STRONGER VOICE BY WORKING

SHE HAS OF MANY OTHER ISSUES

00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:47.052 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:24:45.184 --> 00:24:49.888 region:rollup2
BAD LIKE TO UNDERSCORE A COUPLE

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:50.823 region:rollup2

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:52.558 region:rollup2
AND THIS RESOLUTION.

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:54.827 region:rollup2
THE WAIVER WAS FIRST INTRODUCED

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:56.628 region:rollup2
IN FIRST REQUESTED.

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:59.398 region:rollup2

THEY OF ARMENIA PROTECTION

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.470 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT WAS STARTED BY

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:06.205 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT NIXON.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.673 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS BEEN APPROVED OVER A

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:09.341 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TIMES IN FIVE

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:10.876 region:rollup2
DECADES.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:12.811 region:rollup2
AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:15.014 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AGAIN CHOSEN TO SET

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:16.281 region:rollup2
ITS OWN FATE AND OWN STANDARDS

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:17.649 region:rollup2
THAT LEAD NOT ONLY THE NATION

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:18.751 region:rollup2
AND THE WORLD.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:20.519 region:rollup2
SO I UNDERSCORE FOR YOU THE

00:25:18.751 --> 00:25:21.954 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN NATURE OF PROTECTING

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.622 region:rollup2
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:25:21.954 --> 00:25:25.157 region:rollup2
FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:26.892 region:rollup2
OUR MISSION STANDARDS AND WHY WE

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:28.660 region:rollup2
SO VERY MUCH PARTICULARLY AT

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:30.796 region:rollup2
THIS TIME NEED TO CONSIDER

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.598 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THAT EXAMPLE.

00:25:30.796 --> 00:25:34.099 region:rollup2
SECONDLY AS MIKE ARE GOOD

00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:35.734 region:rollup2
CALLING GIVES HAS POINTED OUT

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:36.568 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS THAT THE FUEL

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:37.803 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY STANDARDS A

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:39.271 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SAID HAVE ON OUR

00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:40.105 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT WE MUST CONTINUE TO

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:41.673 region:rollup2
DO THEM.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:43.876 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE PROVEN TO HAVE AN

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:45.411 region:rollup2
EFFECT NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA

00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:47.079 region:rollup2
BUT NATIONWIDE AND ACROSS I

00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:47.880 region:rollup2
THINK THE WORLD.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.214 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.649 region:rollup2
COMPONENT TO THIS SAID I WANNA

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:52.651 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE DON'T FORGET AND

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:55.020 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE PROMOTED

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:56.355 region:rollup2
MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES AND

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.290 region:rollup2
OUR STANDARDS WE HAVE ACTUALLY

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:59.725 region:rollup2
INCREASED THE AFFORDABILITY.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.993 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND

00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:02.327 region:rollup2
MOBILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS

00:26:00.993 --> 00:26:04.463 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT THAT HAPPENS IN

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:06.732 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT MAKES LIFE LESS

00:26:04.463 --> 00:26:08.033 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:09.635 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MEASURES

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:11.170 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE STAND UP FOR FUEL

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:12.638 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND THE

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.972 region:rollup2
WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE

00:26:12.638 --> 00:26:16.275 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T ALLOWED TO OUR

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:17.409 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS TO GET GREATER.

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:21.146 region:rollup2
DISTANCES GREATER MOBILITY A

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:22.981 region:rollup2
WITH MANY REASONS WHY I HOPE YOU

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:24.016 region:rollup2

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:25.517 region:rollup2

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:30.155 region:rollup2
FOR THIS IS A WAIVER THAT WAS

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:32.357 region:rollup2
ALREADY GRANTED WITH BIPARTISAN

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:32.991 region:rollup2

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.326 region:rollup2
THIRTY WAIVERS HAVE BEEN IN THE

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.894 region:rollup2
PAST.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:37.129 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SPECIAL

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:38.230 region:rollup2
TREATMENT --
