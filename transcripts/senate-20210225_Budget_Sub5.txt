THANKYOU SENATOR GREAT- THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. HI A I'M ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT- I THAT DID THE- REQUEST IS A CURRENT YOUR REQUEST TAKING ON BE ON PAGE EIGHTEEN OF THE HAND OUT- IT'S- IT'S SLATED FOR BUDGET YEAR WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S A TWENTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. ONE TIME IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO EXPAND HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIP STATEWIDE AND THE INTENSE- AS MYSTERY HAD EXPLAINED THIS TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S QUICK ECONOMIC RECOVERY- IN RESPONSE TO THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE ECONOMY BY INVESTING IN EXISTING. AND NEW PROJECTS THAT CAN SCALE QUICKLY HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE L. A- PLEASE. ACCORDING TO ALTHOUGH THE LATEST AND OFFICE WE HAVE NOTICED. CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL- REITERATING AGAIN THAT IT'S ONE OF THE EARLY ACTION ITEMS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. THE HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP IN RECENT YEARS HAS BECOME SORT OF THE STATE'S. FLAGSHIP WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS IN THAT THE STAFF OF GENDER THAT WE- SORT OF ONE OF THOSE WHAT. IS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND JUST GETTING A SENSE FOR. LONGER TERM AS THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ON THAT THE STATE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ITS OUTCOMES AND TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED THANK YOU. THE YOU MISTER RANEY COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS PLEASE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ABSOLUTELY MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE SENATE AND YOUR STAFF MADAM CHAIR I'M LOOKING AT OUTCOMES LONGER TERM FOR THE HIRING TRAINING- PARTNERSHIP WORK WE ALSO DO A VALUATION WORK ON ALL OF OUR PROJECTS INCLUDING THE HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- FOR H. R. T. P. IT'S GARC OUR EVALUATION WE'RE CURRENTLY GHOSTED THROUGH UCLA. UCLA LABOR CENTER. OKAY WE'LL JUST FOR ME I'LL START OUT WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE SECTOR WORK. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT IS DOING- I AS I WENT THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SECTORS THAT YOU ARE COVERING OR PROPOSED TO COVER AND THAT YOU HAVE COVERED- I SEE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SECTORS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED AND I'M WONDERING. WHY THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT INCLUDE- WHAT ARE THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES- AND THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY THEY'RE TWO OF THE HARDEST HIT IN THIS PANDEMIC. AND CERTAINLY- HOSPITALITY WILL COME BACK BUT IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN- I'VE NOTICED OF THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT FOOD SERVICE IS BEING. DONE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- BUT WE ARE STILL NVESTING IN FOOD SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE AND COUNTIES AND I THINK CITIES ARE. MANY AT MANY LEVELS- THEY'VE BEEN REPURPOSED SO. JUST GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE L. A. U. S. D. DISTRIBUTED MILLIONS OF MEALS. TO THE STUDENTS AND TWO ADULTS IN THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES- SO SOMEWHERE THOSE. OF MEALS WERE PRODUCED THEY WERE MADE AND PUT TOGETHER AND THEN THEY WERE DELIVERED AND THEN THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT VERSION OF HOW OUR FOOD NEEDS ARE ARE BEING MET- THE SO I'M JUST WONDERING- WHAT IS IT THAT COULD BE DONE IN THE PROPOSED MONEY- TO PARTNER WITH THESE. NEW OR RE PURPOSED OR DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE THESE SECTORS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT'S IT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT A GREAT QUESTION- WE DID FOCUS ON THIS INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA AGAIN THAT HAD A LOT OF JOB OPENINGS AND NOW- IN IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE INTENT IS TO GET. A QUICK EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY COVERED IN THE RESULTING ECONOMIC FALLOUT- I THINK THAT'S AN AMAZING POINT YOU MAKE. THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR- ALONG WITH BUILDING MAINTENANCE ARE TO THAT WERE HIT EARLY AS YOU SAY- AND HIT HARD- AND MOSTLY IMPACTED LOW INCOME WORKERS- AND IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY- AND I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY WE HAVE A HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP. IN BOTH THOSE SECTORS ABILITY SKILLS PARTNERSHIP. IN BUILDING MAINTENANCE- THAT IS RETRAINING BILLING SERVICE WORKERS INCO THE DISINFECTION OF YOUR CREATIVE- AND FORWARD LOOKING WAY OF NOT JUST MEETING. THE MOMENT- BUT ALSO DOING IN A WAY THAT RETRAINS WORKERS FOR- TO STAY EMPLOYED. THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR IN LOS ANGELES ACTUALLY IS THERE'S A HIGHER A PARTNERSHIP THE COR THERE ARE YOU NOT YOUR ELEVEN- AND HOTEL PROPERTIES AND EVENT VENUES WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT HIGH ROAD PARTNERSHIP IT'S ONE OF OUR OUR FLAGSHIP PROJECTS IN FACT. APPROVED RESILIENT THROUGH THAT PARTNERSHIP- SO THEY KEPT- AS YOU AS YOU POINTED OUT LARGE INDUSTRIAL SIZED KITCHENS OPERATING TO PROVIDE- FOOD RELIEF AND I THINK THEY REACH TEN THOUSAND PLUS- A SENIOR'S HOME BOUND SENIORS AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS GOT THREE THOUSAND OR THREE MILLION. MEALS COOKED AND DELIVERED TO HOMES WORKING WITH- TAXING AIRPORT SHUTTLE COMPANIES SO. WELL OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE. PUT BACK TO WORK AND LAUGHS WERE PREVENTED THROUGH THIS VERY CREATIVE WAY OF AGAIN MEETING THE MOMENT- AND I ALSO AGREE TO THESE THE SECTORS THAT WERE HIT HARD AND EARLY OR IN TRANSITION AND I THINK THERE. WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON EXPANDING- AND INVESTING IN THOSE IN THAT CREATIVITY THAT MARKET CREATION- BECAUSE AS- CODES CAN AND PEOPLE GO BACK. ADVANCE BUILDINGS WORK OFFICES RESTAURANTS HOTELS CONVENTIONS ALL THAT IS GOING TO COME BACK WE HAVE TO BEPREPARED. I ALSO THINK THAN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS- THERE IS- ISSUES AT THE PORTS- A CONVERSATION SHOULD BE HAD AT THE PORTS ABOUT AUTOMATION AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING- THOSE GOOD JOBS SO I WONDER IF WE COULD. CONTINUE OR- HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND HOPEFULLY THEY LEAD TO OF A REAL OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EMPLOYERS AND WATCHING OUT FOR THOSE THOSE GOOD JOBS AS WELL. YES ABSOLUTELY A GREAT EXAMPLE OF FUTURE OF FUTURE OF WORK AND LABOR MANAGEMENT WORKING TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF AUTOMATION ARE AND HOW TO HOW TO DEAL WITH IN WAYS IT REALLY PROTECT COMMUNITIES IN THE WORK FORCE SO I'M REALLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR IN YOUR STAFF. ON ON THOSE ITEMS YES MAYBE CALL IT TRANSITION SECTORS OR SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT WE'RE NOT A 100% CLEAR HOW IT'S ALL GONNA LAND BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT JOBS CONTINUE TO BE CREATED IN THAT DIRECTION. OKAY ANY. SENATORS AND COMMON OR QUESTIONS- YES CENTER ANYWAY- BEFORE A MYSTERY MYSTERY GOOD TO SEE YOU- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO. THAT THE SEVEN HOUSES WE GOT REFERENCES A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS OVER. FOUR BUDGET IN SUPPORT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE CAN YOU GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS BREAK DOWN. WHAT KIND OF JOBS ARE THESE AND ADD TO WHAT HOW DO YOU MEASURE SUCCESS AGAINST THAT LARGER OBJECTIVE OF GREENHOUSE. GAS REDUCTION. THANK YOU SENATORS IS GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO- WE MISS YOU ON THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. THANK YOU. SB SIX WEEKS. THE OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS THAT WERE OUT- ALLOCATED TO THIS THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- WERE ACTUALLY CUT BACK DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS LESS REVENUE THROUGH CAP AND TRADE. IN THAT PROGRAM SO- WE DID PUT UP ALL OF THE MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD OUT IN COMPETITIVE- GRANTS- AND WE'VE JUST- APPROVED THE FIRST ROUNDERS GRANTS AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT. A VERY SECTORS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF CLIMATE- WE'RE EXPANDING WORK IN TRANSIT IN FACT BECAUSE TRANSIT IT IS EXPANDING. A NEW VEHICLES ARE BEING ADDED TO TRANSIT FLEETS THAT ARE ZERO EMISSION BUSES. SO RETRAINING WORKERS WHO ARE DOING MAINTENANCE ON THOSE BUSES AND ALSO MECHANICS ISREALLY CRITICAL SO A LOT OF TREE TRAINING GOING ON A TRANSIT THAT'S PART OF IT- THERE'S A PROJECT THAT IS LOOKING AT THE MANUFACTURE OF. CLEAN FUEL BUSES- IN LOS ANGELES AND LOOKING TO EXPAND AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL OUT FOR. PULLING CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF COURSE REDUCING CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE- THE- BUILDING SKILLS PARTNERSHIP- PROJECT THAT I MENTIONED- WITH THE BILLING WITH- IN LOS ANGELES BUT ACTUALLY STATEWIDE. WITH S. YEAH YOU- UNITED BY. SERVICE WORKERS. ARE IN A NUMBER OF- PROPERTIES ACROSS THE STATE. THEY'RE DOING NOT JUST CALL THE DISINFECTION TRAINING- BUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING A GREEN JANITORS TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH IS HELPING THOSE. LEAD A BUILDINGS ARE MEET THOSE GOALS OF REDUCING ENERGY- INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO THOSE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF WORK. THAT ARE PART OF A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. INVESTMENTS AND I THE I THINK THAT. THE POINT THAT WE'VE MADE- PRIOR TO THAT MONEY COME TO THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD. IS YOU CAN'T. THAT MEET THE GOALS THAT THE IT REALLY. A GOALS CAL HAS THREE. CLIMB CHANGE- WITH THE WAY FORCE DO THAT WORK ACROSS THE ACROSS THE BOARD. INCLUDING STANDING UP UTILITY SCALE SOLAR AND WIND- AND OTHER RENEWABLE SO EFFICIENCY IN REPAIRING OVALS WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE WORKFORCE. APPRECIATE THAT SIR SO AGAIN THIS IS RELATIVELY NEW FOR ME MAYBE FOR OTHERS SO IF YOU COULD YOU KNOW GUESTS THAT SAY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MEASURE. SUCCESS LIKE WHAT METRICS DO YOU USE OVER TIME- TO ASCERTAIN YEAH BECAUSE THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. BOB THIS IS A REALLY GREAT YES REALLY QUICK QUESTION WE FOLLOW THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD'S GUIDELINES. ON HOW TO MEASURE- AGAINST THE- THE GOALS AROUND REDUCING GAS IS A GREENHOUSE GASES- AND SO I. HONESTLY WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE- RESOURCES BOARDING CAN GET BACK TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON EXACTLY WHAT THOSE MEASURES ARE- WE ALSO OF COURSE LOOK AT. RETRAINING IN TRAINING OF WORKERS OF BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT WORKFORCE INSIDE THE SECTORS- AND THEN CREATING ACCESS TO TWO JOBS. BUT ALSO THEY'RE ALWAYS HIGH QUALITY GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT CAN SUPPORT FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. SO OUR METRICS ON THAT WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN EASILY SHAPE THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE GOOD. AT ANY EQUITY OUTCOMES ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD YEAH I SHOULD BE QUITE GRATEFUL FOR THE A. R. V. TO TAKE ON THIS RIGHT JUST FOR MY OWN EDIFICATION SO. THANK YOU VENTURE. I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD YES SENATOR. IS A ONE JOB YOU EVER SINCE. THE TURN RECOGNIZED- I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS A GREAT QUESTION IS WONDERFUL EVAN GET CLARIFICATION- LET ME LET ME SAY FIRST- BUT- I DISTRIBUTED INFORMATION TO EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN IT AND APPRECIATE THE SENATE EVEN ASKING FOR IT- QUESTION I JUST I'M NOT SURE I LISTENED CLOSELY ENOUGH. IN ADDITION TO. THE WORKFORCE TRAINING TO GET PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE USING GENDER SYSTEM EXAMPLE I'M ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ON THAT IS THERE ALSO DOES ANY OF THIS MONEY. GO TOWARD- WORKFORCE TRANSITION AS WELL IN A WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE IN THIS IN THIS SPACE IN THIS AREA FOR US I THINK LEGISLATIVELY AS- WE CAN PUT ALL THE DETAIL IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. THE ELEMENTS AND COMPONENTS OF READ REDUCING GHG. HELLO WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO WITH BUILDINGS AT CETERA- BUT- TO DONE AS MUCH WORK IN ON THE METRICS OF- TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE DISPLACED THAT. THOSE SUCCESSES DISPLACED WORKERS- WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT AND I'M JUST WONDERING TO WHAT EXTENT IF AT ALL YOU'VE TAKEN OUT OF- YEAH WE LOOKED AT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION CENTER IT'S A GREAT ONE- WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT-WE WERE WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH THAT THE SEVERAL STATE ENTITIES ON JUST THOSE QUESTIONS OF TRANSITION SO TARGETING SECTORS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. BY THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES- AND WHAT'S GONNAHAPPEN TO THOSE THAT WORK FOR SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING ON. AT SO WE CAN TARGET OUR- OUR INVESTMENTS IN WAYS THAT HELP. RETOOL WORKERS IN RESPONSE TO THAT SO OUR INTENTION IS TO KEEP WORKERS. WHO ARE MAKING GOOD WAGES BECAUSE GOOD WAGES ARE ARE DRIVING. THE ECONOMIES OF THESE COMMUNITIES WHERE THAT ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUEL BASED INDUSTRIES- SO OUR INTENTION IS ALWAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE PRESERVE JOBS HE PEOPLE IN GOOD QUALITY JOBS TO KEEP THAT MONEY FLOWING IN COMMUNITIES. ONE WAY WE DO THAT IS THROUGH. INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE- SO ABOUT BUILDING MORE BUILDING STANDING UP MORE- USUALLY SCALE SOLAR AND WIND. IN OTHER PACKED TYPE RENEWABLE PROJECTS OR INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS. SO WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES BOB CREATING PATHWAYS INTO STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP. ARTISAN ALL OF THAT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE WORK. IS PUBLIC WORKS- AND THE WORKERS THEY ARE DISPATCHED THROUGH A HIRING HALL SEE THE TRADES SO WHAT WE DO- A LOT IS BUILDING PATHWAYS INTO THOSE A- GROUP PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS. BUT IT TO THE EXTENT WE SCALE THOSE UP. THEN I THINK IT'S MUCH EASIER TO TRANSITION WORKERS WHO ARE IMPACTED TWO OTHER GOOD HIGH WAGE JOBS. THANK YOU JUST A FOLLOW. UP- OKAY IN A- ONE I WHAT I'M WILL TO I THINK SOME. IN THIS IS ONE SENATOR SPEAKING- WE NEED MORE FORMALLY AS A LEGISLATURE CALIBRATE. OF THE SO THAT. THE INVESTMENTS ARE TRACKING TOGETHER SO THAT WE- CREATE THE ASSURANCES FOR. IN OUR RESIDENTS OUR WORKFORCES CETERA THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND HIM WE'VE ACTUALLY WE ACTUALLY OF. NOT ONLY METRICS BUT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE. SORT OF THE EQUIVALENT AYE I KNOW THEY'RE NOT DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR YOU DON'T. INVEST LIKE THIS IN IN IN GHG. REDUCTION IN AUTOMATICALLY HAVE A ONE ONE RATIO IN TERMS OF JOB REPLACEMENT BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE AT SOME POINT NEED TO GET MORE FORMAL ABOUT TRACKING THAT IS AS A LEGISLATURE THAT'S MY OPINION. ON THAT SAID WHO WHAT I ASSUME YOU HAVE PARTNERS- STAKEHOLDERS THANK THANKS YOU KNOW AGENCIES THAT ARE FEEDING INTO- THE DID THE DATABASE IF YOU WILL- THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE THAT ALL OUT. IS THAT IS THAT TRUE AND I DON'T NEED A LIST OF THEM RIGHT NOW BUT IT'LL BE GREAT ALONG WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'LL BE SENDING US- THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST ASK FOR IF YOU COULD GIVE. I'M A NEW SENATOR LIKE ME THAT INFORMATION HAS SISTER WHO. WHO'S IN THAT WORLD THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND GATHERING INFORMATION FROM IT ON THE MET METRICS OF THE WORKFORCE TRANSITION. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF WE DO WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT- THAT- IN CHARGE OF THE CLIMATE WORK- THE PUBLIC% UTILITIES COMMISSION AIR RESOURCES BOARD ENERGY COMMISSION- AND OTHERS- VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM ON STRATEGIES. FOR INVESTING IN WORKFORCE BUT ALSO IN MEASURING IMPACTS- WE WORK WITH ORGANIZED LABOR AND BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY- ALSO- THAT'S THE CORE OF IT ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR WAYS. TO HELP WORKERS STAY EMPLOYED IN TRANSITION TO NEW JOBS SO I'D I'D LOVE TO PROVIDE YOU A LOT MORE DETAIL ON THAT. SUMMIT ALSO REFERRED TO A REPORT WE DID AFTER UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER- THAT WAS REQUIRED AB. NINETY EIGHT- THAT LAYS OUT THE STRATEGY- YEAH. IN THE CONTEXT OF A CLIMATE CHANGE IN TRANSITION. IT'S QUITE A- COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING TO BUILD ON THEM AND THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU FOR THE GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ALLOW ME TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS I DO HAVE ONE. AND WHAT SUPPORTS CRITERIA FOR PARDONING PARTNERING WITH- INDIVIDUALS OR ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE SOME OF THESE RESOURCES. AM I NOTICE THAT- IF NOT ALL OF VERY LARGE PORTION- JUST SIGNATORY- ORGANIZATIONS. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ALL HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE IMPACT ON AND THE KOBE SITUATION HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. M. TO TELL YOU WORKERS HOTEL MOTEL WORKERS RESTAURANT. DISHWASHERS AND YOU KNOW AGAIN SOME OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. IS IT A BOARD POLICY TO ONLY WORK WITH SIGNATORY COMPANIES AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS. I WOULDN'T IF THAT'S NOT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE WOULDN'T IT BEHOOVE THE BOARD TO WORK WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY AS WELL THAT ARE NOT SIGNATORY COMPANIES SO THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. LIKE RESTAURANT WORKERS HOTEL MOTEL WORKERS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE TRANSITION FUNDS AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATE THAT'S IT REALLY TERRIFIC QUESTION- THE CRITERIA OF THE BOARD IS TO WORK WITH. WHAT WE CALL HIRED EMPLOYERS- THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT- THAT PAY A LIVING WAGE- PROVIDE. A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH BENEFITS- INVEST IN THEIR WORKERS THROUGH TRAINING AND UPSKILLING- AND- HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MILK MOBILITY INSIDE A COMPANY OR INSIDE SECTOR- SO DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SIGNATORY EMPLOYERS AT ALL- BUT THAT IS A GREAT AREA WE'RE WE'RE- THE- THE GOAL HERE IS WE'RE USING- LIMITED DOLLARS BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. IS SO LARGE- LIMITED DOLLARS INVESTING THOSE DOLLARS. IN IN SECTORS EMPLOYERS. THAT OFFER REALLY GOOD QUALITY JOBS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO OUR OUR TARGET POPULATIONS ARE THOSE WHO. ARE LOW INCOME AND HAVE LOTS OF BAIRSTOW PLAMEN. SO WE DON'T WANT TO SPEND LIMITED DOLLARS PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK IN- IN HIGH TURNOVER JOBS WHERE THEY END UP BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. OUR INTENTION IS TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS THAT HAVE REAL CAREERS SO WE CAN LIFT COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY. SO- SO THAT'S A GREAT THREE WE HAVE A- BUDGET THAT WE HAVE THE WORST WORKING ON CALL TYRA KITCHENS SO IT'S- ENDED. RESTAURANTS ARE THIS. HELLO THEM THROUGH THE PANDEMIC FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO STAY EMPLOYED TO KEEP WORKERS EMPLOYED. THOSE ARE NOT SIGNATORY EMPLOYERS BUT BUT HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD HI ROADWORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THAT OF COURSE.

FORTUNATELY AND PASSED IT BY THE PANDEMIC WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED MULTIPLE TRAINING RESOURCES SUCH AS IN DEPTH WORKSHOPS AND ONLINE COURSES TO BETTER EQUIP WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS WITH INFORMATION SCALE AND WE STARTED TO TAKE ACTION. TO MAKE WORKPLACES SAFER. SHE GAVE LABOR AGENT AND OUR DEPART OF INDUSTRY RELATIONS HAVE COMMITTED NEARLY TWENTY. OF THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AUTHORIZED BY AT THE ONE FIFTEEN ALL TOWARD COBIT BELATED OUTREACH EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT TO BE SENT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS BEING MADE AS PART OF THAT BROADER CAMPAIGN- THE FIRST IS THAT EARLIER THIS MONTH WE ANNOUNCED THAT FIFTY FOUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. HAS BEEN FUNDED TO CONDUCT COVERT RELATED OUTREACH WITH A FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. IT ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CONDUCTING OUTREACH FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND REPRESENT BROAD DIVERSE CITY AND THEIR REACH. BACK AND LABOR AGENCY RECENTLY LAUNCHED AN EMPLOYER PORTAL ON OUR SITE THAT IS A CENTRALIZED RESOURCE FOR EMPLOYERS EMPLOYERS TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED ABOUT HOW TO FOLLOW LOCAL AND STATE GUIDANCE. IN ONE CENTRAL HUB. THESE OUT WE AND TRAINING ACTIVE. ARE WITH STRATEGIC AND- BY THE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. DURING THE PANDEMIC THE I. R. HAD. TO CONDUCT TARGETED ENFORCEMENT TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS WHILE UTILIZING THE ADMISSION OF FUNDING- ALLOCATED UNDER SB ONE FIFTEEN TO INCREASE STAFFING CAPACITY AND UTILIZE TECHNOLOGY TO GAIN EFFICIENCY AND CLAIMS PROCESSING AND INVESTIGATION. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS- ELABORATE FURTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. I'M ARGUMENT A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO COMMENTS BUT ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU I L. A- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. I DON'T KNOW THE L. A- SIMILARLY- THIS EMBRACE AUTUMN HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS. OKAY GREAT- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WITH REGARDS TO THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO- I GUESS THAT WORKERS FOR WORKPLACE IS MY UNDERSTANDING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR WORKPLACE EDUCATION- HOW HOW WERE THE FUNDS USE CAN YOU GIVE ME EXAMPLES OF HOW THAT. WAS USED TO HELP THE WORKERS AND THE WORKPLACES CARRY OUT HEALTH PROTOCOLS. YES WORKERS ARE RECEIVING EDUCATION THROUGH BOTH THE CBO OUTREACH EFFORTS AS WELL AS SOME TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING CARRIED OUT BY OUR PARTNERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SO ON THE FIRST POINT DEVIDOS- WHAT THE FIFTY FOUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE ARE TRYING. ARE BEING TRAINED- WITH WORKPLACE RIGHT INFORMATION ON HOW TO NAVIGATE DIFFERENT STATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND- THAT INFORMATION IS REALLY WHAT THEY WILL USE TO ENGAGE ON A DEEPER HIGH LEVEL- OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE ORGANIZATION WITHOUT WITHOUT COMMUNITIES AND BY THAT I MEAN. WE'RE GOING BEYOND- ONE WAY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WIRING OR- COUNTY THING AND WE'RE REALLY ASKING THE ORGANIZATION TO CONDUCT WORKSHOPS PRESENTATIONS AND HAVE ONE ON ONE CONVERSATIONS IN ORDER TO REALLY ASK THAT. FOLKS TO CONNECT TO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED- FIND THE MORE TRAINING RELATED- PROGRAMS WE ARE PARTNERING WITH- UC BERKELEY UC DAVIS AND UCLA AND THEIR RESPECTIVE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY BANNER. WHO HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING COMMUNITY TRAINING TO WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS SOMETIMES IN VERY THANK INDUSTRY ABOUT HOW TO ADOPT AND COOL HMO THAT PRACTICES AROUND BURKE THINK HELPING EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED CO BAD BITE. SUCH A TAPE THAT CLEAN- AND- ANTI RETALIATION UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF THESE RIGHT I NEED TO. BE COMPLIMENTING EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF CODE. AND MARK STONE. DID YOU- IN ADVANCE. NO OR TARA CERTAIN INTO ARE THAT YOU THOUGHT MIGHT NEED IT MORE. OR WAS IT THROUGH THE COME BAY DRUG. THAT THEY DO AND THEN LATER TOLD YOU WHAT THEY WERE DOING. OF WHAT KIND OF. PLANNING OR MAPPING WAS DONE ON ON IN THAT SENSE. YES WE DID CONTROLLED WHERE- DIR INDICATED THAT WE HAVE ON ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO COMPLAINTS THAT WE FOURTEEN ESTABLISH WHAT ARE THOSE HIGHER RISK INDUSTRY- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DATA IS GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH- THAT THE NEW TAG LINE IN TERMS OF THE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY FOR FRONT LINE WORKERS THANK YOU CAN YOU TO- TO- ST TO BE. TO GO TO WORK- AND BE EXPOSED- TO EACH OTHER AND THE PUBLIC SO- WE DID IDENTIFY TARGET INDUSTRY- AND THEN WE IDENTIFIED ORGANIZATION HAD REACHED. INTO THOSE INDUSTRIES- AND THOUGH THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE- I CAN LIST THEM. OUT- THEY ARE- JANITORIAL OF THE INCLUDES- HOUSEKEEPING- DIFFERENT TACK OF WHICH FOOD PROCTOR R. AS AS PACKING I RESTAURANT AND THEN WE HAVE MANY FACTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE GARMENT IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA- AND THEN OF COURSE AFTER CULTURE- FARM WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS ADDS ACTORS- AND- WAREHOUSE AND LOGISTICS. OKAY THANK YOU- AND JUST ONE MORE- ISSUE HERE I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT ALSO RECEIVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTIONS TO ASSIST HOSPITALITY WORKERS AND RETURNING TO WORK- THIS IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO ME BECAUSE WOMEN MAKE UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY- AND THAT THEY'VE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY WOMEN ARE STRUGGLING MORE. THAN MEN WE ALL REMEMBER DECEMBER'S REPORT AND IT SHOWED A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND JOBS LOST ALL WERE HELD BY WOMEN IN TOTAL WOMEN LOST A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND JOBS SO- THE PANDEMIC- RELATED JOB LOSSES WERE AMONGST HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS WOMEN OF COLOR OVER FIFTY- AND WOMEN WHO HAVE THE LOWEST STATISTICAL POSSIBILITY OF EVEN BEING INTERVIEWED FOR A NEW JOB SO GETTING BACK TO THE JOB IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD- JOBLESS WOMEN ARE WORK AT AGE FIFTY TO SIXTY ONE- AND AS YOU GET OLDER OLDER I LIKE SIXTY TWO AN OLDER. THERE SO THIS IS A THIS PARTICULAR OUR AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF- THEIR RIGHT TO RETURN TO THEIR JOBS- IS OF AGAIN PARTICULAR. IMPORTANCE TO ME- I HOPE DIDN'T. WILL ENGAGE WITH US ON THIS AND LET US KNOW IF THE RECALL RIGHTS PROPOSAL OUR RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S THE BEETLE OF- AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN- WITH THAT I IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO. THE SPECIFICALLY THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WAS SET ASIDE FOR- RETURNING TO WORK FOR THOSE WORKERS. YES A FIFTY DOLLARS HAS BEEN UTILIZED FOR STRATEGIC ENFORCEMENT INCREASED CAPACITY CLOSURE. TWO INCLUDE HOSPITALITY WORKERS AS WELL AS OTHER HIGH RISK INDUSTRIES- AND WE'VE TAKEN A VERY HOLISTIC APPROACH TO- ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT- STILL WE ALSO FEED OUTREACH WORK AS PART OF OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IN OUR EXPERIENCE IF YOU DON'T HAVE AFFECTED OUTREACH IT WILL HAMPER THE ABILITY OF OUR STATE STAFF TO DEAL EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE FRONTLINE OF IMPORTANCE AS OUTREACH AND FILLS WE NEED TO HAVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE- DEATH YOU HAVE REACHED IN Q. HOSPITALITY WORKERS AND THEY WILL ALSO BE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH OUR DEPARTMENT STAFF YOU IDENTIFY CHIEF. AND REFERRED FINANCIAL AYE HIGH IMPACT CASES TO OUR DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION- AND THEN ON THAT ENFORCEMENT- WE NOT ONLY ARE WE ARE INVESTIGATING AND FINDING VIOLATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY BUT WE ARE ALSO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH EMPLOYERS TO PROMOTE COMPLIANCE- AND YOU KNOW. CALSHOT DIVISION DOES HAVE A CONSULTATION BRANCH THAT IS AVAILABLE TO CONSULT- WITHOUT RISK OF- ENFORCEMENT OF THE WALL BETWEEN THE COMPLICATION BRANCH AND THAT ENFORCEMENT. UNIT I FEEL THAT EMPLOYERS CAN GET HELP WITH A COMPLIANCE AND THAT LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE HAS ALSO LAUNCHED AND EARLY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS- TARGETING BUSINESSES SO THAT IT PROVIDES EARLY INTERVENTION- INTO- PREVENT FURTHER VIOLATIONS SO WE COUPLE OUTREACH WITH THE ENFORCEMENT AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S LITTLE PLASTIC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT ALSO- AND PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED SUPPORT TEST INDUSTRY- AND THIS IS A BROADER SPECTRUM OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO- HE USED TO THE COURT HI THE TALLY IN THE- ALONG. WITH OTHER HIGH RISK AND- OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD TO GET MORE IN OF THAT- ENTER OF THIS AMOUNT THAT WENT DODD TO THEM FOR OF ASSIST AUSTIN WERE TO GET JOB BACK THANK YOU MUCH SENATORS SAY NEWMAN. THANK YOU MEDICARE SO YOUR QUESTION MISS PARKER SO I I'VE QUESTION AROUND THE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN SPECIFICALLY. THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN CONDUCTED THROUGH AN AGENCY SO THAT'S ABOUT 40% OF THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE. HOW DID YOU DETERMINE THAT ALLOCATION- AND- YOU KNOW WHY THAT AMOUNT ESPECIALLY AGAINST OTHER EFFORTS LIKE COMMUNICATION. AND HOW DO YOU MEASURE SUCCESS OF A PUBLIC. ANNOUNCEMENT CAMPAIGN LIKE HAT ESPECIALLY THE VERY. KIND OF COWDED NOISY MEDIA MARKET IS THAT IS THAT THE BEST RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT. YES SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND TACTICS BEING DEPLOYED UNDER THAT MEDIA CAMPAIGN- SO THEY DO INCLUDE A TRADITIONAL MEDIA THINGS LIKE RADIO ADS OUT DOOR ADS- IN DIGITAL- ADD- BUT THEY ALSO. PROVIDE OR THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND HAVE MORE ROBUST INFORMATION AND- MANY MORE LANGUAGES SO THAT CONTRACT ALLOWS THAT Q. NOT JUST PUT OUT ADS IN THE MEDIA MARKET BUT CREATE OUTREACH MATERIALS. AND MORE LANGUAGE SO WE HAVE CURRENTLY A LIST OF TWENTY SEVEN LANGUAGES THANKS WE WANT TO PRODUCE OUT WE CAN CARRY OUT THE AND- AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE- INFORMATION YOU CAN GET YOUR LANGUAGE AND- WE'RE DEVELOPING INFORMATION AND MOM. COPY THAT WERE REALLY TRYING TO BE EXPENSIVE AND EXPANSIVE AND HOW WE ARE REACHING A PUBLIC THROUGH THOSE PUBLIC AWARENESS DOLLARS I'M STILL JUST MY FIRST POINT IS TO CLARIFY THAT. WHILE THERE ISN'T A BUSINESS ON PAID MEDIA- THAT WORK ALSO COMPASSES OUTREACH AND THAT IT CREATED ALLOWS US TO CREATE MORE ROBUST INFORMATION I THANK YOU THE- THE OTHER PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS CAN ACCESS. IN THAT IN THAT APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE- IN TERMS OF MEASURING SUCCESS CERTAINLY THERE IS- IS THAT TRADITIONAL COMMUNICATIONS ON THAT TRICKS THAT WE ARE TRACKING IN TERMS OF REACH. BUT WE ALSO ANECDOTALLY ARE ALREADY OBSERVING. AN IMPACT TO ENFORCEMENT AND THAT WE ARE WE THINKING MARK PHONE CALLS WORKING MORE WEB TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE AD YOU TRIED. THE PUBLIC TO OUR PRIMARY RESOURCES. ON OUR WEBSITE AND SO WE ARE SEEING THAT- IN THAT WORK THE P. PAY MEDIA IS WORKING. OUT MORE WE'VE ALSO BEEN RESEARCH THROUGH- THROUGH THAT CAN. AND TO THE CONTRACT- WITH THAT MEDIA VENDOR AT THE RESEARCH HAS- INCLUDE FOCUSED GROUPS I WITH IMPACTED. ON A SECTOR AND THE ALSO CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS WITH. INCLUDING AN- AND DO THAT WE MAY BEEN ABLE TO H WHAT IS IT WHERE ARE THE FOR GAP AND WATER THAT BACK WAYS GET THE MESSAGE OUT- SO FOR A- THE- ESTABLISH THROUGH THE RESEARCH THERE IS QUITE. A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHICH DEPARTMENT WHICH DIVISION PROVIDES WHICH SERVICES AND HOW WORKERS CAN NAVIGATE HOW EMPLOYER CAN NAVIGATE- ALL OF THAT THEY ARE YET EIGHT PROGRAMS AND SO THESE ARE ALL LEARNING THAT WE ARE APPLYING- AND THAT THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS WILD- IT IS ABOUT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT. THAT WERE INVESTED. TO THE CBO OUTREACH ACTIVITY IT REALLY DOES UNDER GUARD- DATE ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS THE OUTREACH WORK BECAUSE THREE OUT RESEARCH AND THROUGH THAT CAN TRANSLATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF COLLATERAL WERE ABLE TO MAKE ALL. THE INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE. IT'S JUST I GUESS WHAT I'M HERE IS THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS. MAYBE SOME GOING OFF STAFF ANALYSIS SO THAT THAT'S NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING- HELLO OPEN WITH ME OF MONEY PER SE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF OTHER AREAS. AND SO I DON'T SHE BE GREAT. FOR A SOME DE SO WE COULD SEE. HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN IN AND HOW IT RELATES TO OTHER- IF ONLY FOR A FEW REF BUT BUT THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION. I THINK THIS IS. GOING TO GROW. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A FEW I USE IN THE B. PARK THAT YOU ARE CONTACTED WITH A FIFTY FOUR ORGANIZATIONS OR INDUSTRY FOR ORGANIZATIONS WAS ONE OF THOSE OR WERE TWO OF THOSE A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OR THE CALIFORNIA- HOSPITALITY IN HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION. DO YOU RECALL. I DON'T BELIEVE SO WE DO HAVE- YOUR SERVING ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMERCE ANNUAL WORKFORCE PARTNERSHIP BY- THOSE TWO THAT YOU NAMED- pFUNDING. PROGRAM THANK YOU AND IF I COULD GET A LIST OF THAT SENT TO MY OFFICE THE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH SHE CONTRACTED WITH I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE MOST AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR SHUT DOWN WE'RE OBVIOUSLY. OF HOTEL WORKERS WHICH THE WOMAN SAID M. AND ADEQUATELY- ENERGY SHE FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WOMEN WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. AND SERVICE WORKERS AS FAR AS HOSPITALITY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THOSE TWO INDUSTRIES ALONG WITH SOLANO OUR SALON STYLIST WERE THE MOST AFFECTED- INDUSTRIES THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OR THE HOSPITALITY WORKERS THAT DO SERVERS. THE- HOTEL- AND- IN. IS AS WORKERS IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. INSIDERS MY CURIOSITY IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZATION PER SE LIKE FINAL CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION THAT HAS. BEEN A ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS RESTAURANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE OVER TO FOREMOST TWO MILLION EMPLOYEES- DEBBIE IS PRETTY EFFECTIVE WAY TO REACH THOSE EMPLOYEES TO TEACH THEM ABOUT- SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY. I'M CURIOUS WHY AND HOW. YOU WOULD PICK THE ORGANIZATIONS IN WHICH YOU PARTNERED WITH- WIND- IN A MUCH. ADVOCATING COME SENSE RIGHT THESE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THAT THAT GOVERNOR SHUT DOWN- SO I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND- AND I AM I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HALF OF WHAT OF THE FIFTY FOUR I BELIEVE FOR A FIFTY. FIFTY FOUR AT ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU PARTNERED WITH SO I'D LIKE THAT LIST IN IN- I'D LIKE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY YOU WOULDN'T PARTNER THE SENATE HAD ACCESS TO OVER TWO MILLION RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNOR SAID DOWN. SO THAT THEY COULD BE ADEQUATELY- INFORMED ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PAID A CONSULTANT TO DO YOUR DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PAID- I KNOW THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED. BUT I THINK A SIMPLE EMAIL- OUT TO ONE OF THE FROM ONE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO LET EMPLOYEES KNOW- THE BENEFITS OF WHAT YOU WERE ALLOWING THEM TO DO AN EMPLOYER'S. AT THE SMALL BIT RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE- BEEN DRASTICALLY AFFECTED BY THE SHUTDOWN WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. AND THAT AND A GREAT WAY TO REACH I'M A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO REACH. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR WE WILL PROVIDE THAT LIST IT IS HOSTED PUBLICLY- THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND- I DO WANT TO- EIGHT WE ARE COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH GARY YES CLEAR AN INDUSTRY. ORGANIZATION AND WE HAVE DONE SO SOMETIMES- THE DAY THEY ME SO WHEN YOU TAKE A STEP BACK STILL WORKING INDICATIONS THAT ARE FUNDED OUR- KINI BASED ORGANIZATION THAT. ARE IN IT EXPECTED TO GO OUT INTO THE FIELD AND REACH THE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES- IN THE MOST HARDEST HIT FACTORED THAT BEING SAID WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN PARTNERING WITH EMPLOYERS TO GET INFORMATION AND- ASK ABOUT THE EMPLOYER PORTAL THAT WE'VE CREATED OUT TO EMPLOYERS. YEAH WE'VE MATT WHERE OSHER WHY EMPLOYER ARE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TO DEVELOP. AND GROW PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THINGS LIKE EMAIL BLAST WEAPON. AFTER WE- TRAININGS AND PRESENTATIONS TO THEIR MEMBERS WHICH DO INCLUDE EMPLOYERS AND MANY OF OUR UC'S TRAINING WORKSHOP THAT WE'RE FINDING ARE ALSO TARGETED TO EMPLOYERS AND ARE BEING PROMOTED. IN ACTIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS SO WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE ENGAGE WITH ORGANISATIONS- ARE STATE WIDE INDUSTRY LEADERS AND. WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU MEASURE THANK YOU FOR. OKAY THANK YOU MUCH- LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE. BUT TWELVE NUMBER ELEVEN. WE SHOULD ELEVENTH OF DILLON SKIP OVER THAT- OKAY- A WILL BE ON THE PRESENT PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN RAINY HERE- SORRY FOR SHOWING UP AGAIN. VERY VERY QUICKLY- WALK THROUGH THE PROPOSAL- AND- TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS IS THE SAME PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR MAY LAST YEAR- THE PROPOSAL IS TO CONSOLIDATE FOR WORKFORCE ENTITIES BETTER WITHIN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- INTO ONE SINGLE WORKFORCE- DEPARTMENT UNDER COMMON LEADERSHIP WITH COMMON GOALS- INCOME STRATEGIES- SO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. ANY EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL ARE BOTH WITHIN TE LABOR AGENCY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER WHOLE CLOTH. THE DIVISION DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS WHICH IT WOULD BE PULLED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THE WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH EDT WOULD BE PULLED INTO THE NEW DEPARTMENT AS WELL. IT'S A TWO STEP PROCESS. A STATUTORY CHANGES THIS YEAR THAT'S WHAT'S BEFORE- YOU- AND THAT IS THAT CONSOLIDATING THIS STATUTORY LANGUAGE RELATED TO THIS FOR ENTITIES INTO A NEW DIVISION SIX OF THE LABOR CODE. MY COLLEAGUE MICHAEL CABELL WHOSE ON- CAN WALK YOU THROUGH ANY DETAILS ON THAT- THAT YOU NEED TO WALK THROUGH- BUDGET CHANGES WOULD BE NEXT YEAR. SO THE NEW DEPARTMENT WILL SUBMIT A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE REQUESTING TO MOVE OTHER POSITIONS- FROM. THE DEPARTMENTS AFFECTED- THAT WERE PULLING- FROM- AND AGAIN THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THEY BECOME WHOLE CLOTH- SO- IT'S GOING TO TAKE US. A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IN THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE VERY DELIBERATE ABOUT THIS- FOR STANDING UP THE NEW DEPARTMENT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY IN FACT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT- AT FOUR YEAR- TO THIS POINT. AND WILL BE WORKING ON IT FOR ANOTHER YEAR- JUST A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY THIS CONSOLIDATION IS IMPORTANT. FIRST FOUR SHOULD FOLLOW FOR. THE WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH. INSIDE ET DE IS A WORK FORCE FUNCTION WITHIN A DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON BENEFITS AND TAXATION INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- THE DIVISION APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS. IS A WORK FORCE FUNCTION. THAT IS WITHIN A DEPARTMENT WHOSE PRIMRY FOCUS IS LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE WAY WE DESIGNED THIS. IS ABOUT WHAT PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO FORM FOLLOWING FUNCTION. THE CONSOLIDATED WORKFORCE DEPARTMENT WILL FOCUS ON WORKFORCE. WHICH IS CRITICAL NOW AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE HELPING WORKERS TRANSITION AND DIFFICULT TIMES. GET ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS SO THE NEW DEPARTMENTS FOCUSED ON INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS AND REGIONAL TALENT DEVELOPMENT. PATHWAYS TO QUALITY JOBS. EQUITY IN INCOME ABILITY AS WE TALKED ABOUT FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED GOOD JOBS HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS. AND OF COURSE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- THE SECOND REASON. FOR THE SYSTEM ALIGNMENT. IS ACHIEVE A GREATER SCALE AND IMPACT FOR CURRENT OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS. WORKFORCE PROGRAM SERVICES ARE DELIVERED LOCALLY THERE UP THERE NOT DELIVERED FROM SACRAMENTO. BEAT THEIR DELIVERED WHERE- WHERE PEOPLE NEED SERVICES- AND THEY'RE SCATTERED ACROSS MULTIPLE AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS DIFFERENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS DIFFERENT SERVICE CULTURES. THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR COMPANIES AND FOR WORKERS TO NAVIGATE. IT'S JUST TOO COMPLEX IS TOO MUCH OF PATCHWORK. THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF GREATER IMPACT FROM- FROM OUR INVESTMENTS- WE DON'T THINK THE FIX CAN ONLY HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE PUSHED. OUT FOR A LONG TIME. FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ALIGN THEIR SERVICES. AND THAT HAS TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S THE POINT OF SERVICE DELIVERY. BUT WE CREATE THE DYSFUNCTION. IN SACRAMENTO TO A LARGE EXTENT- SO WE NEED TO WALK THE TALK WE NEED TO DO THE ALIGNMENT IN SACRAMENTO. BUT THE FEDS NEED TO DO THE ALIGNMENT- SO THAT WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO LOCAL AGENCIES. THOSE SERVICES ARE BETTER ALIGNED TO PEOPLE CAN NAVIGATE THOSE AND GET ACCESS TO THE SERVICES NEED AND SO COMPANIES CAN GET ACCESS TO THE WORKERS THAT THEY NEED TO HIRE- THIS CONSOLIDATION IS A STEP. I BIG STEP TOWARD ALIGNING MULTIPLE PROGRAMS UNDER THE SAME LEADERSHIP I ENVISIONED THROUGH A SINGLE WORKFORCE. THAT. ENTITY- I THINK THAT. WELL I KNOW BECAUSE WE GOT A LETTER FROM BOTH LABOR BUSINESS THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF NAVIGABILITY FOR WORKERS AND FOR COMPANIES- BUSINESSES AND- WORKER REPRESENTATIVES AROUND THE STATE HAVE HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF ACCESSING SERVICES I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT THE INVESTMENT IS TOO SMALL ISSUE IT IT MAY BE- BUT IT'S JUST NOT A LINES WELL ENOUGH SO WE RECEIVE LETTERS FROM THAT CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION YOU COMMITTEE HAS- AND THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND ALOT OF OTHER ENTITIES TWELVE OR THIRTEEN TOTAL- THAT SAY THEY SHOULD HAPPEN THIS DEBATE SUPPORT THIS NEW DEPARTMENT SO I THINK. WHEN YOU HAVE LABOR- AND IN BUSINESS TOGETHER ON THE SAME PAGE OR SOMETHING OR SOMETHING CERTAINLY RIGHT GOING ON- THE WORK IS NOT DONE WITH THIS THERE STILL ARE THIRTY WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IN SACRAMENTO THEY'RE ADMINISTERED TO THIRTEEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN AGENCIES SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR MISALIGNMENT AND FRAGMENTATION THAT CONSUMES PRECIOUS TIME. THAT COMPANIES DON'T HAVE AN CERTAINLY JOB SEEKERS DON'T HAVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TIME RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PATCHWORK OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE NEED TO FIX THAT- SO THEY SAY THIS CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY ONLY IS. SIGNIFICANT FOR STEP IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER RAINY- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. YES MARC JIMENEZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE PURPOSE OF THIS REORGANIZATION IS TO MAKE EFFICIENCIES IN THE STATE'S FRAGMENTED WORK FOR SYSTEMS ON TO IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY ON WHICH IS A CRITICAL STRATEGY AS WE WORK TOWARDS THE STATE'S OUT QUICK ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND I GETTING PEOPLE INTO GOOD QUALITY. JOBS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS THE L.A. O. OFFICE HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON IT. DONNA WITH- LET'S ANALYSTS OFFICE WE'VE PRODUCED A SHORT ANALYSIS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IT'S GOING TO BRING UP THREE POINTS FROM THE ANALYSIS. ON THE FIRST IS THAT THE FUNCTIONS PROPOSED TO BE PERFORMED BY THE NEW DEPARTMENT SEEM TO US. TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE COORDINATING ROLE THAT LABOR AGENCY ITSELF HAS HISTORICALLY PLAYED. INTO THE QUESTION- ALONG THIS LINE FOR OUR OFFICES REALLY WHAT'S PREVENTING ON THESE FUNCTIONS AND THESE PROGRAMS FROM. MORE COORDINATED. WITH A SINGLE VISION AS AS MISTER READY MENTIONED- CURRENTLY SO WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS THEIR AGENCY AND IN AND THE ADMINISTRATION UP TO THIS POINT HASN'T CLEARLY ARTICULATED WHY. LABOR AGENCY ISN'T ABLE TO COORDINATE THESE FUNCTIONS AS IT HAPPENED THE PAST THE SECOND ISSUE THAT THERE WE RAISING THE ANALYSIS- IS IT IS IT IS NOT CLEAR OUR OFFICE WHAT SPECIFIC PROBLEM IS INTENDED TO BE SOLVED BY CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WGES- WITHOUT A CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENT. A DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS SUB COMMITTEE TO SORT OF JUDGE THE PROPOSAL AND ALSO DIFFICULT IN THE FUTURE DECEPTICON ABILITY AND TO ASSESS WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING ITS OBJECTIVES. ON THE THIRD ISSUE WE RAISING ANALYSIS AND ONE THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT- IN OUR REVIEW- I'VE GIVEN THE PANDEMIC IS THAT THE PROPOSED NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBSAND HIGHER WAGES WOULD SHIFT ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED STAFF. FROM THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND THE LEAST OFF AS MISTER RANEY MENTIONED WORKING WORK FOR SERVICES AND NOT DIRECTLY WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM- WE WORRY. THAT LEADERSHIP BOTH AT THE LABOR AGENCY AND AT THE EDT WOULD SPEND CONSIDERABLE FOCUS AND ATTENTION. ON WHAT IS A CHALLENGING REORGANIZATION PROCESS OBJECTS DESCRIBE FROM STATE'S CALL. INTEREST AND- IT WILL THE BACK OF YOUR CLAY TO PROCESS- AND- IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING OUR FRAUDULENT CLAIM ACTIVITY HAVE YOU DEEPER IN THIS TIME AS A MOVING FORWARD AT THIS POINT- SEEMS TO POSE A SERIOUS REST RISK AND ARGUE TO THE STATE'S THE STATE'S CLEAR EFFORTS NOW- WITH YOU I AT THE ET- THAT ARE ONGOING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER RANEY COULD YOU RESPOND TO THOSE. QUESTIONS BY THE L. A. O. OF COORDINATION WHAT'S THE PROBLEM AND- THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON EDT. I MEAN POTENTIAL IMPACT ACTUALLY ON THE CLAIMS THE MEN AND WOMEN FILE CLAIMS AND ADD. SURE I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES A CHANCE ALAMOS ANALYSIS- V. THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT THAT THAT MISTER ALMA BROUGHT UP NUMBER ONE ISI THINK A STRUCTURAL. ISSUE THAT I WANT TO. RESPOND TO THE OTHER IS THE PROBLEM TO SOLVE- AND I CAN I CAN REITERATE THAT ONE- AND THAT POTENTIAL DISRUPTION TO. EDIE'S WORK AROUND BENEFITS- THE STRUCTURAL ONE IS. UP WHICH WE HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF ALIGNMENT AMONG THESE DEPARTMENTS AND SERVICES OVER OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT IT OVER THE LAST YEARS WE WORKED AT AS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. DEVELOPING THE NEW DEPARTMENT- HOWEVER- THE REAL pWOULD BE SOLD BY ONE SINGLE DEPARTMENT AND THOSE ARE. MULTIPLE EIGHT DEPARTMENTS OR ENTITIES THAT DO THEIR OWN CONTRACTING- MULTIPLE ENTITIES TO HAVE THEIR OWN LEGAL I DO LEGAL ANALYSIS AND- MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS DO PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. SO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL A SINGLE WORKFORCE ENTITY. LIKE A LOCAL WORK FOR SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE GRANTS FROM THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARDS HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP COULD HAVE ANY G. P. GRANT- COULD BE. GETTING FUNDING OR REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE OVERSEEN BY THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. AND MAY BE RUNNING AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT CONTRACTING ENTITIES DIFFERENT LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS DIFFERENT CRIED. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT- THAT HAVE DIFFERENT SERVICE DELIVERY CULTURES. IT'S SPECTRUM AND IT IS. TAKING AWAY. OUR VALUABLE RESOURCES TO THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAVE TO FOCUS ALL THE BACK ON ADMINISTRATION INSTEAD OF PROVIDING SERVICES. TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM IN THE BUSINESSES WHO NEED THEIR SERVICES- SO THE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT'S BEYOND. THE GOOD WORK I THINK WE'VE DONE- IN INTO LINING. UP OR OR WORK ACROSS THESE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. THE SECOND ONE IS A PROBLEM TO SOLVE AND I. I BELIEVE THAT. WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT REALLY THE INTENT HERE. IS TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN ANYBODY ANY BUSINESS WHO'S TRYING TO GET GET SERVICES. OUT FROM THE WORK FORCE SYSTEM. ANY JOB SEEKERS TRYING TO FIND ACCESS TO SERVICES. WILL SAY THIS THAT IT'S COMPLEX IT'S A PATCHWORK IN IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND TO NAVIGATE- SO THE INTENTION. HERE THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE IN THE THIS IS MOVING THE OF SOLVING PROMISED THE IT'S NOT- THAT SILVER BOW. BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY- TO GET THEIR- WHERE THE SERVICES ARE ARE I'M WE'RE MAXIMIZING THE IMPACT WITH THESE INVESTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S MAKING- AND THEN DISRUPTION WITH IMMEDIATE. TAKING THE WORK FOR SERVICES WORK- AND MOVING INTO A DEPARTMENT WHOSE SOLE FOCUS. IS WORKFORCE AWAY FROM A DEPARTMENT THAT WHERE THE LEADERSHIP IS CONSUMED AND SHOULD BE CONCERNED- AND IS AND IS WORKING VERY VERY HARD. TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF BENEFITS TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A CRISIS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY THERIGHT MOVE- IMMEDIATE WILL ON GOING FOCUS ON BENEFITS AND TAXATION. AND THE WORK FORCE PIECE IS GOING TO GET THE FOCUS IT DESERVES AND IT NEEDS ESPECIALLY IN A CRISIS BY BEING IN A DEPARTMENT THAT IS FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE. I HOPE BY AT RESPONDED TO THE TO THE THREE POINTS. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IS- HOW DO YOU SEE THAT THE CONSOLIDATION UP COULD EXPAND JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS ESPECIALLY FOR HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED COMMUNITIES- OF. CAN THIS CONSOLIDATION. THANK GOD ON MORE ASSERTIVELY AND YOU KNOW GET GREATER RESULTS. OR IS THAT JUST SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE A PUNCHED. YEAH I THINK THANK YOU SENATOR IS A GREAT QUESTION- THE NEW DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO BE BUILT- ROUNDED THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF HIGH ROAD THAT I TALKED ABOUT A BIT EARLIER- INDUSTRY GAUGE WHEN A FOCUS THAT SO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WORKFORCE ENTITIES ARE CURRENTLY DOING INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT SEPARATELY SO BRINGING THAT TOGETHER AROUND THIS HYBRID CONCEPT. A DEEP INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT- SO IT'S KIND OF A ALIGNMENT OF THOSE EFFORTS BUT WITHIN THE MISSION STRATEGIES OF HIGH ROAD FOCUSING ON SECTORS. IN REGIONS- SECTORS ARE DRIVING EMPLOYMENT AND CREATING PATHWAYS TO THOSE GOOD QUALITY JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED THEM- AND THEN SECONDLY- JOB SEEKER SERVICES ALIGNING THOSE AT THE STATE LEVEL GETS OF IT THAT'S THE SUPPLY THE SERVICES ARE NAVIGABLE OF MAKING THAT HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE CONNECTING PROGRAMS. PATHWAYS TO THOSE GOOD JOBS- AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS AS POLICY RESEARCH EVALUATION AND INNOVATION SO LOOKING AT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK THROUGH THROUGH THE EVALUATION WORK AND MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY HI AFFECTING POLICY AND PROGRAM. SO THOSE THREE PIECES ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NEW DEPARTMENT IN FACT- IT'S NOT IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUT- THE INTENTION IS TO CREATE A TO BUILD THAT INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT SO. EVERYTHING THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT AROUND- ACCORDION JOB QUALITY THAT'S THAT'S THE CORE OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND ITS WORK. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE WELL I'M I FOR ONE AM AND TO HEAR THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ROAD PARTNERSHIP ARE. THERE IN THE pEXPLICIT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO. GET CREATE MORE GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE STATE THEY'RE FAR MORE PEOPLE. WHO NEED AND WANT A GOOD BETTER PAYING JOBS SO. WE'VE GOT TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS. AND AND TRAINING PROGRAMS OF. ANY ANY WAY THAT WE COULD CONNECT INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES OF AND- THEY USUALLY ARE THE HARDEST HIT BUT DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF A LOT OF. A LOT OF PROGRAMS- THAT TO ME IS OF SHOULD BE THE CORE OF THIS NEW DEPARTMENT OF CONSOLIDATING THIS NEW DEPARTMENT- SO I'D LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S REATER FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND LEADERSHIP AND- THAT. BOTH LABOR AND BUSINESS AND OTHERS ARE. PORTABLE THIS THAT'S A GOOD SIGN UP TO SEE THAT SO- JUST A FEW OF MY COMMENTS- SENATORS YES CENTER NEWMAN PLEASE- TO THANK HIM OUT OF HERE SO- AS IT HAPPENS I ACTUALLY HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE SENATE. REPRESENT OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND IT- MISTER ENRIGHT HAD SOME VERSION THIS CONVERSATION SO I WANT TO- REAFFIRM I THINK YOU'VE MADE A VERY CLEAR AND ARTICULATE SUMMARY OF THE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES TO BE SOLVED- I HAVE SOME. THE FAIRLY DEEP EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH VETERANS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO BEING ELECTED. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THERE IF THERE ARE TOO MANY INPUTS- YOU HAVE TOO MANY ENTITIES THAT WORKING AT CROSS PURPOSES IN SOME CASES. WELL COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER AT THE EXPENSE OF- EITHER AN EMPLOYER A JOB SEEKER FINDING THOSE PPORTUNITIES AND PATHWAYS TO MAKE THEIR WAY- AND SO I APPLAUD YOU MISTER RANEY FOR MAKING THIS EFFORT I THINK CLEARLY THERE IS A PROBLEM NEEDING SOLVING- IN THIS IS A FIRST ABOUT AND I FEEL KIND OF WEIRD SAYING THIS BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY- I THINK THIS IS A TERRIBLE NAME FOR IT APART. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S COME UP AND BUT YOU KNOW IT INFORMED LIKE THIS BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES- I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO PUT IT BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE OFFICE AND I WORRY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS ARE RECEIVED AND SO I WOULD URGE. ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH THE ACRONYM THE DB T. H. W. IS RUNNING ON A LITTLE BIT RIGHT SO THAT LAST NIGHT- HANDICAP ANOTHER WAS VERY. ADMIRABLE EFFORT WITH A LESS THAN IDEAL NAME. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NO CALMENT WE WILL IN AS GOOD A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RESPOND TO THAT OKAY- ANY SENATE CENTER GROVE PLEASE. HER TO REGAIN MY COMPOSURE THERE JUST THAT I. THIS POINT WELL TAKEN I AM SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I DO FIND MYSELF SIDING WITH THE DIFFERENT WITH THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE BECAUSE I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT IF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALIGNED AT THE TOP IS IT GOING TO ACTUALLY FILTER DOWN AND AFFECT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE IN A CONSTITUENTS COME IN AND- YOU KNOW. FILE FOR THE SERVICES. IT IT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD THAT YOU'RE ORGANIZED AT THE TOP BUT IF IT DOESN'T FILTER DOWN TO THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO. APPLYING FOR THESE BENEFITS IN THESE PROGRAMS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL. AND ON THE- ABOUT BDD OFFICE AND IN REMOVING. OR MOVING WHAT WAS IT FOURTEEN HUNDRED OR SIXTEEN HUNDREDS. STAFF I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH THE NEW DIRECTOR OR THE NEW AT THE PERSON. I THINK IT'S A DIRECTOR TITLE OVER THE EDT. AND I FINALLY THINK WE HAVE SOME VERY STRONG LEADERSHIP THERE THAT COULD POSSIBLY HELP CLEAN UP THIS DISASTER. THAT ALL OF US AS- LEGISLATORS ARE DEALING WITH. I MEAN I KNOW IN MY AREA. IT'S THE NUMBER ONE PHONE CALL COMING INTO MY OFFICE IS THAT. A DELAYED BENEFITS THE BACK LIKE IF IT IF IT'S THE FRAUD AND BENEFITS AND- EVERYTHING SO. I WOULD OT LIKE AGAIN AGREEING WITH THE- L. A. OZARK. I WOULD NOT LIKE THIS BRAND NEW ADMINISTRATOR.A DIRECTOR- THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN CHARGE THAT I THINK HAS THE- GIFTS AND TALENTS. TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSITIONING SIXTEEN HUNDRED. MEMBERS OUR STAFF. TO A NEW. WHEN YOU CALL IT SIR JOBS. WAS A CALLED. D. B. W. DVJ W. W. AND I WOULD REALLY TO KNOW. I I'D LIKE YOU TO EXPAND ON IT BECAUSE I DO HAVE A CONCERN OF THE L. A. AS OFFICE. THAT I JUST HUGE CONCERNS. THANK YOU MISTER RAINY. YES THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTION SENATOR- IT WILL FILTER DOWN ACT THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK WAS- THAT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE NOT ALIGNED TO THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND WE'VE AS I SAID BEFORE WE DID WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE YEARS TO IMPROVE- THE ALIGNMENT AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND PUT A LOT OF ONUS ON LOCAL AGENCIES TO GET THAT DONE. AND REALIZE IF WE DON'T DO THAT ALIGNMENT IN SACRAMENTO WE DON'T WALK THE TALK WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET SO THEY'LL DO THE ALIGNMENT NEEDED AT THE POINT OF SERVICE DELIVERY- SO WE KIND OF REVERSE ENGINEER THAT AT SOME POINT TO DEAL WITH THE ALIGNMENT HERE TAKE ON OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT- HOPEFULLY WORK WITH CONGRESS TO DO THE SAME THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO THAT THE STRINGS ATTACHED TO THESE PROGRAMS AND FUNDS. ARE EITHER REMOVED OR LINED AND LESS BUREAUCRATIC TICK TICK TO CREATE THAT ACCESS IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN- I CAN ACT ON THE SECOND POINT. I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ABOUT DIRECTOR SIGNS- THE INCREDIBLY TALENTED- GREAT LEADERSHIP- AND WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH DIRECTOR-SCIENCE WILL CONTINUE TO WHICH IS ALSO ON THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- TO ENSURE THAT WE ALLOW HER ALL OF THE TIME. AND ENERGY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE'S THAT SHE IS ADDRESSING NOW- AND FOCUS THE WORK FOR STUFF. THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT CONSOLIDATION- SEPARATELY SO THAT IT ALSO GETS THE ATTENTION IT NEEDS SO THAT WORKERS CAN GET THE ATTENTION THEY NEED THE SUPPORT BUSINESSES CAN ALSO SO I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU- YOUR ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTOR SCIENCE I THANK YOU FOR THE PER. OF HER LAST NAME I WAS GONNA. RE IT BUT I ABOUT WOULD BE COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE BUT I WASN'T SURE HOW TO. PRONOUNCE HER LAST NAME- YES I AGREE WITH YOU I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH HER. BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME I MEAN LET'S GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR UP THE BACKLOG SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL WAITING THERE'S OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. THAT ARE STILL WAITING FOR BENEFITS AND I KNOW EDT IS THE NEXT- ITEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE UP WHICH I THREE I'M SURE WILL BE LEGALLY. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT. I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HER FOCUS BEING TAKEN OFF OF. AT A GETTING BENEFITS OUT THE DOOR. VALID BENEFITS OUT THE DOOR. AND VALLEY BENEFITS OUT THE DOOR TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE DESPERATELY STILL WAITING FOR THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU SENATOR- DOES- FINANCE ONE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE SENATORS- QUESTIONS. OR ADD. HI MARC BERMAN OF THE PERMANENT FINANCE I'M JUST ANTED TO REITERATE THAT I'VE JUST ABOUT WHAT KIND OF MISTER SIMMERING YOU HAD- DESCRIBE- WE DON'T ANTICIPATE I'VE THAT IMPACTS TO EDT IF ANYTHING WE HOPE THAT THESE EFFICIENCIES PAWLOWSKI WHO ARE FOCUSED ON DEPLOYING- VALUE I BENEFITS AND- AND OTHER SERVICES AND A LOT OF THE WORK FORCE I SYSTEMS TO ALSO. OPERATE EFFICIENTLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL FIX LEARN MORE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON A COLLEAGUES THEN WE WILL MOVE ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. HERE HE SUGGESTED A QUICK COM IN SUPPORT OF. MR RAINEY'S RESPONSE SO WE ARE WE DO HAVE TO SOLVE THE E. D. CRISIS AND RIGHT AND I THINK THE- DIRECTOR SIGNS AND NINETY FIRST BUNCH OTHERS ARE DOING THAT. BUT LONGER TERM IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A ZERO SUM PROPOSITION A AND I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH WITH THE ASSERTION THAT MOVING FORWARD WE SHOULD GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN SEPARATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FROM BENEFITS- IN A WAY THAT SERVES BOTH GOALS. WELL BUT YOU KNOW AS WE WORK THROUGH THE CURRENT CRISIS LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND. THANK YOU. YEP GOOD POINT THANK YOU FOR MUCH. NEWMAN ALL RIGHT WE MOVE ON THEN TO- ISSUE TWELVE- FIFTH. SCHOOL WILL PRESENT ON ISSUE. TWELVE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM CALEB HORRELL CHIEF OF THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM DIVISION FOR THE IMPLANT. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT TE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET REQUEST. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO MAKE THE FIRST INTEREST PAYMENT ON A FEDERAL LOAN THE STATE RECEIVED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PAYING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS AFTER THE U. I. FUND BECAME INSOLVENT AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. WHEN THE STATE'S YOU I TRUST FUND BECOMES INSOLVENT THE STATE IS STILL OBLIGATED BY FEDERAL LAW TO PAY BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE WORKERS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION BEGINNING IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINE THE SUBSTITUTING A LOAN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO KEEP UP. WITH PAYING BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE WORKERS. WE RECOGNIZE AND AS LA- NOTES IN THERE RIGHT UP. THAT THE INITIAL ESTIMATE WHICH WAS PREDICATED ON A FAIRLY PESSIMISTIC ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. AND DID NOT INCLUDE RECENT LOAN INTEREST FORGIVENESS THAT WAS PASSED. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY- WILL BE LOWER COME SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN THE PAYMENT IS ALTERNATELY DO- ADDITIONALLY IT'S ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CAL THE NINETEEN RELIEF PACKAGE. THAT IS MAKING ITS WAY TO FEDERAL LEVEL DOES CONTAIN FURTHER INTEREST RELIEF FOR STATE- THROUGH THE END OF AUGUST WHICH COULD ULTIMATELY MEAN ONLY ONE MONTH OF BORROWING. IN THE FIRST YEAR FOR STATES- THE DEPARTMENT WILL UPDATE THE ESTIMATED LOAN INTEREST AMOUNT AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S NEAR VISION. AND WE FURTHER UPDATED BASED ON PROPOSED BUDGET LANGUAGES THE PAYMENT DATE GETS NEAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST AND I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM EDT. ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT WAS. THE EIGHT L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENTS. S. CHANNEL WITH THE L. A. L- THROUGH MINDFUL THAT THE LANDSCAPE ISSUES SHIFTING HERE AS MR HORRELL MENTION GIVEN- POTENTIAL FEDERAL CHANGES AND I FEDERAL CHANGE THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPED THIS ESTIMATE IN PARTICULAR ON THE TWO POINTS THAT WERE RAISED BY MISTER CORAL FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INTEREST PAYMENT. IS BASED ON WHAT IS NOW OUTDATED ECONOMIC INFORMATION AND SECONDLY THAT THE INTEREST WAIVER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED TO MARCH FIFTEENTH TAKING THOSE TWO PIECES INTO ACCOUNT OUR OFFICE ESTIMATES. THAT THE INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE COMING IN SEPTEMBER WILL BE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A PROVISION OF FEDERAL LAW WHICH WILL ALLOW THE STATE GIVEN ITS HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE LAST YEAR TO DEFER A PORTION OF THIS UPCOMING INTEREST PAYMENTS COULD TO FOR THREE QUARTERS OF THE UPCOMING PAYMENT. AND PAY EACH OF THOSE. ON PAY A PORTION OF THE TO. IN EACH OF THE THREE SUBSEQUENT YEARS- AND THERE'S NO FISCAL PENALTY FOR THE STATE FOR DOING THIS I AM SO WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE THIS TIME TO ADOPT A SMALLER BUDGET AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND ADDITIONALLY- PURSUE THE INTEREST DEFERRAL TAKING BOTH THOSE ACTIONS TOGETHER. I WOULD WE ESTIMATE. RESULT IN INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ON MINDFUL OF THESE ESTIMATES AS MISTER WORLD MENTIONED OUR OFFICE WILL BE LOOKING AGAIN AT THESE NUMBERS AS WELL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION HELLO WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ASPECTS OF INTAKE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT MIGHT EXPECT THESE NUMBERS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SORRY IS THERE ANYONE FROM ET DE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. COMMENT NO I'M SORRY- SENATE CALL FINANCE OKAY SO FINANCE. THERE WAS A TV. EARLIER I ALOMAR COMMANDERS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT WE WILL BE UPDATING THE SPEAKERS IN THE MAY REVISE WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT ON THE L. A. L.

THESE QUESTIONS THAT HE WANTS WITH US ARE NOT RELATED TO THE LETTER THEIR SEPARATE THE LETTER BUT HE ASKED ME TO SUBMIT THE LETTER BASED ON WHAT THE AUDITOR HAD SAID AND I THINK ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE READ THAT- AUDITOR'S LETTER BECAUSE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUES GOING ON WITH EDT LIKE I SAID EARLIER IT'S THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT COMES INTO THE OFFICE. IS IT SENATOR NELSON LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS THAT- EDT- INDIVIDUALS CALL OUR OFFICES REGARDING ET DE IN THE AT AND TRY TO GET US TO SYSTEM THE COMPLAINTS. PATH IS AVAILABLE FOR EDT CALL CENTERS FOR STAFF TO ESCALATE MORE DIFFICULT CLAIMS AND MOVE MORE EXPERIENCED A TO MORE EXPERIENCE ET STAFF. AS I GUESS THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT- WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE WHO WAS INITIALLY DENIED THEY CALL OUR OFFICE OR WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN A BACKLOG FOR THEIR BUT THEIR EDT BENEFITS HAVE BEEN DELAYED THEY CALL THE OFFICE AND- WE DON'T MIND I MEAN HELPING WITH EDT ISSUES. THAT'S PART OF OUR JOB THAT'S WHY WE HAVE FIELD REPRESENTATIVES AND STAFF TO HELP BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT AS SENATOR NIELSEN HAS IS THAT- THERE'S- NOT VERY MANY PHONE CALLS BEING RETURNED. THAT PEOPLE DON'T HEAR RESPONSES BACK- SOME OF THEM SINCE JANUARY SECOND AND PREVIOUS TO THAT. DECEMBER IN THE DECEMBER TIME FRAME- CALLS ARE BEING RETURNED. IN SO THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE ABOUT HOW OFTEN DOES HE CALL CENTER STAFF. AT THE THREE THIRTY JUST IN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE MATTER WHICH INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED DISSEMINATED TO STAFF. IN THE DEPARTMENT TRACK THE CALL CENTER STAFF RESOLUTIONS IN CASES BECAUSE- IT APPEARS TO US AS LEGISLATORS THE RESOLUTIONS FOR CLAIMS ARE NOT BEING DEALT WITH. AND IS THE DEPARTMENT GATHERING ANY DATA RELATED TO COMMON QUESTIONS. TEN MAKING STAFF- MORE PROPERLY TRAINED AND BEST PRACTICES SO THAT COMMON AT QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ASKED BY CONSTITUENTS BUT WE- ANSWERED THE SAME WAY- BASICALLY FROM DDD STEPHENS. GETTING A DIFFERENT ANSWER EVERY TIME. HIS BIGGEST WAS CENTER GROVE- I CAN APPRECIATE ALL THE TO- RELATED. TO ADD. WORLDBUILDING WITH WITH I WAS HOPING WE- FOCUS ON THE PARTICULAR. ISSUE THAT'S BEING PRESENTED AND HOW DO WE THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M TRYING TO THINK OF THE WAY TO. ANSWER THOSE GET ANSWERS FOR YOU. BUT THEN HI THE STAY FOCUSED HERE ON THE ISSUE OF THIS INTEREST INTEREST PAYMENT YEAH. AND HERE VERY MENTION AND I AM LIKE I SAID DOING A SERVICE TO MY COLLEAGUE THE ENERGY THIS LET. AND I WILL HONOR YOUR- YOUR- SO WE COULD. GET THAT SOMEHOW. RESPONSE RESPONSES FROM- EDT TO SENATOR. QUESTIONS BUT TODAY WE COULD HEAR- FOCUS MORE ON ISSUES OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS AND HOW MUCH THE INTEREST PAYMENT WOULD BE. THAT MAKES SENSE ABSOLUTELY I THINK YOU. THANK YOU- MISSY WHO IS GOING TO LIVE THERE ANYMORE. COMMENTS NO OKAY WELL I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO PAY OUT AS LITTLE AS WE HAVE TO WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD GOOD NEWS THERE ON ON THAT FRONT- WE'RE NOT OUT OF TROUBLE OF FOR SURE BECAUSE WE STILL OWE A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT- AT LEAST WITH REGARDS TO THE INTEREST PAYMENT I THINK. THE BETTER NEWS- OKAY. IF THERE'S NO MORE. MY CALL. THEN WILL MOVE. TO ISSUE THIRTEEN PLEASE. MORNING HI KATIE HAGEN DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR RELATIONS- MORNING SENATORS- THIS THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE THE FREE TODAY RESTORATION ENHANCEMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SAFETY AND HEALTH PROGRAM- THIS REQUEST- BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WILL OFFER RATES UPTO SEVENTY PHYSICIANS AND- FOURTEEN MILLION FOUR- FROM THE- OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH FUND. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION I'M GOING TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL STAFF SHORTAGE OF INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST AND SAFETY ENGINEERS THAT HELLO SHOT- AS OUTLINED IN THE B. C. P. WE HAD- INDEPENDENT STUDY IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL NEED FOR AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT. ADDITIONAL POSITIONS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S TAKING THESE STUDY RESULTS UNDER ADVISEMENT- AND WE PLANNED TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL POSITIONS I'M IN IT IN FUTURE YEARS- THE BOTTOM THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IDENTIFIED IN THAT STUDY- SUPPORTED FUNDING- CALIFORNIA STATE PLAN- BY FEDERAL OSHA. WHICH WOULD BRING IT TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY DEFINE AS AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE AS THE THIRD LANGUAGE- OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM SO. SO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY- SUPPORTS THE FEDERAL OSHA- PLAN REQUIREMENTS. AND I'M ONE I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE STUDY HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKS PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND- I- IT WAS FINE. I THINK A MONTH AFTER SORT OF- HE WAS IN A OF YEAR. SO THE IMPACT OF THAT CAN WAS CONSIDERED IT WAS THE NEED WAS THERE EVEN PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF COVERT NINETEEN I'M IN AS MANY OF YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE CAL OSHA HAS LONG BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CRITICISM FOR NOT HAVING. SUFFICIENT STAFF TO DELIVER ITS CORE FUNCTION OF PROVIDING HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ACROSS- OCCUPATIONS. AND INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF- THAT KELLER SHOULD HAVE SPACED OVER SEVERAL YEARS MANY YEARS. WITH STAFFING SPECIFICALLY- AND WE ADDED SOME VERY KEY LANGUAGE IN THAT- BUDGET PROPOSAL REFERENCING- I PLAN TO WORK WITH CALLIE JAR- IN THE FUTURE. TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ARMS HARD CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE USE- AT SPECIFICALLY THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST AND IT'S SALARY RANGE- THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORY THERE ON THE YA- AREN'T WE HAD- THANKS A HUNDRED PER. I TRY OF OUR DOES HER HI JOE OVER THE LAST YEARS WE DO HAVE- INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS THAT WORK FOR CAL OSHA BUT THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION- AND I BECAUSE THE SALARY OF THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS JUST WASN'T. ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH IN OUR HIGH JENIS OPTED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER CLASSIFICATION- SO WE DON'T WANT HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF AND- I BE UNABLE TO RETAIN- THESE VERY HECTIC. PERSONNEL AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR WORKFORCE- SO WE HAVE PLANS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SORT OF. THE- TOP END UP THE PAY SCALE THAT WOULD WOULD BE IMPORTANT AND RETAINING STAFF. SO FAR I'VE BEEN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TRACK- THREE FIX STAFF INTO THE INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST. CLASSIFICATION AS WELL AS OUR SAFETY ENGINEER CLASSES ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE BEEN- ABLE TO HIRE- I THINK LAST WEEK WHEN I LOOKED WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY- STAFF THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE HIGHER OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS- AND- WE STILL HAVEAPPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE- ENFORCEMENT VACANCIES THAT WE NEED TO FILL IN CALIFORNIA- AND THOSE ARE ALL UNDER WAY- AT SOME POINT IN THE- THE HIRING PIPELINE- TO FILL THOSE. WE ARE GETTING A FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE TURNING US DOWN BUT- BUT OVERALL WE'VE WE- ARE DOING WELL WITH OUR RECRUITMENT. AND IN ADDITION TO THE RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES ISSUE PROBABLY AWARE THE DEPARTMENTS HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF- IT'S LOSS OF HIGH. US HAVE SOME GOOD ON THAT FRONT THAT- WERE BEING HEARD NEXT WEEK AT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD. I'M CONSIDERING OUR PETITION TO REQUEST RETURN OF OUR HIRING AUTHORITY SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL SOON BE RESTORED FOR THE DEPARTMENTS. AND AS PART OF THAT RETURN OF A STORY WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON ESTABLISHING ALL NEW EXAMINATIONS THAT ARE ONLINE- AND AVAILABLE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. TO ANY INTERESTED CLASS PARTY TO APPLY FOR JOBS. WE PUT TOGETHER AN ASIAN WIDE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS- FOR SAFETY ENGINEERS A HYGIENIST AND- A NUMBER OF OUR SPORT POSITIONS ATTORNEYS LEADERSHIP- NOT AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO. THAT IN IT TO ALL OF THE RECRUITING AND HIGHER EFFORTS AND THE SALARY- REVIEW THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. I WE REALLY NEED TO- BALANCE SERVING THE CONSTITUENTS OF CALIFORNIA. I AND CAN YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT WORK WITH WEEK CONDUCTING HIRING INTERVIEWS AND- YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE SAME SUPERVISORS THAT ARE REVIEWING ALL OF OUR CITATIONS PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO. INDUSTRIES SO- IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE BUT ONE THAT WE ARE TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY WE HAVE A WEEKLY PROJECT MANAGEMENT MEETINGS HELLO STAFF TALK DAILY ABOUT HIRING FOCUS- SO WE'RE SO WE- ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO FILL THOSE REMAINING FORTY FIVE ENFORCEMENT VACANCIES VERY SAM. WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF. FIVE HI THERE- COUNTRY POP THE FARM OF FINANCE- OKAY WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ADVERTISEMENT AGAIN HAVING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY AND THE A. O. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE A. R. WE NOTICED CONCERNS A PROPOSED- TO POINT OUT IT'S A MALL YEAR- SO BE CONTINUING THIS AND THE FUTURE AND TO WORK WITH A AND TO A SORT OF FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE OF. QUESTIONS ONE IS- GIVEN THAT ONLY FIVE POINT 5% OF COVERT NINETEEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT WERE INSPECTED. HOW ARE WE NOT CAN YOU EXPLAIN. I KNOW YOU TOUCHED ON IT BUT HOW COME WE'RE NOT MAKING OR HOW DO WE MAKE ADDITIONAL PROGRESS TOWARDS REACHING THE BENCHMARK WHAT IS IT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT- ADDITIONAL HIGH GENEST AND THIRTY NINE ADDITIONAL WHAT IS THE S. E. SAFETY YES. OF EVERY WORD WE WON'T WE WON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO FIVE POINT 5% OF THE KOBE COMPLAINTS- INSPECT THEM SO. HOW DO WE MOVE FASTER TOWARDS WHO REALLY WERE THE BENCHMARK WE SUPPOSED TO BE. I'M I THINK I MAY ASK MY COLLEAGUE DOUG PARKER TO HELP- RESPOND TO THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS. ODD THAT THE 5% OF THE COATED- RESPONSES I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN A STAFFING ISSUE- BUT I DON'T KNOW DONE DO YOU HAVE- ANY INSIGHT TO SHARE WITH THE PANEL. I CAN'T THANK YOU SENATOR- LOS TO. AS AS- AS AS WE DISCUSSED IN PRIOR HEARINGS YOU KNOW CAL OSHA HAS HAD A VERY HIGH VOLUME OF WORKLOAD PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO- CODE NINETEEN COMPLAINTS. THIS YEAR- YET TO DATE SINCE FEBRUARY WE'VE HAD TWELVE THOUSAND TO ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND COVERT NINETEEN RELATED COMPLAINTS ARE THAT'S TYPICALLY NO MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF WORKER COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET FOR ALL REASONS IN THE COURSE OF A TYPICAL YEAR. AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW REFLECTS. THE- JUST THE- DOUBLE WORK THAT THAT COVER NINETEEN ROCK. I RECOGNIZE THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT DRESSED NOT JUST BECOME BUT OUR TO INVESTIGATE OUTBREAKS TO INVESTIGATE SERIOUS ILLNESSES AND TO INVESTIGATE THE TECHNOLOGIES. WE PUT IN PLACE A TRIAGE SYSTEM IN WHICH WE- IT INITIAL EVALUATIONS OF- OF COVERT NINETEEN COMPLAINTS THROUGH WHATEVER A REMOTE INVESTING PROCESS USING A LETTER AND USING PHONE CONTACT EMPLOYERS AND CHECK WITH WORKERS TO DETERMINE IF ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED AND- I MAKE NO- REPRESENT. THAT THAT'S- EQUIVALENT TO AN IN PERSON INVESTIGATION IT WOULD CLEARLY BE BETTER IF WE COULD DO MORE IN PERSON INVESTIGATIONS AND WE ARE WORKING A NUMBER OF ANGLES TO DO THAT- INCLUDING YES WORKING ON HOW WE CAN SIMPLIFY OUR- OUR- YOU KNOW OUR INSPECTION EFFORTS WERE WERE ACTUALLY ALSO- YEAH- WORK ON- ON ON THAT'S NOT AS AS WE SEE- BUT YOU KNOW RECOGNIZED THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS VERY YES I CHALLENGES- AND WE PUT THE TRIAGE METHOD IN PLACE AND WE STILL GO OUT AND CONDUCT. INSPECTIONS ON- ON ON COMPLAINTS WHERE IT'S AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS COMPLAINT- WHERE IT- IS COMBINED WITH AN ILLNESS WHERE THERE'S AN OUTBREAK OR WHERE THE EMPLOYER% DOESN'T STATUS YOU KNOW GIVE US A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARD A MUCH BETTER YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE A MUCH BETTER RATIO. OF COMPLAINTS WERE IN THE PROCESS OF- THAT'S GOING BACK IN AND RE INVESTIGATING SOME OF THOSE. COMPLAINTS AS A COMPLIANCE CHECK TO SEE THAT EMPLOYERS DID IN FACT DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO AS A RESULT OF OUR REMOTE INVESTIGATIONS- SO- AND AT AND WHILE WE ONLY- WHAT WE'VE ONLY DONE FIVE. OF THOSE COMPLAIN. WE DO HAVE AN- HIGH NUMBER OF FATALITIES AND- AND OF COURSE OUTBREAKS THAT WE'VE HAD TO INVESTIGATE. IT THIS YEAR AND- SO THOSE INSPECTION RESOURCES HAVE BEEN KIND OF REALLOCATED FROM COMPLAINTS TO. THE VERY IMPORTANT NEED TO INVESTIGATE WORKER DEATHS. OKAY WELL HOW OBVIOUSLY ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVERT NINETEEN. YOUR WORK ON YOUR DEPARTMENTS WORK IS SO CRITICAL BERMAN HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH. WHAT THEN HAPPENS OF WITH THOSE EMPLOYEES. WHEN THEY GO HOME AND THE SPREAD THAT IT DOES TO THE TO THE FAMILY I KNOW I READ RECENTLY A STATISTIC ABOUT- IN ORDER FOR ITS JUST A LOS ANGELES BUT- OF THE- PERCENTAGE OF MULTIPLE EARNERS WITHIN A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD. UP WAS DOUBLE THAT OF ANY OTHER COMMUNITY AND- SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR EXPOSURE WHEN YOU GET MULTIPLE EARNERS OUT ON THE JOBS AND THEN COMING HOME THAT THAT EXPOSURE REALLY I BELIEVE. IS PART OF THE ISSUE THAT HAS LED TO SUCH DOUBLE AND TRIPLE NUMBER OF CASES AND DEATHS- SO THERE'S A- DIRECT CONNECTION I HAVE IMPROVED IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS. AND HEALTH PROTOCOLS AND OF THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THEIR AND THEIR COMMUNITIES SO. YOUR WORK. HIS SOUL FOR CRITICAL AND SOME POINTED ENTIRE- SENATE YES SENATOR COURTESY THANK YOU A MEASURE JUST HAVE A QUICK THAT IS JUST BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF IT- THE HIRING THE- ISSUE WITH HIRING GO THROUGH. DEAL WHAT HOW HAS THAT BEEN THE CASE OR IF I'M JUST LOOKING FOR THE TO ME VERSION OF- THE HIS OF THAT IF YOU IF SOMEBODY CAN THAT FOR ME. I CAME HAGAN I PART OF INVESTOR RELAY- HIRING AUTHORITY WEST LAW- IT'S BEEN A- APPROXIMATELY TWO. AGO NOW- AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT OF- ILLEGAL. PRACTICES BY PRAIRIE- AND- B. R. SO DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR YES YOU BE THE STAND OUT MORE YOU BE THE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU FOR MUCH. THE HIGHER PER. GOING BACK OF YEARS TO THE PRO MINISTRY I THINK WAS THE ANSWER. IS THAT CORRECT. PRACTICE RIGHT. YEAH I CAN. LEARN ABOUT THAT OFFLINE IJUST WANT TO KNOW FOR THANK YOU. TRUMP OKAY SANDERS SENATOR- NO MORE OKAY THANK YOU MCH. FOR ALL OF TWO ISSUE FOR. EARNED- BERMAN FOR SPECIAL APPAREL. COULD THE DEPARTMENT PRESENT PLEASE. I THINK YOU AND I'M GONNA DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUE LABOR A LITTLE YOUNGER BROWER TO ENTER THIS. AS REFLECTED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR THE APPROPRIATION OF GENERAL FUND MONIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS ALSO APPROVED TO ALLOW FOR FUND TRANSFERS TO THE GARMENT ON AS NEEDED. HAS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY ALL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AS WELL AS ALL CAN BE ORDERED FOR FIFTY FOUR REFERRAL BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW TODAY. A YES TECHNICALLY FUND CONSIDERED IS CONSIDERED TO BE INSOLVENT IN THAT THE PENDING REFERRAL BOTH EXCEED AVAILABLE CASH AND PROJECTED REVENUES INTO THE FUND. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR AND BEYOND. AS OF FEBRUARY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WAS ONE POINT THREE SEVEN NINE MILLION IN THE FUNDS COMPARED TO THE EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION CLAIMS PENDING FOR REFERRAL AND CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW. THERE'S APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION IN THE UNPAID WORKER FUND WHICH WILL BE PROCESSED FOR TRANSFERRED TO THE FUND PURSUANT TO THE TWENTY TWENTY PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. THERE ARE A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE CLAIMS FOR THE AMOUNT OF EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION. I CAN GO THROUGH THAT DETAIL THAT TOTAL EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION CAPTURES INDIVIDUAL GARMENT CLAIMS ABOUT SEVENTY THREE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. AND IT ALSO CAPTURES CLEAVES FROM OUR GARMENTS- FROM OUR BUREAU OF FIELD FORCE MEN ARE FIELD. THAT TOTALS THAT HE WENT TO. THANK YOU I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. OKAY SO THE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE FIRST TIME I. REALLY ENCOUNTERED THIS THIS ISSUE OF I'M SORRY I ACTUALLY I SHOULD GET- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN LA- AND THEN I'LL ASK A QUESTION. THE FIRM FINANCE. FIVE HUNDRED W. BARBARA FINANCE- BECAUSE APPARENTLY INFORMATIONAL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS- BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AND ALEJO. AS I DON'T KNOW WITH THE AUDIO- THE SAME OKAY OKAY THAT'LL MAKE MY COMMENTS SO COUPLE YEARS AGO- WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE- EVEN. PAID ATTENTION A NEW THAT THIS SPECIAL FUND EXISTED- BECAUSE THERE WAS TESTIMONY FROM SOME GARMENT WORKERS WHO CAME HERE TO THE CAPITAL. AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER TESTIFIED THAT THEIR CLAIMS HAD ALREADY BEEN. A FINALIZED BONTA THE PROCESS AND THE AWARD WAS GIVEN AS TO HOW MUCH WAS OWED TO THEM AND IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS. THAT EVEN AFTER THAT CLAIM HAD BEEN DECIDED THAT THEY STILL WEREN'T PAID. AND WE WEREN'T MOVING THE FUNDING BUT THEN AS IT TURNS OUT THIS RESTITUTION FUND WASN'T ENOUGH MONEY SO WE WERE HAVING TO MOVE MORE MONEY INTO THAT FUND TO BE ABLE TO PAY THESE CLAIMS- AND I WAS PRETTY. SURPRISED BY THIS FIRST OF ALL THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CLAIMS. THAT THE RESTITUTION FUND DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THEM AND THEN SECOND THAT THESE WORKERS WERE. WAITING YEARS. TO GET- SOME PORTION OR ALL HOPEFULLY ALL OF THE MONEY THAT'S OWED TO THEM AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY REACH GOING TO GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AT AT AT THE MOST- AND IT WAS QUITE SHOCKING UNITED TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH AND- SO WE TRY TO MOVE TO GET THE MONEY INTO THAT FUND SO I COULD AT LEAST THEY COULD- THEY COULD GET THEIR OWN. AWARDS ON PAID- AND A FEW MONTHS LATER I WAS THAT- YOU KNOW SPOKE TO THEM AGAIN AND SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE PAYING SOMEONE HAD NOT IT'S A- UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. BUT I THINK AT THE HEART OF IT IS. THAT THE- THERE'S THIS BACKLOG OF UNPAID GARMENT WORKER- WAGE CLAIMS. AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE RESTITUTION FUND SO WE KEEP HAVING TO REPLENISH. THE RESTITUTION FUND- BECAUSE THAT THE CLAIMS ARE STILL THERE SO MANY CLAIMS- HI WHAT. WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND OR DO YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW WE- ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE- IT SEEMS LIKE A CRAZY CYCLE. WITH THE WORKERS. GO TO WORK YOU DON'T GET PAID. IS WAGE THEFT CLAIMS IT'S THE ADJUDICATED ITSELF PROCESS. AND THEY STILL DON'T GET PAID SO YOU KNOW THEY DON'T GET PAID FROM THE EMPLOYER WHO'S PROBABLY. CLOSED DOWN. AND MOVED DOWN THE BLOCK AND THEN. YOU HAVE OF. THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOVER EVEN FROM OUR OUR STATE FUNDS SO. WHAT WHAT. WHAT CAN YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE DO. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR- AS YOU WELL KNOW I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND I TOO WAS SHOCKED- BYE AS I LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION IN PARTICULAR TO THE GARMENT INDUSTRY- AND I THINK THERE ARE TWO PIECES I WOULD CAP OR POSSIBLY THREE WAYS I WOULD CATEGORIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PARTNER FOR US THE LAST COUPLE YEARS PART OF THE BACKLOG USE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VACANCY RATE AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH POSITIONS AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES INDULGE AND SO WE ARE MOVING FORWARD- WITH THE STRONG EFFORT LED BY OUR DIRECTOR IN FULL CYLLENE SIGNIFICANT BEACON C. STAND THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND THAT IS A STRATEGIES VERY SPECIFIC CORRELATION TO THE BACKLOG OF THE GARMENT CLAIMS- THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE OF REACHING WORKERS AND HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS SEES THAT THE STATE HAS THAT ARE NOT VERY FLEXIBLE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS TO COMPLY WITH SO WE DID LAUNCH AN AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THIS PAST AUGUST TO REACH DISTRICTS ESPECIALLY WORKERS WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND WE KNOW THAT THE POPULATION OF THE GARMENT INDUSTRY ARE IN FACT THOSE EXACT WORKERS THAT WE NEED TO REACH WE HAVE WORKING CLOSLY WITH PARTNERS LIKE THE GARMENT WORKER CENTER AND BAD STATIC IN THE UCLA UCLA. LABOR CENTER. PRIESTS ARE OUT WE WITH. INCREASED SCENES MEDIA SO THAT THEY CAN. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST WAGE THEFT AND RETALIATION. AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEM ABOUT THE- PURSUING WAGES. AGAINST THE RESTITUTION FUND WHAT IS THAT PROCESS AND WE'RE WORKING ON DEVELOPING MATERIAL THAT PROVIDES A FLOW CHART THAT IS MUCH MORE CLEAR FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE PAYMENT FROM THE RESTITUTION FUND. AND THE LAST PIECE I'D LIKE TO- HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE HAVE S. REESTABLISHED OUR GARMENTS- FIELD ENFORCEMENT UNIT- AND THAT UNIT WAS PREVIOUSLY DISBANDED- AND WE ARE NOW BRINGING THAT UNIT BACK IN EXACTLY BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM WORKERS AND PARTNERS. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT UNIT WILL INCREASE THE OUTCOMES OF ELIMINATING BACK ACTORS AND BEING ABLE TO MAXIMIZE OUR TOOLS TO PUT HARD EARNED MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS OR THE QUESTION THAT- MEDICARE WOMAN ASKED US. IN A REPORT VIRGINIA- SKEWS ME JULY JULY A SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWENTY. YOU PROCESSED- FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT ALSO HAVE TO INNER CITY CLAIMS IN PROCESS. SINCE JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY HOW MANY CLAIMS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED. OUT OF THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO I'M INTERESTED IN NO. AND IF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE ARE STILL WAITING. OR HAVE THEY BEEN TAKING CARE OF. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME SO I CAN SHARE THAT WITH YOU. I WILL RESTATE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT ACTIVE GARMENT CLAIMS IN THE PROCESS SO THOSE ARE TWO HUNDRED EIGHT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH. THE PROCESS TO RECOVER UNPAID WAGES. M. JUST TO CLARIFY I GUESS I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD IT SO IN JULY A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY AND NOW THERE'S TWO HUNDRED EIGHT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT. DO YOU THINK THOSE ARE NEW CLAIMS OR IS THAT PART OF THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY CLAIMS THAT WERE IN JULY THAT HAD NOT BEEN PAID. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT DO YOU HAVE PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS FOR. EIGHT MONTHS TO ONLY GET SIXTY DONE. THANK YOU SENATOR OUR WAGE CLAIM ADJUDICATION UNIT IS OUR LARGEST UNIT WITHIN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WE ARE FUNDED FOR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR FULL TIME POSITIONS WE DO HAVE A 32% BEACON C. RATE WE HAVE ABOUT I RECALL I THINK TWELVE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR GARMENT ENFORCEMENT UNIT. THAT FOCUS ON THE JUDICATA MEANING GARMENT ENFORCEMENT CLAIMS TO GIVE YOU A BACKGROUND ON THIS THOSE NUMBERS OF STAFFING. IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME OF THESE CURRENT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT CASES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS FROM THOSE JULY TWO HUNDRED CASES AND OUR TEAM DOES HAVE THAT INFORMATION I JUST DO NOT HAVE IT AVAILABLE FOR YOU BUT I CAN PROVIDE YOU A DETAILED BREAKDOWN. UNFORTUNATELY AS SENATOR DID ALSO MENTIONED IT DOES TAKE- A YEAR TO TWO YEARS OF FOR A CLEAN TO WORK THROUGH OUR PROCESS AND WE SHARE THE LEGISLATURE SINCE ARMED WITH THAT WHICH IS WHY WE PURSUED SIGNIFICANT STAFFING RESOURCES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING THOSE POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. IS RIGHT BUT I ADD- ALSO ANOTHER POINT THAT WHEN I LOOKED INTO THIS ISSUE AYE- I THINK IT ADDS TO THE SORT OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITUATION AND THAT- MANY OF THE WORKERS I AND THAT YOU KNOW SUBMIT APPLICATIONS ARE WORKERS AND- OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THEY GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN SOMETIMES AND WE OFTEN LOSE CONTACT WITH THE WORKER- IN OTHER CASES IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE HESITANT TO ENGAGE- IN THE PROCESS FOR CLEANING RESTITUTION FINES- BECAUSE OF. THE WIDESPREAD PRACTICE OF BUYING- AT UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS TO USE IMMIGRATION STATUS TO INTIMIDATE WORKERS- THERE'S LOTS OF STATE PROTOCOLS- IN IN ORDER FOR US TO PAY A WAGE CLAIM WE HAVE TO HAVE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS I TI N. NUMBERS- AND OFTEN THIS GROUP OF WORKERS IS HESITANT TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO US SO THERE'S A LOT OF OBSTACLES AND THAT ADDS TO THE TIME- THAT THAT A CLAIM TAKES IN ADDITION. TO THE OTHER- I THAT THE COMMISSIONER OUTLINED JUST THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING. VERY HELPFUL DIRECTOR HAGEN THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHY NUMBER ONE RIGHT. AND YOU ANSWERED THAT SO I APPRECIATE THAT- I GUESS- WHAT YOU KNOW WHY IT TAKES SO LONG I GUESS I SHOULD'VE ELABORATE ON THAT WAY TAKES A LONG. BUT I DO HAVE- BUT I STILL HAVE A CONCERN- AND IT'S JUST MIGHT. YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOL MATH I GUESS- YOU HAVE TO EARN THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS WITH A 32% VACANCY WHICH LEAVES YOU A HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE. AND A HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE HAVE ONLY PROCESSED. SIXTY CLAIMS IN AN EIGHT MONTH. CYCLE ROUGHLY BASED ON THE MATHIS IN THIS I MEAN WHAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS RIGHT SO IF YOU WERE PROCESS INTO IF YOU HAD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY CLAIMS LEFT A PROCESS OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WAITED. PROBABLY YEARS YEARS IN MY RIGHT YEARS. EARLY YEARS FOR THEIR WAGES AND YOU SEE OF TURNER SEVENTY CLAIM STILL IN PROCESS OR IN CLASS IN PROCESS AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY YOU HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT PROCESSING THESE CLAIMS. AND YOU'RE DOWN TO TWO OH EIGHT YOU SAID WAS THE NUMBER. IN PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR- I WOULD LIKE TO JUST OF THESE ARE AT I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT I'M NOT CRITICIZING I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHY I MEAN IN THE REAL WORLD I OWN A BUSINESS AND OF MY BUSINESS OPERATED LIKE THAT I'D BE OUT OF BUSINESS SO I JUST IT FROM YOU KNOW A PERSPECTIVE OF TAKING CARE OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS- OUR GOAL. ARE YOUR DEPARTMENTS GOAL MINDER SAYS MAKE SURE THESE PEOPLE GET PAID FOR THE WAGES THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. AN AND SO I AM JUST CURIOUS ABOUT HOW COME IT TAKES. HOW COME A HUNDRED SIXTY PEOPLE CAN'T PROCESS I DON'T KNOW. TO CLAIMS EACH IN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS. THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT WE MISSED BURKE AND I CAN PROVIDE- SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR YOU ON THOSE SPECIFIC- ACTIVITIES OF THE NUMBERS YOU'RE REFERENCING I DON'T HAVE THOSE BEFORE ME TO DATE- IN GENERAL ARE AGENCY PROCESSES OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CLAIMS A YEAR. OKAY AND SO WE'RE SPECIFICALLY I'M SIMPLY REPORTING ON THOSE CLAIMS IN REFERENCE TO THE GARMENT MANUFACTURE SPECIAL ACCOUNTS. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE MUCH MORE DETAIL WITH YOU ON THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING FROM JULY TWENTY TWENTY AND EXPLAIN WHERE THEY ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS. SO THE THIRTY THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT YOU FILE ARE NOT RELATED TO THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS. THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS SPECIAL ACCOUNT CLEANS ARE PART OF THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT THE PUBLIC FILES WITH US OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU AND ANY INFORMATION- COMMISSIONER THAT- YOU HAVE I THINK WITH REGARDS TO A SENATOR GROWTH. INSTANCE ARE COMMISSION AGGRESSIVE BAR- IT BE GREAT I THINK THE SHARE WITH- WITH ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL THIS IS OUR- YES I'M SORRY CENTER CRITICIZING IF I CAN JUST HAS ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE WRAP UP IN- FOR THE COMMISSIONER. BERMAN I KNOW YOU WERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE JUDICATA OF CLAIMS IN GENERAL PROTECTING FOR THE GARMENT WORKERS POLITICAL QUESTION COULD BE GENERALISED TO THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOR ALL CLAIMS AS WELL. ONCE WE GET TO JUDICATA AND PARTICULARLY OF THESE CLAIMS THAT ARE. ON THE TABLE TODAY- WHAT HAPPENS WITH COLLECTION- WHAT X. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES YOUR- A DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY. ASSIST WITH COLLECTION OF HEARD OF ALL THE CHALLENGES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER TRANSCEND ARE MOVING AROUND AND SO FORTH- IN A AND- I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCES HAVE KERN COUNTY WITH. OF STANDING UP OUR OWN COLLECTION EFFORTS ON ON EDUCATED CLAIMS BUT I WONDER IF IT. YOU KNOW. TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATE ASSIST WITHOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR HISTORICALLY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE HAS NOT ENGAGED VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN COLLECTIONS ACTIVITIES- WE HAD A LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH F. T. B. WHERE WE WOULD REFER CASES TO FTP FOR COLLECTIONS- HOWEVER IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION SECRETARY CITU ASK COMMISSIONER DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB IN BUILDING EIGHT JUDGMENT ENFORCEMENT UNIT. THAT DID PRIORITIZE- AND INCREASED TOOLS THAT WE RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE OF FOR US TO PURSUE THE RECOVERY OF THOSE WAGES SO WE NOW HAVE A UNIT THAT FOCUSES ON BAT AND SINCE I CAME AND ASKED PERMISSION- I AM LOOKING TO EXPAND RECOVERY IS NOT SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT JUST AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WORKERS FILE CLAIMS AGAINST OPERATE IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FOLLOWING THE LAW OPERATE OUT OF THEIR TRUNKS ON THEIR CARS WORKERS DO NOT HAVE FULL INFORMATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IN OUR INDUSTRIES AND THOSE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO PURSUE SO IT'S NOT A SIMPLE COLLECTIONS. THAT ONE WOULD THINK IT'S MORE OF AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION SO WE HAVE BEEN TAKING- ADDITIONAL STEPS MORE CREATIVE STEPS LIKE FIGHT FILING FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWSUITS OF BANK LEVEES WE MOST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SHERIFF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TO PURSUE THE RECOVERY OF THE THOUSANDS OF UNPAID JUDGMENTS WE HAVE IN L. A. COUNTY IF THAT IS SUCCESSFUL WE WILL APPROACH OTHER COUNTIES TO PARTNER WITH US AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE IN DETAILED INFORMATION OF THEIR. RECENT ACTIVITIES THAT WE- EAI BE INTERESTED IN IN THE UP AND ALL SPEECH IN HEARING. YOU KNOW FOR EX. ON THE CONCUSSION ENFORCEMENT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES YOU NEED BEYOND WHAT THE LEGISLATORS RECENTLY GRANTED. I'M PRETTY SURE. CLICK HERE DRAWS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING AS WELL FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE I MEAN. GREAT IF WE GET THROUGH THE EDUCATION AND NO ONE SOUNDS LIKE I'M PREACHING OF HARD TO SAY THIS BUT GREAT IF WE GET TO THE JUDICATA IN THEIR JUDGMENTS OUT THERE. AND THEN WE HAVE FOLKS WHO. CAN'T AFFORD A LAWYER UP- THEY'RE NOT SOPHISTICATED ON THEMSELVES ON HOW TO PLACE A LIEN ON. AN EMPLOYER- OR OR A GARNISHMENT ON A- ON A BANK ACCOUNT- AND THEY NEED ASSISTANCE- I'M FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE HERO THE PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES WITH GOING AFTER CERTAIN EMPLOYERS BUT I'M ALSO. FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE PRACTICES WE PUT INTO PLACE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WITH HER OWN OFFICE OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT WHICH- WAS AN INITIATIVE THAT I CREATED DOWN THERE- WE'RE OUR ATTORNEYS ARE LEGAL COUNSEL THERE- YOU KNOW. BROUGHT BACK TO US SO A LOT MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THE THAT ARE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE IN TERMS OF- PULLING UP- HEALTH A HEALTH DEPARTMENT LICENSES FOR RESTAURANTS THAT ARE NON COMPLIANT AND SO FORTH. YOU KNOW IF THEY'VE GOT. OUTSTANDING JUDGMENTS OF HAT YOU'VE BROUGHT TO BEAR AT THIS LEVEL OF THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PAID TO THOSE WORKERS. INTO THEM AND THEN THE ISSUE BECOMES. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE THROW AT THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO. WHO ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND THEM- SHOULD THEY CONTINUE TO BE LICENSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATES TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES WHEN THEY'VE- PERHAPS SO. YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN. IN JUDGMENTS- TO THESE WORKERS SO. I'D LOVE TO HEAR.% IT'S I AM DRAW THE INFERENCE FROM YOUR COMMENTS AT THIS POINT THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. THAT KIND OF AN EXPANSION OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND WHETHER THAT IS- A MORE ROBUST OFFICE OF LABOR STANDS APPORTIONMENT WITHIN YOUR OWN OFFICE OR JUST JUST. DOLLARS AND TOOLS TO GO TO WORK ON THAT THAT'S WHAT I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING IN AND PLEASE. UNLESS SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT THAT INFORMATION I WOULD APPRECIATE IT BEING SHARED WITH THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR I LET ME JUST ADD- THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THAT PROGRAM WE DO HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH SANTA CLARA COUNTY. BOTH WITH THEIR HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEIR LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE DID ENGAGE IN AN INITIATIVE WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO RECOVER UNPAID WAGES ON JUDGMENTS FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM- DUE TO THAT INITIATIVE THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE ARE LOOKING TO. EXPAND THAT EFFORT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE COMMISSION THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK YOU OUT COMMISSIONER GARCIA BROWER AND- DIRECTOR KAGAN- VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK. UNFORTUNATELY ALL OF THIS IS WHAT INSPIRED ME TO INTRODUCE.
