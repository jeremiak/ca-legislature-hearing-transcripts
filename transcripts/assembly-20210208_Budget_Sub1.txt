ALL PUBLIC COMMENTERS I MENTIONED WILL BE TAKEN AFTER WE HAVE FINISHED THE ENGINE AND- INCLUDING THE NON PRESENTATION ISSUES. WHICH ARE ISSUES SIXTEEN SIX THROUGH SEVENTEEN. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO START IF I CAN WITH A FEW OPENING REMARKS REALLY THEIR OPENING QUESTIONS TO HELP US TO FRAME TODAY'S DISCUSSION. AND THEY WILL BE WHO WHAT WHY WHERE AND WHEN. WHO ARE WE AS THE STATE IF WE DO NOT TAKE CARE OF THE POOR THE IMMIGRANT AND THE DISABLED. BECAUSE IT IS BEYOND ME THAT CURRENTLY THE DISABLED ARE NOT INCLUDED IN TIER ONE B. WHAT DOES THE DATA CURRENTLY SAY ABOUT OUR MOST PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS RESOURCE THE COVERT NINETEEN TAXI. ARE THEY GOING CURRENTLY TO THE POOR AND HARD TO REACH OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR ARE THEY GOING TO THE WEALTHY AND THE PRIVILEGED. WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION PIVOT FROM THE INITIAL VACCINE ADMINISTRATOR TO THIS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. WAS IT BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF DATA AND TRANSPARENCY AND THUS NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY. WHERE IS THE ADMINISTRATION PIVOTING TO AND CAN WE AS THE LEGISLATURE MAKE SUGGESTIONS. AS IN INCREASING THE VACCINE SUPPLIED TO THE POOR SINCE IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE FLYING BLIND. WHEN CAN WE FINALLY ACHIEVE HEALTH JUSTICE BECAUSE FOR TOO MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT IS TAKING TOO LONG. MARTIN LUTHER KING ALMOST FIFTY YEARS AGO SAID THAT OF ALL OF THE INEQUALITIES AND JUSTICE AND HEALTH CARE IS THE MOST SHOCKING AND INHUMANE. HAVING PRACTICE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THROUGH PANDEMIC SITE. IT IS WITH JUSTICE THAT I STAND HERE AS A CHAIRED TODAY ADVOCATING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR ALL COMMUNITIES. AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTED. IT IS WITH GRATITUDE AND THANKFULNESS AND APPRECIATION AS WELL. GRATITUDE THAT WE ARE HERE IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE DO VALUE OUR IMMIGRANTS ARE POOR AND ARE DISABLED. THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE AN EYE TOWARDS EQUITY AND THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HAS OCCURRED FROM OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO OUR NURSES TO OUR DOCTORS TO EVERYONE. WHO'S HELPING DURING THIS PANDEMIC THIS HAS BEEN STRESSFUL THIS HAS BEEN HARD BUT MY TONE HERE TODAY WITH QUESTIONS IS TO MAKE US. MOVE TOWARDS EQUITY. BUT IT'S WITH HOPE. THAT I MOST TO SIT HERE TODAY. BECAUSE DURING THE PREVIOUS PANDA WHEN I WAS ON THE FRONT LINES OF HEALTH CARE TAKING CARE OF ONE PATIENT AT A TIME. I OFTENTIMES COULDN'T WORK ON THE SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED DURING PANDEMICS. BUT IT IS HOPE SITTING HERE IN THIS CHAIR THAT TOGETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT CHANGE THAT WE ALL SEEK. AND SO IT IS IN THAT THEME THAT I BEGIN TODAY SUB ONE HEARING. AND WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH PANEL ONE. OUR FIRST PANEL TODAY. WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS DR DUNCAN AND LOUIS BRONCHI.

WE HAVE FIVE BCPS THIS YEAR AND UNDERSTAND THIS HEARING WILL FOCUS ALL ON ARE CLOSELY RELATED WORK AND OUR WORKFORCE INITIATIVES. I DO WANT TO MENTION AS THE AGENDA DOES THAT THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO ADD A NEW OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. REFLECTING AN EXPANDED MISSION THE BUDGET WOULD RECAST AUSTIN INTO A DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE H. C. A. I. R. H. CHI.

AND OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL BE RELEASED SOON. I WANT TO THANK DR WHAT AND HIS STAFF FOR BOTH THE INTEREST IN AND CONVERSATIONS ON THE OFFICE. NOW TURNING TO OUR STREETS KOBE NINETEEN RELATED ACTIVITIES. LIKE ALL DEPARTMENTS IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FAMILY OPTION BUT IT'S BEEN CONTINUING. HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND SAW JUST GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES WE- HAVE BEEN ASSISTING FEMA AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AT OUR STATE PARTNERS WITH THE DESIGN AND APPROVAL OF ALTERNATE CARE SITES AND SEARCH SPACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS OUR HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN SO UNDER SIEGE. WE'VE CREATED A COVERT NINETEEN WEBSITE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL GUIDANCE AND OTHER RESOURCES FOR HEALTH FACILITIES. WE'VE ASSISTED WITH THEIR CREATE OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY DASHBOARD. FOR THE- TO TRACK VARIOUS MEASURES. REGARDING HEALTH FACILITIES SEARCH SPACE AND EQUIPMENT. WE SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTED A PRIVATE GRANT OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO STAFF WORKING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THE SKILLED NURSING HERO AWARDS WHEREBY FIFTY THOUSAND LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS WORKING IN SNAPS EACH RECEIVED A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR HERO AWARD.

AND OUTSIDE OF HER USUAL SCOPE WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FACILITY SAFETY GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOL RE OPENING. AND OTHER ISSUES AS REQUESTED. THE TERM OF OUR WERE FORCE- WE'VE DURING THE PEN WE CONTINUE TO TIMELY IMPLEMENT OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS I KNOW THERE IS INTEREST OF THE COMMITTEE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS- AND OUR EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY THE WORKFORCE. I THINK WE'VE KNOWN FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE NEEDED FURTHER DEVELOPMENT TO MEET THE STATE'S NEEDS. AND CERTAINLY COVER NINETEEN HAS SHOWN AN EVEN BRIGHTER LIGHT ON THE NEED FOR AN EXPANDED AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE WORKFORCE SO OUR PROGRAMS ARE A LONG TERM APPROACH TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE NEEDS. THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS TOWARDS WORK FORCE. AND CONTINUES GENERAL FUND AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO BRING IN PROVIDERS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND TO INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO WORK IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO THOSE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO ALLOW US TO PROVIDE DOES FOCUS ON PROVIDING THE RIGHT PROVIDERS IN THE RIGHT AREA. I WANTED TO TALK HIGH LOW ABOUT- WORK DIVERSE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE AND THEN AGAIN- MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR WILL TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I SPENT DOES IS TO FIRST IDENTIFY MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED AREAS. SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE WORKFORCE IS MOST ACUTELY NEEDED. WE CONCENTRATE OUR WORK FORCE PROGRAMS IN THOSE AREAS. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO GROW UP AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRACTICE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEIR OWN OR ANOTHER UNDERSERVED AREA SO WE TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WITH OUR WORDS. WE ALSO TRY TO SUPPORT A RANGE OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS- THE DATA IS CLEAR THAT- NURSES NURSE PRACTITIONERS BUSINESS TRANSITION ASSISTANCE AND ALLIED WORK FORCE PROFESSIONALS TEND TO BE MORE DIVERSE THAN ANDY'S MORE LIKELY TO SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RESEARCH SHOWS BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WHOSE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS REFLECT THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE AND SO WE DO WHAT WE CAN WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS. OF THE LAW TO SUPPORT APPLICANTS WERE PROGRAMS THAT REFLECT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY. WELL WE CANNOT TAKE RACE OR GENDER INTO ACCOUNT EXPLICITLY IN MAKING AWARDS WE CAN AND DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND LANGUAGES SPOKEN. AND WE DO INCLUDE A SERVICE COMMITMENT TO SERVE IN ONE OF OUR IDENTIFIED UNDERSERVED AREAS. SO WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR OUR WORK FORCE TO LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA AND STAND READY TO EXPAND OUR TOOLS TO ACHIEVE THIS IMPORTANT CALL- SO REALLY WERE VERY MUCH INTO LISTENING MODE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT OUR WORK FORCE PROGRAMS. AND CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW WE CAN MODERNIZE OUR PROGRAMS. TO BETTER SERVE THE CALIFORNIA TODAY SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THE FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE AND THE PARTNERSHIP- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR WE CAN PROCEED WITH PRESENTING THE JERRY AFTER GERIATRIC.

WE HAVE THE MINI GRANTS PROGRAM WHICH IS A PIPELINE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENERGIZE YOUTH AND STUDENTS TO HEALTHCARE CAREERS. INCLUDING GERIATRIC HEALTHCARE. THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUEST MULTI YEAR EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME TO ADMINISTER THE FUNDING. IN WAS THERE ANY QUESTIONS I MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS. QUESTION ONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THE SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN BOTH GENERAL FUND AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND IN THE PROPOSED. BUDGET IN THE GENERAL FUND THE NEXT HUNDRED FIVE MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASE BETWEEN CURRENT YEAR BUDGET YEAR REFLECTS A DECREASE OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION CARRYOVERS. FIFTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATA PROGRAM ND FIFTY THREE MILLION FOR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. WHITE ANSETT BY ONE TIME THREE MILLION HEALTH. INCREASED TO SUPPORT THE GERIATRIC CARE WORKFORCE. IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS CONNECT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASE BETWEEN CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR REFLECTS A DROP. OFF OF THE FOLLOWING TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT ISSUES A PARTIAL SHIFT OF FUNDING TO THE WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PLAN FROM GENERAL FUND TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON TWENTY MILLION- CREATION OF THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I AM FORTY ONE FORTY ONE ZERO ONE ZERO EIGHT FIVE. TO CONTINUE THE SUPPORT OF THE LACK TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN WHITE PLAINS. SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION. QUESTION TWO PLEASE DESCRIBE OUR SPENDS PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. EVERY EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THIS SONG BROWN PROGRAM HAS SEVERAL KEY STATUTORY OBJECTIVES INCLUDING INCREASING RESIDENTS IN TRAINING PROGRAM GRADUATES FROM GROUPS TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN PRIMARY CARE. TRAINING RESIDENTS IN THEIR SERVICE AREAS IN PLACING GRADUATES IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SONG BROWN FUNDING HAS HELPED SUPPORT EIGHTEEN YEAR PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. IT IS SUPPORTING THE EXPANSION OF TWENTY THREE PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO NEW PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY SLOTS. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SONG BROWN FUNDING SUPPORTED THE OPENING OF THREE NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED- LEVIN RESIDENCY PROGRAM. STRONG BROWN SPENDING IS ALSO INCREASED POSITION TO PERSON. PROXIMALLY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS HAVE RESIDENTS THAT IN EITHER BLACK OR LATINO- 211% OF THE OVERALL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE. I SPREAD CURRENTLY HAS THIRTEEN LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS THAT ACTIVELY FOCUSED ON AWARDING APPLICANTS WERE EXPERIENCE LIVING OR WORKING WITH DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND AGREED TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. OUR SPEND ALSO HAS OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT SEEK TO CREATE A DIVERSE CULTURE CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORKFORCE. ACTRESSES UNDERSERVED AREA SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OR RENT PROGRAM. I SPENT COLLECTING REPORTS DATA ON DEMOGRAPHICS FROM THE GRANT PROGRAM. STAFF COMPARED THE RACE AND ETHNICITY OF WHAT AWARDEES AND THEIR LANGUAGES SPOKEN TO THE CAP GENERAL CALIFORNIA POPULATION. WENT AWARDEES WERE REFLECTIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION AND THE PROGRAM WAS AFFECTING EFFECTIVE IN WARDING INDIVIDUALS FROM GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ONE MEASURE OF SUCCESS FOR THESE PROGRAMS IS WEATHER WARNINGS CONTINUE TO PRACTICE IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM OR UNDERSERVED AREAS. AFTER THE TERM OF SERVICE OBLIGATION IS COMPLETE. ASHRITA SPEAKING THE STATE OR THROUGH OUR RETENTION SERVICE. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL SURVEYS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF OUR LOAN REPAYMENT AND STRIPE AND PROGRAMS. WE ADMINISTER RETENTION SURVEY PAST RECIPIENTS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH LOAN REPAYMENT AND START THE AWARDS. OF THOSE WHO ARE GRADUATED AND COMPLETED THEIR ONE YEAR SERVICE COMMITMENT 91% STAKE IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER COMPLETING THEIR SERVICE. NO WARRANTY IS THAT RECEIVED BOTH A MENTAL HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION. AND TYPE IN THE WORD REACHED REPORTED THAT THE WORDS WERE MORE IMPACTFUL. IN TERMS OF GETTING EMPLOYMENT IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND STAYING IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE ALSO SURVEY PROGRAM AWARDEES FROM VARIOUS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING AUTHORITIES FROM THE STEPHEN M. THOMPSON RUNNING PAYMENT PROGRAM. OUR FINDINGS INDICATED THAT 80% OF THE WARNINGS WERE STILL SERVING IN HIGH NEED AREA ONE YEAR AFTER COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE THIS SURVEY EACH YEAR TO MEASURE RETENTION OVER TIME. QUESTION THREE WHAT ARE CALIFORNIA'S GOALS FOR INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY OSCARS WORKFORCE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON INCREASING HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE. RESPOND BROWN PROGRAM STRIVES TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE. I WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING FIVE YEAR PLAN HAS A GOAL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DIVERSE COMPETENT LICENSED AND NON LICENSED PROFESSIONALS IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PERSONS. WITH SEVERE MENTAL. OUR SPEND LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS INTEND TO INCREASE THEIR CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN QUANTITY OR PROVIDERS SERVING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WE EXPAND OUR TOOLS TO ACHIEVE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DIVERSITY. QUESTION FOR WOULD YOU MINISTRATION BE OPEN TO ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE EACH COP WITH AN ARCH. WE ARE AWARE THAT THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION STATED THAT WELCOME. IT HEALTH CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ONE FRESNO STATE ARE KEY WORKFORCE PIPELINE PROGRAMS TO RE ROUTE. HOW MANY STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED REGIONS AND BACKGROUNDS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE CAREERS. THIS WORK IS SIMILAR TO WORK WE DO WITH OUR MANY GRANTS PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH AND STUDENTS TO EXPLORE HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCES. I DIDN'T DEFERRED FINANCE IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. NUMBER. FIVE HOW ARE YOU COULD MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED NEW ADVENTURE OKAY INCLUDED IN THE GERIATRIC WORKFORCE B. C. P. ANDERSON YOUR COMMENT. SORRY YOU SEEN NO THANK YOU. I'M SURPRISED BY HOW WILL I SHOULD KNOW THE OF PROPOSED NEW AND IN THE JERRY WERE. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED WE SURVEYS THE ASK AWARDEES ABOUT THEIR INTENT TO STAY IN A- AREA. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE SERVICE AREA. WE WILL SURVEIL TO MEASURE THEIR RETENTION AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS PROVIDERS DEVOTE TO GERIATRIC CARE. MISS REMEMBER SAID MISS RESUME I MAY STOP YOU HERE IF I CAN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE OF THE WORK PROJECT GEN ADVANCING GERIATRIC CARE- BUT I'M ALSO CURIOUS ON THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION I MEAN I KNOW IT'S NOT RELEVANT RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT AN EFFORT% BEING MADE BECAUSE I'M HEARING FROM PARENTS. THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING SPECIFIC- CAREFULLY READ THEIR THEIR CHILDREN. ARE TRAINED DOCTORS WHO KNEW HOW TO WORK WITH THESE. THIS POPULATIONS ROAD LIKE TO EITHER FURTHER AGENDAS OR MAKE SURE THAT HOSPITAL KNOWS. THAT ISN'T A BIG CONCERN. I MADE- TABLE THE QUESTION UNTIL OUR DD HEARING WHICH IS- JUST IN A WEEK OR SO AND SO I'M IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER ABSOLUTELY JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO NOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- S. FRESNO STATE'S- PROGRAMS AGO BROUGHT UP IT HAD ME THINKING ABOUT A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH ONE OF MY HOSPITAL CEOS THIS MORNING IN REGARDS TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE- HUNDREDS OF NURSING STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT HAVE COMPLETED THEIR CLINICAL HOURS- BUT WITH COVAY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GO IN AND GET THEIR TESTING. SO WE CAN'T GET THEM LICENSED AND GET THEM IN THE FIELD- SO I WANTED TO BRING THAT TO THE ATTENTION- AT THIS TIME IF THERE'S ANYTHING- ANYBODY ELSE CAN DO TO PUSH ON THAT OVER ON- THE OTHER END THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. I CAN'T SEE US CONTINUING TO PAY DOUBLE FOR TRAVELLING NURSES WHEN WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE PUT IN THEIR DAVIS AND ARE READY TO TEST. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT BACK FOR A QUESTION- TO DIRECTOR LANDSBERG. YOU HAD MADE THE COMMENT THAT WE CANNOT TAKE ETHNICITY DIRECTLY INTO ACCOUNT. I WANTED TO SEE THE DIFFERENCES WERE BETWEEN THE WHAT THE WARRANTIES WHICH ARE REFLECTIVE OF. AND SONG BROWN. WHICH DOES NOT QUITE REACH EQUITABLE. DISTRIBUTION OF PROVIDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION ASEMBLY MEMBER AND I WILL START AND SEE. IT'S ALL WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING BUT AGAIN WE DO USE ALL TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL- WITH THE WET FUNDING WE IT'S A REGIONAL APPROACH AND SO WE DID ALL A LISTENING SESSION. AND HEARD FROM FOLKS IN THE REGION ABOUT WHAT THEY MOST NEED ON THEIR ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. FOR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AGAIN WE USE TOOLS SUCH AS LOOKING AT UNDERSERVED AREAS FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE- SERVING. UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES LANGUAGES SPOKEN COMMITMENT TO THE WORK I THINK- ON SOLID GROUND. AGAIN WITH WITH PHYSICIAN POSITIONS IN PARTICULAR- WE SEE LESS. DIVERSE DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY WHEN WE DO WITH OUR NURSE PRACTITIONER- AND POSITION ASSISTANT AND OTHER POSITIONS SO IN EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS WERE USING. THE TOOLS WE CAN AND SOMETIMES. WITH THAT WITH DIFFERENT OUTCOMES. I'M I FEEL ABA TO MENTION THAT WHILE KERN THERE'S A PERCENT WHICH IS THE FIGURE YOU MENTIONED THAT IS REPRESENTED BY. LATINO AND BLACKS- WITHIN OUR CURRENT WORK FORCE YOU SAID SONG BROWN IS CURRENTLY TRAINING AT 24% AND I FEEL OBLIGATED TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF LATINO AND BLACK CALIFORNIANS AND SO IT'S HARD FOR US TO GET TO EQUITY BEFORE CURRENTLY NOT TRAINING. ABOVE THE LEVEL WHERE WE ARE AS CALIFORNIANS AND- BUT JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S POLICY DECISIONS WE CAN LOOK TO WENT. SPECIFICALLY SINCE AGE COP WAS MENTIONED IN THE FRESNO STATE I FEEL AGAIN- NEEDING TO MENTION THAT IT ORIGINALLY WAS A FEDERAL H. COPS PROGRAM AND IT WASN'T. UNTIL WE REALIZED THAT THERE WERE SO MANY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AT THE WHO WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THAT THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM ITSELF AND BROUGHT IT INTERNALLY INTO THE OFFICE. SIGNET MORE STUDENTS TO IN. AND SO I MENTIONED THAT AS A WAY FOR US TO BE CREATIVE IN COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING FORWARD THINKING AND- DIRECTOR WOULD JUST APPRECIATE FOLLOW UP WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. WITH THAT WE WILL THANK THIS PANEL FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AND WILL MOVE ON TO THE PANEL THREE CD PH WHERE WE WILL HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS.

THE HUGE IS A- ANSWER. COVER NINETY SO- AGAIN WE ARE DRY. PREVENTION AND NOT PHARMACY AND I'VE- TO MINIMIZE. HOW IMPACTS- WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO SUPPRESSING CONTAIN COVER NINETEEN AND THAT. ENCOMPASSES DOING CASE AND CONTACTED US OCCASION TESTING- ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE ON THE GROUND. AT THE HELP AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEVEL. AND WE PROVIDE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO OPERATE CONTROL AND CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES OF COURSE THE HIGHEST RISK OF THOSE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WE HAVE A-% VERY ROBUST HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION PROGRAM THAT. PROVIDES A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND THEN OF COURSE IN OTHER RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS THAT ARE HIGH RISK INCLUDING CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES OTHER WORKPLACES SCHOOLS AND OTHER COMMUNITY SETTINGS SO WE PROVIDE A LOT OF. TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ARE THERE'S MULTI JURISDICTIONAL OPERATES WE GET MORE INVOLVED BUT A LOT OF THAT FRONT LINE WORK HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL AS WELL- AND THEN WE'D CHRIS DEVELOPING PROVIDE INNOVATIVE AND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS FOR CHANGING THE COURSE OF THE CALL THE NINETEENTH AND I CAN. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY DEVELOPING OUR BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK FOR RE OPENING ECONOMY AND- HAVING THAT HEALTHEQUITY METRIC HAS REALLY CHANGED. THE WAY WE RESPOND AS A STATE- ANOTHER HE ERROR AND- IS COORDINATING AND SOMETHING. THAT HEALTH CARE S AND HEALTH CARE RESOURCES AND- PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS SO. AGAIN RIGHT NOW TOP OF MIND IS DEVELOPING AND- AND IMPLEMENTING OUR EQUITABLE BECAUSE THE NINETEEN VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN. BACK SAYING CALIFORNIANS BASED ON THE AVAILABLE VACCINE SUPPLY- WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE IN THE FALL FLU VACCINATION TO REDUCE THE BURDEN ON THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN- HARDLY ANY FLU WHICH IS- WHERE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT GIVEN HOW MUCH SURGERIES ON THE HOSPITAL'S CHESIL COVE THE NINETEEN- WE HAVE BEEN. ASSURING INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS AND ALL HEALTH CARE FACILITY SETTINGS ARE FOLLOWED AND- AGAIN MITIGATING OUTBREAKS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. MARIN PROVIDING AVAILABLE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT HEALTH CARE STUFF I SEE YOU BETTER THAN THE LEADERS TO MEET YOUR DEMANDS. AS YOU KNOWN AS YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT- WOMEN'S FINALE COMES TO SPEAK AROUND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE SUPPORT WE PROVIDED AS FAR AS PREVENTING CRISIS CARE RESPONSE AND- I'M REALLY KEEPING PEOPLE- AT WORST AND CONTINGENCY WITH ALL KINDS OF. INTERVENTIONS IT'S OF COURSE REALLY CRUCIAL AS A HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY TO THE PUBLIC. AND ENGAGE IN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS- SO COMMUNICATE I GUESS. AND UP TO DATE CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND APPROPRIATE SCIENCE BASED EASY TO UNDERSTAND INFORMATION AND ACCESSIBLE FORMATS AND LANGUAGES ABOUT THE STATUS OF VIRUS TRANSMISSION. AND KEY RESPONSE AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. WE WORK VERY HARD TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THE DISPARITIES AND DISEASE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS TO DESIGN TARGETED PUBLIC HEALTH. EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS TO DIFFERENT GROUPS- WE ALSO COURSE NEED TO FOCUS JUST ON OUR OVERALL COORDINATION ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT- AND ACROSS OUR OWN INTERNAL AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE A COORDINATED RESPONSE AND- REALLY ENSURE WE HAVE AN ALL GOVERNMENT AND ALL COMMUNITY REALLY RESPONSIVE THIS PANDEMIC SO- WE HAD THEN LEADING- ACROSS WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND A LOT OF OTHER- EXCELLENT PARTNERS- WE HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH A LOT OF DIFFERENT TASK FORCES WORK GROUPS AND INITIATIVES. WE'VE BEEN FOSTER ACCORDING TO MULTI AGENCY APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF- SUBGROUPS WITHIN THE POPULATION INCLUDING IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AND DEVELOPING A UNIFIED DATA SYSTEM ANALYTICAL DASHBOARDS FOR THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CONTINUE ON THAT CROSSES MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN REALLY CRUCIAL AS WELL COURSES YOU KNOW WE HAVE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SO AS A STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE PARTNER WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE NOT AN ARM ESSENTIALLY OF OUR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH ACROSS THE STATE. DEPARTMENT ALL OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE COLLABORATE CLOSELY WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE DEVEOPMENT OF EQUITABLE POLICIES AND- PLANS WITH THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH- EACH OF LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR- SO THE SISTER ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE- CALIFORNIA COVERS LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION- AND HELP US AS A NATION OF CALIFORNIA- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE DISTRICT OFFICES FOR LICENSING INSERT THAT WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH. OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL COORDINATION TEAMS. WERE DEVELOPED- AND WE'RE RIGHT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCES TO SUPPLEMENT SUPPORT THE LOCAL RESPONSE. SO THAT'S SORT OF A OVERVIEW OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR OVER ARCHING STRATEGIES- RESPONSE. AND THEN WE WERE ASKED TO ADDRESS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REMAINING COVE IN NINETEEN CHALLENGES. THAT ARE STILL FACING THE STATE AND I THINK- THERE'S A FEW KEY AREAS WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT- OBVIOUSLY AGAIN VACCINATION AND- GETTING OUR VACCINE OUT- YOU KNOW QUICKLY YEAH I QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AND HAVING GOOD DATA COLLECTION AROUND THAT SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE. MAXINE IS- I THINK OUR OTHER BIG CHALLENGE- WELL WE ARE GETTING EVERYONE EXCITED IS MODERATING AND STAYING ON TOP OF ANY VARIANTS THAT. MERGE SO WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME OF THE YOU CAME HERE AFTER BE ONE SEVEN IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST GENOMIC SEQUENCING- NETWORKS IN THE COUNTRY- BUT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO DO MORE AND WE'RE RAPIDLY SCALING THAT UP RIGHT NOW AS WELL- IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEQUENCE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND. AYE SLIPS WHICH IS A HUGE PROPORTION OF THAT SEQUENCES- ACROSS THE COUNTRY- SO WE'VE BEEN ALSO WORKING WITH OUR MODELING TEAMS TO LOOK AT HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT THINGS ARE ALSO MONITORING. OF VARIANCE THAT YOU KNOW- WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN OTHER STATES BUT WE'RE DETECTING A LOT HERE AND UNDERSTAND. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT ACCORDING WITH THE SEC AND- THE GROUND FOR AT THE END OF THAT. A HUGE HUGE CHALLENGE IS THAT. THE T. THE- RIGHT UP IS TIRED YOU ARE HARD TIME. WE TIRED AND PEOPLE. WE NEED TO REALLY- BE PATIENT WITH US GETTING VACCINE OUT. SORT OF GET. THROUGH TELLING TO HER TO. AND WE ALL NEED TO CAN TO DO ALL THESE IMPORTANT. UNTIL WE CAN GET THERE. SO CONTAINING I'M ASKING OUR PHYSICAL DISTANCING ALL THESE REALLY IMPORTANT NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS ARE IMPORTANT UNTIL WE REALLY CAN GET- TO A HERD IMMUNITY AND GET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS AND AGAIN WE KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY TIRED OF THOSE THINGS SO. TRYING TO FIND FRESH AND NEW WAYS TO KEEP PEOPLE- KEEP PEOPLE WITH US AND ALL THESE IMPORTANT INTERVENTIONS. AND THEN OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW GETTING OUR SCHOOLS REOPEN IS A HUGE IMPORTANT CHALLENGE THAT WE NEED TO- THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AND TAT IT'S JUST- STILL FACING US AS WE NEED TO GET OUR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL. AND YOU KNOW IF FOR MOST AND CENTER WE'VE BEEN TALKING THROUGHOUT AS ONE OF OUR CORE VALUES MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING EQUITY AND ALL THESE ISSUES IS KIND OF EXTREMELY HAS MAGNIFIED- THE DISPARITIES IN OUR- SOCIETY AND IN OUR STATE AND I THINK WE HAVE DONE- WITHIN A REAL LEADER AND THAT'S NATIONALLY- BUT WE- CONTINUE TO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO ADDRESS ALL THE INEQUITIES THAT- THAT WE'RE. SEEING THIS CATHOLIC. THERE WERE A COUPLE OTHER. THAT WERE. TO LATER ON. AND THEY WERE TO JUST MENTION AS WELL. I NUMBER. WAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OUTSTANDING UNMET NEEDS. AT THE STATE LEVEL THEY'RE SLOWING OUR PROGRESS AND I THINK THE ONES THAT I JUST OUTLINED ARE ARE EXACTLY THAT SO AGAIN GETTING ALL OVER. THANK SEEN- AND GETTING MORE SUPPLY AND GETTING THAT INTO PEOPLE. AND AGAIN MONNING THE VARIANT. COOL I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY ARE OUR FUTURE AND OUTSTANDING. AND THEN AS FAR AS HOW WILL THE STATE INSURE EQUITY IN THE NEW VACCINE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM- UTILIZING A NEW THIRD PARTY STRAIGHTER SO WE'VE BEEN. WORKING CLOSELY WITH- ON THE PLANS FOR THAT AND WE- ARE WORKING ON NOT ONLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS- WHEN THE T. PAY STARTS WILL BE- LOOKING AT OUR HELP THE PLACE INDEX WHICH WE ALSO USE FOR HEALTH EQUITY METRIC IN THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY PROVIDING ALLOCATION VACCINES IN THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST IMPACT SO THAT IS ONE KEY THING AS FAR AS ALLOCATION AND THEN OTHER PRINCIPLES WERE WORKING CLOSELY ON- INCORPORATING INTO HAVE I SEEN IS DISTRIBUTED WOULDN'T INCLUDE. HEY FOR PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS SO WE WILL- BE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE INCENTIVES FOR VACCINATING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING IN THE LOWEST EACH BACKWARD TILES. AND ALSO- THANK AGING AND NOT ONLY A PROVIDERS THAT CAN- BRING VACCINES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT ALSO WITH THE CAMPUS ORGANIZATIONS ARE TO HELP THAT OUR REGION ENGAGEMENT. REALLY ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY- SO AND PAY FOR TERM OUR REGION AND IS AN EFFORT AND CANCER PAYMENT FOR. AND JUST RESOURCE NEEDED AS ACCESSIBILITY INTERPRET INTERPRETERS- PROVIDING MOBILE SITES GETTING INTO NONTRADITIONAL SITES AS WELL AS- AFTER HOURS MAKING SURE IT'S AVAILABLE AT ALL DIFFERENT TIMES- AND OTHER CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE THAT SO THOSE ARE THE DIFFERENT WAYS WE ARE. WORKING TO ENSURE THERE IS EQUITY AND THE NEW VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. AND THEN I WAS ALSO- I SHALL WAIT TO- TURN OVER TO SEASON FINALE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THEN I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW AFTER THAT WASN'T SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT- DOCTOR REGULAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS HAVE PRESSED ABOUT SOME OF THE DATA. THANK YOU DR GRAHAM MISPRONOUNCED. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME. HELLO YES OKAY SO I WAS ASKED TO- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- WHAT HAS WORKED WELL AND NOT ROLE IN TERMS OF OUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE- I THINK I'LL START WITH THEM BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND- HAVE CONTINUED THE DIALOGUE ON POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY OF THESE- DIFFERENT POLICIES I THINK WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND ADAPT THOSE POLICIES. AS WE WORK WITH OUR SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS BUT AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SIXTY ONE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND SOMETIMES WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND HAS BEEN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO I THINK THAT IS SOMETIMES A IFFICULT AS WE TRY TO CREATE STATE POLICIES. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT- DOES SIXTY ONE DIFFERENT- PICTURES ON THE GROUND AND SO WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO. ALLOW FLEXIBILITY WHEN WE CAN AND TO HAVE STATEWIDE POLICY WHEN WE NEED TO AND I'LL GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT I THINK THE WORST EXCESSES SO I THINK WHEN WE MOVED TO- TORN AWAY FROM THE VARIANTS AND SOME OF THE EARLY STAGES INTO THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. I THINK THAT WENT A LONG WAY AND PUTTING EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE AS TO WHAT TO EXPECT WHAT WOULD OPEN AND WHEN AND WONDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND I THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY LEADS TO A MUCH BETTER PROCESS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PREDICT AND- BOTH AT THE PUBLIC SECTOR- YEAH THE PUBLIC AND BUSINESS SECTOR AS WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ABILITY. TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING I THINK OUR EQUITY PLAYBOOK IN OUR EQUITY METRIC IS A TRUE SIGN OF SIX UP BETWEEN YOU KNOW WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH STAND FOR AND HOW WE WANT TO RUN THE RESPONSE TO- PROTESTS VIRUS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ADEQUATELY AND THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THAT REAL- ACROSS THE STATE I THINK WHAT WE MOVED AS WE OPEN SECTORS AND REALIZED THAT OUR COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION WOUND UP MOVING TO THE REGIONAL STAY AT. HOME ORDER I'M LAWS FOR REALLY. AND US. MAKE SURE THAT. PREVENTIVE DENTICLE HEALTH CARE CAPACITY FROM BEING OVER ONE- AND THE OBJECTIVE TO SET LIMITS IN A- WITH. WITH OTHER FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSEHOLD AND NOT SOLD TO REDUCE. COVE IN NINETEEN TRANSIT. BY REDUCING THE STERN TRANSMISSION WE'RE ABLE TO I'M REALLY REDUCE THAT. BEND THE CURVE DOWNWARD SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE HAVE OUR MODELERS LOOKING OUT THAT AND MAKING SURE PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT IMPACT THAT HAD AND COMPARED TO PROJECTIONS FROM. PRIOR TO THE REGIONAL STAND HOME ORDER WE THINK BY LATE JANUARY THERE WERE AT LEAST. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FEWER HOSPITALIZATIONS- FIVE THOUSAND FEWER DEATHS BECAUSE OF THE REGIONAL STAY AT HOME ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL STAND HOME ORDER TEMPORARILY BARRED PRIVATE GATHERINGS CLOSE RESTAURANT OPERATIONS. KLEPPER CARRY OUT DELIVERY AND REDUCED RETAIL CAPACITY IN REGIONS WITH LESS THAN. 15% I SEE YOU PAPER AVAILABILITY. WE GAVE NEW GUY. OUT THE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT REGION STAND HOME ORDER WE THEN ALL MOVE TO A PUBLIC ORDER. THAT CANCELLED ELECTIVE SURGERIES WHEN A WITH THAT. CAPACITY FOR- ALL FOR A LOT SEE YOU PASS IT. AND THAT HELP TO REALLY- MAY SURE THAT WE HAD AN APPLE ACT DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTHCARE RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE AND STATE OUT OF CRISIS CARE OR MOVE VERY QUICKLY OUT OF CRISIS CARE. THROUGHOUT ALL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. I THINK WE CONTINUE TO USE OUR MODELS AND PROJECTIONS TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION AND TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS I THINK YOU KNOW IT THEY IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING OF WE ARE ALL ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY ABOUT THE VIRUS AND WHAT. WE CAN DO TO COMBAT THAT BUT I THINK REALLY THAT SUCCESS HAS BEEN THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND THE ABILITY TO CHANGE COURSE WELL AS WE LEARN MORE. ABOUT THE VIRUS. OBVIOUSLY SOME COUNTIES BETTER WORSE THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TOOLS EXPERTISE AND EVEN COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION- AND I THINK WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST. EVEN EVEN IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE- AND MANY ALLERGIES HAVE BROADER OR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE. SEEN SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN STAFF. THEIR DATA SYSTEMS THAT HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH TECHNOLOGY. OUR RESOURCES ARE NOT. EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE JUMPED IN A BIGGER WAY IN PLACES LIKE IMPERIAL COUNTY THE CENTRAL VALLEY SOME OF THE RURAL COUNTIES- SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE SEEN THE HIGHEST TRANSMISSION- TO REALLY TRY EQUAL. OUT THAT- THOSE RESOURCES AND REALLY HAVE RELIED ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESPONSE STRUCTURE. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO AFTER THE NEEDED RESOURCES AND TO DO OUR BEST TO GET THEM. SO IN IMPERIAL COUNTY WE STARTED BEAR GIVEN THE HIGH TRANSMISSION LARGELY IMPACTED BY THE BORDER. AND REALLY HELPING WITH THE HEALTH CARE SIR JOHN OF TWO HOSPITALS BUT ALSO HELPING THE CONTACT TRACING. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAD ACCESS TO TESTING AND REALLY AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO GET THEM THE RESOURCES THAT NEED THEY NEED IT. AND WE DID SEEN HERE OF FOUR TO SIX WEEKS LATER A REAL REDUCTIONIN THEIR TRANSMISSION AND LYFT IMPACT ON OUR HOSPITALS. WE THEN USE THAT AS AMODEL FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE- CREATING UNIFIED SUPPORT TEAM SEND ONE OUT TO YOU. EACH OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES CAN WORK WITH THEM I AM THE SAME WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED MEDIA PER HEALTHCARE SURGE. THAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY NEED OR FOR TESTING AND FOR CONTACT TRACING. WE'VE SET UP A SERIES OF LOCAL COORDINATORS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND HELPING BASE WITH EVERY COUNTY EITHER SIGNED A DIFFERENT COUNTIES. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTY EVERY WEEK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST. TO GET THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. HEALTH CARE THIRD WE HAVE THOUSAND STATE. AND STAFF. CLINICAL PEOPLE OUT. IN THESE HAVE. ARE THE TO ME SURE. THE RESOURCE THAT ARE NEEDED- SUPPLEMENT HEALTH CARE TO. SO ARE IN PLACE- AND WE HAVE- WHO REALLY SPENT TIME AND OF THE CONTACT RACING WE BUILD TECH HOW CAN ACCESS THEM WITH A LOT OF INPUT FROM OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHEREBY NOW. WE HAVE FIFTY FOUR OUT OF SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS REALLY USING THAT CAL CAN ACCESS THEM FURTHER CONTACT RATING AND CON AND DISEASE INVESTIGATION- AND THEN WE DID OUR BEST TO CREATE TESTING- ACCESS TO TESTING ACROSS THE STATE THROUGH- VOLUNTEER LAB THROUGH THE OPTIM SURFSIDE'S THROUGH MANY WAYS. OF GETTING ACCESS IN. THOSE HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. I'M AND SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE TO TRY TO DO OUR ABOUT TO EAT OUT THE- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO AND RECOGNIZING THAT. YOU KNOW NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME ORG RESOURCES WHETHER THAT BE CONTACT TRACING. TAPPING SOME OF THE- PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENT THAT DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN TESTING LABS- LAWYER GIVEN GREATER ACCESS TO THE ON SALE- SO I MOVE ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER- IN TERMS OF WHAT IS ART. CDPH AS ROLAND BAXEEN DISTRICT DISTRIBUTION. AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN- TRANSITION AS WE MOVE TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO RUN THE COMMITTEES AND SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY A VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT SCIENTIFIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND THAT DRAFTING GUIDELINES COMMITTEE WHERE WE GET INPUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE ARE SOLID. WE SAT POLICY WORKING WITH THESE STAKEHOLDERS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE COMMITTEES. WE SERVE AS A- TO CDC DIRECTLY AND WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE. TECHNICAL EXPERTISE- J. OR Q. COMBAT THE FIRE AS WELL- MAN GET PEOPLE VACCINATED. WE IN ROLE PROVIDERS FOR THE VACCINE TO- AND MINISTRATION. WE ALLOCATE DOSES OF VACCINE BASED ON THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS PROPORTIONATE TO THE PUBLIC PREVALENCE OF EACH POPULATION THAT IS PRIORITIZED IN NOT COUNTY. WE HELP WITH THE STATEWIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AND EDUCATION. AND WE MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP THE DATA SYSTEMS IN COLLABORATION WITH. OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS- THAT INCLUDES THE CARE AND REGIONAL REGISTRY. HI MY CAL BACKS- THE MY TURN SYSTEM WHICH IS ON BOTH THE PUBLIC SCHEDULING AND CLINIC MANAGEMENT. WE INTERACT WITH THE FEDERAL DATA SYSTEMS SUCH AS VACCINES- FINDER AND WE TRACKED BAXEEN ADMINISTRATION. AND WE WILL BE ASSISTING IN THE TRANSITION. TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. THE LAST PIECE I WANTED TO COMMENT ABOUT WHAT THE FUNDING. AND THERE ARE REALLY TWO BLOCK OF FUN THE MIDDLE CLASS WAS AND WHY REALLY UP THAT HUNDRED FIFTY SOUTH MILLION. THAT IS SPECIFIC BACKS DISTRIBUTION THAT MONEY- WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF THE- DETERMINING HOW MUCH WILL BE GRANTED TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. ON THE THIS IS DEDICATED SOLELY TO VACCINE ADMINISTRATION- AND THERE ARE. THIS IS DUE TO THE FED'S ON MARCH FIRST WE'RE STILL WORKING TO IRON OUT EXACTLY HOW WE'LL USE THOSE DOLLARS IN COMPARISON TO THE ONE POINT. SEVEN BILLION THAT WE GOT- IN THE ENHANCED DETECTION HE'LL SEE GRANT- WE'RE WE ARE GIVING ONE POINT TWO BILLION OUT TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. AND LOS ANGELES IS FUNDED DIRECTLY AT FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION IN ADDITION TO R. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION- THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR LOCALS AS I SAID IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION. DIVIDED UP TO THE REMAINING OUTSIDE OF TOP OF LOS ANGELES GIVING EACH COUNTY OR EACH LOCAL HEALTH CARE SECTION I WILL ONE MILLION DOLLAR BASED. WHAT THE REMAINING FUNDS DIVIDED 50% ON POPULATION BASE SHARE 25% ADOPTED FOR POVERTY AND 25% ADJUSTED. FOR AGE RACE AND ETHNICITY. TRYING TO ALLOW THEM. TAXABLE IN THE USE OF THIS. ACROSS STRATEGIES WE HAVE- THAT FINANCE HOUSES A LETTER TO THE DAILY BEAST BREAK DOWN THE COUNTY ALLOCATION ON THIS APPLICATION IS DUE TO THE FEDS ON MARCH EIGHTEENTH. AND BECAUSE OF THIS HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION A LARGE- YEAH THE IT IS COMPREHENSIVE AND NOT IT STILL INCLUDES CONTACT TRACING LABORATORY. CAPACITY AND TESTING AND INCLUDES- VACCINE ADMINISTRATION DATA ANALYTICS AND STOPPING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT ALSO CAN BE USED FOR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. MMHM MANY OF THE- MAXINE SUPPORT CAN BE DONE AN EITHER PRODUCTS FUNDING HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW DISTINCT THINGS THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE OUT OF A VACCINE SPECIFIC FUNDING OR THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION. SO WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT WILL BE WORKING WITH JACK AND CCHL TIRE NOW BUT- WHAT THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION WILL BE USED. TO SUPPORT. WITHOUT FIVE I WOULD IT BACK OVER TO A WHO WILL- ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ON RACE AND ETHNICITY. THANK YOU SUSAN- YOU KNOW HEARING AGAIN. YES MA'AM OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- SO- AGAIN WE DID RECEIVE YOUR LETTER DR AMBULANCE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS- AND I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF WALK THROUGH I'M SORRY THAT SOMETHING TECHNOLOGY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SHARE SCREEN TO SHOW YOU BUT I'LL JUST TRY TO READ YOU SOME NUMBERS- AND WE CAN OF COURSE FOLLOW UP AFTER- AND SEND THESE OVER TO YOU- AS FAR AS HOW MANY VACCINES WE RECEIVED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AN ADMINISTERED WE HAVE NOW RECEIVED. OVER SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOSES DELIVERED TO US FROM THE CDC IT'S US SEVEN POINT ONE ONE NINE TWO TWO FIVE TOTAL DOSES AMONGST THOSE WE HAVE NOW- ADMINISTERED FOUR POINT SEVEN OF OVER FOUR POINT SEVEN DOSES ADMINISTERED SO ONE MILLION SEVEN FORTY SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE- SO THAT IS BASICALLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT IT. DOESN'T DELIVER HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED. AT ALSO REALLY HAPPY TO SHARE THAT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED SO EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS. HAVE RECEIVED TWO DOSES THAT MEANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED- SO AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO ADD WE HAVE REALLY. YOU KNOW MORE THAN DOUBLE THE CAPACITY FROM ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO AND SO WE ARE NOW SEEING OU KNOW AND DALY. TAXATION RATES OF- I BELIEVE IT'S A HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND A DAY. AND REALLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASING CAPACITY AND NOW YOU KNOW THE REAL ESTATE CONTINUES TO BE- GETTING THE VACCINE AND GETTING MORE SUPPLY. AS FAR AS ACCOUNTING FOR THE RESET AND- OF EACH PERSON- SO THEIR RACE ETHNICITY DATA IS COLLECTED WITH THE VACCINATION RECORD- AND TO KIND OF READ THROUGH SO FOR AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN. NATIVE OF THAT PERCENT IS ZERO POINT TWO EIGHT PERCENT- TEN THOUSAND SEVEN FORTY TO THAT OF AN ACCIDENT WITH A AT LEAST ONE DOSE. SO THAT IS- ZERO POINT 3% OF BAD PEOPLE GOTTEN AT LEAST ONE DOSE. THAT ASIAN RACE IN THE STATE WOULD HAVE THIRTEEN POINT 6% OF THE TOTAL DOSES ADMINISTERED- I THINK I'M JUST GONNA TALK TO THE PERCENTAGES THAT SEEMS- MOST EASY TO RELATE TO. BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN IT'S BEEN TWO POINT 7% OF THE TOTAL DOSES ADMINISTERED. A LATINO FIFTEEN POINT ONE PERCENT. MULTIRACIAL FOURTEEN POINT 6% ACTUALLY VERY LARGE CATEGORY- THAT I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE'RE STARTING TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO TEASE THAT OUT BUT IT IS AGAIN A LARGE CATEGORY. A NATIVE ONE OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDERS ZERO POINT 5% AND THEN OTHER TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT- SO AGAIN TRYING TO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY- AND THEN OR. MISSING DATA FOR TEN POINT 3% UNKNOWN AT AND THEN OF WAITED THIRTY. CLEANING THIS DATA- AND- WELL IT WILL BE REPORTING THIS- ON OUR DASHBOARD SOMETHING AT LEAST AS WELL. AS FAR AS AGE BREAKDOWN- SO WE DO COLLECTED OF BIRTH PERFECT MISSION RECORD- IN THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. SO YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW- AS YOU LIKELY KNOW THAT AND HAS NOT THESE VACCINES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED YET OR- INDIVIDUALS UNDER SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE SO WE DO HAVE. A POINT SEVEN YEAR OLD THAT HAVE- THE NEXT NEEDED AND IN EIGHTEEN TO FORTY NINE YEAR EIGHT- GROUP. THIRTY FIVE POINT 6% OF THE TOTAL DOSES ADMINISTERED HAVE BEEN IN EIGHTEEN TO FORTY NINE YEAR OLDS. IN THE FIFTY TO SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD- AGE GROUP WE'VE HAD NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND THEN- ALMOST FORTY FIVE PERCENT- HAVE BEEN IN SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AND AGAIN TO REMIND YOU THIS DATA- IS PRIMARILY FROM OUR PHASE ONE EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS FOCUSING ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND- INDIVIDUALS IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND% THEN. IN THE LAST- ABOUT THREE WEEKS OR SO- THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN- VACCINATIONS FOR PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. AND THEN IN SOME AREAS WAS STARTING TO VACCINATE OR- IN THE OTHER THREE SECTORS THAT WERE IN TIER ONE OF THESE WENDY. WHICH ARE EMERGENCY SERVICES- AGRICULTURE AND. FOOD AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. AS FAR AS AND CRY ABOUT HEALTH STATUS THE IMAGE REGS IT'S- CAN. ARE PART OF THE MAX RECORD AND THAT IS WHERE WE'RE RELYING ON THE SERVER MUSICIAN DATA- YOU KNOW AND SEEING SOME OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT RESPONSES TO THIS QUESTION. SOME OF THEM ARE COLLECTING IT BUT IF. OF AND OF COURSE IF- IF WE'RE RECEIVING SOME DATA FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS WITH THAT DATA IS NOT TRANSFERRED. TO THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY- IS EVERY ASIAN BROKEN DOWN BY ZIP CODE YES. THE KIND OF RESIDENTS IS COLLECTED WITH TAX NATION RECORDS- AND THAT REALLY HELPS US LOOK AT THE HELP THE PRICE INDEX DATA. SO WE HAVE SEEN- THAT- AMONGST PERSONS PERSONS WITH- AT LEAST ONE DOSE AS- 31% THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN WITH MORE THAN ONE DOES- AND ONLY POINT 006% HAVE BEEN RECEIVED TWO DOSES AND THEN IN THE- SECOND MOST DISADVANTAGED GROUP WE HAVE A AT LEAST ONE DOSE AND THEN POINT OUT OR THOSE EXTENDED WITH MORE THAN TWO DOSES- AND THEN FOR THE S. SECOND AB TO HIGHEST LEASES SPENT DISADVANTAGE. ZERO POINT TWO OF THOSE- THAT REVISING RUNNING WINDOWS AND THEN POINT OH FOUR AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS IS AND THEN FOR THE LEAST DISADVANTAGED- WHAT THE MOST ADVANTAGE ZERO POINT TWO NINE- SO AGAIN WE CAN GET THESE NUMBERS TO YOU- ON A HARD COPY. LATER THAN THE EXPLAINS WHAT TO SEE- SORT. OF THE NUMBERS AND SOME GRAPHICS RELATED TO. I THINK THAT YEAH THE QUESTION YOU DOCTOR BROWN WE WILL NOW MOVE TO MISS MORALIS. IF MR MORALIS IS UNAVAILABLE SHE MAY BE ON UTAH OR SHE MAY HAVE- TECHNICAL ISSUES WE CAN MOVE ON TO. A MISTER BUT ALSO. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ARE A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO I'M SUPPORT PICTURES DISEASE MODELING AND THEN HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS. I'M SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE A REQUEST FOR A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A STARTING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND INCUMBENTS ARE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO SUPPORT INSPECTIONS DISEASE MODELING ACTIVITIES AS PART OF THE URGENT COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC RESPONSE BY INCREASING INTERNAL CAPACITY TO CONDUCT OVERSEE AND UTILIZE HIGH QUALITY DATA MODELING TO INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECISIONS. TO HELP PARTICIPATE IN A CUPBOARD NINETEEN MODELING AND ANALYTICS CONSORTIUM. AS EVERYONE'S WELL AWARE AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE AT THE DEPARTMENT QUICKLY ESTABLISH CORONAVIRUS BY MODELING TEAM. AND THIS MODELING IS PLAYED A VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN INFORMING NUMEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS AND POLICIES. I'M SINCE THEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. DEVELOPING LAUNCHED H. CALIFORNIA COVER NINETEEN MODELING AND ANALYTICS CONSORTIUM IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY- WITH INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND THIS CONSORTIUM WAS DEVELOPED TO REALLY. CONSOLIDATE MODELING AND ANALYTIC ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE USED TO INFORM STATE POLICY DECISIONS AND TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE REACH OF THE UC SYSTEM. WHICH SPANS ACROSS NINE WC ACADEMIC AND HEALTH CAMPUSES AND BRINGS TOGETHER OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INVESTIGATORS. WITH VERY DIVERSE ACADEMIC AND TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE. THIS PROPOSAL REALLY INTENDS TO LEVERAGE THE COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF THIS CONSORTIUM AND MEET THE URGENT NEEDS OF THE KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE THIS PROPOSAL ALSO SEEKS TO ADDED. A VERY MUCH NEEDED CAPACITY. ORDER PART AND HIRING DEDICATED STAFF MEMBER. EXISTING STAFFING. MAINTAINED THE- TO SERVICE THE CONSORTIUM LEAD. ACTUALLY SURE WERE EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGING OUR THIS COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARKERS. AND SO THAT'S REALLY JUST STARTED THIS PROPOSAL IN SUMMARY IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE. MISTER BONNER. WE WILL. NOW MOVES ON TO MISTER VIDAL. THANK YOU MY NAME IS WHAT THE CITY PIZZA BROKER QUALITY- WE OPPOSE ANY PC P. REQUESTED ONE POSITION AND- HUNTING FOR ONE UNDERSCORES DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ARE GOING THROUGH AFTER. THE FIRST EMISSION REGULATIONS FOR A PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT STOCKPILE TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF P. P. FOR ALL HEALTH CARE TO SITUATE CHRISTMAS DAY IT IS MANDATED BY SB TWO SEVENTY FIVE. CDPH WILL NEED TO WORK WITH THE CURRENT OF THE- RELATIONS TO DETERMINE. THE TYPE AND AMOUNT OF P. G. BEING MAINTAINED BY THE PROVIDER BASED ON THE TYPE AND SIZE OF EACH PROVIDER. AS WELL AS THE COMPOSITION OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN THIS WORKFORCE- IT IS REALLY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE HASN'T. THANK YOU SIR WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DOCTOR WALKS IS ME TO SERRA BOSS. ONE IF MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU I'M HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS SERRA BOSTON I'M THE MADERA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR. ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF JACKSON COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL CULTURE STATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON COPING NINETEEN RESPONSE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS THE EROSION OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO BE MADE. IN PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING OF RESET AND RESOURCES SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE TRUST FOR AMERICA'S HEALTH RECENT ANALYSIS REPORTED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. HAS BEEN UNDER FUNDED BY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE. LOCALLY THE UNDERFUNDING OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEANT LIMITED CONTACT TRACING AND DISEASE INVESTIGATION WORKFORCE. LIMITED EPIDEMIOLOGISTS. OUTDATED DATA SYSTEMS AND REDUCED PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY CAPACITY AND LACK OF UPDATE EQUIPMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE SERVING A MUCH LARGER POPULATION TODAY LESS LESS FUNDING AND STUFF AND WE HAD PRIOR TO THE RECESSION WHILE ALSO FACING GREATER HEALTH INEQUITIES AND CRITICAL ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND CLIMATE CHANGE CONTRIBUTING TO MORE EXTREME WILDFIRES. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AGAIN DUE TO LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE ESTATE OF RAMPING UP CRITICAL ASPECTS OF KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE. CONTACT TRACING INTO SEASON BEST OCCASION TESTING EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO EVERY SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY AROUND STATE GUIDANCE FOR PENSION PLANS AN OUTBREAK MEDICATION. AND NOW VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LACK ENOUGH CONTACT TRACERS AND DISEASE INVESTIGATORS HOWEVER. ARE ABLE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONTACT TRACERS AND IF HE'S DISEASE INVESTIGATORS WITH CARES ACT FUNDING AND OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS THAT CAME TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS THE STATE ALSO SUPPORTED CONTACT TRACERS DISEASE INVESTIGATORS BY DEPLOYING STATE STAFF INTO THESE JURISDICTIONS. WELL THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING CAPACITY IS TEMPORARY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM RETAINING STAFF TO WORK ON OTHER CRITICAL DISEASES LATER ON SUCH AS STDS. AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. PROTESTING SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE ABLE TO STAND UP TESTING SITES USING FEDERAL CARES FUNDS WHILE OTHERS WERE SUPPLMENTED. COUNTY WE HOUSE BOTH STATE AND LOCALLY FUNDED TESTING GIVING US FLEXIBILITY WHETHER TESTING SITE TO DEPLOY TO HIGH RISK LOW ACCESS COMMUNITIES. AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO EXPAND TESTING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN ACCESS ADDITIONAL TESTING MODALITIES IN PHASES. INCLUDES ACCESS TO TESTING KITS THAT ARE SHIPPED TO VALENCIA BRANCH LAB AND NEW MOBILE TESTING TEAMS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW COSTS ARE STILL BEING INCURRED BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE EXISTING LOCALLY FUNDED TEST SITES TO SHIP TESTING KIT STUFF ONCE YOUR BRANCH LAB. AND OR THE COST OF LOCATION AND SECURITY FOR THE STATE RUN SITES. LOCAL ALSO WERE WITH CARE PROVIDERS HOSPITALS LONG TERM HEALTH. FACILITIES AND I'M SORRY THROUGH OUR MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL COORDINATOR OR THE BALLPARK. TO COORDINATE RE RECALL FOR FROM. TO VENTILATORS TO HEALTH CARE STAFFING AS WELL AS HELP WITH PATIENT MOVEMENT DURING SEARCH TIME. OKAY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MANAGE LOCAL UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARDS TO STATE SECTOR pEDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO EVERY SECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY WITH LOCAL MEDIA. TO QUITE CORRECTLY APPLY STATE PLANS AND EIGHT AND ALBERT MEDICAID. THESE HAVE BEEN FURTHER PIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH CARE ACT AND LOCAL. FOR AND LASTLY ON FEB ADMIN I'D LIKE TO DOWN THE PART ON VACCINE. AND HOW THIS ARGUED SPEC. FIRST THE STATE ALLOCATES A PORTION CAL. ALLOCATION TO THE FOR. OF PHARMACY. I WOULD CVS AND- ARE SO TO FAX. ONE TERM CARE FOR. AND PARTICIPATING JURISDICTIONS. A STATE THEN ALLOCATES ABOUT PER OF THE REMAINING ALLOCATION TO WHAT THEY CALL AND SEE EASE OUR MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDED STATE CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT ARE LARGE LIKE DIGNITY KAISER AND SUTTER. THE STATE PROVIDES THE ALLOCATION TO THE M. C. DECIDE HOW VACCINE WILL BE ADDED TO THEIR ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE STATE ALLOCATES THE OTHER 80% TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS THIS INCLUDES A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THREE STUDY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DECIDES HOW MUCH RETAIN OR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT CLINICS OR HI IT'S WHAT WE CALL THEM POINTS OF DISPENSING. AND HOW TO ALLOCATE TO PROVIDERS ACROSS THE JURISDICTION. WHILE BALANCING THE SCARCITY ISSUE. AS PART OF THE EFFORT TO RAMP UP OPERATIONS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS AIMED AT REACHING Q. COMMUNITIES. IN THE STATE ASKED LHD USED TO INCREASE AREN'T SEXY VACCINATION QUICKLY THE RESPONSE WAS SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE. AND THEN THREE WEEKS FOR EXAMPLE MADERA COUNTY INCREASED VACCINATION PASTI FROM A FEW HUNDRED PER WEEK TO TWO THOUSAND VACCINATIONS WEEKLY. WE HAVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN THIS PACE DUE TO VACCINATION SHORTAGE WE DO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY. TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF VACCINATION. WITH ADDITIONAL VACCINE MADERA COULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE CAPACITY WHILE STILL PRIORITIZING HONORABLE GROUPS. EQUITY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HOWEVER CURRENT DATA ON VACCINE ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT YET REFLECT AN EQUITABLE ADMINISTRATION. IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE FOLLOWING THE STATE'S VACCINATION PRIORITIZATION. WHICH FIRST PRIORITIZE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION WILL LIKELY THEN ALIGN THIS POINT MORE AROUND HEALTH CARE WORKER DEMOGRAPHICS. HOWEVER S. LHD IS MOVE INTO A PHASE ONE B. WE ARE DEPLOYING VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO TARGET VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ARE LEANING ON PARTNERSHIPS TO FURTHER SUPPORT EQUITY. BUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR AND NOW THE REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO USE MY TURN. LHD IS ENCOURAGE THE STATES TO PROVIDE NEEDED DOSES TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SAID THAT THE VACCINE SITES CAN RAMP UP TO FULL CAPACITY. CONSULT WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ON VACCINE ALLOCATION THROUGHOUT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. TRANSITION CURRENT PROVIDERS INTO THE TGA PROVIDER NETWORK WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT INPUT SO THAT PROVIDERS THAT CAN REACH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BUT THAT MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED EFFICIENT BASED ON VOLUME OUR PACE COULD CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE TRUSTED. UNLESS THEY PROVIDE THE FUNCTIONALITY NEEDED FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. AND AN ADDRESSING THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED. I'VE BEEN ASKED I'M TO PLEASE DESCRIBE WHAT IS WORKS WELL AND WHAT HAS NOT WORKED WELL IN TERMS OF THE SHARED PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN COUNTIES AND THE STATE. BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE NAVIGATING THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINE IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAS NOT BEEN EASY. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS MADE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HAD MAINTAINS REGULAR COMMUNICATION THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. THE STATE HAS ALSO TAKEN SOME PROACTIVE STEPS TO WORK WITH COUNTIES IN ADDRESSING INEQUITIES SUCH AS CREATING UNIFIED SUPPORT TEAMS ARE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES I SEASON FINALE DESCRIBES. WE RECOGNIZE THE PASTE AND MUCH WE'RE ALL WORKING TO SAVE LIVES AND THE TREND AMOUNT OF WORK THE STATE IS DOING. HOWEVER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST BE PARTNERS IN SHAPING THE POLICIES AND STRATEGIES BEING ANNOUNCED. WE ALSO MUST HAVE CRITICAL DETAILS TO ENSURE WE ARE IMPLEMENTING APPROPRIATELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS POLICIES CHANGE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SHARED DECISION MAKING TO BE ENHANCED AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AT. SECOND QUESTION READS FROM ALL SOURCES HAVE COUNTIES HAD SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC AFFECTIVELY. AND THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MET THE CONTAINMENT WITHIN UNDER RESOURCE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS HAD SUFFICIENT RESOURCES WHICH IS WHY THE STATE HAS SUPPLEMENTED CONTACT TRACING AND TESTING EFFORTS LOCALLY. RESPONDING IS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE IT IS HELP TO INCREASE OUR STAFFING CAPACITY. READ AND IT'S IN EQUIPMENT AS NOT. A CROSS CAL LHD IS. TELL AND TRIPLING AND SIZE RESPONSE KOPET. NEWS STAFF ARE SOLD AS AFFECT AS WELL TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF. IN MADERA COUNTY WE CURRENTLY HAVE FORTY SIX EXTRA HELP TEMPORARY PEOPLE. THAT ARE HELPING WITH KOVIN. THAT REPRESENTS 30% OF OUR CURRENT- DEPARTMENT WORK FORCE AND 77% OF THE TEAM THAT'S DIRECTLY RESPONDING COVET OR EXTRA HELP SO ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THEY'VE ALL BEEN WORKING IN PUBLIC HEALTH FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. MANY OF THE STAFF. ARE FOR CONTACT TRACING AND DISEASE INVESTIGATION. PRIOR TO COVERT MADERA HAD THREE FULL TIME STAFF POSITIONS FOR CONTACT TRACING IT SEES INVESTIGATION. THREE WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE THIS TEAM TO MEET THE NEED TO RECHECK OUR LARGEST NUMBER DURING THE LAST SURGE WHICH INCLUDED. TEN PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF SIX COUNTY STAFF REDIRECTED FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS EIGHT STATES STAFF ASSIGNED TO MADERA. AND SIX STAFF WE TRAIN FROM A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT WAS CONTRACTED TO OUR REACHED A FORMER KURDS. THIS TOTALS THIRTY PEOPLE TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF OUR PERMANENT TEAM. WHEN THE PANDEMIC IS OVER UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT A NEW ONGOING INVESTMENT THIS WILL GO AWAY. QUESTION THREE HAVE SOME COUNTIES BETTER OR WORSE THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TOOLS EXPERTISE EXTENT ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT THEIR RESIDENTS. IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT SOME HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD HAVE MORE OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAN OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE SOME VERY SMALL JURISDICTIONS. THAT MAY ONLY HAVE A PART TIME EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND MAYBE ONLY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE AND MADERA COUNTY AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH WE HAD SIX FULL TIME PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND THREE NURSE INSURANCE FOR A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND. NOT ONLY WAS FUNDING NEEDED- BUT HAVING TRAINS THE WORKFORCE WITH EXPERTISE AND COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AS A VITAL FOR SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. RESOURCES SUCH AS VACCINES ACCESS TO TESTING PP AND DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SAXENA WAS ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS HOWEVER MANY AND MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES AND FEDERAL PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP I'M THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE UNCLEAR AND SO WITH INCOMPLETE DATA IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE ALLOCATION HAS BEEN EQUITABLE TO DATE. AS VACCINATION HEALTHCARE WORKERS IS COMPLETED WE ANTICIPATE ALLOCATIONS WILL REFLECT THE STATE PRIORITIZATION FOR HIGH RISK GROUPS. IDENTIFIED IN PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE INCLUDING. AGE SIXTY FIVE AND UP I MERGING SEA SERVICES CHILD CARE WORKERS EDUCATION. AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. NUMBER FIVE WHAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OUTSTANDING UNMET NEEDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT ARE SLOWING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ENDING OF THE PANDEMIC. WHAT SEVERAL OUT OF THAT E. L. C. FUNDING- ALSO REFERRED TO AND THE NEXT QUESTION UP THERE REALLY REMAINS ONE. ITEM THAT IS. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ON MATCH WHICH IS MORE VEXING. AND PREDICTABILITY OF VACCINE ALLOCATION. WITHOUT PREDICTABILITY OF WHAT'S COMING UP WE ARE UNABLE TO REALLY DO GOOD PLANNING ON THE GROUND IT TAKES A LONGER LEAD TIME TO EFFECTIVELY PLAN AND PROMOTE OUR POINTS OF DISPENSING AS WELL AS PLANNING FOR SECOND DOSES. AND THE LAST QUESTION HOW WILL COUNTY SPENDS THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN NEW FUNDING AND HOW CAN THE STATE ALL COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR SPENDING IT EFFICIENTLY AND EQUITABLY. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL USE FUNDING TO CONTINUE TESTING SITES CONTACT RAISING HIS INVESTIGATION ALSO SUPPORT THE RAMP OF THE VACCINES. MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO HOLD LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACCOUNTABLE TO EQUITY. SUCH AS THE POSITIVITY RATE AMONG CENSUS TRACTS WITH A LOW SCORE ON THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX IN THE- BOTTOM QUARTILE. I WILL CERTAINLY ACCOUNT FOR AND REPORT SPENDING TO SEE TEACHERS ARE. IT'S IMPORTANT. TO HOLE ALL TURN ACCOUNTABLE TO ECHO JUST DISTRIBUTION OF FACTS. AS WELL AS THE U. S. OF FUN SO. ADDRESSING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS MULTI COUNTY AND SHE'S LOCATIONS OF FEDERAL SITES AS WELL AS THE STATE AS WE ALL STRIVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET EQUITY. I ALSO HAVE A MORE DETAILED LISTS THAT I CAN PROVIDE WITH REGARDS TO. COMMON EXPENSES THAT ARE OUTSTANDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISS BOSS WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THIS PATRICK. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS I AM SEND YOUR HEADACHE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I HAVE ABOUT TWO COME MY PRESENT- I THINK YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THAT. M. IN ADDITION FOR THE VIEWERS ARE WATCHING ON THIS HANDOUT BE FOUND AT OUR WHICH AT L. A. R. DI CA DOT. I AM IF YOU I'M GOING AND MOVE TO ONE- MY PRESENTATION WILL REALLY BE FOCUS ON THE CO NINE. RESPOND WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC PUBLIC BUDGET INCLUDING THE MONEY THAT. OUT TO LOOK PUBLIC MEASURES FROM THE- I'M WHAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW. IS HOW. IT IS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. PUBLIC HEALTH JUST BY LOOKING AT THE ANNUAL BUDGET- IN LARGE PART THIS IS BECAUSE MINISTRATION HAS RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON. A WEAK YEAR. PRESSMAN'S AND IT'S CLEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELEASED IN JANUARY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS VERY FLUID APPROACH- WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AT MAYOR VISION SO MY IT REMARKS TODAY IT WILL ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESS SEES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO USE OVER THE REMAINING PART OF THE- I'M SORRY OVER THE REMAINING CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS- THOSE THAT THE WILL EMPLOYEE. IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I WILL THEN GO OVER SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S DISPOSAL FOR PRESSING ITS OWN GOALS AND PRIORITIES IN LIGHT OF THIS MORE SORT OF PIECEMEAL APPROACH BY THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN BECAUSE- THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH BY THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO VARIOUS ACTIONS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. WE OFFER SOME CRITERIA- THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE TO QUICKLY ASSESS THOSE PROPOSED ACTIONS AND THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH SOME ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. ONCE THE STATE ENTERS SORT OF THE RECOVERY PHASE OF THE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SO I AM PRETTY TO BE TWO OF THE HIM OUT- AS I KNOW PRE. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE ENACTED TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET IT REALLY DOES NOT TELL THE WHOLE STORY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S RESPONSE TO CODE NINETEEN. THEY MADE A NUMBER OF KEY ADJUSTMENTS SINCE THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED- INCLUDING ALLOCATION OF A SIGNIFICANT ARE GRANT FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AS WELL AS SOME GENERAL FUND FUND TRANSFERS- WHICH I'LL DISCUSS THAT PROCESS MORE IN A MINUTE. I AM SUMMIT THIS FUNDING HAS SUPPORTED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES INCLUDING OPENING THE STATE'S VALENCIA BRANCH LAB- TO INCREASE TESTING CAPACITY- TURNING TO PAGE THREE CONTRACTING WITH OPTUM SERVE FOR TEST COLLECTION. FUNDING INCREASE TESTING CAPACITY OF OTHER- A LABS- OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH LABS- AND FUNDING IMPROVEMENTS TO A T. SYSTEMS- AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES. I AM SO THE GUY BUT PROPOSAL IN A PER FOR THE- ANSWERED THE- BUDGET THAT WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY DID NOT INCLUDE A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CURRENT YEAR- AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE SOME VERY IMPORTANTISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. INCLUDING AS OTHERS HAVE DISCUSSED THE FUNDING AND MANAGEMENT OF VACCINATION EFFORTS THE FUNDING IN MANAGEMENT OF A SUSTAINED AND EXPANDED TESTING EFFORTS AND HOW TO SPEND A POTENTIAL FUTURE FEDERAL FUNDS. SO THE ADMINISTRATION- WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO RELY ON A MID YEAR BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS AND I'M GOING TO QUICKLY GO THROUGH THOSE PROCESS SEES SO THE FIRST IS CONTROL SECTION TWENTY BUDGET I'M SORRY BUDGET CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT- OFTEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET AND IT REALLY GIVES THE ADMINISTRATION THE ABILITY TO SPEND ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDS AND IT REQUIRES A THIRTY DAY ADVANCE. NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE. CONTROL ELEVEN POINT FIVE WAS A NEW SET ADDED WITH THE ENACTED. DIDN'T ACTED TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT BUT IT WAS SPECIFIC TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED- FROM LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN MARCH AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. THIS I'M CONTROL SECTION WERE REQUIRED ATTENDED VANCE NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE. NEXT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOR- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELIED ON FUNDING FROM THE STATE'S DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT ALSO KNOWN AS TRIO. THIS IS SOMEBODY SEAT SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC. WHICH CAN BE AND CAN BE USED DURING- A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. I'M IMPORTANTLY IT'S ONLY IT'S- ACTIVATED IN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY INCREMENTS AND IT'S ONLY OPERATIONAL DURING THE- THREE ONE FISCAL YEAR OR THE FISCAL YEAR WHEN THE LAST RENEWAL I TOOK PLACE SO IN THIS CASE IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL. YEAR WHICH ENDS JUNE THIRTIETH. AND IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THREE AT IS IT ROOF STATUTE REQUIRES THE ADMIN. TO KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT MAKES A TRANSFER FROM THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES INTO THE TRIO ACCOUNT BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE ALLOCATIONS- MADE FRIENDS RIO IT TO THE SPECIFIC- DEPARTMENTS AND HOW THAT FUNDING WILL BE USED. A FINAL- THAT I WOULDN'T ABOUT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SPENDING FUNDS IS THE FACT THAT DURING DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY- STATUTE ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOREGO USING. THE FORMAL BIDDING PROCESS FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTS SO JUST TO NAME AN EXAMPLE THE CONTRACT- THAT THE STATE ENTERED INTO WITH PERKIN ELMER TO OPEN THE VALENCIA BROWN SHOULD LAB- DID WAS NOT ENTERED INTO USING A BIDDING PROCESS. RIGHT NOW IF YOU'D TO PAGE. SIX- MOVING ON TO THE GUY BY PER. FOR ONE TWENTY TWO. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO LACKED A DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL CODE NINETEEN DID MINISTRATIONS OVERALL COMMIT NINETEEN. SPONSORED STRATEGY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HOW THE PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD SUPPORT THAT STRATEGY THE PRIMARY KNOWN EXPENDITURE. WOULD BE TO SUSTAIN OUT THE BOY YOU BRING WHILE AND SO OTHER AT ADD- AND. AS WELL AS SOME X. IN OTHER TO. TOTALING ONE FOUR BILL SO THAT APART OF PUBLIC HEALTH PLUS THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS TOTAL POINT FOUR BILLION SH IN MINISTRATION ALSO ESTIMATES THAT ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE NEEDED. FOR COVERT RESPONSE BUT IT HAS NOT YET ALLOCATED- THAT FUNDING TO SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO INDICATES A CONTINUED RELIANCE ON MIDYEAR BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS VIA BUDGET CONTROL SECTIONS SO IN ADDITION TO CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES A NEW CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE OR DECREASE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS FOR COVERT RESPONSE IT WOULD ALLOW TRANSFERS BETWEEN AND AMONG THOSE DEPARTMENTS AND IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE STATE TO SPEND. ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS. VERY IMPORTANT WE THIS CALL SO DOES NOT ANY NOTICE. OF THAT TO LARGEST. ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES CONTROL SECTIONAL LEVIN POINT NINE TWO WHICH WOULD EXTEND OF THE THREE- OF SORTIES- THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. BOTH OF THESE WILL GIVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION OVER SPENDING DECISIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT- IT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE A YEAR INTO THE CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE WE SUGGEST THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS OWN GOALS AND PRIORITIES FOR KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO HE TO PAGE. NINE SOME OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE LARGEST FOR A THESE GOAL AND- SENDING ONE TO THE ADMIN. WESTING OR INFORMATION ABOUT SUB COMMITTEE HERE SUCH AS THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TODAY BY THE- OF REQUEST OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. INCLUDING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET ACT. IN REQUIRING ROBUST FOLLOW UP REPORTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- IN ITS- THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REQUEST MORE ROBUST REPORTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT RESPONDS TO IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOTIFICATIONS OF MID BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS. NO JUST EXAMPLES OF WHAT SOME OF THE PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO EXPRESS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THOSE LISTED ON PAGE NINE I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THOSE BUT IT MAY INCLUDE ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF AN ACCESS TO VACCINES. IT COULD BE- ENSURING THAT THE STATE HAS AN ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN SURVEILLANCE PLAN AFTER CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IT COULD BE TURNING TO PAGE TEN. CURRENT THE MINUTES FOR MORE MODELING OF THE NEED FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE NEW COVER NINETEEN VARIANTS THAT ARE SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE. PROCESS RELATED GOAL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY WISH TO EXPRESS TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS. NOT MAKING MODIFICATIONS TO SOME OF THE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE PROPOSALS- FIRST. FOR ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE REQUIRING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY NOTIFYING THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT INTENDS TO- MAKE CHANGES ACROSS DEPARTMENTS. I'M IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE COULD POTENTIALLY- REQUIRED THAT THE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION WHAT IT DOES MAKE A NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM THAT THE FUNDING IS INTENDING TO ADDRESS AND HOW IT WILL ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. GIVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO PROPOSALS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON PAGE TEN WE ALSO OFFER SOME KEY CRITERIA THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE WHILE ASSESSING THESE PROPOSALS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE I'VE BEEN GIVEN A PROPOSAL SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S THE GOAL OF THE INTENDED ACTION. HOW DOES THAT GOAL FIT INTO THE STATE'S OVERALL CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE AND STRATEGY. TURNING TO PAGE AWAY THE TEN FOR OF THE PROPOSED ACTION WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT- SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT EVIDENCE HAS THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED THAT THIS- POST ACTION WILL ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE HAVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. FEASIBILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CRITERIA IN TERMS OF- IS THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL IS MORE STAFFING NEEDED. IT HAS THE DEPARTMENT- IF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WILL BE EXPECTED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL HAS THAT BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN IN THE PROPOSAL WHAT'S THE TIME LINE AND IS THAT TIMELINE FEASIBLE. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW WITH THE PROPOSED ACTION AFFECT- DIFFERENT. GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE WHAT IT WHAT IT WORKS AND DISPARITIES ARE IMPROVE DISPARITIES. ON PAGE TWELVE A FINAL CRITERION WOULD BE FUNDING. ISSUES RELATED TO FUNDING AND CONTRACTING SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ARE THE FUNDING SOURCES PROPOSED- AND IT FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S FEDERAL FUNDING DOES THE PROPOSAL INCLUDE ELIGIBLE USES OF FEDERAL FUNDING- IF IT'S STATE FUNDED HOW WITH THE EFFORTS COMPLEMENT FEDERAL EFFORTS. AND THEN FINALLY ON ON CONTRACTING. AND HOW MANY COMPANIES OR APPROACHES TO THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER FOR THE PROPOSED ACTION AND IS THE VENDOR THAT THEY ARE INTENDING TO SELECT THE BEST VALUE FOR THE STATE. NOW FOR. IF YOU WERE TO PAGE THIRD WE A FEW FOR. CONSIDER AS THE STATE- ONE THE STATE MOVES INTO THEIR INCOME PHASE OF THE PANDA. SO THE FIRST IS TO A- CODE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH. NEEDS BOTH NEAR AND LONGER TERM. SO COMMON EIGHTEEN COULD A PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT- BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP A NUMBER OF RESOURCES. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE THAT OULD BE LEVERAGED IN THE NEAR TERM AND POTENTIALLY EVEN ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THIS COULD THIS INCLUDES OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LAB CAPACITY INCLUDING THE NEW VALENCIA. BRANCH PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AS WAS MADE- AS BUYER REPRESENTATIVE FROM CAN- SOME OF THE VERY RESEARCH PARTNERS. IN DATA SURE AGREE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE I. T. SYSTEM. A MERGER WE READ. THAT THE JUST OUR THE ADMIN ABOUT ITS FOR MAINTAIN COVERT NINETEEN. COULD PASS OVER THE NEXT YEARS. A SECOND KEY ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS TO OF FIND OUT WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN DEFERRED AS THE FOCUS HAS REALLY NEEDED TO BE ON COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASK SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHICH RESPOND RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN DEFERRED IN WHAT WOULD BE% NEEDED TO RECOVER IN THOSE AREAS. FINALLY WE- THAT THE LEGISLATURE. CONSIDER FINDING AN AFTER ACTION REVIEW TO LEARN FROM THE PANDEMIC. AS WE ALL KNOW THE COVER NINETEEN KADAMPA PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS INCLUDING I'M NOT AMONG OTHERS I UNDER RESOURCE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE OUTDATED IT SYSTEMS SIGNIFICANT RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES. COORDINATION PROBLEMS IN PUBLIC HEALTH GOVERNANCE. AND INADEQUACIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THERE ARE OF STUDIES CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION ONE IS IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THAT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON. LOOKING AT DOING A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS- FOCUSED ON EQUITY THERE'S ANOTHER ASSEMBLY BILL THAT PROPOSES AN ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE A COMPREHENSIVE AFTER ACTION REVIEW- IN THIS REVIEW REALLY SHOULD ASSESS WHAT WENT WELL AND WHAT DID NOT GO SO WELL WITH THE STATE'S RESPONSE AND IT SHOULD. SERVE AS A BASIS FOR REMEDIATING- THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED- WE SUGGEST THAT THELEGISLATURE COULD USE SOME OF THE ONE TIME WINDFALL THAT'S EXPECTED. I IN THE NEXT YEAR FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE TO FUND THE STUDY. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MR BURKE. I WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE CMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE- VICE CHAIR OF BUDGET ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG FOLLOWED BY. MEMBER FRAZIER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FIRST WANT TO STORE WITH- THE PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR FROM THE DAY- I'M TRYING TO I'M I'M I'VE GOT TO SCENARIOS ARE TO TWO WORLD THAT I'M A VERY TO GET WELL. THE WORLD THAT YOU LIVE. AND THE WORLD AS HE P. IN SO FROM FIRST. DO YOU IN REAL TIME. OR WEEKLY OR- I GUESS IT WOULD MAKE MAYBE CAN TELL ME HOW OFF DO YOU GET YOUR ALLOCATIONS INFORMATION OF ALLOCATIONS DO YOU KNOW. I'M DOSES OF ARE. INTO YOUR CAL. AND YOU KNOW HOW VACCINE ARE BEING ADMINISTERED. ON A DAILY BASIS. WE RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION OF ALLOCATION. TWICE WEEKLY- I'M AT THIS POINT IT IT'S STILL ALLOCATED IT BASED ON FIRST DIBS ISN'T SECOND DOSES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE WILL TRANSITION TO A SINGLE OCCASION AND IT DOES IS IT DOES RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING IT. ON TUESDAYS AND ON SUNDAYS SO IT'S BROKEN INTO PIECES- AND THAT IS OUR ALLOCATION FOR THE WEEK. AND WE PLAN BASED ON THAT NOTIFICATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY INDICATION OF WHAT NEXT WEEK'S ALLOCATION IS GOING TO BE. THIS WEEK BY WEEK- AND DOES THAT ALLOCATION INCLUDE- THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL HOSPITALS THAT YOU MENTIONED OR WHAT'S GOING TO CVS AND WALGREENS. NO IT DOES NOT THAT IS JUST THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALLOCATION WE DON'T SEE THE ALLOCATIONS YEAH GO TO THE PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP OR MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES. THERE ARE THREE SO AND THIS IS CORRELATED I'M TRYING TO COOPERATE OF COURSE WHAT WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN KERN COUNTY SO THERE ARE THREE BUCKETS OF VACCINES THAT ARE COMING INTO YOUR COUNTY AND TO KERN COUNTY AND OTHER COUNTIES. AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE A WAY TO ANALYZE. ALL OF IT TOGETHER. THAT'S CORRECT. AND I KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OUT THEY JUST RELEASED THEIR DASHBOARD IN TERMS OF VACCINES. VACCINES BEING ADMINISTERED IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU TO VERIFY THAT THE DATA THAT'S ON THAT DASHBOARD TO THE PUBLIC AND WHAT YOU KNOW. IS BEING ADMINISTERED BY YOUR CLINICS AND- AND INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR COUNTY. IN THIS LAST WEEK WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WHICH THEY HAVE SENT TO US THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE- FOR- ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE PROVIDERS THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ALLOCATE TO. US SO NOT THE PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP AND NOT THE MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES BUT WE ALLOCATED OUT TO OTHER LIKE FQHCS AND HOSPITAL AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS LET'S SAY. AND SO THEY PROVIDED US WHAT THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF DATA AND WORK IN THE MIDDLE OF A RECONCILIATION PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA THAT THEY SEE. IS WHAT'S pISSUES AND THINGS THAT ARE BEING RESOLVED CURRENTLY. OCCUR SO I GUESS HE ANSWERED MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH IS THE DATA DOESN'T. TECHNICALLY CORLEY AT THE MOMENT. WHERE YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS YOU HAVE ARE NOT EXACTLY THE NUMBERS ON THE DASHBOARD THEY DON'T MATCH UP. CORRECT WE'RE RECONCILING THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATE. OKAY AND- SO I GUESS MAYBE IS A BIG FOR THE FOUR OR FOUR C. PH N. AND ANYONE ANSWER THIS QUESTION I GUESS IS. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIR TODAY THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS VACCINATED THAT INFORMATION HAS TO BE UPLOADED. INTO THE COMPACT SYSTEM. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN YES. AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE COMPLIANT WITH THAT THERE ARE SOME PROVIDERS. THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT REQUIREMENT. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IS SOME OF THE PROVIDERS THAT REACH OUT TO VERY SPECIFIC VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HOUSING CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO THE DATA SIDE OF THINGS AND SO IT IT EQUITY AND EFFICIENCY MAY NOT. REALLY OVERLAP VERY WELL IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IF WE'RE GOING STRICTLY FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF VACCINE OUT THE DOOR AND GREAT DATA TRANSPARENCY. THAT'S IDEAL BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE TRAINING AN ONBOARDING WITH PROVIDERS THAT SPECIFICALLY REACH OUT TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS WELL. FOR WHAT WOULD BE THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE SOLUTION THERE I MEAN IF BECAUSE OF COURSE. I MEAN MY PARENTS GOT THEIR FIRST DOSE AND SO I WOULD IF THEY LOSE THEIR CARD I WOULD WANT THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA. IS CORRECT WHEN THEY GO BACK TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE RIGHT BACKS IN THE SECOND TIME SO. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE. AND PUT IN ON A TIMELY BASIS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THINGS IN REAL TIME. WE CAN SEE THINGS IN REAL TIME AND CDPH CAN SEE THINGS IN REAL TIME. SO WHAT WOULD BE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS LONG AS IT INDIVIDUAL IS RETURNING TO THE SAME PROVIDER. THAT PROVIDER WILL HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR FIRST DOSE FOR SECOND DOSES. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT DATA ACCURACY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE STATE SYSTEM. AND WE AGREE IT IT NEEDS TO BE ACCURATE AND NEEDS TO BE TIMELY. WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS. REALLY WORKING WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO IDENTIFY THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING VACCINE EQUITY. WHAT WHAT ALSO NEED SUPPORT WITH REGARDS TO THE DATA ENTRY. AND ACCURACY ON THAT SIDE AND THAT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME. WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THOSE. IMPORTANT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDING VACCINE ON THE GROUND. TWO GLOBAL POPULATIONS. BUT NEED TO ONBOARD THEM APPROPRIATELY. HOW KERN. AND THEN I GO TO CVS AS A SINCE I HAVE. THIS IS A I HAVE YOU IN TERMS OF YOU YOU MAY A STATE. THAT HE WOULD- PREFERRED SHARE DECISION MAKING- COULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN A WHERE THEY WAS A CHAIRED MAKING A ONE THAT COULD HAVE IMPROVE- I DON'T PUT ON THE SPOT I'M JUST TRYING TO INTERNET WE JUST WANTED TO IT MAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT- I'M PRESENTING IT ACCURATELY. I THINK ONE EXAMPLE IS- THE THIRD PARTY- I THINK THE THAT HAS BEEN MIXED. UP THERE DETERMINATION TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WAS A DECISION THAT WAS MADE. AND BROUGHT AS A MAY DECISION TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND WE RAISE OUR CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO THAT AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM TO WORK THROUGH THAT ISSUE- THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF. A DECISION FULLY COMPLY DONE. WITHOUT OUR INPUT PRIOR TO DECISION BEING MADE. I APPRECIATE IF THIS IS. IF DOCTOR PAN OR PERCEIVED IS AVAILABLE. I GUESS MAYBE. HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THOSE CAN. BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR MADERA. SORRY I DON'T KNOW MIDDLETOWN ERNEST FINELLI MAY BE ON. FIVE HI THIS IS ANOTHER. I'M NOT SURE. BUT. OKAY IS FIRST OFF ON THE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE A MAX I THINK THAT'S WHAT. SITUATION AND WHICH WE WERE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO UP OUR- AND WE DON'T GET ANY MORE ON UNTIL WE SEE ALLOCATE WE- WORD OF TO GET LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT ABOUT LEVEL ON BACK COMING HOME AND SO YEAH I THINK I A QUESTION FOR. PART AND OF HOW DO WE GET INFO ON TO WHAT COMING AND SO THAT WE CAN SHARE THAT WITH OUR LOCAL. I'M I THINK THAT WE HAVE TRIED OUR BEST TO- BRING IN OUR LOCAL BUT I THINK THAT- YEAH THEY ARE RIGHT AND NOT SOMETIME WE MOVE QUICKLY THE SOMETHING THAT. WE DON'T SHARE AS MUCH- AND GET AS MUCH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ON THE WE BY ABOUT IN THE FUTURE. AS OUR ANOTHER CAR. I STILL DOESN'T SO THEY ACTUALLY THAT'S A GREAT TRANSIT TO. MY MIGHT SAID OF QUESTIONS FOR PH. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE VACCINE CAN. SUPPLY SO FOR WHAT DOES INTO THIS CAN. THEN HOW. HE TO TERM. HOW MANY DOES IT COUNTY. RECEIVES A THERE A FOR. THAT USES. BASED ON TO BASED ON PUBLIC SIZE. BASED ON. CAPACITY MAIN WHAT ARE THE INFO AND WHAT DO YOU UP WITH THAT EXACT NUMBER. SURE AND DOES CHANGE OVER TIME SO WE REALLY WILL AT WHAT IS THE THAT WERE TRYING TO FAX A UP THE TIME THAT WE THE EARLY DAYS WHERE. WE WERE DOING ON PAGE ONE EIGHT WAS REALLY FUN ON THE HEALTH WORKER. AND SO AND LONG CARE AND- REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT PERCENT OF THOSE WERE IN EACH COUNTY OF BUT BASIC FOR THE FARM. WE DID CHAIRED BY AIM FOR WITH THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY LOCAL. CARE- HOW MANY HELP WORKERS FOR BOTH IN CASE- I DO UNDER THAT OTHER FOR COUNTY IS AND HER OF P. WORKING IN ONE COUNTY WE AND I COUNTY VOTING FOR YOU KNOW OUR HARD. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OP. FOR SHERIFF TO WAY AND THOSE NUMBERS. AS WE MOVE TO PHASE ONE BEING- WE ARE. TO SHIP THAT- FORMING. I WE TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE- FOR STARTING WITH. SEVENTY YEAR OLD AN OLD. AND THEN IN COURT THE TO BY YEAR OLDER AND THEN MOVE TOWARD SOME OF THE- POPULATE SO I THINK IT ALWAYS POPULAR. OF PROPORTION OF PARTY GIRL WITHIN THE COUNTY SO THAT WE HAVE OFTEN SHARED DATA COUNTY BUT- TO- OF TECH ASSISTANCE AND GOING THE NUMBER SO THAT CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHY THEY ARE GETTING THE ALLOCATE THAT THERE GETTING. SO ARE THOSE NUMBERS FROM THE CENSUS DATA OR DO YOU. THOSE NUMBER ARE AT THE DESK PROVIDE YOU THOSE NUMBERS OR YOU. DO YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS AND GIVE THEM THAT COUNTY. THE COMMITTEE OR THE CHAIRED WITH THAT THAT THAT THE FORMULA FOR THAT. YEAH WE- IS THAT CHANGING FORMULA FOR WE CAN- TELL YOU LIKE WHAT AT WHAT POINT WE CHANGED THE FORMULA AND WHAT WE CHANGED IT TO COVER HAS CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THE TEARS ARE AS WE MOVE THROUGH. AS YOU ADD ADDITIONAL ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS THAT FORMULA BEGINS TO ADJUST CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY AND IN TERMS OF THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL HOSPITAL SYSTEMS DO YOU HAVE A SAY S. C. PH AND WHERE. THOSE SUPPLIES WHERE THEY GET DISTRIBUTED OR DOES. THAT THE COUNTY DO THEY GOTTA SAY OR IS THE SYSTEM DETERMINE WHERE THE DOSES GO. DO NOT GET A SAY- IT IS- CDPH IN COORDINATION WITH BY MINISTRATION WHO DETERMINES WHAT PERCENTAGE GOES TO THAT I'M FEES. OKAY THE CDPH DETERMINES THAT ALLOCATION FROM THE SYSTEM. I'M IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MINISTRY. SO THEN WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT. ASSESSMENT TO THE COUNTIES BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MISSING PIECE AND WHAT GOES INTO EACH CATEGORY THAT REPORTING THAT ON TO OUR- PUBLIC WEBSITE SO THAT YOU CAN TELL THE TOTAL DOSE IS GOING TO EACH AND SEE WHETHER THAT'S A STATE OR A MULTI COUNTY. MC I THINK WHERE IT BECOMES CHALLENGING AND WE'RE WORKING ON IS HOW MANY DOSES GET ADMINISTERED IN EACH COUNTY THAT PROGRAM C. E. SERVICES AND SO THAT'S THE DATA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON BUT CHINESE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. WHAT BENEFIT EACH MCD PROVIDES TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS OKAY SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO COMPARE WITH THE MADERA PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE A SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. THE OTHER THREE BUCKETS HELLO I THINK SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS HOW MANY DOSES ARE PROVIDED TO MADERA COUNTY FROM THE M. C. E. I'M NOT IT'S NOT YEP AND SHARE- THAT HAS A MAJOR. OKAY WITH THAT SURE THAT THE OR- WE'RE WORKING ON THAT DATA AND TRYING TO GIVE MORE DIRECTION SO THAT WE ASWE MOVE ON INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE GET BACK TRANSPARENCY OF DATA SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. NOT ONLY THE DOSES THAT THEY'RE ADMINISTERING OR ALLOCATING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT ALSO THE LAW TO BEING BROUGHT INTO ON THAT COMMUNITY OR THAT COUNTY FROM- BMC'S. OKAY SO SEVEN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG AND IT IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT I'M TOLD IS THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DASHBOARD THAT YOU'VE THAT IS NOW EXTERNAL. THAT WE CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF DOSES BEING ADMINISTERED DOES THAT INCLUDE. THE THREE BUCKETS THAT WAS OUTLINED ITS THEY COUNTY ALLOCATION THAT MULTIPLIES SECTIONAL AND THE CVS WALGREENS AND THE PHARMACY PARTNERSHIPS THAT IS ALL INCLUDED ALL PUBLIC SITE THAT IS ALL INCLUDED IN THE DASHBOARD GAS OKAY BUT THE KEY. SAYS WIRES AND THE COUNTIES THE PART COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES THEY DON'T THEY SEE THAT NUMBER BUT THEY DON'T SEE THE- THE THREE THEY DON'T SEE A BROKEN OUT INTO THREE WAYS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BREAK THAT OUT INTO. EACH COUNTY FOR THE MC IS RIGHT NOW. OKAY YOU MAY ASK WHY THAT IS I AM JUST CURIOUS I JUST I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T KNOW SO I JUST. THINK THEY'RE WORKING WITH BMC'S TO PROVIDE BETTER DATA- IN TERMS OF WHERE EXACTLY THEY'RE ADMINISTERING THOSE DOSES ACROSS THEIR MANY. FACILITIES IN THE STATE. OKAY AND SOME OF IT AS A LOT OF. AS BY I'M IN. THERE ARE SOME. CODE ON SOME ISSUE ARE. PEOPLE USING MULTIPLE CODE OR MULTI ORGAN- THAN ONE. FOR THE WHICH MAKE IT HARD TO PARTICULARLY. NOT THOSE DIRECTLY BUT WE ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK RIGHT NOW WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND WITH THE DATA TEAM AT THE STATE. TO REALLY MAPPED OUT ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CODE SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER PICTURE AND HOPING TO HAVE THAT VERY SOON. OKAY I THINK THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD WOULD LIKE THAT TO SEE THAT INFORMATION AS WELL SO IF THAT COULD DIFFERENCE PROVIDED- AND I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS. MISTER JACK- IN TERMS OF. SO FORGET MY SOME. BY SAID. IN TERMS OF THAT. THE AMOUNT OF DOES IS BEING ADMINISTERED. IF THE DATA EVENTUALLY ANY WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A PLUS OR MINUS A DAY OR TWO IF ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS UPLOADED INTO THE COMPACT SYSTEM WHY COULDN'T I WOULDN'T WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST PULL THE COUNTY DATA THE NUMBER OF VACCINES BEING ADMINISTERED IN EACH COUNTY AND GIVE IT TO THE COUNTIES FOR THEM. TO VERIFY OR THAT OR THE ARE THERE MULTIPLE INPUTS INTO THE COMPACT SYSTEM THAT PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT IS A MYERS ANY HAS TO BE 100% ACCURATE. YEAH THERE ARE MULTIPLE DATA SYSTEM ABOUT PULL DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA ABOUT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER SO THERE'S THAT CARE DATA WHICH SHOWED BE ADMINISTERED. DOSE SAYS THERE'S ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT SHOWS THE SHIP DOES MOVE BEARS. ON ANOTHER. SYSTEM THAT SHOWS THE INVENTORY OF WALK ON HAND AND EACH PROVIDERS PM VERY TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND BECAUSE OUR PHONES ARE A MULTITUDE OF SYSTEMS THAT INFORMATION HAS TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER- AND WE ARE SHARING THAT WITH THE COUNTIES NOW AND THAT IS. WHAT WE'RE I'M USING TO REALLY CLEAN UP THAT DATA AND I THINK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WE'VE GOTTEN PRETTY FAR IN TERMS OF THE ORG CODES MATCHING AND REALLY. UNDERSTANDING HOW WE GOT TO CLEAN THAT UP SO THAT WE CAN INDEED PROVIDE. JUST WHAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR. AND HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLEAN CLEAN UP THE- IT TAKEN OUT WHILE I'M IN ITS FIRST IN BRINGING ALL THAT DATA FROM THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS INTO ONE PLACE WHICH WE'VE NOW DONE- AND THEN IT REALLY IS A PROCESS OF THOUSANDS OF CODES IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER SO. YOU KNOW WE WISH IT COULD BE FASTER BUT WE THINK WE ARE ALMOST THERE. AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE DOES THIS EXIST FOR OTHER. DISEASES AND DATA THAT'S COLLECTED FROM OTHER DISEASES AND OTHER VACCINES. I DON'T THINK THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR FOR OTHER VACCINES OF THE CARE SYSTEM REALLY DOES WORK FOR CHILDHOOD VACCINES AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE. I THINK WE HAVE. SOME FOLKS HAVE SAID IN THIS HEARING YEAH THE SYSTEMS WEREN'T DESIGNED TO DO WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IN THIS PANDEMIC AND I THINK WE'RE ALL LEARNING. ABOUT HOW TO CREATE SYSTEMS WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BRING UP INTO THE FUTURE OKAY AND THEN JUST. SO THAT WHEN THE LA DODGERS STADIUM AND PACO PARK AND CAL EXPO FAIRGROUNDS WHEN THOSE SITES ARE LAUNCHED- OR BEING ARE I DOUBT THAT A LARGE ARE THEY PART OF THE COUNTY ALLEN. ALLOTMENT OR THEY SEPARATE ON TOP OF WHAT THE COUNTY GETS BI WEEKLY. I THINK IT UPON US. IS SO OF THE FEDERAL SITES BETTER COMING IN THROUGH FEMA WILL BRING THEIR OWN DOSES- AND- THAT ARE ON TOP OF WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE GETTING. IN OTHER CASES WE HAVE- RELIED ON A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY AND USING SOME OF THE COUNTY ALLOCATIONS. AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE WITH PROVIDERS OR ENTITIES THAT ARE RUNNING SOME OF THOSE SITES AND RELYING ON THE- ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY RECEIVED SO IT REALLY IS A MAX. OKAY AND MY LAST QUESTION IS AND I HOPE YOU CAN JUST PROVIDE SOME BIG JUST CLARITY ON THIS. ARE WE AND ONE B. I WE'VE ACTION ADDING ONE BE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE WEBSITE. A CITY BASED WEBSITE SAYS THAT WE ARE IN ONE B. AND THEN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CDPH GUIDANCE IT SAYS THE PRIORITIZE ONE A. AND SIXTY FIVE AND UP FIRST AND SAID THAT. MY COUNTY AND I WON'T SPEAK FOR OTHER COUNTIES. THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S SOME BUT THERE'S SOME CONFUSION. BECAUSE THOSE AND ONE BE WANT TO GO AND GET VACCINATED. SO IS IT ARE WE CAN CURRENTLY VACCINATING ONE B. NOW OR IS IT A WE PRIORITIZE IN ONE DAY AND SIXTY FIVE IN A- AND THEN WAIT AND WAITING FOR. ONE BEAD BUYING SUPPLIES. ONE B. IS ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED RIGHT NOW- WE'RE STANDING KNEELING TO FINISH BLOCKS AND ENDING ON A- AND COUNTIES ARE IN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PLACES IN TERMS OF HOW FAR THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO THE ONE BE ON MAXIMIZATION SEPTEMBER FOCUSING ON YEAH BUT IT'S NOT THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE SO SIXTY FIVE AN OPT AND THE THREE SECTORS ARE ELIGIBLE AT THE SAME TIME. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF VACCINES YOU CAN'T DO EVERYBODY OUT LONG TERM SO THEY ARE- PRIORITIZING- SOMETIMES THE SEVENTY FIVE YEAR AND OLDER AND THEN MOVING TO THE SIXTY FIVE AND MOVING ACROSS THE SECTOR SO I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL ELIGIBLE THE QUESTION IS GIVEN THE LIMITED VACCINE HOW MUCH CAN THEY- YEAH REALLY- HANDLE IN TERMS OF. REALLY HAVING THE SITE DELIVER THE. VACCINE TO THE APPROPRIATE GROUPS.SO BOTH ARE CORRECT SO THE COUNTIES ARE DOING THEY CAN CURRENTLY THEY'RE RIGHT AND THEY CAN IS THERE PRIVATIZING AND WAITING ALL RIGHT. WHY I THINK WE'RE WHAT I'M SAYING IS EVERYBODY IS L. A. AND ONE B. TIER ONE THAT INCLUDES THE SIXTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER AS WELL AS THE THREE SECTORS. AND SO HOW THE COUNTIES ARE SUB PRIORITIZING TO ADDRESS THAT GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT THEY HAVE IN EACH OF THOSE POPULATIONS MAY VARY A LITTLE BIT. AND SO THE TIMING MAY VARY BUT THE GROUP IS STILL ELIGIBLE ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE GENERALLY THIS IS GONNA BE ADDRESSED TO THE WHOLE PANEL TODAY AND I JUST WANTED AS THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE INTELLECTUALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED IN CALIFORNIA. IN WITH- MY COLLEAGUE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE TEARS. I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO YOU TO ADDRESS THE- HE A POSSIBILITIES OF MOVING UP THE I. D. D. POPULATION. IN THE INTERIOR ONE B. JUST JUST IN THE GENERALITY OF. WITH THE AND YOU LOOK AT THEY ARE AS LIKELY TO GET INFECTED AS ANYBODY ELSE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IF THEY ARE INFECTED- WITH THIS POPULATION IT'S HARD TO COMMUNICATE A LOT OF THE TIMES THAT. IF THEY'RE BUILT. ON THEIR CARE GIVERS- NEED TO HAVE PRESIDENT'S ALSO. AND I'M JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO- MOVING THE DIALOGUE I'VE SHARED SOME STUFF WITH DDS AS FAR AS THE CDC RECOMMENDATIONS. GOING FOR WITH DOWN SYNDROME CHILDREN. AND DOWN'S SYNDROME ADULTS HOW SUSCEPTIBLE THEY ARE AND- I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE TODAY ABOUT WHY THIS POPULATION HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. AS A PRIORITY WITH A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SOMETHING THOUSAND- PEOPLE IN THIS IN THIS COMMUNITY. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT ADDRESSED AND- MADE A PRIORITY GOING FORWARD. HELLO DOCTOR OF THE LAW BUT A GAUNTLET OF THE CDPH. SO YOU WERE RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT STATE DEFINING EXACTLY AS YOU'RE DESCRIBING. TWO SEPARATE SEPARATE CATEGORIES ONE IS PERSONS WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT PUT THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS FROM CORRECT NINETEEN. THEY'RE WORKING THOSE- THE NEW DISABILITIES. THE HELP DRAFTING GUIDELINES GROUP THAT'S WORKING ON THE SPECIFICS THEY WERE MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. HERE TO DISCUSS HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THAT SO THAT IS THAT IS MOVE FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY OVER THE NEXT. OKAY YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE DETAILS. AND SO THAT WILL ADDRESS THE M. MO BELT WON'T IMMOBILITY OF IT. I DID THE ADULTS IN THESE GROUP HOMES IN ALL OF THE ABILITIES TO GET THESE THESE RESOURCE TO THEM BECAUSE WE DID THE NURSING FACILITIES WE DID. THE PRISONS WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DRESSING THERE IN MOBILITY TO BE ABLE TO THE ADULT POPULATION WHO. RIGHT IN LARGE WE TOOK OUT OF THE- THE CENTERS THE DISABILITY CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AS WE DEMONIZE THEM. AND NOW THERE ARE AT RISK SO I REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THE OF MOBILITY COMPONENT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DISPERSE TO THESE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T GET TO. THE SITES. YES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY SO WE MET LAST WEEK WE WERE MEETING WITH. A TEAM OF STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO DEAL IT SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT ISSUE WE REALIZED. REALLY THAT THAT POPULATION IS GOING TO REQUIRE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION. BOTH NOT JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL- DISABILITIES BUT WHETHER THEIR HOME GROUND TRANSPORTATION- AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WORK WOULD BE A LITTLE APPROACH OR AGAIN TAKING IS THAT ANY DOOR IN THE RIGHT DOOR. TO GET VACCINATED. AND WE'RE MEETING EVERY WEEK WITH THEM TO COME UP WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ADDRESS THE. ISSUE THAT YOU'RE A PRODUCT. THANK YOU LOOK FOR TO SUBMIT THAT PLAY TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER WHO MADE A SPECIAL TRIP AND TODAY TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT AND FOR ALWAYS STANDING UP FOR OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT.

THERE'S BEEN REPORTS THAT THE WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINTS- REGARDING UNLICENSED AND UNSUPERVISED PERSONNEL IN THE VALENCIA LAB DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR ANY REPORTS ON THAT. IT'S CURRENTLY UNDER- INVESTIGATE INVESTIGATION SO THE STATE IS LOOKING INTO THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOKING INTO THAT. WELL WE KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT THE WORK WE DO WE DO KNOW ABOUT THE REPORTS WE HAVE- INVESTIGATORS JOHN IN THE LANCIA. AND I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS OF WHERE THEY'RE AT BUT- THE STATE IS TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE ALLEGATIONS. DO YOU HAVE A TIME FRAME AS TO WHEN THAT INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE COMPLETED. I'M NOT IN THERE I'M NOT A LABORATORY EXPERTS I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW QUICKLY IT'S GOING TO BE- IT HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO BE COMPLETED BUT BUT I KNOW THAT- I DO KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE- REGULATORS. AND DO THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THE CERTIFIED LAB THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEY'RE VERY EXPERIENCED IN DOING THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS. SO WE DO HAVE WE DO HAVE- THE EXPERTISE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO DO TO DO THIS INVESTIGATION BUT I. I STILL DIDN'T GET. I'M SORRY. HI WE DO HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF THE INSPECTORS BUT I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE- SO CAN I ASK FOR AN UPDATE FOR THE COMMITTEE PLEASE AND- YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT- IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN GET A REGULAR UPDATE ON THE HOW THE INVESTIGATION IS GOING. I WILL GIVE ME I WILL COMMUNICATE THAT I'VE NOT **** I WILL COMMUNICATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS REQUEST IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT I'M NOT SURE WHAT- LET ME LET ME FIND OUT HOW THAT WORKS LIKE I SAID I'M NEW HERE THIS IS MY SIX WEEK- SO I WILL BUT I WILL FIND OUT HOW THEY COMMUNICATE THIS TYPE OF- EVENT. PUBLICLY THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT OVER THERE THAT ARE NOT NEW THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO- HELP- DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HELP IF I. DRIVE A LETTER I. REQUEST YEAH I KNOW I THINK- YEAH I THINK THAT'S- THAT ON THE BURKE. THANK YOU THEN THE NEXT QUESTION- SOUL SOUL WHEN OF THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THE LAND SELLOUT THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT THAT I WOULD BE DOING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A COUPLE WEEKS AWAY SO HOW MANY TESTS. PER DAY IN THE LAB DOING CURRENTLY. PACKSIZE DR PANDIT THINK WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT INFORMATION- I ANYWAY WE'LL GO OVER PART BACK TO ON THE NUMBERS WE DO GET A DAILY REPORT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE DAILY REPORT NUMBER WAS FROM YESTERDAY. I DON'T HAVE IT IN MY TRAINING. YEAH WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR SO FIVE IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN. AT LEAST HELP ME WITHA NUMBER- BY THE END OF THE MEETING TODAY. OKAY THANK YOUNG. AND THAT CA- LET'S SEE- AND THEN THIS IS- IN TERMS OF THE PRICING WHEN THE VIOLENCE AT LEVELS ARE OPEN THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT THE PRICE OF PROTEST WOULD BE THIRTY DOLLARS PER TEST AT MAXIMUM- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT. BECAUSE PROTEST IS RIGHT NOW NUMBER ONE. AND- WHAT HAS BEEN THE AVERAGE OF THE TESTS- SINCE INCEPTION. YEAH- I DO I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION- WHAT WE DID WE TRANSCRIBER PAIRING FOR THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED BUT IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE WILL WE WILL- TAKE THIS INFORMATION BACK AND K. AND- GET BACK TO YOU. OKAY LET'S SEE. THE AND THEN ON THERE WAS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT- THAT THERE WAS NO BID PROCESS FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTS SPECIFIC TO THE VIOLENCE A LAB CAN YOU TELL ME WHY THAT WAS. WHAT AND THEN TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT AND WHAT IS THE ALLELES- ASSESSMENT OF THE NO BID CONTRACT. I A ONE UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS NO BID. ARE NOT BIDDING PROCESS. MISS PATRICK CAN YOU ANSWER ASSEMBLYMEMBER REVEALS QUESTION. HELLO AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AND WHEN THE STATE IS UNDER DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT OBLIGATED TO USE A FORMAL BIDDING PROCESS TO ENTER INTO PUBLIC CONTRACTS- WE HAVE NOT DONE AS SEPARATE ASSESSMENT OF THE PERKIN ELMER CONTRACTS AND YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE OR SUCCESSFUL SO I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT THAT'S THE REASON THE DEEP THE MINISTRATION DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NO BID CONTRACTS FROM THE STATE OF EMERGENCY- AND OUR COMMENT WAS THAT- YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO REQUEST MORE INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE- ABOUT THE VENDORS THAT IT USES TO WORK WITH. THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF VIOLENCE ALLOWED LIKE WHERE DID WE COME UP WITH- YOU KNOW VERSUS ANY OTHER- TESTING LABS UP ACROSS THE STATE SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW I CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY PICKED ON VALENCIA- DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS. AS TO HOW I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER QUESTION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THEM. I MEAN THERE IS A COPY OF THE CONTRACT ON- THE CODE NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE BUT- I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING FOR YOU KNOW MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TRICAN ELMER WAS CHOSEN AS- THE VENDOR TO OPEN THIS LAB IF I'M IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY YES. YES THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY I MEAN YOU KNOW. THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT- ACCOUNTABILITY WE KEEP I AND THIS IS NOT DIRECTED AT YOU- BUT JUST IN GENERAL- THE WHOLE AT LAST. WHAT IS IT ALMOST TWO AND A HALF HOURS ALMOST THREE HOURS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- EQUITY NO WE'VE BEEN THROWING THOSE WORDS AROUND- VERY LOOSELY. AND NOW THAT I'M ASKING QUESTIONS WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE INFORMATION AS TO WHY THINGS WERE DONE SO HOW CAN WE ENSURE. EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND- IF WE CAN'T ANSWER KIND OF IN MY OPINION THE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU DON'T THROUGH THIS PROCESS- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS ARE BEING BOMBARDED AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'RE BEING BOMBARDED AND WE HAVE WAY LESS INFORMATION THAN YOU DO. AND SO IT'S FRUSTRATING- THAT YOU KNOW WE ALSO USE TERMS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO BETTER. THAT IS NOT- THAT DOESN'T HELP ME AND IT DOESN'T HELP I BELIEVE AND I WON'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES BUT IT DOESN'T HELP ANY OF US TO GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS. AND TELL THEM THEY'RE TRYING TO DO BETTER THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW A DATE OR TIME OR ANY KIND OF ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE FIXED- SOMEWHERE ANOTHER AND SO- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REQUEST THAT INFORMATION AND I'LL LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUES. BITE I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AGAIN FOR OVER TWO AND A HALF HOURS AND WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY SUBSTANTIATE YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIAL INFORMATION IT'S BEEN ALL KIND OF- AGAIN BIG WORDS THROWN AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY EQUITY. AND WE WANT TO DO BETTER WE ALL WANT TO DO BETTER BUT HOW. DO WE ACTUALLY GET INFORMATION THAT IS GOING TO VALUABLE FOR US BE ABLE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS. MY STAFF AND I CAN. PROBABLY ASSUME THAT ALL OF THE- MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE THEIR STAFFS ARE GETTING BOMBARDED WITH QUESTIONS THAT THEY CAN ANSWER AND OUR PUBLIC DOESN'T ACCEPT WE WANT TO DO BETTER. THEY WANT ANSWERS AND THEY WANT. A REAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO AGAIN IT'S MORE OF A GENERAL COMMENT RIGHT NOW BUT I DO NEED HELP AS TO HOW WE CAN GET ACTUAL INFORMATION INSTEAD OF. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO BETTER. I WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE EQUITY WERE TRYING TO- INVESTIGATE YOU KNOW INVESTIGATE THE VIOLENCE THE ALLEGATIONS YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES OUT IN THE NEWS WE ARE THE FACES AND WE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE RESPONDING TO. TO THE PUBLIC AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR US BACK THERE WERE FORTUNATELY FOR US THAT'S WHAT WE SIGNED UP FOR HOWEVER WHEN I'VE COME HERE AND TRYING TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS I CAN'T GO BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND SAY. WELL I ASKED THEM THEY TOLD ME YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO BETTER THAT IS NOT A GOOD ANSWER STILL SOMEHOW IF. IF WE CAN ALL COME UP WITH. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW BENCHMARKS OR- YOU KNOW- TIME FRAMES AS TO WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO WILL GET THAT TO YOU AT SOME POINT- I IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AGAIN FOR US TO DO OUR JOBS. AND IF WE'RE LOOKING TO YOU TO GIVE US THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT WE GET IS YOU KNOW WILL EVENTUALLY GET IT TO SELL. AGAIN AT THEIR QUESTIONS THEIR ACTUAL QUESTIONS AND I WILL SUBMIT. THAT REQUEST OF THE FIRST REQUEST IN WRITING BUT I THINK YOU KNOW FOR THE REST OF THE MEETING IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT- WE'RE GONNA BE MEETING ON A REGULAR BASIS IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN ASK THAT QUESTION SO THAT I CAN GET. ACTUAL ANSWERS AS OPPOSED. TO YOU KNOW I'LL GET BACK TO YOU AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. YES FIRST I'D LIKE TO SEE A IS OUR MADERA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR STILL WITH US IT'S ONE TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS. MISS BOSS. I'M STILL HERE GOOD GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO I HAD HEARD FROM ANOTHER COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR THAT THAT THEY'VE HAD TO YOU GUYS HAVE HAD TO INTERFACE WITH EIGHT SEVEN EIGHT NINE DIFFERENT DATA SYSTEMS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IS THAT. IS THAT ACCURATE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. THERE ARE SEVERAL DATA SYSTEMS I CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER- BUT THERE IS A- KIND OF A- FRACTURED WAIT IN CALIFORNIA AND WHICH WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH- THE MAGNITUDE OF COALBED. AND I SUSPECT IT'S BECAUSE THERE WASN'T AN INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH THIS KIND OF EVENT AND SO WE'VE- AND THE STATE HAVE USED SYSTEMS THAT WERE AVAILABLE- TO BE ABLE TO REPURPOSE TEM OR EXPAND A LOT ALONG THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE COBIT. SO- WELL THAT'S AND THAT'S THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I WHAT I WHAT I WAS TOLD TO SO APPRECIATE THAT SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS THE COUNTIES WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TO WHAT IS YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IS GOING TO BE DOING FOR YOU AS A COUNTY AND WILL THAT REQUIRE YOU ENCOUNTERING ADDITIONAL DATA RICH DISTRICT DISTANCE NEW KINDS OF DATA REPORTING SYSTEMS AS ON TOP OF THE- OTHER SYSTEMS YOU ALREADY HAVE. SO THE DIGITAL DATA SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE HAD TO EMPLOY THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE REALLY TO LINK TOGETHER OR AUGMENT. THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO US TO DATE. I'M SO FOR INSTANCE OUR APPOINTMENT- SYSTEM. WE HAVE TO KIND OF. PUT SURVEYS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO ACTUALLY COLLECT THE COMPLETE DATA THAT WE NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. LIKE OCCUPATION FOR INSTANCE WAS A COLLECTED IN THE SYSTEM THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO US AT FIRST. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MY TURN WHICH IS REPLACING NODDED AND ROLLING OUT STATEWIDE WILL ADDRESS THOSE THINGS BUT IT NEEDED TO BE BUILT. AND ADAPTED TO LOCAL HEALTH NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. WHAT WE HAVE. HEARD FROM WITH REGARDS TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. IS THAT- THEY ARE REALLY AN OPERATIONS MACHINE. THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THE ISSUES OF DATA AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE- ALLOCATIONS RUN SMOOTHLY. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE WITH REGARDS TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY ARE BEING NEGOTIATED IN THE CONTRACT- BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO MANAGE THE ALLOCATIONS THAT COME INTO THE STATE BASED ON INFORMATION THAT THAT'S C. PAGE HAS AS WELL AS BEING INFORMED BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND. AND THEN DISTRIBUTING DIRECTLY OUT TO THOSE PROVIDERS SO THEN LOCAL DEPARTMENTS WILL NOT BE MIDDLEMAN IN TERMS OF VACCINE ALLOCATION LOCALLY BUT MORE IN AN ADVISER ROLE. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT FROM A LOCAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK INTO THOSE SPECIFIC PROVIDERS THAT MAY NOT HAVE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY AT FIRST BUT CAN TARGET VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU- AND THAT AND THIS IS A QUESTION I GUESS FOR. THIS WEEK WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE CONTRACT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONTRACT WE DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT THE CONTRACTS GOING TO COST. SO I. I GUESS IT FROM SOMEONE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH MAYBE CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM DIRECTOR- AND THAT IS- NOPE. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE IN THE EARLIER CONVERSATION THAT THAT A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OR GOING TO BE- NOW THE ROLE OF THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. AND SO LIKE I SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT CONTRACT WE DON'T KNOW THE SIZE OF THE CONTRACT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW ALL OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES- HOW'S THAT AFFECT THE BUDGET. THAT'S BEFORE US. HOW DO WE DON'T NOT WE WON'T REALLY KNOW SO. THEN WHEN WILL WE KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE BUDGET THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT OUT THERE- BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BEING SHIFTED TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. THAN DO THEY RIP I THINK ARE YOU AT THE PUMP DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH LIKE THE MIDDLE MAN OR WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM FOR THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. IT JUST FEELS LIKE A BIG BLACK BOX RIGHT NOW. ANYONE UP DIRECTOR PUBLIC HEALTH SOME. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ASKING A VERY A VERY GOOD QUESTION- I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM- I CAN EXPLAIN TO CONCEPTUALLY WHY WE THINK THAT THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT- THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF. THE MONEY. SO WE DON'T SO DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA AFFECT YOUR BUDGET. I GUESS I'M I GUESS I'M KIND OF WONDERING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE RIGHT NOW. WE EXPECT FRANKLY BECAUSE I DO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THE FULL PICTURE. OF WHAT YOUR BUDGET'S GOING TO BE A LIE- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS IS HOW MUCH OF THIS NEW THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WHERE THAT MONEY'S COMING FROM ISN'T COMING OUT YOUR BUDGET IS A COMING OUT OF SOMEWHERE ELSE. IF YOU'RE OFFLOADING WORK TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR THAT CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON YOUR ON YOUR BUDGET THIS YEAR. SO AT SOME POINT I GUESS REALLY THE POINT OF MY QUESTIONS IS AT WHAT POINT ARE WE GOING TO REALLY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT. NEW MEMBERS AND I AM JACK'S WALL FROM GOVERNOR FINANCE- SPEAKING ABOUT THE- THE DEPARTMENT STRICTER CONTRACT IN SORT OF THE ON GOING RESPONSE BROADLY- THESE ARE COSTS THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE- COSTS ARE NOT NEW TO THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WE'VE HAD TO RIDE IN. A NUMBER OF- HELLO REQUEST SECTION THREE SIX REQUEST TO DEAL WITH THESE SORTS OF EXPENDITURES IN THE PAST WHETHER THAT WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS THEN BACK. TO BITE VENTILATORS ARE OR WRAPPED YOU KNOW WHAT THE OKAY STATE SENATE STAFF SURGEONS OR OR WHATEVER- YOU KNOW AS AS WE SORT OF. MOVED TOWARDS TO FINALIZING THE- THIRD PARTY. AGREEMENTS WE WILL BE ABLE TO- JEFF MORE DETAIL- TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND AS WE SORT OF CREATED A UNIVERSE OF FIVE I THINK. THE NECESSARY TO REQUEST AFTER. SO I GUESS WHAT I'M LOKING FOR IS AT SOME POINT WILL WE GET SORT OF A OKAY THERE'S A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR HERE'S PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET HERE'S HOW THEY INTERACT OR DON'T INTERACT- SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF ALL OF THIS RELATED TO THE PUBLIC HELP BUDGET. THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO. WE WILL GET THAT INFORMATION AT SOME POINT. YES. YEAH I WHETHER YOU WILL GET THAT INFORMATION AT SOME POINT- YEAH WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF NAY L. A. R. TO PROVIDE. OUR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS FUNDING. REQUESTS AND SORT OF ALLOCATIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED. TO DPH AND A NUMBER OF OTHER- THE DEPARTMENTS OF THE STATE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- THIS THIS- THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS- IS AN ON GOING PROJECT THAT THAT WILL BE IT FURTHER COMMUNICATION- WITH YOUR STAFF ON AS WE- AS WE MOVE. FURTHER THROUGH THIS KIND OF RESPONSE PROCESS. BUT I GUESS MY OVERARCHING POINT OF THAT IS IT FOR PAIN ONE PERSON ONE GROUP TO DO IT AND ANOTHER GROUP HAS BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS. I DON'T SEE IS PAIN TWICE. I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THE. SO WE UNDERSTAND CLASS OR WHEN- THAT IS A VERY REASONABLE CONCERN AND- SOMETHING WILL BE TAKE A LOOK AT. AND SO AT WHAT YOU CAN DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN WILL WHEN THE CONTRACT AND ALL THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN WILL BE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. WHAT IT WOULD HELP IF I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I'M AFRAID. OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SINCE WE DO HAVE. MORE LET'S LOOK AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BACK. AND TALK ABOUT THIS THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A COUPLE MORE DAYS LEFT OF THIS- CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS IS THAT CORRECT. S. R. AT THIS I'M NOT BOTH THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THIRD PARTY STRAIGHTER CANNOT SPEAK CONFIDENTLY TO THE STATE OF THOSE TO GO SHE ASIANS. OKAY IF I COULD GET THE- THE. MADERA MODESTO HEALTH DIRECTOR MADERA HELP DIRECTOR PLEASE. SO MADAM DIRECTOR AS AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH- GETTING LOGGED ON MY QUESTION FOR YOU THAT YOUR LEVEL SINCE THIS CONTRACT ISN'T WRITTEN YET. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN THAT CONTRACT AND WHY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE- AND OTHER LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALSO COMMUNICATED. ORTON'S OF WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN DETERMINING WHICH PROVIDERS ARE A PART OF THE NETWORK. AND ALSO MONITORING AT THE DATA WITH REGARDS TO THE PROVIDERS- MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT REMOVING IMPORTANT PROVIDERS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I'M FROM THE NETWORK SIMPLY DUE TO EFFICIENCY. I'M BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW AT THE GROUND LEVEL IS THAT. WONDERFUL POPULATIONS HEALTH LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHER ACCESS ISSUES- FOR INSTANCE THE DISABLED POPULATION AND BEING ABLE TO GET A VACCINATION SITE SO IT'S IF YOU HAVE A PROVIDER THAT SPECIFICALLY WORKING WITH THOSE POPULATIONS THE PACE OF VACCINATION IS GOING TO BE SLOWER. SO WHAT WE ULTIMATELY WANT TO SEE IS THAT THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IS WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE GROUND LEVEL IN COUNTIES WITH REGARDS TO PROVIDERS AND WHO DOES IMPORTANT PROVIDERS. ARE AS A PART OF THE NETWORK. SO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE USING EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS TO GET OUT TO YOU- DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS THE USE OF SUCH AS DISABLED OR AG WORKERS. OR OR OTHERS. THAT'S CORRECT AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING- ADEQUATE TRAINING WITH REGARDS TO YOU- HOW TO INPUT THE DATA AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACCURATE CONSISTENT AT THE ENTRY DOESN'T HAVE ERRORS BECAUSE- YOU'VE GOT AT. A SMALL CBO ON THE GROUNDS THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA EXPERTISE SO ADEQUATE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND. SO ENSURING THAT THE- WHATEVER SOFTWARE THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH IS VERY USER FRIENDLY IN TRAINING GOES ALONG WITH THAT. CORRECT. SO TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE I MEAN WE KNOW THEY'VE HAD DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND I THINK THE- A. T. USED LORD OF THE RINGS HERE BUT IT'S KIND OF- ONE ONE PROGRAM TO RULE THEM ALL- WHAT DOES THAT I MEAN WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. TO YOU. I MEAN IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUR WISHLIST YOU IN AND I AND I TALKED TO MY- MY PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR TO IN IN ALL THREE OF THEM. BUT WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FROM YOU KNOW YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF YOU COULD SAY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE. A YOUR TO TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW. WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. IT WOULD INCLUDE THOSE PROVIDERS THAT ARE NEEDED TO TRULY OUTRAGE TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION WITHIN AN EIGHT COUNTY AREA. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A DATA SYSTEM THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE REMOTELY SO PROBABLY CLOUD BASED. THE ABILITY TO INPUT DATA REAL TIME THE ABILITY TO CALL REPORTS REAL TIME TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THOSE I'M DATA POINTS ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THOSE OUT TO OUR LOCAL CAN- COMMUNITIES AND THE MEDIA ARE BECAUSE WHERE ELSE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE JUST CAN'T. ANSWER AT THIS POINT. AND WITH THE FLEXIBILITY OF THOSE SYSTEMS I'M TO BE ABLE TO PLAN AND MINISTER PODS ON THE GROUND. OUR COUNTIES ARE SO DIVERSE. AND BEING ABLE TO SCHEDULE CLINICS THE WAY WE NEED TO. HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE USING THE SAME INPUT SYSTEM. BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THIS GROUP VERSUS BACK GROUP TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW SLOTS FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAD BEEN PRIORITIZING ONLY SEVENTY FIVE IN UP IN MADERA COUNTY DUE TO- COMPUTER. ISSUES CONNECTIVITY- AND JUST THEIR UNFAMILIARITY WITH ONLINE REGISTRATION PROCESSES. I'M AND WE OPENED UP TO AGE SIXTY FIVE AN UP AND ALMOST INSTANTLY WE HAD A POPULATION THAT WERE CALLING AND CALLING BECAUSE THEY JUST COULDN'T GET REGISTERED FAST ENOUGH. SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SEPARATE CLINICS JUST SERVE VERY VOCAL POPULATIONS WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS. WHILE WE'RE A PART OF THIS STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT SERVES EVERYONE. THANK YOU I HOPE THEIR LISTENING. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES IF I CAN FOR THE BREADTH OF QUESTIONS I THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE INFORMATIVE AND IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS. I WILL ADD FIVE QUESTIONS IF I CAN BUT FIRST I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM DR PAM AS WELL AS- SUSAN FINALE. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND NEED FOR GOOD DATA AND IT SYSTEMS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW TRANSPARENCY LEADS TO A BETTER PROCESS ARE IMPORTANT GOALS FOR US TO HAVE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DATA AND TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SINCE I FRAMED IT AND STARTED THE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT I REALLY DO WANT TO ASK DR ERIC ON DOCTOR PAN IF I CAN'T. ABOUT THE DATA ON OUR CODE NINETEEN VACCINES RIGHT NOW. ARE THEY GOING TO THE POOR AND TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE ARE THEY GOING TO WEALTHY AND THE PRIVILEGED. ALTHOUGH STARTED AND DOCTOR DOCTOR AND CAN ADD. YOU'RE ASKING A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS REALLY CRITICAL WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO PASS DATA POSSIBLE BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS DATA WE WILL NOT HAVE VISIBILITY INTO WHO'S BEING VACCINATED. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY WE'RE THAT FAR WITH THE PROVIDERS. AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE'RE REALLY GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE QUALITY OF THE DATA WITH THE WITH SOMEBODY TO GET VACCINATED. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE ENTERED THAT THAT BE HAVE TURNED TO THE WAY IT GOES INTO REGISTRY. WHETHER YOU'RE BEING VACCINATED AT A HEALTH FUND. AT A PHARMACY IN THE COMMUNITY PHOTOMASKS ACTIVATIONS- MEGAFIGHT. NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE GETTING ACTUALLY- ARE YOU BEGINNING BACKED INTO THE HOME OR IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. THAT HAVE TO COME INTO IT IT HAS THE DATA HAVE TO BE ANSWERED. SO WE CAN THEN KNOW EXACTLY WHO GOT VACCINATED WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S OF CODE. AND HOPEFULLY SOMETIME TODAY IS INCOMPLETE IN TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY SO THAT WE CAN REALLY CHARACTERIZED. WHO'S GETTING VACCINATED. EMAIL OR CALL THE DATA IT. WE'RE WORKING ON IT FOR THE CALL OF THE DATA RALPH SHIPPED FROM. PHASE ONE PHASE ONE IN. THEY WERE NOW BEGINNING PHASE ONE B. OR THE DATA IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY CRITICAL. AND WE ARE WORKING ON IN EQUITY PLANS SO THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING OUR EQUITY GOALS IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT THERE YET AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE DATA IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ALL OF US INCLUDING THAT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE EQUITY GOALS WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. COMING FROM THE VALLEY WE YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE I KEEP HEARING THE CONVERSATION TODAY AND IT REMINDS ME OF THE FOG THAT WE HAVE IN THE VALLEY IT REMINDS ME THAT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US TO SEE CLEARLY AND- I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOG THE REASON WHY WE HAD TO PIVOT IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND DATA THE REASON WHY THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDED TO MOVE TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. I WILL I WILL GIVE YOU SERVE MY- MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT AS I THOUGHT IN THE CHALLENGES I COME. BY WITH THE HELP OF BY WITH THE HELP OF THEIR FOOD GO FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS. AND SO I'M I'M I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU HI WE'RE PROBABLY FROM A FROM A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AND THEN WHATEVER THE SEARCH HERE TO THIS COUNTRY FROM FRO THE- SHOP OWNER OF HER FROM COMING TO THE STATE. THIS MACRO THIS VACCINATION. PROGRAM THEY WERE GONNA TRY TO CHIU. AT THE STATE IS MATH OF IT IS MATH. AT ALL OF ALL OF US HAVE COMPLEMENTARY ROLES EVER GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. ALL OF US HAVE TO DO WELL WALDRON REALLY ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS. AND WE NEED TO BRING THOSE STRENGTHS TO THE TABLE SO THAT WE CAN GET AS MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH CHARLES. IS REALLY HAVE TERM EXPERTISE AGAIN REACHING POPULATIONS. THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO REACH AND REACHING HOMELESS. WELL WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES IN REACHING IMMIGRANTS UNDOCUMENTED AND HANDED OUT WORKING WORKING IN CONGREGATE SITES ACTUALLY PUBLICADOS THE TRIM TREMENDOUS THE ROLE IN PARTNERING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO GET PEOPLE BACK WITH TO GET PEOPLE VACCINATED. WELL WE NEED A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO SCALE UP AND READ IT WE REALLY WANT TO GET HELP IF WE WILL IF WE WANT TO REACH. HERD IMMUNITY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SCALE UP TREMENDOUSLY FOR ME WE HAVE TO IT'S ALMOST LIKE BUILDING A FREE WARY. OF LIKE WE'RE ADDING LANES TO A FREEWAY IT IS GOING TO COULD OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OUR PHARMACY NETWORK OUR CLINIC NETWORK THE INCLUDING GOT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER THAT ARE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE MEGA FIGHTS AND AS WELL AS- FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE HOMEBOUND. THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE OR WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO VACCINATE EVERYBODY HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE. OKAY MINISTRY TO THIS OF THEIR REALLY BROUGH IT UP THERE REALLY AT MANTA. THAT WORKS. THERE REALLY AND- PAPER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES. AND KNOWING HOW TO HOLD HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. IN CLINICAL PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE TO MEETING TO MEETING OUR TARGETS OF THE OF THE VACCINATION. AND THEY THEY THEY HAVE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF CONTRACTING HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND IT IT WILL IT WILL NOT GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT OUR EQUITY GOALS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE VACCINATING PEOPLE THE MOST IMPACTED AREAS POLITICALLY THE COMBINATION. OF ALL OF THOSE SO PUBLIC TROUBLES GOING TO CONTINUE TO PLAY A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE AS AS- EVER HELP OFTEN THROUGH PROVIDE YOUR COUNTY WITH TWENTY NOW WE REALLY DO NEED THEM. BECAUSE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY. WHO THE COMMUNITY WE NEED TO REACH. NOW- YOU WILL A LOCAL PUB HELD OFF AND IT WAS NOT MISTER FOSTER JUST WANNA BE CLEAR THAT. WHO WHEN I WAS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT DATA JUST THIS PAST WEEK TOLD ME THAT THEY'RE FLYING BLIND HIS WORDS NOT MINE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THEM ON A FOGGY DEW IN THE VALLEY YOU DON'T FLY WHEN YOU'RE BLIND. AND I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. DOING ALL WE CAN TO. MEASURE THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE IMPROVE UPON IT. AND SO I. BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING CLEARLY FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS. REALLY WANTING THAT DATA SO WE CAN HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY WE ALL ARE- ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AND- I BELIEVE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS QUITE HELPFUL TO THEM. I WANT TO MOVE ON THOUGH IF I COULD BECAUSE DOCTOR ARE GONE YOU SAID SOMETHING TODAY THAT IS A NEW DATA POINTS SOMETHING THAT- HAS CHANGED SINCE THE LAST TIME WE'VE SPOKEN. AND THAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE FOR ALLOCATION AND I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE IT BECAUSE I THINK YOU. REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE FOURTH QUESTION THAT I ASKED ABOUT WHERE. WHERE ARE WE GOING FROM HERE. AND FOR CHANGING THAT PERCENT OF ALLOCATION TO BOTH REPRESENT POVERTY AS WELL AS RACE AND ETHNICITY. IT SEEMS AS IF WE WILL GET TO TOWARDS EQUITY FASTER AND WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE WAY OR IF YOU COULD. YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD- VERY GOOD QUESTION AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH WITH A CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL DR- NADINE BURKE HARRIS ON THIS ISSUE WHERE SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING TIME- DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK ON HOW WE WOULD GIVE VACCINES TO CHEAT THE CHIEF EQUITY GOALS- PART OF. PART OF IT IS THAT WE NEED WE NEED WE NEED TO SORT OF EITHER THE QUALITY AND THEN THERES EQUITY WE DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VACCINES ARE DISTRIBUTED FOR. INDUSTRY BUT IN A WAY THAT ARE REACHES. THE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND- THAT WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL MELTED OR BETTER. ALLOCATED TO AREAS THAT ARE MORE DISTANT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE USING THE- HEALTHY PLACES INDEX. SHOWED UP AREAS THAT ARE MOST THAT ARE MOST ANTI HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY IT BECAUSE- COVERED PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO THE LOW. LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO GET ADDITIONAL VACCINE ALLOCATED TO AREAS. AND THAT MEANS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HELPING PLACES INDEX YOU'LL SEE THAT. THE RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA ARE GONNA BE BETTER REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF GETTING. GETTING THE VACCINE SUPPLY. THE OTHER THING THAT. WE'RE HEARING FROM FOLKS ON THE GROUND. THANK ARE ACTUALLY DON'T APPEAR SOME OF THE DATA. UP SOME OF THE POPULAR HEALTHY SAID THREE GREEN THINGS LIKE A P. I. SO I'M HERE FROM LOW HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THEY HAVE FOR. SHE ACT A RIGHT NOW I JUST OF YEAR OR COME INTO THE COUNTY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO VACCINATE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER AND UNDOCUMENTED. ALSO THERE IT SO WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES BESIDES THE ONES THAT ARE. DIVERSE SORT OF THE BENEFIT OF OBVIOUS JUST FROM WHAT THE TYPICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND THE ONLY WAY THEY WERE GOING TO REACH THOSE POPULATIONS OF THE WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES BECAUSE EVERY COUNTY IT'S GONNA IT'S GONNA DIFFERENT EVERY COUNTY. AND SO THAT BOOTS ON THE GROUND IS REALLY GOING TO HELP US MEET THE BEATLES. MEET THOSE GOALS. GOOD THING I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IS. SURE LEANING BACK ARE TO COME ON ON ON THERE ARE BECOME AVAIL FOR. THEY'RE GONNA BE MY EASIER FOR US TO- DISTRIBUTE ACROSS THE STATE. TO THE JOHNSON AND JOHNSON VACCINE WITHOUT BECAUSE AVAILABLE THAT THE ONE SHOP VACCINE AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER OTHER VACCINES HAVE LOWER REFRIGERATION REQUIREMENTS. SO WE ANTICIPATE WE WANT TO BE IN THE POSITION OF THE VACCINE OF THE PIE INCREASES WE NEED A MAP OF THE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT CAN REALLY DELIVER. VACCINES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. SPEAKING AS ONE OF THOSE PROVIDERS WHO TOMORROW WILL BE GOING OUT TO ORANGE GROVE TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINES TORE FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES I'M- HAPPY TO TAKE THE CHALLENGE PERSONALLY AND KNOW THAT- THERE ARE THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO IS A STATE. BUT REALLY WANTED TO DIG IN JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IF I COULD. I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THERE REALLY WAS A DISCREPANCY IN TERMS OF COUNTIES WITH DOSES ADMINISTERED. THEY'VE BEEN ALLOTTED A CERTAIN NUMBER. BUT WE HAVE DISCREPANCIES AS WIDE AS 50% AND 92% THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO US THIS WEEK. AND SO MY- QUESTION FOR YOU IS. HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO. BE USING OUR VACCINES- AS EFFECTIVELY AS WE CAN WHAT DIRECTION ARE YOU PROVIDING TO THEM TO. ENCOURAGE AND INCENTIVIZE THAT. SO WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DIRECTORS TO- THE PURPOSE OF THE PROVIDERS PRIMARILY TO THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND WE WERE IN CURRENT WORK WERE ENCOURAGING THEM WE'RE ENCOURAGING THEM TO NOT TO NOT TO HOLD ON TO VACCINES VERY LONG. WE WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO GET THE VACCINE IN IN IN IN TO- THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DIRECTIONS- AND WHAT AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HAS REALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED CLOSING THE DATA GAP THAT WE HAD BECAUSE WE REALIZED. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE THE SOURCE OF THE TRUTH FOR DATA IS THAT. SOMEBODY'S WITH SOMEBODY INTERACTION IT IS. WE MAY NOT KNOW THAT THAT PERSON WAS VACCINATED UNTIL THAT GETS ENTERED INTO OUR REGISTRY. HOW IT GETS INTO OUR REGISTRY DEFERRED IF YOU HAVE AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THAT'S WHAT THAT THAT ALREADY COMMUNICATE FOR REGISTRY WE KNOW ABOUT IT. IT WAS ON A PAPER SYSTEM ANY ATTRIBUTES WE KNOW ABOUT IT OR DO YOU WANT TO BE APPROVED- MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM. AND INDUCTOR COMMUNICATE TO OUR REGISTRY WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND IT'S TAKEN US A WHILE TO SORT OF REALLY SORT OUT WHY INFORMATION WASN'T GETTING INTO OUR SYSTEMS IN SOME CASES IT WAS NEVER ENTERED IT WAS ENTERED AT YOUR IT WAS ENTERED IN LATE. WE WORKED WITH SOME PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE PILES OF PEOPLE THEY READ THE VACCINATED ADVANCE PAPERS WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO HELP THEM ANSWER ANSWER THAT THAT INFORMATION. AND SO WE'RE LEARNING TO THE PROBLEMS OF HOW TO MAKE A HOW TO HOW TO MAKE THAT MORE. EFFICIENT I'M NOT SURE IF I ANSWERED YOUR WHOLE QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN IF YOU CAN JUST REMIND. ME IF I WANT TO SHARE ANSWERED ALL. THE COUNTIES ARE- CHIU. TO HOLD A SECOND DOSE- YEAH WOULD BE A DEFINITE BUT BETTER GOOD CORD MANY OTHER CHALLENGE THAT THE WAY THIS GOVERNMENT START THE PROGRAM. THIS TORRENT OF THE PROBE WILL SAID YOUR DOES YOU'VE- WANNA HOLD BACK FROM SECOND DAY IT AND WILL WE WILL SHIP OUT LATE TO YOU SO THAT. IF I THAT. YOU HAVE ALL YOU HAVE A SHOULD OF. CAPTION DESIGNATE OF THIS DOES THAT MISSION OF THE OF THE NATIVE AS OF THE FIRST. BUT IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME. BACK THERE IS NO DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S NO DIFFERENT THAT. SO YOU CAN ALSO WON'T THAT HAPPENS ESPECIALLY MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BECOME VACCINATED YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO MAY RECEIVE THEIR FIRST DOSE AT ONE LOCATION BUT LATER ON REQUIRE MADE ME RECEIVE HER DAUGHTER THE OTHER LOCATION BECAUSE IT'S MORE CONVENIENT OR THEY'VE MOVED OR THAT'S JUST WHAT THE VERY AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND SO THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THIS IDEA OF SOMETHING BEING. THE FIRST OF HER SECOND DOES. WE'RE ASKING PROVIDERS TO TREAT LIKE ANY OTHER. THAT HAVE MULTIPLE. APPLE HAS VACCINE APPETITE AB T. SHOCK AND YOU START SERIES YOU COULD YOUR AFTER IT RENEWS GET YOUR SECOND SHOT. AS A ROUTING NEED TO REALLY THINK OF THEM DOLLARS FIRST OF THE SECOND DOES IT BUT IT DOESN'T IT DOES AND YOUR READERS STARTING THE SERIES OR YOU'RE COMPLETING A SERIES. OR DOING AFTER REALLY COMES DOWN TO THAT IT'S A. IT BECOMES AN EXERCISE IN. BOB WE IS REALLY INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. AND SCHEDULING PERSONS TO EITHER COME INTO STARTERS VERY AND TO COMPLETE THEIR SERIES. AND SO THAT'S PART OF THAT FOR THE COMMUNICATION PLAN THAT WOULD THAT WERE USING I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BUT- THAT'S A STEP SHORT VERSION. NO THAT'LL PRETTY GOOD I. DO WANT TO ASK I WAS INTENDING TO ASK THIS BUT THE GOVERNOR HAS FREQUENTLY SAID THAT THE STATE HAS NO FREEZERS WE HAVE NO STORAGE I WANTED TO CONFIRM WITH YOU. THAT THE MANUFACTURERS DELIVERED THE VACCINES DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTIES OR PROVIDERS CARE AND SO THE STATE IS NOT HOLDING ANY ACCIDENTS BACK ANY VACCINES THAT ARE NOT. MINISTER ARE CURRENTLY BY A POLICY CHOICE. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IS THAT CORRECT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DIRECTLY PROVIDERS- SO YEAH THAT THE STATE OF THE STATE WE HAVE NO VACCINES. THEY GO THEY GO THEY GO THE ROUTE THEY GO OUT TO PROVE THAT THE PROVIDERS. YEAH THE PROVIDERS ARE SELECTED IN CONSULTATION WITH A- HOW DO YOU LOCAL HOW JURISDICTIONS. FUNNELED TO QUESTIONS- WE TALK A FAIR AMOUNT ABOUT MORTALITY WOULD WE DON'T TALK ABOUT MORBIDITY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. WHAT THE STATE IS PLANNING TO DO THE STUDY. AND UNDERSTAND THE AFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN ON LONG HAULERS ON. PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. ARE WE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ANY RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS. TO HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THIS MORBIDITY AND- IF NOT- WOULD LIKE TO SAY. UP WITH A PLAN THAT. WILL ALLOW US TO DO THIS EFFECTIVE RESEARCH. YEAH THERE THERE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH- HAPPENING- AND I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE RESURS OF HAPPENING AT AT THE UC SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE UP FOR I HAD IT. NOT BEEN AFFILIATION- HAVE SO IT THIS IS THE TRUTH WE'VE UNIVERSITY STANFORD BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THE UC SYSTEM WORKING CLOSELY WITH. LOTS OF LOCAL ALSO WITH THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON CONDUCTING RESEARCH WE DO HAVE ONE OF OUR BRANCHES THAT- DESIGNING A LONGITUDINAL STUDY BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE NEED TO LEARN A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT MORE. AND SO WE HAVE OUR TESTING SYSTEM THAT IDENTIFIES PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE OPEN FOR POSITIVE. AND THEN- VACCINATION REGISTRIES GOING TO BE ANOTHER SORT OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO ABANDON VACCINATED WHO MAY BECOME INFECTED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND THEN VACCINATED AND THEN WE HAVE BEING INTRODUCED INTO ALL OF THESE ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO HELP. TO ANSWER IMPORTANT. RESEARCH QUESTIONS INTO THE FUTURE. I SIMPLY. THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO BUDGET. FROM THIS. TO COME THIS RESEARCH. AND IF THERE IS A WILLINGNESS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AYE I KNOW OF AN OFFICE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO. HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD. FINAL QUESTION IF I COULD IS- ON THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. HI I'M TRYING TO. AND FOLLOWING UP WITH WHERE THE DOCTOR WOULD WAS ASKING THE QUESTION. MANY OF US ARE TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING IF THAT'S A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT. BECAUSE IF IT'S A SIMPLE IF YOU'RE TELLING US IT'S A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT. WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT CERTAIN RESULTS AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO TELL US THAT YOU WILL BE NEEDING MORE RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE THIS VACCINE. THAT'S ALSO A CONVERSATION I BELIEVE ME AS THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU- YOUR THOUGHTS ON- THE SUFFICIENCY OF THAT ALLOCATION. YEAH I'M NOT LET ME LET ME BRING TO THE SHE WANTED TO WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THAT SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF THAT BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION BUT IT'S THE ABILITY TO USE THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. THAT WE GOT IN THE L. C. GRANT FROM CDC AS WELL AND THAT MONEY COVERS NOT ONLY VACCINE SUPPORT BUT ALSO CASTING AND CONTACT TRACING AND DATA ANALYTICS AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S NOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND YOU. WILL BE PUTTING TOGETHER WORK PLANS AND WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY ACROSS THE TWO SOURCES OF FUNDING. AND WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN THOSE GAPS MAY NOT OCCUR IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS. BUT THEY MAY CALL MATT DEPENDING ON. WE NEED TRANSIT. TO PAY ON THE ROLE OF THE TVA VERSUS THE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS SO. I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME UNKNOWNS BUT I THINK THIS IS. PROVIDING THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE NEED IMMEDIATELY AND WILL KEEP TABS ON THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE FOR O'CLOCK BUT WE LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU AND- WITH THAT I REALLY DO WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE PANEL THREE. AND WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO PANEL FOR. ON STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH. WE HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS WE HAVE DIRECTOR BOSS MISS AUSSIE. MISS BLOOMBERG AND MR OF THE BONA WE CAN GO IN THAT ORDER PLEASE PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN SHARE AND MEMBERS CEREBUS FROM MADERA COUNTY ON BEHALF OF GEAC. I WANT TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT BUDGET BUDGET REQUESTS THAT WERE PERFORMED BY JACK IN OUR PARTNER STARTING WITH THE REQUEST FOR ONE POINT TWO BILLION FOR COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO SUPPORT CONTINUED CONTACT TRACING DISEASE INVESTIGATION. TESTING AS WELL AS VACCINE ADMINISTRATION COSTS SUCH AS SITE COST SECURITY AND STAFF. WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO MEET THIS NEED AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. WE WOULD NOTE THAT FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THESE FUNDS TO BE EX BENDED OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD BUT BECAUSE OF THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL LIKELY EXPAND. THESE FUNDS VERY QUICKLY. WAIT ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK THE LEGISLATOR TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. LEGISLATURE TRIED TO ENTER MILLION AND ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS THE EROSION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE. CALIFORNIA CAN'T WAIT TO REACT TO THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. INSTEAD WE NEED TO LEVERAGE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGHOUT COVER NINETEEN AND ENSURE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED NOW. OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NEED TO INCREASE CRITICAL STAFFING INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO EPIDEMIOLOGISTS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INVESTIGATORS HEALTH EDUCATORS DATA ARCHITECTS AND SYSTEMS ANALYSTS PUBLIC HEALTH LAB MICROBIOLOGIST AND LAB TECHS. AND EQUITY OFFICERS ADDITIONAL STAFF TO SUPPORT EQUITY WORK. PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE CONVERSATION WORK AROUND EQUITY FOR A LONG TIME. INVESTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE IT MEANS WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK TO ADDRESS SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LAID BARE BY COPING NINETEEN. AND THOSE SAME STAFFER BROWN TO A AND- WELL TRAINED EX. AND CAN. AND IT'S TO VOTE TO. WHEN THEIR EFFORTS TO BE DIVERTED TO A PUBLIC CRISIS SUCH AS CARBONITE AND FUTURE. LASTLY WE ASK FOR YOUR- OF THREE POINT FOR ME. TO SUPPORT AND EVALUATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORK AND IN. TO HELP INFORM WHAT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD BE. AND HOW TO ENSURE A QUALIFIED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE IS IN PLACE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST AND AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU MISS OFTEN. MISTER CHAIR AND REMEMBERS MY NAME SHOULD BE CROSSING AND I AM AN STI YOU PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE BASED ON THE Y. AXIS FULL BOOK AREA OF LOS ANGELES IN ADDITION TO SERVING AS A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE FOR THE COUNTY I ALSO WORK AS PART OF A COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. I'M HERE TODAY TWO YEARS AFTER MAKING A SIMILAR APPEAL IN THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC TAX TO STATE TO SUPPORT OUR CORE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORK FORCE I FINALLY INVESTING TWO HUNDRED MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. HAVE BEEN RAVAGED BY COLBERT NINETEEN MORE DEVASTATING LEVELS. THAN WOULD HAVE OCCURRED HAD LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PROFICIENTLY STAFFED AND RESOURCE TO BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC. I WORK WITH A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTIGATORS. ELLIS EDUCATORS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS LAP SCIENTISTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHAT QUICKLY RESPONDED AND SHIFTED ALL OF OUR FOCUS AND WORK TO CURBING THE SPREAD COPY NINETEEN. YES I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US ALL THAT THERE ARE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS IN EVERYDAY COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL WORK SEPARATE FROM PUBLIC NINETEEN HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOWED DUE TO THE LIMITED CAPACITIES AND STAFFING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE. TO ADDRESS THE CULPRIT NINETEEN HAD TO MAKE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY I'VE BEEN REDEPLOYED AWAY FROM CRITICAL PROGRAMMING. MY EXPERIENCE WITH RESPONDING TO THE CULT IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC INCLUDES NURSE FONG TRIAGE. COBIT NINETEEN ALBERT MANAGEMENT AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WORKSITES EDUCATION SECTOR OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT STRIKING DEPLOYMENT PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REGARDING HOPE IT NINETEEN. BAXEEN ADMINISTRATION AND MASKELL BIT NINETEEN VACCINE ADMINISTRATION AT OUR POINT OF DISPENSING FIGHTS. MY PUBLIC COMPANY COLLEAGUES WORKLOADS HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED TO PRIORITIZE WILL BE NINETEEN RELATED TASKS PLACING OTHER ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE SERVICES SUCH AS MANAGING THE RISE OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. AND ACUTE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES LOWER ON THE PRIORITY LIST. PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF ALSO WORK ON HEALTH EQUITY ISSUES AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES BY DOING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY CHRONIC BURDEN OF DISEASES THIS MARKET HAS ALSO BEEN DE PRIORITIZED UNFORTUNATELY. CALIFORNIA CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS HIT INSTEAD WE MUST INVEST IN AND REBUILD OUR CORE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE NOW. AS A SECOND GENERATION PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY THE OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO THE OBLIGATION TO RECTIFY THIS ONLY WITH THE STATE'S COMMITMENT AN ONGOING FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM MISS BLOOMBERG. MISTER SHARON MEMBERS AMY BLOOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN AN EFFORT TO MORE READILY RECRUIT AND STREAMLINE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS DURING THE PANDEMIC HAS PROPOSED TEMPERATE TEMPORARY NURSE ASSISTANT PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR ELIGIBLE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT CANDIDATES TO BE TRAINED QUICKLY THE PAID DURING THEIR TRAINING AND PROVIDE SERVICES AS THEY BECOME QUALIFIED AND COMPETENT WITH EACH SKILL. CNA'S PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INVALUABLE CARES A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS IT IS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE NEEDED CNA'S TO PROVIDE THIS NECESSARY CARE. IT HAS BEEN EVEN MORE DIFFICULT STRUGGLE WITH THE COBRA NINETEEN PANDEMIC IT IS NOT ONLY CHALLENGING TO FIND C. N. A.'S BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN ACE TO COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM AND GET A TESTING DATE SET TO OBTAIN THEIR CERTIFICATION. FOR MANY FACILITIES AND RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS THERE'S NO LONGER A TRAINING PROGRAM CLOSE BITES TO WORK WITH. AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF CNA'S AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND MORE QUICKLY RECRUIT DIRECT CARE GIVERS SHE MANY STATES HAVE AUTHORIZED THE UTILIZATION OF TEMPORARY NURSE ASSISTANTS. TNA'S ARE PROVIDED WITH INITIAL TRAINING AND ORIENTATION BACKGROUND CHECKS AND HEALTH SCREENS. THEIR CLINICAL TRAINING IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF NURSING STAFF AT THE FACILITY. THEIR CLINICAL COMPETENCY IS OBSERVING COMPLETED PRIOR TO PROVIDING ANY DIRECT CARE SERVICES TO RESIDENTS. AS THEY PERFORM TASKS THIS IS DONE UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF A TRAINED EXPERIENCED CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT AND DIRECTOR OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT. IT IS STIMATED THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL HAVE A ONE TIME COST FOR CDPH SAID PROVED CNA TRAINING REQUIREMENTS OF NO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. CANCER RECENTLY MET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ABOUT ARTICLES TO STREAMLINE THE CURRENT CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT TRAINING PROGRAM ESPECIALLY DURING THE COPA NINETEEN KANSEN NECK. WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR INTEREST IN WORKING ON A SOLUTION AND HOPE TO DISCUSS TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS. ANY STREAMLINED OPTION TO TRAIN AND PROVIDE TIMELY EMPLOYMENT TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING WORK IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WILL HELP ADDRESS THE CURRENT CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF DIRECT CARE STAFF AND NURSING HOMES. THANK YOU. MR VANO. YES THANK YOU SIR SO WE DID MEET WITH THE INDUSTRY AND STAKEHOLDERS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL- AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE COME UP WITH A- INNOVATIVE SOLUTION WHERE WE CAN ADMINISTRATIVELY. MEET THE NEEDS AND THRUST OF WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS PROPOSING MY WAIVER MODIFICATION TO ONE OF OUR- AFL'S ARE ALSO A LETTERS THAT HAS OF COURSE AFFECTED OF REGULATIONS. SO WITH THE OTHER WE CAN MODIFY THAT LETTER TO ALLOW THE TEMPER NURSE ASSISTANT WHO CAN BE EMPLOYED. AT THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY WELL CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A TRAINING PROGRAM WITH ONE OF OUR DISTANCE LEARNING. TRAINING SITES. SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THE TEMPERATURE SYSTEM WE'RE IN ROLE IN ONE OF THESE E. LEARNING PROGRAMS A FURTHER THEIR CLICK THERE ARE TRAINING ON OTHER BOOK TRAINING. AND THEN THEY WILL SHOW UP FOR WORK AT THE LOCAL SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHERE THE- DIRECTOR OF STAFF DEVELOPMENT WE'RE- MY- AND VIEW THE TECHNICAL ARE SKILL. SIGN UP FOR THE COMPANY'S AS- THEY B. AS A BECOME MORE COMPLIANT WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE BASE IN THROUGH THIS CRISIS THE FACILITY WILL BE ABLE TO COUNT THIS TORRENT NURSE ASSISTANT TOWARDS YOUR- THREE POINT FIVE. OF STAFFING REQUIREMENTS WELL THEY GAIN MORE CONGRESS HE'S BECOME A CNA AND ULTIMATELY PASS AT SEA IN THE EXAMINATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH WITH INDUSTRY ON IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED- I WE THIS LANGUAGE. IN THE SENSE THAT. THE PERSON GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE ENVISIONING WOULD PROVIDE THE FULL SCOPE OF TRAINING. TO BECOME A CNA- AS OPPOSED TO THE APPROVING ANOTHER CURRICULUM WHERE THEY WOULD NOT MEET THE FULL CNA CERTIFICATIONS END OF THAT TRAINING. SO WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY OKAY HAVE COME TO US WITH THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KIND OF LOOK INTERNALLY. AND FIND. WHAT WE HOPE IS A SOLUTION- AND MR SOLUTION. WE ARE DRAFTING. REVISIONS TO THE LETTER THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND WE WILL BE SHARING THAT BUT LETTER WITH OUR- STAKEHOLDERS HOPEFULLY TOWARDS THE END OF THIS WEEK MAYBE EARLY NEXT WEEK. FOUR COMMENTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE ON HOW WE CAN. MOVE THAT LETTER FOR SO WE'RE HOPEFUL HOPING THAT WE CAN- HITCHES. WORK MARELLI- WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND GET NEW PROGRAMS UP AND RUNNING FOR. GROWING OR CNA WORK FORCE. THANK YOU SIR. THAT CONCLUDES THIS POINT PANEL I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE- COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THEM THANK YOU TO THE PANEL FOR BRINGING UP THIS DISCUSSION I THINK WHAT WE SEE HERE WITH THIS PROPOSALS BOTH OF THEM COMING FORWARD. IS WHAT'S BEEN LACKING IN THE DISCUSSION OF HAVING THE LOCAL VOICE- BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF- DISCUSSION ON HOW THESE THINGS ARE ROLLING OUT AT THE COUNTY. MYSELF AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN- LOOKING ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS DISTRIBUTION PLAN HOW TO GET THE VACCINES OUT. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. RIGHT SO AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET THE FINANCING PART OF IT. BUT JUST WHEN I GET TO OUR COUNTY AND LEARN ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN WHERE IT'S MOVING- THINGS CHANGE SO NOW YOU HAVE A THIRD PARTY- PERSON COMING INTO. THE HOLY QUESTION SO NOW WE HAVE TO RE ADJUST AND LEARN AND BE ABLE TO ANSWER. OUR CONSTITUENTS- ONE MORE TIME. SO I THINK LOOKING AT THESE PROPOSALS COMING FORWARD- IN THIS- PANEL- HAS THE INPUT OF. OF THOSE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND OFFERING SOLUTIONS TO. A PROBLEM NOT JUST NOW TALKING ABOUT A PROBLEM OF HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THE VACCINES OUT. INTO THE PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED. BUT NOW OFFERING SOME TYPES OF SOLUTIONS. SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD BE USED ON C. N. A.'S THAT ALREADY THERE IN THE GROUP ON THE GROUND. TO BE ABLE TO SPEED UP THAT VACCINE GETTING INTO PEOPLE IN OUR IN OUR AREAS. SO SOLUTIONS THAT ARE THERE AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE I'VE HEARD- IN IN THE PRIOR PANELS I KNOW WE'RE GONNA DIGRESS A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WHERE THE VACCINES WON'T NEED THE DEEP FREEZING COMPONENTS OF IT. BUT YET ISN'T IT RIGHT- YES SOMEONE CAN ANSWER THIS FOR ME. IS THAT WHEN WE GET TO THOSE VACCINES THAT DON'T NEED THAT DEEP FREEZING THE LIKE MODERN AND FISER DO. ALSO THE PERCENTAGE OF HOW- ACTIVE THOSE VACCINES ARE IN COMBAT IN THE BACKSEAT THE- CLOVER NINETEEN STARTS TO DWINDLE ALSO SOBRE TO SAVING THAT. AS AN ANSWER FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND INCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICANS. I THINK WE HAVE MORE DISCUSSION. ON THAT THAT COMPONENT ITSELF. I THINK WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT- THE PROPSAL COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SUB ONE- PROPOSAL ONE STARTS TO TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SITES THAT ARE THERE AND BEING ABLE. HAVE THAT- THE E. VALLEY EVALUATION OF THOSE THAT ARE THERE IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE- HEARING AGAIN FROM THE COUNTIES- C. SACK IN THOSE THAT ARE THERE AND LEARNING NOW FROM THIS PRESENTATION THAT THE SECOND SHOT OF VACCINE IS THE SAME VACCINE THAT'S GIVEN IN THE FIRST ROUND. AND SO FOR HEARING FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT TOOK THAT GOT THE FIRST VACCINE AND NOW ARE ABLE TO GET THE SECOND VACCINE MAKING SURE THE LOGISTICALLY THE INFRASTRUCTURES THERE SO THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS COME BACK. ON WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEING DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE HEARD IN DIFFERENT DISCUSSION OF HOWTHE STATE IN THE THIRD PARTY IN OVERSEEING SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS I GET IT WE SAT ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR SOMETIME AND WE KNOW IT'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THERE COULD BE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT PLANS THAT ARE OUT THERE. BUT WHAT WE SEE HERE NOW TODAY IS THOSE ARE ON THE GROUND LEVEL ACTUALLY MAKING THAT IMPACT- FOR OUR LOCAL CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE THERE AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WERE CARING FOR WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK BEFORE ART WEEK AFTER AS FAR AS CHANGES. TO A DISTRIBUTION PLAN THAT'S HERE I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE. SURE THAT THERE'S SOME TYPE OF LEAD WAY. TO THOSE THAT ARE MINISTER. ON THOSE VACCINES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MEANING HOW CAN YOU PLAN HOW CAN YOU EVEN PLAN A BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING UP DOWN THE ROAD. AND IF YOU PLAN FOR WHAT'S COMING UP DOWN THE ROAD AND IT CHANGES ON YOU. THEN HOW DO YOU QUICKLY MOVE AND ADAPT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE IN THE PUBLIC OUR CONSTITUENTS. TRULY UNDERSTAND I HAVE FAITH IN WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING AND FAITH WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE GOT SO MANY CALLS COMING TO OUR OFFICE ONCE THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. BUT YET WE'RE IS THAT WORK ABILITY WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT I SEE HERE IN THESE TWO PROPOSALS COMING FORWARD. AGAIN I'LL MAKE THAT VOICE BE HEARD THAT I THINK THIS IS THE DISCUSSION THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. FROM THE LOCAL INPUT TO THOSE ON THE GROUND AND OFFERING SOLUTIONS NOT JUST. CRITICIZING THAT THIS PLAN IS IT WORKING OR THIS ISN'T WORKING OF THE STATE OVERSIGHT ISN'T WORKING. A THIRD PARTY NOW IS COMING INTO AND THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK NOW THIS PLAN. STARTS TO OFFER SOLUTIONS AND I THINK IT HAS IT HAS MERIT. IN ITS PRESENTATION. I THINK IT'S A VOICE THAT NEEDS TO BE HEARD. AND AS THINGS START TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD ENCOURAGE- THAT WE LOOK INTO THESE THINGS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. THE FAITH THAT THIS THIS BODY THIS STATE IS MOVING FORWARD IN THE CONTABILIDADE OF THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE. WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT WEEK WHO'S GOING TO THEN BE ALL BE ABLE TO GET THE VACCINE AND YET OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THERE WE HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO ANSWER TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A CALMNESS IN A IN A TRANSITION MOVING FORWARD. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THERE WOULD BE ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH THOSE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MAYBE EVEN SOME TYPE OF A HEADS UP OF WHAT'S GOING TO CHANGE SO THAT PEOPLE COULD REACT TO IT. AND TO CREATE A PLAN THAT STARTS TO COME OUT AS MATT IT YOU KNOW ONCE THERE'S A SOMETHING THAT'S ANNOUNCED. THAT THEN THERE'S A PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL THIS. PAGE SAYING THE SAME. BECAUSE OF WORDS HAVING TO SAY ONE THING. LOCALS ARE SAYING ANOTHER WE HEARD ON THE CALL HERE TODAY THAT IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE BLIND IN THE FOG. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T DO AS ELECTED LEADERS THESE ARE THINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ALL HAVE TO BE SAYING THE SAME MESSAGE. SO THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR BEST WILL IT IS WHAT WE'RE TAKING CARE OF HERE IN THIS IN THIS CHAMBERS. SO WITH THIS MARRIAGE OF THESE TWO PROPOSALS MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S A VOICE THAT'S BEEN MISSING BUT IT ALSO OFFERS A SOLUTION RATHER THAN CRITICIZING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANTED TO ASK- I KNOW READING OVER THESE PROPOSALS THERE'S A REOCCURRING- CONCERN OR OR OR OR ISSUE TO ADDRESS WHICH IS STAFFING AND PERSONNEL NEEDS- DO WE HAVE ENOUGH INDIVIDUALS IN THE PIPELINE BEING TRAINED TO ADDRESS THESE PROPOSALS I KNOW THAT THE THAT THE CHAIR AND NUMBER OF A OF THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE. HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT OVER THE LONG TERM ABOUT JUST SHORTAGES OF STAFF- TRAINING PROGRAMS- PIPELINES PATHWAYS- ESPECIALLY FOR MYSELF AND THOSE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- WE HAVE A CERTAINLY STAFFING CHALLENGES BUT WE OFFICE OBVIOUSLY HAVE. CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE AND GET HIM INTO THE INTO THE AREAS THAT ARE NEEDED SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS OR HOW WOULD WE ASK OUR THOSE CONCERNS ADDRESSING THESE PROPOSALS. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY NAME IS MICHELLE GIVEN THE NAME OF T. ACT AND I AND LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND. I THINK THAT'S SUCH A GREAT QUESTION TO RAISE I KNOW WE HAVE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE IN THE PIPELINE. A PART OF THE REASON WHY WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD THE BILL AB TWO FORTY IS TO NOT JUST LOOK AT THE IMMEDIATE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DO JUST THAT TO HAVE THAT ADEQUATELY SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE IMPACT PLAN IN PLACE. I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK OVER. THE LAST FEW YEARS LOOKING AT TYPE LINES TO HEALTHCARE REPORT I THINK- PART OF THE COMMISSION'S FINDINGS- THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS WITH ONE OF THE TOP WORKFORCE AREAS THAT WE NEEDED TO INVEST IN AS WELL BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME AD. KIND OF INCENTIVES TO DRIVE UP THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES ABOUT CRITICAL WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. SUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES MANY OF THEM ARE REGISTERED NURSES THAT GO ON AND THEY HAVE TO GET ANOTHER CREDIT CREDENTIAL BEYOND TO THE R. N. THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND TAKE ADDITIONAL CLASSES TO GET THAT CERTIFICATION. AND YET- WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED TO GROW THAT PIPELINE AND INCENTIVIZE MORE TO COME INTO THAT FIELD. SO I THINK- PART OF THEIR YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TWO PRONGED APPROACH THE FIRST PRONG IS REALLY LOOKING AT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE RESOURCES FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP THEIR STAFFING CAPACITY BECAUSE YOU HEARD BY DIRECTOR. ABBAS EARLIER TODAY WE DO RISK LOSING MANY OF THE POSITIONS THAT WE STOCK UP OR THROUGH COLD. THEY COULD THEN BE TRANSLATED TO WORKING ON OTHER THINGS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S THE FIRST APPROACH IS GETTING THE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR STAFFING AND SELECT. STAFFING COULD BE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WHAT WE ALSO HAVE IS A LOT OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT REQUIRES YOU TO ONLY HAVE A STAFF THAT CAN DO THIS DISEASE ONLY AND CAN'T REALLY TRANSLATE TO OTHER THINGS. BUT THE SECOND PRONG APPROACH IS REALLY AT AND. THE REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THE STUDY TO BE FUNDED AS A THAT WE CAN REALLY LOOK AT. OKAY HOW DO WE GET THIS WORK FOR. WHAT'S WHAT DOES THE WORK FIRST TO LOOK LIKE IN A LITTLE. DEPART BUT WHEN HE IT ALSO. TO LOOK AT IN ORDER TO IN. THAT WE- SKILLED AND HIGHLY TRAINED STAFF AND- AGAIN PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY. LABORATORY AND- OTHERS. MANY CLASSIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE HIGHLY SKILLED AND SPECIALIZED. R. AS THE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THAT THAT RESPONSE AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU I KNOW THE CHAIR HAS BEEN VERY PASSIONATE UNITED TALKED ABOUT EXPANDING PROGRAMS GREEN PATHWAYS- ESPECIALLY FOR US IN THE CENTER VALLEY. THE CHAIR KNOWS THAT WE HAVE A WE HAVE A NEED FOR THOSE SPECIALIST SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE AND THE CHAIR ON THIS- YOU KNOW CREATING THOSE PROGRAMS EXPAND THOSE PROGRAMS AND GREEN AS PATHWAYS. ARE ESSENTIAL TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND I THINK THAT'S- THE REAL ONCERN I DO AGREE WITH US AROUND US.THE PROGRAM THE- FOURTEENTH BUT PUSHED OUT BUT- WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES TOO. THANK YOU. I WILL MENTION JUST A COMMON WITHOUT. INHERENTLY HAVING TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT REALLY WANTED TO- FOLLOW UP WITH WITH WHAT MESS AUSSIE HAD SAID. WHICH WAS IN REGARDS TO- THERE ARE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY HAVE NOT BECOME COUNTY. DEPARTMENTS OF COVERT NINETY SIX. AND SO IF WERE LISTENING EFFECTIVELY TO THE DIRECTOR BOSS. I REALLY WANT TO ECHO IN AGREE WITH HER THAT WE CAN'T WAIT TO REACT. THAT WE DO HAVE TO. LEVERAGE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND TACKLING DR KELLY WE HAVE TO USE COPING. NINETEEN AS AN EXCEL AROUND FOR US TO CHANGE. NOW WITH SO MUCH FOCUS AND EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC HEALTH THIS YEAR- SHAME ON US IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO. CONTINUE TO ELEVATE- THOSE WHO ARE WORKING IN PUBLIC HEALTH STUDENTS WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS AREA. TO GO AND FOCUS IN THIS AREA THERE ARE SO MANY CONCERNS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR POOR AND ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT. I REALLY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO. CAPTURE THIS MOMENT AND TO RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC STRONGER THAN WE WENT IN. WITH THAT- WE WILL MOVE ON FROM ISSUE FOR AND GO TO KENNEL FIVE. WHERE WE WILL HAVE SEVEN PRESENTERS. IT WILL BEGIN WITH MISS BLOOMBERG. THEN MISS MURRAY'S MYSTERIOUS MISS FLORI- AND WE WILL GO DIRECTLY DOWN FROM THERE SO IF WE CAN START WITH MISS BLOOMBERG PLEASE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMY BLOOMBERG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT IMMEDIATE STAFFING NEEDS OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DO TEN PRESIDENTE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. COUPLED WITHAN ALREADY COMPRESSED AND COMPETITIVE EMPLOYEE MARKET CAP IS PROPOSING THAT MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR STAFFING AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HE PAID AT A 100% OF COST. WE BELIEVE THIS INFUSION OF FUNDS WILL PLACE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND A MORE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND THE WORK FORCE MARKET PLACE AS THESE HOMES TRYING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED QUALIFIED DIRECT CARE STAFF. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS TO PAY COMPETITIVE WAGES UNDER A MEDIC HOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT'S-CURRENTLY CAPS LIMITED BY BUDGET FUNDS AND PAID TO FACILITIES TO YEARS AND ARREARS. WE ARE ALSO SEEING INCREDIBLE STAFFING CHALLENGES AND LONG TERM CARE AS EMPLOYEES NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF FOR MANY REASONS INCLUDING QUARANTINE DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN EXPOSURE. CHILD CARE ISSUES AND SICK OR PAID FAMILY LEAVE. BY PAYING SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT A 100% OF THEIR LABOR COSTS AND A TIMELY MANNER. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE ADDED SUPPORT AND FUNDS TO OFFER WAGES TO ATTRACT AND KEEP THEIR DIRECT CARE STAFF. THE CURRENT MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO REIMBURSE NURSING FACILITIES ON A FACILITY BASED ATTITUDE AND PREDETERMINED COST. BASED RATES UNFORTUNATELY FACILITY RATES ARE NOT ACTUALLY STRUCTURED SO FULLY FUND NURSING FACILITY COSTS OF LABOR. RATES ARE FIRST SETS AT THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE OF NURSING FACILITIES LABOR COSTS. ARE FURTHER LIMITED BASED ON A FACILITIES GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THEN ADDITIONALLY THE RATES ARE REDUCED BY THE STATE'S OVERALL PROGRAMMATIC BUDGETARY LIMITS. BY REMOVING THE LABOR PORTION OF RATES FROM THE LESSER PERCENTILE THE GEOGRAPHIC CAPPING AND THE OVERALL BUDGETARY LIMITS LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WILL BE ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED FOR THEIR LABOR COSTS. AND PROVIDED ASSURANCES THAT IF THEY INCREASE WAGES MEDIC HOW RATES WILL FULLY REFLECT THE INCREASES PAID. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE TRAINING FEDERAL APPROVALS FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS TO SEE IF A COMPROMISE SOLUTION CAN BE REACHED. SH. THANK YOU MR MURRAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA I APPRECIATE BEING HERE TODAY MY NAME IS ERICA MARIE I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HOUSES. WE REPRESENTATIVE TWENTY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BUT INCLUDE COUNTY OWNED OR AFFILIATED SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE FIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTERS. THESE SYSTEMS PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO ROUGHLY THREE MILLION PATIENTS EACH YEAR. MOST OF OUR PATIENTS ARE EITHER ON ANOTHER CALL I MET CAL OR UNINSURED. MANY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS IMMIGRANTS OR HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY KOPET NINETEEN IN OTHER WAYS. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC OUR SYSTEMS HAVE PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE LARGELY IN FOUR KEY WAYS FIRST WE REDESIGNED OUR HOSPITALS AND EXPANDED CAPACITY TO PREPARE FOR AND THEN RESPOND TO RECORD INCREASES IN HOSPITALIZATIONS. THIS REQUIRED OVERHAULING OPERATIONS TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF BEDS SET UP ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES IT PULLS STAFF FROM OUTPATIENT CENTERS TO HELP WITH IMPATIENT NEEDS. SECOND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED- ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY TODAY WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING AND DISTRIBUTING VACCINES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTERS PARTICIPATED IN ALL PHASE THREE TRIALS FOR THE VISOR IN MATERNAL VACCINES AND ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL IN THE LOCAL PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON REACHING LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. THIRD WE'VE INCREASED TESTING DESPITE THE SURGE IN THE ROLLOUT OF THE VACCINE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE MAINTAINED THEIR TESTING CAPABILITY. AND FOURTH AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS DISCUSSION WE PROVIDED TARGETED SUPPORT AND NOT REACH TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY. VISITING LOCAL FARMS AND PACKING FACILITIES TO DISBURSE MASKS AND PROVIDE TRAININGS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ON SOCIAL DISTANCING AND HOW TO ACCESS CARE GOING TO LOCAL NURSING HOMES TO PROVIDE TRAINING ON HOW TO USE GPS IS. ACTUAL CONTROL AND DEPLOYING STREET TEAMS TO PROVIDE TESTING ON THE GROUND EDUCATION FOR HOMELESS POPULATIONS ON HOW TO STAY SAFE. SO SUPPORT THESE FOR ROLES AND MAINTAIN SYSTEM OPERATIONS PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN LEVERAGING ALL AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCES. INCLUDING PROVIDING RELIEF FUNDS. BMO SUPPORTS CARES ACTED AND FLEXIBILITY THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THROUGH AN EMERGENCY MEDICAID WAIVER. BUT CRITICAL GAPS REMAIN. PLEASE SINCE AUGUST WE HAVE SEEN AN INPATIENT VOLUME INCREASE OF NEARLY 30% AND R. I. C. U. VOLUME HAS NEARLY DOUBLED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF COOK AT NINETEEN. BECAUSE PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO PUT UP THE NON FEDERAL SHARE FOR INPATIENT MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS MANY OF THESE COSTS HAVE GONE ON REIMBURSED. WE'VE HAD TO SHIFT SERVICES AWAY FROM OUTPATIENT SETTINGS WHERE WE DO RECEIVE STATE GENERAL FUND TO CARE FOR INPATIENT ESPECIALLY I. C. U. PH. AND THEREFORE WE ARE SEEKING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IN THIS BUDGET REQUEST SHE SUPPORT THESE UNREIMBURSED COSTS AS WELL AS COSTS RELATED TO VACCINES AND TO STAFFING ME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY DURING THIS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIME PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE AN ENORMOUS ASSET ASSET TO CALIFORNIA AND WE STAND READY TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN. THANK YOU FOR THE CAN YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST. THANK YOU MR MURRAY MISTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS M. J. DíAS AND I WILL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ON TOP OF THAT COS ARE SEIU MEMBER WHO COULD NO LONGER MAKE TODAY'S HEARING I WILL BE READING A BRIEF STATEMENT ON HER BEHALF AND I WILL BEGIN NOW WE ARE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE APPROVE THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET REQUEST OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS SERVING A LARGE NUMBER OF COLD IN NINETEEN MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS AS WELL AS FUNDING TO SUPPORT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION AND ADDITIONAL STAFFING AS AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER AT HIGHLAND HOSPITAL IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA I NEED VERY SICK PATIENTS IN THE ER AND SCREEN THEM TO DETERMINE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE OR PAY OR SOURCES OVER 90% OF THE TIME IT'S MEDIC COW. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW THE SICKEST PEOPLE TRY SO HARD TO AVOID SEEKING CARE EVEN WENT COLD IN NINETEEN BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE COST OF HOSPITAL CARE I'VE HELP UNINSURED DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS WHAT COLD ED NAVIGATE. DIFFERENT S. A. L. FOR. SUCH AS COVERED. OR OUR ALLEN YOU COUNTY SPECIFIC INDIGENT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS IF THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED WHICH AS YOU KNOW THESE COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE VERY LIMITED. THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT WORKING ON A SAFETY NET HOSPITAL IS THAT WE DO NOT TURN PEOPLE AWAY UNLIKE OTHER HOSPITALS. WE TAKE THE BRUNT AND SERVE THE SICKEST PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. MOST OF WHICH ARE OUR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I'VE SEEN HOW OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL RECEIVED MANY PATIENT TRANSFERS FROM DIFFERENT HOSPITALS GIVEN OUR ROLE AS A SAFETY NET. OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH DRAMATIC SURGE OF POSITIVE CASES AND HOSPITALIZATION AS A PANDEMIC WERE WORSENED. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WILL BREAK AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL HOSPITAL CARE TO THE SICKEST PATIENTS MOST OF WHICH ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. ARE FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND MORE PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BUDGET REQUEST THAT WILL HELP HELPED IN OUR PUBLIC PARKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME WILL MOVE TO- MISS FLOORING. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES OKAY. GOOD AFTER A GOOD EVENING THIS IS JENNIFER LAURIE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- IN ADDITION TO THE SHARP FOCUS BEING PLACED ON HEALTH DISPARITIES DUE TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE ALSO TURNED RENEWED ATTENTION TO THE BARRIERS ELIGIBLE PEOPLE FACE WHEN THEY NEED MATTER HOW. WHILE MOST PEOPLE WATCHING EXPECTED A RECORD HIGH MACCALLUM MOMENT GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSS IN CALIFORNIA THE PROJECTED CHANGE IN ENROLLMENT HAS NOT BORNE OUT. WHEN BARRIERS TO ENROLLMENT EXIST DISPARITIES ARE EXACERBATED AND THE HIT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST. CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH DH CS AND OTHERS TO- TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH MEDIC CALLIN ROMANCE AND TO WORK ON OUT REGION OTHER ISSUES- AND TO THEIR CREDIT DH CS HAS WORKED HARD WITH CONSUMER ADVOCATES TO BEGIN TO ROLL OUT AT POSTON ROMAN VERIFICATION OF INCOME. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO IMPLEMENT INTO ALL OF THE RELEVANT ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS INCOME VERIFICATION IS OFTEN THE ONE THING THAT HOLDS UP A MEDIC CAL APPLICATION AND WHEN SOMEONE LOSES A JOB OR HAS THEIR HOURS REDUCED THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY SUCH AS TAX OR PAYROLL INFORMATION. IS RARELY UPDATED QUICKLY ENOUGH. TO BE OF USE AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION. DURING THE EXISTING HEALTH CRISIS DH CS HAS BEEN ABLE TO USE FEDERAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES TO SIMPLIFY ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION ALLOWING COUNTY WORKERS TO DO MUCH MORE OVER THE PHONE. ONCE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY THAT IS ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. WE KNOW THAT THE NEED FOR MEDICARE WON'T AND WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTHEMERGENCY IS LIFTED AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONCE THE RELATED MORATORIUM ON MEDICAL TERMINATIONS IS LIFTED. BUT THE COUNTY WORKERS WILL NEED TO CONDUCT MILLIONS OF REDETERMINATION. GIVEN THIS CONTEXT WE WOULD LIKE TO REVISIT THE RELIANCE ON SWORN PAPER AFFIDAVITS WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS TO GIVE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THEIR INCOME OR PROPERTY DOES NOT MATCH AVAILABLE RECORDS. OR OTHER LIMITED TIMES WHEN RECORDS ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE AND SELF ATTESTATION IS PERMITTED UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS. D. H. CS HAS EXISTING GUIDANCE TO GET OUT CALORIES ON HOW TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO SELF TEST OVER THE PHONE BUT THE PART OF THIS GUIDANCE. PART OF THIS GUIDANCE AS PERMISSIVE AS ITS CURRENT STATE LAW AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE REQUIREMENT FOR PAPER AFFIDAVITS UNCIRCUMCISED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. REQUIRING PAPER IS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO COMPLETING APPLICATIONS OR RENEWALS AND DOES NOT ALIGN WITH MANY OF THE NO WRONG DOOR EFFORTS IMPLEMENTED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THE EASIEST METHOD OF APPLYING FOR RENEWING METCALF. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHEN SOMEBODY RENEWS MEDIC HOW I COUNTY WORKER IS REQUIRED TO LOOK AT EVERY ALL THE OTHER INFORMATION THEY HAVE IN THE COUNTY FILE TO TRY TO HIT ELECTRONIC RESOURCES FOR MATCHING- THE DATA THAT THE PERSON HAS PROVIDED- OR THAT THEY ALREADY HAD ON FILE. WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN COUNTY WORKERS REACH OUT TO THE PERSON- TYPICALLY THEY DO THIS OVER THE PHONE AND THEY USUALLY MAKE TWO ATTEMPTS- IF THEY ARE ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF THAT PERSON IF WE WERE ALLOWING FOR TELEPHONIC ATTESTATION AND THEY HAVE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE INCOME DOESN'T MATCH. THE ISSUE WOULD BE RESOLVED THEN AND THERE- WITHOUT THAT THE PERSON HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A SWORN AFFIDAVIT SIGNED IT YOU GET IT IN THE MAIL OR GET IT OVER TO THE COUNTY. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRANSPORTATION LIMITATIONS OR WHO- JUST DON'T HAVE EASY WAYS TO DO THINGS OVER THE INTERNET. AND I'LL BLOW THINGS TO A WORKER. SO WHEN THE ROOT. ARE RULES ALLOW FOR SELF ATTESTATION. AT TESTING OVER THE PHONE OR ELECTRONICALLY SHOULD BE JUST AS ACCEPTED AS IN PAPER- DH CS MAY NEED TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH THE FEDERAL. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES AS TO HOW TO DO TELEPHONIC VERIFICATION WHEN I COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE TELEPHONIC SIGNATURE CAPABILITY OR THAT CAPABILITY ISN'T WORKING WE EXPECT THAT IS THAT DISCUSSION TO BE ABOUT HOW TO ACCURATELY TELL DOCUMENT A TELEPHONIC SAID SIGNATURE. NOT WHETHER ONE IS ALLOWED AT ALL IN PRACTICAL TERMS DH CS WOULD BE MAKING VERY MINOR CHANGES TO ITS MAGIC ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PLAN OR STATE PLAN FILED WITH CMS SUCH AS THE LEADING THE WORD PAPER FROM THE PHRASE PAPER DOCUMENTATION. OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR PLANS IN SHORT THIS SMALL TECHNICAL CHANGE TO ALLOW APPLICATIONS AND RENEWALS TO BE MORE EASILY PROCESS IF WE'RE ACCEPTING SOMEONE'S WORD IT SHOULD BE EQUAL ACCEPTED VERBALLY AS IT IS IN WRITING. AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WE SHOULD MINIMIZE THE BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE FACE AN APPLYING FOR IN KEEPING THEIR MEDIC CAL PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT DUE TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FLORI. MISS CROSS SIMILAR. GOOD EVENING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS LUCY QUESTION A LOT I'M HERE THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS WHICH IS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IN LOS ANGELES THAT SERVES THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS EACH MONTH. THE CLIENTS HAVE BEEN C. H. ACCESS OUR FAMILIES OF HIS DENTAL HEALTH WORKERS PREDOMINANTLY IN LATINO COMMUNITIES AND MANY OF THEM ARE IMMIGRANTS OR WITH MIXED STATUS FAMILIES. IN SOME OF THESE ARE COMMUNITIES AT THE EPICENTER OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN AND DAMAGE IN CALIFORNIA. MEDIC COBIT NINETEEN UNINSURED PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT REGARD TO CITIZENSHIP OR IMMIGRATION STATUS AND IT'S A KEY MEDICAL PROGRAM IT COVERS TESTING FOR KOBE. AND CO RELATED MEDICAL TREATMENT INCLUDING INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE AS A PREVIOUS ANALYST MENTIONED MANY IN THIS COMMUNITY MORE AID. GOING TO THE HOSPITAL EVEN WITH KOBE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY. SO DISSEMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT MEDIC HOUSE COBIT NINETEEN. COVERAGE AND MAKING THE PROCESS CONSUMER FRIENDLY SO THAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES CAN BE INCLUDED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THIS PROGRAM OR PARAMOUNT. FOR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE APPLICATION FORM FOR MEDIC CAL SCOBIE NINETEEN OPTIONS SURE TO PROGRAM AND THE WAY INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ABOUT STATUS BE MODIFIED. GENERAL MATHS COULD STILL BE CLAIMS WHICH OF COURSE IS ESSENTIAL. BUT WE REALLY NEED TO IMPROVE THE WAY THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED SO THAT FAMILIES WILL BE LESS AFRAID. TO FLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. CHANGES WHAT ARE X. IT IN. OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT CAN BE UNDER. BY THE LOCAL LATINO HEALTH TASK FORCES AND OTHERS WHO ARE COLLABORATING WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ENTITIES AND COMMUNITY CLINICS WHO ARE THE PROVIDERS CERTIFIED TO USE THE PLATFORM OR RULE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THIS ISSUE FOR SOME TIME AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT FEELS THAT. CURRENT FEDERAL GUIDANCE- BE AND HERE TO A SOLUTION WITH ALL DUE RESPECT HE DISAGREED WITH THAT INTERPRETATION OF THE SHIFTING CHANNELS BY. WHAT HARM WOULD THERE BE AN ASKING THE PRIVATE MINISTRATION WORK CLARIFICATION WORK IF NECESSARY ADDITIONAL MORE COMPLETE FEDERAL GUIDANCE TO HELP CALIFORNIA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. CONTROL TO HELP AFTER DOES THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING IN OUR AND ENROLLMENT IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS THE CONCERN INTERFERE ABOUT QUESTIONS BEING ASKED FOR STATUS AND WHO CAN BLAME THE COMMUNITY AFTER ALL THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST BOOSTERS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT'S COBIT AND INSURED PROGRAM CALIFORNIA WAS OUT THE GATE EARLY IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WITH WHAT IT THEN CALLED THE P. E. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR COPING PROGRAM. AND WE APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT FOR ITS INNOVATION IT'S INITIATIVE AND ITS CREATIVITY AND HAVING CREATED THAT AS THE STATE ONLY PROGRAM WHICH NOW IS BEING MATCHED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGH THIS NEW META CAL COBIT CATEGORY. IT REMAINS OPEN TO ALL IMMIGRANTS AND I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THAT STATUS IS NOT A DISQUALIFIER. BUT THE CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT THE WAY QUESTIONS ARE ASKED IS A DETERRENT TO MANY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. AS OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE NOTED UNFORTUNATELY THIS PANDEMIC AND ITS CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH US FOR A WHILE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ITSELF ASSUMES THAT FOR THE MEDIC HOW BUDGET. THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FEDERALLY DECLARED WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST UNTIL THE END OF THIS YEAR. WE KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS MANY OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE BURDENED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ALL THE WORK THAT IS TO BE DONE. BUT WE RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM OF MAKING THE COVERED UNINSURED MEDICAL APPLICATION PROCESS MORE CONSUMER FRIENDLY SO THAT IT CAN BE DEPLOYED IN COMMUNITIES TO REACH THE FARM WORKERS TO REACH THE FOOD WORKERS. TO REACH PEOPLE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHERE MANY IMMIGRANTS LIVE WORK AND GATHER MUST BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE OTHER ISSUE I WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS. CONCERNS HOW THE MEDICAL PROGRAM COVERS BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING COSTS AND THE MONITORS THEMSELVES DURING PREGNANCY AND GENERALLY. WHY IS THIS SEEMINGLY DETAILED SMALL ISSUE APPROPRIATE FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. IN SHORT RACIAL EQUITY IN BIRTH OUTCOMES IN OUR STATE. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THERE'S A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN IN HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE HYPERTENSION AND RELATED DISORDERS THAT CAN KILL PEOPLE AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY A CONCERN DURING PREGNANCY IN CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN ARE FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS OTHER POPULATIONS TO DIE AS A RESULT OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS. AFRICAN AMERICAN NEWBORNS EXPERIENCE INFANT MORTALITY RATES TWICE AS HIGH AS OTHER NEWBORNS IN CALIFORNIA AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE CODE PANDEMIC HAS MET WITH ADDITIONAL STRESS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND ALREADY UNDER SERVE ACCESS. TO MEDICAL CARE AND SERVICES. THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT ARE DOING AMAZINGLY EVIDENCED BASED WORK TRYING TO GET OUT THESE ISSUES THE MANY PERINATAL HEALTH EQUITY INITIATIVES THAT THE STATE AND OTHER ENTITIES ARE NOW SUPPORTING. BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING SELF MONITORING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND BEYOND IS A CRITICAL PART OF THESE INITIATIVES TO GET OUT COULD JUST TO GET OUT THE DISPARITIES IN BIRTH OUTCOMES. AT PRESENT MEDI CAL PLANS HAVE THE CHOICE TO PROVIDE THIS ACCESS TO THE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING EQUIPMENT AS EITHER A PHARMACY BENEFIT. OR AS DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEN IT'S PROVIDED AS PHARMACY. THE PRENATAL CARE PROVIDER NEEDS SIMPLY EMAIL THE PRESCRIPTION TO THE PHARMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S CHOICE AND IT CAN BE READY THE SAME DAY FOR HER TO PICK UP RIGHT THERE AND SHE'S LEAVING THE CLINIC OR SHE PREFERS ON HER WAY HOME OR IN HER NO HOME NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE EVER THE CASE MAY BE. IN CONTRAST WHEN THE BENEFIT AS SOME OTHER PLANS DO IS COVERED AS DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THERE ARE LONG DELAYS AND THIS IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN THESE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. ONE APRIL FIRST THE DEPARTMENT PLANS TO LAUNCH. A MAJOR CHANGE IN THE WAY MEDICARE L. DELIVERS THE PHARMACY BENEFIT THROUGH MEDICARE ARE EX WE ARE AMONG THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A MAJOR IMPORTANT UNDERTAKING. INVOLVING MANY PARTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALL ASPECTS OF THE MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEM. IN SOMEONE ONE MIGHT ASK WHY FOCUS ON ONE SMALL PIECE OF THIS BENEFIT. THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AWAY TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE UNIQUE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION IN THIS CRISIS AND DURING PREGNANCY. OUR REQUEST IS THAT AT THE VERY LEAST. THE HEALTH PLANS BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE GOING FORWARD WITH THE CHOICE TO CONTINUE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THIS BENEFIT AS PHARMACY EASY QUICK SIMPLE TIMELY ACCESS TO SAVE LIVES AND FURTHER DOWN THE LINE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE PLANS TO BRING EVERYONE ON BOARD THE US SURGEON GENERAL HAS RECENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT SELF MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE BE DONE AND ALL PREGNANCIES. AND THIS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE NECESSARY THAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC WENT IN PERSON PRENATAL CARE VISITS ARE NOT HAPPENING AND AS WE GO FORWARD WITH TELL THEM TELEMEDICINE WHERE THAT WILL BE A MODALITY USE MORE COMPLETELY. THANK YU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND WE ARE READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MA'AM I MAY HAVE DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR COOPER COMMENT ON THE FIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN PRESENT. DR ARAMBULA COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALBOM. TWENTY WITH YOU ALL MOVED I'M GOING TO START WITH. BRIEF OBSERVATION ABOUT ACROSS FROM- COST REGARDING OTHER NURSING SOLELY LABOR COSTS AS MISS BLOOMBERG SAID ON KERR IS WORKING. BUT DH C. S. ON WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WHAT IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL- HE AS YOU PROBABLY RECALL- THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC WE ARE PROVIDING A 10% RATE BUMP ON TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. ALL LATER THIS YEAR WE'RE STARTING ON FOCUSED CONVERSATION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS- TO. BRING TOGETHER THE CONCEPTS- OE OF THE BEST AND MOST ADEQUATE RATES BUT ALSO HOW DO THEY MAKE TO QUALITY WE DON'T WANT HER WALKER SOLD CENTER COST BASED APPROACH ROAD. BUT WE WANT ONE THAT. COMPASSES QUALITY DEMENTIA. OF DECEMBER WELL THE CALIFORNIA CARE FOR. SURE OF COURSE ALL CODED IMPACT SINCE GOVERNOR SO. SERVE BUT DATABASE THEN HAD ALL THE FRENCH- RESIDENTS SAFETY WAS A FACTOR OF FIVE OR SO TO ONE BETWEEN FOR PROFIT AND NONPROFIT NURSING FACILITIES SO THEY'RE CLEARLY ON QUALITY ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS- MISS COOPER I THINK MAY HAVE SOME. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. GOOD EVENING EVERYONE SO WALK THROUGH ADDITIONAL- FLAGS ON THE ON THE KAFIR PUZZLE AND THEN ADDRESS EACH OF THE OTHER I PROPOSALS- AS WELL. UNTIL JUST A FEW THINGS AND IN ADDITION TO WILL'S COMMENTS- THE CLARIFY FROM THE AGENDA RIGHT UP THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE CAP IS UTILIZED. UTILIZED TO LIMIT THE LABOR COSTS TO THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE WITHIN THE FACILITIES- GROUPING THE CAP ONLY IMPACTED FORTY FIVE OUT OF THE ONE THOUSAND AND IN THIRTY ONE FACILITIES WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR BASED ON ON THE RIGHT AFTER. ALSO A. B. EIGHTY ONE- UPDATED THE PEER GROUPINGS TO BE MORE ACCURATE- IN REGARDS TO REFLECTING COST AND THE CAP WAS RAISED FROM NINETY PERCENTILE TO NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE STARTING IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY FORWARD- AB EIGHTY ONE- ALSO PROVIDED FACILITIES WITH EIGHTY THREE POINT SIX TWO PERCENT. A RATE INCREASE OF FOR THE BRIDGE CARRIES BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT 5% RATE INCREASE FOR CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THESE ARE IN ADDITION TO THE 10% DH CS RATE INCREASE THAT WAS PROVIDED TO LONG TERM CARE FACILITY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES IN WHICH WILL WAS REFERENCING- THAT 10% INCREASE. WAS THERE TO YOU- ACKNOWLEDGED THE HIGHER COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH INCLUDED INCREASED LABOR COSTS- ADDITIONALLY- THE DEPARTMENT WANTED TO RAISE A FEW CONCERNS. AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION. BY MISS BLOOMBERG- THAT WE ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE ARE STILL HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE UPPER PAYMENT LIMIT LIMIT. SO FEDERAL LIMITATIONS ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE TO BE REIMBURSED- BASED ON THE UPPER LIMIT- AND THE DEPARTMENT IS. FIVE SORRY OF THE 10% INCREASE THAT IS CURRENTLY- IN PLACE FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH CMS ON NOT. ON ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS- THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY PUT THAT IN JEOPARDY IN REGARDS TO GETTING THOSE APPROVALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY SINCE WE ALREADY WENT OUT FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD REGARDING THE INCREASED RATES THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ON STARTING EFFECTIVE AUGUST FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- THAT COULD BE AT RISK IF WE HAD TO BOTH- BACK IN HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH CMS REGARDING THESE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS- I WOULD ALSO NOTES THAT- THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RETRO BACK TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS PROPOSED- IT ALSO COULD POTENTIALLY PUT THE MANAGED CARE RATES IN JEOPARDY AS THOSE ARE CURRENTLY PENDING. WITH CMS UP FOR. REVIEW AS WELL AND- AND THAT WOULD BE A LARGE CHALLENGE FOR US TO OVERCOME- AND AS WELL MENTIONED REALLY ON THIS PROPOSAL I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY FOCUSED ON. A WORKING CLOSELY WITH- THE INDUSTRY IN REGARDS TO REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGIES THAT REALLY THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS NOT ONLY ON COST- BUT ALSO ON QUALITY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THAT NO- NO LATER THAN SEPTEMBER FIRST- SO THAT IS OUR CONSCIENCE OF REGARDING THE- CAP. PROPOSAL I WILL NOW TURN THE- TO THE PROPOSED BY HELP. SO OF PUBLIC- REGARDING IN MEDIC CALIFIA FOR SERVICE- KOBE PATIENTS ON THE DEPARTMENT. HAS GONE THROUGH AND EVALUATED WHAT WAS IN THAT PROPOSAL ON IT IS CORRECT THAT PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE REIMBURSED. AT WHAT'S CALLED CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE METHODOLOGY. BASED ON COST WHERE THE NON FEDERAL SHARE IS PROVIDED BY THE PUBLIC CONSTABLE SYSTEM. BASED ON OFSTED REPORTS THIRTY PERCENT- IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION BE FILL OF THE PERCENT OF PATIENTS ON MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS THEY ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO- WE ALSO CAN CONFIRM BASED ON DATA THAT WE HAVE SUCH A 65% IS AN ACCURATE PERCENTAGE- WHEN COMPARED TO TOTAL FUNDING PAYMENTS. AGAINST UNCOMPENSATED CARE COSTS WHEN CONSIDERING BOTH A MEDIC CAL ON AND UNINSURED POPULATIONS. BASED ON OUR CURRENT DATA WE ALSO- DO YOU SEE ON THAT THERE HAS BEEN A VERY HIGH RATE OF FEE FOR SERVICE- KOBE CASES- A LOT HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OUR MANAGED CARE POPULATION TO BE. A CLEAR- FOR EXAMPLE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FOR SERVICE OUR RESEARCH HAD COULD BE CASES. PURSES AND MANAGED CARE ONLY A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND- AS A COMPARISON. WE ALSO ARE NOT HIGHER UP FOR SERVICE YOUR UTILIZATION IN TWENTY TWENTIES THAN IN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN MANAGED CARE- AS WELL AS AS- LOWER UTILIZATION OF THE OUTPATIENT CARE. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR FUTURE SERVICE VERSUS MANAGED CARE- THAT COMPARISON IS QUITE STARK I WITH 480-004-0090 PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF YOU FOR SERVICE VERSUS. 850-002-0010 PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUTPATIENT VISITS IN MANAGED CARE. AND FORWARD. CONTINUING TO WORK AND PARTNER WITH OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS- AS THEY HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN AND THE CO THAT NINETY RESPOND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN REGARD TO THE WESTERN CENTER LOS POVERTY RELATED TO THE TELE SELF ESTES AT THE STATION A MEDIC CAL APPLE- HERE WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- THE POLICY REQUIRING WRITTEN SIGNATURE ON AFFIDAVIT OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BASED ON OUR INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. ON IS WHAT IS OUTLINED IN OUR CURRENT CALIFORNIA MANAGE AYE VERIFICATION PLANHOWEVER I. G. H. YES IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ADVOCATES IN IS SEEKING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM CMS ON THIS VERY THING- ON ALLOWING TELEPHONIC SIGNATURES ON AFFIDAVITS- FOR OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ARMED IF CMS AGREES WITH OUR APPROACH- THEN WE WOULD NEED TO AMEND OUR NATURAL VERIFICATION PLAN IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT. THIS PROPOSAL- IN MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PROPOSAL OVER THE- TO THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ACCESS. RELATED TO THE CODE NINETEEN UNINSURED- APPLICATION SIMPLIFICATION- SO AS J. DH CS WAS. AS IMAGINE WANTED FIRST DATES OUT THE GATE I TO COVER THE CODE NINETEEN UNINSURED GROUP THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE FAMILIES FIRST CORONA RESPONSE ACT- WE DID. IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT THAT IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWO- THROUGH PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY. AFTER THAT LAUNCH AND THROUGH MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH CMS- THEY PROVIDED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO ALL STATES- IN SPECIFIC A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA IN WHICH TIME BE RELAUNCHED AN AUTOMATED PORTAL WITH A NEW APPLICATION- THAT. IN IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND THE NEW APPLICATION WAS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RULES- SPECIFICALLY CMS REQUIRES STATES TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH AN APPLICATION THAT COLLECTS CONTACT INFORMATION SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SEDITION STEP IMMIGRATION AN ATTESTATION THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT ROLLED IN ANY OTHER FEDERALLY FUNDED. COVERAGE OR SIGNATURE- HOWEVER GIVEN THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY- WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH AND PROVIDED AN ADMINISTRATION ON ANY CHANGES TO THE POLICY AS WE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. ARE PRIOR. AND ALLOW WEEK REGARDING METRO CHILD HEALTH ACCESS RELATED TO YOU- BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS AT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO HEALTH EQUITY AND ENSURING THAT BLOOD PRESSURE DOCTORS ARE AVAILABLE AND THE FEE FOR SERVICE. AND MANAGED CARE- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PHARMACY OR MEDICAL BENEFITS VERSUS. BEING ABLE TO BILL BY A PHARMACY OR MEDICAL PIECE AND ALL KIND OF EXPLAIN SOME OF THAT IN HERE AS WELL- BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE WORST YEAR MEDICARE DOES COVER THREE TYPES OF BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS. THE FIRST ONE IS BLOOD PRESSURE COSTS WITH US THAT THE STETHOSCOPE SKEWS ME. A BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF AS WELL AS AUTOMATED BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS. IN DEEPER SERVICE ON THESE DEVICES ARE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION HOWEVER THEY DO YOU NEED PRICING I MEAN THEY'RE BUILT BY REPORTS AND THEY ARE CATEGORIZED- INTERNET ACCOUNT AS A MEDICAL BENEFITS- AND SO. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT A PARTICULAR. ITEM IT'S ALSO CATEGORIZED AS DM ME I'M IN SO THERE IS THAT REQUIREMENTS- THAT IS BUILT ON THE ON THE MEDICAL SIDE AS WE CURRENTLY DON'T COVER IT IN OUR- PHARMACY BENEFIT HOWEVER. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS IMPLEMENTING THIS SPRING IT SHOULD BE A ROLE THAT SOON OF THAT PHARMACIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO FILL. ON THE MEDICAL SIDE THAT DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND WE DO THINK THAT WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO- THE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEMS AVAILABLE ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE. RIGHT HOWEVER 80% OR SO OF OUR BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE SERVICES ON THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE SIDE- AND YOU CAN RECEIVE THE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR. FROM DM ME- SUPPLIED BY EITHER A PHARMACY. OR PROVIDERS. OR DME PROVIDER- AND THAT MAY VERY DEPENDING ON THE PLAN BUT THE MAJORITY OF WOULD BE THERE- INDIAN ME WILL REMAIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MINISTER CARE PLANS AFTER MEDICARE. ACTS OF LIFE- SO AGAIN AND PHARMACY AT BILL BOTH ON THE MEDICAL. AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT SIDE HOWEVER SO IT IS. DME I IN THE REMAIN THE RESPONSE TO MAKE CARE PLAY THEY WOULD TO BILL. ON THAT SO WHAT THERE ARE A CHARM. OR A- STUFF WE WANT TO CLEAR THAT. YOU AND A CALORIE. SO THIS WILL INCLUDE OUR CLUB WERE. ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS IN HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY. YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISS COOPER AND- LIKE FOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST. THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR INTO YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HE'S QUITE IN THE WILL CENTER- REIMBURSABLE OVER MEDIC CAL- YOU KNOW I SAID ON THE SAMITY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SEEN HOW ARE OUR LOCAL ARROWHEAD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AND THE BUDGETING CONSTRAINTS THAT HAPPENED- WELL I SAT THERE. AND- COBIT NINETEEN HAS HIT SAMBAR DINO COUNTY PARTICULARLY HARD- SECOND ONLY TO L. A. COUNTY NUMBER OF CASES WE'VE HAD IN OUR COUNTY. AND ARROWHEAD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL THAT SERVES THE DISTRICT HAS TAKEN A LEAD ROLE IN OUR LOCAL RESPONSE EFFORTS INCLUDING WITH TESTING RESPONDING TO THE SURGEON HOSPITALIZATIONS IN ENSURING THAT OUR LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE RECEIVING HIGH QUALITY CARE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHILE DOING ALL THIS- THE SYSTEMS LIKE A R. M. C. ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FRONT FINANCING A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS- EFFORTS. THEY GO ON UNREIMBURSED- AND IN THE REPORT HERE IT TALKS ABOUT. HOW IF I'M READING IT CORRECTLY- FOR MEDIC CAL FFS PATIENTS WHICH COMPRISES ROUGHLY 30% OF PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. HOSPITALIZATION PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS RECEIVE NO STATE GENERAL FUND. SO TO ME THAT MEANS THAT THE GENERAL FUND THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAS TO. MAKE UP FOR THAT THAT THAT DISPARITY THAT'S THERE. AND I'M THINKING THAT WITH THE PREVENT. NINETEEN AND THE BUSINESS IMPACT AT THE LOCAL LEVELS- COUNTIES INCLUDED. THAT HOW HOW REALISTIC IS IT NOW TO CONTINUE TO ASK FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTINUE TO PUT IN FROM THEIR GENERAL FUND. WITHOUT HAVING SOME MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE TO START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AND THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO STARTS TO MOVE THAT DISCUSSION FORWARD- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT- WHEN THERE IS- FEDERAL PORTIONS ONLY COVER ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. DID ANY OF ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR PRESENTATION ANSWERING TO THE PROPOSAL THERE IS- THAT DISPARITY THAT'S THERE BUT GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE'VE ALL SEEN HERE IN THE LAST YEAR AND WHO KNOWS WHAT. THE NEXT YEAR OR EVEN TWO YEARS FROM NOW IS GOING TO BRING US IN THIS REALM OF PANDEMICS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE IMPACT WITH BUSINESS- HAS BEEN SEVERELY HIT WITH BUSINESS AND THEN- THOSE THAT WOULD BY- HOMES FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES ARE GOING TO THE COUNTY LEVEL- IT WAS. A STRETCH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FEELING THAT IN WHEN I SAT ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND NOW KNOWING THE IMPACT THAT'S GOING ON I THINK IT MERITS- SOME TYPE OF DISCUSSION TO START TO TALK ABOUT- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND HOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IS MEETING THAT GAP THAT'S IN THERE ESPECIALLY AGAIN WHEN YOU SEE THAT 30% OF A PUBLIC HEALTH. HOSPITALS RECEIVE NO STATE GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAS TO MAKE UP FOR THAT SO I'M I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHERING THIS DISCUSSION AND WORKING- WITH THOSE TO THE CHAIR. TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE WITH LOCAL INPUT IN HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN A DRESS- THIS UP PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE ALL IN AND CERTAINLY WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE SEE THE CONSTRAINTS GOING ON IT AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. TO THE STATE LEVEL TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT WE HAVE BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND HOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT- IS WEATHERING THROUGH THE STORM. TOGETHER AND COLLECTIVELY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FOR THE DIALOGUE ON THE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROMANCE AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS THIS HAS BEEN A VERY HOT HEALTHY DISCUSSION.

THE CHRONIC UNDER FUNDING OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY THE RAPID RISE OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE RATES THAT WERE ALREADY SKYROCKETING TECH CRISIS LEVEL PRIOR TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE ALREADY INFECTED WITH SYPHILIS CHLAMYDIA OR GONORRHEA TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH HIGHER FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND FIND THAT THE STF AND I MAKE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED FOR FAR TOO LONG HAVE ALREADY MANIFESTED IN VERY ALARMING WAYS- FOR EXAMPLE THE CDC CONFIRMED A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT A NEW ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT STRAIN OF GONORRHEA BEGAN TO SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DURING THE CALL THAT CRISIS AND OUR OWN STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO ISSUED AN ALERT THIS PAST DECEMBER ABOUT THE RISING NUMBER OF DISSEMINATED GONOCOCCAL COMPLICATION OF UNTREATED GONORRHEA THAT SPREADS ACROSS THE BODY THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM. THIS IS LIKELY A RESULT OF PEOPLE NOT IN FCT TESTING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BABIES WERE BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS I'M DURING THE PANDEMIC. OF THE COST OF INACTION IS FAR TOO GREAT TO CONTINUE IGNORING APPROXIMATELY BILLION DOLLARS IS SPENT ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA THING CALIFORNIA ON HEALTH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PD.
