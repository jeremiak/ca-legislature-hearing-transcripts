00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.757
BE MADE UP. A BROAD CROSS

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:46.859

AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE IS MORE

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.551
CRITICAL THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:15.354
AT THE SAME TIME COVERT

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.156
NINETEEN HAS CREATED ENORMOUS

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.992

EQUITY FIRMS THAT DON'T

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.241
NECESSARILY HAVE ANY PRACTICE

IN THE PROVISION MEDICAL CARE.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.179
IT'S SECOND I'M A CRISIS THAT

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:44.183
CREATES AN IMMEDIATE NECESSITY

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.051
TO GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.120

OVER A TRANSACTION INVOLVING A

NONPROFIT ENTITY. SO IN ESSENCE

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.565
THIS BILL SEEKS PARITY THAT THE

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.600
SCRUTINY WE ALREADY APPLY TO

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.470

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:07.740
THAT SCRUTINY TO FOR PROFIT

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:10.776
TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE PURPOSE

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.978
OF PROTECTING PATIENTS OUR

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:16.248
CONSTITUENTS IN A MARKET PLACE

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:20.152
THAT WE DON'T SEEK TO STIFLE.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:24.256
WE SEEK TO REVIEW AND PROTECT.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:26.492
THE GOAL OF PATIENT ACCESS

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:30.262
PATIENT CARE. AND BLOCKING ANTI

COMPETITIVE PRICING MEMBERS I

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.767
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.435
VOTE THANK YOU CENTER MONNING

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.304
MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.506
DEBATE SENATOR BORCHERS. THE

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:43.809
MAN PRESIDENT PHILOSOPHICALLY I

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:45.844
WOULD NORMALLY BE INCLINED TO

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:48.480
PROMOTE- COMPETITION AND BE

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:50.816
CONCERNED ABOUT ANTI TRUST

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:53.352
DEVELOPMENTS- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.753
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.556
IS THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.259
NOT CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.795
ARE CREATING MORE OBSTACLES- IN

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:06.465
THE WAKE OF. THE NEED FOR- MORE

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:09.301
MEDICAL SERVICES IN PARTICULAR

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.769
I THINK ONE THE COMMENTS THAT

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:14.773
THE AUTHOR MENTION IS THAT THE

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.643
NONPROFIT IS SOLD AT A CERTAIN

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.611
LEVEL OF SCRUTINY THAT WOULD

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:22.147
THEN BE APPLIED TO A PRIVATE

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.883
ENTITY. THAT I THINK COULD BE

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.953
PROBLEMATIC- BECAUSE ONE YOU

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.222
HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CONTRACT

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.291
AND THE FREEDOM TO ENGAGE WITH

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.960
ENTITIES WHETHER BEING A PROFIT

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:37.363
SETTING- OR SOME OTHER FIVE

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:38.697
COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE SO

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:39.998
CONCERNS ME THAT WE'RE TAKING

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:41.633
THE PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THAT WOULD

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.001
NORMALLY BE RESERVED FOR

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:45.104
ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE A TAX

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.039
BENEFIT AND THE NONPROFIT

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.742
RECEIVED BENEFITS BY VIRTUE OF

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.443
CLASSIFICATION INTO A PRIVATE

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.445
SITUATION THAT TYPICALLY

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:57.015
DOESN'T. SO IN A COLD SITUATION

00:16:57.082 --> 00:17:00.152
MY CONCERN IS THAT DELAYING

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:03.655
THROUGH IN AG REVIEW PROCESS.

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:05.758
IN AFFILIATION WHEREBY A

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.861
LARGER- MEDICAL AND EIGHTEEN

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:12.131
COULDN'T USE CASH INTO A SMALL

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.332
FOR MEDICAL FACILITY AT THE

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.433
MOMENT OF DESPERATION

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.502
ESPECIALLY AS WE- THE EXISTING

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:19.071
RIGHT NOW I THINK IT COULD

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.639
HAVE. SOME WILDLY INTENDED

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:22.708
CONSEQUENCES EVEN THOUGH I

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:24.943
BELIEVE THE PART OF THE BILL IS

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.346
TO PROMOTE GREATER ACCESS TO

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:28.380
HEALTHCARE BUT IN A CULVERT

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:31.350
SCENARIO I THINK CREATING THAT

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:35.521
BUREAUCRATIC IN ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:38.023
THE WORK THAT OFFICE IN MAYBE

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:38.624
SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.526
BROUGHT BACK ONCE OUR FINANCES

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.795
AND OR PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURES-

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.496
AND SITUATION HAVE IMPROVED

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.565
SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.467
PANDEMIC IS ADDRESSED AND

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.102
RESOLVED HOPEFULLY. THANK YOU

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.878

THE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEARING

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.650

ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE COVERED

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:40.819
UNDER THIS BECAUSE WE REALLY DO

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:45.858
WANT TO FOCUS ON THE TYPES OF-

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:47.826
OF GREGIS IN AND KIND AND

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.995
MONOPOLY. BEHAVIOR THAT AT

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:51.196
LEAST IS AT THE HEART OF THE

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.365
TALKING POINTS THAT THAT- I'VE

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.399

FROM OUR FRIENDS. IN THE CMA.

THINK WHEN THE ISSUES AND IT'S

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.829
A COMPLEX ISSUE. THAT THIS BILL

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.632
IS SEEKING TO ADDRESS AND WHY I

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:43.869
THINK THIS BILL IS SO TIMELY.

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.605
THE TRIGGER FOR THIS BILL IS

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:49.574
ACTUALLY ONE THE- ONE PARTY IS

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.543
ACTUALLY A VERY AS A LARGE

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.245
HEALTH SYSTEM AND I APPRECIATE

00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:58.350
THE AUTHOR MAKING A COMMITMENT

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.485
TO CLARIFYING DATS AND ENSURING

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.654
THAT ONLY THE LARGEST SYSTEMS

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.889
WOULD BE INVOLVED IN TRIGGERING

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:06.525
BUT THINK ABOUT IT. SO WHAT

00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:09.728
DOCTOR HAS SAID IS THAT YOU

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:11.296
ALREADY HAVE TO BE A THREE

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.732
HOSPITAL'S MAIN TO START WITH

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.900
SO IF YOU'RE A TO HOSPITAL

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.368
CHAIN ABOUT THIRD ONE THIS

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:17.636
WOULD NOT TRIGGER ANYTHING

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:20.105
YOU'RE READY THREE HOSPITALS SO

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.640
YOU LOOK AROUND IN YOUR OWN

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:22.407
DISTRICTS AND THINK ME

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:23.842
HOUSEHOLD YOU HAVE AND SOMEONE

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:25.844
ACTUALLY CONTROL READ OF THOSE

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.112
HOSPITALS. WHAT KIND OF MARKET

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:28.613
SIZE TODAY REPRESENT YOUR

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.248
COMMUNITY AT THAT POINT IN TIME

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:32.217
AND THEN- SEEKING TO PERHAPS

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:34.986
PURCHASE A FOURTH. OR TAKE OUR

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:37.556
OUR CONTROL. A YOU KNOW A LARA

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:39.424
AND MEDICAL GROUP OR SOMETHING

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.493
IN IN THAT AREA AND SO WHEN

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.195
THEY HAVE THEIR CONVERSATION

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.098
WITH THE HEALTH PLANS ARE OTHER

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.233
OF ENTITIES. THE AMOUNT OF

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.501
LEVERAGE THAT THEY HAVE IN THAT

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.002
CONVERSATION NOW. THEY SAID

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:52.170
THERE'S A TENSION BETWEEN

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:54.106
CONSOLIDATION WHICH CAN DRIVE

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:57.375
UP PRICES AND ALSO- CAN

00:22:57.442 --> 00:22:59.044
COOPERATION TO TRY TO IMPROVE

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.912
QUALITY SO WHAT THIS BILL

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.581
DOESN'T DO IT DOESN'T SAY YOU

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:04.149
CAN'T ACTUALLY BUY THAT FOURTH

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.884
HOSPITAL AFFILIATE WITH THAT

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.453
MEDICAL PRACTICE BY THAT'S-

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.422
INVENTORY SURGERY CENTER. IT

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:11.223
SAYS IS THAT WHEN YOU HIT THAT

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.924
SIZE. WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:15.260
OVERSIGHT OVER THAT. THE AG'S

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:17.329
GONNA HAVE OVERSIGHT AND

00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:18.797
LOOKING AT THAT AND ANOTHER

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.499
THING I DO WANNA SAY IN.

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:21.466
PERHAPS THE AUTHOR CAN ALSO

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:24.035
CLARIFY THIS IS THAT. YES WE DO

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:26.171
IN CURRENT EXISTING LAW HAVE

00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:27.672
REVIEW WHEN NOT FOR PROFITS AND

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.674
THATIS BASED IS I THINK WAS

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.978
BUSY MENTION. ON A REVIEW-

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.646
BASED ON COMMUNITY BENEFIT

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:35.180
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FOR

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.016
PROFIT. VIEW THAT ASKED IN THIS

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.351
PARTICULAR BILLS ACTUALLY

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:41.286
NARROWER THAN THAT SO IT'S NOT

00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:42.988
SO BROAD THAT- WELL IF YOU

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:43.955
DON'T FEEL COMMUNITY WHAT WOULD

00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:45.724
YOU DO HAVE TO THE NEW IS

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.193
THOUGH IS SHOW THAT SHE OF

BENEFIT TO THE PATIENTS ARE

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:50.962
TAKING CARE OF. SO I KNOW SOME

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.963
PEOPLE HAVE RAISED SOME

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.198
CONCERNS I'VE HEARD SAID WELL

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.133
YOU KNOW THE- AG'S REVIEW OF

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.301
NOT FOR PROFIT SEEMS TO BE A

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.370
LITTLE. YOU KNOW EXTENSIVE AND

00:23:58.436 --> 00:23:59.805
SOMETIMES THEY DEMANDED CERTAIN

00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:01.706
THINGS- FOR COMMUNITIES. IN

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:04.242
FACT IN THIS BILL. THE HEALTH

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.644

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.745

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:08.914
RESOURCES THE SHOW THIS STATE.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.882
THERE THAT DAY. THAT THEY HAVE

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.017
TO SHOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.785
PATIENT BENEFIT TO THIS MERGER

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:16.555
AND THAT'S BEYOND. THE MARKET

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.456
RISK OF ALLOWING THIS

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:19.591
CONSOLIDATION SO WE'RE TRYING

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:21.526
TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE. NOT TO

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.929

WE SEE IS THAT YOU GOT THE

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.514
PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP. THEN

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:43.181
PERHAPS WE SHOULD LET THAT

00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:45.050

NARROW WAIVERS AND THAT THAT

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:16.213
THAT'S THE DESCRIPTION THE IDEA

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.115
BEING WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE IF

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.050

THAT WERE BROUGHT UP ABOUT-

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.719
MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF OUR

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.154
FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE TOOLS

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:59.023
THEY NEED TO FIGHT WHATEVER

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.124
TYPE OF FIRED IS THEY'RE

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:05.062

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.881
OF BUYERS THEY HAVE CONCERNS

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:25.082
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.517
HAVE THAT THEY NEED AND I THINK

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.185
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE.

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:31.655
HOWEVER EIGHT TRADERS KNOW THE

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:32.823
TOOLS THAT THEY NEED FOR

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.124
DONNELLY FOR THE JOB THAT

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.993
THEY'RE DOING IT THEY'RE SAYING

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.229
THAT THIS TYPE OF TOOL IS

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.029
CAUSING THEM HARM THAT I THINK

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:41.999

BID ON FORECLOSED HOMES AHEAD

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:55.145

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.489
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEAL WITH

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:07.924
THE PROBLEM I MENTIONED WE'RE

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.860
HOMES MAY BE LEFT VACANT. IT

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.962
ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

A SCENARIO WHERE A COMMERCIAL

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.831
COMPLEX WITH MIGHT HAVE. IT

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.799
MIGHT BE IT- STRUCTURALLY

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.401
ESSENTIALLY ONE COMPLEX BUT

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:53.336
WITH MULTIPLE A P. ENDS FOR A

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:56.706
MULTI FAMILY. WITH MULTI-

MULTIPLE ATMS. HOW WOULD IT

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:04.114
WORK IN THIS SITUATION. THIS

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:08.485
THIS STATUTE BEFORE US IS. IT'S

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:11.221
TARGETED IN LANGUAGES SPECIFIC

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:13.456

I HAPPEN AND ON. TO KNOW OF THE

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.698
UNITS FOR EXAMPLE AT THAT ARE

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:24.801
IN A COMPLEX INDIVIDUAL LET'S

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.803
SEE TOWN OMES BUT THEY'RE IN A

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.272
COMPLEX WITH MULTIPLE EIGHT PM.

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:37.414
WITH THIS APPLY TO THE. I'M NOT

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.249
SURE EXACTLY HOW TO ANSWER THE

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:43.386
QUESTION IF THE TOWN HOME IS

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.689
UNDER ITS TITLE CONSIDERED A

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.924
SINGLE FAMILY HOME IT COULD

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:54.130
APPLY YES BUT IT WOULD. SO YES

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.700
IN THAT CASE OKAY THANK YOU AND

00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.902
ALSO CONCLUDE TO BUY I THINK

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:03.139
THE AUTHOR. HAS SEIZED ON

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:05.442
SOMETHING THAT IS REAL IN MY

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:07.711
FORMER CAPACITY IS A SUPERVISOR

00:54:07.777 --> 00:54:11.648
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN- MAJOR

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.517
INVESTMENT FIRMS BY UP THESE

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:15.719
THINGS AND- YOU'RE DEALING WITH

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.020
THE BUREAUCRACY OF HOW DO YOU

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.722
GET THEM TO REHABILITATE THE

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.624
PROPERTY AND ESPECIALLY AS

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.392
THEY'RE LOOKING TO FLIP IT SO

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.627
THERE IS A DEFINITE TRUTH TO

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:26.296
THIS- I WOULD. OTHERWISE HOPE

00:54:26.363 --> 00:54:28.765
THOUGH THAT LOCAL CONTROL WOULD

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.200
BE MORE IMPORTANT IN THIS

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:33.336
SITUATION- AND IF THEY WANT TO

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:35.038
IMPOSE GREATER FINES OR IF THEY

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:37.240
WANT TO CREATE RESTRICTIONS- I

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:39.142
THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.276
FLOOD OF FORECLOSED PROPERTIES

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.778
UNFORTUNATELY. I DON'T KNOW IF

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.279
IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE TWO

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:45.315
THOUSAND TENS LEVEL BUT

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:46.850
PANDEMIC WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.318
GOING TO CREATE THESE PROBLEMS

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:49.686
AND COUNTIES ARE GOING TO NEED

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:52.322
TO UNLOAD THEM QUICKLY AND

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.423
RESTRICTIONS THIS COULD CREATE

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.193
A PROBLEM. THAT IS ONLY CAN.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.361
THANK YOU CENTER JUST THE SCENE

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.530

APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING THE

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:06.002
ISSUE ABOUT THE FINES THE FINES%

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:09.539
WHILE THIS STATUTE. DOES ALLOW

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.675
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OR RATHER

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:14.978
IT INCREASES THE CAP. THAT IS

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.380
NOW IN PLACE. IT IS NOT

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:18.982
REQUIRED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.350
TO USE IT IN SO IN THIS RESPECT

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.352
THE COMPLETELY HONORS LOCAL

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.887
CONTROL. SO IF A LOCAL

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:26.256
GOVERNMENT CHOOSES NOT TO LET

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:27.724
ME FIND AT ALL THAT IS UP TO

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.092
THEM OR IF THEY CHOOSE TO

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:31.227
FOLLOW. THE FORMER FINDS THAT

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.697
THEY HAD BEEN UTILIZING THAT IS

00:55:33.763 --> 00:55:35.532
ALSO UP TO THEM. THIS IS JUST

01:04:58.127 --> 01:05:00.963
DUPLEX AND- THEY RENT THOSE OUT

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.198
FOR THEIR RETIREMENT IT'S

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.267
THEIR- KIDS COLLEGE FUND SO

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.935
THESE ARE NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE SO

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.370
WE TOOK THAT IN MIND MAKING

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.273
SURE THAT WE PROTECT PROTECTED

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:12.074
THEM. AS WELL AS A TENANT. WE

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.876
HAVE TALKED TO CONSTITUENTS AS-

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.077
MY COLLEAGUES STATED FROM

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.446
SALINAS IS IN THIS IS. I ISSUE

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.782
THAT REQUIRES A STACK NOW. AND

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.450
THIS BILL IS JUST ONE OF MANY

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:24.086
RESPONSES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.755

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.392
PROGRAM WILL STAY IN THEIR

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.661
HOMES AND THEY WILL REPAY THE

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.663
GRANT IN TIME. LANDLORDS TO

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.064

MAKING THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS.

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.740
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:47.810
NOT AN EXCUSE FOR TENANTS TO

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:50.313
PAY THEIR RENT. WE HOPE IT'S AN

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:52.281
INCENTIVE FOR THE- TENANT TO

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:54.016
PAY THEIR RENT BECAUSE ZERO.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.852
SAFEGUARDS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.154
LOOK OUT AFTER THOSE WONDERFUL

TENANTS AND THOSE VULNERABLE

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:02.258
LANDLORDS- THEY MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:02.825

FOLKS WITHOUT A PATH. OUT OF

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.939
THIS CRISIS. SOME OF MY

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.607
COLLEAGUES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.975

CAUCUS PUT TOGETHER.

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.241
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OUR WE

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.511
TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS.

EMPHASIZE IT HAS BEEN SEVEN I

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:47.296
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.231
HEAR. THIS BILL IS NOT A

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:51.200
GIVEAWAY TENANTS ARE STILL

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:53.102
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING RENT AND

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.737
LANDLORDS WILL LIKELY GET A

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.206
HAIR CUT. BUT IT DOES PROVIDE

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:58.607
SOME TEMPORARY RELIEF TO ALL

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.509
THE PARTIES. YOU KNOW I LIKE IN

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.912
THE STATE ARE TRYING HARD TO

FLATTEN THE COAT. FOR IT AS IT

01:08:07.516 --> 01:08:08.484

MAYBE HANDLE A LITTLE BIT

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.195
BETTER THAN HAVING NO SOLUTION.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.563
AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.264
TRY TO FIGURE OUT CREATIVELY

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:25.167
HOW TO DO THESE THINGS. ARE TWO

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:27.736
CALLS AS LITTLE HARM AS

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.071

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.809

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.744
HELP HURTING CALIFORNIANS

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:38.247

NOT ENTIRELY BUT PARTICULARLY

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:43.352
THE SMALLER LANDLORDS WHO ARE

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.553
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.990

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.425
I'M SURE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.260
HURTING PEOPLE AS WELL THESE

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.529

GOOD FAITH TOGETHER TO FIND

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:16.719

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.304
GOVERNMENT TO FIND WITH INTO

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:37.673
THAT IS MORE WORK- THAT IS

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.176
NEEDED ON THIS BILL- WE DO FACE

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:45.080
A HUGE RISK OF MASS PROTECTIONS

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.282
FOR NOT JUST AFFECTIONS THE

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.384
PEOPLES OF LEAVING I GOT A TEXT

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.185
THIS MORNING FROM A SMALL

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:50.686
LANDLORD I KNOW AND SAN

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:53.455
FRANCISCO IN FOUR EIGHT THAT

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.358
SEVEN OF HIS EIGHTEEN TENANTS.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.760
HAVE SIMPLY VACATED. NOT

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:58.794
BECAUSE THEY WERE DYING TO

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:01.130
VACATE BUT THEY HAD NO WAY OF

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.731
PAYING THE RENT. AND SOMEONE

01:10:02.798 --> 01:10:05.367
TENANTS CAN PAY THE RENT AND

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:07.536
EITHER ADDICTED OR LEAVE. THAT

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.071
IS TERRIBLE FOR THE TENANTS

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.839
IT'S TERRIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:11.807
AS A RESIDENTS OF OUR

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.475
COMMUNITY. AND IT'S BAD FOR THE

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:15.344
LANDLORDS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.580
TO STRUGGLE TO RE RENT A PLACE

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.148
IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US.

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.382
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.651
STABILIZE RENTERS IN THEIR

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.187
HOMES. OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:27.389
TO STRUGGLE TO RECOVER. WITH

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.425
RESPECT TO SB FOURTEEN AND I AM

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.392
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.227
CREATIVE THINKING AND WE DO

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.063
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:36.565
KEEPING ALL PARTIES NEEDS AN

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.868
ACCOUNT BUT I WANTED TO POINT

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.170
OUT A FEW THINGS AND I HOPE

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:42.972
THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE TO WORK

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:44.540
ON THESE ISSUES FIRST OF ALL

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:46.976
THIS IS VOLUNTARY IF THE

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:47.509
LANDLORD DOESN'T WANT TO

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:51.513
PARTICIPATE. PAN THE BILL

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.682
DOESN'T GET TRIGGERED AND SO

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:54.717
THERE WILL BE RENTS. ARE NOT

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.619
PROGRAM WHO NEED FOR TIME AND

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:57.886
THAT CAN BE DONE THIS THROUGH

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.355
AMENDMENTS THEY'RE ALSO SEVERAL

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.924

REPAYMENT BY THE RENTERS. FIVE

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.234
TO BE CLEAR WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:15.371
DO THERE IS A SLIDING SCALE SO

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:15.871
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LOWER

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.374
INCOME. AND HAVE PART FOR ALL

THEIR- RENT OWED TO THE STATE

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.811
WAVED AND THAT IS VERY

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.146
IMPORTANT I'M APPRECIATIVE OF

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.181
THE AUTHORS HAVE PUT THAT INTO

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.117
THE BILL. ON HOWEVER THE

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:29.918
MECHANISM TO REPAY IT'S OVER

ISSUE OF PAYMENT OF RENT

WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING THAT

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:21.530
SIZE IS GLAD TO SEE THIS. I WAS

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:24.399

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:33.542
CREDIT ITEM AND I UNDERSTAND

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:38.280
FOR MEETING. HERE THE ANALYSIS

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:40.282
THE BILL DIRECTS THE FTP TO

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:43.351
COLLECT- ANY UNPAID AMOUNTS

SIMILAR TO OTHER TAX DEBTS

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.390
INCLUDING LEANS AND LEVEES SO

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.459
SINCE THAT IT FALLS UNDER THAT

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.462
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.796
THIS POOR PEOPLE FOR THE MOST

01:18:54.863 --> 01:18:57.999
PART YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF COLOR-

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.901
MAYBE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.937
SERVICES BUT HOW DO THEY DEAL

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:04.339
WITH THIS SORT OF DEBT RELIEF

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.775
FOLLOWING THEM IN A NEGATIVE

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:09.744
WAY VERSES. THIS IS OPPORTUNITY

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.847
GOOD STATE TO IN THE STATE AND

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.516
THE TENANT I DON'T KNOW I WANT

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:17.252
TO HEAR AN ANSWER. AND

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.855
EXCELLENT QUESTION SO- LET'S

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:22.524
ASSUME THAT THE TENANT- OWES

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:26.795
RENT. AND TO THE LANDLORD. AND

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.730
THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY TO BE

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.832
ABLE TO PAY THAT BACK RIGHT

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.468
AWAY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:34.336
MAKE ENOUGH MONEY OR THEY'RE

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.638
NOT WORKING THAT DEBT WILL

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:38.974
FOLLOW THEM FOR EVER IF THEY

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.943
EVENTUALLY LEAVE OR IF THE-

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.646
THE- THEY DON'T TO ENTER INTO

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.748
THIS AGREEMENT. THEY WILL HAVE

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:49.351
A HARD TIME FINDING ANOTHER

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.119
APARTMENT BECAUSE THAT THAT

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:53.255
WILL FOLLOW THEM. SO WITH THIS

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.457
PROCESS ENVISIONS IS IF THEY

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.992
PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.927
AGREEMENT THE DEBT THEN BE

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.962
BECOMES A DEBT OF THE STATE.

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:04.166
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS IF THE

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:07.502
INDIVIDUAL IS EARNING A HUNDRED

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:10.005
AND 50% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.806
YEAH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEN

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:12.908
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO START

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:15.343
PAYING THAT DEBT BACK. AND THE

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.179
F. T. B. WELL COLLECTED JUST

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.147
LIKE ANY OTHER DEBT THAT'S

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:22.150
BOWED TO FTP. WHICH MEANS IT'S

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.219
A PAYMENT PLAN RIGHT. IF THEY

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.588
EARN BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND A

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.323
HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE PERCENT.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:31.927
BEN IT'S A 75% REPAYMENT AND

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.329
AGAIN IT'S OVER TEN YEARS. AND

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.531
IT'S WITH NO INTEREST AND THERE

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.600
SO THERE'S NO PENALTIES ON IT

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.535
AT THAT POINT. IF THEY EARN

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:43.271
BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND NINETY

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:46.441
NINE PERCENT. THEN THEY PAY 50%

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:52.714
AND IF THEY. EARN 75% OR BELOW

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.683
THERE'S NO REPAYMENT BUT THIS

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.484
DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY'RE EARNING

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:59.821
AT THE YEAR THAT THE OBLIGATION

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:02.190
TO PAY START. SO TO BE REALLY

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:05.427
FRANK ABOUT IT. IT'S PROBABLY

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:06.861
MORE PROBABLE THAT THE POOREST

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.830
PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE HARDEST

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.833
TIME MAKING THE RENT PAYMENTS.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.536
AND THAT'S WHO WILL END UP IN

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.204
THE PROGRAM AND WHOSE DEATH

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.573
WILL BE FORGIVEN. IF THEY'RE

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.842
STILL NOT EARNING. THE MEDIAN

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:24.212
INCOME. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:28.883
OKAY SO IT IS AN INVESTMENT BY

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:29.517

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.920

HOUSING MARKET SO THAT PEOPLE

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.492

RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:44.933
IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO END UP

TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:44.219
QUITE FRANKLY- THIS IS A

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:47.021
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NEITHER PARTY

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:50.125
NEEDS. TO AGREE TO IT. BUT THE

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:53.528
A BY SOME CONDITIONS FOLLOW

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:56.564
FROM IT THE- GOVERNOR HAS

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.133
ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:01.002
WHICH- PROVIDES THAT EVICTIONS

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.103
CANNOT OCCUR DURING THIS

01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.972
PANDEMIC IN ITS WITHIN HIS

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:06.074
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- THE

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.342
JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS ALSO

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.044
WEIGHED IN AND HAS SAID- NOT

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.880
ONLY CAN YOU NOT A VICTORY IN

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:14.249
THE TIME ON. THAT IS THAT IT'S

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:15.517
BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE GOVERNOR

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:17.652
AND HE IS EXTENDED BY THE WAY I

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:20.555
BELIEVE THE END OF JULY. BUT IT

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:22.791
AFTER AFTER THAT THEY WILL NOT

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.894
BE TAKING. AT THE PAY WORK FOR

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.828
EVICTIONS AND SO WE HAVE A

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:29.731
SITUATION WHERE- BECAUSE OF THE

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:32.066
AUTHORITY. THAT IS GIVEN TO THE

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:34.969
GOVERNOR DURING. A PANDEMIC. ON

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:38.640
THOSE. THAT SITUATION IS IN

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:39.808
PLACE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.409
TRYING TO DO IS TO COME IN AND

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:43.178
TO SAY SO WHEN THAT ALL IS

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:46.147
DONE. WHEN IT'S FINISHED WITH.

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.382
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:50.318
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE.

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:54.322
THOUSANDS OF SMALL. LANDLORDS

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.123
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING FULL

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:58.393
PAYMENTS. AND THAT ARE AT RISK

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.229
OF FORECLOSURE AND MAY LOSE.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.965
THERE ARE THEIR PROPERTIES AND

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.301
THOUSANDS OF TENANTS HUNDREDS

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:08.002
OF THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO

01:25:08.069 --> 01:25:12.841
WOULD BE. AT RISK OF EVICTION

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.976
AND IF THAT HAPPENS WOULD HAVE

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:16.544
A REALLY HARD TIME FINDING A

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:17.412
LANDLORD TO RENT TO THEM

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:18.880
BECAUSE THEY JUST GOT EVICTED

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.448
AND SO THEN YOU KNOW THEY DON'T

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:21.883
THEY THEY DIDN'T PAY THE RENT

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.818
SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SETS UP

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:26.855
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LANDLORD

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:29.724
AND THE TENANT. TO VOTE BOTH

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.092
VOLUNTARILY AGREE THAT THIS IS

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.528
A PROCESS THAT THEY WANT TO GET

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:37.532
INVOLVED IN AND THEY

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:39.934
VOLUNTARILY. THROUGH THE RACKS.

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:41.903
ASIAN CONDITION. TRUCKS A DAY

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.072
BEEN INVOLVED IN. SO THAT'S THE

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:47.075
THAT'S THE CONSTITUTIONAL. MY%

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.743
VERY SIMPLE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.380
ANALYSIS- THEN AND THEN THE

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:54.182
SECOND ONE IS THE PROSPECTS TO

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.451
EXCHANGE THE TAX CREDITS. THAT

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.219
THAT WERE WORKING ON BUT WE

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:00.455
HAVE BEEN TOLD BY. THE

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.023
FINANCIAL EXPERTS AND WILL

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:04.626
CONTINUE TO PROBE THIS QUITE

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.194
FRANKLY BECAUSE THIS IS KEY TO

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.129
THE WHOLE. THING WORKING IS

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.265
THAT THOSE TAX CREDITS HAVE

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.133
MONETARY VALUE NOW YOU MAY NOT

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.434
BE ABLE TO GET A DOLLAR FOR

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.737
DOLLAR IF YOU SELL IT THE

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:16.771
MARKET TODAY. BUT IT WILL HAVE

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:20.909
MORE. VALUE TO YOU- AT. RIGHT

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.277
NOW IF YOU NEED IT TO BE ABLE

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.478
TO MAKE YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:26.915
OR TO PAY. DEBTS THAT YOU HAD-

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:32.020
AND IF YOU HOLD ON TO IT VALUE

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.922
INCREASES OVER. SO LET BE ABLE

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.023
TO MAKE TAT TO FOR THEM WITH

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.324
THEY NEED CASH RIGHT NOW OR

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:41.129
WHETHER THEY- THEY- WANT TO

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:41.663
SAVE IT AND USE IT IN THE

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:44.299
FUTURE. THANK YOU ARE ON MY OWN

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.433
TIME AND PRESENT SO I DO

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.368
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:47.969
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PROCESS

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.705
WITH THE- ANTI TAX BUT HAS NOT

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:51.906
BEEN COMPLETELY IRONED OUT AND

01:26:51.973 --> 01:26:54.075
THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT-

01:26:54.142 --> 01:26:55.143
AND THEN REGARDING THE

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:57.979
VOLUNTARY- WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.381
TIMES. IN ANSWERS EVEN- SOME OF

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:01.683
THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ARE GOOD

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.484
CALLING YOU- FROM AT LOS

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.286
ANGELES WAS ASKING. IN THE%

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:06.120
ANSWER WERE HEARING THAT IT'S

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:07.155
VOLUNTARY BUT WE'RE ALSO

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.456
HEARING AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:10.625
IT'S- REALLY THE VOLUNTARY IS

CAN VOLUNTEER FOR PROGRAM. AND

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.300
THEN THE AMERICAN SAY YES OR NO

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:21.436
THEY'RE GONNA VOLUNTEER. BUT

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:23.338
EVEN IF THE LANDLORD DOESN'T

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:25.373
VOLUNTEER UNLAWFUL DETAINER IS

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.142
TO RESTRICT. SO THE LANDLORD

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:31.245
REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A VOLUNTARY

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:34.749
SITUATION HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:36.484

PROBLEM RANGERS CAN'T PAY RENT.

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:50.465
AND BUT IT'S CAUSED BY THE-

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:53.301
POLICIES THAT THIS GOVERNMENT

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:55.803
LAID OUT IN MARCH. THAT TOO

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:56.704
BECAUSE IT IS IT IT'S A

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.607
TEMPORARY IT'S A TEMPORARY

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.676
CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS.

MEANING THE ECONOMY IS COMING

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:05.380
BACK SLOWLY BUT IT IS COMING

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:08.216
BACK EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.585
WORKERS ARE GOING BACK TO WORK.

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:12.620
THEY'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT UP

TO DEAL IN THAT MARKET THAT

REALLY THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.136
NOT STOPPED PAYING RENT-

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:30.271
COMPLETELY SOME HAVE REDUCE

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:31.639
THEIR ABILITY TO PAY RENT BUT

MARKET. AND THE AND THE

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.712
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

LANDLORD AND THE TENANT IN

THOSE CASES CAN MAKE UP THERE

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.717
ALL IN ALL IN MOST OF THE

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.686
CASES. THE LANDLORD AND THE

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:45.987
TENANT ARE GONNA BE ABLE WORK

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.922

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:02.970
PROBABLY SOMETHING WE'VE NOT

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.205
SEEN CERTAINLY HERE IN

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.873

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:12.213
CONVOLUTED. AS WE'RE ALREADY

THE NEXT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:50.418
YEARS- TRYING TO SOLVE IT. AS

HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE AT THE END

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.248
OF THIS CRISIS AS MY GOOD

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.450
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO-

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.552
POSITS BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.721
YOU BUT IN LOOKING AT THE DAILY

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.356
NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:30.691
CALIFORNIA THE NOTION THAT WE

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:34.061
ARE OVER THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS.

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:35.429
THIS PROBLEM IS GOING TO

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:40.434
CONTINUE UNTIL WE HAVE A CURE.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:44.172
A TREATMENT OR VACCINE NONE OF

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:46.174
WHICH SEEM TO BE ON THE HORIZON

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.942
SO AN ISSUE LIKE THIS ACTUALLY

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:50.845
DOES HAVE VALUE AND I WANT TO

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.847
THANK THOSE WHO PUT TOGETHER

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:55.950
THIS VERY UNUSUAL AND I THINK

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:58.619
ELEGANT SOLUTION. I DO HAVE

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:00.488
CONCERNS THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS A

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.957
NEW CONCEPT THE NOTION OFGOING

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:05.259
TILL TWENTY THIRTY FIVE I THINK

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.962
IS AN LEASE FOR ME. A DEAL

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:09.363
BREAKER GOING FORWARD I THINK

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.566
THAT'S WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:14.669
TIME SO MUCH CAN HAPPEN- BUT I

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.504
DO THINK THAT WE ARE ON THE

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.639
RIGHT PATH. AND SO I WILL

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:23.177
SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TODAY- I DO

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:25.046
THINK WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.648
ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSPIRING WE'RE

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:29.050
ALL HOPING THE FEDERAL

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:32.153
GOVERNMENT'S GONNA STEP UP WITH

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.487
CARES TO WORST MOTHER. GRAHAM

01:31:33.554 --> 01:31:35.356
BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.992
MONEY HERE AND PEOPLE ARE MAYBE

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:40.528
GO TO SUMMER GOING BACK TO WORK

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.129
BUT IF THIS TREND CONTINUES

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:44.599
HEARING CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD BE

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:47.668
MY- THAT WE WILL PULL BACK.

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.704
BECAUSE OUR NUMBER. PEOPLE WHO

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:52.139
ARE NOW INFECTED AND ARE GOING

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.408
TO THE HOSPITAL IN A REAL NICE

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:57.078
TO YOU AND ARE POTENTIALLY-

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.980
THREATENED WITH THEIR LIVES IS

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:03.818
INCREASING. DRAMATICALLY AND SO

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:04.785
TO THINK THAT WE ARE AT THE END

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:08.089
OF THIS IS TRUST ABSOLUTELY

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:10.124
MIND BOGGLING TO ME. AND I

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.059
THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TRY

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.427
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN KEEP

01:32:13.494 --> 01:32:15.496
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. AND AT

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.599
THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZED ARE A

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:21.202
LOT OF LANDLORDS OUT THERE. WHO

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:23.337
ARE NOT BIG LANDLORDS THEY'RE

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:27.308
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OWN A DUPLEX

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:27.875
OR INHERITED SOMETHING THAT

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:30.344
THEY NOW RENT OUT AND I HAVEN'T

01:32:30.411 --> 01:32:31.646
HEARD YET A DISCUSSION THAT

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:33.347
SHOWS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:34.582
ANY KIND OF MORTGAGE

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:36.951
FORBEARANCE BECAUSE THAT'S SORT

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:43.190
OF THE OTHER PART OF THIS.

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:45.359
MORTGAGES ARE UNDER FEDERAL

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:47.328
CONTROL AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:49.897
MUCH MOVEMENT THERE. BUT I DO

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:53.100
WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS FOR

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.403
THIS THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.672
BUT ALSO MY CONCERN GRANTED

01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:00.241
IT'S A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. BUT

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:02.143
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ON BOTH

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:04.245
SIDES WHEN THIS PANDEMIC IS

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:07.048
GOING TO END WE DO NOT KNOW IT

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.950
IS BLOWING UP IN OUR FACES HERE

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:10.885
IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.386
OF THE STATE. BUT WE WANT

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.088
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO STOP THEIR

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:16.624
HOME SO I COMMEND THE F. I LOOK

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:19.427
FORWARD TO SEEING. THIS MOVIE

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:20.494
GOING FORWARD BUT WANT TO BE

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:23.230
VERY CAUTIOUS- IN IN

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:27.068
EXPECTATIONS- THAT THERE'S A

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:27.902
SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.770
PROBLEM. THANK YOU A MAN

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:32.340
PRESENT THANK YOU CENTER

JACKSON CENTER BORDERS. THANK

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.477
YOU I AGREE WITH. MY COLLEAGUE

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:40.514
FROM. SANTA BARBARA THAT THERE

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.950
ARE THREE PARTIES IN THAT A

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.518
PART OF THIS DYNAMIC GET YOUR

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:46.287
RENTER'S YOUR LANDLORDS HERE

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:48.823
LENDERS. THIS IS DEALING

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:51.025
PRINCIPALLY WITH THE FIRST

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:53.160
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE SECOND.

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.563
NOT BE ABLE TO AT THIS POINT

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.465
ADDRESSED THE THIRD. A

01:33:57.531 --> 01:33:59.100
PRACTICAL STANDPOINT I'M TRYING

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:02.803
TO WALK THROUGH THIS SO. WE

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.740
HAVE A LANDLORD. WHO HAS

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:06.340
TENANTS IN THE TENANTS ARE NOT

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:09.276
PAYING. SALANDER MUST FRONT

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:12.613
LOAD THE VALUE OF THE RENT TO

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.582
SATISFY HIS OR HER NOTE. I

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:15.182
THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:19.186
THAT. THE CREDIT WOULD NOT BE

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:22.256
ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS.

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:25.359
AND PRESUMABLY THE LANDLORD

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:27.228
WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO ACHIEVE

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:29.830
THE TAX CREDIT UPON THE TAX

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.866
RELEVANT TAX FILING PERIOD

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:34.969
LET'S JUST SAY APRIL. SO THE

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:37.471
LANDLORD CONCEIVABLY COULD BE

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:39.540
FRONT LOADING THE FULL VALUE

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:42.376
OF. THE RENT FOR THE PERIOD OF

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:45.112
TIME AND UNTIL THE CREDIT IS

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:47.948
ISSUED. AND THEN WE MOVE INTO

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:51.152
THE CREDIT SCENARIO WHERE IT

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.586
NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT DOLLAR FOR

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:54.789
DOLLAR BUT IF THE LANDLORD THEN

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:56.690
WANTS TO FLOATED. BACK CREDIT

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:59.860
ON THE MARKET TREATED AS PAPER

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.729
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE.

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.798
WHOEVER Y PURCHASE IT. IS

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.300
GOING TO WANT A PROFIT SO LET'S

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.134
SAY IT'S TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:09.403
CREDIT. IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.071
FLOOD ON THE MARKET FOR

01:35:10.137 --> 01:35:12.206
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:13.474
FOR SOMEONE TO WANT TO BUY IT.

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:16.911
SO THE LAND IS LOSING THE RENT

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.979
FOR A YEAR NOT ALL AND NOT ON A

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:20.681
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS IS

01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:22.616
GETTING A CREDIT AND WHEN THEY

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.185
FLOATED ON THE MARKET. THEY'RE

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:25.152
GONNA AT THE PLATE PAY A

01:35:25.219 --> 01:35:28.422
PREMIUM FOR TO BE PURCHASED.

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.357
ARE THESE REASONABLE

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.126
REPRESENTATIONS OF THIS DYNAMIC

01:35:32.193 --> 01:35:34.228

WITHDRAW THAT I THINK THE I

NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AM I

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:42.870
GUESS AND MY QUESTION TO THE

ABLE TO GET THE SPECIFICS ON

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:51.545
HOW EXACTLY DOES WORKS THAT. IS

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:53.814
IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE ON

SOME PARTS OF IT WRONG THIS IS

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.359
A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR CREDIT.

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.956
PLAN TO FIGHT AS WHOLE BUT- THE

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:38.325
STATE THAT ALL. THE REASON WHY

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:40.093

BEEN ONE OR TWO PROJECTS WITHIN

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.577
THOSE JURISDICTIONS. THE

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:53.480

TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:07.060

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:09.763
BUILDING THEIR PROJECT ONLY

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:10.564
WITH MARKET RATE UNITS. THE

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:13.033
PURPOSE OF SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.068
IS TO IMPROVE OUR DENSITY BONUS

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:17.170
LAW SO THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:19.573

RENTAL OR PURCHASE UNITS IN

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:45.565
THAT AREA ART MIGHT. IT ALSO

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:47.968
INCREASES THE ALLOWABLE DENSITY

01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:49.870
BONUS FOR THE VERY LOW INCOME

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:53.173

THE DENSITY BONUS. IT DOES NOT

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.986

THAT'S GOING TO DOUBLE COUNTY.

01:47:19.299 --> 01:47:21.234

THEY'LL BACK UP AGAINST A

CREEK. ALL OF THIS COULD NOT

02:32:43.521 --> 02:32:45.489
GET INSURANCE RENEWAL FOR HOME

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:47.258
AND OUR PROPERTY THIS YEAR.

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:48.492
BECAUSE OF THE POOR POLICIES

02:32:48.559 --> 02:32:50.761
PASSED OUT OF THIS BODY- AND

02:32:50.828 --> 02:32:51.962
NOT TO MENTION THE PEOPLE WHO

NOT ANY INSURANCE AVAILABLE. I

02:33:07.945 --> 02:33:08.879
THINK THAT INSURANCE THAT

02:33:08.946 --> 02:33:10.147
ALLOWS YOU TO GET THE STATE IS

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:11.815
AFFORDABLE THERE'S NO WAY IT'S

02:33:11.882 --> 02:33:13.584
AFFORDABLE AND THAT WAS A

02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:15.252
SUBSTITUTION POLICY THAT YOU

02:33:15.319 --> 02:33:16.120

WITH RANCH PROPERTY HORSES.

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:30.401

02:33:48.752 --> 02:33:49.320
REALLY STRUGGLING TO PAY THAT

02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:50.254
INTO COSTS. WHAT'S REALLY SO

02:33:50.321 --> 02:33:50.888
ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.556
A SO. TO ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS

02:33:52.623 --> 02:33:55.159
THAT RULE AMERICA IS FACING NOW

02:33:55.225 --> 02:33:56.160

MOST OF THESE- CITY AREAS BUT

02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:05.035
THAT'S ALSO- BEEN PROVEN

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:06.937
BECAUSE OF THIS CHO SITUATION

02:34:07.004 --> 02:34:08.639
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT VERY SAFE

02:34:08.706 --> 02:34:11.875
WE LIVE. AT ALL SO I WOULD JUST

02:34:11.942 --> 02:34:14.078
ASK AUTHOR HE WOULD RECONSIDER

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:15.546
AND JUST REALLY ADDRESS THIS-

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:18.082
ISSUE IT IS NOT THE INSURERS

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:20.284
PROBLEM INSURERS RIGHT POLICIES

02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:22.953

INCREASE THE COST OF POLICIES

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:32.563
AND SO POLICIES LIKE THIS THE

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:35.332
INTEREST WILD- OR BY RATES LIKE

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:36.600

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:40.437

IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN

02:45:18.708 --> 02:45:20.243
WE SEE AN IMPERFECTION IN THE

02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:22.312
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO

WE KNOW OUR SYSTEM IS NOT

02:45:25.682 --> 02:45:27.717
PERFECT. BUT HERE'S A PROBLEM

02:45:27.784 --> 02:45:29.786
THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:30.353

CASE CALLED BRADY VERSUS

02:45:35.959 --> 02:45:38.328
MARYLAND. THE US SUPREME COURT

02:45:38.395 --> 02:45:40.063
SAID THAT A DEFENDANT. HAS A

02:45:40.130 --> 02:45:43.566
RIGHT TO KNOW. INFORMATION AS

02:45:43.633 --> 02:45:45.635
TO A TESTIFYING OFFICER THAT

02:45:45.702 --> 02:45:46.870
MAY IMPEACH HIS OR HER

02:45:46.936 --> 02:45:49.339
TESTIMONY SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF AN

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:50.707
OFFICER HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:52.842
PERSONNEL FILE THAT SAYS THEY

02:45:52.909 --> 02:45:55.178
FILED A FALSE REPORT. THEN

02:45:55.245 --> 02:45:57.080
DEFENSE COUNSEL AND DEFENDANT

02:45:57.147 --> 02:45:59.549
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. WELL

02:45:59.616 --> 02:46:02.285
THAT'S BEEN THE LAW SINCE

02:46:02.352 --> 02:46:02.852
NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND THE

02:46:02.919 --> 02:46:04.654
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

02:46:04.721 --> 02:46:06.856
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE

02:46:06.923 --> 02:46:09.959
REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY OFFICERS

02:46:10.026 --> 02:46:12.595
BY NAME BADGE NUMBER. WHO HAVE

02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:13.963
SOMETHING IN THEIR FILE THAT

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:17.133
MAY INDICATE THAT A DEFENSE

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:19.302
COUNSEL OR DEFENDANT MAY WISH

02:46:19.369 --> 02:46:20.370
TO USE IT IN TERMS OF

02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:21.805
IMPEACHMENT ON CROSS

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:23.606
EXAMINATION FOR OTHER PURPOSES

02:46:23.673 --> 02:46:25.308
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO. A LAW

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:27.877
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DOESN'T

02:46:27.944 --> 02:46:29.979
COMPILE THIS INFORMATION. AND

02:46:30.046 --> 02:46:31.014
DOESN'T ALERT THE DISTRICT

02:46:31.081 --> 02:46:33.016
ATTORNEY AS THE NAMES IN BATCH

02:46:33.083 --> 02:46:35.652
NUMBERS THEN THAT INFORMATION

02:46:35.719 --> 02:46:36.686
IS NOT COMMUNICATED TO THE

02:46:36.753 --> 02:46:39.522
DEFENSE AND THE RESULT IS THAT

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:40.990
THE DEFENDANT MAY NOT KNOW IT.

02:46:41.057 --> 02:46:42.559
THE DEFENDANT MAY NOT KNOW IT

02:46:42.625 --> 02:46:43.159
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THAT

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.828
INFORMATION. IN THEIR OWN

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:46.863
DEFENSE. NOW DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:48.431
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FAIRNESS OF

02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:51.801
COURSE AND JUSTICE OF COURSE.

02:46:51.868 --> 02:46:53.403
BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS IT THAT

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:54.070
INFORMATION COMES TO LIGHT

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.172
LATER ON. THE DEFENDANT MAY

02:46:56.239 --> 02:46:57.374
HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE ANOTHER

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.376
TRIAL BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:02.345
TRIAL. WASN'T FAIR THEY DIDN'T

02:47:02.412 --> 02:47:02.946
HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS

02:47:03.012 --> 02:47:05.248

02:47:05.315 --> 02:47:06.449
DOES IT SAYS LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:07.851

ASK A JUDGE TO LOOK OVER THAT

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:20.230
PERSONNEL FILE TO SEE. WHETHER

THAT ARE SET IN SAN FRANCISCO.

03:22:20.795 --> 03:22:22.196
NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN ARVIN

03:22:23.998 --> 03:22:25.399

03:22:45.553 --> 03:22:46.621
SETTING PREVAILING WAGES FOR

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:48.389

WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS

03:22:49.423 --> 03:22:51.659
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. THAN WHERE

THE WAGES ARE SET IN SAN

03:22:53.194 --> 03:22:54.328

03:22:57.698 --> 03:22:59.600
STRUGGLING BUDGET A REDUCTION

03:22:59.667 --> 03:23:01.536
IN A WORK FORCE BECAUSE OF KOBE

03:23:01.602 --> 03:23:03.337
AND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

03:23:03.404 --> 03:23:06.173
AND TO SET. THE WAGES FOR THESE

03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:07.808
PROJECTS. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND

03:23:07.875 --> 03:23:09.544
REQUIRE THOSE WAGES BE PAID IN

03:23:09.610 --> 03:23:11.746
THE SMALL COMMUNITIES THEY DO

03:23:11.812 --> 03:23:13.314
NOT HAVE THE COST OF LIVING

03:23:13.381 --> 03:23:15.049
LIKE THESE MAJOR METROPOLISES.

03:23:15.116 --> 03:23:17.018
WHERE THE WAGES ARE SET IS JUST

03:23:17.084 --> 03:23:19.387
UNACCEPTABLE A COMPLETE WASTE

03:23:19.453 --> 03:23:21.822
OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IF A

03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.797
WHICH WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD

03:23:29.864 --> 03:23:31.866

DURING THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT

03:28:27.561 --> 03:28:29.263

03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:58.225
WHAT'S GRAVITATED OUT OF THE

03:28:58.292 --> 03:29:00.227
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM NOW HAS

03:29:00.294 --> 03:29:02.096

REHABILITATION. AND ARE COUNTY

REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES. WHEN

THAT THE SOME OF THEM. ARE NOT

GOING TO GET ANY BETTER NO

03:29:52.146 --> 03:29:55.149
MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IN THIS

03:29:55.215 --> 03:29:57.184
REMOVES SOME AUTHORITY I THINK

03:29:57.251 --> 03:29:58.585
FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

03:29:58.652 --> 03:30:00.654

MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM

03:30:20.574 --> 03:30:22.476
IS OBSERVATION THAT WE DON'T

03:30:22.543 --> 03:30:24.511
HAVE THE RESOURCES WHAT WE

03:30:24.578 --> 03:30:26.580
DON'T HAVE IS THE WILL. AND I

03:30:26.647 --> 03:30:28.082
THINK THAT'S CRITICAL WE REALLY

03:30:28.148 --> 03:30:30.517
NEED TO TURN THIS WHOLE PROCESS

03:30:30.584 --> 03:30:35.522
AROUND. SO THAT WE CAN. TRY TO

03:30:35.589 --> 03:30:38.859
REHABILITATE AND TO SUPPORT OUR

03:30:38.926 --> 03:30:42.863
YOUTH I AS THEY EXPERIENCE THE

03:30:42.930 --> 03:30:45.199
UPS AND DOWNS IN THE VAGARIES

03:30:45.265 --> 03:30:48.002
OF THEIR LIVES. ARE CHALLENGES

03:30:48.068 --> 03:30:50.270

03:30:52.439 --> 03:30:54.575
JOSH AS WE GO FORWARD IN

OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:30:58.545 --> 03:30:59.913
THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE

03:30:59.980 --> 03:31:02.683
IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION AND

03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:05.352
INTERVENTION IN REHABILITATION

03:31:05.419 --> 03:31:07.654
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SIMPLE

03:31:07.721 --> 03:31:09.990
INCARCERATION AND PUNISHMENT

03:31:10.057 --> 03:31:12.993
HAS COST THE STATE FAR TOO MUCH

03:31:13.060 --> 03:31:15.496
MONEY WITH VIRTUALLY NO

03:31:15.562 --> 03:31:18.232

PASSION ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I

03:31:22.369 --> 03:31:23.837
THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE TURN

03:31:23.904 --> 03:31:26.273
THAT CORNER AND SEE THAT THERE

03:31:26.340 --> 03:31:28.675
ARE OTHER AND BETTER WAYS TO

03:31:28.742 --> 03:31:31.278
RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. WE NEED

03:31:31.345 --> 03:31:33.714
THE WILL. TO USE THE RESOURCES

03:31:33.781 --> 03:31:36.116
THAT WE HAVE TO EFFECTUATE

03:31:36.183 --> 03:31:38.352

IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING

03:31:57.337 --> 03:31:58.472
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND I THINK

03:31:58.539 --> 03:32:00.407
THAT. THERE COMES A TIME THAT

03:32:00.474 --> 03:32:01.108
WE HAVE TO STEP OF FOR OUR

03:32:01.175 --> 03:32:04.611

THEM TO COME OUT OF IT AND I

03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:16.790
ALWAYS THINK OF THEM AS ADULTS

03:32:16.857 --> 03:32:19.293
AND WE DON'T GIVEN THE

03:32:19.359 --> 03:32:20.260
OPPORTUNITY NOW EIGHT. IT JUST

03:32:20.327 --> 03:32:22.296
REALLY NOT. UP AND GIVING THEM

03:32:22.362 --> 03:32:24.465
THE OPPORTUNITY. TO RECTIFY

03:32:24.531 --> 03:32:26.333
THEIR BEHAVIOR AND DA'S SOMEONE

03:32:27.568 --> 03:32:29.002
PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION

03:32:29.069 --> 03:32:31.105

03:34:49.176 --> 03:34:49.643
FIFTEEN WHEN THEY COMMIT A

03:34:49.710 --> 03:34:51.144

03:34:58.385 --> 03:34:59.786
SKINNY ON A SOMEWHAT THEM IT'S

03:34:59.853 --> 03:35:00.921

NEVER GOING TO GET THEM TO DO-

03:35:03.156 --> 03:35:04.558
WHAT'S RIGHT IN SOCIETY. BUT

03:35:04.625 --> 03:35:05.859
THERE ARE SOME WHO GENUINELY

03:35:05.926 --> 03:35:06.793
COME OUT OF THERE THAT HAVE

03:35:06.860 --> 03:35:07.694
BEEN IN THE SYSTEMS AND THEY

03:35:07.761 --> 03:35:09.463
WERE FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. AND

03:35:09.529 --> 03:35:11.431
THEY COME OUT AND THEY HAVE

03:35:11.498 --> 03:35:12.966
BEEN IN A FOOD LINE. FOR THE

03:35:13.033 --> 03:35:14.601
LAST. FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS

03:35:14.668 --> 03:35:15.769
GETTING THEIR FOOD FROM A

03:35:15.836 --> 03:35:18.005
TRAIN- AND GOING AT A CAFETERIA

03:35:18.071 --> 03:35:19.840
STYLE. AND SO I HAD THIS YOUNG

03:35:19.906 --> 03:35:21.074
MAN CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND HE

03:35:21.141 --> 03:35:22.709

03:35:31.351 --> 03:35:32.786
WHICH IS THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN

03:35:32.853 --> 03:35:34.054
WHICH THEY GROW UP IN. SO I

03:35:34.121 --> 03:35:34.988
THINK THAT IF WE HAVE THE

03:35:35.055 --> 03:35:37.090
OPPORTUNITY TO- DO REAL

03:35:37.157 --> 03:35:38.859

03:35:56.576 --> 03:35:57.878
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA.

03:35:57.944 --> 03:35:58.845
THAT IF THERE'S A WILL THERE'S

03:35:58.912 --> 03:36:00.514
A WAY AND THERE DEFINITELY IS A

03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:01.682

WISE. SO SAGE BEYOND THEIR

THEY'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH. TO

BE HELD IN A PARTICULAR TYPE OF

03:38:16.583 --> 03:38:22.589

THEM WITH FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS.

03:38:29.529 --> 03:38:31.731
THAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME

03:38:31.798 --> 03:38:33.800
VERY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES YOU

03:38:33.867 --> 03:38:35.569
KNOW THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

03:38:35.635 --> 03:38:37.037
THOSE IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU

A TWENTY YEAR OLD AND I DON'T.

03:38:42.209 --> 03:38:44.678
THINK THAT. REGARDLESS OF WHERE

03:38:44.744 --> 03:38:46.213
THE CASE STARTED I DON'T THINK

03:38:46.279 --> 03:38:48.949
IT'S WISE. TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S

03:38:49.015 --> 03:38:50.984
PERFECTLY SAFE. TO PUT

03:38:51.051 --> 03:38:53.453

03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:54.988
WHEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

03:38:55.055 --> 03:38:57.557
BY THE LAW YOU'RE RECOGNIZED AS

03:38:57.624 --> 03:38:59.860
AN ADULT NOT A CHILD. AND

03:38:59.926 --> 03:39:01.561
THOUGH IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR

03:39:01.628 --> 03:39:05.732
SURE THAT WE HAVE. PEOPLE EVEN

03:39:05.799 --> 03:39:07.901
IN THIS SITUATION I THINK IF

03:39:07.968 --> 03:39:09.069
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:39:09.135 --> 03:39:10.270

03:39:11.838 --> 03:39:14.274
FULL CONTEXT AND THAT IS THAT A

03:39:14.341 --> 03:39:15.976
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD I THINK COULD

03:39:16.042 --> 03:39:17.811
BE PLACED IN YOUR DANGER WHEN

03:39:17.878 --> 03:39:19.312
IN THE SAME FACILITY WITH ONE

03:39:19.379 --> 03:39:22.082

03:39:42.168 --> 03:39:43.303
JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT

03:39:43.370 --> 03:39:45.405
THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE PEOPLE

03:39:45.472 --> 03:39:48.842
IN THIS ROOM. HAVE NO MERCY

03:39:48.909 --> 03:39:50.877
TOWARD OUR YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS

03:39:50.944 --> 03:39:51.511
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SMART

03:39:51.578 --> 03:39:55.682
ABOUT. HOW THE SITUATION THAT

03:39:55.749 --> 03:39:56.283

ADDRESS US SOME REMARKS ABOUT-

03:40:11.197 --> 03:40:13.967
I THINK THE DEVELOPMENT AS OF

03:40:14.034 --> 03:40:15.835
OUR ADOLESCENTS AND- CERTAINLY

03:40:15.902 --> 03:40:18.471
IS A- PHYSICIAN WHO'S ACTUALLY

03:40:18.538 --> 03:40:20.273
SPECIFICALLY TRAINED AND

03:40:20.340 --> 03:40:22.008
DEVELOPMENT- YEAH I WOULD MAKE

03:40:22.075 --> 03:40:23.076
NOTE THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY

03:40:23.143 --> 03:40:25.211
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A

03:40:25.278 --> 03:40:26.079
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A TWENTY

03:40:26.146 --> 03:40:27.547
ONE YEAR OLD AND I'M SURE THE

03:40:27.614 --> 03:40:29.783
FACILITY. HAVING EXPERIENCE

SEIZURES AND POLICIES TO

ADDRESS THAT I THINK THAT WE

03:40:38.058 --> 03:40:39.326
ALSO SHOULD THINK THOUGH AND

03:40:39.392 --> 03:40:40.193
WHAT THEY THINK THIS BILL

03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:42.362
ADDRESSES IS THAT YOU IF YOU

03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:45.532

03:40:45.599 --> 03:40:46.900
NOW IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES WHO

03:40:46.967 --> 03:40:49.235
IS BASICALLY STILL HAVE SOME

03:40:49.302 --> 03:40:51.738
TIME LEFT TO IS BEEN IN A

03:40:51.805 --> 03:40:54.274
JUVENILE FACILITY. THAT DOESN'T

03:40:54.341 --> 03:40:58.144
MAKE SENSE BOTH EITHER FOR THAT

03:40:58.211 --> 03:40:59.980
A JUNE THAT PERSON I AM A

03:41:00.046 --> 03:41:01.181
COMMON JUVENILE MORE OF THEIR

03:41:01.247 --> 03:41:03.016
IN THEIR TWENTIES BUT TO THEN

03:41:03.083 --> 03:41:04.851
BE TRANSFERRED TO AN ADULT

03:41:04.918 --> 03:41:06.920
PRISON WHERE THERE'S A VERY

03:41:06.987 --> 03:41:09.489
DIFFERENT CULTURE OR THEIR NOW

03:41:09.556 --> 03:41:13.226
EMBEDDED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE.

03:41:13.293 --> 03:41:14.561
HE BASICALLY PERHAPS HAVE A

03:41:14.628 --> 03:41:17.030

CETERA SO I MEAN. IF YOU KNOW

03:41:18.965 --> 03:41:22.235

CERTAINLY CAN THROUGH THEIR

03:41:30.276 --> 03:41:31.378
PROCEDURES I THINK HE'D BE ABLE

03:41:31.444 --> 03:41:32.612
TO MANAGE SOMEONE THE

03:41:32.679 --> 03:41:34.381
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FIFTEEN OR

03:41:34.447 --> 03:41:35.782
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD AND A TWENTY

03:41:42.355 --> 03:41:43.923
BENEFICIAL TO TAKES SOMEONE

PRISON. TO COMPLETE- TERM AND

03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:52.766
THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO

03:41:52.832 --> 03:41:55.201
BE HELPFUL EITHER TO THE PRISON

03:41:55.268 --> 03:41:56.169
TO SOCIETY AS WELL IN TERMS OF

03:41:56.236 --> 03:41:59.072

03:42:17.557 --> 03:42:20.827
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS WITH

03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:24.164
CENTER HANCOCK CENTERS SKINNER.

03:42:24.230 --> 03:42:25.899
AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS

03:42:25.965 --> 03:42:27.934
AND I TEND TO LOOK AT THE

03:42:28.001 --> 03:42:30.937
NUMBERS THE RESEARCH AND THE

03:42:31.004 --> 03:42:33.773
RESEARCH SHOWS ONE THING IT'S

03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:36.276
WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. FAR MORE

03:42:36.342 --> 03:42:39.679
EXPENSIVE. TO PUT A YOUNG

03:42:39.746 --> 03:42:41.748
PERSON EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE.

03:42:41.815 --> 03:42:45.285
INTO A ADULT FACILITY BECAUSE

03:42:45.351 --> 03:42:48.421
YOU WILL HAVE A LONGER TERM.

03:42:48.488 --> 03:42:49.789
EVENTUALLY OVER THE LIFE OF

03:42:49.856 --> 03:42:52.158
THAT PERSON STAY IN IN PRISON

03:42:52.225 --> 03:42:54.794
NOT THEY THEY WILL GO BACK TO

03:42:54.861 --> 03:42:56.730
PRISON BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST LIKE

03:42:56.796 --> 03:43:02.302
PUTTING A MAN CRIME COLLEGE. IF

03:43:02.368 --> 03:43:03.870
YOU PUT A YOUNG PERSON IN AN

03:43:03.937 --> 03:43:06.840
ADULT FACILITY. IT'S EXTREMELY

03:43:06.906 --> 03:43:08.775
HERE IN HUMANE TO PUT SOMEBODY

03:43:08.842 --> 03:43:11.211
THAT'S A YOUNG PERSON. IN AN

03:43:11.277 --> 03:43:14.314
ADULT FACILITY. I THINK THAT WE

03:43:14.380 --> 03:43:16.149
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT NUMBERS

03:43:16.216 --> 03:43:20.453
WHAT'S THE COST OKAY. THE STATE

03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:24.958
JUVENILE CORRECTIONS FACILITIES

03:43:25.024 --> 03:43:27.127
THEY RUN ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

03:43:27.193 --> 03:43:28.928
THOUSAND PER INMATE PER YEAR.

03:43:28.995 --> 03:43:31.865
WE FORTUNATELY HAVE A NEW

03:43:31.931 --> 03:43:32.499
REFORM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:43:32.565 --> 03:43:34.934
DOING. OVER THE NEXT YEAR

03:43:35.001 --> 03:43:40.540
FINALLY. TO FOCUS. A LIMITING

03:43:40.607 --> 03:43:45.078
DOUBT AND CREATING A NEW AGENCY

03:43:45.145 --> 03:43:45.612
UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

03:43:45.678 --> 03:43:48.581
SERVICES AGENCY. WE SHOULD

03:43:48.648 --> 03:43:50.917
UNDERSTAND THAT- JUVENILE

03:43:50.984 --> 03:43:53.553
FACILITIES IN THE STATE YOU

03:43:53.620 --> 03:43:55.455
KNOW WHAT THE YOU KNOW WHAT THE

03:43:55.522 --> 03:43:58.391
OCCUPANCY IS LESS THAN A THIRD

03:43:58.458 --> 03:44:01.461
ARE OCCUPIED. I REPEATTHAT

03:44:01.528 --> 03:44:03.997
THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE LESSEN

03:44:04.063 --> 03:44:07.700
THE THIRD ARE OCCUPIED. TO ME

03:44:07.767 --> 03:44:11.638
IT TO ME. THE GOAL IS TO PUBLIC

03:44:11.704 --> 03:44:13.873
SAFETY GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE A

03:44:13.940 --> 03:44:16.442
PERSON RESERVE A AND THE LEAGUE

03:44:16.509 --> 03:44:21.314
AND- TO CORRECT A MISTAKE THEY

03:44:21.381 --> 03:44:21.848
MADE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG

03:44:21.915 --> 03:44:25.451
PERSON. AND LEAD A BETTER LIFE.

03:44:25.518 --> 03:44:29.122
AND SO I THINK THIS THIS BILL.

03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:30.456
WILL BE A PERFORMANCE BILL

03:44:30.523 --> 03:44:32.625
IT'LL PERFORM BETTER THAN WHAT

03:44:32.692 --> 03:44:35.929
WE DO NOW. SO I VOTE I THINK

03:44:35.995 --> 03:44:37.263
THIS WILL SAVE MONEY. IT'S A

03:44:37.330 --> 03:44:43.770
HUMAN. IT HELPS THE HUMAN BEING.

03:44:43.837 --> 03:44:44.604
BUT IT ALSO SAVES A STATE A LOT

03:44:44.671 --> 03:44:46.506
OF MONEY YOU WANT TO KEEP

03:44:46.573 --> 03:44:48.708
