CHAIR OF BANKING COMMITTEE I

00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:54.579
ALSO BELIEVE THAT LENDERS HAVE A

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:57.182
BIG ROLE TO PLAY IN BRINGING

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:58.483
CALIFORNIA TO A MORE INCLUSIVE

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.219
HOUSING FUTURE. THE GOAL OF THIS

HEARING IS TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.457

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:06.758
FINANCIAL CHALLENGES HOMEOWNERS

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.427
FACE WHEN BUILDING AN EIGHTY YOU

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.363
IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.064
HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.666
STREAMLINING AND PROMOTING THE

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:16.968
USE OF ANY USE WHICH IS ACTUALLY

00:27:17.035 --> 00:27:19.838
A KEY TOOL TO BOOST HOUSING

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:22.574
SUPPLY PROMOTE DENSITY AND

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.676
IMPROVE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:27.412
BUT I REPEATEDLY FROM ADVOCATES

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:29.347
AND ALSO FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:31.449
FINANCING REMAINS A KEY STICKING

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:34.185
POINT. WE'VE REMOVED A LOT OF

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:36.421

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:38.857
KEY STILL REMAINS HOW DO THEY

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:41.259

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.600
SO WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AND WHAT

00:27:48.666 --> 00:27:50.068
KIND OF OPTIONS DO HOMEOWNERS

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.836
HAVE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE MUCH

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:55.206

RESEARCH THINK TANK BASED IN

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:26.804
WASHINGTON DC. BEFORE I BEGAN I

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.172

PROHIBITED EIGHTY CONSTRUCTION

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.582
BUT TODAY AS WE AS JUST MY- MANY

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.584
STATES AND STATE MANY CITIES

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.286
THAT STATES ARE INCREASINGLY

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:17.488
PERMITTING THE USE OF UNITS ARE

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.757

HOUSING SITUATION AROUND THE

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.664
COUNTRY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE IS

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:27.965
POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:31.068
FINE AS AS WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:32.937
MAJOR HURDLE TO BE OVERCOME THAT

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.139
COMES JACK INSTRUCTING IT TO USE

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:37.141
AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.010
FINANCING OF THREE IT JUST

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.211
DOESN'T IS AN EFFICIENT

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:44.048
MECHANISM. NATIONWIDE DEALS FOR

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:50.788
THE CONSTRUCTION OF EIGHTY YEARS. AT ADAM AT MASSIVE SCALE. SO

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.390

TO BE ANSWERING FOR. DIFFERENT

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:57.428
BUT- RELATED QUESTIONS FIRST

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:59.430
WOULD TALK ABOUT- WHAT YOU

PLAY AND RENOVATION FINANCING ON

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:14.378
THAT ORDER HAS PLACED AND THIS

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:17.014
SEGMENT AND IN THE RECENT PAST.

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.516
FINALLY I'LL CLOSE IT OUT WITH A

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:23.054
FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. TO

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.522
IMPROVE IF YOU FINANCE. FIRST

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.890
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OPTIONS

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:29.360
THAT MOST HOMEOWNERS-

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.562
CONSTRUCTING A- I WANTED TO

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.097
QUICKLY CONSTRUCT EIGHTY WAS AND

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:35.166
IF YOU RAISE. ONE WHICH SEEMS TO

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:37.201
BE BY FAR THE MOST COMMON IS TO

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:39.303
USE A UNIT WITH THE HOUSEHOLD

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.940
SAVINGS AND CASH. ORDER CAPE COD

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.208
OTHER HIGH INTEREST DEBTS SUCH

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.710
AS PERSONAL LOANS AND EVEN HARD

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:47.478
CREDIT CARDS ARE BEING USED AND

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:49.180
THEN YOU ALSO HAVE REALLY SHORT

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:53.885
TERM LOAN OPTIONS. TYPICALLY NO

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:54.452
MORE THAN A YEAR OR SO. THE

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.255
SECOND- WE FINANCING PARTY USE

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:59.724
IS TO. HOME EQUITY AND ARE THREE

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.325
WELL KNOWN PRODUCTS ON MY

COMPUTER. WHICH IS BASICALLY

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.862
ECHOES AND SEX PRODUCT HOME

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:08.065
EQUITY LINE OF. AND A CASH OUT

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:11.102
REFINANCE. AND THEN THE THIRD

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:12.236
PREDOMINANT EIGHTY YOU ARE

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:14.305
EIGHTY FINANCING RATE IS TO ACT

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.707
WHAT IS KNOWN AS A RENOVATION.

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.443
AND THAT TO MAIN BUCKETS OF

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.246
RENOVATION FINANCING THAT AVAIL

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:23.548
- ONE IS THROUGH A FEDERAL

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.916
AGENCIES SUCH AS FANNIE MAE

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:28.719
FREDDIE MAC FHA AND VA- AND THEY

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:29.720
PROVIDED THAT YOU KNOW THEY WORK

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:31.589
WITH LENDERS TO FINANCE OUR

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.157
RENOVATION FINANCING AND THEN

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.859
YOU HAVE NON FEDERAL FINANCING

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.827
AVAILABLE FROM. PRIVATELY HELD

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:41.365
BANKS THREE GENES. AND STATE

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:42.800
HOUSING FINANCE BEGINS. THE

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:43.768
ISSUE IS. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.603
ARE EITHER IN SCOPE OR HAVE

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.505
OTHER ACTS THAT MAKE EXTREME

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:50.074
DIFFICULT TO USE THEM AT. IT'S

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:53.511
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT DETAILS.

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.513
CUSTOMERS HOME LENDING AND THIS

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.315
INCLUDES GENERALLY SPEAKING HOME

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:59.050
EQUITY LOANS HOME EQUITY LINES

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:00.651
OF CREDIT AS WELL AS CASH OUT

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.620
YEAH. THE ISSUE HERE FAR

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:04.555
ESPECIALLY FOR A HOME EQUITY

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.824
LINES OF CREDIT IS THAT THE

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:08.292
UNDERWRITING REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.561
EXTREMELY STRINGENT THAT IS IF

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:11.862
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND FIND

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.598
THAT AVERAGE. MICHAEL SCORE THAT

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.299
IS NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR A HOME

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.168
EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT AS WELL IN

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:18.202
EXCESS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.637
SIXTY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE HIGH

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.473
ENOUGH INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.342
SUCH A LONG. SECOND HOME EQUITY

00:37:24.408 --> 00:37:25.643
LENDING WHETHER IT'S CASH OUT

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.111
REFINANCE YOUR LOCKS OR HOME

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:30.181
EQUITY. LOANS ARE USUALLY CAPPED

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:31.949
AT 80% OF THE CURRENT MARKET

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.118
VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. AMINO

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.921
ACIDS GET OUT AGAIN R. AS PEOPLE

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:39.156
ARE LIVING IN THEIR HOMES.

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:40.625
THEY'RE ALSO GETTING MORE AND

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.426
MORE PRIMARY MORTGAGE DEBT IN

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:44.962
FACT FOR MANY SENIORS DOWN. THE

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:46.631
FRONT THE VOLUME UP THE PRIMARY

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:47.398
MORTGAGE DEBT THAT THEY'RE

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:48.966
GETTING INTO RETIREMENT HAS ON

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:51.268
THE GROUND. SO THIS 80% CAP ON

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:53.704
ON. ON ON THE FOLLOWING.

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:56.073
ACTUALLY IT'S A HUGE BARRIER FOR

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.275
MANY OF THOSE FOLKS. AND THEN

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.144
THE THIRD MAJOR ISSUE WITH HOME

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.779
EQUITY LENDING IS THAT IT SIMPLY

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.414
DOES NOT CONSIDER THE INCOME.

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.249
THE EIGHTY YOU ARE WILL LIKELY

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:06.851
GENERATE AND UP IN THE FUTURE SO

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.452
IT SEEMS PERFECTLY LOGICAL TO ME

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.055
YOU ACT- YOU'LL SHOULD GET SOME

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.057
CREDIT. HE'S PARTIAL CREDIT FOR

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.992
THE RENTAL INCOME BUT YOU WOULD

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.428
GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. SO

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.362
THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE OF THE HOME

00:38:18.429 --> 00:38:20.464
EQUITY LENDING. AND THEN AS FAR

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:22.500
AS THE APPRAISAL IS CONCERNED WE

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:23.601
HAVE ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THERE

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:26.203
WHICH IS- THE BACK HOME EQUITY

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.139
LENDING IS SIMPLY NOT OPTIMIZED

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:37.281
FOR. FINANCING. USE BECAUSE IT

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:38.482
DOES NOT CONSIDER. THAT IS THE

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:39.483
LOAN THAT YOU CAN GET IS BASED

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.918
ON PROPERTY VALUE AT THE TIME OF

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:43.254
THE APP WITH. NOT GONNA LET YOU

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.089
OFF THE- ONE THE EIGHTEENTH AND

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.323
IS COMPLETE MAJOR SEEMS VERY

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.359
BACKWARDS TO MAKE. ABOUT GENGHIS

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:51.062
ARE SOME WITH OUR- FOR MOSTLY A

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:52.997
WOULD BE WORTH SECOND. IS GO ON

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.732
THE SOME ISSUES NEED TO BE

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:56.634
WORKED OUT THERE. AGAIN ANOTHER

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.669
HUGE. THAT LET ME HOW MUCH MONEY

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:00.738
ARE CAN I BORROW TO FINANCE YOU

AND IN I A PRODUCT OF FINANCE ET

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:13.050

MOST OF THESE LENDING PROGRAMS

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:48.312

HAVE COMES ARE HIGH IN. ON AND

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.830
THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE AROUND

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.298
THE LENDING CAP WHICH IS SET AT

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:10.901
EIGHTY PERCENT- THE APPRAISAL

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:27.951
EIGHTY LOANS ARE RENOVATION

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:30.087
LOANS IN GENERAL ARE SMALLER IN

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:32.022
SIZE THAN MENTIONED EARLIER. THE

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:34.691
AVERAGE VENTILATION LOAN IN

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:35.659
TWENTY TWENTY WHAT ABOUT SEVENTY

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:36.627
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.495
LENDERS LOOKING AT THAT COLOGNE

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:39.897
AND COMPARING IT TO A HOME

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.098
PURCHASE LOAN THAT COULD EASILY

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:43.467
BE YOU KNOW 400-500-6000

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.035
DOLLARS. A LENDER HAS EVERY

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.271
INCENTIVE TO MAKE. A LOAN TO A

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.805
BAR WENT BACK ONCE YOU GET A

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.174
BIGGER LOAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.075
THAT DOES GET COMPENSATED THE

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:53.443
LAUNCH OF THE LOAN AMOUNT. I HAD

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.412
THAT COMPENSATION ITSELF I THINK

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.581
THERE'S ALSO A SMALL LOAN. AT

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:59.149
ASPECT TO THE RENOVATION

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.318

SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.076
KNOW WE SHOULD THINK OF WHAT

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:28.045
PRIVATE MARKETS. YOU MIGHT LOOK

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.599
ABOUT 12% OFF OUR HOUSING STOCK

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.701
NATIONALLY WAS BETTER- IN THE

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.970
YEAR NINETEEN THIRTY NINE OR-

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:02.572
15% WAS BUILT BETWEEN NINETEEN

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:04.341
FORTY AND NINETEEN. FIFTY NINE

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:06.410
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THE

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:07.377
VERY LAST CALL AND YOU CAN SEE

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.945
THE CUMULATIVE SHARE FOCUS ON

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.782
THAT THIRD ROW FROM THE TOP- YOU

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:19.656
CAN SEE THAT. ABOUT 50% OF. THE

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:20.791
NASH NATION'S HOUSING STOCK. OR

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:23.093
JUST OVER HALF OF IT WAS- IS

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.262
MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OLD. A

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:26.330
QUARTER OF NATIONAL STOCK IS

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:27.764
MORE THAN. YEARS OLD NOW WHY DO

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.933
I BRING THIS UP ON ANY-

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.601
FINANCING HEARING. BECAUSE

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:34.738
HOUSING. FINANCING IS ALSO

00:49:34.805 --> 00:49:37.374
FINANCE YOU CAN. IT USING

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.875
RENOVATION FINANCING WHICH WE

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.010
ALL KNOW IT'S NOT WORKING AS

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.245
OPTIMALLY AS IT SHOULD BE. SO

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.314
THE POINT IS IF HE CAN FIX

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.883
RENOVATION FINANCING B. YOU WILL

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.085
NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.186
THE PROSPECTIVE EIGHTEEN

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:50.954
FINANCING. BUT WILL ALSO MAKE IT

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.156
EASIER FOR FOLKS TO PRESERVE

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.791
HOUSING BECAUSE AT THE END OF

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:55.792
THE DAY. HOUSING UNIT THAT IS

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.894
KEPT FROM GOING OBSOLETE IN THE

00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:59.229
HOUSING UNIT THAT'S BASICALLY

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.964
ADDED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:01.932
STACK AND WE DESPERATELY NEED

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:05.736
THAT IN THIS- IRAQ. YOU KNOW

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:13.343
RAPIDLY ESCALATING HOUSE PRICES. AND RENTS ACROSS THE NATION.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.345
SO ASK SLIDE JUST ARE YOU BUT

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:18.315
THE THING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:19.983
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ANIMATION

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.918
FINANCING. ARE FIRST AND

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:23.387
FOREMOST I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.789
ABSOLUTELY OVERCOME. THAT RISK

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.892
THAT THAT WINDOW STAYS THAT IS

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.961
THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE NO EASY WAY

00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:34.131
OF MITIGATING RISK. CONSTRUCTION

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.199
AND SO THEY NEED SOME ASSURANCE

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.334
THAT CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:38.735
COMPLETED ON TIME AND WITHIN

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.270
BUDGET IN THIS CABINET MEETING

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.805
AND A COUPLE OF MINUTES I THINK.

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.106
NOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT REMEMBER

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:46.943
BACK IN TWENTY. FIFTEEN TWENTY

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.011
SIXTEEN THE CITY OF DETROIT BUT

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.046
IT WAS- YOU KNOW FACING THAT

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:55.318
COLLECT OFF- ABANDONED HOMES-

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.253
THAT HAD FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR-

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.788
THAT JUST ALL THAT FROM. WHAT

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.623
THEY DID IS THAT THE SAME.

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:02.993
TEAMED UP WITH DEPOT TO THE BATH

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:05.228
HOUSE IN SOUTH ABANDONED HOMES.

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:08.064
AND A MASSIVE MASSIVE SCALE AND

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.833
SO THEY MANAGED VANTAGE OF THIS

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.101
APPROACH BUT AT HOME PEOPLE WAS

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.403
ABLE TO HIRE CONTRACTORS FROM

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.971
ITS EXISTING APPROVED VENDOR

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:17.007
LIST. AND SO THAT MADE SURE THAT

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.308
GAVE THE CITY OF DETROIT

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:20.043
CONFIDENCE THAT THE WORK WOULD

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.178
BE DONE IN A PROFESSIONAL

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.046
MANNER. AND THE CONTRACTORS THAT

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:23.947
YOU MIGHT EXPECT ON THIS LIST

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:26.817
ARE SUBJECT TO QUALITY STANDARDS

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.385
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND A LOT OF

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:30.053
OTHER READING. BRAIN SURE A

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.291
CERTAIN. MINIMUM LEVEL OF

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:35.125
QUALITY. AND THEN ON TOP OF

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:38.628
THAT. THE BEST LIST. LOGIC THE-

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:40.764
LABOUR BACK IT'S THE PAINT WAS

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:43.133
MATTER .COM ACCOUNTS WITH.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.637
CARPET STAND SO COULD. HI YOU TO

00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:49.272
BRING THESE NICKI YEAH AND YOU

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:50.907
KNOW AT MY BY THE THAT YOU HAVE

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.410
AND BUGS AND THEN. TRY THE LABOR

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:55.412
. WHEN STAR LIKE AND HIGHLY.

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.980
MANNER AND BENEFIT FROM THE

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.683
LARGE ECONOMY OF SCALE. THE FOR

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.751
THIS MODEL MUST ADVISE OPTED OUT

00:52:01.818 --> 00:52:03.553
SHOPPING. BUT A DATE. BEYOND A

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.422
REASONABLE. THAT THE MOUNTAIN

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.924
CAN ABSOLUTELY WORK. SO THAT'S

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:10.694
ONE APPROACH THAT- ONE CAN THINK

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.795
OFF SOMETHING THAT'S MARKET

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:14.297
AROUND THAT- ARE THEN THERE IS

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:16.166
ANOTHER YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO

00:52:16.233 --> 00:52:18.001
THROW OUT THERE. AND THAT HAS TO

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:23.306
DO WITH- ACTIVITY. EIGHTY UNITS-

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.542
WHAT THE THINGS THE STATE COULD

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.776
DO AS SORT OF MY TO SEE DAY AND

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:28.245
SEND TO HELP. THAT CAN START

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.814
ACTUALLY BUT USE. AN ADVANTAGE

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:32.349
OBVIOUSLY IS THE IF YOU ARE THIS

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:34.918
YEAR THAT IS. BE ASSEMBLED OR

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.953
PARTIALLY IN A FACTORY THEN YOU

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.188
ARE TAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION A

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:40.824
LOT THE CONSTRUCTION. DRESS THAT

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.926
LINGERS ON THE HOPE FOR TODAY

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.328
YOU ALSO HAVE A STANDARD PRODUCT

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.230
. IT'S LOWER COST TO BUILD. ITS

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:49.566
AGAIN IT'LL CUT CODE SO. WELL

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:52.035
THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE. AND SO IN

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.270
IN A MOMENT SOUNDS A LOT OF

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:56.439
PROBLEMS- THAT ONE SEES WITH THE

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.608
SITE. USING GOOGLE ACCORDING

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.143
SOME SORT OF A TAX INCENTIVE FOR

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.778
HOMEOWNERS THAT DO THIS BECAUSE

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:07.217
IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER. FOR

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:08.518
LENDERS TO PROVIDE FINANCING.

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:09.953
AND THEN YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.989
CENTRES FOR HOMO THAT EIGHTY

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:14.524
YOU. THE SECTION EIGHT HOLDERS

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.359

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:18.295
YOU WANT TO MOVE WORLD THERE. WE

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.363
WANT TO. DENTAL AND TO BE

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.198
CORPORATE INTO UNDER. SECTION

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.700
EIGHT MIGHT GIVE LAND SOME SUCH

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.202
. THAT THAT PERHAPS THAT THE

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:28.872
RISK OF THAT AND- NOT. HANK YOU

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:36.346
. THEY HAVE. HAVE HOW ABOUT YOU. AND FINALLY- IN TERMS OF

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:37.647
IMPROVEMENTS TO LAND AS I

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.916
MENTIONED EARLIER- YOU

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.484
UNDERWRITING IN MY- PROVIDER

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.486
MEANS THAT THE PERSON CREDIT FOR

00:53:43.553 --> 00:53:44.955
FUTURE RENTAL INCOME. BECAUSE

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:47.090
AGAIN THIS IS NOT- THIS IS NOT A

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:48.892
NICE TO HAVE THIS IS. THIS IS

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:51.094
SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY NEED. IF

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:52.729
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE LOWER

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:53.930
INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND SENIOR

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.398
HOMEOWNERS ARE LIVING ON FIXED

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.233
INCOMES TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.002
THIS TYPE OF FINANCING. YOU HAVE

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:01.705
TO FIX THAT PRETZELS. AND I'D

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.807
GET TO A WORLD WHERE WE'RE DOING

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:04.874
APPRAISALS ON AFTER THE PAIR

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.077
BASES. TODAY THIS IS DIFFICULT

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:09.646
IN OUR BECAUSE OF LACK OF COUNTS

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:15.018
BUT OVER TIME. AS MORE AND MORE

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.419
EASE GET. AND THEN YOU HAVE AND

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:17.687
ACCOUNTS OF THEIR OPEN A NEW.

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.990
THEY SHARED BE A PROBLEM THE

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:22.759
MESSED WITH- CITY AGAIN TODAY IS

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.996
THAT MAJOR FERRY AMONG. LIMITS

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:30.166
AMOUNT OF MY THEY CAN- WE HAVE

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:31.835
TO RAISE THAT ON MAXIMUM LOAN TO

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.437
BUY AFTER EIGHTY. EIGHTY PER OF

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.606
HIGHER NUMBER NINETY MAYBE 95%

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.241
AND YOU CAN. CONSIDER OF

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:39.609
MOTIVATE DO WITH THIS

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:42.112
SPECIFICALLY. AS LONG AS THE

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:44.681
FUNDS ARE USED TO FINANCE EIGHTY

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.249
WAS BECAUSE AGAIN 80% CAP WAS

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:47.884
LARGELY PUT IN PLACE AFTER THE

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.819
LAST RECESSION TO. PREVENT

00:54:49.886 --> 00:54:51.287
HOMEOWNERS FROM GETTING OVER

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:52.989
LEVERAGED AND SO WHAT IS WHAT

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:55.492
THE CAP YOU COULD THINK OF WERE

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.961
. RELAX THE GAP AS LONG AS THE

00:54:58.028 --> 00:55:01.464
FUNDS ARE USED TO FINANCE IT

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.732
USED. AND THEN THE FINAL THING

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.434
ON THE SECOND THING- IS JUST A

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:06.503
LITTLE- YOU KNOW CORPORATE

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:09.606
OBJECTIVES. FOR A- REAL- YOU

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:10.774
KNOW EIGHTY YOU'LL FIND A

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.475
APPROACH. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN YOU

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.310
GOT RIGHT NOW THAT IS THAT HE-

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:17.414
PUSH. IN THE INDUSTRY AMONG THE

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.416
REGULATORS IN WASHINGTON DC ON

STILL THERE SEVEN DAYS EARLY

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:40.370
STAGES OF THIS. LONGER TERM I

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:42.105
THINK THERE'S NO REASON YOU

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.440
COULD INCORPORATE SOMETHING LIKE

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.475
THAT THE APPROVED HOMEOWNERS. OR

YOU'RE IS. I GUESS I MENTIONED

00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.890
EARLIER A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS USE

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:03.093
THEIR CASH AND SAVINGS AND OTHER

LOANS ARE. CONSTRUCT EIGHTY WE I

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.333
THINK WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.535
A WAY FO THESE HOMEOWNERS TO

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.204
REFINANCE THESE PRODUCTS AND PAY

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.440
OUT THESE HAD INTEREST. IN

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:20.376
SUSTAINABLE- BUT THAT- BY THE

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:23.379
FINANCE M. TRADITIONAL REACH

IF IT'S WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES OR

YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.144
OVERLAP WITH ONE MY- FELLOW

PANELISTS JUST DESCRIBED. THE

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:37.013
FIRST BATTERY IS THAT THE EIGHTY

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.249
YEAR LET MARKET ISN'T A MERE AS

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:41.951
A OF THIS FAMILY. LENDING

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.019
NUMBERS THERE ARE FAR

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.888
PARTICIPANTS I'M NINETY PRODUCTS

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:47.590
IN THIS SPACE- KENNISON IN MY

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:49.993
PREVIOUS FINALIST- ALLUDED TO

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:51.261
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:53.029
FOR THIS- FOR INSTANCE SOME

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.664
TRADITIONAL MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.399
RESISTANT TO TAKING ON. THE

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:57.967
CONSTRUCTION MONITORING AND

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.502
VERIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:01.237
OFTEN REQUIRED IN EIGHTY YOU

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.473
CONSTRUCTION LOANS- ANOTHER

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.108
IMPORTANT REASON IS THE LACK OF

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:07.443
GOOD APPRAISALS APPARATUS DO NOT

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.646
YET HAVE A RELIABLE AND

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:10.680
CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:13.216
VALUING. AT U. S. THEY CONTINUE

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:18.888
TO RELY UPON. HARD TO FIND

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:19.822
COMPARABLES. THE SECOND MAIN

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.057
BARRIER THESE BORROWERS ACCESS

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.458
TO IT YOU STICK THIS IS

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:23.893
PARTICULARLY TRUE. FOR MIDDLE

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.062
AND MODERATE INCOME BORROWERS

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:27.530

HOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT. I

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:35.939
WENT TO THIS CHALLENGE AND AS

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.373
WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AS WELL

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.042
MOREOVER SKATING I USED EIGHTY

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:41.377
YOU FUTURE RENTAL INCOME TO

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:42.612
QUALIFY FOR A CONSTRUCTION

WORKER- ALONE ANIMATION ALONG OR

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:47.850
EVEN TO REFINANCE AFTERWARDS AND

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:51.854
THAT IS FOR FANNIE. MAE AND FHA

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.223
RULES. A THIRD BARRIER THE HYPE

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.259
COSTS THE CALIFORNIA IT IS

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:58.027
NUMBER FORTY CENTS TO SEE AN

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.296
EIGHTY YOU COSTING UPWARDS OF

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:00.897
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.598
TO BUILD. IF THE HOMEOWNER

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.001
INTENDS TO RENT A UNIT. RENTAL

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:06.602
INCOME NEEDS TO BE SUFFICIENT TO

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.738
COVER THE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.106
PROPERTY TAXES INSURANCE AND

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.475
MAINTENANCE AT A MINIMUM AND

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.143
WHILE CERTAIN AREAS CERTAINLY

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.611
COMMAND RENTS THAT ARE

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.947
SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THESE HIGH

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.816
CONSTRUCTION COSTS COSTS.

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.584
HOMEOWNERS IN LOWER RENT AREAS

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:28.024
MAY STRUGGLE TO JUSTIFY THE COST. OF AN- ACCIDENT. ON THE FOURTH

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.960
OF RECENT. IS RISING INTEREST

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:32.962
RATES ARE SEVERAL OTHER LENDERS

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.297
AND WE WORK WITH AT COLLEGE OF

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.766
FATE I EXPECT NEW HOME

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.202
RENOVATION LOANS TO SLOW DOWN

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.704
SIGNIFICANTLY AS INTEREST RATES

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:42.972
ISE AND THIS IS BECAUSE THESE

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:45.775
PRODUCTS REQUIRE. HOMEOWNERS TO

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:48.277
REFINANCE OUT OF THEIR EXISTING

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.546
HISTORICALLY LOW RATE FIRST

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:55.184
MORTGAGE RIGHT. OFF. SO AS WE

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.452
DISCUSSED. OUR NEW LOOK AT

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:57.587
PROGRAM IT ISN'T FOR THE

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.722
COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.591
SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS AT-

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:04.694
SHUTTLE BELLER- IN HELLO COLLEGE

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.429
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WE WANT

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.598
TO MAKE SURE THAT- THROUGH SOUND

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:10.500
UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND I'M

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.402
DOING ANOTHER GUARD RAILS.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.037
PARTICIPATING HOMEOWNERS HAVE

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:17.607
THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THE

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:18.975
SUPPORT. TO AVOID THAT EIGHTY

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:22.311
PROTECTION ON. AND SO ALEX

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:23.913
PLAYED ALL THESE ISSUES INTO

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.282
CONSIDERATION WHEN DESIGNING OUR

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.950
BROAD STRATEGY TO TACKLE.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.087
FINANCING ON OUR MULTI PRONGED

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.889
APPROACH HAS TO BE MADE

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:35.191
COMPONENTS THE FIRST COMPONENT

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.760
OF THE FIRST PROBLEM IS STANDING

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.096
UP THIS STATE EIGHTY YOU. RIGHT

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:43.699
THIS SECOND HE'S EXPANDING THE

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:46.402
BLOOD BANKERS AND THAT INCLUDES

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:49.272
THE TALKING TO LOCALITY CDFI.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:52.141
AND OTHERS AND FINALLY THE THIRD

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.843
PROBLEM IS PARTNERING WITH

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:58.981
EIGHTY YOU MANUFACTURERS AND

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.583
TO CONSUMERS. SO TO IS DOING

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.185
WORK ON ALL THREE TRACKS SIMILAR

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.986
TENUOUSLY AND WE HAVE INVESTED

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.389
SIGNIFICANT TIME IN CONSTRUCTING

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.057
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.559
HIS FIRST PROBLEM THAT PROGRAM

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.594
THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM. TO

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.329
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.531
LENDING CAPACITY. TO FULLY

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:17.500
SCALED UP AROUND. THE FIRST

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.568
PHASE IS BECOMING FULLY

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.403
OPERATIONAL AS WE SPEAK HI WHICH

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.405
WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR THE SECOND

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.540
AND THIRD ROUNDS OF THE STRATEGY

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:25.641
TO COME TO FRUITION LATER IN

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:28.878
TWENTY TWENTY TO. HANDLE SOME

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.746
TINY THREE. SO ARE ABOUT PROGRAM

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.883
IS. TO BE A STRONG INCENTIVE BUT

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.751
WITH AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL EQUITY

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.720
FOCUSED HANNITY'S DELIVER.

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:40.356
MILLION REQUEST SYSTEM SIMILAR

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.958
TO COLLEGE A FACE DOWN PAYMENT

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:42.725
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS A

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:45.828
PROVEN. I'M SEASON METHOD ALSO

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:47.630
SALEABLE FINANCING SO IN A

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.732
NUTSHELL. OUR NEW PROGRAM

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:50.666
DEPLOYED A HUNDRED MILLION

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:55.938
DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:58.040
WITH. THE FIVE THOUSAND. DOLLARS

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.809
TO HELP THEM BUILD AN EIGHTY AND

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.944
IT IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE FOUR

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:04.447
THOUSAND. EIGHT USE OVER THE

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:06.916
NEXT FEW YEARS. OUR SOCIAL MEDIA

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.685
OBJECT OBJECTIVES ARE REFLECTED

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.254
HOW WE DESIGN THE ELIGIBILITY

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.456
CRITERIA. TO PARTICIPATE A

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.825
HOUSEHOLD HAS TO BE OVERCOME

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:18.794
WHICH IS A IT'S A 100% THERE

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:20.596
MIGHT. BE LOW AND MODERATE

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.765
INCOME AND HAVE LESS THAN 20% IN

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.800
HOME EQUITY. ALREADY LONG

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.736
MODERATE INCOME QUALIFIED CENTER

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:31.641
TRACK WHICH. ARE IS A

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:32.375
CONCENTRATED POVERTY. THESE WERE

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:33.809
THE REAL WHERE THEY WOULD ENSURE

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.845
THAT WILL FOLK ON THOSE WHO CAN

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.481
NOT SIMPLY GET. AS I'M BEFORE.

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.783
INSURING THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.451
SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS THESE

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.719
PROJECTS IT IS AN ABSOLUTE

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.422
PRIORITY OF THAT PROGRAM. AND SO

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.523
COLLEGE IF THEY WILL DEPLOY

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.058
FINDS THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.360
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS TO HAVE.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.829
THE MOST IMPACT HOMEOWNERS WHILE

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.898
ENSURING THAT THE EAGLES ARE

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.401
BUILT SO PAIRING THESE RATS WITH

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.836
WHEN A PATIENT FINANCING. IS KEY

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:03.272
TO MAKING SURE THAT THE BORROWER

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.507
IS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.275
LENDERS ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:10.213
EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. AND

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.148
MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK IS NOT.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.550
INITIALLY ARE ANY OF MASS-

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:15.918
MAINLY DEPLOYED THROUGH

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.120
CULTIVATE EXISTING LENDER

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.255
NETWORK WHICH HAS A BROAD

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.690

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.128
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AND THERE'S

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:40.496
LOTS OF MOVING PARTS TOO

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.731
INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE SPECS ON

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.866
YOUR PROPERTY WHICH YOU CAN'T

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:46.068
CAN'T BUILD ON AND- ALL THE

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.536
COSTS THAT THEY'RE IN IN THAT GO

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.238
ALONG WITH IT SO FINDING A

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.006
PROJECT MANAGER ACTUALLY IS

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.307
REALLY HELPFUL AND SOMETHING

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:54.209
LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:57.312
NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO- DO

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.348
CONSTRUCTION LENDING. BECAUSE OF

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.449
THE MANY MOVING PARTS THAT ARE

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.451
THERE SO SOME PEOPLE DO OPT TO

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.619
DO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.021
DOING CASH OR CASH OUT REFINANCE

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.756
AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:08.457
LATER TOO WIDE FOR THAT ACTUALLY

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.559
IS REALLY GOOD AND HELPS THE BAR

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:11.960
WORDS BECAUSE IT'S- IT HELPS

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.562
PROTECT THEM ACTUALLY TO HAVE

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.430
SOMEBODY AS A PROJECT MANAGER

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.398
ALONG THE LINE I'M IN IN THE

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.300
CLOSING COSTS OF COURSE- CLOSING

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:19.968
BECAUSE AVERAGE ABOUT 1% OF THE

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.303
LOAN AMOUNT SO AGAIN IF YOU DO

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.305
CASH OUT REFINANCES THERE'S A

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:29.478
COST TO THAT PERSON IS ACTUALLY. USING CASH IF YOU HAVE A

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.379
LIQUID FUNDS AND- IF YOU YOU

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.380
KNOW YOU WERE. YOU'RE RIGHT

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:33.348
LOCKED SO YOUR RATES LOCKED ON A

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.283
CASH. REFINANCE TYPE OF A LOAN.

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:35.217
WHICH OFFERS PEOPLE A LOT OF

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:36.685
SECURITY SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:38.087
MOVEMENT IN THERE. WHERE THEY'RE

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.688
WORRIED ABOUT THAT THAT RATE

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:42.157
GOING UP WHICH WOULD ALSO MAKE

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.059
THE PAYMENT GO UP TO. SO NOW WE

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.327
TALK ABOUT A HOME EQUITY LINE OF

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:46.562
CREDIT FOR ANYBODY WHO'S NOT

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:47.996
FAMILIAR WITH THEM. THEY WORK A

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.765
LOT LIKE A CREDIT CARD. THANK

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.633
YOU YOU GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.202
THAT YOU ARE GIVEN FOR YOUR LOAN

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:54.770
AND WHATEVER YOU DRAW ON THAT

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:56.138
THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO PAY

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.407
BACK ON IT. SO AGAIN WE DID

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.275
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ADD TO THIS

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:01.477
WITH THE TWO OTHER PANELISTS

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.078
THAT IT ONLY GOES TO AN 80% LOAN

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.813
TO VALUE. SO THAT DEFINITELY IS

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.648
A LOOK AT RESTRICTING FOR.

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.183
BORROWERS THAT MIGHT NEED MORE

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.385
EQUITY IN AND- WE'LL TALK ABOUT

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.954
THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE TO.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.055
INTEREST ONLY PAYMENTS DURING

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.389
THE DRAW PERIOD TYPICALLY YOUR

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.091
HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:18.127
THEY HAVE A DROP. OF ANYWHERE

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.862
BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.864
AND THEN AFTER THAT IT BECOMES A

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.799
FULLY AMORTIZED LOAN FOR THE

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:26.235
REMAINDER OF THE TERM. SO BUT

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.803
FOR THE BEGINNING PIECE OF IT

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.138
YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY INTEREST

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.672
ONLY DURING THAT DROP PERIOD AND

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:31.940
YOU CAN PAY DOWN PRINCIPAL

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.509
ANYTIME YOU WANT TO SO THERE'S

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.610
DEFINITELY SOME FLEXIBILITY

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:37.012
THERE. IT ALSO MAKES FOR LOWER

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:37.613
PAYMENTS ON AN INTEREST ONLY

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.382
PERIOD. THAT PAYMENT PERIOD-

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:43.018
PAYMENTS ARE BASED AGAIN ONLY

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.620
AGAINST THE DRAWN AMOUNT SO

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.888
THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP INTO

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:47.923
CONSIDERATION WHEN. A PERSON IS

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.659
TRYING TO DO A HOME EQUITY. LINE

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.228
OF CREDIT TO BUILD. A AN EIGHTY

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:55.697
YOU- BASED ON SOME OF THE OTHER

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:56.665
TOPICS THAT WERE ROUGHT UP

01:13:56.732 --> 01:14:00.402
EARLIER. WHICH COULD BE THAT IT

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:01.937
MAY NOT. AND IT MAY NOT BECOME.

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:02.971
IN TWELVE MONTHS AND IF YOU HAVE

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.540
A SHORTER TERM LOAN THAT MIGHT

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.275
NOT BE SOMETHING. THAT WOULD

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:07.576
WORK IN CASE THAT THE

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.611
CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNIT GOES

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:11.880
LONGER. IT IS AN ADJUSTABLE RATE

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.549
SO THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.284
LONG THAT. SOME PEOPLE AREN'T

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:16.451
COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE THE

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.287
RATES CAN MOVE ON THEM IT'S NOT

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:21.490
A FIXED RATE. ALONE ITHAS A

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.791
TWENTY FIVE YEAR REPAYMENT TERM

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.126
THE MAJORITY OF THEM DO WHETHER

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.128
THEY HAVE A TEN YEAR DROP OR A

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.629
FIFTEEN YEAR DRAWN. AND THE

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.931
BORROWER MANAGE THE PAYMENT

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.833
MANAGES THE PAYMENTS TO THE

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.467
CONTRACTORS ON THESE TYPES OF

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.937
LOANS. SO ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.705
FOR THAT WOULD BE THAT IF THEY

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.273
ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.708
INSTRUCTION OR HOW THE

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.710
CONSTRUCTION PART OF IT WORKS.

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:44.146
UP BASED ON WHAT THE CONTRACTOR

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:46.014
IS SAYING IS COMPLETED ON THEIR

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:48.250
PROPERTY- IT'S REALLY ANOTHER

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.452
OPTION TO FOR THEM TO DO A

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.720
PROJECT MANAGER WHO IS SEPARATE

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.022
FROM. THE CONTRACTOR. THAT

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.457
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PROTECTS HOW

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:58.327
THE DRAWS ARE REQUESTED. BASED

01:14:58.393 --> 01:14:59.962
ON THE ACTUAL WORK THAT'S FINE.

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.597
SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW A HOME

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.465
EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT WORKS. ON

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.534
THE FIXED RATE SECOND MORTGAGES.

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.536
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BETWEEN A FIVE

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:08.570
TEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR TERM THAT

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.239
YOU CAN CHOOSE. IT'S A SHORTER

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.473
TERM LOANS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.242
HIGHER PAYMENTS SO THAT'S ALSO

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.576
THE DOWNSIDE TO THAT BECAUSE

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:16.545
IT'S NOT AS EASY TO QUALIFY FOR

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.080
THESE LOANS. ARE BECAUSE THE

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.581
PAYMENTS ARE HIGHER SO YOU HAVE

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:20.716
TO LOOK AT WHAT THE PERSON'S

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:23.118
DEBT TO INCOME RATIO IS AND- AND

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.253
THIS MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:25.554
THEM. FIXED RATE SECOND

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.056
MORTGAGES TYPICALLY HAVE- A

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:30.292
LOWER RATE TWO BUT BECAUSE THE

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.261
TERM IS LONGER AGAIN THAT THE

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.329
QUALIFYING IS A LITTLE HARDER-

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:38.734
AND THESE ALSO GO. UP TO AN 80%

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.335
LOAN TO VALUE ONLY. THANK THE

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.403
PAYMENTS BE. RIGHT WHEN THE LOAN

01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:42.638
FUNDS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:43.839
DIFFERENT THAN A HOME EQUITY

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:44.773
LINE OF CREDIT WHERE YOU'RE ONLY

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.609
EIGHTEEN. AS THE LOAN. PROCEEDS

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.645
ARE DRAWN. BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:50.812
DO A FIXED RATE SECOND YOU GET

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.281
THE MONEY RIGHT AWAY SO YOU PAY

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:53.982
BACK ON IT STARTING FROM THE DAY

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.051
THAT IT FINDS. A BORROWER WOULD

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:58.720
ALSO MANAGE THE PAYMENTS TO THE

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:00.722
CONTRACTORS ON THIS TYPE OF A

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.125
LOAN. AT THE END OR HIRE A

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:05.627
PROJECT MANAGER TO HELP THEM

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.429
ALONG THE LINES TO. SO NOW I

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:09.464
WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.700
OUR HISTORY WITH. THIS PRODUCT

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.168
THAT WE CREATED IT'S CALLED V.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.937
ET YOU. ARE KEY LOCK

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:16.905
CONSTRUCTION LOAN AND WE STARTED

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.774
ACTUALLY WE MET WITH THE- WITH

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.510
CEMETERY COUNTY. OF HOUSING IN

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.812
MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.647
THEY'VE REALLY BROUGHT US TO THE

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.382
TABLE TO SAY THAT THEY WERE

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.350
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.952
CAN HELP ASSISTANCE PEOPLE

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:31.954
WITHIN THE COUNTY. TO BUILD AN

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:32.788
EIGHTY YOU WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:33.822
FOR SOMEONE TO HELP THEM WITH

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.824
THE FINANCING OF IT AND- AND WE

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.559
HAD SORT OF TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.027
ABOUT MAYBE DOING SOME TYPE OF

01:16:39.094 --> 01:16:40.162
EIGHTY YOU FINANCING BUT HADN'T

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.596
REALLY. COME UP WITH A PRODUCT

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:43.832
OR PROGRAM YET SO WE MET WITH

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.400
THEM IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEN

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.869
WE WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE AND

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.438
SAT DOWN AND REALLY. PUT PEN TO

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:50.772
PAPER TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:52.674
COULD WE DO THIS SO THAT. WE

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.476
WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP NOT JUST

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:55.811
THOSE THAT WOULD QUALIFY WITH

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.913
THE HIGHER RATES. AND THE HIGH

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.982
VALUES BUT- I'M SORRY HIGHER

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.283
INCOME AND HIGH VALUES BUT SOME

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:03.218
OF THOSE ALSO THAT WERE IN OUR

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.653
BACKYARD THAT DEFINITELY DIDN'T

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.988
FALL INTO EITHER OF THOSE

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:08.156
CATEGORIES SO WE WANTED TO- AS A

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.458
CREDIT UNION AS WE ALWAYS DO

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:11.093
HELP OUR COMMUNITY AND- WE CAME

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.527
UP WITH A PRETTY ROBUST PRODUCT

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:15.197
THAT I THINK- IS. IT'S HELPING

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.032
OUT PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:18.100
THE OPTION NOW THAT THEY MIGHT

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.468
BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS AND I'LL

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.236
TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE BUT-

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.471
WE ALSO WORK WITH HELLO HOUSING

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.572
WHICH IS A NONPROFIT THAT

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:25.674
SUPPORTS HOMEOWNERS IT'S A- IT'S

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:27.009
A ONE STOP SHOP AND IT HELPS

01:17:27.075 --> 01:17:29.711
WITH. ALL PHASES OF BUILDING AN

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.879
EIGHTY YOU AND INCLUDING THE

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:33.715
DESIGN- THE COSTS THEY ACTUALLY

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.351
REFER BUILDERS. AND THEY ARE THE

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:37.853
PROJECT MANAGERS SO THEY WALK

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.955
THE BAR WORSE THROUGH EVERYTHING

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:42.090
FROM THE INITIAL PLANS TO

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.559
PERMITTING. WHICH IS SUCH AN

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.294
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS FOR-

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.696
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:49.464
CONSTRUCTION LENDING AND PATENT

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.298
CONSTRUCTION BUILDING AND HOW

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.601
TO. HOW TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THE

DAY FUNCTIONS AND WE'VE SEEN

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:14.836
OTHERS THAT I. HAVE HAD THEM.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.005
BUILT THAT ARE HAVING PEOPLE

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.574
THAT. WERE HELPING THEM. LIVING

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.976
IN THE EIGHTY YOU NOW SWITCH

01:21:21.042 --> 01:21:26.681
OVER WHEN THE. HOMEOWNER IS YOU

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:28.149
KNOW. AS HIS AGE OUT OF THE

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:29.351
HOME. AND THEY NEED A SMALLER

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.585
PLACE LIVE BUT THEY STILL NEED

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:31.753
SOMEBODY. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.488
GO INTO A- CONVALESCENT HOME SO

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.389
WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN TO WHERE

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:37.659
THE- THE HEALTH CARE PERSON. WAS

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:38.660
LIVING IN THE EIGHTY WAS

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:39.794
ACTUALLY MOVED INTO THE- MAIN

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:40.762
HOME AND THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.330
MOVED INTO THE EIGHTY YOU SO.

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.431
THEY CAN STILL STAY ON THE

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:44.866
PROPERTY SO THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.301
BENEFIT OF THIS TO PRESS THAT

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:47.636
WERE SEEN THAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.471
MORE ABOUT IT EVERY DAY

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:52.674
ACTUALLY- NEXT LINE. SO THE

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.042
CONSTRUCTION HE LOCK SO WHAT IS

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.277
IT IT'S A TWELVE MONTH LINE OF

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.978
CREDIT. IT'S IN SECOND LIEN

01:21:57.045 --> 01:22:00.015
POSITION IT HAS AN INTEREST ONLY

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.950
PAYMENTS. IT IS A VARIABLE RATE.

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:03.652
AND ITS ADVANCE MONTHLY SO WE DO

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.353
THE DRAWS ON THIS LOAN. EACH

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.190
MONTH AND- WE SET IT UP AS A

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:10.292
TWELVE MONTH LINE OF CREDIT THE

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:11.760
REASON WHY WE DID THE- THE TERM

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:13.228
ON THIS IS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.130
MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS. A AN

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.832
END PERIOD. FOR THE R. WORD TO

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.801
KNOW THAT ONCE THIS PHONE ENDS

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.603
ONCE THE LOAN ENDS IN TWELVE

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:22.704
MONTHS THE CONSTRUCTION HAS TO

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.973
BE COMPLETED. AND THAT'S REALLY

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.274
THE END FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:28.009
GET TO FOR THEM TO COMPLETED IN

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:29.577
A TIMELY MANNER AND HAVE THE

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:33.081
pPROPERTY TYPE AGAIN IT'S A-

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.549
EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY HOME

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.718
IT'S- OWNER UP. OCCUPIED AS THE

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.087
PRIMARY RESIDENCE. OF THE DRAWS

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:41.189

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.491
RETAINED EDGE- THERE'S- THERE

SUBMITTED BY THE PROJECT

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.561
MANAGERS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.329
THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.363
REQUIRE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.632
THAT- INTERNET LATER SLIDE- AND

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:51.900
THEN WE ALSO HAVE A TEN PERCENT.

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.868
RETAINED EDGE THAT'S RELEASED ON

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:56.438
THE LAST DRAW REQUESTS SO. WE

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:58.273
NEED TO SEE A- CERTIFICATE OF

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.774
COMPLETION FROM THE CITY AND

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:01.776
THEN ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT BUT

THEM ALSO. GOOD IN THE NEXT

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.453
FIVE. SO SOME OF THIS. ON THIS

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:12.821
LOAN WHICH IS EXCITING FOR US IS

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.556
THAT THE BORROWER CAN BORROW UP

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:16.691
290% OF THE AS COMPLETED VALUE

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:18.326

VALUE WHICH- THE PANELISTS

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.731
EARLIER WERE TALKING ABOUT- AND

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:23.932
WE CAN ALSO USE THE FUTURE

01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.667

LIES WE REQUIRED THAT THE BAR

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.951
WOULD UTILIZE. A PROJECT MANAGER

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.519
THAT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.455
CONTRACTOR. AND THE REASON FOR

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:56.157
THAT IS THERE YOU KNOW A THIRD

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.293
PARTY ESSENTIALLY AND THEY ARE

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.628
THERE TO PROTECT THE- BAR WORK

01:25:00.695 --> 01:25:02.530

CONTRACTOR TO STAYS ON TIME AND

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:05.967
THEY COMPLETE YOU KNOW THE

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:07.235
PHASES THAT THERE SAID THEY SAID

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:08.703
THEY WOULD DURING THAT. SAYS

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.138
SCHEDULE THAT WE GET AT THE VERY

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:12.040
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF THE

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:16.110
LOAN APPLICATION. SO THEY KEEP

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.111
THEM ON TRACK TO CLOSE WITHIN

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:17.712
TWELVE MONTHS. AND THEY ALSO

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.747
HAVE TO CONFIRM THE CONSTRUCTION

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.850
PLAN- IN THAT IT CAN BE

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.451
COMPLETED WITHIN THE BUDGET AND

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:25.420
THE SCHEDULE SO. THAT'S WHY

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:28.022
WE'VE RECORDED THAT- IN OUR-

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:29.757
PROJECT FOR THE IN OUR IN OUR

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:31.893
CONSTRUCTION SHE LOCKED WE ARE

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.528
REQUIRING A PROJECT MANAGER ON

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:34.696
ANY OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WE DO

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.197
WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT WE JUST

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:37.198
TALK THROUGH THAT WITH THE

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.299
MEMBER TO EDUCATE THEM THAT

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:39.667
THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION THAT THEY

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:41.069
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT. IF

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:42.704
THEY'RE DOING A CASH CASH OUT

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.739
REFINANCE HE BARKER A FIX SECOND

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.574
MORTGAGE- BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.042
REQUIRED BUT THIS WE FEEL LIKE

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:49.377
PROTECTS OUR MEMBERS BY DOING

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:51.613
THAT WITH THIS ONE- THE BORROWER

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.147
COMPLETES THE HE LOCK BUILD LOAN

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.383
AGREEMENT. WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

01:25:55.450 --> 01:25:57.318
ARE SIGNING IN THAT- THEY ARE.

01:25:57.385 --> 01:26:00.154
GREEN TO HIRE A PROJECT MANAGER

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:01.723
USE A CONTRACTOR THAT HAS A

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:04.425
LICENSE WITH THE STATE- AND-

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:06.261
THAT THEY ARE VERIFYING THE COST

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.263
BASED ANALYSIS THAT THEY AGREE

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.198
TO THAT. THAT'S THE COST OF

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:12.267
THEIR- PROJECT TO BE BUILT. BUT

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.035
WE DO REQUIRE PRE CONSTRUCTION

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.337
AS COMPLETED APPRAISAL SO WE

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.039
DON'T WANT TO GO IN AND DO THIS

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.140
LOAN FOR ANYBODY THAT'S ALREADY

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:20.475
STARTED CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:21.643
THERE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:22.944
REASONS BEHIND THAT AND SO WE

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.746
CAN'T LOAN TO ANONE UNLESS THEY

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:27.048
ACTUALLY- HAVE THE PRE

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.951
CONSTRUCTION- AS- COMPLETED

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.486
APPRAISAL DONE. AND THEN WE

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.655
REQUIRE A FINAL- RECERTIFICATION

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.189
OF THAT APPRAISAL SO AFTER

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.457
TWELVE MONTHS WHETHER THEY

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.426
REFINANCE INTO A FIXED SECOND

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.627
MORTGAGE IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.362
REFINANCE INTO A NEW FIRST

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.998
MORTGAGE- WE WOULD JUST NEED A

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:45.466
RESTART OF THE APPRAISAL SO THEY

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:49.470
DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND PAY

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.039
FOR A FULL APPRAISAL. YEAH I

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:51.873
NEXT I. AM GUIDELINES SORGE.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.675
LOAN VALUE GOES UP 290% AS I

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.811
SAID. AND 75% OF THE POTENTIAL

01:26:56.878 --> 01:27:00.114
RENTS USED TO QUALIFY OR- WE

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.282
ALLOW FOR THE FOR THE BORROWERS

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:04.385
SO. THOSE TWO ITEMS ALONE- HAVE

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:07.155
HELPED THE THREE THAT WE HAVE

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.324
BEEN ABLE TO DO. THAT THEY HAD

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.125
TAKEN OUT A HOME EQUITY LINE OF.

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:13.494
CREDIT CONSTRUCTION LOAN BECAUSE

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:14.662
OF THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.497
HAVE AS MUCH- EQUITY IN THE

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.432
PROPERTY AND THEY NEEDED THAT

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:19.634
SO. THAT THE DIFFERENCE FOR WHAT

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:20.735
WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON THESE IS

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.503
THAT ARE THE FIRST MORTGAGE HAS

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.906
TO BE KEPT AT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.174
THE VALUE OF THE HOME AND THEN

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.308
THE SECOND MORTGAGE COULD BE THE

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:29.744
ADDITIONAL 10% SO WE GO UP 290%

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:30.878
OF THE FUTURE VALUE BUT THE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.580
FIRST MORTGAGE STILL HAS TO STAY

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.749
AT EIGHTY PERCENT. OUR MAXIMUM

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:35.883
DEBT TO INCOME RATIO WAS FORTY

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.051
EIGHT PERCENT. ARE ON OUR

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.486
MEDICAL MINIMUM FIGHT GO SCORE

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:40.521
ACTUALLY SIX EIGHTY SO I WOULD

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.290
GO A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN WHAT

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:43.625
AS SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.994
WERE. WERE SATING THAT- WHAT

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.162
WAS ON THERE SO- BECAUSE WE FEEL

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:51.099
LIKE IT'S DEFINITELY. ARE AT 40%

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.967
WITH A SIX EIGHTY CREDIT SCORE

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:53.635
YOU KNOW WERE ABLE TO HELP A LOT

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:55.370
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THAT- THAT

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.038
THAT MEDIUM RANGE RIGHT THERE.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.173
IN OUR RATE IS ACTUALLY THE BUT

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.274
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PRIME

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.910
INDEX MINUS ONE AND A QUARTER.

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:05.580
SO RIGHT NOW TODAY OUR FLOORS AT

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:09.317
2% WHICH IS- OUR CURRENT THE

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.985
PRIME RATE IS AT THREE POINT TWO

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:13.454
FIVE. AND SO WE'RE DOWN AT THE

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.423
FLOOR AT TWO SO. WE FEEL THAT

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.692
IT'S A PRETTY. AGGRESSIVE RATE

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.560
FOR OUR MEMBERS- IN ITS INTEREST

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.928
ONLY PAYMENTS TO DURING THIS

01:28:20.995 --> 01:28:22.597
TIME PERIOD THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:23.998
LOAN. AND THEY CAN PAY PRINCIPAL

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:25.566
DOWN ANYTIME THEY WANT SO IT

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:27.201
THERE'S NO WAY THAT PREPAYMENT

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.269
PENALTY OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.337
LINES IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT

01:28:29.404 --> 01:28:32.840
DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:33.541
THEY CAN'T. TO FOR SURE.

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.476
ALTHOUGH THE NEXT LINE. SO THESE

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.078
ARE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WE-

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.112
THAT WE SHARED WITH THE

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:39.681
POTENTIAL BORROWERS LIKE EXPLORE

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:41.382
YOUR FINANCING OPTIONS LIKE SEE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:42.984
WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE THAT

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:44.786
MIGHT BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO YOU.

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:46.254
VERSUS YOU DOING A CASH OUT

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.689
REFINANCE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.490
HAVE REFINANCED OVER THE LAST

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:50.324
TWO TO THREE YEARS AND I'VE

01:28:50.391 --> 01:28:51.492
GOTTEN THOSE GREAT LOW RATES ON

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:52.860
THEIR FIXED MORTGAGES AND- THEY

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:54.395
DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THOSE. SO

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.863
WHAT'S ANOTHER OPTION FOR THEM

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.331
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WHERE THEY

01:28:57.398 --> 01:29:00.268
COULD BUILD. AND- ALSO STILL

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.970
HAVE A DECENT. MORTGAGE PAYMENT

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:04.439
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO.

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:06.507
BENEFIT FROM SOMEBODY RENTING SO

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:07.442
THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO PAY

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.110
THEIR TAXES AND INSURANCE AND

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.912
THAT THE PRINCIPAL ON THE LOANS.

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.447
AT CONTACT YOUR CITY PLANNING

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:14.148
DEPARTMENT. YOU'LL FIND OUT WHAT

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:16.117
THE PERMITTING IS HOW HOW LONG

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.452
DOES IT TAKE YOU TO GET PERMITS

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.253
TO GO THROUGH. LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.521
SIZE EIGHTY YOU IS THAT YOU CAN

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:22.356
BUILD ON YOUR PROPERTY AND- AND

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.158
CAN YOU DO A MODULAR HOME NOT

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:25.560
EVERYBODY CAN DO THAT BECAUSE

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:26.728
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SPACE TO

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.563
GET. THE MODULAR PIECES IN AND

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:29.697
THEY'D HAVE TO USE A CRANE TO GO

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:31.032
OVER THE BACKYARDS WE'VE SEEN

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.533
SOME OF THAT AND PALO ALTO

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.868
BECAUSE THE- THE PROPERTY LINES

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.903
ARE SO CLOSE. I DISCUSS

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.472
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.307
WITH. YOUR EYES I SPOKE EARLIER

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:42.009
ABOUT- USING- THAT WE WORKED

YOU WITH THE PERMITS. THEY

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:49.984
DEFINITELY MANAGE THE PROJECT.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.219
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:52.587
THEY ALSO OFFER LANDLORD

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:54.355
TRAINING SO. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.290
HAVE NEVER YOU KNOW HAD OWNED A

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:57.525
RENTAL PROPERTY BEFORE AND THEY

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:58.826
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.328
A TENANT HOW DO YOU SEARCH FOR

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.429

ALONG THOSE LINES SO THAT'S-

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:05.900
WHAT SOME OF THOSE OTHER

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.835
RESOURCES CAN HELP WITH THAT-

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:10.605
EFFORT ALSO. EPA CAN'T DO EAST

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:13.040
PALO ALTO CAN'T IT WAS ANOTHER-

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.108
GROUP THAT'S DOING THE SAME

01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:15.443
THING AS HELLO HOUSING AND IT'S

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.545
DONE IN EAST PALO ALTO. AND

CONCERN THAT LENDERS CAN EASILY

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:50.698
MITIGATE THE RISK THAT

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:52.967
CONSTRUCTION WILL GET DELAYED-

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:53.935
IN THIS THIS IS A CHALLENGE IN

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:57.505

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:01.776
BIT OF LEGISLATION YOU'RE DOING

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.311
SURE RADIOS ARE STREAMLINED AND

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:04.979
THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.981

WELL BUT WE'LL START WITH THIS

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:11.752
ONE- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.254
THINK WE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.922
ENSURE TAT STREAMLINING HAPPENS

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.724
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD AGAIN SOME

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.359
BILLS HAVE GONE INTO EFFECT THAT

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.260
HOPEFULLY WILL NOT MITIGATE

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.895
AGAINST THAT BUT- ANYTHING ELSE

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:24.298
WE CAN DO ON OUR END TO ENSURE

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:26.567
THE STREAMLINING. IS CONSISTENT

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:35.343
. FOR WHOEVER WANTS TO TAKE THAT. OKAY A TECHNOCRATIC ADDED- SO

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:36.777
I THINK I'D MENTIONED EARLIER

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.946
AND WHEN WILL YOU GET THAT

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:42.283
STREAMLINING IS ODD TO HAVE- YOU

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.251
KNOW HOW TO INCENTIVISE IN SOME

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:47.254
FASHION THESE FACTORY ROAD IN

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:49.623
OUR HOMES ARE ANALYZED- HOMES

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:50.791
THAT YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES I

01:33:50.858 --> 01:33:52.326
REALIZE THAT WE JUST MENTIONED

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.661
MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE TO HAVE A

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.563
FACTOR BUT- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.098
YOU OUT. IF YOU HAVE TO GET INTO

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:59.600
ONE OF ACCURACY OFFENSE RIGHT

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:01.702

HOMES MIGHT BE USEFUL AND MIGHT

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.310
WORK BETTER SO I THINK THAT IS

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:11.412
ONCE ONE AVENUE THAT YOU CAN

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.247

PRISON YEAH. BEGIN AGAIN. IS

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.326
NINE YOU KNOW GUYS COULD THINK

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:00.694
ABOUT POSSIBLY DOING SOMETHING

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.830

THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED CIVIL

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:34.495
ONE- TO MISS ELLINGTON- EDITING

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.496
YOUR PRESENTATION YOU SAID THAT

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.131
SO FAR YOU ALL FUNDED THREE HE

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:39.133
LOT CONSTRUCTION LOANS. I'M JUST

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.634
CURIOUS THE NUMBER SEEMS LOW

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:41.769
OBVIOUSLY THE PROGRAM JUST

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:42.970
STARTED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.071
TWENTY BUT IS IT. IS THE

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:44.839
CHALLENGE YOU'RE NOT GETTING

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:48.042
ENOUGH APPLICATIONS OR THAT IT'S

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.110
JUST STARTING DO YOU FORESEE IT

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.377
GETTING BIGGER. YEAH GREAT

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:52.546
QUESTION SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:55.516
AGAIN I. FEEL LIKE THE- PANDEMIC

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.252
SLOWED DOWN THE CONSTRUCTION. AT

01:35:58.319 --> 01:35:59.687
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:01.522
TO ACTUALLY START THAT THE

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:02.490
CONSTRUCTION BUILDING BUT I

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.058
DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.192
WITH US WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD QUITE

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:09.363
A FEW- THAT WE'VE HAD. AND APPLY

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.698
FOR THE LOAN IT'S JUST WE'VE

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.266
BEEN ABLE TO CONVERT THEM TO A

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:13.334
DIFFERENT TYPE OF LOAN THAT

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.201
SUITED THEM BETTER SO IT WAS

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:16.570
MORE COST EFFECTIVE. TO DO A

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.439
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:19.740
THEM SO WE ACTUALLY HAD PROBABLY

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.709
LIKE. I THINK CLOSE TO NINETEEN

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.944
I THINK OR TWENTY FIVE. NINETEEN

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:24.879
OF TWENTY IS SOMEWHERE AROUND

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.046
THERE LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:27.481
HAVE COME IN. BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:28.883
CONVERTED THE MEMBERS OVER

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:30.584
BECAUSE IT JUST MADE MORE SENSE

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.319
TO THEM FINANCIALLY NOT TO DO

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:33.554
THIS LOAN AND THEY DIDN'T NEED

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:36.490
THE- ADDITIONAL RENTAL- AND THEY

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:39.326
DID NOT NEED THAT RENTAL INCOME

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:40.895
THEY DIDN'T NEED THE ADDITIONAL

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:42.396
- PERCENTAGE TOO FOR THE LOAN

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.464
FOR THE LOAN TO VALUE SO DIDN'T

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.266
NEED TO GO 290% SO WE WERE ABLE

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:46.300
TO ACTUALLY MOVE THEM INTO A

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:47.868
BETTER PROGRAM WHICH- IS PART OF

01:36:47.935 --> 01:36:49.136
WHAT WE WANT TO DO ANYWAY WE

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.237
DON'T WANT TO PUT SOMEBODY IN

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.405
THIS LONG THAT'S A TWELVE MONTH

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.107
LONG TERM BECAUSE- IT DOES COST

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.175
THEM AT THE END TO DO A

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.976
REFINANCE AGAIN SO OUR GOAL FOR

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.711
OUR MEMBERS IS TO. SAVE THEM AS

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:46.313
US. WEEK AND NOW. SO THAT AND

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.815
THEN ORDER OF ONE TWENTY AND THE

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:48.916
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IT'S

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.551
PRETTY CLEAR THE FED IS GOING TO

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.419
BE INCREASING RATES. THIS YEAR

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:53.487
AND THAT'S GOING TO PUSH UP

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.356
BORROWING COSTS SO CASH OUT

THEY ARE ACTUALLY HAVE. ALREADY

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.762
IMPLEMENTED A LOT FROM THE FEET.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:04.131
AND SO I THINK I THINK THE LONG

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:06.700
AND SHORT OF IT IS THAT I THINK

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:07.601
FOR AS FAR AS POLICY MAKING IS

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:10.838
CONCERNED- YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:12.673
CONTROL INTEREST RATES OBVIOUSLY

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.641
AND SO I WOULD ACTUALLY SUGGEST

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.578
LOOKING AT A SOLUTION THAT

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:20.447
ALLOWS. THAT CAN REDUCES

01:40:20.514 --> 01:40:22.216
FRICTION IN ALL OF THESE

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:24.184
DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN DIFFERENT

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:27.287
PROGRAMS SO THAT IF THE INTEREST

RATE ENVIRONMENT IS MORE

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:30.124
CONDUCIVE FAR SAY HOME EQUITY

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.759
LENDING A HOMEOWNER THAT WANTS

01:40:31.825 --> 01:40:32.960
TO GO THAT ROUTE SHOULD BE ABLE

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:34.194
TO DO THAT. BECAUSE AN

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:35.929
INTERNSHIP IN MY MIND THAT

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.030

KNOW SOMETHING ELSE I THINK. WE

01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:43.170
HAVE TO THINK BROADLY AND REDUCE

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:45.406
THESE FRICTIONS ACROSS THESE

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.574

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:48.976
THAT THEY CAN BECOME YOU KNOW

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:51.011
WHY APPLE INTRACTABLE MOTORS

ABOUT WHATEVER WE DO. I'M TRYING

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:53.006
TO HELP PEOPLE- BUT AT THE END

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.474
OF THE DAY THE OWNER OF THE

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:55.675
PROPERTY HAS TO BE ABLE TO

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:57.577
HANDLE THE BURDENS OF. NOT ONLY

01:46:57.644 --> 01:46:59.179
THE LOANS ON THE PROPERTY AS

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.914
WELL AS ALL OF THE OTHER COSTS

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:05.118
AND THAT'S LONG TERM. AND- YOU

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:06.353
KNOW RESTRICTIONS ON LANE

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:08.288
LANDING THAT WE SEE THAT ARE

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.323
CAUSING OUR OUR PROBLEMS. ARE

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:12.559
BASED ON MASSIVE COLLAPSES THAT

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.194
HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST. IN

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:15.896
OTHER WORDS WE NEED TO LEARN A

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.197
LESSON WHAT HAPPENED IN TWO

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:19.432
THOUSAND EIGHT- I KNEW PEOPLE

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:22.235
THAT WERE BUYING HOMES FOR.

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:22.836
EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:24.771
IN AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR-

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:26.406
SALARIES THERE'S JUST NO WAY YOU

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.375
CAN A YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK.

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.876
AND YET SOMEHOW WE PUSH THEM

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:32.412
OVER THAT LINE. SO THERE'S THREE

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:33.680
THINGS WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:35.215
WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS.

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.751
ONE OF THEM IS IT'S KIND OF THE

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:38.718
HIPPOCRATIC OATH FIRST DO NO

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.554
HARM. WE NEED TO HELP WHERE WE

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:43.089
CAN BUT WE CAN'T FORCE A SQUARE

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:45.058
PEG IN A ROUND HOLE. SECOND

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.660
FOCUS ON LONG TERM SUCCESS

01:47:46.726 --> 01:47:48.829
BECAUSE- THE SHORT TERM

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:50.664
NAVIGATION OF GETTING APPROVED.

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.566
WE CAN TURN AND THIS IS A BIG

01:47:52.632 --> 01:47:54.734
FEAR OF MINE IS WE CAN TURN

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:55.635
THESE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:58.171
STRAPPED. INTO RENTER'S AGAIN.

EIGHTY USE AN INDIVIDUALLY HAVE

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:20.026
ACTUALLY GONE DOWN A FEW

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:22.529

TO HOLD BACK- AD USE- BUT- I

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.992

CALIFORNIANS TO ACTUALLY BUY
