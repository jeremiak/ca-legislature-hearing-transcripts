I'M CURRENTLY I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I'M A CO FOUNDER AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CAM AS FARMERS ASSOCIATION.

AND AS MENTIONED THERE IS CURRENTLY. NO REPRIEVE -- FOR FOLKS TRYING TO CARRY ON COMPASSIONATE PROGRAMS THEY CANNOT ESCAPE THE TAXATION -- AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN -- THIS IN COMBINATION WITH THE VAST REDUCTION OF SAFE ACCESS POINTS TO RETELL ENTITIES -- ALLOWED TO PROVIDE CANNABIS TO PATIENTS. HAS UNFORTUNATELY CREATED A CRISIS AMONGST -- PATIENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OVER THE PAST YEARS SERVING ON THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE HAVE HEARD REPEAT TESTIMONY FROM PATIENTS AND VETERANS AND COMPASSION GROUPS ABOUT THEIR INABILITY TO SERVE. THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND PARTICULARLY IT'S THE NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS -- SB THIRTY FOUR WOULD RECTIFY THE SITUATION BY ELIMINATING THE TAX ON HELPING TO MOVE THESE PROGRAMS FORWARD -- AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THESE PATIENTS THAT NEED THIS BILL TO PASS A DESPERATELY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS SEAN KERN AND I'M A SMALL PART OF THE WEEK FOR HIS PROJECT. WE ARE A GROUP OF VETERANS FIGHTING IN THE TRENCHES AND ADVOCATING. FOR OUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS TO HAVE A CHOICE TO MEDICATE WITH CANNABIS IN ORDER TO TREAT THEIR MILITARY TRAUMA AS AN ALTERNATIVE. TO THE COCKTAILS OF PHARMACEUTICALS CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED BY THE VA THAT ALL HAVE ADDICTION OVERDOSE AND SUICIDE AS STATED FTA RISK. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I FAILED TO MENTION THAT WE SUPPORT ACCESS TO CANNABIS FOR EVERYONE. SO WHILE WE ARE VETERANS REPRESENTING JUST 7% OF THE POPULATION WHO WEAR THAT TITLE WE ARE FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO CHOOSE WHAT MEDICINES. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO USE OR PUT INTO THEIR BODY. WE THE PROJECT -- HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT SB THIRTY FOUR AND WE URGE EVERY SENATOR HERE TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT. SB THIRTY FOUR IS AN ON RAMP TO CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL MARKET FOR THE SICK. DISABLED AND DISENFRANCHISED. UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR TO CALIFORNIA'S FOR CANNABIS HAVE BEEN CREATED. ONE FOR THOSE WITH DOLLARS AND RESOURCES WERE ABLE TO AFFORD THE TREMENDOUS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCING AND MEDICAID IMPROPERLY. AND THE OTHER THE ILLICIT MARKET WHERE THE SICK POOR AND DISENFRANCHISED HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TURN. IN THEIR HOPES OF AVOIDING OVERDOSE ADDICTION AND SUICIDE. HOUSE SO WE FOR WARRIORS CONFRONTING THIS EPIDEMIC HEAD ON THE WEED FOR WARRIORS CONDUCTS MONTHLY MEETINGS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. VETERANS SPEND THEIR MEETINGS AND JOIN THE CONNECTIONS THAT ANY BETTER WILL TELL YOU THEY MISS. THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THESE MEETINGS IS DISTRIBUTE CANNABIS TO QUALIFIED VETERANS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PURCHASE THEIR MEDICINE. VA NOR INSURANCE COVERS MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND FOR A 100% DISABLED VETERAN THE THREE THOUSAND A RECEIVING MONTHLY DISABILITY PAYMENTS DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE COST OF LIVING. LET ALONE DISCRETIONARY INCOME TO COVER CANNABIS VIA THE LEGAL MARKET. AS THE BETTER LEADERS BEHIND YOU ABOUT THE MEETINGS THEY SEE VETERANS AT THEIR MEETINGS GRACIOUSLY ACCEPT THEIR BROWN BAG OF DONATIONS. THE PEER INSIDE TO SEE FLOWER DONATED BY GROWERS WHEELS DONATED BY MANUFACTURERS VAPORIZERS DONATED BY ENTREPRENEURS AND LOS IN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT B. T. SWEAR BY. SMILES PERMEATE THE FACES SPOUSES ARE HAPPY KNOWING THEIR MOM AND DAD'S ARE HAPPY. THESE DAYS ARE GOOD DAYS A DAY THAT IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING A THING OF THE PAST FOR THESE VETERANS. UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR ALMOST ALL DONATIONS THE WEED FOR YEARS PROJECT HAS HISTORICALLY RECEIVED ARE OUTLAWED WITH GREAT PERSONAL RISK TO ALL THOSE INVOLVED. IN DISCUSSION WITH WE FORCE HISTORICAL DONORS. THAT ARE LICENSED OR PURSUING A LICENSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALL OF THEM FROM GROWERS TO MANUFACTURERS ARE NOW PRAGMATICALLY UNABLE TO DONATE MEDS OF ANY KIND. WE ASK THAT YOU IN THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OF CALIFORNIA STAND WITH US AND DEMAND SOME RELIEF FROM THE OVER REGULATION OF CANNABIS. WE OWE IT TO OUR VETERANS TO SEEK RELIEF FROM THE FORCE OF SERVICE WE OWE IT TO ALL OUR COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN SO DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED. BY OUR WAR AGAINST CANNABIS WE NEED TO Y. DOWN THE WAR WE HAVE AGAINST THE POOR AND THAT DOES NOT OCCUR. BY REGULATING AND TAXING A PIVOT AND LAW FORCING CROSSERS FROM EVERYONE TO SQUARELY IN SOLELY ON THE BACK OF THOSE NOT PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD ACTORS.

WE'RE GONNA GO BY THE SAME GROUND RULES THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED HERE THERE WERE LOSSES WERE STUCK IN A TRAFFIC JAM NO PROBLEM. TAKE A MOMENT [inaudible] HISTORY CLOCK. THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE WITH HIM YES CENTER WIENER WELCOME. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US. ON ON THIS BILL -- AND I WANNA KNOW US NOW SAID THE COMMITTEE DID MENTION SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AND ANALYSIS -- NOT THE POLICY MA'AM SO THIRTY ONE AND THEN SOME RAPID TO ACCEPT THOSE TECHNICAL MEMONS. MY COLLEAGUES US BILL TWO A ONE IS A LONG OVERDUE -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN INTERSEX ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. ABOUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THEIR OWN GENDER IDENTITY AND THEIR OWN BODIES. RATHER THAN HAVING PERMANENT. IRREVERSIBLE MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES PERFORMED ON WITHOUT THEM HAVING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST ABILITY TO HAVE ANY INPUT. ON TO WHETHER TO HAVE THOSE PERMANENT IRREVERSIBLE MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES. SURGERIES THAT MAY ASSIGN THEM A GENDER THAT IS NOT THEIR ACTUAL GENDER AND SURGERIES AND MAY HAVE PERMANENT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THEM LIFE. TO BE CLEAR SB TWO OH ONE IS NOT ABOUT REMOVING PARENTS WERE PHYSICIANS FROM THE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE SURGERY. WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS ENSURING THAT THE PERSON WHOSE BODY IS BEING OPERATED ON? IS ACTUALLY A PART OF THAT DECISION. BECAUSE THE BABY BY DEFINITION CANNOT BE PART OF THAT DECISION RIGHT NOW THE ONLY PERSON WHO IS INVOLVED IS A PERSON WHOSE BODY IS BEING PERMANENTLY CHANGE. THE PERSON WHO'S GENERAL'S WILL BE PERMANENTLY IN YOUR REVERSAL CHANGE. AND THE PERSON WHO MAY BE PERMANENTLY STERILIZED. MAY PERMANENTLY LOSE SEXUAL SENSATION OR MAY HAVE PERMANENT INCONTINENCE PROBLEMS THAT PERSON SHOULD HAVE PARTICIPATION AND A SAY. IN THEIR FUTURE. ALL WE'RE ASKING COLLEAGUES. IS THAT THE PERSON WHO'S BEING OPERATED ON BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN IT'S NOT SIMPLE. AND TO BE CLEAR. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES. SURGERIES THAT CAN BE SAFELY DEFERRED THE BILL IS VERY CLEAR THAT IF THE SURGERY IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR EXAMPLE IF A CHILD CANNOT URINATE. THAN THE SURGERY OF COURSE MAY AND SHOULD BE PERFORMED. ON THAT BABY. SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY. SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. MEDICAL PRACTICE IN MANY CASES HAS BEEN TO PERFORM POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SEX ASSIGNMENT AND QUOTE ON QUOTE NORMALIZATION ARE SURGERY. ON THE SEX CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERSEX BABIES. IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM APPEAR QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL. THERE IS NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE VERY PERSONAL DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE BY DOCTORS AND PARENTS SO EARLY IN LIFE. AND THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH INDICATING THE SUCH PROCEDURES CAN HAVE DEVASTATING LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES. WE ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWING DOCTORS AND PARENTS TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND WE WANT THE CHILDREN TO BE INVOLVED. I WANT TO BE ALSO VERY CLEAR -- WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE SOME OF THE BEST. DOCTORS IN THE WORLD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I AM PARTICULARLY PROUD OF YOU SEE US OUT IN MY DISTRICT. THIS IS NOT ABOUT AN ATTACK ON THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. PHYSICIANS SAVE LIVES EVERY SINGLE DAY IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. AND I HAVE ON MANY CASES MANY SITUATIONS BEEN ALLIED TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION INCLUDING ON SOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES. YOUR DOCTORS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. IN FACT WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND SEXUAL MINORITIES THERE IS A NOT SO PRETTY HISTORY. SOME PHYSICIANS USED TO PERFORM LOBOTOMIES ON LGBT CHILDREN. TO QUOTE UNQUOTE FIX THEM AND MAKE THEM QUOTE UNQUOTE NORMAL. SOME PHYSICIANS USED TO PERFORM ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY. ONE LGBT PEOPLE TO QUOTE ON QUOTE FIX AND NORMALIZE THEM. POSITIONS IN CALIFORNIA SOME. USED TO PERFORM CONVERSION THERAPY ON OUR LGBT CHILDREN TO FIX QUOTE UNQUOTE AND NORMALIZE THEM BEFORE WE BANDED. WITH BAND FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND STERILIZATION OF MINORS FOR SIMILAR REASONS. OVERWHELMINGLY WE SHOULD DEFER TO PHYSICIANS MEDICAL JUDGMENTS. ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. BUT NOT ALWAYS. AND THERE ARE RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE MEDICAL PRACTICES CAN VIOLATE OUR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AS A SOCIETY AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE ACTION? THE MEDICAL PROFESSION CONTRARY TO WHAT. HAS BEEN EXPRESSED. IS NOT UNIFIED HERE. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PHYSICIANS TWO OF THEM ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY. STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE POSITION. THAT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TAKEN. ON THIS BILL AND ON THIS ISSUE -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST RANK AND FILE PHYSICIANS WHO HOLD THIS VIEW. IN SUPPORT OF SB TO A ONE INDEED YOU ALL SHOULD RECEIVE A JOINT STATEMENT FROM THREE FORMER US SURGEON GENERAL. ONE OF POINT IN BY GEORGE W. BUSH TO APPOINTED BY BILL CLINTON [inaudible] CATEGORICALLY. CATEGORICALLY REJECTING THE SURGERIES. QUOTE WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS BORN AND I'M READING FROM THE STATEMENT. WHEN INDIVIDUAL IS BORN WITH A TYPICAL GENITALIA THAT POSE NO PHYSICAL RISK? TREATMENT SHOULD FOCUS NOT ON SURGICAL INTERVENTION BUT ON CYCLE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT [inaudible] QUOTE. BECAUSE MEDIC JANITOR PLASTI SHOULD BE DEFERRED UNTIL CHILDREN ARE OLD ENOUGH TO VOICE THEIR OWN VIEW. ABOUT WHETHER TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY. QUOTE THOSE WHOSE OATH OR CONSCIOUS SAY DO NO HARM SHOULD HE THE SIMPLE FACT THAT TO DATE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORT THE PRACTICE. OF COSMETIC INFANT GENERAL PLASTIC. THESE ARE THREE FORMER SURGEON GENERAL. THE UNITED NATIONS REPORT ON TORTURE. STATES QUOTE CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN WITH A TYPICAL SEX% CHARACTERISTICS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO YOUR REVERSIBLE SEXIST SIMON. INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION INVOLUNTARY GENITAL NORMALIZING SURGERY. PERFORMED WITHOUT THEIR INFORMED CONSENT OR THAT OF THEIR PARENTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO QUOTE FIX THEIR SOCKS. LEAVING THEM WITH PERMANENT IRREVERSIBLE INFERTILITY AND CAUSING SEVERE MEDICAL SUFFERING. THE US STATE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE A SIMILAR STATEMENT. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH GROUP SEPARATE TACT HUMAN RIGHTS IN THIS WORLD. HAVE TAKEN THE SAME POSITION. COLLEAGUES. I EXPRESSED TO THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL EARLY ON MY DESIRE TO WORK WITH THEM. TO TAKE FEEDBACK WITH A BILL. THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. THEY HAVE STEADFASTLY TOLD ME NO THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH YOU ARE NEGOTIATING WITH YOU ON THIS BILL WE ARE SIMPLY CATEGORICALLY OPPOSED. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT OF COURSE TO TAKE THAT POSITION AND I'M NOT CRITICIZING THEM FOR REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE WITH US. BUT OUR ROLES LEGISLATORS SOMETIMES IS TO FORCE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND BY VOTING THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. THAT WILL FORCE THIS LONG OVERDUE CONVERSATION. SO I ASK YOU TO ALLOW THAT CONVERSATION TO PROCEED AND AFTER THIS VERY VERY FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING ON THIS BILL. RATHER THAN. SHUTTING IT OFF TODAY. ALSO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. A WITH ME TODAY OR KIMBERLY'S IS SOMEONE WHO IS AN INTERSEX PERSON AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INTERACT -- ADVOCATES FOR INTERSEX YOUTH -- DOT DOCTOR I LEAN ONE GREGORIO -- A UROLOGIST A SURGEON AND A BOARD MEMBER OF INTERACT. WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY DOCTOR SCOTT NASS WHO IS A FAMILY PHYSICIAN FROM PALM SPRINGS AND THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF GL IN MAY WHICH WAS FORMALLY CALLED THE GAY AND LESBIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED. BY TOMMY MARTIN FROM A QUALITY -- CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY GOOD THE CENTER WINNER THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING ON THE BILL WELCOME TO THE WITNESSES WE HAVE SIX MINUTES COLLECTIVELY HELP YOU GUYS ORGANIZE YOURSELF. WE ARE LOOKING TO BEGIN ANYWAY YOU WANT. HI. MY NAME IS KIMBERLY DIESEL MEN AND I AM A LAWYER. A PARENT AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INTERACT ADVOCATES FOR INTERSECTS YOU. I'M ALSO AN INTERSEX WOMAN. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP INTERSEX TRAITS WERE KEPT SECRET AT ALL COSTS? I LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT MY BODY AT AGE. FORTY ONE AFTER DOCTORS LIED TO ME AND MY FAMILY FOR DECADES. WHILE ADMITTEDLY SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED FOR KIDS LIKE ME. MANY THINGS HAVEN'T. BODIES LIKE MINE HAVE EXISTED THROUGHOUT HISTORY WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR SURGERY. IT WAS A FEAR OF GAY AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE THAT LED TO THE FIRST INTERVENTIONS ON A TYPICAL GENITALIA. WOMEN WITH LARGE **** IS WHERE PRIMARY CONCERN. FOR FEAR THAT THEY WOULD PURSUE LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THIS PRACTICES HISTORICAL ROOTS. IN SEXISM AND HOMOPHOBIA. JUST AS LGBT PEOPLE FOUGHT AGAINST BEING CLASSIFIED AS MENTAL DISORDERS. INTERSEX PEOPLE PEOPLE FIGHT AGAINST BEING CLASSIFIED AS PHYSICAL DISORDERS. I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE? WHEN THEY LEARNED THEIR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION WHAT'S CAUSED BY INFANT HYPOSPADIAS SURGERY? I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR YOUTH WHO HAVE LOST SEXUAL SENSATION TO INFANT CLITORAL REDUCTIONS. AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WEAR DIAPERS FOR INCONTINENCE BECAUSE OF INFANT. VAGINOPLASTY IS. FRANKLY WHAT HURTS THE MOST IS NOT THE PHYSICAL PAIN BUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WERE ROBBED OF OUR OWN MOST INTIMATE CHOICES. IF OPPONENTS CLAIM THIS IS NO LONGER HAPPENING. IT'S BECAUSE THEIR OWN DEFINITION OF INTERSEX IS INTENTIONALLY NARROW. A RECENT PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST BY INTERACTIONS THAT OVER FOUR THOUSAND SUCH SURGERIES WERE REIMBURSED BY MEDICARE ALL IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. WITH PROCEDURES TO RELOCATE IN ALREADY FUNCTIONAL URETHRA. AND TO CREATE OR ALTER OF THE JOURNAL OPENING AMONG THE MOST COMMON. WELL NOT EVERYONE USES THE TERM INTERSECTS FOR MYSELF AND FOR MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THE YOUTH THAT I OVERSEE. IT HAS BECOME A GUIDING LIGHT A RECLAMATION THAT OUR BODIES OUR OWN. THE WORLD HAS HELPED THE WORD HAS HELPED US HEAL FROM MEDICAL TRAUMA. AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE NOT BROKEN. REGARDLESS OF TERMINOLOGY CHILDREN WITH VARIATIONS OF THEIR SEX STRAITS. DESERVES TO BE CENTERED. IN THIS IRREVERSIBLE DECISION ABOUT THEIR OWN BODY THANK YOU. MY NAME IS EILEEN LONG I'M A STAND FOR TRAINED UROLOGIST AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT INTERSECTS CARE I ONE OF THE GREATEST ETHICAL FAILURES OF MODERN MEDICINE. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY PROTECTS MINORS FROM THE HARMS OF CONVERSION THERAPY STERILIZATION AND FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION BUT MOST MODIFICATIONS TO NORMALIZE INTERSECTS ANATOMY ARE SOMEHOW STILL CONDONED DESPITE SIMILAR RISKS. DATA SUPPORTING THESE PROCEDURES IS NOTORIOUSLY POOR QUALITY IN CENTERS PARENTAL PERCEPION IN COSMETIC OUTCOMES NOT PATIENT EXPERIMENTSEXPERIENCE AND FUNCTION. THESE FIRST FOUR PROCEDURES ARE ALL PERFORMED ON THE IASED AN UNPROVEN ASSUMPTION THAT MEETING SOCIAL GENDER NORMS WILL JUSTIFY INTENSE MEDICAL RISKS FOR ALL PATIENTS. MANY CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP WITH DECREASE IN STATION OR NORGAY ORGASMIC FUNCTION AND A MAJORITY OF INFANT VAGINOPLASTY IS REQUIRED INVASIVE FOLLOW UP SURGERIES. THESE FEMINIZING PROCEDURES ARE MOST COMMONLY DONE IN PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF NATIONAL GENERAL DIFFERENCE YET DATA SHOWED THAT UP TO ONE EIGHTH OF THESE PATIENTS DO NOT IDENTIFY AS FEMALE. MY DUTY AS A PHYSICIAN IS TO DO NO HARM TO MY PATIENTS. WHEN THE FDA ISSUED A WARNING ABOUT A VAGINAL MESS PRODUCT AFTER ONLY 5210% OF PATIENTS COMPLAIN I ADJUSTED MY PRACTICE? BY COMPARISON DISSATISFACTION RATES FOR SOME PROCEDURES SB TWO ONE COVERS ARE CITED AS 4250%. IF INTEREST TAX SURGERY WERE MEDICAL DEVICE THE FDA WOULD NEVER HAVE APPROVED IT. CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME ADULTS WHO ARE SATISFIED THAT THESE CHOICES WERE MADE FROM THEM BUT THE RISKS ARE TOO HIGH TO GAS WHICH BABIES WILL BE WHICH MANY OF THE ADULTS HARM BY THESE INTERVENTIONS FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO FIND DOCTORS TO CARE FOR THEM AFTER THE EIGHT OUT OF PEDIATRICS AND I HAVE TO SAY IN MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS MEDICAL ABANDONMENT. WHAT MULTI DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT TEAMS DO EXIST THEY ARE STILL RARE AND LACKED THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION MAKER? THE PATIENT. THE ONLY WAY TO DO NO HARM IS TO WAIT AND LET THOSE WHO MAY WANT SURGERIES TO PERSONALLY WAY IN. WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO TOLERATE? AS MANY INTERSECTS AND TRANSGENDER CHILDREN SO WEST GENITALIA CHROMOSOMES CANNOT RELIABLY INDICATE HOW CHILD IDENTIFY THEIR GENDER OR WHAT SURGERIES THEY MAY OR MAY NOT WANT. SB TO A ONE WILL STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS REGARDING ITS SCOPE CENTERS INDIVIDUAL CONSENT AND PRESERVES OPTIONS FOR CHILDREN THE PATIENTS WE ARE TREATING. I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL MEANT -- TO HAVE FLOWN FROM PHILADELPHIA AND AND WOULD BE TAKING A RED EYE HOME TOMORROW AN OPERATING FULL DAY. BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE INTERSEX BODIES WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR PRACTICE. THANK YOU TAMMY MARTIN WITH EQUALITY CALIFORNIA SPONSOR OF SB TO A ONE WHICH AT ITS CORE IS ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S AUTONOMY OVER THEIR OWN BODY. AND IN SOME CASES GENDER IDENTITY WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL THE WORK THATWE DO ON LGBT Q. RIGHTS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP BECAUSE THE SITUATION TODAY IS NOT MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY SURGERIES THAT CAUSE LONG LASTING AND PERMANENT HARM ARE BEING PERFORMED ON CHILDREN WITHOUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT OR CONSENT. WHICH IS A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION. AND THAT'S WHY WE STAND WITH SENATOR WIENER AND SPONSORING THE THIS BILL AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL.

ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE ONE INVITE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WE DID HAVE A CLOCK RUNNING SO IT'S ABOUT -- WONDER SEVEN MINUTES FOR YOU COLLECTIVELY AND WE WELCOME YOU AND PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU -- I DR KELLY SORTS OF A PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST FROM RATED CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN SAN DIEGO. ADRIAN MARKS I HAVE CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA AND I HAD GENITAL SURGERY AT A EARLY AGE AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LGBT PLUS COMMUNITY. THE PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGIST PRACTICING AT UC DAVIS AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS WELL. AUTHORED ANSWER COULD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- THIS LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND AS A FELLOW I HELPED CREATE -- THE DIFFERENCES AND SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION -- CLINIC AT THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY CLINIC AT MY INSTITUTION AND I PRACTICE AT RADIO AND WE HAVE THIS IS VERY SIMILAR MULTI DISCIPLINARY CLINIC -- ON BEHALF OF MYSELF YOUR LOGIC COMMUNITY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SPECIALIST TO TREAT THESE PATIENTS WE'RE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB TO A ONE WELL MY TITLE MIGHT BE PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST I AM FIRST AND FOREMOST. A PATIENT ADVOCATE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS INCLUDES MAKING INDIVIDUALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH PATIENT BY EDUCATING FAMILIES SO THEY CAN ACT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HEALTHCARE IS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL EACH PERSON I INTERACT WITH DESERVES YOU NEED CARE THIS CRAFTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM. SB TWO OH ONE JUST DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE AND TREATS EVERY CHILD THE SAME IGNORING THE IMPACT OF DELAYED TREATMENT. IS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE LAWMAKERS WHO ARE AIMING TO PROTECT CHILDREN. AND UNITED WITH YOU IN THIS ENDEAVOR. SB TWO ONE IT'S BROAD DEFINITION OF INTERSEX THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE UNPRECEDENTED DEFINITION OF INFORMED CONSENT THAT IS UNWORKABLE. AND VISITED LEFT THE PROVISIONS THAT HINDER A MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ABILITY TO RECOMMEND CARES ALARMING. THE BILL RESULT IN CHILDREN BE EXPOSED TO MORE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PAIN AND IN THE LONG RUN LIKELY RESULT IN INCREASED NUMBER OF SURGERIES NEEDED. FOR EXAMPLE HYPERSPACE THE HYPE IS BDS IS COMMON IT OCCURSIN APPROXIMATELY ONE IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOYS IT IS NOT AN INTERSEX CONDITION. IN SIMPLE TERMS TYPE THE SPEEDIEST IS WHEN THE WHOLE THAT AVOID PIECE FROM IS NOT ON THE TIP OF THE **** BUT LOWER ON THE SHAFT. THE H. ALSO ON THE BILL IS ALSO NOT AN INTERSEX CONDITION. THESE PATIENTS ARE GENETICALLY MALE AND FEMALE AND DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES -- SEX. LAST MONTH I VOLUNTEERED N GHANA THE TEACHING PERFORM HYPOSPADIAS SURGERY. THERE NO PEDIATRIC UROLOGIST IN WESTERN AFRICA WEST AFRICA THEIR FOUR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THEIR DOCTORS TRAVEL FROM FAR TO COME AND SEE OF CS. MANY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS FOR THEIR SURGERY. MOST WERE MUCH OLDER THAN THE AVERAGE SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS OF AGE THAT WE PERFORM SURGERIES ON IN THE UNITED STATES. I GOT TO SEE THEIR INCREASED PAIN POPS DISHES WITH ERECTIONS AND EXTREME DISCOMFORT WITH CATHETERS FIRST HAND DESPITE THIS THESE YOUNG MEN REMAIN THANKFUL THAT THEY WOULD FINALLY BE ABLE TO HAVE STRAIGHT OR ACTIONS AND PEE STANDING UP. AND NOW I CONTINUE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE GUARDIAN UROLOGIST THESE OLDER BOYS ARE HEALING MORE POORLY. THAN THEIR YOUNGER COUNTERPARTS IN A LARGER NUMBER WILL NEED A SECOND SURGERY TO FULLY CORRECT THEIR HIVE SPEEDIEST SURGERY. SB TWO OH ONE PUTS CALIFORNIA BOYS AT RISK THE SAME COMPLICATIONS. FRIEDMAN OF DST HAS CHANGED ADVANCE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL SITE CASES FROM THIRTY PLUS YEARS AGO AS JUSTIFICATION TO PASS THIS BILL. I SYMPATHIZE DEEPLY WITH THESE PATIENTS THAT WERE TREATED IN THIS ERA. HOWEVER WE NOW TAKE A TEAM CARE APPROACH THE PROVIDES FAMILIES RESOURCES AND CHOICES. AND MANY CASES SURGERY IS NOT OFFERED IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE OPTIONS THE S. B. TWO OH ONE REMOVES. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SPENT ONE AND A HALF YEARS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWING ALL THE DATA FROM BOTH SIDES RELATED TO DST. AND THE ESTABLISHED THE COULD NOT SUPPORT A MORATORIUM ON GENERAL SURGERY FOR PATIENTS WITH THE SD. TWO YEARS LATER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELEVEN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT RANGE FROM PSYCHIATRY ENTER CANNELLA G. STATURE THINKON ECOLOGY UROLOGY AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ADVANCING LGBT EQUALITY REVIEW THE DATA AS WELL AND JOINED IN SUPPORTING THE AMA ITS POSITION. WELL I UNDERSTAND THE SENATOR'S INTENT WITHHOLDING TREATMENT OPTIONS AND TREATING CHILDREN AS IF THEY'RE ONE SIZE FITS ALL WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THESE PATIENTS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. SENATE BILL TO A ONE IS THE WRONG APPROACH AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GLAZER AND FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ADRIAN MARKS I AM A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD NURSE PRACTITIONER FROM NAPA CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBT PLUS COMMUNITY AND AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD GENITAL SURGERY AT A YOUNG AGE. SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION SENATE BILL TO A ONE WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF BEING BORN I WAS TRANSFERRED TO INTENSIVE CARE. MY PARENTS SOON LEARNED I WAS BORN WITH A RARE ADRENAL GLAND CONDITION CALLED CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA OR C. H.. IN THOSE FIRST FEW DAYS MY BODY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE. AND IT WAS KNOWN MY LIFE WOULD NOT BE EASY. NOT ONLY WHAT I HAVE TO TAKE MEDICATION THREE TIMES A DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE TO LIVE. I WAS ALL I WOULD ALSO FACE THE CHALLENGES OF BEING BORN WITH GENITALIA THAT WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL. DUE TO C. H. I WAS EXPOSED TO AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF MALE HORMONES WHILE IN THE WOMB. AS A GENETICALLY BORN FEMALE THIS BECAUSE MY VAGINAL CANAL TO FUSE EXTERNALLY AND CONNECTS WITH MY URINARY TRACT. I HAD GENERAL SURGERY AT THE AGES OF ONE AND FOR TO OPEN MY VAGINAL CANAL AND REPOSITION MY MY **** CHOPPED OFF OR CUT. AND TODAY I DO HAVE A HEALTHY SEX LIFE. SURGERY WAS NOT INTENDED TO MAKE ME HETEROSEXUAL OR CHANGE MY GENDER. INSTEAD SURGERY REDUCE NUMEROUS URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS AND PREVENTED ME FROM STARTING MY PERIOD THROUGH A SMALL URINARY OPENING. WHICH WOULD HAVE LEFT ME IN PAIN AND TREMENDOUS EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. SB TWO OH ONE IS AMBIGUOUS AND ITS LANGUAGE REGARDING MEDICAL NECESSITY AND AGE OF CONSENT. FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS IN PLACE WHEN I WAS BORN. THE ADVICE OF MY DOCTORS WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENCED. I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO START KINDERGARTEN KNOWING I WOULD WET MY PANTS AT SCHOOL BECAUSE I COULD NOT CONTROL WHEN TRAPPED YOUR AND PULLING IN MY ACCORDING TO SB TWO OH ONE MY SURGERIES WHAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE WEDDING MYSELF UNCONTROLLABLY IS NOT DISABLING OR CAUSING SEVERE PAIN. AND IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE MY OWN PERSONAL TRAUMA BECAUSE THIS BILL STATES PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS DO NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL NECESSITY. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STORIES OF HARDSHIP AND PAIN OF THE TRUE INTERSEX PEOPLE EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR THEIR VOICE. YES SB TWO OH ONE WAS ORGANIZED WITHOUT HEARING THE VOICE OF THE C. H. COMMUNITY. I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO C. H. WOMEN WHO HAD SURGERY EARLY AND SOME WHO HAD SURGERY LATE. BOTH SIDES TOLD ME THEY DO NOT WANT THIS BILL. I AM NOT A SURGERY ADVOCATE BUT I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS THE WRONG ANSWER TO A VERY COMPLEX MATTER. I BELIEVE BUNCHING OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS WHEN THEY'RE ALL DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT AND EACH PERSON IS UNIQUE IS CARELESS. PERCY H. THERE MAY NEVER BE A PERFECT ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS A HEART CONDITION TO LIVE WITH. BUT I KNOW SENATE BILL TWO OH ONE WOULD HAVE CREATED ADDITIONAL HARDSHIPS FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. I KNOW A BILL THAT BLOCKS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ASSUMES EVERY PERSONIS THE SAME AND DISCREDITS MENTAL HEALTH. WOULD HAVE MADE MY LIFE WORSE. PLEASE VOTE NO ON SENATE BILL TO A ONE THANK YOU ADRIN THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR STORY. WE HAVE EXCEEDED THE TIME THAT'S BEEN A LOT IT IF THERE'S A QUICK SUMMARY THAT YOU LIKE TO MAKE IT YOUR TESTIMONY OR OR YOUR CREDENTIALS AND AND MEMBERS MAY HAVE QUESTIONS SURE -- I THINK THAT'S MY RICK MINERAL ANYWAY I'M A PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGIST AT UC DAVIS AND I'D LIKE TO BE HERE JUST ANSWER ANY COME HOME QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE VERY COMPLICATED BIOLOGY.

A WHAT YEAR OLD A WEEK LD WITH ELEVEN HUNDRED SIGNATURES OPPOSING THE BILL. VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN ON WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE JUST FIRST THANK ALL THE WITNESSES WHO OF COMMON. IN FAVOR AND AGAINST A SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS WITH US ON A VERY. VERY DIFFICULT TOPIC AS I THINK ALL OF US WHO HAVE LOOKED INTO IT. HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND -- I WANT TO BRING THE ISSUE BACK -- TO MY COMMITTEE. MANY QUESTIONS THAT THAT THEY MAY HAVE. HAVE QUESTIONS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE ARE READY LIKE TODAY HI MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OF ALL -- I I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TELLING THEIR PERSONAL STORIES ON BOTH SIDES I THINK THAT -- YEAH VERY IMPORTANT. TO YOU KNOW TO DO HERE I ALSO WOULD LIKE -- TO JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT EXCEPTION WAS SENATOR WINNERS COMMENTS AT ALL THE OPPOSITION DIDN'T WANT TO NEGOTIATE OR DO ANYTHING I'VE. MADE IT CLEAR TO THE BILL'S SPONSOR THAT I THOUGHT EDUCATION. WAS SOMETHING PROVIDING -- TO TO THE PARENTS -- INFORMATION -- FROM EQUALITY CALIFORNIA -- IT FOR EVERY SINGLE PATIENT -- THAT THAT MAY HAVE THIS CONDITION BECAUSE I THINK EDUCATION IS KNOWLEDGE IN PARTICULAR IT'S THE CALIFORNIA THANK. AS WE'VE KNOWN THAT PEOPLE ARE -- ARE ARE MORE OPEN EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I THINK BILL. WILL DO THE RIGHT THING BASED ON BLB AN EDUCATED AND YEAH WHY DO HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR CENTER WIENER AND ALSO EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. IN ALL ALL CONTINUE TO LISTEN AS I'M SITTING HERE TODAY BUT TAKING -- THAT SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW I HAVE. NINE GRANDKIDS AND I JUST. JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY. OF TWO ADULTS THAT ARE OPEN MINDED. TO BE EDUCATED -- IT'S A I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T DO WHAT YOU THINK IS THE BEST IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR DOCTOR WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER. BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID SO -- I I'M. JUST VERY VERY -- CONFLICTED BY THAT WHOLE THING YET. I DO SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE. SOMETHING -- IS NECESSARY TO DO HERE I JUST DON'T THINK WE'VE FOUND THE SWEET SPOT AND I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. IF THIS DOESN'T GO THROUGH TODAY TO TRY TO FIND WHAT THAT'S WEAK SPOT IS. THANK YOU US UNDER GOD -- SENATOR PAN. THANKS VERY MUCH -- THE FIRST FIVE ONE THANKS CENTER WINNER FOR HIS -- HIS WORK IN THIS AREA I THINK WHAT WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK AND I WAS. PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION -- I DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE BASICALLY WE ARE SAYING WITH THIS BILL -- AND I THINK THERE I THINK THAT IT HAS BEEN REYES THE OTHERS ALSO SOME -- I GUESS IS WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT CLARIFICATION AS WELL BUT THAT BASICALLY A PHYSICIAN'S LICENSE WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY FOR WORKING WITH THE PARENTS AND AND AND AND AND AND BASICALLY AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST YOU KNOW THE STANDARD. BASICALLY TRAVEL THE BEST SANTA KERR AND I THINK IN A AND ACTUALLY I A AGREE THAT. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHERE THE TRYING TO ENGAGE THE CHILD ALL RIGHT -- IT IS IDEAL -- AND DO THAT WHEN POSSIBLE WE SHOULD TRY TO DO THAT SO I THINK THE THE GOAL OF THE GOALS THAT YOU'RE TRYING -- TO YOU IN THE SPONSOR TO TRY TO ACHIEVE AYE AYE SUPPORT -- BUT I FEEL THAT THIS FILLED THE MECHANISM IS UNFORTUNATELY ONE THAT HAS THINK HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT -- CONSEQUENCES IN THE END AND I WOULD JUST I MEAN WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT TO CLARIFY AND WE HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL SO. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ACTUALLY WELL WHEN THE OPPOSITION ARE ACTUALLY PARENTS AND FAMILIES OF OF CHILDREN WITH CONTROL YOUR HYPERPLASIA THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CALLS CALLS OUT PATIENTS WITH THAT CONDITION IF YOU HAD. WHAT'S YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT THAT THAT COMMUNITY -- SINCE THEY'RE ASSOCIATION AS OPPOSED IN TERMS OF TRYING -- TO TO ADDRESS THE THEIR CONCERNS. YEAH WE'VE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CARES FOUNDATION BUT FOUNDATION HAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HISTORY OF HOMOPHOBIA -- SO I DON'T KNOW WELL I AM VERY RESPECTFUL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OPINIONS ON THIS I DON'T. THAT'S DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF AN ASSOCIATION. ON BOTH SIDES THREE REALLY CLEAR. I'M NOT NONE OF US IS SAYING THAT EVERY PERSON WHO UNDERGOES THE SURGERY WHETHER IT'S FROM CH OR NOW OTHER SITUATIONS THAT EVERYONE. IS DISSATISFIED CLEARLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GLAD THAT THEY HAD THE SURGERY. BUT THE QUESTION AS ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO. AREN'T WHO EITHER WERE ASSIGNED THE WRONG GENDER. OR HAVE PERMANENT PROBLEMS AS A RESULT OF THE SURGERY. AND EVEN IF AND THERE ARE SOME DISPUTES ABOUT THE DATA BUT EVEN IF WE ASSUME. THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE SATISFIED -- DOES NOT JUSTIFY SUCH PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ASSIGNED THE WRONG GENDER OR PERMANENT. PROBLEMS -- AND IS THERE IN TERMS OF THE HARM. OF WAITING UNTIL A CHILD CAN EXPRESS FOR THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW GIVING INFORMED CONSENT WHICH A YOUNG CHILD CAN PROVIDE AND WE ADOPT EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW -- IN TERMS OF FOR CONSENT. WHAT YOU BALANCE THE HARMS? THIS IS NOT NO ONE SAYING THAT THIS IS ALL COMPLETELY CLEAN CUT IN ONE DIRECTION. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO'S BEING HARMED SO COULD CARRY A CLEAR FIGHT BECAUSE YOU SAID AND INFORMED CONSENT. WE DO ALLOW. TEENAGERS -- TO WHO ARE MAINSTAY MINERS AROUND BE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH BUT NOT YOUNGER THAN THAT. TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN GIVE CERTAINLY KNOWS A PEDIATRICIAN DALY ACCIDENTALLY ASTOR OPINIONS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A LEGAL STANDING TO PROVIDE CONSENT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DELAYING SURGERY UNTIL. UNTIL AGE FOURTEEN NOW WE'RE NOT SO HOW SO HOW WOULD THAT OPERATIONALIZE USABLE ON NOW SO THIS IS NOT JUST. YEAH I'M TALKING. PATIENTS AND WHAT DO YOU THINK AND YOUR EIGHT YEARS OLD I MEAN DOUBLE THE THIS IS LOST SO. YOUR CELL WERE. GOING TO BE ALLOWING WERE WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO BE. ENSURING THAT THE CHILD COULD NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEARCH SO HOW WELL DEVELOPMENTALLY WE'RE TALKING THEN ABOUT I THANK YOUNG. I THANK YOUNG CHILDREN OR AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE ARE VERY MUCH ABLE TO EXPRESS WHAT PARTICULARLY WHAT THEIR GENDER IS -- AND WHAT THEY WANT AND SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WAITING UNTIL KIDS OR TEENAGER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD BUT WE KNOW THAT A BABY CAN SAY ANYTHING -- AND OUT TO WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM MY WILL ALSO JUST. SAY SENATOR I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. THAT IF WE HAD. ANYONE TO NEGOTIATE WITH ON THIS AND RESPECTFULLY TO SENATOR DODD -- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- THE OWNER NOT ABOUT YOU AND TALK ABOUT THE OPPOSITE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT FIGHT IF MY PHRASING WAS -- DAY I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT FOR THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT HAS MADE CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH US. SO FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY OR INFORMED CONSENT THESE VARIOUS -- YOU WERE GET CRITICIZED FOR SAYING IT'S NOT IT'S NOT PRECISE ENOUGH FOR IS WRONG. AND I'M NOT OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE -- SAYING THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. BECAUSE SOME HAVE SUGGESTED INCLUDING MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A SPECIFIC AGE WHERE THE SURGERY CAN BE PERFORMED BECAUSE THE CHILD IS ABLE TO EXPRESS. AND WE MADE CLEAR THAT WERE OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT THEN ONE NEVER ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT NEGOTIATION IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WELL I I I THINK IT'S WELL I'M IN CHIRLA ALSO DISCUSS INTO DISARRAY THINK IT'S A BIT PROBLEMATIC. TO SAID THAT A LET'S SAY A SECURE OLDER EIGHT YEAR OLD. THAT THERE AND I THINK THIS BILL REQUIRES A SIGNATURE AND SOME OTHER THINGS. THAT GIVEN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL STAGING THAT. THAT WOULD HOLD UP. A SURLY AND THEN AND CORD OR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT PERHAPS AT A QUESTION FOR UROLOGIST I THINK WE HAD ENDOCRINOLOGIST HERE -- CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE THE HOT BUTTON WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE TRADE OFFS -- FOR WAITING TILL SOMEONE'S A TEENAGER. YES AT WITH I AM MOSTLY SURGERIES IS MORE PAIN FOR THE PATIENTS. A HIGHER RATE OF COMPLICATION -- A HIGHER RATE OF INFECTION WHEN KIDS GO THROUGH PUBERTY THINGS GET SWEATY DOWN THERE. AND THERE IS THIS IS DEFINITELY A HIGHER RATE OF INFECTION ALL THAT WE DO -- THERE'S A AND THEN A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD THAT THE ONLY TO SECOND SURGERY -- KIDS IT IN HAIFA STATUS THEY HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF THE HOLDEN TIP THE **** BECOMING THE AND SO I ACTUALLY JUST TO CLARIFY THOUGH I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEVERAL DIFFERENT -- YES. RIGHT ALL THESE INCREASED INFECTION INCREASED BLEEDING INCREASED PAIN -- BABIES OFTEN DON'T NEED NARCOTICS AFTER SURGERY -- WE HAVE AN OPIOID CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY -- EARLY EXPOSURE NARCOTICS LENDS ITSELF TO MORE DRUG USE TEENAGERS DO NEED NARCOTICS AFTER THE SURGERIES -- AND A POOR OUTCOMES REPEAT SURGERY -- ACROSS THE BOARD. OKAY AND THEN OF THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST THEN YOU'RE NOT SURGEON SO WHITE WEDDING ENDOCRINOLOGIST OPPOSED. STATE HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS. THE PROBLEM IN MY MIND IS THAT THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMPLICATED THERE'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED BIOLOGY SO THERE ARE MANY MANY MOLECULAR RAMON ALL GENETIC. PROBLEMS THAT CAN LEAD TO GENITAL DIFFERENCES AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN TREAT THEM ALL THE SAME. THAT'S MY MAIN OPPOSITION WE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DIAGNOSIS. AND FROM WORKING THERE -- IN TERMS OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT SOMETIMES. NOT OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES INVOLVE SURGERY. AND SO I DON'T LIKE THAT WE'RE TREATING EVERYTHING THE SAME. OKAY THANK YOU. THE SERVER DOCTOR WONG ALSO RESPOND TO THAT FOR SURE. I FIND IT A BIT SPUR YES -- FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO REMARK ON ON HOW ADULTS SURGERIES -- ARE MORE MORE CHALLENGING -- BECUSE THERE IS DOCUMENTED LITERATURE -- ON HOW CERTAIN IN CERTAIN HAND TYPE OF SPEEDIEST REPAIRS HAVE THE SAME. RESULTS -- IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN -- I HAVE A PAPER FROM WARREN SNODGRASS HERE I'M FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH SAYS EXACTLY THAT DESPITE POPULAR OPINION THAT IS THE CASE -- AND WE ALSO HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT -- PEDIATRIC UROLOGISTS ARE NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ALTER WHO OPERATE ON GENITALIA -- THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS A GROWING -- COALITION OF SURGEONS WHO ARE ABLE TO DO TEENAGE AND ADULT TRANSGENDER SURGERY -- IN THESE PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN BODIES -- AND WHO GO THROUGH SURGERIES IN OUT NO SURGERIES WITHOUT COMPLICATION WE ALL KNOW THAT -- BUT THAT'S TRUE ALSO OF INFERENCE SURGERIES WHERE THERE ARE I I'VE HAD STORE HEARD STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD BETUL PASSED HIS NERVE HAD THEIR PARENTS HAD TO DILATE THEM. WEEKLY UNTIL THEY THIRTEEN AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND PAIN. I I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN IGNORE THOSE STORIES AS WELL. OKAY BUT CLARIFY WE HEARD GUESTS YOU MUST IS ON YES -- FIVE THANK YOU FOR KNOWLEDGE AND JUST FIRST OFF -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SENATOR WIENER THE CARES FOUNDATION IS NOT HOME OF THICK I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE I WOULD GO TO THEM FAT FOR THEM SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. THANKS -- AND THEN THE SECOND PART IN TERMS THE NOTION AS I SAID IN MY IN MY STATEMENT. THAT. IT'S NOT THAT I'M FOR OR AGAINST SURGERY IT'S THE FACT THAT THIS IS SUCH A COMPLEX. MATTER THAT EITHER WAY IT'S A TOUGH CALL -- EITHER WAYS UNFORTUNATELY NO ONE'S GOING TO HAVE THE EXACT PERFECT OUTCOME BUT ASSUMING EVERYONE'S THE SAME AND AND NEGLECTING THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF POSSIBLY DELAYING SURGERY AT LEAST ALL I CAN SPEAK FOR CH -- BUT I'VE SPOKEN TO C. H. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SAID THAT WAITING. TILL EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN WAS THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER IMAGINE AND SOMETHING THEY WOULD NOT WISH ON THEIR WORST ENEMY. SO THE FACT THAT WE LIKE I SAID THAT IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT -- TO SIDE STEP ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HURT BUT I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG ANSWER TO A VERY VERY COMPLEX MATTER. I AGREE WITH ADRIAN. CENTER AT THE FINISH. OKAY WELL I DIED. I GUESS ONE LAST GOOD FOR THE P. R. KERALA JUST BECAUSE IT IS A SITE I I SUPPORTED THE RESOLUTION AND I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO THE LADY. SURGERY WHEN THEY HAVE WILL FOR ABLE -- TO THAT WHEN IT'S REASON-WAS THAT IT'S A COMPLEX DECISION AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE AND THE CHALLENGE HERE IS WE'RE TRYING TO LEGISLATE. PRACTICE MEDICINE AND THAT ALWAYS YOU KNOW AND EVEN WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS THAT OFTEN DOESN'T -- YEAH PEOPLE GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT. CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO WHERE IS THE PEDIATRIC UROLOGY COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE THE THE THE THE BROADER ISSUES ARE RAISED BY. A CENTER WINNER AND INTERSECTS COMMUNITY I ANY I THINK THEY DO HAVE A POINT -- IN TERMS OF% WHERE WE WILL TRY TO GET TO AYE AYE I'VE CONCERNS ABOUT LEGISLATING IT BUT BUT CAN BE PERHAPS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. HOUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT LEGISLATING MEDICINE -- THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH TIME EVEN WHEN IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS -- ALMOST EVERY MAJOR CENTER HAS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY CLINIC. ON REALLY AND THE NUMBERS WERE TALKING ABOUT TRUE DST PATIENTS TRUE INTERSEX PATIENCE IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE KIDS IN CALIFORNIA YEAR. AN ADMITTEDLY THOSE VERY COMPLEX PATIENTS. IT'S IT'S A HARD ANSWER WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT -- ONE I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- MY COLLEAGUES AND I IN THE WHERE I TRAINED FOR FELLOWSHIP AND EVEN WHERE I CAME FROM FOR RESIDENCY. SURGERY WHICH IS NOT THE IMMEDIATE ANSWER WE DON'T WANT TO BURN BRIDGES WE DON'T WANT TO DO THINGS TO KIDS THAT WE THAT CAN'T BE REVERSED -- THE SURGERIES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LARGELY TODAY ARE -- FOR NORMAL FUNCTION AND BETTER OUTCOMES MEDICALLY LIKE REDUCED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS -- AND AND WE DO THOSE THINGS NOT TO NORMALIZE -- A CHILD WE DO THOSE THINGS TO HELP THEM FUNCTION -- AND SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE TRUE DST CASES -- WHICH I THINK ARE ALSO IS ESTIMATED A HUNDRED SURGERIES IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES A YEAR. I'M YOU YOU -- THOSE ARE DIFFICULT I THINK EVERYONE'S GONNA ADMIT THAT BUT I THINK THE THING IS WE TRUST YOUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS TRUST YOUR STATE BOARD LICENSING PEOPLE THAT. IN THESE MULTI DISCIPLINARY CLINICS WERE IN A WORK TOGETHER. AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE BEST ANSWER -- EVERY SINGLE PHYSICIAN THAT I KNOW ON THE QUESTION I ALWAYS ASK EVERYBODY IS DO YOU COME TO THE HOSPITAL YOU COME THE HOSPITAL DATA DO. AM I GOOD HOSPITAL EVERY DAY TO HELP MY PATIENTS AND TO BE PERFECT AND TO TAKE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE AND IN CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT UNANIMOUS ANSWER EVERYWHERE. I MOVED PAEDIATRICIAN PAEDIATRIC PEOPLE WE GO INTO BECAUSE WE LOVE KIDS WE LOVE HUMANITY AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP THEM. AND PUTTING A BILL LIKE THIS THAT HIGHS ARE ARMS WE CAN'T EVEN GIVE ALL THE OPTIONS. ON LIKE I SAID BEFORE IT'S IT'S REALLY ALARMING -- BECAUSE PEOPLE DESERVE EDUCATION I A LIKE TEACH ONE REACH MANY. BUT WE SHOULD BE EDUCATING ALL THESE PEOPLE EVERYONE ABOUT DST ABOUT INTERSEX AND AND THAT'S HOW WE BECOME MORE ACCEPTING THAT'S HOW WE GET FURTHER THAT'S HOW WE ARRIVE. AT BETTER DECISIONS AND THAT'S HOW WE TAKE BETTER CARE OF ALL HUMANS -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT GAME. THAN IT WAS BEFORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THE YEAH A SENATOR HILL. I THINK CENTER GALGIANI HAD HER IN HER MICROPHONE OF FIRST YEAH [inaudible] CENTER GALGIANI -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR AUTHORING THE BILL AND I'VE CO SPONSORED IT WITH YOU AND ADMITTEDLY I KNEW VERY LITTLE LIVE. ACTUALLY CLOSE TO NOTHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND TELL YOU BROUGHT THE BILL FORWARD BUT AS SOMEONE FROM THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN WITH SCOLIOSIS A CURVE IN MY SPINE -- I KNOW I'M I'M JUST I'M SENSITIVE TO THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT BIRTH AND I WAS GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION ORIGINALLY BUT I THINK YOU SORT OF ANSWERED IT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. MOST OF US KNOW THAT AS YOUNG CHILDREN WE HAVE OUR TONSILS TAKEN OUT. BECAUSE IT REDUCES INFECTIONS WHEN WE'RE OLDER BUT THAT'S NOT DONE IT BIRTH IT'S DONE. WHEN? CHILDREN ARE OLDER FIVE SIX SEVEN I SUPPOSE -- MAYBE YOU CAN ONCE AGAIN SPEAK TO WHY WHY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SO COMMONLY DONE AND IT'S OKAY THAT THAT GUY AND LATER. IN LIFE BUT THURMOND AND SO DID HAVE IT'S SO DIFFERENT. WITH THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES RESPECTFULLY ON TO TRY TO SAY MY LAN I'MNOT NEAR NOSE AND THROAT SURGEON -- BUT BUT I AM SOMEONE WHO ALMOST HAD A TONSILLECTOMY AS A YOUNG CHILD -- THAT'S USUALLY DONE FOR INFECTION -- FOR SNORING -- FOR SLEEP APNEA -- SUE THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S IT TAT'S A DIFFERENT THAT'S A DIFFERENT BALL GAME AND IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE DECISIONAL THEM THE MOST RECENT DECISION ALL REGRET PAPER. ACTUALLY TALK TO PAY TO PARENTS ABOUT DECISIONAL REGRET AFTER TONSILLECTOMY. AND IT WAS 412409% OF PARENTS HAD DECISIONAL REGRET AFTER TONSILLECTOMY WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAPERS FOR THE C. H. -- REGRET YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE FROM THAN PARENTS REGRETTING TONSILLECTOMY SO -- THERE'S THAT AT BUT I THINK THAT. THE THE QUESTION MEDICAL NECESSITY AGAIN IT'S VERY STICKY. AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DEFINE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT. IT'S POSSIBLE. AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO DEFINE THAT IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T HARM SOME CHILDREN. AND THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE DEFINITIONS OF MEDICAL NECESSITY THIS ISN'T SOME SORT OF VAGUE AMBIGUOUS THING. AND YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT A PERSON STRUGGLES TO URINATE WERE. HAVING PHYSICAL PAIN OR HAVING YOUR AND THAT'S THAT'S ODD PULLING IN TRAPPED IN YOUR ****. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE DODD -- I THINK UNDER ANY REASONABLE DEFINITION WOULD BE MEDICAL NECESSITY AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING. IF IF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT OPPOSING THE STOCK PRICE AND SAY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE OPPOSE THE BILL. HAVE A CONCERN THEY ONCE YOU'RE CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY THE WAY THAT TYPICALLY WORKS IN THE LEGISLATURE IS A COME FORWARD AND SAY WE DON'T LIKE YOUR DEFINITION. HERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF SOMEONE IS IN PAIN IF SOMEONE HAS -- URINE PULLING IN EVERY CHINA AND CAN'T URINATE OR MIGHT URINATE WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO URINATE. IF SOMEONE -- IT IS REALLY HAVING THOSE MEDICAL PROBLEMS DOT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- HERE -- AND I THINK SIGNIFICANT -- IN MY BOOK BRING YOUR REVERSIBLE SURGERY -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF I HEARD IN CORRECTLY ABOUT QUOTE CHIU INTERSECTS PATIENTS BEING -- THREE TO FIVE PER YEAR DOT DOTS ODD THAT'S NOT ACCURATE IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE DR. I HAVE A QUESTION. ABOUT JOHNNY IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE DISPUTE IS AROUND WHAT THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY IS AND PERHAPS. YOU WILL CONSIDER IN ADDITION TO THE BILL NOT INSTEAD OF BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING AN ADVISORY TASK FORCE. OF SOME SORT THAT WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE MEDICAL POURED FOR WHAT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND IN THESE INSTANCES WE WILL BE OPEN TO THAT CAUGHT OUR CONVERSATION. ABSOLUTELY. THE DOCTOR LONG HAS BEEN A I'M GONNA WAIT SO IT IN LET'S SAY THAT NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO SENDER GALGIANI I WANT TO KEEP MOVING TO THE PANEL SO. WITH HER STATEMENT ABOUT TONSILLECTOMY -- AND SPECIFICALLY THE DATA USE YOU SUGGESTED AND DECISIONAL REGRET AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE DATA. SUPPOSEDLY ON THE THAT THEY ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE DONE ON THIS JUST LOOK WRITTEN PEOPLE CH WAS THAT WAS ACTUALLY SUPPOTED BY THE CARES FOUNDATION NUMBER ONE WHICH LEAVE THE TO IMPLICIT BIAS IN NUMBER. TWO THAT THE STUDY THAT SHE'S REFERRING TO FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF INDIANA I DOCTOR CON RESTOS MANSKE WAS ACTUALLY A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF PATIENTS WITH CH FROM THEIR CLINIC WHO RESPONDED TO AN ONLINE SURVEY. THIS IS COMPARED -- TO TONSILLECTOMY DATA THAT WAS DONE IN A PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL WE'RE PATIENTS WERE GIVEN THE OPTION TO HAVE SURGERY AND OR NOT IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE COMPARED DIRECTLY. AND I WANTED TO BRING THIS UP BECAUSE IT'S AN EXAMPLE I THINK OF WHAT IS ONE OF THE MOST RAMPANT. MOST DISAPPOINTING THINGS TO ME AS BEING A UROLOGIST AS A SCIENTIST AND A MOTHER -- BEING INVOLVED IN THIS FIELD IS IS THAT REPORT RELATIVE INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE WAY THAT THEY PRESENT DATA. AND INTERPRET DATA. OKAY CENTER GOALS ANYTHING ELSE. ALL RIGHT AT CENTER HILL AND CENTER LATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND AND THANK YOU --% SENATOR WIENER FOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AND I CERTAINLY RECALL THE ISSUE OF LAST YEAR AND AS YOU CAN FOR THE RESOLUTION AND CERTAINLY SUPPORTED IT. AND DOCTOR I I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU GET GO TO WORK EVERY MORNING YOU THERETO HELP THEIR PATIENTS IN THAT SUCH A WONDERFUL. THING AND I THINK JUST IN THIS ROOM AND AND SITTING UP HERE EVERYONE OF US. I THINK FEELS THE SAME WAY WHEN WE COME TO WORK -- IN SIT IN THIS ROOM AND IN THAT OTHER ROOM THAT'S BEHIND THIS -- IT'S IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THAT -- TO AND AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK WHICH MARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR VERY MEANINGFUL AND POWERFUL. OF IT IN IN I. N. ALSO IS A LOOK THROUGH THE ANALYSIS THAT THE THE VERY CAPABLE STAFF. PUT TOGETHER THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY ARE RAISED IN HERE IS SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT. A DEFINING THE YOU KNOW MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND HOW WE WOULD DO THAT AND HOW HOW YOU WOULD. THE TERMINOLOGY -- OF MEDICAL NECESSITY IT'S TOO LIMITING AND THE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HOW WE WOULD COME TO THAT AND WHICH WOULD PROBABLY MOST TROUBLING S THESE ARE DEFINITIONAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE AN CRAFT. AND THEN AS I LOOK AT THE LETTER FROM THE CALIFRNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS PROBABLY WHEN I HEAR THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING. OR ANYONE HAS BEEN WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE THEIR PERHAPS THE CLARIFICATION OR THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THERE'S ROOM HERE TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT AND WHICH TROUBLING TO IS A READ IT SAYS ON BEHALF OF THE THIS IS THE LETTER FROM THIS THE CMA. ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I THINK THEY'RE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND LICENSE PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY REPRESENT. SMALL PORTION OF THAT NUMBER IS THERE A GROUP SOMEWHERE. THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE -- AND IN THE COMMITTEE THAT CAN. OF CRAFT THOSE DEFINITIONS I THINK IF YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE TO WALK AWAY FROM THAT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT WITH THE RESOLUTION CALLED FOR LAST YEAR. AND THE SUPPORT THAT I THINK -- WE HAVE FOR SOME. SOME FUTURE OF SOME. SOME COMPROMISE IN THIS AND I THINK THE DEFINITIONS AS MISS MARCH WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MEAN THEIR SOMETHINGS THAT APPLIANCE SOMETHING'S IT SHOULDN'T APPLY. OF ED IN HIGH DIED -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES MOVE SO THAT WE CAN GET [inaudible] THOSE. QUESTIONS THOSE DEFINITIONS ANSWERED IN SOLVED IN SOME FORM BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND AND HOWEVER WAS FORWARD SO I APPRECIATE THIS THIS CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION -- BUT IT -- IT IS A IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE CAN'T SIT DOWN WITH THE PROFESSION -- THAT IS -- RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THESE DECISIONS AND AND GET TO THAT. THAT PLACE. ANSWER HAVE I MAY DISCOVER ONE BANK THIS MARKS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN WILLING TO TALK TO SOME OF OUR FOLKS AND SO I WANNA SAID NO ONE ON BUT IN TERMS OF THE MEDICAL SO THAT IT IS NOT A LUXURY NINE ARE SMART AND MARK THEM VERY GRACIOUSLY. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I MY CONCERN WAS THAT -- THAT THAT THOSE WHO WE LOOK TOWARDS TO TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND IF THEY HAVE NOT THAT'S THAT'S TROUBLING [inaudible] WEBSITE [inaudible] WE HAVE. THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL AS WELL WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF. WE HAD TWO MONTHS OF TRYING TO GET CA H. EXEMPTED FROM A SIMPLE RESOLUTION LAST YEAR THAT THAT THAT THE AUTHOR WOULDN'T TAKE IN THAT RESOLUTION SO WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD CONVERSATIONS. IT HAS COME UP IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE FUNDAMENTALLY THOUGH WE DO HAVE DIFFERENCES. OF THEY WANT TO LEGISLATE THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND CONSIDER THINGS LIKE HYPOSPADIAS AND C. H. AS INTERSEX. THE REALITY IS WE FUNDAMENTALLY DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. THEY WANT TO ALLOW THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANNA HAVE PARENTS INVOLVED IN THE DECISION WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT. THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL NECESSITY WE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH THOSE TO CENTER HELD YOU KNOW I I THINK A LOT ABOUT YOU AND WE'VE WORKED A LOT TOGETHER -- THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE OKAY AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES OKAY -- I'M GONNA GO TO IS CENTER LEYVA BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT TO LEAST RESPOND TO WITH A THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR HILL. I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. AND I THINK IT'S A POINT OF FRUSTRATION FOR ME. AND I THINK FOR OUR THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHERS IS THAT. THERE SEEMS TO BE ROOM TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND HERE AND ALL THE PARTNERS HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO PUT THAT. THINGS ON THE TABLE AND TRY TO CARVE OUT. DEFINITIONS MORE CONCISELY IT'S PART OF WHY I THINK THIS. BILL IS IS NOT READY AT THE MOMENT -- BUT I I AM I HAVE CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM THAT IF WE CAN KEEP WORKING ON IT THAT WE CAN TRY TO FIND THAT THAT SPACE. BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THAT THE COMMON GOALS WE ALL HAVE FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR KIDS SO IT IS A POINT OF FRUSTRATION -- EVEN THOUGH I HAVE I HAVE SOME AS YOU KNOW RELUCTANCE ABOUT -- MOVING THE BILL HAD TODAY. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO BOTH SIDES FOR BEING HERE THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE -- THIS IS A HARD SUBJECT THIS IS THIS IS DIFFICULT I READ THIS BOOK. IN PREPARATION FOR TODAY AND I READ ALL OF THE OPPOSITION LETTERS AND I READ. OF FROM THE THREE SURGEON GENERAL'S ALSO THAT I COULD TRY AND HELP MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. I TO LOVE MY JOB AND I TO EVERY DAY GO TO WORK HOPING I CAN CHANGE LIVES BETTER FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OF FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS BOOK AROUND ONE IN TWO THOUSAND BABIES IS DIFFERENT ENOUGH THE DOCTORS MAY RECOMMEND SURGICAL INTERVENTION INTERVENTION SO ONE IN. TWO THOUSAND THAT'S THAT'S NOT THAT THAT'S A LOT OF BABIES -- I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT SUBJECT. BUT SENATOR WIENER. ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF IT'S MEDICALLY AN NECESSARY. BATS WITH THE SURGERY SHOULDN'T HAPPEN ON A CHILD'S AT WHICH A BILL SAYING. ON A BABY CON A BABY HAS ACTUALLY. BUT SO AND THEN MY QUESTION FOR THE MEDICAL -- GROUP WOULD BE IF IT'S NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY AT THE TIME THE CHILD IS BORN WHY IS WAITING A PROBLEM. AND JUST TO REFER TO MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS -- I THINK THE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN OR COMPLICATIONS -- AND THEN THERE NEED FOR SURGERY THE SECOND SURGERY INCREASES -- AS THEY GET OLDER IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND IN. IN. A LOT OF OUR LITERATURE LE HENSLEY PAPER I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT WHEN DOCTOR WONG -- AND EVEN IN MY MOST RECENT RECENT EXPERIENCE AND GONNA WE OPERATED ON KIDS THAT WERE THE SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS OF AGE OPERATE YOUNG KIDS UP -- TO TWENTY AND THE KIDS WHO WERE TEENAGERS OLDER EVEN THE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS HAD A HIGHER RATE OF COMPLICATION -- AND ALTHOUGH ANECDOTAL -- I THINK THAT IT THE HENCE THE PAPER SHOWED THAT DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS ANOTHER PAPER I THINK FROM CANADA THE DEMONSTRATED THAT -- AND SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S HARDER FOR THE CHILDREN TO DELAY SURGERY. IN RESPONSE TO HURT HER REMARK TO ME I AM AWARE THAT PAPER AND THAT THE PAPER FROM TWO THOUSAND AND ONE USING -- TECHNIQUES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT OUTDATED. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT I THINK THEIR TOTAL THIRTY FIVE PATIENTS IN THAT COUNTRY IN THAT STUDY IN OVERALL THERE WAS A HIGHER RATE EVERY OPERATION EXCEPT IF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SUBGROUP ANALYSIS. ONLY EIGHT OF THOSE PATIENTS WERE ACTUALLY DINOVO HYPOSPADIAS IN OTHER WORDS ONLY EIGHT HAD NEVER HAD PREVIOUS SURGERY SO EIGHT THOSE OF THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE THERE WAS A 100% SUCCESS RATE AFTER TWO SURGERIES WHERE'S THE REMAINING PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD PREVIOUS. INFANT SURGERIES YES THEY HAD HIGHER COMPLICATION RATES WE JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT AGAIN THAT -- INTERPRETATION F MEDICAL DATA CAN BE VERY BIASED BASED ON PEOPLE'S PEOPLE'S OWN OPINIONS THANK YOU AND I DID WANT TO SAY ALSO THAT WE WE HEARD I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT BUT SOMEONE WAS TALKING ABOUT REFERRING TO STUDIES THIRTY YEARS AGO FORTY YEARS AGO. EVERYTHING IN HERE HAPPENED WITHIN THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS AND WHEN THEY YOU KNOW ONE MOTHER TALKED ABOUT I I THINK THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATION. I I'M NOT A DOCTOR BUT I HAVE CHILDREN I NEVER THOUGHT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN OUR TWINS WERE BORN THAT WE COULD HAVE AN INTEREST TAX CHILD I WISH SOMEONE HAD SAID THAT WE DIDN'T. BUT WHAT WHAT IF WE DID AND WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO FOR THIS CHILD. SO I THINK EDUCATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND TALKING TO PARENTS WHEN THERE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD THAT YOUR CHILD TO BE BORN EXIST OR WHEN YOUR CHILD IS BORN LIKE THIS THE FIRST THING YOU SAY IS CONGRATULATIONS. YOU HAVE A HEALTHY CHILD WHO LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN SOME OTHER CHILDREN DO BUT WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. MY WORRY IS THAT. IT WE'RE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER AS A SOCIETY AND WHEN I READ SOME OF THE STORIES ABOUT. ABOUT CHILDREN WHAT WE PUT IN THEM PUT THEM THROUGH AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY I THINK CA AT AGE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- I'D LIKE TO SEE US I THINK WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING FOR OPEN TO WORKING ON THINGS. I WORRY THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT SURGERY -- EARLIER THAN WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU CAN'T GO TO KINDERGARTEN TO BE WAITING YOUR PANTS ALL YOUR PEERS WITH THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT -- SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT ASPECT BUT YOU KNOW. I NGUYEN IN READING THE STUDY OF ONE MOTHER SAID TO SHARE SIX TOWN SHE JUST SAID SOMEONE ELSE WHY HER SON LOOK DIFFERENT. THAT'S JUST THE WAY HE WAS BORN AND HE LOOKS DIFFERENT DOWN THERE. AND WHY DO WE SO AS A SOCIETY WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE CONFORMS. WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU'RE BORN THE WAY YOU ARE? SO I I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF RAMBLING BUT I ALSO JUST THINK AS AS A SOCIETY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT CONVERSION THERAPY I'M SO GLAD THAT I WAS HERE TO GET TO BE A PART OF BANNING THAT. AS A MOTHER OF A GATE CHILD IF MY DAUGHTER BEEN BORN TWENTY YEARS AGO SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER -- WHICH OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HER SHE'S GETTING MARRIED IN THE FALL TO A WOMAN SHE'S JUST HPPY SHE CAN BE SHE SIX SUCCESSFUL WOMAN. BUT I WORRY THAT WE ARE DOING THE SURGERIES UNNECESSARILY ON THESE CHILDREN AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS SAID. SO ALL OF THAT TO SAY I WANT TO SEE THE I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY I WANT TO SEE IT MOVE OUT I HOPE THERE'S SOME WORK WE CAN DO I HOPE THAT -- THAT CMA AND AM A WILL COME TO THE TABLE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THERE SOMETIMES BUT FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS -- BUT THIS AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE'S LIVES SOME THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE FILLINGS HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. GRAY ANY OTHER -- COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER WINNER BEFORE I HAVE YOU CLOSE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A FIVE MINUTE RECESS SO WE'LL BE BACK IN FIVE MINUTES OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT RECESS -- BEFORE I AGREE I BRING IT BACK TO SENATOR WINNER TO CLOSE I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DAY AS CENTER GALGIANI. YOU KNOW I I BROUGHT UP EARLIER ABOUT WHETHER THE AUTHOR MIGHT AN ADVISORY BOARD TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ON AND WITH THE PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN THIS SPACE HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM THE DEFINITION OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY IN STATUTE OR WHATEVER THAT IS. I THINK THIS CHALLENGE THAT -- MY COLLEAGUES ARE HAVING IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. WHAT IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY WHAT'S NOT CERTAINLY SENATOR PAN HAS MUCH BROADER KNOWLEDGE THAN MOST OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE HERE BUT? I FEEL THAT WERE VERY CLOSE TO SENATOR HILL SAID AND YOU WERE WILLING -- TO CONSIDER PUTTING TOGETHER AN ADVISORY BOARD IN THIS CAPACITY TO ADVISE ON THIS -- SO I'M HOPING AND WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IF YOU WOULD. TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL TO CREATE THIS ADVISORY BOARD SAID THAT. WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS. COMING UP WITH THOSE DECISIONS. I'M THERE THE ANSWER IS YES CENTER  APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ALSO OF COURSE STAND READY TO WORK WITH THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS. ON ANY SUGGESTIONS THEY HAVE ABOUT THE FINING MEDICAL NECESSITY IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXISTING DEFINITION -- BUT THE ANSWER IS YES THANK YOU. SO -- I GUESS MY MY RESPONSE TO THAT SENATOR THAT CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS CENTER CALLED JOHNNY IS C. THANK YOU. THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO FIND THE SPACE IS COMMON GROUND SPACE. AND I THINK IF IT MEANS THAT WE TAKE IN ANOTHER WEEK AND WORK THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS -- WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. WE CAN SEE WHETHER WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE IN THE RIGHT FORM FOR US TO TO CONSIDER -- NEXT WEEK ON THIS ISSUE. AT THAT IS THAT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOU'RE HEADING. I THINK IT'S ONE THAT I CAN SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WITHOUT THAT FURTHER DO THAT LET'S FINAL COMMENT CENTER PAN. SO I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT -- BASICALLY IN THE BILL SAYS DOING THIS IS UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHICH MEANS YOU'RE THREATENING LICENSE OF A PHYSICIAN AND EVEN. AND IT BUT FIRST THE TREATMENT SO IT'S FAIRLY BROAD SO IT. ALSO MEANS THAT -- I MEAN IT'S NOT CLEAR I MEAN SOME OF THESE CAN SAY MEDICAL NECESSITY BUT SOME OF IT ALSO -- I THINK RACISM CHALLENGES FOR PHYSICIANS TO KNOW YELP BUT WHAT POINTER LICENSE MIGHTBE THREATENED -- WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO REMOVE THE SECTION ON A PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. I'M WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS IS -- AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE LAW SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT GENERAL CONVERSATION. TO SEE IF WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION ON IT -- AND WHAT THAT AUTUMN A RESOLUTION WOULD BE -- I'D I CAN SAY BUT AS A SAY IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO. AND WE AGAIN IN BY -- THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS -- TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH US ON THESE ISSUES SUCH AS A CLEAR FOR YOU WOULD BE OPEN TO REMOVING SECTION I PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT I AM I AM OPEN TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE FOR VIOLATING. THE LAW I CANSAY HERE TODAY THE DOT WILL BE REMOVING THIS -- BUT WE'RE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION NOT RULING ANYTHING OUT. WE WELCOME THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS A CONCERN I HEAR THAT -- HER I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE AND I HEAR IT AGAIN TODAY AND I HEAR WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SENATOR -- BUT WE'RE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION I CAN SEE WHAT THE FINAL RESULT WILL BEBECAUSE THAT WILL BE. AS A RESULT OF DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION WORK COLLABORATIVELY WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED TODAY ON THIS LEGISLATION MR BACK WAS RIGHT LAST YEAR ON THE RESOLUTION -- CMA DID WORK WITH US AND WE APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH AND AGAIN. ANYONE HAS A RIGHT TO CATEGORICALLY OPPOSED ANYTHING THEY WANT THIS ISN'T A CRITICISM OR SAYING THAT IT'S SOMEHOW ON PROFESSIONAL TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S THE APPROACH OF THE TAKEN AND IT HAS HINDERED. OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. THE ADDRESS THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. SENATOR WIENER AYE MINUTE AT TAKE THE DISCRETION OF THE CHAIR TO SAY THANK YOU TO UP MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU TO YOUR WITNESSES. BOTH IN FAVOR AND AGAINST THE DOCTORS HAVE TRAVELED HERE FROM FAR. AND WIDE -- THOSE WHO HAD THESE EXPERIENCES TO SHARE WITH US. THEIR STORIES I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IN DEPTH AND THOUGHTFUL HEARING ON A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT IN WHICH I THINK ALL OF US SHARE THE SAME GOAL. WHICH IS PATIENT CARE AND DOING THE RIGHT THING -- FOR FOLKS -- IN WHATEVER CONDITION LIFE THAT WITH THAT THEY ARE HERE -- AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- WE'RE GONNA AT THE FOR THIS -- ISSUE. THESE FOR OTHER WEEK WILL GO AND WORK TOGETHER -- AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND A A PATHWAY THAT TO INCORPORATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND IDEAS THAT SENATOR GALGIANI AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED. AS FOR CLARIFICATIONS OF THE COURT IS SAYING WE'RE NOT THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT BE VOTING TODAY. THAT WOULD NOT BE THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE HEADING RIGHT NOW YES OKAY SO IT'S BEING TAKEN OFF WE'RE GOING TO DEFER THIS AND THAT AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET THE ISSUE IN SHAPE. FOR ANOTHER ANOTHER HEARING AND CONSIDERATION NEXT WEEK OKAY SO THE IT WOULD DEPEND THE AGENDA IS FOR NEXT WEEK NEXT MONDAY YES SIR. OKAY AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE LAST. UPDATE TO THIS COMMITTEE COULD HERE BECAUSE IT IS DOUBLE REFERRED. UNDER A CAR WITHOUT WILL WAIVERS I THINK THE YOU ARE CORRECT OKAY -- I BOUGHT WHILE I AM NOT AGREED WITH THAT DECISION I RESPECTED TERRACE PRAGUE TO DO THAT AND WE WILL WORK IN EARNEST AND IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE CHAIR AND WITH ANY STAKEHOLDER THE ONCE PARTICIPATED. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK AYE CENTERS WE ARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUESTION SO THAT MEAN WHEN WE RECONVENE ON MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE'LL JUST BE HERE FOR A VOTE ONLY. WELL I'M GONNA SEE WHETHER THERE'S AN AMENDMENT THAT CAN BE CRAFTED THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE THE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN HERE TODAY. AND DEPENDING ON THAT CONDITION OF THAT POTENTIAL AMENDMENT IT WOULD BE SET FOR A HEARING. WITH THE BILL AS AMENDED OR AS AS A VOTE ONLY ON THAT MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE US I JUST WORRY ABOUT ALL THE WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES THAT TRAVEL TO BE HERE TODAY AND WOULD HAVE TO TRY AND BE BACK NEXT MONDAY. THAT'S HOW I ENCOURAGE THEM TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST. TO KEEP THEM INFORMED ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING. THANK YOU VERY GOOD OKAY.

THE NEXT NINE MEMBER COMMITTEE MEMBER WHO IS HERE. SENATOR MITCHELL WELCOME SB SIX THIRTY NINE JUST GOT IN JUST IN TIME. WE WELCOME YOU HERE. I APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. TODAY ON PRESENTING BILL SIX THREE NINE A MEASURE THAT WILL INCREASE IN STRENGTH IN CONSUMER PROTECTION SURROUNDED MEDICAL CREDIT CARD THAT ARE OFFERED TO PATIENTS. BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. QUICK BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND ASSEMBLY BILL ARE REQUIRED DID JUST TO GIVE NOTICES PRIOR DECIDED TO PATIENT FOR CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. I CARRY BILL AND FOURTEEN WHICH EXPANDED THESE RULES TO IN THE LIFE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. WHILE THE LAW DOES PROVIDE FOR BASIC PATIENT NOTIFICATION CONSUMERS -- ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE CONCEPT AROUND DEFERRED INTEREST IN THAT THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM. PATIENTS ARE SHOCKED AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THE HIGH INTEREST RATES OF THEIR REQUIRED TO PAY. AFTER ACCEPTED THEIR RECEIVING SERVICES MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE MARKET WITH AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD OF ZERO INTEREST. FULL BUT THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE WAY IN WHICH THE INTEREST IS APPLIED SO FOR EXAMPLE A CONSUMER CAN GET CAUGHT OFF GUARD WITH THEIR FINANCED A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PAY OFF NINE HUNDRED WITH AN INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. BUT IT DIDN'T HIT WITH THE 27% INTEREST RATE CHARGE NOT ON THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS BUT ON THE ORIGINAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR -- EXPENSE WHILE MOST CONSUMERS EXPECT THAT INTEREST TO RISE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTRODUCTORY PERIOD. HE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THESE PRODUCTS CONTAIN THIS DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISION. SO WE'RE HOPING TO PROPOSE A SOLUTION BEFORE YOU TODAY SB THREE SIX THREE NINE ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY DOING THE FOLLOWING FIRST PROHIBITS MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH DEFERRED INTEREST PROVISIONS. SECONDLY IT PROHIBITS MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM CHARGING TO MEDICAL CREDIT CARD SERVICES NOT YET RENDERED. THIRD IT REQUIRES PROVIDERS THAT ACCEPT MEDICARE OUT TO EXPLAIN TO MEDI CAL PATIENTS ONLY WHAT MEDI CAL DOES AND DOES NOT COVER. AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT ALL THEIR PATIENTS GET THAT SAME EPLANATION AND FINALLY IT REARWARDS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE SERVICES TO A LEVEL THAT IS MORE. UNDERSTANDABLE AND APPROPRIATE. WE UNDERSTAND WE WERE APPROACHED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE FLAG TO TACKLE A TECHNICAL MEMBER TO CLARIFY THE AGAIN THE LANGUAGE WITH ONLY -- BE MADE AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL PROVIDERS WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT LANGUAGE THE BILL AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR IT'S BEEN DOUBLE REFER TO CITY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SO WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO MAKE THE CHANGES BEFORE IT GETS TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE. ALL THIRD PARTY FINANCING IS INDEED BENEFICIAL WHEN PATIENTS NEED SERVICES THAT THEY CAN'T IMMEDIATELY AFFORD MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHICH WAS BEAUTIFULLY LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY WE'VE GOT CHEN FLORI WHO REPRESENTS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL THE WEST IS THERE A LONG POVERTY -- POVERTY AND ALLEN BOY THIS YOU SEE HERE YEAH OKAY. WHO'S A MEDICAL CREDIT CARD CONSUMER I ASK FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR -- CHEN WE LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONIAL NOTE THAT -- THIS BILL DOES ENJOY BROAD BASED SUPPORT NO OPPOSITION AT THE MOMENT THAT WE WELCOME YOU OKAY THOUGHTS ARE WITNESS ALSO BE ALLEN TO BE HERE IN A SECOND TO SHARE HIS STORY BUT FIRST -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M CHEN FLORA THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WESTERN CENTER WAS A SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION AB ONE SEVENTY ONE AND TWO THOUSAND NINE AFTER HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCE PARTNERS. WHO OFFER FREE CONSUMER ASSISTANCE TO THE STATE REPORTED A NUMBER OF CASES CONSUMERS WHO HAD SIGNED UP FOR MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS THINKING THEY'D ENTERED INTO A PAYMENT PLAN WITH OUR DENTISTS? DESPITE THAT LAW AND SENATOR MITCHELL'S EXPANSION OF IT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROBLEMS WITH HOW MEDICAL CREDIT CARDS ARE PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME CONSUMERS -- IN ONE MOMENT MR BORN THIS YEAR'S GOING TO TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT HE HAD WITH DEFERRED INTEREST BUT I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE SEEN -- OKAY KEEP IN MIND THAT I THINK THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT ON THE COMMITTEE HAS OUT AND YOU'RE WELCOME DISABILITY TO TESTIMONY IN WRITING THAT EVERY WILL SHARE WITH EVERYONE. YES LET HIM [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND SENATORS OF PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M ALLEN POINT AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN FROM LAGUNA BEACH. FOUR YEARS AGO I NEEDED A NUMBER OF DENTAL PROCEDURES. AND CONSIDERING THE EXPENSE AND AMOUNT OF WORK MY DENTIST RECOMMENDED FINANCING WITH THE CARECREDIT PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGH SYNCHRONY BANK. I CARE CREDIT LOOKED ATTRACTIVE AS EXPLAINED IF I MADE ALL MY PAYMENTS ON TIME AND THE BALANCE IS PAID OFF. BY THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD ALL INTEREST WOULD BE WAIVED. SO SYNCHRONY BANK CLOSES DEFERRED INTEREST. BUT THE FOR DISPATCHES MEAN CHARGING INTEREST ON THE BALANCE OF THE LOAN NOT PAID OFF DURING THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. RATHER THEY BACK CHARGE INTEREST ON THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL IM MAPPED. WITH COMPOUNDED INTEREST ON THE INTEREST AND THAT IS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE BALANCE IS PAID DOWN OR NOT DURING THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. ON MY FIRST CARE CREDIT BILL WAS FOR THIRTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS. I PAID Vì AT LEAST THE MINIMUM EVERY MONTH WHICH LEFT ME WITH A BALANCE OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AT THE END OF THE TWELVE MONTH PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. AFTER PROMOTIONAL PERIOD MY BILL WAS A STICKER SHOCK IT WAS UP NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE DOLLARS ON A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. SO I TRY TO DO THE MATH. FIGURE OUT HOW SYNCHRONY JUSTIFIED THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS IN INTEREST. ON A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BALANCE. AND AFTER TWELVE MONTHS EVEN AT TWENTY SIX POINT 99% INTEREST. WELL TURNS OUT THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS ON THE SIX ON YOUR BALANCE WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE INTEREST OF A WHOPPING FIFTY ONE POINT 7%. AND I I CALLED SYNCHRONY TO EXPLAIN AND JUSTIFY. WHAT ARE WHAT THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE OF WHAT'S WHAT I DID THE MATH? THEY TOLD ME THEY DO MATH DIFFERENTLY IT'S YEAH NEWMAN HE SAID THE THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS WAS CORRECT BASED ON THE ORIGINAL BALANCE OF THIRTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO I WAS TOLD TO REVIEW THE THREE PAGE CONTRACT THAT WAS GIVEN MOMENTS BEFORE NOVA KAINE -- WITH DENTAL PAIN. BY THE WAY SOMEWHERE BURIED ON PAGE TWO IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE SIX POINT UNREADABLE FONTS WITH THE EXPLANATION JUSTIFYING THE CHARGES SO I ASKED THEM TO GIVE ME A HYPOTHETICAL HI I GAVE THEM. A HYPOTHETICALLY SAID SYNCHRONY. IF I WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL ON A HEART ATTACK. AND I HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BILLS. AND PAY DOWN NINETY NINE THOUSAND NINE NINETY NINE BEFORE THE IN THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD LEAVING ONE DOLLAR LEFT AFTERWARDS WITH THE TWENTY SIX POINT 99% INTEREST BE. THE ONE DOLLAR BALANCE OR ON THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THE ANSWER WAS ON A HUNDRED THOUSAND I SAID OKAY. SO. I'M NOT A LAWYER. BUT I THINK I KNOW WITHIN CITY IS PREDATORY PRACTICES ARE ON CARE CARE CREDIT PROGRAM REALLY PRAISE ON THE VULNERABLE AT A TIME OF MEDICAL NEED. ON AND DENTAL CARE SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE CALL A GREEDY OR USURY OR JUST PLAIN RIP OFF BUT I I CALLED ON AMERICANS TO CHARGE ON INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAID DOWN. AND I WOULD APPRECIATE AND RESPECT A YES VOTE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I IS THE NEWEST HERO HAD ROOT CANAL ON FRIDAY AND AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BILLS IT WAS REALLY IT. TOO BUT I'M I HOPEFULLY YOU'RE DOING WELL ON THAT THE DENTAL SIDE CHEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN FAVOR. PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIKE IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY YOURSELF. GOOD AFTERNOON JACK RECORDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH US VERY VERY RECENTLY WHICH WE ARE.

WELCOME TO THE BILL CENTER PAN IS MOVE THE BILL SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL THAT CENTER MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. ACTUALLY I VOTE OKAY VERY GOOD. MISSION IS TO PASS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GLAZER BY LASER EYE CHIANG. CHING AYE ARCHULETA. LET AYE DODD. THOUGHT I GALGIANI JUDGE ANY AYE HILL. FILL AYE LEYVA [inaudible] PAN. RIGHT PAN AYE WILK HI GUYS. THE BILL HAS A VOTE CELL WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SAID INITIAL. RIGHT SENATOR SKINNER I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT KEEP IN MIND IF YOU WANT TO DEFER TO AFTER FLOOR SESSION YOU CAN -- BUT WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER. OKAY VERY GOOD SO LET'S -- LET'S CALL CENTERS GOODNESS GUNNERS BILL. AS BEFORE -- SEVENTY FIVE AS FAR AS I NOTICE AND ENJOY ANY OPPOSITION SO. CENTER SKINNER YOU CAN BEGIN AND THERE ARE SOME -- TO A MAN YES AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL READ -- RESPONSE RETAIN REFINE MY CONFINE MY REMARKS TO IS THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THEY WERE -- WELL CONSTRUCTED. AND I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES AND SPORT IN OTHERWISE I ASK YOUR AYE BOTH VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTERS SKINNER. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE GLAZER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MICHAEL WHEELER I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF POLICY FOR FLOW KANA. A CALIFORNIA BASED CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN COMPANY WITH A FOCUS ON SMALL FARM SON GROUND REGENERATIVE WE CULTIVATED CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FOR SB. FOUR SEVEN FIVE SB FOUR SEVEN FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZE LICENSE TO CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO CREATE AND PROVIDE TRADE SAMPLES. OF CANNABIS GOODS INTERNALLY INTO OTHER LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES. AS BEFORE SEVEN FIVE WOULD NOT AMEND THE RETAIL TO CONSUMER PROHIBITION ON FREE SAMPLES TO CUSTOMERS. IN MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES TRADE SAMPLES ARE ROUTINELY USED TO TEST QUALITY ENABLE PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE. IN INFORMAL TRANSACTION. FOR YOUR BENEFIT. THINK OF WINE FOR EXAMPLE WHERE IN THE WINE MAKER REMOVES A PORTION OF WINE AGING IN A BARREL TO ASSESS QUALITY. IF SHE WERE IN THE CAMPUS INDUSTRY THAT ACTION WILL NOT CURRENTLY BE ALLOWABLE. OR CONSIDER THE COFFEE INDUSTRY WHERE THE SMALL GROWER SENDS A SMALL PORTION OF FRESHLY HARVESTED BEANS TO A ROASTER FOR COMPARISON. WITH OTHER SMALL BATCH HARVESTS. IF THAT COFFEE ROASTER WERE IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. HE DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS TO ENABLE COMPARISON CROSS HARVEST LOTS. TO DECIDE WHICH TO PURCHASE. AND LASTLY IN THE HEAVILY REGULATED SECTOR OF ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTION. A DISTRIBUTOR IS ABLE TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS SAMPLES TO RETAILER WITH THE HOPE THAT AFTER ASSESSING THE PRODUCT THEY WILL PLACE AN ORDER IN STOCK THEIR SHELVES. IF THAT ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTOR WERE IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THEY WOULD NEED TO FIRST ASK THE RETAILER TO PLACE AN ORDER. FOR THE SAMPLE BEFORE TRANSPORTING THAT SAMPLE TO THE RETAIL STORE.
