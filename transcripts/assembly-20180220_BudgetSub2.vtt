00:33:25.504 --> 00:33:28.974 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:30.609 region:rollup2
THEIR FEEL LESS OF STUDYING AS

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:32.010 region:rollup2
WAS TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS AND

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:33.345 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.980 region:rollup2
SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:36.848 region:rollup2
PROPOSED INVESTMENTS REALLY

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.183 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON A BATH AND THEN THEME

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:40.552 region:rollup2
AT THE SYSTEMS NEW STRATEGIC

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:42.521 region:rollup2
PLAN AND BUILD UPON THE

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:44.155 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS INCIDENTS CASSETTES

00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:45.891 region:rollup2
OF THE PRIOR YEARS.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.558 region:rollup2
SO I WANNA START BY TALKING

00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:48.426 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:50.295 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:51.963 region:rollup2
FOR A NEW STUDENT CENTERED UP

00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:53.665 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA FOR GENERAL

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:55.367 region:rollup2
PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT.

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:56.735 region:rollup2
SO THE EXISTING FUNDING.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.403 region:rollup2
FOR GENERAL PURPOSE

00:33:56.735 --> 00:33:59.971 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT SET UP FOR THE

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:01.273 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HALL EDGES IS BASED ON

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:02.607 region:rollup2
A ROMANCE OF FULL TIME

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:04.042 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT STUDENTS.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:05.477 region:rollup2
THIS CAUSES DISTRICTS TO

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:07.579 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE AND ROAMING GROWTH

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:08.713 region:rollup2
AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIPS

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:10.315 region:rollup2
FOR DISTRICTS THAT ARE DECLINING

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:11.449 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENTS. FURTHER THAT'S A

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:12.918 region:rollup2
ROMAN BASED.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:15.420 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT FUNNY MODEL DOES

00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:16.922 region:rollup2
NOT A PROPERLY REFLECT THAT

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.957 region:rollup2
GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:20.659 region:rollup2
OR IN THE STATE'S PRIORITIES TO

00:34:18.957 --> 00:34:22.360 region:rollup2
BETTER SERVE STUDENTS TO

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:24.362 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE. AYE UNTIL THE MADE

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.931 region:rollup2
EQUITY GAPS GIVEN THAT IT'S ONLY

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:28.366 region:rollup2
REWARDS ENROLLMENT WITHOUT ANY

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:29.434 region:rollup2
OTHER CONSIDERATION FOR STUDENT

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.769 region:rollup2
SUCCESS METRICS.

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.971 region:rollup2
TO BETTER INCENTIVE AND REWARD

00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:34.372 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:35.607 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSES A NEW FUNDING

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:36.675 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND THERE ARE THREE

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:38.276 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS TO THAT FUNDING

00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:40.078 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:41.446 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:43.415 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:45.016 region:rollup2
TO DISTRICTS THROUGH A BASE CRAP

00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:47.285 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BASED ON A ROMANCE A

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:49.454 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING. I

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:51.656 region:rollup2
HAVE FUNDING FORMULA AS A WAY TO

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:53.258 region:rollup2
REALLY PROTECT AND ACCESS.

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.559 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:55.827 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO DO TO

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:57.195 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THROUGH A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:58.930 region:rollup2
GRANT THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THE

00:34:57.195 --> 00:35:00.498 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.800 region:rollup2
THAT THE DISTRICT A ROLES.

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.867 region:rollup2
AND THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.070 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:06.738 region:rollup2
THROUGH A STUDENT SUCCESS GRANT

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.807 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:10.108 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE

00:35:08.807 --> 00:35:11.276 region:rollup2
AND THE NUMBER STUDENTS WHO

00:35:10.108 --> 00:35:13.244 region:rollup2

CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER IN THREE

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.414 region:rollup2
YEARS OR LESS.

00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:17.882 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE STUDENT SUCCESS

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:19.684 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRAB WHAT INCLUDE

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:21.453 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EACH

ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER

00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:24.222 region:rollup2
GRANTED BY THE COLLEGE AS A WAY

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.991 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER AND SENT THAT

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:28.026 region:rollup2
SEAMLESS TRANSFER.

00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:29.294 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO BALANCE

00:35:28.026 --> 00:35:30.829 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO MAINTAIN ACCESS

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:32.263 region:rollup2
WHILE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:33.898 region:rollup2

IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS.

00:35:37.836 --> 00:35:40.538 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT PROPOSED

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:42.307 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA WOULD AT GREATER

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:44.342 region:rollup2
FISCAL STABILITY TO THE COLLEGES

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:45.143 region:rollup2

MOMENT. WE KNOW THAT WHEN

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:50.115 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD

00:35:48.413 --> 00:35:52.150 region:rollup2

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:17.622 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO GO DIRECTLY TO CSU

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:19.157 region:rollup2
MORE TO GO TO THE U. AT THE

00:44:17.622 --> 00:44:20.424 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND TRANSFER THERE

00:44:19.157 --> 00:44:21.959 region:rollup2
AFTER.

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:23.227 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT SOMETIMES A

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:26.063 region:rollup2
COUPLE TIMES DURING THE EIGHTIES

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:27.932 region:rollup2
YES USE PULL WAS TOO SMALL. AND

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:29.367 region:rollup2
IT WAS LOOSENING ADMISSION

00:44:27.932 --> 00:44:31.002 region:rollup2
CRITERIA AND RESPONSE

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:32.870 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU SEE IS TODAY UNDER THE

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:33.437 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT STUDY AS A FORTY ONE

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.972 region:rollup2
PERCENT SO ABOVE THE MASTER

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:36.474 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.175 region:rollup2
GOALS.

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:40.244 region:rollup2
UC WAS FOUND TO BE A FOURTEEN

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:41.579 region:rollup2
PERCENT SO SOMEONE ABOVE THAT

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:44.248 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT SIDE

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:46.751 region:rollup2
UNDER A MASTER PLAN.

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:47.785 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE AND THIS YEAR IS

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:49.854 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE STATE MAY

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:51.656 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES SHOULD ADJUST THEIR

00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:53.257 region:rollup2
ADMISSION CRITERIA TO GET BACK

00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:55.593 region:rollup2
TO THE MASTER PLAN ELIGIBILITY

00:44:53.257 --> 00:44:57.295 region:rollup2
POOLS OR CHANGE THE MASTER PLAN

00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:59.163 region:rollup2
ON STABILITY POOLS AND ALLOW

00:44:57.295 --> 00:45:00.431 region:rollup2
BOTH THE UNIVERSITY SEGMENT SO

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.667 region:rollup2
REMAIN ABOUT THAT.

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:05.069 region:rollup2
IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO.

00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:06.370 region:rollup2
THE MORE TRADITIONAL POOLS YOU

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:07.872 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.640 region:rollup2
OF LOWER STATE COSTS LOWER

00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:11.108 region:rollup2
STUDENT COSTS

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.543 region:rollup2
IF YOU EXPANDED THE POOL YOU

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:13.811 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:15.580 region:rollup2
OF ALLOWING MORE STUDENTS TO GO

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:17.782 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE STATEMENTS.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.916 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

00:45:17.782 --> 00:45:20.251 region:rollup2
AMONGST MANY THAT YOU MIGHT WANT

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:22.253 region:rollup2
TO CONSIDER.

00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:23.721 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT.

00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:26.324 region:rollup2
IS THINKING ABOUT TODAY IS

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:27.491 region:rollup2
GRADUATION EXPECTATIONS SO

00:45:26.324 --> 00:45:29.660 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS THE COMMON CORE

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.429 region:rollup2
STATE STANDARDS MOST STATES DO

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.863 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED IT IS USING

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.298 region:rollup2
THEM. UNDER THE COMMON CORE

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:36.334 region:rollup2
STATE STANDARDS EVERY HIGH

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:36.901 region:rollup2
SCHOOL GRADUATE IS EXPECTED TO

00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:38.603 region:rollup2
BE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:40.071 region:rollup2
CAREER. YOU'VE HEARD PROBABLY

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:42.206 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE STATE'S SCHOOL

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:44.041 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD WE USE IT TO EVALUATE

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:45.376 region:rollup2
DISTRICT PERFORMANCE AS PART OF

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.544 region:rollup2
THAT DASHBOARD WE HAVE THE

00:45:45.376 --> 00:45:49.013 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS

00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:50.648 region:rollup2
INDICATOR. IT MEASURES THE SHARE

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.916 region:rollup2
OF THAT A DISTRICT STUDENTS THAT

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:53.317 region:rollup2
ARE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:55.086 region:rollup2
CAREER APPROACHING PREPARED

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:56.487 region:rollup2
UNPREPARED.

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:57.355 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE QUESTION ITS LAST

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:59.457 region:rollup2
WHETHER STUDENTS SHOULD BE

00:45:57.355 --> 00:46:00.891 region:rollup2
PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER

00:45:59.457 --> 00:46:01.826 region:rollup2
AND MORE HOW DOES THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:03.327 region:rollup2
ONE A DESIGN THAT'S HIGHER

00:46:01.826 --> 00:46:04.629 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TO WHAT

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.730 region:rollup2
EXTENT DOES IT WANT TO ENCOURAGE

00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:06.797 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO DO THEIR LOWER

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.866 region:rollup2
DIVISION COURSEWORK AFTER

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:11.202 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OR ENCOURAGE

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:12.870 region:rollup2
THEM TO RURAL DIRECTLY AT YOU

00:46:11.202 --> 00:46:14.705 region:rollup2
SEE ARE CSU.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.307 region:rollup2
THE SECOND COMMENT SPAM FACTOR

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IN MIND I

00:46:16.307 --> 00:46:19.143 region:rollup2
KEEP IN MIND IS OVER THE LAST

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.478 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS THE STATE AND THE

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:22.079 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE MADE

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:23.981 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS IMPROVE THE

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:25.182 region:rollup2
TRANSFER PATHWAY. IF YOU LOOK

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:26.917 region:rollup2
COMPETE JUST FORTY FIVE AND

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:28.285 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR AND FORTY FIVE YOU

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.954 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED TO DO THAT NOW BUT WE

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:32.056 region:rollup2
GO AT LENGTH INTO THESE VARIOUS

00:46:29.954 --> 00:46:33.958 region:rollup2
EFFORTS THAT THE STATE COLLEGES.

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:35.226 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE.

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:36.794 region:rollup2
I'M OF THOSE EFFORTS AGAIN ARE

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:39.030 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.864 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO TRANSFER INCREASING

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.265 region:rollup2
THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:42.800 region:rollup2
ACCEPTED INCREASING THEIR

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:44.802 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING OUT OF CSU

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.403 region:rollup2
WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ADDITIONAL

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:47.138 region:rollup2
WORK IN GETTING A BACHELOR'S

00:46:45.403 --> 00:46:49.140 region:rollup2
DEGREE. SO CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS

00:46:47.138 --> 00:46:51.409 region:rollup2
IN THOSE AREAS.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.309 region:rollup2
SO TURNING TO ENROLLMENT.

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:54.512 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE FOR PITCH

00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:55.980 region:rollup2
AIDS.

00:46:54.512 --> 00:46:57.715 region:rollup2
AND IT JUST SHOWS A GROWTH IN

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.083 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES.

00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:00.685 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT GROWTH IS

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:02.520 region:rollup2
SLOW IN IF YOU WERE TO LOOK FROM

00:47:00.685 --> 00:47:04.822 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND AND

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.724 region:rollup2
EIGHT. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH

00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:07.825 region:rollup2
WAS TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT.

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:09.193 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.061 region:rollup2
NINE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AT

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:11.796 region:rollup2
SLOW IN ZERO POINT SIX.

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:13.364 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:14.665 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK OUT OVER THE COURSE

00:47:13.364 --> 00:47:16.133 region:rollup2
OF THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:18.803 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO SLOW EVEN FURTHER

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:20.371 region:rollup2
TWO ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT.

00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:22.173 region:rollup2
SO THIS I HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:23.874 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THE LIKELIHOOD

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:26.577 region:rollup2
YOU'D SEE REQUESTS FROM UC AND

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:27.778 region:rollup2
CSU ASKING FOR NEW SPACE.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:29.480 region:rollup2
YOU SEE ANSWER TO CLEARLY HAS

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:30.881 region:rollup2
AGING FACILITIES SO YOU'D EXPECT

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.183 region:rollup2
THE IT WAS CONTINUE TO SEE

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:33.751 region:rollup2
REQUESTS FOR RENEWAL AND

00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:35.086 region:rollup2
RENOVATIONS BUT IT WOULD BE LESS

00:47:33.751 --> 00:47:37.421 region:rollup2
LIKELY. THAT BASED UPON

00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:40.458 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH YOU'D BE SEEN

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:42.393 region:rollup2
I REQUEST FOR NEW CAPITAL.

00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:43.661 region:rollup2
TURNING TO AFFORDABILITY. IF YOU

00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:45.196 region:rollup2
LOOK AT FIGURE EIGHTS PAGE

00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:47.365 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

00:47:45.196 --> 00:47:49.333 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE COLLEGE'S

00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:50.434 region:rollup2
FEW LEVELS ARE RATHER RELATIVE

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.036 region:rollup2
TO SOMEWHERE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:53.170 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY.

00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:55.306 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE AT THE COMMUNITY

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.141 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND CSU RATES IN

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:57.708 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ARE STILL NOTABLY

00:47:57.141 --> 00:47:59.710 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE

00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:01.579 region:rollup2
COUNTRY. BUT COLLEGES THEIR

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
TUITION LEVELS LESS THAN HALF OF

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:04.749 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:07.151 region:rollup2
CSU IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.419 region:rollup2
AVERAGE BY SIXTEEN PERCENT THIS

00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:09.920 region:rollup2
THE GUINNESS FIGURE EIGHT ON

00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:11.989 region:rollup2
PAGE THIRTEEN.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.357 region:rollup2
YOU SEE IN CONTRAST WAS HIGHER

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.959 region:rollup2
THAN THEIR AVERAGE OF SIMILAR

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:18.662 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS TWENTY ONE PERCENT

00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:20.831 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:22.633 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE NINE. PAGE

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:24.535 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN JUST THE NEXT PAGE YOU

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:26.537 region:rollup2
CAN SEE JUST HOW VOLATILE FEE

00:48:24.535 --> 00:48:28.072 region:rollup2
LEVELS HAVE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:26.537 --> 00:48:30.107 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE YEARS OF STEEP

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:32.309 region:rollup2
INCREASE THOSE FOLLOWED BY FLAP

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:34.011 region:rollup2
PERIODS. THE STEEP INCREASES ARE

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:36.180 region:rollup2
DURING RECESSIONS ECONOMIC

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:38.182 region:rollup2
SLOWDOWNS TIMES WHEN FAMILIES

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.750 region:rollup2
ARE. LIKELY THEIR ECONOMIC

00:48:38.182 --> 00:48:41.585 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS ARE SOMEWHAT MORE

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.620 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT YOU CONCEIVE FLAT

00:48:41.585 --> 00:48:44.421 region:rollup2
PERIODS DURING THE ECONOMIC

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.490 region:rollup2
EXPANSIONS DURING PERIODS WHEN

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:48.793 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S ECONOMIC SITUATIONS

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.127 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE IMPROVING.

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:51.662 region:rollup2
WE'VE RECOMMENDED FOR YEARS THAT

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:53.464 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAVE A TUITION POLICY

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:55.032 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD WORK VERY DIFFERENTLY

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:56.734 region:rollup2
SO UNDER THE FEE POLICY THERE

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:58.436 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GRADUAL MODEST

00:48:56.734 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
INCREASES DURING GOOD TIMES WHEN

00:48:58.436 --> 00:49:01.972 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WAGES ARE LIKELY TO BE

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.307 region:rollup2
GOING UP SOMEWHAT.

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:04.875 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF THE STATE HOW TO

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:06.343 region:rollup2
RESERVE AND IF THERE WERE EVER A

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.678 region:rollup2
TIME WHERE RATES WOULD BE FLAT

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE DURING RECESSIONS

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:10.414 region:rollup2
WHEN FAMILIES WHICH IS LIKELY

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:12.183 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE INCREASED IN ARE

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:14.051 region:rollup2
INCREASING AS MUCH. THAT COULD

00:49:12.183 --> 00:49:16.520 region:rollup2
ONLY BE DONE AGAIN AT THE STATE

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:16.821 region:rollup2
WERE SITTING ON A HALF RESERVE.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.489 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE.

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:20.524 region:rollup2
.

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:22.626 region:rollup2
LOOK IT JUST FIGURE ELEVEN HERE

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:24.028 region:rollup2
ON THE FACING PAGE YOU CAN SEE

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:25.296 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE FINANCIAL AID

00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:27.498 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS FOR

00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:31.302 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:33.437 region:rollup2
.

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:34.872 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN I AM I'M SORRY YOU

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:37.541 region:rollup2
CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT.

00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:38.943 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS NUMBER OF AID

00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:40.711 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS CONFERENCE IT PROGRAM

00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:42.413 region:rollup2
SO ARE AMONGST THE MOST GENEROUS

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:43.814 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY ARGUABLY THE MOST

00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:45.349 region:rollup2
GENEROUS.

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:47.518 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE TWELVE ON

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:49.086 region:rollup2
PAGE SIXTEEN YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:51.922 region:rollup2
THE AID PROGRAMS ARE LARGELY

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:54.158 region:rollup2
WORKING AS INTENDED.

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:55.226 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST LOOKING

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:57.428 region:rollup2
AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

00:49:55.226 --> 00:49:59.129 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AS AT THE LOWEST INCOME

00:49:57.428 --> 00:50:01.131 region:rollup2
FAMILY THOSE MAKING UNDER THIRTY

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:02.733 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. YOU CAN SEE THAT NOT

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.868 region:rollup2
PRICE FOR THIS FAMILY IS A

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:05.870 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LESS THAN SIX

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:07.872 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU CAN SEE AS

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:09.807 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S INCOME LEVELS GO UP THE

00:50:07.872 --> 00:50:11.709 region:rollup2
NAP PRICE GOES UP.

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:12.843 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT

00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:14.278 region:rollup2
FOR THIS COMMUNICATES STUDENT

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.779 region:rollup2
THEIR TUITION WOULD BE COVERED

00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:17.982 region:rollup2
SO THE SIX THOUSAND WOULD BE ON

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:19.283 region:rollup2
MATT LIVING COSTS IF THE STUDENT

00:50:17.982 --> 00:50:20.851 region:rollup2
WERE TO WORK FIFTEEN HOURS A

00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:22.353 region:rollup2
WEEK DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR AND

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.420 region:rollup2
FULL TIME DURING THE SUMMER AT

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:24.822 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE THAT MAKE. ABOUT

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.090 region:rollup2
EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO JUST

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:27.591 region:rollup2
TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT OF WHAT

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.560 region:rollup2
THIS LOOKS LIKE. AT THE STUDENT

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:30.961 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.396 region:rollup2
SO MAKING JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:35.733 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY IS AND THEN

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:37.501 region:rollup2
FINISHING WITH THAT COLLEGES.

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:39.670 region:rollup2

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:43.207 region:rollup2
USE INSTANCE YOUR EMPLOYEE

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:44.074 region:rollup2
COMPLICATE POLITELY.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:46.944 region:rollup2
SO THINKING ABOUT EMPLOYEE COM.

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:48.913 region:rollup2
AND.

00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:51.348 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE EIGHTEEN

00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:53.350 region:rollup2
ON PAGE TWENTY THREE.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:55.986 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU CAN SEE JUST A

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:57.988 region:rollup2
COMPARISON OF UC FULL PROFESSOR

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
AVERAGE SALARIES COMPARED TO

00:50:57.988 --> 00:51:02.326 region:rollup2
SOME SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS.

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:03.994 region:rollup2
I'M AYE BOTH YOU CA AND CSU THE

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:05.696 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT DATA SUGGESTING THAT

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:08.265 region:rollup2
SALARIES ARE STILL COMPETITIVE.

00:51:05.696 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
THIS SHOWS THAT BEAR HIGHER THAN

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:12.670 region:rollup2
THAT FOR PUBLIC COMPARISON

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:15.339 region:rollup2

BUFFALO URBANA CHAMPAIGN. AS

00:51:15.339 --> 00:51:18.509 region:rollup2
WELL AS NOTABLY HIGHER THAN ALL

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.144 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PUBLIC RESEARCH

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:51:20.144 --> 00:51:23.781 region:rollup2
I'M FIRST YES YOU THE MOST

00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:25.182 region:rollup2
RECENT STUDY SHOWS THAT FACULTY

00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:28.352 region:rollup2
SALARIES ARE AT SLIGHTLY ABOVE

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:29.820 region:rollup2
SIMILAR COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS.

00:51:28.352 --> 00:51:31.188 region:rollup2
THE DATA WE ALSO HAVE ON WHETHER

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.723 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO GET

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:34.625 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRST CHOICE CANDIDATE

00:51:32.723 --> 00:51:35.793 region:rollup2
SHOW THAT IT STILL HIGH. THAT

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:38.462 region:rollup2
TURNOVER RATES ARE STILL VERY

00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:39.363 region:rollup2
LOW.

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:42.132 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT.

00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:44.501 region:rollup2
CS YOU HAVE FROM THE MID TWENTY

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:46.070 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TO MED TWENTY NINETEEN

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:47.604 region:rollup2
AND YOU LOOK AT THEIR CONTRACTS

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.373 region:rollup2
THE CUMULATIVE GENERAL SALARY

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:51.642 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE SEVENTEEN POINT SIX

00:51:49.373 --> 00:51:53.711 region:rollup2
PERCENT TAX YES YOU. SO NOTABLY

00:51:51.642 --> 00:51:57.715 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT I'M SOME OTHER STATE

00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:58.716 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE GROUPS ARE RECEIVING.

00:51:57.715 --> 00:52:03.053 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AT CAPITAL OUTLAY.

00:51:58.716 --> 00:52:04.989 region:rollup2
.

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:13.831 region:rollup2
IF YOU I'D TURN TO FIGURE TWENTY

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:15.532 region:rollup2
EIGHT PAGE FORTY.

00:52:13.831 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
I'M I'M SORRY I'M IT FIGURE

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:19.703 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE ON PAGE TWENTY NINE

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:23.774 region:rollup2
STARTED TO SUCH A STRICT.

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:25.876 region:rollup2
.

00:52:23.774 --> 00:52:27.011 region:rollup2
SO ADAM IS SO I'M CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:29.279 region:rollup2
HERE WE JUST HAVE WE HAVE STE

00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:30.581 region:rollup2
NOTABLE ISSUES WITH BOTH UC AND

00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:32.383 region:rollup2
CSU IS CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:34.018 region:rollup2
THEY WANNA JUST EMPHASIZE THREE.

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:35.419 region:rollup2
I'M OUR FIRST IS HAVING TO DO

00:52:34.018 --> 00:52:37.354 region:rollup2
WITH THE JUSTIFICATION FOR NEW

00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:39.023 region:rollup2
SPACE NORMALLY WHEN THE SEGMENTS

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:40.658 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE MET AND REQUEST YOU

00:52:39.023 --> 00:52:42.026 region:rollup2
FOR NEW SPACE. THEY WERE TOLD

00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:44.228 region:rollup2
TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF EXISTING

00:52:42.026 --> 00:52:45.796 region:rollup2
SPACE IS BEING USED THEY WOULD

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:47.364 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT SUMMER AND TO THE

00:52:45.796 --> 00:52:49.633 region:rollup2
EXTENT THEY'RE USING SOME ARE.

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:50.401 region:rollup2
AYE WE DIDN'T GET THAT KIND OF

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.935 region:rollup2
QUALITY BACK UP THIS YEAR.

00:52:50.401 --> 00:52:53.871 region:rollup2
AND WHEN IT COMES TO JUSTIFY A

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:55.906 region:rollup2
NEW FACILITIES WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:57.641 region:rollup2
UC SYSTEM WIDE THERE'S NOTABLE

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:58.909 region:rollup2
EXISTING ON YOU'D SPACE WHEN YOU

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.444 region:rollup2
LOOK AT MOST CSU CAMPUSES

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:01.945 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ACCOUNTING FOR SOME

00:53:00.444 --> 00:53:03.814 region:rollup2
ARE. THERE'S NOTABLE EXISTING

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:05.616 region:rollup2
CAPACITY.

00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:07.484 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND NOTABLE CONCERN IS

00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:08.786 region:rollup2
WITH CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO HERE

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:11.221 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT FIGURE TWENTY

00:53:08.786 --> 00:53:13.524 region:rollup2
THREE ON PAGE TWENTY NINE. UC

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:15.192 region:rollup2
HAS SUBMITTED REQUESTS FOR FOR

00:53:13.524 --> 00:53:16.493 region:rollup2
NEW ACADEMIC BUILDINGS.

00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:18.295 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE AVERAGE

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:20.064 region:rollup2
COST PER ASSIGNABLE SQUARE FOOT

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:22.666 region:rollup2
IS VARYING FROM A LOW OF SEVEN

00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:24.201 region:rollup2
HUNDRED ROUGHLY AT SAN DIEGO TO

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.769 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:26.670 region:rollup2
SQUARE FOOT AT SANTA CRUZ.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:28.138 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT BEEN

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.907 region:rollup2
EXPLAINED BY THE TYPE OF SPACE

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:34.111 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS PRIMARILY A CLASSROOM

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:35.446 region:rollup2
SPACE FACULTY OFFICE SPACE.

00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:37.081 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THE EARLY

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:38.315 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSANDS CSU HAD

00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:39.616 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COSTS GUIDELINES

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.551 region:rollup2
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.152 region:rollup2
STILL INTERNALLY HAVE

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:44.088 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COSTS GUIDELINES WE

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:45.589 region:rollup2
DID AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW BACK IN

00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:46.957 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO OF THOSE.

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:48.225 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND CONCLUDED THEY

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.727 region:rollup2
WERE REASONABLE.

00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:51.028 region:rollup2
ALL WE DID THIS TIME IS TAKE THE

00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:52.796 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION COST

00:53:51.028 --> 00:53:54.565 region:rollup2
INDEX AN UPDATE THOSE IF YOU

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:56.100 region:rollup2
WERE TO DO THAT THE GOING RATE

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:57.601 region:rollup2
FOR A CLASSROOM WOULD BE FOUR

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.036 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS PER

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:00.504 region:rollup2
SQUARE FOOT. IF YOU DID A FOR

00:53:59.036 --> 00:54:01.839 region:rollup2
OFFICE SPACE A BEFORE HUNDRED

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
AND FORTY THREE DOLLARS PER

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:04.141 region:rollup2
SQUARE FOOT.

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:05.876 region:rollup2
SO THESE RATES ARE NOTABLY

00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:07.411 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:08.912 region:rollup2
JUST AS A REMINDER OF THE

00:54:07.411 --> 00:54:10.681 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR WHEN THEY TRIED THIS

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.583 region:rollup2
NEW CAP OUTLAY SYSTEM OF

00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:14.418 region:rollup2
COLLAPSING CAPITOL IN SUPPORT

00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:15.619 region:rollup2
DID SO WITH THE HOPE THAT IT

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:16.120 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:18.122 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND SUPPORT MORE

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.556 region:rollup2
OBVIOUS.

00:54:18.122 --> 00:54:21.658 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT WOULD CONSTRUCT

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:22.860 region:rollup2
CONTROL CONSTRUCTION COSTS.

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:25.028 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.330 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN SEEN AT ANY OF THE

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:29.533 region:rollup2
SEGMENT SINCE THE STATE STARTED

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:31.268 region:rollup2
THE NEW SYSTEM.

00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:33.103 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:33.270 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND SCOPE AND COST

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:36.673 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:38.542 region:rollup2
.

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:43.914 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK AT NOW FIGURE

00:54:38.542 --> 00:54:45.749 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT PAGE FORTY.

00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:47.451 region:rollup2
THE STATE LAST YEAR PROVE

00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:49.319 region:rollup2
SEVERAL CSU PROJECTS AND SEE IF

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:50.487 region:rollup2
SHE WASN'T ABLE TO PROCEED WITH

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.489 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTS AND IN SOME

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:54.024 region:rollup2
INSTANCES RESUBMITTED THE

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.958 region:rollup2
PROJECTS FOR THIS YEAR.

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:56.794 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE HERE ON FIGURE

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:58.829 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT JUST FOR AN EXAMPLE

00:54:56.794 --> 00:54:59.930 region:rollup2
NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS LAST YEAR

00:54:58.829 --> 00:55:01.598 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.099 region:rollup2
RENOVATION BUILDING THAT WOULD

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.233 region:rollup2
COST FIFTY SEVEN MILLION

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:04.401 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:05.803 region:rollup2
AND THIS YEAR IS ASKING FOR A

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:07.471 region:rollup2
NEW BUILDING THAT WOULD COST A

00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:08.705 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:07.471 --> 00:55:10.340 region:rollup2
AND THE SAN BERNADINE NOPE

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:12.176 region:rollup2
CAMPUS LAST YEAR CAME IN ASKING

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.911 region:rollup2
FOR A NEW BUILDING AT SIXTY

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
SEVEN MILLION AS ASKING THIS

00:55:13.911 --> 00:55:17.481 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR AND A RENOVATED

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:19.483 region:rollup2
BUILDING AN ADDITION OF A

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:21.451 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION.

00:55:19.483 --> 00:55:23.821 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE JUSTIFICATION FOR

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:26.190 region:rollup2
NEW SPACE CONSTRUCTION COSTS PER

00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2
SQUARE FOOT OR SCOPE AND COST

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
CHANGES THESE ARE NOT KINDS OF.

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:31.228 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE WOULD HAVE SEEN AS

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:33.230 region:rollup2
NOTABLY UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM SO

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:35.165 region:rollup2
WE THINK THESE ARE ALL. A REALLY

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:37.601 region:rollup2
SERIOUS SIGNALS OF A PROBLEM

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:39.136 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEW SYSTEM.

00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:40.337 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS WITH

00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:41.738 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSALS THAT WE GOT WE ARE

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:43.774 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THAT THE STATEMENTS

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:44.408 region:rollup2
REVISIT THEM RESUBMIT THEM TO

00:55:43.774 --> 00:55:46.243 region:rollup2
USE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER

00:55:44.408 --> 00:55:47.644 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION ON BEFORE YOU

00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:48.745 region:rollup2
PROCEED FORWARD.

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:50.447 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T GET BETTER

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:52.015 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION I'M WORSE

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:53.717 region:rollup2
ADJUSTING THAT FIRST ISSUE FOR

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:55.152 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THESE PROJECTS THAT THEY

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.386 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO DO ARE ASSOCIATED

00:55:55.152 --> 00:55:58.422 region:rollup2
WITH AN INCREASE IN DEBT SERVICE

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:59.723 region:rollup2
COSTS OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION.

00:55:58.422 --> 00:56:01.058 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED THE BUT

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:02.392 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST YOU WOULD TAKE THAT

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:04.728 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN MILLION A REPURPOSE

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:07.764 region:rollup2
THAT FOR HIGHER. UP PRIORITIES

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:09.499 region:rollup2
WITHIN YOUR BUDGET.

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:11.668 region:rollup2
AB SO I GET AGAIN BECAUSE THE

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:13.670 region:rollup2
COSTS HAVE BEEN SO HIGH AND

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:14.571 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SCOPE AND COST

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.340 region:rollup2
CHANGES HAPPEN SO NOTABLE WE

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:18.041 region:rollup2
HAVE. A PARTICULARLY SERIOUS

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.042 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THE SHARE.

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.410 region:rollup2
SO FINALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.945 region:rollup2
COLLEGES YOU'VE HEARD LOTS ABOUT

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.647 region:rollup2
THE ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSAL LOTS

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:25.482 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE APPORTIONMENT FUNDING

00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:27.651 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL I'LL JUST SHARE OFFICES

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:28.685 region:rollup2
GENERAL FEEDBACK. ON BOTH SO

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:30.354 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:32.322 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT FORMULA AYE WE

00:56:30.354 --> 00:56:34.291 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO TRY OUT

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:35.993 region:rollup2
DOING LAST IN A APPORTIONMENT

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:38.228 region:rollup2
FUNDING BASED ON ENROLLMENT SOME

00:56:35.993 --> 00:56:39.963 region:rollup2
PORTION BASED ON PERFORMANCE.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:41.531 region:rollup2
THIRTY OTHER STATES HAVE SOME

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:43.700 region:rollup2
MONEY LINKED TO PERFORMANCE

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:45.168 region:rollup2
BASED FUNDING. THOSE STATES THAT

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.537 region:rollup2
DO RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IT

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:48.772 region:rollup2
DOES CHANGE COLLEGE BEHAVIOR

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:51.408 region:rollup2
THEY DO THINGS LIKE HIGHER MORE

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:53.176 region:rollup2
TUTORS HIRE MORE ADVISERS FOCUS

00:56:51.408 --> 00:56:54.444 region:rollup2
MORE ON BASIC SKILLS INSTRUCTION

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:56.079 region:rollup2
TRY TO STREAMLINE COURSE

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:57.814 region:rollup2
ARTICULATION.

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:59.082 region:rollup2
THERE IS LIMITED DATA TODAY THAT

00:56:57.814 --> 00:57:01.385 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS STUDENT OUTCOMES

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:02.986 region:rollup2
IMPROVE NOTABLY BUT IT'S SO

00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:04.755 region:rollup2
COULD BE WORTH TRYING SAID GET

00:57:02.986 --> 00:57:05.923 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO START DOING THOSE

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:09.026 region:rollup2
THINGS IF YOU WERE TO DEEMED

00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:11.762 region:rollup2
THAT POSITIVE THINGS.

00:57:09.026 --> 00:57:13.597 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO PROCEED DOWN THE ROAD

00:57:11.762 --> 00:57:15.299 region:rollup2
OF PLACING SOME MONEY I'M MORE

00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:16.700 region:rollup2
OF IT BASED UPON PERFORMANCE WE

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:18.268 region:rollup2
JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO LINK IT

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:20.203 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY AT LEAST A SMALL

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:21.772 region:rollup2
PORTION OF IT OR SOME PORTION OF

00:57:20.203 --> 00:57:23.974 region:rollup2
IT. TO HOW LOW INCOME UNLESS

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:25.709 region:rollup2
PREPARED STUDENTS PERFORM NOT

00:57:23.974 --> 00:57:27.978 region:rollup2
JUST ON ROLLING THEM BUT GETTING

00:57:25.709 --> 00:57:30.547 region:rollup2
THEM TO SUCCEED WITH DEGREES IN

00:57:27.978 --> 00:57:33.617 region:rollup2
A TIMELY FASHION.

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:35.285 region:rollup2
FINALLY ON THE ONLINE COLLEGE

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:36.553 region:rollup2
JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK THE

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:38.588 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WHAT IT REALLY

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:40.057 region:rollup2
BELIEVES ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:42.693 region:rollup2
THE WORD THE ROOT ISSUE US.

00:57:40.057 --> 00:57:44.394 region:rollup2
I WHY ISN'T THAT ADULTS WORKING

00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:45.762 region:rollup2
ADULTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:48.231 region:rollup2
OPTIONS THAT THEY WANT WITH AN

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:49.700 region:rollup2
EXISTING COLLEGE SYSTEM TODAY.

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:51.568 region:rollup2
I'M A WHY IS IT THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.436 region:rollup2
AVAILING THEMSELVES OF OPTIONS

00:57:51.568 --> 00:57:54.137 region:rollup2
WHAT PARTICULAR OPTIONS WHAT

00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:55.272 region:rollup2
THEY LIKE.

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:56.740 region:rollup2
WE THINK ONCE YOU HAVE A BETTER

00:57:55.272 --> 00:57:58.342 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM

00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.077 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO TARGET THE ROOT

00:57:58.342 --> 00:58:02.479 region:rollup2
CAUSES OF THOSE PROBLEMS YOU

00:58:00.077 --> 00:58:04.014 region:rollup2
COULD CONSIDER. OTHER SOLUTIONS

00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:06.049 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS MAYBE EVEN WITHIN THE

00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:07.150 region:rollup2
EXISTING SYSTEM HAVING SAID THAT

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.452 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE HARD TO CHANGE THE

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES OF THE EXISTING

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:11.088 region:rollup2
SYSTEM YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ASK

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
YOURSELVES WHY. WHY AREN'T

00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:14.391 region:rollup2
COLLEGES OFFERING COURSES AT

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.193 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT TIMES OF DAY

00:58:14.391 --> 00:58:17.527 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT TIMES OF THE WEEK WHY

00:58:16.193 --> 00:58:18.128 region:rollup2
AREN'T THEY MORE FLEXIBLE IN

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:20.097 region:rollup2
FORMAT?

00:58:18.128 --> 00:58:22.499 region:rollup2
?

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:24.134 region:rollup2
AND THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WHY

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:25.802 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY ISN'T PARTNERING WITH

00:58:24.134 --> 00:58:27.270 region:rollup2
COLLEGES IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:28.772 region:rollup2
WORKING ADULTS HAVE ON THE JOB

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.340 region:rollup2
TRAINING EXPERIENCES ON

00:58:28.772 --> 00:58:32.042 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND TRAINING A MORE IS

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.744 region:rollup2
MORE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED. SO

00:58:32.042 --> 00:58:35.712 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO

00:58:33.744 --> 00:58:37.347 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT RELIGION ISSUES TO

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:39.349 region:rollup2
SIFT THROUGH ALL THE POSSIBLE

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:40.717 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES BEFORE YOU LAND ON

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:42.252 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE THE MOST

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:42.753 region:rollup2
COST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE.

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:44.755 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE AN ANSWER ANY

00:58:42.753 --> 00:58:47.424 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:58:44.755 --> 00:58:49.426 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:58:47.424 --> 00:58:50.827 region:rollup2

GIVING YOU COULD INCLUDE YOU SEE

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:55.866 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:57.034 region:rollup2
.

00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:58.935 region:rollup2
DID YOU EXAMINE HOW HOW HOW THE

00:58:57.034 --> 00:59:00.604 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:02.305 region:rollup2
HOW THE PROCURED AT AT AT A

00:59:00.604 --> 00:59:03.807 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC CSU IN OTHER WORDS ARE

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:05.442 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THESE?

00:59:03.807 --> 00:59:06.977 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THE UNIVERSITY OF THE.

00:59:05.442 --> 00:59:09.613 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES IF YOU WILL.

00:59:06.977 --> 00:59:11.114 region:rollup2
OPERATING SEPARATELY.

00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:13.350 region:rollup2
DO THEY GO THROUGH IS THERE SOME

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:15.285 region:rollup2
CENTRALIZED PROTOCOL.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:16.787 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S OVERSIGHT?

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:19.022 region:rollup2
AND AND NOW I HAVE A SECOND

00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:19.589 region:rollup2
QUESTION THERE IN YOU MAY KNOW

MAYBE LOOK TO THIS.

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:25.695 region:rollup2
ARE THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:27.330 region:rollup2
ON CAMPUS SHARING SPACE.

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:29.099 region:rollup2
SO HEY YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE THE.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.1000 region:rollup2
MEN OF THIS DEPARTMENT AT THAT

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:31.435 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE BUILDING

00:59:29.1000 --> 00:59:32.436 region:rollup2
NOBODY ELSE CAN COME AND BUT YOU

00:59:31.435 --> 00:59:34.004 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU NEED TO SPACE YOUR

00:59:32.436 --> 00:59:34.805 region:rollup2
OTHER DEPARTMENT. SHE WILL

00:59:34.004 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BUILD

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:38.375 region:rollup2
SOME NEW SOME NEW US A NEW SPACE

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.943 region:rollup2
TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT I DID

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:41.912 region:rollup2
YOU INVESTIGATE ANY THAT. HAVE

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:43.246 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE FIRST POINT WE HAS

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:45.749 region:rollup2
AN OFFICE HAVE HAD A LONG

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:47.884 region:rollup2
STANDING CONCERN THAT.

00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:49.820 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL OFFICES WHETHER IT

00:59:47.884 --> 00:59:51.922 region:rollup2
BE SERIOUS YOU OR YOU SEE THEY

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:53.123 region:rollup2
TEND TO TAKE THE A PROJECTS THAT

00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:54.558 region:rollup2
OUR SUBMITTED FROM THE SEGMENTS

00:59:53.123 --> 00:59:56.426 region:rollup2
AND.

00:59:54.558 --> 00:59:57.961 region:rollup2
BEING OVERLY SIMPLISTIC MAKING

00:59:56.426 --> 01:00:00.197 region:rollup2
SURE CAMPUSES GET STUFF EVERY SO

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:01.998 region:rollup2
OFTEN WITHOUT DECIDING

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:03.700 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY WHICH CAMPUS TO

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:06.236 region:rollup2
GET THE NEXT PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.370 region:rollup2
BASED ON A SYSTEM WIDE PLAN.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:08.972 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.307 region:rollup2
IS AND THAT'S WHERE EXISTING

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ARE BEING USED AT

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:13.577 region:rollup2
CAPACITY. IT DOESN'T FUNDS THE

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:15.011 region:rollup2
BEADS ON ONE THOUGHT SORT OF

01:00:13.577 --> 01:00:16.646 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC VISION OF WHAT THE

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:18.482 region:rollup2
SYSTEM NEEDS WHERE IT NEEDS IT

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:20.083 region:rollup2
WHEN IT NEEDS IT IT TENDS TO BE

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.518 region:rollup2
OF SPECIFIC CAMPUS HOW THE

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.386 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT'S AGING AND WOULD

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:25.555 region:rollup2
LIKE TO MODERNIZE AT SO IT'S

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:27.524 region:rollup2
VERY CAMPUS SPECIFIC. IT DOESN'T

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:29.126 region:rollup2
HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE MUCH LESS A

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:30.393 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE FOCUSED.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.628 region:rollup2
NOT BEING SENT THAT PART OF THE

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:33.029 region:rollup2
JOB YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THAT'S

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:35.031 region:rollup2
OUR JOB OR DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:37.000 region:rollup2
FINANCES JOB BUT UNDER THE NEW

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:38.869 region:rollup2
CAPABLY SYSTEM THESE PROJECT

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.637 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY.

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:42.305 region:rollup2
GIVEN A REALLY THOROUGH I'LL

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.773 region:rollup2
LOOK INTO.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:45.342 region:rollup2
THE STATE IN THE PAST HAS HAD

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:46.843 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:49.212 region:rollup2
SPACE FOR CLASSROOMS FOR

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:51.047 region:rollup2
TEACHING LAB SCIENCE LABS.

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.715 region:rollup2
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A SPECIFIC AS

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.984 region:rollup2
REQUIRING.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:55.619 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT LEVEL DATA SO AS A

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:57.687 region:rollup2
STATE WE'VE NEVER HAD THAT NOW

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:59.022 region:rollup2
IT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAPPENS

01:00:57.687 --> 01:01:00.157 region:rollup2
I SUSPECT IT MIGHT HAPPEN IF

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:02.292 region:rollup2
THERE'S TO SCIENCE BUILDINGS

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:05.295 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLOSE BY THEN MAYBE THE

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:06.630 region:rollup2
LABS ARE WILLING TO. IN CERTAIN

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:08.398 region:rollup2
TIMES THE EFFORT OF THE STATE

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.833 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE GUIDELINES WHEN THEY

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:11.334 region:rollup2
WERE REALLY USED ON IN FOREST

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.802 region:rollup2
WAS THAT. THE STATE WOULD BE

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.437 region:rollup2
STUDYING THESE AGGREGATE WE WANT

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
TEACHING LABS TO BE IS A CERTAIN

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:17.641 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DAYS A WEEK A CERTAIN

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:18.875 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF HOURS WITH DUST FILLED

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:20.076 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME YOU GO

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:22.913 region:rollup2
FORTH UNIVERSE INTO TO MAKE THAT

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:23.480 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WILL GIVE YOU FLEXIBILITY

01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:23.914 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE IT AT. THE CAMPUS

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.815 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:27.350 region:rollup2
BUT MANY OF THE SORT OF

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:29.152 region:rollup2
WATCHDOG FUNCTION HAS

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:31.421 region:rollup2
DETERIORATED OVER THE YEARS.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:33.023 region:rollup2
AND HOW WOULD THAT.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:34.291 region:rollup2
WHAT WE THERE HELLO WATCHDOG

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
FUNCTION MIGHT OCCUR THERE WOULD

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:39.062 region:rollup2
BE AT THE CHANCELLOR'S LEVEL

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.297 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY? AND WHAT SOME.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.997 region:rollup2
OFFICER OFFICER WITHIN. THAT

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:43.967 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:44.467 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:46.736 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK AND OTHER.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:49.573 region:rollup2
HISTORIC.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:51.274 region:rollup2
PROCESS HAS BEEN THAT THE STATE

01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:53.810 region:rollup2
HAS STATUTORY LEGIT LEGISLATIVE

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF SPACE.

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:57.948 region:rollup2
FOUR WHAT'S ENTAILED TO HAVE

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:59.416 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FOR NEW SPACE.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:00.417 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.618 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE IF THEY WERE GOING TO

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.452 region:rollup2
SUBMIT A PROPOSAL THEY WOULD

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:04.087 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ADHERE TO THOSE

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.755 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:07.224 region:rollup2
FINANCE WOULD REJECT LOTS OF

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:09.059 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT JUST SENATE MEET

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.627 region:rollup2
THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN WE

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.728 region:rollup2
MIGHT SUGGEST YEARS JACKSON

01:02:10.627 --> 01:02:13.096 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT DONE THAT MEET

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.664 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTS AND YOU WOULD

01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:16.166 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND REJECT THEM ASK

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:17.534 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE RESUBMITTED ONCE THEY

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:19.102 region:rollup2
HAD BETTER DOCUMENTATION OR ASK

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:21.371 region:rollup2
THE SEGMENTS OF RESUBMIT A. NEW

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.405 region:rollup2
LIST PROJECTS TO THAT DID MEET

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:23.773 region:rollup2
YOUR PRIORITIES.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:25.976 region:rollup2
ON THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH A

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:28.044 region:rollup2
SORT OF APPROVAL OF PROJECTS HAS

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:31.481 region:rollup2
BECOME MUCH MORE PRO FORMA.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:32.549 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.684 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARTUCCI THANK

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:36.686 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:38.355 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO.

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:45.262 region:rollup2
ASSN QUESTIONS RICK RELATE TO

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:47.631 region:rollup2
FIGURE SEVEN.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:49.199 region:rollup2
SO ACCORDING TO FIGURE SEVEN

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:52.035 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOWS THE.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:54.537 region:rollup2
PER P. PER STUDENT FUNDING.

01:02:52.035 --> 01:02:56.439 region:rollup2
FOR THE THREE SEGMENTS.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:59.476 region:rollup2
I IT IT IT SEEMS THAT.

01:02:56.439 --> 01:03:00.076 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE THE CSU AND THE

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:03.146 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGE FUNDING. EL

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:07.217 region:rollup2
IS.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:08.918 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH AT OR NEAR THE PEAK.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:11.054 region:rollup2
A OVER THE LAST SIX. MINUTES OF

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:13.857 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:15.325 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA PER

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:17.827 region:rollup2
STUDENT FUNDING DRAMATICALLY

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:19.329 region:rollup2
DROPPED AFTER NINETEEN NINETY

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:20.830 region:rollup2
EIGHT PER OR THEREABOUTS. AND.

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:23.099 region:rollup2
.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:25.769 region:rollup2
IS AND HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:27.237 region:rollup2
GET BACK TO WHERE IT WAS ONCE

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:28.872 region:rollup2
IN THE LATE NINETIES IS IS THAT

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:31.207 region:rollup2
I ACCURATE TO.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:31.808 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION OF YOU OF FIGURE

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:34.277 region:rollup2
SEVEN I THINK IT IS YEAH OKAY

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:36.713 region:rollup2
SO.

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.980 region:rollup2
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.882 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:41.384 region:rollup2
Y..

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:43.253 region:rollup2
THE A STATE PER STUDENT FUNDING

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:44.421 region:rollup2
HAS DRAMATICALLY DROP. IN

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:45.889 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FOR THE UNIVERSITY

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:47.090 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY RELATIVE

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.558 region:rollup2
TO THE CAL STATE IN THE

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.360 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:52.962 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ARE THE.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.732 region:rollup2
BIGGEST BARRIERS TOWARD

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:56.232 region:rollup2
RESTORING THAT LOST UNIVERSITY

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:58.334 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA A PER STUDENT

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:59.436 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.570 region:rollup2
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:03:59.436 --> 01:04:01.638 region:rollup2
YOU SEE AND ACTUALLY BECAUSE

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.639 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:04.407 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THAT THE

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:05.675 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ARE WITHIN NINETY EIGHT

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:07.477 region:rollup2
AND THEIR FUNDING IS BEING

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.812 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY IT SORT OF FORMULAS

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:10.714 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN GENERALLY GROWING

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:13.650 region:rollup2
OVER TIME. IN EXCESS OF

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:15.218 region:rollup2
INFLATION. AYE IS MORE DIFFICULT

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.954 region:rollup2
TO PINPOINT THE DIFFERENCES IN

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:19.289 region:rollup2
UC AND CSU DID YOU SEE STARTED A

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:21.324 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HIGH LEVEL AND THEN

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
WHEN THE STATE HIT THE RECESSION

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:24.661 region:rollup2
THAT PURPOSELY WANT TO MAKE SOME

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:27.063 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS THE STATE. HAS MADE

01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:27.630 region:rollup2
SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO TRY TO BUILD

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.933 region:rollup2
UP CSU FUNDING A LITTLE BIT

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:32.635 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:35.238 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A PRIORITIZATION THAT

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:36.473 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD A FOR A

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.609 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS.

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:41.611 region:rollup2
HOW FOR EXAMPLE OUT AWHILE AGO

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:43.580 region:rollup2
VCS USE BASED INCREASED WAS

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.981 region:rollup2
LINKED TO UC'S BASING CHRIS EVEN

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.350 region:rollup2
THOUGH AT THE TIME YOU SEE HOW

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:50.053 region:rollup2
TO HIRE A BASE SO THAT WAS ONE

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:51.454 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO JUST? PRIORITIZE THE

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:54.424 region:rollup2
ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:55.925 region:rollup2
AND AND IT HAS BEEN GROWING.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:58.595 region:rollup2
MORE NOTABLY BUT.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:05:00.764 region:rollup2
IT IN RECENT YEARS BUT AGAIN AT.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:02.966 region:rollup2
IT LARGELY COMES I THINK TO JUST

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:05.869 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES OF THE STATE AND HOW

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:07.871 region:rollup2
IT'S DECIDED TO. ITEM. AND MAKE

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:10.206 region:rollup2
THESE DECISIONS AT BOTH UC AND

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:11.608 region:rollup2
CSU FEES WENT UP VERY STEEPLY

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:14.144 region:rollup2
DURING THE RECESSION.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:15.912 region:rollup2
AT AND THE STATE BUDGET.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:17.914 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND WENT DOWN FOR BOTH

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.215 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS I THINK PART OF THIS IS

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.617 region:rollup2
JUST COMING OUT OF THAT WITH THE

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:22.018 region:rollup2
STATE'S PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN AND

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.986 region:rollup2
EVEN DURING THE RECESSION WHAT

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.754 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:27.123 region:rollup2
BUTTON BUT AGAIN I MEAN LOOK AT

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.858 region:rollup2
THIS GRAPH IT DOES SEEM TO BE

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:31.461 region:rollup2
STRENGTH EATEN LEAD DIFFERENT

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:33.897 region:rollup2
FROM. THE CSU INCOMING COLLEGE

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.831 region:rollup2
IS A. THERE IS THERE ANYTHING TO

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:37.467 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:38.968 region:rollup2
LIKE OFTEN WE WE HEAR THAT THE.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.537 region:rollup2
THEY DID THE REASON WHY THE

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:42.772 region:rollup2
UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA OF

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:44.908 region:rollup2
FUNDING HAS DROPPED IS BECAUSE

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:46.476 region:rollup2
OF THE RECESSION. BUT IT LOOKS

01:05:44.908 --> 01:05:49.345 region:rollup2
LIKE THE THE DROPS.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:51.848 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NO PRECEDED AND EVEN

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:53.183 region:rollup2
CONTINUE DURING THE DOT COM BOOM

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:54.584 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE GREAT RISK RECESSION

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:56.820 region:rollup2
OF A.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:57.954 region:rollup2
DIDN'T START AROUND OH SEVEN OO

01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.722 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.925 region:rollup2
ANY ANY.

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:03.026 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THAT.

01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.060 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:05.862 region:rollup2
SPECULATION.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.031 region:rollup2
BUT I MEAN I WAS HERE DURING

01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:09.599 region:rollup2
THE LATE NINETIES AND THERE WAS

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:11.134 region:rollup2
A LOT OF EFFECTIVELY

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:12.936 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES SINCE

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:16.406 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S FISCAL SITUATION WAS

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:18.274 region:rollup2
GOOD. AND IS LOOKS LIKE FROM THE

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:18.875 region:rollup2
GRAPH THAT THE STATE AND I THINK

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:21.044 region:rollup2
WE CAN SOME OF US REMEMBER THE

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:22.445 region:rollup2
A.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.313 region:rollup2
STATE KINDS OF THINGS THE STATE

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:25.281 region:rollup2
DEAD IN THE LATE NINETEEN

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:26.783 region:rollup2
NINETIES THAT BENEFITTED YOU SEE

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:29.085 region:rollup2
IT APPEARS THAT IT DID THAT SORT

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:31.488 region:rollup2
OF DISPROPORTIONATELY TO CS YOU.

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:33.389 region:rollup2
SEE YOU SEE THEN WAS AND TRAIN.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:35.225 region:rollup2
THE DOT COM BUST AT A HIGHER

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:36.993 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND SO THAT'S WHEN YOU GET

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:38.628 region:rollup2
TO THE DOT COM BUST YOU SEE THAT

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.230 region:rollup2
SORT OF TEMPORARY LATE NINETIES

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.998 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SPENDING SORT OF CUT

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:44.400 region:rollup2
AS THE FIRST THING TO GO. NOW IS

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:45.635 region:rollup2
THAT A SIGN THAT SOME OF THAT

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.070 region:rollup2
FUNDING IT WAS

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:48.538 region:rollup2
REALLY SORT OF ADDITIONAL

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.807 region:rollup2
BENEFIT BECAUSE THE STATE TIMES

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:52.041 region:rollup2
WERE SO GOOD I'M SURE YOU SEE IT

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:53.042 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:54.944 region:rollup2
AND BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:56.679 region:rollup2
REALLY CRUCIAL. AN EXTRA

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.814 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATIONS DURING THAT TIME

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:59.582 region:rollup2
BUT THAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS A

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:01.050 region:rollup2
TOUCH OF THAT AGAIN THIS IS JUST

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.986 region:rollup2
ALL ABOUT THE STATE'S PRIORITIES

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:06.689 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THANK YOU.

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:10.627 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR MEDINA BUT BUT ON

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.995 region:rollup2
THIS POINT I WILL NOTE THAT THIS

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:14.030 region:rollup2
ISN'T JUST GENERAL FUND HERE

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:16.232 region:rollup2
THIS IS COR FUNDS ARE STUDENT

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:18.034 region:rollup2
FEES SO. WHEN THEY INCREASE

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:19.802 region:rollup2
STUDENT FEES ARE NON STUDENT.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.337 region:rollup2
PARA STATE.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:22.972 region:rollup2
REVENUE THIS IS ALL PART OF THAT

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:24.507 region:rollup2
SAME RIGHT AGENT BECAUSE GENERAL

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:26.109 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL OCEAN FROM THE

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:27.677 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY'S VANTAGE POINT IS

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:29.012 region:rollup2
FUNGIBLE THEY USE BOTH FUNDS

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:31.114 region:rollup2
SOURCES TO RUN THEIR CORE

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:33.483 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS WE LOOK. NOT ONLY FOR

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:34.751 region:rollup2
YOU SEE AT STATE GENERAL FUND

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:36.085 region:rollup2
AND RESIDENTS WHO WISH ON THAT

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:38.121 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY USE SOME NON

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:40.290 region:rollup2
RESIDENT TUITION SO CROSS

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.723 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE THEIR CORE PROGRAM. WE

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:43.326 region:rollup2
INCLUDE EVEN THAT.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:45.194 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:46.963 region:rollup2
MR MEDINA GETS REQUEST QUESTIONS

01:07:45.194 --> 01:07:49.299 region:rollup2
TO.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:51.301 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PERMIT FINEST.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:53.102 region:rollup2
COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW.

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:54.370 region:rollup2
COULD EXPLAIN TO ME HOW. THE

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.204 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR KNOWS THAT THE NEW

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA.

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.941 region:rollup2
WILL WORK.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:00.577 region:rollup2
AS IT PERTAINS TO COMMUNITY

01:07:57.941 --> 01:08:03.046 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.747 region:rollup2
SURE SO I. AM JUST STEPPING BACK

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:06.883 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:09.485 region:rollup2
EXISTING AT FUNDING FORMULA AND

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:11.854 region:rollup2
THE IT AND IT CONCERNS I'M. WITH

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.188 region:rollup2
DEAFENING FORMULATING HIS BEEN

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:12.855 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS.

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.890 region:rollup2
.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.558 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAMINO

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.160 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:18.795 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING FUNDING FORMULA.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.797 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:22.332 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BASED ON ENROLLMENT

01:08:20.797 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
AND IT MAKES A VERY CHALLENGING.

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:26.669 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:28.938 region:rollup2
COLLEGES I SPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:30.473 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC CHANGES WHEN ENROLLMENT

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:33.543 region:rollup2
WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:35.845 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AT SUPPER WHEN THEY AT

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:37.981 region:rollup2
CANNOT PAT ATTAIN THE A ROMANTIC

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:39.782 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE CHEATING GROWTH AND

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:41.851 region:rollup2
AND AND OPPOSITE HAPPENS WHEN.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:44.053 region:rollup2
AT TIMES ARE ARE BAD SO I THINK

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:45.488 region:rollup2
THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.690 region:rollup2
FUNNY THE EXISTING FUNDING

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:49.292 region:rollup2
FORMULA.

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:51.227 region:rollup2
ISN'T WORKING.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.762 region:rollup2
I THINK WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:55.164 region:rollup2
MODELS WE KNOW THAT OVER THIRTY

01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:57.700 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOME

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:59.469 region:rollup2
TYPE OF A OUTCOMES BASED

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.571 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE SPACE IN THEIR

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:03.773 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA AS A WAY TO AND

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:06.542 region:rollup2
CENTS. UP HERE RURAL

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:08.344 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONAL AYE CHANGES AND

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.013 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ELLIOTT POINTED OUT I

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:13.716 region:rollup2
HAD THE RESEARCH HAS INDICATED

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:17.854 region:rollup2
THAT THIS HAS RESULT HEAD AND.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:20.390 region:rollup2
ABBY HE REALLY CHANGES IN THOSE

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:22.125 region:rollup2
STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED SOME

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:24.227 region:rollup2
SORT OF OUTCOMES IN THEIR

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:26.229 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA.

01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:29.832 region:rollup2
IN THE FUNDING FORMULA ALSO

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:32.068 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL A

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:34.604 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS BASED ON

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:36.372 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:38.441 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT THE DISTRICTS%

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:40.910 region:rollup2
SERVE. AS WE KNOW IT THAT

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:43.646 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THAT

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:49.152 region:rollup2
AREA.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:50.987 region:rollup2
AB COULD BE AT HELPFUL IS SO I

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:55.391 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:55.691 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT TRAITS IS TRYING

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.459 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.293 region:rollup2
VARIOUS CONCERNS AND THAT

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:58.327 region:rollup2
BUILDS ON THE RESEARCH OF WHAT

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.861 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

01:09:58.327 --> 01:09:59.328 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.996 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT THAT THE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:00.530 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONVENED AT

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:01.130 region:rollup2
SEVERAL WORKGROUPS THAT.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:04.734 region:rollup2
CHIEF BEEN PRETTY OPEN THAT WE

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:06.869 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:08.938 region:rollup2
OPEN TO CONSIDERING WHETHER

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:10.039 region:rollup2
THESE ARE AT THE RIGHT FACTORS

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:12.141 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:13.509 region:rollup2
OF FEEDBACK INCLUDING IS THERE A

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:16.646 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY TO PLANNED.

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:18.414 region:rollup2
AT. THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT WITH

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:19.982 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND WE ARE IT CERTAINLY

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:22.051 region:rollup2
TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.785 region:rollup2
BUT WE REALLY THINK THAT BASED

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.987 region:rollup2
ON THE RESEARCH.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:26.856 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON THE CONCERNS OF

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:28.524 region:rollup2
THIS IS A WAY TO ADDRESS MANY OF

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:30.259 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:33.563 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION TO

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:34.797 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S IDEA OF PROPOSAL.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.199 region:rollup2
TO FIND A ONE HUNDRED MILLION

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:39.068 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:41.070 region:rollup2
ONE TIME FOR ONLINE.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.473 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:45.508 region:rollup2
SHOW ME WHAT EVIDENCE WE HAVE

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:47.477 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WOULD ALSO WORK AND

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:50.480 region:rollup2
WHAT EVIDENCE. DOES THE GOVERNOR

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:52.315 region:rollup2
HAVE IN PROPOSING THIS.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.915 region:rollup2
SHIRTS ALL ALL SPEAK A LITTLE

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:55.551 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:57.520 region:rollup2
MAY RESPOND TO SOME SORT OF THE

01:10:55.551 --> 01:11:00.256 region:rollup2
LA ELBOWS AND QUESTION ABOUT

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.724 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ARE AT THE ROOT CAUSES

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:03.760 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:05.428 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.196 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE MILLION WORKING

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.831 region:rollup2
ADULTS AT BETWEEN THE AGES OF

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:10.933 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR WHO

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.502 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A POST SECONDARY.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:14.237 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL WE LOOKED AT THE

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:16.773 region:rollup2
AVERAGE WAGES OF OF THIS

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:18.074 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND WE WE KNOW THAT

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.109 region:rollup2
AT THE AFTER AVERAGE ANNUAL

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:22.044 region:rollup2
WAGES TWENTY THREE AT THE HOUSE

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.746 region:rollup2
AND. WE KNOW THAT.

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:26.449 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:27.784 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS CURRENTLY WORKING.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:32.555 region:rollup2
OUT AND WE KNOW THAT.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:32.855 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT ARE ARE THAT THE

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.157 region:rollup2
NOT. SO I.

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:35.825 region:rollup2
THE THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:39.028 region:rollup2
THERE A OUR INCOME.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:40.563 region:rollup2
UP DISPARITIES AND THAT IS THE

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.597 region:rollup2
THIS IS A POPULATION THAT IS AN

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:44.200 region:rollup2
AXIS SEEN.

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:46.636 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.437 region:rollup2
AND DEMOCRAT COURSES.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:49.839 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE ARE

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:53.176 region:rollup2
WORKING THERE IS A NEED FOR

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:54.110 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE OPTIONS I AM GIVEN

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:56.979 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIAL Y. WORK

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:58.815 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:00.750 region:rollup2
SO WITH SO WHY AREN'T OF THE

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:03.219 region:rollup2
STUDENTS OR THE WORKING ADULTS

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.719 region:rollup2
ACCESS SEEN EXISTING ONLINE

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:04.654 region:rollup2
COURSE AT THE COMMITTEE

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:07.023 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:08.324 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:10.426 region:rollup2
OF ONLINE AT THE COMMITTEE

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.994 region:rollup2
COLLEGES HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:14.330 region:rollup2
THE MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:16.732 region:rollup2
OF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:19.202 region:rollup2
WHO IS SEEKING A GREATER

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:20.036 region:rollup2
TRANSFER TO A UNIVERSITY AND

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:20.870 region:rollup2
WHERE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:23.873 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES?

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:25.141 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO I FACULTY LOAD

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:27.176 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC CALENDARS.

01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:29.378 region:rollup2
AND THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.413 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE ON DEMAND BURST OF

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:33.049 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND.

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:35.585 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A WAY TO PROVIDE A

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:37.486 region:rollup2
TUONO ADD TO PROVIDE A FOCUSED

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:39.522 region:rollup2
EFFORT TO.

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:42.325 region:rollup2
REACHED UP POPULATION AND

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:44.160 region:rollup2
PROVIDE MORE ECONOMIC AND

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:47.163 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.065 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:51.267 region:rollup2
AND LIKE. I WOULD JUST ADD THIS

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:54.270 region:rollup2
IS ALSO A GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:55.705 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.240 region:rollup2
RECESSIONS OCCUR I THINK.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.141 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY SEE THAT THERE'S A

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.544 region:rollup2
BENEFIT TO HELPING THESE

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:03.145 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND THESE ADULTS IN

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:05.648 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FURTHER THEIR.

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:07.183 region:rollup2
INCOME PROSPERITY THEIR

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:08.851 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MOBILITY.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:10.786 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL HELP

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:11.254 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARD AGAINST DOWNTURNS IN

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.922 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMY FOR THOSE

01:13:11.254 --> 01:13:15.291 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.325 region:rollup2
SO I I I HEAR YOU SAYING THERE'S

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:18.594 region:rollup2
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. WORKING

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:19.195 region:rollup2
ADULTS.

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.329 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THOSE BEING

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:20.863 region:rollup2
LATINA.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:23.699 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:25.401 region:rollup2
ACCESS?

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:27.603 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION ARE.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:29.205 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY EIGHT PERCENT OF OF

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:30.706 region:rollup2
THAT TWO POINT FIVE ARE LATINO

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:32.475 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TWO

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.609 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE ARE WORKING WORKING

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:35.578 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT WORKING FORTY

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
PERCENT LATINA.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:38.147 region:rollup2
BUT I DID NOT HEAR IN YOUR

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:40.082 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:41.951 region:rollup2
ANY EVIDENCE

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.853 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:46.255 region:rollup2
OR THIS IS THE WAY THAT WILL

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:47.456 region:rollup2
WORKWITH THESE TWO POINT FIVE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.291 region:rollup2
MILLION AND WHICH IS THE

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.358 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT.

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:50.993 region:rollup2
I ASKED.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:52.928 region:rollup2
.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:55.765 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE BECAUSE

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:57.300 region:rollup2
AS AN EDUCATOR. I'M SKEPTICAL.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:59.068 region:rollup2
AS AN EDUCATOR.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.871 region:rollup2
THIRTY SOME YEARS.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:02.805 region:rollup2
AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:04.340 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:06.943 region:rollup2
BEST WAY.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.445 region:rollup2
OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT TWO

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:10.613 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.349 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT LATINO WILL BE

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:15.351 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:17.086 region:rollup2
IN MY OWN MIND I THINK.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:17.653 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ARE THESE THE STUDENTS

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:21.257 region:rollup2
WHO ARE GONNA HAVE THE MOST

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:23.759 region:rollup2
ABILITY. TO DO ONLINE LEARNING.

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:25.995 region:rollup2
I I KNOW I CAN THINK OF RIGHT

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
AWAY THE SAN JOSE STATE. A STUDY

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:28.764 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWED THAT STUDENTS HAD A

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.800 region:rollup2
HARD TIME.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:32.501 region:rollup2
BEING SUCCESSFUL WITH ONLINE

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.838 region:rollup2
LEARNING HOW DO I KNOW.

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:37.506 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS BETTER THAN THE

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:39.141 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ALREADY EXISTING AND

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.709 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE MANY

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.277 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ALREADY

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:43.279 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:44.347 region:rollup2
ONLINE LEARNING.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:46.182 region:rollup2
WHO AND WHAT EVIDENCE DOES THE

01:14:44.347 --> 01:14:50.753 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAVE THAT THIS IS

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:53.289 region:rollup2
BETTER AND THAT THIS WILL WORK?

01:14:50.753 --> 01:14:55.658 region:rollup2
AUTHORED OFTEN AND SO SO WE KNOW

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:56.325 region:rollup2
THAT THESE AT TWO POINT FIVE

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.260 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:15:00.529 region:rollup2
ADULTS CURLY DON'T ACCESS.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.198 region:rollup2
I.

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.766 region:rollup2
COURSES SO.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.434 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THAT THAT'S

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:06.736 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT THE TRADITIONAL.

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:08.237 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE ISN'T.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:10.439 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR THAT

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:12.441 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT AND THE DEMAND

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:13.209 region:rollup2
FOR ONLINE IS GROWING WE KNOW

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:15.311 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:17.012 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. EYES AT STUDENTS IN

ONLINE PROGRAMS A PRIVATE EYE

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.017 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS SO WE KNOW THAT

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.885 region:rollup2
THERE IS A DEMAND WE KNOW THAT

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:25.488 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SHIFT.

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:26.422 region:rollup2
TOWARDS ONLINE TOWARDS FLEXIBLE

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:29.558 region:rollup2
I'M OPTIONS.

01:15:26.422 --> 01:15:30.659 region:rollup2
FOR ADULTS WHO CAN'T ATTEND

AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT.

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:38.234 region:rollup2
IDEAS OPPORTUNITIES FOR.

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:41.037 region:rollup2
AT THIS POPULATION TO ADVANCE

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.771 region:rollup2
IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND TO

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.773 region:rollup2
PROMOTE WHAT'S.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:46.175 region:rollup2
ADDS THROUGH.

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:48.611 region:rollup2
ISSUE CERTIFICATES THAT ARE

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:49.678 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED BY THE THE EMPLOYERS

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:51.747 region:rollup2
WE REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S AN

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:52.815 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:55.084 region:rollup2
TO HELP.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:57.420 region:rollup2
THIS POPULATION ADVANCE IN

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:59.422 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SUCCESS AN ONLINE WE

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.356 region:rollup2
ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN I'M

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:02.892 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS AND.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:04.493 region:rollup2
COURSE COMPLETIONS AN ONLINE.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:07.163 region:rollup2
THE COMEDIC COLLEGE.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:08.898 region:rollup2
AT A DATA SHOWS THAT THAT GAP

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FACE TO FACE AN ONLINE

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:12.468 region:rollup2
IS CLOSING IN WHO WE ALSO KNOW

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:15.971 region:rollup2
THAT. THERE ARE HAVE BEEN A LOT

01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:16.772 region:rollup2
OF INNOVATIONS IN AN ONLINE AND

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.306 region:rollup2
WITH PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:20.276 region:rollup2
BECOMING EASIER.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:22.411 region:rollup2
TO TO IDENTIFY THE SKILLS GAPS

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:25.181 region:rollup2
AND ADDRESS THOSE EARLY ON AND

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:27.016 region:rollup2
THEN I'M ONLINE SETTING SO SO WE

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:28.551 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION TO

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.819 region:rollup2
REACH A POPULATION THAT.

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:30.653 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY JUST AS AN ACCENT

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:36.759 region:rollup2
THINGAND.

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:38.427 region:rollup2
AT PROVIDING A FLEXIBLE OPTION.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:40.496 region:rollup2
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY I WOULD

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:42.865 region:rollup2
ALSO ADD THAT I THINK WE KNOW

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:43.566 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S RESEARCH OUT THERE.

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:44.600 region:rollup2
THAT INDICATES THAT ADULT

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:46.969 region:rollup2
LEARNERS.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.437 region:rollup2
PERFORM BEST IN A SELF DIRECTED

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.904 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT'S ALL A

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.706 region:rollup2
LONG STANDING RESEARCH

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:52.441 region:rollup2
PATTERNED.

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.709 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ARIZONA

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.744 region:rollup2
STATE UNIVERSITY.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:57.780 region:rollup2
HAS ROUGHLY ELEVEN THOUSAND

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:59.515 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS IN THERE UP FACE TO

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.516 region:rollup2
FACE CLASSROOM WE KNOW THAT

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:02.284 region:rollup2
THEIR ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:04.920 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS TAKING ONLINE

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:06.856 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THROUGH ASU ONLINE. AND

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.991 region:rollup2
IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:10.860 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS ARE ROUGHLY.

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:12.595 region:rollup2
COMPLETING THE PROGRAMS AND

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.630 region:rollup2
HAVING SUCCESS RATES THAT ARE

01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:16.632 region:rollup2
ALMOST IDENTICAL BETWEEN THE TWO

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.299 region:rollup2
FORMATS.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.068 region:rollup2
I I WOULD SAY.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:21.904 region:rollup2
.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:23.072 region:rollup2
THAT I DO NOT SEE NOR DO I HEAR

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:26.075 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OF EVIDENCE TO

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:28.043 region:rollup2
CONVINCE ME THAT THIS IS.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:29.044 region:rollup2
REALLY A PROGRAM THAT WILL WORK

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.779 region:rollup2
AND IN THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:32.348 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO WORK.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:34.550 region:rollup2
OUR I I HAVEN'T SEEN HER OR

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:35.251 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT EVIDENCE

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:35.584 region:rollup2
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD IT HERE

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:37.286 region:rollup2
TODAY EITHER.

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:37.820 region:rollup2
.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:40.523 region:rollup2
TO ME IT'S A A BIG PROGRAM

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.290 region:rollup2
SHIFT.

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:43.425 region:rollup2
IN THE WEIGH.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:44.994 region:rollup2
AND IT AND IT HAS ALL SORTS OF

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:46.362 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:47.897 region:rollup2
CONFLICT OF INTEREST THE

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:49.198 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:50.733 region:rollup2
TO SET THIS UP IN THE

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:53.402 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:55.504 region:rollup2
HI AS A INDEPENDENT COLLEGE

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:56.505 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD GOVERN THAT IS UNCLEAR

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.973 region:rollup2
TO ME TO THEIR ISSUES OF

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.341 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE.

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:01.043 region:rollup2
AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.878 region:rollup2
ARISES.

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:04.380 region:rollup2
APART FROM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.215 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.184 region:rollup2
THE A INVESTORS SURE OF A

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:10.252 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS A

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:13.122 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY A BIG SOUND.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:14.890 region:rollup2
I I SEE IT IS A SHIFT. IN POLICY

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:16.458 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY AND I'M

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:19.195 region:rollup2
ASKING OUR LEADERSHIP.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:21.163 region:rollup2
TO BRING THIS PROPOSAL WHERE CAN

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.898 region:rollup2
BE BETTER DISCUSS AND THAT WOULD

01:18:21.163 --> 01:18:24.600 region:rollup2
BE IN THAT COMMITTEE OF HIGHER

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:26.402 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. I'M ASKING OUR

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.337 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT TO BRING

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:30.072 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE TO HIGHER EDUCATION

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:31.407 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. AYE I THINK IT'S.

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:33.208 region:rollup2
WORTH.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:35.110 region:rollup2
FLUSHING OUT.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:38.380 region:rollup2
AND ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT I

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:39.648 region:rollup2
THINK THAT LA SO OFFICE RAZORS.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.183 region:rollup2
AND QUESTIONS THAT I KNOW A LOT

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:42.351 region:rollup2
OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SO I I

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:43.519 region:rollup2
WILL.

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:45.287 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ASK.

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:46.322 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP TO DO THAT TO BRING

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:48.757 region:rollup2
THIS FORWARD TO.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:50.292 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS IT MORE IN

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:51.594 region:rollup2
THE STOCK COMMITTEE ON HIGHER

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:54.063 region:rollup2
EDUCATION?

01:18:51.594 --> 01:18:54.296 region:rollup2
THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA IS ALSO

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.166 region:rollup2
A SHIFT.

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:59.068 region:rollup2
.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:19:00.636 region:rollup2
BUT IF A YOU KNOW YOU FEEL

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:02.271 region:rollup2
STRONGLY THAT THAT THAT'S GOING

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:04.340 region:rollup2
TO WORK ALRIGHT WE'LL GIVE IT A

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:06.375 region:rollup2
TRY. BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THE

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:09.011 region:rollup2
ONLINE COLLEGE DESERVES A FAIR

01:19:06.375 --> 01:19:11.380 region:rollup2
HEARING. OF MERCANTE TALKED

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:13.315 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.916 region:rollup2
WELL THANK YOU MISTER AYE MEDINA

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:14.783 region:rollup2
AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE YOU

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:17.486 region:rollup2
GOT HERE.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:18.687 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.822 region:rollup2
HOT TOPICS IN THE BUDGET

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:21.390 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FEW TOPICS

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:23.125 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET AND ALL SORTS OF

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.526 region:rollup2
MINIMAL BUDGET FOR HIGHER ED. I

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:26.528 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE OVERVIEW WE'RE GOING

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:28.430 region:rollup2
TO DIG INTO IT DEEP IN THE

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:29.865 region:rollup2
POLICY I. THINK IN THE POLICY IN

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.300 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET IMPLICATIONS IN THE

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:33.269 region:rollup2
HEARING IN A FEW.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:35.437 region:rollup2
IN A FEW WEEKS BUT THERE IS

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:36.639 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT I WILL REMIND US THAT

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:39.408 region:rollup2
TOUGH YEARS AGO WHEN THE

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:41.944 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR PROPOSED. AT LCF HALF.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:43.779 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT WAS YOUR YOUR

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.913 region:rollup2
ALL YOUR FIRST YEAR HERE. IT WAS

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.714 region:rollup2
A TWO YEAR PROCESS DURING THE

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:47.783 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR I THINK THE

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:49.318 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE ARE REJECTED THE

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.819 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL DIRECTOR THE GOVERNOR

TO INTRODUCE A BILL IN POLICY

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:53.422 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THE GOVERNOR DID NOT

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:55.424 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:56.859 region:rollup2
IT IS ACTUALLY I TOOK A TIME OUT

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.459 region:rollup2
FOR THE YEAR AND CAME BACK THE

01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:59.028 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR IN THE BUDGET AGAIN

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.729 region:rollup2
SO.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:02.931 region:rollup2
I WEEK WE HAVE ENTERTAINED THESE

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:04.767 region:rollup2
ISSUES ON BIG IT ON BIG POLICY

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.034 region:rollup2
MATTERS SO SOMETHING WE WILL.

01:20:04.767 --> 01:20:07.503 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:09.305 region:rollup2
THAT PUT INTO CONSIDERATION AS

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:10.639 region:rollup2
WE MOVE FORWARD SO. I THINK YOU

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:12.107 region:rollup2
FOR THAT I OR WE ARE GOING TO

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.575 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM THE SEGMENTS IN A FEW

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:15.277 region:rollup2
SECONDS AS WELL BY THE I I

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:16.679 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUST ASK ON THE

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:19.715 region:rollup2
OVERALL.

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:21.383 region:rollup2
A FUNDING FOR THE UC AND CSU AND

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:23.852 region:rollup2
GRANTED IT WAS A LIGHT BUDGET

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:25.154 region:rollup2
THIS I'M THIS IS JANUARY TEN.

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:27.122 region:rollup2
A TON OF MONEY WENT TO.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.791 region:rollup2
THE RESERVE RAINY DAY FUND

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:30.225 region:rollup2
WHICH IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA

01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:31.193 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR US TO TO SET UP FOR.

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:32.661 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:34.630 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.798 region:rollup2
THEM THE MAJORITY MONEY WENT TO

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:37.232 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH WE ARE

01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:39.068 region:rollup2
HEARING IN COMMITTEE COLLEGES

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:39.868 region:rollup2
AND K. TWELVE SO WAS A LOT

GENERAL FUND MONEY AND THE FIRST

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:43.439 region:rollup2
PLACE BUT. I'M HAD THERE BEEN

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:44.373 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.542 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:48.077 region:rollup2
UCC ISSUE HIGHER ED HEALTH

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:49.611 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES AS WELL BY IS WHEN

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:50.112 region:rollup2
I GO TO THE OVERALL PREMISE OF

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:52.114 region:rollup2
THE OF THE THREE PERCENT

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:53.382 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:55.284 region:rollup2
IT KIND OF.

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:56.618 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>IT'S IT'S BOTH WAYS HERE</c></u>

01:20:55.284 --> 01:20:58.354 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:59.988 region:rollup2
AS WE DON'T WANT TO INCREASE

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:01.824 region:rollup2
STUDENT FEES NONE OF US WANT

01:20:59.988 --> 01:21:02.391 region:rollup2
THAT TO STUDENTS DON'T WANT THAT

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:03.225 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:04.326 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:06.361 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT THAT.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:08.530 region:rollup2
BUT THE SAME TIME THERE IS THIS.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.565 region:rollup2
BELIEF THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.600 region:rollup2
GOVERN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:12.701 region:rollup2
ARE SAYING HEY. THE PROMISES

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.802 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT AND WE'RE GOING

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.437 region:rollup2
HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS THE

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:16.839 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS ARE SAYING WELL. WITH

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:19.308 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT WAS OUT OF MONEY

01:21:16.839 --> 01:21:20.743 region:rollup2
TO. PAY THE BILLS THE BASICS PAY

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:23.712 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:25.481 region:rollup2
GOT COMPENSATION YOU KNOW THE.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.548 region:rollup2
RIGHTFULLY EARNED COMPENSATION

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:28.984 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:30.786 region:rollup2
NO MONEY TO PAY FOR STUDENTS.

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:32.588 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH WHICH IS WHAT

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:33.055 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE WE

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:34.256 region:rollup2
AND MARK GRADUATES IN

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.724 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:37.760 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.762 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.063 region:rollup2
YOU SAYING NO ONE STUDENT FEE

01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:44.566 region:rollup2
INCREASES NO ADDITIONAL.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:45.868 region:rollup2
I MONEY ABOUT THREE PERCENT.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE THERE

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:49.004 region:rollup2
ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT I

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.671 region:rollup2
TIGHTLY I THINK FIRST AT THREE

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.740 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:53.142 region:rollup2
THAT IS ACTUALLY LARGER THAN

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.743 region:rollup2
THE IMPLICIT PRICE THE PREDATOR

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:56.145 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE TODAY WHICH IS TWO

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.613 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE ONE PERCENT.

01:21:56.145 --> 01:22:00.249 region:rollup2
SO I I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S A

01:21:57.613 --> 01:22:03.085 region:rollup2
HEALTHY INVESTMENT WITHIN THE.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:04.586 region:rollup2
THE CSU ON THE UC.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:06.588 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SECOND COMPONENT

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:08.791 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW VOCALIZED.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:10.793 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:12.327 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING BOTH SEGMENTS TO

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:14.530 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THEIR COST STRUCTURES.

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:16.799 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT WAYS TO REDUCE THEIR

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:18.734 region:rollup2
COSTS INTERNALLY SO THAT WITH

01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:20.436 region:rollup2
THIS THREE PERCENT AUGMENTATION

01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:23.038 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THEIR THE RESOURCES.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:24.940 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR ALL

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:27.042 region:rollup2
OF THEIR COSTS WITHOUT REQUIRING

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.811 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TUITION INCREASES.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:30.579 region:rollup2
SO I AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:31.880 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE AS STUDENTS ARE

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:33.615 region:rollup2
GRADUATING IN A MORE TIMELY

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.983 region:rollup2
MANNER FROM THE CSU THROUGH THE

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:37.386 region:rollup2
GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:38.887 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE. THAT IN THEORY IS

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:40.656 region:rollup2
OPENING UP CAPACITY TO EITHER

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:42.758 region:rollup2
SERVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS OR

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:46.862 region:rollup2
CHIU UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES TO

01:22:42.758 --> 01:22:48.030 region:rollup2
MEET. THE GOALS OF THE CSU.

01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:49.264 region:rollup2
YEAH I I MEAN WERE IN FULL

01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.766 region:rollup2
ACCORD WITH THAT ESPECIALLY THE

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.300 region:rollup2
GRADUATES INITIATIVES WE'RE

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:53.435 region:rollup2
GONNA BE TALKING. LATER ON

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.937 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:56.738 region:rollup2
I FURTHER INCENTIVIZING STUDENTS

01:22:54.937 --> 01:22:58.574 region:rollup2
WHO GET A CAL GRANT TO GO FULL

01:22:56.738 --> 01:23:00.075 region:rollup2
TIME TRUTHFUL TIME THAT THE BELL

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:03.312 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF FULL TIME.

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:04.780 region:rollup2
I WANT TO ASK YOU LA ELF YOU

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.648 region:rollup2
COULD CARP RESPOND TO THAT AND.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.917 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT DESIRES THAT DID

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:10.185 region:rollup2
NOT INCREASE FEES BUT THEN.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:12.087 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.455 region:rollup2
A PLUGGING IN THREE PERCENT BY

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.790 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT IS GREATER THAN A

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:16.291 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL CALL IS TODAY

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:17.493 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:20.062 region:rollup2
PERCENT WHICH AS YOU KNOW AS YOU

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:21.497 region:rollup2
NOTED THERE ARE. FIXED COSTS IN

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:23.465 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION HEALTH

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:25.567 region:rollup2
COSTS.

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:26.134 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT COSTS WHAT BUT HAPPY

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.103 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THESE

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:29.838 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:31.406 region:rollup2
YEAH AND BECAUSE THAT THEIR

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:33.976 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY HAVING THE STATE

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:35.344 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BEAR THAT.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:37.212 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION FOR THE ENTIRE

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.714 region:rollup2
COURT BUDGET ADEQUATE STE MORE

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:41.016 region:rollup2
LIKE ONE AND A HALF SO DEPENDING

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:42.484 region:rollup2
ON YOUR INFLATION INDICATOR IS.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.553 region:rollup2
ON THE CORNER FUND BUDGET

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:46.221 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ISN'T EQUATING TO

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:47.589 region:rollup2
INFLATION HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.657 region:rollup2
NEVER ENCOURAGED YOU TO JUST

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:50.292 region:rollup2
GIVE THEM AN INFLATION

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.460 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT AND WALK AWAY. WE'VE

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:52.895 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:54.263 region:rollup2
WHAT INCREASES IF ANY DO YOU

01:23:52.895 --> 01:23:56.365 region:rollup2
WANT TO SUPPORT AT THE SEGMENTS

01:23:54.263 --> 01:23:57.466 region:rollup2
IS IT. FACULTY'S SALARIES ARE

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:58.500 region:rollup2
NOT COMPETITIVE AND YOU WANT TO

01:23:57.466 --> 01:23:59.902 region:rollup2
MAKE THEM MORE COMPETITIVE

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.803 region:rollup2
ANYONE INCREASE THEM THREE OR

01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:03.605 region:rollup2
FOUR OR FIVE PERCENT TO PERCENT

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:04.940 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU FIND REASONABLE.

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:06.074 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAVE AS

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.476 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH WHAT KIND OF

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:09.144 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN DOT SERVICE WOULD

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:11.079 region:rollup2
YOU LIKE TO SEE BECAUSE OF NEW

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:13.282 region:rollup2
CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST?

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:14.650 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:15.450 region:rollup2
IS ESTABLISHING YOUR PRIORITIES

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:16.585 region:rollup2
ARE WE TRYING TO DO ON THE

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:18.320 region:rollup2
REPORT IS WALK THROUGH THINGS

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:20.188 region:rollup2
LIKE COMPENSATION ENROLLMENT

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.857 region:rollup2
GROWTH THESE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:23.325 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC QUALITY OF

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:24.326 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE STATEMENTS TO JUST

01:24:23.325 --> 01:24:25.594 region:rollup2
TRY TO GIVE YOU A FRAMEWORK FOR

01:24:24.326 --> 01:24:26.194 region:rollup2
WHETHER THOSE. WOULD BE THE

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:27.362 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS YOU WOULD WANT

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:29.364 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:31.099 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO FEE INCREASES

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:32.434 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS THIS.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.468 region:rollup2
I'D.

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:35.170 region:rollup2
IDEA IS SUMMIT IS GOING TO BE

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:36.338 region:rollup2
BEARING THE COST INCREASES GOING

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.439 region:rollup2
TO BE THE GENERAL TAXPAYER IS

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:38.807 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE STUDENT WHETHER

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:40.742 region:rollup2
IT'S THREE PERCENT OR ONE AND A

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:42.811 region:rollup2
HALF PERCENT. THERE'S A COST TO

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:43.912 region:rollup2
BEAR SO WE'D JUST CONTINUALLY

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.546 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO THINK

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.315 region:rollup2
ABOUT LET'S MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:47.516 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT YOU WANT

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:48.984 region:rollup2
TO DO WHETHER THE STATE'S GOING

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:50.752 region:rollup2
TO BEAR THE FULL COST OR WHETHER

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:53.055 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE SHARED.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:55.490 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS. ECONOMIC EXPANSION

01:24:53.055 --> 01:24:57.492 region:rollup2
AND WAGES STILL ARE GOING ON BY

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:58.093 region:rollup2
AND LARGE WHETHER THIS IS A TIME

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.661 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU THINK IT WOULD BE

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.363 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO ASK FAMILIES TO

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:03.665 region:rollup2
PAY.

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:06.068 region:rollup2
SOME MODEST AMOUNT MORE IS AGAIN

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:08.270 region:rollup2
WITHIN YOUR BAILIWICK TO DECIDE.

01:25:06.068 --> 01:25:10.038 region:rollup2
.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:11.206 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD JUST BE.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.708 region:rollup2
CONTEXT FOR THE THINGS YOU MIGHT

01:25:11.206 --> 01:25:14.943 region:rollup2
CONSIDER I'M SORRY THIS IS A

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:16.845 region:rollup2
FINAL COMMENT AND I DIDN'T A

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.113 region:rollup2
VERY SYSTEMATICALLY MENTIONED

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:19.514 region:rollup2
THIS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.615 region:rollup2
TO BE DOING THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.250 region:rollup2

SUPPORT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.522 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.957 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND REJECTING WHAT THE

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:30.726 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAS PRESENTED TO YOU

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:32.861 region:rollup2

WE.

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:45.207 region:rollup2
DON'T TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW YOU

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2

THEM YOU'D HAVE MONEY TO DO YOUR

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:51.179 region:rollup2
OWN PRIORITIES.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:52.447 region:rollup2
WE DO OFFER SOME SUGGESTIONS AND

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:54.082 region:rollup2
THEN I'LL ASSESS WHAT YOU COULD

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:55.584 region:rollup2
DO MORE FOR FINANCIAL AID IF YOU

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:59.121 region:rollup2
ALL FULL TIME FINANCIALLY NEEDY

01:25:57.552 --> 01:26:00.522 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT

01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:02.391 region:rollup2
HAVE ARE NOT LIVING COSTS WITH

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:03.959 region:rollup2
THE GRANT. THAT WOULD COST MORE

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:05.427 region:rollup2
THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED TO

01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:07.062 region:rollup2
YOU. I'M IF YOU WANTED TO

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:08.897 region:rollup2
PROVIDE APPRENTICESHIPS MORE

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:10.432 region:rollup2
FUNDING ON ONGOING BASIS THAT

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:11.500 region:rollup2
WOULD COST MORE SO THIS IS ALL

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:12.634 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.103 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF BUDGET

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:15.704 region:rollup2
YOU ONE OBVIOUSLY AS THE WEEKS

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.873 region:rollup2
GONE ARE HAPPY TO TRY TO HELP

01:26:15.704 --> 01:26:20.008 region:rollup2
YOU DID.

01:26:17.873 --> 01:26:22.778 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA.

THANK YOU AND SO I YOU KNOW AS

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:25.180 region:rollup2
THEY CAME IN AND IT WAS HEARING

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.448 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.484 region:rollup2
AND SO I WANTED TO COME AND

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:31.253 region:rollup2
JUST OVERALL AND I NEED TO THE

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:33.121 region:rollup2
ASPECTS THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING

01:26:31.253 --> 01:26:34.823 region:rollup2
AND THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:36.691 region:rollup2
I THINK I WOULD ECHO. I YOU KNOW

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:38.193 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES AT COMMENTS IN

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.995 region:rollup2
TERMS OF LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.963 region:rollup2
HAVING SERVED ON TO KEEP YOUR

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:44.166 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARD AND I ALSO KNOW

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:45.567 region:rollup2
THAT ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:47.502 region:rollup2
IS A WHOLE OTHER THING NO MATTER

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:49.271 region:rollup2
WHAT THE TREND IS DOING.

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:50.605 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY FOR EXACTLY

01:26:49.271 --> 01:26:52.374 region:rollup2
THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:54.576 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO I'M

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:56.912 region:rollup2
REACH AND A TIMER OVER THE LAST

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:57.546 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE STILL TALKED

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:58.313 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME COMMUNITIES NOT EVEN

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:00.982 region:rollup2
HAVING.

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:03.118 region:rollup2
FULL NEEDED ACCESS TO INTERNET.

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:04.419 region:rollup2
ITS YOU KNOW I I THINK OF HOW

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:05.954 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE OF THE TWO POINT

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:08.223 region:rollup2
FIVE ARE IN THOSE EXACT SAME

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:10.459 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE THE

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.793 region:rollup2
ISSUES. AND THAT THEY STILL

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:13.895 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE FULL ACCESS

01:27:11.793 --> 01:27:15.230 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:16.965 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:18.567 region:rollup2
LOT OF ELEMENTS AND THAT I TO

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:20.569 region:rollup2
HIM LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE THAT

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.770 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENT AT

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:23.004 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR TIME.

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.506 region:rollup2
.

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:25.740 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED CREATIVITY NAY

01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:27.242 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S REASONS TO BE

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:29.177 region:rollup2
CREATIVE AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:31.313 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO REACH A HARD TO

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:33.415 region:rollup2
REACH POPULATION. AND BUT I ALSO

01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:34.816 region:rollup2
THINK THAT AND THERE ARE SOME

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.418 region:rollup2
TOOLS IN PLACE AND SEVEN MET

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:38.019 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IF I LOOKED AT THE

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:39.421 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I LOOK AT

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:41.323 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING HAS BEEN MULTIPLE

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:43.058 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS MADE TO DIFFERENT

01:27:41.323 --> 01:27:45.160 region:rollup2
TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND NOT ALL

01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:46.261 region:rollup2
ONLINE. THAT REACH THAT YOU KNOW

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.163 region:rollup2
ARE TARGETED TO REACH SOME OF

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:50.065 region:rollup2
OUR HARD TO REACH STUDENTS AND

01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:52.501 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK OF YOU KNOW. HOW

01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:55.270 region:rollup2
DO WE WAY THAT OUT BUT I AM I DO

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:56.571 region:rollup2
I DO I THINK THAT? THAT EVIDENCE

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.273 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR AT

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:59.574 region:rollup2
LEAST ME AND TO BETTER

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.510 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS THE RIGHT

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:03.879 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AT THIS PARTICULAR

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:04.446 region:rollup2
MOMENT IN TIME. ON IF IT'S

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:07.182 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:28:04.446 --> 01:28:08.583 region:rollup2
CONSIDER YOU KNOW IN OTHER FORMS

01:28:07.182 --> 01:28:09.684 region:rollup2
OF LOOKING AT WHAT'S ALREADY IN

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:12.287 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:14.055 region:rollup2
ANNIE DOING FURTHER EXPANSION

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:17.292 region:rollup2
INVESTING THERE OR REALLY

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:18.827 region:rollup2
STARTING A WHOLE NEW GRANDMA AND

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:20.162 region:rollup2
BRAND.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:23.198 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT.

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:24.766 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE UC FUNDING.

01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:26.802 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I WANT TO BE SURE

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:28.236 region:rollup2
THAT THE STUDENT VOICES IS AND

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:29.437 region:rollup2
NARRATIVE IS NOT LOST IN THIS

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.806 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK ABOUT THE FACT

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:32.407 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU KNOW.

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:33.975 region:rollup2
EVEN THERE IS MENTION ABOUT YOU

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:34.576 region:rollup2
KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S. THREE

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.244 region:rollup2
PERCENT IS MORE THAN TWO POINT

01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:37.712 region:rollup2
FIVE.

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:39.214 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT THE FOUR PERCENT.

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:40.382 region:rollup2
AND AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT

01:28:39.214 --> 01:28:42.551 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAS.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:45.020 region:rollup2
BECOME VERY REAL IN THE LIFE OF

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:46.988 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AYE AND DADDY IS THAT

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:49.224 region:rollup2
THAT THE LANDSCAPE AND HIGHER IT

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:50.892 region:rollup2
IS CHANGING. AND AT A TIME WHERE

01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:52.260 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:54.396 region:rollup2
IMPACTS.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.598 region:rollup2
AND CHANGES WE MAY SEE FROM THE

01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:58.700 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH A

01:28:56.598 --> 01:29:01.036 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS TITLE

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.704 region:rollup2
NINE. THE PELL GRANT FIFTEEN

01:29:01.036 --> 01:29:05.073 region:rollup2
UNITS VERSUS TWELVE UNITS.

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:07.909 region:rollup2
I THINK OF THE FACT THAT OUR

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:10.545 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT.

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:12.647 region:rollup2
JUST THINKING ABOUT WHETHER

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:15.383 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE YEAR OF TUITION. AND

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:17.786 region:rollup2
INCREASE AND MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:20.855 region:rollup2
IMPACT CAN BE TAKE IN THE COMING

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:22.858 region:rollup2
YEAR AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:24.326 region:rollup2
JUST HOW WE INCORPORATE THAT IT

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:26.161 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S THINKING IN

01:29:24.326 --> 01:29:27.996 region:rollup2
TERMS OF LIKE THERE MAY ACTUALLY

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:30.098 region:rollup2
BE OTHER CUTS AND IF WE'RE

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:31.833 region:rollup2
INCREASING TUITION. AND A TIME

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:34.269 region:rollup2
WHERE WE MAY BE TELLING STUDENTS

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:35.604 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU KNOW TWELVE HAS BEEN

01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:36.938 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED FOR TWELVE UNITS HAS

01:29:35.604 --> 01:29:38.640 region:rollup2
BEEN CONSIDER FULL TIME FOR

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:40.642 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL AID BUT WE

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.010 region:rollup2
MAKE UP THAT ON YOU TO FIFTEEN

01:29:40.642 --> 01:29:43.612 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA MEAN THAT THEY ARE

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:45.447 region:rollup2
GOING TO PAY MORE. IN TUITION

01:29:43.612 --> 01:29:47.549 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WORK MORE HOURS I MEAN

01:29:45.447 --> 01:29:48.149 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO WORK AS MANY

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.551 region:rollup2
HOURS BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE TO

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.151 region:rollup2
TAKE.

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:52.454 region:rollup2
THE THREE UNIT DIFFERENCE IN

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:53.555 region:rollup2
QUARTER. YOU KNOW I IN SCHOOLS

01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:55.156 region:rollup2
THAT RUN ON A QUARTER SYSTEM AS

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.458 region:rollup2
A WHOLE OTHER CLASS.

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:58.293 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DOES THAT INCORPORATE

01:29:56.458 --> 01:30:01.596 region:rollup2
INTO ALL OF THIS AND HOW DO WE

01:29:58.293 --> 01:30:03.598 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE? AND THAT WE AT LEAST

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:04.499 region:rollup2
CONSIDER A STOP GAP IN A YEAR

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:07.369 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY MAY BE OTHER FEDERAL

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:08.603 region:rollup2
IMPACTS.

01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:10.038 region:rollup2
SO YOU THINK IT'S DIFFICULT

01:30:08.603 --> 01:30:11.473 region:rollup2
FRONT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:13.208 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AT BEST TO PROTECT.

01:30:11.473 --> 01:30:15.210 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:16.945 region:rollup2
WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH AT ANY

01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:18.513 region:rollup2
GIVEN MOMENT AND I THINK?

01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:19.814 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT WE UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:21.549 region:rollup2
CONCERN CERTAINLY.

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:23.351 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:25.086 region:rollup2
SAY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:27.188 region:rollup2
WILL OR WON'T DO AT THIS POINT.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.789 region:rollup2
I'M SURE WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.890 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION BASED

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:31.226 region:rollup2
ON.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:32.327 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT

01:30:31.226 --> 01:30:33.762 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE

01:30:32.327 --> 01:30:35.063 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD WITH IT IT'S A

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.298 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT?

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:37.666 region:rollup2
POSITION BUT WE CERTAINLY

01:30:36.298 --> 01:30:40.535 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:43.338 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO MONITOR IT.

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:44.239 region:rollup2
WE MEAN TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:46.174 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:30:44.239 --> 01:30:49.177 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY MOVES FORWARD WITH

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:50.779 region:rollup2
AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. AS

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:52.213 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW THE DID IT THAT

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.915 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INFORMATION BECOMES

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:56.051 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR TO THE STATE. UP BUT

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:57.385 region:rollup2
UNTIL THAT POINT IN TIME I THINK

01:30:56.051 --> 01:31:00.121 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE

01:30:57.385 --> 01:31:02.857 region:rollup2
PREMATURE TO ASSUME WHAT THE

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:04.225 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL OR WILL.

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.794 region:rollup2
WELL AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:10.432 region:rollup2
THESE ARE VERY SPECIFIC ON ITEMS

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:12.334 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:13.001 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION

01:31:12.334 --> 01:31:17.072 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE

01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:19.841 region:rollup2
GOING. AND I ALSO WANT TO AND.

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:21.710 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KNOWING OUR PROCESS

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:23.378 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT WE

01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:25.647 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MEANS TO CORRECT THAT

01:31:23.378 --> 01:31:27.949 region:rollup2
IF NEED BE AND SO I WANT TO BE

01:31:25.647 --> 01:31:28.917 region:rollup2
SURE THAT TO AS. THIS BUT YOU

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:31.753 region:rollup2
KNOW BUDGET.

01:31:28.917 --> 01:31:34.356 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD AYE THAT IF THERE

01:31:31.753 --> 01:31:35.724 region:rollup2
IS THE HOW A TRIGGER WHAT IS

01:31:34.356 --> 01:31:37.892 region:rollup2
THAT TRIGGER GONNA LOOK LIKE TO

01:31:35.724 --> 01:31:39.994 region:rollup2
RE CORRECT ANYTHING THAT MAY

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.829 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BECAUSE IN THE LIFE. OF A

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:43.998 region:rollup2
STUDENT.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:46.134 region:rollup2
TO WAIT AN ENTIRE ACADEMIC YEAR.

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:47.936 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE VERY GOAL OF

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:49.871 region:rollup2
HELPING STUDENTS REACH TIME TO

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:50.839 region:rollup2
DEGREE MAY BE IMPACTED AND BY

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:52.507 region:rollup2
SAYING HEY THIS WAS OF THE

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:54.275 region:rollup2
BUDGET WE REALLY CAN'T DEAL WITH

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:56.511 region:rollup2
THIS UNTIL ANOTHER YEAR WHEN

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:57.278 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE CHANGES. AND CAN

01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:00.315 region:rollup2
BE REALLY.

01:31:57.278 --> 01:32:02.584 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DETRIMENTAL TO THE THE

01:32:00.315 --> 01:32:04.786 region:rollup2
LIFE OF A STUDENT AND NOT JUST

01:32:02.584 --> 01:32:07.055 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GETTING INTO IT. A

01:32:04.786 --> 01:32:07.956 region:rollup2
YOU SEE BUT GRADUATING FROM A

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:11.025 region:rollup2
YOU SEE AND ALSO BEING

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:12.861 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL ON THIS IT YES SO SO.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:14.496 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME THOUGHT

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:16.664 region:rollup2
INTO WHAT WOULD TRIGGER.

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:19.467 region:rollup2
A A REMEDY.

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:21.369 region:rollup2
FOR STUDENTS IF SOME OF THIS

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:22.637 region:rollup2
WERE TO HAPPEN AND IN LIGHT OF

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:24.906 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN TWO

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:26.508 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE TO THREE PERCENT TO

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.509 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT.

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:29.010 region:rollup2
OKAY WITH THAT WE WANT TO

01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:31.046 region:rollup2
UPGRADE OF THIS TO MEDINA YET

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.714 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:34.215 region:rollup2
AND I FORGET. HIS NAME BUT IT

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:36.217 region:rollup2
WAS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE OF THE

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.851 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.318 region:rollup2
HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE DEATH

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:39.087 region:rollup2
PENALTY.

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:40.388 region:rollup2
AND HE SAID.

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:42.190 region:rollup2
BUT TALKING ABOUT THE DEATH

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.826 region:rollup2
PENALTY DID HE WOULD NO LONGER.

01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:47.228 region:rollup2
I CONTEMPLATE DEALING AROUND THE

01:32:44.826 --> 01:32:48.630 region:rollup2
EDGES OF THE DEATH PENALTY HE

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.865 region:rollup2
THREW IT OUT THE CITY'S NO LUCK

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:53.802 region:rollup2
HE'S TIRED OF DEALING WITH IT.

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:56.871 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR.

01:32:53.802 --> 01:32:58.907 region:rollup2
I FEEL LIKE THAT JUDGE THAT YEAR

01:32:56.871 --> 01:33:01.042 region:rollup2
AFTER YEAR WE SIT HERE.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:03.311 region:rollup2
IN SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:03.878 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:07.015 region:rollup2

01:33:07.015 --> 01:33:10.351 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:12.954 region:rollup2
WHY WE CAN'T DO BETTER FOR

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:14.989 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION?

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:17.325 region:rollup2
I HAVE.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:18.960 region:rollup2
DONE LISTENING TO WHY WE CAN'T

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:21.162 region:rollup2
DO BETTER.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.064 region:rollup2
I AM DONE LISTENING IT IS UNFAIR

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:24.599 region:rollup2
TO THE STUDENTS WHO SIT HERE

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:27.202 region:rollup2
OVER GOING TO HEAR FROM.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:29.671 region:rollup2
LATER IN PUBLIC TESTIMONY IT IS

01:33:27.202 --> 01:33:31.239 region:rollup2
UNFAIR TO THE THOUSANDS OF

01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:32.640 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT HERE IN

01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:34.909 region:rollup2

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.511 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES AND THEY DON'T GET TO

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:37.479 region:rollup2
COME UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO.

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:39.147 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY'RE BUSY TAKING

01:33:37.479 --> 01:33:40.615 region:rollup2
CLASSES THEY'RE BUILT THEIR BUSY

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:42.217 region:rollup2
WITH TWO JOBS AND WE DON'T HEAR

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:43.084 region:rollup2
FROM THEM.

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:45.487 region:rollup2
BUT I HOPE WE HEAR FROM OF THIS

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:47.655 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:33:45.487 --> 01:33:48.423 region:rollup2
SO I'M DONE LISTENING TO WHY WE

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:50.124 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO BETTER.

01:33:48.423 --> 01:33:51.960 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:54.095 region:rollup2
LET ME ASK A QUESTION.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.998 region:rollup2
DID WE OR DID WE NOT HAVE AN

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:58.199 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WITH WITH UC THAT WE

01:33:56.998 --> 01:34:00.535 region:rollup2

NOT RAISE.

01:34:00.535 --> 01:34:05.540 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULDN'T SEE TUITION

01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:08.343 region:rollup2
RAISES AND THAT WE WOULD GIVE UC

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:09.978 region:rollup2

WOULDN'T HAVE TO YOU SEE WE

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:16.284 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HAVE TO SEE. A TUITION

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:18.987 region:rollup2
RAISES WASN'T THERE. WAS THAT

01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:19.554 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT IN PLACE OR NOT.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:28.696 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND YOU

01:34:19.554 --> 01:34:29.197 region:rollup2

I THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN. THE

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:37.605 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR AND THE UC PRESIDENT.

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:38.706 region:rollup2
PREDICATED THAT IN THE LAST YEAR

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.508 region:rollup2
AND THIS YEAR THAT THE

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:42.477 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY COULD.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:43.578 region:rollup2
INCREASED TUITION.

01:34:42.477 --> 01:34:45.380 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WITH INFLATION.

01:34:43.578 --> 01:34:47.715 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.084 region:rollup2
I LAST YEAR'S TUITION INCREASE

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:50.552 region:rollup2
OF BOTH THE UC. AND THE CSU WAS

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:52.687 region:rollup2
GREATER THAN PREDICTED

01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:54.956 region:rollup2
INFLATION.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:56.124 region:rollup2
SO THE WHILE THERE WEREN'T

01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:58.026 region:rollup2
WHAT'S AGREEMENT.

01:34:56.124 --> 01:34:59.861 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:01.362 region:rollup2
THE UC AND CSU.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.629 region:rollup2
TWO ONE WAY FORWARD AND TO MAKE

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:03.464 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:03.932 region:rollup2
.

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:05.166 region:rollup2
THE COMPONENTS OF THAT

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:06.467 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:09.037 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE COST STRUCTURE.

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:10.805 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING.

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:12.640 region:rollup2
AND. TO WHICH INCREASES IN LINE

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:15.443 region:rollup2
WITH INFLATION AND OUT THE OTHER

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.644 region:rollup2
SPIRIT OF THAT AGREEMENT ARE.

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:17.979 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE THE BASE FOR

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:19.213 region:rollup2
POLICY SO TRIP TO TRY TO

01:35:17.979 --> 01:35:20.982 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:22.183 region:rollup2
IS THE TUITION ROSE HIGHER THAN

01:35:20.982 --> 01:35:23.217 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF INFLATION. THAT'S

01:35:22.183 --> 01:35:25.553 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:28.089 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEREFORE THE AGREEMENT

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
IS NO LONGER AN AGREEMENT. WELL

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:34.462 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT UP.

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:36.230 region:rollup2
BUT. THE THE INFLATION THEIR

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:38.766 region:rollup2
GRADE RATHER TUITION DAVID.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:39.234 region:rollup2
INCREASE FASTER THAN INFLATION

01:35:38.766 --> 01:35:41.636 region:rollup2
AND.

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:42.236 region:rollup2
A CORRESPONDING MOVES MADE ARE

01:35:41.636 --> 01:35:43.805 region:rollup2

SOMETHING.

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:53.348 region:rollup2

THESE WOULD BE STACKABLE ALSO OF

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:58.646 region:rollup2
A STUDENT DOES WANT TO PURSUE. A

01:36:57.979 --> 01:37:00.348 region:rollup2

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:02.116 region:rollup2
DECREED THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:03.618 region:rollup2
COLLEGE COVER FOR THAT AT THAT

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:05.753 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE COLLEGE BUT THEY DHEA

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:08.556 region:rollup2
IS THAT THESE CREDENTIALS. AND

01:37:07.722 --> 01:37:10.491 region:rollup2
THE CERTIFICATES WOULD BE

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:12.760 region:rollup2
CLOSELY LINKED TO A STUDENTS

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:15.329 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENTS SO FOR INSTANCE IT

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
COULD BE ASHORE I MEAN A PROJECT

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:18.466 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT QUARTERS THE LAST TWO

RECOGNIZED BY THE EMPLOYER AND

01:37:20.234 --> 01:37:25.106 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT EMPLOYEE

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:28.409 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE TO PROMOTE TOOL AS

01:37:25.106 --> 01:37:29.477 region:rollup2
SUPERB VYTORIN POSITION SO THESE

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:32.847 region:rollup2
ARE THE TYPES OF.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:36.684 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATES.

01:37:33.715 --> 01:37:39.253 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL.

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:40.621 region:rollup2
DEGREE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH

01:37:39.253 --> 01:37:44.525 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND TO

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:48.196 region:rollup2

THROUGH THE SPRING PROCESS.

01:37:49.397 --> 01:37:50.698 region:rollup2
THE USER IS THERE ANY

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:51.099 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATION WHO TEACH THESE

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.300 region:rollup2
CLASSES ARE THEY.

01:37:51.099 --> 01:37:52.967 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.568 region:rollup2
FACULTY ARE THEY IMMUNITY CITY

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:54.068 region:rollup2
IN RUSSIA WHERE THESE PEOPLE.

01:37:53.568 --> 01:37:54.702 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:55.236 region:rollup2
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THIS

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:55.837 region:rollup2
COLLEGE BUT RELY ON THE

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:56.804 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE THE FACULTY OF THE

01:37:55.837 --> 01:37:59.140 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES JUST LIKE ANY

01:37:56.804 --> 01:38:01.075 region:rollup2
COLLEGE DISTRICT AT THE COLLEGE

01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.076 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE AT FACULTY

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:03.177 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:06.047 region:rollup2
OF EXPERTISE.

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:07.882 region:rollup2
IN THE EXISTING COLLEGES TO HER

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:09.050 region:rollup2
WITH A WITH A DROP IN THE

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:10.051 region:rollup2
EXISTING PULL CALIFORNIA.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.320 region:rollup2
THREE COLLEGE FACULTY OR WERE

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:13.254 region:rollup2
THEY CREATE THEIR OWN UNIVERSITY

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.922 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE COULD BE FAR FAR

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:17.024 region:rollup2
AWAY.

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:18.025 region:rollup2
IN THEORY IF SO CAN YOU DO HAVE

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:20.528 region:rollup2
YOU CONTEMPLATED THAT IN YOUR

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:21.863 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

01:38:20.528 --> 01:38:23.564 region:rollup2
I THINK GENERALLY IT'S IT'S

01:38:21.863 --> 01:38:25.867 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED IN THAT YES THE

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:27.301 region:rollup2
COLLEGE COULD HIRE NEW FACULTY I

01:38:25.867 --> 01:38:29.504 region:rollup2
THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:31.305 region:rollup2
THOSE FACULTY. WOULD BE A

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:33.574 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED AS ANY OTHER FACULTY

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:35.176 region:rollup2
ARE WITHIN THE SYSTEM.

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:36.077 region:rollup2
TWO IS I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THE

01:38:35.176 --> 01:38:37.779 region:rollup2
ANSWER MY QUESTION THAT'S WHY

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:39.413 region:rollup2
I'M THEM AND I'M POKING AROUND

01:38:37.779 --> 01:38:40.982 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD THOSE FACULTY BE

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:42.617 region:rollup2
LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT THEY

01:38:40.982 --> 01:38:44.352 region:rollup2
BE FAR FAR AWAY. WOULD THEY BE

01:38:42.617 --> 01:38:45.853 region:rollup2
FROM EXISTING FACULTY IN

01:38:44.352 --> 01:38:47.021 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:48.156 region:rollup2
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT THAT

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:49.090 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER AT

01:38:48.156 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
SOME POINT IN THIS VENTURE

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:51.559 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DO YOU DO YOU KNOW THE

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:53.728 region:rollup2
ANSWER TODAY.

01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:55.663 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD SAY. IT IS LIKELY

01:38:53.728 --> 01:38:56.998 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD HAVE THIS COLLEGE

01:38:55.663 --> 01:39:00.067 region:rollup2
HIRING SOME EXISTING FACULTY

01:38:56.998 --> 01:39:01.502 region:rollup2
MEMBERS. OR A COULD BE A HIRING

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:02.703 region:rollup2
SOME ADJUNCT FACULTY THAT ARE

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:04.205 region:rollup2
WORKING PART TIME AT SOME OF

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:05.673 region:rollup2
THESE COLLEGES IT COULD BE

01:39:04.205 --> 01:39:07.975 region:rollup2
HIRING NEW FACULTY FOR THE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:09.310 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WITHIN. A YOU KNOW

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:10.278 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED FACULTY THAT ARE IN

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:12.647 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:39:10.278 --> 01:39:14.816 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS

01:39:12.647 --> 01:39:16.384 region:rollup2
FOR HIRING FACULTY BUT MY

01:39:14.816 --> 01:39:18.186 region:rollup2
STATEMENT REALLY IS THAT IF THEY

01:39:16.384 --> 01:39:20.321 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO MEET. THE MINIMUM

01:39:18.186 --> 01:39:22.156 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS TO BE A FACULTY

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:23.758 region:rollup2

COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:39:23.758 --> 01:39:26.828 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN ASK THIS QUESTION

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:29.597 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY HAVE TO BE LOCATED

01:39:26.828 --> 01:39:31.732 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY IN CALIFORNIA.

01:39:29.597 --> 01:39:33.034 region:rollup2
I THINK GENERALLY I DON'T THINK

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:34.602 region:rollup2
THAT THE TRAILER BILL SPEAKS TO

01:39:33.034 --> 01:39:36.237 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIFIC ASPECT BUT

01:39:34.602 --> 01:39:37.104 region:rollup2
GENERALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT THE

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:41.409 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TO BE HIRING FROM WITHIN

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:43.211 region:rollup2

01:45:21.582 --> 01:45:25.753 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW

01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:27.755 region:rollup2
HOUR TOTAL CORE FUNDS VERSUS

01:45:25.753 --> 01:45:29.123 region:rollup2

01:45:27.755 --> 01:45:30.157 region:rollup2
ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

01:45:29.123 --> 01:45:31.592 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:33.694 region:rollup2

LEASE.

01:45:56.584 --> 01:45:58.786 region:rollup2
BOND PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:45:57.918 --> 01:46:00.321 region:rollup2
INCREASING OVER THE LAST.

01:45:58.786 --> 01:46:02.590 region:rollup2
.

01:46:00.321 --> 01:46:05.359 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:06.994 region:rollup2
ON SLIDE SIX ARMED YOU WILL SEE

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:08.662 region:rollup2
HOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS STEADILY

01:46:06.994 --> 01:46:11.532 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:13.534 region:rollup2
OF OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO.

01:46:11.532 --> 01:46:15.736 region:rollup2

BOB SEVERAL DECADES.

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:19.540 region:rollup2
UGH THIS MEANS THAT STUDENTS WHO

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:22.543 region:rollup2
ARE ENROLLING TODAY ARE

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:25.179 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A LESS INDIVIDUALIZED

01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:26.947 region:rollup2
ATTENTION FROM FACULTY. AND ALSO

01:46:25.179 --> 01:46:29.016 region:rollup2
SITTING IN CLASSROOMS THAT ARE

01:46:26.947 --> 01:46:31.118 region:rollup2
MORE CROWDED. THAN PREVIOUS

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:33.354 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS.

01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:35.055 region:rollup2
WHILE WE WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE

01:46:33.354 --> 01:46:37.124 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:38.993 region:rollup2
REDUCING THAT RATIO BY ONLY ONE

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:40.628 region:rollup2
STUDENT PER FACULTY WITH TAKE

01:46:38.993 --> 01:46:42.229 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:46:40.628 --> 01:46:44.131 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. SO THEY

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:45.1000 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDS BEING PROVIDED

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.601 region:rollup2
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE NOT

01:46:45.1000 --> 01:46:49.403 region:rollup2
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE.

01:46:47.601 --> 01:46:52.339 region:rollup2
ON THE STUDENT FACULTY RATIO AT

01:46:49.403 --> 01:46:54.208 region:rollup2
THIS TIME.

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:57.244 region:rollup2
AND ON SLIDE SEVEN.

01:46:54.208 --> 01:46:58.712 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:59.980 region:rollup2
ASK IN ADDITION TO THE

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:02.249 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:04.251 region:rollup2
REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:06.487 region:rollup2
AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:08.656 region:rollup2
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS OFF THIS

01:47:06.487 --> 01:47:10.491 region:rollup2
IT IS IN LIEU OF THE TUITION AND

01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:11.725 region:rollup2
STUDENT FEE INCREASE SO THIS

01:47:10.491 --> 01:47:14.094 region:rollup2
WOULD KEEP TUITION AND STUDENT

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:16.230 region:rollup2
SERVICES BE. THE SAME AS IN

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:17.931 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR SO

01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:20.000 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS. DO NOT EXPERIENCE

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:23.804 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THEIR.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.273 region:rollup2
TUITION BILLS STOW WE DO TAKE

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:27.875 region:rollup2
GOOD CARE OF OUR STUDENTS IN

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:29.276 region:rollup2
TERMS OF FINANCIAL AID.

01:47:27.875 --> 01:47:31.645 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF OUR

01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:33.514 region:rollup2
STUDENTS DO NOT PAY TUITION FEES

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:34.949 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR FINANCIAL AID

01:47:33.514 --> 01:47:36.950 region:rollup2
PACKAGES CURRENTLY.

01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:39.586 region:rollup2
.

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:41.121 region:rollup2
AND ALSO PROVIDING THE SEVENTY

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:42.790 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE SYSTEM

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:44.391 region:rollup2
WOULD SAVE THE STATE SOME MONEY

01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:46.293 region:rollup2
ON THE CAL GRANTS BECAUSE.

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:48.329 region:rollup2
A.

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:50.998 region:rollup2
SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ON.

01:47:48.329 --> 01:47:53.834 region:rollup2
RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID.

01:47:50.998 --> 01:47:55.769 region:rollup2
CALTRANS COVER A PORTION OF THAT

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:56.837 region:rollup2
OF THOSE FEES FOR STUDENTS SO

01:47:55.769 --> 01:47:58.539 region:rollup2
IT'S APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

01:47:56.837 --> 01:48:00.441 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS OF SAVINGS ON

01:47:58.539 --> 01:48:01.709 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:48:00.441 --> 01:48:03.110 region:rollup2
WE'RE REQUESTING TWENTY FIVE

01:48:01.709 --> 01:48:04.745 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS

01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:05.946 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF RECENT GROWTH ON THE

01:48:04.745 --> 01:48:08.582 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:10.317 region:rollup2
WE'VE RECEIVED FUNDING FOR

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:12.186 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED NEW

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:13.854 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS IN

01:48:12.186 --> 01:48:16.857 region:rollup2
THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGETS.

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:18.225 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:20.661 region:rollup2
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WAS

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:22.529 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED AS AN ALL OR NOTHING.

01:48:20.661 --> 01:48:24.431 region:rollup2
UP FINE FUNDING FOR THOSE

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:27.001 region:rollup2

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:28.302 region:rollup2

THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS.

01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:34.475 region:rollup2
THIS CREATES A BURDEN ON THE

01:48:32.773 --> 01:48:36.410 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES BECAUSE CLASSROOMS ARE

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:38.445 region:rollup2
OVERCROWDED AND THE FUNDING TO

01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:39.613 region:rollup2
HIRE NEW INSTRUCTORS IS NOT

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:41.115 region:rollup2
THERE SO WE ARE REQUESTING AN

EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE RECESS

01:48:47.121 --> 01:48:51.158 region:rollup2
FOR THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS.

01:48:48.389 --> 01:48:52.593 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALREADY ON OUR CAMPUSES.

01:48:51.158 --> 01:48:54.094 region:rollup2
A IN ADDITION WE'RE REQUESTING

01:48:52.593 --> 01:48:55.496 region:rollup2

WE'VE KEPT PACE ALSO WITH

01:52:04.952 --> 01:52:08.989 region:rollup2
INCREASING HEALTH CARE A PENSION

01:52:07.254 --> 01:52:10.791 region:rollup2
COSTS ANOTHER MANDATORY COST

01:52:08.989 --> 01:52:12.759 region:rollup2
INCREASES OVER THIS TIME.

01:52:10.791 --> 01:52:14.595 region:rollup2
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST.

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:15.963 region:rollup2
AND WILL FOCUS WILL BE ON THIS

01:52:14.595 --> 01:52:17.164 region:rollup2
ON THE NEXT FEW SLIDES OUT WE

01:52:15.963 --> 01:52:18.699 region:rollup2
BUT WE WERE ABLE TO START THE

01:52:17.164 --> 01:52:20.200 region:rollup2
GRADUATION INITIATIVE.

01:52:18.699 --> 01:52:22.369 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REALLY AN EMPHASIS ON

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:24.171 region:rollup2
ON THOSE TWO TO WATCH PERSISTING

01:52:22.369 --> 01:52:25.872 region:rollup2

TO ADD TO DELIVER THAT TO THEM.

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:33.280 region:rollup2
SO WE TURN TO PAGE THREE.

01:52:31.712 --> 01:52:35.682 region:rollup2
TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.283 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE GOING FOR TODAY AND

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:37.417 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT OUR BUDGET ASK WILL

01:52:36.283 --> 01:52:42.990 region:rollup2
BE.

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:44.491 region:rollup2

01:53:07.848 --> 01:53:10.984 region:rollup2
FAR RIGHT SIDE. THAT'S.

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:13.020 region:rollup2
IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:14.621 region:rollup2
COLUMN AND THEN OUR PROGRESS TO

01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.455 region:rollup2
DATE JUSTIN TWENTY SEVENTEEN.

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.257 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT WE'VE DONE A PRETTY

FUNDING WOULD BEEN ABLE TO

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:23.664 region:rollup2
INVEST LIKE I DESCRIBED ALREADY.

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:24.765 region:rollup2

DOESN'T SURPRISE HOW WE HOW WE

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:46.386 region:rollup2
LAY ASIDE EVERY YEAR BUT I THINK

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:47.521 region:rollup2
IT'S ILLUSTRATIVE OF OF A NUMBER

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:49.656 region:rollup2

FOR TRANSFERS AT THE SEAT AT

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.997 region:rollup2
THAT ME COLLEGES WE NEED

01:55:02.329 --> 01:55:05.232 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:07.501 region:rollup2
OFFER THEM A SEAT AT THE C.

01:55:05.232 --> 01:55:08.535 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:55:07.501 --> 01:55:09.202 region:rollup2
AND AFTER YEARS OF STAGNANT

01:55:08.535 --> 01:55:10.637 region:rollup2

A FIVE YEAR PERIOD.

01:55:13.907 --> 01:55:16.777 region:rollup2

AND ON AVERAGE THAT'S ABOUT

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.649 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT PER YEAR THAT'S

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:23.116 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE TO THOSE THAT HAVE

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:25.519 region:rollup2
BEEN RECEIVED BY STATE

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:27.220 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:55:25.519 --> 01:55:28.688 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PURPOSE OF THIS PAGE

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.157 region:rollup2
IS TO BEGIN ANSWERING THIS

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:32.325 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S QUESTION WHICH IS

01:55:30.157 --> 01:55:32.826 region:rollup2
NAMELY WATER SEES SHE'S THOUGHTS

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:34.694 region:rollup2
ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:55:32.826 --> 01:55:36.463 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:37.964 region:rollup2
NOW THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A

01:55:36.463 --> 01:55:39.533 region:rollup2
PROVIDES ABOUT A ONE POINT FOUR

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:41.168 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASED WERE OPREME

01:55:39.533 --> 01:55:42.335 region:rollup2
BUDGET WHICH FALLS ABOUT ONE

01:55:41.168 --> 01:55:43.970 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:45.305 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SHORT OF I REQUEST THEY

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:47.407 region:rollup2
SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE.

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:48.375 region:rollup2
LIKE WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED

01:55:47.407 --> 01:55:50.143 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:51.678 region:rollup2
GET I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE

01:55:50.143 --> 01:55:52.979 region:rollup2
WITH SIT WITH YOU SEE TO A LARGE

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:54.981 region:rollup2
EXTENT EACH UP OUR CORE

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:56.683 region:rollup2
OPERATING FUNDS ARE FUNDED ABOUT

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:58.151 region:rollup2
HALF BY TUITION AND HALF BY

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:59.853 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

01:55:58.151 --> 01:56:01.221 region:rollup2
SO WHEN IT'S WHEN IT'S SIDE

01:55:59.853 --> 01:56:02.155 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED AS A THREE PERCENT

01:56:01.221 --> 01:56:03.323 region:rollup2
INCREASE OR FOUR PERCENT

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:04.691 region:rollup2
INCREASE YOU IMMEDIATELY HAVE A

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:06.159 region:rollup2
OF A GENERAL FUND INCREASE YOU

01:56:04.691 --> 01:56:07.260 region:rollup2
HAVE TO IMMEDIATELY FIGURE OUT

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:08.562 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT. HOW DOES THAT

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:09.729 region:rollup2
APPLY TO THE ENTIRETY OF THE

01:56:08.562 --> 01:56:10.997 region:rollup2
OPERATING BUDGET WILL IT WILL

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:12.566 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY MEANS IT'S ABOUT HALF

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:14.234 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY? YOU HEAR

01:56:12.566 --> 01:56:15.435 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NUMBERS WE'RE TALKING

01:56:14.234 --> 01:56:17.370 region:rollup2
ABOUT FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:18.939 region:rollup2
WHAT HOW DOES THAT GROW THE

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:20.707 region:rollup2
ENTIRETY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:56:18.939 --> 01:56:23.710 region:rollup2
BUDGET NOT JUST ONE PIECE OF

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:25.712 region:rollup2
THAT REVENUE SOURCE.

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:26.913 region:rollup2
I SO SO THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S A

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:28.281 region:rollup2
GAP OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:29.483 region:rollup2
ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:31.585 region:rollup2
I IF YOU SEE ON THE LEFT COLUMN

01:56:29.483 --> 01:56:33.320 region:rollup2
HERE IT SHOWS HOW FAR WE COULD

01:56:31.585 --> 01:56:33.954 region:rollup2
STRETCH THAT NINETY TWO MILLION

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.288 region:rollup2
DOLLARS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE

01:56:33.954 --> 01:56:36.389 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR.

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:37.557 region:rollup2
WHEN MEASURED AGAINST

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:39.192 region:rollup2
<u>NIVERSITIES ENTIRE OPERATE</u>

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:40.994 region:rollup2
BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:42.495 region:rollup2
INCREASE PROVIDES LESS THAN HALF

01:56:40.994 --> 01:56:44.130 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF INFLATION.

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:45.632 region:rollup2
AND IS SIXTY ONE MILLION SHORT

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:47.434 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE NEED SIMPLY TO COVER

01:56:45.632 --> 01:56:48.869 region:rollup2
OUR COMPENSATION INCREASES FOR

01:56:47.434 --> 01:56:50.604 region:rollup2
FACULTY AND STAFF.

01:56:48.869 --> 01:56:51.404 region:rollup2
AND ARE MANDATORY COST INCREASES

01:56:50.604 --> 01:56:53.306 region:rollup2
LIKE IT'S HEALTH CARE AND

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:54.274 region:rollup2
PENSION COSTS.

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:56.109 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THIS

01:56:54.274 --> 01:56:57.944 region:rollup2
SLIDE THE THE SIXTY ONE MILLION

01:56:56.109 --> 01:57:00.514 region:rollup2
IS DEPICTED IN THAT IN THAT RED

01:56:57.944 --> 01:57:01.615 region:rollup2
AREA OF THE OF THE DISPLAY.

01:57:00.514 --> 01:57:02.849 region:rollup2
SO WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM

01:57:01.615 --> 01:57:04.384 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:05.218 region:rollup2
WILL BE A TOUGH BUDGET YEAR FOR

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.720 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE ME THAT'S I THINK

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:08.321 region:rollup2
WE'VE.

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.823 region:rollup2
SHOWN HERE PRETTY CLEARLY SO

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:10.390 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES IF IF.

01:57:09.823 --> 01:57:11.791 region:rollup2
IF YOU GET TO THE END OF THE

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:13.493 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:14.995 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A SITUATION WHERE.

01:57:13.493 --> 01:57:16.263 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR SHE RECEIVED ONLY

01:57:14.995 --> 01:57:17.964 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WE

01:57:16.263 --> 01:57:19.633 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO CHOICES THAT WERE

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:21.034 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE REALLY TROUBLING I

01:57:19.633 --> 01:57:22.202 region:rollup2
THINK IN A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:23.737 region:rollup2
LOT OF NEW REVENUE COMING TO THE

01:57:22.202 --> 01:57:24.971 region:rollup2
STATE. THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR

01:57:23.737 --> 01:57:25.839 region:rollup2
NEW INVESTMENT UNIVERSITIES

01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:27.040 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST THING IS THE

01:57:25.839 --> 01:57:28.608 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WILL OUR CAMPUS

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.543 region:rollup2
PRESIDENTS

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:31.311 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE

01:57:29.543 --> 01:57:33.113 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT. DECISIONS TO COVER

01:57:31.311 --> 01:57:35.115 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.

01:57:33.113 --> 01:57:36.616 region:rollup2
RESULTING IN POTENTIAL DECREASES

01:57:35.115 --> 01:57:37.984 region:rollup2
AND CAMPUS OPERATIONS INCLUDING

01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:39.319 region:rollup2
APP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:40.453 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC SUPPORTS

01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:42.122 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO BE ABLE TO WE

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:43.189 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO THERE.

01:57:42.122 --> 01:57:44.591 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S JUST THE STARK

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:46.526 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT WE FACE IF IF

01:57:44.591 --> 01:57:47.027 region:rollup2
NOTHING CHANGES.

01:57:46.526 --> 01:57:48.662 region:rollup2
IN IN THE IN THE BUDGET

01:57:47.027 --> 01:57:50.964 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:57:48.662 --> 01:57:52.132 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT. IS IS IS

01:57:50.964 --> 01:57:53.099 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING FOR THE SEIZE YOU TO

01:57:52.132 --> 01:57:54.434 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IS THAT THE TRUSTEES

01:57:53.099 --> 01:57:55.969 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:57.771 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZE IT TUITION INCREASE TO

01:57:55.969 --> 01:57:59.940 region:rollup2
MEET THOSE VERY BASIC FINANCIAL

01:57:57.771 --> 01:58:01.341 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF OUR CAMPUSES.

01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:03.276 region:rollup2
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:58:01.341 --> 01:58:04.311 region:rollup2
THIS THAT.

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:05.879 region:rollup2
A POTENTIAL NEGATIVE BUDGET

01:58:04.311 --> 01:58:07.714 region:rollup2
SCENARIO TODAY WOULD NOT PASS

01:58:05.879 --> 01:58:09.983 region:rollup2
SET UP SEE ISSUE STUDENTS AND

01:58:07.714 --> 01:58:10.550 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S ECONOMY FOR. WHAT WE

01:58:09.983 --> 01:58:12.452 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE TO BE A STELLAR?

A STELLAR OUR FUTURE FOR

01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:17.257 region:rollup2

01:58:19.359 --> 01:58:22.362 region:rollup2
DEGREES AT THE CSU EVERY YEAR.

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:24.998 region:rollup2
IN A TIME WHEN THE STATE IS A

01:58:22.362 --> 01:58:26.600 region:rollup2
MULTIBILLION DOLLAR A SURPLUS.

01:58:24.998 --> 01:58:28.068 region:rollup2
A WE BELIEVE THAT NO OTHER

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.536 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT HAS THE SAME

01:58:28.068 --> 01:58:31.471 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO POSITIVELY IMPACT

01:58:29.536 --> 01:58:32.439 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OF THE STATE.

01:58:31.471 --> 01:58:37.310 region:rollup2
SO PAGE FIVE.

01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:39.245 region:rollup2

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:32.692 region:rollup2
AS YOU CAN SEE THE COMMUNITY

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:33.993 region:rollup2
COLLEGES HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

02:00:32.692 --> 02:00:35.662 region:rollup2

CONSIDER ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM.

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:18.771 region:rollup2
AND AS YOU CAN SEE WHILE THE

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:20.306 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:21.941 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IN SOME YEARS THIS

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:22.909 region:rollup2
MEASURE OF WORKLOAD IS MORE

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:24.778 region:rollup2
VOLATILE THAN CHANGES IN FUNDING

02:01:22.909 --> 02:01:26.246 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN.

02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:27.647 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED AFTER YES IS THE

02:01:26.246 --> 02:01:29.015 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL MEASURE USED IN THE

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:30.517 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS THROUGH THE

02:01:29.015 --> 02:01:32.452 region:rollup2
GENERAL PORTION IT SO WELL

VOLATILE FUNDING PICTURE.

02:01:38.191 --> 02:01:41.060 region:rollup2
SLIDE FOUR COMBINES THESE TWO

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:42.395 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS PICTURES

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.730 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT FUNDING IS THE

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:45.532 region:rollup2
LOWEST OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:47.167 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THE OTHER SEGMENTS

02:01:45.532 --> 02:01:48.568 region:rollup2
ARE SHOWN IN THE LA ILL REPORT.

02:01:47.167 --> 02:01:49.836 region:rollup2
AND THESE DIFFERENCES HAVE LONG

02:01:48.568 --> 02:01:51.371 region:rollup2
BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED IN STATE

02:01:49.836 --> 02:01:52.906 region:rollup2

02:01:51.371 --> 02:01:54.841 region:rollup2
FEATURE OF THE MASTER PLAN.

02:01:52.906 --> 02:01:55.708 region:rollup2
AS YOU CONSIDER OF THIS YEAR'S

02:01:54.841 --> 02:01:57.844 region:rollup2
BUDGET THOUGH WE WANT TO MAKE

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:59.546 region:rollup2

.

02:07:02.181 --> 02:07:06.285 region:rollup2
YOU SEE IS ASKING FOR A FIVE

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:08.020 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING FOR FIVE

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:09.288 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MORE GRADUATE STUDENTS

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.224 region:rollup2
SO FROM UC WHY IS THAT.

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:12.792 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:07:11.224 --> 02:07:14.660 region:rollup2

STRUCTURES FOR UNDERGRADUATE SO

02:07:36.749 --> 02:07:40.686 region:rollup2

TWO THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES WE

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:44.557 region:rollup2
NEED A WAY TO GIVE THEM

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:46.826 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION.

02:07:44.557 --> 02:07:49.028 region:rollup2
THROUGH DISCUSSION SECTIONS WE

02:07:46.826 --> 02:07:50.763 region:rollup2
NEED AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTORS

02:07:49.028 --> 02:07:52.365 region:rollup2
OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:52.932 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS THE TEN THOUSAND

02:07:52.365 --> 02:07:55.334 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:07:52.932 --> 02:07:57.436 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT MARGINAL COST BUT

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:59.372 region:rollup2
IT.

02:07:57.436 --> 02:08:04.944 region:rollup2
FOR FOR EACH GRADUATE STUDENT

02:07:59.372 --> 02:08:07.313 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW WE DERIVE DOT NUMBER.

02:08:04.944 --> 02:08:09.081 region:rollup2
OKAY I I'VE A FEW QUESTIONS AND

02:08:07.313 --> 02:08:09.549 region:rollup2
I GUESS I'LL START WITH THAT WAS

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:11.918 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE. AYE AYE AYE

02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:13.486 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

02:08:11.918 --> 02:08:14.887 region:rollup2
AND NEVER GOT RESPECT

02:08:13.486 --> 02:08:17.590 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE

02:08:14.887 --> 02:08:18.991 region:rollup2
MATHEMATICS OF THIS TABLE. UP

02:08:17.590 --> 02:08:20.726 region:rollup2
BUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT.

02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:23.429 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOP PRIORITY WHEN WE GO

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:24.830 region:rollup2
IN. AND OUR COMMUNITIES GO TO

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:26.432 region:rollup2
THE PARK A GROCERY STORE IS

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:28.100 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:29.602 region:rollup2
RIGHT GRAND WE MAY RUN INTO A

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.636 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBER IN THAT CONTACT

02:08:29.602 --> 02:08:32.505 region:rollup2
THAT FUND. PAY FOR THE

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:33.773 region:rollup2
COMPENSATION BUT THAT OUR

02:08:32.505 --> 02:08:35.541 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:08:33.773 --> 02:08:37.810 region:rollup2
WE TURN AWAY THIRTY THOUSAND

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:40.012 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA KIDS EVERY YEAR AT

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:41.314 region:rollup2
THE CSU SYSTEM SO. IT'S SOMEWHAT

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:43.849 region:rollup2
HARD TO SWALLOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:08:41.314 --> 02:08:45.885 region:rollup2
THE PRIORITIES ACCESS.

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:47.386 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST

02:08:45.885 --> 02:08:49.622 region:rollup2
RATS TOP BUT IT'S.

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:50.923 region:rollup2
LAST THING OF IMPORTANCE FROM.

02:08:49.622 --> 02:08:52.325 region:rollup2
FROM THE CS YOU I JUST WANNA

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:53.759 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

02:08:52.325 --> 02:08:54.961 region:rollup2
THING OF IMPORTANCE.

02:08:53.759 --> 02:08:57.296 region:rollup2
THAT WE AS REPRESENTATIVES HERE

02:08:54.961 --> 02:08:58.664 region:rollup2
FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OUT

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:59.498 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO POINT THAT OUT WELL

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:01.400 region:rollup2
IF YOU IF I COULD.

02:08:59.498 --> 02:09:02.768 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER UP.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:05.137 region:rollup2
THAT THAT LIST IS NOT

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:06.272 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A RANK ORDER I AM

02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:07.573 region:rollup2
WELL AWARE THAT I I JUST WANTED

02:09:06.272 --> 02:09:09.242 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT CLEAR IN THE PAST

02:09:07.573 --> 02:09:10.843 region:rollup2
YEARS WE'VE WORKED WITH YOU IN

02:09:09.242 --> 02:09:12.478 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT TRYING

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:14.180 region:rollup2
TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE. VERY

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:15.715 region:rollup2
BASIC NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY

02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:17.750 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO

02:09:15.715 --> 02:09:19.952 region:rollup2
SPREAD THESE FUNDS. AS WELL AS

02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:20.886 region:rollup2
WE COULD AND I THINK.

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:22.288 region:rollup2
BASICALLY VICE BY JUST BY

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:24.490 region:rollup2
WALKING THROUGH MY PRESENTATION

02:09:22.288 --> 02:09:26.225 region:rollup2
EARLIER DEMONSTRATE THAT WE HAVE

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:26.726 region:rollup2
YEAH INCREASED ACCESS TO THE

02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:27.893 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY BY THIRTY ONE

02:09:26.726 --> 02:09:28.961 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:30.429 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FULL

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:31.831 region:rollup2
TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT SO.

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:33.499 region:rollup2
IT'S A PRIORITY OF OURS AS WELL

02:09:31.831 --> 02:09:34.700 region:rollup2
FOR SURE I THINK A CHALLENGE

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:36.402 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THAT'S SO UNIQUE

02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:38.271 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR. IS THAT.

02:09:36.402 --> 02:09:40.373 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE WITH THE YEAR

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:41.540 region:rollup2
OVER YEAR DROP IN PROPOSED

02:09:40.373 --> 02:09:43.409 region:rollup2
FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNOR.

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:44.877 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR HE PROPOSED ABORIGINE

02:09:43.409 --> 02:09:46.545 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN

02:09:44.877 --> 02:09:47.580 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:48.314 region:rollup2
FOR THE C. ISSUE AND THIS YEAR

02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:49.649 region:rollup2
IT'S NINETY TWO IT'S A

02:09:48.314 --> 02:09:51.250 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DROP I THINK IT'S

02:09:49.649 --> 02:09:52.752 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. SO

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:55.087 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT REALLY

02:09:52.752 --> 02:09:56.589 region:rollup2
THAT EATS INTO WAR HOW DO YOU

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:57.490 region:rollup2
EAT. NOW WE'RE EATING INTO THE

02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:59.358 region:rollup2
POINT OF.

02:09:57.490 --> 02:10:01.060 region:rollup2
HOW TO COVER THOSE BASIC COSTS

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:02.795 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE?

02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:04.063 region:rollup2
LOCK DOWN IN TERMS OF CONTRACTS

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:05.665 region:rollup2
OR AND COST THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

02:10:04.063 --> 02:10:07.166 region:rollup2
INCURRING FROM RATE INCREASES BY

02:10:05.665 --> 02:10:08.801 region:rollup2
CALPERS FOR PENSIONS OR FOR

02:10:07.166 --> 02:10:10.536 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE. SO THAT'S WERE

02:10:08.801 --> 02:10:11.837 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT REALIZING THIS POINT

02:10:10.536 --> 02:10:14.407 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY A CHALLENGE.

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:15.508 region:rollup2
I THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S

02:10:14.407 --> 02:10:17.109 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE BY THE END OF

THE BUT IN THE PROCESS HERE.

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:20.346 region:rollup2
WE WE HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:21.480 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TO SPREAD MORE OF THIS

02:10:20.346 --> 02:10:23.683 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.351 region:rollup2
STATE TO ALL THESE OTHER. IN A

02:10:23.683 --> 02:10:26.018 region:rollup2
AREAS INCLUDING ENROLLMENT.

GRADUATION A SHIP AND

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:29.822 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THIS PET THIS

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:31.557 region:rollup2
JUNCTURE IT'S IT'S REALLY A DIRE

UNDERGRADUATE. ADMISSIONS IN THE

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:47.873 region:rollup2

OF A SPOT AND ONE. I CAMPUS AND

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:56.782 region:rollup2
SO HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK

02:10:55.815 --> 02:10:57.483 region:rollup2
OUT.

02:10:56.782 --> 02:10:59.151 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:10:57.483 --> 02:10:59.852 region:rollup2
STILL IN THE IN THE DEVELOPMENT

02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:00.720 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

02:10:59.852 --> 02:11:02.455 region:rollup2
IF.

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.155 region:rollup2
YOUR STAFF FOR OTHERS HAVE BEEN

02:11:02.455 --> 02:11:05.091 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING.

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:06.992 region:rollup2
OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS HAD

02:11:05.091 --> 02:11:08.194 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OF THAT HEARING SIR

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:09.895 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I. ITEMS THAT THEY'VE

02:11:08.194 --> 02:11:11.797 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:12.431 region:rollup2
ON A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS ON ONE

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:14.567 region:rollup2
THING THAT I THINK IS

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:15.735 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING ROM RIGHT NOW IS IS

02:11:14.567 --> 02:11:17.870 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THREE THINGS IN

02:11:15.735 --> 02:11:19.505 region:rollup2
PLAY AT MINIMUM. ONE YOU HAVE

02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:21.574 region:rollup2
THE ELIGIBILITY STUDY ARE

02:11:19.505 --> 02:11:23.976 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE ARE.

02:11:21.574 --> 02:11:25.678 region:rollup2
CARPOOL IS FORTY ONE PERCENT

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:27.113 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WERE WERE GRAPPLING

02:11:25.678 --> 02:11:28.948 region:rollup2
WITH THAT PARTICULAR ITEM.

02:11:27.113 --> 02:11:29.949 region:rollup2
I WERE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE

02:11:28.948 --> 02:11:31.717 region:rollup2
NOTION OF.

02:11:29.949 --> 02:11:33.018 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE OF POLICY

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:34.587 region:rollup2
STATEMENTS THAT COME THE

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:36.822 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR WANTED

02:11:34.587 --> 02:11:38.591 region:rollup2
US TO TO DEVELOP ONE OF THOSE

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:40.059 region:rollup2
BEING TO READ DIRECTOR CAMPUSES

02:11:38.591 --> 02:11:41.594 region:rollup2
THAT MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL PASSED

02:11:40.059 --> 02:11:43.329 region:rollup2
THE THE OTHER THING IS TO.

02:11:41.594 --> 02:11:44.797 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS FOR

02:11:43.329 --> 02:11:45.798 region:rollup2
LOCAL STUDENTS AT THEIR LOCAL

02:11:44.797 --> 02:11:47.767 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

02:11:45.798 --> 02:11:48.267 region:rollup2
IN ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT

02:11:47.767 --> 02:11:49.802 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE NOTION THAT.

02:11:48.267 --> 02:11:50.803 region:rollup2
.

02:11:49.802 --> 02:11:52.805 region:rollup2
WITH TIGHT BUDGETS IT'LL BE

02:11:50.803 --> 02:11:53.773 region:rollup2
TOUGH TO.

02:11:52.805 --> 02:11:55.508 region:rollup2
KEEP KEEP IT WRONG THAT WHERE IT

02:11:53.773 --> 02:11:56.976 region:rollup2
IS.

02:11:55.508 --> 02:11:58.310 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT A

02:11:56.976 --> 02:11:59.512 region:rollup2
STANDING BODY THAT'S ALWAYS

02:11:58.310 --> 02:12:01.580 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THIS IS CALLED THE

02:11:59.512 --> 02:12:02.982 region:rollup2
MISSION ADVISORY COUNCIL.

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.317 region:rollup2
IT'S A CROSS SECTION OF THE

02:12:02.982 --> 02:12:07.820 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY THEY ARE

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:09.588 region:rollup2
VIGOROUSLY MEETING DEBATING ARE

02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.056 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING HOW TO BLEND ALL OF

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:13.759 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:14.360 region:rollup2
ISSUES INTO ONE COHESIVE POLICY

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:15.895 region:rollup2
THAT WILL WORK BEST FOR THE C.

02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:16.796 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:12:15.895 --> 02:12:18.564 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOT OF BACKGROUND

02:12:16.796 --> 02:12:20.499 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAY IT'S STILL TO BE

02:12:18.564 --> 02:12:21.434 region:rollup2
DETERMINED. A A SEVEN MEMBER

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:22.368 region:rollup2
MCCARTY.

02:12:21.434 --> 02:12:25.538 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

02:12:22.368 --> 02:12:27.039 region:rollup2
LIKELY AN ACTION ITEM IN MARCH

02:12:25.538 --> 02:12:28.574 region:rollup2
AND SO BY THAT POINT I THINK THE

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:29.375 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THE COUNCIL

02:12:28.574 --> 02:12:31.343 region:rollup2
OF HAD.

02:12:29.375 --> 02:12:32.878 region:rollup2
NETWORK UNDER ITS UNDER ITS

02:12:31.343 --> 02:12:34.647 region:rollup2
BELT. WHERE THEY CAN NAM PUT

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:35.981 region:rollup2
TOGETHER OUT OF A PROPOSAL I

02:12:34.647 --> 02:12:37.817 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WILL BENEFIT?

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:39.852 region:rollup2
TODD

02:12:37.817 --> 02:12:41.120 region:rollup2
STATE AND OUR STUDENTS A LITTLE

02:12:39.852 --> 02:12:42.488 region:rollup2
BIT BETTER THAN OUR CURRENT.

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.055 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN OUR

02:12:42.488 --> 02:12:44.990 region:rollup2
CURRENT SITUATION WE'RE IN.

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:46.659 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:49.728 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND AND I WILL NOT TO

02:12:46.659 --> 02:12:52.198 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THE UC AND CSU I THINK

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:54.166 region:rollup2
IN YEARS PAST TO WE WE HAVE. A

02:12:52.198 --> 02:12:56.068 region:rollup2
FOUGHT FOR INCREASES ABOVE THE

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:58.671 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I WORK IN IT

02:12:56.068 --> 02:12:59.939 region:rollup2
NO REASON WE WHEN CAN YOU DO SO.

02:12:58.671 --> 02:13:02.107 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR AS WELL WITH BUT

02:12:59.939 --> 02:13:03.142 region:rollup2
STILL THINK THE GOVERNOR IT IS

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:04.076 region:rollup2
CORRECT THAT WE WON AT.

02:13:03.142 --> 02:13:05.544 region:rollup2
LOOK ABOUT WAYS WE CAN TIGHTEN

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:07.580 region:rollup2
THE BELT BUT AS FAR AS THE

02:13:05.544 --> 02:13:09.148 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES AND WOULD YOU

02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:10.149 region:rollup2
SEE AS OUR AUDITOR POINTED OUT

02:13:09.148 --> 02:13:12.718 region:rollup2
AND WE TALKED LAST TO RETHINK

02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:14.386 region:rollup2
THEIR SON. EFFICIENCIES IN IN

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:15.287 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:13:14.386 --> 02:13:16.489 region:rollup2
THERE'S YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:17.723 region:rollup2
THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION

02:13:16.489 --> 02:13:18.824 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN.

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:20.426 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:22.661 region:rollup2
EARMARKED FOR THIRTY YEARS SON

02:13:20.426 --> 02:13:24.196 region:rollup2
SOME ARE GREAT SOME LOOK GOOD ON

02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:25.231 region:rollup2
PAPER BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

02:13:24.196 --> 02:13:26.599 region:rollup2
MAKE A TOUGH CHOICE.

02:13:25.231 --> 02:13:28.167 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET CLIMATE WHAT'S OUR

02:13:26.599 --> 02:13:29.668 region:rollup2
HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THAT

02:13:28.167 --> 02:13:31.637 region:rollup2
SCARES DOLLAR MAYBE.

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:33.072 region:rollup2
AND ROLLING AYE MORE CALIFORNIA

02:13:31.637 --> 02:13:34.573 region:rollup2
KIDS IS A CHOICE WE WANNA FOCUS

02:13:33.072 --> 02:13:37.176 region:rollup2
ON SO THAT'S A CONTINUING.

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:37.576 region:rollup2
CONTINUED ISSUE I I I DO WANT TO

02:13:37.176 --> 02:13:38.611 region:rollup2
ASK YOU ONE POINT.

02:13:37.576 --> 02:13:38.878 region:rollup2
.

02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:40.512 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

02:13:38.878 --> 02:13:42.281 region:rollup2
.

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:42.481 region:rollup2
YOU THE CHARTS YOU HAVE THERE ON

02:13:42.281 --> 02:13:45.651 region:rollup2
THE.

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:47.286 region:rollup2
THAT THIS STUDENT TO FACULTY

02:13:45.651 --> 02:13:51.390 region:rollup2
RATIO YOU SAID THAT BY GOING

02:13:47.286 --> 02:13:52.525 region:rollup2
DOWN. OF ONE FOUR POINTS.

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:53.792 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS I'M TO BETTER.

02:13:52.525 --> 02:13:54.860 region:rollup2
FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIO WOULD

02:13:53.792 --> 02:13:56.128 region:rollup2
COST

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.696 region:rollup2
I THINK TO WONDERING EIGHTY

02:13:56.128 --> 02:14:00.566 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TO GO FROM

02:13:57.696 --> 02:14:02.268 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE TO ONE AND. YOU KNOW

02:14:00.566 --> 02:14:03.736 region:rollup2
WE AYE AYE WE'D RATHER HAVE YOU

02:14:02.268 --> 02:14:05.504 region:rollup2
KNOW SERVE TWENTY THOUSAND MORE

02:14:03.736 --> 02:14:06.572 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA KIDS BUT THEN YOU

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:08.007 region:rollup2
WOULD ARGUE THAT STUDENTS ARE

02:14:06.572 --> 02:14:10.776 region:rollup2
SERVE BETTER HAVING A BETTER

02:14:08.007 --> 02:14:12.745 region:rollup2
STUDENT TO FACULTY. RATIO BUT AS

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:14.113 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER HAS GONE UP YOUR

02:14:12.745 --> 02:14:15.781 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATE.

02:14:14.113 --> 02:14:17.650 region:rollup2
HAS SUCCESS RATE HAS GONE DOWN

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:19.285 region:rollup2
SO HOW HOW DO YOU.

02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:20.319 region:rollup2
RECONCILE US TWO POINT SO YOU

02:14:19.285 --> 02:14:21.654 region:rollup2
THE IN OTHER WORDS IT WORK YOUR

02:14:20.319 --> 02:14:23.322 region:rollup2
CUP WITH WHERE THANK WE LIVE PER

02:14:21.654 --> 02:14:24.223 region:rollup2
LAMENTING THAT WE HAVE. A MORE

02:14:23.322 --> 02:14:25.925 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

02:14:24.223 --> 02:14:28.093 region:rollup2
IN A CLASS.

02:14:25.925 --> 02:14:28.961 region:rollup2
PER FACULTY IN THE LAST DECADE

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:30.996 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR EARLIER

02:14:28.961 --> 02:14:32.298 region:rollup2
CHARTS THE UNIT THE GRADUATION

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:34.800 region:rollup2
SUCCESS RATE FOR THOSE STUDENTS

02:14:32.298 --> 02:14:39.338 region:rollup2
HAS GOTTEN BETTER.

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:41.206 region:rollup2
BUT HAD HAD YOU ANSWER THAT.

02:14:39.338 --> 02:14:42.841 region:rollup2
WE WE DO THINK THAT STUDENTS

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:44.410 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IN

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:46.345 region:rollup2
SETTINGS WHERE THEY HAVE MORE

02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:48.314 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO A FACULTY MEMBER IN

02:14:46.345 --> 02:14:49.648 region:rollup2
SUCH SETTINGS. UNDERGRADUATES

02:14:48.314 --> 02:14:51.517 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:53.452 region:rollup2
RESEARCH OR DISCUSSION THAT THEY

02:14:51.517 --> 02:14:56.021 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT HAVE IF THEY'RE IN A

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:58.457 region:rollup2
LECTURE HALL WITH. THREE OR FIVE

02:14:56.021 --> 02:15:00.659 region:rollup2
HUNDRED OTHER STUDENTS

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:02.828 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WIDE WE THINK IT MAKES

02:15:00.659 --> 02:15:05.531 region:rollup2
SENSE FOR OVERALL QUALITY LONG

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:06.098 region:rollup2
TERM. TO AT LEAST KEEP THE

02:15:05.531 --> 02:15:09.234 region:rollup2
STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO OF

02:15:06.098 --> 02:15:11.036 region:rollup2
FLAT.

02:15:09.234 --> 02:15:13.305 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MADE GRADE.

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:15.641 region:rollup2
GREAT STRIDES IN INCREASING.

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:17.443 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS AT UC

02:15:15.641 --> 02:15:19.144 region:rollup2
GRADUATION RATES AMONG OUR

02:15:17.443 --> 02:15:21.580 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADUATES ARE UP.

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:23.082 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:25.284 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO INCREASES IN STUDENT

02:15:23.082 --> 02:15:26.919 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ON OUR

02:15:25.284 --> 02:15:29.188 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES. SO THERE ARE

02:15:26.919 --> 02:15:31.690 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED TUTORING THERE'S.

02:15:29.188 --> 02:15:33.158 region:rollup2
NEW A WE HAVE STARTED STUDENTS

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:35.461 region:rollup2
CENTERS ON CAMPUSES WHERE

02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:37.763 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CAN COME IN GET PURER.

02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:39.898 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE AND MENTORING.

02:15:37.763 --> 02:15:42.534 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO HELPED THEM DURING

02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:44.703 region:rollup2
THEIR DURING THEIR TIMES IN

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:46.939 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BUT WE THINK IT'S A.

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:49.975 region:rollup2
GREAT GOAL FOR THE SYSTEM TO

02:15:46.939 --> 02:15:51.910 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIGHT TO WIN. TO REDUCE

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:53.078 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENT FACULTY RATIO BUT WE

02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:54.613 region:rollup2
REALIZE IT'S PROBABLY NOT

02:15:53.078 --> 02:15:55.981 region:rollup2
REALISTIC FOR THIS COMING YEAR

02:15:54.613 --> 02:15:57.583 region:rollup2
YEAH I KNOW LOGICALLY IT MAKES

02:15:55.981 --> 02:16:00.052 region:rollup2
SENSE.

02:15:57.583 --> 02:16:01.420 region:rollup2
BEING IN A CLASS WITH THAT THAT.

02:16:00.052 --> 02:16:02.421 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR AND THIRTY STUDENTS

02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:04.590 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN BEING A CLASS WITH

02:16:02.421 --> 02:16:06.458 region:rollup2
THE. IN THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS.

02:16:04.590 --> 02:16:08.160 region:rollup2
BUT AS THE ALEJO POINTED OUT IN

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:10.663 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME WHEN THE RATIO

02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.230 region:rollup2

02:16:10.663 --> 02:16:13.298 region:rollup2

A FORTY FIVE PERCENT TO SIXTY

02:16:14.233 --> 02:16:17.669 region:rollup2
FIVE SO.

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:19.405 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE STUDENTS ARE MORE

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:21.006 region:rollup2
THESE MONIES ARE MORE RESILIENT

02:16:19.405 --> 02:16:23.609 region:rollup2
AND PERSISTENT THAN THAT. THAN

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:24.243 region:rollup2
THAT PRIOR GENERATIONS WE DO

02:16:23.609 --> 02:16:24.977 region:rollup2

WRITTEN VIGOR SEVEN.

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:08.420 region:rollup2
I I THINK THIS IS A.

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:08.887 region:rollup2
A SOFTBALL THAT I'M TALKING TO

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:10.689 region:rollup2
YOU BUT I.

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:13.592 region:rollup2

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:16.762 region:rollup2
IN THE PER PUPIL FUNDING.

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:18.397 region:rollup2
FROM AROUND TWO THOUSAND.

02:17:16.762 --> 02:17:20.499 region:rollup2
AND AND AND THAT.

02:17:18.397 --> 02:17:22.067 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU SEE WE ARE FAR FROM

02:17:20.499 --> 02:17:22.568 region:rollup2
RECOVERING FROM THE PEAK IN PER

02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:24.570 region:rollup2
PUPIL FUNDING.

02:17:22.568 --> 02:17:26.338 region:rollup2
YES.

02:17:24.570 --> 02:17:27.706 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:28.941 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:31.477 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM.

02:17:28.941 --> 02:17:33.579 region:rollup2
ADDED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND NEW

STUDENT ASSISTANCE TWO THOUSAND

02:17:33.579 --> 02:17:37.316 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT IS SO DRAMATIC ODD

02:17:35.781 --> 02:17:38.617 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF MORE STUDENTS THAT

02:17:37.316 --> 02:17:40.753 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DIVIDING THOSE RESOURCES

02:17:38.617 --> 02:17:43.522 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD CLEAN. UP ALSO OUR

02:17:40.753 --> 02:17:45.357 region:rollup2
STATE GENERAL FUND IS NOW ONLY

02:17:43.522 --> 02:17:46.825 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:48.460 region:rollup2
ACTUAL DOLLARS WHEN IT WAS IN

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:50.028 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SO YOU'RE TAKING

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:51.830 region:rollup2
THOSE RESOURCES AND DIVIDING

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:53.799 region:rollup2
THEM BETWEEN MORE STUDENTS WHAT

02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:55.868 region:rollup2
THIS DOES. IS IT SHIFTS THE

02:17:53.799 --> 02:17:58.804 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF THE INCREASED COST IN

02:17:55.868 --> 02:18:00.405 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ON TO STUDENT FEES.

02:17:58.804 --> 02:18:02.274 region:rollup2
SO COMING SO WE DO HAVE FEWER

02:18:00.405 --> 02:18:03.742 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO EDUCATE OUR EACH

02:18:02.274 --> 02:18:06.078 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT BY.

02:18:03.742 --> 02:18:07.713 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS

02:18:06.078 --> 02:18:09.214 region:rollup2
CHART DOES NOT SUBTRACT IT

02:18:07.713 --> 02:18:11.416 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SURPRISE THE FACT THAT

02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:13.585 region:rollup2
WE HAD OF MANDATORY RETIREMENT

02:18:11.416 --> 02:18:16.054 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE BROUGHT

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:17.956 region:rollup2
BACK GONE. IN TWENTY TEN.

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:20.225 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HAD TAKEN QUITE A LONG

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:23.228 region:rollup2
BREAK IN YOU SEE RETIREMENT

02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:25.931 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FROM CHARGING A. ITSELF

02:18:23.228 --> 02:18:27.499 region:rollup2
OURSELVES FOR. THE.

02:18:25.931 --> 02:18:29.067 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF WE HAVE

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:31.103 region:rollup2
PROMISED OUR EMPLOYEES THOSE

02:18:29.067 --> 02:18:32.771 region:rollup2
WERE RESTARTED AND ARE NOW AT

02:18:31.103 --> 02:18:34.439 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN PERCENT OF PAYROLL. SO

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:35.941 region:rollup2
IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT THAT

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:37.176 region:rollup2
CANNOT GO TO HIRING NEW

02:18:35.941 --> 02:18:38.810 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OKAY.

02:18:37.176 --> 02:18:40.245 region:rollup2
AND THEN ANOTHER THING THAT'S

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:40.813 region:rollup2
NOT BEING SUBTRACTED HERE IS TO

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:43.682 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID ALLOCATION OF

02:18:40.813 --> 02:18:45.317 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:47.619 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES OUT OF

02:18:45.317 --> 02:18:49.822 region:rollup2
ITS OWN FUNDS TO OUR STUDENTS.

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:51.790 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT

AND MY DISTRICT ALSO.

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:05.404 region:rollup2

DIVERSE STUDENT BODY TODAY THAN

02:21:20.072 --> 02:21:23.041 region:rollup2

MOBILITY BUT IT FOSTERS RACIAL

02:21:37.756 --> 02:21:40.926 region:rollup2
JUSTICE AS WELL AND JUST TO BE

02:21:39.491 --> 02:21:42.828 region:rollup2
CLEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT

02:21:40.926 --> 02:21:44.629 region:rollup2
COIN. FAILING TO SUFFICIENTLY

02:21:42.828 --> 02:21:46.331 region:rollup2
FUND THE CSU IS TO ACTIVELY

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:48.166 region:rollup2
WORSEN ALREADYEXISTING RACIAL

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:49.901 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES.

02:21:48.166 --> 02:21:51.837 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE IS ACCESS AND

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:53.372 region:rollup2
WE KNOW FOR WE KNOW THAT THE CSU

02:21:51.837 --> 02:21:55.374 region:rollup2
TURNED AWAY THIRTY ONE THOUSAND

02:21:53.372 --> 02:21:56.875 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED STUDENTS THIS PAST

02:21:55.374 --> 02:21:58.643 region:rollup2
YEAR DUE TO FUNDING. AND

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:59.978 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE CSU ZONE OWN

02:21:58.643 --> 02:22:01.613 region:rollup2
NUMBERS TWENTY TO THIRTY

02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:02.714 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR OVER

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:03.548 region:rollup2
THE LAST SIX.

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:05.517 region:rollup2
A AND.

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:05.951 region:rollup2
A.

02:22:05.517 --> 02:22:07.786 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IN CONTRAST.

02:22:05.951 --> 02:22:09.888 region:rollup2
.

02:22:07.786 --> 02:22:11.656 region:rollup2
DOES TO THE UC NINETY FOUR

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:13.592 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF CSU STUDENTS ARE FROM

02:22:11.656 --> 02:22:15.127 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. SO WE BELIEVE

02:22:13.592 --> 02:22:16.795 region:rollup2
REASONABLY SO THAT THIS TREND

02:22:15.127 --> 02:22:18.497 region:rollup2
WILL ONLY GET WORSE WITHOUT A

02:22:16.795 --> 02:22:20.265 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT BUDGET AUGMENTATION.

02:22:18.497 --> 02:22:21.700 region:rollup2
THESE ARE LIFE CHANCES MISSED BY

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:23.201 region:rollup2
REAL YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:25.137 region:rollup2
PROMISED A SEAT AT A FOUR YEAR

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:26.605 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

02:22:25.137 --> 02:22:28.106 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALSO CERTAINLY A CRISIS

02:22:26.605 --> 02:22:29.975 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:31.443 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC WELL BEING.

02:22:29.975 --> 02:22:32.778 region:rollup2
AT SO AS YOU ARE AWARE THE

02:22:31.443 --> 02:22:34.646 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNDER FUNDING

02:22:32.778 --> 02:22:35.914 region:rollup2
THIS THIS YES YOU WITH NINETY

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:38.016 region:rollup2

02:22:35.914 --> 02:22:39.151 region:rollup2
THIS THE CSU IS YOU HEARD

02:22:38.016 --> 02:22:40.952 region:rollup2
REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY

THREE MILLIONDOLLARS AND MY

ORGANIZATION CFA IS

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:44.790 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING.

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:47.793 region:rollup2
OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT

02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:49.561 region:rollup2
SIX MILLION DOLLARS SO IN SHORT.

02:22:47.793 --> 02:22:50.562 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY THE

02:22:49.561 --> 02:22:52.164 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IT IS YOU

02:22:50.562 --> 02:22:52.998 region:rollup2
DOUBLE TIME.

02:22:52.164 --> 02:22:54.099 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SO GREAT APPETITE

02:22:52.998 --> 02:22:56.535 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT.

02:22:54.099 --> 02:22:58.336 region:rollup2
.

02:22:56.535 --> 02:23:00.072 region:rollup2
BUT IF IF THE STATE REALLY WANTS

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:01.239 region:rollup2
TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DOWNTURN

02:23:00.072 --> 02:23:02.974 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD DO SO BY INVESTING IN

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:04.609 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION.

02:23:02.974 --> 02:23:05.977 region:rollup2
WORKERS FEEL OUR ECONOMY PEOPLE

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:07.679 region:rollup2
WITH FOR YEARS DEGREES ARE

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:09.314 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO ARE

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:11.349 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AND

02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:13.051 region:rollup2
DEGREES HELP LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:14.853 region:rollup2
POVERTY. IF YOU AGREE THAT

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:15.454 region:rollup2
BUDGET IT THAT BUDGETS ARE MORAL

02:23:14.853 --> 02:23:16.555 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS AS I THINK THAT YOU

02:23:15.454 --> 02:23:18.056 region:rollup2
DO.

02:23:16.555 --> 02:23:19.024 region:rollup2
I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:20.492 region:rollup2
WOULD AGREE THAT FUNDING THE

DREAMS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES

02:23:20.492 --> 02:23:23.595 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FAMILIES

JUST THIS PAST YEAR ACCOUNTING.

02:23:23.595 --> 02:23:26.465 region:rollup2
OF FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO EARN A

02:23:25.063 --> 02:23:32.204 region:rollup2
DEGREE IS MONEY WE'RE SPENDING

02:23:26.465 --> 02:23:33.472 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION.

02:23:38.043 --> 02:23:42.581 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE.

02:23:40.045 --> 02:23:44.816 region:rollup2
JENNIFER IAN THAT THE CSU

02:23:42.581 --> 02:23:46.051 region:rollup2
FUNDING REQUEST IS ABOUT THREE

02:23:44.816 --> 02:23:47.519 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

02:23:46.051 --> 02:23:50.055 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SHORT. IN A PARTICULAR

02:23:47.519 --> 02:23:51.289 region:rollup2
CONCERN TO ME IS WHAT HAPPENS TO

02:23:50.055 --> 02:23:53.658 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY A THROUGH G. ELIGIBLE

02:23:51.289 --> 02:23:55.127 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WATER TURNED AWAY BUT

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:57.429 region:rollup2
ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS.

02:23:55.127 --> 02:23:59.164 region:rollup2
AS THE PP I SEE NOTED ARM WE

02:23:57.429 --> 02:24:00.765 region:rollup2
NEED A RADICAL INTERVENTION IN A

02:23:59.164 --> 02:24:01.967 region:rollup2
SENATOR WERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:24:00.765 --> 02:24:03.735 region:rollup2
MIRCHI SAID WE NEED A RADICAL

02:24:01.967 --> 02:24:05.370 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION. INTO.

02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:06.037 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:08.139 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:09.374 region:rollup2
AND IN THE CSU WERE EXPECTED TO

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:10.509 region:rollup2
TAKE AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED

02:24:09.374 --> 02:24:12.144 region:rollup2
AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

02:24:10.509 --> 02:24:13.979 region:rollup2
TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM THE

02:24:12.144 --> 02:24:15.580 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. IF WE

02:24:13.979 --> 02:24:17.716 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT ONE

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:19.184 region:rollup2
POINT ONE MILLION DEGREE FOR

02:24:17.716 --> 02:24:22.320 region:rollup2
YOUR DEGREE SHORT FALL.

02:24:19.184 --> 02:24:24.222 region:rollup2
PROTECTED BY THE PP I SEE. AND

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:25.824 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING WE'RE

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:27.058 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:24:25.824 --> 02:24:28.860 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES NOT

02:24:27.058 --> 02:24:30.462 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:32.030 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT ALSO THE

02:24:30.462 --> 02:24:33.899 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN THE RECEIVING

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:35.934 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS. OTHERWISE THE

02:24:33.899 --> 02:24:37.669 region:rollup2
TRANSFER INITIATIVES THE ONLINE

COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHETHER IT

02:24:37.669 --> 02:24:41.907 region:rollup2
WORKS OR NOT OWNED THE

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:43.208 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED GUIDED PATHWAYS WILL

02:24:41.907 --> 02:24:46.011 region:rollup2
BE FOR NAUGHT BECAUSE STUDENTS

02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:47.712 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE A GUARANTEED SEAT. TO

02:24:46.011 --> 02:24:49.581 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE WE NEED TO

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:51.683 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED GENERATIONS OF

02:24:49.581 --> 02:24:53.785 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ON A FUTURE FOR THE

02:24:51.683 --> 02:24:58.123 region:rollup2
FUTURE DRIVERS OF THE STATE

02:24:53.785 --> 02:25:01.126 region:rollup2
ECONOMY. IT'S SHORT SIGHTED AND

02:24:58.123 --> 02:25:05.330 region:rollup2
AS ARE JENNIFER ALLUDED TO IT'S

02:25:01.126 --> 02:25:05.964 region:rollup2
AWFUL ALSO RACIALLY UNJUST

02:25:05.330 --> 02:25:06.665 region:rollup2
I'M AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE

02:25:05.964 --> 02:25:07.365 region:rollup2
BROWN ADMINISTRATION IS FIGHTING

02:25:06.665 --> 02:25:08.033 region:rollup2
AGAINST POLICIES THAT ARE COMING

02:25:07.365 --> 02:25:08.700 region:rollup2
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

02:25:08.033 --> 02:25:10.101 region:rollup2
WE DON'T LIKE THAT ARE RACIST.

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:11.136 region:rollup2
NATIVIST OF AND ARE HURTING OUR

02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:12.871 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WERE HURTING THOSE VERY

02:25:11.136 --> 02:25:14.673 region:rollup2
SAME STUDENTS BY NOT INVESTING

02:25:12.871 --> 02:25:16.508 region:rollup2
IN THE CSU AND OFFERING THEM THE

02:25:14.673 --> 02:25:17.142 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR

02:25:16.508 --> 02:25:24.349 region:rollup2
YEAR DEGREES THAT THEY DESERVE.

02:25:17.142 --> 02:25:26.851 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:29.254 region:rollup2
I'M CECIL CANTON.

JERRY MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE

02:25:29.888 --> 02:25:35.527 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:37.195 region:rollup2
.

02:25:35.527 --> 02:25:39.064 region:rollup2
WE ARE WELL ONE MAIN COLLEGE

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:40.765 region:rollup2
GRADUATES SHORT.

02:25:39.064 --> 02:25:44.002 region:rollup2
COMMITTED DEMANDS OF OUR OF OUR

02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:46.004 region:rollup2
STATE HAS STATE'S ECONOMY.

02:25:44.002 --> 02:25:49.240 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ISSUE IN LARGE PART

02:25:46.004 --> 02:25:50.375 region:rollup2
DUE TO. NOT CHEST GRADUATION.

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:52.677 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO ACCESS

02:25:50.375 --> 02:25:55.614 region:rollup2
WHO THE STUDENTS.

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:56.615 region:rollup2
IN OUR WHITE PAPER.

02:25:55.614 --> 02:25:58.316 region:rollup2
HARD TO SEE IF A WHITE PAPER

02:25:56.615 --> 02:25:59.951 region:rollup2
ECKLEY INTERRUPTED.

02:25:58.316 --> 02:26:01.820 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:02.954 region:rollup2
A FAR MORE DIVERSE.

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:04.689 region:rollup2
A STUDENT BODY THAT WE HAVE

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:05.256 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS AGO.

02:26:04.689 --> 02:26:07.359 region:rollup2
IN FACT IN THE PAPER WE SAY

02:26:05.256 --> 02:26:10.428 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:26:07.359 --> 02:26:12.597 region:rollup2
AS THE STUDENT BODY GOT DARKEN.

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:13.598 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING GOT LIGHTER.

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:15.433 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE GOT

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:16.434 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH.

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:17.936 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT WE TURNED AWAY

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:20.171 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR FROM THIRTY ONE

02:26:17.936 --> 02:26:21.806 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM THE CSU.

02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:23.675 region:rollup2
I AM WE BEEN TURNING AWAY SIX TO

02:26:21.806 --> 02:26:24.275 region:rollup2
SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS EVERY

02:26:23.675 --> 02:26:25.510 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:25.677 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:28.146 region:rollup2
THE.

02:26:25.677 --> 02:26:29.948 region:rollup2
.

02:26:28.146 --> 02:26:32.417 region:rollup2
MANY WHO WERE TURNED AWAY.

02:26:29.948 --> 02:26:33.385 region:rollup2
WERE UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS.

02:26:32.417 --> 02:26:34.753 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACT

02:26:33.385 --> 02:26:37.155 region:rollup2
THAT THESE ARE FOLKS WHO NEED

02:26:34.753 --> 02:26:37.856 region:rollup2
CHANCES.

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:40.892 region:rollup2
TO GET INTO.

02:26:37.856 --> 02:26:42.227 region:rollup2
ODD THE ECONOMY FAITH THEY

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:44.396 region:rollup2
DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

02:26:42.227 --> 02:26:45.497 region:rollup2
EDUCATED.

02:26:44.396 --> 02:26:47.032 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNDER

02:26:45.497 --> 02:26:48.533 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE CSU WITH A NINETY

02:26:47.032 --> 02:26:50.101 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION A BALLOT OUT A

02:26:48.533 --> 02:26:52.437 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:53.204 region:rollup2
WHILE THAT WHILE THE CSU BRICK

02:26:52.437 --> 02:26:55.674 region:rollup2
REQUESTED TWENTY SIXTY THREE

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:58.510 region:rollup2
MILLION AND OUR ORGANIZATION AS

02:26:55.674 --> 02:26:59.110 region:rollup2
IT WAS AS WAS MENTIONED. RIP ARE

02:26:58.510 --> 02:27:00.745 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED FOR TO TWENTY TWO

02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:01.746 region:rollup2
MILLION.

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:02.947 region:rollup2
IF THE STATE REALLY WANTS TO

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:05.350 region:rollup2
PREPARE.

02:27:02.947 --> 02:27:06.718 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT DOWNTURN.

02:27:05.350 --> 02:27:09.220 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD DO SO BY INVESTING IN

02:27:06.718 --> 02:27:10.889 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION.

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:13.091 region:rollup2
AND IT SHOULD DO THAT BY ALSO

02:27:10.889 --> 02:27:15.060 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING A LONG TERM

02:27:13.091 --> 02:27:15.627 region:rollup2
DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE.

02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:17.162 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE USED FOR HIGHER

02:27:15.627 --> 02:27:17.996 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

02:27:17.162 --> 02:27:19.731 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T DO THAT WE'RE GOING

02:27:17.996 --> 02:27:21.466 region:rollup2
TO BE DOING AS AS A MR MEDINA

02:27:19.731 --> 02:27:23.234 region:rollup2
HAS SAID.

02:27:21.466 --> 02:27:24.602 region:rollup2
WITH THE THREE AND FOUR PERCENT.

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:25.837 region:rollup2
AND NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE

NEW FUNDING FORMULA WOULD AFFECT

02:33:00.705 --> 02:33:04.342 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET OF CAMINO COLLEGES

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:05.777 region:rollup2
BEFORE CAME TO A BUDGET BILL.

02:33:04.342 --> 02:33:07.512 region:rollup2
NOT IN THIS CASE.

02:33:05.777 --> 02:33:08.946 region:rollup2
NOW THEY'RE HAVING A TASK FORCE

02:33:07.512 --> 02:33:11.783 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN

02:33:08.946 --> 02:33:13.451 region:rollup2
FIT THIS OF THIS FUNDING FORMULA

02:33:11.783 --> 02:33:15.486 region:rollup2
WITH JUST THE CEOS.

02:33:13.451 --> 02:33:17.055 region:rollup2
OKAY NO CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS

02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:18.756 region:rollup2
NO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GROUPS

02:33:17.055 --> 02:33:20.224 region:rollup2
NO ACADEMIC SENATE NO OTHER

02:33:18.756 --> 02:33:21.993 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WERE ALL SHUT OUT

02:33:20.224 --> 02:33:23.761 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY

02:33:21.993 --> 02:33:26.931 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT YOU DO THIS

02:33:23.761 --> 02:33:28.266 region:rollup2
TYPE OF KEY BUDGETING ITEM.

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:29.067 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WITHIN A THREE MONTH

02:33:28.266 --> 02:33:30.101 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND YOU'RE GONNA GET

02:33:29.067 --> 02:33:31.502 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT RISK GOING TO

02:33:30.101 --> 02:33:33.404 region:rollup2
REALLY TRULY WORK THE WAY YOU

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.971 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO. I DON'T THINK THIS

02:33:33.404 --> 02:33:34.839 region:rollup2
IS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BE

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:36.207 region:rollup2
DONE.

02:33:34.839 --> 02:33:37.575 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING WOULD BE I IN

02:33:36.207 --> 02:33:39.544 region:rollup2
TERMS OF I THINK MR MEDINA YOU

02:33:37.575 --> 02:33:41.179 region:rollup2

COURSES.

02:33:49.821 --> 02:33:51.656 region:rollup2

OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS ARE JUST

02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:44.482 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNDER

FUNDED MANDATES FOR ENROLLMENT

02:38:44.482 --> 02:38:47.518 region:rollup2
GROWTH ACROSS THE SYSTEM BUT A

02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:49.420 region:rollup2
FAR MORE SERIOUS AND DIRE ONE IS

02:38:47.518 --> 02:38:50.755 region:rollup2
A SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE HOUSING.

02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:52.156 region:rollup2

UNFUNDED ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS

02:39:15.546 --> 02:39:17.715 region:rollup2

03:10:04.593 --> 03:10:07.830 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGES STUDENT SUCCESS SO WE

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:09.665 region:rollup2
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK

03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:13.402 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHANGING SOME OF THE

03:10:09.665 --> 03:10:14.703 region:rollup2
pSOME OF THOSE FUNDING FORMULAS

03:10:13.402 --> 03:10:16.005 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AND CHOOSE TO

03:10:14.703 --> 03:10:17.439 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE

03:10:16.005 --> 03:10:18.807 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF COMPLEXITIES THAT

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:21.477 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOW REALIZING WITHIN THE

03:10:18.807 --> 03:10:22.544 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE TIED. ON THE LC FF.

03:10:21.477 --> 03:10:23.812 region:rollup2
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK

03:10:22.544 --> 03:10:26.148 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION.

03:10:23.812 --> 03:10:28.217 region:rollup2
IS THE CURRENT UP POSE WILL

03:10:26.148 --> 03:10:30.052 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

03:10:28.217 --> 03:10:31.287 region:rollup2
ASSUME THE INCREASE COSTIKYAN

03:10:30.052 --> 03:10:33.222 region:rollup2
COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO

03:10:31.287 --> 03:10:35.791 region:rollup2
BE FACING IN THE FUTURE IS THAT

03:10:33.222 --> 03:10:37.793 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE. NOT JUST MINIMAL

03:10:35.791 --> 03:10:39.328 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE AND IS THAT GOING TO

03:10:37.793 --> 03:10:40.829 region:rollup2
ENABLE COMMUNICATE USED TO BE

03:10:39.328 --> 03:10:42.298 region:rollup2
TRULY SUCCESSFUL YOU'VE ALREADY

03:10:40.829 --> 03:10:43.799 region:rollup2
HEARD A NUMBER OF ISSUES

03:10:42.298 --> 03:10:45.668 region:rollup2
REGARDING ONLINE.

03:10:43.799 --> 03:10:46.535 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I WOULD KNOW IS HOW WE

03:10:45.668 --> 03:10:48.170 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

03:10:46.535 --> 03:10:49.605 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT FINDING THE

03:10:48.170 --> 03:10:51.006 region:rollup2
BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS

03:10:49.605 --> 03:10:52.408 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S LAID OUT.

03:10:51.006 --> 03:10:53.909 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH

03:10:52.408 --> 03:10:55.978 region:rollup2
SOME CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHEN

03:10:53.909 --> 03:10:57.813 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO PROP NINETY EIGHT.

03:10:55.978 --> 03:10:59.448 region:rollup2
AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE

03:10:57.813 --> 03:11:01.283 region:rollup2
ARE CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS

03:10:59.448 --> 03:11:03.185 region:rollup2
WITH A STRUCTURED PROPOSAL FOR

03:11:01.283 --> 03:11:05.654 region:rollup2
HOW THAT SYSTEMS INITIALLY SET

03:11:03.185 --> 03:11:07.323 region:rollup2
UP WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR

03:11:05.654 --> 03:11:08.991 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS

03:11:07.323 --> 03:11:10.526 region:rollup2
IMPERATIVE MEETING COMFORT IS

03:11:08.991 --> 03:11:12.127 region:rollup2
NOT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND WE

03:11:10.526 --> 03:11:13.996 region:rollup2
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD

03:11:12.127 --> 03:11:16.198 region:rollup2
WITH. DISCUSSIONS UNLESS WE

03:11:13.996 --> 03:11:18.600 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

03:11:16.198 --> 03:11:19.902 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO LEVER ORGAN TO BE ABLE

03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:21.170 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FACULTY

03:11:19.902 --> 03:11:23.906 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE PROPERLY

03:11:21.170 --> 03:11:26.375 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED. THE ONLINE PROPOSAL

03:11:23.906 --> 03:11:27.876 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON

03:11:26.375 --> 03:11:29.545 region:rollup2
PART TIME TOO MANY COLLEGE

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:31.180 region:rollup2
FACULTY AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

03:11:29.545 --> 03:11:33.048 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY PART TIME

03:11:31.180 --> 03:11:35.551 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGE FACULTY DO NOT

ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO OFFICE

DISPROPORTIONATELY MAY NEED EVEN

03:11:45.928 --> 03:11:50.866 region:rollup2
MORE SUPPORT FROM THE FACULTY.

03:12:00.309 --> 03:12:01.744 region:rollup2
STRUCTURAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO

03:12:00.943 --> 03:12:03.412 region:rollup2
