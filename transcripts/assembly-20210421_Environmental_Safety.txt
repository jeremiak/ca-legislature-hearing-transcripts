BY COINCIDENCE MISTER BLOOM IS ALSO HERE TO PRESENT A BILL. AND I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE HERE SO PLEASE MISTER BLOOM IT'S TIME. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR FRESHWATER SITES ARE SAFE FOR RECREATION PLEASE WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS. YEAH YEAH REAL LIFE AND HAVING A DAY AND A DAY OR NIGHT BEING HERE I'D LIKE TO THAT YOU'RE NUMBER YOUR ABILITY AND BEEN WORKING MY OFFICE FARM. TO BE PUBLICLY SHARED UNLIKE COASTAL WATERS CALIFORNIA'S RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS ARE NOT MONITORED FOR RECREATIONAL WATER QUALITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS OCEAN BEACHES IN ADDITION THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA AND MONITORING THAT IS DONE IS MOST OFTEN NOT CURRENT OR READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS NOT BEING ROUTINELY MONITORED. THOUSANDS OF VISITORS TO FRESH WATER RECREATION. SITES MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTAMINATED WATER WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF ITS CONTAMINATION THIS WAS THE SITUATION THAT EXISTED AND CALIFORNIA BEACHES FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL WE BEGAN TESTING OF AND MUCH IN THE WAY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE. RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO A TO ESTABLISH AN STATUTE WHICH SITES NEED TO BE TESTED AB TEN SIXTY SIX REQUIRES THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY MONITORING COUNCIL. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC TO PROPOSE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD A DEFINITION OF A MONITORED FRESH WATER RECREATION SITE ORDER BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AB TEN SIXTY SIX IS MODELED AFTER AB FOUR ONE ONE WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW WAY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS FIRST REGULAR STATE AND LOCAL MONITORING OF COASTAL WATERS. AND INFORM THE PUBLIC WHEN THE WATERS POSED A HEALTH HAZARD. THIS IS NOT A COSTLY NEW STATE PROGRAM- IT WHAT IT DOES IS BUILT ON WORK THAT'S ALREADY BE DONE BEING DONE BY THE US W. R. C. B. AND MANY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR FRESH WATER RECREATION SITE MANAGERS. BY IMPROVING GREATER CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY TO FRESH WATER IN WATER QUALITY TESTING. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT TESTING PROTOCOLS AND METHODOLOGIES WE WANT TO CORRECT THAT. AB TEN SIXTY SIX FIXES KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS HEALTH PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING UNIFORM MONITORING STANDARDS WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING AN EQUITY ISSUE. INLAND AREAS SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS AS COASTAL AREAS. NOT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE LUXURY OF LIVING BY OR EVEN VISITING THE COAST AND MANY OF THOSE RESIDENTS RELY ON FRESH WATER BODIES LIKE LAKES RIVERS AND STREAMS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT AB TEN SIXTY SIX US- THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. AND IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. MY STAFF AND I AS WELL AS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL THE WATER BOARD AND PRIVATE OWNER OPERATORS TO ENSURE THIS LEGISLATION IS BOTH FAIR AND EFFECTIVE. AB TEN SIXTY SIX WILL ADDRESS A KEY PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE AN OUTDOOR RECREATION ENSURING THERE ARE SCIENCE AND HEALTH BASED BACTERIAL STANDARDS ONGOING WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION FOR FRESH WATER RECREATION. WHERE NEEDED. CALIFORNIA OF COURSE IS A MAGNIFICENT STATE AND ONE THAT AFFORDS ALL OUR COMMUNITIES WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO RECREATION OUTDOORS WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL ALL OF US FOR THAT. THOSE THAT ENJOY OUR LAKES RIVERS AND STREAMS DESERVE THE SAME ASSURANCES THAT THE FRESHWATER SITES ARE SAFE TO SWIM AND JUST AS THOSE WHO ENJOY OUR COASTAL BEACHES. CALLING IN TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE DOCTOR SURE SHELLEY LOOSE PRESIDENT AND CEO FEEL THE BAG AND ANALLY SIMO OF OUR WATER LA COALITION- AGAIN YOUR FIRST DAY OF THE HEAD OF HIM TODAY YES ACTUALLY LOOSE YES ALL RIGHT- SHELTON SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOUR MINUTES TOTAL OF TESTIMONY TWO MINUTES EACH SHORT DIVIDED UP ANOTHER WAY AND THEN- MICHELI LOOSE IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR SHELLEY LOOSE AND THEN PRESIDENT OF THE OF THE BANK AND WE ARE SPONSORING AB TEN SIXTY SIX WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR HEARING THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH US ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THEY LED THE EFFORT OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO TO GET BASIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS FOR OCEAN BEACH GOERS AND THANKS TO A BEFORE ELEVEN VISITORS TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED OF CALIFORNIA'S BELOVED BEACHES ARE BETTER PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE INFORMED. ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FECAL POLLUTION IN THE WATER WHICH COULD MAKE THEM SICK. INCREASED AND STANDARDIZED MONITORING AT OUR BEACHES HAS LED TO FURTHER LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR PROJECTS TO CLEAN UP THE WATER AT OUR BEACHES. AND FOR FURTHER PUBLIC EDUCATION AND TOGETHER THIS KEEPS PEOPLE SAFE- BUT TODAY PEOPLE STILL GET SICK FROM WATER CONTACTED BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY MONITORED FOR FECAL POLLUTION LIKE OUR BEACHES OUR- DATA FROM THE CDC AN ACADEMIC RESEARCHER SHOW US THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA DO GET SICK. FROM FRESHWATER RECREATION EVERY SUMMER. WHAT AB CAN SIXTIES PROPOSED. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID IS NOT BRAND NEW THE MAIN GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO PROVIDE VISITORS TO OUR FRESHWATER RECREATION AREA. WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE AND HEALTHY. THERE ARE ALREADY GROUPS AROUND THE STATE COLLECTING AND POSTING WATER QUALITY DATA. LOW SPORADICALLY AND NOT CONSISTENTLY THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THESE MONITORING EFFORTS AND MOST OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR MONITORING PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE NEED AND BETTER COORDINATION BETTER COVERAGE OF WHAT ABOUT A STATE WIDE AND STANDARDIZATION ACROSS OF MONITORING PROGRAMS. SOCIAL THE BAY WILL WORK WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM THE STATE WATER BOARD AND THE MONITORING COUNCIL TO ADDRESS REMAINING QUESTIONS RAISED IN BILL ANALYSIS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THAT THOUGHTFUL AND INSIGHTFUL ANALYSIS. TO ENSURE THAT WE END UP WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE BILL FOR AB TEN SIXTY SIX AT THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM. THE START THE NEXT STEP TOWARD PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM FECAL POLLUTION AT THEIR FAVORITE SWIMMING HOLE.

SHE PRESENT I JUST WANT TO ADD MY OVERALL CONCERN IS THAT TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY UP WITH THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS WE BELIEVE WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT THEY ARE NOT QUITE SO SURE- WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THAT AS WE GO FORWARD- BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE VERY CLOSE. SO PLEASE PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE. THOSE COMMENTS AND GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES- I WANT TO THINK- AS YOU MENTIONED MR CHAIRMAN I THINK- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF- THE CONSIDERATION THE WORK. THAT WENT INTO- THIS BILL AND WHERE IT'S AT NOW- AND I'M HERE TODAY PRESENTS IN THE BILL THREE SEVEN SEVENTY CALIFORNIA WATER ACT WHEN THE- ORIGINAL CLEAN WATER ACT PASSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. THE GOAL OF THE ACT WAS TO CLEAN UP OUR NATION'S WATERWAYS BY THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES- AND- I DIDN'T HAPPEN. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OVER 95% OF THE SAYS WATERWAYS ARE STILL IMPAIRED OR- POLLUTED ABOVE WHAT WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ALLOW. AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT WATER BOARD SURVEY PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND AS WE ALL KNOW CLEAN WATER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF A HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE SOCIETY- WE SWIM AND FISH IN THE WATERWAYS MANY OF THEM SUPPLIER DRINKING WATER AND ALL OF THEM SUPPORT OUR DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM HERE. IN THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND EVERY AREA OF OUR STATE DEALS WITH THE IMPACTS OF THESE POLLUTANTS IN OUR LOCAL WATERWAYS. EIGHT DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ARTICLE THE L. A. TIMES HIGHLIGHTED HOW THE LOS ANGELES AREA WON'T FULLY CLEAN UP STORMWATER POLLUTION. AND ACHIEVE IT'S- IT'S COLLECTIVE CLEAN WATER GOAL INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTIES. TWENTY EIGHTIES AND THAT'S THE BEST CASE SCENARIO. PART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY NOW FACE SOME OF THE HIGHEST WATER TREATMENT COSTS IN THE STATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO GET DRINKING WATER FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER WHICH HAS SOME POLLUTION WITH- TODAY JUST LEVELS OF MERCURY. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE TO GO TO NEARBY LAKES AND RESERVOIRS THAT HIT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE HAVE HAVE EVEN STRONGER US SOME POLLUTANTS OF MERCURY. THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY LACK ACCESS TO RELIABLE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IT IT'S A PROBLEM MADE WORSE BY THIS POLLUTION YEAH ON THE NORTH COAST TRIBAL CULTURAL PRACTICES ARE BEING WIPED OUT BECAUSE OF SEDIMENTATION IN STREAMS. HAS DESTROYED SALMON POPULATIONS. AND IN MY OWN COUNTY SAN BENITO. THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED MILES OF RIVERS AND STREAMS THAT ARE PAIRED WITH E. COLI PESTICIDES HEAVY METALS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS AND THIS IS JUST IN ONE SMALL SMALL COUNTY HERE IN OUR STATE. AND DESPITE THESE GRIM EXAMPLES WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS- AS A PROGRESS IMPROVING WATER QUALITY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT. FIFTY YEARS AGO- THERE WAS SO MUCH RAW SEWAGE IN THE SENATE IS KOBE. THAT IT LITERALLY STANK. AND NOW AFTER MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN TREATMENT PLANTS WATER QUALITY IS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED AND WHILE LIFE HAS RETURNED TO THE BAY. AND CLEARLY WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER FOR ALL IN THIS STATE. AND WE CAN DO IT WITHIN OUR LIFETIMES. IF WE ACT NOW. SO THIS BILL TE CALIFORNIA CLEAN WATER ACT AIMS TO CHEAPLY WATER IN OUR STATE BY TWENTY FIFTY. AND TO DO SO IT HAS THREE PARTS FIRST IT REQUIRES THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER BY TWENTY FIFTY- THIS PLANNING EXERCISE WILL ALLOW THEM TO USE. ALL TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO FIND THE BEST MOST COST EFFECTIVE PATHWAY TO ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER. AND SECOND IT REQUIRES THE WATER BOARDS TO FOCUS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. ON WORST VIOLATORS. IN THE MOST IMPAIRED WATERWAYS. ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK ON THE ENFORCEMENT FRONT. IT'LL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WATER BOARDS TO RECOVER THEIR ENFORCEMENT COSTS AS A NUMBER OF OTHER AGENCIES IN THE STATE ALREADY DO. AND SO THAT DISCHARGERS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW DON'T HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST. OF GOING AFTER BAD ACTORS. IT'S ALL FINALLY THIS LEGISLATION AB THREE SEVEN SEVEN WILL RE ALLOCATE SOME EXISTING MONEY AT THE WATER BOARD WITHOUT RAISING NEW REVENUES- TO PAY FOR REMEDIATION OF THE MOST IMPAIRED WATERWAYS HERE IN OUR STATE. AND AS HAVE AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT NOTICED THIS BILL HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD. I HAVE A HAND OUT THAT I HAD TO DO TO THE SECRETARY TO YELLOW PAGE- WHERE IT SHOWS ALL THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVE MADE AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE WE ARE COMPLETELY OPEN TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE ENGAGED STAKEHOLDERS- IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. EVERY STEP. OF THE WAY THE TO THIS COMMITTEE- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S WHERE THE OF OUR DEBATE. WE SHOULD. ALL COME TO THE NEGOTIATION TABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN FINALLY CLEAN UP OUR WATERWAYS WHEN WE READ IN THE L. A. TIMES AT. SOME POLLUTION DUE TO STORMWATER WILL BE CLEANED UP AND TOP POSSIBLY TWENTY EIGHTY. UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO THERE'S MANY THINGS WE HAVE DONE IT YOU KNOW- THAT WE'VE REMOVED A PROHIBITION ON THE WATER BOARD'S DEEMING IN COMPLIANCE ENTITIES THAT ARE. NOT ACTUALLY IN COMPLIANCE. WE REMOVE LIMITS ON THE TOOLS AND TIME FRAMES OF DISCHARGES CAN USE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WE'VE NARROWED THE BILL DOWN- IN FACT TO ITS CORE OBJECTIVE TO ELIMINATE THE WORST POLLUTION SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER STATEWIDE BY TWENTY FIFTY. THE ORIGINAL CLEAN WATER ACT FELL SHORT BECAUSE IT WAS A PRACTICAL. OUR BUILT MUST BE PRACTICAL AND MUST BE ACHIEVABLE. I MUST BE EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S A BALANCE I KNOW WE CAN STRIKE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED BOTH A COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS OF THIS BILL AND A GENUINE WILLINGNESS TO SEEK OUT INPUT AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO GET US THERE. THE NEED TO CLEAN UP OUR WATERWAYS IS ABSOLUTELY URGENT- SO MANY OF- ARE A OUR DISTRICTS AND- REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE COUNTING ON US- TO FIND A WAY TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND TO GET THIS DONE. AS A WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY ARE SHAUNA BOTHWELL OBJECTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE. AND CATHERINE A PIECE WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND POLICY HILL THE BAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR AGAIN FOR WORKING WITH US TONIGHT YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS PEOPLE I KNOW SO THANK YOU AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. SO WE HAVE TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT TESTIFYING ON THE PHONE LINE. FIRST MATH MISTER SHAWN. BOTHWELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA COAST COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE- PLEASE PROCEED- WHEN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH OR FOUR MINUTES TOTAL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR COWORKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHEN SOME OF ALL ON THE EXECUTIVE THE COMPANY CONSTITUENTS- I'M GONNA GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION ALREADY DISCUSSED ON THIS BILL- WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION AND ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THE BROWN'S AMENDMENTS. ARE TO CLARIFY THE BILL MAKE THE BILL MORE WORKABLE AND TO REMOVE REASONABLE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE HEART OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL FOUR TO CREATE SOME SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FROM POLLUTERS AND THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THE OPPOSITION IS NOT WILLING TO SUPPORT. NEXT YEAR THE FIFTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT AT THROUGHOUT THAT TIME DISCHARGES HAVE BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED CAN MEET WATER QUALITY LINENS. DISCHARGING POLLUTION FOR ONE REGION'S A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT. BUT A PRIVILEGE COMES WITH LIMITS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DISCHARGE POLLUTION YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE PERMITTED WATER QUALITY LIMITS WITHIN YOUR OWN PURPOSE. RATHER THAN TAKE THEIR ENERGY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW DISORDERS IS SPENT DECADES ROBBING THE WATER BOARD'S TO SHIELD THEM FROM COMPLIANCE. LOWER STANDARDS AND EXTEND COMPLIANCE DENMARK. AND MOST TROUBLING OF ALL ARE THE WATER BOARD'S BEAMING POLLUTERS IN COMPLIANCE WHEN THEY ARE ACTUALLY IN COMPLIANCE AND IT WON'T BE FOR DECADES. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE WATER BOARDS DO NOT ENFORCE WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS. WATER BOARDS WILL ENFORCE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES LIKE NOT SUBMITTING A REPORT ON TIME. FOLLOWING TO ENFORCE WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS ESTATE PLUS PERFORMANCE REPORT THE WATERBOARDING BENEFIBER THREE THOUSAND STORMWATER VIOLATIONS. IN JUST THE VIOLATIONS IDENTIFIED ONLY SIXTEEN OF THEM WERE ENFORCED UPON. THAT IS LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT OF THE TIME THE WATER BOARD'S PURSUED- ENFORCEMENT. ACTION FOR WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS. WHAT IS NOW IN HOLD POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MEETING THEIR- WATER QUALITY STAY. USING THEIR NEW INCOME POINTS WITHIN OUR LIFE. SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE. THE BILL NOT TAKE AWAY THE WATERBOARDING HIS. IN ONLY SIX WATER BY BE. OVER A- ONES THE BILL LONGER CONTAIN MANDATE TO RESTORE OUR WATER BUT FIFTY ONLY A- FOR STORMS. I WENT TO THE BILL SO IN FOR POINT BACK TO CAN YOU. THAT WAS HARMED THE VIOLATION THE WAY THE ORIGINAL FORM OF INTENDED TO FUNCTION. THE CURRENT VERSION OF A THREE SOME SEVEN IS NOT ISN'T. OVERHAUL OF REGULAR SO. THE WAY AUTOMATION OPPOSITION LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE BUT IT A STEP TOWARDS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POLLUTERS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. BUT I AFTER I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU- SO MR BOSCO A USED TWO MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS SO. UP MISS PIECE ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY. UP TRYING TO KEEP IT TO A MINUTE THIRTY IF YOU GOT IT TOO I WON'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH BUT- TRYING TO KEEP IT BRIEF THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CARE CORK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR KATHERINE PEASE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND POLICY AND HEAL THE BAY. I AM SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN. AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WILL PUT CALIFORNIA BACK ON TRACK TO MEET WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES BY TWENTY FIFTY. AS INTENDED IN THE CLEAN WATER ACT. WITH THE IMPACTS OF WATER QUALITY IMPAIRMENTS AND LACK OF PROGRESS FIRSTHAND IN LOS ANGELES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN HEAL THE BAY PUBLISHED A COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER REPORT EXAMINING PROGRESS OR LACK THEREOF IN STORMWATER POLLUTION REDUCTION EFFORTS AND L. A. COUNTY. WE REVIEWED DATA FROM TWELVE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT GROUPS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING STORM WATER PROJECTS. DESPITE OUR REGION HAVING HAD NEARLY THIRTY YEARS TO ADDRESS STORMWATER POLLUTION AND SIXTY YEARS TO EXECUTE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE PLAN WE FOUND THAT AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE RESPONSIBLE GROUPS THAT WE LOOKED AT ARE ONLY ABOUT 9% COMPLETE TOWARDS FINAL GOLD. IF THE CURRENT RATE OF IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUES. LOS ANGELES COUNTY GROUPS WILL ACHIEVE THEIR TOTAL COLLECTIVE GOAL IN TWENTY EIGHTY TWO WELL PAST THAT FINAL DEADLINES RANGING FROM. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN. MEANWHILE OUR WATER WAYS AND COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING. THE L. A. RIVER IS OFFICIALLY LISTED AS IMPAIRED FOR AT LEAST TWENTY DIFFERENT COLOR. THE RIVER FLOWS YOUR SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT CITIES INCLUDING MANY AREAS AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST POLLUTION BURDENS ACCORDING TO CALLAN VIRUS SCREEN. THE PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO STAYS CLEAN WATER. WE CANNOT CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL AND AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WILL RESET THIS IS MOTOR DIRECTORY THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ON. WE ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY. OUR WATER WAYS AND COMMUNITY AND GET US BACK ON TRACK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE NEXT PERSON TO SPEAK IS TERESA DUNHAM. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL AND CALIFORNIA COTTON GROWERS ASSOCIATION PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AT THREE THE DOWN ON THE CONCERT IN CONWAY YEAH MY TESTIMONY TODAY IS NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED BY MISTER CORK BUT ALSO OTHER INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO OUR STATE AND FEDERAL WATER QUALITY LAWS. WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS REGULATE DISCHARGES FROM AGRICULTURE AND OTHERS THISBILL CALLS FOR A PLAN FOR BRINGING ALL WATER SEGMENTS INTO A PAYMENT BY TWENTY FIFTEEN. ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE GOAL OF THIS PLAN WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPRACTICAL TO PREPARE FOR MANY REASONS FOR EXAMPLE WATER SEGMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT JUST RIVERS AND CREEKS BUT ALSO INCLUDE AGRICULTURAL. DRAINS HM BY FOR FLOOD. AND CAN BE TO SELL. MORE% IMPORTANTLY BRINGING WATERS TO INTO IT. PRISON SEVERAL KEY ON. ONE THAT ONE QUALITY ARE. WHICH THEY ARE NOT. THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE TO DO TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WHICH WE DOUBT. AND THAT WE- HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO IMPLEMENT EVEN IF WE KNEW WHAT TO DO WHICH WE DON'T. REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS THEY GO WELL BEYOND JUST ENFORCING CORRECT AND THAT. THE TERMINOLOGY OF CULTURE CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE STUDENTS OF A WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IS NOT SIMPLE TO INTERPRET. OR APPLY TO MANY TYPE DISCHARGES. AGRICULTURE AND STORMWATER AMONG OTHERS. WE DO NOT HAVE MATHIS TO MEASURE. OR DETERMINE CULTURE CONTRIBUTE. I WILL CULTURE JUST LIKE ME THAT GO WE NEED TOMORROW WHAT LEAVING SEVEN MILLION. IRRIGATED ACRES ALONG. LAND AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD. AND AN EXPENSIVE AND IMPOSSIBLE ENDEAVOR. WHAT IT MEAN DURING THE LIABLE UNDER THIS. I DON'T THINK IT AND APOSS OF COLOGNE AFFECTED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER DAY AND FOR AN IN PDF HOLDER TEN THOUSAND PER DAY. UNDER THE LEGISLATION DALY. WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL A DESTRUCTIVE COULD PROVE THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER CAUSING A CONTRIBUTING TO AN ACCIDENT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT DEMONSTRATION APPROVED WOULD ENTAIL.

THE POLLUTED WATER- BUT- YEAH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS DIED SO I THINK THAT MY CONCERN- AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE AMENDMENTS- HAVE A ADDRESSED A LOT OF THEM AND SO. I MAY JUST NEED TO. YOU KNOW GET TO. MANY OF MY CITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TO FULLY ANALYZE AND APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS- BUT- YEAH THAT THAT'S MY BASIC CONCERN THAT- I KNOW I JUST KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW EVER SINCE I'VE- ARRIVED IN THE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN IN TWENTY TWELVE- THAT- OFF ALL OF MY CITIES HAVE- YOU KNOW EMPHASIZED LIKE HOW THEY'RE- AT RISK OF BEING BANKRUPT- WITH THE- M. S. FOUR IN THE- OTHER OBLIGATIONS. AND SO. YEAH YOU KNOW I YOUR YOUR BILL YOUR AMENDED BILL MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ADDRESSED MANY OF THESE ISSUES- THE COULD YOU TALK ABOUT. IF YOU WERE TALKING TO MY CITIES- ON HOW THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO- INCREASE LIABILITY REMOVE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS YOU KNOW- DECREASE LOCAL RESOURCES TO- TO FIND STORMWATER- AND LESS FUNDING OVERALL FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT. IMAGE BASICALLY THOSE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE STORM WATER ASSOCIATION SURE WELL I APPRECIATE- THE COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE MINUTES WE HAVE MADE WE'VE DONE SO. PROACTIVELY AS I MENTIONED BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WE'VE- WE'VE ASKED- ALL OPPOSITION TO PROVIDE. US WITH LANGUAGE AND AMENDMENTS THA WOULD ALLEVIATE THEIR CONCERNS. AND THEY'RE NOT DONE SO AND SO WE TOOK THE INITIATIVE WORKING WITH- COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. TO ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS AS BEST WE CAN AND IN THIS IS SOMETHING WE YOU KNOW THIS IS A DISCUSSION THIS IS WORK THAT WILL CONTINUE YEAH WE WANT TO EAT IT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENGAGE THEM- THE YOUNG CERTAINLY JUST WHAT WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT THE CONCERNS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW THE WHOLE GOAL AROUND- AND FORESEEN- YOU KNOW BY ENFORCEMENT AS IT SUGGESTS IN THIS BILL. IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS IS A FORM OF BOUNTY HUNTING I'M GOING TO GO AFTER THESE. THESE AFFORDABLE DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW AND SO AND FORCING OUR LAWS HERE IN THE STATE CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY AND- A FAIR ON. A PLAYING FIELD- IT'S- CERTAINLY THAT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE GOOD ACTORS- THE SMALLER DISTRICTS THAT PLAY BY THE RULES- IN THAT HAVE ALREADY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN MEETING. WATER QUALITY STANDARDS- YOU KNOW IN IN THEIR EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW THE ONE EXAMPLE YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- I WOULD RELATE TO IS YOU KNOW WE DON'T SET SPEEDING LIMITS. AND THEN NOT GIVE OUT SPEEDING TICKETS NOW AND IT YOU KNOW SO WHY SHOULD WE SET WATER QUALITY LIMITS AND THE NOT HOLD BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE- AND SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW TO SPECIFICALLY ANSWER QUESTION I'D PROBABLY TURN IT OVER TO. THE TO- ONE OF THE SPONSORS- MR- MISTER BOTHWELL- SEAN- WHOSE- WITH THE- THE CUSTOMER ALLIANCES WORKS VERY CLOSELY. WITH A LOT OF THESE YOU KNOW LOCAL ENTITIES HI SEAN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YEAH I'M HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO ANSWER THE SPECIFIC QUESTION SO THE CONCERNED TEAM FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN IN LOS ANGELES SPECIFICALLY IS THEY HAVE THIS STORM WATER PERMIT WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED- BOB. DEANS CITIES AND COUNTIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR STANDARDS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SO LONG AGO AT THIS POINT FROM THE COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS I'M SO HAPPY AT THE OPENING ORIGINAL BILL HAD SUPERVISION UNIT. THAT HAD ONE THAT SAID WATER BOARDS YOU SHALL NOT BEING PEOPLE IN COMPLIANCE WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN COMPLIANCE BUT IT HAD A COMPLAINT SCHEDULED TO SAY YOU CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE UNTIL TWENTY THIRTY. AND THEN POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS TO TWENTY FORTY. THAT THOSE TWO PROVISIONS ARE THE HEART OF WHAT WAS THE CONCERN OF BOTH LOCAL CITIES AND RAISING THE ISSUES OF CAUCUS THAT THE THAT PART OF THE BILL HAD BEEN REMOVED. SO THAT IS NO LONGER CONCERNED CITIES AND COUNTIES THEY THEN SO CITY LOS ANGELES HOW THIS STATE HARBOR IN THEIR PERMITS- SO LONG AS THEY'RE MEETING THEIR PLAN- THEY CAN'T BE ENFORCED AGAIN SO THIS BILL ACTUALLY ONE IMPACTED THEM AT ALL BECAUSE THE SAFE HARBOR IS CURRENTLY SHIELDING THEMFROM ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. SO LONG AS THEY DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO ALL WITHIN THEIR PLAN THAT'S PART OF THEIR APARTMENT SO I DON'T SEE THE COSTA CITIES- OCCURRING ANYTIME SOON CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW AGAIN WHEN THE SAFE HARBOR SHIELDS GOES AWAY- AND THEY'RE STILL BAD ACTORS OUT THERE ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE WATER BOARD'S THE DISCUSSION. TO PRIORITIZE WATER QUALITY VIOLATIONS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE BILL CURRENTLY DOES WE WE'VE REMOVED REALLY THE HEART THAT SAID YOU CAN'T KEEP PEOPLE COMPLIANCE MEETING COMPLIANCE. WITHIN THE NEXT WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE. THROUGH THE CHAIR IT IF I MAY. ADDRESS THE QUESTION A FOLLOW QUESTION TO BE WITNESS. SO WHAT YOU MISTER WELL I KNOW THAT THOUGH IT WE TO- SO OPPORTUNITY TO. SPELL BOTH DIRECTLY AS WELL AS TO MY STAFF- MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT I KNOW A LOT OF MIGHT BITE MY CITIES- YOU KNOW AT. AS COASTAL CITIES YOU KNOW THEY THEY- ARE HAVE TOLD ME THAT- THEY ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY OF THE POLLUTANTS THAT COME DOWNSTREAM. FROM THE REST OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND SO THERE COULD THEIR CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS. BORNE THE BRUNT OF CLEANING UP THE MESS THAT COMES FROM THE REST OF L. A. COUNTY. I DON'T KNOW IF FOR. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA YOU KNOW CAN ENLIGHTEN US WITH HIS EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER MAYOR OF SANTA MONICA. BUT- YEAH SO I GUESS- YOU KNOW I AM CONCERNED THAT NOT WITHSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES CONTINUES TO BE IN OPPOSITION- AND- SO AGAIN I. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO BE WITH ALL MY FRIENDS THAT I SEE ON YOUR SUPPORT LIST- WANT TO BE WITH YOU MISTER REAVIS- BUT- YOU KNOW I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SUPPORT THIS WITHOUT FOR THE CLARIFICATION AS TO THE- THE COST- IMPLICATIONS FOR MY CITIES.

I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- SIMILAR MATHIS AND- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I NOT ONLY WILL BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WE'VE ENGAGED IN FROM DAY ONE- AND WE WILL CONTINUE ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS- THE COOPERATE- HE DID ACTUALLY ASK YOU A QUESTION LCR SIGN UP. ALL SET UP FOR MY CLOSING NEXT A MS BAUER QUE HAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO SAY MISS REAVIS- INTO THE COMMITTEE THAT IT'S CLEAR INCREDIBLE WORK HAS GONE INTO. MAKING THIS BILL WORKABLE AND I WANNA CREDIT BOTH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND YOU FOR DOING THAT WORK SO FAR WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIGURE OU HOW TO GET THERE. I THINK AT THIS POINT THE BILL IS PRETTY SIMPLE RIGHT IT'S ASKING US TO DO WHAT WE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO DO TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER TO CALIFORNIA AND THE FACT OR FAILING TO DO THAT TODAY. IS FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT IN YOUR PUSHING THE GOVERNMENT TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO ALREADY BE. FEELS LIKE A NO BRAINER TO ME AND SO I DO. AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT FEASIBLE AND YOU'VE ALREADY DONE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF THAT WORK AND I TRUST YOU TO CONTINUE TO DO IT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING US THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MS GARCIA. I WANT TO SPEAK A- HAD SOME OF MY LOCAL. CITY SPEAK UP AND OPPOSITION AND I KNOW AND THE ROUND OF AMENDMENTS GROUNDWATER. IS NOT INCLUDED AND- IN THIS BILL WHICH IS. OUR MAIN SOURCE OF CONCERN AND- MY DISTRICT I HAVE. A LOT OF CONTAMINATION DOWN THERE AND SO I APPRECIATE. WHERE THIS BILL IS GOING- IT'S BEEN. DONE QUITE. A BIT AND- I WISH IT WASN'T- AND HONESTY AND SAID JUST WANNA. I WANNA ENCOURAGE THE OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE TABLE AND WORK IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER. PROVIDING SAFE. WATER FOR. CALIFORNIANS TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WORK TOWARDS AND- IT'S TOO HARD TO DO WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IN A CERTAIN WAY IS NOT. IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON NOT TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING AND SO. MY MESSAGE IS FOR THE FOR THE OPPOSITION TO. COME TO THE TABLE AND WORK WITH US THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD- I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE WITH QUESTIONS. ARM SO FIRST DON'T ASK FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER REAVIS YOU MAY CLOSE ORGAN- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND- THIS COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR AND YOU KNOW AS I WAS MENTIONING TO SOMEONE MATHIS YOU KNOW I WILL. WE'LL CONTINUE MYSELF MY STAFF- WILL CONTINUE ENGAGE OPPOSITION ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURE AS WE HAVE- BUT AS WAS STATED BY- OUR COLLEAGUE YOU KNOW THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE I HEARD THE COMMENTS. OVER REACHING AND- I TO A DRACONIAN BILL IN NATURE I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THE LACK OF PROGRESS- THAT THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE MADE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER. DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN RECREATIONAL WATERS IN THE STATE. THE POLLING- WHEN I HEAR THINGS LIKE OVERREACH AND DRACONIAN WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND REMEDIATE THESE ISSUES AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF ALL OF THESE. ENTITIES THAT HAVE CALLED IN- THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THESE THESE THESE GOVERNMENTS LOCAL AGENCIES WITH REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT POWERS- WHO ARE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING. OR UNABLE TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT POLLUTION CONTROLS OF PERMITS- AND PARTICULARLY IN OUR STATES LESS A FLUENT INLAND AREAS ARE MOST IMPOVERISHED REGIONS. AND AND IT'S A SHAME. AND I YOU KNOW RESPECT THEIR OPPOSITION BUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO ENGAGE IN OFFER- RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE TO GET US INTO A BUT WE ALL PLACE TO. TO MAKE THE CHANGES IMPROVEMENTS WE NEED- IS A PROBLEM YOU KNOW BUT I CERTAINLY RESPECT ALL OF THE COMMENTS AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OPPOSITION ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO GET US IN A PLACE WHERE THIS IS AGAIN. A WORKABLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER. ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S FACE IT THIS IS A- THE REASON THE REASON LANGUAGE TO CURE THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT LANGUAGE WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS THE JYJ COST THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO MEET THE SENATE AND I CAN GO INTO SOME OF THE CONCERNS ON THE LANGUAGE WHICH- I WANT AT THIS TIME BUT- IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE MONEY IF WE'RE GOING TO TREAT. ALL OF OUR- STORM RUNOFF. AS WELL TO TREATED IN AS N THE WAY THAT WE TREAT OUR SEWAGE WHICH IS AT SOME POINT WHAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY IT'S REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE AND WHEN I WAS ON A WHICH CITY COUNCIL I WAS TOLD THOSE ISUNFUNDED MANDATE COMING AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO FORWARD IT. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER- I DO KNOW THAT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW WE ARE PUTTING. ALSO OF IT WE HAD A HURT HEARING EARLIER WE'RE PUTTING ALL SORTS OF PLASTIC IN TE WATER IN THIS PREDOMINANTLY COMING FROM STORM RUNOFF. IT'S PROBABLY PLASTIC FROM. DRYERS THAT- PUT- PLASTIC OUT INTO THE AIR AND THEY'RE EXHAUSTED- LATER. ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT FRANKLY WON'T BE SOLVED WITH RECYCLING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT'S THE WAY WERE LIVING. SO I DON'T THINK THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THAT OTHER THAN TREATING THE STORM WATER BUT IT'S HELLO EXTENSIVE. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO START BEING REALISTIC WHICH IS IF WE REALLY WANT THE CLEAN WATER WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN THAT'LL INCLUDE FINDING- AND THAT COULD BE. PROBABLY A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. SO IT'S NOT SMALL AND THAT'S JUST TALKING ABOUT CITIES AND SEWAGE AGENCIES BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS BALLOT IT'S A GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO GET THERE. I HAVE ALSO AND SO I HAVE CONCERNS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION AT THE STATE LEVEL PER A THE FOR. LEVEL A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS JUST AREN'T GOING TO HAVE THE MONEY AND SOME OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS MIGHT BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT ON THE- AGRICULTURAL SIDE WHAT ONE OF THE OPPOSITION LEADER SAID WAS. UP WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WELL WE'D BETTER FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. OUR WATER IS PRECIOUS. AND WE'RE LOSING SPECIES EVERY YEAR THIS IS THE TIME OF THE ANTHROPOCENE THE TIME WHEN MAN IS THE MAJOR. IMPACTOR ON OUR GEOLOGY. WHAT ARE CLIMATE. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THE FRESH WATER THAT WE NEED SO MUCH. THE BOUNTY OF THE SEA. AND IF WE DON'T PLAN IT'S GOING TO GO ON IT SEEMS LOTS A MASS EXTINCTIONS DO WE WANT TO BE THE CAUSE OF ANOTHER ONE AND PERHAPS EVEN OF OUR OWN. WE DON'T DO SOMETHING THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO THIS. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH AND- A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO INCLUDE WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM. AND HOW DO WE GET A HOLD OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE. WE ALREADY KNOW FROM- PROBLEMS OF THE GROUND WATER WHAT EXCESS NITROGEN. FERTILIZER TED. WE'VE GOT TO FIND THESE PROBLEMS AND SOLVE THEM OR- IS HE SAID THE PLAN IT WILL GO ON FINE BUT WE WON'T. AND THAT'S MY CONCLUSION AND WHY I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE CERTAINLY WORK AT STAKEHOLDERS BUT THIS IS- I CAN TELL YOU EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND- WILL WE WILL WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AND DO WITH THE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS PRO AND CON AND WE WILL TRY AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND WE WILL WORK AT THIS. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS UNTIL THE PROBLEM SOLVED SO I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ROBERT RIVAS THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK HIGH COURT HI SMITH NO SMITH NO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA THANKS FOR TAKING ON A VERY COMPLICATED YET VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT WE'VE CHATTED. MY MAIN CONCERN WITH THAT IS YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I JUST DIDN'T THINK THE WAS STRONG ENOUGH AND I KNOW NOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME- WAYS TO MAKE THAT STRONGER SO I WILL BE RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE- AND AS YOU GIVE YOUR INTRODUCTION- PLEASE TALK TO- WHAT ADDITIONAL- OUR- TO MANAGE YOUR BILL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AND WHICH WILL WORK WITH YOU ON- TO. BASICALLY FORCES SOLUTION TO A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THAT AND INTRODUCTION A DIFFICULT PROBLEM BUT I JUST SAID EARLIER THAT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP US FROM TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND SELL ONE I THINK THE CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND ALSO FOR IDENTIFYING THE COMPLEX ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT LAY AHEAD OF US AS AS WE DO THIS WORK I'M COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED INCLUDING WORKING WITH THE WATER BOARD ON HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT REGIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR ADDRESSING SAFE DRINKING WATER. IN SOUTHERN L. A. COUNTY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REGIONAL PLAN FOR CONSOLIDATION OF FAILING SMALL WATER AGENCIES WHERE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR SUSTAINABLE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND OUR REGION. COLLABORATION WITH REGIONAL WATER LEADERS TO IDENTIFY MEMBERS OF THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY BOARD. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WOULD BRING STATE WATER BOARD ATTENTION TO ONE OF THE STATE'S REGIONAL HOTSPOTS ARE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE PROBLEMS. PROVIDING OUR COMMUNITIES WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER. REQUIRES THE BOARD TO CREATE A PETITION TITLED COMMISSIONER FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY COUNTY REGION. THE COMMISSION A RELIEF REGIONAL COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR SUSTAINABLE DRINKING WATER WHICH MADE INCLUDES CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL AGENCIES. THE COMMISSIONER WILL ALSO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FUNDING AND LEAD EFFORTS TO FIX PROBLEMS WITH CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER. FINALLY THE COMMISSIONER WILL EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT WHERE PASSED THE AUDITS EVERY BILL PROBLEMS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE WHAT THE WATER BOND WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR ATTENTION ON FIXING WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DIFFICULTY PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS. ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER STEMMING L. A. COUNTY AND I WOULD SAY THAT SIMONELLI COUNTY IS OFTENTIMES THE SOUTHEAST L. A. COUNTY WHICH IS THE REACH AND THE SPEAKER AND I. COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT. I THE STATE WATERS WERE THREE SENATE STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT SAFE DRINKING WATER IDENTIFIED L. A. COUNTY F. AMONG THE TOP FIVE COUNTIES WITH SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AT RISK OF FAILURE EVERYTHING YOU SEE OTHER REPORT HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FAILING OR ON THE VERGE OF FAILING ARE CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHERN L. A. COUNTY AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE CONNECTING SOURCES FROM THE WATER FOR DIRECTLY TO SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE FORMATION OF TECHNICAL ADVISORY BOARD THE BOARD WILL INCLUDE WATER EXPERTS ON THE REGION QUALIFY TO DEVELOP AND OFFER SOLUTIONS TO THE WATER COMMISSIONER. THEY SAID IN A NEWS. IN TO ASSIST IS VERY TRICKY AND I WILL CONTINUE TO INVITE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MEET WITH THE CENTER TO IMPROVE. THE BILL AB ELEVEN ANY FIVE TO STARTING A LINE TO FIX WATER IN A WATER IN MY REGION THIS BILL CONNECT FEET RESOURCES TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. TO ASSIST IN REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE. FOR TOO LONG SYSTEMIC RACISM HAS AFFECTED BROWN IN BLACK COMMUNITIES. STATIONARY POLLUTING MACHINES HAVE BEEN ANCHORED IN COMMUNITIES THAT LOOK LIKE MINE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE BECAUSE OF. HOW WELL I THINK I WANNA SEE I DO WANT TO ADDRESS PART OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. BUT IF THE QUESTION WHY SO THEN L. A. COUNTY SHOULD GET A SPECIAL ATTENTION. I CRAVE THEM TO LOOK AT THE REPORTS FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD AND UCLA THE REGION APPROACH MAY BE A GOOD MODEL FOR OTHER PROBLEM REGIONS. SO WE MAY AMEND THE BILL TO OPERATE AFTER MODEL OR A PILOT PROJECT TO SHOW IT WORKS. EARLIER THIS WEEK A STATE WATER BOARD MEMBER TOLD A CONFERENCE AT A REGIONAL APPROACH MAY BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. FOR THOSE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PERHAPS PRIVATE PROHIBITION ON OPERATORSHIP IN WATER RIGHTS AND THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. I WOULD REMIND THEM THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ON OUR STATE WATER AND THEIR RIGHTS TO USE THAT WATER REMAINS SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATIONS. THAT FIND THEIR WAY TO WORK TO MAKE US WORK WITHINREGULATORY STRUCTURES TO PREVENT OWNERS MUST ALLEN ARE ABANDONING FILL WATER SYSTEMS. TO THE STATE WHILE KEEPING THIS IS THE MOST VALUABLE ASSETS. UP RESPECTFULLY ASK MY NAVEL. I'M JUST TO CLARIFY THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING. IS THAT YOU WOULD FIRST ASK THE LOCAL AGENCIES- INCLUDING. THE GROUND WATER AUTHORITY TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO GIVE. FOUR DOUBLE CLEAN DRINKABLE WATER AND GIVE THEM A TIME SPAN WHICH WE CAN TALK ABOUT IF THEY CAN'T DO THAT THEN WE WOULD ASK THE WATER BOARD TO TAKE A STRONGER HANDEDNESS CORRECT OKAY. SO THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT WE NEED WELL WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER RIGHT NOW- WE'LL TALK ABOUT- THE US SUPPORT FOR THIS ADAN ORTEGA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MY NAME IS OF AN ORTEGA- I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S WORK ON EIGHT ELEVEN NINETY FIVE BRINGS US FOR FULL CIRCLE TO PROPOSITION FIFTY A WATER BOND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THAT WAS THE FIRST TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR HELPING SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. PROP FIFTY INCLUDED SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP SMALL WATER SYSTEM NEED THINK CALIFORNIA NEEDS THAT IN PART WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE STUDY OF SOUTHEAST L. A. I HELP TO CONDUCT THAT WESTERN CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT WHEN I SERVED THERE IS ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER. NEEDLESS TO SAY A FEW OF THE DOLLARS FROM PROP FIFTY MADE IT TO SOUTHEAST L. A. IN THE YEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AFFECTING REGIONAL WATER AGENCIES. THAT IN THAT AREA THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AND SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON HAVE ALSO TRIED TO ADDRESS THE PAST YEARS. JUST AS THE SAME PER PROGRAM IS CREATING EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS TO HELP UNDER PERFORMING WATER SYSTEMS MOSTLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND CENTRAL COAST. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WOULD CREATE MECHANISMS TO HELP SMALL URBAN WATER SYSTEMS TO THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER COLLABORATIVE. UNLIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN AREAS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW HAVE REGIONAL WATER AGENCIES POSITION TO HELP SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE- COULD CREATE A TEMPLATE FOR REMOVING OBSTACLES AND DELAYS THESE REGIONAL AGENCIES FACE. AND HELP BETTER LEVERAGE THEY DOLLARS THIS WAS FIRST ENVISIONED IN AB ONE THIRTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND FAILURE TO ENACT THAT MEASURED LED TO A COMPLETION OF A PRIMER THAT WERE JUST PUBLISHING OBSTACLE FACED BY LARGER WATER SYSTEMS- THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO HELP SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AROUND THE STATE. PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE US PICTURES HI MY WILL NOT HELP FIND THEM BUT THEY ARE PROVIDED IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND IN THE PRIMER THAT I ATTACHED TO THAT TESTIMONY. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVES- HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER CONSORTIUM COULD BE A SUCCESSFUL FOLLOW UP TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIKE GIPSON AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. THAT HELP TO DISSOLVE THE CITY HE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AND HELP LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS ADMINISTRATOR TO FORMULATE A LONG TERM PLAN TO HELP THE TEAM IS RESIDENTS ATTAIN GOOD WATER QUALITY SERVICE AT A REASONABLE COST. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THAT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER COLLABORATIVE'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE LEVERAGE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM CITY VIA. AND INCLUDE TECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE ENTITIES THAT ENCOMPASS THE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES NEEDED IN CASES LIKE TO KEEP A AS WELL AS IN HELPING LESS SEVERELY IMPAIRED. WATER SYSTEMS. THE TECH OKAY PATH TO THE- THROUGH THE AB. ELEVEN NINETY FIVE CO. DESIGN THE SETS FINANCING NEEDS AND DETERMINE THEIR MULTIPLE BENEFITS SUCH AS CONSERVATION FROM REPLACING LEAKY PIPES WILL HAVE BENEFITS THAT EXCEED THE SPAN OF SOUTHEAST L. A. IN MANY WAYS THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY CREATED FOR SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UNDER YOU. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE IN THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER COLLABORATIVE CAN HELP THE REGION CATCH UP TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN QUANTIFYING NEEDS MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE SAFER PROGRAM. THAT FEW WOULD DISPUTE WAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HAS MET WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN SOUTHEAST L. A. AND HIS PLEDGE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO CALIBRATE THE BILL TO PRESIDENT NEEDS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER ORTEGA- NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE FIRST IS ALEX ROWE HAAS ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT A PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING SIR I WORK IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALEX ROSS AND I AM GENERAL MANAGER OF THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE ON BEHALF OF THE TWENTY FOUR CITIES WATER DISTRICTS. MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES A NEARLY TWO MILLION RESIDENTS WITHIN OUR SERVICE AREA. I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYWOMAN GARCIA MISTER DON OR TAKE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN GROUND WATER QUALITY ISSUES IN OUR SERVICE AREA WE SHARE THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION. IN GENERAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR AS A METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MEMBER AGENCY WE DELIVER HIGH QUALITY CONTAMINANT FREE DRINKING WATER DIRECTLY TO OUR RETAIL WATER SYSTEMS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR COST. FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT. CENTRAL BETA DOES NOT PROVIDE GROUNDWATER TO OUR RETAIL WATER SYSTEMS AND DOES NOT HAVE GROUND WATER RIGHTS WHICH WE SELL RELEASED TO RETAIL WATER SYSTEMS. THEREFORE IT IS UNCLEAR WHY AS A WHOLESALE WATER UTILITY WE ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. OUR INCLUSION IN THE BILL CREATES CONFUSION ABOUT ITS INTENT IT DETRACTS FROM THE VERY REAL ISSUES OF GROUND WATER QUALITY AND THE ONGOING GROUNDWATER TREATMENT NEEDS OF OUR SERVICE AREA. MY PRIMARY PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES AND REGIONAL WATER SYSTEMS WITHIN THE CENTRAL BASED ON SERVICE AREA. OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE ON GROUND WATER RIGHTS. LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION. THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT WILL TO BE PASSED ONTO THE RATEPAYERS. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OVERSIGHT MODEL THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TRIED TO CITIES LIKE FLINT MICHIGAN WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS. THE CENTRAL BASIN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN OUR RETAIL WATER SYSTEMS DO NOT NEED TO COMMISSIONER TO OVERSEE OPERATIONS. NOR DO WE SEE HOW INEXPENSIVE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRUCT HER WILL SERVE AS A BENEFIT TO THE REPAIRS. THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS MADE BY THE AUTHOR AND MR TAGO ALREADY OSSIBLE WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OF THE REPAIRS OR. THE PASSAGE OF AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE. AS NOTED BY AUTHOR ARE MANY CHALLENGES FACING THE SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGION. BUT IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES WE NEED THE STATE TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY FROM PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DRINKING WATER. AND CREATE JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES. CENTRAL BASIN DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WILL MAKE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES AND FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD.

AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE CREATE A GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES FACILITATE WATER SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION WITHIN HE BOUNDARIES OF THE WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT. CALIFORNIA WATER IF THE PATIENT HAS FOR MEMBER COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE DRINKING WATER SERVICE IN THE AREA. THE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S WORK ON THAT ISSUE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT AT DIFFERENT SOLUTION IS NEEDED FOR SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND THE LOS ANGELES REGION. UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT CREATES A PREFERENCE. FOR A GOVERNMENT RUN WATER DOWN OVER ANY OTHER WATER SYSTEM CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT THE STATE SAID LOOK TO MAXIMIZE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITIES SUFFERING FROM CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER. HI RATE OR BOTH RATHER THAN CREATE ANY LIMITATIONS ACT CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE. THE NEW GOVERNMENT ENTITY CREATED FOR AB AND LEVIN NINETY FIVE. WHICH STATUTORILY. PROHIBITED FROM CONTEMPLATING A PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE OF CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION MEMBERS. EVEN IF THAT WATER SUPPLIER CAN OFFER REASONABLE RATES AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY. COMMUNITIES IN LOS ANGELES AND SAFE DRINKING WATER DESERVE TO HAVE EVERY OPTION ON THE TABLE. WE JOINED TODAY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND WE OFFER AN AMENDMENT IN OUR LETTER TO ALLOW ANY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS.

AND I AM VERY PLEASED THAT MY STAFF PARTICULARLY PAGE BROKAW- I COMMITTEE STAFFER. HAS TAKEN AND STARTED TALKING TO THESE GROUPS TO TRY AND COME UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE. WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. AGAIN IT COMES DOWN TO DOLLARS. CAN WE CAN UP. WITH A BETTER SYSTEM- AND KEEP IT DIDN'T APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL LEVEL. WE'RE STARTING THIS BY SAYING ALL RIGHT WHAT IS THE IDEAL PROGRAM WHAT WOULD YOU REALLY NEED TO DO. AND THEY WERE GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COST OF THAT PROGRAM ARE. AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT VARIOUS OPTIONS AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE AND THAT WILL WORK. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. SO IT IS WORK IN PROGRESS. AND WE SHALL- BUT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. FROM THE. FOR MY WITNESSES. AND LOOKS LIKE I DON'T HAVE A LIST OF WHO THE WITNESSES ARE BUT I COULD PROBABLY DO ON THEM YES WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF TESTIFYING ON THE PHONE LINE IN THE PHONE MODERATOR CAN YOU CALL A J. SINCE SHE TOMORROW- WE HAVE A NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. IT IS A THREE YEAR OLD YOUR LINE SIR. BOHAT THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBER- SMELTER HERE. WHICH SHALL EUREKA REGIONAL LAYING- BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ACTION COUNCIL IN THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL FOR PLEASED TO BE WORKING WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK- ON EIGHTY SEVEN OH SEVEN WHICH WERE FORMED CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM TO COLLECT AND RECYCLE MERCURY THERMOSTATS. MY CLIENTS IN THE TRC THE THERMOSTAT RECYCLING CORPORATION MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO WHY THE CURRENT PRODUCER RUN PROGRAMS FAILED TO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS BUT WE ARE HERE TO LITIGATE THE PAST. AND WE'RE HERE TO FIND SOLUTIONS MAKE THE PROGRAM WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE PLEASED TO BE WORKING WITH FAMILY MEMBER COWORKER- ON THE BILL AND WE HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY THE BILL WILL BE IN A FORM THAT WE CAN PROBABLY SUPPORT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. LOOKING AHEAD JUST VERY QUICKLY NOTING THE MOTION AND A SECOND- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL HAS A FEW QUALITY BENCHMARKS IN THE FUTURE ONE EIGHTY SEVEN OH SEVEN SHOULD CONTINUE TO REFLECT. THE PRINCIPLES OF PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY I JUST I SHOULD IMPROVE FREE AND CONVENIENT DROP OFF OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNERS CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS YOU NEED TO RETURN A THERMOSTAT. IT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED SUFFICIENTLY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SENSE THE IDEA HERE IS TO HAND OFF THE PROGRAM TO DO NOT THE MANUFACTURERS- WITH THE KIND OF A CERTAIN FUNDING LEVEL. IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THIS NEW ENTITY COLLECTION MORE THERMOSTATS THEN WERE- BUDGETED FOR THE FUNDING NEEDS TO COME THROUGH TO APPROPRIATELY PROCESS RECYCLE THOSE THERMOSTATS SO WE'RE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT A HARD CAP ON FUNDING AND THEN FINALLY PUBLIC AT G. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH MUST BE IMPROVED SO PEOPLE KNOW. WHERE TO DROP- THE THERMOSTAT SO AGAIN THANK YOU TO MR QUIRK I AND HIS STAFF WE AGREE- THE PROCESS IS BANNED- QUITE HELPFUL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS AND WE ARE DR- TODAY SO THESE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS CAN CONTINUE THANK YOU.

AND MOST MANUFACTURERS SELLING THEM LONG BEFORE THE BAND SO I'M LIKE CARPET OR MATTRESS RECYCLING THE PROGRAM IS GOING AFTER AN EVER SHRINKING UNIVERSE OF REMAINING MERCURY THERMOSTATS. THIS MEANS THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE UPDATE THE PROGRAM THIS YEAR SO THAT WE CAN. WE CAN USE THE IMPROVED PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WHEN THE AST OF THE MERCURY THERMOSTATS ARE LIKELY TO BE REMOVED TO UPGRADES REMODELED AND DEMOLITION- IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN QUIRK AND HIS STAFF. FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION OF THE TRIP MISTER SMELSER AND MY FELLOW STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR COLLECTIVE WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND PERSPECTIVES AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO RETRACT THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THE STATE'S REMAINING MERCURY THERMOSTATS.

OKAY SO O'DONNELL ACTUALLY ASKED TO HAVE A BILL COME OFF CONSENT SO WE COULD PRESENT IT UP ALL THE ALL THE BETTER BE ENTERTAINING. THANK YOU MR HERE THIS IS JUST A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT I SEE SOME OTHER MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY ALL MEMBERS. WHO SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT DDT AND WHERE IT ENDS UP- MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO RESENT AJ ARE TOO WHICH CALLS UPON CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY SHOULD TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY. TO PREVENT A DDT DUMPING SITE AND MY DISTRICT NEAR CATALINA ISLAND FROM CAUSING FURTHER HARM TO OUR OCEANS AND CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. ONCE CHAMPIONS FOR ITS USE AS A PESTICIDE TODAY DDT IS RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE FIRST. MAJOR ECOLOGICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTERS IN THE HISTORY OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. AND A LOT OF YOUNGER FOLKS ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DTS I JUST KEEP IT SHORT AND SAY IT'S BAD IT'S BAD. WE'LL EXPOSE LONG TERM G. T. WILL OFTEN DEVELOP PERMANENT NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE AND IF PREGNANT. CAN HAVE AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF PREMATURE BIRTHS. AS FOR WILDLIFE THE EFFECTS OF DDT I BELIEVE TO HAVE LED TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF NUMERACY BIRDS FROM THE CHANNEL ISLANDS INCLUDING SPECIES OF GULLS PELICANS AND CORMORANTS. THIS IS A THIS IS TRULY DEVASTATING TO OUR FRAGILE OCEANIC ECOSYSTEMS AS DDT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE FROM THE FOOD CHAIN AS IT BUILDS UP AND THE FATTY TISSUES OF VARIOUS SPECIES. ALL THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN MADE EVEN WORSE BY THE CARELESSNESS OF THOSE ORIGINALLY TASKED WITH DISPOSING OF THESE HARMFUL CHEMICALS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SCIENTISTS FROM UC SANTA BARBARA'S BARBER BOB PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS FROM A MULTI YEAR EXAMINATION OF A SITE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR JUST NORTH OF CATALINA ISLAND. THEY DISCOVERED A LONG FORGOTTEN DUMPING GROUND FOR TOXICS WASTE PRODUCED AS A BY PRODUCT OF THE DDG MANUFACTURING PROCESS THROUGH THE USE OF UNDERWATER SUBMERSIBLES THE SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO PROVE. WHAT IT ONLY BEEN RUMORED BEFORE THAT THOUSANDS OF BARRELS FILLED WITH DDT LACED SLUDGE WERE BARGED OUT OVER THE OPEN OCEAN AND TOSSED INTO THE WATER JUST TOSS OFF A SHIP. IN SOME INSTANCES THE BERYL'S APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN FIRST STRUCK WITH AN AXE OR HAMMER. BY THOSE ORIGINALLY DISPOSING OF THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD SINK. TO THE OCEAN FLOOR. A PRACTICE THAT NEARLY GUARANTEED THEIR TOXIC CONTENTS WOULD SEEP OUT INTO THE SURROUNDING FRAGILE WATERS. SCIENTISTS ESTIMATE THAT MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TONS OF WASTE COULD HAVE GONE INTO THE WATERS AROUND CATALINA. IN ORDER TO BE PROPER STEWARDS OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES WE MUST WRESTLE WITH THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST AND ADDRESS THE DAMAGE BEFORE IT GETS WORSE. AG ARE TWO CALLS UPON OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO TALK. TO STOP THE HARM THIS SITE CONTINUES TO INFLICT ON CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENCE AND ARE FRAGILE WILDLIFE. WITH THAT BACK YOU MISTER CHAIR THERE MAYBE SOMEONE FROM CATALINA ISLAND ON THE PHONE I'M NOT SURE WE TRY TO GET THE MAYOR BUT THERE WAS. SOME TRANSPORTATION ISSUES WHEN YOU LIVE ON AN ISLAND THAT HAPPENS OKAY- SO YES. SOMEONE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ON THE LINE FROM THE CITY OF AVALON EITHER. MAYOR AND MARSHALL OR ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER. MICHAEL HARMER. IF EITHER ONE OF YOU IS ON THE LINE PLEASE COME ON IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IN THE MORNING MAKE FIVE CHAIR WORK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIKE PARMER AND I AM THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF APPLE ON. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TO. AVALON IS AN ISLAND COASTAL COMMUNITY LOCATED ON CATALINA ISLAND ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILES OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ONE IS A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT EIGHT SQUARE MILES IN SIZE AND HOME TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE YEAR ROUND WITH OVER ONE POINT ONE MILLION VISITORS PER YEAR. WITH OVER SIXTY TWO MILES OF UNDEVELOPED COASTLINE NINE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND POOR AREAS OF SPECIAL BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE THE ISLAND IS ALSO HOME TO MORE THAN SIXTY PLANT ANIMAL AND INSECT SPECIES FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. AS WELL AS MANY PROTECTED SPECIES MARINE LIFE THE CITY IN CATALINA ISLAND HAVE A VIBRANT TOURISM AND RECREATION BASED ECONOMY THAT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR OCEAN COURSE ICONOMI. AB ONE IN IRELAND ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PHILOSOPHY AND ERIC MISSION OF PROTECTING COASTAL RESOURCES AND YOU NEED STATE AND FEDERAL SAFEGUARDS THAT HELP PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT FROM POLLUTION AND PRESERVE WATER QUALITY. AS AN ISLAND PHYSICALLY ISOLATED FROM CALIFORNIA MAINLAND BY THE PACIFIC OCEAN WATER QUALITY IN OCEAN CONSERVATION IS CRITICAL TO THE PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF OUR COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THE REDISCOVERY OF THE DDT WASTE DUMPING SITE OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST IN THE ST PETER BASS AND POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO VIOLENCE MARINE LIFE. OUR RESIDENTS AND VISITORS HELP AND OUR FUTURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY WITH THE POLITICAL LOGICAL IMPACTS OF A MASSIVE DDT WASTE DUMPING SITE ARE STILL BEING ASSESSED CRITICAL STATE AND FEDERAL SUPPORT IS NEEDED TO CLEAN UP THE SITE. AB ONE STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE PROPOSED AJ ARE TOO AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR VULNERABLE NATURAL RESOURCES AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK. YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. VERY GOOD- IS THERE ANYONE- BEING THEIR PRIMARY SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION. IF SO- PLEASE- SAY SOMETHING TO THE OPERATOR.

IF I COULD BE A JOINT AUTHOR ON ON THIS RESOLUTION WITH YOU I MEAN THIS IS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THIS IS A- ONE OF THE BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES. THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A FRONT PAGE LA TIMES- ARTICLE AND A LOT OF THOSE DDT FILLED BARRELS WERE JUST DUMPED RIGHT OFF THE COAST OF MY DISTRICT OFFER THE PALACE VERDES PENINSULA AND- YOU KNOW I WENT AS FAR AS- ENQUIRING WITH THE- THE U. S. EPA WAS CENTER DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE AND OTHERS ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT DDT IS. IS POSING A HARM TO. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT GO TO THE BEACH. AND PALACE VERDES AND TORRANCE IN REDONDO. AND WHILE I'VE BEEN ASSURED THAT THAT IT- DOES NOT. THERE'S NOT BEEN. A HARMFUL LEVELS OF DDT- THE DETECTED- IN THE BEACH GOING AREAS- NONE THE LESS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH. YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BARRELS- JUST LYING ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. OFF THE COAST OF THE PALACE VERDES PENINSULA SO. YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE. OUGHT TO BE PROSECUTED THEY ARE THEY ARE TO BE- BROUGHT TO JUSTICE- YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE. THERE BEEN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS THAT- YEAH. MAYBE- PRESENT SOME ISSUES BUT- BUT AS FAR AS THIS RESOLUTION. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER ADDING ME AS A JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS. ABSOLUTELY MY TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM TORRANCE AND I KNOW YOU ARE IN THOSE WATERS OFTEN ON YOUR SURFBOARD. AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AN ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRAGEDY. THE RECOGNIZING THAT TODAY YEAH- SO- WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR YOU COULD TALK TO THE AUTHOR LATER AS TO BECOMING A JOINT AUTHORS- MISTER BLOOM. I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL- I THINK MISTER OF MURATSUCHI SENATE WELL THIS IS A- A CRIME OF THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF AND- I'M NOT CRITICIZING YOU MISTER JOHN ALL OF YOU- SAID I THINK HE IS THE WORD THAT THAT DATE BARRELS WERE DISPOSED CARELESSLY BOB THIS WASN'T A CARELESS ACT TO- IT IT WAS DONE PURPOSEFULLY IT WAS DONE- TO SAVE FUEL TO MAKE IT EASIER ON THE PEOPLE WHO WERE- SUPPOSED TO BE PROPERLY DISPOSING THESE AND- THERE. THERE MAY BE SETTLEMENTS IN PLACE. THE SETTLEMENTS ASSUMED PROPER DISPOSAL AND THIS WAS ANYTHING BUT SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT- OF THOSE ARE RESPONSIBLE OF WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DISPOSAL AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR A BRING IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT RESOLUTION THANK YOU MAYBE A BETTER WAY TO TERMINUS HEINOUS AND PURPOSEFUL. NOW YOU'RE ON. ALL RIGHT OTHER COMMENTS. THERE MIGHT BE NO OTHER WITNESSES AND NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE- YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS THAT'S WHEN I VOTE. ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE THING THAT MAKES DDT DIFFERENT. IS THAT IT STAYS SO LONG IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND BY THE WAY IT'S NOT THE ONLY AND WE'RE PRODUCING OTHER CHEMICALS WERE BEING MORE CAREFUL ABOUT OUR PESTICIDES- DDT WAS LOOKED AT AS BEING A MIRACLE. AND THEN. WE LOST NEARLY ALL THE BALD EAGLES ALL BALD EAGLES AND WE FOUND IT IS BECAUSE DDT PERSISTS IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S THE REAL THREAT HERE. YOU CAN WAIT DECADES AND IT'S STILL THERE FURTHER ABOUT THE ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW OR THAT HALF OF THE INSECT LIFE IN THE WORLD. HAS GONE AWAY- YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IF YOU WERE A CHILD AND YOU WERE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THAT THERE WOULD BE ALL SORTS OF INSECTS HITTING THE SHIELD THE SHIELD OF YOUR CAR HAPPENS TO MUCH LESS EXTENT NOW AND THE RESULT OF FEWER INSECTS AS FAR FEWER BIRDS.
