OKAY GO AHEAD JOBS SORRY ABOUT THAT TECHNO DIFFICULTIES ON OUR END SO WHEN YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN- NO PROBLEM WELL THANK YOU FOR- FOR HAVING ME COME IN HERE AND SPEAK- JUST- I'LL GIVE A LITTLE QUICK CONTACTS AND I KNOW YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME. OR AT LEAST- OUR TIME IS LIMITED SO I'M IN A KIND OF DEFER BACK TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS OF. THINGS THAT- I DON'T ANSWER. FIRST WE'VE IN THIRTEEN MONTHS WE'VE HAD FIVE SHOOTINGS HERE IN SAN SAN LUIS OBISPO. THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR US TO PRICKLY WERE HAVING A SHOOTING ABOUT EVERY THREE YEARS- OF THOSE FIVE SHOOTINGS- TWO WERE ACTIVE SHOOTERS- THE RESULTS OF THE SHOOTINGS WE HAD ONE OFFICER KILLED WE HAD TO BY DEPUTY SHOT. TWO POLICE OFFICERS WANTED TO CHP OFFICERS WOUNDED FIVE CIVILIANS KILLED AND ONE- ONE INNOCENT CIVILIANS MURDERED. SO I CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE TWO SHOOTINGS WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- ONE- AND VERY QUICKLY AND ONE TOOK ABOUT THIRTY SIX HOURS TO RESOLVE- THE FIRST ONE THE ONE THAT TOOK THE LONGEST TIME. BEGAN WITH THE SHOOTER- SHOOTING AT THE- PASTORALS POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING AT NIGHT THEY OBSERVED HIM COME UP TO THE DOOR ARMED- THROUGH CAMERAS. AND THEN- HAD NOT ONLY HE NOT ONLY BE GET SHOOTING AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT AROUND THE DOWNTOWN AREA SHOT OUT A- A FEMALE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA- EVENTUALLY MADE HIS WAY UP FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND SHOT A HOMELESS PERSON- NEAR THE RAILROAD STATION. AND THEN OUR OFFICER OUR DEPUTIES ARRIVED AND- HE AMBER STEM FROM THE DARK SHOT AT THEM CHANGE POSITIONS AROUND THE BUILDING AND THEN SHOT- ONE OF MY DEPUTIES THAT PRIVACY AND HAD. A FORTUNATELY NICK IS REVIVED- HIS PARTNER RETURNED FIRE- HE DISAPPEARED BACK IN THE NIGHT. OF HAD A OVER HIDING PLACE THE FOLLOWING FOLLOWING EVENING HE REEMERGED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVING A CALL OF SHOTS FIRED- HE AGAIN- ELUDED THEM INTO A RIVERBED THE SALINAS RIVERBED- RE EMERGED A COUPLE MILES DOWN THE ROAD AT CHEVRON. YEAH THEY RESPOND AGAIN HE SHOT. VENTRALLY HE HIT IN THE RIVER BAD- THE FOLLOWING DAY MEMBERS OF THE REGIONAL SWAT TEAM- CAME ACROSS HIM WELL THEY DIDN'T SEE HIM HE WAS HIDING. SHOT ONE OF THE REGIONAL SWAT TEAM MEMBERS IN THE LAG- EVENTUALLY LEADING TO- THAT AREA BEING SHUT DOWN HIM COMING OUT ARMED AND BEING SHOT. THE SECOND ONE WENT VERY QUICKLY- GUY TRAVELING FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA ARRIVED AT A GAS STATION IN APOLLO CALIFORNIA AND IN MY AREA. AND WENT TO THE DOOR TO USE THE BATHROOM HE WAS WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. AND THE BATHROOM- THEY HAD SIGNS ON IT SAYING. IT WAS CLOSED THIS ANGERED HIM HE WENT BACK TO HIS CAR- RETRIEVED THE GUN. GIRLFRIEND FLED THE CAR AT THAT POINT UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WAS HAVING A SOME FORM A PSYCHOTIC BREAK. HE WENT BACK TO THE OBSERVING CLARK SO I'M COMING BACK WITH A GUN IT THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS HE TRIED SHOOTING HIS WAY AND IT. DIDN'T WORK HE STEPPED OUT ONTO A BUSY ROADWAY- ABOUT TEN THIRTY TEN FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING BEGAN SHOOTING AT CARS- STARBUCKS CROSS STREET BUILDINGS. ARE AT END UP SHOOTING A CAL FIRE FIRE ENGINE RESPONDING TO A CALL- THREE ROUNDS INTO THE CALGARY UNFORTUNATELY MISSED. THE FIREFIGHTERS AND- MADE HIS WAY BACK AROUND THE BUILDING- THE DOOR HAD COME OPEN SOMEHOW A- INNOCENT BYSTANDER HAD GONE INTO THE BATHROOM OR INTO THE- BUILDING. HE SAW THEM WHEN IN. BY THE TIME HE WAS IN IS WHEN OUR FIRST UNITS ARRIVED OUTSIDE AND- HE- EVENTUALLY CAME OUT. AFTER DISCHARGING THE GUN INSIDE THE- BUSINESS WALKED OUT- REFUSED TO DROP THE GUN AND WAS SHOT AND KILLED- SO THAT ONE HAPPENED VERY VERY QUICKLY- IT BEGAN AND AT ABOUT- ONE TWENTY AND ENDED ABOUT ELEVEN MINUTES LATER. SO TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOOTINGS FOR US- AND BOTH HAD SIMILAR HISTORY AND WELL THE FIRST ONE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS- IT WAS. BUT HISTORY WITH THE SHOOTER- THE SECOND ONE- VERY SHORT HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS MATTER FACT NO CRIMINAL HISTORY NO PRIOR OF VANCE ACTUALLY TRY TO GO THROUGH POLICE ACADEMY WAS INJURED SO NO INDICATIONS THAT HE WAS ANTI LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND BUT HAD SOME FORM OF. A MENTAL HEALTH BREAKDOWN- IN A WEEK OR A COUPLE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE ABOUT. THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT OUR TRAINING WE'VE HAD A PRETTY ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAM AND AS YOU KNOW SINCE SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY NINE APRIL NINETY NINE WHEN THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING HAPPENED IT'S BEEN A PUSH FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT- SO WE HAVE HAD ONGOING- ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAINING FOR OUR EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO SOMETHING WE OFFER ALL THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS THE MAJORITY. GO THROUGH OUR TRAINING COURSE- WE OFFER- TRAINING AND AWARENESS FOR ANY BASICALLY ANY GROUP IN THE COMMUNITY- WE CAN GOVERNMENT WE DO PRIVATE BUSINESS- WE'VE DONE CHURCHES. WE HAVE A FULL PRESENTATION OF HOW TO PREPARE THEM FOR AN ACTIVE SHOOTER- WE HAVE A BIRCHER- USE OF FORCE TRAINING MACHINE THAT WE USE IN ADDITION FOR OUR- OUR DEPUTIES FOR TRAINING. WE PUT TOGETHER A PRETTY ROBUST. SCHOOL SHOOTING- PREPARATION. WE PURCHASED A AN APPLICATION CALLED- RAVE WHICH IS A BASICALLY AN EMERGENCY BUTTON- THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL STAFF ON EVERY SCHOOL- WE HAVE GONE THROUGH AND DIAGRAM TO- OVER A HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN OUR COMMUNITY- THAT ARE ALL. ON A MAPPING PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES POINTS OF ENTRY- AREAS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE ALTERNATIVE AREAS FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE BUILDING LOCATIONS DESCRIPTIONS ALL. THAT IS UPDATED ANNUALLY AND IT'S ALL A PROVIDED TO ALL THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND TO MY DEPUTIES ON THEIR MOBILE COMPUTERS IN THE CAR. SO WE- IN ADDITION TO YOUR AT YOUR YOUR YOUR NORMAL WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS ON PREPARING THEM WE ALSO SPEND A SIGNIFICANT OUT AMOUNT OF TIME- ANTICIPATING A POTENTIAL.ACTIVE SHOOTER TO SCHOOLS. SO WITH OUR ADVANCE WHAT WAS UNEXPECTED WELL THE FIRST ONE BEING THIRTY SIX HOURS I'M VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE AN EVENT GOING THAT LONG. THE AREA THAT IT OCCURRED IN IS VERY- ITS BORDER THE TAP BOARDING THE TOWN AND CAN BE VERY- REMOTE- EVEN THOUGH WE FLEW HELICOPTERS FOR ALMOST TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY A DAY- WITH- FULLER UNITS ON LOOKING FOR THE SUSPECT HE- ALLUDED BY BEING IN A STORM DRAIN- OVERNIGHT. BUT IT WAS A VERY DYNAMIC- A BAT WHICH REQUIRE NOT ONLY RESPONSE FROM. ALL OF OUR AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY INCLUDING MY SQUAT TEAM THE REGIONAL POLICE SWAT TEAM. BUT ALSO- SWAT TEAMS FROM KERN COUNTY IN KINGS COUNTY ALSO RESPONDED TO ASSIST IN DAY TO JUST PURELY BECAUSE OF FATIGUE AND ALSO THE F. B. I.'S ALEX WHAT TEAM. I WAS ON GROUNDS AS WELL. SO WHAT CHANGES HAVE WE MADE OR WHAT WERE WHAT WE IDENTIFIED REALLY- A FEW KEY AREAS THAT NEEDED- NEED WORK. NUMBER ONE SELF DEPLOYMENT WHICH SEEMS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN MOST MAJOR SHOOTINGS WHERE AGENCIES RESPOND THEN- AND YOU'RE UNAWARE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE SO COMMUNICATIONS BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM. WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES WE FOUND WE HAD TO HAVE LIISONS WITH EACH OF THOSE TEAMS- BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH US BUT HE MEDICATIONS IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND I THINK ALWAYS WILL BE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I SAW ONE WHERE IT COMES TO SELF DEPLOYMENT IS THAT. WE HAVE SO TRAINED WE'VE TRAINED FOR SO MANY YEARS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER- OUR RESPONSES BECOME- I GUESS VERY- VERY SAD AND THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT. WHEN A SECOND SHOOTING HAPPENED IN THE SECOND DAY- OFFICERS WERE COMING IN- FORMING TEAMS AND DEPLOYING INTO AN AREA THAT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF. OF COVER AND AYE CONCEALMENT FOR THE SHOOTER AND REALLY- LACK OF FAMILIARITY BY THE RESPONDING OFFICERS AND SO THEY WERE TREATING IT AS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN ESSENCE GOING INTO A BUILDING. WHEN IT WAS REALLY AND AT A POINT WHERE. IT NEEDED TO BE- THE PRIMER NEEDED RESET AND THEN A PLANNED RESPONSE WITH SWAT TEAMS SO ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE PEOPLE SOFT POINT INTO. THE HOT AREA- WITHOUT ANY. WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE OR GOT ANY- KNOWLEDGE. OF WHAT THEY'RE WALKING INTO- SO TRYING TO GET THAT MINDSET- TO YOU KNOW TO DON'T MOVE IN WITHOUT DIRECTION- REPORT AND COMMUNICATE WHO YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE- WAS PRETTY VITAL AND IN THE FIRST- SHOOTING. SO MOVING FORWARD WITH TRAINING AND WE FOUND THAT THE REGIONAL- SWAT TEAM- NEEDS MORE TRAINING IN AREAS OF LIKE OPEN AREAS SEARCHING STOP THAT OUR TEAM YOU KNOW TRAINS ON REGULARLY BECAUSE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT- AND THEN AND THEN CERTAINLY- RETRAINING OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. YEAH AND I KIND OF THE AREAS THAT I MENTIONED AND THE COMMUNICATION RESPONSE. THE ONE THING I DIDN'T MENTION IN TRAINING WE ALSO TRAIN WITH- ALL OF OUR OUR- FIREFIGHTERS- WE TRAIN THEM IN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN RESPONSE. ABOUT TEAMING UP WITH OUR PEOPLE IN RESPONSE- SO- THAT OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE. IN THE AREA OF A QUICK MINUTE- BECAUSE OF OUR SHOOTINGS- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OR EQUIPPING. OF ALL OF MY- MARCH UNITS AND ALL ALL OF OUR STATIONS WITH- PROTECTIVE SHIELDS- BECAUSE AND IN PARTICULAR ONE OF OUR SHOOTINGS THIS LAST YEAR IT WAS A REAL ISSUE FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT- LOOKING AT DEPLOYING- OR ARE MOVING FORWARD DEPLOYING- HIGHER CALIBER THREE OH EIGHT- A. R. PLATFORM RIFLES TO. A SELECTED TRAIN PERSONNEL BECAUSE IN THAT INSTANCE OF THE FIRST ONE- WE- WE FOUND THAT THAT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANY ANY WEAPON THAT WE HAVE. AND WAS EVENTUALLY- THE THING THAT ENDED IT. AND THEN OTHR MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT- EVEN KNOW WE HAVE REALLY FOUR ARMORED VEHICLES COUNTY WIDE- WHAT WE FOUND WAS IS THAT THE- THE YOU GO THROUGH THOSE VERY QUICKLY WHEN YOU HAVE A WIDE AREA SEARCH. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED WAS REGARDING ADVICE- AND I WOULD SAY FOR US IT WAS MAKE SURE YOU TRAINING WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES MAKE SURE YOU TRAIN ON A WHERE YOUR COMMUNICATION DEFICITS ARE. HOW DO YOU REPAIR THAT A SELF DEPLOYMENT- KIND OF BACK TO THE BASICS- RESPONDING INTO A HOT ZONE OR MAINTAINING A PERIMETER ALLOWING YOUR YOU KNOW TRAIN EXECUTION OF A PLANNED PARTICULARLY WHEN THE ACTIVE SHOOTER PORTION IS AND THERE IS NOBODY NOBODY IN JEOPARDY IT'S ONE THING RESPONDING TO A BUSINESS OR A SCHOOL AND SHOOTING IS STILL OCCURRING. S. SECOND RESPONDING TO AN OPEN AREA WHERE THE SUSPECT IS REALLY HIDING AND SO I THINK THOSE THINGS BECAUSE OF OUR ONGOING TRAINING IN THIS AREA HAVE AB SLIGHTLY GOTTEN LOST. AND THEN THE LAST THING WAS IS. WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE AGENCIES PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW WITH US WE HAVE SEVEN SMALLER POLICE DEPARTMENTS WHAT WHAT WHAT I FOUND IS THAT REALLY COMMANDED CONTROL- NEEDS TO GET TRANSFERRED TO THE AGENCY WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCE. IN THE AREA- AND THE ABILITY TO- PLAN AND DEPLOY UNITS- PROPERLY. STRIP PROBABLY WENT OVER MY TIME BUT- NOT YOUR FAULT YOU'RE FINE SURE OF OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO ON TO OUR NEXT- PANELISTS ON THE FIRST PANEL I BELIEVE ARE SOME OF THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE MONTH I THINK- ARE YOU ON THE LINE. THIS AREA. A CHAIR CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH I'M HERE I THINK SO OKAY CHIEF RUGGEDMAN READY CAN GUIDE.

WE ALL OF THE SHOTS WERE LAST HEARD SO THOSE TO CONTACT TEAMS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO OUT OF THAT BUILDING- TO WHERE THE SHOTS WERE WERE AND WHERE WE KNEW BASED ON INFORMATION- THE YEAR SUGAR WAS AT. OUR AS A RESULT OF- THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE- THE INDIVIDUAL KNEW THAT THE OFFICERS WERE WERE- WERE ON THEIR WAY. GIVEN THE- THE SEARCH OF THE BUILDING.

ARE DEPLOYED IN RESPONSE. I'VE THAT SCENE TO MAINTAIN THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO- TO RESPOND TO THAT INCIDENT AS WELL- YEAH WE ARE WE WEREN'T THE BEST A GATING. BY AGENCY- WHICH IS CURRENTLY A BIG INVESTIGATIVE BODY SANTA CLARA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. OR I'M SPEAKING TO HOW. HI IN RESPONSE THAT WE TOOK- AS- PART ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO. THE ASSAD'S ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENT- BACK IN MAY. I WANTED THINGS THAT- WAS I HEARD ABOUT IT SURE FIVE MENTIONED. ALSO WAS A SOME OF THE- CHARGES THAT WE FACED AN IMMEDIATE. UNIFIED COMMAND. WITH THAT MEANS IS WHEN WE ARRIVED TO A SCENE. AT THE STEP IS SEEN WE KNOW IT IT'S K. STILL HAS TO TAKE A CHARGE- FORTUNATELY OUR OFFICERS- RESPONDED. THAT RESPONDED WERE ABLE TO FORM THESE- CONTACT TEAMS AND IMMEDIATELY OR RESPOND. INSIDE THE BUILDING WHERE THE SUSPECT WAS HOWEVER WE ALSO REALIZE THAT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE- STRUCTURED- IN A WAY THAT. AS RESOURCES COMMAND BECAUSE IT'S QUITE SOUR OR DISTURBANCES ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE. WE LEARNED THAT UP I LIKE THE TRAINING THAT WE'VE HAD WE TO HAVE SOMEONE IN CHARGE IMMEDIATELY TO- MAINTAIN THAT UNIFIED COMMAND. CHIU US START DODD DEPLOYING RESOURCES- AS THE- TRAINING- WE'VE HAD A ALLOWS- SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT WE'VE DONE HERE AT THE ECLIPSE AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT. IS AS SINCE THAT TWO THOUSAND NINE. I PROVIDED ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAINING- NOT ONLY FOR OFFICERS- I DON'T KNOW WHAT BASIS ARE TOLD FROM NOW- BUT ALSO- HAD DEPLOYED AND BEGAN TRAINING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS SUCH. AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT- SO AS A- TWO THOUSAND NINETY. WE WERE OUT WORKING WITH AND TRAINING WITH. OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT STANDS APART APARTMENT. TO CREATE A TEAM THAT WILL GO IN. TO TRIAGE SO WE HAVE THE- REACTING THAT GOES IN AND ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF THE SHOOTER MCKINLEY. AND THEN SOON AFTER THAT THAT THE YOU KNOW. A RESCUE TASK FORCE TEAMS- WILL GO IN AS WELL A TOGETHER WITH FIRE CHIU- HELP BY ANY VICTIMS THAT ARE- IN THE IN THE AREA BECAUSEWE KNOW THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE- SO WE LEARN FROM- OTHER AGENCIES ARE. THROUGHOUT THE- NATION THAT THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE MEDICAL SAW SERVICE. TO US SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO DEPLOYED. DURING AT THE BEACH HE SHOULDN'T. AS A RESULT OF THE UP TRAINING THAT WE'VE- WE'VE DEVELOPED- SHEARER AND SETTLES A FOR OUR OUR LOCAL PARTNERS- SINCE THE COMMISSION SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. BEEN TRAINING AND ACTIVE SHOOTER SO SOME OF THE- TO MAKE IT AS REALISTIC AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE THE- THEY BARK- ACTOR SHOOTER TRAINING SCENARIO- HERE IN THE IN THIS AREA THE UP AREA RAPID TRANSIT- ALSO IT AT LARGE. TRANSPORTATION AGENCY HERE IN THE US AND I'LL BE HAPPY SAN JOSE. BACK IN THE- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAD A- LARGE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL TRAINING SCENARIOS- WE- PLAYED TO AN ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENT AT THAT FACILITY AGAIN TO SEE HOW OUR TRAINING ALIGNS WITH OTHER AGENCIES ARE RESPONDING TO THESE TYPE OF INCIDENTS AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT- WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED AND- CAN HELP LOAN OUR AGENCY BUT- THE- AVERY AGENCIES TO RESPOND. AFFORDABLE TO THIS TYPE OF TRAINING FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO. ONE OTHER THING- TRAINING THAT WE'VE DONE. BOB BAKKEN THAT TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. ONE IS A SEVERITY HERE JUST LOCALLY. AT A LOCAL MALL. WHERE WE TRAINED OUR SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND- SOME MEMBERS OF OUR- ACTUAL UNITS TO RESPOND TO AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT A MALL. SO WHAT WE'LL GET TO MAKE IT AS REALISTIC AS AS POSSIBLE WE- HAD- THE SCENARIO PLAYED OUT. AT THAT LOCATION. I WANTED THINGS THAT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO IS- TO HAVE MORE REALISTIC TRAINING. YES IT'S- YOU SEE TWO OF. ARE SIMPLE TO OUR CONDUCT TRAINING IN A CLASSROOM BUT THAT WE NEED TO- GO OUT IN THE FIELD. OF MUCH LIKE- IN THE PAST WE'VE DONE- SOME TRAININGS THAT- THE ESTATE HAS PUT ON- WITH- SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT- TO DO SO OUR OFFICERS ARE RESPOND BECAUSE IT IS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE. OUR LINE OFFICER FIRST BOMBS ARE GOING TO RESPOND. AND IT'S NOT UNTIL LATER THAT OUR- SPECIAL OPERATIONS WILL SHOW UP. BECAUSE OF THE IMMEDIACY OF THE- SITUATION SO. ANY TRAINING THAT THAT PROVIDES REALISTIC INFRASTRUCTURE SCENARIOS- WHAT WILL HELP THEM IN THAT TRAINING. AND ALSO BRING IN. AS A SHARE OF MENTIONS. OTHER JURISDICTIONS- TO THE TRAINING SO WE CAN WERE TOGETHER. I WANTED THINGS THAT WE FOUND- IN THE MBTA. SHOOTING IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A REGIONAL- RADIO SYSTEM- HOWEVER- GET WITHOUT HAVING TO UNIFIED COMMAND UP MAJORITY OF OUR RESOURCES WERE SAN JOSE RESPONDING AT THE TIME. AND THE OTHER JURISDICTION- HAD- THAT SWITCHED OVER TO THE- RADIO SYSTEM THAT WE WERE USING ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO IT WASN'T AFTER AND SO- ADDS UP A RESURGENT RESPONDED SO AGAIN HAVING THAT UNIFIED COMMAND. IMPORTANT TO DIRECT ALL THE INCOMING RESOURCES ARE COMING AND SO THAT WE'RE O THE SAME PAGE RIGHT HERE IN THE SAME MESSAGE. AND HAVING- THAT SAME- INFORMATION. OF FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN SAN JOSE. IS NOT ONLY TRAINING WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO TRAINING ARE. ORDER UP MEMBERS END UP IN COMPUTATIONS SO WE KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. HOW TO SWITCH OVER TO THOSE OUR RADIO SYSTEMS. I SAW THAT WERE ALL. ON THE SAME CHANNEL AND- UNDERSTANDING. OF INFORMATION THAT'S- THIS SPRING BEING BROADCASTED AND BE PROVIDED TO. THE FRONT LIFESTYLE OFFICER SO THAT WE'RE ABLE. TO RESPOND AND LOCATED AT THE INDIVIDUAL. I WANTED I KNOW THAT- WE ALSO WHILE WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IN SAN JOSE AS WE GO THROUGH THE TRAININGS- IT IS- WE TALKED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE KNOW THAT. THESE INCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN SAN JOSE IS CONTACTING US SOME OF THE- MAJOR- INFRASTRUCTURE SITES OF A MAJOR SITES- TO WORK WITH THEM AND TRAIN WITH THEM AS PART OF THESE. THESE ARE REALISTIC I TRAINING SCENARIOS. AND ALSO WHILE GETTING FEEDBACK FROM THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CAME UP WITH AND ARE WORKING TOWARDS. UP HOSPITALS IN THE MALLS. HOW MUCH LIKE OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS WHEN THE- ALL UP OR GOING TO A HUGE CONSTRUCTION. AND YOUR STRUCTURE THE- PROVIDE DIRECTION ON HOW TO ACCESS OTHER BARBECUED ACCESS- THESE UP THE STRUCTURE TO GET A STRUCTURE FIRE WELL I THINK WE NEED TO- WORK WITH. A MAJOR. BOB STRUCTURE- INFRASTRUCTURES HERE IN OUR CITIES- TO. OBTAIN THAT THAT SAME INFORMATION LIKE PLANS ON THE WAY OUT OF THESE- THESE BUILDINGS. ARE WHO HAS KEY CARD ACCESS WHERE WE GET KEYS. ARE TO HAVE ACCESS- SOMETHING THAT WE CALL THE- GO BACK SO. THOSE BAGS- WHERE. THE FIRST RESPONDERS CAN'T GO INTO A BUILDING SAY- A LARGE- TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER. SUCH AS CISCO OR EBAY HERE ARE LARGE HOSPITAL. AWARE FIRST RESPONDERS POLICE OFFICERS AND PACIFIC LEE. AND GO AND GET ALL THAT INFORMATION ON TO LAY OUT AND DIAGRAM. OF FIVE THIS THESE ARE STRUCTURE SO WE CAN BETTER ABLE MOVER- THROUGH THE SURFACE ELOISE WHEN WE HAVE THESE THAT TYPE OF UP INCIDENTS SO. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING OUT HERE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WAS MENTIONED BY BISHOP AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE NEEDS- I THINK THAT WILL HELP BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN IS- PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND TRAINING AT THE AT THE STATE LEVEL. AS WE CONTINUE- WITH THE SILO. WITH THIS TYPE OF TRAINING BECAUSE WE KNOW WE SEATED- NATIONWIDE- AT SCHOOLS- AND- HERE AT THE- AT SOME OF OUR UP MASS TRANSIT- AGENCIES BUT IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE SO WE NEED. TO HAVE MORE REALISTIC TRAINING- AND RESOURCES FOR OUR OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. PARTNERS WHAT IT IS I ALSO FORGOT DO YOU WANT TO MENTION IS- THIS IS SO. RESOURCE INTENSIVE SO WE DID THAT WORK WELL WITH- ARGUE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE FBI- WAS WAS- INSTRUMENTAL AND ATF- RESPONDING TO ASSIST HERE IT IS THAT WE HAVE HERE. IN SAN JOSE AS WELL AS SAID IN A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL THEY WERE OUT THEY ALSO RESPONDED- AND WE'RE PART OF THE JOB. BOB MACK TEAMS THAT WE HAD AND THEN ALSO WAS VERY- AND- FORM AND- INSISTED AS WELL AS THE COUNTY- YESTERDAY I WAS ON A SHERIFF PROPERTY- SEARCHERS SECTION AND THE UP. WHERE THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY IT ALSO RESPONDED WITH THEM- A GREAT PARTNER BARS WAS THE- CHECKER DISTRICT ATTORNEY. OF WHERE THEY OPENED A REUNIFICATION CENTER FOR THE FAMILIES AND ASSISTED- WITH- ON THE VICTIM'S FAMILIES- IF ANY RESOURCES AT THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO. PROVIDE THEM OUT OF THE INFORMATION AS IT WOULD IT BECAME AVAILABLE SO AGAIN BRINGING ALL THOSE RESOURCES TOGETHER ARE WORKING TOGETHER OUT ASSEMBLY TRAINING THAT WE'VE HAD- HELPED US. IN THIS AREA- I THINK THAT'S ALL- BY TO GET A MENTAL PROCESSES SHARP MENTIONED HAVING THAT COMMAND CONTROL WHICH IS PART OF THAT- YOU KNOW- BY COMMAND INITIALLY. REPORT OUT FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN THE THESE TYPE OF INCIDENTS OCCUR. WITH THAT OUT OF YOUR PROTECTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM FOR APPRECIATED- FUNDING WILL GO OUT TO OUR LAST PANELIST ON THIS FIRST PANEL OF THIS YEAR FROM ASSISTANT CHIEF ERIC SAILOR FROM SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT. CHIEF ARE YOU THERE. I AM THERE. MIGHT COME A LONG CLERK YES IN HERE. GOOD THIS CALL IS A FALSE ALARM YOU SHARE MY SCREEN I HAVE SOME PICTURES I CAN PUT UP THAT'LL BE MUCH MORE INTERESTING LOOK AT THEM IN OUR THANKS SO. YEAH I BELIEVE YOU CAN. SHE LOOKED. OKAY STILL RESULT IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE FIRE SERVICE AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION WILL SAY THAT SACRAMENTO CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT KIND OF WAKE UP CALL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN WE HAD A- A MASS STABBING AND FOR THE CAPITAL ON THE CAPITOL GROUNDS WE LOOK TO THE PHOTO TO LEFT- THAT'S OUR FIREFIGHTERS TREATING VICTIMS OF THE THREATS OWN- COVERED BY POLICE WE KNEW AT THAT POINT WE NEEDED TO CREATE A VISION WHERE WE DID BETTER AFTER THIS TYPE OF COORDINATED EVENT- WE JUST BACKED UP SERVICE OUR MISSION IS SIMPLE- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STOP THE KILLING AND WE NEED TO STOP THE DYING. THESE ARE TWO MISSIONS THAT RUN TOGETHER. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE. SO WE STARTED WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE THREAT STUDY IT IS A OVER TWO YEARS WE DID OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY DRILLS. IN REAL LIFE- OFFENSE WITH A REAL LIFE PEOPLE AND IN. PLACES LIKE NIGHTCLUBS IN BUILDINGS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO USE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. THE THREAT STUDY IS AN ACRONYM FROM THE HARTFORD CONSENSUS WHICH LISTS OUT THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH- IN ONE OF THESE EVENTS SO. D. AS WORDPRESS OPPRESSION OF ONE PORTIONS JOB H. IS FOR IMAGE CONTROL. R. S. RAPID EXTRICATION AND IN A IS FOR A STUDENT TEACHER TRIP TRANSPORTES OF THE BASIC OBJECTIVES YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH ONE OF THESE EVENTS. AND OUR GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP TACTICS THAT. THAT SO WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A TEAM OF MIXED OF ACADEMICS AND SPECIAL FORCES OPERATORS TO READ EVERY ACTION REPORT ALL THE ARTICLES WE FIND GUIDELINES SO WE CAN START TO ESTABLISH SOME BASIC TERMINOLOGY AND PUT TOGETHER A GOOD ACADEMIC STUDY WHERE WE ACTUALLY MEASURE THINGS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET IMPROVEMENTSONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DID AS WE STARTED OUTLINING SOME USEFUL TERMINOLOGY FOR US. LIKE MOST YEARS DICTION SACRAMENTO HAS A PRETTY GOOD MIX OF AGENCIES SO WE CAN HAVE YOU KNOW REAL QUICK INTERACTION WITH CHP SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT SECOND THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE WESPAC PD- DHS OFFICERS AND SECRET SERVICE IN THE DOWNTOWN CORE ANYTIME SO TWO LINEOUTS AND BASIC TERMINOLOGY THAT WAS USEFUL FOR US. THE FIRST THING THAT WE CAME ACROSS WAS THE- TERM SECURE WE FOUND THROUGH THESE DRILLS THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION BETWEEN. WHAT IT MEANT- WHAT WHAT A LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS TO GO INTO THREAT SOUNDS AND- SO WE'RE USING THE WORD SAVE SOME WHOSE NETWORK CLEARED- WE CAME TO THE TERM SECURE. AND WE JUST FOUND THIS TO RESEARCH SECURE FOR US MEANT THE ABILITY TO RETURN EFFECTIVE FIRE SO FROM THE FIREFIGHTERS PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THAT RUMORS OWN THAT IS ABLE TO RETURN BACK TO FIRE. THAT UP WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO GO AND IF THE THREAT HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED OUR JOB IS TO GET THE VICTIMS. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST THE CLOCK ON ALL THESE EVENTS SOUND THE GOALS TO GET ANY VICTIM TO THE HOSPITAL AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES. ON THE NEXT TERM THAT WE REALLY STRUGGLED OVER WAS DIFFERENCE WHEN VICTIMS IN PATIENTS. THESE EVENTS THE EVERYBODY IS A VICTIM- THEY CAN TRANSITION TO PATIENTS ONCE THEY GET OUT OF THE THREATS OWN. PATIENTS GET TREATED TRIAGED AND TRANSPORTED WHERE'S VICTIMS THEY GET RAPID BLEEDING CONTROL NEGATIVE TO THE EFFECTS ON ONCE WE ESTABLISH THAT TERMINOLOGY FOR THE FIRE SERVICE BECAME MUCH EASIER TO FOCUS ON OUR GOALS WHICH IS TO. GET THE VICTIM OUT OF THE THREATS OWN IMPROPER FOR TRANSPORT. WE KNOW THAT ROUGHLY IT OUT IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES SO THE GOAL TO GET TO THEM TO STOP THE BLEEDING AND MOVE INTO THE EFFECTS ON AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ZONE OF OPERATIONS WE- WE HAVE ALL BEEN OUR TERMINOLOGY. WE FOUND THAT- THE HOT AND COLD STONES WERE CONFUSING FOR BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE IN THE MEETING THAT. BOTH DIFFERENT AGENCIES HAVE DIFFERENT SETTINGS WITH A MUCH SO WE WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL TERMINOLOGY INTO TRIPLE C. TO TRIPLE C. IS TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE. THAT WAS A DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY THE MILITARY THAT BASICALLY OUTLINED A LOT OF OUR TACTICS NEWS EVENTS- THE RESULTS FROM KNOWLEDGE IS DIRECT THREAT INDIRECT THREAT AND HE BACKS DOWN. WE USE THOSE TERMS IT BECAME VERY CLEAR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE IN OUR TRAINING. WHAT THAT METRIC THREAD DRAWS LINE OF FIRE THAT'S NOT WERE ONE THOUSAND WERE FIRE GOES FAR IT IS GOING TRICK FOR OWNS. BUT THEY GO IN INDIRECT FOR ITS OWN. WITHIN GET THE VICTIMS THANK AT THE- AND VICTIMS OUT OF. AREA FAST. TO BACKS THEM LEAVE EGGS IS WHERE WE TO BRING A AMBULANCE. AND GET THOSE PATIENTS OR VICTIMS TO THE HOSPITAL- AND LIKE I SAID. OUR GOALS FORTY FIVE MINUTES. THE RESOLVER HERE OKAY THERE WE HEAR GOOD THANK YOU OKAY FANTASTIC. SO DO THE STUDIES- WE SHOULD WE USE REAL LIFE VICTIMS AND AT TIMES UP TO FIFTY M. AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THE FAR SERVICES REAL PROBLEM SPACE IS ACTUALLY MOVING VICTIMS FROM THE THREAT ZONE INTO THE IMPACTS ON THIS IS A PHOTO OF US- STAGING ROUGHLY FIFTY VICTIMS THAT ARE GOING TO GO INTO. A REAL LIFE NIGHT CLUB IN THE DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO COURT WHERE WE USED DJS TURN OFF LIGHTS WE BASICALLY RAIN ACT AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB. WE FOUND THAT- LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS AMAZING THEIR JOB THEY SUPPRESS THE THREAT VERY QUICKLY IN THESE DRILLS- FIRST OF SUCH A HARD TIME MOVING VICTIMS IN A TIMELY MANNER WHEN THE NUMBERS GOT HOT. IN THIS TRIAL WE LIKE SAID WE HAD OVER FIFTY LIVE PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTY SIX IN THE NEEDED TO BE. MOVED OUT MANUALLY AND PREPPED FOR TRANSPORT. THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED TO ADJUST OUR EQUIPMENT IF YOU LOOK DOWN ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER YOU'LL SEE WHAT IT'S CALLED FOXTROT. THIS IS THE BASIC TRACKS FLOOD. THIS ALLOWS US TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THAT AREA QUICKLY. WE WANT TO THESE FOR EVERY RIG IN THE- SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT. OUR NUMBERS DROP SIGNIFICANTLY OUR TIME FRAMES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN WE STARTED USING THESE TO QUANTIFY THAT. WE'RE ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO GET VICTIMS OUT OF THE BUILDING. IF MANUALLY WITH JUST FIREFIGHTERS TO GET TO PERSON KERRY OR IN A DIAMOND FORMATION. WHEN WE PUT THE FOXTROT IN THE PLAY. WE ARE TIMES WENT FROM FORTY FIVE MINUTES TEN TO TWELVE MINUTES. WHICH IS VERY FAST. NUMBER ALTERNATE GOALS TO GET ONE OF THESE VICTIMS TO SURGERY IN LESS THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES. SURGERIES WHAT TRULY SAVES THEIR LIVES. SO WHEN WE'RE UP AGAINST THE CLOCK. GETTING THEM OUT OF THE OF THE EXCELLENT FAST IS KEY. WE KNEW THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS WE STARTED SEEING OR TIMES DROP DOWN. INTO THE TWELVE MINUTES ON. THIS PARTICULAR DRILL HERE AT THE NIGHT CLUB IN SACRAMENTO OKAY. WHERE WE HAD OVER FIFTY PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTY SIX PEOPLE CAME OUT ON THE STREET. IN ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES WITH THE FOXTROT. REPRINTS FORTY EVERY VICTIM TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE DOWNTOWN AMBULANCES IN TWENTY SIX MINUTES. WHICH MEANT THAT WE WERE NOW HITTING OUR OBJECTIVES. USING SOME DIFFERENT TOOLS. WE A LOT FROM THE DRILLS. AND WE TRULY DIDN'T LIKE A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT. MEANING THAT OBSERVE MEASURED AND- WE HAD PROCTORS AT EVERY CORNER OF RECORDING DATA HOW QUICKLY FIREFIGHTERS BACK INTO THE ROOM WHEN TOURNIQUETS WERE APPLIED WHEN CHEST DEALS WERE APPLIED. IN THE AND HOW QUICKLY THE VICTIMS WERE MOVED OUT ONTO THE STREET. BY MEASURING EVERY ASPECT OF THIS THAT ALLOWED US TO REALLY HONE OUR TACTICS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED. BY GOING TO THIS WAS THAT THE- RESCUE TASK FORCE THAT A GREAT JOB OF GETTING US INTO THE THREAT ZONE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE VICTIMS OUT IN THE STANDARD TIME IN FORMATION. LEFT INSIDE OF THE SCREEN. YOU'LL SEE THE BASIC PLAYBOOK OF RESCUE TASK FORCE WHICH IS THREE TO FOUR FIREFIGHTERS REST ARE ESCORTED IN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO VICTIMS. AND A DIAMOND FORMATION IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF GETTING PEOPLE IN. BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO GET VICTIMS OUT IN THAT FORMATION WE KNOW THAT NOW. THAT THE CREW OF FOUR FIREFIGHTERS CAN EASILY PULL OUT FIVE VICTIMS THEY MAX OUT AT ABOUT TEN VICTIMS SO IF YOU HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF PEOPLE. IN A BUILDING OR ZONE YOU HAVE TO BRING IN A HIGH NUMBER OF FIREFIGHTERS. SIMMERED BETWEEN TWELVE TO TWENTY. WE RECOGNIZE THE DRILL THAT. WE EVERYTHING WE UP IN A POOR SO COULD START OFF IN A DIAMOND. BUT WE ALWAYS WOUND UP IN A SECURE CORE PLAN VICTIMS OUT. SO WE SAID WHY DON'T WE JUST START LIKE THAT. IF LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPRESSES THE THREATEN SET UP TO SECURE CORRIDOR ESCORTS AT SPIN. WILL BE MUCH FASTER MEMBERS OPENLY WHERE WE WOUND UP. IN ABOUT THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WAS USING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SET UP SECURE CORRIDOR BRINGING IN FIREFIGHTERS IN HIGH NUMBERS- WITH THEIR FOXTROT TO REMOVE VICTIMS. AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT. VERY FAST WE TRIED THIS. TACTIC WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES INCLUDING CHP. WE DO TO TEACH HER D. AV DHS DRILL AT CALPERS IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. AND OUR TIMES WERE VERY FAST WE HAD FIFTEEN LINE VICTIMS OUT ONTO THE STREET. IN SIX MINUTES- SO IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO SET UP SECURE QUARTER OR- TO MOVE THESE VICTIMS OUT. THIS IS A REAL SIMPLE PRE OUT ON WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SUCKING REACHING AND THE PROGRESSION THE FIRE SERVICE. WE THROUGH OUR OBSERVATIONS WE KNOW ONE PERSON IS VERY EFFECTIVE AT SUPPRESSING THE THREAT NOW. ARE QALINGE IS. GETTING INTO THE THREAT ZONE CONTROL IN THAT MEETING AND THEN GETTING VICTIMS TO THE HOSPITAL IN LESS THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTES IF OUR TACTICS ARE TOO SLOW. AND IT TAKES US AN HOUR TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE BUILDING- THEN WE'RE NOT MEETING OUR OVERALL MISSION WHICH IS STOPPING THE TIME. THROUGH THESE DRILLS AND WE STILL CONDUCT THEM- AT TACTICAL VILLAGE THAT SPD SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT TRAINING FACILITY WITH ALL THEIR RECRUITS AND FIRE- WE'VE LEARNED WE'VE GOTTEN FASTER AND COLLABORATING WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAS TAUGHT US A LOT TO USE THOSE BASIC TERMS. OF SECURE VICTIM VERSUS PATIENT IN THAT DIRECTORY INDIRECT THREATS- WITH THOSE WE ARE NOW MEETING OUR MISSIONS IN OUR DRILLS WE'VE HAD TWO ACTIVE SHOOTERS RECENTLY IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA- AND THEY WENT VERY SMOOTH BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO USE THIS TERMINOLOGY. AND THE AGENCIES AROUND THIS HAVE TRAINED WITH US AND WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER KNOWN. THAT IS GOING TO. FOR THE STOCK RE. BE PREPARED QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHIEF APPRECIATE THAT THANK TO ALL THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AND TESTIMONY BEFORE YOU OPEN IT UP TO MEMBERS QUESTION A COMMENTS- JUST WANNA. SPECIALLY THANK CHIEF MONTH ON SHERIFF PARKINSON THANK YOU AND YOUR MEN AND WOMEN FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT SO JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU SO WITHOUT ANY COLLEAGUES MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KOREA QUESTION COMMENT. THANK AND THANK YOU. TO THE PALACE- AND YOUR EXPERTISE BUT ALSO THE WORK YOU'VE DONE- WE ALWAYS WANT ME. HOW THE SHOOTING SEVEN SEAT AROUND THE COUNTRY- YOU YOU ALWAYS HOPE IS NOT YOUR HOME TOWN AND ON FORCING WITH THE VTA SHOOTING A WAS AND- SHE COULD NOT- WAS. CHEN HAD BEEN CHIEF AT THAT POINT DOESN'T JUST LESS THAN A HANDFUL MONTHS AND- HIS LEADERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP AND- THE QUICK ACTION. OF AS HE INDICATED MULTI JURISDICTIONAL RESPONSE. RESPONSE WAS CRITICAL THAT DAY BUT I THINK TO HIS POINT OF THIS OF THE COMES UP AND HAS COME UP OFTEN AND I'M AND I'M SURE- VICE CHAIR HAS WHAT IS A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THIS IS THE COMMUNICATIONS- ASPECT OF NOT BEING ON A SINGLE CHANNEL- A NUMBER IS REALLY KEEN I THINK OF THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT- WE'VE HEARD BEFORE RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A TAKE AWAY THAT WE CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY FROM THIS MEETING AND- AND LEAVE ON THE TABLE- BECAUSE WE SEE IT TIME AND AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY. EVERY TIME THERE'S A SHOOTING- INFORMS US WELL WE'VE BEEN EDUCATED MORE THAN WE'VE EVER WANTED TO- OVER THE LAST FEW FEW A FEW YEARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT I THINK THAT MESSAGE I THINK IN EVERY ONE OF THESE INSTANCES KEEPS COMING UP. IS THAT UNIFIED WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY IS WE HAVE THE UNIFIED TOGETHER AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE SHE BOUGHT THE FOR REITERATING THAT- BECAUSE I THINK- YOU KNOW BUT I THINK. THAT THAT'S WHERE AN INTO A- THE CCI SAILORS. IN OF MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN PEOPLE. WITH ALL THAT. IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT HOW COULD PROCESS COULD BE. AND THAT THE SITUATION. IS AT LEAST THE BEST OF. THE BEST ABILITY POSSIBLE EITHER COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZED OR AT LEAST ISOLATED SO THAT- SHE SAILORS AND HIS MEN AND WOMEN. CAN GET THE FOLKS AND GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL SO I THINK THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU HOLDING THIS HEARING BUT I THINK THAT MEANS A LOT WE CAN TAKE FROM THIS THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP ON THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF VULTURES AE OUT TO YOUR QUESTION. ACTUALLY I DO HAVE QUESTIONS AND ALSO THE MAIN QUESTION IS AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA IS POINTING OUT IS. WE NEED TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT HERE THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP MAKE THESE THINGS BETTER. AND FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE THAT MEANS. MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THE INFRASTRUCTURE- INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS UP TO SNUFF AND- AND THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS AS IS POINTED OUT HIS COMMUNICATION. AND THE- SAN LUIS OBISPO SHERIFF'S. THE TALK ABOUT THIS LITTLE BIT- BEYOND THE INTEROPERABLE IT ISSUE WITH. WITH OUR RADIOS ARE PORTABLE RADIOS. IT IS BEEN GOING ON FOR I THINK THE EFFORT HAS BEEN A BIG PUSH FOR THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF AT LEAST. AND IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS A TRAINING ISSUE STILL OR THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL STRUGGLING OR WERE HAVING TRANSMISSION TOWER ISSUES AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT HAVING ENOUGH. WE HAD A BIG SWITCH IN BAND WITH- ABOUT I THINK IT WAS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO AND- WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MORE- CELL TOWER OR- BED TOWER INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE PUT UP ON A BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO A SHORTER WAY. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH COMMUNICATION IS IT BOILS DOWN TO DISCIPLINE OR IS IT. IS IT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT'S NEEDED HOW CAN WE HELP. YOU MAKE THAT COMMITMENT THAT COMMUNICATION ISSUE BETTER BECAUSE THAT IS THE WHOLE KEY TO. IF YOU ARE A INCIDENT COMMANDER AND YOU DON'T HAVE COMMUNICATION THEN YOU'RE INCIDENT IS CHAOS. SO ANY OF YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME WITH THAT BECAUSE- IF THERE'S SOME ISSUES THERE THAT WE NEED TO INVEST. THEN CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD WE SHOULD START LOOKING AT DOING. MORE OF. SURE I CAN I CAN START HERE AND ON OUR END HERE IS AT. THE INTER OPERABILITY IS WORKING WHILE YOU'RE A SUCKER COUNTY- AND I KEEP MATCH IS ALWAYS BEING UPDATED- SO FOR US IT'S MORE. MORE ON THE TRAINING SIDE- HOW TO. HOW TO DEPLOY IT ONE SIDE THESE- EXISTENCE I KNOW WE WERE ALL SET TO GO TO A CHANNEL. AGAIN IT'S- HAVING TO UNIFIED COMMAND. TO SET THOSE TRIGGERS- OR TO DIRECT INCOMING RESOURCES AS TO WHAT TO DO- BUT- I THE INFRASTRUCTURES THERE. AND IT'S BEING UPDATED CONSTANTLY. HOWEVER AT THIS IS YOUR MENTIONS IT FOR US IT COULD BE A DURING HIS TRIP. TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE ON THE SAME CHANNEL AND- WE HAVE THIS RIGHT TODAY SEKHON PLANS FOR YOU GUYS BEFORE WELL YOU'RE RESPONDING TO THE INCIDENT SO THAT YOU HAVE A COMP PLAN WHEN YOU GET THERE- BECAUSE THAT IS THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND REALLY HELPFUL- IN THE COUNTY WAS IN L. A. COUNTY WAS. AT HAVING A COMP PLAN BEFORE WE EVEN GOT ON SCENE- THAT THE- THE INCIDENT COMMANDER WOULD ALREADY REQUESTED AND HAVE IT SO EVERYBODY HAD IT ON THERE INDICATE. THAT WHAT THE COMP PLAN WAS. WELL TO CHECK IS IF YOU HAVE OF THOSE BY THE I KNOW THAT- I CAN MENTION MAJORITY OUR RESOURCES ARE COMING IN. THE SENSE OF WHERE SAN JOSE. AND WE WERE ALL ON OUR CHANNEL THERE. NORMAL CHILD FOR THAT AREA. AND WE ASKED EVERYBODY- SWITCH THAT CHANNEL AND- SOMEWHERE AND SO. RIGHT AND FOR THE SHERIFF FROM FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO IT WAS ONE OF YOUR- CHIEF DOWN THERE IN A ROW GRANDET BELIEVE. WAS REALLY HEAVY INTO HELPING WITH THIS INTER OPERABILITY PUSH- IT IS THE INTER OPERABILITY WHILE IT'S REALLY GOOD UP AND SAN JOSE IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS- CARRYING ON STATEWIDE OR DO WE HAVE STILL AREAS THAT ARE DEFICIT IN THIS. WELL I THINK- I AGREE WITH WHAT THE CHIEF SAID FIRST- I THINK A LOT OF IT IS. IS EITHER OPS PLAN OR- YOU KNOW TRAINING. BORE US- WE DO HAVE GOOD INTER OPERABILITY WITHIN THE COUNTY SO ALL OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND WE DO HAVE AN OFFICE PLAN IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WHEN THEY RESPONDED THEY'RE DIRECTED TO WHAT CHANNEL THEY'RE OPERATING ON- THERE'S TWO CHALLENGES THAT I SEE NUMBER ONE. IS WHEN YOU YOU KNOW WE'VE TAKEN AREA LIKE SAN JOSE OR EVEN US WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THOSE AGENCIES YOU HAVE. YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW. EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON THE SAME CHANNEL- WHICH BECOMES AN ISSUE BUT I THINK WHERE YOU GUYS COULD COME INTO PLAY AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS. IS C. H. P. FOR EXAMPLE- THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT OPERATING ON OUR CHANNEL AND HAVING THOSE CAPABILITIS I THINK ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE STAGE BE IN OUR AREA ON A DAILY BASIS WE CAN. EDUCATE RACKLEY WITH THERE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY BUT YOUR BASIC- STAGE BE A TROLL OFFICER- THAT IS AN ISSUE- FEDERAL PARTNERS ANOTHER ISSUE BUT OUR ISSUE IN PARTICULAR OUR FIRST ONE WAS. IS HAVING OUTSIDE- COUNTY AGENCIES COME IN THAT DON'T HAVE- THAT ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND SO WORKING ON TRYING TO COME UP YOU KNOW WITH A COMMENT CHANNEL LIKE FOR. FOR REGION ONE AA- SAN LUIS SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA WE DO HAVE A COMMON CHANNEL THAT WE CAN OPERATE ON SO THAT'S FINE BUT AS SOON AS YOU GO EAST OR NORTH OF US OUTSIDE OF OUR REGION. THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES A PROBLEM BUT I WOULD SAY THE BIG PUSH IS. PARTICULARLY WITH THE STATUS IS GETTING STAGE BEYOND OPERATION CHANNEL THAT THEY CAN COMMUNICATE WITH US DIRECTLY IN THERE YOU KNOW RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU. FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS- WITHOUT OVERSEE A THE WHOLE POINT HAVING THIS HEARINGS TO HEAR SOME OF THIS INFORMATION I WOULDN'T BE OF HELPFUL OVERSEE COMMUNICATIONS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE KEY FOR ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS A SPECIAL AREN'T RESPONDING TO.

WE WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING RUMORED SOME VITIATED SO NOT SO LET'S HEAR FROM ANNOUNCES ORINDA SCHOOL SAFETY CONSULTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA. APARTMENT EDUCATION ANNOUNCE YOUR EITHER. I VERY GOOD MORNING. ARE WE CONNECTED BY OUR YOU ARE ON TWITTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OUR SAFETY POLICIES THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. I'M NANCY SEVEN DONE EDUCATION PROGRAMS CONSULTANT IN THE SCHOOL HEALTH AND SAFETY OFFICE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS VERY IMPACTFUL LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA ALL PUBLIC REGARDING THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. I HAVE DEVELOP ANNUALLY AND UPDATE A COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PATHS WITH NUMEROUS REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSCRIPTS HEATERS FOR SCHOOL CLIMATE PHYSICAL SETTINGS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS AS BULLYING CHILD ABUSE PROCEDURES DISCRIMINATION HATE CRIMES AND MUCH MUCH MORE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITORS CONDUCTED AN AUDIT ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE. PREVENTION IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TOGETHER THEY'RE CALLED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR L. B. AS- FINDINGS A RECOMMENDATIONS REPORT AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND THE STATE MUST DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS. HELP PROTECT STUDENTS AND STAFF DURING EMERGENCIES IT ALSO REPORTED THAT DISTRICTS COULD BENEFIT FROM BEST PRACTICES TO VERIFY PLAN SUBMISSIONS AND APPROVALS. ASSEMBLY BILL RESPONDED SWIFTLY TO THE STATE AUDIT WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY STRENGTHENS THE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANNING PROCESS. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS HAD THREE MAIN REQUIREMENTS FROM ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. THE FIRST IS FOR CD EIGHT TO PROVIDE GENERAL DIRECTION- BUILDING DISASTER PLANS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE OVERALL PLAN. CDA CONSULT INTERNALLY WITH OUR FACILITIES DEFICIENT EXTERNALLY WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ADAM WITH CALIFORNIA STATE. BERMAN OF GENERAL SERVICES DIVISION OF STATE ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE ALLIANCE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND DRAFTED GENERAL GUIDANCE BASED ON THE BEST THINKING OF THESE AGENCIES. AS FOLLOWS EMERGENCY PROCEDURES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AND ADAPTED TO EACH SCHOOL'S NEEDS HANDLE AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN COLLABORATION WITH FIRST RESPONDERS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS IS DISASTER PLANS MAY INCLUDE FIRE RELOCATION EVACUATION BOB THREAT BIOTERRORISM EARTHQUAKES FLOODS POWER FAILURE INTRUDERS HOSTAGE WEAPONS EXPLOSION GAS FUMES AND DISASTER PLANS FOR OUTBREAKS OF PANDEMIC DISEASES THE GENERAL WAS. IN FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEIR AFTER ANNUALLY IN THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT LETTER TO THE FIELD REMINDING ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN UPDATES. THE POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM THIS ITEM HAS BEEN THAT ELLIE AS ARE ASKING FOR MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM OUR AGENCIES ARE COLLABORATING AND MORE AWARE OF HAZARDS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. THAT HAVE HELPED THEM DEVELOP THESE DISASTER PLAN. THE SECOND REQUIREMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN TO DEVELOP AND POST ON OUR WEBSITE BEST PRACTICES FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FELT THIS WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO REACH OUT DIRECTLY TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO OUR- SAFETY PLANNERS AT THE COUNTY'S. AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE SCHEDULE THREE IN PERSON. MEETINGS FOR INFORMATION GATHERING AS THEY WORK TO BE A PLASTER CARD AND ORANGE COUNTY. DUE TO THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND ABBAS'S CLOSING THE CDC WAS NOT ABLE TO HOLD IN PERSON MEETINGS. HOWEVER WE SEE WE PRESIDENT QUICKLY DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY IT WAS DISSEMINATED TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND TO THEIR CASE SAFETY PERSONNEL. THE SURVEY WAS NOT REQUIRED BY THE SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN IT WAS TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE REAL NEEDS AND CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD. HERE I WILL HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW INSIGHTFUL RESULTS FROM THE SURVEY. NEARLY TWO HUNDRED RESPONSES THAT REPRESENTED CENTRAL NORTH AND SOUTH CALIFORNIA FROM URBAN AND RURAL. ENTITIES RESPONDED THE TRAINING EXPERIENCE OF THOSE IN CHARGE OF EMERGENCY PLANNING COMPLIANCE HAVE. 18% HAD EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TRAINING OR LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE AND MOST OF THE TRAINING OCCURRED AT THE DISTRICT FOR THE OTHERS. 47% HELD SCHOOL SAFETY MEETINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS THE OTHERS HELP THEM AS NEEDED OR ONCE ANIMAL. 96% COLLABORATE WITH THEIR EXTERNAL AGENCIES. AND LOCAL OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ACTIVE SHOOTER ADVENTURE TRAVEL AND OTHER EMERGENCY PLANNING. A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES GATHER THEIR CRIME AND SAFETY DATA WHICH IS REQUIRED IN THE SAFETY PLAN FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES MOSTLY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION DATA CHILD WELFARE AND ATTENDANCE OFFICE INSURANCE PROVIDERS SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. 92% OF THE L. A. A.'S ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF WITH DISABILITIES. MANY POLICIES INCLUDE HOW MANY MANY PLANS INCLUDE POLICIES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW IT THIS TIME BEHAVIORAL THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS LOCKDOWN DRILLS ARE TOO IMPORTANT ONCE. L. SCHOOL SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING OF STAFF AND STUDENTS VARIES GREATLY AMONG THE ENTITIES. 4% HAVE REPORTED NON COMPLIANT SCHOOLS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THOUGH THIS MAY SOUND LIKE A SMALL NUMBER IS UP FROM NEARLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. 86% USE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RESOURCES FOR SCHOOL SAFETY PLANNING. AND OTHERS THAT ARE USED ARE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT HELLO YES CAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. COMMON OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLANNING REPORTED AS LIMITED STAFF STAFF TURNOVER SAFETY PLANS THAT ARE CHECKED OFF AND PUT ON A SHELF NOT PRACTICED AND NOT IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY AND LACK OF FUNDING FOR TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. 61% HAVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS PLANTS IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND 61% COMMUNICATE SAFETY INFORMATION TO FAMILIES. IN THE PARENT HANDBOOK OTHERS BY EMAIL ANSEM NOTICES GO OUT IN THE STUDENT BACKPACK EXPRESS. THE THIRD ITEM THAT THE CITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IS TO MAINTAIN UPDATE AND POST A COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST FOR DEVELOPING SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS. THIS IS AN OPTIONAL USED TOOL AND IT HAS BEEN POSTED SINCE AT LEAST TWENTY FIFTEEN. THE TOOL IS UPDATED ANNUALLY AND WE'RE LEGISLATION. COMES ABOUT AND IT CONTAINS CURRENTLY AND REFERS TO ALL OF THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. POSITIVE OUTCOMES ON THE COMPLIANCE LIST HAVE BEEN BAD ALL SCHOOLS AND DISTRICT AND THE PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS TO IT. IT IS INTENDED TO BE USED AS A CHECKLIST. AND IN CONCLUSION I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE CD IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. THANK ROADS NANCY SO NOW WE'LL GO ON TO OUR NEXT A PRISONER CHIEF JOE JUSTICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS THE- SOCIAL ASIAN- CHIEF ARE YOU THERE. I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE'RE NEAR. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD MY NAME IS JOEL JUSTICE AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. OUR ASSOCIATION HAS A LONG. HISTORY OF ADDRESSING CAMPUS SAFETY ISSUES AND HAS BEEN AN EARLY PROPONENT OF THE USE OF AN OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY IN ADDRESSING NATIONAL INCIDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE SPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN NINETY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FLORA COOPER AND SENATOR. GALGIANI THE BILL INVOLVED INTO A. FIVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS MASS SHOOTER INCIDENTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES THE CONCEPT WAS ROOTED IN THE MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL PUBLIC SAFETY COMMISSION REPORT TO GOVERNOR SCOTT OF FLORIDA WHICH STATED THAT NEED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF FIRST RESPONDERS TO STRIVE. FOR COMMUNICATION AND- OPERABILITY. IS THIS VERY LACK OF INTEROPERABLE THE LACK THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT EXPONENTIALLY MAGNIFIED THE TRAGEDY OF MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL AS FIRST RESPONDERS DID NOT RECEIVE REAL TIME COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SCHOOL SITE. THE COMMUNICATIONS SO DEFICIENT THAT THE SHOOTER HAD ALREADY KILLED SEVENTEEN PEOPLE AND LEFT THE CAMPUS BY THE TIME FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVED IN FLORIDA UNLIKE CALIFORNIA NOW HAS STATEWIDE GENERAL OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY COVERING EVERY COUNTY AND FLORIDA. WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CREATORS AND OPERATORS OF THE FLORIDA CENTER OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY AND PROVIDED THE NAMES OF THE THREE FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE WITH DEEP EXPERIENCE WITH FLORIDA'S OUR SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO YOUR COMMITTEE. REPORT THAT THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN TODAY'S HEARING. WE HAD APPROACHED OUR TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SUCCESS WITH HAVING AN OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY IN THE BUDGET WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION AND WE READILY SHARED OUR EXPERTISE AND OUR EXPERIENCE WITH FLORIDA LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S- OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES COMPLETELY IGNORED EVERITT WHAT WITH THE RESULT THAT CALIFORNIA UNLIKE FLORIDA DOES NOT HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT PROTECTS OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE FILED A NARRATIVE OF OUR INTERACTION WITH- YES WITH YOUR COMMITTEE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SETBACKS PARCELS HE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF THEIR OPERABILITY TECHNOLOGY- THAT WILL ENHANCE SCHOOL SAFETY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THE EVENTUAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT GOAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
