CERTAINLY [inaudible]

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:45.998 region:rollup2
SPREADING --

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:47.399 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES ABOUT THE FLAT EARTH

00:22:45.998 --> 00:22:48.968 region:rollup2
THOUGH ARE --

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:50.302 region:rollup2
AND MAY SEEM SOMEWHAT AMUSING

00:22:48.968 --> 00:22:53.539 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN IT STARTS MOVING TO

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:54.974 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE HOLOCAUST DENIAL --

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:56.508 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION AND IMMUNIZATION

00:22:54.974 --> 00:22:57.843 region:rollup2
RATES BECAUSE FOR CONTINUED RA

00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:59.578 region:rollup2
REPETITION THAT VACCINES CAUSE

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:00.112 region:rollup2
AUTISM.

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:01.146 region:rollup2
GOING TO ACTUALLY WHAT'S

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.616 region:rollup2

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:04.883 region:rollup2
MORE RECENTLY WHERE I YOU HAVE

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:08.120 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DENYING --

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:10.990 region:rollup2
SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED AND

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.624 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE PARK LAND AND AND

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.459 region:rollup2
YEAH AND ACTUALLY I ACTUALLY UP

00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:15.261 region:rollup2

00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:16.495 region:rollup2
WIND ALSO PRONE TO MANIPULATION

00:23:15.261 --> 00:23:19.698 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO A

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:22.167 region:rollup2
COMPETING PROTESTS AND I AND YOU

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:23.102 region:rollup2
STAND UP THROUGH MANIPULATION.

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:24.737 region:rollup2
SPREAD OF FLUFF FALSE

00:23:23.102 --> 00:23:26.438 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA

00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:28.207 region:rollup2
THAT FACT WE KNOW THAT --

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:29.708 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS

00:23:28.207 --> 00:23:31.410 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:33.145 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT THE SCIENCE SHOW

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.546 region:rollup2
WALMART TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:35.681 region:rollup2
SCIENCE MAGAZINE REPORTED THAT.

00:23:34.546 --> 00:23:37.316 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY INVESTIGATED

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:39.118 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION OF ALL

00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:39.918 region:rollup2
THE FAIR BY TRUE AND FALSE NEWS

00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:43.055 region:rollup2
STORIES DISTRIBUTE TWITTER

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.622 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN?

00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:44.823 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:46.325 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT FALSE INFORMATION

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:48.093 region:rollup2
FALSEHOODS WOULD DIFFUSE

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:49.561 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FARTHER FASTER

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:51.130 region:rollup2
DEEPER MORE BROADLY.

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:52.097 region:rollup2
THEN TRUE INFORMATION IN ALL

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.565 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION AND

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:55.467 region:rollup2
FACT THE SPREAD OF FALSE

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:57.336 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SPREAD TWICE AS

00:23:55.467 --> 00:23:59.104 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND TWICE AS FAR.

00:23:57.336 --> 00:24:00.506 region:rollup2
ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.573 region:rollup2
SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES ARE

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:02.741 region:rollup2
THE PLATFORMS FOR WHICH SOUGHT

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:03.976 region:rollup2
FALSE INFORMATION SPREADS IT'S

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:05.177 region:rollup2
GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT

00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:06.645 region:rollup2
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:08.013 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:09.481 region:rollup2
SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE COMING UP

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:10.115 region:rollup2
WITH PLANS TO TRY TO MITIGATE

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.417 region:rollup2
THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.851 region:rollup2
--

00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:13.519 region:rollup2
BUT PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW WHAT

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.120 region:rollup2
THOSE PLANS ARE AND THEY KNOW IF

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:16.155 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.556 region:rollup2
BY ASKING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

00:24:16.155 --> 00:24:18.757 region:rollup2
LET'S KNOW IF THEY HAVE A PLAN

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:20.492 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE WE CAN

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:23.295 region:rollup2
BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW NEWS.

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:24.530 region:rollup2
SPREADS CONTINUE WORKING GROUP

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.764 region:rollup2
TO STUDY STRATEGIC PLAN MILES BE

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.232 region:rollup2
THE FIRST STEP IN WORKING TO

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:28.467 region:rollup2
SLOW THE SPREAD OF FALSE

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:30.069 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OPEN THE FUTURE WILL

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.337 region:rollup2
BE A BETTER BE ABLE TO PROTECT

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:33.205 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC FROM.

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:34.974 region:rollup2
HARM THAT CAN COME FROM THAT

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:36.308 region:rollup2
CAUSED BY UNTRUE STORIES THIS

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.843 region:rollup2
REALLY BECOMES AT THE FOUNDATION

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.812 region:rollup2
OF DEMOCRACY.

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:42.381 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY --

00:24:39.812 --> 00:24:44.083 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER WHAT.

00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:45.351 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY LIMITING WHAT ANYONE

00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:46.719 region:rollup2
WANTS TO SAY OUR CANCER

00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:48.587 region:rollup2
INCLUDING EVEN.

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:50.122 region:rollup2
SAYING FALSE INFORMATION --

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:51.890 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:24:50.122 --> 00:24:53.158 region:rollup2
THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.159 region:rollup2
HOW WE ARE PROMOTING HOW THAT'S

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.760 region:rollup2
BEING POTENTIALLY BEING

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.829 region:rollup2
DISSEMINATED IN FACT EVEN OVER

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.497 region:rollup2
--

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.832 region:rollup2
TRUTH OUT ACCURATE AND TRUE

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.1000 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND THAT

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.334 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IT'S GONNA BE

00:25:00.1000 --> 00:25:03.736 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.838 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT OUR

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:08.340 region:rollup2

OF THIS BILL.

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:17.649 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT CNN IS THEIR OPPOSITION.

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:22.388 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE BRING BACK THE

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:23.088 region:rollup2

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.792 region:rollup2
REALLY TAKING A GOOD LOOK AT

THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VERY

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:31.263 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO

00:25:29.228 --> 00:25:32.398 region:rollup2

00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:40.706 region:rollup2
DELICATE WHEN WE DEAL WITH THE

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:42.341 region:rollup2
INTERNET AND DISSEMINATION OF OF

INFORMATION SO I THINK I DO

00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:45.944 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN.

00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:48.046 region:rollup2
HOW WE SEEK TO RESTRICT

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:50.349 region:rollup2
INFORMATION EVEN IF WE FIND IT

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:51.150 region:rollup2
OFFENSIVE OR DIFFICULT OR OR

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:53.285 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE?

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.920 region:rollup2

00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:57.462 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT SIR THANK YOU MISTER

00:39:55.793 --> 00:40:00.331 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN AND THE LETTER OF

00:39:57.462 --> 00:40:00.632 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION FROM THE SCHOOL

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:03.735 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:40:00.632 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCIES.

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:07.405 region:rollup2
INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY WANT

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.705 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN AN IMMUNITY

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:09.774 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:11.142 region:rollup2
RELIABILITY AND WHEREAS THE

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:13.344 region:rollup2
LETTER SAID THAT SUBCONTRACTOR

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:14.946 region:rollup2
SIT ON THE SIDELINES --

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.580 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK THAT THE ROOFER

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:16.848 region:rollup2
SHOULD PAY FOR THE ELECTRICIAN'S

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.017 region:rollup2
ERRORS.

00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:20.451 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THE BILL DOES CLARIFY

00:40:19.017 --> 00:40:22.086 region:rollup2
FOR ALL TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION A

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.454 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT BIDDING PROCESS

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:25.123 region:rollup2
WHEREBY WE KNOW AS

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:27.492 region:rollup2
SUBCONTRACTORS Y. TYPE OF

00:40:25.123 --> 00:40:29.060 region:rollup2
INSURANCE IS BEING OFFERED TO US

00:40:27.492 --> 00:40:30.295 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS RAP PROGRAM.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.864 region:rollup2
IT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:33.164 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WOULD OFFER ADEQUATE

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:36.834 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:38.469 region:rollup2
LIABILITY PROVISIONS IN TERMS OF

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:40.138 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBILITY.

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:41.906 region:rollup2
THE TERM OF THE POLICY HOW LONG

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:44.909 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS THAT THE PROJECT IS

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:45.543 region:rollup2
DONE EXCEPTIONS TO THE POLICY.

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:46.778 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.912 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT.

00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:48.780 region:rollup2
BUT THEN TO SAY THAT THIS IS A

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.114 region:rollup2
COST TO THE TAXPAYERS WHEN IN

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.115 region:rollup2
FACT.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:53.418 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAD OFFER THIS

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:55.987 region:rollup2
INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY AND INFO

00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:56.521 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:58.690 region:rollup2
THE KETTLE CALLING THE POT

00:40:56.521 --> 00:41:00.191 region:rollup2
BLACK.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.693 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF THEM NOT

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.394 region:rollup2
OFFERING AN ADEQUATE INSURANCE

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:04.829 region:rollup2
POLICY TO BEGIN WITH.

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.630 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO LABOR WITHIN

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:07.398 region:rollup2
COULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR YEARS

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.700 region:rollup2
TO COME.

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.368 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T THINK THEIR

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.002 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS ARE VALID.

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:12.103 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY MISINTERPRETED THE

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:15.006 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS STATE POLICY THAT IS

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.240 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE TRIED

00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:18.042 region:rollup2
TO DO LAST YEAR WITH PAYMENTS

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.477 region:rollup2
FROM PUBLIC ENTITIES.

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:21.012 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT REGARD FOR THOSE

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:24.949 region:rollup2
REASONS WE THINK THAT THEM THEIR

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:26.384 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS HAVE MISPLACED.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.951 region:rollup2
I I STRUGGLE A BIT WITH THAT

00:41:26.384 --> 00:41:29.253 region:rollup2
THAT EXPLANATION I THINK I'M

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:31.422 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:32.590 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THAT THIS

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
IS IN FACT SHIFTING THE

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.126 region:rollup2
INDEMNITIES OF THOSE I WOULD BE

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.494 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:41:35.126 --> 00:41:38.062 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND HAVING GONE

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.364 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS.

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.865 region:rollup2
BEEN HAVING BEEN ON THE SCHOOL

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:43.101 region:rollup2
BOARD WHERE THERE WERE

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:44.435 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.571 region:rollup2
CAUSED BY A SUBCONTRACTOR IN THE

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:47.972 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:49.474 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS WERE THEN OUT A

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.408 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEIR

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:53.411 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:54.178 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE WON THE SUIT WE

00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:55.380 region:rollup2
BASICALLY PAID PENNIES ON THE

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:58.950 region:rollup2
DOLLAR [inaudible]

00:41:55.380 --> 00:42:00.051 region:rollup2
AND HAVING BEEN.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.819 region:rollup2
A PART OF A GOVERNING

00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:03.821 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION NOT THE EXPERTISE

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:05.323 region:rollup2
AND CONSTRUCTION.

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:07.225 region:rollup2
THAT IT SOARED SHIFTING THAT

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:08.593 region:rollup2
BURDEN OBLIGATIONS FOR INSURANCE

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:08.893 region:rollup2
OUR OBLIGATIONS TO BE

00:42:08.593 --> 00:42:11.162 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:13.064 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE SHIFTING THAT'S A

00:42:11.162 --> 00:42:14.665 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AGENCY IS IS REALLY THAT

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:16.968 region:rollup2

THE EXPERTS AND THAT'S SO AYE

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:19.270 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:20.972 region:rollup2
BILL.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:23.574 region:rollup2
SHIFTS THE INDEMNITY.

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:26.010 region:rollup2

EXPECTING.

TO BE PUTTING ONLINE VERY.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.029 region:rollup2
LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:47.865 region:rollup2

FUNDED THROUGH A THROUGH BOND OR

OR OTHER PROVISIONS SO IT'S I

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:52.837 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:53.838 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE'RE PUSHING BACK ON

00:42:52.837 --> 00:42:55.506 region:rollup2

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:50.281 region:rollup2
PREACHED IN THOSE INSTANCES.

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:51.849 region:rollup2
I AM A CONSUMER COULD SEEK

THINK THAT'S IN HIGH HARLEY

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.320 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:57.788 region:rollup2
I'M BENEFICIAL FOR CONSUMERS AND

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.323 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL ACTUALLY

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.924 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO KEEP

00:50:59.323 --> 00:51:00.925 region:rollup2
OUR INFORMATION SECURE IN THE

00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:03.394 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE.

00:51:00.925 --> 00:51:03.661 region:rollup2
I URGE DRIVE OUT.

00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:05.162 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:51:03.661 --> 00:51:06.564 region:rollup2
WHOSE.

THANK YOU AGAIN MY NAME IS

00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:08.132 region:rollup2
TIMOTHY BLOOD I'M FROM SAN DIEGO

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:10.267 region:rollup2
--

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:12.069 region:rollup2
IDEA IN IN ADDITION TO BEING A

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:14.138 region:rollup2
BOARD MEMBER OF CHAU SEE --

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:14.905 region:rollup2
I'VE ALSO LITIGATED NUMBER OF

00:51:14.138 --> 00:51:17.174 region:rollup2
DATA BREACH --

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:18.208 region:rollup2
BILL ARE CASES I'M.

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:20.511 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN AT THE

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:22.079 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT OF DATA PRIVACY FOR

00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:23.347 region:rollup2
DECADES LITERALLY SINCE THE

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:25.015 region:rollup2
SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES.

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:26.016 region:rollup2
YOU RITA A BILL THAT WAS PASSED

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:27.384 region:rollup2
IN THE LAWN THE NINETEEN

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:28.819 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS.

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:30.888 region:rollup2
IT WAS UP PASSED YESTERDAY IN

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:32.323 region:rollup2
HIS IS CURRENT AND ADDRESSES THE

00:51:30.888 --> 00:51:33.324 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIANS

00:51:32.323 --> 00:51:34.591 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS HAVE OVER DATA

00:51:33.324 --> 00:51:36.260 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:38.495 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS TECHNOLOGY HAS

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.931 region:rollup2
OUTSTRIPPED THE LAW SO WE DON'T

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:42.666 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE A* ANY STATUTORY

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:44.168 region:rollup2
PROTECTION THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:46.270 region:rollup2
IT ENDS UP PROVIDING THE

00:51:44.168 --> 00:51:47.571 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES OF OF GOOD COMPANIES

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.906 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT DATA.

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:51.075 region:rollup2
IT INCENTIVIZE BAD COMPANIES TO

00:51:48.906 --> 00:51:53.744 region:rollup2
NOT PROTECT DATA AND HAS THE

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:56.013 region:rollup2
EFFECT OF ALLOWING A DATA PROP

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:57.881 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT THIEVES --

00:51:56.013 --> 00:52:01.218 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO OBTAIN DATA --

00:51:57.881 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
AYE PRIVACY DATA PRIVATE DATA

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:06.023 region:rollup2
AND THEN --

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.825 region:rollup2
USING IT USE THAT THE STEEL ARE.

00:52:06.023 --> 00:52:09.393 region:rollup2
CONSUMER INFORMATION AND MONEY.

00:52:07.825 --> 00:52:11.128 region:rollup2
I'M THIS BILL DOES A COUPLE OF

00:52:09.393 --> 00:52:12.096 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS I'M.

00:52:11.128 --> 00:52:15.733 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL CHANGES THE

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:17.201 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF OF A CONSUMER TO

00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:19.670 region:rollup2
ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT IS VITALLY

00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:21.572 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WAY USED

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.806 region:rollup2
TO BE IS THE PERSON OR THE

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:24.008 region:rollup2
COMPANY THAT YOU HAD A BUSINESS

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.642 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH.

00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:27.244 region:rollup2
A WAS THE ONE THAT HAD YOU WRITE

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.912 region:rollup2
YOUR AT PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:30.814 region:rollup2
IS NO LONGER THE CASE NOW IT IS

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.016 region:rollup2
LARGE DATA AGGREGATORS THAT HAVE

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:33.651 region:rollup2
YOUR INFORMATION.

00:52:32.016 --> 00:52:34.918 region:rollup2
PEOPLE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY

00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.388 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:37.921 region:rollup2
EQUIFAX IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:39.056 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT JUST A CREDIT

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:40.290 region:rollup2
BUREAU.

00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:42.126 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEY ARE ALSO DATA

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.461 region:rollup2
AGGREGATOR IN FACT THEY ARE

00:52:42.126 --> 00:52:46.330 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY A DATA AGGREGATOR AND

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:48.332 region:rollup2
REGULAR CONSUMERS HAVE NO.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.467 region:rollup2
BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:52.036 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LIKE EQUIFAX IN TERMS

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:53.137 region:rollup2
OF OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO WITH

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:54.772 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION SO YOU DON'T

00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:55.339 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:56.807 region:rollup2
WITH THEM.

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:58.709 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGES THAT SO THAT IT

00:52:56.807 --> 00:53:00.911 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY TO WOULD MAKE THIS

00:52:58.709 --> 00:53:02.379 region:rollup2
STATUTE AFFABLE OUGHT TO PROTECT

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:03.947 region:rollup2
ALL PEOPLE --

00:53:02.379 --> 00:53:05.382 region:rollup2
DOT RATHER THAN JUST PEOPLE WHO

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:06.583 region:rollup2
HAVE A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THE

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:08.352 region:rollup2
SECOND THING IT DOES IS IT

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.886 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES

00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:10.087 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S SOME

00:53:08.886 --> 00:53:11.822 region:rollup2
CONFUSION.

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:14.091 region:rollup2
ON WHAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:14.658 region:rollup2
PROVISION DOES THERE'S TWO

00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:16.060 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AT ISSUE

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:18.095 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:20.030 region:rollup2
ONE CONCEPT IS IDENTITY THEFT SO

00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:22.032 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN AID IDENTITY THIEF

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:23.534 region:rollup2
TAKES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:25.569 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY USE THAT TO DRAIN

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:27.705 region:rollup2
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO STEAL YOUR

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:29.907 region:rollup2
IDENTITY TO PROFIT SOMEHOW

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:30.474 region:rollup2
ILLEGALLY FROM YOUR INFORMATION.

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:33.043 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT FROM

00:53:30.474 --> 00:53:34.545 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.779 region:rollup2
ONCE THERE IS A DATA BREACH

00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:37.081 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHEN THE DATA THIEVES

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:38.449 region:rollup2
GO IN AND TAKE THE PERSONAL

00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:41.585 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM A COMPANY THAT

00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:43.320 region:rollup2
IS NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTING IT.

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:45.222 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE STEPS IN

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.491 region:rollup2
ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:49.193 region:rollup2
AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT.

00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:51.261 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES

00:53:49.193 --> 00:53:52.129 region:rollup2
DO IS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:54.231 region:rollup2
SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
TO SPEND. TO TAKE THOSE STEPS TO

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:58.335 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEMSELVES.

00:53:56.033 --> 00:54:00.804 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE EQUIFAX CHARGES

00:53:58.335 --> 00:54:02.639 region:rollup2
TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:03.173 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION NOW

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.642 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:07.277 region:rollup2
PROTECTION IT'S NOT GONNA GOING

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:09.079 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT.

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:10.514 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS GOING TO MINIMIZE THE

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.715 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF IDENTITY THEFT FROM

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:13.617 region:rollup2
OCCURRING.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:15.986 region:rollup2
IT WILL EFFECTIVELY IF PEOPLE

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:17.387 region:rollup2
HAVE IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION.

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:18.989 region:rollup2
IT WILL DISINCENTIVE BUYS

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:20.390 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THIEVES.

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:22.025 region:rollup2
FROM FROM STEALING INFORMATION

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:23.060 region:rollup2
TO BEGIN WITH.

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.628 region:rollup2
AND THEN USING UP THE PROFIT

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.763 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'LL BE HARDER FOR THEM

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:27.998 region:rollup2
TO PROFIT IF PEOPLE HAVE

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:29.733 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION.

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:31.969 region:rollup2
SO IT'S TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:33.303 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR IT AND THE STATURE

00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:35.038 region:rollup2
DAMAGES RANGE FROM.

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:36.573 region:rollup2
A TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:38.809 region:rollup2
VIOLATION TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:39.476 region:rollup2
PER VIOLATION WHAT TWENTY

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:40.677 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH THAT ONE CAN DO

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:42.279 region:rollup2
THE MATH --

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:43.447 region:rollup2
TUNER DOLLARS IS LESS THAN ONE

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:45.349 region:rollup2
YEAR'S WORTH OF IDENTITY THEFT

00:54:43.447 --> 00:54:46.917 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:49.586 region:rollup2
MOST EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU THAT

00:54:46.917 --> 00:54:51.889 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN ALMOST ALL DAY THAT.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:53.891 region:rollup2
A DATA BREACH CASES ONE YEAR IS

00:54:51.889 --> 00:54:54.424 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY ENOUGH IDENTITY THEFT

00:54:53.891 --> 00:54:55.459 region:rollup2
PROTECTION BUT IT'S A GOOD

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.727 region:rollup2
START.

00:54:55.459 --> 00:54:58.362 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY

00:54:56.727 --> 00:54:59.263 region:rollup2
DOING THE MATH IS JUST OVER FOUR

00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:01.031 region:rollup2
YEARS OF IDENTITY THEFT

00:54:59.263 --> 00:55:02.499 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:04.501 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:05.636 region:rollup2
AYE NUMBER TAKEN THAT IS AN

00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:07.337 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE PIECE OF

00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:09.306 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND YOU WILL NEED TO

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:11.341 region:rollup2
PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IDENTITY

00:55:09.306 --> 00:55:12.376 region:rollup2
THEFT FOR FAR MORE THAN FOUR

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.811 region:rollup2
YEARS BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR

00:55:12.376 --> 00:55:15.813 region:rollup2
SOUL SECURITY NUMBER. FOR YOUR

00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
ENTIRE LIFE SO HAT IS THE

00:55:15.813 --> 00:55:19.716 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF STATUTORY DAMAGES

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:22.052 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:23.153 region:rollup2
NOT SUFFERED ECONOMIC HARM.

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:23.887 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED ECONOMIC

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
HARM.

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:26.590 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:27.224 region:rollup2
PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM IDENTITY

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.292 region:rollup2
THEFT.

00:55:27.224 --> 00:55:29.960 region:rollup2
NOW KEEP IN MIND WHAT THIS ENDS

00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:31.929 region:rollup2
UP DOING.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.297 region:rollup2
THE BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE BAD

00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:34.631 region:rollup2
COMPANIES COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:36.266 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY TAKING THE TIME AND

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:38.001 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:40.370 region:rollup2
PROTECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION AND

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:42.339 region:rollup2
IT INCENTIVIZE THEM TO ACT LIKE

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:43.173 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPANIES

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:45.242 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY DO PROTECT

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:47.110 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S INFORMATION.

00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:48.445 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IT DOES IS IF

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:50.280 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BY ADEQUATE IDENTITY

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:52.683 region:rollup2
THEFT PROTECTION.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.918 region:rollup2
THEN IT STARS THE DATA THIEVES.

00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:56.620 region:rollup2
THEY THE THIEVES LIKE ANY FEE.

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:58.188 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE PATH LEAST RESISTANCE

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.223 region:rollup2
IF THEY CANNOT PROFIT OFF OF

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:00.257 region:rollup2
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:55:59.223 --> 00:56:02.793 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN STEPS TO

00:56:00.257 --> 00:56:05.162 region:rollup2
PROTECT YOURSELF.

00:56:02.793 --> 00:56:08.232 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT WILL DECREASE.

00:56:05.162 --> 00:56:08.832 region:rollup2
PETER UP PLEASE I ABSOLUTELY AND

00:56:08.232 --> 00:56:09.933 region:rollup2
THEN THE LAST PIECE OF IS THE

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:11.501 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION.

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:13.303 region:rollup2
PORTION OF IT THE NOTIFICATION

FURTHER NOT GONNA PREVENT DATA

00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:16.153 region:rollup2
BREACHES BUSINESSES ALREADY HAVE

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.254 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVES TO AVOID

00:59:16.153 --> 00:59:19.022 region:rollup2
DATA BREACHES IN THESE INCLUDE

00:59:17.254 --> 00:59:20.357 region:rollup2

CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW --

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:38.942 region:rollup2
IN THE WAKE OF A BRIDGE AGAIN

00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:43.246 region:rollup2
THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:44.247 region:rollup2
A POP RIGHT THERE AS WE HEARD.

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:45.682 region:rollup2
ONE THE OTHER THING THIS BILL IS

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.783 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA HELP THOSE WHO ARE

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:48.051 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY INJURED DUE TO A DATA

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:49.953 region:rollup2
BREACH OF S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:50.854 region:rollup2
ONCE ADOPTED A CONSUMER CLAIMS

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.855 region:rollup2

INTO EARLY CLASS ACTION

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:54.157 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS.

00:59:52.923 --> 00:59:55.292 region:rollup2
SO IF THE CONSUMER DOES SUFFER

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:55.859 region:rollup2
AN INJURY AT A LATER DATE

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:56.960 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITHOUT

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.429 region:rollup2
NO ONE FINAL POINT I WANT TO

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.269 region:rollup2
ENCRYPTION IS DEFINITELY

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:08.505 region:rollup2
STRONGER PROTECTION BUT IT'S NOT

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:10.440 region:rollup2
IRON CLAD YOU CAN HAVE --

01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:11.007 region:rollup2
BROUGH A BREACH THAT RESULTS IN

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.511 region:rollup2
THE DECRYPTION OF DATA DO TO

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:15.145 region:rollup2
ASSIST TICKET CRIMINAL --

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.379 region:rollup2
COULD BE AN ERROR BY AN EMPLOYEE

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:18.281 region:rollup2
--

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.217 region:rollup2
OFTEN DATA IS IN TRANSIT AND

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.585 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CRYPTIC AT THAT TIME --

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.219 region:rollup2
AND SO COMPANY THAT GOES OUT

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.554 region:rollup2

ENCRYPTION AND THEN ULTIMATELY

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
FACES A BREACH THEY'RE GOING TO

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:28.692 region:rollup2

CYBERCRIME.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.706 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA PREVENT DATA BREACHES

TIMELY SOCIETAL ISSUE.

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:03.960 region:rollup2
THAT IS IMPORTANT EVERYONE ON A

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:05.362 region:rollup2

ON AND THEY'RE LEGITIMATELY

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:13.069 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TO DO --

01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:14.137 region:rollup2
THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:15.338 region:rollup2

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.614 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION OF THOSE WERE

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:26.416 region:rollup2
PREACHING TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:28.485 region:rollup2

IDENTIFIED UNDER THIS BILL.

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:36.860 region:rollup2
ON THERE IS A PLETHORA OF

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.928 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT THIS

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.664 region:rollup2
TREND IS GOING TO CONTINUE WE'RE

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:41.198 region:rollup2

SOLVE IT.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:45.769 region:rollup2
ON AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.670 region:rollup2
THAT NOW THE CRIMINALS ARE

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:50.507 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY GOING AFTER SMALL

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:51.975 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES 43% OF THE TIME.

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:52.676 region:rollup2
IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ATTACKS ARE

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:55.045 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED SMALL

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:56.146 region:rollup2
BUSINESS --

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.814 region:rollup2
THE US NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY

01:01:56.146 --> 01:02:00.317 region:rollup2
LANCE FOUND THAT 6% OF SMALL

01:01:57.814 --> 01:02:01.685 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ARE UNABLE.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:02.218 region:rollup2
STAYING THERE BUSINESS SIX

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:03.853 region:rollup2
MONTHS AFTER A CYBERCRIME

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:05.755 region:rollup2
ATTACK.

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:07.724 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:09.459 region:rollup2
IS AN ISSUE.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.427 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION REALLY BECOMES IS

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:13.296 region:rollup2
SUING.

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:15.231 region:rollup2
ARM A THE WAY TO SOLVE THE ISSUE

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:17.400 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE A

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.602 region:rollup2
HAMMER EVERYTHING DOES START TO

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.136 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE A NAIL EVENTUALLY

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:20.604 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO SUE

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.705 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:23.940 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT --

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.844 region:rollup2
COURSE OF LITIGATION IS THAT?

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:29.813 region:rollup2
COM CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WHILE

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:32.315 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T ALWAYS CIVIC WE

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:34.818 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THAT MUCH OF CONSUMERS

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:36.019 region:rollup2
ARE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE ALL

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:37.787 region:rollup2
RECEIVED THOSE.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:39.689 region:rollup2
ON NOTICES IN THE MAIL THAT

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:41.024 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT YOU KNOW

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.493 region:rollup2
EX COUPON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:44.394 region:rollup2
OUT OF A OUT OF A A A CLASS

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:46.263 region:rollup2
ACTION.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:47.430 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENT REALLY COMES DOWN

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.566 region:rollup2
TO DOES IT THE TO HER.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:51.668 region:rollup2
AND WHY I'M HERE TESTIFYING IN

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.235 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE I THINK

01:02:51.668 --> 01:02:54.638 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR THERE'S ALREADY.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:58.341 region:rollup2
FROM LARGE AMOUNT OF DETERRENCE

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:59.676 region:rollup2
ON THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:01.044 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SURVEY THAT SHOWS THAT

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:04.381 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY ANY DAY TO BE

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:04.981 region:rollup2
BREACH ALREADY COST THE VICTIM.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:05.982 region:rollup2
WHICH IS OR TALK ABOUT WE'RE

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.516 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:10.520 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:11.454 region:rollup2
ATTACKED CREE ON A AN AVERAGE OF

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.556 region:rollup2
THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:16.693 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ON IN THERE EQUIFAX

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:18.428 region:rollup2
LAWSUIT WHICH IS ON THE A YOU

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:19.963 region:rollup2
KNOW SORT OF THE STATED.

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:22.232 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE MAIN STATED --

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:23.033 region:rollup2
MOTIVATORS OF THE BILL THEIR

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:25.602 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE CLASS ACTION

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:27.737 region:rollup2
LAWSUITS AGAINST A EQUIFAX I'M

01:03:25.602 --> 01:03:29.072 region:rollup2
THEY DROPPED. TWO BILLION

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:31.107 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN MARKET SHARE THE DAY

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:32.809 region:rollup2
AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THIS IS

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:35.245 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT COMPANIES ALREADY

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.746 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY --

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.681 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:39.816 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THAT THIS IS A BLUNT

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:42.052 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:43.787 region:rollup2

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:46.923 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HOW

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:48.491 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THE DATA THAT'S PREACHED

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.192 region:rollup2
IS AND WHAT THE PENALTY SHOULD

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.027 region:rollup2
BE.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:53.029 region:rollup2
ON IT ACCUMULATES --

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:55.498 region:rollup2
IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT BECAUSE

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:58.334 region:rollup2
IT HITS EVERYBODY IF YOU TAKE A

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.635 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE BOMB THERE BEEN

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.437 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

SEVENTEEN NOTICED.

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:03.606 region:rollup2
DATA BREACHES IN CALIFORNIA

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:05.008 region:rollup2
SINCE I TESTIFIED THIS ON THIS

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:06.276 region:rollup2
IN THE SENATE THAT INCLUDES THE

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.343 region:rollup2
BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:09.012 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:10.680 region:rollup2
I'M WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:12.148 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES --

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.817 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ENTITIES --

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:16.553 region:rollup2
AND SO ON IT'S A BLUNT

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:20.390 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT BECAUSE I'M IT DOES

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:22.192 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOW ON EH HELP PEOPLE

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.660 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:52.709 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE IN THIS TOPIC

01:06:51.441 --> 01:06:54.110 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO NOVEMBER I HAD

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.812 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ABOUT THE INTERSECTION

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.313 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THAT MEASURE AND YOUR

01:06:55.812 --> 01:07:00.517 region:rollup2
BILL COULD YOU GO INTO THAT JUST

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:03.186 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A SENSE.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.753 region:rollup2
IF IT HAPPENS TO PASS.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.321 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I HAVE

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:07.090 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.757 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MY WITNESSES

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.358 region:rollup2
COULD --

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.660 region:rollup2
OPINED ON THAT I HAVEN'T SPENT

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:12.328 region:rollup2
MUCH TIME.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.930 region:rollup2
NOT YET IT THERE IS OVERLAP AND

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:15.498 region:rollup2
AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN COME

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.367 region:rollup2
AUGUST OR LATER.

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:18.968 region:rollup2
IN THE YEAR THERE IS --

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.937 region:rollup2
CHATTERING OUT AMENDMENTS THAT

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:22.505 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE WITH THIS BILL SOME

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:24.140 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WOULD BE IT EASY.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:26.309 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE FIX TO THIS BILL THAT

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.378 region:rollup2

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:29.746 region:rollup2
THAT BALLOT MEASURE PASSED AND

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.947 region:rollup2
THEN THIS WOULD BE AFFECTED AND

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:33.750 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE CURIOUSLY BUT

01:07:30.947 --> 01:07:35.418 region:rollup2
THERE IS OVERLAP --

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:39.355 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:41.257 region:rollup2
pVERY MUCH APPRECATE THE AUTHOR

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.759 region:rollup2
AND YOUR SUPPORTERS I THINK FOR

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:44.227 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:45.728 region:rollup2
KNOW NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.663 region:rollup2
WE WE WE KNOW ABOUT THIS DATA

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:49.065 region:rollup2
BREACHES.

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:52.835 region:rollup2
OF THEIR CATASTROPHIC --

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:57.006 region:rollup2
AND I I I I I WAS THE BEEN

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:59.342 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO THE MARKET ALONE --

01:07:57.006 --> 01:08:00.243 region:rollup2
IS ENOUGH CLEARLY IT HAS NOT

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:02.445 region:rollup2
PROVEN TO BE ENOUGH I THINK WE

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:04.414 region:rollup2
NEED MORE WE NEED MORE FOR

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:05.481 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE --

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.983 region:rollup2
TO TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS THAT

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:08.451 region:rollup2
BEING SAID I'M STILL THINKING

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:09.285 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS PRECISELY

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.420 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT BALANCE MY

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.521 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THIS BILL IS

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.855 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO TO PRIVACY IN THAT

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:14.857 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO GO TO THE FLOOR.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:16.159 region:rollup2
AND I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.160 region:rollup2
TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:08:16.159 --> 01:08:18.695 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE CONVERSATION

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.829 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE THAT BEEN SAID

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:21.397 region:rollup2
LOOKING FORWARD TO AMENDMENTS

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:22.332 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW BEING DISCUSSED.

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:24.233 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND FOR

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.401 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:27.103 region:rollup2
WORK ON THIS THIS IS HARD.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.972 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:30.039 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND AND

01:08:28.972 --> 01:08:31.507 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY --

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:33.710 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THE RIGHT ANSWER

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:34.711 region:rollup2
IS DOING NOTHING UP WE HAVE TO

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.912 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING THE QUESTION IS

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:38.581 region:rollup2
EXACTLY HOW IT STRUCK THAT SO.

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:39.215 region:rollup2
OUT WITH THAT A I WILL BE

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:39.649 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING MOVING THIS BILL OUT

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:46.389 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:48.257 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER KALRA.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:49.058 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CENTER.

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:51.294 region:rollup2
FOR BRING THIS BOARD IS DEATHLY

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:53.096 region:rollup2
A TOUGH ISSUE TO TAKE ON AND AND

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.497 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN.

01:08:53.096 --> 01:08:55.965 region:rollup2
FROM MANY IN THE BUSINESS

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.866 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND AND I APPRECIATE

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.767 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT CHANGED ME WITH SOME OF

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:59.802 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:08:57.767 --> 01:09:01.004 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BILL AS WELL ABOUT IT

01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:02.372 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE.

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:04.040 region:rollup2
THOSE A MENTION THAT.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:06.676 region:rollup2
IT ONLY APPLIES TO COMPANIES WHO

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.112 region:rollup2
DO NOT ENCRYPT REDACT DATA.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:10.480 region:rollup2
AND SO A LOT OF MENTION AS

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:12.181 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES A CASE OF FOCUS ALSO

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.382 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESS YEAR SMALL DISNEY

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:14.817 region:rollup2
HURT.

01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:15.918 region:rollup2
BUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A LEASE

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.552 region:rollup2
RETAIL.

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:20.857 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES --

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:22.358 region:rollup2
EVEN DOWN THE HALL TO THE COFFEE

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:23.793 region:rollup2
SHOP HERE THEY HAD THE YOU SWIPE

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:24.494 region:rollup2
YOUR CARD OR SOMETIMES THEY HAD

01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:27.196 region:rollup2
TO SQUARE.

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:29.732 region:rollup2
IS THAT ENCRYPTED.

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:31.000 region:rollup2
YES IT'S ENCRYPTED AND AND THERE

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:34.003 region:rollup2
ARE FEDERAL LAWS THAT GOVERN

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.138 region:rollup2
CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND AND

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:35.705 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESSES FOLLOW

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:36.906 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:38.441 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THE THE ONES THAT

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:40.510 region:rollup2
DON'T FOLLOW THEM ARE THE VERY

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:41.844 region:rollup2
VERY LARGE COMPANIES TARGET AND

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.046 region:rollup2
HOME DEPOT HAD A PROBLEM WITH

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:45.114 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE.

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
SHOCKINGLY NOT FOLLOWING --

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:48.384 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW WITH REGARD --

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:50.219 region:rollup2
TO PROCESSING CREDIT CARDS SMALL

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:52.288 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES OUTSOURCE ALL OF THAT

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.655 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT ENDS UP BEING TAKEN

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:55.525 region:rollup2
CARE OF ANYWAY.

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:56.793 region:rollup2
AND THE AS IT SHOULD BE.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:58.895 region:rollup2
AND SO I AND I MENTION THAT

01:09:56.793 --> 01:09:59.128 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MOST

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.963 region:rollup2
COMMON.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:02.331 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVE FOR AT LEAST BE

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:04.233 region:rollup2
TELL PURPOSES OFF THE SHELF

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:05.201 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS ARE ENCRYPTED WITH YOU

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:07.203 region:rollup2
GET IT TO OTHERS NAPA PRODUCT

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.439 region:rollup2
ANOTHER KIND A PRODUCT THAT'S

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MOST COMMONLY USED --

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:12.241 region:rollup2
BEFORE RETAIL PURPOSES NOW

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:14.610 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE OTHER.

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:15.745 region:rollup2
AREAS IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:17.180 region:rollup2
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.381 region:rollup2
RELEVANT AS WELL AND SO THERE

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.249 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A BURDEN.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.318 region:rollup2
AYE ON ALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:23.619 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE --

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:25.188 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DOING

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.422 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:27.223 region:rollup2
THE DATA I THINK ULTIMATELY

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:29.859 region:rollup2
COMES DOWN [inaudible]

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:31.194 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:33.162 region:rollup2
IF AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY MY

01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:34.530 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE NO --

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:35.631 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHO SHOULD THE OWNERS

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.567 region:rollup2
BEYOND AND WHO'S IN THE BEST

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:38.901 region:rollup2
POSITION.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:41.170 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE DATA IS THAT THE

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:43.239 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER OR IS THAT

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:46.008 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY BIGGER SMALL --

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:48.511 region:rollup2
I ALSO AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:50.379 region:rollup2
THAT I I YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:52.081 region:rollup2
WHAT IS TRYING TO BE DONE I DO

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:53.616 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THERE'S GONNA BE MORE

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.218 region:rollup2
WORK DONE ON THE BILL.

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:56.953 region:rollup2
OPTICALLY AS GOES IN FLORIDA AT

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:59.222 region:rollup2
LEAST ONE OR TWO OTHER

01:10:56.953 --> 01:11:00.823 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES BEFORE GOES THE FOR

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:01.324 region:rollup2

THE SENATE BUT SATISFY

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:04.827 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I'M

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:07.230 region:rollup2
REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS ARE POSITIVE.

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:09.265 region:rollup2
INTO A DEAL WITH SOME OF THE

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.200 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I THINK ARE LEGITIMATE

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:12.568 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FROM THE OF THE VARIOUS

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.803 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INTERESTS BUT I THINK

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:17.306 region:rollup2
THE UNDERLYING.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:21.077 region:rollup2
GOAL HERE IS A OF IS NOT ONE THE

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:23.846 region:rollup2
MARKET BY ITSELF WILL CORRECT --

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:26.482 region:rollup2
FOR I AND I DO THINK.

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:27.784 region:rollup2
GEISHAS BETTER PLACED UPON THOSE

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.552 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ACTUALLY.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:31.354 region:rollup2
BARRETT NOW THAT BEING SAID I

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.455 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:33.222 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:35.324 region:rollup2
THAT WERE RAISED BY THE

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:36.325 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THAT AGAIN I'LL LOOK

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:38.161 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:39.829 region:rollup2
TO AMENDMENTS AND AND YOU KNOW

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:41.597 region:rollup2

THE AUTHORS LAWS THAT THAT THE

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:45.668 region:rollup2
NEXT COMMITTEES GOES FORWARD SO

TODAY BUT I'M OF THE AYE AGAIN

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.640 region:rollup2
AS I AM.

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:52.308 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS TO INDICATE WILL

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.244 region:rollup2
BE INCIDENTS SEEING WHAT

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:56.746 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT SELDOM OCCUR BUT

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.748 region:rollup2
BEFORE BECAUSE OF FLOOR.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:00.483 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ISRAEL'S.

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:02.018 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR I AGREE WITH

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:03.085 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WITHOUT A

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.986 region:rollup2
DOUBT IT WOULDN'T THERE ARE

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.622 region:rollup2
BREACHES.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:08.057 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE VICTIMS I DISAGREE

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:08.624 region:rollup2
THAT THE VICTIM.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.293 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE BUSINESS IT IS A

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:12.228 region:rollup2
CONSUMER.

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:12.962 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHO AT EIGHT IN MY

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:14.130 region:rollup2
OPINION WHO WE DO NEED TO

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:17.934 region:rollup2
PROTECT [inaudible]

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:19.001 region:rollup2
BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:21.470 region:rollup2
COULD BE PERCEIVED AS AN OVER

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.805 region:rollup2
REACH IT'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:23.840 region:rollup2
TO BE RESOLVED.

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:26.475 region:rollup2
ó WE DO NEED TO PROTECT THOSE

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.044 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS --

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:29.612 region:rollup2
BUT PERHAPS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.947 region:rollup2
MORE I'M GLAD I SIT IN PRIVACY

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:32.648 region:rollup2
SO I DO GET TO SEE YOUR YOUR

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:35.318 region:rollup2
NEXT AMENDMENTS.

01:12:32.648 --> 01:12:36.786 region:rollup2
AND I I AGREE THERE WERE SOME

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:38.521 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD POINTS BROUGHT UP BY

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:41.457 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION THAT I THINK WE

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.891 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED TO TAKE AGAIN I'M

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:44.760 region:rollup2
SURE THAT YOU HAVE.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:46.996 region:rollup2
TAKE A LONG LOOK AT THOSE --

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.565 region:rollup2
TO BE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO DOES

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:51.534 region:rollup2
NOT CAUSE ADDITIONAL HARM I KNOW

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:52.735 region:rollup2
THAT JUST RECENTLY HERE IN

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:54.971 region:rollup2
JUDICIARY.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:56.739 region:rollup2
WE DID VOTE ON A ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:58.140 region:rollup2
TODAY AT CHURCH AT CHAO'S THE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:13:00.376 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.777 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THIRTY DAYS TO REPAIR

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.212 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE IS A BREACH THEN YOU

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:05.681 region:rollup2
HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO TAKE CARE OF

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:06.349 region:rollup2
IT OTHERWISE THEN THERE THERE IS

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:07.483 region:rollup2
A LIABILITY.

01:13:06.349 --> 01:13:08.885 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:11.554 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO SEE AS WE MOVE

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:13.389 region:rollup2
FORWARD INTO PRIVACY BUT I DO

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.990 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:14.690 region:rollup2
FOR TAKING CARE TO MAKE SURE

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:17.793 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:20.196 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE WHO.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.730 region:rollup2
HOW OF THIS INFORMATION?

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:23.399 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALLOW A. B. DATA

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.100 region:rollup2
BREACH.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.668 region:rollup2
THEY DO NEED TO BE HELD

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.304 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE WITHOUT A DOUBT.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:32.208 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE CONSUMERS SHOULD

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:35.144 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF OF

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:36.712 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S ERROR --

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:38.214 region:rollup2
THE EXAMPLE GIVEN OF A COMPUTER

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:40.249 region:rollup2
BEING STOLEN OBVIOUSLY THAT

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:41.617 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.852 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO IN THE BILL.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.687 region:rollup2
BUT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:46.155 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND I TO OUT TODAY WILL

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:47.823 region:rollup2
BE SUPPORTING THAT AND DO LOOK

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:50.693 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT COMES --

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:52.828 region:rollup2
IN PRIVACY [inaudible]

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:54.530 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:55.998 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:58.100 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TO BE SET ON THIS BILL

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.568 region:rollup2
IN THIS AREA IT'S A VERY COMPLEX

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.836 region:rollup2
AREA AND IN FACT FOR THE SIX

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:02.171 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.906 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE ISSUES LIKE THIS

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:05.508 region:rollup2
COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.776 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND THEY'RE ALWAYS

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.477 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS THAT.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.346 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY SCREAMS THAT THAT

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:12.048 region:rollup2
CONSUMER EIGHT OR ORGANIZATIONS

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:13.582 region:rollup2
TRY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS PUT ON

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:15.818 region:rollup2
THE TABLE AND WHAT'S REALLY BEEN

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:17.753 region:rollup2
MISSING IS THE INDUSTRY

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:18.921 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN THIS.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.189 region:rollup2
THEY'RE OPPOSED ANYTHING THAT

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:21.624 region:rollup2
THAT GETS ATTEMPT AT AND I THINK

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.591 region:rollup2
YOU'RE VULNERABLE TO ALL OF

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:23.693 region:rollup2
THESE ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO DO

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:25.094 region:rollup2
SOMETHING INCLUDING A STATEWIDE

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.962 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:29.098 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:30.967 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN LOOK THAT.

01:14:29.098 --> 01:14:34.236 region:rollup2
AS AS A WAY TO SOLVE ALL OF

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:35.471 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES AND THERE'S A

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.605 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF THINGS INTERNET AND

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.606 region:rollup2
CENTER APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:37.907 region:rollup2
NEVER THIS TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.408 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:41.410 region:rollup2
ENCRYPTING.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:43.846 region:rollup2
OR REDACTING INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:45.748 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE OF THE CORE ISSUES

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:47.850 region:rollup2
MOSTLY TRANSACTIONS NOW THAT

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:49.452 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AND AND ARE ENCRYPTED

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup2
OR SHOULD BE AND IF THEY'RE NOT.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:51.721 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED THAT THROUGH

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.455 region:rollup2
THE TARGET BREACH IN THROUGH

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:54.223 region:rollup2
THROUGH OTHER BRIDGES THAT'S

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:56.359 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE TO DO

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:58.794 region:rollup2
EVEN AT THAT AT THE CONSUMER

01:14:56.359 --> 01:15:01.864 region:rollup2
READ AND SO THE FACT THAT.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:03.933 region:rollup2
UNENCRYPTED DATA IS MOVING.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:05.167 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONING BETWEEN FROM ONE

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:06.268 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO THE NACS WHATEVER

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
THOSE SYSTEMS HAPPEN TO BE IS

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:09.105 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:11.207 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:12.174 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR NOW I

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:13.309 region:rollup2
REALLY TO WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:14.410 region:rollup2
OF SOME THESE THINGS ON THE

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.911 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:16.946 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES TYPICALLY THE

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:18.381 region:rollup2
LARGER THE BUSINESS THE MORE

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:20.016 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAT THEY HAVE CONTROL

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:21.350 region:rollup2
OVER THEIR ENTIRE PROCESS AND

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.385 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE GONNA OWN THE

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.953 region:rollup2
SERVERS OR IF NOT THE COULD HAVE

01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:25.421 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT TROLL OVER THE

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:26.822 region:rollup2
SERVERS AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE.

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:28.324 region:rollup2
A SMALLER BUSINESS IS JUST

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:30.025 region:rollup2
HOSTING THEIR WEBSITE WHERE

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:31.794 region:rollup2
THEIR DATABASE ESSENTIALLY ON

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:32.661 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ELSE'S SERVER THAT

01:15:31.794 --> 01:15:35.765 region:rollup2
SERVER COULD BE POTENTIALLY

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:37.466 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE IF THERE'S A NOTHER.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:38.701 region:rollup2
DATABASE OR WEBSITE HOSTED ON

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:40.336 region:rollup2
THAT SERVER THAT IS NOT BEING

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.871 region:rollup2
KEPT UP TO DATE THAT IT DOESN'T

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.172 region:rollup2
HAVE APPROPRIATE CORRUPTION.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.706 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT PROVIDES OFTENTIMES

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:45.474 region:rollup2
AT ENTRY INTO THAT ENTIRE

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:47.143 region:rollup2
SERVER.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.744 region:rollup2
SO IF SOMEONE HASN'T MAINTAINED

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:50.212 region:rollup2
THEIR SOFTWARE HASN'T RUN

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:52.148 region:rollup2
PATCHES HASN'T KEPT UP WITH IT

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:54.083 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE.

01:15:52.148 --> 01:15:55.284 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES TO

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.452 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WHO'S RESIDENT ON THAT

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:58.521 region:rollup2
SERVER NOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:15:56.452 --> 01:16:00.089 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:15:58.521 --> 01:16:02.525 region:rollup2
AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:03.159 region:rollup2
THE EYES P. SAFE NOT US DUH

01:16:02.525 --> 01:16:05.361 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:06.796 region:rollup2
STATE NOT US THE SMALL

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:09.365 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ONCE A NOT AS AND IT.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:11.200 region:rollup2
IT'S ALWAYS NOT US WELL THEN WHO

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:13.035 region:rollup2
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.603 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS BREACH

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:16.272 region:rollup2
HAS CAUSED THESE DAMAGES TO A

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:17.606 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CONSUMER JUST THE

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:19.775 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THEY HAVE THAT THOSE

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:20.643 region:rollup2
STRESS THE PANIC.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.477 region:rollup2
HAVING TO GO THROUGH.

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:22.912 region:rollup2
A CREDIT CHECK HAVING TO GO

01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:24.580 region:rollup2
THROUGH A PROTECT.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:25.848 region:rollup2
THEIR INFORMATION EVEN IF THEIR

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.450 region:rollup2
IDENTITY HAD HAS NOT YET BEEN

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:29.518 region:rollup2
STOLEN.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:30.953 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOME BUT THAT IS

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:32.822 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DAMAGES THAT THAT

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.823 region:rollup2
MAY OR MAY NOT RISE TO THE TO

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:34.457 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE CONCERNED

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:36.492 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:38.227 region:rollup2
AND WENT ONE PARTICULAR

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:39.862 region:rollup2
DATABASES BREACHED THAT'S A

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:41.063 region:rollup2
SUBSET OF INFORMATION.

01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:43.232 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER DATABASE

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.600 region:rollup2
THAT GETS BREACH THAT THAT ADDS

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:46.769 region:rollup2
TO THE ABILITY ESPECIALLY WITH

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.104 region:rollup2
DATA AGGREGATORS TO THEN GO IN

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.605 region:rollup2
AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:52.074 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ENOUGH TO PUT PIECES

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:55.444 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO THEN BE ABLE TO GO.

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:56.679 region:rollup2
AND AND GET A CREDIT CARD IN

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:58.214 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY'S NAME THE TAX SOCIAL

01:16:56.679 --> 01:17:00.249 region:rollup2
SECURITY NUMBER BECAUSE WITH

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:01.050 region:rollup2
THAT COMBINATION OF DATA FROM

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.685 region:rollup2
TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES NOW THEY

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.386 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH.

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.554 region:rollup2
SO WHO'S THAT RESPONSIBLE WAS

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:07.323 region:rollup2
THE FIRST BREACH WAS AT THE

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.858 region:rollup2
SECOND GRADE THIS BECOMES VERY

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:09.091 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT SO UNTIL WE REALLY

01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:12.228 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:13.863 region:rollup2
HAD A A BROADER SOLUTION TO THIS

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:14.964 region:rollup2
THAN.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:16.532 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE LEFT WITH TRYING

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.133 region:rollup2
TO SORT OUT THE BEST WE CAN DO

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:19.335 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXACTLY THIS WHICH ARE

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.736 region:rollup2
BILLS LIKE THIS AND TRY TO SET

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:22.805 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT.

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:24.473 region:rollup2
DOING SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS OF

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:26.008 region:rollup2
THE DATA THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.910 region:rollup2
FOR FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS THEN YES

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:29.278 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT BE ON THE HOOK FOR

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:31.213 region:rollup2
STATUTORY DAMAGES FOR IT.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:33.149 region:rollup2
AND AND IF THAT DOESN'T CHANGE

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:34.583 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR A I'M NOT SURE WHAT

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.118 region:rollup2
ELSE WELL.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:38.087 region:rollup2
ON THAT JUST BRIEFLY ON THE

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:39.855 region:rollup2
CHAPTER AND OUT THE THAT DOESN'T

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.923 region:rollup2
CHAPTER GOD AMENDMENTS GET DONE

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.391 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S A CONFLICT BETWEEN

01:17:40.923 --> 01:17:43.559 region:rollup2
BILLS SO IF YOU WOULD DO YOU

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.793 region:rollup2
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THIS

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:46.295 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD INTERACT WITH THE

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:47.863 region:rollup2
BALLOT MEASURE SHOULD IT PASSED.

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:49.598 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN IN

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:50.566 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OR ON THE FLOOR THOSE

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:51.600 region:rollup2
ARE NOT AMENDMENTS THERE CAN BE

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:53.903 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH IN CHAPTER GAPS I

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.137 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THE HOUSES LOOKS A

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.872 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURES THAN

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
AND CONFLICTS THERE.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO DRIVE CHAPTER AND

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:03.279 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE JUST AS A IT'S WELL

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.747 region:rollup2
WORTH LOOKING AT IS THE

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.348 region:rollup2
INTERPLAY BETWEEN THOSE.

01:18:04.747 --> 01:18:09.118 region:rollup2
TWO AND WHETHER THERE'S COMPLETE

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:10.686 region:rollup2
COVERAGE OR NOT I SO FOR ME THIS

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:12.855 region:rollup2
BILL SATISFIED THIS COMMITTEE I

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:14.590 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TO OTHERS.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:15.624 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS THE WORRY

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:16.892 region:rollup2
IN THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.459 region:rollup2
RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND FOR

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:21.130 region:rollup2
OTHERS BUT IF NOT THIS THAN

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:22.665 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:23.999 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF IF NOT NOW HOW HOW

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:26.468 region:rollup2
ELSE DO WE PROCESS IS HOW DO WE

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:29.438 region:rollup2
HAD TO PROVIDE.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.438 region:rollup2
SOME SECURITY FOR CUSTOMERS THAT
