THE GO. AND YOU KNOW HE FROM THE DIRECTIVE CAL RECYCLING THAT. THE ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY AT EIGHT AM IS THE E. J. SCHOOL GROUNDS PROGRAM. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS TO HAVE THAT REALLY SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART I'M IT'S AN INCREDIBLY. EFFECTIVE DROP PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS A WIDE VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR TOUGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES. IT SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON FUNDING PROJECTS MAKING THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE. FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND AT THE MONTREUX COBIT NINETEEN FOR THIS PROGRAM ASSEMBLY INCREASED IN TWENTY TWENTY THE PROGRAM APPLICANTS REQUESTED FULL MILLION. IN GRANT FUND THING WITH ANY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN FUNDS TO DISTRIBUTE. THE CROWD SO WHAT IT DID LAST YEAR FUNDED PROJECTS RANGING FROM IMPLEMENTING YOU CHEMICAL EXPOSURE AND CUT WITH NINETEEN SAFETY MEASURES AND NAIL SALON WORKERS TO ENGAGING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ACROSS CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.

DIDN'T BUT THEN IT COMMUNITY IT'S INTEREST WE FIND CUTTING RITA EXAMINING BATH AND MENTAL HEALTH I'M TAKING MY MOTHERS AND FAMILIES IN FRESNO AND AT THE TIME WHEN OUT FRONT LINE WORKERS HAVE SHOWN HOW CRITICAL ESSENTIAL AND VULNERABLE THEY CAN OFTEN BE WE OFTEN FUNDED INDIGENOUS LED ORGANIZATIONS TO SHOW THAT HEALTH AND OTHER SAFETY INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED IN NON ENGLISH INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE SPEAKING TO A DEGREE FOR FIELD WORKERS THAT IS THE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE PROGRAM TO LIVE WITH EACH YEAR. PRIVATE FUNDING SOURCES OF THIS PROGRAM HAVE GENERALLY BEEN PENALTY FUNDS INCLUDING WAY FOR THE DISCHARGE APPLICATION CONTROL FUNDS IN SOME SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT TOSCA FUNDS AND BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM FUNDING SOURCES OF ALL SAYS TAMAL LIMITED EXTENT SUPPORTED THE PROGRAM IDEALLY WE WANT TO VARIETY OF PENALTY OR GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PROGRAM AGAIN IN THE LIGHT OF CURRENT DEMANDS ON THE APPLICATION CONTROL AND WASTE WATER DISCHARGE FUNDS TO FILL BUDGET SHORTFALL.

CAN REDUCE SOCIETY IT'S REALLY I WOULD GOT WHACKED WE WORK COLLABORATIVE WITH USE OF I WANT TO YOU AND IT. FOR THAT WELL CAN FEEL PARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE- DO WE HAVE A- FROM THE L. A. O. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE HERE IS HOW RELATED TO THE FUNDING SOURCE- AS WITH MENTIONS THE PROPOSED BAN SOURCES TOSCO ACCOUNT WE DO THINK. ABOUT THAT IS AN ALLOWABLE FUND SOURCE AND THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FUNDS IF THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED GSE REFORM PROPOSAL- HOWEVER WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AS A SECRETARY. MENTIONED IN THE PAST- A MIX OF DIFFERENT SPECIAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER SOURCES TO FIND THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. ARE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLORE THAT- THIS TIME AROUND AS WELL AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON YOUR STAFF TO KIND OF IDENTIFY. THE OPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BINANCE ZERO EIGHT APARTMENT OF FINANCE. AT THIS TIME THAT HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT- LET ME ASK A QUESTION AND- THE- REBALANCING OF THIS FUND IS DEPENDENT ON THE HAVE A REFORM PLAN TO REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE WHICH IS A PRETTY. A STEEP CLIMB IN THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES. BOB IS THERE A- CONTINGENCY PLANS. IF THE FEE REFORM PROPOSAL DOESN'T COME TO FRUITION. JOINING CHAIR AT NJ MARCH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT IN OUR PROPOSAL THIS YEAR WE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF TIME LAST YEAR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WHAT LEARNED- THE LOOKING FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR AND- AND GETTING REFORM PASSED. WELL OKAY- AND- NOT REALLY IN A PLACE TO SHARE YOUR ENTHUSIASM AND I THINK THAT'S BASED ON THE HISTORY LEADING UP TO THIS- UP TO THIS POINT IN TERMS OF- THOUGH THE WAY THIS FUND WHICH I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL IS A- EXCELLENT FUND. AND USE FOR MANY MANY IMPORTANT PURPOSES AND IT'S VERY EFFICIENTLY- HUH UTILIZED BUT- EITHER WAY WE HAVE- PROBE- HAS DONE THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES AS SUCH IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT TO CHALLENGING TOGETHER TO. HOW TO GET THE FEW REFORM THE PROPOSAL PASSED BUT- ARE THERE ANY OTHER- QUESTIONS. ON THIS ITEM. CORRECT- THEN THE- OUR RECOMMENDATION HARRIS- THAT WE OF FUNDERS REQUEST EXCLUSIVELY WITH A DEBT THAT FUNDING REQUEST- WITH TOSCA FUNDS IS BECAUSE INAPPROPRIATE. AND THAT- THERE BE A MORE APPROPRIATE COMBINATION OF FUND SOURCES- OR JUST USE THE GENERAL FUND AND I FRANKLY HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT- I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE MOST DIRECT WAY. OF OF FUNDING THIS RATHER THAN TAKING IT FROM TAKING THE MONEY FROM FUNDS THAT ARE CAN APPROPRIATE- SO THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. WERE BACK FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF- REPORTING ON THE- EXIDE. COST RECOVERY IN RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP THAT- HAS AFFECTED TO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND- LOS ANGELES- LIKE CUT AND NOTHING ELSE IN THIS IN THE STATE IF THE CONTAMINATION ISSUE THAT HAS LASTED NOW FOR A- OF MANY YEARS. AND WAS GLAD TO HEAR SECRETARY BLUMENFELD A SUGGESTED TO OTHER ORGANISMS CHANGES AT THE TSC THAT WILL HELP. MAKE THIS CLEAN UP MORE EFFICIENT AND- MAKE IT HAPPEN MORE RAPIDLY FOR THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN- I WANT TO SAY PATIENTLY WAITING BUT- THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT TONIGHT AND THEY ARE IMPATIENT. AND THEN WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SEE ACTION SO OF- IS SET WILL BE RECEIVING A REPORT FROM. THE DIRECTOR WILLIAMS WITH US.

IS EXTREMELY EFFICIENTLY USE MORE THAN 90% OF THE CLEAN UP FUNDS GO TO PLAY PAY FOR CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. OKAY WE CLEANED UP MORE THAN TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EAST WHICH IS A RATE THAT HAS- CLEANING UP MORE PROPERTIES MORE QUICKLY THAN ANY OTHER RESIDENTIAL THAT BASED. CLEAN UP IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT COULD WORK- BY PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM LED. IN THEIR YARDS- UNDER THE BUDGET CHANGE- A REQUEST- WE ANTICIPATE BEING AROUND TWENTY HUNDRED PROPERTIES BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND- COMPLETING THE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED CLEANUPS ARE BY FAR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO. I WILL NOW WE WANT TO THE CATEGORY B. C. P. JUST SUMMARIZE IT QUICKLY AT THAT REQUEST. AND DINNER IS REQUESTING SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

THANK YOU FOR A FINANCE. GOOD MORNING AND YOUR MARK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME THE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I'M- I'M NOT SURE IF OF MR COPAS. BEST SITUATED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OR FINANCE BUT- I DID I HEAR CORRECTLY THAT- THE- THIRTY TWO HUNDREDS OF PROPERTIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE- QUICKEN THE CLEANING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. THAT'S CORRECT. AND DOES THAT INCLUDE THE PARKWAYS AND- ALL OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THAT ONLY INCLUDES THE RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP PARKWAYS- ARE SEPARATE- ESSENTIALLY SEPARATE PROGRAM FROM THE CLEAN UP THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS. OKAY WEEK ALLOCATED TO I THINK IT WAS SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO- FOR CLEANUP OF THOSE PROPERTIES SO. WHY IS IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S LAGGING BEHIND WHITES THAT. WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT FUNDS CURRENTLY. TO MOVE FORWARD AND ACTUALLY DO THE ANALYSIS NEEDED TO DRIVE- WHAT THE CLEANUPS DATA WOULD BE THAT APPLIES TO THOSE OF PARKWAYS BUT AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS. TO PAY FOR THE ACTUAL CLEANUP OF THE PARK PLACE. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT COST IS GOING TO BE. WITH THE FOR THE REST OF THIS. YEAH THE ATTACHMENTS GOING TO DEPEND UPON THE CLEANUP STANDARDS THAT WE APPLY TO THOSE PARKWAYS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. NOW OF FINALIZING A RISK ASSESSMENT. THAT WILL USE TO DERIVE A CLEANUP STANDARDS. VIAV SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS ADDED TO YOUR BUDGET- IN THAT. FISCAL YEAR- SEVERAL YEARS AGO- AFTER RESIDENTS CAME TO US AND COMPLAINED THAT THE PARKWAYS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM. AND WE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THAT THAT WORK COULD MOVE FORWARD- AND- UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL WHEN YOU COMMENT MAKE A PRESENTATION TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT YOU UPDATE US ON THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY MADE A PRIORITY FOR YOU AND PROVIDED THE FUNDING THAT WAS NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY CHAIRMAN WE- WE ARE STILL USING ALL THE MONEY THAT WE HAD AND CONVERT I'M UP TO THE- YOU KNOW FOR THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS. DUE TO- JUST GO CONSTRAINTS THAT OCCURRED- WHEN THE PANDEMIC CARE. FUNDS THAT WERE NOT ENCUMBERED THE FUNDS THAT WE HADN'T PUT IN THE CONTRACT- WERE WITHDRAWN FROM- ARTILLERY TO USE THEM. ABOUT WE INTEND TO USE ALL THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO DO ALL THE WORK THAT WE CAN- WITHIN THOSE RESOURCES WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT- THINGS HAVE BEEN HELD UP TO THE PANDEMIC- AND SO WHAT I WOULD REQUEST IS WHEN. YOU COME BACK AFTER THE MAY REVISED AND- AND WE FEEL GAP THAT WE HAVE A FULL REPORT ON. THE STATUS OF THE- OF THE PARKWAY PROJECT- IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO. A. A COMPLETING THIS DECONTAMINATION. I THANK YOU. SO SHOULD WE BE EXPECTING A IN THIS THE SCHOOL YEAR- A OF PROPOSAL ASKING FOR RESOURCES TO COVER REMAINING PROPERTIES AND- IF NOT THIS YEAR THEN WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE MAKING THAT REQUEST. TRY THAT DIFFICULTY GETTING UP WITH MUTE- WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED LIKE A LASER ON COMPLETING THE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED CLEAN UP PROPERTIES- THIS YEAR. AND SHOULD BE- REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS BE PROVIDED WE WILL BE EQUALLY AS FOCUSED ON COMPLETING THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED A CLEAN UPS I NEXT YEAR. ON THE CHURCH I KIND OF WORK THAT GOES INTO THAT AND- THE BUDGET I THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE BUDGET. REQUEST REFLECTS THAT. AND I'M ASSUMING- AS A STAFF REPORT TO- INDICATES THAT THE TWENTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR CLOSURE IS NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THE CLOSURE- SO. WHEN WOULD WE ANTICIPATE A REQUEST FOR THAT. SO DTS IS WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH- USEPA WHO'S THE LEAD REGULATORY AGENCIES OVERSEEING THE- FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST'S WORK UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY ORDER- WE ARE WORKING WITH YOUR CPA TO MAKE CERTAIN THE TRUST IS PRIORITIZE ALL THE WORK THAT'S NECESSARY TO- TECH PUBLIC HEALTH- INCOMPLETE NEEDED ACTIONS USING AVAILABLE FUNDS. WE AND HE WAS HE CARE MONITORING THE TRUST EXPENDITURES. AND WHEN WE IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDS- AS AS AS THEY COME UP ON ANY PROJECT THAT AS NEEDED WE WILL YOU KNOW WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION. I THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HOW MUCH IS TOTALLY BEEN RECOVERED FROM EXCITED SO FAR. THE THE DEPARTMENT JUST FILED THE COST RECOVERY. ACTION AGAINST RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF THE FACILITY SO THAT ACTION IS BEING UNDERTAKEN RIGHT NOW. SO WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE OF TAXPAYERS OF MY MATHIS- ANYWHERE CLOSE INFILL SPENT CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. I'M JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH OF WE GOT BACK OUT OF THAT MONEY THAT WE SPENT FOR THE- CITIZENS IN THAT AREA. IN IN JUST A THINKING AS OF PASSED CONTRACTOR YOU HAD THE FUNDING FOR THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE OF IT. YOU HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THE PARK WICKS SIDE OF IT CAN'T WE DO BOTH PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME OR WHY ARE WE WAITING TO DO THE PARKWAY. YEAH WE ARE WORKING CONCURRENTLY ON BOTH RESIDENTIAL CLEAN UP AS WELL AS THE PARK PLACE. OKAY CLEAR FOR THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ORIGINALLY A PARKWAYS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE- AND IN THE PROJECT AND SO THEY HAD TO BE THEY HAD TO BE ADDED IN AND- TO LOSE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF. CATCH UP THAT'S TAKING PLACE THERE. BUT- THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. BUT IF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALL RIGHT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. ALSO WITH THE TSA OF GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL REFORM PACKAGE IN GENERAL FUND BACK FROM. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. RECITED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL TO REVISE UGS HE'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND IT'S FEES IN TO START THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. CALIFORNIANS NEEDED DGSE THAT CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC ARM. ENGAGE CALIFORNIA NEED TO DGSE THAT FUNCTIONS WITH TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND HELP FISCAL STABILITY. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESE CRITICAL NEEDS. THIS REFORM HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING AND IT'S BEEN A TURN OVER THE YEARS FRUSTRATIONS HAVE PERSISTED WITH THE GST HAS MADE STEADY IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR OPENNESS OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THOSE WHO RESEARCH. WE HAVE THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP TEAM IN PLACE NOW. AND WE'RE PREPARED FOR THE CHANGES PUT FORTH IN THE PROPOSAL. COBIT NINETEEN AND OTHER CHALLENGES TOWARD OUR CHANCE FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFORM LAST YEAR. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS THIS YEAR'S OPPORTUNITY SO EVEN MORE PREPARED NOW. THE PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL WHAT PROGRAM SHOULD DGSE BE DELIVER. SECOND OF ALL WHAT FEES. AND REVENUES SUPPORT THOSE SERVICES WHILE THEY DISSENTED DISINCENTIVE BUYS THE USE OF MISMANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. ALSO THIRDLY WHAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BEST SUPPORTS THAT THE BEST FOSTERS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROVIDE STRONGER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR'S IT ESTABLISHES A BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY FORTY TO SET FEES BASED ON APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND LIKE LAST YEAR THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES AN OMBUDSPERSON WHO REPORTS TO THE BOARD. IT HAS BEEN IT HAS A SIMPLIFIED IT UP TO BE UPDATED FEES FOR BOTH OF THE GSES ACCOUNTS WITH THE COMPUTERS. COACH BUT THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT ALL THAT WE LEARNED LAST YEAR PARTICULARLY THROUGH OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON EIGHTY NINE NINE FIVE. WE URGE. WE HEARD CALLS FOR STRONGER ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES A NUMBER FOR. WE HEARD CALLS TO HEED THE LESSONS WE LEARNED IN THE WAKE OF THE EXITE BANKRUPTCY. AND WE HEARD THAT THE STATUS QUO SERVICE LEVELS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO DO WHAT'S EXPECTED OF US. SO IN RESPONSE TO THESE CONCERNS THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL HAS SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES. THOSE DETAILS WERE PROVIDED IN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELEASED JUST YESTERDAY. THE LANGUAGE UPDATES THE FEE STRUCTURES WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN MODIFIED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BUT DOES SO WITH AN APPROACH THAT'S MINDFUL OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND BEEN HIT HARD BY THE PANDEMIC. THE BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES BY SETTING PERMITTING DECISION TIMELINE TO BE REPORTED ON TO THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. IN A HAS STRONGER FINANCIAL ASSURANCE PROVISIONS. IMPORTANTLY THE PROPOSED FEE INCREASES WOULD COVER NOT JUST THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT INCREASE CERTAIN LEVELS OF SERVICE. ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOULD ALLOW US TO START INVESTIGATING THE ESTIMATED BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CONTAMINATED SITES AROUND THE STATE. WOULD ALLOW US TO DO MORE INSPECTIONS AND TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST MORE HAZARDOUS WASTE VIOLATORS IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND IT WOULD FUND A MODERNIZED HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE STATE. HOW ARE ESTIMATES FOR THE WE NEED THE RESOURCES ARE BASED ON THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WE RELEASED IN JANUARY. THAT WORKLOAD ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN IN RESPONSE TO LEGISLATIVE AND STAKEHOLDER REQUESTS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY REGARDING OUR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE FINDINGS OF THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS SHOW WHAT DGSE CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE WHEN GIVEN THE RIGHT RESOURCES. IT PROVIDES THE LONG REQUESTED TRANSPARENCY INTO HOW WE'RE USING OUR RESOURCES BASED ON A SNAPSHOT AT A PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. MIND YOU IT DOES NOT HAVE THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR SPECIFIC BUDGETARY REQUESTS NOR IS IT A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF RESOURCES NEEDED FOR EVERY DGSE STATUTORY AUTHORITY. BUT THE DEEP BUT THE ANALYSIS DOES SHOW THE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN EACH YES HE'S RESPONSIBILITIES AND ITS RESOURCES. THAT MEANS WERE UNABLE TO FULFILL CURRENT MANDATES FOR TAKE ON ANY NEW ACTIVITIES. YOU KNOW THIS IS DOCUMENTS EXAMPLES OF SERVICES DGSE COULD DELIVER WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WE'VE ESTIMATED THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO CLOSE GAPS FOR WHAT WE JUDGE TO BE SOME OF THE HIGHEST STRATEGIC PRIORITIES IN ORDER TO ANSWER THAT FIRST QUESTION OF THE REFORM WHAT SERVICES SHOULD DGSE WEBER. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE ON MORE ENFORCEMENT IN AREAS KNOWN TO HAVE A HIGH RATE OF VIOLATION. HAZARDOUS WASTE TRANSPORTATION JEWELRY CONTAINING METAL HEAVY METALS THAT SOLD TO CHILDREN. WE MUST HAVE RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN OUR FEDERAL DELEGATION OF OUR REQUIRE AFFORD. WE LACK RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL FOUR STEPS OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS GREEN CHEMISTRY REGULATION. AND WE'VE USED OUR EXPERIENCE FROM THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING THE VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURE TO ESTIMATE WHAT'S NEEDED FOR BSP MOVING FORWARD. THESE ESTIMATES SUPPORT DECISIONS ABOUT THE SECOND OF THE THREE QUESTIONS RAISED EARLIER WHAT FEES AND REVENUES ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE DESIRED SERVICE LEVELS. THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS MAKES IT CLEAR THAT DGSE IS HAS THE BALL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A PERFORMANCE DRIVEN CULTURE WE NOW RETOOL ESTABLISH CLEAR METRICS ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN TRACK PROGRESS. THE AVERAGE TIME NEEDED TO ISSUE A PERMIT DECISION IS NOT TWO POINT FIVE YEARS THAT'S DOWN FROM FOUR POINT FIVE YEARS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WE ONLY ISSUED ONE PERMIT DECISION. WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO REFER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY 43% BOTH USEPA JAM THE PARCHMENT OF DEFENSE HAVE LAUDED ARE IMPROVEMENTS ON MANAGING RECORD CLEAN UP SITES AND MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATOR TARGETS FOR THOSE CLEAN UP. WE'RE DOING WELL WITH WHAT WE HAVE AT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE IMPROVE THE DGSE MUST BE COMPLEMENTED BY THE RIGHT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND THE RIGHT RESOURCES FOR FORMING THE TNC CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER WE KNOW THAT THE FACILITIES THAT HANDLE TOXIC MATERIALS ARE LOCATED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING NOT ONLY. EXCESS ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS BUT HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATELY DURING THE CALL THE PANDEMIC. THE CONTAMINATED SITES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP ARE LOCATED IN THE SAME COMMUNITY. IT'S URGENT THAT WE BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP THE SITES AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT EACH YEAR SEES WORK CONTRIBUTES TO AN EX AN EQUITABLE. AFFORDABLE EQUITABLE EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. CREATING JOBS THROUGH CLEANUPS PUTTING WE BACK INTO FOR PRODUCTIVE USE AND CREATING CLIMATE FRIENDLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE PROCESS. LIKE IT OR NOT OUR LIFESTYLES REQUIRE MANY TOXIC CHEMICALS UNTIL THAT CHANGES WE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARMFUL MATERIALS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN MODERN LIFE. IT IS UP TO DATE TSC TO PROTECT AGAINST THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE HARPER FROM THOSE CHEMICALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS TODAY AND CERTAINLY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. AS WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NERI WHO WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT HER PURPLE. REGISTER.

WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE TO SET THE AND FEE RATES THE SITE PERMIT APPEALS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE GSES PERMIT AND REMEDIATION DECISIONS. REVIEW AND APPROVE THE DIRECTOR'S ANNUAL PRIORITIES AND PERFORMANCE METRICS. I WORK WITH THE DIRECTOR TO ESTABLISH A LONG TERM GOALS FOR DGSE PROGRAMS. AND PROVIDING ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THE OMBUDSMAN WOULD RECEIVE AND EVALUATE COMPLAINTS AND SUGGESTIONS REGARDING ANY ACTION PROGRAM OUR POLICY IN THE DEPARTMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE BOARD AN OMBUDSMAN POSITIONS- THESE RESOURCES WOULD SUPPORT- BOARD SUPPORT INCLUDING AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND POSITION SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS ANALYST AND ATTORNEY POSITIONS. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE DOCTOR REALLY WAS REFERRED TO PROVIDE THE STATUTORY LANG- CHANGES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DGSE WITH LONG TERM FISCAL STABILITY IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISION SHE'S ALREADY- PROVIDED TO YOUR DISCUSS WITH YOU I'M IT WOULD- SO THE RATES FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR H. WCN TOSCA TO COVER THE GENERAL FUND BACK FELL. ON THE COSTS NECESSARY FOR THE BOARD MOM BUT SPENT AND- AS AS DR WHIMS INDICATED AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASED LEVELS OF SERVICE THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE WORKLOAD ANALYSES. IT REMINDS ALSO PROVIDES IS THE TIMING OF THE FEE PAYMENTS TO COINCIDE WITH THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES DTS HE'S FINDING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR FEE REVENUES TO BE COLLECTED IN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR AS THE EXPENDITURES ARE APPROPRIATED AND THE FEES ARE SET BY THE BOARD. ON THE VALUE OF THIS IS THAT IT PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT WITH BETTER CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE RESOURCES INTO PREDICT REVENUES. I MOST SIGNIFICANTLY INCLUDES PROTECTIONS FOR OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO FOSTER THE RECOVERING FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. BY CONTINUING EXEMPTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESS- SMALL QUANTITY GENERATORS AND EXPANDING THE EXEMPTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO THOSE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. WHO PAY- THE ENVIRONMENTAL FATE. DR WILLIAMS AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL REFORM PACKAGE IN GENERAL FUND BACK BILL BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE ARM ON FUNDING TO ACCELERATE CLEAN UP AND REVITALIZE AND I'M IN BERMAN JUSTICE. THANK YOU. R. THANK YOU HAVE A I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- BUT UNFORTUNATELY- WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THE- THE REPORT. ON WHICH YOU MADE YOUR STATEMENT TODAY ARE BASED YOUR STATEMENT TODAY- UNTIL. AND WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN OUR STAFF DIDN'T RECEIVE THE TRAILER BILL REPORT UNTIL FOUR THIRTY PM YESTERDAY AND THIS IS AFTER MONTHS OF ASKING FOR THE INFORMATION AND AS- THAT YOU REFERENCED- A FAILED ATTEMPT A YEAR AGO AND SO THIS IS REALLY NOT A NEW ISSUE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO THE LAST MINUTE. AND WE'RE HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE. TRYING TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION ON- WHICH YOUR- UP OF VERBAL UP A REPORT YOUR REPORT IS MADE TODAY. SO. I DON'T. LIKE I JUST I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS- WE'RE IN A POSITION WHERE. I CAN SAY HAVING LISTENED TO HER REPORT IT ALL SOUNDS GOOD BUT WE RELY ON OUR OWN STAFF ANALYSIS TO ASK QUESTIONS- AND TO PROBE- THE REPORT THAT YOU MAKE. WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT THE WRITTEN MATERIALS AND FOR US TO BE IN THE SITUATION- I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE HERE. IN A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE MATERIALS WE NEED- AND EVERYBODY KNEW THAT THIS HEARING WAS HAPPENING WHEN IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. SO THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IS A GOOD. WAY TO TELL YOU MY NOTES WHICH WERE WRITTEN- WHICH I WROTE PRIOR TO FOUR THIRTY YESTERDAY- THE ONE QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE FOR YOU IS THIS REPORT GOING TO BE DUMPED ON US AT THE LAST MINUTE- AND- SURE ENOUGH. OF THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. BOB SO CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OVER OUR OVERSIGHT. AND HOW OF THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WITH THE TSC AND THE TRUST THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT- I HAD OF A REQUEST. FOR FEAR REFORM AT WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. IN THE ASSEMBLY SOMETHING WE REFERENCED EARLIER HOW WAS STEEP A CLIMB THAT HAS- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ONE ANOTHER. AND FRANKLY THIS IS NOT A CONFIDENCE BUILDER- WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY. IF I MAY RESPOND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU YEAH THIS IS MY DATE FOR BEING CRANKY I'M SORRY. I THINK I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK YOUR RESPONSES UNREASONABLE- IT'S GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL TO PROVIDE THAT TRAILER BILL. LANGUAGE TO YOU SOONER RATHER THAN- YESTERDAY IN THE DAY YOU KNOW LATE IN THE DAY AND SO. MOVING FORWARD THE BEST WE CAN DO IS BE AVAILABLE TO YOU TO YOUR STAFF TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO PROVIDE THOSE CLARIFICATIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE. AND JUST TO START A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE REFORM IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE'RE NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION NOTHING SEEMS TO BE IDEAL THE STATE. BUT WE WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE THE ENGAGE AND I THINK. DO YOU THE SAN ALL OF OUR- ALL RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY OF THIS REFORM AND REALLY WANT TO SEE IT COME TO FRUITION BUT AS YOU INDICATED VERY EARLY ON IT TO HAVE IT LEFT. AND SO MOVING FORWARD WE HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE HAVING FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE I CALL IN LA- MISTER SMITH. YEAH KIND OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR FOR BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE I CALL IT A PAPER DUMP WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO OF. BE AWARE OF THE SITUATION BUT PRETTY MUCH YOU'RE GOING FROM A FLAT FREE. TWO EIGHT TIERED FEE. BUT TO MY CONCERN IS IT'S GOING TO AFFECT. OFFICE SIDE THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PRETTY MUCH FOR PESTICIDES. BUT IT'S GONNA AFFECT BLEACH DISINFECTANTS. AND ALWAYS DOWN TO THE OF. LAUNDRY DETERGENT. THAT EVERYONE USES. SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OPEN DISCUSSION IN THE TIMING OF THIS. BUT- THE BE DUMPED ON YOU KNOW PROBABLY LESS THAN FOURTEEN HOURS AGO. IN THE PAST TO DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE OF WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE COMMUNITY BUT WE'VE HAD NO WARNING OF THE PROPOSAL AND THERE'S BEEN NO ENGAGEMENT. HOPE FROM AND IS THIS TAX MEANT TO BE A TAX. REVENUE GENERATOR OR IS IT SENDING MARKET SIGNALS FOR MORE OF OUR MANUFACTURERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SALES OF THE PESTICIDES TO DECREASE. IN THE REVENUE IS INSUFFICIENT INTO THE FUTURE. BUT THERE BE LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY OF IF THINGS DON'T CHANGE MY COLLEAGUES WOULD SAY NO TO THIS PROPOSAL THE SYSTEM RELATED TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. OFFICIALS SO- IF YOU FIVE IS STILL COMING UP TO BE HEARD BUT WE WILL. ACCEPT THOSE COULD BE A YOU KNOW THE MOST COMMON ONE IS AVAILABLE TO ISSUE FIVE YOU'RE YOU'RE A- YOUR ONE AND ONLY THIS ISSUE BEHIND US ALL OF. MOVEON AG I UNDERSTAND THAT- SO- PUT THOSE COMMENTS ON HOLD AND APPLY THEM TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM LA- ALTHOUGH- YOU KNOW READING THE- ALEJO REPORT ON THIS OF THE WRITTEN REPORT IT'S BASICALLY. IF WE HAD A REPORT HERE'S ALL THE QUESTIONS WE WOULD WANT TO SEE ANSWERED AND- BUT PLEASE HELLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR- FRANK MINUTES AGAIN WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YES AS YOU MENTIONED- TRAILER BILL WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY SO OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND I'M RELEASING A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL AT A LATER DATE SO WE ANTICIPATE RELEASE OUR PART IN THE COMING WEEKS BUT AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE MEANTIME WE PROVIDED- STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE WITH- QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL REFORM PACKAGE- BASED ON THE THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS THAT WE KNEW AT THE TIME AND THE P. C. P. WAS PROVIDED TO US. THOSE INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT THE BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY- THE FEE RESTRUCTURED INCREASE AND THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT AND THEN THE TAX INCREASE THAT IS INCLUDED AND THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS I'M NOT SEEING ANY LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND YOUR CARD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THE MOMENT BUT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. FOR ISSUE NUMBER FOUR IS THE PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FROM TOXIC CHEMICALS CHEMICALS. YES GOOD MORNING AGAIN A GERMAN BLOOM THIS IS GRECO- DEPUTY OF THE CLEANUP PROGRAM WILL BE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE- SITE DESCRIPTION CLEAN UP AS WELL AS THE BROWNFIELD GRANT PROPOSALS AND THEN- BUT SHIFTING AGREE WILL BE. PROVIDING A SUMMARY FOR THE WORK TRAINING. PROGRAM THE REQUEST. RIGHT IN THE REQUESTED FOR A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE GENERAL FUND THIS INCLUDES THE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SENATE EDUCATION CLEANUP PROGRAM SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR BROWNFIELD GRANT PROGRAM AND THEN FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR A WORK. FORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. ASKED IN TERMS OF STAFF COSTS TO ADMINISTER- THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN BUDGET YEAR THE COMPANY CORPORATIONS AND- NOW HERE'S FUNDING AS A CORPORATE ENTITY IN THE- PROPOSED FEE RATES- IN THE TRAILER BILL. IT IS CONTINGENT UPON ENACTMENT OF. THOSE REFORMS. HE THE RATIONALE FOR HE INVESTIGATION AND CLEANUP PROGRAM IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TOXIC WASTE SITES THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH. OF THE CAMPERS OF THE REASON REDEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTIES AND THEY HARM EFFORTS TO REVITALIZE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY OVERBURDENED BY POLLUTION- STATEWIDE THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND BROWNFIELD SITES IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER SOLUTION TO THIS IS TO DO INVESTIGATION CLEANUP IN AREAS. WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH IS THREATENED AND WHERE REVITALIZATION IS NEEDED. WE WILL USE THE MOST FUNDS TO ACCELERATE THE INVESTIGATION CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES I'M IN INFORMAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES WERE CURRENTLY- FOCUSED ON THE CUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF AREAS UNDER CALAVERAS SCREEN AND AREAS THAT ALSO HAVE VERY HIGH HOUSING NEEDS USING. BUT APARTMENT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT'S. HOUSING NEEDS SURVEY. A WORLD TO COORDINATING WITH H. C. H. C. D. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOOLS THAT WE WILL USE HOW WOULD IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. I'LL JUST QUICKLY SHIFTED TO THE BROWNFIELDS PROGRAM SUMMARIZE THAT- THE GRANTS WILL ESSENTIALLY BE USED TO GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS AND OTHER ENTITIES TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP SITES TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS REVITALIZED ON. COMMUNITIES GRANTS LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES THE U. S. U. K. ESTIMATES THAT ROUGHLY EVERY DOLLAR- FROM THE BROWNFIELDS PROGRAM RESULTED IN A TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS- IN THE EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE AND CLEAN UP AND ROUGHLY TEN DROPS OF EVERY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS INVESTED- AR PROVIDED. BY THESE EFFORTS. WE ARE ONCE AGAIN COORDINATING WITH- H. T. T. AND INTERNALLY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DO IT REALLY AS A KIND OF PIPELINE. THAT WILL. INVESTIGATE SITES REMEDIATE CONTAMINATION TO CUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROVIDE RE USE- OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN HMD'S EFFORT ALSO A BUDGET REQUEST. IN FISCAL YEAR I WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE PROFIT GRANT PROGRAM IS- INVESTING MONEY NOW. IN BROWNFIELDS CHANGE EVER STRUCTURE EXPENSES AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL VIRAL DEGRADATION THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREAMFIELDS- BECAUSE THESE SITES ARE OFTEN LOCATED NEAR SERVICES AND AMENITIES SUCH AS JOB TRAINING CENTERS. SHOPPING AREAS SCHOOLS HEALTHCARE CENTRES- AND OTHER NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE REALLY DO VIEW IT AS A- WIN WIN FOR COMMUNITIES. I'M. SURE I'M NOT HAND IT OVER TO- THANK YOU. FOR POSTING TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS OF BROWNFIELD BRANSON ORPHANS THAT CLAIMS BY ESTABLISHING A TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. BY INVESTING AND THIS ONE TIME FUNDING TO BUILD LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY AND WORKFORCE EXPERTS DETAILS HE WOULD DIRECTLY SUPPORT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EQUITABLE JOB EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES IN LOCAL AREAS WERE BROWNFIELD GRANTS ARE AWARDED. THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES AND LESSONS LEARNED OF SUPPORTING LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ON THE EXIDE CLEANUP FOR MORE THAN NINETY PEOPLE COMPLETED A VARIETY OF TRAININGS OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. MORE THAN SEVENTY OF THOSE GRADUATES HAVE WORKED SIGNIFICAN HOURS ON THE PROJECT WHICH MEANS THEY'VE EARNED CERTIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE TO HELP MEET THEIR FUTURE. CAREER GOALS. IN THIS INSTANCE WE WOULD ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LEVERAGING THIS CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN PEOPLE AND PROMOTE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU- COMMUNITIES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS TO BUILD THE PROGRAM WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY THAT MEETS ITS EACH REGION'S UNIQUE WORKFORCE AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. DEBBIE DR GRANT KOPEN I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. SO- MY NOTES INDICATE THAT- PTSD IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON SEVENTEEN OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SITES- IS THAT ACCURATE. YES SIR THAT'S ACCURATE. WE HAVE THE JURISDICTION WE'VE GOT WORK AT TOM BRADLEY SET SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SITES ACROSS THE STATE- WILL WILL SOME OF THE THEE HUNDRED MILLION GO TO ADDRESS THAT BACKLOG. ABSOLUTELY CHARMING BLOOM- WE ANTICIPATE THAT ROUGHLY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE YOU- FINISH THE CLEANUP AT TWENTY TWO OR SITES. THAT DTS HE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON. THE SITES ARE LOCATED IN. THE TOP 25% OF TOWN BY RISKY SCREEN COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS AREAS WITH VERY HIGH HOUSING NEEDS UNDER H. C. D.'S- HOUSING THE CIRCUIT. GREAT AND- HOW MUCH OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DO YOU THINK THE TNC CAN SPEND IN. ONE FISCAL YEAR. IT'S A VERY GOOD- QUESTION. THE THE AMOUNT REALLY DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS- THE NUMBER OF GRANT APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVE- THE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN HIRE- AND TRAIN QUALIFIED STAFF TO DO THE WORK. REALLY A LOT DEPENDS TOO ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SITES THAT WE INVESTIGATE- AND POTENTIALLY CLEAN UP. SO THE IMPORTANT THING WE'RE DOING NOW WE ACTUALLY STARTED THIS- YOU KNOW SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IS WORKING TO PUT TOGETHER- THE PLANS SEVEN PLANS PROTOCOLS GUIDELINES THAT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FOUNDATION BUT ESSENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR RAPIDLY HIRING PEOPLE. FOR GETTING GRANT- POSTAL'S READ AGREE. AGGRESSIVE MADE WE'RE TRYING FRONT LOAD THE PROCESS. SO THAT SHOULD THE REQUEST BE- PROVIDED FOR THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR WE'RE READY TO GO ON DAY ONE. WELL I CAN APPRECIATE THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME- YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD A REFORM PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD KIND OF CROSSOVER- THE PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN WHICH THIS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. IF IT IF THE REFORM MOVES FORWARD SO WHAT WHY NOT- FUND. THE AT NEXT YEAR'S NEEDS. AND WAIT FOR THE REFORM TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN MOVE FORWARD LONG TERM AFTER THAT. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER EXCELLENT QUESTION- SO THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT IN OUR WORK BUT WE BASICALLY- WE ARE SITES ALL ACROSS THE STATE A ROUGHLY HELLO YOU KNOW ONE OF THREE PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN A MILE OF THE SITE THAT WE WORK. AND ABOUT 50% OF THOSE ARE INTERNAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES- FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S REFLECTED IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. COMMUNITIES NEED HELP NOW- TOXIC WASTE SITES THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEY HAMPER- REVITALIZATION EFFORTS WITHIN COMMUNITIES- AS A REFERENCE EARLY THERE'S TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BROWNFIELD SITES ACROSS THE STATE- ONCE AGAIN FROM OUR EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SENDS THOSE GOING TO BE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE COMMITTEES WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY OVERBURDENED BY POLLUTION- SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS- I DON'T FIGHT THESE FUNDS TO HELP INITIATE THESE ACTIONS- TO ASSIST THESE COMMUNITIES. WELL I WON HER PERCENT AGREE WITH YOU ON THE URGENCY OF- MOVING FORWARD ON THESE PROJECTS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I THINK WE DID A REPORT FROM L. A. L. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU- CHAIRMAN FRAGMENTOS AGAIN WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE CANNOT HAVE A- FULL REPORT OR ASSESSMENT ON- THE BROWNFIELD CLEANUPS PROPOSAL I'M THE MINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT. THIS PROPOSAL IS CONTINGENT ON IT MEANT OUR LEGISLATURES ACCEPTANCE OF THE PHYSICAL AND GOVERNMENT REFORM PACKAGE WE FELT IT WAS PREMATURE TO. PROVIDE A FULL ASSESSMENT UNTIL TRAILER BILL WITHOUT STEP. IN DISSIPATE RELEASING A FULL REPORT ON THIS ISSUE ALONG WITH THE REFORM PACKAGE IN THE COMING WEEKS. WELL IT PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF WITH- QUESTIONS THAT WE FEEL THAT THE- LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER GOING FORWARD AND ASSESSING THIS PROPOSAL SUCH AS IDENTIFYING- THE HIGHEST. TARGETED GOAL THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED THAT BOTH FOR MEDIATION AND HOUSING ARE ARE BOTH GOALS WHICH WE FIND ARE WORTHWHILE ENDEAVORS BUT- TARGETING A SPECIFIC GOAL- WILL ENSURE THAT. THE FUNDS ARE WELL TARGETED AND- PROVIDES WHAT. WITH ADEQUATE OVER. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND YOUR MARCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU ARE EITHER FOR YOUR- MISTER COPE- ACTUALLY PROBABLY MR CONSTANCY MADE THE TATEMENT ADDED I HEAR ACCURATELY THAT ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS LIVE WITHIN ONE MILE OF THE TOXIC SITE. THAT WE'RE WE HAVE DONE WORK THAT IS CORRECT YEAH. THAT'S ONLY WHERE YOU'VE DONE WORK SO THERE MAY BE OTHER SITES WE HAVEN'T DONE WORK. THAT WOULD. EXPAND THE PROBLEM EVEN FURTHER. YES SIR WHILE THAT'S A STARTLING AND SHOCKING DATA POINT THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO A ISSUE FIVE. THAT TRANSITION TO. SAFER SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WE'VE GOT TO. ARMENPRESS THE SAID REGULATION AND- FROM THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE QUEUED UP FOR THIS ONE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOW AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANKS FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS BATTLE SCENE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO START A CONVERSATION WITH A BRIEF STATEMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED BUDGET BUT BEFORE I DO THAT MISTER SMITH RAISED ISSUE NUMBER THREE ON THE NON PRESENTATION CALENDAR THAT WAS FOR THE KALPETTA STE. BCP PRO REGISTRATION SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PUBLIC WORKSHOP SIR IN LATE MARCH ON THAT AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO. CIRCLE BACK WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF WITH ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON. OUR PRESENTATION TODAY WILL FOCUS ON OUR P. C. P. TO REQUEST SUPPORT FOR THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. SECRETARY BLUMENFELD REFERENCE THIS IN HIS OPENING REMARKS. AND I WOULD FURTHER AT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO REPLACE THE CURRENT FLAT FEE MILLICENT SMITH ON PESTICIDE SALES. WITH A RISK BASED TIERED MELISSA SPENT. WHERE HIGHER TOXICITY PESTICIDES ARSONIST A HIGHER FEE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SENDS A STRONG MARKET SIGNAL. OF CHIU AFFECTED. THE BILL PAYERS AND WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD. ONCE THIS NEW APPROACH IS FULLY PHASED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND AGAIN WE GAVE A FOUR YEAR PHASE IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR BILL PAYERS TO ADJUST TO THIS NEW SYSTEM. THE TIERED MIL APPROACH. INCENTIVES TO PAY TO GENERATE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE ANNUALLY TO THE DB ARE FUN. THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES RAISED BY THE TIERED MILL WILL FUND IMPORTANT DPR AND CDFA PROGRAMS. YOU SEE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION CSU'S AG RESEARCH INSTITUTE. WILL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS FOR THE WORK THAT THOSE ESSENTIAL PARTNERS OF THE DEPARTMENT DO ON LOCAL PESTICIDE USE AND FORSMAN ACTIVITIES. IT WILL ALSO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE MORE DEEPLY AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH PESTICIDE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND OTHER CALIFORNIANS AROUND THE STATE. YOU KNOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS ADMINISTRATION WE'VE DONE A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK TO ACCELERATE THE STATE'S TRANSITION FROM. HARMFUL PESTICIDES TO A SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO MANAGE PESTS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT DPR AND CDFA AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THESE HIGH PM ACTIVITIES. OF FROM CHILD CARE CENTERS TO SCHOOLS TO WORK THAT WE DO WITH LOCAL GROWERS AROUND CALIFORNIA. BUT THE REALLY GREAT NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND BACKYARD GARDENERS AND OPEN SPACE MANAGERS AND MANY OTHERS. HAVE BEEN UTILIZING IPM PRACTICES. SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. REPORTER PARTICULAR I ABOUT THE SAID PERSON. AND ALMOND GROWERS AND STRAWBERRY GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA. ALL WHO HAVE DEVELOPED IMPORTANT NEW IPM TOOLS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP IDENTIFY NEW ALTERNATIVES SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR US- THANK YOU OF IT MISTER SMITH DID YOU WANT TO RESTATE SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS SO YOU GET AN ANSWER TODAY OR I JUMPED EARLIER. OVER EARLIER THANK YOU UP IN REGARDS TO THE FLINT MILLER SETTLEMENT GOING TO TIERED. MY QESTION IS WHY HAVEN'T YOU ENGAGE THE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FARMING COMMUNITY. WILL BE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. WITHOUT NO WARNING SO FAR. MISTER SMITH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED A REALLY PRETTY DEEPLY WITH OUR AGRICULTURAL STAKEHOLDERS SINCE WE ANNOUNCED THE BUDGET ON JANUARY TENTH AND THEN WON. SUPPLEMENTAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY I WILL CONTINUE THAT ENGAGEMENT IN FACT I'M GOING DOWN TO FRESNO LATER THIS WEEK TO MEET WITH THE GROUP DOWN THERE AND I'M SURE THAT THIS TOPIC WILL. COME UP WE'VE ALSO HAD SOME REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS FOLKS. AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS IN SACRAMENTO AND ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AND MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND- AND WANT TO LEARN MORE BUT I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO. ENGAGE FURTHER WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON QUESTIONS LIKE THIS. AND WHAT WOULD BE- THE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WITH THE CELLS OF THE PESTICIDES DECREASE. AND THE REVENUE OF COMES UP IN SUFFICIENT IN THE FUTURE. YEAH ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION SIR YOU KNOW WE'VE MADE SOME PRETTY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS WITH OUR PROJECTIONS. RELATIVE TO YOUR DIRECT QUESTION AND YOU KNOW THE- TRAILS AROUND PESTICIDE SALES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY STABLE IN THE SIGNAL WORK CATEGORIES THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED IN THIS PROPOSAL OVER THE LAST FIVE OR MORE YEARS. AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT RELATIVE TO THE TEARING IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LESS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS AND A ONE POINT 9% WILL BE THE INCREASE THERE SO I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE MADE SOME PRETTY GOOD ASSUMPTIONS GOING FORWARD INTO THE OUT YEARS. THANK YOU. MISTER MULLIN AND THEN MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST AT THE OUTSET I'D SAY I'M GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TEARS- AND INCENTIVIZING. THE USE OF PESTICIDES THAT THAT DO THE LEAST HARM I CERTAINLY THINK THAT'S A NOBLE GOAL THAT THE QUESTION IS WHAT. MIGHT SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME ANSWERS- OPPONENTS ARE ARE BEING VOCAL ON THIS ONE MAKE SURE THAT APARTMENT IS ENGAGING WITH THOSE FOLKS. CAN YOU ARTICULATE FOR ME WHAT WHAT SOME OF THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE THAT THE OPPONENTS ARE. SUGGESTING HERE- I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S IN A NOBLE EFFORT- THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT IN THE REAL WORLD DO WE ACTUALLY GET THE- THE NET RESULT AND THE APPROPRIATE USAGE OF THE RIGHT KINDS OF THESE- OF THESE PESTICIDES- WHAT WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION- RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS. WELL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISTER MOLD YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED ON MY TEAM AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT CDFA A PATH. THE LAST NUMBER OF WEEKS WITH FOLKS WHO. HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ARE YOU KNOW. ABOUT THE DETAILS AND WHAT THE SIGNAL WORDS REALLY NEED THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUNDS WILL BE RAISED IN THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE. INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNAL WORDS THE SIGNAL WORD APPROACH. WE DEVELOPED WAS USED BECAUSE WE FELT THAT MOST RATE BUT MOST REGISTRANTS AND MIL PLAYERS HAD SOME FAMILIARITY WITH U. S. EPA'S METHOD OF DEVELOPING SIGNAL WORK SO WE HAVE NONE AND CAUTION ON THE LESS TOXIC END OF THE SPECTRUM WARNING IN THE MIDDLE AND DANGEROUS FLASHPOINTS AND ON THE FAR END. AND WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD SOLID EASILY UNDERSTOOD WAY OF DEVELOPING THIS NEW TIERED MECHANISM ABOUT 63% OF THE SALES IN CALIFORNIA FALL UNDER THAT NON SLASH CAUTION AND AGAIN THAT'S WHERE THE SMALLEST IMPACT WILL BE IN TERMS OF- IMPACTS ON REGISTRANTS. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT FOR NON SLASH CAUTION WE'RE DEFERRING THE MILL INCREASE FOUR YEAR BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY COVERT NINETEEN RELATED PRODUCTS THAT FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY IN THE DEPARTMENT HAS REALLY BEEN GOOD ABOUT EXPEDITING THE REGISTRATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND GETTING THEM TO MARKET FOR INSTITUTIONAL GIVES. ABOUT MIDDLE CATEGORIES ABOUT 14% BY SALES AND THE DANGER SLASH POISON IS 23% SO YOU KNOW MY CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD- BEGINNING THE DAY THAT THE BUDGET WAS ANNOUNCED AND MANY SUBSEQUENT MEETING SINE THEN WILL BE TO HEAR OUT THE CONCERNS OF THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE IDEA. TRYING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHERE I CAN SEE IF THEIR SUGGESTIONS FOR YOU KNOW THINGS THAT MIGHT TWEAK OUT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT A MORE EFFECTIVE ONE. AND TO INCORPORATE. THAT INTO OUR THINKING GOING FORWARD. BRIGITTE ANSWERED THANK YOU. WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. OVER I CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENTS- CONCEPT HERE AND THE GOVERNOR'S- SUPPORT FOR THIS THE IDEA OF MOVING TO TIERED STRUCTURES MAKES SIMPLE COMMONSENSE WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO. ADD IS SEE IF WE COULD FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ON THE ISSUE OF SUSTAINABILITY OF THE FEES I THINK NO MATTER WHERE WE ALL ARE- POLITICALLY ALMOST EVERYBODY WOULD SAY IT MAKES COMMON SENSE NOT TO RUN DEFICITS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THINK SAID GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN DEFICITS OVERALL AND IF YOU SHOULD RUN DEFICITS OVERALL YOU SHOULD RUN DEFICITS IN DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE WHEN THE DEPARTMENT RUNS A DEFICIT. AND THEN HAS TO TRY TO BORROW FROM SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT OF MOTHER FUND X. CENTER IN THE SECOND CONCEPT THAT I THINK ALMOST EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IS THAT IF YOU ACCURATELY PRICED SOMETHING FOR ITS OVERALL COST YOU USE THAT PRODUCT MORE EFFICIENTLY SO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO JUST DUMP A BUNCH OF EXTERNAL COST OFFER THE SORT OF THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO MANY TIMES. PEOPLE USE MORE OF SOMETHING BUT IF THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PAY THE TRUE COST SO- IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH SOME PEOPLE BENEFIT FINANCIALLY FROM THE USE OF THE PESTICIDES THEY GET TO GROW MORE CROPS MAKE MORE PROFITS NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT'S A BAD THING AT ALL AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING IT'S BAD FOR CONSUMERS CONSUMERS BENEFIT ALSO BECAUSE THEY GET MORE FOOD AT EXETER. BUT IF WE ACCURATELY PRICE. THE TWO COST OF THE PRODUCTION OF THAT PRODUCT WE GET A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF THAT. AND SO- I'M NOT- THE- OVERALL REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH A FOUR YEAR PHASE IN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE DEFICIT TO RUN UNTIL THAT FOURTH YEAR. BUT I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THE FOUR YEAR PHASE IN BECAUSE I REALIZE POLITICALLY IT IT HELPS PEOPLE MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. BUT WHAT I AM CONCERNED WITH IS WHEN WE FINISH THAT FOURTH YEAR- WE WILL GO BACK TO WHAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH THIS DEPARTMENT. THE LAST TIME THIS BILL FEE WAS INCREASED WAS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COST OF RUNNING THE PROGRAMS THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT. AND MONITORING EXETER GRADUALLY WENT UP AND UP AND UP AND THE DEPARTMENT RAN A BIGGER BIGGER DEFICIT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT GOOD GOVERNMENT PRINCIPLES AND COMMON SENSE WHILE WE MAY SAY POLITICALLY WE PHASE IT IN. WE SHOULDN'T STOP THAT AT THE FOUR YEAR MARK. I THINK WE SHOULD. BUILD IN SOME KIND OF. ALL OF LIVING A JUST. AND I THINK WE CAN BE CREATIVE ABOUT THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX EVERY YEAR WHICH WOULD CAUSE SOME WEIRD YOU KNOW PERCENTAGES BUT- MAYBE YOU DO IT EVERY TWO YEARS MAYBE YOU. BUT THAT THAT SHOULD BE A PRINCIPLE THAT I THINK MOST OF US COULD AGREE UPON BECAUSE- IT IS IT JUST MAKES COMMON SENSE IT WOULD KEEP THE DEPARTMENT FOR RUNNING A DEFICIT MORE CLOSELY MATCH REVENUES. TO EXPENDITURES AND IT WOULD ALSO GIVE US A CHANCE TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH THE IMPACTS- AND THEREFORE THE THAT THE COST OF APPLICATION. SO I'VE HEARD THE ISSUE RAISED. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE REVENUES ARE NOT ENOUGH- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE INCREASED. COST WILL CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF THE PESTICIDE. AND I WOULD OFFER TO YOU. THAT'S A GREAT THING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IF YOU DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF PESTICIDE USE YOU HOPEFULLY HAVE FEWER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE LESS ENFORCEMENT. BEING NEEDED XCERRA SO I WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO- STRONGLY CONSIDER SOME KIND OF COST OF LIVING INDEX IF WE'RE GOING TO. GO THROUGH THE CHALLENGE OF A TIERED RATE INCREASE FOR- AND WE'RE GOING TO PHASE IT IN THEN IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO TALK ABOUT PHASING IN- OR THE FOR THE PHASE IN CONTINUING WITH SOME KIND OF COST OF LIVING INCREASE. THAT WOULD BE OVERALL GOOD GOVERNMENT FOR CALIFORNIA. IF WE COULD DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT TO. THE IMBALANCES ADDRESSED IN YEAR ONE ACCORDING TO OUR PROJECTIONS YEARS HOPEFULLY THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT. PIECE OF THE ISSUE AND THEN- YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT PESTICIDE USE TRANS AND- AND WHAT CATEGORIES ARE UP AND WATER DOWN THE BACK AND SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER CONVERSATION BUT- PAGE NOT ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LET'S HEAR FROM ALEJO AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I'M FRANK JIMENEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OVERALL WE FIND THAT ADJUSTING THE MELISSA'S BEEN IS WARRANTED GIVEN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND THE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL FUNDS ALSO KNOWN AS THE TURN BUTTON. YOU FIND AT ESTABLISHING A TIERED MILL ASSESSMENT OF PLACES A HIGHER CHARGE THEM- MORE TOXIC PESTICIDES IS REASONABLE AND COULD ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE USE. AND OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE GOVERNOR SPENDING UNDER THIS PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE GIVEN THAT AT LARGE DATASETS THE STATE DIDN'T REDUCING PESTICIDE USAGE AND EXPANDS THE STATE'S EFFORTS AND UPHOLDING PESTICIDE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PHASE AND ANY CHAIRED MEL ASSESSMENT AND ONE OR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THE FOUR YEARS THAT'S BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE FIND THAT A FOR YOUR FACE AN AS IS UNUSUALLY LONG. AND ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THIS THE FAITH AND WOULD REDUCE SHORT TERM COST THE BUYERS AND SELLERS OF PESTICIDES- IT WOULD HAVE SOME NOTABLE DRAWBACKS IT POTENTIALLY CREATES A WEAKER MARKET SIGNAL FROM THE START SINCE THE- EIGHTH IT'LL BE. SLOWER AND THEN USING A SLOWER AND GENERATES. REVENUES UP FRONT WHICH REQUIRES GENERAL FUND TO COVER PROPOSED SPENDING AS SEEN IN A PROPOSAL. AN ANALYSIS WE PROVIDE- THE LEGISLATURE WITH ALTERNATIVE PAID THINGS THAT USE THE SAME RATES OF THE GOVERNOR BUT OUR IMPLEMENTED AND- A ONE YEAR PHASE IN A TWO YEAR PHASE AND WE THINK THAT- THAT ALIGNS. REVENUES WITH SPENDING AND ALSO PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE MORE FLEXIBILITY. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE LINE AND A NEW SPENDING WITH THE RATE AT WHICH REVENUES ARE GENERATED. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HAVE NO REVENUES- TO FULLY FUND PROPOSED SPENDING. A MINUTE GENERAL FUND COSTS AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE DPR FIND- WE ALSO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH TO- GREATER POLICY QUESTIONS FIRST IS- THE NOTION OF SIGNAL WORD- GET MINISTRATION IS. PROPOSING TO BASE ITS YOUR TAX ON SIGNAL WORD. WHICH INDICATES A PRODUCTS- ACUTE TOXICITY LEVEL. AND SPEAKING WITH EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ACUTE TOXICITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH. CHRONIC TOXICITY OR A LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES THAT ADDRESS A BROADER BROADER RANGE OF PESTICIDE RELATED CONCERNS. AND WHETHER- RATE SHOULD REFLECT REVENUE TARGETS ARE MARK NICK PARK MARKET SIGNAL- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED RATES WOULD FULLY FUND THE PROPOSED SPENDING ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. ON A DRESS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- HOWEVER UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST TIER WILL BE ROUGHLY FIND THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PRICE DIFFERENCE SO IT WOULDN'T HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON THE- THE MIX OF PESTICIDES USED IN THE STATE. SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER- A DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE THAN BEING PROPOSED. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES- SECURE STEAM IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND ANSWER ANY OF YOUR- DIRECT TAX RELATED QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS THIS IS JUST ABOUT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMPLEMENT THE L. A. ILL IN IN TERMS OF THEIR ANALYSIS AYE- AS I READ THIS AND IN PREPARATION I THOUGHT. VERY GOOD INSIGHTS- TALKING ABOUT A 2% DIFFERENCE AND IS THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO ROUTE TO REALLY REFLECT THAT THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS IN TERMS OF TOXICITY- THE SAME THING WITH. USING THE SIGNAL WORDS- IS THERE A BETTER IT'S LIVE VERY LEGITIMATE TO RAISE I BELIEVE ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THE L. A. O. WAS RAISED- MY QUESTION SIMPLY IS IMPLEMENTATION IF WE TRIED TO ADOPT ALL OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ALEJO- IT. IT MAY MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACTUALLY PULL THIS OFF AND SO- IF YOU'D TALK ABOUT ENGAGING THE HEAVY LIFT- SOMETIMES YOU GET TO SING TO PROVE. BUT I WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOU FOR RAISING THOSE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY INSIGHTFUL- OBSERVATIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

BY CONTINUING THE FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM TO SCHOOL INCUBATOR GRANT PROGRAM CDFA IS OFFICE OF FARM WORK WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEEN GAUGED IN PARKS WHAT PROGRAMMING LEADING TO INCREASED ADOPTION OF HARMFUL PRACTICES. A GREATER IMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S HIGHEST NEED COMMUNITIES AND ONGOING SUCCESS FOR SCHOOLS FARMERS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT- TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

THANK YOU WE HAVE A REPORT FROM A LA- OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME MINISTER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THIS IS- ITEM RAISE NO CONCERNS FOR US. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FIND THAT THAT'S THE THING YES THE GENERAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WERE HAPPY TO HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE AT THE MOMENT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN NOW. IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALIGNMENT OF REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGRICULTURE I THINK IT'S THE MOST WALKIE TITLE. MANY OF OUR REPORTS TODAY. YEAH YEAH THANK YOU- YES- PRIOR TO KOBE NINETEEN FARMERS AND RANCHERS WERE FACING INCREASING YOU CHALLENGES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE WATER AND CERTAINTY A NUMBER OF NEW REGULATION SENATE PASSED IN THE PAST DECADE BETTER NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. AND MANY OF THESE COME WITH SEPARATE RECORDING REQUIREMENTS A FEW YEARS AGO AT CDFA WE HAD A GRADUATE STUDENT FROM THE GOLDMAN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS WHO MAPPED OUT THE NUMBER OF REGULATIONS THAT FARMERS OF ALL SIZES MUST COMPLY WITH. AND BE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES. I KNOW THAT WHEN I GO OUT AND SECRETARY ROCKETS OUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR GOES OUT NEED TO FOR HOURS. WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THIS REGULATORY BURDENS. IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY AND THE COST OF COMPLIANCE. AND THE MANY REPORTS THAT ARE DUE AT DIFFERENT TIMES OPTING OUT IN ASKING FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR INFORMATION. TO BE SENT TO MULTIPLE AGENCIES. HAVE KIND OF THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX TITLE- IN THIS PROJECT- AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC WHEN RESTAURANTS CAFETERIAS EVENTS AND HOSPITALITY CLOSE. NEARLY HALF THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN HALTED COMPLETELY. AS WE LOOK AT RECOVERING FROM THE HUGE DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE KNOW THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT. OF OUR SMALL FARMERS WERE IMPACTED. SO AS PART OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE AT CDFA HER COLLEAGUES THAT COUNTY PA. ARE REQUESTING FOUR MILLION CURRENT YEAR TO HIRE A CONSULTANT CAN MANAGE A PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND MAP OUT THOSE REGULATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND IDENTIFY I. Q. KEY AREAS WHERE WE CAN JOINTLY EMBARK. TO ALIGN AND STREAMLINE THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IN ADDITION TO THE JOINT COUNTY PETE CDFA HOW ETA PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT CDFA IS ALSO REQUESTING TWO MILLION AND BUDGET YEAR TARNISHING AND I. T. BUSINESS ASSESSMENT TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIFIED LIFE THING FOR PORTAL. FOR FIFTY TWO LICENSE TYPES ACROSS THIRTY EIGHT PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENT. NEEDS TO PROD ARE ABOUT IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM LIFE A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AND UNDERSERVED FARMERS AND RANCHERS. BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF COSTS BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A DEDICATED ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. TO DO ALL OF THAT REGULATORY REPORTING- AND MORE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DIVERSIFIED OPERATION. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A STARK STRAWBERRY SPECTOR COMMISSIONED THE STUDY ESTIMATED AT LEAST 7% OF THEIR OPERATING COSTS WERE JUST AROUND THE COMPLAINTS RECORDING COSTS. ARE SEPARATE PRODUCERS. REDUCING THESE COSTS BY STREAMLINING STATE REPORTING PROCESSES ACROSS AGENCIES. OUT COMPACT COMPROMISING ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO HELP FARMERS AND RANCHERS ESPECIALLY SMALL AND UNDERSERVED FARMERS CURRENTLY STRUGGLING TO RECOVER FROM THE FINANCIAL IMPACT. OF THE NINETEENTH AND HELP THE STATE MARK EQUITABLY SERVE SMALL ARMS. THANK YOU AND HAVE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT- AND- KUDOS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR. RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE AND TO- TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS IT I THINK IT'S A- IT IT IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT- HOW YOU APPROACH THE VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT. HAS ARE THERE ANY- OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- OF THE LA OVER A DEPARTMENT FINANCE COMMENTS. THANKS RESEARCH I AM PREGNANT AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS PART OF A LAST MINUTE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSAL TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I'M NOT A PLACE ON AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND ALWAYS FIND THAT ASSESSMENT OF THIS NATURE HAS MERIT- AT THE TIME THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROVIDE US WITH A COMPELLING LIST OF DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IT INTENDS TO ASSESS. HAVING THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE- CONFIDENCE THAT THE PROBLEM DOES EXIST AND THAT FUNDING WILL BE WELL TARGETED. BUT I'M MORE HAPPY TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMITTEE- REVIEWING. THAT INFORMATION DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED TODAY- ON THE ONLINE. PORTAL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED DEPARTMENT TO REPORT AT BUDGET HEARINGS ON. I'M OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED- WE FIND THAT ASSESSING THE ONLINE PAYMENT PORTAL- IS A REASONABLE SENSE IT DOES. IT IS SEEN AS OVER BURDENSOME TO AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. HOWEVER THE ASSESSMENT LARGELY BENEFITS AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY M. AND AS A PROVIDE A WIDE ENOUGH PUBLIC BENEFIT TO. CLEARLY NECESSITATE GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FRAZIER MEMBERS THIS IS ANDREW HOLTZ APARTMENT FINANCE I'M THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS MORE APPROPRIATE FUNDS SOURCE IN THIS CASE- IT ALIGNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WHICH IS CONTINUING TO FACE MANY CHALLENGES AND THIS IS PART OF AN OVERALL PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES THREE ETERNITY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES FOR CDFA. TO DETERMINE HOW TO EQUITABLY SPREAD- THESE FEES ACROSS THE INDUSTRY UNDER THE VARIOUS TYPES OF. REPAIRS INTO THE FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR SHARE THOSE COMMENTS. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT FAIRGROUNDS. THANK YOU CHAIR I'M GOING TO INTERVIEWS- MY COLLEAGUE DEPUTY SECRETARY KEVIN MASAHARU IS GOING TO INTRODUCE THE TOPIC. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FOR THE RECORD KEVIN MASU HARD AT THE SECRETARIAT CDFA PRINT MINISTRATION AND FINANCE. I'M ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT THE FAIRGROUNDS OPERATIONAL SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ITEM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS IN TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR THE NETWORK AFFAIRS. AT THE TWENTY TWENTY GLOBAL PANDEMIC RESULTED IN A COMPLETE SHUT DOWN. BEING THE MAIN DRIVER THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO DERIVE REVENUES. INSIDE HAD A VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AND ALL THE REVENUES THAT THEY- WERE ANTICIPATING TO ACCRUE TO THEM IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN ALSO AS WE MOVE INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE SEASON WERE FACING THE SAME CONDITIONS- BUT IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT- THE REVENUE DROPPING OFF LIKE THAT WERE NOT MET WITH. EQUAL REDUCTIONS TO THE EXPENDITURES THAT THEY FACED A WE DID ADDRESS THAT LAST YEAR WITH A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION TO HELP STATE AFFILIATED FAIRS NAVIGATE AWAY OFF PROCESS TO STOP PRODUCTION. IT DOES IN OTHER EXPENSE STATEMENTS THAT STRATEGY LIKE THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO FACE THOSE CHALLENGES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER DUE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS ROLE IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT MAY SERVE AS- A MYRIAD OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. EVERYTHING FROM THE BACK YOU AGENTS CENTERS TO A CODE NINETEEN VACCINATION SITES AND- WARMING CENTERS AND MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT IT'S PARAMOUNT THAT WE PROVIDE ENOUGH OPERATIONAL SUPPORT TO KEEP THEM UP AND RUNNING AND TO MAKE THEM VIABLE AS ASSETS. IN WERE ALSO IT WITHIN THE FIFTY MILLION FOR THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT'S GOING TO BE USED TO ASSESS THE FAIR GROUNDS FOR POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE USES. AND NOT JUST ALSO UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO STATUS QUO THESE DAYS AND THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO DO TO TRY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE SITUATIONS THAT I ENCOUNTERED. I'M AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE DURING CATASTROPHIC EVENTS AND SERVE MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. YES SO THAT TEN MILLIONDOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALSO IS PART OF THAT. THESE ARE ALL VERY AGING STATE ASSETS AND- RECENT SURVEYS THAT SHOWN THAT THERE'S PROBABLY. ALMOST TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT COULD BE DONE IF THOSE UNDS WERE AVAILABLE SO AT TEN MILLION IS JUST SMALL START TOWARDS THAT IN THAT DIRECTION TO DO THAT. AND WITHOUT. ALL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT I MISS MAFI HARA- WHEN- WHEN I HAVE A FAIR GROUND IS USED- BY THE STATE- IF FOR EXAMPLE WHEN- CAL FIVE SETS UP A INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER IS THERE A REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS- TO THE TO THE FAIR OR IS THAT. JUST MADE AVAILABLE AND TO OTHERS NO TRANSFER OF FUNDS. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND ACTUALLY IS A MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION THAN YOU PROBABLY THINK ON THE SURFACE. THERE SOME THINGS DEPENDING ON THE USE THERE IS NOT A COST RECOVERY OPPORTUNITY- BUT WHEN THE MONEY COMES IN AND OUT PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM AREIMBURSEMENT. AND THEN ALSO IN CERTAIN INSTANCES OTHER MONEY COMES IN FROM NONPROFITS LIKE THE RED CROSS TO PROVIDE SHELTER AND SERVICES MY PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED. AND SO THE ANSWER IS THAT YES THERE IS SOME COST RECOVERY- BUT IT'S NOT AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS AND THERE ARE WE DO END UP WITH COSTS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE RECOVERED DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS I SEE OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS. THE L. A. O. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STATE AFFILIATED FARES UNTIL THE MAY REVISION. I ALWAYS FIND THAT PROVIDING OPERATIONAL SUPPORTERS REASONABLE SINCE FARES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONDUCT THEIR NORMAL REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES. OVER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT PAIRS WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR- WE FOUND THAT THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THIS GIVEN THAT SOCIAL. DISTANCING GUIDELINES MIGHT BE UPDATED AS MORE PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED. WE BELIEVE THAT DELAYING A DECISION ON THIS ITEM BUT ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO USE THE ADDITIONAL TIME TO INFORM ITS DECISION ON THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO PROVIDE- OF THE FORTY SEVEN MILLION THAT IS BEING PROVIDED FOR- OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. THE DEPARTMENT IS INDICATED THAT HALF WILL BE. TARGETED BASED ON FINANCIAL NEED OF THE FARES AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. I RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FUNDS. HAVING A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. AND TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS TARGETED BECAUSE THESE FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO BE. ADJUSTED METHODOLOGIES ARE LIKELY TO BE ADJUSTED AS WELL AS MORE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE ON THE FARES- AND THE NOTIFICATION SHOULD INCLUDE THE AMOUNT PROVIDED TO EACH STATE AFFILIATED FAIR. THE METHOD OF THE ADMINISTRATION USED TO ALLOCATE FUNDING. ANY REMAINING BALANCE AND THE DEPARTMENTS EXPECTED USE OF THAT BALANCE. ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. FUNDING FOR THIS REQUEST- THERE'S PROVIDE- HARDENS THE RESPONSE FOR THE STATE AND- DEMONSTRATION HAS INDICATED THAT. THERE AND SHOWN THAT THERE'S- THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEED AMONGST THE NETWORK AFFAIRS. THANK YOU FORMER FINANCE. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBER THIRTY LAGGED OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST A COUPLE POINTS- YOU KNOW I THINK WE GET THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE. THE ON ON YOU KNOW WHAT DIRECTIVITY THE FARES MAY BE ABLE TO- CONDUCT NEXT YEAR JUST GIVEN THE- OVERALL UNCERTAINTY THE ON THE COMMUNITY EVENT THAT MAKE- I THINK YOU KNOW THE ESTIMATE BASED OFF OF THE- AVAILABLE INFORMATION DATA AND WE HAVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME- IN TERMS OF- THE COMMENT ON. THE NOTIFICATION PRIOR TO RELEASE IF THE FUNDING YEAH I THINK WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON. THAT LIMITING IN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO ACT QUICKLY. PROVIDE AFFAIRS FUNDING THE IN A QUICK MANNER ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED THIS YEAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR WITH PROVIDING- THE MONEY TO THE FAIR IS THERE ARE A LOT OF. EXPECTED BEING THAT HAPPENED BUT WE DO NEED TO ACT QUICKLY. AND PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE FAIR AND SO GIVEN THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON ON TIGHT BUDGETS. ARE THERE THERE IS SOME CONCERN THERE ON- CAN REDUCING THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE THOSE- SHOVEL READY TO THE EXTENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S REQUESTED. THE QUESTION MAKE SENSE. MISTER CHAIR I CAN HANDLE THAT QUESTION AND YET AS I INDICATED BEFORE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIVE PROPORTION OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IDENTIFY NEEDS OUT THERE- THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF SHOVEL READY PROD PROJECTS THAT WE COULD PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS VERY QUICKLY- BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE ILLUSION THAT IT'S EASY TO DO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER CONTROLS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY GOES TOWARDS THOSE. SO IT'S YEAH WE DON'T SNAP OUR FINGERS AND DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY FOR THE PROJECTS WE HAVE A REVIEW PROCESS THAT WE LOOK AT THE PROJECT AND WE EVALUATE AND COMPARED TO A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS WE ALSO GET DGS INVOLVED TOO BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA WE DON'T HAVE- BUT YEAH THE PROJECTS A LOT OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN THE QUEUE FOR SO LONG THAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE THAT SHOVEL READY. SO WHO- THE THAT THAT PROCESS THAT YOU REFER TO. IF WE WERE TO ALLOCATE MONEY NOT THAT WE CAN DO IT BUT IF WE WERE TO DO IT TODAY- THAT PROCESS WOULD BEGIN. SOON AFTER TODAY. AS OPPOSED TO IF IT'S IN THE- UPCOMING YEAR'S BUDGET. IT CAN'T- THAT PROCESS WOULDN'T BEGIN UNTIL THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINS WITH IS THAT. ESSENTIALLY CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUTIS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED BIRD MAINTENANCE FUNDING. WE'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN TO TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS. AND SO WE HAVE BUILT PROGRAMMATIC EXPERTISE ON GETTING THE PROCESS STARTED SO WE ARE WE KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR THE FERRIS OF WORK THROUGH THIS BEFORE SO THEY KNOW WHAT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO US BUT THOSE VALUATIONS THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. SO YOU I DON'T I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT ALLOCATING THIS AND BUDGET YEAR MEANS THAT WE START SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH WHAT WE DO IS WE CONTINUE ON WITH SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. A LOT OF THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS ARE A- DEFECT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES ARE A- RESTAURANT. TYPE OF ISSUES. THANKS AND TOILETS AND THAT KIND OF THING. THAT RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE YEAH THERE ARE SOME ADA COMPLIANCE ESPECIALLY IN RESTAURANTS- ONE THING WITH A LOT OF THESE FAIRGROUNDS BEING PULLED INTO EMERGENCY RESPONSE THAT CAME UP IS THIS LACK OF FOOD PREPARATION FACILITIES AND THEN ALSO NOT JUST EIGHTY EIGHT BUT ADEQUATE RESTAURANTS THAT PROVIDE SHOWERING FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO END UP HAVING TO SPEND DAYS AND SOMETIMES WEEKS. BEING UNDER EVACUATION ORDERS SO YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND SOME OF THEM RUN TO VERY BASIC THINGS LIKE REPAIRING ROADS SO THAT THEY DON'T LEAK DURING THE RAINY SEASON AND REPAIRING AGING INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE WIRING OR- SEWER SYSTEMS OR WATER SUPPLY PIPES. HEATING UP OPEN SURFACES OF THE EQUIPMENT DOESN'T GET STUCK WHEN THEY'RE USING AS A STAGING GROUND SO YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS OUT THERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROJECT TYPES. TO INTERCEPT A COHORT OF- ESSENTIALLY EARLIER THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EARLY ACTION REQUEST- SO THAT YOU CAN GET STARTED ON THIS PROJECT AS SOON. AS POSSIBLE- TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A PRETTY ROUND NUMBER. I SUSPECT THAT THERE'S- ATYR CAPACITY THAT IF THEY'RE A LARGER ALLOCATION YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD- RAPIDLY AS YOU CAN WITH THOSE THAT ARE. ASSUMED TO BE UNDER THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS YOU'D BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD A RAPIDLY ON THOSE AS WELL IF WE WERE TO FULLY FUND TO ACCOMMODATE. ALL OF THOSE NEEDS THAT COULD BE HANDLED IN THE IN THE NEAR TERM. ASSEMBLY WHAT WOULD THAT NUMBER BE. YEAH I KNEW YOU WERE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AND I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOUR RESPONSE RIGHT NOW- IT WOULD BE MORE THAN THE TEN MILLION OBVIOUSLY AS I'VE INDICATED BEFORE- BUT ONCE WE MOVE BEYOND THAT IN SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE PREVIOUS ALLOCATIONS OF FUNDING THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE- THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER A WHOLE HOST OF NEW PROJECTS THAT. WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS- SO. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANYTHING TODAY- BUT IF YOU CAN GET THAT INFORMATION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY AS CHAIR I WOULD LOOK FAVORABLY ON- IN A IN A IN A YEAR WHEN WE- ARE BLESSED WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY- THAT THE FAIRGROUNDS. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE HISTORICAL USES- UGH UGH THAT THEY'VE BEEN PUT TO ARE. A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE STATE THAT- TYPICALLY DON'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION. THE THEY NEED TO BE READY ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE TO SERVE AS YOU DESCRIBED A VARIETY OF. NEEDS UGH UGH UGH ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS- WHO- IN A TIME OF. A COLD SNAP OR- EXTREME. HEAT NEED A PLACE TO GO TO- BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE THE- OF FACILITIES SO- FOR FIRES WHEREVER THEY MIGHT OCCUR IN THE STATE WE KNOW THAT OUR- FIRE SEASON IS EXTENDED NOW NEARLY- A TWO YEAR ROUND. AND THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO GET MORE AND MORE USE SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CATCH UP ON. OF SOME OF THE MAINTENANCE THE TO FOR THAT'S DEFERRED FOR A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE DON'T OFTEN THINK OF AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW NOT THAT THERE ARE UNIMPORTANT BUT WE- WHEN IT COMES TO FIRES WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT. A FIRE EQUIPMENT TRUCKS AND PERSONNEL AND THE LIKE- SO I'D LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET A LITTLE MORE HEAD OF THIS ISSUE AND APPRECIATED IF YOU'LL PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. NOW WE CERTAINLY WILL DETERMINE BLOOMIN WE ACTUALLY ARE VERY VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT YOU SHOW YOUR TODAY ND HAVE SHOWN IN THE PAST FOR THIS. WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO COME UP WITH THE LIST THAT INFORMS YOUR DECISION MAKING. GREAT THANK YOU- LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE TO DID YOU HAVE A I'M SORRY. YOU WERE GOING FOR YOU MICHAEL PLEASE MR BETHLEHEM TO ECHO YOUR COMMENTS I THOUGHT THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU- POINTING THAT OUT I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF COMMON SENSE THANK YOU. ISSUE NUMBER NINE IS THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS. AND IT'S OUR LAST ISSUE OF THE DAY. YES GOOD MORNING- SO JENNY LESTER MOFFETT AGAIN UNDER SECRETARY AT. HI I'M THIS LAST ISSUE IS THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM KNOWN AS WE- IT WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. TRANSACTION IRRIGATION SYSTEMS THE THINK WATER AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE STATE HAS INVESTED EIGHTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN THIS WEEK PROGRAMS. AND CDFA HAS MADE GRANT AWARDS TO EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS HARPER HOLDS A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR MOST ON OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAMS FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS WITH AN OVER SUBSCRIPTION RATE OF THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND ITS LEVERAGE OVER FIFTY POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN MATCHING FUNDS. WE ESTIMATE THAT SWEEP HAS RESULTED IN EIGHTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO REDUCTIONS AT THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER STATE ANNUALLY. ADFA IS REQUESTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS WELL AS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEXT YEAR I FIND IT DEPOSITIONAL PROJECTS UNDER THIS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL GRANT PROGRAM. BY THINKING CURRENT YEAR FUNDING WE CAN FUND PROJECTS AND MORE WORK ON THE GROUND AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE IN ANOTHER EXTREMELY DRY YEAR. THE QUESTION WAS RAISED BY THE LA- ABOUT THE NEED FOR EARLY ACTION ON THIS. EARLY ACTION FUNDING ALLOWS US TO GET CONTRACTS AWARDED EARLY. TO START WATER SAVINGS EARLIER AND GET PROJECTS ON THE GROUND EARLIER. IF WE GET FUNDING AS SOON AS AVAILABLE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT OUT. THE REQUEST FOR GRANT PROPOSALS AND AWARD THOSE CONTRACTS THAT WE CAN GET DONE. PROJECT ON IN THIS CALENDAR YEAR AS OPPOSED TO WAITING FOR NEXT YEAR TO PUT SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS IN THE GROUND. AND IMPLEMENT THE WATER AND ENERGY SAVINGS. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE REPORT QUESTIONS MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE OF I APPRECIATE SWEET PROGRAM THINK IT MAKES IT A LOT OF COMMERCENTRE.
