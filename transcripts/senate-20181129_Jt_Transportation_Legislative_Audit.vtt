00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.344
AUDIT -- IS

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:36.915
HELPFUL AND REINFORCING

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:53.465
PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED ISSUES

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:55.133
.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:29:11.182
THAT

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.719
in two issues highlighted in

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:17.021
that report so the auditor's

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:18.256
findings indicate that these

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.125
issues continue to be on going

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.627
and -- we want some answers from

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.329
our high speed rail authority

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.731
the the legislature's along

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.533
with the current and new in

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.135
ministration need to work

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:32.470
in partner Sir partnership

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:34.606
to determine what's next for

00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:36.040
the high speed rail authority

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.610
this year I offered -- the

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:41.546
bill SB eleven seventy two

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.481
that were removed many of the

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.216
duplicate measures there because

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.118
the latest in the authorities

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:49.621
property acquisition process

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:51.089
the bill was signed into law

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.190
by governor brown and will

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:53.725
say the state time and money

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.094
but this is not -- the only

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.695
thing we need to do is be

00:29:57.762 --> 00:29:59.998
eleven seventy two is just

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.699
the start this coming March my

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:02.634
committee will be holding an

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.335
oversight hearing to provide

00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:05.603
the authority the opportunity

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.639
to report back on our progress

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:09.541
and they have made relative to

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.776
these auditor's findings and

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:13.444
and completion of the business

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.346
plan this will be part of

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:18.249
hearing of for the authorities

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:20.485
-- update report we hope to

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.954
see this project development

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:25.356
on time and on budget schedule

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:28.526
-- we need to make some major

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:29.928
changes and we need to make them

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:32.330
now thank you thank you very

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.032
much next I'd like to invite

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:36.601
to assembly member Patterson as

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.269
a co request through the audit

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.005
Mister chairman thank you --

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.309
I would have to be pretty blunt

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.179
this audit has

00:30:48.713 --> 00:30:51.482
demonstrated to the

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:53.418
state of California what many

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:54.552
of us have been concerned about

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:57.088
for years now central California

00:30:57.155 --> 00:30:58.823
is the Canary in the coal mine

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.226
it is the Guinea pig and all of

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:03.628
this and to date we have spent

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.863
billions of dollars putting

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.198
up concrete that's gonna run

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.666
a rump rail road between just

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.735
outside Madera just outside

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:13.371
Bakersfield this audit

00:31:14.072 --> 00:31:16.307
along with other efforts to

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:18.142
get to the facts and the truth

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.611
that demonstrate that this

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:22.180
project is in fact collapsing

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.649
the last business plan came out

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:26.851
-- I suggested that it was

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.453
a going out of business plan

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.422
fact there's no money to

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:34.325
complete this fact you can't get

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:37.228
the disparate sections connected

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:41.199
fact the audit has

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:43.434
confirmed what many of us were

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.737
concerned about with respect

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:47.805
to the rush to put money out

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.440
when they did not have property

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:51.509
they did not have a plan with

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:54.112
respect to the location and

00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:57.148
relocation of utilities and this

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.417
what it says it was their

00:31:59.484 --> 00:32:01.919
fault that they knew it

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:04.055
going in and they made a

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:07.325
calculated decision to do it

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.894
and to not tell anybody

00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:12.997
and until there were a

00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:15.233
lot of concerns raised and

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.136
until a new executive director

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.570
Mister Kelly was put in place

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.839
we finally saw a business

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:24.642
plan that at least admitted

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:27.645
to those facts now

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:30.014
that that's

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:32.183
yesterday okay what's coming

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.218
tomorrow there is a federal

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.820
law that going on right now it

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:38.356
started in April and that

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.758
federal audit in part is

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:43.127
going to look at the mission

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:46.164
use of those funds early on

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:49.100
putting out billions of dollars

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:51.836
knowing full well they did

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.272
not have to property nor

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.207
plans to get the utilities

00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.211
relocated they've been caught

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.081
and there's going to be huge

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.683
consequence in the federal on

00:33:06.584 --> 00:33:08.953
number one you got to meet

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.288
their deadline this audit

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:11.823
says you're going to have to

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.625
move from very very slow slow

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.528
snail pace to warp speed

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.131
in four years just to

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.367
meet the deadline you fail

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.736
to meet the deadline or

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.804
the audit confirms that

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.539
that billions of dollars

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:30.208
were miss spent initially

00:33:31.109 --> 00:33:31.943
means that there's going to

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.111
be the real potential for a

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:35.279
multi billion dollar clawback

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:37.448
by the federal government

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:39.717
not that's where we are

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:43.087
all the happy talk all

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:46.190
the -- already rosy

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.359
press releases up all of

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.962
the -- aerial shots

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.397
from drones over a lot of

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:53.731
concrete in the air around

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:56.534
central California is

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:59.737
not reality reality

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.406
is embedded in this audit

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.275
and as we proceed I wanna

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.178
dealt a little bit deeper

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:10.748
into the -- because it is

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.651
of what I consider to be

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.586
this is borderline deceit

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.688
and we're going to have

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:18.756
to get to the bottom of

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:19.891
it and I think the federal

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.259
it's going to do that but

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:23.961
beyond that we have a time

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:26.697
problem here that I

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.499
think cannot be met

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:32.003
and so I think the

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.707
mind my intention my intention

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:38.776
was to to perhaps go into some

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:40.812
more detail with respect to

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.880
some of that earlier concern

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:43.815
but I'm not going to repeat

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:45.183
them I we all aye aye other

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.818
members here have said so

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:48.619
what I would think we need

00:34:48.686 --> 00:34:51.022
to be focusing on is what

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:53.491
the heck is your plan be

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.928
because plan nay has failed

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.698
and if you don't come

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:03.100
to terms with this this

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.970
project will die of its own

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.839
weight when you run out of

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:10.508
money it's going to end

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.276
and Fresno California is going

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:13.277
to be left with a bunch of

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.579
concrete in the air in a rump

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.481
railroad that's not good enough

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.418
thank you Mister Patterson

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.955
before we proceed with that

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:24.956
today's hearing I have a

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:27.191
few housekeeping items to

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:29.527
make sure that -- -- we're

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:32.096

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:34.332
of first I will be asking

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.635

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.138
of the audit findings and

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:44.008
recommendations -- that --

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:46.444
will be -- I asked the honor

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:47.778

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.480
minutes and and presentation

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:29.280
covered a variety of different

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.948
issues that -- the joint

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.016
legislative audit committee

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.985
and particulates senator bail

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.753
Assemblymembers Arambula and

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.188
and Mister Patterson asked us

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.522
to look at and that was related

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.625
to cost containment contract

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:43.494
management -- contracting with

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:45.763
small disadvantaged disabled

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.932
veteran business is looking at

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.667
their sustainability policies

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.636
looking at economic impacts

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:53.070
recall at the hearing Mister

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:54.705
around a lot particularly --

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.874
focused on that and then also

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.609
asking us to look to determine

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.177
whether or not there are any

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.746
additional opportunities for

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:03.014
the high speed rail authority

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.448
to expedite this project to

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.751
try to get it done more quickly

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:09.086
so we have issues with all of

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.254
those as some of the opening

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.223
comments mentioned clearly

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:14.959
there has been -- some

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:19.230
cost over runs delays in the

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.565
project as far as consistently

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:22.633
and the authority having to

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.302
consistently push deadlines out

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:27.972
as you know we audited this

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:29.473
project -- many many years

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.142
ago contract management wasn't

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.376
issue we identified in the

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.878
very first thought it we did

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.279
which was back in twenty ten

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.348
we also did another audit --

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:38.716
in twenty twelve which was a

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.518
follow up contract management

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.952
was a significant problem in

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.454
those audits and it continues

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.722
to be a problem and that is

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.390
something that really the high

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.858
speed rail authority needs to

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:49.727
focus on and one of the issues

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:51.629
tied to that that we discussed

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.863
in the audit report is there's a

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.032
reliance on contractors we are

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:56.634
not bringing in the authority

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.169
is not bringing in and hiring

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.304
state employees ought to be able

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.440
to do some of these oversight

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:03.374
or perform some of these

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:05.042
oversight responsibilities why

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.177
is that important because you

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:07.478
have contractors overseeing

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:09.146
other contractors and there

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:10.247
could potentially be a

00:39:10.314 --> 00:39:11.816
conflict of interest there you

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.583
INTEREST THERE YOU NEED TO HAVE

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.018
SOME STATE EMPLOYEES --

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.286
THE REASON I BRING THIS UP WE

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:17.455
ALSO LOOKED AT THEIR RESPONSE TO

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.123
THAT AND THEY AGREED AND THEY'VE

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.424
AGREED IN THE PAST.

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.893
WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.028
THEY WILL --

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.596
PUT A B. C. P. N. FOR FISCAL

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:26.864
YEAR.

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:27.398
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.432
LOOKING AT ANOTHER YEAR AND A

00:39:28.499 --> 00:39:30.367
HALF BEFORE THEY EVEN GET THE

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.569
FUNDING OR AT LEAST THEY'RE

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.237
PURSUING THE FUNDING TO HIRE

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.472
ADDITIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES WE

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:35.840
THINK THAT'S FAR.

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:37.708
TOO FOR FAR TOO LONG --

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.009
FAR TOO FAR OUT.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.010
SO -- THE

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.312
AUTHORITY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THAT

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.279
SO.

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.981
COST OVERRUNS DELAYS IN

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.750
CONSTRUCTION THE ISSUE WITH

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.284
RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL DOLLARS

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.652
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.688
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:51.689
TO THE AUTHORITY BUT TO THE

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:54.492
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE REFER --

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.160
TO GAO OPINION THE GOVERNMENT

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.428
ACCOUNTABILITY ARE FEDERAL

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:59.063
COUNTER POUT COMING APART THAT

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.664
AUDITS ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:03.300
GOVERNMENT ON BEHALF OF CONGRESS --

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.069
IN IN THAT OPINION IT MADE IT

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.437
VERY CLEAR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:08.272
INSTANCES IN THE PAST WHERE THE

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.040
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN EITHER

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:12.576
RECOUP FUNDS OR OFFSET FUTURE

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.646
FUNDS TO A STATE AND THEY HAVE

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.281
DONE THAT. ONE MINOR AMOUNT FOR

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.016
CALIFORNIA BUT THEY HAVE THAT

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.017
DON'T HAVE DONE THAT WITH SOME

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.286
OTHER STATES SO THAT A LOOMING

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.455
DEADLINE OF THE FEDERAL DEADLINE

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:25.823
IS DECEMBER.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.423
TWENTY TWENTY TO THE AUTHORITY

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:26.991
IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY WILL

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:30.427
COMPLETE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.295
TWO BUT EVEN AT THE BOARD

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.797
MEETING WHEN THEY PRESENTED THAT

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.498
INFORMATION TO THE BOARD.

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.699
OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OPERATING

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:36.867
OFFICER SAID WELL IT'S A VERY

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.602
VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE AND AS

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:40.171
WE INDICATE IN THE AUDIT REPORT.

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.705
THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:42.573
PERFORM.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.642
AT WORK AT TWICE THE PACE THAT

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:47.144
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SINCE

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:47.912
TWENTY THIRTEEN SINCE THEY

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:48.779
STARTED WORKING ON THIS

00:40:48.846 --> 00:40:50.548
PARTICULAR PROJECT --

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:52.283
THEY HAVE --

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.018
ENGAGED IN BLENDING MISSILE IS

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.586
ON A WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.187
ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND SOME OF

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:58.389
THE YOU KNOW THE OFFSETS OF

00:40:58.455 --> 00:40:59.523
BLENDING.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.524
WITH RESPECT TO THAT BUT THAT'S

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.294
CERTAINLY HAS ASSISTED IN IN

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.396
CONTROLLING COST MR WRITER HE IS

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.597
GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.399
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT --%

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:09.567
AGAIN THIS IS AN AREA THAT WHERE

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.602
WE WE FIND SIGNIFICANT ISSUES

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.704
THE OWN THE INTERNAL AUDITOR FOR

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:14.305
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.673
HAS IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:16.941
RESPECT TO THAT.

00:41:17.007 --> 00:41:18.676
POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT RESULTS

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.344
IN MORE CHANGE ORDERS --

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:21.879
WHICH INCREASES COSTS WHICH

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.215
PUSHES OUT TIME TIME IS MONEY AS

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:25.583
MR ARAMBULA SAID AT THE JAIL

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:26.550
LIKE HEARING.

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:28.485
SO THE MORE CHANGE ORDERS THE

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.720
MORE.

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:30.254
YOU'RE HAVING TO PUSH THE

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.256
PROJECT OUT THE COSTS ARE GOING

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.692
TO INCREASE ANOTHER CONCERN IS

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.694
THE MOST COMPLEX WORK THAT NEEDS

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.731
TO BE DONE IS IN THE FUTURE

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:41.265
WHERE THEY'RE CONSIDERING

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:41.565
TUNNELING.

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:42.166
AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.601
ABILITY TO DO ANY KIND OF

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.269
BLENDING OR ANY OFFSETTING SO

00:41:45.336 --> 00:41:47.238
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:48.539
THE THE COST OF THIS PARTICULAR

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:50.074
PROJECT IS GOING TO ESCALATE

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:55.145
EVEN MORE THAN IT HAS. TO DATE --

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.480
COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES AND THEN

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.715
I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER AGAIN

00:41:57.781 --> 00:41:59.984
SUSTAINABILITY WE ACTUALLY DID

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.219
HIRE AN OUTSIDE EXPERT A LOOKED

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.687
AT WHAT THE AUTHORITY A PUT

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.722
TOGETHER AS FAR AS THEIR

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.223
POLICIES AND AND THEY AGREED

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.224
THAT THEIR POLICIES LOOK PRETTY

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:07.892
GOOD.

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.693
BUT THEY DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.262
WITH RESPECT --

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:13.230
TO ANALYZING THE EFFECT OF

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.431
CONSTRUCTION THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:15.900
BASICALLY COMBINING EVERYTHING

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:16.934
AND REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.903
SUSTAINABILITY IN LOOKING AT A

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.804
PROJECT THAT'S COMPLETE HOW MANY

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:21.605
CARS ARE GOING TO COME OFF THE

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:22.806
ROAD -- IF

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.608
PEOPLE USE HIGH SPEED RAIL SO MR

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:25.542
REINER YOU'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:26.610
ABOUT THAT.

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:29.246
THE LAST ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:30.681
USE OF SMALL BUSINESSES JUST

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.682
DISABLED.

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:34.051
VETERAN BUSINESSES --

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:34.652
THEY SAID OF PRETTY LOFTY GOAL

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:37.254
OF THIRTY SAW IN SOME OF THE

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.390
WORK THAT WE ANALYZE THAT THEY

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:40.791
THEY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:42.026
SO THERE IS.

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:43.694
A FAIR AMOUNT OF BUSINESS THAT'S

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.329
GOING TO SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.463
AND CERTAINLY DISABLED VETERAN

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.465
BUSINESS IS WHAT WE THINK THEY

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:49.667
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF THERE

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.669
IS TRANSPARENCY THERE ARE SOME

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:52.803
CONTRACTS THAT THEY HAVE

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.171
EXEMPTED FROM.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:56.340
THAT REPORTING SO WE THINK THAT

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.875
THEY JUST NEED TO TO DISCLOSE

00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.209
THAT INFORMATION AND BE A BIT

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.678
MORE FORTHRIGHT WITH RESPECT TO

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:01.645
THAT.

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.080
SO WE DO HAVE A VARIETY OF

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:04.181
RECOMMENDATIONS ONE KEY

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.950
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WE TALK

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.318
TO CENTER BELL WHEN WE BRIEFED

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.919
HIM ON THIS REPORT IS.

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.020
REQUIRING THE AUTHORITY TO

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.622
PROVIDE QUARTERLY UPDATES TO THE

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.856
LEGISLATURE SO THAT THE

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:15.292
LEGISLATURE IS KEPT INFORMED OF

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.894
THEIR PROGRESS PARTICULARLY WITH

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.162
THIS DEADLINE.

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:19.964
OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.632
RELATED TO THE FEDERAL DOLLARS --

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:23.033
IN THE FEDERAL GRANT THAT THAT

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.301
CALIFORNIA RECEIVED FOR THIS

AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTION I'M

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:19.356

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.758
BLENDING THE SYSTEM WAS

PLANNED A STANDALONE DEDICATE

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.662
SYSTEM TO COVER SEVEN HUNDRED

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:27.331
MILES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:29.266
AND BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:33.971
AND BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:36.206
THE THE AUTHORITY HAD STARTED

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:38.308
IMPLEMENTING --

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:41.178
THE BLENDING PROCESS --

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.113
IT FIRST IN INTRODUCED BLENDING

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.915
IN ITS TWENTY TWELVE BUSINESS

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:46.283
PLAN --

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.951
DISSECT THE SEGMENT BETWEEN SAN

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:50.154
FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE WAS THE

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.522
FIRST --

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.090
SECTION TO BE BLENDED.

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:57.327
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT ADDED A-BLENDING OF A SECOND SEGMENT

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:57.961
BETWEEN GREAT.

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.497
BURBANK IN LOS ANGELES AND AGAIN

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.433
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT ADDED A

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:03.834
THIRD SEGMENT --

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.971
BETWEEN SAN JOSE AND GILROY --

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.873
THERE ARE TRADE OFFS --

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.442
THAT COME WITH BLENDING OF

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.509
BLENDING --

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:16.013
PROVIDES A LOT OF COST SAVINGS.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.015
FOR THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATED

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.450
COSTS -- WE

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:21.685
DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:24.054
COMPONENTS THAT WERE BLENDED AND

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.123
THERE IS ROUGHLY. TEN POINT NINE

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.424
BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:30.060
BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION TO

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.995
BLENDING --

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:36.867
SO WE SEE THIS IS A POSITIVE --

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:40.003
POSITIVE MECHANISM.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:40.804
WITH THE BLENDING COME STRAIGHT

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:44.842
OFF -- THE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.543
COST SAVINGS --

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:51.148
SORRY.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.216
WHAT POINTING?

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:52.916
THEY ARE SHARING TRACKING

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:54.084
CORRIDORS WITH OTHER REAL

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.252
PROVIDERS --

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:58.055
AND SO THERE ARE LIMITS ON THE

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:00.124
SPEED AT WHICH THE THE TRAINS

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.558
CAN TRAVEL IN THOSE SHARE

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.759
CORRIDORS.

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:03.827
ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:04.862
SHARING --

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.663
OPERATIONS WITH TO RUN THE

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.499
TRAINS THEIR LIMITED IN HOW MANY

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:09.933
TRAINS THEY CAN RUN SO THAT'S A

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.802
TRADE OFF AS COMPARED TO THE

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:13.437
DEDICATED SYSTEM.

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:15.772
THE THE IMPACTS AS THE SPECIFIC

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:19.743
IMPACTS OF THOSE --

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.044
TRADE OFFS --

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:21.979
THOSE -- THE

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:27.217
BLENDING.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.986
WILL NOT BE KNOWN AS NOT KNOWN

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:31.021
AT THIS TIME AND BECAUSE THEY

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:39.530
DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM BUILT --

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:41.632
WE ALSO DID AN ANALYSIS TO

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:44.034
COMPARE THE COSTS THAT WOULD

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:44.568
HAVE OCCURRED HAD THEY NOT

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:45.969
BLENDED --

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.605
AND ARE NOW ALSO SHOWS THAT THE

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:51.508
COST ESTIMATES WOULD HAVE BEEN A

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:52.676
HUNDRED AND 11%.

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:54.244
HAD THEY NOT BLENDED --

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.013
WITH THE BLENDING IT'S THE COST

00:46:56.079 --> 00:47:01.251
INCREASES ARE 81%.

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.653
WHILE BLENDING HAS REDUCE THE

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.555
SYSTEMS EXPECTED COSTS IT'S

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.323
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AS THE

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.823
STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.791
PREVIOUSLY.

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.393
THERE ARE NO MORE OPTIONS TO

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.028
BLEND THEY BLENDED EVERYWHERE

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:13.463
THAT THEY CAN.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.066
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY FIND

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.802
WAYS TO CONTAIN THE COST AND

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:21.371
DEAL WITH THE COST OVERRUNS --

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:22.739
SO THAT THEY CAN DELIVER THE

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:26.410
SYSTEM.

THEY DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.434
WERE ALLOWABLE THEY WERE NUMBER

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:12.702
UNABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE.

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:13.903
SO IN THAT INSTANCE WE MADE A

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:14.838
RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUTHORITY

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.272

THESE COMPLEX INVOICES ARE IN

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:29.219
FACT ACCURATE COMPLETE --

00:56:29.285 --> 00:56:30.754
THAT IS A MENTION IS THE ONLY

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.125
THEY WERE FAIRLY STRONG ISSUES

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.860
WITH IT WITH COMPLIANCE.

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.361
SO WE MADE A SUITE OF

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.896
RECOMMENDATIONS INTENDED TO

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:41.231

OR I SHOULD SAY.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.141
DEVELOP DEVELOPING A PROGRAM BY

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.650
WE FOUND THAT --

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:01.451
ALMOST NONE OF THE CONTRACT

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:02.585
MANAGERS WE REVIEWED HAD ANY

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:03.219

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.290
WE ALSO MADE A RECOMMENDATION AT

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:13.863
WHO ARE NOMINALLY RESPONSIBLE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:14.964
FOR DOING SO.

00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:16.432
IN THE EXISTING POLICIES AND

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:17.500
PROCEDURES BUT WE FOUND THAT

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:18.701
THOSE CONTRACT MANAGERS

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:19.803
SUPERVISORS DO NOT OUT WE'RE NOT

CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.040

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.108
FINALLY THE STATE AUDITOR

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:26.442
ALLUDED TO WE FOUND SOME ISSUES

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:27.911
WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERSIGHT OF

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.390
OVERSIGHT GROUP --

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:41.558
THAT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.559
PERIODIC REVIEWS OF CONTRACT

HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT THAT THAT

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.632
COULD BE DONE --

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:50.233
VERY LITTLE BASICALLY NEXT TO

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.535
NOTHING WITH RESPECT TO ACTUALLY

IN ADDITION TO THAT POTENTIALLY

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.223
CREATING AN ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUE

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.524

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:54.077
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT CERTAINLY

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.079
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.014
CONSISTENT FROM ONE AUDIT TO THE

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:00.316
NEXT -- AND

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.684
OF COURSE IT'S IT'S ONE THING TO

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.519
HAVE POLICIES ON PAPER IT'S

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.620
ANOTHER THING THAT TO ACTUALLY

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.456
IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES AS THEY

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.690
SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:10.393
EXECUTED WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.427
THESE ISSUES --

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.496
MISMANAGEMENT ISSUES AS SYSTEMIC

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.597
AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:17.133
THE AUTHORITY.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.901
WELL AS AS MISTER IT INDICATED

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:21.437
AT AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.639
INTERNAL AUDIT THEY DEVELOP SOME

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:24.240
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SO WE

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.408
LOOKED AND AS YOU INDICATE

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.876
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE ON

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.510
PAPER.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.544
THEY'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:30.012
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.981
IMPLEMENT THEM AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:33.783
HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.451
RELATED --

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.520
TO GETTING MORE STATE EMPLOYEES

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.988
SO YOU HAVE THAT INDEPENDENCE --

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:40.423
ALLOWING THE INTERNAL AUDITOR TO

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.525
DO THEIR THEIR WORK --

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.626
AND THEN.

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.828
REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.963
EXTERNAL EXPERTS I'M YOU

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.997
CERTAINLY NEED EXPERTS IN

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.565
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.400
PARTICULAR PROJECT BUT SOME OF

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.436
THE OVERSIGHT REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.538
DONE BY OUR STATE EMPLOYEES WHO

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.573
HAVE THE STATE'S BEST INTEREST

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:57.840
IN MIND.

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:58.641
SURE.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:02:59.842
LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.644
WITH YOUR EXPERTISE AND YOUR

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.379
EXPERIENCE AND OF COURSE YOUR

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:04.647
STAFF AND YOURSELF DOING THE

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.182
PREVIOUS I DO YOU HAVE FAITH

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.584
THAT THE ALL THE AUTHORITY WILL

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:09.752
IMPLEMENT [inaudible]

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.654
THE RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.589
WELL WHAT I HAVE SOME CONCERN I

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:14.757
MEAN IT'S SPEAKING AS THE STATE

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.459
AUDITOR I THINK THAT THE

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.927
AUTHORITY IN THE PAST HAS

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.495
SUGGESTED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.863
EMBRACE AND IMPLEMENT SOME OF

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.565
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:23.633
SOME OF AND SOME OF THOSE CASES

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:24.534
THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.302
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE REASON I

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.304
HIGHLIGHTED THE ONE RELATED TO

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.472
THEIR WITH.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.640
THEIR RESPONSE TO US --

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:31.807
CONCERNING.

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:34.744
A REGARDING THE STATE EMPLOYEES

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.045
GONNA SUBMIT A B. C. P. AND A

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.180
YEAR AND A HALF FROM NOW OR FOR

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.782
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.417
I WOULD HAVE HOPED OR WOULD HAVE

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.186
EXPECTED THEM TO WANT TO TRY TO

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:44.387
GET THAT DONE MORE QUICKLY

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:45.488
BECAUSE THAT'S AN ISSUE WE

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.490
IDENTIFIED FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.025
NOW IN FAIRNESS TO THE AUTHORITY

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:50.159
IN OUR FIRST AUDIT.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.427
THINGS WERE JUST GETTING UP AND

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.628
RUNNING AND YOU WOULD EXPECT YOU

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.398
WOULD BE RELIANT ON EXTERNAL --

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:56.999
CONSULTANTS TO ASSIST BUT YOU

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.168
NEED TO TRANSITION THAT THAT.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.870
KNOWLEDGE AND YOU NEED TO HAVE

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.471
THAT INTERNALLY WITH STATE

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.173
EMPLOYEE SO --

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.808
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN WITH

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.310
RESPECT --

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.912
TO HOW QUICKLY OR HOW --

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.847
VEHEMENTLY THE AUTHORITY WILL

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.783
IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.952
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS WHAT DOES

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.888
IT MEAN TO MAYBE --

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.122
A MARKETING.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:20.823
COMMENT ON THIS BUT WHAT DOES IT

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:21.490
MEAN WHEN YOU SAY ON PAGE FORTY

01:04:21.557 --> 01:04:22.158
THREE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF THE

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.593
DOCUMENTATION THAT PREVENTED US

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:24.894
REACHING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:25.828
QUALITY TIMELINESS.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.697
ACOSTA WORK PERFORMED UNDER

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:30.800
THESE CONTRACTS WHAT IS THAT DID

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:31.434
YOU ASKED FOR INFORMATION THEY

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:31.934
JUST GONNA PROVIDED --

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.002
THAT'S CORRECT THE THE POLICIES

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.104
AND PROCEDURES ARE VERY EXPLICIT

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.505
IN THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTATION

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.040
CONTRACT MANAGERS NEED TO CREATE

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.008
AND MAINTAIN.

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.509
DEMONSTRATING A RECORD OF

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.811
TRACKING THE TIMELINESS AND

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.179
QUALITY OF WORK AGAINST

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.681
ESTABLISHED CRITERIA AGAINST THE

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.349
CRIMES OF THE CONTRACT

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.450
FUNDAMENTALLY --

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:48.484
THIS HAS TO DO WITH RESPECT TO

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.353
THE DELIVERABLES OF THE

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:51.921
CONTRACTOR HAS.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:53.122
AGREED TO PROVIDE IN EXCHANGE

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.991
FOR ITS CONTRACTED RATE --

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.259
WE FOUND THAT NONE OF THE

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.960
CONTRACT MANAGERS THAT WE THAT

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.228
WE DID THAT WE TALK TO AS PART

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.930
OF OUR AUDIT MAINTAINED THAT

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:02.965
DOCUMENTATION --

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:03.833
AND MANY --

01:05:03.899 --> 01:05:07.036
WE'RE PERFORMING IF THE LITTLE

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.104
THAT WE COULD DISCERN ONE WAY OR

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.306
ANOTHER SO IT PRECLUDED US FROM

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.941
EVALUATING THEIR PROFESSIONAL

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.776
JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT JUDGMENT

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.111
HAD NOT BANDLEADER DOCUMENTED

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:15.411
[inaudible]

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:19.582
AND SEC.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:20.483
IT JUST TO TO THE STATE ARTIST

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.484
POINT IN IN KIND OF ADVOCATING

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.551
THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.053
DOCUMENTATION SEVERAL CONTRACT

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.388
MANAGERS.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:26.622
TOLD US AND CERTAINLY THE

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.291
DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED FOR THIS

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.659
OUT THAT THEY WERE IN FACT

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.360
RELYING ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.461
TO PERFORM A SUBSTANTIVE

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:33.696
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT DUTIES FOR

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:34.630
WHICH THEY ARE ACTUALLY

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:35.865
RESPONSIBLE SO THAT WAS A KIND

01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:37.800
OF A COMPOUNDING FACTOR OF THE

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:39.635
LACK OF AUTHORITY.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.137
DOT A FORTY GENERATED

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:43.172
DOCUMENTATION FOR US TO EVALUATE

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.940
IN TERMS OF CONTRACTOR WORK.

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:47.343
AND I JUST A QUICK SEARCH TO THE

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.377
DOCTOR AT THE DOT IT I MEAN THEY

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:49.345
WERE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED PROBABLY

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.080
CLOSE TO A HUNDRED INSTANCES

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.416
WHERE THERE IS A LOCKET LACK OF

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.418
DOCUMENTATION AND I COULD BE A

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.019
PLUS OR MINUS A LOFT.

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.955
IS THAT COMMON.

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:01.924
NO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:02.925
TYPICALLY SEE I MEAN

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.527
DOCUMENTATION IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:05.795
WE IDENTIFIED IN A LOT IN A LOT

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.096
OF AUDITS.

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:09.699
BUT THE THE SIGNIFICANCE OR THE

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.133
THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.468
IDENTIFIED IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.937
REPORT AND A NUMBER OF TIMES AS

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.172
I WAS JUST DISCUSSING WITH MR

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:17.106
WRITER IN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:17.640
IS.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:18.941
OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE WENT TO A

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.543
CONTRACT MANAGER IS SUPPOSED TO

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.078
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:23.245
THAT CONTRACT MANAGER WOULD

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.180
REFER US TO THE ACTUAL

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.314
CONSULTANT.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.782
UP FOR WHICH HE OR SHE IS

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:28.084
SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.752
OVERSIGHT TO GET THE ANSWERS

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.054
THAT IS NOT STRONG OVERSIGHT --

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.357
ON BEHALF OF THE THE AUTHORITY

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.959
SO THE THE THE NUMBER OF THE

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.894
VOLUME OF INSTANCES IN THIS

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:40.830
PARTICULAR AUDIT IS IS GREATER

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.798
THAN THAN WHAT WE TYPICALLY SEE

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.166
WHEN WE OUT WE GO OUT AND

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.901
CONDUCT ON AT WORK.

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.269
BY LAST QUESTION YOU AND YOU

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:47.937
FEEL FREE TO ANSWER THIS ANY WAY

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.772
YOU WANT BUT IF YOU ARE A

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.506
TEACHER AND YOU'RE GIVING A

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:50.940
GRADE.

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:53.542
IN TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT OF

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:56.345
THE AYE SPIRO HOW ABOUT AN

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:59.281
INCOMPLETE --

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:00.683
I I SITE ASKING.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.017
THAT'S NOT A PASSING GRADE AS I

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.586
INDICATED SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.521
THAT WE HAVE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.822
CONCERNS AND THEIR CONCERNS THAT

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.224
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY US IN THE

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:08.858
PAST.

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.760
AND CERTAINLY BEEN RAISED BY THE

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:12.695
INTERNAL AUDIT GROUP THE GAO

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.130
CAME IN AND DID SOME AUDIT WORK

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.998
SO IT'S NOT THAT THE AUTHORITY

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.433
AS MISTER PATTERSON INDICATED

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.567
THAT'S NOT THAT THE AUTHORITY

01:07:18.634 --> 01:07:19.835
HASN'T BEEN AWARE OF SOME OF THE

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:20.836
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:21.637
IN AUDITS.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.372
ALSO WERE AWARE OF SOME OF THE

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:24.540
ISSUES --

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.208
WITH RESPECT TO LAND ACQUISITION

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.843
IT CETERA WE FOUND SOME OF THAT

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.745
EVIDENCE AT WHERE THEY KNEW SOME

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.248
OF THESE CONCERNS AS FAR BACK AS

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:32.882
TWENTY THIRTEEN PERHAPS FURTHER

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:33.749
BACK THAN THAT.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.451
YET THEY DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.552
SO -- WE

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.154
REALLY DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.424
ABOUT PAST DECISIONS AND AND

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.192

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:47.196
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:48.531
THERE REALLY HAS TO BE SOME

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.965

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.799
REFLECTED THE TYPES OF

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:24.800
RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH THEY WERE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.836
BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE --

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.771
SO.

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:31.006
WHERE EVEN IF THEY WERE

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.108
QUALIFIED THEY WOULD WOULD BE?

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.109

MANAGERS THEY NEED TO BE DOING A

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:42.084
FULL TIME.

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:43.953
THEY NEED TO HAVE THAT BE THE

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.254
CLEAR EXPECTATION TERMS OF THEIR

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.422
THEIR TO THEIR TITLE OR

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:47.656

HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO IT.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.430
SO I'M JUST GOING TO THE OTHER

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.165
COMPONENT OF IT DID YOU HAVE AN

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.533
OPPORTUNITY --

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.801
TO SEE IF THE AUTHORITY BOARD

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:03.639
WAS QUALIFIED FOR OVERSIGHT.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.307
UP WHAT WE WHAT WE DID TALK

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.742
ABOUT IN THE REPORTED TO BE WE

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.210
WE WE ALLUDED TO REPORT THAT TO

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.678
SET OUT OR PUT OUT IN IN AUGUST

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.413
RELATED TO THE THE BAY BRIDGE

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.414
TOLL.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:15.084
GRAHAM THE RETROFIT AND WE

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.485
DETERMINED THAT --

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:18.521
INCREASED EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.089
THAT OF THAT PROGRAM AND MADE

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:21.824
HUGE STRIDES IN HELPING IT STAY

01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:23.259
CLOSE TO BUDGET AND PUSH BACK ON

01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:24.760
SOME SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.462
CHANGES TO CONTRACT AND TIME

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.029
LINES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:27.997
AUTHORITY.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.798
I WILL SAY THAT WE WE DO NOTING

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:32.801
THE REPORT LAERTES BETWEEN THAT

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.637
PROJECT IN THE AUTHORITY NAMELY

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:36.205
THE EXISTENCE OF THE AUTHORITIES

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.373
FOR OF DIRECTORS.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:37.973
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.476
NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED HOWEVER

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:42.478
THE YOU KNOW AS WE SAY THE

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.979
EXISTENCE OF THAT OF THAT BOARD

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:45.481
RECORDS HAS NOT ITSELF.

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.882
BY ITS NATURE PRESERVE PREVENTED

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.651
THE TYPES OF COST OVERRUNS AND

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:49.218
DELAYS THAT HAVE MANIFESTED

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.653
TODAY.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.754
SO THIS COULD JUST BE A POSITION

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:52.922
FOR THE PEER REVIEW GROUP THAT

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:56.292
THEY COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE OF

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.860
STEPPING UP THEIR ROLE

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:58.160
[inaudible]

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:01.130
SO THE WE'VE GROUP IS ALSO A

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.598
POOR COMPONENT --

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:03.699
OF EXT TAKE THE EXTERNAL

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.100
OVERSIGHT ALTHOUGH I MY

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:05.768
UNDERSTANDING THAT HASN'T UNTIL

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.770
RECENTLY BEEN FULLY STAFFED SO --

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.371
IN IN CERTAINLY IN DOING THAT

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.173
INCREASED OVERSIGHT IN ANY FORM

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.310
WOULD BE WOULD BE POSITIVE.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:15.911
SO ONE OF THE REASONS THE

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:16.879
AUTHORITY GIVES FOR NOT HIRING

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.147
MORE STATE WORKERS AT THE

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:22.952
PROJECT HAS A FINITE LIFESPAN --

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:23.953
I MEAN IT.

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:26.221
LOOKS LIKE IT IS MORE THAN MY

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.958
LIFESPAN --

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:29.925
AND THAT IS THERE.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.527
THAT THERE'S NOT MANY CONTRACT

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:33.062
MANAGERS IN THE STATE FOR

01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:33.295
SERVICE.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.463
ARE.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.366
MAYBE CALL FIVE MANAGERS --

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.234
HOW WOULD YOU WOULD YOU RESPOND

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.135
TO THIS?

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:41.403
SAID TAKE TO TAKE YOUR YOUR

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.738
COMMENTS OUT OF ORDER SIR --

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:43.672
I'D I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.107
ANALYSIS THAT THE AUTHORITY

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:45.574
PERFORM TO MAKE THAT

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.009
DETERMINATION BUT THE

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.544
AVAILABILITY OF THIS --

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:49.211
THIS TALENT IN THE STATE'S CIVIL

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:52.147
SERVICE POOL SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:52.848
THAT.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.550
I WILL SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:55.918
DURATION OF THE PROJECT.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:57.753
IF THE AUTHORITY IS TO HAVE ANY

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.254
PERMANENT ROLE WITH RESPECT TO

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.589
THE SYSTEM THEY WILL BE IN

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:02.024
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT --

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.259
THE AUTHORITIES NOT GOING TO BE

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:04.259
OPERATING AT SYSTEM IS NOT GOING

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.394
BE DIRECTLY MAINTAINING ITS

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.562
SYSTEM THAT WILL BE MANAGING

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:08.030
CONTRACTORS TO DO SO.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.565
SO I WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:10.933
NOTION THAT THESE ARE.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.568
LIMITED DURATION APPOINTMENTS

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:14.903
AND AS YOU POINT OUT SIR THAT.

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.072
EVEN IF IF THEY WERE TO FALL OFF

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.140
WHEN CONSTRUCTION THE SYSTEM IS

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.541
COMPLETE WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.010
YOU KNOW MORE THAN A DECADE OF

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.111
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.412
A I JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:26.148
PRESCRIPTIVE --

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.916
PROPOSAL WAS GENERATED BY THE

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:28.484
THE AUTHORITY WE WERE NOT

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.718
PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW THEY OBTAIN

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.755
THE STAFF AND WE IT'S DIDN'T

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.023
HIGHLY POSSIBLE THE AUTHORITY

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.624
COULD LOOK INTO SHARING STAFF TO

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.226
AND USE WITH OTHER AGENCIES SUCH

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.560
AS CALTRANS --

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.562
SO WE WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY OPEN

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.164
ABOUT HOW THE THIRTY CAN

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:42.931
ACCOMPLISH AND STAFFING NEEDS

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.700
THING TO GET THE AUTHORITY TO

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:45.501
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.802
SOON IT ALSO IN YOUR CAPACITY

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.504
DID YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.838
CHECK IN.

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.507
ON THE PROJECTS ARE UNDER

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.176
CONSTRUCTION OF THE FISSION SEES --

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.411
WHEN I WAS DWN THERE TOURING IT

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.046
LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.981
JUMPING AROUND TO MAKE WORK --

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.649
BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING RIGHT AWAY

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.518
ACQUISITION DID YOU HAVE THAT

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.253
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT THE THE

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.287
PROJECTS WERE.

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:09.591
BEING DONE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.460
MANNER.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.062
THE SPECIFIC --

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.630
CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCING WAS NOT

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:15.698
THE FOCUS OF OUR OF OUR AUDIT

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.700
HOWEVER WE YOU KNOW WE WE

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.634
OBVIOUSLY GET TO THE QUESTION OF

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:19.835
ASSISTANCE EFFICIENCY THROUGH.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:20.936
THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE APPLY TO

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.671
TRACKING PROGRESS TO DATE VERSUS

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:23.439
WHAT THE SCHEDULE PROGRESS

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.340
SHOULD BE AND FOUND THAT IT WAS

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:28.043
OBVIOUSLY LACK AND GIVEN TO THE

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.379
GROUND IF THEY NEED TO MAKE UP.

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.280
AND MY LAST QUESTION MISTER

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:31.513
CHAIR.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.681
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RIGHT

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:33.882
AWAY ACQUISITION --

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:36.351
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED HAVE

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:37.686
YOU.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.888
GIVEN ANY KIND OF RECOMMENDATION

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:42.324
ON HOW --

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.126
THAT THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.894
MAYBE LIKE THIS.

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.629
IS THERE A PLAN B. THAT IF IT'S

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:48.630
ONEROUS AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:49.364
LENGTHY PROCESS.

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:49.898
THAT MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:51.433
ANOTHER ROUTE TO GO INSTEAD OF

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.071
JUMPING AROUND WASTING MONEY OR

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.072
MAYBE HOPE YOU KNOW NOT HALTED

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.140
PROJECT LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN BE

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.443
MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.479
UTILIZING THE FUNDS.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:04.580
SO WE DID AND FORGIVE ME FOR NOT

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:05.347
MENTIONING DURING MY

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.448
PRESENTATION WE DIDN'T MAKE --

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.216
A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:08.951
SPECIFIC TO FUTURE CONSTRUCTION

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:10.753
CONTRACTING WORK --

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.554
NOTABLY ONE OF THOSE WAS THAT

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.656
BEFORE IN AND PROCURING

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.558
ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION WORK AT

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.092
PLANTS TO DO --

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.460
FIRST AND CHECK A PASS IN THE

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.028
COMING YEARS THAT THE AUTHORITY

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.497
NEEDS TO SET AND ACHIEVE

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:22.965
BENCHMARKS RELATED TO THE

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:23.866
ACQUISITION OF RIGHT AWAY

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:26.168
IDENTIFICATION AND RELOCATION OF

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.736
TOADIES AND CERTAINLY.

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.138
REQUIRED AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.739
PARTY STAKEHOLDERS TO PREVENT

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:32.441
EXACTLY THIS SORT OF SUCH

BECAUSE I THINK --

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.094
THE LEGISLATORS COULD BE VERY

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.296

THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

AS AS AS WAS STATED EARLIER THE

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:06.074

TO LA DOWNTOWN LA --

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:21.589
UNFORTUNATELY THE BETWEEN DID

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.791
THERE ARE NO CLEAR OPTIONS AT

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.293
THE AUTHORITY COULD USED --

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.961
TO TO YOU GET GET IN IN IN

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:28.730
COLLABORATION WITH EXISTING

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:29.297
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE IS

01:24:29.364 --> 01:24:32.167
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT THAT

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:35.904
WAS THE IN THE DIRECTIVE ON AUTO.

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:36.805
CORRECT CERTAINLY AND WE

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.773
IDENTIFIED IN AN EDIT NOTATIONAL

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.275
OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST --

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:41.209
IN ADDITION THE THE AUTHORITY

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:42.577
POINTED OUT THAT --

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:43.778
AND THIS IS A TRIBUTE TO THE

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.013
AUTHORITY BUT FOR THEIR TIME

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:47.482
TRAVEL ESTIMATES THEY ARE UP

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:49.517
AGAINST THE TO OUR FORTY MINUTE.

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.085
REQUIREMENT AND SO ADDITIONAL

BLENDING AS AS WE NOTED

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:54.322
PREVIOUSLY DOES CARRY WITH IT

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.957
LOWERED MAXIM TRAVELING SPEEDS.

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.125
SO THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:58.993
CONCERN FOR BINDING ADDITIONAL

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.562
SEGMENTS OF THE SISTER WAY COULD

OPTIONS THAT THEY ENGAGED IN AND

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.747
AS MUCH RIDER INDICATED THE

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.382
SEGMENTS THAT THEY FELT THEY

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.518
COULD USE CALTRAIN OR EXISTING

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:26.387
TRACK AND HAVE THAT PARTNERSHIP --

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.323
THEY THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:29.891

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.627
CONSTRUCTION IN THE AREAS --

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:34.963
THAT THAT REMAIN THERE IS NOT

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:37.599
THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE TRACK.

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.634

AS MISTER RIGHT INDICATED

REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE THIS TRAIN --

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.108
BE ABLE TO MEET TIME LINES AS

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.343
FAR AS TWO HOURS AND FORTY

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:49.511
MINUTES AND THEY'RE UP AGAINST

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:50.845
THAT THEY'RE WITHIN THREE

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.113
MINUTES OF THAT SO.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.815
THAT STATE LAW POTENTIALLY COULD

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:59.320
CHANGE THE TIMING OF OF HOW LONG --

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:00.455
HOW QUICKLY A TRAIN SHOULD BE

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.490
ABLE TO TO GET A PASSENGER FROM

INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.163
WE DIDN'T SEE ANY OPPORTUNITIES

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.532
AND WE CERTAINLY DEFERRED OF THE

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:11.766

WORKING WITH THEIR EXPERTS --

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.610
AND DID NOT SEE ANY ADDITIONAL

SAVINGS BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS IT

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.688
SLOWS THE TRAINS DOWN AND IT

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:35.156
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF TRAINS

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.090
INCLUDING FRESNO AND SO FORTH

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.992
THAT THAT DO IDENTIFY THOSE

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.694
VALUE CAPTURE TECHNIQUES AS A AS

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.429
A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY GOING

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:15.229
FORWARD.

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:17.532
HOWEVER WE DETERMINE THAT THE

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:18.199
THE THE STATION PLANNING PROCESS

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.401
IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY AND SO

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.070
WHILE THOSE THOSE AT THIS

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:22.737
TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY HOPE PROMISE

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.405
AND NOW IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR US

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:26.140
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE.

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:26.741
IN THE AUTHORITY WAS GOING TO

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:31.045
MOVE ON THEM OR FOR THAT

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.047
DECISION WAS GONNA BE BENEFICIAL.

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.616
DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:35.950
OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE FURTHER

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:38.620
EXPLORED.

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:39.988
YEAH I I YEAH I BELIEVE SO I

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.857
BELIEVE THAT THAT'S IT'S AN OPEN

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:43.691
A POTENTIALLY VERY INNOVATIVE

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:44.292
WAY OF HELPING OFFSET SOME OF

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.159
THE THE COST FOR SYSTEM THAT

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.961
NEEDS ALL THE HELP I CAN GET IN

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:49.564
TERMS OF REDUCING COSTS.

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:50.164
DO YOU --

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:53.968
DID YOU EXAMINED --

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.471
THE TUNNELING ASPECT ENTERS

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:59.073
EXPEDITING --

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.708
CONSTRUCTION TIME LINES THROUGH

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.644
THE TUNNELING OF THE TOTALING

01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:08.683
ELLO ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:09.183
SINCE I NOTICE ARE NOT

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:09.751
SPECIFICALLY WE BEYOND THE

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:10.418
KNOWLEDGE IN THAT TUNNELING IS

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:11.152
GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT OF A

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.387
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TECHNICAL

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.788
DIFFICULTY THAN EXISTING

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:14.355
CONSTRUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:14.889
PLAYING WITH THE LAYS.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.391
THE OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.259
IN THE REPORT THAT --

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.394
YOU KNOW THE PAST COULD COULD

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.662
REOCCUR REEKER IN TERMS OF

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.196
DELAYS TO THE PLANNED SCHEDULE

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.431
FOR TUNNELING BUT WE DON'T HAVE

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.033
ANY TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.267
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ALIGNMENTS.

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:31.272
SO FURTHER EXPLORATION.

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:31.873
CERTAINLY PUT THAT IN THAT

01:28:31.939 --> 01:28:33.608
CATEGORY --

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:37.211
WE HAVE SP ONE OH NO LOG THE

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:39.747
VOTERS APPROVED THE BY REJECTING

THE AND INITIATIVE --

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.953
WE HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL --

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:46.921

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:49.691
HAVE YOU OF CONSIDERED --

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:52.694
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL --

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.063
ROLE IN OVERSIGHT ON HIGH SPEED

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.632
RAIL AUTHORITY.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:29:00.201
OF FUNDING AND WITHOUT --

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.870
BE OF ASSISTANCE.

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.105
TO US THE LEGISLATORS TO GET

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.973
REPORTS.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.309
ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LIKE THEY

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.644
REPORT ON OLDER TRANSPORTERS

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:12.180
SUPPOSED TO REPORT ON ALL.

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.782
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS --

01:29:14.849 --> 01:29:16.818
TO OUR COMMITTEE --

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.386
OUR COMMUNITIES OF BUDGET

COMMITTEES AND POLICY COMMITTEES.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.592
THE AFFECTED SPECTER GENERAL

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:27.095
SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN OVERSIGHT.

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:29.197
ON HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT.

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:30.364
ABSOLUTELY I THINK HAVING ANY

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.633
EXTERNAL THEY WOULD BE EXTERNAL

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.368
TO THE AUTHORITY AND BE WOULD BE

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.137
REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.672
THEY WOULD BE ABLE.

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.340
TO DO CONDUCT WORK MORE

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:40.408
FREQUENTLY --

01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:44.879
pSUPPORT I THINK THAT'S A AN

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.647
EXCELLENT IDEA THAT THEY MORE

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.216
OVERSIGHT AND MORE FREQUENT.

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.517
CHECKING IN WITH THE AUTHORITY

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.786
AND HAVING THAT EXTERNAL AUDITOR

01:29:51.853 --> 01:29:53.454
BEING ABLE TO REPORT TO YOU --

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:56.524
AT THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW WELL

01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:57.725
THE AUTHORITY AS A DRESSING

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.093
RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESSING

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.828
DIRECTIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.630
I THINK IS A POSITIVE --

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.298
A POSITIVE THING FOR THE STATE

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.501
THE THE OF THE FORTY AN

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:07.635
INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS PRETTY

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:10.905
BROAD WE WE LEFT IT BROUGHT ON

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:12.707
PURPOSE.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:14.709
CORRECT JIM AND IT WAS DONE.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:16.778
IT SAID ANY TRANSPORTATION

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:18.513
DOLLARS IN THE CALIFORNIA.

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.548
SO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DOESN'T

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:23.251
NEED ANY LEGISLATIVE.

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:25.453

PROJECT CERTAINLY IN ANYTHING

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.132
OUR OFFICE COULD DO TO ASSIST

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.634
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS FAR AS

CALTRANS ONLY INSPECTOR GENERAL

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:07.895
SO THIS WORK ON IN MY ROOM MY

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:11.666
WAY I THINK WE ALREADY OUT THERE.

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.801
HOOKS INTO --

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:14.735
IF YOU WANT TO SET UP

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.036

ONE THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.873
MISTER PATTERSON --

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:19.807
I WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:20.141
QUESTIONS --

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.776
THE BE SIMILAR QUESTIONS THAT I

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:23.444
ASKED TO THE AUTHORITY FIRST OF

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.112
ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE MEETING

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.715
THE DEADLINE --

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.383
WE'VE GOT TWO ISSUES HERE THAT

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.252
ARE OF DEEP CONCERN FOR ME I

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.486
THINK AND I THINK YOU HAVE

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:33.554
EXPRESSED AS WELL.

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.323
THE EARLY USE OF THE FEDERAL

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.825
MONEY WHICH I THINK EXPRESSLY

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:39.560
DEMONSTRATES THAT.

01:31:39.627 --> 01:31:41.662
I THINK THE FEDERAL WHAT IT IS

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.297
GOING TO HAVE --

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:44.465
GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT.

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:47.835
AND SECONDLY THAT THAT THE THE

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:49.303
DEADLINE THAT THAT THE THE TIME

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.738
HERE.

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:52.473
YOUR AT YOUR SAYING THAT IT

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.475
NEEDS TO YOU NEED TO DOUBLE.

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:57.979
THE CONSTRUCTION IN FOUR YEARS.

01:31:58.045 --> 01:32:00.681
THERE IS MY MIND NO INDICATION

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:03.084
THAT PREVIOUS HISTORY AND

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.385
EXPERIENCE.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:06.187
CAN EVEN BEGIN TO APPROACH THAT

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.322
EXPECTATION SO I THINK THERE IS

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:11.425
A SERIOUS QUESTION GOING FORWARD.

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:13.861
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.997
FEDERAL AUDIT.

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:19.333
WHAT IS YOUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL?

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.968
IN THE ABILITY.

OF THIS STORY UNDER YOUR AUDIT

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:25.773
AND WHAT YOU KNOW TODAY. TO MEET

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.075
THAT DEADLINE AND AVOID THE

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:29.844
POTENTIAL.

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:32.513
OF CLAWBACK IN OTHER WORDS.

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:36.484
WHAT IS PLAN BE?

01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:37.718
WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD DEFER

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.086
TO THE AUTHORITY FOR PLAN B. --

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:40.421
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION THAT'S

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:42.423
WHY WE RAISED IT AS A CONCERN IN

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.191
THE AUDIT REPORT WE WERE VERY

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:45.059
CONCERNED.

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:46.994
AND AND AS I INDICATED IN MY

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.329
OPENING COMMENTS THE THE

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.630
AUTHORITY ITSELF WHEN IT

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.699
PRESENTED THEIR PLAN TO THE

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:52.700
BOARD --

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:55.202
QUALIFIED AND SAID THIS OF

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.871
SCHEDULE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.005
MEET THE FEDERAL DEADLINE OR TO

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.141
MEET THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:00.775
WHICH IS THE DEADLINE THEY'VE

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.243
SET FOR THEMSELVES BUT THE

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.745
FEDERAL DEADLINE IS DECEMBER.

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:05.413
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S WHY

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:06.881
WE DID THE ANALYSIS TO

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.716
DEMONSTRATE. TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.184
ACCOMPLISH THIS THE AUTHORITY

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.320
HAS TO YOU KNOW WORK TWICE AS

01:33:12.386 --> 01:33:14.789
QUICKLY AS IT HAS THUS FAR AND

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.958
WE HAVE WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.125
ABOUT THAT.

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.126
WHETHER TO CHI MOBILE SO THEY'RE

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:19.894
DOING THE APT DESCRIPTION HERE

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.896
IS ONGOING SERIOUS CONCERNS

01:33:21.963 --> 01:33:22.830
GOING FORWARD TO MEET THE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:25.166
DEADLINE THAT IS THAT IS A FAIR

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:28.970
ASSESSMENT OF ONE ON ONE ALSO.

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.104
THE THE THE GENERAL --

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:32.907
VALUE PROPOSITION --

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.742
OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT WAS --

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:37.411
PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS.

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.913
I THINK CAN'T THREE ELEMENTS TO

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.315
IT SPEED TIME AND

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.149
COMPETITIVENESS.

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.617
WE ARE NOW HERE [inaudible]

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:45.453
YEARS LATER.

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:48.489
THE SPEEDS ARE GOING DOWN.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:50.524
THE TIME IS GOING UP.

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.293
AND THE COMPETITIVENESS WITH

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.161
OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION I

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:56.030
THINK IS GOING DOWN.

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:58.499
AS A RESULT.

01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:03.904
THE ARC OF THIS PROJECT APPEARS.

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:11.345
THE KIND OF SPEED TIME AND

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.647
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WAS

01:34:13.714 --> 01:34:17.651

EACH YEAR THERE'S NOT THERE AT

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.030

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.331
TO CHIU SOMETHING WHERE THEY CAN

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:31.432

COMPETITIVENESS.

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:40.608
VALUE PROPOSITION THAT I THINK

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:41.909
THE THE LONGER THAT THE

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.244

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.413
DECISIONS. TO SCALE BACK AND

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:47.314
SCALED DOWN --

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:50.518
THE SPEEDS PUSH THE TIME'S UP IN

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:51.952
THIS ISSUE THAT'S GOING.

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:54.622

TRAINS EVEN THOUGH BLENDING.

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:13.607
HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.609
COST OF THE PROJECT BY REDUCING

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:16.343
COSTS.

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:18.312

THE NUMBER OF TRAINS THAT WILL

01:35:28.789 --> 01:35:30.291
BE ABLE TO RUN --

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:32.193
AS FAR AS THAT TRACK THAT

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.566
WHEN SOMEONE'S MAKING A CONSUMER

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:06.533
BIGGER THAN WE TYPICALLY SEE IN

AN ARTICLE OFTENTIMES A FOR

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:10.904

IT WAS.

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:22.282
MULTIPLE INSTANCES AND NUMEROUS

PARTICULAR DELIVERABLES --

01:45:44.071 --> 01:45:44.671
FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOSE IN

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:45.939
THE STATE YOU KNOW THE PAYMENT

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:48.075
TO RT P. WAS CLOSE TO TWO

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.276
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO A

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:51.311
PROJECT OF THIS SIGNIFICANCE WE

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:52.646
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE.

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:54.548
TIGHTER CONTROLS STRONGER

AND WE'RE JUST NOT SEEING THAT --

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.992
AND IT IS IT IS CONCERNING

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:07.294
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF THE

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.995

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.797
PARTICULAR PROJECT AND IT IS

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:11.932
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:14.601
TYPICALLY SEE IN OTHER AUDITS --

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:15.869
CERTAINLY AUDITS THAT WE'RE

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:17.738
LOOKING AT THAT ARE NOT OF THIS

01:46:17.804 --> 01:46:19.940
PARTICULAR MAGNITUDE AS FAR AS

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.408

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.585
TO NUMEROUS --

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:32.853
INCIDENCE OF THE LACK OF THESE

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:36.056
CONTROLS AND THE LACK OF TRANS --

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:39.793
BASED ON YOUR OVERALL --

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.261

ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:47.334
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO WHY

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.303
THIS APPEARS TO BE.

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.239
THE CASE BOY THAT'S A DIFFICULT

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:54.307
QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT IT

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.076
IT IS A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:58.111
MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PAST

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.213
THE THEIR OWN INTERNAL AUDITORS

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.782

GENERAL PARTICIPATE AS FAR AS AN

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.819
EXTERNAL ENTITY --

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:07.354
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT TO

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.156
THE LEGISLATURE I REALLY DON'T

01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:10.590

FOR THE AUTHORITY FOR YEARS NOW

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:39.119
SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:40.520
A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT THAT THE

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:42.355

INSTANCES OF RTP CONSULTANTS

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:04.144

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.150
THEIR PERSPECTIVE MAY BE I MEAN

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.418
WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:13.220
STATE AGENCIES AND I CAN DIFFER

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.020
STAFF WE'VE HEARD.

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:15.355
THIS FROM THE AUTHORITY

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.958
OFTENTIMES STATE PROJECTS BECOME

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.526
SO DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:21.094
CONSULTANTS WE'VE SEEN THIS AND

TRANSFER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:28.368

ALLOW MY STAFF TO ANSWER IF THEY

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:47.454
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD BUT I THINK

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.656
IT IS CONCERN ABOUT WE'VE GOT TO

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:51.157
KEEP THIS PROJECT GOING WE'VE

01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:53.093
GOT A DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE SOME.

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:54.728
LANGUAGE IN THE REPORT WHERE.

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.029
THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD WAS

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:57.163
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.632
GRANT BUT WE WANT TO DEMONSTRATE

01:48:58.698 --> 01:49:00.066
TO THE VOTERS WHO APPROVED

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:01.768
PROPOSITION THE BONDS.

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.170
THAT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:06.039
SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FOR

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:07.507
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IT IT

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.243

CONCRETE ON THE GROUND IT CETERA

01:49:11.444 --> 01:49:13.413
SO I THINK I THINK THAT SOME OF

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.981
THE PERSPECTIVE PERHAPS AT THE

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:17.684
AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE I DON'T

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:19.853

YEAH WOOD MISTER FRAZIER WE

01:50:12.839 --> 01:50:14.407
DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.576
PROPOSITION ONE A AND COMPARED

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.712
IT TO WHAT WE SAW AS FAR AS

01:50:18.778 --> 01:50:20.280
PROGRESS THE AUTHORITY HAD MADE

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:21.247
SO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.816
ABILITY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.117
I APOLOGIZE.

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:25.518
THE OTHER WAS THAT IN THE IN THE

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:28.154
BALLOT [inaudible]

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:30.023
FOR NOT.

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:33.460
A PRICE THAT WAS SET FOR FAIR.

01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:37.097
FOR THE FARE TO RIDE THE HE OR

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:38.365
WAS IT IN SOME KIND OF DOCUMENT

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:40.200
SAID THAT WHAT IT WOULD COST

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:41.568
RIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:42.669
WHAT IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:50:42.736 --> 01:50:45.638
COST WOULD BE NOW IT IN TODAY'S

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:46.172
DOLLARS I'M HERE IS ALMOST

01:50:46.239 --> 01:50:47.374
DOUBLED?

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.842
I AGAIN WOULD WHEN I'M LOOKING

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.143
AT STAFF AND THERE'S THERE TELL

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.344
ME WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:52.812
INFORMATION SO AGAIN I WOULD

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:53.813
DEFER TO THE AUTHORITY FOR THE

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.215
ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK WE

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.183
NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IF

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.319
THE SAYING IS AFFORDABLE DRUG.

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:01.021
YOU KNOW TO WRITE ON IT MOVES

01:51:01.087 --> 01:51:04.424
FORWARD [inaudible]

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.026
YES.

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:06.693
ON THE LAST POINT WHERE YOU SAID

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.128
THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE TO TRY

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:09.562
TO SHOW SOMETHING. TO

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:12.532
DEMONSTRATE SOMETHING VISIBLE ON

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.867
PAGE THIRTY DIGITAL TRIGGERED

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.435
THIS THAT YOU YOU RIGHT.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.536
OR IN THE AUDIT THAT STORY

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:18.571
REPORTED TOTAL COST ESTIMATES

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:20.607
WHEN BEGINNING CONSTRUCTION IN.

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:21.141
TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WERE

01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:22.909
UNREASONABLY LOW CAN YOU EXPOUND

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:24.677
ON HOW YOU CAME TO THAT

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:27.213
CONCLUSION SO IS UNDER THAT WITH

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.415
DID DID THEY KNOW THE ROUTE BUT

01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:31.684
THE COSTS WERE LOW AND THEY JUST

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:34.020
SAID IT ANYWAYS.

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:34.854
WHAT SERVER THEY CERTAINLY KNEW

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:35.422
WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:51:35.488 --> 01:51:36.656
ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO PLACE

01:51:36.723 --> 01:51:37.290
RELIABLE DOLLAR MONTH ON THOSE

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:38.658
COSTS THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT WE

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:40.160
REFER TO IN THE REPORT FOR POINT

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:40.894
OF COMPARISON?

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.562
HAVE TO DO WITH THOSE IN THE THE

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:44.197
CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER OF

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.065
PROVISIONAL SUMS UP THE

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:46.800
AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED WHEN

01:51:46.866 --> 01:51:47.367
EXECUTING EACH OF THE THREE

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:49.202
CONTRACTS.

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:51.571
WE COMPARED THOSE TO THE THAT

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.339
CHANGES TO DATE THE COSTS OF RUN

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:54.340
TODAY AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:55.175
FUTURE AND THAT'S THE BASIS FOR

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.509
OUR CONCLUSION ABOUT.

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:59.579
THE ON RECENTLY LOW NATURE OF OF

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:02.649
THE WRITTEN OUR POINT ABOUT THE

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:04.250
ON REASON THIS THOSE NUMBERS IS

01:52:04.317 --> 01:52:05.852
REALLY ROOTED IN.

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.787
AUTHORITIES KNOW IN KNOWN

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:11.291
UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING --

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:12.225
THESE ISSUES AND THAT.

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:14.027
THEY COULDN'T PUT A GOOD NUMBER

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:15.628
ON THEM BUT IT'S LED TO FORGIVE

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.831
ME BUT IF IT'S ONE THING TO SAY

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.165
I DON'T KNOW.

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.700
IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY I

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:21.968
DON'T KNOW BUT THIS IS THE

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:22.202
NUMBER.

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:24.804
CORRECT.

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:25.672
I WOULD AGREE INSOFAR AS YES

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:27.774

A SEVERAL CONTRACTS WITH A

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.479
CONTINGENCY AMOUNTS THAT WERE

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:34.314
INADEQUATE SO.

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.149
SO THE NUMBER THEY PUT OUT.

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:38.485
WAS JUSTIFIED HOUSE IF THEY

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:42.689

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:13.259
THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE AND

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:13.926

02:22:47.091 --> 02:22:48.126
WITH WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE HAVE --

02:22:48.192 --> 02:22:50.528
I THINK TODAY WE HAVE FORTY NINE

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:51.829
CONTRACT MANAGERS.

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:53.898
EVERY CONTRACT WE MET MANAGER WE

02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:54.899
HAVE IS A STATE EMPLOYEE

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:55.199

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.701
OKAY GOOD.

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:57.468
OKAY I THINK I THINK THIS IS

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.904
IMPORTANT ISSUE IF YOU WANT TO

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:02.106
RAMP UP THOUSAND GET THE

02:23:02.173 --> 02:23:03.474
POSITIONS FILLED YOU HAVE TO BE

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:05.009
YOU HAVE.

02:23:05.076 --> 02:23:07.245
TO YEAH PAY THEM ADEQUATELY

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:09.614
COMPETITIVE.

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:10.548
YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:12.216
CIVIL SERVICE.

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:13.952
I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING THE

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.186
DAUGHTERS RECOMMENDATION HAVING

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:16.721
A TEAM.

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:18.690
DAD HAS CONTINUITY THAT STICKS

02:23:18.756 --> 02:23:20.024
TOGETHER.

02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:20.858
THAT BECOMES --

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:22.160
THE KNOWLEDGE CENTER OF THE

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:23.761
PROJECT.

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:25.163
TERMS OF MANAGING AND

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:27.065
CONSTRUCTING THE PROJECT.

02:23:27.131 --> 02:23:28.366
HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE CENTER SO

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:30.702
IMPORTANT IN COMPLETING A

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:32.203
PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET.

02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:33.604
SO IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE

02:23:33.671 --> 02:23:35.873
OF THE COME COMPETITION ON THE

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:38.042
SALARIES.

02:23:38.109 --> 02:23:41.479

FOR YOU.

02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:43.982
YEAH AND I THINK --

02:23:44.048 --> 02:23:45.883
TO ME THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:47.485
IT IN A GREEN WITH THE

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:48.886
RECOMMENDATION WE WANT THAT TEAM

02:23:48.953 --> 02:23:50.221

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:52.023
THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT SO.

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.091
I I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A

02:23:53.157 --> 02:23:54.025
WASTE.

02:23:54.092 --> 02:23:58.830

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:07.638

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:10.241
CENTER FOR THE PROJECT.

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.110
YES SURE YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:14.012
HIGHER CANCELED BECAUSE THEY

02:24:14.078 --> 02:24:15.513

02:24:19.317 --> 02:24:21.352
CORRECT BECAUSE THE LESS.

02:24:21.419 --> 02:24:25.356
LESS OF A SENSE OF URGENCY ON

02:24:25.423 --> 02:24:27.992
THE PROJECT.

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:32.964

02:24:33.031 --> 02:24:34.365

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:41.305
URGENCY MAYBE A NEW.

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:43.441

I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:57.522
STRUCTURAL THING.

02:24:57.588 --> 02:25:01.826

A MISTAKE.

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.011
BASED ON THE ABILITY TO GET

COST OVER RUNS.

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:54.839
A REALLY UNDEFINED CAUGHT

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:57.875
UNDEFINED AT THE TIME --

02:26:57.942 --> 02:26:59.277

WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE THE BALK

02:27:09.554 --> 02:27:11.889
OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BUT THOSE

02:27:11.956 --> 02:27:14.358
THOSE COSTS IF THEY HAD BEEN

02:27:14.425 --> 02:27:16.661
ABLE TO BE DEFINED AT THE OUTSET.

FUNDING CONTINGENCY WE CLEARLY

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:32.143
UNDER ESTIMATED BOTH.

COULD HELP CLEAR --

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:52.230
WE INCORPORATED DOES IN THE TWO

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:53.497
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN PLAN.

02:27:53.564 --> 02:27:56.801
THE THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WENT

02:27:56.867 --> 02:27:58.636
ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND DURING

02:27:58.703 --> 02:28:01.205
THAT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE

02:28:01.272 --> 02:28:02.740
TIME WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION.

02:28:02.807 --> 02:28:05.409
AND INTO THE TWO THOUSAND

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:06.877
SEVENTEEN TIME FRAME WE'RE

02:28:06.944 --> 02:28:09.113
PRETTY COMPLEX --

02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:11.082
WITH A LOT OF PUSHING AND

02:28:11.148 --> 02:28:12.750
PULLING WITH REGARDS TO WHAT.

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:15.286
THE THIRD PARTY PARTNERS ARE AT

02:28:15.353 --> 02:28:17.888
CONTRACTORS ARE THE THIRD PARTY --

02:28:17.955 --> 02:28:19.924
AGREEMENTS THAT IF PEOPLE ON THE

OTHER SIDE OF THOSE AGREEMENTS

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:23.594
WANTED --

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:26.464
INTRUSION BERRIES WERE ONE OF

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:27.331
ROACH.

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:28.432
SHOW -- THEY

02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:29.333
WEREN'T THINGS THAT WE COULD

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.569
EITHER ONE DIVINE DEFINED

CLEARLY BEFORE NOW.

02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:36.207
AND SECONDLY WITHOUT QUESTION.

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:37.375
THEY WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT

02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:39.310
WE CONTEMPLATED BUT WHEN WE LOOK

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:42.146
AGAIN IT DID THIS MAKE SENSE. TO

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:43.581
TAKE THREE AND A HALF BILLION

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:45.383
DOLLARS.

02:28:45.449 --> 02:28:46.651
THOSE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE

02:28:46.717 --> 02:28:48.085
IF WE COULD HAVE TO FIND AND

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:49.053
THEN WE WOULD HAVE LOVED IT THEN

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.321
THE ONES DOING THAT AND WITH A

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:52.256

BACKGROUND WE BOTH UNDERSTAND

02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:57.328
THAT.

02:28:57.395 --> 02:28:58.863
AND WE WOULD WE WOULD.

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:01.465
HAVE TO TAKE SOME PRETTY SEVERE --

02:29:01.532 --> 02:29:03.534
CONDITIONS BEFORE WE WOULD AGREE

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.603
TO START SOMETHING WITH THE LACK

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:07.371
OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAD IN

02:29:07.438 --> 02:29:08.606
CERTAIN AREAS.

02:29:08.673 --> 02:29:10.474
BUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:12.410
DOLLARS OF FUNDING THAT WE HAD

02:29:12.476 --> 02:29:14.345
NO -- REASON

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:30.928
WE THINK THAT WE ARE LIKELY

02:29:30.995 --> 02:29:33.431
FACING MAYBE AS MUCH AS THREE

02:29:33.497 --> 02:29:35.633
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION MORE.

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:38.302
IN THE LAKE GOOD DELAY COST IN

LARGE EX CONVICTS REASON FOR

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:41.505
BEING.

02:29:41.572 --> 02:29:43.274
AFTER WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION

02:29:43.341 --> 02:29:45.209
WE'RE GETTING READY WE WERE HELD

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:46.911
UP FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF

02:29:46.977 --> 02:29:50.047
LIQUID LITIGATION --

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.082
THAT'S WHY IT IS IT WAS

02:29:51.148 --> 02:29:52.616
MENTIONED WE HELD BACK ON IT

02:29:52.683 --> 02:29:55.953
WHICH IS IT WAS A IT WAS A

02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:58.856
NOTICE TO BEGAN TO THE C. P. ONE

02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:01.225
CONTRACTOR BUT WITH MAJOR

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:03.260
LIMITATIONS SO WE COULD HIGH.

02:30:03.327 --> 02:30:03.761
TRY.

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:05.296
TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND AT THE

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:07.832
SAME TIME REDUCE WHAT THE

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:10.234
EXPOSURE WAS GONNA BE --

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:11.969
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THAT.

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:13.437
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOT

02:30:13.504 --> 02:30:14.839
THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.507
IN WITH THAT MONEY IT IS BEEN

02:30:16.574 --> 02:30:17.808
BUILDING ASSETS.

02:30:17.875 --> 02:30:21.178
OF THAT THREE AND A HALF MILLION

02:30:21.245 --> 02:30:21.779
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN ROUND

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.948
NUMBERS HAS BEEN LOST TO THE

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:24.915
DELAY.

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:26.617
I STILL THINK THAT THE STATE OF

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:28.452
CALIFORNIA IS THE BENEFICIARY OF

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:30.121
ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

02:30:30.187 --> 02:30:31.989
OF ASSETS THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:35.393
BEFORE AND ABSENT THAT --

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:36.994
WE WOULD PROBABLY BE SITTING

02:30:37.061 --> 02:30:38.696
HERE IF WE WERE EVEN SITTING

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:39.730
HERE TODAY AT ALL.

02:30:39.797 --> 02:30:41.799
BEING QUESTION IS WHY HAVEN'T WE

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:45.102
A COP RE NEVER ABLE TO BUILD

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.537
ANYTHING.

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:47.505
KING ALL THOSE THINGS INTO

02:30:47.571 --> 02:30:49.540
ACCOUNT WE HAD A LOT A LOT OF

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:51.742
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE COST

02:30:51.809 --> 02:30:54.011
OF CONSTRUCTION WERE IN THE C.

02:30:54.078 --> 02:30:54.812
P.'S.

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:55.746
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:30:55.813 --> 02:30:57.448
INFORMATION ON THE AREAS THAT I

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:58.983
TOLD YOU ABOUT.

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:00.684
AND WE WERE ALSO TAKING

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.286
ADVANTAGE OF SOMETHING ELSE WE

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:03.654
WERE IN A MASSIVE RECESSION.

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:05.556
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:06.857
MOVING FORWARD.

02:31:06.924 --> 02:31:08.626
WE WERE THE BENEFICIARY OF LOWER

02:31:08.692 --> 02:31:10.261
CONSTRUCTION COST WHEN WE WENT

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:12.496
AHEAD AND MOVE FORWARD ON CP.

02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:14.365
ONE THAT CP ONE CONTRACT CAME

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:16.100
AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION

02:31:16.167 --> 02:31:18.702
DOLLARS LESS THAN ARE AND SHE

02:31:18.769 --> 02:31:21.939
ENGINEERS ESTIMATE.

DIDN'T MAKE IT --

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:37.421
UNION PACIFIC STANDARDS SO THE

THAT THE STORY WAS TOLD THAT THE

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:44.128
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR SHOULD

BEAR THE COST OF THE REDESIGN.

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:48.466
AND THE BEAT BECAUSE OF THE

02:31:48.532 --> 02:31:49.567
AUTHORITIES.

SUGGESTION ENERGY IN GENERAL

02:32:17.495 --> 02:32:18.295
SENSE.

02:32:18.362 --> 02:32:19.997
WE CERTAINLY DO HAVE --

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:23.067
A LOT OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS.

02:32:23.133 --> 02:32:27.605

THAT WE KNOW THAT MAY BE GOING

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:35.946
ON AND ON A SPECIFIC ISSUE.

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:37.448
IN THIS --

02:32:37.515 --> 02:32:39.083
ONE I SUSPECTED.

02:32:39.149 --> 02:32:40.518
THE ADVICE MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN

02:32:40.584 --> 02:32:42.887

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:48.158
OTHER SOURCES ABOUT THE SAME

02:32:48.225 --> 02:32:50.327
THING WE MAY NOT TAKE THE ADVICE

02:32:50.394 --> 02:32:51.829
OF THE CONSULTANT EVERY INSTANCE.

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:53.764
AND WHAT I THINK HAPPENS HERE

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:54.832
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED THROUGHOUT

02:32:54.899 --> 02:32:57.668
THIS WHICH IS REALLY --

02:32:57.735 --> 02:33:00.638
TROUBLING AND EMBARRASSING IS

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:03.607
THAT WE HAVE NOT APPROPRIATELY --

02:33:03.674 --> 02:33:05.876
RECORDED KEY AND DOCUMENTATION

02:33:05.943 --> 02:33:08.379
WHY WE'VE DONE THINGS AND I CAN

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:10.714
SIT HERE AND JUST TELL YOU IT'S

02:33:10.781 --> 02:33:11.982
ON INEXCUSABLE.

02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:13.617
AND I AM FRANKLY OF EMBARRASSED

02:33:13.684 --> 02:33:15.319
ABOUT IT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT

02:33:15.386 --> 02:33:18.622
WE HAVE EVER INTENDED --

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:20.724
IN OUR FINANCE AND AUDIT --

02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:22.826
MEETINGS WHICH OCCUR MONTHLY AND

02:33:22.893 --> 02:33:24.929
I SUSPECT I I AM SURE I

02:33:24.995 --> 02:33:26.397

02:33:27.798 --> 02:33:29.099
MADE A HABIT OF COMING TO THOSE

02:33:29.166 --> 02:33:31.435
BUT I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:32.770
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPORT BACK.

02:33:32.836 --> 02:33:34.572
THOSE ARE PRETTY --

02:33:34.638 --> 02:33:36.240
THOSE ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT UP

02:33:36.307 --> 02:33:37.775
STERN MEETINGS.

02:33:37.841 --> 02:33:40.110
AND LOOKING.

02:33:40.177 --> 02:33:43.414
FOR LOOKING FOR THEY WERE NOT

SATISFIED WITH.

02:33:45.282 --> 02:33:46.216

THAT'S TRUE THAT'S A GOOD

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:59.096
QUESTION I THINK THAT --

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:01.632
I THINK WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM.

02:34:01.699 --> 02:34:05.269

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:11.842
WOULD CONCUR --

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:14.311
WE WERE MORE THAN FORTUNATE TO

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:15.813
HAVE BRIAN KELLY JOINED.

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:20.484
AS A CEO OF THIS ORGANIZATION.

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:21.785
JOE HEDGES JUST COME --

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:23.354
WITH A VERY IN DEPTH

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:25.055
CONSTRUCTION BACKGROUND AND A

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:26.991
HUGE PROBLEM ON A PROJECT THAT

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:27.958
HE WAS.

02:34:28.025 --> 02:34:30.227
RESPONSIBLE FOR UP IN SEATTLE A

02:34:30.294 --> 02:34:32.162
TUNNEL PROJECT.

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:35.633
GOING DOWN BILL THAT THAT LEVEL --

02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:37.635
I BELIEVE THAT OUR SENIOR

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.136
MANAGEMENT --

02:34:39.203 --> 02:34:40.804
I'M PROUD OF EVERYONE OF THEM.

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.506
TO BREAK DOWN THAT WE HAVE I

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:44.808
THINK IS NOT IN PEOPLE NOT

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:46.310
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:49.346
I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S AND AS

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:51.482
DEMONSTRATED BY THIS AUDIT.

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:53.550
IT'S MORE IN DAMAGE IT'S IT'S

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:54.051
YEAH IN.

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:55.686
THE DOCUMENTATION NOT BEING

02:34:55.753 --> 02:34:59.123
THERE TO THE PROBLEMS ARE.

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:00.524
WHICH IS WHY THIS WHOLE THING

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:03.027
WITH REGARDS TO CONTRACT MANAGE --

02:35:03.093 --> 02:35:05.529
CAN'T CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CAME

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:14.171
THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE DIDN'T

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:15.039
LIKE THE RESULTS.

02:35:15.105 --> 02:35:17.574
SO WE THEN HAD THE INTERNAL

02:35:17.641 --> 02:35:18.942
AUDIT OFFICE.

WHICH OCCURRED LE IN TWO

02:35:31.922 --> 02:35:32.423
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AS I

THAT PRETTY MUCH.

02:35:55.212 --> 02:35:56.080
ALL UP AND DOWN BASED UPON THE

02:35:56.146 --> 02:35:59.650

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:01.318
WE'VE GOT TO IMPROVE.

02:36:01.385 --> 02:36:03.287
DRAMATICALLY THE INFORMATION

02:36:03.353 --> 02:36:04.354

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:06.090
STAFF MEMBERS KNOW AND THE ONLY

02:36:06.156 --> 02:36:07.825
WAY I KNOW TO DO THAT IS TO

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.892
LIKE THAT AND FINANCE AND AUDIT

02:36:41.959 --> 02:36:43.694
AND WE GIVE DIRECTION FOR

02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:45.529
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

02:36:45.596 --> 02:36:47.064
SO HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO FIX

02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:48.232
THIS -- THIS

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:52.536
DISCONNECT.

02:36:52.603 --> 02:36:54.471
AND IS IT SOMETHING MONEY WITH

02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:55.639
YOUR AND BASICALLY IT'S THE

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:57.875
INTERFACE WITH YOU.

02:36:57.941 --> 02:37:00.511
AS A DIRECTOR WAS STAFF.

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:02.179
LIGHTING UP YEAH COME ON AND

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:02.880
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S.

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:04.148
I I THINK THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:37:04.214 --> 02:37:05.082
ALREADY MOVED IN THAT I THINK

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:05.749
WHICH I THOUGHT WHAT'S HAPPENED

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:07.284
HERE.

02:37:07.351 --> 02:37:08.986
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING IF.

02:37:09.052 --> 02:37:12.422
WE WERE DOING THIS SHOT A YEAR

02:37:12.489 --> 02:37:13.290
FROM NOW.

02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:14.258
AND AND THAT'S NOT A COP OUT

02:37:14.324 --> 02:37:14.558
[inaudible]

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:18.028
BUT PRETTY EVERYTHING THAT I

02:37:18.095 --> 02:37:19.830
HAVE SEEN IN CORPORATE IT IN THE

02:37:19.897 --> 02:37:21.832
AUDIT.

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:22.933
AND ALL OF WHICH I AGREE.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.068
ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LOOK AT

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:26.537
INTO SOME GREAT EXTENT

02:37:26.603 --> 02:37:28.872
INTERNALLY WITH OUR OWN INTERNAL

02:37:28.939 --> 02:37:29.706
AUDIT AND THROUGH FINANCE AND

02:37:29.773 --> 02:37:31.175
AUDIT -- AND

02:37:31.241 --> 02:37:32.676
THESE WERE ALL IN THE PROCESS OF

02:37:32.743 --> 02:37:34.411
BEING IMPLEMENTED IF THERE'S ONE

02:37:34.478 --> 02:37:35.179
THING I'VE BEEN REALLY

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:37.347
DISAPPOINTED BY IS THAT BECAUSE

02:37:37.414 --> 02:37:40.217
WE THAT WE WE HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW.

02:37:40.284 --> 02:37:42.886
ON THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR CONTRACT

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.455

02:37:46.557 --> 02:37:47.424
FOUND OUT.

02:37:47.491 --> 02:37:49.560
AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH REGARDS

02:37:49.626 --> 02:37:50.327
TO THAT.

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:52.262
THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF WHAT

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:54.031

02:38:03.674 --> 02:38:04.741
NOT KNOW THAT --

02:38:04.808 --> 02:38:06.677
IN HAND FRANKLY.

02:38:06.743 --> 02:38:07.778

02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:29.092
BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS THROUGH

02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:31.995
THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND --

02:39:32.062 --> 02:39:34.531
CANDIDATES FOR THESE POSITIONS

02:39:34.598 --> 02:39:36.433

BE WILLING TO WORK AND RUN A

02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:44.207
PROJECT LIKE THIS FOR THE AMOUNT

02:39:44.274 --> 02:39:45.208
OF THERE BEING COMPENSATED.

02:39:45.275 --> 02:39:46.610
BECAUSE AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:39:46.677 --> 02:39:48.111
PRIVATE SECTOR WHEN YOU GET

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:50.314
BELOW THAT LEVEL --

02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:53.016
I DON'T THINK THE CHALLENGES AND

02:39:53.083 --> 02:39:54.451
I DON'T I I MUST TELL YOU I'M

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:56.219
NOT QUITE SURE.

02:39:56.286 --> 02:39:58.488
WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS WHY IF

02:39:58.555 --> 02:39:59.823
YOU'VE GOT TWO HUNDRED AND?

02:39:59.890 --> 02:40:01.325
FOURTEEN PHYSICIANS WHY YOU

02:40:01.391 --> 02:40:06.196
DON'T HAVE ALL TWO HUNDRED AND

02:40:06.263 --> 02:40:07.364
FOURTEEN FILLED AND YOU PROBABLY

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.398
KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO I

02:40:08.465 --> 02:40:09.466
DON'T BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:11.601
ENDEMIC IN THE STATE.

02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:13.537
WELL I JUST.

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:14.705
YOU I KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU

02:40:14.771 --> 02:40:15.305
BROUGHT BRIAN KELLY OVER HIS

02:40:15.372 --> 02:40:17.307
PAYS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN

02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:18.241
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:40:18.308 --> 02:40:19.309
SO I'M WONDERING HOW WHY WOULD

02:40:19.376 --> 02:40:20.677
BE A PROBLEM TO PAY CONSTRUCTION

02:40:20.744 --> 02:40:22.079
MANAGERS WHO ARE BOOTS ON THE

02:40:22.145 --> 02:40:26.316
GROUND IN THE FIELD DOING THE

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:28.552
WORK BASICALLY I THINK --

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:30.654
THAT IT BY AND LARGE THEY ARE.

02:40:30.721 --> 02:40:33.357
UNLESS THEY ARE APPOINTEES OF BY

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:35.525
THE GOVERNOR I THINK THEY AND

02:40:35.592 --> 02:40:37.260
THEIR COMPENSATION IS SUBJECT TO

02:40:37.327 --> 02:40:38.962
THE PAYMENT SCALE OF STATE IN

02:40:39.029 --> 02:40:40.197
PLACE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:40:40.263 --> 02:40:41.465
EMPLOYERS.

02:40:41.531 --> 02:40:42.766
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A THAT IF

02:40:42.833 --> 02:40:44.968
IT IS AND HAS BEEN A HELPER.

02:40:45.035 --> 02:40:48.472
TO OF OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:51.041
TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION PROJECT

02:40:51.108 --> 02:40:52.809
ADDRESSED AND IT MIGHT HAVE TO

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:54.244
BE ADDRESSED THROUGH.

02:40:54.311 --> 02:40:56.179
LEGISLATION THAT TO WORK TOWARDS

02:40:56.246 --> 02:40:58.315
SOMEBODY THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE

02:40:58.382 --> 02:40:59.983
THE WATCHDOG FOR THE PEOPLE.

02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:01.718
LIKE HEY I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA

02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:03.653
THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU COULD

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:04.521
DO ONE OTHER THING AT THE SAME

02:41:04.588 --> 02:41:05.822
TIME.

02:41:05.889 --> 02:41:08.492
WOULD BE DEFINED USE --

02:41:08.558 --> 02:41:09.559
TO HEALTH CLASS --

02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:10.594
BREAK THROUGH THE CAP THAT WE'VE

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:11.862
GOT THAT WE CAN PAY FOR

02:41:11.928 --> 02:41:13.597
ADMINISTRATION WELL IN AGAIN

02:41:13.663 --> 02:41:15.465
I'VE BEGGED TO BE A PARTNER FOR

02:41:15.532 --> 02:41:16.700
THE AUTHORITY FOR YEARS.

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:18.001
BUT I ONLY GET TRICKLES OF

02:41:18.068 --> 02:41:19.870
INFORMATION.

02:41:19.936 --> 02:41:20.470
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU AND

02:41:20.537 --> 02:41:22.005
I'VE EVER MET ME AND I'VE BEEN

02:41:22.906 --> 02:41:23.306
YEARS.

02:41:23.373 --> 02:41:24.775
AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED

02:41:24.841 --> 02:41:26.843
TO DO IS BETTER PARTNER WITH THE

02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:29.513
LEGISLATURE NOT CREATE THIS WALL

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:31.114
OF SECRECY.

GET INFORMATION.

02:41:35.052 --> 02:41:37.387
INJUST DRIBBLES AND I THINK

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:38.722
THAT HAS TO STOP ALSO I THINK

02:41:38.789 --> 02:41:40.924

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:38.475
SAY THIS THE AUDITOR HASN'T HAD

02:43:38.542 --> 02:43:40.443
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN LOOK AT

02:43:40.510 --> 02:43:43.246
ANYTHING THAT I'M JUST SAYING SO

02:43:43.313 --> 02:43:43.613
IT'S NOT THAT --

02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:44.347
AND THAT.

02:43:44.414 --> 02:43:46.816
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE

02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:48.251
AUDITOR WOULD AGREE OR DISAGREE

02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:50.554
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE LOOK AT

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:53.323
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

02:43:53.390 --> 02:43:55.091
THAT.

02:43:55.158 --> 02:43:56.393
THIS START NUMBER THAT THE

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:59.095
AUDITOR USED DID NOT INCLUDE

02:43:59.162 --> 02:43:59.563
SOME.

02:43:59.629 --> 02:44:01.631
THINGS IN ADDITION TO WHAT

02:44:01.698 --> 02:44:04.367
ACTUALLY IS THE THE CP CONTRACTS

02:44:04.434 --> 02:44:08.405
WE'VE GOT CP ONE TWO THREE AND

02:44:08.471 --> 02:44:09.539
FOUR THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WAS

02:44:09.606 --> 02:44:11.474
USED WELL IN ADDITION TO THOSE

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:12.676
FROM THE VERY OUTSET OF THE

02:44:12.742 --> 02:44:14.044
PROJECT.

02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:16.246
WE HAD OTHER COST WHICH INCLUDED

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:18.181
PROVISIONAL SOUNDS AND

02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:19.316
CONTINGENCY.

02:44:19.382 --> 02:44:22.452
WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE WE CAUGHT

02:44:22.519 --> 02:44:24.187
AS AS YOU MAY KNOW BECAUSE OF

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:27.424
YOU AND I BOTH BEING FROM FRESNO

02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:29.993
NINE WAS RELOCATED --

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:31.595
BETWEEN OUT BY GOLDEN STATE

02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.530
COMING COMING SOUTH THAT

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:34.831
RELOCATION WE DIDN'T DO THE WORK

02:44:34.898 --> 02:44:36.766
BUT IT'S PART OF OUR PROJECT WE

02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:38.201
CONTRACTED WITH CALTRANS.

02:44:38.268 --> 02:44:41.538
THAT'S A NUMBER THAT IS IT AS WE

02:44:41.605 --> 02:44:43.273
WOULD LOOK AT IT WE WOULD IN

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.275
HAVE INCORPORATED THAT THE NORM

02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:47.344
NORM NORTHERN EXTENSION THE

02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:49.012
THREE MILES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT --

02:44:49.079 --> 02:44:53.483
IN IN THE IN MY S. STATEMENT --

02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:55.852
WE INCORPORATE THAT --

02:44:55.919 --> 02:44:57.320
AND WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T HEARD

02:44:57.387 --> 02:44:59.055
AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE A CHANGE

02:44:59.122 --> 02:45:00.657
ORDER THERE.

02:45:00.724 --> 02:45:02.359
BUT WHAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TAKE

02:45:02.425 --> 02:45:03.526
THAT INTO ACCOUNT AT THE START

02:45:03.593 --> 02:45:06.329
POINT.

02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:08.265
WHAT WE HAVE IS?

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:12.502
THE AS WE SEE IT THE FUTURE WORK --

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:14.437
THAT THE I THINK THE AUDITOR IS

02:45:14.504 --> 02:45:16.106
TALKING ABOUT WE'RE SEEING THAT

02:45:16.172 --> 02:45:18.308
IS IT AS ABOUT NOT A ONE POINT

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:19.509
SIX BILLION DOLLARS REACHING

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:21.211
THAT IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND

02:45:21.278 --> 02:45:22.512
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:45:22.579 --> 02:45:24.281
BECAUSE THESE OTHER COSTS HAVE

02:45:24.347 --> 02:45:26.549
TO BE CAPTURED FROM THE BACK

02:45:26.616 --> 02:45:28.151
BEFORE THAT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T.

02:45:28.218 --> 02:45:29.886
OVER RUNS THEY WERE COSTS THAT

02:45:29.953 --> 02:45:31.855
AREN'T CAPTURED AT THE OUTSET

02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:33.990
AND WE DID HAVE THOSE CAPTURED

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:37.494
IN OURS.

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:39.129
OKAY BUT AGAIN I HER TESTIMONY

02:45:39.195 --> 02:45:41.064
THAT YOU CAN COOPER.

02:45:41.131 --> 02:45:43.166
WITH THE AUDIT BUT I GUESS

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:43.967
TIGHTLY CHIRLA CONCURRENT WITH

02:45:44.034 --> 02:45:45.602
THE ON I CONCUR WITH THE TOTAL

02:45:45.669 --> 02:45:47.237
COST IS A MATTER OF HOW YOU

02:45:47.304 --> 02:45:48.104
CLASSIFY THE CAR OKAY LET'S

02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:50.373
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE DEADLINE

02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:53.843
ISSUE AND THE THE CLAWBACK ISSUE --

02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:55.612
I REALLY THINK THIS IS THE THIS

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:57.347
IS THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP YOU YOU

02:45:57.414 --> 02:45:59.883
ARE FACING AN AUDIT.

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:00.784
A BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

02:46:00.850 --> 02:46:03.219
THAT.

02:46:03.286 --> 02:46:04.954
FEDERAL ON IT --

02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:07.891
BEGAN IN APRIL --

02:46:07.957 --> 02:46:09.893
WE THINK THAT IT IS PROCEEDING

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:12.162
AND WE MAY HAVE SOME RESULTS IN

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:14.497
SEVERAL MONTHS THERE ARE.

02:46:14.564 --> 02:46:17.400
HEY EXPLICIT IN THE AUDIT.

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:22.105
REAL CONCERNS ABOUT NUMBER --

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:23.139
ONE THE EARLY USE OF THE FEDERAL

02:46:23.206 --> 02:46:23.840
MONEY.

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:25.275
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SIR IT

02:46:25.342 --> 02:46:27.110
SOUNDED LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE

02:46:27.177 --> 02:46:28.478
WAS PREPARED BY A LAWYER

02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:29.779
ANTICIPATING THE FEDS GOING OVER

02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:31.848
YOUR SHOULDER.

02:46:31.915 --> 02:46:34.417
THANK YOU BUT IT WAS.

02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:36.586
WELL THEN YOU CREATED MAYBE HAVE

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:37.787
A LAWYER IS NOT.

02:46:37.854 --> 02:46:39.222
WHAT I HEARD WHAT I HEARD AND

02:46:39.289 --> 02:46:40.190
THAT?

02:46:40.256 --> 02:46:42.092
WAS A DEFENSE.

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:45.061
OF WHAT OUR AUDITOR HAS

02:46:45.128 --> 02:46:46.096
CONCLUDED IS NOT DEFENSIBLE.

02:46:46.162 --> 02:46:47.964
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME SOME

02:46:48.031 --> 02:46:49.799
ISSUES WITH THIS AND THAT BUT

02:46:49.866 --> 02:46:50.967
THAT'S JUST PART OF IT.

02:46:51.034 --> 02:46:52.969
BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM HERE.

02:46:53.036 --> 02:46:54.904
WITH THE WITH THE CLUB ACT ISN'T

02:46:54.971 --> 02:46:56.373
MISSING THIS DEADLINE --

02:46:56.439 --> 02:47:01.111
AND SO THE THE THE THE AND WHAT

02:47:01.177 --> 02:47:02.512
THE AUDITOR AT THE END OF THIS

02:47:02.579 --> 02:47:02.812
[inaudible]

02:47:02.879 --> 02:47:04.714
RECOMMENDED WITHIN.

DAUGHTER USED THE TERM

02:47:06.015 --> 02:47:07.050
CONTINGENCY PLAN.

02:47:07.117 --> 02:47:09.285
I'M USING THE TERM [inaudible]

02:47:09.352 --> 02:47:11.721
PLAN B..

02:47:11.788 --> 02:47:15.859
MR RICHEST PLAN A IS FAILING.

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:18.461
YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE THREE

02:47:18.528 --> 02:47:19.863
DIFFERENT SEGMENTS.

02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:21.231
AND WE'RE LEFT IN CENTRAL

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:22.766
CALIFORNIA WITH THE RAIL ROAD

02:47:22.832 --> 02:47:24.901
THAT GOES FROM OUTSIDE MADERA

02:47:24.968 --> 02:47:27.303

THAT CLAWBACK.

02:47:36.646 --> 02:47:39.082
COULD BE THE TWO THREE BILLION

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:41.618
DOLLARS THAT YOU STATE WE SO

02:47:41.684 --> 02:47:43.153
FORTUITOUS LEAST.

02:47:43.219 --> 02:47:45.288

OR OTHERS IN YOUR AUTHORITY

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.034
LEADERSHIP --

02:47:58.101 --> 02:48:02.305
AND IF I ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:05.208
CONFIDENCE WITH THE AUDITOR'S

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:07.243
I'M ASKING YOU CONFIDENCE.

02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:08.978
ARE WE GOING TO END UP HAVING TO

GIVE BACK THREE BILLION DOLLARS

02:48:11.047 --> 02:48:12.715
TO THE FEDS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:48:12.782 --> 02:48:14.751
POTENTIAL HERE.

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:16.986
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S IT'S

NOT IT'S DECEMBER BUT IT'S SHE

02:48:18.087 --> 02:48:19.322
THERE'S SOME SOME SIMILARITIES

02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:20.390
WE HAD.

02:48:20.457 --> 02:48:21.891
WE HAD THE SAME ISSUE OR A A

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:23.693
KIND SIMILAR ISSUE AND SPENDING

02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:25.862
THE MONEY HAD WE NOT SPENT IT BY

02:48:25.929 --> 02:48:27.864
SEPTEMBER SEVENTEEN WHATEVER WE

02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:29.032
HAD SPENT.

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:30.733
WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MADE IT

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.535
WOULD NO LONGER BEEN MADE

02:48:32.602 --> 02:48:35.238
AVAILABLE TO US.

02:48:35.305 --> 02:48:38.341
WE THOUGHT BUT SERRANO I GUESS

02:48:38.408 --> 02:48:39.108
I'M THAT.

02:48:39.175 --> 02:48:40.410
OR USE IT AND YOU KNEW GOING IN

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:41.044
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IT AND YOU

02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:44.747
MADE A CALCULATED DECISION. TO

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:46.316
DO WHAT YOU DID IT BACK WITHOUT

02:48:46.382 --> 02:48:47.217
REPORTING IT TO US WITH WE WE

02:48:47.283 --> 02:48:48.117
HAD TO FIND THIS OUT MISTER

02:48:48.184 --> 02:48:49.452
KELLY HAD TO COME IN AND SAY WE

02:48:49.519 --> 02:48:51.020
MADE THIS TERRIBLE MISTAKE WE'RE

02:48:51.087 --> 02:48:53.156
NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

02:48:53.223 --> 02:48:54.591
SIR IT'S NOT ABOUT YESTERDAY

02:48:54.657 --> 02:48:56.793
THIS IS ABOUT TOMORROW AND THIS

02:48:56.860 --> 02:48:57.360
AUDIT.

02:48:57.427 --> 02:48:59.162
IS COMING AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:01.931
TO DEAL WITH IT I'M ASKING WHAT

02:49:01.998 --> 02:49:04.000
IS YOUR PLAN B. AND IT'S

02:49:04.067 --> 02:49:06.903
REASONABLE TO ASK --

02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:07.470
I THINK GIVEN WHERE WE ARE.

02:49:07.537 --> 02:49:09.572
IT HOW ARE YOU WHAT CONFIDENCE

02:49:09.639 --> 02:49:11.007
DO YOU HAVE IN MEETING.

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:13.142
THE TIMELINE AND IN DEFENDING

02:49:13.209 --> 02:49:15.044
YOUR USE OF THE MONEY.

02:49:15.111 --> 02:49:16.179
I THINK THE ALL THOSE ARE FAIR

02:49:16.246 --> 02:49:18.014
QUESTIONS I WAS JUST I WAS JUST

02:49:18.081 --> 02:49:19.482
GIVING.

02:49:19.549 --> 02:49:21.017
A SIMILARITY.

02:49:21.084 --> 02:49:22.819
IN WHAT WE HAD TO DO TO MEET THE

02:49:22.886 --> 02:49:24.554
SEVENTEEN DEADLINE WITH REGARDS

02:49:24.621 --> 02:49:26.289
TO GOING FORWARD.

02:49:26.356 --> 02:49:27.724
FIRST OF ALL I I THINK EVERYBODY

02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:29.692
WOULD UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING.

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:32.295
WE STARTED CONSTRUCTION AND

02:49:32.362 --> 02:49:33.496
THIRTEEN BUT WE WHAT WE LOST

02:49:33.563 --> 02:49:35.031
OVER A YEAR.

02:49:35.098 --> 02:49:37.667
BECAUSE OF OF LITIGATION.

02:49:37.734 --> 02:49:40.169
WE ALSO HAVE HAD DELAYS BECAUSE

02:49:40.236 --> 02:49:42.639
OF RIGHT OF WAY.

02:49:42.705 --> 02:49:43.540
AND WE'RE TAKING FULL

02:49:43.606 --> 02:49:46.042
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE THINGS

02:49:46.109 --> 02:49:47.844
SO WHILE WE MAY HAVE BEEN UNDER

02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:49.112
CONSTRUCTION IN.

02:49:49.178 --> 02:49:51.481
THEORETICALLY HAVING EXECUTED

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:53.082
CONTRACTS.

02:49:53.149 --> 02:49:55.084
THE CONSTRUCTION IS RAMPING HAS

02:49:55.151 --> 02:49:56.553
BEEN RAMPING UP.

02:49:56.619 --> 02:49:58.454
NOT SINCE THIRTEEN BUT REALLY IT

02:49:58.521 --> 02:49:59.989
IS SINCE WE WERE ABLE TO START

02:50:00.056 --> 02:50:03.092
BUILDING SO AS WE AS WE HAVE NOW

02:50:03.159 --> 02:50:06.663
WE'VE GOT 77% OF THE RIGHT AWAY.

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:07.196
FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND SOME

02:50:07.263 --> 02:50:09.599
PARTIALS OUT OF THE EIGHT NEED

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:11.634
FOR THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES.

02:50:11.701 --> 02:50:13.236
WHAT WE'VE DONE AS YOU POINTED

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.871
OUT EARLIER TO MISTER PATTERSON

02:50:14.938 --> 02:50:16.739
WITH I THINK YOU DID WITH SOME

02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:17.707
CONSTRUCTION HERE AND SOME

02:50:17.774 --> 02:50:19.275
CONSTRUCTION THEIR AND NOTHING

02:50:19.342 --> 02:50:20.176
IN BETWEEN?

02:50:20.243 --> 02:50:22.312
THAT THAT WAS BY DESIGN BECAUSE

02:50:22.378 --> 02:50:23.580
THOSE PARCELS THAT WE'RE

02:50:23.646 --> 02:50:25.648
BUILDING ON WERE CALLED PRIORITY

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:27.317
PARCELS BECAUSE THOSE ARE IN THE

02:50:27.383 --> 02:50:29.285
AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST

02:50:29.352 --> 02:50:30.753
COMPLEX CONSTRUCTION.

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.956
TAKES THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:35.124
DESTRUCT INSTRUCTION IT IS JUST

02:50:35.191 --> 02:50:35.892
ON THE GROUND.

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:36.693
THAT IS --

02:50:36.759 --> 02:50:38.661
EARTH WORK FOR IN A LOT OF WASTE

02:50:38.728 --> 02:50:40.997
AND PUTTING RAIL ON TOP OF THAT

02:50:41.064 --> 02:50:43.199
IS REGION IS NOT REALLY COMPLEX

02:50:43.266 --> 02:50:43.466
DISCUSS.

02:50:43.533 --> 02:50:45.234
CONSTRUCTION BUT IF WE HAD ALL

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.770
OF THAT BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.739
THESE LARGE STRUCTURES WE WOULD

02:50:49.806 --> 02:50:51.174
HAVE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE

02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:53.142
SITTING THERE SO WE MADE A

02:50:53.209 --> 02:50:54.477
CONSCIOUS DECISION --

02:50:54.544 --> 02:50:55.778
THAT WE NEEDED TO GET THE

02:50:55.845 --> 02:51:00.350
CRITICAL PARCELS DONE FIRST.

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:01.818
WHEN WITH SO I IT HAPPENS I HAVE

02:51:01.884 --> 02:51:02.518
A BELIEF?

02:51:02.585 --> 02:51:04.120
AND I THINK A REALISTIC ONE THAT

02:51:04.187 --> 02:51:04.954
YOU WILL SEE AND IT'S ALREADY

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:06.689
BEEN OCCURRING THAT OUR RATE OF

02:51:06.756 --> 02:51:09.892
CONSTRUCTION SPEND IS INCREASING.

02:51:09.959 --> 02:51:12.328
WHAT WE WILL DO BY NEXT MARCH IS

02:51:12.395 --> 02:51:15.431
WE WILL HAVE YOUR PLAN BE IT

02:51:15.498 --> 02:51:17.266
WE'RE WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW?

02:51:17.333 --> 02:51:19.936
AND WHAT PLANNED BE WILL MEET

02:51:20.003 --> 02:51:21.337
ONE OF THEM ONE ALTERNATIVE WITH

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:23.072
TIME THE IS LIKELY GOING TO BE

02:51:23.139 --> 02:51:24.173
ISSUE WOULD GAS.

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.808
GOING TO OUR FEDERAL --

02:51:25.875 --> 02:51:27.343
PARTNER THE FEDERAL --

02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:29.879
RAIL ADMINISTRATION AND TALK

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:30.980
ABOUT AN EXTENSION.

02:51:31.047 --> 02:51:33.082
I DON'T THINK TODAY AS I'M

02:51:33.149 --> 02:51:34.183
SITTING HERE THAT I THINK IT

02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:35.485
EXTENSION IS GOING TO BE

02:51:35.551 --> 02:51:36.619
NECESSARY.

02:51:36.686 --> 02:51:37.954
BUT I WANT TO PLAN FOR OR THEY

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:41.658
THOUGHT OR WHAT IF IT BECOMES

02:51:41.724 --> 02:51:43.359
NECESSARY WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT

02:51:43.426 --> 02:51:45.762
AND WAIT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:51:45.828 --> 02:51:46.362
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:51.701
IT -- SO

02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:53.236
TUNNELING THROUGH THE SAN

02:51:53.302 --> 02:51:54.470
GABRIEL MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH

02:51:54.537 --> 02:51:56.606
PACHECO PASS IS NOT COMPLICATED

02:51:56.673 --> 02:51:58.474
EXPENSIVE AND COULD BLOW THIS

02:51:58.541 --> 02:52:00.143
WHOLE THING UP I MEAN HONESTLY.

02:52:00.209 --> 02:52:01.544
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE BUILDING ON

02:52:01.611 --> 02:52:02.945
TWO ENDS IT THERE'S NO

02:52:03.012 --> 02:52:04.847
CONNECTIVITY THAT I CAN SEE THAT

02:52:04.914 --> 02:52:06.282
YOU CAN POSSIBLY.

02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:08.184
PUT UP.

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:10.286
MONEY INTO AT THAT AND HAVE IT.

02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:12.689
HAVE IT BE DONE AND SO I I STILL

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:15.158
COME BACK WHEN I SAY PLAN B..

02:52:15.224 --> 02:52:16.926
WHAT IS PLAN B. WHEN YOU CAN'T

02:52:16.993 --> 02:52:18.294
COMPLETE?

02:52:18.361 --> 02:52:20.096
THE SEGMENTS WHAT WHAT PLAN B.

02:52:20.163 --> 02:52:23.499
IS IS HOW DO WE ENSURE.

02:52:23.566 --> 02:52:24.734
THAT WE HAVE SPENT THE MONEY AND

02:52:24.801 --> 02:52:26.335
COMPLETED AND WE SPENT A SPENT

02:52:26.402 --> 02:52:28.337
THE MONEY AND COMPLETED THE WORK

02:52:28.404 --> 02:52:31.240
FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES.

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:32.842
BY.

02:52:32.909 --> 02:52:33.743
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S NOT

02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:34.677
DRILLING THROUGH ANY ANY THE

02:52:34.744 --> 02:52:35.878
CHECK A PASTOR ANY OF THOSE

02:52:35.945 --> 02:52:37.280
THINGS THAT'S NOT UNDER THAT

02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:39.248
THAT'S NOT UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

02:52:39.315 --> 02:52:40.550
WITH THIS MONEY THAT WE'VE GOT

02:52:40.616 --> 02:52:42.985
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO BUILD A

02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:45.188
HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILES WITH

02:52:45.254 --> 02:52:46.989
THE FUNDS OKAY DO YOU CONCUR

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:47.557
THAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:52:47.623 --> 02:52:48.758
MONEY TO COMPLETE.

02:52:48.825 --> 02:52:50.326
WITH THE ENTIRE PROJECT CAN YOU

02:52:50.393 --> 02:52:51.894
DON'T HAVE THE K. ONE WE NEVER

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.362
HAD THE ENTIRE MONEY TO COMPLETE

02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:56.899
FROM DAY.

02:52:56.966 --> 02:52:58.668
ONE IT'S NEVER CHANGED.

02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:00.336
TALK ABOUT AND AND ASK ABOUT

02:53:00.403 --> 02:53:02.071
THIS --

02:53:02.138 --> 02:53:04.574
SPEED TIME IN COMPETITIVE.

02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:06.309
FROM THAT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:06.909
FOOT LEVEL LOOK AT THE VALUE

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:07.977
PROPOSITION HERE.

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:09.445
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

02:53:09.512 --> 02:53:10.613
WAS WITHIN THE SPEED YOU BETWEEN

02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:12.915
LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO A

02:53:12.982 --> 02:53:13.683
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AN

02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:14.684
HOUR.

02:53:14.751 --> 02:53:15.885
AND YOU CAN YOU MAKE THE CLAIM

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:17.720
ON SPEED TIME AND

02:53:17.787 --> 02:53:19.122
COMPETITIVENESS IN OTHER WORDS

02:53:19.188 --> 02:53:19.956
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

02:53:20.022 --> 02:53:22.225
ALTERNATIVE TO FLYING AIRPLANES

02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:24.527
FROM LA. TO TO SAN FRANCISCO

02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:24.827
YOUR SPEED.

02:53:24.894 --> 02:53:27.930
IS GOING DOWN.

02:53:27.997 --> 02:53:31.234
YOUR TIME IS GOING UP.

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:32.502
I THINK THE COMPETITIVE

02:53:32.568 --> 02:53:33.336
ADVANTAGE IS GETTING A ROAD IT

02:53:33.402 --> 02:53:34.937
HERE.

02:53:35.004 --> 02:53:37.974
ARE YOU SIMILARLY CONCERNED

02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:39.976
ABOUT THE COMPETITIVENESS BEING

02:53:40.042 --> 02:53:42.812
A WROTE IT AND THE COMPETITIVE

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:44.981
VALUE.

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:46.215
OFTEN OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF

02:53:46.282 --> 02:53:48.384
TRANSPORTATION THAT ISN'T AS

02:53:48.451 --> 02:53:50.586
FAST AND TAKES MORE TIME --

02:53:50.653 --> 02:53:51.821
THEN WHAT YOU PROPOSED NO I'M

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:53.256
NOT.

02:53:53.322 --> 02:53:56.526
AND OUR SPEED.

02:53:56.592 --> 02:53:58.895
IS ALWAYS BEEN AT OR ABOVE TWO

02:53:58.961 --> 02:53:59.829
HUNDRED AT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:53:59.896 --> 02:54:00.863
TWENTY NINE ARE NOT AT OR ABOUT

02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:02.698
THE SPEED IS TWO HUNDRED AND

02:54:02.765 --> 02:54:03.900
TWENTY MILES AN HOUR IT WAS

02:54:03.966 --> 02:54:07.069
NEVER DESIGNED OR SIGN.

02:54:07.136 --> 02:54:08.738
THAT FOR THE ENTIRE DISTANCE

02:54:08.805 --> 02:54:10.106
YOU'D BE GOING TO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:11.340
MILES AN HOUR THAT WAS NEVER

02:54:11.407 --> 02:54:12.942
INTENDED AND WOULDN'T BE

02:54:13.009 --> 02:54:13.609
INTENDED.

02:54:13.676 --> 02:54:16.445
IN IN IN URBAN AREAS EVEN IN OUR

02:54:16.512 --> 02:54:18.748
CITY AND FRESNO THAT TRAIN IS

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:20.249
NOT GONNA COME FLYING THROUGH.

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:22.018
FRESNO IT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:54:22.084 --> 02:54:22.652
MILES AN HOUR IT'S GOING TO BE

02:54:22.718 --> 02:54:24.320
CLOSER TO SPEED IS ONE THING I

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:27.223
ALSO ASKED ABOUT TIME IF A BLACK

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:27.824
HEART.

02:54:27.890 --> 02:54:29.192
LOW DOWN BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DO

02:54:29.258 --> 02:54:30.226
YOUR TIME AND ROUTE IS GOING TO

02:54:30.293 --> 02:54:32.094
GO UP EVERY EVERY DESIGN

02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:33.629
DECISION WE'VE MADE FOR THE

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:34.864
EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN AT

02:54:34.931 --> 02:54:36.032
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:54:36.098 --> 02:54:38.234
IS WITH A ABSOLUTE FOCUS ON HOW

02:54:38.301 --> 02:54:39.202
MANY.

02:54:39.268 --> 02:54:41.237
HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS WE I

02:54:41.304 --> 02:54:44.740
THINK RIGHT NOW OR TWO HOURS.

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:45.842
THIRTY SIX MINUTES AND FORTY

02:54:45.908 --> 02:54:48.377
SECONDS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABOVE

02:54:48.444 --> 02:54:49.478
TO TO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES

02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:51.047
WHICH IS WHAT'S REQUIRED BY

02:54:51.113 --> 02:54:52.181
PROPOSITION ONE DAY.

02:54:52.248 --> 02:54:53.916
AND WE'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH BELOW

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:55.718
WHERE WE ARE NOW EVERY DECISION

02:54:55.785 --> 02:54:56.786
WE'VE NAY.

02:54:56.853 --> 02:54:58.821
AND ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK INTO

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:00.957
BLENDING IS CAN WE PLANNED AND

02:55:01.023 --> 02:55:03.392
SAVE THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS STATE

02:55:03.459 --> 02:55:04.327
MONEY.

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:05.828
AND STILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:08.064
OF PROPOSITION ONE A AND WE ARE

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:12.602
STILL TODAY ON TRACK TO DO THAT.

02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:14.170
SO YOU.

02:55:14.237 --> 02:55:15.404
ALTHOUGH SAYING YOU CONCUR WITH

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:16.639
THE AUDIT YOU ARE AGAIN SAYING

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:17.773
YOU DO NOT CONCUR WITH THE

02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:19.275
SERIOUS CONCERN RAISED BY OUR

02:55:19.342 --> 02:55:20.843
AUDITOR THAT THE COMPETITIVE

02:55:20.910 --> 02:55:22.812
ADVANTAGES BEING A ROAD IT.

02:55:22.879 --> 02:55:25.281
BY VIRTUE OF THE DECISIONS --

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:26.949
TO SPLIT BASICALLY SLOW IT DOWN.

02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:28.384
WELL WE'RE NOT THE THEIR THE

02:55:28.451 --> 02:55:30.786
TRAIN IS NOT SLOWING DOWN IT'S

02:55:30.853 --> 02:55:31.587
STILL AT WHAT WE VOIGTS.

02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:32.688
OF WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN

02:55:32.755 --> 02:55:34.824
OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE UNDER

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:37.260
PROPOSITION ONE A WITH REGARDS

02:55:37.326 --> 02:55:39.228
TO THE COMPETITION --

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:42.732
I KNOW FOR MYSELF EXPECT IT I

02:55:42.798 --> 02:55:43.566
MEAN.

02:55:43.633 --> 02:55:45.268
WE FOUGHT WE ALL GO TO AIRPORTS

02:55:45.334 --> 02:55:46.669
AND WE GET THERE AN HOUR AND A

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:48.204
HALF BEFORE WE NEED.

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:48.738
TO WE NEED TO GET ON THE

02:55:48.804 --> 02:55:49.805
AIRPLANE.

02:55:49.872 --> 02:55:51.140
AND THEN WE GOT A WONDER WAY OUT

02:55:51.207 --> 02:55:53.276
OF AN AIRLINE TERMINAL TO

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:55.544
WHEREVER WE'RE GOING --

02:55:55.611 --> 02:55:57.179
YOU HAVE AND YOU HAVE NONE OF

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.648
THAT GOING ON WITH HIGH SPEED

02:55:58.714 --> 02:56:00.116
RAIL AND YOU MAY DECIDE TO GO ON

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:01.450
AN AIRPLANE AND TAKE IT WHAT IS

02:56:01.517 --> 02:56:02.485
IT ABOUT AN HOUR AND THIRTY

02:56:02.551 --> 02:56:03.853
MINUTES TO GET TO LOS ANGELES

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.388
FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

02:56:05.454 --> 02:56:06.689

THEIR ADD ON ANOTHER HOUR AND A

02:56:10.559 --> 02:56:11.160
HALF.

02:56:11.227 --> 02:56:12.628
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE WALKED TO

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:15.932
THE A HIGH SPEED RAIL TERMINAL

02:56:15.998 --> 02:56:16.532
AND WALKED ON THE TRAIN AND GO

02:56:16.599 --> 02:56:18.301

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:19.869
THE ELAPSED AND I I I I I LOOK I

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:21.070
HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK IT'S A

02:56:21.137 --> 02:56:22.571
LOT OF SPECULATION.

02:56:22.638 --> 02:56:24.807

US HAVE HERE.

02:56:26.275 --> 02:56:27.543
THAT YESTERDAY'S MISTAKES ARE

02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:29.045
GOING TO BE CORRECTED SO THAT

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:31.514
TOMORROW IS NOT THE SAME OUTCOME.

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:33.449
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU I CONTINUE

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:35.351

02:56:35.418 --> 02:56:36.719
RESERVATIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU

COMPLETED PROJECT AND THE BIG

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:40.523
QUESTION FOR CENTRAL

CALIFORNIA'S WHAT YOU GONNA

02:56:42.258 --> 02:56:42.959
LEAVE BEHIND.

02:56:43.025 --> 02:56:45.294
A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES FROM

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:46.228
SOMEWHERE TO SOMEWHERE WHERE

02:56:46.295 --> 02:56:47.630
WEARING THAT TO ME IS THE BIG

02:56:47.697 --> 02:56:49.765
BIG PICTURE HERE THAT KEEPS ME

02:58:21.057 --> 02:58:22.725
THE LAST SENTENCE OF OF THE

02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:24.627
FIRST PAGE OF THE AUDIT SAYS

02:58:24.693 --> 02:58:25.661
DESPITE ITS CHALLENGING

02:58:25.728 --> 02:58:27.630
FINANCIAL SITUATION WE DETERMINE

02:58:27.696 --> 02:58:28.898
THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS FAILED TO

02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:29.965
IMPLEMENT SOUND CONTRACT

02:58:30.032 --> 02:58:31.600
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:32.101

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.346
TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY TWELVE

02:58:44.413 --> 02:58:44.814
DONE BY THE DOCTOR.

02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.949
THAT THEIR INTERNAL AUDITS DONE

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.384
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

02:58:48.451 --> 02:58:50.352
SIXTY WHAT GRADE DO YOU GIVE THE

02:58:50.419 --> 02:58:52.154

I WHICH I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.266
THAT.

02:59:04.333 --> 02:59:06.202
AS A RESULT OF AT LEAST VERY

02:59:06.268 --> 02:59:09.071
POOR DOCUMENTATION --

02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:12.108
IF I HAVE PUT A GREAT ON AND I

02:59:12.174 --> 02:59:13.576

02:59:13.642 --> 02:59:15.044
WOULD SAY IT'S BEING CORRECTED

02:59:15.111 --> 02:59:16.612
RIGHT NOW SO YOU DON'T GET A

02:59:16.679 --> 02:59:17.379
PASSING GRADE RIGHT NOW.

02:59:17.446 --> 02:59:19.715
I I I I THINK YOU'RE STILL IN

02:59:19.782 --> 02:59:21.550
CLASS.

02:59:21.617 --> 02:59:22.918

IN TERMS OF BEING THIS BEING A

02:59:28.691 --> 02:59:29.925
STRUCTURAL.

02:59:29.992 --> 02:59:32.461
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMATIC FAILURE IN

02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:33.929

02:59:33.996 --> 02:59:35.531
THAT ASSESSMENT.

02:59:35.598 --> 02:59:36.132
I WOULD SAY IT'S BEEN PRETTY

02:59:36.198 --> 02:59:39.335
CHALLENGING THAT IN THE PAST AND

02:59:39.401 --> 02:59:41.971
IT AS AS AS YOU MISTER PATTERSON

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:44.940
SAID WITHOUT WITHOUT.

02:59:45.007 --> 02:59:46.542
FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON THE PAST I

02:59:46.609 --> 02:59:47.676
AM VERY.

02:59:47.743 --> 02:59:50.779
CONFIDENT IN OUR CURRENT SENIOR

02:59:50.846 --> 02:59:52.715
LEADERSHIP FOR THIS PROGRAM --

02:59:52.781 --> 02:59:54.917
AND I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING

02:59:54.984 --> 02:59:55.951
TO ME.

02:59:56.018 --> 02:59:59.155
WITH THIS AUDIT AND I TELL YA I

02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:01.457
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I'M

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:03.192
HAPPY I'M HAPPY WE'VE GOT IT BUT

03:00:03.259 --> 03:00:04.727
WHAT I'M ALSO HAPPY ABOUT.

03:00:04.793 --> 03:00:07.296
IS IT'S IDENTIFYING NUMBERS OF

03:00:07.363 --> 03:00:07.863
THINGS THAT WE ALREADY KNEW

03:00:07.930 --> 03:00:10.566
ABOUT AND WE WERE IN THE PROCESS

03:00:10.633 --> 03:00:12.134
OF CHANGING AND I WOULD.

03:00:12.201 --> 03:00:13.369
YOU KNOW I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND

03:00:13.435 --> 03:00:16.772
ALL IT COULD BE SCHEDULED AGAIN

03:00:16.839 --> 03:00:18.274
BY THE STATE AUDITOR.

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:19.708
AND I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE

03:00:19.775 --> 03:00:22.645
MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE

03:00:22.711 --> 03:00:24.547
AREAS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED.

03:00:24.613 --> 03:00:26.415
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON

03:00:26.482 --> 03:00:28.551
THE PAST BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY

03:00:28.617 --> 03:00:29.385
PARTICULAR.

03:00:29.451 --> 03:00:31.687
RIGHT AND SO RIGHT NOW I HAVE

03:00:31.754 --> 03:00:35.024
[inaudible] FIVE AUDITS. FIVE

03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:36.859
ARE AT THAT OUTLINED THE SAME

03:00:36.926 --> 03:00:38.694
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURAL FAILURES.

03:00:38.761 --> 03:00:42.198
AND ANY AND ME FORTUNATE

03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:42.831
UNFORTUNATELY YEAR ON THE AUDIT

03:00:42.898 --> 03:00:43.599
COMMITTEE.

03:00:43.666 --> 03:00:45.968
SO YOU ARE ON THE THE PERSON

03:00:46.035 --> 03:00:47.836
THAT HAS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION --

03:00:47.903 --> 03:00:50.005
AND SO --

03:00:50.072 --> 03:00:51.941
FROM THAT STANDPOINT YOU KNOW.

03:00:52.007 --> 03:00:53.609
CALIFORNIANS ARE RIGHTFULLY

03:00:53.676 --> 03:00:55.110
UPSET.

03:00:55.177 --> 03:00:58.447
AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND CAN

03:00:58.514 --> 03:01:00.082
IF IT'S A SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURAL

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:01.317
PROBLEM.

03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:02.718
THEN THROWING MORE MONEY WHICH I

03:01:02.785 --> 03:01:05.321
MUST AND REMIND YOU IS NOT YOUR

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:06.722
MONEY IN IS NOT OUR MONEY.

03:01:06.789 --> 03:01:08.757
THE HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS OF

03:01:08.824 --> 03:01:09.858
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:01:09.925 --> 03:01:12.261
IN SO HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY AND

03:01:12.328 --> 03:01:14.230
DEFEND THROWING MORE MONEY INTO

03:01:14.296 --> 03:01:18.500
A SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING.

03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:19.535
WELL I DON'T THINK THE I THINK

03:01:19.602 --> 03:01:21.337
THAT I THINK THAT IN OUR

03:01:21.403 --> 03:01:23.639
MANAGEMENT OF OF SOME OF THE

03:01:23.706 --> 03:01:24.873
ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS TO

03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:26.008
THE SYSTEM.

03:01:26.075 --> 03:01:27.977
WE HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB FOR

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:29.478
THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF

03:01:29.545 --> 03:01:30.179
CALIFORNIA.

03:01:30.246 --> 03:01:31.447
AND FOR THE TAXPAYERS ANOTHER

03:01:31.513 --> 03:01:33.682
STATE BROUGHT IN THE FEDERAL

03:01:33.749 --> 03:01:35.284
MONEY.

03:01:35.351 --> 03:01:37.186
I BELIEVE THAT WE WERE ALREADY

03:01:37.253 --> 03:01:38.954
IN THE PROCESS OF FIXING THAT I

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:40.489
CAN'T CHANGE.

03:01:40.556 --> 03:01:41.857
THE PERCEPTION FROM THE PAST AND

03:01:41.924 --> 03:01:43.859
I I'M IS TROUBLED BY IT ISSUE

03:01:43.926 --> 03:01:46.028
ARE AND WELL I MEAN I'M I DON'T

03:01:46.095 --> 03:01:47.496
FEEL BADLY ABOUT BEING ON THE

03:01:47.563 --> 03:01:48.797
AUDIT COMMITTEE.

03:01:48.864 --> 03:01:49.832
I AM VERY HAPPY I AM ON THE

03:01:49.898 --> 03:01:51.066
AUDIT COMMITTEE.

03:01:51.133 --> 03:01:53.335
AND THAT'S WHY IN TWO THOUSAND

03:01:53.402 --> 03:01:55.638
AND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN WHEN WE

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:59.408
WHEN WE REQUIRE THOSE AUDITS --

03:01:59.475 --> 03:02:01.443
WE DID THAT BECAUSE OF CONCERN

03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:03.579
AND WE WERE WORKING ON IT --

03:02:03.646 --> 03:02:05.581
THROUGH TWO THOUSAND AND

03:02:05.648 --> 03:02:07.616
SEVENTEEN AND PUT IN PLACE AT

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:08.617
LEAST THE POLICIES AND

03:02:08.684 --> 03:02:10.753
PROCEDURES WHICH ARE FAR GROUP

03:02:10.819 --> 03:02:12.988
FAR MORE THAN THE STATE'S.

CHALLENGE IS HERE AND IT'S VERY

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:30.306

EVOLVED SINCE? TWO THOUSAND FOR

03:06:42.391 --> 03:06:42.958
FROM THE FIRST BUSINESS PLAN TO

03:06:43.025 --> 03:06:45.227
WHAT IT IS NOW.

03:06:45.294 --> 03:06:45.994
FROM.

03:06:46.061 --> 03:06:47.229
IT FROM --

03:06:47.296 --> 03:06:48.230
COST PERSPECTIVE ON FROM THE

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:52.501
FROM THE ACT AT MINUS ANYWAY AS

VOTERS VOTED. FOR HIGH SPEED

03:06:57.839 --> 03:07:00.676
RAIL OR WHEN A IT WAS TO BE A

03:07:00.742 --> 03:07:02.945
STANDALONE PROJECT.

03:07:03.011 --> 03:07:04.446
IS THAT THE CASE CURRENTLY.

03:07:04.513 --> 03:07:06.748
IT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

03:07:06.815 --> 03:07:08.617
IS THERE IS BLENDING AND UTILIZE

03:07:08.684 --> 03:07:11.753
UTILIZING AT OTHER EXISTING

03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:14.022
RIGHT AT BOTH RIGHTS OF WAY AND

03:07:14.089 --> 03:07:15.457
IMPROVEMENTS.

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:18.627
AS PRIMARILY IN YOU KNOW IN THE

03:07:18.694 --> 03:07:20.495
IN THE SHED IN THE CORNER AT SAN

03:07:20.562 --> 03:07:22.164
JOSE SAN FRANCISCO.

03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:23.265
AND MORE RECENTLY AS WE'VE

03:07:23.332 --> 03:07:25.467
IDENTIFIED IN THE TWO THOUSAND

03:07:25.534 --> 03:07:27.970
EIGHTEEN PLAN FROM GILROY. TO

03:07:28.036 --> 03:07:29.504
SAN JOSE AND THEN FROM OF

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:31.807
BURBANK IT DOWN TO LOS ANGELES

03:07:31.873 --> 03:07:33.041
UNION STATION.

03:07:33.108 --> 03:07:35.544
AND IS AUDITOR POINTED OUT I

03:07:35.611 --> 03:07:36.878
THINK WAS TEN SOMETHING.

03:07:36.945 --> 03:07:38.413
THAT BILLION OR TWELVE SOMETHING

03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:40.082
BILLION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:41.450
REDUCE COSTS WERE.

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:45.887
WHAT WE FOCUSED ON MISTER

03:07:45.954 --> 03:07:46.989
MYSTERY AT FONG?

03:07:47.055 --> 03:07:49.091
IS HOW DO WE CONTROL COSTS.

03:07:49.157 --> 03:07:49.992
AND HOW DO WE AT THE SAME TIME

03:07:50.058 --> 03:07:51.526
CONTROL COSTS.

03:07:51.593 --> 03:07:55.230
AND COMPLY WITH PROPOSITION ONE

03:07:55.297 --> 03:07:59.768
A SO BY I BUT TO MY ORIGINAL

03:07:59.835 --> 03:08:01.637
POINT RIGHT WHICH IS THAT IT'S

03:08:01.703 --> 03:08:02.971
NO LONGER WHAT THAT WHAT THE

03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:04.373
VOTERS VOTED.

03:08:04.439 --> 03:08:05.774
WITH THREE WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:08:05.841 --> 03:08:06.908
WAS NO LONGER STAND ALONE

03:08:06.975 --> 03:08:08.744
PROJECT WITH RESPECT RESPECT

03:08:08.810 --> 03:08:09.645
RESPECT --

03:08:09.711 --> 03:08:11.179
TO THE STANDALONE PROJECT TAX

03:08:11.246 --> 03:08:12.214
CORRECT.

03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:13.949
WHEN MISTER KELLY TESTIFIED

03:08:14.016 --> 03:08:16.318
BEFORE US AND WE PROBABLY BACK

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:17.786
OF THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATED THAT

03:08:17.853 --> 03:08:18.153
THE PROJECT --

03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:20.656
PASSES PROBABLY FIFTY FOUR

03:08:20.722 --> 03:08:22.190
BILLION DOLLARS BY.

03:08:22.257 --> 03:08:25.427
A MADE IF YOU IF YOU FACTOR IN

03:08:25.494 --> 03:08:25.961
IN MAY AND IF YOU READ THE

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:29.998
BUSINESS THE PROJECT A PASS AS

03:08:30.065 --> 03:08:31.633
AN UNFUNDED ASSET.

03:08:31.700 --> 03:08:33.135
THAT IS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT

03:08:33.201 --> 03:08:35.270
SO WHERE THERE IS NO FOR FUNDING

03:08:35.337 --> 03:08:37.139
FOR RIGHT NOW THAT'S GRAND RIGHT

03:08:37.205 --> 03:08:38.907
SO SO AS MISTER PASS AND

03:08:38.974 --> 03:08:40.275
PATTERSON ALLIED WE HAVE.

03:08:40.342 --> 03:08:42.844
A CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT THAT

03:08:42.911 --> 03:08:44.813
RIGHT NOW IS.

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:45.047
WE GOT.

03:08:45.113 --> 03:08:46.615
TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND THEN

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:49.718
YOU'VE GOT THE BAY AREA SEGMENT.

03:08:49.785 --> 03:08:51.119
RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T CONNECT.

03:08:51.186 --> 03:08:52.721
RIGHT SO IS THAT THAT'S A THAT

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:55.791
IS A TRUE STATEMENT.

03:08:55.857 --> 03:08:56.792
IT'S A TRUE STATEMENT THAT WE

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:58.360
HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING

03:08:58.427 --> 03:09:00.762
FOR ANYTHING THAT BEYOND WHAT

03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:02.931
YOU MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.933
RIGHT I'VE ADDED BY THE FUNDING

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:05.934
FOR IT AND FIND IT A WE COULD

03:09:06.001 --> 03:09:07.069
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT NUMBER SO NOT

03:09:07.135 --> 03:09:07.669
STUDENTS IN TERMS OF HOW TO

03:09:07.736 --> 03:09:08.537
DEFINE THAT BUT RIGHT NOW THERE

03:09:08.603 --> 03:09:09.705
IS NO MONEY FOR THAT SECTION

03:09:09.771 --> 03:09:10.972
THAT'S GREAT SO WE DO HAVE SO

03:09:11.039 --> 03:09:13.108
RIGHT NOW THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING.

03:09:13.175 --> 03:09:15.610
AT A PROJECT THAT IS.

03:09:15.677 --> 03:09:17.379
THAT DOESN'T CONNECT.

03:09:17.446 --> 03:09:18.680
WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE

03:09:18.747 --> 03:09:19.781
THAT THAT'S CORRECT [inaudible]

03:09:19.848 --> 03:09:21.883
RIGHT.

03:09:21.950 --> 03:09:23.185
AND AND SO DO YOU THINK THE

03:09:23.251 --> 03:09:25.454
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT.

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:27.122
I THINK FROM --

03:09:27.189 --> 03:09:28.790
FROM THE EIGHT YEARS OF BOARD

03:09:28.857 --> 03:09:29.591
MEETINGS THAT --

03:09:29.658 --> 03:09:31.593
I'VE ATTENDED I THINK THAT AT

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:33.261
LEAST THE PUBLIC BECOMES AND

03:09:33.328 --> 03:09:34.262
ADDRESSES THIS BOARD CLEARLY

03:09:34.329 --> 03:09:36.631
UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU THINK THE

03:09:36.698 --> 03:09:39.167
PUBLIC WOULD ACCEPT THAT.

03:09:39.234 --> 03:09:39.935
THAT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

03:09:40.001 --> 03:09:41.803
PUBLIC I MEAN I THINK THE

03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:43.138
DECISIONS THAT WE MADE OUR CLEAR

03:09:43.205 --> 03:09:44.940
WITH IS IT WITH REGARDS TO

03:09:45.006 --> 03:09:46.174
BLENDING --

03:09:46.241 --> 03:09:47.509
WERE NOT NECESSARILY

03:09:47.576 --> 03:09:49.544
CONTEMPLATED IN PROPOSITION ONE

03:09:49.611 --> 03:09:51.813
NAY BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THE

03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:53.048
RESULT OF IT IS IS IT

03:09:53.115 --> 03:09:54.783
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COSTS

03:09:54.850 --> 03:09:56.151
THAT WE WERE SEEING.

03:09:56.218 --> 03:09:58.453
WHEN WE CAME IN AND JOINED THE

03:09:58.520 --> 03:10:01.690
BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND AND?

03:10:01.757 --> 03:10:03.258
TWELVE I'LL JUST IN MY AND MY

03:10:03.325 --> 03:10:05.093
LAST STATEMENT IS IT IS IT IS

03:10:05.160 --> 03:10:06.428
AYE AYE AYE REPRESENT.

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:07.796
OF COURSE KERN COUNTY THEM AND

03:10:07.863 --> 03:10:08.764
SO WE ARE AFFECTED AS WELL FROM

03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:10.499
THIS PROJECT AND THE

03:10:10.565 --> 03:10:13.435
FRUSTRATIONS I HEAR FROM MY

03:10:13.502 --> 03:10:15.203
CONSTITUENTS --

03:10:15.270 --> 03:10:17.672
AB ARE PRETTY INTENSE AND SO.

03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:20.308
WHEN THE REPORT CONCLUDES?

03:10:20.375 --> 03:10:21.409
AND THAT THE AUTHORITIES FLOOD

03:10:21.476 --> 03:10:22.711
DECISION MAKING REGARDING THE

03:10:22.778 --> 03:10:24.112
START OF HIGH SPEED WITH OF THE

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.046
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM

03:10:25.113 --> 03:10:25.981
CONSTRUCTION IN THE CENTER

03:10:26.047 --> 03:10:26.515
VALLEY.

03:10:26.581 --> 03:10:27.983
ITS ONGOING POOR CONTRACT

03:10:28.049 --> 03:10:29.684
MANAGEMENT FOR A WIDE RANGE OF

03:10:29.751 --> 03:10:30.418
HIGH VALUE CONTRACTS HAVE

03:10:30.485 --> 03:10:31.853
CONTRIBUTED TO BILLIONS OF

03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:33.355
DOLLARS IN COST OVER RUNS FROM

03:10:33.421 --> 03:10:35.123
COMPLETING THE SYSTEM WHICH IS

03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.690
IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH THIS

03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:37.392
AUDIT.

03:10:37.459 --> 03:10:38.960
THAT IS A TRUE STATEMENT.

03:10:39.027 --> 03:10:40.295
I DON'T BELIEVE I DON'T I WOULD

03:10:40.362 --> 03:10:41.897
NOT CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY NOW

03:10:41.963 --> 03:10:42.964
BUT THE PERCEPTION IS NOW

03:10:43.031 --> 03:10:44.933
BECOMING A REALITY AND I THINK

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:46.568
WELL AND AND AND AND NO MATTER

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:47.836
HOW YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU'VE BUILT

03:10:47.903 --> 03:10:49.171
IN THESE OVER RENTS ARE NOT.

03:10:49.237 --> 03:10:52.541
I'M LOOKING AT EIGHT FORTY TWO

03:10:52.607 --> 03:10:53.441
BILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE AT THE

03:10:53.508 --> 03:10:55.177
BEGINNING IN TWENTY TEN AND I'M

03:10:55.243 --> 03:10:57.145
LOOKING OUT A PROJECT SEVEN

03:10:57.212 --> 03:10:58.180
SEVEN BILLION TO NINETY EIGHT

03:10:58.246 --> 03:10:58.880
BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A

03:10:58.947 --> 03:11:00.549
PRETTY WIDE RANGE.

03:11:00.615 --> 03:11:02.584
RIGHT IT'S TWENTY BILLION

03:11:02.651 --> 03:11:03.518
DOLLARS.

03:11:03.585 --> 03:11:05.287
AND SO THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT

03:11:05.353 --> 03:11:07.656
INCREASE AND OF COURSE YOU NOW

03:11:07.722 --> 03:11:08.857
YOU TELL ME THAT A DOCTOR CAN

03:11:08.924 --> 03:11:10.892
ACT AS UNFUNDED AND THEN NOW WE

03:11:10.959 --> 03:11:12.194
DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO

03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:13.428
GO OVER A HUNDRED BILLION

03:11:13.495 --> 03:11:13.695
DOLLARS.

03:11:13.762 --> 03:11:14.696
WILL.

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:17.199
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

03:11:17.265 --> 03:11:18.400
COMPLETELY FUNDED FROM THE

03:11:18.466 --> 03:11:21.002
OUTSET TO FORTY TWO BILLION OR

03:11:21.069 --> 03:11:22.270
THIRTY FIVE BILLION OR WHATEVER

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:22.938
IT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED YOUR

03:11:23.004 --> 03:11:24.206
POINT TO THAT POINT I DON'T

03:11:24.272 --> 03:11:25.240
THINK THE CAP THE CALIFORNIA

03:11:25.307 --> 03:11:26.975
PUBLIC KNEW THAT WAS EVEN THE

03:11:27.042 --> 03:11:29.711
CASE EITHER.

03:11:29.778 --> 03:11:30.912
DID YOU DID WHEN YOU WENT TO THE

03:11:30.979 --> 03:11:32.948
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND SAID WE

03:11:33.014 --> 03:11:34.082
WANT YOU TO BOND FOR A HIGH

03:11:34.149 --> 03:11:35.717
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FOR SOMETHING

03:11:35.784 --> 03:11:37.185
THAT WON'T COVER THE COSTS OF

03:11:37.252 --> 03:11:39.120
THE WHOLE PROJECT.

03:11:39.187 --> 03:11:41.790
DID ANYONE EVER SAY THAT.

03:11:41.857 --> 03:11:43.525
IT WAS BEFORE MY TIME I REALLY

03:11:43.592 --> 03:11:45.660
CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION CELL I

03:11:45.727 --> 03:11:47.195
I JUST LIKE THIS IS I MEAN I I

03:11:47.262 --> 03:11:47.896
KNOW.

03:11:47.963 --> 03:11:48.997
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME TESTIFYING

03:11:49.064 --> 03:11:49.631
AND I I HATE TO BE A LITTLE HARD

03:11:49.698 --> 03:11:51.499
ON YOU BUT I MEAN THESE ARE REAL

03:11:51.566 --> 03:11:52.901
CONCERNS.

03:11:52.968 --> 03:11:54.870
AND AND AS THE AS US WHO HAVE

03:11:54.936 --> 03:11:56.037
BEEN ELECTED TO BE STEWARDS AT

03:11:56.104 --> 03:11:57.739
CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLAR.

03:11:57.806 --> 03:11:59.674
WE HAVE TO ASK THESE HARD

03:11:59.741 --> 03:12:01.743
QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE THE PEOPLE

03:12:01.810 --> 03:12:02.844
LOAN AS THE POWER FOR TWO YEARS

03:12:02.911 --> 03:12:03.979
AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

03:12:04.045 --> 03:12:05.513
DECISION WE HAVE TO MAKE SO I

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:06.147
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:07.716
APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE

03:12:07.782 --> 03:12:09.751
QUESTIONS THINKING.

03:12:09.818 --> 03:12:10.919
TWICE YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:11.786
MISTER CHAIR MISTER RICHARDS

03:12:11.853 --> 03:12:13.521
MISTER HEDGES THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:12:13.588 --> 03:12:14.923
TESTIMONY.

03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:18.560
I CAN TELL YOU IS A LAWYER I GET

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:20.595
CAUGHT MOST.

03:12:20.662 --> 03:12:21.396
TO I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU THANK

03:12:21.463 --> 03:12:22.597
YOU VERY MUCH FOR UNDERSTANDING

03:12:22.664 --> 03:12:23.632
AND SO I ALSO WANT TO TELL YOU

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:23.932
THAT -- YOU

03:12:23.999 --> 03:12:24.499
KNOW PERSONALLY I HAVE THE

03:12:24.566 --> 03:12:27.002
HIGHEST RESPECT FOR BRIAN KELLY.

03:12:27.068 --> 03:12:28.236
DID SOME EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN

03:12:28.303 --> 03:12:29.905
HIS OTHER POSITIONS AROUND HERE

03:12:29.971 --> 03:12:31.473
AND YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM WE

03:12:31.539 --> 03:12:33.808
ARE I HAVE A QUESTION I GUESS IS

03:12:33.875 --> 03:12:35.911
SORT OF A CONCERN YOU KNOW THE

03:12:35.977 --> 03:12:36.678
AUDIT REPORT.

03:12:36.745 --> 03:12:38.079
AND CERTAINLY THIS HEARINGS

03:12:38.146 --> 03:12:40.749
PROPERLY FOCUSED ON HAS BEEN THE

03:12:40.815 --> 03:12:43.652
DEFICIENCIES --

03:12:43.718 --> 03:12:44.986
IN THOSE AREAS THAT --

03:12:45.053 --> 03:12:47.389
IMPACTED PROJECT COMPLETION COST

03:12:47.455 --> 03:12:48.523
AND OF COURSE THE DELAYS HAVE

03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:50.258
BEEN SIGNIFICANT [inaudible]

03:12:50.325 --> 03:12:53.094
AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME

03:12:53.161 --> 03:12:55.497
OF US THE COST INCREASES OF BEEN

03:12:55.563 --> 03:12:57.299
BREATHTAKING.

03:12:57.365 --> 03:13:00.669
BUT I WANT TO STEP BACK AND AND

03:13:00.735 --> 03:13:03.171
AND ASK A QUESTION BUT FIRST.

03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:04.639
SET THE STAGE FOR MY QUESTION.

03:13:04.706 --> 03:13:05.907
YOU KNOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

03:13:05.974 --> 03:13:07.409
THAT MODERN DAY HIGH SPEED RAIL

03:13:07.475 --> 03:13:09.177
PROBABLY DATES BACK TO THE JAPAN

03:13:09.244 --> 03:13:11.146
MAYBE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR

03:13:11.212 --> 03:13:12.514
BEFORE THE OLYMPICS.

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:14.082
AND THEN FOLLOWED BY ITALY AND

03:13:14.149 --> 03:13:15.617
FRANCE THAT'S ALMOST FIFTY YEARS

03:13:15.684 --> 03:13:17.152
AGO.

03:13:17.218 --> 03:13:18.653
AND IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING

03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:19.788
THAT AT LEAST SOME FORM OF A

03:13:19.854 --> 03:13:21.556
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WAS

03:13:21.623 --> 03:13:22.958
OPERATIONAL IN GERMANY.

03:13:23.024 --> 03:13:24.826
AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTY

03:13:24.893 --> 03:13:27.095
THREE MAYBE FROM THIRTY THREE TO

03:13:27.162 --> 03:13:27.729
THIRTY NINE AND THAT'S CERTAINLY

03:13:27.796 --> 03:13:30.065
OVER. EIGHTY YEARS AGO SO.

03:13:30.131 --> 03:13:32.100
THIS IS NOT A A NEW TECHNOLOGY

03:13:32.167 --> 03:13:34.502
AT LEAST IN ITS BASIC FORM.

03:13:34.569 --> 03:13:35.603
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:37.572
PROJECTIONS FOR COMPLETION OF

03:13:37.639 --> 03:13:42.310
PHASE ONE OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTY

03:13:42.377 --> 03:13:43.645
THREE MAYBE LATER MAYBE MUCH

03:13:43.712 --> 03:13:47.949
LATER MAYBE. TWENTY FIFTY GIVEN

03:13:48.016 --> 03:13:49.284
ALL THAT AND GIVEN THE

03:13:49.351 --> 03:13:51.252
EXTRAORDINARY SPEED WITH WHICH

03:13:51.319 --> 03:13:52.821
TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING WITH

03:13:52.887 --> 03:13:54.489
RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION IN THE

03:13:54.556 --> 03:13:57.325
TRANSPORTATION OF OF PEOPLE FROM

03:13:57.392 --> 03:13:58.827
ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WHETHER

03:13:58.893 --> 03:13:59.961
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TON WAS

03:14:00.028 --> 03:14:00.996
VEHICLES --

03:14:01.062 --> 03:14:03.264
HYPERLOOP --

03:14:03.331 --> 03:14:05.166
TRANSPORT.

03:14:05.233 --> 03:14:06.701
I GUESS THIS IS MY QUESTION.

03:14:06.768 --> 03:14:08.169
HAS ANYONE INSIDE YOUR

03:14:08.236 --> 03:14:10.271
ORGANIZATION OR OUTSIDE YOUR

03:14:10.338 --> 03:14:12.640
ORGANIZATION --

03:14:12.707 --> 03:14:13.408
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE TAKEN A STEP

03:14:13.475 --> 03:14:15.143
BACK CLIMBED UP TO THIRTY

03:14:15.210 --> 03:14:15.844
THOUSAND FEET.

03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:18.013
AND REASSESS THE CONTINUED

03:14:18.079 --> 03:14:20.615
VIABILITY OF A OF THE CONCEPT OF

03:14:20.682 --> 03:14:22.083
A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM.

03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:26.121
IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY THREE OR

03:14:26.187 --> 03:14:26.688
TWO THOUSAND FIFTY OR BEYOND

03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:28.656
BECAUSE SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION

03:14:28.723 --> 03:14:30.191
DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY AND

03:14:30.258 --> 03:14:31.593
IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE

03:14:31.659 --> 03:14:33.328
THE END OF THE QUESTION BECAUSE

03:14:33.395 --> 03:14:36.031
WE GOT A FACE.

03:14:36.097 --> 03:14:37.565
TO OR ARE WE SIMPLY BENT ON AUTO

03:14:37.632 --> 03:14:38.700
PILOT SENSE.

03:14:38.767 --> 03:14:40.001
NOT A CRITICISM BUT SIMPLY BEEN

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:42.904
ON AUTO PILOT SINCE NINETEEN

03:14:42.971 --> 03:14:43.505
NINETY SIX OR TWO THOUSAND OR

03:14:43.571 --> 03:14:45.140
EVEN. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT

03:14:45.206 --> 03:14:48.443
WITH RESPECT.

03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:50.478
WELL IN THE AUTO PILOT NEVER GOT

03:14:50.545 --> 03:14:53.381
ENGAGED ON THIS FORTUNATELY BUT

03:14:53.448 --> 03:14:56.551
WE PAID WE PAY ATTENTION.

03:14:56.618 --> 03:14:58.353
TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE GOING ON

03:14:58.420 --> 03:15:00.455
AT LEAST --

03:15:00.522 --> 03:15:01.723
BEING CONSIDERED TO HAVE

03:15:01.790 --> 03:15:03.191
POTENTIALLY DEVELOP AND THAT

03:15:03.258 --> 03:15:04.826
SORT OF THING WHAT WE ALSO

03:15:04.893 --> 03:15:06.561
NOTICES THAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY

03:15:06.628 --> 03:15:08.863
BEING BUILT ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:11.232
CONTINUES TO BE HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:15:11.299 --> 03:15:13.301
IT'S A PROVEN AT TRANSPORTATION

03:15:13.368 --> 03:15:16.504
ALTERNATIVE AT SPEECH THAT ARE --

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:18.073
GREATER THAN ANY OTHER.

03:15:18.139 --> 03:15:20.341
FORM OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION

03:15:20.408 --> 03:15:21.609
AND WHILE WE READ ALSO ABOUT

03:15:21.676 --> 03:15:23.178
HYPERLOOP AND MAGLEV AND ALL

03:15:23.244 --> 03:15:25.814
THAT SORT OF THING --

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:28.349
WE DON'T WE DON'T GET IS SICK WE

03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:30.685
DON'T SIMPLY --

03:15:30.752 --> 03:15:32.053
TAKE A POSITION THAT IT'S IT IT

03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:34.122
MAY NOT BE VIABLE AT SOME POINT

03:15:34.189 --> 03:15:35.623
IN THE FUTURE BUT WHAT WE'RE

03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:37.292
DOING IS WE DON'T SEE IN THE

03:15:37.358 --> 03:15:38.726
NEAR TERM --

03:15:38.793 --> 03:15:42.397
OR DURING DURING THE LIFE OF A

03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:43.865
HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT'S

03:15:43.932 --> 03:15:45.834
JUST BEING BUILT THAT IT IS

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.469
NECESSARILY GOING TO BE SURE

03:15:47.535 --> 03:15:49.337
PASSED BY OTHER FORMS OF SURFACE

03:15:49.404 --> 03:15:50.371
TRANSPORTATION.

03:15:50.438 --> 03:15:53.541
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS AS THOUGH IT

03:15:53.608 --> 03:15:56.978
MEETS PERFECT ROUGHLY GEOGRAPHY

03:15:57.045 --> 03:15:58.680
GEOGRAPHY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE

03:15:58.746 --> 03:16:00.081
GOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL I

03:16:00.148 --> 03:16:01.883
UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE HIGH SPEED

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:03.218
REAL STORIES YOU IN THE PORTS

03:16:03.284 --> 03:16:04.252
YOU AND I'M SURE YOU TALK ABOUT

03:16:04.319 --> 03:16:04.786
IT.

03:16:04.853 --> 03:16:06.221
BUT HAS THERE BEEN A TIGER TEAM

03:16:06.287 --> 03:16:08.990
PUT TOGETHER OR PROJECT TEAM.

03:16:09.057 --> 03:16:10.625
SOME OTHER GROUP TO ACTUALLY

03:16:10.692 --> 03:16:13.528
STUDY THE IMPACT OF EXTRA.

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:15.497
A CHANGING STRUCTURE CHANGES IN

03:16:15.563 --> 03:16:17.899
TECHNOLOGY JUST IN THE SIX YEARS

03:16:17.966 --> 03:16:19.901
THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TO COMPARE

03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:21.603
THAT TO THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT

03:16:21.669 --> 03:16:22.303
WAS.

03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:24.706
TO BE STARTED TO PUT TOGETHER IN

03:16:24.772 --> 03:16:26.374
NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND TWO

03:16:26.441 --> 03:16:28.610
THOUSAND THAT'S NINETY SIX IS A

03:16:28.676 --> 03:16:29.978
LONG TIME IN TWO THOUSAND IS

03:16:30.044 --> 03:16:31.446
RAPIDLY APPROACHING NINETEEN

03:16:31.513 --> 03:16:33.348
YEARS AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF

03:16:33.414 --> 03:16:34.983
ANYBODY IS REALLY TAKING THIS

03:16:35.049 --> 03:16:37.252
THING DOWN TO THE TO THE ROOTS

03:16:37.318 --> 03:16:39.420
AND AND TAKEN A LOOK AT IT.

03:16:39.487 --> 03:16:41.689
OR ARE WE SIMPLY MOVING AHEAD

03:16:41.756 --> 03:16:43.191
BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT.

03:16:43.258 --> 03:16:44.993
WHATEVER IT IS TWO POINT SIX

03:16:45.059 --> 03:16:46.561
BILLION DOLLARS OF THREE POINT

03:16:46.628 --> 03:16:47.896
FIVE BILLION IN WE NEED TO KEEP

03:16:47.962 --> 03:16:49.464
MARCHING HONOR WE HAVE.

03:16:49.531 --> 03:16:51.199
TO CONSIDER WHAT THE OFFRAMP IS

03:16:51.266 --> 03:16:52.534
OR HOW WE PAY IT BACK.

03:16:52.600 --> 03:16:54.068
IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION I THINK

03:16:54.135 --> 03:16:55.637
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION --

03:16:55.703 --> 03:16:58.139
AND I AM NOT AWARE OF IT AT THE

03:16:58.206 --> 03:16:59.908
TIGER TEAM THAT HAVING BEEN

03:16:59.974 --> 03:17:01.242
FORMED --

03:17:01.309 --> 03:17:02.610

03:17:09.517 --> 03:17:11.586
CHANGES --

03:17:11.653 --> 03:17:13.922
ONE THING THAT IS A ASSET THAT

03:17:13.988 --> 03:17:15.623
SURVIVES ALL OF THAT IS THE

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:16.925
RIGHT OF WAY.

03:17:16.991 --> 03:17:18.660
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

03:17:18.726 --> 03:17:21.062
AND IT HAS IN THE TAXPAYERS HAVE

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:22.697
PAID -- FOR

03:17:22.764 --> 03:17:24.032
WHETHER THAT RIGHT OF WAY AT

03:17:24.098 --> 03:17:26.701
SOME POINT MAY SUPPORT MAG LEV

03:17:26.768 --> 03:17:28.803

03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:30.271

03:17:33.841 --> 03:17:35.109
IS NOT A LOST ASSET FOR THE

03:17:35.176 --> 03:17:37.078
TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF

03:23:40.474 --> 03:23:42.276
AND I'VE STRUGGLED OVER THE

03:23:42.343 --> 03:23:43.678
YEARS THINKING WAS IT REALLY

03:23:43.744 --> 03:23:44.812
WISE TO STAY HERE BECAUSE I IT

03:23:44.879 --> 03:23:46.714
EARLY ON MY REACTION TO FRESNO

03:23:46.781 --> 03:23:48.349
I'VE NEVER.

03:23:48.416 --> 03:23:49.317
SEEN A COMMUNITY THAT IT

03:23:49.383 --> 03:23:50.751
APPEARED TO HAVE SUCH A LOW SELF

03:23:50.818 --> 03:23:52.286
ESTEEM.

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:54.055
AND IT REALLY WAS IT WAS REALLY

03:23:54.121 --> 03:23:55.489
ALARMING --

03:23:55.556 --> 03:23:58.259
BUT WHAT I A RECOGNIZED OVER THE

03:23:58.326 --> 03:24:00.494
YEARS THIS LOW ESTEEM WAS THE

03:24:00.561 --> 03:24:03.531
RESULT OF A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY

03:24:03.598 --> 03:24:03.831
[inaudible]

03:24:03.898 --> 03:24:06.567
AND THERE'S A PERCEPTION IN THE

03:24:06.634 --> 03:24:08.235
VALLEY THAT WHEN THINGS HAPPEN

03:24:08.302 --> 03:24:09.537
IN THIS STATE.

03:24:09.604 --> 03:24:10.871
THEY NEVER FIND THEIR WAY OUT OF

03:24:10.938 --> 03:24:12.340
THE BAY AREA AND THEY NEVER FIND

03:24:12.406 --> 03:24:13.240
THEIR WAY OUT OF SOUTHERN

03:24:13.307 --> 03:24:14.942
CALIFORNIA SO SITTING IN A

03:24:15.009 --> 03:24:16.310
POSITION LIKE THIS WHERE I

03:24:16.377 --> 03:24:17.912
REALLY REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF

03:24:17.979 --> 03:24:19.614
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:22.083
I TRIED AND I TRY TO MONITOR HOW

03:24:22.149 --> 03:24:23.651
I REALLY FEEL ABOUT.

03:24:23.718 --> 03:24:25.519
MY JOB BUT WHEN I GET THE

03:24:25.586 --> 03:24:27.321
OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

03:24:27.388 --> 03:24:28.155
IS IT DOING FOR CENTRAL

03:24:28.222 --> 03:24:32.360
CALIFORNIA IT'S UNBELIEVABLE --

03:24:32.426 --> 03:24:35.329
WE HAVE GENERATED THOSE JOBS IN

03:24:35.396 --> 03:24:37.732
SOME PART WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:24:37.798 --> 03:24:39.066
BEEN UNEMPLOYED FOR YEARS.

03:24:39.133 --> 03:24:42.470

IT WENT TO SUPPORTING COHORTS

03:24:56.684 --> 03:24:57.718
FOR TRAINING.

03:24:57.785 --> 03:24:59.754
AND THE INTERESTING THING IS

03:24:59.820 --> 03:25:01.489
THESE PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THOSE

03:25:01.555 --> 03:25:03.557
CORE HOOKED CO WORDS ARE GETTING

03:25:03.624 --> 03:25:04.592
JOBS.

03:25:04.659 --> 03:25:05.793
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT HIGH

HALF BILLION DOLLARS UNHEARD OF

03:25:53.507 --> 03:25:54.975
OFTEN WHAT I THOUGHT.

03:25:55.042 --> 03:25:56.210
AND I THINK THIS ABOUT HIGH

03:25:56.277 --> 03:25:58.512
SPEED RAIL --

03:25:58.579 --> 03:26:00.114
A LOT YOU KNOW AND WE WERE

03:26:00.181 --> 03:26:01.949
FORTUNATE IN MY MIND TO GET THE

03:26:02.016 --> 03:26:03.751
OUR SONS AND WE HAD 17%

03:26:03.818 --> 03:26:05.786
UNEMPLOYMENT.

03:26:05.853 --> 03:26:07.988
BUT WHAT I SAID WHEN I'VE HAD AN

03:26:08.055 --> 03:26:10.791
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO GROUPS.

03:26:10.858 --> 03:26:11.459
IS THAT.

03:26:11.525 --> 03:26:13.928
THE NEAR TERM JOBS WHICH WERE ON

03:26:13.994 --> 03:26:16.063
THE CAKE.

03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:18.299
BECAUSE THE REAL OPPORTUNITY

03:26:18.365 --> 03:26:20.034
FROM BEING THE FIRST.

03:26:20.101 --> 03:26:21.302
AND THAT'S NOT JUST CENTRAL

03:26:21.368 --> 03:26:22.803
CALIFORNIA IT'S THE ENTIRE STATE

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:25.639
OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE FIRST

03:26:25.706 --> 03:26:27.742
TO BE DOING THIS.

NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

03:26:29.944 --> 03:26:31.812
ENTIRE UNITED STATES AND IN FACT

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.981
ALL OF NORTH AMERICA THERE IS

03:26:34.048 --> 03:26:35.549
NOT A HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:26:35.616 --> 03:26:38.119
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT UNDER WAY

03:26:38.185 --> 03:26:39.987

BELIEVE STRONGLY FOR CENTRAL

03:26:45.226 --> 03:26:46.427
CALIFORNIA.

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:49.063
IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT IS BEING

03:26:49.130 --> 03:26:52.032
GAINED BY ACTUALLY HAVING BEEN

03:26:52.099 --> 03:26:53.467
INVOLVED IN THIS DEVELOPMENT.

03:26:53.534 --> 03:26:55.970
AND ITS CONSTRUCTION AND ITS

03:26:56.036 --> 03:26:58.839
OPERATION WHEN WE GET STARTED.

03:26:58.906 --> 03:27:01.375
THE S. HIGH SPEED RAIL FINDS IT

03:27:01.442 --> 03:27:03.210
SWAY FROM STATE TO STATE TO

03:27:03.277 --> 03:27:04.879
STATE AND AS YOU PROBABLY ARE

03:27:04.945 --> 03:27:05.579

03:27:05.646 --> 03:27:06.747
I MEAN KEPT THEIR WORKING ON IT

03:27:06.814 --> 03:27:08.149
TEXAS THERE WORKING ON IT AGAIN

03:27:08.215 --> 03:27:10.618
I BELIEVE IN OHIO AND WISCONSIN.

03:27:10.684 --> 03:27:13.420
IN FLORIDA --

03:27:13.487 --> 03:27:15.689
WHEN LIKE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE SO

03:27:15.756 --> 03:27:18.292
WELL WHEN PEOPLE START LOOKING

03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:19.894
AT WHERE WHERE WE GONNA GET THE

03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:22.329
EXPERTISE? TO DEVELOPER BUILD

03:27:22.396 --> 03:27:24.865
HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT EXPERTISE

03:27:24.932 --> 03:27:27.301
IS GONNA COME FROM CALIFORNIA.

03:27:27.368 --> 03:27:28.502
WE'RE GONNA EXPORT THAT

03:27:28.569 --> 03:27:30.404
EXPERTISE TO THE OTHER STATES IN

03:27:30.471 --> 03:27:32.206
THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE COME

03:27:32.273 --> 03:27:33.941
UP AND LEARN THE WAY.

03:27:34.008 --> 03:27:36.310
AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF COMPANIES

03:27:36.377 --> 03:27:39.380
THAT ARE WITH SMALL COMPANIES --

03:27:39.446 --> 03:27:40.948
NOW DEVELOPING AND BUILDING HIGH

03:27:41.015 --> 03:27:43.117
SPEED RAIL THAT THEY WILL BE THE

03:27:43.184 --> 03:27:44.351
ONES WHO CAN GENERATE THESE

03:27:44.418 --> 03:27:46.220
OPPORTUNITIES AND BE THE LEADERS

03:27:46.287 --> 03:27:47.655
NOT IN CALIFORNIA.

03:27:47.721 --> 03:27:49.323
BUT THE LEADERS IN THE EXPANSION

03:27:49.390 --> 03:27:50.591
OF HIGH SPEED RAIL ACROSS THE

03:27:50.658 --> 03:27:52.793
COUNTRY IT'S ONLY THE SCRATCHING

03:27:52.860 --> 03:27:54.328
THE SURFACE THE BENEFITS WERE

03:27:54.395 --> 03:27:56.664
GETTING TODAY.

03:27:56.730 --> 03:27:59.633
IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:01.635
I I THINK GOOD JOB JUST.

03:28:01.702 --> 03:28:02.269
YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD STORY AND I

03:28:02.336 --> 03:28:03.804
THINK.

03:28:03.871 --> 03:28:06.006
PERHAPS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

03:28:06.073 --> 03:28:07.741
US A QUESTION AND THE AUDITOR'S

03:28:07.808 --> 03:28:09.710
THEY WANTED A SYSTEMATIC

03:28:09.777 --> 03:28:14.248
REPORTING ON THE ECONOMIC.

03:28:14.315 --> 03:28:16.283
BENEFITS OF ALL THESE

03:28:16.350 --> 03:28:17.952
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

03:28:18.018 --> 03:28:19.987
CERTAINLY SP ONE AND HOUSING

03:28:20.054 --> 03:28:23.424
BOND THOSE OF THE TWO I'VE BEEN

03:28:23.490 --> 03:28:24.358
INVOLVED IN YEAH AND THEN I

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:26.026
THINK.

03:28:26.093 --> 03:28:29.163
WE ARE WE ARE OF KEEP TRACK OR

03:28:29.230 --> 03:28:30.531
ECONOMIC.

03:28:30.598 --> 03:28:31.332
BENEFITS.

03:28:31.398 --> 03:28:32.433
FROM ALL THESE PROJECTS IN A

03:28:32.499 --> 03:28:33.000
SYSTEMATIC --

03:28:33.067 --> 03:28:34.535
WAY.

03:28:34.602 --> 03:28:36.804
AND SO IT IS SO I I WANNA I

03:28:36.871 --> 03:28:39.139
WANNA MOVE DOWN ON A MORE FORMAL

03:28:39.206 --> 03:28:41.408
BASIS -- FOR

03:28:41.475 --> 03:28:43.210
CALIFORNIA I THINK CALIFORNIA

03:28:43.277 --> 03:28:44.712
THE PEOPLE NEED TO SEE --

03:28:44.778 --> 03:28:46.947
OF THE ECONOMIC.

03:28:47.014 --> 03:28:48.315
DEVELOPMENT STORY.

03:28:48.382 --> 03:28:49.683
BETTER THAN THEY'VE BEEN IN THE

03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:51.619
PAST THEY LOOK AT THESE THINGS

03:28:51.685 --> 03:28:52.486
IS LIKE.

03:28:52.553 --> 03:28:55.923
COST RATHER THAN AN INVESTMENT.

03:28:55.990 --> 03:28:56.590
HANNAH AND I THINK --

03:28:56.657 --> 03:28:58.659
THAT'S PART OF IT.

03:28:58.726 --> 03:28:59.627
SO -- DO YOU

03:28:59.693 --> 03:29:00.928
HAVE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS

03:29:00.995 --> 03:29:02.830
ABOUT --

03:29:02.897 --> 03:29:04.632
LAKE VISION WISE AFTER HIGH

03:29:04.698 --> 03:29:06.600
SPEED REELS BUILD.

03:29:06.667 --> 03:29:08.736
JUST -- SO I

03:29:08.802 --> 03:29:09.370
CAN TELL MY PEOPLE IN SAN JOSE.

03:29:09.436 --> 03:29:11.038
HOW?

03:29:11.105 --> 03:29:14.174
SILICON VALLEY AND FRESNO.

03:29:14.241 --> 03:29:15.809
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN TERMS OF

03:29:15.876 --> 03:29:16.677
THE?

03:29:16.744 --> 03:29:18.913
SYNERGY BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS

03:29:18.979 --> 03:29:20.414
YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT IT

03:29:20.481 --> 03:29:22.583
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO IN AND

03:29:22.650 --> 03:29:24.652
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE JUST

03:29:24.718 --> 03:29:25.853
WANTED TO YOU KNOW IT AT A CHAIR

03:29:25.920 --> 03:29:28.022
AT THE TABLE THE ECONOMIC TABLE

03:29:28.088 --> 03:29:28.856
CALIFORNIA.

03:29:28.923 --> 03:29:30.291
AND THE BIG ONE OF THE BIGGEST

03:29:30.357 --> 03:29:32.493
CHALLENGES TO CENTRAL VALLEY IS

03:29:32.559 --> 03:29:33.661
HAD AND STE SPECIFIC

03:29:33.727 --> 03:29:36.363
SPECIFICALLY FRESNO IS JUST HOW

03:29:36.430 --> 03:29:38.899
DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET THERE.

03:29:38.966 --> 03:29:40.534
IF YOU'RE DEALING.

03:29:40.601 --> 03:29:42.069
IN SOME SORT OF THE BUSINESS

03:29:42.136 --> 03:29:42.903
ENVIRONMENT WHO --

03:29:42.970 --> 03:29:44.505
AIRLINE TRANSPORTATION IS NOT

03:29:44.571 --> 03:29:46.240
THE WAY IT USED TO BE AS YOU AS

03:29:46.307 --> 03:29:48.175
WE ALL KNOW --

03:29:48.242 --> 03:29:50.277
TO HAVE READY ACCESS TO THEIR

CALIFORNIA THE THE SILICON

03:29:55.516 --> 03:29:57.751
VALLEY FROM CALIFORNIA FROM

03:29:57.818 --> 03:29:59.153
FRESHNESS PERSPECTIVE WE'VE GOT.

03:29:59.219 --> 03:30:02.556
A GROWING AND VIBRANT TECHNOLOGY

03:30:02.623 --> 03:30:04.425
INDUSTRY A. --

03:30:04.491 --> 03:30:06.327
IN FRESNO OVER THESE LAST THREE

03:30:06.393 --> 03:30:08.329
OR FOUR YEARS --

03:30:08.395 --> 03:30:11.665
WERE ONE PROBABLY ONE MAJOR A

03:30:11.732 --> 03:30:13.634
BREAKTHROUGH AWAY FROM BUSTING

03:30:13.701 --> 03:30:16.770
OUT OF BEING A MASSIVE NUMBER OF

03:30:16.837 --> 03:30:18.605
SMALL COMPANIES TRYING TO FIGURE

03:30:18.672 --> 03:30:21.275
OUT WHAT'S THE NEXT BEST THING

03:30:21.342 --> 03:30:22.676
IN TECHNOLOGY.

03:30:22.743 --> 03:30:25.746
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE.

03:30:25.813 --> 03:30:27.848
IS THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT

03:30:27.915 --> 03:30:28.882
SENATOR.

03:30:28.949 --> 03:30:31.418
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THIS TO WHAT

03:30:31.485 --> 03:30:33.187

AND THAT WASN'T A GOOD IDEA BAD

03:51:23.936 --> 03:51:25.271
IDEA TO START A CENTRAL VALLEY I

STEPS IT WAS A DELIBERATE

03:51:39.852 --> 03:51:42.288
PROCESS AND THERE WAS SOLID

03:51:42.355 --> 03:51:42.788
BACKGROUND TO MAKE THOSE

03:51:42.855 --> 03:51:43.956
DECISIONS SO.

03:51:44.023 --> 03:51:46.192

DECISION TO START A CENTRAL

03:51:47.193 --> 03:51:47.627
VALLEY.

03:51:47.693 --> 03:51:49.595

TO THAT PROCESS GOING FORWARD.

03:57:03.008 --> 03:57:04.677
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS IS

03:57:04.743 --> 03:57:07.179
BACK IN THE YOUR TO AGO THERE

03:57:07.246 --> 03:57:08.647
WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS LET GO

03:57:08.714 --> 03:57:09.648
FROM THE AUTHORITY.

03:57:09.715 --> 03:57:11.150
THAT WAS JEFF ROUSE.

03:57:11.216 --> 03:57:13.218
I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

03:57:13.285 --> 03:57:16.422
JEFF WAS A PROJECT A AND

03:57:16.488 --> 03:57:18.524
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THE THE

03:57:18.591 --> 03:57:20.125
BUCK STOPS WITH THE THE

03:57:20.192 --> 03:57:21.360
INDIVIDUAL AT THE TOP.

03:57:21.427 --> 03:57:23.195
I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE IT

03:57:23.262 --> 03:57:23.862
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CHAIRMAN OF

03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:25.264
THE BOARD DAN RICHARD SHOULD

03:57:25.331 --> 03:57:26.565
HAVE BEEN LET GO.

03:57:26.632 --> 03:57:28.901
AS AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:57:28.968 --> 03:57:30.803
ALTMAN OVERSIGHT OF ALL OF THIS

03:57:30.869 --> 03:57:32.838
FIASCO HAS BEEN GOING ON AND FOR

03:57:32.905 --> 03:57:33.906

03:57:33.973 --> 03:57:35.507
GOING FORWARD.

03:57:35.574 --> 03:57:37.142
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE.

03:57:37.209 --> 03:57:38.444
AND I THINK THE PEOPLE OF

03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:40.179
CALIFORNIA DESERVE UNDERSTAND

03:57:40.245 --> 03:57:41.981
THAT AT LEAST THERE WAS ONE

03:57:42.047 --> 03:57:43.082
ACTION TAKEN.

03:57:43.148 --> 03:57:44.717
IN THE APPROPRIATE FASHION FOR

03:57:44.783 --> 03:57:46.485
THIS GOING FORWARD.

03:57:46.552 --> 03:57:48.053
AND I THINK THE BOARD NEEDS TO

03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:50.656
LOOK FORWARD. TO BETTER BETTER

03:57:50.723 --> 03:57:52.524
REPRESENTATION FROM THE CHAIRMAN

03:57:52.591 --> 03:57:53.859

03:57:53.926 --> 03:57:56.795
THEY HIRED A CONSTRUCTION STE I

03:57:56.862 --> 03:57:59.064

03:58:03.002 --> 03:58:04.370
ABILITY TO BRING THIS BACK ON

03:58:04.436 --> 03:58:05.938
TRACK.

03:58:06.005 --> 03:58:07.973
BUT SOMEBODY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:09.742
THIS AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT

03:58:09.808 --> 03:58:11.310
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO GO.
