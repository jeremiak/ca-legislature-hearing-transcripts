TO PUT DOWN YOUR SMART. AND TO PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS. THIS IS A BILL THAT'S THE AS WE ALL KNOW WE KNOW HOW IT DETECTIVE SMART PHONES CAN BE. AND THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS POSING A PROBLEM IN OUR CLASSROOMS. THERE'S GROWING EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT ACCESO SMART SMART PHONE USE AT SCHOOL IS INTERFERING WITH OUR STUDENTS EDUCATION. ENCOURAGING CYBER BULLYING AND HAVING ADVERSE EFFECTS ON TEENAGE MENTAL HEALTH. LAST YEAR FRANCE BANS SMARTPHONES IN ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. THERE WAS A STUDY FROM THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS THAT SHOWS THAT THE SMART PHONES AND CLASSROOMS IS HAVING A AN IMPACT ON THE CHIEF AND GAP ESPECIALLY ON THE THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS. AND THAT THERE IS A BOOK A BEST SELLING BOOK ALL CALLED AYE CHEN THAT AS PART OF A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWING THE IMPACTS OF SMARTPHONES EXCESSIVE YOU FEELS OF A SMART PHONES. ON TEENAGE ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE [inaudible] THIS BILL. WILL PERMIT AND HOPEFULLY ENCOURAGE BUT NOT REQUIRE. AS SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ADOPT THEIR OWN POLICY TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN ALLOWING APPROPRIATE STUDENTUSE OF SMARTPHONES WHILE MAKING SURE THAT SMARTPHONES ARE NOT INTERFERING WITH THE STUDENT'S. EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL OR EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS NOT A BILL IF IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW PARENTS TO CONTINUE TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEIR KIDS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND GOOD CAN DO THAT IF YOU WANT TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO USE OF SMARTPHONES AS AN ACADEMIC RESOURCE. STUDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DO THAT. AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN ALLOW STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO USE THEIR SMARTPHONES FOR MEDICAL OR OTHER CAMPUS EMERGENCIES.

POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THAT BUT MORE AND MORE WE HAVE SEEN STUDENTS. ACTUALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF ISOLATION WHERE WE SEE STUDENTS. AT A BREAK PERIOD NOT INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER BUT INTERACTING WITH THEIR PHONES INSTEAD IN ADDITION TO THAT WE SEE THAT MORE AND MORE FAMILIES ARE DOING THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DINNER TABLE OR AT A RESTAURANT. AND WITH THIS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME RESPONSE UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE THE WALDEN SCHOOLS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE NO TECHNOLOGY. BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE TRIED KERR SPITTLE AND SHOCK HOSPITAL JUST OPENED UP BUT ADOLESCENT WARD AND I ASKED HIM WHY AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE SEEN MORE AND MORE SIGNS OF YOUNG ADULTS ADOLESCENTS. WITH SUICIDE THOUGHTS WITH DEPRESSION AND EVEN YOUNG GIRLS AT THE YOUNGEST AGES OF TEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE HAVING ISSUES WITH BULIMIA AND ANOREXIA.

THE STREET OF LUMBAR STREET WHICH WE CALL THE CRICKET STREET -- LUMBAR STREET AS YOU KNOW IS A HUGE TOURIST ATTRACTION IT ATTRACTS UPWARDS OF TWO MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.

GET TO WORK DROP YOUR CHILDREN UP AT SCHOOL GO THE GROCERY STORE WITHOUT HAVING TO GET BACK IN LINE. TO GET BACK INTO YOUR GARAGE SO THIS IS BEEN RESEARCH -- FOR OVER THREE YEARS BY OUR SAN FRANCISCO TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY -- THIS WASN'T THE FIRST SOLUTION BUT THIS IS NOW THE SOLUTION THAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE BEST WAY THE RESERVATION SYSTEM WILL ALLOW TO HAVE LEFT CONGESTION.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER COM LONGER THAT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR GERMAN MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I RISE TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF JOHN DANIEL SINGLETON WHO PASSED AWAY ON APRIL. TWENTY NINE TWENTY NINETEEN AT THE YOUNG AGE OF FIFTY ONE JOHN WAS BORN ON JANUARY SIXTH NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND LOS ANGELES. HE WAS A TALENTED FILM AND TELEVISION DIRECTOR SCREENWRITER AND PRODUCER. AN ALUMNUS OF MY ALMA MATER USC AND A RESIDENT OF THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. JOHN RECEIVED TWO OSCAR NOMINATIONS FOR DIRECTING AND WRITING HIS DEBUT FILM BOYZ IN THE HOOD. JUST TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS THE YOUNGEST FILMMAKER AND FIRST BLACK DIRECTOR TO RECEIVE THE BEST DIRECTOR NOMINATION. THE FILM WAS A COMING OF AGE TEENAGE TALE THAT TAPPED INTO UNIVERSAL FEELINGS ABOUT COMING OF AGE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SHAPED YOU. IT HUMANIZES THE HARDSHIPS OF LIFE IN SOUTH LA AND DEMONSTRATED THE BEAUTY OF THE COMMUNITY. IT WAS A WEST COAST URBAN VERSION OF THE BREAKFAST CLUB AND SIXTEEN CANDLES. IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST IN HIS HOOD TRILOGY OF BLOCKBUSTER TEENAGE FILMS. BOYZ N. THE HOOD POETIC JUSTICE AND HIGHER LEARNING. THAT INTRODUCED AUDIENCES TO FRESH FACES THAT WOULD BECOME HOUSEHOLD NAMES IN THE FILM INDUSTRY. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION AS AN HONORABLE MENTION THAT BABY BOY IS IN THAT AS WELL AND I KNOW SO MANY FOLKS WHO COME UP TO ME DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. AND WILL GIVE ME A LINE OR A COUPLE OF LINES FROM THAT MOVIE. JOHNS ABILITY TO SHOWCASE WHAT HE SIGNED HIS NEIGHBORHOOD MADE HIM AN ACTIVIST IN ADDITION TO A REMARKABLE STORY TELLER. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO JOHN USED HIS INFLUENCE TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE ABOUT RISING HOMICIDE RATES AMONG YOUTH. AT THE COMMITTEE HEARING HE STATED MY INTENTION IS TO SHED LIGHT ON SOME THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE GETTING EMPHASIS WHEN SPEAKING TO THE VIOLENT CONDITIONS ARE CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE GOING THROUGH NOW. THE CONDITION IN WHICH THESE CHILDREN LIVE DID NOT JUST POP UP LIKE MAGIC THEY WERE CREATED. MOST OF THE GUNS THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE ARE REQUIRED THROUGH ILLEGAL MEANS AND MAY TRICKLE AND MANY TRICKLE DOWN FROM ORGANIZED EFFORTS. AND IT IS THE FACT THAT THE DRUG TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY IS LARGELY AND INTENTIONALLY CONCENTRATED MOST IN URBAN AREAS. AND IS NOT IN THE CONTROL OF THOSE THAT LIVE IN THE CITIES OR THOSE MOST ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AFTER BOYS IN THE HOOD JOHN WENT ON TO DIRECT MORE THAN TEN FILMS AND TELEVISION SERIES HIS LOVE AN INVOLVEMENT FOR OUR COMMUNITY SHOW THROUGH HIS WORK. JOHNSTONE ROSEWOOD COMPELLED AUDIENCES TO RECKON WITH OUR COUNTRY'S COMPLICATED HISTORY IN REGARD TO RACE. HIS CHAU SNOW FALL MADE AUDIENCES AWARE OF THE REALITIES IN PAIN COMMUNITY MEMBERS FACED DURING THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC. JOHN MADE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY BENEFITTED FROM HIS SUCCESS HIS FILMS DEPICTING SOUTH LA WERE FILMED ON SOUTH LA STREETS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY PLAY THE MAJOR ROLES. WHILE FILMING BOYS IN THE HOOD CROWDS WOULD ASSEMBLE. AND WATCH AND THEN SHE YEAR AFTER EACH TAKE. HIS OFFICES WERE IN CRENSHAW AND AMERICAN. JOHN WAS ALSO A LOVING AND SUPPORTIVE FATHER SON BROTHER. FRATERNITY BROTHER AND FRIEND. WHO IN ADDITION TO THE POWER OF FILM BELIEVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION BLACK CULTURE AN OLD SCHOOL MUSIC? JOHN ALSO LEFT KAYAKING IN MARINA DEL REY HE LOVES SAILING HIS BOAT JAY'S DREAM AND ONE OF HIS FAVORITE SONGS WAS ONE MORE DAY FROM LAME AS A ROB. MY SYMPATHY IS WITH HIS PARENTS HIS SEVEN CHILDREN SIBLINGS RELATIVES AND FRIENDS. UPON PASSING HIS FAMILY SHARED HOW HE STRUGGLED WITH HYPERTENSION AND ASKED ALL OF US ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO CHECK OUR PRESSURE. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT I WENT TO USC. AND I STARTED RIGHT AFTER HE GRADUATED AND HE WAS A LEGEND ON THAT CAMPUS. HE WAS AN ICON FOR MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE IN THE FILM SCHOOL IN THE THEATER SCHOOL HE WAS AN ICON FOR MANY OF THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HE WAS A LEGEND TO THE BLACK WE COMMUNITY. ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM HIS BETA OMEGA CHAPTER OF KAPPA ALPHA SIDE. HE HAD TRULY MADE IT AND HE SHOWED THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE FILM INDUSTRY WITHOUT NEPOTISM OR CONNECTIONS YOU JUST NEED A GOOD STORY. SO I ASK THAT YOU JOIN ME TODAY IN A JOURNEYING IN THE MEMORY OF THE LEGENDARY FILMMAKER JOHN SINGLETON THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMEONE NEVER COME LONGER THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY. WITH A HEAVY HEART TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY. OF MY FELLOW TROJAN. A MEMBER OF KAPPA ALPHA SIDE FRATERNITY MEMBER JOHN SINGLETON. JOHN WAS A TRUE SON OF LOS ANGELES GRADUATING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN NINETY WITH A DEGREE FROM THE SCHOOL OF CINEMATIC ARTS HAVING STUDIED SCREEN WRITING. IT IS ONLY FITTING. THAT WE ARE CELEBRATING STAR WARS DAY TODAY AS JOHN SAID CITED THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS FILM AS ONE OF THE STRONGEST INFLUENCES. JOHN WAS AN INCREDIBLE TALENT WRITING WHAT IS PERHAPS HIS MOST FAMOUS FILM BOYZ IN THE HOOD. WHILE AT USC AND THEN DIRECTING IT UPON HIS GRADUATION ANYONE SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PART OF THE BOYS IN THE HOOD. YOU KNOW THAT I WASN'T THAT GOOD OF TO CORRECT A DIRECTOR BUT BY THE END OF THE OF THE MOVIE YOU COULD SEE I HAVE PROGRESS EXTREMELY WELL. USING KNOWLEDGE FOR HIS GREAT WORK BY AT THE TENDER AGE OF TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE HE BECAME THE YOUNGEST. AND THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO BE NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS. JOHN USES MOVIES TO TELL STORIES THAT OFTEN. DON'T SEE OR OR HEARD. BOYS IN THE HOOD TELLS THE TALE OF A YOUNG MAN. THE YOUNG MAN SENT TO LIVE WITH HIS FATHER IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. SINGLE SINGLE TEN MASSIVELY PAINTS AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF LIFE IN THIS COMMUNITY. SHOWN IN EFFECTS OF TRAUMA ON YOUNG MEN. AND WOMEN. BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHICH IS RARELY SEEN IN MOVIES HE SHOWS HOW STRONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE CAN HAVE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON ANOTHER AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE IN A POSITIVE LIGHT. JOHN ALSO TOLD STORIES REAL STORIES REFUSING TO DELIVER AUDIENCES THE SAME REPEATED. TALES FOR EXAMPLE BOYZ IN THE HOOD SHOWCASES THE ROLE AS I SAID EARLIER OF A STRONG BLACK FATHER IN THE MAIN CHARACTER'S LIFE. THROUGH HIS BILL OWNS AND HIS DEEDS JOHN LEGACY WILL LIVE ON JOHN ALSO WAS A FELLOW MEMBER. OF MY FRATERNITY KAPPA ALPHA C'EST I ALSO WENT OVER A BIT -- MEGAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WENT OVER IN.

OR FANFARE HE DID IT FROM HIS HEART HE CAME ON CAMPUS TO MEET WITH STUDENTS TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS. AND HE NEVER WANTED TO GET ANY CREDIT FOR IT BAND FEAR BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL HE WAS. FORCED INCREDIBLE EFFORTS TO BENEFIT OTHERS AND FOR HIS GROUNDBREAKING CINEMATIC WORK. JOHN SINGLETON WAS HONORED AS OUTSTANDING ALUM BY THE U. S. C.
